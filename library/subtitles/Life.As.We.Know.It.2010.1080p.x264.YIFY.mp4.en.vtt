WEBVTT

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.347
Okay.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.350
- Ehh.
- Hi.

00:01:00.518 --> 00:01:01.560
- Holly.
- Eric.

00:01:01.728 --> 00:01:03.270
- Messer.
- Messer.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:07.941
- Messer. Yeah, everybody calls me Messer.
- Well, it's nice to finally meet you, Messer.

00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:10.235
- Am I late?
- Um, just an hour.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:13.906
But I just finished getting ready,
and Alison said it was your m. o., so...

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:17.284
- Peter said you'd probably say something.
- Ha, ha. Oh, did he? Oh, okay.

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:21.914
- Neat. Should we go?
- Yeah, yeah, let's go.

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:26.376
Yeah, let's get some dinner.
I'm super hungry. It's been like an hour.

00:01:26.544 --> 00:01:28.587
So I hear you just moved to Atlanta.

00:01:28.755 --> 00:01:29.922
Yep.
- Oh.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.758
- How long have you known Pete for?
- High school.

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:34.134
Oh, wow.

00:01:34.844 --> 00:01:35.969
Oh, thank you.

00:01:36.137 --> 00:01:39.264
I've known Alison since college.
We were in a sorority together.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.392
- Where's your car?
- Right here.

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.562
- Here you go.
- Oh.

00:01:46.106 --> 00:01:47.356
Come on.

00:01:47.524 --> 00:01:49.942
Hold on tight.
I promise I won't read into it.

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:54.321
- I'm not really dressed for 40-mile-an-hour-
- What?

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.365
I'm not really dressed
for 40-mile-an-hour winds.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:01:59.493
Sorry. I just-

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:03.038
You know, I don't even think
I could really get my leg up over it, so...

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.206
But I'll drive.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:08.335
My car's right here.
And it's new, so I love driving it.

00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:11.255
- It's a sweet ride.
- Thanks.

00:02:11.422 --> 00:02:12.881
Hop in.

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:21.723
All right.

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:23.308
Hm.
- Huh.

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.686
So where shall we go?

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:29.273
Uh, where did you make the reservations?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.025
That you said you were gonna make.
You didn't make them?

00:02:32.193 --> 00:02:34.069
- I said that?
- It's cool. Whatever.

00:02:34.237 --> 00:02:36.530
Yeah, it's cool.
We can go anywhere, I don't care.

00:02:36.698 --> 00:02:38.198
We can- You pick it.

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.868
We'll grab a table
and we'll just slide right in.

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:44.872
Okay. Well, how about Café Five?
You ever been there?

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.166
- Sounds good.
- My friend from culinary school is the-

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:49.877
TRICK DADDY
Pull over, that ass is too fat

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:51.461
- It's just my cell phone.
- I figured.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:53.922
- You can answer it if you-
- No, no, it'll go to voicemail.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.341
- Okay.
- Just...

00:02:56.509 --> 00:03:01.430
Yeah, well, I was just saying my friend
from culinary school is actually the-

00:03:02.056 --> 00:03:04.391
You know what?
Go ahead, just answer it, it's fine.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.103
- I'm- I can wait.
- All right. Yeah. It's a little too loud.

00:03:09.856 --> 00:03:12.107
Hey, you.

00:03:13.943 --> 00:03:17.237
Well, you know me,
always in the middle of something.

00:03:17.822 --> 00:03:19.865
Yeah, okay, yeah. Eleven?

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.785
Yeah. You know what?
Why don't we make it 10:30?

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.455
All right. All right, later.

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.081
Okay.

00:03:29.626 --> 00:03:33.670
I'm sorry, it's a... It's a sick friend.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:37.466
You know, we don't have to do this.

00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:39.426
Really?

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:43.472
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, are you serious?

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.806
Okay, let's be honest.

00:03:44.974 --> 00:03:47.392
You knew the moment you saw me
you didn't like me.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.854
But our mutual friends set this up,
so I think we owe it to them to-

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:53.899
To what,
spend a few hours faking small talk?

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:57.277
Look, best case,
we get drunk and we hook up.

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.571
What kind of an asshole are you?

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.324
Look, it's a Saturday night.
I just wanna have some fun.

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:06.995
I can go see my sick friend,
and you can go do...

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.748
...whatever it is you like to do
on a Saturday night.

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:12.876
You look like you read.
You can go read a book.

00:04:13.044 --> 00:04:16.463
- Do you blog?
- Do I blog? Okay. You know what?

00:04:16.631 --> 00:04:20.217
If you wanted to ensure that this
wasn't gonna be a lousy night, here's a tip:

00:04:20.385 --> 00:04:22.970
Don't show up an hour late,
and don't make a booty call.

00:04:23.137 --> 00:04:24.805
- She's sick.
- Oh, right.

00:04:24.973 --> 00:04:27.724
Were you going to heal her
with your magic penis?

00:04:28.851 --> 00:04:30.394
Okay.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:34.314
- Fine. If you wanna go out, we'll go out-
- Oh, my God, no.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:37.526
I'm not going out with you now.
What are you, crazy?

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:40.696
Get out of my car.
Get out of my Smart car.

00:04:42.865 --> 00:04:45.617
- I don't know what they were thinking.
- Me neither.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.038
Alison, oh, my God.
The only way you can make this up to me...

00:04:50.206 --> 00:04:52.249
...is if you promise
I never have to see him again.

00:04:57.422 --> 00:05:00.966
Really, you are like
the most important woman in my life...

00:05:01.134 --> 00:05:05.345
...and Alison is the sister I never had.

00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:10.726
And I love you so much,
and I'm so grateful for you and Peter.

00:05:12.645 --> 00:05:15.939
Look at Mess. In back.

00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.569
Nice.
Whoo.

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.118
Yeah.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.872
Anyway, I was just trying to say
how excited I am for you-

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.457
I love you. Alison.

00:05:33.624 --> 00:05:38.128
Messer, it's my turn. It's my turn.
You already gave your speech.

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:39.921
Are you maid of honor?
- Yes.

00:05:40.089 --> 00:05:42.716
Can we switch you guys out?
I need you next to the bride.

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:50.432
Get right in here with you guys.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.726
Don't touch me.
I knew you were gonna do that.

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:55.187
- Don't touch me. Don't encourage him.
Ha-ha-ha!

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:59.441
Stop it. I swear to God. Stop.

00:05:59.942 --> 00:06:02.152
I'm sorry, I can't stand next to him.

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:07.449
Hey, guys.
Here we are at the holiday party. Holly, Ben.

00:06:07.617 --> 00:06:08.909
Here you go.

00:06:09.077 --> 00:06:10.994
How's that first date going, guys?

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:13.497
I mean, what really happened? Tell me.

00:06:14.874 --> 00:06:16.875
Yo, Mess. Mess.

00:06:17.043 --> 00:06:18.502
- She has work to do.
- Dude. Dude.

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.004
- Help me. Take the camera.
- Give me the camera.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.256
Whoa, check it out.

00:06:23.424 --> 00:06:25.425
Come here.
Look at Alison's bun in the oven.

00:06:25.593 --> 00:06:28.887
Bun in the oven.
Excuse me, guys. All right? Honey?

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:31.681
Well, well, look at that.

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.060
- She's my daughter.
Won't be long now.

00:06:35.228 --> 00:06:37.229
Don't squeeze the belly.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.190
Hey, Holly. What's this?

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:45.278
Come on, just a little Christmas kiss.
Just give him a-

00:06:45.446 --> 00:06:47.572
Great. Yay, happy holidays.

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.116
You are an asshole.

00:06:49.283 --> 00:06:51.451
Hi, baby girl.

00:06:51.619 --> 00:06:53.161
Hi. Oh, my gosh.

00:06:54.539 --> 00:06:55.747
- Baby.
- Hi.

00:06:55.915 --> 00:06:57.374
Hold on, Messer, I just got her.

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:59.251
She's with Aunt Holly now.
- Dude.

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.004
- Careful, Messer. Gently.
- I got her. I got her.

00:07:03.172 --> 00:07:04.881
- Whoa!
- Oh!

00:07:05.049 --> 00:07:06.216
- Honey.
- I'm just playing.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.717
It's not funny.
- She's fine.

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:11.513
- She's like a little football.
- Would you stop it? Messer. Messer.

00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:13.098
- Okay.
- Stop it, seriously.

00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:22.399
PETER & ALISON
Cats have kittens

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:25.652
Doggies have pups

00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:30.615
Horses have pretty foals

00:07:30.867 --> 00:07:34.619
And sheep have lambs

00:07:35.037 --> 00:07:38.623
Cows have calves
And I bet you didn't know

00:07:38.791 --> 00:07:42.169
That elephants have calves too

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:45.338
Lions and leopards have cubs

00:07:45.923 --> 00:07:51.136
Which is the proper thing for them to do

00:07:56.851 --> 00:07:59.686
She's gonna blow if you keep
doing that. She's in a puking phase.

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:02.063
No, she loves it.

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:03.648
She loves it, don't you, Soph?

00:08:03.816 --> 00:08:06.401
You're the only girl I'll ever shave for.
You know that?

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:09.738
Speaking of, why didn't Liz come?
I thought you were getting serious.

00:08:09.906 --> 00:08:12.866
No, we ended that a few weeks ago.
It wasn't working out.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.576
What happened?
- I don't know.

00:08:14.744 --> 00:08:17.746
I just didn't see us
on that long march towards death together.

00:08:17.914 --> 00:08:21.958
- Oh, my bad. I thought you liked this girl.
- That was you. I just thought she was hot.

00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:24.669
Honey, don't forget
to tip the castle guys.

00:08:27.089 --> 00:08:29.007
They show up late
and made me do the work.

00:08:29.175 --> 00:08:32.385
- But, sure, let's tip the castle guys.
Grasshopper.

00:08:32.553 --> 00:08:35.263
So I started taking Sophie
to this new family practice.

00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:36.473
Mm-hm.

00:08:36.641 --> 00:08:39.935
There's this doctor there. He's so cute.

00:08:40.102 --> 00:08:43.772
I may have finally replaced
my Anderson Cooper crush.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.484
- Anyway, I noticed no ring...
- Scoot.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.945
...so I started a conversation
with his nurse.

00:08:50.112 --> 00:08:51.780
- No.
- I pretended to like her nails.

00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:55.575
- No. We agreed to a moratorium on setups.
- How do you know you won't like him?

00:08:55.743 --> 00:08:57.786
You have the worst
setup track record ever.

00:08:57.954 --> 00:09:00.705
- Like who?
- The shoplifter. Adult-braces guy.

00:09:00.873 --> 00:09:03.875
Unbelievable.
You're still holding that over me.

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:06.878
I'm not even gonna
get into the Messer Debacle of '07.

00:09:07.046 --> 00:09:09.422
Well, that was Peter.
I hardly even knew him then.

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.425
You knew he called himself Messer.
And you're my best friend.

00:09:12.593 --> 00:09:15.720
You can't be like those women
who judge me because I don't wear a ring.

00:09:15.888 --> 00:09:16.930
I'm not.

00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:19.432
In the meantime,
you keep having gorgeous babies...

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.227
...and I will keep spoiling them with this.

00:09:22.395 --> 00:09:24.896
Seriously,
that's better than my wedding cake.

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:27.482
- I made your wedding cake.
- It was a little dry.

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:31.403
Don't let any fat grown-ups in
while the kids are inside.

00:09:33.072 --> 00:09:34.823
Have you guys been smoking marijuana?

00:09:34.991 --> 00:09:37.200
- That's illegal.
- You're stoned.

00:09:37.368 --> 00:09:41.121
What are you holding? Let me see it.
Come on, you want me to call the cops?

00:09:41.289 --> 00:09:43.623
Please don't. My dad's a pastor.

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:48.837
All right, I'm taking this.
Next time, you are gonna be trouble.

00:09:49.005 --> 00:09:50.589
- Now get out of here.
- That's-

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:52.424
- Get out of here.
- Get out of here!

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:55.135
I bought that stuff.
- Totally unacceptable.

00:09:55.928 --> 00:09:58.138
Delivery kids show up
stoned out of their minds.

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.849
- Who needs a dealer?
- Aren't you respectable now?

00:10:01.017 --> 00:10:03.602
Relax. Once a year,
under the right circumstances...

00:10:03.769 --> 00:10:05.687
...Alison and I like to relive our youth.

00:10:05.855 --> 00:10:06.896
- Once a year?
- Yeah-

00:10:07.064 --> 00:10:09.733
- Yeah, right. Once a year.
- All right, maybe twice a year.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:11.818
Wanna go? Come on, come on.

00:10:12.361 --> 00:10:15.864
- Messer, do not bounce her too much.
- She's fine. She loves it, look at her.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.700
- Mess, I'm warning you.
- Come on, she's fine. Ohh!

00:10:19.368 --> 00:10:21.786
Oh, my God. She-

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:24.039
Oh, my God.

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.377
Don't worry, Sophie, you're not the first girl
to throw up on Uncle Messer.

00:10:29.545 --> 00:10:32.088
Hey, Sophie, look.
Look, that's what bitter looks like.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:35.884
Messer, go up to Peter's closet and
grab something before everyone gets here.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:37.761
- Why, what time is it?
- It's 11.

00:10:37.928 --> 00:10:41.431
Though it's only 10 in Messer time.
You know, I'm surprised you're even up.

00:10:41.932 --> 00:10:45.518
- You keep your watch on during sex.
- At least I don't wear my cap everywhere.

00:10:45.686 --> 00:10:48.855
You can take it off now.
We all know about the receding hairline.

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.608
It's a widow's peak.
I don't have a receding hairline.

00:10:51.776 --> 00:10:54.444
Hey, baby's birthday. Neutral corners.
Take a glass.

00:10:54.862 --> 00:10:57.405
First birthday,
you can take your hat off for pictures.

00:10:57.573 --> 00:10:59.574
- There it is.
- Before everyone gets here...

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:01.868
...we wanted to toast
Sophie's favorite people.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:03.078
And our best friends.

00:11:03.245 --> 00:11:06.831
We made it through her first year
with most of our sanity thanks to you guys.

00:11:06.999 --> 00:11:09.209
- We love you guys.
- Are you crying?

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:10.460
Mothers cry.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:14.881
- The babysitter's here.
- Why do you need a babysitter?

00:11:15.049 --> 00:11:16.257
Because she's a genius.

00:11:16.425 --> 00:11:18.760
When Sophie goes nuclear,
she can calm her down.

00:11:18.928 --> 00:11:22.138
- We call her the baby whisperer.
- Oh, the baby whisperer, huh?

00:11:22.306 --> 00:11:24.974
- Hey, is she hot?
- Totally hot.

00:11:25.142 --> 00:11:29.521
What's wrong with you?
- Hey, everybody, this is Amy.

00:11:30.147 --> 00:11:33.149
- Hello, Amy.
- Look who's here.

00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:35.026
Sophie.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:38.279
Let's go get you changed, hm?

00:11:38.447 --> 00:11:40.281
Thank you.

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:43.284
Are you serious?
That's the baby whisperer?

00:11:43.452 --> 00:11:46.746
Really, if she was old enough
to have sex with Peter, I'd be obsolete.

00:11:46.914 --> 00:11:49.999
- You'll never be obsolete, babe. Come here.
- Mm-hm.

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:53.086
Oh, my God. Could you step away?
You reek of baby puke.

00:11:53.254 --> 00:11:55.004
Oh, really?

00:11:55.548 --> 00:11:57.340
- You do. Get away from me.
- Excuse me.

00:11:57.508 --> 00:11:59.217
You've all met before.

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:03.096
- You met before. Remember Sophie?
- I can't believe you guys have four now.

00:12:03.264 --> 00:12:06.891
Did she have any tearing?
Oh, yeah, stem to stern.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:09.477
They had to crack that woman open
like a lobster.

00:12:09.645 --> 00:12:12.480
Excuse me.
Excuse me, miss, are you the caterer?

00:12:12.648 --> 00:12:14.774
Yes, and Alison's friend.

00:12:14.942 --> 00:12:17.068
Okay, because you need
to come and sit here.

00:12:17.236 --> 00:12:20.572
Okay? You need to come over here
right now and sit down.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:22.490
Someone is in trouble...

00:12:22.658 --> 00:12:25.160
- ... because you make food to die for.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

00:12:25.327 --> 00:12:26.369
Thank you.

00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.288
- I was a real jock back in college.
- Yeah?

00:12:28.456 --> 00:12:30.582
Mm-hm. A sprinter.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:32.542
- Really?
- Yeah, ran a 4.240.

00:12:33.002 --> 00:12:34.836
- Wow, that's fast.
- Yeah, it's fast.

00:12:35.004 --> 00:12:37.172
How else do you think I snagged
Miss Pennsylvania here?

00:12:37.339 --> 00:12:40.759
- Uh-oh. Who's talking about me? Okay.
- Oh, here she is.

00:12:40.926 --> 00:12:44.637
Okay, that's good for now.
So who is this? Hi, I'm Beth.

00:12:44.805 --> 00:12:46.014
- Messer.
- Nice to meet you.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:48.141
- Nice to meet you.
- We have not met before.

00:12:48.309 --> 00:12:50.059
I would remember this face of his.

00:12:50.227 --> 00:12:53.605
If you've got a loving partner,
you can get through anything. Hey, Scott!

00:12:53.773 --> 00:12:54.939
- Yeah, I'm-
- Scott!

00:12:55.107 --> 00:12:56.566
- Hold that. Hold on.
- Hey, Scott.

00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:58.610
- I was trying to get the boys fed.
- Okay.

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:02.822
I think Conner may have gotten himself
into a little trouble, you know what I mean?

00:13:02.990 --> 00:13:05.241
- Okay, okay.
- This is my husband, Scott.

00:13:05.409 --> 00:13:07.619
- Hi, how are you?
- It's nice to meet you. Holly.

00:13:07.787 --> 00:13:10.205
Okay. I left those diapers in the car.

00:13:10.581 --> 00:13:11.623
We used to have sex.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:14.459
We used to have sex all the time,
you know, everywhere.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:15.668
Everywhere.

00:13:15.836 --> 00:13:18.630
Then the baby needs to be fed,
the kids need to be asleep...

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:22.383
...and they have to have slept
the night before or else you're exhausted.

00:13:22.551 --> 00:13:25.845
- Hi, I'm Ted's partner, Gary.
- Busted.

00:13:26.013 --> 00:13:28.556
No, I'm actually single, I'm...

00:13:28.724 --> 00:13:32.519
- It's just me.
- Okay, okay.

00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:36.064
Well, you serve good meats and cheeses.

00:13:36.232 --> 00:13:38.858
- I think we were all talking about that.
- Thank you.

00:13:39.026 --> 00:13:44.322
That's something.
I think that's good to have as a skill.

00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:47.283
- Did you wrap those?
- Yes, I did.

00:13:47.451 --> 00:13:51.246
Look at that. She wraps.
I don't touch meat.

00:13:51.413 --> 00:13:53.164
Only with my lips.

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:58.795
ALL
Happy birthday, dear Sophie

00:13:59.296 --> 00:14:04.050
Happy birthday to you

00:14:13.644 --> 00:14:16.104
Guys, I want a picture of Sophie
with her godparents.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.814
Okay.

00:14:17.982 --> 00:14:19.315
- Amazing.
- She looks excited.

00:14:19.483 --> 00:14:20.525
Picture.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:23.111
All right, on three say,
"Messer has a widow's peak. "

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.737
One, two...

00:14:24.905 --> 00:14:26.948
- Cheese.
Sophie.

00:14:28.742 --> 00:14:30.076
Yay.

00:14:33.789 --> 00:14:37.000
Is it a good party? You want some cake?

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.642
Come on, here we go.

00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:57.353
Oh. Ohh!

00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.079
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:15:15.497 --> 00:15:17.582
You wanna get a late breakfast?

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.586
No, I can't. I got a game in an hour.
I gotta go shower.

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:28.176
- Mm. Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure. There's coffee.

00:15:28.344 --> 00:15:31.346
Oh, and mugs are in the cabinet.

00:15:47.529 --> 00:15:50.031
Ooh. This looks delicious.
- It's not ready.

00:15:50.199 --> 00:15:52.408
- I'm just taking a bite.
- The crumb is too fine.

00:15:52.576 --> 00:15:54.994
- I should've gone with Ceylon cinnamon.
- Oh, my God.

00:15:55.162 --> 00:15:57.413
- Cassia's just wrong.
- You're a genius. You are.

00:15:57.581 --> 00:16:01.501
You may be bipolar, but you're a genius.
I swear, I would eat them out of the trash.

00:16:01.669 --> 00:16:03.795
- I would, they're so good.
- That's nasty.

00:16:03.963 --> 00:16:06.547
Hey, Free-Range Turkey's here.

00:16:06.715 --> 00:16:09.884
Where you going? See, I knew it.
You do this every time he comes in.

00:16:10.052 --> 00:16:12.929
- I know you get excited.
- I'm just trying to be responsible.

00:16:13.097 --> 00:16:14.889
I'm gonna take over here. Thank you.

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:17.600
You don't act like this
when Old Man Johnson comes in.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:20.311
- Don't be a smart-ass. Go fix your cookies.
- Okay.

00:16:21.313 --> 00:16:23.022
- Hey.
- Let me guess.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:26.484
- Free-range turkey on baguette?
- I'm getting predictable, huh?

00:16:26.652 --> 00:16:30.405
Well, I like to think of it as dependable.
It's been 35 of the same sandwich.

00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:34.075
- Hm. You're counting?
- Ish. Thirty-five-ish.

00:16:34.243 --> 00:16:38.621
You know, there are other things on
the menu if you'd like to try something else.

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:40.748
- Surprise me.
- Okay. All right, great.

00:16:40.916 --> 00:16:42.750
- Do you like croissants?
- I do, yeah.

00:16:42.918 --> 00:16:45.253
Good, then I've got just the thing.

00:16:49.133 --> 00:16:52.969
How come you don't wear one of those
white coats with your name on it?

00:16:53.137 --> 00:16:54.220
So I'd know what it is.

00:16:54.388 --> 00:16:56.556
- It's Holly.
- Holly. Sam.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:17:00.143
- Nice to meet you.
- We met 35 sandwiches ago.

00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.186
Thirty-six now.

00:17:05.482 --> 00:17:09.110
- Thanks. Keep the change.
- Oh, thanks.

00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:11.571
Sure you don't wanna throw your card
in the bowl?

00:17:11.739 --> 00:17:13.448
Winner gets a free lunch.

00:17:14.658 --> 00:17:16.159
How about a free dinner on me?

00:17:21.123 --> 00:17:22.290
Eh-eh-eh.

00:17:22.458 --> 00:17:25.334
Be cool, be cool.
Let him get out the door. Damn.

00:17:26.462 --> 00:17:28.755
- Go.
- Okay. Oh, no.

00:17:28.922 --> 00:17:31.758
Which one was it?
Okay, that's a Benjamin. Oh, there's a Sam.

00:17:31.925 --> 00:17:35.303
- I could pick one for you-
- How many Sams are there in this city?

00:17:35.471 --> 00:17:39.098
And the Atlanta Hawks
trying to work it out over the other side.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:41.267
Come on, people, let's bump up the energy.

00:17:41.435 --> 00:17:43.186
It's an exciting game here. Come on.

00:17:43.353 --> 00:17:45.188
And he scores.
- Go 7.

00:17:45.355 --> 00:17:49.108
Simon, I need shooting percentages.
Ready 8. Let's zoom in on 8.

00:17:49.276 --> 00:17:51.319
More, more, more. Yep, right there. Go 8.

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:55.656
Ready 2. And go 2.
Ready 6. Where's my 6?

00:17:55.824 --> 00:17:58.659
The Hawks are about to press.
We should stay in the backcourt.

00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:01.287
- pass inbound.
Stolen by Bibby to Smith underneath.

00:18:01.455 --> 00:18:04.123
Good call, Mess.
Simon, I asked for shooting percentages.

00:18:04.291 --> 00:18:07.335
Let's go. You're too ugly not to be smarter.
Come on, let's go.

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:10.421
- I hate him so much.
Ready 4.

00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:13.007
I wanna frame somebody's murder on him,
you know?

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:15.843
- Fingerprints, scene of the crime.
- What's that, Simon?

00:18:16.011 --> 00:18:17.678
Shooting percentages coming up, sir.

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:23.851
Hi, Sam, this is Holly Berenson
from Fraiche.

00:18:24.019 --> 00:18:28.356
I think you left your card in my bowl today
for the free lunch.

00:18:28.524 --> 00:18:31.901
I hope you did, because you're one
of four Sams who did this week.

00:18:32.069 --> 00:18:35.696
And if it is you and you asked me out,
I accept.

00:18:35.864 --> 00:18:36.864
- If it's-
Hello?

00:18:37.032 --> 00:18:38.866
- Hello?
- Why are you calling my husband?

00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:42.161
- Right, you're his wife. Of course.
- We're very happily married.

00:18:42.329 --> 00:18:44.539
I understand that you're happily married.

00:18:44.706 --> 00:18:47.375
Really, I didn't mean anything by it.
I'm so sorry. Okay.

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.293
You take care. I'm sorry.

00:18:49.461 --> 00:18:51.504
- Hi, Sam?
Yes, Samantha.

00:18:51.672 --> 00:18:55.133
Oh, Samantha. Oh, it's a Samantha.
I'm sorry, I have the wrong-

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.010
Maybe not. You single?

00:18:58.178 --> 00:19:00.721
I am single, yes.

00:19:00.889 --> 00:19:04.392
Hi, Sam Nelson. Dr. Sam Nelson.

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.103
This is Holly Berenson from Fraiche...

00:19:07.271 --> 00:19:11.732
...and I am really hoping
that you're the Sam I talked to today.

00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:14.152
If not, I'm screwed
because you're the last Sam...

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.237
...who put his card in the bowl
for a free lunch.

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:18.906
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:19:19.074 --> 00:19:20.658
Call waiting.

00:19:21.535 --> 00:19:23.077
Hello?

00:19:24.663 --> 00:19:26.581
Yes, this is she.

00:19:41.763 --> 00:19:44.599
Excuse me.
I'm looking for an Officer Young.

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:47.268
The officer at the scene
found your name and number...

00:19:47.436 --> 00:19:50.938
...on an insurance contact card
in her wallet.

00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:54.609
Now, we need numbers
for the nearest next of kin.

00:19:54.776 --> 00:19:55.943
Can you supply those?

00:19:56.111 --> 00:19:58.946
Yeah. Pete's dad, um...

00:19:59.948 --> 00:20:03.075
How did you say the car flipped?
It flipped when it hit the...?

00:20:03.243 --> 00:20:07.246
- Are you sure you wouldn't like to sit down?
- They have a baby girl.

00:20:07.414 --> 00:20:10.124
Sophie. Was she in the car?
Was she in the car with them?

00:20:10.292 --> 00:20:15.129
No. She was in the care of a minor,
a babysitter, at the time of the accident.

00:20:15.297 --> 00:20:17.965
So the officers placed her with CPS
for the night.

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:20.218
- She's perfectly fine.
- CPS?

00:20:20.385 --> 00:20:22.511
Child Protective Services.

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:25.056
Where they take cases like this.

00:20:25.974 --> 00:20:27.350
Cases like this?

00:20:29.770 --> 00:20:31.103
Orphaned children.

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.840
Messer.

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:02.153
No, no, no. I just don't understand
why we can't see her tonight.

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:04.780
No, ma'am,
I don't care about your protocol. This is-

00:22:06.491 --> 00:22:10.286
Yes, I will be here at this number. Yes.

00:22:11.705 --> 00:22:13.956
They won't do anything,
not till 8 a. m. tomorrow.

00:22:14.124 --> 00:22:16.834
Okay, okay. I'm sure that she's fine.

00:22:17.336 --> 00:22:19.253
You know,
why don't we sleep here tonight?

00:22:19.421 --> 00:22:21.672
That way we're here if they call early.
All right?

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.091
- Okay.
- Why don't you take the guest bedroom?

00:22:24.259 --> 00:22:28.846
- Okay, you can take their room if you want.
- No, thank you. I'll sleep over here.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.682
- See you in the morning.
- Okay.

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:35.227
- Thanks, Messer.
- Okay.

00:23:30.325 --> 00:23:31.409
Anyone call?

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.787
Just their lawyer.

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.999
He's coming over now.
He wants to talk to us.

00:23:40.627 --> 00:23:43.295
I'm sure this is a very difficult
time for you, obviously.

00:23:43.463 --> 00:23:46.674
Everyone at the firm,
we will miss Peter very much.

00:23:47.426 --> 00:23:50.177
Now, you must have many questions.

00:23:50.345 --> 00:23:52.930
Well, Sophie.
I think that's who we're both thinking of.

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:54.682
- Yes.
- What will happen to her now?

00:23:54.850 --> 00:23:57.309
Okay, well,
I have already arranged for her transfer.

00:23:57.477 --> 00:24:00.104
The foster family she was with
will bring her to CPS.

00:24:00.272 --> 00:24:02.898
They feel she'll adjust best
in her own environment...

00:24:03.066 --> 00:24:06.485
...so first she needs to be picked up
and brought here.

00:24:06.862 --> 00:24:09.864
Okay, and who does that?

00:24:11.992 --> 00:24:16.245
I'm sorry, did Alison and Peter talk to you
about their guardianship arrangements?

00:24:16.413 --> 00:24:17.705
- No.
- No.

00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:23.419
Well, in preparing their will, we talked
about who would take care of Sophie...

00:24:23.587 --> 00:24:26.046
...in the unlikely event
that they should both die...

00:24:26.214 --> 00:24:29.508
...and they named you.

00:24:29.676 --> 00:24:30.718
Both of you.

00:24:32.387 --> 00:24:33.387
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

00:24:33.555 --> 00:24:36.849
- They picked us together?
- This isn't how you wanted to start a family.

00:24:37.017 --> 00:24:39.393
There's been a misunderstanding.
We are not married.

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:43.397
They tried to set us up on a blind date,
and we never made it to the restaurant.

00:24:43.565 --> 00:24:46.775
I don't even know if you'd call it a date.
He was such a dick.

00:24:46.943 --> 00:24:48.235
I know this is overwhelming.

00:24:48.403 --> 00:24:50.529
Believe me,
I tried to advise them against it.

00:24:50.697 --> 00:24:52.948
But there are options. You can say no.

00:24:53.116 --> 00:24:57.912
Because this is a big deal. This is a child.

00:24:58.997 --> 00:25:01.081
Big commitment.

00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:05.669
Oh, my God.

00:25:10.884 --> 00:25:12.510
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:25:26.107 --> 00:25:28.609
- Sorry.
- Options.

00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:31.987
You mentioned
that there were some other options?

00:25:32.155 --> 00:25:34.323
Yes. We have Peter's father.

00:25:34.491 --> 00:25:37.284
- Oh. Perfect. He'd be perfect, I think.
- There you go.

00:25:37.452 --> 00:25:39.870
- There's cousins.
- I'm sorry, can I stop you there?

00:25:40.038 --> 00:25:41.539
Cousins are always...
- Yeah.

00:25:41.706 --> 00:25:45.626
What if one of us, on our own,
by ourselves...

00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:48.295
...chose to honor Alison and Peter's wishes
on our own?

00:25:48.463 --> 00:25:50.923
Or both of us, hypothetically.

00:25:51.091 --> 00:25:53.425
They named you,
so I just set up a court hearing...

00:25:53.593 --> 00:25:55.844
...to grant you temporary custody,
and that's it.

00:25:56.012 --> 00:25:57.179
Now, the finances...

00:25:57.347 --> 00:26:00.057
...the estate will cover the mortgage,
but that's about it.

00:26:00.225 --> 00:26:04.687
They didn't have much in savings.
They bought this house as an investment.

00:26:04.854 --> 00:26:07.314
But, you know,
let's not get ahead of ourselves, okay?

00:26:07.482 --> 00:26:08.732
Let's just focus on Sophie.

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:09.942
- Yes.
- Right.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:15.906
So I suggest the two of you move in here
in the interim, for Sophie.

00:26:17.158 --> 00:26:19.618
- You want us to live together?
- For Sophie, for now.

00:26:19.786 --> 00:26:23.622
Until you decide what you wanna do.
But it's best.

00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:39.763
Okay. Sign here, Ms. Berenson.

00:26:45.645 --> 00:26:47.646
And here, Mr. Messer.

00:26:49.858 --> 00:26:52.484
- Thank you.
- Oh, there she is.

00:26:53.486 --> 00:26:54.945
Hi.

00:26:56.281 --> 00:26:57.823
Hi, sweet girl.

00:26:57.991 --> 00:27:00.326
Oh, honey, it's so good to see you.

00:27:03.371 --> 00:27:05.914
I know, I know.

00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:12.504
I know. Hey, look. Hey, look.

00:27:12.672 --> 00:27:16.884
You want Uncle Messer? Here.
There's Uncle Messer.

00:27:17.552 --> 00:27:20.429
Oh, God. Okay. We should get her home.

00:27:38.657 --> 00:27:42.951
- They definitely didn't think this through.
- We need to establish a sleep schedule.

00:27:43.119 --> 00:27:45.204
- It's very important.
- What?

00:27:45.372 --> 00:27:46.455
I guess.

00:27:46.915 --> 00:27:49.750
- What did you say?
- I said they didn't think this through.

00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:52.127
Did Pete say anything to you? Or Alison?

00:27:52.295 --> 00:27:54.296
- They didn't tell me anything.
- Nope.

00:27:54.464 --> 00:27:56.632
This is not the kind of thing
you forget to mention.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:59.718
"Hey, you see that game
where Kobe put the juke on that dude...

00:27:59.886 --> 00:28:01.345
...then hit the fadeaway jumper?

00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:04.473
Oh, and by the way, if I die,
I'm gonna leave you with my kid. "

00:28:04.641 --> 00:28:06.767
- It's messed up.
- Alison was a planner.

00:28:06.935 --> 00:28:09.978
- We are part of a plan.
- You wanna walk me through this plan?

00:28:10.146 --> 00:28:12.439
Are we supposed to live
in this house together?

00:28:12.774 --> 00:28:16.443
Share the place, both sleep-deprived?
Sounds like a compelling psych experiment.

00:28:16.611 --> 00:28:19.279
Assuming you and I can even afford
to pay for this place.

00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:21.115
Dunn said the mortgage is covered.

00:28:21.282 --> 00:28:24.159
Well, what about the upkeep?
Or the utilities or the taxes?

00:28:24.327 --> 00:28:26.328
You have any idea
what the nut on this is?

00:28:26.788 --> 00:28:30.124
Pete was a junior partner at a law firm.
I don't make this kind of cash.

00:28:30.291 --> 00:28:32.710
And what do you do?
You bake scones for a living?

00:28:32.877 --> 00:28:35.254
I run a successful business.
I do pretty well.

00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:38.006
Yeah? Well, running a baby
is not like running a bakery.

00:28:38.174 --> 00:28:40.843
- I didn't say it was.
- They're a mess. They pee on things.

00:28:41.010 --> 00:28:43.137
They bite. They're basically dogs.

00:28:43.304 --> 00:28:45.848
Except at least a dog knows
not to lick the electrical sockets.

00:28:47.267 --> 00:28:49.309
She's up. She's up.

00:28:49.477 --> 00:28:53.939
- Okay, honey. Hey. Hi.
- Hey. Hey, look at the sleepyhead.

00:28:54.107 --> 00:28:55.274
Hi, honey.
- Here we go.

00:28:55.442 --> 00:28:56.483
Hey, come here.

00:28:56.651 --> 00:28:58.110
- No, no, don't pick her up.
- Why?

00:28:58.278 --> 00:29:00.362
Because she needs to learn
how to self-soothe.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:03.365
- She needs to what?
- Self-soothe. Soothe herself.

00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:06.660
I just read it, Messer. It's important.
Let's just give it a minute.

00:29:06.828 --> 00:29:10.080
Everything's okay. Happy, happy girl.

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:13.667
You know what? Let's just sing a song.
We'll sing a song.

00:29:13.835 --> 00:29:16.503
The wheels on the bus go round and round

00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:18.839
Round and round
Round and round

00:29:19.007 --> 00:29:21.633
The wheels on the bus go round and round

00:29:21.801 --> 00:29:23.844
All through the town

00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:25.971
The- I don't know.

00:29:26.139 --> 00:29:28.474
- And then Keanu Reeves saves the bus
- Nice.

00:29:28.641 --> 00:29:30.601
Saves the bus
Saves the bus

00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.936
And then Keanu Reeves saves the bus

00:29:33.396 --> 00:29:35.189
- And then he dies
- That's all I got.

00:29:35.356 --> 00:29:36.565
Does he die? I don't know.

00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:39.818
Okay. Maybe she's hungry.
I think she's hungry. I'm gonna feed her.

00:29:39.986 --> 00:29:43.155
- Come on, let's go eat. Come on.
- I thought we weren't picking her up.

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:51.789
- Okay, Sophie, I'm almost done, hold on.
- She's not a food critic. She's a 1-year-old.

00:29:51.956 --> 00:29:55.209
- I'm not gonna feed her just anything.
- But we're gonna feed you today.

00:29:55.376 --> 00:29:57.294
Hopefully before you're 2.

00:29:57.921 --> 00:30:01.465
So tell me, what does Sophie do
to your dreams of ever meeting a guy...

00:30:01.633 --> 00:30:03.842
...and having your own baby?
Thought about that?

00:30:04.010 --> 00:30:06.512
A woman your age
already has a hard time competing...

00:30:06.679 --> 00:30:08.388
...for the few guys who don't suck.

00:30:08.556 --> 00:30:10.766
I'm sorry,
did you just say a woman my age?

00:30:10.934 --> 00:30:13.560
In the dating world,
you wouldn't be considered single.

00:30:13.728 --> 00:30:16.605
You know what you'd be? Complicated.
Beyond complicated.

00:30:16.773 --> 00:30:18.440
You don't know anything about me.

00:30:18.608 --> 00:30:21.443
Well, I know that you can't open
a childproof drawer.

00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:24.655
Oh. There it is.

00:30:25.406 --> 00:30:28.742
Why are you trying so hard
to convince me not to help her?

00:30:28.910 --> 00:30:31.703
I'm not trying to.
I'm just trying to do what's best for her.

00:30:31.871 --> 00:30:35.582
- You're trying to do what's best for you.
- I'm trying to do what's best for her.

00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:37.084
We're not it.

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:39.920
They loved Sophie more than anything
in the entire world...

00:30:40.088 --> 00:30:42.422
...and out of everyone, Messer,
they picked us.

00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:44.258
They picked us.

00:30:46.469 --> 00:30:47.803
I'm coming.

00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:50.931
Check this out.
I think you're gonna love it.

00:30:51.099 --> 00:30:54.226
Taste sensation. Ready?

00:30:54.394 --> 00:30:55.769
Mmm.

00:30:56.104 --> 00:31:00.274
No? Come on. Just try it, Soph.
Just try it. I think you're gonna love it.

00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:02.693
Just try it.

00:31:03.361 --> 00:31:05.445
Come on, Soph, give it a try.

00:31:05.613 --> 00:31:07.990
Oh, please?
I've seen you eat things like this.

00:31:08.616 --> 00:31:10.701
I think you're gonna love it. Come on.

00:31:10.952 --> 00:31:13.495
Mmm. Mmm. Yum, yum, yum.

00:31:13.663 --> 00:31:16.290
There you go. Good girl, Soph-

00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:30.429
So you honestly think
we're the best thing for her?

00:31:56.289 --> 00:31:58.165
- Well, it was a beautiful service.
- Yeah.

00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:01.335
- I did not know that's how they met.
- Oh, that story about Paris?

00:32:01.502 --> 00:32:02.753
- Are you kidding me?
Yeah.

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.047
What is gonna happen with the baby?
Do we know?

00:32:05.214 --> 00:32:06.798
- Oh, yeah, you didn't hear?
- No.

00:32:06.966 --> 00:32:11.428
They named one of their friends, yeah.
The single girl who bakes.

00:32:11.596 --> 00:32:14.681
And the super-hot one that always smells,
like, so good and sweaty.

00:32:14.849 --> 00:32:17.184
- That guy.
- That's interesting. So he'll be around.

00:32:17.352 --> 00:32:19.728
- "Good"?
- What do you mean, "good and sweaty"?

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.233
Mom, thank you for being here.
I couldn't have done it without you.

00:32:25.401 --> 00:32:27.945
- You're welcome.
- Mind watching her for another minute?

00:32:28.112 --> 00:32:30.781
- I gotta talk to Messer.
- Okay.

00:32:30.949 --> 00:32:32.407
Mess.

00:32:34.243 --> 00:32:37.746
- There's a lot of them.
- Well, we just need to find one.

00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:41.708
- So I understand you're Peter's cousins?
- Hey, don't climb on that. Hey, hey.

00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:43.460
- Who is that, Tyler?
- Mason.

00:32:43.628 --> 00:32:45.754
Mason, take a seat right now. Let's go.

00:32:45.922 --> 00:32:48.465
- Eight kids.
- Eight kids? You guys have eight kids?

00:32:48.633 --> 00:32:52.886
- Nine, dear.
- Nine, right. Baseball team.

00:32:54.389 --> 00:32:58.225
- I had to come for Alison.
- Yeah, thank you.

00:32:58.393 --> 00:33:01.103
- And I was on tour through Atlanta, so...
- Oh, on tour.

00:33:01.729 --> 00:33:03.814
Are you performing anywhere
that I would know?

00:33:03.982 --> 00:33:05.565
I'm dancing at Juggles tonight...

00:33:05.733 --> 00:33:08.485
...and then Bush League
Thursday through Monday.

00:33:08.653 --> 00:33:12.406
Oh, how exciting.
That's really exciting. Yeah.

00:33:12.573 --> 00:33:15.742
It's really good for Sophie
to get to see her grandfather.

00:33:17.078 --> 00:33:19.538
She looks just like Peter.

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:22.290
I think she looks just like you.

00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:25.961
So you have a house in Miami now?

00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:28.046
Yeah, because we, you know,
were hoping...

00:33:28.214 --> 00:33:31.216
...given that Sophie
is your only grandchild, that...

00:33:31.384 --> 00:33:33.927
Well, it seems to make the most sense
that you'd be-

00:33:34.095 --> 00:33:36.388
Oh!
Okay, okay, okay.

00:33:36.556 --> 00:33:39.141
Sophie, no, no, no. Over here.

00:33:39.308 --> 00:33:41.643
Oh, I am so sorry. Okay.

00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:43.520
You okay? Okay.

00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:45.397
- Good as new.
- Still breathing.

00:33:45.606 --> 00:33:47.190
Yay.

00:33:57.952 --> 00:34:01.288
Well, we could go
with the nine-kids family.

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:04.958
I mean, they clearly know
how to keep a child alive.

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.463
Stripper seemed nice.

00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.507
Yeah.

00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:17.304
And the grandpa's a definite no?

00:34:19.682 --> 00:34:21.683
We're screwed.

00:34:22.602 --> 00:34:28.857
Next case, the matter of
Sophie Novak, Index Number 05893-01.

00:34:29.025 --> 00:34:30.067
All right.

00:34:30.234 --> 00:34:32.652
I've read your submissions,
along with the will.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.781
Given that you folks were named
as guardians...

00:34:35.948 --> 00:34:38.492
...I see no reason
to countermand the parents' wishes.

00:34:38.659 --> 00:34:40.285
However, permit-

00:34:44.290 --> 00:34:46.083
Just leave it.
No, no.

00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:49.294
- They're gonna get ground into the carpet.
- Guys, guys, okay.

00:34:49.462 --> 00:34:52.005
Let's leave the Goldfish.
What do you say we stand up?

00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:54.841
- Okay. Okay.
- Stand up. Leave them.

00:34:55.301 --> 00:34:56.885
Sorry.

00:34:57.678 --> 00:34:59.137
- I'll pick these up.
- Just...

00:34:59.305 --> 00:35:03.350
Until that time, I hereby grant
joint legal and physical custody...

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:07.354
...of Sophie Christina Novak
to Holly Berenson and Eric Messer.

00:35:08.856 --> 00:35:11.399
That's it?
You're not gonna ask us anything?

00:35:11.567 --> 00:35:13.360
How do you know we're not dealers
or pimps?

00:35:13.528 --> 00:35:14.528
Ha!

00:35:14.695 --> 00:35:18.031
- Are you drug dealers or pimps?
- No, ma'am. No.

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.616
Let's go.

00:35:20.243 --> 00:35:21.701
Boom. "Done, next case.

00:35:21.869 --> 00:35:24.037
Here, take a kid.
No, take two, we got extra. "

00:35:24.205 --> 00:35:27.165
Where is that stupid duck that she loves
that drives me crazy?

00:35:28.543 --> 00:35:30.585
I don't get it, man. I've been good.
Some chick says:

00:35:30.753 --> 00:35:34.339
"Messer, you can forget the condom,"
I say no, and I still end up with a kid.

00:35:34.507 --> 00:35:37.175
We need to figure out a schedule.
I need to work tomorrow.

00:35:37.343 --> 00:35:38.552
- Do you smell that?
- What?

00:35:38.719 --> 00:35:42.389
- Oh, maybe she finally pooped. Did she?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think she-

00:35:42.557 --> 00:35:44.683
What? It's not that bad.

00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:46.643
Oh, Soph.

00:35:46.811 --> 00:35:49.271
It's a weird smell, right?
Okay.

00:35:50.231 --> 00:35:53.775
- Go ahead.
- What? Why me? Because I'm the girl?

00:35:53.943 --> 00:35:55.235
- Yeah.
- No. Uh-uh.

00:35:55.403 --> 00:35:57.946
I am not changing diapers
for the next two years.

00:35:58.114 --> 00:36:01.032
- Get in there.
- Okay, fine. Easy. It's not that...

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:04.286
Something you can take off the checklist.
Check.

00:36:06.873 --> 00:36:08.456
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

00:36:08.624 --> 00:36:11.251
It's not a bra that I'm taking off a chick,
it's a diaper.

00:36:11.419 --> 00:36:14.254
- It's not rocket science. Take the tabs off.
- Is there a box I can read?

00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:16.631
See those little tabs? Undo them.

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:24.139
Oh, God. Don't do that.
You're gonna make me throw up.

00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:27.684
- It's like Slumdog Millionaire in there.
- You're gonna make me throw up.

00:36:27.852 --> 00:36:29.603
She didn't eat enough to produce that.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.606
- She's getting it in her toes.
- Okay, give me the wipes.

00:36:32.773 --> 00:36:35.317
- Give me another one.
- Hurry. Get it out of her toes.

00:36:35.484 --> 00:36:36.610
What, it's like a poop suit.

00:36:38.196 --> 00:36:41.615
- Oh, I got it.
- Messer. Don't leave me in here.

00:36:42.074 --> 00:36:43.325
Oh, God.

00:36:46.954 --> 00:36:48.622
Oh, it's burning my eyes.

00:36:48.789 --> 00:36:51.458
I'm getting the feeling
this is a reconnaissance mission.

00:36:51.626 --> 00:36:53.084
No one else is thinking that.

00:36:53.252 --> 00:36:54.669
- Oh, hi.
Hi.

00:36:54.837 --> 00:36:56.254
- Hi.
- Hello.

00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:58.548
- Surprise.
- The athlete.

00:36:58.716 --> 00:37:00.383
- Yeah, how's it going?
My Two Dads.

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:02.677
- What's up, buddy?
- Here comes the block.

00:37:02.845 --> 00:37:03.970
What's going on?

00:37:04.138 --> 00:37:07.641
Just, you know, bringing you
some covered dishes and whatnot.

00:37:07.808 --> 00:37:10.393
New parents, gotta stock the fridge.
One, two, three.

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:11.895
Just because. Ha, ha!

00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:17.108
- Come on in.
- Oh, how unexpected.

00:37:17.276 --> 00:37:18.568
Hope it's not a bad time.

00:37:18.736 --> 00:37:22.280
Okay. Look at that, all clean.

00:37:22.448 --> 00:37:25.909
Hey, the neighborhood watch is here.
They brought us some-

00:37:26.577 --> 00:37:29.162
What? She's perfect, no thanks to you.

00:37:29.330 --> 00:37:33.750
- Holly, you have a-
- Save it, Messer. You big coward.

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:36.628
Okay. Come on.

00:37:38.923 --> 00:37:40.757
Hey.
What a surprise.

00:37:40.925 --> 00:37:43.385
Hey, guys, we weren't expecting you.
What a surprise.

00:37:44.095 --> 00:37:45.595
Oh.

00:37:45.763 --> 00:37:46.930
What?

00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.349
Sweetie, you have shit on your face.

00:37:51.185 --> 00:37:52.560
- So...
- Yeah.

00:37:57.984 --> 00:37:59.943
- Who's hungry?
- I am.

00:38:00.111 --> 00:38:01.444
- This one.
- Should we dive in?

00:38:01.612 --> 00:38:04.030
- You got a little more, on the right.
- Just shut up.

00:38:04.198 --> 00:38:05.198
- Okay.
- I swear.

00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:07.409
I'm just trying to help.

00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:15.166
- You doing okay? You look a little tired.
- That would be the not sleeping.

00:38:15.334 --> 00:38:17.085
- Doesn't show.
- You don't look tired.

00:38:17.253 --> 00:38:20.171
Don't worry, because you're not
gonna sleep for 10 years.

00:38:20.339 --> 00:38:21.381
Surprise.

00:38:21.549 --> 00:38:24.092
And you're never gonna
get used to children's music.

00:38:24.260 --> 00:38:25.302
Oh, God.
No.

00:38:25.469 --> 00:38:29.097
If I knew where the Wiggles lived,
and I'm working on it...

00:38:29.265 --> 00:38:31.141
...I would murder them with an AK-47.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:32.934
- I'm very serious.
- No new parents-

00:38:33.102 --> 00:38:35.312
I don't think any of us knew
what we were doing.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:36.771
- Not a clue.
Not a clue.

00:38:36.939 --> 00:38:41.234
I mean, we had nine months to get ready
and we still screw up about half the time.

00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:44.362
- He sure does.
- No, I said "we," actually.

00:38:44.905 --> 00:38:47.032
Do you know what?
I'm gonna get real serious.

00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:49.909
You gotta get two things straight.
One, get a sitter.

00:38:50.077 --> 00:38:51.411
- And a backup.
- Absolutely.

00:38:51.579 --> 00:38:52.954
Yeah.
Next, important:

00:38:53.122 --> 00:38:56.458
- You can never have enough paper towels.
And don't shop at Shop Now.

00:38:56.625 --> 00:38:59.377
They're always out of milk
and don't carry unscented wipes.

00:38:59.545 --> 00:39:01.504
When you order Motrin, get the dye-free.

00:39:01.672 --> 00:39:05.008
Oh, no BPAs. Sippy cups, any plastics.
You don't want those chemicals.

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:07.594
Alison wanted Sophie to go
to Big Wagon Preschool...

00:39:07.762 --> 00:39:10.221
...so you may wanna think
about making donations.

00:39:10.389 --> 00:39:11.431
Like, yesterday.

00:39:11.599 --> 00:39:15.185
Okay, maybe we should start
to write this down.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.278
One bite, one bite, one bite.

00:39:32.995 --> 00:39:34.412
The week.
- Can't do that.

00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:36.623
You're writing my name.
- I already did-

00:39:36.791 --> 00:39:40.293
There we go. Okay, Sophie girl.

00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:43.129
- Your bath time, your bath time.
- Oh! Okay, get the baby.

00:39:43.297 --> 00:39:45.924
- Your bath time, your bath time.
- All right.

00:39:46.509 --> 00:39:48.676
All right, how about that?

00:39:48.844 --> 00:39:50.345
No?

00:39:51.847 --> 00:39:53.556
How about this one?

00:39:54.642 --> 00:39:56.142
No?

00:40:17.373 --> 00:40:19.624
Patterson with the turnaround.

00:40:19.792 --> 00:40:21.167
Yeah!

00:40:22.878 --> 00:40:25.380
What? You wanna watch something else?

00:40:25.548 --> 00:40:26.714
He shoots-

00:40:27.466 --> 00:40:29.801
No, come on, missed the...

00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:33.638
It's time to wiggle.

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.079
There we go.

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.129
You okay? You okay? Good.
Okay. I'm sorry.

00:41:09.508 --> 00:41:11.092
Please?

00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:18.433
- She's making the poop face.
- What do you mean?

00:41:18.601 --> 00:41:20.810
Poop face.
Oh, God, she's gonna poop in the tub.

00:41:20.978 --> 00:41:23.021
Hurry up, hurry up.
She's gonna poop on me.

00:41:23.189 --> 00:41:25.648
- I don't know how to do this.
- She's gonna poop on me.

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:29.277
You know what? Move, move. Let me do it.
Here. Just take her. I got it.

00:41:29.737 --> 00:41:32.614
- Come on. I hate this thing.
- There's a latch. Pull the lever-

00:41:32.781 --> 00:41:36.201
- Okay. Don't start. Sorry.
- No, no, no, not the hat.

00:41:36.368 --> 00:41:38.286
Oh, my God, that's my hat.

00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:40.872
That's my-
I've had that hat since high school.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.500
- I'll wash it.
- Oh, yeah. Oh, it's funny.

00:41:43.667 --> 00:41:48.922
Yeah, laugh it off. Laugh it off.
Okay, that's real funny.

00:41:49.089 --> 00:41:51.049
Oh, God.

00:41:51.217 --> 00:41:54.093
Um, I think we should just...

00:42:00.476 --> 00:42:02.101
- Hey, what is that?
- What?

00:42:02.269 --> 00:42:04.771
That lump. What's that?

00:42:04.939 --> 00:42:06.898
- That's her bellybutton.
- No, it's not.

00:42:07.066 --> 00:42:09.484
That wasn't there.
That was not there a few days ago.

00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:12.403
- It's just an outie, isn't it?
- No, it's not an outie.

00:42:13.614 --> 00:42:14.948
I don't think.

00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:17.992
How does this...?

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.120
What are these numbers on here?
What does that mean?

00:42:21.288 --> 00:42:22.372
Why is this...?

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.876
No one's gonna steal a stroller.

00:42:27.044 --> 00:42:29.504
We can't afford to be snobby.
It's our biggest event.

00:42:29.672 --> 00:42:31.381
Bring out all the crowd pleasers.

00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:34.300
Anything wrapped in bacon,
and the mushroom vol-au-vent.

00:42:34.468 --> 00:42:36.636
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:42:37.137 --> 00:42:39.264
- I gotta call you back.
- Holly.

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:40.682
Free-Range Turkey.

00:42:41.642 --> 00:42:45.019
- Dr. Free-Range Turkey.
- Yes, Sam. I remember.

00:42:45.187 --> 00:42:47.397
I heard about the accident.

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:49.983
I am so sorry about your friends.

00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:51.401
Thank you.

00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:55.446
Hey, you left me a half-message,
only it was the half without your number.

00:42:55.614 --> 00:42:58.324
Yeah, something- Someone came up.

00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:02.495
- How we doing?
- It's all right, sweetheart.

00:43:03.747 --> 00:43:07.417
Is she sleeping okay?
Regular bowel movements?

00:43:07.585 --> 00:43:10.795
Not at first, but now very regular.

00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:13.298
But she does have this protrusion
on her stomach.

00:43:13.465 --> 00:43:17.385
I don't know, you know, what it is.
I'm not sure what I'm supposed to look for.

00:43:17.553 --> 00:43:20.221
I don't really know anything about kids.

00:43:20.389 --> 00:43:22.807
Alison was the first of my friends
to have a baby...

00:43:22.975 --> 00:43:24.726
...and she was amazing with Sophie.

00:43:24.893 --> 00:43:28.021
And she would be the first person
I would call about this, you know?

00:43:28.188 --> 00:43:31.274
I mean, she was the first person I called
about everything and...

00:43:31.442 --> 00:43:34.569
God. It is killing me.

00:43:34.737 --> 00:43:37.655
It is killing me right now
that I can't call my friend.

00:43:37.823 --> 00:43:39.866
She just...

00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:43.286
And I'd really like to say,
"What the hell were you thinking?

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.622
You could've left me your pearls
or YSL clutch.

00:43:45.789 --> 00:43:47.206
I mean, this is a little much.

00:43:47.374 --> 00:43:50.877
It's really, really hard,
and I don't know what I'm doing. "

00:43:51.045 --> 00:43:53.212
I don't know what I'm doing.

00:44:00.971 --> 00:44:02.055
I'm sorry.

00:44:02.473 --> 00:44:04.724
No, I think you're doing pretty well,
considering.

00:44:05.934 --> 00:44:09.187
Sophie's got an umbilical hernia.

00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:13.358
It's nothing to worry about.
Most go away on their own. We'll watch it.

00:44:13.525 --> 00:44:15.693
- Then I didn't do it?
- No, you did not do it.

00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:17.528
Okay.

00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:22.325
I thought you said it goes away
on its own.

00:44:23.577 --> 00:44:24.661
That's for you.

00:44:27.581 --> 00:44:30.333
"One bottle of Pinot Noir,
one to two glasses as needed. "

00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.543
Or white. Same dosage, though.

00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:37.757
Look, what you're doing is pretty incredible.
Give yourself a break every now and again.

00:44:37.925 --> 00:44:40.968
- Thank you.
- I'll have my nurse set you up in a week?

00:44:41.136 --> 00:44:42.303
- Okay.
- All right.

00:44:42.471 --> 00:44:45.139
Bye, Sophie. You're gonna be okay.

00:44:45.683 --> 00:44:48.267
- Nice to see you.
- You too, really.

00:44:49.770 --> 00:44:51.854
So I'm at the drugstore...

00:44:52.022 --> 00:44:55.191
...and it dawns on me
that women stare at men carrying a baby...

00:44:55.359 --> 00:44:58.361
...like a guy will stare at a woman
with a great rack.

00:44:59.988 --> 00:45:02.115
You know what I just realized today?

00:45:02.282 --> 00:45:04.534
I am never gonna take a great bath
in this house.

00:45:04.702 --> 00:45:07.745
This is a shower house.
You never brush your hair, do you?

00:45:07.913 --> 00:45:11.124
It must save so much time.
That's so handy.

00:45:11.291 --> 00:45:13.042
- How's that wine treating you?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.293
Mm-hm.

00:45:14.461 --> 00:45:15.962
- Did you want some?
- No, no, no.

00:45:16.130 --> 00:45:18.506
Because I can share. I'm a good sharer.

00:45:18.966 --> 00:45:22.051
No, you don't need any,
because you never worry.

00:45:22.678 --> 00:45:25.555
That's what Alison told me, you know,
when she set us up.

00:45:25.723 --> 00:45:29.600
She said, "Honey, you just got your ass
dumped by your boyfriend of three years.

00:45:29.768 --> 00:45:34.313
You need to go have a good time. "
And then, ta-da, you show up.

00:45:34.481 --> 00:45:36.065
Your charming self shows up...

00:45:36.233 --> 00:45:38.484
...and you don't even wanna go
to the restaurant.

00:45:38.652 --> 00:45:42.822
My first date in three years,
and it's a total asshole at the door.

00:45:44.324 --> 00:45:46.367
And now I'm raising a kid
with that asshole.

00:45:46.535 --> 00:45:49.495
- God, the irony.
- Come on, off to bed. Up, up, up.

00:45:49.663 --> 00:45:53.499
You are, you know that, right? An asshole?
It feels good to say that to your face.

00:45:53.667 --> 00:45:56.919
- Been saying it behind your back for years.
- A belligerent drunk. Great.

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.337
That'll be a fun next 18 years.

00:45:59.673 --> 00:46:03.092
Everybody thinks I'm a fun drunk.
Someone's at the door. Who is it?

00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:04.802
It's probably a neighbor.

00:46:06.138 --> 00:46:08.097
- Yes?
- Hi, I'm Janine Groff.

00:46:09.099 --> 00:46:10.975
Your caseworker from Social Services.

00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:13.186
Yeah.

00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:15.813
You were told
we'd be making a few unannounced visits.

00:46:16.356 --> 00:46:17.523
Ow.

00:46:18.025 --> 00:46:20.443
Yeah, well,
this is definitely unannounced.

00:46:21.153 --> 00:46:23.446
- Just give me one minute.
- May I come in? No?

00:46:23.614 --> 00:46:25.364
- Who is that?
- Social Services.

00:46:25.532 --> 00:46:27.033
You got five minutes to shower...

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:30.703
...and start acting like the responsible pain
you've been since we moved in.

00:46:30.871 --> 00:46:32.997
- Okay.
- Go, go, go.

00:46:34.416 --> 00:46:36.417
Upstair- Upstairs.
Your room is up here, remember?

00:46:37.795 --> 00:46:38.920
- I'm sorry.
- Go, go, go.

00:46:39.087 --> 00:46:42.381
- I'm going. Stop pushing me. Don't push.
- Just- I didn't...

00:46:42.549 --> 00:46:44.675
You sure you don't wanna see
the garage again?

00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:45.927
Nope, twice is my limit.

00:46:46.094 --> 00:46:49.096
I have a whole area of tools
you didn't even get a chance to see.

00:46:49.264 --> 00:46:51.390
I'm good.
I'm usually wrapping up by now and-

00:46:51.558 --> 00:46:55.269
Hello. I'm so sorry.
I had to get the little one down.

00:46:57.606 --> 00:46:58.773
Oh.

00:46:58.941 --> 00:47:02.610
And you can see why. Take your eyes
off her for one minute and, zoom!

00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:05.696
You know? Just "tee-tee-tee-tee-tee"
on her little legs.

00:47:06.532 --> 00:47:09.700
Okay, well, let's get started, then.

00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:11.953
Okay, so let's just talk.

00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:15.373
You know, I just wanna get a sense
of the both of you, your plans.

00:47:15.541 --> 00:47:17.416
Where do you see yourselves
in five years?

00:47:17.584 --> 00:47:18.626
Ooh, ooh! Ooh!

00:47:18.794 --> 00:47:20.711
- Ask me. I know. Great answer.
- You don't-

00:47:20.879 --> 00:47:21.921
No, I'm good, I'm good.

00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:26.175
I own a small gourmet-food store,
soon to be a small gourmet restaurant.

00:47:26.343 --> 00:47:29.053
We're expanding.
New flooring, I'm thinking hexagonal tile.

00:47:29.221 --> 00:47:31.931
New flooring.
That's part of everyone's five-year plans.

00:47:32.099 --> 00:47:33.099
Flooring, right?

00:47:33.267 --> 00:47:36.227
Anyway, I'm also hoping someday
to have my own frozen-food line.

00:47:36.395 --> 00:47:39.522
Organic. But that's the 10-year plan.
You asked about the five-year.

00:47:39.690 --> 00:47:41.357
Oh, God, I didn't include Sophie.

00:47:41.525 --> 00:47:43.317
You didn't.
- Let me just take it back.

00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:46.445
- She is a big part of my plan.
- That's fine. Thank you.

00:47:47.072 --> 00:47:49.240
- Okay.
- Eric.

00:47:51.034 --> 00:47:53.286
- Yep, Eric's good. Eric will be fine.
- Okay, Eric.

00:47:53.787 --> 00:47:57.832
Well, I'm the technical director
on all Hawks broadcasts.

00:47:58.417 --> 00:47:59.792
- Okay.
Yeah.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.794
So, what does the technical director do?

00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:06.382
Well, when the director says,
"Ready, go Camera 1," I'm the guy that-

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:10.511
- I push the button that goes Camera 1.
- He pushes the button.

00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.471
And I guess in a couple years...

00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:16.183
...when the boss gets kicked upstairs
or gets pinched with a tranny hooker...

00:48:16.351 --> 00:48:18.561
...I'll get my shot in the director's chair.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:23.524
Okay. So Mr. Dunn tells me
that you're both single...

00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:28.112
...and presently not engaged
in a relationship.

00:48:28.280 --> 00:48:29.864
- Not sleeping together?
- God, no.

00:48:30.032 --> 00:48:31.365
- Okay, good.
Oh, my God, no.

00:48:31.533 --> 00:48:33.367
- No, no, no.
- Not a chance.

00:48:33.535 --> 00:48:35.620
Okay, that's great,
because this situation...

00:48:35.787 --> 00:48:38.664
...two single people
living under the same roof...

00:48:38.832 --> 00:48:42.668
...raising a recently orphaned child,
well, it's complicated enough...

00:48:42.836 --> 00:48:46.255
...without the added complication of,
you know, that.

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:49.842
Oh, trust me, Janine, we will not
be complicating anything with that.

00:48:50.010 --> 00:48:51.719
Yeah, I get plenty of that elsewhere.

00:48:51.887 --> 00:48:54.847
- I'd get plenty of that in my day as well.
- Way back in the day.

00:48:55.015 --> 00:48:56.474
Listen.

00:48:56.642 --> 00:48:59.477
You two both seem like two sweet,
doe-eyed people...

00:48:59.686 --> 00:49:01.812
...about to have the worst year
of your lives.

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.941
I'll be honest with you.
Wanna make jokes about tranny hookers?

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:06.275
Go for it, I don't care.

00:49:06.443 --> 00:49:09.070
You have no idea the types of families
that I deal with.

00:49:09.237 --> 00:49:12.073
Tranny hookers? They're my good cases.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:13.908
The only obstacle here is you two...

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:17.078
...and whether or not you're both cut out
to be parents.

00:49:17.245 --> 00:49:21.415
What we want to avoid is Sophie
losing more people that she's close to.

00:49:22.834 --> 00:49:27.672
You know, your friends thought
you could do this, but I'll be honest...

00:49:27.839 --> 00:49:29.882
...I'm not so sure.

00:49:32.928 --> 00:49:36.138
How can I be hung-over
if I haven't even gone to sleep yet?

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:39.392
Look, all we have to do is put her down.
We just gotta put her-

00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:44.021
She's not warm. She doesn't have a fever.
She's just overtired.

00:49:44.189 --> 00:49:47.066
- What time is it?
- It's okay, Soph. Come on, honey.

00:49:47.234 --> 00:49:50.987
- I don't know. Start wearing a watch.
- There's gotta be somebody we can call.

00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:53.990
Hey, thank you for coming over.
It's okay.

00:49:54.157 --> 00:49:57.451
Sorry about your dad.
He's a pretty scary dude, huh?

00:49:57.744 --> 00:49:59.578
- Come here, Sophie.
- The baby whisperer.

00:49:59.746 --> 00:50:00.788
It's okay.
- Yeah.

00:50:00.956 --> 00:50:01.998
Thank you, Amy.

00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:09.588
I don't know why,
but this fan always helps.

00:50:09.756 --> 00:50:12.717
- Beats having to take her for a drive.
Yeah.

00:50:12.884 --> 00:50:15.886
Anyway, big math test tomorrow, so...

00:50:17.931 --> 00:50:19.140
Give her some money.

00:50:19.307 --> 00:50:20.850
Oh, Amy, Amy.

00:50:22.436 --> 00:50:25.146
It's okay.
Doesn't feel right to take it anymore.

00:50:25.313 --> 00:50:26.439
Okay.

00:50:26.606 --> 00:50:28.441
- Give her the money.
- No, I insist.

00:50:30.235 --> 00:50:32.945
- Thank you so much.
Thank you.

00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:35.656
- Good luck on your math test.
- Okay, bye-bye.

00:50:35.824 --> 00:50:38.784
- Oh, thank God. Whew.
- I know.

00:50:40.370 --> 00:50:43.748
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no.

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:47.668
Too close. You're holding her too-
Look, you're gonna chop her head off.

00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:50.171
- That's what the babysitter was doing.
- She wasn't.

00:50:50.338 --> 00:50:52.757
No, she was soothing her down here.

00:50:52.924 --> 00:50:55.801
We're gonna go for a drive.
We're gonna drive around the block.

00:50:55.969 --> 00:50:58.554
- Just go. Just go.
- Nice and quick. Nice and quick.

00:50:58.722 --> 00:51:01.432
All right, we're just gonna go
for a ride around the block.

00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:03.642
We'll get back in time for the game, huh?

00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:05.478
Yeah.

00:51:30.003 --> 00:51:31.045
Hi.

00:51:31.379 --> 00:51:35.007
Mm-hm. Absolutely.
Yeah, I'm on my way now. Okay.

00:51:35.175 --> 00:51:37.843
Yeah, really, thank you so much.
All right, bye-bye.

00:51:38.011 --> 00:51:39.512
Yes!

00:51:39.679 --> 00:51:42.932
Yes. Burke's out, and I finally got the call
to direct today's game.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:46.435
- Today is my Riverside event. I told you.
- You never told me that.

00:51:46.603 --> 00:51:49.188
You just don't listen to women
who won't sleep with you.

00:51:49.356 --> 00:51:51.816
See it there on the board?
I'll be home at 7:30.

00:51:51.983 --> 00:51:54.443
Come on, I can't.
There are no kids in the booth.

00:51:54.611 --> 00:51:56.862
- Come on, work with me here.
- It's on the board.

00:51:57.030 --> 00:51:58.864
You have any idea
how big a game this is?

00:51:59.032 --> 00:52:01.742
The Hawks are a game out
of the eighth seed in the East.

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:04.370
- Don't walk out that door.
- You're speaking Mandarin.

00:52:04.538 --> 00:52:06.247
I've been planning this for months.

00:52:06.414 --> 00:52:09.333
There are plenty of mommy and daddies
who are in love with you.

00:52:09.501 --> 00:52:13.546
- Call them.
- Hey, Beth. It's Messer, from a- Yeah.

00:52:13.713 --> 00:52:17.216
Hey, I was wondering if maybe you guys
could watch Sophie for a bit today.

00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:20.344
I got a huge break.
I get to direct the Hawks game today.

00:52:20.512 --> 00:52:22.471
Nope, Amy can't.
She's got a big math test.

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:26.016
Yeah, I tried Josh and Beth too.
They're all busy. Bye-bye.

00:52:26.184 --> 00:52:28.227
Son of a...

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:33.983
It's a healthier meal
if you don't fry the shell.

00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:36.610
You know what I'm saying?
I like my taco shells baked.

00:52:36.778 --> 00:52:38.487
Yeah, I like them soft.
- Yeah.

00:52:39.114 --> 00:52:41.157
All right, thank you for the ride, Walter.

00:52:41.324 --> 00:52:44.702
Well, you called, I came.
That's how a man makes his money, baby.

00:52:44.870 --> 00:52:46.412
What's up with my floor seats?

00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.831
I'm gonna give you two floor seats.

00:52:48.999 --> 00:52:51.333
All you gotta do
is keep that meter running for me.

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:52.543
- Okay.
- My man.

00:52:52.711 --> 00:52:54.670
- We making another stop, baby?
- Yep.

00:52:54.838 --> 00:52:57.089
- Okay. All right.
- Just not yet.

00:52:57.257 --> 00:53:00.926
Not yet, not yet. The baby's in here.
You left the bab- You left the baby!

00:53:01.094 --> 00:53:04.263
You left the baby! You left the bab-
You left the baby.

00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:07.725
You left your baby.

00:53:07.893 --> 00:53:11.770
Look, Walter, please, I got no choice.
I need your help, as a friend.

00:53:11.938 --> 00:53:14.148
No, no, no.
You can't leave me with your baby.

00:53:14.316 --> 00:53:17.109
Are you on crack?
I could be the baby cab killer.

00:53:17.277 --> 00:53:18.485
I know all about you, man.

00:53:18.653 --> 00:53:21.280
I know you keep a clean cab,
you drive the speed limit...

00:53:21.448 --> 00:53:23.449
...and you got three kids
you love to death.

00:53:23.617 --> 00:53:25.409
You know why? Because they're my kids.

00:53:25.577 --> 00:53:28.662
I hate other people's kids.
That's your baby in there.

00:53:28.830 --> 00:53:30.372
Whatever the meter is, triple it.

00:53:30.540 --> 00:53:32.750
You'll be the best-paid babysitter
in the state.

00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:34.460
Please.

00:53:36.171 --> 00:53:38.839
- What if she wakes up?
- She's not gonna wake up, I pro- Oh!

00:53:39.007 --> 00:53:40.382
Look. It's her ducky.

00:53:41.551 --> 00:53:44.136
- In case of an emergency.
- Better not be no emergencies.

00:53:44.304 --> 00:53:45.679
- There won't be.
- Better not!

00:53:47.182 --> 00:53:49.433
The final seconds of this first half...

00:53:49.601 --> 00:53:52.519
Ready Camera 3. And go 3.

00:53:52.687 --> 00:53:54.355
- feeding it off, and the basket...

00:53:54.522 --> 00:53:59.318
- Simon, give me the scoring leaders, please.
- No one's ever said "please" to me before.

00:54:00.987 --> 00:54:03.614
- Who's calling?
- It's the new sitter.

00:54:03.782 --> 00:54:08.160
- Yeah?
- The baby woke up! The baby woke up.

00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:11.247
Hey, there's this great game going on.
You should check it out.

00:54:11.414 --> 00:54:14.166
Cameras 4 and 6,
4 ready by the ball, 2 by the basket.

00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:17.419
Okay, sniff her butt.
See if she needs to be changed.

00:54:17.587 --> 00:54:20.965
I'm not sniffing this baby's booty.
Man, what are you feeding this girl?

00:54:21.132 --> 00:54:25.052
It's like a dirty bomb.
It's like eggs and peanut butter.

00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:28.138
- I'll be down at halftime.
- Halftime? Are you crazy?

00:54:28.848 --> 00:54:29.848
Halftime!

00:54:30.016 --> 00:54:32.935
Okay, okay, okay, here we go, man.
Okay, okay. Oh, my God!

00:54:33.103 --> 00:54:36.438
Okay. Okay. All right.
All right, we're halfway there, Walter.

00:54:36.606 --> 00:54:38.565
- All right, here we go.
- No, no, no.

00:54:38.733 --> 00:54:40.359
No, please, listen. Walter, please.

00:54:40.527 --> 00:54:43.737
- Know what? Here. Take the whole wallet.
- I don't want your wallet.

00:54:43.905 --> 00:54:47.658
You know what I want?
I want a nice, comfy seat inside...

00:54:47.826 --> 00:54:49.326
...next to some big-screen TVs-

00:54:49.494 --> 00:54:52.204
No kids in the booth. I'm sorry.
You gotta sit out here.

00:54:52.372 --> 00:54:54.290
- Baby wanna see game?
- Baby doesn't wanna.

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:55.666
Wanna see game?

00:54:55.834 --> 00:54:57.376
Baby wanna see game.

00:55:05.677 --> 00:55:07.386
Hey, everybody.

00:55:07.554 --> 00:55:11.140
This is Sophie and her nanny, Walter.

00:55:12.892 --> 00:55:14.893
Say hi.

00:55:15.562 --> 00:55:16.770
All right, here you go.

00:55:16.938 --> 00:55:19.565
Big cushy chair, new monitors.
Drinks are in the fridge.

00:55:19.733 --> 00:55:21.317
No beer till after the game, okay?

00:55:21.484 --> 00:55:24.695
Nice. I never seen a game like this before.
Now we're talking.

00:55:24.863 --> 00:55:26.071
- So you're good?
- I'm good.

00:55:26.239 --> 00:55:27.740
All right.

00:55:28.241 --> 00:55:31.410
All right, people, second half.
Let's do this.

00:55:31.578 --> 00:55:35.039
- Did you get him through a service?
- Uh, yep.

00:55:35.206 --> 00:55:37.041
- Yeah?
- Yep.

00:55:37.208 --> 00:55:39.418
- He's your cab driver, isn't he?
- Yep.

00:55:39.586 --> 00:55:40.586
Yeah.

00:55:40.754 --> 00:55:42.921
Twenty seconds to go, Hawks down by 1.

00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:48.010
- No doubt they'll play for the last shot.
- All right, Camera 4, stay with Johnson.

00:55:48.553 --> 00:55:50.804
Liz, tell Camera 4 to stay with Johnson.
Come on.

00:55:50.972 --> 00:55:53.599
- I can barely hear you, Messer.
- A foul? Come on, man!

00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:55.225
Okay, ready Camera 6.

00:55:55.393 --> 00:55:58.312
- Walter, she's crying.
- I know, I'm trying to watch the game.

00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:01.857
- You are the worst babysitter of all time.
- Because I'm not a babysitter.

00:56:02.025 --> 00:56:04.109
Do something.
Please, I'm dying over here.

00:56:04.277 --> 00:56:07.321
All right, Camera 2, stay with Bibby-
Johnson.

00:56:07.781 --> 00:56:09.907
All right, stay with the shooter
on Camera 2-

00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:11.367
No, I mean, Camera 1.

00:56:11.534 --> 00:56:12.659
Stay on 1, 1, 1.

00:56:12.827 --> 00:56:14.661
Camera 2, stay with the- Camera 1-

00:56:14.829 --> 00:56:17.081
Alley-oop, and the Hawks win.

00:56:17.248 --> 00:56:21.710
Unbelievable play by Atlanta.
Hawks win by 1.

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:26.173
Hands down, the best game of the year.
Too bad you all couldn't see it.

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:34.431
But I'm a creep

00:56:36.976 --> 00:56:40.229
I'm a weirdo

00:56:41.606 --> 00:56:43.774
- What the hell-?
- What are you singing to her?

00:56:44.943 --> 00:56:46.527
Everybody likes Radiohead.

00:56:48.029 --> 00:56:49.321
Do you mind?

00:56:52.117 --> 00:56:54.451
What the hell am I doing here?

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:58.163
I don't belong here

00:56:59.999 --> 00:57:02.334
Mmm, mmm

00:57:02.544 --> 00:57:03.961
See?

00:57:04.129 --> 00:57:06.088
Told you it works.

00:57:14.889 --> 00:57:16.473
Would it kill you to-?

00:57:16.641 --> 00:57:18.475
- Shh.
- You shh!

00:57:18.643 --> 00:57:20.978
Would it kill you
to brighten the mood around here?

00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:22.312
- Yeah, it might.
- Come on.

00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:25.941
Why should I pretend to be happy?
I'm miserable. Let me be miserable.

00:57:26.109 --> 00:57:27.568
- It's depressing.
- I don't care.

00:57:27.735 --> 00:57:30.863
Know what? I am so sick
of all your dark little comments.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:32.197
I ruined my life for her.

00:57:32.365 --> 00:57:35.451
I'm so sorry parenting isn't as fun
as you thought it was gonna be.

00:57:35.618 --> 00:57:38.078
Yeah, you're happy
because your old life sucked.

00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:39.872
- My old life didn't suck.
- It did.

00:57:40.039 --> 00:57:42.708
My life was great.
I was my own boss, I made my own hours.

00:57:42.876 --> 00:57:44.918
- I had free time.
- To do what? Bake more?

00:57:45.086 --> 00:57:47.171
- God.
- You have no idea what a great life is.

00:57:47.338 --> 00:57:49.882
I had a great life.
I went to games for a living.

00:57:50.049 --> 00:57:52.801
Okay? Girls would buy me drinks
and throw themselves at me.

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:55.971
You see this shirt?
I slept with the girl who sold me this shirt.

00:57:56.139 --> 00:57:57.181
You're disgusting.

00:57:57.348 --> 00:58:00.225
People say you can't have it all.
I had it all. It was awesome.

00:58:00.393 --> 00:58:04.104
Of course you think that's awesome,
because all you care about is getting laid.

00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:05.898
Even Peter was embarrassed by you.

00:58:06.065 --> 00:58:10.110
He just never said anything to your face
because he was twice the man you are.

00:58:10.862 --> 00:58:12.404
You should get laid yourself.

00:58:12.572 --> 00:58:13.822
Except to have sex...

00:58:13.990 --> 00:58:16.325
...you gotta find somebody
who can stand you first.

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:20.913
Fuck you.

00:58:30.089 --> 00:58:33.175
You shouldn't ride
a motorcycle. Your kid's parents died-

00:58:33.343 --> 00:58:35.302
She is not my kid.

00:58:38.097 --> 00:58:39.348
She's not my kid.

00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:42.226
Then whose kid is she?

01:00:02.015 --> 01:00:04.850
We'll do this again. One, two-

01:00:11.399 --> 01:00:13.734
I'm sorry, Messer.

01:00:14.902 --> 01:00:17.904
- I didn't mean it.
- It's all right.

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:29.291
You know, I broke my back when I was 17.
I was almost paralyzed.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:34.004
And Pete spent that whole summer
with me in my room...

01:00:34.172 --> 01:00:36.632
...watching movies every day.

01:00:37.383 --> 01:00:41.428
All my friends went out to the beach
or went off to chase girls...

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.640
...but he just sat there with me
the whole time.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:47.851
I can't leave him alone
when he needs me.

01:00:48.561 --> 01:00:49.978
Even if he's gone.

01:00:52.523 --> 01:00:55.984
I dug up some of their old home movies
because, you know, I was just...

01:00:56.152 --> 01:01:00.739
I just wanted to hear their voices,
see them a minute, you know?

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.660
And I found this one,
and you've gotta see this.

01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:08.163
Ta-da. Ha-ha-ha.

01:01:09.248 --> 01:01:13.502
Pretty great, huh? I went with the lavender
and then the blue sky, like we talked about.

01:01:13.670 --> 01:01:17.047
- When did you paint this room?
- I did it when you were at the hospital.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:19.341
You were supposed to do it three days ago.

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:20.926
It smells like paint fumes in here.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:24.096
It's been drying for 12 hours.
- It has not been drying long enough.

01:01:24.263 --> 01:01:27.474
- You're getting so critical.
- She can't sleep in the bedroom tonight.

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:30.602
It's not even wet.
I wouldn't bring a baby into a wet room.

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:34.314
Of course it's not wet, but you
think it doesn't smell for days afterwards?

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:37.943
It doesn't. It's totally aired out.
You know how much work I put into this?

01:01:38.111 --> 01:01:42.447
You didn't do any of this.
When have you painted a cloud in your life?

01:01:42.615 --> 01:01:45.242
- I oversaw the work that was being done.
- You oversaw it?

01:01:45.410 --> 01:01:47.661
The one thing you said you would do,
you oversaw?

01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:50.914
I got creative. The guy came in,
and I said, "Let's do the clouds. "

01:01:51.082 --> 01:01:53.959
- This is ridiculous. She can't sleep here.
- Of course she can.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:56.378
- Move the crib.
- This is her room. Where else-?

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:59.172
So you're saying it's okay
that we're horrible parents...

01:01:59.340 --> 01:02:01.341
...and wanna kill each other half the time.

01:02:01.509 --> 01:02:04.010
- Two-thirds, actually.
- Yep.

01:02:04.595 --> 01:02:08.473
I think we have to just stop trying
to fit ourselves into their lives.

01:02:09.016 --> 01:02:13.145
You know, I hate this place.
It's like a mausoleum in here.

01:02:13.312 --> 01:02:16.106
You know,
there's pictures of them everywhere.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.610
And I really hate that cowboy painting.

01:02:20.778 --> 01:02:23.989
- He's really creepy, right?
- Yeah. I want it out.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:27.534
If we're gonna live here,
we have to stop tiptoeing around...

01:02:27.702 --> 01:02:31.246
...like they're coming back soon.
They're not coming back.

01:03:04.238 --> 01:03:05.530
This side has to- No.

01:03:05.698 --> 01:03:07.115
That good right there?
- No.

01:03:07.283 --> 01:03:09.493
- Looks good right there.
- Okay, like that.

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:37.979
Morning, Messer.

01:03:39.565 --> 01:03:41.399
Morning...

01:03:41.567 --> 01:03:42.567
...Jill.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:51.701
- Oh, and thank you for dinner.
- Yeah.

01:03:51.869 --> 01:03:55.956
- And next time it's my treat.
- Oh, God.

01:03:56.123 --> 01:03:59.167
Right foot, left foot. Right foot, left foot.

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.419
- Let's see some walking.
- Would you stop that?

01:04:01.587 --> 01:04:04.089
She'll walk when she's got
somewhere to go, all right?

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:07.092
All the books say she should be walking
or talking by now...

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.677
...and she's not doing either.

01:04:08.845 --> 01:04:11.930
All the books also say
that you should be married with 2.2 kids...

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:13.265
...and look at your life.

01:04:13.432 --> 01:04:16.393
That poor girl thinks
that she's going to dinner with you.

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:19.145
What's the alternative?
"Bye, I'll never see you again"?

01:04:19.313 --> 01:04:21.731
- That would be mean.
- Where do you meet these women?

01:04:21.899 --> 01:04:24.526
I mean, if you're not with me and Sophie,
you're at work.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:27.571
- I have my methods.
- Huh. Interesting.

01:04:37.290 --> 01:04:41.042
Switch it up. There we go. Oh, there it is.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:44.546
Okay. Oh, like a rubber band.

01:04:46.799 --> 01:04:50.093
- Limbering up?
- How you doing, good-looking?

01:04:50.261 --> 01:04:52.012
Oh, right back at you.

01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.222
Hey, big man.
- Hey, Ted.

01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:56.975
- Hey, you see that game last night?
- Which game?

01:05:00.229 --> 01:05:01.813
- Boo!
- Oh, my God.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:03.356
I didn't mean to scare you.

01:05:03.524 --> 01:05:05.984
- I didn't know you were a runner.
- Yep.

01:05:06.152 --> 01:05:08.486
We should train together. Yeah.

01:05:08.654 --> 01:05:12.324
- Well, I like to use this time to think.
- Oh, yeah, me too. I like to think.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:16.036
Is this the pace we're gonna keep up?
It's a little brisk.

01:05:16.954 --> 01:05:19.080
I still don't understand
all these extra costs.

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:21.666
The job's been more complicated
than we anticipated.

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.960
Oh, more complicated
than anticipated, yeah.

01:05:24.128 --> 01:05:26.796
My life has been more complicated
than anticipated.

01:05:26.964 --> 01:05:29.174
I didn't anticipate somebody
handing me a baby-

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:30.717
- Ms. Berenson?
- Yes?

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:35.430
Ah. Sorry. Hello, lady. What you doing?
Can you just give me one minute?

01:05:36.265 --> 01:05:39.601
Hey, Lonnie? Keep a better eye on her.
She's crawling around back there.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:42.062
- It's a construction site.
- A baby that crawls?

01:05:42.229 --> 01:05:44.147
- Just take her.
- I can't. Doing something.

01:05:44.315 --> 01:05:46.316
- Please.
- Can't. Big basket.

01:05:46.484 --> 01:05:49.486
- Can you help me out?
- You look beautiful with the baby, though.

01:05:49.654 --> 01:05:53.073
Doesn't she look good with-?
That's a beautiful baby. Like an accessory.

01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:54.282
Smooth.

01:05:54.450 --> 01:05:57.118
Go, Wonder Pets. Yay!

01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:00.413
Wow, that was a really good episode.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.542
What I like about Ming-Ming
is that even though they lost the game...

01:06:04.710 --> 01:06:09.339
...she really learned something valuable
about teamwork, you know?

01:06:09.507 --> 01:06:11.675
I didn't see that one coming.
How about-?

01:06:12.385 --> 01:06:14.719
Holly. Stay right- You stay right-

01:06:14.887 --> 01:06:18.556
Holly, Holly, Holly! She's standing!
She's about to walk! Get down here!

01:06:18.724 --> 01:06:21.017
- What? Now?
- Hurry up!

01:06:21.185 --> 01:06:24.729
- She can't walk now! She can't walk now!
- She's about to. Get down here.

01:06:24.897 --> 01:06:26.272
Okay, wait. Stay right there.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.983
- Wait, I'm coming.
- Hurry up!

01:06:28.150 --> 01:06:30.402
- She's walking! Hurry up!
- Stall her. I'm coming.

01:06:30.569 --> 01:06:34.656
- I'm coming! Just stall her. Stall her!
- I can't- How do you want me to stall her?

01:06:34.824 --> 01:06:37.117
- How do I stall her?
- Just stall her!

01:06:37.284 --> 01:06:39.452
Don't you take that step.
Please, don't take-

01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:42.872
- What do you want me to-?
- Ow! Oh, God, oh, God, I'm coming.

01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:46.793
- Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- Okay. What did you do?

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:50.338
You told me to stall her, so I just-
I gave her a little shove.

01:06:50.506 --> 01:06:53.717
I asked you to stall her, Messer,
not traumatize her.

01:06:53.884 --> 01:06:57.053
- Now she'll never walk.
- Okay, this is not my fault.

01:06:57.221 --> 01:07:00.682
- What did the bad man do, huh?
- Pretty sure it was your fault.

01:07:24.832 --> 01:07:28.043
Hold on. Okay, go ahead.

01:07:34.967 --> 01:07:36.968
- Are those homemade noodles?
- Yes.

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:39.429
She's the only person
who doesn't like my cooking.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.097
Now it's personal.

01:07:41.474 --> 01:07:42.599
Come on.

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.227
One bite.

01:07:47.730 --> 01:07:51.524
Oh, my God. Oh, my God, I did it!
She ate it!

01:07:51.692 --> 01:07:55.236
She ate my cooking, she ate my cooking,
she ate my cooking!

01:07:55.404 --> 01:07:56.446
I'm that good.

01:08:21.722 --> 01:08:23.932
- Oh, my God.
- What?

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.851
This is why you are always so happy
to run to the store.

01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:30.855
This is where you pick up women.
You use Sophie to get laid.

01:08:31.023 --> 01:08:33.149
She's gotta pay back somehow.
Isn't that right?

01:08:33.317 --> 01:08:36.611
- No free lunch, right, Soph?
- I wanna see it.

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:39.155
- See what?
- I wanna see you work your Messer magic.

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:41.032
You want me to pick you up? Here?

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.536
Yes. I want you to loop around
and pretend I'm one of those gym girls.

01:08:44.703 --> 01:08:46.663
I'm not gonna pretend to pick you up.

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:49.833
- I wanna get home.
- Uch. You're such a killjoy.

01:08:50.459 --> 01:08:51.918
Hey.

01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:56.881
You know what? I read about these.
They're really good for kids, but I can't-

01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:59.092
- How do you pronounce it? "Açaí"?
- "Açaí. "

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:00.552
- "Açaí"?
- Mm-hm.

01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:01.761
Oh.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:04.764
You must really have an ear
for languages, huh?

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:05.974
No, not really.

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:10.103
I took Spanish all through high school.
I did pretty well. Got good grades.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.358
Oh, you're good. You're very good.

01:09:15.526 --> 01:09:17.569
- You see that?
- I see how this works for you.

01:09:17.736 --> 01:09:19.320
Holly?

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.532
Oh! It's Sam. It's Sophie's doctor, Sam.

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.118
- Sam? You call him Sam?
- Hey, Sophie.

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:26.744
- Dr. Nelson.
- Hi. Sam.

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:29.998
- Hey, I'm Messer. Nice to meet you.
- Messer, nice to meet you too.

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.749
- Is this your...?
- No, no, no.

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:35.295
- No.
- We're not... We just...

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:36.963
Sounds complicated.

01:09:37.131 --> 01:09:38.798
- We raise Sophie together.
- Yes.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:42.302
You know, Holly's mentioned how much
she really likes Sophie's doctor...

01:09:42.469 --> 01:09:43.803
...a few times, actually.

01:09:43.971 --> 01:09:46.598
So I thought she meant
you were good with kids, but now-

01:09:46.765 --> 01:09:49.309
Can you just walk away?
Can you just give me a minute?

01:09:49.476 --> 01:09:53.229
- I'm all right here.
- Give me a minute. Thank you.

01:09:53.397 --> 01:09:56.524
Sometimes Sophie is more of a grown-up.

01:09:57.318 --> 01:09:59.527
So how's this work between you two?

01:10:00.279 --> 01:10:03.740
- You split up most of the work?
- Yes. We have charts. A very big chart.

01:10:03.908 --> 01:10:05.033
- Chart?
- Yeah.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:06.910
That chart give you any time off?

01:10:07.077 --> 01:10:09.662
Yes, Monday, Wednesday
and every other Friday.

01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:11.080
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:10:11.248 --> 01:10:14.000
- Will you have Sophie this Friday?
- No.

01:10:14.168 --> 01:10:15.835
Eight o'clock Friday?
- Great.

01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:18.129
- My office has your information?
- They sure do.

01:10:18.297 --> 01:10:20.048
- I'll call you up.
- Perfect. Okay.

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:25.136
You are so right,
this is such a great place to meet people.

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:30.975
What time does Dr. Love get here?
- Any minute. Stop calling him that.

01:10:31.143 --> 01:10:34.729
I can't believe he asked you out.
Doesn't that defy some doctor-patient thing?

01:10:34.897 --> 01:10:37.899
He's a pediatrician, so if he's dating
a patient, there'd be a problem.

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:40.610
If you have sex, is he gonna tell you
what percentile you're at?

01:10:43.822 --> 01:10:46.324
- Hi.
- Hey. Wow, you look...

01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:52.038
Oh, I'd better not say anything.
Best to keep a couple cards off the table.

01:10:52.998 --> 01:10:54.791
- Hey, Messer.
- Hey. How you doing, doc?

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:57.293
- Thanks for giving her the night off.
- All right.

01:10:57.461 --> 01:10:59.754
You know,
she tried on everything in her closet.

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:03.675
- Pretty much impossible to blow this one.
- Okay, Messer. We'll just go.

01:11:03.842 --> 01:11:06.344
- She hasn't had any for a while-
- Oh, my God, stop it.

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.221
Call me if you need me.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.351
You know, if you wanted to kill me...

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:16.688
...there were dumpsters on my side of town
that were a lot closer.

01:11:16.855 --> 01:11:18.690
You don't like to be surprised, do you?

01:11:18.857 --> 01:11:22.193
Well, I'm a little bit
of a control freak, so...

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:25.989
There we are.
- Okay. Backstage at a concert.

01:11:26.156 --> 01:11:28.283
- I'm just not that cool.
- No?

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:31.828
We're not going to Aerosmith
or Justin Bieber?

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.871
This is...

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.625
Le Mare.

01:11:37.793 --> 01:11:41.212
The owner and executive chef
has three girls, so...

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.798
- You treat Phillipe Le Mare's kids?
- I do.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.550
- Oh, my God.
Dr. Nelson.

01:11:45.718 --> 01:11:47.927
- Phillipe.
- Sam, hey. Phillipe Le Mare.

01:11:48.095 --> 01:11:50.054
- Such a pleasure.
- No, no, pleasure's mine.

01:11:50.222 --> 01:11:53.266
- Special setup right here. Come on.
So how are the beautiful girls?

01:11:53.434 --> 01:11:55.643
They're very healthy.
They have a good doctor.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:59.731
You know,
I don't do a lot of dinner dates, really.

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:00.982
What about you?

01:12:02.985 --> 01:12:04.027
No? You know what?

01:12:04.194 --> 01:12:07.363
Why don't we just relax and get
to know each other? What do you say?

01:12:07.531 --> 01:12:11.701
So you live around here?

01:12:11.869 --> 01:12:13.119
Upstairs?

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.621
I just live right around the corner
in the TV room.

01:12:15.789 --> 01:12:18.583
You know, I knew I'd seen you
somewhere around here.

01:12:19.418 --> 01:12:22.545
Excellent choice in the crushed watermelon,
by the way.

01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:24.922
I'm sorry if I'm a little nervous.

01:12:25.090 --> 01:12:27.508
It's just that I don't usually
meet babies like you.

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.594
To be honest, I...

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.263
Well, I like older women.

01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.601
Well, not that much older.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:44.942
You are getting warmer, kiddo.

01:12:48.489 --> 01:12:51.949
- I can't believe you've never come here.
- I never used to eat out much.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:55.953
My ex-wife, she would cook,
so we stayed home a lot.

01:12:56.121 --> 01:12:58.331
- You were married?
- You like how I snuck that in there?

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:00.083
Mm. Clever.

01:13:01.460 --> 01:13:03.961
- I'm so sorry. I thought I turned it off.
- That's okay.

01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:07.799
Messer, I get one night off.

01:13:07.966 --> 01:13:10.635
Look, I'm not calling for you,
I'm calling for Dr. Love.

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:12.887
Okay. All right, hold on.

01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:16.557
I'm sorry, he wants to talk to you.
It must be a Sophie question.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:18.142
Hey.

01:13:19.144 --> 01:13:20.520
It could be a couple things.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:25.691
Take her down to the ER at St. Augustus.
It's Friday, so Dr. Mooney's on call.

01:13:25.859 --> 01:13:28.486
I'll tell him you're on your way.
You won't have to wait.

01:13:28.654 --> 01:13:32.573
We'll see you there in about an hour. Okay.
Sophie's temperature spiked.

01:13:32.950 --> 01:13:34.992
They're gonna need an hour,
so I was hoping-

01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:36.786
We gotta go.

01:13:38.038 --> 01:13:40.039
Or we could go.

01:13:40.707 --> 01:13:42.834
Great. Thank you.

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:54.637
So Sophie's got a urinary-tract infection.
We're gonna put her on an antibiotic drip.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:57.306
That gets the medication
into her system a bit faster.

01:13:57.474 --> 01:14:00.685
I'll stop back by first thing in the morning
and check up on her.

01:14:01.645 --> 01:14:04.397
- Thanks.
- Thank you so much.

01:14:04.565 --> 01:14:08.109
Yeah, I was kind of looking forward
to dropping you home.

01:14:08.694 --> 01:14:12.029
I had rehearsed this whole thing
in my mind.

01:14:21.206 --> 01:14:23.916
That was even better than I rehearsed it.

01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:26.294
- I'll call you later.
- Okay.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:29.297
Thank you again.

01:14:35.012 --> 01:14:36.554
Hey, her temp's coming down.

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:38.806
Clothes, daycare, monthly food bill...

01:14:38.974 --> 01:14:41.559
...and now a $1200 bill
from the emergency room.

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.854
If something happens to the car,
one of us is gonna sell a kidney.

01:14:45.022 --> 01:14:47.231
Having a kid is expensive.
We talked about that.

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:50.610
Having kids and an expanding shop,
it's a bit much.

01:14:51.570 --> 01:14:52.904
Where'd you get the flowers?

01:14:53.071 --> 01:14:56.324
Oh. Sam sent them today.
I haven't even called him back yet.

01:14:56.492 --> 01:15:00.077
I mean, how can I? I'm a disaster.
I can't be this girl on the second date.

01:15:00.245 --> 01:15:02.830
This is what you save for marriage.
Like 10 years in.

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.999
Don't stress about the money.
We'll be fine.

01:15:05.167 --> 01:15:07.793
I'll just call Lonnie
and we'll patch up the wall...

01:15:07.961 --> 01:15:10.922
...and maybe in a few years,
we can revisit it or something.

01:15:11.089 --> 01:15:13.591
Wait, so you're gonna pull the plug
on the remodel?

01:15:13.759 --> 01:15:16.552
I can't increase the construction loan.
It's okay, you know?

01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.764
I'll just have a shop and not a restaurant.
It's fine.

01:15:19.932 --> 01:15:21.766
It'll be okay.

01:15:26.230 --> 01:15:28.648
You know, I can give you the money.

01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:33.611
- I have savings.
- No. No, I can't let you do that.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:35.821
- I would never take your savings.
- I want to.

01:15:35.989 --> 01:15:38.658
We're raising a kid together.
We have this house together.

01:15:38.825 --> 01:15:40.159
This is just part of it.

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:43.663
Look, having somebody help you
doesn't mean that you failed.

01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:46.541
It just means that you're not in it alone.

01:15:47.668 --> 01:15:49.126
Um...

01:15:50.170 --> 01:15:53.548
Okay, but it can't be a gift.
I won't take it unless it's an investment.

01:15:53.715 --> 01:15:55.716
Fine. I'm an investor in Fraiche.

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:56.968
You're...

01:15:57.135 --> 01:15:58.928
You're an investor in "Fraiche. "

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:00.638
- "Fraiche. " Sorry.
- "Fraiche. "

01:16:00.806 --> 01:16:02.848
That entitles you to 2 percent of profits.

01:16:03.016 --> 01:16:04.183
- Three percent.
- Two.

01:16:04.351 --> 01:16:06.936
And, hey, a discount on food and wine.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:08.437
- Discount?
- Ten percent.

01:16:08.605 --> 01:16:10.856
- Fifteen percent.
- Ten percent.

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:12.441
It's a great discount.

01:16:14.152 --> 01:16:16.153
- Then you throw in dinner.
- Oh, deal.

01:16:16.321 --> 01:16:17.738
- All right.
- Awesome. Okay.

01:16:17.906 --> 01:16:20.866
Oh, my God. Thank you so much.
That's huge.

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:24.328
Okay, dinner, tonight, on me.
You and me.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:31.711
Hello.

01:16:32.254 --> 01:16:34.505
- You look so pretty.
- Oh, thank you.

01:16:37.426 --> 01:16:39.302
Oh, my God.

01:16:40.178 --> 01:16:41.554
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:16:41.722 --> 01:16:44.432
So here are all the numbers.

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:47.977
My cell phone, his cell phone,
the restaurant and the pediatrician.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:49.562
Yep.

01:16:50.147 --> 01:16:53.774
You know you actually have to
leave the house for me to do my job?

01:16:53.942 --> 01:16:54.984
- Yeah.
- Yes.

01:16:55.152 --> 01:16:57.278
- Okay. All right.
- Okay. All right.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:17:00.448
- Okay, have fun.
Bye-bye. Bye-bye.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.890
This place is amazing, Holly.
I can't believe I haven't been here before.

01:17:26.391 --> 01:17:29.602
Look at you. You're a kitchen ninja.

01:17:30.354 --> 01:17:33.397
- You don't follow any kind of a recipe?
- No.

01:17:33.565 --> 01:17:37.568
This is the only place in life
where I do not follow a plan.

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:43.783
You got under five minutes. No.

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.619
I was technically awake.

01:17:52.709 --> 01:17:55.628
- Are you sure you wanna do this?
- A bet's a bet. I can do this.

01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:58.422
- You don't have to.
- You know what I'm not sure about?

01:17:58.590 --> 01:18:01.759
The helmet. It's lame.
I want something with thunderbolts on it.

01:18:01.927 --> 01:18:03.511
We're gonna pull out the choke.

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:04.720
- The what?
- The choke.

01:18:04.888 --> 01:18:05.930
- Okay.
- All right?

01:18:06.098 --> 01:18:09.725
Turn on the ignition, pull in the clutch.
Here. Hold that in. Hold that in.

01:18:09.893 --> 01:18:12.228
- Okay.
- Push the starter button.

01:18:12.396 --> 01:18:13.437
All right, there we go.

01:18:13.605 --> 01:18:16.524
All right, left hand is the clutch,
right hand is the throttle.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:19.068
- Okay.
- All right, let's get your kickstand up.

01:18:19.236 --> 01:18:20.778
Oh, I'm on a freaking motorcycle!

01:18:20.946 --> 01:18:24.115
Easy there, Rain Man. We're not done?
Now we're in first gear.

01:18:24.282 --> 01:18:25.366
- Okay.
- Hold that.

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:28.369
- Don't let go of that clutch till I get on-
- Let go?

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:31.455
- Oh, my God.
- No.

01:18:34.209 --> 01:18:37.878
Oh, my God. Oh, Messer.
Oh, Messer, I'm so sorry.

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:40.464
- No, it's okay. Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:43.509
Oh!

01:18:46.179 --> 01:18:47.930
Oh, no.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:51.267
Oh, no. Are you mad?

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.686
No, I'm just- I'm gonna sit down.

01:18:54.479 --> 01:18:56.272
I thought you said, "Let go. "

01:18:56.440 --> 01:19:00.651
Do you want me to go talk
to the bus driver maybe?

01:19:06.491 --> 01:19:08.826
- God, I am so sorry, Messer.
- Don't worry about it.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:11.537
- I'm gonna pay for it, I promise.
- I'm actually in awe.

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:14.498
You didn't even drive it a foot
before you destroyed it.

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:18.836
- I feel so bad. I'm really sorry.
- It's fine. Okay?

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.796
It's just a bike.

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:23.174
Do you mean that,
or are you just saying that...

01:19:23.341 --> 01:19:26.010
...because you think if I keep talking,
you're gonna cry?

01:19:26.178 --> 01:19:27.845
Get inside.

01:19:29.806 --> 01:19:31.348
- Hi.
Hi.

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:35.978
I didn't wanna move her.

01:19:36.354 --> 01:19:37.938
That's okay.

01:19:39.858 --> 01:19:42.109
Amy, wait a second.

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:45.196
Here you go. Now, come on, no backsies.

01:19:45.781 --> 01:19:48.616
- Thanks, Amy.
- Thank you. Bye-bye. Have a good night.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:53.245
I think you guys
make a really cute couple.

01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:01.420
She said the same thing about Taylor Swift
and that Twilight kid.

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:55.975
Oh, my God, we're in their room.

01:20:56.893 --> 01:20:57.935
It's not so scary.

01:20:58.103 --> 01:20:59.770
- This room is beautiful.
- Yeah.

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:02.231
- How come we haven't used it at all?
- I have no idea.

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:04.024
What thread count are these sheets? Ooh!

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:08.487
You think they planned this?

01:21:08.655 --> 01:21:10.322
What?

01:21:10.490 --> 01:21:13.659
Us? No. No.

01:21:13.827 --> 01:21:17.288
They tried that once before.
We know how that worked out.

01:21:18.623 --> 01:21:21.208
Well, I kind of get it now.

01:21:21.376 --> 01:21:23.544
What, why they set us up?

01:21:23.712 --> 01:21:27.089
Yeah, I never understood it before,
but now that I know you better...

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:29.800
...I can see what Alison was thinking.

01:21:30.385 --> 01:21:31.969
You have a lot in common with her.

01:21:32.137 --> 01:21:34.138
- With Alison?
- Yeah.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:38.475
You'd think it would be Peter,
but it's her you remind me more of.

01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:46.650
She was just so fun and easygoing,
you know?

01:21:53.158 --> 01:21:55.326
- I have a surprise.
- What?

01:21:56.202 --> 01:21:59.747
- Something I found earlier.
- What?

01:22:02.500 --> 01:22:04.710
- A little contraband.
- Oh, my God, no.

01:22:04.878 --> 01:22:06.503
- What do you mean, no?
- We can't.

01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:08.964
- Sophie is asleep in the next room.
- She's asleep.

01:22:09.132 --> 01:22:10.758
Come on,
it'll help us stave off glaucoma.

01:22:13.970 --> 01:22:15.179
- No.
- Come on.

01:22:15.347 --> 01:22:18.057
No. Absolutely not.

01:22:18.224 --> 01:22:21.185
We cannot smoke that.

01:22:29.986 --> 01:22:31.445
Don't.

01:22:42.916 --> 01:22:45.209
- Why are you leaving them?
- I'm just taking a few.

01:22:45.377 --> 01:22:46.961
We're not gonna eat all these.

01:22:47.128 --> 01:22:50.172
All right. Come on, let's go.
What are we watching?

01:22:52.842 --> 01:22:54.218
Jump in the car

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:56.428
And buckle up

01:22:56.972 --> 01:22:59.556
You know there was five Wiggles
originally?

01:22:59.724 --> 01:23:00.891
I was the fifth Wiggle.

01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:02.184
Jump in the car

01:23:02.602 --> 01:23:04.478
Put on my seat belt

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:07.231
And we can ride the whole day long

01:23:07.399 --> 01:23:10.609
- Oh! That's neat. How do you do that?
- Like a wiggle.

01:23:10.777 --> 01:23:13.487
- Am I doing it? Am I doing it?
- That's good.

01:23:19.160 --> 01:23:22.997
This is inappropriate for children.

01:23:23.164 --> 01:23:26.792
MEN
The shining moon sees no sunlight

01:23:27.127 --> 01:23:30.254
The sun sees no moonbeams

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:34.717
- So the moon and the sun are friends?
- They're best friends.

01:23:34.884 --> 01:23:38.429
They're in each other's dreams

01:23:57.407 --> 01:23:59.283
What? Who?

01:24:01.786 --> 01:24:03.328
- Hello?
- That's the baby monitor.

01:24:03.496 --> 01:24:04.997
Oh, where's the phone?

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.332
- I think it's the door.
- I'll get the door.

01:24:09.377 --> 01:24:12.713
Oh, good morning, Mr. Messer.
I hope this isn't too inconvenient a time.

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:16.467
No, no, no, this is perfect.
Just give us one minute.

01:24:16.634 --> 01:24:19.053
Actually, it's rather warm outside.
I'd love to-

01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.637
Yay, yay, yay!

01:24:20.805 --> 01:24:22.848
- Hey, Janine is here.
- What? Now?

01:24:23.016 --> 01:24:25.476
- God, that lady has the worst timing.
- Come on.

01:24:25.643 --> 01:24:28.353
You take Sophie.
I'll clean upstairs, you clean downstairs.

01:24:28.521 --> 01:24:30.731
- And get the illicit drugs.
- Okay.

01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:59.343
Okay, okay, okay. We didn't smoke it.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:01.678
- I got a little carried away.
- You ready? Okay.

01:25:01.846 --> 01:25:03.347
- Where's Sophie?
- Where's Sophie?

01:25:03.515 --> 01:25:04.515
So-?

01:25:07.268 --> 01:25:10.646
There we go. All right, there we go.

01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:13.065
Well, you seem more settled in your roles.

01:25:13.233 --> 01:25:14.942
Yeah, yeah. We have learned a lot.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.861
And so has Miss Sophie.
She's walking now.

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:21.115
So how are you two getting along?
Is there any tension?

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.908
- Us?
- Why would there be tension?

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:26.203
- Everything's fantastic.
- Everything's all good, good, good.

01:25:26.371 --> 01:25:29.039
Have you thought
about how you're gonna make this work...

01:25:29.207 --> 01:25:31.041
...or what your plans might be together?

01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:34.044
We hadn't really gotten that far.
It's still pretty new.

01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:38.465
And some things just happened
with no plan at all.

01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:41.343
Really?
Because I kind of had a plan in mind.

01:25:41.511 --> 01:25:45.347
Really? It just never occurred to me
that you had any interest in my plans.

01:25:45.515 --> 01:25:47.766
How could you not know
I wanted to plan with you?

01:25:47.934 --> 01:25:50.060
Maybe I'm not as experienced a planner
as you.

01:25:50.228 --> 01:25:53.689
- I think you're a good planner.
- Oh, come on, people, you had sex.

01:25:56.025 --> 01:25:57.067
Huh?

01:25:57.235 --> 01:26:01.655
We have no intention of letting our personal
lives affect our parenting, I promise.

01:26:01.823 --> 01:26:03.824
- You gonna get married?
Ha, ha.

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:08.078
- This happened, what, six hours ago?
- That's a little specific. I don't know if she-

01:26:08.246 --> 01:26:11.248
What if it doesn't work out?
Are you gonna sleep in the garage?

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:15.627
Sex in this situation, it's like termites.
It makes for a very unstable household.

01:26:16.421 --> 01:26:19.923
You were supposed to be my easy case.
I got a nice coffee on the way here.

01:26:20.091 --> 01:26:24.011
I thought, "Gonna deal with my easy case,
gonna make it like a little vacation. Yay!"

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:25.929
- Look, Janine, it-
Now, oh, my God.

01:26:26.097 --> 01:26:29.683
We have one more meeting scheduled.
Before then, work out your personal issues.

01:26:29.851 --> 01:26:32.978
Whether you decide to get engaged
or pretend it never happened...

01:26:33.146 --> 01:26:34.438
...I don't care.

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:37.524
Just work your shit out, okay?

01:26:37.692 --> 01:26:39.067
- Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay.

01:26:41.738 --> 01:26:45.490
- Do you mind if I snag a brownie?
- Oh, God, no. No, no, no.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.160
Oh, really, I'm so sorry.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:50.662
It's a bad batch,
and I'm a professional baker.

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:54.416
No, it's okay. Your house, your food.
Anyway, so I'm sorry. I'm out of here.

01:26:54.584 --> 01:26:55.792
- Thank you.
I'm sorry.

01:26:55.960 --> 01:26:57.753
- Are you-?
- It's okay. Thank you.

01:27:01.883 --> 01:27:04.134
You're my last single friend.

01:27:04.302 --> 01:27:06.303
Without you,
I have no link to the outside.

01:27:06.471 --> 01:27:10.349
Look, I don't know why we did it.
We just... We just did.

01:27:10.516 --> 01:27:14.519
Do you know what marriage is like?
Imagine a prison.

01:27:14.687 --> 01:27:17.105
- And then don't change anything.
- We're not married.

01:27:17.273 --> 01:27:21.193
You guys are raising a kid together.
That's the most married you can get.

01:27:21.361 --> 01:27:22.861
Messer.

01:27:23.029 --> 01:27:25.239
- Minute?
- Oh, yeah.

01:27:27.575 --> 01:27:30.327
So I gave you a nice big fat break.

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:32.246
That didn't go so well.

01:27:32.413 --> 01:27:35.624
Should I learn my lesson with you,
or should I give you another shot?

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:38.919
Given a choice,
I'd go with that one, the shot.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.213
You get it better
than just about anybody here.

01:27:41.381 --> 01:27:43.715
Sports isn't just about stats
and memorizing plays.

01:27:43.883 --> 01:27:46.009
It's about insight, it's about feeling.

01:27:46.177 --> 01:27:48.595
You got the talent,
but you are all over the place.

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:50.055
I can be in one place, Alan.

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:51.723
- Can you?
- Yeah.

01:27:51.891 --> 01:27:53.100
Can you be in Phoenix?

01:27:54.018 --> 01:27:55.852
A spot opened up directing for the Suns.

01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.689
They called,
asked who I thought was right for the job.

01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:00.440
I'd like to tell them you.

01:28:03.027 --> 01:28:04.611
Let me know.

01:28:13.204 --> 01:28:15.289
JOSH
Every time I think of you

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:20.043
I always catch my breath

01:28:21.587 --> 01:28:25.799
And I'm still standing here
And you're miles away

01:28:25.967 --> 01:28:28.218
Somebody's getting along pretty good.

01:28:28.386 --> 01:28:30.887
Mmm. Two cats in heat.

01:28:31.055 --> 01:28:33.348
Ooh. Look at her. Frisky kitty.

01:28:33.516 --> 01:28:36.977
That's too casual.
I'll tell you this, they totally did it.

01:28:37.145 --> 01:28:39.313
I don't think so. I honestly don't think so.

01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.482
She bet me $400 that they were gonna
sleep together by Labor Day.

01:28:42.650 --> 01:28:46.153
- That's why you're saying that.
- I feel like I'm watching CSI: Relationship.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:50.574
If me at any age of my life could see me,
he would kick my cat ass, you know that?

01:28:50.742 --> 01:28:54.161
Uh-oh. Messer owes you a quarter, he does.
He said a bad word.

01:28:54.329 --> 01:28:57.414
Messer. I heard you lived around here.

01:28:57.582 --> 01:28:58.790
Ben, hey.

01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:02.044
Sweet move, landing Phoenix.
We're gonna miss you around the arena.

01:29:02.211 --> 01:29:05.714
- We're still talking about that.
- Alan said it seemed like a done deal.

01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:08.425
We're gonna be over at the band in a bit.
Meet you there.

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:09.843
Nice whiskers.

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:14.014
What was that about?

01:29:14.807 --> 01:29:17.100
Nothing. Come on, let's go, let's go.

01:29:17.268 --> 01:29:19.770
- Come on. Okay.
- Thank you.

01:29:20.897 --> 01:29:22.230
Come on, Messer, out with it.

01:29:22.398 --> 01:29:25.067
It's just something Alan and I talked about
the other day.

01:29:25.234 --> 01:29:28.153
He put me up for a directing job. It's...

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:29.738
- In Phoenix.
- For the Suns.

01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:33.700
- Running their whole crew for the season.
- You said no, though, right?

01:29:33.868 --> 01:29:37.287
Well, I didn't wanna be rude
and just turn it down right on the spot.

01:29:37.455 --> 01:29:40.040
- So why didn't you tell me about it?
- Because I didn't-

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:43.627
I don't know, I didn't want it to be a thing.
It's not like I can take it.

01:29:43.795 --> 01:29:46.129
- But you want to.
- Well, of course I want to.

01:29:46.297 --> 01:29:49.341
- It's a huge opportunity.
- So you're thinking about it.

01:29:50.343 --> 01:29:52.010
- No.
- No?

01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:53.804
No, I'm not thinking about it.

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:57.724
I don't understand
why you didn't just mention it to me.

01:29:57.892 --> 01:30:01.311
Because I didn't want you to get upset,
which you obviously are.

01:30:01.479 --> 01:30:03.980
Why would I be upset
if it's not even a possibility?

01:30:04.148 --> 01:30:07.401
Know what, Mess? Can you just stop
with the food for one minute?

01:30:07.568 --> 01:30:10.987
Can you just tell me honestly,
are you thinking about taking this job?

01:30:13.324 --> 01:30:15.826
Yeah. I'm thinking about it.

01:30:15.993 --> 01:30:18.328
This is something
that I've been working for, okay?

01:30:18.496 --> 01:30:21.331
I would've jumped
at this opportunity before.

01:30:21.499 --> 01:30:22.791
Before Sophie and before me?

01:30:24.752 --> 01:30:26.670
I get it. Come on. Come here, bugaboo.

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:29.005
- Holly. Holl-
- Hey, bugaboos. Hello, bugaboos.

01:30:29.173 --> 01:30:30.632
How was this gonna work exactly?

01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:33.135
Were we gonna go with you,
or were you gonna leave?

01:30:33.302 --> 01:30:35.679
I don't know.
I never had to think for three people.

01:30:35.847 --> 01:30:38.557
I barely had to think for one.
It's just a job offer, okay?

01:30:38.724 --> 01:30:42.018
No, it's not, it's exactly what
you've been waiting for, a clean out.

01:30:42.186 --> 01:30:44.604
- That's not true.
- You have never wanted to be here.

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:47.732
And after everything,
you still think of us as temporary.

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:49.359
You think that I'm not in this?

01:30:49.527 --> 01:30:52.737
I gave up my place,
I gave up my motorcycle, I gave you money.

01:30:52.905 --> 01:30:55.699
- I never asked you for money.
- I did it to make you happy.

01:30:55.867 --> 01:30:58.285
I gave up everything
to play this frigging part.

01:30:58.911 --> 01:31:01.079
"Play this part"?

01:31:01.664 --> 01:31:02.914
That's what this is to you.

01:31:03.082 --> 01:31:05.792
Well, we're living in their house,
we're raising their kid.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.503
We're acting like we're married,
but we're not.

01:31:08.671 --> 01:31:12.257
- Have you been pretending with Sophie?
- No, I love Sophie.

01:31:12.925 --> 01:31:13.967
So just me, then.

01:31:16.762 --> 01:31:19.055
You should take the job, Messer.

01:31:28.274 --> 01:31:31.568
I know. I'm sorry.

01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:37.949
I'm sorry.

01:32:21.827 --> 01:32:24.496
I'm coming, Soph.
I'm coming, honey, hold on.

01:32:25.331 --> 01:32:26.790
Okay.

01:32:28.626 --> 01:32:29.626
Oh.

01:32:29.794 --> 01:32:33.171
I knew you'd be up to your eyeballs
in egg whites, so I just grabbed her.

01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:34.381
- Thanks.
- There you go.

01:32:35.258 --> 01:32:39.135
Good morning, Miss Soph. I missed you.

01:32:39.303 --> 01:32:42.138
You slept so good last night.
Can you say "apple"?

01:32:42.306 --> 01:32:43.473
Apple.

01:32:43.641 --> 01:32:45.016
Banana.

01:32:45.184 --> 01:32:47.852
I always sound like Antonio Banderas
when I do that.

01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:50.605
Banana.

01:32:50.773 --> 01:32:52.274
All right.

01:32:52.441 --> 01:32:55.694
I'd love to sit and eat,
but I got the Finister twins coming in...

01:32:55.861 --> 01:33:00.323
...and if I'm even a minute late, they will
redecorate my waiting room, again.

01:33:01.158 --> 01:33:03.201
- I'll see you later?
- Mm-hm.

01:33:03.369 --> 01:33:05.412
Wait, take a muffin.

01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.998
Thanks. Bye, Sophie.

01:33:08.833 --> 01:33:10.208
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:25.890
And the Phoenix Suns' Steve Nash to a...

01:33:26.058 --> 01:33:29.352
Greg, ready that cutaway. Roll it.

01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:30.520
Take it.

01:33:35.359 --> 01:33:36.526
Weirdo

01:33:38.321 --> 01:33:40.530
What the hell am I doing here?

01:34:05.222 --> 01:34:06.848
Thank you.

01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:16.775
- Thanks.
Oh, look.

01:34:17.652 --> 01:34:18.860
Wow.

01:34:19.070 --> 01:34:23.031
Oh, look at you.
My goodness, you're getting so big.

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:26.409
- She's huge, right?
- That iChat doesn't do her justice.

01:34:26.577 --> 01:34:29.454
- "Messer. " Can you say "Messer"?
- Oh, good luck with that.

01:34:29.622 --> 01:34:31.498
- Still no "Holly," huh?
- Nope.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:35.627
You know what it's like to be outranked
by "cup," "pool," and "giraffe"?

01:34:35.795 --> 01:34:39.422
Okay, so we are all set for Monday.

01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:42.175
Janine actually broke tradition
and scheduled something.

01:34:42.551 --> 01:34:46.096
So you really did kill the expansion, huh?
That's too bad.

01:34:46.263 --> 01:34:49.974
Yeah, we were like this before
and we were fine, so...

01:34:50.768 --> 01:34:52.727
All right, you ready?

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:54.729
See you.

01:34:54.897 --> 01:34:56.606
- Have fun.
- Okay.

01:34:58.401 --> 01:35:00.402
- Hey, Mess?
- Yeah?

01:35:00.569 --> 01:35:02.821
I don't know
if you have any plans or not...

01:35:02.988 --> 01:35:05.782
...but, well, Sam and I
are hosting a Thanksgiving dinner...

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:07.826
...and the neighbors are gonna be there.

01:35:07.993 --> 01:35:11.287
They keep asking about you,
so I don't know, maybe you wanna join us.

01:35:11.455 --> 01:35:12.539
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:13.998
- Yeah, what the hell.
- Okay.

01:35:14.166 --> 01:35:15.625
- All right. You're cooking?
- Yes.

01:35:15.793 --> 01:35:17.794
- All right. I'll see you there.
- Great.

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:19.254
Say goodbye. There we go.

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:29.806
- Mmm.
- You think?

01:35:29.974 --> 01:35:32.308
You don't think it needs more nutmeg?

01:35:34.812 --> 01:35:35.895
You are no help.

01:35:37.273 --> 01:35:38.481
I'll get it.

01:35:42.653 --> 01:35:44.738
Whoa, settle down.

01:35:45.656 --> 01:35:46.698
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:35:46.866 --> 01:35:48.992
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Yeah, you too.

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:50.744
- I got you a little wine.
- Thanks.

01:35:50.911 --> 01:35:52.495
- Nine bucks.
- Wow.

01:35:54.623 --> 01:35:56.416
- Where's Soph?
- She's back there.

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:58.460
- Okay.
- Come on in.

01:35:59.587 --> 01:36:00.920
- Oh, hey.
- Hi. Hello.

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:02.839
- Hi.
Hey, sport.

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:04.799
- That was a wave to me.
- Okay.

01:36:04.967 --> 01:36:06.926
So, what else you maniacs been up to?

01:36:07.094 --> 01:36:09.179
Gary and I are taking
a couples' karate class.

01:36:09.513 --> 01:36:10.805
- Wow.
Fun.

01:36:10.973 --> 01:36:13.349
I'm not gonna be around to defend him
all the time.

01:36:13.517 --> 01:36:15.018
- Toughen him up.
- Yeah.

01:36:15.186 --> 01:36:19.647
What a great opportunity to get to kick
your spouse in the face once in a while...

01:36:19.815 --> 01:36:23.276
...in a controlled setting
where it's okay and it's expected.

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:24.986
Messer.

01:36:25.154 --> 01:36:28.448
- Hey. How you doing, doc?
- Good, good.

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:31.034
- Glad you could make it.
- Appreciate that.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:35.622
Although, technically, this is my house,
so I'm glad you could make it.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:39.042
You know, I know this is a little weird.

01:36:39.210 --> 01:36:42.337
- No, it's not weird.
- It's a little weird.

01:36:42.505 --> 01:36:44.923
The house, we're all a part of it,
especially you.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:47.926
Yeah, we're all fans of the house.

01:36:48.093 --> 01:36:51.095
Hey, dinner today is a great way
for us to say goodbye, right?

01:36:51.597 --> 01:36:52.680
Absolutely.

01:36:54.683 --> 01:36:57.310
I'm sorry, am I missing something?

01:37:00.523 --> 01:37:02.607
You're selling the house?

01:37:03.400 --> 01:37:06.611
- When were you gonna tell me about this?
- After our meeting with CPS.

01:37:06.779 --> 01:37:09.781
It's just too big, Messer.
The upkeep's a fortune. You know that.

01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:13.368
- I'm paying my half.
- I appreciate that, but it's still not enough.

01:37:13.536 --> 01:37:14.911
You should've asked me, Holly.

01:37:15.079 --> 01:37:17.539
Oh, like you asked me
about moving to Phoenix?

01:37:17.706 --> 01:37:20.583
You're not selling the house.
They wanted her to grow up here.

01:37:20.751 --> 01:37:24.754
They wanted you and I to raise her,
but you walked away from that obligation.

01:37:24.922 --> 01:37:27.382
You sure didn't waste any time
finding somebody else.

01:37:27.550 --> 01:37:30.677
Are you gonna try to make me feel bad
because you walked away?

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:33.930
You wanted to do it on your own,
but you never could've without me.

01:37:34.098 --> 01:37:37.141
That's why seconds after I was gone,
you found Replacement Messer.

01:37:37.309 --> 01:37:38.726
He is not Replacement Messer.

01:37:38.894 --> 01:37:41.771
Sound really travels in here,
don't you think?

01:37:41.939 --> 01:37:46.526
You know what? He is nothing like you.
Sam is nothing like you.

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:50.697
He is warm and kind, and he doesn't
run away at the first sign of something real.

01:37:50.865 --> 01:37:52.115
Yeah, I ran.

01:37:52.283 --> 01:37:55.076
My best friend died,
and overnight I had a house and a baby.

01:37:55.244 --> 01:37:57.078
- I'm sorry if-
- If what?

01:37:57.246 --> 01:37:59.289
- I was scared.
- You don't think I was scared?

01:37:59.456 --> 01:38:03.001
It was easier for you. You wanted this.
You wanted the life that they had.

01:38:03.168 --> 01:38:06.170
But not the way I got it.
Jesus, not the way I got it.

01:38:06.338 --> 01:38:08.631
And not with somebody
who didn't love me back.

01:38:08.799 --> 01:38:10.466
But I did.

01:38:12.636 --> 01:38:14.345
Holly, I still do.

01:38:19.476 --> 01:38:21.394
No, you're right.

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:22.937
We were just...

01:38:23.105 --> 01:38:26.274
We were just pretending to be them.

01:38:27.484 --> 01:38:29.611
We needed each other
to get through everything.

01:38:29.778 --> 01:38:34.282
And now that's done, and we don't need
to pretend anymore, Messer, okay?

01:38:34.450 --> 01:38:36.534
I don't wanna fight with you, please.

01:38:42.958 --> 01:38:44.709
I'm gonna go back to Phoenix.

01:38:45.377 --> 01:38:47.295
You can handle Janine on your own.

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:50.506
Looks like you got things covered here
without me.

01:38:56.513 --> 01:38:58.097
Oh, damn it.

01:39:02.186 --> 01:39:04.687
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

01:39:04.855 --> 01:39:06.439
It was great to see you all.

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:09.817
If you're ever in Phoenix,
don't be afraid to look me up.

01:39:16.992 --> 01:39:18.576
Shh, shh, shh.

01:39:33.300 --> 01:39:37.345
Okay, dinner is served.

01:39:37.805 --> 01:39:40.556
You guys all should try the stuffing.
Really, it's amazing.

01:39:40.724 --> 01:39:44.352
There's an andouille-sausage thing
going on, so you'll love it.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.605
Go ahead and dig in.
Come on, everybody, just...

01:39:48.148 --> 01:39:50.191
Eat, now.

01:39:59.159 --> 01:40:02.412
All right, thanks for coming.
Good night, sweetie.

01:40:10.587 --> 01:40:12.088
Yeah, okay, that was bad.

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:17.969
Yeah, maybe we did go too fast.

01:40:18.137 --> 01:40:20.096
You have unresolved feelings for him.

01:40:20.264 --> 01:40:23.057
Messer and I barely got along
under the best circumstances...

01:40:23.225 --> 01:40:25.727
...and there weren't very many
of those either.

01:40:26.437 --> 01:40:29.022
If my wife and I fought like that...

01:40:31.108 --> 01:40:33.151
...well, we'd still be married.

01:40:39.825 --> 01:40:43.119
You know, before anything happened
to Peter and Alison...

01:40:43.287 --> 01:40:46.664
...you were exactly the guy
I wanted to be with.

01:40:47.416 --> 01:40:51.377
I would lose time thinking about you,
and I didn't even know your name yet.

01:40:58.302 --> 01:40:59.343
I'll miss you guys.

01:41:09.855 --> 01:41:13.983
"Leonardo was a terrible monster.

01:41:15.778 --> 01:41:18.279
He couldn't scare anyone.

01:41:20.657 --> 01:41:23.034
He didn't have 1642-"

01:41:23.202 --> 01:41:24.994
Mama.

01:41:26.330 --> 01:41:28.790
No, Holly.

01:41:28.957 --> 01:41:32.043
- No, I'm Holly.
- Mama.

01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:50.728
Yeah, baby girl.

01:41:51.688 --> 01:41:53.397
I'm your mama.

01:42:03.200 --> 01:42:07.120
The truth is, you know,
sometimes it works better...

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:09.580
...with one person doing everything,
you know?

01:42:09.748 --> 01:42:12.458
No charts, no arguments.

01:42:14.044 --> 01:42:15.545
I know it's not ideal.

01:42:15.712 --> 01:42:18.714
But since when do parents
get the ideal, right?

01:42:20.175 --> 01:42:24.929
Right? Right, pretty girl? Huh?
I know, I know.

01:42:30.519 --> 01:42:32.395
I'm sorry.

01:42:32.563 --> 01:42:34.814
I can't do this. This isn't right.

01:42:35.482 --> 01:42:37.650
- Is there a problem?
- Yeah, I'm an idiot.

01:42:37.818 --> 01:42:40.570
I gotta reschedule.
I'm sorry. I need to get to the airport.

01:42:40.737 --> 01:42:42.572
- Come on.
- What?

01:42:59.965 --> 01:43:03.176
All right, come on.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

01:43:03.343 --> 01:43:05.178
MESSER
Hey, this is Messer.

01:43:05.345 --> 01:43:07.263
- Ugh!
- Leave me something dirty.

01:43:09.349 --> 01:43:11.267
You know,
I could have come back for you.

01:43:11.768 --> 01:43:15.062
Well, this is our last meeting,
and I'm booked up for the next month.

01:43:15.230 --> 01:43:18.441
- One way or another, we're finishing it.
- Okay.

01:43:18.942 --> 01:43:22.486
If you wanna get there quickly, you might
wanna drive faster than other cars.

01:43:22.654 --> 01:43:24.363
But you're observing me, so...

01:43:24.781 --> 01:43:27.992
- I'm observing you miss the flight. Move it.
- Okay.

01:43:50.641 --> 01:43:52.183
Come here.

01:43:54.645 --> 01:43:59.523
July 22nd, 2010. First steps.

01:44:01.902 --> 01:44:04.070
Where you going? Come back.

01:44:06.198 --> 01:44:07.490
Yay!

01:44:12.037 --> 01:44:14.789
You have a beautiful family.

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:17.750
Thank you.

01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:20.294
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:44:20.462 --> 01:44:22.880
...Flight 722 to Phoenix
will now begin boarding.

01:44:31.515 --> 01:44:35.101
Hi. Hi. I need two tickets that will get me
anywhere near Terminal T...

01:44:35.269 --> 01:44:39.605
- ... as fast as possible, please.
- Three. I'm not waiting in the car.

01:44:41.149 --> 01:44:43.150
The baby's shoes too, ma'am.

01:44:44.194 --> 01:44:46.529
Are you kidding me? They're baby shoes.

01:44:47.072 --> 01:44:50.616
- Just give her to me. Give her to me. Go.
- Here. Okay, thanks.

01:45:44.963 --> 01:45:48.257
It's just, you ran all the way there...

01:45:48.425 --> 01:45:51.969
...and I thought when I took Sophie,
it would be, you know, okay.

01:45:52.137 --> 01:45:54.930
I know.
You know, you did great, you did.

01:45:55.098 --> 01:45:57.558
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine, I will.

01:45:58.143 --> 01:46:00.061
- I've got Sophie.
- Yeah.

01:46:00.228 --> 01:46:02.980
And maybe this is the way
things were meant to be, so-

01:46:03.148 --> 01:46:05.524
You're just gonna be so unhappy.

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:09.445
- I'm not gonna start crying again.
- I should get Sophie inside.

01:46:09.613 --> 01:46:12.031
Yeah, sure.

01:46:16.203 --> 01:46:19.288
- You're gonna be a great mom.
- Thanks.

01:46:21.124 --> 01:46:23.959
- I'll let CPS know you passed.
- Thank you. Thanks.

01:46:24.669 --> 01:46:26.629
- Chin up.
- Okay.

01:46:26.797 --> 01:46:28.255
I'm really sorry that I cried.

01:46:28.423 --> 01:46:30.758
- No problem. Used to crying.
- Okay.

01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:41.310
Okay.

01:46:42.145 --> 01:46:43.479
Here.

01:46:43.647 --> 01:46:47.608
Wanna play with the keys?
Just don't lose them like last time.

01:46:56.576 --> 01:47:01.122
- Oh, my God. Messer. Oh, my God.
- I didn't mean to scare you, all right?

01:47:01.289 --> 01:47:04.291
I had my key, and I thought
that you'd be home for Janine.

01:47:05.335 --> 01:47:06.377
Messer-

01:47:06.545 --> 01:47:09.130
Look, please don't say anything.
Just listen.

01:47:10.382 --> 01:47:12.842
I finally figured out
why Peter and Alison picked us.

01:47:13.009 --> 01:47:14.844
And it's not because we knew them best.

01:47:15.011 --> 01:47:17.555
It's because you and me together,
with Sophie...

01:47:17.722 --> 01:47:20.599
...somehow, we're a family.

01:47:22.185 --> 01:47:24.687
Like they were.
And that's why they picked us.

01:47:24.855 --> 01:47:27.940
And when I'm gone,
I don't just miss her or you, I miss us.

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:29.984
I miss our family.

01:47:30.152 --> 01:47:31.402
I know we got it backwards.

01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:35.030
You're supposed to meet, fall in love,
then have a baby, but I don't care.

01:47:35.198 --> 01:47:38.075
I don't care how it happened,
because I fell in love with you.

01:47:38.535 --> 01:47:40.369
- I fell in love with our family.
- Messer.

01:47:43.373 --> 01:47:45.291
I was at the airport.

01:47:48.378 --> 01:47:51.630
Did you plan some kind of a trip
that I'm not aware of?

01:47:52.215 --> 01:47:53.591
No.

01:47:56.386 --> 01:48:00.306
Well, did you hear me say I loved you?
Because I can say it again.

01:48:00.474 --> 01:48:02.057
Okay.

01:48:03.643 --> 01:48:05.561
I love you.

01:48:27.417 --> 01:48:31.629
When I found out that I was pregnant again,
I just cried and I cried and I cried.

01:48:31.796 --> 01:48:34.215
And I said, "Scott, can we be this blessed?
Can we?"

01:48:34.382 --> 01:48:36.509
We can't repeat what I said.
It was not polite.

01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:40.429
We cannot. We were- You know what?
I think Campbell needs a new diaper.

01:48:40.597 --> 01:48:41.847
- Okay.
- Thank you.

01:48:42.015 --> 01:48:43.057
- Me, huh?
- Yeah.

01:48:43.225 --> 01:48:45.392
- All right.
- Look at him go.

01:48:45.560 --> 01:48:49.063
Oh, Scott, could you get me maybe
a little glass of ice water or something?

01:48:49.231 --> 01:48:52.066
- Of course. Why haven't I done that?
Oh, I don't know.

01:48:52.234 --> 01:48:54.026
Coming through.

01:48:54.194 --> 01:48:56.737
- Hey. Cookie?
- Uh-oh. I don't know what's more delicious.

01:48:56.905 --> 01:48:59.698
- Oh, no, thanks. Trying to cut back.
- Okay.

01:48:59.866 --> 01:49:02.535
Give me that back.
I'll take one of these. Mostly raisins.

01:49:02.702 --> 01:49:04.787
- It's like a salad.
Yeah. It's a great salad.

01:49:04.955 --> 01:49:08.707
It's all about the sleep schedule, man.
You've gotta put those babies to sleep.

01:49:08.875 --> 01:49:11.460
Hey, Sophie has a request for the caterer.

01:49:11.628 --> 01:49:13.003
- Cake.
- Yeah.

01:49:13.171 --> 01:49:14.588
Cake? Do you like cake?

01:49:16.216 --> 01:49:18.551
It's simple, it's understated, it's...

01:49:18.718 --> 01:49:21.178
Yeah, you know me. That's how I roll.
Simple, understated.

01:49:25.016 --> 01:49:27.560
- Ah. Okay, okay.
- Ah. Yes.

01:49:27.727 --> 01:49:31.647
- You're never gonna get any easier, are you?
- Nope. And I have another one.

01:49:32.774 --> 01:49:35.693
What? She's 2.
- It's for us, because we made it a year.

01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:40.990
Okay, babe.

01:49:41.491 --> 01:49:42.491
- All right.
- Ready?

01:49:42.659 --> 01:49:45.703
- Here we go, Soph. Alrighty.
- Here we go.

01:49:45.870 --> 01:49:48.747
Here we go.
We're going to the birthday party.

01:49:48.957 --> 01:49:52.001
Happy birthday to you

01:49:52.586 --> 01:49:55.754
Happy birthday to you

01:49:56.339 --> 01:50:00.342
Happy birthday, dear Sophie

01:50:00.802 --> 01:50:04.471
Happy birthday to you
