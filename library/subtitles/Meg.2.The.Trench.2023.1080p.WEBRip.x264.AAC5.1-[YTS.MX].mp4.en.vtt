12
00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.761
- It's highly toxic.

13
00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.721
Come on, lads, keep it moving.

14
00:03:41.721 --> 00:03:43.098
Keep it moving.

15
00:03:45.851 --> 00:03:47.436
Go, go, go!

16
00:03:48.895 --> 00:03:50.355
Is this double pay or what?

17
00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.523
There is toxic waste.

18
00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.781
What are you doing
sitting there, mate?

19
00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:01.450
- You're almost there.

20
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.660
I want this filth off my ship
as fast as possible.

21
00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.765
What you doing, then?

22
00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.477
Naughty.

23
00:04:29.394 --> 00:04:31.146
Help! Help!

24
00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.273
Naughty.

25
00:04:33.273 --> 00:04:34.691
Shh.

26
00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.109
- Keep your little beak shut.

27
00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:37.402
Not very nice.

28
00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:38.862
Otherwise,
you'll go for a swim.

29
00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.281
- Help! Help!

30
00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:43.825
Help me! Help me!

31
00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:46.411
- Hey.
- Ah. Well done.

32
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.829
I'm here from the home office.

33
00:04:47.829 --> 00:04:49.206
Bullshit.

34
00:04:49.206 --> 00:04:51.750
Here checking on,
uh, security protocols...

35
00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.920
...and, um, taking
a few pictures, so smile.

36
00:04:56.505 --> 00:04:58.215
What are you doing in here?

37
00:04:58.215 --> 00:04:59.633
- Not very nice.
- What's going on?

38
00:05:04.387 --> 00:05:05.847
That's him!

39
00:05:05.847 --> 00:05:06.848
- I'll get you!

40
00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.650
Hey, hey!
Get at this!

41
00:05:33.792 --> 00:05:35.085
- Get up.
- Get Him down!

42
00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.756
You two, go left!
Cut him off!

43
00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.716
I want him caught,
dead or dead.

44
00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:47.222
Not there!
Go around! Go around!

45
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:52.102
There you go, mate.
End of the line.

46
00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.021
Okay.

47
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:57.107
You're all under arrest.

48
00:05:57.107 --> 00:05:58.567
- Huh?
- For the illegal dumping

49
00:05:58.567 --> 00:06:00.151
- of radioactive materials.

50
00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:04.239
Yeah, you, you,
you, you and you.

51
00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:07.284
What, me and...
and him, and him? And him?

52
00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.121
- Kill him.
- Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

53
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:14.291
I know.
You want to see the warrant.

54
00:06:14.291 --> 00:06:15.750
It's right in my pocket.

55
00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:18.795
I'll see you in court, yeah?

56
00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:26.261
We're out of shipping lanes,

57
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.138
and you're 200 miles
from shore.

58
00:06:28.138 --> 00:06:29.806
So enjoy your swim.

59
00:06:35.353 --> 00:06:37.022
I've got him.
Just off the port side.

60
00:06:39.858 --> 00:06:41.359
He's like a green James Bond.
I like it.

61
00:06:45.363 --> 00:06:46.698
Oh, no, my hat!

62
00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:49.159
Hello, suckers.

63
00:06:49.159 --> 00:06:50.702
Looks like
he's been making friends.

64
00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.246
Wherever he goes,
people just love him.

65
00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:54.456
God knows why.

66
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.754
Do you got this?

67
00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.089
We'll see.

68
00:07:04.966 --> 00:07:07.010
Maybe this wasn't
the best idea.

69
00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:09.304
Maybe this isn't
the best idea.

70
00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.514
This is gonna be awesome.

71
00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:12.849
Define "awesome."

72
00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.309
I'm about to.

73
00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:16.728
Opening hatch.

74
00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.371
Next time, put a little
more air in this thing.

75
00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:35.914
It's like breathing
through a straw.

76
00:07:35.914 --> 00:07:37.540
Worked, didn't it?

77
00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.209
You okay?

78
00:07:39.209 --> 00:07:40.627
If you love your job,

79
00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.295
you'll never work a day
in your life.

80
00:07:47.425 --> 00:07:50.470
Okay,
bring in Test 15.

81
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.138
Initiating suit power-up.

82
00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:53.223
Clear.

83
00:07:56.101 --> 00:07:57.143
Promising.

84
00:08:02.107 --> 00:08:03.733
The exo suit
is performing way beyond

85
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:04.943
what we expected, Jiuming.

86
00:08:09.322 --> 00:08:10.782
21% increase in power.

87
00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:13.910
Not bad, huh?

88
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.994
So cool.

89
00:08:18.915 --> 00:08:21.000
I can't wait to use these
in the trench.

90
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.755
Hi.

91
00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.090
What's up favourite niece?

92
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.133
I'm supposed
to tell you not to be

93
00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.551
late for the party tonight.

94
00:08:29.551 --> 00:08:31.970
Of course.

95
00:08:34.472 --> 00:08:36.516
- Maybe 25. Hmm?
- Okay.

96
00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.768
I mean it,
don't be late!

97
00:08:48.403 --> 00:08:50.029
I cannot believe
you got this far in life

98
00:08:50.029 --> 00:08:51.948
without knowing
how to tie a tie.

99
00:08:51.948 --> 00:08:54.826
First, let's not overstate
how far I've gotten in life.

100
00:08:54.826 --> 00:08:58.288
Second, never involved wearing
a monkey suit.

101
00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.956
- Perfect. You look great.
- Thanks.

102
00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:02.459
Ah. Maybe this is the start
of something.

103
00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.753
Don't count on it.

104
00:09:08.673 --> 00:09:09.466
Hi.

105
00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.055
That guy look familiar
to you?

106
00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:16.931
No.

107
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:21.311
- I don't like him.
- You don't like anyone.

108
00:09:21.311 --> 00:09:22.812
I like you.

109
00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:24.481
That's 'cause I save
your life all the time...

110
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.774
I buy you beers
and I back you up

111
00:09:25.774 --> 00:09:27.108
in bar fights.

112
00:09:27.108 --> 00:09:28.985
It's 'cause
you're a special guy.

113
00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.820
You're both special.

114
00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:33.448
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

115
00:09:33.448 --> 00:09:34.616
Thanks for the money.

116
00:09:34.616 --> 00:09:36.034
Ladies and gentlemen,

117
00:09:36.034 --> 00:09:37.660
welcome to
the 10th anniversary

118
00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.454
of the Oceanic Institute.

119
00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:41.247
I'm Hilary Driscoll.

120
00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:44.209
Thank you for coming tonight,
and for joining me

121
00:09:44.209 --> 00:09:47.712
in funding
this incredible work.

122
00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:50.256
Stop. Don't fidget.

123
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.509
Why exactly do I have to be

124
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:54.219
up here anyway?

125
00:09:54.219 --> 00:09:55.720
'Cause you're a team player.

126
00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.014
Great.

127
00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.601
Please give a warm welcome

128
00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:03.812
to the director
of the Institute...

129
00:10:04.938 --> 00:10:06.606
...Zhang Jiuming.

130
00:10:10.443 --> 00:10:11.569
Thank you, Hilary.

131
00:10:15.323 --> 00:10:19.077
As the great
poet Song Lian said...

132
00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:22.247
"Man is limited
only by his imagination."

133
00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:27.252
My father named me Jiuming,

134
00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:30.004
which means ocean

135
00:10:30.004 --> 00:10:31.589
or abyss.

136
00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:35.927
My father and my sister

137
00:10:35.927 --> 00:10:38.054
spent their lives
studying the ocean.

138
00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:40.682
It wasn't until

139
00:10:40.682 --> 00:10:42.767
they were both gone
that I began to wonder

140
00:10:42.767 --> 00:10:45.603
what my purpose was.

141
00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:47.564
But through Suyin's daughter Meiying,

142
00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:49.315
I saw that there was a future.

143
00:10:50.859 --> 00:10:52.569
I merged
my father's research institute

144
00:10:52.569 --> 00:10:54.654
with my company

145
00:10:55.989 --> 00:10:57.699
to carry forward

146
00:10:57.699 --> 00:11:00.827
the spirit of exploring
the unknown in their honor.

147
00:11:05.665 --> 00:11:07.292
To mark
this tenth anniversary,

148
00:11:07.292 --> 00:11:10.712
I want to introduce you all
to someone very special.

149
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:20.263
Her name is Haiqi.

150
00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:22.640
She is the world's
only megalodon in captivity.

151
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:25.685
We found her injured as a pup.

152
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.395
Thanks to Haiqi, we've learned
a tremendous amount

153
00:11:27.395 --> 00:11:28.855
about the megalodons

154
00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.858
as well as the trench
where they live.

155
00:11:31.858 --> 00:11:33.902
Thanks
to the generous donations

156
00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.737
from our supporters,

157
00:11:35.737 --> 00:11:38.072
we have been able
to create the technology

158
00:11:38.072 --> 00:11:40.074
to pass through
the thermocline,

159
00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.952
a thermal layer
of freezing cold water

160
00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.830
that separates Haiqi's world
from ours

161
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.918
and into a trench 6,000 meters
below sea level.

162
00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.045
Thanks to you,
we have the ability

163
00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:54.005
to go further
than ever before.

164
00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:58.009
Love the ocean
and protect the ocean.

165
00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:59.093
Thank you

166
00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:04.557
And thank you. Zhang Jiuming.

167
00:12:04.557 --> 00:12:06.476
So, thank you all

168
00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:11.022
for being part of protecting
this incredible ecosystem.

169
00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:13.524
Thank you for coming.

170
00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:16.152
Do you think
there are more creatures

171
00:12:16.152 --> 00:12:17.111
to be discovered down there?

172
00:12:17.862 --> 00:12:19.322
There has to be.

173
00:12:19.322 --> 00:12:20.782
Who wants to get a selfie

174
00:12:20.782 --> 00:12:22.533
with the man

175
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.827
who fought a megalodon
and lived to tell the tale?

176
00:12:24.827 --> 00:12:26.537
We give you,
ladies and gentlemen,

177
00:12:26.537 --> 00:12:28.373
Jonas Taylor.

178
00:12:28.373 --> 00:12:30.291
- There he is! There he is.

179
00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:35.254
I know this was your idea.

180
00:12:35.254 --> 00:12:37.423
- I'm gonna kill you.

181
00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.175
Smile and pretend you love it.

182
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.344
Go on, give him a hug.
Give him a tickle.

183
00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.347
Oh, he loves people.

184
00:12:56.192 --> 00:12:58.611
I wanna go
to Mana One with you.

185
00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.988
I want to dive the trench.

186
00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:02.156
No.

187
00:13:03.324 --> 00:13:04.283
Sorry, Meiying.

188
00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:06.536
Why not?

189
00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:09.497
Mom was diving all the time
at my age.

190
00:13:09.497 --> 00:13:11.457
Not to 25,000 feet.

191
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.752
Saying it's too dangerous?

192
00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:15.878
Too dangerous for you.

193
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:19.424
But not dangerous.

194
00:13:19.424 --> 00:13:22.760
In psychology, they call
that "cognitive dissonance."

195
00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.639
In the real world,
they call it "parenting."

196
00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:28.141
You need to start
taking me seriously

197
00:13:28.141 --> 00:13:29.434
as a scientist.

198
00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:32.145
- You're 14.
- Exactly.

199
00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.188
I know every system
on Mana One,

200
00:13:34.188 --> 00:13:35.940
every dive protocol

201
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.734
and every animal
we've seen down there.

202
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.903
Hey, look.

203
00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.321
You can come to Mana One.

204
00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:44.949
To observe the dive.

205
00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:47.869
And that's it.

206
00:13:50.079 --> 00:13:51.247
Jiuming is swimming
with the meg.

207
00:13:52.749 --> 00:13:53.750
Uncle.

208
00:13:55.168 --> 00:13:56.794
Haiqi's vitals
are elevated.

209
00:13:56.794 --> 00:13:59.213
Be careful,
she's definitely aware of you.

210
00:14:03.051 --> 00:14:04.552
Why are you swimming

211
00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:05.887
with the meg, Jiuming?

212
00:14:05.887 --> 00:14:08.139
I'm conducting an experiment.

213
00:14:08.139 --> 00:14:10.016
Is the experiment
"Do I taste good?"

214
00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.020
Uncle, are you crazy?

215
00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:15.730
It's okay.

216
00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:17.690
I've been training Haiqi
since she was a pup.

217
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.443
A meg is not trainable, Jiuming.

218
00:14:20.443 --> 00:14:22.320
But if you wanna be eaten

219
00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.864
in front of your niece,
go ahead.

220
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.116
Fifty bucks says
this is gonna end badly.

221
00:14:27.116 --> 00:14:28.618
I'll take that action.

222
00:14:28.618 --> 00:14:30.411
I am all in
for team shark.

223
00:14:30.411 --> 00:14:32.997
What? You can't bet
on a shark, man.

224
00:14:32.997 --> 00:14:34.332
That's bad karma.

225
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:36.375
Come on, guys, focus.
That's not cool.

226
00:14:36.375 --> 00:14:38.211
Jiuming...

227
00:14:38.211 --> 00:14:39.587
I'd like
to respectfully suggest

228
00:14:39.587 --> 00:14:41.255
that this is truly
a terrible idea.

229
00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:43.633
Megs and humanity
were never meant to mix.

230
00:14:45.093 --> 00:14:47.512
Haiqi and I
have a special bond.

231
00:14:47.512 --> 00:14:48.930
Watch this.

232
00:14:51.015 --> 00:14:53.810
One click to come.
Two clicks to go.

233
00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:26.717
Whoa.
I think she's looking at us.

234
00:15:34.934 --> 00:15:37.270
You see?

235
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:40.606
She's coming around.
Heart rate is up.

236
00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:42.650
- Moving in fast.

237
00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:48.406
Four hundred meters.

238
00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.540
Slowly, slowly.

239
00:16:00.042 --> 00:16:01.502
Jiuming,
she's not responding.

240
00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:02.587
Come on, Haiqi.

241
00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:03.629
Two hundred meters.

242
00:16:06.924 --> 00:16:08.384
- One hundred meters.

243
00:16:08.384 --> 00:16:09.760
Jiuming, move.

244
00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.637
It's too late.
She's coming in too fast.

245
00:16:11.637 --> 00:16:13.097
Fifty meters.

246
00:16:14.015 --> 00:16:15.683
Pull the cord.

247
00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:17.143
Twenty meters.

248
00:16:17.143 --> 00:16:18.644
Jiuming,
get out of there!

249
00:16:18.644 --> 00:16:19.854
- Uncle, no!

250
00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:26.736
Did it get him?

251
00:16:26.736 --> 00:16:28.487
I don't know.
I couldn't watch.

252
00:16:29.363 --> 00:16:30.489
I don't see him.

253
00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.784
I knew this was a bad idea.

254
00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:40.833
Total success.

255
00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.213
Uncle! Are you crazy?

256
00:16:45.213 --> 00:16:46.464
It's all right,
I'm good.

257
00:16:46.464 --> 00:16:48.090
Huh?

258
00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.009
That was exciting, huh?

259
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.347
I can't figure out
what's wrong with her.

260
00:16:54.347 --> 00:16:56.599
She's been acting strangely
all week.

261
00:16:56.599 --> 00:16:59.185
You can clickety-click
all you want.

262
00:16:59.185 --> 00:17:01.103
The problem is
that it's a meg.

263
00:17:01.103 --> 00:17:02.480
And you're a snack.

264
00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:04.065
- Yeah.

265
00:17:04.065 --> 00:17:07.193
For the record, you scared
the hell out of Meiying.

266
00:17:07.193 --> 00:17:08.569
You're one to talk.

267
00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:10.488
What were you doing
on that ship?

268
00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:13.532
Actually, don't tell me.
I don't wanna know.

269
00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:15.826
Well, the Institute's mandate

270
00:17:15.826 --> 00:17:18.287
is to protect the oceans, right?

271
00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:21.749
We can't be a part
of any illegal activity.

272
00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.209
Oh, I abhor lawlessness.

273
00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:24.919
Oh, good.

274
00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:26.754
Especially the illegal dumping
of radioactive waste.

275
00:17:28.214 --> 00:17:30.716
You're taking
bigger and bigger risks

276
00:17:30.716 --> 00:17:32.051
each time you go out.

277
00:17:32.051 --> 00:17:34.011
Well, I guess
we both know about that.

278
00:17:35.429 --> 00:17:37.098
It's not the same.

279
00:17:37.098 --> 00:17:38.474
With me,

280
00:17:38.474 --> 00:17:40.226
there's a calculation
of risks.

281
00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.021
Not that I see.

282
00:17:56.867 --> 00:17:58.911
Do you miss your mom,
big fish?

283
00:18:01.497 --> 00:18:03.874
- Doctor Howard.

284
00:18:03.874 --> 00:18:05.501
Are you ready for Mana One?

285
00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:09.797
Yes, whenever you're ready?

286
00:18:09.797 --> 00:18:13.134
These new suits will let us
travel anywhere and at
any depth underwater.

287
00:18:14.218 --> 00:18:15.219
Say.

288
00:18:17.555 --> 00:18:18.973
- What?

289
00:18:18.973 --> 00:18:20.641
No worries, no worries.

290
00:18:27.690 --> 00:18:29.692
Mom and Grandpa
talked about you all the time.

291
00:18:31.569 --> 00:18:33.029
Nothing good I suppose.

292
00:18:34.113 --> 00:18:35.072
Wanna guess?

293
00:18:38.242 --> 00:18:40.494
See this scar?

294
00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:43.706
When I was 11
my father was busy in the lab.

295
00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:46.500
So I snuck out to swim with my
friends on the rocky shores...

296
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.378
and had to get nine stitches
as a result of it.

297
00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:51.213
When I returned home my father
taught me a real lesson.

298
00:18:53.007 --> 00:18:53.841
Grandpa?

299
00:18:53.841 --> 00:18:55.676
Of course.

300
00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.553
He was kind to you
because you're
his granddaughter,

301
00:18:57.553 --> 00:19:00.598
but he was tough on me.

302
00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:05.728
So after college,
I started a company.

303
00:19:05.728 --> 00:19:09.190
I wanted to get away from him.

304
00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:12.693
I hadn't had any contact
with your grandfather
for many years.

305
00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:16.280
Then he asked your mum
to bring me this calligraphy.

306
00:19:16.280 --> 00:19:19.116
"Dragon travelling
across the Four Seas."

307
00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:21.952
I thought it was
a form of ridicule...

308
00:19:21.952 --> 00:19:26.665
but I came to realize that
he wanted me to
find my own way.

309
00:19:29.919 --> 00:19:31.504
Like the dragon...

310
00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:34.799
I hope you can find
your own fate.

311
00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:36.842
Ground crew,
we're approaching Mana One.

312
00:19:36.842 --> 00:19:39.178
Hey,
Rigas. Good to have you back.

313
00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.930
I missed you guys.

314
00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:41.680
Are you ready
to do some diving?

315
00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:43.724
You know it.

316
00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.456
Morning, everyone.

317
00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:49.915
Let's get this show underwater.

318
00:20:49.915 --> 00:20:50.875
Dive 1 and Dive 2,

319
00:20:50.875 --> 00:20:52.293
descend to 25,000 feet.

320
00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.211
We're exploring Area 19.

321
00:20:54.211 --> 00:20:56.380
Collecting rock samples
and logging any new species.

322
00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.716
Diving in T-minus 20 minutes.

323
00:20:58.716 --> 00:21:00.509
All eyes open

324
00:21:00.509 --> 00:21:02.511
for a straightforward
sweep and scan. The usual.

325
00:21:02.511 --> 00:21:04.597
Yeah.
There's no usual down there.

326
00:21:04.597 --> 00:21:06.891
- System's up.

327
00:21:08.809 --> 00:21:10.060
What's with
all these toys you have

328
00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.562
hanging around your console,
Lance?

329
00:21:12.855 --> 00:21:14.982
They're not toys,
they're figurines.

330
00:21:14.982 --> 00:21:17.401
They are
definitely toys, Lance.

331
00:21:17.401 --> 00:21:18.486
- Thank you.

332
00:21:25.618 --> 00:21:26.744
Ready for the drop, guys?

333
00:21:50.184 --> 00:21:53.312
So, are you and Sal, like,
Comic-Con guys or what?

334
00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.690
Uh, absolutely right. Yeah.

335
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:59.068
Do you, um, dress up?

336
00:21:59.068 --> 00:22:00.694
Uh, yeah.

337
00:22:00.694 --> 00:22:02.446
Don't get him started,
unless you want to see

338
00:22:02.446 --> 00:22:03.864
a million photographs.

339
00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:05.908
Oh, yes, please.

340
00:22:05.908 --> 00:22:07.451
Stay focused, guys.

341
00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:11.747
Passing 17,000.

342
00:22:11.747 --> 00:22:13.415
Telemetry's good.

343
00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:19.338
It's a beautiful day
in the neighborhood.

344
00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:26.387
Passing 18,000 feet.

345
00:22:26.387 --> 00:22:28.889
All systems nominal.

346
00:22:28.889 --> 00:22:30.474
Looking good, team.

347
00:22:30.474 --> 00:22:31.642
Let's pull up the grids
we're gonna map today.

348
00:22:31.642 --> 00:22:33.435
Area 19.

349
00:22:33.435 --> 00:22:35.062
When are we going to
look at something different?

350
00:22:35.062 --> 00:22:36.021
You know,
there's like 100 more

351
00:22:36.021 --> 00:22:37.314
sectors to explore.

352
00:22:37.314 --> 00:22:39.567
Jonas,
can you confirm O2 levels?

353
00:22:39.567 --> 00:22:42.653
Consumption is 11%
over mission spec.

354
00:22:42.653 --> 00:22:45.114
Guess Rigas is nervous.

355
00:22:45.114 --> 00:22:46.907
More like
you're a mouth breather.

356
00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:48.450
- He totally is.

357
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:49.618
Can feel the breeze
from over here.

358
00:22:49.618 --> 00:22:51.036
Yeah.

359
00:22:51.036 --> 00:22:53.998
Firstly, it's called
a deviated septum.

360
00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:56.750
Second, I distinctly remember
deviating it

361
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.210
while saving
your ungrateful ass

362
00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:00.921
from a 70-foot megalodon.

363
00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:04.216
Passing 20,000 feet.
Approaching the thermocline.

364
00:23:07.636 --> 00:23:09.597
Checking O2 lines
and tank pressure.

365
00:23:09.597 --> 00:23:11.056
Well,
if there was a leak,

366
00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.224
there would be
a fluctuation on the readings.

367
00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:14.101
I'm not seeing anything here.

368
00:23:14.101 --> 00:23:15.811
Check the pressure
on the auxiliary O2 tanks.

369
00:23:15.811 --> 00:23:17.771
Okay, I'll check again.

370
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:20.107
That's not the problem.

371
00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:21.734
Uh, Jonas?

372
00:23:23.902 --> 00:23:25.779
Meiying?

373
00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:27.072
What the hell are you doing?

374
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:28.157
You gotta be kidding me.

375
00:23:30.951 --> 00:23:32.745
I see that you're angry.

376
00:23:32.745 --> 00:23:34.788
But I believe
that this is a reasonable

377
00:23:34.788 --> 00:23:36.290
and responsible decision.

378
00:23:36.290 --> 00:23:37.416
Stop the dive.

379
00:23:39.084 --> 00:23:40.794
Full stop.

380
00:23:40.794 --> 00:23:43.797
But before you start yelling,
can I just say...

381
00:23:43.797 --> 00:23:45.257
I did all kinds
of stupid things

382
00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:47.009
when I was 14.

383
00:23:47.009 --> 00:23:48.844
And look how I turned out.

384
00:23:48.844 --> 00:23:50.346
We're surfacing.

385
00:23:50.346 --> 00:23:51.889
But I don't see
what the problem is.

386
00:23:51.889 --> 00:23:54.308
This is your 26th trench dive
without incident.

387
00:23:54.308 --> 00:23:56.185
Subs have electric
predator countermeasures,

388
00:23:56.185 --> 00:23:57.603
and emergency dive suits.

389
00:23:57.603 --> 00:23:58.979
Which you don't have.

390
00:23:58.979 --> 00:23:59.980
Actually...

391
00:24:01.899 --> 00:24:04.276
I packed one while you were
doing the pre-dive meeting.

392
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:05.611
You know,

393
00:24:05.611 --> 00:24:07.363
now's maybe
a good time to, uh,

394
00:24:07.363 --> 00:24:10.866
sit down
and be quiet for a minute.

395
00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:12.451
I can do a seatbelt by myself,
you know.

396
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.619
I know you can.

397
00:24:13.619 --> 00:24:14.662
Jonas.

398
00:24:15.704 --> 00:24:17.081
It's not your call, Jiuming.

399
00:24:17.081 --> 00:24:18.290
We've got company.

400
00:24:19.708 --> 00:24:21.377
Guys, it's a meg.

401
00:24:21.377 --> 00:24:22.670
- Approaching fast.

402
00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:24.004
That's not possible.

403
00:24:24.004 --> 00:24:25.631
they can't go through
the thermocline.

404
00:24:25.631 --> 00:24:26.924
It's not come
from the thermocline.

405
00:24:26.924 --> 00:24:28.217
I'm tracking it
from the shore.

406
00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:32.012
Dive! Flank speed!

407
00:24:32.012 --> 00:24:35.099
Engaging.
Rerouting battery array.

408
00:24:35.099 --> 00:24:36.183
Hold on.

409
00:24:38.394 --> 00:24:40.104
Charging
the predator countermeasures.

410
00:24:40.104 --> 00:24:42.272
We'll be dead
before they're online.

411
00:24:42.272 --> 00:24:44.400
Thermocline's our only hope.

412
00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.943
I'm reading Haiqi's tracker.

413
00:24:47.569 --> 00:24:49.613
Impossible.

414
00:24:49.613 --> 00:24:51.240
Well,
impossible just got possible.

415
00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:52.866
Five hundred meters
to the thermocline.

416
00:24:52.866 --> 00:24:54.827
Haiqi's closing fast.

417
00:24:54.827 --> 00:24:56.078
One hundred meters.

418
00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:57.121
She's right above us.

419
00:24:59.331 --> 00:25:00.916
Come on, come on!

420
00:25:00.916 --> 00:25:02.876
Entering the thermocline.

421
00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:04.294
Dive 1, Dive 2.

422
00:25:04.294 --> 00:25:05.921
Switch to low-frequency light.

423
00:25:05.921 --> 00:25:07.506
you don't want to attract
any more megs.

424
00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:08.674
I've lost her.

425
00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:10.092
She can't follow us through.

426
00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:11.468
Can she?

427
00:25:11.468 --> 00:25:13.220
Going dark.

428
00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.222
I've never crossed
the thermocline at 60 knots.

429
00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.810
Careful. You don't want
to burn out the engines.

430
00:25:19.810 --> 00:25:22.396
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
break the pretty toys.

431
00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:32.698
Yes.

432
00:25:36.577 --> 00:25:37.870
She's still on us.

433
00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:39.079
Thirty seconds

434
00:25:39.079 --> 00:25:41.331
- for the countermeasures.
- Evasive.

435
00:25:41.331 --> 00:25:42.624
She must have followed
our heat signature.

436
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:03.812
How did your pet shark

437
00:26:03.812 --> 00:26:05.230
get down here, Jiuming?

438
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:06.815
She must have escaped.

439
00:26:06.815 --> 00:26:08.650
How did that happen?

440
00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:10.110
Predator countermeasures active.

441
00:26:11.862 --> 00:26:13.280
Proximity alert.

442
00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:14.406
Megs.

443
00:26:17.534 --> 00:26:19.328
No way.

444
00:26:29.713 --> 00:26:33.175
That's the biggest meg
I've ever seen.

445
00:26:33.175 --> 00:26:35.969
Biggest meg
anyone's ever seen.

446
00:26:35.969 --> 00:26:37.763
That's gotta be
the apex predator.

447
00:26:42.017 --> 00:26:44.770
Incredible. Megs are solitary.

448
00:26:44.770 --> 00:26:46.271
It's like
they're being called.

449
00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.775
I'm changing the dive plan.

450
00:26:49.775 --> 00:26:51.485
We have to see
what they're up to.

451
00:26:51.485 --> 00:26:53.403
And what about Meiying?

452
00:26:53.403 --> 00:26:54.780
Well, I vote we go.

453
00:26:55.739 --> 00:26:57.908
I wasn't asking you.

454
00:26:57.908 --> 00:26:59.910
Oxygen
reserves are at maximum.

455
00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:02.746
Predator countermeasures
are deployed.

456
00:27:02.746 --> 00:27:04.790
Right now
we are perfectly safe.

457
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:07.626
Right now, yeah.

458
00:27:07.626 --> 00:27:10.462
If I see anything dangerous,
I'm pulling the plug.

459
00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:11.672
Mac, we're changing

460
00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:12.965
the mission profile.

461
00:27:12.965 --> 00:27:15.342
Proceeding on heading 227.

462
00:27:15.342 --> 00:27:16.593
Now, they're already
off mission.

463
00:27:16.593 --> 00:27:17.928
They need to stay on course.

464
00:27:17.928 --> 00:27:19.263
Jonas,
you're going way outside

465
00:27:19.263 --> 00:27:21.098
the sector we have
already mapped.

466
00:27:21.098 --> 00:27:22.474
This is
an exploration mission.

467
00:27:22.474 --> 00:27:23.892
Let's explore.

468
00:27:24.893 --> 00:27:26.144
Copy that.

469
00:27:26.144 --> 00:27:27.229
- Eyes open, watch your backs.

470
00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:28.689
Really, Mac?

471
00:27:28.689 --> 00:27:30.858
So, we're gonna follow
some giant sharks

472
00:27:30.858 --> 00:27:32.943
to a unknown sector?

473
00:27:32.943 --> 00:27:34.987
Man...

474
00:27:34.987 --> 00:27:37.155
This some dumbass shit,
mark my words.

475
00:27:41.702 --> 00:27:43.912
Entering sector 21.

476
00:28:00.846 --> 00:28:03.056
Commencing geographical scan.

477
00:28:04.933 --> 00:28:06.059
It's so beautiful.

478
00:28:08.312 --> 00:28:10.355
Your mum loved this place
more than anything.

479
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:13.609
I'm glad
I finally get to see it.

480
00:28:15.903 --> 00:28:17.738
Don't get used to it.

481
00:28:17.738 --> 00:28:19.656
You're grounded
for the rest of your life.

482
00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:22.743
I love you, too.

483
00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.414
Haiqi
400 meters ahead and holding.

484
00:28:27.414 --> 00:28:28.916
Where are we going now?

485
00:28:28.916 --> 00:28:30.584
Into the unknown.

486
00:28:30.584 --> 00:28:33.378
That's what we came for.

487
00:28:33.378 --> 00:28:35.130
I've got
Haiqi's tracker ahead.

488
00:28:35.130 --> 00:28:36.840
Looks like she's circling.

489
00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:50.312
Look up.

490
00:28:50.312 --> 00:28:52.522
It's some
instinctual gathering.

491
00:28:52.522 --> 00:28:53.899
Incredible.

492
00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:57.694
They're here to mate.

493
00:28:57.694 --> 00:29:00.489
This is why Haiqi has been
acting strangely.

494
00:29:00.489 --> 00:29:02.950
Oh, great.
More megs.

495
00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:11.833
The scanner's detecting
an abnormal structure.

496
00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.468
No way.

497
00:29:21.468 --> 00:29:23.136
Is that a wreck?

498
00:29:26.431 --> 00:29:28.767
It's some kind of
sea floor station.

499
00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:30.394
What could they be
doing down here?

500
00:29:34.648 --> 00:29:36.024
Rigas, run all spectrums.

501
00:29:37.651 --> 00:29:39.111
No, that's no wreck.

502
00:29:39.111 --> 00:29:41.530
I'm getting
heat signatures off it.

503
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.073
Just can't see what's inside.

504
00:29:43.073 --> 00:29:44.449
Multiple airlocks,

505
00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.784
power generation.

506
00:29:45.784 --> 00:29:48.203
The resources needed
is staggering.

507
00:29:50.247 --> 00:29:52.624
Who would even have
that technology?

508
00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:56.253
Sonar says
there's something above us.

509
00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:58.380
It looks like a submarine.

510
00:29:58.380 --> 00:30:00.090
Let's take a look.

511
00:30:00.090 --> 00:30:01.299
Charges set.

512
00:30:01.299 --> 00:30:03.010
Priming zone for detonation.

513
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:05.554
Come on.
We need to blow this ridge.

514
00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:07.472
Yeah, okay, okay.

515
00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:09.391
We don't wanna be down here
any longer than needs be.

516
00:30:11.768 --> 00:30:13.895
Yeah, well,
this is the only place

517
00:30:13.895 --> 00:30:15.397
to mine this stuff.

518
00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:18.942
Slow and steady.

519
00:30:18.942 --> 00:30:20.485
Hey, Montes.

520
00:30:20.485 --> 00:30:21.528
Why do you get to stay
in the submarine?

521
00:30:23.030 --> 00:30:25.407
It's good
to be the king.

522
00:30:25.407 --> 00:30:27.159
Incoming object detected.

523
00:30:29.953 --> 00:30:31.538
Zoom in 400%.

524
00:30:42.424 --> 00:30:45.135
Mana One crew is below us.

525
00:30:45.135 --> 00:30:47.971
There's no way
they haven't seen the station.

526
00:30:47.971 --> 00:30:49.681
What are we gonna do?

527
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:52.017
I'm arming
the explosives right now.

528
00:30:52.017 --> 00:30:53.435
You have to get out.

529
00:30:53.435 --> 00:30:55.353
What? Wait, no,
you can't do that.

530
00:30:55.353 --> 00:30:57.189
There isn't time.
You know there isn't time.

531
00:30:57.189 --> 00:30:58.899
It will take ten minutes
to get clear.

532
00:31:00.275 --> 00:31:01.193
Montes!

533
00:31:08.283 --> 00:31:09.743
Sorry, guys.

534
00:31:09.743 --> 00:31:11.328
Montes!
Montes, don't do it!

535
00:31:15.165 --> 00:31:16.166
What was that?

536
00:31:18.627 --> 00:31:20.212
Landslide!

537
00:31:20.212 --> 00:31:22.297
I can't get ahead of it.
I'm gonna have to go through.

538
00:31:56.873 --> 00:31:58.166
Guys?
What's happening?

539
00:31:58.166 --> 00:31:59.918
I'm reading
a thermocline breach.

540
00:31:59.918 --> 00:32:02.087
Something's ripped
a giant hole in it.

541
00:32:13.390 --> 00:32:15.392
Rerouting the thrusters.
This is all we've got.

542
00:32:21.106 --> 00:32:22.691
Vertical control is down.

543
00:32:23.775 --> 00:32:24.985
Hydraulics are non-responsive.

544
00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:29.865
We're pinned.

545
00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:32.826
Coming in.

546
00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.746
- Hold us steady.
- Yeah.

547
00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:42.586
Jiuming.
Sixty degrees down.

548
00:32:42.586 --> 00:32:44.045
Two feet forward.

549
00:32:47.716 --> 00:32:48.675
Jiuming!

550
00:32:58.018 --> 00:32:58.977
Go, go, go!

551
00:33:00.395 --> 00:33:01.771
Full thrust! Full thrust!

552
00:33:13.575 --> 00:33:14.451
Jiuming!

553
00:33:16.036 --> 00:33:16.828
No!

554
00:33:28.048 --> 00:33:29.466
There's no telemetry.

555
00:33:31.635 --> 00:33:34.179
Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

556
00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:37.474
Dive 1, Dive 2. Do you copy?

557
00:33:39.601 --> 00:33:41.937
We've got nothing here.

558
00:33:41.937 --> 00:33:45.774
Keep trying, DJ. Jess,
prep the rescue sub. Stat.

559
00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:47.901
- Ugh, what happened?
- I don't know.

560
00:33:49.986 --> 00:33:51.738
How do we know
if they're still alive?

561
00:33:51.738 --> 00:33:53.156
Prep the rescue vehicle.

562
00:33:55.909 --> 00:33:58.370
Dive 1, Dive 2.
Do you copy?

563
00:33:59.162 --> 00:34:00.330
Come on, Jonas.

564
00:34:02.749 --> 00:34:04.209
Meiying.

565
00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:07.504
Meiying.

566
00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:10.257
- Meiying.

567
00:34:10.257 --> 00:34:11.800
What happened?

568
00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.968
Took a nasty hit.

569
00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:16.096
Uncle Jiuming?

570
00:34:17.013 --> 00:34:18.640
Where's Uncle Jiuming?

571
00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.184
- Where is he?
- We can't raise him.

572
00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:23.979
Hey. We work the problems
one by one.

573
00:34:25.188 --> 00:34:26.231
We do what's in front of us...

574
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:28.566
...and then we do
the next thing.

575
00:34:29.943 --> 00:34:31.236
We're gonna be okay.

576
00:34:32.779 --> 00:34:34.322
Mac!

577
00:34:34.322 --> 00:34:36.616
The rescue sub isn't working.

578
00:34:36.616 --> 00:34:39.035
The battery array
was deliberately shorted out.

579
00:34:39.035 --> 00:34:40.370
It looks like sabotage.

580
00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:41.454
How's that possible?

581
00:34:41.454 --> 00:34:42.872
This isn't a secure area.

582
00:34:42.872 --> 00:34:44.207
There are 30 people
who work here.

583
00:34:44.207 --> 00:34:45.917
Well, how long to fix it?

584
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.378
It's the control boards, Mac.
There is no fixing it.

585
00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.258
Try it now.

586
00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:54.551
What's our status?

587
00:34:54.551 --> 00:34:55.635
No comms, no heat.

588
00:34:56.803 --> 00:34:58.513
We're losing air fast.

589
00:34:58.513 --> 00:34:59.681
This isn't working.

590
00:34:59.681 --> 00:35:01.099
Flood in my extra O2.

591
00:35:02.684 --> 00:35:03.810
Already done.

592
00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.104
I've got one last idea.

593
00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:08.106
Route the power
through the heating cell.

594
00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:16.531
I got Dive 1.
Mac, I got Dive 1.

595
00:35:16.531 --> 00:35:18.700
- Jonas?

596
00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:20.327
Good to hear your voice, Mac.

597
00:35:20.327 --> 00:35:22.579
Not as good as it is
to hear yours, brother.

598
00:35:22.579 --> 00:35:24.080
Talk to me.

599
00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:25.999
It ain't good.

600
00:35:25.999 --> 00:35:28.668
Almost every system is down,
and we're losing air fast.

601
00:35:28.668 --> 00:35:31.588
We'll get into
the emergency dive suits...

602
00:35:31.588 --> 00:35:32.922
and we're gonna need
a ride up.

603
00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:35.342
Jonas...

604
00:35:36.384 --> 00:35:37.635
it's not gonna be possible.

605
00:35:39.012 --> 00:35:40.513
What are you talking about?

606
00:35:40.513 --> 00:35:42.390
The battery array.
It shorted out

607
00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:44.351
the control board
in the rescue sub.

608
00:35:44.351 --> 00:35:45.852
We're investigating it now.

609
00:35:49.314 --> 00:35:50.231
Jonas?

610
00:35:51.608 --> 00:35:52.692
Jonas, can you hear me?

611
00:35:54.611 --> 00:35:56.029
Jonas, we can't get to you.

612
00:35:59.949 --> 00:36:00.950
We're gonna walk.

613
00:36:02.952 --> 00:36:04.371
We're gonna walk back
across the trench.

614
00:36:04.371 --> 00:36:06.456
Make it into
that sea floor station.

615
00:36:06.456 --> 00:36:07.999
And we're gonna get inside.

616
00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:09.876
And then we're gonna get
to the surface.

617
00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:12.379
Those suits have
two hours of air tops.

618
00:36:12.379 --> 00:36:14.881
They're only designed
for brief extravehicular work.

619
00:36:14.881 --> 00:36:17.300
We'll go slow and steady.
They'll hold.

620
00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.177
It's three kilometers.

621
00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:21.096
You'll be defenseless
out there.

622
00:36:21.096 --> 00:36:22.931
What do you want from me, Mac?

623
00:36:22.931 --> 00:36:25.558
This is what we got, and this
is what we're gonna do.

624
00:36:28.019 --> 00:36:29.646
Half our team is dead,

625
00:36:29.646 --> 00:36:31.314
and I'm not losing
the other half.

626
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:39.864
Beginning suit initialization.

627
00:36:39.864 --> 00:36:41.908
Joint actuators functioning.

628
00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:45.370
Ultrasonic signal
communications online.

629
00:36:45.370 --> 00:36:47.205
Initialization complete.

630
00:36:50.291 --> 00:36:52.710
Abandoning Dive 1, Mac.

631
00:36:54.129 --> 00:36:55.171
The radios won't relay
to the surface,

632
00:36:55.171 --> 00:36:56.756
so we're going dark.

633
00:36:56.756 --> 00:36:58.800
Talk to you on the other side.

634
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:00.135
Godspeed, Jonas.

635
00:37:06.933 --> 00:37:08.768
Emergency escape initiated.

636
00:37:54.355 --> 00:37:55.440
Hey. Whoa!

637
00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.109
Almost killed you.

638
00:37:59.152 --> 00:38:00.278
The hell are you doing?

639
00:38:00.278 --> 00:38:02.030
Saving your ass.

640
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:03.740
And walking back
to that station.

641
00:38:05.492 --> 00:38:07.160
What are you doing?

642
00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.828
Saving your ass.

643
00:38:08.828 --> 00:38:11.247
And walking back
to that station.

644
00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:12.832
- Don't have much time.
- Let's get going.

645
00:38:15.502 --> 00:38:16.878
- Jiu.
- Oh.

646
00:38:18.546 --> 00:38:20.548
Uncle, I thought you--

647
00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:22.425
You're not going
to get rid of me that easily.

648
00:38:24.511 --> 00:38:25.595
Hey.

649
00:38:25.595 --> 00:38:27.639
Hey. Let me check.

650
00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:28.723
Air left...

651
00:38:28.723 --> 00:38:30.308
Hey, you need to calm down

652
00:38:30.308 --> 00:38:31.809
or you're gonna
run out of oxygen, Lance.

653
00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:33.603
I don't think i can.

654
00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:35.355
Think of it as cosplay.

655
00:38:35.355 --> 00:38:38.775
Or we could
be paintballing.

656
00:38:38.775 --> 00:38:40.610
Like the ultimate
team-building exercise.

657
00:38:40.610 --> 00:38:42.028
We need
to cover distance

658
00:38:42.028 --> 00:38:43.863
while the megs
are still occupied.

659
00:38:43.863 --> 00:38:45.448
Three
kilometers to destination.

660
00:38:45.448 --> 00:38:47.325
Away from the megs
is fine by me.

661
00:38:47.325 --> 00:38:49.035
We're a strong group.

662
00:38:49.035 --> 00:38:50.286
We can do this.

663
00:38:52.789 --> 00:38:54.624
Amazing.

664
00:38:54.624 --> 00:38:57.585
Lighting courtesy
of Mother Nature.

665
00:38:57.585 --> 00:38:59.045
It's incredible,

666
00:38:59.045 --> 00:39:01.172
there are new species
all around us.

667
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.466
Hey. Look.

668
00:39:03.466 --> 00:39:05.301
Look at this.
It's beautiful.

669
00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:11.140
Hello,
my little biolum--

670
00:39:12.892 --> 00:39:15.186
There's a snake!
There's a snake!

671
00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:17.188
Get this monster off my head!

672
00:39:22.235 --> 00:39:23.820
No touching stuff.

673
00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:25.863
He started it.

674
00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:29.701
Everyone
clear the station.

675
00:39:29.701 --> 00:39:31.327
DJ, what's our time on Jonas?

676
00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:33.162
Forty-one minutes
since they went dark.

677
00:39:33.162 --> 00:39:34.539
At best,
it'll take another hour

678
00:39:34.539 --> 00:39:35.707
for them
to cover the distance.

679
00:39:35.707 --> 00:39:37.542
Listen up.

680
00:39:37.542 --> 00:39:39.586
We know there's some kind of
rogue operation in the trench.

681
00:39:39.586 --> 00:39:40.795
Now, some bastard's
got his fingers

682
00:39:40.795 --> 00:39:42.297
in our operation here.

683
00:39:42.297 --> 00:39:44.340
That sub was
definitely sabotaged,

684
00:39:44.340 --> 00:39:45.925
so we've got a mole
on the station.

685
00:39:45.925 --> 00:39:48.344
DJ, I want you to pull
all surveillance footage

686
00:39:48.344 --> 00:39:50.513
from the sub bay
for the last 24 hours.

687
00:39:50.513 --> 00:39:52.724
Jess, run the personnel files
on the crew,

688
00:39:52.724 --> 00:39:54.726
look for anything suspect.

689
00:39:54.726 --> 00:39:56.060
We're gonna get
these sons of bitches,

690
00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:57.812
but we have to watch
our own backs.

691
00:39:57.812 --> 00:40:00.815
One of us mans the DCC
at all times, understood?

692
00:40:00.815 --> 00:40:01.858
Yes.

693
00:40:05.987 --> 00:40:08.448
Is it just me,

694
00:40:08.448 --> 00:40:10.533
or does walking
three kilometers underwater

695
00:40:10.533 --> 00:40:12.285
sound like hard work?

696
00:40:12.285 --> 00:40:14.329
It certainly wasn't
on my to-do list.

697
00:40:17.832 --> 00:40:20.335
Baby octopi.

698
00:40:20.335 --> 00:40:22.503
So many colors.
That's incredible.

699
00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:27.592
Anybody wanna play
a game?

700
00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:28.676
A game?

701
00:40:28.676 --> 00:40:30.261
This isn't a game.

702
00:40:30.261 --> 00:40:32.764
She means to keep
our minds occupied.

703
00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:35.642
Right now, my mind is
pretty damn occupied.

704
00:40:56.829 --> 00:40:59.207
There's a... there's a...
It's...

705
00:40:59.791 --> 00:41:00.917
Lance?

706
00:41:00.917 --> 00:41:02.627
What was it?

707
00:41:02.627 --> 00:41:04.629
- I didn't see.
- Where's Lance?

708
00:41:04.629 --> 00:41:05.963
Is it a meg?

709
00:41:08.424 --> 00:41:10.551
Some... something's
happened to him. I know it.

710
00:41:10.551 --> 00:41:11.678
Lance?

711
00:41:15.431 --> 00:41:18.351
No. Oh, no.

712
00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:19.977
We have to keep moving.

713
00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.729
No, we... We can't just
leave him out there.

714
00:41:21.729 --> 00:41:23.147
We need to find him!

715
00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.565
Please, Jiuming.

716
00:41:24.565 --> 00:41:25.733
- I'm sorry.

717
00:41:26.651 --> 00:41:27.527
He's gone.

718
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:33.116
Rigas, cover our six.
Shoot anything that moves.

719
00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:37.161
You bet your ass I will.

720
00:41:53.678 --> 00:41:55.555
Comms online.

721
00:41:58.307 --> 00:42:00.601
What happened to you?

722
00:42:00.601 --> 00:42:03.354
The Mana One crew
stumbled upon our station.

723
00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.231
I took them out
with a landslide.

724
00:42:05.231 --> 00:42:07.817
Okay, this is...
this is out of control.

725
00:42:07.817 --> 00:42:09.527
You authorized me

726
00:42:09.527 --> 00:42:12.530
to do whatever's necessary
to protect our operation.

727
00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:14.157
No.

728
00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.451
They're not dead.

729
00:42:16.451 --> 00:42:20.621
They are walking right now
to the station.

730
00:42:20.621 --> 00:42:21.873
If they get there,

731
00:42:22.749 --> 00:42:24.459
we are screwed.

732
00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:28.421
There's still
a kilometer to go,

733
00:42:28.421 --> 00:42:29.756
straight through
that valley,

734
00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:31.215
and we don't have

735
00:42:31.215 --> 00:42:33.134
the bioluminescence
to cover us.

736
00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:34.427
We're going to be
totally exposed out there.

737
00:42:34.427 --> 00:42:36.053
We don't have a choice.

738
00:42:36.053 --> 00:42:38.473
We only have enough air
to go straight through.

739
00:42:38.473 --> 00:42:42.310
Let's keep
our lights on low spectrum.

740
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:44.228
Yeah. We don't want
to attract the megs.

741
00:42:44.228 --> 00:42:46.981
One kilometer to destination.

742
00:42:46.981 --> 00:42:48.608
- O2 check?

743
00:42:48.608 --> 00:42:50.193
65%.

744
00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:51.277
50.

745
00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:53.488
26%.

746
00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:55.031
It's not gonna be enough.

747
00:42:55.031 --> 00:42:56.616
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.

748
00:42:56.616 --> 00:42:58.910
Look at me, okay? Focus, okay?

749
00:42:58.910 --> 00:43:01.496
You can do this.
Remember the training.

750
00:43:03.122 --> 00:43:04.832
Anything on sonar?

751
00:43:04.832 --> 00:43:07.168
I got something,
right at the edge of my range.

752
00:43:08.211 --> 00:43:09.921
Keeps going in and out.

753
00:43:13.090 --> 00:43:14.258
Stalking us.

754
00:43:23.059 --> 00:43:24.352
Proximity alert.

755
00:43:26.062 --> 00:43:27.480
- What is it?

756
00:43:33.402 --> 00:43:34.612
It's just
a shoal of fish.

757
00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.824
Stay calm, everyone.

758
00:43:37.824 --> 00:43:39.575
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

759
00:43:39.575 --> 00:43:40.701
Keep moving.

760
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:44.831
Ayo, Mac.

761
00:43:44.831 --> 00:43:46.415
We got jack
on the security footage.

762
00:43:46.415 --> 00:43:47.625
Somebody deleted it.

763
00:43:47.625 --> 00:43:48.709
For the sub bay?

764
00:43:48.709 --> 00:43:50.670
For the whole damn station.

765
00:43:50.670 --> 00:43:52.421
They're good, but they don't
know everything.

766
00:43:52.421 --> 00:43:54.590
There's a satellite uplink
with an encrypted backup.

767
00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:56.008
I'm gonna go
to the server room,

768
00:43:56.008 --> 00:43:57.385
see if I can pull it down.

769
00:43:57.385 --> 00:43:58.886
Time?

770
00:43:58.886 --> 00:44:00.304
One hour, 50.
They'll be out of air soon.

771
00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:02.390
I'm scanning all channels,
but nothing yet.

772
00:44:07.478 --> 00:44:10.398
That's it.
Maybe 400 meters.

773
00:44:15.945 --> 00:44:16.946
Warning.

774
00:44:16.946 --> 00:44:18.447
Entering oxygen reserves.

775
00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:20.283
You can do this.

776
00:44:20.283 --> 00:44:22.285
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

777
00:44:22.285 --> 00:44:24.036
I'm getting
a reading.

778
00:44:24.036 --> 00:44:25.705
Many contacts to our right.

779
00:44:27.081 --> 00:44:28.124
Coming in fast.

780
00:44:31.127 --> 00:44:32.753
What, megs?

781
00:44:32.753 --> 00:44:36.048
No. Smaller. Faster.

782
00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:41.679
Everybody make it
to the station!

783
00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:43.389
- Go, move!
- Warning.

784
00:44:43.389 --> 00:44:45.016
- Oxygen level low.
- Come on.

785
00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:45.725
- Come on.
- I'm out of air.

786
00:44:47.059 --> 00:44:48.477
They're coming
over the ridge!

787
00:44:52.773 --> 00:44:54.025
What are those things?

788
00:44:54.025 --> 00:44:55.484
It's too far.

789
00:44:55.484 --> 00:44:57.570
We need
to make a stand!

790
00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:58.738
Turn and fight!

791
00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.920
Come on!

792
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:19.133
- Meiying!

793
00:45:19.133 --> 00:45:20.843
Help!
Shoot their head!

794
00:45:20.843 --> 00:45:22.136
- Meiying!
- Uncle!

795
00:45:25.097 --> 00:45:26.515
I've got you!

796
00:45:26.515 --> 00:45:28.517
Hold on!

797
00:45:28.517 --> 00:45:29.226
They're biting
through the suit.

798
00:45:32.438 --> 00:45:33.564
Meiying!

799
00:45:42.782 --> 00:45:44.700
No. No.

800
00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.243
Hold on, Curtis!

801
00:45:46.243 --> 00:45:48.245
Too many!
We don't have a chance!

802
00:46:07.098 --> 00:46:08.307
Everybody stay back!

803
00:46:10.226 --> 00:46:11.394
Keep going!

804
00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:20.277
Jiuming!

805
00:46:20.277 --> 00:46:21.570
There's no choice.

806
00:46:23.114 --> 00:46:24.657
You really want to die,
don't you?

807
00:46:49.598 --> 00:46:51.350
Gotta make it
to the airlock!

808
00:47:04.697 --> 00:47:05.906
Warning. Low air.

809
00:47:05.906 --> 00:47:07.283
It's no use

810
00:47:07.283 --> 00:47:08.117
- I'm holding you back.
- Low air.

811
00:47:11.954 --> 00:47:13.622
- It's not too far.

812
00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:15.166
You can make it!

813
00:47:15.166 --> 00:47:16.834
Warning. Low air.

814
00:47:19.170 --> 00:47:20.755
- Warning. Low air.

815
00:47:22.631 --> 00:47:23.924
Air depleted.

816
00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:35.811
- Uncle!

817
00:47:35.811 --> 00:47:37.521
Visor failure imminent.

818
00:47:39.023 --> 00:47:40.107
Jiuming!

819
00:47:47.281 --> 00:47:49.366
Okay. We gotta go.
We don't have a choice.

820
00:47:49.366 --> 00:47:50.951
He's coming
back around!

821
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:52.703
- Oh, God!
- Go, go, go!

822
00:47:55.581 --> 00:47:56.832
We have to do the override.

823
00:47:59.418 --> 00:48:01.087
Come on, hurry up.

824
00:48:01.087 --> 00:48:03.881
- Rigas, come on!

825
00:48:03.881 --> 00:48:05.091
You can do it.
Get in!

826
00:48:07.676 --> 00:48:10.096
- Shut the door!

827
00:48:10.096 --> 00:48:11.597
Curtis, you'll be okay.

828
00:48:11.597 --> 00:48:13.599
Suit implosion imminent.

829
00:48:13.599 --> 00:48:14.308
- Almost there. Almost there!
- Oh, my God.

830
00:48:17.061 --> 00:48:18.354
It's gonna implode.

831
00:48:18.354 --> 00:48:19.730
Depressurize the room!

832
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.482
- No, no, no.

833
00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:23.025
- No!

834
00:49:05.234 --> 00:49:07.194
Son of a bitch!

835
00:49:07.194 --> 00:49:08.612
I hate these things!

836
00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:12.116
Hey, Rigas.

837
00:49:12.116 --> 00:49:13.868
Let's try to keep it together.

838
00:49:15.536 --> 00:49:16.996
We ain't out of the woods yet.

839
00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:46.150
Rigas.

840
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:59.830
Where is everybody?

841
00:50:15.804 --> 00:50:17.223
What is that smell?

842
00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.100
Divers.

843
00:50:28.817 --> 00:50:29.860
Nobody home.

844
00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:32.446
I'll cover the door.

845
00:50:38.869 --> 00:50:42.831
Whoever's running this
is not our friend.

846
00:50:42.831 --> 00:50:44.166
We need to contact
Mana One ASAP.

847
00:50:44.166 --> 00:50:45.459
Think you can handle it?

848
00:50:45.459 --> 00:50:46.794
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

849
00:50:50.422 --> 00:50:52.424
What is this
that they're mining?

850
00:50:52.424 --> 00:50:54.260
Whatever it is,
they're sending it

851
00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.262
up to the surface
with these pods.

852
00:51:02.851 --> 00:51:05.729
Mmm. Rare earth metals.

853
00:51:05.729 --> 00:51:07.314
They're used
in superconductors,

854
00:51:07.314 --> 00:51:10.150
aerospace
and quantum computing.

855
00:51:10.150 --> 00:51:13.570
This box alone
could be a billion dollars.

856
00:51:14.905 --> 00:51:16.573
"Billion" with a "B?"

857
00:51:16.573 --> 00:51:17.658
Yes.

858
00:51:17.658 --> 00:51:18.742
- Mana One.

859
00:51:18.742 --> 00:51:20.411
Jonas. Comms are live.

860
00:51:25.249 --> 00:51:26.542
Come in.

861
00:51:26.542 --> 00:51:28.335
It's Jonas. Getting this?

862
00:51:28.335 --> 00:51:29.628
Hey, you're alive.

863
00:51:29.628 --> 00:51:31.964
What's your status?

864
00:51:31.964 --> 00:51:34.341
We lost Lance,
Sal, and Curtis.

865
00:51:35.718 --> 00:51:37.011
We're at the station.

866
00:51:37.011 --> 00:51:39.638
It's a rogue mining operation.

867
00:51:39.638 --> 00:51:41.056
Is there anyone down there?

868
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.933
Not that we've seen so far.

869
00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:44.393
They've infiltrated Mana One.

870
00:51:44.393 --> 00:51:46.437
The rescue sub was sabotaged.

871
00:51:46.437 --> 00:51:48.647
- By who?
- We're working on it.

872
00:51:48.647 --> 00:51:49.732
But check this out.

873
00:51:49.732 --> 00:51:51.400
I was going over the video

874
00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.736
of when you went
over that station before.

875
00:51:53.736 --> 00:51:55.112
Look at the north side.

876
00:51:57.948 --> 00:52:00.576
Looks like
emergency escape pods.

877
00:52:00.576 --> 00:52:02.953
It's the opposite
side from where we are.

878
00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:20.304
Feels dead in here.

879
00:52:20.304 --> 00:52:21.430
Stay close.

880
00:52:24.558 --> 00:52:26.018
These are my designs.

881
00:52:27.186 --> 00:52:28.354
How do they have this?

882
00:52:40.866 --> 00:52:42.159
Looks like this is it.

883
00:52:53.420 --> 00:52:54.546
On three.

884
00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:56.090
Three.

885
00:53:00.552 --> 00:53:01.762
- Again.
- It's not gonna work.

886
00:53:13.399 --> 00:53:14.400
After you.

887
00:53:17.653 --> 00:53:19.988
Ah,
this is more like it.

888
00:53:19.988 --> 00:53:22.032
Let's crack open a pod
and get out of here.

889
00:53:24.326 --> 00:53:26.161
Nothing here.

890
00:53:26.161 --> 00:53:28.038
These controls ain't working.

891
00:53:28.038 --> 00:53:29.373
We need to close the hatch.

892
00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:30.541
On it.

893
00:53:35.129 --> 00:53:37.339
Guys, that wasn't me.

894
00:53:39.508 --> 00:53:42.052
Jonas,
now that I have you here,

895
00:53:42.052 --> 00:53:43.554
we need to talk candidly.

896
00:53:43.554 --> 00:53:45.222
I have full control
of the station,

897
00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:46.807
and I've locked down
this room.

898
00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:48.016
Jess?

899
00:53:48.016 --> 00:53:49.685
Your life is in my hands.

900
00:53:49.685 --> 00:53:50.936
What are you doing, Jess?

901
00:53:53.397 --> 00:53:55.774
These are your friends.

902
00:53:55.774 --> 00:53:57.401
They've been with you
for years.

903
00:53:57.401 --> 00:53:58.986
I know it hurts.

904
00:53:58.986 --> 00:54:00.487
And we're talking
because I'd prefer

905
00:54:00.487 --> 00:54:02.364
we were on the same side.

906
00:54:02.364 --> 00:54:04.575
All making so much money,
it ceases to have meaning.

907
00:54:04.575 --> 00:54:06.034
You're offering us money?

908
00:54:08.704 --> 00:54:10.956
Three of our friends are dead
because of you.

909
00:54:10.956 --> 00:54:12.875
You think
I'm gonna forget about that?

910
00:54:16.587 --> 00:54:19.173
No, no, no, no, no!
That's the first escape pod!

911
00:54:19.173 --> 00:54:20.632
Son of a bitch!

912
00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:24.803
Rigas?
Rigas, you can save Meiying.

913
00:54:24.803 --> 00:54:27.681
Take that speargun
and shoot Jonas in the heart.

914
00:54:49.495 --> 00:54:51.038
Don't shoot him.

915
00:55:03.926 --> 00:55:04.885
Do it.

916
00:55:05.636 --> 00:55:06.803
Go ahead.

917
00:55:09.139 --> 00:55:11.016
It's the only way
Meiying survives.

918
00:55:15.229 --> 00:55:16.313
Do it.

919
00:55:18.524 --> 00:55:19.483
Rigas!

920
00:55:20.943 --> 00:55:22.569
Do it!

921
00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:27.199
- Do it!
- No. I'm sorry.

922
00:55:27.199 --> 00:55:30.911
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I can't.
I can't. I can't.

923
00:55:38.669 --> 00:55:40.379
That was the last pod.

924
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:44.716
I told you that wouldn't work.

925
00:55:44.716 --> 00:55:45.842
Put me on.

926
00:55:48.679 --> 00:55:50.889
Oh, sorry
it had to come to this.

927
00:55:52.099 --> 00:55:53.433
So...

928
00:55:53.433 --> 00:55:55.060
we'll be back at work
in a week,

929
00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:59.022
using your technology
to take whatever we want.

930
00:55:59.022 --> 00:56:02.568
Your institute'll be
a platform that we use

931
00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:05.988
to plunder the ocean
for decades.

932
00:56:05.988 --> 00:56:07.739
Karma will get you.

933
00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:08.699
And before you start whining

934
00:56:08.699 --> 00:56:10.117
about the ecosystem,

935
00:56:10.117 --> 00:56:12.119
who cares?
We'll make billions.

936
00:56:12.119 --> 00:56:14.538
And no one is going to see
the damage we do.

937
00:56:14.538 --> 00:56:15.622
Shut up!

938
00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:19.293
Jess,
I've already dispatched

939
00:56:19.293 --> 00:56:21.670
a clean-up crew to Mana One.

940
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:22.796
Finish this.

941
00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:30.012
How do we
open the door?

942
00:56:30.012 --> 00:56:32.306
If we could
cut the comm link
to the surface...

943
00:56:33.432 --> 00:56:34.808
she couldn't control anything.

944
00:56:34.808 --> 00:56:36.268
But it's back
in the first room,

945
00:56:36.268 --> 00:56:38.312
and there's no getting through
this door.

946
00:56:38.312 --> 00:56:40.355
This airlock still works!

947
00:56:40.355 --> 00:56:42.608
Why would you go through
the airlock? There's no pod.

948
00:56:42.608 --> 00:56:44.735
I'll swim to the airlock
where we came in

949
00:56:44.735 --> 00:56:46.153
and do the override.

950
00:56:46.153 --> 00:56:49.281
You have no suit.
How could it work?

951
00:56:49.281 --> 00:56:51.325
Water doesn't compress
under pressure,

952
00:56:51.325 --> 00:56:53.410
so if he can force water
in his sinus cavities,

953
00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:55.954
he could survive 30,
maybe 60 seconds

954
00:56:55.954 --> 00:56:57.372
before he passes out.

955
00:56:57.372 --> 00:56:58.540
- It is possible.

956
00:57:01.043 --> 00:57:02.919
We work the problems
one by one.

957
00:57:04.671 --> 00:57:07.549
We do what's in front of us,
then we do the next thing.

958
00:57:15.724 --> 00:57:17.309
If anyone
can do this,

959
00:57:17.976 --> 00:57:18.935
it's you.

960
00:57:36.745 --> 00:57:39.206
Won't he be crushed
by the pressure?

961
00:57:39.206 --> 00:57:41.083
It doesn't work
like that.

962
00:57:41.083 --> 00:57:44.753
You don't see fish
wearing metal suits, do you?

963
00:57:44.753 --> 00:57:47.839
It's about air.
It reacts under pressure.

964
00:57:47.839 --> 00:57:50.550
And that's why he has to
blow it out of his sinuses.

965
00:58:50.277 --> 00:58:51.987
Hey there,
tree hugger.

966
00:58:56.241 --> 00:58:59.077
Jonas Taylor, eco-warrior,

967
00:58:59.077 --> 00:59:01.121
fighting the good fight.

968
00:59:01.121 --> 00:59:03.123
Well, guess what?

969
00:59:03.123 --> 00:59:04.166
You lost.

970
00:59:09.087 --> 00:59:12.799
I spent two years
in a Manila prison

971
00:59:12.799 --> 00:59:15.677
after you
and your eco-freak buddies

972
00:59:16.553 --> 00:59:18.555
had our ship seized.

973
00:59:18.555 --> 00:59:21.141
I thought about you
every single day.

974
00:59:22.768 --> 00:59:25.395
You don't even remember me,
do you?

975
00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:26.938
- Hmm?

976
00:59:26.938 --> 00:59:28.440
No?

977
00:59:28.440 --> 00:59:30.650
Montes.

978
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:33.612
There's a million scumbags
in this world.

979
00:59:36.615 --> 00:59:38.617
It's hard to keep track
of all of 'em.

980
00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.635
I don't think I can make it!

981
00:59:56.635 --> 00:59:58.178
You can do it. It's okay.

982
01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:48.478
We're going to die!

983
01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:49.521
It's ok, it's ok.

984
01:01:47.579 --> 01:01:48.538
Meiying!

985
01:01:49.414 --> 01:01:50.373
Meiying!

986
01:02:09.601 --> 01:02:11.603
Clean up crew
approaching Mana One.

987
01:02:11.603 --> 01:02:13.772
About time.
We are on alert.

988
01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:16.274
Everyone confined
to their quarters.

989
01:02:16.274 --> 01:02:18.735
We need to get control
of Mana One

990
01:02:18.735 --> 01:02:20.695
and dispose
of any liabilities.

991
01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:26.952
What's the emergency?

992
01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:28.912
I got into
the security backup.

993
01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:29.996
Look at this.

994
01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:33.708
Jess disabled the rescue sub.

995
01:02:35.210 --> 01:02:37.253
- What?
- Watch.

996
01:02:37.253 --> 01:02:38.922
Like she could be
repairing it, right?

997
01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:40.173
But no, wait.

998
01:02:44.552 --> 01:02:45.971
It's Montes' sub.

999
01:02:45.971 --> 01:02:47.514
That's our ride out of here.

1000
01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.982
There's a leak
in the hydraulics.

1001
01:02:56.982 --> 01:02:58.775
Predator countermeasures
are down.

1002
01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.777
We'll never make it
past the megs.

1003
01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.445
We need
a distraction.

1004
01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.116
Light up the station.
The megs will attack it.

1005
01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:07.659
Yeah. And kill us.

1006
01:03:08.576 --> 01:03:10.161
Not if we're fast enough.

1007
01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:11.079
Jiuming!

1008
01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:21.006
- Hey, Rigas.
- Yep?

1009
01:03:21.006 --> 01:03:22.841
For a moment, I thought you
were gonna kill me back there.

1010
01:03:22.841 --> 01:03:25.427
Well, she did say
to shoot you in the heart.

1011
01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:27.721
And I know for a fact
you ain't got one of those.

1012
01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.227
Thank you for working.

1013
01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:49.701
Gotta close
the hatch, Jonas.

1014
01:03:53.955 --> 01:03:55.081
We're all gonna die.

1015
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.834
He's gonna make it.

1016
01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:58.835
No, he's not.

1017
01:04:02.088 --> 01:04:03.339
- He's gonna make it.
- No!

1018
01:04:03.339 --> 01:04:05.341
We have to close the hatch!

1019
01:04:10.138 --> 01:04:11.681
- Close it! Jonas!

1020
01:04:20.523 --> 01:04:21.649
I'm here!

1021
01:04:23.526 --> 01:04:24.903
- That's him!

1022
01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.499
That was close.

1023
01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.251
Too close.

1024
01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:45.173
You should have shut
the hatch.

1025
01:04:45.173 --> 01:04:47.050
Yeah.
Meiying would have killed me.

1026
01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:52.889
You thought about it, though.

1027
01:04:52.889 --> 01:04:54.265
Yeah. We thought about it.

1028
01:04:55.058 --> 01:04:56.142
Didn't we, Rigas?

1029
01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:57.936
Shut up.

1030
01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.022
Just a little bit.

1031
01:05:01.022 --> 01:05:02.816
Very funny.

1032
01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:12.200
Explosives?

1033
01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:14.786
Check this out.

1034
01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:16.454
Look what else.

1035
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.177
Is that gonna be
a problem?

1036
01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:33.388
It's a hole
in the thermal layer.

1037
01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:36.516
It must have been caused
by the mining explosions.

1038
01:05:36.516 --> 01:05:38.017
It will seal up eventually.

1039
01:05:38.852 --> 01:05:40.395
Eventually?

1040
01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:42.897
Yeah. Within an hour.

1041
01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.858
Can the megs
follow us through?

1042
01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.152
I hope not.

1043
01:06:11.634 --> 01:06:13.511
Boys,
I don't want to harm you,

1044
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:15.597
but I do need you
to come out of this room.

1045
01:06:15.597 --> 01:06:17.849
It's Jess.
She's got three soldiers.

1046
01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:20.560
Yeah. It's go time.

1047
01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:22.770
Take this.

1048
01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.063
- The hell is this?
- It's a Taser.

1049
01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:26.566
Open up.

1050
01:06:26.566 --> 01:06:27.859
They tried to kill Jonas,

1051
01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:29.027
they're definitely
gonna kill us.

1052
01:06:29.027 --> 01:06:30.528
Okay, listen.
Here's the plan.

1053
01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:32.447
On the count of three,
you'll open the door

1054
01:06:32.447 --> 01:06:34.199
and I'mma pepper spray 'em.

1055
01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.491
Right, and you'll shut the door
and you're gonna wait.

1056
01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:37.202
Then go out there
and use the Taser.

1057
01:06:37.202 --> 01:06:38.828
One, two, three.

1058
01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.792
- No, Mac, no! No, Mac...

1059
01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.670
It burns! It burns!

1060
01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:49.130
- I'm sorry!

1061
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.757
Sleepy time.

1062
01:07:05.438 --> 01:07:06.397
- What's that?

1063
01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:10.485
Trouble.

1064
01:07:18.618 --> 01:07:20.787
So, we're walking fast
and with

1065
01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.872
a lot of determination,
which is great.

1066
01:07:22.872 --> 01:07:25.083
But what exactly
is the plan here?

1067
01:07:25.083 --> 01:07:26.459
They're armed and we're not.

1068
01:07:31.839 --> 01:07:33.299
All righty.
So what are you thinking?

1069
01:07:34.717 --> 01:07:36.719
What are you thinking?

1070
01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:38.346
You and I find Mac and DJ.

1071
01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:39.931
Rigas, grab what you can.

1072
01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:41.224
Secure a Zodiac
so we can get off this thing.

1073
01:07:41.224 --> 01:07:42.684
Rock and roll.

1074
01:07:42.684 --> 01:07:44.352
Safest if Meiying
goes with you.

1075
01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.737
I'll protect her with my life.

1076
01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:55.905
And I'll protect her
with mine.

1077
01:07:56.698 --> 01:07:58.908
No.

1078
01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.034
No.

1079
01:08:01.369 --> 01:08:02.328
Let's go.

1080
01:08:14.674 --> 01:08:16.759
I told you to wait
before you went out that door.

1081
01:08:16.759 --> 01:08:18.761
- How's your eyes?
- My eye stings.

1082
01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:21.723
If we climb up
to the communications array,

1083
01:08:21.723 --> 01:08:23.975
we can bypass the DCC
and we can call for help.

1084
01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:25.184
What are we supposed to say?

1085
01:08:25.184 --> 01:08:27.520
Uh... terrorist action?

1086
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.981
- Yeah, good. Terrorist action.
- Yeah, terrorist action.

1087
01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:31.357
- Okay.
- You got a better idea?

1088
01:08:31.357 --> 01:08:32.984
- Freeze!

1089
01:08:32.984 --> 01:08:34.027
Oh, no.

1090
01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:45.413
DJ! DJ!

1091
01:08:47.415 --> 01:08:48.499
What the hell?

1092
01:08:48.499 --> 01:08:51.711
Wow! Yeah, baby!
Get some!

1093
01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:52.962
- Hey.
- Run, Mac! Run!

1094
01:08:54.339 --> 01:08:55.381
- Go, go, go!

1095
01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.645
Spread out!
Find 'em.

1096
01:09:13.066 --> 01:09:15.985
You got Tasers?
Now you can swim?

1097
01:09:15.985 --> 01:09:18.905
All of a sudden you run around
like you're frickin' Batman.

1098
01:09:18.905 --> 01:09:21.199
- Hell yeah.

1099
01:09:21.199 --> 01:09:24.577
After last time,
y'all begged me to come back.

1100
01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:27.622
-"DJ, oh, we family, DJ."

1101
01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:30.541
"DJ, we need you."
Yeah, all right. Bet.

1102
01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:31.959
But I ain't stupid.

1103
01:09:31.959 --> 01:09:33.211
I trained up,
I learned how to fight,

1104
01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.879
I learned how to swim,

1105
01:09:34.879 --> 01:09:36.881
and I will never go anywhere
without my survival pack.

1106
01:09:36.881 --> 01:09:38.466
- Survival pack?
- Yeah.

1107
01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:39.801
Check this out.

1108
01:09:39.801 --> 01:09:41.969
Mmm-hmm. Come here, baby.
Come here.

1109
01:09:41.969 --> 01:09:44.472
Bam.

1110
01:09:44.472 --> 01:09:47.266
Yeah, I even made
poison-tipped bullets,

1111
01:09:47.266 --> 01:09:49.435
just like Jaws 2.

1112
01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:54.690
Come on, DJ!
Let's go, let's go.

1113
01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.362
This is insane.

1114
01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:04.450
Freeze, assholes.

1115
01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:08.663
Yeah, freeze.

1116
01:10:08.663 --> 01:10:09.789
You got this?

1117
01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:16.504
That was some
unfortunate shit back there.

1118
01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.631
No, please!
Don't shoot!

1119
01:10:21.259 --> 01:10:22.844
I know you're
looking for me and Jonas.

1120
01:10:22.844 --> 01:10:24.345
I also know
you don't speak Chinese,

1121
01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:27.223
but I'm speaking it
to distract you guys,

1122
01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.642
because my friend is about
to attack you from behind.

1123
01:10:29.642 --> 01:10:31.060
What?

1124
01:10:36.649 --> 01:10:38.484
- sucker.

1125
01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.614
I thought you were dead.

1126
01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:45.491
- Wishful thinking, Mac.

1127
01:10:45.491 --> 01:10:47.994
If it ain't
the deviated septum.

1128
01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:49.454
- Boat's leaving.

1129
01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:55.084
What's our status?

1130
01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.043
Bravo team
are inbound.

1131
01:10:56.043 --> 01:10:57.128
ETA, ten minutes.

1132
01:10:57.128 --> 01:10:58.212
Excellent.

1133
01:11:00.006 --> 01:11:01.340
Uh, what are you doing here?

1134
01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:06.637
Mmm.

1135
01:11:08.848 --> 01:11:10.766
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1136
01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:14.061
Jonas is on Mana One.

1137
01:11:14.061 --> 01:11:16.939
We need to lock this place
down now.

1138
01:11:19.025 --> 01:11:20.902
Search the station
top to bottom.

1139
01:11:20.902 --> 01:11:22.445
Secure personnel
in their quarters,

1140
01:11:22.445 --> 01:11:23.696
kill anyone else.

1141
01:11:24.322 --> 01:11:26.240
Go! Go!

1142
01:11:33.664 --> 01:11:34.624
Oh, my God.

1143
01:11:39.712 --> 01:11:41.422
Uh, guys?

1144
01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.592
We've got a big problem.

1145
01:11:52.892 --> 01:11:54.393
We tracked three megs

1146
01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:55.853
that escaped
before the breach closed.

1147
01:11:55.853 --> 01:11:57.897
We're gonna need
a good cover story for this.

1148
01:11:57.897 --> 01:11:59.482
Well, that shouldn't be hard.

1149
01:11:59.482 --> 01:12:01.859
Everyone knows Jonas
and Jiuming were reckless.

1150
01:12:01.859 --> 01:12:03.986
No, we need a hero.

1151
01:12:03.986 --> 01:12:05.988
Like, someone to emerge

1152
01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.990
from this
unforeseeable tragedy,

1153
01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:10.117
who can step into
a leadership position

1154
01:12:10.117 --> 01:12:11.452
at the Institute.

1155
01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:15.164
Jess, are you ready
for promotion?

1156
01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:17.667
I appreciate your confidence.

1157
01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:18.918
Jess!

1158
01:12:18.918 --> 01:12:20.169
It's from
the thermocline breach.

1159
01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:21.504
But you can relax.

1160
01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:23.923
This place? Meg-proof.

1161
01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:25.716
I mean, Jonas was
always afraid of this,

1162
01:12:25.716 --> 01:12:27.426
but I think, between trackers
and gunships,

1163
01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:29.470
we can solve the problem
and come out the other side

1164
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:31.472
with a significant positive
PR spin.

1165
01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:33.307
Yeah, I'm on it.

1166
01:12:33.307 --> 01:12:34.350
I was also thinking...

1167
01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:01.877
What now?

1168
01:13:01.877 --> 01:13:03.879
It's our only way off.
We have to take it.

1169
01:13:03.879 --> 01:13:05.131
But that thing
doesn't have the range

1170
01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:07.466
to get us to the mainland.

1171
01:13:07.466 --> 01:13:09.260
You're worried about
the destination?

1172
01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.970
What about
the first hundred yards?

1173
01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:12.680
That's where we goin' die.

1174
01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:14.098
We paddle out slow.

1175
01:13:14.098 --> 01:13:16.559
No engines.
Minimal motion.

1176
01:13:16.559 --> 01:13:18.019
We won't look like food.

1177
01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:20.354
When we're clear,
we make a run for it. Huh?

1178
01:13:20.354 --> 01:13:21.439
Let's do it.

1179
01:13:23.316 --> 01:13:25.276
I still think
we look like food.

1180
01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:27.778
Shh.
Quiet, everyone.

1181
01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:29.280
Paddle slowly.

1182
01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:31.824
This feels
unpleasantly familiar.

1183
01:13:31.824 --> 01:13:34.035
I just hope it goes better
than last time.

1184
01:13:34.952 --> 01:13:35.953
What happened last time?

1185
01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:38.122
You don't wanna know.

1186
01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:45.421
Oh.
Here he comes.

1187
01:13:52.178 --> 01:13:53.304
Go, go, go!

1188
01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:57.350
Let's not
bring 'em back alive.

1189
01:13:58.768 --> 01:14:00.436
You do know how to
drive this thing, right?

1190
01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.820
Stop! Stop the engine
right now.

1191
01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.948
Or you will attract the megs.

1192
01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:17.703
Okay. Be still.

1193
01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:19.497
- No motion whatsoever.

1194
01:14:24.627 --> 01:14:26.003
I have the shot.

1195
01:14:27.421 --> 01:14:28.839
Take it.

1196
01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:30.508
- Get down!
- Mate, do your job.

1197
01:14:30.508 --> 01:14:31.467
- Take the bloody shot.
- It's not easy as it looks.

1198
01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.015
He got 'em!
He ate 'em!

1199
01:14:38.015 --> 01:14:39.308
He ate the whole boat!

1200
01:14:42.353 --> 01:14:44.313
What happened?

1201
01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.440
Jess is dead.

1202
01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:48.067
- What?
- We stabilized Mana One

1203
01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:50.319
but Taylor and Zhang
have escaped.

1204
01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.529
What do you want me to do?

1205
01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.114
Fix it! Kill them!

1206
01:14:53.114 --> 01:14:55.449
You do this,
you write your own ticket.

1207
01:14:55.449 --> 01:14:56.826
You are set for life.

1208
01:14:57.910 --> 01:15:00.037
Okay.

1209
01:15:00.037 --> 01:15:02.373
There's only a couple places
they could make it to.

1210
01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.667
- Are you crying, Montes?

1211
01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:18.347
Any sign of the megs?

1212
01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.850
Negative.

1213
01:15:20.850 --> 01:15:22.893
There's no way
this thing's gonna work.

1214
01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.479
It's gonna work.

1215
01:15:25.479 --> 01:15:27.440
Bloke, you got more chance
of blowing up yourself

1216
01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:29.400
than one of the megs.

1217
01:15:29.400 --> 01:15:31.110
At least I won't get eaten.

1218
01:15:31.110 --> 01:15:33.028
Ha, I hear that.

1219
01:15:33.028 --> 01:15:34.989
Jo, can you make me one?

1220
01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:38.659
I got you covered, Mac.

1221
01:15:38.659 --> 01:15:40.745
We have to find a way
to warn people.

1222
01:15:40.745 --> 01:15:43.164
In case the megs
move towards land.

1223
01:15:43.164 --> 01:15:46.959
There's an island 60 klicks
southeast of us.

1224
01:15:46.959 --> 01:15:49.003
It's listed as inhabited.

1225
01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.880
Inhabited by who?

1226
01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:53.090
The name more or less
translates to...

1227
01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.092
Fun Island.

1228
01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:57.303
Fun Island?

1229
01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:04.185
Yeah!

1230
01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:13.778
Welcome to Fun Island.
Our resort has everything.

1231
01:16:13.778 --> 01:16:16.489
The restaurant, amazing.

1232
01:16:16.489 --> 01:16:18.949
The disco, incredible.

1233
01:16:18.949 --> 01:16:20.743
- And our spa, to die for.
- Oh.

1234
01:16:20.743 --> 01:16:22.787
- Oh.
- OMG.

1235
01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:25.247
It's our special dish.
Seafood Surprise!

1236
01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.833
Wow! I wouldn't know
where to start.

1237
01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.877
Well, just don't miss out
on the grilled shark.

1238
01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:31.587
- Pippin! Pippin!

1239
01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:32.963
Pippin!

1240
01:16:32.963 --> 01:16:34.882
- Whoa, what is that?
- Pippin!

1241
01:16:34.882 --> 01:16:36.425
What are
they running from?

1242
01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:41.347
Your first time
at the rodeo?

1243
01:16:43.015 --> 01:16:45.518
I worked with your dad since
before you were born.

1244
01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:47.019
I never had this kind
of trouble from him.

1245
01:16:47.019 --> 01:16:49.021
Can you put your phone down?

1246
01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:51.524
After all these hard years
we're finally on vacation,

1247
01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:54.068
savor the moment.

1248
01:16:54.068 --> 01:16:55.986
Yeah, and I yelled at him too.

1249
01:16:55.986 --> 01:16:59.281
I've already got 400 likes.

1250
01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:01.909
I'm sitting in paradise

1251
01:17:01.909 --> 01:17:03.786
and you are ruining it!

1252
01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:04.995
Who does that? Who...

1253
01:17:04.995 --> 01:17:06.956
ruins paradise
for other people?

1254
01:17:09.834 --> 01:17:11.544
Hey, baby.

1255
01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:13.170
Wanna rub some oil on my back?

1256
01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:15.923
No?

1257
01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:17.007
How 'bout my front?

1258
01:17:17.675 --> 01:17:18.592
Ew.

1259
01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:25.432
Come over.

1260
01:17:26.517 --> 01:17:27.685
What?

1261
01:17:30.980 --> 01:17:32.565
What are you doing?

1262
01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:39.572
Yaoyao...

1263
01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:43.617
Will you marry me?

1264
01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.416
Find it, idiot!

1265
01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:51.959
Wait!

1266
01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:55.963
Have you found it?

1267
01:17:59.758 --> 01:18:00.801
Hey.

1268
01:18:04.263 --> 01:18:05.431
Yaoyao.

1269
01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.559
Yaoyao.

1270
01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:10.477
- Yaoyao! Yaoyao!

1271
01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:44.887
This doesn't look good.

1272
01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.473
Rigas, get us there fast!

1273
01:18:54.897 --> 01:18:56.565
Kill the cell phone uplink.

1274
01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.745
There's a lot
of exposure for us on this.

1275
01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:11.956
Take care of Jonas
and his team quickly,

1276
01:19:11.956 --> 01:19:13.540
and quietly.

1277
01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:17.753
Everybody
out of the water!

1278
01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.922
- Shark! Shark!
- Get back on the beach!

1279
01:19:19.922 --> 01:19:22.591
- Get out of the water!

1280
01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:23.842
Get back on the beach, every...

1281
01:19:27.304 --> 01:19:28.806
Mobile comms
are down. Over.

1282
01:20:14.101 --> 01:20:15.185
You copy, guys?

1283
01:20:16.770 --> 01:20:19.231
- Crocodile!

1284
01:20:19.231 --> 01:20:20.733
What is that?

1285
01:20:20.733 --> 01:20:22.234
- Move, move!
- Get into the chopper.

1286
01:20:22.234 --> 01:20:23.944
- Now! Go with her!

1287
01:20:28.449 --> 01:20:30.451
Mmm. Mmm.

1288
01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:40.878
Everybody out!

1289
01:20:40.878 --> 01:20:41.962
Shark!

1290
01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:43.047
Shark!

1291
01:20:43.047 --> 01:20:44.089
Go back!

1292
01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:45.049
Don't go into the water!

1293
01:20:45.049 --> 01:20:46.759
There's a shark!

1294
01:20:46.759 --> 01:20:48.052
Get on the beach!

1295
01:20:48.052 --> 01:20:49.303
Go back!

1296
01:20:49.303 --> 01:20:50.763
We have to save them.

1297
01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.973
- I'm not leaving ya.
- Cell phone's down.

1298
01:20:52.973 --> 01:20:54.475
Hello? Hello?

1299
01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:56.018
- No signal.
- There's no choice.

1300
01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.519
- She's right.
- We got no signal, guys.

1301
01:20:57.519 --> 01:20:59.605
Hey, you two!
Find a way to call for help.

1302
01:20:59.605 --> 01:21:01.315
Let everyone know
what happened.

1303
01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:02.524
Come on! Come on!
This way! This way!

1304
01:21:03.734 --> 01:21:04.818
You're gonna hide.

1305
01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:06.445
See that lifeguard tower?

1306
01:21:06.445 --> 01:21:07.863
- Yeah.
- You go there
and you stay there.

1307
01:21:07.863 --> 01:21:09.031
This is not
one of those things

1308
01:21:09.031 --> 01:21:10.449
where I tell you
to do something,

1309
01:21:10.449 --> 01:21:11.784
you say "yes,"

1310
01:21:11.784 --> 01:21:13.077
and then you do
whatever you want.

1311
01:21:13.077 --> 01:21:14.495
Understand?

1312
01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:16.038
Yes.

1313
01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:17.289
You're not messing with me?

1314
01:21:17.289 --> 01:21:18.957
No.

1315
01:21:18.957 --> 01:21:20.959
I can't do what I need to do
if I'm worried about you.

1316
01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:23.545
I'll be fine.

1317
01:21:23.545 --> 01:21:24.963
Promise me
you'll come back.

1318
01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:29.927
You know I love you.

1319
01:22:09.508 --> 01:22:10.592
Oh, shit.

1320
01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:16.849
Sonny.

1321
01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:18.892
- Check that out.

1322
01:22:22.771 --> 01:22:24.314
Hey, yo, my man.
You got a phone?

1323
01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:27.067
What's everyone running from?

1324
01:22:28.485 --> 01:22:30.737
What the hell was that?

1325
01:22:30.737 --> 01:22:31.864
Three megs.

1326
01:22:31.864 --> 01:22:33.031
Three of us.

1327
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:34.575
We each grab a jet ski.

1328
01:22:34.575 --> 01:22:35.826
Get them to chase it away

1329
01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:37.828
from these people
and out to sea.

1330
01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:39.121
Then we harpoon them.

1331
01:22:39.121 --> 01:22:40.706
Oh, you mean
with those jerry-rigged,

1332
01:22:40.706 --> 01:22:43.125
maybe-they-work,
maybe-they-kill-us harpoons?

1333
01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:44.209
Yeah.

1334
01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:45.961
It's a terrible idea.

1335
01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:47.129
You got a better one?

1336
01:22:47.129 --> 01:22:48.338
No. No.

1337
01:22:48.338 --> 01:22:49.965
- Then we're agreed.
- Yeah.

1338
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:51.133
- Good.
- Great.

1339
01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:07.524
Montes!

1340
01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.569
Shit.

1341
01:23:38.639 --> 01:23:40.015
Let's go old school.

1342
01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:48.357
The landline's down, too.

1343
01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.025
Okay, coast is clear.
Let's go.

1344
01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.075
They can walk?

1345
01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:00.619
Shit.

1346
01:24:02.162 --> 01:24:03.497
It's those things.

1347
01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.290
They haven't spotted us yet.

1348
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:08.043
- Okay.

1349
01:24:12.464 --> 01:24:14.049
What else you got in here?

1350
01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.592
Emergency stuff.

1351
01:24:18.178 --> 01:24:19.137
Okay.

1352
01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.977
Really? Condoms?

1353
01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:26.853
Different kind of emergencies.

1354
01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:27.896
Hand me that.

1355
01:24:31.566 --> 01:24:33.110
Now hand me
that gum in your mouth.

1356
01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:36.571
Thank you.

1357
01:24:49.668 --> 01:24:51.253
There's only one ski.

1358
01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:52.379
Give me your harpoons.

1359
01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.215
You sure?

1360
01:24:55.215 --> 01:24:56.133
Oh...

1361
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:02.055
- I got this.
- Good luck.

1362
01:25:03.307 --> 01:25:05.183
We need more firepower.

1363
01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:06.226
Yeah.

1364
01:25:07.978 --> 01:25:10.230
I have an idea.
Let's go.

1365
01:25:19.156 --> 01:25:20.782
Not this time, Taylor.

1366
01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:23.702
Vamos.

1367
01:25:42.429 --> 01:25:43.889
This should be
the place.

1368
01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:47.934
Come on.

1369
01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:55.400
What are we looking for?

1370
01:25:57.194 --> 01:25:58.528
Ammonium nitrate.

1371
01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:01.448
You're making a bomb?

1372
01:26:01.448 --> 01:26:03.909
This stuff is
as powerful as TNT.

1373
01:26:03.909 --> 01:26:05.077
- Hey!

1374
01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:07.162
- Get in! Get in!

1375
01:26:12.376 --> 01:26:13.460
Freeze!

1376
01:26:31.395 --> 01:26:32.312
Come on!

1377
01:27:04.177 --> 01:27:05.095
Come on!

1378
01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:19.693
Come on, let's see
if he's got a phone.

1379
01:27:23.155 --> 01:27:25.115
I got the sat phone.
I got the sat...

1380
01:27:25.115 --> 01:27:26.825
I got the phone.
Why you stealing his money?

1381
01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:28.326
- What? He's not gonna need it.

1382
01:27:28.326 --> 01:27:30.245
Uh-oh.

1383
01:27:30.245 --> 01:27:33.748
- Nice doggies. Nice doggies.

1384
01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:35.125
Okay, Rigas.

1385
01:27:35.125 --> 01:27:37.335
On the count of three,
we're gonna bolt.

1386
01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:39.421
One. Two. Three!

1387
01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:40.797
What the hell? Hey!

1388
01:27:42.007 --> 01:27:44.843
Wait for DJ!
Wait for DJ!

1389
01:27:46.928 --> 01:27:48.930
They're right
behind us!

1390
01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.307
Let's hide in here!

1391
01:27:50.307 --> 01:27:52.350
Come on. Come on.
Come here. Come here.

1392
01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:54.394
- What the hell?
- Hi, DJ. Hi, Rigas.

1393
01:27:54.394 --> 01:27:55.562
- Whoa.
- All of you together.

1394
01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:57.898
Up against the wall.
Hands up!

1395
01:27:57.898 --> 01:27:59.024
I wouldn't point that at me

1396
01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:01.151
if I were you.
Trust me.

1397
01:28:01.151 --> 01:28:03.153
Shut it!
Keep your hands in the air.

1398
01:28:03.153 --> 01:28:04.279
Hands up!

1399
01:28:08.158 --> 01:28:09.951
Don't want to hurt you,

1400
01:28:09.951 --> 01:28:12.496
so I'm going
to give you one chance.

1401
01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:14.289
Put those weapons down.

1402
01:28:14.289 --> 01:28:15.415
Or you'll do what?

1403
01:28:16.708 --> 01:28:18.460
Stay still, little guy.

1404
01:28:24.799 --> 01:28:26.259
No, no! Joe, Joe, door!

1405
01:28:26.259 --> 01:28:28.929
- Stay where you are!

1406
01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:30.639
- Go, go!
- Get to cover!

1407
01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.741
Damn!

1408
01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:54.246
I got signal.

1409
01:28:54.246 --> 01:28:55.539
Call for help!

1410
01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:57.832
To get down to the beach
and help people!

1411
01:28:57.832 --> 01:28:59.292
Where are you going?

1412
01:28:59.292 --> 01:29:01.211
- Stealing a chopper.
- What chopper?

1413
01:29:01.211 --> 01:29:02.462
Global rescue?

1414
01:29:02.462 --> 01:29:03.880
We need rescue!

1415
01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:05.507
We need you to send
everybody you got!

1416
01:29:05.507 --> 01:29:07.175
The National Guard,
the lifeguard,

1417
01:29:07.175 --> 01:29:08.718
the Coast Guard. Anybody!

1418
01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:09.928
Just come now!

1419
01:30:16.661 --> 01:30:18.121
Ugh, looks like
someone else

1420
01:30:18.121 --> 01:30:19.289
- had the same idea.

1421
01:30:20.332 --> 01:30:21.833
We need a plan.

1422
01:30:21.833 --> 01:30:24.169
We have to lead it away
and steal the chopper.

1423
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:27.339
Okay, you lead it away,
I'll steal the chopper.

1424
01:30:27.339 --> 01:30:28.757
You distract it,
I'll get the chopper.

1425
01:30:28.757 --> 01:30:29.924
Why me?

1426
01:30:29.924 --> 01:30:31.176
Can you fly a chopper?

1427
01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:32.469
Yeah, I can.

1428
01:30:32.469 --> 01:30:33.637
- You have a license?
- Yes, I do!

1429
01:30:33.637 --> 01:30:34.929
- I didn't know that.
- What?

1430
01:30:34.929 --> 01:30:36.306
Okay, good plan.

1431
01:30:36.306 --> 01:30:37.349
Mac!

1432
01:31:15.220 --> 01:31:17.597
Jiuming! We gotta go!

1433
01:31:24.396 --> 01:31:26.189
Fuel! Get the fuel!

1434
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:27.232
Gas! We need gas!

1435
01:31:34.489 --> 01:31:35.615
Get up!

1436
01:31:41.121 --> 01:31:42.205
Get the fuel!

1437
01:31:48.753 --> 01:31:50.380
- Lizard incoming! Hold on!

1438
01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.841
- Jiuming? Jiuming!

1439
01:32:03.893 --> 01:32:04.811
Run!

1440
01:32:11.735 --> 01:32:12.652
Go!

1441
01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:17.907
Whoa, yay!

1442
01:32:19.659 --> 01:32:20.660
Man,
I didn't think you were

1443
01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:22.036
gonna make that one.

1444
01:32:31.254 --> 01:32:32.172
Run!

1445
01:32:45.810 --> 01:32:47.896
No.

1446
01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:15.757
Where are you going,
Jonas?

1447
01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.883
Get lower! That's Meiying!

1448
01:33:58.883 --> 01:34:00.343
Are you sure
it's Meiying?

1449
01:34:06.266 --> 01:34:07.350
Get lower!

1450
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:09.269
Okay, okay!
Hold on!

1451
01:34:24.868 --> 01:34:25.952
Meiying!

1452
01:34:27.745 --> 01:34:28.705
Over here!

1453
01:34:31.833 --> 01:34:32.750
Leap up!

1454
01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:57.210
Jonas is still alive?

1455
01:35:57.210 --> 01:35:58.962
Get me over there!

1456
01:36:05.051 --> 01:36:06.844
Help!

1457
01:36:06.844 --> 01:36:08.179
Hang on, Meiying!

1458
01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:25.780
Taylor!

1459
01:36:29.450 --> 01:36:30.910
Come on!

1460
01:36:33.955 --> 01:36:36.249
Come out from under
the bridge, little troll!

1461
01:37:00.273 --> 01:37:02.150
End of the line, no?

1462
01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:03.234
I guess it is.

1463
01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:05.695
You got the gun.

1464
01:37:10.575 --> 01:37:11.576
I won't be needing this.

1465
01:37:15.204 --> 01:37:17.248
I knew you couldn't do it.

1466
01:37:20.334 --> 01:37:21.794
See you later, chum.

1467
01:37:26.799 --> 01:37:27.800
Jiu!

1468
01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:31.596
Meiying!

1469
01:37:31.596 --> 01:37:33.389
Throw me the bomb!

1470
01:37:33.389 --> 01:37:34.390
Where?

1471
01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:37.226
Catch it!

1472
01:39:08.568 --> 01:39:10.945
Hold on! I'm coming!

1473
01:39:14.657 --> 01:39:15.783
Meiying!

1474
01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:18.703
Meiying!

1475
01:39:18.703 --> 01:39:19.871
- Jonas! Over here!

1476
01:39:21.038 --> 01:39:22.623
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1477
01:39:22.623 --> 01:39:24.041
Uncle Jiuming
and Mac's in trouble.

1478
01:39:29.297 --> 01:39:30.756
Stay here.
I'll be right back.

1479
01:39:39.891 --> 01:39:41.350
Mac! Are you okay?

1480
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:42.393
- Mac?

1481
01:40:39.533 --> 01:40:41.327
Come on,
you ugly bastard!

1482
01:41:38.634 --> 01:41:40.344
Come on, come on, come on!

1483
01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:41.762
Come on, come on. I got you,
I got you. Come on, come on!

1484
01:41:41.762 --> 01:41:43.639
Come on!
Watch, watch, watch it!

1485
01:41:43.639 --> 01:41:45.349
Come on, come on, come on!

1486
01:41:47.935 --> 01:41:50.021
Meiying,
what are you doing here?

1487
01:41:50.021 --> 01:41:51.230
I had to save the dog!

1488
01:41:51.856 --> 01:41:53.232
What?

1489
01:41:53.232 --> 01:41:54.567
- Mommy's here.

1490
01:41:54.567 --> 01:41:56.319
- Thank you! Thank you!
- You're welcome.

1491
01:42:01.699 --> 01:42:02.742
Oh, no, you don't!

1492
01:42:02.742 --> 01:42:03.993
Meiying! Come!

1493
01:42:12.835 --> 01:42:13.794
Hell yeah!

1494
01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:15.755
Get some!

1495
01:42:15.755 --> 01:42:18.674
Who says a .50 caliber
is an impractical round?

1496
01:42:23.888 --> 01:42:25.598
Hey! Wait, wait, wait!

1497
01:42:25.598 --> 01:42:27.725
Everyone stay still.
No motion.

1498
01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:31.187
No, it's okay.

1499
01:42:31.187 --> 01:42:32.688
That's Haiqi.

1500
01:42:32.688 --> 01:42:34.106
Who cares which one it is?

1501
01:42:35.107 --> 01:42:36.567
She'll listen to me.

1502
01:42:36.567 --> 01:42:38.527
Let's spread out so that thing
don't get us all.

1503
01:42:38.527 --> 01:42:39.570
I got this!

1504
01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:14.814
Yes! I knew it!

1505
01:43:14.814 --> 01:43:17.400
I told you!
We have a special bond.

1506
01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:20.319
- It went after the dolphins.
- No!

1507
01:43:20.319 --> 01:43:21.946
She obeyed my command.

1508
01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:24.698
Ridiculous.

1509
01:43:24.698 --> 01:43:27.118
I didn't believe it before
and I don't believe it now.

1510
01:43:27.118 --> 01:43:28.828
Hey, Mac,
back me up.

1511
01:43:28.828 --> 01:43:30.538
I'm getting out of here
before she changes her mind.

1512
01:43:31.997 --> 01:43:33.207
Mac!

1513
01:43:33.207 --> 01:43:35.042
You guys stay there
and argue.

1514
01:43:35.042 --> 01:43:36.710
She obeyed my command!

1515
01:43:38.170 --> 01:43:39.755
- Dolphins.
- No!

1516
01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:48.055
It's not my fault.

1517
01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:49.265
Sometimes, there's a situation,

1518
01:43:49.265 --> 01:43:50.433
and bad things
are happening,

1519
01:43:50.433 --> 01:43:52.017
and you just have
to get involved.

1520
01:43:53.727 --> 01:43:55.354
I'm glad
you finally understand.

1521
01:43:57.731 --> 01:43:58.774
I'm proud of you.

1522
01:44:02.111 --> 01:44:03.654
Next time
don't run around, ok?

1523
01:44:07.533 --> 01:44:10.619
Rescue One
to Fun Island. Over.

1524
01:44:10.619 --> 01:44:12.663
Oh, it's good
to hear your voice, man.

1525
01:44:12.663 --> 01:44:14.832
We got a lot of people
who need help.

1526
01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:20.463
Yeah,
I used to didn't know

1527
01:44:20.463 --> 01:44:21.547
how to swim,
but then, you know,

1528
01:44:21.547 --> 01:44:22.798
you out there chasing sharks,

1529
01:44:22.798 --> 01:44:24.133
you better learn
how to swim quick!

1530
01:44:25.801 --> 01:44:27.470
The water was cold. It wasn't
that cold, but yeah,

1531
01:44:27.470 --> 01:44:29.305
- I was just having fun!
- What about Haiqi?

1532
01:44:30.264 --> 01:44:31.640
She's still out there.

1533
01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.100
- Maybe pregnant.
- ...lucky to be alive, baby.

1534
01:44:33.100 --> 01:44:33.976
- Oh, preferably not.
- Know what's crazy?

1535
01:44:33.976 --> 01:44:35.102
Like, a few years ago...

1536
01:44:35.102 --> 01:44:36.395
That's tomorrow.

1537
01:44:36.395 --> 01:44:39.398
Today, we count our blessings.

1538
01:44:39.398 --> 01:44:40.691
Here's to being alive.

1539
01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:44.278
Here's to dolphins.

1540
01:44:44.278 --> 01:44:47.656
- To Meiying being safe.

1541
01:44:47.656 --> 01:44:49.533
And here's to Sal,
Lance, and Curtis.

1542
01:44:52.912 --> 01:44:54.246
So...

1543
01:44:54.246 --> 01:44:55.456
am I still grounded?

1544
01:44:58.959 --> 01:45:00.336
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

1545
01:45:06.091 --> 01:45:07.593
You two are ridiculous.

1546
01:45:09.470 --> 01:45:10.596
But I love you anyway.

1547
01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.473
Mmm.

1548
01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:17.895
Looks like you got
a little reckless out there.

1549
01:45:17.895 --> 01:45:20.898
No, everything
was totally under control.

1550
01:45:20.898 --> 01:45:22.691
- Yeah, right.

1551
01:45:22.691 --> 01:45:25.277
Well, everything's about to be
totally not under control.

1552
01:45:27.238 --> 01:45:28.280
Give me some.

1553
01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:34.036
Mmm.

1554
01:45:34.036 --> 01:45:36.038
