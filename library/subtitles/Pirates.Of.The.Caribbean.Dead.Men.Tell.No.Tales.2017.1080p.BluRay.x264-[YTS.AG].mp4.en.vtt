00:03:34.591 --> 00:03:35.592
Father?

00:03:35.758 --> 00:03:38.595
Henry,
what have you done?

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:40.096
I said I'd find you.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.932
Look at me, son.

00:03:45.518 --> 00:03:46.853
I don't care.

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.772
There's no place for you
on the <i>Dutchman.</i>

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.444
They know you're here.

00:03:54.944 --> 00:03:55.945
Get home to your mother.

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:56.863
No!

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:58.281
Leave now!

00:03:59.115 --> 00:04:00.116
Before it's too late.

00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:02.535
I won't! I'll never stop.

00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:05.914
And if you throw me over,
I'll come straight back.

00:04:07.624 --> 00:04:09.104
Don't you see
I'm cursed to this ship?

00:04:09.626 --> 00:04:10.710
That's why I'm here.

00:04:10.877 --> 00:04:12.754
I think I know a way
to break your curse.

00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:14.130
To free you from the <i>Dutchman.</i>

00:04:14.297 --> 00:04:15.798
Henry, no.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.109
I've read about a treasure.

00:04:17.133 --> 00:04:19.427
A treasure that holds
all the power of the sea.

00:04:19.594 --> 00:04:22.138
The Trident of Poseidon
can break your curse.

00:04:25.308 --> 00:04:29.395
Henry, the Trident
can never be found.

00:04:30.313 --> 00:04:31.773
I found you.

00:04:32.565 --> 00:04:33.942
It's just a tale.

00:04:34.442 --> 00:04:36.611
Like the tales of you
and Captain Jack Sparrow?

00:04:37.153 --> 00:04:38.613
He will help me
find the Trident.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.823
You stay away from Jack.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.533
Leave the sea forever.

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:43.761
You have to stop
acting like...

00:04:43.785 --> 00:04:44.953
A pirate?

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:47.163
I won't stop.

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.749
I want you to come home.

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:58.132
Henry...

00:04:58.257 --> 00:04:59.842
I'm sorry.

00:05:01.427 --> 00:05:03.429
But my curse
will never be broken.

00:05:05.932 --> 00:05:08.184
This is my fate.

00:05:08.351 --> 00:05:11.145
You must let me go.

00:05:16.693 --> 00:05:18.820
I love you, son.

00:05:46.556 --> 00:05:49.267
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:10.038
Keep even keel.

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:12.749
Haul in on the lee side!

00:06:12.915 --> 00:06:15.918
Faster,
you pathetic bilge rats!

00:06:16.085 --> 00:06:18.755
You'll pump the bilge
and fill the scuppers.

00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:20.840
We're chasing down pirates!

00:06:21.007 --> 00:06:22.759
Henry, get back here.

00:06:22.925 --> 00:06:24.761
You don't wanna get kicked off
another ship.

00:06:24.927 --> 00:06:26.137
It's a Dutch barque.

00:06:26.304 --> 00:06:28.181
Probably stolen
by the Pirate Bonnet.

00:06:37.398 --> 00:06:38.399
My God.

00:06:39.233 --> 00:06:41.194
I warned you
of leaving your post, boy.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.629
I need to speak
with the captain.

00:06:42.653 --> 00:06:43.946
- What did you say?
- Move!

00:06:44.113 --> 00:06:45.740
Turner!

00:06:52.246 --> 00:06:53.748
She's going in, sir.

00:06:55.374 --> 00:06:56.459
Chase her down.

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:02.632
No, don't do it.

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.258
Don't do it!

00:07:04.342 --> 00:07:06.636
You will
not address the captain, boy.

00:07:06.803 --> 00:07:08.012
Sir, look at your charts.

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:10.299
I believe you're sailing us
into the Devil's Triangle.

00:07:10.389 --> 00:07:11.724
You hear this, men?

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:14.435
This landsman believes
an old sailor's myth.

00:07:15.353 --> 00:07:16.521
Sir, with all due respect,

00:07:16.604 --> 00:07:18.540
I have spent my life studying
the myths of the sea.

00:07:18.564 --> 00:07:20.149
I know every legend
and every curse.

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:22.370
And I know ships that
sail into the Triangle

00:07:22.485 --> 00:07:23.629
do not necessarily sail out...

00:07:23.653 --> 00:07:27.115
I'm sorry, sir.
This one is clearly disturbed.

00:07:27.281 --> 00:07:29.784
Sir, trust in what I say.
Change your course.

00:07:29.951 --> 00:07:31.828
You dare
to give me orders, boy?

00:07:31.994 --> 00:07:32.994
Arrest him!

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.872
Turner!

00:07:34.956 --> 00:07:36.436
I will not
let you kill us all.

00:07:54.976 --> 00:07:56.811
This is treason.

00:07:58.688 --> 00:07:59.355
No.

00:07:59.522 --> 00:08:01.607
- Lock him up. We're going in!
- No!

00:08:01.774 --> 00:08:04.360
Belay that starboard brace.

00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:06.195
Bind that line!

00:08:06.362 --> 00:08:07.562
Stay to the chains!

00:08:08.114 --> 00:08:10.366
This was
your last chance, Turner.

00:08:13.035 --> 00:08:14.078
If it were up to me,

00:08:14.203 --> 00:08:16.164
I'd string you
from the yardarm.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:17.373
On deck.

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:25.173
Hold steady,
helmsman!

00:08:26.215 --> 00:08:28.676
Jack Sparrow.

00:08:28.843 --> 00:08:30.052
He's dead.

00:08:30.219 --> 00:08:33.890
Buried in an unmarked grave
on the Isle of Saint Martin.

00:09:05.213 --> 00:09:07.506
Sir,
there's something in the water.

00:09:09.217 --> 00:09:10.635
Ship to starboard!

00:09:12.803 --> 00:09:16.599
That's no ship, sir.
It's a shipwreck.

00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:27.568
No.

00:09:28.069 --> 00:09:29.779
She's sailing
straight toward us.

00:09:30.905 --> 00:09:32.031
Open fire!

00:09:33.741 --> 00:09:35.159
Open fire!

00:09:36.994 --> 00:09:38.079
Reload!

00:09:55.429 --> 00:09:56.764
Secure the deck!

00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:52.862
What are you?

00:10:59.201 --> 00:11:00.953
Death.

00:11:54.882 --> 00:11:56.759
Jack Sparrow.

00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:57.843
Shh!

00:12:02.431 --> 00:12:04.183
Do you know this pirate?

00:12:05.476 --> 00:12:07.061
Only by name.

00:12:07.228 --> 00:12:08.604
You're looking for him?

00:12:16.195 --> 00:12:17.488
Is that a "yes"?

00:12:18.114 --> 00:12:19.365
Yes.

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:23.327
For too many years,
the Triangle has cursed us...

00:12:23.494 --> 00:12:26.622
condemned us
to this hell on Earth.

00:12:26.789 --> 00:12:30.501
The key to our escape
is Jack Sparrow...

00:12:30.668 --> 00:12:32.670
and the compass
which he holds.

00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:35.423
No need to fear me, boy.

00:12:35.589 --> 00:12:38.676
I always leave one man alive
to tell the tale.

00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:42.346
Find Sparrow for me...

00:12:42.513 --> 00:12:45.808
and relay a message
from Captain Salazar.

00:12:45.975 --> 00:12:47.435
Salazar.

00:12:48.936 --> 00:12:53.274
Tell him I will behold
the daylight again.

00:12:53.441 --> 00:12:55.609
And on that day...

00:13:00.156 --> 00:13:01.991
death...

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.495
death will come
straight for him.

00:13:06.662 --> 00:13:08.581
Would you say that to him?

00:13:08.747 --> 00:13:09.582
Please?

00:13:09.748 --> 00:13:10.499
Yes.

00:13:10.666 --> 00:13:13.252
I wish I could
do it myself, but...

00:13:14.295 --> 00:13:16.630
dead men tell no tales.

00:13:45.034 --> 00:13:48.537
<i>Carina Smyth, you're
an orphan born of the devil...</i>

00:13:48.954 --> 00:13:51.499
accused of
practising witchcraft.

00:13:51.665 --> 00:13:52.958
Before you die...

00:13:53.584 --> 00:13:55.836
do you have anything
to confess?

00:13:58.088 --> 00:14:00.925
I confess that
I'm not a witch,

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:02.801
that I am a woman of science.

00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:05.763
I confess that
I have survived on my own...

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:09.475
with nothing but a diary from
the father I never knew...

00:14:09.642 --> 00:14:12.186
and a quest for the truth
of who I am.

00:14:12.353 --> 00:14:16.148
I confess that I will die
before I give up the search.

00:14:16.315 --> 00:14:17.900
And I confess...

00:14:18.692 --> 00:14:21.946
that while we've been talking,
I picked this lock.

00:14:29.036 --> 00:14:33.707
Today, we dedicate
the Royal Bank of Saint Martin.

00:14:39.296 --> 00:14:43.592
The most secure banking
institution in the Caribbean.

00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:55.479
Our new vault
is five inches thick...

00:14:55.646 --> 00:14:57.773
and weighs an imperial ton.

00:14:58.607 --> 00:15:00.192
I've got her! I've got her!

00:15:00.568 --> 00:15:01.569
Get her!

00:15:01.735 --> 00:15:04.905
Don't let her get away!
Stop that witch!

00:15:07.575 --> 00:15:10.536
Stop her! She's there!
Get out of the way!

00:15:10.744 --> 00:15:11.954
Get out of my way!

00:15:13.289 --> 00:15:14.748
With this bank...

00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:19.587
the town of Saint Martin
enters the modern world.

00:15:25.467 --> 00:15:28.262
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- The witch escaped her chains.

00:15:29.013 --> 00:15:32.308
Find that wicked lass,
or you'll swing in her place.

00:15:32.641 --> 00:15:33.642
Sir.

00:15:34.018 --> 00:15:35.102
Sir.

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.315
No man nor an army...

00:15:39.481 --> 00:15:43.652
can ever rob the gold
from Saint Martin.

00:15:44.361 --> 00:15:46.572
Open the vault.

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:02.087
Pirate!

00:16:02.796 --> 00:16:04.840
Pirates.

00:16:05.591 --> 00:16:06.842
Pirate!

00:16:18.729 --> 00:16:19.730
Hmm.

00:16:22.358 --> 00:16:24.652
This may seem
a peculiar request...

00:16:24.818 --> 00:16:28.906
but could someone explain
to me as to why I'm here?

00:16:33.994 --> 00:16:35.245
Scrum.

00:16:37.873 --> 00:16:38.874
How long?

00:16:40.167 --> 00:16:41.807
No, wait,
it's coming to me.

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:44.797
I need just a moment
to clear me head.

00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:47.174
Make ready!

00:16:47.466 --> 00:16:48.467
Present!

00:16:52.221 --> 00:16:53.221
Hold your fire!

00:16:53.806 --> 00:16:55.808
There's a woman with him
in the vault!

00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:01.730
Never mind about that trollop.

00:17:01.897 --> 00:17:05.359
Sir, I believe
that's your wife.

00:17:11.073 --> 00:17:12.157
Frances?

00:17:14.284 --> 00:17:15.786
Right, I've got it.

00:17:17.621 --> 00:17:19.873
I've got it!
I'm robbing the bank!

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.000
- Shoot him!
- Ooh!

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.380
Come on!

00:17:28.132 --> 00:17:29.132
Pull!

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:36.390
Pull!

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:38.766
Come on!

00:18:07.546 --> 00:18:09.590
That was not part of the plan.

00:18:11.633 --> 00:18:13.552
After him!
Don't let him get away!

00:18:19.641 --> 00:18:21.894
Yo! Come on!

00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:36.116
Oh, oh!

00:18:50.881 --> 00:18:52.233
Well,
I got this mutton, didn't I?

00:18:52.257 --> 00:18:53.717
Oh,
that was too expensive.

00:19:12.903 --> 00:19:15.614
No woman's ever
handled my Herschel.

00:19:23.914 --> 00:19:25.207
Clear a path!

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:28.377
Oh, no, no, no!

00:19:31.171 --> 00:19:32.881
Stop! Stop! Stop!

00:19:36.718 --> 00:19:38.011
Get inside!

00:19:45.561 --> 00:19:46.728
Hard to starboard.

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:05.330
<i>Sir.</i>

00:20:05.455 --> 00:20:07.082
Your celestial fix was off.

00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:08.709
I've adjusted
two degrees North.

00:20:08.792 --> 00:20:10.627
Your map will
no longer be imprecise.

00:20:10.794 --> 00:20:12.564
Although you will
have to start again with it.

00:20:12.588 --> 00:20:13.588
You're a witch.

00:20:13.839 --> 00:20:15.090
No, I'm not.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:18.260
Am I a witch for having
catalogued over 200 stars?

00:20:18.427 --> 00:20:19.427
Witch!

00:20:21.346 --> 00:20:22.848
There is a blood moon coming.

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:27.185
I simply need to
purchase a chronometer.

00:20:27.895 --> 00:20:29.575
I'll pay you double
for selling to a woman.

00:20:29.688 --> 00:20:30.688
Help!

00:20:31.773 --> 00:20:33.275
There's a witch in my shop!

00:20:33.692 --> 00:20:34.692
Help!

00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.654
Help! There's a witch
in my shop!

00:20:39.489 --> 00:20:42.951
And a pirate! There's a witch
and a pirate in my shop!

00:20:43.118 --> 00:20:45.120
Well, it's your lucky day!

00:20:45.287 --> 00:20:47.706
Have either of the four of you
seen my bank?

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.002
Found it!

00:20:55.756 --> 00:20:57.299
Were you part of the plan?

00:20:57.466 --> 00:20:58.800
I'm not looking for trouble.

00:20:58.967 --> 00:21:00.969
What a horrible way to live.

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:10.252
Stop that witch!
Get her!

00:21:10.729 --> 00:21:12.814
We're trapped. What do we do?

00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:14.501
Yeah, there she is! Quickly!

00:21:16.026 --> 00:21:17.861
You need to scream.

00:21:20.656 --> 00:21:22.699
Over there!
Secure that woman!

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:26.078
You filthy pirate!

00:21:26.244 --> 00:21:28.163
No need for name-calling!

00:21:40.175 --> 00:21:41.343
Come on, lads!

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:05.700
Jack!

00:22:06.535 --> 00:22:07.536
Huh?

00:22:11.206 --> 00:22:12.206
Bridge?

00:22:47.284 --> 00:22:48.285
It's empty!

00:22:49.578 --> 00:22:50.578
Where is the dosh?

00:22:50.662 --> 00:22:53.081
Do you think that
robbing a bank is easy?

00:22:53.248 --> 00:22:56.084
You gaggle of gutless
heels of the womb's guilty...

00:22:56.251 --> 00:22:59.296
of putting me in this dreadful
pickle in the first place.

00:22:59.463 --> 00:23:01.423
Now line up
and offer me your tribute.

00:23:02.466 --> 00:23:04.092
You want us to pay you?

00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:06.595
Am I not the captain
of this ship?

00:23:07.262 --> 00:23:09.473
You call this a ship?

00:23:09.639 --> 00:23:11.016
Where's the treasure?

00:23:11.183 --> 00:23:12.642
All of us are starving.

00:23:12.809 --> 00:23:15.270
We will no longer follow
a captain without a ship.

00:23:15.437 --> 00:23:17.105
I have a ship.

00:23:18.482 --> 00:23:20.525
<i>Black Pearl</i> has
never left me side.

00:23:21.735 --> 00:23:24.946
The pirate Barbossa
rules these seas now.

00:23:25.113 --> 00:23:27.616
Has 10 ships, guns full.

00:23:27.783 --> 00:23:29.284
Not to mention
his cannonballs.

00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:31.286
18 pounds each they say.

00:23:31.453 --> 00:23:32.829
One-legged man
with 18 pound balls?

00:23:33.955 --> 00:23:35.624
That's why he walks funny.

00:23:35.874 --> 00:23:37.417
Oh, come, come, mates.

00:23:37.584 --> 00:23:39.836
Did we not find the Treasure
of Macedonia together?

00:23:40.337 --> 00:23:41.588
It was a troll of rotten wood.

00:23:41.755 --> 00:23:43.632
- Gold of King Midas.
- Pile of donkey dung.

00:23:43.799 --> 00:23:45.634
Face it, Jack.

00:23:45.801 --> 00:23:47.844
Bad luck dogs you
day and night.

00:23:48.011 --> 00:23:51.056
Now that is
a blatant fabrication.

00:23:55.477 --> 00:23:56.812
You've lost your luck.

00:23:56.978 --> 00:23:58.230
You've lost your ship.

00:23:58.396 --> 00:24:01.650
Now, you've lost your crew.

00:24:01.817 --> 00:24:04.611
Jack Sparrow is
no longer our captain.

00:24:08.657 --> 00:24:10.492
I'm sorry, Jack.

00:24:10.659 --> 00:24:13.161
But we've reached
the end of the horizon.

00:24:24.339 --> 00:24:25.590
Right then.

00:24:26.883 --> 00:24:29.010
You're all dismissed. Eh?

00:24:29.177 --> 00:24:31.721
All of ya, dismissed.

00:24:31.888 --> 00:24:34.349
You'll never sail with
Captain Jack Sparrow again,

00:24:34.432 --> 00:24:35.433
tell you that.

00:25:23.106 --> 00:25:25.150
The whole town
speaks of you.

00:25:25.317 --> 00:25:27.444
The only survivor
of the <i>Monarch.</i>

00:25:27.611 --> 00:25:29.571
A boy who paddled
all the way to Saint Martin

00:25:29.654 --> 00:25:31.990
against the tide
on a piece of driftwood.

00:25:32.157 --> 00:25:36.745
Found jabbering about pirates
and tridents.

00:25:37.412 --> 00:25:39.247
Please, sir,
let me go of these chains.

00:25:39.414 --> 00:25:42.834
My job is to protect
this island and these waters.

00:25:43.251 --> 00:25:45.587
And your sleeves
have been ripped.

00:25:47.172 --> 00:25:48.340
The mark of treason.

00:25:48.506 --> 00:25:49.758
We were attacked
by the dead...

00:25:49.925 --> 00:25:51.927
You're a coward
who ran from battle.

00:25:52.344 --> 00:25:54.471
And that is how you'll die.

00:26:05.982 --> 00:26:08.026
I don't believe
you're a coward.

00:26:08.193 --> 00:26:09.611
Please leave me, sister.

00:26:09.945 --> 00:26:12.030
I've risked my life
to come here,

00:26:12.113 --> 00:26:13.782
to see if the rumours are true.

00:26:13.949 --> 00:26:15.450
You speak of the Trident?

00:26:16.451 --> 00:26:17.452
Who are you?

00:26:17.619 --> 00:26:19.829
Tell me why you seek
the Trident.

00:26:21.539 --> 00:26:23.959
The Trident can break
any curse at sea.

00:26:25.543 --> 00:26:27.295
My father is trapped
by such a curse.

00:26:27.462 --> 00:26:29.798
You're aware that curses
are not supported by science.

00:26:29.965 --> 00:26:31.049
Neither are ghosts.

00:26:31.591 --> 00:26:34.135
So you have gone mad?
I should never have come here.

00:26:34.302 --> 00:26:35.804
Then why did you come here?

00:26:35.971 --> 00:26:38.014
Because I need to
get off this island.

00:26:38.181 --> 00:26:40.558
- To solve <i>The Map No Man...
- No Man Can Read.</i>

00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:42.811
Left by Poseidon himself.

00:26:44.646 --> 00:26:46.523
You've read the ancient text?

00:26:46.690 --> 00:26:49.192
In each language
they were written.

00:26:50.694 --> 00:26:54.030
But this map has never been
seen nor read by any man.

00:26:54.489 --> 00:26:56.825
Luckily, I'm a woman.

00:26:59.744 --> 00:27:02.872
This is the diary
of Galileo Galilei.

00:27:03.039 --> 00:27:05.583
He spent his life
searching for the Trident.

00:27:05.750 --> 00:27:07.419
It's why he invented
the spyglass...

00:27:07.585 --> 00:27:09.065
why astronomers have
spent their lives

00:27:09.129 --> 00:27:10.171
staring into the sky.

00:27:11.673 --> 00:27:14.217
So you're saying
<i>The Map No Man Can Read</i>

00:27:14.301 --> 00:27:15.427
is hidden in the stars?

00:27:16.052 --> 00:27:17.512
It was left to me
by my father.

00:27:17.679 --> 00:27:20.974
He believed I could find
what no man has ever found

00:27:21.057 --> 00:27:23.059
and I will not let him down.

00:27:23.226 --> 00:27:25.854
Soon there will be
a blood moon.

00:27:26.021 --> 00:27:28.273
Only then can the map be read.

00:27:28.857 --> 00:27:30.358
And the Trident found.

00:27:31.026 --> 00:27:32.026
Who are you?

00:27:32.068 --> 00:27:34.362
Carina Smyth.

00:27:34.529 --> 00:27:35.840
If you wish
to save your father,

00:27:35.864 --> 00:27:36.865
you'll have to save me.

00:27:37.032 --> 00:27:39.034
Find us a ship
and the Trident will be ours.

00:27:41.036 --> 00:27:43.038
Turn to me, witch.

00:27:46.791 --> 00:27:48.001
Hold.

00:27:55.091 --> 00:27:56.593
He's gone!

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.636
He's gone, sir!

00:28:01.264 --> 00:28:03.058
Find that coward.

00:28:03.224 --> 00:28:04.726
He'll hang with the witch.

00:28:04.809 --> 00:28:05.810
Move out!

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:10.148
Think
Captain Jack's washed up, eh?

00:28:10.899 --> 00:28:14.069
I've not had a wash in years.

00:28:17.739 --> 00:28:19.139
Check the alley down there.

00:28:19.324 --> 00:28:21.826
You two, check the church.
The rest of you, with me.

00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:30.250
Bugger.

00:28:50.438 --> 00:28:52.148
May I please have a drink,
please?

00:28:52.941 --> 00:28:54.109
Show me your silver.

00:28:54.275 --> 00:28:56.027
Silver?

00:29:02.325 --> 00:29:04.035
How about a trade?

00:29:06.663 --> 00:29:08.206
Give me the bottle.

00:30:03.261 --> 00:30:06.347
<i>Capitán,</i> what's happening?

00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:12.854
Jack Sparrow.

00:30:13.021 --> 00:30:15.356
Jack Sparrow has given away
the compass.

00:30:27.702 --> 00:30:29.871
Daylight. Daylight.

00:30:46.638 --> 00:30:48.389
We are free!

00:30:55.897 --> 00:31:00.235
Now, now.
It's time to hunt a pirate.

00:31:07.575 --> 00:31:09.244
Pirate's life.

00:31:19.128 --> 00:31:20.380
Come to daddy. Oh!

00:31:21.506 --> 00:31:23.258
Just the man
we've been looking for.

00:31:23.424 --> 00:31:25.176
Why?
Why am I looked for?

00:31:25.343 --> 00:31:27.845
Let it be known
that the pirate, Jack Sparrow,

00:31:27.929 --> 00:31:29.973
will be executed at dawn.

00:31:30.139 --> 00:31:31.432
Executed?

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:34.936
I will never set foot
in this town again, sir.

00:31:35.103 --> 00:31:36.145
You mark my words.

00:31:36.312 --> 00:31:37.647
Dead now, you cur.

00:31:37.814 --> 00:31:39.357
I do mean it, you know.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.609
I shall never be
back here again.

00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:11.532
Huh.

00:33:23.002 --> 00:33:24.682
"To release the power
of the sea...

00:33:25.588 --> 00:33:27.215
"all must divide."

00:33:31.302 --> 00:33:32.887
It's an island.

00:33:33.221 --> 00:33:35.390
The stars lead to an island.

00:33:45.733 --> 00:33:47.318
Look right here, sir.

00:33:47.485 --> 00:33:49.737
Very good.
Take the rest to the cells.

00:33:51.989 --> 00:33:53.658
I'm looking for a pirate.
Jack Sparrow.

00:33:53.825 --> 00:33:55.159
Bugger off.

00:33:58.830 --> 00:34:01.582
Psst. I need to speak with you.

00:34:07.088 --> 00:34:08.423
Hand me your sword.

00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:09.590
I don't have a sword.

00:34:09.757 --> 00:34:11.676
What kind of soldier
has no weapon?

00:34:11.843 --> 00:34:13.678
I'm currently wanted
for treason.

00:34:14.804 --> 00:34:16.305
So not the very good
kind then.

00:34:16.472 --> 00:34:19.308
I'm looking for a pirate.
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:34:20.101 --> 00:34:21.686
Well, today is your lucky day.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:28.276
'Cause I just happen to be
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:34:32.739 --> 00:34:34.532
No, it can't be.

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:37.452
I've spent years
searching for... this?

00:34:37.952 --> 00:34:40.788
The great Jack Sparrow
is not some drunk in a cell.

00:34:41.205 --> 00:34:43.958
Do you even have a ship?
A crew?

00:34:45.293 --> 00:34:46.544
Pants?

00:34:47.128 --> 00:34:49.839
A great pirate does not
require such intricacies.

00:34:50.006 --> 00:34:52.300
Do you know how long I've been
waiting for this moment?

00:34:52.467 --> 00:34:54.510
The risks I've taken
to be here.

00:34:54.677 --> 00:34:56.220
Are you sure
you're the Jack Sparrow?

00:34:56.387 --> 00:34:58.806
Real question is, who are you?

00:34:58.973 --> 00:35:00.558
My name is Henry Turner.

00:35:00.725 --> 00:35:02.602
Son of Will Turner
and Elizabeth Swann.

00:35:02.685 --> 00:35:03.728
Ugh!

00:35:03.936 --> 00:35:05.980
You're the evil spawn
of them two?

00:35:06.856 --> 00:35:08.900
Does mommy ever ask about me?

00:35:09.066 --> 00:35:09.817
No.

00:35:09.984 --> 00:35:10.985
Oh, go on.

00:35:11.486 --> 00:35:13.321
She call my name in her sleep?

00:35:13.488 --> 00:35:15.031
She never spoke of you.

00:35:15.823 --> 00:35:18.159
Are you sure we're talking
about the same people?

00:35:18.326 --> 00:35:19.827
He's a cursed eunuch.

00:35:19.994 --> 00:35:23.748
She's golden-haired,
stubborn, pouty lips.

00:35:23.915 --> 00:35:27.251
Neck like a giraffe.
And two of those wonderful...

00:35:27.418 --> 00:35:29.378
Yes! Yes, it's her.

00:35:30.838 --> 00:35:32.131
I need you to listen, Jack,

00:35:32.256 --> 00:35:34.175
because at the moment
you're all I've got.

00:35:34.342 --> 00:35:36.344
I found a way
to save my father.

00:35:36.511 --> 00:35:38.191
There is one thing
that can break his curse

00:35:38.262 --> 00:35:39.680
and free him
from the <i>Dutchman.</i>

00:35:41.933 --> 00:35:43.267
The Trident of Poseidon.

00:35:43.768 --> 00:35:45.019
Ah.

00:35:45.603 --> 00:35:50.441
The treasure to be found with
<i>The Map That No Man Can Read.</i>

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.403
Never heard of it.

00:35:55.571 --> 00:35:57.698
There is a girl
inside this prison, Jack,

00:35:57.865 --> 00:35:58.866
who holds that map.

00:35:59.033 --> 00:36:01.702
The moon has turned to blood,
the Trident will be found...

00:36:01.869 --> 00:36:03.555
and you could be the one
who holds the sea...

00:36:03.579 --> 00:36:05.581
and with it become
all that you once were.

00:36:05.748 --> 00:36:07.583
The great...

00:36:08.751 --> 00:36:09.751
Jack!

00:36:10.753 --> 00:36:12.713
I'm so sorry.
Were you still talking?

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:14.382
I believe I nodded off a bit.

00:36:15.716 --> 00:36:17.051
One more thing.

00:36:17.218 --> 00:36:18.719
A message from
someone you know,

00:36:18.803 --> 00:36:20.221
named Captain Salazar.

00:36:23.391 --> 00:36:25.560
I once knew
a Spaniard named...

00:36:26.477 --> 00:36:28.312
something in Spanish.

00:36:30.565 --> 00:36:31.691
The Butcher of the Sea.

00:36:31.858 --> 00:36:33.734
Him? No, no.

00:36:34.151 --> 00:36:36.946
Quite happily, he's dead.
Very, very dead.

00:36:37.113 --> 00:36:39.156
- Ship went down.
- Inside the Triangle.

00:36:40.408 --> 00:36:41.534
He's coming for you, Jack,

00:36:41.617 --> 00:36:44.120
to seek revenge as
the dead man's tale is told.

00:36:44.287 --> 00:36:45.663
I don't believe you.

00:36:48.249 --> 00:36:49.333
What did he say?

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:51.752
He said your compass
was the key to his escape.

00:36:52.169 --> 00:36:54.839
An army of dead are coming
straight for you, Jack.

00:36:55.006 --> 00:36:57.592
The Trident of Poseidon
is your only hope.

00:36:59.427 --> 00:37:01.262
Do we have an accord?

00:37:09.353 --> 00:37:11.314
Well, I'm not going
in there to tell him.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.815
It was your idea.

00:37:12.982 --> 00:37:15.860
No, it was my idea
for you to tell him.

00:37:16.027 --> 00:37:17.528
He likes you more than me.

00:37:17.695 --> 00:37:19.280
He doesn't like anybody.

00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:43.554
Sorry, sir.

00:37:43.721 --> 00:37:45.306
We know you said
never to disturb you.

00:37:45.473 --> 00:37:47.224
Or to come in
without good cause.

00:37:47.308 --> 00:37:49.644
Or to speak
without first, um...

00:37:50.645 --> 00:37:52.063
Asking ourselves...

00:37:52.229 --> 00:37:55.024
Whether our thoughts
were absolutely necessary.

00:37:55.191 --> 00:37:56.984
Like the time the ship
was on fire.

00:37:57.151 --> 00:37:59.695
That being an example
of necessary thought.

00:37:59.862 --> 00:38:02.406
Sir, again, we do apologise
for starting that fire.

00:38:09.497 --> 00:38:10.831
Speak.

00:38:10.998 --> 00:38:12.917
It's your ships, sir.

00:38:13.084 --> 00:38:16.337
They're being attacked by
an enemy that takes no riches.

00:38:16.504 --> 00:38:18.297
Kills without provocation.

00:38:18.464 --> 00:38:19.548
My ships?

00:38:19.715 --> 00:38:21.175
Not possible.

00:38:21.342 --> 00:38:23.427
Three have already
been sunk, sir.

00:38:23.844 --> 00:38:26.514
They've been sunk by
a captain called Salamander.

00:38:26.639 --> 00:38:27.848
Samovar.

00:38:29.558 --> 00:38:30.685
Salazar.

00:38:30.851 --> 00:38:32.353
That's it,
your sirness.

00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.856
He leaves one man from
each vessel to tell the tale.

00:38:36.023 --> 00:38:39.068
The entire fleet
is being sunk...

00:38:39.235 --> 00:38:42.363
and we'll soon be dead.

00:38:42.530 --> 00:38:45.783
And quite possibly
out of business.

00:38:51.455 --> 00:38:54.166
I'll be needing some time
with your witch.

00:39:09.015 --> 00:39:10.850
I've been
expecting you, Captain.

00:39:11.851 --> 00:39:14.478
Perhaps you'd like some tea?

00:39:17.565 --> 00:39:19.775
I shall pass. Thank ye kindly.

00:39:21.277 --> 00:39:25.114
The price of crossing my door
is blood, Captain.

00:39:25.281 --> 00:39:28.325
That explains why
you're not so busy.

00:39:28.909 --> 00:39:31.454
Everyone pays eventually.

00:39:32.705 --> 00:39:35.082
Shansa, you and I
made a bond long ago.

00:39:35.583 --> 00:39:37.752
I saved you from the gallows,
remember?

00:39:37.918 --> 00:39:40.421
And I cursed your enemies.

00:39:40.588 --> 00:39:43.007
But now you
come to me in fear,

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:46.010
as the dead have taken
command of the sea.

00:39:46.177 --> 00:39:48.304
And what would the dead
be wanting with me?

00:39:49.388 --> 00:39:51.682
Not you, Captain.

00:39:51.849 --> 00:39:54.268
They're searching
for a Sparrow.

00:39:54.852 --> 00:39:56.103
Jack?

00:39:58.606 --> 00:40:01.484
Jack will sail
for the Trident...

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:05.029
with a girl and a <i>Pearl.</i>

00:40:05.696 --> 00:40:08.282
The Trident
can never be found.

00:40:11.786 --> 00:40:14.789
The Trident
is Jack's only hope.

00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:16.707
The dead are
conquering the sea,

00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:19.376
unable to step on dry land.

00:40:22.004 --> 00:40:25.883
Maybe you should retire
to the countryside.

00:40:27.301 --> 00:40:31.639
You mean grass? On a farm?

00:40:31.806 --> 00:40:37.686
Milkin' a cow, makin' cheese,
while they sink my treasure?

00:40:37.853 --> 00:40:40.731
Ask yourself this, Captain.

00:40:40.898 --> 00:40:43.776
Is this a treasure
worth dying for?

00:40:43.943 --> 00:40:45.569
I'm a pirate.

00:40:45.736 --> 00:40:47.196
Always will be.

00:40:47.363 --> 00:40:49.907
So how do I save what be mine?

00:40:50.074 --> 00:40:51.492
Jack held a compass

00:40:51.575 --> 00:40:54.537
which points you
to the thing you desire most.

00:40:54.703 --> 00:40:56.872
But betray the compass,

00:40:56.956 --> 00:40:59.291
and it releases
your greatest fear.

00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:02.962
A pirate's greatest fear
be Salazar, is it?

00:41:06.632 --> 00:41:07.842
How did you get this?

00:41:08.008 --> 00:41:09.718
I have my ways.

00:41:09.885 --> 00:41:12.763
Lead them to Jack
before he finds the Trident...

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:16.517
and all your treasure
will come back to you.

00:41:18.144 --> 00:41:20.938
Time to make a deal
with the dead.

00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:26.443
Come on, pirate!

00:41:32.908 --> 00:41:34.118
Hold on. Stop!

00:41:34.285 --> 00:41:36.120
Dad?

00:41:39.456 --> 00:41:40.624
Uncle Jack!

00:41:40.791 --> 00:41:43.252
Jackie boy! How's it going?

00:41:43.419 --> 00:41:45.004
Can't complain really. You?

00:41:45.212 --> 00:41:47.506
I've been waitin' all morning
in here for a beating.

00:41:47.673 --> 00:41:48.966
But the service is terrible.

00:41:49.425 --> 00:41:50.425
Shameful.

00:41:51.552 --> 00:41:52.636
Jack.

00:41:53.971 --> 00:41:55.848
The oceans have
turned to blood.

00:41:56.015 --> 00:41:59.185
Best to stay on dry land
where it's safe.

00:41:59.768 --> 00:42:02.188
I'm about to be executed
on dry land.

00:42:02.813 --> 00:42:03.856
Good point.

00:42:04.023 --> 00:42:05.863
Did I ever tell you
the one about the skeleton?

00:42:06.442 --> 00:42:07.985
Yes, you have.
Many times, in fact.

00:42:08.068 --> 00:42:09.153
Skeleton goes into a bar...

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:11.572
orders a beer and a mop.

00:42:13.949 --> 00:42:14.949
Funny as ever.

00:42:15.451 --> 00:42:17.369
Come on, let's go.

00:42:18.287 --> 00:42:21.290
Oh, if they disembowel you,
ask for Victor.

00:42:21.457 --> 00:42:23.042
He's got the softest hands.

00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.419
- Thank you!
- And mention my name.

00:42:25.586 --> 00:42:27.463
They won't cut your feet off.

00:42:47.399 --> 00:42:50.110
Come on. You're up first.

00:42:53.113 --> 00:42:54.990
And how would you
like to die, pirate?

00:42:55.407 --> 00:42:57.868
Hanging, firing squad,

00:42:57.952 --> 00:43:00.454
or a new invention:
the guillotine.

00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:03.123
Guillotine? Sounds French.

00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:04.291
I love the French.

00:43:04.375 --> 00:43:06.210
Did you know that
they invented mayonnaise?

00:43:06.377 --> 00:43:08.921
How bad could it be?
It's French, eh?

00:43:12.091 --> 00:43:13.133
Oh, well, then.

00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:14.969
I've changed me mind!

00:43:20.808 --> 00:43:22.393
No, please!
Have mercy upon me!

00:43:22.476 --> 00:43:23.936
I'm a bed-wetter.

00:43:41.787 --> 00:43:42.806
Oh, come on.

00:43:42.830 --> 00:43:44.999
I mean, I have to walk
upstairs as well for this?

00:43:45.165 --> 00:43:46.165
Bring the basket.

00:43:47.293 --> 00:43:48.711
Basket? Why?

00:43:50.212 --> 00:43:51.212
Strap him down!

00:43:59.430 --> 00:44:01.974
Here's an idea.
Here's an idea.

00:44:02.433 --> 00:44:04.393
Why don't we try a good
old-fashioned stoning, eh?

00:44:04.435 --> 00:44:06.270
I'd kill to be stoned
right now.

00:44:06.353 --> 00:44:08.188
Gets the crowd involved,
doesn't it?

00:44:08.355 --> 00:44:10.607
I should like to speak
to Victor in Disembowelment.

00:44:10.774 --> 00:44:12.359
I should like to speak to...

00:44:13.068 --> 00:44:15.237
I'm not one
to complain normally,

00:44:15.362 --> 00:44:17.740
but this basket's
full of heads.

00:44:26.832 --> 00:44:28.417
The final words
of Carina Smyth.

00:44:29.251 --> 00:44:30.878
Quiet!

00:44:35.215 --> 00:44:36.675
The final words
of Carina Smyth.

00:44:37.885 --> 00:44:39.970
Good sirs, I'm not a witch...

00:44:40.137 --> 00:44:41.764
but I forgive
your common dimwittedness

00:44:41.889 --> 00:44:43.557
and feeble brains.

00:44:43.724 --> 00:44:45.726
In short, most of you
have the mind of a goat.

00:44:45.893 --> 00:44:47.102
Pardon me, sir.

00:44:47.269 --> 00:44:49.589
Is it not common practice for
those about to be executed...

00:44:49.646 --> 00:44:52.107
to be granted a last,
I don't know, something...

00:44:52.274 --> 00:44:53.543
I believe
I was making a point.

00:44:53.567 --> 00:44:55.277
If you could just be patient.

00:44:55.444 --> 00:44:56.653
No!

00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.531
My head's about to be
lopped off, hence the urgency.

00:44:59.698 --> 00:45:01.075
And my neck is to be broken.

00:45:01.241 --> 00:45:02.961
Did you know
that on occasion,

00:45:03.035 --> 00:45:04.275
the neck doesn't
actually break?

00:45:04.370 --> 00:45:05.204
It just hurts.

00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:07.039
- What?
- Oh, yes.

00:45:07.289 --> 00:45:08.707
I've seen men swing for hours,

00:45:08.832 --> 00:45:10.209
eyes bulging,
tongues swelling...

00:45:10.542 --> 00:45:12.586
- revolting gurgling sound.
- May I finish?

00:45:12.753 --> 00:45:13.953
No! You're lucky.

00:45:14.171 --> 00:45:15.255
Wish I was hung.

00:45:16.507 --> 00:45:18.842
- Kill the filthy pirate. I'll wait.
- But witches first.

00:45:18.967 --> 00:45:21.011
I'm not a witch.
Were you not listening?

00:45:21.095 --> 00:45:22.155
Quite hard to listen

00:45:22.179 --> 00:45:23.448
when you have
the mind of a goat.

00:45:23.472 --> 00:45:24.765
Enough! Kill them both!

00:45:46.787 --> 00:45:48.205
Get another noose!

00:45:48.372 --> 00:45:50.624
Did you think
you could defeat us, boy?

00:45:50.791 --> 00:45:51.583
No, sir.

00:45:51.792 --> 00:45:53.293
I'm just the diversion.

00:45:54.128 --> 00:45:55.462
Fire!

00:46:21.572 --> 00:46:23.412
Still rather
be stoned!

00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:29.705
Reload!

00:46:46.805 --> 00:46:47.806
Ugh!

00:46:49.766 --> 00:46:51.059
Thank you.

00:46:54.855 --> 00:46:55.855
Die!

00:47:00.819 --> 00:47:03.530
- Come here, you pirate scum!
- Hey, hey!

00:47:08.952 --> 00:47:10.412
Oh, no.

00:47:13.123 --> 00:47:15.000
What are you doing?
No, no, no!

00:47:15.459 --> 00:47:16.459
Careful!

00:47:25.677 --> 00:47:26.677
Horses?

00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:29.473
Oh!

00:47:45.531 --> 00:47:46.531
Thank you!

00:47:46.907 --> 00:47:47.907
You're welcome, me lady.

00:47:49.284 --> 00:47:50.284
Got you!

00:47:56.542 --> 00:47:58.377
Knew you'd come
crawling back, traitor.

00:47:58.544 --> 00:48:00.796
The Turner boy gave us
10 silver pieces

00:48:00.879 --> 00:48:02.422
to save your neck.

00:48:09.263 --> 00:48:10.931
From this moment on,
we are to be allies.

00:48:11.098 --> 00:48:12.367
Considering
where your left hand is,

00:48:12.391 --> 00:48:13.551
I'd say we're more than that.

00:48:13.642 --> 00:48:15.411
We find the Trident together.
Do I have your word?

00:48:15.435 --> 00:48:17.145
You're holding everything
but my word.

00:48:17.604 --> 00:48:19.898
Then I bestow upon you
the honour of saving me

00:48:19.982 --> 00:48:21.191
for a small donation.

00:48:21.358 --> 00:48:23.902
You expect us to pay you
to save you?

00:48:25.279 --> 00:48:26.280
Yes.

00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:29.199
For a mere 10 pieces.

00:48:35.706 --> 00:48:37.040
Madness!

00:48:37.207 --> 00:48:38.834
We won't pay more than five!

00:48:39.001 --> 00:48:41.295
Well, then... Eight it is.

00:48:41.461 --> 00:48:42.814
Perhaps
we could discuss this later

00:48:42.838 --> 00:48:44.438
as I'm having trouble
hoisting your port!

00:48:44.464 --> 00:48:46.592
You are far from port.
That is my stern.

00:48:46.675 --> 00:48:47.843
Are you sure?

00:48:48.010 --> 00:48:48.760
Positive.

00:48:48.927 --> 00:48:50.721
Well, look at this.

00:48:51.138 --> 00:48:53.890
If I kill the coward,
the witch hangs.

00:48:54.266 --> 00:48:55.642
Two for the price of one.

00:48:55.809 --> 00:48:57.185
Please don't let go of me.

00:48:57.352 --> 00:48:59.104
Might be difficult
once he kills me.

00:49:04.401 --> 00:49:08.822
Gentlemen, these two prisoners
will lead us to the Trident.

00:49:11.575 --> 00:49:13.076
Captain.

00:49:13.243 --> 00:49:15.203
Do you really think
we can find the Trident?

00:49:15.370 --> 00:49:16.663
Master Gibbs,
you old worrywart,

00:49:16.830 --> 00:49:19.291
there's nothing to be
concerned about at all.

00:49:22.127 --> 00:49:23.962
What could possibly
go wrong, eh?

00:49:25.047 --> 00:49:26.048
So this was your plan?

00:49:26.131 --> 00:49:28.050
To be tortured
and killed by pirates.

00:49:28.216 --> 00:49:29.296
You said you needed a ship.

00:49:29.343 --> 00:49:30.093
You call this a ship?

00:49:30.218 --> 00:49:31.218
Cut the shard!

00:49:40.228 --> 00:49:41.563
Prepare to drown!

00:49:58.497 --> 00:50:01.249
Me dear beloved crew,
finally, today is...

00:50:12.886 --> 00:50:14.054
Something's gone wrong.

00:50:33.532 --> 00:50:34.532
She floats!

00:50:38.995 --> 00:50:40.831
Ship dead ahead!

00:50:48.422 --> 00:50:49.422
Sir.

00:50:50.966 --> 00:50:55.053
We would never question
your reason as a captain but...

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.140
But is there a reason...

00:50:58.306 --> 00:51:00.016
as captain,
you've chosen to sail

00:51:00.142 --> 00:51:01.810
in this unreasonable direction?

00:51:02.352 --> 00:51:04.479
Tell the men to prepare
to be boarded...

00:51:04.646 --> 00:51:07.774
to stand their ground
and show no fear.

00:51:13.363 --> 00:51:16.867
<i>Capitán,</i>
a ship sails toward us.

00:51:42.601 --> 00:51:44.001
<i>Capitán</i> Salazar...

00:51:44.144 --> 00:51:46.438
I hear you be looking
for Jack Sparrow.

00:52:10.086 --> 00:52:11.755
Hold point!

00:52:14.591 --> 00:52:16.676
And await orders.

00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:39.282
My name is Captain Barbossa,

00:52:39.366 --> 00:52:42.160
and I stand before you
with cordial intent.

00:52:42.744 --> 00:52:43.954
Cordial intent.

00:52:44.412 --> 00:52:45.664
Do you hear that?

00:52:45.747 --> 00:52:48.166
This pirate wishes
to be cordial.

00:52:48.333 --> 00:52:51.962
So let me show you
what my cordiality is, <i>hombre.</i>

00:52:52.379 --> 00:52:56.299
Every time I tap my sword,
one of your men will die.

00:52:56.466 --> 00:52:58.051
So I suggest that
you speak quickly.

00:53:02.556 --> 00:53:04.391
Might want to go
a bit faster, <i>Capitán.</i>

00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:10.021
Where's Jack Sparrow?

00:53:10.188 --> 00:53:12.691
Jack be sailing
for the Trident.

00:53:12.858 --> 00:53:14.192
No, the sea belongs
to the dead.

00:53:14.359 --> 00:53:16.069
The Trident controls the sea.

00:53:16.236 --> 00:53:17.696
No! No!

00:53:17.863 --> 00:53:19.990
There's no treasure.

00:53:20.156 --> 00:53:22.534
There's no treasure
that can save him.

00:53:22.617 --> 00:53:23.910
He will die, as will you.

00:53:24.077 --> 00:53:26.162
I be the only one
that can lead you to him.

00:53:27.831 --> 00:53:29.666
I declare you shall
have Jack's life

00:53:29.749 --> 00:53:31.042
by sunrise on the morrow...

00:53:31.209 --> 00:53:32.836
or you can take me own then.

00:53:33.003 --> 00:53:34.504
Do we have an accord?

00:53:41.636 --> 00:53:42.929
Take me to him,

00:53:43.013 --> 00:53:45.015
and you will live
to tell the tale.

00:53:45.432 --> 00:53:47.392
You have my word.

00:53:47.559 --> 00:53:51.021
I thank ye
on behalf of me crew.

00:53:54.691 --> 00:53:57.444
Well, hey, you can take
what's left of them.

00:53:57.777 --> 00:54:00.071
The living come aboard!

00:54:01.448 --> 00:54:02.991
Right, gentlemen.

00:54:08.246 --> 00:54:10.373
Carina, we haven't
got much time.

00:54:10.457 --> 00:54:11.897
The dead are sailing
straight for us.

00:54:12.042 --> 00:54:12.876
Is that so?

00:54:13.043 --> 00:54:14.044
Yes, I've spoken to them.

00:54:14.210 --> 00:54:15.295
You've spoken to them?

00:54:15.462 --> 00:54:17.714
Have you spoken to krakens
and mermaids as well?

00:54:17.881 --> 00:54:19.442
Krakens don't speak.
Everyone knows that.

00:54:19.466 --> 00:54:22.260
Of course.
I never should have saved you.

00:54:22.427 --> 00:54:23.738
Last night,
there was a blood moon,

00:54:23.762 --> 00:54:25.180
just as you described.

00:54:25.347 --> 00:54:26.348
Tell me what it revealed.

00:54:26.514 --> 00:54:27.594
And why should I trust you?

00:54:28.266 --> 00:54:30.018
You trusted me
to hold your port, remember?

00:54:30.185 --> 00:54:32.896
It was my stern. Clearly, you need to
spend more time at sea.

00:54:33.063 --> 00:54:34.983
Tell me what you found
and I promise to help you.

00:54:35.106 --> 00:54:35.941
I don't need any help.

00:54:36.107 --> 00:54:38.234
Then why did you
come to me, Carina?

00:54:38.401 --> 00:54:40.129
Why are we tied together
in the middle of the sea,

00:54:40.153 --> 00:54:41.947
chasing the same treasure?

00:54:44.449 --> 00:54:46.368
The moon revealed a clue.

00:54:46.534 --> 00:54:50.330
"To release the power
of the sea, all must divide."

00:54:51.456 --> 00:54:53.541
Divide? What does it mean?

00:54:54.876 --> 00:54:56.544
I'm not sure yet.

00:54:58.088 --> 00:54:59.255
Then we'll find out.

00:55:01.341 --> 00:55:02.926
There is no map in this map.

00:55:03.218 --> 00:55:04.719
Give me my diary.

00:55:06.262 --> 00:55:07.973
Give me
<i>The Map No Man Can Read.</i>

00:55:08.139 --> 00:55:09.015
If you could read it,

00:55:09.099 --> 00:55:10.576
then it wouldn't be called
<i>"The Map No Man Can Read."</i>

00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.727
I beg you, please,
don't argue with her.

00:55:12.894 --> 00:55:15.397
Most of the men on this ship
can't read.

00:55:15.563 --> 00:55:19.526
Which makes all maps
<i>The Maps That No Man Can Read.</i>

00:55:19.693 --> 00:55:22.779
Well, if you can't read it,
then you have no use for it or me.

00:55:23.571 --> 00:55:24.906
Let me start again.

00:55:25.407 --> 00:55:27.325
Show me the map.

00:55:27.492 --> 00:55:30.036
I can't. It doesn't yet exist.

00:55:30.203 --> 00:55:31.203
She's a witch!

00:55:31.663 --> 00:55:32.747
I'm an astronomer.

00:55:33.039 --> 00:55:35.625
Ah! Ah, she breeds donkeys.

00:55:36.209 --> 00:55:39.796
What? No. An astronomer
contemplates the sky.

00:55:39.963 --> 00:55:42.716
- Yeah, on a donkey?
- No! There's no donkey!

00:55:42.882 --> 00:55:44.592
Well, then how
do you breed them?

00:55:45.135 --> 00:55:47.887
Allow me
to simplify this equation.

00:55:48.054 --> 00:55:49.723
Give me the map...

00:55:50.932 --> 00:55:52.934
or I will kill...

00:55:54.436 --> 00:55:55.979
him. I'll kill him.

00:55:58.732 --> 00:56:00.358
Go on then.

00:56:00.525 --> 00:56:01.651
You're bluffing.

00:56:02.902 --> 00:56:04.571
And you're blushing.

00:56:06.239 --> 00:56:07.532
Throw him over.

00:56:08.033 --> 00:56:09.033
Come. Come on.

00:56:09.325 --> 00:56:10.678
- Come on.
- Come on. Come on.

00:56:12.078 --> 00:56:13.872
We call this keelhauling.

00:56:14.998 --> 00:56:17.500
Young Henry will be
tossed over...

00:56:18.877 --> 00:56:21.171
and he will be dragged
under the ship.

00:56:21.337 --> 00:56:24.049
All right.
What're you waiting for?

00:56:24.215 --> 00:56:25.467
Uh, he doesn't appear to be...

00:56:25.633 --> 00:56:27.677
- Zip, zip.
- Nope, not bluffing, me.

00:56:28.136 --> 00:56:30.114
He's trying to say something.

00:56:30.138 --> 00:56:32.223
No, no, we don't have
any food aboard. Sorry.

00:56:33.391 --> 00:56:36.144
If he's lucky, he'll drown
before the barnacles

00:56:36.227 --> 00:56:37.395
shred him to ribbons.

00:56:37.562 --> 00:56:38.396
Barnacles?

00:56:38.563 --> 00:56:40.940
Like a thousand knives
across your back.

00:56:41.399 --> 00:56:43.068
'Course the blood
attracts sharks.

00:56:43.234 --> 00:56:44.234
Sharks?

00:56:44.527 --> 00:56:45.527
Shark off the bow!

00:56:46.404 --> 00:56:50.116
I would say that swimming is
no longer his primary concern.

00:56:50.283 --> 00:56:51.284
The map is there!

00:56:51.826 --> 00:56:52.660
Where?

00:56:52.827 --> 00:56:53.867
On the tip of your finger?

00:56:53.953 --> 00:56:56.331
No. In the heavens.

00:56:56.498 --> 00:56:59.375
That diary will lead me
to a map hidden in the stars.

00:56:59.542 --> 00:57:02.170
Let him up.
I'll find it tonight.

00:57:02.337 --> 00:57:05.256
Sorry, can't bring him up.
Look for yourself.

00:57:08.551 --> 00:57:11.346
As I said... blushing.

00:57:17.435 --> 00:57:19.187
Filthy pirate.

00:57:23.441 --> 00:57:25.235
The sea has turned to blood.

00:57:25.568 --> 00:57:28.655
A sailor washed ashore
talking about the Trident.

00:57:28.822 --> 00:57:30.448
He was looking
for Jack Sparrow.

00:57:30.615 --> 00:57:33.535
The same pirate who saved
a witch from the gallows.

00:57:33.701 --> 00:57:35.328
She's no witch.

00:57:35.703 --> 00:57:37.497
But you are.

00:57:38.039 --> 00:57:39.833
And you're going to help us.

00:57:39.999 --> 00:57:41.960
You're afraid, Lieutenant.

00:57:43.211 --> 00:57:44.504
As ships burn in the night,

00:57:44.587 --> 00:57:46.965
you want to know
if you can save your own.

00:57:47.715 --> 00:57:50.927
If the Trident is real.

00:57:51.094 --> 00:57:54.806
You're going to read that wall
for me or you will die.

00:57:54.973 --> 00:57:58.560
The British Empire will have
the Trident and rule the sea.

00:57:58.726 --> 00:58:00.770
I want to know where
that pirate is going

00:58:00.854 --> 00:58:02.230
with that witch.

00:58:02.939 --> 00:58:05.483
Your destiny is
in these stars.

00:58:05.650 --> 00:58:08.111
I will set your course.

00:58:33.344 --> 00:58:35.471
Spaghetti wolf!

00:58:35.638 --> 00:58:37.807
Why did I bother
coming to you?

00:58:37.974 --> 00:58:40.101
The dead are hunting us down
and you do nothing.

00:58:40.268 --> 00:58:41.978
Nothing!
You call this nothing?

00:58:42.145 --> 00:58:43.563
You're drunk!
And you're sleeping.

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:47.400
My point exactly!
I am doing two things at once.

00:58:47.817 --> 00:58:50.486
You can't save
the unsaveable, mate.

00:58:51.738 --> 00:58:53.538
Like it or not, Jack,
you're going to help me.

00:58:53.615 --> 00:58:55.241
I will break
my father's curse.

00:58:58.286 --> 00:59:03.750
Next time you raise a sword,
boy, be the last to die.

00:59:15.929 --> 00:59:17.222
Oh.

00:59:19.599 --> 00:59:23.394
Might I suggest you entice her
with a bit of flattery?

00:59:24.812 --> 00:59:26.689
I'm here for my father,
nothing more.

00:59:26.856 --> 00:59:30.944
I knew it.
Absolutely smitten with her.

00:59:31.110 --> 00:59:34.197
Now, a bit of discretion
when courting a brunette...

00:59:34.364 --> 00:59:36.199
never pursue her sister.

00:59:36.366 --> 00:59:40.203
But if you cannot avoid
the charm of her sister...

00:59:40.370 --> 00:59:41.496
kill the brother.

00:59:41.663 --> 00:59:42.789
Savvy?

00:59:44.374 --> 00:59:46.251
No, I do not savvy.

00:59:47.919 --> 00:59:49.545
Who hurt you?

00:59:49.712 --> 00:59:52.507
By the way, that little
sliver of knowledge

00:59:52.590 --> 00:59:54.425
will cost you five pieces.

00:59:54.592 --> 00:59:55.712
I'm not paying you for that.

00:59:56.177 --> 00:59:58.513
Never say that to a woman.

01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:14.904
Just because
you can't see something,

01:00:14.988 --> 01:00:16.281
doesn't mean it's not there.

01:00:17.490 --> 01:00:18.658
Like the map?

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:22.161
I have to find it.

01:00:23.871 --> 01:00:25.999
It's the only link
to who I am.

01:00:26.082 --> 01:00:27.500
Who my father was.

01:00:29.043 --> 01:00:32.255
So we've both spent our lives
searching for our fathers.

01:00:33.298 --> 01:00:35.383
Perhaps you and I
are closer than you think.

01:00:52.275 --> 01:00:54.694
The sun is up,
and so is your time.

01:00:57.447 --> 01:00:58.448
Not to disagree,

01:00:58.531 --> 01:01:01.284
but the precision
of our accord ends at sunrise.

01:01:01.451 --> 01:01:04.245
This be but first light,
far from a fully risin' sun.

01:01:04.412 --> 01:01:05.997
And I know you to be
a man of honour.

01:01:06.164 --> 01:01:08.082
Honour? You know nothing of me.

01:01:08.249 --> 01:01:10.501
I know what it's like to be
bested by Jack Sparrow.

01:01:10.668 --> 01:01:12.003
He's an enemy to us...

01:01:12.628 --> 01:01:14.005
You don't know who I am.

01:01:15.548 --> 01:01:18.551
I've heard stories
of a mighty Spanish captain,

01:01:18.634 --> 01:01:20.386
<i>El Matador Del Mar.</i>

01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:22.221
A man who scourged the sea,

01:01:22.305 --> 01:01:24.307
hunted and killed
thousands of men.

01:01:24.932 --> 01:01:27.393
No, no, no. Men, no.
No, no, no.

01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.103
Pirates, eh?

01:01:31.689 --> 01:01:33.775
Pirates.

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:41.616
<i>Pirates had infected the seas
for generations.</i>

01:01:41.783 --> 01:01:45.244
<i>Taking the life of my father
and his father before.</i>

01:01:45.411 --> 01:01:48.956
<i>So I vowed to end this plague
once and for all.</i>

01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:51.959
And that is what I did.
I destroyed dozens of ships.

01:01:58.174 --> 01:02:02.512
The last ones joined together
to try and defeat me!

01:02:02.678 --> 01:02:05.598
But they soon realised
it was hopeless.

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:20.029
<i>Nothing could stop
the</i> Silent Mary.

01:02:21.406 --> 01:02:22.424
Hit them below the water line.

01:02:22.448 --> 01:02:23.449
<i>Vamos! Vamos!</i>

01:02:26.828 --> 01:02:29.122
Hang on, boys!

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:42.051
The sea was finally pure.

01:02:42.343 --> 01:02:45.346
<i>Their wretched flags
would no longer stain the sea.</i>

01:02:54.272 --> 01:02:56.482
They are begging for mercy.

01:02:57.150 --> 01:03:00.528
Mercy? Mercy?

01:03:01.404 --> 01:03:02.905
There's no mercy.

01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:10.663
Make ready!

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.590
Please, help us!

01:03:16.586 --> 01:03:17.712
<i>Adiós!</i>

01:03:18.171 --> 01:03:19.171
Fire!

01:03:28.097 --> 01:03:30.641
It's up to you now, Jack.

01:03:32.310 --> 01:03:36.606
This compass points towards
what you want most.

01:03:38.691 --> 01:03:41.861
Never betray it.

01:04:12.475 --> 01:04:15.811
The Devil's Triangle.

01:04:16.395 --> 01:04:18.606
<i>The last of their ships</i>

01:04:18.689 --> 01:04:20.775
<i>were burning before my eyes.</i>

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:26.781
And in that moment
of victory...

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:28.908
it's when I heard it.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:32.787
Hey! Hold on, <i>Capitán.</i>

01:04:33.037 --> 01:04:34.080
<i>One ship</i>

01:04:34.163 --> 01:04:35.957
<i>was trying to escape
through the smoke.</i>

01:04:36.123 --> 01:04:38.960
It's
a lovely day for a sail, innit?

01:04:39.126 --> 01:04:41.671
And there,
in the crow's nest...

01:04:41.837 --> 01:04:45.716
there was this young pirate boy.

01:04:45.883 --> 01:04:46.759
The way I see it,

01:04:46.842 --> 01:04:48.122
there's just the two of us left.

01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:51.138
You surrender to me now
and I'll let you live. Simple.

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:55.017
He stood there looking like
a little bird, eh?

01:04:55.184 --> 01:04:56.269
And from that day...

01:04:56.435 --> 01:04:58.980
he earned himself a name
that would haunt me

01:04:59.063 --> 01:05:00.606
for the rest of my days...

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:04.277
Jack the Sparrow.

01:05:04.443 --> 01:05:08.030
Right then. You surrender
to me now and I let you live.

01:05:09.532 --> 01:05:11.534
I shall let you live.

01:05:18.124 --> 01:05:22.920
This boy was mocking my power,
so I chased him...

01:05:23.588 --> 01:05:26.549
knowing that I would
run my knife along his neck...

01:05:26.716 --> 01:05:27.967
and when he was dead,

01:05:28.134 --> 01:05:31.345
I would finish finally
with the pirate's life.

01:05:36.225 --> 01:05:37.268
Follow him in.

01:05:38.853 --> 01:05:41.856
To the gallows.
Grab some lines.

01:05:43.858 --> 01:05:46.068
Prepare the bootleg. Portside.

01:05:48.654 --> 01:05:49.905
Throw it now.

01:06:11.761 --> 01:06:13.220
Bootleg turn.

01:07:23.082 --> 01:07:24.959
What's all this?

01:07:27.795 --> 01:07:30.423
Tribute, sir.

01:07:42.393 --> 01:07:43.393
Ooh!

01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:02.413
<i>He took everything from me...</i>

01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:05.833
<i>and filled me with rage.</i>

01:08:08.461 --> 01:08:10.129
And pain.

01:08:11.672 --> 01:08:15.468
And here is
where the tale ends.

01:08:16.677 --> 01:08:19.346
Not yet, <i>Capitán</i>. There!

01:08:19.555 --> 01:08:21.557
Found as promised.

01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:47.416
So she's saying
she's got the map,

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.100
but she's the only one
who can follow it?

01:08:49.168 --> 01:08:50.544
So we should shoot her?

01:08:50.711 --> 01:08:52.838
Leave her be. She will
take us to the Trident.

01:08:53.005 --> 01:08:54.325
You've been saying
that for hours.

01:08:54.381 --> 01:08:56.008
Two things we know
are true, eh?

01:08:56.175 --> 01:08:57.635
- Yeah.
- Stars don't shine by day.

01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:59.470
And she forgot the donkey.

01:09:00.304 --> 01:09:04.475
How can we go to a spot where
no land exists on any map?

01:09:05.643 --> 01:09:08.354
This chronometer keeps
the exact time in London.

01:09:08.813 --> 01:09:10.689
I'm using it to make
an altitude measurement

01:09:10.773 --> 01:09:12.316
to determine longitude.

01:09:12.483 --> 01:09:15.027
Only then will we find
our exact spot at sea.

01:09:15.194 --> 01:09:17.738
So you expect to find
the Trident with a timepiece?

01:09:17.905 --> 01:09:19.114
Yes.

01:09:19.532 --> 01:09:21.826
My calculations
are precise and true.

01:09:21.992 --> 01:09:24.620
I'm not only an astronomer,
I'm also a horologist.

01:09:24.745 --> 01:09:26.163
Mmm.

01:09:30.459 --> 01:09:31.669
No shame in that, dear.

01:09:31.836 --> 01:09:34.755
I mean, we all have
to earn a living, eh?

01:09:34.922 --> 01:09:36.173
Oh, yeah.

01:09:36.882 --> 01:09:39.510
No. No, I'm a horologist.

01:09:39.677 --> 01:09:41.011
So was my mum.

01:09:41.178 --> 01:09:42.898
But she didn't crow about it
as loud as you.

01:09:42.972 --> 01:09:45.182
Are you saying your mother
was academically inclined?

01:09:45.641 --> 01:09:49.520
More like,
horizontally reclined.

01:09:50.729 --> 01:09:52.940
Horology is the study of time.

01:09:53.107 --> 01:09:55.359
And she was always
looking at her watch.

01:09:55.526 --> 01:09:56.902
I can vouch for that.

01:09:58.571 --> 01:10:02.408
So no one can find the "X"
but you, right?

01:10:02.575 --> 01:10:03.844
- No.
- And the donkey?

01:10:03.868 --> 01:10:05.703
Ship to the aft!

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:08.830
Salazar.

01:10:13.335 --> 01:10:15.616
Jack, the dead will not rest
until they get their revenge.

01:10:15.713 --> 01:10:16.964
Dead?

01:10:17.131 --> 01:10:19.049
No, no. The dead were never
part of this deal.

01:10:19.216 --> 01:10:20.634
We should have never followed

01:10:20.718 --> 01:10:22.177
a luckless pirate
and a witch to sea.

01:10:22.803 --> 01:10:24.597
Right, that's it.
Kill 'em all.

01:10:25.806 --> 01:10:28.893
Kill me and I'll be dead.

01:10:29.059 --> 01:10:30.436
And then the other dead

01:10:30.561 --> 01:10:32.938
won't be able to
have their revenge...

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:34.732
against me.

01:10:35.482 --> 01:10:36.525
Being dead.

01:10:36.692 --> 01:10:37.526
What?

01:10:37.693 --> 01:10:39.254
Which will anger them
even more. He's right.

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:40.278
That's right.

01:10:40.362 --> 01:10:41.614
Are all pirates this stupid?

01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.531
Yes.

01:10:42.698 --> 01:10:43.698
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:45.618
What are we going to do?

01:10:46.285 --> 01:10:50.581
As Captain, might I suggest...

01:10:55.044 --> 01:10:57.129
Mutiny?
You had to suggest a mutiny?

01:10:57.296 --> 01:10:58.656
Carina,
the dead are coming.

01:10:58.756 --> 01:11:01.967
Well, I choose not to believe
in supernatural nonsense.

01:11:02.134 --> 01:11:03.719
Do you not see
what's behind us?

01:11:17.775 --> 01:11:20.653
Drop them. Drop them.

01:11:28.035 --> 01:11:29.054
What are you doing?

01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:30.764
The men on that ship
are looking for Jack

01:11:30.788 --> 01:11:31.788
and Jack is on this boat.

01:11:31.830 --> 01:11:32.950
So I'm going to swim for it.

01:11:33.248 --> 01:11:36.251
How dare you do exactly
what I would do if I were you.

01:11:36.418 --> 01:11:38.879
- Carina, stop that.
- No, no, no. Don't stop that.

01:11:39.046 --> 01:11:40.172
This has gone far enough.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.799
No, it has not.

01:11:41.966 --> 01:11:45.177
Listen not to him.
Carry on. Carry on.

01:11:50.891 --> 01:11:53.185
Why? She was almost finished.

01:11:53.352 --> 01:11:54.520
I saw her ankles.

01:11:54.603 --> 01:11:55.643
You'd have seen a lot more

01:11:55.688 --> 01:11:57.208
if you'd have kept
your cake hole shut.

01:12:15.165 --> 01:12:17.376
Kill the Sparrow.

01:12:33.475 --> 01:12:35.978
Oh, that's not good, is it?

01:12:36.145 --> 01:12:39.148
Keep rowing, man.
Faster. Faster.

01:12:39.314 --> 01:12:41.400
No. That's it.

01:12:42.317 --> 01:12:44.194
I'm going with her.

01:12:44.361 --> 01:12:47.114
You would leave me for
some horologist in her knickers?

01:12:47.281 --> 01:12:48.281
Yes.

01:12:50.034 --> 01:12:51.660
You men are all alike.

01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:03.172
Shark.

01:13:27.988 --> 01:13:28.988
Henry!

01:13:51.637 --> 01:13:52.888
Doesn't seem to be working!

01:13:53.055 --> 01:13:54.932
No, we'll be fine.
We'll be fine.

01:14:01.313 --> 01:14:03.065
<i>Vamos!</i>

01:14:14.701 --> 01:14:15.994
How do they do that?

01:14:16.161 --> 01:14:18.247
We have to swim for it.
I'll distract them.

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:25.838
Now!

01:14:44.690 --> 01:14:46.191
Oh, shoo!

01:14:49.945 --> 01:14:50.988
Go away!

01:15:06.420 --> 01:15:07.796
Henry!

01:15:57.763 --> 01:15:58.847
Oh!

01:15:58.931 --> 01:16:02.017
Hi, Jack Sparrow.

01:16:03.477 --> 01:16:04.937
Jack the Sparrow.

01:16:05.437 --> 01:16:07.272
You're Spanish?

01:16:12.778 --> 01:16:14.738
You're ghosts!

01:16:14.947 --> 01:16:16.114
Oh.

01:16:16.198 --> 01:16:18.200
They're unable
to step on land.

01:16:18.408 --> 01:16:20.035
I knew that, though.

01:16:20.202 --> 01:16:21.286
Ghosts!

01:16:24.957 --> 01:16:25.957
Carina!

01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:28.377
You will soon pay
for what you did to me.

01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:30.671
No, no, no. There's
no need to bother, really.

01:16:30.837 --> 01:16:32.277
- Carina!
- I have no time to chat...

01:16:32.381 --> 01:16:33.882
because me map's
just run away.

01:16:34.049 --> 01:16:35.968
I will be waiting for you!

01:16:36.718 --> 01:16:38.387
Why would you be
waiting for me?

01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:39.805
Why would he be
waiting for me?

01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:57.739
Pirates!

01:17:12.713 --> 01:17:13.880
Scrum.

01:17:14.089 --> 01:17:15.257
Captain.

01:17:15.424 --> 01:17:16.425
Jack always told me that

01:17:16.508 --> 01:17:17.652
if anything should
ever happen to him...

01:17:17.676 --> 01:17:19.094
he wanted you to be captain.

01:17:19.761 --> 01:17:21.430
Yeah, but the men
voted for you.

01:17:21.513 --> 01:17:22.889
That's why you got
a captain's hat.

01:17:23.056 --> 01:17:24.182
Be that as it may...

01:17:24.349 --> 01:17:25.434
them were his wishes,

01:17:25.517 --> 01:17:27.227
so be a good lad
and take the wheel.

01:17:27.394 --> 01:17:28.854
And, uh, you...

01:17:30.022 --> 01:17:31.440
take the captain's hat.

01:17:31.940 --> 01:17:33.108
Oh.

01:17:33.191 --> 01:17:34.591
This is the proudest
moment of my...

01:17:38.196 --> 01:17:40.032
We will beat your captain
to death...

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:42.034
until he reveals
where they're heading.

01:17:44.536 --> 01:17:45.537
Carina!

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:47.706
I know
what's ailing you, boy.

01:17:47.873 --> 01:17:50.500
You've got
the unscratchable itch.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:51.769
Carina is the only one

01:17:51.793 --> 01:17:53.104
who can help us
find the Trident...

01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:54.546
and I'm not in love with her.

01:17:54.713 --> 01:17:55.756
Love?

01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:57.608
Who said anything about love?
What are you talking about?

01:17:57.632 --> 01:17:59.051
The unscratchable itch?

01:17:59.217 --> 01:18:00.969
Scabies.
I'm talking about scabies.

01:18:01.136 --> 01:18:03.305
Small mites that burrow
under the skin.

01:18:03.472 --> 01:18:05.307
It's certainly ailing me,
has been for years.

01:18:05.474 --> 01:18:07.017
Oh, no.

01:18:09.436 --> 01:18:10.436
Help!

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:12.898
Help me!

01:18:13.065 --> 01:18:14.232
- Carina!
- Help!

01:18:15.275 --> 01:18:17.444
- Henry, help me!
- Help her!

01:18:19.279 --> 01:18:20.631
<i>By rule of the King,</i>

01:18:20.655 --> 01:18:22.449
I sentence you all to death!

01:18:23.909 --> 01:18:26.244
I think we should
tell each other

01:18:26.328 --> 01:18:27.913
where our treasures
are buried...

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.082
just in case
one of us survives.

01:18:30.248 --> 01:18:32.000
Oh, good idea.

01:18:32.167 --> 01:18:33.752
You go first.

01:18:33.919 --> 01:18:36.505
My treasure is buried between
two crossed palm trees...

01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:40.133
in an unmarked grave in Aruba.
What about yours?

01:18:41.093 --> 01:18:42.469
I haven't got any.

01:18:42.636 --> 01:18:44.471
You promised me Jack's blood!

01:18:44.638 --> 01:18:46.306
But Jack be trapped!

01:18:46.473 --> 01:18:48.266
He can never escape
that island.

01:18:48.433 --> 01:18:49.684
He's on land!

01:18:55.607 --> 01:18:56.607
Hello.

01:19:01.446 --> 01:19:04.950
I upheld our deal. Me men
and meself will go ashore.

01:19:05.117 --> 01:19:06.701
The scurvy traitor
will be yours...

01:19:07.119 --> 01:19:08.453
on me honour.

01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:11.957
Honour? What honour<i>, hombre?</i>
What honour?

01:19:12.124 --> 01:19:13.324
You don't know what honour is.

01:19:13.458 --> 01:19:15.419
Spare me my life,

01:19:15.502 --> 01:19:17.170
and I'll fetch you
the Sparrow.

01:19:19.673 --> 01:19:21.299
An accord?

01:19:36.106 --> 01:19:38.650
Wake up, Sparrow.

01:19:42.195 --> 01:19:45.115
Wake up, Sparrow.

01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:50.829
Wake up, Sparrow.
It's time to pay your debt.

01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:55.041
Pig... Pig Kelly?

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:57.502
Me old mate.

01:19:57.669 --> 01:20:01.173
Mate?
You hear that, boys?

01:20:01.339 --> 01:20:04.593
This lyin' pirate owes me
a plunder of silver...

01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:07.387
and luck has brought him
to Hangman's Bay...

01:20:07.554 --> 01:20:10.682
where he can settle his debt
here and now.

01:20:10.849 --> 01:20:13.435
Oh, and I will. I will, Pig.

01:20:13.602 --> 01:20:14.686
Name your price.

01:20:14.853 --> 01:20:17.939
Her name is Beatrice...

01:20:20.358 --> 01:20:22.777
and she's my poor,
widowed sister.

01:20:25.864 --> 01:20:27.240
What is that?

01:20:27.407 --> 01:20:29.743
She's been looking
for a respectable man.

01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:31.411
But you'll have to do.

01:20:31.578 --> 01:20:32.778
Louis, let's get on with this.

01:20:32.871 --> 01:20:34.706
No! Why? Why would we do that?

01:20:34.873 --> 01:20:36.753
To make
an honest woman of her, Jack.

01:20:37.125 --> 01:20:39.920
Congratulations.
It's your wedding day.

01:20:41.004 --> 01:20:42.547
Let us begin.

01:20:42.714 --> 01:20:44.883
We'll honeymoon in the barn.

01:20:49.429 --> 01:20:50.430
No, no, no.

01:20:51.056 --> 01:20:52.641
Now, Pig, how could I...

01:20:52.807 --> 01:20:54.893
honestly make
an honest woman out of it?

01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:57.270
That... Her. I mean, her.

01:20:59.898 --> 01:21:02.108
What are those things?

01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:03.777
Our children.

01:21:03.944 --> 01:21:06.321
Best not look them in the eye.

01:21:06.488 --> 01:21:08.448
Bring the best man
and the bridesmaid.

01:21:09.991 --> 01:21:11.243
I looked it in the eye.

01:21:11.409 --> 01:21:13.495
Place your hand on the Bible.

01:21:14.162 --> 01:21:15.413
I've got scabies.

01:21:15.580 --> 01:21:17.082
- So do I.
- Ugh!

01:21:17.457 --> 01:21:19.960
Place your hand on the Bible.

01:21:20.794 --> 01:21:21.836
I'm a bed-wetter.

01:21:22.003 --> 01:21:23.505
Say "I do..."

01:21:24.381 --> 01:21:26.091
or I'll put a bullet
in your skull.

01:21:26.258 --> 01:21:27.467
Jack, they're going
to kill us!

01:21:27.634 --> 01:21:29.386
- I don't care!
- Just say "I do."

01:21:29.553 --> 01:21:30.971
- Last chance, Jack.
- Wait!

01:21:31.137 --> 01:21:33.765
Surely, this is not legal.

01:21:33.932 --> 01:21:35.267
This is not legal.

01:21:35.433 --> 01:21:36.518
He's right.

01:21:36.685 --> 01:21:39.271
Does any man here
object to these nuptials?

01:21:39.771 --> 01:21:41.856
- I do.
- Congratulations!

01:21:42.023 --> 01:21:44.192
You may kiss the bride!

01:21:52.826 --> 01:21:53.827
No.

01:21:56.288 --> 01:21:57.998
You like seafood, do you?

01:21:58.164 --> 01:21:59.291
Come on!

01:22:02.836 --> 01:22:05.463
Jack, we meet again.

01:22:06.214 --> 01:22:07.465
Hector!

01:22:07.632 --> 01:22:10.051
This is me bestest mate
in the whole world.

01:22:10.218 --> 01:22:12.804
I always knew
you'd settle down eventually.

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:14.180
Did you bring me a gift?

01:22:16.474 --> 01:22:17.642
That'll do.

01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:22.063
You look marvellous.

01:22:22.147 --> 01:22:23.815
Got quite the spring
in your step.

01:22:24.899 --> 01:22:26.484
Has your leg grown back?

01:22:26.651 --> 01:22:28.987
Uh, Captain, shouldn't we
be getting back to Salazar...

01:22:29.154 --> 01:22:31.656
trade Mr Sparrow's life
in for our own?

01:22:31.823 --> 01:22:33.301
Aye, that we could...

01:22:33.325 --> 01:22:35.827
but I've come
for the Trident of Poseidon.

01:22:36.536 --> 01:22:38.204
You're gonna double-cross
the dead?

01:22:38.371 --> 01:22:39.664
You did promise.

01:22:39.831 --> 01:22:42.000
And with it,
I'll gut the dead that stole

01:22:42.083 --> 01:22:43.585
my command of the sea.

01:22:43.752 --> 01:22:45.712
As much as I love this plan...

01:22:45.879 --> 01:22:49.674
no vessel can outrun
that wretched hull of a ship.

01:22:49.841 --> 01:22:51.259
But there be one, Jack.

01:22:51.426 --> 01:22:54.179
The fastest ship I know,
the <i>Pearl...</i>

01:22:54.346 --> 01:22:58.350
trapped in that bottle by
Blackbeard five winters ago.

01:23:00.352 --> 01:23:02.103
By the power of that

01:23:02.228 --> 01:23:03.428
blackguard's
sovereign blade...

01:23:03.480 --> 01:23:06.024
I hereby release
the <i>Black Pearl</i>

01:23:06.191 --> 01:23:08.485
to her former
and rightful glory.

01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:20.872
Get ready!

01:23:21.873 --> 01:23:23.375
Get ready for it!

01:23:23.875 --> 01:23:24.542
It's coming!

01:23:24.709 --> 01:23:26.419
It's coming!
It's coming, it's coming!

01:23:32.008 --> 01:23:34.344
Stand aside! Stand aside!

01:23:35.428 --> 01:23:36.930
It's coming!

01:23:52.779 --> 01:23:54.280
It's shrunken.

01:23:54.906 --> 01:23:56.908
Why doesn't it unshrink?

01:23:57.450 --> 01:23:59.077
Maybe it's cold, huh?

01:23:59.244 --> 01:24:01.037
She needs the sea.

01:24:14.676 --> 01:24:17.303
She was a fine ship.

01:24:52.297 --> 01:24:54.090
Let...

01:24:55.383 --> 01:24:58.386
There be room
for only one captain.

01:24:59.429 --> 01:25:00.430
Ooh!

01:25:00.805 --> 01:25:01.973
Filthy beast.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.476
Time to race the dead.

01:25:10.982 --> 01:25:13.151
The only
safe place is the land.

01:25:13.318 --> 01:25:16.905
Why are we going away
from the land? Anyone?

01:25:17.071 --> 01:25:19.741
Captain,
your map is incomplete.

01:25:19.908 --> 01:25:22.619
I can take us to the Trident
if you'd only trust me.

01:25:22.786 --> 01:25:23.453
Anyone?

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:26.122
Did you not hear anything
I just said?

01:25:26.289 --> 01:25:28.374
So you be saying that
that star

01:25:28.458 --> 01:25:29.793
is pretendin' to be a map?

01:25:29.959 --> 01:25:32.462
Sir, there is
no island on any map

01:25:32.587 --> 01:25:34.255
to support
what the woman says.

01:25:34.422 --> 01:25:36.062
Captain, you don't have to
understand her.

01:25:36.466 --> 01:25:37.842
Just believe her.

01:25:39.010 --> 01:25:40.428
Anyone?

01:25:52.482 --> 01:25:55.652
If we had something sharp,
I could pick that lock.

01:25:57.237 --> 01:25:59.447
You're not gonna find
anything sharp in here.

01:26:05.787 --> 01:26:08.832
Keep still, you bilge rat.

01:26:08.998 --> 01:26:09.998
Captain!

01:26:10.124 --> 01:26:12.544
No, please! I don't wanna
be captain any more!

01:26:21.469 --> 01:26:22.469
Release 'em!

01:26:25.014 --> 01:26:27.559
Sir, you wouldn't allow...

01:26:27.725 --> 01:26:29.561
a woman to steer your ship?

01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:32.564
She will follow her star,
or we'll all die together.

01:26:52.083 --> 01:26:55.295
The <i>Black Pearl!</i>
She sails again!

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.200
Come on, lads!

01:26:58.298 --> 01:27:01.342
This ship, those ghosts...

01:27:01.801 --> 01:27:03.636
There can be
no logical explanation.

01:27:03.803 --> 01:27:05.972
The myths of the sea
are real, Carina.

01:27:06.139 --> 01:27:07.974
I'm glad you can finally see
you were wrong.

01:27:08.308 --> 01:27:09.309
Wrong?

01:27:11.352 --> 01:27:12.770
Perhaps I had some doubts.

01:27:12.937 --> 01:27:14.772
This is the worst apology
I've ever heard.

01:27:14.939 --> 01:27:16.733
Apology?
Why would I apologise?

01:27:17.108 --> 01:27:18.252
Because we've been
chased by the dead,

01:27:18.276 --> 01:27:19.712
sailing on a ship raised
from a bottle.

01:27:19.736 --> 01:27:20.936
Where is your science in that?

01:27:21.029 --> 01:27:23.489
Fine, then I will apologise.

01:27:24.198 --> 01:27:25.198
Go on, then.

01:27:25.283 --> 01:27:27.177
Although one could argue
that you owe me an apology...

01:27:27.201 --> 01:27:29.829
as my life has been threatened
by pirates and dead men.

01:27:29.996 --> 01:27:31.831
Which you now believe in,
sorry to say.

01:27:32.624 --> 01:27:34.250
Apology accepted.

01:27:35.835 --> 01:27:37.587
I'm going to the lookout.

01:27:38.004 --> 01:27:39.631
I'm glad you see it my way.

01:27:45.803 --> 01:27:47.972
Twelve degrees to port!

01:27:49.057 --> 01:27:50.683
- Ready the guns.
- Aye!

01:27:50.850 --> 01:27:51.684
Ready the guns!

01:27:51.851 --> 01:27:53.937
Those pirates are going
for the Trident.

01:28:08.660 --> 01:28:11.162
Where did you
get that from, missy?

01:28:11.329 --> 01:28:12.163
I know this book.

01:28:12.330 --> 01:28:15.500
Stolen from an Italian ship
many years ago.

01:28:15.833 --> 01:28:18.836
Stolen? No, you're mistaken.

01:28:19.003 --> 01:28:23.007
There was a ruby on the cover
I would not soon forget.

01:28:25.718 --> 01:28:27.345
This was given to me
by my father...

01:28:27.679 --> 01:28:29.681
who was clearly
a man of science.

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:33.726
He was clearly a common thief.

01:28:35.353 --> 01:28:37.355
The memory of my father
will not be defiled

01:28:37.438 --> 01:28:39.190
by the tongue of a pirate.

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:41.067
This diary is my birthright.

01:28:41.567 --> 01:28:44.195
Left to me on the steps
of a children's home.

01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:45.780
Along with a name
and nothing else.

01:28:46.447 --> 01:28:48.741
Oh, so you're an orphan.

01:28:49.283 --> 01:28:50.702
What be you called?

01:28:53.037 --> 01:28:55.707
Brightest star in the North
gave me my name.

01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:04.298
That would be Carina.

01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:05.550
Carina Smyth.

01:29:07.301 --> 01:29:09.137
So you do know your stars.

01:29:10.138 --> 01:29:11.723
I'm a captain.

01:29:15.226 --> 01:29:17.979
I know which stars
to follow home.

01:30:00.938 --> 01:30:02.106
Smyth.

01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:05.193
Smyth is quite
an unusual name.

01:30:06.694 --> 01:30:08.112
Did we not once...

01:30:08.279 --> 01:30:09.947
know someone called Smyth?

01:30:10.114 --> 01:30:11.699
Shut your trap.

01:30:11.866 --> 01:30:13.367
What was her name?

01:30:13.451 --> 01:30:16.245
It's right on the tip
of me tongue. Oh!

01:30:16.454 --> 01:30:17.654
Do you wanna lose that tongue?

01:30:17.789 --> 01:30:19.165
Margaret Smyth.

01:30:19.999 --> 01:30:21.042
Aye.

01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:23.002
Should we make an accord then?

01:30:23.169 --> 01:30:27.673
Or shall I tell you-know-who
what we both know to be true?

01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:30.468
We both take this secret
to our graves.

01:30:30.635 --> 01:30:32.303
You mean, it is true?
I was bluffing.

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:33.470
I'm not.

01:30:33.554 --> 01:30:36.849
You kill me, you got nothing
to bargain the dead with.

01:30:37.016 --> 01:30:39.310
So you need me.

01:30:40.061 --> 01:30:42.146
I'll have to be frank, Hector.

01:30:42.313 --> 01:30:44.357
You are very, very ugly.

01:30:44.982 --> 01:30:46.317
So how could you produce

01:30:46.484 --> 01:30:49.403
a fetching creature
such as that?

01:30:49.570 --> 01:30:51.239
Margaret died.

01:30:51.405 --> 01:30:52.698
I summoned as much honour

01:30:52.782 --> 01:30:54.742
as a worthless blaggard
ever could.

01:30:54.909 --> 01:30:56.828
I placed the infant
in an orphanage...

01:30:56.994 --> 01:30:58.371
never to see her again.

01:30:58.538 --> 01:31:00.248
I thought the ruby
might afford her

01:31:00.331 --> 01:31:01.499
some ease in life...

01:31:01.666 --> 01:31:04.460
but I never imagined
she'd take those scribblings...

01:31:04.627 --> 01:31:06.170
and make a life of her own.

01:31:07.255 --> 01:31:09.340
A life that's led her
back to me.

01:31:12.009 --> 01:31:13.678
I'd say this puts me

01:31:13.761 --> 01:31:16.681
in a rather favourable
position, Daddy.

01:31:16.848 --> 01:31:18.349
You tell me what you want.

01:31:18.516 --> 01:31:20.351
I want me compass.

01:31:20.518 --> 01:31:23.729
216 barrels of rum.

01:31:25.022 --> 01:31:26.440
And the monkey.

01:31:26.607 --> 01:31:27.692
You want Jack?

01:31:27.859 --> 01:31:30.361
Dinner. I want to eat him,
I want to eat that monkey...

01:31:31.112 --> 01:31:32.446
No deal, Jack.

01:31:32.613 --> 01:31:35.074
A clever young woman such
as that would never believe...

01:31:35.241 --> 01:31:38.911
that a swine like me
could ever be her blood.

01:31:41.455 --> 01:31:43.541
And the Trident will be mine.

01:31:54.719 --> 01:31:56.053
Redcoats!

01:31:57.054 --> 01:31:58.764
Redcoats!

01:32:01.392 --> 01:32:03.144
Prepare to fire!

01:32:03.311 --> 01:32:05.479
Prepare to fire!

01:32:05.646 --> 01:32:07.440
Man that gun!

01:32:12.486 --> 01:32:14.155
She comes starboard.

01:32:14.822 --> 01:32:16.908
We shall fight
to the last.

01:32:17.116 --> 01:32:20.077
The <i>Pearl</i> will not be taken
from me again.

01:32:25.082 --> 01:32:26.250
Sir.

01:32:31.130 --> 01:32:32.965
Only the British Empire

01:32:33.090 --> 01:32:34.842
will hold to
the power of the sea.

01:33:09.126 --> 01:33:12.463
Whatever happens,
stay your course.

01:33:38.155 --> 01:33:39.991
Jack Sparrow!

01:33:41.117 --> 01:33:43.077
Jack Sparrow.

01:33:43.160 --> 01:33:45.538
I've come
with a butcher's bill.

01:33:49.709 --> 01:33:51.043
Where is he?

01:33:53.713 --> 01:33:57.258
Defend yourselves, men.
To the death!

01:34:00.511 --> 01:34:01.762
Hurry up, man.

01:34:01.846 --> 01:34:03.347
What did you sharpen it with?
Butter?

01:34:23.993 --> 01:34:26.162
There's nowhere to hide.

01:34:42.219 --> 01:34:45.306
Let's be brave.
Save the <i>Pearl!</i>

01:34:53.898 --> 01:34:55.232
This has to be it.

01:34:58.194 --> 01:34:59.195
It has to be here.

01:34:59.653 --> 01:35:01.072
Find that land.

01:35:01.238 --> 01:35:02.406
Or we'll all die.

01:35:03.282 --> 01:35:04.575
We're nearly there!

01:35:05.618 --> 01:35:07.578
It's here somewhere.

01:35:24.762 --> 01:35:25.762
Oh!

01:35:42.279 --> 01:35:43.364
Ow.

01:36:02.508 --> 01:36:03.509
Ha!

01:36:15.396 --> 01:36:16.397
Whoa...

01:36:28.409 --> 01:36:30.329
Have you found what you're
looking for yet, miss?

01:36:30.494 --> 01:36:32.163
I'm trying!

01:36:36.083 --> 01:36:37.585
The stars will soon be gone.

01:36:53.058 --> 01:36:54.393
Whoa! Whoa!

01:37:07.531 --> 01:37:08.531
Carina!

01:37:09.283 --> 01:37:11.118
Henry, look!

01:37:11.285 --> 01:37:12.703
The island is there.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.121
You found it!

01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:26.217
The island.

01:37:32.223 --> 01:37:33.265
Land.

01:37:34.391 --> 01:37:36.227
Get to the <i>Mary!</i>

01:37:52.243 --> 01:37:53.410
Carina!

01:38:09.760 --> 01:38:11.095
Carina!

01:38:14.139 --> 01:38:15.224
Henry!

01:38:28.946 --> 01:38:29.989
They took Henry!

01:38:30.364 --> 01:38:32.866
The Trident be all
that can save him now.

01:38:33.033 --> 01:38:34.285
Then we have to find it.

01:38:54.555 --> 01:38:55.806
Where is it?

01:39:00.144 --> 01:39:01.895
It has to be here.

01:39:33.677 --> 01:39:35.095
Look at it, Jack.

01:39:36.055 --> 01:39:38.515
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:39:38.682 --> 01:39:40.893
This is what my father
wanted me to find.

01:39:41.060 --> 01:39:41.852
The rocks?

01:39:42.019 --> 01:39:43.520
No, not rocks.

01:39:43.937 --> 01:39:45.272
Stars.

01:39:45.939 --> 01:39:48.067
This is
<i>The Map No Man Can Read.</i>

01:39:49.234 --> 01:39:53.364
This island is a perfect
reflection of the heavens.

01:40:01.038 --> 01:40:02.038
One star's missing.

01:40:02.539 --> 01:40:03.539
Quickly!

01:40:04.458 --> 01:40:06.543
We have to find the Trident
to save Henry.

01:40:06.710 --> 01:40:08.712
Hector,
I think you should know,

01:40:08.796 --> 01:40:10.714
she's a horologist.

01:40:38.075 --> 01:40:39.618
Why isn't it glowing?

01:40:41.286 --> 01:40:43.080
Finish it, Carina.

01:40:49.336 --> 01:40:51.922
The missing star.

01:40:52.506 --> 01:40:53.799
For my father.

01:40:55.175 --> 01:40:56.176
Aye.

01:40:57.594 --> 01:40:59.304
Do it for him.

01:42:29.978 --> 01:42:30.978
Look.

01:42:31.897 --> 01:42:34.024
Poseidon's tomb.

01:42:34.316 --> 01:42:35.818
This way.

01:42:38.570 --> 01:42:40.423
<i>Capitán,</i> you know the danger.

01:42:40.447 --> 01:42:41.447
Don't do it.

01:42:41.532 --> 01:42:42.532
He has no choice.

01:42:42.574 --> 01:42:44.326
Jack is on land
going for the Trident.

01:42:44.493 --> 01:42:45.853
<i>Capitán,</i>
there must be another way.

01:42:45.994 --> 01:42:48.372
Once you possess the living,
there's no coming back.

01:42:48.539 --> 01:42:50.999
You will be trapped
in his body forever.

01:42:51.166 --> 01:42:53.168
The Trident will set me free.

01:42:55.838 --> 01:42:57.881
Time to kill a Sparrow.

01:42:58.048 --> 01:42:59.048
No!

01:43:12.563 --> 01:43:14.398
Look, Jack. There it is.

01:43:14.565 --> 01:43:16.692
The Trident.

01:43:22.739 --> 01:43:24.241
- Jack!
- Huh?

01:43:58.692 --> 01:44:00.611
Huh?

01:44:01.945 --> 01:44:04.156
You cut me,
you cut the boy, Jack.

01:44:39.983 --> 01:44:41.026
Henry!

01:45:13.809 --> 01:45:15.978
<i>Hola,</i> Sparrow.

01:45:16.895 --> 01:45:18.063
Oh, no.

01:45:29.658 --> 01:45:32.369
I hate the Sparrow.
Die, Sparrow.

01:45:39.584 --> 01:45:40.584
Henry!

01:45:41.003 --> 01:45:43.630
He's walking
on land. Please.

01:45:43.797 --> 01:45:45.507
Henry, wake up.

01:45:46.591 --> 01:45:48.051
Oh, piss off!

01:45:51.763 --> 01:45:53.306
Whoa!

01:45:58.020 --> 01:45:59.730
Henry, wake up.
He's killing Jack.

01:46:10.824 --> 01:46:11.825
Henry!

01:46:12.409 --> 01:46:13.409
Power of the sea.

01:46:13.535 --> 01:46:14.535
What?

01:46:14.786 --> 01:46:16.038
The power of the sea.

01:46:16.872 --> 01:46:18.290
"To release
the power of the sea...

01:46:18.457 --> 01:46:19.750
"all must divide."

01:46:26.590 --> 01:46:28.270
If the Trident
holds all the power, then...

01:46:28.425 --> 01:46:30.218
Then every curse
is held inside.

01:46:30.552 --> 01:46:33.472
As I told you before...

01:46:33.638 --> 01:46:36.433
surrender to me now
and I'll let you...

01:46:37.392 --> 01:46:38.393
live.

01:46:38.769 --> 01:46:40.103
You want me to surrender?

01:46:42.439 --> 01:46:43.523
Maybe.

01:46:43.899 --> 01:46:45.192
This is where the tale ends.

01:46:47.986 --> 01:46:48.986
No!

01:46:52.324 --> 01:46:53.450
Shh.

01:47:02.292 --> 01:47:03.292
Divide.

01:47:03.627 --> 01:47:04.627
Henry!

01:47:07.631 --> 01:47:08.799
Divide. Break.

01:47:08.965 --> 01:47:10.165
Break the Trident
and you'll...

01:47:10.300 --> 01:47:11.319
Break every curse
at sea.

01:47:59.599 --> 01:48:01.393
All curses are broken.

01:48:21.872 --> 01:48:24.291
We are flesh and blood!

01:48:41.266 --> 01:48:42.266
The <i>Pearl!</i>

01:48:42.434 --> 01:48:43.434
My <i>Pearl!</i>

01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.603
Climb!

01:48:44.769 --> 01:48:47.230
Move! Fast!

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:51.902
Hold it steady, boys!

01:48:52.068 --> 01:48:53.361
Don't let her slip!

01:48:58.491 --> 01:48:59.659
Jack!

01:49:01.620 --> 01:49:02.787
Jump!

01:49:02.954 --> 01:49:04.247
Faster!

01:49:17.219 --> 01:49:19.679
Up! Anchor!

01:49:19.846 --> 01:49:21.139
Get the anchor up! Quick!

01:49:21.681 --> 01:49:23.016
Stop! Stop! Bring it up!

01:49:23.183 --> 01:49:25.185
Bring it up! Bring it up!
Come on!

01:49:29.814 --> 01:49:31.441
Bring it up!

01:49:42.369 --> 01:49:44.162
<i>Capitán!</i>

01:49:44.579 --> 01:49:46.039
<i>Capitán!</i>

01:50:10.397 --> 01:50:11.856
Oh, crumbs!

01:50:19.197 --> 01:50:20.615
Whoa. Whoa.

01:50:30.500 --> 01:50:31.501
Oh!

01:50:33.670 --> 01:50:34.870
I've got you!

01:50:38.133 --> 01:50:39.134
Stronger.

01:50:56.901 --> 01:50:58.528
Who am I to you?

01:51:01.239 --> 01:51:02.574
Treasure.

01:51:13.877 --> 01:51:14.919
Hold on!

01:51:18.214 --> 01:51:19.549
Hector!

01:52:35.041 --> 01:52:37.001
Hold her starboard!

01:53:02.485 --> 01:53:05.238
Pirate's life, Hector.

01:53:40.690 --> 01:53:42.233
You all right?

01:53:43.359 --> 01:53:44.777
I don't know.

01:53:44.944 --> 01:53:47.780
For a moment,
I had everything, Henry.

01:53:49.574 --> 01:53:51.367
Now, it's all gone again.

01:53:51.534 --> 01:53:53.953
It's not all gone, Ms Smyth.

01:54:07.425 --> 01:54:08.760
Barbossa.

01:54:10.220 --> 01:54:11.930
My name is Barbossa.

01:54:53.972 --> 01:54:55.932
Maybe Jack was right.

01:54:56.099 --> 01:54:57.809
About what?

01:54:57.976 --> 01:54:59.310
The unscratchable itch.

01:55:03.231 --> 01:55:04.482
What did you do that for?

01:55:04.649 --> 01:55:06.442
Just checking it's truly you.

01:55:06.609 --> 01:55:08.152
That you're not still a ghost.

01:55:09.279 --> 01:55:10.279
It's me.

01:55:10.488 --> 01:55:11.614
Then I was...

01:55:11.781 --> 01:55:12.782
Wrong.

01:55:12.949 --> 01:55:14.909
Slightly in error. Although...

01:55:22.292 --> 01:55:23.835
Apology accepted.

01:55:37.432 --> 01:55:38.641
The <i>Dutchman.</i>

01:56:14.302 --> 01:56:15.303
Henry.

01:56:16.387 --> 01:56:17.472
Yes, Father.

01:56:26.522 --> 01:56:28.358
Let me look at you, son.

01:56:32.737 --> 01:56:34.072
How did you do it?

01:56:36.032 --> 01:56:37.325
How did you break the curse?

01:56:37.492 --> 01:56:39.160
Let me tell you a tale.

01:56:39.535 --> 01:56:41.829
A tale of the greatest
treasure known to man.

01:56:41.996 --> 01:56:43.998
That's a tale I wanna hear.

01:57:42.598 --> 01:57:44.434
What a truly revolting sight.

01:57:44.600 --> 01:57:45.600
Make way!

01:57:46.102 --> 01:57:47.937
Captain Jack Sparrow on deck!

01:57:48.604 --> 01:57:49.605
Indeed!

01:57:54.944 --> 01:57:56.130
Welcome back, Captain.

01:57:56.154 --> 01:57:58.072
Oh, thank you very much.
Coming through.

01:57:58.239 --> 01:57:59.240
Captain!

01:57:59.407 --> 01:58:00.241
Thank you.

01:58:00.408 --> 01:58:01.242
I remember you.

01:58:01.409 --> 01:58:02.618
Sirs. Thank you.

01:58:02.785 --> 01:58:04.787
Oh, good. Master Gibbs.

01:58:04.954 --> 01:58:06.622
The ship is yours,
Captain.

01:58:06.789 --> 01:58:07.874
Ah, thank you.

01:58:19.927 --> 01:58:21.137
Monkey.

01:58:28.269 --> 01:58:29.604
Thank you.

01:58:30.313 --> 01:58:32.648
What be our heading, Captain?

01:58:32.815 --> 01:58:35.610
We shall follow the stars,
Master Gibbs.

01:58:35.777 --> 01:58:38.404
Aye, aye, Captain!

01:58:43.951 --> 01:58:47.955
I have a rendezvous
beyond my beloved horizon.
