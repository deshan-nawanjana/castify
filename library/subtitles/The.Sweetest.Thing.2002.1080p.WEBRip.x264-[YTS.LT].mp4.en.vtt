00:00:27.527 --> 00:00:30.361
Christina Walters?

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:33.131
God, I haven't
heard that name in ages.

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.900
<i>You know the kind of woman</i>
<i> who can get any guy she wants?</i>

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:38.369
That's Christina Walters.

00:00:38.371 --> 00:00:40.438
We dated, you know,
briefly.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.074
But, uh, she's not
the commitment type.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:46.377
She's a player.
She just likes to have fun.

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.714
I met Christina at a bar.
Hot piece of ass.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.383
Totally hit it off.
All night long we dance.

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:55.586
I buy her drinks.
At the end of the night,

00:00:55.588 --> 00:00:57.422
she just splits.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:00.525
I lay down all that
groundwork for nothing.

00:01:00.527 --> 00:01:03.528
She gave me her number.
It's been like three days.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.534
Hello, and welcome
to aol moviefone.

00:01:09.536 --> 00:01:13.338
I stay up nights trying
to figure out why she said
she'd call and didn't.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.543
Maybe she wanted to call and
that's why she said she was
gonna call, but when she was--

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.211
¶ Christina ¶

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:23.781
¶ Christina ¶¶

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:27.251
you know, prolonged impotence
is very common
after a breakup.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:29.854
Lots of men suffer from it.

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.223
They just don't talk
about it, you know.

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:34.792
Not like me, gabbing away,
gab, gab, gab, gab.

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:38.129
But even still,
because she said
she was gonna call,

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.198
she should have called
to say she wasn't
gonna call.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.135
Then I would have thanked her
for calling to say
she wasn't gonna call.

00:01:44.137 --> 00:01:46.371
But hey, you know, at least
I don't get that dizzy,

00:01:46.373 --> 00:01:49.073
head-spinning nausea
as much as I used to.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.948
Yeah, you know, like I said,
I'm doing fine.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.685
I am fan-fucking-tastic!

Shake it if you got it.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.352
Miss Courtney.

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:37.488
Well, hello, miss Christina.
How you doing?
What you doing?

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.627
- Dancing too much.
How you doing?
- Same thing. How was your day?

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:47.732
Pretty good.
I got a new account designing
a campaign for a sports line.

00:02:47.734 --> 00:02:50.368
Well, they got the right
girl now, didn't they?

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.005
Ahh, thank you.
So, what's up?

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:58.176
Oh, you know, the usual.
Defending the rights
of my brokenhearted clients...

00:02:58.178 --> 00:03:03.014
And trying to squeeze
every single penny out of their
miserable, cheating spouses.

00:03:03.016 --> 00:03:04.949
You go get 'em, woman.
So, listen.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.885
I think I'm just gonna order
a pizza and stay in tonight.
How does that sound?

00:03:07.887 --> 00:03:11.289
Okay, but if we do that,
you know what's gonna
have to happen, huh?

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:16.027
Girl, I've been shaking my ass
all the way up this hill.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.963
Which track?
Track three.
Oh, yeah!

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:22.066
Coochie!

It's Jane.
She loves this song.

Kevin dumped me.

<i>It was just three days before</i>

00:03:59.272 --> 00:04:02.206
Oh, baby.
You know what, maybe
he just freaked out.

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:06.811
He is gonna call up tomorrow
when he realizes what
a huge mistake he made.

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:09.647
You know, he's probably
just going through that--
no!

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:13.618
<i>He says he's been wanting</i>
<i> this for six months. He says</i>
<i> he's been dying inside...</i>

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.688
<i>¶¶</i>
ever since I brought over
my garment bag.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.724
- Ouch.
- Honey.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:23.361
What?
You know,
we're all guilty of it.

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.363
You made yourself
too available.
Yeah.

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:27.565
It's a classic mistake,
sweetheart.
Uh-uh.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:30.568
Yeah.
Not according to this.

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.603
What is this?
Look.
"Commandment four."

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:35.740
<i> The ten commandments."</i>
Mm-hmm.

00:04:35.742 --> 00:04:40.244
Thou shall be open to
love's possibilities.

Boundaries are the enemy
of love."
<i>Sweetie.</i>

00:04:42.715 --> 00:04:47.185
Look it.
You know what? This book...
Is relationship propaganda.

00:04:47.187 --> 00:04:49.620
<i>Listen to me.</i>

00:04:49.622 --> 00:04:53.090
Dating is all
about boundaries.

00:04:53.092 --> 00:04:55.193
Honey, you have to
protect yourself.

00:04:55.195 --> 00:04:59.397
We've all had our hearts
stomped on one too
many times because...

00:04:59.399 --> 00:05:01.566
We went and
served it to them
on a big old platter.

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:04.569
<i> A good defense</i>
<i> is the best offense.</i>

00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.538
I am so tired
of playing games.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.413
<i>Honey, you can't just throw</i>
<i> yourself out there all exposed</i>
<i> and vulnerable every time.</i>

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:18.916
That is how you get
smacked down.
Do you understand?

00:05:18.918 --> 00:05:23.621
Don't go looking for Mr. Right.
Look for Mr. Right now.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.990
And eventually,
if he's worthy,

00:05:25.992 --> 00:05:31.028
<i>then one day that "now" part</i>
<i> is just going to...</i>

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.332
Drop away... naturally,
you know?

00:05:34.334 --> 00:05:37.935
<i>Meanwhile, you're just</i>
<i> gonna have fun together.</i>

00:05:37.937 --> 00:05:41.505
Yeah, it's not so serious,
you know. Shake it off
a little bit.

00:05:41.507 --> 00:05:44.809
<i>Speaking of fun,</i>
<i> we are gonna take you out.</i>

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:46.510
What?
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

00:05:46.512 --> 00:05:49.547
We are taking you out.
You are gonna have a good time.

00:05:49.549 --> 00:05:53.451
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no. No!

00:05:53.453 --> 00:05:58.489

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.958

<i>Hello, Jane.</i>

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:53.611
Hey, hey. Look at shoulder,

00:06:53.613 --> 00:06:56.480

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:58.883
What's your name,

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:10.895
We're gonna go now.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.097
<i> Bye-bye!</i>

Chop, chop, chop, chop,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.079
Oh, my god.
It's like siegfried
and Roy or something.

00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:30.881
Martinis, ladies.
Oh, thank you.

00:07:30.883 --> 00:07:34.452
Compliments of the gentleman
at the bar.
Which one?

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:40.358
Whoa. Thank you,
leather coat guy.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.526
Cheers.

00:07:42.528 --> 00:07:46.530
Hmm. Leather coat guy's
looking kind of good, huh?

00:07:46.532 --> 00:07:48.866
Yes, he is.
Shotgun!

00:07:48.868 --> 00:07:50.534

00:07:58.211 --> 00:08:00.911
Nothing.

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:06.050
Nothin'.
What's up with you?

00:08:07.153 --> 00:08:09.754
Nothing.
What's up with you?

00:08:09.756 --> 00:08:12.156
Nothin'.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:17.194
You know, I am having
the best time.
Are you, sweetie?

00:08:17.196 --> 00:08:20.998
My boyfriend just dumped me,
I'm here at this club where
no one wants to talk to me...

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.568
And I wanna go home.
No!

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:27.438
No, Christina,
I can't do this.

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.840
Yes, you can.
It's really very easy.

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.776
Observe.

00:08:33.413 --> 00:08:36.380
Ow!
I just pinched his ass.

00:08:36.382 --> 00:08:39.683
I'm sorry. Hi.
Hi. What's your name?

00:08:42.522 --> 00:08:44.855
Jane would love
to dance.
Hey.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:46.957
Uh, Jane, I don't mean
to be rude,

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.393
but I have some friends
who are waiting for me.
¶ dancing together ¶

00:08:49.395 --> 00:08:52.797

00:08:52.799 --> 00:08:56.300
oh, he hated me. I suck.
You do not suck.
That guy was a dick.

00:08:56.302 --> 00:09:00.371
Look, I'm gonna make sure
you have fun tonight
if it's the last thing--

00:09:00.373 --> 00:09:03.407
I'm sorry.
What did you just call me?

00:09:03.409 --> 00:09:05.643
Yeah.

00:09:05.645 --> 00:09:08.946
You just called me a dick.
I heard you. Why am I a dick?

00:09:08.948 --> 00:09:12.183
Uh, well, because you--
I don't like the way
you treated my friend.

00:09:12.185 --> 00:09:15.019
Well, I didn't do
anything to your friend.
Well--

00:09:15.021 --> 00:09:17.321
- hi.
-<i> You barely gave her</i>
<i> the time of day.</i>

00:09:17.323 --> 00:09:20.925
Uh, no. You tried to pawn me
off on her and I didn't go
for it. That makes me a dick?

00:09:20.927 --> 00:09:25.463
Pawn you off? You should be
so lucky to even talk to someone
as hot and sweet as Jane.

00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:29.333
-<i> Well, excuse me.</i>
- Hey, I wasn't suggesting that
the two of you get married.

00:09:29.335 --> 00:09:31.101
I just thought maybe
you could get it on.

00:09:31.103 --> 00:09:33.571
What? "Get it on?"
I was trying
to do you a favor.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.540
You know nothing about me.
What if I'm some psycho
serial killer?

00:09:36.542 --> 00:09:39.777
And what if Jane was
the girl of your dreams?
But you'll never know.

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.946
That is the sweetest thing.

00:09:41.948 --> 00:09:45.182
Never thought I'd meet the girl
of my dreams by having somebody
grab me in a bar and say,

00:09:45.184 --> 00:09:47.685
"hey, you, man,
I have good woman for you.

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.753
"She is very hot and sweet.
She is there.

00:09:49.755 --> 00:09:52.656
Jane, you dance for the man!"
Wait.

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:54.458
Maybe that's your problem.
Wait. What's my problem?

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:57.895
Maybe if you didn't play it
so safe, Mr. Safety poo,
hey.

00:09:57.897 --> 00:10:00.431
You might actually
meet a girl that you
could have fun with.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:04.768
And this brilliant love advice
comes from someone who loves
to play games with men,

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:08.506
always in control, that way
she never has to get too close.

00:10:08.508 --> 00:10:11.642
Nice manners, by the way.

00:10:15.014 --> 00:10:18.716
Where the hell did
that guy-- Jane? Jane?

00:10:22.488 --> 00:10:25.990
Nothin'.
What's up with you?

00:10:25.992 --> 00:10:28.259
I can't believe
you grabbed his ass.

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:31.428
But he comes right into my face
and he starts telling me
all this stupid stuff...

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.500
About how I like to play games
and always be in control
so I never get too close.

00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:40.304
<i>What?</i>
<i> it's just...</i>

00:10:40.306 --> 00:10:42.940
I've never seen you
act like this before,
that's all.

00:10:42.942 --> 00:10:45.442
Act like what?
They're fake.

00:10:45.444 --> 00:10:48.546
<i> All bah-jiggity</i>

00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:50.915
- You're calling me
"bah-jiggity?"
- Yeah.

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:53.918
- I'm really sorry.
I didn't mean to stare.
- That's cool.

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.654
- That's why I got 'em.
- I'm not bah-jiggity.

00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:59.089
- You are so bah-jiggity.
- They look real.

00:10:59.091 --> 00:11:01.692
Oh, thank you.
You can touch it if you want to.

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:04.562
- No, no, no, no.
- Touch it. She likes it.

00:11:04.564 --> 00:11:07.031
It's fine. Go ahead.
Feels real, huh?

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:09.533
If I'm bah-jiggity
about this guy Peter,

00:11:09.535 --> 00:11:11.535
it's only because
you're telling me I am.

00:11:11.537 --> 00:11:14.071
Oh, my god.
What?

00:11:14.073 --> 00:11:16.640
You've named the puppy.
I did not.

00:11:16.642 --> 00:11:18.375
You just called him Peter.
I did?

00:11:18.377 --> 00:11:20.978
Shelly, you've got to come over
and feel these things.

00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:23.914
- I'm psychic and I just knew that his name was Peter.
- -<i> Do you mind if I?</i>

00:11:23.916 --> 00:11:26.283
Knock your socks off.
Okay.

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:29.186
So soft.
Un-fucking-believable!

00:11:33.593 --> 00:11:36.727
What did I tell you?
That's why chicks always
go to the bathroom together.

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:41.332
Chris, it's so obvious that you
like this guy. Why are you
being such a pussy about it?

00:11:41.334 --> 00:11:44.835
Why are you making such
a big deal out of it?
If you haven't noticed,

00:11:44.837 --> 00:11:46.971
there's plenty of guys
out there.

00:11:46.973 --> 00:11:50.574
- Mm-hmm.
- See ya later.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:55.913
What's your problem?
What's<i> your</i> problem?

00:11:59.585 --> 00:12:01.719
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.256
- Hey, Peter.
- Huh?

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:12.863
- Eric, hey.
<i>- Be right there, Christina.</i>

00:12:12.865 --> 00:12:15.366
You don't have to do this.
I mean, it's--

00:12:15.368 --> 00:12:19.637
I know, but I want to.
I spilled your drink. Can I
please buy you another one?

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:22.873
Okay. Listen, uh,
I wanna apologize now.

00:12:22.875 --> 00:12:25.476
I... shouldn't have been
impolite to your friend.

00:12:25.478 --> 00:12:29.980
And if I was, I didn't mean
to be. It's just my brother
is waiting for me.

00:12:29.982 --> 00:12:33.050
I got nervous.
I don't know.
But i-- not that--

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:35.052
I mean, otherwise I'd be
all over your friend.

00:12:35.054 --> 00:12:39.156
I--
I'm the one who should
apologize. I was rude.

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.461
No, you were protecting
your friend. Anybody
would have done that.

00:12:44.463 --> 00:12:47.464
I thought that was sweet.

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:50.300
Excuse me.
Pardon me.

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:53.404
Jesus.
So are we good now?

00:12:53.406 --> 00:12:55.172
Yeah.
Good.

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:57.675
Well, I should probably
get back to my friends.

00:12:57.677 --> 00:12:59.543
Okay.

00:12:59.545 --> 00:13:01.679
Um, thanks for the drink.

00:13:01.681 --> 00:13:03.480
Cheers.

00:13:03.482 --> 00:13:06.450
Cheers.

00:13:06.452 --> 00:13:08.686
Have a good night.
You too.

00:13:10.389 --> 00:13:13.891
<i>¶¶</i>

00:13:15.895 --> 00:13:20.097
excuse me. Can you
take this? I just totally
struck out with this guy.

00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:25.269
One more thing. Should I be
upset my ex-girlfriend has her
tongue down that guy's throat?

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:29.306
Oh, my god!
Jane!

00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:32.543
- I guess I blew my chance, huh?
- Yeah, that could've been you.

00:13:32.545 --> 00:13:35.212
Yeah, if I weren't
such a dick.

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:37.081
A dick?
Was I really a dick?
Yeah, yeah.

00:13:37.083 --> 00:13:39.283
Really?
You were a dick.

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:44.021
Wow. Maybe we should start over
again. Why don't I walk by,
you grab me like you did before.

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:45.856
I didn't grab you.
You totally grabbed me.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:48.125
I did not.
I pinched you.
You grabbed me on the ass.

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:51.462
You grabbed-- okay.
I don't grab.

00:13:51.464 --> 00:13:53.864
Pete! Pete!
Dude!

00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:56.166
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:13:56.168 --> 00:13:58.635
Dude, where you been?
Everybody's waiting.

00:13:58.637 --> 00:14:02.940
After-hours party
back at the hotel.
These two pigs are good to go.

00:14:02.942 --> 00:14:06.910
Did I mention that we have
the Freddie Mercury suite?

00:14:06.912 --> 00:14:09.413
- Hey!
- <i> She puked on him!</i>

00:14:09.415 --> 00:14:13.650
Again!
God, she's like a hose.
Go help her, please.

00:14:13.652 --> 00:14:18.322
Or not. All right, she's out.
So, we're one short.
Who's this chick?

00:14:18.324 --> 00:14:20.557
No. No, no, no, no.
Oh, she is hot.
Bring her.

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:23.427
- What?
- Fuck me, don't say no.

00:14:23.429 --> 00:14:27.731
You have so much--
ow! You've gotta say yes.
Let me tell you why.

00:14:27.733 --> 00:14:31.401
You're never gonna find
anyone better than my brother.
He is the greatest.

00:14:31.403 --> 00:14:33.470
Okay. Okay.
And I am sure--
that hurts me.

00:14:33.472 --> 00:14:36.774
<i>Now, just-- just look at him.</i>
<i> Chicks freak on this guy.</i>

00:14:36.776 --> 00:14:38.809
He is-- come on now.
He is the shit.

00:14:38.811 --> 00:14:42.579
<i>- And that's why he's</i>
<i> in my wedding on Saturday.</i>
- Rog. Rog, no.

00:14:42.581 --> 00:14:45.449
Yes. Just trying
to help out.
No.

00:14:45.451 --> 00:14:47.151
Yeah, yeah, yeah--
bye.

00:14:47.153 --> 00:14:49.753
Whoa!
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:14:49.755 --> 00:14:53.590
Hey, listen, ladies.
Big party, four seasons,
room 402. You're invited.

00:14:53.592 --> 00:14:55.626
Let's go, baby.
Come on. You're out.
I'm leaving.

00:14:55.628 --> 00:14:58.328
<i>I'm leaving.</i>
<i> Are you following me?</i>
That's my brother.

00:14:58.330 --> 00:15:02.666
- Oh, he's special.
- Careful. That's puke.
It's puke. Don't touch me.

00:15:02.668 --> 00:15:05.002
Wow. So, when's
the wedding?

00:15:05.004 --> 00:15:08.105
Uh, Saturday afternoon
up in somerset.

00:15:08.107 --> 00:15:10.941
- That's where we live.
- That's nice.

00:15:10.943 --> 00:15:13.610
Peter, it's looking like now.
Okay, okay.

00:15:13.612 --> 00:15:15.712
You're pinching
my arm skin.

00:15:15.714 --> 00:15:18.382
Okay, I'd better go.

00:15:18.384 --> 00:15:21.885
<i>For real this time.</i>
Well, it was nice
to meet you.

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:25.556
- It was very nice to meet you.
I had a great time.
- Yeah? Me too.

00:15:25.558 --> 00:15:29.026
- You should definitely come
by the party if you want to.
- Really?

00:15:32.531 --> 00:15:36.800
I really hope I see you.
But in case I don't see you,
have a nice life.

00:15:36.802 --> 00:15:39.469
You too.

00:15:39.471 --> 00:15:42.573
<i>¶¶</i>

00:15:48.647 --> 00:15:52.716
Hey, Chris, it's court.
So I'm at the party
with leather coat guy.

00:15:52.718 --> 00:15:55.919
And I was just checking in
to see if you were listening
to your messages.

00:15:55.921 --> 00:15:58.422
'Cause if you are listening
to your messages,

00:16:03.028 --> 00:16:05.662
<i>you are a loser.</i>
<i> A los--</i>

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:08.465
thanks, court.

00:16:08.467 --> 00:16:11.235
<i>I'm a big loser.</i>

00:16:11.237 --> 00:16:14.104
<i>¶ What's up, you bitches</i>
<i> and hos and losers ¶</i>

00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:16.573
<i>¶ losers are-- ¶¶</i>

00:16:22.314 --> 00:16:24.581
Too late now.

00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:41.465
Funny.

00:16:44.036 --> 00:16:46.436
Really funny.

00:16:49.708 --> 00:16:51.909
Cute boy.

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:15.899
Oh, my god.
You're so good at that.

00:17:15.901 --> 00:17:19.536
If you don't mind, I'd like
to do that every hour on the
hour for the rest of our lives.

00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:22.439
Of course.
Go right ahead.
Thank you.

00:17:22.441 --> 00:17:25.676
Don't worry about returning
the favor. Men don't
really like oral sex.

00:17:25.678 --> 00:17:28.478
Yeah, right.
I'm serious!

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.081
It's just a bad rumor
that was started sometime
in the '50s.

00:17:31.083 --> 00:17:34.384
I had no idea.
I need to tell
all my friends.

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:38.722
Please, do.
Someone needs to put
an end to this madness.

00:17:43.395 --> 00:17:47.597
Oh, god. I'm so glad
I came back to the hotel room.

00:17:47.599 --> 00:17:49.599
God.
Me too.

00:17:50.869 --> 00:17:53.070
I never thought
I'd see you again.

00:17:55.007 --> 00:17:57.441
Room service.

00:17:57.443 --> 00:17:59.409
Oh, right on time.

00:17:59.411 --> 00:18:03.513
<i> Ice cream!</i>
Only the best for our v.I.P.S.

00:18:03.515 --> 00:18:06.616
I had them remove
all the calories for you.

00:18:06.618 --> 00:18:10.020
Oh, you are good.

00:18:10.022 --> 00:18:12.155
All right!

00:18:12.157 --> 00:18:15.792
I know I said I wanted to do it
to you every hour on the hour,
but I really can't wait.

00:18:15.794 --> 00:18:18.161
Can I do it again now?

00:18:18.163 --> 00:18:20.664
Okay.

00:18:21.834 --> 00:18:24.001
Wow.

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:11.515
San Francisco, California,
please, for, um,
four seasons hotel. Thanks.

00:19:11.517 --> 00:19:13.450
Thank you.

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:16.620
Great dream.

00:19:16.622 --> 00:19:19.089
Yes, hi.

00:19:19.091 --> 00:19:23.493
Um, do you have
a Freddie Mercury suite?

00:19:23.495 --> 00:19:27.197
Oh, good.
Can I have it?
Thanks.

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:32.436
Really? Already?

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:36.706
Okay, have a great day.
Thanks. Bye.

00:19:39.511 --> 00:19:43.713
Well, what am I
even calling for?

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.253
Hello?

00:19:50.255 --> 00:19:53.056
Hey, court.
Yeah.

00:19:53.058 --> 00:19:56.193
<i>¶¶</i>

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:12.242
Hey. Hey. Stop talking
shit about me, all right?

00:20:12.244 --> 00:20:15.445
Well, where you been?
Sorry I'm late, you guys. I
don't even wanna talk about it.

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:18.348
You ready?
I'm starving.
Okay.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:20.283
You know what? I'm just
gonna meet you guys in there.

00:20:20.285 --> 00:20:24.154
- I have to drop something
off at the dry cleaners.
- Can it wait? Please?

00:20:24.156 --> 00:20:28.391
-<i> I'm so hungry right now.</i>
- Isn't that Courtney's dress
that you borrowed last night?

00:20:28.393 --> 00:20:31.528
- Yeah.
- Why are you bringing it in?

00:20:34.133 --> 00:20:37.667
No. I'm just trying
to be a good girlfriend--

00:20:40.005 --> 00:20:41.938
I'm really sorry.

00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:44.508
You slut.
Guilty.
Is that what I think it is?

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:47.077
I will take it
to the dry cleaners
and it will be gone.

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:50.480
That's a lot.
<i> He was holdin' a lot.</i>

00:20:54.052 --> 00:20:58.054
I'm scared enough
to go in there.
What am I gonna say?

00:20:58.056 --> 00:21:01.191
Mr. Martin, can you help me
with my jizz?

00:21:04.062 --> 00:21:06.296
You know what?

00:21:06.298 --> 00:21:08.832
You guys... suck.

00:21:08.834 --> 00:21:10.667
No, obviously, you suck.
You.

00:21:10.669 --> 00:21:13.703
<i>You suck.</i>
<i> Really, wow. I'm proud.</i>

00:21:15.607 --> 00:21:18.909
No spanky wanky.

00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:21.211
No spanky wanky.

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.870
Hi, Jane.
Hi, Mr. Martin.

00:21:46.872 --> 00:21:50.607
- How's your mother?
- Great. Oh, god, she's good.
Everyone's good. Thank you.

00:21:50.609 --> 00:21:53.743
- Your grandmother?
- Everyone's great.

00:21:53.745 --> 00:21:56.913
That's fine. That's fine.
What you got for me today?

00:21:56.915 --> 00:22:01.284
Oh, just a dress,
but I'll be back for it
in a few days. So no hurry.

00:22:01.286 --> 00:22:04.254
- Any stains?
- No.

00:22:10.596 --> 00:22:13.263
This is gonna be
a tough one.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.837
Oh, wow, I didn't even
notice that. I must've spilled
some soda on me last night.

00:22:20.839 --> 00:22:25.542
No, no, this is not soda.
Think, Jane. Think!

00:22:25.544 --> 00:22:29.579
If I know what it is,
it's easier for me to remove.

00:22:29.581 --> 00:22:32.616
- Huh?
- -<i> Come on.</i>

00:22:32.618 --> 00:22:35.585
Ah, the field trip.
Come in, children.
Come in.

00:22:35.587 --> 00:22:38.888
Come in.
Yes, yes, come in.
Fuck!

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:42.192
Good afternoon,
Mrs. Franklin.
<i> Hi, Mr. Martin.</i>

00:22:42.194 --> 00:22:45.428
Okay, now on today's
field trip,

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:49.032
we are going to learn
about cleanliness.

00:22:49.034 --> 00:22:53.069
Jane?

00:22:53.071 --> 00:22:54.671
Hey.
Jane burns!

00:22:54.673 --> 00:22:57.741
Oh, sweetheart,
I haven't seen you
since I taught you...

00:22:57.743 --> 00:23:00.644
In third grade!

00:23:03.615 --> 00:23:08.518
-Top of the morning, Mr. Martin.
-Hello, father Flynn.

00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:11.621
As I live and breathe,
isn't it?

00:23:11.623 --> 00:23:15.025
It is little Mary Jane burns!

00:23:15.027 --> 00:23:18.862
<i> What a coincidence.</i>
<i> I'm having supper with</i>
<i> your parents tonight.</i>

00:23:18.864 --> 00:23:22.499
What a stain
you got there,
little Janie.

00:23:22.501 --> 00:23:24.301
So, how was it?
Was it fun?

00:23:24.303 --> 00:23:28.038
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
I can't believe I didn't
tell you this.

00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.708
<i>Apparently, one of the guys</i>
<i> who was at the party,</i>
<i> like, flipped out.</i>

00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:36.012
Was out on the balcony
and he was screaming
at the top of his lungs,

00:23:36.014 --> 00:23:42.118
"Christina! Has anyone seen
my little Christina?"

00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.555
And then he jumps off
the balcony and he dies
because you're a pussy.

00:23:45.557 --> 00:23:47.590
Why didn't you go?
I don't know.

00:23:50.929 --> 00:23:54.698
Then I don't know. I called him
at the hotel this morning.
Wait. Hold on.

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:58.802
Rewind for one second.
You called him at the hotel?

00:23:58.804 --> 00:24:02.038
- Well, what did he say?
- Nothing. He said nothing.

00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.040
Okay? Nothing.

00:24:04.042 --> 00:24:05.809
Why?
He checked out already.

00:24:05.811 --> 00:24:08.144
Okay, let's just sum this up
real quickly.

00:24:08.146 --> 00:24:10.580
<i>In the bathroom</i>
<i> we hate him,</i>

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:12.582
yet we call him by name.

00:24:12.584 --> 00:24:14.718
Then we throw beer on him.

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.388
Then we laugh and we flirt
and we danced with him.
It wasn't beer.

00:24:18.390 --> 00:24:20.824
Then we casually call him
at the hotel.

00:24:20.826 --> 00:24:23.960
Then we obsess
about the casual call.
Obsess?

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:27.330
I'm not obsessing.
I'm not obsessing.
I'm just wondering,

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:29.733
could all this erratic
behavior possibly be...

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.437
That you might really
like him?
No.

00:24:34.439 --> 00:24:37.807
You regret not going to this
party because you will never
know what might have happened?

00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:40.143
No, okay?
I don't regret it.

00:24:40.145 --> 00:24:44.314
If I had any regrets,
it would be this conversation
now, having it with you.

00:24:44.316 --> 00:24:47.517
- Can we just drop it?
- Okay, I'm sorry
I brought it up.

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:49.652
I won't mention it again.

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:55.725
- You know, even if I did regret
not going to the party,

00:24:55.727 --> 00:24:58.561
it's not like I can do
anything about it now.

00:24:58.563 --> 00:25:03.299
So, I mean, sometimes
you just have to...
Let these things go, right?

00:25:03.301 --> 00:25:06.369
Exactly.
Although,

00:25:14.346 --> 00:25:24.454
Like you could show up
at his brother's wedding,
'cause it is his brother.

00:25:37.569 --> 00:25:39.436
Come on!

00:25:39.438 --> 00:25:41.905
How much time we got?
We've got like three hours
before the rehearsal.

00:25:41.907 --> 00:25:43.740
Hit the ball.

00:25:43.742 --> 00:25:45.742
Oh, good shot.

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:50.413
<i> Fore!
</i> I'm gonna shove that club up your ass, you dick licker!

00:25:50.415 --> 00:25:52.715
What, are you up
by like two now?

00:25:52.717 --> 00:25:56.286
I guess.
Well, listen. It doesn't
get any better than this.

00:25:56.288 --> 00:25:58.288
To the marriage.
To the marriage.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:01.157
To-to-to the bride.
To the bride.

00:26:01.159 --> 00:26:04.427
- Yeah.
- To 50 years
with the same woman.

00:26:05.831 --> 00:26:07.931
That's really depressing.

00:26:07.933 --> 00:26:09.999
Sorry.

00:26:10.001 --> 00:26:12.635
Saggy tits.

00:26:12.637 --> 00:26:16.172
Be able to use them
as a belt by then.

00:26:16.174 --> 00:26:20.210
Or just tuck 'em
in her socks, you know.
Okay.

00:26:20.212 --> 00:26:24.180
God, this marriage is-is
such a big leap, you know.

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:27.016
- It's really intense, Pete.
- But if it's the right woman--

00:26:27.018 --> 00:26:30.253
yeah, I guess.

00:26:32.090 --> 00:26:34.791
Get up a little.
Yes. Fore!

00:26:34.793 --> 00:26:38.228
You motherfuckers!
Stop bothering me!

00:26:38.230 --> 00:26:40.463
You're driving
right into 'em.

00:26:40.465 --> 00:26:43.566
Hey, what about John?
I hear he's still awol
from that bachelor party.

00:26:43.568 --> 00:26:46.202
He showed up last night.
He's missing an eyebrow...

00:26:46.204 --> 00:26:48.271
And he's got a tattoo
on his ass that says "bitch."

00:26:48.273 --> 00:26:50.640
<i> Fore!</i>
I am not an animal!

00:26:50.642 --> 00:26:55.445
Very good. Oh, hey,
speaking of bitches.

00:26:55.447 --> 00:26:58.915
What was going on with you
that night at the club
with that hottie?

00:26:58.917 --> 00:27:01.484
- Nothin'.
- I mean, Jesus!

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:04.320
I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

00:27:07.158 --> 00:27:09.225
Yeah, you did.
Don't lie to me.
Hey, hey, hey.

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:12.328
Don't lie--
don't lie to darth, Luke.

00:27:17.602 --> 00:27:20.103
I can see it in your eyes
you liked her.

00:27:23.808 --> 00:27:25.909
Nothin' I can
do about it now.

00:27:25.911 --> 00:27:29.679
<i>Should have poked her</i>
<i> in the whiskers</i>
<i> when you had the chance.</i>

00:27:29.681 --> 00:27:32.382
What's that, gramps?

00:27:32.384 --> 00:27:34.884
I met this hot young dish...

00:27:34.886 --> 00:27:38.621
At the world's fair
back in 1940.

00:27:38.623 --> 00:27:43.426
<i>Every moment with her</i>
<i> was like a slice of heaven.</i>

00:27:43.428 --> 00:27:45.828
I bet you really
miss grandma, huh?

00:27:47.198 --> 00:27:49.198
Ah, fuck grandma.

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.467
- Huh?
- It's Pearl I'm talkin' about.

00:27:51.469 --> 00:27:54.404
<i>She was the love</i>
<i> of my life.</i>

00:27:54.406 --> 00:27:57.740
Don't ever let these moments
pass you by.

00:28:01.813 --> 00:28:04.581
Fuckin' grandma!

00:28:04.583 --> 00:28:07.216
Would you be nice?

00:28:07.218 --> 00:28:11.087
Come on, seven-six.

00:28:14.359 --> 00:28:17.360
Fore!

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.301
<i> ¶ The lights are off again ¶</i>

00:28:25.303 --> 00:28:29.205
<i>¶ she took me by surprise ¶</i>

00:28:29.207 --> 00:28:32.642
<i>¶ she's so sensitive ¶</i>

00:28:32.644 --> 00:28:35.745
<i>¶ it just should happen</i>
<i> sometimes ¶¶</i>

00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:37.680
you suck!

00:28:37.682 --> 00:28:40.683
Damn it.
But you smell
so minty fresh now.

00:28:40.685 --> 00:28:44.787
What do you want?
I need to borrow
your black Gucci bag.

00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:46.823
God--
here.

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:49.692
It's in the living room.
Okay, well, I don't know
where in the living room.

00:28:49.694 --> 00:28:52.462
And I don't feel like
looking for it, so let's go.
No.

00:28:52.464 --> 00:28:55.164
Will you help me find it,
please? Come on, please?

00:28:55.166 --> 00:29:00.603
Well, since I'm up now
and you decided to torture me,
I'll go and get it!

00:29:02.474 --> 00:29:04.874
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, my god. Excuse me.

00:29:04.876 --> 00:29:09.545
Um, could you guys tell me
where the bathroom is?
It's behind you.

00:29:09.547 --> 00:29:12.015
Over here? Oops.

00:29:12.017 --> 00:29:15.652
Uh--

00:29:15.654 --> 00:29:17.920
well, thanks.

00:29:17.922 --> 00:29:20.690
Oh, my cock.
Cock.

00:29:20.692 --> 00:29:24.127
Oh, my cock.
Oh, my cock.
Oh, my cock.

00:29:29.367 --> 00:29:31.934
Do you guys have
any advil?

00:29:31.936 --> 00:29:34.404
Oh!

00:29:34.406 --> 00:29:38.808
Janie.
He is so cute.

00:29:38.810 --> 00:29:41.911
So stupid.

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:45.448
Oh, babe.
Can I get that purse
now, please?

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.817
Yes, you can get the purse.
Okay.
No, now.

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.919
Here's the purse.

00:29:49.921 --> 00:29:51.821
Ah, thank you
very much.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.062
- Where are you going?
- You and I are going
to a wedding.

00:29:59.064 --> 00:30:01.330
What wedding?
Who's getting married?

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:04.100
We are going to Peter's
brother's wedding.

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:05.735
Peter?
<i>Now listen.</i>

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:09.405
This somerset place
where they live is
some small town...

00:30:13.244 --> 00:30:15.545
- P-Peter--
- what?

00:30:15.547 --> 00:30:18.848
Peter? I'm not going
to Peter's brother's wedding.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.718
What are you talking about?
Yesterday you said
you wanted to go.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.353
So I went and, you know--
Courtney.

00:30:24.355 --> 00:30:27.390
- I was joking.
- Oh, no, you weren't.

00:30:27.392 --> 00:30:29.592
Uh, yes, I was.

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:33.963
Fifty percent of what people say
when they're joking is true.

00:30:33.965 --> 00:30:38.134
Which means that you do
wanna go to this wedding, but
you're too afraid to admit it.

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:42.105
So by making some sort of joke
about it, you get to say
what you really want...

00:30:42.107 --> 00:30:44.140
Without being vulnerable.

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:46.509
Right?
Maybe.

00:30:46.511 --> 00:30:50.179
Okay, good.
The wedding starts at 5:00.
I refuse to be late.

00:30:50.181 --> 00:30:54.751
I want you to put some
clothes on now. Thank you.

00:30:54.753 --> 00:30:56.819
<i> That was a nice one.</i>
Thanks.

00:31:03.995 --> 00:31:07.163
<i>¶ Trying all this new stuff</i>
<i> trying to be fly ¶</i>

00:31:07.165 --> 00:31:10.399
<i>¶ there she goes again</i>
<i> slipping and sliding ¶¶</i>

00:31:13.271 --> 00:31:16.172
<i> that's it.</i>
<i> Once we get off the 140,</i>

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:20.243
- uh-huh.
- We'll take the 95,
get off on the somerset exit.

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:25.014
All right. Then we'll just
drive around and we can find
the church no problem. Ta-da!

00:31:28.787 --> 00:31:31.287
<i> Ew! What is that?</i>

00:31:31.289 --> 00:31:33.656
- What is what?
- You don't smell that?

00:31:33.658 --> 00:31:36.392
- Smell what?
I don't smell anything.
- Oh, Jesus!

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:39.796
- You're used to it.
That's what's really scary.
- I don't smell anything.

00:31:39.798 --> 00:31:43.099
It smells like moldy ass
is what it smells like in here.

00:31:43.101 --> 00:31:46.736
Wait a minute.
Come to think of it, I did
leave some ass in the back.

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:51.674
- You did.
- About a week ago, I did.
It must be the ass. No, no.

00:31:51.676 --> 00:31:53.776
- Sit down, please.
- Jesus!

00:31:53.778 --> 00:31:56.813
- I'm sorry.
- You're gonna kill--

00:31:56.815 --> 00:31:59.382
ow!

00:31:59.384 --> 00:32:01.651
- What are you doing?
- Jesus, Courtney.

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:04.253
-<i> What is all this--</i>
- no, no, no, stop.
Come on, please. Look, look.

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:07.623
Just-- just don't be throwing
out anything I might need, okay?

00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:11.761
Where is it coming from,
Courtney? Where?
I can still smell it.

00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:14.463
Maybe it's you.

00:32:14.465 --> 00:32:17.333
Did something crawl up
your poonani?
Hey.

00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:24.373
Yeah, well, you know what?
Neither have I, okay?

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:27.410
High five
on the clean poonani.
Bitch.

00:32:27.412 --> 00:32:30.413
- Oh. Ew.
- What?

00:32:30.415 --> 00:32:33.449
- Ew, ew, ew. What is this?
- What is what?

00:32:33.451 --> 00:32:38.154
- What is this?
- Oh! Jesus! I don't even know
how long it's been in here.

00:32:38.156 --> 00:32:40.923
What is in here?

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:46.162
No!

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:49.332
That is not okay!
It isn't okay!

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:54.337
You are a disgusting,
nasty pig. Do you understand?
There was maggots on that--

00:33:01.212 --> 00:33:04.947
Excuse me. I've got
maggot juice all over me.
There it is.

00:33:04.949 --> 00:33:07.383
Oh, please.

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:10.653
Ladies room.

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:13.122
<i> Someone's in here.</i>
Sorry.

00:33:13.124 --> 00:33:15.725
<i> It might be a while.</i>
How long?

00:33:15.727 --> 00:33:21.163
<i>Let me put it to you this way.</i>
<i> I had lamb curry last night,</i>
<i> and I'm shittin' out a buick.</i>

00:33:21.165 --> 00:33:23.132
Ew.

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:25.735
Was it absolutely vital
for her to tell us that?

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.481
Oh, god!
This is disgusting.

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:41.350
I feel like I have maggots
all over me.

00:33:41.352 --> 00:33:46.355
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Don't move. Don't move.

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.991
Oh, stop it!

00:33:48.993 --> 00:33:51.527
I'm gonna pee in my pants.

00:33:56.634 --> 00:34:00.770
<i> "There once was a man from</i>
<i> bandoo who fell asleep</i>
<i> in a canoe.</i>

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:03.406
<i>"He dreamed of Venus</i>
<i> and played with his penis...</i>

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:07.143
<i> And woke up</i>
<i> with a handful of... goo."</i>

00:34:07.145 --> 00:34:09.745
Wait! Don't make me laugh.
Dude, I gotta aim.

00:34:09.747 --> 00:34:12.348
Oh, god darn it.
I think I peed on myself.

00:34:12.350 --> 00:34:16.085
Hmm. "Follow
the yellow brick road?"

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:17.553
God!

00:34:17.555 --> 00:34:20.423
I'm following
the yellow brick road.

00:34:20.425 --> 00:34:22.425
Follow the yellow brick road.

00:34:24.796 --> 00:34:28.597
Buffy! You look like
my old doggy Buffy.

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:33.602
- Hello, girl.
I haven't seen you in--
- oh, my god! It's on my hands!

00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:37.473
<i> There's a good girl.</i>
<i> What you got, little girl?</i>
<i> Come on.</i>

00:34:37.475 --> 00:34:39.742
What you got?
What's in your mouth?

00:34:39.744 --> 00:34:43.045
- Damn it!
- What you got in there?

00:34:43.047 --> 00:34:44.981
- What's in there?
What's in your mouth?
- Crap!

00:34:44.983 --> 00:34:48.050
- What's in there?
- - Surprise!

00:34:53.992 --> 00:34:56.625
Oh, Christina!

00:34:59.397 --> 00:35:04.667
Goddamn it.
How could you not know
what a glory hole is?

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:07.103
Well, unlike my whore friend
Courtney rockliffe,

00:35:07.105 --> 00:35:11.007
I don't usually
spend much time in men's
public bathrooms, okay?

00:35:11.009 --> 00:35:15.911
Goddamn, that is the funniest
thing I have ever seen
in my entire life.

00:35:15.913 --> 00:35:18.814
I mean, I flew
across that room.

00:35:18.816 --> 00:35:21.150
And you got fucked
in the eye.

00:35:21.152 --> 00:35:25.287
I'm glad you find it so
fucking amusing, okay?
I really do.

00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:27.790
Could you please have
some compassion?
I do. I do.

00:35:27.792 --> 00:35:31.260
Because I could
go blind, okay?
No, you could not.

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:34.897
Yes, I could. Ow.
All right, let me look
at it, okay?

00:35:34.899 --> 00:35:37.800
I mean, a penis in my eye.
Wait, wait, wait.

00:35:37.802 --> 00:35:40.436
Let me see.
Let me see. Shh.

00:35:40.438 --> 00:35:43.005
Okay. All right.

00:35:43.007 --> 00:35:47.209
How is it? Is it okay?
Yeah, it's okay.

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:49.578
But I think you're pregnant.

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.681
Would you please
stop it already?
All right.

00:35:54.685 --> 00:35:57.853
<i>Now I want you</i>
<i> to redress the mannequins</i>
<i> and check the sock inventory.</i>

00:35:57.855 --> 00:36:00.923
Come on, Jane. It's Saturday
and nobody's here.
And Mr. Mooney--

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:05.694
Mr. Mooney is off sailing
with his boy toy which leaves me
in charge of the store, so shoo.

00:36:05.696 --> 00:36:08.164
Somebody needs
to get some.

00:36:14.772 --> 00:36:18.407
¶ La, la-la, la-la
la-la ¶¶

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:20.609
ooh, there's my dirty girl.

00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:23.979
Aah! No! No! No!

00:36:23.981 --> 00:36:26.148
It's me, baby!
It's me! It's me!

00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:29.285
Why are you dressed
like that?

00:36:29.287 --> 00:36:32.154
It's my job.
I work at
a children's hospital.

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:34.090
Oh, hi.
Hi.

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:38.994
You look so cute.

00:36:40.598 --> 00:36:43.732
I'm horny.
Me too.

00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:52.241
-You're gonna laugh at this one.
-What?

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:54.677
You know how I said I had
to do, uh, laundry today?

00:36:54.679 --> 00:36:58.414
It's 'cause I ran out of clean
underwear, honey. I've only got
the skanky ones left.

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:01.417
Tell me about it, dude.

00:37:01.419 --> 00:37:04.620
oh, my god.
You are so unbelievable.

00:37:07.859 --> 00:37:10.659
No way.
Is that what I think it is?

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:13.929
Spring break, 1994, baby.

00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:15.798

Oh, my god.

- Jane!

00:37:51.869 --> 00:37:54.837
You and I are
so awesome together.

00:37:54.839 --> 00:37:56.906
We're like two peas
in a pod.

00:37:56.908 --> 00:37:59.208
We're like oil and vinegar.
Shut up.

00:37:59.210 --> 00:38:02.444
Okay.
I can't believe
I'm fucking a purple elephant.

00:38:02.446 --> 00:38:06.715
What do you mean,
she's not here?
We have customers, missy.

00:38:06.717 --> 00:38:09.351
I'm sorry, Mr. Mooney.
I'll go check upstairs.

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:12.821
God, I'm gone for one day,
the place turns into Indonesia.

00:38:14.759 --> 00:38:17.793
- Oh, Jane. Oh, Jane.
- Jane?

00:38:17.795 --> 00:38:19.828
<i>Janie wanie. Janie wanie!</i>
Jane?

00:38:19.830 --> 00:38:22.765
Oh, my god. Are you okay?

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:25.000
- Yes, I'm fine.
- What is going on?

00:38:25.002 --> 00:38:27.870
Nothing. I'm just
a little frantic.

00:38:27.872 --> 00:38:31.240
<i> I have a million things</i>
<i> to do today. And I'm dizzy.</i>
<i> I'm so dizzy.</i>

00:38:31.242 --> 00:38:34.310
Well, Mr. Mooney is downstairs
and he is p-i-s-e-d.

00:38:34.312 --> 00:38:37.246
"Pised?"

00:38:47.258 --> 00:38:50.626
- Where have you been?
- I was upstairs
taking inventory.

00:38:50.628 --> 00:38:52.962
Yeah, my aunt Fanny.

00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:55.297
- Ew.

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:57.833
- Gallini's.
- Hello. Is Jane there?

00:38:57.835 --> 00:39:00.769
Yes, she is.
Have a lovely day.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:04.306
<i> Hello?</i>

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:06.942
Janie! Janie!

00:39:06.944 --> 00:39:09.979
Sorry, guys. I can't talk
right now. I'm really busy.

00:39:09.981 --> 00:39:12.181
We were just wondering--

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:17.419
<i>¶ do you like pina coladas</i>
<i> and getting caught</i>
<i> in the rain ¶¶</i>

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:19.822

00:39:39.110 --> 00:39:41.110
Oh, shit. Shit.
What?

00:39:41.112 --> 00:39:43.279
I dropped the-the thingy
to my lip gloss.

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:45.781
<i> Could you get it</i>
<i> for me, sweetie?</i>
I'll get it.

00:39:48.853 --> 00:39:52.054
It's too far over.
It's too far over.
I'll get it.

00:39:52.056 --> 00:39:56.191
Hold onto it.
Keep steering.
I'll keep going.

00:39:58.029 --> 00:40:00.562
- Yeah, it's right, I believe--
- hmm?

00:40:00.564 --> 00:40:03.799
Hoo!

00:40:08.673 --> 00:40:10.673
Oh, yeah.

00:40:10.675 --> 00:40:15.344
- Yeah, baby!
- Oh, yes.

00:40:15.346 --> 00:40:18.147
Yes!

00:40:18.149 --> 00:40:21.617
- Oh, yeah, right there.
- No, that's not it.

00:40:21.619 --> 00:40:24.887
Oh, you like that,
dirty girl?

00:40:24.889 --> 00:40:29.191
Whoo! Yes!
Let me have some of that!

00:40:29.193 --> 00:40:32.561
- Oh, yes, don't stop.
- I'm not gonna stop.

00:40:49.146 --> 00:40:50.913
Yes!

00:40:58.255 --> 00:40:59.722
Shit.

00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:03.692
Okay, I found it.
Jesus, I almost got
smothered down there.

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.728
Shit.
Are you okay?

00:41:05.730 --> 00:41:08.263
Huh?
You good?

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:11.333
Yeah, no, I'm good.
I'm good. Never better.
Never better.

00:41:11.335 --> 00:41:15.270
<i>Let's get on the same page</i>
<i> about what we're gonna say</i>
<i> once we get to the wedding.</i>

00:41:17.274 --> 00:41:20.075
<i> Walk up to him and be like,</i>
<i> "Peter, is that you?</i>

00:41:20.077 --> 00:41:22.911
<i> "Oh, my god.</i>
<i> My friend Courtney,</i>
<i> that hot babe over there,</i>

00:41:22.913 --> 00:41:26.281
she and I went to college
with the bride."
It's unbelievable.

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:28.784
Do you believe that?
No, I can believe that.

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:32.221
It's unbelievable.
Freaky!

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:35.557
<i> ¶ But love is in the air ¶</i>

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:43.465

Wow, wow, wow, wow.
Wow!
Oh, wow.

00:42:09.894 --> 00:42:13.929
Miss Vera's has plenty
to offer us, doesn't she?
Yes, plenty of crap.

00:42:13.931 --> 00:42:15.931
It's fabulous.
We don't have time for this.

00:42:15.933 --> 00:42:18.133
Okay, let's go.
All right.
Let's go.

00:42:18.135 --> 00:42:20.202
Welcome to my store.
Can I help you?

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.671
No, we were just browsing.
We're okay. Thanks.

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:24.840
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:27.075
Bye.
You don't like
my store, do you?

00:42:27.077 --> 00:42:29.611
No, no, that's not it
at all.
Oh, no, no.

00:42:29.613 --> 00:42:34.116
<i>- It's really a lovely store.</i>
<i> We're looking for something--</i>
- a little bit more specific.

00:42:34.118 --> 00:42:37.853
The next dress store
is 20 miles from here.

00:42:37.855 --> 00:42:40.589
Twenty miles away?
Oh, shit.

00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:44.193
- We're gonna miss
the wedding. Perfect.
- Judy webb's wedding?

00:42:44.195 --> 00:42:47.663
I know all about it.
I dressed half the guests.

00:42:47.665 --> 00:42:52.367
You know, when I was 22,
my "breastuses" were, like,

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:56.705
right about there,
nice and perky.

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:59.808
Gravity has taken them
to there.

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.545
It's, like, 22... 28.

00:43:03.547 --> 00:43:05.614
Twenty-two. Twenty-eight.

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.984
- Twenty-two... twenty-eight.
<i>- Buy some new ones.</i>

00:43:08.986 --> 00:43:12.554
Okay, wait, but wait.
This is-- j-- wait.
No, no, no, no. Look it.

00:43:12.556 --> 00:43:17.626
What is this?
What is it? What is that?
No, no, no. But what is that?

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:21.096
That, again, is... gravity.
Hello. Hi. How are you?

00:43:21.098 --> 00:43:25.634
Knock, knock.
Are you decent?
<i> Yeah. Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:28.303
Thank you.
You're going to love this.
It's our latest line.

00:43:28.305 --> 00:43:31.940
Oh, wow.
If you need other sizes,
just holler.

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:34.843
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Vera.

00:43:34.845 --> 00:43:37.045
Wow. Excellent.

Look.
That's nice.

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:44.786
Wait a minute.

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:50.092

Sure.

Sure. Right here?
Sure.

Mm. It sure is.
Thank you. Bye.

We've gotta go. You okay?
Oh, shit! Oh, my god.
I can't walk in this thing.

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:25.120
It's painful, like bondage.
Little steps, little steps.

00:45:25.122 --> 00:45:28.323
We don't
have a lot of time.

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:32.794

Oh!

No, it isn't.

We are not gonna be able
to walk into a wedding--
come on. It's very la toya.

I mean, really,
look at all this--

00:45:52.516 --> 00:45:56.251
I may as well
strap a sign on my ass
that says "stalker."

00:45:56.253 --> 00:46:00.722
Okay?
I am not going there
wearing this outfit.

00:46:00.724 --> 00:46:03.558
So can we please just go?
Yes. Let's go.
Let's go home.

00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:07.629
Really?
Yeah. I mean, we've driven
for three and a half hours...

00:46:07.631 --> 00:46:10.832
And everything,
but, no, let's go.

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:13.935
Please. Please.
I'm serious.
Let's go. Really. Let's go.

00:46:13.937 --> 00:46:18.240
- Don't "reverse psychology" me
right now, okay?
- I'm not.

00:46:23.914 --> 00:46:26.882
Court, this is crazy, okay?
This is really crazy.
I know, I know, I know.

00:46:26.884 --> 00:46:31.820
What the hell were we thinking?
I just wish there was
some sort of sign from god...

00:46:31.822 --> 00:46:34.289
That you and this Peter donahue
guy are supposed to be together.

00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:37.325
Donahue? How do you know
his last name is donahue?

00:46:37.327 --> 00:46:39.594
Because you're sitting
on his face.

00:46:42.866 --> 00:46:46.535
- Oh, my god, it's him!

I don't know.
I can't answer that

are gonna be really happy
together.

yes! Oh, Janie! Yes!

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:24.685
¶ The sweetest thing
will never do ¶

01:00:24.687 --> 01:00:29.690
¶ I still miss you, baby
and I don't wanna
miss a thing ¶¶

01:00:29.692 --> 01:00:34.061
¶ how do I live
without you ¶

01:00:34.063 --> 01:00:37.598
¶ I want to know ¶¶
what?

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.800
It was milli.
It was vanilli.

01:00:39.802 --> 01:00:41.869
Oh, whatever.
No. Not "whatever."

01:00:41.871 --> 01:00:46.641
So she says to him,
"girl, you know it's true"
changed my life.

01:00:46.643 --> 01:00:50.044
It did, okay? I'm sorry.
A tear-- just a sad
little tear slowly--

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:53.281
<i> oh, come on.</i>
<i> What do you want from me?</i>
<i> I was 16 years old.</i>

01:00:53.283 --> 01:00:57.451
<i> Okay? I don't even</i>
<i> know why I started talking</i>
<i> to her in the second grade.</i>

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:59.954
- I swear, I don't.
- Because you thought
I was the shit.

01:00:59.956 --> 01:01:03.758
- You are the shit.</i>
- Shithead.

01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:06.827
- Oh, my god.
- What?

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:10.431
<i> They found a donor</i>
<i> for my patient. Okay.</i>
<i> I gotta go. Sorry, guys.</i>

01:01:10.433 --> 01:01:13.434
- You know what, Christina?
It was great meeting you.
- It was nice to meet you, Greg.

01:01:13.436 --> 01:01:16.604
- Jane, it was great meeting you.
- Great meeting you.

01:01:16.606 --> 01:01:20.541
-So sorry I have to run off.
I'll make you Risotto tomorrow.
-It's fine.

01:01:20.543 --> 01:01:23.945
- <i> It's good.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Bye.

01:01:23.947 --> 01:01:28.049
- Okay, can I just say,
that was so sweet?
- He's great.

01:01:28.051 --> 01:01:32.620
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.
- He's so sweet.
- He doesn't have piercings?

01:01:32.622 --> 01:01:34.622
No.

01:01:34.624 --> 01:01:38.259
Um, I don't know, actually,
because, um,

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:43.331
<i>I haven't done that</i>
<i> with him yet, so, you know--</i>

01:01:43.333 --> 01:01:49.537
oh, you really do like him.
I don't wanna talk about it,
'cause I'm gonna jinx it, so--

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:52.440
ohh.

01:01:52.442 --> 01:01:57.445
<i>¶ And it's</i>
<i> a strange condition ¶</i>

01:01:57.447 --> 01:02:00.681
<i>¶ a day in prison ¶</i>

01:02:00.683 --> 01:02:02.817
<i>¶ it's got me</i>
<i> out of my head ¶</i>

01:02:02.819 --> 01:02:07.488
<i>¶ and I don't know what</i>
<i> I came here for ¶</i>

01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:11.492
<i>¶ oh, I want you to know ¶</i>

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.656
<i>¶ It's a strange condition ¶</i>

01:02:45.728 --> 01:02:47.962
hey.
<i>¶ it's got me out of my head</i>
<i> and I don't know ¶¶</i>

01:02:47.964 --> 01:02:50.831
I closed
on the mahalock house today.
Great news for you.

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:56.671
You don't need to do a thing.
What did they say
about my aluminum siding?

01:02:56.673 --> 01:02:58.572
No.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:01.942
Really?
Really. Be careful
with those fat-free chips.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:06.147
They cause anal leakage.
You cause anal leakage.

01:03:06.149 --> 01:03:09.283
It says so on the bag.

01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:22.229
What-- what kind of
marketing brainiac puts
"anal leakage" on his product?

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:25.499
How can they even
sell that crap?

01:03:25.501 --> 01:03:27.835
What time's your flight?
9:30.

01:03:29.472 --> 01:03:32.406
I can't believe you're
going to Costa Rica.

01:03:32.408 --> 01:03:36.077
- You know, your female problems
are completely over with.
- Hope so.

01:03:39.749 --> 01:03:42.216
- For five pesos--
- no, no. Rog, rog.

01:03:42.218 --> 01:03:46.587
- They take your Chimichanga
and your<i> poquito--</i>
-<i> no, no, seсor. Seсor--</i>

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:48.823
listen to me.
<i>No. No quiero.</i>

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:53.227
All I'm sayin' is make nice
with the concierge, okay?

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:04.271
Thank you so much.
Where do you want it?

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:07.174
Just put her down
right here, boys.
Okeydokey.

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:10.211
Peter, since you're
going away-- do you wanna
be on our mailing list?

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:14.014
Yes, I would, ma'am.
I'd love to.
Thank you.

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:18.452
Pete, I've been trying
to get us off that mailing list
since 1982.

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:26.494
They caught her
trying to escape.

01:04:44.914 --> 01:04:49.049
That is so weird.
I know. Very strange.

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:51.886
I know.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:55.489
Hey. Hey.

01:04:55.491 --> 01:04:59.693
Sweetie? Christina,
what's going on?
What happened?

01:05:04.700 --> 01:05:08.502
You didn't want
to eat the cookies?
No, no, no, no.

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:11.972
Just read this.
All right.

01:05:11.974 --> 01:05:16.377
Thou shalt love
what's possible."

01:05:16.379 --> 01:05:20.514
- Oh, Christina, honey,
we've gone over this.
- Not that one.

01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:23.551
<i>You did not know</i>
<i> the guy was gonna be</i>
<i> getting married, all right?</i>

01:05:23.553 --> 01:05:27.288
<i>It's all right. It just</i>
<i> wasn't possible, sweetie.</i>
Not that one.

01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:36.664
- Yes. "Thou shalt not fear."
- What are you talking about,
"fear"?

01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:39.366
What you did
was an incredibly brave thing.

01:05:39.368 --> 01:05:44.104
<i>You completely</i>
<i>dropped all of your boundaries,</i>
<i> and you met this guy halfway.</i>

01:05:44.106 --> 01:05:49.343
- You met him more than halfway.
You went to somerset.
- You guys, it was another game.

01:05:49.345 --> 01:05:54.682
Come on. If he hadn't
been getting married, what
do you think I would've done?

01:05:54.684 --> 01:05:59.987
<i> Huh? That's right.</i>
<i> Court, you know.</i>

01:05:59.989 --> 01:06:04.058
I would've
done the same old thing.
I would've hesitated.

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:07.828
I would've froze up.

01:06:07.830 --> 01:06:11.432
I would've kissed him
and then ran off.

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:14.935
Give him
the wrong phone number.

01:06:14.937 --> 01:06:20.007
Hook that fish
and just throw him
right back.

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:21.976
Jesus.

01:06:26.215 --> 01:06:30.618
- I'm stuck in a rut.
- Oh, sweetie.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.989
A big, fat rut.

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:41.095
You guys, I don't
wanna be that girl anymore.

01:06:41.097 --> 01:06:43.397
I know.
You know?

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:46.433
I know.
None of us do.

01:06:49.372 --> 01:06:53.073
Let's go dancing.

01:06:53.075 --> 01:06:55.609
<i>¶ You know, it's time ¶</i>

01:06:55.611 --> 01:07:00.147
so, any chance?
Of what? No-ho.
Don't even bother.

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:04.485
She's on a mission.
<i>¶ you know, it's time ¶</i>

01:07:04.487 --> 01:07:10.357
<i>¶ to give up</i>
<i> on your mind ¶</i>

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:14.695
- <i> ¶¶</i>
- how's it shakin', ladies?

01:07:14.697 --> 01:07:17.898
No, thank you.
Your body is banging.

01:07:17.900 --> 01:07:20.868
Your face is too.
Neat-o. Thanks. Neat.

01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:25.239
<i>¶ It's time ¶</i>
<i> ¶ just come on ¶</i>

01:07:25.241 --> 01:07:29.476
<i>¶ just give in ¶</i>
what's goin' on,
hot mama?

01:07:29.478 --> 01:07:33.781
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Bringin' it down now.

01:07:33.783 --> 01:07:36.984
Bringin' it up now.
Oh, yeah.

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:40.254
Whoop, whoop!
Yeah. Here it comes, baby.

01:07:40.256 --> 01:07:45.059
Feel the monkey. Work
the monkey, monkey, monk!
The monkey, the monkey!

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:48.896
The monkey. Ooh-ooh, ah-ah.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:52.333
The monkey, the monkey.
Yeah. You
workin' that monkey.

01:07:52.335 --> 01:07:54.969
You're a good dancer.
Thanks.

01:07:54.971 --> 01:07:58.672
No. You are.
You have some original moves.
I've been workin' on 'em.

01:07:58.674 --> 01:08:02.009
Have we met before?
A couple times.

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:04.745
I'm Donny.

01:08:04.747 --> 01:08:09.850
Hi.
Christina.

01:08:09.852 --> 01:08:14.054
It feels
like<i> sixteen candles.</i>

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:17.257
I'd love
to take you out sometime.
Really?

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:23.497
Well, that's nice.
I mean, give me your card.
I'll call you sometime.

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:28.902
Thank you. You seem
like a really nice person.

01:08:28.904 --> 01:08:32.873
Yeah, work that monkey.
I'll work on the monkey.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.479
<i>¶ When you feel it</i>
<i> in your body</i>
<i> you've found somebody ¶</i>

01:08:38.481 --> 01:08:43.484

Hey.

01:09:03.973 --> 01:09:06.740
Hey, do you have a pen?
You betcha.

01:09:06.742 --> 01:09:10.744
<i>¶ You got it</i>
<i> you got it bad ¶</i>

01:09:10.746 --> 01:09:15.015
I'm a jerk,
and I wanna apologize, because
I did not plan on calling you.

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:18.052
I am gonna
give you my number
so that you can call me...

01:09:18.054 --> 01:09:21.221
Because I found out
something...

01:09:21.223 --> 01:09:27.194
That was completely
life-changing-- that it's okay
to take a chance, you know?

01:09:27.196 --> 01:09:31.165
It's okay to. Love is crazy,
and that's what love is.
It's taking a chance.

01:09:31.167 --> 01:09:36.370
And my girlfriend Courtney
and I went on this crazy ride
and went for a guy.

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:40.774
I went across the state
practically to find this guy
that I don't even know.

01:09:40.776 --> 01:09:45.412
And I don't even know you.
But here I am, I'm having
this conversation with you.

01:09:45.414 --> 01:09:50.417
And I know that if I just
take a chance-- maybe with you--
that, I don't know--

01:09:50.419 --> 01:09:56.757
forget it. Uh,
what's a guy gotta do
to get laid?

01:09:56.759 --> 01:09:59.560
<i>¶ You got it</i>
<i> you got it bad ¶</i>

01:09:59.562 --> 01:10:03.864

01:10:03.866 --> 01:10:06.567

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:11.305

01:10:22.284 --> 01:10:25.786
<i>¶¶</i>
no problem.
Okay. Here you go.

01:10:33.596 --> 01:10:36.530
Um, Chris?
Yeah?

01:10:36.532 --> 01:10:39.366
Honey?

01:10:39.368 --> 01:10:41.869
Uh--
wait. What?

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.807
Oh, my god.

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:54.681
What am I gonna do?
I think you can
handle this one on your own.

01:10:54.683 --> 01:10:58.552
It's all good, girl.
Shh.

01:10:58.554 --> 01:11:02.990
Figure this one out.
Figure it out. Okay.

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:05.959
<i> Stop.</i>

01:11:08.297 --> 01:11:10.430
Christina.

01:11:10.432 --> 01:11:13.600
What are you doing here?

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:34.788
That was all there was
to it.

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:40.093
We had fun.
We talked. That was it.

01:11:40.095 --> 01:11:41.828
Right?

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:46.300
Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:49.336
I didn't get married.

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:57.477
What do you mean?
Judy and I,
we called it off.

01:11:57.479 --> 01:11:59.513
Well,

01:11:59.515 --> 01:12:04.451
I hope that thing
that happened didn't
have anything to do with it.

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:07.554
No, no, no, no.
It had nothing to do with that.

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:10.724
Judy and I both realized
we were doing the wrong thing.

01:12:10.726 --> 01:12:13.627
I mean, two people
should be in love.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:21.368
She really liked you too.
She thought you were great.
Why were you at my wedding?

01:12:21.370 --> 01:12:23.303
You know,

01:12:23.305 --> 01:12:28.075
it was just one of those
sort of spontaneous things
my girlfriend and I do.

01:12:35.951 --> 01:12:41.855
Look, I came here tonight
'cause I wanted to see ya.

01:12:41.857 --> 01:12:46.526
And I thought that
maybe, uh--

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:51.898
well, that night
that we met, I thought
there was something,

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.234
some feeling I had
about us or--

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:58.939
I thought that maybe
you might feel that way too.

01:12:58.941 --> 01:13:02.809
Is this a mutual thing,
or am I just-- this is not
a mutual thing at all.

01:13:02.811 --> 01:13:06.880
This is a very stupid thing.
I am stupid.
I should go.
Wait, wait.

01:13:06.882 --> 01:13:12.252
I really apologize for
wasting your time, and I'm gonna
jump off the golden gate bridge.

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:15.689
Thanks. See ya.
I'm stupid.
That's right.

01:13:15.691 --> 01:13:21.261
<i> In fact, that's it--</i>
<i> exactly what I wanted</i>
<i> to-- to do.</i>

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:25.465
That's, uh-- yes, yes.
Gosh, it's going so well.

01:13:25.467 --> 01:13:27.567
<i> Yes.</i>

01:13:47.056 --> 01:13:50.390
I'm not gonna be afraid.

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.964
Peter?

01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:03.570
Shit! Peter?
Peter, wait!

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.643
Peter!

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:11.878
Peter?

01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.217
Shit.

01:14:25.561 --> 01:14:27.994
Hi.

01:14:33.936 --> 01:14:36.603
Come on! Oh!

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:39.539
Are you okay?

01:14:39.541 --> 01:14:42.409
Yes. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:45.379
Look, I don't think I really
handled that too well.
No, listen.

01:14:45.381 --> 01:14:48.715
I didn't handle it at all.
I'm so sorry.

01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:53.653
Look, I wanted to find you
so I could tell you that-- what
I couldn't tell you up there,

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:56.823
which was that I did come
to your wedding because
I wanted to see you again.

01:14:56.825 --> 01:15:00.994
Because the feeling
is mutual, and you'd better
be a really good kisser.

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:23.750
It's okay.
You can try again.

01:15:23.752 --> 01:15:25.919
Okay?

01:15:34.563 --> 01:15:37.964
You were so much better
in my dream. It's weird.
Wh--

01:15:37.966 --> 01:15:40.434
hold these.

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:46.873
I thought this was,
like, mutual.
Oh, my god.

01:15:46.875 --> 01:15:50.110
No, I'm serious.
Listen, I'll call you, okay?

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:53.079
What? Wait, wait.

01:15:53.081 --> 01:15:56.716
- Thanks for the flowers.
Really nice touch.
- I'm out of practice.

01:15:56.718 --> 01:16:00.720
I just woke up.
Unbelievable!

01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:10.797
Christina Walters.
Yep, I know her.

01:16:10.799 --> 01:16:14.601
Bitch.
Made my life a living hell.

01:16:14.603 --> 01:16:18.205
First she tries
to pawn me off on her friend.
Then she calls me a dick.

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:20.774
Then she
hunts me down like a dog
at my own wedding.

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:25.111
Then, when I try
to apologize for everything,
she's like, "I don't know you.

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:29.182
"You're one of hundreds.
I have no feelings for you.
Blah, blah, blah.

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:32.719
Wah, wah, wah.
La, la, la, la, la, la, la."

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:37.457
Is that how I sounded?
"Blah, blah, blah, blah"?

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:44.831
La, la, la,
la, la, la, la.
The movie is starting.

01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:47.834
Let's go.

01:16:57.479 --> 01:17:00.113
<i> Who loves ya?</i>
<i> Who's your daddy?</i>

01:17:13.996 --> 01:17:17.864
- Fuck grandma.
-<i> ¶ when it's over ¶</i>

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:23.603
<i>¶ that's the time</i>
<i> I fall in love again ¶</i>

01:17:26.108 --> 01:17:28.742
save yourself a buck.

01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:33.780
-<i> ¶ And when you go, go, go ¶</i>
- a girl that you lick.

01:17:33.782 --> 01:17:36.783
Really?
Yes. That you lick.
A girl that I lick?

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:40.787
- <i> ¶ I know it never ends ¶</i>

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:44.257
- ow, ow, ow.
-<i> ¶ all the things</i>
<i> that I used to say ¶</i>

01:17:44.259 --> 01:17:46.960
are you all right?

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:52.032
- Are you guys
watching the credits now?
<i>- ¶ have gone out the window ¶</i>

01:18:01.376 --> 01:18:04.077
<i>¶ All the things</i>
<i> that she used to bring ¶</i>

01:18:04.079 --> 01:18:06.746
<i>- ¶ all the songs</i>
<i> that she used to sing ¶</i>

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:20.794
¶ How do I live without-- ¶
yeah. Copy that.

01:18:26.602 --> 01:18:30.737
Is that what you want, huh?
Is that what you want?

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:38.278
-<i> ¶ I know it never ends ¶</i>
- I think there's always time
for a movie montage.

01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.382
<i>¶ It never ends ¶</i>
¶ all the things
I used to say ¶

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:44.484
<i>¶ all the words</i>
<i> that got in the way ¶</i>

01:18:44.486 --> 01:18:48.521
<i>¶ all the things</i>
<i> that I used to know</i>
<i> have gone out the window ¶</i>

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:54.761
- don't you like how sexy I am?
- - Oh!

01:18:58.033 --> 01:19:03.069
Okay! I'm not
gonna be afraid!

01:19:05.941 --> 01:19:08.141
I'm not!

01:19:09.811 --> 01:19:15.815
It's a very bad rumor.
It's a rumor.
I'm serious. Crap.

01:19:15.817 --> 01:19:17.917
<i>Action.</i>
ow.

01:19:23.125 --> 01:19:25.258
You really
got my ass there.
Sorry.

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.427
No, it's good.

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:31.598
<i> Cut.</i>

01:19:38.573 --> 01:19:40.573
I look beautiful.
You look amazing.

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:44.044
I look beautiful.
I look beautiful.
You do. Amazing.

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:49.115
<i>¶ When it's over ¶</i>
Jesus!

01:19:49.117 --> 01:19:52.552
-<i> ¶ That's the time</i>
<i> I fall in love again ¶</i>
- we can sit here all night.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:56.189
I bet you miss grandma.
Grandma!

01:19:56.191 --> 01:20:00.427
<i>¶ All the things that I used</i>
<i> to say, all the words</i>
<i> that got in the way ¶</i>

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:04.397
<i>¶ all the things</i>
<i> that I used to know</i>
<i> have gone out the window ¶</i>

01:20:06.668 --> 01:20:10.303
<i>¶ all the things she</i>
<i> used to bring, all the songs</i>
<i> that she used to sing ¶</i>

01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:15.108
<i>¶ all her favorite TV shows</i>
<i> have gone out the window ¶</i>

01:20:15.110 --> 01:20:20.213
<i>¶ all the things that</i>
<i> I used to say, all the words</i>
<i> that got in the way ¶</i>

01:20:20.215 --> 01:20:24.784
- it's Jesus. Look.
It's Jesus.
<i>- ¶ have gone out the window ¶</i>

01:20:24.786 --> 01:20:27.520
<i>¶ all the things</i>
<i> that she used to bring ¶¶</i>
so I guess...

01:20:27.522 --> 01:20:29.522
A blow job's
out of the question?

01:20:29.524 --> 01:20:32.992
- Oh, that is the sweetest thing.
- Bye!

01:20:36.698 --> 01:20:39.866
<i> Cut!</i>

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:42.235
Well, that was fun.

01:20:49.244 --> 01:20:51.478
<i>¶ Close your eyes ¶</i>

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:56.382

<i> ¶ say my name ¶</i>

01:21:20.842 --> 01:21:23.576
<i>¶ the sun shines</i>

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:39.793
<i>¶ ohh ¶</i>

01:21:39.795 --> 01:21:41.394
<i>guitar.</i>

01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.801
<i>How about the band?</i>

01:21:47.803 --> 01:21:50.804
<i>Beautiful on the bass.</i>

01:21:52.808 --> 01:21:54.808
<i>¶ Burnin' ¶</i>

01:21:57.112 --> 01:21:59.612
