00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.337
<i>Once upon a time in a
kingdom far, far away,</i>

00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:01.803
<i>the king and queen were blessed
with a beautiful baby girl.</i>

00:01:02.067 --> 00:01:05.616
<i>And throughout the land,
everyone was happy...</i>

00:01:05.864 --> 00:01:07.775
<i>until the sun went down</i>

00:01:07.949 --> 00:01:11.828
<i>and they saw that their daughter was
cursed with a frightful enchantment</i>

00:01:12.078 --> 00:01:14.990
<i>that took hold each
and every night.</i>

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:20.105
<i>Desperate, they sought the
help of a fairy godmother</i>

00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:23.168
<i>who had them lock the young
princess away in a tower,</i>

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.009
<i>there to await the kiss... of
the handsome Prince Charming.</i>

00:01:30.554 --> 00:01:33.227
<i>It was he who would chance
the perilous journey</i>

00:01:33.432 --> 00:01:35.992
<i>through blistering cold
and scorching desert</i>

00:01:36.184 --> 00:01:38.379
<i>travelling for many
days and nights,</i>

00:01:38.561 --> 00:01:40.631
<i>risking life and limb</i>

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.192
<i>to reach the Dragon's keep.</i>

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:51.169
For he was the bravest,

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:53.880
and most handsome...

00:01:56.746 --> 00:01:58.623
in all the land.

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:01.349
And it was destiny that his kiss

00:02:02.543 --> 00:02:05.694
would break the dreaded curse.

00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:11.473
He alone would climb to the
highest room of the tallest tower

00:02:11.802 --> 00:02:16.080
to enter the princess's chambers, cross
the room to her sleeping silhouette,

00:02:16.348 --> 00:02:19.340
pull back the gossamer curtains to find her...

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:21.554
What?

00:02:21.687 --> 00:02:25.123
- Princess... Fiona?
- No!

00:02:25.357 --> 00:02:28.315
Oh, thank heavens. Where is she?

00:02:28.527 --> 00:02:32.566
- She's on her honeymoon.
- Honeymoon? With whom?

00:02:46.294 --> 00:02:49.650
<i>So she said what's
the problem, baby?</i>

00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:51.553
<i>What's the problem?
I don't know.</i>

00:02:51.716 --> 00:02:53.672
<i>Well, maybe I'm in love.</i>

00:02:53.843 --> 00:02:56.152
<i>Think about it everytime
I think about it.</i>

00:02:56.346 --> 00:02:58.576
<i>Can't stop thinking about it.</i>

00:02:58.765 --> 00:03:01.757
<i>How much longer will
it take to cure this?</i>

00:03:01.976 --> 00:03:04.490
<i>Just to cure it, 'cause
I can't ignore it.</i>

00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:05.961
<i>If it's love, love.</i>

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:08.300
<i>Makes me wanna turn
around and face me.</i>

00:03:08.482 --> 00:03:10.950
<i>But I don't know
nothing about love.</i>

00:03:11.152 --> 00:03:12.870
<i>Oh, come on, come on</i>

00:03:13.029 --> 00:03:15.145
<i>Turn a little faster.</i>

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:16.756
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

00:03:16.907 --> 00:03:18.898
<i>The world will follow after.</i>

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:20.475
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:25.135
<i>Everybody's after love.</i>

00:03:29.794 --> 00:03:33.184
<i>So I said I'm a
snowball running.</i>

00:03:33.424 --> 00:03:37.053
<i>Running down into this spring
that's coming all this love.</i>

00:03:37.302 --> 00:03:40.578
<i>Melting under blue skies
belting out sunlight.</i>

00:03:40.805 --> 00:03:42.761
<i>Shimmering love.</i>

00:03:42.932 --> 00:03:44.570
<i>Well, baby, I surrender.</i>

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:46.682
<i>To the strawberry ice cream.</i>

00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:49.686
<i>Never ever end of
all this love.</i>

00:03:49.897 --> 00:03:51.728
<i>Well, I didn't mean to do it.</i>

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.097
<i>But there's no
escaping your love.</i>

00:03:55.945 --> 00:03:59.938
<i>These lines of lightning
mean we're never alone.</i>

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.508
<i>Never alone, no, no.</i>

00:04:02.702 --> 00:04:03.930
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

00:04:04.078 --> 00:04:05.955
<i>Jump a little higher.</i>

00:04:06.122 --> 00:04:07.077
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

00:04:07.206 --> 00:04:09.322
<i>If you feel a little lighter.</i>

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.649
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

00:04:10.793 --> 00:04:13.910
<i>We were once upon
a time in love.</i>

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:16.086
Hyah!

00:04:18.426 --> 00:04:21.020
<i>We're accidentally in love.</i>

00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:24.883
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>

00:04:25.557 --> 00:04:28.708
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:32.325
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>

00:04:32.564 --> 00:04:35.681
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>

00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:36.859
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.328
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.962
<i>Accidentally.</i>

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:44.265
<i>I'm in love, I'm in love,
I'm in love, I'm in love.</i>

00:04:44.492 --> 00:04:46.244
<i>I'm in love, I'm in love.</i>

00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:49.847
<i>Accidentally in love.</i>

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:53.676
<i>I'm in love.</i>

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:55.636
<i>I'm in love.</i>

00:04:55.795 --> 00:04:57.831
It's so good to be home!

00:05:00.967 --> 00:05:02.605
Just you and me and...

00:05:06.597 --> 00:05:11.034
<i>- Two can be as bad as one...
- Donkey?</i>

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:15.019
Shrek! Fiona! Aren't you
two a sight for sore eyes!

00:05:15.272 --> 00:05:17.502
Give us a hug, Shrek,
you old love machine.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.810
And look at you, Mrs. Shrek. How
about a side of sugar for the steed?

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.145
Donkey, what are you doing here?

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:26.200
Taking care of your
love nest for you.

00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:30.518
Oh, you mean like... sorting the
mail and watering the plants?

00:05:30.787 --> 00:05:33.665
- Yeah, and feeding the fish!
- I don't have any fish.

00:05:33.873 --> 00:05:36.785
You do now. I call that one
Shrek and the other Fiona.

00:05:37.002 --> 00:05:39.835
That Shrek is a rascally devil.
Get your...

00:05:40.047 --> 00:05:42.686
Look at the time. I guess
you'd better be going.

00:05:42.883 --> 00:05:46.558
Don't you want to tell me about your trip?
Or how about a game of Parcheesi?

00:05:46.803 --> 00:05:50.842
Actually, Donkey? Shouldn't you
be getting home to Dragon?

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.135
Oh, yeah, that.

00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:56.745
I don't know. She's been all
moody and stuff lately.

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:58.571
I thought I'd move in with you.

00:05:58.732 --> 00:06:01.371
You know we're always
happy to see you, Donkey.

00:06:01.568 --> 00:06:04.207
But Fiona and I are married now.

00:06:04.404 --> 00:06:07.601
We need a little time, you
know, to be together.

00:06:09.825 --> 00:06:11.861
Just with each other.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.314
Alone.

00:06:14.455 --> 00:06:17.208
Say no more. You don't have
to worry about a thing.

00:06:17.416 --> 00:06:20.010
I will always be here to make
sure nobody bothers you.

00:06:20.211 --> 00:06:21.849
- Donkey!
- Yes, roomie?

00:06:22.004 --> 00:06:23.357
You're bothering me.

00:06:24.423 --> 00:06:27.779
Oh, Okay. All right, cool.
I guess...

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.127
Me and Pinocchio was going to
catch a tournament, anyway, so...

00:06:31.346 --> 00:06:35.976
Maybe I'll see y'all Sunday
for a barbecue or something.

00:06:38.186 --> 00:06:42.179
He'll be fine. Now,
where were we?

00:06:42.441 --> 00:06:44.238
Oh.

00:06:44.401 --> 00:06:46.312
I think I remember.

00:06:48.655 --> 00:06:50.054
Donkey!

00:06:50.198 --> 00:06:53.156
I know, I know! Alone! I'm going!
I'm going.

00:06:53.368 --> 00:06:56.280
What do you want me to
tell these other guys?

00:07:06.839 --> 00:07:08.511
Enough, Reggie.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:14.116
"Dearest Princess Fiona."

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:18.339
"You are hereby summoned to
the Kingdom of Far, Far Away"

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:23.071
"for a royal ball in
celebration of your marriage"

00:07:23.356 --> 00:07:25.392
"at which time the King"

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:30.401
"will bestow his royal blessing...
upon you and your..."

00:07:30.696 --> 00:07:32.732
uh..."Prince Charming.

00:07:32.906 --> 00:07:37.343
"Love, the King and Queen
of Far, Far Away."

00:07:37.619 --> 00:07:39.974
"Aka Mom and Dad."

00:07:40.163 --> 00:07:41.437
Mom and Dad?

00:07:41.581 --> 00:07:44.778
- Prince Charming?
- Royal ball? Can I come?

00:07:45.002 --> 00:07:46.720
- We're not going.
- What?

00:07:46.878 --> 00:07:49.711
I mean, don't you think
they might be a bit...

00:07:49.923 --> 00:07:52.835
shocked to see you like this?

00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:55.360
Well, they might be a bit surprised.

00:07:55.553 --> 00:07:58.590
But they're my parents, Shrek.
They love me.

00:07:58.806 --> 00:08:01.036
And don't worry.
They'll love you, too.

00:08:01.225 --> 00:08:02.180
Yeah, right.

00:08:02.309 --> 00:08:04.903
Somehow I don't think I'll be
welcome at the country club.

00:08:05.105 --> 00:08:06.823
Stop it. They're
not like that.

00:08:06.981 --> 00:08:10.291
How do you explain Sergeant Pompous
and the Fancy Pants Club Band?

00:08:10.526 --> 00:08:13.882
Oh, come on! You could at
least give them a chance.

00:08:14.113 --> 00:08:16.024
To do what? Sharpen
their pitchforks?

00:08:16.198 --> 00:08:18.951
No! They just want to
give you their blessing.

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:23.072
Oh, great. Now I
need their blessing?

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:25.685
If you want to be a part
of this family, yes!

00:08:25.875 --> 00:08:27.831
Who says I want to be
part of this family?

00:08:28.002 --> 00:08:30.835
You did! When you married me!

00:08:31.046 --> 00:08:33.037
Well, there's some
fine print for you!

00:08:33.215 --> 00:08:36.093
So that's it. You won't come?

00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:38.815
Trust me. It's a bad idea.
We are not going!

00:08:38.816 --> 00:08:41.329
And that's final!

00:08:43.349 --> 00:08:45.943
Come on! We don't
want to hit traffic!

00:08:48.689 --> 00:08:51.408
Don't worry! We'll take care of everything.

00:08:53.234 --> 00:08:55.589
Hey, wait for me. Oof!

00:09:02.076 --> 00:09:06.467
<i>Hit it! Move 'em on! Head 'em up! Head
'em up, move 'em on! Head 'em up!</i>

00:09:06.747 --> 00:09:09.102
<i>Rawhide! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up!</i>

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:11.522
<i>Move 'em on! Move 'em on!
Head 'em up! Rawhide!</i>

00:09:11.711 --> 00:09:15.863
<i>Ride 'em up! Move 'em on! Head 'em up!
Move 'em on! Rawhide!</i>

00:09:16.132 --> 00:09:17.110
<i>Knock 'em out! Pound 'em dead!
Make 'em tea!</i>

00:09:17.111 --> 00:09:18.088
<i>Buy 'em drinks!</i>

00:09:18.259 --> 00:09:19.772
<i>Meet their mamas!
Milk 'em hard!</i>

00:09:19.927 --> 00:09:22.395
<i>Rawhide! Yee-haw!</i>

00:09:28.018 --> 00:09:30.486
- Are we there yet?
- No.

00:09:33.816 --> 00:09:36.569
- Are we there yet?
- Not yet.

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:41.929
- Okay, are we there yet?
- No.

00:09:42.866 --> 00:09:44.743
- Are we there yet?
- No!

00:09:44.909 --> 00:09:46.820
- Are we there yet?
- Yes.

00:09:46.994 --> 00:09:48.222
- Really?
- No!

00:09:48.371 --> 00:09:49.770
- Are we there yet?
- No!

00:09:49.915 --> 00:09:51.633
- Are we there yet?
- We are not!

00:09:51.792 --> 00:09:54.260
- Are we there yet?
- No!

00:09:55.754 --> 00:09:57.472
Are we there yet?

00:09:57.630 --> 00:10:01.509
That's not funny. That's really immature.

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:03.909
This is why nobody likes ogres.

00:10:04.095 --> 00:10:05.369
Your loss!

00:10:05.513 --> 00:10:08.664
- I'm gonna just stop talking.
- Finally!

00:10:08.891 --> 00:10:12.327
This is taking forever, Shrek. There's
no in-flight movie or nothing!

00:10:12.562 --> 00:10:16.237
The Kingdom of Far,
Far Away, Donkey.

00:10:16.482 --> 00:10:20.600
That's where we're going.
Far, far...

00:10:20.861 --> 00:10:22.419
Away!

00:10:22.571 --> 00:10:26.007
All right, all right, I get it.
I'm just so darn bored.

00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:28.709
Well, find a way to
entertain yourself.

00:10:51.557 --> 00:10:54.071
For five minutes...

00:10:54.269 --> 00:10:56.146
Could you not be yourself...

00:10:56.313 --> 00:10:58.702
... for five minutes!

00:11:05.821 --> 00:11:07.493
Are we there yet?

00:11:07.656 --> 00:11:10.216
- Yes!
- Oh, finally!

00:11:22.129 --> 00:11:24.085
Wow!

00:11:25.382 --> 00:11:29.580
It's going to be champagne wishes
and caviar dreams from now on.

00:11:29.845 --> 00:11:32.598
Hey, good-looking! We'll be
back to pick you up later!

00:11:32.806 --> 00:11:38.085
<i>Gotta make a move to a
town that's right for me.</i>

00:11:41.356 --> 00:11:43.870
We are definitely not
in the swamp anymore.

00:11:44.067 --> 00:11:47.139
Halt!

00:11:48.112 --> 00:11:53.186
<i>Well, I talk about it, talk about
it, talk about it, talk about it.</i>

00:11:55.286 --> 00:11:57.641
Hey, everyone, look.

00:11:57.831 --> 00:12:01.187
<i>Talk about, talk
about movin'...</i>

00:12:08.632 --> 00:12:12.511
Hey, ladies! Nice day for a parade, huh?
You working that hat.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.204
Swimming pools! Movie stars!

00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.700
Announcing the
long-awaited return

00:13:01.893 --> 00:13:06.284
of the beautiful Princess
Fiona and her new husband.

00:13:08.107 --> 00:13:09.859
Well, this is it.

00:13:10.026 --> 00:13:11.903
- This is it.
- This is it.

00:13:12.069 --> 00:13:13.297
This is it.

00:13:35.467 --> 00:13:39.346
Uh... why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll park the car.

00:13:42.558 --> 00:13:44.753
So...

00:13:44.935 --> 00:13:47.813
you still think this
was a good idea?

00:13:48.021 --> 00:13:52.253
Of course! Look. Mom and
Dad look happy to see us.

00:13:52.525 --> 00:13:56.564
- Who on earth are they?
- I think that's our little girl.

00:13:56.821 --> 00:14:00.018
That's not little! That's
a really big problem.

00:14:00.241 --> 00:14:03.392
Wasn't she supposed to kiss Prince
Charming and break the spell?

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.692
Well, he's no Prince Charming,
but they do look...

00:14:06.914 --> 00:14:10.429
Happy now? We came.
We saw them.

00:14:10.668 --> 00:14:12.943
Now let's go before
they light the torches.

00:14:13.129 --> 00:14:16.280
- They're my parents.
- Hello? They locked you in a tower.

00:14:16.507 --> 00:14:17.940
That was for my own...

00:14:18.091 --> 00:14:21.766
Good! Here's our chance. Let's go back
inside and pretend we're not home.

00:14:22.012 --> 00:14:23.206
Harold, we have to be...

00:14:23.347 --> 00:14:26.145
Quick! While they're not looking
we can make a run for it.

00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:28.261
Shrek, stop it!
Everything's gonna be...

00:14:28.435 --> 00:14:30.665
A disaster! There is no way...

00:14:30.854 --> 00:14:32.412
- You can do this.
- I really...

00:14:32.564 --> 00:14:34.953
- Really...
- Don't... want... to... be...

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:37.141
Here!

00:14:39.154 --> 00:14:42.146
Mom... Dad...

00:14:43.701 --> 00:14:45.532
I'd like you to
meet my husband...

00:14:45.702 --> 00:14:47.420
Shrek.

00:14:49.831 --> 00:14:51.583
Well, um...

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.947
It's easy to see where Fiona
gets her good looks from.

00:15:33.207 --> 00:15:35.357
Excuse me.

00:15:35.542 --> 00:15:39.091
Better out than in, I
always say, eh, Fiona?

00:15:41.548 --> 00:15:43.300
That's good.

00:15:44.175 --> 00:15:45.164
I guess not.

00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:45.717
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

00:15:45.718 --> 00:15:49.552
What do you mean, "not on the list"?
Don't tell me you don't know who I am.

00:15:49.806 --> 00:15:52.366
What's happening, everybody?
Thanks for waiting.

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:54.675
I had the hardest time
finding this place.

00:15:54.676 --> 00:15:56.791
No! No! Bad donkey! Bad! Down!

00:15:57.063 --> 00:15:59.782
No, Dad! It's all right. It's all right.
He's with us.

00:15:59.982 --> 00:16:03.292
- He helped rescue me from the dragon.
- That's me: The noble steed.

00:16:03.527 --> 00:16:05.438
Waiter! How about a
bowl for the steed?

00:16:05.613 --> 00:16:07.126
Oh, boy.

00:16:09.784 --> 00:16:11.297
- Um, Shrek?
- Yeah?

00:16:11.452 --> 00:16:14.808
Oh, sorry! Great soup, Mrs. Q.

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:16.028
Mmm!

00:16:16.165 --> 00:16:18.042
No, no. Darling.

00:16:23.046 --> 00:16:26.356
So, Fiona, tell us
about where you live.

00:16:26.591 --> 00:16:28.104
Well...

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:30.490
Shrek owns his own land.

00:16:31.263 --> 00:16:33.902
- Don't you, honey?
- Oh, yes!

00:16:34.099 --> 00:16:36.772
It's in an enchanted forest

00:16:36.977 --> 00:16:41.528
abundant in squirrels and
cute little duckies and...

00:16:41.815 --> 00:16:43.043
What?

00:16:43.191 --> 00:16:45.307
I know you ain't talking
about the swamp.

00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:49.444
An ogre from a swamp.
Oh! How original.

00:16:49.698 --> 00:16:52.496
I suppose that would be a fine
place to raise the children.

00:17:03.252 --> 00:17:05.812
It's a bit early to be
thinking about that, isn't it?

00:17:06.005 --> 00:17:08.803
- Indeed. I just started eating.
- Harold!

00:17:09.008 --> 00:17:12.045
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Dad. It's great, Okay?

00:17:12.262 --> 00:17:14.935
- For his type, yes.
- My type?

00:17:15.139 --> 00:17:16.413
I got to go to the bathroom.

00:17:16.557 --> 00:17:19.913
- Dinner is served!
- Never mind. I can hold it.

00:17:25.816 --> 00:17:26.885
<i>Bon appetit!</i>

00:17:27.025 --> 00:17:29.380
Oh, Mexican food!
My favourite.

00:17:29.569 --> 00:17:31.304
Let's not sit here with
our tummies rumbling.

00:17:31.305 --> 00:17:33.039
Everybody dig in.

00:17:33.282 --> 00:17:34.556
Don't mind if I do, Lillian.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.375
I suppose any grandchildren I
could expect from you would be...

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.850
Ogres, yes!

00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:43.872
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
Right, Harold?

00:17:44.084 --> 00:17:45.756
Oh, no! No! Of course, not!

00:17:45.919 --> 00:17:48.991
That is, assuming you
don't eat your own young!

00:17:49.213 --> 00:17:49.963
Dad!

00:17:50.089 --> 00:17:54.526
No, we usually prefer the ones
who've been locked away in a tower!

00:17:54.803 --> 00:17:58.352
- Shrek, please!
- I only did that because I love her.

00:17:58.598 --> 00:18:00.793
Aye, day care or
dragon-guarded castle.

00:18:00.975 --> 00:18:04.012
You wouldn't understand.
You're not her father!

00:18:08.816 --> 00:18:11.535
It's so nice to have the
family together for dinner.

00:18:16.032 --> 00:18:17.260
- Harold!
- Shrek!

00:18:17.408 --> 00:18:18.363
- Fiona!
- Fiona!

00:18:18.492 --> 00:18:19.641
- Mom!
- Harold...

00:18:19.785 --> 00:18:20.774
Donkey!

00:19:23.931 --> 00:19:26.923
<i>Your fallen tears
have called to me.</i>

00:19:27.976 --> 00:19:31.764
<i>So, here comes
my sweet remedy.</i>

00:19:32.939 --> 00:19:37.171
<i>I know what every
princess needs.</i>

00:19:37.443 --> 00:19:42.073
<i>For her to live
life happily...</i>

00:19:44.326 --> 00:19:48.239
Oh, my dear. Oh, look at you.

00:19:49.414 --> 00:19:51.245
You're all grown up.

00:19:51.958 --> 00:19:54.870
- Who are you?
- Oh, sweet pea!

00:19:55.086 --> 00:19:56.997
I'm your fairy godmother.

00:19:57.171 --> 00:19:59.685
- I have a fairy godmother?
- Shush, shush.

00:19:59.883 --> 00:20:04.035
Now, don't worry. I'm here
to make it all better.

00:20:04.304 --> 00:20:07.262
With just a...

00:20:08.057 --> 00:20:11.527
<i>Wave of my magic wand Your
troubles will soon be gone.</i>

00:20:11.769 --> 00:20:16.445
<i>With a flick of the wrist and just a flash
You'll land a prince with a ton of cash.</i>

00:20:16.732 --> 00:20:18.563
<i>A high-priced dress
made by mice no less.</i>

00:20:18.734 --> 00:20:20.725
<i>Some crystal glass pumps
And no more stress.</i>

00:20:20.903 --> 00:20:22.823
<i>Your worries will vanish,
your soul will cleanse.</i>

00:20:22.989 --> 00:20:24.669
<i>Confide in your very
own furniture friends.</i>

00:20:24.824 --> 00:20:27.816
<i>We'll help you set a
new fashion trend.</i>

00:20:28.035 --> 00:20:31.869
<i>- I'll make you fancy, I'll make you great.
- The kind of girl a prince would date!</i>

00:20:32.122 --> 00:20:34.317
<i>They'll write your name
on the bathroom wall...</i>

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:36.455
<i>"For a happy ever after,
give Fiona a call!"</i>

00:20:36.626 --> 00:20:40.460
<i>A sporty carriage to ride in style,
Sexy man boy chauffeur, Kyle.</i>

00:20:40.713 --> 00:20:44.149
<i>Banish your blemishes, tooth decay,
Cellulite thighs will fade away.</i>

00:20:44.384 --> 00:20:46.944
<i>And oh, what the hey!
Have a bichon frisé!</i>

00:20:47.137 --> 00:20:50.812
<i>Nip and tuck, here and there to land
that prince with the perfect hair.</i>

00:20:51.057 --> 00:20:54.333
<i>Lipstick liners, shadows blush To
get that prince with the sexy tush.</i>

00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.438
<i>Lucky day, hunk buffet You and your
prince take a roll in the hay.</i>

00:20:57.647 --> 00:21:00.764
<i>You can spoon on the moon
With the prince to the tune.</i>

00:21:00.983 --> 00:21:03.543
<i>Don't be drab, you'll be fab Your
prince will have rock-hard abs.</i>

00:21:03.695 --> 00:21:06.209
<i>Cheese soufflé, Valentine's Day
Have some chicken fricassee!</i>

00:21:06.406 --> 00:21:08.840
<i>Nip and tuck, here and there To land
that prince with the perfect hair.</i>

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:11.024
Stop!

00:21:11.202 --> 00:21:12.874
Look...

00:21:13.037 --> 00:21:15.631
Thank you very much,
Fairy Godmother,

00:21:15.831 --> 00:21:18.584
but I really don't
need all this.

00:21:21.086 --> 00:21:23.520
- Fine. Be that way.
- We didn't like you, anyway.

00:21:23.714 --> 00:21:26.672
Fiona? Fiona?

00:21:30.846 --> 00:21:33.804
Oh! You got a puppy? All I
got in my room was shampoo.

00:21:34.016 --> 00:21:35.608
Oh, uh...

00:21:35.767 --> 00:21:37.678
Fairy Godmother, furniture...

00:21:38.937 --> 00:21:41.167
I'd like you to meet
my husband, Shrek.

00:21:41.397 --> 00:21:44.833
Your husband? What? What did you say?
When did this happen?

00:21:45.069 --> 00:21:46.661
Shrek is the one who rescued me.

00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:50.574
- But that can't be right.
- Oh, great, more relatives!

00:21:50.824 --> 00:21:52.542
She's just trying to help.

00:21:52.701 --> 00:21:55.773
Good! She can help us pack. Get
your coat, dear. We're leaving.

00:21:55.995 --> 00:21:57.428
- What?
- I don't want to leave.

00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.093
When did you decide this?

00:21:59.248 --> 00:22:01.762
- Shortly after arriving.
- Look, I'm sorry...

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:05.190
No, that's all right.
I need to go, anyway.

00:22:05.422 --> 00:22:08.619
But remember, dear. If you
should ever need me...

00:22:08.883 --> 00:22:09.918
happiness...

00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:11.689
is just a teardrop away.

00:22:11.844 --> 00:22:14.278
Thanks, but we've got all
the happiness we need.

00:22:14.472 --> 00:22:16.269
Happy, happy, happy...

00:22:16.432 --> 00:22:18.502
So I see.

00:22:18.684 --> 00:22:20.481
Let's go, Kyle.

00:22:23.272 --> 00:22:24.705
- Very nice, Shrek.
- What?

00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:27.495
I told you coming
here was a bad idea.

00:22:27.693 --> 00:22:30.253
You could've at least tried
to get along with my father.

00:22:30.446 --> 00:22:32.914
I don't think I was going
to get Daddy's blessing,

00:22:33.115 --> 00:22:34.787
even if I did want it.

00:22:34.950 --> 00:22:38.829
Do you think it might be nice if
somebody asked me what I wanted?

00:22:39.079 --> 00:22:41.354
Sure. Do you want
me to pack for you?

00:22:41.539 --> 00:22:46.215
You're unbelievable!
You're behaving like a...

00:22:46.502 --> 00:22:49.380
- Go on! Say it!
- Like an ogre!

00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:50.943
Here's a news flash for you!

00:22:51.091 --> 00:22:54.800
Whether your parents like it or not...
I am an ogre!

00:23:00.767 --> 00:23:04.521
And guess what, Princess?
That's not about to change.

00:23:10.485 --> 00:23:14.398
I've made changes for you, Shrek.
Think about that.

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:20.278
That's real smooth, Shrek.
"I'm an ogre!"

00:23:46.352 --> 00:23:47.751
I knew this would happen.

00:23:47.895 --> 00:23:49.726
You should. You started it.

00:23:49.897 --> 00:23:53.731
I can hardly believe that, Lillian.
He's the ogre. Not me.

00:23:54.027 --> 00:23:57.258
I think, Harold, you're taking
this a little too personally.

00:23:57.489 --> 00:23:59.764
This is Fiona's choice.

00:23:59.949 --> 00:24:02.907
But she was supposed to choose
the prince we picked for her.

00:24:03.202 --> 00:24:07.161
I mean, you expect me to give
my blessings to this... thing?

00:24:07.414 --> 00:24:11.168
Fiona does. And she'll never
forgive you if you don't.

00:24:11.461 --> 00:24:15.852
I don't want to lose our
daughter again, Harold.

00:24:16.132 --> 00:24:18.646
Oh, you act as if love
is totally predictable.

00:24:18.843 --> 00:24:21.516
Don't you remember
when we were young?

00:24:21.762 --> 00:24:24.560
We used to walk down by
the lily pond and...

00:24:24.765 --> 00:24:27.837
- they were in bloom...
- Our first kiss.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.413
It's not the same!

00:24:29.561 --> 00:24:33.395
I don't think you realize that our
daughter has married a monster!

00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:35.844
Oh, stop being
such a drama king.

00:24:36.026 --> 00:24:37.857
Fine! Pretend there's
nothing wrong!

00:24:38.028 --> 00:24:40.906
La, di, da, di, da!
Isn't it all wonderful!

00:24:41.114 --> 00:24:43.070
I'd like to know how it
could get any worse!

00:24:43.241 --> 00:24:44.435
Hello, Harold.

00:24:44.576 --> 00:24:46.532
- What happened?
- Nothing, dear!

00:24:46.703 --> 00:24:49.536
Just the old hunting
wound playing up a bit!

00:24:50.832 --> 00:24:53.346
I'll just stretch it
out here for a while.

00:24:53.543 --> 00:24:56.535
You better get in.
We need to talk.

00:24:56.755 --> 00:24:58.791
Actually, Fairy
Godmother, off to bed.

00:24:58.965 --> 00:25:02.435
Already taken my pills, and
they tend to make me a bit drowsy.

00:25:02.677 --> 00:25:06.386
So, how about... we make
this a quick visit. What?

00:25:07.807 --> 00:25:10.401
Oh, hello. Ha-ha-ha!

00:25:12.144 --> 00:25:13.702
So, what's new?

00:25:13.854 --> 00:25:17.403
You remember my son,
Prince Charming?

00:25:17.650 --> 00:25:20.960
Is that you? My gosh!
It's been years.

00:25:21.195 --> 00:25:23.265
When did you get back?

00:25:23.447 --> 00:25:26.280
Oh, about five minutes
ago, actually.

00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:29.882
After I endured blistering
winds, scorching desert...

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.998
I climbed to the highest
room in the tallest tower...

00:25:33.206 --> 00:25:35.481
Mommy can handle this.

00:25:35.668 --> 00:25:39.627
He endures blistering winds
and scorching desert!

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.668
He climbs to the highest bloody
room of the tallest bloody tower...

00:25:43.925 --> 00:25:44.960
And what does he find?

00:25:45.093 --> 00:25:48.688
Some gender-confused wolf
telling him that his princess

00:25:48.930 --> 00:25:50.727
is already married.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:53.245
It wasn't my fault. He
didn't get there in time.

00:25:53.434 --> 00:25:55.026
Stop the car!

00:25:56.647 --> 00:25:58.239
Harold.

00:25:59.566 --> 00:26:03.844
You force me to do something
I really don't want to do.

00:26:04.112 --> 00:26:05.989
Where are we?

00:26:06.155 --> 00:26:09.033
Hi. Welcome to Friar's Fat Boy!
May I take your order?

00:26:09.241 --> 00:26:13.154
My diet is ruined! I hope you're happy.
Er... okay.

00:26:13.412 --> 00:26:16.085
Two Renaissance Wraps, no Mayo...
chili rings...

00:26:16.290 --> 00:26:19.680
- I'll have the Medieval Meal.
- One Medieval Meal and, Harold...

00:26:19.919 --> 00:26:21.830
- Curly fries?
- No, thank you.

00:26:22.004 --> 00:26:24.598
- Sourdough soft taco, then?
- No, really, I'm fine.

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:28.508
Your order, Fairy Godmother. This
comes with the Medieval Meal.

00:26:28.761 --> 00:26:29.830
There you are, dear.

00:26:33.390 --> 00:26:36.985
We made a deal, Harold, and I assume you
don't want me to go back on my part.

00:26:37.227 --> 00:26:39.343
Indeed not.

00:26:39.521 --> 00:26:42.957
So, Fiona and Charming
will be together.

00:26:43.192 --> 00:26:46.582
- Yes.
- Believe me, Harold. It's what's best.

00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.254
Not only for your daughter...

00:26:50.615 --> 00:26:52.571
but for your Kingdom.

00:26:57.246 --> 00:26:59.282
What am I supposed
to do about it?

00:27:00.917 --> 00:27:02.828
Use your imagination.

00:27:37.202 --> 00:27:38.521
Oh...

00:27:41.206 --> 00:27:43.276
Come on in, Your Majesty.

00:27:49.631 --> 00:27:52.384
<i>I like my town.</i>

00:27:54.052 --> 00:27:57.806
<i>With a little drop of poison.</i>

00:27:58.931 --> 00:28:01.399
<i>Nobody knows...</i>

00:28:02.853 --> 00:28:04.764
Excuse me.

00:28:04.938 --> 00:28:07.088
Do I know you?

00:28:07.273 --> 00:28:09.946
No, you must be mistaking
me for someone else.

00:28:10.151 --> 00:28:13.746
Uh... excuse me. I'm looking
for the Ugly Stepsister.

00:28:15.781 --> 00:28:18.215
Ah! There you are. Right.

00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:23.529
You see, I need to have
someone taken care of.

00:28:23.831 --> 00:28:27.949
- Who's the guy?
- Well, he's not a guy, per se.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:30.007
Um... He's an ogre.

00:28:32.965 --> 00:28:34.557
Hey, buddy, let me clue you in.

00:28:34.716 --> 00:28:38.834
There's only one fellow who can handle
a job like that, and, frankly...

00:28:39.095 --> 00:28:40.575
he don't like to be disturbed.

00:28:40.638 --> 00:28:41.229
He don't like to be disturbed.

00:28:41.347 --> 00:28:42.905
Where could I find him?

00:28:46.437 --> 00:28:48.393
Hello?

00:28:49.147 --> 00:28:51.422
Who dares enter my room?

00:28:51.608 --> 00:28:55.078
Sorry! I hope I'm not interrupting, but
I'm told you're the one to talk to

00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:56.958
about an ogre problem?

00:28:57.113 --> 00:28:59.308
You are told correct.

00:28:59.490 --> 00:29:03.085
But for this, I charge
a great deal of money.

00:29:03.327 --> 00:29:05.363
Would... this be enough?

00:29:12.295 --> 00:29:17.244
You have engaged my valuable
services, Your Majesty.

00:29:17.550 --> 00:29:20.747
Just tell me where I
can find this ogre.

00:29:38.862 --> 00:29:45.210
<i>Everyone says I'm
getting down too low.</i>

00:29:46.286 --> 00:29:52.156
<i>Everyone says you've
just gotta let it go.</i>

00:29:53.418 --> 00:29:56.091
<i>You just gotta let it go.</i>

00:30:05.471 --> 00:30:07.939
<i>I need some sleep.</i>

00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:11.371
<i>Time to put the
old horse down.</i>

00:30:12.854 --> 00:30:15.243
<i>I'm in too deep.</i>

00:30:15.440 --> 00:30:18.637
<i>And the wheels keep
spinning round.</i>

00:30:19.902 --> 00:30:24.262
<i>Everyone says you've
just gotta let it go.</i>

00:30:24.448 --> 00:30:26.088
<i>Everyone says you've
just gotta let it go.</i>

00:30:28.827 --> 00:30:33.582
<i>Dear Knight, I pray that you take this
favour as a token of my gratitude.</i>

00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:57.295
<i>Dear Diary...</i>

00:30:57.439 --> 00:31:00.033
<i>Sleeping Beauty is having
a slumber party tomorrow,</i>

00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:03.908
<i>but Dad says I can't go. He
never lets me out after sunset.</i>

00:31:04.946 --> 00:31:07.585
<i>Dad says I'm going
away for a while.</i>

00:31:07.782 --> 00:31:10.012
<i>Must be like some
finishing school.</i>

00:31:11.076 --> 00:31:12.873
<i>Mom says that when
I'm old enough,</i>

00:31:13.037 --> 00:31:15.676
<i>my Prince Charming will
rescue me from my tower</i>

00:31:15.873 --> 00:31:18.307
<i>and bring me back
to my family,</i>

00:31:18.501 --> 00:31:21.618
<i>and we'll all live
happily ever after.</i>

00:31:23.464 --> 00:31:25.500
<i>Mrs. Fiona Charming.</i>

00:31:27.009 --> 00:31:28.840
<i>Mrs. Fiona Charming.</i>

00:31:29.011 --> 00:31:30.364
<i>Mrs. Fiona Charming.</i>

00:31:30.512 --> 00:31:32.707
<i>Mrs. Fiona Charming.</i>

00:31:42.482 --> 00:31:45.235
Sorry. I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

00:31:45.443 --> 00:31:50.756
No, no. I was just reading a, uh...
a scary book.

00:31:51.074 --> 00:31:55.943
I was hoping you'd let me apologize
for my despicable behaviour earlier.

00:31:56.246 --> 00:31:58.601
- Okay...
- I don't know what came over me.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:02.066
Do you suppose we could pretend it
never happened and start over...

00:32:02.293 --> 00:32:05.251
- Look, Your Majesty, I just...
- Please. Call me Dad.

00:32:05.463 --> 00:32:09.422
Dad. We both acted like ogres.

00:32:09.675 --> 00:32:13.031
Maybe we just need some time
to get to know each other.

00:32:13.262 --> 00:32:17.494
Excellent idea! I was actually hoping
you might join me for a morning hunt.

00:32:17.767 --> 00:32:19.723
A little father-son time?

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.080
I know it would mean
the world to Fiona.

00:32:32.656 --> 00:32:36.854
Shall we say, 7:30
by the old oak?

00:32:42.541 --> 00:32:44.497
Face it, Donkey! We're lost.

00:32:44.751 --> 00:32:48.266
We can't be lost. We followed the
King's instructions exactly.

00:32:48.505 --> 00:32:50.780
"Head to the darkest
part of the woods..."

00:32:50.965 --> 00:32:53.877
"Past the sinister trees with
scary-looking branches."

00:32:54.093 --> 00:32:58.245
- The bush shaped like Shirley Bassey!
- We passed that three times already!

00:32:58.515 --> 00:33:01.234
You were the one who said
not to stop for directions.

00:33:01.434 --> 00:33:05.666
Oh, great. My one chance to fix
things up with Fiona's dad

00:33:05.939 --> 00:33:07.850
and I end up lost in
the woods with you!

00:33:08.024 --> 00:33:10.174
Don't get huffy! I'm
only trying to help.

00:33:10.359 --> 00:33:12.236
I know! I know.

00:33:14.738 --> 00:33:17.889
- I'm sorry, all right?
- Hey, don't worry about it.

00:33:18.117 --> 00:33:21.154
I just really need to make
things work with this guy.

00:33:21.370 --> 00:33:24.089
Yeah, sure. Now let's
go bond with Daddy.

00:33:32.214 --> 00:33:33.533
Well, well, well, Donkey.

00:33:33.673 --> 00:33:37.109
I know it was kind of a tender
moment back there, but the purring?

00:33:37.344 --> 00:33:38.936
What? I ain't purring.

00:33:39.096 --> 00:33:41.291
Sure. What's next? A hug?

00:33:41.473 --> 00:33:45.466
Hey, Shrek. Donkeys don't purr. What
do you think I am, some kind of a...

00:33:45.727 --> 00:33:48.161
Ha-ha! Fear me, if you dare!

00:33:49.689 --> 00:33:50.758
Look! A little cat.

00:33:50.899 --> 00:33:53.936
- Look out, Shrek! He got a piece!
- It's a cat, Donkey.

00:33:54.152 --> 00:33:55.983
Come here, little
kitty, kitty.

00:33:56.154 --> 00:34:01.069
Come on, little kitty. Come here.
Oh! Come here, little kitty.

00:34:04.287 --> 00:34:08.405
- Hold on, Shrek! I'm coming!
- Come on! Get it off! Get it off!

00:34:08.666 --> 00:34:10.782
Oh, God. Oh...

00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.552
No!

00:34:14.630 --> 00:34:16.905
- Look out, Shrek! Hold still!
- Get it off!

00:34:17.091 --> 00:34:19.047
Shrek! Hold still!

00:34:20.344 --> 00:34:24.053
- Did I miss?
- No. You got them.

00:34:27.643 --> 00:34:31.318
Now, ye ogre, pray
for mercy from...

00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:35.943
Puss... in Boots!

00:34:36.151 --> 00:34:37.630
I'll kill that cat!

00:34:37.777 --> 00:34:38.892
Ah-ha-ha!

00:34:56.963 --> 00:35:00.512
- Hairball.
- Oh! That is nasty!

00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:03.605
What should we do with him?

00:35:03.762 --> 00:35:06.913
Take the sword and neuter him.
Give him the Bob Barker treatment.

00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:08.368
<i>Oh, no! Por favor! Please!</i>

00:35:08.558 --> 00:35:11.152
I implore you! It was
nothing personal, Señor.

00:35:11.352 --> 00:35:12.944
I was doing it only
for my family.

00:35:13.104 --> 00:35:16.983
My mother, she is sick. And my
father lives off the garbage!

00:35:17.233 --> 00:35:20.589
The King offered me much in gold
and I have a litter of brothers...

00:35:20.819 --> 00:35:22.218
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:35:22.362 --> 00:35:25.001
Fiona's father paid
you to do this?

00:35:25.199 --> 00:35:27.119
The rich King? Sí.

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:33.958
Well, so much for
Dad's royal blessing.

00:35:34.208 --> 00:35:37.405
Don't feel bad. Almost everybody
that meets you wants to kill you.

00:35:37.627 --> 00:35:38.946
Gee, thanks.

00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.402
Maybe Fiona would've been better off if
I were some sort of Prince Charming.

00:35:46.678 --> 00:35:48.031
That's what the King said.

00:35:49.556 --> 00:35:52.673
Oh, uh... sorry. I thought that
question was directed at me.

00:35:53.894 --> 00:35:56.772
Shrek, Fiona knows you'd
do anything for her.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.972
Well, it's not like I
wouldn't change if I could.

00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:04.104
I just... I just wish I
could make her happy.

00:36:06.489 --> 00:36:07.922
Hold the phone...

00:36:09.409 --> 00:36:11.559
"Happiness."

00:36:11.744 --> 00:36:14.497
"A tear drop away."

00:36:14.705 --> 00:36:18.380
Donkey! Think of the saddest thing
that's ever happened to you!

00:36:18.626 --> 00:36:21.140
Aw, man, where do I begin?

00:36:21.337 --> 00:36:25.455
First there was the time that old farmer
tried to sell me for some magic beans.

00:36:25.716 --> 00:36:29.311
Then this fool had a party and he have
the guests trying to pin the tail on me.

00:36:29.553 --> 00:36:33.466
Then they got drunk and start beating
me with a stick, going "Piñata!"

00:36:33.724 --> 00:36:34.952
What is a piñata, anyway?

00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.455
No, Donkey! I need you to cry!

00:36:37.644 --> 00:36:38.997
Don't go projecting on me.

00:36:39.146 --> 00:36:41.137
I know you're feeling
bad, but you got to...

00:36:41.314 --> 00:36:43.350
Aaaahh!

00:36:44.192 --> 00:36:46.626
You little, hairy,
litter-licking sack of...

00:36:53.869 --> 00:36:55.825
<i>What? Is it on? Is it on?</i>

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.002
<i>This is Fairy Godmother.</i>

00:36:59.207 --> 00:37:01.277
<i>I'm either away from my
desk or with a client.</i>

00:37:01.542 --> 00:37:05.820
<i>But if you come by the office, we'll
be glad to make you an appointment.</i>

00:37:06.130 --> 00:37:07.802
<i>Have a "happy ever after."</i>

00:37:09.843 --> 00:37:11.242
Oh...

00:37:12.303 --> 00:37:14.419
Are you up for a
little quest, Donkey?

00:37:14.597 --> 00:37:17.987
That's more like it! Shrek and Donkey,
on another whirlwind adventure!

00:37:18.225 --> 00:37:21.535
<i>Ain't no stoppin' us now! Wooh!
We're on the move!</i>

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:26.207
- Stop, Ogre! I have misjudged you.
- Join the club. We've got jackets.

00:37:26.483 --> 00:37:30.158
On my honour, I am obliged to accompany
you until I have saved your life

00:37:30.404 --> 00:37:32.235
as you have spared me mine.

00:37:32.406 --> 00:37:35.557
The position of annoying talking
animal has already been taken.

00:37:35.784 --> 00:37:38.537
Let's go, Shrek. Shrek?

00:37:47.587 --> 00:37:50.704
- Shrek!
- Aw, come on, Donkey. Look at him...

00:37:50.923 --> 00:37:52.754
in his wee little boots.

00:37:52.926 --> 00:37:56.043
You know, how many cats can wear boots?
Honestly.

00:37:56.263 --> 00:37:58.936
- Let's keep him!
- Say what?

00:38:00.934 --> 00:38:02.003
Ahh!

00:38:02.143 --> 00:38:03.861
Listen. He's purring!

00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:06.978
- Oh, so now it's cute.
- Come on, Donkey. Lighten up.

00:38:07.189 --> 00:38:10.429
Lighten up? I should lighten up? Look
who's telling who to lighten up!

00:38:12.821 --> 00:38:15.415
Shrek!

00:38:20.286 --> 00:38:21.241
Shrek?

00:38:32.255 --> 00:38:34.610
They're both festive,
aren't they?

00:38:34.800 --> 00:38:36.597
What do you think, Harold?

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:38.955
Um... Yes, yes. Fine. Fine.

00:38:41.098 --> 00:38:44.568
Try to at least pretend you're interested
in your daughter's wedding ball.

00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:47.085
Honestly, Lillian, I
don't think it matters.

00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:49.500
How do we know there
will even be a ball?

00:38:49.689 --> 00:38:51.520
Mom. Dad.

00:38:51.691 --> 00:38:55.161
- Oh, hello, dear.
- What's that, Cedric? Right! Coming.

00:38:55.946 --> 00:38:57.937
Mom, have you seen Shrek?

00:38:58.115 --> 00:39:00.834
I haven't. You should
ask your father.

00:39:01.076 --> 00:39:05.467
Be sure and use small words, dear.
He's a little slow this morning.

00:39:05.747 --> 00:39:08.056
- Can I help you, Your Majesty?
- Ah, yes! Um...

00:39:09.166 --> 00:39:11.680
Mmm! Exquisite. What
do you call this dish?

00:39:11.877 --> 00:39:14.869
That would be the dog's
breakfast, Your Majesty.

00:39:15.089 --> 00:39:18.684
Ah, yes. Very good, then.
Carry on, Cedric.

00:39:18.926 --> 00:39:22.839
- Dad? Dad, have you seen Shrek?
- No, I haven't, dear.

00:39:23.097 --> 00:39:24.952
I'm sure he just went off
to look for a nice...

00:39:24.953 --> 00:39:26.806
mud hole to cool down in.

00:39:27.059 --> 00:39:29.175
You know, after your
little spat last night.

00:39:29.353 --> 00:39:31.548
Oh. You heard that, huh?

00:39:31.730 --> 00:39:33.322
The whole kingdom heard you.

00:39:33.482 --> 00:39:36.201
I mean, after all, it is
in his nature to be...

00:39:36.402 --> 00:39:37.835
well, a bit of a brute.

00:39:37.987 --> 00:39:41.980
Him? You know, you didn't exactly
roll out the Welcome Wagon.

00:39:42.241 --> 00:39:45.551
Well, what did you expect?
Look at what he's done to you.

00:39:46.411 --> 00:39:49.289
Shrek loves me for who I am.

00:39:49.497 --> 00:39:52.011
I would think you'd
be happy for me.

00:39:52.208 --> 00:39:55.439
Darling, I'm just thinking
about what's best for you.

00:39:55.670 --> 00:39:58.867
Maybe you should do the same.

00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.078
No, really?

00:40:16.231 --> 00:40:18.028
Shh...

00:40:19.819 --> 00:40:21.491
Oh...

00:40:25.157 --> 00:40:29.230
Oh, no. That's the old Keebler's place.
Let's back away slowly.

00:40:29.495 --> 00:40:31.326
That's the Fairy
Godmother's cottage.

00:40:31.497 --> 00:40:34.807
She's the largest producer of hexes
and potions in the whole kingdom.

00:40:35.042 --> 00:40:38.512
Then why don't we pop in there for a spell?
Ha-ha! Spell!

00:40:43.842 --> 00:40:45.514
He makes me laugh.

00:40:51.016 --> 00:40:53.211
Hi. I'm here to see the...

00:40:53.393 --> 00:40:56.271
The Fairy Godmother. I'm sorry.
She is not in.

00:40:56.479 --> 00:40:59.312
<i>Jerome! Coffee and a Monte Cristo.
Now!</i>

00:41:00.817 --> 00:41:03.854
Yes, Fairy Godmother.
Right away.

00:41:04.070 --> 00:41:06.743
Look, she's not seeing
any clients today, Okay?

00:41:06.948 --> 00:41:09.018
That's Okay, buddy.
We're from the union.

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:10.155
The union?

00:41:10.284 --> 00:41:14.482
We represent the workers in all magical
industries, both evil and benign.

00:41:14.747 --> 00:41:16.419
Oh! Oh, right.

00:41:16.582 --> 00:41:19.494
Are you feeling at all
degraded or oppressed?

00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:23.225
Uh... a little. We don't
even have dental.

00:41:23.464 --> 00:41:25.056
They don't even have dental.

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:27.411
Okay, we'll just
have a look around.

00:41:27.593 --> 00:41:28.742
Oh. By the way.

00:41:28.886 --> 00:41:32.037
I think it'd be better if the Fairy
Godmother didn't know we were here.

00:41:32.264 --> 00:41:35.222
- Know what I'm saying? Huh?
- Huh? Huh? Huh?

00:41:35.475 --> 00:41:38.592
- Stop it.
- Of course. Go right in.

00:42:08.174 --> 00:42:09.766
A drop of desire.

00:42:10.927 --> 00:42:12.679
Naughty!

00:42:13.971 --> 00:42:15.563
A pinch of passion.

00:42:20.811 --> 00:42:23.086
And just a hint of...

00:42:23.814 --> 00:42:24.929
lust!

00:42:28.527 --> 00:42:30.404
Excuse me.

00:42:30.571 --> 00:42:32.209
Sorry to barge in like this...

00:42:32.364 --> 00:42:35.356
What in Grimm's name
are you doing here?

00:42:35.576 --> 00:42:40.331
Well, it seems that Fiona's
not exactly happy.

00:42:40.622 --> 00:42:41.850
Oh-ho-ho!

00:42:41.998 --> 00:42:44.466
And there's some question
as to why that is?

00:42:45.461 --> 00:42:47.577
Well, let's explore
that, shall we?

00:42:49.339 --> 00:42:53.093
Ah. P, P, P. Princess.
Cinderella.

00:42:53.426 --> 00:42:56.418
Here we are. "Lived happily
ever after." Oh...

00:42:56.638 --> 00:42:58.708
No ogres!

00:42:58.890 --> 00:43:00.209
Let's see. Snow White.

00:43:00.350 --> 00:43:03.979
A handsome prince.
Oh, no ogres.

00:43:04.228 --> 00:43:06.378
Sleeping Beauty. Oh, no ogres!

00:43:06.565 --> 00:43:09.557
Hansel and Gretel? No!
Thumbelina? No.

00:43:09.776 --> 00:43:12.574
The Golden Bird, the Little
Mermaid, Pretty Woman...

00:43:12.779 --> 00:43:15.373
No, no, no, no, no!

00:43:15.573 --> 00:43:19.771
You see, ogres don't
live happily ever after.

00:43:20.035 --> 00:43:21.593
All right, look, lady!

00:43:21.745 --> 00:43:25.294
Don't you point... those
dirty green sausages at me!

00:43:26.833 --> 00:43:28.505
Your Monte Cristo and coffee.

00:43:28.669 --> 00:43:30.148
Oh! Sorry.

00:43:30.296 --> 00:43:32.252
Ah... that's okay.

00:43:32.423 --> 00:43:34.618
We were just leaving.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.360
Very sorry to have wasted
your time, Miss Godmother.

00:43:37.553 --> 00:43:39.271
Just... go.

00:43:39.429 --> 00:43:40.703
Come on, guys.

00:43:56.613 --> 00:43:58.490
TGIF, eh, buddy?

00:44:00.533 --> 00:44:03.127
Working hard or hardly
working, eh, Mac?

00:44:12.378 --> 00:44:15.848
Get your fine Corinthian footwear
and your cat cheeks out of my face!

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:17.967
Man, that stinks!

00:44:18.134 --> 00:44:21.206
You don't exactly smell
like a basket of roses.

00:44:24.223 --> 00:44:28.660
- Well, one of these has got to help.
- I was just concocting this very plan!

00:44:28.935 --> 00:44:31.893
Already our minds
are becoming one.

00:44:32.106 --> 00:44:36.782
Whoa, whoa. If we need an expert on
licking ourselves, we'll give you a call.

00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:38.627
Shrek, this is a bad idea.

00:44:38.779 --> 00:44:41.851
Look. Make yourself
useful and go keep watch.

00:44:42.074 --> 00:44:45.271
Puss, do you think you
could get to those on top?

00:44:45.493 --> 00:44:47.404
No problema, boss. In
one of my nine lives,

00:44:47.579 --> 00:44:50.332
I was the great cat burglar
of Santiago de Compostela.

00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:51.814
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:44:51.959 --> 00:44:53.233
Shrek, are you off your nut?

00:44:53.377 --> 00:44:54.935
Donkey, keep watch.

00:44:55.087 --> 00:44:56.998
Keep watch? Yeah,
I'll keep watch.

00:44:57.172 --> 00:45:01.006
I'll watch that wicked witch come and
whammy a world of hurt up your backside.

00:45:01.259 --> 00:45:04.057
I'll laugh, too. I'll
be giggling to myself.

00:45:04.262 --> 00:45:06.901
- What do you see?
- Toad Stool Softener?

00:45:07.098 --> 00:45:11.011
I'm sure a nice BM is the perfect
solution for marital problems.

00:45:11.268 --> 00:45:13.099
- Elfa Seltzer?
- Uh-uh.

00:45:13.271 --> 00:45:16.627
- Hex Lax?
- No! Try "handsome."

00:45:17.734 --> 00:45:19.087
Sorry. No handsome.

00:45:20.444 --> 00:45:23.356
Hey! How about
"Happily Ever After"?

00:45:23.572 --> 00:45:25.608
Well, what does it do?

00:45:26.408 --> 00:45:29.002
It says "Beauty Divine."

00:45:29.203 --> 00:45:32.400
In some cultures, donkeys are
revered as the wisest of creatures.

00:45:32.622 --> 00:45:34.135
Especially us talking ones.

00:45:34.292 --> 00:45:36.328
Donkey!

00:45:38.045 --> 00:45:39.876
That'll have to do.
We've got company.

00:45:47.429 --> 00:45:48.657
Can we get on with this?

00:45:52.016 --> 00:45:53.574
Hurry!

00:46:02.235 --> 00:46:03.634
Nice catch, Donkey!

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:05.697
Finally! A good use
for your mouth.

00:46:10.242 --> 00:46:11.197
Come on!

00:46:17.208 --> 00:46:19.722
<i>You spurn my natural emotions.</i>

00:46:19.919 --> 00:46:23.548
<i>You make me feel like
dirt and I'm hurt.</i>

00:46:28.135 --> 00:46:30.490
<i>And if I start a commotion.</i>

00:46:30.679 --> 00:46:34.149
<i>I run the risk of losing
you and that's worse.</i>

00:46:37.937 --> 00:46:41.486
<i>Ever fallen in love with
someone, ever fallen in love.</i>

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:44.166
<i>In love with someone,
ever fallen in love.</i>

00:46:44.359 --> 00:46:47.510
<i>In love with someone you shouldn't
have fallen in love with.</i>

00:46:54.202 --> 00:46:57.512
<i>Ever fallen in love with
someone, ever fallen in love.</i>

00:46:57.747 --> 00:47:00.341
<i>In love with someone,
ever fallen in love.</i>

00:47:00.542 --> 00:47:03.010
<i>With someone you shouldn't
have fallen in love with.</i>

00:47:04.546 --> 00:47:06.298
<i>Fallen in love with.</i>

00:47:07.590 --> 00:47:12.027
<i>Ever fallen in love with someone you
shouldn't have fallen in love with</i>

00:47:12.970 --> 00:47:17.486
I don't care whose fault it is.
Just get this place cleaned up!

00:47:17.766 --> 00:47:22.442
And somebody bring me something deep
fried and smothered in chocolate!

00:47:23.564 --> 00:47:26.920
- Mother!
- Charming. Sweetheart.

00:47:27.151 --> 00:47:30.461
This isn't a good time, pumpkin.
Mama's working.

00:47:30.696 --> 00:47:32.732
Whoa, what happened here?

00:47:32.906 --> 00:47:35.864
- The ogre, that's what!
- What? Where is he, Mom?

00:47:36.076 --> 00:47:38.465
I shall rend his head
from his shoulders!

00:47:38.662 --> 00:47:40.971
I will smite him
where he stands!

00:47:41.165 --> 00:47:44.999
He will rue the very day he
stole my kingdom from me!

00:47:45.919 --> 00:47:49.594
Oh, put it away, Junior!
You're still going to be king.

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.308
We'll just have to come up
with something smarter.

00:47:52.509 --> 00:47:54.465
Pardon. Um...

00:47:54.636 --> 00:47:58.675
Everything is accounted for, Fairy
Godmother, except for one potion.

00:47:58.931 --> 00:47:59.966
What?

00:48:01.059 --> 00:48:02.014
Oh...

00:48:02.894 --> 00:48:06.011
I do believe we can make
this work to our advantage.

00:48:07.941 --> 00:48:11.490
"Happily Ever After Potion.
Maximum strength."

00:48:11.736 --> 00:48:14.250
"For you and your true love."

00:48:14.447 --> 00:48:17.007
"If one of you drinks this,
you both will be fine."

00:48:17.199 --> 00:48:19.918
"Happiness, comfort
and beauty divine."

00:48:20.119 --> 00:48:23.668
- You both will be fine?
- I guess it means it'll affect Fiona, too.

00:48:24.874 --> 00:48:28.389
Hey, man, this don't feel right. My
donkey senses are tingling all over.

00:48:28.627 --> 00:48:31.425
Drop that jug o' voodoo and
let's get out of here.

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:34.940
It says, "Beauty Divine."
How bad can it be?

00:48:37.094 --> 00:48:40.006
See, you're allergic to that stuff.
You'll have a reaction.

00:48:40.263 --> 00:48:44.415
And if you think that I'll be smearing
Vapo Rub over your chest, think again!

00:48:44.685 --> 00:48:47.563
Boss, just in case there is
something wrong with the potion...

00:48:47.771 --> 00:48:49.602
allow me to take the first sip.

00:48:49.773 --> 00:48:53.129
It would be an honour to lay
my life on the line for you.

00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.396
Oh, no, no. I don't think so.

00:48:55.570 --> 00:48:58.038
If there'll be any animal
testing, I'll do it.

00:48:58.239 --> 00:49:01.231
That's the best friend's job.
Now give me that bottle.

00:49:06.623 --> 00:49:08.341
How do you feel?

00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:12.526
I don't feel any different.
I look any different?

00:49:12.754 --> 00:49:14.824
You still look
like an ass to me.

00:49:15.006 --> 00:49:17.918
Maybe it doesn't
work on donkeys.

00:49:18.968 --> 00:49:22.722
- Well, here's to us, Fiona.
- Shrek?

00:49:22.971 --> 00:49:26.520
- You drink that, there's no going back.
- I know.

00:49:26.768 --> 00:49:28.520
- No more wallowing in the mud?
- I know.

00:49:28.686 --> 00:49:30.324
- No more itchy butt crack?
- I know!

00:49:30.479 --> 00:49:32.754
- But you love being an ogre!
- I know!

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:38.290
But I love Fiona more.

00:49:38.362 --> 00:49:39.242
But I love Fiona more.

00:49:39.905 --> 00:49:41.702
Shrek, no! Wait!

00:49:54.544 --> 00:49:58.776
Got to be... I think you grabbed
the "Farty Ever After" potion.

00:49:59.048 --> 00:50:00.766
Maybe it's a dud.

00:50:00.925 --> 00:50:01.425
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

00:50:01.426 --> 00:50:03.815
Or maybe Fiona and I
were never meant to be.

00:50:07.641 --> 00:50:11.077
Uh-oh. What did I tell you?
I feel something coming on.

00:50:11.311 --> 00:50:14.462
I don't want to die. I don't want to die.
I don't want to die!

00:50:14.689 --> 00:50:17.886
Oh, sweet sister, mother of mercy.
I'm melting!

00:50:18.109 --> 00:50:20.100
I'm melting!

00:50:20.277 --> 00:50:22.108
It's just the rain, Donkey.

00:50:23.155 --> 00:50:25.510
Oh.

00:51:07.198 --> 00:51:09.996
Don't worry. Things seem bad
because it's dark and rainy

00:51:10.202 --> 00:51:12.670
and Fiona's father hired a
sleazy hitman to whack you.

00:51:13.913 --> 00:51:16.825
It'll be better in the morning.
You'll see...

00:51:17.083 --> 00:51:19.995
<i>The sun'll come out...</i>

00:51:20.211 --> 00:51:21.929
<i>Tomorrow</i>

00:51:23.130 --> 00:51:24.768
<i>Bet your bottom...</i>

00:51:24.924 --> 00:51:26.642
Bet my bottom?

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:28.028
I'm coming, Elizabeth!

00:51:28.177 --> 00:51:29.769
Donkey?

00:51:29.928 --> 00:51:31.759
Are you all right?

00:51:31.931 --> 00:51:35.606
- Hey, boss. Let's shave him.
- D-Donkey?

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.510
There you are! We
missed you at dinner.

00:51:48.988 --> 00:51:50.421
What is it, darling?

00:51:50.573 --> 00:51:52.086
Dad...

00:51:52.242 --> 00:51:54.472
I've been thinking
about what you said.

00:51:55.537 --> 00:51:57.368
And I'm going to
set things right.

00:51:57.581 --> 00:51:59.970
Ah! Excellent! That's my girl.

00:52:00.166 --> 00:52:02.760
It was a mistake to
bring Shrek here.

00:52:02.961 --> 00:52:05.600
I'm going to go
out and find him.

00:52:05.797 --> 00:52:08.755
And then we'll go back to
the swamp where we belong.

00:52:12.094 --> 00:52:13.812
Fiona, please!

00:52:13.972 --> 00:52:16.805
Let's not be rash, darling. You
can't go anywhere right now.

00:52:19.852 --> 00:52:21.001
Fiona!

00:53:00.892 --> 00:53:05.647
Look, I told you he was here. Look at him!
Quiet. Look at him.

00:53:08.232 --> 00:53:09.711
Good morning, sleepyhead.

00:53:10.943 --> 00:53:12.376
Good morning!

00:53:12.528 --> 00:53:14.041
We love your kitty!

00:53:14.196 --> 00:53:17.745
- Oh... My head...
- Here, I fetched a pail of water.

00:53:17.992 --> 00:53:19.471
Thanks.

00:53:19.619 --> 00:53:20.574
Uhh!

00:53:23.122 --> 00:53:24.635
Aahh!

00:53:24.790 --> 00:53:25.745
Oh...

00:53:27.585 --> 00:53:30.099
A cute button nose?

00:53:30.295 --> 00:53:32.251
Thick, wavy locks?

00:53:33.257 --> 00:53:35.213
Taut, round buttocks?

00:53:36.092 --> 00:53:37.525
I'm... I'm...

00:53:37.678 --> 00:53:38.997
- Gorgeous!
- I'll say.

00:53:39.138 --> 00:53:40.730
I'm Jill. What's your name?

00:53:40.890 --> 00:53:44.883
- Um... Shrek.
- Shrek? Wow. Are you from Europe?

00:53:45.144 --> 00:53:47.339
- You're tense.
- I want to rub his shoulders.

00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:50.194
- I got it covered.
- I don't have anything to rub.

00:53:50.398 --> 00:53:51.106
Get in line.

00:53:51.107 --> 00:53:51.903
Get in line.

00:53:52.025 --> 00:53:54.823
- Have you seen my donkey?
- Who are you calling donkey?

00:53:56.154 --> 00:53:59.703
- Donkey? You're a...
- A stallion, baby!

00:54:00.033 --> 00:54:00.943
I can whinny.

00:54:01.076 --> 00:54:03.112
I can count.

00:54:03.537 --> 00:54:06.370
Look at me, Shrek!
I'm trotting!

00:54:07.081 --> 00:54:10.073
That's some quality potion.
What's in that stuff?

00:54:10.293 --> 00:54:13.365
"Oh, don't take the potion,
Mr. Boss, it's very bad."

00:54:13.587 --> 00:54:14.622
Pah!

00:54:14.755 --> 00:54:19.112
"Warning: Side effects may include
burning, itching, oozing, weeping."

00:54:19.386 --> 00:54:21.081
"Not intended for heart
patients or those with...

00:54:21.082 --> 00:54:22.776
nervous disorders."

00:54:23.014 --> 00:54:26.006
I'm trotting, I'm trotting in place!
Yeah!

00:54:28.227 --> 00:54:29.216
What?

00:54:29.353 --> 00:54:32.902
Señor? "To make the effects
of this potion permanent",

00:54:33.148 --> 00:54:36.584
"the drinker must obtain his
true love's kiss by midnight."

00:54:36.818 --> 00:54:39.013
Midnight? Why is it
always midnight?

00:54:39.196 --> 00:54:41.915
- Pick me! I'll be your true love!
- I'll be your true love.

00:54:42.116 --> 00:54:44.550
I'll be true... enough.

00:54:44.785 --> 00:54:47.982
Look, ladies, I already
have a true love.

00:54:48.205 --> 00:54:49.274
Oh...

00:54:49.414 --> 00:54:50.813
And take it from me, Boss.

00:54:50.957 --> 00:54:53.949
You are going to have
one satisfied princess.

00:54:54.169 --> 00:54:56.729
And let's face it. You are
a lot easier on the eyes.

00:54:56.921 --> 00:54:59.230
Inside you're the same
old mean, salty...

00:54:59.424 --> 00:55:01.335
- Easy.
- Cantankerous, foul,

00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:03.228
angry ogre you always been.

00:55:03.387 --> 00:55:05.457
And you're still the
same annoying donkey.

00:55:05.639 --> 00:55:08.107
Yeah.

00:55:08.308 --> 00:55:09.787
Well...

00:55:10.476 --> 00:55:14.185
Look out, Princess.
Here comes the new me.

00:55:15.022 --> 00:55:16.341
First things first.

00:55:16.482 --> 00:55:18.916
We need to get you out of those clothes.

00:55:22.739 --> 00:55:24.252
- Ready?
- Ready!

00:55:28.202 --> 00:55:30.193
Driver, stop!

00:55:30.371 --> 00:55:33.363
Oh, God! Help me, please!
My racing days are over!

00:55:33.582 --> 00:55:35.220
I'm blind! Tell the truth.

00:55:35.375 --> 00:55:37.013
Will I ever play
the violin again?

00:55:37.169 --> 00:55:38.807
You poor creature!

00:55:38.962 --> 00:55:41.078
Is there anything
I can do for you?

00:55:41.256 --> 00:55:43.406
Well, I guess there
is one thing.

00:55:43.592 --> 00:55:46.470
Take off the powdered wig and
step away from your drawers.

00:55:50.599 --> 00:55:52.829
- Not bad.
- Not bad at all.

00:56:00.858 --> 00:56:04.009
Father? Is everything
all right, Father?

00:56:09.451 --> 00:56:13.205
Thank you, gentlemen!
Someday, I will repay you.

00:56:13.454 --> 00:56:16.810
Unless, of course, I can't
find you or if I forget.

00:56:24.173 --> 00:56:26.243
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

00:56:34.016 --> 00:56:37.770
<i>Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes Turn
and face the strange.</i>

00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:40.056
<i>Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.949
<i>Don't wanna be a richer one.</i>

00:56:43.149 --> 00:56:44.821
<i>Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>

00:56:44.984 --> 00:56:47.452
<i>Turn and face the strange.</i>

00:56:47.655 --> 00:56:49.486
<i>Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>

00:56:49.656 --> 00:56:52.489
<i>Just gonna have to
be a different man.</i>

00:56:52.701 --> 00:56:55.090
<i>Time may change me.</i>

00:56:55.287 --> 00:56:58.279
<i>But I can't trace time.</i>

00:57:00.750 --> 00:57:01.626
Halt!

00:57:01.751 --> 00:57:05.141
Tell Princess Fiona her husband,
Sir Shrek, is here to see her.

00:57:09.885 --> 00:57:13.036
<i>Still don't know what
I was looking for.</i>

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:18.576
<i>And my time was running wild,
a million dead-end streets.</i>

00:57:18.893 --> 00:57:21.851
<i>Every time I thought
I'd got it made.</i>

00:57:22.062 --> 00:57:24.530
<i>It seemed the taste
was not so sweet</i>

00:57:24.732 --> 00:57:26.688
<i>Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>

00:57:26.859 --> 00:57:28.372
<i>Turn and face the strange.</i>

00:57:28.528 --> 00:57:30.962
<i>- Shrek?
- Ch-Ch-Changes.</i>

00:57:31.155 --> 00:57:33.794
<i>Don't wanna be a richer one.</i>

00:57:33.991 --> 00:57:36.630
<i>Time may change me.</i>

00:57:36.827 --> 00:57:39.341
<i>But I can't trace time</i>

00:57:39.538 --> 00:57:40.493
Fiona?

00:57:43.834 --> 00:57:45.711
Hello, handsome.

00:57:47.629 --> 00:57:48.903
Shrek!

00:57:49.088 --> 00:57:52.239
- Princess!
- Donkey?

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:54.504
Wow! That potion
worked on you, too?

00:57:54.678 --> 00:57:55.906
What potion?

00:57:56.054 --> 00:57:59.091
Shrek and I took some magic potion.
And well...

00:57:59.307 --> 00:58:01.423
Now, we're sexy!

00:58:02.810 --> 00:58:03.845
Shrek?

00:58:08.149 --> 00:58:10.663
For you, baby... I could be.

00:58:10.861 --> 00:58:13.056
- Yeah, you wish.
- Donkey, where is Shrek?

00:58:13.238 --> 00:58:15.468
He went inside looking for you.

00:58:17.450 --> 00:58:19.202
Shrek?

00:58:19.368 --> 00:58:21.882
Fiona! Fiona!

00:58:23.914 --> 00:58:25.984
You want to dance, pretty boy?

00:58:28.877 --> 00:58:32.426
Are you going so soon? Don't
you want to see your wife?

00:58:33.966 --> 00:58:34.876
Fiona?

00:58:37.428 --> 00:58:38.543
Shrek?

00:58:38.679 --> 00:58:41.352
Aye, Fiona. It is me.

00:58:41.557 --> 00:58:43.195
What happened to your voice?

00:58:43.350 --> 00:58:47.309
The potion changed a
lot of things, Fiona.

00:58:47.562 --> 00:58:50.030
But not the way I
feel about you.

00:58:50.231 --> 00:58:51.664
Fiona?

00:58:52.610 --> 00:58:55.363
- Charming?
- Do you think so?

00:58:55.571 --> 00:58:59.200
Dad. I was so hoping you'd approve.

00:58:59.449 --> 00:59:02.919
- Um... Who are you?
- Mom, it's me, Shrek.

00:59:03.161 --> 00:59:06.471
I know you never get a second
chance at a first impression,

00:59:06.748 --> 00:59:09.057
but, well, what do you think?

00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:16.014
Fiona! Fiona!

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:19.358
Fiona!

00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:23.298
- Fiona!
- Fiona, Fiona! Ho-ho-ho!

00:59:23.556 --> 00:59:26.992
Oh, shoot! I don't think
they can hear us, pigeon.

00:59:29.728 --> 00:59:32.959
Don't you think you've already
messed her life up enough?

00:59:33.982 --> 00:59:35.938
I just wanted her to be happy.

00:59:36.110 --> 00:59:38.340
And now she can be.

00:59:38.529 --> 00:59:40.440
Oh, sweetheart.

00:59:40.614 --> 00:59:44.289
She's finally found the
prince of her dreams.

00:59:44.535 --> 00:59:48.448
But look at me. Look
what I've done for her.

00:59:48.705 --> 00:59:51.822
It's time you stop living
in a fairy tale, Shrek.

00:59:52.041 --> 00:59:56.034
She's a princess,
and you're an ogre.

00:59:56.296 --> 01:00:00.175
That's something no amount
of potion will ever change.

01:00:07.682 --> 01:00:09.479
But...

01:00:09.642 --> 01:00:11.075
I love her.

01:00:11.227 --> 01:00:13.946
If you really love her...

01:00:14.146 --> 01:00:16.102
you'll let her go.

01:00:21.112 --> 01:00:22.067
Shrek?

01:00:22.196 --> 01:00:23.231
Señor.

01:00:23.364 --> 01:00:26.242
What's going on?
Where are you going?

01:00:32.623 --> 01:00:36.821
You wouldn't have had anything to
do with this, would you, Harold?

01:00:42.216 --> 01:00:45.174
<i>People just ain't no good.</i>

01:00:48.096 --> 01:00:51.293
<i>I think that's
well understood.</i>

01:00:51.516 --> 01:00:53.108
There you go, boys.

01:00:53.268 --> 01:00:55.145
Just leave the bottle, Doris.

01:00:55.311 --> 01:00:57.620
Hey. Why the long face?

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:01.203
It was all just a
stupid mistake.

01:01:02.235 --> 01:01:05.910
I never should have rescued her
from that tower in the first place.

01:01:08.283 --> 01:01:10.114
I hate Mondays.

01:01:10.285 --> 01:01:13.755
I can't believe you'd walk away from
the best thing that happened to you.

01:01:13.996 --> 01:01:15.509
What choice do I have?

01:01:15.664 --> 01:01:18.974
She loves that pretty
boy, Prince Charming.

01:01:19.209 --> 01:01:21.200
Come on. Is he really
that good-looking?

01:01:21.379 --> 01:01:23.734
Are you kidding?
He's gorgeous!

01:01:23.923 --> 01:01:26.995
He has a face that looks like
it was carved by angels.

01:01:27.218 --> 01:01:29.686
- Oh. He sounds dreamy.
- You know...

01:01:29.887 --> 01:01:33.084
shockingly, this isn't
making me feel any better.

01:01:36.018 --> 01:01:39.806
Look, guys. It's for the best.

01:01:40.063 --> 01:01:41.416
Mom and Dad approve,

01:01:41.565 --> 01:01:44.762
and Fiona gets the man
she's always dreamed of.

01:01:44.985 --> 01:01:46.782
Everybody wins.

01:01:47.863 --> 01:01:49.091
Except for you.

01:01:49.239 --> 01:01:52.390
I don't get it, Shrek.
You love Fiona.

01:01:52.617 --> 01:01:53.891
Aye.

01:01:54.953 --> 01:01:57.421
And that's why I
have to let her go.

01:01:58.331 --> 01:02:01.289
Excuse me, is she here?

01:02:01.501 --> 01:02:03.537
She's, uh... in the back.

01:02:04.921 --> 01:02:06.639
Oh, hello again.

01:02:10.969 --> 01:02:13.005
Fairy Godmother. Charming.

01:02:13.179 --> 01:02:17.297
You'd better have a good reason for
dragging us down here, Harold.

01:02:17.558 --> 01:02:23.110
Well, I'm afraid Fiona isn't really...
warming up to Prince Charming.

01:02:23.439 --> 01:02:26.795
- FYI, not my fault.
- No, of course it's not, dear.

01:02:27.068 --> 01:02:28.786
I mean, how charming can I be

01:02:28.945 --> 01:02:31.254
when I have to pretend
I'm that dreadful ogre?

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.403
No, no, it's nobody's fault.

01:02:33.574 --> 01:02:36.725
Perhaps it's best if we just
call the whole thing off, okay?

01:02:36.952 --> 01:02:41.150
- What?
- You can't force someone to fall in love!

01:02:41.414 --> 01:02:44.451
I beg to differ. I
do it all the time!

01:02:44.668 --> 01:02:48.946
Have Fiona drink this and she'll fall
in love with the first man she kisses,

01:02:49.214 --> 01:02:51.091
which will be Charming.

01:02:52.259 --> 01:02:55.137
- Umm... no.
- What did you say?

01:02:55.345 --> 01:02:57.620
I can't. I won't do it.

01:02:57.806 --> 01:02:59.319
Oh, yes, you will.

01:02:59.474 --> 01:03:02.910
If you remember, I helped you
with your happily ever after.

01:03:03.144 --> 01:03:06.534
And I can take it
away just as easily.

01:03:06.773 --> 01:03:09.845
Is that what you want? Is it?

01:03:10.944 --> 01:03:13.378
- No.
- Good boy.

01:03:13.571 --> 01:03:15.209
Now, we have to go.

01:03:15.365 --> 01:03:17.515
I need to do Charming's
hair before the ball.

01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.816
He's hopeless. He's all
high in the front.

01:03:19.994 --> 01:03:22.713
He can never get to the back. You
need someone to do the back.

01:03:22.913 --> 01:03:24.471
Oh. Thank you, Mother.

01:03:24.623 --> 01:03:26.375
Mother?

01:03:26.543 --> 01:03:29.580
Um... Mary! A talking horse!

01:03:29.796 --> 01:03:30.831
The ogre!

01:03:32.673 --> 01:03:36.507
Stop them! Thieves! Bandits!
Stop them!

01:03:38.303 --> 01:03:41.181
<i>The abs are fab and it's gluteus
to the maximus</i>

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:44.621
<i>here at tonight's Far, Far
Away Royal Ball blowout!</i>

01:03:44.851 --> 01:03:47.763
<i>The coaches are lined up as the
cream of the crop pours out of them</i>

01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:49.698
<i>like Miss Muffet's
curds and whey.</i>

01:03:49.857 --> 01:03:51.734
Everyone who's anyone
has turned out

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.289
to honour Princess Fiona
and Prince Shrek.

01:03:54.486 --> 01:03:57.398
And, oh my, the outfits
look gorgeous!

01:03:57.614 --> 01:03:58.888
Look! Hansel and Gretel!

01:03:59.866 --> 01:04:01.538
What the heck are
the crumbs for?

01:04:01.701 --> 01:04:04.613
And right behind them, Tom
Thumb and Thumbelina!

01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:07.389
Oh, aren't they adorable!

01:04:07.581 --> 01:04:10.573
Here comes Sleeping Beauty!

01:04:10.794 --> 01:04:12.625
Tired old thing.

01:04:13.505 --> 01:04:16.224
Who's this? Who's this?
Who is this?

01:04:16.424 --> 01:04:19.461
Oh. It's the one,
it's the only...

01:04:19.677 --> 01:04:22.145
It's the Fairy Godmother!

01:04:22.346 --> 01:04:25.463
Hello, Far, Far Away!

01:04:26.809 --> 01:04:28.845
Can I get a whoop whoop?

01:04:30.229 --> 01:04:33.505
May all your endings
be happy and...

01:04:33.733 --> 01:04:36.645
Well, you know the rest!

01:04:36.861 --> 01:04:39.739
<i>We'll be right back with the
Royal Far, Far Away Ball</i>

01:04:39.947 --> 01:04:41.778
<i>after these messages.</i>

01:04:41.949 --> 01:04:43.541
I hate these ball shows.

01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:46.658
They bore me to tears. Flip
over to Wheel Of Torture!

01:04:46.870 --> 01:04:50.306
I'm not flipping anywhere, sir,
until I see Shrek and Fiona.

01:04:50.541 --> 01:04:53.135
Whizzes on you guys.

01:04:53.335 --> 01:04:55.326
Hey, mice, pass me
a buffalo wing!

01:04:55.504 --> 01:04:57.654
No, to your left. Your left!

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.837
<i>- Tonight on "Knights"...
- Now here's a good show!</i>

01:05:04.053 --> 01:05:07.329
<i>We got a white bronco heading east
into the forest. Requesting backup.</i>

01:05:07.557 --> 01:05:09.548
<i>It's time to teach
these madcap mammals</i>

01:05:09.725 --> 01:05:12.364
<i>their "devil may mare"
attitudes just won't fly.</i>

01:05:13.897 --> 01:05:17.446
Why you grabbing me?
Police brutality!

01:05:18.776 --> 01:05:20.732
I have to talk to
Princess Fiona!

01:05:20.903 --> 01:05:22.859
- We warned you!
- Ow! Ow!

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:25.385
<i>Did someone let the
cat out of the bag?</i>

01:05:25.574 --> 01:05:27.451
You capitalist pig dogs!

01:05:33.082 --> 01:05:34.674
- Catnip!
- That's not mine.

01:05:35.835 --> 01:05:37.826
Find Princess Fiona!

01:05:38.003 --> 01:05:39.595
I'm a donkey!

01:05:39.755 --> 01:05:42.315
Tell her Shrek... I'm
her husband, Shrek!

01:05:43.592 --> 01:05:44.991
Quick! Rewind it!

01:05:46.094 --> 01:05:48.449
I'm her husband, Shrek! Ow!

01:06:16.416 --> 01:06:17.405
Darling?

01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:20.337
Ah. I thought I might
find you here.

01:06:20.503 --> 01:06:23.973
How about a nice hot cup
of tea before the ball?

01:06:25.341 --> 01:06:26.615
I'm not going.

01:06:26.759 --> 01:06:29.671
The whole Kingdom's turned out
to celebrate your marriage.

01:06:29.887 --> 01:06:33.675
There's just one problem.
That's not my husband.

01:06:34.975 --> 01:06:36.613
I mean, look at him.

01:06:38.979 --> 01:06:40.412
Yes, he is a bit different,

01:06:40.564 --> 01:06:43.476
but people change for
the ones they love.

01:06:43.692 --> 01:06:46.764
You'd be surprised how much
I changed for your mother.

01:06:46.987 --> 01:06:48.659
Change?

01:06:48.822 --> 01:06:50.938
He's completely lost his mind!

01:06:51.116 --> 01:06:54.472
Why not come down to the ball
and give him another chance?

01:06:54.702 --> 01:06:57.500
You might find you
like this new Shrek.

01:06:57.706 --> 01:07:00.823
But it's the old one I
fell in love with, Dad.

01:07:02.002 --> 01:07:04.038
I'd give anything
to have him back.

01:07:07.298 --> 01:07:10.256
Darling. That's mine. Decaf.

01:07:10.468 --> 01:07:12.299
Otherwise I'm up all night.

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:20.868
Thanks.

01:07:23.481 --> 01:07:24.834
I got to get out of here!

01:07:24.982 --> 01:07:27.496
You can't lock us up like this!
Let me go!

01:07:27.693 --> 01:07:29.126
What about my Miranda rights?

01:07:29.278 --> 01:07:31.917
You're supposed to say I have
the right to remain silent.

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.230
Nobody said I have the
right to remain silent!

01:07:34.408 --> 01:07:36.876
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:07:37.119 --> 01:07:39.553
What you lack is the capacity.

01:07:39.747 --> 01:07:43.103
I must hold on before
I, too, go totally mad.

01:07:43.334 --> 01:07:45.529
Shrek? Donkey?

01:07:46.628 --> 01:07:48.027
Too late.

01:07:48.213 --> 01:07:51.285
Gingy! Pinocchio!
Get us out of here!

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:52.699
Oh...

01:07:57.013 --> 01:07:58.765
Fire in ze hole!

01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:18.928
Look out below!

01:08:21.454 --> 01:08:23.365
Quick! Tell a lie!

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:26.134
- What should I say?
- Anything, but quick!

01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:29.208
Say something crazy like "I'm
wearing ladies' underwear!"

01:08:29.420 --> 01:08:31.456
I am wearing ladies' underwear.

01:08:35.384 --> 01:08:37.898
- Are you?
- I most certainly am not!

01:08:38.970 --> 01:08:41.165
It looks like you most
certainly am are!

01:08:41.349 --> 01:08:42.862
- I am not!
- What kind?

01:08:43.017 --> 01:08:45.485
- It's a thong!
- Oww! They're briefs!

01:08:45.769 --> 01:08:46.997
- Are not.
- Are too!

01:08:47.146 --> 01:08:48.784
- Are not!
- Are too!

01:08:48.939 --> 01:08:50.611
Here we go. Hang tight.

01:08:54.152 --> 01:08:57.030
Wait, wait, wait!
Ow! Ow! Hey, hey, hey!

01:08:57.781 --> 01:08:58.770
Ow!

01:09:01.159 --> 01:09:03.389
- Excuse me?
- What? Puss!

01:09:03.579 --> 01:09:05.615
Pardon me, would you
mind letting me go?

01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:07.620
- Sorry, boss.
- Quit messing around!

01:09:07.791 --> 01:09:09.543
We've got to stop that kiss!

01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:11.461
I thought you was
going to let her go.

01:09:11.628 --> 01:09:13.823
I was, but I can't let
them do this to Fiona.

01:09:14.005 --> 01:09:17.077
Boom! That's what I like to hear.
Look who's coming around!

01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:18.972
It's impossible!
We'll never get in.

01:09:19.135 --> 01:09:22.047
The castle's guarded. There's
a moat and everything!

01:09:22.262 --> 01:09:27.859
Folks, it looks like we're up chocolate
creek without a Popsicle stick.

01:09:32.398 --> 01:09:36.027
- What?
- Do you still know the Muffin Man?

01:09:36.276 --> 01:09:39.586
Well, sure! He's down
on Drury Lane. Why?

01:09:39.821 --> 01:09:42.176
Because we're gonna need flour.

01:09:42.365 --> 01:09:45.277
Lots and lots of flour.

01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:50.060
Gingy!

01:09:50.249 --> 01:09:54.481
Fire up the ovens, Muffin Man!
We've got a big order to fill!

01:09:58.673 --> 01:10:00.550
It's alive!

01:10:08.809 --> 01:10:12.518
Run, run, run, as fast you can!

01:10:19.860 --> 01:10:21.896
Go, baby, go!

01:10:23.489 --> 01:10:26.322
There it is, Mongo!
To the castle!

01:10:26.534 --> 01:10:30.732
No, you great stupid pastry!
Come on!

01:10:38.712 --> 01:10:41.306
Mongo! Down here!
Look at the pony!

01:10:43.008 --> 01:10:45.283
That's right! Follow
the pretty pony!

01:10:45.510 --> 01:10:47.865
Pretty pony wants to
play at the castle!

01:10:48.055 --> 01:10:49.647
Pretty pony.

01:10:51.392 --> 01:10:53.223
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:10:53.393 --> 01:10:57.944
Presenting Princess Fiona and
her new husband, Prince Shrek.

01:11:00.608 --> 01:11:02.644
Shrek, what are you doing?

01:11:02.819 --> 01:11:05.936
I'm just playing
the part, Fiona.

01:11:06.155 --> 01:11:07.952
Is that glitter on your lips?

01:11:08.115 --> 01:11:10.913
Mm. Cherry flavoured.
Want to taste?

01:11:11.119 --> 01:11:14.794
- Ugh! What is with you?
- But, Muffin Cake...

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:20.025
C Minor, put it in C Minor.

01:11:21.212 --> 01:11:22.611
Ladies and gentlemen.

01:11:25.257 --> 01:11:28.055
I'd like to dedicate
this song to...

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.570
Princess Fiona and Prince Shrek.

01:11:32.765 --> 01:11:34.403
Fiona, my Princess.

01:11:34.559 --> 01:11:37.027
Will you honour me with a dance?

01:11:37.686 --> 01:11:42.043
<i>Where have all the
good men gone.</i>

01:11:42.316 --> 01:11:45.035
<i>And where are all the gods?</i>

01:11:45.235 --> 01:11:46.304
Dance!

01:11:46.444 --> 01:11:50.039
<i>Where's the
streetwise Hercules.</i>

01:11:50.323 --> 01:11:53.759
<i>To fight the rising odds?</i>

01:11:57.164 --> 01:11:58.483
Since when do you dance?

01:11:58.623 --> 01:12:01.376
Fiona, my dearest, if
there's one thing I know,

01:12:01.584 --> 01:12:04.735
it's that love is
full of surprises.

01:12:04.963 --> 01:12:07.397
<i>Late at night I
toss and I turn.</i>

01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:11.947
<i>And I dream of what I need.</i>

01:12:14.806 --> 01:12:16.319
Hit it!

01:12:19.102 --> 01:12:20.660
<i>I need a hero.</i>

01:12:20.812 --> 01:12:24.725
All right, big fella!
Let's crash this party!

01:12:26.317 --> 01:12:27.989
Man the catapults!

01:12:28.652 --> 01:12:30.768
Aim! Fire!

01:12:31.989 --> 01:12:35.026
- Brace yourselves!
- Ooh! Purty!

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.653
Not the gumdrop button!

01:12:51.132 --> 01:12:53.885
Incoming!

01:12:54.094 --> 01:12:55.573
Ha-ha! All right!

01:12:58.599 --> 01:13:04.071
<i>Somewhere after midnight
In my wildest fantasy.</i>

01:13:04.396 --> 01:13:05.988
Go, Mongo! Go!

01:13:09.692 --> 01:13:11.842
Man the cauldrons!

01:13:16.741 --> 01:13:18.697
After you, Mongo.

01:13:21.454 --> 01:13:25.572
- That's it! Heave-ho!
- Watch out!

01:13:28.544 --> 01:13:29.772
Shrek!

01:13:33.715 --> 01:13:35.433
More heat, less foam!

01:13:35.592 --> 01:13:38.265
<i>Up where the mountains
Meet the heavens above.</i>

01:13:38.471 --> 01:13:41.304
<i>Out where the lightning
Splits the sea.</i>

01:13:41.515 --> 01:13:46.145
<i>I could swear there is someone
Somewhere watching me.</i>

01:13:46.436 --> 01:13:48.996
Heave! Ho!

01:14:27.184 --> 01:14:28.617
Come on!

01:14:29.979 --> 01:14:31.048
Look out!

01:14:31.188 --> 01:14:34.737
Be good.

01:14:36.235 --> 01:14:38.624
He needs me! Let me go!

01:14:42.158 --> 01:14:43.716
Donkey!

01:14:53.043 --> 01:14:54.442
Puss!

01:14:57.547 --> 01:14:59.902
Go! Go! Your lady needs you! Go!

01:15:02.761 --> 01:15:05.150
Today, I repay my debt.

01:15:10.727 --> 01:15:12.763
Aww...

01:15:13.521 --> 01:15:15.716
<i>En garde!</i>

01:15:19.109 --> 01:15:22.021
<i>He's gotta be strong And
he's gotta be fast.</i>

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.636
<i>And he's gotta be
fresh From the fight.</i>

01:15:25.867 --> 01:15:28.620
<i>- I need a hero.
- Stop!</i>

01:15:33.165 --> 01:15:37.681
- Hey, you! Back away from my wife.
- Shrek?

01:15:38.754 --> 01:15:43.111
You couldn't just go back to your
swamp and leave well enough alone.

01:15:43.384 --> 01:15:45.579
- Now!
- Pigs und blanket!

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:49.863
Pinocchio! Get the wand!

01:15:50.015 --> 01:15:51.687
I see London! I see France!

01:15:51.850 --> 01:15:53.124
Whah!

01:15:55.437 --> 01:15:56.836
I'm a real boy!

01:16:03.028 --> 01:16:04.859
Ah! Ah! Aaahh!

01:16:06.740 --> 01:16:07.695
Catch!

01:16:08.992 --> 01:16:10.061
Donkey!

01:16:12.829 --> 01:16:13.784
Oh!

01:16:14.372 --> 01:16:15.805
I'm a real boy. Aah!

01:16:15.957 --> 01:16:17.356
Oh!

01:16:19.251 --> 01:16:20.604
- Ha!
- Ah.

01:16:20.795 --> 01:16:22.433
That's mine!

01:16:26.676 --> 01:16:28.155
Pray for mercy, from Puss...

01:16:28.344 --> 01:16:29.857
And Donkey!

01:16:30.012 --> 01:16:32.845
She's taken the potion!
Kiss her now!

01:16:36.352 --> 01:16:37.307
No!

01:16:54.953 --> 01:16:56.909
Hi-ya!

01:16:59.082 --> 01:17:01.357
- Fiona.
- Shrek.

01:17:01.543 --> 01:17:05.377
Harold! You were supposed
to give her the potion!

01:17:05.630 --> 01:17:09.339
Well, I guess I gave
her the wrong tea.

01:17:09.634 --> 01:17:11.864
- Mommy!
- Mommy?

01:17:12.595 --> 01:17:15.234
I told you.

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:19.424
Ogres don't live
happily ever after.

01:17:29.279 --> 01:17:30.997
Woo!

01:17:31.155 --> 01:17:32.304
Ha!

01:17:43.166 --> 01:17:45.077
Oh, Dad!

01:17:49.131 --> 01:17:50.928
- Is he?
- Yup.

01:17:52.426 --> 01:17:54.098
He croaked.

01:17:56.388 --> 01:17:57.537
Harold?

01:17:57.681 --> 01:17:59.433
Dad?

01:17:59.599 --> 01:18:01.908
I'd hoped you'd never
see me like this.

01:18:02.102 --> 01:18:04.218
- And he gave you a hard time!
- Donkey!

01:18:04.395 --> 01:18:06.545
No, no, he's right. I'm sorry.

01:18:07.565 --> 01:18:08.600
To both of you.

01:18:08.733 --> 01:18:11.566
I only wanted what
was best for Fiona.

01:18:12.696 --> 01:18:14.846
But I can see now...

01:18:15.031 --> 01:18:16.623
she already has it.

01:18:17.742 --> 01:18:19.778
Shrek, Fiona...

01:18:19.952 --> 01:18:24.582
Will you accept an old
frog's apologies...

01:18:24.874 --> 01:18:27.593
and my blessing?

01:18:27.793 --> 01:18:29.943
Harold? I'm sorry, Lillian.

01:18:30.129 --> 01:18:33.519
I just wish I could be
the man you deserve.

01:18:34.926 --> 01:18:37.963
You're more that man today
than you ever were...

01:18:38.179 --> 01:18:40.056
warts and all.

01:18:44.142 --> 01:18:46.337
Boss! The Happily
Ever After Potion!

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:47.589
Midnight!

01:18:48.396 --> 01:18:51.194
Fiona. Is this what you want?

01:18:52.359 --> 01:18:54.315
To be this way forever?

01:18:54.486 --> 01:18:58.001
- What?
- Because if you kiss me now...

01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.912
we can stay like this.

01:19:00.951 --> 01:19:02.862
You'd do that?

01:19:03.036 --> 01:19:04.913
- For me?
- Yes.

01:19:13.839 --> 01:19:16.512
I want what any princess wants.

01:19:16.716 --> 01:19:19.355
To live happily ever after...

01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:26.108
with the ogre I married.

01:19:29.311 --> 01:19:32.144
Whatever happens,
I must not cry!

01:19:32.356 --> 01:19:34.347
You cannot make me cry!

01:19:56.588 --> 01:19:57.862
Whoa!

01:19:59.550 --> 01:20:02.747
No. No, no. Aaah! Ow.

01:20:06.139 --> 01:20:07.777
Oh, no.

01:20:23.906 --> 01:20:28.536
Hey. You still look like a noble steed to me.

01:20:32.164 --> 01:20:35.440
Now, where were we?

01:20:35.667 --> 01:20:37.862
Oh. I remember.

01:20:45.052 --> 01:20:48.965
Hey! Isn't we supposed
to be having a fiesta?

01:20:49.222 --> 01:20:50.780
<i>Uno, dos, cuatro, hit it!</i>

01:20:58.107 --> 01:20:59.506
Puss and Donkey, y'all...

01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:02.289
<i>She's into superstitions.</i>

01:21:02.486 --> 01:21:04.954
<i>Black cats and voodoo dolls.</i>

01:21:05.155 --> 01:21:07.715
<i>- Sing it, Puss!
- I feel a premonition.</i>

01:21:07.907 --> 01:21:10.262
<i>That girl's gonna
make me fall.</i>

01:21:11.953 --> 01:21:12.908
Here we go!

01:21:13.037 --> 01:21:15.710
<i>She's into new sensations.</i>

01:21:15.915 --> 01:21:18.224
<i>New kicks in the candlelight.</i>

01:21:18.418 --> 01:21:20.978
<i>She's got a new addiction.</i>

01:21:21.171 --> 01:21:23.480
<i>For every day and night.</i>

01:21:23.673 --> 01:21:25.823
<i>She'll make you take
your clothes off.</i>

01:21:26.008 --> 01:21:29.045
<i>And go dancing in the rain.</i>

01:21:29.261 --> 01:21:31.172
<i>She'll make you live
her crazy life.</i>

01:21:31.347 --> 01:21:33.736
<i>But she'll take
away your pain.</i>

01:21:33.932 --> 01:21:37.288
<i>Like a bullet to your brain.</i>

01:21:37.519 --> 01:21:39.874
<i>Upside inside out.</i>

01:21:40.064 --> 01:21:42.259
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:21:44.110 --> 01:21:45.384
Hey gorgeous!

01:21:45.528 --> 01:21:47.996
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:21:48.197 --> 01:21:50.427
<i>Her lips are devil red.</i>

01:21:50.616 --> 01:21:52.846
<i>And her skin's the
colour of mocha.</i>

01:21:53.034 --> 01:21:55.832
<i>She will wear you out.</i>

01:21:56.037 --> 01:21:58.631
<i>- Living la vida loca.
- She livin' it loca!</i>

01:21:58.831 --> 01:22:00.264
<i>Living la vida loca</i>

01:22:00.417 --> 01:22:03.932
<i>- Say it one more time now!
- Living the vida loca</i>

01:22:09.426 --> 01:22:13.135
Hey, Donkey, that's Spanish!

01:22:13.388 --> 01:22:14.821
<i>She'll push and pull you down.</i>

01:22:14.972 --> 01:22:17.486
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:22:17.683 --> 01:22:20.197
<i>She will wear you out.</i>

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:22.828
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:22:23.023 --> 01:22:26.095
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:28.467
<i>She'll push and pull you down.</i>

01:22:28.653 --> 01:22:31.008
<i>Living the vida loca.</i>

01:22:31.197 --> 01:22:33.586
<i>Her lips are devil red.</i>

01:22:33.782 --> 01:22:36.091
<i>And her skin's the
colour of mocha.</i>

01:22:36.285 --> 01:22:39.721
<i>She will wear you out.</i>

01:22:39.955 --> 01:22:41.513
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:22:41.665 --> 01:22:44.259
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:46.849
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:22:47.046 --> 01:22:49.844
<i>Living la vida loca.</i>

01:24:06.623 --> 01:24:07.707
<i>All by myself.</i>

01:24:07.708 --> 01:24:09.858
<i>All by myself.</i>

01:24:10.043 --> 01:24:11.396
<i>Don't wanna be.</i>

01:24:11.545 --> 01:24:15.982
<i>All by myself anymore...</i>

01:24:16.257 --> 01:24:18.691
Amigo, we are off to
the Kit-Kat Club.

01:24:18.885 --> 01:24:20.159
Come on, join us.

01:24:20.303 --> 01:24:24.216
Thanks, compadre. I'm...
I'm not in the mood.

01:24:24.473 --> 01:24:27.704
<i>We will cheer you up!
Find you a nice burro!</i>

01:24:29.521 --> 01:24:30.510
Hey, baby!

01:24:32.732 --> 01:24:36.884
Hey, that's my girl!
Yeah! All right!

01:24:37.153 --> 01:24:38.268
Baby, where you been?

01:24:38.404 --> 01:24:40.599
I'm sorry, too.

01:24:40.781 --> 01:24:43.420
I should've stayed. But Shrek
had this thing he had to do.

01:24:43.617 --> 01:24:45.096
What? Say it one more time.

01:24:45.243 --> 01:24:47.711
What you talking about?
Are you serious?

01:24:50.416 --> 01:24:52.168
Papa!

01:24:58.882 --> 01:25:01.157
Look at our little
mutant babies!
