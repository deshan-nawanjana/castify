WEBVTT

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.613
Shit!

00:01:45.772 --> 00:01:47.137
Andrew, hey.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.634
Here you go. Your regular lattes.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:55.876
Literally saved my life.
Thank you. Thank you.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.588
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.895
- Yeah.
- Me too.

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:18.634
Hello, Frank? How's my favorite writer?

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:20.332
Of course you've been
thinking about our talk

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:22.034
because you know I'm right.

00:02:22.075 --> 00:02:23.975
Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.103
and they hate to read.
They need someone they can trust to say,

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.478
<i>"Hey! Don't watch
CSl: Indianapolis tonight.</i>

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:31.916
Read a book! Read Frank's book. "
And that person is Oprah.

00:02:37.257 --> 00:02:38.986
- Cuttin' it close.
- One of those mornings.

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:40.515
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.824
Sweet...

00:02:42.862 --> 00:02:44.523
- Uh, sorry.
... Jesus!

00:02:44.564 --> 00:02:46.464
Rub some dirt on it, brother.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:49.957
Frank, the truth is all
A- plus novelists do publicity.

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.702
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.641
Frank! Can I tell you what else
they have in common? A Pulitzer.

00:02:57.343 --> 00:02:59.277
I need the shirt off
your back. Literally.

00:02:59.312 --> 00:03:02.770
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

00:03:02.815 --> 00:03:05.215
two company seats for your shirt.
You have five seconds to decide.

00:03:05.251 --> 00:03:06.912
Five, four, three, two, one.

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.443
I know...

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.752
- Shh!
- Later.

00:03:15.995 --> 00:03:17.826
Uh-oh.

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:27.697
Uh, hello. Hello?

00:03:34.414 --> 00:03:36.314
Morning, boss. You have a
conference call in 30 minutes.

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.317
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:39.716
Staff meeting at 9:00.

00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:41.310
Did you call, um...
What's her name?

00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:43.788
The one with the ugly hands.

00:03:43.823 --> 00:03:44.847
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:46.290
Yes. I did call her. I told her that

00:03:46.326 --> 00:03:48.021
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

00:03:48.061 --> 00:03:50.461
you won't give her a release date.
Your immigration lawyer called.

00:03:50.496 --> 00:03:51.622
He said it's imperative...

00:03:51.664 --> 00:03:53.325
Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:54.799
and keep the lawyer on the sheets.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:56.301
Oh, and get a hold of PR,

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:57.769
have them start drafting
a press release.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.271
<i>Frank is doing Oprah.</i>

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.830
Wow. Nicely done.

00:04:01.874 --> 00:04:05.071
If I want your praise,
I will ask for it.

00:04:07.146 --> 00:04:09.080
Um...

00:04:09.115 --> 00:04:10.776
Who is, uh, who is Jillian?

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.513
And why does she want me to call her?

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:18.657
Well, that was originally my cup.

00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:20.659
And I'm drinking your coffee why?

00:04:20.693 --> 00:04:22.718
Because your coffee spilled.

00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:32.235
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:35.332
I do. It's like Christmas in a cup.

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:36.808
Is that a coincidence?

00:04:36.843 --> 00:04:39.243
Incredibly, it is.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.440
I mean I wouldn't possibly drink
the same coffee that you drink

00:04:41.481 --> 00:04:43.108
just in case yours spilled.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.946
That would be pathetic.

00:04:44.984 --> 00:04:47.009
Morning. Miss Tate's office.

00:04:47.053 --> 00:04:48.350
Hey, Bob.

00:04:50.023 --> 00:04:53.254
Actually, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.057
Why are we headed to Bob's office?

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:08.565
Oop!

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:13.570
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

00:05:13.613 --> 00:05:16.173
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.580
- Can I say something?
- No.

00:05:17.617 --> 00:05:19.676
I've read thousands of manuscripts,

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:21.118
and this is the only one
I've given you.

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:22.883
There's an incredible novel in there.

00:05:22.922 --> 00:05:24.822
The kind of novel you used to publish.

00:05:24.857 --> 00:05:28.156
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

00:05:28.194 --> 00:05:30.685
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.992
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:33.259
if you didn't spill in the first place.

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:34.732
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:36.735
Won't say a word.

00:05:39.205 --> 00:05:44.142
Ah! Our fearless leader and
her liege. Please, do come in.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:47.806
Oh. Beautiful breakfront. Is it new?

00:05:47.847 --> 00:05:50.873
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

00:05:50.917 --> 00:05:53.750
but, yes, it is new to my office.

00:05:53.786 --> 00:05:55.413
Witty.

00:05:55.455 --> 00:05:58.083
Bob, I'm letting you go.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:02.718
Pardon?

00:06:02.762 --> 00:06:05.856
<i>I asked you over a dozen times to get
Frank to do Oprah, and you didn't do it.</i>

00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:07.991
You're fired.

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:11.564
I have told you that is impossible.

00:06:11.604 --> 00:06:14.004
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.735
Well that is
interesting, because I just

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:18.266
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:20.944
Excuse me?

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.379
You didn't even call him, did you?

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.512
- But...
- I know, I know.

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:28.782
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

00:06:28.821 --> 00:06:32.052
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.559
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:40.724
What's his twenty?

00:06:40.767 --> 00:06:44.430
<i>He's moving. He has crazy eyes.</i>

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.563
Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it.

00:06:46.606 --> 00:06:50.599
You poisonous bitch!

00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.304
You can't fire me!

00:06:52.345 --> 00:06:54.643
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:56.443
Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing

00:06:56.482 --> 00:06:58.382
just so that you can
look good to the board?

00:06:58.418 --> 00:07:01.410
Because you are threatened by me!

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:04.321
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:07.656
Just because you have
no semblance of a life

00:07:07.693 --> 00:07:09.456
outside of this office,

00:07:09.495 --> 00:07:11.622
you think that you can treat all of us

00:07:11.664 --> 00:07:13.325
like your own personal slaves.

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:15.926
You know what? I feel sorry for you.

00:07:15.968 --> 00:07:18.698
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

00:07:18.738 --> 00:07:20.763
Nothing and no one.

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:27.169
Listen carefully, Bob.

00:07:27.213 --> 00:07:30.808
I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.251
<i>I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent</i>

00:07:34.287 --> 00:07:35.948
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

00:07:35.988 --> 00:07:37.319
than you do in your office.

00:07:37.356 --> 00:07:38.687
And if you say another word,

00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:41.022
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.585
Another word and you're
going out of here

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:44.891
with an armed escort.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:46.796
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.460
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

00:07:48.501 --> 00:07:49.729
- What was it?
- YouTube?

00:07:49.769 --> 00:07:52.203
Exactly. Is that what you want?

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:53.865
Didn't think so. I have work to do.

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:58.234
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.403
and put it in my conference room.

00:07:59.445 --> 00:08:00.469
Will do.

00:08:00.513 --> 00:08:01.605
And I need you around this weekend

00:08:01.647 --> 00:08:03.012
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.643
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:07.710
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

00:08:07.753 --> 00:08:09.152
so I was gonna go home and...

00:08:09.188 --> 00:08:10.985
...it's fine. I'll cancel it.

00:08:11.023 --> 00:08:12.957
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:15.290
so it's... good talk, yeah.

00:08:15.328 --> 00:08:20.425
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

00:08:20.466 --> 00:08:22.024
Mom. What do you want me to tell you?

00:08:22.068 --> 00:08:24.502
She's making me work the weekend.

00:08:24.537 --> 00:08:25.834
No, I'm not... no.

00:08:25.872 --> 00:08:27.430
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:28.565
to throw it all away, OK?

00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:30.098
I'm sure that Dad is pissed,

00:08:30.142 --> 00:08:33.043
but we take all of our submissions
around here very seriously.

00:08:33.079 --> 00:08:36.480
We'll get back to
you as soon as we can.

00:08:36.516 --> 00:08:38.507
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.280
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:43.516
Miss Tate's office.

00:08:43.556 --> 00:08:46.252
Oh... Yeah. OK. All right.

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:48.385
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

00:08:48.427 --> 00:08:51.021
OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

00:08:51.063 --> 00:08:52.087
Okey-doke.

00:08:57.737 --> 00:08:59.432
Good morning, Miss Tate.

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.666
Jack, Edwin.

00:09:03.709 --> 00:09:05.472
<i>Margaret, congratulations
on the Oprah thing.</i>

00:09:05.511 --> 00:09:07.376
- That's terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

00:09:07.413 --> 00:09:10.280
This isn't about my second raise, is it?
Just kidding.

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:13.945
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:16.011
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

00:09:16.055 --> 00:09:17.454
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:19.390
while your visa application
was being processed?

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.449
Yes. I do.

00:09:20.493 --> 00:09:22.859
And... you went to Frankfurt.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:25.090
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

00:09:25.131 --> 00:09:27.156
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

00:09:27.199 --> 00:09:28.564
It seems that the
United States Government

00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:30.626
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:33.434
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

00:09:33.472 --> 00:09:36.100
Great. So, we're all good?
Everything good?

00:09:36.142 --> 00:09:38.610
Margaret, your visa application
has been denied.

00:09:38.644 --> 00:09:41.807
And you are being deported.

00:09:41.847 --> 00:09:42.973
Deported?

00:09:43.015 --> 00:09:44.710
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

00:09:44.750 --> 00:09:46.115
that you didn't fill out in time.

00:09:46.152 --> 00:09:50.612
Come on. Come on! It's not
like I'm even an immigrant!

00:09:50.656 --> 00:09:52.647
I'm from Canada, for Christ's sake.

00:09:52.692 --> 00:09:55.058
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:57.062
We can reapply, but unfortunately

00:09:57.096 --> 00:10:00.088
you have to leave the country
for at least a year.

00:10:02.134 --> 00:10:07.037
OK. OK, well, that's
not ideal, but, uh...

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:08.870
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

00:10:08.908 --> 00:10:10.068
No, Margaret.

00:10:10.109 --> 00:10:11.406
...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.570
Unfortunately, Margaret,

00:10:12.612 --> 00:10:15.308
if you're deported,
you can't work for an American company.

00:10:15.348 --> 00:10:17.748
Until this is resolved I'm going
to turn operations over

00:10:17.783 --> 00:10:18.977
to Bob Spaulding.

00:10:19.018 --> 00:10:21.680
Bob Spaulding? The guy I just fired?

00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:23.120
We need an editor in chief.

00:10:23.155 --> 00:10:25.521
He is the only person in the building
who has enough experience.

00:10:25.558 --> 00:10:27.389
- You cannot be serious. I beg of you.
- Margaret.

00:10:27.426 --> 00:10:29.394
We are desperate to have you stay.

00:10:29.428 --> 00:10:32.397
If there was any way, any way at all

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:33.989
that we could make this work,
we'd be doing it.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.159
There is no way...

00:10:35.201 --> 00:10:36.225
I am begging you.

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:37.895
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

00:10:37.937 --> 00:10:39.495
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

00:10:39.538 --> 00:10:42.098
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

00:10:42.141 --> 00:10:43.199
- I know.
- She's on hold.

00:10:43.242 --> 00:10:46.177
She needs to speak with you right away.
I told her you were otherwise engaged.

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.772
She insisted, so... sorry.

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.441
So...

00:11:00.426 --> 00:11:02.451
Uh...

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:05.096
Come here.

00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:11.299
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:14.431
the predicament that we are in.

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:16.134
And, um...

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:20.240
And there's, uh... well...

00:11:20.279 --> 00:11:22.907
I think there's something
that you should know.

00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.651
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.780
We are getting married.

00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:31.449
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:34.254
You and I are getting married! Yes.

00:11:34.293 --> 00:11:35.954
- We are.
- Getting married.

00:11:35.995 --> 00:11:37.428
- We are getting married.
- Yes.

00:11:39.198 --> 00:11:41.291
Isn't he your secretary?

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:42.391
Assistant.

00:11:42.435 --> 00:11:46.166
Executive, uh...
assistant secretary. Titles.

00:11:46.205 --> 00:11:50.471
But, wouldn't be the first time
one of us fell for our secretaries.

00:11:50.509 --> 00:11:52.500
Would it, Edwin?

00:11:52.545 --> 00:11:54.775
With Laquisha. Remember?

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:58.341
So, yeah... The truth is,

00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:02.514
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two people

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.716
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

00:12:04.757 --> 00:12:06.088
No.

00:12:06.125 --> 00:12:11.153
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

00:12:11.197 --> 00:12:12.255
- Yeah...
- No.

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:14.960
- Something happened.
- Something.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.128
Yeah. Tried to fight it and...

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.797
Can't, can't fight a...

00:12:19.839 --> 00:12:24.299
Can't fight a love like ours, so, uh...

00:12:24.343 --> 00:12:27.744
Uh... Are we good with this?
Are you happy?

00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.648
Because, well... we are happy. So happy.

00:12:31.684 --> 00:12:32.810
- Margaret.
- Yes?

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:34.752
It's terrific.

00:12:34.787 --> 00:12:36.516
Just make it legal. Mmm?

00:12:36.555 --> 00:12:39.183
Oh! Legal.

00:12:39.225 --> 00:12:42.558
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

00:12:42.595 --> 00:12:44.893
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:47.558
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.465
Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

00:12:49.502 --> 00:12:50.560
We will do that right away.

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.798
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

00:12:52.838 --> 00:12:55.068
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:59.745
Margaret
and Andrew are getting married!

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.076
What is that about?

00:13:01.113 --> 00:13:03.172
Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

00:13:03.215 --> 00:13:04.546
Yeah.

00:13:04.583 --> 00:13:06.346
What is he thinking?

00:13:06.385 --> 00:13:07.477
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

00:13:09.588 --> 00:13:12.182
Dude, for real. Her?

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.488
Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

00:13:36.448 --> 00:13:37.472
What?

00:13:38.851 --> 00:13:40.751
I don't understand what's happening.

00:13:40.786 --> 00:13:42.754
Relax. This is for you, too.

00:13:42.788 --> 00:13:44.119
Do explain.

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:46.386
They were going to make Bob chief.

00:13:46.425 --> 00:13:48.086
So naturally I would have to marry you.

00:13:48.127 --> 00:13:49.719
And what's the problem?

00:13:49.762 --> 00:13:52.094
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

00:13:52.131 --> 00:13:55.259
I like to think so.
Besides, it's illegal.

00:13:55.301 --> 00:13:58.498
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

00:13:58.537 --> 00:14:00.061
- Margaret.
- Yes?

00:14:00.105 --> 00:14:03.165
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:06.235
Because if you don't marry me, your
dreams of touching the lives of millions

00:14:06.278 --> 00:14:08.007
with the written word are dead.

00:14:13.953 --> 00:14:16.478
Bob is gonna fire you the second
I'm gone. Guaranteed.

00:14:16.522 --> 00:14:18.581
That means you're out on the street
alone looking for a job.

00:14:18.624 --> 00:14:21.115
That means all the time that
we spent together, all the lattes,

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.355
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:26.694
were all for nothing and all your dreams
of being an editor are gone.

00:14:26.732 --> 00:14:29.132
But don't worry, after the required
allotment of time,

00:14:29.168 --> 00:14:30.635
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.500
But until then, like it or not,

00:14:32.538 --> 00:14:34.472
your wagon is hitched to mine. OK?

00:14:34.506 --> 00:14:36.701
Phone.

00:14:50.956 --> 00:14:52.617
- This way.
- Margaret.

00:14:52.658 --> 00:14:54.683
- Come.
- The line...

00:14:54.727 --> 00:14:55.751
Next, please.

00:14:55.794 --> 00:14:57.421
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

00:14:57.463 --> 00:14:58.987
Sorry, I just need to ask him something.

00:14:59.031 --> 00:15:01.829
I need for you to file this
fianc�e visa for me, please.

00:15:06.472 --> 00:15:08.872
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:10.967
Please, come with me.

00:15:11.010 --> 00:15:13.570
Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

00:15:14.747 --> 00:15:16.977
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:15:20.653 --> 00:15:22.018
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

00:15:22.054 --> 00:15:24.545
Hi. I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:26.649
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

00:15:26.692 --> 00:15:28.023
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

00:15:28.060 --> 00:15:29.857
...Margaret. Sorry about the wait.

00:15:29.895 --> 00:15:31.556
<i>It's a, uh, crazy day today.</i>

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.758
Oh, of course, of course. We understand.

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.824
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

00:15:35.868 --> 00:15:39.929
- on such short notice.
- OK.

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:42.463
<i># Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh
buh, buh, buh, buuuh</i>

00:15:42.508 --> 00:15:44.339
So, I have one question for you.

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:47.573
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:51.709
so she can keep her position
as editor in chief at Colden Books?

00:15:53.285 --> 00:15:55.378
- That's ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

00:15:55.421 --> 00:15:57.719
We had a phone tip this afternoon
from a man named...

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:59.519
Would it be Bob Spaulding?

00:15:59.558 --> 00:16:00.889
Bob Spaulding.

00:16:00.926 --> 00:16:04.225
Bob. Poor Bob. I am so sorry.

00:16:04.263 --> 00:16:08.199
Bob is nothing but a disgruntled
former employee.

00:16:08.233 --> 00:16:09.325
<i>And I apologize.</i>

00:16:09.368 --> 00:16:12.064
But we know you're incredibly busy

00:16:12.104 --> 00:16:15.972
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:17.566
If you just give us our next step,

00:16:17.609 --> 00:16:19.634
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

00:16:20.746 --> 00:16:22.304
Miss Tate, please.

00:16:23.716 --> 00:16:27.846
Let me explain to you the
process that's about to unfold.

00:16:27.886 --> 00:16:31.287
Step one will be a scheduled interview.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:34.850
I'll put you each in a room,
and I'll ask you every little question

00:16:34.893 --> 00:16:36.861
that a real couple
would know about each other.

00:16:36.895 --> 00:16:41.093
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:43.465
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

00:16:43.502 --> 00:16:45.936
If your answers don't match up
at every point,

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:48.633
you will be deported indefinitely.

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:51.074
And you, young man,
will have committed a felony...

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:55.103
...punishable by a fine of $250,000

00:16:55.147 --> 00:16:59.379
and a stay of five years
in federal prison.

00:17:02.488 --> 00:17:05.719
So, Andrew.

00:17:05.758 --> 00:17:09.159
You wanna... you want to talk to me?

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.795
No?

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.769
Yes?

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.740
The truth is...

00:17:27.813 --> 00:17:32.580
Mr. Gilbertson, the truth is...

00:17:32.618 --> 00:17:34.381
Margaret and I...

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.124
...are just two people

00:17:39.158 --> 00:17:42.150
who weren't supposed to fall in love.

00:17:43.028 --> 00:17:44.723
But did.

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:48.762
We couldn't tell anyone we work with

00:17:48.801 --> 00:17:51.395
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

00:17:51.437 --> 00:17:52.904
- Promotion?
- Yeah.

00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:56.772
- Your?
- We... we both felt, uh...

00:17:56.809 --> 00:18:00.939
...that it would be deeply inappropriate
if I were to be promoted to editor.

00:18:00.979 --> 00:18:03.641
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
... while we were...

00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:07.710
So...

00:18:07.753 --> 00:18:10.813
Have the two of you told your parents
about your secret love?

00:18:10.856 --> 00:18:14.189
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

00:18:14.226 --> 00:18:16.490
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

00:18:16.528 --> 00:18:18.826
Are your parents dead?

00:18:18.864 --> 00:18:21.025
- Oh, no, his are very much alive.
- No... very much.

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:24.365
Very much. They're, ah... Well,
we were gonna tell them this weekend.

00:18:24.403 --> 00:18:28.362
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the whole
family's coming together.

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:29.999
And we thought it'd be a nice surprise.

00:18:30.042 --> 00:18:32.067
And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.204
At Andrew's parents' house.

00:18:34.246 --> 00:18:35.372
Where is that located again?

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:38.042
Um...
Why am I doing all the talking?

00:18:38.083 --> 00:18:39.448
It's your parents' house.

00:18:39.485 --> 00:18:40.918
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:45.084
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

00:18:45.124 --> 00:18:47.149
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

00:18:47.192 --> 00:18:49.285
You're gonna go to Alaska this weekend?

00:18:50.829 --> 00:18:52.797
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

00:18:52.831 --> 00:18:56.028
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, that's where...

00:18:56.068 --> 00:18:58.969
That's where my little...
that's where my Andrew's from.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:01.837
OK.

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:05.332
Fine. I see how this is gonna go.

00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:08.312
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

00:19:08.347 --> 00:19:10.315
for your scheduled interview,

00:19:10.349 --> 00:19:13.750
and your answers better
match up on every account.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.352
- Thank you.
- Hello?

00:19:16.388 --> 00:19:18.481
- I'm looking forward to this one.
- We're looking forward to this one.

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:19.582
Thank you.

00:19:19.625 --> 00:19:22.389
Gonna be fun.
I'll be checking up on you.

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:23.451
You got it.

00:19:28.567 --> 00:19:32.867
OK... so, what's gonna happen is
we will go up there.

00:19:32.905 --> 00:19:34.930
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

00:19:34.973 --> 00:19:36.565
tell your parents we're engaged.

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:38.200
Uh, use the miles for the tickets.

00:19:38.243 --> 00:19:41.940
I guess I will pop for you to fly first
class. But make sure you use the miles.

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.311
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:45.282
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

00:19:45.317 --> 00:19:47.285
'Cause last time they actually
gave it to a vegan,

00:19:47.319 --> 00:19:48.946
and they, uh... forced me to eat

00:19:48.987 --> 00:19:51.478
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

00:19:51.523 --> 00:19:53.514
Hey, I'm... Why aren't you taking notes?

00:19:53.559 --> 00:19:55.891
I'm sorry, were you not in that room?

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:57.293
What? What?

00:19:58.664 --> 00:20:01.155
Oh! The thing you said about
being promoted?

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.191
Genius! Genius.
He completely fell for it.

00:20:03.235 --> 00:20:04.497
I was serious.

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:07.437
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

00:20:07.472 --> 00:20:08.666
That changes things.

00:20:08.707 --> 00:20:12.837
- Promote you to editor? No, no way.
- Then I quit, and you're screwed.

00:20:12.878 --> 00:20:13.902
Bye-bye, Margaret.

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:15.413
- Andrew!
- It really has been

00:20:15.447 --> 00:20:18.848
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

00:20:20.185 --> 00:20:22.119
I'll make you editor. Fine.

00:20:22.154 --> 00:20:25.749
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

00:20:25.791 --> 00:20:28.692
I will make you editor. Happy?

00:20:28.727 --> 00:20:31.127
- And not in two years. Right away.
- Fine.

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.653
And you'll publish my manuscript.

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:35.864
Ten thousand copy first...

00:20:35.901 --> 00:20:37.459
Twenty thousand copies, first run.

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:39.436
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

00:20:39.471 --> 00:20:41.098
when I want and how I want.

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:43.437
Now, ask me nicely.

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:44.635
"Ask you nicely" what?

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:48.442
Ask me nicely to marry you, Margaret.

00:20:50.482 --> 00:20:53.508
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

00:21:02.661 --> 00:21:03.685
Fine.

00:21:12.104 --> 00:21:14.436
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

00:21:14.473 --> 00:21:16.634
- Will you marry me?
- No.

00:21:16.675 --> 00:21:18.233
Say it like you mean it.

00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.247
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

00:21:24.283 --> 00:21:27.377
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

00:21:27.419 --> 00:21:30.411
Would you please,
with cherries on top, marry me?

00:21:33.025 --> 00:21:35.687
OK. I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
but I'll do it.

00:21:35.727 --> 00:21:38.355
- See you at the airport tomorrow.
- Good.

00:21:51.276 --> 00:21:54.768
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

00:21:54.813 --> 00:21:57.805
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

00:21:57.849 --> 00:21:59.544
but the bad news is
that you have four days

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:04.385
to learn all this about me.
So, you should... probably get studying.

00:22:07.959 --> 00:22:10.223
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

00:22:10.262 --> 00:22:12.287
- Scary, isn't it?
- A little bit.

00:22:12.331 --> 00:22:14.731
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

00:22:14.766 --> 00:22:16.700
And the full spectrum of human emotion.

00:22:16.735 --> 00:22:18.703
Oh, that's... that was funny.

00:22:18.737 --> 00:22:20.534
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

00:22:20.572 --> 00:22:23.439
Here's a good one. Do I have any scars?

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:25.375
I'm pretty sure that you have a tattoo.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:27.071
Oh, you're pretty sure?

00:22:27.112 --> 00:22:29.478
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

00:22:29.514 --> 00:22:31.448
and asked about a Q-switched laser.

00:22:31.483 --> 00:22:33.041
I of course Googled a Q-switched laser

00:22:33.085 --> 00:22:35.383
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.978
But you canceled your appointment.

00:22:38.557 --> 00:22:40.115
So what is it? Tribal ink?

00:22:40.158 --> 00:22:42.092
Japanese calligraphy? Barbed wire?

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:44.960
You know, it's exciting for me
to experience you like this.

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:47.260
Thank you. You're gonna have
to tell me where it is, though.

00:22:47.299 --> 00:22:48.766
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.325
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:53.565
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

00:22:53.605 --> 00:22:56.472
Oh, here's one. Whose place do we
stay at, yours or mine?

00:22:56.508 --> 00:22:57.907
That's easy. Mine.

00:22:57.943 --> 00:22:59.808
And why wouldn't we stay at mine?

00:22:59.845 --> 00:23:02.336
Because I live at Central Park West.

00:23:02.381 --> 00:23:05.316
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.319
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

00:23:08.353 --> 00:23:11.322
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.</i>

00:23:11.356 --> 00:23:13.950
<i>We are beginning our descent
into Juneau.</i>

00:23:13.992 --> 00:23:15.721
Juneau? I thought
we were going to Sitka.

00:23:16.995 --> 00:23:21.022
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.195
Whoa.

00:23:50.195 --> 00:23:53.460
All right. Here we go.

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.835
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

00:24:04.709 --> 00:24:06.370
Hi. Right this way...

00:24:09.948 --> 00:24:11.745
- Hi!
- Oh...

00:24:11.783 --> 00:24:14.377
- It's so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

00:24:14.419 --> 00:24:16.319
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

00:24:16.354 --> 00:24:19.118
Ah, Gammy. How are you doing?
Where's Dad?

00:24:19.157 --> 00:24:21.853
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

00:24:21.893 --> 00:24:24.259
Never mind about him. Where's your girl?

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:26.764
Uh, she's... right there.

00:24:26.798 --> 00:24:28.390
- Ah.
- There she is.

00:24:28.433 --> 00:24:31.402
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:32.767
Annie.

00:24:33.872 --> 00:24:34.896
- Hi!
- Hello.

00:24:34.940 --> 00:24:36.703
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

00:24:36.741 --> 00:24:39.175
Yeah, great. This is my gammy, Annie.

00:24:39.211 --> 00:24:42.305
- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

00:24:42.347 --> 00:24:47.341
Now, do you prefer being called Margaret
or Satan's Mistress?

00:24:47.385 --> 00:24:49.250
We've heard it both ways.

00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:51.084
Actually we've heard it
lots of ways.

00:24:51.122 --> 00:24:52.714
She's kidding.

00:24:52.757 --> 00:24:55.225
Oh! Oh... OK.

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.727
Thank you so much for...

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:58.456
allowing me to be a part
of this weekend.

00:24:58.497 --> 00:25:01.694
Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

00:25:01.733 --> 00:25:03.462
Let's get you two back to the fort.

00:25:03.502 --> 00:25:05.629
- OK.
- Oh...

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:08.696
- It's so good to see you.
- There we are.

00:25:42.574 --> 00:25:43.836
Andrew...

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:47.333
Andrew. Andrew!

00:25:49.214 --> 00:25:51.808
Please, don't do that.

00:25:51.850 --> 00:25:55.013
You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:58.250
He was probably just
being modest, dear.

00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.780
Oh.

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:10.360
What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

00:26:10.402 --> 00:26:12.802
Oh, we canceled your reservation.

00:26:12.837 --> 00:26:14.270
Family doesn't stay at a hotel.

00:26:14.306 --> 00:26:16.001
You're gonna stay in our home.

00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:18.032
Oh, great! Great.

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:19.475
- What?
- God.

00:26:19.511 --> 00:26:21.706
You're gonna wanna use your legs
to lift that one.

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:24.579
Andrew! Help her with those.

00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:27.107
I'd love to, but she won't let me
do anything.

00:26:27.152 --> 00:26:30.644
She insists on doing it all herself.
She's one of those... she's a feminist.

00:26:39.864 --> 00:26:41.092
Come on, sweetie.

00:26:42.567 --> 00:26:45.161
You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

00:26:54.713 --> 00:26:55.839
This is the last of 'em.

00:26:57.415 --> 00:26:58.677
- Oh!
- Ooh.

00:26:58.717 --> 00:27:01.880
- Five second rule.
- Got it!

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.252
That will dry right off.

00:27:04.289 --> 00:27:06.519
Psst! Psst!
I'm not getting on that boat.

00:27:06.558 --> 00:27:08.423
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.690
Psst! You know I can't swim.

00:27:10.729 --> 00:27:13.220
Hence, the boat.

00:27:20.205 --> 00:27:21.604
Come on.

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:28.079
Come on. Here we go.

00:27:34.819 --> 00:27:38.050
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

00:27:38.089 --> 00:27:40.148
Shh.

00:27:44.863 --> 00:27:47.058
She comes with a lot of baggage.

00:27:47.098 --> 00:27:48.429
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:53.337
Hand off ass! Off ass!

00:27:55.907 --> 00:27:59.001
There you go. You're there.

00:28:03.281 --> 00:28:07.308
Congratulations.
I'm a hundred years old now.

00:28:33.678 --> 00:28:35.805
Here we are. We're home.

00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:40.208
That is your home?

00:28:41.519 --> 00:28:43.646
Who are you people?

00:28:58.002 --> 00:28:59.526
Why did you tell me
you were poor?

00:28:59.571 --> 00:29:02.404
- I never said I was poor.
- But you never told me you were rich.

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.635
I'm not rich. My parents are rich.

00:29:04.676 --> 00:29:07.110
OK, you know what?
That's something only rich people say.

00:29:07.145 --> 00:29:08.669
Hey, Andrew! Welcome home!

00:29:08.713 --> 00:29:11.443
Hi! Mom, what is this?

00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:14.111
Nothing. It's just a little
welcoming party.

00:29:14.152 --> 00:29:15.380
Is that a crime?

00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:17.547
Just 50 of our closest
friends and neighbors.

00:29:17.589 --> 00:29:19.250
And all excited to meet you.

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.622
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

00:29:21.659 --> 00:29:23.957
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

00:29:23.995 --> 00:29:26.623
Come on. Let's go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

00:29:28.233 --> 00:29:29.632
Put your back into it.

00:29:35.273 --> 00:29:37.468
So nice to meet you,
Margaret. Welcome to Sitka.

00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:39.500
Jill? Hi. Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

00:29:39.544 --> 00:29:42.707
Why didn't you tell me you were
some kind of Alaskan Kennedy?

00:29:42.747 --> 00:29:43.805
How could I?

00:29:43.848 --> 00:29:47.340
We were in the middle of talking about
you for the last three years.

00:29:47.385 --> 00:29:49.080
OK, know what? Timeout, OK?

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.849
This bickering Bickerson thing
has got to stop.

00:29:50.889 --> 00:29:52.880
People need to think that we are
in love. So let's just...

00:29:52.924 --> 00:29:54.448
That, that's no problem.
I can do that.

00:29:54.492 --> 00:29:57.359
I can pretend to be the doting fianc�.
That's easy.

00:29:57.395 --> 00:29:58.862
But for you, it's going to require

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:01.297
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

00:30:01.332 --> 00:30:04.028
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

00:30:04.068 --> 00:30:05.433
I'll pick the right moment.

00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:09.338
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

00:30:09.374 --> 00:30:12.002
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

00:30:12.043 --> 00:30:14.034
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:15.943
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:17.379
Hi, how are you? Pleasure.

00:30:17.415 --> 00:30:20.816
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

00:30:20.852 --> 00:30:22.945
That's a great question, Louise.

00:30:22.987 --> 00:30:25.387
I'm curious to know the answer myself.

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.220
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:30.551
This must be Maggie.

00:30:30.595 --> 00:30:32.222
Uh, Margaret.

00:30:32.263 --> 00:30:35.721
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

00:30:35.767 --> 00:30:39.362
So why don't you tell us exactly
what a book editor does.

00:30:39.404 --> 00:30:42.862
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:45.273
Now that sounds like fun.

00:30:45.310 --> 00:30:47.107
No wonder you like being an editor.

00:30:47.145 --> 00:30:50.376
No, Louise. Andrew's not an editor,
he's an editor's assistant.

00:30:50.415 --> 00:30:52.906
Maggie here is the editor.

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:54.509
Margaret.

00:30:54.552 --> 00:30:58.044
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

00:30:58.089 --> 00:30:59.716
Well. How about that.

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:01.122
Huh.

00:31:01.159 --> 00:31:03.150
I think I'll get a refill.

00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:06.695
Charming.

00:31:10.501 --> 00:31:13.561
That's a hell of
a first impression, Dad.

00:31:13.605 --> 00:31:15.664
What the hell, Andrew?

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:18.471
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

00:31:18.509 --> 00:31:19.840
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

00:31:19.878 --> 00:31:21.175
Can we wait two seconds

00:31:21.212 --> 00:31:22.645
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:25.911
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:27.645
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

00:31:27.685 --> 00:31:29.312
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:30.446
She's your meal ticket,

00:31:30.488 --> 00:31:31.955
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:36.359
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fianc�e.

00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:38.954
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

00:31:38.997 --> 00:31:40.794
I'm getting married.

00:31:44.369 --> 00:31:46.269
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

00:31:46.304 --> 00:31:47.635
Would you care for
some hors d'oeuvres?

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:48.969
No, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:50.338
It's a tradition.

00:31:50.375 --> 00:31:52.036
It's the texture. I'm not a fish person.

00:31:52.076 --> 00:31:54.476
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:57.106
I think if you'll just taste it.

00:31:57.148 --> 00:31:58.547
Thank you so much.

00:32:02.387 --> 00:32:03.513
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:32:03.554 --> 00:32:06.045
I have a very important
announcement to make.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.682
Margaret and I are getting married.

00:32:07.725 --> 00:32:08.987
It's the paprika.

00:32:09.027 --> 00:32:10.392
So sorry.

00:32:10.428 --> 00:32:13.226
That's OK. It's wash-and-wear.

00:32:15.066 --> 00:32:18.058
Yep. Honey? Where you at?

00:32:19.270 --> 00:32:20.567
Here it is.

00:32:23.541 --> 00:32:25.236
Come on down here, pumpkin.

00:32:25.276 --> 00:32:27.073
- All right.
- OK.

00:32:27.111 --> 00:32:29.671
Oh, look at her. Look at her.

00:32:30.915 --> 00:32:33.349
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

00:32:33.384 --> 00:32:35.818
Congratulations, Andrew.

00:32:35.853 --> 00:32:36.877
Thank you.

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:38.786
Thank you very much.

00:32:38.823 --> 00:32:41.383
- Time to celebrate.
- Get the champagne.

00:32:44.362 --> 00:32:45.989
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:47.224
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

00:32:47.265 --> 00:32:48.926
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:50.935
Andrew. Hi.

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:54.905
Gert? Oh, my God. Hey, hi. Wow.

00:32:54.939 --> 00:32:57.373
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

00:32:57.408 --> 00:33:00.673
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

00:33:00.712 --> 00:33:03.203
- Right.
- And...

00:33:03.247 --> 00:33:06.182
...we're being completely rude. Hi.

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:09.414
- Oh, God. This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

00:33:09.454 --> 00:33:11.888
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

00:33:11.923 --> 00:33:14.118
Well, congratulations, you guys.

00:33:14.158 --> 00:33:15.591
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:33:15.626 --> 00:33:17.150
So did I miss the story?

00:33:17.962 --> 00:33:19.122
- What story?
- What story?

00:33:19.163 --> 00:33:20.926
About how you proposed.

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:25.299
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

00:33:25.336 --> 00:33:27.395
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

00:33:27.438 --> 00:33:30.066
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

00:33:30.108 --> 00:33:31.234
Would you tell us?

00:33:31.275 --> 00:33:33.607
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:33:33.644 --> 00:33:35.509
You know what?

00:33:35.546 --> 00:33:39.539
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

00:33:39.584 --> 00:33:42.144
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:44.381
'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

00:33:44.422 --> 00:33:47.721
Huh! Wow, OK.

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:51.593
Wow, where to begin... this story.

00:33:51.629 --> 00:33:54.621
Well... um, wow.

00:33:54.665 --> 00:33:56.724
Mmm... yeah.

00:33:56.768 --> 00:34:01.637
OK, well, um, Andrew and I...

00:34:01.672 --> 00:34:04.436
Andrew and I were about to celebrate

00:34:04.475 --> 00:34:07.069
- our first anniversary together.
- Aw...

00:34:07.111 --> 00:34:09.944
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:13.178
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

00:34:13.217 --> 00:34:15.617
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:18.417
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

00:34:18.456 --> 00:34:21.289
That's not exactly how it happened.

00:34:21.325 --> 00:34:22.815
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.420
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

00:34:25.463 --> 00:34:27.488
This woman's about as subtle as a gun.

00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.762
Yeah.

00:34:29.801 --> 00:34:31.132
What I was worried about was

00:34:31.169 --> 00:34:33.034
that she might find this little box...

00:34:33.071 --> 00:34:36.097
Oh! The decoupage box that he made

00:34:36.140 --> 00:34:38.301
where he'd taken the time to cut out

00:34:38.342 --> 00:34:41.106
tiny, little pictures of himself. Yes.

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:44.842
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

00:34:44.882 --> 00:34:47.316
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

00:34:47.351 --> 00:34:51.219
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

00:34:51.255 --> 00:34:55.351
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

00:34:55.393 --> 00:34:58.055
...the most beautiful, big...

00:34:58.096 --> 00:34:59.620
...fat nothing.

00:34:59.664 --> 00:35:01.029
No ring.

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.657
- No ring?
- What?

00:35:02.700 --> 00:35:05.692
No. But inside that box...

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:07.397
...underneath all that crap...

00:35:07.438 --> 00:35:09.702
...there was a little
handwritten note...

00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:13.267
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

00:35:13.311 --> 00:35:15.006
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.411
Yeah.

00:35:16.447 --> 00:35:18.278
Masculine.

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.181
Anyway, naturally, Margaret thought...

00:35:20.218 --> 00:35:21.776
I thought he was seeing someone else.

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:23.946
It was a terrible time for me,

00:35:23.988 --> 00:35:26.354
but I went to that hotel anyway.

00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:28.483
I went there and I pounded on the door,

00:35:28.526 --> 00:35:30.357
but the door was already unlocked.

00:35:30.394 --> 00:35:34.262
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

00:35:34.298 --> 00:35:35.822
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.425
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

00:35:37.468 --> 00:35:40.926
in a tuxedo. Your son. Your son.

00:35:40.972 --> 00:35:44.533
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

00:35:44.575 --> 00:35:47.840
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

00:35:47.879 --> 00:35:48.937
he said to me...

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.038
"Margaret, will you marry me?"

00:35:50.081 --> 00:35:53.414
And she said, "Yep. "
The end. Who's hungry?

00:35:55.786 --> 00:35:58.448
That is quite a story.

00:35:58.489 --> 00:36:00.389
- Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

00:36:00.424 --> 00:36:02.858
You are so sensitive.

00:36:03.661 --> 00:36:06.653
Hand-cut confetti?

00:36:06.697 --> 00:36:09.530
Hey! Let's see a kiss
from you two cuties.

00:36:09.567 --> 00:36:10.659
Give her a kiss!

00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:12.760
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

00:36:12.803 --> 00:36:13.827
Come on!

00:36:13.871 --> 00:36:15.429
OK, all right.

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:17.338
OK. Here we go. Ready?

00:36:18.976 --> 00:36:23.242
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

00:36:23.281 --> 00:36:26.876
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- Kiss her!

00:36:26.918 --> 00:36:30.820
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

00:36:30.855 --> 00:36:32.482
OK!

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:34.716
- OK. All right.
- OK.

00:36:34.759 --> 00:36:36.920
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

00:36:38.629 --> 00:36:40.426
Oh!

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:43.092
Andy! Give her a real kiss!

00:36:43.134 --> 00:36:45.796
- Gammy.
- A real one!

00:36:45.836 --> 00:36:47.360
- Yeah.
- You can do it!

00:36:47.405 --> 00:36:49.066
Why don't we just do it?
Let's just do it really fast.

00:36:50.074 --> 00:36:52.668
Mmmm.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:55.645
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.841
- OK.
- Mmm.

00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:07.683
Hmm.

00:37:09.427 --> 00:37:11.691
I'm so happy for you two!

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:15.096
So happy! So happy!

00:37:15.132 --> 00:37:16.997
Let's get the champagne!

00:37:17.935 --> 00:37:19.869
So here we are.

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:23.435
This is your bedroom.

00:37:24.675 --> 00:37:30.636
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

00:37:30.681 --> 00:37:32.478
And here's the bed.

00:37:32.516 --> 00:37:35.314
Wow! Exquisite bed. Exquisite.

00:37:35.353 --> 00:37:38.322
So... where is Andrew's room?

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:40.290
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

00:37:40.324 --> 00:37:43.191
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

00:37:43.227 --> 00:37:45.491
He'll sleep
in here with you.

00:37:45.529 --> 00:37:47.895
Oh, great, 'cause we love to snuggle.

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:49.866
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.130
Oh, my God. What is it?

00:37:52.169 --> 00:37:56.071
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

00:37:56.107 --> 00:37:57.699
Who is this?

00:37:57.742 --> 00:38:01.337
- That's Kevin. I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

00:38:01.379 --> 00:38:03.438
We just rescued him from the pound,

00:38:03.481 --> 00:38:05.472
and he's still in training. Sorry.

00:38:05.516 --> 00:38:07.484
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

00:38:07.518 --> 00:38:09.315
or the eagles will snatch him.

00:38:09.353 --> 00:38:11.218
No, don't you listen to her.

00:38:11.255 --> 00:38:13.052
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

00:38:13.090 --> 00:38:16.423
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:17.518
in here if you need them.

00:38:17.561 --> 00:38:19.392
And if you
get chilly tonight...

00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:21.091
...use this.

00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:22.861
It has special powers.

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.892
Oh, what kind of special powers?

00:38:25.936 --> 00:38:27.563
I call it the Baby Maker.

00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:29.698
OK, well. Then I guess we...

00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.264
...gonna be super careful with that one.

00:38:31.309 --> 00:38:33.436
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

00:38:33.477 --> 00:38:35.445
We'd better turn in.
It's been quite an evening.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.208
So good night, everybody.

00:38:37.248 --> 00:38:38.545
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:38:38.582 --> 00:38:41.574
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:44.781
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:38:47.458 --> 00:38:49.517
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.993
Thank you so much. Sweet dreams.

00:38:51.028 --> 00:38:52.723
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.835
So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

00:38:58.869 --> 00:39:02.168
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

00:39:02.206 --> 00:39:04.401
Stop complaining.

00:39:06.811 --> 00:39:09.939
Um... Don't look, OK?

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:12.077
OK.

00:39:13.317 --> 00:39:14.545
Are your eyes closed?

00:39:14.585 --> 00:39:15.882
Completely.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:19.287
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

00:39:27.932 --> 00:39:31.629
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

00:39:31.669 --> 00:39:35.127
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

00:39:35.172 --> 00:39:38.164
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:40.268
- Fine.
- Great.

00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:12.169
Well.

00:40:12.209 --> 00:40:13.471
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

00:40:13.511 --> 00:40:16.036
with the sun streaming in.

00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:23.910
Thank you.

00:40:45.176 --> 00:40:47.076
Andrew. Phone.

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:50.580
Andrew!

00:40:50.614 --> 00:40:53.014
Crap. Andrew, Andrew, phone.

00:40:53.050 --> 00:40:54.415
Andrew!

00:40:54.452 --> 00:40:56.386
Yeah... right.

00:41:00.024 --> 00:41:03.551
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:12.162
Hello. Hello? Hello.

00:41:12.203 --> 00:41:14.068
Frank! Frank, darling.

00:41:14.104 --> 00:41:15.162
Darling, Frank.

00:41:15.206 --> 00:41:17.504
Are you there? Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:20.999
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

00:41:21.045 --> 00:41:22.808
Oh, my God! Margaret!

00:41:22.847 --> 00:41:25.407
One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

00:41:25.449 --> 00:41:26.473
Frank, hold on. No, no, no, no.

00:41:27.651 --> 00:41:30.381
Frank. Frank, I'm sorry you feel

00:41:30.421 --> 00:41:33.083
I pressured you into doing Oprah, but...

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:36.581
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

00:41:36.627 --> 00:41:42.463
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? It's going to be fine.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.627
I can just call them and I can cancel.

00:41:49.273 --> 00:41:51.741
You are...
you are so right, Frank.

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:53.902
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

00:41:53.944 --> 00:41:55.605
Yeah... yes.

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.238
I love listening to you, Frank.

00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:00.842
Shh! Sit. Sit.

00:42:02.186 --> 00:42:03.312
No, not you, Frank.

00:42:03.354 --> 00:42:05.151
No, no.

00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.918
Frank, if I may get down to it, OK...

00:42:06.957 --> 00:42:10.484
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

00:42:10.528 --> 00:42:13.725
Because, Frank, for so many years...

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:17.222
...you have inspired me with your
beautiful words, and I feel that...

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:18.895
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

00:42:18.936 --> 00:42:21.837
I think it's time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

00:42:21.872 --> 00:42:23.396
They are just so rich

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:24.566
with... passion...

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:29.272
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

00:42:29.313 --> 00:42:31.008
Frank, I just, uh...

00:42:31.048 --> 00:42:32.640
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:35.174
Give me that dog!

00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:37.653
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

00:42:37.688 --> 00:42:38.712
Give me that dog!

00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:41.948
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:44.256
Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.820
Oh, oh! Oh, oh. OK! OK, gotcha.

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:48.695
Frank, Frank.

00:42:48.732 --> 00:42:49.926
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

00:42:49.967 --> 00:42:53.095
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:55.867
I don't want to sell you on anything,

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:57.703
but this is your legacy, this book.

00:42:57.741 --> 00:42:59.140
And I think it's up to you to

00:42:59.176 --> 00:43:00.200
present your legacy to the world.

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:03.441
And call me tomorrow with your decision.

00:43:03.480 --> 00:43:05.209
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:06.273
No! Wait!

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:09.679
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:11.244
Take the doggy. Look at the doggy.

00:43:11.288 --> 00:43:13.188
I need that phone. Take the dog.

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.690
Take the dog. I need that phone!

00:43:14.725 --> 00:43:18.024
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

00:43:18.062 --> 00:43:20.053
Look at this.

00:43:21.332 --> 00:43:24.062
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.800
Morning, guys. Have you seen... daah.

00:43:28.839 --> 00:43:31.967
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.033
Will you go get her, Andy?

00:43:33.077 --> 00:43:35.045
We have a whole day planned for her,

00:43:35.079 --> 00:43:37.013
and she needs to get ready.

00:43:37.047 --> 00:43:39.311
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

00:43:39.350 --> 00:43:40.977
Mmm.

00:43:43.554 --> 00:43:46.523
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

00:43:46.557 --> 00:43:49.185
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:52.218
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

00:43:52.262 --> 00:43:54.059
The eagle came
and tried to take the dog.

00:43:54.098 --> 00:43:57.556
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

00:43:57.601 --> 00:43:59.967
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:02.472
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.837
Relax, all right?

00:44:03.874 --> 00:44:06.934
We'll order another phone, same number.
We'll go into town tomorrow and get it.

00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:08.035
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:13.209
Oh, OK. All right. Well, you go then.

00:44:13.250 --> 00:44:15.081
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

00:44:15.119 --> 00:44:16.552
You're going out with Mom and the girls.

00:44:16.587 --> 00:44:19.249
- I don't want to go out.
- Shopping, sightseeing. And a surprise.

00:44:19.289 --> 00:44:20.756
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

00:44:20.791 --> 00:44:22.258
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

00:44:22.292 --> 00:44:23.554
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:25.221
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.729
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:27.890
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

00:44:27.931 --> 00:44:29.728
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.496
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:33.298
There we go.

00:44:33.337 --> 00:44:36.033
Yeah, that's nice.

00:44:36.073 --> 00:44:38.769
Yeah. That's nice.

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:41.369
There we go. Isn't that nice?

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:42.936
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.447
- Mmm. Yeah.
- Boop boop boop.

00:44:44.481 --> 00:44:46.745
If you touch my ass one more time,

00:44:46.784 --> 00:44:48.945
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

00:44:48.986 --> 00:44:50.817
- Yeah.
- There you go.

00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:53.516
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

00:44:53.557 --> 00:44:55.923
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fianc�.

00:44:55.959 --> 00:44:57.756
Hmm. Ow.

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:14.439
<i>- Jeez.
- You want to see me?</i>

00:45:14.478 --> 00:45:17.174
Your mom found these eco-balls.

00:45:17.214 --> 00:45:19.079
They dissolve in water.

00:45:20.718 --> 00:45:23.448
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:27.446
Anyway, she, uh... is a little peeved.

00:45:27.491 --> 00:45:31.484
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

00:45:31.528 --> 00:45:32.825
It was a little bit of a shock

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:34.421
to find out that
you're getting married...

00:45:34.465 --> 00:45:37.696
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

00:45:37.735 --> 00:45:42.536
The point is... I owe you an apology.

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:46.335
Accepted.

00:45:46.376 --> 00:45:49.106
There's something else.

00:45:49.146 --> 00:45:52.980
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

00:45:53.016 --> 00:45:54.540
and it got me thinking.

00:45:56.253 --> 00:45:57.777
I've done a lot of things in my life.

00:45:57.821 --> 00:46:01.518
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

00:46:01.558 --> 00:46:02.718
It doesn't mean anything unless...

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.159
Unless you have someone to leave it to.

00:46:04.194 --> 00:46:07.630
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

00:46:07.664 --> 00:46:11.600
You have responsibilities here.

00:46:11.635 --> 00:46:13.398
I think I've been
more than understanding

00:46:13.437 --> 00:46:14.836
about your goofing off in New York.

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.533
I need you to quit playing around...

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:17.631
Here we go again.

00:46:17.674 --> 00:46:19.972
When are you going to start
taking what I do seriously?

00:46:20.010 --> 00:46:21.875
When you start acting seriously.

00:46:21.912 --> 00:46:24.380
I'm sorry.

00:46:24.414 --> 00:46:26.382
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

00:46:26.416 --> 00:46:28.941
I wish you had another son. I really do.

00:46:28.986 --> 00:46:30.146
One who wanted to stay here.

00:46:30.187 --> 00:46:31.950
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:34.048
One who wanted to marry someone
that you approve of,

00:46:34.091 --> 00:46:37.424
but it's not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

00:46:37.461 --> 00:46:42.398
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

00:46:42.432 --> 00:46:45.026
But it makes me happy. You understand?

00:46:48.205 --> 00:46:51.663
If that's what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:53.733
Well, that's a first.

00:46:53.777 --> 00:46:58.476
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

00:47:12.796 --> 00:47:14.286
There is no way you
could leave her at home.

00:47:14.331 --> 00:47:16.094
She had to be here. Absolutely.

00:47:16.133 --> 00:47:18.158
She's been coming here forever.

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:20.966
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

00:47:21.004 --> 00:47:24.303
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

00:47:24.341 --> 00:47:26.605
- Right?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

00:47:28.478 --> 00:47:29.945
OK, this is the big surprise

00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.381
I was telling you about. You ready?

00:47:34.818 --> 00:47:37.548
Oh, Margaret,
you're gonna love it!

00:48:07.885 --> 00:48:10.183
Ramone's the only
exotic dancer on the island.

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.450
But we're lucky to have him.

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:22.789
Work it, Ramone!

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:28.236
- Wow.
- Over here, Ramone! Over here.

00:48:28.272 --> 00:48:29.739
Over here, honey.

00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:33.406
Show her what
she's gonna be missing.

00:48:33.443 --> 00:48:34.774
Come, my sexy princess.

00:48:34.811 --> 00:48:36.506
- Yeah!
- Oh, no. Not necessary.

00:48:36.546 --> 00:48:39.413
It's a really nice gesture,
but I really need to just...

00:48:39.449 --> 00:48:40.677
Go on, Margaret. Get up there!

00:48:40.717 --> 00:48:41.775
You come dance.

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:43.308
OK, pluck my eyes out. OK.

00:48:43.353 --> 00:48:46.982
All right. Here we go.

00:48:47.024 --> 00:48:49.083
Go, Margaret! Go, Margaret!

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:52.254
Hey.

00:48:52.296 --> 00:48:53.320
Hey... oh.

00:48:53.363 --> 00:48:55.695
Give it to her, Ramone!

00:48:59.937 --> 00:49:02.371
Go on, Ramone! Give it to her!

00:49:14.785 --> 00:49:17.049
Ooh, that's a move I haven't seen.

00:49:19.189 --> 00:49:22.454
Look at her face!

00:49:22.492 --> 00:49:26.690
Guess who.
For you. For you. For you.

00:49:26.730 --> 00:49:29.631
- Yeah!
- Enjoy!

00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:37.806
I don't want to touch it.
No. OK, OK. Very sweet.

00:49:37.841 --> 00:49:38.967
No, no, no, no, no.

00:49:41.345 --> 00:49:42.437
Smack him!

00:49:42.479 --> 00:49:44.879
- I'm sorry?
- Smack his ass.

00:49:44.915 --> 00:49:46.883
Smack it. OK.

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:52.555
- Smack him, Margaret!
- Give it to him!

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:56.116
Yeah! Woo!

00:49:56.159 --> 00:49:57.956
Can I get down now?

00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:11.106
Free. Be free.

00:50:18.782 --> 00:50:21.512
Hey! There you are.
How are you holding up?

00:50:21.551 --> 00:50:25.681
Oh, fine. Fine. Just working on my tan.

00:50:25.722 --> 00:50:28.714
Yeah, the Paxtons can be
a bit overwhelming at times.

00:50:28.759 --> 00:50:29.885
Yes, yes.

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:33.121
It's a little different
than New York, huh?

00:50:33.163 --> 00:50:36.621
Little bit. Little bit. You ever been?

00:50:36.666 --> 00:50:39.658
No. That was always
Andrew's dream, not mine.

00:50:39.703 --> 00:50:42.069
You guys were pretty serious, huh?

00:50:42.105 --> 00:50:44.835
Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

00:50:44.875 --> 00:50:46.968
but we were kids.

00:50:48.779 --> 00:50:51.270
And you guys called it off because of...

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.682
Well, um...

00:50:55.719 --> 00:51:00.383
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

00:51:00.424 --> 00:51:01.948
...and said he wanted to elope

00:51:01.992 --> 00:51:04.756
and run away to New York with me.

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:07.355
And...

00:51:07.397 --> 00:51:09.262
You said "no. "

00:51:09.299 --> 00:51:12.234
And I said "no," yeah.

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:16.205
I've never been anywhere
but here. This is home.

00:51:16.239 --> 00:51:21.040
But anyway... you're a lucky girl.

00:51:21.078 --> 00:51:26.311
He really is the best, which
you obviously already know.

00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:31.116
Oh, yep. Yep, very much so, yeah.

00:51:31.154 --> 00:51:34.351
Well, cheers to you guys.

00:51:35.358 --> 00:51:39.317
Oh... Thank you.

00:51:44.034 --> 00:51:46.901
Looks like Ramone's
wrappin' it up.

00:51:47.838 --> 00:51:51.774
Go, Annie!

00:51:51.808 --> 00:51:53.867
I've never seen him so...

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.969
- No, he really got down.
... out there. I mean...

00:51:56.012 --> 00:52:00.210
He was wonderful.

00:52:00.717 --> 00:52:01.979
Oh, no.

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.622
Andrew!

00:52:09.659 --> 00:52:11.923
Andrew, honey, is everything OK?

00:52:15.432 --> 00:52:17.263
What... What's he doing?

00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:19.768
Something's up. It's best
to leave him alone.

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:21.065
Come on, honey.

00:52:25.175 --> 00:52:27.200
<i>...Hunt's version
of that here tonight.</i>

00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:29.940
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing? I'm watching that.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.311
Why is Andrew out there

00:52:31.348 --> 00:52:33.748
hollowing out that old
stupid canoe again?

00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:36.217
Well, maybe he's
planning to escape. What?

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:38.050
I am so tired.

00:52:38.088 --> 00:52:39.919
Think I'm gonna go
upstairs, take a shower,

00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:42.151
wash off Ramone's coconut body oil.

00:52:42.192 --> 00:52:43.557
Sure.

00:52:43.593 --> 00:52:45.925
I had a great day today. Thank you.

00:52:48.198 --> 00:52:49.222
What did you do?

00:52:49.266 --> 00:52:51.496
I didn't do anything, I mean...

00:52:51.535 --> 00:52:55.494
I just had a frank conversation
with him about his future.

00:52:55.539 --> 00:52:58.167
Oh... Well, yeah.
That's a good idea.

00:52:58.208 --> 00:52:59.675
That's a good idea, Joe,

00:52:59.709 --> 00:53:01.939
because he will never
come back home now.

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:05.573
He is my son. I only get
to see him every three years

00:53:05.615 --> 00:53:08.049
because of you. Because of you.

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.142
I've had enough.

00:53:09.186 --> 00:53:11.654
- You are gonna be supportive...
- Shh!

00:53:11.688 --> 00:53:12.814
...of him marrying
Margaret, and that is that.

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:15.654
Shh! Shh! Shh!

00:53:15.692 --> 00:53:17.250
You know, if we're not careful,

00:53:17.294 --> 00:53:20.195
we are gonna end up in
this great big house...

00:53:20.230 --> 00:53:22.357
...just you and me alone...

00:53:22.399 --> 00:53:24.128
...you and me and everything
that we're angry about,

00:53:24.167 --> 00:53:27.466
and God forbid that they
should have a grandchild

00:53:27.504 --> 00:53:29.199
that we never get to see.

00:53:29.239 --> 00:53:33.300
You are going to fix this,
Joe. I mean it. Fix it now.

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:45.883
Where's a towel?

00:53:51.561 --> 00:53:53.051
Towel...

00:53:55.065 --> 00:53:58.228
Towel, towel, towel... towel, towel.

00:53:58.268 --> 00:54:00.099
This is all they have for a towel?

00:54:00.136 --> 00:54:02.627
It's ridiculous. I can't get dry.

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:06.700
Hello.

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:09.503
Hello?

00:54:15.385 --> 00:54:16.716
Oh!

00:54:18.989 --> 00:54:20.513
Oh! Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

00:54:20.557 --> 00:54:21.581
No, no, no, no, no.

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.388
J- j-just... I'm sorry.

00:54:23.426 --> 00:54:25.587
L- I-let me just,
let me just get a towel.

00:54:25.629 --> 00:54:27.062
Let me just get a towel.

00:54:27.097 --> 00:54:29.031
Just... look.

00:54:29.065 --> 00:54:30.726
You need to just... I'm sorry.

00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:32.257
OK, I'm sorry for
feeding you to the eagle.

00:54:32.302 --> 00:54:33.769
I'm sorry.

00:54:38.408 --> 00:54:39.568
Go away. Go away.

00:54:39.609 --> 00:54:41.873
Go, go. Just let me get a towel.

00:54:41.911 --> 00:54:44.971
Go, go, go... Hold on.

00:54:51.321 --> 00:54:53.016
Yeah. Huh?

00:54:53.056 --> 00:54:56.082
How you like that? Huh?

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:58.060
Take it, take it. That's right.

00:54:58.094 --> 00:55:00.722
That's what I'm talking
about. You like that?

00:55:02.832 --> 00:55:05.562
Oh. You like it.

00:55:10.507 --> 00:55:13.476
Come here. Come to Mama.

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.569
That's right. Get on the carpet.

00:55:15.612 --> 00:55:17.603
That's a good boy.

00:55:17.647 --> 00:55:21.913
Yes! That's good, boy! Come on.

00:55:21.951 --> 00:55:23.612
Come on!

00:55:23.653 --> 00:55:25.177
Oh, oh!

00:55:28.758 --> 00:55:32.250
- Oh, oh!
- What the?

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:34.820
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

00:55:34.864 --> 00:55:37.264
- Why are you naked? My God!
- Oh, God. Why are you wet?

00:55:37.300 --> 00:55:39.894
- Don't look at me.
- I don't understand.

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.426
- Why are you wet?
- Why are you naked?

00:55:41.471 --> 00:55:43.132
Don't look at me.

00:55:43.173 --> 00:55:45.767
Oh, God! You're showing everything.

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:47.800
Cover it up, for the love of God!

00:55:47.844 --> 00:55:52.110
Oh, God, not the Baby Maker.

00:55:52.148 --> 00:55:53.672
Explain yourself please.

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:55.947
- Explain myself?
- Yes, explain yourself.

00:55:55.985 --> 00:55:57.145
- I was outside.
- Oh, really?

00:55:57.187 --> 00:55:59.451
- You didn't hear me?
- I was listening to...

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:00.683
What are you even doing home?

00:56:00.724 --> 00:56:02.851
Then you just, jump me
out of nowhere? What's that?

00:56:02.892 --> 00:56:04.621
I di... I didn't mean to jump you.

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:08.961
Your dog was attacking me, and I
had to run, and I ran into you.

00:56:08.998 --> 00:56:10.625
What is it with you and this dog?

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:12.658
Just, you know, just... go.

00:56:12.702 --> 00:56:13.999
- Go...
- Fine.

00:56:14.037 --> 00:56:15.629
- Go take a shower. You stink.
- Fine.

00:56:15.672 --> 00:56:17.503
- Nice tattoo, by the way.
- What?

00:56:19.642 --> 00:56:22.042
See? See? Exactly. You see that?

00:56:22.078 --> 00:56:24.672
Oh... barely made it out
with my life there.

00:56:24.714 --> 00:56:26.648
<i>See the size of the teeth on that thing?</i>

00:56:26.683 --> 00:56:28.082
I didn't...

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:47.795
So... So naked.

00:56:49.339 --> 00:56:51.739
Can we, uh, not talk about that, please?

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.433
Just sayin'.

00:56:59.315 --> 00:57:01.875
So, uh, what's the deal
with you and your father?

00:57:01.918 --> 00:57:06.548
Ooh, I'm sorry. That question
is not in the binder.

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:08.955
Oh, really? Well, I thought
you were the one that said

00:57:08.992 --> 00:57:10.323
we needed to learn all this...

00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:11.918
Not about that, I didn't.

00:57:11.961 --> 00:57:13.861
- But if the guy asks us...
- Not about that, Margaret.

00:57:13.897 --> 00:57:15.728
Good night.

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:35.150
- I like the Psychic Network.
- What?

00:57:35.185 --> 00:57:37.949
Not in the "ha-ha, isn't that
funny, she likes that trash"

00:57:37.987 --> 00:57:41.047
kind of way. I actually quite enjoy it.

00:57:41.090 --> 00:57:42.648
Umm...

00:57:45.795 --> 00:57:48.730
I took disco lessons in the sixth grade.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:54.927
My first concert was
Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock.

00:57:57.173 --> 00:57:59.437
I think Brian Dennehy is sexy.

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:02.174
Don't like flowers in the house,

00:58:02.212 --> 00:58:05.511
'cause they remind me of funerals.

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:07.072
Never played a video game.

00:58:08.184 --> 00:58:11.119
<i>I read Wuthering Heights
every Christmas.</i>

00:58:11.154 --> 00:58:13.520
It's my favorite book.

00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:20.786
Haven't slept with a man
in over a year and a half.

00:58:22.765 --> 00:58:25.359
And, uh... I went to
the bathroom and cried

00:58:25.401 --> 00:58:28.427
after Bob called me a poisonous bitch.

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:32.906
And the, uh, bird tattoo?

00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:34.341
They're swallows.

00:58:36.913 --> 00:58:40.974
Got them when I was 16...
after my parents died.

00:58:43.419 --> 00:58:46.445
Stupid.

00:58:46.489 --> 00:58:48.582
I'm sure there's many many other things,

00:58:48.625 --> 00:58:51.093
but that's all I can
come up with right now.

00:58:58.234 --> 00:58:59.701
You, uh, there?

00:59:02.705 --> 00:59:03.967
I'm here.

00:59:06.643 --> 00:59:08.406
Just processing.

00:59:15.118 --> 00:59:17.416
You really haven't slept
with anyone in 18 months?

00:59:17.453 --> 00:59:19.944
Oh, my God. Out of all that,
that's all you got?

00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:21.456
That's a long time.

00:59:21.491 --> 00:59:23.789
Yeah, well, I've been a little busy.

00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:25.953
Yeah...

00:59:28.498 --> 00:59:30.398
Who's, uh...

00:59:30.433 --> 00:59:33.561
- Rob Base and D. J...
- E-Z Rock?

00:59:33.603 --> 00:59:35.366
- Yeah.
- You know.

00:59:42.211 --> 00:59:44.076
- No. They were good.
- Mm-mm.

00:59:47.784 --> 00:59:51.914
- What?
- Nothing.

00:59:51.955 --> 00:59:55.482
I know who they are. I just
wanted to hear you sing it.

01:00:03.633 --> 01:00:06.500
- Margaret?
- Yes?

01:00:08.371 --> 01:00:10.839
Don't take this the wrong way.

01:00:12.475 --> 01:00:15.239
'K.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:20.306
You are a very... very beautiful woman.

01:00:45.842 --> 01:00:47.810
- Feel it deep, feel it low.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:52.208
God, I can't sing that high.

01:01:15.872 --> 01:01:17.499
Huh? Where am I?

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.740
What time is it?

01:01:20.777 --> 01:01:22.335
What time is it?

01:01:22.378 --> 01:01:26.007
Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.288
Oh, God.

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:06.318
Room service.
Breakfast for the happy couple.

01:02:06.355 --> 01:02:08.880
Andrew! Andrew!

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:11.860
Andr...

01:02:11.894 --> 01:02:13.361
Your mother's at the door. Get up!

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:14.761
- Get up here! Your mother's...
- Oh, God.

01:02:14.797 --> 01:02:16.389
Just a second!

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.068
- Not the baby blanket.
- OK, all right.

01:02:23.106 --> 01:02:25.836
Not the baby blanket. Get it
off, get it off, get it off.

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.809
- OK, all right.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

01:02:27.844 --> 01:02:29.812
- What? What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

01:02:29.846 --> 01:02:31.575
What? No. Of course not.

01:02:31.614 --> 01:02:34.674
- OK, what do we do? All right.
- Just spoon me, spoon me...

01:02:34.717 --> 01:02:37.481
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- I'm sorry. It's morning.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.488
What do you mean, "It's morning"?

01:02:39.522 --> 01:02:41.183
Are you OK?

01:02:41.224 --> 01:02:44.057
Yep! Coming. One second. Yep.
Come on in. Everything's fine.

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.584
Disgusting.

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:48.426
Ow, you're on my hair. OK, just...

01:02:53.703 --> 01:02:57.002
- Oh, wow.
- Ooh, smells good.

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.438
Cinnamon rolls.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.567
Oh, you shouldn't have
gone to that trouble.

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:03.579
Oh, you're family now. It's no trouble.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:06.013
Hey, you have room for one more?

01:03:06.048 --> 01:03:10.178
Wow. Could we not do the
Brady family meeting right now?

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:11.243
We just got up...

01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:12.686
- Yeah.
... if you don't mind.

01:03:12.722 --> 01:03:14.781
Your mother and I have
come up with a proposition

01:03:14.824 --> 01:03:18.021
and I happen to think
it's a terrific idea...

01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.324
We want you
to get married here tomorrow.

01:03:20.363 --> 01:03:21.489
Tomorrow.

01:03:23.399 --> 01:03:25.526
- What? What? What?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.229
Well, you're gonna get married anyway,

01:03:27.270 --> 01:03:29.670
so why don't you get married here...

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.104
...where we can be all together,

01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:34.439
and that way Grandma Annie
can be a part of it.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:36.638
- Oh. Oh, we're...
- No.

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:40.012
No. No, it's Gammy's
big birthday tomorrow night.

01:03:40.049 --> 01:03:41.141
Big day for her.

01:03:41.184 --> 01:03:43.277
We don't want to ruin it.
That's you know...

01:03:43.319 --> 01:03:47.050
I've had 89 birthday parties,
I don't need another one.

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:48.488
Oh, Gammy.

01:03:48.524 --> 01:03:50.992
It would be a dream come true for me

01:03:51.027 --> 01:03:53.393
to see my one grandchild's wedding.

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.693
- A dream come true!
- Mmmm.

01:03:55.731 --> 01:03:58.928
- So you'll do it?
- Mmm-mmm.

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:00.629
Before I'm dead?

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.069
- OK. OK.
- OK.

01:04:04.373 --> 01:04:06.637
OK, we will do everything.

01:04:06.676 --> 01:04:09.236
And you can get married
like we did, in the barn.

01:04:09.278 --> 01:04:11.405
It's a Paxton family tradition.

01:04:11.447 --> 01:04:14.143
- Oh, wow!
- Yup.

01:04:14.183 --> 01:04:19.485
Wow! Uh! I've always wanted to
get married in a... in a barn.

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:21.854
- I have.
- It's a sign.

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:25.657
A sign from the universe that
you're meant to be together.

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:28.858
Oh, we must give thanks, I tell you.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:32.026
Come, come. We must give thanks.

01:04:32.068 --> 01:04:34.696
OK, I know I should leave you alone now.

01:04:34.737 --> 01:04:38.195
But we're just so excited!
I know you're excited, too.

01:04:38.241 --> 01:04:40.141
<i>- It's the craziest.
- Really excited.</i>

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:43.577
Yeah! Go. Go.

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:44.705
Go.

01:04:49.151 --> 01:04:52.484
Oh, my God.

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:54.421
When my mom finds out that
this whole thing is a sham

01:04:54.457 --> 01:04:55.788
she's gonna... she's gonna be crushed,

01:04:55.825 --> 01:04:58.020
and my grandmother's gonna die.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:04:59.687
- Your mom's not going to find out.
- I... my father.

01:04:59.729 --> 01:05:01.287
What the hell's with that?
The whole wedding thing?

01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:02.354
Where did that come from?

01:05:02.398 --> 01:05:04.628
She probably got him worked up into it.

01:05:04.667 --> 01:05:05.895
It's fine. She's not gonna find out.

01:05:05.935 --> 01:05:08.062
- They're not going to find out.
- Oh, God. Margaret!

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:11.562
Andrew, they're not gonna
find out, OK? Just relax.

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:13.165
It's gonna be OK.

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:15.700
It's not like we're
gonna be married forever.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.339
We'll be happily divorced
before you know it.

01:05:18.381 --> 01:05:22.784
It will be fine. It will be fine.

01:05:22.818 --> 01:05:24.376
You OK?

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.047
Yeah.

01:05:30.092 --> 01:05:33.118
- Get us some coffee.
- Yeah.

01:05:33.162 --> 01:05:36.859
So, would you like a cinnamon soy latte?

01:05:36.899 --> 01:05:38.628
A- ha.

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:44.830
You're right, you know...

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.171
Get a quickie divorce, we'll be fine.

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.835
- Absolutely.
- It's gonna be fine.

01:05:47.877 --> 01:05:50.243
Everything is going to be great.

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:52.179
But this little missus
better learn how to cook...

01:05:52.214 --> 01:05:54.045
...so she can take care of her husband.

01:05:54.083 --> 01:05:55.209
Keep my man happy.

01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:56.980
I don't want him leaving
me for another woman.

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.111
Come on...

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:00.918
...haven't left you yet, Margaret.

01:06:00.957 --> 01:06:03.824
I got it. Let go.

01:06:05.728 --> 01:06:08.162
- You all right?
- Yeah, um...

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:09.687
You know what? I'm gonna go.

01:06:09.732 --> 01:06:11.029
Where?

01:06:11.067 --> 01:06:13.968
I just kinda feel like going outside.

01:06:14.003 --> 01:06:16.528
All right. That's the bathroom.

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:17.971
Oh, yeah. I know. I'm just, uh...

01:06:18.007 --> 01:06:21.204
I'm gonna go to go to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna go out, outside.

01:06:21.243 --> 01:06:22.267
All right.

01:06:23.379 --> 01:06:24.846
All right.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:40.694
OK, you just have to focus,
Margaret. Just focus.

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:43.494
This is a business deal.
This is just a business deal.

01:06:43.532 --> 01:06:48.299
Everything's
gonna be just fine.

01:06:49.605 --> 01:06:53.507
OK, this is a little
rough. I can do this.

01:06:54.977 --> 01:06:57.445
Oh, my God. God, I hate nature!

01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:58.811
I hate it.

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:02.249
Not stopping. Not stopping. Oh! Oh...

01:07:02.284 --> 01:07:04.252
Why are you not stopping?

01:07:04.286 --> 01:07:06.720
Stop, stop, stop it, stop!

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.453
I just wanted... some air.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.291
What is that?

01:07:20.336 --> 01:07:25.000
What now? What is that? What is that?

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:27.475
What is that?

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:42.350
What is that?

01:07:58.707 --> 01:08:01.904
Come to me,
Margaret of New York.

01:08:01.944 --> 01:08:04.412
It is I, Grandma Annie.

01:08:04.447 --> 01:08:05.812
Oh!

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:08.339
I see you are a curious one.

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:11.376
Come. See how I give
thanks to Mother Earth.

01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.820
You know, actually,
I'm not that curious.

01:08:13.856 --> 01:08:15.721
- I'll just...
- Look around you.

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:18.283
Mother Earth has provided all this...

01:08:18.327 --> 01:08:22.764
...just as she brought you and
Andrew together to be joined.

01:08:22.798 --> 01:08:25.426
- Oh.
- We must give thanks

01:08:25.468 --> 01:08:28.665
and ask that your loins
be abundantly fertile.

01:08:28.704 --> 01:08:32.162
Come. Dance with me in celebration.

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:35.541
You know, can I, can I
just thank her from here?

01:08:35.578 --> 01:08:37.443
I insist!

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.778
OK, OK, OK.

01:08:39.815 --> 01:08:42.579
I will come down and dance with you.

01:08:44.420 --> 01:08:47.583
Follow and learn.

01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:55.557
Come on, Margaret! Feel the
rhythm of the drums. Now you.

01:08:55.598 --> 01:08:57.122
- Me what?
- Chant.

01:08:57.166 --> 01:08:58.724
Chant what?

01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:00.894
Whatever comes
to you. It is the way.

01:09:00.936 --> 01:09:04.702
- But I don't know any chants.
- To the trees. Use your vowels.

01:09:04.740 --> 01:09:08.506
- Eee. Ooo. Ooo. Eee.
- Ooo. Eee.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:10.307
- Yes. Chant.
- Yes. Chant, chant.

01:09:10.346 --> 01:09:12.473
- Eee. To the trees.
- Yes! Yes!

01:09:12.515 --> 01:09:16.542
- To the universe!
- The universe. Ah. Universe.

01:09:16.585 --> 01:09:20.351
<i>To the crazy.
To the window, the window.</i>

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:22.050
To the wall, to the wall.

01:09:22.091 --> 01:09:23.786
To the sweat drip down my balls.

01:09:23.826 --> 01:09:26.260
- To all you bitches...
- Louder!

01:09:26.295 --> 01:09:28.229
To the window, to the window.

01:09:28.264 --> 01:09:29.993
To the walls, to the walls.

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.624
To the sweat drip down my balls.

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:33.931
Now all you bitches crawl.

01:09:33.969 --> 01:09:35.630
<i># All skeet, skeet, mother</i>

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.263

Gammy! Let's take it
to the bridge! Woo!

01:10:01.697 --> 01:10:03.858
<i># Let me see you get low

Oh, uh.

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:26.551
Uh... You know,
your Gammy wanted me to...

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:28.489
...you know, chant.
Chant from the heart.

01:10:28.524 --> 01:10:31.015
Balls? That's what came to your heart?

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:34.791
You know, it went with the beat.

01:10:34.830 --> 01:10:36.593
Your phone arrived.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:38.190
I'm gonna go into town
to pick it up. Wanna come?

01:10:38.234 --> 01:10:41.135
Oh, yes, I want to go.
I want to go. Oh, hold on.

01:10:41.170 --> 01:10:44.071
Is it, uh, OK if I go with him?

01:10:44.106 --> 01:10:46.734
Whatever you do is what shall be.

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:48.903
But you're OK if I go?

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:52.402
- Fine. Go on.
- Bye, Gammy.

01:10:52.448 --> 01:10:54.939
- You're a freak!
- Shut up.

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.452
Would you, please?

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.044
Ow!

01:11:17.239 --> 01:11:18.331
Hey, buddy.

01:11:18.374 --> 01:11:20.103
Andrew, hey!

01:11:20.142 --> 01:11:23.111
- You got that phone I ordered?
- Yes, it came in. How are you?

01:11:23.145 --> 01:11:25.045
- Great. You?
- Good.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.439
<i>Hola.</i>

01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:31.878
Hey, hi.

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:33.547
<i>Remember this?</i>

01:11:33.589 --> 01:11:34.681
Yes, yes.

01:11:34.723 --> 01:11:37.283
Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes.

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:40.295
- Remember that?
- Yes. Yes. I know.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:45.490
Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:47.900
Mmm-hmm, I think the part
where I burst into tears

01:11:47.936 --> 01:11:49.563
just really brought us together.

01:11:49.605 --> 01:11:51.072
- Yeah. Oh, guess what.
- What?

01:11:51.106 --> 01:11:52.539
Fun fact about Andrew number 11:

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:54.098
- I like Pringles.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:55.508
They're delicious. All Hostess products.

01:11:55.544 --> 01:11:57.205
Coke, never Pepsi, and beef jerky.

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.508
What, are you, like, 13?

01:11:58.547 --> 01:12:00.139
- Mmm.
- Here we go.

01:12:00.182 --> 01:12:01.410
It's all charged up, Andrew.

01:12:01.450 --> 01:12:02.474
Thanks, buddy.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.652
And I put your lady's number in, too.

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:08.179
- Thank you very mu...
- Milady.

01:12:11.527 --> 01:12:13.518
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you.

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:14.927
Just... thank you.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:21.762
Oh, my God. I have 37 messages.

01:12:22.771 --> 01:12:24.136
Shit. I need a computer.

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:26.004
Is there, is there a computer
in this godforsaken town?

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:32.842
OK. So when it runs out,
it gives you a warning.

01:12:32.881 --> 01:12:34.212
Just put in more dimes.

01:12:35.617 --> 01:12:37.448
- Here you go.
- What?

01:12:37.486 --> 01:12:39.420
- You're kidding. Dimes?
- Come on, Kels.

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:40.922
- You're not kidding?
- I'll be outside.

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.287
- Yell if you need me.
- But what am I supposed...

01:12:42.324 --> 01:12:43.985
You'll be fine.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:50.122
OK, I can figure this out.
I'm an intelligent woman.

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:52.599
Block 'em out, block 'em out,
block 'em out. There you go.

01:12:52.634 --> 01:12:54.329
OK.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.600
Now.

01:12:56.638 --> 01:12:58.128
What is that? What is it?

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:04.836
Um, uh, excuse me? Excuse...

01:13:08.550 --> 01:13:09.676
OK.

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.546
OK.

01:13:42.317 --> 01:13:44.979
So, it was nice
to see Gertrude, huh?

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.487
Yeah.

01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:48.717
She looked really pretty today.

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.990
- Yeah, she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:13:53.262 --> 01:13:56.254
Must be nice to see each other
again and just catch up.

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:58.425
It's definitely good to see her. It's...

01:13:58.467 --> 01:14:00.298
...definitely, yeah.
It's been a long time.

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.572
Oh, there they are.
There they are. Margaret!

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:05.937
Woo!

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.066
We need Margaret.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:09.669
Afraid we're going to have to
steal you away, young lady.

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:11.235
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna keep...

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.975
No, not to worry.

01:14:13.015 --> 01:14:15.347
No strippers, no chanting
in the woods. Promise.

01:14:15.384 --> 01:14:17.249
- Oh, well...
- Yeah. Come on.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:21.120
But not you. It's girl stuff.
You'd hate it.

01:14:21.156 --> 01:14:23.716
- But...
- Come on.

01:14:23.759 --> 01:14:25.351
Um, OK. Will I, uh...

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.624
...are these shoes OK
for what we're gonna do?

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:30.931
I can't believe this is happening.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.560
My mother made this dress by hand.

01:14:34.603 --> 01:14:38.369
In this very shop. In 1929.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:41.399
It's funny how things
come back in style.

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:43.434
Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.208
Yeah, and don't worry about the fit

01:14:45.247 --> 01:14:48.273
because Annie is the best
tailor in southeast Alaska.

01:14:48.317 --> 01:14:49.341
Oh... Pssh.

01:14:51.753 --> 01:14:53.277
Wow, incredible.

01:14:53.322 --> 01:14:55.882
Maybe a tad loose in certain
areas, but otherwise...

01:14:55.924 --> 01:14:59.655
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit
chesty to begin with

01:14:59.695 --> 01:15:02.391
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:03.762
Oh.

01:15:03.799 --> 01:15:07.098
Oh, let's see if we can find your boobs.

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:12.265
- They're in there somewhere.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

01:15:12.307 --> 01:15:14.138
This is like an Easter egg hunt.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:17.801
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:24.684
- Oh! There they are.
- That... yes. That would be...

01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:28.247
- There, let's see.
- I was thinking, if you'd like,

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:33.023
maybe we could head down your
way for the holidays this year.

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:35.256
Oh, that would, uh...
that would be nice.

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:39.791
That'd be nice. Or maybe
we could come to you, too.

01:15:39.835 --> 01:15:43.566
- Well, that would be lovely.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15:43.605 --> 01:15:45.766
I would like that very much.

01:15:45.807 --> 01:15:48.605
Oh, Grace, for God's sake.
We've got work to do.

01:15:48.644 --> 01:15:51.442
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Go make yourself a cup of tea.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.313
I'll finish this. Go.

01:15:54.349 --> 01:16:00.288
Now, let's make this
absolute perfection.

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:07.986
Now, just one special touch
and you're ready.

01:16:11.733 --> 01:16:16.534
It's been in the family
for more than 150 years.

01:16:16.572 --> 01:16:18.540
Annie, it's beautiful,
but I don't really think...

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:21.236
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:24.768
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

01:16:24.813 --> 01:16:26.974
when they got married.

01:16:27.015 --> 01:16:29.074
They were quite a scandal, you know.

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:33.076
He was Russian and she
was Tlingit, and back then

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:35.919
you had to get approval
from every member of the tribe

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.289
before you got married.

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:38.884
Almost broke them up.

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:41.862
Well... how did they stay together then?

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:44.593
She was a lot like you. Tough.

01:16:44.633 --> 01:16:47.568
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

01:16:47.603 --> 01:16:51.471
She was good for him.

01:16:51.506 --> 01:16:53.269
I want you to have it.

01:16:53.308 --> 01:16:56.800
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

01:16:56.845 --> 01:17:00.474
Grandmothers love to give
their stuff to their grandchildren.

01:17:00.515 --> 01:17:03.245
It makes us feel like we'll
still be part of your lives

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:04.684
even after we're gone.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.915
Take it.

01:17:12.227 --> 01:17:15.594
Are... are you all right, dear?

01:17:16.932 --> 01:17:19.594
I, uh...

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:24.071
Uh... Well, I, um...

01:17:26.241 --> 01:17:31.975
I, uh... I just, uh, I just wanted to...

01:17:32.014 --> 01:17:34.778
make sure there was enough time
to get all the sewing done.

01:17:34.816 --> 01:17:37.785
Don't you worry about that.

01:17:37.819 --> 01:17:40.287
- You're gonna be beautiful.
- OK.

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:43.917
- Now let's get you out of those pins.
- OK.

01:18:07.049 --> 01:18:08.175
All right.

01:18:13.255 --> 01:18:17.692
This is untied. Hop on in.

01:18:20.062 --> 01:18:22.462
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:24.564
Whoa! What...

01:18:24.599 --> 01:18:26.157
Mind telling me what the hell's wrong?

01:18:26.201 --> 01:18:27.896
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

01:18:27.936 --> 01:18:29.961
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop talking, please!

01:18:38.413 --> 01:18:41.974
Would you mind telling me
what's happening now?

01:18:42.017 --> 01:18:43.484
Margaret.

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.646
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

01:18:48.690 --> 01:18:49.884
You forgot what?

01:18:49.925 --> 01:18:52.485
I forgot what it was
like to have a family!

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.893
I've been on my own since I was 16

01:18:54.930 --> 01:18:57.865
and I forgot what it felt
like to have people love you

01:18:57.899 --> 01:19:00.163
and make you breakfast and say, "Hey!

01:19:00.202 --> 01:19:01.794
We'd love to come down
for the holidays. "

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:05.329
And I say, "Well, why don't we
come up and see you instead?"

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:07.864
And give you necklaces!
And you have all that here,

01:19:07.909 --> 01:19:10.571
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:12.842
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:13.939
You were there, remember?

01:19:13.982 --> 01:19:15.540
Your family loves you. Do you know that?

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.142
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

01:19:17.185 --> 01:19:18.846
And you're still willing
to put them through this?

01:19:18.887 --> 01:19:19.911
They're not gonna find out!

01:19:19.955 --> 01:19:21.252
How do you know they won't find out?

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:22.620
Because you said so yourself.

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:24.625
- I know, but what if your mother...
- You said so yourself!

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:25.853
Oh, my God, if your mother found out...

01:19:25.894 --> 01:19:27.919
Whoa! Whoa!

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:29.590
- Oh, my God! What if Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

01:19:29.631 --> 01:19:31.064
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

01:19:31.099 --> 01:19:33.033
Stop! It's gonna be fine!

01:19:33.068 --> 01:19:35.298
- She's gonna have a heart attack!
- Will you calm down! Hold on!

01:19:36.238 --> 01:19:37.762
Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:41.435
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

01:19:41.476 --> 01:19:45.071
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

01:19:45.113 --> 01:19:46.478
Now... Oh, great.

01:19:46.515 --> 01:19:48.847
Now you decide to shut up! Margaret?

01:19:48.884 --> 01:19:50.943
- Andrew!
- Margaret?

01:19:50.986 --> 01:19:53.648
- Andrew!
- Margaret!

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:58.517
I can't swim!

01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:00.084
Margaret!

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:01.390
To the buoy!

01:20:01.429 --> 01:20:03.897
- What?
- To the buoy!

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:05.824
OK.

01:20:19.114 --> 01:20:21.480
All right, come on! Give me your hand!

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:23.984
Hey! Give me your hand!

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:26.715
Margaret! Give me...

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:28.279
Come on, give me your hand!

01:20:28.323 --> 01:20:29.813
Come on, come on. I got you. I got you.

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:32.349
I got you.

01:20:33.595 --> 01:20:35.995
Come on.

01:20:36.031 --> 01:20:37.862
What the hell
were you thinking?

01:20:37.899 --> 01:20:39.560
Could've gotten yourself killed.

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:43.002
You turned the boat and
made me fall in, you jackass.

01:20:43.038 --> 01:20:45.063
You let go of the steering wheel, Ahab.

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:47.734
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:51.075
All right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

01:20:51.112 --> 01:20:55.674
Come on. It's OK.

01:20:55.717 --> 01:20:56.877
That's OK.

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:01.516
It's OK.

01:21:33.588 --> 01:21:35.078
I want to talk to both of you.

01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:50.797
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:05.109
Told you I'd check up on you.

01:22:06.621 --> 01:22:07.849
What did you do?

01:22:07.889 --> 01:22:09.789
I got a phone call from
Mr. Gilbertson here,

01:22:09.824 --> 01:22:12.088
who told me that if you were lying,

01:22:12.127 --> 01:22:14.357
and he strongly believes that you are,

01:22:14.396 --> 01:22:15.920
he would send you to prison.

01:22:15.964 --> 01:22:18.057
So I flew him up here.

01:22:18.099 --> 01:22:20.124
- Dad.
- Luckily for you,

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:23.194
your father negotiated
a deal on your behalf.

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:26.469
Now, this offer's
gonna last for 20 seconds,

01:22:26.508 --> 01:22:28.237
so listen closely.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.368
You're gonna make a statement

01:22:29.411 --> 01:22:31.072
admitting this marriage is a sham...

01:22:31.112 --> 01:22:32.409
...or you're gonna go to prison.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:34.677
You tell the truth, you're off the hook,

01:22:34.716 --> 01:22:37.480
and she is going to go back to Canada.

01:22:42.891 --> 01:22:45.689
Ah, well. Take the deal.

01:22:45.727 --> 01:22:50.130
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

01:22:50.165 --> 01:22:51.962
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.661
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

01:22:53.702 --> 01:22:56.000
Six months ago we started
dating, we fell in love.

01:22:56.037 --> 01:22:57.902
I asked her to marry me, she said "yes. "

01:22:57.939 --> 01:23:00.134
I'll see you at the wedding.

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:12.411
Well, you know.

01:23:33.742 --> 01:23:37.701
So...

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:40.408
...you sure about this?

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:42.006
Not really.

01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:48.553
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:49.614
but I think that...

01:23:49.657 --> 01:23:50.851
You'd do the same for me.

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:52.519
Right?

01:23:53.928 --> 01:23:56.260
Hope everyone is decent.

01:23:56.297 --> 01:23:57.787
You need to come with me.

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:59.527
Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.228
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:03.032
It's tradition.

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:05.062
- Give your bride a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

01:24:05.106 --> 01:24:06.334
...use the Baby Maker.

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.103
You've got your whole
lives to be together.

01:24:08.143 --> 01:24:10.941
- OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.447
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:23.389
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

01:24:30.365 --> 01:24:31.730
See you in the morning?

01:24:32.801 --> 01:24:34.200
Yeah.

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.324
Hey, Gammy.

01:25:40.135 --> 01:25:41.898
- Thanks, Gammy.
- Oh.

01:26:51.573 --> 01:26:53.063
Everyone, please be seated.

01:26:59.047 --> 01:27:00.071
Ramone.

01:27:04.018 --> 01:27:08.751
We are gathered here
today to give thanks...

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:12.352
...and to celebrate...

01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:14.953
...one of life's greatest moments.

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:16.827
To give recognition

01:27:16.864 --> 01:27:21.631
to the beauty, honesty,
and unselfish ways

01:27:21.669 --> 01:27:24.467
of Andrew and Margaret's true love

01:27:24.505 --> 01:27:26.973
in front of family and friends.

01:27:27.008 --> 01:27:29.909
For it is their family and friends

01:27:29.944 --> 01:27:34.244
who taught Andrew and Margaret to love.

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:39.049
So it is only right that
family and friends are all...

01:27:42.557 --> 01:27:44.787
<i>Mi amor. Do you have a question?</i>

01:27:45.627 --> 01:27:47.595
Uh, no...

01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:49.119
Your hand is up.

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:55.726
Oh, it, it's, uh, not a question,

01:27:55.770 --> 01:27:58.034
but I do have something I need to say.

01:27:58.072 --> 01:28:02.008
- Margaret.
- Can it wait till after?

01:28:02.043 --> 01:28:06.571
Uh... No. No.

01:28:17.959 --> 01:28:21.861
- Hi there.
- Hi.

01:28:21.896 --> 01:28:24.057
Thank you all so much for coming out.

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:27.261
I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

01:28:27.302 --> 01:28:29.429
to make about the wedding.

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:32.769
- A confession, actually.
- What are you doing?

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:36.368
Uh... I'm a Canadian. Yes, Canadian.

01:28:36.411 --> 01:28:40.575
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.276
And because I didn't want to leave

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:44.547
this wonderful country of yours,

01:28:44.585 --> 01:28:47.520
I forced Andrew here to marry me.

01:28:47.555 --> 01:28:48.988
Margaret, stop it.

01:28:49.023 --> 01:28:52.891
See, Andrew has always had
this extraordinary work ethic.

01:28:54.362 --> 01:28:56.023
Something I think he learned from you.

01:28:57.332 --> 01:28:59.391
And for three years I
watched him work harder

01:28:59.434 --> 01:29:01.402
than anyone else at our company.

01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:04.701
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:07.936
...he would, he would do
just about anything.

01:29:11.512 --> 01:29:15.539
So I blackmailed him to
come up here and to lie to you.

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:20.711
All of you.

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:23.485
And I thought it would
be easy to watch him do it.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.184
But it wasn't.

01:29:30.064 --> 01:29:32.225
Turns out it's not easy
to ruin someone's life

01:29:32.266 --> 01:29:34.894
once you find out
how wonderful they are.

01:29:41.142 --> 01:29:43.167
You have a beautiful family.

01:29:45.012 --> 01:29:47.139
Don't let this
come between you.

01:29:50.184 --> 01:29:52.482
This was my fault.

01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:54.351
Margaret...

01:29:54.389 --> 01:29:56.289
Andrew, this was a business deal,

01:29:56.324 --> 01:30:00.351
and you held up your end,
but now the deal is off.

01:30:01.629 --> 01:30:02.926
I'm sorry.

01:30:04.832 --> 01:30:06.060
And, you, meet me at the dock.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:07.897
You're giving me a ride to the airport.

01:30:24.719 --> 01:30:27.210
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:28.847
Andrew, you lied to us.

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:30.289
Let me get my head on straight, OK?

01:30:30.324 --> 01:30:31.723
I'll explain everything later.

01:30:31.759 --> 01:30:34.091
I'm sorry.

01:31:11.499 --> 01:31:14.366
<i>You were right.
This book is special.</i>

01:31:14.402 --> 01:31:16.029
<i>I lied because I knew publishing meant</i>

01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:17.332
<i>I'd lose you as an assistant</i>

01:31:17.371 --> 01:31:19.601
<i>but... you have an extraordinary eye,</i>

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:22.666
<i>and I'll make sure we
buy this before I leave.</i>

01:31:22.710 --> 01:31:26.840
<i>Have an amazing life.
You deserve it. Margaret.</i>

01:31:29.083 --> 01:31:32.314
<i>Well, that was, uh... crazy.</i>

01:31:33.721 --> 01:31:36.155
You know, people are gonna be
talking about this forever.

01:31:38.059 --> 01:31:39.686
Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:41.395 --> 01:31:42.521
Are you OK?

01:31:43.764 --> 01:31:46.631
Yeah. No. Uh...

01:31:48.803 --> 01:31:52.671
I just feel... You know
what the problem is?

01:31:52.707 --> 01:31:55.904
The problem is that this woman...

01:31:55.943 --> 01:31:59.470
...is a gigantic pain in my ass.

01:31:59.514 --> 01:32:01.982
First there's the whole leaving
thing. I understand that.

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:04.814
It's a sham wedding.
It's kind of stressful.

01:32:04.852 --> 01:32:07.878
But then she goes ahead
and she leaves this note.

01:32:07.922 --> 01:32:09.787
Because she doesn't have the decency...

01:32:09.824 --> 01:32:11.951
the humanity to do it to my face.

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:17.090
Three years. Three years
I work with this... this terrorist.

01:32:17.131 --> 01:32:18.723
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

01:32:18.766 --> 01:32:20.631
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

01:32:20.668 --> 01:32:22.431
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:23.698
because we had a deal!

01:32:23.738 --> 01:32:27.936
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

01:32:27.975 --> 01:32:29.169
<i>She just makes me a little crazy.</i>

01:32:29.210 --> 01:32:32.646
Yeah. I can see that.

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:36.741
So you're just gonna let her go?

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:51.999
So, what now?

01:32:52.033 --> 01:32:55.002
Well... now that
you're leaving voluntarily,

01:32:55.036 --> 01:32:57.732
<i>it all becomes very civilized.</i>

01:32:57.772 --> 01:33:00.536
Once we land in New York,
you have 24 hours

01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:03.601
to head back to Canada.

01:33:10.985 --> 01:33:13.317
- Andrew, what's happening?
- I got to talk to her.

01:33:13.354 --> 01:33:14.582
- Why would you do that?
- Boys!

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:15.646
This has nothing to do with you.

01:33:15.690 --> 01:33:16.714
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:18.247
I'm not gonna let you do this.

01:33:18.292 --> 01:33:19.759
I'm not asking
your permission here.

01:33:19.794 --> 01:33:22.991
Annie! Joe! Joe!

01:33:23.030 --> 01:33:26.227
Annie! Joe!

01:33:26.267 --> 01:33:29.259
I think I'm having a heart attack.

01:33:29.303 --> 01:33:30.736
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:32.602
- Easy, easy.
- Get a doctor!

01:33:36.644 --> 01:33:37.736
I got it.

01:34:06.273 --> 01:34:08.002
Andrew.

01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:13.979
You two need to stop fighting.

01:34:14.015 --> 01:34:16.677
You'll never see eye to eye.

01:34:17.985 --> 01:34:21.614
But you're family.

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:29.896
Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.

01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:32.797
Even if... if you don't agree with him.

01:34:35.169 --> 01:34:36.534
I promise.

01:34:38.472 --> 01:34:40.906
Andrew.

01:34:40.941 --> 01:34:46.902
Promise me you'll work harder
to be a part of this family.

01:34:46.947 --> 01:34:48.972
I will.

01:34:51.619 --> 01:34:53.951
I will, Gammy.

01:34:53.988 --> 01:34:59.620
Well, then, the spirits can take me.

01:34:59.660 --> 01:35:01.423
Oh, Annie.

01:35:08.169 --> 01:35:09.830
Gammy?

01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:18.039
I guess they're not ready for me.

01:35:19.280 --> 01:35:21.111
I'm feeling much better, sonny.

01:35:21.148 --> 01:35:23.048
No need to take us
to the hospital.

01:35:23.084 --> 01:35:24.881
Take us to the airport, please.

01:35:24.919 --> 01:35:26.750
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

01:35:26.787 --> 01:35:28.220
Oh, come on!

01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:30.086
Well, it was the only
way I could get you two

01:35:30.124 --> 01:35:32.524
to shut up and get us to the airport!

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.619
<i>Ma'am, we're not authorized
to take you to the airport.</i>

01:35:34.662 --> 01:35:37.631
Larry Ferris, don't
make me call your mother.

01:35:37.665 --> 01:35:39.826
You got it.

01:35:41.402 --> 01:35:43.700
You scared the hell out of me.

01:35:48.809 --> 01:35:52.870
Yep. You should've
given up back in New York.

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:56.144
See, I'm like Eliot Ness.

01:35:56.183 --> 01:35:59.277
I always get my man.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.346
I'm that good.

01:36:02.389 --> 01:36:04.516
Flight 1601, as soon
as you're in position,

01:36:04.558 --> 01:36:05.855
you're cleared for takeoff.

01:36:05.893 --> 01:36:07.019
<i>Roger that, Chuck.</i>

01:36:15.069 --> 01:36:16.969
OK. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:36:23.177 --> 01:36:24.735
Tower. Talk to me.

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:26.872
<i>- Chuck! It's Drew Paxton.
- Hey, dude.</i>

01:36:26.914 --> 01:36:29.906
Hey, uh... I have a little
favor I need from you, buddy...

01:36:29.950 --> 01:36:32.009
Margaret's on that plane. I got
to talk to her. Can you stop it?

01:36:32.052 --> 01:36:33.349
<i>Oh, yeah!</i>

01:36:33.387 --> 01:36:35.150
I heard about your lady bailin'.

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:38.215
<i>- Drag-ola.
- Chuck! I need you</i>

01:36:38.259 --> 01:36:39.783
to stop the plane. Please.

01:36:39.827 --> 01:36:42.694
<i>I can't do that.</i>

01:36:42.730 --> 01:36:46.063
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Come on!

01:36:46.867 --> 01:36:48.266
Oh, no.

01:36:50.437 --> 01:36:52.132
No!

01:36:53.908 --> 01:36:55.808
- What's wrong?
- Margaret's on that plane.

01:36:55.843 --> 01:36:58.107
- And he didn't get to tell her.
- Tell her what?

01:36:58.145 --> 01:36:59.612
That he loves her.

01:36:59.647 --> 01:37:02.480
So she could tell him
that she loves him, too.

01:37:02.516 --> 01:37:03.676
OK, but how does he...

01:37:03.717 --> 01:37:05.082
If she didn't love him,
she wouldn't have left.

01:37:05.119 --> 01:37:06.609
Of course not.

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.178
Am I the only one not getting this?

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:12.090
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

01:37:12.126 --> 01:37:13.593
Oh! Oh. Look down.

01:37:13.627 --> 01:37:15.925
<i>Like... Oh, there you are!</i>

01:37:15.963 --> 01:37:18.090
<i>Sorry, man. There was
nothing I could do.</i>

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:21.761
Thanks, Chuck.

01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:29.105
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you felt about her.

01:37:34.315 --> 01:37:35.907
Honey, it's gonna be OK.

01:38:09.383 --> 01:38:10.850
Jordan?

01:38:29.169 --> 01:38:30.193
Jordan.

01:38:31.572 --> 01:38:33.039
Jordan!

01:38:33.073 --> 01:38:36.406
I need for you to send
the boxes in my office to...

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:38.035
...to this address, please.

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:42.412
This one right here.
This address right here. OK?

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:45.009
- Can you do that?
- Uh, yes. Sure.

01:38:45.052 --> 01:38:46.917
- Good, all right. Thank you.
- Miss Tate.

01:38:46.954 --> 01:38:50.151
Yes. What? What?

01:38:52.026 --> 01:38:55.393
Hey.

01:38:56.764 --> 01:38:59.392
Andrew.

01:39:03.203 --> 01:39:05.831
Why are, why are you panting?

01:39:05.873 --> 01:39:08.034
Because I've been running.

01:39:08.075 --> 01:39:10.908
- Really. From Alaska?
- I need to talk to you.

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:12.640
Yeah? Well, I don't have time to talk.

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:15.080
I need to catch a 5:45 to Toronto.

01:39:15.115 --> 01:39:16.810
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes to go out today.

01:39:16.850 --> 01:39:17.908
I want to make sure everything is...

01:39:17.952 --> 01:39:20.045
Margaret! Stop talking!

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:25.648
Gotta say something.

01:39:25.693 --> 01:39:27.388
- OK.
- This will just take a sec.

01:39:27.428 --> 01:39:29.328
Fine. What?

01:39:30.331 --> 01:39:35.064
Three days ago, I loathed you.

01:39:35.102 --> 01:39:37.297
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

01:39:37.338 --> 01:39:38.635
Or poisoned.

01:39:38.672 --> 01:39:42.267
- Oh, that's nice.
- I told you to stop talking.

01:39:42.309 --> 01:39:44.903
Then we had our little
adventure up in Alaska

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:47.311
and things started to change.

01:39:47.348 --> 01:39:50.010
Things changed when we kissed.

01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:53.920
And when you told me about your tattoo.

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:58.752
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

01:39:58.792 --> 01:40:00.157
Uh-huuuh.

01:40:00.194 --> 01:40:01.320
Naked?

01:40:01.362 --> 01:40:03.330
Well, I didn't see anything...

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:04.729
Yeah, you did.

01:40:04.765 --> 01:40:09.031
<i>But I didn't realize any of
this until I was standing alone.</i>

01:40:09.069 --> 01:40:12.869
In a barn... wife-less.

01:40:12.906 --> 01:40:15.534
Now, you can imagine my disappointment

01:40:15.576 --> 01:40:17.043
when it suddenly dawned on me

01:40:17.077 --> 01:40:21.377
that the woman I love is about
to be kicked out of the country.

01:40:23.984 --> 01:40:25.815
So, Margaret.

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:29.181
Marry me.

01:40:32.626 --> 01:40:35.117
Because I'd like to date you.

01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:50.674
Trust me. You don't really
want to be with me.

01:40:50.711 --> 01:40:52.440
Yes, I do.

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:57.073
See, the thing is, there is a reason why

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:59.711
I've been alone all this time.

01:40:59.753 --> 01:41:01.721
I'm comfortable that way.

01:41:01.755 --> 01:41:03.780
And I think it would
just be a lot easier

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:09.854
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just left.

01:41:11.732 --> 01:41:13.324
You're right.

01:41:18.839 --> 01:41:21.433
That would be easier.

01:41:37.224 --> 01:41:40.682
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

01:42:04.551 --> 01:42:07.486
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

01:42:07.521 --> 01:42:09.045
I'm gonna take that as a "yes. "

01:42:09.089 --> 01:42:11.114
Oh, OK.

01:42:25.639 --> 01:42:28.574
Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

01:42:36.683 --> 01:42:40.312
So, let me see
if I've got this right.

01:42:40.354 --> 01:42:42.788
You two are engaged again.

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:44.381
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:46.517
For real?

01:42:47.461 --> 01:42:48.621
- Yes.
- Yeah.

01:42:48.662 --> 01:42:49.720
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

01:42:49.763 --> 01:42:50.889
Because one wrong answer...

01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:54.128
I'm gonna take you down.

01:42:56.503 --> 01:42:59.199
- OK.
- OK.

01:43:00.841 --> 01:43:02.138
Let's do it.

01:43:11.585 --> 01:43:13.109
When did you
first start to date?

01:43:13.153 --> 01:43:15.018
Last week.

01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:18.286
- That going well?
- So far it's great. Thank you.

01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:19.815
What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

01:43:19.860 --> 01:43:21.418
Men's Speed Stick?

01:43:21.461 --> 01:43:24.760
What flavor? Musk? Alpine?

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:26.095
Was it love at first sight?

01:43:26.133 --> 01:43:28.260
No.

01:43:28.302 --> 01:43:32.136
I loved her from the beginning.

01:43:32.172 --> 01:43:33.434
What side of the
bed does Margaret sleep on?

01:43:33.473 --> 01:43:35.202
She sleeps on the left.

01:43:35.242 --> 01:43:36.675
What side of the bed do you sleep on?

01:43:38.712 --> 01:43:43.046
Look, are they soul mates? Eeeh.

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:45.711
Uh... Will they kill each other? No.

01:43:45.752 --> 01:43:46.878
Are you a good driver?

01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.514
Oh, excellent driver. Excellent.

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:55.693
Oh.

01:43:55.729 --> 01:43:58.721
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

01:43:58.765 --> 01:44:00.665
...more swarthy, darker.

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:03.329
We don't use the word
"Margaret" around Kevin.

01:44:03.370 --> 01:44:07.670
He still hasn't warmed up to her.

01:44:07.708 --> 01:44:11.434
Margaret.

01:44:11.478 --> 01:44:13.207
See? It's the damnedest thing.

01:44:13.247 --> 01:44:14.874
I have never farted in front of him.

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:17.315
Nor will I ever fart in front of him.

01:44:17.351 --> 01:44:19.876
She farts in her sleep.

01:44:19.920 --> 01:44:21.820
Would you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

01:44:21.855 --> 01:44:25.086
You can tell by the way
she drinks her soda pop

01:44:25.125 --> 01:44:27.491
that she's a good dancer.

01:44:27.527 --> 01:44:28.755
Uh-huh. How, how...

01:44:28.795 --> 01:44:33.232
How is the soda pop
relevant to the dancing?

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:34.928
I don't understand this.

01:44:34.968 --> 01:44:37.903
- I call him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

01:44:37.938 --> 01:44:39.599
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:41.835
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

01:44:41.875 --> 01:44:45.072
Sometimes I call him Rick.

01:44:45.112 --> 01:44:46.579
How do you spell "Ramone?"

01:44:46.613 --> 01:44:49.480
R- A-M-O-N-E.

01:44:49.516 --> 01:44:51.416
Could you do that
again in English, please?

01:44:51.451 --> 01:44:54.318
When you say, you know, the
position in the relationship...

01:44:54.354 --> 01:44:55.719
Top or bottom?

01:44:55.756 --> 01:44:58.725
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

01:44:58.759 --> 01:45:00.488
You took an oath
when you walked in this office.

01:45:00.527 --> 01:45:02.995
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:04.292
Laura should've
done that, but she didn't.

01:45:04.331 --> 01:45:06.196
- That's OK.
- Who's Laura?

01:45:06.233 --> 01:45:08.565
She's the girl behind you.
Don't look around.

01:45:08.602 --> 01:45:09.864
Which of
the following numbers

01:45:09.903 --> 01:45:12.701
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

01:45:12.739 --> 01:45:14.900
I'm sorry. Let me say the list, please.

01:45:14.941 --> 01:45:15.965
I'm sorry?

01:45:16.009 --> 01:45:17.271
He knew
your favorite color.

01:45:17.311 --> 01:45:18.938
- Blue?
- Wrong!

01:45:18.979 --> 01:45:20.503
- Red?
- No!

01:45:20.547 --> 01:45:22.071
Dark... Maybe like a hunter green?

01:45:22.115 --> 01:45:23.514
No. White.

01:45:23.550 --> 01:45:24.812
- White?
- OK, moving on.

01:45:24.851 --> 01:45:26.250
Favorite color is blue.

01:45:26.286 --> 01:45:30.188
What's her favorite color
when she's not at home?

01:45:30.223 --> 01:45:31.622
I don't know.

01:45:31.658 --> 01:45:33.421
<i>Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?</i>

01:45:33.460 --> 01:45:37.328
<i>Yes, I'm a citizen!
Are you crazy?</i>

01:45:39.366 --> 01:45:42.267
What relevance a ball in a net

01:45:42.302 --> 01:45:44.236
or a Fruit Roll-Up or a Pop-Tart

01:45:44.271 --> 01:45:46.831
has to do with my
relationship with Andrew?

01:45:46.873 --> 01:45:48.397
If you're
getting excited...

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:51.570
Who are you engaged to?

01:45:51.611 --> 01:45:55.809
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:57.009
Who are you engaged to?

01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:58.745
I'm engaged to Margaret Tate.

01:45:58.785 --> 01:46:04.246
And on the wedding day,
who will be next to you?

01:46:04.291 --> 01:46:06.589
I'm going to marry Margaret Tate.

01:46:06.626 --> 01:46:09.322
- Final answer?
- That work? Yeah, final answer.

01:46:09.363 --> 01:46:12.662
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

01:46:19.773 --> 01:46:21.240
That's a great song.

01:46:21.274 --> 01:46:23.003
That was beautiful.
That was really beautiful.

01:46:23.043 --> 01:46:24.704
Mama Cass.
