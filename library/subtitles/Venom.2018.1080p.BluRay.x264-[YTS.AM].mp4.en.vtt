15
00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.734
I don't want to have to wait
for full clean-up just to get

16
00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:47.437
- a status report.
- We're collecting this data

17
00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.438
- as quickly as possible.
- That's not good enough.

18
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.006
Okay, maybe you can tell me
what happened.

19
00:02:51.008 --> 00:02:52.808
There was some kind of breach.
One of the astronauts

20
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.177
- sent a distress call.
- What about the crew?

21
00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.813
- We're still investigating.
- Where did it go down?

22
00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:00.816
It's 20 kilometers
west of Sibu.

23
00:03:00.818 --> 00:03:03.018
Did we at least retrieve
all of the samples?

24
00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.820
No. We have
three of them.

25
00:03:04.822 --> 00:03:06.787
One of the organisms
got out of containment,

26
00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.860
and it's missing.
We don't know which one.

27
00:03:23.706 --> 00:03:24.906
What is she saying?

28
00:03:24.908 --> 00:03:27.044
One of the astronauts
is still alive.

29
00:03:32.983 --> 00:03:34.049
That's Jameson.

30
00:04:57.833 --> 00:04:59.333
- Morning, sunshine.
- What?

31
00:04:59.335 --> 00:05:00.770
I'm awake.

32
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:03.204
Missed me.

33
00:05:03.206 --> 00:05:04.905
- I'm awake.
- Here you go.

34
00:05:04.907 --> 00:05:07.140
- You can have it back.
- Thank...

35
00:05:07.142 --> 00:05:10.177
Oh, wow,
you're wearing a suit. Yes!

36
00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:12.679
- I love it when you wear the suit.
- Thank you.

37
00:05:12.681 --> 00:05:14.981
I have depositions today
in the Life Foundation case.

38
00:05:14.983 --> 00:05:17.251
Hey, let me know
how your meeting goes.

39
00:05:17.253 --> 00:05:18.886
My meeting?

40
00:05:18.888 --> 00:05:20.753
Oh, shit. Yeah.

41
00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:22.657
My meeting.

42
00:05:26.661 --> 00:05:29.163
- Coffee.
- Oh. Mmm!

43
00:05:29.165 --> 00:05:31.064
- You are perfect.
- Thank you.

44
00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:32.967
Hey, you know what...
You know what night

45
00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.801
- it is tonight, right?
- Date night.

46
00:05:34.803 --> 00:05:37.737
Mmm-hmm. So, I will pick
you up around, uh, 6:00.

47
00:05:37.739 --> 00:05:40.174
And please do not forget
your helmet.

48
00:05:40.176 --> 00:05:41.741
Oh, I'm glad
that you like it,

49
00:05:41.743 --> 00:05:43.244
'cause I plan on wearing it
at our wedding.

50
00:05:43.246 --> 00:05:44.978
That's hot.

51
00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:46.880
Feed the cat.

52
00:05:46.882 --> 00:05:48.182
I will.

53
00:05:48.184 --> 00:05:49.716
I love you!

54
00:05:49.718 --> 00:05:51.318
Love you, too.
Feed the cat.

<i>I'm Eddie Brock,</i>

72
00:06:52.247 --> 00:06:54.047
Hey, Richard!

73
00:06:54.049 --> 00:06:56.715
- Lookin' good!
- Eddie, you can't park there, bro.

74
00:06:56.717 --> 00:06:58.817
Come on, man. There's
no such thing as can't.

75
00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:00.086
How'd she do?

76
00:07:00.088 --> 00:07:03.022
Berkeley. Brown. MIT.

77
00:07:03.024 --> 00:07:05.023
- She's got a scholarship, bro.
- What'd I tell you?

78
00:07:05.025 --> 00:07:06.725
You told me what?

79
00:07:06.727 --> 00:07:08.463
- No such thing as can't.
- Eddie.

80
00:07:09.698 --> 00:07:11.030
The bike.

81
00:07:11.032 --> 00:07:14.434
MIT! Whoo!

82
00:07:14.436 --> 00:07:17.904
You know what I love
about this view?

83
00:07:17.906 --> 00:07:20.739
- It never gets old.
- Yeah, well, uh...

84
00:07:20.741 --> 00:07:23.408
Height's not really my thing.

85
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:25.979
But, uh...
What's the deal?

86
00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:28.348
- I got you the big one, exclusive.
- Yeah? Who?

87
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:29.982
Carlton Drake.

88
00:07:29.984 --> 00:07:32.018
- Carlton Drake?
- The man's a visionary.

89
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.220
He wants to talk
about his rockets,

90
00:07:34.222 --> 00:07:36.922
assure everyone they're safe,
that the crash was an anomaly.

91
00:07:36.924 --> 00:07:38.290
Uh...

92
00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:40.293
He's... He's seriously off.

93
00:07:40.295 --> 00:07:41.994
I'm gonna level with you.

94
00:07:41.996 --> 00:07:44.397
Carlton Drake could buy us
with his pocket cash,

95
00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:47.833
turn this building into his
own garage if he so wished.

96
00:07:47.835 --> 00:07:50.836
Now, you're just gonna ask him
about his space program,

97
00:07:50.838 --> 00:07:53.240
you're gonna thank him, and
you're gonna bid him a nice day.

98
00:07:54.842 --> 00:07:58.176
He's a crook.

99
00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:01.380
Eddie, when you had nowhere
to go, we gave you a home.

100
00:08:01.382 --> 00:08:03.782
Now, you know we love
the Eddie Brock show.

101
00:08:03.784 --> 00:08:06.486
There isn't a better investigative
reporter working today,

102
00:08:06.488 --> 00:08:08.253
but no one
is above the network.

103
00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:11.323
So do me a favor, Eddie,
don't start your shit again.

104
00:08:11.325 --> 00:08:13.025
All right, all right.

105
00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:17.396
- For me.
- All right. I'll do it.

106
00:08:17.398 --> 00:08:19.063
I don't know why he gave
me this assignment, Annie.

107
00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:20.866
It's not...
It's not what I do.

108
00:08:20.868 --> 00:08:22.401
Well, my mother
always told me

109
00:08:22.403 --> 00:08:25.370
that anything in life worth
having would take sacrifice...

110
00:08:25.372 --> 00:08:26.804
- Mmm-hmm.
- Patience...

111
00:08:26.806 --> 00:08:29.007
- Mmm.
- And be a lot of work.

112
00:08:29.009 --> 00:08:30.442
- Oh.
- That's you...

113
00:08:30.444 --> 00:08:32.110
- That's not.
- ...that I'm talking about.

114
00:08:32.112 --> 00:08:33.312
- Nah.
- Yeah.

115
00:08:33.314 --> 00:08:34.513
Well, you're lucky
to have me.

116
00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:36.516
To be fair,
I'm quite a catch.

117
00:08:36.518 --> 00:08:38.984
That's what my mom told me.

118
00:08:38.986 --> 00:08:41.018
Are you gonna
behave yourself tomorrow?

119
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:44.256
No. No, I'm gonna do my job.
That's what I'm gonna do.

120
00:08:44.258 --> 00:08:46.325
I can't, you know,
not do my job.

121
00:08:46.327 --> 00:08:48.193
The guy you work for
is a complete...

122
00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:50.261
I don't work for Drake.
I work for my firm,

123
00:08:50.263 --> 00:08:51.897
and my firm works for him.

124
00:08:51.899 --> 00:08:54.366
And I'm sure
that they defend many people

125
00:08:54.368 --> 00:08:57.469
that you don't deem worthy,
but we don't want a repeat.

126
00:08:57.471 --> 00:09:00.238
- A repeat?
- Of the <i>Daily Globe</i> incident.

127
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.973
Ow! Really?

128
00:09:01.975 --> 00:09:03.809
- Incident? That's not an incident.
- Mmm-hmm.

129
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:05.076
- Baby, you were run out of New York.
- I was not. I did not.

130
00:09:05.078 --> 00:09:06.478
I don't want you
run out of San Francisco.

131
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.014
No, I still have
currency in New York.

132
00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:11.316
I was going places.

133
00:09:11.318 --> 00:09:12.417
I wasn't running.

134
00:09:12.419 --> 00:09:14.185
I was going places.

135
00:09:14.187 --> 00:09:16.021
In fact, I moved
to San Francisco for you.

136
00:09:16.023 --> 00:09:18.889
- Me?
- You are my home.

137
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:21.628
You're not so bad yourself,
champ.

138
00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:27.299
- Less talking, more kissing.
- All right.

139
00:09:27.301 --> 00:09:28.567
Let's just get the check.

140
00:09:56.196 --> 00:09:58.297
I'm gonna get a drink.

141
00:10:42.508 --> 00:10:43.976
Shh.

142
00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:02.560
Very soon,
another Life Foundation rocket

143
00:11:02.562 --> 00:11:05.128
will be sent
on an exploratory mission.

144
00:11:05.130 --> 00:11:08.399
And that's how, one day,
we might all live in space.

145
00:11:08.401 --> 00:11:11.100
Cool, huh? And now that I've shown you

146
00:11:11.102 --> 00:11:13.236
some of the cool stuff
that we do here,

147
00:11:13.238 --> 00:11:15.506
I'm hoping I've inspired
each and every one of you

148
00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.708
to go out there
and create things that others

149
00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:20.109
- have only dreamt of.
- Mr. Drake?

150
00:11:20.111 --> 00:11:23.179
- Shh!
- It's okay. Don't silence her.

151
00:11:23.181 --> 00:11:25.114
Come here. What's your name?

152
00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:27.150
- Allie.
- It's okay, Allie.

153
00:11:27.152 --> 00:11:28.953
You know, sometimes
that's what people do.

154
00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:31.422
They try and silence
those of us who ask questions.

155
00:11:31.424 --> 00:11:33.491
But you know what?
In the end,

156
00:11:33.493 --> 00:11:36.426
we're the ones
who change the world.

157
00:11:36.428 --> 00:11:39.362
Take good care
of that, Allie.

158
00:11:39.364 --> 00:11:41.130
Guys, this is Dr. Skirth.

159
00:11:41.132 --> 00:11:42.499
- Say hi.
- Hi.

160
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:43.701
Hello, kids.

161
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.735
Um, sorry to interrupt,

162
00:11:45.737 --> 00:11:48.104
but it's time to get changed
for your interview.

163
00:11:48.106 --> 00:11:50.306
Yeah. Uh, kids,
sorry to leave you.

164
00:11:50.308 --> 00:11:52.609
Allie, you're in charge.
High five up top.

165
00:11:52.611 --> 00:11:56.079
Dr. Skirth will answer Allie's
question, and any others.

166
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:57.982
- See you next time, guys. Bye!
- Bye!

167
00:11:57.984 --> 00:12:00.016
<i>What do you say,
Mr. Drake,</i>

168
00:12:00.018 --> 00:12:01.751
we just start
at the beginning?

169
00:12:01.753 --> 00:12:04.020
- Born to British parents.
- Mmm-hmm.

170
00:12:04.022 --> 00:12:07.323
And then at 19, you
discovered a gene therapy

171
00:12:07.325 --> 00:12:10.125
that literally doubles
the life expectancy

172
00:12:10.127 --> 00:12:11.629
- of pancreatic cancer patients.
- Well, actually,

173
00:12:11.631 --> 00:12:13.696
it tripled their
life expectancy.

174
00:12:13.698 --> 00:12:15.365
But it's okay.

175
00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:18.401
Okay, um, 24.
That's still extremely young.

176
00:12:18.403 --> 00:12:20.403
All right, you create

177
00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:22.105
- the Life Foundation!
- It didn't happen overnight.

178
00:12:22.107 --> 00:12:23.773
- And then...
- Rockets.

179
00:12:23.775 --> 00:12:26.009
You then decide,
like any normal human being,

180
00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:28.012
that you're gonna go
and explore space.

181
00:12:28.014 --> 00:12:30.313
You know what it is?
I have always believed...

182
00:12:30.315 --> 00:12:32.147
- Uh-huh.
- ...that space exploration

183
00:12:32.149 --> 00:12:33.750
is crucial
in our quest to cure

184
00:12:33.752 --> 00:12:35.686
everything that ails us
here on Earth.

185
00:12:35.688 --> 00:12:37.253
But if you think about
everything we've found...

186
00:12:37.255 --> 00:12:38.688
- Uh-huh.
- ...in the oceans and on land,

187
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.623
- isn't it time to look up there?
- Mmm-hmm.

188
00:12:40.625 --> 00:12:43.125
To this plethora
of untapped resources?

189
00:12:43.127 --> 00:12:44.627
And you have a plethora
of untapped resources, also,

190
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:46.462
from your pharmaceutical
companies

191
00:12:46.464 --> 00:12:48.263
that you're involved with,
you know, to help you realize

192
00:12:48.265 --> 00:12:49.464
- that ambition, I suppose.
- Of course.

193
00:12:49.466 --> 00:12:50.800
- Yeah.
- Full circle.

194
00:12:50.802 --> 00:12:53.102
So, I have to ask,
how does that work,

195
00:12:53.104 --> 00:12:54.704
you know, exactly,
the Life Foundation thing?

196
00:12:54.706 --> 00:12:56.706
How does it...
How does it, um...

197
00:12:56.708 --> 00:12:58.640
I don't know,
how does it go about,

198
00:12:58.642 --> 00:13:01.711
- say, testing pharmaceuticals?
- Eddie, we're talking

199
00:13:01.713 --> 00:13:03.546
- about the rocket here.
- No, I'm not. I'm not.

200
00:13:03.548 --> 00:13:05.547
I'm talking
about the allegations.

201
00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:07.149
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- It says that

202
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:08.651
your entire empire
has been built

203
00:13:08.653 --> 00:13:10.720
- on dead bodies.
- Eddie.

204
00:13:10.722 --> 00:13:13.155
It's true, right?
It says that you recruit

205
00:13:13.157 --> 00:13:15.358
the most vulnerable of us
to volunteer for tests...

206
00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:16.693
- Hmm.
- ...that more often than not

207
00:13:16.695 --> 00:13:18.260
end up killing people.

208
00:13:18.262 --> 00:13:19.762
Yeah, I'm aware
of these rumors online.

209
00:13:19.764 --> 00:13:21.129
There's a lot of fake news
out there these days.

210
00:13:21.131 --> 00:13:22.564
Right. What about
the legal cases?

211
00:13:22.566 --> 00:13:24.132
Sorry?

212
00:13:24.134 --> 00:13:26.268
Uh, the actual legal cases,
like Sarah Chambers,

213
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:28.203
- Phil Barclay, Rob MacDonald.
- That's it. Time to go.

214
00:13:28.205 --> 00:13:29.538
Thank you so much for coming
to talk to me, Mr. Brock.

215
00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:31.138
And they're just some
of the people who walked

216
00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:33.141
- through these doors...
- Have a nice day.

217
00:13:33.143 --> 00:13:34.811
- Cut the camera off, please.
- Thank you very much.

218
00:13:34.813 --> 00:13:36.511
- Time is up. Come on.
- They're dead. The Dead...

219
00:13:36.513 --> 00:13:37.779
- Could you show him out, please?
- The Dead Found...

220
00:13:37.781 --> 00:13:39.582
Don't touch me.
The Dead Foundation thing.

221
00:13:39.584 --> 00:13:40.450
- Get out of here, Brock.
- We're not finished.

222
00:13:40.452 --> 00:13:41.316
Yes, you are, Mr. Brock.

223
00:13:41.318 --> 00:13:42.184
Is that a threat?

224
00:13:42.186 --> 00:13:43.821
Have a nice life.

225
00:13:46.390 --> 00:13:49.491
I know what
you're going to say, but...

226
00:13:49.493 --> 00:13:52.160
This guy, he is
all the way bad, Jack.

227
00:13:52.162 --> 00:13:54.195
- If you just give...
- Who's your source?

228
00:13:54.197 --> 00:13:56.735
- Excuse me?
- Who's your source, Eddie?

229
00:14:01.137 --> 00:14:04.172
I don't have a source, per se.
But I have a hunch.

230
00:14:04.174 --> 00:14:06.141
This isn't the Wild Wild West.

231
00:14:06.143 --> 00:14:08.877
We don't go off half-cocked
based on a hunch.

232
00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:10.444
We do the work.

233
00:14:10.446 --> 00:14:13.148
We substantiate
our accusations.

234
00:14:13.150 --> 00:14:15.217
We provide evidence.

235
00:14:15.219 --> 00:14:18.553
You know, for a smart guy,
you really are a dumbass.

236
00:14:24.828 --> 00:14:26.494
You're fired, Eddie.

237
00:14:26.496 --> 00:14:28.497
I can't trust you.

238
00:14:28.499 --> 00:14:31.133
Have a nice life.

239
00:14:31.135 --> 00:14:32.903
- Will just take a second.
- Okay.

240
00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.771
Hey.

241
00:14:35.773 --> 00:14:37.773
You are pathologically
self-absorbed.

242
00:14:37.775 --> 00:14:39.306
Annie. Annie,
can you talk to me first?

243
00:14:39.308 --> 00:14:40.341
Your ego requires
constant attention,

244
00:14:40.343 --> 00:14:42.410
and you're stubborn as hell.

245
00:14:42.412 --> 00:14:44.646
But I was willing to roll with
it, Eddie, because I loved you.

246
00:14:44.648 --> 00:14:46.817
You "loved" me?
What is that supposed to mean?

247
00:14:48.786 --> 00:14:50.853
What you did
got me fired.

248
00:14:52.289 --> 00:14:53.691
You used me.

249
00:15:00.564 --> 00:15:03.734
Annie? Annie.

250
00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:38.367
Oh, my God.

251
00:15:41.704 --> 00:15:43.506
You're beautiful.

252
00:17:40.857 --> 00:17:42.555
Test 36.

253
00:17:42.557 --> 00:17:44.090
Biological interactions

254
00:17:44.092 --> 00:17:46.425
between two different organisms.

255
00:17:46.427 --> 00:17:49.029
These creatures need to bond
with a respiratory host

256
00:17:49.031 --> 00:17:51.064
in order to survive
for any amount of time

257
00:17:51.066 --> 00:17:52.899
in an oxygen-rich environment.

258
00:17:52.901 --> 00:17:54.334
Well, why are
all these hosts

259
00:17:54.336 --> 00:17:55.870
showing this hyper-acute
rejection?

260
00:17:55.872 --> 00:17:57.839
That's what
we're trying to find out.

261
00:18:00.475 --> 00:18:02.077
The bonding process
is starting.

262
00:18:07.482 --> 00:18:08.583
It's equalizing.

263
00:18:14.756 --> 00:18:17.656
But why? Why this rabbit?

264
00:18:17.658 --> 00:18:20.361
- It's similar to an organ transplant.
- Huh.

265
00:18:20.363 --> 00:18:23.096
Where the donor and recipient
must be an exact match?

266
00:18:23.098 --> 00:18:25.664
- That's correct.
- Okay. So wait, think about it.

267
00:18:25.666 --> 00:18:29.535
If we do achieve symbiosis, they
should be able to survive here,

268
00:18:29.537 --> 00:18:33.839
but also we would
be able to survive there.

269
00:18:33.841 --> 00:18:35.541
"We"?

270
00:18:35.543 --> 00:18:37.677
- Begin human trials.
- Oh, it's way too soon

271
00:18:37.679 --> 00:18:39.645
to even begin to think
about something like...

272
00:18:39.647 --> 00:18:41.080
Dr. Skirth, you're at the forefront
of a scientific breakthrough.

273
00:18:41.082 --> 00:18:43.583
I need you to hold your nerve.
All right?

274
00:18:43.585 --> 00:18:45.385
I understand,
but it's an ethical question.

275
00:18:45.387 --> 00:18:47.120
Think of future generations.
Think of your kids.

276
00:18:47.122 --> 00:18:48.989
Hey, how are your kids?

277
00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:52.525
Let's begin human trials.

278
00:18:52.527 --> 00:18:53.662
Good work.

279
00:19:15.984 --> 00:19:17.118
Hey, Jack.

280
00:19:18.819 --> 00:19:21.086
Do you ever feel
like your life

281
00:19:21.088 --> 00:19:24.723
- is like one monumental screwup?
- Nope.

282
00:19:24.725 --> 00:19:26.458
<i>Here at the Life Foundation,</i>

283
00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.493
- <i>we've always believed...</i>
- Isn't that your buddy?

284
00:19:28.495 --> 00:19:29.962
<i>...in finding the lessons
in our disappointments.</i>

285
00:19:29.964 --> 00:19:31.663
<i>In the months
since our rocket failed,</i>

286
00:19:31.665 --> 00:19:33.199
<i>we've learned so much.</i>

287
00:19:33.201 --> 00:19:36.436
Do you think we could,
like, switch him off?

288
00:19:36.438 --> 00:19:37.903
Some people
are trying to watch that.

289
00:19:37.905 --> 00:19:39.439
Oh, you are, are you?

290
00:19:39.441 --> 00:19:41.809
- Yeah?
- Aren't you Eddie Brock?

291
00:19:43.711 --> 00:19:45.444
I used to be.

292
00:19:45.446 --> 00:19:47.113
<i>We take
the same view of progress.</i>

293
00:19:47.115 --> 00:19:49.748
<i>Thrilled to announce
that the Life Foundation</i>

294
00:19:49.750 --> 00:19:52.718
<i>has now begun preparations
on its next launch.</i>

295
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.119
All right, Jack,
this is for you.

296
00:19:54.121 --> 00:19:56.089
I do not want you
to spend it all at once.

297
00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:58.123
I'm going to go home and chase
myself around the room,

298
00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.125
playing hard to get.

299
00:20:03.731 --> 00:20:05.597
- Hey, Maria.
- Eddie.

300
00:20:05.599 --> 00:20:08.233
- How's it going?
- Righteous, Eddie.

301
00:20:08.235 --> 00:20:10.237
Oh! Yeah, we're empty.

302
00:20:12.973 --> 00:20:14.606
Cost you $5.

303
00:20:14.608 --> 00:20:16.741
$5 for a paper that's free?

304
00:20:16.743 --> 00:20:18.743
I walked all the way over
to the vending machine,

305
00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:21.546
got the papers out and
brought 'em back over here,

306
00:20:21.548 --> 00:20:24.016
so you can have 'em
personally delivered to you.

307
00:20:24.018 --> 00:20:25.083
You did that for me?

308
00:20:25.085 --> 00:20:26.686
- Yes, I did.
- Oh.

309
00:20:28.222 --> 00:20:30.756
- Five bucks.
- That's pretty steep.

310
00:20:30.758 --> 00:20:33.191
Tell you what, you give
me a dollar for a song,

311
00:20:33.193 --> 00:20:34.859
I'll throw in the paper.

312
00:20:34.861 --> 00:20:37.595
I'll tell you what,
I will give you 20 bucks,

313
00:20:37.597 --> 00:20:39.066
but not to sing,
all right?

314
00:20:39.699 --> 00:20:40.831
Deal.

315
00:20:40.833 --> 00:20:42.733
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

316
00:20:42.735 --> 00:20:46.570
No. You're welcome.

317
00:20:46.572 --> 00:20:48.873
Hey, Mrs. Chen.

318
00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:51.143
- How you doing, Eddie?
- Ah, aches and pains,

319
00:20:51.145 --> 00:20:53.145
you know, aches and pains.

320
00:20:53.147 --> 00:20:54.314
You look like shit.

321
00:20:55.215 --> 00:20:56.714
Excuse me?

322
00:20:56.716 --> 00:20:58.084
You look like shit.

323
00:20:59.653 --> 00:21:02.287
And you look
as beautiful as ever.

324
00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:05.022
- Jesus.
- Mind is body, Eddie.

325
00:21:05.024 --> 00:21:06.892
Have you been meditating
like I showed you?

326
00:21:06.894 --> 00:21:08.894
- No, I have not. And it does not work.
- It doesn't work,

327
00:21:08.896 --> 00:21:11.028
- because you don't give it a chance.
- No, it doesn't work,

328
00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:14.231
because I bought a DVD off your
cousin, and it was in Mandarin.

329
00:21:14.233 --> 00:21:17.035
Yeah, I don't understand that, either.

330
00:21:17.037 --> 00:21:18.769
See, that right there, I don't
understand what you just said.

331
00:21:18.771 --> 00:21:19.937
That is the problem.

332
00:21:24.911 --> 00:21:27.812
Bottle of whiskey,
and don't forget my change.

333
00:21:27.814 --> 00:21:30.214
Please.

334
00:21:30.216 --> 00:21:31.682
Let's go.

335
00:21:31.684 --> 00:21:33.185
Before the price goes up
for my protection.

336
00:21:35.988 --> 00:21:39.224
The full payment is due.
Now.

337
00:21:39.226 --> 00:21:41.326
Make sure you have
my money ready, Chen.

338
00:21:41.328 --> 00:21:43.029
I don't like to wait.

339
00:22:01.214 --> 00:22:02.315
Life hurts, Eddie.

340
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:04.317
It just does.

341
00:22:21.666 --> 00:22:24.667
I gotta go.

342
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:28.739
- Okay. Love you, babe.
- See you, babe.

343
00:22:32.145 --> 00:22:33.377
What a dick.

344
00:23:02.908 --> 00:23:04.741
I'm not even
asking to staff there.

345
00:23:04.743 --> 00:23:06.276
Why would I do that?
I can't use my name.

346
00:23:06.278 --> 00:23:07.744
I can use a pseudonym.

347
00:23:07.746 --> 00:23:09.213
Any name. Think...
You pick a name.

348
00:23:09.215 --> 00:23:11.214
I could be a woman.
Have you seen <i>Tootsie?</i>

349
00:23:17.055 --> 00:23:18.121
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

350
00:23:18.123 --> 00:23:19.991
Okay, I won't. Thank you. Bye.

351
00:23:25.997 --> 00:23:31.435
<i>Realize deeply that the
present moment is all you ever have.</i>

352
00:23:31.437 --> 00:23:35.271
<i>Make the now the primary
focus of your life.</i>

353
00:23:35.273 --> 00:23:37.739
<i>Any action is often better
than no action,</i>

354
00:23:37.741 --> 00:23:39.376
<i>especially if you
have been stuck</i>

355
00:23:39.378 --> 00:23:43.112
<i>in an unhappy situation
for a long time.</i>

356
00:23:43.114 --> 00:23:46.115
<i>If it is a mistake, at least
you learned something,</i>

357
00:23:46.117 --> 00:23:47.750
<i>in which case
it's no longer...</i>

358
00:24:07.272 --> 00:24:10.005
Thank you all for
bringing us to this moment.

359
00:24:10.007 --> 00:24:14.444
Our names will be spoken
long after we are dust.

360
00:24:14.446 --> 00:24:16.113
History starts now.

361
00:24:17.047 --> 00:24:18.815
This is day one.

362
00:24:18.817 --> 00:24:22.085
This is first contact.

363
00:24:22.087 --> 00:24:24.454
Let's get to work.

364
00:24:37.302 --> 00:24:39.437
<i>Establishing subject baseline.</i>

365
00:24:41.472 --> 00:24:43.774
<i>All vital signs are normal.</i>

366
00:24:50.381 --> 00:24:52.515
Put me through.

367
00:24:52.517 --> 00:24:54.352
There's no need to be
frightened, Isaac.

368
00:24:56.787 --> 00:24:58.153
There's no need.

369
00:24:58.155 --> 00:25:01.189
Isaac. You know
that's a biblical name?

370
00:25:01.191 --> 00:25:03.225
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

371
00:25:03.227 --> 00:25:05.360
<i>God said to Abraham,
"Give me your son,</i>

372
00:25:05.362 --> 00:25:08.096
<i>"show me you are willing
to sacrifice the one thing</i>

373
00:25:08.098 --> 00:25:11.266
"most precious to you,"
and Abraham was willing.

374
00:25:11.268 --> 00:25:13.335
You know what's always
impressed me about that story?

375
00:25:13.337 --> 00:25:16.408
<i>It isn't Abraham's sacrifice.
It's Isaac's.</i>

376
00:25:21.045 --> 00:25:23.945
<i>Now, I don't know what kind of
God would ask that of someone,</i>

377
00:25:23.947 --> 00:25:25.280
<i>but it doesn't change
anything for me.</i>

378
00:25:25.282 --> 00:25:30.084
Isaac is still the hero
of this story.

379
00:25:30.086 --> 00:25:32.988
Look around you.
Look at the world.

380
00:25:32.990 --> 00:25:34.456
<i>What do you see?
War, poverty,</i>

381
00:25:34.458 --> 00:25:36.824
<i>a planet on the brink
of collapse.</i>

382
00:25:36.826 --> 00:25:39.895
<i>I would argue that God
has abandoned us.</i>

383
00:25:39.897 --> 00:25:41.530
He didn't keep
his end of the bargain, Isaac,

384
00:25:41.532 --> 00:25:44.566
<i>so now it's down to you and me
to put this right.</i>

385
00:25:44.568 --> 00:25:47.104
<i>And this time, Isaac,
we can.</i>

386
00:25:51.475 --> 00:25:53.107
We will.

387
00:25:53.109 --> 00:25:56.180
<i>This time,
I will not abandon us.</i>

388
00:25:58.515 --> 00:25:59.583
<i>Yes.</i>

389
00:26:02.486 --> 00:26:03.487
Open it.

390
00:26:16.467 --> 00:26:18.566
What the hell is that?
What? No, what...

391
00:26:18.568 --> 00:26:20.302
<i>Please let me... No.</i>

392
00:26:20.304 --> 00:26:22.471
Oh, please, please, please!

393
00:26:39.922 --> 00:26:42.624
His vitals are holding steady.

394
00:26:42.626 --> 00:26:45.327
- Where the hell did it go?
- <i>Incredible.</i>

395
00:26:45.329 --> 00:26:46.896
<i>Where did it go?</i>

396
00:26:51.502 --> 00:26:53.067
<i>Where is it?</i>

397
00:27:31.073 --> 00:27:32.375
Bring in the next volunteer.

398
00:28:01.436 --> 00:28:04.138
You know,
I used to be a reporter.

399
00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.539
I was...

400
00:28:05.541 --> 00:28:08.274
I was pretty successful,
as well, you know?

401
00:28:08.276 --> 00:28:12.446
My job, it required you to...
You know, to follow people

402
00:28:12.448 --> 00:28:17.984
that did not want to be followed
and hide in plain sight.

403
00:28:17.986 --> 00:28:19.553
I mean...

404
00:28:19.555 --> 00:28:21.357
You have to know
how to disappear.

405
00:28:23.058 --> 00:28:26.426
I was pretty good, but,
you know, you...

406
00:28:26.428 --> 00:28:28.364
Whoever you are, you suck.

407
00:28:29.365 --> 00:28:31.331
Okay.

408
00:28:31.333 --> 00:28:33.399
- Uh, my name is Dora Skirth.
- Mmm.

409
00:28:33.401 --> 00:28:34.735
I need your help.

410
00:28:34.737 --> 00:28:36.437
- I work at the Life Foundation.
- You do?

411
00:28:36.439 --> 00:28:38.171
- Yes.
- Wow. Good for you.

412
00:28:38.173 --> 00:28:40.173
We're done.

413
00:28:40.175 --> 00:28:41.774
No...

414
00:28:41.776 --> 00:28:45.111
Mr. Brock, please...
Please listen to me.

415
00:28:45.113 --> 00:28:47.180
Everything that you
accused him of,

416
00:28:47.182 --> 00:28:48.515
you were right.
It's all true.

417
00:28:48.517 --> 00:28:50.048
- I don't care anymore.
- Really?

418
00:28:50.050 --> 00:28:52.118
Because he's got a lab
filled with poor people,

419
00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:54.454
and they're all signing waivers
that they don't understand,

420
00:28:54.456 --> 00:28:56.289
and he's using them
like guinea pigs,

421
00:28:56.291 --> 00:28:58.358
and they are dying.

422
00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.460
They are all dying.

423
00:29:00.462 --> 00:29:02.030
- You've seen that?
- Yes.

424
00:29:02.999 --> 00:29:04.199
Come here.

425
00:29:06.233 --> 00:29:07.434
Why would I believe you?

426
00:29:07.436 --> 00:29:08.602
Because it's true.

427
00:29:08.604 --> 00:29:10.370
I believed in him, and I...

428
00:29:10.372 --> 00:29:12.305
I told myself
that it was worth it

429
00:29:12.307 --> 00:29:14.475
because we were curing cancer,
but now this is different.

430
00:29:14.477 --> 00:29:16.042
- Something else.
- Go to the cops.

431
00:29:16.044 --> 00:29:17.343
I can't do that.

432
00:29:17.345 --> 00:29:19.145
I'm afraid of what
will happen to my family.

433
00:29:19.147 --> 00:29:20.780
He's a very dangerous man, and
he's a very powerful man...

434
00:29:20.782 --> 00:29:22.448
I know, I know
how dangerous he is,

435
00:29:22.450 --> 00:29:24.117
because the very first time
I interviewed him,

436
00:29:24.119 --> 00:29:26.319
just once, I lose my job
the very next day.

437
00:29:26.321 --> 00:29:28.688
I lost my career,
I lost my relationship,

438
00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.457
I lost my apartment, I lost
everything I ever cared about.

439
00:29:31.459 --> 00:29:33.762
You know why? Carlton Drake
ruined me. Finished.

440
00:29:35.196 --> 00:29:37.296
Now, if you are
who you say you are,

441
00:29:37.298 --> 00:29:39.599
genuinely,
and you have proof,

442
00:29:39.601 --> 00:29:42.669
then you should be
very, very, very afraid.

443
00:29:42.671 --> 00:29:44.704
I am.

444
00:29:44.706 --> 00:29:46.706
You need to find yourself another
white knight, Ms. Skirth,

445
00:29:46.708 --> 00:29:48.174
because I am done.

446
00:29:48.176 --> 00:29:49.544
I am done
with all of this shit.

447
00:29:50.412 --> 00:29:51.778
What shit?

448
00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.747
All of this "saving my
fellow man" shit.

449
00:29:54.749 --> 00:29:56.318
All right? Good night.

450
00:30:15.502 --> 00:30:16.503
Eddie?

451
00:30:17.571 --> 00:30:19.105
Well, hey. Whoa.

452
00:30:19.107 --> 00:30:22.140
Anne, I was just walking by,
and, uh...

453
00:30:22.142 --> 00:30:23.475
I saw Mr. Belvedere.

454
00:30:23.477 --> 00:30:25.243
I felt concerned for
his welfare, so...

455
00:30:25.245 --> 00:30:27.080
Eddie...

456
00:30:27.082 --> 00:30:28.681
This is Dan.

457
00:30:28.683 --> 00:30:30.717
- Dan, this is Eddie.
- Yeah.

458
00:30:30.719 --> 00:30:32.451
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

459
00:30:32.453 --> 00:30:34.119
- Yeah.
- Annie's told me a lot about you.

460
00:30:34.121 --> 00:30:35.187
- Really?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:35.189 --> 00:30:37.189
I'm a big fan of your work.

462
00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:39.524
- Thank you.
- Really?

463
00:30:39.526 --> 00:30:41.729
It's pretty cool, all the
people that he took down.

464
00:30:42.631 --> 00:30:44.164
Yeah, I was one of them.

465
00:30:46.333 --> 00:30:47.699
Well, look,
I'll let you guys catch up.

466
00:30:47.701 --> 00:30:49.336
- So I'll see you inside?
- You're the best.

467
00:30:51.305 --> 00:30:53.207
- Really nice meeting you, man.
- Uh, you, too.

468
00:31:00.247 --> 00:31:02.416
He has a key. You know he has a key?

469
00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.784
Yeah. How else
would he get in?

470
00:31:07.689 --> 00:31:11.256
Yeah. Well, uh...

471
00:31:11.258 --> 00:31:13.659
So, uh, what you up to?

472
00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:16.862
You realize that's light-years away
from being any of your business, right?

473
00:31:16.864 --> 00:31:18.899
Hey, well, just asking,
you know.

474
00:31:20.134 --> 00:31:22.467
So, is Dan, uh, a lawyer?

475
00:31:22.469 --> 00:31:24.436
No, he's a doctor.

476
00:31:24.438 --> 00:31:26.473
- Surgeon, actually.
- Oh.

477
00:31:27.841 --> 00:31:29.473
How's Mr. Belvedere, anyway?

478
00:31:29.475 --> 00:31:30.910
I would say
that he misses you,

479
00:31:30.912 --> 00:31:32.678
but that would be bullshit,
'cause...

480
00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:34.379
- He's a cat.
- No, because he never liked you.

481
00:31:34.381 --> 00:31:35.781
No, he's a cat,
and cats don't like anyone.

482
00:31:35.783 --> 00:31:38.150
You look good, by the way.
You doing good?

483
00:31:38.152 --> 00:31:39.351
What are you
doing here, Eddie?

484
00:31:39.353 --> 00:31:40.421
I'm here 'cause I miss you.

485
00:31:41.522 --> 00:31:43.421
A lot.

486
00:31:43.423 --> 00:31:44.823
You know, we were gonna
get married.

487
00:31:44.825 --> 00:31:47.392
That wasn't so long ago,
and now, you know...

488
00:31:47.394 --> 00:31:49.296
I can't really believe
that we're not...

489
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:53.700
Are we gonna try
and find our way back?

490
00:31:54.668 --> 00:31:56.203
No, we can't.

491
00:31:58.739 --> 00:32:00.339
You did this, Eddie.

492
00:32:02.241 --> 00:32:04.910
Not Carlton Drake,
not the network.

493
00:32:04.912 --> 00:32:05.979
You.

494
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.346
<i>Uh, hello.
This is Dr. Skirth.</i>

495
00:33:15.348 --> 00:33:16.749
Yes, Eddie Brock here.

496
00:33:18.451 --> 00:33:19.585
Talk to me.

497
00:33:23.523 --> 00:33:25.689
Are you sure
this is gonna work?

498
00:33:25.691 --> 00:33:27.026
Just stay down
and shut up, please.

499
00:33:29.294 --> 00:33:31.898
<i>53.5,
win-909 RPM.</i>

500
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:38.969
Whew.

501
00:33:38.971 --> 00:33:41.539
<i>Overpopulation
and climate change.</i>

502
00:33:41.541 --> 00:33:43.674
These are two things
that Drake cannot control.

503
00:33:43.676 --> 00:33:45.642
Yeah, got it, right.

504
00:33:45.644 --> 00:33:48.679
We are literally a generation
away from an uninhabitable Earth.

505
00:33:48.681 --> 00:33:51.514
- Uh, yeah.
- Drake is using his personal rockets

506
00:33:51.516 --> 00:33:53.616
to scout real estate.

507
00:33:53.618 --> 00:33:55.486
You know, it's a really
interesting story,

508
00:33:55.488 --> 00:33:57.621
but we need to just get to the
part where he's killing people.

509
00:33:57.623 --> 00:34:00.690
Drake sent a ship
on a recon mission.

510
00:34:00.692 --> 00:34:03.527
On the way back,
they found a comet.

511
00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:05.830
A comet?

512
00:34:05.832 --> 00:34:08.898
Onboard computers indicated the presence
of life, of millions of organisms.

513
00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:10.835
Wait, wait, wait, when you
say "millions of organisms,"

514
00:34:10.837 --> 00:34:12.636
- what do you mean?
- We brought back some specimens.

515
00:34:12.638 --> 00:34:14.305
You're talking about aliens?

516
00:34:14.307 --> 00:34:16.706
Like, aliens?

517
00:34:16.708 --> 00:34:18.074
E.T. phone home.

518
00:34:18.076 --> 00:34:19.810
Aliens, yeah.

519
00:34:19.812 --> 00:34:22.345
Yes.

520
00:34:22.347 --> 00:34:23.548
But we don't
call them that.

521
00:34:25.383 --> 00:34:27.417
- We call them Symbiotes.
- Symbiotes?

522
00:34:27.419 --> 00:34:30.087
And they cannot survive in
our environment without help.

523
00:34:30.089 --> 00:34:34.558
Drake believes that the union
between human and Symbiote

524
00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:37.427
is the key to our survival,
but not here on Earth.

525
00:34:37.429 --> 00:34:41.898
Drake is trying to put human
beings and aliens together?

526
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:43.399
So they can live in space?

527
00:34:43.401 --> 00:34:44.834
We call them hosts.

528
00:34:44.836 --> 00:34:47.637
That's nuts, isn't it?
That's completely insane.

529
00:34:47.639 --> 00:34:49.739
Yes. There's no protocol
for this thing.

530
00:34:49.741 --> 00:34:51.008

00:34:59.918 --> 00:35:01.453

- I don't know how to get you...

- I don't know how.

a great call on the lab.

Oh, I got a bunch of

570

Call me back.

580
00:40:15.864 --> 00:40:18.301
Well, we assume
the intruder took it.

581

582
00:40:23.905 --> 00:40:26.106
We don't know what happened.

who was on duty last night.

584
00:40:28.076 --> 00:40:29.209
- Already did, sir.
- But I didn't.

585
00:40:29.211 --> 00:40:31.044
Get it out of my sight.

586
00:40:31.046 --> 00:40:33.179
- Carlton, you need to see this.
- What now?

587
00:40:33.181 --> 00:40:35.048
His blood
pressure's back to normal.

588

589
00:40:39.254 --> 00:40:41.120
I knew it.

590
00:40:41.122 --> 00:40:43.124
See, his body just needed
time to adjust.

591
00:40:46.127 --> 00:40:48.127
I don't want to waste any more time.
I want to up the tests.

592
00:40:48.129 --> 00:40:49.497
- Okay?
- Yeah.

593
00:40:51.766 --> 00:40:52.867

688
00:45:15.994 --> 00:45:18.127
- Oh, boy.
- Hey, Mrs. Manfredi. How are you?

689
00:45:18.129 --> 00:45:19.697
Oh, I just saw Morris.

690
00:45:19.699 --> 00:45:23.033
And he's whining and complaining
like an old baby again.

691
00:45:23.035 --> 00:45:24.969
- Oh, good.
- Oh, thank you so much.

692
00:45:24.971 --> 00:45:27.036
Yeah, my pleasure.

693
00:45:27.038 --> 00:45:28.738
Okay, Mrs. Manfredi,
we talked about the dog.

694
00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:30.341
Okay, love the dog.
You can't have the dog.

695
00:45:30.343 --> 00:45:32.409
Sorry. Gemini.

696
00:45:32.411 --> 00:45:34.043
We're gonna get to the bottom of this.
All right? That I can promise you.

697
00:45:34.045 --> 00:45:35.478
- But for now, go home, get some rest.
- Uh-huh.

698
00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.046
I'll call you when
your tests are in.

699
00:45:37.048 --> 00:45:38.382
- All right, thank you.
- Okay? Yep.

700
00:45:38.384 --> 00:45:39.519
- Thank you, Dan. Thank you.
- You got it.

701
00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:43.520
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hi.

702
00:45:43.522 --> 00:45:44.754
Did you have
the same reactions

703
00:45:44.756 --> 00:45:46.423
regardless
of the temperature...

704
00:45:49.327 --> 00:45:51.029
Good afternoon,
Dr. Skirth.

705
00:45:56.234 --> 00:45:58.368
The creature
and the host are one.

706
00:45:58.370 --> 00:46:00.036
Everything was fine.

707
00:46:00.038 --> 00:46:02.640
So, why does the human
continue to waste away?

708
00:46:02.642 --> 00:46:05.642
I don't know. We've given him enough
liquid nutrition to feed an elephant.

709
00:46:05.644 --> 00:46:07.176
But the organism
is unaffected?

710
00:46:07.178 --> 00:46:08.545
- The Symbiote is thriving.
- Good.

711
00:46:08.547 --> 00:46:10.748
But once again,
it's killing the host.

712
00:46:10.750 --> 00:46:11.784
It's consuming his organs.

713
00:46:13.118 --> 00:46:14.452
Oh, watch this.

714
00:46:18.791 --> 00:46:20.456
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing?
You're hurting it. Stop it!

715
00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.360
Sounds in the 4,000 to 6,000 hertz
range are very harmful for it.

716
00:46:25.362 --> 00:46:28.032
- Well, then don't make those sounds.
- Okay.

717
00:46:29.301 --> 00:46:31.099
He was stabilizing.
What happened?

718
00:46:31.101 --> 00:46:32.236
He's approaching
acute liver failure.

719
00:46:33.404 --> 00:46:35.338
We're gonna need another host.

720
00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:37.373
Such poor design.

721
00:46:37.375 --> 00:46:40.208
- Excuse me?
- Human beings.

722
00:46:40.210 --> 00:46:41.478
Sorry to interrupt.

723
00:46:44.249 --> 00:46:46.081
Thought you'd like
some good news.

724
00:46:46.083 --> 00:46:47.786
I'm sorry.

725
00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:00.096
<i>Hungry!</i>

726
00:47:00.098 --> 00:47:02.264
Oh, goddamn.

727
00:47:02.266 --> 00:47:04.166
I'm okay.
Don't worry about me.

728
00:47:04.168 --> 00:47:06.369
Can I get through, please?
Excuse me.

729
00:47:06.371 --> 00:47:07.670
Thank you.

730
00:47:07.672 --> 00:47:09.237
I'm just gonna stay here,
all right?

731
00:47:09.239 --> 00:47:11.810
Until the cable car stops.

732
00:47:16.748 --> 00:47:18.848
We're good.
All right. Thank you.

733
00:47:18.850 --> 00:47:20.851
Excuse me.

734
00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:27.255
Oh, hey, Anne.

735
00:47:27.257 --> 00:47:30.226
Eddie, hi. How you feeling?

736
00:47:30.228 --> 00:47:32.127
Oh, feeling... I'm sick.

737
00:47:32.129 --> 00:47:35.230
Well, Eddie,
you have a parasite.

738
00:47:35.232 --> 00:47:37.100
They're not exactly sure
how you got it,

739
00:47:37.102 --> 00:47:38.835
but it would
explain the fever.

740
00:47:38.837 --> 00:47:40.435
<i>That would make sense.</i>

741
00:47:40.437 --> 00:47:44.306
Also, I'm hearing,
uh, a voice.

742
00:47:44.308 --> 00:47:46.208
<i>Auditory hallucinations
are actually very common.</i>

743
00:47:46.210 --> 00:47:47.577
Oh, hey, Dan.
How you doing?

744
00:47:47.579 --> 00:47:49.211
<i>I didn't realize that
you were on the call, too.</i>

745
00:47:49.213 --> 00:47:51.446
- Yeah, I'm here.
- Mmm.

746
00:47:51.448 --> 00:47:53.348
Hey, Dan,
would this parasite...

747
00:47:53.350 --> 00:47:55.283
Would it, like, be able to
make me, I don't know...

748
00:47:55.285 --> 00:47:58.420
Like, climb a really, really,
really tall tree,

749
00:47:58.422 --> 00:48:00.455
but super, super fast?

750
00:48:00.457 --> 00:48:02.224
<i>Yes. We just did.</i>

751
00:48:02.226 --> 00:48:03.592
<i>Uh, well, Eddie,
it sounds like</i>

752
00:48:03.594 --> 00:48:05.460
it might be causing
some metabolic abnormalities

753
00:48:05.462 --> 00:48:07.629
that are making it hard for your
body to maintain homeostasis.

754
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:10.532
You said "causing" and "body,"
and... I lost you.

755
00:48:10.534 --> 00:48:12.501
Listen, Eddie, um, we are
gonna get you on some meds,

756
00:48:12.503 --> 00:48:13.835
and we are gonna
clear that out.

757
00:48:13.837 --> 00:48:15.404
- Yes.
- <i>Never gonna happen.</i>

758
00:48:15.406 --> 00:48:18.141
Will you stop doing that now.
Not now.

759
00:48:18.143 --> 00:48:19.808
- Eddie, we're just trying to help you.
- <i>I know.</i>

760
00:48:19.810 --> 00:48:22.344
I know. I'm just, I'm not
actually talking to you, Annie.

761
00:48:22.346 --> 00:48:23.812
Who are you talking to?

762
00:48:23.814 --> 00:48:25.715
I'm just gonna call you back,
all right?

763
00:48:25.717 --> 00:48:28.617
Thank you. Thank you, Dan.
Thank you. Thank you, both.

764
00:48:43.901 --> 00:48:45.367
Yeah?

765
00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:47.169
Hey, can you turn
your music down, please?

766
00:48:47.171 --> 00:48:48.904
'Cause I'm having
a really hard time.

767
00:48:48.906 --> 00:48:50.405
Whatever.

768
00:48:53.342 --> 00:48:55.342
Yeah, sure, man. Yeah.

769
00:48:55.344 --> 00:48:56.546
- I'll just turn it right down. Sorry.
- Thank you. Thank you.

770
00:48:59.783 --> 00:49:02.285
I was troubled by

771
00:49:03.319 --> 00:49:04.920
what we've been doing.

772
00:49:04.922 --> 00:49:06.722
I get it.

773
00:49:06.724 --> 00:49:07.991
I get it.

774
00:49:09.258 --> 00:49:10.692
We've all been troubled.

775
00:49:10.694 --> 00:49:13.262
It's the nature
of what we do.

776
00:49:14.898 --> 00:49:17.968
But I need you to tell me
who was here with you.

777
00:49:19.669 --> 00:49:20.970
I need that from you.

778
00:49:23.974 --> 00:49:26.507
I can't do that.

779
00:49:26.509 --> 00:49:29.947
We can't fix things
unless we begin with

780
00:49:30.814 --> 00:49:32.248
your friend.

781
00:49:33.583 --> 00:49:35.316
The person who was here.

782
00:49:35.318 --> 00:49:36.619
Because they're gonna die.
They're in grave danger.

783
00:49:37.621 --> 00:49:39.855
You know that, right?

784
00:49:39.857 --> 00:49:42.356
They're gonna die unless
we bring them back here,

785
00:49:42.358 --> 00:49:44.627
where you can help
to keep them alive.

786
00:49:47.663 --> 00:49:49.298
Hey. Dora.

787
00:49:50.900 --> 00:49:53.771
I promise, from here on in,
we will do things differently.

788
00:49:57.007 --> 00:49:58.307
Will you trust me?

789
00:50:05.281 --> 00:50:06.847
Eddie Brock.

790
00:50:06.849 --> 00:50:08.017
- Eddie Brock?
- Mmm-hmm.

791
00:50:17.660 --> 00:50:19.362
You were our best.

792
00:50:19.962 --> 00:50:21.695
Open it.

793
00:50:25.836 --> 00:50:27.035
No! No!

794
00:50:27.037 --> 00:50:29.270
No! No! No!

795
00:50:33.876 --> 00:50:35.645
<i>Do not open that door.</i>

796
00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.478
Huh?

797
00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.027
Stay put.

798
00:50:53.029 --> 00:50:54.895
- Hey, Eddie.
- <i>Who the hell is this guy?</i>

799
00:50:54.897 --> 00:50:57.364
I'm gonna need
Mr. Drake's property back.

800
00:50:57.366 --> 00:50:59.033
Whoa.

801
00:50:59.035 --> 00:51:01.802
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- I'm, uh...

802
00:51:01.804 --> 00:51:03.503
I'm putting my hands up.

803
00:51:03.505 --> 00:51:05.806
<i>You are making us
look bad.</i>

804
00:51:05.808 --> 00:51:08.776
I...
No, I am not.

805
00:51:08.778 --> 00:51:10.311
<i>Yes, you are.</i>

806
00:51:10.313 --> 00:51:11.711
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Yes, you are!</i>

807
00:51:11.713 --> 00:51:13.414
- No, I'm not.
- <i>Why would you do that?</i>

808
00:51:13.416 --> 00:51:15.415
'Cause it is
a very sensible thing to do.

809
00:51:15.417 --> 00:51:17.617
- Eddie...
- <i>I will take care of this myself.</i>

810
00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:19.519
- What?
- Eddie, where's the bug?

811
00:51:21.325 --> 00:51:22.124
Take him down.

812
00:51:33.501 --> 00:51:34.903
I'm so sorry
about your friends.

813
00:51:43.445 --> 00:51:46.115
- What is that?
- <i>Not "what." Who.</i>

814
00:51:47.816 --> 00:51:48.950
Oh.

815
00:51:58.460 --> 00:51:59.461
Shit.

816
00:52:21.383 --> 00:52:23.715
<i>Outstanding.</i>

817
00:52:23.717 --> 00:52:25.752
<i>Now let's bite all their heads off
and pile them up in the corner.</i>

818
00:52:25.754 --> 00:52:26.853
Why would we do that?

819
00:52:26.855 --> 00:52:29.658
<i>Pile of bodies, pile of heads.</i>

820
00:52:36.898 --> 00:52:38.499
What the shit, man?

821
00:52:44.172 --> 00:52:46.107
No! No, no, no!

822
00:52:52.881 --> 00:52:54.913
- What the hell?
- Dude! How did you do that?

823
00:52:54.915 --> 00:52:57.418
Apparently, I have a parasite.

824
00:53:05.860 --> 00:53:08.428
Mr. Drake, our subject
is carrying the Symbiote.

825
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:09.863
<i>Connecting you
to the feed now.</i>

826
00:53:15.036 --> 00:53:16.735
He's achieved symbiosis.

827
00:53:16.737 --> 00:53:18.171
Are you seeing this?

828
00:53:18.173 --> 00:53:20.174
Are you seeing this?
He's achieved symbiosis!

829
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:23.176
Treece...

830
00:53:23.178 --> 00:53:25.180
Treece, bring me back
my creature.

831
00:53:33.654 --> 00:53:34.888
<i>Eddie.</i>

832
00:53:44.564 --> 00:53:46.932
You're not even here, are you?
I'm just seeing things.

833
00:53:46.934 --> 00:53:49.034
It's not real.
You're in my head.

834
00:53:49.036 --> 00:53:50.602
'Cause you're just a parasite.

835
00:53:50.604 --> 00:53:51.638
"Parasite"?

836
00:53:58.846 --> 00:54:00.914
You have a brain tumor, Eddie.

837
00:54:04.752 --> 00:54:06.885
I got him. He's in the alley
behind the Schueller Building.

838
00:54:06.887 --> 00:54:08.686
I am sorry that I
called you a parasite.

839
00:54:08.688 --> 00:54:11.089
We can discuss this
like two men.

840
00:54:11.091 --> 00:54:12.593
What is that? What is that?

841
00:54:21.035 --> 00:54:23.101
What?

842
00:54:23.103 --> 00:54:25.570
Do not let him get away.
Do you understand me, Treece?

843
00:54:25.572 --> 00:54:28.106
<i>Copy.
Weapons are armed and ready.</i>

844
00:54:28.108 --> 00:54:29.209
Launch the drones.

845
00:54:58.571 --> 00:55:00.704
<i>Duck.</i>

846
00:55:02.076 --> 00:55:03.707
Whew!

847
00:55:03.709 --> 00:55:05.612
- Thank you.
- <i>You are welcome.</i>

848
00:55:11.651 --> 00:55:13.821
Oh!

849
00:55:21.962 --> 00:55:24.563
This is beyond
anything we thought was possible.

850
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:32.905
Oh, God, no!

851
00:55:55.128 --> 00:55:56.927
Holy shit!

852
00:56:04.170 --> 00:56:06.203
Treece, do not
let him get away.

853
00:56:06.205 --> 00:56:08.673
I've got him.
All ground vehicles, move in.

854
00:56:14.779 --> 00:56:16.915
Target is now eastbound
on Grant.

855
00:56:18.217 --> 00:56:19.719
Oh, God! Do something!

856
00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.261
What the...

857
00:56:34.934 --> 00:56:37.236
Oh, yeah! We got more friends.
Awesome.

858
00:56:41.407 --> 00:56:42.408
No, no, no! No, no!

859
00:56:45.777 --> 00:56:46.778
No! You're out of your mind!

860
00:56:48.847 --> 00:56:51.184
No!

861
00:57:11.036 --> 00:57:13.005
- That is a dead-end!
- <i>Not for us.</i>

862
00:57:14.706 --> 00:57:16.808
Whoa!

863
00:57:22.981 --> 00:57:23.982
Yeah!

864
00:57:53.945 --> 00:57:55.113
Whoa!

865
00:58:01.953 --> 00:58:03.386
I am going to die!

866
00:58:03.388 --> 00:58:04.823
<i>You are not
going to die!</i>

867
00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.204
Whoa! That was pretty cool,
actually. I'm not gonna lie...

868
00:58:28.747 --> 00:58:30.012
I got him.

869
00:58:30.014 --> 00:58:31.079
- <i>Bring him home.</i>
- Copy that.

870
00:58:31.081 --> 00:58:33.018
This is incredible.

871
00:58:39.323 --> 00:58:42.225
You have been a serious
pain in the ass for me, Eddie.

872
00:58:42.227 --> 00:58:45.263
Well, you know,
I aim to please.

873
00:58:57.075 --> 00:59:01.043
Eyes, lungs, pancreas.

874
00:59:01.045 --> 00:59:03.514
So many snacks,
so little time.

875
00:59:14.159 --> 00:59:16.091
SFPD. Don't move!

876
00:59:16.093 --> 00:59:17.261
Get off the car!

877
00:59:34.044 --> 00:59:35.079
My legs.

878
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:39.214
Oh, my God,
my legs were broken.

879
00:59:39.216 --> 00:59:41.618
Now they're not broken.
What is happening?

880
00:59:56.967 --> 00:59:58.899
What the hell
are you?

881
00:59:58.901 --> 01:00:01.370
I am Venom.

882
01:00:01.372 --> 01:00:04.139
And you are mine.

883
01:00:04.141 --> 01:00:06.508
You bit somebody's head off.

884
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:08.577
Fuel in the tank.

885
01:00:08.579 --> 01:00:10.847
Listen carefully, Eddie.

886
01:00:10.849 --> 01:00:13.081
You did not find us.

887
01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:15.883
We found you.

888
01:00:15.885 --> 01:00:17.919
Think of yourself
as my ride.

889
01:00:17.921 --> 01:00:19.187
Where are you going?

890
01:00:19.189 --> 01:00:22.290
We need
Carlton Drake's rocket.

891
01:00:22.292 --> 01:00:24.258
You remember him.

892
01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.660
How do you even know
about that?

893
01:00:25.662 --> 01:00:28.163
- I know everything, Eddie.
- You do?

894
01:00:28.165 --> 01:00:29.997
- Everything about you.
- How?

895
01:00:29.999 --> 01:00:32.433
I am inside your head.

896
01:00:32.435 --> 01:00:35.003
You are a loser, Eddie.

897
01:00:39.575 --> 01:00:42.344
Are you gonna eat
anybody else?

898
01:00:42.346 --> 01:00:43.645
Most likely.

899
01:00:43.647 --> 01:00:45.112
Oh, God.

900
01:00:45.114 --> 01:00:48.115
That is why we are here.

901
01:00:48.117 --> 01:00:51.422
Cooperate,
and you might just survive.

902
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:54.691
That is the deal.

903
01:00:58.195 --> 01:00:59.528
<i>Good
evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

904
01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.429
<i>Welcome to San Francisco.</i>

905
01:01:01.431 --> 01:01:03.332
<i>For your safety and comfort,
please remain seated...</i>

906
01:01:24.387 --> 01:01:26.153
Hey, babe. I'm almost home.

907
01:01:26.155 --> 01:01:27.987
- <i>Where's Eddie?</i>
- Why? What's happening?

908
01:01:27.989 --> 01:01:30.059
I got Eddie's labs back,

909
01:01:31.461 --> 01:01:33.394
and it's worse than I thought.

910
01:01:33.396 --> 01:01:36.564
His systems, renal, endocrine,
they're behaving abnormally.

911
01:01:36.566 --> 01:01:38.299
<i>I've never seen
anything like it.</i>

912
01:01:38.301 --> 01:01:40.100
What does that mean, Dan?
What are you telling me?

913
01:01:40.102 --> 01:01:41.968
- You need to get him here.
- <i>My God.</i>

914
01:01:45.709 --> 01:01:47.543
- <i>Eddie Brock here. Leave a message.</i>
- Shit.

915
01:01:54.083 --> 01:01:57.418
Where were you when
it left Dr. Skirth's body?

916
01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:59.587
- Where was he?
- I was...

917
01:01:59.589 --> 01:02:03.593
This is the higher life-form. You
stood by and watched while it died.

918
01:02:04.627 --> 01:02:05.661
The arrogance.

919
01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:15.636
Treece, listen to me. After this,
we can't risk killing Brock,

920
01:02:15.638 --> 01:02:18.005
not until we find
another suitable host.

921
01:02:18.007 --> 01:02:22.408
I don't want to see you again
unless you have Brock!

922
01:02:27.116 --> 01:02:29.416
Officer, what's happening?
I need to get in there.

923
01:02:29.418 --> 01:02:31.518
- It's my friend's apartment.
- Building's been evacuated.

924
01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:32.585
It's not safe for you
to be here, ma'am.

925
01:02:32.587 --> 01:02:34.522
Found another one, Bill.

926
01:02:34.524 --> 01:02:36.423
Get off the streets.
Go home.

927
01:02:36.425 --> 01:02:38.124
There's bodies
all over the city tonight.

928
01:02:38.126 --> 01:02:39.160
Bodies?

929
01:02:40.595 --> 01:02:42.565
My God, Eddie,
where are you?

930
01:02:45.567 --> 01:02:47.534
<i>Who is Anne?
Your pulse has quickened.</i>

931
01:02:47.536 --> 01:02:49.470
That is none of your
goddamn business.

932
01:02:49.472 --> 01:02:52.038
<i>Everything of yours
is my business, Eddie.</i>

933
01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:53.606
<i>We have no secrets.</i>

934
01:02:53.608 --> 01:02:55.241
Yeah? Well, then you know
exactly why I'm going here

935
01:02:55.243 --> 01:02:56.744
before we get to your rocket,
huh?

936
01:02:56.746 --> 01:03:00.280
<i>Sure.
I'm not unreasonable.</i>

937
01:03:00.282 --> 01:03:02.081
Shit. Yeah?

938
01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:04.049
Eddie. Thank God. Where are you?
I need to see you.

939
01:03:04.051 --> 01:03:05.786
No, no, you can't see me.

940
01:03:05.788 --> 01:03:08.087
Eddie, I need you to tell me where you are.
I'm coming to get you.

941
01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:09.656
No, you cannot come
anywhere near me.

942
01:03:09.658 --> 01:03:12.225
You cannot come
near me right now.

943
01:03:12.227 --> 01:03:14.028
- Richard. Hey, Richard...
- <i>No!</i>

944
01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:15.528
- Eddie?
- <i>No, I gotta go up there.</i>

945
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:16.563
You know you're not
supposed to be here, Eddie.

946
01:03:16.565 --> 01:03:18.064
I got to get up there, man.

947
01:03:18.066 --> 01:03:20.132
Look, I got love for you, bro,
but no can do.

948
01:03:20.134 --> 01:03:21.502
There's no such thing
as can't.

949
01:03:21.504 --> 01:03:22.672
I'm sorry, man.

950
01:03:23.605 --> 01:03:26.105
Okay, okay... Uh...

951
01:03:26.107 --> 01:03:28.408
Can you, uh,
just give him this?

952
01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:31.344
- He needs to see what's on it.
- Eddie, please. I really need this job.

953
01:03:31.346 --> 01:03:33.646
- <i>Let's eat his brains.</i>
- No! You do not touch him!

954
01:03:33.648 --> 01:03:35.648
- He is my friend.
- What's wrong with you?

955
01:03:35.650 --> 01:03:37.718
He works three jobs just so
that he can support his family.

956
01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.218
- Eddie, what's going on?
- We're leaving.

957
01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:40.753
- <i>"We"?</i>
- Yeah.

958
01:03:40.755 --> 01:03:42.324
- What are you talking about, "we"?
- Just stay back!

959
01:03:44.525 --> 01:03:46.361
Yeah.

960
01:03:52.232 --> 01:03:54.669
- Shit.
- <i>You want up?</i>

961
01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:00.776
<i>Well, why didn't you just say?</i>

962
01:04:11.586 --> 01:04:14.119
Hmm.

963
01:04:14.121 --> 01:04:17.323
- It is peaceful up here.
- <i>I'm not very good with heights.</i>

964
01:04:17.325 --> 01:04:21.527
Your world is not so ugly
after all.

965
01:04:21.529 --> 01:04:24.097
I'm almost sorry
to see it end.

966
01:04:24.099 --> 01:04:25.264
<i>What does that mean?</i>

967
01:04:33.541 --> 01:04:35.240
Where'd you go?
Where did you go?

968
01:04:46.153 --> 01:04:47.552
<i>I got us.</i>

969
01:04:47.554 --> 01:04:48.657
Whoa.

970
01:04:54.129 --> 01:04:57.697
Again?
You're gonna get me killed.

971
01:04:57.699 --> 01:04:59.832
<i>You die, I die.</i>

972
01:04:59.834 --> 01:05:02.234
Yeah, well, you can always
just shed my carcass

973
01:05:02.236 --> 01:05:04.737
and exchange it for another
one whenever you need.

974
01:05:04.739 --> 01:05:06.639
<i>Why would I do that?</i>

975
01:05:06.641 --> 01:05:09.641
<i>You are far too good of a
match to throw away so soon.</i>

976
01:05:09.643 --> 01:05:11.810
<i>Plus, I am starting
to like you.</i>

977
01:05:11.812 --> 01:05:13.280
<i>You and I
are not so different.</i>

978
01:05:13.882 --> 01:05:14.949
Thank you.

979
01:05:18.819 --> 01:05:19.853
Okay.

980
01:05:21.823 --> 01:05:23.323
Here's your evidence.

981
01:05:27.260 --> 01:05:28.461
<i>Jump.</i>

982
01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:32.631
<i>Pussy.</i>

983
01:05:42.743 --> 01:05:43.877
Hands!

984
01:05:45.813 --> 01:05:47.548
On the ground! Now!

985
01:05:51.952 --> 01:05:54.786
Guys, you do not want to do this.
Trust me.

986
01:05:54.788 --> 01:05:56.855
- Mask!
- Copy!

987
01:05:56.857 --> 01:05:59.356
All right,
have it your own way.

988
01:05:59.358 --> 01:06:01.226
- Mask!
- <i>Copy.</i>

989
01:06:01.228 --> 01:06:02.761
What the hell
is that thing?

990
01:06:08.367 --> 01:06:09.536
What the hell?

991
01:06:10.771 --> 01:06:12.369
Hold your fire!

992
01:06:12.371 --> 01:06:14.505
Flares!

993
01:06:14.507 --> 01:06:15.606
He's there!
He's there!

994
01:06:15.608 --> 01:06:16.810
Reload!

995
01:06:17.911 --> 01:06:19.644
Anybody see him?

996
01:06:30.556 --> 01:06:32.490
Does anyone have eyes on him?

997
01:06:34.228 --> 01:06:36.329
<i>Switching to
thermal. Seeking target.</i>

998
01:06:49.943 --> 01:06:51.675
I don't have
eyes on him.

999
01:06:53.379 --> 01:06:54.447
Where is it?

1000
01:07:01.454 --> 01:07:02.553
Flash grenade!

1001
01:07:03.823 --> 01:07:04.956
Throw them!

1002
01:07:04.958 --> 01:07:06.490
Flash grenade!

1003
01:07:17.537 --> 01:07:18.803
He's in the rafters!

1004
01:07:18.805 --> 01:07:19.870
Above!

1005
01:07:25.311 --> 01:07:26.344
There he is!

1006
01:07:30.983 --> 01:07:32.418
Move, move, move!

1007
01:08:02.381 --> 01:08:04.081
<i>No! We do not
eat policemen!</i>

1008
01:08:10.456 --> 01:08:11.956
Annie! Annie, wait!

1009
01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:13.790
- Wait, please.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

1010
01:08:13.792 --> 01:08:16.460
That's not me.
I've been infected.

1011
01:08:16.462 --> 01:08:18.929
- Eddie, what's happening?
- He's inside me.

1012
01:08:18.931 --> 01:08:20.530
- "He"?
- Yes.

1013
01:08:20.532 --> 01:08:22.966
- I know it sounds crazy, but...
- You're sick.

1014
01:08:22.968 --> 01:08:25.671
- Eddie, you're really sick.
- No, I am scared!

1015
01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:30.742
- And I need help.
- Hospital.

1016
01:08:34.512 --> 01:08:35.513
Right now.

1017
01:08:38.717 --> 01:08:41.517
I can't go with you.
It's not safe.

1018
01:08:41.519 --> 01:08:42.587
Get in the car, Eddie.

1019
01:08:44.689 --> 01:08:47.759
- In the back.
- <i>I like her. Get in.</i>

1020
01:08:54.833 --> 01:08:56.936
I'm out of control.

1021
01:08:58.603 --> 01:09:00.104
Dan just needs to do
another MRI.

1022
01:09:00.106 --> 01:09:01.940
- <i>No MRI.</i>
- No. No. No MRI.

1023
01:09:02.641 --> 01:09:04.375
What? Why?

1024
01:09:04.377 --> 01:09:06.476
<i>Sound at 4,000
to 6,000 hertz is lethal.</i>

1025
01:09:08.046 --> 01:09:11.814
Sound frequency in the MRI
is really harmful for him.

1026
01:09:11.816 --> 01:09:14.617
What, so, sound
is like his kryptonite?

1027
01:09:14.619 --> 01:09:17.419
- Not all sounds.
- <i>And fire.</i>

1028
01:09:17.421 --> 01:09:20.458
- Fire. And fire.
- He's talking to you?

1029
01:09:22.061 --> 01:09:23.495
Always.

1030
01:09:24.596 --> 01:09:26.763
- Are you in pain?
- No.

1031
01:09:26.765 --> 01:09:29.465
No, I don't feel anything,
actually, apart from...

1032
01:09:29.467 --> 01:09:31.768
I'm hungry all the time.

1033
01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:35.106
<i>And you feel sad, do you
not, Eddie, when you are with her?</i>

1034
01:09:36.409 --> 01:09:38.107
Get out of my head, man.

1035
01:09:38.109 --> 01:09:40.576
<i>You never apologized.</i>

1036
01:09:40.578 --> 01:09:43.181
<i>You might not live
to get another chance.</i>

1037
01:09:49.054 --> 01:09:50.886
Annie.

1038
01:09:50.888 --> 01:09:54.557
I just want to say
that whatever happens,

1039
01:09:54.559 --> 01:10:00.563
that I am truly sorry for whatever...
And everything I have ever done to you.

1040
01:10:00.565 --> 01:10:02.167
I am truly, truly sorry.

1041
01:10:03.567 --> 01:10:05.636
And that I love you.

1042
01:10:06.204 --> 01:10:08.838
Oh, Eddie...

1043
01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.941
Now's really not the time. Let's
just keep you alive, okay?

1044
01:10:11.943 --> 01:10:14.576
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>

1045
01:10:17.782 --> 01:10:22.684
You know, I'm really wet and
cold. Can I, uh, wear this?

1046
01:10:22.686 --> 01:10:25.888
Yeah, yeah, you can wear
whatever you want.

1047
01:10:25.890 --> 01:10:26.958
Thank you.

1048
01:10:45.576 --> 01:10:46.610
Hello?

1049
01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:59.157
What are you doing here?

1050
01:11:02.860 --> 01:11:03.861
Are you lost?

1051
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:08.032
I'm not lost.

1052
01:11:15.606 --> 01:11:17.105
Thanks for coming in.

1053
01:11:17.107 --> 01:11:20.609
- Eddie, I'm sorry.
- What?

1054
01:11:20.611 --> 01:11:23.513
Eddie, I got your labs back, and
your heart has atrophied severely.

1055
01:11:23.515 --> 01:11:26.014
<i>Do not listen to him.
I can fix it.</i>

1056
01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:27.548
I don't want you to fix it.

1057
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:28.884
<i>I can heal you.</i>

1058
01:11:31.088 --> 01:11:32.788
Can you fix it?

1059
01:11:32.790 --> 01:11:34.722
No. I've never seen
anything like this before.

1060
01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:36.925
- This parasite, whatever this is...
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>

1061
01:11:36.927 --> 01:11:38.226
It's eating you
from the inside.

1062
01:11:38.228 --> 01:11:39.861
Not a parasite.
He's not.

1063
01:11:39.863 --> 01:11:41.963
- You're using him up.
- <i>No. She is wrong.</i>

1064
01:11:41.965 --> 01:11:45.000
- We need to get you to the ICU.
- Wait. Shh!

1065
01:11:45.002 --> 01:11:47.601
- I, Eddie, am I dying?
- <i>No!</i>

1066
01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:49.204
You're killing him.

1067
01:11:49.206 --> 01:11:50.671
<i>They do not know
what they are talking about.</i>

1068
01:11:50.673 --> 01:11:52.240
Listen,
we don't have a lot of time...

1069
01:11:52.242 --> 01:11:53.775
- Oh, God!
- <i>We have to get out of here.</i>

1070
01:11:55.112 --> 01:11:56.178
- Stop!
- Oh, God, he's killing you.

1071
01:11:56.180 --> 01:11:57.546
I'm killing you.
I'm so sorry.

1072
01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:02.886
No! Don't do that!

1073
01:12:18.068 --> 01:12:21.102
Are you all right? Eddie, I'm sorry.
I had to get him out of you.

1074
01:12:21.104 --> 01:12:22.603
What is that?

1075
01:12:29.346 --> 01:12:32.314
You were killing me?

1076
01:12:32.316 --> 01:12:35.385
What happened to "we," man?
What happened to "we"?

1077
01:12:37.220 --> 01:12:41.891
Yeah, look at you now, huh?
Now you're dying, too.

1078
01:12:43.126 --> 01:12:44.260
We're done.

1079
01:12:46.628 --> 01:12:48.997
- Where do you think you're going?
- Anywhere other than here.

1080
01:12:48.999 --> 01:12:50.764
You don't think we have
a little problem on our hands?

1081
01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.768
Wait, you're not gonna
leave me here with this thing.

1082
01:12:55.704 --> 01:12:57.239
You want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

1083
01:12:57.241 --> 01:13:01.142
I do. And you're right.
We do need to talk about it,

1084
01:13:01.144 --> 01:13:03.377
but I don't know
much more than you do.

1085
01:13:03.379 --> 01:13:06.348
I guess he had
no one else to turn to.

1086
01:13:06.350 --> 01:13:10.084
He's a very complicated man.
But, Dan, I promise,

1087
01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:11.818
there's nothing going on
between me and Eddie.

1088
01:13:11.820 --> 01:13:13.954
I'm not talking
about you and Eddie, Anne.

1089
01:13:13.956 --> 01:13:15.224
- Oh.
- I'm talking about that.

1090
01:13:19.028 --> 01:13:20.028
Dan.

1091
01:13:26.868 --> 01:13:28.103
Where is it?

1092
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:56.032
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie.

1093
01:14:22.157 --> 01:14:25.858
You can kill me,
'cause I'm dying anyway.

1094
01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:30.463
I'm not just gonna kill you.
That wouldn't be any fun.

1095
01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:34.734
No, no, no. I'm gonna rip your
tongue out of your face.

1096
01:14:34.736 --> 01:14:37.036
Whoo!

1097
01:14:38.707 --> 01:14:42.376
Stop. You're bleeding
all over my lab. Go. Go!

1098
01:14:51.953 --> 01:14:54.020
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1099
01:14:54.022 --> 01:14:57.056
And you know what? Even if I
did, I wouldn't tell you anyway.

1100
01:14:57.058 --> 01:15:00.960
I don't trust you,
and you're insane.

1101
01:15:00.962 --> 01:15:02.894
- That hurts.
- Sorry.

1102
01:15:02.896 --> 01:15:04.365
Long journal entry
about that tonight.

1103
01:15:04.367 --> 01:15:06.132
You're being dumb, Brock.
I'm not insane.

1104
01:15:06.134 --> 01:15:09.302
What's insane is the way
humans choose to live today.

1105
01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:11.870
Think about it.
All we do is take, take, take.

1106
01:15:11.872 --> 01:15:13.306
It can't go on.

1107
01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:15.842
We've brought the planet
to the brink of extinction.

1108
01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.843
We're parasites.
You're a good example.

1109
01:15:17.845 --> 01:15:19.746
Think about it.
All you do is take.

1110
01:15:19.748 --> 01:15:23.449
You took my Symbiote. You
take potshots at a great man

1111
01:15:23.451 --> 01:15:25.251
- trying to get something done.
- Who?

1112
01:15:27.187 --> 01:15:29.455
Didn't you take from the
person you loved the most,

1113
01:15:29.457 --> 01:15:31.958
who trusted you the most?
That's insane.

1114
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:36.462
What I've initiated is a whole
new world, a new species.

1115
01:15:36.464 --> 01:15:38.898
Man and Symbiote combined.

1116
01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:41.467
Let me tell you something, buddy.
All right? Just man-to-man.

1117
01:15:41.469 --> 01:15:44.537
Because I have spent a significant
amount of time, all right,

1118
01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:47.939
with one of these creatures
up my ass.

1119
01:15:47.941 --> 01:15:49.241
It's not a lot of fun.

1120
01:15:49.243 --> 01:15:51.843
And then I find out,
all along,

1121
01:15:51.845 --> 01:15:53.246
that they're killing you.

1122
01:15:53.248 --> 01:15:54.980
This is the last time
I'm asking you.

1123
01:15:54.982 --> 01:15:57.517
- Where is my Symbiote?
- I have no idea.

1124
01:15:57.519 --> 01:16:00.053
- Where is he?
- Oh, my God!

1125
01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.788
Where's Venom?

1126
01:16:01.790 --> 01:16:05.357
That is the ugliest-looking
thing I have ever seen.

1127
01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:15.233
You know, Brock,
I have no use for you.

1128
01:16:15.235 --> 01:16:17.903
Treece! Come and clean up
your mess.

1129
01:16:17.905 --> 01:16:22.140
Whoa, he has one
up his ass, too.

1130
01:16:30.384 --> 01:16:35.822
Your friends, the others, I apologize.
I tried to keep them alive.

1131
01:16:35.824 --> 01:16:39.224
There are more of us.
Millions more.

1132
01:16:39.226 --> 01:16:41.429
They will follow
wherever I lead.

1133
01:16:43.464 --> 01:16:45.230
Where we lead.

1134
01:16:45.232 --> 01:16:46.964
Yes, "we."

1135
01:16:46.966 --> 01:16:50.237
But first,
we must retrieve them.

1136
01:16:51.605 --> 01:16:53.173
I can take care of that.

1137
01:16:58.212 --> 01:17:01.213
Yeah, what you gonna do,
you gonna walk me to death?

1138
01:17:01.215 --> 01:17:02.216
Shut up.

1139
01:17:06.053 --> 01:17:07.886
Not so tough
without your friend.

1140
01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.228
Did your mama not love you?

1141
01:17:17.131 --> 01:17:18.597
God damn it!

1142
01:17:20.467 --> 01:17:23.635
I guess it
pays to be a specialist, huh?

1143
01:17:23.637 --> 01:17:25.637
You know, it doesn't matter
if you kill me anyway,

1144
01:17:25.639 --> 01:17:27.405
because there's something
way bigger afoot

1145
01:17:27.407 --> 01:17:28.475
in this world than you and me.

1146
01:17:29.410 --> 01:17:31.643
Much bigger than me.

1147
01:17:31.645 --> 01:17:36.150
And it's much,
much bigger than you.

1148
01:17:38.519 --> 01:17:40.352
Karma's a bitch.

1149
01:17:40.354 --> 01:17:41.588
I don't believe in karma.

1150
01:17:43.322 --> 01:17:45.325
Oh! Ooh!

1151
01:17:50.029 --> 01:17:51.095
Hi, Eddie.

1152
01:17:51.097 --> 01:17:53.131
Whoa. Whoa...

1153
01:17:53.133 --> 01:17:55.966
Oh...

1154
01:17:55.968 --> 01:17:56.969
Mmm...

1155
01:17:58.004 --> 01:17:59.205
Mmm!

1156
01:18:15.455 --> 01:18:16.623
Oh, no.

1157
01:18:18.224 --> 01:18:20.624
I just bit
that guy's head off.

1158
01:18:20.626 --> 01:18:23.127
I know, I know. I've been there, too.
It's not fun.

1159
01:18:23.129 --> 01:18:25.963
- <i>The one with Drake is Riot.</i>
- Who's Riot?

1160
01:18:25.965 --> 01:18:28.466
<i>Riot is what you would call
a team leader.</i>

1161
01:18:28.468 --> 01:18:30.534
<i>He has an arsenal of weapons.</i>

1162
01:18:30.536 --> 01:18:32.970
- Drake's got his own Symbiote.
- <i>He is unstoppable.</i>

1163
01:18:32.972 --> 01:18:34.538
- Oh, great.
- <i>We have got to go!</i>

1164
01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:36.240
Go where? Where we going?

1165
01:18:36.242 --> 01:18:37.675
- Well, I'm coming with you.
- <i>No!</i>

1166
01:18:37.677 --> 01:18:39.577
<i>It's going to get ugly.</i>

1167
01:18:39.579 --> 01:18:41.682
- Well, she can fight ugly. Trust me.
- Yeah, I can fight ugly.

1168
01:18:43.449 --> 01:18:45.017
Not today.

1169
01:18:46.486 --> 01:18:48.087
Oh, that's bullshit!

1170
01:18:50.256 --> 01:18:51.989
This is not a simulation.

1171
01:18:51.991 --> 01:18:54.157
Well, the flight team
aren't prepped yet.

1172
01:18:54.159 --> 01:18:56.595
I'll be piloting
the spacecraft.

1173
01:18:56.597 --> 01:18:58.329
- You?
- Yes, me.

1174
01:18:58.331 --> 01:19:00.030
How long?

1175
01:19:00.032 --> 01:19:01.732
We're loading the probe
and running diagnostics.

1176
01:19:01.734 --> 01:19:05.104
But even fully automated, you
can't pilot that craft all alone.

1177
01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:08.441
I'm not alone.

1178
01:19:12.078 --> 01:19:15.379
God damn it! What the hell
happened there? We just left Annie.

1179
01:19:15.381 --> 01:19:17.348
<i>It is not safe for her.</i>

1180
01:19:17.350 --> 01:19:18.983
<i>If we do not stop Riot,</i>

1181
01:19:18.985 --> 01:19:22.386
<i>he will come back here
with millions more of my kind.</i>

1182
01:19:22.388 --> 01:19:26.757
Millions? What, you were
gonna take the rocket,

1183
01:19:26.759 --> 01:19:29.026
and you were gonna come back
here with an invasion force?

1184
01:19:29.028 --> 01:19:30.728
Then what were you gonna do,
you were gonna go feed

1185
01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:32.496
- on a whole planet?
- <i>Yes!</i>

1186
01:19:32.498 --> 01:19:34.698
<i>But it is
different now, Eddie.</i>

1187
01:19:34.700 --> 01:19:37.268
- <i>I have decided to stay.</i>
- Wow!

1188
01:19:37.270 --> 01:19:40.303
<i>On my planet, I am
kind of a loser, like you.</i>

1189
01:19:40.305 --> 01:19:43.039
- <i>But here, we could be more.</i>
- Excuse me?

1190
01:19:43.041 --> 01:19:44.775
<i>And I'm getting to
like it here.</i>

1191
01:19:44.777 --> 01:19:47.444
Oh, you like us now,
do you, huh?

1192
01:19:47.446 --> 01:19:50.079
<i>However, there will be nothing left to
like if we do not stop that rocket.</i>

1193
01:19:50.081 --> 01:19:54.083
Oh, I see. Right. When it comes
to being completely annihilated,

1194
01:19:54.085 --> 01:19:56.185
- then it's back to "we."
- <i>It is "we."</i>

1195
01:19:56.187 --> 01:19:58.588
<i>Like it or not, it is
going to take both of us.</i>

1196
01:19:58.590 --> 01:20:00.291
Hey, come on, man.
Cut the bullshit.

1197
01:20:00.293 --> 01:20:01.761
What really made you
change your mind?

1198
01:20:05.564 --> 01:20:08.534
You. You did, Eddie.

1199
01:20:10.536 --> 01:20:13.202
Scrub diagnostics.

1200
01:20:13.204 --> 01:20:15.574
- Sir?
- Did you hear me? Initiate the launch.

1201
01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.348
<i>T-minus
five minutes to launch.</i>

1202
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:27.686
<i>Auto sequence has been
initiated.</i>

1203
01:20:40.398 --> 01:20:41.767
Oh, shit.

1204
01:20:51.343 --> 01:20:54.278
<i>T-minus
four minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1205
01:21:01.753 --> 01:21:05.521
<i>Oh, Jesus!
You can take this guy, right?</i>

1206
01:21:05.523 --> 01:21:08.223
He has got shit
you have never seen.

1207
01:21:08.225 --> 01:21:10.325
<i>What does that mean?
What are our chances?</i>

1208
01:21:10.327 --> 01:21:13.763
Hmm. Pretty much zero.

1209
01:21:13.765 --> 01:21:16.668
<i>Oh, fuck it. Well,
let's go save the planet.</i>

1210
01:21:19.670 --> 01:21:21.773
<i>T-minus four minutes.</i>

1211
01:21:25.476 --> 01:21:28.279
<i>Initiate orbiter
aerosurface profile.</i>

1212
01:21:31.549 --> 01:21:34.383
Venom. Get in the rocket.

1213
01:21:34.385 --> 01:21:38.521
No. We won't let you destroy
this world.

1214
01:21:38.523 --> 01:21:39.856
Then die.

1215
01:21:50.601 --> 01:21:52.602
- <i>Holy shit!</i>
- Told you.

1216
01:21:52.604 --> 01:21:54.238
<i>T-minus three minutes.</i>

1217
01:22:06.684 --> 01:22:08.218
You have a strong host.

1218
01:22:10.487 --> 01:22:11.822
But not strong enough.

1219
01:22:50.594 --> 01:22:53.327
<i>T-minus
two minutes, 30 seconds.</i>

1220
01:22:55.531 --> 01:22:56.667
Eddie.

1221
01:23:01.205 --> 01:23:02.572
Drake, stop!

1222
01:24:08.839 --> 01:24:11.307
Told you I could fight ugly.

1223
01:24:18.447 --> 01:24:20.750
<i>T-minus one minute.</i>

1224
01:24:38.734 --> 01:24:40.434
You're too late.

1225
01:24:40.436 --> 01:24:41.437
This is the next stage...

1226
01:24:43.506 --> 01:24:45.741
You talk too much.

1227
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:57.319
<i>T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

1228
01:24:57.321 --> 01:24:58.955
You are nothing.

1229
01:25:27.617 --> 01:25:28.918
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1230
01:25:29.685 --> 01:25:30.820
<i>Nine...</i>

1231
01:25:31.653 --> 01:25:32.721
<i>Eight...</i>

1232
01:25:33.655 --> 01:25:34.656
<i>Seven...</i>

1233
01:25:35.423 --> 01:25:36.424
<i>Six...</i>

1234
01:25:36.959 --> 01:25:37.994
<i>Five...</i>

1235
01:25:38.794 --> 01:25:40.426
<i>Four...</i>

1236
01:25:40.428 --> 01:25:41.961
<i>Three...</i>

1237
01:25:41.963 --> 01:25:43.831
<i>Two...</i>

1238
01:25:43.833 --> 01:25:45.835
<i>One...</i>

1239
01:25:47.636 --> 01:25:48.803
<i>Liftoff.</i>

1240
01:25:56.145 --> 01:25:57.777
Traitor!

1241
01:25:57.779 --> 01:25:59.547
Have a nice life.

1242
01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.208
<i>Goodbye, Eddie.</i>

1243
01:26:28.476 --> 01:26:29.911
Venom, no!

1244
01:27:17.958 --> 01:27:21.928
Thanks for sticking by me, Annie.
Thanks for saving me.

1245
01:27:21.930 --> 01:27:23.528
So, how you feeling
after all that?

1246
01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.497
I feel great. Awesome.

1247
01:27:25.499 --> 01:27:27.500
Wow.

1248
01:27:27.502 --> 01:27:29.168
Yeah, I'm thinking of suing, though.
You want to prosecute?

1249
01:27:29.170 --> 01:27:32.671
Hmm. You're in luck. I've
decided to work pro bono.

1250
01:27:32.673 --> 01:27:34.673
I'm joining
the public defenders' office.

1251
01:27:34.675 --> 01:27:36.641
You're a good person, Annie.

1252
01:27:36.643 --> 01:27:38.144
What about you?
What are you gonna do?

1253
01:27:38.146 --> 01:27:39.978
Uh, the network asked me
to bring the show back,

1254
01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:42.014
and they want to start
with a piece on Drake.

1255
01:27:42.016 --> 01:27:44.117
Oh, wow, really?
So, what did you say?

1256
01:27:44.119 --> 01:27:48.553
Uh, I'm not into it. I want to
concentrate on the written word.

1257
01:27:48.555 --> 01:27:50.655
I scored the interview
of a lifetime.

1258
01:27:50.657 --> 01:27:52.992
- Oh, yeah? Who?
- You're gonna have to read it.

1259
01:27:52.994 --> 01:27:55.627
Oh! Like everyone else.

1260
01:27:55.629 --> 01:27:56.630
Yeah.

1261
01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:01.302
Hey, I'm sorry about Venom.

1262
01:28:03.003 --> 01:28:04.204
Hey, um...

1263
01:28:06.874 --> 01:28:08.707
Do you want to talk
about that kiss?

1264
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:11.912
Oh, that? You call that a kiss...
No, that was...

1265
01:28:13.546 --> 01:28:17.283
Uh, that was your
buddy's idea.

1266
01:28:17.285 --> 01:28:19.686
Oh, right. Well,
that is good to know.

1267
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:24.558
- It did feel kind of great, though.
- What?

1268
01:28:25.192 --> 01:28:26.625
I mean, the...

1269
01:28:26.627 --> 01:28:30.162
- The power?
- Yeah. When it's, you know...

1270
01:28:30.164 --> 01:28:31.730
- Inside you?
- You know what I mean.

1271
01:28:31.732 --> 01:28:32.833
Okay.

1272
01:28:34.134 --> 01:28:35.734
- Hey, Eddie?
- Mmm-hmm?

1273
01:28:35.736 --> 01:28:37.969
We're not gonna
tell Dan about this. Okay?

1274
01:28:37.971 --> 01:28:41.706
<i>Look at her. She has no
idea we are going to get her back.</i>

1275
01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:44.642
No, I don't think so.

1276
01:28:44.644 --> 01:28:47.111
- Sorry, what was that?
- We're not gonna tell Dan.

1277
01:28:47.113 --> 01:28:48.914
Eddie, is there something
you want to tell me?

1278
01:28:48.916 --> 01:28:51.550
- Nope.
- <i>You belong with us, Annie.</i>

1279
01:28:51.552 --> 01:28:53.085
Eddie, are you sure?

1280
01:28:53.087 --> 01:28:55.086
Good Lord, look at that.

1281
01:28:55.088 --> 01:28:57.224
- Look at the time.
- I have to go.

1282
01:28:58.992 --> 01:29:01.159
- Hey, it's nice seeing you.
- Yeah.

1283
01:29:01.161 --> 01:29:03.563
You take care, all right?

1284
01:29:03.565 --> 01:29:05.365
- Yeah, you take care of yourself.
- Bye.

1285
01:29:09.303 --> 01:29:12.737
Hey. Don't give up on her.

1286
01:29:12.739 --> 01:29:13.907
Either of you.

1287
01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:16.006
We won't.

1288
01:29:16.008 --> 01:29:17.708
- <i>Who is that guy?</i>
- Okay.

1289
01:29:17.710 --> 01:29:20.278
<i>Wait.
This thing looks delicious.</i>

1290
01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:22.947
I have absolutely no problem
with you sticking around,

1291
01:29:22.949 --> 01:29:25.883
but if you do, we're gonna have to
have some ground rules, all right?

1292
01:29:25.885 --> 01:29:29.653
You cannot just go around eating
anybody that you want to.

1293
01:29:29.655 --> 01:29:31.622
- <i>I cannot?</i>
- No, you cannot.

1294
01:29:31.624 --> 01:29:33.324
All right, we need to...
We need to reiterate this.

1295
01:29:33.326 --> 01:29:36.895
There are good people
in this world, a lot of them.

1296
01:29:36.897 --> 01:29:39.197
And then there are bad people.

1297
01:29:39.199 --> 01:29:41.065
You have to tell
the difference.

1298
01:29:41.067 --> 01:29:44.935
The deal is, you will only
ever be allowed to touch,

1299
01:29:44.937 --> 01:29:48.305
harm, hurt, possibly,
very possibly,

1300
01:29:48.307 --> 01:29:50.740
eat very, very bad people,

1301
01:29:50.742 --> 01:29:53.644
but never, ever,
ever good people. All right?

1302
01:29:53.646 --> 01:29:56.013
- <i>Fine.</i>
- Good.

1303
01:29:56.015 --> 01:29:57.781
<i>But how does one
tell the difference?</i>

1304
01:29:57.783 --> 01:29:59.884
Well, it's super simple.

1305
01:29:59.886 --> 01:30:02.786
I mean, you just have to... You
can intuit it, you can sense it.

1306
01:30:02.788 --> 01:30:04.855
Sometimes you can
even feel it.

1307
01:30:04.857 --> 01:30:06.290
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

1308
01:30:06.292 --> 01:30:08.360
<i>But can we get something to
eat now?</i>

1309
01:30:08.362 --> 01:30:13.796
<i>Otherwise, your liver, it's starting
to look really, really good and juicy.</i>

1310
01:30:13.798 --> 01:30:16.102
Yeah. Definitely.
I know a place down here.

1311
01:30:17.670 --> 01:30:19.972
Hey, Mrs. C.

1312
01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.739
How you doing, Eddie?

1313
01:30:22.741 --> 01:30:24.309
Ain't nothing changed
but the weather. You know.

1314
01:30:24.311 --> 01:30:27.278
No.

1315
01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.648
So, what culinary delights will
tickle the pickle tonight?

1316
01:30:30.650 --> 01:30:32.316
<i>Tater tots
and chocolate.</i>

1317
01:30:32.318 --> 01:30:33.984
Right. Okay, no problem.

1318
01:30:35.254 --> 01:30:36.821
The payment's due, Chen.

1319
01:30:38.324 --> 01:30:40.324
Please.
I can't keep doing this.

1320
01:30:40.326 --> 01:30:41.892
Now.

1321
01:30:41.894 --> 01:30:43.462
- <i>Bad guy, right?</i>
- Yep.

1322
01:30:51.003 --> 01:30:53.069
You come in here again...

1323
01:30:53.071 --> 01:30:57.740
In fact, you go anywhere in this
city, preying on innocent people,

1324
01:30:57.742 --> 01:31:01.244
and we will find you
and eat both your arms

1325
01:31:01.246 --> 01:31:03.247
- and then both of your legs.
- No, no.

1326
01:31:03.249 --> 01:31:06.317
And then we will eat your face right
off your head. Do you understand?

1327
01:31:06.319 --> 01:31:08.219
- Please...
- Yes.

1328
01:31:08.221 --> 01:31:12.122
So, you will be this armless,
legless, faceless thing, won't you,

1329
01:31:12.124 --> 01:31:16.893
rolling down the street,
like a turd in the wind?

1330
01:31:16.895 --> 01:31:19.265
- Do you feel me?
- What the hell are you?

1331
01:31:21.167 --> 01:31:23.735
We are Venom.

1332
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:27.340
- On second thought...
- Please.

1333
01:31:34.412 --> 01:31:36.813
Eddie? What was that?

1334
01:31:36.815 --> 01:31:38.214
Oh...

1335
01:31:38.216 --> 01:31:42.020
I have a parasite. Yeah.
Night, Mrs. Chen.

1336
01:31:43.356 --> 01:31:44.887
- <i>"Parasite"?</i>
- Yeah.

1337
01:31:44.889 --> 01:31:46.889
It's a term of endearment,
that's all.

1338
01:31:46.891 --> 01:31:48.891
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- No.

1339
01:31:48.893 --> 01:31:51.828
- <i>Apologize!</i>
- All right, fine.

1340
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:54.764
I'm sorry. So, what do you
want to do now?

1341
01:31:54.766 --> 01:31:58.900
<i>The way I see it,
we can do whatever we want.</i>

1342
01:34:26.183 --> 01:34:28.115
I need you
to stay quiet.

1343
01:34:28.117 --> 01:34:31.086
This is a "me" thing.
It is not a "we" thing.

1344
01:34:31.088 --> 01:34:34.224
- You got that?
- <i>Fine, but make it quick.</i>

1345
01:34:38.562 --> 01:34:40.128
Open on five.

1346
01:34:40.130 --> 01:34:43.265
Go. Opening up.

1347
01:34:45.334 --> 01:34:48.036
You ask me, they're dumb
to let him call the shots.

1348
01:34:48.038 --> 01:34:50.572
Second he asked
for you to interview him,

1349
01:34:50.574 --> 01:34:52.306
I'd have shut that
shit down.

1350
01:34:52.308 --> 01:34:54.475
Oh, yeah, you know the FBI.
They're just taking advantage

1351
01:34:54.477 --> 01:34:57.112
of the one and only time
he'll ever speak to anyone.

1352
01:34:57.114 --> 01:35:00.247
They're hoping that I might help them
identify some additional bodies.

1353
01:35:00.249 --> 01:35:03.919
FBI don't work up close
and personal with him.

1354
01:35:03.921 --> 01:35:07.390
The FBI will have to identify you,
if you don't follow the rules.

1355
01:35:10.460 --> 01:35:13.363
Hey, Red!
I got a visitor for you.

1356
01:35:33.516 --> 01:35:36.150
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

1357
01:35:36.152 --> 01:35:40.588
Do you mind if we forego the whole
creepy serial killer thing here?

1358
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:41.988
Sure, it's good with me.

1359
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:44.325
I mean, I can turn it on
if you want.

1360
01:35:44.327 --> 01:35:51.198
I can talk about the Dadaist
patterns of arterial spray.

1361
01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:53.267
I bet you can.

1362
01:35:53.269 --> 01:35:55.738
Tough to see you
in this light, Eddie.

1363
01:35:56.572 --> 01:35:57.607
Come on over.

1364
01:35:58.574 --> 01:36:00.042
All right.

1365
01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.379
I'm here.

1366
01:36:06.381 --> 01:36:10.117
When I get out of here,
and I will,

1367
01:36:11.454 --> 01:36:13.422
there's gonna be carnage.
