2
00:02:02.021 --> 00:02:04.757
John Wick, Excommunicado.

3
00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:07.993
In effect, 6:00 p.m.,
Eastern Standard Time.

4
00:02:59.712 --> 00:03:01.013
I do hope
that Mr. Wick

5
00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:02.882
finds his way to safety.

6
00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:05.017
He knew the rules,
he broke them.

7
00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.286
And killed a man
on company grounds, Charon.

8
00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:09.588
Do you expect him
to make it out?

9
00:03:09.688 --> 00:03:11.257
$14 million bounty
on his head.

10
00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:15.027
And every interested party in
this city wants a piece of it.

11
00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:17.963
I'd say the odds
are about even.

12
00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:38.217
You think the hospital's
there to help, man?

13
00:03:38.317 --> 00:03:39.418
No way!

14
00:03:39.518 --> 00:03:42.521
They'll kill you just as soon
as they'll make you better!

15
00:03:42.621 --> 00:03:44.523
But I know better, man.

16
00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.492
I know better.
I know what I'm...

17
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.768
Tick tock, Mr. Wick.

18
00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.503
Tick tock.

19
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.538
Tick tock.

20
00:03:59.638 --> 00:04:02.842
Tick tock. Tick...

21
00:04:02.942 --> 00:04:05.311
No time to dilly-dally,
Mr. Wick!

22
00:04:19.892 --> 00:04:21.727
The New York Public Library.

23
00:04:21.827 --> 00:04:23.062
You got it.

24
00:04:42.648 --> 00:04:43.883
Change of plan.

25
00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:47.987
To the Continental.

26
00:04:48.087 --> 00:04:51.090
Can you see that he's received
by the concierge?

27
00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.659
Yes, sir, Mr. Wick.

28
00:04:54.927 --> 00:04:58.430
Good dog. Good dog.

29
00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:10.142
John Wick, Excommunicado.

30
00:05:10.242 --> 00:05:12.478
In effect, 20 minutes.

31
00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:34.066
Can I help you?

32
00:05:34.166 --> 00:05:37.336
Russian Folktale.
Alexander Afanasyev.

33
00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:41.607
1864.

34
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.352
Level two.
Thank you.

35
00:06:48.474 --> 00:06:50.476
"Consider your origins."

36
00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:53.412
"You were not made
to live as brutes,"

37
00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:56.115
"but to follow virtue
and knowledge."

38
00:06:58.984 --> 00:07:00.552
Dante.

39
00:07:02.488 --> 00:07:05.024
Looking a little
run down there, John.

40
00:07:05.124 --> 00:07:07.659
Ernest. I still have time.

41
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.163
It's almost up. Who's gonna
know the difference?

42
00:07:11.263 --> 00:07:13.298
You sure this is what
you wanna do?

43
00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:15.167
Fourteen million.
It's a lot of money.

44
00:07:15.267 --> 00:07:16.568
Not if you can't spend it.

45
00:07:53.138 --> 00:07:54.740
Oh, shit.

46
00:08:47.025 --> 00:08:48.160
Push it back.

47
00:09:03.442 --> 00:09:05.077
John Wick, Excommunicado.

48
00:09:05.177 --> 00:09:07.546
In effect, 10 minutes.

49
00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:21.860
Let it be known the Bowery
will honor the Excommunicado.

50
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.664
No help,
no services of any kind.

51
00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:40.412
Doc! Doc, it's Wick!

52
00:09:41.914 --> 00:09:42.848
Mr. Wick.

53
00:09:42.948 --> 00:09:45.384
No, no. You shouldn't be here.
Hour's almost up.

54
00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:47.186
I know, Doc, please.
There's still time.

55
00:09:47.286 --> 00:09:48.787
No! I can't.

56
00:09:48.887 --> 00:09:50.589
I still have five minutes!

57
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:53.258
Please.

58
00:09:59.932 --> 00:10:00.966
Come on. Come on.

59
00:10:07.439 --> 00:10:08.840
All right, sit there.

60
00:10:14.246 --> 00:10:15.814
All right, let me see.
Let me see.

61
00:10:16.615 --> 00:10:17.816
Uh-huh.

62
00:10:19.117 --> 00:10:21.386
Puncture wound.

63
00:10:21.486 --> 00:10:24.756
Went deep.
Nicked the artery.

64
00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.327
Here you go.

65
00:10:29.461 --> 00:10:30.662
All right.

66
00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:36.168
John Wick, Excommunicado.

67
00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:38.470
In effect, one minute.

68
00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:52.651
Doc?

69
00:10:57.155 --> 00:10:58.156
Doc?

70
00:10:58.257 --> 00:11:00.259
Yeah. We're halfway there.

71
00:11:03.061 --> 00:11:04.329
Five seconds.
Yeah.

72
00:11:04.429 --> 00:11:06.832
John Wick, Excommunicado.

73
00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:11.470
In effect, in five, four...

74
00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:14.339
Three, two...

75
00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.375
One.

76
00:11:25.083 --> 00:11:27.119
Sorry, Mr. Wick.

77
00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:28.820
I know. Rules.

78
00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.789
Ah, rules.

79
00:11:36.828 --> 00:11:38.497
John Wick, 14 million.

80
00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:40.932
Open contract
is now in effect.

81
00:11:41.033 --> 00:11:43.568
All services are suspended.

82
00:12:13.932 --> 00:12:16.001
And away we go.

83
00:12:40.692 --> 00:12:43.095
Top shelf. On the right.

84
00:12:43.195 --> 00:12:45.330
Yeah. Take four.

85
00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:48.500
It will give you energy.
Help with the pain.

86
00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:59.511
Mr. Wick?

87
00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:03.482
They'll never believe
I stopped on the hour.

88
00:13:03.815 --> 00:13:04.916
But you did.

89
00:13:05.016 --> 00:13:06.318
They'll know.

90
00:13:06.418 --> 00:13:07.586
Know what?

91
00:13:07.686 --> 00:13:10.055
I told you
where the medicine was.

92
00:13:26.538 --> 00:13:28.573
Where?
Here.

93
00:13:28.673 --> 00:13:29.741
Just below my floating rib.

94
00:13:29.841 --> 00:13:31.410
Be sure not to hit
my large intestine.

95
00:13:33.879 --> 00:13:35.580
Oh, wait!

96
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.749
One may not be enough.

97
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.688
Yeah. All right.

98
00:13:45.023 --> 00:13:46.258
Be sure not to graze my...

99
00:13:46.358 --> 00:13:48.760
Oh!

100
00:13:55.534 --> 00:13:57.636
Good luck, Mr. Wick.

101
00:14:00.238 --> 00:14:01.973
Thanks, Doc.

102
00:23:39.484 --> 00:23:41.986
John Wick. Open contract.

103
00:23:42.086 --> 00:23:44.689
Increase, 15 million.

104
00:23:46.491 --> 00:23:49.560
Where are you going,
Jonathan?

105
00:23:58.703 --> 00:24:00.238
We are closed.

106
00:25:56.954 --> 00:26:01.759
Jardani.
Why have you come home?

107
00:26:07.165 --> 00:26:09.667
You present this to me
like an answer.

108
00:26:09.767 --> 00:26:12.170
I still have my ticket.

109
00:26:13.437 --> 00:26:16.374
After all the chaos you've
caused for the last few weeks,

110
00:26:16.474 --> 00:26:18.843
you think
your ticket is valid?

111
00:26:18.943 --> 00:26:20.978
You forget
that the Ruska Roma

112
00:26:21.078 --> 00:26:22.947
is bound by the High Table,

113
00:26:23.047 --> 00:26:26.250
and the High Table
stands above all?

114
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.719
They could kill me
just for talking to you.

115
00:26:30.188 --> 00:26:35.393
You honor me by bringing death
to my front door.

116
00:26:36.827 --> 00:26:41.432
Oh, Jardani,
what has become of you?

117
00:26:59.383 --> 00:27:01.552
You are bound...

118
00:27:01.652 --> 00:27:04.222
And I am owed.

119
00:27:08.459 --> 00:27:10.361
Rooney, enough!

120
00:27:41.492 --> 00:27:44.428
"You are owed."
You are owed nothing, Jardani.

121
00:27:44.528 --> 00:27:46.797
You know, when my pupils
first come here,

122
00:27:46.897 --> 00:27:48.332
they wish for one thing.

123
00:27:48.432 --> 00:27:50.768
A life free of suffering.

124
00:27:50.868 --> 00:27:53.771
I try to dissuade them
from these childish notions,

125
00:27:53.871 --> 00:27:55.940
but as you know,

126
00:27:56.941 --> 00:27:58.409
art is pain.

127
00:28:01.779 --> 00:28:03.814
Life is suffering.

128
00:28:08.586 --> 00:28:11.055
Somehow,
you managed to get out.

129
00:28:11.922 --> 00:28:14.492
But here you are,
back where you began.

130
00:28:15.359 --> 00:28:17.361
All of this, for what?

131
00:28:54.298 --> 00:28:55.466
Pirouette.

132
00:28:57.268 --> 00:28:59.637
Pirouette, pirouette.

133
00:29:02.506 --> 00:29:03.808
Sit.

134
00:29:17.154 --> 00:29:22.360
Even if I wanted to,
I can't help you, Jardani.

135
00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:25.596
The High Table
wants your life.

136
00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:28.833
How can you fight the wind?

137
00:29:28.933 --> 00:29:30.601
How can you smash
the mountains?

138
00:29:30.701 --> 00:29:33.204
How can you bury the ocean?

139
00:29:33.304 --> 00:29:35.740
How can you escape
from the light?

140
00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.509
Of course,
you can go to the dark.

141
00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:40.845
But they're in the dark, too.

142
00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:48.486
So tell me, Jardani.
What do you really want?

143
00:29:50.988 --> 00:29:52.390
Passage.

144
00:29:53.557 --> 00:29:55.059
Where did you want to go?

145
00:29:56.927 --> 00:29:58.863
Casablanca.

146
00:30:00.564 --> 00:30:03.801
The path to paradise
begins in hell.

147
00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.441
So be it.

148
00:30:10.541 --> 00:30:14.545
You hand me your ticket,
I will tear it.

149
00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:17.815
If that's what
you really desire.

150
00:30:56.987 --> 00:31:00.791
With this, Jardani,
your ticket is torn.

151
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:12.536
You can never come home again.

152
00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:16.073
Take him to the lifeboat.

153
00:31:17.575 --> 00:31:18.976
Do svidanya.

154
00:31:21.679 --> 00:31:23.747
Do svidanya.

155
00:31:54.211 --> 00:31:57.748
Welcome to the Continental.
How may I help you?

156
00:32:15.866 --> 00:32:20.804
Sir. There is an Adjudicator
here to see you.

157
00:32:22.406 --> 00:32:23.774
Very well, sir.

158
00:32:26.644 --> 00:32:28.946
The manager is in the lounge.

159
00:32:33.417 --> 00:32:37.454
I presume you're
here to discuss John Wick.

160
00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.890
If that's so,
we can make this short.

161
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:43.561
I told him to walk away,
he declined to do so.

162
00:32:43.661 --> 00:32:45.229
And that's the all of it.

163
00:32:46.230 --> 00:32:47.431
Mr. Wick broke the rules.

164
00:32:47.531 --> 00:32:49.700
Oh, yes.

165
00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:52.036
And I haven't got the
slightest idea where he is...

166
00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:53.203
You're mistaken.

167
00:32:53.304 --> 00:32:54.939
I'm not here for Mr. Wick.

168
00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:57.575
I'm here because Mr. Wick
broke the rules in this hotel.

169
00:32:57.675 --> 00:32:58.943
Hmm.
The blood was spilt

170
00:32:59.043 --> 00:33:01.412
on the grounds of
the Continental. Was it not?

171
00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:02.479
Oh, yes.

172
00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:04.782
As a matter of fact,
the body gets colder

173
00:33:04.882 --> 00:33:06.750
within these very walls.

174
00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:09.253
I'd like to see it.

175
00:33:37.114 --> 00:33:39.817
Santino D'Antonio.

176
00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:42.152
A newly instated member
of the High Table,

177
00:33:42.252 --> 00:33:43.120
slain by Mr. Wick

178
00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:46.256
while seeking sanctuary
in the Continental.

179
00:33:50.361 --> 00:33:53.797
With a .45 ACP,
it appears.

180
00:33:53.897 --> 00:33:56.800
I had no control
over Mr. Wick's actions.

181
00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:59.970
And yet, he lives
because you deemed it so, yes?

182
00:34:00.571 --> 00:34:01.639
Yes.

183
00:34:01.739 --> 00:34:03.807
You have known Mr. Wick
for a great many years.

184
00:34:03.907 --> 00:34:06.343
It might even be fair
to call you friends, yes?

185
00:34:07.378 --> 00:34:09.580
Instead of stopping him,
instead of killing him,

186
00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:11.281
you stood by
and let him walk away

187
00:34:11.382 --> 00:34:13.851
after he shot Santino
D'Antonio in front of you.

188
00:34:13.951 --> 00:34:15.919
I made him Excommunicado.

189
00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:18.856
But not before you gave
him an hour to escape.

190
00:34:18.956 --> 00:34:20.624
He broke the rules
in my hotel.

191
00:34:20.724 --> 00:34:23.227
This is exactly the
problem, your hotel.

192
00:34:23.327 --> 00:34:25.596
Where is your fealty?

193
00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:27.765
I've been of service
for over 40 years.

194
00:34:27.865 --> 00:34:29.967
Under the Table.
Serving the Table.

195
00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:31.735
Everything is under the Table.

196
00:34:31.835 --> 00:34:33.504
I understand
that you have your loyalties,

197
00:34:33.604 --> 00:34:34.872
but this cannot be overlooked.

198
00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:38.308
Let me be clear.
I am here to adjudge you.

199
00:34:38.409 --> 00:34:40.344
You have one week
to get your affairs in order.

200
00:34:41.812 --> 00:34:42.880
Excuse me?

201
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.016
At such time,
your successor will be named.

202
00:34:47.618 --> 00:34:49.053
There are rules,

203
00:34:49.153 --> 00:34:50.788
they are the only things
that separate us...

204
00:34:50.888 --> 00:34:53.357
From the animals.
Yes.

205
00:34:53.457 --> 00:34:55.325
You have seven days.

206
00:34:58.662 --> 00:35:02.066
In the meantime, if you need any
assistance with your transition,

207
00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:04.935
you may look for me
in room 217.

208
00:35:05.035 --> 00:35:08.238
Enjoy your stay
at the Continental.

209
00:35:21.118 --> 00:35:23.921
There's an Adjudicator
here to see you.

210
00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:40.871
Welcome to my Mission Control.

211
00:35:40.971 --> 00:35:44.241
Brain stem of my operation.
The information super flyway.

212
00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:46.710
From whence I control
the word on the street,

213
00:35:46.810 --> 00:35:48.078
the way of the world.

214
00:35:48.178 --> 00:35:49.213
With pigeons.

215
00:35:49.313 --> 00:35:53.484
Yes. You see rats with wings,
but I see the Internet.

216
00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:58.355
No IP addresses.
No digital footprint.

217
00:35:58.455 --> 00:36:02.392
Can't track it, can't hack it,
can't trace it.

218
00:36:02.493 --> 00:36:04.962
Can you get disease from it?

219
00:36:05.062 --> 00:36:07.765
Well, I wouldn't recommend
that you eat one.

220
00:36:08.532 --> 00:36:10.601
What the hell do you want?

221
00:36:10.701 --> 00:36:12.569
I wanted to see
where it didn't happen.

222
00:36:12.669 --> 00:36:14.138
Where what didn't happen?

223
00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:16.273
Where you didn't kill
John Wick.

224
00:36:17.141 --> 00:36:18.175
I've always been
under the impression

225
00:36:18.275 --> 00:36:21.512
that contracts and executing
them was optional.

226
00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:23.847
I have no problem
with John Wick.

227
00:36:29.853 --> 00:36:33.157
And yet, you gave John
a seven-round Kimber 1911,

228
00:36:33.257 --> 00:36:34.892
knowing that
he intended to use it

229
00:36:34.992 --> 00:36:37.060
to stand against the Table.
Yes?

230
00:36:41.231 --> 00:36:44.268
This Kimber 1911,
to be exact.

231
00:36:51.608 --> 00:36:53.143
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

232
00:36:53.243 --> 00:36:55.913
the High Table
is giving you seven days.

233
00:36:56.013 --> 00:36:58.482
Seven days for what, exactly?

234
00:36:58.582 --> 00:36:59.716
To settle your affairs

235
00:36:59.817 --> 00:37:02.052
and find a new home
for your birds.

236
00:37:02.152 --> 00:37:04.955
In seven days,
you abdicate your throne.

237
00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.202
Oh, my dear.

238
00:37:18.302 --> 00:37:20.938
Tell me, do you know what
the Bowery is, Adjudicator?

239
00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:23.440
Do you know what happens
when I wave my hand?

240
00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:27.044
No, there will be no replacement
for me on the throne.

241
00:37:27.144 --> 00:37:29.680
Because I am the throne, baby.

242
00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.115
I am the Bowery!

243
00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:35.219
I am all that you deign
not to look at

244
00:37:35.319 --> 00:37:36.820
when you walk
down the street at night.

245
00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.058
The Bowery is mine.
Mine alone.

246
00:37:41.859 --> 00:37:43.360
Do not make the mistake
of thinking

247
00:37:43.460 --> 00:37:46.930
you exist outside
the rules, no men do.

248
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:49.099
You have seven days.

249
00:39:28.865 --> 00:39:30.467
Enough!

250
00:39:35.672 --> 00:39:38.775
I'm afraid our friend here
is off limits.

251
00:39:38.875 --> 00:39:41.478
But he's Excommunicado.

252
00:39:41.578 --> 00:39:44.581
It seems the manager
has granted him amnesty.

253
00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:47.184
Mr. Jonathan,

254
00:39:47.284 --> 00:39:50.354
would you be so kind
as to come with me?

255
00:40:10.173 --> 00:40:13.243
Welcome to Casablanca,
Mr. Wick.

256
00:40:13.343 --> 00:40:15.512
Thanks.

257
00:40:20.183 --> 00:40:21.385
Mr. Jonathan,

258
00:40:21.485 --> 00:40:23.253
it has been a long time
since our fine city

259
00:40:23.353 --> 00:40:25.389
has been graced
with your presence.

260
00:40:25.822 --> 00:40:26.990
I need to talk to...

261
00:40:27.090 --> 00:40:29.126
Yes, Ms. Al-Azwar,
she's expecting you.

262
00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:40.003
My, my, welcome
to the Moroccan Continental.

263
00:40:40.103 --> 00:40:42.172
I hope you'll find it
to your taste.

264
00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:45.075
Right this way.

265
00:40:45.175 --> 00:40:48.278
Ms. Al-Azwar,
she waits for no man.

266
00:40:51.782 --> 00:40:57.054
Best of luck, Mr. Jonathan.
Best of luck.

267
00:41:31.521 --> 00:41:33.223
You a dog person, John?

268
00:41:33.323 --> 00:41:35.492
Sofia?

269
00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:42.499
Sofia!

270
00:41:42.599 --> 00:41:45.168
You can't kill the bearer
of your marker.

271
00:41:45.268 --> 00:41:48.505
I didn't kill you.
I just shot you.

272
00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:50.707
Nice suit.

273
00:41:53.143 --> 00:41:54.578
Good to see you, too.

274
00:41:54.678 --> 00:41:57.347
I should shoot you
in the head right now.

275
00:41:57.447 --> 00:41:58.782
I know.

276
00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:06.189
Don't you do it.

277
00:42:07.257 --> 00:42:09.593
You're Excommunicado, John.

278
00:42:09.693 --> 00:42:14.598
And that marker
doesn't mean shit.

279
00:42:19.669 --> 00:42:21.671
This is your blood.

280
00:42:22.739 --> 00:42:24.541
Your bond.

281
00:42:24.641 --> 00:42:29.679
When you needed help,
I was there.

282
00:42:37.654 --> 00:42:38.688
Sit.

283
00:42:42.459 --> 00:42:45.228
I was talking to you, John.

284
00:42:49.332 --> 00:42:53.970
You do realize that
I'm management now, right?

285
00:42:54.070 --> 00:42:55.739
I'm not service anymore, John.

286
00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:59.509
So I don't go around
shooting people in the head.

287
00:42:59.609 --> 00:43:02.112
I'm not asking you
to kill anyone.

288
00:43:02.212 --> 00:43:04.481
I just need you
to get me to him.

289
00:43:04.581 --> 00:43:07.450
To who?
Your old boss.

290
00:43:09.352 --> 00:43:10.620
You want to kill Berrada.

291
00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:12.689
I'm not gonna kill him.
I just need to talk.

292
00:43:12.789 --> 00:43:15.592
What could he
possibly give to you?

293
00:43:18.028 --> 00:43:19.429
Guidance.

294
00:43:19.529 --> 00:43:24.267
Look, I made a deal when
I agreed to run this hotel.

295
00:43:24.367 --> 00:43:25.502
And that deal said

296
00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:28.371
that I had to follow
the rules of the Table.

297
00:43:28.471 --> 00:43:31.608
If you're not gonna kill him,
he is gonna kill you,

298
00:43:31.708 --> 00:43:35.345
and then probably me, too,
for walking you up in there.

299
00:43:35.445 --> 00:43:39.416
If I make one mistake,
one enemy...

300
00:43:40.517 --> 00:43:44.287
Maybe somebody goes
looking for my daughter.

301
00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:48.725
And I know what you did,
John, to get her out.

302
00:43:49.726 --> 00:43:54.331
But that's not a chance
I can take. Sorry.

303
00:43:56.166 --> 00:43:58.635
Do you wanna know
where she is?

304
00:43:59.302 --> 00:44:02.339
No. I don't ever wanna know.

305
00:44:02.439 --> 00:44:05.508
Because I don't trust
that I won't go find her.

306
00:44:06.576 --> 00:44:10.547
A part of me longs for her.

307
00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:14.784
And I have to kill that part
of myself every day,

308
00:44:14.884 --> 00:44:16.586
just to keep her safe.

309
00:44:19.589 --> 00:44:26.129
Because sometimes you have
to kill what you love.

310
00:44:26.696 --> 00:44:29.366
That's why I gave you that
marker in the first place.

311
00:44:29.466 --> 00:44:31.334
That's why
I'm sitting here right now

312
00:44:31.434 --> 00:44:33.803
and that's why I'm fucked!

313
00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:41.511
Consequences.
Yeah.

314
00:44:43.246 --> 00:44:45.348
Consequences.

315
00:44:47.217 --> 00:44:49.519
I'm just asking you to try.

316
00:44:50.353 --> 00:44:52.055
Either way, you and me,

317
00:44:52.789 --> 00:44:54.391
we'll be even.

318
00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:06.703
No.

319
00:45:07.637 --> 00:45:13.576
After this,
we are less than even.

320
00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:19.449
We leave in 10 minutes.

321
00:46:15.939 --> 00:46:17.640
How can I help you?

322
00:46:29.786 --> 00:46:32.489
I wasn't expecting
the High Table so soon.

323
00:46:34.657 --> 00:46:36.593
There is a task.

324
00:46:36.693 --> 00:46:38.928
It involves someone
who broke the rules

325
00:46:39.028 --> 00:46:40.397
and stood against the Table.

326
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:44.267
John Wick, you mean.

327
00:46:44.367 --> 00:46:46.236
My students
have not been idle.

328
00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:49.506
John Wick and all
who've helped him.

329
00:46:49.606 --> 00:46:51.608
You've heard the stories
about him, of course.

330
00:46:51.708 --> 00:46:54.344
Killed scores of men this
past week alone because of...

331
00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:56.946
A dog, a car.

332
00:46:57.881 --> 00:46:59.015
I'm familiar.

333
00:47:02.318 --> 00:47:04.020
And I'm interested.

334
00:47:05.255 --> 00:47:06.623
Very.

335
00:47:13.062 --> 00:47:16.032
Blowfish. Very fatal.

336
00:47:20.904 --> 00:47:22.038
No soy.

337
00:47:30.513 --> 00:47:34.217
I have served,
I will be of service.

338
00:49:15.351 --> 00:49:17.020
Stop!

339
00:49:23.493 --> 00:49:24.827
Out!

340
00:49:31.134 --> 00:49:34.537
The High Table and the Ruska
Roma have an understanding.

341
00:49:34.637 --> 00:49:37.607
Yes, and you helped John Wick.

342
00:49:37.707 --> 00:49:38.675
He had a ticket.

343
00:49:38.775 --> 00:49:41.411
But a ticket does not stand
above the Table.

344
00:49:41.511 --> 00:49:44.581
Your penance
will be paid in blood.

345
00:49:45.081 --> 00:49:46.115
Now...

346
00:49:48.785 --> 00:49:53.590
Hold out your helping hands
and pledge your fealty.

347
00:50:01.531 --> 00:50:07.070
I have served,
I will be of service.

348
00:50:29.692 --> 00:50:31.894
We're not going in
like the old days.

349
00:50:32.662 --> 00:50:34.964
It's just a conversation.

350
00:50:35.064 --> 00:50:39.168
Nothing's ever just
a conversation with you, John.

351
00:50:42.972 --> 00:50:44.374
Let's go.

352
00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:10.266
Sofia.

353
00:51:10.366 --> 00:51:12.869
Always so nice to see you.

354
00:51:12.969 --> 00:51:16.939
And the dogs, of course, how marvelous.
May I pet one?

355
00:51:17.740 --> 00:51:18.741
Certainly.

356
00:51:22.945 --> 00:51:25.048
Fantastic.

357
00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:28.117
Jonathan Wick.

358
00:51:28.217 --> 00:51:31.688
I had heard you had
made your way to our shores.

359
00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.895
Come along now.

360
00:51:38.995 --> 00:51:41.164
I am certain
we have much to discuss.

361
00:51:45.435 --> 00:51:50.173
I must admit, I am curious.
What brings you to my domain?

362
00:51:51.607 --> 00:51:52.742
Tell me.

363
00:51:52.842 --> 00:51:54.977
Do you come here to kill me?

364
00:51:57.213 --> 00:51:58.347
No.

365
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:11.961
Mr. Wick, do you know where the
word "assassin" comes from?

366
00:52:13.463 --> 00:52:16.999
People argue. "Assassin."

367
00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:22.138
Hashasheen,
followers of Hassan-i...

368
00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:26.209
Eaters of hashish.

369
00:52:27.543 --> 00:52:29.078
No, thank you.

370
00:52:30.213 --> 00:52:33.683
But others contend
it comes from asasiyyun.

371
00:52:33.783 --> 00:52:36.119
Meaning, "men who are faithful"

372
00:52:36.219 --> 00:52:38.254
"and who abide
by their beliefs."

373
00:52:39.989 --> 00:52:42.191
You see that coin?

374
00:52:42.291 --> 00:52:45.862
The first coin ever minted
in this facility.

375
00:52:45.962 --> 00:52:49.232
Next to it, the first marker.

376
00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.934
Not easy to track down,
believe me.

377
00:52:52.034 --> 00:52:53.269
Now, this coin, of course,

378
00:52:53.369 --> 00:52:56.606
it does not represent
monetary value.

379
00:52:56.706 --> 00:52:59.742
It represents
the commerce of relationships,

380
00:52:59.842 --> 00:53:03.312
a social contract in which
you agree to partake.

381
00:53:04.447 --> 00:53:06.182
Order and rules.

382
00:53:06.983 --> 00:53:08.885
You have broken the rules.

383
00:53:08.985 --> 00:53:11.988
The High Table
has marked you for death.

384
00:53:12.088 --> 00:53:14.023
Why would I allow you
to leave here alive,

385
00:53:14.123 --> 00:53:18.327
when your life has been
by your own actions, forfeit?

386
00:53:23.432 --> 00:53:25.334
I seek to make amends.

387
00:53:26.002 --> 00:53:28.237
To pay for what I've done.

388
00:53:28.337 --> 00:53:32.275
I seek a meeting with the one
who sits above the Table.

389
00:53:36.646 --> 00:53:40.249
This dog,
I do so love it.

390
00:53:40.349 --> 00:53:43.486
Tell me, does it shed
a great deal?

391
00:53:46.355 --> 00:53:48.191
Occasionally.

392
00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:51.627
When I leave, you can tell
the Elder I'm coming.

393
00:53:51.727 --> 00:53:53.029
And if he wants me dead...

394
00:53:53.129 --> 00:53:56.833
Then he will see to it that your
bones bleach under the sun.

395
00:53:57.600 --> 00:53:59.135
I see.

396
00:53:59.235 --> 00:54:01.571
And I would have provided him
with a choice.

397
00:54:08.878 --> 00:54:10.246
I am sorry, Mr. Wick.

398
00:54:11.747 --> 00:54:14.183
I cannot tell you
where to find the Elder.

399
00:54:16.919 --> 00:54:18.821
You fail to understand.

400
00:54:18.921 --> 00:54:20.857
The Elder
is not a man you find.

401
00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:23.392
He can only choose
to find you.

402
00:54:23.492 --> 00:54:25.228
You wish to speak with him?

403
00:54:25.328 --> 00:54:28.698
Go to the edge of the
desert, look up.

404
00:54:28.798 --> 00:54:30.199
Canis Minor,

405
00:54:30.299 --> 00:54:33.703
the dog that followed Orion
through the sky.

406
00:54:33.803 --> 00:54:35.738
You follow the brightest star.

407
00:54:35.838 --> 00:54:38.374
Walk until
you are almost dead.

408
00:54:38.474 --> 00:54:40.910
Then, keep walking.

409
00:54:41.010 --> 00:54:42.979
When you are
on your last breath,

410
00:54:43.079 --> 00:54:47.283
he will find you...
Or he will not.

411
00:54:48.951 --> 00:54:50.620
I am grateful.

412
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:54.624
Thank you, sir.

413
00:54:57.059 --> 00:55:00.162
Perhaps you were
not listening before.

414
00:55:03.432 --> 00:55:05.368
The social contract.

415
00:55:06.602 --> 00:55:08.271
The commerce of relationships.

416
00:55:09.372 --> 00:55:11.574
You have received
a great gift.

417
00:55:11.674 --> 00:55:13.175
I have hosted your friend.

418
00:55:14.076 --> 00:55:16.145
What do you offer in return?

419
00:55:20.182 --> 00:55:23.052
So soft and yet so fierce.

420
00:55:23.953 --> 00:55:26.155
I love it, this dog.

421
00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:28.724
I will keep it.

422
00:55:28.824 --> 00:55:29.959
Excuse me?

423
00:55:30.059 --> 00:55:31.761
This will be my gift.

424
00:55:31.861 --> 00:55:34.463
This will be how
you show me your fealty.

425
00:55:34.563 --> 00:55:35.731
No.

426
00:55:35.831 --> 00:55:38.000
Surely it's the least
you can do.

427
00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:40.269
No, you cannot keep my dog.

428
00:55:41.304 --> 00:55:42.705
Very well.

429
00:55:43.773 --> 00:55:45.341
Very well.

430
00:55:47.610 --> 00:55:48.911
Then I will kill it.

431
00:55:54.083 --> 00:55:55.952
I'm sorry, Sofia.

432
00:55:56.052 --> 00:55:58.354
This was for you to learn.

433
00:56:06.862 --> 00:56:08.164
Don't.

434
00:56:49.672 --> 00:56:52.008
Sofia. Don't.

435
00:56:56.746 --> 00:56:58.681
He shot my dog.

436
00:56:59.915 --> 00:57:01.484
I get it.

437
00:57:03.652 --> 00:57:06.122
We gotta go. Now.

438
01:03:41.483 --> 01:03:43.051
Here you go.

439
01:03:47.489 --> 01:03:50.225
You're gonna die, John.

440
01:03:50.325 --> 01:03:53.328
Whether out here
in this desert,

441
01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:56.098
or somewhere else
down the road.

442
01:03:57.666 --> 01:03:59.701
But you are gonna die.

443
01:04:14.983 --> 01:04:16.785
Consequences.

444
01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.090
Consequences.

445
01:04:48.984 --> 01:04:50.686
Better get going.

446
01:04:59.895 --> 01:05:01.163
Sofia.

447
01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:44.159
Okay.

448
01:07:49.297 --> 01:07:51.066
You made your point.

449
01:07:52.434 --> 01:07:54.336
You have earned my fealty.

450
01:07:55.437 --> 01:07:56.605
Matter of fact...

451
01:07:56.705 --> 01:07:58.240
I'm gonna shove so much
fealty up your ass

452
01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:00.342
it's gonna come
spilling out of your mouth.

453
01:08:00.442 --> 01:08:02.511
You had your chance.

454
01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:05.580
Well, since you see it
that way,

455
01:08:05.681 --> 01:08:07.516
I guess it's time I told you

456
01:08:07.616 --> 01:08:11.753
to climb down off your High
Table and go fuck yourself.

457
01:08:11.853 --> 01:08:13.755
Duly noted.

458
01:08:13.855 --> 01:08:15.490
You gave John Wick
seven bullets,

459
01:08:15.590 --> 01:08:19.161
your penance will be paid
with seven cuts.

460
01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:22.230
Well, sometimes you gotta
cut a motherfucker.

461
01:08:25.867 --> 01:08:28.336
Avert your eyes,
my sweet.

462
01:08:29.171 --> 01:08:32.107
The king is dead.

463
01:08:36.878 --> 01:08:38.980
Long live the king.

464
01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:34.136
Drink.

465
01:09:35.403 --> 01:09:39.908
Don't worry, your weapon
is still there. Please drink.

466
01:09:50.018 --> 01:09:54.156
My son, how have you
come to be so lost?

467
01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:55.791
Not lost.

468
01:09:56.658 --> 01:09:57.993
Looking for you.

469
01:09:58.093 --> 01:10:00.896
You think
I speak of your location?

470
01:10:02.097 --> 01:10:03.999
Never seen a man fight so hard

471
01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:06.334
to end up
back where he started.

472
01:10:13.975 --> 01:10:15.911
So tell me, Jonathan.

473
01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:18.180
Why do you wish to live?

474
01:10:18.680 --> 01:10:22.184
My wife, Helen.

475
01:10:24.286 --> 01:10:29.257
To remember her.
To remember us.

476
01:10:29.357 --> 01:10:32.360
So you seek to live
for the memory of love?

477
01:10:33.862 --> 01:10:36.231
At least a chance to earn it.

478
01:10:37.532 --> 01:10:41.903
I can give you one last chance
to earn a life.

479
01:10:42.003 --> 01:10:44.239
However, it might not be
the life that you wish.

480
01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.409
Complete a task for us,

481
01:10:47.509 --> 01:10:49.744
and your Excommunicado
will be reversed.

482
01:10:49.845 --> 01:10:51.913
The open contract closed,

483
01:10:52.013 --> 01:10:53.982
you would be permitted
to continue to live.

484
01:10:54.082 --> 01:10:57.085
Not free under the Table,
but bound to it.

485
01:10:57.185 --> 01:11:00.455
Doing what you do best
for the rest of your days.

486
01:11:04.659 --> 01:11:06.328
The choice is yours.

487
01:11:08.363 --> 01:11:10.365
Die here and now.

488
01:11:10.465 --> 01:11:13.635
Or continue to live
and remember through death.

489
01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:32.888
What must be done?

490
01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:35.924
The cost of your life
will be the death of others.

491
01:11:36.024 --> 01:11:39.027
The first of which will be
the man they call Winston.

492
01:11:39.928 --> 01:11:40.962
What?

493
01:11:41.062 --> 01:11:43.531
He has forgotten his fealty.

494
01:11:43.632 --> 01:11:46.201
Neither the open contract
nor the Excommunicado

495
01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:49.170
will be lifted
until you complete your task.

496
01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:51.506
So if you wish to live,

497
01:11:51.606 --> 01:11:54.276
and if you wish to remember,

498
01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.411
this is the choice
you must make.

499
01:12:13.094 --> 01:12:15.330
I will serve.

500
01:12:17.165 --> 01:12:20.335
I will be of service.

501
01:12:20.435 --> 01:12:22.504
Very well, my son.

502
01:12:22.604 --> 01:12:24.306
Cast aside your weakness

503
01:12:24.406 --> 01:12:27.475
and reaffirm your fealty
to the table.

504
01:12:33.615 --> 01:12:35.083
Mr. John Wick.

505
01:13:22.564 --> 01:13:24.265
Thank you.

506
01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:29.404
I accept this offering
and your fealty.

507
01:13:46.454 --> 01:13:49.324
I wish you good luck
on your path.

508
01:13:49.424 --> 01:13:52.427
Zahir will help you prepare
for your departure.

509
01:13:53.962 --> 01:13:55.363
And Mr. Wick.

510
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:38.006
JFK Express
now arriving on platform nine.

511
01:14:38.106 --> 01:14:41.309
JFK Express now arriving
on platform nine.

512
01:16:03.992 --> 01:16:05.393
Stick together, kids.

513
01:16:05.493 --> 01:16:06.661
Make sure
you're holding the hand

514
01:16:06.761 --> 01:16:10.231
of the person
in front and behind you.

515
01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:15.703
You see? That's why
you're special, John Wick.

516
01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.708
I wouldn't have stopped.

517
01:16:22.043 --> 01:16:23.711
It's good to have you back.

518
01:16:30.652 --> 01:16:32.520
How was your trip?

519
01:16:35.023 --> 01:16:37.258
Going to the Continental?

520
01:16:43.131 --> 01:16:44.899
He with you?

521
01:16:44.999 --> 01:16:47.402
He was.

522
01:16:57.378 --> 01:16:58.913
Nice trick.

523
01:20:06.567 --> 01:20:09.470
Sir! Put your weapon down.

524
01:20:10.738 --> 01:20:13.374
He's Excommunicado.

525
01:20:13.474 --> 01:20:15.943
Unless you wish
to become the same,

526
01:20:16.744 --> 01:20:20.081
I suggest you lower your gun.

527
01:20:26.187 --> 01:20:28.423
I'd like to see the manager.

528
01:20:30.792 --> 01:20:32.627
Of course.

529
01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:35.630
If you would be so kind
as to follow me.

530
01:20:48.509 --> 01:20:49.911
Please take a seat.

531
01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:52.647
I will let him know
you have arrived.

532
01:21:27.181 --> 01:21:28.616
I gotta tell you,

533
01:21:28.716 --> 01:21:31.686
I've been looking forward to
meeting you for a long time.

534
01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:35.089
I'm a huge fan. John Wick.

535
01:21:37.058 --> 01:21:40.495
And so far,
you haven't disappointed.

536
01:21:43.598 --> 01:21:45.900
Is that the dog?

537
01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.935
He likes you.

538
01:21:48.035 --> 01:21:52.640
Me? I'm more of
a cat person myself.

539
01:21:53.107 --> 01:21:54.775
Hey, dog.

540
01:21:57.378 --> 01:22:01.682
We're the same, you know.
Both given the same gift.

541
01:22:01.782 --> 01:22:04.051
We're not the same.

542
01:22:04.151 --> 01:22:05.720
Yes, we are.

543
01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:08.890
No, we're not.

544
01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.459
The manager
is ready for you now.

545
01:22:11.559 --> 01:22:13.528
In the administrative lounge,
sir.

546
01:22:28.042 --> 01:22:29.343
Mr. Wick.

547
01:22:31.546 --> 01:22:32.780
Sit.

548
01:22:34.081 --> 01:22:35.550
Stay.

549
01:22:36.884 --> 01:22:37.952
Good dog.

550
01:23:33.908 --> 01:23:36.377
Tread carefully, Jonathan.

551
01:23:44.685 --> 01:23:48.089
We only use this room
on special occasions.

552
01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:52.326
When you simply have to see
what your opponent is holding

553
01:23:52.426 --> 01:23:54.028
under the table.

554
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:58.165
How was your journey here?
Eventful?

555
01:23:59.266 --> 01:24:00.434
Yeah.

556
01:24:00.534 --> 01:24:02.370
Well, of course.

557
01:24:02.470 --> 01:24:07.174
They sent men to kill you,
and now you to kill me.

558
01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:10.044
Isn't that why you're here?

559
01:24:10.144 --> 01:24:15.049
I have served,
I will be of service.

560
01:24:16.817 --> 01:24:19.553
But you're having doubts.

561
01:24:19.654 --> 01:24:23.591
Just don't make the mistake of
pretending this is personal.

562
01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:25.860
If you feel you must,

563
01:24:27.995 --> 01:24:30.398
put a bullet through my heart.

564
01:24:36.837 --> 01:24:39.440
The High Table has asked me
to step down.

565
01:24:39.540 --> 01:24:41.075
The hour?

566
01:24:41.575 --> 01:24:42.677
The hour.

567
01:24:42.777 --> 01:24:45.279
You should have killed me
in the Continental.

568
01:24:46.447 --> 01:24:48.683
Maybe I should have.

569
01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:51.385
Rules and consequences.

570
01:24:51.485 --> 01:24:52.820
Hmm.

571
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.188
It seems like everyone
is suffering

572
01:24:54.288 --> 01:24:56.791
from the consequences
of their actions.

573
01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:59.360
And you're not stepping down?

574
01:25:01.328 --> 01:25:02.897
No.

575
01:25:03.597 --> 01:25:05.499
I don't think I am.

576
01:25:05.599 --> 01:25:07.501
So it's war?

577
01:25:07.601 --> 01:25:09.970
You're going to war
with the High Table?

578
01:25:10.571 --> 01:25:11.772
Skirmish.

579
01:25:11.872 --> 01:25:12.907
Unless you decide to shoot me.

580
01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:17.044
But, then, I'd rather die
at the hand of a friend

581
01:25:17.545 --> 01:25:19.914
than that of an enemy.

582
01:25:20.014 --> 01:25:22.983
No, I've made my choice.
It's up to you to make yours.

583
01:25:24.585 --> 01:25:26.654
What choice?

584
01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:29.323
You shoot me,
you sell your soul.

585
01:25:29.423 --> 01:25:33.728
But I'll be alive.
And I can remember her.

586
01:25:33.828 --> 01:25:36.330
Until you die as a servant
of the High Table.

587
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:41.102
Now, you did the impossible,
you stopped, you got out.

588
01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:44.371
You only came back because
Helen was taken away from you.

589
01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:48.943
The real question is,
who do you wish to die as?

590
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:50.845
The Baba Yaga?

591
01:25:50.945 --> 01:25:52.913
The last thing
many men ever see?

592
01:25:53.013 --> 01:25:57.918
Or as a man who loved
and was loved by his wife?

593
01:25:58.018 --> 01:26:00.955
Who do you wish
to die as, Jonathan?

594
01:26:32.953 --> 01:26:35.756
Mr. Wick,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

595
01:26:35.856 --> 01:26:37.792
I am an Adjudicator.

596
01:26:38.993 --> 01:26:41.028
Have you decided to step down?

597
01:26:43.531 --> 01:26:46.133
I think not.

598
01:26:46.233 --> 01:26:49.470
And you? Will you be putting
a bullet in his head?

599
01:26:52.807 --> 01:26:56.143
No, I don't think I will.

600
01:27:03.717 --> 01:27:05.186
Very well.

601
01:27:13.394 --> 01:27:14.662
Administration.

602
01:27:14.762 --> 01:27:17.164
I'd like to
change a designation.

603
01:27:17.798 --> 01:27:18.899
Verification?

604
01:27:18.999 --> 01:27:22.136
Adjudication 1-0-1-1-9-7-9.

605
01:27:22.236 --> 01:27:24.171
The Continental Hotel,
New York.

606
01:27:24.271 --> 01:27:26.307
New designation?

607
01:27:26.407 --> 01:27:27.975
Deconsecrated.

608
01:27:30.611 --> 01:27:31.846
Processing.

609
01:27:34.014 --> 01:27:35.349
Administrator.

610
01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:40.988
File. The New York
Continental Hotel.

611
01:27:51.198 --> 01:27:55.936
The New York Continental Hotel
has been deconsecrated. Goodbye.

612
01:28:02.977 --> 01:28:05.312
Gentlemen, this institution
is now deconsecrated.

613
01:28:05.412 --> 01:28:08.182
Business may now be conducted
on Continental grounds.

614
01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:10.251
Since you are refusing
to step down

615
01:28:10.351 --> 01:28:14.922
and you are refusing a direct
order, your lives are now forfeit.

616
01:28:15.022 --> 01:28:17.057
High Table emissaries will be
joining you presently

617
01:28:17.157 --> 01:28:20.094
to see the removal of
your souls from the property.

618
01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:23.297
Good evening, gentlemen.

619
01:28:27.134 --> 01:28:30.571
This haven is safe no more.

620
01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:36.176
Are services
still off limits to me?

621
01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:38.012
Under the circumstances,

622
01:28:38.112 --> 01:28:40.080
your privileges
are reinstated immediately.

623
01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.715
What do you need?

624
01:28:42.216 --> 01:28:45.586
Guns. Lots of guns.

625
01:29:03.837 --> 01:29:06.040
Let's make a withdrawal.

626
01:29:29.863 --> 01:29:31.165
Remember, sir.

627
01:29:31.265 --> 01:29:33.534
These will be
High Table forces.

628
01:29:33.634 --> 01:29:36.437
We may have to consider
our choices carefully.

629
01:29:36.904 --> 01:29:38.038
Why?

630
01:29:38.138 --> 01:29:40.107
Much has changed
during your time away.

631
01:29:40.741 --> 01:29:41.775
Like what?

632
01:29:41.875 --> 01:29:44.979
Well, let us say they have
made armor improvements.

633
01:29:52.586 --> 01:29:56.457
May I suggest
the 2011 Combat Master

634
01:29:56.557 --> 01:29:59.193
in combination with
the nine millimeter major.

635
01:30:10.437 --> 01:30:12.106
Attention, all guests.

636
01:30:12.206 --> 01:30:15.476
The Continental Hotel
is closing for fumigation.

637
01:30:15.576 --> 01:30:17.311
We apologize
for the inconvenience.

638
01:30:17.411 --> 01:30:19.646
Please make your way
to the nearest exit.

639
01:30:24.284 --> 01:30:26.954
Attention, all guests.
The Continental Hotel...

640
01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:30.724
It seems circumstances
have changed in your favor.

641
01:30:30.824 --> 01:30:32.259
Your transaction
may now be conducted

642
01:30:32.359 --> 01:30:34.261
on Continental grounds.

643
01:30:39.666 --> 01:30:43.003
We'll be sending some of our
finest for additional support.

644
01:30:43.103 --> 01:30:46.240
Cool. Very cool.

645
01:30:50.911 --> 01:30:55.716
125 grain,
1,425 feet per second.

646
01:30:55.816 --> 01:30:57.718
Serious business.

647
01:31:00.921 --> 01:31:02.389
Thank you.

648
01:31:02.489 --> 01:31:04.191
Let us begin.

649
01:32:50.264 --> 01:32:53.367
Charon, would you help set
the mood for our new guests?

650
01:32:54.034 --> 01:32:55.769
Of course, sir.

651
01:33:16.757 --> 01:33:19.760
I know you'll do
the Continental proud.

652
01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:21.528
I'll see you soon, sir.

653
01:33:24.298 --> 01:33:27.901
And you, Jonathan,
do what you do best.

654
01:33:28.001 --> 01:33:29.336
What's that?

655
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:31.471
Hunt.

656
01:37:04.918 --> 01:37:08.155
Winston! Winston!

657
01:37:12.225 --> 01:37:14.594
I need more firepower.

658
01:37:37.384 --> 01:37:39.286
Armor improvements.

659
01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:42.589
12-gauge steel slugs.
Armor-piercing.

660
01:41:09.796 --> 01:41:12.065
Only by my sword, John.

661
01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:26.379
I know you
believe you can keep this up.

662
01:41:26.479 --> 01:41:27.614
But I assure you...

663
01:49:32.732 --> 01:49:35.668
John, you're incredible.

664
01:49:36.602 --> 01:49:37.703
Exhausted,

665
01:49:38.104 --> 01:49:39.872
outnumbered...

666
01:49:39.972 --> 01:49:41.507
Obviously in pain.

667
01:49:42.441 --> 01:49:45.111
And you still beat
all of my students.

668
01:49:45.211 --> 01:49:47.313
If I didn't
have to kill you,

669
01:49:47.813 --> 01:49:50.316
we'd be pals.

670
01:49:50.850 --> 01:49:52.451
Let's do this.

671
01:50:19.979 --> 01:50:22.715
See? We're the same.

672
01:54:09.341 --> 01:54:12.011
I would like to suggest
a parley.

673
01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:13.746
A parley would be good.

674
01:54:13.846 --> 01:54:15.114
Very well.

675
01:54:26.225 --> 01:54:27.960
Are we in play, sir?

676
01:54:29.495 --> 01:54:30.963
Oh, very much so.

677
01:54:50.382 --> 01:54:52.117
Hey, John.

678
01:54:54.320 --> 01:54:56.856
That was
a pretty good fight, huh?

679
01:55:00.559 --> 01:55:01.961
Yeah.

680
01:55:31.390 --> 01:55:33.225
Yeah.

681
01:55:33.325 --> 01:55:36.729
Don't worry about me, John.

682
01:55:36.829 --> 01:55:39.131
I just gotta catch my breath.

683
01:55:40.833 --> 01:55:42.768
I'll catch up to you, John.

684
01:55:47.706 --> 01:55:49.875
No, you won't.

685
01:56:00.152 --> 01:56:01.353
You gentlemen, of course,

686
01:56:01.453 --> 01:56:03.589
realize that was
the first wave.

687
01:56:03.689 --> 01:56:06.025
Merely an amuse-bouche.

688
01:56:06.125 --> 01:56:07.760
We can keep this up
as long as you'd like,

689
01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:09.562
but it only ends one way.

690
01:56:09.662 --> 01:56:12.031
Are you sure a protracted war
is the best way forward?

691
01:56:12.131 --> 01:56:14.533
There won't be anything
"protracted" about it.

692
01:56:14.633 --> 01:56:15.768
Oh, you can take
the Continental,

693
01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:16.902
I have no doubt about that.

694
01:56:17.002 --> 01:56:19.238
But keeping it, that's
a different matter entirely.

695
01:56:19.338 --> 01:56:22.908
My allegiances run
way beyond this building.

696
01:56:23.576 --> 01:56:25.311
We are High Table.

697
01:56:25.978 --> 01:56:27.212
And we

698
01:56:28.347 --> 01:56:30.115
are New York City.

699
01:56:30.983 --> 01:56:32.818
Are we negotiating?

700
01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:35.955
Hmm.

701
01:56:36.488 --> 01:56:37.990
I believe we are.

702
01:56:43.629 --> 01:56:44.830
Parley?

703
01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:46.999
Parley.

704
01:56:50.235 --> 01:56:52.738
What do you propose we do?

705
01:56:56.675 --> 01:56:58.877
Let me keep my power.

706
01:56:59.311 --> 01:57:00.613
Under the Table.

707
01:57:03.382 --> 01:57:04.817
I have served

708
01:57:04.917 --> 01:57:07.720
and been a beacon
of order and stability

709
01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:09.788
to our industry
for over 40 years.

710
01:57:09.888 --> 01:57:12.224
Now, I humbly acknowledge
I overstepped

711
01:57:12.324 --> 01:57:15.628
and re-pledge my fealty
to the High Table.

712
01:57:17.997 --> 01:57:19.398
Winston.

713
01:57:24.937 --> 01:57:26.572
You were
merely showing strength

714
01:57:26.672 --> 01:57:29.274
so we would let you
keep the Continental.

715
01:57:32.778 --> 01:57:35.914
The High Table
accepts your fealty.

716
01:57:37.149 --> 01:57:38.651
But what about him?

717
01:57:40.586 --> 01:57:44.189
What are we going to do
about John Wick?

718
01:57:49.561 --> 01:57:51.330
Oh, he has to die.

719
01:57:52.731 --> 01:57:54.600
Sorry, Jonathan.
Winston!

720
01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:55.868
Don't see any other way.

721
01:58:07.846 --> 01:58:09.581
Very well, gentlemen.

722
01:58:09.682 --> 01:58:13.085
The Continental will now
be reconsecrated.

723
01:58:13.886 --> 01:58:15.954
Good day to you both.

724
01:58:19.725 --> 01:58:21.694
Well played, sir.

725
01:58:56.795 --> 01:58:59.698
How long do you estimate
until we reopen?

726
01:58:59.798 --> 01:59:01.734
Oh, should be no time at all.

727
01:59:05.537 --> 01:59:07.339
Mr. Wick is gone.

728
01:59:07.439 --> 01:59:09.274
A true tragedy.

729
01:59:09.374 --> 01:59:10.609
You misunderstand.

730
01:59:10.709 --> 01:59:13.579
I mean that he is no longer
on the street.

731
01:59:13.679 --> 01:59:14.747
That seems improbable.

732
01:59:14.847 --> 01:59:16.281
And yet, true.

733
01:59:17.783 --> 01:59:20.552
I trust you understand the
repercussions if he survives.

734
01:59:20.652 --> 01:59:22.821
Both from above and below.

735
01:59:22.921 --> 01:59:24.356
The last thing
either one of us needs

736
01:59:24.456 --> 01:59:27.092
is Mr. Wick paying us
a visit in the night.

737
01:59:29.595 --> 01:59:31.697
For both our sakes,
I'll hope you see to it

738
01:59:31.797 --> 01:59:33.966
that this situation
is taken care of, yes?

739
01:59:34.066 --> 01:59:38.036
Absolutely.
How far can he get?

740
01:59:49.648 --> 01:59:51.216
Baba Yaga.

741
02:00:03.662 --> 02:00:05.030
Mmm.

742
02:00:22.281 --> 02:00:24.716
How you doing, John?

743
02:00:24.817 --> 02:00:27.553
You look as bad as I feel.

744
02:00:29.454 --> 02:00:32.024
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.

745
02:00:32.124 --> 02:00:34.593
Raise a hand
if you can hear me, John.

746
02:00:37.129 --> 02:00:39.998
Oh, shit.
They took a finger.

747
02:00:40.098 --> 02:00:42.901
Ain't that a bitch?

748
02:00:48.140 --> 02:00:52.010
Oh, John fucking Wick.

749
02:00:52.110 --> 02:00:54.713
So, the old boy
keeps his hotel

750
02:00:54.813 --> 02:00:56.315
and you take the fall.

751
02:00:56.415 --> 02:00:57.482
Can't say I blame him.

752
02:00:57.583 --> 02:01:00.118
I would've done the same thing
if I was in his shoes.

753
02:01:00.853 --> 02:01:03.622
But this High Table shit...

754
02:01:06.625 --> 02:01:08.427
Seven cuts.

755
02:01:11.797 --> 02:01:14.600
Under the Table
is where shit gets done.

756
02:01:16.268 --> 02:01:19.171
And they're about to find out,
if you cut a king,

757
02:01:19.271 --> 02:01:21.874
you better cut him
to the quick.

758
02:01:26.378 --> 02:01:27.880
So...

759
02:01:30.182 --> 02:01:32.184
Let me ask you, John.

760
02:01:32.651 --> 02:01:33.886
How do you feel?

761
02:01:36.188 --> 02:01:40.659
'Cause I am really pissed off.

762
02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:43.295
You pissed, John?

763
02:01:43.395 --> 02:01:44.596
Hmm?

764
02:01:44.696 --> 02:01:46.031
Are you?

765
02:01:55.674 --> 02:01:57.442
Yeah.
