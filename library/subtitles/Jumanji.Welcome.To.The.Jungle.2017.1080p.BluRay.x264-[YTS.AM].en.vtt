00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.335
Hey, kiddo.

3
00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:27.504
- What?
- I found something.

4
00:01:27.506 --> 00:01:29.742
You gotta check this out.

5
00:01:31.342 --> 00:01:32.844
"Jumanji."

6
00:01:34.913 --> 00:01:36.046
Board game?

7
00:01:36.048 --> 00:01:38.585
Who plays board games?

8
00:03:12.586 --> 00:03:14.485
Parry. Parry.

9
00:03:14.487 --> 00:03:16.687
Evade. Blam.

10
00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:18.424
Uppercut.

11
00:03:18.426 --> 00:03:19.658
Head slam. You're dead.

12
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.462
Strike. Strike.
Counterstrike. Head slam.

13
00:03:22.464 --> 00:03:23.795
Ka-pow.

14
00:03:23.797 --> 00:03:26.931
<i>Get ready. Fight.</i>

15
00:03:26.933 --> 00:03:29.601
I got it.

16
00:03:39.113 --> 00:03:40.681
"...Benjamin Franklin,

17
00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:43.183
"and it was this sense
of national exceptionalism

18
00:03:43.185 --> 00:03:47.021
that fueled the spreading
wildfire of westward expansion."

19
00:03:47.023 --> 00:03:48.557
Spencer? Honey?

20
00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:51.993
Aah! Mom, what did we say
about the knocking?

21
00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:54.929
I'm late for work. You going
to your father's after school?

22
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:56.932
- Yeah, probably.
- Don't forget your EpiPen.

23
00:03:56.934 --> 00:03:59.066
Please, remember,
the world is terrifying.

24
00:03:59.068 --> 00:04:00.536
Be careful of everything.

25
00:04:00.538 --> 00:04:01.903
I love you
more than life itself. Bye.

26
00:04:01.905 --> 00:04:03.204
- See you Sunday night.
- Okay.

27
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:12.515
- Later, Mama.
- Eat something.

28
00:04:12.517 --> 00:04:13.916
I can't.
I gotta go meet Spencer.

29
00:04:13.918 --> 00:04:16.686
- Spencer Gilpin?
- Yeah, Spencer Gilpin.

30
00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:18.088
He's, uh...
He's been tutoring me.

31
00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.757
- He's helping get my grades up.
- I love to hear that.

32
00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:22.992
- Little Spencer Gilpin.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:22.994 --> 00:04:25.830
- Your grades gonna be okay?
- That's why I'm getting help.

34
00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:28.231
I'd hate for you
to get dropped from the team...

35
00:04:28.233 --> 00:04:30.503
I'm not gonna get dropped
from the team.

36
00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:34.608
It's... It's gonna
be fine. Okay?

37
00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:44.553
Mm.

38
00:04:53.728 --> 00:04:55.594
Okay.

39
00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.798
That's cute, right?

40
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.637
Yeah.

41
00:05:22.158 --> 00:05:24.496
- Yo.
- Hey, Fridge.

42
00:05:25.697 --> 00:05:27.597
Why you wearing a raincoat?

43
00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.898
- What do you mean?
- I mean, it's not raining.

44
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.667
Oh, well, it might.

45
00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.835
I mean, you never know
what's gonna happen.

46
00:05:35.674 --> 00:05:37.740
- Oy vey.
- What the hell, man?

47
00:05:37.742 --> 00:05:39.343
Do you mind?
Can we speed this up?

48
00:05:39.345 --> 00:05:41.911
Freak House makes me
very uncomfortable.

49
00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:43.884
Here you go.

50
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.618
- You proofread everything?
- Yeah, I proofed it.

51
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.722
And I gave it a beginning...

52
00:05:50.724 --> 00:05:53.058
and an ending
and s-some in the middle.

53
00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.926
I would've done it myself,
if I had the time or whatever,

54
00:05:55.928 --> 00:05:58.063
- but...
- Yeah, it's no big deal.

55
00:05:58.065 --> 00:06:01.099
Hey, man, I was thinking, so...
I mean, it's been really fun,

56
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:03.636
doing your papers
and your homework and stuff,

57
00:06:03.638 --> 00:06:05.871
but I don't know
what you're doing this weekend.

58
00:06:05.873 --> 00:06:08.773
- I was thinking maybe we could...
- This weekend. Yeah, ah...

59
00:06:08.775 --> 00:06:11.744
- Hey, Fridge.
- Hey.

60
00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.045
You need a ride?

61
00:06:14.047 --> 00:06:16.148
- I'm going with her.
- You know what?

62
00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:20.152
That's actually better for me,
scheduling-wise, too, so...

63
00:06:20.154 --> 00:06:21.957
See you later, Refrigerator.

64
00:06:22.957 --> 00:06:25.024
Sorry. Sorry.

65
00:06:25.026 --> 00:06:27.096
What up, girl?

66
00:06:28.631 --> 00:06:30.698
Whatever.

67
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:32.633
It's not like
I was your best friend

68
00:06:32.635 --> 00:06:33.835
for your entire childhood.

69
00:06:33.837 --> 00:06:35.403
- That's fine.
- What'd you say?

70
00:06:39.174 --> 00:06:40.844
Uh, nothing, sir.

71
00:06:42.278 --> 00:06:44.279
Oh, that guy is super weird.

72
00:06:44.281 --> 00:06:46.081
That poor man.

73
00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:48.820
So awful what happened
to those people.

74
00:06:49.688 --> 00:06:51.688
I was talking about the kid.

75
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:52.955
What are you doing out here?

76
00:06:52.957 --> 00:06:54.827
I was just talking
to my friend.

77
00:06:56.094 --> 00:06:57.293
You should be more careful

78
00:06:57.295 --> 00:06:58.794
where you loiter,
you hear me?

79
00:06:58.796 --> 00:07:00.796
Yes, Mr. Vreeke. I hear you.

80
00:07:00.798 --> 00:07:03.737
This world swallows up
kids like you.

81
00:07:21.321 --> 00:07:23.889
It's been over two
hours since I've posted,

82
00:07:23.891 --> 00:07:26.024
and he hasn't commented.
He hasn't even liked it.

83
00:07:26.026 --> 00:07:28.193
- You saw it.
<i>- Yeah, gorge.</i>

84
00:07:28.195 --> 00:07:30.028
<i>I don't know
what his problem is.</i>

85
00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:32.165
Thank you. It's not like
I post all the time,

86
00:07:32.167 --> 00:07:33.766
just enough
to stay relevant.

87
00:07:33.768 --> 00:07:35.201
But it's cute enough
for Noah to...

88
00:07:35.203 --> 00:07:37.239
<i>Hey, there's
some rando behind you.</i>

89
00:07:38.708 --> 00:07:40.973
- Hi.
- Hi.

90
00:07:40.975 --> 00:07:43.911
Bethany, did you just make
a call during a quiz?

91
00:07:43.913 --> 00:07:45.446
Yeah. But I finished
my quiz already.

92
00:07:45.448 --> 00:07:49.719
Oh, okay. Well, have you noticed
that other people haven't?

93
00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:53.888
- So?
- Oh, I'm sorry. Let me back up.

94
00:07:53.890 --> 00:07:57.224
You're aware there are other
people in the world, right?

95
00:07:58.396 --> 00:08:00.463
Look, um, you know,

96
00:08:00.465 --> 00:08:03.030
I'm dealing with something
right now,

97
00:08:03.032 --> 00:08:05.033
and I'm no happier
about it than you are.

98
00:08:05.035 --> 00:08:07.802
I'm having a crisis,
and Lucinda, I mean,

99
00:08:07.804 --> 00:08:09.472
she's supporting me
as a woman,

100
00:08:09.474 --> 00:08:11.809
and it feels like
maybe you should too.

101
00:08:13.076 --> 00:08:15.344
- Just hang up the phone.
- Okay, I'll wrap it up.

102
00:08:15.346 --> 00:08:18.347
- Bethany, hang it up now.
- Two minutes and we're done.

103
00:08:18.349 --> 00:08:20.217
And that's detention.

104
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.156
All right, keep
those arms pumping.

105
00:08:25.187 --> 00:08:25.756
Let's go!

106
00:08:25.758 --> 00:08:27.123
Bethany, you're late.

107
00:08:27.125 --> 00:08:28.261
Sorry.

108
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:33.097
I heard she broke up
with that football guy.

109
00:08:33.099 --> 00:08:36.066
This could be
your opening, Fussfeld.

110
00:08:36.068 --> 00:08:38.235
We're gonna practice

111
00:08:38.237 --> 00:08:39.505
catching and throwing.

112
00:08:39.507 --> 00:08:43.011
So partner up and grab
a football. Let's move!

113
00:08:45.346 --> 00:08:46.512
Hey, Martha.

114
00:08:46.514 --> 00:08:50.082
Martha. You can't
play catch by yourself.

115
00:08:50.084 --> 00:08:51.785
Pair up.

116
00:08:51.787 --> 00:08:53.352
Come on. Let's go.

117
00:08:53.354 --> 00:08:55.224
No. No, I'm good.

118
00:08:56.123 --> 00:08:57.290
Okay.

119
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:03.964
You have to participate
just like everybody else.

120
00:09:03.966 --> 00:09:06.266
Otherwise,
why are you even here?

121
00:09:06.268 --> 00:09:07.501
It's a requirement.

122
00:09:07.503 --> 00:09:09.136
- Martha...
- I think it's pointless.

123
00:09:09.138 --> 00:09:11.204
Gym class is not gonna get me
into Princeton,

124
00:09:11.206 --> 00:09:13.340
and I don't understand
the obsession with throwing

125
00:09:13.342 --> 00:09:15.976
a ball into a hoop
and, "Touchdown, five points!"

126
00:09:15.978 --> 00:09:19.080
Okay. There's a lot wrong
with that, but first of all...

127
00:09:19.082 --> 00:09:21.249
It's physical activity,
which is good for you.

128
00:09:21.251 --> 00:09:23.451
With other people,
also good for you.

129
00:09:23.453 --> 00:09:27.088
And if you try it,
you might even have some fun.

130
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:29.558
Fun. That's what
we're doing here? Fun?

131
00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.260
This is school.

132
00:09:31.262 --> 00:09:33.895
We are supposed to be
learning things that matter.

133
00:09:33.897 --> 00:09:35.197
- Okay, Martha...
- We don't have

134
00:09:35.199 --> 00:09:37.300
a lot of time in this life,
and I personally

135
00:09:37.302 --> 00:09:40.806
don't wanna waste it on being,
like, a gym teacher.

136
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.009
- That... That came out wrong.
- Yeah, it sure did.

137
00:09:46.011 --> 00:09:47.847
That's detention.

138
00:09:48.914 --> 00:09:51.583
That was hard-core.

139
00:09:51.585 --> 00:09:53.483
Badass.

140
00:09:53.485 --> 00:09:56.290
Spencer Gilpin?

141
00:09:59.527 --> 00:10:00.995
Have a seat, Spencer.

142
00:10:11.472 --> 00:10:13.071
Miss Mathers?

143
00:10:13.073 --> 00:10:15.575
"And it was this sense
of national exceptionalism

144
00:10:15.577 --> 00:10:19.613
that fueled the spreading
wildfire of westward expansion."

145
00:10:19.615 --> 00:10:22.352
Does that sound familiar,
Mr. Gilpin?

146
00:10:24.218 --> 00:10:26.888
- It does not.
- It's the last sentence

147
00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:29.090
of Anthony's paper
on westward expansion.

148
00:10:29.092 --> 00:10:31.558
And, coincidentally,
it's the last sentence

149
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.931
of your paper on westward
expansion from last year.

150
00:10:37.634 --> 00:10:39.500
That's interesting.

151
00:10:39.502 --> 00:10:41.270
Is it?

152
00:10:41.272 --> 00:10:44.539
I think so. I mean,
what are the odds of that?

153
00:10:44.541 --> 00:10:46.173
Slim.

154
00:10:46.175 --> 00:10:49.111
Yeah, you also
used the same metaphor:

155
00:10:49.113 --> 00:10:51.246
"the spreading wildfire,"
in your papers

156
00:10:51.249 --> 00:10:54.983
on the Boston Tea Party,
the Battle of Gettysburg,

157
00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:57.289
and the women's suffrage
movement.

158
00:10:59.925 --> 00:11:02.358
It's so hot in this room.

159
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.129
Anthony, I know how much
you need to pass my class,

160
00:11:06.131 --> 00:11:07.531
but this is not
how you do it.

161
00:11:07.533 --> 00:11:10.268
- I will not tolerate cheating.
- Cheating?

162
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.436
I didn't... I didn't...
I didn't cheat.

163
00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:13.874
It was my fault.

164
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.008
I made him do it.

165
00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:22.216
You made him...
have you write his paper?

166
00:11:23.418 --> 00:11:25.149
Yeah.

167
00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:26.686
Mm-hm.

168
00:11:29.089 --> 00:11:32.158
Look.
I'm sorry, okay?

169
00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:34.294
No, no,
it's not okay.

170
00:11:34.296 --> 00:11:37.028
What the hell, man?
You got me kicked off the team.

171
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:39.130
Yeah, well, you could've
gotten me expelled.

172
00:11:39.132 --> 00:11:42.034
It's not like you're the only
one who's living dangerously.

173
00:11:42.036 --> 00:11:43.502
- Living dangerously?
- Yes.

174
00:11:43.504 --> 00:11:47.240
This is the most dangerous thing
I've ever done in my life.

175
00:11:47.242 --> 00:11:50.344
And now look at me.
I'm paying the price.

176
00:11:51.715 --> 00:11:53.046
Well...

177
00:11:53.048 --> 00:11:55.116
isn't this a fun group?

178
00:11:55.118 --> 00:11:58.055
Welcome to detention.

179
00:11:58.620 --> 00:11:59.655
Yes, Spencer?

180
00:11:59.657 --> 00:12:01.290
I wanna say that I'm sorry.

181
00:12:01.292 --> 00:12:03.658
- Thank you.
- Bentley, all I did was make...

182
00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:06.195
Bethany, please.
You're all here for a reason.

183
00:12:06.197 --> 00:12:07.496
You know what it is.

184
00:12:07.498 --> 00:12:09.732
But this is what
you should be thinking about:

185
00:12:09.734 --> 00:12:12.767
Who you are...

186
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:14.537
in this moment in time,

187
00:12:14.539 --> 00:12:17.474
and who you want to be.

188
00:12:17.476 --> 00:12:19.776
You get one life.

189
00:12:19.778 --> 00:12:22.144
You decide
how you're gonna spend it.

190
00:12:24.015 --> 00:12:25.649
Fortunately...

191
00:12:25.651 --> 00:12:28.686
there is no better place
for self-reflection

192
00:12:28.688 --> 00:12:30.154
than detention.

193
00:12:30.156 --> 00:12:32.992
Get up, everybody. Let's go.

194
00:12:45.373 --> 00:12:47.672
We are turning this
into a new computer center.

195
00:12:47.674 --> 00:12:50.309
But before we do,
it has to be cleaned out.

196
00:12:50.311 --> 00:12:53.111
These old magazines are bound
for the recycling plant.

197
00:12:53.113 --> 00:12:55.714
But they have to be prepped
before they go.

198
00:12:55.716 --> 00:12:59.552
It seems all the staples
must be removed.

199
00:12:59.554 --> 00:13:02.455
Whatever you don't finish today,
you finish tomorrow.

200
00:13:02.457 --> 00:13:04.590
- Tomorrow's Saturday.
- Because I wouldn't play?

201
00:13:04.592 --> 00:13:06.560
- I don't think that'll work.
- That's fair.

202
00:13:06.562 --> 00:13:10.663
- Shut up.
- So I suggest you get started.

203
00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.202
Choose your weapons.

204
00:13:18.541 --> 00:13:21.443
Hey, what the hell
they need with a bowling ball?

205
00:13:22.679 --> 00:13:24.547
Seriously, no reception?

206
00:13:24.549 --> 00:13:28.182
- Okay, can today get any worse?
- Are you gonna help?

207
00:13:28.184 --> 00:13:29.652
Or are you too pretty?

208
00:13:29.654 --> 00:13:31.553
I'm too pretty.

209
00:13:36.461 --> 00:13:39.395
Hey. I was watching you
with Coach Web today.

210
00:13:39.397 --> 00:13:41.264
I wasn't watching you,
I wasn't...

211
00:13:41.266 --> 00:13:42.866
Not, like, in a weird way.
I just...

212
00:13:42.868 --> 00:13:44.800
I was in the room.
We're in the same class.

213
00:13:44.802 --> 00:13:47.871
Um, but I thought you were
saying some really smart things

214
00:13:47.873 --> 00:13:51.174
about why P.E. sucks
and, um...

215
00:13:51.176 --> 00:13:53.343
about other subjects.

216
00:13:53.345 --> 00:13:55.481
Thanks.

217
00:13:56.515 --> 00:13:58.117
Yeah.

218
00:14:02.622 --> 00:14:04.522
Yo. What's this?

219
00:14:06.192 --> 00:14:08.192
- I don't know.
- What is it, like,

220
00:14:08.194 --> 00:14:10.529
some type of old-school
Nintendo or something?

221
00:14:10.531 --> 00:14:12.264
I don't think so.

222
00:14:12.266 --> 00:14:14.335
I don't recognize it.

223
00:14:31.887 --> 00:14:34.688
"A game for those
who seek to find...

224
00:14:34.690 --> 00:14:37.559
"a way to leave
their world behind.

225
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.695
Jumanji."

226
00:14:41.697 --> 00:14:43.298
Staples, people. Staples.

227
00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:44.632
"Jumanji"?
What does that mean?

228
00:14:44.634 --> 00:14:46.668
I have no idea.
Never heard of it.

229
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.238
Hm...

230
00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.742
Uh, which one do I pick?

231
00:14:52.744 --> 00:14:55.377
I don't know. I don't
think it matters that much.

232
00:14:55.379 --> 00:14:58.180
"Jefferson 'Seaplane' McDonough.

233
00:14:58.182 --> 00:15:00.450
Pilot and rascal."

234
00:15:00.452 --> 00:15:03.420
- It's not working.
- Okay, try another one.

235
00:15:03.422 --> 00:15:06.190
"Franklin 'Moose' Finbar."

236
00:15:06.192 --> 00:15:07.657
Hm.

237
00:15:07.659 --> 00:15:08.926
He sounds like a badass.

238
00:15:08.928 --> 00:15:12.366
And he's a zoology expert,
which is awesome.

239
00:15:15.267 --> 00:15:17.136
- You pick.
- Okay.

240
00:15:18.438 --> 00:15:21.641
"Dr. Smolder Bravestone."

241
00:15:24.512 --> 00:15:26.578
Bethany, you in?

242
00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.181
Fine.

243
00:15:31.219 --> 00:15:32.550
I'll be...

244
00:15:32.552 --> 00:15:34.687
Shelly Oberon...

245
00:15:34.689 --> 00:15:35.987
the curvy genius.

246
00:15:37.558 --> 00:15:39.825
Hey, yo, Staples, come on.
It's your turn.

247
00:15:39.827 --> 00:15:41.328
Uh, no.

248
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:43.829
- No, thanks.
- Wait. Just for a few minutes?

249
00:15:43.831 --> 00:15:45.832
It'll be fun.

250
00:15:45.834 --> 00:15:47.236
She's not big on fun.

251
00:15:50.572 --> 00:15:53.309
Okay. Fine.

252
00:15:56.245 --> 00:15:59.447
This may be the
lamest thing I've ever done.

253
00:15:59.449 --> 00:16:02.250
I highly doubt that.

254
00:16:06.991 --> 00:16:09.593
<i>Welcome to Jumanji!</i>

255
00:16:20.339 --> 00:16:21.404
What's going on?

256
00:16:24.776 --> 00:16:26.345
I think it's shorting out.

257
00:16:33.018 --> 00:16:35.288
Unplug it!

258
00:16:39.359 --> 00:16:41.629
Whoa!

259
00:16:43.297 --> 00:16:45.563
What's going on?
What's happening to your hands?

260
00:16:45.565 --> 00:16:47.835
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

261
00:16:51.673 --> 00:16:52.673
Spencer!

262
00:16:53.975 --> 00:16:55.074
Oh, my God!

263
00:16:55.076 --> 00:16:57.646
Oh-oh-oh...

264
00:17:01.784 --> 00:17:03.049
Aah!

265
00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.919
What the hell, man?

266
00:17:05.921 --> 00:17:07.421
Oh, no.

267
00:17:07.423 --> 00:17:11.295
Holy shit...

268
00:17:18.033 --> 00:17:19.933
Whoa!

269
00:17:22.071 --> 00:17:24.541
Aah.

270
00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:46.762
Guys?

271
00:17:46.764 --> 00:17:50.469
Guys? Why do I
sound like this?

272
00:17:57.709 --> 00:17:59.346
Where's my hair?

273
00:18:09.622 --> 00:18:11.723
What the...?

274
00:18:11.725 --> 00:18:13.529
Oh, God!

275
00:18:15.997 --> 00:18:17.429
Ow, unh.

276
00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:32.482
Huh?

277
00:18:34.583 --> 00:18:36.048
Oh...

278
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:38.655
What kind of stupid-ass...?

279
00:18:40.624 --> 00:18:42.891
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

280
00:18:45.095 --> 00:18:46.528
Who is she?

281
00:18:46.530 --> 00:18:49.664
Who are you guys? Huh?

282
00:18:49.666 --> 00:18:51.633
Okay, what the hell?

283
00:18:51.635 --> 00:18:53.469
God! Oh, my God!

284
00:18:53.471 --> 00:18:54.903
- Get off of me!
- I am suing...

285
00:18:54.905 --> 00:18:57.573
- What's wrong with my voice?
- Get off of me!

286
00:18:57.575 --> 00:18:59.978
- Where am I?
- You're crushing me! Get off!

287
00:19:01.179 --> 00:19:02.682
Get...

288
00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:11.655
What the hell?
What happened to the rest of me?

289
00:19:11.657 --> 00:19:14.191
What is this?
What is this on my back?

290
00:19:14.193 --> 00:19:15.191
What is this?

291
00:19:15.193 --> 00:19:17.662
Oh, my God.

292
00:19:17.664 --> 00:19:18.664
Fridge?

293
00:19:19.898 --> 00:19:21.968
Yeah, I'm Fridge.
Who are you?

294
00:19:26.071 --> 00:19:27.505
I'm Spencer.

295
00:19:27.507 --> 00:19:32.077
What? The hell you are.
What is going on? Huh?

296
00:19:32.079 --> 00:19:33.878
I think...

297
00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:35.079
we're in the game.

298
00:19:35.081 --> 00:19:37.516
- Sorry, excuse me?
- What are you talking about?

299
00:19:37.518 --> 00:19:39.117
Somehow, I don't know how...

300
00:19:39.119 --> 00:19:42.521
I think we got, like,
sucked into the game.

301
00:19:42.523 --> 00:19:44.691
And we've become the avatars
that we chose.

302
00:19:44.693 --> 00:19:48.227
So it's me, Spencer,
but yet I look and sound...

303
00:19:48.229 --> 00:19:52.435
like Dr. Smolder Bravestone.

304
00:19:57.806 --> 00:19:59.807
You're telling me
that you're Spencer?

305
00:19:59.809 --> 00:20:01.709
Yes, yes, yes. That's it.

306
00:20:01.711 --> 00:20:05.580
Fridge, I'm Spencer.
Which means you're Moose Finbar.

307
00:20:05.582 --> 00:20:07.919
It says it right there
on your vest. And...

308
00:20:09.119 --> 00:20:10.651
- Martha?
- Yeah.

309
00:20:10.653 --> 00:20:12.853
You're Ruby Roundhouse.

310
00:20:12.855 --> 00:20:16.659
And, Bethany,
you're Professor Shelly Oberon.

311
00:20:16.661 --> 00:20:18.593
Only Shelly must be
short for Sheldon.

312
00:20:18.595 --> 00:20:19.861
What are you talking about?

313
00:20:19.863 --> 00:20:21.898
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's right.

314
00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:24.166
And you...

315
00:20:24.168 --> 00:20:26.235
you're Spencer? You?

316
00:20:26.237 --> 00:20:27.770
Yes. Guys, I'm telling you.

317
00:20:27.772 --> 00:20:30.140
I am Spencer. I'm... Aah!

318
00:20:30.142 --> 00:20:31.641
Yep, that's Spencer.

319
00:20:31.643 --> 00:20:33.176
Whoa. Whoa!

320
00:20:33.178 --> 00:20:35.746
So that means I...

321
00:20:35.748 --> 00:20:37.083
I'm...

322
00:20:38.785 --> 00:20:40.684
Wait, Bethany.
Bethany, don't!

323
00:20:40.686 --> 00:20:43.523
No!

324
00:20:46.625 --> 00:20:48.995
I'm an overweight,
middle-aged man.

325
00:20:49.996 --> 00:20:51.697
Uh, I have a tattoo.

326
00:20:51.699 --> 00:20:54.566
My mom always said she'd
kill me if I ever got a tattoo.

327
00:20:54.568 --> 00:20:55.934
What is this?

328
00:20:55.936 --> 00:20:57.638
I have one too.

329
00:21:00.174 --> 00:21:01.307
Sometimes.

330
00:21:01.309 --> 00:21:03.676
Wait a second.

331
00:21:03.678 --> 00:21:06.145
Where's my phone?

332
00:21:07.915 --> 00:21:09.583
Aah.

333
00:21:09.585 --> 00:21:11.652
Why am I wearing this outfit
in a jungle?

334
00:21:11.654 --> 00:21:14.054
Tiny, little shorts
and a leather halter top.

335
00:21:14.056 --> 00:21:15.623
I mean, what is this?

336
00:21:15.625 --> 00:21:17.991
I look like a living
garden gnome. Where is my phone?

337
00:21:17.993 --> 00:21:20.595
- Who cares?
- We are in different bodies!

338
00:21:20.597 --> 00:21:23.029
It doesn't seem like
the most pressing concern

339
00:21:23.031 --> 00:21:24.965
- at this moment.
- Really? You don't think

340
00:21:24.967 --> 00:21:27.033
this would be a good moment
to make a call

341
00:21:27.035 --> 00:21:28.936
or text somebody
or change your status

342
00:21:28.938 --> 00:21:30.271
to "stuck in
a video game"?

343
00:21:30.273 --> 00:21:33.675
All I'm saying is,
I don't have my Claritin, okay?

344
00:21:33.677 --> 00:21:35.611
And I'm allergic to
almost everything.

345
00:21:35.613 --> 00:21:36.944
Oh, no.

346
00:21:36.946 --> 00:21:39.682
You got allergies,
Spencer? Huh?

347
00:21:39.684 --> 00:21:41.684
I don't have the top two feet
of my body!

348
00:21:41.686 --> 00:21:44.387
You guys, this can't
actually be happening.

349
00:21:44.389 --> 00:21:46.955
Maybe we're all in a coma.

350
00:21:46.957 --> 00:21:49.926
Together?
We're all in a coma together?

351
00:21:49.928 --> 00:21:52.227
It's the only explanation.
That old game machine

352
00:21:52.229 --> 00:21:54.732
must have electrocuted us,
and now we're...

353
00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:59.736
- Oh, my God, Bethany!
- Oh, my God, oh, my God!

354
00:21:59.738 --> 00:22:01.105
Stop it!

355
00:22:08.047 --> 00:22:10.982
Oh, my God! You better get
in there and go save her.

356
00:22:10.984 --> 00:22:12.883
I'm not getting in there!
You get in.

357
00:22:12.885 --> 00:22:14.919
I'm not going anywhere.
I got a backpack on.

358
00:22:14.921 --> 00:22:17.657
You don't get in water with a
backpack. Everybody knows that.

359
00:22:25.999 --> 00:22:26.931
Ow!

360
00:22:26.933 --> 00:22:28.133
What the...?

361
00:22:28.135 --> 00:22:30.739
- Bethany!
- What just...?

362
00:22:32.141 --> 00:22:33.373
Are you okay?

363
00:22:33.375 --> 00:22:35.741
That was so intense.

364
00:22:35.743 --> 00:22:37.711
I, like, can't even
with this place.

365
00:22:37.713 --> 00:22:40.014
- What just happened to you?
- I got eaten by a rhino,

366
00:22:40.016 --> 00:22:42.749
and then I fell, like,
a thousand feet from the sky.

367
00:22:42.751 --> 00:22:44.451
Yeah, that's what
it looked like.

368
00:22:44.453 --> 00:22:46.355
That was a hippo.
They're omnivorous.

369
00:22:46.357 --> 00:22:48.855
They're fast as a horse
over short distances,

370
00:22:48.857 --> 00:22:51.227
and they have the bite force
of 8100 newtons.

371
00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:53.161
How do I know this?

372
00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:54.697
You're an expert in zoology.

373
00:22:54.699 --> 00:22:56.464
- What?
- I'm still an old fat guy, right?

374
00:22:56.466 --> 00:22:59.000
- I'm afraid so.
- Wait.

375
00:22:59.002 --> 00:23:03.272
Why is everybody okay with this?
I mean, she fell out of the sky.

376
00:23:03.274 --> 00:23:04.877
Um, guys?

377
00:23:08.446 --> 00:23:12.482
Bethany, get up.
Bethany, get up. Get up!

378
00:23:18.291 --> 00:23:19.824
Go, go, go!

379
00:23:19.826 --> 00:23:22.026
Go, go, go!

380
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:28.936
Ah! Dr. Bravestone!
Welcome to Jumanji!

381
00:23:30.771 --> 00:23:33.339
Don't just stand there.
In you go.

382
00:23:33.341 --> 00:23:35.107
- Go, go, go.
- Yeah.

383
00:23:47.088 --> 00:23:48.421
Dr. Bravestone.

384
00:23:48.423 --> 00:23:51.457
Famed archaeologist
and international explorer.

385
00:23:51.459 --> 00:23:53.092
Known across
the seven continents

386
00:23:53.094 --> 00:23:54.962
for your courageous exploits.

387
00:23:54.964 --> 00:23:56.929
Is there a seat belt?

388
00:23:56.931 --> 00:24:00.033
I can't tell you what an honor
it is to finally meet you.

389
00:24:00.035 --> 00:24:03.370
I'm not embarrassed to say
you're more dashing in person.

390
00:24:03.372 --> 00:24:05.406
Um, thanks.

391
00:24:05.408 --> 00:24:06.507
Who are you?

392
00:24:06.509 --> 00:24:08.142
Nigel Billingsly
at your service,

393
00:24:08.144 --> 00:24:10.411
Ruby Roundhouse,
killer of men.

394
00:24:10.413 --> 00:24:12.112
Welcome to Jumanji.

395
00:24:12.114 --> 00:24:15.351
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

396
00:24:15.353 --> 00:24:17.452
As you know,
Jumanji is in grave danger.

397
00:24:17.454 --> 00:24:20.356
We're counting on the four
of you to lift the curse.

398
00:24:20.358 --> 00:24:22.091
- Curse?
- What curse?

399
00:24:22.093 --> 00:24:25.261
Excuse me.
Have you seen my phone anywhere?

400
00:24:25.263 --> 00:24:27.863
Professor Sheldon Oberon.

401
00:24:27.865 --> 00:24:29.399
Welcome to Jumanji.

402
00:24:29.401 --> 00:24:31.334
Nigel Billingsly
at your service.

403
00:24:31.336 --> 00:24:33.937
I've been so anxious
for your arrival.

404
00:24:33.939 --> 00:24:35.472
What's with this guy?

405
00:24:35.474 --> 00:24:37.275
I think he's an NPC.

406
00:24:37.277 --> 00:24:38.809
A what? English, please.

407
00:24:38.811 --> 00:24:40.912
A non-player character.
He's part of the game.

408
00:24:40.914 --> 00:24:42.279
So anything we ask him,

409
00:24:42.281 --> 00:24:44.582
he only has his programmed
series of responses.

410
00:24:44.584 --> 00:24:46.317
Got it. It's all clear now.

411
00:24:46.319 --> 00:24:48.519
Franklin "Mouse" Finbar.

412
00:24:48.521 --> 00:24:50.086
Welcome to Jumanji.

413
00:24:50.088 --> 00:24:51.923
It's Moose. It's not Mouse.

414
00:24:51.925 --> 00:24:54.425
No, good sir.
I'm quite sure it's Mouse.

415
00:24:54.427 --> 00:24:55.993
- Mouse?
- A nickname given

416
00:24:55.995 --> 00:24:58.864
for your diminutive stature
and adorable manner.

417
00:24:58.866 --> 00:25:00.031
I knew you'd be here.

418
00:25:00.033 --> 00:25:01.866
Dr. Bravestone
doesn't go anywhere

419
00:25:01.868 --> 00:25:03.569
without his trusty sidekick.

420
00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:05.170
Sidekick?

421
00:25:05.172 --> 00:25:07.173
Ever since Dr. Bravestone
rescued you

422
00:25:07.175 --> 00:25:08.575
from the clutches
of a warlord

423
00:25:08.577 --> 00:25:11.412
in the jungles of Peru,
you've never left his side.

424
00:25:11.414 --> 00:25:12.579
Right.

425
00:25:12.581 --> 00:25:14.315
Can we go back
to the curse thing?

426
00:25:14.317 --> 00:25:16.850
It's all documented
in the letter I sent you.

427
00:25:16.852 --> 00:25:18.452
Perhaps you should
read it aloud.

428
00:25:18.454 --> 00:25:20.023
I don't have a let...

429
00:25:23.427 --> 00:25:24.427
Whoa.

430
00:25:28.297 --> 00:25:29.998
Right, uh...

431
00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.334
"Dr. Bravestone,
I am writing to you

432
00:25:32.336 --> 00:25:34.436
"regarding
the desperate situation

433
00:25:34.438 --> 00:25:37.239
In Jumanji.
We need your help at once."

434
00:25:37.241 --> 00:25:40.207
<i>- Whoa... Guys?
- What's happening?</i>

435
00:25:40.209 --> 00:25:42.177
<i>What the hell is going on?</i>

436
00:25:42.179 --> 00:25:44.546
<i>It's a cut scene.
A lot of games have them.</i>

437
00:25:44.548 --> 00:25:47.350
<i>It's like a little movie
to tell you the back-story.</i>

438
00:25:47.352 --> 00:25:49.453
<i>My name is
Nigel Billingsly,</i>

439
00:25:49.455 --> 00:25:51.955
<i>Jumanji field guide.</i>

440
00:25:51.957 --> 00:25:54.024
<i>I was hired
by your former partner,</i>

441
00:25:54.026 --> 00:25:56.659
<i>now nemesis,
Professor Russel Van Pelt</i>

442
00:25:56.661 --> 00:25:58.399
<i>to lead
a fateful expedition.</i>

443
00:26:02.101 --> 00:26:04.167
<i>You see,
Professor Van Pelt</i>

444
00:26:04.169 --> 00:26:06.504
<i>had come in search
of the fabled Jaguar Shrine,</i>

445
00:26:06.506 --> 00:26:10.173
<i>resting place
of the sacred jewel of Jumanji.</i>

446
00:26:10.175 --> 00:26:12.209
<i>As you know
better than anyone,</i>

447
00:26:12.211 --> 00:26:14.044
<i>the jewel was his
great obsession.</i>

448
00:26:14.046 --> 00:26:16.246
<i>And after years of research,
he believed</i>

449
00:26:16.249 --> 00:26:18.249
<i>that he had discovered
its whereabouts.</i>

450
00:26:18.251 --> 00:26:20.018
Could it be?

451
00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:22.121
Have I finally found it?

452
00:26:22.123 --> 00:26:25.325
<i>Van Pelt told me that
he wanted to find the jewel</i>

453
00:26:25.327 --> 00:26:28.028
<i>in order to document it
in his writings.</i>

454
00:26:30.265 --> 00:26:32.598
- It's real!
<i>- What I did not know</i>

455
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.439
<i>was that he intended
to take the jewel for himself.</i>

456
00:26:45.382 --> 00:26:48.015
I found it.

457
00:26:48.017 --> 00:26:52.155
I found it!

458
00:26:53.691 --> 00:26:57.159
<i>Legend tells that the
Jaguar watches over Jumanji</i>

459
00:26:57.161 --> 00:26:59.328
<i>and anyone who dares
to blind him</i>

460
00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:02.901
<i>will be consumed
by a dark power.</i>

461
00:27:04.033 --> 00:27:06.035
<i>Van Pelt assumed dominion</i>

462
00:27:06.037 --> 00:27:08.136
<i>over all
of Jumanji's creatures,</i>

463
00:27:08.138 --> 00:27:11.442
<i>possessing them,
controlling them.</i>

464
00:27:11.444 --> 00:27:16.048
<i>And a terrible curse befell
this once-placid land.</i>

465
00:27:17.449 --> 00:27:19.482
<i>I begged him
to put it back,</i>

466
00:27:19.484 --> 00:27:21.617
<i>but once he had it
in his grasp,</i>

467
00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:25.423
<i>he could never let it go.</i>

468
00:27:25.425 --> 00:27:28.560
<i>So I waited
till they slept that night,</i>

469
00:27:28.562 --> 00:27:30.298
<i>and I made my move.</i>

470
00:27:52.152 --> 00:27:54.487
Bring me that jewel!

471
00:27:54.489 --> 00:27:58.093
And slaughter anyone
who tries to stop you.

472
00:27:59.128 --> 00:28:01.164
Right, then. Here you go.

473
00:28:02.498 --> 00:28:05.033
With the invaluable help
of your associates,

474
00:28:05.035 --> 00:28:06.801
you must use your
complementary skills

475
00:28:06.803 --> 00:28:08.769
to return the jewel
to the Jaguar's eye

476
00:28:08.771 --> 00:28:11.139
and lift the curse.

477
00:28:11.141 --> 00:28:13.475
I'm sure you'll want
to get started right away.

478
00:28:13.477 --> 00:28:15.376
- Actually, I think...
- Good luck!

479
00:28:15.378 --> 00:28:17.513
The fate of Jumanji
is in your hands.

480
00:28:19.450 --> 00:28:21.182
- What? Oh...
- And remember:

481
00:28:21.184 --> 00:28:23.420
<i>The goal for you,
I'll recite in verse</i>

482
00:28:23.422 --> 00:28:26.055
<i>Return the jewel
and lift the curse</i>

483
00:28:26.057 --> 00:28:27.623
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

484
00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:32.194
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

485
00:28:32.196 --> 00:28:35.164
Good luck! The fate
of Jumanji is in your hands.

486
00:28:35.166 --> 00:28:37.500
- And remember:
- He's saying the same thing over.

487
00:28:37.502 --> 00:28:39.134
<i>I'll recite in verse</i>

488
00:28:39.136 --> 00:28:41.271
<i>Return the jewel
and lift the curse</i>

489
00:28:41.273 --> 00:28:42.472
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

490
00:28:42.474 --> 00:28:46.546
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

491
00:28:49.450 --> 00:28:53.217
It's okay. You can handle this.
In real life, people love you.

492
00:28:53.219 --> 00:28:54.752
You can hook up
with anyone you want.

493
00:28:54.754 --> 00:28:57.423
Is that what you tell yourself
when you're scared?

494
00:28:57.425 --> 00:28:59.790
Can you not judge me
for two seconds?

495
00:28:59.792 --> 00:29:01.828
I split up with Noah,
I turned into a guy,

496
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:04.563
and I cannot find my phone.
I am allowed to be upset.

497
00:29:04.565 --> 00:29:07.700
Dr. Bravestone,
here's a map of Jumanji.

498
00:29:07.702 --> 00:29:10.471
You must go to the bazaar
and find the missing piece.

499
00:29:10.473 --> 00:29:12.539
- The bazaar.
- Missing piece of what?

500
00:29:12.541 --> 00:29:14.541
- Cheerio!
- You can't give us a ride

501
00:29:14.543 --> 00:29:16.510
- to the statue?
- And remember:

502
00:29:16.512 --> 00:29:18.479
<i>If you wish
to leave the game</i>

503
00:29:18.481 --> 00:29:22.420
<i>You must save Jumanji
And call out its name</i>

504
00:29:29.659 --> 00:29:33.227
- You want to, uh, put this in there?
- No.

505
00:29:33.229 --> 00:29:36.300
Come on, you're the only one
with a backpack, Fridge.

506
00:29:37.267 --> 00:29:38.868
So what? We have a map.

507
00:29:38.870 --> 00:29:40.869
So now we're supposed
to go and find...?

508
00:29:40.871 --> 00:29:42.370
The bazaar, I guess?

509
00:29:42.372 --> 00:29:45.307
So we return the jewel
to the Jaguar statue,

510
00:29:45.309 --> 00:29:47.842
and then we go home.
No problem.

511
00:29:47.844 --> 00:29:49.778
Why can't we just leave,
stop the game,

512
00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.848
without doing
all this stuff?

513
00:29:51.850 --> 00:29:54.353
We have to finish the game.

514
00:29:55.586 --> 00:29:57.257
I think...

515
00:29:58.423 --> 00:30:01.360
I think we
have to save Jumanji.

516
00:30:09.403 --> 00:30:12.440
Damn, that is a man
right there.

517
00:30:14.607 --> 00:30:18.844
Don't
cry, don't cry, don't cry.

518
00:30:18.846 --> 00:30:19.911
Don't cry.

519
00:30:19.913 --> 00:30:21.381
Ah...

520
00:30:21.383 --> 00:30:24.182
There are so many diseases
out here.

521
00:30:24.184 --> 00:30:25.617
It's hot.

522
00:30:25.619 --> 00:30:27.854
Okay, this is
what I'm good at.

523
00:30:27.856 --> 00:30:30.256
Playing video games.
It's what I do.

524
00:30:30.258 --> 00:30:32.525
It's literally
the main thing that I do.

525
00:30:32.527 --> 00:30:34.594
Play a game like this,
there'll be levels.

526
00:30:34.596 --> 00:30:37.397
In order to finish, you gotta
complete all the levels.

527
00:30:37.399 --> 00:30:39.465
Levels are gonna get harder
as we go along.

528
00:30:39.467 --> 00:30:40.934
- We complete the levels...
- Do you

529
00:30:40.936 --> 00:30:42.769
even know
where we're going?

530
00:30:42.771 --> 00:30:44.637
- Kind of.
- Kind of?

531
00:30:44.639 --> 00:30:47.541
Oh, that's good, then.
We're in good hands.

532
00:30:47.543 --> 00:30:50.412
Okay, the missing piece,
I'm guessing.

533
00:30:50.414 --> 00:30:52.279
That must be
what we're looking for,

534
00:30:52.281 --> 00:30:53.548
the missing piece
of the map.

535
00:30:53.550 --> 00:30:55.586
The problem is,
there's nothing here.

536
00:30:57.687 --> 00:31:01.290
What do you mean?
It's a map, just like he said.

537
00:31:01.292 --> 00:31:02.694
It's a map of Jumanji.

538
00:31:03.994 --> 00:31:05.461
Cartography.

539
00:31:05.463 --> 00:31:07.463
- What's that?
- The study of maps.

540
00:31:07.465 --> 00:31:09.598
It was one of
Professor Oberon's skills.

541
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:10.800
Yes. That's right.

542
00:31:10.802 --> 00:31:13.436
Oh, so you can't see this,
but I can?

543
00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:16.005
The characters we chose,
we all have certain skills.

544
00:31:16.007 --> 00:31:18.008
So there's gotta be
a way to access our...

545
00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:21.180
Oh!

546
00:31:22.614 --> 00:31:23.813
Wow.

547
00:31:23.815 --> 00:31:25.315
What'd you just do?

548
00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:27.584
"Strengths:
Fearless. Climbing.

549
00:31:27.586 --> 00:31:29.454
Speed. Boomerang.

550
00:31:29.456 --> 00:31:31.955
Smoldering intensity."

551
00:31:35.328 --> 00:31:37.562
What the hell are you doing?

552
00:31:37.564 --> 00:31:40.669
- What just happened?
- Um, you just smoldered.

553
00:31:41.936 --> 00:31:43.371
"Weakness.

554
00:31:44.705 --> 00:31:45.970
None"?

555
00:31:45.972 --> 00:31:48.707
How'd you do that?
That, uh, list?

556
00:31:48.709 --> 00:31:53.912
Well, I just... I think I just
pressed my enormous left pec.

557
00:31:53.914 --> 00:31:56.350
It's like the boob area.
Let me show you.

558
00:31:56.352 --> 00:31:57.550
Get away from me.

559
00:31:57.552 --> 00:31:59.353
At least press it
in front of us...

560
00:31:59.355 --> 00:32:01.488
...so we know exactly how...

561
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:06.393
"Strengths: Karate. T'ai chi.
Aikido. Dance fighting"?

562
00:32:06.395 --> 00:32:08.763
Dance fighting?
Is that even a thing?

563
00:32:08.765 --> 00:32:10.631
"Weakness:

564
00:32:10.633 --> 00:32:11.899
Venom."

565
00:32:14.605 --> 00:32:16.638
Seriously?

566
00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:20.042
"Paleontology."
What does that even mean?

567
00:32:20.044 --> 00:32:22.777
Study of fossils, I think.

568
00:32:22.779 --> 00:32:25.748
- That's kind of cool.
- Says the gorgeous karate badass

569
00:32:25.750 --> 00:32:28.651
to the old fossil guy
who doesn't have any endurance.

570
00:32:33.090 --> 00:32:34.757
I hate this game.

571
00:32:34.759 --> 00:32:37.026
"Weakness: Cake."

572
00:32:37.028 --> 00:32:40.063
Yes, cake is my weakness.

573
00:32:40.065 --> 00:32:42.766
Along with speed
and strength.

574
00:32:42.768 --> 00:32:43.800
Huh...

575
00:32:43.802 --> 00:32:45.669
Strength is my weakness.

576
00:32:45.671 --> 00:32:48.038
Hey, can I...?
Quick question.

577
00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:49.839
How is strength my weakness?

578
00:32:49.841 --> 00:32:52.976
Somebody explain that to me.
And why would I need speed?

579
00:32:52.978 --> 00:32:55.680
Why would I need to be fast
when I'm being chased

580
00:32:55.682 --> 00:32:59.452
by an enormous killer zebra or
some shit in this dumb-ass hat?

581
00:32:59.454 --> 00:33:01.820
You're also
a good weapons valet.

582
00:33:01.822 --> 00:33:04.990
- What does that mean?
- Well, I think it means

583
00:33:04.992 --> 00:33:06.826
you carry my weapons
in your backpack,

584
00:33:06.828 --> 00:33:10.566
and you give them to me
when and if I need them?

585
00:33:11.733 --> 00:33:15.901
You guys. The map,
it's changing.

586
00:33:15.903 --> 00:33:17.103
What do you mean?

587
00:33:17.105 --> 00:33:18.705
- What's it say?
- Okay, well,

588
00:33:18.707 --> 00:33:20.139
there's not
a lot of information.

589
00:33:20.141 --> 00:33:23.109
But a minute ago, it didn't
say this and now it does.

590
00:33:23.111 --> 00:33:26.581
It says,
"The Mighty Roar."

591
00:33:34.458 --> 00:33:35.956
I don't like that.

592
00:33:35.958 --> 00:33:37.891
- I'm done.
- What else?

593
00:33:37.893 --> 00:33:41.796
Okay. And right here,
it says "From The Deep."

594
00:33:41.798 --> 00:33:44.099
The hippo came from the deep.
The one that...

595
00:33:44.101 --> 00:33:47.570
Yes, the thing that did
the thing. That's it. Moving on.

596
00:33:47.572 --> 00:33:49.773
So if "From The Deep"
is the first level,

597
00:33:49.775 --> 00:33:52.708
then "The Mighty Roar" must be
the second level.

598
00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.744
Which way?

599
00:33:54.746 --> 00:33:56.146
Okay.

600
00:33:56.148 --> 00:33:58.617
If that is that...

601
00:33:59.884 --> 00:34:02.422
and that is here...

602
00:34:03.087 --> 00:34:04.921
Right here, I think.

603
00:34:18.171 --> 00:34:19.706
What is this game?

604
00:34:21.174 --> 00:34:22.743
Run!

605
00:34:25.011 --> 00:34:26.547
Wait!

606
00:34:31.018 --> 00:34:32.887
Ha!

607
00:34:43.966 --> 00:34:45.702
Come on, legs!

608
00:34:48.538 --> 00:34:50.440
Why am I running so slow?

609
00:34:56.078 --> 00:34:57.981
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God!

610
00:35:03.118 --> 00:35:04.954
Aah!
This sucks!

611
00:35:06.157 --> 00:35:07.825
Split up!

612
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.510
Oh, my God.

613
00:35:39.025 --> 00:35:40.761
Aah!

614
00:35:44.098 --> 00:35:45.163
Whoa.

615
00:35:45.165 --> 00:35:47.599
Come on!

616
00:35:47.601 --> 00:35:49.302
- Those guys have huge guns.
- Oh, really?

617
00:35:49.304 --> 00:35:50.869
Is that what
those are, Spencer?

618
00:35:50.871 --> 00:35:52.704
- Let me see your backpack.
- For what?

619
00:35:52.706 --> 00:35:54.907
Inside your backpack,
you have my weapons.

620
00:35:54.909 --> 00:35:56.045
Get down.

621
00:35:58.947 --> 00:36:01.281
Got your weapons?

622
00:36:01.283 --> 00:36:03.783
I can't feel no...
What's this?

623
00:36:03.785 --> 00:36:06.085
Oh, yes. Boomerang,
it's one of my strengths.

624
00:36:06.087 --> 00:36:07.620
What are you gonna do with it?

625
00:36:07.622 --> 00:36:09.156
I don't know.
Kill them, I guess.

626
00:36:09.158 --> 00:36:10.189
Kill them with that?

627
00:36:10.191 --> 00:36:11.293
You got a better idea?

628
00:36:11.295 --> 00:36:12.895
Oh, watch yourself.

629
00:36:14.229 --> 00:36:15.229
Watch this.

630
00:36:19.335 --> 00:36:21.603
- Nice work.
- There!

631
00:36:21.605 --> 00:36:23.339
Want me to see
if I got a hacky sack

632
00:36:23.341 --> 00:36:25.611
for you to throw
and do nothing with?

633
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:39.355
Oh!

634
00:36:39.357 --> 00:36:42.059
- Wait, wait.
- Oh, no.

635
00:36:47.065 --> 00:36:48.668
It worked.

636
00:36:50.269 --> 00:36:51.903
Here they come. We gotta go.

637
00:36:51.905 --> 00:36:53.673
I can't outrun those guys.

638
00:36:55.374 --> 00:36:56.807
We gotta go now!

639
00:36:56.809 --> 00:36:58.843
- Get on my back.
- I would rather die.

640
00:36:58.845 --> 00:37:00.378
- Jump on my back!
- Nope. I'll die.

641
00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:02.113
Put me down!

642
00:37:02.115 --> 00:37:04.853
Spencer! Put me down!

643
00:37:14.262 --> 00:37:16.963
Whew!

644
00:37:16.965 --> 00:37:19.635
You have got
to be kidding me.

645
00:37:20.702 --> 00:37:23.072
Oh, no, no, no!

646
00:37:27.075 --> 00:37:29.109
- We have to jump!
- Are you out of your mind?

647
00:37:29.111 --> 00:37:31.411
I would rather do
anything else now but that.

648
00:37:31.413 --> 00:37:33.414
Jump!

649
00:37:33.416 --> 00:37:35.316
- Martha!
- Jump!

650
00:37:35.318 --> 00:37:38.854
We gotta jump!

651
00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:40.988
We don't know
how deep that water is.

652
00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:42.858
- We gotta go!
- No, no!

653
00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:46.731
- You gonna jump. Jump!
- No!

654
00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:07.016
Oh! I think
I'm having a coronary.

655
00:38:07.018 --> 00:38:08.751
I'm having difficulty
breathing.

656
00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:11.455
That was the most
humiliating moment of my life.

657
00:38:11.457 --> 00:38:13.457
Don't you do that again.

658
00:38:13.459 --> 00:38:15.292
I took in a lot of water.

659
00:38:20.268 --> 00:38:22.133
They got me.

660
00:38:22.135 --> 00:38:23.903
Oh, no.

661
00:38:25.037 --> 00:38:26.641
Martha?

662
00:38:31.011 --> 00:38:36.050
- Wait, what just happened to her?
- Is she dead? Did she die?

663
00:38:38.486 --> 00:38:40.921
Wait a second.

664
00:38:40.923 --> 00:38:43.156
What the hell is hap...?

665
00:38:43.158 --> 00:38:44.324
Ow!

666
00:38:44.326 --> 00:38:46.193
- Get off of my back!
- Are you okay?

667
00:38:46.195 --> 00:38:48.261
- I think so.
- Off of me!

668
00:38:48.263 --> 00:38:50.930
- Goodness gracious, get off!
- I'm getting off of you.

669
00:38:50.932 --> 00:38:52.165
Anybody care if I'm okay?

670
00:38:52.167 --> 00:38:54.203
What am I,
a human landing pad?

671
00:38:57.172 --> 00:38:58.474
That's what I thought.

672
00:38:58.476 --> 00:39:00.074
We each have
three lives, guys.

673
00:39:00.076 --> 00:39:02.976
These little tattoos
on our arms...

674
00:39:02.978 --> 00:39:05.513
Jesus, would you look
at the size of that thing?

675
00:39:05.515 --> 00:39:07.283
- Spencer!
- What?

676
00:39:07.285 --> 00:39:10.753
- You were saying?
- It's our life count.

677
00:39:10.755 --> 00:39:14.055
Bethany got eaten by a hippo,
so now she only has two lines.

678
00:39:14.057 --> 00:39:15.324
He's right.

679
00:39:15.326 --> 00:39:18.830
Wait. What happens
if we use up all our lives?

680
00:39:20.098 --> 00:39:22.701
Well, usually
that would mean...

681
00:39:24.136 --> 00:39:25.468
...game over.

682
00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:27.203
What do you mean,
"game over"?

683
00:39:27.205 --> 00:39:29.974
Are you saying that
we can actually die in here?

684
00:39:29.976 --> 00:39:31.842
I mean, I don't know
for sure, but...

685
00:39:31.844 --> 00:39:33.344
You're not sure?
You're not sure,

686
00:39:33.346 --> 00:39:36.281
- Mr. Video-Game-Genius?
- I've never been stuck in one!

687
00:39:36.283 --> 00:39:41.553
So I'm not certain, but, yes,
I'm afraid we all could die.

688
00:39:43.524 --> 00:39:46.060
That is my big concern
right now.

689
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:52.565
We better find
the missing piece, then.

690
00:39:52.567 --> 00:39:54.737
Okay.

691
00:39:57.137 --> 00:39:58.838
It looks like
there's a village

692
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:00.540
on the other side
of this mountain.

693
00:40:00.542 --> 00:40:02.576
Maybe that's the bazaar.

694
00:40:02.578 --> 00:40:05.048
- Let's do it.
- Wait.

695
00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:08.114
I gotta take a leak first.

696
00:40:08.116 --> 00:40:11.286
I've been
dreading this all day,

697
00:40:11.288 --> 00:40:13.886
but so do I.

698
00:40:13.888 --> 00:40:17.027
Can I come with you
and you show me how it's done?

699
00:40:17.994 --> 00:40:20.394
I may need your help.

700
00:40:20.396 --> 00:40:26.201
Uh, yeah, sure.
Yeah, I'm... I'll help you out.

701
00:40:28.539 --> 00:40:30.539
So how do we do this?

702
00:40:30.541 --> 00:40:32.473
Uh. Easy.
You just, uh...

703
00:40:32.475 --> 00:40:34.910
You unzip, take it out,
fire away.

704
00:40:34.912 --> 00:40:38.885
Remember to aim.
It's very important.

705
00:40:41.218 --> 00:40:43.485
My God, you guys,
there is literally a penis

706
00:40:43.487 --> 00:40:44.987
attached to my body
right now.

707
00:40:44.989 --> 00:40:46.590
Martha,
come look at my penis!

708
00:40:46.592 --> 00:40:48.392
No, thanks.

709
00:40:48.394 --> 00:40:51.228
- This the first you've seen it?
- Yes. I didn't wanna look.

710
00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.930
I looked at mine
the first 20 seconds here.

711
00:40:53.932 --> 00:40:55.399
I'm happy to report
that I was able

712
00:40:55.401 --> 00:40:57.937
to bring one thing
from the outside world.

713
00:40:59.004 --> 00:41:00.605
Are you...? What are you doing?

714
00:41:00.607 --> 00:41:01.972
- Are you looking?
- Sorry.

715
00:41:01.974 --> 00:41:03.240
You don't look over!

716
00:41:03.242 --> 00:41:05.476
Yeah, you never look.
It's a thing.

717
00:41:05.478 --> 00:41:07.378
Okay, good boy.

718
00:41:07.380 --> 00:41:09.381
We're gonna take this
nice and slow,

719
00:41:09.383 --> 00:41:10.648
and nobody's gonna get hurt.

720
00:41:10.650 --> 00:41:12.452
- Now what?
- Now blast off.

721
00:41:12.454 --> 00:41:13.951
And aim.
Don't forget to aim.

722
00:41:13.953 --> 00:41:16.054
What is with you and aiming?
What happened?

723
00:41:16.056 --> 00:41:17.657
Can we not talk about this?

724
00:41:17.659 --> 00:41:20.559
Wow, wow, wow!

725
00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:22.961
Oh, this is
so much easier!

726
00:41:22.963 --> 00:41:24.464
It's cool, right?

727
00:41:24.466 --> 00:41:27.099
Yeah, because you have,
like, a handle.

728
00:41:27.101 --> 00:41:29.569
The fact that I'm not
Instagramming this

729
00:41:29.571 --> 00:41:31.273
right now is insane.

730
00:41:34.143 --> 00:41:36.243
- This looks all right.
- Up ahead!

731
00:41:56.667 --> 00:41:58.134
Bravestone.

732
00:41:58.136 --> 00:42:00.205
Him and that whole lot.

733
00:42:01.472 --> 00:42:02.909
They got away?

734
00:42:03.675 --> 00:42:05.277
We lost them in the jungle.

735
00:42:06.145 --> 00:42:08.047
I should have known.

736
00:42:10.483 --> 00:42:13.050
H-how do you mean, sir?

737
00:42:13.052 --> 00:42:16.321
I will summon every creature
and every soldier

738
00:42:16.323 --> 00:42:18.388
to hunt them down.

739
00:42:18.390 --> 00:42:21.127
Reclaim what is mine.

740
00:42:24.465 --> 00:42:25.900
Find them.

741
00:42:29.536 --> 00:42:31.469
Be careful
of the ground, guys.

742
00:42:31.471 --> 00:42:34.206
It's uneven. I'd hate
for anybody to twist an ankle.

743
00:42:34.208 --> 00:42:36.376
- I did that once...
- Please stop talking?

744
00:42:36.378 --> 00:42:38.978
- Okay, sure. No problem.
- Please!

745
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:40.680
- Can I borrow your jacket?
- Yeah, sure.

746
00:42:40.682 --> 00:42:42.182
- Thanks.
- What are you doing?

747
00:42:42.184 --> 00:42:44.450
I feel like I'm wearing
a bikini at school.

748
00:42:44.452 --> 00:42:46.720
I did that once.
They sent me to the office.

749
00:42:46.722 --> 00:42:48.153
Of course.

750
00:42:48.155 --> 00:42:50.022
Noah likes it
when I show some skin.

751
00:42:50.024 --> 00:42:51.726
It's like the key
to our relationship.

752
00:42:51.728 --> 00:42:53.460
Ew.

753
00:42:53.462 --> 00:42:57.332
Judgy much? Seriously, I can't
even open my mouth around you.

754
00:42:57.334 --> 00:43:00.736
You don't even know me, but you,
like, decided you hate me.

755
00:43:00.738 --> 00:43:03.240
Oh, wait a minute.
I don't hate you.

756
00:43:05.041 --> 00:43:07.309
- You don't?
- No.

757
00:43:07.311 --> 00:43:09.611
Look, I just think
you live in, like,

758
00:43:09.613 --> 00:43:11.079
the "hot popular girl"
bubble.

759
00:43:11.081 --> 00:43:12.647
Where everybody
either treats you

760
00:43:12.649 --> 00:43:14.717
like a princess
or like an object.

761
00:43:14.719 --> 00:43:19.959
Maybe it makes you a little...
self-absorbed or something?

762
00:43:23.127 --> 00:43:25.027
That's fair.

763
00:43:25.029 --> 00:43:27.129
But do you think maybe
the reason why you're

764
00:43:27.131 --> 00:43:29.633
so judgy is because
you're, like, afraid that

765
00:43:29.635 --> 00:43:31.101
people aren't gonna
like you,

766
00:43:31.103 --> 00:43:33.169
so you decide
not to like them first?

767
00:43:33.171 --> 00:43:35.208
No.

768
00:43:36.041 --> 00:43:39.078
Maybe. Maybe.

769
00:43:40.045 --> 00:43:42.246
Okay, then.

770
00:43:42.249 --> 00:43:45.118
I'm just saying,
you're a babe. Own it.

771
00:43:47.288 --> 00:43:48.752
Thanks.

772
00:43:48.754 --> 00:43:50.722
I guess.

773
00:43:57.466 --> 00:44:00.533
So sick of this game.
Just stay out of my way, Spencer.

774
00:44:00.535 --> 00:44:02.368
What are you mad at me for?

775
00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.504
Why? Are you
seriously asking me that?

776
00:44:04.506 --> 00:44:06.305
You got me
kicked off the team.

777
00:44:06.307 --> 00:44:09.542
Then you got me stuck in
whatever... Whatever this is.

778
00:44:09.544 --> 00:44:11.579
And you wonder
why we not friends no more.

779
00:44:11.581 --> 00:44:13.514
This is why
we're not friends anymore?

780
00:44:13.516 --> 00:44:16.349
You didn't wanna get stuck
in Jumanji? I don't think so.

781
00:44:16.351 --> 00:44:18.485
We're not friends
because I'm not cool enough

782
00:44:18.487 --> 00:44:20.420
to hang out with you,
so you pretended

783
00:44:20.422 --> 00:44:22.657
not to even know me anymore,
until you needed me

784
00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:25.327
to do your homework because
you couldn't do it yourself.

785
00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:26.861
No wonder
you don't know anything

786
00:44:26.863 --> 00:44:28.263
about westward expansion.

787
00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:30.631
Okay, you see that?
You know what?

788
00:44:30.633 --> 00:44:32.234
I'm not stupid,
Spencer.

789
00:44:32.236 --> 00:44:34.304
I asked you to do me
one simple favor.

790
00:44:34.306 --> 00:44:35.671
Do my homework, so I don't

791
00:44:35.673 --> 00:44:38.273
get kicked off the team,
and you messed that up.

792
00:44:38.275 --> 00:44:40.576
Now I can't do the one thing
that I'm good at,

793
00:44:40.578 --> 00:44:42.846
and it's all your fault.

794
00:44:42.848 --> 00:44:45.285
I should kick
the shit out you right now.

795
00:44:53.526 --> 00:44:54.658
I'd like to see you try.

796
00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:56.063
What did you say?

797
00:44:57.863 --> 00:45:00.331
Oh, okay.

798
00:45:00.333 --> 00:45:01.865
I see what's going on here.

799
00:45:01.867 --> 00:45:03.502
Guys.

800
00:45:03.504 --> 00:45:05.871
You think because you...
You, what, 6'4 ", 6'5",

801
00:45:05.873 --> 00:45:07.404
270 pounds of pure muscle,

802
00:45:07.406 --> 00:45:09.174
I'm supposed
to be afraid of you?

803
00:45:09.176 --> 00:45:10.546
Is that what you think?

804
00:45:11.844 --> 00:45:13.214
Maybe.

805
00:45:17.385 --> 00:45:19.352
Let me tell you something.

806
00:45:19.354 --> 00:45:21.153
You're still
the same annoying kid

807
00:45:21.155 --> 00:45:23.492
I've been trying to shake
since seventh grade.

808
00:45:24.593 --> 00:45:26.292
Ain't nothing changed.

809
00:45:26.294 --> 00:45:29.495
Don't let this new body
get your butt whupped.

810
00:45:34.803 --> 00:45:36.273
Dumb-ass.

811
00:45:42.445 --> 00:45:43.878
- No!
- Spencer!

812
00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.713
Spencer!

813
00:45:45.715 --> 00:45:48.317
- You killed him!
- Fridge, you lunatic!

814
00:45:48.319 --> 00:45:50.489
Chill out. He'll be back.

815
00:46:08.341 --> 00:46:10.175
Don't call me a dumb-ass.

816
00:46:10.942 --> 00:46:13.242
Don't push me.

817
00:46:13.244 --> 00:46:14.644
Or what, Spencer?

818
00:46:14.646 --> 00:46:16.516
Or I'll push you back.

819
00:46:24.923 --> 00:46:26.426
- Oh!
- Oh!

820
00:46:28.996 --> 00:46:30.532
Did you just smack me?

821
00:46:31.898 --> 00:46:33.599
You gonna smack me?

822
00:46:33.601 --> 00:46:37.002
- Fridge, no.
- Yeah, yeah.

823
00:46:37.004 --> 00:46:38.738
Huh? You wanna smack...?

824
00:46:39.773 --> 00:46:41.442
Oh, no, no, no!

825
00:46:42.611 --> 00:46:43.611
Enough.

826
00:46:44.845 --> 00:46:46.549
We can't waste lives.

827
00:46:47.449 --> 00:46:49.250
We need each other.

828
00:46:49.252 --> 00:46:53.786
Like it or not,
we have to do this together.

829
00:46:56.993 --> 00:46:58.826
Could you say that
one more time, please?

830
00:46:58.828 --> 00:47:01.662
- We have to do this together?
- But with the smolder.

831
00:47:01.664 --> 00:47:05.532
Do you have control of that,
or does that happen naturally?

832
00:47:05.534 --> 00:47:07.535
It just happens naturally.

833
00:47:36.602 --> 00:47:38.368
What are we supposed
to be doing?

834
00:47:38.370 --> 00:47:39.937
Looking for
the missing map piece.

835
00:47:39.939 --> 00:47:41.638
So we just start
asking for it?

836
00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.309
No, I think we look around,
scope the place out,

837
00:47:44.311 --> 00:47:46.378
but most importantly, guys,

838
00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.282
be discreet.

839
00:47:49.049 --> 00:47:51.784
Rations! Get your rations!

840
00:47:51.786 --> 00:47:54.485
Does anyone have any money?
I'm literally starving.

841
00:47:54.487 --> 00:47:57.623
Rations! Get your rations!

842
00:47:57.625 --> 00:47:59.757
Rations!

843
00:47:59.759 --> 00:48:02.027
Guys, I think the game
is trying to tell us

844
00:48:02.029 --> 00:48:03.094
to keep our health up.

845
00:48:03.096 --> 00:48:05.064
We need to eat.

846
00:48:05.066 --> 00:48:06.799
Okay, stop doing that.

847
00:48:06.801 --> 00:48:08.401
Oh, my God, this is so good.

848
00:48:08.403 --> 00:48:10.404
I haven't had bread
since I was, like, 9.

849
00:48:10.406 --> 00:48:11.538
Are you serious?

850
00:48:11.540 --> 00:48:13.641
How do you think
I got these abs?

851
00:48:13.643 --> 00:48:15.579
Let me try some of that.

852
00:48:16.578 --> 00:48:18.281
Mm.

853
00:48:19.514 --> 00:48:21.849
Wait, what...?
What is this?

854
00:48:21.851 --> 00:48:23.117
That's my famous pound cake.

855
00:48:24.119 --> 00:48:26.354
Cake?

856
00:48:26.356 --> 00:48:27.823
Bethany, you said
this was bread.

857
00:48:27.825 --> 00:48:30.425
It's been so long,
I forgot what it tastes like.

858
00:48:30.427 --> 00:48:31.892
How do you forget what...?

859
00:48:31.894 --> 00:48:34.095
What's hap...
Something happening to me?

860
00:48:34.097 --> 00:48:35.630
- No.
- Am I... Am I shaking?

861
00:48:35.632 --> 00:48:37.098
- Huh-uh.
- Am I breaking out?

862
00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.966
No.

863
00:48:38.968 --> 00:48:41.135
- Am I still black?
- Yes.

864
00:48:41.137 --> 00:48:44.840
Okay. Okay, right?

865
00:48:44.842 --> 00:48:47.009
We're fine.
Everything is fine.

866
00:48:47.011 --> 00:48:48.512
Yeah, no, no, no,
it's okay.

867
00:48:48.514 --> 00:48:50.481
It probably just meant
that I love cake.

868
00:48:50.483 --> 00:48:52.448
That I couldn't resist it.
Yeah.

869
00:48:52.450 --> 00:48:54.550
Hey, it's all good...

870
00:49:07.968 --> 00:49:09.134
God!

871
00:49:09.136 --> 00:49:12.036
Oh! Ow!

872
00:49:12.038 --> 00:49:13.809
What the hell? Ugh!

873
00:49:15.107 --> 00:49:17.041
Like I said,
important to be discreet.

874
00:49:17.043 --> 00:49:18.510
Hey, you also said eat.

875
00:49:18.512 --> 00:49:20.146
Rations!
Get your...

876
00:49:20.148 --> 00:49:21.783
You better
shut your ass up!

877
00:49:23.484 --> 00:49:25.885
Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here.

878
00:49:25.887 --> 00:49:27.086
Jumanji needs you.

879
00:49:27.088 --> 00:49:30.823
Uh. Thanks. Good to be here.

880
00:49:30.825 --> 00:49:32.491
Ask about
the missing piece.

881
00:49:32.493 --> 00:49:34.627
Oh, right.
Hi. I'm Bethany.

882
00:49:34.629 --> 00:49:37.798
I mean...
Professor Shelly, something.

883
00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.198
I'm a map doctor,

884
00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:42.769
and I have this map that,
like, has a missing piece.

885
00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:45.139
Dr. Bravestone.
Thank goodness you're here.

886
00:49:45.141 --> 00:49:46.475
Jumanji needs you.

887
00:49:46.477 --> 00:49:47.742
Rude.

888
00:49:47.744 --> 00:49:50.515
We need to find
the missing piece.

889
00:50:24.050 --> 00:50:27.686
<i>What you need
is in the basket</i>

890
00:50:27.688 --> 00:50:30.489
<i>One false move,
you're in a casket</i>

891
00:50:30.491 --> 00:50:33.824
<i>Trust one another,
and never blink</i>

892
00:50:33.826 --> 00:50:37.666
<i>The missing piece
is not what you think</i>

893
00:50:38.800 --> 00:50:40.031
Oy vey.

894
00:50:40.033 --> 00:50:41.934
Good luck, mighty hero.

895
00:50:41.936 --> 00:50:44.236
- Jumanji needs you.
- Jumanji needs him. We know.

896
00:50:44.238 --> 00:50:46.442
You said it several times.

897
00:50:51.846 --> 00:50:55.815
So thinking there's a, um...

898
00:50:55.817 --> 00:50:58.285
A snake in there
or something?

899
00:50:58.287 --> 00:50:59.719
Yep.

900
00:50:59.721 --> 00:51:01.622
Sounds like
a Bravestone thing to me.

901
00:51:01.624 --> 00:51:03.525
Why would this be
a Bravestone thing?

902
00:51:03.527 --> 00:51:05.293
You're the hero.
You heard what he said.

903
00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:06.896
"Jumanji needs you."
Now, get.

904
00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.548
I don't wanna do this!

905
00:51:24.550 --> 00:51:25.715
Just go.

906
00:51:47.106 --> 00:51:48.606
Black mamba!

907
00:51:48.608 --> 00:51:50.576
That's a black mamba.

908
00:51:50.578 --> 00:51:53.109
A quarter milligram of its venom
is enough to kill an adult.

909
00:51:53.111 --> 00:51:55.313
You'll feel a tingling
in your mouth and extremities,

910
00:51:55.315 --> 00:51:57.849
followed by a fever, foaming
at the mouth, and ataxia,

911
00:51:57.851 --> 00:51:59.618
which means
loss of muscle control.

912
00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.186
- How do I know that?
- What do we do?

913
00:52:01.188 --> 00:52:03.656
- See anything else in there?
- I didn't have time.

914
00:52:03.658 --> 00:52:05.057
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

915
00:52:05.059 --> 00:52:07.760
"Trust one another
and never blink." Never blink.

916
00:52:07.762 --> 00:52:10.830
You guys, I think
it's a staring contest.

917
00:52:10.832 --> 00:52:12.333
- What?
- What are you talking about?

918
00:52:12.335 --> 00:52:15.268
- Think about it. "Never blink"?
- Guys, I think she's right.

919
00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:16.936
At camp,
they used to tell us

920
00:52:16.938 --> 00:52:19.239
if you see a rattlesnake,
don't move. I think someone

921
00:52:19.241 --> 00:52:21.942
has to make direct eye contact
and not blink.

922
00:52:21.944 --> 00:52:23.877
And then Spencer
will reach in and grab

923
00:52:23.879 --> 00:52:26.347
- whatever else is in there.
- What? Why me again?

924
00:52:26.349 --> 00:52:28.682
- Because you're Bravestone.
- Okay, fine.

925
00:52:28.684 --> 00:52:32.055
Who's good at staring
and not blinking?

926
00:52:33.990 --> 00:52:35.257
I'm amazing at it.

927
00:52:35.259 --> 00:52:37.225
Then this is your moment.

928
00:52:40.364 --> 00:52:42.700
Come on, Bethany.

929
00:52:47.237 --> 00:52:48.574
Okay.

930
00:52:51.976 --> 00:52:53.111
Just say when.

931
00:52:55.981 --> 00:52:57.083
Now.

932
00:53:05.325 --> 00:53:07.324
Oh!

933
00:53:07.326 --> 00:53:09.596
What do we do?

934
00:53:12.298 --> 00:53:13.365
You gotta defang it.

935
00:53:13.367 --> 00:53:16.001
I gotta what?

936
00:53:16.003 --> 00:53:17.702
You gotta pull
his mouth back

937
00:53:17.704 --> 00:53:19.671
from the blind spot
to disorient it.

938
00:53:19.673 --> 00:53:21.673
But be very careful
of the venom gland

939
00:53:21.675 --> 00:53:23.775
and the exposed
secondary venom duct.

940
00:53:23.777 --> 00:53:25.310
Then you gotta
snap its teeth...

941
00:53:27.883 --> 00:53:29.381
...out of its head.

942
00:53:29.383 --> 00:53:32.020
Oh, oh!

943
00:53:34.156 --> 00:53:36.890
I guess it wasn't
a staring contest.

944
00:53:36.892 --> 00:53:40.160
"Trust each other
and never blink."

945
00:53:40.162 --> 00:53:42.227
You trusted me.

946
00:53:42.229 --> 00:53:44.431
You trusted me,
and I defanged the snake.

947
00:53:44.433 --> 00:53:46.368
I did it.
I did that.

948
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:49.003
Yeah.
Yeah, you did it.

949
00:53:49.005 --> 00:53:50.439
Thank you.

950
00:53:50.441 --> 00:53:53.044
Oh, yeah. Sure.

951
00:54:03.353 --> 00:54:04.987
You guys?

952
00:54:04.989 --> 00:54:07.456
This does not look like
a piece of a map.

953
00:54:07.458 --> 00:54:10.893
The missing piece
is an elephant?

954
00:54:10.895 --> 00:54:13.862
Oh, wait, there's something
written on the wrapping paper.

955
00:54:13.864 --> 00:54:17.166
"When you see me,
begin the climb."

956
00:54:17.168 --> 00:54:21.074
"Begin the climb"?
When you see an elephant?

957
00:54:23.209 --> 00:54:25.075
I defanged a snake.

958
00:54:26.879 --> 00:54:30.014
So keep your eyes
peeled for an elephant, I guess?

959
00:54:30.016 --> 00:54:32.283
That's, like,
the next level of the game?

960
00:54:38.526 --> 00:54:39.959
Hey!

961
00:54:39.961 --> 00:54:41.263
Run!

962
00:54:45.532 --> 00:54:47.832
Oh, God.

963
00:54:47.834 --> 00:54:49.871
Watch out!

964
00:54:52.206 --> 00:54:53.306
Jump!

965
00:54:53.308 --> 00:54:55.111
- Jump.
- Go, go, go!

966
00:54:55.977 --> 00:54:57.145
Hey!

967
00:55:03.385 --> 00:55:08.188
I have to warn you, I think
I'm a very strong puncher.

968
00:55:08.190 --> 00:55:09.259
Parry.

969
00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:13.093
Parry. Parry. Evade. Block.

970
00:55:13.095 --> 00:55:14.395
Uppercut.

971
00:55:17.233 --> 00:55:19.304
Oh. Oh.

972
00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:22.136
Duck! Head smash!

973
00:55:24.376 --> 00:55:25.376
Kerpow!

974
00:55:28.178 --> 00:55:30.245
Duck! Block!

975
00:55:30.247 --> 00:55:31.751
Ka-blam!

976
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:35.818
Evade! Punch!

977
00:55:35.820 --> 00:55:38.455
Wall toss!

978
00:55:38.457 --> 00:55:40.861
That is insane.

979
00:55:48.368 --> 00:55:51.134
Let's do this.

980
00:55:51.136 --> 00:55:52.136
Do what?

981
00:55:53.507 --> 00:55:56.210
Put... Put it
in my backpack.

982
00:55:57.244 --> 00:55:59.945
Dodge! Head slam!

983
00:55:59.947 --> 00:56:01.179
Throw through ceiling!

984
00:56:10.124 --> 00:56:11.225
- Ah! - Ah!
- Ah!

985
00:56:26.476 --> 00:56:28.943
Hello, doctor.

986
00:56:28.945 --> 00:56:31.048
Been a long time.

987
00:56:33.582 --> 00:56:37.355
I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

988
00:56:38.556 --> 00:56:40.255
We just wanna go home.

989
00:56:45.363 --> 00:56:47.597
Come on! Come with me! Hurry!

990
00:56:47.599 --> 00:56:48.964
Get him!

991
00:56:56.441 --> 00:56:57.910
Come on.

992
00:57:01.979 --> 00:57:04.884
Down here.
Come on. Quick!

993
00:57:20.668 --> 00:57:22.133
Shh!

994
00:57:22.135 --> 00:57:23.502
Okay.

995
00:57:23.504 --> 00:57:26.506
I need you to follow me
and do exactly as I say.

996
00:57:26.508 --> 00:57:29.375
Let's move.

997
00:57:29.377 --> 00:57:32.111
Oh, my God, you guys,
I am so stoked you are here.

998
00:57:32.113 --> 00:57:34.447
- You have no idea. So stoked.
- You are?

999
00:57:34.449 --> 00:57:36.449
I mean, I saw you
guys in the bazaar,

1000
00:57:36.451 --> 00:57:38.284
and I thought
to myself, "No way."

1001
00:57:38.286 --> 00:57:40.085
Then I was like,
yeah, that's...

1002
00:57:40.087 --> 00:57:42.025
Backs against the wall!

1003
00:57:43.558 --> 00:57:45.027
Oh, my goodness!

1004
00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:49.165
Let's keep moving.

1005
00:57:50.334 --> 00:57:52.700
- Watch your step in here.
- Um, who are you?

1006
00:57:52.702 --> 00:57:54.169
And who do you think
we are?

1007
00:57:54.171 --> 00:57:56.171
Right.
Sorry, okay, my bad.

1008
00:57:56.173 --> 00:57:58.238
Um. Let me back up
a little bit here.

1009
00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:00.409
Wait, are you the pilot?
"Seaplane" somebody?

1010
00:58:00.411 --> 00:58:02.344
- Yeah, that's me.
- Wait a minute.

1011
00:58:02.346 --> 00:58:04.413
You're the other
character that was taken.

1012
00:58:04.415 --> 00:58:07.583
- So you're in the game too?
- Stay off the white bricks...

1013
00:58:07.585 --> 00:58:09.050
- What?
- And freeze.

1014
00:58:09.052 --> 00:58:10.719
- Aah!
- Oh!

1015
00:58:16.394 --> 00:58:18.729
So gnarly.

1016
00:58:18.731 --> 00:58:21.335
This game sucks.

1017
00:58:23.435 --> 00:58:25.037
Hup!

1018
00:58:30.209 --> 00:58:33.213
All right. Get this plank.

1019
00:58:37.584 --> 00:58:40.118
Follow me.

1020
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:42.653
Careful.
It's a horrible way to die.

1021
00:58:42.655 --> 00:58:44.959
Oh, God.

1022
00:58:46.527 --> 00:58:48.128
There you go. All right.

1023
00:58:55.037 --> 00:58:56.404
Come on.

1024
00:58:57.805 --> 00:59:00.340
I got it, I got it.
I just defanged a snake.

1025
00:59:00.342 --> 00:59:02.278
Give me
a little respect.

1026
00:59:07.382 --> 00:59:09.384
Okay.

1027
00:59:18.226 --> 00:59:20.999
- Hi there.
- Hi.

1028
00:59:27.136 --> 00:59:28.574
Come on.

1029
00:59:41.252 --> 00:59:44.153
Anyway, I'm Alex.

1030
00:59:44.155 --> 00:59:46.223
Spencer Gilpin.

1031
00:59:46.225 --> 00:59:49.326
Martha, Fridge and Bethany.

1032
00:59:49.328 --> 00:59:51.695
Bethany? You're a girl?

1033
00:59:51.697 --> 00:59:54.264
Woman.

1034
00:59:54.266 --> 00:59:56.503
In real life, you'd probably
wanna hit that.

1035
01:00:03.311 --> 01:00:06.048
They got away.
Looks like they had help.

1036
01:00:07.381 --> 01:00:08.814
Seaplane.

1037
01:00:08.816 --> 01:00:11.086
He must've crawled out
of his hole.

1038
01:00:12.254 --> 01:00:14.587
I'm sorry, boss.

1039
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:16.525
It won't happen again.

1040
01:00:19.495 --> 01:00:21.728
I know it won't.

1041
01:00:35.845 --> 01:00:37.379
What are you making?

1042
01:00:37.381 --> 01:00:39.547
Margaritas. It's actually
one of my strengths.

1043
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:42.283
That and piloting,
although I did get shot down

1044
01:00:42.285 --> 01:00:44.520
by a couple orangutans
in fighter jets,

1045
01:00:44.522 --> 01:00:46.658
so maybe not
that great at it.

1046
01:00:47.757 --> 01:00:49.691
Anyway, cheers.

1047
01:00:49.693 --> 01:00:51.461
Ah.

1048
01:00:51.463 --> 01:00:54.197
- Oh. Thanks.
- Sure.

1049
01:00:54.199 --> 01:00:55.697
I've never
had alcohol before.

1050
01:00:55.699 --> 01:00:57.767
- Me either.
- Know what?

1051
01:00:57.769 --> 01:01:00.139
- What the hell? Woo!
- Lehayim.

1052
01:01:06.244 --> 01:01:09.380
- And I'm done with that.
- It's good.

1053
01:01:09.382 --> 01:01:10.814
Can I get one more of those?

1054
01:01:10.816 --> 01:01:12.183
- Yeah.
- Alex?

1055
01:01:12.185 --> 01:01:13.585
What's up with
all these candles?

1056
01:01:13.587 --> 01:01:15.487
ALEX? Citronella. One
of my weaknesses

1057
01:01:15.489 --> 01:01:18.322
is mosquitoes,
which is kind of a bummer

1058
01:01:18.324 --> 01:01:20.758
when you live alone
in an open hut in the jungle.

1059
01:01:21.929 --> 01:01:23.365
He's single.

1060
01:01:24.298 --> 01:01:25.631
Who's this?

1061
01:01:25.633 --> 01:01:28.233
Who's Alan Parrish?

1062
01:01:28.235 --> 01:01:29.669
He's the guy
who built this place.

1063
01:01:29.671 --> 01:01:32.638
Wait, other people have
been stuck here too?

1064
01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:35.541
Yeah. This is Alan Parrish's
house. I'm just living in it.

1065
01:01:35.543 --> 01:01:37.677
So, Alex, tell me,

1066
01:01:37.679 --> 01:01:40.346
how long have
you been in the game?

1067
01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:41.847
Oh, it's tough to say.

1068
01:01:41.849 --> 01:01:43.951
Time is kind of funny here.

1069
01:01:43.953 --> 01:01:45.419
But a few months, at least.

1070
01:01:45.421 --> 01:01:46.820
- A few months?
- What?

1071
01:01:46.822 --> 01:01:48.323
Yeah,
I can't seem to make it

1072
01:01:48.325 --> 01:01:49.823
past the transportation shed.

1073
01:01:49.825 --> 01:01:51.792
Transportation shed?
What's that?

1074
01:01:51.794 --> 01:01:53.528
It's the next level.

1075
01:01:53.530 --> 01:01:56.297
First time, my hot-air balloon
wouldn't even take off.

1076
01:01:56.299 --> 01:01:59.202
And then there was the whole
plane thing I mentioned.

1077
01:02:00.304 --> 01:02:03.938
And once I got down
to my last life,

1078
01:02:03.940 --> 01:02:05.808
I realized I was screwed.

1079
01:02:05.810 --> 01:02:08.643
And that I was never gonna
get out of here by myself.

1080
01:02:08.645 --> 01:02:11.615
Half the stuff that came at me,
I had zero way to deal with.

1081
01:02:11.617 --> 01:02:13.783
You can't kill a black mamba
with a margarita.

1082
01:02:13.785 --> 01:02:17.687
You sure can't.
You need a zoologist for that.

1083
01:02:19.458 --> 01:02:21.890
Alex, we can help each other.

1084
01:02:21.892 --> 01:02:24.495
You've been here a long time,
you know the game,

1085
01:02:24.497 --> 01:02:26.596
and between us,
we have a lot of strengths.

1086
01:02:26.598 --> 01:02:29.602
Yeah. We're actually
pretty good together.

1087
01:02:30.469 --> 01:02:32.336
I don't know, bro.

1088
01:02:32.338 --> 01:02:35.640
Okay, I mess up
one more time, I'm toast.

1089
01:02:35.642 --> 01:02:37.675
Totally freaks me out
even thinking about

1090
01:02:37.677 --> 01:02:39.713
going back to
the transportation shed.

1091
01:02:41.682 --> 01:02:43.514
I don't wanna die
in Jumanji.

1092
01:02:43.516 --> 01:02:45.417
We just gotta stick together.

1093
01:02:45.419 --> 01:02:47.522
If we do that, we can win.
I know we can.

1094
01:02:50.357 --> 01:02:52.792
Oh, my God.
You're our missing piece.

1095
01:02:52.794 --> 01:02:54.861
You were the thing
we needed to find.

1096
01:02:54.863 --> 01:02:57.363
So the clue was to, what,

1097
01:02:57.365 --> 01:02:59.799
go to the bazaar
to find the missing piece?

1098
01:02:59.801 --> 01:03:01.637
It wasn't the elephant.

1099
01:03:03.505 --> 01:03:05.774
- It was me.
- Yeah.

1100
01:03:08.777 --> 01:03:11.479
Dudes, let's do this.

1101
01:03:11.481 --> 01:03:12.780
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1102
01:03:12.782 --> 01:03:15.317
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

1103
01:03:15.319 --> 01:03:17.451
Hey, Spencer,
you gonna drink that margarita?

1104
01:03:17.453 --> 01:03:18.653
I... You're done.

1105
01:03:18.655 --> 01:03:20.921
This is one good margarita.

1106
01:03:28.799 --> 01:03:31.766
There it is. The
transportation shed.

1107
01:03:31.768 --> 01:03:33.869
There's all sorts
of vehicles inside.

1108
01:03:33.871 --> 01:03:36.072
We gotta get one,
get across the canyon,

1109
01:03:36.074 --> 01:03:38.809
and get to the Jaguar statue.

1110
01:03:38.811 --> 01:03:40.843
Okay, I see
the transportation shed,

1111
01:03:40.845 --> 01:03:43.513
I see the canyon, but
I still can't see the statue,

1112
01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:45.649
which is weird 'cause
it's the most important thing

1113
01:03:45.651 --> 01:03:46.883
in Jumanji and it's huge.

1114
01:03:46.885 --> 01:03:48.353
That's what she said.

1115
01:03:50.389 --> 01:03:52.489
You drunk, Fridge?

1116
01:03:52.491 --> 01:03:54.558
What are you talking about?
I ain't drunk.

1117
01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.494
- He is drunk.
- I had three little margaritas.

1118
01:03:57.496 --> 01:03:59.096
You're about
half your usual size.

1119
01:03:59.098 --> 01:04:00.698
Whatever, whatever.

1120
01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:03.468
Alex, what do we do?
How do we get past these guards?

1121
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:05.104
Last time,
I waited till they left.

1122
01:04:05.106 --> 01:04:06.437
How long did that take?

1123
01:04:06.439 --> 01:04:08.974
- Three weeks?
- Oh, we gonna die.

1124
01:04:08.976 --> 01:04:10.742
Okay. Plan B.

1125
01:04:10.744 --> 01:04:12.645
Maybe there's
another door somewhere.

1126
01:04:12.647 --> 01:04:15.482
But we gotta distract
those guys first.

1127
01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:16.850
I've got it.

1128
01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:19.418
Distracting guys is, like,
the main thing I do.

1129
01:04:19.420 --> 01:04:20.987
He plays video games,
I distract guys.

1130
01:04:20.989 --> 01:04:23.757
Bethany, I hate to break it
to you right now,

1131
01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:26.960
but you don't exactly
have the, um, the tool kit.

1132
01:04:26.962 --> 01:04:31.465
- Not me.
- What?

1133
01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:34.135
- You have to go down there and flirt with those guys...
- No.

1134
01:04:34.137 --> 01:04:36.605
- ...and hold their attention while we sneak in.
- No!

1135
01:04:36.607 --> 01:04:38.440
I can't just go over there
and flirt

1136
01:04:38.442 --> 01:04:40.007
with some weird soldiers
I don't know.

1137
01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:42.643
I know, but right now
we don't have a better idea.

1138
01:04:42.645 --> 01:04:45.883
You don't understand.
I actually can't do it.

1139
01:04:47.151 --> 01:04:48.984
I can't talk to guys.

1140
01:04:48.986 --> 01:04:50.820
I'm terrible at it.

1141
01:04:50.822 --> 01:04:53.488
I can give you some pointers.

1142
01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:57.059
No, I'm sorry. We
have to come up with another plan.

1143
01:04:57.061 --> 01:05:00.896
I'm not... No. Heh.
Not doing that.

1144
01:05:00.898 --> 01:05:03.533
Martha, you just have to
distract them long enough

1145
01:05:03.535 --> 01:05:04.801
for us
to get into the shed.

1146
01:05:04.803 --> 01:05:06.703
I really don't think
I can, I'm not...

1147
01:05:06.705 --> 01:05:10.774
Like, I'm not actually
some badass girl.

1148
01:05:10.776 --> 01:05:14.514
What are you talking about?
You're a total badass.

1149
01:05:16.849 --> 01:05:19.420
You could do anything.

1150
01:05:25.192 --> 01:05:26.926
That's beautiful, Spencer.

1151
01:05:26.928 --> 01:05:29.761
Why don't I set you up
with a nice candlelight dinner?

1152
01:05:29.763 --> 01:05:32.765
Or do you guys wanna get
the hell out of here?

1153
01:05:32.767 --> 01:05:34.165
All right.

1154
01:05:34.167 --> 01:05:36.167
Show me how it's done.

1155
01:05:36.169 --> 01:05:38.203
Class is in session.

1156
01:05:38.205 --> 01:05:39.672
- Come on, girl.
- Okay.

1157
01:05:39.674 --> 01:05:41.641
Watch and learn.

1158
01:05:41.643 --> 01:05:44.143
Hey, what did you mean by
that candlelight-dinner thing?

1159
01:05:44.145 --> 01:05:46.947
- What are you talking about?
- You said it, me and Martha,

1160
01:05:46.949 --> 01:05:49.249
candlelight dinner.
What does that even mean?

1161
01:05:49.251 --> 01:05:51.618
The girl is into you,
Spencer.

1162
01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:52.919
What?

1163
01:06:02.097 --> 01:06:04.030
Okay, in flirting
situations,

1164
01:06:04.032 --> 01:06:05.766
the key is making them
check you out

1165
01:06:05.768 --> 01:06:07.101
without letting them know

1166
01:06:07.103 --> 01:06:09.036
that you know that
they're checking you out.

1167
01:06:09.038 --> 01:06:11.573
You're like, "Whatever."
When they try to talk to you,

1168
01:06:11.575 --> 01:06:13.107
you can play it
one of three ways:

1169
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:15.678
dumb, super into it,
or nasty.

1170
01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.146
Which way you play it depends on
what guy you deal with.

1171
01:06:18.148 --> 01:06:20.983
This is like my dream and my
nightmare all at one time.

1172
01:06:20.985 --> 01:06:22.952
I'm not gonna
take that personally.

1173
01:06:22.954 --> 01:06:24.787
Now, hair is everything.

1174
01:06:24.789 --> 01:06:27.857
Touch it. Move it.
Play with it.

1175
01:06:27.859 --> 01:06:30.928
Move it around a lot.
Hypnotize them with it.

1176
01:06:30.930 --> 01:06:34.665
Give me a flip like that.
Okay, now angle your eyes down.

1177
01:06:34.667 --> 01:06:35.966
Now, head down.

1178
01:06:35.968 --> 01:06:37.672
Tilt up. Eyes big.

1179
01:06:38.304 --> 01:06:39.905
- Now sparkle.
- Sparkle?

1180
01:06:39.907 --> 01:06:42.173
Like an anime character.
Now sparkle.

1181
01:06:48.081 --> 01:06:50.014
Needs work.

1182
01:06:57.259 --> 01:06:58.857
Do you really think
she likes me?

1183
01:06:58.859 --> 01:07:00.693
Why are we still
talking about this?

1184
01:07:00.695 --> 01:07:02.628
I mean, what if
she tries to kiss me?

1185
01:07:02.630 --> 01:07:04.096
Then you just
kiss her back, man.

1186
01:07:04.098 --> 01:07:06.733
What if she tries
to kiss me, like...

1187
01:07:06.735 --> 01:07:08.869
Like, without warning?

1188
01:07:08.871 --> 01:07:11.938
What are you talking about?
Haven't you ever kissed anyone?

1189
01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:13.907
Don't... You gonna tell
the whole jungle?

1190
01:07:13.909 --> 01:07:15.843
Guys, I found
a side door. Over here.

1191
01:07:15.845 --> 01:07:17.979
- Guess what I found.
- No, no, don't tell him.

1192
01:07:17.981 --> 01:07:19.747
Okay, let's talk about
your walk.

1193
01:07:19.749 --> 01:07:21.115
Take your time.

1194
01:07:21.117 --> 01:07:24.286
Make a meal of it.
Like a gorgeous gazelle.

1195
01:07:24.288 --> 01:07:27.623
Or a horse. High-step it.
One foot in front of the other.

1196
01:07:27.625 --> 01:07:29.592
And bring it.
Boom, boom...

1197
01:07:29.594 --> 01:07:30.925
That's not it.

1198
01:07:30.927 --> 01:07:32.226
Yikes.

1199
01:07:32.228 --> 01:07:34.797
Anything you can do to
draw attention to the lips.

1200
01:07:34.799 --> 01:07:36.065
A little nibble like this.

1201
01:07:36.067 --> 01:07:39.101
A nibble goes
a long way, girlfriend.

1202
01:07:39.103 --> 01:07:41.338
Good. That's better.

1203
01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:43.205
Now smile.
You look terrified.

1204
01:07:43.207 --> 01:07:44.740
Oh, God,
you're so funny.

1205
01:07:44.742 --> 01:07:46.810
- You're so funny.
- Oh, God, you're so funny.

1206
01:07:46.812 --> 01:07:48.812
Oh, my God,
you're so funny.

1207
01:07:48.814 --> 01:07:51.382
- I think I'm getting it.
- You are getting it. Go, girl.

1208
01:07:51.384 --> 01:07:53.683
Now, keep your lips
slightly parted, like...

1209
01:07:53.685 --> 01:07:55.719
Yeah, not-not gross,
just relaxed.

1210
01:07:55.721 --> 01:07:57.621
Touch your tongue
to the roof of your mouth.

1211
01:07:57.623 --> 01:07:59.624
- Like this.
- Like this?

1212
01:07:59.626 --> 01:08:01.292
- Like this.
- Like this?

1213
01:08:01.294 --> 01:08:03.928
Like this.

1214
01:08:03.930 --> 01:08:05.896
Like this.

1215
01:08:05.898 --> 01:08:07.733
Like this?

1216
01:08:07.735 --> 01:08:09.100
I think you're ready.

1217
01:08:10.372 --> 01:08:12.236
- Cool.
- Okay, flirt

1218
01:08:12.238 --> 01:08:14.106
like our lives depend on it.

1219
01:08:14.108 --> 01:08:15.240
'Cause they do.

1220
01:08:15.242 --> 01:08:16.842
Okay, there's the door.

1221
01:08:16.844 --> 01:08:18.978
We just need something
to cut through the fence.

1222
01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:21.848
Okay, Fridge, you got anything
like that in the backpack?

1223
01:08:21.850 --> 01:08:24.717
Uh, yeah, I should. What...?

1224
01:08:24.719 --> 01:08:27.921
Here you go. I got some...
Some bolt cutters.

1225
01:08:27.923 --> 01:08:30.391
Does that seem like a good tool
for the situation?

1226
01:08:30.393 --> 01:08:32.693
Perfect, actually.

1227
01:08:32.695 --> 01:08:34.361
It's called backpack power,
baby.

1228
01:08:35.998 --> 01:08:37.731
You guys,

1229
01:08:37.733 --> 01:08:39.366
I think this is gonna work.

1230
01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:41.268
I think so too.
She's pretty fly.

1231
01:08:41.270 --> 01:08:43.972
And those guys don't meet
a lot of new people.

1232
01:08:43.974 --> 01:08:45.073
"Fly"?

1233
01:08:45.075 --> 01:08:46.874
Well, not like
Cindy Crawford fly,

1234
01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:49.143
but for Jumanji,
she the bomb.

1235
01:08:49.145 --> 01:08:50.679
"The bomb"?

1236
01:08:50.681 --> 01:08:52.415
- Cindy Crawford?
- That's your go-to?

1237
01:08:52.417 --> 01:08:53.915
I'm just saying, I'm sure

1238
01:08:53.917 --> 01:08:55.987
they'd like to
get jiggy with her.

1239
01:09:00.925 --> 01:09:01.925
Alex.

1240
01:09:02.895 --> 01:09:04.897
What year do you think it is?

1241
01:09:05.897 --> 01:09:08.165
- What do you mean?
- Oh, no.

1242
01:09:08.167 --> 01:09:10.669
It's 1996.

1243
01:09:13.373 --> 01:09:15.872
You're Alex Vreeke,
aren't you?

1244
01:09:15.874 --> 01:09:17.174
Yeah, that's right.

1245
01:09:17.176 --> 01:09:19.077
Wait a minute,
you mean Freak House?

1246
01:09:19.079 --> 01:09:21.845
Wait, what are you...
What are you guys talking about?

1247
01:09:21.847 --> 01:09:22.949
How do you know me?

1248
01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:27.085
Alex, I don't know how
to tell you this...

1249
01:09:27.087 --> 01:09:29.021
You've been in this game
for 20 years.

1250
01:09:29.023 --> 01:09:32.024
That's probably not
how I would've done it.

1251
01:09:32.026 --> 01:09:33.392
What?

1252
01:09:33.394 --> 01:09:35.462
No. You guys are messing
with me, right?

1253
01:09:35.464 --> 01:09:37.463
No, we're not.
Alex Vreeke.

1254
01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:39.865
Everybody in Brantford
knows about you.

1255
01:09:39.867 --> 01:09:42.768
You're the kid
that disappeared.

1256
01:09:42.770 --> 01:09:44.338
Twenty years ago.

1257
01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:46.307
Twenty years?

1258
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:49.075
Twenty years, man.

1259
01:09:49.077 --> 01:09:51.812
I don't even know
how to say this, but

1260
01:09:51.814 --> 01:09:54.014
Cindy Crawford, dude,
she's like 50 years old.

1261
01:09:54.016 --> 01:09:57.318
- But still fly.
- Eh.

1262
01:09:57.320 --> 01:09:59.822
Wait...

1263
01:10:04.762 --> 01:10:05.997
There she is.

1264
01:10:14.003 --> 01:10:15.172
Hey.

1265
01:10:16.907 --> 01:10:19.242
We're gonna get you home.

1266
01:10:19.244 --> 01:10:21.910
Yeah.

1267
01:10:42.002 --> 01:10:44.102
The hell is
going on with her butt?

1268
01:10:44.104 --> 01:10:46.036
Bethany, what did
you tell her to do?

1269
01:10:46.038 --> 01:10:48.106
Did she twist her ankle,
maybe, or...?

1270
01:10:48.108 --> 01:10:50.345
She's never flirted before.
Give her a break.

1271
01:10:54.915 --> 01:10:57.250
Hello, little lady.

1272
01:10:57.252 --> 01:10:59.288
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1273
01:11:01.589 --> 01:11:03.323
Hey, you guys.

1274
01:11:03.325 --> 01:11:05.891
I seem to be lost.

1275
01:11:05.893 --> 01:11:08.427
Can you guys help me?

1276
01:11:10.598 --> 01:11:13.199
Hello, little lady.

1277
01:11:13.201 --> 01:11:15.304
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1278
01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:21.276
You guys are so
interesting and funny.

1279
01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.577
What's she doing?

1280
01:11:22.579 --> 01:11:24.612
What, she got a bug
in her hair?

1281
01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:27.181
She's forgotten
all of our training.

1282
01:11:27.183 --> 01:11:28.787
Let's go.

1283
01:11:32.857 --> 01:11:36.057
Wait! I... I... I
have to tell you

1284
01:11:36.059 --> 01:11:38.361
about this book
that I've been reading.

1285
01:11:38.363 --> 01:11:40.295
About microbiology.

1286
01:11:40.297 --> 01:11:44.303
Which is one of
my favorite biologies.

1287
01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:52.275
Hello, little lady.

1288
01:11:52.277 --> 01:11:55.546
What are you doing
out here all alone?

1289
01:12:00.519 --> 01:12:03.924

What's the move?

01:12:59.417 --> 01:13:01.082
- What?
- What do we take?

Woo! Woo-hoo!

1333
01:14:14.364 --> 01:14:16.766
Go, go!

1334
01:14:16.768 --> 01:14:20.702
Yes! Yes! You're my hero.

1335
01:14:22.172 --> 01:14:24.106
- We gotta go.
- You should give me

1336
01:14:24.108 --> 01:14:25.442
lessons in kicking ass.

1337
01:14:25.444 --> 01:14:26.475
Give me a hug.

1338
01:14:26.477 --> 01:14:27.644
- Oh, my God.
- You did it.

1339
01:14:27.646 --> 01:14:29.479
- I did.
- Yeah, give me a hug, girlfriend.

1340
01:14:29.481 --> 01:14:32.283
As great of a moment as that is,
we ain't got the time.

1341
01:14:32.285 --> 01:14:33.750
- Yeah.
- They coming.

1342
01:14:33.752 --> 01:14:35.386
The motorcycle freaks
is coming.

1343
01:14:35.388 --> 01:14:37.555
Seaplane!
We got to fly, man.

1344
01:14:37.557 --> 01:14:40.157
Nope. I can't do it.

1345
01:14:40.159 --> 01:14:42.527
Okay? I told you,
I'm not a good pilot.

1346
01:14:42.529 --> 01:14:45.195
Maybe we should take
the school bus.

1347
01:14:45.197 --> 01:14:47.565
We can't outrun no motorcycle
on no damn bus!

1348
01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:49.601
You picked the plane
and hot-air balloon.

1349
01:14:49.603 --> 01:14:50.836
Maybe pick
the helicopter.

1350
01:14:50.838 --> 01:14:53.539
No, I can't do it. Okay?
I don't wanna die.

1351
01:14:53.541 --> 01:14:56.674
I'm freaking out
a little bit.

1352
01:14:56.676 --> 01:14:59.811
Fine. I'll do it.

1353
01:14:59.813 --> 01:15:01.815
How hard can it be?
It's a helicopter.

1354
01:15:01.817 --> 01:15:03.715
You... You press
a button, the...

1355
01:15:03.717 --> 01:15:05.384
They gonna spin. Okay.

1356
01:15:05.386 --> 01:15:07.821
Then after that, I got my...
The... The lever.

1357
01:15:07.823 --> 01:15:09.621
That's how...
That's how you getting

1358
01:15:09.623 --> 01:15:11.090
the forward-backward action.

1359
01:15:11.092 --> 01:15:13.727
Once we in the air,
I'mma be all right.

1360
01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:15.595
This, I just gotta get...

1361
01:15:15.597 --> 01:15:17.564
'Cause it ain't got
no step stool, so...

1362
01:15:17.566 --> 01:15:19.834
Let me see something.
I can probably just...

1363
01:15:19.836 --> 01:15:21.336
Get in, but be careful.

1364
01:15:21.338 --> 01:15:23.337
- No, you're drunk.
- No way. Nuh-uh.

1365
01:15:23.339 --> 01:15:25.607
Fridge, you're drunk.
Give me the keys.

1366
01:15:25.609 --> 01:15:28.209
- I'm?
- Alex. Alex.

1367
01:15:28.211 --> 01:15:29.543
If I can fight
those guys,

1368
01:15:29.545 --> 01:15:32.347
you can fly this helicopter.
I know you can.

1369
01:15:32.349 --> 01:15:33.715
Come on.

1370
01:15:35.852 --> 01:15:38.386
Alex.

1371
01:15:38.388 --> 01:15:40.756
This is where we need you.

1372
01:15:40.758 --> 01:15:44.196
Remember,
you're the missing piece.

1373
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:50.566
Seaplane McDonough
reporting for duty.

1374
01:15:50.568 --> 01:15:51.767
Let's go, people.

1375
01:16:12.758 --> 01:16:14.192
Whoa!

1376
01:16:14.194 --> 01:16:16.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1377
01:16:23.338 --> 01:16:25.739
- What's wrong?
- Something's broken!

1378
01:16:25.741 --> 01:16:26.806
- What?
- What do you mean?

1379
01:16:26.808 --> 01:16:29.775
Hang on!

1380
01:16:35.317 --> 01:16:37.384
Oh, my God,
we're about to die!

1381
01:16:37.386 --> 01:16:38.688
We're about to die!

1382
01:16:46.595 --> 01:16:48.963
- Oh, my God!
- It won't go up!

1383
01:16:48.965 --> 01:16:50.831
- What?
- What do you mean?

1384
01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:52.232
The collective is busted.

1385
01:16:52.234 --> 01:16:53.701
- What?
- It controls the plate up there,

1386
01:16:53.703 --> 01:16:56.237
which tilts the rotors
and controls the pitch.

1387
01:16:56.239 --> 01:16:58.343
It's how we go up and down.

1388
01:17:05.550 --> 01:17:07.416
You guys?

1389
01:17:07.418 --> 01:17:10.155
- That can't be good.
- It's no way that's good news.

1390
01:17:17.762 --> 01:17:19.298
Albino rhinos!

1391
01:17:23.336 --> 01:17:24.768
They're indigenous
to Jumanji.

1392
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.870
They're huge,
white, scary, and stupid,

1393
01:17:26.872 --> 01:17:28.643
- and they eat people.
- No.

1394
01:17:31.445 --> 01:17:32.811
They're getting close!

1395
01:17:32.813 --> 01:17:35.313
My stomach's starting
to bother me a bit.

1396
01:17:35.315 --> 01:17:37.549
- Go up!
- I can't go up!

1397
01:17:37.551 --> 01:17:39.418
I think I had
too many margaritas.

1398
01:17:43.757 --> 01:17:46.259
You guys,
what are we gonna do?

1399
01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:47.594
I'll fix the helicopter.

1400
01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:49.027
- Yes!
- Tell me what to do.

1401
01:17:49.029 --> 01:17:51.298
You gotta connect
the flight-control rod

1402
01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.732
to the mesh plate
under the rotors.

1403
01:17:52.734 --> 01:17:55.469
Flight-control rod, mesh plate,
under the rotors.

1404
01:17:55.471 --> 01:17:57.438
- Wait, what?
- I'll be right back.

1405
01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:01.442
- Spencer, where are you going?
- Hurry up.

1406
01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:02.976
- Be careful!
- No, no, just hurry up!

1407
01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:05.647
All right, just
gonna stand on this thingy,

1408
01:18:05.649 --> 01:18:09.587
pull myself up towards these
deadly helicopter blades. Okay.

1409
01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.888
There's the mesh plate.

1410
01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.623
Here's that rod thingy.

1411
01:18:25.536 --> 01:18:27.839
- Spencer!
- Speed it up, Alex!

1412
01:18:37.684 --> 01:18:39.319
Spencer!

1413
01:18:41.988 --> 01:18:45.260
Hurry! Come on, fix it!

1414
01:18:50.763 --> 01:18:53.331
- Oh, my God!
- Running out of time!

1415
01:18:53.333 --> 01:18:55.270
- Fix it, please!
- No, no, no.

1416
01:18:55.936 --> 01:18:57.739
Got it!

1417
01:19:05.012 --> 01:19:08.081
We made it! You did it!
I thought we were gonna die.

1418
01:19:08.083 --> 01:19:09.382
- Oh.
- Yes!

1419
01:19:09.384 --> 01:19:10.917
- Nice!
- Thank you.

1420
01:19:10.919 --> 01:19:13.753
- Thank you, guys.
- You did it. That was scary.

1421
01:19:13.755 --> 01:19:15.087
Oops.

1422
01:19:15.089 --> 01:19:16.692
What?

1423
01:19:17.893 --> 01:19:19.525
I dropped the jewel.

1424
01:19:19.527 --> 01:19:20.961
What?

1425
01:19:20.963 --> 01:19:22.029
You dropped the jewel?

1426
01:19:22.031 --> 01:19:23.498
I leaned over,

1427
01:19:23.500 --> 01:19:25.132
thought I had to puke,
and I didn't.

1428
01:19:25.134 --> 01:19:26.567
It came out
of my backpack.

1429
01:19:26.569 --> 01:19:28.703
- We need the freaking jewel!
- I know.

1430
01:19:28.705 --> 01:19:31.705
That's-that's-that's the crazy
part 'cause I know we need it.

1431
01:19:31.707 --> 01:19:33.674
So we're in a pickle.
We're in a pickle.

1432
01:19:33.676 --> 01:19:35.443
Turn around.
We gotta go get it.

1433
01:19:35.445 --> 01:19:37.446
Yeah, let's loop around.
Look for it.

1434
01:19:37.448 --> 01:19:38.613
Everybody open your eyes.

1435
01:19:38.615 --> 01:19:40.519
Let's all look for it
as a group.

1436
01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.428
There! I see it!

1437
01:19:57.069 --> 01:19:58.702
What are they doing?

1438
01:19:58.704 --> 01:20:00.937
It's like they're
protecting it or something.

1439
01:20:00.939 --> 01:20:04.441
- How are we gonna do this?
- I don't know.

1440
01:20:04.443 --> 01:20:06.476
Well, you gotta go get it,
right, buddy?

1441
01:20:10.083 --> 01:20:12.015
What do you need?
Your boomerang?

1442
01:20:12.017 --> 01:20:13.785
Maybe some scissors?

1443
01:20:13.787 --> 01:20:16.020
A pipe wrench?
Some shoelaces?

1444
01:20:16.022 --> 01:20:19.024
I'm your valet. Whatever
you need, I can get it for you.

1445
01:20:19.026 --> 01:20:21.692
Okay? You just say the word.

1446
01:20:21.694 --> 01:20:23.495
- What?
- I'm sorry, buddy.

1447
01:20:23.497 --> 01:20:24.497
Sorry for what?

1448
01:20:26.166 --> 01:20:27.800
Ow!

1449
01:20:34.943 --> 01:20:36.446
No.

1450
01:20:49.225 --> 01:20:50.859
Turn us around.

1451
01:20:50.861 --> 01:20:52.397
No!

1452
01:20:54.897 --> 01:20:57.799
Heel! Heel! Stop!

1453
01:20:57.801 --> 01:20:59.667
Oh, my God!

1454
01:20:59.669 --> 01:21:02.069
- No!
- Alex, get ready to roll us

1455
01:21:02.071 --> 01:21:03.538
- to the side.
- What?

1456
01:21:05.076 --> 01:21:07.880
SPENCER; When I tell you,
roll 90 degrees to the right.

1457
01:21:09.214 --> 01:21:10.214
Now!

1458
01:21:14.620 --> 01:21:17.588
You pushed me out
the helicopter, jackass!

1459
01:21:20.225 --> 01:21:22.092
Oh, wow!

1460
01:21:22.094 --> 01:21:24.828
- Spencer, you're amazing.
- Thank you.

1461
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:26.731
You are a killer pilot, Alex.

1462
01:21:26.733 --> 01:21:28.700
- Thanks.
- You too, Spencer,

1463
01:21:28.702 --> 01:21:30.701
- you were incredible!
- Thank you...

1464
01:21:30.703 --> 01:21:32.836
- Hey!
- ...but he was amazing, our pilot.

1465
01:21:32.838 --> 01:21:34.572
- Excuse me.
- You killed it.

1466
01:21:34.574 --> 01:21:35.740
Excuse me.

1467
01:21:35.742 --> 01:21:36.907
Excuse me!

1468
01:21:36.909 --> 01:21:38.977
I'm the one that
was a human sacrifice.

1469
01:21:38.979 --> 01:21:42.715
You don't know what's on
the underside of those rhinos.

1470
01:21:42.717 --> 01:21:44.649
And you don't wanna know.

1471
01:21:44.651 --> 01:21:46.985
I've seen a lot of things.

1472
01:21:46.987 --> 01:21:48.953
Felt them on my face too.

1473
01:21:48.955 --> 01:21:51.891
Things that I will never be able
to erase from memory.

1474
01:21:53.262 --> 01:21:54.727
Oh, that's funny to you guys.

1475
01:21:54.729 --> 01:21:57.066
Go ahead, laugh it up.
Get it out.

1476
01:21:59.701 --> 01:22:01.668
Guys, I've been trying
to get across

1477
01:22:01.670 --> 01:22:03.603
this canyon for, like,
20 years, okay?

1478
01:22:03.605 --> 01:22:05.204
Do you realize
how huge this is?

1479
01:22:10.013 --> 01:22:11.244
Mosquito.

1480
01:22:11.246 --> 01:22:13.914
No, no, no!
Alex, no, no, no!

1481
01:22:13.916 --> 01:22:16.116
- Alex.
- Alex, no, no.

1482
01:22:16.118 --> 01:22:17.553
Alex?

1483
01:22:17.555 --> 01:22:19.821
Alex, talk to me.
Wake up. Here we go.

1484
01:22:19.823 --> 01:22:21.623
Alex? He's dying.

1485
01:22:21.625 --> 01:22:23.626
No, we can't let him die.
We're too close!

1486
01:22:23.628 --> 01:22:25.126
Does anyone
know how to do CPR?

1487
01:22:25.128 --> 01:22:28.264
Yeah, start with three chest
compressions and mouth-to-mouth.

1488
01:22:28.266 --> 01:22:30.198
One, two, three.

1489
01:22:30.200 --> 01:22:31.901
How do I do this?

1490
01:22:31.903 --> 01:22:33.736
Okay, pinch his nose,
open his mouth,

1491
01:22:33.738 --> 01:22:35.004
- full lip-lock.
- Okay.

1492
01:22:35.006 --> 01:22:38.645
Ah, one breath, two breaths,
then repeat.

1493
01:22:46.651 --> 01:22:48.655
Come on, Alex.

1494
01:22:51.190 --> 01:22:53.794
Bethany, stop. Your tattoo.

1495
01:22:55.062 --> 01:22:57.865
It looks like you're giving him
one of your lives.

1496
01:22:59.634 --> 01:23:00.966
I'm okay with that.

1497
01:23:00.968 --> 01:23:02.735
What if you need it
for yourself?

1498
01:23:02.737 --> 01:23:04.940
I want Alex to come home too.

1499
01:23:19.188 --> 01:23:21.220
Oh!

1500
01:23:28.130 --> 01:23:29.863
- What happened?
- Alex,

1501
01:23:29.865 --> 01:23:32.301
Bethany gave you
one of her lives.

1502
01:23:32.303 --> 01:23:33.667
Bethany, you okay?

1503
01:23:33.669 --> 01:23:34.868
I think so.

1504
01:23:34.870 --> 01:23:36.337
Bethany,
is that true?

1505
01:23:36.339 --> 01:23:38.673
You gave me
one of your lives?

1506
01:23:38.675 --> 01:23:40.676
I mean, yeah, of course.

1507
01:23:40.678 --> 01:23:42.981
Thank you.

1508
01:23:52.022 --> 01:23:53.690
What? What are
you looking at?

1509
01:23:53.692 --> 01:23:54.993
You got a situation.

1510
01:23:58.162 --> 01:24:01.064
Oh, my God,
these things are crazy.

1511
01:24:15.848 --> 01:24:17.918
Twenty years,
huh?

1512
01:24:18.886 --> 01:24:20.989
Yeah,
I guess so.

1513
01:24:24.958 --> 01:24:26.157
You know,

1514
01:24:26.159 --> 01:24:29.095
I just keep thinking about
my poor parents.

1515
01:24:29.097 --> 01:24:31.064
And what they must've
been through.

1516
01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:34.067
And why, because I was sitting
in my hideout,

1517
01:24:34.069 --> 01:24:35.904
too afraid
to finish the game?

1518
01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:41.275
I'm sorry.

1519
01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:44.445
I don't mean to lay this on you.
I'm just...

1520
01:24:44.447 --> 01:24:46.380
You're really easy
to talk to.

1521
01:24:46.382 --> 01:24:49.216
No, I get it.
I mean, sometimes

1522
01:24:49.218 --> 01:24:52.218
it's easy to get so focused
on your own stuff

1523
01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:55.893
that you forget other people
have problems too.

1524
01:24:56.926 --> 01:24:58.326
That's really deep.

1525
01:24:58.328 --> 01:25:01.796
Thanks. I feel like
ever since I lost my phone,

1526
01:25:01.798 --> 01:25:03.901
my other senses have
kind of heightened.

1527
01:25:05.269 --> 01:25:08.806
Does "phone" mean something
different in the future?

1528
01:25:13.077 --> 01:25:15.111
What about you, Alex?
What are you like?

1529
01:25:15.113 --> 01:25:18.051
In the real world.
What's your vibe?

1530
01:25:19.285 --> 01:25:20.850
Full-on
metalhead.

1531
01:25:20.852 --> 01:25:23.823
A drummer, like my dad.

1532
01:25:38.438 --> 01:25:39.973
Hey.

1533
01:25:41.942 --> 01:25:43.508
- Hey.
- What are you doing?

1534
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:45.944
I, uh, I was just
filling these up.

1535
01:25:45.946 --> 01:25:48.149
- Cool.
- Yeah.

1536
01:25:52.118 --> 01:25:54.055
I'm glad you're here.
I, uh, ahem...

1537
01:25:55.890 --> 01:25:58.559
- I have something to tell you.
- Yeah?

1538
01:25:58.561 --> 01:26:00.192
And I wanna tell you now,

1539
01:26:00.194 --> 01:26:01.528
just in case
the next time

1540
01:26:01.530 --> 01:26:05.901
that we talk
I'm no longer brave.

1541
01:26:08.236 --> 01:26:09.839
I like you, Martha.

1542
01:26:10.906 --> 01:26:13.475
I, like, like you.

1543
01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:17.578
Like,
I'm fully into you.

1544
01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:20.414
- You are?
- I am.

1545
01:26:20.416 --> 01:26:22.184
And I have been

1546
01:26:22.186 --> 01:26:24.755
since, like,
the seventh grade.

1547
01:26:26.056 --> 01:26:27.056
Really?

1548
01:26:28.425 --> 01:26:31.394
Wowza. I don't think
this has ever happened before.

1549
01:26:31.396 --> 01:26:34.163
- What do you mean?
- Oh, I mean, like, I don't think

1550
01:26:34.165 --> 01:26:38.100
anyone's ever liked me that I...
I can't believe I'm doing this.

1551
01:26:38.102 --> 01:26:40.205
I never tell anyone
how I fe...

1552
01:26:43.141 --> 01:26:45.778
I'm into you too,
Spencer.

1553
01:26:46.878 --> 01:26:49.111
- You are?
- Yes. Yes! Heh, heh!

1554
01:26:49.113 --> 01:26:53.050
God, you're smart
and sweet and cute.

1555
01:26:53.052 --> 01:26:55.185
Yeah, I'm pretty into you.

1556
01:26:57.325 --> 01:27:02.960
Wait. Are you sure it's not
because of, like, all of...?

1557
01:27:02.962 --> 01:27:05.029
What? Oh, my God, no, no.

1558
01:27:05.031 --> 01:27:07.600
That is not my type.
I'm into nerds.

1559
01:27:07.602 --> 01:27:09.969
Really?

1560
01:27:09.971 --> 01:27:11.437
I'm a nerd.

1561
01:27:31.261 --> 01:27:33.994
- That was... I was so awful.
- I've never kissed anyone.

1562
01:27:33.996 --> 01:27:36.230
- You've never...?
- Never. That was the first time.

1563
01:27:36.232 --> 01:27:37.665
- I have never.
- Oh, you haven't?

1564
01:27:37.667 --> 01:27:39.033
- No.
- Okay. Cool.

1565
01:27:39.035 --> 01:27:41.405
You can't tell, right?

1566
01:27:44.375 --> 01:27:46.241
Come on. Hey!

1567
01:27:46.243 --> 01:27:49.076
I don't wanna see that.
I don't, not today.

1568
01:27:49.078 --> 01:27:51.146
While you're down here
professing your love

1569
01:27:51.148 --> 01:27:53.983
for one another,
I found the Jaguar.

1570
01:27:53.985 --> 01:27:57.586
Let's go. God! Ugh!

1571
01:28:07.499 --> 01:28:10.133
- There it is.
- There it is.

1572
01:28:10.135 --> 01:28:12.239
We'd better get walking.

1573
01:28:34.095 --> 01:28:37.099
I think we just
follow this path.

1574
01:28:38.198 --> 01:28:40.470
No. It can't be that easy.

1575
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:44.407
"The Defenders."

1576
01:28:45.708 --> 01:28:47.278
What does
that mean?

1577
01:28:48.344 --> 01:28:50.280
There's only one way
to find out.

1578
01:28:52.449 --> 01:28:54.381
Fridge,

1579
01:28:54.383 --> 01:28:55.649
give me the jewel.

1580
01:28:59.222 --> 01:29:00.492
Spencer.

1581
01:29:16.206 --> 01:29:18.107
Something's about to happen.

1582
01:29:18.109 --> 01:29:20.142
I hate those drums.

1583
01:29:20.144 --> 01:29:23.245
What, you're just gonna
walk in there?

1584
01:29:23.247 --> 01:29:24.615
No.

1585
01:29:24.617 --> 01:29:28.555
That's what the game wants us
to do. Follow the path.

1586
01:29:29.756 --> 01:29:31.959
It's a trap.

1587
01:29:37.364 --> 01:29:39.366
"When you see the elephant...

1588
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:42.971
begin the climb."

1589
01:29:48.208 --> 01:29:49.675
I'll go through the trees.

1590
01:29:49.677 --> 01:29:51.108
- The trees?
- Yeah.

1591
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:52.612
Do you think
that's what that means?

1592
01:29:52.614 --> 01:29:53.712
That must be it.

1593
01:29:53.714 --> 01:29:55.515
That's the move.

1594
01:29:55.517 --> 01:29:58.384
This is the final level
of the game.

1595
01:29:58.386 --> 01:30:01.491
And I'm pretty sure
this is a Bravestone thing.

1596
01:30:06.327 --> 01:30:08.762
Did he just refer to himself
in the third person?

1597
01:30:08.764 --> 01:30:12.234
Um, fourth person, I think.

1598
01:30:18.675 --> 01:30:20.708
How does he do that?

1599
01:30:20.710 --> 01:30:23.143
Climbing is one
of his strengths.

1600
01:30:23.145 --> 01:30:25.313
Oh. Gotcha.

1601
01:30:25.315 --> 01:30:28.152
Cake makes me
explode.

1602
01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:52.443
- No! Spencer!
- Oh, my God!

1603
01:30:52.445 --> 01:30:54.712
Spencer!

1604
01:30:54.714 --> 01:30:57.681
Spencer!

1605
01:31:02.155 --> 01:31:03.722
Oh, my God, you guys.
Panthers.

1606
01:31:03.724 --> 01:31:05.326
No.

1607
01:31:09.563 --> 01:31:12.100
Those are jaguars.

1608
01:31:32.622 --> 01:31:34.389
Spencer!

1609
01:31:34.391 --> 01:31:36.223
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

1610
01:31:36.225 --> 01:31:38.359
Yeah. I think so.

1611
01:31:38.361 --> 01:31:41.262
You still have the jewel,
right?

1612
01:31:41.264 --> 01:31:42.764
- I got it.
- Oh, thank God.

1613
01:31:42.766 --> 01:31:43.899
Hey, what happened?

1614
01:31:43.901 --> 01:31:46.401
I don't wanna talk
about it.

1615
01:31:46.403 --> 01:31:48.203
Okay, we need a new plan.

1616
01:31:48.205 --> 01:31:49.437
- Yeah.
- Right.

1617
01:31:49.439 --> 01:31:51.676
- Totally.
- Spencer, any ideas?

1618
01:31:53.611 --> 01:31:56.282
Can I speak with you
for a minute?

1619
01:31:57.514 --> 01:31:58.683
Now?

1620
01:32:00.919 --> 01:32:03.122
What's going on?

1621
01:32:03.855 --> 01:32:05.388
I can't do this.

1622
01:32:05.390 --> 01:32:08.692
- What are you talking about?
- I can't do this.

1623
01:32:08.694 --> 01:32:11.861
Okay, who am I kidding?
I'm not some adventurer.

1624
01:32:11.863 --> 01:32:14.398
I'm not actually brave.

1625
01:32:14.400 --> 01:32:16.800
Spencer, I just saw you
hanging out of a helicopter.

1626
01:32:16.802 --> 01:32:20.271
It's a lot easier to be brave
when you have lives to spare.

1627
01:32:20.273 --> 01:32:21.609
It's a lot harder...

1628
01:32:22.742 --> 01:32:24.943
when you only have one life.

1629
01:32:26.347 --> 01:32:29.847
We-we always only have
one life, man.

1630
01:32:29.849 --> 01:32:33.786
Okay? That's... That's all
we get. That's how it works.

1631
01:32:33.788 --> 01:32:37.489
The question is,
is how are you gonna live it?

1632
01:32:37.491 --> 01:32:40.396
Which guy are
you gonna decide to be?

1633
01:32:42.464 --> 01:32:43.963
Did I just quote
our principal?

1634
01:32:43.965 --> 01:32:47.567
What the hell is this game doing
to me? I gotta get out of here.

1635
01:32:47.569 --> 01:32:48.834
Look.

1636
01:32:48.836 --> 01:32:51.240
We can do this, man.

1637
01:32:52.007 --> 01:32:53.577
We can do it together.

1638
01:32:57.247 --> 01:33:00.451
- Together.
- Together.

1639
01:33:02.319 --> 01:33:04.455
You're a good friend,
Fridge.

1640
01:33:07.824 --> 01:33:09.427
All right.

1641
01:33:10.462 --> 01:33:12.729
Okay. I don't know
video games,

1642
01:33:12.731 --> 01:33:14.996
but what I do know
is football.

1643
01:33:14.998 --> 01:33:17.934
Now, those lightning-fast,
man-eating cats out there?

1644
01:33:17.936 --> 01:33:19.469
They're the Defenders.

1645
01:33:19.471 --> 01:33:21.871
Which means we gotta run
one hell of an offense.

1646
01:33:21.873 --> 01:33:23.006
You guys.

1647
01:33:25.843 --> 01:33:27.343
We gotta go.

1648
01:33:27.345 --> 01:33:29.382
All right.
Here's what we're gonna do.

1649
01:33:31.916 --> 01:33:34.552
<i>We're gonna fan out
and run a play that I call:</i>

1650
01:33:34.554 --> 01:33:36.819
<i>"The Double Reverse
Refrigerator."</i>

1651
01:33:36.821 --> 01:33:39.824
<i>Bethany,
you go up the left side.</i>

1652
01:33:39.826 --> 01:33:41.493
<i>I'll go up the right.</i>

1653
01:33:41.495 --> 01:33:43.395
<i>Alex, you'll draw
the defense,</i>

1654
01:33:43.397 --> 01:33:44.863
<i>so Spencer can go
up the middle.</i>

1655
01:33:44.865 --> 01:33:46.765
<i>- I'll go with Spencer.
- No.</i>

1656
01:33:46.767 --> 01:33:48.767
<i>There's something else
we need you to do.</i>

1657
01:33:50.036 --> 01:33:53.638
<i>♪ Ooh, baby
I love your way ♪</i>

1658
01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:56.642
<i>♪ Every day, yeah ♪</i>

1659
01:33:56.644 --> 01:34:00.079
<i>♪ Ooh, baby
I love your way ♪</i>

1660
01:34:00.081 --> 01:34:01.715
You guys like to dance?

1661
01:34:03.552 --> 01:34:08.658
<i>♪ Shadows grow so long
Before my eyes ♪</i>

1662
01:34:18.668 --> 01:34:20.835
Hey! Over here!

1663
01:34:20.837 --> 01:34:22.806
Come and get me!

1664
01:34:36.954 --> 01:34:40.990
<i>♪ I wanna tell you, I wanna
Tell you, I wanna tell you ♪</i>

1665
01:34:47.099 --> 01:34:49.602
No! No.

1666
01:35:00.913 --> 01:35:02.450
- Thanks.
- Sure.

1667
01:35:04.951 --> 01:35:06.721
Get to the statue. Go!

1668
01:35:26.941 --> 01:35:28.444
Oh, no! I...

1669
01:36:04.114 --> 01:36:07.686
Ah, whoa, whoa.

1670
01:36:38.552 --> 01:36:40.987
Oh, man. Okay.

1671
01:36:40.989 --> 01:36:43.055
Stay calm, don't panic.

1672
01:36:43.057 --> 01:36:44.693
Stop!

1673
01:36:49.230 --> 01:36:51.032
It's the elephant
and the mouse.

1674
01:36:52.802 --> 01:36:54.200
What's up?

1675
01:36:54.202 --> 01:36:56.170
Mouse Finbar.

1676
01:36:56.172 --> 01:36:58.273
Zoologist.

1677
01:36:58.275 --> 01:37:00.875
Zoologist and...

1678
01:37:00.877 --> 01:37:03.045
And backpack guy.

1679
01:37:22.268 --> 01:37:25.672
Give me the jewel,
or your friend dies.

1680
01:37:27.273 --> 01:37:29.572
- Don't give it to him!
- Quiet!

1681
01:37:29.574 --> 01:37:31.008
Stop!

1682
01:37:35.780 --> 01:37:38.752
Take me instead,
okay?

1683
01:37:47.328 --> 01:37:48.896
Give me the jewel.

1684
01:37:49.963 --> 01:37:51.296
I can't do that.

1685
01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:53.130
Five.

1686
01:37:53.132 --> 01:37:56.601
- Four, three...
- I can't give you the jewel.

1687
01:37:56.603 --> 01:37:58.002
- Spencer.
- Two!

1688
01:37:58.004 --> 01:38:00.038
Because I don't have it!

1689
01:38:07.683 --> 01:38:09.585
Zoology, bitch!

1690
01:38:21.064 --> 01:38:22.996
No, no, no! Don't...

1691
01:38:29.739 --> 01:38:32.441
Douche bag! You suck!

1692
01:38:36.313 --> 01:38:38.683
- Elephant.
- "Begin the climb."

1693
01:38:41.719 --> 01:38:43.786
Leave her alone!

1694
01:38:43.788 --> 01:38:45.755
Get up there,
I'll get the jewel to you.

1695
01:38:45.757 --> 01:38:46.989
- Martha.
- Trust me.

1696
01:38:46.991 --> 01:38:48.960
- I'll get it to you. Go.
- Okay.

1697
01:38:55.968 --> 01:38:57.804
Go, Martha!

1698
01:39:05.278 --> 01:39:06.645
Alex!

1699
01:40:06.778 --> 01:40:08.681
I'll take that.

1700
01:40:21.127 --> 01:40:23.461
Game over.

1701
01:40:33.340 --> 01:40:34.976
I don't think so.

1702
01:40:39.848 --> 01:40:41.182
Venom's my weakness.

1703
01:41:11.114 --> 01:41:12.116
Go, Spencer.

1704
01:41:22.125 --> 01:41:23.195
No.

1705
01:41:35.139 --> 01:41:36.776
- Yeah! - Wow!
- Yeah.

1706
01:41:49.956 --> 01:41:51.423
"Call out its name."

1707
01:41:51.425 --> 01:41:52.558
Call out its name!

1708
01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:54.293
Call out its name, everyone!

1709
01:41:54.295 --> 01:41:55.893
Jumanji!

1710
01:41:55.895 --> 01:41:59.365
Jumanji!

1711
01:42:40.210 --> 01:42:42.277
- I think we did it.
- I think we won.

1712
01:42:42.279 --> 01:42:44.179
I think we did.

1713
01:42:44.181 --> 01:42:46.349
Guys,
it's Nigel.

1714
01:42:46.351 --> 01:42:47.984
Nigel.

1715
01:42:56.161 --> 01:42:58.496
Well done,
intrepid adventurers!

1716
01:42:58.498 --> 01:42:59.996
You lifted the curse!

1717
01:42:59.998 --> 01:43:02.300
All of Jumanji thanks you.

1718
01:43:02.302 --> 01:43:03.600
Your work here is done.

1719
01:43:03.602 --> 01:43:06.571
So, sadly,
this is where we part.

1720
01:43:06.573 --> 01:43:08.439
Seaplane McDonough,

1721
01:43:08.441 --> 01:43:10.144
let me shake your hand.

1722
01:43:17.351 --> 01:43:18.853
Alex.

1723
01:43:23.457 --> 01:43:25.893
Adieu, Professor Oberon.

1724
01:43:31.666 --> 01:43:33.269
Later, dude.

1725
01:43:39.274 --> 01:43:41.275
I'll miss you the most,
my little Mouse.

1726
01:43:41.277 --> 01:43:43.380
Get me the hell
out of here.

1727
01:43:51.119 --> 01:43:53.155
Farewell, Ruby Roundhouse.

1728
01:43:54.425 --> 01:43:56.023
Wait.

1729
01:43:56.025 --> 01:43:57.995
What if we didn't go back?

1730
01:43:59.496 --> 01:44:01.098
I just...

1731
01:44:02.199 --> 01:44:06.005
I like being like this.
With you.

1732
01:44:07.004 --> 01:44:10.274
Then let's be like this,

1733
01:44:10.276 --> 01:44:12.143
every day.

1734
01:44:13.478 --> 01:44:15.948
Just come home.

1735
01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:34.468
Dr. Bravestone.

1736
01:44:46.748 --> 01:44:50.218
Nigel, I'm ready to go home.

1737
01:44:51.151 --> 01:44:53.088
Farewell, my good man.

1738
01:44:58.026 --> 01:45:00.163
See you later,
Bravestone.

1739
01:45:30.227 --> 01:45:31.428
Oh, my God.

1740
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:34.731
Yes, yes, yes! Yes, yes!
I'm back, baby!

1741
01:45:34.733 --> 01:45:37.468
I will never complain
about my body ever again.

1742
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:38.768
Oh, thank God.

1743
01:45:38.770 --> 01:45:40.272
Oh, I missed you.

1744
01:45:46.379 --> 01:45:47.481
Where's Alex?

1745
01:46:09.838 --> 01:46:12.140
Wait, look.

1746
01:46:15.577 --> 01:46:17.146
Freak House?

1747
01:46:20.849 --> 01:46:22.517
Do you think...?

1748
01:46:22.519 --> 01:46:25.121
That means, maybe...

1749
01:46:35.266 --> 01:46:37.268
- Grandpa!
- Hey!

1750
01:46:38.668 --> 01:46:42.371
Come here. Come here.
Oh, that's my girl.

1751
01:46:42.373 --> 01:46:45.674
- Hi!
- So good to see you.

1752
01:46:45.676 --> 01:46:48.345
Come on. Come on
and say hi to Grandma.

1753
01:46:48.347 --> 01:46:50.447
- Alex?
- Hey, Dad, when you get a sec,

1754
01:46:50.449 --> 01:46:52.882
- could you give us a hand?
- Yeah.

1755
01:46:52.884 --> 01:46:55.417
Oh, that is some tree.

1756
01:46:55.419 --> 01:46:58.391
- Yeah, it's not too bad.
- Yeah.

1757
01:47:02.862 --> 01:47:04.628
Hey, Dad, will you
give me a second?

1758
01:47:04.630 --> 01:47:07.233
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- I'll be right back.

1759
01:47:21.415 --> 01:47:22.517
Bethany?

1760
01:47:24.952 --> 01:47:28.123
- Spencer?
- Yeah.

1761
01:47:28.823 --> 01:47:29.889
Ruby Roundhouse?

1762
01:47:33.628 --> 01:47:35.432
And that
would make you Fridge.

1763
01:47:39.936 --> 01:47:41.969
I'm stoked to see you.

1764
01:47:41.971 --> 01:47:43.507
All of you.

1765
01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:47.275
- You made it back.
- Yeah, I did.

1766
01:47:47.277 --> 01:47:50.281
It spit me out
right where I started, so...

1767
01:47:51.581 --> 01:47:52.913
1996.

1768
01:47:52.915 --> 01:47:55.883
And your parents
and your house?

1769
01:47:55.885 --> 01:47:58.723
Yeah, they... All good, bro.

1770
01:48:02.292 --> 01:48:04.560
You're an adult now.

1771
01:48:04.562 --> 01:48:05.995
You have a family.

1772
01:48:05.997 --> 01:48:07.929
I do, yeah.

1773
01:48:07.931 --> 01:48:09.932
This is Andy.

1774
01:48:09.934 --> 01:48:11.535
And then my daughter...

1775
01:48:11.537 --> 01:48:14.774
My daughter's name
is Bethany.

1776
01:48:17.309 --> 01:48:19.742
We named her after the girl
who saved my life.

1777
01:48:26.686 --> 01:48:28.789
So stoked. Heh.

1778
01:48:48.743 --> 01:48:50.008
Yo.

1779
01:48:50.010 --> 01:48:51.479
Yo.

1780
01:48:52.480 --> 01:48:56.048
You wanna
go backpacking?

1781
01:48:56.050 --> 01:48:58.451
Like, in nature?

1782
01:48:58.453 --> 01:49:01.321
Yeah, but, like, somewhere,
like, really amazing.

1783
01:49:01.323 --> 01:49:03.924
Next summer?
What do you think?

1784
01:49:03.926 --> 01:49:06.463
- Are you okay?
- Hey.

1785
01:49:07.630 --> 01:49:09.562
Oh, um,
I'll catch you later.

1786
01:49:09.564 --> 01:49:11.368
I'll see you after class?

1787
01:49:12.369 --> 01:49:14.469
- Hey!
- Hello.

1788
01:49:14.471 --> 01:49:16.571
- Hey.
- So, uh, anything...

1789
01:49:16.573 --> 01:49:18.306
interesting
happen lately?

1790
01:49:18.308 --> 01:49:20.342
No, I can't think
of anything.

1791
01:49:20.344 --> 01:49:21.676
Yeah. Heh.

1792
01:49:21.678 --> 01:49:23.378
Have you guys talked
to Martha?

1793
01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:25.880
Oh, I was texting her
this weekend.

1794
01:49:25.882 --> 01:49:28.353
Have you talked to her?

1795
01:49:29.353 --> 01:49:31.356
Hey. There she is.

1796
01:49:36.394 --> 01:49:39.531
Go get that girl,
Dr. Bravestone.

1797
01:49:47.106 --> 01:49:48.473
Hi.

1798
01:49:48.475 --> 01:49:50.642
- Hi.
- I really...

1799
01:49:50.644 --> 01:49:52.544
- I really wanted to call you.
- I get it.

1800
01:49:52.546 --> 01:49:54.478
Sorry, I don't know
why I didn't call.

1801
01:49:54.480 --> 01:49:55.813
It's weird being out and,

1802
01:49:55.815 --> 01:49:58.816
not, like, knowing,
like, what's going on and...

1803
01:50:02.623 --> 01:50:03.956
What?

1804
01:50:17.405 --> 01:50:18.874
Smoldering.
