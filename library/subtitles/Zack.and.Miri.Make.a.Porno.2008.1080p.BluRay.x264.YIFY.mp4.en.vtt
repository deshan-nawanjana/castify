WEBVTT

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:35.668
You little motherfucker!

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.019
Get up, Zack.

00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:16.057
Come on, I don't wanna be
late for work.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.385
Ahh! Get out!
- Jesus, fuck!

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:27.595
Close the door
if you're gonna take a shit.

00:01:27.762 --> 00:01:30.390
- It was closed.
- It was closed over, it was not closed.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:32.267
- Close the door, Zack!
- Okay, okay.

00:01:32.433 --> 00:01:34.394
God.
- Fine.

00:01:52.996 --> 00:01:55.248
- What's that thing?
- It's a hand warmer.

00:02:05.091 --> 00:02:06.509
We're going now.

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.648
- You smell that? Is that the car? Fuck.
- Oh, goddamn it.

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:22.859
- What? What?
- Oh, it's wedged in my taint.

00:02:23.026 --> 00:02:24.777
- What is?
- It got wedged in my taint.

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:27.780
- What?
- It's stuck under my balls.

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:30.783
- It's between my balls and my leg.
- What's happening?

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.288
- Please, pull over. Pull the fuck over!
- All right, all right! Jesus, all right!

00:02:35.455 --> 00:02:37.374
It's about to move up to my ass.
- What?

00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:39.126
The movement makes it hotter.

00:02:39.293 --> 00:02:42.254
It's tucked under them.
It's stuck under them.

00:02:53.057 --> 00:02:55.142
Oh, fuck.

00:03:07.655 --> 00:03:09.615
I think I burned my ball hair off.

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:15.579
It's not funny.

00:03:30.177 --> 00:03:32.513
Can you help me pick out an outfit
for tonight?

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.765
I'm working till 6.

00:03:37.226 --> 00:03:41.897
- Well, I can try stuff on at the store.
- The store?

00:03:42.064 --> 00:03:44.692
No, how about instead,
you get a friend?

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:46.402
But you are my friend.

00:03:46.568 --> 00:03:49.863
I mean a girl friend, jeez.

00:04:30.821 --> 00:04:34.074
Mr. Delaney,
can you work for me tomorrow?

00:04:34.241 --> 00:04:35.326
Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

00:04:35.492 --> 00:04:39.079
Then you must come in the next day,
I tell you.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:41.415
- It's Black Friday.
- Black Friday?

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:44.543
It's the biggest mall-shopping day
of the year.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.548
And since the mall is just up the street,
I would like you to come out and work.

00:04:49.715 --> 00:04:52.092
- On Black Friday.
- Oh, yeah.

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.678
All right, you want me to work
on Moolie Monday too?

00:04:54.845 --> 00:04:57.097
- I'm sorry?
- How about Nigga Tuesday?

00:04:57.264 --> 00:05:00.768
- Nigga Tuesday? Is this a new holiday?
- You come to a brother and tell him

00:05:00.934 --> 00:05:04.897
he gotta work on Black Friday. You
got any idea how racist that sounds?

00:05:05.064 --> 00:05:07.232
Telling me to work.
What, you think you own me?

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:10.486
- I never said this, I tell you.
- But you thought it, didn't you?

00:05:10.652 --> 00:05:11.695
You thought,

00:05:11.862 --> 00:05:14.531
"I'm gonna lay down the law
for this nigga, I put food on his table,

00:05:14.698 --> 00:05:17.618
clothes on his nigga baby backs,
and he ain't gonna say shit."

00:05:17.785 --> 00:05:19.411
- This ain't Amistad.
- You shut up.

00:05:19.578 --> 00:05:22.873
You goddamn right this ain't Amistad.
I can't wait till the post office

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.585
settles my disability suit because then
I'm gonna be out this motherfucker.

00:05:26.752 --> 00:05:29.004
I'm gonna be Oprah rich.
Y'all can kiss my ass.

00:05:29.171 --> 00:05:32.132
You know what? Fuck you.
Fuck you, and suck cock.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.428
- To hell with you.
- To hell with you.

00:05:36.595 --> 00:05:40.516
- Zachary will work. Zack, my boy.
- Yeah.

00:05:40.682 --> 00:05:43.185
- The customer with the harelip...
- Oh, yeah.

00:05:43.352 --> 00:05:48.148
- speak me, say you were playing
baseball here the other night.

00:05:48.315 --> 00:05:51.819
Wiffle ball.
And, uh, no, that wasn't me.

00:05:52.277 --> 00:05:54.822
Maybe the harelip
makes it sound like "baseball."

00:05:54.988 --> 00:05:56.657
Yeah, maybe you hear with an accent.

00:05:56.824 --> 00:05:58.659
- Fuck you, okay?
- Okay.

00:05:58.826 --> 00:06:02.329
One day, I'm gonna put a camera
over there, and then I can tell...

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:04.456
I'll know everything you do
when I'm gone.

00:06:04.623 --> 00:06:08.043
Everything. Scratch your balls,
take a shit, everything, I tell you, okay?

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.796
Okay. Fucker.

00:06:11.171 --> 00:06:16.844
I hate both of you ebony and ivory
motherfuckers, I tell you.

00:06:17.678 --> 00:06:23.308
- Why is he so fucking high-strung?
- "Fuck off, I tell you. Very good."

00:06:23.475 --> 00:06:26.687
Can you believe that Gandhi motherfucker,
telling me I gotta work on Black Friday?

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:27.855
Ain't that some shit?

00:06:28.021 --> 00:06:29.898
- Yeah.
- Like I don't wanna do shopping.

00:06:30.065 --> 00:06:33.694
Biggest sales day of the year. I'm
getting a flat-screen TV, believe that.

00:06:33.861 --> 00:06:37.448
That's my fault, I should tell you. I
asked for Friday morning off, I'm sorry.

00:06:37.614 --> 00:06:40.577
- For what?
- I actually need a lot of recovery time.

00:06:40.743 --> 00:06:43.204
Tonight is me and Miri's
ten-year high school reunion.

00:06:43.371 --> 00:06:46.124
I'm just gonna
get fucking alcohol poisoning.

00:06:46.291 --> 00:06:49.919
- Reunion? Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.
- Isn't that fucked up that they do that?

00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:52.672
They say it's the best chance
to get everyone together.

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:54.716
People come back in town
for the holidays.

00:06:54.883 --> 00:06:57.177
But they could have it
in the middle of the summer

00:06:57.343 --> 00:07:00.972
at a blowjob contest that I was judging,
and it would still be retarded.

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:04.601
- So why you going, then?
- Miri's making me go.

00:07:04.767 --> 00:07:07.228
Why you always
bending over backwards for that girl,

00:07:07.395 --> 00:07:10.523
- knowing she ain't giving up no ass?
- We got a good thing going.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.068
She pays half the rent, does dishes,
she wakes me up in the morning.

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:16.112
Why complicate that with sex?

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:18.615
Besides, man, I've known her
since the first grade.

00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:21.075
You don't fuck someone
you met in the first grade.

00:07:21.242 --> 00:07:23.244
Excuse me,
I met my wife in kindergarten.

00:07:23.411 --> 00:07:24.746
We got married senior year,

00:07:24.913 --> 00:07:27.415
and she has been the queen
of my world ever since.

00:07:27.582 --> 00:07:31.085
- What if you could do it all over again?
- I'd jerk off and live by myself.

00:07:31.252 --> 00:07:33.046
That woman is the bane
of my existence.

00:07:33.213 --> 00:07:37.175
- See?
- Excuse me, can I get a coffee, black?

00:07:37.342 --> 00:07:39.886
Can't you see we talking, white?

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:44.390
If you're gonna continue
to emasculate me

00:07:44.557 --> 00:07:46.935
with this Barbie dress-up shit,

00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:48.144
I'm using your laptop.

00:07:48.311 --> 00:07:50.730
Don't forget to smack it
when you turn it on,

00:07:50.897 --> 00:07:52.649
otherwise the screen
doesn't come on.

00:07:54.609 --> 00:07:56.361
Why don't you spring
and get a new one?

00:07:56.528 --> 00:07:59.364
Same reason I don't spring for clothes
for tonight, I'm broke.

00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:02.450
There's a chick who works
at Teen Juice at the mall, you know.

00:08:02.617 --> 00:08:04.118
I gave her a good deal on yarn,

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:06.788
- so she's letting me borrow this stuff.
- Yo, bro.

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:12.710
What?
- You're buying a vibrator online.

00:08:12.877 --> 00:08:15.547
- What's wrong with the one you have?
- It died last week.

00:08:15.713 --> 00:08:18.299
Look at the size
of those fucking panties.

00:08:18.466 --> 00:08:20.134
Shoot that shit. Shoot it.

00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.637
My God, who even knew
Amazon sold shit like this?

00:08:22.804 --> 00:08:24.055
This is incredible.

00:08:24.222 --> 00:08:27.308
- Those are fucking granny panties.
- Okay,

00:08:27.475 --> 00:08:31.020
A, I don't appreciate you violating the
sanctity of my Amazon Wish List page,

00:08:31.187 --> 00:08:33.273
and B, I'm not buying that thing
from Amazon,

00:08:33.439 --> 00:08:36.609
because it turns out
I don't have a credit card they take.

00:08:42.574 --> 00:08:46.327
- Oh, shit.
- I'm sorry, guys. Am I in the way?

00:08:46.703 --> 00:08:49.497
You're a fucking faggot, all right?
Let's go to Starbucks.

00:08:49.998 --> 00:08:54.002
- He's a shitty barista anyways.
- Cock.

00:08:56.337 --> 00:08:59.507
- And he throws like a bitch.
- You know what else I throw?

00:08:59.674 --> 00:09:02.427
My nut sack in your coffees,
so how did that taste, fucker?

00:09:02.594 --> 00:09:05.513
We saw your girlfriend
in her underwear, cunt nugget.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.975
Well, too bad she's not my girlfriend,
you little fuck... Oh, they're gone.

00:09:09.142 --> 00:09:10.810
Are you still talking to me?

00:09:10.977 --> 00:09:15.565
Uh, just said, I'm gonna
look up more fuck toys on Amazon.

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.192
Oh, holy shit.

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:21.446
- They sell the Fleshlight here too.
- What's that?

00:09:21.613 --> 00:09:24.365
It's a fucking pocket pussy
that is shaped like a flashlight

00:09:24.532 --> 00:09:26.034
"for discretionary jacking off."

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.620
That way if you get caught,
no one thinks it's weird.

00:09:28.786 --> 00:09:31.372
You're just a guy who likes to fuck
his flashlight.

00:09:31.539 --> 00:09:33.166
I am totally buying this shit.

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:36.878
Whoa, if you've got money to burn,
how about paying the electric bill?

00:09:37.045 --> 00:09:39.881
- That's due already?
- November's is probably due now,

00:09:40.048 --> 00:09:43.885
but I was talking about September's.
Tell me this doesn't rock.

00:09:45.970 --> 00:09:47.847
You kind of look
like Ronald McDonald.

00:09:48.014 --> 00:09:49.724
That makes me want
some McNuggets.

00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:53.269
Why would you wanna buy a
pocket pussy anyway? That is so sad.

00:09:53.436 --> 00:09:55.730
What? Excuse me,
I forgot about the nobility

00:09:55.897 --> 00:09:58.566
that accompanies coming
with a fucking vibrator.

00:09:58.733 --> 00:10:02.403
Think a kid in Darfur gets saved every
time a vibrator makes you come? No.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.489
- "Real feel action"? Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

00:10:04.656 --> 00:10:06.824
If you start fucking machines,
I'm moving out.

00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:09.202
What do you think a vibrator is?
It's a machine.

00:10:09.369 --> 00:10:11.829
How come you get
to fuck something with a motor in it?

00:10:11.996 --> 00:10:14.916
I've never met a man who can
make me come like a vibrator does.

00:10:15.083 --> 00:10:18.419
That's bullshit. You get to be Buck
Rogers having sex in the 25th century

00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:20.505
with fucking Twiki and Dr. Theopolis.

00:10:20.672 --> 00:10:23.007
I'm stuck to a bottle of Jergens
in the bathroom.

00:10:23.174 --> 00:10:28.221
Holy bejesus. You do not use
my Jergens to jack it in our bathroom.

00:10:28.388 --> 00:10:31.265
No, you know what I do
actually, is I light a bunch of candles

00:10:31.432 --> 00:10:34.936
and I sprawl out on my sheets
and I listen to Sting.

00:10:35.103 --> 00:10:38.481
No, I'm a guy. Give me
two Popsicle sticks and a rubber band,

00:10:38.648 --> 00:10:41.610
I'll find a way to fuck it,
like a filthy MacGyver.

00:10:41.777 --> 00:10:46.073
Oh, my God, I'm so glad I'm not a guy.
How about this?

00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:49.118
I don't get why you're putting
so much effort into this thing.

00:10:49.284 --> 00:10:54.081
I thought we were just gonna go to
sit around and make fun of everybody.

00:10:54.248 --> 00:10:58.460
I can't wear anything that I already own
and expect to bring home Bobby Long.

00:10:58.627 --> 00:11:04.049
Bobby fucking Long? No way.
Didn't that guy call you "Stinky Linky"?

00:11:04.216 --> 00:11:05.426
Yeah, that was then, okay?

00:11:05.592 --> 00:11:08.262
Maybe now he can save me a fortune
in Amazon bills.

00:11:08.429 --> 00:11:11.473
Maybe you can fuck our landlord

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.726
so we can at least keep a roof
over our heads.

00:11:14.393 --> 00:11:17.813
You don't have the rent?
Zack, it's your month.

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.649
Hey, I bought skates
with last week's paycheck

00:11:20.816 --> 00:11:23.318
and I need those to skate with.

00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:27.614
And this week's will barely cover
the past two water bills, so...

00:11:27.781 --> 00:11:29.366
Is this sexy?

00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:33.328
Yeah, in like a To Catch a Predator
kind of way, it is pretty fucking sexy.

00:11:34.496 --> 00:11:35.914
Then we're done.

00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:40.127
What the fuck? Zack.

00:11:40.586 --> 00:11:43.422
- You want me to come in?
- What happened to the water?

00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:50.512
- They shut it off.
- Oh, shit. Just...

00:11:50.679 --> 00:11:54.558
Help me get this shit out of my hair.
Just use the water out of the toilet.

00:11:57.186 --> 00:11:59.188
- There's poo in there.
- Not that part.

00:11:59.354 --> 00:12:01.899
- The back part of the toilet thing.
- Oh, that makes sense.

00:12:02.065 --> 00:12:05.277
Take the cup there
and then scoop it in, there you go.

00:12:05.444 --> 00:12:09.323
Here, I'll lean back and you can just,
you know, pour it down like... Like that.

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.074
You're harshing my buzz, you know.

00:12:11.241 --> 00:12:13.160
This is so lame.
Don't look. Don't look.

00:12:13.327 --> 00:12:14.870
Don't look.

00:12:15.204 --> 00:12:16.371
Whoa!

00:12:28.175 --> 00:12:30.511
All right, one hour tops,
then we're gone.

00:12:30.677 --> 00:12:31.720
Or I had an idea.

00:12:31.887 --> 00:12:34.348
We could just not go at all,
which would rock.

00:12:35.224 --> 00:12:38.227
Even though we're broke
and we've never amounted to anything,

00:12:38.393 --> 00:12:40.395
we're still better than these people,
right?

00:12:40.562 --> 00:12:45.108
No. Not at all. We're probably
not even as good as most of them,

00:12:45.275 --> 00:12:47.653
unless one of them is a crackhead
or something.

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:50.614
Just tell me I'm prettier
than when we graduated.

00:12:51.406 --> 00:12:53.116
You look about the same.

00:12:53.283 --> 00:12:56.411
Definitely not prettier,
but around the same.

00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:58.580
I'm thinner, though, right?
A little?

00:12:59.665 --> 00:13:00.749
Not really.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.586
Well, good pep talk. Fuck.

00:13:15.264 --> 00:13:17.933
- Ta-da.
- Ta-da.

00:13:21.353 --> 00:13:24.231
- You don't recognize us, do you?
- Um, no, sorry.

00:13:24.398 --> 00:13:26.191
Zack Brown, Miri Linky.

00:13:26.608 --> 00:13:28.527
Were you the one they called
Stinky Linky?

00:13:28.694 --> 00:13:31.446
Oh, no, no one ever called me that.

00:13:32.865 --> 00:13:35.409
- Great. What does yours say?
- What the fuck? Come on.

00:13:35.576 --> 00:13:39.121
- I'm sure I had a nickname. Nothing?
- All right, you have a great time,

00:13:39.288 --> 00:13:43.584
and before you go, don't forget
your copy of The Roving Roe-Ver.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:45.294
What the fuck's this shit?

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.463
That is not shit, that would be
our bi-monthly newsletter.

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.048
- Awesome.
- It updates you

00:13:50.215 --> 00:13:52.885
- on what everyone's doing.
- Finally.

00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:56.930
I love your enthusiasm. Here you go.
Write your e-mail address on that

00:13:57.097 --> 00:14:00.893
and I'll be sure to add you
to our 800-member-strong mailing list.

00:14:01.059 --> 00:14:03.061
We had 800 people
in our graduating class?

00:14:03.228 --> 00:14:07.900
Yes, and only 250 R.S.V.P.'d.
Doesn't that suck, Mary?

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.402
- Miri.
- You married, Bets?

00:14:10.569 --> 00:14:13.488
- I am. Two kids.
- Wow, that's beautiful.

00:14:13.655 --> 00:14:15.782
- Awesome.
- You wanna fuck me later?

00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:19.036
- Uh, no, I'm married.
- Okay, cool. If you change your mind,

00:14:19.202 --> 00:14:21.413
- I'll be in there getting shitfaced.
- He will.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:23.790
- Just so you know, I eat the pussy.
- He does.

00:14:23.957 --> 00:14:26.251
Ah, tempting. Again, no.

00:14:26.418 --> 00:14:29.671
- Shall we?
- Sir. Bye, Bets.

00:14:30.339 --> 00:14:32.341
Think about it.

00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:20.181
Enjoy.

00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:24.143
Can I get two beers, please?
You want a beer?

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.562
- Yeah.
- Three beers.

00:15:27.063 --> 00:15:29.148
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

00:15:29.315 --> 00:15:35.363
Is that Zack? Or am I Zack?

00:15:37.365 --> 00:15:39.867
- Never gets old, huh?
- The other Zack.

00:15:40.034 --> 00:15:43.579
Oh, in my world,
nobody calls me "the other Zack,"

00:15:43.746 --> 00:15:47.208
now that this guy's not around
anymore, huh?

00:15:47.375 --> 00:15:52.380
- Get the fuck off of me.
- There can be only one.

00:15:53.006 --> 00:15:56.217
- What?
- Highlander, man? The Kurgan.

00:15:56.384 --> 00:16:00.263
Remember? I'd yell it at you whenever
we passed each other in the hallway?

00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.057
Like it was yesterday, man.
Awesome. Awesome.

00:16:03.224 --> 00:16:06.894
Awesome. God, you guys have
so much to catch up on. Whoo.

00:16:07.061 --> 00:16:08.938
- No.
- I'm gonna let you get to it.

00:16:09.105 --> 00:16:10.606
Bitch.

00:16:15.278 --> 00:16:18.531
Have you seen that big blowup picture
they have of me?

00:16:18.698 --> 00:16:19.741
Yeah, it's...

00:16:20.616 --> 00:16:23.953
My hair is terrible. I can't believe
I even wore my hair like that.

00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:26.998
That's before I knew
about styling products, you know.

00:16:27.165 --> 00:16:31.711
It makes a big difference in life.
But you live and learn, though, right?

00:16:31.878 --> 00:16:36.466
I mean, ten years ago, Pittsburgh,
who knew anything about fashion?

00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:42.221
Back in the day, our hairstyle, oh...

00:16:43.681 --> 00:16:44.807
Hey, stranger.

00:16:46.309 --> 00:16:51.397
- Whoa. Stinky Linky.
- Yeah. Although it's just Miri now.

00:16:51.564 --> 00:16:53.775
- Give me a hug.
- Oh, okay.

00:16:53.941 --> 00:16:56.694
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:16:58.988 --> 00:17:00.990
- How have you been?
- Great, great.

00:17:01.157 --> 00:17:02.658
- Yeah?
- You look fantastic.

00:17:02.825 --> 00:17:07.163
Wow, that is not something that you
would have said to me ten years ago.

00:17:07.330 --> 00:17:11.084
- Well, I've grown up.
- Yes. Yes, you have.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:13.878
You just look...

00:17:14.587 --> 00:17:17.173
Ooh, heh, heh.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:22.178
- Well, listen to you. Thank you.
- No, don't thank me, just fuck me.

00:17:36.067 --> 00:17:38.027
Roxanne. Hey.

00:17:38.194 --> 00:17:41.280
Someone I like, what are the odds,
huh?

00:17:43.699 --> 00:17:45.952
Zack Brown, we had four years
of Spanish together.

00:17:46.119 --> 00:17:47.453
Why does no one recognize me?

00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:50.039
- Am I thinner? Is that it?
- Look at him.

00:17:51.249 --> 00:17:53.668
- Who?
- My stupid husband.

00:17:53.835 --> 00:17:58.297
No fucking shit. John Butterfield?
You actually married John Butterfield?

00:17:58.464 --> 00:18:00.716
- That's amazing.
- Don't ever get married.

00:18:00.883 --> 00:18:04.595
It sucks. You stop appreciating each
other and run out of shit to talk about

00:18:04.762 --> 00:18:09.225
after the first year.
But look at him now, chatty as fuck.

00:18:09.392 --> 00:18:12.728
Flirting up a storm with that
cheerleader nimrod Monica Von.

00:18:13.563 --> 00:18:17.733
You want me to maybe flirt with you
so he can see it, even it up a bit?

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:18.985
I don't wanna get even.

00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:23.447
If I was gonna do anything,
I'd wanna one-up the asshole.

00:18:25.199 --> 00:18:27.743
You can give me a handjob
in the girls' locker room.

00:18:32.874 --> 00:18:34.792
- Fine, but make it fast.
- Fuck, yeah.

00:18:34.959 --> 00:18:37.503
Are you staying in town
for a while or...?

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.381
Just tonight. I fly back
to L.A. tomorrow.

00:18:40.715 --> 00:18:46.263
L.A., wow, Los Angeles. Gosh,
Bobby Long, coming up in the world.

00:18:46.763 --> 00:18:52.686
- With Mrs. Long, I bet, huh?
- No, no, no. No Mrs. Long for me.

00:18:53.145 --> 00:18:56.273
- Then can I be honest with you?
- Sure.

00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:57.774
Um...

00:19:00.194 --> 00:19:01.737
Whew. I think I need a drink.

00:19:01.904 --> 00:19:04.573
Do you need a drink?
Because I need a drink to say this.

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:08.118
- I've got a beer already, so...
- Oh, great, thank you.

00:19:08.577 --> 00:19:10.871
I think there's a
cigarette butt in there.

00:19:11.038 --> 00:19:12.080
Yup.

00:19:16.001 --> 00:19:18.086
Sorry about the elbow.

00:19:21.632 --> 00:19:24.718
There can be only one.

00:19:26.762 --> 00:19:28.889
Can I get a beer, please?

00:19:30.724 --> 00:19:33.518
Thank you very much.

00:19:34.144 --> 00:19:36.897
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:19:37.064 --> 00:19:40.317
My friend's making an ass of herself
hitting on her high school crush.

00:19:40.484 --> 00:19:42.361
Oh, God, that's so sad.

00:19:42.527 --> 00:19:45.322
It's so Miri, is what it is.
I'm Zack, by the way.

00:19:45.489 --> 00:19:47.241
Brandon.

00:19:48.825 --> 00:19:51.328
Don't worry, we weren't
in the same class or anything.

00:19:51.495 --> 00:19:55.749
- Okay. Lucky you.
- Are you a Monroe-ver?

00:19:55.916 --> 00:19:59.169
Well, I went here,
let's just leave it at that, I guess.

00:19:59.336 --> 00:20:02.381
Do you have one of the large
blown-up pictures of your younger self

00:20:02.547 --> 00:20:05.425
- hanging around here?
- I do, kind of. Right there.

00:20:08.136 --> 00:20:10.347
Gorgeous.
- Good times.

00:20:10.514 --> 00:20:12.849
What do you do?
What brings you here?

00:20:13.016 --> 00:20:15.102
I came with somebody
who went to school here.

00:20:15.269 --> 00:20:16.436
- Really?
- Bobby Long.

00:20:16.603 --> 00:20:19.856
No shit. That's who my friend's hitting
on right now. See right there?

00:20:20.023 --> 00:20:22.734
- Really.
- One dressed like Hannah Montana?

00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.196
In L.A., we call that look
"Nickelodeon chic."

00:20:26.363 --> 00:20:28.699
- Wait, L. A.? Los Angeles?
- California.

00:20:28.865 --> 00:20:31.034
That's awesome, man.
What do you do out there?

00:20:31.201 --> 00:20:35.163
- I'm an actor.
- Wow, that's really impressive.

00:20:35.330 --> 00:20:37.708
- Thank you, thank you.
- In fucking movies?

00:20:37.874 --> 00:20:40.502
"Fucking movies." Pretty much.

00:20:40.669 --> 00:20:43.547
Look at you. What...?
Anything I've seen? What movies?

00:20:43.714 --> 00:20:45.716
Oh, all sorts of movies
with all-male casts.

00:20:45.882 --> 00:20:49.303
All-male casts.
Like Glengarry Glen Ross? Like that?

00:20:49.636 --> 00:20:53.265
Like Glen and Gary
Suck Ross, Meaty Cock

00:20:53.432 --> 00:20:56.893
and Drop Their Hairy Nuts
in His Eager Mouth.

00:20:58.895 --> 00:21:02.524
- Is that like a sequel?
- Sort of.

00:21:02.691 --> 00:21:06.236
- It's a re-imagining.
- Oh, like The Wiz.

00:21:06.403 --> 00:21:10.574
More erotic and with less women.

00:21:10.741 --> 00:21:13.243
No women, to be exact.

00:21:14.911 --> 00:21:19.583
I apologize in advance
if I am out of line here,

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:21.585
but are you in gay porn?

00:21:21.752 --> 00:21:24.254
- Guilty as charged.
- Are you fucking with me?

00:21:24.421 --> 00:21:27.591
- I thought you recognized me, that's...
- Oh, okay, I get it.

00:21:27.758 --> 00:21:30.093
You're not in my demographic,
so I'm not insulted.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:33.597
- Not really. Who's your demographic?
- Do you love pussy?

00:21:33.764 --> 00:21:35.515
- I do.
- Then not you.

00:21:35.682 --> 00:21:36.850
Oh, okay.

00:21:37.017 --> 00:21:39.227
I came here tonight

00:21:39.394 --> 00:21:42.439
hoping to seduce you
and bring you back to my apartment

00:21:42.606 --> 00:21:45.609
and sleep with you to, uh,
get back at you,

00:21:45.776 --> 00:21:50.072
you know, for calling me Stinky Linky
all those years ago.

00:21:51.448 --> 00:21:53.575
That is a weird revenge plot.

00:21:53.742 --> 00:21:56.536
- You must be a terrible lay for that.
- What? No, I'm great.

00:21:56.703 --> 00:21:59.289
I mean, I've had enough practice
and everything. That...

00:21:59.456 --> 00:22:02.959
Wow, that sounded not good.

00:22:03.126 --> 00:22:08.131
I fuck a lot. That's what I meant to say.
That doesn't sound good either.

00:22:08.298 --> 00:22:11.051
You're a lot funnier than I remember.

00:22:11.718 --> 00:22:16.640
Thank you. Gosh,
you turned out to be such a nice guy.

00:22:18.308 --> 00:22:22.896
It just... You know, it makes it even
easier to just... To just say this.

00:22:23.063 --> 00:22:27.651
Would you like to come back to my
place and maybe open a bottle of wine

00:22:27.818 --> 00:22:31.154
and have ourselves
a real high school reunion?

00:22:31.863 --> 00:22:33.448
- I...
- Hello, Miriam.

00:22:33.615 --> 00:22:34.699
Beat it, we're talking.

00:22:34.866 --> 00:22:37.994
- I wanted to introduce you to Brandon.
- Salutations.

00:22:38.161 --> 00:22:40.330
- Bobby's boyfriend.
- Bobby who?

00:22:40.497 --> 00:22:43.291
- Bobby me.
- Bobby Long.

00:22:44.251 --> 00:22:50.174
Brandon is the star of such adult fare
as... What was that one called again?

00:22:50.842 --> 00:22:53.136
You Better Shut Your Mouth
or I'm Gonna Fuck It.

00:22:53.302 --> 00:22:56.347
That's right.
I'm surprised I forgot that.

00:22:56.597 --> 00:22:58.015
Are you fucking with me?

00:22:58.182 --> 00:23:00.518
No, they're fucking with each other.

00:23:00.935 --> 00:23:02.019
Oh, my God.

00:23:03.688 --> 00:23:05.690
- No.
- What?

00:23:06.983 --> 00:23:08.359
Granny Panties?

00:23:08.526 --> 00:23:10.194
- Excuse me?
- How can you tell?

00:23:10.611 --> 00:23:11.737
This is so crazy.

00:23:11.904 --> 00:23:14.991
I was literally just watching you, like,
right before we got here.

00:23:15.158 --> 00:23:18.035
This is so crazy. This is you, right?

00:23:18.202 --> 00:23:19.537
My name's Granny Panties,

00:23:19.704 --> 00:23:21.998
and nobody wants to fuck me.

00:23:22.165 --> 00:23:24.709
Nothing's whiter than my big gay ass...

00:23:24.876 --> 00:23:25.877
Where'd you get that?

00:23:26.043 --> 00:23:28.546
Oh, I entered "gay" and "ass,"
and it was the top hit.

00:23:28.713 --> 00:23:33.551
It's had 200,000 views in three hours.
Honey, you are, like...

00:23:33.718 --> 00:23:36.387
I'm jealous right now
because you're, like, super famous.

00:23:36.554 --> 00:23:40.057
Baby, please take our picture.
I get a picture with Granny Panties.

00:23:40.224 --> 00:23:42.393
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This is awesome.

00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:45.271
- All right, smile. Okay, got it.
- Did you get it?

00:23:45.438 --> 00:23:47.690
- Oh, thank you very much.
- E-mail me that.

00:23:47.857 --> 00:23:50.401
Oh, because he's the worst
photographer. Okay, good.

00:23:50.568 --> 00:23:52.737
- You're gay?
- Yeah.

00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:56.866
And I'm on the Internet
wearing a diaper?

00:23:57.033 --> 00:23:59.744
Who knew you'd come to Pittsburgh
and meet a celebrity?

00:24:00.745 --> 00:24:02.705
I'm gonna binge-drink now
until I pass out.

00:24:02.872 --> 00:24:07.001
Okay. She'll be fine. So you guys
suck each other's cocks, huh?

00:24:07.168 --> 00:24:08.586
Oh, like crazy.

00:24:10.421 --> 00:24:12.632
Okay, that's enough, I think.

00:24:12.798 --> 00:24:14.800
I'm embarrassing him.
I love when he's embarrassed.

00:24:14.967 --> 00:24:17.428
He's not living out loud,
so he gets all like, ooh.

00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:20.681
- You are totally in love, aren't you?
- Zachary, we are.

00:24:20.848 --> 00:24:22.016
Wow, I...

00:24:22.183 --> 00:24:23.935
Oh, God, I just wanna eat him up,
yum, yum.

00:24:24.101 --> 00:24:25.853
Save some for me, yum, yum, yum.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.731
- I can't keep my hands off him.
- You've had one too many.

00:24:28.898 --> 00:24:32.568
Although he does most of the eating in
the sack. In the sack and of the sack.

00:24:32.985 --> 00:24:35.613
All right, that's enough.
Look, you've drunk too much.

00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:38.866
You do this every time. You get too
Mary for everybody in the room

00:24:39.033 --> 00:24:41.619
- and you can't contain yourself.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:24:41.786 --> 00:24:45.957
And by containing myself, do you
mean containing myself in a closet?

00:24:46.123 --> 00:24:48.793
In a closet of denial? Is that...?
No, no, no.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.711
Holy shit, this just got real.

00:24:50.878 --> 00:24:52.964
This is exactly why
you haven't met my mother.

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.633
You don't know how to ease people
into this situation.

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.762
- You just force your way in every time.
- I thought, maybe for one second

00:24:59.929 --> 00:25:03.182
in this godforsaken town,
I could be myself. I'm so sorry.

00:25:03.349 --> 00:25:05.476
No, you're right, I should just butch up

00:25:05.643 --> 00:25:10.898
and pretend that I don't love it when
you shove your dick in my mouth.

00:25:11.065 --> 00:25:14.151
- This is the best night of my life.
- Am I making a spectacle?

00:25:14.318 --> 00:25:16.779
- I could make a much bigger scene.
- You really are.

00:25:16.946 --> 00:25:20.283
I'm sorry. Pittsburgh.
Listen up, Monroe-vers.

00:25:20.449 --> 00:25:24.912
My name is Brandon St. Randy,
and I love Bobby Long.

00:25:25.079 --> 00:25:26.622
- Fucking A.
- Is that enough?

00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:29.667
Is that enough of a scene?
I could start doing worse than that.

00:25:29.834 --> 00:25:32.253
The reason you haven't taken me
to your mother's...

00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:36.007
Your mother with her makeup and
all her drinking, she's in the closet too.

00:25:36.173 --> 00:25:39.760
- They fight just like real people.
- I thought I'd be a conduit for you...

00:25:39.927 --> 00:25:41.012
Thank you.

00:25:41.178 --> 00:25:44.015
- Are you being sarcastic?
- No, I'm not.

00:25:44.682 --> 00:25:47.310
- Thank you.
- I love you.

00:25:48.185 --> 00:25:50.646
- I'll e-mail you.
- Zack, it was so nice to meet you.

00:25:50.813 --> 00:25:54.066
And I will be patient with you.
I will be there on your journey.

00:25:54.233 --> 00:25:57.987
I will be your Sherpa
up the mountain of gayness.

00:26:25.014 --> 00:26:29.935
Well, might as well see how many hits
Granny Panties is up to, huh?

00:26:33.773 --> 00:26:35.566
Did I do that?

00:26:43.157 --> 00:26:45.076
Thanks, George.

00:26:46.577 --> 00:26:49.956
What kind of evil fucks
turn off your power the day...?

00:26:50.123 --> 00:26:55.212
No, the night before Thanksgiving?
Who does that?

00:26:55.379 --> 00:26:57.047
Can you get an advance on your card?

00:26:57.214 --> 00:27:02.094
Fleshlight maxed-out my $200 limit.
Not a wise purchase, I'll give you that.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:06.264
This is bad. If we don't come up
with rent, we're gonna get locked out.

00:27:06.431 --> 00:27:09.184
Who the fuck wants to live there?
There's no water or power.

00:27:09.351 --> 00:27:12.771
Which means by the time
we get home, there's no heat either.

00:27:13.772 --> 00:27:17.526
Well, I think it's time we put what
we always talked about into effect.

00:27:18.193 --> 00:27:20.904
- You're gonna have to start hooking.
- You know, you jest,

00:27:21.071 --> 00:27:23.949
but these are the exact circumstances
people find themselves in

00:27:24.116 --> 00:27:26.535
right before
they start having sex for money.

00:27:26.702 --> 00:27:29.413
- Yeah.
- Or making porn.

00:27:43.385 --> 00:27:46.221
Oh, my God, yeah.
- What? You got an idea?

00:27:46.388 --> 00:27:47.806
We could make a porno.

00:27:48.223 --> 00:27:50.142
- Not the idea I was looking for.
- What?

00:27:50.308 --> 00:27:53.937
No, that is a fucking awesome idea.
Are you shitting me? That's a rad idea.

00:27:54.104 --> 00:27:58.024
That guy, Brandon St. Randy, who's
Bobby Long's awesome nice boyfriend,

00:27:58.191 --> 00:27:59.985
he said he makes
a hundred grand a year

00:28:00.152 --> 00:28:03.780
because he shoots and distributes
his own porno flicks.

00:28:03.947 --> 00:28:06.241
If it's so easy,
how come everybody doesn't do it?

00:28:06.408 --> 00:28:09.703
Because other people have options
and dignity, which we do not have,

00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.956
which puts us in an amazingly
advantageous position.

00:28:13.123 --> 00:28:14.624
Fuck you, I have dignity.

00:28:14.791 --> 00:28:17.002
Where? Is it hidden
in your gigantic underpants

00:28:17.169 --> 00:28:20.756
that are plastered all over the Internet?
Is that where you hide your dignity?

00:28:20.922 --> 00:28:24.843
Every woman has a pair of those
period panties. That's, like, a fact.

00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:26.011
Okay. Families.

00:28:26.178 --> 00:28:28.972
I bet people don't make porno,
because they have families.

00:28:29.139 --> 00:28:34.019
But luckily, your parents are dead.
Sorry. My grandparents are dead.

00:28:34.186 --> 00:28:35.896
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

00:28:36.062 --> 00:28:39.441
So who are we gonna disappoint?
Porn has gone mainstream now.

00:28:39.608 --> 00:28:44.154
It's like Coca-Cola or Pepsi with dicks
in it. Look at Paris Hilton.

00:28:44.321 --> 00:28:46.531
She throat-fucks a guy in night vision,

00:28:46.698 --> 00:28:48.950
now she's selling fragrances
to tweens.

00:28:49.117 --> 00:28:51.328
And I'm pretty sure
she's legally retarded.

00:28:51.495 --> 00:28:52.537
That's for tweens?

00:28:52.704 --> 00:28:55.457
Have you seen that Joe Francis guy
who made Girls Gone Wild?

00:28:55.624 --> 00:28:58.543
That guy is the biggest fucking idiot
piece of shit in the world

00:28:58.710 --> 00:29:00.879
and he has a jet and a fucking island.

00:29:01.046 --> 00:29:05.967
Look, there's got to be a less extreme
solution to our financial woes here.

00:29:06.134 --> 00:29:08.720
- Give me a better option.
- Get a paper route.

00:29:08.887 --> 00:29:10.680
- I don't have a bike.
- Be a waiter.

00:29:10.847 --> 00:29:14.518
No one wants me around their food.
Would you eat food that I gave you?

00:29:14.684 --> 00:29:17.062
I would not eat food that you gave me,
that's true.

00:29:17.229 --> 00:29:19.564
I mean, nobody
wants to see us fuck, Zack.

00:29:19.731 --> 00:29:23.360
Everybody wants to see
anybody fuck. I hate Rosie O'Donnell,

00:29:23.527 --> 00:29:27.072
but if someone said, "I got a tape of
Rosie O'Donnell getting fucked stupid,"

00:29:27.239 --> 00:29:29.908
I'd be like, "Why aren't we
watching that right now?"

00:29:30.075 --> 00:29:31.368
Because she's famous. Hello.

00:29:31.535 --> 00:29:33.620
So are you.
You're fucking Granny Panties.

00:29:33.787 --> 00:29:37.249
My underwear and your ass
are famous, we're not.

00:29:37.415 --> 00:29:39.918
So who the F
would wanna watch us fuck?

00:29:40.085 --> 00:29:42.838
- At least 800 people.
- The jerks we went to school with?

00:29:43.004 --> 00:29:44.714
- Are you serious?
- Of course.

00:29:44.881 --> 00:29:46.842
If you heard
that someone we graduated with

00:29:47.008 --> 00:29:49.427
was in a fucking porno movie,
you'd watch it, right?

00:29:49.594 --> 00:29:52.097
I'd watch that guy Brandon
suck a cock, I just met him.

00:29:52.264 --> 00:29:54.850
With this mailing list,
we have almost a thousand people

00:29:55.016 --> 00:29:57.811
that would definitely buy a porno
we were in just to be like,

00:29:57.978 --> 00:30:01.273
"Hey, I sat next to that guy in Civics.
Look at his fucking dick."

00:30:01.439 --> 00:30:05.944
We sell a thousand copies at 20 bucks
a pop, bam, we have paid off our bills.

00:30:06.987 --> 00:30:10.949
So, what do you think?
- I don't think I wanna fuck a stranger.

00:30:11.116 --> 00:30:13.618
Oh, wow,
like you've never done that before.

00:30:13.785 --> 00:30:17.247
How many guys have you met in a bar,
taken home,

00:30:17.414 --> 00:30:21.084
banged with your mouth
and then never talked to again?

00:30:21.251 --> 00:30:22.752
That's what we call a stranger.

00:30:22.919 --> 00:30:26.965
Dude, I don't one-night mouth-fuck
anybody that I pick up in bars.

00:30:27.132 --> 00:30:32.178
You don't wanna fuck a stranger in the
porno movie for some weird reason.

00:30:32.554 --> 00:30:33.638
I guess...

00:30:36.766 --> 00:30:37.809
We could fuck.

00:30:38.852 --> 00:30:40.812
- Ew.
- Fuck you.

00:30:40.979 --> 00:30:44.149
I mean, you're a nice-enough-looking
guy and everything...

00:30:44.316 --> 00:30:47.193
Holy fuck, thank you.
You're an all-right-enough-looking girl.

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:49.487
- How does that feel?
- Dude, I'm just saying

00:30:49.654 --> 00:30:52.366
it'd be weird and wrong, you know,
like fucking my brother.

00:30:52.533 --> 00:30:55.286
Okay, seriously,
we're just talking about sex, okay?

00:30:55.453 --> 00:30:59.832
It's for a purpose. It's for getting rich.
Only my dick and your pussy

00:30:59.999 --> 00:31:03.836
would be doing something weird.
Our bodies and brains would be acting.

00:31:04.378 --> 00:31:07.340
- Wow.
- Just explain to your private beforehand,

00:31:07.506 --> 00:31:10.676
"Look, this doesn't mean anything.
We're just doing this for cash."

00:31:11.344 --> 00:31:13.679
- Oh, my God.
- What?

00:31:13.846 --> 00:31:17.642
You're just doing this because you've
always wanted to fuck me, aren't you?

00:31:18.392 --> 00:31:23.522
Yes. I've gone my whole life pretending
that I want nothing to do with you,

00:31:23.689 --> 00:31:26.984
just hoping one day
we'd be in such dire financial straits

00:31:27.151 --> 00:31:30.696
that I could use it
to finally make my move on you.

00:31:34.283 --> 00:31:36.535
You're just being sarcastic.
- I am.

00:31:36.702 --> 00:31:39.372
See, I was pretending to cry
right there.

00:31:40.373 --> 00:31:43.376
I guess it's not like it'd be creepy,

00:31:43.542 --> 00:31:47.463
like if we got way too drunk one night
and accidentally fucked, you know?

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:52.218
No. We'd be going in
with the understanding that it's...

00:31:52.385 --> 00:31:53.719
A business decision.

00:31:53.886 --> 00:31:56.472
Strictly a business decision.
It's a means to an end.

00:31:56.639 --> 00:31:58.057
- Right.
- And by end,

00:31:58.224 --> 00:32:00.393
I mean, I'll be waxing your ass.

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:03.562
Fuck you.
I'm not even letting you see my ass.

00:32:03.729 --> 00:32:07.566
I've seen your ass and the rest of you
naked around a billion times already.

00:32:07.733 --> 00:32:10.403
- That goes both ways, buddy.
- You've never seen my dick.

00:32:10.569 --> 00:32:12.905
Have you seen my dick?
You've never seen my dick.

00:32:13.072 --> 00:32:16.117
Are you kidding? That party we went to
where you got blasted,

00:32:16.283 --> 00:32:18.411
and Houls dared you
to give yourself head,

00:32:18.577 --> 00:32:20.871
and we all watched you try for,
like, an hour.

00:32:21.038 --> 00:32:25.835
Oh, yeah. Thanks by the way, for
fucking letting me do that. Thank you.

00:32:26.002 --> 00:32:28.421
Oh, God. We really do know too much
about each other.

00:32:28.587 --> 00:32:32.216
See, and this would really
just be one more thing.

00:32:32.383 --> 00:32:36.220
I mean, look at us. It's Thanksgiving
and we're huddled around a flaming

00:32:36.387 --> 00:32:38.764
fucking garbage can
like a couple of steno bums.

00:32:38.931 --> 00:32:42.935
I mean, this could give us a chance
to pay off our debt, pay our bills,

00:32:43.102 --> 00:32:47.023
get a fucking nicer apartment
with heat in it maybe.

00:32:49.859 --> 00:32:51.527
What are you doing?

00:32:53.112 --> 00:32:58.200
Miriam Linky, will you have sex
with me on camera for money?

00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:07.168
I will.

00:33:08.127 --> 00:33:09.462
A producer?
- Yeah.

00:33:09.628 --> 00:33:13.591
- Guy who gets to finance the movie.
- You think I got that kind of money?

00:33:13.758 --> 00:33:16.761
We just need that. What you're about
to spend on the flat screen.

00:33:16.927 --> 00:33:18.971
Now I can't get my flat screen?
Fuck that.

00:33:19.138 --> 00:33:23.059
No, no, no. With your cut of the profits,
you're gonna get two flat screens.

00:33:23.225 --> 00:33:25.478
One in your living room,
one in your bathroom.

00:33:25.644 --> 00:33:27.438
One in the bathroom?

00:33:28.022 --> 00:33:30.941
You know, it's always been my dream
to watch shit while I shit.

00:33:31.108 --> 00:33:33.736
Everyone with an ass
loves to watch shit while they shit.

00:33:33.903 --> 00:33:36.989
- I'm gonna make that happen for you.
- I don't know, man.

00:33:37.156 --> 00:33:38.616
What else the producer do?

00:33:38.866 --> 00:33:42.661
- Um, they help with the casting.
- What's casting?

00:33:42.828 --> 00:33:44.663
Finding the people to be in the movie.

00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:46.624
- I get to help pick the women?
- Yeah.

00:33:46.791 --> 00:33:50.169
Like, I can look at a titty, make sure
there ain't no moles on there?

00:33:50.336 --> 00:33:53.130
- You can look at both titties, man.
- Man.

00:33:53.297 --> 00:33:57.134
I've been looking at the same busted
titties for the past almost 20 years.

00:33:57.301 --> 00:34:01.847
- I'm due for another new titty.
- Please help us. Please.

00:34:02.014 --> 00:34:03.766
Please.

00:34:06.352 --> 00:34:08.854
Yes. Yes. I love you.

00:34:11.732 --> 00:34:13.442
Well, don't mind that smell.

00:34:13.609 --> 00:34:16.445
We had some homeless people
squatting in here.

00:34:16.612 --> 00:34:19.865
You know, they'd void their bowels
everywhere but the bathroom.

00:34:20.032 --> 00:34:24.703
Anyway, you pick up the poop
and you've got yourself a movie studio.

00:34:24.870 --> 00:34:26.580
Why don't we shoot
in your apartment?

00:34:26.747 --> 00:34:28.916
No power.
You wanna pay our electric bill?

00:34:29.083 --> 00:34:32.002
- You motherfuckers...
- We'll take it.

00:34:34.880 --> 00:34:37.174
Bring it back.
- Fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:34:38.551 --> 00:34:41.554
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:44.807
Oh, God. Come on.

00:34:45.558 --> 00:34:49.645
Why the fuck do I have to
do everything? Fuckers.

00:34:52.189 --> 00:34:54.526
Hey, what is that?

00:34:55.235 --> 00:34:59.906
Fucking guys. This fucking
team, man. They fucking suck.

00:35:01.324 --> 00:35:04.244
I'm gonna hatefuck
the shit out of you, ref.

00:35:04.411 --> 00:35:06.746
- Dude.
- It's cool.

00:35:06.913 --> 00:35:08.748
- He's my cousin.
- Hey.

00:35:09.666 --> 00:35:13.253
Didn't you used to videotape the varsity
basketball games in high school?

00:35:13.628 --> 00:35:17.424
Just the away games. I did it because
I was trying to fuck a cheerleader.

00:35:17.591 --> 00:35:18.592
Which one?

00:35:18.758 --> 00:35:22.637
Whichever one wanted to fuck the guy
who taped the varsity games.

00:35:22.929 --> 00:35:25.599
- Aw.
- Still know how to work a camera?

00:35:25.765 --> 00:35:28.852
- Who cares what the title is?
- The porn I liked when I was a kid,

00:35:29.019 --> 00:35:31.688
it was always, like,
a spoof of a popular movie, you know?

00:35:31.855 --> 00:35:34.399
Like, um, Edward Penishands.

00:35:34.566 --> 00:35:38.445
Okay, so we need a mildly clever,
vaguely dirty title,

00:35:38.612 --> 00:35:40.197
that sounds like a real movie

00:35:40.363 --> 00:35:42.949
- and sums up what you're gonna see.
- Correct.

00:35:43.116 --> 00:35:45.243
An American Werewolf in Brenda?

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.120
Fuckback Mountain?

00:35:48.288 --> 00:35:51.458
- Too soon? A Cock-in-Lips Now?
- Next.

00:35:51.625 --> 00:35:53.752
Cradle the balls. Work the shaft.

00:35:53.919 --> 00:35:56.922
Jerk my come-crayon
and let me color you white.

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:59.466
I need cock and I need it now.

00:35:59.633 --> 00:36:01.134
I'm fucking you in the puss.

00:36:01.301 --> 00:36:03.470
I'm fucking you in the puss.

00:36:03.637 --> 00:36:05.805
It's "puss" as in pussy.

00:36:06.348 --> 00:36:10.268
Oh, because I was like,
who would wanna fuck puss?

00:36:10.435 --> 00:36:16.650
I want to slam my ham in your can,
woman. Scene.

00:36:16.816 --> 00:36:20.528
- This guy is amazing.
- This guy's great-looking too.

00:36:20.695 --> 00:36:21.988
I wanna fuck him.

00:36:22.155 --> 00:36:26.284
Hi, my name's Delaney
and I'm a producer.

00:36:26.451 --> 00:36:29.496
I really don't know what it means. I'm
gonna be honest, this is my first time.

00:36:29.663 --> 00:36:33.833
You don't have to worry, I'm not gonna
touch you or nothing like that.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.128
- All right.
- I have a wife, you know.

00:36:37.295 --> 00:36:41.758
We're happy. I mean, not happy,
but it's cool, you know.

00:36:42.467 --> 00:36:46.179
Just so you know,
there will be some fucking.

00:36:46.429 --> 00:36:50.100
- We'll talk about that if you get the part.
- Okay.

00:36:50.267 --> 00:36:53.395
I mean, not... We won't be fucking,
there'll be fucking in the movie.

00:36:53.561 --> 00:36:56.356
Like I said, I got a wife.
She don't play that shit.

00:36:56.523 --> 00:36:59.025
- She is a crazy bitch.
- Yep.

00:36:59.192 --> 00:37:03.822
It's my job as the producer
to see what you got.

00:37:04.281 --> 00:37:07.200
So if that makes you uncomfortable
in any way,

00:37:07.367 --> 00:37:13.456
you don't have to show me anything
you don't wanna show me, because...

00:37:14.833 --> 00:37:16.543
I love the movies.

00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:18.795
- Lawrence of a Labia.
- No.

00:37:18.962 --> 00:37:21.131
- Oh, come on.
- Dawn of the Dick.

00:37:21.298 --> 00:37:24.134
Yeah, but how are zombies doing it
at all sexy?

00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:27.095
I want to eat your brain

00:37:27.262 --> 00:37:29.347
and your ass.

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:32.809
- Dude.
- Sci-fi.

00:37:32.976 --> 00:37:36.730
Yeah. Close Encounters
With a Turd From Behind.

00:37:36.896 --> 00:37:39.065
- I don't know what that means.
- Just asses.

00:37:39.232 --> 00:37:41.234
Fucking deep in asses.

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:46.239
What?

00:37:46.406 --> 00:37:48.450
We're making a porno
and we just need to know

00:37:48.616 --> 00:37:51.995
what you would be or would not be
interested in doing.

00:37:52.162 --> 00:37:53.413
If anything.

00:37:54.247 --> 00:37:56.666
- No anal.
- Oh, definitely no anal.

00:37:56.833 --> 00:37:58.585
Anal and hugging.

00:37:58.752 --> 00:38:00.086
I don't do ass stuff.

00:38:00.253 --> 00:38:02.672
- Anal.
- Ah, fuck.

00:38:02.839 --> 00:38:06.092
- Oh, wait, oral. I like anal.
- Yay.

00:38:06.259 --> 00:38:09.596
Okay, well,
so, uh, do you have any special skills?

00:38:09.763 --> 00:38:11.389
Special skills?

00:38:12.932 --> 00:38:15.602
I can get a boner really quick
and it sticks straight up.

00:38:15.769 --> 00:38:17.771
- Is that really a special skill?
- I think.

00:38:17.937 --> 00:38:20.732
- Can you show us what you mean?
- Sure.

00:38:28.698 --> 00:38:30.075
Oh, that is special.

00:38:31.785 --> 00:38:32.994
Yeah, you're hired, Mr...

00:38:33.161 --> 00:38:34.954
- Who are you again?
- Lester.

00:38:35.121 --> 00:38:37.624
Lester "The Molester" Cockinshtuff.

00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:38.792
No.

00:38:38.958 --> 00:38:41.961
That is the best porn name
I've ever heard, man.

00:38:42.128 --> 00:38:43.463
I can have a porn name?

00:38:44.297 --> 00:38:48.134
- Then I'll be Pete Jones.
- Okay.

00:38:48.551 --> 00:38:49.969
Are you Granny Panties?

00:38:50.136 --> 00:38:52.138
- She is.
- Get the fuck out of here.

00:38:52.305 --> 00:38:53.890
The panties
are actually in the house.

00:38:54.057 --> 00:38:55.100
- I'll get them.
- Whoa.

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:58.813
The Wrath of Cunt.
- We never made a Star Sex 1.

00:38:58.979 --> 00:39:01.649
I guess we can lose Star Sex 3:
The Search for Cock, then.

00:39:01.816 --> 00:39:03.651
- Cocunt.
- What's that?

00:39:03.818 --> 00:39:05.444
It's Cocoon with a cunt.

00:39:07.154 --> 00:39:11.325
So Delaney tells us
you have a special talent of some sort.

00:39:11.492 --> 00:39:13.994
I don't know if I'd
call it a special talent,

00:39:14.161 --> 00:39:17.665
but it's a little something I picked up
doing bachelor parties.

00:39:17.832 --> 00:39:20.584
It would probably be easier
if I just showed you.

00:39:21.210 --> 00:39:23.003
- Great.
- The floor is yours.

00:39:38.853 --> 00:39:41.772
So a movie, huh? That could be fun.

00:39:52.116 --> 00:39:54.118
Holy fuck.

00:39:58.706 --> 00:40:00.875
Her name's Bubbles.

00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:04.920
- Invasion of the Potty-Snatchers?
- That's like MAD Magazine stupid.

00:40:05.087 --> 00:40:09.049
Well, fuck you, okay? You try to think
of a good sci-fi porno title. It's hard.

00:40:09.216 --> 00:40:12.219
There's gotta be one we haven't
thought of that would say it all,

00:40:12.386 --> 00:40:14.388
not be ridiculously filthy
and off-putting,

00:40:14.555 --> 00:40:17.725
and still have instant recognition
with our audience.

00:40:19.351 --> 00:40:20.478
- I got it.
- I got it.

00:40:21.395 --> 00:40:24.273
- Star Whores.
- Yeah. It's funny, right?

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.359
See, we figured this opens us up
to an even bigger sales market

00:40:27.526 --> 00:40:29.570
beyond the people we went
to school with.

00:40:29.737 --> 00:40:31.489
People who like comics and sci-fi.

00:40:31.655 --> 00:40:33.407
Comics? Like "Ziggy"?

00:40:33.574 --> 00:40:36.744
"Ziggy"? Is that even in fucking papers
anymore? No, man.

00:40:36.911 --> 00:40:39.872
Fuck you. "Ziggy" is a comic,
right next to "Family Circus."

00:40:40.039 --> 00:40:42.416
No, like Spider-Man and shit,
you know?

00:40:42.791 --> 00:40:46.170
There's always a shitload of Star Wars
nerds at those comic-book shows.

00:40:46.337 --> 00:40:49.798
So we sell them a Princess Leia
they can really fucking jerk off to.

00:40:49.965 --> 00:40:54.053
- That'd be me, Princess Lay-Her.
- Who am I playing?

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:57.681
You, my friend,
are the lead role of Lubed Guy-Baller.

00:40:57.848 --> 00:40:59.433
Man, he's gonna be balling dudes?

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.644
I thought you said
this was boys on girls.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:04.480
If I have to fuck a guy, okay,
but I'd rather fuck a girl.

00:41:04.647 --> 00:41:06.357
What's wrong with you, boy?

00:41:06.524 --> 00:41:09.902
- We'll change the name to Sky-Baller.
- Sky-Baller.

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:12.112
I will be Hung So-low.

00:41:12.279 --> 00:41:16.033
Delaney, my friend,
you are On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:18.536
Man, I can't be in no porno.
My wife will kill me.

00:41:18.702 --> 00:41:22.081
Hump me, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over.
You're my only hump.

00:41:22.248 --> 00:41:24.124
On the other hand, fuck my wife.

00:41:24.291 --> 00:41:27.586
Unfortunately, On-Ur-Knees Bend-Over
does not have any sex in the movie

00:41:27.753 --> 00:41:32.550
but the droids do,
l-CUP and R2-T-Bag.

00:41:32.716 --> 00:41:35.135
I robot.

00:41:35.302 --> 00:41:40.140
And Stacey over here
is gonna play Darth Vibrator.

00:41:40.307 --> 00:41:42.560
- I'm the bad guy?
- She's not a guy, Zack.

00:41:42.726 --> 00:41:45.020
I know that
because I'm not a fucking idiot.

00:41:45.187 --> 00:41:48.732
In our movie,
Darth Vibrator is a bad girl

00:41:48.899 --> 00:41:50.401
who wants to fuck the galaxy,

00:41:50.568 --> 00:41:54.947
literally, and it's up to Lubed and Hung
to stop her with their cocks.

00:41:55.114 --> 00:41:57.157
- You and me get to have sex, then?
- Yeah.

00:41:57.324 --> 00:41:59.952
- Cool.
- I know. Isn't that awesome?

00:42:00.119 --> 00:42:03.789
Hold up, hold up. So who's all having
sex with who in this movie?

00:42:03.956 --> 00:42:06.041
As of last night,
I was having sex with Zack.

00:42:06.208 --> 00:42:11.255
What? Han Solo ain't never had no sex
with Princess Leia in the Star Wars.

00:42:11.422 --> 00:42:13.882
Guys, this isn't
a literal adaptation here.

00:42:14.049 --> 00:42:17.177
It's more of an erotic re-imagining.

00:42:17.344 --> 00:42:20.931
Kind of like The Wiz or like a parody.
With lots of anal.

00:42:21.098 --> 00:42:23.767
- Cool.
- I know, isn't that awesome?

00:42:24.268 --> 00:42:28.355
I have a question, do Princess Lay-Her
and Lubed Sky-Baller have sex?

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:32.651
Uh, no, because
they're brother and sister,

00:42:32.818 --> 00:42:35.487
and according to Miri,
brothers and sisters can't fuck.

00:42:35.654 --> 00:42:38.073
But you said,
that this wasn't a literal translation,

00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:42.161
so that means Lester's character
could have sex with Miri's character.

00:42:42.328 --> 00:42:46.457
Because I would love to fucking eat
her ass and fuck her silly in the movie.

00:42:46.624 --> 00:42:49.043
Dream on, pal,
it's never gonna happen, okay?

00:42:49.209 --> 00:42:52.046
- No, I'm fine with it.
- See, she's fine... Wait, what?

00:42:52.212 --> 00:42:55.299
Yep. I mean, everyone else is having
sex with more than one person

00:42:55.466 --> 00:42:57.217
in this movie all of a sudden,

00:42:57.384 --> 00:43:02.682
so I think it's, you know,
not fair if I'm only fucking you.

00:43:03.350 --> 00:43:06.353
Guys, read amongst yourselves, okay?
Can I talk to you for a sec?

00:43:06.978 --> 00:43:08.813
Look, Miri,

00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.400
we got plenty of sex going on in this
thing, you don't have to do that.

00:43:12.567 --> 00:43:16.154
Zack, it's fine. I mean I have slept with
way worse-looking guys than Lester.

00:43:16.321 --> 00:43:18.990
I just wanna do my part for the movie
like everyone else.

00:43:19.157 --> 00:43:22.285
You're having sex in the movie,
you don't need to fuck someone else.

00:43:22.452 --> 00:43:24.746
- You're good.
- I'm only fucking you, though.

00:43:24.913 --> 00:43:28.750
So don't we need to vary it up
to keep it fair?

00:43:28.917 --> 00:43:31.211
Fair for...? I don't... What?
Fair for who?

00:43:31.378 --> 00:43:33.755
What are these,
blood diamonds we're talking about?

00:43:33.922 --> 00:43:37.342
Fair for everyone else
who is fucking more than one person,

00:43:37.509 --> 00:43:39.427
a.k.a. you, in the movie.

00:43:39.594 --> 00:43:42.764
- I mean, fine...
- All right. I mean, if you don't care...

00:43:42.931 --> 00:43:45.850
I don't fucking care if you fuck him.
Fuck. I don't give a shit.

00:43:46.017 --> 00:43:49.020
Like you said, you know,
you've fucked bigger idiots than Lester.

00:43:49.187 --> 00:43:53.608
Holy shit. Are we really gonna
shoot this in outer space?

00:43:53.775 --> 00:43:55.276
Maybe not bigger idiots.

00:44:43.032 --> 00:44:44.492
Thank you.

00:45:09.559 --> 00:45:14.189
- Cut. All right, guys, that's it.
- Yeah.

00:45:14.355 --> 00:45:18.026
Make sure you leave your costume
so we know they're here for tomorrow.

00:45:18.193 --> 00:45:22.071
Mostly, everybody, thank you so much
for helping us get ready, you know.

00:45:22.238 --> 00:45:26.284
Cleaning this place out, building the
sets, sewing the costumes, it's just...

00:45:26.451 --> 00:45:28.286
I mean, it's really amazing. Thank you.

00:45:28.453 --> 00:45:29.788
Seriously, thanks.

00:45:29.954 --> 00:45:34.375
But this is just the beginning, guys.
If Star Whores works, and it will,

00:45:34.542 --> 00:45:37.962
we are set up for sequels galore.
The Empire Strikes Ass.

00:45:38.129 --> 00:45:40.840
- Return of the Brown-Eye.
- The Phantom Man-Ass.

00:45:41.007 --> 00:45:44.511
And Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter.

00:45:46.638 --> 00:45:49.015
- Okay.
- Revenge of the Shit.

00:45:49.599 --> 00:45:52.393
- You got it?
- Yeah, no, we got it.

00:45:52.727 --> 00:45:53.770
Ew.

00:45:53.937 --> 00:45:56.439
- Fuck you, motherfuckers.
- We'll talk about that one.

00:45:56.606 --> 00:45:59.025
We're gonna have a lot of fun,
but more importantly,

00:45:59.192 --> 00:46:01.069
we're gonna make
a lot of fucking money, okay?

00:46:01.236 --> 00:46:03.238
- Yeah.
- So get ready for greatness, people.

00:46:03.404 --> 00:46:05.073
Tomorrow we start
principal photography.

00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:07.408
- Whoo!
- Yeah.

00:46:07.742 --> 00:46:10.078
- All right, good night, you guys.
- We got a movie.

00:46:14.207 --> 00:46:16.084
- What?
- Nothing.

00:46:16.251 --> 00:46:19.963
I think someone should acknowledge
how insane and amazing this is

00:46:20.129 --> 00:46:23.383
- and it's all because of you.
- I don't know. It's just a porno.

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:27.512
You know what I mean.
You've really come into your own.

00:46:28.763 --> 00:46:30.014
Shut the fuck up.

00:46:31.224 --> 00:46:35.270
So speaking of coming into things,
ready for tomorrow? Twenty years,

00:46:35.436 --> 00:46:38.273
we're finally gonna know what it's like
to have sex with each other.

00:46:38.439 --> 00:46:39.941
You say that like
you've been wondering

00:46:40.108 --> 00:46:42.235
what it'd be like to sleep with me
for a while now.

00:46:42.402 --> 00:46:45.029
Why the fuck do you think
I started hanging out with you?

00:46:45.196 --> 00:46:49.200
I knew it. Here, help.

00:46:52.787 --> 00:46:57.083
Let's just promise that it's not gonna
change anything between us, okay?

00:46:57.250 --> 00:46:58.293
- Like what?
- I don't know.

00:46:58.459 --> 00:47:00.628
Some guys
can't keep sex in perspective.

00:47:00.795 --> 00:47:03.507
If anyone's gotta keep this
in perspective, it's you, okay?

00:47:03.674 --> 00:47:06.635
I don't want you getting all mushy
and gooey on me

00:47:06.802 --> 00:47:09.305
after I give you the best orgasm
you've ever had.

00:47:09.471 --> 00:47:11.849
Oh, like you know what you're doing
down there at all.

00:47:12.016 --> 00:47:14.894
I actually don't. Where's the clitoris?
Is it in your ass?

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.813
Just, you know,
make sure you kind of whoop it up

00:47:17.980 --> 00:47:22.318
and act like I'm a stud who knows
what he's doing, okay? Just be a pal.

00:47:22.484 --> 00:47:26.280
Oh, dude, I am gonna Meryl Streep the
fuck out of this tomorrow, you watch.

00:47:28.866 --> 00:47:32.077
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:47:32.244 --> 00:47:34.496
No. Really, thank you.

00:47:36.498 --> 00:47:38.459
For everything.

00:47:40.169 --> 00:47:42.129
You're welcome.

00:47:48.177 --> 00:47:50.888
Less than 12 hours
and we make Monroeville history.

00:47:51.055 --> 00:47:55.768
- I really hope nothing goes wrong.
- It's a movie. What could go wrong?

00:48:04.568 --> 00:48:06.779
What are you doing?

00:48:08.697 --> 00:48:10.866
What's up?
- What the fuck?

00:48:11.033 --> 00:48:12.368
What are you doing?

00:48:12.534 --> 00:48:14.536
- What are you doing?
- Wait, wait.

00:48:14.703 --> 00:48:16.664
- Wait.
- Stop. Stop.

00:48:17.873 --> 00:48:21.043
- No, no, no.
- What the fuck is going on?

00:48:21.210 --> 00:48:24.296
Condos is what's going on,
as soon as this shit-hole's demo'd.

00:48:24.463 --> 00:48:25.923
No, you gotta stop it right now.

00:48:26.090 --> 00:48:28.467
We rented this place for a month
from Mr. Jenkins.

00:48:28.634 --> 00:48:30.844
Sounds like your Mr. Jenkins
was full of shit.

00:48:31.011 --> 00:48:33.472
Luxury Homesteads
bought this place a month ago.

00:48:33.639 --> 00:48:35.349
I'm gonna kill that lying old fuck.

00:48:35.516 --> 00:48:38.018
You're gonna have to go Florida,
that's where he moved.

00:48:38.185 --> 00:48:40.396
We've got thousands of dollars
of equipment in there.

00:48:40.562 --> 00:48:43.190
- Please.
- If you wanna sift through this rubble

00:48:43.357 --> 00:48:47.277
when we're done, be my guest.
Hey, get that fucking beam down.

00:49:04.628 --> 00:49:06.880
This is the last thing you wanna hear.

00:49:07.047 --> 00:49:08.424
If you don't get an advance,

00:49:08.590 --> 00:49:11.051
I don't think we're gonna keep
a roof over our heads.

00:49:11.218 --> 00:49:14.930
I got an advance already.
It went into all the costumes.

00:49:15.097 --> 00:49:17.933
- So all our money's gone?
- All your money?

00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.603
Never mind what my wife's gonna do
when there ain't no new snow tires,

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:24.690
or when she sees
I charged a video camera.

00:49:24.857 --> 00:49:26.734
I'm sorry I dragged you into this, man.

00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:28.777
I just wanted to see some free titties.

00:49:29.445 --> 00:49:35.284
That's all. But there's no such thing
as free titties, is there, Zack?

00:49:36.368 --> 00:49:38.579
- Is there?
- Fuck this noise.

00:49:38.746 --> 00:49:41.457
Why don't we get another camera,
and shoot something else?

00:49:41.623 --> 00:49:44.043
Where are we gonna do that?
Got another sound stage?

00:49:44.209 --> 00:49:48.255
Sound stage? We had a shit-covered
garage we turned into a sound stage.

00:49:48.422 --> 00:49:51.091
We find someplace new
and we do it again.

00:49:52.468 --> 00:49:53.886
How? Okay, I'm broke, man.

00:49:54.053 --> 00:49:58.557
No, make that, I was broke.
Now I am really tapped out.

00:49:58.724 --> 00:50:01.143
I have to get another job
to pay Delaney back.

00:50:01.310 --> 00:50:04.813
So please tell me,
how can I afford to start over?

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:07.149
- What can I get you?
- Yeah, can I get a, uh...?

00:50:07.316 --> 00:50:10.652
Too fucking late. Cappuccino, 3.50.

00:50:10.819 --> 00:50:12.821
I don't know
what the fuck I was thinking.

00:50:12.988 --> 00:50:18.160
I mean, I'm a total loser
in every single other aspect of my life.

00:50:18.327 --> 00:50:20.204
What made me think
I could do something

00:50:20.370 --> 00:50:22.164
as simple as filming people fucking?

00:50:22.331 --> 00:50:25.167
We have no money left,
nowhere to shoot, no sets,

00:50:25.334 --> 00:50:27.586
we have no fucking cameras. Here.

00:50:29.129 --> 00:50:31.965
It's time I go back to my regular life

00:50:32.132 --> 00:50:36.178
where I am a quiet fuckup
who doesn't cost anybody any money

00:50:36.345 --> 00:50:39.431
and knows his goddamn position
behind this fucking counter

00:50:39.598 --> 00:50:42.726
making cappuccinos
for this fucking guy.

00:50:47.064 --> 00:50:50.359
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:50:55.864 --> 00:50:57.533
What are you doing?

00:50:59.284 --> 00:51:00.702
Oh, yeah.

00:51:01.328 --> 00:51:03.247
Yeah.

00:51:08.670 --> 00:51:10.505
Fuck, yes.

00:51:13.049 --> 00:51:14.050
Zack.

00:51:36.114 --> 00:51:40.994
You sneaky Indian motherfucker.
I tell you, yes.

00:51:42.203 --> 00:51:45.248
Swallow My Cockuccino.

00:51:45.415 --> 00:51:48.084
- What?
- That's it. That's the movie.

00:51:48.251 --> 00:51:51.796
Why didn't I think of it before?
We don't need sets or a stage.

00:51:51.963 --> 00:51:55.550
Look at all this production value,
waiting to have balls on it.

00:51:55.717 --> 00:51:58.428
Hold up. You wanna shoot
a dirty movie here, where we work?

00:51:58.595 --> 00:51:59.596
Yes.

00:51:59.762 --> 00:52:03.266
Fuck, yes, I do. You know how many
stories I have from working here?

00:52:03.433 --> 00:52:07.395
How many times I've been laid
right there after hours?

00:52:07.562 --> 00:52:09.189
You've never gotten laid here
after hours.

00:52:09.355 --> 00:52:11.441
I know. Thank you for reminding me.

00:52:11.608 --> 00:52:16.571
But I always wish I had,
and that's what porno is. It's fantasy.

00:52:16.738 --> 00:52:22.076
It's taking the normal
and making it abnormal by fucking it.

00:52:22.243 --> 00:52:24.621
Don't do that.
The little dog don't like that.

00:52:24.787 --> 00:52:26.247
How did you get a camera?

00:52:26.414 --> 00:52:30.293
By being a terrible, untrustworthy
employee, that's how.

00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.632
Give me today, I'll bang out a script.
Meet me back here after closing.

00:52:35.798 --> 00:52:40.970
We're gonna launch arching ropes of
jism all over this motherfucker. Peace.

00:52:42.764 --> 00:52:46.601
I like that guy but if he tries
to fuck that little dog tonight for real,

00:52:46.768 --> 00:52:48.937
I'm calling the Humane Society.

00:52:51.147 --> 00:52:55.068
It's called Bean-N-Gone,
so get the fuck out of here. Hey, Barry.

00:53:00.823 --> 00:53:03.910
Stand by, Stace, picture's up.
- Okay.

00:53:04.077 --> 00:53:05.954
Roll tape.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.834
Swallow My Cockuccino,
Scene 12, Take 1.

00:53:19.759 --> 00:53:21.886
And action.

00:53:30.019 --> 00:53:33.648
I'd like a double espresso
so I can stay up all night

00:53:33.815 --> 00:53:36.359
because I'm in the mood to fuck.

00:53:36.526 --> 00:53:41.030
Well, I am a whore-ista, so I love
to fuck. Would you like to fuck me?

00:53:41.197 --> 00:53:45.201
Holy fuck. You mean,
after you're done with your shift?

00:53:45.368 --> 00:53:48.329
I mean during my shift.

00:53:49.205 --> 00:53:51.499
- Sorry.
- Keep going, keep going.

00:53:51.666 --> 00:53:54.043
With your shaft.

00:54:04.345 --> 00:54:08.099
Let us fuck.

00:54:12.103 --> 00:54:13.896
Cue music.

00:54:19.694 --> 00:54:22.071
Okay, open up to camera,
guys. Let us see it.

00:54:25.575 --> 00:54:26.743
More tongue.

00:54:29.871 --> 00:54:31.331
Little less tongue.

00:54:35.668 --> 00:54:37.587
Oh, that was good.

00:54:43.343 --> 00:54:44.427
Cue effects.

00:55:01.778 --> 00:55:04.155
Oh, yeah, like that.

00:55:04.322 --> 00:55:06.450
Oh, yeah.

00:55:07.618 --> 00:55:10.662
See, I told you it would work.
Didn't I tell you? It looks amazing.

00:55:10.829 --> 00:55:12.373
It's incredible.

00:55:12.956 --> 00:55:15.626
Oh, the beans hurt. Easy.

00:55:15.918 --> 00:55:18.796
- Move in for coverage.
- Nice.

00:55:19.129 --> 00:55:20.214
That's why we got him.

00:55:20.381 --> 00:55:23.634
- Nice. I'm impressed.
- Get in there, Deacon.

00:55:23.801 --> 00:55:27.137
- Come on.
- Like that? Like that.

00:55:27.304 --> 00:55:30.933
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Look at that.

00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:32.976
- Pull out a bit, actually.
- That's hot.

00:55:33.143 --> 00:55:35.062
No, not you, Lester. Put it back in.

00:55:35.229 --> 00:55:36.730
Kiss the muscle.

00:55:37.314 --> 00:55:39.316
- I kiss the muscle.
- You kiss the muscle.

00:55:39.983 --> 00:55:43.070
- Can he slap her ass a little?
- Don't be a fucking pervert, dude.

00:55:43.237 --> 00:55:47.157
- Stir, come on. Stir.
- Yeah, stir it.

00:55:47.574 --> 00:55:50.285
Stir it, baby.

00:55:59.086 --> 00:56:00.254
Hey.

00:56:01.630 --> 00:56:03.090
- Holy.
- Shit.

00:56:03.257 --> 00:56:05.467
Are you guys still open?

00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:10.973
No. We close at 9.

00:56:11.807 --> 00:56:14.017
I need coffee so I'm drive home.

00:56:14.476 --> 00:56:17.604
- Okay. Yeah.
- Thank you.

00:56:18.939 --> 00:56:21.108
That's a cute kitty.

00:56:21.775 --> 00:56:22.943
Okay.

00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:31.201
Hey.

00:56:31.368 --> 00:56:33.036
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:56:33.203 --> 00:56:36.999
You guys see the game? I was at it.

00:56:37.166 --> 00:56:42.546
Fucking Roethlisberger,
the quarterback, was all fucking,

00:56:42.713 --> 00:56:48.469
"Hug it, chug it, football. All night."
Heh-heh.

00:56:48.635 --> 00:56:50.971
Okay, pal, here you go.
On the house.

00:56:51.305 --> 00:56:53.515
- I love you.
- I love you too. Have a good one.

00:56:53.682 --> 00:56:56.935
- Yeah, I'll have a cold one.
- I said, have a good one.

00:56:59.062 --> 00:57:01.815
- Okay. Keep moving.
- You and your little dog.

00:57:02.691 --> 00:57:04.860
Go Steelers.

00:57:10.741 --> 00:57:11.992
Action.

00:57:12.493 --> 00:57:16.538
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, like that.

00:57:16.705 --> 00:57:21.585
Oh, fuck it, chuck it, football.
Oh, yeah.

00:57:21.919 --> 00:57:23.253
Oh, God, this is good.

00:57:25.923 --> 00:57:32.221
You take it. You take it.
Take it, Barry. Oh, take it.

00:57:32.387 --> 00:57:35.390
Take it, Barry. Take it.

00:57:36.225 --> 00:57:39.603
I'm disturbed
at how turned on I am by this.

00:57:40.687 --> 00:57:42.314
- Shit, dude, it's almost 6.
- Oh, fuck.

00:57:42.481 --> 00:57:44.608
Okay, that's a wrap,
everybody, yeah.

00:57:44.775 --> 00:57:47.778
Let's give a hand to our hotties
with the bodies from last night.

00:57:47.945 --> 00:57:50.447
Stacey, Lester,
Bubbles, Barry, whoo.

00:57:50.614 --> 00:57:51.698
Yeah.
- Nice.

00:57:51.865 --> 00:57:53.659
Okay, when we come back tonight,

00:57:53.825 --> 00:57:57.663
we finish up the venti-vulva scene, and
then we get into me and Miri's stuff.

00:57:57.829 --> 00:58:01.542
Again, amazing first night, everybody.
Thank you so much.

00:58:04.628 --> 00:58:06.838
Let us fuck.

00:58:10.008 --> 00:58:12.344
- Hey, how'd it look?
- How do you think it looked?

00:58:12.511 --> 00:58:15.973
It looked like shit going
into other shit, in focus.

00:58:16.139 --> 00:58:19.768
What an artist. That was Kurosawa's
motto. "Shit going into other shit."

00:58:19.935 --> 00:58:22.104
Oh, man,
I can't believe you gotta work now.

00:58:22.271 --> 00:58:25.065
It's okay. You know, honestly,
I don't think I could sleep.

00:58:25.232 --> 00:58:28.569
- I'm pretty, like, pumped up right now.
- Right? It was amazing.

00:58:28.735 --> 00:58:30.946
It was awesome.
I think the cast and crew had a good time.

00:58:31.113 --> 00:58:33.323
- We were getting great shit.
- Yeah, it was so fun.

00:58:33.490 --> 00:58:35.951
I just wanna keep shooting
people boning all day.

00:58:36.326 --> 00:58:39.496
I don't think I've ever met
the ambitious Zack Brown before.

00:58:40.163 --> 00:58:43.458
- Well, I'm trying to pay the bills, so...
- It's not a bad thing.

00:58:44.668 --> 00:58:46.837
I think it looks good on you.

00:59:33.635 --> 00:59:38.014
Come on, hurry.
Come on, come on, come on.

00:59:39.098 --> 00:59:40.224
Wait a minute.

00:59:40.391 --> 00:59:42.810
- You guys never did it before?
- It's fine.

00:59:43.269 --> 00:59:48.441
You know, we talked about it
and it's just for the movie.

00:59:48.608 --> 00:59:50.610
We're friends, you know,
we're just friends.

00:59:50.777 --> 00:59:54.656
And we will always just be
just friends, so...

00:59:54.822 --> 00:59:58.201
Listen, I have some extra lube
from last night.

00:59:58.368 --> 01:00:01.746
I understand it's kind of hard getting
wet when everyone's watching.

01:00:01.913 --> 01:00:03.748
At least it was for Barry.

01:00:03.915 --> 01:00:06.876
- I don't know if I am gonna need it.
- Really?

01:00:07.043 --> 01:00:10.505
Yeah, I think I'm just excited.

01:00:12.674 --> 01:00:15.259
At the idea of people watching,
not because of Zack.

01:00:15.426 --> 01:00:18.554
Oh, God. Zack could never have that
effect on me in a million years.

01:00:18.721 --> 01:00:21.265
- Hello, Miriam.
- Oh, hey.

01:00:22.642 --> 01:00:24.435
- Your face.
- Yeah. Weird, huh?

01:00:24.602 --> 01:00:27.021
I don't think I've seen your face
since senior year.

01:00:27.188 --> 01:00:28.356
I think I made a mistake.

01:00:28.523 --> 01:00:31.442
I did it for you so you wouldn't
get road rash during our scene,

01:00:31.609 --> 01:00:34.779
but I should have asked first,
I look like a fucking beluga whale.

01:00:35.196 --> 01:00:37.782
I think I'll be going now.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.868
Okay.

01:00:47.625 --> 01:00:50.002
All I keep thinking is
we should've done a trial run

01:00:50.169 --> 01:00:51.629
at home last week or something.

01:00:51.796 --> 01:00:53.589
- Oh, my God. Right?
- I know.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:01.139
- You're still cool to do it, though, right?
- Yeah, um. Totally. Are you?

01:01:01.305 --> 01:01:03.433
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You know, I'm...

01:01:03.808 --> 01:01:06.269
- Honestly, I'm a little nervous, I guess.
- You are?

01:01:06.436 --> 01:01:08.730
- It's kind of a big deal.
- It is?

01:01:08.896 --> 01:01:12.817
Yeah, you know,
it's our first time together

01:01:14.235 --> 01:01:18.489
since our auspicious debut
on viral video.

01:01:19.657 --> 01:01:20.742
Oh, yeah.

01:01:20.908 --> 01:01:23.161
That's a fuckload of pressure
for a director.

01:01:23.661 --> 01:01:27.165
As a director, please. What about
the anxiety I'm feeling as an actress?

01:01:27.331 --> 01:01:30.668
- Did I pick the right project?
- Yeah. What about this follow-up?

01:01:30.835 --> 01:01:33.838
Julia Roberts followed Pretty Waman
with Sleeping With the Enemy.

01:01:34.005 --> 01:01:36.966
I'm following Granny Panties
with Swallow My Cockuccino.

01:01:37.133 --> 01:01:39.385
Only difference is
this movie's about cock-sucking

01:01:39.552 --> 01:01:41.637
and her movie just sucked cock,
period.

01:01:41.804 --> 01:01:44.849
- The only difference, yeah.
- The end was pretty rad.

01:01:45.475 --> 01:01:47.351
I liked that.

01:01:48.895 --> 01:01:51.439
- When she kills him.
- With a gun.

01:01:51.606 --> 01:01:52.732
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:01:52.899 --> 01:01:55.318
- She calls the cops first.
- She calls it in first.

01:01:55.485 --> 01:01:57.361
- It was so awesome.
- Awesome, yeah.

01:01:59.614 --> 01:02:01.866
So I guess we should do this.

01:02:02.033 --> 01:02:06.454
I think we should probably wait just
until I lose another 20 or 30 pounds.

01:02:06.621 --> 01:02:09.540
Stop it. You look good.

01:02:09.707 --> 01:02:11.209
Thanks.

01:02:12.877 --> 01:02:16.631
So, what about me? How do I look?

01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:21.511
I mean, you look beautiful.
You always look so beautiful,

01:02:21.677 --> 01:02:25.890
so I guess it's not a big deal,
but you look amazing.

01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:38.069
- Okay. Let's go make a porno.
- Okay.

01:02:39.195 --> 01:02:43.074
Swallow My Cockuccino,
Scene 8, Take 1.

01:02:43.241 --> 01:02:45.701
Come here.
- I'm over...?

01:02:46.369 --> 01:02:48.246
All right, settle.

01:02:48.996 --> 01:02:50.414
Action.

01:02:52.041 --> 01:02:54.418
Who could it be?

01:03:01.634 --> 01:03:02.802
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:02.969 --> 01:03:06.430
I'm a delivery man
and I have some cream for you.

01:03:06.597 --> 01:03:10.101
Wow, that cream looks heavy.
You must be strong.

01:03:10.268 --> 01:03:11.728
I work out.

01:03:11.895 --> 01:03:16.108
So do you want me
to give you your cream now?

01:03:16.275 --> 01:03:20.028
I've been waiting for it all day.

01:03:21.113 --> 01:03:22.114
- Fuck. Come on.
- Oops.

01:03:22.281 --> 01:03:23.866
Keep going.

01:03:24.032 --> 01:03:28.453
I spilled my cream. Do you mind?

01:03:28.620 --> 01:03:33.959
I don't mind.
Especially if you spill it on my face.

01:03:34.418 --> 01:03:36.461
Let us fuck.

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:44.803
- Fix my shirt. Think I should?
- Okay.

01:03:44.970 --> 01:03:48.056
Let me see them titties.

01:03:48.473 --> 01:03:51.560
Actually, you know what? Sorry,
I don't think we should show them.

01:03:51.727 --> 01:03:54.021
- What?
- We shouldn't show your breasts.

01:03:54.187 --> 01:03:57.274
- Aren't you gonna take your shirt off?
- I'm just gonna open it.

01:03:57.441 --> 01:03:59.192
You're not gonna take it off? Why not?

01:03:59.359 --> 01:04:02.321
My tits are bigger than yours.
I don't wanna show that.

01:04:02.487 --> 01:04:05.449
She's not gonna show her tits?
I showed my cock and my asshole.

01:04:05.616 --> 01:04:07.951
- Okay, I'll do your pants.
- Back and forth. okay.

01:04:08.118 --> 01:04:10.495
- Holy shit.
- Where's that delivery?

01:04:10.662 --> 01:04:15.959
I can't believe this. I was delivering
cream, and look what's happening.

01:04:16.126 --> 01:04:19.922
- Jesus, what is that, a rumba?
- What's a rumba?

01:04:20.088 --> 01:04:22.007
That awkward movement.

01:04:23.675 --> 01:04:26.678
- Should I take your underpants off?
- Yeah, take them off.

01:04:29.681 --> 01:04:31.141
What the fuck?
How does this work?

01:04:31.308 --> 01:04:33.226
They're just like... I'll do it.

01:04:33.393 --> 01:04:36.355
- I'll do mine, you just... You do yours.
- I'll do my pants.

01:04:45.238 --> 01:04:47.491
Granny panties.

01:04:49.368 --> 01:04:51.203
Just get on with it already.

01:04:52.496 --> 01:04:54.373
I'm gonna fuck you with my pecker.

01:04:54.539 --> 01:04:56.333
Dude, that's really dirty.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.502
- That's too dirty?
- That offends me.

01:04:58.669 --> 01:05:00.545
- Penis?
- Fine.

01:05:00.712 --> 01:05:03.882
- I'm gonna fuck you with my penis.
- I can't wait.

01:05:04.049 --> 01:05:05.884
For my penis.

01:05:06.051 --> 01:05:09.513
Be careful, Miri. Okay, there we go.
Just keep rolling, keep rolling.

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:14.351
- I'll walk forward.
- Fucking cream is coming.

01:05:16.979 --> 01:05:20.065
This is the worst porno
I've ever seen.

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:26.071
Get over here, delivery man.
- Let's fuck on these beans.

01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:29.282
- You okay?
- Yup.

01:05:29.449 --> 01:05:32.786
Okay, all right.
- Just leave them. Just leave them.

01:05:32.953 --> 01:05:35.414
- They're really distracting.
- You should leave them.

01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:37.874
- You gotta get your... There you go.
- Okay, okay.

01:05:38.041 --> 01:05:40.335
- Okay, okay.
- Okay. This okay?

01:05:44.339 --> 01:05:45.924
Okay.

01:05:46.091 --> 01:05:47.509
Okay.

01:05:47.926 --> 01:05:50.762
- We'll start kissing on three, okay?
- Okay.

01:05:50.929 --> 01:05:54.516
One, two, three. Go.

01:06:18.123 --> 01:06:20.042
I'm ready.

01:06:20.959 --> 01:06:24.463
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

01:06:33.597 --> 01:06:34.639
Deacon.

01:06:34.806 --> 01:06:37.059
- Deacon. Deacon.
- What?

01:06:37.225 --> 01:06:40.645
Did you see Lost this week, man?
I missed it. What happened?

01:06:40.812 --> 01:06:43.732
They're on the island, off the island.
Who can follow that?

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.025
I think they're in hell.

01:06:45.192 --> 01:06:46.985
Would you all shut the motherfuck up?

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.627
I want you to come.

01:07:03.794 --> 01:07:06.755
- I want you to come with me.
- Okay.

01:07:11.676 --> 01:07:13.888
Oh, God.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.531
Oh, God.

01:07:44.293 --> 01:07:45.461
Cut.

01:07:45.628 --> 01:07:50.383
That's it? It's over? Ain't he
supposed to come on her titties?

01:07:55.471 --> 01:07:58.099
Well, it wasn't what we'd shot-listed,
but that was nice.

01:07:58.266 --> 01:08:00.893
- It was so romantic.
- Way to fuck, Zack.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:03.271
Thanks, Lester, uh.

01:08:03.479 --> 01:08:07.150
It wasn't just me, though, guys. Give
it up for my radiant costar here, Miri.

01:08:08.526 --> 01:08:10.695
Nice.
- Um, show's over in here.

01:08:10.862 --> 01:08:12.947
Let's move out,
start lighting the next scene.

01:08:13.114 --> 01:08:14.866
- All right.
- Let's do it.

01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.618
You looked so beautiful.
- Thanks.

01:08:17.785 --> 01:08:19.704
I thought they were gonna
be fucking hard.

01:08:19.871 --> 01:08:21.539
- It was pretty.
- Pretty don't sell.

01:08:21.706 --> 01:08:23.749
- Good job.
- Thanks.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:27.003
You good, Mir? You need anything?

01:08:27.170 --> 01:08:29.088
I'm just gonna take a minute, okay?

01:08:29.255 --> 01:08:32.592
Okay, uh. I'll just be out there.

01:08:33.426 --> 01:08:34.927
Yeah.

01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:40.016
- That was fun.
- Yeah, fun.

01:08:41.893 --> 01:08:44.353
"Fun." You fucking douche.

01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:28.481
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:09:28.648 --> 01:09:31.484
- You working on a rewrite?
- Yeah, just for tonight's scene.

01:09:31.651 --> 01:09:34.237
- I'm ready to go when you are, though.
- Okay.

01:09:35.988 --> 01:09:42.828
You know, before we go, I...
I'm thinking that, uh, it's a good idea

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:45.331
if we talk about
what happened last night.

01:09:47.083 --> 01:09:49.794
- Oh.
- I mean, we don't have to, but I think...

01:09:49.961 --> 01:09:51.128
Okay, yeah, uh.

01:09:51.295 --> 01:09:53.297
I kind of dropped the ball on that,
I guess, huh?

01:09:53.464 --> 01:09:57.343
- No, no. It's...
- To be honest, it was...

01:09:57.510 --> 01:10:00.096
You know, I didn't realize
how weird it would be for me.

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:03.015
Weird? Like... Weird how?

01:10:03.641 --> 01:10:07.270
Acting and directing at the same time.
It's a lot to process, you know.

01:10:07.436 --> 01:10:11.190
For the first time, I thought my balls
didn't have enough hair on them.

01:10:11.357 --> 01:10:12.858
That's not what I meant.

01:10:14.652 --> 01:10:16.696
I know what you meant.

01:10:16.862 --> 01:10:18.531
How you feeling about it?

01:10:19.198 --> 01:10:21.117
I guess, um...

01:10:22.618 --> 01:10:23.786
I feel like...

01:10:25.538 --> 01:10:26.539
Like we...

01:10:28.165 --> 01:10:31.502
- Holy fuck.
- The power's on. Did you do this?

01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:33.671
How did this happen?
I burned the bills.

01:10:33.838 --> 01:10:35.298
How could we have done that?

01:10:35.464 --> 01:10:37.049
- The water.
- The water.

01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:40.303
Come on, come on, come on.

01:10:40.469 --> 01:10:41.804
Yeah!

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:44.682
- We can shower in our home again.
- We are liquid.

01:10:50.563 --> 01:10:51.564
Greetings.

01:10:51.731 --> 01:10:55.067
Have you heard the good news about
our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ?

01:10:55.234 --> 01:10:56.902
Oh, my God, did you guys do this?

01:10:57.069 --> 01:10:59.905
We got tired of you taking showers
at our places all the time.

01:11:00.072 --> 01:11:02.199
So we took up a collection
amongst ourselves.

01:11:02.366 --> 01:11:04.243
And chipped away
at your mountain of debt.

01:11:04.410 --> 01:11:06.537
You guys paid off
our massive utilities bills?

01:11:06.704 --> 01:11:09.749
- How did you afford that?
- I stole my old lady's bingo winnings.

01:11:09.915 --> 01:11:12.293
And Mistress Bubbles
did a bachelor party tonight

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.714
at which yours truly was a guest star,
thank you very much.

01:11:17.174 --> 01:11:20.927
Don't get too excited. We didn't pay off
your whole bill. Just a month of each.

01:11:21.094 --> 01:11:23.013
They agreed
to turn everything back on?

01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:24.890
At 9 at night? How does that work?

01:11:25.057 --> 01:11:27.809
Stacey knows somebody
that works at Power and Light.

01:11:27.976 --> 01:11:29.936
- You guys...
- This is amazing.

01:11:30.103 --> 01:11:31.605
You didn't have to do this.

01:11:31.772 --> 01:11:33.607
You didn't have to put us
in your movie.

01:11:33.774 --> 01:11:35.650
- Or let us shoot it.
- Or produce it.

01:11:35.817 --> 01:11:38.445
- Or put us in your movie either.
- We said that already.

01:11:38.612 --> 01:11:40.781
Guys, honestly,
I don't know what to say.

01:11:40.947 --> 01:11:43.075
You can start by saying
we can take tonight off

01:11:43.241 --> 01:11:45.452
so we can have our wrap party
right now.

01:11:45.619 --> 01:11:48.789
Guys, we're not wrapped.
We still have four days of shooting left.

01:11:48.955 --> 01:11:51.625
Excuse me.
In my "producorial" capacity,

01:11:51.792 --> 01:11:55.545
I'm shutting the movie down for a night
so we can get a little silly.

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.674
Go, go, go.

01:12:40.841 --> 01:12:42.884
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:12:44.428 --> 01:12:45.720
You all drink.

01:12:45.887 --> 01:12:49.349
Was it just amazing with him,
after all those years of not knowing?

01:12:49.516 --> 01:12:52.727
It was, um, weird.

01:12:53.645 --> 01:12:55.981
- But good.
- My scene with Zack's tomorrow.

01:12:56.148 --> 01:12:57.524
You don't say.

01:12:57.691 --> 01:13:02.362
But I'm a little nervous. I was thinking
about trying to get with him tonight.

01:13:02.529 --> 01:13:05.073
- Really?
- I mean, if you don't mind.

01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:08.452
You are just friends and all,
so I didn't think it would be a biggie.

01:13:08.618 --> 01:13:10.871
- It wouldn't be a biggie, would it?
- No.

01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:15.834
No, no. It's not a biggie. What? No.

01:13:16.001 --> 01:13:17.544
Are you sure?

01:13:17.711 --> 01:13:20.380
Yeah. Stacey,
I'm not married to the guy, so...

01:13:20.547 --> 01:13:25.552
I don't know. You guys just looked
kind of intimate last night.

01:13:25.719 --> 01:13:28.221
- We did?
- Yeah.

01:13:32.517 --> 01:13:38.565
Well, we're just better actors than
I thought, I think, so you know what?

01:13:38.732 --> 01:13:41.902
If you wanna get with him,
you should just go ask him.

01:13:42.068 --> 01:13:45.822
- He'd be really excited to hear that.
- Yeah? For real, you don't mind?

01:13:45.989 --> 01:13:49.034
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:13:53.288 --> 01:13:56.208
All the quarters are on the ground.

01:13:56.917 --> 01:13:59.711
Hey, Stace.
- Hey, Zack.

01:14:05.008 --> 01:14:07.677
Come on,
are you guys playing or what?

01:15:48.529 --> 01:15:51.032
Well, I'm bummed, but I totally get it.

01:15:51.198 --> 01:15:54.410
It's no problem to work
with Lester again. He has a nice cock.

01:15:54.577 --> 01:15:56.245
Well, you're a trouper, Stace.

01:15:56.412 --> 01:15:59.707
Oh, but if I start making weird faces
or anything during the scene,

01:15:59.874 --> 01:16:02.460
it's just because
I've been constipated all day.

01:16:02.627 --> 01:16:05.588
Oh, shit, uh. We don't have
to shoot the scene tonight.

01:16:05.755 --> 01:16:08.341
No, I want to. Anal's great
for when you're constipated.

01:16:08.507 --> 01:16:10.843
It totally loosens you up.

01:16:11.552 --> 01:16:14.388
I use ex-lax, but good to know.

01:16:14.555 --> 01:16:18.059
Okay, I never thought
I would have that conversation.

01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:20.519
So are we starting
with Lester and Stacey tonight?

01:16:20.686 --> 01:16:22.563
We were supposed to start
with Lester and Miri.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:25.566
I know. She... We're not gonna do that.
I don't think Miri's gonna...

01:16:33.491 --> 01:16:35.076
...do that.

01:16:37.870 --> 01:16:41.582
Hey. So where are we shooting this?
Over here?

01:16:42.333 --> 01:16:45.211
- What are you doing here?
- Me and Lester.

01:16:46.587 --> 01:16:48.714
Our scene's tonight, right?

01:16:50.758 --> 01:16:53.302
Can I talk to you for a minute
in the back?

01:16:53.803 --> 01:16:56.931
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:16:58.641 --> 01:17:00.351
What do you want me to shoot here?

01:17:00.518 --> 01:17:03.938
Start with the close-ups of Lester
and Stacey. Give me a second, man.

01:17:04.647 --> 01:17:05.731
What an artist.

01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:10.236
Okay, uh. Did I do something
wrong to you?

01:17:10.403 --> 01:17:11.445
No.

01:17:12.113 --> 01:17:13.239
Then why are you here?

01:17:13.406 --> 01:17:16.617
I'm here for the same reason
you're here. To make the movie.

01:17:17.284 --> 01:17:20.788
Okay, just, like,
for your own personal information,

01:17:21.664 --> 01:17:23.541
you're acting really weird right now.

01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:26.293
I'm acting weird?
I think you're acting weird right now.

01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:28.671
Oh, I'm acting...
How exactly am I acting weird?

01:17:28.838 --> 01:17:31.507
You've been trying to keep me
from fucking anybody but you

01:17:31.674 --> 01:17:33.634
since we started this thing.

01:17:34.301 --> 01:17:37.263
Maybe I was thinking
about your feelings.

01:17:37.430 --> 01:17:40.307
Were you thinking of my feelings
when you were banging Stacey?

01:17:40.474 --> 01:17:42.810
Because that'd be really sad
for Stacey.

01:17:42.977 --> 01:17:45.813
She told me that you told her that
that was okay.

01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:51.110
I told her that it was okay to ask you.

01:17:52.945 --> 01:17:57.283
Holy shit. I get it. I fucking get it.

01:17:57.450 --> 01:18:00.494
It was a test. That whole thing
was a fucking test, is that it?

01:18:01.412 --> 01:18:03.497
If it was, how do you think you did?

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:05.541
We had a discussion, Miri.

01:18:05.708 --> 01:18:11.964
We had... Actually, we had many
discussions about how it was just sex

01:18:12.131 --> 01:18:15.009
- and how we wouldn't let it get weird.
- I'm not acting weird.

01:18:15.176 --> 01:18:18.971
You're acting like a jealous girlfriend
is what the fuck you're acting like.

01:18:19.138 --> 01:18:21.015
- I am not your girlfriend.
- I know that.

01:18:21.182 --> 01:18:24.935
You're not my boyfriend, so why are
we having this conversation right now?

01:18:25.102 --> 01:18:29.190
Because you're about to fuck Lester
to spite me, it seems like.

01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:31.734
Did you fuck Stacey to spite me? No.

01:18:31.901 --> 01:18:34.111
You fucked her
like you fucked every other bitch

01:18:34.278 --> 01:18:36.363
and never gave a shit
how I felt about it.

01:18:36.864 --> 01:18:39.158
- Well, that was before.
- Before what?

01:18:39.325 --> 01:18:43.662
Look, don't fucking pretend that the
other night, you and me, right there,

01:18:43.829 --> 01:18:46.957
that that didn't mean anything to you,
that you didn't feel it too.

01:18:47.124 --> 01:18:51.545
Oh. You're not getting all gooey
on me here, are you, Zack?

01:18:51.879 --> 01:18:53.297
You know what?

01:18:53.464 --> 01:18:56.425
If you were any other bitch
I didn't give a rat's ass about,

01:18:56.592 --> 01:18:58.719
I would tell you
to go fuck yourself right now

01:18:58.886 --> 01:19:02.348
because I fucking hate
this game-playing shit.

01:19:02.515 --> 01:19:04.517
But you,
you mean more to me than that,

01:19:04.683 --> 01:19:07.061
so I'm just gonna lay this out
on front street.

01:19:07.228 --> 01:19:10.397
I know you felt something big,
something real the other night

01:19:10.564 --> 01:19:13.275
when we were together
because I felt it too.

01:19:13.442 --> 01:19:18.155
We tried to fuck and instead,
we wound up making love.

01:19:18.322 --> 01:19:21.910
So if this is what you need to hear in
order to keep you from fucking Lester,

01:19:22.077 --> 01:19:27.499
if this is what you need, then fine.
Here it is, I'm gonna say it.

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:30.001
I love you, Miri.

01:19:34.256 --> 01:19:35.715
Happy?

01:19:36.550 --> 01:19:37.801
Oh, Jesus.

01:19:37.968 --> 01:19:40.929
You better get ahold of yourself, Zack,
because we just fucked.

01:19:42.639 --> 01:19:44.349
Okay.

01:19:50.939 --> 01:19:53.275
What if I didn't fuck Stacey?

01:19:54.234 --> 01:19:55.861
But you did.

01:19:56.027 --> 01:19:59.906
You know what?
I don't fucking give a shit.

01:20:00.782 --> 01:20:02.450
Wait...

01:20:07.122 --> 01:20:10.917
All right, don't forget I'm down here.
Watch that pullout, huh?

01:20:11.084 --> 01:20:12.836
Yeah.

01:20:13.003 --> 01:20:16.798
Mmm.
This is some damn good coffee.

01:20:16.965 --> 01:20:19.301
- Where you going?
- Getting the fuck out of here.

01:20:19.467 --> 01:20:21.094
We gotta finish this movie.

01:20:27.058 --> 01:20:28.393
Yo!

01:20:32.063 --> 01:20:33.982
You believe this shit?

01:20:34.149 --> 01:20:35.525
Do you believe this shit?

01:20:35.692 --> 01:20:37.402
What the fuck just happened
in there?

01:20:37.569 --> 01:20:39.571
I'll tell you what
just happened in there.

01:20:39.738 --> 01:20:42.407
That chick frosted me
like I was a fucking cake.

01:21:00.508 --> 01:21:02.260
Zack.

01:21:19.152 --> 01:21:21.529
Okay, seriously,
get a picture of me right now.

01:21:22.072 --> 01:21:24.199
I'm hunting humans.

01:21:24.366 --> 01:21:27.369
- Dude, check it out. Ooh.
- Oh, shit.

01:21:27.535 --> 01:21:29.829
Seriously,
let's shoot the shit out of this bitch.

01:21:29.996 --> 01:21:32.707
- Where you aiming at?
- Cock shots?

01:21:32.874 --> 01:21:34.209
Cock shots.

01:21:48.348 --> 01:21:50.684
We shot you in the balls, cunt nugget.

01:21:51.184 --> 01:21:54.688
Well, it's my job to get shot in the balls,
so... oh, they're gone.

01:21:54.854 --> 01:21:55.897
Excuse me.

01:21:56.064 --> 01:21:58.316
Didn't you used to work at
the Bean-N-Gone in Monroeville?

01:21:59.651 --> 01:22:03.863
I sure as shit hope this pays better,
I tell you.

01:22:07.575 --> 01:22:10.078
So why don't they just shoot you
with a puck?

01:22:10.245 --> 01:22:11.287
What do you mean?

01:22:11.454 --> 01:22:15.208
I mean, what does paintball
got to do with hockey?

01:22:16.001 --> 01:22:17.669
Nothing, I guess.

01:22:17.836 --> 01:22:20.463
- So ain't no prizes or...?
- No, no.

01:22:20.630 --> 01:22:22.590
So, what are they paying $5 for?

01:22:22.757 --> 01:22:25.885
To shoot a Broad Street Bully
in the balls.

01:22:27.429 --> 01:22:29.347
White people are fucked up.

01:22:30.181 --> 01:22:31.516
Yup, they sure are.

01:22:31.683 --> 01:22:34.602
It's a living. You've been getting
the checks I've been sending?

01:22:34.769 --> 01:22:36.938
Yes, thank you very much.
I appreciate that.

01:22:37.605 --> 01:22:41.693
Probably didn't save you from a
brutal tongue-lashing, though, huh?

01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:45.280
You know, the wife
never found out about the camera,

01:22:45.447 --> 01:22:47.198
because I paid off the bills.

01:22:47.365 --> 01:22:48.908
How did you manage that?

01:22:49.409 --> 01:22:53.163
- Because now I'm Oprah rich.
- No way.

01:22:53.329 --> 01:22:56.458
- The post office fucking settled?
- Hundred-sixty large, son.

01:22:56.624 --> 01:23:00.587
- Nice, man. Congratulations.
- A beautiful day, thank you very much.

01:23:00.754 --> 01:23:02.547
I thought
you made that whole thing up.

01:23:02.714 --> 01:23:03.965
No, no. It was very real.

01:23:04.132 --> 01:23:06.134
You can believe it.

01:23:06.468 --> 01:23:08.803
Even though she's spending all of it.

01:23:13.933 --> 01:23:17.062
Well, since you ain't gonna ask me,
I'll just go ahead and tell you.

01:23:17.228 --> 01:23:20.940
- No, I have not seen Miri.
- I wasn't gonna ask that.

01:23:21.107 --> 01:23:24.153
Oh, I suppose you weren't gonna ask
about your movie, neither?

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:27.656
Look, that's why I came down here.
I need you to come take a look at it.

01:23:27.823 --> 01:23:30.534
- I'm not interested. Sorry.
- You'd better get interested

01:23:30.701 --> 01:23:33.746
- because you still owe me money.
- What's wrong with the movie?

01:23:33.913 --> 01:23:36.791
The story doesn't make sense.

01:23:36.957 --> 01:23:39.543
- The story?
- The story doesn't make sense.

01:23:39.710 --> 01:23:42.338
It's a fucking porno movie, man.
What story?

01:23:42.505 --> 01:23:45.674
It's a movie, dog,
and a movie's gotta have an ending,

01:23:45.841 --> 01:23:47.468
which we don't have at the moment.

01:23:47.635 --> 01:23:50.513
Come shot, credits.
There's your fucking ending.

01:23:50.679 --> 01:23:52.389
Do me this favor, okay?

01:23:52.556 --> 01:23:55.226
When you're done
getting your nuts blown off,

01:23:55.392 --> 01:24:00.147
come back to humble Monroeville
to my crib for a couple hours,

01:24:00.314 --> 01:24:03.776
check out the flick,
you tell me what's missing.

01:24:04.735 --> 01:24:05.861
No.

01:24:06.112 --> 01:24:09.532
I'll tell you what, you do that,
you don't owe me shit no more.

01:24:09.698 --> 01:24:11.867
- Really?
- Really.

01:24:12.034 --> 01:24:14.286
- Is your wife home?
- Yes.

01:24:15.371 --> 01:24:19.542
- Maybe I should leave the pads on.
- You got some extra ones?

01:24:32.054 --> 01:24:33.139
Hey, honey.

01:24:33.305 --> 01:24:35.975
Where the fuck you been?
And who in the fuck is this now?

01:24:36.392 --> 01:24:38.060
Would you calm down, woman?
Goddamn.

01:24:38.227 --> 01:24:40.688
You already left one white boy
down in my basement

01:24:40.855 --> 01:24:43.732
while you off gallivanting and shit.
What if this motherfucker

01:24:43.899 --> 01:24:47.236
- was all grabby on me?
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.

01:24:47.403 --> 01:24:50.239
Oh, what in the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

01:24:50.406 --> 01:24:53.325
- Ain't nobody wanna grab on you.
- White boys love me.

01:24:53.659 --> 01:24:54.702
White boy.

01:24:56.203 --> 01:24:58.247
- I said, white boy.
- Yeah?

01:24:58.414 --> 01:24:59.832
You'd fuck me, wouldn't you?

01:25:00.499 --> 01:25:02.084
- Should I say yes?
- Just say yes.

01:25:02.251 --> 01:25:03.919
Yeah.

01:25:07.089 --> 01:25:10.301
- Why don't you, uh, head downstairs?
- Oh, okay.

01:25:10.467 --> 01:25:11.969
It's just through this hallway.

01:25:12.136 --> 01:25:14.180
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

01:25:16.765 --> 01:25:18.267
What the fuck you looking at?

01:25:18.434 --> 01:25:20.936
Why you gotta be yelling at me
in front of my director?

01:25:21.103 --> 01:25:22.438
- Oh, he's a director?
- Yeah.

01:25:22.605 --> 01:25:24.607
I didn't know that.
Shit, he's a director.

01:25:24.773 --> 01:25:28.694
Well, why don't he direct my ass to a
new husband? How about that shit?

01:25:28.861 --> 01:25:31.280
- That's the bedroom.
- Keep talking, maybe he will.

01:25:31.447 --> 01:25:33.490
Oh, don't nobody
want them saggy-ass balls!

01:25:33.657 --> 01:25:36.744
Saggy balls? Look at these
sagging-ass titties you got around here.

01:25:36.911 --> 01:25:39.538
- You could tie these together.
- Motherfucker, we match.

01:25:43.125 --> 01:25:44.585
Oh, shit.

01:25:45.753 --> 01:25:47.755
Where's my paintball gun at?

01:25:47.922 --> 01:25:50.633
Look at you, editor and DP.
You got your shit covered, man.

01:25:50.799 --> 01:25:54.887
Please, don't ever say "shit-covered"
to me again.

01:25:56.305 --> 01:26:00.100
Roll the film for the man, please,
so we can see what he thinks.

01:26:00.267 --> 01:26:03.437
Just jump through it. I ain't
got all night. The bitch is on me.

01:26:04.813 --> 01:26:07.608
"Nigga Rich Productions." Classy.

01:26:07.775 --> 01:26:10.236
- Yeah, DreamWorks was taken.
- Was it?

01:26:10.402 --> 01:26:13.072
Plus, it sounds like an underground
gay fuck club.

01:26:13.239 --> 01:26:14.949
"I met a guy at DreamWorks." Yeah.

01:26:15.115 --> 01:26:19.495
All right, so we got
Lester and Stacey fucking.

01:26:19.662 --> 01:26:21.455
Then we got
Barry and Bubbles fucking.

01:26:22.831 --> 01:26:25.084
And then this boring bullshit.

01:26:30.172 --> 01:26:33.550
Okay, just, uh, go to the next scene,
would you?

01:26:36.136 --> 01:26:39.306
- What next scene?
- The one with Miri and Lester?

01:26:39.473 --> 01:26:41.392
We never shot it.

01:26:42.017 --> 01:26:44.520
- Why not?
- Because after you left that night,

01:26:44.687 --> 01:26:47.606
Miri came out of the backroom
and said she couldn't do it.

01:26:47.773 --> 01:26:51.777
- We wrapped after that.
- Wrapped? So...

01:26:53.153 --> 01:26:56.198
- Wait, so Miri...
- Never fucked nobody.

01:26:56.365 --> 01:26:57.449
Just you.

01:26:59.034 --> 01:27:02.705
Now, I wonder why she did that.

01:27:06.375 --> 01:27:10.796
You see, there was a time when I was
just a bitter old fuck making coffees,

01:27:10.963 --> 01:27:12.923
and Stacey was just a lap dancer

01:27:13.090 --> 01:27:15.092
and Barry and Bubbles
didn't know each other

01:27:15.259 --> 01:27:18.554
and this fool here,
hell, I don't even know what he was.

01:27:18.721 --> 01:27:21.807
- A white supremacist.
- Man, fuck you.

01:27:21.974 --> 01:27:23.809
Then two people come along

01:27:23.976 --> 01:27:27.188
and showed us something
we didn't know existed.

01:27:27.355 --> 01:27:32.360
A world of possibilities
where plain old people just like us

01:27:32.527 --> 01:27:34.779
could do something special.

01:27:34.946 --> 01:27:38.700
Even if it's something as simple
as filming people fucking.

01:27:49.544 --> 01:27:52.839
Sometimes we just need someone

01:27:53.006 --> 01:27:57.010
to show us something
we can't see for ourselves

01:27:59.637 --> 01:28:02.057
and then we're changed forever.

01:28:13.276 --> 01:28:16.529
So as you can see,
our movie ain't got no ending.

01:28:18.114 --> 01:28:20.158
Every movie needs an ending,
don't it?

01:28:24.871 --> 01:28:25.914
Peace.

01:28:28.416 --> 01:28:32.170
Delaney,
you're a slick cupid motherfucker.

01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:34.506
Ain't love grand?

01:28:34.672 --> 01:28:37.717
Why the fuck is this white boy
running through my goddamn house?

01:28:39.094 --> 01:28:40.804
Sometimes.

01:28:53.775 --> 01:28:55.402
Miri.

01:28:56.111 --> 01:28:58.530
- Miri.
- Zack?

01:28:59.697 --> 01:29:01.157
Miri. I'm sorry.
- Get out.

01:29:01.324 --> 01:29:02.826
- Close the door.
- It was closed.

01:29:02.992 --> 01:29:06.204
- It was closed over...
- Just close the fucking door, Zack.

01:29:06.371 --> 01:29:11.042
I never slept with Stacey that night,
okay? I swear to God.

01:29:11.209 --> 01:29:13.336
When we got into my room,
you know what we did?

01:29:13.503 --> 01:29:18.091
We talked about you, and us
and how things were different

01:29:18.258 --> 01:29:21.261
and how I was
too much of a fucking pussy

01:29:21.428 --> 01:29:24.013
to just tell you how I felt about you.

01:29:24.722 --> 01:29:29.102
And I know... I know that that's only
because of all the stupid shit we said

01:29:29.269 --> 01:29:34.566
about how we wouldn't let sex
change us, but it did. It changed me.

01:29:35.358 --> 01:29:37.819
That has to be love, right?

01:29:38.111 --> 01:29:40.405
It has to be love

01:29:40.905 --> 01:29:45.034
and just so you know, I can't go back
to being just friends anymore,

01:29:46.369 --> 01:29:48.204
- because I just can't.
- Good.

01:29:48.371 --> 01:29:50.331
And I think...

01:29:51.666 --> 01:29:53.293
I think that you feel the same way.

01:29:54.127 --> 01:29:59.048
Because that night after I left,
you didn't fuck Lester.

01:30:02.552 --> 01:30:04.387
What's up, Zack?

01:30:14.772 --> 01:30:15.815
You know what?

01:30:15.982 --> 01:30:18.693
I don't care that you're fucking
Lester, okay? How's that?

01:30:18.860 --> 01:30:21.571
- Oh, shit.
- I don't wanna be with anyone but you.

01:30:21.738 --> 01:30:26.534
So I will wait forever for you, okay?
I will wait the rest of my life

01:30:26.701 --> 01:30:29.996
because I love you, and I have
for as long as I can remember.

01:30:30.622 --> 01:30:33.875
And I would rather die
than be without you, Miriam Linky.

01:30:34.042 --> 01:30:35.668
Miri's last name is Linky?

01:30:36.503 --> 01:30:39.088
You're gonna fuck a guy
who doesn't know your last name?

01:30:39.255 --> 01:30:42.091
Or that you beat up Carl Roth
in the sixth grade? I know that.

01:30:42.258 --> 01:30:45.178
Or what your senior prom dress
would've looked like had we gone

01:30:45.345 --> 01:30:48.264
but we decided not to,
and we got drunk alone instead.

01:30:48.431 --> 01:30:50.433
Or that you washed your hair
in the toilet.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:51.768
We're not fucking, Zack.

01:30:51.935 --> 01:30:53.853
Or that you're not fucking Zack...
What?

01:30:54.020 --> 01:30:56.105
I asked her to fuck me.
She wouldn't do it.

01:30:56.272 --> 01:30:59.275
I even tried to talk her into giving me
the fucking Dutch rudder.

01:30:59.442 --> 01:31:01.152
Shot me down on that too.

01:31:02.278 --> 01:31:05.281
- And a Dutch rudder is?
- Don't know what a Dutch rudder...?

01:31:05.448 --> 01:31:06.950
All right, you grab your dick,

01:31:07.116 --> 01:31:09.160
then you have someone else
work your arm.

01:31:09.327 --> 01:31:10.620
Here, let me show you.

01:31:10.787 --> 01:31:13.957
All right, grab my arm. I'm grabbing
my dick, you're grabbing my arm.

01:31:14.123 --> 01:31:17.293
Now work it. Work my arm.
See that shit? Work it up and down.

01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:19.504
It's like someone else
is jerking you off.

01:31:19.671 --> 01:31:20.713
Okay.

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:22.507
There's the double Dutch rudder,

01:31:22.674 --> 01:31:24.968
which, I grab my dick,
you grab your dick,

01:31:25.134 --> 01:31:27.721
you work my arm, I work your arm,
same time.

01:31:27.888 --> 01:31:30.266
It's like jerking off together
but not gay.

01:31:30.432 --> 01:31:32.935
We're not touching dicks,
each other's dicks anyway.

01:31:33.102 --> 01:31:36.021
I'm touching my own dick.
You're working it, and I'm loving it.

01:31:36.188 --> 01:31:39.108
It feels good, sir. Try me, come on.

01:31:39.275 --> 01:31:41.860
Sorry to change the subject on you,
Lester,

01:31:42.027 --> 01:31:47.700
but if you're not fucking Miri,
why is your dick out right now?

01:31:47.866 --> 01:31:50.911
Because I live here now,
and I like to be naked.

01:31:51.495 --> 01:31:52.997
- What?
- When you moved out,

01:31:53.163 --> 01:31:56.584
she couldn't afford to pay her rent
by herself, so I moved in to help.

01:31:56.959 --> 01:31:58.836
But you just came out of her room.

01:31:59.003 --> 01:32:01.171
That's my room now.
She moved in your old room.

01:32:01.338 --> 01:32:04.008
Wait, wait, wait. She changed rooms?

01:32:04.174 --> 01:32:07.845
Yeah, she said she did it because she
missed the smell of you or some shit.

01:32:10.180 --> 01:32:11.932
I don't smell anything.

01:32:12.099 --> 01:32:15.019
But you know what?
That probably means she loves you.

01:32:16.854 --> 01:32:19.898
- Night, Zack.
- Night.

01:32:24.194 --> 01:32:25.321
Do you?

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:29.450
Then why are you crying?

01:32:30.284 --> 01:32:32.745
Because I missed you so much.

01:32:33.537 --> 01:32:35.205
Me too.

01:32:36.457 --> 01:32:38.500
I love you.

01:32:42.588 --> 01:32:44.381
- I love you, I love you.
- I love you.

01:32:44.548 --> 01:32:46.050
I don't mean to alarm you

01:32:46.216 --> 01:32:48.719
but I think I just jerked off Lester
a little bit.

01:32:49.803 --> 01:32:52.139
- The Dutch rudder?
- Yeah, it's ingenious, right?

01:32:52.306 --> 01:32:55.684
If you ask me nicely, I will
Dutch-rudder you the rest of our lives.

01:32:55.851 --> 01:32:59.229
Good. I'm getting tired
of fucking the Fleshlight.

01:32:59.396 --> 01:33:00.773
- You fucked it?
- Yeah.

01:33:00.939 --> 01:33:03.484
- What'd it feel like?
- Like fucking a flashlight.

01:33:04.068 --> 01:33:08.030
Wrong room.
- Oh, God. That's gross.

01:33:09.239 --> 01:33:11.909
Let us fuck.

01:36:11.589 --> 01:36:14.092
Hello.
Welcome to Nigga Rich Productions,

01:36:14.259 --> 01:36:17.136
home of
Zack and Miri Make Your Porno,

01:36:17.303 --> 01:36:19.055
the production house for the couple

01:36:19.222 --> 01:36:21.850
looking to put a little spice
in their sex life.

01:36:22.016 --> 01:36:25.478
- Shall we take a look around?
- Fuck me so hard. Oh, God.

01:36:25.645 --> 01:36:29.607
First, you'll meet for a consultation
with one of our romance-ologists,

01:36:29.774 --> 01:36:32.277
who'll coach you
through that initial awkward stage

01:36:32.443 --> 01:36:33.987
before you're camera-ready.

01:36:34.153 --> 01:36:38.700
So we will start off
with some erotic massage and some...

01:36:38.867 --> 01:36:41.828
Dude. Some light petting.

01:36:41.995 --> 01:36:43.538
That sounds good.

01:36:43.705 --> 01:36:47.625
Are you guys sure you don't wanna do
some, uh, butt-sack work too?

01:36:47.792 --> 01:36:49.836
- Uh, let's move on, shall we?
- Why?

01:36:50.003 --> 01:36:52.297
From their break-out hit,
Swallow My Cockuccino,

01:36:52.463 --> 01:36:54.924
to the multi-million selling
Swallow My Cockuccino II

01:36:55.091 --> 01:36:57.176
and the award-winning
Star Whores saga,

01:36:57.343 --> 01:37:00.305
including Revenge of the Shit:
The All-Anal Final Chapter,

01:37:00.471 --> 01:37:02.307
Zack and Miri have proven
time and again

01:37:02.473 --> 01:37:05.226
that they know how to shoot hot sex.

01:37:06.185 --> 01:37:12.901
As an actor, I've sometimes brought
my work home with me inappropriately.

01:37:13.067 --> 01:37:17.488
When you're telling your real-life lover
in the bedroom,

01:37:17.655 --> 01:37:20.241
to, you know, bend over
while you cake your hand in K-Y,

01:37:20.408 --> 01:37:22.911
it is a sign that the romance is dead,
I think.

01:37:23.077 --> 01:37:26.581
Then we turned to the professionals
at Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.

01:37:26.748 --> 01:37:29.876
Oh, my God,
they totally saved our civil union.

01:37:30.043 --> 01:37:32.503
They filmed what was inside of us

01:37:32.670 --> 01:37:35.256
and not what was coming out of us
necessarily.

01:37:35.423 --> 01:37:37.842
It helped me see his asshole

01:37:38.009 --> 01:37:42.722
as not just a come dumpster,

01:37:42.889 --> 01:37:46.351
but a sign of his beauty, his flower.

01:37:46.517 --> 01:37:50.188
It became a, uh, gorgeous orchid.

01:37:50.355 --> 01:37:54.525
Orchids grow
in sort of the filthiest conditions.

01:37:54.692 --> 01:38:01.324
That's what his asshole became to me.
This beautiful flower amidst shit.

01:38:01.491 --> 01:38:04.035
- Honey, they get the metaphor.
- I don't think they do.

01:38:04.202 --> 01:38:06.996
Let's just say,
thank you to Zack and Miri.

01:38:07.163 --> 01:38:09.749
It's helped us out,
it's helped our friends.

01:38:09.916 --> 01:38:12.085
Enrique? Park?

01:38:12.251 --> 01:38:15.338
Park? Enrique?

01:38:15.546 --> 01:38:18.883
Can we get a little love
for Zack and Miri?

01:38:20.051 --> 01:38:23.638
They don't even know what's going on,
they're so pilled up.

01:38:24.263 --> 01:38:28.226
But don't take his word for it.
Just ask our co-founders.

01:38:28.935 --> 01:38:32.105
- Hi. I'm Miri Linky Brown.
- I'm Zack Linky Brown.

01:38:32.271 --> 01:38:35.149
Here at Zack and Miri
Make Your Porno, we're dedicated

01:38:35.316 --> 01:38:37.318
- to committing your love...
- Or lust.

01:38:37.485 --> 01:38:40.571
- to high-end, quality production
digital video.

01:38:40.738 --> 01:38:42.824
A forever keepsake of your passion.

01:38:42.991 --> 01:38:45.952
That's right, Miri. Why set up a camera
at the end of your bed

01:38:46.119 --> 01:38:48.788
and settle for one unflattering angle,

01:38:48.955 --> 01:38:52.166
when you could let the professionals
dazzle and delight your senses

01:38:52.333 --> 01:38:55.086
with an array of shots
so masterfully rendered

01:38:55.253 --> 01:38:57.672
you'll swear
Martin Scorsese snuck into your room

01:38:57.839 --> 01:38:59.549
and caught you fucking?

01:38:59.716 --> 01:39:01.926
And remember,
we're not just the presidents

01:39:02.093 --> 01:39:04.262
of Zack and Miri Make Your Porno.
