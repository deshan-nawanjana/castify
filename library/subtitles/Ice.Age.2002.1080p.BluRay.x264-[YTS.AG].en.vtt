00:04:46.067 --> 00:04:49.696
Why not call it
the Big Chill or the Nippy era?

2
00:04:49.821 --> 00:04:52.824
I'm just sayin',
how do we know it's an Ice age?

3
00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.618
Because of all the ice.

4
00:04:58.121 --> 00:05:00.581
Well, things just got a little chillier.

5
00:05:00.707 --> 00:05:04.252
Help. Help.

6
00:05:04.377 --> 00:05:07.672
Come on, kids, let's go. The traffic's movin'.

7
00:05:08.047 --> 00:05:10.049
But, but, but, Dad.

8
00:05:10.216 --> 00:05:12.927
No buts. You can play extinction later.

9
00:05:13.302 --> 00:05:16.681
OK. Come on, guys.

10
00:05:16.973 --> 00:05:19.017
So, where's Eddie?

11
00:05:19.142 --> 00:05:22.895
He said he was on the verge
of an evolutionary breakthrough.

12
00:05:23.021 --> 00:05:25.064
Really?

13
00:05:25.606 --> 00:05:28.276
I'm flying.

14
00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:31.696
Some breakthrough.

15
00:05:32.822 --> 00:05:35.366
- Look out.
- You're going the wrong way.

16
00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:38.453
Crazy mammoth.

17
00:05:45.293 --> 00:05:49.964
Do the world a favour.
Move your issues off the road.

18
00:05:50.381 --> 00:05:54.594
If my trunk was that small,
I wouldn't draw attention to myself, pal.

19
00:05:54.802 --> 00:05:58.389
Give me a break.
We've been waddlin' all day.

20
00:06:00.224 --> 00:06:02.935
Go ahead. Follow the crowd.

21
00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:05.271
It'll be quieter when you're gone.

22
00:06:06.606 --> 00:06:09.400
Come on. If he wants to
freeze to death, let him.

23
00:06:19.452 --> 00:06:21.537
I'm up. I'm up.

24
00:06:23.998 --> 00:06:29.295
Rise and shine, everybody.
Huh? Zak? Marshall?

25
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.131
Bertie? Uncle Fungus?

26
00:06:32.799 --> 00:06:38.971
Where is everybody? Come on, guys,
we're gonna miss the migration.

27
00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:45.937
They left without me.
They do this every year.

28
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.942
Why? Doesn't anyone love me?

29
00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:55.697
Isn't there anyone who cares
about Sid the Sloth?

30
00:06:58.408 --> 00:07:00.535
All right, I'll just go by myself.

31
00:07:03.162 --> 00:07:04.789
Sick.

32
00:07:04.914 --> 00:07:07.625
Wide body, kerb it next time.

33
00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:10.211
Oh, jeez. Yuck.

34
00:07:10.503 --> 00:07:16.092
I can't believe it. Fresh wild greens.
Frank, where did you ever...?

35
00:07:16.217 --> 00:07:19.345
- Go ahead. Dig in.
- A dandelion.

36
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:23.016
- I thought the frost wiped 'em all out.
- All but one.

37
00:07:24.475 --> 00:07:28.271
It makes me so... I wanna... Yuck.

38
00:07:28.396 --> 00:07:33.109
This has definitely not been my day.
You know what I'm sayin', buddy?

39
00:07:33.234 --> 00:07:36.988
What a mess. You rhinos
have tiny brains. Did you know that?

40
00:07:37.113 --> 00:07:42.076
It's just a fact. No offence. You probably
didn't even know what I'm talkin' about.

41
00:07:42.827 --> 00:07:44.203
Yummo.

42
00:07:44.454 --> 00:07:47.373
A dandelion. Must be
the last one of the season.

43
00:07:50.501 --> 00:07:52.837
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

44
00:07:52.962 --> 00:07:55.006
He ruined our salad.

45
00:07:56.424 --> 00:07:59.177
My mistake. That was my mistake. Let me...

46
00:07:59.761 --> 00:08:03.556
No, no, seriously, let me
take care of this. What is this?

47
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:07.310
Pine cones. Oh, my goodness.
They're my favourite.

48
00:08:09.228 --> 00:08:13.691
Delicious. That's good eating.

49
00:08:13.983 --> 00:08:17.320
But don't let me hog them all up.
Here, you have some.

50
00:08:17.445 --> 00:08:20.198
<i>Tasty, isn't it? Bon app�tit.</i>

51
00:08:21.574 --> 00:08:23.701
Now?

52
00:08:24.202 --> 00:08:26.245
Now.

53
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:39.175
- Just pretend that I'm not here.
- I wanted to hit him at full speed.

54
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:44.555
- That's OK. We'll have some fun with him.
- Don't let them impale me. I wanna live.

55
00:08:44.681 --> 00:08:47.975
- Get off me.
- Come on, you're makin' a scene.

56
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:50.853
<i>We'll just take our furry pi�ata and go.</i>

57
00:08:50.978 --> 00:08:53.940
If it's not them today,
it's someone else tomorrow.

58
00:08:54.065 --> 00:08:56.442
Well, I'd rather it not be today. OK?

59
00:08:56.567 --> 00:08:59.904
We'll break your neck
so you don't feel a thing.

60
00:09:00.029 --> 00:09:03.116
Wait a minute. I thought
rhinos were vegetarians.

61
00:09:03.282 --> 00:09:05.326
- An excellent point.
- Shut up.

62
00:09:05.451 --> 00:09:09.080
Who says we're gonna eat him
after we kill him?

63
00:09:09.205 --> 00:09:12.083
I don't like animals that kill for pleasure.

64
00:09:12.208 --> 00:09:15.586
- Save it for a mammal that cares.
- I'm a mammal that cares.

65
00:09:15.878 --> 00:09:20.967
OK, if either of you make it across that
sinkhole in front of ya, you get the sloth.

66
00:09:21.092 --> 00:09:24.929
That's right, you losers.
You take one step and you're dead.

67
00:09:29.183 --> 00:09:32.729
- You were bluffing, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was a bluff.

68
00:09:33.938 --> 00:09:35.648
Get him.

69
00:10:11.726 --> 00:10:13.770
A dandelion?

70
00:10:16.647 --> 00:10:18.691
We did it.

71
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.953
- You have beautiful eyes.
- Get off my face.

72
00:10:32.205 --> 00:10:36.250
Whoa, we make a great team.
What do you say we head south together?

73
00:10:36.376 --> 00:10:38.836
Great. Jump on my back
and relax the whole way.

74
00:10:38.961 --> 00:10:40.963
- Wow, really?
- No.

75
00:10:41.255 --> 00:10:45.551
Wait, aren't you going south?
The change of seasons, migration instincts.

76
00:10:45.677 --> 00:10:48.388
- Any of this a-ringin' a bell?
- I guess not. Bye.

77
00:10:48.513 --> 00:10:51.391
OK, then. Thanks for the help.
I can take it from here.

78
00:10:52.392 --> 00:10:56.145
You overgrown weasel.
Wait till we get down there.

79
00:10:56.896 --> 00:11:00.692
That south thing is way overrated.
The heat, the crowds - who needs it?

80
00:11:00.817 --> 00:11:05.363
Isn't this great? You and me,
two bachelors knockin' about in the wild.

81
00:11:05.488 --> 00:11:09.283
No, you just want a bodyguard
so you don't become somebody's side dish.

82
00:11:09.409 --> 00:11:11.703
You're a very shrewd mammal.

83
00:11:11.828 --> 00:11:14.747
OK, lead the way, Mr Big...
Didn't get the name.

84
00:11:14.872 --> 00:11:16.874
- Manfred.
- Manfred? Yuck.

85
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.171
How about Manny the Moody Mammoth?
Or Manny the Melancholy... Manny the...

86
00:11:24.716 --> 00:11:26.759
Stop following me.

87
00:11:28.469 --> 00:11:34.267
OK, so you've got issues. You won't
even know I'm here. I'll just zip the lip.

88
00:12:18.353 --> 00:12:22.273
Look at the cute little baby, Diego.

89
00:12:24.692 --> 00:12:30.073
- Isn't it nice he'll be joining us for breaktast?
- It wouldn't be breaktast without him.

90
00:12:30.198 --> 00:12:35.953
Especially since his daddy wiped out half
our pack and wears our skin to keep warm.

91
00:12:36.079 --> 00:12:39.165
An eye for an eye, don't you think?

92
00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:42.835
Let's show him what happens
when he messes with sabres.

93
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:46.089
Alert the troops. We attack at dawn.

94
00:12:47.173 --> 00:12:51.761
And, Diego, bring me that baby alive.

95
00:12:51.886 --> 00:12:57.141
If I'm gonna enjoy my revenge,
I want it to be fresh.

96
00:13:18.579 --> 00:13:20.707
Phew. I'm wiped out.

97
00:13:21.124 --> 00:13:24.711
- That's your shelter?
- You're a big guy. You got a lotta wood.

98
00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:27.588
- I'm a little guy.
- You got half a stick.

99
00:13:27.714 --> 00:13:34.053
But with my little stick and my highly
evolved brain, I shall create fire.

100
00:13:34.512 --> 00:13:36.264
Fascinating.

101
00:13:36.639 --> 00:13:40.685
We'll see if brains triumph
over brawn tonight. Now, won't we?

102
00:13:46.733 --> 00:13:48.901
Think I saw a spark.

103
00:13:52.864 --> 00:13:56.451
Any chance I could squeeze
in there with you, Manny, ol' pal?

104
00:13:56.576 --> 00:13:59.078
Isn't there someone else you can annoy?

105
00:13:59.203 --> 00:14:02.707
Friends? Family? Poisonous reptiles?

106
00:14:03.124 --> 00:14:07.795
My family abandoned me.
They just kinda migrated without me.

107
00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:10.506
You should see what they did last year.

108
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:13.343
They woke up early and
tied my hands and feet

109
00:14:13.468 --> 00:14:16.220
and they gagged me with a fieldmouse,

110
00:14:16.346 --> 00:14:19.932
covered their tracks, went
through water so I'd lose their scent,

111
00:14:20.058 --> 00:14:22.852
and... who needs 'em, anyway?

112
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.734
So what about you? You have family?

113
00:14:33.988 --> 00:14:37.116
OK, you're tired. I see.
We'll talk more in the morning.

114
00:14:39.702 --> 00:14:43.206
Manfred? Manfred?
Could you scooch over a drop?

115
00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:47.377
Come on. Nobody falls asleep that fast.

116
00:14:47.502 --> 00:14:49.545
Manny.

117
00:17:40.425 --> 00:17:42.552
There's Diego. Fall back.

118
00:17:49.142 --> 00:17:51.978
- Where's the baby?
- I lost it over the falls.

119
00:17:52.228 --> 00:17:54.731
You lost it?

120
00:17:57.650 --> 00:18:00.194
- I want that baby, Diego.
- I'll get it.

121
00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:03.948
You'd better, unless you want to
serve as a replacement.

122
00:18:04.157 --> 00:18:07.410
We'll go up to Half Peak. Meet us there.

123
00:18:08.828 --> 00:18:10.872
It had better be alive.

124
00:18:12.206 --> 00:18:14.667
Can we trust you with that, Diego?

125
00:18:14.792 --> 00:18:17.253
Let's go.

126
00:18:40.026 --> 00:18:44.030
She picked a hair off my shoulder and says,
"If you have an extra mating dance,

127
00:18:44.155 --> 00:18:46.699
at least pick a female
with the same colour pelt. "

128
00:18:46.908 --> 00:18:50.286
I thought "Whoa. She's gonna go
praying mantis on me. "

129
00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:54.123
If you find a mate, you should be loyal.
In your case, grateful.

130
00:18:54.248 --> 00:18:57.502
- Now get away from me.
- I think mating for life is stupid.

131
00:18:57.627 --> 00:18:59.837
There's plenty of Sid to go around.

132
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:03.466
Manny?

133
00:19:04.092 --> 00:19:06.135
Manny?

134
00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:01.482
Look at that. He's OK.

135
00:20:13.745 --> 00:20:16.456
She's gone.

136
00:20:26.257 --> 00:20:29.635
- Manny, are you forgetting something?
- No.

137
00:20:29.802 --> 00:20:33.806
- But you just saved him.
- I'm trying to get rid of the last thing I saved.

138
00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:36.392
But you can't leave him here.

139
00:20:40.438 --> 00:20:43.941
Look, there's smoke.
That's his herd right up the hill.

140
00:20:44.233 --> 00:20:48.154
- We should return him.
- Let's get this straight. There is no "we".

141
00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:53.868
There never was a "we". In fact,
without me, there wouldn't even be a "you".

142
00:20:54.827 --> 00:21:01.668
- Just up the hill.
- Listen very carefully: I'm not going.

143
00:21:01.959 --> 00:21:06.839
- Fine, be ajerk. I'll take care of him.
- Yeah, that's good.

144
00:21:06.923 --> 00:21:10.343
You can't even take care of yourself.
This, I gotta see.

145
00:21:10.468 --> 00:21:14.722
I'll return you. We don't need
that meany-weeny mammoth, do we?

146
00:21:14.847 --> 00:21:16.933
No, we don't.

147
00:21:46.379 --> 00:21:49.757
You're an embarrassment to nature.
Do you know that?

148
00:21:50.383 --> 00:21:53.594
This is cake. I'm fine, I'm fine.

149
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.763
I'm gonna die.

150
00:22:09.193 --> 00:22:10.695
Manny.

151
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.379
- That pink thing is mine.
- No. Actually, that pink thing belongs to us.

152
00:22:31.466 --> 00:22:34.844
"Us"? You two are a bit of an odd couple.

153
00:22:34.969 --> 00:22:36.721
There is no "us".

154
00:22:36.846 --> 00:22:40.141
I see. Can't have one of your own,
so you want to adopt.

155
00:22:40.266 --> 00:22:43.353
Look, I'm sorry to interrupt
your snack, but we gotta go.

156
00:22:43.561 --> 00:22:47.023
The baby? Please.
I was returning him to his herd.

157
00:22:47.148 --> 00:22:49.192
Oh, yeah. Nice try, bucktooth.

158
00:22:49.317 --> 00:22:51.361
- Callin' me a liar?
- I didn't say that.

159
00:22:51.444 --> 00:22:53.529
You were thinkin' it.

160
00:22:53.654 --> 00:22:56.282
I don't like this cat. He reads minds.

161
00:22:56.866 --> 00:23:00.453
- Name's Diego, friend.
- Manfred, and I'm not your friend.

162
00:23:00.703 --> 00:23:07.794
Fine, Manfred. If you're lookin' for the
humans, you're wastin' your time. They left.

163
00:23:07.877 --> 00:23:11.047
Thanks for the advice. Now beat it.

164
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:15.176
I'll help you bring it to its herd,
but leave me alone after that.

165
00:23:15.301 --> 00:23:18.846
- OK. OK, deal. What's your problem?
- You are my problem.

166
00:23:18.971 --> 00:23:23.267
I think you're stressed, so you eat too much.
It's hard to get fat on a vegan diet.

167
00:23:23.393 --> 00:23:27.480
I'm not fat. It's all this fur.
It makes me look poofy.

168
00:23:27.563 --> 00:23:31.484
All right, you have fat hair.
But when you're ready to talk, I'm here.

169
00:23:34.654 --> 00:23:37.990
What are you doin'? Just drop it on the ledge.

170
00:23:38.116 --> 00:23:41.244
- We should make sure they found him.
- Good idea.

171
00:23:41.369 --> 00:23:43.830
No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

172
00:23:43.955 --> 00:23:46.040
Don't spear me.

173
00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:52.213
- This is a problem.
- Now what?

174
00:23:53.297 --> 00:23:55.842
That's perfect.

175
00:24:25.997 --> 00:24:28.499
- I told you they were gone.
- Look who it is.

176
00:24:28.624 --> 00:24:31.294
Don't you have some
poor animal to disembowel?

177
00:24:31.419 --> 00:24:35.214
They couldn't be far. I mean,
they went this way, or this way?

178
00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.675
You don't know much
about tracking, do you?

179
00:24:37.842 --> 00:24:41.637
I'm a sloth. I see a tree,
eat a leaf. That's my tracking.

180
00:24:41.763 --> 00:24:43.973
You didn't miss them by much.

181
00:24:44.098 --> 00:24:47.477
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

182
00:24:47.894 --> 00:24:52.023
It's still green.
They headed north two hours ago.

183
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.070
You don't need this aggravation.

184
00:24:58.029 --> 00:25:01.824
Give me the baby. I can
track humans down a lot faster than you.

185
00:25:01.949 --> 00:25:04.619
And you're just a good citizen helpin' out?

186
00:25:04.744 --> 00:25:08.247
- I just know where the humans are going.
- Glacier Pass.

187
00:25:08.373 --> 00:25:11.918
Everybody knows they have
a settlement on the other side.

188
00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:17.840
Unless you know how to track, you'll never
reach them before snow closes the pass.

189
00:25:18.007 --> 00:25:21.010
Which should be, like, tomorrow.

190
00:25:21.135 --> 00:25:26.933
So, you can give that baby to me,
or go get lost in a blizzard. It's your choice.

191
00:25:33.648 --> 00:25:37.902
Here's your little bundle ofjoy.
We're returning it to the humans.

192
00:25:38.027 --> 00:25:43.533
The big, bad tigey-wigey gets left behind.
Poor tigey-wigey.

193
00:25:43.658 --> 00:25:46.452
Sid, tigey-wigey is gonna lead the way.

194
00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:52.709
Manny, can I talk to you for a second?

195
00:25:52.792 --> 00:25:57.588
No. The sooner we find the humans,
the sooner I get rid of Mr Stinky Drool-Face,

196
00:25:57.714 --> 00:26:00.174
and the baby, too.

197
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.970
You won't always have
Jumbo around to protect you.

198
00:26:04.053 --> 00:26:09.642
And when that day comes, I suggest you
watch your back, cos I'll be chewin' on it.

199
00:26:09.767 --> 00:26:13.521
�ber-tracker. Up front, where I can see you.

200
00:26:13.646 --> 00:26:15.189
Help me.

201
00:26:30.955 --> 00:26:34.625
You gotta make it stop.
I can't take it any more.

202
00:26:34.834 --> 00:26:38.921
- I've eaten things that complained less.
- He won't stop squirming.

203
00:26:39.047 --> 00:26:41.132
- Watch its head.
- Put it down.

204
00:26:41.257 --> 00:26:43.801
Jeez, "pick him up, put him down... "

205
00:26:44.135 --> 00:26:47.347
- Its nose is dry.
- That means something's wrong with it.

206
00:26:47.472 --> 00:26:50.433
- Someone should lick it. Just in case.
- I'll do it.

207
00:26:50.558 --> 00:26:52.977
- He's wearing one of those baby thingies.
- So?

208
00:26:53.102 --> 00:26:55.855
So if he poops, where does it go?

209
00:26:58.274 --> 00:27:02.236
- Humans are disgusting.
- OK, you. Check for poop.

210
00:27:02.362 --> 00:27:05.573
- Why am I the poop-checker?
- Returning him was your idea,

211
00:27:05.698 --> 00:27:09.118
you're small and insignificant,
and I'll pummel you if you don't.

212
00:27:09.243 --> 00:27:11.704
- Why else?
- Now, Sid.

213
00:27:18.378 --> 00:27:21.506
I mean, my goodness.
Look out. Coming through.

214
00:27:21.631 --> 00:27:24.467
- Watch out.
- Stop wavin' that thing around.

215
00:27:24.592 --> 00:27:27.303
I'm gonna slip.

216
00:27:30.765 --> 00:27:33.017
It's clean. Got ya!

217
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:37.313
Will you cut it out?

218
00:27:39.190 --> 00:27:42.026
Do that again. He likes it.

219
00:27:44.153 --> 00:27:47.281
It's makin' me feel better too.

220
00:27:47.407 --> 00:27:49.534
Here, you hold it.

221
00:27:56.124 --> 00:27:57.834
Turn him towards me.

222
00:27:58.126 --> 00:28:00.336
Where is the baby?

223
00:28:01.379 --> 00:28:03.589
There he is.

224
00:28:03.715 --> 00:28:06.509
Where is the baby?

225
00:28:07.051 --> 00:28:10.221
There he is.

226
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:12.849
Stop it. You're scarin' him.

227
00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.439
- I bet he's hungry.
- How about some milk?

228
00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:22.567
- I'd love some.
- Not you. The baby.

229
00:28:22.692 --> 00:28:25.278
I ain't exactly lactating right now, pal.

230
00:28:25.403 --> 00:28:28.114
- You're a little low on the food chain to...
- Enough.

231
00:28:28.239 --> 00:28:31.743
Enough, enough, enough.

232
00:28:34.287 --> 00:28:36.330
Food.

233
00:28:44.547 --> 00:28:46.215
I don't know, but I've been told

234
00:28:46.341 --> 00:28:48.426
I don't know, but I've been told

235
00:28:48.551 --> 00:28:52.680
End of the world be mighty cold

236
00:28:53.139 --> 00:28:55.600
Prepare for the Ice age!

237
00:28:55.725 --> 00:28:58.186
Protect the dodo way of life!

238
00:28:58.311 --> 00:29:02.565
Survival separates the dodos from the beasts!

239
00:29:03.691 --> 00:29:06.277
Protect the dodo way of life!

240
00:29:06.402 --> 00:29:08.613
Prepare for the Ice age!

241
00:29:08.738 --> 00:29:11.699
- Ice age?
- I've heard of these crackpots.

242
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.163
- Intruders.
- Now, don't fall in.

243
00:29:17.288 --> 00:29:21.292
- If you do, you will definitely...
- Intruders. Intruder...

244
00:29:23.086 --> 00:29:24.962
<i>.. burn and die.</i>

245
00:29:26.130 --> 00:29:29.258
Can we have our melon back?
Junior's hungry and...

246
00:29:29.384 --> 00:29:32.637
No way. This is our private
stockpile for the Ice age.

247
00:29:32.845 --> 00:29:36.891
Subarctic temperatures will force us
underground for a billion years.

248
00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:39.060
So you got three melons?

249
00:29:40.603 --> 00:29:44.607
If you weren't smart enough
to plan ahead, then doom on you.

250
00:29:44.732 --> 00:29:48.403
Doom on you. Doom on you. Doom on you.

251
00:29:48.528 --> 00:29:51.280
- Get away from me.
- Doom on you.

252
00:29:51.406 --> 00:29:53.658
Oh, no. No.

253
00:29:54.075 --> 00:29:57.662
Retrieve the melon.
Tae kwon dodos, attack.

254
00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:12.927
- The melon.
- The melon, the melon, the melon...

255
00:30:14.721 --> 00:30:17.015
There goes our last female.

256
00:30:24.564 --> 00:30:28.067
- Got it, got it, got it.
- Don't got it.

257
00:30:29.068 --> 00:30:31.529
The last melon.

258
00:31:58.282 --> 00:32:01.327
Sid. Now we gotta find more food.

259
00:32:04.706 --> 00:32:08.668
Right, more to the right. Right, right, right.

260
00:32:08.793 --> 00:32:12.422
- Look at that. Dinner and a show.
- Left, left, left.

261
00:32:18.386 --> 00:32:22.390
Now to find a meal
befitting a conquering hero.

262
00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:28.312
What ho? A foe? Come on,
come on. You want a piece of me?

263
00:32:31.983 --> 00:32:34.027
Spoils worthy of such a noble...

264
00:32:43.202 --> 00:32:45.246
Bedtime, squirt.

265
00:32:54.964 --> 00:32:56.841
The triumphant return.

266
00:32:56.966 --> 00:32:59.802
Huh? Oh, that.

267
00:33:00.928 --> 00:33:05.266
I'm so full. How about a good-night
kiss for your big buddy, Sid?

268
00:33:06.059 --> 00:33:09.103
- He's asleep.
- I was talking to you.

269
00:33:10.021 --> 00:33:12.106
Fine, I'll tuck myself in.

270
00:33:18.488 --> 00:33:21.574
All right, good night.

271
00:33:44.138 --> 00:33:46.265
Will you stop it?

272
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:49.394
All right, all right. I was trying to relax.

273
00:33:55.108 --> 00:33:57.151
Oy.

274
00:34:45.366 --> 00:34:48.661
- What the...?
- Slice me. It'll be the last thing you ever do.

275
00:34:48.786 --> 00:34:52.373
- I'm workin' here, you waste of fur.
- Frustrated, Diego?

276
00:34:52.498 --> 00:34:55.501
Tracking down helpless infants
too difficult for you?

277
00:34:55.626 --> 00:34:59.672
- What are you two doin' here?
- Soto's getting tired of waiting.

278
00:34:59.797 --> 00:35:05.053
Yeah, he said "Come back with the baby,
or don't come back at all. "

279
00:35:06.637 --> 00:35:08.931
I have a message for Soto.

280
00:35:09.057 --> 00:35:11.517
Tell him I'm bringing the baby.

281
00:35:12.769 --> 00:35:14.979
And tell him I'm bringing...

282
00:35:15.605 --> 00:35:17.648
a mammoth.

283
00:35:17.774 --> 00:35:20.443
- A mammoth?
- Mammoths never travel alone.

284
00:35:21.069 --> 00:35:24.614
This one does,
and I'm leading him to Half Peak.

285
00:35:26.199 --> 00:35:28.409
Look at all that meat. Let's get him.

286
00:35:28.534 --> 00:35:32.747
Not yet. We'll need the whole pack
to bring this mammoth down.

287
00:35:32.872 --> 00:35:34.916
Get everyone ready.

288
00:35:35.625 --> 00:35:37.669
Now.

289
00:36:00.858 --> 00:36:03.986
- Where's the baby?
- You lost it?

290
00:36:05.613 --> 00:36:06.781
Sid.

291
00:36:07.699 --> 00:36:11.369
It's so ugly. Positively adorable.

292
00:36:11.494 --> 00:36:15.331
Hello, pumpkin. Hello, little baldy bean.

293
00:36:15.623 --> 00:36:19.460
- Where'd you find it?
- The poor kid, all alone in the wild.

294
00:36:19.627 --> 00:36:21.796
Sabres were closing in on him.

295
00:36:21.921 --> 00:36:24.882
- So I just snatched him.
- So brave.

296
00:36:25.008 --> 00:36:29.762
Yeah, well, he needed me,
and I only wish I had one of my own, too.

297
00:36:29.887 --> 00:36:34.017
Really? I find that attractive in a male.

298
00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:37.729
Alas. Who wouldn't want
a family, I always say.

299
00:36:38.354 --> 00:36:42.025
- Where've you been hiding?
- Yeah, well, you know...

300
00:36:45.528 --> 00:36:49.282
Cute kid, huh? So, as I was saying, ladies...

301
00:36:51.492 --> 00:36:54.037
Hey. Hi, Manny.

302
00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:56.998
What's the matter with you?

303
00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:01.669
Excuse me, ladies. You just keep
marinating and I'll be right back.

304
00:37:04.088 --> 00:37:06.174
Sexy.

305
00:37:06.799 --> 00:37:09.969
He's not much to look at,
but it's so hard to find a family guy.

306
00:37:10.053 --> 00:37:13.514
Tell me about it.
All the sensitive ones get eaten.

307
00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:17.685
No, no, no. Manny, please,
I'm begging you. I need him.

308
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:21.356
- A good-lookin' guy like you?
- You say that, but you don't mean it.

309
00:37:21.481 --> 00:37:25.943
No, seriously. Look at you.
Those ladies, they don't stand a chance.

310
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:29.530
- You have a cruel sense of humour.
- Don't let me cramp your style.

311
00:37:29.614 --> 00:37:32.658
- Thanks, Manny. You're a pal.
- Without Pinky.

312
00:37:32.742 --> 00:37:35.078
Manny, I need him.

313
00:37:38.706 --> 00:37:41.709
So, ladies, where were we?

314
00:37:42.043 --> 00:37:44.712
- Carl.
- Easy, Frank.

315
00:37:47.423 --> 00:37:51.719
Pretty tail walks by, suddenly he moves
like a cheetah. And that tiger...

316
00:37:51.844 --> 00:37:55.640
Yeah, Mr Great Tracker.
Can't even find a sloth.

317
00:37:55.765 --> 00:37:59.602
What am I? The wet nurse?
What are you lookin' at, bone bag?

318
00:38:01.896 --> 00:38:05.566
Look at you. You're gonna
grow into a great predator.

319
00:38:06.025 --> 00:38:10.363
I don't think so. What have you got?
You got a little patch of fur.

320
00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:12.990
No fangs, no claws.

321
00:38:13.116 --> 00:38:16.452
You're folds of skin wrapped in mush.

322
00:38:16.869 --> 00:38:19.539
What's so threatening about you?

323
00:38:24.794 --> 00:38:27.672
Does this look like
a petting zoo to you? Huh?

324
00:38:30.591 --> 00:38:34.178
OK. All right, wise guy.
You just earned a time-out.

325
00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.101
You think that's funny? How about this?

326
00:38:42.270 --> 00:38:45.023
You'll be a little snack for the owls.

327
00:38:46.774 --> 00:38:49.902
You're a brave little squirt, I'll give you that.

328
00:38:56.034 --> 00:39:00.621
Thank goodness. Thank goodness.
No. A tiger.

329
00:39:00.747 --> 00:39:03.249
Help. Help.

330
00:39:03.416 --> 00:39:05.543
- Where's the baby?
- Manfred has him.

331
00:39:05.668 --> 00:39:09.839
Just put me in your mouth.
Come on. Hurry up. He got me.

332
00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:11.841
Help.

333
00:39:11.966 --> 00:39:14.510
- Get away from me.
- It went this way.

334
00:39:15.345 --> 00:39:17.597
Over here.

335
00:39:25.313 --> 00:39:27.815
Carl. The tiger beat us to him.

336
00:39:29.275 --> 00:39:31.861
Wait a minute.

337
00:39:36.824 --> 00:39:39.327
He's dead all right.

338
00:39:39.452 --> 00:39:41.537
Carnivores have all the fun.

339
00:39:44.123 --> 00:39:48.836
Gosh, I hate breaking their hearts
like that. But you know how it is.

340
00:39:49.671 --> 00:39:52.340
All right, thanks. You can put me down now.

341
00:39:52.965 --> 00:39:55.093
Manny. Manny.

342
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:59.389
Guys, I thought we were in a hurry.
And Diego, spit that out.

343
00:39:59.514 --> 00:40:02.558
You don't know where it's been.

344
00:40:02.642 --> 00:40:06.396
Boy. For a second there,
I thought you were gonna eat me.

345
00:40:06.521 --> 00:40:09.607
- I don't eatjunk food.
- Thought you were gonna...

346
00:40:09.691 --> 00:40:12.110
I thought you were gonna... Were you?

347
00:40:14.904 --> 00:40:19.867
Come on, wait up. Wait up. Come on,
come on. Can you wait a second, please?

348
00:40:19.992 --> 00:40:22.036
Fellas.

349
00:40:23.329 --> 00:40:25.373
Thanks for waiting.

350
00:40:25.498 --> 00:40:28.167
Three, two, one...

351
00:40:31.129 --> 00:40:33.172
Sure is faithful.

352
00:40:48.062 --> 00:40:50.189
- Don't make me reach back.
- He started it.

353
00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:53.526
I don't care who started it. I'll finish it.

354
00:41:26.309 --> 00:41:29.187
Modern architecture. It'll never last.

355
00:41:43.701 --> 00:41:45.703
Hiya, Manny.

356
00:41:47.663 --> 00:41:49.874
Hi, Diego.

357
00:41:56.798 --> 00:41:58.841
Hey, Sid.

358
00:41:59.258 --> 00:42:02.970
- You're lost.
- No. I know exactly where we are.

359
00:42:03.054 --> 00:42:05.390
Ask him directions.

360
00:42:05.515 --> 00:42:08.184
- I don't need directions.
- Fine, I'll ask him.

361
00:42:08.267 --> 00:42:11.354
Buddy. You see any humans go by here?

362
00:42:14.524 --> 00:42:17.485
I love this game. I love this game. OK, OK.

363
00:42:17.610 --> 00:42:22.031
Three words. First word.
Stomp. No, no. Stamp, stamp.

364
00:42:22.115 --> 00:42:24.283
Let me try. Pack.

365
00:42:24.450 --> 00:42:28.621
Good one, Manny.
Pack of long teeth and claws.

366
00:42:30.164 --> 00:42:32.208
Pack of wolves? Pack of...

367
00:42:32.333 --> 00:42:35.003
Pack of bears? Pack of fleas?

368
00:42:35.128 --> 00:42:37.171
Pack of whiskers? Pack of noses?

369
00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:39.841
- Pachyderm?
- Pack of lies.

370
00:42:39.966 --> 00:42:42.885
Pack of troubles. Pack a wallop.
Pack of birds.

371
00:42:43.177 --> 00:42:45.221
Pack of flying fish.

372
00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:36.898
Great news. I found a short cut.

373
00:43:39.859 --> 00:43:43.863
- What do you mean, short cut?
- I mean faster than the long way around.

374
00:43:44.197 --> 00:43:46.115
I know what a short cut is.

375
00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:51.496
Either we beat the humans to Glacier Pass
or we take the long way and miss 'em.

376
00:43:51.746 --> 00:43:55.333
Through there? What do you take me for?

377
00:43:55.416 --> 00:43:58.878
This time tomorrow,
you could be a free mammoth.

378
00:43:59.337 --> 00:44:02.006
Or a nanny. I never get tired of peekaboo.

379
00:44:02.090 --> 00:44:04.967
Guys. Guys. Check this out.

380
00:44:07.345 --> 00:44:09.847
Sid, the tiger found a short cut.

381
00:44:12.016 --> 00:44:14.060
No, thanks. I choose life.

382
00:44:14.185 --> 00:44:16.771
Then I suggest you take the short cut.

383
00:44:16.938 --> 00:44:20.733
- Are you threatening me?
- Move, sloth!

384
00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:28.199
Way to go, tiger.

385
00:44:28.282 --> 00:44:30.785
Quick. Get inside.

386
00:44:53.516 --> 00:44:56.144
OK, I vote short cut.

387
00:45:10.742 --> 00:45:14.412
Guys, stick together.
It's easy to get lost in here.

388
00:45:30.053 --> 00:45:32.096
Guys?

389
00:45:49.447 --> 00:45:51.449
A fish.

390
00:46:33.825 --> 00:46:37.912
Will you keep up, please?
Hard enough to keep track of one baby.

391
00:47:23.207 --> 00:47:25.251
I gotcha.

392
00:47:41.934 --> 00:47:44.395
Captain, iceberg ahead.

393
00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:52.904
Oh, no.

394
00:48:44.247 --> 00:48:46.499
Yeah. Who's up for round two?

395
00:48:51.004 --> 00:48:53.047
Tell the kid to be more careful.

396
00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.216
Look, look. Tigers.

397
00:49:39.302 --> 00:49:44.015
No, it's OK, it's OK. Look, the tigers
are just playing tag with the antelope.

398
00:49:46.100 --> 00:49:50.563
- With their teeth.
- Come on, Sid, let's play tag.

399
00:49:50.688 --> 00:49:52.732
You're it.

400
00:49:53.941 --> 00:49:57.111
Sure. OK, OK, OK, where are the sloths?

401
00:49:57.236 --> 00:50:00.073
You never see any sloths.
Have you ever noticed?

402
00:50:00.198 --> 00:50:03.743
- Look, Manny, a mammoth.
- Somebody pinch me.

403
00:50:03.868 --> 00:50:07.038
Hey, hey, this fat one looks just like you.

404
00:50:07.955 --> 00:50:10.249
And he's got a family.

405
00:50:10.375 --> 00:50:13.711
And he's happy.
Look, he's playing with his kid.

406
00:50:13.836 --> 00:50:17.507
See? That's your problem.
That's what mammoths are supposed to do.

407
00:50:17.632 --> 00:50:20.343
- Sid...
- Find a she-mmoth, have baby mammoths...

408
00:50:20.468 --> 00:50:21.886
- Sid.
- What?

409
00:50:22.011 --> 00:50:24.055
- Shut up.
- But...

410
00:53:51.846 --> 00:53:54.098
Would you look at that.

411
00:53:54.223 --> 00:53:57.226
The tiger actually did it. There's Half Peak.

412
00:53:57.352 --> 00:54:00.021
Next stop, Glacier Pass.

413
00:54:00.438 --> 00:54:04.192
- How could I ever have doubted you?
- Did you hear that, little fella?

414
00:54:04.317 --> 00:54:06.361
You're almost home.

415
00:54:11.115 --> 00:54:13.618
- My feet are sweating.
- Do we need a newsflash

416
00:54:13.743 --> 00:54:17.080
- every time your body does something?
- Ignore him.

417
00:54:17.205 --> 00:54:20.375
Seriously. My feet are really hot.

418
00:54:26.130 --> 00:54:28.424
Tell me that was your stomach.

419
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:30.718
I'm sure it was just thunder.

420
00:54:31.052 --> 00:54:33.930
From underground?

421
00:54:54.242 --> 00:54:56.369
Come on, keep up with me.

422
00:54:56.494 --> 00:54:59.247
I would if you were moving.

423
00:55:01.666 --> 00:55:04.794
- I wish I could jump like that.
- Wish granted.

424
00:55:09.215 --> 00:55:13.553
- Come on, move faster.
- Have you noticed the river of lava?

425
00:55:32.822 --> 00:55:34.866
Hold Pinky.

426
00:56:06.356 --> 00:56:08.483
Manny.

427
00:56:19.952 --> 00:56:24.624
Manny, Manny, Manny, you OK?
Come on, come on, say something. Anything.

428
00:56:27.043 --> 00:56:29.087
What? What? I can't hear you.

429
00:56:29.295 --> 00:56:31.506
You're standing on my trunk.

430
00:56:33.549 --> 00:56:36.969
- You're OK. You're OK.
- Why did you do that?

431
00:56:37.095 --> 00:56:39.806
You could have died, trying to save me.

432
00:56:40.264 --> 00:56:42.809
That's what you do in a herd.

433
00:56:42.934 --> 00:56:45.061
You look out for each other.

434
00:56:45.269 --> 00:56:47.522
Well, thanks.

435
00:56:49.732 --> 00:56:54.278
I don't know about you guys,
but we are the weirdest herd I've ever seen.

436
00:57:12.672 --> 00:57:15.675
I can't wait to get
my claws in that mammoth.

437
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:19.554
No one touches the mammoth
until I get that baby.

438
00:57:22.974 --> 00:57:25.643
First, I'll slice its hind quarters into sections.

439
00:57:25.727 --> 00:57:29.897
- I'll put the white meat in one pile and...
- Knock it off. I'm starving.

440
00:57:30.023 --> 00:57:33.693
Next, the shoulders. Occasionally
tough, but extremely juicy.

441
00:57:33.818 --> 00:57:36.988
- I told you to knock it off.
- Save your energy.

442
00:57:37.113 --> 00:57:40.074
Mammoths don't go down easy.

443
00:57:40.366 --> 00:57:42.660
There's only one way to do it.

444
00:57:42.827 --> 00:57:45.329
First, you have to force it into a corner.

445
00:57:46.205 --> 00:57:50.001
Cut off its retreat.
And when you three have it trapped,

446
00:57:50.293 --> 00:57:52.378
I'll go for the throat.

447
00:58:02.388 --> 00:58:05.141
Guys, we gotta get this kid outta the wind.

448
00:58:09.437 --> 00:58:11.689
- How much further?
- Three miles.

449
00:58:11.814 --> 00:58:15.151
I'm beat. We'll get there in the morning.

450
00:58:18.321 --> 00:58:21.949
- What are you doin'?
- I'm putting sloths on the map.

451
00:58:24.869 --> 00:58:27.997
Why don't you make it realistic
and draw him lying down?

452
00:58:28.122 --> 00:58:30.166
And make him rounder.

453
00:58:32.752 --> 00:58:36.506
- Perfect.
- I forgot how to laugh.

454
00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:45.973
I'm a genius.

455
00:58:49.686 --> 00:58:54.607
From now on you'll have to
refer to me as Sid, Lord of the Flame.

456
00:58:54.857 --> 00:58:58.236
Lord of the Flame, your tail's on fire.

457
00:59:06.285 --> 00:59:10.248
Thank you. From now on,
I'm gonna call you Diego.

458
00:59:10.373 --> 00:59:12.667
Lord of Touch Me and You're Dead.

459
00:59:12.792 --> 00:59:15.878
I'm just kiddin', you little knucklehead.

460
00:59:16.462 --> 00:59:18.631
Lovebirds.

461
00:59:18.756 --> 00:59:20.800
Look at this.

462
00:59:24.762 --> 00:59:26.806
I don't believe it.

463
00:59:40.278 --> 00:59:45.241
Come here, you little biped.
Come here, you little wormy-worm.

464
00:59:45.366 --> 00:59:47.535
Come to Uncle Sid.

465
00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:50.663
No, no, no, no, no, no. This way. This way.

466
00:59:51.789 --> 00:59:54.459
No, no, no. No, go to him.

467
00:59:55.626 --> 00:59:57.670
Go to him.

468
01:00:00.089 --> 01:00:01.341
OK.

469
01:00:02.759 --> 01:00:06.471
Good job. Keep practisin'.

470
01:00:09.432 --> 01:00:12.560
Look at that. Our little guy is growing up.

471
01:00:14.896 --> 01:00:17.899
All right, come on. Sleep time, lumpy.

472
01:00:23.571 --> 01:00:25.615
Look at that big pushover.

473
01:00:27.241 --> 01:00:31.537
You know, Diego, I've never had
a friend who would risk his life for me.

474
01:00:31.996 --> 01:00:36.292
Yeah, Manny's... he's a good guy.

475
01:00:36.751 --> 01:00:38.795
Yeah, he is.

476
01:00:39.545 --> 01:00:41.923
Well, good night.

477
01:01:14.038 --> 01:01:19.585
Let's get you all cleaned up. What's your
daddy gonna say if you go back all stinky?

478
01:01:20.461 --> 01:01:24.507
Let me just clean that up.
That looks good. A little bit here.

479
01:01:24.632 --> 01:01:28.428
- You clean up nice, little fella.
- I think he's starting to look like me.

480
01:01:28.553 --> 01:01:30.596
Diego, what do you think?

481
01:01:32.348 --> 01:01:34.684
- Maybe we shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

482
01:01:34.809 --> 01:01:38.563
If we save him, he'll be a hunter.
And who do you think he'll hunt?

483
01:01:38.813 --> 01:01:41.190
Maybe because we save him,
he won't hunt us.

484
01:01:41.315 --> 01:01:45.862
Yeah, and maybe he'll grow fur and
a long skinny neck and call you Mama.

485
01:01:46.446 --> 01:01:51.784
- What's your problem?
- Nothing. Let's go. I'm freezing my tail off.

486
01:02:11.137 --> 01:02:13.264
Diego. You frozen back there?

487
01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:19.520
- Get down.
- What?

488
01:02:19.645 --> 01:02:21.898
- Get down and follow me.
- What's goin' on?

489
01:02:22.023 --> 01:02:27.028
At the bottom of Half Peak,
there's an ambush waiting for you.

490
01:02:27.153 --> 01:02:29.405
- What?
- What do you mean, "ambush"?

491
01:02:31.657 --> 01:02:33.785
- You set us up.
- It was my job.

492
01:02:33.910 --> 01:02:37.455
- I was to get the baby, but then...
- You brought us home for dinner.

493
01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:40.333
- That's it. You're out of the herd.
- I'm sorry.

494
01:02:40.458 --> 01:02:42.502
No, you're not. Not yet.

495
01:02:42.752 --> 01:02:46.381
- Listen, I can help you.
- Stay close, Sid. We can fight our way out.

496
01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:49.717
You can't. The pack's too strong.
You have to trust me.

497
01:02:49.842 --> 01:02:53.096
Trust you? Why in the world
would we trust you?

498
01:02:53.221 --> 01:02:55.264
Because I'm your only chance.

499
01:03:08.945 --> 01:03:10.947
Hello, ladies.

500
01:03:11.864 --> 01:03:17.286
- Look who decided to show up.
- Diego, I was beginning to worry about you.

501
01:03:17.412 --> 01:03:23.626
No need to worry. In about two minutes
you'll be satisfying your taste for revenge.

502
01:03:23.793 --> 01:03:25.461
Very nice.

503
01:03:25.878 --> 01:03:28.923
I see the sloth. And he's got the baby.

504
01:03:29.048 --> 01:03:34.387
Don't give away your positions until you
see the mammoth. He's the one to surprise.

505
01:03:35.638 --> 01:03:38.099
You want to maul something, don't you?

506
01:03:38.224 --> 01:03:41.686
- I wanna maul.
- Then what are you waiting for?

507
01:03:44.605 --> 01:03:47.358
No, I said wait for the mammoth.

508
01:04:09.422 --> 01:04:12.550
Backscratcher. Eat my powder!

509
01:04:28.191 --> 01:04:30.234
Loop-de-loop.

510
01:04:31.277 --> 01:04:33.404
Slalom! Slalom, baby!

511
01:04:59.138 --> 01:05:02.934
Sorry, fellas. He got a little frostbite.

512
01:05:04.602 --> 01:05:06.646
Get him.

513
01:05:09.691 --> 01:05:11.734
Surprise!

514
01:05:16.698 --> 01:05:21.327
OK, follow me. We'll pick up Sid
and get outta here while we can.

515
01:05:21.452 --> 01:05:25.373
Come on, Diego,
let's bring this mammoth down.

516
01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:40.054
There he is.

517
01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:44.559
That's right. Where's the baby?

518
01:05:48.479 --> 01:05:51.733
Survival of the fittest.

519
01:05:51.858 --> 01:05:54.652
I don't think so. Yeah.

520
01:06:05.913 --> 01:06:10.376
- What are you doing?
- Leave the mammoth alone.

521
01:06:13.338 --> 01:06:16.341
Fine. I'll take you down first.

522
01:07:32.333 --> 01:07:34.377
We did it.

523
01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.809
We were some team, huh?

524
01:07:50.560 --> 01:07:53.938
Were? Come on, we're still a team.

525
01:07:54.439 --> 01:07:56.983
I'm sorry I set you up.

526
01:07:57.525 --> 01:08:00.319
You know me -
I'm too lazy to hold a grudge.

527
01:08:03.698 --> 01:08:05.742
Knock it off, squirt.

528
01:08:06.743 --> 01:08:08.745
You gotta be strong.

529
01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.415
You have to take care of Manfred and Sid.

530
01:08:13.458 --> 01:08:15.460
Especially Sid.

531
01:08:15.585 --> 01:08:19.422
Come on, you can lick this. You're a tiger.

532
01:08:19.547 --> 01:08:22.633
Look, I'll carry you.
Come on, what do you say?

533
01:08:22.759 --> 01:08:25.011
Come on, Diego, come on.

534
01:08:25.136 --> 01:08:27.263
Tell him he's going to be OK, Manny.

535
01:08:28.848 --> 01:08:32.477
Listen, you have to leave me here.

536
01:08:32.602 --> 01:08:36.773
If those humans get through the pass,
you'll never catch them.

537
01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:40.485
You didn't have to do that.

538
01:08:40.610 --> 01:08:43.321
That's what you do in a herd.

539
01:11:59.142 --> 01:12:01.185
Don't forget about us.

540
01:12:01.310 --> 01:12:03.354
OK?

541
01:12:05.606 --> 01:12:08.317
We won't forget about you.

542
01:12:47.982 --> 01:12:50.568
Goodbye.

543
01:12:50.651 --> 01:12:53.112
Goodbye. Goodbye.

544
01:12:53.237 --> 01:12:55.531
- Sid...
- Bye.

545
01:12:56.991 --> 01:12:59.035
Bye.

546
01:13:01.829 --> 01:13:04.207
That's right. Where's the baby?

547
01:13:04.374 --> 01:13:06.876
Come on, Sid, let's head south.

548
01:13:24.894 --> 01:13:26.854
Bye.

549
01:13:28.022 --> 01:13:31.484
Save your breath, Sid.
You know humans can't talk.

550
01:13:32.026 --> 01:13:34.070
Diego? You're OK.

551
01:13:34.237 --> 01:13:37.407
- Nine lives, baby.
- You're OK.

552
01:13:37.532 --> 01:13:39.575
You're OK.

553
01:13:40.284 --> 01:13:42.328
I could kiss ya.

554
01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.249
Welcome back, partner. Wanna lift?

555
01:13:46.374 --> 01:13:49.335
No thanks. I gotta save
whatever dignity I've got left.

556
01:13:49.544 --> 01:13:53.965
You're hanging out with us. Dignity's
got nothing to do with it. I'll take that lift.

557
01:13:54.090 --> 01:13:56.592
- Yeah, climb aboard.
- Pick me up, buddy.

558
01:13:57.176 --> 01:14:00.638
Mush. Or not mush. Either way.

559
01:14:04.434 --> 01:14:07.020
This is gonna be the best migration ever.

560
01:14:07.145 --> 01:14:12.025
I'll show you my favourite watering holes.
I turn brown when the fungus in my fur dries.

561
01:14:12.150 --> 01:14:15.903
- Attractive.
- This whole Ice age thing is getting old.

562
01:14:16.029 --> 01:14:19.323
You know what I could go for?
Global warming.

563
01:14:19.449 --> 01:14:22.493
- Keep dreamin'.
- No, really...

565
01:22:02.412 --> 01:22:04.455
