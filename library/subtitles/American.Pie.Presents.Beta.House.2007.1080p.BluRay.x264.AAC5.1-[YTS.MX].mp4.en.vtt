WEBVTT

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.845
Man, will you look at all the hot tail
running around this place?

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.314
Man, will you look at all the hot tail
running around this place?

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.351
Look, look. Oh, God.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.950
Dad, listen, could you just... Please,
please don't embarrass me today, okay?

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.513
- Embarrass you?
- Not today.

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.517
Son, you spent the entire summer depressed

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.200
because your girlfriend ran off
with that pretty boy, Trent.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.073
Now, you gotta get out there
and crush some ass!

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.519
It's the only way to get your mind off her.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.200
- Yes. Yes, that is what I'm talking about.
- Yes, huh?

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.311
"Crush some ass"? Oh, come on.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.393
Wait, wait, wait.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.954
- I'll show you how it's done.
- Oh, no. No, no, no.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.798
Watch this. Just watch and learn.
- Just please drive.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.832
Excuse me, ladies? Hi. Hi.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.155
- This is my son, Erik.
- Hi.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.993
And he's moving in today,

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.238
and we were just wondering
if maybe either of you were interested

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.952
in showing him a good time?

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.839
No, thanks.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.038
Oh!

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.309
I'm sorry.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.398
- He's a stallion, just like his old man!
- No, Dad, come on!

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.470
Well, I tried, Erik.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.238
Yeah, thanks.
Now I'm gonna have to transfer.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.635
- Son, son?
- Yeah.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.954
I want to show you something.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.436
That is the list of all the chicks
I ever banged.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.035
Are you serious?

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.435
- Is that two-sided? It is! Nice!
- It is!

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.757
Yeah. It's a good goal foryou to try
to keep up with your old man.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.028
Hey, Dad, why isn't Mom's name
the last name on the list there?

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.070
Uh...

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.352
We didn't tell you, but when you were three,
we had a trial separation for a week.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.674
Trial...

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.073
Dad, there's like... Well,
there's 10 names here for that week alone.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.794
Yeah, I went on kind of
a poon-tang bender, there.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.955
Is that my mom's name?

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:24.640
Yeah, you know, on second thought,
I'll just kind of hang on to that.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.320
Come on, guys. Let's get loaded here!

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.791
- I'm sorry.
- Cooze, grab a box.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.273
- Did you have sex with his mom?
- Yeah.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.435
How was it?

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.955
Wow! This place is amazing.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.915
Hi.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.873
God, there are girls everywhere.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.634
This is my room.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.830
It still kind of sucks
that we're not gonna be rooming together.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.030
Dude, whatever.
You're gonna be right down the hall.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.832
Besides, I got a single.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.678
- Hold on to this. I'm gonna find a bathroom.
- All right.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.438
I'll be right back.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.357
Hi, how you doing?
Mike Coozeman. Glad to meet you.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.756
Wow. This is gonna
take some getting used to.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.754
Yeah, isn't this the guy's bathroom?

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.713
No, it's coed. All the dorms are like this.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.278
Cool, coed, yeah.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.277
Don't worry. I won't peek.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.358
Yeah, I won't peek... I won't peek, either.

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.199
I'm Ashley, what's your name?
- I'm Erik.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.591
Well, it's nice to meet you, Erik.
- It's nice to meet you, too.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.833
Hey, do you think you could pass me
my shampoo? It's just right there.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.915
- Yeah. Just give me a minute here, okay?
- Thanks.

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.159
Erik?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.115
Erik?

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.152
Alittle help here?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.758
Ride the white whale, baby!

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.029
Ride the white whale.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.230
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God. Oh, man. I'm sorry.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.270
I'm sorry, the doorwas...

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.753
- Hey, you must be Erik.
- I am.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:25.949
- I'm Bobby.
- Hi.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.354
Hey.
- Hey, hey.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.232
- Come on in, man.
-  No, no, no. It's...

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.158
- You guys are busy. I can come back later.
- Okay, listen. This is your place, too,

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.589
and don't worry about Margie.
She's not exactly shy.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.119
No, she's not.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.550
- Sit down. You want a beer?.
- No.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.477
- You sure?
- Yeah.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.433
Are you hungry?
Margie cooked up some mean bratwurst.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.320
- No, I just had a sandwich. Thanks.
All right.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.351
- Where're you from?
- East Great Falls.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:51.959
East Great Falls.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.756
Slow down, sassy pants.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.155
All right, baby?
I'm trying to have a conversation.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.349
Yeah.

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.317
- College! Yeah! Best years of our lives!
- Yeah.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.839
Put it up.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.876
Oh, high...
High-five.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.429
You wanna jump in on this?

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.755
- Come on. Margie loves it.
- No, no, no. Margie, no, no.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.632
Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no, I'm good.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:19.638
Look, it was very nice to meet you,
Bobby and Margie.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.637
Actually, I just came
to change my pants here.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.594
I spilled a drink on it earlier,
so I'm just gonna let you guys... Yeah.

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.153
Are you role-playing again?

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.068
Say the safe word, baby. Say the safe...
Baby? Are you choking?

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.952
- Dude, I think she's choking!
- What?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.354
I think she's choking.
You gotta do something.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.390
- Do something.
I can't do anything!

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.112
I'm tied up and basted
like a Thanksgiving turkey.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.357
All right, all right, all right. I got it.
Hold on. From the spot.

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.595
Oh, my Jesus.

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.994
What do you want me to do with all this...

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:45.348
Get out!

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.038
- Erik? No!
Sorry.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.593
All right, son!

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.109
Yeah! That's what being a Stifler's all about.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.078
- No, no, no. She was choking.
That's it!

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.474
- I was helping her.
- That's how Stiflers do college.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.194
Now, let's just give these kids some privacy.

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.151
Doing good. Keep it up.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.475
I'm not trying to freak you out, roomie,
but I just totally came.

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:42.914
Is this where
Laura Johnson and Sara Coleman live?

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.956
Yeah, I'm Laura Johnson
and this is my roommate, Sara.

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.669
My name is Dwight Stifler.

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.392
I'm here with the
Freshman Welcoming Committee,

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.670
and I've been given instructions
to escort you ladies

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.836
on a guided tour of the entire campus.

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.315
- That's so sweet.
- Yeah.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.556
Should we wear anything special?

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:05.916
Dude, there is no way that everybody
in this is a student here.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.031
Look, he's holding her boob.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.275
He is.

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:12.995
No, man, they are.
I've had a subscription for, like, a year.

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.633
That'll be good.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.558
That's not a cologne ad.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:20.990
I've used that exact issue
more times than I can count.

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.959
You smell pretty.

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.314
- Sorry.
- That was so uncalled for.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.159
- Wow.
- Is this Erik Stifler's room?

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:39.229
Yeah.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.316
Welcome to college, boys.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.872
Yeah. No, I wouldn't lie to you.
I'm dead serious.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.753
Most sororities won't even give you a bid
unless you've had a threesome.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.836
It shows that you work well
within the group dynamic,

00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:57.393
and that you're really prepared
for sisterhood.

00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.430
You know what I'm saying?

00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.993
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:01.235
Oh, man. Who is this guy?

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.828
Dude, he's the reason we came
to college here.

00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:11.388
- You like that?
- That was awesome.

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.432
You have to give a little bit back
every now and then.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:17.279
- Hey, hey, shower buddy!
- Oh, hey. Hi.

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.469
Shower buddy?

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.433
Yeah, Erik and I met
when I was showering this afternoon.

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.437
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.313
Oh, right, the coed bathrooms. Yeah.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.271
It took me about three years
to get the board of trustees

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.550
to approve that one. Worth it.

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.238
Oh, Ashley, hi. This...

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.794
Everyone, this is Ashley.
Ashley, this is everyone.

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:34.909
Hi, everybody.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:37.759
This is my roommate, Denise.
She just came here from Georgia.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.393
Hey, y'all.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:42.717
Well, I do declare, a real life Scarlett O'Hara.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.829
Oh, my.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.393
Well, hey, you guys aren't taking off,
are you?

00:08:45.520 --> 00:08:48.637
Yeah, we're going to this cocktail mixer
at the Epsilon Sigma Kappa House.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.672
Oh, no, no, no. The Geek House?
No, trust me.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.268
- I wanna stay but...
But we promised, so...

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.756
Plus, Ashley thinks this party
is a little bit d�class�.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:58.949
What? Like sleazy?

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:01.799
Hey, baby. How you doing, sweetheart?
Grab a beer.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.433
No, you got the wrong idea
about this whole thing.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.199
Look, this is just a little meet and greet
that I set up to, sort of,

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.799
you know, demonstrate our school spirit

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:10.309
and our, you know,
dedication to this university.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.351
Beta House fucking rules!

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.039
Real classy.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.072
- Erik, it was really nice to see you again.
- Yeah.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.997
- Guys, till next time.
- Yeah, see you.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:28.348
Bye, guys.
Bye.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.198
- It's nice to meet you.
- See you.

00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.118
Hey, Stifler,
what's up with this Geek House?

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.434
Yeah, I never even heard of it.

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.236
I know a Geek house sounds harmless,
but they are a nightmare.

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.473
They were a social club for decades,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.875
till a group of rich geeks came in
and threw some money around,

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.991
built the house, got a new charter.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.678
Wait, a geek fraternity?

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:49.791
To get in,
you need, like, perfect SAT scores.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.911
Transfer $2 million to my Swiss account.

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.430
Then they check your family tree
and calculate future earnings potential.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.075
No, I said buy at 60, not sell at 60.
You're fucking fired!

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.365
They got billionaire alumni.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:00.832
They got billionaire alumni.

00:10:00.960 --> 00:10:02.109
Hey, it's only 100 grand.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:06.838
They run the student government,
and the faculty loves them.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.796
But don't even get me started
on the women.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.149
They attract the most beautiful women
from the entire school.

00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:17.752
Who wants to hang out
with a house full of geeks?

00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.751
It's a new world out there.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.757
These women realise
that the geeks are gonna be the millionaires

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.995
right out of school.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.429
They've just adjusted their nesting habits.

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.398
Hey, don't sweat it.
Beta's still where the party's at, right?

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.753
Look out!
Stifler, the judging's about to begin.

00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:41.270
Judging?

00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.118
Oh, the Beta House never disappoints.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.550
- Are you serious? It's always like this?
- All the time.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.393
- These girls are ridiculous.
- Ridiculous. Get the clipboard.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.190
Sweetie, you are naughty.
I am keeping you after class.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:15.317
Bring that ruler. I've also been bad.

00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.391
And this one over here's got great abs.

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.398
They look like fresh buttered rolls
right out of the oven.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.988
This is the best idea I've ever had!

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.638
- No, I just... I can't handle it.
- This is chicken scratch. You're a caveman.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.633
She's pulling them out.
She's pulling them out.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.312
Perfect 10!

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.396
- Beta! Beta!
Beta! Beta!

00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:00.392
Ladies and gentlemen,
depravity is haunting this university.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.232
Sex, alcohol, vulgarity, stupidity.

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.635
Once, this was a respected institution
of higher learning.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.718
We are declaring a new age
at this university.

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.068
An age in which a student's worth

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.794
is no longer measured
by his blood alcohol level,

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:19.593
but rather, his GPA.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:24.430
We formed this fraternity to change the way
geeks are thought of in this country.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.510
But as history has proven,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.438
for a new civilization to emerge,

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:34.154
another must crumble.

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:39.474
We must destroy the Betas.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.273
Hey, Stacey, my hands are wet.
I can't get this beer open.

00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:50.594
Will you do it for me?

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.118
Thanks. Those Kegel muscle exercises
are really paying off, huh?

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:02.595
So what do we have to do to become Betas?

00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.270
Well, obviously, you guys are cool with me.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.630
What you need to do
is impress the rush chair, Wesley.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:08.795
- Have you guys met Wesley?
Uh-uh.

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:10.239
You haven't? All right.
He's in the other room.

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.873
Come on, I'll introduce you. Follow me.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.639
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:22.832
His nickname is the Blackout Menace.

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.870
He's a perfect student,

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.956
except for his habit
of getting belligerently drunk,

00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.152
blacking out,
causing complete and total mayhem,

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.998
and never remembering a thing.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.155
Uh...

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.953
Excuse me. Where is this plane going to?

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.748
Detroit.

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:49.433
Thank God.

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:55.030
All right, excuse me.
Where is it coming from?

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.388
Bangkok.

00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.834
- Whose kid is that?
- Yours. You adopted him yesterday.

00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:05.439
Congratulations.

00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.075
Hey, buddy.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:12.839
Are you serious?

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.669
Yep, just dropped Sung Lee off
at their embassy this last week.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.873
Kid nearly caused an international incident.

00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.388
Wesley!

00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:25.874
Sorry to interrupt.
Wesley, this is my cousin and his buddies.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.669
- Hi.
Hey.

00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.119
- Erik, right?
-  Yeah.

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:32.198
Mike Coozeman.
How come we didn't see you last year?

00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:35.437
I was in a Mexican jail.
I had to tunnel my way out.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.473
But I made it back in time for finals
which is what we're all about here at Beta,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.953
education.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.715
Right.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.398
- You wanna dance?
- Yeah.

00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:47.119
Let's get sexy.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.878
Hey, you ready?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.390
There's a hundred hot horny chicks
here tonight. I'm counting on you.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.876
Get some, baby! Get some!

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.116
Call me irresponsible

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.391
Call me unreliable

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.356
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:44.790
Are you gonna start drinking?
Because I desperately need a wing man.

00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.356
No, I'm not drinking tonight, Bull.
I had a rough night last week.

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:51.358
Oh, really? Really? That's fine.

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.550
Because then I just might have
to tell these fine, young ladies

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.229
about a certain frat boy
and a Mexican transvestite!

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.349
All right, all right, all right.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.159
One drink.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.798
Yeah, just one.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.509
Hey.

00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.029
What the hell's with you, man?

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.357
Can you not see all this prime ass
a foot from your face?

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:32.596
Yeah, man, I see. It's... It's pretty cool.

00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.518
Yeah, it's cool. You should be tearing it up!

00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:36.516
You guys, it's just...

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.790
Remember last year?
We came up here, I had the time of my life.

00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.117
You know, I did stuff I neverwould
have dreamed I would've ever done,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.639
and I kind of figured it would change me.

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.513
Yeah, okay.
So you got drunk and you ran naked, right?

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.790
But you blew it
with a really hot sorority chick

00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:50.911
to run home and have sex
with your little girlfriend.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.031
Yeah, Erik. That stunt might
have won you points in high school,

00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:55.037
- but this isn't high school.
- No.

00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:56.354
I guess you guys are right.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.233
Listen, college is your one chance
to start over. Okay?

00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.636
You get to hit the reset button on life.
You get to be anybody you wanna be.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:06.548
- Never thought of it like that before.
- Yeah. Here, slug that.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.758
- That a boy. Julie, this is my cousin, Erik.
-  Hey.

00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.633
I just wanted you to know Erik voted
for you in the hottie contest,

00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:17.876
and since he's, like,
the ladies' man of the family,

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.877
I totally trust his taste.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.438
- You want to dance, gorgeous?
- I'd love to.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.793
Anybody you wanna be. Yeah.

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.799
Wow, you can really put that away.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.150
You kidding me?
This stuff is like waterto me.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.157
Hey, hey, everybody,
settle down for a second!

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.430
We're just having
a little, minor technical glitch.

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.949
No big deal.
We'll get everything fixed up in a minute.

00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.680
I don't think so, Stifler!

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:03.031
You see,
you overloaded your prehistoric circuits.

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:05.913
I'm afraid your music won't be coming on
forthe rest of the night.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:09.112
Don't... Don't listen to him.
We'll get everything fixed in a minute.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.834
That won't matter
because by Jake's calculations,

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.076
based on the amount
of kegs and liquor you bought,

00:18:14.200 --> 00:18:17.272
you should be running out, just about now.

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.960
- Bullshit.
- The fucking kegs are dry!

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:23.516
We're out of fucking booze!

00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:26.708
I know!

00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.035
Settle down! It's fine. We'll make a beer run.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.559
They could do that,

00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.878
oryou can all come to the Geek House
where we have enough liquor to last a week,

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.639
along with all the champagne you can drink.

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.109
We also have a heated pool
and enough swimsuits for everyone.

00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:45.390
That is, if you even want to wear one.

00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.555
Yeah!

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:52.151
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.952
Oh, it's your choice, people.

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.799
- Stay here and get puked on...
- Okay, I'm out of here.

00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:59.115
Or come party, VIP style.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.595
All right! Let's go! Let's go!

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.959
Fucking Edgar.

00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:17.396
Prick really knows how
to throw that money around, huh?

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.078
Oh, yeah.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.078
Oh, but it doesn't help that numbnuts here
barfed all overthe chicks, either.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.553
Yeah.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.592
- Sorry about that.
- You look disgusting.

00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:32.309
- Erik, for crying out loud, man!
- I'll clean it up.

00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:41.559
Not again.

00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:47.359
Morning, sexy.

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.477
Some party, huh?

00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.830
Hey, baby. How you doing?

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.399
No. No, no, no.

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:03.311
How you feeling there, cuz?

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.990
A lot better. Thanks.

00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:08.588
No need for thanks, we're family.

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.392
Right now, I gotta run.
I gotta go down to the basement,

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:12.795
take care of some official Beta business.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.195
- Have some of Peaches' eggs.
- Okay.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:17.117
All right. Thanks, Peaches.

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.670
Oh, buddy.

00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:25.478
- I need this place.
That a boy!

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.110
Yeah.
- Off the hook! Work it!

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:29.958
So, guys, the hard-on champ is in?

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.035
- Yeah!
All right.

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.513
Aye, aye.

00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:38.116
Yeah, I love this guy.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:39.958
Beta? I love Beta!

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.917
You like Beta, baby?
Best rack in the house, though.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.758
I fucking love Beta, baby!

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.031
Shut up! Shut up! Everyone calm down.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.434
I told you I didn't want to drink.

00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.074
Look how the pig squeals!
Look how the pig squeals!

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.792
All in favour of Bobby Coolidge?

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.035
- Everyone.
- Aye, aye.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:56.354
- Aye, aye.
- Aye, aye.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:21:00.511
All right, all right.

00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:03.277
Oh, man!
Jesus!

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:05.434
Holy crap! Wow!

00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.949
Man, this guy really knows
how to work a room.

00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.310
Give him a bid.
He'll be a pussy magnet, buddy.

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:11.919
Yeah!

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:16.512
Oh, no!

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:20.349
Hey, hey, hey!
All right, that's my cousin. Take it easy.

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:24.951
No offence, brother, okay? But I don't know
if your cousin is up for the challenge, man.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.072
I'm with Bull on this one.
I mean, he's a nice kid,

00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:30.873
but he passed up sleeping
with Brandy, man.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.558
All right, all right, all right.

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.353
Look, I know Erik missed his big chance
to, like, sleep with the one girl

00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:38.233
that, I'm assuming, everybody in this room
would lop off your left nut to bang.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.873
- Am I right?
Two nuts.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.433
All right, does that mean
he's not Beta material?

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.039
- Yes!
Yeah!

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.392
He was young and dumb
and in love. He's a... He's a late bloomer.

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.272
I think he's gonna surprise you
this semester.

00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:51.760
And anyway, he's a legacy,
so he's automatically getting a bid.

00:21:51.795 --> 00:21:53.591
So you can all fuck off.

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.071
- Aye.
- Aye, aye!

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.270
Yeah, that's what I thought, bitches.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.551
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:10.592
- We have to stop meeting like this.
- Yeah.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:16.670
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I just had a really rough night.

00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.108
You know, I think Denise has
a crush on yourfriend, Cooze.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.878
She thinks he's sweet.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.719
- Denise thinks Cooze is sweet?
- Yeah.

00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.639
- Wait, actually...
- Erik, I...

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.832
- I was thinking...
- Look, I'm just thinking...

00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.872
- Do you wanna go out with me once?
- Yeah.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:43.197
- Really?
- Yeah. That would be really nice.

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:46.517
Okay, keep...
You have really pretty teeth, by the way.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.878
What's going on?

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.634
This sucks.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.878
Hey, guys. Don't go that way.
This way's quicker.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:11.873
- Dude, I left the best sandwich in my dorm.
This sucks.

00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:19.710
- Wait a second. Where are we?
- I don't see any sandwiches here.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.638
Hey, guys. You wanna see something?

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.637
Yes.
- That is...

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.039
Gentlemen,

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.712
today is the first day
of the rest of your lives.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:53.755
You are the select few who have
been chosen to pledge the Beta House.

00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.393
Beta, baby!

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.520
Now, most fraternities do the pledging thing
a little bit differently than we do.

00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:07.758
Most pledging consists
of hate-filled mental and physical hazing

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.279
designed to break you down.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.072
But here at Beta,

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:16.354
I, Dwight Stifler, your pledge master,
have devised an elaborate scientific plan

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:19.392
to build teamwork and brotherhood.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:23.919
Gentlemen, I give you your pledge board.

00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:29.476
On this pledge board are 50 tasks

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.558
that you and your pledge brothers
must complete by semester's end

00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.318
if you want to become Betas.

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:36.431
To start things off,

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:40.269
I say we begin with my personal favourite,
number 37.

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.955
Okay, so here's the low-down.

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:56.837
One of you has got to get your ass signed
by a stripperwith photo proof. All right?

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.079
All right, we're gonna go get a drink.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.110
- Wesley...
- Yeah.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.231
Don't bother us.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.915
Okay, who's gonna try and do this?

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:12.199
Oh, you guys, I got this. Who's got a pen?
That'll do.

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:19.190
Hey, baby, how's about signing my ass
while I'm up here?

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.471
She got Cooze! We gotta help him!

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.231
Down goes fatty!

00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:35.997
Stripper brawl!

00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:40.436
Stifler, we need some help!

00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.479
Oh, cousin got clothes-lined.
That's a shame.

00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:49.550
That's gonna leave a big bruise.

00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:56.190
Those girls are wild tonight.

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.039
I used to fuck girls like you in prison.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.596
- Oh, I love a good stripper brawl.
- Who doesn't?

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:09.794
-  You started it!
- Way to go, Cooze.

00:26:09.829 --> 00:26:11.789
-  You started it!
- Way to go, Cooze.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.399
What? I didn't do anything.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:16.432
You charged that stripper with a pen
like you were going to shove it in her ass.

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.312
Maybe if her panties
smelled like waffles,

00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.589
then you would have done something...

00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:20.869
Shut up. Shut up!

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.638
...some syrup. That idiot?
- I bet she would have liked that.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.553
- Hey there, gorgeous. You work here?
- Yeah, sweetie.

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:30.790
You see,
we're pledging the Beta House right now,

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:34.230
and one of our tasks
is to get our ass signed by a...

00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.874
A professional dancer like yourself.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.549
So I was just, you know, wondering
if maybe you'd do me the honour?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:44.150
That's a different approach
than the boys usually take in this place.

00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.316
- Bend over.
- Thanks.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.998
My name's Erik Stifler, by the way.

00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:50.395
Let me get one for the year book.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.875
Nice smile.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.072
- You have any relation to Dwight Stifler?
- He's my cousin.

00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:00.873
- Hey, Stifler.
- Candy. How are you, sweetheart?

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.479
Good to see you.

00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.034
I can see where he gets his charm from.

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.232
- You come see me soon, okay?
- You know I will.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.033
All right, boys.
Hey, congratulations. Task 37.

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.116
- In the bag! Done!
Yeah.

00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:16.477
Good job, boys.
That's our first task completed.

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.673
I think that stripper's implant broke my face.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.669
Everyone, let's go.

00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:25.351
Sweet Caesar's ghost!

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.394
Fifteen, check.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.476
Sixteen, check.

00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:49.873
Hmm.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:59.274
- Who's that guy?
- He's my Swahili instructor.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.277
I have my proficiency exam next week.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.799
- Nice!
- Yeah.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:06.353
Hey, what's...
What's this golden hammer doing in here?

00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:08.914
It's from the Greek Olympiad.

00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.350
It was, like, a series of competitions
involving skill and deviant behaviour.

00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:15.358
They got really out of hand,
so the university banned them for life.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.471
The Betas were legendary at them, though.
We never lost.

00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.431
- Cool. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.995
Oh, and remember, Erik...

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.115
Yeah.

00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:36.150
Swahili.

00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:40.314
This place is swell, isn't it?
Yeah.

00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.714
Look at how juicy.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.392
Sucking the crab? Wow.

00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:47.114
- This place is fun.
- Yeah. Yeah, this place is awesome.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:49.196
I thought you'd like it here, you know.

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:52.198
I like this mallet.

00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:58.149
- Oh, my God. Are you okay? Here.
-  It's all right.

00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.553
It doesn't really taste that bad.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:04.518
Dude, I'm telling you,
this chick can't get enough of me.

00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.358
I did her again last night!

00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:09.313
Oh, I can't believe that. You're the man!

00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.839
I think I know that girl.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.951
You know,
not all frat guys are like those guys.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.355
I know. I guess I just have a jaded opinion.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.311
Really? Why's that?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:19.192
It's just the typical story.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:22.039
Boy meets girl.
Boy goes off to college, joins a frat,

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.798
starts sleeping with every girl he can.

00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.992
Girl finds out
and dumps his ass during winter break.

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:29.830
But that was high school.
I'm much older and wiser now.

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:34.112
Right, older and wiser. And you're on a date
with a guy who's pledging a frat.

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:36.595
I know, and I'm watching you.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.275
- Dine and ditch.
- Yeah.

00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.674
That's, like, one of my favourite plays of...

00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.949
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:45.439
Little help here!

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.311
You are just the sweetest.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.115
You just bring it out in me, babe.

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.796
- Perfect.
- Yeah?

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.195
- Careful, my feet are real sensitive.
- Really?

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:19.754
Oh, my.

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.555
I love foot massages.

00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:28.395
Oh, my!

00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.473
I can't!

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.279
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's cool.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.996
It's totally fine, really.

00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:01.236
Here, let me just take care of you.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:03.714
Okay.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.234
Ooh!

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.756
- You like that?
- God, yeah.

00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.430
You do that almost as good as I do.

00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:28.472
How're you feeling?

00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.598
Hey. Good, thanks.

00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:32.869
- Here, let me see.
- Oh, no.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.638
No, no. Ashley, it's...
You really don't need to do anything.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:37.069
Oh, my God, Erik.
You have to put something on that.

00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.997
No, it's just a little red.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.039
Here, let me.

00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:44.028
Are you sure?
Yeah.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.390
It's not...

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:50.634
- Does it hurt?
- No, it's just really cold.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.069
Does that feel better?
- Yeah.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.118
Mmm-hmm.

00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.275
Wow!

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.198
- Oh, man!
- I didn't even touch it.

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.189
No, it's no big deal.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.231
I guess I should just
take it as a compliment, right?

00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:08.920
- I'm sorry. Yeah. I'm sorry.
- It's cool.

00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:12.671
Wow, that cream feels good.

00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:15.312
Ash, you might wanna...

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.589
Just relax.

00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.354
It's still hot.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.115
Oh, my God! Mr Biggles!

00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.709
- This is really, really embarrassing.
- No, it's okay. It's okay.

00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.957
I just haven't seen anything like that.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.799
Well, I was a virgin until last year,

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:11.198
and then my girlfriend dumped me
about four months ago.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.268
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.
Are you telling me that you haven't...

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.992
In four months?

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:24.399
Well, you see, there was this incident
that made masturbation

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.438
very taboo in my household.

00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.311
Well, you have more self-control
than most people.

00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:35.591
I'm really sorry about Mr Biggles.

00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.635
Yeah.

00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.311
- Just a little... Right.
- No, it's...

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:50.235
Oh, baby, I love you. Whoa, baby,
why won't you tell me you love me, too?

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:54.239
- Hey, Bull. Have you seen Stifler?
- He's in a meeting.

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.511
- What meeting would he be at?
- I don't know. Something important.

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:00.155
And it was after my parents...

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:04.432
Well, they had to fire
the fourth landscaping crew

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.476
because they caught me with them.

00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.991
And that's when I knew that I had a problem.

00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:18.191
But I have been sex-free for two years now

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.118
and, you know, never felt better.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:29.631
You are so brave.

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:35.993
Get it in there! Yeah! Faster! Faster!

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.590
- I'm going as fast as I can.
- Faster, bad boy!

00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.511
Faster, I said!

00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:47.352
- I think I'm gonna...
- It's gonna break!

00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.033
Yes! Yes!

00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.589
God, yes.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.118
Oh, boy.

00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:08.273
You call yourself a man?

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:11.551
Get back here and fuck me!

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:17.115
Okay, okay. All right, listen.
I just did three times, okay?

00:36:17.240 --> 00:36:21.836
I'm gonna go get an icepack
and then I'll be right back.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.875
You know the secret,
icepacks are for pussies!

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:31.432
Oh, your friend. He wants to come play!

00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:33.596
I'm going to see you again!

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.952
- I'm a grizzly bear!
- You're bad.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:42.356
I'm gonna steal a picnic basket
full of orgasms.

00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:45.391
Okay, lay your head back.
Lay your head back.

00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:48.318
Ready? Are you ready for it?
Let's go, all right?

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:53.275
Hands and feet inside the tram.
Next stop, penetration station, baby.

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:58.392
Hey, get back here!

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.152
Stifler, I forgot to tell you...

00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.599
Whoa.

00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.553
- Get your ass over here, punk.
- Okay.

00:37:15.720 --> 00:37:18.951
Oh, dude. On her teddy bear? Really?

00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:21.595
Dude, he hasn't busted a nut
in, like, four months.

00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.869
What do you think I should do?

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.718
- Man, you gotta beat the bishop.
- Yeah.

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:28.310
- You need to punch that clown. A lot.
- What are you talking about?

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.990
- You need to masturbate, dude. A lot.
Alot.

00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:35.192
So next time you won't blow your load
when you're rounding first base.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.355
Yeah.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.671
Just gotta clean the pipes.

00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:18.196
- Who is it?
- Hey, it's Ashley.

00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:20.311
We were gonna hang out, remember?.

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.714
Yeah! Yeah, I remember.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.150
I... I lost track of time, Ashley.
I'll be right there.

00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:30.874
- Are you okay in there?
- Yeah.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.470
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
Just give me one second, okay?

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:36.639
Erik, are you naked?

00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:39.320
Just putting on my t-shirt right now.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.319
There it is.

00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.670
Whew!

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.629
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.832
- Can I come in?
- No. No, the place is actually a mess.

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.916
- Bobby's disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:52.873
- But I know a cool place we can go.
- Come on.

00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:02.995
All right. Right hand, yellow.

00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:04.790
Ooh.

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.512
I love this game.

00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.669
Don't you fall or you're losing those boxers.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.711
Oh, really?

00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:17.030
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.879
Ow.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.399
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.238
I'm sorry.

00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.319
- What? Are you a virgin or something or...
- No.

00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:47.836
It's just when I... When I get too excited...

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.151
Oh, it's embarrassing.

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.389
Here.

00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:02.317
- Let me just take care of you again.
- Okay.

00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.992
Oh, wait, wait, wait. Cheers, cheers.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.315
Mmm.

00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:17.397
Let me get that for you.
A little spillage. No big deal.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.312
It's not gonna go off again, is it?

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.796
Absolutely not.
I've been practicing my self-control a lot.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.273
Alot? Okay.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.315
Come on.

00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:56.273
Oh, just how much have
you been working on your self-control?

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.032
I'm really sorry. It's not working.

00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.237
My stupid friends, they said that if I would...

00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:07.874
Erik, it's okay. It happens.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:09.989
Wine?

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.799
All right, boys. We got a live one here.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:23.354
Two clicks north, three clicks east.

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.591
All right, three clicks east.

00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:29.835
Let's blast our big giant ones.

00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.552
Fire in the hole!

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.355
Direct hit!

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.431
-  Yes!
- Oh, my God.

00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:44.315
I love the smell of boobies in the morning.

00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:46.590
Hey, so how's it going with Denise?

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:52.471
Well, okay, so we hooked up
and she gave me a couple of hand jobs.

00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:54.595
Hand jobs?

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:57.234
They're actually the best hand jobs
I've ever had in my life.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:59.555
- Oh, really?
- Shut up!

00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:04.079
The only problem is
I try to stick my hand down her pants,

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.236
she keeps... Pulls my hands away.

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:07.839
She says she's embarrassed.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:08.836
Uh-oh.

00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:12.919
- Maybe she has an abnormally large bush.
- Yeah, or maybe she's got a yeast infection.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:16.469
- Come on.
- Maybe she's got a dick.

00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:17.590
Huh?

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:19.756
What? Crying Game? Boys Don't Cry?

00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.189
- That's based on true stories, boys.
- No.

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.355
- Yeah.
- No, there's no way.

00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:25.038
Hey, man, maybe she's a hermaphrodite.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.674
Transvestite? Alittle Shanghai Surprise!

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:28.789
Well, come on. You said yourself,

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.593
she gives you the best hand jobs
you've ever had in your whole life. Right?

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:32.675
Yeah, so?

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.916
So, how do you think she got so good at it?

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.634
Probably from working her own gear.

00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:41.712
So you guys think that I might have been
hooking up with a dude this whole time?

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.308
Maybe. There's only one way to find out.

00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.749
You gotta get into those pants.

00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:50.637
Oh, wait. This is too perfect.
Load it up. Load it up, right now.

00:42:54.320 --> 00:42:55.435
- What the...
Sorry!

00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.358
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.551
I want you to go down on me, Cooze.

00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.035
Are you sure? Because I can wait.

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.276
No, I want you down there now.

00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:23.477
That's it, Cooze.

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.792
That's it, Cooze.

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:34.589
Suck my cock!

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.914
She's got a dick!

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.433
Are you okay?

00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:43.075
Oh, my God. I just had the worse nightmare.

00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:46.432
What was it about? Who's got a dick?

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.035
I do.

00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:58.908
Oh, my God.

00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:00.873
I can't take this anymore.

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.275
Hello?

00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:21.512
I thought you were gonna call me.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:23.393
Oh, hey.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.317
Yeah. I fell asleep.

00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.875
I'm sorry.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.638
Were you dreaming about me?

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:31.714
Maybe.

00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.276
Hey, can you hold on for one sec?

00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.439
Because this

00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:41.799
isn't a dream.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.798
Oh, God. That's not mine. That's Bobby's.

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:00.993
That's not mine.

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:19.155
Guys. What the hell are you doing?

00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:21.271
Number 33, baby.

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:24.278
We got a chance to do number 33,
but we gotta go now.

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.470
- Half-naked girl here.
- Sorry, Ashley.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:28.556
Dude, the manager just called.
He's got an opening.

00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:31.911
- We haven't even rehearsed for that bit yet.
- It's our only chance, man.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.149
Really?

00:45:35.840 --> 00:45:37.558
Ashley, it is Number 33.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:42.438
Maybe, we could just finish later
or something?

00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.475
It's cool.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:49.069
I'm coming with you.

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:52.791
- We rocked that place.
- Yeah!

00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.796
Awesome!

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.715
Number 46, sex in the stacks. Chalk it up.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.514
Number 26, receive a golden shower.

00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.949
Number 27, perform a Cleveland steamer.

00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:08.513
- Check.
Oh, man.

00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:10.551
Get a panda in the grotto.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:13.114
- Thirty, get a blumpkin.
Oh, you didn't.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.879
After corned beef. It was disgusting.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.956
- All right. Yeah. That was pretty good.
Yeah!

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:20.674
By the power granted to me
by the great country of Canada,

00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.394
I now pronounce you life partners.

00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.917
Would you like to seal it with a kiss?

00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:27.950
- No.
- Yes.

00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:30.116
Number 41. Make it official.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:34.035
Because I'm a gentleman.

00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:38.913
Wow. You boys are such an inspiration.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:42.871
I think it's time we do
a little mid-semester celebrating.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.195
- What do you think?
- Yes. Definitely.

00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:57.912
Stifler, I'm afraid I gotta see everyone's IDs.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:00.870
Come on, Manny. You're joking, right?

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:02.479
I'm afraid not.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.909
You see, the new ownership
of this establishment

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.598
doesn't condone underage drinking.

00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:09.996
Officers, please escort these minors
from the premises.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:12.279
Can I touch your gun?
All right, okay. We're going.

00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:15.233
Bye-bye.
- You're fucking with traditions, Edgar.

00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.148
I'm not just fucking with your traditions,
I'm tearing them down.

00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:22.113
Take him away.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:27.069
You know, you are way too classy,

00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.034
and have way too nice of a body to be
hanging out with a douche bag like that.

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.756
Don't listen to him, honey.
Your body isn't that great.

00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:36.199
I'll have a gimlet, please. Thank you.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:39.395
Stifler.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:41.078
What?
- Your lawyer's here.

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:43.359
Excellent. Thanks, Marty. Send him in.

00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:45.638
You have a lawyer?.

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.111
Thanks for coming. I'm glad you got here.

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.073
Well, you know me.
I'm always down forthe cause.

00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.955
- Betas for life, baby.
- Betas for life.

00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:57.593
Mr Levenstein?

00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.233
Hey, Erik. How's your mom and dad?

00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.157
They're good. They're really good, actually.

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:03.714
- Well, that's good.
Hey, guys, this is Noah.

00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:06.274
He's a Beta alum.
He's our House-counselling consigliere.

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:09.597
This guy has gotten us out of more shit
than you can even imagine.

00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.439
Well you Beta boys do keep me busy,
that's for sure.

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.676
Now, I've just talked to the district attorney.

00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.951
He's an old school chum of mine.
He's willing to drop all the charges

00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.868
if you promise never to set foot
in the Silver Dollar again.

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.678
This is ridiculous.

00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.232
Where am I gonna have Sunday brunch?

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.157
Oh, look, I know you're upset.

00:48:29.280 --> 00:48:31.077
They do have a great omelet bar,
that's for sure.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:34.510
- But you're just gonna have to give it up.
- No, we can't.

00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:39.033
These geeks... These geeks are messing
with the Beta way of life.

00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:42.116
You want to step inside, Noah?

00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.878
- Oh, it's open?
Yeah.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.672
Oh, thanks Marty.

00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.831
If you wanna grab a sandwich,
I'll just be a minute.

00:48:51.080 --> 00:48:52.479
Look, fellas,

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.470
there is a bigger picture here
than the Beta way of life.

00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.750
Is that what you thought
when you were in the Beta House?

00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:02.389
No.

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:06.109
- No. It wasn't.
- So...

00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.390
So I think something has to be done here.
Within the confines of the law, of course.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.112
Of course. Of course.

00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:16.839
So what would you do?

00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:19.198
What would I do?

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:26.396
I would crush those geeks
with every Beta muscle in my body.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.718
But that's just me.

00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:33.994
See you boys at homecoming.
Say hi to your folks, Erik.

00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.838
I will. Thank you.

00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:46.834
Come on.

00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:05.115
Freeze, human.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:22.875
Uphold the galactic alliance with my cock.

00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:30.592
What the hell is going on in there?

00:50:30.720 --> 00:50:33.996
Sounds like a dog with its dick
stuck in a vacuum.

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.714
- All right, this way.
- I'm a husky ninja.

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:43.795
Okay.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.955
Guys, I really gotta take a dump.

00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.798
Oh, come on. Not now.

00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:55.036
That fast food I ate put me over.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.958
Oh! I can't wait.

00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:02.399
Well, hurry up, then.
God, that guy's disgusting.

00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:06.876
Okay. All right.

00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.909
Okay.

00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:21.830
All right.

00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:26.873
Come on.

00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:30.795
Ooh!

00:51:30.920 --> 00:51:34.151
- Bobby, what are you doing, man?
- Upper-decker, baby!

00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:35.838
Upper-decker, baby.

00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:38.358
Oh, my God.

00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:42.393
Betas, we are leaving. Go, go, go!

00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:49.279
What's happening?

00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.198
Well, pledges,

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:02.990
you completed every task
on the task board in record time.

00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:09.755
I, along with every other Beta in this room,
are proud to call you our brothers.

00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.389
Congratulations, you're all Betas!

00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.349
Oh, yeah.

00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:18.673
Hey, cuz.

00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:22.390
Yeah.
Here you go, cuz.

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.390
So it sounds like you got yourself
a pretty good girl there, buddy.

00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:35.670
Oh, yeah. You know what?
Now that pledge is finally over,

00:52:35.800 --> 00:52:37.552
we can spend a lot more time together, too.

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.110
What? Are you kidding me?

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.710
Edgar, get you and the Mensa rejects
out of my house, now.

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:53.712
You have crossed me
for the last time, Stifler!

00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:59.553
We're gonna settle this once and for all!

00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.999
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.595
Oh! What the fuck?

00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:16.514
We, the members of the Geek House,
challenge you, the Beta House,

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.358
to the Greek Olympiad.

00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.674
The Greek Olympiad?

00:53:19.800 --> 00:53:21.870
As much as I'd love to kick
your Geek ass up and down the field, Ed,

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:25.231
I hate to tell you, the Greek Olympiad's
been banned for like 40 years. So...

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:31.476
What's the matter?.
Afraid to get into a little trouble, Stifler?.

00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.074
Afraid?

00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.755
- Let's do this.
- Oh, but there is one catch.

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:38.836
We are playing for charters.

00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:43.439
If we win, you give up your charter
and you move out of the Beta House.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:45.758
And if you win,

00:53:46.560 --> 00:53:48.949
we move out and you take our house.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.312
This place against your mansion?

00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:54.512
Consider it another tradition
I plan to tear down.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:53:57.434
You're on.

00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:03.199
Are you out of your mind?

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:06.596
The Greek Olympiad
has been banned for life.

00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.472
You'll all get thrown off campus.

00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:13.469
- That's a chance we're gonna have to take.
- Oh, but the Greek Olympiad is crazy.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:18.276
I mean, yes, it's a combination of skill,
endurance, athleticism granted,

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.436
but there is a degree of perversion
in these games

00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:23.757
which I don't think
would serve you kids well.

00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:25.757
Do you happen to remember the name
of the last captain

00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.393
to ever win the Greek Olympiad?

00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:29.511
Well, I haven't the foggiest
because it was so long ago.

00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:32.279
His name was Noah Levenstein.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.399
Uh-huh.

00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:37.715
Well, I knew that would
catch up to me one day.

00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:40.638
But, you know, fellas,
I didn't know what was going on back then.

00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:42.034
I was just a dumb kid.

00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.991
Mr Levenstein, we need you.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:47.590
Tradition states
that the last team captain to win

00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:49.358
comes back to officiate.

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.118
I know it's tradition.

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.232
I... I suppose I could do it.

00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.476
I'd have to call in
and take a few personal days.

00:54:57.600 --> 00:55:00.068
Excellent. You will not regret this.
I promise you.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.794
- Stifler! This just came for you, man.
What is it?

00:55:07.560 --> 00:55:09.198
This is interesting.

00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.195
Hello!

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:16.628
I'm here. What's this big bombshell?

00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:25.998
Are you sure you weren't followed?

00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.680
You? What the hell are you doing here?

00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.470
- Well, well, Stifler.
- Rock.

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.919
Looks like we meet again.

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:40.511
- All right, this is a set-up. I'm out of here.
- Just relax, ass clown.

00:55:40.640 --> 00:55:43.438
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:46.313
What we had was a rivalry,

00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.193
but what Edgar did
got us kicked off campus.

00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:52.238
Wait, how do you even know the guy?

00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:56.832
He tried to pledge
our house three years ago.

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.236
He was the first regular sized guy
to rush the little person frat.

00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:04.191
They used to have this tradition
where we put a sheep in the basement...

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:05.196
Be gentle.

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:06.673
They'd tell us we had to bang the sheep

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.190
and that we couldn't come out
until the rubber was used.

00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.992
Now, one of two things happened.

00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:15.032
Either they would come out crying,

00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:19.954
orthey would beat off in the rubber
and say they did the sheep.

00:56:21.280 --> 00:56:24.670
And then there was Edgar.

00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:27.754
Good luck.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.877
We gotta check it out.

00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:45.990
For the love of God, man!

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:50.510
That sick bastard fucked the sheep.

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:54.198
That's a great story
but I'm a little unclear on how it helps me?

00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.715
I'm sure you'll figure something out, Shitler.

00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:18.194
Welcome to the Greek Olympiad!

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.992
Competing today in this ancient tradition

00:57:29.120 --> 00:57:30.917
are the Beta House...

00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.678
- Beta! Beta!
Beta! Beta!

00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:36.518
And the Geek House.

00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:43.877
Now, when we think of the term
Greek Olympiad,

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:47.675
we hearken back to ancient traditions.

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:52.429
We conjure up images of mighty warriors

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:56.395
in their little skirts, getting all oiled up,

00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.238
writhing around with each other.

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:04.309
Some called it wrestling,
others called it something else.

00:58:04.880 --> 00:58:09.556
But enough history. On with the games.

00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:20.191
The first event is called
The Release of Venus.

00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:25.271
The man who undoes all the brassieres
on his side the quickest, wins.

00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:27.279
You know, Ed,

00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:31.156
it's really a shame all that practice on your
sister's training bra is not gonna pay off.

00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.795
Please, Dwight. I spent a season
in Milan dating lingerie models.

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:36.831
It was before I met you.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.915
Gentlemen, are we ready?

00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.679
Decline and fall, Dwight. Decline and fall.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.072
Start unsnapping.

00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:05.473
You know, I still hold
the record in this event.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:06.669
Hands of a surgeon.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.711
-  Oh, what's up with Edgar?
- Chick's got double Ds.

00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.673
Squad clasps are really difficult to deal with.

00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:22.915
Done.

00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:23.995
Done!

00:59:25.240 --> 00:59:26.275
I knew it!

00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:27.799
Betas win.

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:32.793
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:35.553
Hey, nice try, Edgar.

00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:39.477
Oh, sorry, sweetheart.
I guess I was just in the zone.

00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.559
You know, with a little more to work with,
I might have won.

00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:46.555
The next event is The Battle of Ares.

00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:51.354
Two men fighting to the death,

00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:56.631
or until one knocks the other into the water.

00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.432
Yeah! Ride that!

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:03.191
You guys are so done, Edgar.
Bull is an animal with this thing.

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:05.754
Why don't you just save some face,
give me the deed to your place now.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.518
Not quite yet.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:10.479
You haven't met our new initiate, have you?

01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:20.478
His name is Dave Maul,

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:22.909
and he is the number-one rated
light saberfighter

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:24.951
on the science fiction convention tour.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:26.593
Oh, he's a virgin.

01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:28.153
Are you ready, boys?

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.268
Joust!

01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.274
Oh, shit!

01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.197
Take him! Take him!

01:00:58.640 --> 01:00:59.993
Finish him.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.035
Go! Come on!

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:11.796
- Geeks win!
- I need a beer.

01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.511
The next event is called Demeter's Feast.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:18.871
Now, in ancient Rome,
the pig was considered sacred.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:22.709
And often sacrificed
to the goddess of agriculture.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:26.272
Today, we've taken a pig, greased it up,

01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.358
and the first one who catches it, wins.

01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.318
Hey, you sure you're up for this pigging?

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.238
Stifler, I grew up on a farm with 652 pigs,

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.428
I can tell what the pig is thinking.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.953
Silly, little, fat man.

01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:54.799
Hey, Edgar, what's the deal with
Captain Sulu? He afraid to compete?

01:01:54.920 --> 01:01:56.956
You haven't heard of parkour, have you?

01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:03.990
What the...

01:02:05.160 --> 01:02:06.513
Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.910
Damn.

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.835
Come here, pork chop.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.749
Geeks!

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:17.639
Geeks win!

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:23.994
Shut up.

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:29.194
Greek Roulette is a very dangerous game.
Not for the faint of heart.

01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:33.638
One of these chambers contains a capsule

01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:37.309
with aged horse semen.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.273
Gentlemen, let us begin.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.239
Disgusting.
Oh, come on.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.918
Come on, come on!
Come on, Dwight!

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:10.034
You're busted. Come on.

01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:12.037
- It's gonna be...
We're not in it. Come on!

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.035
You know, I gotta hand it to you, Edgar.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:16.878
I really didn't think
you'd have the huevos for this.

01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:19.076
I thought you'd probably
recruit one of your lackeys.

01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.398
I wouldn't miss watching you shoot
yourself full of horse semen for anything.

01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:26.275
Come on, man.

01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.118
Come on, Stifler!

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.318
Yeah!
Yes!

01:04:35.160 --> 01:04:37.833
- We can do this! Yes, yes!
Come on!

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.348
That's how we do.

01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.708
Oh, boy!

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.270
- Come on! Come on!
Edgar!

01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:49.198
Come on, baby. Eat it!

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.674
Yeah!

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.314
- Put two canisters in there!
- Two? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Two?

01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:02.192
That's too many, Dwight.
Come on, two? He's not worth it.

01:05:02.320 --> 01:05:06.029
Unless Edgar's afraid, put in two canisters.

01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.752
Fine! Put in two!

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.919
Put in two.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.549
Go!

01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:17.835
Go!

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:21.031
Be a man, huh?
- Ready. Go!

01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:24.556
Warm it up.
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.277
All right, all right! All right!

01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.994
- All right!
- Everyone quiet!

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.190
We're good? Back to the match.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:34.469
You're good baby.
There's nothing in there.

01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.669
Oh, no. I can't watch this.

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:41.198
Yeah! Yeah!

01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:43.788
- Yeah! Yes!
Yeah!

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:47.151
- Yes! Yes!
All right! Yes! Yes!

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.759
You're up.

01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:50.989
Come on!

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:54.517
- Do it.
- Let's go.

01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.313
Do it!
Do it! Do it!

01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:59.829
- Do it!
Do it, now! Pull the fucking trigger.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:04.078
- Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!
Pull the trigger.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:08.915
Oh.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.838
Yes! We won! Sucker!

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:15.913
Betas win.

01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.998
- Enjoy Mister Ed's jizz.
- How does that semen taste, there?

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.349
Tough loss, there, Edgar,
but you know what they say, son.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.153
You've got to get right back
up on that horse.

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:28.235
So to speak.

01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:37.439
The ancient game of the Wife Carry
has been around for centuries.

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.391
The first couple
to complete the course wins.

01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.710
- You owe me big time for this.
- I know.

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:48.511
- Okay.
All right. Ready?

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:55.838
How pathetic. Now!

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.515
What? What...

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.312
Really? You trying to give Bandhu a hernia?

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.398
Oh, once again your pathetic little brain
has let you down, Dwight.

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:06.873
Bandhu, up.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.994
All right, Erik. We got this. Let's go.

01:07:14.520 --> 01:07:16.033
We're fucked.

01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:20.355
Come on, Erik! Go, go, go!

01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.072
We can beat those Betas.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.194
How'd you feel about that...

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.868
Come on! Come on!

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:47.995
Maybe I should have carried you.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.835
Man, that is one scary chick.

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.275
That's a chick?

01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:54.430
Okay.

01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.553
And now, the Peloponnesian War.

01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:02.914
The first team to consume
an entire keg wins.

01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:04.837
Throwing up does not disqualify.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.350
Gentlemen, inside this cylindrical
casing of aluminium,

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:11.517
lies 55 metric litres of malted alcohol.

01:08:12.120 --> 01:08:14.270
Remember, fellas,
don't underestimate these Geeks.

01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.356
Most of them are lonely problem drinkers,
all right?

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:19.233
Beware, gentlemen,
these men know how to drink,

01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.512
but we are more than men.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.392
We are more than men!

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.954
We, sirs, are Geeks!

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.196
Yes!
- All right, boys. Battle!

01:08:30.120 --> 01:08:33.237
- Gentlemen, chug-a-lug!
- I can out-drink you fucks!

01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:37.434
Drink!

01:08:43.600 --> 01:08:45.113
Edgar!

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.598
I only have one thing to say to you.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.676
What's that, you philistine?

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:01.234
Puking doesn't disqualify!

01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:05.118
- Geeks, attack!
-  Boot and rally, boys!

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:14.592
Come on, Edgar.
Let's see what you got, bitch.

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:19.593
That's all you got, huh? That's all you got?

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.956
Go back to the keg!

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:31.957
We got a man down!

01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:34.913
Gentlemen, we need to attain
maximum efficiency.

01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.635
Attach the device!

01:09:42.280 --> 01:09:44.350
- What the hell is that?
- What is that thing?

01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:45.913
Open valves.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:52.151
That's the Geeks taking the lead.
It's time for our secret weapon. Wesley!

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:55.355
Let's go!
- Wesley, keg stand!

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:05.079
Open the valves all the way.
We need warp speed on this, motherfucker!

01:10:07.560 --> 01:10:09.710
- Yeah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.193
Betas win!

01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:22.873
With the Greek Olympiad tied,
we now go into sudden death.

01:10:28.560 --> 01:10:32.599
The final event is called
The Rise of Aphrodite.

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:35.874
Quite simply, the first man

01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:42.275
who excretes his manly juices,

01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:46.279
in the ejaculatory sense,

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.669
loses.

01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.230
I cannot wait to see you come in your pants.

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.749
Let's do this.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.070
Pi is equal to 3. 1415...

01:11:14.200 --> 01:11:16.111
- No big deal at all.
-5978...

01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:18.595
I feel like Santa Claus
at the local shopping mall.

01:11:22.720 --> 01:11:24.392
- That was nothing. I'm okay.
- That was nothing for me, either.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.475
No big deal.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.312
Shake that thing.

01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.075
- I like your boobs.
Look at this.

01:11:43.200 --> 01:11:45.794
Pretend you're sucking my man breast!

01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:49.791
Give it up, Stifler.
This is a game of mind over matter.

01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:52.195
And my brain is way biggerthan yours.

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:53.719
I've got experience on my side.

01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:57.355
I'll take that over
yourVulcan mind tricks any day.

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.835
We shall see. Bring her in!

01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.076
We flew this young lady in from Las Vegas.

01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:05.953
She's the number one stripper
in the Emerald City.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:07.479
Enjoy, Dwight.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.675
Oh, no!

01:12:13.080 --> 01:12:14.399
Good luck.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:22.989
I'm in trouble here, boys.

01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:25.680
This chick is ridiculous. Bring her in!

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.030
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.479
What the fuck?

01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.355
Look at my tail, Edgar.

01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:46.311
Look how fluffy it is.

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.512
Somebody make her stop.

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:51.915
Edgar, you got a little wool fetish, buddy?

01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.271
No! Make her stop!

01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:03.434
He's done.

01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.594
Betas win.

01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:20.869
Beta! Beta! Beta! Beta! Beta! Beta!

01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:34.795
To the winners,
I now present the Golden Hammer!

01:13:35.360 --> 01:13:36.952
To Beta House!

01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:39.749
Beta, baby!

01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:43.395
Congratulations, Stifler.
You've kept the Beta traditions alive.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:46.592
- Thanks, Noah. Betas for life.
- Betas for life.

01:13:55.320 --> 01:13:57.151
Now this is a frat party.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.589
No. This is a Beta party.

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.436
- Hey, I got a little surprise for you.
- Yeah?

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:29.837
A little present for you being
so patient and understanding.

01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:31.475
Okay.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:35.396
- Are you ready for your present?
- I'm not sure.

01:14:36.240 --> 01:14:40.233
I'm really confused right now,
and I'm trying to keep an open mind but...

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.989
Oh, man this is fucked up even for me.

01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:45.678
DENISE: Here it comes.

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.718
Oh, my God. If it's biggerthan mine,
I swear, I'm gonna pass out.

01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:50.956
I'm not wearing any panties.

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.960
Easy, Cooze. Everybody can see you.

01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.958
Well, I'm sure we can find some place
around here with a little privacy.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.911
- Okay.
- Let's go.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:02.310
Come on.

01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.395
- Where are you taking me?
- It's a surprise. You're gonna like it.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.639
I'm nervous.

01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.431
What are you talking about?
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:26.278
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:36.709
Why don't I take care of you.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.559
Okay.

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:42.909
Okay.

01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:55.429
Oh, my.

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.830
I can't! I can't!

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:02.473
Look, just let yourself go, baby.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:05.512
There's nothing you can do
that's gonna surprise me. Okay?

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.232
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:09.155
Okay!

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:14.598
Why are you bringing me in here?

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:16.711
Well, this being our new house,

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.355
I thought I'd come up with my own task
forthe pledge board.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.909
Okay. What's that gonna be?

01:16:24.200 --> 01:16:26.555
Well, I think it's kind of better if I...

01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.193
If I show you.

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.555
Hmm.

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:36.671
Sex in a movie theatre.

01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:39.394
I like the way you think, Erik Stifler.

01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:57.308
I'm coming! I'm coming!

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.998
I'm coming!

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.069
Oh, my...

01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:08.075
Okay. I was a little surprised by that.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.474
I'm sorry.

01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.599
It's okay.

01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:17.351
- It was actually really sexy.
- Really?

01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:19.789
Yeah. Can you do that every time?

01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:23.149
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:24.554
Oh, my God.

01:17:34.840 --> 01:17:37.593
- Hey, buddy, take a little dip in the pool?
- Nope.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.392
Oh, wait a minute.

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:44.631
Yes. The elusive female ejaculation.

01:17:45.080 --> 01:17:47.036
Not a lot of girls can do that. Congrats.

01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:11.276
Beta House fucking rules!

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:10.074
Yes!

01:19:18.920 --> 01:19:20.399
Hey, big boy,

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.958
ready to fill me up with some more protein?

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:27.714
No, no, no. No!

01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:34.713
Yes, the Blackout Menace strikes again.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:35.155
Wear this foryour next dance, honey.

01:24:35.280 --> 01:24:36.395
Thanks.
