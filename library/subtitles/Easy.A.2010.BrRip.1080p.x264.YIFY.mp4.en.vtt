00:01:01.938 --> 00:01:06.317
<i>The rumours of my promiscuity
have been greatly exaggerated.</i>

00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:10.280
<i>I used to be anonymous,
invisible to the opposite sex.</i>

00:01:10.447 --> 00:01:12.240
<i>If Google Earth were a guy...</i>

00:01:12.407 --> 00:01:15.452
<i>...he couldn't find me if I was
dressed up as a 10-storey building.</i>

00:01:15.618 --> 00:01:19.330
<i>Pretty cutting-edge stuff, huh?
A high school girl feeling anonymous.</i>

00:01:19.497 --> 00:01:22.959
<i>Who am I? What does it all mean?
Why am I here? Blah.</i>

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:26.379
<i>But don't worry,
this isn't one of those tales.</i>

00:01:26.546 --> 00:01:28.506
<i>Though it sure started out that way.</i>

00:01:28.673 --> 00:01:31.384
<i>And then it changed pretty quickly
when I started lying...</i>

00:01:31.551 --> 00:01:34.179
<i>...about some very personal things.</i>

00:01:34.345 --> 00:01:38.141
<i>So let the record show that I,
Olive Penderghast...</i>

00:01:38.308 --> 00:01:43.062
<i>...being of sound mind,
and below-average breast size...</i>

00:01:43.313 --> 00:01:45.398
<i>...swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth...</i>

00:01:45.565 --> 00:01:48.651
<i>...and nothing but the truth.
Starting now.</i>

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.905
<i>And what better way
to share my private thoughts...</i>

00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:53.990
<i>...than to broadcast them
on the Internet?</i>

00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:57.494
So here it is. Part one.

00:01:58.495 --> 00:02:02.665
The shudder-inducing and clichéd,
however totally false account...

00:02:02.832 --> 00:02:07.045
...of how I lost my virginity
to a guy at a community college.

00:02:07.587 --> 00:02:12.050
Let me just begin by saying
that there are two sides to every story.

00:02:12.217 --> 00:02:15.136
And this is my side, the right one.

00:02:15.303 --> 00:02:17.055
George is not a sexy name.

00:02:17.222 --> 00:02:19.140
George is what you name
your teddy bear...

00:02:19.307 --> 00:02:21.643
...not the name you wanna
scream out during climax.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.562
And by that, I assume you mean...?

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:27.273
The stable and self-perpetuating
end stage...

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.317
...in the evolution
of a plant community.

00:02:29.484 --> 00:02:31.152
- Right.
- Why, what were you thinking?

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.240
The same. But I don't say it out loud
lest someone get the wrong idea.

00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:38.326
I think you know innuendo
is attached to everything these days.

00:02:38.493 --> 00:02:40.537
Innuendo? What...?
Whatever do you mean?

00:02:40.703 --> 00:02:44.207
Rhiannon, Olive, go hit the books.
They don't hit back.

00:02:44.374 --> 00:02:48.920
Also, hugs not drugs.
Mess with the bull, get the horns.

00:02:49.087 --> 00:02:51.673
And any other clichés
you can come up with.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.300
Bye, Mr. Griffith.

00:02:54.467 --> 00:02:55.760
Bye.

00:02:55.927 --> 00:02:58.388
- Watch your mouth.
- Sorry.

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:00.890
<i>Mr. Griffith is my favourite teacher.</i>

00:03:01.057 --> 00:03:03.017
<i>Although,
after all the trouble I caused...</i>

00:03:03.184 --> 00:03:05.436
<i>...I don't know if I'm still
his favourite student.</i>

00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:07.063
You know, these are bad for you.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.733
It leads to unwanted pregnancy,
all sorts of things.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.737
Mismatched tyres on your vehicle,
which is nonexistent.

00:03:14.904 --> 00:03:19.200
<i>And here is where the trouble began.
The lie that started the whole thing.</i>

00:03:19.367 --> 00:03:23.246
Please, please, I'm begging you.
I will pay you. I'll pay you.

00:03:23.413 --> 00:03:25.248
Rhi, I cannot go camping
with you, okay?

00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:27.125
I'm sorry, but I have a date.

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:29.919
- Okay? I told you.
- With who?

00:03:30.628 --> 00:03:33.423
- You don't know him.
- And neither do you, you selfish bitch.

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.925
Yes, I do.
He goes to college with my brother.

00:03:36.092 --> 00:03:37.677
Okay. What's his name, then?

00:03:37.844 --> 00:03:40.680
<i>Rhiannon is what you'd call
a strong personality.</i>

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:43.141
<i>She asked me to come camping
with her family...</i>

00:03:43.308 --> 00:03:45.226
<i>...and I don't know why
I didn't wanna go.</i>

00:03:45.393 --> 00:03:48.605
<i>A little because I didn't feel like
hanging out with her all weekend.</i>

00:03:48.771 --> 00:03:52.108
<i>But mostly because her parents are
the weirdest people I have ever met...</i>

00:03:52.275 --> 00:03:54.569
<i>...and I live in California.</i>

00:03:54.736 --> 00:03:57.280
<i>I ate dinner at her house once
and I swore, never again.</i>

00:03:57.447 --> 00:03:59.741
- This is interesting.
- Patchouli burger.

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:01.993
We grew it in our victory garden.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.620
You want some dessert?

00:04:03.786 --> 00:04:06.247
No, thank you.
I'm trying to watch my figure.

00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:08.207
Well, I'm not.

00:04:09.334 --> 00:04:11.169
<i>So I lied and told her I couldn't go...</i>

00:04:11.336 --> 00:04:14.422
<i>...because I had a date with a friend
of my brother's named George.</i>

00:04:14.589 --> 00:04:17.675
Let's just face it, there is no such thing
as a sexy George.

00:04:17.842 --> 00:04:19.260
Yeah, well, mine is...

00:04:19.427 --> 00:04:22.931
...so I think we should just
put this conversation to bed.

00:04:23.097 --> 00:04:26.851
Fine, don't go camping with us.
Just know I hate you, bitch.

00:04:27.477 --> 00:04:29.354
Go get your chocolate milk.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.649
- Do you want one?
- No.

00:04:32.815 --> 00:04:35.443
<i>And here's how I really spent
the weekend.</i>

00:04:44.577 --> 00:04:46.454
That's the worst song ever.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:36.379
<i>But on Monday, when Rhi asked me
how my weekend was....</i>

00:05:36.546 --> 00:05:39.215
He was charming, you know?
He was a real gentleman.

00:05:39.382 --> 00:05:42.635
And it feels like I got a love
and I know that it's all mine.

00:05:42.802 --> 00:05:45.555
Okay, okay. Wait, wait.
So are you going to see him again?

00:05:45.722 --> 00:05:49.017
No. No, probably not. You know,
it was just one of those weekends.

00:05:49.183 --> 00:05:50.768
A whole weekend?

00:05:50.935 --> 00:05:52.437
Yup.

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:55.565
- Wait a minute. You didn't have...?
- What?

00:05:55.898 --> 00:05:57.734
No. No, of course not.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:01.070
You liar.
You totally lost your V-card to him.

00:06:01.237 --> 00:06:02.864
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

00:06:03.031 --> 00:06:05.575
- Tell me everything.
- Rhi, I'm not that kind of girl.

00:06:05.742 --> 00:06:08.077
The kind that does it,
or the kind that does it...

00:06:08.244 --> 00:06:10.580
...and doesn't have the balls
to tell her friend?

00:06:10.747 --> 00:06:12.415
- What?
- I want every detail.

00:06:12.582 --> 00:06:13.916
- Rhi.
- Now, bitch.

00:06:14.083 --> 00:06:16.002
You know, you call me "bitch" a lot.
Okay?

00:06:16.169 --> 00:06:19.297
- It's not a term of endearment.
- I want every detail. Now, shitface.

00:06:19.464 --> 00:06:21.424
You're not heading
in the right direction.

00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:23.009
Tell me.

00:06:23.176 --> 00:06:24.761
Fine.

00:06:25.678 --> 00:06:27.305
We did it.

00:06:27.472 --> 00:06:28.598
Yes!

00:06:28.765 --> 00:06:31.059
Finally.
Now you're a super slut like me.

00:06:31.225 --> 00:06:33.686
I don't think letting Peter Hedlund
motorboat you...

00:06:33.853 --> 00:06:36.939
...behind a Bed Bath & Beyond
really makes you a super slut.

00:06:37.106 --> 00:06:40.401
There were a lot of people walking
past. Someone could've easily seen.

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.280
Whatever. This isn't about me,
this is about you.

00:06:44.447 --> 00:06:45.490
What'd you let him do?

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.578
It was normal. You know?
Nothing freaky.

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:52.997
<i>I don't know why I did it.</i>

00:06:53.164 --> 00:06:55.625
<i>I guess maybe it was because
it was the first time...</i>

00:06:55.792 --> 00:06:58.252
<i>...I had sort of felt superior to Rhi.</i>

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:01.798
<i>But I just started piling on lie after lie.
It was like setting up Jenga.</i>

00:07:01.964 --> 00:07:03.466
Do you know, like, Glade candles?

00:07:03.633 --> 00:07:06.969
Those kind, but they were, like,
sexy Glade candles.

00:07:07.136 --> 00:07:09.847
- He was sweet. He was....
- Of course.

00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:17.230
What the hell are you looking at,
Sister Christian?

00:07:17.396 --> 00:07:19.774
Just a couple of admitted whores.

00:07:22.026 --> 00:07:24.862
<i>Marianne Bryant is the secretary
of the student council...</i>

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:27.448
<i>...chairman of the Orange Blossom
dance committee...</i>

00:07:27.615 --> 00:07:29.826
<i>...and president of
the Cross Your Heart Club...</i>

00:07:29.992 --> 00:07:33.037
<i>...a club dedicated to shoving
their beliefs down people's throats.</i>

00:07:33.204 --> 00:07:34.664
Obviously they don't care.

00:07:34.831 --> 00:07:37.792
<i>Last year's cause célèbre was
the changing of the school mascot.</i>

00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:42.046
Give it up for your Blue Devils!

00:07:42.505 --> 00:07:44.215
Blue!

00:07:44.382 --> 00:07:46.759
Blue Devil!

00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:50.680
Yeah.

00:07:51.305 --> 00:07:53.683
Yeah!

00:07:54.851 --> 00:07:57.770
How can we exhibit school pride
when we're conveyed to others...

00:07:57.937 --> 00:07:59.564
...as Satan worshippers?

00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:03.192
<i>Now, thankfully,
we're the much less intimidating....</i>

00:08:04.527 --> 00:08:06.529
Give it up for the Woodchucks!

00:08:06.696 --> 00:08:08.990
Hey! Go, Woodchucks!

00:08:09.157 --> 00:08:11.450
Woodchucks!

00:08:17.957 --> 00:08:20.084
I liked Todd much better
when he was topless.

00:08:20.251 --> 00:08:23.421
Yeah, but even dressed as a
woodchuck, I still fantasise about him.

00:08:23.963 --> 00:08:25.214
Woodchucks.

00:08:27.925 --> 00:08:30.052
<i>Now Marianne had
a new cause célèbre.</i>

00:08:30.636 --> 00:08:31.721
<i>Me.</i>

00:08:31.888 --> 00:08:34.348
Which brings us to part two.

00:08:34.515 --> 00:08:38.269
The accelerated velocity
of terminological inexactitude.

00:08:38.436 --> 00:08:43.107
<i>Which is really just my obnoxious way
of saying that lies travel fast.</i>

00:08:43.274 --> 00:08:47.904
<i>And, boy, did my terminological
inexactitude accelerate with velocity.</i>

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.947
Did you hear about Olive?

00:09:10.801 --> 00:09:12.637
No way.

00:09:20.811 --> 00:09:23.105
- She's not a virgin anymore?
- I can't believe it.

00:09:23.272 --> 00:09:25.107
- Olive lost her virginity.
- Yeah.

00:09:26.359 --> 00:09:29.445
Maybe next time a certain somebody
will be a little more careful...

00:09:29.612 --> 00:09:31.322
...what she says in the water closet.

00:09:31.489 --> 00:09:34.617
Yeah, about that? It's...
That's actually not what you think.

00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:36.953
Can I talk to you alone
for a second?

00:09:37.119 --> 00:09:40.248
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:44.168
Bye, Nina.

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:49.173
What you heard in the bathroom
the other day wasn't true at all.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.802
- It's actually a funny story.
- Olive. That's your name, right?

00:09:53.219 --> 00:09:56.305
Yeah, yeah. And you're Marianne.

00:09:56.472 --> 00:09:58.849
We've had nine classes together
since kindergarten.

00:09:59.016 --> 00:10:02.019
Ten, if you count Religion
of Other Cultures, which you didn't...

00:10:02.186 --> 00:10:04.146
...because you refused to go.

00:10:04.313 --> 00:10:06.983
Yeah. Listen, I'm not the one
that you have to answer to...

00:10:07.149 --> 00:10:08.567
...for your depraved behaviour.

00:10:08.734 --> 00:10:11.612
There's a higher power
that will judge you for your indecency.

00:10:11.779 --> 00:10:13.656
Tom Cruise?

00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:16.242
I hope for your sake
that God has a sense of humour.

00:10:16.409 --> 00:10:20.037
Oh, I have 17 years' worth
of anecdotal proof he does.

00:10:20.871 --> 00:10:22.123
You've made your bed.

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:24.959
I just hope for your sake
that you've cleaned the sheets.

00:10:26.877 --> 00:10:28.671
- Did I just get saved?
- I missed you.

00:10:28.838 --> 00:10:30.006
Oh, you too.

00:10:30.172 --> 00:10:32.550
<i>So Marianne spread the rumour.</i>

00:10:32.717 --> 00:10:36.053
<i>For the first time ever, my sexual
exploits were the talk of the school.</i>

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:38.681
<i>Oh, you know what? I'm wrong.
It was the second time.</i>

00:10:38.848 --> 00:10:40.850
<i>The first time was back
in 8th grade...</i>

00:10:41.017 --> 00:10:44.687
<i>...when all I wanted was a kiss from
this guy I had always had a crush on.</i>

00:10:44.854 --> 00:10:48.107
<i>Todd and I were thrown together
in Seven Minutes of Heaven.</i>

00:10:48.274 --> 00:10:52.945
<i>Luckily we had a super romantic
song from our youth to set the mood.</i>

00:10:54.739 --> 00:10:56.032
I think this is the part...

00:10:56.198 --> 00:10:58.868
...where you're supposed to
stick your tongue in my mouth.

00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:00.578
That's what I've heard, anyway.

00:11:00.745 --> 00:11:02.955
Just give me a second, okay?

00:11:03.122 --> 00:11:05.875
According to my watch,
you have 382 of them.

00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:07.293
- How do you do that?
- What?

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:09.754
Add so fast.
And you also talk like a grown-up.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:13.215
Don't worry, I'm not nearly as smart
as I think I am.

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:19.221
So if we didn't do anything,
could you still tell people we kissed?

00:11:22.058 --> 00:11:23.517
Absolutely.

00:11:23.976 --> 00:11:25.853
- Thanks, Olive.
- Sure, Todd.

00:11:27.104 --> 00:11:28.898
<i>I actually didn't wanna lie that time.</i>

00:11:29.065 --> 00:11:31.692
<i>When people thought
I'd kissed someone, they didn't care.</i>

00:11:31.859 --> 00:11:33.944
<i>But when they thought
I slept with someone....</i>

00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.572
Hey, Olive. How's it going?

00:11:36.739 --> 00:11:39.408
I'm swell,
Guy-I've-Never-Talked-to-Before.

00:11:39.575 --> 00:11:41.494
Thanks for asking.

00:11:42.119 --> 00:11:46.916
<i>All I could think to myself was,
"Great, now I'm a tramp."</i>

00:11:47.083 --> 00:11:49.085
<i>I'm gonna have to get
a lower-back tattoo...</i>

00:11:49.251 --> 00:11:51.545
<i>...and pierce something
not on my face.</i>

00:11:51.921 --> 00:11:54.215
You guys know that
I was here all weekend, right?

00:11:54.382 --> 00:11:55.800
- Yeah.
- Yes, you were upstairs.

00:11:55.966 --> 00:11:57.510
- Yeah.
- You would testify to that?

00:11:57.676 --> 00:11:59.637
- Yeah.
- I would take a bullet for you.

00:11:59.804 --> 00:12:01.555
You know that.
Right between the eyes.

00:12:01.722 --> 00:12:04.016
Man, I would slit my throat...

00:12:04.183 --> 00:12:06.102
...rather than say something
to someone...

00:12:06.268 --> 00:12:08.938
- ...that you didn't want me to say.
- That's not necessary.

00:12:09.105 --> 00:12:11.899
- But that is comforting.
- That's how I am, how I roll.

00:12:12.066 --> 00:12:13.818
That's how I do, as they say.

00:12:13.984 --> 00:12:17.530
- I like the pants.
- Thank you. They're Costco.

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.573
You can have them
when you get taller.

00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.243
- I'm never gonna go through puberty.
- Course you will.

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.286
But we're a family of late bloomers.

00:12:24.453 --> 00:12:27.206
I didn't until I was 14. Nor did Olive.

00:12:27.373 --> 00:12:29.291
Why does that matter? I'm adopted.

00:12:29.708 --> 00:12:33.170
What? Oh, my God. Who told you?

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:36.715
Guys, we were gonna do this
at the right time.

00:12:36.882 --> 00:12:37.925
Listen to me.

00:12:38.092 --> 00:12:41.220
Sometimes, even when a man and
a woman love each other very much...

00:12:41.387 --> 00:12:43.055
...like your mother and I used to...

00:12:43.222 --> 00:12:45.933
...their insides just don't cooperate
with each other.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.351
So, what's going on, honey?

00:12:47.518 --> 00:12:50.646
Why do you want us to take a bullet
if anyone asks if you were here?

00:12:50.813 --> 00:12:53.149
It's nothing. It's just the rumour mill.

00:12:53.315 --> 00:12:56.485
What's the rumour mill churning out
these days? Anything interesting?

00:12:56.652 --> 00:12:59.697
You know, not really. Not really.
It's a little low on grist.

00:12:59.864 --> 00:13:02.658
Clever wordplay. I like it.
You must be related to me.

00:13:02.825 --> 00:13:04.994
- Only by marriage.
- Give it to me.

00:13:05.161 --> 00:13:07.496
So, what we're all gonna take away
from this:

00:13:07.663 --> 00:13:10.374
- I was here all weekend, right?
- Yes, yes, yes.

00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:13.836
<i>Remember how I told you
Google Earth couldn't find me...</i>

00:13:14.003 --> 00:13:16.130
<i>...if I was dressed up
as a ten-storey building?</i>

00:13:16.297 --> 00:13:20.092
<i>Well, the next day it could find me if I
was dressed as a crack on a sidewalk.</i>

00:13:20.259 --> 00:13:22.511
<i>That's the beauty of being
a girl in high school.</i>

00:13:22.678 --> 00:13:26.182
<i>People hear you had sex once
and, bam, you're a bimbo.</i>

00:13:26.348 --> 00:13:28.893
<i>I really didn't mean for the lie
to put me on the map...</i>

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:32.229
<i>...but I gotta admit,
I kind of liked being on the map.</i>

00:13:32.396 --> 00:13:36.650
So, clearly Nathaniel Hawthorne
is a complex writer.

00:13:36.817 --> 00:13:38.444
Even I had trouble with him.

00:13:38.611 --> 00:13:41.697
I read him originally when I was 5,
but I struggled.

00:13:41.864 --> 00:13:44.825
So I'm gonna break it down for you.
I'm gonna throw some rhymes.

00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:46.994
Anson, drop me a beat.

00:13:47.161 --> 00:13:48.871
- What?
- Give me a beat.

00:13:49.038 --> 00:13:50.915
Push it up.

00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:54.668
<i>Yeah, adultery, vengeance</i>

00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:57.171
<i>Crimes of passion</i>

00:13:57.338 --> 00:13:59.381
Kill the beat.
I'm not gonna rap for you.

00:13:59.548 --> 00:14:01.592
It's pandering
and it's been done before...

00:14:01.759 --> 00:14:04.887
...in every bad movie
you've ever seen. Okay.

00:14:05.054 --> 00:14:07.681
<i>Ironically, we were studying</i>
The Scarlet Letter.

00:14:07.848 --> 00:14:09.725
<i>Now, isn't that always the way?</i>

00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:13.062
<i>The books you read in class always
have some strong connection...</i>

00:14:13.229 --> 00:14:16.065
<i>...with whatever angsty
adolescent drama is going on.</i>

00:14:16.232 --> 00:14:19.193
<i>Except for</i> Huckleberry Finn.
<i>I don't know any teenage boys...</i>

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.946
<i>...who have ever run away
with a big, hulking black guy.</i>

00:14:22.363 --> 00:14:24.573
For those who haven't read
<i>The Scarlet Letter...</i>

00:14:24.740 --> 00:14:28.410
...or for those who said you did
but didn't, here's all you need to know.

00:14:28.577 --> 00:14:31.413
<i>This girl, Hester Prynne,
has an affair with a minister...</i>

00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:35.417
<i>...is besmirched and made to wear
a red A for "adulterer."</i>

00:14:35.584 --> 00:14:37.878
<i>The town realises
she was too harshly judged...</i>

00:14:38.045 --> 00:14:40.923
<i>...and she's really a good person,
and she dies a saint.</i>

00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:42.925
<i>A whole bunch
of other stuff happens too.</i>

00:14:43.092 --> 00:14:46.637
If you have a test on it, rent the movie,
but make sure it's the original...

00:14:46.804 --> 00:14:50.432
...not the Demi Moore version where
she talks in a fake British accent...

00:14:50.599 --> 00:14:52.351
...and takes a lot of baths.

00:14:52.518 --> 00:14:57.439
To say that one was freely adapted
is a bit of an understatement, guvnor.

00:14:57.606 --> 00:14:59.608
What we have to realise...

00:14:59.775 --> 00:15:03.070
...is that Hester lived
in an entirely different time.

00:15:03.237 --> 00:15:09.451
A time when the worst crime a woman
could commit was in fact adultery.

00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:11.287
Nina.

00:15:11.453 --> 00:15:13.414
I think Hester Prynne was...

00:15:13.581 --> 00:15:16.125
Excuse my language.... a skank.

00:15:16.292 --> 00:15:18.752
A skank? So you don't think
she was a victim at all?

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:21.130
Why should I?
She brought it on herself.

00:15:22.464 --> 00:15:26.969
Perhaps you should embroider a red A
on your wardrobe, abominable tramp.

00:15:27.136 --> 00:15:30.973
Perhaps you should get a wardrobe,
you abominable twat.

00:15:32.641 --> 00:15:35.144
<i>Not my best line,
but it was provocative enough...</i>

00:15:35.311 --> 00:15:37.813
<i>...to land me in the principal's office.</i>

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:47.656
Seems as if someone's
on a downward spiral.

00:15:48.032 --> 00:15:51.368
Seems as if someone's
practising the mundane activities...

00:15:51.535 --> 00:15:53.704
...she'll be saddled with
the rest of her life.

00:15:53.871 --> 00:15:56.665
I hope you at least had the good sense
to use protection.

00:15:56.832 --> 00:15:58.292
Why? Your parents didn't.

00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:01.170
- You're going to hell.
- Just as long as you won't be there.

00:16:01.337 --> 00:16:03.172
I can assure you I won't.

00:16:03.756 --> 00:16:05.674
Good.

00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:14.058
I don't care who started it.
Just work it out.

00:16:18.646 --> 00:16:19.688
Penderghast.

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:23.901
So why am I just meeting you?

00:16:24.068 --> 00:16:26.654
Language like this would've
warranted a visit years ago.

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:30.866
This is the first time I've done anything
remotely misbehavioural.

00:16:31.033 --> 00:16:32.159
This is foul.

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:34.578
I know. I am so...
I'm really, really sorry.

00:16:34.745 --> 00:16:37.039
Sorry you said it
or sorry you got caught?

00:16:37.206 --> 00:16:39.166
Sorry I said it, honestly.

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:42.961
And sorry I got caught a little bit too,
but mostly just sorry I said it.

00:16:43.128 --> 00:16:47.049
If you use a word like this again in my
school, it'll be your last. Understand?

00:16:47.216 --> 00:16:48.258
Yes, sir. Yes.

00:16:48.425 --> 00:16:50.886
I mean, this isn't one of
those progressive schools...

00:16:51.053 --> 00:16:53.555
...where teachers are called
by their first names...

00:16:53.722 --> 00:16:56.350
...and students
are partners in learning...

00:16:56.517 --> 00:16:59.478
...and there's a fundraising auction
at the end of the year...

00:16:59.645 --> 00:17:02.898
...where the more creative parents
put on musical skits...

00:17:03.065 --> 00:17:05.067
...about the community garden.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:07.945
This is public school.

00:17:08.112 --> 00:17:12.533
If I can keep the girls off the pole and
the boys off the pipe, I get a bonus.

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.244
Now, if you're sent to me
one more time...

00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:18.789
...you're gonna be out on your fantail.
Now, am I making myself clear?

00:17:18.956 --> 00:17:20.082
Yes, sir.

00:17:20.958 --> 00:17:22.042
- Good.
- I think so.

00:17:22.209 --> 00:17:26.130
I mean, I got a little lost in the middle,
but I found my way back.

00:17:26.296 --> 00:17:28.090
Detention after school tomorrow.

00:17:28.257 --> 00:17:31.260
Now, out.

00:17:32.928 --> 00:17:36.974
<i>Even though it was my slutty alter ego
that said a bad word in school...</i>

00:17:37.141 --> 00:17:39.393
<i>...it was my ass that got in trouble...</i>

00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.563
<i>...which was a place my ass
had never been before.</i>

00:17:47.609 --> 00:17:49.194
Hey, Olive.

00:17:49.528 --> 00:17:52.156
Oh, my God. The illusion is shattered.

00:17:52.322 --> 00:17:55.784
They put you in the gas chamber if you
take your head off at Disney World.

00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.620
I think they just fire you.
You're thinking of Disneyland.

00:17:58.787 --> 00:18:00.622
- Disney World is more liberal.
- Oh, yeah.

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:03.667
I always forget Disney World
went blue in the last election.

00:18:03.834 --> 00:18:05.711
Are you going
to Melody Bostic's party?

00:18:05.961 --> 00:18:07.463
I hadn't planned on it.

00:18:07.629 --> 00:18:10.674
Me neither. My cousin's getting
married. It's a rehearsal dinner.

00:18:10.841 --> 00:18:13.469
See you. Stay excellent.

00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:14.970
You too.

00:18:15.137 --> 00:18:16.430
- What's up, kid?
- Woodchuck.

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:19.933
Please tell me the rumours are true.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.561
Yes. Yes. I am a big, fat slut.

00:18:22.728 --> 00:18:26.190
No, the one where you got suspended
for calling Nina Howell a dick...

00:18:26.356 --> 00:18:28.442
...and punching her in the left tit.

00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:32.112
I worry about the way information
circulates at this school.

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.449
Rhi? I need to tell you something.

00:18:35.616 --> 00:18:38.494
Like the exact moment
you turned into such a badass?

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.496
- I think I'm in love with you.
- Okay.

00:18:40.662 --> 00:18:43.332
Tell me you left a mark
on that scrunched-up face of hers?

00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:45.334
- It's not true.
- It wasn't the left tit?

00:18:45.501 --> 00:18:48.337
It was the right one.
I always pegged you for a southpaw.

00:18:48.504 --> 00:18:51.089
Can you listen to me
for one second, please?

00:18:51.256 --> 00:18:54.468
Okay. It didn't happen.

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:58.514
Oh, yeah, right. Your secret's safe
with me, you little sex monkey.

00:19:03.101 --> 00:19:05.145
I got sent to the principal today.

00:19:05.312 --> 00:19:07.397
Did you win a medal or something?

00:19:07.564 --> 00:19:08.607
Not exactly.

00:19:08.774 --> 00:19:13.362
I used inappropriate language
in English class.

00:19:13.529 --> 00:19:16.532
Although, we're reading a book
that I personally deem...

00:19:16.698 --> 00:19:20.536
...inappropriate for our age group,
so I actually felt it was quite apropos.

00:19:20.702 --> 00:19:21.954
What did you say?

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.208
Let's just say
it was an inappropriate word.

00:19:26.375 --> 00:19:27.709
Well, what did it start with?

00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:30.254
A snide comment
from a snotty girl in my class.

00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:33.799
No, I mean what letter
did the word start with?

00:19:33.966 --> 00:19:35.592
- T.
- Oh, T.

00:19:35.759 --> 00:19:40.222
- T? Let us think. T, T, T.
- T. All right, T. Yeah, T.

00:19:40.389 --> 00:19:44.726
- T, T, T.
- T, T, T.

00:19:55.737 --> 00:19:57.739
- Guys.
- Noun, adjective or verb?

00:19:57.906 --> 00:20:01.034
Noun. It's definitely slang.
Think British.

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:03.078
Tallywhacker? Termagant?

00:20:06.748 --> 00:20:08.834
You're just saying sounds.
Those are sounds.

00:20:09.001 --> 00:20:11.920
- Spell it with your peas.
- Yeah, spell it with your peas. Do it.

00:20:12.087 --> 00:20:13.755
- I will take that challenge.
- Do it.

00:20:13.922 --> 00:20:15.257
I like that. All right.

00:20:15.424 --> 00:20:17.718
So does this have anything to do
with the rumour...

00:20:17.885 --> 00:20:19.928
...that you mentioned the other night?

00:20:20.095 --> 00:20:23.390
Do you need to talk to us
about something, sweetie?

00:20:23.557 --> 00:20:25.517
What's a twit?

00:20:25.684 --> 00:20:27.436
That's an A, honey.

00:20:27.603 --> 00:20:29.855
It'll get you sent
to the principal's office.

00:20:30.022 --> 00:20:31.189
Sit down.

00:20:31.356 --> 00:20:33.901
We're lucky that this
is not a common occurrence.

00:20:34.067 --> 00:20:36.111
What would my punishment
have been otherwise?

00:20:36.278 --> 00:20:39.865
- Bed without supper, I guess.
- But I'm already finished.

00:20:40.699 --> 00:20:43.285
- No dating. No dating.
- Yeah, no dating.

00:20:43.452 --> 00:20:45.454
- No dating for you, young lady.
- No dating.

00:20:45.621 --> 00:20:47.873
I think my complete lack of allure...

00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.626
...already kind of
shot that horse in the face.

00:20:50.792 --> 00:20:53.962
I wouldn't know how to be grounded
more than you know how to ground.

00:20:54.129 --> 00:20:56.465
That's right. Love you. Come here.

00:20:56.632 --> 00:21:00.344
And I bet that girl was acting
like exactly what you called her.

00:21:00.510 --> 00:21:01.637
Oh, you have no idea.

00:21:03.805 --> 00:21:06.308
I got a B-plus
on my spelling test today.

00:21:06.475 --> 00:21:10.062
That's good, honey, but everything
has spell check these days, so....

00:21:10.228 --> 00:21:11.396
Just kidding.

00:21:13.649 --> 00:21:15.567
Where are you from originally?

00:21:16.068 --> 00:21:17.694
<i>So the next day I had detention...</i>

00:21:17.861 --> 00:21:21.156
<i>...which, thanks to recent budget cuts,
meant cleaning.</i>

00:21:21.323 --> 00:21:23.742
<i>I was looking forward to
getting all this behind me.</i>

00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:26.495
<i>I had done the crime,
I was gonna do the time.</i>

00:21:26.662 --> 00:21:28.872
<i>And that would be that,
but that....</i>

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:31.833
Aren't there, like,
child labour laws against this?

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.126
Not in high school.

00:21:33.293 --> 00:21:37.464
The principal's like the captain
of the ship in international waters.

00:21:37.631 --> 00:21:39.257
He can even marry people.

00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:42.928
We haven't talked in a while.
How have you been, Brandon?

00:21:43.095 --> 00:21:46.765
Fabulous. I'm crushing it.
Everything according to plan.

00:21:46.932 --> 00:21:48.934
I wanna be in detention.

00:21:49.101 --> 00:21:50.352
Yeah, why are you here?

00:21:50.519 --> 00:21:53.981
From the blood I saw gushing out of
your nose, I thought you were bullied.

00:21:54.147 --> 00:21:57.526
Principal Gibbons is a homophobe,
which is why I called him a fascist.

00:21:57.693 --> 00:22:01.029
- So the rumours are true.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

00:22:01.196 --> 00:22:03.824
I meant about
Gibbons being a fascist.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:08.370
So, what's with your new look?
Very whore couture.

00:22:08.537 --> 00:22:11.873
Oh, haven't you heard?
I'm the new school slut.

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:15.627
You know, I did hear something.
I also heard he was twice your age.

00:22:15.794 --> 00:22:18.380
Oh, no, no, no.
No, he was a freshman in college.

00:22:18.547 --> 00:22:20.674
I also heard he gave you crabs.

00:22:20.841 --> 00:22:23.552
- People suck.
- Tell me about it.

00:22:26.013 --> 00:22:27.139
He's not real.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:31.893
- What?
- The guy I slept with. I made him up.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.062
Wait, you started the rumour?

00:22:34.229 --> 00:22:36.273
Indirectly, I guess sort of.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:40.736
Or actually, no.
No, not really. No, I didn't.

00:22:40.902 --> 00:22:43.864
Well, but you're perpetuating it.
That's really messed up.

00:22:44.031 --> 00:22:45.157
Excuse me?

00:22:45.323 --> 00:22:48.410
You're not even a real slut,
you just want people to think you are.

00:22:48.577 --> 00:22:50.078
It's pathetic.

00:22:50.245 --> 00:22:55.083
No offence, but you could probably
learn something from me, Brando.

00:22:55.250 --> 00:22:59.963
Are you saying that I should
act straight so people will like me?

00:23:00.130 --> 00:23:03.925
That's groundbreaking. You should
teach a course at The Learning Annex.

00:23:04.092 --> 00:23:07.179
It could be called "The Painfully
Obvious with Olive Penderghast...

00:23:07.345 --> 00:23:08.638
...the Fake School Slut."

00:23:08.805 --> 00:23:11.933
I was just suggesting that
maybe these kids we call peers...

00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.770
...are onto something.
You know, like Marianne Bryant.

00:23:14.936 --> 00:23:19.900
Maybe that whole stuck-up,
Jesus-freak thing is an act. You know?

00:23:20.067 --> 00:23:22.444
No, I think she's just
a stuck-up Jesus freak.

00:23:22.611 --> 00:23:25.864
And there are some of us who are
just trying to blend in to the crowd.

00:23:26.031 --> 00:23:29.034
Well, then you've gotta do
everything you can to blend in...

00:23:29.201 --> 00:23:30.952
...or decide not to care.

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.873
I can't decide if you're a genius
or a lunatic.

00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:39.044
Well, don't they sort of go
hand in hand?

00:23:40.837 --> 00:23:43.924
- So you heard any word from George?
- Nope.

00:23:44.091 --> 00:23:48.804
I told you, that was a one-night stand,
which is now over.

00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:51.056
You're being pretty cavalier
about this.

00:23:51.223 --> 00:23:53.642
Aren't you supposed to be
eternally in love with him?

00:23:53.809 --> 00:23:57.479
Yes, I believe so. If I was a Gossip Girl
in Sweet Valley with travelling pants.

00:23:57.646 --> 00:24:01.983
But no, I'm not.
So I could really care less.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:04.319
So Brandy Carter
was telling Vanessa Hodges...

00:24:04.486 --> 00:24:07.322
...that you were with three guys
in a Jacuzzi.

00:24:07.989 --> 00:24:09.407
Sounds like a lot of work.

00:24:09.574 --> 00:24:13.120
I guess that's still better than
getting it on with some old dude.

00:24:13.286 --> 00:24:14.621
Who said that?

00:24:14.788 --> 00:24:18.750
Do you know that Brandon kid?
That's what somebody told him.

00:24:18.917 --> 00:24:20.001
Isn't he a homo?

00:24:20.794 --> 00:24:22.003
Yeah.

00:24:28.093 --> 00:24:29.970
Speak of the devil. Hello.

00:24:30.137 --> 00:24:32.848
I was just talking about you
with my friend, Rhiannon.

00:24:33.014 --> 00:24:36.434
You know Rhiannon.
She's perpetually angry.

00:24:36.601 --> 00:24:38.687
She curses like a Somali sailor. Bi...

00:24:38.854 --> 00:24:41.314
- Yeah. That's the one.
- "Bi... "? "Bi... "? What's "bi-"?

00:24:41.481 --> 00:24:44.151
- Okay.
- I wanna know what "bi..." is.

00:24:44.317 --> 00:24:46.027
Hello, what's "bi... "? What is "bi... "?

00:24:46.194 --> 00:24:48.280
- Bye.
- "Bi... "? What is "bi... "?

00:24:48.446 --> 00:24:51.449
Bedazzling personality?
Beautiful, beautiful soul?

00:24:51.616 --> 00:24:54.202
- Big tits.
- That's my identifier?

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.621
Yes!

00:24:56.788 --> 00:25:00.542
All right, well, that was Brandon. He
needs to talk to me about something.

00:25:00.709 --> 00:25:03.587
- Probably wants to borrow an outfit.
- Whatever, Big Tits.

00:25:03.753 --> 00:25:05.297
Heck, yeah!

00:25:06.047 --> 00:25:07.883
Big tits!

00:25:08.049 --> 00:25:10.844
The next day,
things took a turn for the scandalous...

00:25:11.011 --> 00:25:12.971
...which brings us to part three.

00:25:13.138 --> 00:25:16.892
A lady's choice
and a gentleman's agreement.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:32.908
Hi. Is there an Olive here?

00:25:33.074 --> 00:25:35.243
There's a whole jar of them
in the fridge.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:37.579
I'm sorry,
I must have the wrong address.

00:25:37.746 --> 00:25:39.080
Just kidding. Come on in.

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.168
Any friend of Olive's
is a friend of our daughter's.

00:25:43.793 --> 00:25:45.337
Olive, sweetie.

00:25:45.503 --> 00:25:47.589
There's a young man
here to see you.

00:25:47.756 --> 00:25:51.426
He said something about asking
for your hand in marriage.

00:25:51.593 --> 00:25:53.887
Oh, happy day, Mama!

00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:56.389
Oh, I thought I was gonna have
to spend my dowry...

00:25:56.556 --> 00:25:59.392
...on booze and pills
to numb the loneliness.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:01.895
A gentleman caller, hurray!

00:26:02.062 --> 00:26:04.397
- What's that?
- Olive has a boy in her room.

00:26:04.564 --> 00:26:05.732
- A boy?
- A boy.

00:26:05.899 --> 00:26:08.109
- Wow, a boy.
- A boy.

00:26:08.276 --> 00:26:09.945
A boy?

00:26:10.111 --> 00:26:11.947
A boy.

00:26:13.073 --> 00:26:16.451
Welcome.
This is where the magic happens.

00:26:16.618 --> 00:26:18.286
And by magic I mean nothing.

00:26:18.453 --> 00:26:20.080
- Do you wanna go out with me?
- What?

00:26:20.247 --> 00:26:22.916
Well, I mean, like,
do you wanna be my girlfriend?

00:26:25.043 --> 00:26:28.546
Brandon, just a couple hours ago
you told me you were Kinsey Six gay.

00:26:28.713 --> 00:26:31.466
True, but you said I should
pretend to be straight, so....

00:26:31.633 --> 00:26:33.468
Yeah, I didn't mean with me.

00:26:33.635 --> 00:26:38.598
I mean, you're a nice guy and all,
but you're not really my type.

00:26:38.765 --> 00:26:40.558
Yeah, you're not really
my type either.

00:26:40.725 --> 00:26:43.645
Yeah, I know that. I got that V
where you'd rather see a P.

00:26:43.812 --> 00:26:45.480
Do you wanna
have sex with me or not?

00:26:45.647 --> 00:26:47.607
Oh, my God, dude.

00:26:47.774 --> 00:26:49.234
You completely missed the point.

00:26:49.401 --> 00:26:52.153
- That's not what I was saying.
- I know what you were saying.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.823
I should act straight
till I get out of this hellhole.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:57.158
Then I can be whoever I wanna be.
I get that.

00:26:57.325 --> 00:27:00.161
You know that I didn't have sex
with a college guy, right?

00:27:00.328 --> 00:27:02.080
I just told everybody I did.

00:27:02.247 --> 00:27:05.834
Actually, I told one person I did.
And you know how these things work.

00:27:06.001 --> 00:27:07.168
It's like wildfire.

00:27:07.711 --> 00:27:10.922
So you're saying
I shouldn't really have sex?

00:27:11.089 --> 00:27:14.801
I should just say I had sex
with someone. A girl.

00:27:14.968 --> 00:27:17.345
Yes. Yes.

00:27:24.769 --> 00:27:26.354
Oh, no.

00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:29.733
- Wai... Just...
- Oh, no, no, no.

00:27:30.317 --> 00:27:33.028
- No way! No way!
- Just wait. Wait, wait. Stop it, stop it.

00:27:33.194 --> 00:27:35.530
- Absolutely not.
- Think about it. Think about it.

00:27:35.697 --> 00:27:37.949
- We could help each other out.
- No.

00:27:38.116 --> 00:27:40.702
You wanna maintain
this floozy facade.

00:27:40.869 --> 00:27:44.039
I don't wanna get pushed into shit
every day. It's a win-win-win.

00:27:44.205 --> 00:27:46.374
How do you know I like
being thought of as a floozy?

00:27:46.541 --> 00:27:48.626
Because at least
you're being thought of.

00:27:48.793 --> 00:27:51.838
Just one good imaginary bonk.

00:27:52.005 --> 00:27:54.549
You are on crack. All right?
And not the good kind.

00:27:54.716 --> 00:27:56.051
It doesn't have to be a bonk.

00:27:56.217 --> 00:27:58.720
It could be an imaginary butterbean,
lemon squeeze....

00:27:58.887 --> 00:28:02.098
- I don't know what any of that means.
- That's because you're a virgin.

00:28:02.265 --> 00:28:04.392
You know what?
This is not the answer at all.

00:28:04.559 --> 00:28:07.645
- I'll pay you whatever you want.
- I don't want your money, Brandon.

00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:09.814
Just do what I did
and make someone up.

00:28:09.981 --> 00:28:11.858
Who's going to believe me?

00:28:13.651 --> 00:28:17.822
You don't understand how hard it is,
all right? I'm tormented.

00:28:17.989 --> 00:28:22.202
And every day at school
is like I'm being suffocated.

00:28:22.369 --> 00:28:24.746
And sure, we can sit
and fantasise all we want...

00:28:24.913 --> 00:28:27.374
...about how things
are gonna be different one day...

00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.417
...but this is today and it sucks.

00:28:29.584 --> 00:28:32.796
There's only one way around it.
You were smart enough to think of it.

00:28:32.962 --> 00:28:35.548
So please, just help me.

00:28:35.715 --> 00:28:39.386
Because I can't take another day
of this. I don't know what I'll do.

00:28:47.227 --> 00:28:49.771
I don't do anything half-assed.
All right?

00:28:49.938 --> 00:28:51.439
It'll have to be a public event.

00:28:51.606 --> 00:28:54.025
Melody Bostic is throwing
a party tomorrow night.

00:28:54.192 --> 00:28:58.113
All of your tormentors will be there.
You and I are going together. All right?

00:28:58.279 --> 00:29:02.450
You have to do everything I say and
tell everyone that I am sensational.

00:29:02.617 --> 00:29:05.745
- Thank you so much for doing this.
- Just...

00:29:06.371 --> 00:29:09.582
...you know, make sure you're ready
to live with the consequences.

00:29:10.792 --> 00:29:14.712
- What the hell is a lemon squeeze?
- It's like a backwards melon bag.

00:29:14.879 --> 00:29:17.924
How don't I know any of this?

00:29:19.592 --> 00:29:22.470
<i>The next night was the party
at Melody Bostic's house.</i>

00:29:22.637 --> 00:29:24.973
<i>She is the most popular girl
in school.</i>

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.684
<i>It's partly because she's pretty
and has perfect hair...</i>

00:29:27.851 --> 00:29:30.770
<i>...but mostly because her parents
let her have these parties...</i>

00:29:30.937 --> 00:29:33.398
<i>...every time she catches them
doing it in the pool...</i>

00:29:33.565 --> 00:29:36.693
<i>...which is every week, apparently.</i>

00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:39.821
<i>Brandon and I showed up
when it was in full swing.</i>

00:29:39.988 --> 00:29:43.116
<i>I borrowed a dress from my mom,
Brandon borrowed a jacket from me...</i>

00:29:43.283 --> 00:29:45.201
<i>...and we put on a little show.</i>

00:29:45.368 --> 00:29:48.037
Hey, Olive and Brandon.

00:29:48.204 --> 00:29:49.497
What's up?

00:29:49.664 --> 00:29:53.042
I hope you don't mind, but we had
a few pre-cocktail-party cocktails...

00:29:53.209 --> 00:29:56.296
...like, before the cocktail party
with cocktails.

00:29:58.047 --> 00:30:01.134
Listen, here's the sitch,
Melody Bostic.

00:30:01.885 --> 00:30:05.930
Brandon was just in the middle
of telling me this really funny thing...

00:30:06.097 --> 00:30:07.265
...which is really funny.

00:30:07.432 --> 00:30:11.227
And I was wondering if there's,
like, a room where we could go...

00:30:11.394 --> 00:30:14.689
...where he could finish telling me
that thing that's funny...

00:30:14.856 --> 00:30:16.149
...if you know what I mean.

00:30:16.316 --> 00:30:17.609
You can use my room.

00:30:18.776 --> 00:30:20.528
Down the hall to the left.

00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:24.032
Cool.

00:30:25.158 --> 00:30:27.285
Is that Olive with Brandon?

00:30:27.452 --> 00:30:29.370
I know. What the hell, right?

00:30:29.537 --> 00:30:31.247
You guys are my buddies.

00:30:31.414 --> 00:30:33.041
I'm drunk, bitches. What's up?

00:30:33.208 --> 00:30:34.709
I love your room!

00:30:34.876 --> 00:30:37.212
My sheets. Put a towel down.

00:30:37.378 --> 00:30:41.090
- Olive's gonna do a gay dude.
- Thanks. Close the shades.

00:30:45.887 --> 00:30:47.305
- What are you doing?
- Relax.

00:30:47.472 --> 00:30:51.142
Jesus, what is with you gays? Are you
really that repulsed by lady parts?

00:30:51.309 --> 00:30:53.561
What do you think I have down there,
a gnome?

00:30:59.567 --> 00:31:03.655
So nice. What is that, lavender?
It's pretty.

00:31:03.821 --> 00:31:06.533
What are you doing? Can you...?
Can you come here, please?

00:31:06.699 --> 00:31:08.868
Jacket off. Come on.

00:31:09.035 --> 00:31:12.664
All right. Come on.
Chop-chop. All right.

00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:15.208
Now grunt.
Grunt and make it convincing.

00:31:17.126 --> 00:31:19.921
I said grunt, not whine. Just grunt.

00:31:24.092 --> 00:31:26.594
Moan, you know? Like, sex noises.

00:31:28.596 --> 00:31:29.764
God, you are pathetic.

00:31:37.564 --> 00:31:39.440
Good. Good.

00:31:41.776 --> 00:31:44.153
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:31:44.362 --> 00:31:46.114
Oh, yeah.

00:31:46.281 --> 00:31:48.575
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

00:31:52.579 --> 00:31:55.248
- You don't have to be so aggressive.
- You don't like that?

00:31:55.415 --> 00:31:57.458
- No, I don't like that.
- You don't like that?

00:31:57.625 --> 00:31:58.918
How about that?

00:31:59.085 --> 00:32:00.920
- Little better.
- Yeah, you like that.

00:32:01.087 --> 00:32:02.797
I like that.

00:32:02.964 --> 00:32:05.925
- This guy, he's gay, no?
- I think he's gay.

00:32:06.092 --> 00:32:08.595
- Don't stop!
- Keep going.

00:32:08.761 --> 00:32:10.972
- Don't stop.
- I'm not gonna stop.

00:32:11.139 --> 00:32:12.432
I'm not gonna stop.

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:13.975
Now you try. You try.

00:32:14.142 --> 00:32:18.313
I'm gonna turn you around
and take you from the back.

00:32:18.479 --> 00:32:20.982
That's not gonna make people
think you're straight.

00:32:21.149 --> 00:32:25.320
Never mind that gayness
because I'm a straight guy. Roar!

00:32:28.823 --> 00:32:31.326
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

00:32:31.492 --> 00:32:33.661
- That's awesome! That's perfect!
- Yeah!

00:32:33.828 --> 00:32:35.455
That's what I'm talking about!

00:32:35.830 --> 00:32:38.958
Do you smell that?
Do you smell us?

00:32:39.834 --> 00:32:41.836
Did he just say it smelled?

00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:45.006
Isn't it supposed to smell?

00:32:45.173 --> 00:32:46.966
You're not supposed
to comment on it.

00:32:47.133 --> 00:32:51.596
- It doesn't really smell that bad.
- Oh, yeah. Yes, God!

00:32:51.763 --> 00:32:54.807
- Don't stop. Yeah!
- Don't stop. It's too much fun.

00:32:54.974 --> 00:32:57.101
- You ready for the grand finale?
- Yeah. What?

00:32:58.728 --> 00:33:02.565
Oh, yeah.

00:33:02.857 --> 00:33:03.941
Yeah.

00:33:07.987 --> 00:33:09.989
Come on.

00:33:10.156 --> 00:33:11.824
Oh, my God.

00:33:14.452 --> 00:33:17.664
Go forth, my son.
You're a man now.

00:33:19.207 --> 00:33:20.333
Hey.

00:33:21.834 --> 00:33:23.002
Thank you.

00:33:26.130 --> 00:33:29.133
Seriously, thanks.

00:33:37.809 --> 00:33:38.851
- Here.
- What is this?

00:33:39.185 --> 00:33:40.269
Evidence.

00:33:45.441 --> 00:33:48.653
What's up?

00:33:53.574 --> 00:33:55.201
Hey, man.

00:33:55.743 --> 00:33:56.744
How was she?

00:33:56.911 --> 00:34:01.999
Well, well, let's just say
I'll be walking funny tomorrow.

00:34:02.166 --> 00:34:04.001
What?

00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:07.255
- I'm drunk. What's up, bitches?
- Yeah!

00:34:19.058 --> 00:34:21.769
- Whoa, hey.
- Todd, hi.

00:34:21.936 --> 00:34:24.397
I thought you were at
your cousin's rehearsal dinner.

00:34:24.564 --> 00:34:27.275
It was a quick rehearsal.
I only had one line.

00:34:27.942 --> 00:34:28.943
That was a joke.

00:34:29.986 --> 00:34:31.571
I know.

00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:33.865
Yeah, sorry. How's it going?

00:34:34.657 --> 00:34:36.784
You know, I'm...

00:34:37.326 --> 00:34:39.120
- I'm here.
- Can I get you a beer?

00:34:39.287 --> 00:34:41.622
That rhymed. I liked it.

00:34:42.081 --> 00:34:43.541
Yeah.

00:34:52.884 --> 00:34:54.969
- I'm gonna go.
- You sure?

00:34:55.136 --> 00:34:59.140
- Yeah. Bye.
- See you at the salt mines.

00:34:59.474 --> 00:35:01.142
<i>Maybe this is gonna sound stupid...</i>

00:35:01.309 --> 00:35:04.729
...and, believe me, it's not like
I was expecting, you know, fireworks...

00:35:04.896 --> 00:35:07.440
...or a string quartet or anything...

00:35:08.357 --> 00:35:11.027
...but I always thought pretending
to lose my virginity...

00:35:11.194 --> 00:35:12.945
...would be a little more...

00:35:13.112 --> 00:35:15.239
...I don't know, special?

00:35:16.324 --> 00:35:19.035
Judy Blume should've
prepared me for that.

00:35:26.667 --> 00:35:28.127
That is so beautiful.

00:35:28.294 --> 00:35:29.754
Never had one lesson.

00:35:29.921 --> 00:35:32.381
That boy from yesterday
just dropped this off for you.

00:35:32.548 --> 00:35:36.803
Well, put it in the pile of gifts
from my other suitors.

00:35:36.969 --> 00:35:39.764
- Thanks.
- He seems like a nice kid.

00:35:39.931 --> 00:35:41.974
He seemed a little incredibly gay.

00:35:42.141 --> 00:35:44.602
A dyed-in-the-wool homosexual,
that boy is.

00:35:44.769 --> 00:35:48.022
I just want you to know
your father and I are totally supportive.

00:35:48.189 --> 00:35:50.566
We love you no matter
what the sexual orientation...

00:35:50.733 --> 00:35:52.443
...of your opposite-sex sex partner.

00:35:52.610 --> 00:35:53.861
We're not dating, Mom.

00:35:54.028 --> 00:35:56.823
And don't worry about
not making us grandparents...

00:35:56.989 --> 00:35:59.909
...although we were kind of hoping
you'd get knocked up...

00:36:00.076 --> 00:36:02.453
...so we'd have a second shot
at raising kids.

00:36:02.620 --> 00:36:04.831
Really do it right this time.

00:36:04.997 --> 00:36:08.167
- Bye now.
- I dated a homosexual once.

00:36:08.334 --> 00:36:11.546
For a long time, actually.
A long time.

00:36:11.712 --> 00:36:15.424
Dear God, dear Lord, tell me you did
not marry and have children with him.

00:36:15.591 --> 00:36:17.134
No.

00:36:17.301 --> 00:36:18.344
No, no, no.

00:36:18.511 --> 00:36:20.555
Your father is as straight
as they come.

00:36:20.721 --> 00:36:23.057
A little too straight,
if you know what I mean.

00:36:23.224 --> 00:36:25.726
I don't. Can you shut the door, please?

00:36:28.855 --> 00:36:31.440
Okay, door's right over there.
Keep going.

00:36:31.607 --> 00:36:35.987
- Take it down.
- Go take that out to Dad. Nice.

00:36:42.618 --> 00:36:46.747
"Just in case you don't shop at Target.
Then you can go screw yourself.

00:36:46.914 --> 00:36:48.499
Brandon."

00:36:56.591 --> 00:36:57.633
Hi, Rhi.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.053
Is it true you got with Brandon
at Melody Dipshit's party?

00:37:01.804 --> 00:37:03.639
Is that what people
are saying happened?

00:37:03.806 --> 00:37:06.767
<i>That's what everyone
is saying happened.</i>

00:37:06.934 --> 00:37:09.812
Well, then I guess that...
I guess that's true.

00:37:09.979 --> 00:37:12.899
Just because you lost your virginity
doesn't mean you can go...

00:37:13.065 --> 00:37:16.777
- ...throwing your cat at everybody.
- I'm not throwing my cat at everybody.

00:37:16.944 --> 00:37:19.947
I had to hear from Jackie Rudetsky.

00:37:20.114 --> 00:37:21.782
<i>Do you know
how embarrassing that is?</i>

00:37:21.949 --> 00:37:26.287
Finding out you slept with some
gay dude from Jackie Rudetsky?

00:37:26.454 --> 00:37:27.830
Must've been embarrassing.

00:37:27.997 --> 00:37:29.749
<i>Why didn't you tell me
you were going?</i>

00:37:29.916 --> 00:37:31.918
I would've come with
and held your hair.

00:37:32.084 --> 00:37:34.211
Are you really making this
about you right now?

00:37:34.378 --> 00:37:37.965
- You're starting to get a reputation.
- You're coming off as a little pious.

00:37:38.132 --> 00:37:39.842
You're pissing me off
more than usual.

00:37:40.009 --> 00:37:41.969
<i>I think it's a best friend's duty...</i>

00:37:42.136 --> 00:37:46.474
...to let her know that everyone, and
I do mean everyone, is calling her...

00:37:46.641 --> 00:37:48.225
...a dirty skank.

00:37:48.768 --> 00:37:52.146
Well, do you think I'm a dirty skank?

00:37:52.313 --> 00:37:55.232
You know, I didn't wanna believe it,
but I guess it's true.

00:37:55.399 --> 00:37:58.152
<i>That is your identifier.</i>

00:37:58.319 --> 00:38:00.738
And you're a jealous virgin.

00:38:00.905 --> 00:38:02.073
So....

00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:05.993
<i>People thought I was a dirty skank?</i>

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:09.330
<i>Fine, I'd be the dirtiest skank
they'd ever seen.</i>

00:38:31.686 --> 00:38:33.354
Shit.

00:38:38.192 --> 00:38:41.445
Is everything all right? It sounds like
you're having sex in here...

00:38:41.612 --> 00:38:45.199
...which can't be true, due to the fact
that you have a homosexual boyfriend.

00:38:45.366 --> 00:38:47.785
He's not my boyfriend.

00:38:47.952 --> 00:38:51.664
Hey, no judgement.
All God's children. It's fine.

00:38:51.831 --> 00:38:54.542
I was gay once for a while.

00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:57.878
No big deal. We all do it. It's okay.

00:38:58.045 --> 00:38:59.964
Dad, can you just
shut the door, please?

00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:01.215
You all right, buddy?

00:39:03.509 --> 00:39:05.052
Yeah.

00:39:06.053 --> 00:39:07.638
Give them hell.

00:39:52.933 --> 00:39:54.769
- Hey, Anson.
- Hey.

00:39:54.935 --> 00:40:00.441
I just realised the funniest thing.
My name is an anagram for "I love."

00:40:01.067 --> 00:40:03.444
What's a...? What's an anagram?

00:40:03.778 --> 00:40:04.904
Look it up, big boy.

00:40:06.113 --> 00:40:07.448
What's your problem?

00:40:07.615 --> 00:40:09.200
You wanna know
what my problem is?

00:40:09.366 --> 00:40:13.204
No. That was a rhetorical question.
I don't wanna know anything from you.

00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:15.372
We are not friends anymore.

00:40:15.539 --> 00:40:17.333
We are officially over.

00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:18.959
Oh, rats.

00:40:19.126 --> 00:40:23.339
I want my Juicy sweatshirt back. It was
too loose around your chest anyway.

00:40:23.506 --> 00:40:25.549
Burn.

00:40:25.925 --> 00:40:27.635
- Stop.
- What?

00:40:47.321 --> 00:40:48.989
What are you doing?

00:40:50.157 --> 00:40:51.784
Nothing.

00:40:55.454 --> 00:40:57.957
Don't forget, tomorrow's Earth Day.

00:40:58.666 --> 00:41:02.336
Guys, we have a problem:
Olive Penderghast.

00:41:02.503 --> 00:41:04.171
- We need to pray for her.
- Amen.

00:41:04.338 --> 00:41:06.924
But we also need to
get her the hell out of here.

00:41:07.091 --> 00:41:08.134
Amen.

00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:10.511
You heard what happened
at Melody Bostic's.

00:41:10.678 --> 00:41:13.556
- I was there. I heard the whole thing.
- That's not something...

00:41:13.722 --> 00:41:16.684
- ...you need to advertise, Kurt.
- Sorry. But I was.

00:41:16.851 --> 00:41:21.021
I tried to witness to her, but this girl
is defiant to any type of help.

00:41:21.188 --> 00:41:23.858
Anybody here think they can
talk to her, get her to see...

00:41:24.024 --> 00:41:26.068
...what she's doing is wrong?

00:41:28.696 --> 00:41:31.949
- It's okay.
- I'm sorry, you guys. This is so stupid.

00:41:32.116 --> 00:41:35.452
No, it's not, Marianne. It's real.

00:41:35.619 --> 00:41:36.704
- It's real.
- Yeah, it is.

00:41:36.871 --> 00:41:38.747
Jesus tells us to love everyone.

00:41:38.914 --> 00:41:43.502
I mean, even the whores and
the homosexuals, but it's just so hard.

00:41:43.669 --> 00:41:48.215
It's so hard because they keep
doing it over and over again.

00:41:49.592 --> 00:41:50.968
Make me a promise.

00:41:51.135 --> 00:41:53.721
Make God a promise,
right here and right now...

00:41:53.888 --> 00:41:56.849
...that we will remain
pure and chaste until marriage.

00:41:57.016 --> 00:41:58.058
We promise.

00:41:58.225 --> 00:42:01.562
Awesome, awesome, awesome.

00:42:01.729 --> 00:42:06.108
I love you guys. God loves you guys.
Now, let's change lives today.

00:42:06.275 --> 00:42:08.319
- Micah?
- Let's do it.

00:42:32.885 --> 00:42:35.054
<i>I didn't know what they
were so upset about.</i>

00:42:35.221 --> 00:42:38.098
<i>I put an A on my wardrobe
just like they asked.</i>

00:42:38.265 --> 00:42:41.602
<i>Maybe it was because I was wearing
clothes that were two sizes too small.</i>

00:42:41.769 --> 00:42:43.103
Hey, Olive!

00:42:45.314 --> 00:42:47.983
You left your glass slipper
at the party the other night.

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:51.403
Yeah, and I got pumpkin
all over my dress too.

00:42:52.404 --> 00:42:54.782
Nice. Solid joke.

00:42:54.949 --> 00:42:57.493
It sucks because we could've
revisited Melody's bedroom.

00:42:57.660 --> 00:42:59.745
Oh, my God,
that was Melody Bostic's house.

00:42:59.912 --> 00:43:02.623
- Yeah.
- I can't believe you remember that.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:06.293
Well, yeah, come on. Who doesn't
remember their first almost-kiss?

00:43:08.963 --> 00:43:10.422
Hey, Olive.

00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:12.299
Evan. Hey, what's rocking?

00:43:12.466 --> 00:43:13.968
Can I talk to you for a second?

00:43:14.134 --> 00:43:15.844
Yeah, what's up?

00:43:16.303 --> 00:43:18.847
Don't get mad, but Brandon told me
what you did for him.

00:43:19.014 --> 00:43:22.810
Oh, well, rest assured,
it was equally as thrilling for me.

00:43:22.977 --> 00:43:24.770
No, he told me the truth.

00:43:25.896 --> 00:43:28.023
I was just hoping
you could do the same for me?

00:43:28.524 --> 00:43:29.942
Goodbye, Evan.

00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:32.903
Wait, wait. I can pay you.

00:43:33.070 --> 00:43:35.864
I am about six seconds away
from slapping you so hard...

00:43:36.031 --> 00:43:39.076
- ...your teeth will bleed.
- Can you do it in front of everyone?

00:43:40.869 --> 00:43:43.372
I don't need your permission,
you know.

00:43:45.624 --> 00:43:46.834
What?

00:43:47.001 --> 00:43:49.628
I mean, at the rate you're going...

00:43:49.795 --> 00:43:51.964
...I don't see how people
won't believe it.

00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:54.550
- Are you threatening me?
- I'll give you 100 bucks.

00:43:54.717 --> 00:43:56.135
You are repugnant.

00:43:57.011 --> 00:43:58.387
That's the problem.

00:44:00.014 --> 00:44:01.015
Never mind.

00:44:02.182 --> 00:44:04.184
I'm sorry I asked.

00:44:10.983 --> 00:44:13.068
I knew it wouldn't work.

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:14.945
I'm just a fat piece of shit.

00:44:16.488 --> 00:44:18.449
When will high school end already?

00:44:24.038 --> 00:44:25.873
Shit.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:30.502
I want a $100 gift card deposited
into my locker by noon tomorrow.

00:44:30.669 --> 00:44:33.881
Preferably to the Gap, but I will
also take Amazon.com or OfficeMax.

00:44:34.048 --> 00:44:38.052
Actually, make it OfficeMax.
I have my eye on a label maker.

00:44:38.218 --> 00:44:40.846
We did not have sex, okay?

00:44:41.013 --> 00:44:44.058
I let you fondle my chest,
and it was a glorious moment for you...

00:44:44.224 --> 00:44:47.394
...unmatched by anything
you've experienced, including cake.

00:44:47.561 --> 00:44:48.604
Got it?

00:44:49.313 --> 00:44:51.732
Wait a minute.
A hundred bucks for second base?

00:44:51.899 --> 00:44:54.360
- Yeah.
- Doesn't that seem a little steep?

00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:58.238
Can we throw in, like, some
butt action or some pants rubbing?

00:44:58.405 --> 00:45:00.991
- What are you, 9?
- Whatever. Are you in?

00:45:03.035 --> 00:45:05.204
- Whatever.
- Deal, then.

00:45:05.996 --> 00:45:07.498
Thanks, Olive.

00:45:07.664 --> 00:45:09.291
You know, the sad thing is, Evan...

00:45:09.458 --> 00:45:13.921
...if you'd been a gentleman
and maybe asked me on a date...

00:45:14.088 --> 00:45:15.297
...I might've said yes.

00:45:15.464 --> 00:45:18.092
Really?
Do you wanna go out with me?

00:45:18.258 --> 00:45:19.802
Not now I don't, shit-dick.

00:45:23.430 --> 00:45:27.101
<i>It should come as no surprise that the
rumour I was soliciting sex for money...</i>

00:45:27.267 --> 00:45:29.520
<i>...spread around the school
faster than....</i>

00:45:29.686 --> 00:45:33.357
<i>Well, faster than the first rumour
about me spread.</i>

00:45:36.402 --> 00:45:38.237
Guys, come over here.

00:46:04.972 --> 00:46:07.141
She'll do stuff for money.
Around the world....

00:46:07.307 --> 00:46:10.477
<i>But for people who knew the truth,
I was open for business.</i>

00:46:10.644 --> 00:46:15.107
<i>And whether I liked it or not,
I had a lot of customers.</i>

00:46:16.316 --> 00:46:18.652
<i>Phil Lord gave me
100 bucks from Best Buy...</i>

00:46:18.819 --> 00:46:22.322
<i>...so he could tell people
we hooked up behind the library.</i>

00:46:22.489 --> 00:46:25.242
<i>I got $50 from T.J. Maxx
so that Eric Ling could say...</i>

00:46:25.409 --> 00:46:28.036
<i>...we got it on during Chemistry.</i>

00:46:28.370 --> 00:46:31.957
<i>Ninety dollars from Panda Express
so Ryan Dukes could tell people...</i>

00:46:32.124 --> 00:46:35.836
<i>...I showed him mine,
but he did not show me his.</i>

00:46:36.003 --> 00:46:38.297
<i>Chris Miller,
big spender that he is...</i>

00:46:38.464 --> 00:46:42.009
<i>...gave me $40 worth of movie passes
for my pretend cowbell.</i>

00:46:42.176 --> 00:46:44.470
<i>They had an expiration date
and were only good...</i>

00:46:44.636 --> 00:46:46.472
<i>...at the stupid foreign movie theatre.</i>

00:46:46.638 --> 00:46:52.644
Hi. One for
<i>Der Scharlachrote Buchstabe.</i>

00:46:52.811 --> 00:46:55.772
<i>But even that is better
than Sanjay Chandrasekhar.</i>

00:46:55.939 --> 00:47:00.068
Seriously? A coupon? Twenty percent
off to Bath & Body Works?

00:47:00.235 --> 00:47:03.405
Is that how much our imaginary tryst
meant to you?

00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.365
I fake rocked your world.

00:47:05.532 --> 00:47:08.035
- It's all I can afford.
- How's that my problem, amigo?

00:47:08.202 --> 00:47:11.205
<i>I knew he wasn't Latino,
but for some reason all these shady...</i>

00:47:11.371 --> 00:47:13.665
<i>...backdoor deals
had me talking like Carlito.</i>

00:47:14.041 --> 00:47:16.168
- Beat it, <i>ese.</i>
- Okay.

00:47:16.335 --> 00:47:18.295
<i>Whatever happened to chivalry?</i>

00:47:18.462 --> 00:47:21.381
Does it only exist in '80s movies?

00:47:21.548 --> 00:47:25.636
<i>I want John Cusack holding
a boombox outside my window.</i>

00:47:25.802 --> 00:47:28.430
<i>I wanna ride off on a lawn mower
with Patrick Dempsey.</i>

00:47:28.889 --> 00:47:32.684
<i>I want Jake from</i> Sixteen Candles
<i>waiting outside the church for me.</i>

00:47:32.851 --> 00:47:35.604
<i>I want Judd Nelson
thrusting his fist into the air...</i>

00:47:35.771 --> 00:47:37.231
<i>...because he knows he got me.</i>

00:47:37.397 --> 00:47:40.359
<i>Just once, I want my life
to be like an '80s movie.</i>

00:47:40.943 --> 00:47:43.737
<i>Preferably one with a really awesome
musical number...</i>

00:47:43.904 --> 00:47:45.948
<i>...for no apparent reason.</i>

00:47:46.490 --> 00:47:51.036
But, no. No.
John Hughes did not direct my life.

00:47:51.203 --> 00:47:53.997
So instead of all that...

00:47:54.164 --> 00:47:57.376
...I get to save 15 cents...

00:47:57.543 --> 00:48:00.379
...on a bottle of Juniper Breeze
Antibacterial Gel.

00:48:00.546 --> 00:48:04.841
So if you're still with me,
and I'm hoping that most of you are...

00:48:05.008 --> 00:48:07.761
...this brings us to part four.

00:48:09.263 --> 00:48:12.599
How I, Olive Penderghast,
went from assumed trollop...

00:48:12.766 --> 00:48:14.434
...to an actual home-wrecker.

00:48:16.770 --> 00:48:20.607
- You wanted to see me?
- I did. Why don't you come in here?

00:48:28.115 --> 00:48:29.157
What's going on?

00:48:29.950 --> 00:48:32.619
- I'm accessorizing.
- Really?

00:48:32.786 --> 00:48:36.331
I think you're taking your reading
assignment a little bit too seriously.

00:48:36.498 --> 00:48:39.876
Well, I was really hoping
to get an A. Get it?

00:48:42.921 --> 00:48:44.298
I'm hearing some rumours.

00:48:44.464 --> 00:48:47.676
Well, those are true. I am considering
becoming an existentialist.

00:48:47.843 --> 00:48:50.429
- You know what I'm talking about.
- Jeez.

00:48:50.596 --> 00:48:54.891
When did teachers become
privy to idle adolescent gossip?

00:48:55.058 --> 00:49:00.897
That would be when everyone
is putting everything up on Facebook.

00:49:01.064 --> 00:49:03.483
I don't know what
your generation's fascination is...

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:06.028
...with documenting
your every thought...

00:49:06.194 --> 00:49:09.406
...but I can assure you
they're not all diamonds.

00:49:09.573 --> 00:49:11.992
"Roman is having an okay day...

00:49:12.159 --> 00:49:16.330
...and bought a Coke Zero
at the gas station.

00:49:16.496 --> 00:49:17.914
Raise the roof."

00:49:18.081 --> 00:49:19.333
Who gives a rat's ass?

00:49:19.499 --> 00:49:21.835
He got a Coke Zero again?

00:49:22.002 --> 00:49:24.171
That Roman. Incorrigible.

00:49:24.338 --> 00:49:28.050
Listen, whatever this little act is about,
I just... I'm curious.

00:49:28.216 --> 00:49:31.136
I really think you should consider
giving me extra credit...

00:49:31.303 --> 00:49:32.596
...for going the extra mile.

00:49:32.763 --> 00:49:35.766
I'm really attempting to understand
this puritanical ostracism...

00:49:35.932 --> 00:49:38.977
- ...Hawthorne wrote about.
- You are one of the few that read it.

00:49:39.144 --> 00:49:41.813
If I read one more paper
from one of your classmates...

00:49:41.980 --> 00:49:46.610
...who talks about how hot she is in
the bathtub, her fake British accent...

00:49:46.777 --> 00:49:50.822
...or, is she still married to
Ashton Kutcher, I'm gonna kill myself.

00:49:50.989 --> 00:49:53.659
Why don't people just watch
the original movie like I did?

00:49:54.242 --> 00:49:55.661
I know you read the book.

00:49:56.703 --> 00:49:57.871
I did.

00:49:58.038 --> 00:50:01.458
Listen, I want to apologise for
sending you to the principal's office.

00:50:01.625 --> 00:50:04.127
Truthfully, and I'll deny it
if you say anything...

00:50:04.294 --> 00:50:07.047
...I wanted to be cheering
with the rest of the students.

00:50:07.214 --> 00:50:09.716
I don't know what it is about Nina.

00:50:10.008 --> 00:50:11.635
I hate her.

00:50:11.802 --> 00:50:12.844
I won't tell.

00:50:13.011 --> 00:50:14.429
- I'll deny it if you do.
- Okay.

00:50:14.596 --> 00:50:16.723
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

00:50:16.890 --> 00:50:18.517
Stay golden.

00:50:18.684 --> 00:50:22.229
- Hi, Mrs. Griffith.
- Hi, you. How are you?

00:50:22.396 --> 00:50:24.731
A is for "awesome."

00:50:24.898 --> 00:50:26.441
Yeah.

00:50:27.067 --> 00:50:28.777
I've never seen that girl before.

00:50:28.944 --> 00:50:30.821
That does not surprise me.

00:50:30.987 --> 00:50:33.907
But I'm the guidance counsellor.
I should know all the students.

00:50:34.074 --> 00:50:36.576
Especially the ones
who dress like prostitutes.

00:50:36.743 --> 00:50:39.454
- It's good to see you.
- Hey. How are you? Good.

00:50:40.247 --> 00:50:43.917
No, stop. We're at school.
There are rules.

00:50:44.084 --> 00:50:46.420
- Windows.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:50:46.712 --> 00:50:48.755
Do me a favour, though.
Just talk to her.

00:50:48.922 --> 00:50:50.716
I think she's going through a phase.

00:50:50.882 --> 00:50:53.427
That's not the girl
everyone's talking about, is it?

00:50:53.593 --> 00:50:54.594
It is.

00:50:54.761 --> 00:50:57.389
Oh, okay. Oh, this'll be good.
All right.

00:50:57.556 --> 00:51:00.016
That snotty, Jesus-freak
office aide I have...

00:51:00.183 --> 00:51:02.144
...has been bitching
about her incessantly.

00:51:02.310 --> 00:51:06.606
They're all lies, but she could use
somebody to talk to anyway.

00:51:06.773 --> 00:51:09.359
All right. Hey, what are you doing
for dinner tonight?

00:51:09.526 --> 00:51:11.069
- You won't be there?
- Sorry.

00:51:11.236 --> 00:51:14.281
I have an after-school session.
Kid brought a knife to school.

00:51:14.448 --> 00:51:15.741
Well, be careful, all right?

00:51:15.907 --> 00:51:18.368
It was a butter knife.
But you know what they say.

00:51:18.535 --> 00:51:20.495
You know, it's a gateway knife, so....

00:51:20.662 --> 00:51:22.164
- All right, bye.
- Yeah. Bye.

00:51:22.330 --> 00:51:25.083
I'm thinking about another gateway.
It's a....

00:51:27.919 --> 00:51:28.962
Making spaghetti.

00:51:29.129 --> 00:51:31.047
- That's great.
- With meat.

00:51:31.214 --> 00:51:32.549
Enjoy eating your meat.

00:51:32.716 --> 00:51:35.427
- And balls.
- Enjoy eating your balls.

00:51:45.312 --> 00:51:46.688
Sharpening your pencils?

00:51:48.190 --> 00:51:49.608
Getting them nice and sharp?

00:51:50.275 --> 00:51:54.571
Sharpening them up? Look at you.
Look at you. So sharp.

00:51:54.738 --> 00:51:57.032
Sharpening those pencils.
Sharp, sharp, sharp.

00:51:57.491 --> 00:52:00.327
- God, that's sharp. I...
- Hey, Olive. You ready to come in?

00:52:03.330 --> 00:52:04.372
Good job.

00:52:04.539 --> 00:52:07.125
Well, the reason I called you in
was just so we could...

00:52:07.292 --> 00:52:10.170
...sort of, you know, just chat
about what's going on.

00:52:10.337 --> 00:52:12.964
You know, there is concern
from a few faculty members.

00:52:13.131 --> 00:52:14.633
Your husband.

00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:17.302
Olive, you're attempting
to make a statement.

00:52:17.469 --> 00:52:20.680
I'm just a little confused
as to what exactly that is.

00:52:21.306 --> 00:52:22.349
Am I in trouble?

00:52:22.516 --> 00:52:24.976
Because, pursuant
to the student code of conduct...

00:52:25.143 --> 00:52:27.813
...my hemline has never been
higher than my fingertips.

00:52:27.979 --> 00:52:29.314
No, you're not in trouble.

00:52:29.481 --> 00:52:31.024
I wanted to make sure you knew...

00:52:31.191 --> 00:52:33.568
...if there's something
that you wanna talk about...

00:52:33.735 --> 00:52:35.529
...you know, you can trust me.

00:52:35.695 --> 00:52:39.658
If I open up to you, do you promise
this stays in confidence?

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:43.078
Yeah. I'm... See?
I'm the guidance counsellor.

00:52:43.245 --> 00:52:44.621
That's what I do.

00:52:45.038 --> 00:52:47.040
I mean, I have a reputation to uphold.

00:52:47.207 --> 00:52:48.375
Don't you, though?

00:52:50.877 --> 00:52:54.881
All right, listen, don't tell anyone
I'm doing this, please.

00:52:55.048 --> 00:52:56.174
Here you go.

00:52:56.341 --> 00:52:58.218
- Here you go.
- I really don't need those.

00:52:58.385 --> 00:53:01.763
Oh, you really do. Here you go.

00:53:01.930 --> 00:53:03.515
Here you go. Okay?

00:53:03.682 --> 00:53:07.435
I just don't want this thing you're
going through to define your life.

00:53:07.602 --> 00:53:09.312
Olive, do what you gotta do. Okay?

00:53:09.479 --> 00:53:13.984
Let your freak flag fly. Just make sure
you have an exit strategy.

00:53:14.734 --> 00:53:18.113
Listen, Mrs. Griffith, I really...
I don't need these.

00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:20.699
The pill is not 100 percent effective.

00:53:20.866 --> 00:53:22.659
Ask some of your friends' parents.

00:53:23.702 --> 00:53:25.412
Thank you for coming in.

00:53:28.748 --> 00:53:32.002
Can you just send in the next person?
Thank you.

00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:37.257
You're up, hoss.

00:53:37.799 --> 00:53:40.343
Okay. Go. It's all right.

00:53:42.596 --> 00:53:44.890
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:53:51.354 --> 00:53:54.900
Don't you think it's a little strange
that your boyfriend is 22 years old...

00:53:55.066 --> 00:53:58.194
- ...and still in high school?
- Not that it's any of your business...

00:53:58.361 --> 00:53:59.738
...but he is here by choice.

00:53:59.905 --> 00:54:03.867
It's his choice he's a fourth-year senior
that can't pass any test he takes?

00:54:04.034 --> 00:54:06.369
His choice. His? His?

00:54:06.536 --> 00:54:07.579
Capital H?

00:54:07.746 --> 00:54:11.249
If God wanted him to graduate, God
would've given him the right answers.

00:54:14.628 --> 00:54:17.172
I'm sorry.
You gotta be shitting me, woman.

00:54:17.631 --> 00:54:20.091
Okay. So why was he blubbering
like a baby?

00:54:21.176 --> 00:54:24.763
- Is he struggling with his sexuality?
- No, you insensitive rhymes-with-witch.

00:54:24.930 --> 00:54:28.058
His parents are
going through a divorce.

00:54:31.478 --> 00:54:33.271
Okay.

00:54:40.070 --> 00:54:44.824
You know,
sometimes our boyfriend's parents...

00:54:44.991 --> 00:54:46.451
...they get divorced, you know?

00:54:46.618 --> 00:54:50.580
And it's important to remember
it's not your fault.

00:54:50.747 --> 00:54:51.790
So I gotta go.

00:54:53.166 --> 00:54:57.712
But they go to our church.
What will people say?

00:55:02.008 --> 00:55:06.346
How long do these embraces usually
last? Because I gotta go, but I...

00:55:06.513 --> 00:55:09.182
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes, I'm gonna be okay.

00:55:09.349 --> 00:55:11.059
Mrs. Griffith is amazing...

00:55:11.226 --> 00:55:14.980
...and she's gonna help Micah,
and everything's gonna be okay.

00:55:16.106 --> 00:55:19.818
See? All right, that's the spirit.
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:55:19.985 --> 00:55:21.653
Okay.

00:55:26.074 --> 00:55:28.994
Wait. Why are you even
being so nice to me?

00:55:31.079 --> 00:55:32.998
I did it.

00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.125
I got through to you.

00:55:38.211 --> 00:55:41.131
I'm so sorry about everything I said.
I am so, so sorry.

00:55:41.297 --> 00:55:45.510
I mean, I really want us to be friends.
Can we please be friends?

00:55:46.344 --> 00:55:47.470
Absolutely.

00:55:50.640 --> 00:55:53.893
<i>And for a day,
we were actually really good friends.</i>

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.980
<i>I was kind of starting to think
things were gonna turn around.</i>

00:55:57.147 --> 00:55:58.940
Olive!

00:55:59.107 --> 00:56:01.526
- Friend.
- Hey, friend.

00:56:01.693 --> 00:56:03.403
- I missed you.
- Oh, I missed you more.

00:56:03.570 --> 00:56:06.740
<i>She texted me in first period.</i>

00:56:14.122 --> 00:56:16.833
<i>By second period,
we apparently had private jokes.</i>

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.210
Olive. Olive.

00:56:22.881 --> 00:56:25.133
<i>Tragedy struck in Wood Shop.</i>

00:56:25.300 --> 00:56:27.427
<i>It wasn't because
someone sawed off a thumb...</i>

00:56:27.594 --> 00:56:29.095
<i>...which has happened.</i>

00:56:29.262 --> 00:56:32.140
Micah is in the hospital.
He is in so much pain.

00:56:32.307 --> 00:56:35.435
The nurse didn't know
what was wrong.

00:56:36.102 --> 00:56:38.104
There, there.

00:56:45.236 --> 00:56:47.489
It hurts so bad, Mommy.

00:56:47.655 --> 00:56:50.241
Well, it's just what I thought.
Chlamydia.

00:56:50.533 --> 00:56:51.868
No.

00:56:52.035 --> 00:56:55.622
Who have you been screwing?
Tell me.

00:56:55.789 --> 00:56:59.793
Tell me now
or I will kill you right here.

00:57:00.168 --> 00:57:03.296
Olive. Olive Penderghast!

00:57:06.591 --> 00:57:09.219
Olive. Olive Penderghast.

00:57:09.385 --> 00:57:11.721
I have to call you back.
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:57:11.888 --> 00:57:14.099
Goddamn it.

00:57:16.434 --> 00:57:18.561
Chlamydia?!

00:57:20.814 --> 00:57:22.774
That bitch!

00:57:24.984 --> 00:57:26.569
- Olive?
- Hey.

00:57:28.655 --> 00:57:32.450
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Goddamn it.

00:57:34.536 --> 00:57:35.662
<i>I panicked.</i>

00:57:35.829 --> 00:57:38.748
I said I got it
from Olive Penderghast.

00:57:38.915 --> 00:57:42.043
I know, but what was
I supposed to say?

00:57:42.210 --> 00:57:44.879
You know, and then my mom
tells Marianne's mom.

00:57:45.046 --> 00:57:47.715
I did. I tried to blame it
on their divorce...

00:57:47.882 --> 00:57:50.969
...but my mom is not buying it.

00:57:51.511 --> 00:57:53.847
That's it. I have to tell them.

00:57:54.013 --> 00:57:58.017
No, I do not care that you
gave me chlamydia. I don't!

00:57:58.226 --> 00:58:02.730
I love you and I want to be with you,
and nobody can stop us.

00:58:02.897 --> 00:58:06.776
<i>Not my mother, not Marianne,
and not even the school board...</i>

00:58:06.943 --> 00:58:09.279
...or the president of the Americas!

00:58:10.196 --> 00:58:11.948
Oh, God.

00:58:12.157 --> 00:58:13.867
Oh, God.

00:58:18.872 --> 00:58:21.457
What? What do you want?
What do you want?

00:58:21.624 --> 00:58:23.209
Just go.

00:58:26.462 --> 00:58:28.506
Perfect. Just perfect.

00:58:29.382 --> 00:58:32.302
I'm sorry, I just...
I was looking for Marianne.

00:58:32.468 --> 00:58:34.429
Did she say anything
about being mad at me?

00:58:34.596 --> 00:58:36.389
She just smacked
the bejesus out of me.

00:58:36.556 --> 00:58:39.434
No, that's my fault.
I'm so sorry, Olive. I'm sorry.

00:58:39.601 --> 00:58:43.479
But I messed up, okay?
I just goddamn shit...

00:58:43.646 --> 00:58:48.151
...goddamn messed up
really goddamn shit bad.

00:58:48.318 --> 00:58:50.236
Goddamn. Shit, goddamn.

00:58:50.403 --> 00:58:54.532
Okay. Don't get me wrong
because I love it...

00:58:54.699 --> 00:58:58.411
...but I don't think you're supposed to
use that language in front of a student.

00:58:58.578 --> 00:59:01.581
You know what else you're not
supposed to do, is sleep with them.

00:59:01.748 --> 00:59:04.000
But that didn't stop me. Goddamn shit.

00:59:04.751 --> 00:59:07.503
Wait. You... Oh, my God.

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:11.090
But I'm not... I'm not judging
you or anything, but, oh, my God.

00:59:11.257 --> 00:59:15.178
I... Wait, what does that
have to do with me?

00:59:15.345 --> 00:59:17.430
You should know
that my marriage is not great.

00:59:17.597 --> 00:59:19.265
We haven't slept together
in months.

00:59:19.432 --> 00:59:20.475
In months, all right?

00:59:20.642 --> 00:59:24.687
Finally, this great-looking guy comes
in and he's nice to me, you know?

00:59:24.854 --> 00:59:26.064
And he's not a minor.

00:59:26.231 --> 00:59:30.443
This is legal. It's legal
because he's been here forever, okay?

00:59:30.610 --> 00:59:33.404
He's not the sharpest
Christian in the Bible, all right?

00:59:33.571 --> 00:59:36.783
And then he finds out
that he has chlamydia.

00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:39.911
And so then he's telling
everybody that it was you.

00:59:40.078 --> 00:59:41.788
He didn't want me
to lose my job...

00:59:41.955 --> 00:59:45.375
...and he doesn't wanna get in trouble
either, so he said it's you.

00:59:45.541 --> 00:59:46.751
I'm sorry.

00:59:47.961 --> 00:59:50.922
But I'll... I'm gonna fix it, Olive.
Okay? I'll tell everyone.

00:59:51.089 --> 00:59:55.969
I'm gonna tell everyone that it's me.
Okay? I'll just... I'll lose my job.

00:59:56.469 --> 00:59:59.806
And, you know, whatever else I lose,
and then that's okay.

01:00:03.476 --> 01:00:06.562
<i>Maybe it was becoming a habit
of mine to help the downtrodden...</i>

01:00:06.729 --> 01:00:08.690
<i>...or maybe I just couldn't stand
to see...</i>

01:00:08.856 --> 01:00:10.775
<i>...my favourite teacher's
marriage crumble.</i>

01:00:10.942 --> 01:00:13.152
<i>Either way, I decided to help.</i>

01:00:13.653 --> 01:00:15.822
I could have chlamydia.

01:00:17.365 --> 01:00:21.452
I mean, I could have easily given it
to Micah.

01:00:21.619 --> 01:00:23.496
I mean, who knows?

01:00:23.663 --> 01:00:26.582
Women oftentimes
don't show symptoms.

01:00:26.749 --> 01:00:29.085
And the whole world knows
I've been whoring around.

01:00:29.252 --> 01:00:30.795
No, you haven't. No, you haven't.

01:00:30.962 --> 01:00:36.301
Because a real whore can't admit it
to herself, much less others. Trust me.

01:00:39.262 --> 01:00:40.596
Call Micah.

01:00:40.763 --> 01:00:44.142
Tell him he is an ass and
he owes me so big for this, but also...

01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:47.145
...tell him I confessed
to giving him chlamydia.

01:00:54.694 --> 01:00:57.196
Getting a lot of hugs today.

01:00:57.822 --> 01:01:00.325
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- Get out of here!

01:01:02.910 --> 01:01:05.204
<i>I guess I shouldn't be too shocked
these people...</i>

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:07.123
<i>...wanted my diseased ass
out of there.</i>

01:01:07.290 --> 01:01:08.333
Save yourself, Olive.

01:01:08.499 --> 01:01:11.336
<i>The funny thing is, the whole time
this all was going down...</i>

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:14.547
<i>...I couldn't help but think
I could've come up with better signs.</i>

01:01:14.714 --> 01:01:16.549
<i>Although you gotta love
the Quiznos guy.</i>

01:01:16.716 --> 01:01:19.886
<i>That's the one thing
that trumps religion: capitalism.</i>

01:01:20.053 --> 01:01:21.471
Why are you doing this?

01:01:21.637 --> 01:01:23.765
I'm trying to make this school
a better place.

01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:26.225
Start a petition to get rid
of the lead paint.

01:01:26.392 --> 01:01:27.727
New Honey Chicken at Quiznos.

01:01:27.894 --> 01:01:30.146
- Not now, Quiznos.
- You're a slut.

01:01:30.313 --> 01:01:31.481
You're going down, Olive.

01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:34.984
If this is because I'm more popular
than you, then I think what you're...

01:01:35.151 --> 01:01:37.653
Let's not mistake popularity
for infamy.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:40.698
- You don't wanna burn, do you?
- I'll be praying for you.

01:01:45.745 --> 01:01:47.455
Sorry.

01:01:48.081 --> 01:01:51.584
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm awesome. I'm awesome.

01:01:51.751 --> 01:01:53.252
Screw all these people, Olive.

01:01:53.419 --> 01:01:55.588
Haven't you heard?

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:57.924
I already did.

01:01:58.091 --> 01:02:01.094
- You're going to hell, Olive!
- What you're doing is wrong.

01:02:01.427 --> 01:02:03.429
You're going to hell!

01:02:08.267 --> 01:02:10.436
<i>So they got Rhiannon.</i>

01:02:10.603 --> 01:02:13.856
<i>Never underestimate the power
of extremists like Marianne.</i>

01:02:14.023 --> 01:02:17.777
<i>They sense any weakness,
they pounce like jungle cats.</i>

01:02:17.944 --> 01:02:20.696
<i>And the whack pack
just gets bigger and bigger.</i>

01:02:20.863 --> 01:02:22.949
<i>But at least they have a pack.</i>

01:02:23.116 --> 01:02:26.994
<i>I was used to being by myself,
but I had never felt more alone.</i>

01:02:27.161 --> 01:02:30.623
<i>I thought I should look into what they
were running around thumping about.</i>

01:02:30.790 --> 01:02:33.084
- Do you have a religion section?
- It's over there.

01:02:33.251 --> 01:02:35.253
- Can I help you with something?
- The Bible.

01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:38.381
That's in bestsellers,
right next to <i>Twilight.</i>

01:02:40.133 --> 01:02:42.343
<i>I didn't have time
to read the whole thing...</i>

01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.053
<i>...because it's, like, 600 pages.</i>

01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.721
<i>Single-spaced.</i>

01:02:45.888 --> 01:02:48.474
<i>And as every war
that's ever been fought can tell you...</i>

01:02:48.641 --> 01:02:50.643
<i>...there are many ways
you can interpret it.</i>

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:53.771
<i>Except the Civil War.
That was pure racism.</i>

01:02:53.938 --> 01:02:55.273
<i>So I went to find an expert.</i>

01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:59.819
<i>But really, I just kind of
wanted someone to talk to.</i>

01:03:01.154 --> 01:03:04.824
Forgive me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:03:05.324 --> 01:03:07.243
I think that's how you
start these things.

01:03:07.410 --> 01:03:09.662
I'm just going off
what I've seen in movies.

01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:11.873
Where do I even start?

01:03:13.082 --> 01:03:16.294
I've been pretending to be....

01:03:16.461 --> 01:03:18.337
What is the Catholic way
of phrasing this?

01:03:18.504 --> 01:03:20.339
A harlot?

01:03:21.507 --> 01:03:25.178
A harlot. It's not that
I've actually been doing...

01:03:25.344 --> 01:03:29.015
...the things that people have
been saying I've been doing...

01:03:29.182 --> 01:03:31.309
...but then again,
I'm not denying them either.

01:03:31.476 --> 01:03:34.896
So I was just wondering,
is that wrong?

01:03:35.521 --> 01:03:40.026
It's just that a lot of people
have been asking me to do things...

01:03:40.193 --> 01:03:46.365
...and I thought it was okay
because it wasn't real, you know?

01:03:48.117 --> 01:03:50.286
It was make-believe.

01:03:50.453 --> 01:03:52.872
And no one was getting hurt...

01:03:56.667 --> 01:03:59.754
...but a lot of people hate me now.

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:05.760
I kind of hate me too.

01:04:11.724 --> 01:04:13.935
I might be wrong...

01:04:14.727 --> 01:04:16.729
...but aren't you
supposed to say something?

01:04:16.896 --> 01:04:18.940
Tell me to say 10 Hail Marys,
pay a fine...

01:04:19.106 --> 01:04:21.609
...advance token to nearest railroad?
Hello?

01:04:23.903 --> 01:04:25.404
<i>Should've seen that one coming.</i>

01:04:32.328 --> 01:04:35.706
<i>Luckily, I live in a town
with many different places of worship.</i>

01:04:35.873 --> 01:04:38.417
<i>So I went to find one
with a real live human being.</i>

01:04:38.834 --> 01:04:39.877
Can I help you?

01:04:40.044 --> 01:04:42.672
Yeah, I was just wondering
if there's a minister around.

01:04:43.339 --> 01:04:45.299
Is it not a minister?

01:04:45.466 --> 01:04:47.510
A Reverend? A wizard?

01:04:47.677 --> 01:04:49.554
It's a pastor, and he's here.

01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:52.598
How can I help you today?

01:04:52.765 --> 01:04:56.102
I was wondering what your church's
stance on lying and adultery was.

01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:57.270
It's not a good thing.

01:04:57.436 --> 01:05:01.774
Oh, I agree, wholeheartedly.
But, then... Now, tell me this.

01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:03.359
Assuming there is a hell....

01:05:03.526 --> 01:05:06.654
Oh, the Christian Church recognizes
the existence of hell.

01:05:06.821 --> 01:05:09.115
Okay, so we'll just say
there's a "hell."

01:05:09.282 --> 01:05:11.409
There is. Just so we're clear.

01:05:11.576 --> 01:05:15.079
- Okay. So for argument's sake...
- No, there's no argument. It's there.

01:05:15.246 --> 01:05:18.833
Right below our feet,
right above the Orient. It's there.

01:05:21.085 --> 01:05:24.755
Then what would be worse,
lying or adultery?

01:05:24.922 --> 01:05:27.633
Or is lying about adultery
just like double whammy? Sorry.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:29.302
Come on.

01:05:32.221 --> 01:05:34.140
I'm sorry,
what did you say your name was?

01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:38.311
I didn't. I... You know what?
I'm just gonna...

01:05:38.477 --> 01:05:40.813
I'm just gonna go check out
Judaism because...

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:42.982
- God. Two frames, really?
- Sorry.

01:05:43.149 --> 01:05:45.276
The Jews and I have a lot in common.

01:05:45.443 --> 01:05:48.195
- Just fashion-wise and stuff.
- Off you go.

01:05:48.362 --> 01:05:51.407
<i>Yes, I had unwittingly sought advice
from the father...</i>

01:05:51.574 --> 01:05:53.659
<i>...of the leader of my lynch mob.</i>

01:05:53.826 --> 01:05:58.956
<i>What other complete and total idiot
can say that's happened to them?</i>

01:06:01.792 --> 01:06:05.254
Okay, I've narrowed it down
to <i>The Other Boleyn Girl...</i>

01:06:05.421 --> 01:06:08.090
...or <i>The Bucket List.</i> Huge hit.

01:06:08.257 --> 01:06:11.177
Why can't we watch a movie for kids?
You always get to pick.

01:06:11.344 --> 01:06:15.014
Because the Family Member
of the Week gets to pick the movie.

01:06:15.181 --> 01:06:17.767
Yeah, but you get Family Member
of the Week every week.

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:19.435
And there's a reason for that.

01:06:19.602 --> 01:06:22.271
Yeah. You pick
Family Member of the Week.

01:06:22.438 --> 01:06:23.939
Are you accusing me of nepotism?

01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:27.652
Okay, it's <i>The Bucket List.</i>
This is it. This is the greatest decision.

01:06:27.818 --> 01:06:30.946
I'm so happy with this decision.
That's what it's going to be.

01:06:31.113 --> 01:06:34.075
All right, now, honey, after we watch
<i>The Bucket List...</i>

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:38.788
...remember to cross "Watch
<i>The Bucket List"</i> off our bucket list.

01:06:38.954 --> 01:06:39.997
Guys.

01:06:40.164 --> 01:06:45.294
I want you to know that if you hear
I have chlamydia, that is totally false.

01:06:45.461 --> 01:06:47.963
Olive, do we need
to have the talk again?

01:06:48.130 --> 01:06:50.508
No. It's just a thing
that's going around.

01:06:50.675 --> 01:06:53.552
You know, nothing you're saying
is making me feel any better.

01:06:53.719 --> 01:06:56.389
Not to mention how you've been
dressing the last few days.

01:06:56.555 --> 01:06:58.432
No judgement,
but you look like a stripper.

01:06:58.599 --> 01:07:01.060
- Mom.
- A high-end stripper.

01:07:01.227 --> 01:07:02.853
For governors or athletes.

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:04.355
But stripper, nonetheless.

01:07:04.522 --> 01:07:07.191
Oh, my God.
I'm just trying to mix it up a little.

01:07:07.358 --> 01:07:09.151
And I have no STDs, I promise you.

01:07:09.318 --> 01:07:11.779
Oh, that's great.
Daughter of the Year.

01:07:11.946 --> 01:07:13.739
If you hear anything
to the contrary...

01:07:13.906 --> 01:07:16.117
...come up with some funny retort
and walk away.

01:07:16.283 --> 01:07:19.078
Honey, you're kind of
starting to worry us a little.

01:07:19.245 --> 01:07:21.247
Should we be kind of
worried a little?

01:07:21.414 --> 01:07:23.249
I don't think so.

01:07:23.416 --> 01:07:26.377
- You sure?
- Yeah.

01:07:26.627 --> 01:07:29.422
Yeah. I got it all under control.

01:07:30.631 --> 01:07:31.674
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:07:31.841 --> 01:07:34.009
Then let's <i>Bucket List</i> this bitch.

01:07:34.176 --> 01:07:36.011
<i>The Bucket List, The Bucket List.</i>

01:07:36.178 --> 01:07:38.556
To say this whole thing
had taken over my life...

01:07:38.723 --> 01:07:41.183
...would be
a colossal understatement.

01:07:41.392 --> 01:07:44.603
<i>I actually reread</i> The Scarlet Letter
<i>to see how Hester dealt with it.</i>

01:07:44.770 --> 01:07:49.608
<i>And it turns out she bore
her punishment in humble silence...</i>

01:07:49.775 --> 01:07:52.945
...which are two concepts
I am not comfortable with.

01:07:53.112 --> 01:07:55.322
<i>With all the mythical play
I was getting...</i>

01:07:55.489 --> 01:07:58.492
<i>...I still actually hadn't been
asked out on a real date.</i>

01:07:58.659 --> 01:08:01.746
<i>People were jumping up and down
to say they'd slept with me...</i>

01:08:01.912 --> 01:08:04.373
<i>...but no one bothered
really trying to sleep with me.</i>

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:07.460
<i>I was starting to think I actually did
have a gnome down there.</i>

01:08:07.626 --> 01:08:10.004
<i>- Until finally....</i>
- Hey, Olive.

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:12.381
Hey, Anson. What's up?

01:08:12.548 --> 01:08:14.675
I was wondering
if you were busy tonight.

01:08:14.842 --> 01:08:17.762
Maybe wanna go out or something?

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:20.389
What did you have in mind?

01:08:20.556 --> 01:08:23.267
I was thinking about getting
a hot-air balloon, you know...

01:08:23.434 --> 01:08:25.144
...bringing along some champagne...

01:08:25.311 --> 01:08:28.647
...and then possibly reading
some Sylvia Plath.

01:08:28.814 --> 01:08:32.193
Or we could just go
to The Lobster Shack...

01:08:32.359 --> 01:08:34.403
...because it's, you know,
a little easier.

01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:37.698
- I love The Lobster Shack.
- Good.

01:08:37.865 --> 01:08:39.325
Okay. It's a date, then.

01:08:40.493 --> 01:08:43.078
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:08:44.789 --> 01:08:47.541
So should I still bring
the Sylvia Plath or...?

01:08:47.708 --> 01:08:49.668
No, we could stick our heads
in the oven...

01:08:49.835 --> 01:08:51.921
...if we run out of things
to talk about.

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:53.672
That was....

01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:55.800
- Cool. All right. Well....
- Cool.

01:09:04.683 --> 01:09:05.976
You look really beautiful.

01:09:06.143 --> 01:09:07.853
Thank you.

01:09:10.022 --> 01:09:11.732
- You're a real gentleman.
- No.

01:09:11.899 --> 01:09:16.403
Just a guy having dinner with a girl.

01:09:27.665 --> 01:09:31.210
Do you believe this whole thing
about lobster being an aphrodisiac?

01:09:31.377 --> 01:09:33.879
I did not know it was.

01:09:34.046 --> 01:09:36.507
Medical science really
has not substantiated claims...

01:09:36.674 --> 01:09:39.885
...that any particular food increases
sexual desire or performance...

01:09:40.052 --> 01:09:42.888
...but guys just spend and spend
to ply women with food...

01:09:43.055 --> 01:09:46.559
...they think is gonna get them lucky.
Which is funny, because, it's like...

01:09:46.725 --> 01:09:49.812
...what is sexy about
slurping back oysters? Nothing.

01:09:49.979 --> 01:09:53.566
Did you know some people actually
eat ground-up rhinoceros horn...

01:09:53.732 --> 01:09:56.777
...because it's thought to increase
the size of the male sex organ?

01:09:56.944 --> 01:09:58.904
That's not true at all.

01:09:59.071 --> 01:10:01.699
Spanish fly. Spanish fly.
You've heard of this? Yes?

01:10:01.866 --> 01:10:03.409
- Yes.
- Okay. That thing?

01:10:03.576 --> 01:10:05.703
Pulverized blister beetle. What?

01:10:05.870 --> 01:10:09.415
And it's illegal in the U.S. because
if you eat just a little bit too much...

01:10:09.582 --> 01:10:12.751
...it causes painful urination,
fever and bloody discharge.

01:10:12.918 --> 01:10:14.295
- Am I talking too much?
- No.

01:10:14.461 --> 01:10:17.172
You're just burning through
a lot of topics really fast.

01:10:17.339 --> 01:10:20.175
Shouldn't have had coffee
three weeks ago.

01:10:20.342 --> 01:10:21.385
I'm just kidding.

01:10:21.552 --> 01:10:25.389
Your Maine lobster
with crab and seafood stuffing.

01:10:26.765 --> 01:10:28.684
- I'm jealous.
- Thank you.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:31.729
Let's dig in. Right?

01:10:35.858 --> 01:10:38.319
I didn't know Woodchuck Todd
worked here.

01:10:45.868 --> 01:10:47.161
He's dressed like a lobster.

01:10:47.328 --> 01:10:50.247
I should start calling him
Lobster Todd.

01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:57.129
Shit.

01:10:57.296 --> 01:10:59.089
- Shit, shit, shit.
- What? What's wrong?

01:10:59.256 --> 01:11:00.758
- Rhiannon's over there.
- So?

01:11:00.925 --> 01:11:03.177
She's been in love with you
since 1st grade.

01:11:03.344 --> 01:11:05.888
- She's my best friend.
- I thought you weren't speaking.

01:11:06.055 --> 01:11:08.390
But that doesn't mean
she's not my best friend.

01:11:08.557 --> 01:11:10.100
Or that I should be out with you.

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:12.645
Rhi and I don't have
anything in common.

01:11:12.811 --> 01:11:14.563
- And you and I do?
- Yeah.

01:11:14.730 --> 01:11:17.816
- Like what?
- Like I hate Marianne Bryant too.

01:11:17.983 --> 01:11:20.819
If that's our connection,
I should date the entire school.

01:11:20.986 --> 01:11:22.738
Haven't you?

01:11:23.948 --> 01:11:26.492
No. No, I haven't.

01:11:29.870 --> 01:11:31.580
Okay, she can't see us.
Check. Check.

01:11:31.747 --> 01:11:34.041
Can you just...? Excuse me? Hi.

01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:38.545
I just remembered
I am so allergic to shellfish.

01:11:38.712 --> 01:11:41.006
I forget that my respiratory system
will collapse.

01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:43.425
- I have a gift certificate. Keep the tip.
- Thanks.

01:11:43.592 --> 01:11:45.135
I'm sorry, but we have to go.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:48.055
- Go. Go. Come on. Come on.
- Okay.

01:11:48.222 --> 01:11:49.807
Go, go, go.

01:11:57.815 --> 01:11:59.858
I'm sorry about that.

01:12:02.152 --> 01:12:04.571
I've got something for you.

01:12:05.948 --> 01:12:08.200
Two hundred dollars
to The Home Depot.

01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:16.125
I didn't realise this was a...

01:12:16.291 --> 01:12:20.045
I know it sounds kind of lame, but they
really do have some awesome stuff.

01:12:20.212 --> 01:12:22.715
I bought my air compressor there.

01:12:24.216 --> 01:12:26.885
So, what did we do on this date?

01:12:27.052 --> 01:12:28.637
Whatever 200 bucks gets me.

01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:34.101
- That's not really how it works.
- It's okay.

01:12:34.893 --> 01:12:36.395
Stop.

01:12:36.562 --> 01:12:39.231
I'm not really having sex with people
for money.

01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:43.360
I'm saying I'm having sex for money,
but I'm not having sex for money.

01:12:43.527 --> 01:12:45.195
It's okay. It's all right. Come on.

01:12:45.362 --> 01:12:47.031
- Stop. No, no.
- What?

01:12:47.197 --> 01:12:48.449
Stop!

01:12:48.615 --> 01:12:51.201
Come on, just relax. Come on, babe.
It's all right.

01:12:51.368 --> 01:12:54.455
God. Asshole.

01:12:58.625 --> 01:13:01.879
What are you doing? I paid you.

01:13:02.796 --> 01:13:04.757
Now you didn't.

01:13:06.759 --> 01:13:09.762
Come on, this is bullshit.

01:13:14.099 --> 01:13:15.976
Goddamn it.

01:13:17.186 --> 01:13:18.937
Hey, Olive.

01:13:20.355 --> 01:13:22.232
Todd, hi.

01:13:27.613 --> 01:13:30.991
- Hey, you all right?
- I just have something in my eye.

01:13:31.158 --> 01:13:34.536
Like a twig, you know, or a branch,
or a contact, or something.

01:13:34.703 --> 01:13:38.957
- I didn't know you wore contacts.
- I don't, which is why I was tearing up.

01:13:39.708 --> 01:13:43.837
Olive, hey. Let me drive you home.

01:13:51.887 --> 01:13:54.640
Do you wanna talk about it?

01:13:58.143 --> 01:14:02.397
What's to say?
Everybody thinks I'm a whore...

01:14:03.190 --> 01:14:05.776
...and for the first time,
I'm starting to believe it.

01:14:05.943 --> 01:14:06.985
What?

01:14:07.152 --> 01:14:09.988
Don't act like you don't know
what people are saying about me.

01:14:10.155 --> 01:14:12.991
I know what people are saying.
Doesn't mean I believe them.

01:14:13.158 --> 01:14:14.993
- Who told you?
- No one.

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:18.413
No one had to tell me that once upon
a time, there was a scared kid...

01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:22.417
...at a party in a dark room
who was not ready for his first kiss.

01:14:22.584 --> 01:14:27.047
And, you know, there was
this amazing girl who lied for him.

01:14:27.214 --> 01:14:30.134
I still can't believe
you remember that.

01:14:33.387 --> 01:14:36.431
You know, sometimes I pretend
you were my first real kiss.

01:14:37.850 --> 01:14:39.518
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:43.355
- Who was?
- It was Rhiannon.

01:14:43.522 --> 01:14:45.232
- What?
- She must have told you.

01:14:45.399 --> 01:14:49.611
Yeah, it was... I think it was, like,
a year after that or something.

01:14:49.778 --> 01:14:52.614
It sucked, by the way.
She was, like:

01:14:52.781 --> 01:14:55.033
That bitch.

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:57.911
Oh, my God,
she knew how I felt about you.

01:14:58.078 --> 01:15:00.956
- How do you feel about me?
- And here I am feeling so bad.

01:15:01.123 --> 01:15:02.332
That's just perfect.

01:15:02.499 --> 01:15:04.877
Wait, hold on a second.
How do you feel about me?

01:15:05.085 --> 01:15:06.795
"Felt."

01:15:07.171 --> 01:15:08.547
I said "felt."

01:15:10.340 --> 01:15:13.635
Because I thought I...
I thought I heard "feel."

01:15:13.802 --> 01:15:15.429
- No, it was "felt."
- All right.

01:15:15.596 --> 01:15:17.639
How do you know where I live?

01:15:17.806 --> 01:15:19.141
We used to carpool.

01:15:19.641 --> 01:15:22.978
Yeah, in 2nd grade. What, are you
like a savant for people's addresses?

01:15:23.145 --> 01:15:25.230
Just for people who I think are cool.

01:15:25.898 --> 01:15:28.066
- You think I'm cool?
- I do.

01:15:28.233 --> 01:15:31.528
And I think you're pretty and smart.

01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:34.615
Did you form this opinion
prior to my little transformation?

01:15:34.781 --> 01:15:36.450
Way prior.

01:15:37.826 --> 01:15:39.661
Why didn't that rumour spread?

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.872
I like to keep my business to myself.

01:15:42.039 --> 01:15:44.041
Notoriety, for whatever reason...

01:15:44.208 --> 01:15:47.085
...never seems to benefit the noted,
it's only the "notees."

01:15:48.837 --> 01:15:50.422
Where were you two weeks ago?

01:15:55.344 --> 01:15:56.511
Olive.

01:15:57.721 --> 01:16:02.559
If I promise not to tell anyone,
could I kiss you right now?

01:16:06.271 --> 01:16:08.023
No.

01:16:10.067 --> 01:16:12.277
- Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.
- Oh, no.

01:16:12.444 --> 01:16:14.571
I just mean, not like this.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:17.616
I don't wanna kiss you with mascara
running down my face...

01:16:17.783 --> 01:16:20.285
...and some horndog guy
just having tried...

01:16:20.452 --> 01:16:23.497
...to stick his tongue
down my throat.

01:16:24.623 --> 01:16:27.084
I've wanted to kiss you
since 8th grade...

01:16:28.085 --> 01:16:30.420
...but I want it to be perfect.

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:34.091
And right now, my life is a mess.

01:16:34.508 --> 01:16:37.844
I need to get my business in order
before I drag you into it.

01:16:38.011 --> 01:16:40.305
What if I told you
I wanna be dragged into it?

01:16:41.265 --> 01:16:42.849
I could help, maybe.

01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:12.796
Why now?

01:17:13.964 --> 01:17:15.966
Why are you all of a sudden
into me now?

01:17:16.133 --> 01:17:17.259
I don't know.

01:17:17.718 --> 01:17:21.138
I haven't overanalyzed it,
like you're about to.

01:17:25.642 --> 01:17:29.229
- Good night, Olive.
- Good night, Lobster Todd.

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:34.609
<i>Now that I knew there were decent
and goodhearted people out there...</i>

01:17:34.776 --> 01:17:36.361
<i>...the lies had to stop.</i>

01:17:36.528 --> 01:17:40.032
<i>I knew there was only one person I
could count on to set the story straight:</i>

01:17:40.198 --> 01:17:41.199
<i>Brandon.</i>

01:17:41.366 --> 01:17:44.619
<i>I'd helped him, and even though
it would destroy his new reputation...</i>

01:17:44.786 --> 01:17:47.331
<i>...as a straight stud,
I knew he'd help me.</i>

01:17:47.497 --> 01:17:50.125
Oh, my God. Did you hear that
Brandon ran away from home?

01:17:50.292 --> 01:17:53.712
Yeah, totally. He left his parents
a note that said, "I'm gay, bitches"...

01:17:53.879 --> 01:17:57.049
...and then he skipped town
with some big, hulking black guy.

01:17:58.342 --> 01:17:59.843
My apologies to Mark Twain.

01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:01.094
- Wait, huh?
- What?

01:18:01.261 --> 01:18:03.221
- You said something.
- You said something.

01:18:03.388 --> 01:18:05.265
You said something,
so I came back.

01:18:05.432 --> 01:18:06.892
- You're funny. Okay.
- Call me.

01:18:07.059 --> 01:18:10.228
<i>I went to everyone I'd helped
and begged them to say it wasn't true.</i>

01:18:10.395 --> 01:18:12.564
No way. I gave you money.

01:18:12.731 --> 01:18:16.360
You gave me a gift card to AutoZone.
I don't even have a car.

01:18:16.526 --> 01:18:18.320
I thought it'd be aspirational.

01:18:18.487 --> 01:18:22.699
Evan, please do this for me, all right?
I did that for you. Do this for me.

01:18:22.866 --> 01:18:25.786
I don't want people to know
I didn't go to second base with you.

01:18:25.952 --> 01:18:28.955
Do you know how many girls
I've hooked up with because of that?

01:18:29.122 --> 01:18:30.665
Girls are almost as dumb as boys.

01:18:30.832 --> 01:18:33.543
Oh, yes, they are.

01:18:37.047 --> 01:18:38.423
<i>It gets worse.</i>

01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:40.217
"Honour your father
and your mother."

01:18:40.384 --> 01:18:43.804
<i>Due to his condition, Micah was sent
on a visit to his grandparents...</i>

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:45.430
<i>...in Palatka, Florida.</i>

01:18:45.597 --> 01:18:48.767
<i>And if there's one thing worse
than chlamydia, it's Florida.</i>

01:18:48.934 --> 01:18:50.727
"... be guilty of adultery."

01:18:50.894 --> 01:18:52.938
Get your hands
out of your berries, boy.

01:18:53.105 --> 01:18:55.107
<i>Olive, life is full of choices.</i>

01:18:55.273 --> 01:18:58.527
I made a bad one.
But then, so did you.

01:18:58.693 --> 01:19:02.030
But I see no other alternative
than to just live with the guilt.

01:19:02.197 --> 01:19:05.534
My guilt stems from my indiscretion
and yours for lying.

01:19:06.118 --> 01:19:09.830
We made our choices.
Now, we just have to let it ride.

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:14.292
Or I could just tell everyone the truth
and get you fired and put in jail.

01:19:14.459 --> 01:19:17.087
Okay, first of all, he is of age, okay?

01:19:17.254 --> 01:19:19.464
It's perfectly legal
in the state of California.

01:19:19.631 --> 01:19:22.217
I checked. He is 21 in eight months.

01:19:22.384 --> 01:19:25.303
And secondly, let's play the Who
Would You Believe game, okay?

01:19:25.470 --> 01:19:28.849
Why don't you ask yourself, if you
were an adult, who would you believe?

01:19:29.015 --> 01:19:31.101
Who would you believe?
Who would you believe?

01:19:31.268 --> 01:19:33.437
Who would you believe? Who?

01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:40.360
Thank you for coming in.

01:19:43.697 --> 01:19:48.076
<i>Yeah, Mrs. Griffith was pure evil, but
I still shouldn't have done what I did.</i>

01:19:48.243 --> 01:19:51.037
Your wife has chlamydia,
and she's sleeping with a student...

01:19:51.204 --> 01:19:53.832
...and she gave it to him,
and she's trying to blame me.

01:19:55.167 --> 01:19:56.710
What?

01:20:00.172 --> 01:20:01.923
I'm sorry.

01:20:04.759 --> 01:20:06.511
I'm sorry.

01:20:07.304 --> 01:20:09.764
Mr. Griffith, if you ever see this...

01:20:09.931 --> 01:20:15.854
...just know that I was wrong
to tell you that in that way. At all.

01:20:16.188 --> 01:20:18.064
I shouldn't have done it.

01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:21.193
<i>And I don't even feel bad
for lying for your wife.</i>

01:20:21.359 --> 01:20:26.865
<i>But I hate myself for telling you
the truth. I am so sorry.</i>

01:20:27.032 --> 01:20:31.161
<i>With my words, even though
they were true, I ended a marriage.</i>

01:20:31.369 --> 01:20:35.790
<i>Looking back, that's the thing
I regret the most.</i>

01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:47.636
So now everyone that knows the truth
is either gone or they won't fess up.

01:20:47.802 --> 01:20:52.807
And Marianne Bryant and her
disciples are demanding my head.

01:20:52.974 --> 01:20:56.561
The messed-up thing is I would not put
it past Principal Gibbons to expel me.

01:20:56.728 --> 01:20:58.897
I had a similar situation
when I was your age.

01:20:59.064 --> 01:21:00.732
What? Everyone called you a slut?

01:21:00.899 --> 01:21:03.985
I had a horrible reputation and
people said awful things about me.

01:21:04.486 --> 01:21:06.404
- Why?
- Because I was a slut.

01:21:06.571 --> 01:21:10.992
I slept with a whole bunch of people.
A slew, a heap, a peck. Mostly guys.

01:21:11.159 --> 01:21:13.453
- Mom.
- Sorry, I got around.

01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:16.623
Before I met Dad,
I had incredibly low self-worth.

01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:20.377
Do me a favour and just stuff this down
my throat until I asphyxiate to death.

01:21:20.544 --> 01:21:23.046
- It's true. It is.
- I want to die.

01:21:23.213 --> 01:21:25.549
It's true.
I was quite the contortionist.

01:21:25.715 --> 01:21:28.760
I could do this thing. I could go...
I mean, my leg all the way...

01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:31.221
Stop. Can you stop?
Don't show me.

01:21:31.388 --> 01:21:34.474
- Can you not see that I'm a mess?
- No, you're not, Olive.

01:21:34.641 --> 01:21:36.393
You're wonderful.

01:21:36.935 --> 01:21:39.104
And you'll handle this
the same way I did.

01:21:39.271 --> 01:21:41.731
With an incontrovertible
sense of humour.

01:21:43.024 --> 01:21:45.443
But you're much smarter than I am...

01:21:45.610 --> 01:21:48.697
...so you'll come out of this
much better than I did.

01:21:51.449 --> 01:21:52.617
Thank you, Mom.

01:21:53.952 --> 01:21:58.456
- I could get my leg so far back.
- No, no, no. Stop it.

01:21:58.623 --> 01:22:01.459
<i>So it was time to put an end
to all this once and for all...</i>

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:03.253
<i>...by telling my side of the story.</i>

01:22:03.420 --> 01:22:05.547
<i>And that's why I decided
to do this Webcast.</i>

01:22:05.714 --> 01:22:08.008
So here we go.

01:22:09.634 --> 01:22:11.303
Part five.

01:22:11.469 --> 01:22:13.597
Not with a fizzle, but with a bang.

01:22:13.763 --> 01:22:17.642
<i>Today we had yet another
one of our ridiculous pep rallies.</i>

01:22:17.809 --> 01:22:20.979
<i>Todd convinced the band to play
the sexiest song in their repertoire.</i>

01:22:21.146 --> 01:22:24.733
<i>I needed to pique everyone's interest
to get them to go home and log on.</i>

01:22:24.899 --> 01:22:28.278
<i>I had one outfit left and I figured
about 30 seconds to do it.</i>

01:22:28.445 --> 01:22:31.197
<i>Plus I really wanted
my own awesome musical number...</i>

01:22:31.823 --> 01:22:33.867
<i>...for no apparent reason.</i>

01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:39.831
Is that Olive?

01:24:04.416 --> 01:24:06.292
This was just a free preview.

01:24:06.459 --> 01:24:12.090
For the main event, log on to
www.FreeOlive.com tonight at 6 p.m.

01:24:12.257 --> 01:24:15.510
And I know it interferes with
the basketball game but, come on...

01:24:15.677 --> 01:24:17.762
...would you rather cheer on
the Woodchucks...

01:24:17.929 --> 01:24:20.140
...or watch me do one?

01:24:21.641 --> 01:24:24.894
What do you think you're doing?
Get to my office right now.

01:24:25.061 --> 01:24:28.690
I can't, because I have a date with the
guy I like and the rest of the school.

01:24:28.857 --> 01:24:32.068
I think before you expel me,
you might wanna talk to Mrs. Griffith...

01:24:32.235 --> 01:24:34.946
...because I think she might
talk you into letting me stay.

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:37.615
Go, Woodchucks!

01:24:47.584 --> 01:24:50.086
And here you all are...

01:24:50.253 --> 01:24:53.131
...waiting outside the bedroom door
for me to kiss Todd...

01:24:53.298 --> 01:24:55.842
<i>...listening to me pretend
to have sex with Brandon...</i>

01:24:56.009 --> 01:24:58.219
<i>...paying me to lie for you...</i>

01:24:58.386 --> 01:25:00.430
<i>...and calling me
every name in the book.</i>

01:25:00.638 --> 01:25:03.391
<i>You know, it was just like Hester
in</i> The Scarlet Letter.

01:25:03.558 --> 01:25:06.060
<i>Except that's the one thing
the movies don't tell you:</i>

01:25:06.227 --> 01:25:11.441
How shitty it feels to be an outcast.
Warranted or not.

01:25:20.784 --> 01:25:22.702
How did you know I love this song?

01:25:22.869 --> 01:25:24.162
I guessed.

01:25:24.329 --> 01:25:27.749
I see you've been watching my live
Webcast. It's still going on, you know.

01:25:27.916 --> 01:25:31.294
Screw them. They've had
enough of you. Figuratively speaking.

01:25:31.461 --> 01:25:34.464
I borrowed my neighbour's mower.
I came right over.

01:25:34.631 --> 01:25:35.673
That almost rhymed.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:38.384
I know. I spent a minute on it.

01:25:38.551 --> 01:25:40.553
I'll be right down.

01:25:42.222 --> 01:25:44.015
That's Todd.

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:49.145
Not that I owe you guys any more
confessions, but I really like this guy...

01:25:49.312 --> 01:25:53.566
<i>...and I might even lose my virginity
to him.</i>

01:25:54.234 --> 01:25:56.152
I don't know when it'll happen.

01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:59.364
You know, it might be five minutes
from now or tonight...

01:25:59.948 --> 01:26:03.451
...or six months from now
or maybe on our wedding night.

01:26:03.618 --> 01:26:08.498
But the really amazing thing is,
it is nobody's goddamn business.

01:26:10.875 --> 01:26:12.252
Come on, where's she going?

01:26:12.418 --> 01:26:14.629
I thought she was going
to take her clothes off.

01:26:14.796 --> 01:26:17.340
Demi Moore took her clothes off.
This is bullshit.

01:26:17.507 --> 01:26:20.969
Come on. Are you kidding me?

01:26:22.929 --> 01:26:25.682
- Piss off.
- Come here, you punk.

01:26:28.726 --> 01:26:30.228
Jack?

01:26:58.006 --> 01:27:00.425
<i>That's a mighty snug little shelter,
Huck.</i>

01:27:00.592 --> 01:27:02.051
<i>I judge it's all right.</i>

01:27:02.218 --> 01:27:04.262
<i>Here, Jim, I'll take my turn
at steering now.</i>

01:27:04.429 --> 01:27:06.806
<i>No, that's all right, Huck.
I like steering.</i>

01:27:49.766 --> 01:27:51.643
Blue Devils!
