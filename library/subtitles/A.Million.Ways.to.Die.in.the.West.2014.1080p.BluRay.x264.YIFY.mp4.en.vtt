<i>This was the American
frontier in 1882.</i>

00:03:17.113 --> 00:03:19.948
<i>A hard land for hard folk.</i>

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:26.163

struggle for survival.</i>

<i>Hell, this was Miss
America in 1880.</i>

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:31.960
<i>Holy shit.</i>

00:03:31.961 --> 00:03:35.964
<i>To build a home and a life in
this harsh, unforgiving country</i>

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:41.503
<i>required that a man be bold,
fearless, and tough as iron.</i>

<i>The men who were
courageous and resilient</i>

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:45.808

Surprised you showed up, Stark.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:04.410
Yeah, well, you said you
would kill my family

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:07.279
and burn my house down
if I didn't, so...

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:13.836
Is there anything at
all that I can say

00:04:13.837 --> 00:04:15.546
to get you to call this off?

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:17.756
You yellow, Stark?

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:21.719
Oh, okay, well, that's a little
racist to our hardworking friends

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.755
over here from the Far
East, right, guys?

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.890
Draw, you son of a bitch!

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:29.852
Look, I just feel like if we
can talk this out, you know,

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:32.396
we can find a calm,
rational solution

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:35.190
and maybe we even laugh
about it one day.

00:04:35.191 --> 00:04:37.943
I ain't in the mood
to laugh, Stark!

00:04:37.944 --> 00:04:39.945
Look, there's always
humor in any...

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:42.197
Oh, hey, look. This will make
you laugh. Look at our shadows.

00:04:42.198 --> 00:04:43.741
It looks like our shadows are
about to kiss each other.

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:44.825
Look at that.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:47.578
Oh, wait, watch this. Oh,
my God, Charlie. Oh, my God.

00:04:47.579 --> 00:04:49.496

so generous of you.

when it's right, it's right, huh?

00:04:54.836 --> 00:04:57.588
I'll give you a little tap on the
hat when I'm good to go, okay?

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:59.882
Look, we're laughing, right?
We're laughing now.

00:04:59.883 --> 00:05:01.216
What were we even fighting about?

00:05:01.217 --> 00:05:03.418

Your goddamn sheep grazed
up half my ranch, Stark.

00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.725
That grass ain't never
gonna grow back!

00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.393
All right, look. How about this?

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.395
I'll pay you the money
you lost, okay?

00:05:13.396 --> 00:05:15.189
Just give me two days to sell off

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.565
a few of my sheep and
I'll get you the money.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:17.816

I'm coming after ya.

much for your patience.

00:05:23.656 --> 00:05:25.324
I really appreciate it.

all these people

who came out here
hoping that we would

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.205
find an amicable
solution to this, huh?

Aw, somebody shoot some fucker!

00:05:33.375 --> 00:05:35.959
I took a half-day
off work for this!

Okay, I just want to point out

00:05:37.045 --> 00:05:39.838

have been the end of it, right?

I mean, I tell him
I'll pay him off,

we go our separate
ways, and that's it.

00:06:03.738 --> 00:06:05.906
But, no, he shoots me
in the fucking leg.

but come on, look at that.

00:06:16.876 --> 00:06:19.912
You should have fought him.

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:22.339
I should have fought him?

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.258
You're serious.

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:26.969
Louise! My God! The guy is one
of the best shots around.

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:29.763
- I look like I have Parkinson's next to him.
- What is that?

00:06:29.764 --> 00:06:33.559
It's just another way God
mysteriously shows that He loves us.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.561

suicide to fight that guy.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.528

Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.496
I got shot today.

00:06:54.497 --> 00:06:56.540
I know.

00:06:56.541 --> 00:06:57.958
Wait, wait, wait. Hang on a sec.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.626
Louise, where is this coming from?

00:06:59.627 --> 00:07:01.128
Is this because of the gunfight?

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:04.006
No, I've actually been feeling
this way for a while.

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:05.841
You're a great guy. I just...

00:07:05.842 --> 00:07:07.384
I realized that

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.386
I want something else.

Something else? Louise, it's
been a year and a half!

Look, I know I'm just a sheep
farmer, but I'm saving money...

00:07:14.059 --> 00:07:16.060
Yeah, but you're not even a
good sheep farmer, Albert.

00:07:16.061 --> 00:07:17.436
Your sheep are everywhere.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.188
The one thing a sheep
farmer has to do

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.106
is keep all of his sheep
in one place, all right.

00:07:21.107 --> 00:07:22.858
I went to your farm the other day,

00:07:22.859 --> 00:07:24.360
and I saw one in the backyard,

00:07:24.361 --> 00:07:25.444
three way up on the ridge,

00:07:25.445 --> 00:07:26.820
two in the pond, and
one on the roof.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:28.072
Okay, that's Bridget, all right?

00:07:28.073 --> 00:07:30.240
She has a problem with retardation,
but she's full of love.

Look, we're getting off
track here, all right?

00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:34.161
Why don't you just tell
me what the problem is

00:07:34.162 --> 00:07:35.371
and then maybe I can fix it?

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:36.830
Maybe if I were older,

00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:38.749
the timing would be right.

to be 35 these days

- What?

oldest line in the book.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.224
You realize that.

00:07:55.225 --> 00:07:56.558
You know what, it's okay, though.

00:07:56.559 --> 00:07:57.893
It's all right. I know
why you're saying it.

00:07:57.894 --> 00:08:00.270
It's because you don't want to
tell me that I'm the problem.

screwing 15 different guys every day

his penis inside an asshole.

rest my asshole.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.988
ALBERT: This is the square dance.

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:41.241
I almost wish you could
smile in photographs.

00:11:41.242 --> 00:11:43.619
Louise has such an amazing smile.

00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:45.788
- That'd be weird.
- Huh?

00:11:45.789 --> 00:11:47.790
Have you ever smiled
in a photograph?

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.458
- No, have you?
- Oh, God, no.

00:11:49.459 --> 00:11:51.126
No, you'd look like
an insane person.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.295
But, it's just, you know,
I've been sitting here

00:11:53.296 --> 00:11:55.506
trying to figure out how the hell

00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:57.508
I could have screwed this up.

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.468
I did everything for her.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.387
If she was happy, I was happy.

00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.514
That's all I cared about.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:08.644
(SIGHS) And she was the one
thing that made the shootings,

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:11.647
and the diseases, and the wild
animals, and the Indians,

00:12:11.648 --> 00:12:16.101
and the general depressing
awfulness about the West

00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:18.854
bearable. (SIGHS)

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:22.658
God, I love her so much.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.327
You're gonna make me cry.

00:12:25.328 --> 00:12:28.080
- Let's get fucked up.
- Yeah.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:30.657
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:12:37.173 --> 00:12:38.716
So, what are you gonna do?

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:39.842
Uh...

00:12:39.843 --> 00:12:41.468
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:42.678
Commit suicide, maybe.

00:12:42.679 --> 00:12:45.139
Albert, I know everything
seems hopeless right now,

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.767
but I promise you, there's
so much to live for.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:50.185
Really? Is there?

00:12:50.186 --> 00:12:53.522
What is there to live for on
the frontier in 1882? Huh?

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.024
Look, let me tell you something.

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:57.609
We live in a terrible
place and time.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:01.321
The American West is a disgusting,
awful, dirty, dangerous place.

00:13:01.322 --> 00:13:02.364
Look around you.

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:05.034
Everything out here that's
not you wants to kill you.

00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:08.537
Outlaws, angry drunk people,
scorned hookers, hungry animals,

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:12.041
diseases, major and minor
injuries, Indians, the weather.

00:13:12.042 --> 00:13:13.834
You can get killed just
going to the bathroom.

00:13:13.835 --> 00:13:16.879
I take my life in my hands every
time I walk out to my outhouse.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:18.881
There's fucking rattlesnakes
all in the grass out there.

00:13:18.882 --> 00:13:21.300
And even if I make it, you
know what can kill me?

00:13:21.301 --> 00:13:23.135
Cholera. You know cholera?

00:13:23.136 --> 00:13:25.220
- The Black Shit.
- The Black Shit.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:28.098
The latest offering in the frontier's
disease-of-the-month club.

00:13:28.099 --> 00:13:30.809
And even if you survive
all those things,

00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:32.019
you know what else can kill you?

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.730
The fucking doctor.
The doctor can kill you.

00:13:34.731 --> 00:13:36.357
I had a cold a couple of
years ago. I went in there.

00:13:36.358 --> 00:13:37.566
You know what he
said to me? He goes,

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:38.734
"Oh, you need an ear nail."

00:13:38.735 --> 00:13:40.361
A nail in my fucking ear.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.528
That is modern medicine for you.

00:13:41.529 --> 00:13:42.905
"Yeah, Doc, I have a fever of 102."

00:13:42.906 --> 00:13:44.573
"Oh, you need a donkey kickin'."

00:13:44.574 --> 00:13:47.826
You know our pastor has
shot two people? Our pastor.

00:13:47.827 --> 00:13:48.911
- No, no.
- No.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.371
Honest to God. Shot a guy in a duel

00:13:50.372 --> 00:13:53.082
and then went back and
killed the guy's teenage son

00:13:53.083 --> 00:13:55.042
because he was afraid he would
kill him out of revenge.

00:13:55.043 --> 00:13:56.585
Wait, how do you know that?

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.254
Because he did a whole
fucking sermon about it!

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.715
A lesson about seeing
things through.

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:03.258
By the way, look at this.
See those guys over there?

00:14:03.259 --> 00:14:05.427
The guys who work in the silver
mines? See what they're eating?

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.762
Ribs doused in hot sauce.

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:09.223
They eat hot spicy foods
every meal of the day.

00:14:09.224 --> 00:14:10.349
Do you know why?

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.434
Because their palates are so
completely fucking dulled

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:15.187
from inhaling poisoned gas, 12
hours a day, down in the mines.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.563
That's all they can taste.

00:14:16.564 --> 00:14:18.190
You know what that kind of
diet does to your guts?

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:20.943
Constipation, cramps,
dyspepsia, liver disease,

00:14:20.944 --> 00:14:23.612
kidney disease, hemorrhoids,
bowel inflammation.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:26.899
They literally die
from their own farts.

00:14:26.908 --> 00:14:29.443
(FARTS)

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.538
And, oh, oh, you want
to see more death?

00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:36.375
All we got to do is get up
and walk out the front door.

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:37.835
That is our mayor.

00:14:37.836 --> 00:14:38.919
He is dead.

00:14:38.920 --> 00:14:41.130
He has been lying there,
dead, for three days.

00:14:41.131 --> 00:14:42.631
No one has done a thing.

00:14:42.632 --> 00:14:45.592
Not moved him, not
looked into his death,

00:14:45.593 --> 00:14:47.803
not even replaced him with
a temporary appointee.

00:14:47.804 --> 00:14:51.640
For the last three days, the
highest-ranking official in our town

00:14:51.641 --> 00:14:53.225
has been a dead guy.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.644
Oh! Look at that! Look at that!

00:14:55.645 --> 00:14:59.565
Wolves are dragging the body
away as if to illustrate my point!

Bye! Bye, Mr. Mayor!

00:15:01.317 --> 00:15:03.652

of despair, and fuck all of it.

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:25.591
- Stop it.
- Okay, fine.

00:15:25.592 --> 00:15:28.844

take a look at it tomorrow.

yourself right now.

You know what's gonna happen
if I go to Dr. Harper

00:15:34.517 --> 00:15:37.603
and I say, "Take a look at that"?

00:15:37.604 --> 00:15:40.272
He's gonna say,
"Oh, that looks like it hurts.

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.858
"Let me give you a blue jay
to peck out the blood."

00:15:42.859 --> 00:15:44.610
Maybe you should...

00:15:44.611 --> 00:15:48.146
I don't know, maybe you
should try to talk to Louise.

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.700
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah?

00:15:51.701 --> 00:15:54.370
- That's the jackpot. That's the jackpot!
- Huh?

00:15:54.371 --> 00:15:56.372
- I still got it!
- Okay.

00:15:56.373 --> 00:15:58.540
I have good ideas sometimes.

00:15:58.541 --> 00:16:00.876

shouldn't drink and horse.

- It's 1:30 in the morning.
- We need to talk.

- And we need to talk tonight.
- What happened to your face?

00:17:25.587 --> 00:17:29.965

that I could not identify.

from me, but it's late.

we talked this out

00:17:43.146 --> 00:17:45.105
that we can get
somewhere and fix it.

00:17:45.106 --> 00:17:47.316
Look, Albert, you gotta go.

somebody else, just not for me.

tell us the shortest route.

Yes, sir.

00:19:19.242 --> 00:19:21.076
Oh.

You're on the main road now.

right through Bullhead

and straight through
to Sherman Creek.

of bandits and such.

- Oh.

you might do for us.

when he's found gold to sell.

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:44.243
Here, take it.

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:46.737
Pick up your gun.

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:47.913
What?

00:20:47.914 --> 00:20:51.500
Well, I'm not just gonna take
your gold. That'd be stealing.

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:54.503
You know what, old timer?
We'll shoot for it.

00:20:54.504 --> 00:20:56.046
- Clinch.
- Shut up.

00:20:56.047 --> 00:20:58.424
(CLEARS THROAT)
You just take the gold, okay?

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.843
Only a thief would do that.

00:21:00.844 --> 00:21:02.886
Are you calling me a
thief, old timer?

00:21:02.887 --> 00:21:04.263
No, no, no!

00:21:04.264 --> 00:21:07.758
Then pick up your gun.

00:21:13.023 --> 00:21:14.690
That's it.

00:21:14.691 --> 00:21:17.226
Now point it at me.

00:21:25.035 --> 00:21:27.828
We shoot on three.

00:21:27.829 --> 00:21:30.122
(GUN CLICKS)

00:21:30.123 --> 00:21:32.407
One.

00:21:33.001 --> 00:21:35.244
Two.

00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:39.173
God damn it, Clinch!

00:21:39.174 --> 00:21:40.549
You didn't have to shoot him!

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:42.092
I know I didn't have
to, sweetheart.

00:21:42.093 --> 00:21:44.636
He would've given you the gold!

00:21:44.637 --> 00:21:47.973
The point is I had
to ask him twice.

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:49.641
I'm a busy man with a schedule.

00:21:49.642 --> 00:21:51.435
You're a son of a bitch
is what you are.

00:21:51.436 --> 00:21:52.770
(GASPS)

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.106
Don't you ever say that
to me in front of my men.

00:21:56.107 --> 00:21:58.275
A man's wife will respect him.

00:21:58.276 --> 00:22:01.979
Now, let's try that again.

00:22:02.322 --> 00:22:03.572
Oh, my God, I love you.

00:22:03.573 --> 00:22:06.575
I'm, like, the luckiest girl
ever in the history of girls.

00:22:06.576 --> 00:22:11.113
That's it. Now, mount up.

00:22:12.415 --> 00:22:14.950
Hey, Clinch.

00:22:15.085 --> 00:22:16.752
Take a look.

00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:19.254
You'd lose half a day
going through Bullhead.

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:22.257
CLINCH: You, Enoch and
Jordy will ride with me.

00:22:22.258 --> 00:22:25.427
We'll take Bilbee Pass
to Sherman Creek Trail.

00:22:25.428 --> 00:22:27.596
And make no mistake about the
kind of heat we're going to draw

00:22:27.597 --> 00:22:29.431
after we take that stage.

00:22:29.432 --> 00:22:32.184
Anna, I'm gonna keep
you out of harm's way.

00:22:32.185 --> 00:22:34.603
Lewis, you take Anna and ride east

00:22:34.604 --> 00:22:37.356
and hole up here in, uh, Old Stump.

00:22:37.357 --> 00:22:38.440
You got that?

00:22:38.441 --> 00:22:40.192
We'll let things cool

00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:43.979
for a wee bit and then we'll
come for you in 12 days.

00:22:45.448 --> 00:22:47.816
(URGES HORSE)

00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:50.485

00:22:51.579 --> 00:22:53.956
(WHIMPERING)

00:22:53.957 --> 00:22:56.241
Come on, boy.

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.378
Come on, Plugger. Come on! Yeah!

00:22:59.379 --> 00:23:01.130
Good boy! Let's go!

00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:03.999
LEWIS: Oh, Jesus Christ!

00:23:07.554 --> 00:23:10.589
(BLEATING)

00:23:14.352 --> 00:23:17.521
Well, look who's up at
2:00 in the afternoon.

00:23:17.522 --> 00:23:18.981
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

00:23:18.982 --> 00:23:23.352
There's still some pig ass and
sweet cream there if you want it.

00:23:23.403 --> 00:23:25.529
(FLY BUZZING)

00:23:25.530 --> 00:23:27.740
I'm gonna use the outhouse. Um...

00:23:27.741 --> 00:23:30.993
If I die out there, will you
guys just do me one favor?

00:23:30.994 --> 00:23:33.912
Just once, I want you
to switch seats.

00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.080
Fuck off.

00:23:35.081 --> 00:23:37.333
Okay.

00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:38.542
Oh.

00:23:38.543 --> 00:23:41.086
Ah, Edward, hey. What's going on?

00:23:41.087 --> 00:23:44.214
Oh, my God. Albert,
you look terrible!

00:23:44.215 --> 00:23:46.592
Oh, wow, there's that
confidence boost I need.

00:23:46.593 --> 00:23:48.344
Thanks a lot. How you doing, buddy?

00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:50.262
Well, honestly, I'm a
little worried about you.

00:23:50.263 --> 00:23:52.181
I haven't seen you in
town in a week and a half

00:23:52.182 --> 00:23:55.517
and, you know, it seems like you're
just staying in and sleeping all day.

00:23:55.518 --> 00:23:59.104
(STAMMERING) No, I don't
stay home all day. I go out.

00:23:59.105 --> 00:24:00.356
You know what I did on Tuesday?

00:24:00.357 --> 00:24:02.191
I went out to Charlie
Blanche's ranch

00:24:02.192 --> 00:24:03.359
and I paid him the money I owe him

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.110
so he won't shoot me
in the fucking face.

00:24:05.111 --> 00:24:06.445
I did that. That's going out.

00:24:06.446 --> 00:24:08.238
Well, that's not really what
I'm talking about. (CHUCKLES)

00:24:08.239 --> 00:24:09.907
Okay, look. Here's the
truth, all right?

00:24:09.908 --> 00:24:12.117
I just feel like I need to
stay here with my parents.

00:24:12.118 --> 00:24:14.161
They're not gonna be
around much longer

00:24:14.162 --> 00:24:17.539
and I just want to be able to give
back all the love and affection

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.375
that I got growing up.

00:24:19.376 --> 00:24:20.626
You know? Right, guys?

00:24:20.627 --> 00:24:21.877
(FARTS) Ow!

00:24:21.878 --> 00:24:23.754
Oh, you getting the fart
needles again, Dad?

00:24:23.755 --> 00:24:25.506
Never mind what I'm getting!

00:24:25.507 --> 00:24:28.884
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)
I love him so much!

00:24:28.885 --> 00:24:32.137
Albert, I know you're taking this
breakup really hard, and I understand,

00:24:32.138 --> 00:24:33.722
but you got to get
out of this funk.

00:24:33.723 --> 00:24:36.767
I mean, you haven't shorn
your sheep in weeks.

00:24:36.768 --> 00:24:39.261
(BLEATING)

00:24:40.063 --> 00:24:41.772
Look, you don't know what
this is like, all right.

00:24:41.773 --> 00:24:44.316
With all due respect, you have no
fucking clue what this is like.

00:24:44.317 --> 00:24:46.026
All right? You're going
home every night

00:24:46.027 --> 00:24:47.653
to your girlfriend who loves you.

00:24:47.654 --> 00:24:49.947
- You're having sex with her, and you...
- Ah...

00:24:49.948 --> 00:24:54.743
No, Ruth and I have...
We've never done that.

00:24:54.744 --> 00:24:56.954
What do you mean you've...

00:24:56.955 --> 00:24:59.415
You've never had sex with Ruth?

00:24:59.416 --> 00:25:02.751
Yeah. No, no. Yeah.

00:25:02.752 --> 00:25:06.463
Wait, doesn't she have sex with, like,
10 guys every day at the whorehouse?

00:25:06.464 --> 00:25:08.757
On a slow day, yeah.

00:25:08.758 --> 00:25:10.259
But you guys have never had sex?

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:13.929
No. No, Ruth wants to wait
until we get married.

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:16.432
You know, she's a
Christian and so am I,

00:25:16.433 --> 00:25:20.394
and we want to save ourselves
for our wedding night.

00:25:20.395 --> 00:25:22.896
Edward, have you... Have you
ever had sex with anyone?

00:25:22.897 --> 00:25:24.815
Well, there was some shit with
my uncle, but that was...

00:25:24.816 --> 00:25:28.944
You know, it's really hard
to remember all that stuff.

00:25:28.945 --> 00:25:30.320
You know, yeah, you're right.

00:25:30.321 --> 00:25:31.405
Things could be a lot worse.

00:25:31.406 --> 00:25:32.489
Yeah.

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.200
Um, I'll get out, I'll meet
some people. Yeah, thanks.

00:25:35.201 --> 00:25:36.577
- Okay.

00:25:36.578 --> 00:25:40.614
Ow! That came out of my penis!

00:25:42.584 --> 00:25:45.169
EDWARD: Man, I see kids everywhere
with those stick hoops lately.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:47.254
I know. Me, too.

00:25:47.255 --> 00:25:48.839
It's got to be bad for
their brains, right?

00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:50.466
Yeah, it stunts their
attention span.

00:25:50.467 --> 00:25:51.717
I read an article in the paper.

00:25:51.718 --> 00:25:54.219
Yeah, I saw that. It's like
they lose the power to innovate

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:55.888
because they're staring at
the stick hoop all day.

00:25:55.889 --> 00:25:57.097
Yep.

00:25:57.098 --> 00:25:59.558
Oh, by the way, they're delivering
the town's ice shipment today.

00:25:59.559 --> 00:26:00.726
You want to go watch?

00:26:00.727 --> 00:26:02.227
- Oh, yeah, that'd be fun.
- Yeah!

00:26:02.228 --> 00:26:04.396
Yeah. It's always a thrill
when you get to see

00:26:04.397 --> 00:26:06.148
that much ice all in one place.

00:26:06.149 --> 00:26:07.816
Yeah, I think so, too.
I'm really excited.

00:26:07.817 --> 00:26:10.561
Edward, Edward, look, look.

00:26:14.032 --> 00:26:16.400
Holy shit.

00:26:17.118 --> 00:26:18.160
Fucking Foy.

00:26:18.161 --> 00:26:20.120
She told me she didn't
want to see anybody.

00:26:20.121 --> 00:26:22.081
She told me she had
to work on herself.

00:26:22.082 --> 00:26:23.540
Look at that.

00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:25.376
Oh, my God. Fucking Foy!

00:26:26.961 --> 00:26:28.796
Oh, look at that. He's kissing her.

00:26:28.797 --> 00:26:30.464
- EDWARD: He's frenching her.
- ALBERT: Fucking Foy!

00:26:30.465 --> 00:26:32.132
Maybe you should grow a moustache.

00:26:32.133 --> 00:26:33.717
No, I can't afford it.

00:26:33.718 --> 00:26:36.220
The creams, the waxes, the lotions.

00:26:36.221 --> 00:26:37.596
I don't have the money.

00:26:37.597 --> 00:26:38.681
Fucking Foy!

00:26:38.682 --> 00:26:40.599
Hey, Albert, maybe we
should just go to church.

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.975
It'll make you feel a lot better.

00:26:41.976 --> 00:26:43.018
Church is not gonna...

00:26:43.019 --> 00:26:45.804

So it doesn't melt.

EDWARD: Oh.

00:26:51.611 --> 00:26:53.195
That's so neat.

00:26:53.196 --> 00:26:54.822
I know. It's actually really
interesting how they do it.

00:26:54.823 --> 00:26:57.324
It's this one company out in Boston

00:26:57.325 --> 00:26:59.993
that basically cuts
it in big blocks

00:26:59.994 --> 00:27:03.539
from frozen lakes and ponds,
and they just ship it all over the...

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:09.920
That went south so fast!

at the teat of our coffers.

00:27:26.604 --> 00:27:29.440
And that's just exactly
like that part in the Bible

00:27:29.441 --> 00:27:31.692
that applies to that situation.

00:27:31.693 --> 00:27:35.112
I would also like to
offer a heartfelt prayer

00:27:35.113 --> 00:27:37.239
to the family of James Addison,

00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.158
who was killed this morning

00:27:39.159 --> 00:27:40.826
while unloading the ice shipment.

00:27:40.827 --> 00:27:44.038
James, we will think of
you lovingly this July

00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:46.582
as we sip the cold summer beverages

00:27:46.583 --> 00:27:48.292
for which you gave your life.

00:27:48.293 --> 00:27:50.627
(WHISPERING) They're still
gonna use the fucking ice.

Now, before we end this
morning's service,

00:27:52.756 --> 00:27:56.633
I would like to welcome two
new members to our community.

00:27:56.634 --> 00:27:59.595
Lewis Barnes and his sister, Anna.

00:27:59.596 --> 00:28:01.472
They've just moved
here to Old Stump

00:28:01.473 --> 00:28:03.432
and they plan to build a farm.

00:28:03.433 --> 00:28:05.351
And we wish them all the luck.

00:28:05.352 --> 00:28:07.811
Well, that concludes
today's service.

00:28:07.812 --> 00:28:09.772
So, may God bless you
for another week

00:28:09.773 --> 00:28:12.441
and there is a mountain
lion warning in effect.

Hey, you.

00:28:29.793 --> 00:28:31.460
- So, the fair's coming up...
- Mmm?

00:28:31.461 --> 00:28:35.297
and I was thinking that we
could go dress shopping later.

00:28:35.298 --> 00:28:37.424
I was thinking you
need a new dress.

00:28:37.425 --> 00:28:39.301
(GASPS) Something expensive?

00:28:39.302 --> 00:28:40.969
Stupidly expensive!

Okay. (CHUCKLES)

seen you in here before.

00:29:02.492 --> 00:29:04.201
Just browsing.

00:29:04.202 --> 00:29:05.869
Yeah.

00:29:05.870 --> 00:29:08.497
You don't have a moustache, though.

00:29:08.498 --> 00:29:11.500
No, I know. I was thinking
about growing one.

00:29:11.501 --> 00:29:12.584
I'm sorry, I can't...

00:29:12.585 --> 00:29:15.170
- I said I was thinking about growing one.
- Oh.

00:29:15.171 --> 00:29:18.507
Excuse me, I have to
use the powder room.

00:29:18.508 --> 00:29:22.886
And just what kind of moustache
are you looking to grow?

00:29:22.887 --> 00:29:25.514
Um, a big one.

00:29:25.515 --> 00:29:27.516
Like one of those
ones that goes down

00:29:27.517 --> 00:29:29.560
along the side of my mouth,

00:29:29.561 --> 00:29:32.980
and then goes up the
edge of my jaw,

00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:36.525
and then becomes my sideburns,

00:29:36.526 --> 00:29:39.486
and then becomes my hair.

00:29:39.487 --> 00:29:40.654
A MÃ¶bius moustache.

00:29:40.655 --> 00:29:43.490
MÃ¶bius moustache, that's the one.

00:29:43.491 --> 00:29:45.701
Yeah. Um...

00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:47.619
You should know that
kind of moustache

00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.831
is a very costly facial accessory.

00:29:50.832 --> 00:29:51.999
Yeah, I know that.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.418
Well, you're a sheep farmer.

00:29:54.419 --> 00:29:56.628
(SCOFFS)

00:29:56.629 --> 00:29:58.881
Let me ask you something. You feel
good about what you're doing?

00:29:58.882 --> 00:30:00.090
What exactly am I doing?

00:30:00.091 --> 00:30:01.925
Stealing a guy's girlfriend.
That's what you're doing.

00:30:01.926 --> 00:30:03.052
You feel good about that?

00:30:03.053 --> 00:30:05.054
Hey, Louise dumped you, my friend.

00:30:05.055 --> 00:30:08.057
It's not my fault she wanted
someone with more to offer.

00:30:08.058 --> 00:30:10.351
I can give her a lavish home.

00:30:10.352 --> 00:30:13.896
Warm blankets, wrapped candies.

00:30:13.897 --> 00:30:15.856
Can you say the same, Albert?

00:30:15.857 --> 00:30:19.360
Can you give Louise
wrapped candies?

00:30:19.361 --> 00:30:20.944
You know what? Fuck you, man.

00:30:20.945 --> 00:30:24.782
Yeah, that's what she's doing.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

00:30:24.783 --> 00:30:27.276
(SIGHS)

(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

00:30:54.062 --> 00:30:55.270
Oh, hey, sweetie.

00:30:55.271 --> 00:30:56.438
Hi!

00:30:56.439 --> 00:30:58.107
- Hi, Mark.
- Hey, Ed.

00:30:58.108 --> 00:31:00.609
Wow! What a long day!

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:01.819
Oh, what happened?

00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.365
Oh, gosh! Well, like, this one
man wanted me to smoke a cigar

00:31:06.366 --> 00:31:09.702
and then ash on his balls
while I'm jerking him off,

00:31:09.703 --> 00:31:12.788
and I'm like, "What?
Can I do all that?"

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:14.373
(LAUGHING)

00:31:14.374 --> 00:31:16.709
Yeah.

00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:19.128
You know, uh, Ruth,
I've been thinking.

00:31:19.129 --> 00:31:21.496
About what?

00:31:21.631 --> 00:31:23.132
Well, I love you.

00:31:23.133 --> 00:31:25.050
Well, I love you, too.

00:31:25.051 --> 00:31:28.470
And we've been together
for a long time.

00:31:28.471 --> 00:31:29.596
Wh...

00:31:29.597 --> 00:31:34.893
What do you think about us
spending the night together?

00:31:34.894 --> 00:31:38.147
You mean having sex?

00:31:38.148 --> 00:31:39.898
Maybe not right away, you know?

00:31:39.899 --> 00:31:42.109
We could maybe lie together
for the first couple of times

00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:43.736
and see how it feels,
and then go from there.

00:31:43.737 --> 00:31:45.404
But, Eddie, we're Christians.

00:31:45.405 --> 00:31:46.989
I know we're Christians

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:50.325
and I want to do the correct
thing in the eyes of the Lord.

00:31:50.326 --> 00:31:53.328
But if we really do
love each other,

00:31:53.329 --> 00:31:55.581
don't you think God
would be okay with it?

00:31:55.582 --> 00:31:58.000
I don't know.

00:31:58.001 --> 00:32:01.170
I mean, you're talking about
pre-marital relations.

00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:04.673
Oh! You've got a little thing
right here. I'll get it.

00:32:04.674 --> 00:32:07.468
Oops. Oopsie.

00:32:07.469 --> 00:32:09.511
- Thank you.
- Oh.

00:32:09.512 --> 00:32:10.637
That's it, I'm out.

00:32:10.638 --> 00:32:11.930
What?

00:32:11.931 --> 00:32:15.142
I'm done. I'm leaving.
I'm going to San Francisco.

00:32:15.143 --> 00:32:17.144
What, are you serious?
Because of Louise?

00:32:17.145 --> 00:32:20.856
Yes, I'm serious. And, yes,
it is because of Louise.

00:32:20.857 --> 00:32:22.191
I don't know how I
lasted this long.

00:32:22.192 --> 00:32:24.151
I hate the frontier,
I hate everything in it.

00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:27.154
Well, what am I gonna do?
I'm your best friend.

00:32:27.155 --> 00:32:31.992
I know. That's... That's why
I want you to have these.

00:32:31.993 --> 00:32:34.244
Albert, these are
your favorite socks.

00:32:34.245 --> 00:32:36.697
Yeah.

00:32:36.706 --> 00:32:39.741
And I want you to have that.

00:32:42.587 --> 00:32:44.213
Edward, this is your
lucky handkerchief.

00:32:44.214 --> 00:32:45.589
Yeah.

00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:48.834
It's sticky.

00:32:49.427 --> 00:32:52.179
Well, hello to you, too!

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.890
James, I found the friendly locals.
(CHUCKLES)

00:32:54.891 --> 00:32:58.811
So he said, "Why don't you
go blow your own horse?"

00:32:58.812 --> 00:33:00.062
(LAUGHS)

00:33:00.063 --> 00:33:02.356
Hey, watch it, pal.

00:33:02.357 --> 00:33:04.566
I think you owe me a drink, fella.

00:33:04.567 --> 00:33:06.402
The hell I do.

00:33:06.403 --> 00:33:08.320
You best watch where you stand.

00:33:08.321 --> 00:33:11.281
I don't think you heard me.

00:33:11.282 --> 00:33:13.242
I'm thirsty.

00:33:13.243 --> 00:33:18.113
Then why don't you go on down
the river and take a dunk?

00:33:18.415 --> 00:33:21.074
Last chance, kid.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:38.809

(GRUNTS)

00:33:50.113 --> 00:33:53.365

00:33:53.366 --> 00:33:55.817

(GROANING)

00:34:00.623 --> 00:34:02.666
We got our own thing
going on over here.

00:34:02.667 --> 00:34:04.293
Yeah, nobody needs
to get in on this.

00:34:04.294 --> 00:34:06.420
We're both getting
hurt pretty badly.

Nobody needs to come over here.

00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:15.054
This fight is way more
violent than yours...

00:34:15.055 --> 00:34:17.473
All those other guys' fights.

00:34:17.474 --> 00:34:19.800

- (GROANING)
- Oh!

00:34:31.154 --> 00:34:32.488
You actually hit me!

00:34:32.489 --> 00:34:33.614
I'm so sorry.

00:34:33.615 --> 00:34:34.698
You fucker!

00:34:34.699 --> 00:34:36.033
I put a new move in there.

00:34:36.034 --> 00:34:37.409
You don't just put a new move in.

00:34:37.410 --> 00:34:39.861
That's why we have the meetings.

00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:44.491
(GROANING)

00:34:46.503 --> 00:34:48.337
That's where it hurts.
Like, right there.

00:34:48.338 --> 00:34:49.713
Like, right underneath my eye.

00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:51.006
Yeah, there's a little red spot.

00:34:51.007 --> 00:34:52.758
Ow! Careful, it's tender.

- Sure.

00:35:24.541 --> 00:35:26.083
Sorry about that.

00:35:26.084 --> 00:35:28.127
It's kind of a regular
occurrence around here.

- Really?
- Yeah.

- Oh...
- I guess you're a real hero.

Me? No, I'm not the hero.

I'm the guy in the crowd making
fun of the hero's shirt.

00:35:43.143 --> 00:35:44.601
- That's who I am.
- Oh.

00:35:44.602 --> 00:35:48.188
- Hey, look who's here.
- Who's this?

00:35:48.189 --> 00:35:49.356
This is Plugger.

00:35:49.357 --> 00:35:51.934
Hey, Plugger.

00:35:52.485 --> 00:35:55.446
So, that... That was your
brother in there, huh?

00:35:55.447 --> 00:35:58.907
Yeah, Lewis. He's always
been a little rambunctious.

00:35:58.908 --> 00:36:02.494
Yeah, he seems like a great guy.
I'm Albert, by the way.

Welcome to our awesome town.

00:36:09.252 --> 00:36:10.586
Thanks.

00:36:10.587 --> 00:36:12.963
Lewis and I just came
out from Kansas City.

00:36:12.964 --> 00:36:14.465
Oh, Kansas.

00:36:14.466 --> 00:36:16.258
No, it's in Missouri.

00:36:16.259 --> 00:36:18.761
Oh, right. That's
annoying and weird.

00:36:18.762 --> 00:36:19.928
We were wanting a change,

00:36:19.929 --> 00:36:22.890
so we came out to the frontier
looking to build a farm.

00:36:22.891 --> 00:36:24.391
- Oh, that's what I do.
- Really?

00:36:24.392 --> 00:36:26.602
Yeah, I got a farm about
2 miles from here.

00:36:26.603 --> 00:36:27.895
Oh, cattle?

00:36:27.896 --> 00:36:29.521
Uh, no, sheep.

00:36:29.522 --> 00:36:31.106
- Oh.
- Yep.

00:36:31.107 --> 00:36:33.734
Well, that's got to be
fulfilling work, though, right?

00:36:33.735 --> 00:36:34.943
Ah, yeah, it's great.

00:36:34.944 --> 00:36:38.489
It's like being a dog walker
for 150 really stupid dogs.

00:36:38.490 --> 00:36:39.823
(LAUGHS)

00:36:39.824 --> 00:36:41.575
- ALBERT: Oh, shit, Plugger!
- ANNA: Oh, my God!

00:36:41.576 --> 00:36:43.577
- Plugger, give it to me. (GROANING)
- Jesus, what is that?

00:36:43.578 --> 00:36:45.662
It's the mayor.

00:36:45.663 --> 00:36:47.164
- (GLASS SHATTERS)
- (WOMAN SCREAMING)

00:36:47.165 --> 00:36:50.158
Oh, shit!

00:36:50.794 --> 00:36:53.379
So, how did you guys meet?

00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:56.131
Uh, she moved to town
a couple years ago

00:36:56.132 --> 00:36:59.134
to take over the schoolmarm job.

00:36:59.135 --> 00:37:03.681
Our old schoolmarm got her throat
slit by a fast-moving tumbleweed.

00:37:03.682 --> 00:37:05.474
- Oh, my God!
- Yeah.

00:37:05.475 --> 00:37:06.767
In front of the kids?

00:37:06.768 --> 00:37:09.103
Oh, yeah. Yeah. All of them.

00:37:09.104 --> 00:37:10.312
ANNA: Let me help you.

00:37:10.313 --> 00:37:14.182
That is just painful to watch.

00:37:15.443 --> 00:37:19.863
And, you know, it's like the
whole time we were together

00:37:19.864 --> 00:37:22.741
I just remember thinking,

00:37:22.742 --> 00:37:26.695
"How can I possibly be this happy?

00:37:26.705 --> 00:37:27.788
"She likes me now,

00:37:27.789 --> 00:37:29.748
"but one day, she
is gonna figure out

00:37:29.749 --> 00:37:32.534
"that she is too good for me."

00:37:32.919 --> 00:37:37.414
And then one day, she did.

00:37:37.841 --> 00:37:43.795
I feel like I finally tricked one
girl into falling in love with me

00:37:44.055 --> 00:37:46.849
and then I lost her.

00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:50.594
I think you have this
whole thing upside down.

00:37:50.603 --> 00:37:53.188
I mean, it sounds like you've bent
over backwards for this girl,

00:37:53.189 --> 00:37:54.732
but what has she given you back?

00:37:54.733 --> 00:37:57.359
I told you, she allowed
me to be happy

00:37:57.360 --> 00:37:59.695
in a part of the world that
is otherwise a living hell.

00:37:59.696 --> 00:38:01.613
"Allowed"? Wow.

00:38:01.614 --> 00:38:03.615
That's kind of fucked up that
you would use that word.

00:38:03.616 --> 00:38:05.909
You know that, right?

00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:09.621
All I know is that there
is nothing for me out here

00:38:09.622 --> 00:38:12.115
if I don't have her.

00:38:12.625 --> 00:38:14.418
ANNA: Well,

00:38:14.419 --> 00:38:17.296
if this Foy guy is
that much of a douche,

00:38:17.297 --> 00:38:20.591
she'll figure it out
if she's smart.

00:38:20.592 --> 00:38:23.218
Sometimes a girl has to get a
few assholes out of her system

00:38:23.219 --> 00:38:25.721
before she realizes what
a good guy looks like.

- It's a diamondback, yeah.
- Fuck.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.912
It's okay, just hold perfectly
still, and it'll go away.

00:38:49.913 --> 00:38:52.489
Okay, okay.

00:38:54.751 --> 00:38:57.795
I don't think you
should leave tomorrow.

00:38:57.796 --> 00:38:59.755
At least stay through the weekend.

00:38:59.756 --> 00:39:01.423
Isn't the fair on Saturday?

00:39:01.424 --> 00:39:04.718
Oh, fuck that. I'm not
going to the stupid fair.

00:39:04.719 --> 00:39:06.970
Louise is gonna be there,
and she's gonna be with Foy.

00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:08.305
I don't want to put myself through

00:39:08.306 --> 00:39:09.765

Yeah, well, I'll go with you.

No better way to make your
ex-girlfriend want you back more

00:39:14.479 --> 00:39:16.814
than to let her see you
with another girl.

I don't know.

Especially a smoking-hot girl.

00:39:20.777 --> 00:39:24.238
When she sees me, she'll
be intimidated as fuck.

00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:26.115
Oh, you're very modest, I see.

00:39:26.116 --> 00:39:29.076

But I got great tits.

You stupid son of a bitch.

00:40:06.281 --> 00:40:08.365
You shot the pastor's son.

You realize they're probably
gonna hang you for this?

Who gives a fuck what they want?

00:40:14.622 --> 00:40:17.833
When Clinch gets into town, it's
not gonna matter what they do.

00:40:17.834 --> 00:40:19.043
He'll bust me out

00:40:19.044 --> 00:40:22.871
and anyone who tries to stop
him is gonna be a dead man.

00:40:26.509 --> 00:40:29.511
You know, one of these days

there's gonna be a man
who's faster than Clinch

00:40:32.515 --> 00:40:35.851
and tougher, and stronger.

00:40:35.852 --> 00:40:38.979
And then Clinch is
gonna be the dead man.

00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:41.690
And I'm gonna smoke a
fucking cigar to celebrate.

00:40:41.691 --> 00:40:46.028
(SCOFFS) I don't think Clinch would
like you talking about him that way.

Not a nice thing for a man's
wife to say about her husband.

fine how-do-you-do?"

00:47:57.877 --> 00:47:59.336
(LAUGHING HARDER)

00:47:59.337 --> 00:48:01.505
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)

00:48:01.506 --> 00:48:04.049
(STAMMERING) How is that funny?
What's funny about that?

00:48:04.050 --> 00:48:05.968
"How do you do" is a greeting.
Why is that funny?

00:48:05.969 --> 00:48:07.594
You, why are you laughing?

00:48:07.595 --> 00:48:11.340
I don't know. He was laughing.

00:48:11.474 --> 00:48:14.268
It seems your ex-boyfriend
doesn't have a sense of humor.

00:48:14.269 --> 00:48:15.811
I can see why you dumped him.

00:48:15.812 --> 00:48:17.563
Hey!

00:48:17.564 --> 00:48:19.356
You wanna back up that
attitude, asshole?

00:48:19.357 --> 00:48:20.607
Oh, you are kidding.

00:48:20.608 --> 00:48:23.277
Never been more serious in
my life. You and me, pistols.

00:48:23.278 --> 00:48:24.778
You wouldn't have a prayer, kiddo.

00:48:24.779 --> 00:48:26.530
Tomorrow, 8:00 a.m., sharp.

00:48:26.531 --> 00:48:28.365
All right, challenge accepted!

00:48:28.366 --> 00:48:30.367
Oh, gosh. Tomorrow is bad for me,

00:48:30.368 --> 00:48:32.161
and I really wanna be there.

00:48:32.162 --> 00:48:34.288
Why don't we say a week from today?

00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:36.498
That works for you, right, Albert?

00:48:36.499 --> 00:48:39.460
Yeah, yeah, that's fine.
A week from today.

00:48:39.461 --> 00:48:42.921
I got sheep stuff I gotta
do tomorrow, anyway.

00:48:42.922 --> 00:48:44.631
One week.

00:48:44.632 --> 00:48:45.799
Come on, Louise.

00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:48.510
I'll buy you some sugared
butter shavings.

00:48:48.511 --> 00:48:50.879
(IMITATING BLEATING)

00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:55.559
Oh, shit!

00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.685
Wow.

00:48:56.686 --> 00:48:59.021
What the fuck did I just do?

00:48:59.022 --> 00:49:02.232
You just challenged
Foy to a gunfight.

00:49:02.233 --> 00:49:03.484
I have no idea what just happened.

00:49:03.485 --> 00:49:05.110
(STAMMERING)
I was, like, out of my body.

00:49:05.111 --> 00:49:07.446
Albert, did you see the
look on Louise's face?

00:49:07.447 --> 00:49:08.572
No. Why?

00:49:08.573 --> 00:49:11.575
She was aroused. She was impressed.

00:49:11.576 --> 00:49:14.661
You had a fire in your belly
for a second there, pal.

00:49:14.662 --> 00:49:16.538
Bet you never showed
her that side before.

00:49:16.539 --> 00:49:18.374
Yeah, I don't have that side to me.

00:49:18.375 --> 00:49:20.084
I honestly don't know
what just happened.

00:49:20.085 --> 00:49:21.919
Albert, you got her attention.

00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:23.379
You beat this guy at a gunfight,

00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:25.547
I bet she thinks twice
about dumping you.

00:49:25.548 --> 00:49:27.216
Anna, I can't be in a gunfight.

00:49:27.217 --> 00:49:28.300
What am I, Clinch Leatherwood here?

00:49:28.301 --> 00:49:30.219
- I'll get killed!
- Whoa!

00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:32.346
Why would you say that?

00:49:32.347 --> 00:49:35.391
Because he's the most vicious
gunfighter in the territory,

00:49:35.392 --> 00:49:36.558
which I am not!

00:49:36.559 --> 00:49:39.520
No, you're not Clinch Leatherwood.

00:49:39.521 --> 00:49:41.063
You're gonna be okay, Albert.

00:49:41.064 --> 00:49:43.732
That week I just bought you is enough
time for me to teach you how to shoot.

00:49:43.733 --> 00:49:44.858
You'll be fine.

00:49:44.859 --> 00:49:46.151
Oh, yeah, by the way,
that's another thing.

00:49:46.152 --> 00:49:48.153
How the fuck can you
shoot like that?

00:49:48.154 --> 00:49:49.655
Who the hell are you?

00:49:49.656 --> 00:49:53.492
My father was a gun maker. I could
shoot a gun before I could walk.

00:49:53.493 --> 00:49:56.495
Whatever. I'm sick to my stomach.
My stomach is in knots.

00:49:56.496 --> 00:49:58.414
You're worked up, that's
what it is. Let's get a drink.

00:49:58.415 --> 00:49:59.581
Come on.

00:49:59.582 --> 00:50:01.959
Hey! It's our sweet young couple.

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.954
Could I interest you folks
in some Wildroot Cream-Oil?

People die at the fair.

00:50:32.115 --> 00:50:34.742
ANNA: Okay, so you're gonna
take your right thumb,

00:50:34.743 --> 00:50:36.243
put it all the way to the left.

00:50:36.244 --> 00:50:38.996
Cross it over, cradle
it right in there,

00:50:38.997 --> 00:50:40.497
and then just extend it
straight through your...

00:50:40.498 --> 00:50:42.082
- Like that?
- Straight.

00:50:42.083 --> 00:50:44.585
Wow, you've never
fired a gun before.

00:50:44.586 --> 00:50:46.420
I... I have not. I own a gun.

00:50:46.421 --> 00:50:48.213
No, I fired a gun at
the shooting gallery.

00:50:48.214 --> 00:50:50.341
Yeah, but those were quarter loads.
These are full loads.

00:50:50.342 --> 00:50:54.219
Okay, all right, get ready. I'm about
to shoot a full load at your cans.

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.263
(LAUGHING)
Shut the fuck up and focus.

00:50:56.264 --> 00:50:58.507

This is never gonna work.

00:51:07.150 --> 00:51:08.984
- This is not working.
- It's gonna work.

00:51:08.985 --> 00:51:11.403
It's gonna work and Louise is
gonna come running back to you.

00:51:11.404 --> 00:51:12.654
How the hell do you
get these things out?

00:51:12.655 --> 00:51:13.864
(LAUGHING)

00:51:13.865 --> 00:51:16.867
I'm sitting there
jerking that thing off.

00:51:16.868 --> 00:51:19.486
(SIGHS)

00:51:19.579 --> 00:51:21.622
Hey, why are you
being so nice to me?

00:51:21.623 --> 00:51:22.831
What do you mean?

00:51:22.832 --> 00:51:25.209
Well, I mean, you show
up out of nowhere.

00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:29.546
You're this complete anomaly in my
world of terribleness out here.

00:51:29.547 --> 00:51:32.424
I mean, you must have a million
better things to do than this.

00:51:32.425 --> 00:51:34.677
What, I can't make a new friend?

00:51:34.678 --> 00:51:36.845
You sure look like
you could use one.

00:51:36.846 --> 00:51:40.057
I guess. I mean, I just... I just
don't know anything about you.

00:51:40.058 --> 00:51:42.101
Well, can I ask you
something about you?

00:51:42.102 --> 00:51:44.386
Yeah, sure.

00:51:44.521 --> 00:51:47.264
Why do you love Louise?

00:51:47.774 --> 00:51:50.776
(SIGHS)
I mean, take your pick. She's...

00:51:50.777 --> 00:51:52.277
I feel great when I'm with her.

00:51:52.278 --> 00:51:56.240
She's classy, she's fun,
she's insanely gorgeous.

00:51:56.241 --> 00:51:59.118
Hey, no. Look, she's
really pretty, yes.

00:51:59.119 --> 00:52:00.869
But honestly, and I'm
sorry to say this,

00:52:00.870 --> 00:52:03.038
I don't see what else
she's got going for her.

00:52:03.039 --> 00:52:06.709
My impression was that she was a
little sour and self-absorbed.

00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:08.836
And for a guy with so
much going for him,

00:52:08.837 --> 00:52:10.087
I just thought that maybe you...

00:52:10.088 --> 00:52:12.464
I don't know what you think
I have going for me, but...

00:52:12.465 --> 00:52:13.966
You see? There you go again,

00:52:13.967 --> 00:52:15.217
just cutting yourself down.

00:52:15.218 --> 00:52:16.927
You act like this
girl was performing

00:52:16.928 --> 00:52:19.138
some kind of a charitable
act by dating you.

00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:20.514
Albert, you're a catch.

00:52:20.515 --> 00:52:22.975
You're sweet, you're
funny, you're smart.

00:52:22.976 --> 00:52:24.852
You've made something
of yourself out here.

00:52:24.853 --> 00:52:26.395
You know, a lot of
people can't say that.

00:52:26.396 --> 00:52:27.980
You're a good sheep farmer.

00:52:27.981 --> 00:52:30.566
Oh, my God, please.
I suck at sheep.

00:52:30.567 --> 00:52:32.109
Louise was right. I can't
keep track of them.

00:52:32.110 --> 00:52:33.902
There was a sheep in the
whorehouse last week.

00:52:33.903 --> 00:52:35.320
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:52:35.321 --> 00:52:37.322
Wandered in there, and then
when I went to pick it up,

00:52:37.323 --> 00:52:39.074
somehow, it had made $20.

00:52:39.075 --> 00:52:41.610
(LAUGHING)

00:52:42.620 --> 00:52:46.915
But, you know, thank you
anyway for what you said.

00:52:46.916 --> 00:52:49.835
Oh, look, the West fucking sucks,

00:52:49.836 --> 00:52:51.587
but the frontier is
not your problem.

00:52:51.588 --> 00:52:52.755
It's you.

00:52:52.756 --> 00:52:54.923
You need a little confidence
boost, my friend.

00:52:54.924 --> 00:52:57.459
Now, aim up, sheep boy.

00:53:06.311 --> 00:53:07.770
- Oh!
- Hey!

00:53:07.771 --> 00:53:09.188
- There we go!
- See? There!

00:53:09.189 --> 00:53:10.814
All righty. That's one.

00:53:10.815 --> 00:53:15.611
So, all I gotta do is get Foy to let
me shoot 16 times before he shoots

00:53:15.612 --> 00:53:16.862
and then I win!

00:53:16.863 --> 00:53:18.280
You're gonna do great, I promise.

00:53:18.281 --> 00:53:20.983
- Easy.
- We're gonna get there.

- Yes!

(SCREAMING)

00:55:19.027 --> 00:55:20.110
Oh!

00:55:20.111 --> 00:55:24.231
God damn it, Albert!
No more friends!

00:55:30.955 --> 00:55:32.748
ANNA:
You know, you did great today.

00:55:32.749 --> 00:55:34.750
So much better than last week.

00:55:34.751 --> 00:55:37.753
And I have a surprise for you.

00:55:37.754 --> 00:55:40.047
You have earned one of Anna Barnes'

00:55:40.048 --> 00:55:44.251
very special
super-super-secret cookies.

00:55:44.761 --> 00:55:47.096
Mmm-hmm.

00:55:47.097 --> 00:55:49.014
- Wait, what is this?
- Mmm-hmm?

00:55:49.015 --> 00:55:50.974
This is a pot... This is
a pot cookie, isn't it?

00:55:50.975 --> 00:55:52.309
- It's a pot cookie.
- No, no, no.

00:55:52.310 --> 00:55:53.435
No. I don't do well
with that stuff at all.

00:55:53.436 --> 00:55:54.520
It's a pot cookie.

00:55:54.521 --> 00:55:56.313
Yeah, I know. No, thank you.

00:55:56.314 --> 00:55:57.564
Just have a little bit with me.

00:55:57.565 --> 00:56:00.401
My worst fear is to OD
on a recreational drug.

00:56:00.402 --> 00:56:01.860
- (STAMMERS) No, thank you.
- On a pot cookie?

00:56:01.861 --> 00:56:03.487
The last time somebody
gave me one of these

00:56:03.488 --> 00:56:05.948
I became convinced that prairie
dogs could read my mind.

00:56:05.949 --> 00:56:07.866
Just take a little bit.

00:56:07.867 --> 00:56:09.702
- I'll take a very, very small bite.
- Just a small bite.

00:56:09.703 --> 00:56:12.905
- A very small bite.
- That's it.

00:56:14.249 --> 00:56:15.541
Are you kidding me?

00:56:15.542 --> 00:56:17.126
Nope. Deadly serious.

00:56:17.127 --> 00:56:18.794
- (LAUGHING)
- Let's see what this does

00:56:18.795 --> 00:56:20.337
and if I don't throw
myself off this cliff

00:56:20.338 --> 00:56:21.839
during some awful
freak-out, then...

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:23.507
Just take that little
bit, right there.

00:56:23.508 --> 00:56:25.551
- Well, now you've touched it.
- (LAUGHING)

00:56:25.552 --> 00:56:29.888
Take the other side. There you go.

00:56:29.889 --> 00:56:32.141
There.

00:56:32.142 --> 00:56:35.886
And now, we just wait
for the sun to set.

00:56:46.698 --> 00:56:49.491
This is really weird.

00:56:49.492 --> 00:56:52.694
- Is it supposed to be like this?
- (CHUCKLING)

00:56:54.247 --> 00:56:55.456
You gave me the right
amount, right?

00:56:55.457 --> 00:56:59.284
You don't think I took too much?

00:57:00.462 --> 00:57:02.921
- Just ride it out.
- This is...

00:57:02.922 --> 00:57:05.299
Wow, my bones are in
really deep today.

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.635
Like, there's a lot more
skin than there usually is.

00:57:08.636 --> 00:57:10.679
I think my body is padding
up for the winter,

00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:12.139
which is weird, because
it's not winter.

00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.390
But there's a lot more there.

00:57:13.391 --> 00:57:14.892

(SWALLOWING)

00:57:19.064 --> 00:57:21.815
There's something wrong
with my swallowing.

00:57:21.816 --> 00:57:23.484
This is not how I usually swallow.

00:57:23.485 --> 00:57:24.610
(SQUEAKING)

00:57:24.611 --> 00:57:25.778
Oh, my God, Anna, he knows.

00:57:25.779 --> 00:57:26.862
What, what, what?

00:57:26.863 --> 00:57:28.947
He knows what we're doing,
he knows what this is.

00:57:28.948 --> 00:57:30.324
He knows what this is.

00:57:30.325 --> 00:57:33.285
I don't wanna... No,
I don't wanna join.

00:57:33.286 --> 00:57:36.738
I don't wanna join up.

00:57:51.721 --> 00:57:53.847
Suppertime, you lazy prick.

00:57:53.848 --> 00:57:56.466
(SNORING)

00:57:58.228 --> 00:58:00.854
Goddamn waste of lungs.

00:58:00.855 --> 00:58:03.056

For my own reasons, but, yeah.

01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:17.786
Oh, I like you even more now.

01:07:17.787 --> 01:07:20.456
There is something about
connecting over mutual hatred

01:07:20.457 --> 01:07:22.291
that's just so much
deeper than mutual love.

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:23.417
It's true, right?

01:07:23.418 --> 01:07:26.253
If two people hate the same
things, it creates a bond.

01:07:26.254 --> 01:07:27.463

01:07:55.367 --> 01:07:56.658
- He's smiling.
- Yeah.

01:07:56.659 --> 01:07:58.035
No, in the picture, he's smiling!

01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:01.246
I bought that off a peddler who was
coming through town last week.

01:08:01.247 --> 01:08:03.248
- This is the guy I was telling you about.
- Uh-huh.

01:08:03.249 --> 01:08:04.500
I didn't even know this existed.

01:08:04.501 --> 01:08:06.794
- And apparently, he's not insane.
- Bullshit!

That's what the guy told me.

01:08:07.962 --> 01:08:10.172
It takes 30 seconds
to take a photograph.

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:11.590
This guy would have
had to sit there

01:08:11.591 --> 01:08:13.384
and smile for 30 sustained seconds.

01:08:13.385 --> 01:08:15.928
I know. I've never been happy for
30 seconds in a row in my life.

01:08:15.929 --> 01:08:18.347

anything like this for me.

01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:48.050
I've missed you, baby.
Oh, I've missed you a lot.

01:22:48.051 --> 01:22:49.218
(COUGHS)

01:22:49.219 --> 01:22:53.347
The longer the ride,
the lonelier a man gets.

01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:56.016
And he needs the comforting touch

01:22:56.017 --> 01:23:00.229
of the woman he loves to
soothe his tired bones.

01:23:00.230 --> 01:23:02.231
And now, I'm here,

01:23:02.232 --> 01:23:03.899
you're here,

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:06.860
and we have time to
be husband and wife.

01:23:06.861 --> 01:23:08.070
The proper way.

01:23:08.071 --> 01:23:09.571
Hey, asshole.

01:23:22.627 --> 01:23:25.787
I can't leave him like that.

01:23:35.598 --> 01:23:37.799
That's better.

01:24:14.846 --> 01:24:16.305
Albert!

01:24:16.306 --> 01:24:17.765
Albert, you gotta get out of here.

01:24:17.766 --> 01:24:19.683
Yeah, that's... That's
what I'm doing.

01:24:19.684 --> 01:24:21.310
No, no, no. Like, right now.

01:24:21.311 --> 01:24:22.770
Clinch is gonna be looking for you.

01:24:22.771 --> 01:24:24.438
Yeah, I'm leaving.

01:24:24.439 --> 01:24:26.065
Uh, I'm going to San Francisco.

01:24:26.066 --> 01:24:29.985
Just what I should
have done a week ago.

01:24:29.986 --> 01:24:31.195
I'm so sorry.

01:24:31.196 --> 01:24:33.447
Yeah, well, you know, so am I.

01:24:33.448 --> 01:24:35.115
What about your dad?

01:24:35.116 --> 01:24:37.743
I asked him if he wanted
to come, and he said no.

01:24:37.744 --> 01:24:41.196
He's up on the hill, burying
himself next to Mom.

01:24:42.374 --> 01:24:43.749
Look, I never meant to mislead...

01:24:43.750 --> 01:24:44.833
Okay, you know what, Anna?

01:24:44.834 --> 01:24:46.710
Don't even waste my time, okay?

01:24:46.711 --> 01:24:47.836
Don't even waste my time.

01:24:47.837 --> 01:24:51.507
You had a million opportunities to
tell me, and you just fucking lied.

01:24:51.508 --> 01:24:52.633
I didn't lie.

01:24:52.634 --> 01:24:53.759
What would you call it?

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.012
You're married to the most
vicious killer in the territory.

01:24:57.013 --> 01:24:59.723
You don't think maybe that's
something you should have told me?

01:24:59.724 --> 01:25:02.017
I didn't tell you because I
was trying to protect you.

01:25:02.018 --> 01:25:04.353
Oh, bullshit! You were looking
out for your own self-interest.

01:25:04.354 --> 01:25:07.231
And because I liked you.

01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:10.192
I didn't want to scare you away.

01:25:10.193 --> 01:25:12.736
I never thought I'd meet
someone like you, Albert.

01:25:12.737 --> 01:25:14.905
What, somebody who hasn't killed
people? Somebody like that?

01:25:14.906 --> 01:25:16.198
Yeah, that's really hard to find.

01:25:16.199 --> 01:25:17.366
That's why women are always going,

01:25:17.367 --> 01:25:20.536
"Oh, my God. Why are all
the non-murderers taken?"

01:25:20.537 --> 01:25:22.204
Hey. It's not my fault, all right?

01:25:22.205 --> 01:25:24.039
We were married when I was nine.

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:26.125
Nine? (SCOFFS)

01:25:26.126 --> 01:25:28.085
How does that even work?
Was there a ceremony?

01:25:28.086 --> 01:25:29.211
Yeah, of course there was a...

01:25:29.212 --> 01:25:31.547
My parents were there,
and a couple of neighbors.

01:25:31.548 --> 01:25:33.007
I just didn't want to end
up like one of those

01:25:33.008 --> 01:25:35.968
15-year-old spinsters, you know?

01:25:35.969 --> 01:25:38.053
You know, I don't even know...

01:25:38.054 --> 01:25:40.639
I don't even know
why I'm surprised.

01:25:40.640 --> 01:25:43.892
Every girl that I ever fall in love
with ends up disappointing me.

01:25:43.893 --> 01:25:47.596
And every time, I'm surprised.

01:25:49.315 --> 01:25:50.649
You love me?

01:25:50.650 --> 01:25:52.985
Oh, you know what?
I'm over it. You can go.

01:25:52.986 --> 01:25:54.611
All right. I lied, fine.

01:25:54.612 --> 01:25:56.905
What was I supposed
to say, Albert? Tell me.

01:25:56.906 --> 01:25:58.657
Was I supposed to go,
"Oh hi, I'm Anna!

01:25:58.658 --> 01:26:00.325
"I've been fucking a
killer since I was 10"?

01:26:00.326 --> 01:26:02.286
Oh, he waited a year?
What a gentleman.

01:26:02.287 --> 01:26:03.787
Well, late nine. I rounded it up.

01:26:03.788 --> 01:26:05.205
It doesn't matter.
I'm done with him.

01:26:05.206 --> 01:26:08.667
I knocked him out, and I stuck
a daisy in his asshole.

01:26:08.668 --> 01:26:10.419
You what?

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.172
That's how much you mean to me.

01:26:13.173 --> 01:26:15.749
You know,

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:21.255
I loved a girl who
doesn't even exist.

01:26:21.431 --> 01:26:24.475
Is your name even Anna? Huh?

01:26:24.476 --> 01:26:26.602
Or is it something
terrible, like Gwendolyn?

01:26:26.603 --> 01:26:31.857
My name is Anna. I'm that
same girl you fell in love with.

01:26:31.858 --> 01:26:34.643
That was the real me.

01:26:34.861 --> 01:26:39.073
Possibly for the first
time in my entire life.

01:26:39.074 --> 01:26:40.866
I just didn't think I
deserved a good guy.

01:26:40.867 --> 01:26:44.111
But you know what? I do.

01:26:46.873 --> 01:26:49.449

01:48:25.388 --> 01:48:27.256
I know, right? "No! Oh, my God!"

01:48:27.257 --> 01:48:30.459
- No, we're fine. We're okay.
- LOUISE: Albert!

01:48:30.593 --> 01:48:31.969
Hey, Louise.

01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:35.764
Hey. Listen, if you want to...

01:48:35.765 --> 01:48:39.810
If you want to talk about
things, I would like that.

01:48:39.811 --> 01:48:44.640
I mean, I could come by your
place, like, later tonight.

01:48:45.275 --> 01:48:46.942
You know, uh, Louise, I would,

01:48:46.943 --> 01:48:51.647
but I really gotta go
home and work on myself.

01:48:55.618 --> 01:48:57.745
ANNA:
So, you killed Clinch Leatherwood,

01:48:57.746 --> 01:49:00.289
the deadliest gunman
on the frontier.

01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:02.333
Yeah, I guess I did, huh?

01:49:02.334 --> 01:49:03.459
(BARKS)

01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:06.128
ANNA: You know, there's probably
gonna be some reward money.

01:49:06.129 --> 01:49:08.964
ALBERT: You know,
I didn't think about that.

01:49:08.965 --> 01:49:12.084
ANNA: What are you gonna do?

01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:46.210
Step right up, folks.
Step right up!

01:49:46.211 --> 01:49:49.713
Who wants to take a gander
at the shooting gallery?

01:49:49.714 --> 01:49:52.541
DJANGO: I'll take a shot.

01:49:57.722 --> 01:50:00.015
(CROWD GASPS)

01:50:00.016 --> 01:50:01.975
People die at the fair.

01:50:01.976 --> 01:50:04.803
(COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING)

01:55:38.355 --> 01:55:43.164
DJANGO: What the fuck? Somebody
bring me one of them white women.
