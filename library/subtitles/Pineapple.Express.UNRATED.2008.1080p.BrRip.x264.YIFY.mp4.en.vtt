WEBVTT

01:00:00.056 --> 01:00:02.057


01:00:02.225 --> 01:00:04.935
And then he said

01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:07.479
...filled with all these

01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:10.899
A powdered wig,

01:00:11.067 --> 01:00:12.943
I mean, What the fuck

01:00:13.111 --> 01:00:15.612
Why don't I just call the Asians

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.073
Why beat around the bush,

01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:30.711


01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:31.920


01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:33.381


01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:37.760
Ted, what a surprise.

01:00:37.928 --> 01:00:41.931
Well, Cheung, my friend,

01:00:42.099 --> 01:00:46.018
You know, we both know

01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:50.187
...hit men over here last night,

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.525
...made a little decoration

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:57.070
We painted the wall with his brain.

01:00:57.238 --> 01:01:00.907
And nowthis Dale Denton guy?

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:04.661
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.079
- What?

01:01:06.247 --> 01:01:07.664
- Hello?

01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:12.420
Dad! Get off the phone. I told you

01:01:12.588 --> 01:01:15.089
...and this is the time.

01:01:15.257 --> 01:01:17.508
...so you would stay off mine.

01:01:17.676 --> 01:01:21.136
Don't talk to me like that.

01:01:21.304 --> 01:01:24.723
And from this point forward, I'm

01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:29.186
I love you, Dad, but the dynamic

01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:31.605
Troy, do me a favor,

01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:35.317
- Shit.

01:01:35.485 --> 01:01:37.486


01:01:37.653 --> 01:01:40.447
All right, you listen to me, Cheung,

01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:43.075
It is on! We're coming at you

01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:45.786
It's on, so you better get your head

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.621


01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:49.664


01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:51.918


01:01:52.086 --> 01:01:55.587
Do you have any idea

01:01:57.048 --> 01:02:00.133


01:02:00.468 --> 01:02:01.802


01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.513


01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.308


01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:12.230
Your brother's death

01:02:14.775 --> 01:02:18.403
I gotta say, I've had, like,

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.154
You're the coolest I've ever had.

01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:23.824
- Really? Thanks, man.

01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:26.451
I really appreciate it.

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:30.414
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:34.501
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen

01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:37.671
I'm totally glad

01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:40.382


01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:45.679
We should get out of town.

01:02:45.847 --> 01:02:47.514


01:02:48.391 --> 01:02:49.683


01:02:49.851 --> 01:02:53.312
Go to the next town.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.731
You know what I was saying?

01:02:55.899 --> 01:02:57.859
You're glad you dipped your pen

01:02:58.026 --> 01:03:00.194
But We should get bus tickets

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:01.571


01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:04.865
Get on the bus? Leave?

01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:08.368
I only have, like, 50 bucks.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.245


01:03:10.413 --> 01:03:13.290
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.419
No. That's unfortunate,

01:03:17.587 --> 01:03:19.045


01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:21.298
Couldn't we just,

01:03:21.466 --> 01:03:23.133
...get some cash

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:27.345
- Of course, man. That's what I do.

01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:30.308
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets

01:03:30.476 --> 01:03:32.059


01:03:32.561 --> 01:03:33.936


01:03:34.104 --> 01:03:36.271


01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:44.571


01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:46.740
Pineapple Express.

01:03:46.908 --> 01:03:50.119
- Yeah, but don't call it that.

01:03:50.287 --> 01:03:53.164
- Call it Banana Boat.

01:03:53.332 --> 01:03:56.250
This can be a gateway drug.

01:03:56.418 --> 01:03:58.919
- Cocaine. Don't do that.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:03.131
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:04.716


01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.694
- How much money you guys gotu

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:27.239
You each get as much

01:04:27.407 --> 01:04:29.700
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.

01:04:29.868 --> 01:04:33.538
- Keep it on the down-low.

01:04:33.705 --> 01:04:37.875
You got it from Saul... I mean, you got

01:04:38.043 --> 01:04:40.878
- Go. Come on.

01:04:42.964 --> 01:04:44.047


01:04:44.215 --> 01:04:46.882
You are a good salesman.

01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:49.469
I'm about to go get some

01:04:49.637 --> 01:04:51.137


01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:53.306
Something to drink too.

01:04:53.474 --> 01:04:55.892


01:05:02.108 --> 01:05:05.485
Don't move. Don't you move.

01:05:05.653 --> 01:05:07.280


01:05:07.447 --> 01:05:09.198


01:05:09.366 --> 01:05:11.075
- Right here.

01:05:11.243 --> 01:05:13.786
I thought it was decriminalized,

01:05:13.954 --> 01:05:18.206
I have horrible anorexia,

01:05:18.374 --> 01:05:23.169
Look, selling narcotics to my students

01:05:23.337 --> 01:05:26.340
- Okay. I understand.

01:05:26.508 --> 01:05:29.594
And guess what? I just saw three

01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:33.096
...with their eyes as red

01:05:39.312 --> 01:05:41.187
- On the hood. On the hood.

01:05:41.355 --> 01:05:43.064


01:05:43.232 --> 01:05:46.027
- Stand still. Stand still.

01:05:46.194 --> 01:05:49.904
You better hope it's clean.

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:52.907
I'm gonna put my foot

01:05:56.579 --> 01:05:59.039


01:06:01.334 --> 01:06:04.836
This is Ofticer Barbara. Requesting

01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:09.550
I repeat, requesting update on Dale

01:06:09.718 --> 01:06:11.719


01:06:13.263 --> 01:06:14.555


01:06:14.723 --> 01:06:16.807
What? What do you mean...?

01:06:16.975 --> 01:06:19.226
What did that thing tell you?

01:06:19.394 --> 01:06:21.645
What did I tell you?

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:24.313
I wasn't doing things.

01:06:24.482 --> 01:06:26.900
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.

01:06:27.068 --> 01:06:28.568


01:06:28.736 --> 01:06:30.779
One of them Was actually

01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:33.823
You gotta be the dumbest

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:36.868
It's the lady cop.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.912
So you're telling me

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.872
...and a police officer

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.540
- Exactly.

01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:44.710
- Yes, do you believe me?

01:06:44.878 --> 01:06:47.713
- It was a Woman or a man?

01:06:47.881 --> 01:06:52.760
- I think I know who that bitch Was.

01:06:54.721 --> 01:06:57.138
Thank you so much for believing me,

01:06:57.306 --> 01:06:59.391


01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:01.810
I'll take this badge off,

01:07:01.977 --> 01:07:04.146
I don't work for the law.

01:07:04.314 --> 01:07:06.440
I been smelling something

01:07:06.608 --> 01:07:07.942


01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:10.360
- Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:12.946


01:07:13.114 --> 01:07:16.950
Oh, no. What the hell was that?

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:26.711


01:07:26.878 --> 01:07:29.880
- No. What are you doing?

01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:33.299
Freeze, goddamn it!

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:36.052
This is an old-fashioned

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.012


01:07:41.642 --> 01:07:44.145
- What the fuck are you doing?

01:07:44.312 --> 01:07:45.730


01:07:48.316 --> 01:07:51.318
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop!

01:07:51.486 --> 01:07:53.070
- That's the lady cop.

01:07:53.238 --> 01:07:56.282


01:08:02.205 --> 01:08:04.164


01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:05.665


01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:12.172


01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.509


01:08:16.677 --> 01:08:18.845
- Turn on the Wipers!

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:20.680


01:08:20.848 --> 01:08:23.601
- How do you drive with one foot?

01:08:25.604 --> 01:08:27.480


01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:32.193


01:08:32.903 --> 01:08:35.029
She's gaining on us.

01:08:35.197 --> 01:08:36.238


01:08:36.406 --> 01:08:38.823
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.

01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:41.869


01:08:44.372 --> 01:08:46.456


01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:49.793


01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.669


01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:55.715


01:09:01.056 --> 01:09:05.476
Danger! Danger!

01:09:08.396 --> 01:09:09.980
Hey, I can see

01:09:10.148 --> 01:09:11.898


01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:16.528


01:09:17.822 --> 01:09:19.322


01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.575


01:09:21.743 --> 01:09:24.161


01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:34.254


01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:36.756
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.

01:09:36.924 --> 01:09:39.175


01:09:42.681 --> 01:09:46.015


01:09:46.934 --> 01:09:48.434


01:09:49.728 --> 01:09:51.312


01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.731
Fuck. I'm sorry.

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.775
- Why?

01:10:12.794 --> 01:10:14.295


01:10:18.759 --> 01:10:21.176
Yes! Yes! We made it!

01:10:21.344 --> 01:10:24.012
- Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.973
You forgot me, you idiot!

01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:30.018


01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:31.520
- Sorry, man.

01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:35.649
- Let's go.

01:10:39.321 --> 01:10:40.780


01:10:40.948 --> 01:10:44.867
Angie, you have exhibited

01:10:45.035 --> 01:10:46.035


01:10:46.203 --> 01:10:48.955
And we have hosted violence

01:10:49.123 --> 01:10:51.082
- "Hosted violence"?

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:53.875
You don't see that

01:10:54.043 --> 01:10:56.962
- You lowered your expectations...

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:00.049
...but this guy is so far beneath you.

01:11:00.217 --> 01:11:02.218
Open your heart

01:11:02.386 --> 01:11:04.429
Or don't have a boyfriend

01:11:04.596 --> 01:11:06.389
- We're stuck in this room.

01:11:06.557 --> 01:11:08.182
- It's not your decision.

01:11:08.349 --> 01:11:11.017
- You don't know What love is.

01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:13.395
- We're going to the police.

01:11:13.563 --> 01:11:15.730
- I know.

01:11:15.898 --> 01:11:18.317
- You should listen. He's a lawyer.

01:11:18.485 --> 01:11:21.070
- He can't possibly work in law.

01:11:21.238 --> 01:11:22.405
- You stay.

01:11:22.573 --> 01:11:24.657
- You stay in the room.

01:11:24.825 --> 01:11:27.576
And we don't need the shampoos.

01:11:29.745 --> 01:11:32.998
As soon as we kill

01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:34.916


01:11:39.173 --> 01:11:40.756


01:11:40.924 --> 01:11:42.508


01:11:43.302 --> 01:11:46.762
And I promise you

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:48.222


01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:50.183
For now, this is what

01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:53.853
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,

01:11:54.021 --> 01:11:56.606
Then tomorrow morning,

01:11:56.773 --> 01:11:59.274
Dale, Saul, the Asians.

01:11:59.442 --> 01:12:01.610


01:12:02.111 --> 01:12:03.820


01:12:03.988 --> 01:12:05.572


01:12:07.992 --> 01:12:12.329
Say something in Spanish.

01:12:13.705 --> 01:12:15.498


01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:16.749
- Days Inn.

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.793
May I have the Garagely room,

01:12:19.628 --> 01:12:21.546
- Hello?

01:12:21.714 --> 01:12:23.548
- Dale.

01:12:23.716 --> 01:12:26.426
- My God, are you okay?

01:12:26.593 --> 01:12:27.927
- Are you okay?

01:12:28.095 --> 01:12:29.679


01:12:29.847 --> 01:12:32.015
It might sound weird at first,

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:35.059
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...

01:12:35.227 --> 01:12:40.148
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:43.192
I can't believe I'm in this situation

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.236
...and your addiction to marijuana.

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:47.946


01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:51.283
A, I use a bong. It filters out

01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:54.327
B, what does that have to do with

01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:55.788


01:12:55.956 --> 01:12:58.458
This, that's happening between us,

01:12:58.625 --> 01:13:01.127
This happens to every couple

01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:02.795
- We have to work through it.

01:13:02.963 --> 01:13:04.422


01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.049
I should not be in this situation,

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.550


01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.219


01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.724
Congratulations. Sad to happen

01:13:14.892 --> 01:13:16.225


01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:19.062
It means that you are gonna go

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:21.314
You'll get into

01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:22.648


01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:25.401
And you'll blow a bunch of dudes

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:28.279
...and I'll be here in fucking

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:30.865
You're gonna dump me.

01:13:31.033 --> 01:13:33.116


01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.036
You never did like me anyway,

01:13:35.204 --> 01:13:36.746


01:13:36.914 --> 01:13:39.498
I always cared about you.

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:40.916


01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.918


01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.504
Why do you never act

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:49.800
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.010


01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:57.433
You lost it playing Bid Whist?

01:13:57.601 --> 01:14:00.812
No, I'll give you more,

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.689


01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:07.985
I couldn't remember if it was today

01:14:08.153 --> 01:14:09.695


01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:12.031


01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:15.618
Hey, you all right, man?

01:14:15.786 --> 01:14:18.204
I'm okay.

01:14:18.372 --> 01:14:19.455


01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:24.835
- Don't do that, okay?

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.170


01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:28.797


01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.299
...because we were smoking

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.469
No, man. It happened

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:35.805
...couldn't keep their shit

01:14:35.973 --> 01:14:38.808
In case you haven't noticed...

01:14:38.976 --> 01:14:41.477
From what I can tell,

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:44.981
- We are not very functional when

01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:47.899
Well, I don't know, man.

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:50.902
I was, like, stoned when I saved you

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.488


01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:55.241
Well, that would be true

01:14:55.409 --> 01:14:56.534


01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:58.619
She was gonna help,

01:14:58.787 --> 01:15:00.663
We're wanted

01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:02.832
Don't fucking get on my case,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.667


01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:07.420
...is so I could put my bubbe

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:09.754
- She must be proud of you.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.257


01:15:11.425 --> 01:15:13.968
As soon as she dies,

01:15:14.136 --> 01:15:16.470
I'm gonna design septic tanks

01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:18.139


01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:19.931


01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.184
What am I gonna do?

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.936
...for fear that you've designed

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:28.315
I'm gonna be on the radio,

01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:30.902
- Giving lessons about life.

01:15:31.069 --> 01:15:33.571
I'm gonna be designing buildings

01:15:33.739 --> 01:15:35.573


01:15:35.741 --> 01:15:39.368
You are an asshole.

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:41.370
- I'm not an asshole.

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:44.540
I feel pretty sure

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:46.334


01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:49.003
I'm just as nice as you are.

01:15:49.171 --> 01:15:50.964


01:15:51.132 --> 01:15:53.467


01:15:53.926 --> 01:15:57.219
Now about in the park

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.054


01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.765
Well, that's easy.

01:16:01.933 --> 01:16:03.391


01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.310
There's one reason

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:07.520


01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:10.900
If you didn't sell those drugs,

01:16:11.068 --> 01:16:14.237
...and I would be fantastic right now.

01:16:16.198 --> 01:16:19.200
That sounded mean.

01:16:19.368 --> 01:16:20.910
- I didn't mean to say...

01:16:21.078 --> 01:16:23.537


01:16:23.705 --> 01:16:25.748
What? That's not even

01:16:25.916 --> 01:16:28.625
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:30.670


01:16:31.129 --> 01:16:34.632
- What are you doing?

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.385


01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:39.637


01:16:39.805 --> 01:16:42.223


01:16:42.391 --> 01:16:44.599


01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.782


01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.409


01:17:52.044 --> 01:17:53.502


01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:55.880


01:17:56.048 --> 01:17:57.423


01:17:57.591 --> 01:18:02.470
Angie, I'm calling because I love you

01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:06.057
...and I wanna let you know

01:18:06.224 --> 01:18:07.975


01:18:08.143 --> 01:18:11.729
I've had a near-death experience,

01:18:11.897 --> 01:18:14.607
...you can prioritize your life,

01:18:14.775 --> 01:18:16.942
So please

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:19.195
- I love you.

01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:23.531
- Yeah?

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:27.161
We were driving away from the house

01:18:27.329 --> 01:18:28.537


01:18:28.705 --> 01:18:30.122


01:18:33.210 --> 01:18:34.877


01:18:35.045 --> 01:18:37.380
- What do you mean?

01:18:37.798 --> 01:18:40.216
- What?

01:18:40.384 --> 01:18:42.967
- You wanna... Oh, fuck.

01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:44.719


01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.014
I realize now

01:18:47.182 --> 01:18:49.100
...then you are very naive

01:18:49.267 --> 01:18:52.853
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.

01:18:53.021 --> 01:18:56.148
- You're the one that's immature.

01:18:56.316 --> 01:18:59.527
I am somewhat immature,

01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:00.986


01:19:01.154 --> 01:19:03.697
I lost my virginity

01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:06.034
- Really?

01:19:06.202 --> 01:19:08.285
- Like, two and a half.

01:19:08.453 --> 01:19:09.662


01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:12.748
No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:15.583
I remember thinking,

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:18.128
If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.

01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:19.629


01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:20.964


01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:24.217
I will, and that's the last

01:19:26.388 --> 01:19:30.182


01:19:33.395 --> 01:19:35.688


01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:38.441


01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:40.443


01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.362
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:46.741
Your grandson. We need you to get

01:19:46.909 --> 01:19:48.826
What are you talking about,

01:19:48.994 --> 01:19:51.745
You told me you wanna sit down,

01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:53.914
And nowyou're hocking me

01:19:54.082 --> 01:19:56.749
- Is that Yiddish?

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.042


01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.337
You can call me Faye,

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:03.047


01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:04.758


01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:06.302


01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:08.971
- Well, look who it is.

01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:14.101


01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.353


01:20:16.521 --> 01:20:18.147


01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:24.904


01:20:25.071 --> 01:20:26.989


01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:30.159
...they sat down with me

01:20:30.327 --> 01:20:32.411


01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:35.748
And they kept asking questions

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:40.377
- What did they look like?

01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:44.340
And the other guy,

01:20:44.508 --> 01:20:45.841


01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:47.927


01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:52.473
...that my grandson came in,

01:20:52.641 --> 01:20:54.642
- You gotta find my grandson.

01:20:54.809 --> 01:20:56.059
- Do you promise?

01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:58.102
Absolutely.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.812


01:21:05.487 --> 01:21:08.697
You sack of shit. Do you know

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:10.616


01:21:10.784 --> 01:21:13.619
Who gave you that lollipop?

01:21:13.787 --> 01:21:15.996


01:21:16.164 --> 01:21:19.625
You guys started it, man.

01:21:19.793 --> 01:21:21.126


01:21:22.797 --> 01:21:25.799


01:21:26.425 --> 01:21:28.301


01:21:28.469 --> 01:21:31.178
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.

01:21:31.346 --> 01:21:32.679


01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:34.847
I should be kicking

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:38.393
- If anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:39.602


01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.981
Like someone fucked you up

01:21:42.148 --> 01:21:43.899


01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:46.193
- Professional on this, bitch.

01:21:46.361 --> 01:21:48.487
- Where were you?

01:21:48.655 --> 01:21:50.531
- Supposed to be my partner.

01:21:50.699 --> 01:21:52.366
No, you wasn't.

01:21:52.534 --> 01:21:54.743
I take the hit?

01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:57.288
Fuck all this, you know?

01:21:57.455 --> 01:22:00.709
Take him downstairs.

01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:03.043


01:22:03.211 --> 01:22:06.171
What's down there?

01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:07.965


01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:10.217


01:22:10.594 --> 01:22:13.512
And you hurt damn near

01:22:14.556 --> 01:22:16.265


01:22:16.725 --> 01:22:18.601
- You know you gonna die, right?

01:22:18.768 --> 01:22:20.811


01:22:20.979 --> 01:22:24.273
I hope you enjoy these last

01:22:24.441 --> 01:22:26.692
...because when Ted gets here,

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.945
"Kill that motherfucker."

01:22:30.113 --> 01:22:31.113


01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:34.867


01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:37.952


01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.456


01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:43.000


01:22:43.627 --> 01:22:45.794


01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:47.713


01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:50.257
- Come on.

01:22:50.425 --> 01:22:52.217


01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:53.719


01:23:00.895 --> 01:23:03.521
It's the most beautiful thing

01:23:03.689 --> 01:23:05.357
- What kind of irrigation...?

01:23:05.524 --> 01:23:07.441
- Can I touch it?

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:24.625


01:23:24.793 --> 01:23:26.168


01:23:32.342 --> 01:23:34.259
- Red?

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:37.221
Get out of here, man.

01:23:37.389 --> 01:23:40.517
Look, I come in peace, okay?

01:23:40.685 --> 01:23:42.102


01:23:42.269 --> 01:23:45.020
Because I'm tired, man.

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.022


01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:48.732


01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.192


01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.694
- Yeah?

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:53.696
And then they got me again

01:23:53.863 --> 01:23:57.073


01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:58.784


01:23:58.952 --> 01:24:00.869
- You don't need to die.

01:24:01.037 --> 01:24:03.664
You don't get it.

01:24:03.832 --> 01:24:06.083


01:24:06.251 --> 01:24:08.377
...Ted's gonna find me, man.

01:24:08.545 --> 01:24:11.463
And when he does,

01:24:11.631 --> 01:24:13.257


01:24:13.425 --> 01:24:16.385
I couldn't agree more, Red.

01:24:16.553 --> 01:24:18.387


01:24:18.555 --> 01:24:19.930


01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:22.099


01:24:22.267 --> 01:24:25.394
We've been on the run together.

01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:28.397
He is. I'll tell you that, man.

01:24:28.565 --> 01:24:29.648


01:24:29.816 --> 01:24:32.568
I wronged him and I can't...

01:24:32.736 --> 01:24:36.405
I'm just into Buddhism

01:24:36.573 --> 01:24:40.452
...that me as this person,

01:24:40.619 --> 01:24:42.579


01:24:42.747 --> 01:24:46.707
And it's a shell, and it's like

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:51.002
And that's what I am. It's like

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:53.546
Except, if you're a dick

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:56.592
...your next shell

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.511
If you're an asshole, you're gonna

01:24:59.679 --> 01:25:03.432
Or a Worm,

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.976
If you're a man,

01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:07.728


01:25:07.896 --> 01:25:09.438


01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:11.273


01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:14.276


01:25:14.444 --> 01:25:17.781
Maybe the anal bead. Might...

01:25:17.948 --> 01:25:18.990


01:25:19.158 --> 01:25:20.617
- Then the dragon.

01:25:20.785 --> 01:25:24.620
You need to help me, okay?

01:25:24.788 --> 01:25:25.996


01:25:26.164 --> 01:25:28.582
Let's get up

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:31.417
- Aren't you angry at Ted?

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:34.754
What do you wanna do? Don't you

01:25:34.922 --> 01:25:37.216
Maybe that would be cool

01:25:37.383 --> 01:25:39.051


01:25:39.219 --> 01:25:41.512
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna

01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:43.472


01:25:45.099 --> 01:25:46.475


01:25:49.646 --> 01:25:53.357
Ted Jones messed

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.903


01:26:03.868 --> 01:26:05.118


01:26:05.286 --> 01:26:07.996
Get those. I don't wanna

01:26:08.164 --> 01:26:10.249
...and shoot my face off, okay?

01:26:17.216 --> 01:26:19.925
I used to use this little gun

01:26:24.931 --> 01:26:28.016


01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:29.852


01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:31.519
- Don't.

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:33.856
- Don't. You stop it right now.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.954


01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:53.710


01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:57.672
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.800
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.

01:27:00.968 --> 01:27:03.887
What? I thought we just got all

01:27:04.054 --> 01:27:06.471
Ted is a fucking murderer.

01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:08.723
I got a wife.

01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:11.809
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.146
Oh, man, no.

01:27:14.314 --> 01:27:16.690
Come on. This could be

01:27:16.858 --> 01:27:18.066


01:27:18.234 --> 01:27:20.777
I don't want a moment.

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:21.987


01:27:22.155 --> 01:27:24.323
Please come back for me.

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:28.702
Legends never die, dude.

01:27:29.412 --> 01:27:32.248


01:27:32.416 --> 01:27:36.377
Carol used to be a little crazy, man.

01:27:36.545 --> 01:27:38.837
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.

01:27:39.005 --> 01:27:41.423
Game over, motherfuckers!

01:27:41.591 --> 01:27:43.884
Tell me where my friend is

01:27:44.052 --> 01:27:46.261
All right, everybody be cool, man.

01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:47.971
Put your guns down.

01:27:48.139 --> 01:27:49.765


01:27:49.933 --> 01:27:52.268


01:27:52.436 --> 01:27:54.354


01:27:54.521 --> 01:27:56.188
- You shot him.

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.899
- Drop the fucking gun.

01:27:59.067 --> 01:28:01.360
- Holy shit.

01:28:01.527 --> 01:28:03.320


01:28:03.488 --> 01:28:06.239
I shot him. I don't have time

01:28:06.407 --> 01:28:08.909
Now, I wanna finish this off

01:28:09.077 --> 01:28:10.994
...and have dinner

01:28:11.163 --> 01:28:13.288


01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:15.290


01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:17.459


01:28:17.627 --> 01:28:19.419
- If you do...

01:28:19.587 --> 01:28:21.171
- Motherfucker.

01:28:21.339 --> 01:28:23.006


01:28:23.174 --> 01:28:24.800


01:28:24.968 --> 01:28:27.219
There's one more.

01:28:27.387 --> 01:28:29.554
I'm sorry, guys.

01:28:29.722 --> 01:28:30.974


01:28:34.019 --> 01:28:36.479
- Oh, great.

01:28:36.647 --> 01:28:37.772
- Dale.

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:41.109
What did you do, rat me out?

01:28:41.276 --> 01:28:43.151
- No, man.

01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:44.987


01:28:45.154 --> 01:28:47.822


01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:50.367
And I'm gonna die in here

01:28:50.535 --> 01:28:52.619
Okay, you know what?

01:28:52.787 --> 01:28:55.622
I'll take that because

01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:58.959
This whole thing is my fault.

01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:02.337


01:29:02.505 --> 01:29:04.923
...to make that up to you

01:29:05.091 --> 01:29:08.176
So that's What I came here to do.

01:29:08.344 --> 01:29:10.847
Because that's what you are.

01:29:11.015 --> 01:29:12.765


01:29:12.933 --> 01:29:15.893
I was mean.

01:29:16.061 --> 01:29:18.312
I didn't Want

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.189
I didn't Wanna think

01:29:21.357 --> 01:29:23.817
Now I realize I'm lucky

01:29:23.985 --> 01:29:25.485

- I know. They are.

01:29:48.176 --> 01:29:52.512
We can hear you outside and

01:31:24.230 --> 01:31:26.774


01:31:26.942 --> 01:31:30.236
Who is he? Where did he come from?

01:32:23.497 --> 01:32:25.333

One cough mean you go.

01:32:28.378 --> 01:32:30.880
The belt buckle.

01:32:31.048 --> 01:32:33.299

01:34:11.064 --> 01:34:13.149
- He got your ear, man.

01:34:13.317 --> 01:34:16.027
- He got your ear.

01:34:17.154 --> 01:34:18.820


01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:22.574
- Help!

01:34:22.742 --> 01:34:23.783
- Yeah.

01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:26.036
- You killed my ear.

01:34:26.203 --> 01:34:28.121
- I didn't do that.

01:34:28.289 --> 01:34:29.331


01:34:29.498 --> 01:34:31.708
- Get your hands off of me.

01:34:31.876 --> 01:34:33.501


01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:34.919


01:34:35.087 --> 01:34:36.463


01:34:36.630 --> 01:34:38.631


01:34:38.799 --> 01:34:41.176


01:35:15.711 --> 01:35:17.379


01:35:18.297 --> 01:35:20.633


01:35:20.801 --> 01:35:22.385


01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:36.231


01:35:44.408 --> 01:35:47.243
So seriously,

01:35:47.411 --> 01:35:50.746
Is it really disgusting

01:35:53.125 --> 01:35:55.083


01:35:55.251 --> 01:35:57.752
Don't worry, bro.

01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.962

01:36:51.974 --> 01:36:53.975


01:36:54.143 --> 01:36:55.852


01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:57.980


01:36:58.148 --> 01:36:59.315


01:36:59.483 --> 01:37:02.651
Watch my back.

01:37:07.157 --> 01:37:08.990


01:37:27.636 --> 01:37:30.012
No, no, there might be

01:37:55.579 --> 01:37:57.373
- Give it to me.

01:37:57.541 --> 01:38:00.000
- Be taller.

01:38:00.168 --> 01:38:02.169
- Pull harder.

01:38:02.337 --> 01:38:05.047


01:38:05.215 --> 01:38:08.050
- I'm jumping as high as I can.

01:38:10.971 --> 01:38:12.012


01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:13.722


01:38:15.517 --> 01:38:18.726
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit.

01:39:46.399 --> 01:39:48.233


01:39:48.401 --> 01:39:49.610


01:40:10.923 --> 01:40:14.259
You and me, baby.

01:40:14.427 --> 01:40:15.594


01:40:30.526 --> 01:40:31.651


01:40:36.783 --> 01:40:39.702


01:41:00.223 --> 01:41:02.558


01:41:04.977 --> 01:41:07.520
- Why you doing this to me?

01:41:08.605 --> 01:41:10.106


01:41:10.274 --> 01:41:11.483


01:41:18.825 --> 01:41:20.743


01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:23.203


01:41:30.127 --> 01:41:33.046
Come on, bitch.

01:41:33.214 --> 01:41:35.174


01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:44.223


01:41:51.608 --> 01:41:53.150


01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:03.952


01:42:06.623 --> 01:42:08.957
- You killed...

01:42:10.044 --> 01:42:11.960


01:42:18.509 --> 01:42:20.092


01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.595


01:42:24.348 --> 01:42:26.724


01:42:29.854 --> 01:42:31.647


01:42:31.815 --> 01:42:33.732


01:42:37.654 --> 01:42:39.321


01:42:40.907 --> 01:42:42.574


01:42:45.327 --> 01:42:47.078


01:42:47.246 --> 01:42:50.332
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.584


01:42:54.796 --> 01:42:58.340
- Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers.

01:42:58.508 --> 01:42:59.967


01:43:00.593 --> 01:43:04.388
- Look, I didn't Wanna hit you, man...

01:43:04.556 --> 01:43:09.059
You think you was gonna

01:43:09.227 --> 01:43:11.854
You need to sit

01:43:12.021 --> 01:43:14.147


01:43:14.315 --> 01:43:15.732


01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.984
You know what?

01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:21.737


01:43:37.881 --> 01:43:42.009
You just got killed by a

01:43:42.176 --> 01:43:43.677


01:43:45.013 --> 01:43:46.179


01:43:46.347 --> 01:43:47.390


01:43:47.851 --> 01:43:49.018


01:43:49.186 --> 01:43:52.062


01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:53.896
- Yeah.

01:43:54.731 --> 01:43:56.232


01:43:56.942 --> 01:43:59.902
- You lied to me.

01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:04.531
Dale said that you didn't even

01:44:04.699 --> 01:44:08.286
Honestly, like, from now on, from

01:44:08.454 --> 01:44:12.249
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's

01:44:12.416 --> 01:44:15.418
...I Wanna be a better friend to you,

01:44:16.212 --> 01:44:19.089
I fucking love you, dog.

01:44:19.715 --> 01:44:21.800


01:44:23.052 --> 01:44:24.802


01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:27.514
- This is my moment.

01:44:30.101 --> 01:44:31.601


01:44:49.287 --> 01:44:52.205


01:44:52.373 --> 01:44:54.249


01:44:54.417 --> 01:44:56.835


01:44:59.254 --> 01:45:01.005


01:45:01.172 --> 01:45:03.132


01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:06.428


01:45:06.595 --> 01:45:09.639


01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:18.565


01:45:18.733 --> 01:45:20.275


01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:32.911


01:45:34.456 --> 01:45:36.665


01:45:36.833 --> 01:45:38.500


01:46:14.997 --> 01:46:16.039


01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:22.169


01:46:29.303 --> 01:46:34.766


01:46:39.062 --> 01:46:40.687


01:46:46.237 --> 01:46:49.197
Wake up, man! This place

01:46:49.365 --> 01:46:51.199


01:46:53.244 --> 01:46:55.078


01:46:55.246 --> 01:46:58.123


01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:28.319


01:47:28.487 --> 01:47:29.946


01:47:30.114 --> 01:47:31.614


01:47:31.782 --> 01:47:34.200


01:47:36.704 --> 01:47:39.414


01:47:42.252 --> 01:47:44.044


01:47:44.212 --> 01:47:45.671


01:47:45.839 --> 01:47:48.381
- What?

01:47:48.549 --> 01:47:50.467


01:47:50.634 --> 01:47:52.677


01:47:52.845 --> 01:47:55.387
- You saved me.

01:47:55.555 --> 01:47:58.599
- Yeah.

01:47:58.766 --> 01:48:01.478


01:48:07.985 --> 01:48:10.403


01:48:14.325 --> 01:48:16.034


01:48:18.829 --> 01:48:20.663


01:48:20.831 --> 01:48:22.707
- Red?

01:48:25.544 --> 01:48:28.338
- Red.

01:48:28.506 --> 01:48:31.841
Red. Where'd you come from, man?

01:48:32.009 --> 01:48:33.092


01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.344
- He saved us?

01:48:34.512 --> 01:48:35.929


01:48:36.096 --> 01:48:38.223
- We all saved each other.

01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:41.267


01:48:41.435 --> 01:48:45.063


01:48:50.528 --> 01:48:55.489
Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.

01:48:55.657 --> 01:48:59.494
The topic of the day: New beginnings.

01:48:59.662 --> 01:49:02.038


01:49:02.206 --> 01:49:04.832


01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.627


01:49:07.795 --> 01:49:09.420


01:49:09.588 --> 01:49:12.632
You are. You're about

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.883


01:49:14.051 --> 01:49:15.385
- Dale Denton?

01:49:15.553 --> 01:49:20.224


01:49:20.892 --> 01:49:22.393


01:49:22.561 --> 01:49:24.478
- Thanks.

01:49:24.646 --> 01:49:26.647
- It sounds pretty good.

01:49:26.814 --> 01:49:29.606
- It's not bad, huh?

01:49:29.774 --> 01:49:32.901
- You are on the radio.

01:49:33.069 --> 01:49:35.904
- If you were on it, I would listen to it.

01:49:36.072 --> 01:49:38.449
It's like when my bubbe

01:49:38.617 --> 01:49:40.451


01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:43.413
Then it grows on you.

01:49:43.581 --> 01:49:46.207
It's like Red. I didn't like Red

01:49:46.375 --> 01:49:48.459
- You didn't like me?

01:49:48.627 --> 01:49:50.420


01:49:50.588 --> 01:49:54.048
I know this sounds weird, but can

01:49:54.216 --> 01:49:56.259
- We should all be best friends.

01:49:56.427 --> 01:49:59.638
Seriously. You guys are, like,

01:49:59.806 --> 01:50:02.599
You didn't know it. Now you know it,

01:50:02.766 --> 01:50:04.976
Know those hearts that break up,

01:50:05.144 --> 01:50:06.561


01:50:06.729 --> 01:50:10.356
- I don't know if they make those.

01:50:10.524 --> 01:50:13.443
I want the middle piece,

01:50:13.611 --> 01:50:17.530
I know We've gone over this, but, like,

01:50:17.698 --> 01:50:20.450
- I fucked up...

01:50:20.618 --> 01:50:23.119
I know I was an asshole.

01:50:23.287 --> 01:50:26.164
- I know me and you had our deal.

01:50:26.332 --> 01:50:29.208
I feel like something's happening here.

01:50:29.376 --> 01:50:32.128
Is that a condo? That us moving

01:50:32.296 --> 01:50:33.837


01:50:34.005 --> 01:50:36.423
- You threw an ashtray at his face.

01:50:36.591 --> 01:50:38.968
At the time, I was like:

01:50:39.136 --> 01:50:41.679


01:50:41.847 --> 01:50:44.974
I didn't Wanna hurt you.

01:50:45.142 --> 01:50:47.143
- That was such a good fight, man.

01:50:47.311 --> 01:50:48.770


01:50:48.937 --> 01:50:51.481
- The car chase was awesome.

01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:54.275
- Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.

01:50:54.443 --> 01:50:57.363
I, like, had my foot

01:50:57.530 --> 01:51:01.575
My groin... I mean,

01:51:03.328 --> 01:51:06.537
- I just feel different about everything.

01:51:06.705 --> 01:51:08.789
Like, I never Wanna

01:51:08.956 --> 01:51:10.832
- Ever.

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.834
You can just kind of

01:51:13.002 --> 01:51:14.878
We kind of dipped our toes

01:51:15.046 --> 01:51:17.507
I killed six guys, I think.

01:51:17.675 --> 01:51:19.550
- We each shot several people.

01:51:19.718 --> 01:51:21.719
Some people get a taste for it,

01:51:21.887 --> 01:51:25.014
I shot someone who was already dead

01:51:25.182 --> 01:51:27.350
Apparently you hit him

01:51:27.518 --> 01:51:30.061
- That... You killed him.

01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:32.563
- You murdered, man.

01:51:32.731 --> 01:51:35.316
- That's cool. Whatever. Kill or be killed.

01:51:35.485 --> 01:51:37.277
I'm trying to decide

01:51:37.445 --> 01:51:39.655
...and just how on the verge

01:51:39.823 --> 01:51:43.282
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned

01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:46.285
- You've been shot, like, seven times.

01:51:46.453 --> 01:51:48.204
- You're losing stuft.

01:51:48.372 --> 01:51:50.248
- Here.

01:51:50.416 --> 01:51:53.875
- Here comes the airplane.

01:51:56.088 --> 01:51:58.548
It's a miracle.

01:51:58.716 --> 01:52:01.300
...and think about what a miracle

01:52:01.468 --> 01:52:03.469
And that we became friends

01:52:03.637 --> 01:52:05.888
...and learned some shit about life

01:52:06.056 --> 01:52:10.268
Should we touch each other's hands

01:52:12.312 --> 01:52:13.729


01:52:13.897 --> 01:52:16.273


01:52:19.194 --> 01:52:21.862
I'll remember that

01:52:22.739 --> 01:52:24.198
- Red?

01:52:24.366 --> 01:52:26.367


01:52:26.535 --> 01:52:27.868


01:52:28.787 --> 01:52:30.287
- Hey.

01:52:30.455 --> 01:52:34.167
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover

01:52:34.335 --> 01:52:36.586
That's okay. We Won't put

01:52:36.754 --> 01:52:40.215
- Oh, God.

01:52:40.383 --> 01:52:42.508


01:52:42.676 --> 01:52:44.593
Yeah, maybe

01:52:44.761 --> 01:52:46.887
Do you think she'll drive me

01:52:47.055 --> 01:52:48.972
Me too. I should

01:52:49.139 --> 01:52:51.391
My ear should probably

01:52:51.559 --> 01:52:53.644
- It is bad.

01:52:53.812 --> 01:52:56.856
Either I'm getting ready to die

01:52:57.023 --> 01:52:58.899
If somebody could get me

01:52:59.067 --> 01:53:00.651


01:53:00.819 --> 01:53:03.612


01:53:04.823 --> 01:53:07.491
You are in serious danger.
