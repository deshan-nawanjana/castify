WEBVTT

01:14.005 --> 01:17.633
- When did it start?
- At 0500. We're seven minutes in.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.477
Private Miller...

01:27.645 --> 01:30.688
...you've been smoking Item 9
for seven minutes and 13 seconds.

01:30.855 --> 01:32.814
We're going to ask you
several questions.

01:32.982 --> 01:33.982
How do you feel?

01:34.984 --> 01:36.401
Well, sir...

01:36.569 --> 01:38.319
...I feel like a...

01:39.196 --> 01:41.530
Like a slice of butter...

01:42.241 --> 01:48.121
...melting on top
of a big old pile of flapjacks.

01:50.708 --> 01:51.750
Yeah.

01:52.168 --> 01:55.295
Okay, Private Miller,
when you think of your superiors...

01:55.880 --> 01:58.340
...what emotions do you feel?

02:05.265 --> 02:07.015
Okay, Private Miller?

02:10.645 --> 02:11.687
Is this normal?

02:11.854 --> 02:13.522
Okay, Private...

02:14.565 --> 02:16.441
Okay, Private Miller?

02:16.609 --> 02:18.193
Private Miller.

02:21.698 --> 02:23.241
Answer the question.

02:29.414 --> 02:30.539
This went out, sir.

02:30.707 --> 02:33.375
Can you torch me?

02:33.543 --> 02:35.168
We'll send someone in.

02:36.379 --> 02:38.504
Holy bejesus!

02:44.137 --> 02:47.055
Private Miller, answer the question.

02:47.223 --> 02:48.765
What was the question again, sir?

02:49.225 --> 02:53.395
When you think of your superiors,
what emotions do you feel?

02:53.730 --> 02:55.314
You know what problem I have...

02:55.481 --> 02:58.817
...with your fucking little
dog-and-pony act you call the military?

02:58.985 --> 03:02.363
Here it is. One: Lots of dudes.

03:02.531 --> 03:03.948
Where are the boobies?

03:04.116 --> 03:07.577
Two: Why are We
underground right now, sir?

03:07.745 --> 03:10.913
Why can't we be out in the open?
Why aren't we in a square right now?

03:11.081 --> 03:14.415
Why aren't we talking to people,
letting them know Item 9 exists?

03:14.583 --> 03:17.126
Get it out. Shout off the rooftops:

03:17.294 --> 03:21.798
"This is great!
This is the bee's knees, Item 9!"

03:21.966 --> 03:23.633
Private, we need you to be serious.

03:23.801 --> 03:27.554
I'm serious. Your dick, my mouth.

03:31.642 --> 03:33.393
That's inappropriate.

03:41.653 --> 03:42.695
Fuck you!

03:42.863 --> 03:46.531
I've seen enough. Shut it down.

03:46.699 --> 03:50.285
Bury the hatch. Sell the land.
And dispose of him.

03:50.453 --> 03:51.787
This never happened.

03:51.954 --> 03:53.580
Dude, what happened to your eye?

03:54.207 --> 03:55.791
Hello.

03:56.834 --> 03:58.126
Can you guys understand me?

03:58.294 --> 04:01.172
- Hey. Hey, where we going?
- This is General Brat.

04:01.340 --> 04:04.132
We've reached
a final conclusion on Item 9.

04:04.634 --> 04:06.385
Illegal!

04:06.552 --> 04:08.011
Hey, this is Sam. Good morning.

04:08.179 --> 04:09.346
Welcome to KRAD.

04:09.514 --> 04:12.474
You know, I think that last caller
had some undeniable points.

04:12.642 --> 04:15.310
Right now, we're gonna get
to the next caller, Dale Denton.

04:15.478 --> 04:17.396
Hey, Sam. Big huge fan.
First-time caller.

04:19.315 --> 04:20.899
- Here's my piece.
- All right.

04:21.067 --> 04:23.819
If marijuana is not legal
within the next five years...

04:23.986 --> 04:27.072
...I have no faith
left in humanity, period.

04:27.240 --> 04:29.074
Everyone likes smoking weed.

04:29.242 --> 04:32.661
They have for thousands of years.
They're not gonna stop anytime soon.

04:32.829 --> 04:34.996
It makes everything better. Makes
food better. Makes music better.

04:35.164 --> 04:37.499
It makes sex feel better,
for God's sakes.

04:37.667 --> 04:40.503
It makes shitty movies better,
you know?

04:49.430 --> 04:51.805
Hi, there. Are you Sandra Danby?

04:51.973 --> 04:53.013
Yeah.

04:53.181 --> 04:57.810
Well, I'm Garth
from Global Saviors, and...

04:57.978 --> 04:59.229
- What is this?
- I'm joking.

04:59.397 --> 05:01.606
You failed to show up
for divorce proceedings...

05:02.900 --> 05:05.569
...four times under court order,
and you've been served.

05:05.736 --> 05:08.238
- Oh, great. Thanks a lot, asshole.
- Sorry.

05:08.406 --> 05:10.991
I'm just saying love has no age.

05:11.159 --> 05:14.369
You can't instantly tell me that a man,
because he's a certain age...

05:14.537 --> 05:16.496
...can't marry a woman
or love a woman.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.040
I'm dating a high-school girl.

05:18.208 --> 05:21.961
You're not maximizing your potential.
Think this girl takes you seriously?

05:22.129 --> 05:25.506
No, but if I'm 25
and the girl is 18 years old...

05:25.673 --> 05:27.716
...you know, in society,
that might look bad.

05:27.884 --> 05:31.011
- Hey, as long as it's consensual.
- I think it's consensual.

05:32.346 --> 05:34.139
Yo, you been served.

05:34.307 --> 05:37.726
You've been served.
You've been served.

05:37.894 --> 05:39.978
You've been served.

05:47.278 --> 05:49.070
Walter Wadska the third.

05:49.238 --> 05:51.573
You here to fix the fax machine?

05:51.741 --> 05:54.993
No, I'm here to tell you
you owe MasterCard 4068 bucks.

05:55.161 --> 05:57.538
You've been served by the best.
Keep it real.

06:03.544 --> 06:06.588
Why don't you get a real job,
you fucking cocksucker?

06:11.844 --> 06:15.972
- Hey, "Electric Avenue."
- I know, right?

06:16.140 --> 06:20.353
- Take that shit to the next level, eh?
- Okay, I will.

06:31.781 --> 06:34.406
- Dr. Edgar Terrence?
- Yes.

06:34.574 --> 06:37.077
You have repeatedly refused
to trim the monkey tree...

06:37.245 --> 06:39.287
...that spills
onto your neighbor's property.

06:39.455 --> 06:42.040
And nowbecause of that,
you've been served.

06:42.208 --> 06:43.291
You're a jerk.

06:43.459 --> 06:45.460
All this current system is doing...

06:45.628 --> 06:47.879
...is putting money
in the hands of criminals...

06:48.047 --> 06:51.758
...and it's making ordinary people like
you and me deal with those criminals.

06:51.926 --> 06:55.388
You ever dealt with a drug dealer?
It's terrible, it's weird, it's awkward.

06:55.556 --> 06:57.557
They think they're your friend,
but they're not.

06:57.724 --> 07:01.686
Dale, I get your point. Thanks
for your input. Next caller, please.

07:14.322 --> 07:16.116
I can't come.

07:16.993 --> 07:18.493
What?

07:19.328 --> 07:20.662
Why the fuck not, Dale?

07:20.830 --> 07:22.163
I just... Look, I can't come.

07:22.331 --> 07:25.083
I have a lot of stuff to do tomorrow.
It's a bad day for me.

07:25.251 --> 07:28.420
Jesus Christ, Dale.
When Were you gonna tell me?

07:28.588 --> 07:30.130
My mom has been shopping all day.

07:30.298 --> 07:32.173
- Why?
- She's already planning on couscous.

07:32.341 --> 07:35.344
I said I might be able to go,
so why is she doing that already?

07:35.512 --> 07:37.513
- How I look like an asshole.
- You are one.

07:37.681 --> 07:40.390
Come on, don't say that.
I just can't go. I have a job.

07:40.558 --> 07:42.017
- Fine.
- "Fine"?

07:42.184 --> 07:43.643
Don't come. I don't care.

07:43.811 --> 07:47.105
Then Why have you been inviting me?
I thought you wanted me to go.

07:47.273 --> 07:49.524
If you don't wanna meet them,
I don't want you to.

07:49.692 --> 07:53.320
I want to. I can't. I have a job.
I'm sorry. What do you want from me?

07:53.487 --> 07:55.990
I just know they'll like you, that's all.

07:56.158 --> 07:58.326
You're great, and you're funny...

07:58.493 --> 08:00.369
...and you're sexy.

08:00.787 --> 08:02.996
I just want them to see that.

08:03.164 --> 08:05.832
- You Want them to see that I'm sexy?
- Hey, people?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.542
- Hi, Mr. Edwards.
- Can I help you?

08:07.710 --> 08:09.711
No, I'm good. Thank you, though.

08:09.879 --> 08:12.881
Yeah? I see you don't have
a visitor's badge. That's why I ask.

08:13.049 --> 08:16.051
- I'm with her, actually.
- Actually, this is my boyfriend.

08:17.261 --> 08:20.513
I heard that. I wish I didn't hear that,
but I just heard that.

08:20.681 --> 08:22.015
What's that supposed to mean?

08:22.183 --> 08:25.810
I'm just wondering Why you don't
date a nice guy your own age.

08:25.978 --> 08:27.937
- She's very mature for her age.
- Yeah.

08:28.105 --> 08:29.689
- Angie, hey. How's it going?
- Hey.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.900
Hey, Clark, how you doing, man?
What's up?

08:32.068 --> 08:34.862
I'm good, bro. I'm good.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.656
Dude, I wanted to tell you.

08:36.823 --> 08:38.699
You were hilarious today
in drama class.

08:38.867 --> 08:41.410
Your Jeff Goldblum impression
made me pee my pants.

08:42.037 --> 08:43.079
I wish.

08:43.997 --> 08:45.831
Oh, hey, I almost forgot.

08:45.999 --> 08:48.541
Last week when we worked out,
you forgot your shorts in my car.

08:48.709 --> 08:50.084
Oh, yeah.

08:50.251 --> 08:51.669
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

08:51.836 --> 08:53.254
Yeah, no problem, no problem.

08:53.422 --> 08:54.881
- Can you hold those?
- Yeah.

08:55.049 --> 08:57.092
- Yeah.
- How's it going, Sporty Spice?

08:57.259 --> 08:58.551
This is my boyfriend, Dale.

08:58.719 --> 09:00.178
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- You too.

09:00.346 --> 09:02.472

I know there's tons of guys that are
gonna be trying to get on that shit.

09:15.570 --> 09:17.446
- Oh, good.
- Because I got that... Yeah.

09:17.614 --> 09:19.281
You got her ass? Perfect.

09:33.463 --> 09:35.381
- All right, Clark.
- Clark's a great guy.

09:35.549 --> 09:37.632
He's totally gonna take care
of Angela, man.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.969
He's great. He's a wonderful
lab partner. He'll keep an eye on her.

09:41.137 --> 09:43.388
Why don't you go fuck yourself,
you weird prick?

09:43.556 --> 09:45.640
I'm a teacher.
You can't talk to me like that.

09:45.808 --> 09:48.101
I'm not a student,
so I can say whatever I Want...

09:48.269 --> 09:50.520
...you chimp-fucking little bastard.
- Actually...

09:50.688 --> 09:53.482
You've got T-minus 30 seconds
to get off school property...

09:53.650 --> 09:55.316
...or I call the liaison officer.

09:55.484 --> 09:58.653
- We're leaving. I'm sorry.
- Middle finger won't stop the clock.

09:58.821 --> 09:59.821
What a jerk.

09:59.989 --> 10:01.740
What's that guy's problem? Jesus.

10:01.907 --> 10:04.951
I don't... Normally he's...
That's really weird.

10:05.119 --> 10:08.121
I'd love to have dinner with you
and your parents tomorrow night.

10:08.289 --> 10:11.167
I'm gonna go. I'll definitely go.
I'll shuffle things around...

10:11.334 --> 10:13.210
- Really?
- Yeah, I'll be there for sure.

10:13.378 --> 10:15.755
Yeah, I Wanna show them
you're in good hands. Yeah.

10:15.922 --> 10:17.673
I got nothing
to be embarrassed about.

10:17.841 --> 10:19.675
That means so much to me
and my parents.

10:19.843 --> 10:22.845
No problem.
It's gonna be awesome.

10:24.014 --> 10:27.015
- Hello?
- Hey, Saul. Mind if I come by?

10:27.666 --> 10:30.210
- Come on down.
- Sweet. Be there.

10:30.378 --> 10:32.045
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

10:32.213 --> 10:34.840
I thought the hurricane season
was over.

10:35.007 --> 10:36.675
I thought hurricane season
was over.

10:36.843 --> 10:38.635
I'm sorry.
Things just got out of hand.

10:38.803 --> 10:41.179
Yeah, that's the way it was
with my first husband.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.059
Hello? Hey, man.

10:46.227 --> 10:47.978
What the fuck, man?

10:48.145 --> 10:50.773
I didn't buzz you in.
How the monkey did you get in here?

10:50.941 --> 10:54.110
Some guy with a fauxhawk let me in.
He was leaving when I...

10:54.278 --> 10:56.404
- Fucking Kyle.
- It might have been Kyle.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.197
- Asshole.
- I'm sorry, man.

10:58.365 --> 11:00.408
What the fuck's
the buzzer for anyway?

11:00.576 --> 11:04.077
I don't know. I'm sorry about that.
I don't knowyour protocol yet.

11:04.245 --> 11:06.496
Stuff your sorries in a sack.
It's not your fault.

11:06.664 --> 11:09.625
- Okay.
- It's these jerk-offs. Have a seat.

11:09.793 --> 11:11.794
Okay, cool.
Thanks, man. Awesome.

11:11.962 --> 11:14.170
Yo, check this out.

11:16.507 --> 11:19.259
Satellite radio.

11:19.427 --> 11:22.387
Got two TVs and radio.
That's pretty rad.

11:22.555 --> 11:23.847
That's home entertainment.

11:24.015 --> 11:27.225
You're very entertained.
Oh, wow. You got a cute picture too.

11:27.393 --> 11:29.520
Oh, yeah. Me and my bubbe.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.606
Hey, let me ask you something.

11:31.773 --> 11:33.107
Yeah?

11:33.984 --> 11:37.485
Do you think you could pull the plug
on someone if you needed to?

11:37.653 --> 11:39.738
Like, euthanasia?

11:41.866 --> 11:43.909
Like, on her?

11:44.076 --> 11:45.911
If I needed to.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.876
I'm kind of in a hurry, man.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.712
I don't knowif we should
start going down that road.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.840
I could talk all day about euthanasia.
Don't get me started.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.550
- Maybe we should...
- We'll save it.

11:59.718 --> 12:02.052
- Save it for next time.
- I'll take that rain check.

12:02.219 --> 12:03.637
Business for the businessman.

12:03.804 --> 12:05.931
- Yeah, you got my number.
- Okay.

12:06.098 --> 12:07.516
- Brass tacks.
- Yes.

12:07.684 --> 12:11.102
Just got a shipment
of the dopest dope I've ever smoked.

12:11.270 --> 12:13.146
Hands down,
dopest dope I've ever smoked.

12:13.314 --> 12:16.399
Not better than the Blue Oyster.
It can't be. I can't handle that.

12:16.567 --> 12:21.237
This is like if that Blue Oyster shit
met that Afghan Kush I had...

12:21.405 --> 12:22.864
...and they had a baby.

12:23.032 --> 12:25.867
And meanwhile, that crazy
Northern Lights stuff I had...

12:26.035 --> 12:29.705
...and the Super Red Especial
Snowflake met and had a baby.

12:29.873 --> 12:33.334
And by some miracle,
those two babies met and fucked...

12:33.502 --> 12:36.712
...this would be the shit
that they birthed.

12:36.880 --> 12:39.215
- Yes.
- This is the product of baby fucking.

12:39.383 --> 12:40.675
- Smell it.
- Okay.

12:40.842 --> 12:43.176
Smell it. Enjoy.

12:43.344 --> 12:46.514
It's like God's vagina.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.516
What, you wanna bathe in it?

12:49.684 --> 12:51.559
- I wanna live in here.
- You Wanna be it?

12:51.727 --> 12:54.854
My God, I just wanna shove it
up my nose, have that smell all day.

12:55.022 --> 12:57.107
- That's amazing.
- Shove it anywhere you like.

12:57.274 --> 12:58.566
Beautiful. What's it called?

12:58.734 --> 13:00.860
- Pineapple Express.
- Pineapple Express.

13:03.197 --> 13:06.200
This airflow that comes
from Hawaii and Canada.

13:06.368 --> 13:09.245
It gets the dirt, mixes it in
with the weed in a special way.

13:09.413 --> 13:11.747
It's very scientific.
I won't go into it right now.

13:11.915 --> 13:14.583
But I am the only guy
in the whole city that has it.

13:14.751 --> 13:16.334
Only 10 bones more for a quarter.

13:16.502 --> 13:18.211
Okay, I'll take a quarter.

13:18.379 --> 13:20.380
- All right, you're on.
- Thank you very much.

13:20.548 --> 13:21.881
Let me get my scale.

13:22.049 --> 13:25.428
Get it going. Grab the scale.
Let's get me out of here.

13:26.555 --> 13:29.390
I thought hurricane season
was over.

13:30.308 --> 13:32.643
Oh, crow.

13:34.896 --> 13:37.772
Where are you, you little fucker?

13:39.191 --> 13:42.402
What the fuck is this thing?

13:43.654 --> 13:45.072
- Cross joint.
- Yeah.

13:45.240 --> 13:47.575
- You ever smoke one of those?
- You can smoke this?

13:47.743 --> 13:48.826
- Yeah, man.
- No.

13:48.993 --> 13:51.077
This is the future.

13:51.245 --> 13:56.082
This is, like, the apex
of the vortex of joint engineering.

13:56.250 --> 13:59.502
It's rumored that M. M. O,Shaughnessy
designed the first one.

13:59.670 --> 14:02.255
The guy who designed
the Golden Gate Bridge.

14:02.423 --> 14:04.675
My second favorite civil engineer...

14:04.843 --> 14:08.721
...behind Hannskarl Bandel,
Madison Square Garden.

14:08.889 --> 14:12.683
What you do is you light all three ends
at the same time.

14:12.851 --> 14:16.103
- Really?
- And then the smoke converges...

14:16.271 --> 14:20.357
...creating a trifecta
of joint-smoking power.

14:20.525 --> 14:23.777
This is it, man. This is what your
grandchildren are gonna be smoking.

14:23.945 --> 14:25.945
Future. The future.

14:26.113 --> 14:28.656
That's amazing.
Well, got the weed?

14:28.824 --> 14:31.743
- Yeah.
- In the bag. Beautiful. Okay.

14:32.411 --> 14:35.830
Be careful with that thing, man.
Here's the cash, grab the stash.

14:35.998 --> 14:37.791
Alrighty, man, thanks.
Have a good one.

14:37.958 --> 14:39.751
Don't hurt yourself. Adios.

14:39.919 --> 14:42.045
Well, hey, wait a minute, man.

14:42.213 --> 14:43.964
Let's smoke this fucking thing.

14:44.132 --> 14:45.966
I really... I can't, man. I gotta...

14:46.134 --> 14:48.260
I can't even light this thing
on my own.

14:48.970 --> 14:51.347
Yeah, I need your help, man.

14:51.973 --> 14:53.808
- I'm in.
- Come on!

14:53.975 --> 14:56.768
- Why not? Let's do it.
- Come on down!

14:56.936 --> 14:58.812
Why not? What do I do?

14:58.979 --> 15:00.146
Okay, here's What you do.

15:00.314 --> 15:02.023
- You equip yourself.
- I'm equipping.

15:02.191 --> 15:03.609
- Equip me, sir.
- Okay.

15:04.528 --> 15:08.656
You are going to light these tWo ends
while I light this end.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.574
- Okay.
- Are you ready?

15:10.742 --> 15:13.618
- Ready.
- Blast off.

15:29.718 --> 15:32.345
- I'm gonna do it.
- Good. Go for it.

15:44.151 --> 15:45.860
It's better to cough.

15:46.027 --> 15:47.570
It's like...

15:47.737 --> 15:49.363
Makes you 10 times more higher...

15:49.531 --> 15:51.782
...than the cross Weed
and the Pineapple Express.

15:51.950 --> 15:55.744
You're like,
totally fucking Gong Show,ed, man.

16:08.716 --> 16:10.091
Oh, fuck.

16:10.259 --> 16:11.718
Hang on one second, man.

16:11.886 --> 16:12.927
Oh, you fucker.

16:17.892 --> 16:19.100
Who is it?

16:19.268 --> 16:21.103
It's Chris Gebert, man. Let me up.

16:21.271 --> 16:22.479
Shit.

16:22.898 --> 16:24.231
What's a Gebert?

16:24.399 --> 16:25.983
Come on up.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.486
He ain't getting any
of that Pineapple Express.

16:29.654 --> 16:34.033
Chris is getting Snicklefritz.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.327
Hey.

16:37.494 --> 16:39.495
So listen, man.

16:39.663 --> 16:42.082
I gotta ask you. So...

16:42.250 --> 16:46.212
Listen, man. You've been buying
from me for, like, tWo months, right?

16:46.379 --> 16:48.672
- Two months.
- I gotta ask, man.

16:48.839 --> 16:50.381
What's up with the suit?

16:50.549 --> 16:53.343
I'm a process server.
So I have to wear a suit.

16:53.510 --> 16:57.889
Wow, you're a servant?
Like a butler?

16:58.057 --> 17:01.268
- A chauffeur?
- No. No. What? No, I'm not...

17:01.436 --> 17:04.521
- Shine shoes?
- I'm a process server.

17:04.689 --> 17:06.190
- I like...
- In process.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.317
I work for a company
that's, like, hired...

17:08.485 --> 17:10.485
...by lawyers to hand out
legal documents.

17:10.653 --> 17:12.779
Like subpoenas to people
who don't want them.

17:12.947 --> 17:16.783
I gotta wear disguises sometimes just to
make them admit they're themselves...

17:16.951 --> 17:19.202
...so I can serve them the papers.

17:19.370 --> 17:20.412
Disguise.

17:20.580 --> 17:21.705
Kind of, I guess.

17:21.873 --> 17:23.916
- It's a hell of a job.
- That's cool, man.

17:24.084 --> 17:28.254
Like a day-to-day basis, it's fine.
Like today, I, like, sat in my car...

17:28.421 --> 17:29.880
...I smoked, like, 10 doobies...

17:30.048 --> 17:32.549
...and then I went to go visit
my girlfriend at lunch.

17:32.717 --> 17:34.343
Nice.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.970
What? You sucked on her titties?

17:37.137 --> 17:40.182
No, I just kissed her.
I just did that to make it seem cool.

17:40.350 --> 17:42.851
That's cool.
Does she like to smoke weed?

17:43.019 --> 17:45.144
A little sometimes.
She has a couple...

17:45.312 --> 17:48.064
She's in high school,
so as much as any high-school kid.

17:48.232 --> 17:50.066
She's cool as hell, actually.

17:50.234 --> 17:51.985
- You'd get along With her.
- Really?

17:52.152 --> 17:54.862
Yeah, you know, it only sucks...

17:55.030 --> 17:58.784
...when I go visit her in high school
and the guys she goes to school with...

17:58.952 --> 18:01.370
...are strong and handsome
and really funny.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.415
Like, do good impressions
of Jeff Goldblum and shit like that.

18:04.582 --> 18:09.586
And, like, I just feel like a fat, dumb,
fucking stinky ass-turd when I'm there.

18:09.754 --> 18:11.964
- What?
- It really... It sucks for my ego.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.508
- Fuck Jeff Goldblum, man.
- That's what I say.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.344
You know, don't get down on yourself.
You got a great girl.

18:17.511 --> 18:19.930
You got a great job
where you don't do anything.

18:20.098 --> 18:22.224
You get to smoke weed all day.

18:22.392 --> 18:23.767
I wish I had that.

18:23.935 --> 18:27.270
Are you kidd...? You do.
You have the easiest job on Earth.

18:27.438 --> 18:30.523
- You do smoke weed all day.
- That's true.

18:30.691 --> 18:33.151
You didn't think of that.

18:33.319 --> 18:35.361
- I do have a good job.
- Yeah, you do nothing.

18:35.529 --> 18:36.779
- Thanks, man.
- No prob.

18:36.947 --> 18:38.574
Thank you.

18:38.742 --> 18:41.869
Oh, shit. All right. Business.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.872
- Got my persona.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.540
Hey. Put that cross joint out.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.126
He sees that, he'll never
get the fuck out of here.

18:50.961 --> 18:52.503
- What's up, Chris?
- Yo, hey, Saul.

18:52.671 --> 18:54.005
- Hey.
- How you doing, buddy?

18:54.173 --> 18:55.465
All right, homes. Good.

18:55.632 --> 18:57.760
- Who's this?
- Hey. Oh, that's my friend Mark.

18:57.927 --> 18:59.887
You got the dough? There you go.

19:00.055 --> 19:02.222
- Appreciate it.
- Nice. Good to meet you, Mark.

19:02.724 --> 19:04.767
- Do you have any Percocet, please?
- Percocet?

19:04.934 --> 19:07.269
What are you talking about?
I don't sell that shit.

19:07.437 --> 19:08.479
- Chris.
- Chris.

19:08.646 --> 19:10.397
You told him I was
gonna sell Percocet?

19:10.565 --> 19:13.066
- I didn't say anything about Percocet.
- What the fuck?

19:13.233 --> 19:15.443
- I just wanted a couple Percocets.
- Well, I...

19:15.611 --> 19:17.529
You came to the wrong place.
Wrong place.

19:17.697 --> 19:20.574
- Sorry.
- Yeah, nice. Peace out, homes.

19:20.742 --> 19:21.992
- Thank...
- God.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.161
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.162
- Fucking lingerer.
- Yeah, totally.

19:26.330 --> 19:27.705
- Lingerer.
- Hardcore.

19:27.873 --> 19:29.374
Fuck.

19:30.292 --> 19:32.085
- Bums me out.
- Bums me out too.

19:32.252 --> 19:35.880
If there's one quality
I hate in a person, it's lingering.

19:36.049 --> 19:38.759
- That's right. You and me both.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:38.927 --> 19:42.179
So I'm curious. What have
those people done that you go...

19:42.347 --> 19:44.431
...and process and service?

19:44.599 --> 19:47.101
I don't know. It's alWays
something different, I guess.

19:47.268 --> 19:48.560
This guy...

19:48.728 --> 19:51.438
Ted Jones, who knows. You know?

19:51.606 --> 19:53.857
- Ted Jones?
- Yeah, why?

19:54.025 --> 19:57.821
My guy, Red, who I buy from,
he gets his stuff from a Ted Jones.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.905
- Really?
- Maybe it's the same guy.

20:00.073 --> 20:01.114
That'd be weird.

20:01.281 --> 20:03.825
It's a pretty normal name,
I guess, but...

20:03.992 --> 20:07.537
Anyway, I should really
get going, man. I gotta go.

20:07.704 --> 20:10.039
Duty calls, but it's good to see you.
Thanks.

20:10.207 --> 20:12.834
You're gonna smoke and run?
Come on, man.

20:13.001 --> 20:16.046
We can go look at some crazy things
on the Internet together.

20:16.214 --> 20:19.341
That sounds appealing, but I think
I should probably just get going.

20:19.509 --> 20:20.926
- Oh, that sucks.
- Yeah.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.387
That's cool, man.
What are you doing this weekend?

20:23.555 --> 20:26.473
Because, you know, my bubbe's
got season tickets to the opera...

20:26.641 --> 20:29.810
...and she can't make it,
so wanna go see Phantom?

20:29.978 --> 20:32.854
- Of the Opera?
- Yeah.

20:34.064 --> 20:36.483
I can't this weekend,
but you know what? Here.

20:36.651 --> 20:40.362
You know... I'll run out of weed in
a couple days. I'll come by, hang out.

20:40.530 --> 20:43.323
- We'll watch 227 and shit.
- Definitely.

20:43.491 --> 20:45.367
Cool, man. Well, thanks.
Good to see you.

20:45.535 --> 20:46.702
- Peace, brother.
- Okay.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.370
One love.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.707
When you got behind
on the mortgage...

20:50.875 --> 20:52.667
...someone finally
made you a loan?

20:52.835 --> 20:53.918
Yes, he did.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.714
Yes, he did.
What was the interest rate you gotu

20:56.882 --> 21:01.469
- It was 12 or 13 percent.
- That's disgusting.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.979
- Hello?
- Hello.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.774
Hey, Angie, what's happening?

21:14.941 --> 21:18.402
I just talked to my mom, and they are
so excited you're coming for dinner.

21:18.570 --> 21:21.739
Like, so excited. And so am I,
but we're all really excited.

21:21.907 --> 21:22.907
Thank you so much.

21:23.075 --> 21:25.409
No problem. I'm psyched too.
It's gonna be awesome.

21:25.577 --> 21:29.246
Couscous. The food so nice,
they named it twice.

21:30.749 --> 21:34.127
Dale, anyway, I can't wait
for next year when this bullshit's over.

21:34.295 --> 21:37.213
Oh, shit. I see the guy I gotta serve.
I'll call you back.

21:37.381 --> 21:39.297
Fucking cops. Shit.

21:46.389 --> 21:48.223
Jesus.

21:52.896 --> 21:55.439
What an adorable little cop.

21:55.941 --> 21:57.525
Weird.

22:02.447 --> 22:03.948
Jesus. Fuck.

22:04.116 --> 22:06.117
What the fuck was that?

22:06.284 --> 22:07.576
Oh, shit.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.414
Dude. Dude. Dude. Dude.

22:11.581 --> 22:12.623
Oh, no!

22:24.760 --> 22:27.762
- Drive, drive.
- Who the fuck is that?

22:27.930 --> 22:29.931
I don't know,
but I ain't waiting to see.

23:00.255 --> 23:01.839
Pineapple Express.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.968
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

23:06.136 --> 23:07.636
I sawbrains and blood!

23:07.804 --> 23:09.263
Come on! Come on!

23:09.431 --> 23:10.515
Where do I go?

23:26.906 --> 23:27.947
Hello?

23:28.115 --> 23:29.866
Saul, it's Dale.
Let me in. Let me in.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.495
I just saw some crazy shit.
Please. Let me in.

23:32.662 --> 23:35.456
- It's Dale Denton. Let me in, man?
- Dale?

23:35.624 --> 23:38.250
Yes, Dale. That's what I said.
It's Dale. Let me in.

23:38.418 --> 23:40.503
Oh, all right, man. Come on up.

23:44.508 --> 23:46.675
I buzzed it. Open the door
when I buzz it.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.677
Buzz it in three seconds exactly.

23:48.845 --> 23:51.306
One, two...

23:51.474 --> 23:53.516
- Did it work?
- On three!

23:53.683 --> 23:56.519
I did it on three.
On "one, two, three, go"?

23:56.686 --> 23:58.437
Just on three.

24:08.697 --> 24:11.033
- He fucking killed him.
- Hey, I got neighbors.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.660
He fucking killed him.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.788
- Who killed who?
- A cop. A lady and a guy.

24:15.956 --> 24:19.083
A cop, a lady and a guy?
That's a massacre. You saw it?

24:19.251 --> 24:21.252
No, it was just a guy.

24:21.419 --> 24:23.087
- What happened to the lady?
- No. No.

24:23.255 --> 24:27.924
A woman. A policewoman and a guy,
another guy, shot another guy...

24:28.092 --> 24:31.095
...an Asian guy, in the window,
at fucking Ted's house.

24:31.263 --> 24:32.846
Whoa, was the other guy Ted?

24:33.014 --> 24:35.099
I don't know.
He was a big, gray-haired man...

24:35.267 --> 24:37.017
...and he had a robe
and he shot him.

24:37.185 --> 24:40.104
And his brain flew every...
I'm gonna be... I'm gonna throw up.

24:40.272 --> 24:41.730
What?

24:42.816 --> 24:45.192
- That was chicken fries.
- Sick.

24:45.360 --> 24:46.777
You threw up on my printer.

24:46.945 --> 24:48.279
- I did.
- Did you break it?

24:48.446 --> 24:50.364
- I hope not.
- Listen, man.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.032
I think the guy was Ted.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.034
And the Asians
are number-two in town...

24:54.202 --> 24:56.120
...so you sawTed
capping the competition.

24:56.288 --> 24:58.122
They saw me
seeing them shoot the guy.

24:58.290 --> 24:59.957
What? They saw you?

25:00.124 --> 25:01.457
And you fucking came here?

25:01.625 --> 25:03.626
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know.

25:03.794 --> 25:08.048
- Did they follow you here?
- I don't know. Look. Look. Okay.

25:09.593 --> 25:10.926
I sawthem kill him.

25:11.094 --> 25:13.804
I freaked out. I panicked, okay?

25:13.972 --> 25:16.140
I tossed my roach.

25:16.308 --> 25:18.767
- I crashed into two cars.
- Yeah.

25:18.935 --> 25:22.062
So they must have heard...
They knowsomeone was out there.

25:22.230 --> 25:24.356
- They know someone saw.
- They know "someone."

25:24.524 --> 25:27.152
They don't know it was you. Right?

25:27.320 --> 25:30.739
I don't... I mean, yeah. I don't know.

25:30.906 --> 25:32.490
- Yes.
- I hope not.

25:32.658 --> 25:33.699
Relax.

25:33.867 --> 25:38.661
Just sit back. Get ready to enjoy some
of the rarest weed known to mankind.

25:41.123 --> 25:42.665
Is it really that rare?

25:43.125 --> 25:45.168
It's, like, the rarest.

25:46.170 --> 25:47.838
It's almost a shame to smoke it.

25:48.590 --> 25:51.967
It's like killing a unicorn...

25:52.135 --> 25:53.844
...with, like, a bomb.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.307
Are you the only guy in town
who has this?

25:58.475 --> 26:00.601
- You're actually the only guy?
- Yeah.

26:00.769 --> 26:04.355
My guy Red said he was giving me
an exclusive sneak preview.

26:04.522 --> 26:07.608
I'm the only guy you sold it to?
The other guys got Snicklefritz?

26:07.776 --> 26:10.861
Yeah. So We're, like, the only guys.

26:11.029 --> 26:12.863
And Red got this from Ted?

26:13.031 --> 26:14.365
Ted's the man.

26:15.033 --> 26:18.077
Let's get the fuck out of here!
Go! Go! Let's go! Let's go!

26:18.244 --> 26:20.579
I threw a roach of this
outside of Ted's house.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.748
So what? I throw roaches
all over town.

26:22.916 --> 26:26.335
No. He could find the roach
and say, "It's Pineapple Express.

26:26.503 --> 26:28.712
Saul is the only guy
who has Pineapple Express.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.964
He must have seen the murder!
Let's kill him!"

26:31.132 --> 26:32.549
- Let's get out of here!
- Fuck!

26:32.717 --> 26:35.552
Wait! Stop!
Get weed! Get the weed!

26:35.720 --> 26:38.889
Anything we might need.
Snacks, food, Fruit Roll-Ups.

26:39.057 --> 26:41.182
- Let's get the fuck out of here!
- Okay, okay.

27:00.245 --> 27:02.413
Red said he'd be here.

27:10.047 --> 27:12.381
Them some drugs.

27:14.505 --> 27:16.089
Smells like vomit in this house.

27:16.256 --> 27:18.132
Want a hit, man? It's still lit.

27:18.300 --> 27:20.468
I'm having dinner with my wife.
She can tell.

27:20.636 --> 27:22.303
Smell it on my sweater.

27:22.471 --> 27:23.930
For real?

27:24.099 --> 27:25.391
Yeah, for real.

27:25.558 --> 27:28.352
You wanna wear my vest?
It smell good.

27:28.520 --> 27:29.603
Not my style.

27:29.771 --> 27:32.106
You ain't got no style, motherfucker.

27:32.273 --> 27:34.733
You have reached
the voice mailbox of...

27:34.901 --> 27:36.527
- Ted.
- Ted, it's Budlofsky.

27:36.695 --> 27:39.488
- We're here. Saul's gone.
- And Mathe...

27:41.032 --> 27:43.702
- And Matheson.
- I think he knew We Were coming.

27:43.869 --> 27:44.994
They not here, Ted.

27:45.162 --> 27:46.871
Hi, Ted.

27:47.456 --> 27:49.748
Okay, what do you know
about Ted?

27:49.916 --> 27:51.792
I think he's crazy about murdering.

27:51.960 --> 27:54.294
Jesus, man.
Well, how much money do you have?

27:54.462 --> 27:57.631
- I have, like, the 75 that you gave me.
- That's it?

27:57.799 --> 27:59.675
- Well, howmuch do you have?
- Three bucks.

27:59.842 --> 28:02.427
What you getting on my case for?
I have more than you.

28:02.594 --> 28:06.348
Well, that's my 75 technically.
So I have $78 and you have nothing.

28:06.516 --> 28:10.894
I don't know. Let's just go... Go to
a motel or a hotel and just hide out.

28:11.062 --> 28:14.648
The police were in on it. Could have
flagged credit cards. They'll find us.

28:15.275 --> 28:18.819
Shit. I wish We could
just go nowhere.

28:20.947 --> 28:22.113
Okay.

28:22.281 --> 28:27.995
Even if he found that roach,
how could he knowwhere you are?

28:29.456 --> 28:31.290
Heat-seeking missiles.

28:33.001 --> 28:34.126
Bloodhounds.

28:35.170 --> 28:36.712
Foxes.

28:36.880 --> 28:38.505
Barracudas.

28:38.673 --> 28:41.884
I'm kind of flabbergasted when
you say things like that. It's Weird.

28:42.052 --> 28:43.094
Thank you.

28:43.262 --> 28:45.305
Not a compliment.
Here's the question.

28:45.473 --> 28:47.390
Let's say he actually
found the roach.

28:47.558 --> 28:51.769
How could he connect
the Pineapple Express weed to you?

28:51.936 --> 28:55.271
He can't, man.
Only fucking Red knows.

28:55.439 --> 28:57.315
Only Red knows, man.

28:57.483 --> 28:58.900
Who is Red?

28:59.067 --> 29:02.738
Red's, like, the middleman
between, like, Ted and me.

29:02.906 --> 29:04.990
And we're, like,
mad fucking tight, man.

29:05.158 --> 29:07.242
One time, he got this girl...

29:07.410 --> 29:10.829
...to give me a hand job, like,
within five minutes of meeting her.

29:10.997 --> 29:15.542
It was like, "I don't
even know your name, whoa."

29:15.919 --> 29:20.881
That is pretty rad, but, like,
let's say Ted calls him and is like:

29:21.050 --> 29:23.218
"Did you sell the Pineapple Express
to anyone?"

29:23.385 --> 29:26.012
He'll be, "Yeah, I sold it to Saul."
Why wouldn't he?

29:26.180 --> 29:28.889
No. Oh, no. Fuck that, man.

29:29.057 --> 29:32.643
Fucking hand job, Dale.
Imagine if I gave you a hand job.

29:32.811 --> 29:36.646
- Why would I wanna do that?
- No, I mean if I got you a hand job.

29:36.814 --> 29:39.273
The same rules don't apply to Red.
He's a drug dealer.

29:41.277 --> 29:45.072
I'm a drug dealer.
Are you saying you don't trust me?

29:45.865 --> 29:48.367
No, that's not at all what I'm...
You know what?

29:48.535 --> 29:52.496
You know? Just ignore What I said.
Call him. Give him a call.

29:52.664 --> 29:54.289
See what the dealio is.

29:58.002 --> 29:59.795
- Hello.
- Hey, Red, you okay?

29:59.963 --> 30:03.090
Yeah, Saul. Yeah, I'm fine, man.
I just stubbed my toe.

30:03.258 --> 30:06.260
Be careful, man. Be careful.
Wear shoes in the house.

30:06.427 --> 30:09.429
Safety. Safety first, then teamwork.
Now, listen.

30:09.597 --> 30:12.099
You know that Pineapple Express stuff
you gave me?

30:12.267 --> 30:14.935
Don't tell anybody
that you sold it to me.

30:15.103 --> 30:16.395
I'd never talk to anyone...

30:16.563 --> 30:20.775
...about the stuft that I do with you
involving drugs.

30:20.943 --> 30:23.444
All right, cool.
Listen, I'm gonna come by.

30:23.611 --> 30:25.445
I gotta lay some shit on you.

30:25.613 --> 30:27.239
There is a fly in the ointment.

30:27.407 --> 30:29.950
Shit has hit the fan.
The lion will speak.

30:30.118 --> 30:32.452
- I'm in the middle of a convo.
- No, seriously.

30:32.620 --> 30:35.122
- We're gonna be there in half an hour.
- Perfect.

30:35.290 --> 30:38.291
- No, please. No, no, no.
- Let's go over there and chill out.

30:38.458 --> 30:40.919
No, can we go tomorrow?
Look, we're already here...

30:41.087 --> 30:43.505
There's somebody else
on the phone with him.

30:43.673 --> 30:44.715
- Who?
- I don't know.

30:44.883 --> 30:46.508
He's whispering to another man.

30:46.676 --> 30:49.511
We'll go in the morning.
It's better that way.

30:49.679 --> 30:53.181
- Okay.
- Yes. Yes. Thank you. Yes.

30:53.349 --> 30:55.767
- Hey.
- So you're coming by tomorrow?

30:55.935 --> 30:56.977
How'd you know that?

30:57.145 --> 31:01.024
Heard you whispering to that other guy
that you were talking to. Who is that?

31:01.191 --> 31:03.818
Right, Dale. Good job.
Listen, I can't go in the morning...

31:03.986 --> 31:06.821
...because my bubbe... Gotta change
her clocks. Daylight-savings.

31:06.989 --> 31:09.489
Is that the bubbe
that's on 41 st and River Street?

31:09.657 --> 31:12.074
The one where we played
shuffleboard that one time?

31:12.242 --> 31:14.869
You got it. So, listen,
we'll be chilling by noon.

31:15.329 --> 31:18.165
- Noon it is, bromosexual.
- Nice.

31:18.333 --> 31:21.001
We should hit up the casino again.
It's been a while.

31:21.169 --> 31:23.837
Okay, yeah.
We'll definitely hit the casino up.

31:24.005 --> 31:27.299
Definitely. All right, peace, brother.

31:28.051 --> 31:29.343
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

31:29.510 --> 31:31.386
- Why'd he mention a casino?
- I don't know.

31:31.554 --> 31:34.348
You make me call my good
friend, send him into a booby trap.

31:34.515 --> 31:36.183
- And lie to him.
- Is Saul Asian?

31:36.351 --> 31:38.353
- Making me a shitty person.
- Is he Asian?

31:38.520 --> 31:39.896
- He's not Asian.
- You're lying.

31:40.064 --> 31:42.607
- I'm not lying. I'm not lying.
- You're lying.

31:42.774 --> 31:44.316
Did you hear slot machines?

31:44.484 --> 31:47.110
- Man, I don't know where he is.
- You tell me Where he is.

31:47.278 --> 31:50.155
Tell me. In 45 minutes,
I gotta go have dinner with my wife.

31:50.323 --> 31:51.907
- I got a reservation.
- Forty-five?

31:52.075 --> 31:54.242
That's a dinner reservation
you gonna miss.

31:54.410 --> 31:55.869
That's a reservation I'll make.

31:56.037 --> 31:58.456
- I don't think so.
- Because if he doesn't start to...

31:58.624 --> 32:02.709
- Look, can you do this one solo?
- No, I can't do this solo. Are you crazy?

32:02.877 --> 32:06.505
- What are you talking about? What?
- What, you trying to abandon me?

32:06.673 --> 32:09.758
This is teamwork. This is a
partnership. We are in this together.

32:09.926 --> 32:11.551
- You want me to stay?
- Yes.

32:11.719 --> 32:13.053
- Fine, I'll stay.
- Thank you.

32:13.221 --> 32:15.222
- You happy now?
- Yes.

32:15.390 --> 32:17.683
There's no way that
we could pause for a minute...

32:17.850 --> 32:19.184
...you guys go home...

32:19.352 --> 32:22.479
...and then tomorrow we
could just, like, continue?

32:27.237 --> 32:29.405
I should call Angie soon.

32:29.572 --> 32:32.616
Make up some bullshit.

32:32.784 --> 32:33.867
I'm cold.

32:34.035 --> 32:37.122
You're cold?
Oh, I'm not cold at all. Here.

32:37.289 --> 32:38.289
I run hot.

32:38.457 --> 32:39.791
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:39.959 --> 32:43.253
- You got more body mass.
- Thick blood. Yeah, no, take it.

32:43.421 --> 32:46.631
- Thank you.
- I don't appreciate that, but it's okay.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.049
I'm gonna call Angie.

32:55.640 --> 32:57.307
Space.

32:59.477 --> 33:00.894
Dale, wait. Wait.

33:02.188 --> 33:04.648
The phones. The phones.

33:04.816 --> 33:07.109
- You said they Were cops, right?
- They are, yeah.

33:07.277 --> 33:08.819
I was thinking, maybe they can...

33:08.987 --> 33:11.738
...triangulate these things, man,
or, like, trace them.

33:11.906 --> 33:13.824
- Right?
- That's how they got Saddam.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.827
- Right.
- Fuck. You're right, man.

33:15.995 --> 33:17.662
Maybe they can even trace them...

33:17.830 --> 33:20.290
...like, when We're not even
on them, you know?

33:20.458 --> 33:23.959
Maybe if we bury them, the reception
will cut off and they won't be able to.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.086
We can tie it to an animal,
be a diversion.

33:26.254 --> 33:27.713
We'll never catch an animal.

33:27.881 --> 33:30.340
The squirrel'd be up in a tree,
they'd think we were.

33:30.508 --> 33:32.134
No, no, no.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.679
- We'll build a hot-air balloon and...
- No.

33:34.847 --> 33:36.221
- We'll smash them.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:36.389 --> 33:37.806
I'm gonna smash it. On a rock.

33:37.974 --> 33:40.893
- Right here. Good thinking.
- Good idea. Yes, destroy it.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.270
- Get it.
- Die. Yes.

33:44.939 --> 33:48.108
- What the fuck was that?
- I was trying to hit that tree. I missed.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.486
- What tree?
- That one.

33:50.653 --> 33:53.197
Why didn't you smash it
on a rock like a normal person?

33:53.364 --> 33:56.201
I don't know. How often does
somebody smash things? I'm rusty.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.327
Did you at least see
where it landed?

33:58.495 --> 34:00.120
I don't know. Call it.

34:00.747 --> 34:03.999
Call it? With What?
My phone has been smashed.

34:05.668 --> 34:07.794
I bet they can't even triangulate
those things.

34:07.962 --> 34:11.423
Well, you convinced me they can.
You were very convincing back there.

34:11.591 --> 34:14.219
Hey. Fine. I'll go find it. Fuck.

34:14.386 --> 34:16.513
- Do you see it?
- See What?

34:16.680 --> 34:18.932
The phone, you idiot.

34:19.099 --> 34:21.893
Why are we here?
This place is so fucking scary.

34:22.061 --> 34:24.353
At least I had an idea.
You didn't, so shut up.

34:24.521 --> 34:27.272
That's not true. I had two ideas.
Nowhere and Quiznos.

34:27.899 --> 34:29.441
- What?
- What was that?

34:29.609 --> 34:30.691
- What?
- What is that?

34:30.859 --> 34:33.737
- What?
- I hear something.

34:33.905 --> 34:34.947
What?

34:35.114 --> 34:36.990
I don't know. Do you hear that?

34:37.158 --> 34:39.535
Dude, I literally hear nothing.

34:40.411 --> 34:41.453
Oh, fuck!

34:41.621 --> 34:44.998
Where are you going? What are
you running from? Return to me now!

34:47.544 --> 34:48.585
Help me!

34:49.587 --> 34:51.088
Tell him to get away from me!

34:51.256 --> 34:53.424
I'm scared of this darkness!
I surrender!

34:53.592 --> 34:55.426
- Go away! Go away!
- I'm unarmed!

34:57.263 --> 34:59.264
- This isn't funny anymore!
- Dale!

34:59.431 --> 35:01.182
- Fall back!
- Save me!

35:14.028 --> 35:15.362
Oh, shit.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.407
Car.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.750
Open it! Open it!
Open the door! Open it!

35:28.918 --> 35:31.169
- Unlock it.
- I can't unlock it.

35:31.337 --> 35:33.631
What are you doing?
Watch the upholstery.

35:33.799 --> 35:37.468
- Go! I saw something!
- Go! What did you see? Shut up!

35:37.635 --> 35:41.138
Shut the fuck... Shut up, man!

35:41.306 --> 35:43.599
I heard something,
then I saw something.

35:43.766 --> 35:45.475
You didn't hear anything, man.

35:45.643 --> 35:47.477
Well, I saw something.

35:51.317 --> 35:54.652
And you're telling me that guy
in the little short shorts...

35:54.820 --> 35:56.195
...broke your nose?
- Right.

35:56.363 --> 36:00.282
The BeDazzler guy
broke your nose, tough man?

36:14.964 --> 36:17.299
Wake up. Get up. Wake up.

36:18.009 --> 36:20.260
How did I get on you?

36:21.012 --> 36:22.679
I wonder.

36:26.267 --> 36:28.560
Watch finally broke.

36:28.728 --> 36:30.355
Crazy. What time is it?

36:34.193 --> 36:35.485
That can't be right.

36:36.737 --> 36:38.821
It couldn't be 3 in the morning,
could it?

36:38.989 --> 36:41.074
It's 3:00 right now?

36:41.241 --> 36:42.784
Holy shit, man!

36:42.951 --> 36:46.453
We were supposed to be at Red's
at noon, man. What if he's gone?

36:46.621 --> 36:48.079
No, it's daylight-savings, so...

36:48.246 --> 36:51.249
- So it's only 2:00.
- Oh, no, it went forward an hour.

36:51.417 --> 36:55.712
It's 4 o,-fucking-clock?
Fuck me. No, man. That's bad.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.049
Shit. We slept for, like, 18 hours.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.760
My bubbe...
Man, my bubbe's gonna be so pissed.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.011
Shit.

37:03.179 --> 37:05.013
We gotta call Red.

37:05.181 --> 37:07.766
Okay. Now?

37:07.934 --> 37:09.977
We'll go to a pay phone.

37:10.145 --> 37:13.398
No, I can't.
His number is in my phone.

37:13.565 --> 37:15.566
Great. Well, do you remember
where he lives?

37:15.734 --> 37:17.068
Yeah, I know where he lives.

37:17.236 --> 37:19.361
What are you insinuating?
Like, I'm forgetful?

37:19.529 --> 37:20.946
"Insinuating." Good word.

37:21.114 --> 37:22.406
Do you know what that means?

37:22.573 --> 37:25.575
- I do, believe it or not.
- It means, like, "to seem like."

37:28.413 --> 37:30.540
Let's roll. I'm done With the woods.
Let's go.

37:30.708 --> 37:32.709
Come on, let's get
the fuck out of here.

37:32.876 --> 37:36.753
Okay. Let's go. No. It's not working.
The battery's dead.

37:36.921 --> 37:38.588
Wait.

37:39.549 --> 37:40.882
What do you mean, it's dead?

37:41.050 --> 37:44.594
What do I mean? I mean
the battery's dead. The battery's dead.

37:44.762 --> 37:46.430
What do you mean,
the battery's dead?

37:46.597 --> 37:49.100
How can I explain this
to you differently?

37:49.268 --> 37:52.269
The battery is dead.
It ceased to live.

37:52.437 --> 37:55.939
It's deceased now. The car
needs a battery to start, Saul.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.859
How did this happen?

37:59.026 --> 38:01.778
Well, we clearly fell asleep
with the battery on, and...

38:01.946 --> 38:03.905
Oh, man. To talk radio?

38:04.073 --> 38:06.450
- Yes, talk radio.
- It's so boring, man.

38:06.617 --> 38:09.412
- Okay, okay.
- The car just committed suicide.

38:09.580 --> 38:11.706
Shut up, man. I have an idea now.

38:11.874 --> 38:13.124
We're gonna go.

38:13.292 --> 38:16.002
We'll walk back to the road.
We'll hitchhike.

38:16.170 --> 38:18.129
Someone will pick us up,
take us to Red's.

38:18.297 --> 38:21.507
Red Will tell us everything's fine,
everything will go back to normal.

38:21.675 --> 38:22.966
How does that sound? Good?

38:23.134 --> 38:24.968
- That's a good idea.
- Keep our heads on.

38:25.136 --> 38:27.721
If we just keep thinking like this,
we're fucking gravy.

38:27.889 --> 38:29.931
- All right. I'm in.
- Let's do it.

38:38.357 --> 38:40.776
- Can I have my jacket back, please?
- Yeah.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.320
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.405
Thanks for taking care of it.

39:26.156 --> 39:28.449
Look, it's like my thumb is my cock.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.120
That's not gonna get us a ride, man.

39:41.337 --> 39:43.129
Here's good.

39:48.887 --> 39:50.721
Thanks for the smooth sailing,
Sharid.

39:50.889 --> 39:52.473
You're welcome.

39:57.646 --> 39:59.980
- You're sure We can trust this guy?
- Yo, Red.

40:00.690 --> 40:01.773
Who is it?

40:01.941 --> 40:05.611
- It's Bruce.
- Bruce? Who the fuck is this?

40:05.779 --> 40:08.947
- Saul. What's up?
- Who do you think it is?

40:09.115 --> 40:10.156
Who's this?

40:10.324 --> 40:12.284
I'm Dale, Mr. Red. Nice to meet you.

40:12.451 --> 40:13.493
Dale who?

40:13.661 --> 40:15.620
It's best if you don't know
my full name.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.080
Dale Denton. He's with me.

40:17.248 --> 40:19.583
Dale Denton. Nice to meet you, bro.

40:19.750 --> 40:22.460
- Hold on. Let me get this lock, okay?
- You better.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.922
- Get in here.
- Coming in.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.800
- Y,all Wanna buy some drugs?
- Frisk me.

40:27.968 --> 40:30.052
- What's up? What's up?
- Get it.

40:30.220 --> 40:32.138
Look at that, huh?

40:33.015 --> 40:35.558
- What's up, players?
- What's up?

40:35.726 --> 40:40.353
I've been up in here trying to get
a motherfucking scholarship. Chilling.

40:40.521 --> 40:41.938
What's up with the clothes?

40:43.649 --> 40:44.984
We were camping.

40:45.152 --> 40:46.611
- Camping?
- Yeah.

40:46.777 --> 40:49.863
Is your lip okay, man?

40:50.031 --> 40:52.073
- You been crying?
- Oh, my lip.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.200
It's a cold sore.

40:54.368 --> 40:57.787
Never had one before,
so I started to cry.

40:58.956 --> 41:01.166
I think it's a lot worse
than it looks, though.

41:01.334 --> 41:03.920
Cold sore?
Does that mean fucking herpes?

41:04.421 --> 41:06.589
Yeah. Yes, it does.

41:06.757 --> 41:09.592
Fucking sick, man. You know
how many joints we've shared?

41:09.760 --> 41:12.470
I know. I'm a disgusting person.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.137
Herpes is for life, bro.

41:14.305 --> 41:17.807
I'm gonna try to definitely put
some sort of medical ointment on it.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.602
Been taking Vicodin.
Doesn't really take swelling down.

41:20.770 --> 41:22.479
It's from that time. I told you, man.

41:22.647 --> 41:26.025
You ate that lollipop out of that
stripper's snatch. You wanted to do it.

41:26.193 --> 41:28.861
Out of her vagina. Remember
what you did? What did you do?

41:29.029 --> 41:32.323
You ate a box of Nerds
out of her butthole.

41:32.491 --> 41:35.951
You fucking said you wouldn't tell.
You sowed your own poison, man.

41:36.118 --> 41:38.787
Dudes, seriously, we're here
for a reason. Just ask him.

41:38.955 --> 41:43.167
Chill. I'm boiling some eggs over here.
We got a lot of time to hang out.

41:43.335 --> 41:45.086
- I'm making a fucking cake.
- No shit.

41:45.253 --> 41:46.504
Can I have a piece of thatu

41:46.672 --> 41:48.964
- Don't ask for a piece.
- I can't have a piece?

41:49.131 --> 41:50.632
No, you can't. This is private.

41:50.800 --> 41:52.550
Do you know what today is?

41:52.718 --> 41:55.679
- Tuesday.
- This is my cat's birthday today.

41:55.846 --> 41:59.015
I don't see a cat in here. I'm sorry.
You let it out by accident?

41:59.183 --> 42:01.142
No, because he died
three months ago, okay?

42:01.310 --> 42:02.645
So now who's the funny guy?

42:02.938 --> 42:03.980
Sorry.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.231
Today is his birthday...

42:05.399 --> 42:08.734
...and it is a tradition
that on his birthday...

42:08.902 --> 42:12.196
...I get up extra early and make him
his favorite kind of dessert.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.699
Don't worry, bro.
Your cat's going to heaven.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.534
Yeah, maybe.
Maybe he went to heaven.

42:16.702 --> 42:18.828
He was a little fucker.
Could've gone to hell.

42:18.996 --> 42:20.204
What are we talk...? Guys...

42:20.371 --> 42:21.872
Ask him. Just ask him, okay?

42:22.040 --> 42:24.165
Ask What? Just come straight.
What's up?

42:24.333 --> 42:26.334
- Yeah, right.
- Lay it on him.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.461
We need to know...

42:28.629 --> 42:30.380
We need to know
about your source.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.881
- Ted.
- Ted Jones.

42:32.049 --> 42:35.719
See, Dale, here,
is a protest servant.

42:35.886 --> 42:37.345
I'm not. That's not what I am.

42:37.513 --> 42:40.640
He's not that,
but he was outside Ted's house...

42:40.809 --> 42:45.813
Don't... Look, we don't want
to bring you in to What we're in, okay?

42:45.981 --> 42:48.733
You don't Want any trouble.
We don't Wanna give you trouble.

42:48.900 --> 42:51.318
It's probably best
you don't know the whole story.

42:51.486 --> 42:54.362
- Don't think I can handle danger?
- What are you talking about?

42:54.530 --> 42:56.406
- You can.
- I totally can.

42:56.574 --> 42:58.366
And for you
to come into my house...

42:58.534 --> 43:01.746
...and not tell secrets
because you think you're saving me...

43:01.913 --> 43:04.623
...well, in reality, it just makes
you look like a dumb-ass.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.042
Look at this. See this?

43:06.752 --> 43:09.003
You see that?
There's no hair under here, okay?

43:09.171 --> 43:10.628
What's the significance of that?

43:10.796 --> 43:13.590
It makes me aerodynamic
when I fight. I can take danger.

43:13.758 --> 43:17.469
Okay, has anyone called asking
about Saul or the Pineapple Express?

43:17.636 --> 43:20.097
That's all we need to know.

43:23.226 --> 43:24.769
Is it "uh-huh" or "uh-uh"?

43:24.936 --> 43:26.937
- It's "uh-uh."
- There it is, man.

43:27.105 --> 43:30.023
Cleared. Over.

43:30.191 --> 43:32.150
Everything's fine. I told you, bro.

43:32.318 --> 43:33.985
We had a Wacky night
in the woods...

43:34.153 --> 43:36.780
...but we both can put that
behind us like adults.

43:36.947 --> 43:39.074
Now it's time
to get super-duper high.

43:39.242 --> 43:40.701
Got that bong I got in Tel Aviv?

43:40.869 --> 43:42.203
"Bong Mitzvah." Hit it up.

43:42.370 --> 43:44.080
Yes.

43:44.498 --> 43:45.790
There you go.

43:45.957 --> 43:47.958
Why don't you follow his lead
and chill out?

43:48.126 --> 43:50.252
I'm chill.
I'm chill as a cucumber, man.

43:50.420 --> 43:52.963
- You don't seem chill.
- More chill than you.

43:53.131 --> 43:54.381
You're more chill than me?

43:54.549 --> 43:57.093
Look at what I'm Wearing. Kimono.
What are you wearing?

43:57.260 --> 43:59.136
- Suit.
- Yeah. Exactly.

43:59.304 --> 44:02.514
I don't knowwhat's up with you,
but I don't knowif I like you.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.808
Well, I don't know
if I like you either, man.

44:04.975 --> 44:07.310
Well, that's your loss,
because I'm a great friend.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.230
I'm gonna use the telefono
to call my wife, okay?

44:10.397 --> 44:11.564
- Give her a call.
- I will.

44:11.732 --> 44:12.359
- Go ahead.
- Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

44:12.360 --> 44:13.444
- Go ahead.
- Sit on my couch...

44:13.611 --> 44:15.696
...my chillastic couch, and chill out.

44:15.864 --> 44:18.575
- I'm chilling right here.
- Don't listen to what I'm saying.

44:18.742 --> 44:21.077
- This is private. This is my wife.
- I'm listening.

44:21.245 --> 44:23.455
I'm not trying to be enemies.
I don't wanna be.

44:23.622 --> 44:25.290
- I wanna be friends.
- Well, then good.

44:25.458 --> 44:27.083
- I wanna be best friends.
- Come here.

44:27.251 --> 44:29.502
- Shake my fucking hand.
- Shake my hand. Okay.

44:29.670 --> 44:31.629
- See, we can be friends.
- I'm feeling it.

44:31.797 --> 44:35.007
- You feel that? We can be best friends.
- I'm looking through you, man.

44:35.175 --> 44:36.592
I'm looking through you too...

44:36.759 --> 44:39.554
...and I see I need to paint
the spot on the wall behind you.

44:39.722 --> 44:41.473
- I'm looking through you.
- Transparent.

44:41.640 --> 44:45.310
- I see your intentions.
- I see your intestines and intentions.

44:45.603 --> 44:48.645
- What'd I have for dinner last night?
- Cake.

44:48.938 --> 44:50.939
I'll be right back.
Make this phone call.

44:53.359 --> 44:54.443
Bullshit.

44:55.193 --> 44:56.986
No, no, no.

44:57.154 --> 44:58.655
- Liar.
- What are you doing, man?

44:58.823 --> 45:01.283
He's a liar. He's lying to us, man.
He's lying to us.

45:01.451 --> 45:02.451
No, he's not.

45:02.618 --> 45:04.494
He knows my name.
He's acting weird.

45:04.662 --> 45:06.621
We can't let him
phone anyone, man.

45:06.789 --> 45:09.248
Freaking out. You're paranoid.
Give him the phone.

45:09.416 --> 45:10.666
I do not trust you, sir.

45:10.834 --> 45:12.585
- You're paranoid.
- He's acting weird.

45:12.753 --> 45:14.754
Red, I'm sorry, bro.

45:14.921 --> 45:16.505
- Jesus!
- Holy cock.

45:16.673 --> 45:17.841
Fuck you!

45:18.009 --> 45:19.676
What are you doing, man?
He's sorry.

45:19.844 --> 45:21.136
Oh, Jesus.

45:23.514 --> 45:25.223
Herpes!

45:25.558 --> 45:27.517
I don't wanna have to do this.

45:27.685 --> 45:28.852
Red, you're crazy, man.

45:29.020 --> 45:31.021
You brought the devil
into my house.

45:31.189 --> 45:32.898
- We're friends.
- I know we are.

45:33.065 --> 45:35.149
- That's why it sucks.
- Are you on meth again?

45:36.819 --> 45:39.321
Dale, he's hurting me!

45:39.489 --> 45:41.031
Toilet.

45:41.199 --> 45:42.698
Flush.

45:42.866 --> 45:46.076
What we do in this life
echoes in eternity.

45:46.244 --> 45:48.579
True!

46:00.968 --> 46:04.721
He's going for the phone
to call Ted!

46:05.348 --> 46:07.224
Stay out of here!

46:10.061 --> 46:12.479
Red, don't do it!

46:14.524 --> 46:16.233
- Red!
- You assholes.

46:16.400 --> 46:17.984
You ruined my portable phone.

46:18.152 --> 46:20.362
- TeamWork.
- Yes.

46:21.656 --> 46:23.739
You're gonna break the door.
Gonna pay for it?

46:27.994 --> 46:29.078
Fuck.

46:29.246 --> 46:30.621
Phone.

46:32.958 --> 46:35.168
- Let go! Let go! Let go!
- What the hell...?

46:35.336 --> 46:37.879
I let go, now just get this
goddamn door off of me!

46:38.047 --> 46:39.548
Tell us everything, now!

46:39.715 --> 46:41.049
Said they were gonna kill me.

46:41.217 --> 46:43.218
What did you tell Ted?

46:43.386 --> 46:45.303
He's crushing my balls.
Crushing my balls.

46:45.471 --> 46:46.930
Smash them.

46:47.098 --> 46:48.139
Fuck!

46:48.307 --> 46:51.100
Time out. Time out.

46:51.268 --> 46:53.018
- Truce.
- Time in. Fuck you.

46:53.186 --> 46:54.980
- Stop!
- Cheater!

46:55.147 --> 46:56.940
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Red!

46:57.108 --> 46:59.526
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Get...

47:00.778 --> 47:01.778
Fuck.

47:03.281 --> 47:04.781
God...

47:04.949 --> 47:06.241
Fuck!

47:06.409 --> 47:08.410
- Take it, motherfucker!
- Time out!

47:10.745 --> 47:12.329
Fuck!

47:15.793 --> 47:17.168
No! No, no, no!

47:17.336 --> 47:19.212
Where you going, huh?

47:19.380 --> 47:21.464
Where do you think you're going,
Mr. Wiggles?

47:21.632 --> 47:24.383
- Come on. Get back here.
- Saul, help me! Help me!

47:24.551 --> 47:25.968
He's punching my bum!

47:26.136 --> 47:28.888
I'm done with this.
Let's talk. Let's try words.

47:29.055 --> 47:32.725
Use words! No! No! No!

47:35.938 --> 47:37.314
You okay, man?

47:37.481 --> 47:39.983
- I'll get you another bong.
- It's my cat's birthday.

47:41.319 --> 47:43.028
Happy birthday.

47:43.529 --> 47:44.571
- All right?
- Thank you.

47:44.739 --> 47:47.032
I think there's a package
in the mailbox.

47:47.199 --> 47:49.284
This ends now!

47:53.332 --> 47:54.790
Oh, shit.

47:54.958 --> 47:56.750
Was that too much?

47:58.627 --> 48:00.586
Can't get the edge.

48:01.129 --> 48:03.005
Wait. Got it. Got it.

48:03.173 --> 48:04.340
Hey, Dale.

48:04.507 --> 48:07.843
Think we're gonna have to kill him?
I don't think I'm capable of murder.

48:08.011 --> 48:09.219
I don't think I am either.

48:09.387 --> 48:12.181
Maybe we could just convince him
to kill himself.

48:12.350 --> 48:14.768
Or, just not say anything.

48:15.895 --> 48:19.147
We need to find out
everything he knows, okay?

48:19.982 --> 48:21.566
Wake up.

48:22.109 --> 48:23.234
Hey, what's up, dudes?

48:23.402 --> 48:26.488
What's up? Tell us everything now.

48:26.656 --> 48:27.697
Talk, Red.

48:27.865 --> 48:30.199
I'm gonna flex and bust out of here.

48:34.413 --> 48:35.622
Trapped.

48:35.790 --> 48:37.040
Not happening, Red.

48:37.208 --> 48:39.709
Okay. All right. Okay, I'll talk.

48:39.877 --> 48:44.381
Ted Jones, he knows you witnessed
the murder. He found your roach.

48:44.548 --> 48:47.549
He sent two guys over here,
Budlofsky and Matheson.

48:47.717 --> 48:50.052
Two real big son of a bitches.

48:50.220 --> 48:51.972
They're basically
out to kill you guys.

48:52.139 --> 48:54.766
They're gonna kill me too,
unless I turn y,all over.

48:54.934 --> 48:56.768
So you guys are basically fucked.

48:56.936 --> 48:59.562
How many cops does he have
on his payroll? Tell us.

48:59.730 --> 49:02.524
- Well, there's the woman cop, Carol.
- That's the lady cop.

49:02.692 --> 49:05.943
I don't know. He could have a bunch.
This dude is super well-connected.

49:06.111 --> 49:09.071
And he has a really awesome
hideout too. It's pretty badass.

49:09.239 --> 49:10.824
- Oh, shit.
- What else?

49:10.992 --> 49:13.201
He's at a war right now
with the Asians.

49:13.369 --> 49:14.828
They're in a drug war right now.

49:14.996 --> 49:17.330
Asians? What Asians?
Indians are technically Asian.

49:17.498 --> 49:19.082
- It's true.
- What Asians?

49:19.250 --> 49:23.086
I don't know. What? Chinese?
Or Korean or...

49:23.254 --> 49:24.254
Vietcong?

49:24.422 --> 49:27.090
Yeah, little... Just little Asian people.

49:27.258 --> 49:32.888
Like, the Asians with the guns
and the drugs, and not his friends.

49:33.056 --> 49:34.097
- Ding-dong.
- Hey, Red!

49:34.265 --> 49:35.598
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, they're here.

49:35.766 --> 49:37.099
They're here to kill me.

49:37.267 --> 49:41.145
Okay, I know I sold y,all out. I've been
a son of a bitch and a shitty friend.

49:41.312 --> 49:43.731
Saul, I'm talking to you.
Dale, you're a newfriend.

49:43.898 --> 49:46.108
I can make it up.
I forgot, "bro's before ho's."

49:46.276 --> 49:48.736
Just go out the back porch.
I won't say anything.

49:48.903 --> 49:50.280
- I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

49:50.448 --> 49:52.198
No sweat.

49:56.662 --> 49:58.580
It was Dale Denton.
Dale Denton and Saul.

49:58.748 --> 50:01.916
They're on the back porch.
You can catch them if you hurry. Go.

50:04.587 --> 50:06.171
Hey. In here.

50:06.338 --> 50:08.339
I've gotta get to a phone. Come on.

50:08.507 --> 50:10.133
- We should hide.
- Why?

50:10.301 --> 50:12.218
If Red tells Ted's guys
about my name...

50:12.386 --> 50:14.137
...then they'll go to my apartment.

50:14.305 --> 50:18.016
There, I have Angie's name. They'll
put that together, find her. Let's go.

50:18.184 --> 50:19.684
No. I think we should stay.

50:19.852 --> 50:22.186
- Why?
- I'm in the dumpster already.

50:22.353 --> 50:25.439
Well, then, get out.
Come on, you're already dirty.

50:27.400 --> 50:29.903
- They're gone.
- Well, find out what he knows.

50:30.071 --> 50:31.571
Red, it's your last chance, man.

50:31.739 --> 50:33.531
You gonna give us something
we can use?

50:33.699 --> 50:37.118
Matheson, you gotta be kidding me.
I mean, What more do you want?

50:37.286 --> 50:39.370
I told you that the guy's name
is Dale Denton.

50:39.538 --> 50:41.164
He's obviously working with Saul.

50:41.332 --> 50:43.333
They came in here,
busted my house to shit.

50:43.501 --> 50:45.167
They kicked the hell out of me...

50:45.335 --> 50:47.503
...duct-taped me
to my grandfather's wheelchair.

50:47.670 --> 50:50.173
What more do you want?
Want me to read your horoscope?

50:50.341 --> 50:54.010
- You hear that, Ted?
- Ask if either of them were Asian.

50:54.178 --> 50:56.679
- What skin color were they?
- They were white people.

50:56.847 --> 50:58.932
Denton might've been a Jew.
I don't know.

50:59.100 --> 51:01.267
I don't judge people
based on things like that.

51:01.435 --> 51:03.812
Obviously. We're friends.

51:03.979 --> 51:05.271
Ted, you hear him?

51:05.439 --> 51:09.360
Dale Denton: Not Asian.
All right. Kill Red.

51:09.528 --> 51:13.029
Listen, I would appreciate it
if both y,all would take your shoes off.

51:13.197 --> 51:15.698
This is brand-new carpet.
You're tracking mud in here.

51:15.866 --> 51:17.533
Matheson, you got
British Knights on.

51:17.700 --> 51:19.701
I ain't seen anybody wear them
since 1987.

51:21.371 --> 51:23.163
What the hell are you doing?

51:23.331 --> 51:25.040
Ted told me to kill him.

51:25.208 --> 51:28.044
Well, how about
a little fucking discretion here?

51:28.212 --> 51:30.088
See? See? See, right there.
You see that?

51:30.256 --> 51:31.381
- You catch it?
- See What?

51:31.549 --> 51:34.634
You used to not give
a fuck about discretion.

51:34.802 --> 51:37.846
I seen you pull somebody's
jawbone off. I seen it.

51:38.681 --> 51:40.098
You was ruthless.

51:40.266 --> 51:42.642
You was ruthless, man.

51:42.810 --> 51:45.895
What the fuck, man?
You shot me in my stomach.

51:46.564 --> 51:48.274
I'm gonna die now probably.

51:48.441 --> 51:51.860
I had you all over here for dinner.
Fish tacos.

51:52.027 --> 51:53.570
This how you do me?

51:57.116 --> 51:58.949
So, What did Budlofsky
and Matheson say?

51:59.117 --> 52:00.742
I don't know.

52:01.828 --> 52:04.163
There's this guy, Saul...

52:04.747 --> 52:07.667
...something, selling weed who Works
with some guy, Dale Denton.

52:07.835 --> 52:09.210
That's all he got out of him.

52:09.378 --> 52:12.797
Do you think he has anything to do
with the guy that We shot?

52:12.965 --> 52:14.841
Well, did he say anything else?

52:15.009 --> 52:18.261
Saul mentioned something about
"going to the casino."

52:18.429 --> 52:20.597
- Weird.
- "Going to the casino"?

52:20.764 --> 52:22.849
The Asians own the casino, Ted.

52:23.017 --> 52:26.436
- I need another beer.
- He's gotta be working for them.

52:26.937 --> 52:30.356
Maybe affer we popped that guy,
they hired this outside guy, Dale...

52:30.524 --> 52:32.692
What's his name? Denton?
- To finish the job.

52:33.152 --> 52:34.194
Maybe.

52:34.361 --> 52:37.488
Maybe. Well, I'll be back in an hour.

52:37.656 --> 52:41.159
I'll have everything there is to know
about this Dale Denton guy.

52:41.327 --> 52:44.746
Who he's screwing,
who's his mother, everything.

52:44.955 --> 52:46.539
I have to take a shit.

52:48.709 --> 52:50.543
Wait. Where are We going?

52:50.711 --> 52:55.006
I gotta... I gotta get to Angie's.
I have to make sure she's okay.

52:55.174 --> 52:57.634
What about my bubbe?
Don't think they'll go after her.

52:57.800 --> 53:00.385
I mean, she has
a difterent last name.

53:00.553 --> 53:01.887
Belogus.

53:02.055 --> 53:05.391
I don't know. We should get out of
the middle of the road. Come on.

53:21.533 --> 53:23.368
You guys can wait
as long as you want...

53:23.535 --> 53:27.289
...but one minute from right now,
I'm gonna eat some food.

53:27.457 --> 53:30.334
And you can call it rude.
You can call it Whatever you want.

53:30.502 --> 53:33.919
You can be polite with your clean
plates, but I'm gonna be eating food.

53:34.087 --> 53:35.128
Dad, he'll be here.

53:35.296 --> 53:38.340
I'm going in the other room and eat it,
check my e-mail. I'm done.

53:38.508 --> 53:41.510
Honey, we're at the table.
No one's going to leave the table.

53:44.556 --> 53:47.058
- Okay. This is it.
- All right. Let's do this.

53:47.226 --> 53:48.851
No, no, no. I'm going alone.

53:49.019 --> 53:51.062
- No.
- Yeah. Yeah.

53:51.230 --> 53:54.107
- I wanna meet Angie.
- You'll meet her later, man. Look.

53:54.275 --> 53:56.859
Look, I need you to stay out here.
Keep guard, okay?

53:57.027 --> 53:58.778
- It's important. Watch my back.
- Okay.

53:58.946 --> 54:01.072
- Thanks.
- All right. Just be yourself.

54:01.240 --> 54:02.949
I'll keep guard.

54:03.451 --> 54:05.034
Hey.

54:06.453 --> 54:08.037
Shit.

54:08.205 --> 54:09.747
Oh, no.

54:09.915 --> 54:10.957
Hey, Dale.

54:11.125 --> 54:14.043
- Hello, Dale.
- Hey.

54:14.211 --> 54:15.253
Dinner.

54:16.046 --> 54:20.341
This is the dinner you invited me to.
That was tonight. That's why I'm here.

54:20.509 --> 54:21.800
Sit. Please.

54:21.968 --> 54:24.262
Of course. Hi.

54:24.430 --> 54:26.055
- Hi.
- Shannon.

54:26.223 --> 54:27.849
- Intros.
- Great to meet you.

54:28.017 --> 54:30.727
- Robert, if I'm not mistaken.
- Sit down, so We can eat.

54:30.894 --> 54:33.354
- Hi, Dale.
- Hi. Okay.

54:33.522 --> 54:35.023
- What happened to you?
- Nothing.

54:35.190 --> 54:37.066
I'm supposed to be here right now.

54:37.234 --> 54:38.359
So I'm here.

54:38.526 --> 54:41.695
- You're all dirty and bleeding.
- No, I'm not. I'm here for dinner.

54:41.863 --> 54:45.700
- You have scratches on your forehead.
- Dude, you smell like shit.

54:45.868 --> 54:48.536
- Dale, what happened to you?
- I was in the woods.

54:48.704 --> 54:51.873
- In the Woods?
- Yeah. Isn't that weird? I was...

54:52.041 --> 54:53.916
- I was in the woods.
- What were you doing?

54:54.084 --> 54:56.419
I bird-watch. I don't.

54:56.587 --> 54:59.505
No, I don't.
Look, I'm gonna come clean.

55:00.674 --> 55:03.344
I witnessed a murder, okay?

55:03.511 --> 55:05.429
I sawsomeone
murder someone else...

55:05.597 --> 55:08.098
...and I think
they've been following me.

55:08.266 --> 55:10.558
There's a good chance
they went to my apartment...

55:10.726 --> 55:12.434
...where Angie has a lot of things.

55:12.602 --> 55:15.562
Her yearbooks, report cards,
her cell number is written...

55:15.730 --> 55:17.022
...and it's on my fridge.

55:17.190 --> 55:19.816
So they could then find this house.
They could come here.

55:19.984 --> 55:21.694
We should call the police
right away.

55:21.862 --> 55:23.946
We can't. The police
were the murderers.

55:24.114 --> 55:26.657
We can't call the police.
They were the murderers.

55:26.825 --> 55:29.494
Angie, I swear to God,
you do something or I'm gonna...

55:29.661 --> 55:31.746
- So fucked up.
- No. Don't let him "gonna."

55:31.914 --> 55:35.458
No, don't wanna. Look,
we gotta get the F out of here.

55:35.626 --> 55:38.252
Let's go. We need to begin
to prematurely evacuate.

55:38.420 --> 55:40.923
- Are you high?
- What? No. I'm not high. Why...?

55:41.091 --> 55:42.925
You are high as a fucking kite.

55:43.093 --> 55:44.551
I'm not high. Let's go.

55:44.719 --> 55:46.803
We're not going.
I'm coming back in a minute.

55:46.970 --> 55:49.222
You know what I'm coming back with?
With a gun.

55:49.390 --> 55:51.641
You better be out.
I'm not fucking with you.

55:51.809 --> 55:53.810
Your gun? His gun?

55:53.977 --> 55:56.437
Why do you...? Don't get a gun.
Why would he bear arms?

55:56.605 --> 56:00.608
No, we need to go.
Everyone, I'm leading the parade.

56:14.080 --> 56:18.625
I just want you to know,
I always got your back.

56:21.129 --> 56:23.505
And I'm glad we're partners.

56:29.971 --> 56:31.722
- This is so exciting.
- Okay, okay.

56:31.890 --> 56:34.016
Is this where you're parked?
Let's sally forth.

56:34.184 --> 56:35.601
Who is after you, after Angie?

56:35.769 --> 56:39.188
They're drug dealers. I have reason
to believe that they're drug dealers.

56:39.356 --> 56:41.816
What are you talking about?
You're out of your mind.

56:41.984 --> 56:44.402
- I know it sounds crazy.
- Hide.

56:44.570 --> 56:47.988
Dale! Dale! Dale! It's happening.
I was eating a Fruit Roll...

56:48.198 --> 56:49.448
- Why'd you do that?
- God!

56:49.616 --> 56:51.366
- Get it!
- Jesus! Okay! Just stop!

56:51.534 --> 56:54.786
- Angie, What did you do?
- He's one of the drug dealers!

56:54.953 --> 56:57.080
- He's my pot dealer.
- He's your pot dealer?

56:57.247 --> 56:58.372
- I got it.
- Get it.

57:00.877 --> 57:03.295
- Gross. Are you okay?
- Dale, who is this?

57:03.463 --> 57:06.465
- He's my... Oh, shit. Get down.
- Dad!

57:11.179 --> 57:12.429
What was that?

57:12.597 --> 57:14.681
That was a gunshot.

57:18.687 --> 57:20.563
Stop! Stop it! Stop it!

57:20.731 --> 57:22.690
- He's with me.
- I'm the good drug dealer.

57:22.858 --> 57:25.235
- Put the gun down!
- Put down the gun.

57:25.402 --> 57:27.152
You assholes
do exactly what I say...

57:27.320 --> 57:30.114
...or I will take you outside
and fuck you in the street.

57:30.281 --> 57:32.032
- No, don't.
- Don't fuck us anywhere.

57:38.248 --> 57:40.749
- Where's your gun?
- I don't need it.

57:40.917 --> 57:43.627
Kill motherfuckers With my hands.

57:45.004 --> 57:48.173
Get out your goddamn gun.
You're making me uncomfortable.

57:58.811 --> 58:00.769
Anybody out there?

58:03.773 --> 58:06.233
Fucking hide-and-seek.

58:06.401 --> 58:08.026
Say, now.

58:10.530 --> 58:12.906
Hey, the food's still warm.

58:15.952 --> 58:17.162
Love it.

58:17.329 --> 58:19.581
I found a bloody fork.

58:20.791 --> 58:23.375
It's fucking freaky, man.
They could still be here.

58:23.543 --> 58:25.794
Did you check the rest of the house?

58:26.838 --> 58:29.173
I'm about to check that bathroom,
I know that much.

58:29.340 --> 58:31.633
Come on, Saul. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

58:31.801 --> 58:34.302
Yes. We made it.
We're all safe, guys. We made it.

58:34.469 --> 58:35.803
- What are you doing?
- Get out.

58:35.971 --> 58:38.682
Get out of my car.
I can't believe you think it's an option.

58:38.850 --> 58:40.976
Okay. Okay. That makes sense.
It makes sense.

58:41.144 --> 58:43.270
Come on, let's go.
It makes sense. He's right.

58:43.438 --> 58:46.857
- Stay away from my family. Period.
- So where do we go? What do we do?

58:47.025 --> 58:49.359
Go to the Days Inn
downtown, okay?

58:49.527 --> 58:51.653
Use a fake name.

58:52.155 --> 58:54.156
Garagely. I'll contact you.

58:54.324 --> 58:57.327
I don't knowwho these people are,
what they're capable of...

58:57.494 --> 59:00.163
...but I Will keep you guys safe,
I promise that.

59:00.331 --> 59:01.664
Fuck off, loser.

59:03.626 --> 59:07.211
Angie, you're a fucking idiot.
I say that With love.

59:09.172 --> 59:11.547
Okay, you call this Mocha Milkshake.

59:11.715 --> 59:15.176
This one here, English Breeze.
Charge $40 for these.

59:15.345 --> 59:17.012
- Forty?
- Yeah.

59:17.180 --> 59:22.643
This one, Da Vinci's Brush.
Call this one Bumble Bush.

59:22.810 --> 59:26.772
And this here, Spanish Trampoline.

59:26.940 --> 59:29.191
Crazy With them names, ain't you, T?

59:29.359 --> 59:31.568
What the fuck is...?
What is it, Spanish...?

59:31.736 --> 59:34.279
Spanish Trampoline.
Used to call it Spanish Mudflaps...

59:34.447 --> 59:36.908
...but Troy likes to trampoline
so Spanish Trampoline.

59:37.076 --> 59:39.285
- Almost the same number of syllables.
- How much?

59:39.453 --> 59:41.536
- Forty-five for these last three.
- All right.

59:41.704 --> 59:44.414
- And leave me the best stash.
- All right.

59:44.582 --> 59:46.625
It's Pineapple Express.
Get your ass up.

59:46.793 --> 59:49.336
Yup, of course.

59:53.341 --> 59:54.384
So get this:

59:54.551 --> 59:56.135
We triangulated the cells.

59:56.303 --> 59:59.888
They smashed one, threw the other
in the woods to try to distract us.

01:00:00.056 --> 01:00:02.057
It took an hour for Jared to find it.

01:00:02.225 --> 01:00:04.935
And then he said
that he found Denton's car...

01:00:05.103 --> 01:00:07.479
...filled with all these
strange disguises.

01:00:07.647 --> 01:00:10.899
A powdered wig,
a sombrero, leotards.

01:00:11.067 --> 01:00:12.943
I mean, What the fuck
does that mean?

01:00:13.111 --> 01:00:15.612
Why don't I just call the Asians
and talk to Cheung?

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.073
Why beat around the bush,
you know?

01:00:29.669 --> 01:00:30.711
Hello?

01:00:30.878 --> 01:00:31.920
Cheung, it's Ted.

01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:33.381
Record this conversation.

01:00:34.008 --> 01:00:37.760
Ted, what a surprise.
What can I do for you?

01:00:37.928 --> 01:00:41.931
Well, Cheung, my friend,
let me tell you.

01:00:42.099 --> 01:00:46.018
You know, we both know
that you sent one of your very skilled...

01:00:46.185 --> 01:00:50.187
...hit men over here last night,
and I and my colleague...

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:53.525
...made a little decoration
on our window. Should have seen it.

01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:57.070
We painted the wall with his brain.
Painted it.

01:00:57.238 --> 01:01:00.907
And nowthis Dale Denton guy?
You serious?

01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:04.661
Just stop it, okay? Stop it or you're
asking for war. Do you want a war?

01:01:04.829 --> 01:01:06.079
- What?
- What?

01:01:06.247 --> 01:01:07.664
- Hello?
- Troy?

01:01:07.832 --> 01:01:12.420
Dad! Get off the phone. I told you
I'm gonna call some hot bitches later...

01:01:12.588 --> 01:01:15.089
...and this is the time.
- I got you your own line...

01:01:15.257 --> 01:01:17.508
...so you would stay off mine.
Get off the phone.

01:01:17.676 --> 01:01:21.136
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not a little kid, I'm a man!

01:01:21.304 --> 01:01:24.723
And from this point forward, I'm
not taking any of your fucking shit.

01:01:24.891 --> 01:01:29.186
I love you, Dad, but the dynamic
in our relationship is about to change.

01:01:29.354 --> 01:01:31.605
Troy, do me a favor,
get oft the fucking phone!

01:01:32.191 --> 01:01:35.317
- Shit.
- So you have a son.

01:01:35.485 --> 01:01:37.486
Sounds like a very nice boy.

01:01:37.653 --> 01:01:40.447
All right, you listen to me, Cheung,
you motherfucker!

01:01:40.615 --> 01:01:43.075
It is on! We're coming at you
with everything we got!

01:01:43.242 --> 01:01:45.786
It's on, so you better get your head
out of your ass...

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.621
...and be ready for everything!

01:01:47.789 --> 01:01:49.664
You are fucking dead!

01:01:50.792 --> 01:01:51.918
You are so dumb.

01:01:52.086 --> 01:01:55.587
Do you have any idea
how Weak you just made us look?

01:01:57.048 --> 01:02:00.133
Goddamn it!

01:02:00.468 --> 01:02:01.802
Totally sweet.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:04.513
Ted Jones is slipping.

01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:08.308
We shall strike now with full force.

01:02:09.477 --> 01:02:12.230
Your brother's death
will not be in vain.

01:02:14.775 --> 01:02:18.403
I gotta say, I've had, like,
a lot of weed dealers in my day.

01:02:18.570 --> 01:02:21.154
You're the coolest I've ever had.
They were all dicks.

01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:23.824
- Really? Thanks, man.
- No problem.

01:02:23.991 --> 01:02:26.451
I really appreciate it.
That means a lot to me.

01:02:26.619 --> 01:02:30.414
It's, like, you're the first guy that I ever
sold to that I became friends with.

01:02:30.581 --> 01:02:34.501
They say, like, "Don't dip the pen
in company ink."

01:02:34.669 --> 01:02:37.671
I'm totally glad
I dipped in your ink, bro.

01:02:38.881 --> 01:02:40.382
Yeah.

01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:45.679
We should get out of town.
That's probably our next move.

01:02:45.847 --> 01:02:47.514
Just get on a bus and leave, right?

01:02:48.391 --> 01:02:49.683
Get bus tickets.

01:02:49.851 --> 01:02:53.312
Go to the next town.
Contact some police.

01:02:53.480 --> 01:02:55.731
You know what I was saying?
Like, I'm totally...

01:02:55.899 --> 01:02:57.859
You're glad you dipped your pen
in my ink.

01:02:58.026 --> 01:03:00.194
But We should get bus tickets
and leave, right?

01:03:00.362 --> 01:03:01.571
What?

01:03:01.737 --> 01:03:04.865
Get on the bus? Leave?
Buy bus tickets?

01:03:05.032 --> 01:03:08.368
I only have, like, 50 bucks.
I don't think that'll even buy one ticket.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.245
What about your sack?

01:03:10.413 --> 01:03:13.290
Oh, man, it's fucking killing me.
I feel like I popped one.

01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.419
No. That's unfortunate,
but that's not what I'm talking about.

01:03:17.587 --> 01:03:19.045
I mean, like, the sack of weed.

01:03:19.213 --> 01:03:21.298
Couldn't we just,
like, sell some weed...

01:03:21.466 --> 01:03:23.133
...get some cash
and buy bus tickets?

01:03:23.301 --> 01:03:27.345
- Of course, man. That's what I do.
- That's what you do. Fucking A.

01:03:27.513 --> 01:03:30.308
Okay, so you're gonna buy tickets
for Saturday's game, right?

01:03:30.476 --> 01:03:32.059
These guys are amazing.

01:03:32.561 --> 01:03:33.936
What the fuck do you want?

01:03:34.104 --> 01:03:36.271
You guys wanna buy some chronic?

01:03:43.070 --> 01:03:44.571
What's this stuff called again?

01:03:44.739 --> 01:03:46.740
Pineapple Express.
They said it eight times.

01:03:46.908 --> 01:03:50.119
- Yeah, but don't call it that.
- Yeah, that's not what it's called.

01:03:50.287 --> 01:03:53.164
- Call it Banana Boat.
- Make sure you leave it at Weed too.

01:03:53.332 --> 01:03:56.250
This can be a gateway drug.
Don't wanna move on to other things.

01:03:56.418 --> 01:03:58.919
- Cocaine. Don't do that.
- We don't fuck around.

01:03:59.086 --> 01:04:03.131
- Don't worry. Don't tell us what to do.
- Inhale it, Chachi. Inhale it.

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:04.716
Who the fuck's Chachi?

01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.694
- How much money you guys gotu
- Come on.

01:04:24.862 --> 01:04:27.239
You each get as much
as you can grab with one hand.

01:04:27.407 --> 01:04:29.700
Go easy. That's a big handful, guys.
Come on.

01:04:29.868 --> 01:04:33.538
- Keep it on the down-low.
- Don't tell anybody where you got it.

01:04:33.705 --> 01:04:37.875
You got it from Saul... I mean, you got
it from Santiago and Dunbar.

01:04:38.043 --> 01:04:40.878
- Go. Come on.
- Go, go. Vamoose!

01:04:42.964 --> 01:04:44.047
You fucking did it, man.

01:04:44.215 --> 01:04:46.882
You are a good salesman.
You got it in you, man.

01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:49.469
I'm about to go get some
celebratory Slushees.

01:04:49.637 --> 01:04:51.137
Get some burritos or something.

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:53.306
Something to drink too.
Something good.

01:04:53.474 --> 01:04:55.892
See you, man. Nice.

01:05:02.108 --> 01:05:05.485
Don't move. Don't you move.
This shit hurts.

01:05:05.653 --> 01:05:07.280
Don't move. What's in your hand?

01:05:07.447 --> 01:05:09.198
It's Weed. It's a joint. It's a roach.

01:05:09.366 --> 01:05:11.075
- Right here.
- I was just smoking...

01:05:11.243 --> 01:05:13.786
I thought it was decriminalized,
to be honest with you.

01:05:13.954 --> 01:05:18.206
I have horrible anorexia,
and it helps my appetite. I'm so sorry.

01:05:18.374 --> 01:05:23.169
Look, selling narcotics to my students
is not decriminalized.

01:05:23.337 --> 01:05:26.340
- Okay. I understand.
- I'm the liaison officer for this school.

01:05:26.508 --> 01:05:29.594
And guess what? I just saw three
students Walking from back here...

01:05:29.761 --> 01:05:33.096
...with their eyes as red
as the devil's dick. You're busted.

01:05:39.312 --> 01:05:41.187
- On the hood. On the hood.
- Okay, okay.

01:05:41.355 --> 01:05:43.064
I'm on the hood. Come on.

01:05:43.232 --> 01:05:46.027
- Stand still. Stand still.
- I'm still. I'm sorry.

01:05:46.194 --> 01:05:49.904
You better hope it's clean.
Better hope ain't shit on this record.

01:05:50.072 --> 01:05:52.907
I'm gonna put my foot
up in your ass.

01:05:56.579 --> 01:05:59.039
Oh, big sexy with glasses.

01:06:01.334 --> 01:06:04.836
This is Ofticer Barbara. Requesting
an update on fugitive Dale Denton.

01:06:05.005 --> 01:06:09.550
I repeat, requesting update on Dale
Denton. I have the fugitive in custody.

01:06:09.718 --> 01:06:11.719
425, 425, what's your location?

01:06:13.263 --> 01:06:14.555
You going down.

01:06:14.723 --> 01:06:16.807
What? What do you mean...?
Why am I going down?

01:06:16.975 --> 01:06:19.226
What did that thing tell you?
What are you doing?

01:06:19.394 --> 01:06:21.645
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?

01:06:21.812 --> 01:06:24.313
I wasn't doing things.
Why do you hate me so much?

01:06:24.482 --> 01:06:26.900
Hit-and-run, Mr. Denton.
Hit-and-run.

01:06:27.068 --> 01:06:28.568
Two parked cars, tWo nights ago.

01:06:28.736 --> 01:06:30.779
One of them Was actually
a police cruiser.

01:06:30.946 --> 01:06:33.823
You gotta be the dumbest
motherfucker in captivity.

01:06:33.991 --> 01:06:36.868
It's the lady cop.
They got Dale. Oh, shit.

01:06:37.036 --> 01:06:38.912
So you're telling me
you saw Ted Jones...

01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.872
...and a police officer
shoot somebody?

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.540
- Exactly.
- And you sawit?

01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:44.710
- Yes, do you believe me?
- Give me a minute.

01:06:44.878 --> 01:06:47.713
- It was a Woman or a man?
- It was a policewoman. A woman.

01:06:47.881 --> 01:06:52.760
- I think I know who that bitch Was.
- Yes. I will identify that bitch.

01:06:54.721 --> 01:06:57.138
Thank you so much for believing me,
ma,am. Thank you.

01:06:57.306 --> 01:06:59.391
I'll tell you, I'll get to the bottom of it.

01:06:59.558 --> 01:07:01.810
I'll take this badge off,
get to the bottom of it.

01:07:01.977 --> 01:07:04.146
I don't work for the law.
The law Works for me.

01:07:04.314 --> 01:07:06.440
I been smelling something
in this department.

01:07:06.608 --> 01:07:07.942
Keep your eyes on the road.

01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:10.360
- Gonna get to the bottom of this shit.
- Stop!

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:12.946
Son of a bitch!

01:07:13.114 --> 01:07:16.950
Oh, no. What the hell was that?
What is that?

01:07:22.958 --> 01:07:26.711
No, no, no.

01:07:26.878 --> 01:07:29.880
- No. What are you doing?
- I'm saving you, amigo!

01:07:31.257 --> 01:07:33.299
Freeze, goddamn it!
Don't even think about it!

01:07:33.467 --> 01:07:36.052
This is an old-fashioned
escape mission, buddy.

01:07:36.220 --> 01:07:38.012
Stop this car!

01:07:41.642 --> 01:07:44.145
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:07:44.312 --> 01:07:45.730
Oh, shit!

01:07:48.316 --> 01:07:51.318
Oh, shit! It's the lady cop!
That's the murderer! Go!

01:07:51.486 --> 01:07:53.070
- That's the lady cop.
- Who's that?

01:07:53.238 --> 01:07:56.282
I don't know. They're shooting!

01:08:02.205 --> 01:08:04.164
Oh, my God, they're shooting!

01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:05.665
Fuck.

01:08:10.629 --> 01:08:12.172
Dude!

01:08:14.925 --> 01:08:16.509
I can't see! The Slushee!

01:08:16.677 --> 01:08:18.845
- Turn on the Wipers!
- It's not working!

01:08:19.013 --> 01:08:20.680
Well, kick out the window!

01:08:20.848 --> 01:08:23.601
- How do you drive with one foot?
- I don't know!

01:08:25.604 --> 01:08:27.480
Fuck! I think I pulled my groin!

01:08:30.859 --> 01:08:32.193
Get your foot out of there.

01:08:32.903 --> 01:08:35.029
She's gaining on us.
She's behind us.

01:08:35.197 --> 01:08:36.238
Her car's better.

01:08:36.406 --> 01:08:38.823
- Get your leg out of there. Seriously.
- I can't.

01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:41.869
Put it into maximum overdrive!

01:08:44.372 --> 01:08:46.456
Oh, no, no, no!

01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:49.793
Oh, shit!

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.669
Get it out!

01:08:54.089 --> 01:08:55.715
I can't see!

01:09:01.056 --> 01:09:05.476
Danger! Danger!
Trees! Tree, tree! Squirrel!

01:09:08.396 --> 01:09:09.980
Hey, I can see
through my leg hole.

01:09:10.148 --> 01:09:11.898
Nice! Look out! Tree, tree, tree!

01:09:14.610 --> 01:09:16.528
You did it, man.

01:09:17.822 --> 01:09:19.322
All right! Look out!

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:21.575
Oh, shit!

01:09:21.743 --> 01:09:24.161
Turn around! Turn around!

01:09:32.419 --> 01:09:34.254
I'm scared, Saul. I'm scared.

01:09:34.421 --> 01:09:36.756
- Don't worry. I'm handling this.
- Do something.

01:09:36.924 --> 01:09:39.175
All right, hold on. I got an idea.

01:09:42.681 --> 01:09:46.015
Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:09:46.934 --> 01:09:48.434
Sorry!

01:09:49.728 --> 01:09:51.312
What the fuck was that?

01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.731
Fuck. I'm sorry.
I thought she'd just go past.

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.775
- Why?
- I don't know.

01:10:12.794 --> 01:10:14.295
Oh, my.

01:10:18.759 --> 01:10:21.176
Yes! Yes! We made it!
All right, man.

01:10:21.344 --> 01:10:24.012
- Let's get the fuck out of here.
- No. What are you doing?

01:10:24.180 --> 01:10:26.973
You forgot me, you idiot!
Come back!

01:10:27.141 --> 01:10:30.018
Come back! Saul!

01:10:30.186 --> 01:10:31.520
- Sorry, man.
- Thank you.

01:10:31.687 --> 01:10:35.649
- Let's go.
- Wait. Get the handcuff keys, you idiot.

01:10:39.321 --> 01:10:40.780
I haven't used a gun since Uam.

01:10:40.948 --> 01:10:44.867
Angie, you have exhibited
poor decision-making skills.

01:10:45.035 --> 01:10:46.035
Oh, this is my fault.

01:10:46.203 --> 01:10:48.955
And we have hosted violence
in our home because of it.

01:10:49.123 --> 01:10:51.082
- "Hosted violence"?
- He's a bad guy.

01:10:51.250 --> 01:10:53.875
You don't see that
you have stooped way, way below...

01:10:54.043 --> 01:10:56.962
- You lowered your expectations...
...of what you are worthy of.

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:00.049
...but this guy is so far beneath you.
You deserve much better.

01:11:00.217 --> 01:11:02.218
Open your heart
to someone who deserves you.

01:11:02.386 --> 01:11:04.429
Or don't have a boyfriend
at all for a while.

01:11:04.596 --> 01:11:06.389
- We're stuck in this room.
- I love him.

01:11:06.557 --> 01:11:08.182
- It's not your decision.
- Love him?

01:11:08.349 --> 01:11:11.017
- You don't know What love is.
- I'm gonna date him.

01:11:11.185 --> 01:11:13.395
- We're going to the police.
- That's what I said.

01:11:13.563 --> 01:11:15.730
- I know.
- He said not to go to the police.

01:11:15.898 --> 01:11:18.317
- You should listen. He's a lawyer.
- You come with us.

01:11:18.485 --> 01:11:21.070
- He can't possibly work in law.
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:11:21.238 --> 01:11:22.405
- You stay.
- We're leaving.

01:11:22.573 --> 01:11:24.657
- You stay in the room.
- Fine, go. Fine, go.

01:11:24.825 --> 01:11:27.576
And we don't need the shampoos.
Why did...?

01:11:29.745 --> 01:11:32.998
As soon as we kill
those sacks of shit tonight, Ted...

01:11:33.166 --> 01:11:34.916
...l'm moving on.

01:11:39.173 --> 01:11:40.756
Okay.

01:11:40.924 --> 01:11:42.508
All right.

01:11:43.302 --> 01:11:46.762
And I promise you
you're gonna be taken care of.

01:11:46.930 --> 01:11:48.222
As sure as shit you will.

01:11:48.390 --> 01:11:50.183
For now, this is what
we're gonna do.

01:11:50.350 --> 01:11:53.853
We're gonna go to the farm tonight,
we're gonna move tonight's shipment.

01:11:54.021 --> 01:11:56.606
Then tomorrow morning,
we're gonna hunt these guys down.

01:11:56.773 --> 01:11:59.274
Dale, Saul, the Asians.
Every last one of them.

01:11:59.442 --> 01:12:01.610
We're gonna fucking kill them all.

01:12:02.111 --> 01:12:03.820
So smile.

01:12:03.988 --> 01:12:05.572
Shut up.

01:12:07.992 --> 01:12:12.329
Say something in Spanish.
Go ahead. I dare you. Go ahead.

01:12:13.705 --> 01:12:15.498
All right. Are you using protection?

01:12:15.666 --> 01:12:16.749
- Days Inn.
- Yes.

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.793
May I have the Garagely room,
please?

01:12:19.628 --> 01:12:21.546
- Hello?
- Hello, is Angie there?

01:12:21.714 --> 01:12:23.548
- Dale.
- Angie?

01:12:23.716 --> 01:12:26.426
- My God, are you okay?
- I'm good. I'm fine. I'm great.

01:12:26.593 --> 01:12:27.927
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

01:12:28.095 --> 01:12:29.679
Okay, good. I came up with a plan.

01:12:29.847 --> 01:12:32.015
It might sound weird at first,
but just listen.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:35.059
Dale. You know what? Drug dealers...
Let me tell you something.

01:12:35.227 --> 01:12:40.148
Drug dealers are trying to kill me.
And you. And my family.

01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:43.192
I can't believe I'm in this situation
right now because of you...

01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:46.236
...and your addiction to marijuana.
I cannot believe I'm here.

01:12:46.404 --> 01:12:47.946
I can't be addicted to marijuana.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:51.283
A, I use a bong. It filters out
the addictive shit. Seriously.

01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:54.327
B, what does that have to do with
anything? I witnessed murder.

01:12:54.496 --> 01:12:55.788
And nowI'm dealing With it.

01:12:55.956 --> 01:12:58.458
This, that's happening between us,
this is normal.

01:12:58.625 --> 01:13:01.127
This happens to every couple
dating for three months.

01:13:01.295 --> 01:13:02.795
- We have to work through it.
- No.

01:13:02.963 --> 01:13:04.422
This doesn't happen to anyone.

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:07.049
I should not be in this situation,
so fuck you.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.550
You know what? It's over.

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.219
Good. Fine. Whatever. It's over.

01:13:11.387 --> 01:13:14.724
Congratulations. Sad to happen
sometime, right? Why not now?

01:13:14.892 --> 01:13:16.225
What the fuck does that mean?

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:19.062
It means that you are gonna go
to college next year.

01:13:19.229 --> 01:13:21.314
You'll get into
Godspeed Nou! Black Emperor...

01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:22.648
...and the fucking Shins.

01:13:22.816 --> 01:13:25.401
And you'll blow a bunch of dudes
and become a lesbian...

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:28.279
...and I'll be here in fucking
Clark County doing shit-all.

01:13:28.447 --> 01:13:30.865
You're gonna dump me.
So, fuck it, have a good time.

01:13:31.033 --> 01:13:33.116
A lesbian? Fuck you, Dale!

01:13:33.284 --> 01:13:35.036
You never did like me anyway,
did you?

01:13:35.204 --> 01:13:36.746
You didn't wanna meet my parents.

01:13:36.914 --> 01:13:39.498
I always cared about you.
That's not what this is. Okay?

01:13:39.665 --> 01:13:40.916
I always care about you.

01:13:41.084 --> 01:13:42.918
Why don't you ever act like it, huh?

01:13:43.086 --> 01:13:45.504
Why do you never act
like you care about anything?

01:13:45.671 --> 01:13:49.800
Because I'm high! Fuck! And it...
What do you want...? Okay. Jesus.

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.010
Call me when I can go home.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:57.433
You lost it playing Bid Whist?
You pimp.

01:13:57.601 --> 01:14:00.812
No, I'll give you more,
but you cannot gamble with it.

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:03.689
I know, I'm sorry about the clocks.

01:14:03.857 --> 01:14:07.985
I couldn't remember if it was today
or tomorrow. All right, I gotta go.

01:14:08.153 --> 01:14:09.695
I love you.

01:14:09.863 --> 01:14:12.031
You wise-ass.

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:15.618
Hey, you all right, man?
That sounded pretty hectic.

01:14:15.786 --> 01:14:18.204
I'm okay.
Let's just get the fuck out of here.

01:14:18.372 --> 01:14:19.455
First things first.

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:24.835
- Don't do that, okay?
- Yeah. Why not?

01:14:25.002 --> 01:14:27.170
Why not? Car chase, gunshots.

01:14:27.338 --> 01:14:28.797
That clearly just happened...

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:31.299
...because we were smoking
marijuana.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.469
No, man. It happened
because those kids...

01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:35.805
...couldn't keep their shit
on the down-low.

01:14:35.973 --> 01:14:38.808
In case you haven't noticed...
Which you haven't.

01:14:38.976 --> 01:14:41.477
From what I can tell,
you don't notice anything ever.

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:44.981
- We are not very functional when
we're high. Which is all the time.

01:14:45.149 --> 01:14:47.899
Well, I don't know, man.
I think I'm functioning right now.

01:14:48.067 --> 01:14:50.902
I was, like, stoned when I saved you
with those Slushees.

01:14:51.070 --> 01:14:52.488
What do you gotta say to that?

01:14:52.656 --> 01:14:55.241
Well, that would be true
if you had saved me.

01:14:55.409 --> 01:14:56.534
But you didn't save me.

01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:58.619
She was gonna help,
you made things Worse.

01:14:58.787 --> 01:15:00.663
We're wanted
for all sorts of crazy shit.

01:15:00.831 --> 01:15:02.832
Don't fucking get on my case,
all right?

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.667
Only reason I started selling pot...

01:15:04.835 --> 01:15:07.420
...is so I could put my bubbe
in a nice retirement home.

01:15:07.588 --> 01:15:09.754
- She must be proud of you.
- She is proud of me.

01:15:09.922 --> 01:15:11.257
I'm gonna become something.

01:15:11.425 --> 01:15:13.968
As soon as she dies,
I'm gonna become a civil engineer.

01:15:14.136 --> 01:15:16.470
I'm gonna design septic tanks
for playgrounds.

01:15:16.638 --> 01:15:18.139
Little kids can take shits.

01:15:18.307 --> 01:15:19.931
You idiot. What the hell do you do?

01:15:20.099 --> 01:15:22.184
What am I gonna do?
Besides stay in my home...

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:24.936
...for fear that you've designed
some object I'm around?

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:28.315
I'm gonna be on the radio,
talking about life.

01:15:28.482 --> 01:15:30.902
- Giving lessons about life.
- Put me in my place.

01:15:31.069 --> 01:15:33.571
I'm gonna be designing buildings
and what's he doing?

01:15:33.739 --> 01:15:35.573
Boring people to death on the radio.

01:15:35.741 --> 01:15:39.368
You are an asshole.
That's all you are. You're an asshole.

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:41.370
- I'm not an asshole.
- You are an asshole.

01:15:41.538 --> 01:15:44.540
I feel pretty sure
that I'm not an asshole.

01:15:44.708 --> 01:15:46.334
I'm, like, a totally nice guy.

01:15:46.501 --> 01:15:49.003
I'm just as nice as you are.
So don't bring that out.

01:15:49.171 --> 01:15:50.964
In the woods, I gave you my jacket.

01:15:51.132 --> 01:15:53.467
You were cold and I clothed you.

01:15:53.926 --> 01:15:57.219
Now about in the park
when I said that you were my friend?

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:59.054
You didn't say anything back.

01:15:59.222 --> 01:16:01.765
Well, that's easy.
It's because we're not friends.

01:16:01.933 --> 01:16:03.391
You are my drug dealer.

01:16:03.559 --> 01:16:05.310
There's one reason
we know each other.

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:07.520
I like the drugs you sell. That's it.

01:16:07.688 --> 01:16:10.900
If you didn't sell those drugs,
I would have no idea who you Were...

01:16:11.068 --> 01:16:14.237
...and I would be fantastic right now.
Instead of looking like this.

01:16:16.198 --> 01:16:19.200
That sounded mean.
Just hearing it sounded mean.

01:16:19.368 --> 01:16:20.910
- I didn't mean to say...
- It's out.

01:16:21.078 --> 01:16:23.537
Monkey's out of the bottle, man.

01:16:23.705 --> 01:16:25.748
What? That's not even
an expression.

01:16:25.916 --> 01:16:28.625
Pandora doesn't go back in the box.
He only comes out.

01:16:28.793 --> 01:16:30.670
I'm sorry, man. Look...

01:16:31.129 --> 01:16:34.632
- What are you doing?
- Here. Have a nice last meal.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:37.385
Come on, man. Don't do that.

01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:39.637
Why don't you supersize it, bitch?

01:16:39.805 --> 01:16:42.223
I'm sorry, man. Look, come back.

01:16:42.391 --> 01:16:44.599
I didn't mean that.

01:16:57.030 --> 01:16:59.782
I love you. Do you love me?

01:17:42.783 --> 01:17:44.409
That looks great.

01:17:52.044 --> 01:17:53.502
Hello?

01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:55.880
Dale?

01:17:56.048 --> 01:17:57.423
It is Dale.

01:17:57.591 --> 01:18:02.470
Angie, I'm calling because I love you
more than anything in the World...

01:18:02.637 --> 01:18:06.057
...and I wanna let you know
I'll do anything to make it work.

01:18:06.224 --> 01:18:07.975
I'll do anything.

01:18:08.143 --> 01:18:11.729
I've had a near-death experience,
and when that happens...

01:18:11.897 --> 01:18:14.607
...you can prioritize your life,
and you are it, okay?

01:18:14.775 --> 01:18:16.942
So please
just take me back, please.

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:19.195
- I love you.
- I love you.

01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:23.531
- Yeah?
- I just don't wanna lose you, Dale.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:27.161
We were driving away from the house
and I just kept thinking...

01:18:27.329 --> 01:18:28.537
I don't know. I just...

01:18:28.705 --> 01:18:30.122
I wanna marry you.

01:18:33.210 --> 01:18:34.877
I made a mistake.

01:18:35.045 --> 01:18:37.380
- What do you mean?
- I've...

01:18:37.798 --> 01:18:40.216
- What?
- I'm just processing that last bit.

01:18:40.384 --> 01:18:42.967
- You wanna... Oh, fuck.
- What?

01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:44.719
I don't know.

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:47.014
I realize now
that if you would take me back...

01:18:47.182 --> 01:18:49.100
...then you are very naive
and immature.

01:18:49.267 --> 01:18:52.853
You don't see what a fuck-up I am.
I'm in no shape to be dated by anyone.

01:18:53.021 --> 01:18:56.148
- You're the one that's immature.
- I'm not immature. You're immature.

01:18:56.316 --> 01:18:59.527
I am somewhat immature,
but you're more immature. I'm older.

01:18:59.694 --> 01:19:00.986
Just because you're older.

01:19:01.154 --> 01:19:03.697
I lost my virginity
when I was 14 years old.

01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:06.034
- Really?
- How many girls have you slept with?

01:19:06.202 --> 01:19:08.285
- Like, two and a half.
- Two and a half?

01:19:08.453 --> 01:19:09.662
What is a half? Your hand?

01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:12.748
No, it was the tip or I dipped a ball in.
I can't remember why.

01:19:12.916 --> 01:19:15.583
I remember thinking,
"This doesn't count as a full point."

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:18.128
If I said three, I'd feel like a liar.
I was drunk.

01:19:18.295 --> 01:19:19.629
Screw you.

01:19:19.797 --> 01:19:20.964
Get me out of this room.

01:19:21.132 --> 01:19:24.217
I will, and that's the last
you'll ever hear from me, okay?

01:19:26.388 --> 01:19:30.182
Oh, thank goodness. Okay.

01:19:33.395 --> 01:19:35.688
Belogus. Faye Belogus.

01:19:37.107 --> 01:19:38.441
Lookit there. Lookit there.

01:19:38.608 --> 01:19:40.443
Do you use the pool over here?

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.362
Yes, I use the pool. Come on,
what do you want from me?

01:19:43.530 --> 01:19:46.741
Your grandson. We need you to get
on the phone with your grandson...

01:19:46.909 --> 01:19:48.826
What are you talking about,
my grandson?

01:19:48.994 --> 01:19:51.745
You told me you wanna sit down,
play dominos with me.

01:19:51.913 --> 01:19:53.914
And nowyou're hocking me
about my grandson.

01:19:54.082 --> 01:19:56.749
- Is that Yiddish?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

01:19:56.917 --> 01:19:58.042
May I call you Faye?

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.337
You can call me Faye,
but I'm gonna call you a stinker.

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:03.047
Hey, Mrs. Mendelson.

01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:04.758
What do you want from me?

01:20:04.926 --> 01:20:06.302
Bubbe. Hey, guys.

01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:08.971
- Well, look who it is.
- Hello, baby.

01:20:13.059 --> 01:20:14.101
Damn.

01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:16.353
Oh, shit.

01:20:16.521 --> 01:20:18.147
Sorry, Betty.

01:20:22.526 --> 01:20:24.904
They kidnapped my grandson.

01:20:25.071 --> 01:20:26.989
Yeah, these tWo guys came in...

01:20:27.157 --> 01:20:30.159
...they sat down with me
to play dominos.

01:20:30.327 --> 01:20:32.411
I never saw them in my life before.

01:20:32.579 --> 01:20:35.748
And they kept asking questions
about my grandson.

01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:40.377
- What did they look like?
- One of them was very tall and sloppy.

01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:44.340
And the other guy,
he was very good-looking...

01:20:44.508 --> 01:20:45.841
...but he was short as shit.

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:47.927
But the Worst part was...

01:20:48.094 --> 01:20:52.473
...that my grandson came in,
why, and in pajamas.

01:20:52.641 --> 01:20:54.642
- You gotta find my grandson.
- Do the best...

01:20:54.809 --> 01:20:56.059
- Do you promise?
- I promise.

01:20:56.227 --> 01:20:58.102
Absolutely.
You've got something there.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:59.812
I believe that's a mole, ma,am.

01:21:05.487 --> 01:21:08.697
You sack of shit. Do you know
what a pain in the ass you've been?

01:21:08.865 --> 01:21:10.616
No, man. I don't wanna get out.

01:21:10.784 --> 01:21:13.619
Who gave you that lollipop?
Let's go.

01:21:13.787 --> 01:21:15.996
Where am I, man? What?

01:21:16.164 --> 01:21:19.625
You guys started it, man.
I don't even wanna be here.

01:21:19.793 --> 01:21:21.126
Shit. Did I do that?

01:21:22.797 --> 01:21:25.799
Hey, hey. All right, okay.

01:21:26.425 --> 01:21:28.301
Fuck you, man!

01:21:28.469 --> 01:21:31.178
- Stand back. Ted wants him alive.
- Why you holding me back?

01:21:31.346 --> 01:21:32.679
Ted wants him alive, okay?

01:21:32.846 --> 01:21:34.847
I should be kicking
his fucking teeth in.

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:38.393
- If anybody's gonna beat him, it's Ted.
- I look like hamburglar.

01:21:38.561 --> 01:21:39.602
And the Elephant Man.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:41.981
Like someone fucked you up
with a coffee pot.

01:21:42.148 --> 01:21:43.899
Professional. Professional.

01:21:44.067 --> 01:21:46.193
- Professional on this, bitch.
- Whatever, man.

01:21:46.361 --> 01:21:48.487
- Where were you?
- I was there.

01:21:48.655 --> 01:21:50.531
- Supposed to be my partner.
- I was there.

01:21:50.699 --> 01:21:52.366
No, you wasn't.
How did this happen?

01:21:52.534 --> 01:21:54.743
I take the hit?
That's how it's gonna be?

01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:57.288
Fuck all this, you know?
Get him out of here.

01:21:57.455 --> 01:22:00.709
Take him downstairs.
Get this asshole out of my sight.

01:22:00.876 --> 01:22:03.043
I don't wanna go near this guy.

01:22:03.211 --> 01:22:06.171
What's down there?
Fucking rancor?

01:22:06.339 --> 01:22:07.965
I might act tough...

01:22:08.133 --> 01:22:10.217
...but I got a lot of feelings.

01:22:10.594 --> 01:22:13.512
And you hurt damn near
every one of them.

01:22:14.556 --> 01:22:16.265
This ain't over.

01:22:16.725 --> 01:22:18.601
- You know you gonna die, right?
- Yeah.

01:22:18.768 --> 01:22:20.811
I'm gonna kill the fuck out of you.

01:22:20.979 --> 01:22:24.273
I hope you enjoy these last
17 minutes of your life...

01:22:24.441 --> 01:22:26.692
...because when Ted gets here,
he's gonna be like:

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:29.945
"Kill that motherfucker."
I'm gonna kill your motherfucking ass.

01:22:30.113 --> 01:22:31.113
Watch your head.

01:22:33.074 --> 01:22:34.867
Hey, watch him.

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:37.952
Oh, my God.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.456
El Dorado.

01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:43.000
The legends are true.

01:22:43.627 --> 01:22:45.794
Look at all this weed, man.

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:47.713
What's that? Purple Granddaddy?

01:22:47.881 --> 01:22:50.257
- Come on.
- Purple Nurple?

01:22:50.425 --> 01:22:52.217
OG Kush?

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:53.719
OG Kush.

01:23:00.895 --> 01:23:03.521
It's the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

01:23:03.689 --> 01:23:05.357
- What kind of irrigation...?
- Shut up.

01:23:05.524 --> 01:23:07.441
- Can I touch it?
- Come here.

01:23:22.832 --> 01:23:24.625
Hello?

01:23:24.793 --> 01:23:26.168
Red?

01:23:32.342 --> 01:23:34.259
- Red?
- What the fuck?

01:23:34.427 --> 01:23:37.221
Get out of here, man.
I didn't do shit, Denton.

01:23:37.389 --> 01:23:40.517
Look, I come in peace, okay?
I'm not here to fight you again.

01:23:40.685 --> 01:23:42.102
Good.

01:23:42.269 --> 01:23:45.020
Because I'm tired, man.
Not feeling so hot.

01:23:45.188 --> 01:23:47.022
You don't look great.

01:23:47.190 --> 01:23:48.732
They shot me, Denton.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.192
They got me right here.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.694
- Yeah?
- Right here.

01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:53.696
And then they got me again
right here.

01:23:53.863 --> 01:23:57.073
Look, man, I'll call 911 right now.

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:58.784
They'll save your life, okay?

01:23:58.952 --> 01:24:00.869
- You don't need to die.
- No, bro.

01:24:01.037 --> 01:24:03.664
You don't get it.
It doesn't really matter where I'm at.

01:24:03.832 --> 01:24:06.083
If I'm at the hospital, if I'm here...

01:24:06.251 --> 01:24:08.377
...Ted's gonna find me, man.
He will.

01:24:08.545 --> 01:24:11.463
And when he does,
he's gonna fucking kill me.

01:24:11.631 --> 01:24:13.257
He's just, like, an asshole.

01:24:13.425 --> 01:24:16.385
I couldn't agree more, Red.
That's why I've come here, okay?

01:24:16.553 --> 01:24:18.387
You know Ted? He took Saul.

01:24:18.555 --> 01:24:19.930
And I'm gonna get him back.

01:24:20.098 --> 01:24:22.099
You know, like, he saved my life.

01:24:22.267 --> 01:24:25.394
We've been on the run together.
He's a great friend. A good guy.

01:24:25.562 --> 01:24:28.397
He is. I'll tell you that, man.
Saul is a good dude.

01:24:28.565 --> 01:24:29.648
I was mean to him, man.

01:24:29.816 --> 01:24:32.568
I wronged him and I can't...
I can't let it end like that.

01:24:32.736 --> 01:24:36.405
I'm just into Buddhism
and I'm at peace with the fact...

01:24:36.573 --> 01:24:40.452
...that me as this person,
probably gonna not be around.

01:24:40.619 --> 01:24:42.579
Think about a hermit crab, okay?

01:24:42.747 --> 01:24:46.707
And it's a shell, and it's like
they go from one shell to the next.

01:24:46.875 --> 01:24:51.002
And that's what I am. It's like
I'm just a hermit crab changing shells.

01:24:51.170 --> 01:24:53.546
Except, if you're a dick
your whole life...

01:24:53.714 --> 01:24:56.592
...your next shell
will be made of shit, okay?

01:24:56.760 --> 01:24:59.511
If you're an asshole, you're gonna
come back as a cockroach.

01:24:59.679 --> 01:25:03.432
Or a Worm,
or a fucking anal bead, okay?

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.976
If you're a man,
and you act heroic...

01:25:06.144 --> 01:25:07.728
...you'll come back as an eagle.

01:25:07.896 --> 01:25:09.438
You'll come back as a dragon.

01:25:09.606 --> 01:25:11.273
You'll come back as Jude Law.

01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:14.276
Okay? Which would you rather be?

01:25:14.444 --> 01:25:17.781
Maybe the anal bead. Might...
Depending on who it belongs to.

01:25:17.948 --> 01:25:18.990
It belongs to me.

01:25:19.158 --> 01:25:20.617
- Then the dragon.
- Exactly.

01:25:20.785 --> 01:25:24.620
You need to help me, okay?
Just use it, you know? Use the pain.

01:25:24.788 --> 01:25:25.996
You'll have a second wind.

01:25:26.164 --> 01:25:28.582
Let's get up
and go get Saul back. Use it.

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:31.417
- Aren't you angry at Ted?
- Yeah, I'm really mad at him.

01:25:31.585 --> 01:25:34.754
What do you wanna do? Don't you
wanna get up, do something about it?

01:25:34.922 --> 01:25:37.216
Maybe that would be cool
to do to him.

01:25:37.383 --> 01:25:39.051
I don't think "maybe" is the answer.

01:25:39.219 --> 01:25:41.512
I think, "Yes, I'm gonna
help you, Dale"...

01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:43.472
...that's the answer I'm looking for.

01:25:45.099 --> 01:25:46.475
Come here.

01:25:49.646 --> 01:25:53.357
Ted Jones messed
with the wrong melon farmers.

01:25:55.820 --> 01:25:57.903
Thug life.

01:26:03.868 --> 01:26:05.118
Oh, shit.

01:26:05.286 --> 01:26:07.996
Get those. I don't wanna
run them over in the vacuum...

01:26:08.164 --> 01:26:10.249
...and shoot my face off, okay?
- I'm sorry.

01:26:17.216 --> 01:26:19.925
I used to use this little gun
when I was a prostitute.

01:26:24.931 --> 01:26:28.016
Don't.

01:26:28.184 --> 01:26:29.852
Just something quick like that.

01:26:30.019 --> 01:26:31.519
- Don't.
- Yeah.

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:33.856
- Don't. You stop it right now.
- Stop it.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:48.954
Oh, God.

01:26:51.624 --> 01:26:53.710
That's a big hideout.

01:26:55.629 --> 01:26:57.672
I can't do this. I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.800
I'm infected. My shit's all fucked up.
I need medical attention.

01:27:00.968 --> 01:27:03.887
What? I thought we just got all
pumped up. What was that about?

01:27:04.054 --> 01:27:06.471
Ted is a fucking murderer.
I can't fuck with him.

01:27:06.639 --> 01:27:08.723
I got a wife.
She's gonna be out of jail soon.

01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:11.809
I wanna fuck her. I am not gonna
wake up murdered tomorrow.

01:27:11.977 --> 01:27:14.146
Oh, man, no.
This is lame of you, man.

01:27:14.314 --> 01:27:16.690
Come on. This could be
your moment of redemption.

01:27:16.858 --> 01:27:18.066
This could be your moment.

01:27:18.234 --> 01:27:20.777
I don't want a moment.
I don't want... Fine, go.

01:27:20.945 --> 01:27:21.987
Fuck you.

01:27:22.155 --> 01:27:24.323
Please come back for me.
Please come back.

01:27:24.490 --> 01:27:28.702
Legends never die, dude.
I'll tell your story.

01:27:29.412 --> 01:27:32.248
Carol, she's cool now.

01:27:32.416 --> 01:27:36.377
Carol used to be a little crazy, man.
She used to throw tickle parties.

01:27:36.545 --> 01:27:38.837
- Sounds like home-cooking to me.
- That was fun.

01:27:39.005 --> 01:27:41.423
Game over, motherfuckers!
Everybody freeze!

01:27:41.591 --> 01:27:43.884
Tell me where my friend is
or this guy gets it!

01:27:44.052 --> 01:27:46.261
All right, everybody be cool, man.
Be cool.

01:27:46.429 --> 01:27:47.971
Put your guns down.
Nobody shoots.

01:27:48.139 --> 01:27:49.765
Put them down. On the ground.

01:27:49.933 --> 01:27:52.268
All right, everybody just chill.

01:27:52.436 --> 01:27:54.354
Oh, my God!

01:27:54.521 --> 01:27:56.188
- You shot him.
- Put the gun down.

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.899
- Drop the fucking gun.
- Don't shoot me!

01:27:59.067 --> 01:28:01.360
- Holy shit.
- I said, nobody shoot. You shot Pete.

01:28:01.527 --> 01:28:03.320
That's right. I shot him. I shot him.

01:28:03.488 --> 01:28:06.239
I shot him. I don't have time
for a fucking negotiation.

01:28:06.407 --> 01:28:08.909
Now, I wanna finish this off
so I can go home...

01:28:09.077 --> 01:28:10.994
...and have dinner
with my wife for once.

01:28:11.163 --> 01:28:13.288
If anybody asks, Denton killed Pete.

01:28:13.456 --> 01:28:15.290
End of story.

01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:17.459
I'm telling Ted.

01:28:17.627 --> 01:28:19.419
- If you do...
- He's got a piece.

01:28:19.587 --> 01:28:21.171
- Motherfucker.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

01:28:21.339 --> 01:28:23.006
He's got another one, in the side.

01:28:23.174 --> 01:28:24.800
Damn it. I got one more on my leg.

01:28:24.968 --> 01:28:27.219
There's one more.
I know you'll find it. Take it.

01:28:27.387 --> 01:28:29.554
I'm sorry, guys.
Sorry I deceived you.

01:28:29.722 --> 01:28:30.974
No. Come on.

01:28:34.019 --> 01:28:36.479
- Oh, great.
- Saul.

01:28:36.647 --> 01:28:37.772
- Dale.
- Yes.

01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:41.109
What did you do, rat me out?
Is that what you did, you bastard?

01:28:41.276 --> 01:28:43.151
- No, man.
- Yes.

01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:44.987
I'm here to save you.

01:28:45.154 --> 01:28:47.822
No. You just got caught too.

01:28:47.990 --> 01:28:50.367
And I'm gonna die in here
with some asshole.

01:28:50.535 --> 01:28:52.619
Okay, you know what?
I deserved that.

01:28:52.787 --> 01:28:55.622
I'll take that because
I have been an asshole, man.

01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:58.959
This whole thing is my fault.
I ruined your life.

01:28:59.335 --> 01:29:02.337
Okay? And I know there's no way...

01:29:02.505 --> 01:29:04.923
...to make that up to you
except by saving your life.

01:29:05.091 --> 01:29:08.176
So that's What I came here to do.
I'm here to save my best friend.

01:29:08.344 --> 01:29:10.847
Because that's what you are.
You're my best friend.

01:29:11.015 --> 01:29:12.765
You're a mean jerk.

01:29:12.933 --> 01:29:15.893
I was mean.
I was mean because, I think...

01:29:16.061 --> 01:29:18.312
I didn't Want
you to be my best friend.

01:29:18.480 --> 01:29:21.189
I didn't Wanna think
that that's what my life was.

01:29:21.357 --> 01:29:23.817
Now I realize I'm lucky
to have you as my best friend.

01:29:23.985 --> 01:29:25.485
You're the best guy I know.

01:29:26.195 --> 01:29:27.487
BFFF.

01:29:27.655 --> 01:29:30.074
Best fucking friends forever, man.
Seriously.

01:29:33.411 --> 01:29:35.620
- All right. Give me a hug.
- Yeah. Okay.

01:29:35.788 --> 01:29:38.206
Thanks, man.
I'm so sorry about everything.

01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:39.708
Oh, I'm such a dick.

01:29:39.876 --> 01:29:43.045
- Okay. I'm gonna get us out.
- No, you're not, but it's okay.

01:29:43.212 --> 01:29:46.089
These guys are gonna fucking kill us.
We gotta get out of here.

01:29:46.257 --> 01:29:48.008
- I know. They are.
- Fuck, man.

01:29:48.176 --> 01:29:52.512
We can hear you outside and
it's very fucking annoying, all right?

01:29:52.680 --> 01:29:55.223
- Okay. Sorry about that, sir.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:29:55.391 --> 01:29:57.559
Do you know
what "shut the fuck up" mean?

01:29:57.727 --> 01:29:59.227
I do.

01:29:59.395 --> 01:30:01.188
Shit. Stupid motherfuckers.

01:30:01.939 --> 01:30:05.275
Yes. Okay. I got an idea. I got an idea.
My belt buckle. My belt buckle.

01:30:05.443 --> 01:30:08.905
Right here. Okay? Rub your wrists
against my belt buckle. That'll do it.

01:30:10.282 --> 01:30:11.908
- Is it Working?
- I can't feel it.

01:30:12.076 --> 01:30:13.076
I can't feel you.

01:30:13.243 --> 01:30:15.203

- Let me save you.
- Save me, Dale.

01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:23.001
It's not Working.
We gotta change angles.

01:30:23.169 --> 01:30:25.420
We gotta
get more leverage-y. Okay.

01:30:25.588 --> 01:30:27.088
Okay, that's good. That's good.

01:30:27.255 --> 01:30:29.174
Get your hands up on it.
There we go.

- You're my best friend, man.
- Yeah, see?

01:30:39.894 --> 01:30:42.979
- It's not working.
- Let me use my... I'll use my mouth.

01:30:43.147 --> 01:30:45.107
Finish it off with my mouth, pal.
Let's go.

01:30:45.274 --> 01:30:47.401
Come on. Let's go.

01:30:47.569 --> 01:30:49.445
Harder.

01:30:58.038 --> 01:31:00.455
- Where are these fuckers?
- We got them downstairs.

01:31:00.623 --> 01:31:03.291
- Where did you find them?
- Found Saul at his grandmother's.

01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:06.378
He fucked up Matheson's face.
Hit him with a pot of hot coffee.

01:31:06.546 --> 01:31:07.963
It's gross.

01:31:08.131 --> 01:31:10.423
Dale Denton comes flying in here
like a madman...

01:31:10.591 --> 01:31:14.386
...armed to the teeth, and,
as you can see, he shot Peter.

01:31:14.554 --> 01:31:16.763
Plugged him, just whacked him.

01:31:16.931 --> 01:31:20.142
How they're both disarmed
and they're downstairs.

01:31:20.309 --> 01:31:21.893
He shot Pete?

01:31:22.061 --> 01:31:24.062
Fucking Pete? He was ex-CIA.

01:31:24.230 --> 01:31:26.774
Who the fuck is this Dale Denton?

01:31:26.942 --> 01:31:30.236
Who is he? Where did he come from?
I do not know.

01:31:34.782 --> 01:31:36.825
Time to cook shit up tonight.

01:31:36.993 --> 01:31:39.035
Take his stash and burn
this motherfucker down.

01:31:40.413 --> 01:31:42.330
Stop. Wait here.

01:31:42.498 --> 01:31:45.250
No retreat, no surrender.

01:31:50.716 --> 01:31:51.757
Yes, yes, yes.

01:31:51.925 --> 01:31:54.759
- Wait, someone's coming.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:31:54.927 --> 01:31:58.346
If I cough once, I'll take the lead.
If I cough twice, you go, okay?

01:31:58.514 --> 01:32:00.682
Well... I cough sometimes for real.

01:32:00.850 --> 01:32:02.767
Just don't. Don't...

01:32:08.357 --> 01:32:11.443
Yo, look. I'm gonna say this
one time.

01:32:11.611 --> 01:32:15.697
Whatever you're doing,
I get it, okay?

01:32:15.865 --> 01:32:17.365
Stop.

01:32:20.745 --> 01:32:23.330
See, I don't think
you understood me.

01:32:23.497 --> 01:32:25.333
I can hear everything you're saying.

01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:28.211
One cough mean you go.
Two cough mean you take the lead.

01:32:28.378 --> 01:32:30.880
The belt buckle.
Best friends forever.

01:32:31.048 --> 01:32:33.299
Y,all fuck on your own time, man.

01:32:33.467 --> 01:32:35.051
Sorry, man. It was a stupid plan.

01:32:35.219 --> 01:32:37.637
What the fuck is that?

01:32:39.932 --> 01:32:40.972
Dale!

01:32:45.102 --> 01:32:48.521
I've been Waiting for this.
You burned my face!

01:32:50.816 --> 01:32:53.151
I'm gonna tear this ass up.

01:32:59.659 --> 01:33:01.159
You shot me.

01:33:01.327 --> 01:33:02.702
I'm sorry, man.

01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:06.582
I've never been shot.
Damn, that hurt.

01:33:06.750 --> 01:33:08.376
I got glass in my ass.

01:33:08.543 --> 01:33:11.128
- Dale. Dale!
- This is messed up.

01:33:11.296 --> 01:33:13.422
Has anyone seen my bigger knife?

01:33:15.758 --> 01:33:17.801
Asians!

01:33:22.765 --> 01:33:23.766
War is upon you!

01:33:23.934 --> 01:33:25.768
Prepare to suck the cock of karma!

01:33:31.941 --> 01:33:33.024
Get down, motherfucker!

01:33:37.571 --> 01:33:38.780
Come on!

01:33:41.492 --> 01:33:42.743
Fuck!

01:33:52.128 --> 01:33:53.461
Go! Go!

01:33:53.629 --> 01:33:54.796
Get down, baby!

01:33:54.964 --> 01:33:56.715
Dale, no!

01:33:56.882 --> 01:33:58.508
No, wake up, man.

01:33:58.676 --> 01:34:00.552
No, you're not dying, man.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:03.306
Not without me.

01:34:03.473 --> 01:34:04.807
- Dale.
- What?

01:34:04.975 --> 01:34:06.809
You're alive.

01:34:06.977 --> 01:34:10.479
- You're... You're alive.
- What happened?

01:34:11.064 --> 01:34:13.149
- He got your ear, man.
- He got my what?

01:34:13.317 --> 01:34:16.027
- He got your ear.
- Fuck!

01:34:17.154 --> 01:34:18.820
Fuck!

01:34:21.072 --> 01:34:22.574
- Help!
- My ear.

01:34:22.742 --> 01:34:23.783
- Yeah.
- Help!

01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:26.036
- You killed my ear.
- You shot me.

01:34:26.203 --> 01:34:28.121
- I didn't do that.
- He shot me.

01:34:28.289 --> 01:34:29.331
You shot him?

01:34:29.498 --> 01:34:31.708
- Get your hands off of me.
- Shut up.

01:34:31.876 --> 01:34:33.501
We've had enough out of you.

01:34:33.669 --> 01:34:34.919
I'm not your friend.

01:34:35.087 --> 01:34:36.463
Maybe I can just...

01:34:36.630 --> 01:34:38.631
No. No, infected.

01:34:38.799 --> 01:34:41.176
Is that it? Maybe if we just hold it.

01:35:15.711 --> 01:35:17.379
It's clear.

01:35:18.297 --> 01:35:20.633
Dude. Look.

01:35:20.801 --> 01:35:22.385
Nice.

01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:36.231
Bullets.

01:35:44.408 --> 01:35:47.243
So seriously,
how gross does my ear look?

01:35:47.411 --> 01:35:50.746
Is it really disgusting
or is it, like, kind of cool in a way?

01:35:50.914 --> 01:35:52.957
Right now it's pretty disgusting.

01:35:53.125 --> 01:35:55.083
I feel like I can smell it.

01:35:55.251 --> 01:35:57.752
Don't worry, bro.
Think about Evander Holyfield.

01:35:57.920 --> 01:35:58.962
You can't even tell.

01:35:59.130 --> 01:36:00.256
That's a good point.

01:36:00.424 --> 01:36:01.798
Wait.

01:36:44.508 --> 01:36:45.884
Did you shoot that guy?

01:36:46.051 --> 01:36:47.635
No. I'm out of bullets.

01:36:47.803 --> 01:36:49.345
Me too.

01:36:49.513 --> 01:36:51.806
Maybe it was ricochet.

01:36:51.974 --> 01:36:53.975
Gravity.

01:36:54.143 --> 01:36:55.852
Oh, nice.

01:36:56.020 --> 01:36:57.980
You go down.

01:36:58.148 --> 01:36:59.315
I'll cover.

01:36:59.483 --> 01:37:02.651
Watch my back.
I'll go down and take care of this.

01:37:07.157 --> 01:37:08.990
Sexy motherfucker.

01:37:27.636 --> 01:37:30.012
No, no, there might be
more bad guys up there.

01:37:30.179 --> 01:37:32.472
No, we'll sneak out through
the vent. Come on.

01:37:32.640 --> 01:37:35.850
I'll boost you up, okay?
And then you pull me up.

01:37:37.604 --> 01:37:39.396
Oh, nice.

01:37:40.899 --> 01:37:42.524
Here we go. Okay.

01:37:42.691 --> 01:37:45.610
Get up. Yeah. Nice.

01:37:48.531 --> 01:37:49.531
Nice.

01:37:50.199 --> 01:37:52.033
Nice. Okay.

01:37:52.201 --> 01:37:53.451
Pull me up.

01:37:53.619 --> 01:37:55.411
I'm ready. Go.

01:37:55.579 --> 01:37:57.373
- Give it to me.
- Come on.

01:37:57.541 --> 01:38:00.000
- Be taller.
- Be stronger.

01:38:00.168 --> 01:38:02.169
- Pull harder.
- Dale, come on.

01:38:02.337 --> 01:38:05.047
Pull. Pull me. Come on, man.

01:38:05.215 --> 01:38:08.050
- I'm jumping as high as I can.
- Denton!

01:38:10.971 --> 01:38:12.012
Dale!

01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:13.722
I'll get help. I'll get help.

01:38:15.517 --> 01:38:18.726
Go ahead and run, you little dipshit.
I'll find you.

01:39:46.399 --> 01:39:48.233
Give me that fire extinguisher.

01:39:48.401 --> 01:39:49.610
Okay.

01:40:10.923 --> 01:40:14.259
You and me, baby.
Drop it now! Put the bag down!

01:40:14.427 --> 01:40:15.594
Now!

01:40:30.526 --> 01:40:31.651
Fuck you!

01:40:36.783 --> 01:40:39.702
Fuck the police!

01:41:00.223 --> 01:41:02.558
Motherfucking kill you!

01:41:04.977 --> 01:41:07.520
- Why you doing this to me?
- Why you doing this to me?

01:41:08.605 --> 01:41:10.106
Oh, shit!

01:41:10.274 --> 01:41:11.483
Come here!

01:41:18.825 --> 01:41:20.743
I hate you!

01:41:20.910 --> 01:41:23.203
No! Ted, stop it!

01:41:30.127 --> 01:41:33.046
Come on, bitch.
Come on, I'll twist your balls so tight.

01:41:33.214 --> 01:41:35.174
You're in the jungle now, baby.

01:41:43.140 --> 01:41:44.223
Jesus!

01:41:51.608 --> 01:41:53.150
Fuck.

01:42:02.410 --> 01:42:03.952
Gonna die.

01:42:06.623 --> 01:42:08.957
- You killed...
- I didn't wanna do that.

01:42:10.044 --> 01:42:11.960
But you weren't gonna stop.

01:42:18.509 --> 01:42:20.092
Shoot him!

01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:22.595
Just take it easy, buddy.

01:42:24.348 --> 01:42:26.724
Shoot him, you dumb fuck!

01:42:29.854 --> 01:42:31.647
I'm hungry.

01:42:31.815 --> 01:42:33.732
I'm going home.

01:42:37.654 --> 01:42:39.321
All right.

01:42:40.907 --> 01:42:42.574
Help.

01:42:45.327 --> 01:42:47.078
I knew you were going soft.

01:42:47.246 --> 01:42:50.332
Dinner's gonna be cold tonight,
asshole.

01:42:50.500 --> 01:42:52.584
Fucked up, man.

01:42:54.796 --> 01:42:58.340
- Well, lookie here. Mr. Folgers.
- Oh, man.

01:42:58.508 --> 01:42:59.967
What's up, sir?

01:43:00.593 --> 01:43:04.388
- Look, I didn't Wanna hit you, man...
- Shut the fuck up.

01:43:04.556 --> 01:43:09.059
You think you was gonna
get me, motherfucker, huh?

01:43:09.227 --> 01:43:11.854
You need to sit
your little sexy ass down...

01:43:12.021 --> 01:43:14.147
...and watch yourself get killed now.

01:43:14.315 --> 01:43:15.732
All right.

01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.984
You know what?
This is how it's gonna be?

01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:21.737
All right. This is howit ends.

01:43:37.881 --> 01:43:42.009
You just got killed by a
Daewoo Lanos, motherfucker.

01:43:42.176 --> 01:43:43.677
How you like me now, huh?

01:43:45.013 --> 01:43:46.179
Gross.

01:43:46.347 --> 01:43:47.390
Red?

01:43:47.851 --> 01:43:49.018
Saul.

01:43:49.186 --> 01:43:52.062
Hey, Saul. I came back for you, bro.

01:43:52.230 --> 01:43:53.896
- Yeah.
- I remembered, man.

01:43:54.731 --> 01:43:56.232
Bro's before ho's.

01:43:56.942 --> 01:43:59.902
- You lied to me.
- I did. I lied bigtime to you.

01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:04.531
Dale said that you didn't even
have herpes and I said that you did.

01:44:04.699 --> 01:44:08.286
Honestly, like, from now on, from
everything that we've gone through...

01:44:08.454 --> 01:44:12.249
...and, like, from seeing this asshole's
nuts smashed with my Daewoo...

01:44:12.416 --> 01:44:15.418
...I Wanna be a better friend to you,
like I really am.

01:44:16.212 --> 01:44:19.089
I fucking love you, dog.
Fucking love you.

01:44:19.715 --> 01:44:21.800
I wanna be inside you, homes.

01:44:23.052 --> 01:44:24.802
No more lies, Red.

01:44:24.970 --> 01:44:27.514
- This is my moment.
- This is your moment.

01:44:30.101 --> 01:44:31.601
Red!

01:44:49.287 --> 01:44:52.205
You know what? I'm feeling it.

01:44:52.373 --> 01:44:54.249
Red, I'm coming, baby.

01:44:54.417 --> 01:44:56.835
Your stupidity amazes me.

01:44:59.254 --> 01:45:01.005
Hey, Ted!

01:45:01.172 --> 01:45:03.132
You killed my brother...

01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:06.428
...Caucasian son of cocksucker!

01:45:06.595 --> 01:45:09.639
Suck my balls! TWo times!

01:45:17.481 --> 01:45:18.565
Bitch!

01:45:18.733 --> 01:45:20.275
Bring it on.

01:45:31.870 --> 01:45:32.911
Shit. Dale.

01:45:34.456 --> 01:45:36.665
Dale!

01:45:36.833 --> 01:45:38.500
Holy shit!

01:46:14.997 --> 01:46:16.039
Sorry, Ted.

01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:22.169
Yo? 've been served.

01:46:29.303 --> 01:46:34.766
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

01:46:39.062 --> 01:46:40.687
Sa? I! Sa? I!

01:46:46.237 --> 01:46:49.197
Wake up, man! This place
is gonna collapse! Come on!

01:46:49.365 --> 01:46:51.199
Come to me!

01:46:53.244 --> 01:46:55.078
Yo? 're not dying today, friend.

01:46:55.246 --> 01:46:58.123
Not on my watch.

01:47:25.109 --> 01:47:28.319
Saul. Wake up, man, please.

01:47:28.487 --> 01:47:29.946
Saul.

01:47:30.114 --> 01:47:31.614
Wake up.

01:47:31.782 --> 01:47:34.200
Oh, sweet Saul.

01:47:36.704 --> 01:47:39.414
Saul.

01:47:42.252 --> 01:47:44.044
Yes. Yeah.

01:47:44.212 --> 01:47:45.671
Saul, you made it.

01:47:45.839 --> 01:47:48.381
- What?
- Yeah.

01:47:48.549 --> 01:47:50.467
Where am I?

01:47:50.634 --> 01:47:52.677
You made it, man.

01:47:52.845 --> 01:47:55.387
- You saved me.
- You came back for me.

01:47:55.555 --> 01:47:58.599
- Yeah.
- Oh, thank you.

01:47:58.766 --> 01:48:01.478
What happened?

01:48:07.985 --> 01:48:10.403
Holy shit.

01:48:14.325 --> 01:48:16.034
What's that?

01:48:18.829 --> 01:48:20.663
Hi.

01:48:20.831 --> 01:48:22.707
- Red?
- Red?

01:48:25.544 --> 01:48:28.338
- Red.
- Hey.

01:48:28.506 --> 01:48:31.841
Red. Where'd you come from, man?
Where'd he come from?

01:48:32.009 --> 01:48:33.092
He came back to save us.

01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.344
- He saved us?
- Yeah.

01:48:34.512 --> 01:48:35.929
All right, man.

01:48:36.096 --> 01:48:38.223
- We all saved each other.
- Yeah.

01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:41.267
Oh, man. We made it, guys.

01:48:41.435 --> 01:48:45.063
We made it. Oh, we made it.

01:48:50.528 --> 01:48:55.489
Hello, you're listening to PPRPBP.
I am Dale Denton.

01:48:55.657 --> 01:48:59.494
The topic of the day: New beginnings.
Getting over losses.

01:48:59.662 --> 01:49:02.038
Friends. Life.

01:49:02.206 --> 01:49:04.832
We have our first caller.

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:07.627
Yes, ring-ring-ring. How's it going?

01:49:07.795 --> 01:49:09.420
Hi. Am I on the air?

01:49:09.588 --> 01:49:12.632
You are. You're about
to get D'd by the Dale.

01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.883
A D in the face.

01:49:14.051 --> 01:49:15.385
- Dale Denton?
- Yeah?

01:49:15.553 --> 01:49:20.224
You're my hero.

01:49:20.892 --> 01:49:22.393
You are good, man. Seriously.

01:49:22.561 --> 01:49:24.478
- Thanks.
- Gotta admit, you're pretty good.

01:49:24.646 --> 01:49:26.647
- It sounds pretty good.
- It sounds real.

01:49:26.814 --> 01:49:29.606
- It's not bad, huh?
- If I close my eyes, it sounds like...

01:49:29.774 --> 01:49:32.901
- You are on the radio.
- That's the radio. That's a DJ.

01:49:33.069 --> 01:49:35.904
- If you were on it, I would listen to it.
- Thanks, man.

01:49:36.072 --> 01:49:38.449
It's like when my bubbe
was always playing opera...

01:49:38.617 --> 01:49:40.451
...I hated it, but my bubbe loves it.

01:49:40.619 --> 01:49:43.413
Then it grows on you.
It grows on you. Yeah.

01:49:43.581 --> 01:49:46.207
It's like Red. I didn't like Red
when I first met him.

01:49:46.375 --> 01:49:48.459
- You didn't like me?
- You liked him so much...

01:49:48.627 --> 01:49:50.420
...I like you now.

01:49:50.588 --> 01:49:54.048
I know this sounds weird, but can
we be best friends? Just us, for real?

01:49:54.216 --> 01:49:56.259
- We should all be best friends.
- We should.

01:49:56.427 --> 01:49:59.638
Seriously. You guys are, like,
both of my best friends.

01:49:59.806 --> 01:50:02.599
You didn't know it. Now you know it,
we'll all be best friends.

01:50:02.766 --> 01:50:04.976
Know those hearts that break up,
"best friends"?

01:50:05.144 --> 01:50:06.561
We should get a three-way one.

01:50:06.729 --> 01:50:10.356
- I don't know if they make those.
- We should make the first one.

01:50:10.524 --> 01:50:13.443
I want the middle piece,
so it'll be crooked on both sides.

01:50:13.611 --> 01:50:17.530
I know We've gone over this, but, like,
1000 pardons, 1000 pardons, please.

01:50:17.698 --> 01:50:20.450
- I fucked up...
- I was a dick to you, man. I'm sorry.

01:50:20.618 --> 01:50:23.119
I know I was an asshole.
I hope I redeemed myself.

01:50:23.287 --> 01:50:26.164
- I know me and you had our deal.
- We've had some times.

01:50:26.332 --> 01:50:29.208
I feel like something's happening here.
Is that a boner?

01:50:29.376 --> 01:50:32.128
Is that a condo? That us moving
into an apartment together?

01:50:32.296 --> 01:50:33.837
Is that us getting a time-share?

01:50:34.005 --> 01:50:36.423
- You threw an ashtray at his face.
- You hit me, man.

01:50:36.591 --> 01:50:38.968
At the time, I was like:
But it was kind of funny.

01:50:39.136 --> 01:50:41.679
You hit me with a DustBuster, man.

01:50:41.847 --> 01:50:44.974
I didn't Wanna hurt you.
It was like, "You better not leave here."

01:50:45.142 --> 01:50:47.143
- That was such a good fight, man.
- That was.

01:50:47.311 --> 01:50:48.770
You fuckhead.

01:50:48.937 --> 01:50:51.481
- The car chase was awesome.
- You got into a car chase?

01:50:51.649 --> 01:50:54.275
- Are you kidding me? Oh, my God.
- Yeah, it was...

01:50:54.443 --> 01:50:57.363
I, like, had my foot
through the window.

01:50:57.530 --> 01:51:01.575
My groin... I mean,
I felt like a wishbone.

01:51:03.328 --> 01:51:06.537
- I just feel different about everything.
- Me too, man. Everything.

01:51:06.705 --> 01:51:08.789
Like, I never Wanna
kill anybody else again.

01:51:08.956 --> 01:51:10.832
- Ever.
- That's something you pretty much...

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.834
You can just kind of
dip your toes into.

01:51:13.002 --> 01:51:14.878
We kind of dipped our toes
into murder.

01:51:15.046 --> 01:51:17.507
I killed six guys, I think.
How many guys did you...?

01:51:17.675 --> 01:51:19.550
- We each shot several people.
- A lot.

01:51:19.718 --> 01:51:21.719
Some people get a taste for it,
but I don't.

01:51:21.887 --> 01:51:25.014
I shot someone who was already dead
so that doesn't count as a murder.

01:51:25.182 --> 01:51:27.350
Apparently you hit him
with your car, I'm told.

01:51:27.518 --> 01:51:30.061
- That... You killed him.
- Okay, so I did murder somebody.

01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:32.563
- You murdered, man.
- Not a big deal. That's cool.

01:51:32.731 --> 01:51:35.316
- That's cool. Whatever. Kill or be killed.
- I know.

01:51:35.485 --> 01:51:37.277
I'm trying to decide
how stoned I am...

01:51:37.445 --> 01:51:39.655
...and just how on the verge
of death am I now.

01:51:39.823 --> 01:51:43.282
Am I seeing shit because I'm stoned
or because I have no blood leff?

01:51:43.450 --> 01:51:46.285
- You've been shot, like, seven times.
- You gotta eat.

01:51:46.453 --> 01:51:48.204
- You're losing stuft.
- Yeah.

01:51:48.372 --> 01:51:50.248
- Here.
- Yeah, okay.

01:51:50.416 --> 01:51:53.875
- Here comes the airplane.
- Look, like a baby.

01:51:56.088 --> 01:51:58.548
It's a miracle.
I think We should all take a moment...

01:51:58.716 --> 01:52:01.300
...and think about what a miracle
it is that we got out.

01:52:01.468 --> 01:52:03.469
And that we became friends
in the process...

01:52:03.637 --> 01:52:05.888
...and learned some shit about life
and stuff.

01:52:06.056 --> 01:52:10.268
Should we touch each other's hands
while We do it? Okay.

01:52:12.312 --> 01:52:13.729
I love you guys.

01:52:13.897 --> 01:52:16.273
I love you dudes so much.

01:52:19.194 --> 01:52:21.862
I'll remember that
for the rest of my life.

01:52:22.739 --> 01:52:24.198
- Red?
- Red?

01:52:24.366 --> 01:52:26.367
Yo, Red, man. You alive?

01:52:26.535 --> 01:52:27.868
What's up, pal?

01:52:28.787 --> 01:52:30.287
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:52:30.455 --> 01:52:34.167
I'm like the nerd at the sleepover
who fell asleep at 9.

01:52:34.335 --> 01:52:36.586
That's okay. We Won't put
our dicks in your mouth.

01:52:36.754 --> 01:52:40.215
- Oh, God.
- Hey, there's bubbe.

01:52:40.383 --> 01:52:42.508
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:52:42.676 --> 01:52:44.593
Yeah, maybe
we should go to the doctor.

01:52:44.761 --> 01:52:46.887
Do you think she'll drive me
to the hospital?

01:52:47.055 --> 01:52:48.972
Me too. I should
get the ear looked at.

01:52:49.139 --> 01:52:51.391
My ear should probably
get professional attention.

01:52:51.559 --> 01:52:53.644
- It is bad.
- That's a bullet burp.

01:52:53.812 --> 01:52:56.856
Either I'm getting ready to die
or I'm gonna take a massive shit.

01:52:57.023 --> 01:52:58.899
If somebody could get me
to the hospital.

01:52:59.067 --> 01:53:00.651
Blood from my ear just...

01:53:00.819 --> 01:53:03.612
You guys smell like shit.

01:53:04.823 --> 01:53:07.491
You are in serious danger.
