WEBVTT

00:00:30.906 --> 00:00:32.115
Greg?

00:00:32.491 --> 00:00:34.826
Mmm.

00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:37.453
Greg?

00:00:37.538 --> 00:00:38.621
What?

00:00:38.831 --> 00:00:40.123
Greg !
Huh?

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:41.541
What?

00:00:41.625 --> 00:00:42.667
What are you doing?
Get up!

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:44.043
Mom and Dad
have been
calling you for an hour.

00:00:44.128 --> 00:00:46.003
You're about to be late
for your first day
of middle school.

00:00:46.088 --> 00:00:47.422
What?

00:00:48.298 --> 00:00:50.049
Oh, geez!
How did that happen?

00:00:50.134 --> 00:00:51.676
Go, go, go!
Mom's about to flip out!

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.262
She sent me to get you
while she waits in the car!

00:01:34.762 --> 00:01:37.597
What are you doing?
What's going on?

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:39.849
Getting ready for. . .

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.898
. . .school.

00:01:46.982 --> 00:01:49.901
Are you insane?
School doesn't start
till next week.

00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:53.946
And, FYl,
school doesn't start
at 4:00 in the morning !

00:01:54.031 --> 00:01:57.450
You woke up Manny.
And if he doesn't
go back down. . .

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:58.618
Good morning !

00:01:58.702 --> 00:02:01.454
There is no way
he is going back down.

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:03.122
l just wanted to
sleep till 6:00.

00:02:03.207 --> 00:02:04.165
Bubby!

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:05.374
Go to bed.
l got him.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:07.960
Greg, what are you doing up
making all this noise?

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:10.505
lt was Rodrick!
He woke me up!

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:12.632
He changed my clock!

00:02:14.843 --> 00:02:16.594
But l swear,
he was just. . .

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:18.012
Go to bed.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.309
What is that smell?
l can't
even identify it.

00:02:39.034 --> 00:02:40.409
Bubby!

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:52.088
Happy Birthday!

00:02:52.172 --> 00:02:53.589
Here, Bubby.

00:02:53.757 --> 00:02:55.842
Wow! Look at the size
of that flamethrower!

00:03:05.435 --> 00:03:08.604
Okay, first of all,
let me get
something straight.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.190
This is a journal,
not a diary.

00:03:12.484 --> 00:03:14.527
Yeah, l know
what it says
on the cover.

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.988
But when my mom went out
to buy this thing,

00:03:17.072 --> 00:03:20.533
l specifically told her
not to buy one
that said "diary" on it.

00:03:20.617 --> 00:03:24.787
This just proves
Mom doesn't understand
anything about kids my age.

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:27.290
Huh?
Sissy!

00:03:29.001 --> 00:03:31.502
The only reason l agreed
to write in this thing
is because

00:03:31.587 --> 00:03:33.963
when l'm rich and famous
l'll have
better things to do

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:36.549
than answer
people's stupid questions
all day long.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.509
Gregory, tell us
about your childhood !

00:03:38.594 --> 00:03:40.887
Were you always so smart
and handsome?

00:03:40.971 --> 00:03:43.264
Here's my journal.
Now, shoo, shoo.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.311
That's our boy up there.

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.521
Why did l ever say
no to him?

00:03:50.606 --> 00:03:51.606
Mom got me this thing

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.442
so l could write down
my feelings about
starting middle school.

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:56.527
But l'm gonna be fine.

00:03:56.612 --> 00:03:59.447
lt's my best friend,
Rowley Jefferson,
l'm worried about.

00:03:59.531 --> 00:04:01.741
He's definitely not
middle school ready.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:03.784
Geronimo!

00:04:07.623 --> 00:04:10.791
He's not quite clear
on the concept
of growing up.

00:04:10.876 --> 00:04:14.754
l want a puppy, a kitty,
a gumball machine. . .

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:17.757
But anyway, this is
about me, not Rowley.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:20.593
l always figured
they'd make a movie
about my life.

00:04:20.677 --> 00:04:23.763
But l didn't think
they'd start
the story here.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:27.016
Because, seriously,
who wants to see a movie
about a kid

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.977
who's stuck in middle school
with a bunch of morons?

00:04:54.211 --> 00:04:57.171
Three days, no shower.
Smell the love!

00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.215
Let me go, Rodrick!

00:05:00.926 --> 00:05:03.803
Come on.
We're just having
some fun, right?

00:05:03.887 --> 00:05:05.680
No, okay. So, look.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:09.350
Mom asked me
to give you some advice
about middle school.

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:12.269
lt's real simple.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:15.606
Don't talk to anyone.
Don't look at anyone.
Don't go anywhere.

00:05:15.691 --> 00:05:19.986
Don't sit down.
Don't raise your hand.
Don't go to the bathroom.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.156
Don't get noticed.
Don't choose
the wrong locker. Don't. . .

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.784
Who am l kidding?

00:05:26.868 --> 00:05:29.745
You'll be dead
or homeschooled by
the end of the year, anyway.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.164
And don't be seen
with Rowley.

00:05:44.136 --> 00:05:45.845
Manny, stop it! Mom !

00:05:45.929 --> 00:05:47.013
Thanks for
the eggs, Mom.

00:05:47.097 --> 00:05:48.514
Frank?
Greg?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.224
l think it's gross
and undignified

00:05:50.308 --> 00:05:53.144
that l have to eat breakfast
next to him on the potty.

00:05:53.228 --> 00:05:55.604
Okay, well, it's your fault
he's still potty training.

00:05:56.148 --> 00:05:57.481
Don't look down, Manny.

00:05:57.566 --> 00:06:01.068
The potty monster
doesn't like it
when you look at him.

00:06:02.654 --> 00:06:04.196
l was just joking with him.

00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.575
Okay. Kiss him you're sorry
and then let's get a move on.

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:10.327
Can't be late for
your first day of school.

00:06:26.094 --> 00:06:29.180
Let me just say
for the record that I think
middle school may be

00:06:29.264 --> 00:06:31.307
the dumbest idea
ever invented.

00:06:31.391 --> 00:06:33.768
You got kids like me
who haven't hit
their growth spurt yet

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:36.937
mixed in with gorillas
who have to shave twice a day.

00:06:37.814 --> 00:06:41.984
There's juvenile delinquents
and weirdos.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.487
I'm smaIIer than about
95% of the kids
at my school...

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:45.863
Give it back! Stop!

00:06:45.947 --> 00:06:49.033
...so thank God
for Chirag Gupta.

00:06:49.117 --> 00:06:50.117
lt's mine! Stop!

00:06:50.202 --> 00:06:51.243
Can l have
the backpack?

00:06:51.328 --> 00:06:52.578
You got to jump higher.
lt's not yours!

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.955
He's an exceIIent buffer
between me and these morons.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.665
Hey, Greg.

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.543
Hey, fella!

00:06:59.836 --> 00:07:03.339
SeriousIy, I don't know
what happened to these kids
over the summer.

00:07:05.217 --> 00:07:07.009
Was there a nucIear accident?

00:07:08.178 --> 00:07:10.679
Science experiment
gone bad?

00:07:10.764 --> 00:07:15.184
Thank God there are a few
normal people or this place
wouId be a totaI freak show.

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:20.981
lf you're as discriminating
as I am,

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:25.194
it can be tough to figure out
where to sit on your first day
of middIe schooI.

00:07:25.278 --> 00:07:26.529
One bad move

00:07:26.613 --> 00:07:30.116
and you're stuck
next to some idiot
for the rest of the year.

00:07:37.374 --> 00:07:38.541
Greg !

00:07:39.459 --> 00:07:42.628
Remember how I said
Rowley wasn't
middle school ready?

00:07:44.214 --> 00:07:45.965
Well, there you go.

00:07:51.221 --> 00:07:52.638
What are you wearing?

00:07:52.722 --> 00:07:56.976
My family just got back
from Guatemala!
lt's my serape!

00:07:59.104 --> 00:08:00.479
Nice, huh?

00:08:00.564 --> 00:08:04.942
All right, class,
l'm Mrs. Flint.
Everybody take your seats!

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:11.323
Welcome to your first day
of middle school.

00:08:11.408 --> 00:08:14.076
Remember your seats.
You'll be sitting here
every day.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.913
Rowley, if you
had to say where
you were ranked

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:20.749
in terms of
popularity
from one to 200,

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.418
where would you
put yourself?

00:08:23.295 --> 00:08:25.421
ls 200 good or bad?

00:08:26.965 --> 00:08:29.300
l'd say you're somewhere
around the 1 54 mark.

00:08:30.427 --> 00:08:33.095
l'd put myself
around number 1 9 or 20.

00:08:34.723 --> 00:08:37.183
l might even have a shot
at the top spot
by the end of the year,

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.268
if things go the way
l think they will.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.395
Well, who's at the bottom?

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:44.899
Hey, guys, wanna see
my secret freckle?

00:08:46.109 --> 00:08:49.904
Fregley.
Sent home for hygiene issues
at Ieast once a month.

00:08:54.743 --> 00:08:57.703
Check it out.
lt's got a hair in it!

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.456
What color is that?

00:09:03.627 --> 00:09:05.377
You wanna help me name it?

00:09:05.462 --> 00:09:08.088
All right, ladies!
Gather around !

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.925
Come on,
put the knitting down !
Let's go!

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:15.721
All right, everybody.

00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:18.724
l'm Coach Malone
and l am your gym teacher.

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.559
P. E. is as much
a part of my life

00:09:20.644 --> 00:09:23.729
as waking up in the morning
and going to the bathroom.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:27.399
l live and breathe
Physical Education.

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:29.568
Now, who's with me?

00:09:29.653 --> 00:09:30.945
Are you ready to have
some fun out there?

00:09:31.029 --> 00:09:32.071
Yeah !

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:33.906
All right, outstanding !

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:35.407
So we're gonna
divide you up
into two teams.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:38.494
So you two, over here.
You, you, you, this way.

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:40.871
Yeah, you three,
this side. Good.

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.874
You guys are going to
be Shirts!

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:47.795
And you will be Skins.

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:53.801
Why are we Skins?
l hate this.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:56.720
He's just trying to make
kids like us feel bad.

00:09:56.805 --> 00:09:58.347
What do you mean,
kids like us?

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.266
l just don't want
to get a sunburn,
right, Rowley?

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.435
My name is Bell E. Button.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.728
What's yours?

00:10:05.188 --> 00:10:10.526
Okay, let's start off
with a little game
l like to call Gladiator.

00:10:12.237 --> 00:10:13.696
- l got this one!
- No!

00:10:14.489 --> 00:10:15.990
Take that!

00:10:24.416 --> 00:10:25.958
Cover me!

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.381
Oh, God.

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:39.680
Not good !

00:10:39.764 --> 00:10:42.641
We're never going
to be able to
outrun these guys!

00:10:42.726 --> 00:10:43.809
We don't have to
outrun them !

00:10:43.893 --> 00:10:45.728
We just have to
outrun Chirag !

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.188
Take a Iook,
take a Iook,
take a Iook

00:10:48.273 --> 00:10:49.898
At the kids on the street

00:10:49.983 --> 00:10:51.483
No, they never miss a beat

00:10:51.568 --> 00:10:55.946
Never miss a beat

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.660
Think they saw us?
No way.

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.079
They were focused on
getting that kid
with the limp.

00:11:04.164 --> 00:11:05.998
We'll hide here
for the rest
of the class

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:08.250
because l'm not
playing that game.

00:11:08.335 --> 00:11:09.543
lt's not fair.

00:11:09.627 --> 00:11:11.962
He's got all
the Neanderthals
on the same team.

00:11:12.047 --> 00:11:13.047
lt's barbaric!

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:15.257
lt's completely
barbaric.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.887
This place is an
intellectual wasteland.

00:11:19.971 --> 00:11:21.638
But, you know,
it's nice to
meet someone

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:24.641
more interested
in his mind
than in his body.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:28.437
You girls get to jump rope.
What are you doing hiding?

00:11:28.521 --> 00:11:30.314
Avoiding the pain.

00:11:31.399 --> 00:11:33.692
lt all starts
in middle school,
you know?

00:11:33.777 --> 00:11:36.278
You're not a kid anymore.
The coddling has stopped.

00:11:36.363 --> 00:11:40.574
Kids are now separated
by intelligence.
The weak are picked on.

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:45.704
And girls you've known
since kindergarten won't
even talk to you anymore.

00:11:46.414 --> 00:11:49.333
Okay, well,
sounds like you got it
all figured out,

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.543
so go back
to your book.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.879
This place is
a glorified holding pen.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:57.633
All the way!
All the way!
You're like a machine!

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:58.884
lt's where
adults put you

00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:03.055
as you make that
awkward transition
between child and teenager

00:12:03.139 --> 00:12:05.641
so they don't even
have to look at you.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.644
Hi. l'm Angie.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:11.897
Great story.
We're gonna go now.

00:12:11.981 --> 00:12:14.566
Why? This is
a good spot.

00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:16.819
lt's a perfect spot.

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.154
l survived all of
the sixth grade here.

00:12:19.239 --> 00:12:21.657
And l would enjoy
some like-minded company

00:12:21.741 --> 00:12:23.784
to get me through
the seventh.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:27.079
ls that the whistle?
l think l hear the whistle.

00:12:27.163 --> 00:12:28.205
We need to go.

00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:30.707
No showboating,
all right?

00:12:30.792 --> 00:12:32.251
Why are we leaving?

00:12:32.335 --> 00:12:34.336
We could get killed
out here in the open !

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:37.339
Put your shirt on.
They'll think
we're on their team.

00:12:37.424 --> 00:12:41.468
Besides, getting crushed
is better than being seen
with that freak job.

00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.471
Trust me, you can't
recover from
social suicide.

00:12:44.848 --> 00:12:47.850
l never talked to a girl
that long before.

00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:50.436
Whoa!

00:12:51.479 --> 00:12:53.355
Check that out.

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:05.993
ls that cheese?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.834
Stop!

00:13:14.210 --> 00:13:18.130
Good God, man !
You almost got
the Cheese Touch.

00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:19.631
The what?

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:21.383
The Cheese Touch.

00:13:21.468 --> 00:13:23.635
Nobody knows
when or how,

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.390
but one day that cheese
mysteriously appeared
on the blacktop.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:31.685
Nobody knew
who it belonged to.

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:35.564
Nobody touched it.
Nobody threw it away.

00:13:35.648 --> 00:13:37.191
And so there it sat,

00:13:37.275 --> 00:13:40.694
growing more foul
and powerful by the day.

00:13:40.778 --> 00:13:43.697
Then one day,
a kid named Darren WaIsh

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:46.492
made the biggest mistake
of his Iife.

00:13:47.076 --> 00:13:49.161
Darren touched
the cheese!

00:13:49.245 --> 00:13:52.331
No, l didn't!
l just looked at it!
Really!

00:13:52.415 --> 00:13:55.167
Darren had
the Cheese Touch!

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:58.045
It was worse
than nucIear cooties.

00:13:59.088 --> 00:14:01.173
He became an outcast.

00:14:02.926 --> 00:14:05.719
The only way to get rid
of the Cheese Touch

00:14:05.803 --> 00:14:08.597
was by passing it on
to someone eIse.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:16.688
And so began
the Cheese Touch Frenzy.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:18.857
Friend turning on friend.

00:14:18.942 --> 00:14:20.609
Brother turning on sister.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:22.569
It was madness.

00:14:23.404 --> 00:14:28.617
Until a German
exchange student named
Dieter Muller took it away.

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.494
Dieter has
the Cheese Touch !

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:32.246
Ze Cheese Touch?

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.914
Vat is it?

00:14:33.998 --> 00:14:36.375
Vat does it mean,
ze Cheese Touch??

00:14:36.459 --> 00:14:40.420
Sadly for Dieter,
that fact
was lost in translation.

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.172
Nooooooooo......!

00:14:42.257 --> 00:14:45.300
Thankfully, he moved back
to DüsseIdorf and took
the Cheese Touch with him.

00:14:48.596 --> 00:14:53.559
And so the cheese sits,
patiently waiting
for its next victim.

00:14:53.977 --> 00:14:55.477
Wow.
Wow.

00:14:56.396 --> 00:14:59.022
This is
a terrible place.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:20.335
No doors?

00:15:20.420 --> 00:15:21.420
None.

00:15:21.504 --> 00:15:24.172
l'm not pooping
until l'm in
high school.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:29.386
The cafeteria,
possibly the cruelest place
on Earth.

00:15:29.887 --> 00:15:33.724
But I was about
to make some kid's day
by sitting next to him.

00:15:33.808 --> 00:15:35.142
That seat's saved.

00:15:35.727 --> 00:15:37.227
For who?

00:15:37.395 --> 00:15:38.812
lt's saved.

00:15:42.025 --> 00:15:43.358
That one's saved, too.

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:46.320
So not happening.

00:15:46.404 --> 00:15:47.571
Uh-uh-uh.

00:15:48.364 --> 00:15:49.531
Taken.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:53.577
Where are we
supposed to eat?

00:16:04.881 --> 00:16:07.716
l guess this is where
all the cool guys hang out.

00:16:13.514 --> 00:16:18.060
Fregley must have bumped
his head when he was IittIe,
like, really hard.

00:16:27.236 --> 00:16:29.529
Okay, okay,

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:32.491
so my first day
could have gone better,

00:16:32.575 --> 00:16:34.534
but at Ieast
I wasn't humiIiated.

00:16:34.619 --> 00:16:38.455
Hey, Greg !
You want to come over
and play?

00:16:44.587 --> 00:16:46.963
What did he just
say to you?

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:48.298
Oh.

00:16:48.383 --> 00:16:49.675
l think my ride's here.

00:16:49.759 --> 00:16:53.428
Hey, guys.
So this guy
says to that guy,

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:56.765
"You wanna
come over and play?"

00:16:56.849 --> 00:16:58.850
Yeah ! Do you guys
wanna play with us?

00:17:00.061 --> 00:17:02.062
See? This is the probIem.

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:05.065
Right now l have to take abuse
from these morons.

00:17:05.149 --> 00:17:08.527
But in 20 years,
Quentin here
will be working for me.

00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:11.738
Greg, please don't fire me.

00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:15.617
l really need
my measly, pathetic job
scooping your dog's poop.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:17.494
Whatever.
l'll think about it.

00:17:18.746 --> 00:17:22.332
No, no, no.
Vanilla on the bottom
and chocolate on the top!

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.126
l can't eat this!

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.628
"Play," Rowley? "Play"?

00:17:26.713 --> 00:17:28.046
l've told you, like,
a billion times

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:31.091
that guys our age say
"hang out," not "play."

00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:32.384
Oops.

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:35.554
Seriously, if you're not
gonna listen to me,
just tell me,

00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:37.931
'cause if you
pull another stunt
like that,

00:17:38.015 --> 00:17:39.725
we'll be stuck on
the cafeteria floor

00:17:39.809 --> 00:17:41.893
for the rest of
middle school.

00:17:41.978 --> 00:17:44.271
l found half
a Snickers bar
down there.

00:17:44.814 --> 00:17:47.941
l can't be the guy
who eats off his lap
in the cafeteria.

00:17:48.025 --> 00:17:50.527
l should be at the top
of the food chain by now.

00:17:50.611 --> 00:17:53.280
Something's got to
change, fast.

00:17:53.364 --> 00:17:56.324
My mom told me
to just be myself and
people would like me.

00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:04.249
That would be good advice
if you were somebody else.

00:18:20.516 --> 00:18:22.309
Hey, little brother.

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:24.978
Was your first day as crappy
as l said it would be?

00:18:25.062 --> 00:18:28.356
No. Not at all.
You were wrong.

00:18:28.441 --> 00:18:29.649
lt was actually
better than l. . .

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:30.942
Worse.

00:18:32.653 --> 00:18:34.488
You didn't listen to me,
did you?

00:18:34.572 --> 00:18:38.492
l told you not to talk,
look or go anywhere,
and what happened?

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:40.994
He had to eat his lunch
on the floor.

00:18:41.078 --> 00:18:42.120
Rowley.

00:18:42.205 --> 00:18:43.580
Perfect.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:45.207
And if nobody wants you
sitting at their table,

00:18:45.291 --> 00:18:47.793
you think they want
Chummy Buttons over here?

00:18:47.877 --> 00:18:51.671
l was right. You're not even
gonna make it
out of there alive.

00:18:51.756 --> 00:18:53.673
The only chance you have
of making the yearbook is

00:18:53.758 --> 00:18:56.134
when they dedicate it
to your memory.

00:19:00.598 --> 00:19:03.934
So you wanna play
Twisted Wizard?

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:07.729
No. l have
a better idea.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:13.109
lf he catches you in here,
he will kill you.

00:19:13.194 --> 00:19:14.861
Literally, kill you.

00:19:14.946 --> 00:19:17.781
Don't worry.
As long as we hear the music,
we're okay.

00:19:19.075 --> 00:19:21.660
Whoa. Yeah. Wow.

00:19:21.744 --> 00:19:24.663
l didn't know Rodrick
was into motorcycles.

00:19:24.747 --> 00:19:25.956
l found it.

00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:27.290
Found what?

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:29.709
Rodrick's middle school
yearbook.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:33.672
This thing holds
all the answers.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:35.924
Rowley, this thing
is like a bible.

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:39.511
See this? This is where
a person like me
needs to be.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:44.850
The class favorites.

00:19:46.269 --> 00:19:48.562
They're the best
in their class.

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:52.190
These people
aren't nobodies.
They're famous.

00:19:52.275 --> 00:19:55.694
They don't have to worry
about getting a seat
in the cafeteria, either.

00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:58.864
Check this out.
There's tons of things
l qualify for.

00:19:58.948 --> 00:20:02.450
"Most Likely To Succeed,"
"Best Looking,"
"Class Clown."

00:20:02.785 --> 00:20:04.870
They should just
give that to me right now.

00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:06.913
Don't you have to be
funny for that?

00:20:07.874 --> 00:20:10.500
Hey! We could try
for cutest friends!

00:20:10.585 --> 00:20:13.920
What did l tell you
would happen if you ever
went in my room again?

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:16.339
But your band
is still playing.

00:20:16.424 --> 00:20:18.425
lt's the bass solo,
Turd Burglar!

00:20:18.509 --> 00:20:20.218
Don't you know anything
about music?

00:20:20.303 --> 00:20:23.555
Now, l came up here
to get a new drumstick,

00:20:23.639 --> 00:20:27.100
and now, Greg,
since Mom and Dad
are gone,

00:20:27.184 --> 00:20:30.979
l'm going to kill you.
Literally, kill you !

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:32.564
l told you.

00:20:32.648 --> 00:20:33.732
Beat it.

00:20:33.816 --> 00:20:37.903
Okay, but l just want
to say one thing !

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.738
Run, Greg, run !
What?

00:20:41.824 --> 00:20:43.158
Let go, Baby Hippo!

00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.666
You're gonna have to
come out sometime, loser!

00:20:51.751 --> 00:20:54.252
l'll wait here
as long as it takes.

00:20:54.337 --> 00:20:56.504
And then, you're dead.

00:21:10.186 --> 00:21:11.978
Time out, Rodrick.
l have to pee.

00:21:12.063 --> 00:21:15.190
No time outs.
Only death !

00:21:15.733 --> 00:21:17.150
But l really
have to go.

00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:18.610
Don't care.

00:22:07.076 --> 00:22:08.743
Move over!
l'm dying.

00:22:15.918 --> 00:22:16.918
Got you !

00:22:19.547 --> 00:22:22.007
Greg, did you throw
Manny off his. . .

00:22:22.091 --> 00:22:23.758
What is going on?

00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:26.594
Greg started it.
l just came in here
to take a shower.

00:22:26.679 --> 00:22:29.264
He's lying !
He was gonna kill me
'cause l was in his room !

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:31.641
And so you peed on him?

00:22:31.726 --> 00:22:34.811
Yes. l mean, no.
l mean. . .

00:22:35.187 --> 00:22:36.271
Yes.

00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:00.086
Wow, there's a lot
to sign up for.

00:23:00.171 --> 00:23:02.964
You could be class favorite
in a bunch of things.

00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:04.466
Jazz dancing !

00:23:04.550 --> 00:23:06.051
We could do
that one together!

00:23:06.135 --> 00:23:10.013
l can't believe
all these activities.
They're all so much work.

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:14.267
Staying after school,
meeting before school,
on weekends.

00:23:14.351 --> 00:23:16.686
What kind of
extracurricular activities
are these?

00:23:16.771 --> 00:23:18.813
Out of my way.

00:23:19.648 --> 00:23:21.983
Who let you into this school,
Greg Heffley?

00:23:22.276 --> 00:23:24.736
l was thinking
the same thing about you,
Patty Farrell.

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:26.905
You listen to me,
Greg Heffley.

00:23:26.989 --> 00:23:29.657
l'm running for
student council president
and l'm warning you,

00:23:29.742 --> 00:23:32.077
if you get in my way,
l will beat you up,

00:23:32.161 --> 00:23:34.996
just like l did
in kindergarten
and fourth grade.

00:23:37.917 --> 00:23:41.127
Fourth grade?
That one was ugly.

00:23:42.129 --> 00:23:45.340
What's her problem?
What did l ever do to her?

00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:50.887
Patty, Patty is a fatty,
has a face just like a ratty!

00:23:55.017 --> 00:23:57.519
Come on,
that was pretty funny.

00:23:57.603 --> 00:23:59.687
She needs to get
a sense of humor.

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:03.066
And l need something
to make me a class favorite.

00:24:03.150 --> 00:24:05.193
What about
class favorites?

00:24:06.612 --> 00:24:09.864
Don't you ever say
hi or hello
before you start talking?

00:24:09.949 --> 00:24:11.533
Hi.
Hello.

00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:14.369
Oh, Greg's only here
because he really wants
to be something. . .

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:15.703
Rowley!

00:24:16.372 --> 00:24:19.666
l was just saying that
l would really like to
nail these people

00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:21.668
because it's
so obvious that

00:24:21.752 --> 00:24:24.337
they're only doing
these activities
to get in the yearbook.

00:24:24.421 --> 00:24:26.714
You know, l like
your point of view.

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.967
You should sign up
for the school paper.

00:24:29.051 --> 00:24:30.552
We're the voice
of the people.

00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.096
Well, the people
are mostly idiots,

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:34.639
so l guess,
technically speaking,

00:24:34.723 --> 00:24:37.642
we're the voice of the people
making fun of the people.

00:24:37.726 --> 00:24:39.769
Thanks, but l can't
be on the paper

00:24:39.854 --> 00:24:42.397
because l'm gonna be
in the paper a lot.

00:24:42.481 --> 00:24:45.567
So that would be
a conflict of interest.

00:24:47.153 --> 00:24:50.029
You're the people.
Got it.

00:24:52.408 --> 00:24:55.243
Do you believe me now?
That girl is crazy town.

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:57.620
Look! They have wrestling !

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:01.457
That's it! l'm great
at wrestling.

00:25:01.542 --> 00:25:04.794
l've watched it for years,
l know all the moves.

00:25:05.546 --> 00:25:06.921
Tombstone piledriver.

00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:10.091
Chair shot.

00:25:12.595 --> 00:25:13.636
Vader Bomb.

00:25:14.597 --> 00:25:18.474
Heffley! Heffley!
Heffley! Heffley!

00:25:18.559 --> 00:25:21.436
Heffley! Heffley! Heffley!

00:25:24.315 --> 00:25:28.443
Okay. Something
is very wrong here.

00:25:29.111 --> 00:25:31.196
These don't look like
wrestling costumes to me.

00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:35.033
Welcome to wrestling,
you future Olympians!

00:25:35.784 --> 00:25:37.827
So, just to make sure
we all get off
on the right foot

00:25:37.912 --> 00:25:40.663
and nobody gets
seriously injured,

00:25:40.748 --> 00:25:42.457
we're gonna teach you
a few basic moves.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:48.338
Remember, this is about
learning the sport
and having fun !

00:25:48.422 --> 00:25:49.881
All right. lt's not
a competition

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:55.720
because everyone here
is already
a superstar to me.

00:25:56.722 --> 00:25:58.181
Coach Brewer,
can you step over here
for a moment,

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:00.475
please, give me a hand?
Thanks.

00:26:04.104 --> 00:26:06.522
That's known as
a speed takedown.

00:26:06.607 --> 00:26:08.107
Nice job,
Coach Brewer.

00:26:08.192 --> 00:26:10.443
Can you get up and
come behind me?

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:12.862
Put one arm
over my shoulder?
Let's go, yeah.

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:15.114
You got it, walk it off,
come on.

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:19.953
That was known
as the arm drag.

00:26:20.037 --> 00:26:22.664
Let's give Coach Brewer
a hand, everybody!

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.500
He's fine.

00:26:27.544 --> 00:26:29.003
Yeah, Heffley.

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:32.173
What about piledrivers
and Vader bombs?

00:26:32.258 --> 00:26:34.759
That is fake wrestling.

00:26:36.512 --> 00:26:39.264
This is real wrestling !
Let's go!

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:42.934
lf l have to wrestle
Benny Wells,
he'll kill me!

00:26:43.018 --> 00:26:44.769
Let's move! Come on !

00:26:45.354 --> 00:26:48.982
Okay, to keep things fair,
l've divided you into weight
categories by your size,

00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:51.985
so Rottweilers over here.

00:26:52.069 --> 00:26:53.945
Bulldogs, you stay
right there.

00:26:54.029 --> 00:26:55.697
And we got two

00:26:57.366 --> 00:26:59.075
Chihuahuas. Yeah.

00:26:59.368 --> 00:27:00.952
Nice head gear.

00:27:01.036 --> 00:27:03.329
Thanks. My mom
let me borrow it.

00:27:04.248 --> 00:27:05.498
All right, let's see
what you got.

00:27:06.667 --> 00:27:08.626
Don't worry, Fregley,
l'll take it easy on you.

00:27:11.338 --> 00:27:12.714
Hey, l wasn't ready!

00:27:12.798 --> 00:27:17.051
Nobody's keeping score,
but that was a sweet
speed takedown, Fregley!

00:27:20.764 --> 00:27:22.640
This is fun,
Greg Heffley!

00:27:24.727 --> 00:27:26.060
Get off me!

00:27:29.023 --> 00:27:31.357
Fregley! Fregley! Fregley!

00:27:33.068 --> 00:27:35.153
Blow the whistle,
blow the whistle!

00:27:35.362 --> 00:27:37.488
All right! Fregley!

00:27:40.117 --> 00:27:42.243
Outstanding !

00:27:44.413 --> 00:27:47.623
And let's. . .
Let's hear it
for our other winner.

00:27:49.376 --> 00:27:51.044
Yay, Greg !

00:27:52.296 --> 00:27:53.921
l can't lose
to Fregley again.

00:27:54.006 --> 00:27:56.007
lf l get beat by
the weirdest kid
in school,

00:27:56.091 --> 00:27:58.593
nobody's ever gonna let me
sit at their table.

00:27:58.677 --> 00:28:00.053
How are you
going to beat him?

00:28:00.137 --> 00:28:02.263
lt's like he had
superhuman strength !

00:28:02.598 --> 00:28:05.141
l'm not gonna beat him.
l'm gonna gain
1 0 pounds this week

00:28:05.225 --> 00:28:07.268
so l can move up to
the Bulldog weight class.

00:28:07.353 --> 00:28:10.063
And then you and l
can wrestle each other.

00:28:10.147 --> 00:28:11.522
Ready?

00:28:11.607 --> 00:28:13.483
Can l throw at you now?
Later.

00:28:13.692 --> 00:28:16.903
You're better at riding
than l am,
and l'm a better thrower.

00:28:29.958 --> 00:28:32.502
Greg, save some
for everybody else, honey.

00:28:32.586 --> 00:28:34.545
Can't.
l need to bulk up.

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:35.630
Why?

00:28:36.256 --> 00:28:39.258
l think your body
looks beautiful
just the way it is.

00:28:39.385 --> 00:28:43.012
l heard he got his butt
kicked at wrestling.
Now what is wrong with you?

00:28:43.097 --> 00:28:46.474
Why would you sign up
for something
you don't have to do?

00:28:46.642 --> 00:28:48.893
You signed up for wrestling?

00:28:49.103 --> 00:28:50.103
Kind of.

00:28:50.187 --> 00:28:52.730
You never sign up
for anything at school.

00:28:52.815 --> 00:28:54.774
You fly below the radar.

00:28:54.858 --> 00:28:57.902
That way you never raise
anyone's expectations.

00:28:57.986 --> 00:29:00.947
Thank you, Rodrick,
for those words
of motivational wisdom,

00:29:01.031 --> 00:29:03.032
but perhaps
a better way
to look at it is that

00:29:03.117 --> 00:29:06.285
it's a chance
to learn to excel
at something.

00:29:06.370 --> 00:29:09.664
Well, what could
l learn at school that
l can't teach myself?

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:12.333
Well, Greg, l think
it's great that

00:29:12.418 --> 00:29:14.710
you took the initiative
to learn something new.

00:29:14.795 --> 00:29:17.964
This is like the first step
to responsibility!

00:29:18.048 --> 00:29:21.592
My boss's son Will
was smaller than you,

00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:24.470
but he built himself up
with the weights!

00:29:24.555 --> 00:29:26.722
Yeah.
We could get you
the same equipment.

00:29:26.807 --> 00:29:31.227
You could train,
get the right
nutrition, cardio.

00:29:31.562 --> 00:29:35.189
You'd be in tip-top shape
just like Will.

00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:40.236
And it would only take,
like, three months.

00:29:45.117 --> 00:29:46.284
Three months?

00:29:46.368 --> 00:29:47.452
Yeah.

00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:50.621
l'll just stick to eating.

00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.670
Well, l don't know where
you put it, Heffley,

00:29:57.754 --> 00:30:00.298
but you gained 1 0 pounds
and joined
the Bulldog class.

00:30:00.382 --> 00:30:01.507
Yes.

00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:10.641
l thought
you didn't gain
any weight this week.

00:30:10.726 --> 00:30:12.518
My mom's
ankle weights.

00:30:14.897 --> 00:30:18.566
All right, bulldog Heffley.
Meet your new opponent.

00:30:20.986 --> 00:30:23.404
What? But this is
boys' wrestling.

00:30:23.614 --> 00:30:25.740
Ever hear
of Title lX?

00:30:25.908 --> 00:30:27.533
Her parents
threatened to sue,

00:30:27.618 --> 00:30:31.454
so you show her
what it's like to wrestle
a real live boy.

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.254
Come on ! What you
waiting for, huh?

00:30:40.339 --> 00:30:42.215
Don't be such
a wuss, Heffley.

00:30:42.299 --> 00:30:43.591
Make your move!

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:45.760
She's a girl !
Where do l grab her?

00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:51.432
Stay down !
Patty, over here!

00:30:55.437 --> 00:30:56.604
Get off of me!

00:30:56.688 --> 00:30:58.439
Can l wrestle
somebody good now?

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.035
Well, look who's
in the paper.

00:31:11.954 --> 00:31:16.916
Greg ! You're famous!
Right on the front page!

00:31:25.842 --> 00:31:27.134
And if l would
have pinned her,

00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:28.719
which l could have
done easily,

00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:31.264
you know l would have
gotten in trouble
for hurting a girl.

00:31:31.348 --> 00:31:33.599
Why does she even
want to wrestle?

00:31:33.684 --> 00:31:35.810
Who knows?
Girls are very confusing.

00:31:35.894 --> 00:31:37.436
Like today,
l heard someone
in the hallway say

00:31:37.521 --> 00:31:41.524
that Bryce Anderson
has a cute butt.
What does that even mean?

00:31:41.608 --> 00:31:44.026
A butt can't be cute.
lt's a butt.

00:31:44.653 --> 00:31:47.280
l know, but that's what
they were saying.

00:31:47.364 --> 00:31:50.199
l don't see why
girls our age can't talk
just like regular people.

00:31:55.998 --> 00:31:59.000
So how are you
gonna become
a class favorite now?

00:31:59.084 --> 00:32:00.960
Two words.
Best Dressed.

00:32:01.044 --> 00:32:02.795
How are you
going to do that?

00:32:03.088 --> 00:32:04.255
Fashion is easy.

00:32:04.339 --> 00:32:06.841
You wear a shirt and a tie,
and kids are impressed.

00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:09.468
l'm telling you,
this is gonna work.

00:32:10.304 --> 00:32:13.723
l light 'em up
before the motor starts

00:32:13.807 --> 00:32:17.476
l go so fast
that l could never stop

00:32:17.561 --> 00:32:20.438
Look under the hood
but you don't know what l got

00:32:20.522 --> 00:32:22.607
l'm a moving violation, baby

00:32:22.691 --> 00:32:25.276
Hot, hot, hot, hot

00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:32.074
Ta-da!

00:32:32.659 --> 00:32:34.118
l told you
l was wearing this.

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:35.202
l know!

00:32:35.287 --> 00:32:36.787
l wanted to be matchers!

00:32:36.872 --> 00:32:38.205
Check them out!

00:32:39.708 --> 00:32:43.169
Greg and RowIey
sitting in a tree

00:32:43.253 --> 00:32:46.589
K-I-S-S-I-N-G

00:32:47.215 --> 00:32:48.966
First comes Iove...

00:32:49.051 --> 00:32:52.094
You know,
maybe Rodrick was right
about Rowley.

00:32:52.971 --> 00:32:55.473
Maybe l do need
a new best friend.

00:32:55.557 --> 00:32:58.267
But l can't just ditch him.

00:32:58.352 --> 00:33:01.812
l mean, if anybody
has a better idea,
I'd Iove to hear it.

00:33:03.357 --> 00:33:05.316
ln this school,
much like your own,

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:08.069
one boy is about to learn
an important lesson

00:33:08.153 --> 00:33:10.029
about seIf-worth and esteem.

00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:12.281
Gag me with a spoon.

00:33:12.366 --> 00:33:15.451
That guy is so unpopular,
I'd hate to be him.

00:33:18.205 --> 00:33:19.830
Why doesn't
anybody like me?

00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:23.501
Maybe because
they don't know
how awesome you really are.

00:33:24.378 --> 00:33:27.755
Brock Branigan P.l.!
What are you doing here?

00:33:28.215 --> 00:33:31.676
I'm here to soIve the case
of the boy who just
needed to be himseIf.

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.262
So go for it!
Show them how awesome
you really are!

00:33:38.684 --> 00:33:41.352
Hey, guys.
Do you like break dancing?

00:33:57.411 --> 00:33:59.704
That is totally rad!

00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:03.124
Wicked.
You shouId sit with us
at Iunch, friend.

00:34:07.170 --> 00:34:08.421
Sweet!

00:34:09.673 --> 00:34:12.633
lt really is awesome
to be me!
Thanks, Brock.

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:28.149
Okay. Let's talk about
what we've learned.

00:34:28.233 --> 00:34:31.318
l don't know
about anyone else,
but I know what I Iearned.

00:34:31.403 --> 00:34:33.362
It is awesome to be me.

00:34:33.697 --> 00:34:37.283
The problem with Rowley is
that he's not enough like me.

00:34:37.367 --> 00:34:40.286
I can't ditch him
'cause he'd be Iost
without me.

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:43.998
But maybe l can fix him.

00:34:46.376 --> 00:34:49.170
Because that's
the kind of friend I am.

00:34:49.337 --> 00:34:50.880
What are you doing?

00:34:50.964 --> 00:34:53.257
Making your clothes more
middle-school friendly.

00:34:53.341 --> 00:34:56.927
Look at this stuff.
Too babyish and weird.

00:34:57.345 --> 00:35:00.264
Too "Why don't you
just punch me now?"

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.351
What are you,
a foreign exchange student?

00:35:05.437 --> 00:35:08.355
Oh, man.
This one we burn.

00:35:08.648 --> 00:35:10.649
That was a present
from my mom.

00:35:10.734 --> 00:35:13.611
Well, then your mom
is trying to
get you killed.

00:35:13.695 --> 00:35:15.404
Ready?
Steady. Go.

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:22.077
No, no, no.
You look like one of
the Seven Dwarfs.

00:35:22.162 --> 00:35:25.915
You only need one strap.
One strap is cool.

00:35:26.333 --> 00:35:27.541
But there's two straps.

00:35:27.626 --> 00:35:28.834
Why would they
put on two straps

00:35:28.919 --> 00:35:30.711
if you're only
supposed to use one?

00:35:30.796 --> 00:35:33.422
Because the guys
who make backpacks
aren't cool.

00:35:33.507 --> 00:35:35.132
lf they were cool,
they'd give it
one strap,

00:35:35.217 --> 00:35:37.593
like the cool
one-strap guys do.

00:35:37.677 --> 00:35:40.471
You know what has one strap?
Machine guns.

00:35:40.555 --> 00:35:43.432
You know what else?
Electric guitars.

00:35:43.517 --> 00:35:44.975
You know what else?

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:46.101
Purses?

00:35:46.895 --> 00:35:48.395
But Joshie is cool.

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:50.314
Rowley,
Joshie is not cool.

00:35:50.398 --> 00:35:53.067
He's a lip-synching pop star
whose fans are
eight-year-old girls.

00:35:53.151 --> 00:35:56.111
You're just jealous
that l was the one
who discovered him.

00:35:56.196 --> 00:35:59.156
Who are you
gonna listen to, Rowley?
Me or Joshie?

00:35:59.241 --> 00:36:02.785
Joshie says to
respect your parents
and follow your dreams.

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.538
Then Joshie must get
beaten up a lot.

00:36:13.547 --> 00:36:15.673
You actually almost
look as good as me.

00:36:15.757 --> 00:36:17.842
Am l great at this
or what?

00:36:19.261 --> 00:36:22.263
There's Bryce Anderson.
Just be cool.

00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.765
Hey, Bryce.

00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.309
Yeah, hey, Bryce!

00:36:28.353 --> 00:36:29.728
Cute butt!

00:36:33.608 --> 00:36:35.609
You're killing me,
you know that?

00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:37.695
Look, Rowley,
tonight's Halloween,

00:36:37.779 --> 00:36:38.988
our favorite night
of the year,

00:36:39.072 --> 00:36:43.284
so, just promise me
you won't wear, do
or say anything weird.

00:36:47.956 --> 00:36:49.957
You're kidding me, right?

00:36:50.125 --> 00:36:53.419
My mom wanted me
to be visible at night.

00:36:54.921 --> 00:36:56.630
From space?

00:36:57.507 --> 00:37:00.718
So, we'll hit a few houses
on the way to the North Side,

00:37:00.802 --> 00:37:03.095
which is where we'll do
most of
our trick-or-treating.

00:37:03.179 --> 00:37:05.681
Why are we going
all the way over there?

00:37:05.765 --> 00:37:07.391
lt's where
the rich people live.

00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:11.353
They hand out, like,
two, three pieces of
big candy to each kid.

00:37:11.438 --> 00:37:13.480
Not that
candy corn crap.

00:37:14.274 --> 00:37:17.818
l'm talking about
full-size Milky Ways
and Nutter Butters.

00:37:17.903 --> 00:37:19.570
Plus, if we time it right,

00:37:19.654 --> 00:37:23.782
rich people get tired
of answering their doors
and just leave the bowl out.

00:37:23.867 --> 00:37:25.492
We can clean up.

00:37:27.329 --> 00:37:29.079
Wow, you're lucky.

00:37:29.164 --> 00:37:32.082
My mom doesn't let me play
with makeup anymore.

00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:35.836
Shut up, tool.
Löded Diper's
got a gig tonight.

00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:41.675
Mmm.

00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:44.094
Going to
the North Side, huh?

00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:46.764
Takes you right past
the Devil Worshiper Woods.

00:37:46.848 --> 00:37:48.432
The Devil
Worshiper Woods?

00:37:49.351 --> 00:37:51.018
You know about
that story, right?

00:37:52.354 --> 00:37:56.941
Well, there used to be
this house right here
where these woods are.

00:37:57.525 --> 00:38:01.153
They had to tear it down
because what happened there
was so terrible.

00:38:01.237 --> 00:38:02.780
What happened there?

00:38:02.864 --> 00:38:07.201
Well, a long time ago,
two kids who were,
l don't know,

00:38:08.036 --> 00:38:10.037
maybe in middle school,

00:38:10.538 --> 00:38:13.791
they trick-or-treated
at that house
on Halloween night.

00:38:13.875 --> 00:38:20.089
But the house was full
of devil worshipers

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.510
who put the kids
in these giant pizza ovens.

00:38:24.636 --> 00:38:28.055
And they cooked them
and they ate them.

00:38:28.890 --> 00:38:31.308
But they forgot
to turn off the ovens.

00:38:31.393 --> 00:38:34.687
So the house burned down
with everyone in it.

00:38:35.563 --> 00:38:37.564
How'd the trees
get there?

00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:40.943
And then they planted trees.

00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:42.653
Oh.

00:38:42.737 --> 00:38:46.115
And to this day,
on Halloween night,

00:38:46.783 --> 00:38:51.412
you can still hear
the demonic laughter
of the devil worshiper ghosts

00:38:51.496 --> 00:38:56.834
as they roam the woods,
looking for more kids
to sacrifice!

00:38:57.085 --> 00:39:00.254
Hey, Rodrick.
l need you to
help me out. Like. . .

00:39:02.799 --> 00:39:05.300
Are you wearing eyeliner?

00:39:05.844 --> 00:39:06.844
Trick or treat.

00:39:06.928 --> 00:39:07.928
Susan !

00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:09.304
l'm on door duty!

00:39:09.389 --> 00:39:10.556
Thank you.

00:39:11.975 --> 00:39:13.475
Bubby!

00:39:13.685 --> 00:39:15.978
Mom, can you tell him
to stop calling me that?

00:39:16.062 --> 00:39:17.646
What if somebody hears?

00:39:17.731 --> 00:39:20.524
Then they'll know
how much he loves you.

00:39:21.609 --> 00:39:24.862
Frank, Frank,
honey, honey,
can you go with them?

00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:26.739
No, l can't.
l got to
guard the house

00:39:26.823 --> 00:39:28.198


00:39:28.283 --> 00:39:30.159
They're gonna get
drenched from the roof.

00:39:31.411 --> 00:39:34.038
Honey, for goodness sakes,
don't do that again.

00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:35.706
Remember what happened
last year?

00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:38.125
l got you !

00:39:42.505 --> 00:39:43.630
Hi.

00:39:46.593 --> 00:39:48.343
l thought
they were teenagers.

00:39:48.428 --> 00:39:49.970
And l couldn't see
through the bushes.

00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:52.056
My legs, they hurt
from the squatting.

00:39:52.140 --> 00:39:55.476
So, that's why
l'm doing it from
the roof this year.

00:39:55.977 --> 00:39:58.604
So l can see
when they're coming.

00:40:01.316 --> 00:40:02.357
Can we go now?

00:40:03.485 --> 00:40:04.985
Yes, go.

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.196
But stay
in the neighborhood.

00:40:07.489 --> 00:40:08.572
Trick or treat.

00:40:08.656 --> 00:40:10.032
And no North Side!

00:40:10.116 --> 00:40:11.366
We promise!

00:40:27.675 --> 00:40:29.718
We got to stay
in this neighborhood
the rest of the night.

00:40:29.803 --> 00:40:32.679
That guy gave me
two full-size Snickers!

00:40:32.764 --> 00:40:34.807
Did l tell you
or did l tell you?

00:40:34.891 --> 00:40:36.850
These people have
money to burn !

00:40:38.019 --> 00:40:39.978
l can't believe
we got this much candy.

00:40:40.522 --> 00:40:42.022
This is, like,
the best day ever.

00:40:42.107 --> 00:40:45.067
Hey, reflector dude,
nice costume!

00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:47.027
Thanks!
My mom made it. . .

00:40:53.701 --> 00:40:55.452
Oh, that was awesome!

00:40:55.537 --> 00:40:57.830
l saw your plates!
We're calling the cops!

00:41:00.375 --> 00:41:01.458
Uh-oh.

00:41:03.044 --> 00:41:04.253
Oh, boy.

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:07.589
Run !

00:41:11.719 --> 00:41:13.637
Hey, they're going
through the yard !

00:41:13.721 --> 00:41:15.848
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go!

00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:20.936
Where are we going?
We're totally exposed !

00:41:23.857 --> 00:41:25.440
My grandma's house!

00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:26.775
Quickly!

00:41:27.026 --> 00:41:28.569
They're coming !

00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:32.656
Hello?

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:33.907
That's not helping !
She's not home!

00:41:34.033 --> 00:41:35.617
Bingo night.
Okay,
you guys are dead.

00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:37.536
Open the door!
Get the key!
Okay. Okay.

00:41:37.662 --> 00:41:39.454
Open the door!
Get it!
Come on, let's get them, boys.

00:41:39.539 --> 00:41:41.081
They're coming !

00:41:41.916 --> 00:41:43.709
- Now!
- Oh, l got you now!

00:41:43.793 --> 00:41:45.085
Hey, hey!

00:41:47.422 --> 00:41:49.381
Come on, you babies!

00:41:51.759 --> 00:41:52.843
l'm gonna
kick your butts!

00:41:54.888 --> 00:41:56.847
Yeah? You and what army?

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:58.724
Whatever.

00:42:03.938 --> 00:42:07.024
You guys are so lucky
you can hide in there
behind your mommy!

00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:08.901
No, we aren't!
lt's not our house!

00:42:08.985 --> 00:42:11.820
lt's his grandma's
and she's not even home!

00:42:15.408 --> 00:42:18.118
What? Why would
you tell them that?

00:42:18.203 --> 00:42:19.453
Did he just say that?

00:42:19.537 --> 00:42:20.537
Oops.

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:26.335
Now they're
never gonna leave.

00:42:26.419 --> 00:42:28.045
You need to
call your mom
to come get us.

00:42:28.129 --> 00:42:30.589
Mine'll kill me
if she knows
we're here.

00:42:30.673 --> 00:42:33.926
Mine will, too.
She thinks
you're a bad influence.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.803
She's right.

00:42:38.097 --> 00:42:40.015
Then we're gonna have
to bust out of here.

00:42:40.892 --> 00:42:42.392
You have any threes?

00:42:43.436 --> 00:42:44.645
Go fish.

00:42:48.399 --> 00:42:50.275
Hey, what's that?

00:42:56.532 --> 00:42:58.408
Danger, danger

00:42:59.285 --> 00:43:00.744
High Voltage

00:43:04.374 --> 00:43:05.999
Danger, danger

00:43:07.085 --> 00:43:08.585
High Voltage

00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:16.468
Just back off!
l don't want to
hurt anybody,

00:43:16.552 --> 00:43:19.596
we just want to
walk away and forget
this ever happened.

00:43:19.681 --> 00:43:22.015
Nobody needs to be
a hero! Whoa!

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.276
Are you kidding me?

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:36.905
l'm gonna rip off your arms
and punch you in the face
with your own fists!

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:44.329
They're gaining !
This way!

00:43:50.336 --> 00:43:53.130
The Devil Worshiper Woods!
No way!

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:57.384
Hey! Stay right there!
We're gonna get you !

00:44:00.138 --> 00:44:02.180
They're going
into the woods.

00:44:02.265 --> 00:44:05.600
No, no way l go
into Devil Worshiper Woods.
Uh-uh.

00:44:06.978 --> 00:44:08.603
This isn't over!

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:13.734
l'm really scared !

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:15.068
Just keep running !

00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:25.787
Did you hear that?
lt's the devil worshipers.

00:44:45.558 --> 00:44:46.725
Guys?

00:44:55.193 --> 00:44:56.693
Are we safe?
Yeah.

00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:59.654
And we made it with
still a ton of candy.

00:45:02.283 --> 00:45:05.911
Sorry. l was. . .
l thought
you were teenagers.

00:45:09.165 --> 00:45:10.540
Maybe next year, Pops!

00:45:10.625 --> 00:45:11.708
Hey!

00:45:26.015 --> 00:45:29.226
So anyone eIse
exhibiting symptoms
of pink eye

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:31.686
shouId contact
the nurse immediately.

00:45:31.771 --> 00:45:34.815
ln field trip news,
consent forms
are going out today

00:45:34.899 --> 00:45:38.193
for our annuaI
History of Plumbing excursion.

00:45:38.277 --> 00:45:39.486
ln sports news...

00:45:40.488 --> 00:45:45.492
I think Shelly is looking hot today.

00:45:46.202 --> 00:45:47.577
Yeah.

00:45:47.662 --> 00:45:49.579
Are they
talking about me?

00:45:49.664 --> 00:45:51.706
l don't know.
l don't speak Russian.

00:45:52.875 --> 00:45:57.629
And finally, some positions
have opened up
for the Safety PatroI.

00:45:57.713 --> 00:46:01.550
lf anyone is interested,
see Mr. Winsky after homeroom.

00:46:01.634 --> 00:46:03.802
Now that's what
l'm talking about.

00:46:05.012 --> 00:46:08.348
Safety PatroI.
The cops of middle school.

00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.976
You boss people around,

00:46:11.060 --> 00:46:15.188
report the jerks,
and miss cIass
three times a week.

00:46:19.986 --> 00:46:21.820
Safety Patrol
is a sacred trust.

00:46:21.904 --> 00:46:25.949
When you put on this vest
and that badge you become
a protector of the weak.

00:46:26.033 --> 00:46:29.619
You become
an enforcer of the laws
of this school,

00:46:29.704 --> 00:46:32.873
because today's litterer
and jaywalker

00:46:32.957 --> 00:46:35.459
is tomorrow's
window breaker
and graffiti vandal,

00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:37.752
and it's our job
to stop it.

00:46:37.837 --> 00:46:40.839
So l ask you,
are you up for the job?

00:46:41.841 --> 00:46:43.216
Yes!
Yes!

00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:46.303
Then welcome
to Safety Patrol.

00:46:46.387 --> 00:46:49.306
Just remember,
with great power. . .

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:50.390
Whoa.

00:46:50.475 --> 00:46:52.684
. . .comes
great responsibility.

00:46:53.561 --> 00:46:56.229
Now, you get
your first assignment
just after lunch,

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:58.356
so you'll be excused
from the first 20 minutes
of sixth period.

00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:00.025
But that means
we'll miss Algebra. . .

00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:01.318
Ouch !

00:47:01.402 --> 00:47:02.903
Do we get
free stuff?

00:47:03.905 --> 00:47:04.988
Free hot cocoa.

00:47:05.072 --> 00:47:07.199
Could this day
get any better?

00:47:07.283 --> 00:47:08.992
Whoa, is that cocoa?

00:47:09.076 --> 00:47:10.869
Sorry, Safety
Patrol only.

00:47:10.953 --> 00:47:12.120
Sorry.

00:47:15.374 --> 00:47:17.167
You rejected
the school paper,

00:47:17.251 --> 00:47:19.586
but you joined
the Safety Patrol?

00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:21.755
Look, are you working
your way down
the evolutionary ladder?

00:47:21.839 --> 00:47:22.881
What?

00:47:22.965 --> 00:47:26.426
Look, Safety Patrol
is the lowest of the low,

00:47:26.511 --> 00:47:29.596
the geekiest of the geeky,
the lsland of Misfit Toys.

00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:32.516
You're just jealous
they don't trust you
to keep our school safe.

00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:36.269
Now if you'll excuse me,
l need to
secure the perimeter.

00:47:40.399 --> 00:47:41.733
l'm hungry.

00:47:41.817 --> 00:47:43.109
Keep it
straight, people.

00:47:43.194 --> 00:47:45.862
Single-file line,
one by one.

00:47:53.788 --> 00:47:56.790
Greg ! lt's those guys
from Halloween !

00:47:57.959 --> 00:47:59.459
What do we do?

00:48:02.463 --> 00:48:04.047
Come on, man,
just pull my finger.

00:48:04.131 --> 00:48:05.882
l swear to God,
l'm not gonna
do anything.

00:48:05.967 --> 00:48:08.677
Everybody,
shoulder to shoulder.
Shoulder to shoulder.

00:48:08.761 --> 00:48:10.720
Go. Go!
Whoa, whoa.

00:48:23.442 --> 00:48:25.402
That was close.

00:48:25.486 --> 00:48:26.820
Too close.

00:48:30.449 --> 00:48:33.410
lt's times like these
that make me reaIize

00:48:33.578 --> 00:48:36.621
Rowley's pretty lucky
to have me as a friend.

00:48:39.166 --> 00:48:42.460
And l got
Twisted Wizard Two,
and a new bike!

00:48:43.212 --> 00:48:47.424
And we're going to take
a family trip to New York City
for New Year's Eve!

00:48:47.508 --> 00:48:49.217
What did you get?

00:48:49.302 --> 00:48:51.469
My dad got me
a weight-lifting set.

00:48:51.554 --> 00:48:54.514
Do you know
how many video games
l could've gotten instead?

00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:58.602
l had to get out of there
before he expected me
to, like, use it.

00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:02.063
Anyway, let's play
some Twisted Wizard Two
at your house.

00:49:02.148 --> 00:49:03.940
Probably not a good idea.

00:49:04.025 --> 00:49:06.109
My dad's
still annoyed at you.

00:49:06.193 --> 00:49:07.360
For what?

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:10.322
Remember that secret language
we made up last week?

00:49:11.324 --> 00:49:15.076
Your-pa dad-pa smells-pa
like-pa a woman-pa.

00:49:18.205 --> 00:49:20.457
l think
he cracked our code.

00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:22.542
We should probably
do something outside.

00:49:24.712 --> 00:49:27.589
Why can't you ride
and l throw
at you first?

00:49:28.049 --> 00:49:30.425
My legs kind of hurt
from walking over here.

00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.445
Okay, Rowley.
Come on. Get up.

00:49:51.697 --> 00:49:53.281
Shake it off.

00:49:54.617 --> 00:49:56.493
Are you sure
the doctor was right?

00:49:56.577 --> 00:49:58.620
lt really didn't look
that broken to me.

00:49:58.704 --> 00:50:03.166
Yeah, it's broken.
The X-ray never lies.

00:50:05.378 --> 00:50:07.587
Oh, my gosh.
What happened?

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:09.339
l broke it.

00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:10.465
How?

00:50:10.549 --> 00:50:12.258
Big Wheel accident.

00:50:13.219 --> 00:50:14.844
You're funny.

00:50:14.929 --> 00:50:16.763
Can l sign your cast?
Me, too.

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.056
l wanna sign it, too.

00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:19.474
Why, sure.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:22.143
Hey, l'm the one
who broke his hand.

00:50:22.895 --> 00:50:24.604
Then you're a jerk.

00:50:25.439 --> 00:50:27.232
Sorry.
Does it hurt?

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:32.862
Rowley, you're so funny.

00:50:34.448 --> 00:50:35.490
After l stood. . .

00:50:35.574 --> 00:50:36.741
l couldn't believe it!

00:50:36.826 --> 00:50:41.413
Rowley was eating
at an actuaI tabIe
because of something l did!

00:50:42.164 --> 00:50:43.915
Where's my credit?

00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:47.877
And he's right handed!
He can feed himself just fine.

00:50:50.798 --> 00:50:53.925
So, how's that
class favorite thing
working out for you?

00:50:54.009 --> 00:50:55.301
Great.

00:51:12.236 --> 00:51:15.905
I reaIized
Rowley's injury thing
was a pretty good racket.

00:51:19.994 --> 00:51:21.077
lt's gonna be
so much fun.

00:51:21.162 --> 00:51:23.079
Hey, guys.
Check it out.

00:51:23.914 --> 00:51:25.707
Oh, my gosh,
what happened?

00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:30.044
lt's a raging infection
caused by a splinter
that was left untreated.

00:51:30.463 --> 00:51:33.506
Want to be the first to sign
my sympathy sheet?

00:51:33.841 --> 00:51:34.883
No.

00:51:38.179 --> 00:51:42.348
l'll sign it, Greg Heffley,
if you'd let me
look at your infection.

00:51:46.687 --> 00:51:50.273
And on the X-ray,
you could see where the bone
just snapped right in half.

00:51:50.357 --> 00:51:54.068
l had the exact
same break last year,
and it got all purple!

00:51:54.195 --> 00:51:55.779
Cool !
Mine, too!

00:51:55.863 --> 00:51:57.989
Hey, Gregory,
want to sign the card?

00:51:58.365 --> 00:52:00.366
You got
Rowley a card?

00:52:00.534 --> 00:52:03.119
What? No, it's for
Bryan Little.

00:52:03.204 --> 00:52:05.538
You know, the guy who writes
the Wacky Dawg cartoons

00:52:05.623 --> 00:52:07.373
for the school paper?

00:52:07.458 --> 00:52:11.002
He has mono
and he's going to be out
for three months.

00:52:11.462 --> 00:52:13.463
That really stinks.

00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:17.300
So, just out of curiosity,
who's gonna do the cartoon?

00:52:17.635 --> 00:52:21.888
They're having tryouts,
but the important thing
is Bryan gets better.

00:52:22.181 --> 00:52:23.556
Absolutely.

00:52:25.601 --> 00:52:28.186
Bryan Little getting mono
was destiny.

00:52:28.312 --> 00:52:31.773
I draw cartoons aII the time.
l'm gonna win this.

00:52:42.034 --> 00:52:46.204
l decided to go ahead
and forgive Rowley for milking
the broken hand so hard

00:52:46.288 --> 00:52:49.249
and I toId him
he couId work on the cartoon
with me.

00:52:50.125 --> 00:52:53.419
So, l was thinking
we could do
something like this!

00:52:53.712 --> 00:52:55.880
Oops, I stepped
in a puddle!

00:52:55.965 --> 00:52:58.424
At Ieast it's not
an acid puddle.

00:52:58.551 --> 00:53:00.969
Oy, oy, oy!
lt is an acid puddle!

00:53:01.053 --> 00:53:06.140
Zoo-wee Mama!

00:53:07.852 --> 00:53:10.228
lt's the same joke
every time.

00:53:10.312 --> 00:53:12.897
Yeah ! Zoo-wee Mama!

00:53:13.816 --> 00:53:16.276
We can't just do
the same thing
over and over.

00:53:16.360 --> 00:53:18.152
We can if it's
Zoo-wee Mama.

00:53:18.237 --> 00:53:21.197
lt has to be
a little more
sophisticated.

00:53:21.532 --> 00:53:24.284
I wonder what is in
this cute IittIe box.

00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:25.577
It's not a box,

00:53:25.661 --> 00:53:27.036
it's a brick,
you dumb moron.

00:53:27.121 --> 00:53:30.164
Oops! I've been
trying to open it all day!

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:35.086
Can he say,
"Zoo-wee Mama"?

00:53:35.588 --> 00:53:37.213
No, it's not funny.

00:53:37.298 --> 00:53:40.216
Well, l think it is.
l like Zoo-wee Mama.

00:53:40.342 --> 00:53:41.342
You know what?

00:53:41.427 --> 00:53:44.971
lf you like it so much,
then why don't
you go do it yourself?

00:53:48.183 --> 00:53:51.477
Okay. l will.

00:53:52.855 --> 00:53:54.105
See you.

00:54:05.034 --> 00:54:08.953
Hey, l forgot my raincoat,
so l'm gonna need you to
walk the kids home today.

00:54:09.038 --> 00:54:11.414
l can't. l can't
get my cast wet.

00:54:12.416 --> 00:54:14.292
You can borrow
my coat.

00:54:17.963 --> 00:54:20.006
Where's Rowley?

00:54:20.215 --> 00:54:21.925
He couldn't
get his cast wet!

00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:23.760
He walks us better!

00:54:30.809 --> 00:54:31.976
Oh, no.

00:54:37.566 --> 00:54:39.776
Oh, my gosh !
Space monsters!

00:54:40.027 --> 00:54:44.072
They're going to eat us,
unless we can
get into that hole!

00:54:44.239 --> 00:54:47.575
Come on, people, move it!
Now, people!
We're gonna get eaten !

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:50.411
Come on ! Don't worry!
l'm right behind you !

00:54:50.496 --> 00:54:51.871
Whoa!
Go!

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:05.259
Hey!

00:55:06.220 --> 00:55:08.638
Rowley Jefferson,
is that you?

00:55:09.890 --> 00:55:12.392
Yes, Mrs. lrvine!

00:55:16.146 --> 00:55:17.689
Sorry, kids!

00:55:25.823 --> 00:55:27.824
Are you going to
eat us?

00:55:28.909 --> 00:55:33.287
And though doctors assure us
that Mrs. Cheznik
is no longer contagious,

00:55:33.372 --> 00:55:37.750
the cafeteria nachos bar
wiII be cIosed
for the remainder of the week.

00:55:38.085 --> 00:55:40.461
And now, what you've all
been waiting for.

00:55:40.629 --> 00:55:44.632
The facuIty, Student CounciI
and editors have aII met

00:55:44.717 --> 00:55:48.094
and seIected
the new cartoonist
for the school paper.

00:55:49.054 --> 00:55:50.680
And the winner is

00:55:51.432 --> 00:55:54.392
"Zoo-wee Mama"
by Rowley Jefferson!

00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:00.231
What?

00:56:00.315 --> 00:56:01.649
That is funny!

00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:03.943
Great job.

00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:06.237
Zoo-wee Mama.

00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:07.905
l couldn't believe it.

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:11.534
Am l the only one
who gets comedy?

00:56:11.618 --> 00:56:13.327
Rowley, will you
put me
in your cartoon?

00:56:13.412 --> 00:56:14.495
Sure.

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:17.540
And me, too.
l want to be the one
who says, "Zoo-wee Mama."

00:56:17.624 --> 00:56:18.875
You got it!

00:56:18.959 --> 00:56:20.418
Hey, Rowley,
congratulations.

00:56:20.502 --> 00:56:21.669
Thanks.
No problem.

00:56:21.754 --> 00:56:24.547
You know, l read
all the submissions and yours
was by far the best.

00:56:24.631 --> 00:56:26.424
l read yours, too.

00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:27.967
Hey, Rowley.

00:56:28.052 --> 00:56:29.093
Hey, Bryce.

00:56:29.178 --> 00:56:30.887
Yeah, hey, Bryce.

00:56:30.971 --> 00:56:32.889
Hey, fella.

00:56:33.766 --> 00:56:36.684
Wow. Everyone knows me now.

00:56:37.269 --> 00:56:40.104
lt's like l'm famous!
lsn't this great?

00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:41.939
Yeah.

00:56:42.274 --> 00:56:46.277
Rowley Jefferson?
l need to see you
in my office, now.

00:56:57.956 --> 00:56:59.916
l just took a call
from a Mrs. lrvine

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.668
about what happened
to the kindergarteners
last week.

00:57:02.753 --> 00:57:05.505
She was very upset.
And so am l.

00:57:06.381 --> 00:57:07.381
What?

00:57:07.466 --> 00:57:09.342
You violated
the sacred trust.

00:57:10.719 --> 00:57:12.011
This. . .

00:57:14.348 --> 00:57:18.267
This badge is supposed
to mean something,
and you just spat on it.

00:57:18.352 --> 00:57:20.394
l can barely even
look at you.

00:57:20.479 --> 00:57:21.437
l really don't. . .

00:57:21.522 --> 00:57:22.814
Just save it.

00:57:23.023 --> 00:57:26.109
You are officially suspended
from Safety Patrol.

00:57:26.527 --> 00:57:29.821
And l expect a full apology
to the kindergarteners.

00:57:30.614 --> 00:57:31.906
Yes, sir.

00:57:40.833 --> 00:57:43.251
Hey. What did
he have to say?

00:57:43.919 --> 00:57:45.461
l'm kicked off.

00:57:45.838 --> 00:57:48.172
l don't even know
what he's talking about.

00:57:51.135 --> 00:57:52.385
Rowley?

00:57:54.429 --> 00:57:55.555
What?

00:57:56.473 --> 00:57:57.723
Nothing.

00:58:13.574 --> 00:58:17.618
You've been home for an hour
and haven't badgered me
for any snacks.

00:58:17.703 --> 00:58:19.537
Are you feeling okay?

00:58:20.747 --> 00:58:24.458
Well, l'm kind of
in a tough situation.

00:58:25.419 --> 00:58:27.003
l know something

00:58:27.087 --> 00:58:30.173
and if l tell
the truth about it,
it could hurt somebody.

00:58:30.257 --> 00:58:33.342
But if l don't,
it could hurt
somebody else.

00:58:33.427 --> 00:58:38.764
Well, you have to
trust your gut and
try to do the right thing,

00:58:40.392 --> 00:58:44.812
because it's our choices
that make us who we are.

00:58:47.608 --> 00:58:48.774
Okay.

00:58:52.696 --> 00:58:54.113
l was up all night,
tossing and turning,

00:58:54.198 --> 00:58:56.574
thinking about
my mom's advice.

00:58:56.658 --> 00:58:59.619
And l finally decided
to do the right thing.

00:59:00.913 --> 00:59:03.623
l'm sorry
l terrorized you, children.

00:59:04.333 --> 00:59:05.499
What?

00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:09.629
l decided to let Rowley
take one for the team.

00:59:12.841 --> 00:59:17.011
But l'm not entirely sure
that was the right call.

00:59:25.562 --> 00:59:27.021
Hey, how's it going?

00:59:27.105 --> 00:59:31.150
Well, l was pretty upset
about being suspended
from Safety Patrol,

00:59:31.235 --> 00:59:33.653
but then l just started
drawing a bunch
of Zoo-wee Mamas

00:59:33.737 --> 00:59:35.279
and l felt better.

00:59:35.364 --> 00:59:38.324
Look. l put you
in this week's cartoon.

00:59:38.492 --> 00:59:41.285
And you even get to say,
"Zoo-wee Mama."

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:44.413
Wow. That's really

00:59:47.334 --> 00:59:48.501


00:59:49.836 --> 00:59:51.671
So, listen.

00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:55.258
lt's kind of funny, you know,
the whole Safety Patrol thing.

00:59:55.342 --> 00:59:56.467
Yeah?

00:59:57.135 --> 00:59:58.928
Ready for the funny part?

00:59:59.012 --> 01:00:02.431
Well, l'm the one
who terrorized those kids!

01:00:05.269 --> 01:00:06.852
What?
Yeah,

01:00:07.104 --> 01:00:09.939
and l think we can both
learn some valuable lessons
from this.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:14.402
Like, l should be more careful
what l do in front of
Mrs. lrvine's house.

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:16.529
And you, well,

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:20.032
you should be more careful
who you lend your coat to.

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:27.039
You know what, Greg?
You're not
a good friend.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.459
Whoa. How could
you even say that?

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:31.669
l'm a great friend.

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:34.922
lf you were a great friend,
you would have told
Mr. Winsky the truth.

01:00:35.007 --> 01:00:37.717
Okay, one thing.
You can't get mad
about just. . .

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:40.386
You only care
about yourself.

01:00:40.721 --> 01:00:42.638
You hated my cartoon.

01:00:43.724 --> 01:00:47.393
You made fun of my clothes.
You disrespected Joshie.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:51.063
You broke my hand
and you didn't even
seem sorry.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.858
That broken hand
was the best thing
that ever happened to you !

01:00:55.610 --> 01:00:57.236
Don't call me.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:01.282
Don't come by my house.
We're done.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:21.469
l thought the whole thing
wouId bIow over.

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:24.555
But Rowley was still giving me
the siIent treatment.

01:01:24.639 --> 01:01:26.682
Even when I tried to
make the first move.

01:01:26.767 --> 01:01:27.850
Yeah.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:35.983
So, anyway, l was
so angry at him,
l didn't know what to say.

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:38.194
One of the kindergarteners

01:01:38.278 --> 01:01:41.113
finally told their parents
the whole story.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:47.119
Greg? You're relieved
of your Safety Patrol duties,
effective immediately.

01:01:48.330 --> 01:01:49.705
Rowley,

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:54.877
for showing dignity
under false suspicion,
l am promoting you

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:56.879
to team captain.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:03.552
Now, that's a position
that l held for two years.
l know you'll honor it.

01:02:24.658 --> 01:02:25.866
Okay

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:30.496
You're supposed to
be my friend

01:02:31.623 --> 01:02:33.833
We're supposed to get along

01:02:35.085 --> 01:02:38.129
Hey, you're supposed to
be my friend

01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:42.842
Hey, Rowley, my mom says
it's okay for me
to sleep over tonight.

01:02:42.926 --> 01:02:44.260
Awesome!

01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:49.432
The whole thing
with Rowley is, l was willing
to let bygones be bygones.

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.059
But then he made friends
with CoIIin
just to mess with me.

01:02:52.144 --> 01:02:53.686
As if I even care if he...

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:58.858
Well, you know what?

01:02:59.192 --> 01:03:00.860
Two can play at that game.

01:03:01.736 --> 01:03:03.612
There's no
going back, Sergeant.

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:05.573
l need to board
the helicopter.

01:03:05.657 --> 01:03:07.533
Do you have my back?

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.994
l will always
have your back, Captain.

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:12.955
Yeah, maybe l'll meet up
with some friends

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:16.667
Yeah, maybe l'll meet up
with some dogs

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:19.879
'Cause you're supposed to be

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.338
You're supposed to be

01:03:21.423 --> 01:03:23.757
Supposed to be my friend

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:27.052
You're supposed to
be my friend now

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:32.016
Hey.

01:03:32.434 --> 01:03:33.893
Hey, Greg Heffley.

01:03:36.104 --> 01:03:40.357
So, l was thinking
maybe you might
want to have a sleepover?

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:43.569
Yeah. With who?

01:03:44.696 --> 01:03:45.905
Me.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:47.573
Yeah, when?

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:49.909
Now.

01:03:51.077 --> 01:03:53.120
Greg Heffley,
l love you !

01:03:53.205 --> 01:03:55.331
We are going to be
best friends forever!

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:59.251
Wanna have
a tickle fight?

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:05.925
Okay.
Let's get inside.

01:04:08.595 --> 01:04:10.346
l can't believe it!

01:04:10.639 --> 01:04:14.725
Greg Heffley's in my room !
Greg Heffley's
in my room, Rebecca.

01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:17.937
What do you want to do,
Greg Heffley?
How about Twister?

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.898
l'm not really
that much of a Twister guy.

01:04:21.858 --> 01:04:23.108
Candy!
Wait!

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:25.569
No, no, no!
Fregley, come on ! Really!

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.571
l really think
we should save those
for later!

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:29.156
Maybe we should
go outside and. . .

01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:30.783
My mom doesn't
let me have sugar.

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:34.495
She says high glucose
in my diet
induces hyperactivity.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:37.748
But it's so good !

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.875
Greg Heffley, you want
to jumpety-jump?

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.710
Yeah, you know
what, Fregley?
l just remembered,

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.255
l have an appointment,
a really important
appointment.

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:48.300
lt's a homework appointment.
Yeah, and l really
should be going.

01:04:51.513 --> 01:04:52.846
Get away from me!

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:58.352
l can fly! Whoa.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:00.604
How fun,
Greg Heffley!

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:05.526
Greg? Greg, Greg,
Greg, Greg, Greg?
Greg? Greg?

01:05:07.153 --> 01:05:09.780
l hear you breathing,
Greg Heffley.

01:05:36.433 --> 01:05:38.017
Dear Gregory

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:41.687
l'm very sorry l chased you
with a booger on my finger.

01:05:42.188 --> 01:05:45.482
Here, l put it on this paper
so you can get me back.

01:05:59.205 --> 01:06:00.372
What?

01:06:04.836 --> 01:06:06.170
All right.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:11.800
Okay, enough.
l'll show Rowley
I don't need him.

01:06:11.885 --> 01:06:14.637
When he sees me
in the yearbook
as Most TaIented,

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.722
he's gonna come running back.

01:06:18.933 --> 01:06:22.853
Okay, since there are
so many of you
here auditioning,

01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:27.733
to save time,
we're gonna do a group sing
of one of my favorite songs.

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:30.527
Please refer to the lyrics
on this handout.

01:06:30.612 --> 01:06:34.239
l will pick out
the best voices
and place you accordingly.

01:07:36.803 --> 01:07:42.015
Greg Heffley, what a lovely
soprano voice you have.
l'm stunned !

01:07:42.976 --> 01:07:44.852
Maybe you should be Dorothy!

01:07:48.815 --> 01:07:50.774
No, no, l can't be. . .
No!

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:54.486
Greg Heffley was suspended
from the school
Safety Patrol !

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:58.157
How can you trust him
with the lead role
in the play?

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.451
He can't be Dorothy!
l'm Dorothy!

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:01.660
All right, Patty,
calm down.

01:08:01.745 --> 01:08:03.787
l'm Dorothy! l am !

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:07.374
My mother
is the president
of the P.T.A.

01:08:07.459 --> 01:08:09.668
She can ruin your life!

01:08:10.378 --> 01:08:11.920
Just an idea.

01:08:13.173 --> 01:08:17.593
All right, well, Greg,
your voice is too high for
any of the other male roles.

01:08:17.677 --> 01:08:19.678
Perhaps you can be a tree!

01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:21.180
A tree?

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:23.432
No way.

01:08:29.856 --> 01:08:32.983
The trees
get to throw apples
at Patty Farrell.

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.819
Haven't you
seen the movie?

01:08:45.914 --> 01:08:48.207
Wait, we don't
get arm holes?

01:08:48.291 --> 01:08:50.626
How are we gonna throw apples
at Dorothy without arm holes?

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.796
You don't need arm holes
because nobody's
throwing any apples.

01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.674
We're not doing the movie.
ln my version,
the trees sing.

01:08:57.842 --> 01:08:59.551
These, my dear.

01:08:59.719 --> 01:09:03.388
Down the winding yellow road

01:09:03.765 --> 01:09:07.810
Doth she know
to where it goes

01:09:07.894 --> 01:09:11.480
With her dog
so smaII and true

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:14.149
We hope she fares well

01:09:14.234 --> 01:09:18.403
Yes, we do

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:27.204
My tooth !
l think l knocked out
my tooth !

01:09:27.288 --> 01:09:29.790
Perhaps we should
cut out some arm holes.

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.583
ls he okay?
You think?

01:09:45.181 --> 01:09:48.684
lsn't this exciting?
Your son's in a play.

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:52.437
Yeah, sure.
lt's not wrestling,
but. . .

01:09:55.316 --> 01:09:57.150
But at least it's something.
Come on, Toto.

01:09:57.235 --> 01:10:01.113
Let us explore
this magical path !

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:09.538
Bubby!

01:10:10.874 --> 01:10:13.333
Bubby! Bubby!

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:14.960
Bubby.

01:10:17.755 --> 01:10:20.966
Hey, Bubby, l think
you dropped an apple.

01:10:21.092 --> 01:10:22.092
Huh?

01:10:25.555 --> 01:10:29.224
We three trees
from yonder glen

01:10:29.309 --> 01:10:33.896
Do spy a fair
and sweet maiden

01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:37.524
WhiIst we're rooted
to our spots

01:10:37.609 --> 01:10:42.154
ln silver slippers
she doth trot

01:10:42.322 --> 01:10:45.908
Down the winding yellow road

01:10:45.992 --> 01:10:46.950
Oh, yes.

01:10:47.035 --> 01:10:50.329
Doth she know
to where it goes

01:10:50.413 --> 01:10:51.538
You're dead.

01:10:51.623 --> 01:10:54.249
With her dog
so smaII and true

01:10:54.334 --> 01:10:56.627
We hope she fares well

01:10:56.711 --> 01:11:00.797
Yes, we do

01:11:00.882 --> 01:11:03.508
We three trees from...

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:10.807
From yonder glen !

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:14.353
Wish her joy
through journey's end !

01:11:17.607 --> 01:11:24.279
Sing !

01:11:24.364 --> 01:11:25.656
This bites!

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.950
Come on,
Greg Heffley!

01:11:28.034 --> 01:11:31.453
Stop ruining the play
like you ruin
everything else!

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:36.291
Don't make me
come over there
and beat you up again !

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:53.600
Eat this!

01:11:57.981 --> 01:11:58.981
Wow.

01:12:13.871 --> 01:12:15.831
What'd you think?
l thought he was
the best one up there.

01:12:15.915 --> 01:12:17.374
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.

01:12:17.458 --> 01:12:18.709
You know, l'm. . .

01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:27.759
l thought
Dorothy deserved it.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:31.138
Thanks, Dad.

01:12:32.265 --> 01:12:34.725
You got some
good shots in there.

01:12:41.524 --> 01:12:43.775
Look what l found
in the trash.

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.527
Guess you threw it
away by accident.

01:12:46.154 --> 01:12:47.362
Give it back, Rodrick!

01:12:47.447 --> 01:12:49.322
No way!
You want it?

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:51.283
Come and get it then !
Come on.

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:53.035
Give it!
Come on !

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:55.370
Use your muscular legs!
No, you can't have it.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:56.955
Okay, okay, boys!
Give it back!

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.290
Hold on, don't you want it?
Okay!

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.791
lt's for you.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:04.755
lt's an invitation
for the Mother and Son
Sweetheart Dance.

01:13:05.965 --> 01:13:07.924
l knew you didn't want
to miss that.

01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:09.468
lt looks like a lot of fun.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:12.554
l think you should go.
l think
it'd be a lot of fun.

01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:15.849
Fun?
That's the exact opposite
of fun!

01:13:17.018 --> 01:13:20.812
This entire year
has been terribIe
and nobody even cares!

01:13:20.938 --> 01:13:23.315
My family, my best friend.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:27.194
WeII, I'm sick of it.
Somebody needs to pay.

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:36.411
Okay, Manny, l'm putting
this Tootsie Roll
in Rodrick's backpack.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:41.833
lt's for Rodrick,
so whatever you do,
don't touch the Tootsie Roll.

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.002
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:50.300
Greg? Coaster.
Where's he. . .

01:13:52.512 --> 01:13:55.680
Manny?
Where did you get that?

01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:05.023
Oh, my.
That's offensive.

01:14:13.825 --> 01:14:16.118
Rodrick? Rodrick!

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:20.038
l need to talk to you
inside! Now!

01:14:20.706 --> 01:14:24.126
Go ahead and talk.
We're a band
and we have no secrets.

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:25.502
Okay, fine.

01:14:25.586 --> 01:14:27.045
What is this?

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:30.841
lt's not mine.

01:14:30.925 --> 01:14:32.300
lt was in your backpack.

01:14:32.385 --> 01:14:34.553
No, it was in my room.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:40.433
Does owning this magazine
make you a better person?

01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:42.519
No.

01:14:42.603 --> 01:14:44.396
Did it make you
more popular at school?

01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:45.730
Yes!

01:14:46.482 --> 01:14:47.774
No.

01:14:47.859 --> 01:14:52.654
How do you feel
about having owned
this type of magazine?

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:56.116
Ashamed !
Nice.

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:57.200
Hmm.

01:14:59.579 --> 01:15:03.165
Do you have anything
you wanna say to women

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:07.127
for having owned
this offensive magazine?

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:10.088
l'm sorry, women.

01:15:10.256 --> 01:15:11.298
Yeah, women.

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:12.924
Yeah.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:18.763
You're grounded
for two weeks.

01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:22.184
Okay, settle down, Susan !
l think one week is plenty!

01:15:22.268 --> 01:15:25.979
Make it four weeks
and l'm gonna need
the keys to your van !

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:27.606
My van?

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:31.276
Yeah ! Yeah.

01:15:33.112 --> 01:15:34.279
Yeah.

01:15:36.449 --> 01:15:37.782
Hello?

01:15:39.035 --> 01:15:40.285
HeIIo?

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:55.550
All right, smile.

01:15:55.885 --> 01:15:58.845
Look at this place!
Wanna dance?

01:15:59.513 --> 01:16:02.057
Mom, stop dancing.
You're embarrassing me.

01:16:02.141 --> 01:16:05.310
Come on.
l'm just keeping time
to the music.

01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:07.938
l'm begging you,
please stop it.

01:16:08.022 --> 01:16:09.981
Okay, okay, okay.

01:16:12.068 --> 01:16:13.276
Thanks, honey.

01:16:14.487 --> 01:16:15.737
Hi !

01:16:15.821 --> 01:16:18.198
Well, if we're
not here to dance,

01:16:18.282 --> 01:16:20.700
maybe you should
go talk to Rowley.

01:16:21.035 --> 01:16:23.578
l think it's time
you two made up.

01:16:24.163 --> 01:16:25.413
l can't.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:30.126
Sweetheart,
he's your best friend.

01:16:31.128 --> 01:16:34.631
And sometimes,
when somebody's worth it,

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:37.175
you just have to
put yourself out there.

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:41.930
l wouldn't know
what to say.

01:16:42.348 --> 01:16:45.558
Well, l could go
for an ice cream
after the dance.

01:16:45.643 --> 01:16:48.228
Maybe you could
invite him to join us.

01:16:48.396 --> 01:16:49.479
Yeah.

01:16:55.778 --> 01:16:57.195
Hey, Rowley.

01:16:59.156 --> 01:17:00.282
Hey.

01:17:00.616 --> 01:17:04.286
So you want to go
get some ice cream after?

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.539
l'm sorry.
We already have plans.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.710
Yeah. We do.

01:17:13.546 --> 01:17:18.174
Oh, fine.
My mom wanted me to ask.
So l did.

01:17:18.592 --> 01:17:20.719
l didn't even want to go.

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:30.895
Well?

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:36.484
Honey, l'm sorry.

01:17:41.365 --> 01:17:42.574
Yeah !

01:17:54.337 --> 01:17:57.714
Well, now,
don't you tell me to smile

01:17:57.798 --> 01:17:59.674
You stick around
l'll make it worth your while

01:17:59.759 --> 01:18:02.260
Got numbers
beyond what you can dial

01:18:02.345 --> 01:18:04.512
Maybe it's because
I'm so versatiIe

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:06.806
StyIe profiIe, I said

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:09.059
lt always brings me back
when I hear, Ooh, ChiId

01:18:09.143 --> 01:18:11.269
From the Hudson River
out to the NiIe

01:18:11.354 --> 01:18:13.480
I run the marathon
till the very last mile

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:15.899
lf you battle me
I wiII reviIe

01:18:15.983 --> 01:18:18.068
People always say
my style is wild

01:18:18.152 --> 01:18:20.403
You've got gall,
you've got guile

01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:22.697
To step to me,
l'm a rapophile

01:18:22.782 --> 01:18:24.866
lf you want to battle,
you're in denial

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:27.160
Coming from Uranus
to check my style

01:18:27.244 --> 01:18:29.412
Go ahead,
put my rhymes on trial

01:18:29.497 --> 01:18:31.748
Cast you off into exiIe

01:18:43.094 --> 01:18:45.345
You have
got to be kidding me.

01:18:58.818 --> 01:19:00.985
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

01:19:10.663 --> 01:19:14.249
Hey.

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:17.919
So, l left
my racing game
at your house

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:20.130
and Collin's
sleeping over tonight.

01:19:20.214 --> 01:19:21.840
So l need it back.

01:19:22.675 --> 01:19:24.926
What? No way.

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:26.553
Finders, keepers.

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:28.930
You didn't find it,
l left it.

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:33.059
Fine, then leavers, losers.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:36.271
That's not even
a real thing.

01:19:36.355 --> 01:19:37.814
lt is if l say it is.

01:19:37.898 --> 01:19:39.441
lt's my game.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:40.692
Do you know what?

01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:43.736
You wouldn't even
have that game
if l hadn't told you about it.

01:19:43.821 --> 01:19:45.738
You wouldn't have
half the stuff
you have without me.

01:19:45.823 --> 01:19:48.241
Yeah, like
a broken hand !

01:19:49.869 --> 01:19:51.703
That was
a million years ago.

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:53.455
lt clicks now!

01:19:54.039 --> 01:19:56.708
Hear that?
Click, click,
click, click.

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:58.585
And it's all
your fault!

01:19:58.669 --> 01:20:00.003
lt was an accident!

01:20:00.087 --> 01:20:02.922
Kick his butt,
Rowley! lt's easy.

01:20:03.090 --> 01:20:05.300
Guys, Greg and Rowley
are gonna fight.

01:20:05.384 --> 01:20:17.228
Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight!

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:31.493
Come on,
what's wrong with you guys?
Start punching !

01:20:33.746 --> 01:20:34.787
You start.

01:20:34.872 --> 01:20:35.997
You start it.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.499
No, you !

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:40.585
Quit copying me!

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:44.756
This has got to be
the worst fight ever!
Do something !

01:20:55.935 --> 01:21:00.188
Well, well, well.
Look who we have here.

01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:03.107
You're so
freaking dead.

01:21:03.317 --> 01:21:06.027
All you guys better scram
or l'm gonna
kick your butts, too!

01:21:08.030 --> 01:21:09.656
Not you two.

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:17.622
You guys have no idea
what l'm gonna do to you.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:18.790
Oh, um. . .

01:21:20.793 --> 01:21:22.544
What are we gonna do?

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.338
l don't know.
We need to move this along.

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:28.216
My shift at Cinnabon
starts in half an hour.

01:21:44.567 --> 01:21:47.735
l know what we're gonna do.
Give me the wide one.

01:21:47.945 --> 01:21:49.988
That's you,
let's go.

01:21:51.991 --> 01:21:53.449
Pick it up.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:55.159
But. . .
Pick it up.

01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:12.135
Now eat it.

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:13.886
No!

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:17.307
Eat it or l'll shove
the entire thing
down your throat.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:32.780
l don't even want to say
exactly what happened

01:22:32.865 --> 01:22:36.367
because if Rowley ever tries
to run for President

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:39.454
and someone finds out
what these guys made him do,

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:41.456
he won't have a chance.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:42.874
Now you.

01:22:43.042 --> 01:22:45.001
But l'm allergic
to dairy!

01:22:45.085 --> 01:22:47.670
l'll die, and then
you'll go to jail ! And. . .

01:22:47.755 --> 01:22:49.213
Hey!

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:50.548
What are you doing
on school property?

01:22:50.633 --> 01:22:51.716
Go, go, go!

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:52.967
Shotgun !

01:22:53.052 --> 01:22:55.219
Pete Hosey,
is that you?

01:23:00.017 --> 01:23:01.517
You boys okay?

01:23:02.645 --> 01:23:04.228
Yeah? All right.

01:23:08.067 --> 01:23:11.235
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:22.747
Oh, my God.

01:23:24.166 --> 01:23:25.750
Rowley Jefferson ate. . .

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:27.585
l ate the cheese!

01:23:44.937 --> 01:23:47.230
Yeah. l ate it.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:50.024
And you know
what, people?

01:23:50.609 --> 01:23:52.902
l just did
you all a huge favor.

01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:58.950
l ate the cheese
to show you all how stupid
this whole school is.

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:01.869
The wrong friends.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.373
The wrong lunch table.

01:24:06.291 --> 01:24:07.959
The wrong butt?

01:24:09.378 --> 01:24:11.504
lt's all meaningless.

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.298
Just like this cheese.

01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:18.177
l know it.
You all know it.

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:20.221
So come on.

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:24.559
Everyone else
who's sick of it,
step forward and join me!

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:30.565
Cheese Touch !
Greg Heffley
has the Cheese Touch !

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:31.816
Run !

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.152
He's got
the Cheese Touch !

01:24:43.203 --> 01:24:46.789
Not bad, Heffley.
Not bad at all.

01:24:59.344 --> 01:25:02.764
So you want to
come over
after school and

01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:05.349
play?

01:25:09.229 --> 01:25:10.438
Yeah.

01:25:13.901 --> 01:25:15.109
Okay.

01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:33.169
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.

01:25:33.253 --> 01:25:34.962
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:36.172
Thanks!

01:25:36.632 --> 01:25:38.424
Here's your yearbook.
Have a great summer.

01:25:38.509 --> 01:25:39.926
Thanks, Patty.

01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:43.638
Here's your yearbook.
You're not in it that much.

01:25:43.722 --> 01:25:46.390
Maybe try to get out there
a little next year.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.434
You know what, Patty?

01:25:48.519 --> 01:25:51.687
One day middle school will end
and become high school.

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:54.315
And after that,
it just becomes life.

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:59.320
And all those things
you think are important now
won't be anymore.

01:25:59.905 --> 01:26:01.906
You wish.

01:26:03.742 --> 01:26:05.201
As if!

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:10.039
Handing it to you
is like touching you

01:26:10.123 --> 01:26:13.876
and l am way too smart
to touch somebody
who ate the cheese.

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:18.130
Rowley!
Have a great summer!

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.882
Stay cool.

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:24.053
Yep, you're way too smart
for me, Patty Farrell.

01:26:28.559 --> 01:26:30.852
So the year
turned out pretty good.

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:34.063
My goal was to be
a class favorite,
and l made it.

01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:38.401
Even if it wasn't exactly
the way l planned it.

01:26:39.278 --> 01:26:41.654
Zoo-wee Mama!

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:48.786
Hey! Oh!

01:26:55.294 --> 01:26:57.545
I don't wanna
waste my time again

01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:59.797
By getting wasted
with so-caIIed friends

01:26:59.882 --> 01:27:01.132
'Cause they don't know me

01:27:01.216 --> 01:27:04.510
But they pretend to be
part of my social scenery

01:27:04.595 --> 01:27:06.345
Hey, maybe l'm a critic,
a cynic

01:27:06.430 --> 01:27:09.223
Or am I jaded
or am I afraid of it?

01:27:09.308 --> 01:27:10.600
'Cause It's dragging me down

01:27:10.684 --> 01:27:11.767
lt's bumming me out

01:27:11.852 --> 01:27:15.855
lt's making my head spin
round and round

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:17.523
Can you say, "Hey?"

01:27:17.608 --> 01:27:18.733
Can you say, "Oh?"

01:27:18.817 --> 01:27:21.110
That's right,
what do you want from me?

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:22.361
Can you say, "Hey?"

01:27:22.446 --> 01:27:23.446
Can you say, "Oh?"

01:27:23.530 --> 01:27:25.948
That's right,
what do you want from me?

01:27:26.033 --> 01:27:28.034
l get the feeling
we're on to something

01:27:28.118 --> 01:27:30.411
l say jump
and you start jumping

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:31.787
Can you say, "Hey?"

01:27:31.872 --> 01:27:33.039
Can you say, "Oh?"

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:35.666
That's right,
what do you want from me?

01:27:35.751 --> 01:27:37.960
Just another day
in the Iife of me

01:27:38.045 --> 01:27:40.254
It's 3:00 am,
and l can't sleep

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:41.964
Maybe l'm a critic, a cynic

01:27:42.049 --> 01:27:44.842
Or am I crazy?
Do they all hate me?

01:27:44.927 --> 01:27:47.261
'Cause they pick me up
and throw me down

01:27:47.346 --> 01:27:51.849
lt's making my head spin
round and round

01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:55.478
Can you say, "Hey?"

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:56.687
Can you say, "Oh?"

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:59.065
