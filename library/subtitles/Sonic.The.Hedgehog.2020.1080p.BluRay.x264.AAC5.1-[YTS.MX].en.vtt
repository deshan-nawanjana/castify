00:01:22.461 --> 00:01:24.224
<i>So... I know what you're thinking.</i>

3
00:01:24.383 --> 00:01:26.562
<i>Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog</i>

4
00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:29.926
<i>being chased by a mad man
with a mustache from the civil war?</i>

5
00:01:30.414 --> 00:01:33.918
<i>Gotta be honest, it feels like
I've been running my whole life.</i>

6
00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:36.591
<i>Is this too much? Am I going too fast?</i>

7
00:01:36.757 --> 00:01:39.790
<i>It's kinda what I do.
You know what? Let's back up.</i>

8
00:01:47.661 --> 00:01:50.239
<i>This is the island where I am from.</i>

9
00:01:51.135 --> 00:01:54.894
<i>It had everything: sandy beaches,
cascading waterfalls,</i>

10
00:01:55.117 --> 00:01:57.006
<i>public access to loop-de-loops.</i>

11
00:01:57.198 --> 00:01:58.995
<i>And I never had to catch a school bus</i>

12
00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:03.009
<i>because I can run across the entire island
in less than two seconds.</i>

13
00:02:03.193 --> 00:02:04.972
<i>Also, there was no school.</i>

14
00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:07.601
<i>I know, pretty sweet island, right?</i>

15
00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.950
<i>I was born with extraordinary powers,
and was told to keep them in secret.</i>

16
00:02:13.101 --> 00:02:16.199
<i>And like any kid, I did the exact opposite.</i>

17
00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.931
<i>That's Longclaw, she took care of me.</i>

18
00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:25.329
<i>She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi,
if Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice.</i>

19
00:02:25.834 --> 00:02:28.019
Sonic, someone could've seen you!

20
00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.994
No one saw me. I am too fast!

21
00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.537
And, I wanted to bring you this.

22
00:02:36.942 --> 00:02:38.474
Get down!

23
00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:45.558
<i>Turns out with great power
comes great power-hungry bad guys.</i>

24
00:02:45.768 --> 00:02:48.072
<i>And I let them right to us.</i>

25
00:03:02.296 --> 00:03:04.250
Listen carefully, Sonic.

26
00:03:04.832 --> 00:03:07.824
You have a power unlike anything
I've ever seen.

27
00:03:07.961 --> 00:03:10.511
And that means someone
will always want it.

28
00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:14.713
The only way to stay safe
is to stay hidden.

29
00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:21.708
This word is on the farthest side
of the universe. You should be safe there.

30
00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.525
-I don't wanna go without you!
-You must!

31
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:27.741
These rings will be your most important
possession.

32
00:03:31.302 --> 00:03:33.799
If you ever discovered, use one.

33
00:03:34.187 --> 00:03:37.845
Never stop running. Now go!

34
00:03:42.076 --> 00:03:44.044
Longclaw!

35
00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:47.189
-Goodbye, Sonic.
-No!

36
00:03:48.857 --> 00:03:50.575
No!

37
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.613
C'mon, one car?

38
00:04:28.828 --> 00:04:29.987
I'm bored.

39
00:04:30.023 --> 00:04:31.798
Tom, do you read me?
Are you there?

40
00:04:32.048 --> 00:04:35.469
No, Wade, I'm actually on a yacht
in Barbados

41
00:04:36.123 --> 00:04:37.548
with Rihanna.

42
00:04:37.678 --> 00:04:40.760
OMG. That's amazing, please send pics.

43
00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:42.894
No, Wade, I'm at the speed trap.

44
00:04:43.068 --> 00:04:46.553
Already? How did you get back so fast?
Barbados is in the ocean.

45
00:04:46.697 --> 00:04:48.842
Hang on, I think I got something.

46
00:04:55.213 --> 00:04:57.961
Hey, buddy, where's the fire?

47
00:04:58.293 --> 00:05:00.453
We've got kids living around here.

48
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.861
It was kinda funny, sorry.

49
00:05:09.748 --> 00:05:11.362
What?

50
00:05:50.355 --> 00:05:54.401
<i>Tom, we need you down on Main Street.
There's been a violent gang shoot-out.</i>

51
00:05:56.187 --> 00:06:00.675
<i>Just kidding, a dog stole a bagel.
But they do need it back.</i>

52
00:06:12.218 --> 00:06:14.659
Buddy, you almost got yourself killed
out there.

53
00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:16.790
What are you, some kind
of an adrenaline junkie?

54
00:06:16.913 --> 00:06:19.012
Must be rough being slow all the time.

55
00:06:19.062 --> 00:06:22.689
I'll tell you what,
today is your lucky day.

56
00:06:26.726 --> 00:06:29.195
Have you ever felt so alive?

57
00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:32.761
This is great, you're doing amazing.

58
00:06:33.209 --> 00:06:34.619
Oh, jeez!

59
00:06:35.041 --> 00:06:37.455
Good recovery!

60
00:06:39.928 --> 00:06:42.158
Let's keep this our little secret, okay?

61
00:06:42.302 --> 00:06:45.360
You never saw me.
I was never here.

62
00:06:59.926 --> 00:07:01.668
<i>So, what were you expecting?</i>

63
00:07:01.826 --> 00:07:05.384
<i>A dirty little hedgehog eating berries,
and struggling to survive?</i>

64
00:07:05.593 --> 00:07:10.049
<i>Think again, because I am living
my best life on Earth.</i>

65
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:11.813
<i>I've got a library.</i>

66
00:07:13.514 --> 00:07:14.988
<i>A home gym.</i>

67
00:07:15.137 --> 00:07:17.560
<i>And a state of the art security system.</i>

68
00:07:30.186 --> 00:07:31.957
Oh, no!

69
00:07:32.426 --> 00:07:35.528
<i>And if I ever discovered,
I'll follow Longclaw's instructions,</i>

70
00:07:35.677 --> 00:07:38.238
<i>and use my rings
to escape to a new planet.</i>

71
00:07:38.726 --> 00:07:42.276
<i>A nice, safe little world
filled only with mushrooms.</i>

72
00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.955
<i>Gross, smelly mushrooms...</i>

73
00:07:48.106 --> 00:07:49.691
I hate mushrooms.

74
00:07:51.052 --> 00:07:52.966
<i>But let's not worry about all of that.</i>

75
00:07:53.204 --> 00:07:55.674
<i>This is Green Hills.</i>

76
00:07:55.861 --> 00:07:58.079
<i>The greatest place on Earth.</i>

77
00:07:59.156 --> 00:08:03.985
<i>These are my people, and there, I say,
I am their lovable space creature.</i>

78
00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:06.589
<i>So what if they don't know I exist?</i>

79
00:08:07.815 --> 00:08:10.908
<i>My favorite person is the Donut Lord.</i>

80
00:08:12.004 --> 00:08:13.843
<i>Protector of this town,</i>

81
00:08:14.223 --> 00:08:17.384
<i>and defender of all creatures,
big and small.</i>

82
00:08:17.564 --> 00:08:20.141
Morning, Donald, Daisy, Daffy.

83
00:08:21.332 --> 00:08:23.773
<i>Donut Lord lives with Pretzel Lady.</i>

84
00:08:24.558 --> 00:08:28.995
<i>She is super nice to animals,
and strangely was born without bones.</i>

85
00:08:31.805 --> 00:08:34.850
<i>There is one person in town
who's actually onto me.</i>

86
00:08:35.055 --> 00:08:37.072
<i>He calls me The Blue Devil.</i>

87
00:08:37.262 --> 00:08:40.679
-I almost caught him last night.
-<i>Say hello to Crazy Carl.</i>

88
00:08:44.359 --> 00:08:46.539
<i>We have fun together.</i>

89
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.204
I know you're out there!

90
00:08:50.412 --> 00:08:53.008
And I know you're real!

91
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:55.370
No, I'm not.

92
00:08:56.057 --> 00:08:58.308
<i>Movie night is my favorite.</i>

93
00:08:58.447 --> 00:09:00.072
Please, please...

94
00:09:00.467 --> 00:09:03.565
Yes! Keanu, you are a national treasure.

95
00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:06.085
<i>-When I find you--
-Pop quiz hot-shot.</i>

96
00:09:06.258 --> 00:09:07.765
<i>There's a bomb on the bus.</i>

97
00:09:07.939 --> 00:09:11.146
Pop quiz hot-shot.
The classic line.

98
00:09:11.839 --> 00:09:14.121
<i>Basically, we're like a family,</i>

99
00:09:14.376 --> 00:09:16.221
<i>even though we haven't met yet.</i>

100
00:09:16.283 --> 00:09:21.179
You don't think your prolonged isolation
is making you a bit crazy perhaps?

101
00:09:21.356 --> 00:09:25.797
Crazy? Me? No way, Doc.
You got me all wrong.

102
00:09:26.009 --> 00:09:28.909
And despite all these
so called friends of yours,

103
00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:32.117
deep down you are still rather lonely?

104
00:09:37.782 --> 00:09:41.098
<i>Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever?</i>

105
00:09:56.663 --> 00:09:58.744
Hey! No, no...

106
00:09:59.414 --> 00:10:03.070
Get out of there! Come on!
Oh, come on! Get out of there!

107
00:10:03.497 --> 00:10:05.873
Get out of there, you trash pandas!

108
00:10:07.441 --> 00:10:10.119
Maddie, as Green Hills
most respected veterinary,

109
00:10:10.293 --> 00:10:13.070
what is the fastest way
to exterminate a racoon?

110
00:10:13.465 --> 00:10:16.056
Hi, Ozzy. Hello.
You're glad to see me?

111
00:10:16.156 --> 00:10:17.752
You don't eat garbage, do you?

112
00:10:18.124 --> 00:10:19.651
What's that?

113
00:10:20.016 --> 00:10:22.503
-Is that what I think it is?
-Open it.

114
00:10:23.909 --> 00:10:27.386
-It's kinda small, is that bad?
-Just... open it.

115
00:10:33.195 --> 00:10:35.279
Dear Thomas, we have reviewed
your application

116
00:10:35.398 --> 00:10:37.098
to the San Francisco Police Department,

117
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:39.827
and pending inter departmental review
and background check.

118
00:10:39.923 --> 00:10:43.848
And we are happy to inform you that you
have been selected to join our team.

119
00:10:44.008 --> 00:10:46.116
Wow! Oh my God!

120
00:10:48.987 --> 00:10:50.682
San Francisco sucks?

121
00:10:52.952 --> 00:10:54.475
Wrong one.

122
00:10:59.082 --> 00:11:01.211
-You never had a doubt, huh?
-No!

123
00:11:04.242 --> 00:11:07.280
-I can't believe this!
-I know. You did it!

124
00:11:09.014 --> 00:11:10.646
What are those?

125
00:11:11.673 --> 00:11:14.059
Apartments for rent I found on Zillow.

126
00:11:14.243 --> 00:11:16.911
I though Ozzy and I
can fly there tomorrow,

127
00:11:17.078 --> 00:11:19.384
and check out some neighborhoods.

128
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:22.144
I mean, this is all happening so fast.

129
00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:28.149
Man, it's the craziest thing,
you apply for the job, you get the job.

130
00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.409
-Well, pending a background check.
-Oh, man,

131
00:11:30.536 --> 00:11:34.212
hope they don't find out about that time
you used the neighbor's WiFi.

132
00:11:34.381 --> 00:11:36.850
Correction, I'm still using
the neighbor's WiFi.

133
00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.541
But, Maddie...

134
00:11:38.852 --> 00:11:40.548
Are you sure you're okay with this?

135
00:11:40.727 --> 00:11:42.285
Thomas Michael Wachowski,

136
00:11:42.401 --> 00:11:44.920
what did you do the entire time
I was in a veterinary school?

137
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:47.040
I worked the second job
to pay the rent, and--

138
00:11:47.153 --> 00:11:49.057
A third job to pay tuition.

139
00:11:49.215 --> 00:11:53.258
You sacrificed for me,
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

140
00:11:54.185 --> 00:11:57.093
Babe, are you sure you're okay with this?

141
00:11:57.869 --> 00:12:02.119
I mean, there's been a Wachowski
protecting this town for more than 50 years.

142
00:12:03.128 --> 00:12:05.125
This is a big change.

143
00:12:05.636 --> 00:12:07.255
I'm positive.

144
00:12:08.186 --> 00:12:10.594
It's time for this guy to get out there
and prove himself.

145
00:12:10.725 --> 00:12:12.582
I love Green Hills, but...

146
00:12:12.727 --> 00:12:15.028
You know, I wanna help people
in real trouble.

147
00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:18.148
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-or-death situation,

148
00:12:18.306 --> 00:12:19.868
and I'll be there for them.

149
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.632
-I get it. I'm so proud of you.
-Thank you.

150
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:28.524
And so it is with a heavy heart,
that I tell you all

151
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:31.753
that I've accepted a position
at the San Francisco Police Department

152
00:12:31.941 --> 00:12:33.469
effective immediately.

153
00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:36.966
It's gonna be tough to leave my home town,
and all my friendships.

154
00:12:37.517 --> 00:12:40.311
But this is something
I feel like I need to do,

155
00:12:41.305 --> 00:12:45.633
to grow, as both an officer, and a man.

156
00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:50.952
What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles?

157
00:12:51.786 --> 00:12:53.479
That wasn't so bad, right?

158
00:12:54.897 --> 00:12:56.623
Now all I gotta do is...

159
00:12:57.413 --> 00:12:59.231
tell everyone who isn't a donut.

160
00:13:01.361 --> 00:13:03.770
Whoa, the play-offs.

161
00:13:48.322 --> 00:13:50.218
So cool.

162
00:13:54.475 --> 00:13:55.887
We're at the ninth, tie score.

163
00:13:56.035 --> 00:13:59.644
And exactly who you want at the plate
with a game on the line, Sonic.

164
00:13:59.779 --> 00:14:01.713
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

165
00:14:01.868 --> 00:14:06.135
is the most fearsome southpaw
in Green Hills, also Sonic.

166
00:14:06.375 --> 00:14:07.660
Okay, focus, Sonic.

167
00:14:07.815 --> 00:14:11.405
If you win this game you'll be
the most beloved kid in Green Hills.

168
00:14:15.267 --> 00:14:18.945
Hit it to the guy in left,
he's a real space case.

169
00:14:22.204 --> 00:14:23.816
I can't with that guy.

170
00:14:24.005 --> 00:14:28.118
Hey, batter Sonic, hey, batter Sonic,
is so in batter Sonic.

171
00:14:35.509 --> 00:14:36.994
I got it, I got it...

172
00:14:38.161 --> 00:14:39.677
I don't got it.

173
00:14:48.299 --> 00:14:50.317
Go home! Go home!

174
00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:52.329
Come on!

175
00:14:57.339 --> 00:14:58.752
Safe!

176
00:15:00.733 --> 00:15:03.214
Yes! Yes! I did it!

177
00:15:03.355 --> 00:15:06.060
Did you see that? I did it! I did it.

178
00:15:19.262 --> 00:15:21.285
I really am alone.

179
00:15:21.843 --> 00:15:24.444
All alone. Forever.

180
00:15:58.688 --> 00:16:01.739
I'm sure no one noticed
that giant blue explosion, right?

181
00:16:12.484 --> 00:16:14.817
-Hey, Wade.
-Hi, Tom. Wade here.

182
00:16:15.864 --> 00:16:17.537
What is going on?

183
00:16:17.677 --> 00:16:20.065
-Oh Gosh, I think the power is out.
-Yap, dur.

184
00:16:20.193 --> 00:16:22.712
The lights are out.
The whole town is freaking out.

185
00:16:23.112 --> 00:16:24.805
-What should I do?
-Okay. Relax.

186
00:16:24.931 --> 00:16:26.769
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

187
00:16:26.895 --> 00:16:29.383
see if they can locate
the down line, then...

188
00:16:29.874 --> 00:16:32.676
call Zim, and see if he can get
his generator over to the Super Cue

189
00:16:32.815 --> 00:16:37.698
-so the food stays fresh.
-Call Zim before Gil?

190
00:16:38.246 --> 00:16:40.659
-Call Gil-- Hello? Wait. Wait!
-I'll call you back.

191
00:16:40.805 --> 00:16:43.344
Hello? Was that the end
of the instructions?

192
00:16:44.373 --> 00:16:47.034
Okay. All right. You can do this.

193
00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:51.093
What was the first thing he said to do?

194
00:16:52.670 --> 00:16:54.729
Right. Relax.

195
00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.944
Twenty minutes ago an energy surge
knocked our power

196
00:17:18.094 --> 00:17:20.663
across the entire Pacific Northwest.
What do we know?

197
00:17:20.862 --> 00:17:23.227
Our first instinct was it was an EMP.

198
00:17:23.998 --> 00:17:26.728
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

199
00:17:26.910 --> 00:17:29.360
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

200
00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:32.433
The Department of Energy says
it's not a power plant malfunction.

201
00:17:32.537 --> 00:17:35.368
Sounds like we're really good
at figuring out what it wasn't.

202
00:17:35.496 --> 00:17:37.586
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

203
00:17:37.725 --> 00:17:40.943
I'm suggesting we scramble
the fifth and sixth regiment. - No, no...

204
00:17:41.099 --> 00:17:45.284
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.
Someone who understands technology.

205
00:17:45.441 --> 00:17:48.128
-You wanna send in a lab rat?
-Not just any lab rat.

206
00:17:48.293 --> 00:17:49.453
A lab rat with the teeth.

207
00:17:49.555 --> 00:17:51.971
You're not suggesting who I think
you're suggesting.

208
00:17:52.085 --> 00:17:53.995
-I know he's a little weird--
-Weird?

209
00:17:54.113 --> 00:17:56.576
-No, no. No way!
-He's a psychological terrifier.

210
00:17:56.701 --> 00:18:00.009
But he's also brilliant. Five PhDs.
IQ off the charts.

211
00:18:00.171 --> 00:18:02.797
And his drone tech is revolutionary.

212
00:18:02.951 --> 00:18:06.669
-You're sure he can handle this?
-He has a perfect operations record.

213
00:18:06.977 --> 00:18:08.880
-Remember the coup in Pakistan?
-No.

214
00:18:09.016 --> 00:18:11.741
-Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?
-It's not even a country.

215
00:18:11.873 --> 00:18:14.867
Exactly. And you can thank
Robotnik for that.

216
00:18:15.005 --> 00:18:18.268
I can't believe you're bringing
that freak into this.

217
00:18:18.521 --> 00:18:20.899
Neither can I, but...

218
00:18:21.199 --> 00:18:22.846
We have no choice.

219
00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.454
Guys, coming up!

220
00:18:33.916 --> 00:18:35.411
Yes, Major.

221
00:18:48.616 --> 00:18:49.693
What a--

222
00:19:11.207 --> 00:19:12.522
Are you in charge here?

223
00:19:12.644 --> 00:19:15.059
-Yes, I am.
-No. Wrong!

224
00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:16.502
-Name--
-I'm in charge!

225
00:19:16.651 --> 00:19:17.999
-Me!
-Is Major--

226
00:19:18.162 --> 00:19:20.135
-Ben--
-I'm in charge.

227
00:19:21.238 --> 00:19:23.348
You've never seen anything
like this before?

228
00:19:23.583 --> 00:19:27.926
It says I'm a top banana in a world
full of hungry little monkeys.

229
00:19:28.051 --> 00:19:29.769
Allow me to clarify.

230
00:19:30.349 --> 00:19:33.280
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy
based on level of critical importance

231
00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.468
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify. Agent Stone.

232
00:19:36.638 --> 00:19:40.242
-The Doctor thinks you're basic.
-I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

233
00:19:40.465 --> 00:19:42.978
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

234
00:19:43.938 --> 00:19:45.901
-Is he still looking at me funny?
-Yes, he is.

235
00:19:46.043 --> 00:19:48.171
Tell him to stop or I'll pull out
his search history.

236
00:19:48.284 --> 00:19:50.825
If you don't stop looking, the Doctor,
he'll take a closer look--

237
00:19:50.975 --> 00:19:54.107
-I'm not deaf.
-And tell him his men report to me now.

238
00:19:54.910 --> 00:19:57.712
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you're realize--

239
00:19:57.841 --> 00:19:59.522
I'm sorry, Major, what was your name?

240
00:19:59.666 --> 00:20:03.110
-Benning--
-Nobody cares! Nobody cares.

241
00:20:03.402 --> 00:20:05.610
Listen, Major Nobodycares.

242
00:20:05.756 --> 00:20:07.906
You know why
nobody cares who you are?

243
00:20:08.177 --> 00:20:10.925
Because nobody cares about your feeble
accomplishments.

244
00:20:11.056 --> 00:20:13.531
And nobody cares about how proud
your Mommy is

245
00:20:13.683 --> 00:20:16.115
that you're now reading
at a third grade level.

246
00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:20.828
Have you finished 'Charlotte's Web' yet?
Spoiler alert, she dies in the end.

247
00:20:20.958 --> 00:20:23.589
But she leaves a big creepy egg sac.

248
00:20:25.201 --> 00:20:27.358
Oh, my babies.

249
00:20:28.097 --> 00:20:30.486
Look what came out of my egg sac.

250
00:20:30.675 --> 00:20:32.758
You know what I love about machines?

251
00:20:33.684 --> 00:20:36.817
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

252
00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:40.577
They don't need time-off to get drunk,
and put the boat in the water.

253
00:20:40.992 --> 00:20:42.916
And you do what you're told.

254
00:20:43.062 --> 00:20:45.543
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss.

255
00:20:46.616 --> 00:20:49.046
And watch my machines do your job.

256
00:20:51.472 --> 00:20:54.263
-Can you feel it, Stone?
-I can feel it, Doctor.

257
00:20:54.651 --> 00:20:56.251
It's evolution, Stone.

258
00:20:57.607 --> 00:20:59.418
It's evolution!

259
00:21:34.620 --> 00:21:36.778
-Agent Stone?
-Doctor.

260
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:39.430
Do you see anything useful in this image?

261
00:21:40.324 --> 00:21:42.741
-Nothing at all, Doctor.
-Of course you don't.

262
00:21:43.071 --> 00:21:45.060
Your eyes weren't expertly trained
to spot tracks

263
00:21:45.223 --> 00:21:47.490
by the Native American Shadow Wolves.

264
00:21:57.610 --> 00:21:59.150
That's extraordinary.

265
00:21:59.348 --> 00:22:01.528
No, what extraordinary is...

266
00:22:01.681 --> 00:22:05.362
I determined the exact height, weight,
and spinal curvature of this creature.

267
00:22:05.527 --> 00:22:08.387
And my computer can't find
a single match for it, anywhere

268
00:22:08.733 --> 00:22:10.962
in Earth's animal kingdom.

269
00:22:11.263 --> 00:22:15.550
This blackout was not a terrorist attack,
and that's no baby Bigfoot.

270
00:22:16.107 --> 00:22:19.218
This guy is something else

271
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:22.603
entirely.

272
00:22:22.965 --> 00:22:25.769
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

273
00:22:26.364 --> 00:22:28.808
That's one small step for man,

274
00:22:28.966 --> 00:22:31.293
one giant leap for me.

275
00:22:42.621 --> 00:22:44.571
Okay, okay. Everything is fine.

276
00:22:44.731 --> 00:22:46.783
You played some baseball,
got a little upset.

277
00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:50.193
Lightning shut out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

278
00:22:50.823 --> 00:22:52.887
All right, all right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

279
00:22:53.017 --> 00:22:55.843
Time for plan B - Mushroomville.
I gotta take my stuff.

280
00:22:55.944 --> 00:22:57.831
Okay, essential items only.

281
00:22:57.974 --> 00:23:00.731
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night light, funny hat.

282
00:23:01.112 --> 00:23:03.979
This half-eaten cantaloupe,
and my scented candle.

283
00:23:04.331 --> 00:23:05.965
My entire comic book collection.

284
00:23:06.079 --> 00:23:08.750
Bean bag chair, can a bean bag chair
fit in the backpack? No, no.

285
00:23:08.945 --> 00:23:10.363
Of course not. That's stupid.

286
00:23:10.508 --> 00:23:13.783
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course!

287
00:23:15.130 --> 00:23:18.481
Here we go. Ring time.
Mushroom planet, here I come.

288
00:23:19.187 --> 00:23:22.182
Oh, no! They're right outside,
I gotta go somewhere else.

289
00:23:26.979 --> 00:23:28.816
Goodbye, cave.

290
00:23:32.833 --> 00:23:34.323
-Hi.
-Hey.

291
00:23:34.491 --> 00:23:35.531
What are you doing?

292
00:23:35.686 --> 00:23:38.414
Just coloring with Jojo and Rachel.

293
00:23:38.774 --> 00:23:40.427
That sounds half-fun.

294
00:23:40.572 --> 00:23:42.882
Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

295
00:23:43.035 --> 00:23:44.840
The whole town went dark.

296
00:23:44.959 --> 00:23:47.137
It was like a sign telling me
to get outta Dodge.

297
00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:49.142
-Wade must've lost his mind.
-Yeah.

298
00:23:49.381 --> 00:23:51.297
And he does not have much to lose.

299
00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:54.117
How's your sister? Does she
convince you to leave me yet?

300
00:23:54.248 --> 00:23:57.562
No, but she did tell me to check
your phone for dating apps.

301
00:23:57.713 --> 00:24:00.144
The only apps on my phone
are the ones that came with it.

302
00:24:00.306 --> 00:24:02.517
-And the Olive Garden.
-Ah, because when you're there--

303
00:24:02.648 --> 00:24:04.360
You're family.

304
00:24:05.985 --> 00:24:07.681
No way!

305
00:24:10.189 --> 00:24:13.437
The racoons are back.
And they are in for a surprise.

306
00:24:13.564 --> 00:24:16.943
Your surprise better not be
my tranquilizer gun. They're just hungry.

307
00:24:17.203 --> 00:24:19.672
And also, that's for bears.

308
00:24:20.564 --> 00:24:22.604
-Good, now I know it'll work.
-Tom!

309
00:24:22.784 --> 00:24:25.158
I'm kidding, I'm just gonna use it
to scare them.

310
00:24:25.272 --> 00:24:27.820
-Possibly to death. Love you, honey, bye.
-To--

311
00:24:32.365 --> 00:24:35.091
D-I-V-O-R-S-E.

312
00:24:37.206 --> 00:24:41.047
Okay, I'm in. With minimal damage
to Donut Lord's property.

313
00:24:42.179 --> 00:24:43.123
Here we go.

314
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:46.553
Didn't work out on Earth, but that's okay.
You're going to a safe world.

315
00:24:46.689 --> 00:24:52.134
A nice safe world full of mushrooms.
Mushrooms there will be your only friends.

316
00:24:52.222 --> 00:24:54.180
That sounds awful, I can't do this.

317
00:24:54.325 --> 00:24:56.571
You have to do it,
there's no other option.

318
00:24:58.550 --> 00:24:59.977
All right.

319
00:25:01.001 --> 00:25:04.376
SFPD, pending background check.
Paws in the air!

320
00:25:06.993 --> 00:25:09.149
Uhhh... meow?

321
00:25:17.803 --> 00:25:20.737
San Francisco?

322
00:25:42.937 --> 00:25:44.383
No.

323
00:25:48.938 --> 00:25:50.143
What?

324
00:26:12.915 --> 00:26:14.543
The Blue Devil.

325
00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:29.397
-Donut Lord?
-You can talk?

326
00:26:30.444 --> 00:26:31.623
You're not--

327
00:26:31.787 --> 00:26:34.798
-You're not here to abduct me, are you?
-You abducted me!

328
00:26:36.061 --> 00:26:38.327
Okay, it's a fair point. What are you?

329
00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.257
Why are you hiding out in my garage?

330
00:26:40.391 --> 00:26:41.591
I needed somewhere safe,

331
00:26:41.737 --> 00:26:44.278
and you are the only person
I could think of, Donut Lord.

332
00:26:44.406 --> 00:26:47.162
-Why do you keep calling me Donut Lord?
-'Cause you talk to donuts,

333
00:26:47.321 --> 00:26:49.199
and then eat them
if they get out of the line.

334
00:26:49.327 --> 00:26:51.626
-Again, fair.
-Wait... Where are all the mushrooms?

335
00:26:51.762 --> 00:26:56.274
Why am I still on Earth? What did--
Oh, no, I lost my rings!

336
00:26:56.391 --> 00:26:57.790
What?

337
00:27:03.261 --> 00:27:05.656
What's happening?
Is this your mothership?

338
00:27:06.723 --> 00:27:09.289
-I'm not in the mood to get probed.
-You think you're worried?

339
00:27:09.414 --> 00:27:11.056
I'm not even wearing pants.

340
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:15.935
What a--

341
00:27:17.336 --> 00:27:19.581
-They're coming for me!
-Who's coming for you?

342
00:27:19.673 --> 00:27:22.329
-What does that have to do with me?
-I don't have time to explain,

343
00:27:22.456 --> 00:27:25.142
-but you have to help me.
-No, I don't. Why?

344
00:27:25.291 --> 00:27:28.613
Well, my legs, which normally
would be classified as lethal weapons

345
00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:29.933
feel like spaghetti.

346
00:27:30.031 --> 00:27:33.174
I need your help, please.
It's life or death.

347
00:27:40.569 --> 00:27:42.389
Fine, come with me.

348
00:27:45.806 --> 00:27:47.420
Little help?

349
00:27:58.281 --> 00:28:01.459
-All right, stay here. And be quiet.
-Good plan, great plan.

350
00:28:01.598 --> 00:28:05.459
How are we working so well together?
Practically finishing each other sentences.

351
00:28:06.749 --> 00:28:07.917
Okay, bye.

352
00:28:11.363 --> 00:28:12.853
Hello there.

353
00:28:13.562 --> 00:28:15.106
Can I help you?

354
00:28:18.535 --> 00:28:20.609
Good morning, my rural chum.

355
00:28:21.105 --> 00:28:22.232
I'm...

356
00:28:22.521 --> 00:28:24.988
from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

357
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.387
If you don't mind I'd like to take
a few readings inside your house?

358
00:28:28.510 --> 00:28:30.447
No kidding, you're from
the power company?

359
00:28:30.583 --> 00:28:33.524
You must know my buddy Spencer.
We play softball together.

360
00:28:33.668 --> 00:28:36.307
Spence, he's a good man.

361
00:28:37.588 --> 00:28:40.135
-Yeah, yeah... come on in!
-Great.

362
00:28:40.278 --> 00:28:42.577
Take all the readings
you need. Except...

363
00:28:43.543 --> 00:28:46.812
Don't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?

364
00:28:46.930 --> 00:28:49.203
That way they can check
even if you're not home.

365
00:28:49.467 --> 00:28:51.957
Also, my buddy Spencer
works at the gas company.

366
00:28:52.083 --> 00:28:55.026
And he's more of an ultimate Frisbee guy.
So, you wanna tell me why

367
00:28:55.323 --> 00:28:58.633
you think I'm dumb enough
to just let you walk inside my house?

368
00:29:06.575 --> 00:29:09.088
-I'm sorry, Mr..?
-Wachowski.

369
00:29:09.239 --> 00:29:10.783
But everyone calls me Tom.

370
00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:13.021
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

371
00:29:13.154 --> 00:29:16.625
But it's go on for so long now that
it would be just weird if I corrected him.

372
00:29:16.771 --> 00:29:18.872
Well, Tom, whose dentist calls him Tim.

373
00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:23.056
You may have noticed that this entire town
has been experiencing a power outage.

374
00:29:23.197 --> 00:29:25.024
Yup, no lights, picked up on that.

375
00:29:25.075 --> 00:29:27.095
Twenty minutes ago I tracked
an energy pulse

376
00:29:27.224 --> 00:29:30.372
with the similar signature to the one
that caused that disruption.

377
00:29:45.052 --> 00:29:46.814
Listen, Mr..?

378
00:29:46.961 --> 00:29:49.526
Doctor. Doctor Robotnik.

379
00:29:49.705 --> 00:29:51.565
But my dentist calls me Rob.

380
00:29:52.857 --> 00:29:55.944
Look, Doctor Robotskiz...

381
00:29:56.467 --> 00:29:58.515
I'm sure what you're here for
is very serious,

382
00:29:58.645 --> 00:30:01.454
but it's got nothing to do with me,
you can ask anyone in town.

383
00:30:01.568 --> 00:30:03.256
-Everyone knows me.
-I bet they do.

384
00:30:03.405 --> 00:30:05.818
I'm sure you hella popular
with a Gabs and Murls

385
00:30:06.039 --> 00:30:09.148
and Billy Bobs in this glorified
gas station rest stop.

386
00:30:09.466 --> 00:30:13.520
Which goes way back to the days
of tipping cows and playing on a jug band.

387
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:19.218
And maybe some day
you've achieved your goal

388
00:30:19.369 --> 00:30:22.136
of getting a Costco card,
or adopting a Labradoodle.

389
00:30:22.294 --> 00:30:27.564
But the reality is, I surpassed
everything you're ever going to do

390
00:30:29.442 --> 00:30:31.339
before I was a toddler.

391
00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:35.061
I was spitting out formulas
while you were still spitting up formula.

392
00:30:35.187 --> 00:30:37.763
-I was breastfed, actually.
-Nice.

393
00:30:37.997 --> 00:30:40.213
Rub that in my orphan face.

394
00:30:40.431 --> 00:30:46.236
Mr. Wachowski, are you familiar
with US code 904, title 10, article 104?

395
00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:49.399
-Yeah--
-Anyone, who attempts to aid

396
00:30:49.558 --> 00:30:52.390
an enemy of the United States
shall suffer death.

397
00:30:54.262 --> 00:30:56.267
And if I'm the one who catches you,

398
00:30:56.732 --> 00:30:58.587
it'll be even worse.

399
00:30:59.989 --> 00:31:01.439
Worse than death?

400
00:31:03.647 --> 00:31:05.363
Okay, I'm a ball.
Just a normal ball.

401
00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.771
I'm blending in like a bulge.

402
00:31:06.907 --> 00:31:10.665
Stop talking. No, you stop talking.
Be quiet, Sonic. You be quiet, Sonic!

403
00:31:10.889 --> 00:31:12.919
Oh, I hope they aren't scanning me
with X-Rays,

404
00:31:13.052 --> 00:31:15.316
I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.

405
00:31:22.828 --> 00:31:25.119
Don't freak out. Don't freak--
Don't freak out.

406
00:31:25.278 --> 00:31:27.275
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

407
00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:30.088
I'm freaking out!

408
00:31:32.491 --> 00:31:34.902
Why don't you had
your staircase carpeted?

409
00:31:35.055 --> 00:31:36.398
Compared to--

410
00:31:39.169 --> 00:31:40.756
-Old pipes.
-Yeah.

411
00:31:40.906 --> 00:31:43.547
Probably just the house settling.
Nothing to see here.

412
00:31:45.146 --> 00:31:46.413
Hey!

413
00:31:51.534 --> 00:31:53.010
Here's the thing.

414
00:31:54.758 --> 00:31:56.290
I'm never wrong.

415
00:31:57.054 --> 00:31:59.376
Well, first time for everything, I guess.

416
00:31:59.519 --> 00:32:00.720
Would you like some cake?

417
00:32:00.903 --> 00:32:05.035
I hear racoons have the cleanest mouths
of any animal that routinely eats garbage.

418
00:32:16.316 --> 00:32:18.079
Look at that.

419
00:32:18.586 --> 00:32:20.237
I was right.

420
00:32:20.652 --> 00:32:22.579
Note the lack of surprise.

421
00:32:22.776 --> 00:32:24.505
Should we try this again?

422
00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:39.231
I'm going to give you five seconds
to tell me where it is. Five.

423
00:32:39.358 --> 00:32:41.439
-I don't know what's you're talking about.
-Four.

424
00:32:41.596 --> 00:32:43.964
Hey, tough guy, I'm a cop.
And you're threatening an Officer.

425
00:32:44.097 --> 00:32:46.765
How can you threaten somebody
who never existed? Three.

426
00:32:47.334 --> 00:32:49.327
Come on, rack your brain!

427
00:32:49.494 --> 00:32:52.781
You might be able to come up
with some lame excuse to go on living.

428
00:32:53.019 --> 00:32:54.492
In two...

429
00:32:55.233 --> 00:32:56.497
One!

430
00:32:56.863 --> 00:32:58.826
Wait! Don't hurt him.

431
00:33:12.398 --> 00:33:14.068
This feels excessive.

432
00:33:17.513 --> 00:33:18.655
Stay behind me.

433
00:33:34.848 --> 00:33:37.311
Don't worry, I got it
right where I want it.

434
00:33:39.891 --> 00:33:43.315
Can you believe Amazon is gonna deliver
packages with these thing?

435
00:33:45.794 --> 00:33:48.560
This was a horrible plan,
what was I thinking?

436
00:33:51.189 --> 00:33:52.860
I'm gonna puke!

437
00:33:56.505 --> 00:33:57.598
Come on!

438
00:33:58.523 --> 00:33:59.778
We gotta get out of here.

439
00:33:59.947 --> 00:34:03.007
Don't tell me that's all you've got.
I'm just getting started.

440
00:34:03.132 --> 00:34:05.863
Let me know if you wanna go
round two with the blue.

441
00:34:24.690 --> 00:34:25.855
Doctor!

442
00:34:26.223 --> 00:34:27.306
Are you okay?

443
00:34:27.603 --> 00:34:29.641
I just saw a guy race
outta here and thought--

444
00:34:29.767 --> 00:34:31.204
That you should stop them?

445
00:34:32.321 --> 00:34:33.862
Open your mouth,

446
00:34:34.066 --> 00:34:36.094
and say you thought
that you should stop them.

447
00:34:36.254 --> 00:34:39.408
No, I thought that maybe I should
check to see if you're okay.

448
00:34:39.705 --> 00:34:42.430
You know what's hard about being
the smartest person in the world?

449
00:34:42.567 --> 00:34:45.460
-Everyone else seems stupid.
-Yes. Way to go.

450
00:34:45.695 --> 00:34:47.150
You got that one.

451
00:34:48.392 --> 00:34:52.099
Whatever this creature is,
it's our job to secure it,

452
00:34:52.601 --> 00:34:55.786
neutralize it, uncover
the source of its power.

453
00:34:56.379 --> 00:34:57.840
And if it resists...

454
00:34:58.884 --> 00:35:00.437
we take it apart,

455
00:35:01.048 --> 00:35:02.458
piece by piece.

456
00:35:03.654 --> 00:35:05.566
See what makes it tick.

457
00:35:06.545 --> 00:35:07.957
-Stone.
-Doctor.

458
00:35:08.104 --> 00:35:09.760
Call Optical Illusions.

459
00:35:10.419 --> 00:35:12.147
Tell them I need new frames.

460
00:35:12.784 --> 00:35:14.391
They know what kind I like.

461
00:35:16.244 --> 00:35:17.891
And bring that quill.

462
00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.766
Yes, Doctor.

463
00:35:23.057 --> 00:35:24.321
All right, pal,

464
00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:26.049
You need to start talking right now.

465
00:35:26.181 --> 00:35:28.544
Who are you? <i>What</i> are you?

466
00:35:28.713 --> 00:35:31.051
I'm a hedgehog,
I feel like that's obvious.

467
00:35:31.247 --> 00:35:33.825
-And I'm in big trouble.
-You're in big trouble?

468
00:35:33.961 --> 00:35:36.939
You're not the one who punched
some sort of government weirdo back there.

469
00:35:37.065 --> 00:35:39.305
You think you have problems?
I lost my rings!

470
00:35:39.435 --> 00:35:40.969
Rings? What are you talking about?

471
00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.573
Okay, rings are how all advanced cultures
travel between worlds.

472
00:35:44.943 --> 00:35:47.281
And now mine are on top
of a pointy building

473
00:35:47.433 --> 00:35:50.204
I've only ever seen
on your skin tight t-shirt.

474
00:35:50.561 --> 00:35:52.722
So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco,

475
00:35:52.934 --> 00:35:56.061
so I can get back my rings and use them
to go to the Mushroom planet.

476
00:35:57.912 --> 00:36:00.256
-Mushroom planet?
-Yes!

477
00:36:00.659 --> 00:36:01.785
Right.

478
00:36:05.646 --> 00:36:08.238
-Okay, pal. Out you go.
-I'm sorry, what?

479
00:36:08.384 --> 00:36:12.251
Look, this is the worst possible time
for me to get myself into trouble, okay?

480
00:36:12.360 --> 00:36:14.484
You asked me to save your life,
I saved your life.

481
00:36:14.607 --> 00:36:17.538
Now please, go find your rings,
and your Mushroomland.

482
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:19.810
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up
in the hospital bed,

483
00:36:19.969 --> 00:36:22.758
and the doctors gonna tell me
that my colonoscopy was a big success.

484
00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.120
-Okay? So, goodbye.
-Okay, goodbye.

485
00:36:25.638 --> 00:36:26.741
Goodbye.

486
00:36:29.282 --> 00:36:32.042
-Why aren't you leaving?
-I don't know where San Francisco is.

487
00:36:32.181 --> 00:36:33.079
- It's West.
- West?

488
00:36:33.292 --> 00:36:35.558
- Straight shot, can't miss it.
- Fine. That's cool.

489
00:36:35.689 --> 00:36:37.733
I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.

490
00:36:42.656 --> 00:36:46.498
So, as I crashed into the cold
dark water of the Pacific

491
00:36:46.838 --> 00:36:48.641
I realized a few things.

492
00:36:49.176 --> 00:36:51.379
a) I have no idea where I'm going;

493
00:36:51.713 --> 00:36:53.743
b) salt water stings.

494
00:36:54.168 --> 00:36:58.320
c) I shouldn't even be on this planet
right now, but I am.

495
00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:01.257
-Why? Because you shot me!
-I know.

496
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:02.551
You shot me!

497
00:37:02.692 --> 00:37:05.359
All right. I heard you the first time.
You don't have to...

498
00:37:05.494 --> 00:37:07.001
pile it on, good grief.

499
00:37:07.179 --> 00:37:09.308
I'm wet. I'm cold.

500
00:37:09.677 --> 00:37:11.417
There's a fish on my head!

501
00:37:11.679 --> 00:37:15.078
And clearly I'm not gonna be able
to do this on my own.

502
00:37:21.053 --> 00:37:23.735
-All right, get in the truck.
-Really? You gonna help me?

503
00:37:23.819 --> 00:37:27.009
I guess it is a little bit of my fault
that all of this happening to you.

504
00:37:27.141 --> 00:37:30.034
Not a little bit, entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

505
00:37:30.177 --> 00:37:32.083
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

506
00:37:32.206 --> 00:37:33.313
Yes.

507
00:37:35.807 --> 00:37:37.668
Roadtrip.

508
00:37:38.163 --> 00:37:39.606
What am I doing?

509
00:37:40.032 --> 00:37:42.592
All right, there's gonna be rules
on this trip. Number one:

510
00:37:42.725 --> 00:37:44.929
do exactly as I say all the time.

511
00:37:45.386 --> 00:37:47.223
-Got it?
-Got it, Donut Lord.

512
00:37:47.366 --> 00:37:49.200
Would you stop with the Donut Lord?

513
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.404
I have a name. It's Tom.

514
00:37:51.742 --> 00:37:53.071
I'm Sonic.

515
00:37:53.265 --> 00:37:55.415
Sonic? Sonic.

516
00:37:56.535 --> 00:37:58.716
So, you've been spying
on us all for years.

517
00:37:58.859 --> 00:38:00.590
I mean, I wouldn't call it spying.

518
00:38:00.722 --> 00:38:02.978
We were all just hanging out,
only I wasn't invited,

519
00:38:03.105 --> 00:38:04.612
and no one knew I was there.

520
00:38:04.747 --> 00:38:07.378
I can't believe Crazy Carl
was right all this time.

521
00:38:07.526 --> 00:38:10.428
Yeah, you should call him
Super Observing Carl instead.

522
00:38:10.997 --> 00:38:13.277
-Oh my God, stop the car right now!
-What? What?

523
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:16.763
The World's Largest Rubber Band Ball?
We gotta see it!

524
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:20.358
No, no. This is not some fun
family roadtrip, okay?

525
00:38:20.607 --> 00:38:24.605
The government wants to dissect you,
and arrest me. This is serious.

526
00:38:26.235 --> 00:38:28.646
You were right. It was lame.
Gift shop was cool, though.

527
00:38:28.887 --> 00:38:30.112
I got you a mouse pad.

528
00:38:30.386 --> 00:38:31.971
When are we gonna get there?

529
00:38:32.005 --> 00:38:33.893
We will get there when we get there.

530
00:38:52.937 --> 00:38:56.251
All right, I'm gonna go check in with Wade
to see if he knows what's going on.

531
00:38:56.388 --> 00:38:58.575
You gonna see Wade in that glass thing?

532
00:38:58.726 --> 00:39:00.674
What is it? A teleportation box?

533
00:39:02.434 --> 00:39:03.386
It's a pay phone.

534
00:39:03.535 --> 00:39:06.944
It's mostly for drug dealers and fugitives
from the law, which is us.

535
00:39:07.159 --> 00:39:09.595
Stay in the car. I don't want
anybody seeing you.

536
00:39:09.889 --> 00:39:11.197
Fine!

537
00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:34.379
Okay. Okay. That is the coolest place
on Earth, but you have to stay in the car.

538
00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:45.916
Be strong. Be strong.

539
00:39:53.194 --> 00:39:55.354
Hello. Green Hills Police Department.

540
00:39:55.504 --> 00:39:58.284
-Wade, it's me.
-Hi, I'm so glad that you called.

541
00:39:58.666 --> 00:40:02.943
So, some guys came in asking
some questions. A little creepy.

542
00:40:03.308 --> 00:40:05.637
Kinda reminded me of guys
from Men in Black,

543
00:40:05.755 --> 00:40:09.225
but not as likable,
or charming as Will Smith.

544
00:40:09.359 --> 00:40:10.963
Wait, what kinda questions?

545
00:40:11.122 --> 00:40:13.379
Questions about terrorism.

546
00:40:13.885 --> 00:40:16.897
I told them that, like--
I've gone ice fishing with Tom.

547
00:40:17.208 --> 00:40:20.967
He doesn't know how to make a bomb.
He can't even make, like bait in the cold.

548
00:40:21.096 --> 00:40:23.245
All right, Wade, listen to me.
This is really important.

549
00:40:23.371 --> 00:40:25.461
Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

550
00:40:28.398 --> 00:40:30.500
You know, I think they already know.

551
00:40:32.449 --> 00:40:34.055
Mr. Wachowski.

552
00:40:34.989 --> 00:40:36.142
Tom.

553
00:40:36.168 --> 00:40:38.125
I want you to know
that the only other person

554
00:40:38.187 --> 00:40:41.255
who have ever punched me
in the face was the school bully.

555
00:40:41.384 --> 00:40:44.189
He hit me in the cafeteria
causing a blunt force contusion

556
00:40:44.339 --> 00:40:46.728
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

557
00:40:46.802 --> 00:40:48.901
Humiliated me in front
of the entire school.

558
00:40:49.054 --> 00:40:51.176
And you know what I did in response?

559
00:40:51.333 --> 00:40:53.942
I'm assuming that you reported him
to the Principal's office,

560
00:40:54.057 --> 00:40:56.435
'cause, you know that kinda behavior
is really unacceptable.

561
00:40:56.597 --> 00:40:59.501
No, I examined the inefficiency
of a world with blunt traumed brain,

562
00:40:59.639 --> 00:41:02.437
and I used technology
to resolve that inefficiency.

563
00:41:02.584 --> 00:41:05.310
The boy ate his meals
through a straw for a year.

564
00:41:05.581 --> 00:41:08.725
And I have never lost
a fight again. Until today.

565
00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:10.705
Hooray for me then, huh?

566
00:41:10.817 --> 00:41:13.462
No, because you're about
to become the bully with a straw!

567
00:41:13.610 --> 00:41:15.803
I'm coming for you, Mr. Wachowski.

568
00:41:16.198 --> 00:41:18.140
And when I catch you I'll--

569
00:41:19.105 --> 00:41:21.110
Hello? Hello?

570
00:41:22.225 --> 00:41:24.843
-Hello? Hello?
-I think he actually hung up.

571
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:28.226
-Because I noticed that the light isn't on.
-Thank you, Officer Brainfart.

572
00:41:28.357 --> 00:41:30.641
If you give me a second
I can get an outside line.

573
00:41:30.776 --> 00:41:34.747
No, don't be bothered.
You just sit there and be <i>you-</i>

574
00:41:35.953 --> 00:41:37.501
<i>sless.</i>

575
00:41:44.434 --> 00:41:47.091
No one's gonna erase my memory here?

576
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:50.255
I will tell people about this.

577
00:41:53.361 --> 00:41:56.470
Okay, not exactly
the healthiest meal, but...

578
00:41:57.664 --> 00:41:58.822
Sonic?

579
00:42:05.076 --> 00:42:06.424
No, no.

580
00:42:21.723 --> 00:42:23.046
Howdy, partner.

581
00:42:23.169 --> 00:42:24.958
I'm not your partner, come on,
we're leaving.

582
00:42:25.083 --> 00:42:27.821
But there's a ZZ Top cover band,
you gotta see their beards.

583
00:42:27.904 --> 00:42:30.368
We will have to catch them
some other time. Let's go. Get up.

584
00:42:30.505 --> 00:42:33.817
If we stay I promise I won't say
another word for the rest of the trip.

585
00:42:33.963 --> 00:42:35.380
Starting... now.

586
00:42:35.953 --> 00:42:38.345
Welcome to the Piston Pit,
what can I get you fellas?

587
00:42:38.571 --> 00:42:42.964
I want nachos and buffalo wings, and guac.
Funny word, isn't it? Guac. Guac.

588
00:42:43.702 --> 00:42:46.634
No kids allowed in here.
What's he got on, some kinda mask?

589
00:42:47.415 --> 00:42:51.999
He's actually 43 years old,
and suffers from a very rare skin disease.

590
00:42:52.147 --> 00:42:54.490
that stunts his growth,
and makes him look...

591
00:42:54.847 --> 00:42:56.247
like-- like that.

592
00:42:56.386 --> 00:43:00.318
The face I was born with, the confidence
I picked up along the way.

593
00:43:00.902 --> 00:43:03.263
-Make us a Mellow Yellow please.
-Okay.

594
00:43:04.369 --> 00:43:07.107
-You owe me one.
-I've never sat on the bar stool before.

595
00:43:07.263 --> 00:43:10.424
So squishy. Oh, look at this, it spins!

596
00:43:11.239 --> 00:43:12.505
Yes.

597
00:43:13.162 --> 00:43:15.166
-I feel sick.
-Having fun?

598
00:43:15.458 --> 00:43:18.225
Gonna check this off your bucket list,
huh? Big night for ya?

599
00:43:18.344 --> 00:43:20.173
What's a bucket list?

600
00:43:20.379 --> 00:43:22.051
Bucket list is a...

601
00:43:22.456 --> 00:43:25.657
It's a list of things you wanna do
in your life before you...

602
00:43:26.311 --> 00:43:27.474
well, kick the bucket.

603
00:43:27.585 --> 00:43:30.509
I've never kicked the bucket
either. I gotta make my list.

604
00:43:36.286 --> 00:43:37.705
Sonic.

605
00:43:44.715 --> 00:43:45.827
Why? What's the matter?

606
00:43:45.979 --> 00:43:47.835
There are so much stuff
I've never done.

607
00:43:47.994 --> 00:43:50.275
And now that I'm leaving Earth forever...

608
00:43:50.811 --> 00:43:52.618
I guess I missed my chance.

609
00:43:57.781 --> 00:44:01.155
Well, I guess this is the kinda place
you can get a lot of live and done

610
00:44:01.298 --> 00:44:03.024
in a short period of time.

611
00:44:03.590 --> 00:44:05.295
I suppose we can spare an hour.

612
00:44:05.472 --> 00:44:07.802
What? You gonna bucket list with me?

613
00:44:08.130 --> 00:44:10.475
-Sure, why not.
-You won't regret this.

614
00:44:10.709 --> 00:44:11.921
I'm pretty sure I will.

615
00:44:36.701 --> 00:44:38.237
New high score.

616
00:44:44.473 --> 00:44:48.245
Wait a second, does this bull missing
a head or does it have two butts?

617
00:44:50.631 --> 00:44:52.743
-This is easy.
-Okay.

618
00:44:57.482 --> 00:44:59.185
I'm a cowboy, baby.

619
00:45:02.208 --> 00:45:03.693
I'm okay.

620
00:45:10.164 --> 00:45:11.310
Yeah!

621
00:45:13.646 --> 00:45:15.258
Yeah, laugh it up.

622
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:17.056
Nice work, Romeo.

623
00:45:17.535 --> 00:45:20.211
-Glad you're having a good time.
-I am having a good time.

624
00:45:20.323 --> 00:45:23.039
I'm having the best time,
I mean what could go wrong?

625
00:45:27.078 --> 00:45:28.310
Can we help you?

626
00:45:28.663 --> 00:45:32.649
-We don't like your kind around here.
-Our kind? What kind is that?

627
00:45:34.747 --> 00:45:35.942
Hipsters.

628
00:45:36.502 --> 00:45:37.555
How dare you?!

629
00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:40.141
Hey, you know what? We were
just leaving anyway, weren't we?

630
00:45:40.278 --> 00:45:41.951
-Not a problem--
-No, no. It's okay.

631
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:43.034
No, no. We're leaving.

632
00:45:43.170 --> 00:45:45.672
I know exactly how to handle
this situation.

633
00:45:46.759 --> 00:45:47.968
Pop quiz hot-shot.

634
00:45:48.113 --> 00:45:50.764
You just picked a fight
with a poorly disguised hedgehog

635
00:45:50.905 --> 00:45:53.744
who's seen way too many
action movies. What do you do?

636
00:45:53.866 --> 00:45:55.521
What do you do?

637
00:45:58.192 --> 00:46:00.373
Am I crazy? It was supposed
to break, right?

638
00:46:02.142 --> 00:46:04.966
Break please. Break please.
Break please, bottle. Please.

639
00:46:05.135 --> 00:46:06.507
Sonic?

640
00:46:18.108 --> 00:46:20.712
-Nice doing.
-Thanks. It's awesome, right?

641
00:46:20.881 --> 00:46:22.868
All right, who's next?
Who wants some?

642
00:46:23.047 --> 00:46:24.625
Who do I get to beat up?

643
00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:29.422
Hey, has anybody seen my waitress?
Still waiting on those buffalo wings.

644
00:46:30.314 --> 00:46:31.804
Ah, you!

645
00:46:43.284 --> 00:46:44.486
Really?

646
00:48:33.433 --> 00:48:36.200
-So, should we get out of here?
-Yeah, time to go.

647
00:48:38.364 --> 00:48:39.385
That was amazing!

648
00:48:39.588 --> 00:48:42.479
Wait a second, did we even pay
our tip? It doesn't matter!

649
00:48:42.662 --> 00:48:45.285
Watch this. Watch this.
I always wanted to do this.

650
00:48:48.539 --> 00:48:51.013
-Get them!
-See ya, suckers.

651
00:48:51.798 --> 00:48:54.366
I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.

652
00:49:00.417 --> 00:49:01.828
-Yes! Yes!
-Yeah!

653
00:49:01.973 --> 00:49:02.604
Ouch!

654
00:49:02.757 --> 00:49:05.614
-They got you pretty good.
-I'm all right, have been hit harder.

655
00:49:05.772 --> 00:49:07.449
Did you see how much
toilet paper I used?

656
00:49:07.597 --> 00:49:11.109
The next person that goes into that
bathroom will have nothing to wipe with.

657
00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:15.280
The floors were sticky. The crowd
was rough. And the odds were against us.

658
00:49:15.518 --> 00:49:18.780
But there was no stopping
Donut Lord and the Blue Blur.

659
00:49:19.148 --> 00:49:21.589
Scratch another one off my list.

660
00:49:22.808 --> 00:49:24.721
You are a weird little dude.

661
00:49:37.233 --> 00:49:39.537
-Okay.
-So, what are we gonna do now?

662
00:49:41.213 --> 00:49:43.273
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.

663
00:49:43.606 --> 00:49:46.094
-You should, too.
-But this is my last night on Earth.

664
00:49:46.226 --> 00:49:48.549
-I wanna soak up every last second.
-All right, well...

665
00:49:48.689 --> 00:49:51.911
Anything you can find to do in this room,
you knock yourself out.

666
00:49:58.475 --> 00:50:00.567
Good times.

667
00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.319
Oh, come on.

668
00:50:04.590 --> 00:50:08.652
-That's awful, what did you eat?
-I think it's called a chili dog.

669
00:50:09.344 --> 00:50:12.034
You might wanna check
your fur on that one, buddy.

670
00:50:12.582 --> 00:50:15.571
Hey, so what's this next planet
you're supposed to go to like?

671
00:50:15.824 --> 00:50:18.679
It's no Earth. I can tell you that.
There's no people.

672
00:50:18.815 --> 00:50:21.736
Just breathable air and giant
mushrooms, and stuff.

673
00:50:22.268 --> 00:50:23.981
Well, look at it this way.

674
00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.608
At least you won't be the only <i>fun-gi</i>.

675
00:50:27.264 --> 00:50:29.819
No, don't ever do that again.

676
00:50:30.957 --> 00:50:32.309
I liked it.

677
00:50:34.175 --> 00:50:36.166
I'm really gonna miss this place.

678
00:50:36.426 --> 00:50:39.981
I know I have to leave Earth to be safe,
but what if Longclaw was wrong?

679
00:50:41.269 --> 00:50:43.274
Maybe I could have a life here.

680
00:50:47.947 --> 00:50:50.286
All right, we should get some sleep.

681
00:50:51.722 --> 00:50:54.878
You sleep, don't worry about me,
I'm gonna stay up all night

682
00:50:55.022 --> 00:50:56.805
enjoying Earth while I can.

683
00:50:56.999 --> 00:50:58.335
Sure, kid.

684
00:50:58.978 --> 00:51:01.122
As long as we're
on the road by eight.

685
00:51:25.016 --> 00:51:29.136
<i>Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing
an act of domestic terrorism.</i>

686
00:51:29.685 --> 00:51:32.333
<i>Wachowski is considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

687
00:51:32.596 --> 00:51:35.608
<i>Any information regarding
his whereabouts should be reported</i>

688
00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.593
<i>to local authorities immediately.</i>

689
00:51:43.813 --> 00:51:45.767
Did he say where he was going?

690
00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:51.118
Maybe. Maybe not.

691
00:51:52.255 --> 00:51:53.958
Like I'd ever tell you.

692
00:51:55.303 --> 00:51:56.862
Stand down, Agent Stone.

693
00:51:56.934 --> 00:51:59.402
This well-meaning citizen obviously
doesn't understand

694
00:51:59.555 --> 00:52:01.513
the urgency of the matter.

695
00:52:03.843 --> 00:52:05.304
Really?

696
00:52:07.562 --> 00:52:10.274
Now, that's what I call
'good cop, bad cop'.

697
00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:14.869
Left yourself open.

698
00:52:17.423 --> 00:52:19.414
Judging by the quickest route
to San Francisco,

699
00:52:19.598 --> 00:52:22.651
the approximate speed of their vehicle
and local weather conditions...

700
00:52:24.237 --> 00:52:25.814
They should be...

701
00:52:26.473 --> 00:52:28.412
right about...

702
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:30.793
here.

703
00:52:31.093 --> 00:52:34.323
-That's brilliant, Sir.
-Thanks... for nothing.

704
00:52:37.254 --> 00:52:39.732
-So, what's on your bucket list?
-Me?

705
00:52:39.866 --> 00:52:42.677
-Yeah, everyone has a bucket list, right?
-Well, sure, but...

706
00:52:42.813 --> 00:52:44.654
I mean, you are the one leaving Earth.

707
00:52:45.035 --> 00:52:47.024
And I'm not planning
on dying anytime soon.

708
00:52:47.171 --> 00:52:50.337
Don't be so sure, your best friend
is a magnet for danger.

709
00:52:50.476 --> 00:52:52.393
You're anointing yourself as the bestie?

710
00:52:53.583 --> 00:52:55.556
Little presumptuous,
but... I mean...

711
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:58.180
I like you, of course, but...

712
00:52:58.409 --> 00:53:00.144
You know, we're not best friends.

713
00:53:00.512 --> 00:53:02.244
You tucked me in last night.

714
00:53:02.448 --> 00:53:05.537
-Fine, fine. Best animal friend.
-That would be my dog Ozzy.

715
00:53:05.646 --> 00:53:09.471
Okay, let's trap this increasingly
humiliating topic of conversation.

716
00:53:09.697 --> 00:53:11.483
Bucket list. Give it to me.

717
00:53:11.908 --> 00:53:13.850
Okay, there is one thing.

718
00:53:14.758 --> 00:53:16.679
In Green Hills I've always felt,

719
00:53:17.062 --> 00:53:20.233
I don't know, more like a baby sitter
than a real cop, you know?

720
00:53:20.421 --> 00:53:23.251
So, I want a chance to prove
myself under real pressure.

721
00:53:23.424 --> 00:53:26.189
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

722
00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:29.449
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

723
00:53:30.611 --> 00:53:31.830
What?

724
00:53:33.094 --> 00:53:36.619
-Why is your face doing that?
-You're leaving Green Hills?!

725
00:53:37.353 --> 00:53:39.341
-Okay.
-Bu-- But-- But why?

726
00:53:39.391 --> 00:53:42.452
-Why would you leave Green Hills?
-This maybe hard for you to understand,

727
00:53:42.591 --> 00:53:45.226
but Green Hills is a small town,
it's a very small town.

728
00:53:45.364 --> 00:53:47.826
It's not small. There are
hundreds of people.

729
00:53:47.985 --> 00:53:49.524
That's a small town, dude.

730
00:53:49.679 --> 00:53:52.335
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

731
00:53:52.440 --> 00:53:55.786
Please, I clean up their gutters,
I jumpstart their cars in the winter.

732
00:53:55.922 --> 00:53:57.613
They can call anybody to do that.

733
00:53:57.736 --> 00:54:01.245
Sure, they can call anybody,
but the don't. They call you.

734
00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:20.487
Eeny meeny miny...

735
00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:23.081
mayhem.

736
00:54:34.115 --> 00:54:36.293
-You're not making any sense.
-Would you calm down?

737
00:54:36.297 --> 00:54:38.335
You come from a great town
with great people,

738
00:54:38.485 --> 00:54:41.135
and by my count zero bad guys
trying to kill you.

739
00:54:43.394 --> 00:54:45.864
Besides, what could possibly
be more important

740
00:54:46.004 --> 00:54:48.320
than protecting the people you care about?

741
00:54:54.356 --> 00:54:55.878
Look, I get--

742
00:54:57.696 --> 00:54:59.023
Yeah!

743
00:55:06.298 --> 00:55:09.973
You know what? I was wrong about you.
You're not the Donut Lord at all.

744
00:55:10.098 --> 00:55:11.956
You're more like the Jerk Lord.

745
00:55:12.105 --> 00:55:14.689
Have you noticed the harpoon
stuck in our dash?!

746
00:55:20.692 --> 00:55:21.555
Sonic!

747
00:55:21.722 --> 00:55:25.320
I was forced from my home,
your home is perfect and you're leaving it.

748
00:55:25.467 --> 00:55:27.105
Why would you do that?

749
00:55:27.230 --> 00:55:29.560
-Your body!
-No, no! Not again!

750
00:55:29.796 --> 00:55:31.592
-Hey, hold on!
-Why?

751
00:55:31.712 --> 00:55:33.081
Because I'm gonna do this.

752
00:55:51.669 --> 00:55:52.877
Sonic!

753
00:55:54.291 --> 00:55:55.702
Sonic!

754
00:55:59.804 --> 00:56:02.270
Guess I had a bonus life.

755
00:56:04.833 --> 00:56:06.028
Yeah, baby!

756
00:56:06.227 --> 00:56:08.403
Sonic - one, big tank - zero.

757
00:56:08.733 --> 00:56:10.583
I'm sorry. Did we
get this on camera?

758
00:56:10.695 --> 00:56:13.065
-How are you not dead?
-I have no idea.

759
00:56:13.516 --> 00:56:14.854
But do you see me dancing?

760
00:56:15.007 --> 00:56:17.516
-Yes, I saw your dance.
-Is that all you've got?

761
00:56:17.662 --> 00:56:19.600
No, but thank you for asking.

762
00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:24.419
Sonic!

763
00:56:24.871 --> 00:56:27.465
-Get back in the truck!
-You go, I'll catch up.

764
00:56:38.652 --> 00:56:40.928
I think that tank just had a baby.

765
00:56:53.515 --> 00:56:54.949
Incoming!

766
00:56:57.067 --> 00:56:59.675
-It's my turn!
-You just had. Now it's mine!

767
00:56:59.838 --> 00:57:01.949
Hey, stop fighting, or I'm taking
that thing away!

768
00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:03.280
Yeah, right, Dad.

769
00:57:15.186 --> 00:57:17.178
-Where are you going?
-Just drive the car.

770
00:57:17.346 --> 00:57:18.861
I'll take care of this.

771
00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:20.915
And if I don't make it, just ditch me,

772
00:57:21.057 --> 00:57:22.433
you seem good at that.

773
00:57:31.949 --> 00:57:34.108
Hey, everyone, welcome back
to my livestream.

774
00:57:34.226 --> 00:57:36.454
Today, we're destroying robots. Step one.

775
00:57:41.636 --> 00:57:43.203
Yes! We did it!

776
00:57:47.944 --> 00:57:50.459
We did not do it. Who is this guy?

777
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:53.039
Ever wonder where your
tax dollars are going?

778
00:57:53.195 --> 00:57:55.532
My turn, here,
just keep us going straight.

779
00:57:55.887 --> 00:57:57.231
I put on cruise control.

780
00:57:57.485 --> 00:58:01.122
I feel just like Vin Diesel.
It's all about family, Tom.

781
00:58:08.301 --> 00:58:12.090
Quick suggestion. Roll up into a ball
and smash him with your body.

782
00:58:13.327 --> 00:58:15.671
Whoa! Where'd you learn how to drive?!

783
00:58:15.849 --> 00:58:18.390
Here, in this truck,
it's happening as we speak.

784
00:58:21.403 --> 00:58:23.323
I can't reach it, bring it in closer.

785
00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:25.830
-What?
-Bring it in closer. Hit the brakes.

786
00:58:26.083 --> 00:58:29.015
-Oh, you mean this one?
-The other brakes!

787
00:58:43.412 --> 00:58:46.580
Give me a big fat break!

788
00:58:52.630 --> 00:58:54.664
This one is cute, let's keep him.

789
00:58:58.266 --> 00:58:59.379
Oh, come on!

790
00:58:59.513 --> 00:59:01.835
How can something so adorable
be so terrible.

791
00:59:05.169 --> 00:59:07.063
You got car insurance, right?

792
00:59:13.450 --> 00:59:14.884
Buzz off!

793
00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:17.956
-That doesn't sound good.
-No, beeping means bad! Get rid of it!

794
00:59:18.070 --> 00:59:18.798
I'm trying.

795
00:59:18.917 --> 00:59:20.891
Just throw it off the window!
Throw it anywhere!

796
00:59:21.018 --> 00:59:23.377
-I can't get it off!
-All right, I'm pulling over.

797
00:59:30.954 --> 00:59:32.785
-Did I get it?
-No.

798
00:59:34.577 --> 00:59:36.147
Here, hold still.

799
00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:38.681
It's going. It's going.

800
00:59:38.929 --> 00:59:40.285
It's still here.

801
00:59:43.431 --> 00:59:46.650
Get off me! Nailed it!

802
00:59:56.317 --> 00:59:57.644
Sonic!

803
01:00:04.777 --> 01:00:05.994
No, no.

804
01:00:13.013 --> 01:00:14.738
Hey, come on.
You're all right.

805
01:00:14.881 --> 01:00:17.048
Wake up. Wake up.

806
01:00:23.784 --> 01:00:25.190
Did we get them?

807
01:00:25.911 --> 01:00:27.789
Oh, no, there they are.

808
01:00:28.057 --> 01:00:30.794
They are real survivors, those two.

809
01:00:35.727 --> 01:00:37.523
Can we have a moment?

810
01:00:39.957 --> 01:00:41.989
Pin yourself to the wall.

811
01:00:42.925 --> 01:00:45.143
You know, I won't miss you
when you're gone.

812
01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:49.208
Human beings are unreliable and stupid,
and I care very little about them.

813
01:00:49.345 --> 01:00:51.682
But my machines are diligent, relentless.

814
01:00:51.890 --> 01:00:53.837
They're everything to me!

815
01:01:08.336 --> 01:01:09.910
<i>Interesting.</i>

816
01:01:31.681 --> 01:01:34.278
Hold on, buddy. You'll be all right.

817
01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.134
You'll be all right.

818
01:01:40.913 --> 01:01:43.751
-I beg you, Rachel. No. It's emergency.
-No, no. Not today. Goodbye. Bye bye.

819
01:01:43.889 --> 01:01:45.868
-Would you stop? Open it please. Maddie!
-Bye. Bye.

820
01:01:45.896 --> 01:01:49.063
-Don't do this to me please. It's important.
-Tom! Oh my God. Rachel let him in!

821
01:01:49.191 --> 01:01:51.967
I am calling the Police. No, I am calling
the FBI. I am calling the CIA.

822
01:01:51.979 --> 01:01:53.472
-I am calling someone.
-Don't do that.

823
01:01:53.531 --> 01:01:55.072
-I'm calling your Mother.
-Okay. Got it.

824
01:01:55.206 --> 01:01:56.983
-Maddie, can we just--
-Tom, what's going on?

825
01:01:57.026 --> 01:01:59.245
You're all over the news.
I've been trying to call you.

826
01:01:59.260 --> 01:02:01.246
I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.

827
01:02:01.247 --> 01:02:02.467
-Ditch his phone?
-Track? You?

828
01:02:02.597 --> 01:02:04.283
-Uncle Tommy!
-Jojo! Hey.

829
01:02:04.413 --> 01:02:07.594
-Now your niece is an accessory to treason.
-She's not.

830
01:02:07.794 --> 01:02:10.900
-Would you calm down.
-Calm down? I will not calm down!

831
01:02:11.052 --> 01:02:14.404
Yes, calm down. Stop talking.
No, Ozzy, please. I know, good to see you.

832
01:02:14.610 --> 01:02:17.489
- No, no! Ozzy, stop!
-Oh, good ol' Lord Baby Jesus!

833
01:02:17.712 --> 01:02:20.429
What is that, Tom?
Is it plutonium? Is it emails?

834
01:02:20.554 --> 01:02:23.945
Yes, it's plutonium. Can we just please--
Can we just go to your room and talk--

835
01:02:23.969 --> 01:02:25.069
Stop it, Ozzy! Quit it!

836
01:02:25.209 --> 01:02:27.727
-This is why I told you he was no good.
-I'm not engaging--

837
01:02:28.015 --> 01:02:29.597
-No, Ozzy, quit it!
-Door now open.

838
01:02:29.725 --> 01:02:30.640
-Locked.
-No, it's unlocked.

839
01:02:31.230 --> 01:02:33.313
Ozzy, no! Ozzy! No, no!

840
01:02:35.005 --> 01:02:36.443
Oh, catch me, Jojo.

841
01:02:38.507 --> 01:02:40.181
Oh, thank God!

842
01:02:41.443 --> 01:02:42.708
Can I get a glass of water?

843
01:04:23.885 --> 01:04:27.365
I just thought you might like a latte
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

844
01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:31.166
What do I look like, an imbecile?
Of course, I want a latte!

845
01:04:31.386 --> 01:04:33.305
I love the way you make them!

846
01:04:39.844 --> 01:04:42.262
Ready the prototype.

847
01:04:42.772 --> 01:04:48.197
With this kind of power my machines
can finally reach their full potential.

848
01:04:54.601 --> 01:04:56.457
He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

849
01:04:57.849 --> 01:05:00.199
Oh, thank God.
He's gonna be okay, right?

850
01:05:00.496 --> 01:05:03.233
I'm a vet, Tom, I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

851
01:05:03.363 --> 01:05:05.322
Well, he's a hedgehog...
Or so he says.

852
01:05:05.527 --> 01:05:07.216
-It talks?
-Almost constantly.

853
01:05:07.521 --> 01:05:08.538
Okay.

854
01:05:10.296 --> 01:05:11.380
-Holy...
-What?

855
01:05:11.555 --> 01:05:13.175
Its pulse is super fast.

856
01:05:13.317 --> 01:05:15.436
Well, that actually
might be normal for him.

857
01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:18.792
-I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie.
-I don't know his physiology.

858
01:05:18.927 --> 01:05:21.845
He doesn't seem to have
any broken bones. He's just...

859
01:05:22.730 --> 01:05:24.270
really banged up.

860
01:05:25.568 --> 01:05:27.535
Look at its poor little feet.

861
01:05:31.144 --> 01:05:33.740
Hang in there, buddy.
You gonna be all right.

862
01:05:36.988 --> 01:05:39.606
Jojo, untie your Mo-- Jojo!

863
01:05:40.033 --> 01:05:42.643
Untie Mommy. Sweetie.

864
01:05:43.346 --> 01:05:44.469
Jojo!

865
01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:48.978
I have to go to the bathroom.

866
01:05:49.125 --> 01:05:50.818
He's gonna be okay, right?

867
01:05:50.967 --> 01:05:53.498
Like he's gonna snap outta this.
He'll wake up soon.

868
01:05:53.695 --> 01:05:55.996
Oh, smelling salts! Don't you have
like vet smelling salts,

869
01:05:56.137 --> 01:05:58.365
like for cats, or parakeets or something?

870
01:05:58.515 --> 01:06:01.433
-No, they don't make cat smelling salts.
-They should.

871
01:06:01.863 --> 01:06:05.942
I have human smelling salts
in my human first aid kit.

872
01:06:07.223 --> 01:06:08.472
Okay.

873
01:06:10.671 --> 01:06:11.819
Come on, buddy.

874
01:06:11.966 --> 01:06:13.298
Gotta go fast!

875
01:06:16.715 --> 01:06:19.074
Where am I? What year is it?
Is the Rock President?

876
01:06:19.200 --> 01:06:21.146
Whoa, whoa, buddy.
You're okay. Calm down.

877
01:06:21.282 --> 01:06:23.488
-Oh, hi Pretzel Lady!
-Hi.

878
01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:25.410
Tom?

879
01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:27.363
-Yeah?
-Can I talk to you please?

880
01:06:30.529 --> 01:06:32.576
Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest.

881
01:06:32.698 --> 01:06:35.890
You got it. I am great at resting.
I rest better than anybody.

882
01:06:36.279 --> 01:06:37.664
Still talking.

883
01:06:37.792 --> 01:06:41.429
First of all, can we take a moment to
acknowledge how under control I've been.

884
01:06:41.544 --> 01:06:42.907
-Amazing.
-Didn't freak out.

885
01:06:43.024 --> 01:06:44.884
-No.
-Totally calm.

886
01:06:45.292 --> 01:06:46.836
Thank you.

887
01:06:47.554 --> 01:06:49.244
Second of all,

888
01:06:49.757 --> 01:06:52.700
what the heck is going on?!
Is that thing an alien?

889
01:06:52.856 --> 01:06:57.262
Okay, so, remember how Crazy Carl
is always going on about the Blue Devil?

890
01:06:58.141 --> 01:07:00.256
-That's him. He's real?
-Dah!

891
01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:02.851
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

892
01:07:03.992 --> 01:07:07.146
I kinda sorta shot our little blue friend
with your tranq gun.

893
01:07:07.271 --> 01:07:09.574
-No, you did not!
-I didn't-- I didn't mean to.

894
01:07:09.689 --> 01:07:11.745
Okay, this is kinda hard
for me to explain.

895
01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:13.546
And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy.

896
01:07:13.672 --> 01:07:17.022
He has to get to the Transamerica
building, and I promised I'd take him.

897
01:07:18.351 --> 01:07:19.486
Aliens?

898
01:07:19.751 --> 01:07:21.760
Maddie, your husband's
lost his mind.

899
01:07:21.907 --> 01:07:25.513
You can use this as an opportunity
to leave him. No one would judge you.

900
01:07:30.518 --> 01:07:32.896
So you won't hurt your feet anymore.

901
01:07:33.394 --> 01:07:34.752
Really?

902
01:07:35.721 --> 01:07:38.034
No one's ever given me a gift before.

903
01:07:38.843 --> 01:07:41.044
I gotta check it off my bucket list.

904
01:07:50.424 --> 01:07:52.345
All right. Lookin' good.

905
01:07:55.468 --> 01:07:56.628
Okay.

906
01:07:56.888 --> 01:07:59.789
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

907
01:08:00.264 --> 01:08:01.639
Well, that's what you're doing.

908
01:08:01.834 --> 01:08:05.338
Blue alien hedgehogs
still count as <i>people</i>, right?

909
01:08:05.496 --> 01:08:06.752
-I think so, too.
-Yeah.

910
01:08:06.881 --> 01:08:08.397
-I think.
-Okay.

911
01:08:08.557 --> 01:08:12.247
I love you. Did I tell you that already?
I don't deserve you, you know that?

912
01:08:12.436 --> 01:08:13.983
I know that.

913
01:08:16.477 --> 01:08:17.465
So,

914
01:08:17.565 --> 01:08:21.149
you're supposed to be Tom's best friend
that he won't shut up about.

915
01:08:22.734 --> 01:08:24.560
Well, I don't see the appeal.

916
01:08:26.343 --> 01:08:29.036
Stop. That is very gross.

917
01:08:31.152 --> 01:08:32.207
-Hey.
-Hey.

918
01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:33.418
So,

919
01:08:33.551 --> 01:08:35.676
my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much total.

920
01:08:35.795 --> 01:08:37.992
You think your sister would mind
if we borrowed her car?

921
01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:39.912
You have got to be kidding me!

922
01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:42.867
-She'll be fine.
-Yes, let's do that.

923
01:08:43.212 --> 01:08:45.404
This is my house!

924
01:08:47.794 --> 01:08:51.088
Whoa, whoa... Now this is my turn.
And I pull around him.

925
01:08:51.236 --> 01:08:53.749
Sorry. And... perfect park.

926
01:08:54.050 --> 01:08:56.770
-What are you, crazy?
-Is there anything you didn't hit?

927
01:08:56.907 --> 01:08:59.660
-Why did we let the alien drive?
-Hey, I got us here.

928
01:08:59.824 --> 01:09:01.734
And please, five stars.

929
01:09:02.926 --> 01:09:04.286
So, this is it?

930
01:09:04.472 --> 01:09:06.119
That's it. That's your pyramid.

931
01:09:06.654 --> 01:09:09.721
-Wow! Look at that thing.
-What happens now?

932
01:09:10.627 --> 01:09:13.197
-Oh, he's... gone.
-Yup.

933
01:09:14.449 --> 01:09:17.157
No good. You need a special key
to get to the roof.

934
01:09:18.138 --> 01:09:19.714
What now?

935
01:09:19.877 --> 01:09:23.069
Time for me to abuse the power
entrusted to me.

936
01:09:32.927 --> 01:09:34.301
We got a jumper on the roof.

937
01:09:34.423 --> 01:09:37.752
Gotta get up there fast, or we gonna have
a human pancake on our hands.

938
01:09:37.923 --> 01:09:40.229
You came all the way from Montana?

939
01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:42.705
Yup, that's how serious it is.

940
01:09:47.145 --> 01:09:48.487
Okay.

941
01:09:49.906 --> 01:09:51.522
You just saved a life.

942
01:09:54.986 --> 01:09:56.346
Come on. Come on.

943
01:10:00.163 --> 01:10:02.812
How much longer?
I can't breathe in here.

944
01:10:04.988 --> 01:10:07.278
Hello? Anybody there?

945
01:10:07.442 --> 01:10:09.396
Do you have your child in that bag?

946
01:10:09.627 --> 01:10:10.770
No.

947
01:10:10.937 --> 01:10:13.384
I mean yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

948
01:10:14.506 --> 01:10:15.883
It's not your child?

949
01:10:16.247 --> 01:10:18.278
Relax, I'm a cop, okay?

950
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.231
Plus he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

951
01:10:20.368 --> 01:10:21.665
Why would I like it in here?

952
01:10:21.805 --> 01:10:24.691
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

953
01:10:25.402 --> 01:10:27.144
Such a kidder.

954
01:10:28.150 --> 01:10:29.566
Okay.

955
01:10:29.677 --> 01:10:32.317
No, I'm scared of the dark!
Is anybody there?

956
01:10:45.507 --> 01:10:47.618
What were you keeping in this bag?

957
01:10:47.851 --> 01:10:49.581
A jar of pickled farts?

958
01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.024
All right, all right,
what are we looking for?

959
01:10:54.574 --> 01:10:55.852
This!

960
01:10:56.313 --> 01:10:58.441
Okay, what happens now?

961
01:10:58.551 --> 01:11:01.963
Now, all I have to do is think of where
I want the other end of the ring to appear,

962
01:11:02.093 --> 01:11:03.785
-and I throw it.
-So, that's it?

963
01:11:04.161 --> 01:11:06.088
-We did it?
-Yeah. We did it.

964
01:11:06.814 --> 01:11:10.303
Hey, sorry we didn't get to do
everything on your bucket list, pal.

965
01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:13.299
It's okay. I did the ones
I needed the most.

966
01:11:14.225 --> 01:11:17.923
-You two are so cute, like...
-Oh, please. What?

967
01:11:18.063 --> 01:11:20.105
-We are not.
-No, we're not cute.

968
01:11:20.245 --> 01:11:23.376
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

969
01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.040
-Exactly. Yeah.
-Really?

970
01:11:25.183 --> 01:11:28.339
And our rules include expressing
heartfelt emotions.

971
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:29.667
If you say so.

972
01:11:29.898 --> 01:11:31.404
Okay then.

973
01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:32.737
All right.

974
01:11:33.813 --> 01:11:35.813
-You gotta go, right?
-Yeah, I gotta go, so...

975
01:11:35.930 --> 01:11:39.102
-I gotta go. We gotta go, too.
-So, see-- All right. Bye bye.

976
01:11:43.298 --> 01:11:44.930
Just one more thing.

977
01:11:53.007 --> 01:11:55.142
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

978
01:11:57.584 --> 01:12:00.411
I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave Green Hills.

979
01:12:00.779 --> 01:12:03.484
Walking away from something
you care about

980
01:12:03.954 --> 01:12:05.641
has to be painful.

981
01:12:05.775 --> 01:12:07.816
You're not sure you really wanna go, huh?

982
01:12:08.653 --> 01:12:11.558
I don't wanna go, but I can't stay.

983
01:12:12.097 --> 01:12:14.868
As long as I'm here
I put everyone in danger.

984
01:12:15.239 --> 01:12:16.734
I can't do that.

985
01:12:17.675 --> 01:12:20.393
I just want you to know
that these last two days

986
01:12:20.527 --> 01:12:24.276
have been the best two days of my life.

987
01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:29.014
You know I never though I'd say this

988
01:12:29.146 --> 01:12:31.656
but I'm actually gonna miss you,
you little Blue Devil.

989
01:12:31.803 --> 01:12:33.849
I'll miss you too, Donut Lord.

990
01:12:34.682 --> 01:12:35.839
Thank you.

991
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:37.830
For what?

992
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:40.041
For saving my life.

993
01:12:58.031 --> 01:13:00.932
Okay, did someone leave
their 'Find my Phone' on?

994
01:13:27.233 --> 01:13:30.294
Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. Wachowski.

995
01:13:30.978 --> 01:13:32.813
Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

996
01:13:32.927 --> 01:13:35.347
It's the government wack job
who keeps trying to kill us,

997
01:13:35.462 --> 01:13:36.291
unsuccessfully.

998
01:13:36.697 --> 01:13:38.775
Nice of you to swing by
on your way to Comic-Con.

999
01:13:38.907 --> 01:13:40.403
Yeah, what are you wearing?

1000
01:13:41.935 --> 01:13:43.411
It's a flight suit.

1001
01:13:43.591 --> 01:13:46.254
Designed to modulate my body temperature
and reduce drag.

1002
01:13:46.483 --> 01:13:48.378
Yeah, and yet you're still are one.

1003
01:13:48.794 --> 01:13:51.646
Good one, you are catching fire, Thomas.

1004
01:13:52.027 --> 01:13:54.932
Oh, and speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1005
01:13:55.075 --> 01:13:58.636
Does she have a name, or should
we just call her 'collateral damage'?

1006
01:13:58.845 --> 01:14:00.057
Hey, watch your mouth!

1007
01:14:00.201 --> 01:14:02.628
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier?

1008
01:14:02.752 --> 01:14:03.833
Punched him in a face.

1009
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:06.324
Oh, you punched him right in the face.
It was awesome.

1010
01:14:06.461 --> 01:14:09.360
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1011
01:14:09.493 --> 01:14:12.324
Your flying eggs are pretty impressive,
Mr. Eggman.

1012
01:14:12.556 --> 01:14:14.986
But let's face it, you'll never catch me.

1013
01:14:15.125 --> 01:14:16.652
Confidence,

1014
01:14:16.929 --> 01:14:19.218
a fool's substitute for intelligence.

1015
01:14:26.693 --> 01:14:28.373
That's not good.

1016
01:14:28.767 --> 01:14:31.966
Sonic, I know you got the super speed
and everything, but Maddie and I--

1017
01:14:32.089 --> 01:14:34.236
Totally defenseless,
probably gonna get blown up?

1018
01:14:34.357 --> 01:14:35.680
Pretty much, yeah.

1019
01:14:36.235 --> 01:14:38.959
Don't worry, I know exactly what to do.

1020
01:14:46.155 --> 01:14:48.137
I was not expecting that.

1021
01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:51.558
But I was expecting not to expect
something, so it doesn't count.

1022
01:15:51.916 --> 01:15:53.168
Come on!

1023
01:15:53.296 --> 01:15:55.492
Com-- Com--
Come on! Come on!

1024
01:16:21.964 --> 01:16:24.439
Hi Tom. Glad you're here.

1025
01:16:24.577 --> 01:16:27.789
Could use some help.
Old Bessie is about to give birth.

1026
01:16:28.455 --> 01:16:29.803
Give me a minute.

1027
01:16:32.515 --> 01:16:35.624
Can I give you one
genius piece of advice?

1028
01:16:36.215 --> 01:16:37.627
Don't run.

1029
01:16:37.767 --> 01:16:39.909
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1030
01:16:40.129 --> 01:16:42.505
And it's bad for your joints,
they proved it.

1031
01:16:42.648 --> 01:16:46.382
All right, Eggman, you wanna get fast?
Let's get fast.

1032
01:16:49.363 --> 01:16:51.284
The hard way it is.

1033
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:12.311
That was an illegal left, by the way.

1034
01:17:14.578 --> 01:17:16.400
<i>So, here we are again.</i>

1035
01:17:16.542 --> 01:17:18.268
<i>We've been through so much together.</i>

1036
01:17:18.385 --> 01:17:20.909
<i>Now you understand
why there's a psychotic robot-doctor</i>

1037
01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:23.271
<i>chasing a super sonic blue hedgehog.</i>

1038
01:17:23.357 --> 01:17:24.619
<i>Wanna know how it ends?</i>

1039
01:17:24.769 --> 01:17:26.223
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

1040
01:17:43.646 --> 01:17:47.054
How is this possible?! No one's ever
caught up to me before.

1041
01:17:54.829 --> 01:17:56.318
Coming through!

1042
01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:01.237
<i>Excusez-moi, monsieur.</i>

1043
01:18:05.159 --> 01:18:07.699
Here we go. Room to open it up.

1044
01:18:16.695 --> 01:18:18.207
I can't lose him!

1045
01:18:32.543 --> 01:18:35.119
If you can't beat him, blind him.

1046
01:18:38.117 --> 01:18:40.209
Lost visual contact.

1047
01:18:44.954 --> 01:18:47.001
You're not allowed up there!

1048
01:18:47.162 --> 01:18:49.298
It's one of the Seven Wonders.

1049
01:19:13.230 --> 01:19:15.517
-Get out of here!
-Go! Go!

1050
01:19:22.774 --> 01:19:25.799
You're an astonishing little creature.

1051
01:19:28.461 --> 01:19:30.463
It'll be funny to take you back to the lab

1052
01:19:30.619 --> 01:19:33.184
for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.

1053
01:19:33.826 --> 01:19:36.130
Any last words?

1054
01:19:36.327 --> 01:19:37.741
Guac.

1055
01:19:37.986 --> 01:19:39.627
I like that word.

1056
01:19:40.557 --> 01:19:43.026
I don't have to tell you
how many scientific breakthroughs

1057
01:19:43.159 --> 01:19:45.529
have been made possible
by animal testing.

1058
01:19:45.653 --> 01:19:47.004
You're being very selfish.

1059
01:19:47.145 --> 01:19:48.982
-Going my way?
-What a--

1060
01:19:54.575 --> 01:19:56.742
Who the hell do you think you are?!

1061
01:19:59.825 --> 01:20:01.813
I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a--

1062
01:20:06.407 --> 01:20:08.538
Autopilot, adjust.

1063
01:20:08.985 --> 01:20:10.146
Why?

1064
01:20:10.527 --> 01:20:13.717
Why would you throw
your life away for this <i>thing</i>?

1065
01:20:13.873 --> 01:20:15.416
That's why I don't have friends.

1066
01:20:15.574 --> 01:20:17.579
Next thing you know, you're
somebody's best man,

1067
01:20:17.726 --> 01:20:19.456
they wanna have
the wedding out of town.

1068
01:20:19.595 --> 01:20:21.679
Like nobody has
anything better to do!

1069
01:20:21.887 --> 01:20:23.911
Anyway, where were we?

1070
01:20:24.107 --> 01:20:25.217
Oh, yes,

1071
01:20:25.387 --> 01:20:27.124
you were about to die.

1072
01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:31.184
It's our Sheriff you're messing with.

1073
01:20:32.498 --> 01:20:34.177
Do you know Blue Devil?

1074
01:20:34.341 --> 01:20:37.371
Who everyone can see
is a very real creature,

1075
01:20:37.755 --> 01:20:40.724
and not at all invented by me!

1076
01:20:42.898 --> 01:20:44.868
-Be careful.
-Just-- pull it away--

1077
01:20:45.018 --> 01:20:46.207
Tom.

1078
01:20:59.506 --> 01:21:01.817
I don't mean to be indelicate here.

1079
01:21:02.183 --> 01:21:05.218
But someone should get some ice
to keep the body fresh.

1080
01:21:07.961 --> 01:21:10.610
He's just a silly little alien.

1081
01:21:10.846 --> 01:21:12.796
He didn't belong here!

1082
01:21:14.328 --> 01:21:15.898
That little alien

1083
01:21:16.527 --> 01:21:19.929
knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1084
01:21:20.726 --> 01:21:22.597
His name was Sonic.

1085
01:21:22.963 --> 01:21:24.775
This was his home.

1086
01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.251
And he was my friend.

1087
01:21:51.908 --> 01:21:53.544
He's all yours.

1088
01:21:54.810 --> 01:21:56.223
Everyone get back!

1089
01:21:59.713 --> 01:22:02.601
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1090
01:22:13.313 --> 01:22:15.224
This is my power!

1091
01:22:15.412 --> 01:22:17.825
And I'm not using it
to run away anymore.

1092
01:22:18.006 --> 01:22:21.271
I'm using it to protect my friends!

1093
01:23:19.802 --> 01:23:21.150
Now you've done it!

1094
01:23:21.315 --> 01:23:24.014
Guess what, Eggman,
I'm not leaving Earth.

1095
01:23:24.185 --> 01:23:25.554
You are!

1096
01:23:25.692 --> 01:23:27.043
Donut Lord?

1097
01:24:15.899 --> 01:24:18.655
-Told you you got this.
-Hey, we got this.

1098
01:24:31.279 --> 01:24:33.916
-These belong to you.
-Thank you very much.

1099
01:24:34.754 --> 01:24:36.778
No more pushing people off the buildings.

1100
01:24:36.943 --> 01:24:38.568
You know I can't promise that.

1101
01:24:41.646 --> 01:24:44.748
-You did pretty good, space hog.
-Thanks, Donut Lord.

1102
01:24:44.897 --> 01:24:47.724
You gonna have to explain
this 'Donut Lord' thing.

1103
01:24:47.879 --> 01:24:50.430
Nope, sorry, that's for me
and our little guy. Right?

1104
01:24:50.729 --> 01:24:52.874
We got our thing, you got
your thing with your...

1105
01:24:52.993 --> 01:24:54.611
-sister.
-Oh my God, my sister.

1106
01:24:54.778 --> 01:24:57.110
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1107
01:24:58.861 --> 01:25:00.920
Jojo, put on my Fitbit.

1108
01:25:01.716 --> 01:25:03.534
Then I'll at least get some steps.

1109
01:25:03.688 --> 01:25:05.517
We can never go back there.

1110
01:25:06.395 --> 01:25:07.927
I mean, are we?

1111
01:25:09.958 --> 01:25:12.335
'Cause it kinda feels like
we're home right now.

1112
01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.549
Really?

1113
01:25:15.719 --> 01:25:18.244
I kinda feel like I checked
the 'save the life'

1114
01:25:18.412 --> 01:25:20.263
box off my bucket list.

1115
01:25:22.696 --> 01:25:26.445
Now all I wanna do is to spend my life
with the people I care about.

1116
01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:29.970
I wanna check that box.

1117
01:25:30.423 --> 01:25:32.335
Okay. I like that.

1118
01:25:32.608 --> 01:25:35.166
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

1119
01:25:35.704 --> 01:25:38.373
Disperse. Just another
ordinary day in Green Hills.

1120
01:25:38.524 --> 01:25:40.347
Carl, I'll take that chainsaw.

1121
01:25:40.643 --> 01:25:42.429
Come on, let's go!

1122
01:25:42.621 --> 01:25:44.786
You act like you've never seen
a fight between

1123
01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:48.891
an intergalactic space rodent
and a robot with a doctorate.

1124
01:25:58.031 --> 01:25:59.493
You got enough there?

1125
01:25:59.762 --> 01:26:01.823
-Yes, Mr. Manager.
-You need any more?

1126
01:26:02.052 --> 01:26:03.375
Get that--

1127
01:26:14.041 --> 01:26:16.038
Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski?

1128
01:26:16.706 --> 01:26:18.049
Yes?

1129
01:26:20.103 --> 01:26:22.203
A token of appreciation
from your government.

1130
01:26:22.370 --> 01:26:25.668
For keeping quiet about recent
incidents, which never occurred.

1131
01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:29.009
Wow!

1132
01:26:29.389 --> 01:26:31.907
-Wonder what it is.
-Money to fix the house?

1133
01:26:32.072 --> 01:26:34.325
-Letter from the President?
-You'll see.

1134
01:26:34.767 --> 01:26:36.257
Okay.

1135
01:26:39.165 --> 01:26:41.377
-Olive Garden?
-Yeah.

1136
01:26:41.665 --> 01:26:43.203
The way you said "you'll see"

1137
01:26:43.367 --> 01:26:45.933
made me think it was something
better than the things we said.

1138
01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:48.289
Have you tried their
'Never Ending Pasta Bowl'?

1139
01:26:48.516 --> 01:26:50.146
It never ends.

1140
01:26:50.368 --> 01:26:52.094
That sounds fancy.

1141
01:26:52.300 --> 01:26:55.054
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1142
01:26:55.685 --> 01:26:58.825
Oh, hey, I guess we can close
the file on that Robotnik guy, huh?

1143
01:26:58.993 --> 01:27:00.381
Just disappeared?

1144
01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:04.417
I'm sorry, but, no such person exists,
or ever has existed.

1145
01:27:05.656 --> 01:27:06.846
I wish that was true.

1146
01:27:07.012 --> 01:27:08.870
You haven't by any chance been in contact

1147
01:27:09.013 --> 01:27:11.585
with a certain alien creature
since the incident, have you?

1148
01:27:11.757 --> 01:27:13.649
Uncle Sam would love
to have a chat with him.

1149
01:27:13.832 --> 01:27:16.211
Very casual, brunch perhaps.

1150
01:27:17.798 --> 01:27:20.825
Oh, you mean the little blue guy?
No, no. Nothing.

1151
01:27:21.832 --> 01:27:24.010
Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.

1152
01:27:25.375 --> 01:27:27.557
-Very well.
-Okay.

1153
01:27:28.052 --> 01:27:29.894
-Thank you.
-Great.

1154
01:27:32.124 --> 01:27:33.425
Yup.

1155
01:27:36.649 --> 01:27:39.347
To be honest, I'm pretty pumped
about the pasta bowl.

1156
01:27:39.871 --> 01:27:41.739
So, you guys wanna watch a movie or what?

1157
01:27:41.874 --> 01:27:45.119
Sorry, buddy, it's a school night,
it's time for you to go back to your cave.

1158
01:27:45.238 --> 01:27:46.848
What? It's three in the afternoon!

1159
01:27:46.982 --> 01:27:48.911
You know how you get
when you're tired, come on.

1160
01:27:49.034 --> 01:27:50.516
Me? I'm not like anything.

1161
01:27:50.656 --> 01:27:53.676
-You guys are so uncool.
-Yeah, yeah. We know.

1162
01:27:54.305 --> 01:27:57.601
-Hey, buddy, where are you going?
-You said I have to go back to my cave.

1163
01:27:57.737 --> 01:27:58.919
We did.

1164
01:28:14.493 --> 01:28:16.698
Oh my-- Are you kidding me?

1165
01:28:17.578 --> 01:28:19.222
I can't believe it.

1166
01:28:19.534 --> 01:28:20.770
How did you--

1167
01:28:21.467 --> 01:28:23.736
It-- This is-- It's all here.

1168
01:28:33.979 --> 01:28:37.058
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the bean bag? No way!

1169
01:28:37.824 --> 01:28:40.418
How did you even get this?
How did you get it all over?

1170
01:28:41.408 --> 01:28:43.291
I love it, I love it!

1171
01:28:46.838 --> 01:28:49.578
Well, welcome home.

1172
01:28:49.814 --> 01:28:52.291
Thank you so much.

1173
01:29:01.126 --> 01:29:02.606
Oh, no, you don't.

1174
01:29:02.772 --> 01:29:05.784
No second best animal friends
allowed in my room.

1175
01:29:06.283 --> 01:29:08.556
Wait, what are you doing?
Stay away from me.

1176
01:29:08.969 --> 01:29:11.663
Stop it. I'm warning you,
I've got nunchucks.

1177
01:29:11.842 --> 01:29:14.365
Hey, stop. Okay, you can stay.

1178
01:29:31.694 --> 01:29:35.042
My grasp on sanity remains absolute.

1179
01:29:36.839 --> 01:29:38.693
Isn't that right, Agent Stone?

1180
01:29:43.488 --> 01:29:45.805
Why don't you get a head start.

1181
01:29:47.722 --> 01:29:50.026
Do some rockconnaissance.

1182
01:29:50.943 --> 01:29:53.683
Rockconnaissance.
Come on, that's hilarious.

1183
01:29:53.840 --> 01:29:55.656
What's the matter with you?!

1184
01:29:55.972 --> 01:29:59.310
Here's the sitch. Uninhabited planet.

1185
01:30:00.659 --> 01:30:02.921
No resources. No supplies.

1186
01:30:03.185 --> 01:30:05.002
No apparent way home.

1187
01:30:07.086 --> 01:30:09.355
A lesser man would die here.

1188
01:30:11.923 --> 01:30:14.151
I'll be home by Christmas.

1189
01:30:33.087 --> 01:30:35.563
Rockconnaissance!

1190
01:30:38.384 --> 01:30:40.208
Come on, cheer up!

1191
01:30:40.529 --> 01:30:44.359
There is a post-credits scene
at 01:32:18! Stay tuned.

1193
01:32:42.339 --> 01:32:44.772
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

1194
01:32:44.935 --> 01:32:46.255
I found him!

1195
01:32:46.391 --> 01:32:48.170
I just hope I'm not too late.
