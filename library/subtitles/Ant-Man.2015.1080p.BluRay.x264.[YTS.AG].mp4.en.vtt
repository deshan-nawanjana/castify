00:00:19.621 --> 00:00:21.148
Stark!

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:22.661
He doesn't seem happy.

00:00:22.861 --> 00:00:24.228
Hello, Hank.

00:00:25.901 --> 00:00:27.421
You're supposed to be in Moscow.

00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:29.387
I took a detour...

00:00:30.461 --> 00:00:32.591
Through your defense lab.

00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:35.541
Tell me that isn't what
I think it is.

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:39.661
That depends if you think it's
a poor attempt to replicate my work.

00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:43.021
Even for this group,
that takes nerve.

00:00:43.221 --> 00:00:44.621
You were instructed to go to Russia.

00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:46.701
May I remind you, Dr. Pym,
that you're a soldier...

00:00:46.901 --> 00:00:47.901
I'm a scientist.

00:00:48.101 --> 00:00:49.621
Then act like one.

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.261
The Pym Particle is the most
revolutionary science ever developed.

00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:53.461
Help us put it to good use.

00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:55.941
I let you turn me into your errand boy,

00:00:56.141 --> 00:00:57.941
and now you try to steal my research?

00:00:58.141 --> 00:01:02.467
If only you'd protected Janet
with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.

00:01:04.941 --> 00:01:06.069
Ah...

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:09.151
Easy, Hank.

00:01:10.501 --> 00:01:13.021
You mention my wife again

00:01:13.221 --> 00:01:15.141
and I'll show you ferocity.

00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:16.947
Don't look at me. You said it.

00:01:18.021 --> 00:01:20.221
I formally tender my resignation.

00:01:20.421 --> 00:01:22.621
We don't accept it. Formally.

00:01:22.821 --> 00:01:23.981
Hank,

00:01:24.181 --> 00:01:25.781
we need you.

00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.181
The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please.

00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.581
Don't let your past determine the future.

00:01:30.781 --> 00:01:33.581
As long as I am alive,

00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:37.265
nobody will ever get that formula.

00:01:43.941 --> 00:01:45.821
We shouldn't let him leave the building.

00:01:46.021 --> 00:01:48.101
You've already lied to him.
Now you want to go to war with him?

00:01:48.301 --> 00:01:49.701
Yes.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:52.821
Our scientists haven't come close
to replicating his work.

00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:54.941
He just kicked your ass, full-size.

00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:58.023
You really want to find out what it's like
when you can't see him coming?

00:01:58.741 --> 00:02:00.181
I've known Hank Pym for a long time.

00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:01.873
He's no security risk.

00:02:04.101 --> 00:02:05.787
Unless we make him one.

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:45.789
You like that?

00:02:46.141 --> 00:02:47.141
You like that?

00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:48.788
Come get you some now.

00:03:00.421 --> 00:03:01.549
You didn't even move.

00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:02.941
Nah.

00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:05.261
What if I come in on the left side, right?
Just down here.

00:03:05.461 --> 00:03:06.464
You see this right here?

00:03:15.141 --> 00:03:16.661
I'm gonna miss you, Scott.

00:03:16.861 --> 00:03:18.706
I'm gonna miss you, too, Peachy.

00:03:20.221 --> 00:03:22.421
Man, you guys got
the weirdest goodbye rituals.

00:03:22.621 --> 00:03:24.461
All right, break it up.

00:03:24.661 --> 00:03:26.984
Break it up! Break it up!

00:03:44.101 --> 00:03:45.261
Scotty!

00:03:45.461 --> 00:03:47.101
What's up, man!

00:03:47.301 --> 00:03:48.621
Damn! Hey.

00:03:48.821 --> 00:03:51.110
Ha-ha! Hey, man.

00:03:52.901 --> 00:03:54.141
Hey, what's up with your eye?

00:03:54.341 --> 00:03:57.301
Oh. Well, what do you think? Peachy.
It's a going-away present.

00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:59.261
Oh, yeah.
I still got my scar from a year ago.

00:03:59.461 --> 00:04:01.431
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:04.501
You know what? I'm still the only one
who knocked him out.

00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:06.865
Well, I definitely didn't.

00:04:07.581 --> 00:04:08.821
Thanks for picking me up, brother.

00:04:09.021 --> 00:04:11.381
Bro, you think I'm gonna miss
my celly getting out?

00:04:11.581 --> 00:04:12.781
Hey, how's your girl, man?

00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:14.144
Oh, she left me.

00:04:14.501 --> 00:04:17.074
- Oh.
- Yeah, my ma died, too.

00:04:18.021 --> 00:04:19.388
And my dad got deported.

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:21.901
But I got the van!

00:04:22.101 --> 00:04:23.628
- It's nice.
- Yeah, right?

00:04:24.141 --> 00:04:26.381
Thanks for the hook-up, too.
I needed a place to stay.

00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:28.741
You wait till you see this couch.
You're gonna be really happy.

00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:30.301
You're gonna be on your feet
in no time. Watch.

00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:31.821
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

00:04:32.021 --> 00:04:34.501
And I gotta introduce you to some
people. Some really skilled people.

00:04:34.701 --> 00:04:36.221
- Not interested.
- Yeah, right.

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:38.744
No, I'm serious, man.
I'm not going back.

00:04:40.701 --> 00:04:42.181
I got a daughter to take care of.

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:44.461
You know that jobs don't come easy
for ex-cons, right?

00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:47.587
Look, man, I got a master's
in electrical engineering, all right?

00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:49.504
I'm gonna be fine.

00:04:52.901 --> 00:04:54.021
Welcome to Baskin-Robbins.

00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:56.101
Would you like to try our
Mango Fruit Blast?

00:04:56.301 --> 00:04:57.304
Uh, no, thanks.

00:04:57.701 --> 00:05:00.701
Um, I will have...
I'll have a burger, please.

00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.341
Oh, we don't... We don't make that.

00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.341
Pretzel. Hot pretzel. Like, mustard...
Do you have mustard dip?

00:05:06.541 --> 00:05:08.432
It's ice cream.
Baskin-Robbins.

00:05:09.741 --> 00:05:11.950
I'll just do, like,
whatever's hot and fresh.

00:05:12.621 --> 00:05:13.501
Dude.

00:05:13.701 --> 00:05:15.381
Can I see you in the back, chief?
Pronto.

00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:17.187
Sure thing, Dale.

00:05:18.141 --> 00:05:21.033
Darby, could you just, uh,
take care of this idiot? Thanks.

00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:25.992
- Hey, Dale.
- Come on in.

00:05:26.461 --> 00:05:27.749
Pull up some chair.

00:05:30.261 --> 00:05:32.301
Three years at San Quentin, huh?

00:05:32.501 --> 00:05:33.581
You found out.

00:05:33.781 --> 00:05:35.901
Baskin-Robbins always finds out.

00:05:36.101 --> 00:05:38.470
Look, I'm sorry, all right?
But I...

00:05:38.981 --> 00:05:40.061
No one would hire me.

00:05:40.261 --> 00:05:42.581
Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.

00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:44.821
Look, I'm sorry.

00:05:45.021 --> 00:05:46.381
I don't do it anymore. I just...

00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:47.584
Respect.

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:49.741
I couldn't be happier about it.

00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:51.261
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:53.261
Thank you. Thank you.

00:05:53.461 --> 00:05:55.901
You really stuck it
to those billionaire SOBs.

00:05:56.101 --> 00:05:58.501
The more I read about
what you did and stuff...

00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:01.101
I'm like, "Wow, I know this guy?

00:06:01.301 --> 00:06:03.261
"I'm in charge of this guy?"

00:06:03.461 --> 00:06:05.741
Well, I'm very happy in this job,

00:06:05.941 --> 00:06:08.101
and I really just appreciate
the opportunity to...

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.748
Well, you're fired, of course.

00:06:12.181 --> 00:06:13.421
I can't really keep you on.

00:06:13.621 --> 00:06:15.181
Wait, what? Fired?

00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:16.341
Yeah.

00:06:16.541 --> 00:06:18.461
Dale, look, it wasn't a violent crime.
I mean, I'm a good worker.

00:06:18.661 --> 00:06:21.421
No, it wasn't a violent crime.
It was a cool crime.

00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:22.781
I'll tell you what, though.

00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:26.021
This will be totally off the books,
off the records,

00:06:26.221 --> 00:06:29.101
but if you want to grab one of those
Mango Fruit Blasts

00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:30.501
on your way out the door,

00:06:30.701 --> 00:06:33.149
I'll just pretend I didn't see it.

00:07:11.701 --> 00:07:13.034
Hey, Scotty. What's up?

00:07:13.581 --> 00:07:15.181
I thought you were
supposed to be at work.

00:07:15.381 --> 00:07:17.101
I was. I got fired.

00:07:17.301 --> 00:07:18.901
Damn. They find out who you are?

00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:20.021
Yeah.

00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:21.821
Baskin-Robbins
always finds out, bro.

00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:23.861
Baskin-Robbins don't play.

00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:27.181
- You want some waffles?
- Yeah, I'll take a waffle.

00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.661
Oh. That's Kurt.

00:07:28.861 --> 00:07:31.183
He was Folsom for five years.
He's a wizard on that laptop.

00:07:32.141 --> 00:07:34.544
- Nice meet you.
- Yeah. Nice to meet you, too.

00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:36.470
Who are you?

00:07:36.901 --> 00:07:37.904
Dave.

00:07:39.221 --> 00:07:40.793
Nice work on the Vista job.

00:07:41.741 --> 00:07:42.901
Vista job, yes.

00:07:43.101 --> 00:07:45.461
No, no. I have heard of this robbery.

00:07:45.661 --> 00:07:48.901
Well, technically, I didn't rob them.
Robbery involves threat.

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:51.701
I hate violence. I burgled them.
I'm a cat burglar.

00:07:51.901 --> 00:07:53.221
You mean you're a pussy.

00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:54.381
Yeah.

00:07:54.581 --> 00:07:56.301
They were overcharging
the customers, right?

00:07:56.501 --> 00:07:57.821
And it added up to millions.

00:07:58.021 --> 00:07:59.912
He blows the whistle and he gets fired.

00:08:00.461 --> 00:08:01.621
And what does he do?

00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:03.621
He hacks into the security system

00:08:03.821 --> 00:08:06.381
and transfers millions
back to the people that they stole it from.

00:08:06.581 --> 00:08:08.381
Posts all the bank records online.

00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:10.743
And he drove the dude's Bentley
into his swimming pool.

00:08:13.421 --> 00:08:15.101
What are you doing?

00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:16.350
Hmm?

00:08:17.181 --> 00:08:19.301
Why are you telling my life story
to these guys?

00:08:19.501 --> 00:08:20.661
What do you want?

00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:21.741
Okay.

00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:24.221
My cousin talked to this guy
two weeks ago

00:08:24.421 --> 00:08:26.581
- about this little perfect job.
- No way.

00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:29.061
No, no, no. Wait!
This guy... This guy fits your M.O.

00:08:29.261 --> 00:08:30.101
No!

00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:32.501
I'm finished, man.
I'm not going back to jail.

00:08:32.701 --> 00:08:34.621
It's some retired millionaire
living off his golden parachute.

00:08:34.821 --> 00:08:36.661
It's a perfect Scott Lang mark!

00:08:36.861 --> 00:08:38.945
I don't care. I'm out.

00:08:57.701 --> 00:08:58.901
Dr. Pym?

00:08:59.101 --> 00:09:01.504
Yes. I'm still alive.

00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.630
ID?

00:09:11.181 --> 00:09:13.151
Perhaps that will suffice.

00:09:15.301 --> 00:09:17.385
Very sorry, sir. Please come in.

00:09:19.701 --> 00:09:21.671
Is that Hank Pym?

00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:27.029
Good morning, Hank.

00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:29.181
Hope.

00:09:29.381 --> 00:09:31.863
Would it kill you to call me Dad?

00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:35.707
Dr. Cross will be so pleased that
you could find the time to join us today.

00:09:36.221 --> 00:09:38.191
More like "thrilled."

00:09:38.981 --> 00:09:42.661
I was surprised to receive
any kind of invitation from you, Darren.

00:09:42.861 --> 00:09:44.141
What's the occasion?

00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:46.232
Oh, you'll see. Won't he, Hope?

00:09:50.741 --> 00:09:52.427
We're ready for you inside.

00:09:53.461 --> 00:09:54.624
Ouch.

00:09:55.701 --> 00:09:59.021
I guess some old wounds
never heal, huh?

00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:00.907
Don't worry, she's in good hands.

00:10:02.701 --> 00:10:04.865
You're in for a treat.

00:10:07.381 --> 00:10:11.308
Long time, no see, Dr. Pym.
How's retirement?

00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:13.547
How's your face?

00:10:16.541 --> 00:10:18.352
After you.

00:10:25.941 --> 00:10:29.021
Now, before we start,
I'd like to introduce a very special guest.

00:10:29.221 --> 00:10:31.590
This company's founder and my mentor,

00:10:32.261 --> 00:10:33.264
Dr. Hank Pym.

00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:50.741
When I took over this company
for Dr. Pym,

00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:53.061
I immediately started
researching a particle

00:10:53.261 --> 00:10:55.901
that could change
the distance between atoms,

00:10:56.101 --> 00:10:58.947
while increasing density and strength.

00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:02.381
Why this revolutionary idea
remained buried

00:11:02.581 --> 00:11:06.741
beneath the dust and cobwebs of
Hank's research, I couldn't tell you.

00:11:06.941 --> 00:11:08.741
But just imagine,

00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:13.187
a soldier the size of an insect.

00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:18.193
The ultimate secret weapon.

00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:32.185
An Ant-Man.

00:11:33.541 --> 00:11:35.511
That's what they called you.
Right, Hank?

00:11:39.861 --> 00:11:41.181
Silly, I know.

00:11:41.381 --> 00:11:42.873
Propaganda.

00:11:43.301 --> 00:11:45.032
Tales to astonish!

00:11:46.501 --> 00:11:48.341
Trumped-up BS to scare the USSR.

00:11:48.541 --> 00:11:52.261
Hank, will you tell our guests
what you told me

00:11:52.461 --> 00:11:55.990
every single time I asked you,

00:11:57.581 --> 00:11:59.941
"Was the Ant-Man real?"

00:12:00.141 --> 00:12:01.661
Just a tall tale.

00:12:01.861 --> 00:12:02.781
Right.

00:12:02.981 --> 00:12:06.066
Because how could anything
so miraculous possibly be real?

00:12:16.501 --> 00:12:19.981
Well, I was inspired by the legend
of the Ant-Man.

00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:22.901
And with my breakthrough
shrinking inorganic material,

00:12:23.101 --> 00:12:26.152
I thought, could it be possible
to shrink a person?

00:12:27.021 --> 00:12:28.627
Could that be done?

00:12:29.541 --> 00:12:33.434
Well, it's not a legend anymore.

00:12:35.061 --> 00:12:36.783
Distinguished guests,

00:12:37.141 --> 00:12:40.821
I am proud to present
the end of warfare as we know it.

00:12:41.021 --> 00:12:42.832
The Yellowjacket!

00:12:48.821 --> 00:12:49.821
Oh, no.

00:12:50.021 --> 00:12:53.345
The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose
weapon of war

00:12:53.861 --> 00:12:56.301
capable of altering the size of the wearer

00:12:56.501 --> 00:12:58.585
for the ultimate combat advantage.

00:12:59.261 --> 00:13:00.541
<i>We live in an era</i>

00:13:00.741 --> 00:13:02.861
<i>in which the weapons
we use to protect ourselves</i>

00:13:03.061 --> 00:13:06.021
<i>are undermined
by constant surveillance.</i>

00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:07.952
<i>It's time to return to a simpler age.</i>

00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.741
<i>One where the powers of freedom
can once again operate openly</i>

00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:13.229
<i>to protect their interests.</i>

00:13:13.981 --> 00:13:16.021
<i>An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel,</i>

00:13:16.221 --> 00:13:18.461
<i>The Yellowjacket
can manage any conflict</i>

00:13:18.661 --> 00:13:19.901
<i>on the geopolitical landscape</i>

00:13:20.101 --> 00:13:22.061
<i>completely unseen.</i>

00:13:22.261 --> 00:13:26.188
<i>Efficient in both preventative measures
and tactical assault.</i>

00:13:26.901 --> 00:13:29.381
<i>Practical applications
include surveillance,</i>

00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:31.267
<i>industrial sabotage,</i>

00:13:32.061 --> 00:13:36.341
<i>and the elimination of obstructions
on the road to peace.</i>

00:13:36.541 --> 00:13:37.661
<i>A single Yellowjacket</i>

00:13:37.861 --> 00:13:41.584
<i>offers the user unlimited influence
to carry out protective actions.</i>

00:13:42.461 --> 00:13:45.061
<i>And, one day soon,
an army of Yellowjackets</i>

00:13:45.261 --> 00:13:50.341
<i>will create a sustainable environment
of well-being around the world.</i>

00:13:50.541 --> 00:13:52.432
<i>The Yellowjacket.</i>

00:13:53.301 --> 00:13:54.873
So, it's a suit?

00:13:58.301 --> 00:13:59.901
Don't be crude, Frank.

00:14:00.101 --> 00:14:03.232
It's not a suit, it's a vessel.

00:14:03.861 --> 00:14:05.061
What's the matter?
You're not impressed?

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.021
No, I'm impressed. I'm also concerned.

00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:11.101
Imagine what our enemies
could do with this tech.

00:14:11.301 --> 00:14:13.741
We should have a longer conversation
about that, Frank.

00:14:13.941 --> 00:14:15.707
I really value your opinion.

00:14:16.621 --> 00:14:18.227
Thank you for coming. Hope?

00:14:19.101 --> 00:14:21.541
Thank you very much, everybody.
I will escort you out now.

00:14:21.741 --> 00:14:22.869
Thank you.

00:14:26.181 --> 00:14:27.581
You seem a bit shocked.

00:14:27.781 --> 00:14:31.941
Darren, there's a reason
that I buried these secrets.

00:14:32.141 --> 00:14:34.145
So you finally admit it!

00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:38.430
We could have done this together, Hank.
But you ruined that.

00:14:39.261 --> 00:14:40.581
That's why you're the past
and I'm the future.

00:14:40.781 --> 00:14:43.229
Don't do this.

00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:45.467
Dr. Cross?

00:14:46.701 --> 00:14:49.341
You sell to me first,
20% over your asking price,

00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:51.301
I can have the cash here in two weeks.

00:14:51.501 --> 00:14:52.709
Deal.

00:15:01.381 --> 00:15:03.461
We have to
make our move, Hank.

00:15:03.661 --> 00:15:04.581
How close is he?

00:15:04.781 --> 00:15:07.341
He still can't shrink a live subject.

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:09.981
Just give me the suit and let me
finish this once and for all.

00:15:10.181 --> 00:15:11.184
No.

00:15:11.501 --> 00:15:13.181
I have Cross' complete trust.

00:15:13.381 --> 00:15:15.545
- It's too dangerous.
- We don't have a choice.

00:15:16.101 --> 00:15:18.185
Well, that's not entirely true.

00:15:20.181 --> 00:15:22.026
I think I found a guy.

00:15:23.501 --> 00:15:24.868
Who?

00:15:29.181 --> 00:15:30.541
Daddy!

00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:32.141
Peanut! Oh!

00:15:32.341 --> 00:15:34.381
Happy birthday!

00:15:34.581 --> 00:15:35.461
I'm so sorry I'm late.

00:15:35.661 --> 00:15:37.141
I didn't know
what time your party started.

00:15:37.341 --> 00:15:38.701
It was on the invitation.

00:15:38.901 --> 00:15:40.541
He didn't get an invitation.

00:15:40.741 --> 00:15:42.141
But he came anyway!

00:15:42.341 --> 00:15:45.181
Well, I'm not gonna miss
my little girl's birthday party.

00:15:45.381 --> 00:15:47.021
I'm gonna go tell Mommy you're here.

00:15:47.221 --> 00:15:48.101
Oh, you don't...

00:15:48.301 --> 00:15:49.181
What are you doing here, Lang?

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:50.781
You haven't paid a dime of child support.

00:15:50.981 --> 00:15:52.541
You know, right now, if I wanted to,
I could arrest you.

00:15:52.741 --> 00:15:53.701
It's good to see you too, Paxton.

00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:57.225
Mommy's so happy you're here,
she choked on her drink.

00:15:58.741 --> 00:16:01.341
Hey, look what I have for you.

00:16:01.541 --> 00:16:02.821
Can I open it now?

00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:04.752
Of course, sweetheart.
It's your birthday.

00:16:09.061 --> 00:16:10.581
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

00:16:10.781 --> 00:16:11.821
What is that thing?

00:16:12.021 --> 00:16:13.752
He's so ugly!

00:16:14.221 --> 00:16:16.181
I love him!

00:16:16.381 --> 00:16:17.781
Can I go show my friends?

00:16:17.981 --> 00:16:19.906
Of course, sweetheart. Go ahead.

00:16:20.581 --> 00:16:22.061
<i>You're my bestest friend.</i>

00:16:22.261 --> 00:16:24.261
Look, the child support
is coming, all right?

00:16:24.461 --> 00:16:26.341
It's just hard finding a job
when you have a record.

00:16:26.541 --> 00:16:29.181
I'm sure you'll figure it out.
But for now, I want you out of my house.

00:16:29.381 --> 00:16:30.781
- No way! It's my daughter's birthday.
- It's my house!

00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:32.543
- So what? It's my kid!
- Scott!

00:16:33.541 --> 00:16:35.781
You can't just show up here.
You know that. Come on.

00:16:35.981 --> 00:16:36.901
It's a birthday party.

00:16:37.101 --> 00:16:38.661
Yeah, I know, but you can't just show up.

00:16:38.861 --> 00:16:39.741
She's my daughter.

00:16:39.941 --> 00:16:41.221
You don't know the first thing
about being a father.

00:16:41.421 --> 00:16:45.421
Maggie, I tell you this as a friend,
and as the first love of my life.

00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:47.421
Your fiancé is an asshat.

00:16:47.621 --> 00:16:48.581
He's not an asshat.

00:16:48.781 --> 00:16:51.541
- Hey, watch your language. Okay?
- What language? I said "hat."

00:16:51.741 --> 00:16:53.108
Stop it.

00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:56.301
Really, Maggie? That guy?

00:16:56.501 --> 00:16:57.981
Come on!
You could marry anyone you want,

00:16:58.181 --> 00:16:59.421
and you have to get engaged to a cop?

00:16:59.621 --> 00:17:01.273
At least he's not a crook.

00:17:03.021 --> 00:17:05.741
I'm trying, okay? I've changed.
I'm straight.

00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:08.310
I had a job and...

00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:10.781
I wanna provide.

00:17:10.981 --> 00:17:13.381
I had a lot of time to think about it
and I love her.

00:17:13.581 --> 00:17:14.461
So much.

00:17:14.661 --> 00:17:17.861
I've missed so much time
and I wanna be a part of her life.

00:17:18.061 --> 00:17:19.064
What do I do?

00:17:19.861 --> 00:17:21.149
Get an apartment,

00:17:21.661 --> 00:17:23.981
get a job, pay child support.

00:17:24.181 --> 00:17:27.392
And then we will talk about visitation,
I promise.

00:17:27.941 --> 00:17:29.911
You're her hero, Scott.

00:17:30.861 --> 00:17:35.073
Just be the person
that she already thinks you are.

00:17:58.781 --> 00:18:01.673
I'm sorry you have such deep concerns
about the Yellowjacket, Frank.

00:18:02.301 --> 00:18:04.141
Yeah. Well, uh...

00:18:04.341 --> 00:18:08.826
Unfortunately, we can't just do
whatever we want.

00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:11.107
It'd be nice though, right?

00:18:12.541 --> 00:18:13.590
But there are laws.

00:18:14.181 --> 00:18:15.581
What laws? Of man?

00:18:15.781 --> 00:18:18.101
The laws of nature
transcend the laws of man.

00:18:18.301 --> 00:18:20.465
And I've transcended the laws of nature.

00:18:23.741 --> 00:18:26.826
Darren, I don't think you understand...

00:18:29.661 --> 00:18:30.824
Hmm.

00:18:32.901 --> 00:18:35.383
We still haven't worked out all the bugs.

00:18:40.621 --> 00:18:41.954
Goodbye, Frank.

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:57.107
Thank you.

00:19:01.221 --> 00:19:03.861
You know, I've been thinking a lot
about gratitude lately.

00:19:04.061 --> 00:19:06.301
And today,
during my morning meditation,

00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:09.301
an interesting thought occurred to me,
and I think it might apply to you, too.

00:19:09.501 --> 00:19:10.661
How's that?

00:19:10.861 --> 00:19:12.672
Gratitude can be forgiveness.

00:19:14.061 --> 00:19:17.541
I've spent years carrying around
my anger for Hank Pym.

00:19:17.741 --> 00:19:20.221
I devoted my genius to him.

00:19:20.421 --> 00:19:22.266
I could have worked anywhere.

00:19:22.941 --> 00:19:24.593
I chose my mentor poorly.

00:19:25.421 --> 00:19:27.232
You didn't even have a choice.

00:19:27.941 --> 00:19:30.230
He never believed in you.

00:19:31.141 --> 00:19:35.865
It's a shame what we had to do,
but he forced us to do it, didn't he?

00:19:36.261 --> 00:19:39.267
But we shouldn't be angry,
we should be grateful.

00:19:40.021 --> 00:19:42.781
Because his failures as a mentor,

00:19:42.981 --> 00:19:45.111
as a father,

00:19:45.701 --> 00:19:48.786
forced us to spread our wings.

00:19:51.461 --> 00:19:53.545
You're a success, Darren.

00:19:54.381 --> 00:19:56.704
You deserve everything
coming your way.

00:20:16.821 --> 00:20:17.821
Ooh.

00:20:18.021 --> 00:20:19.673
Stop cheating.

00:20:20.501 --> 00:20:21.993
Hey, what's up, hotshot?

00:20:23.381 --> 00:20:25.141
Maybe he didn't hear you.

00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:26.344
How was the party?

00:20:33.181 --> 00:20:35.541
- Tell me about that tip.
- What?

00:20:35.741 --> 00:20:37.581
I wanna know about that tip.

00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:40.301
Oh, baby, it's on! It's so on, right now.

00:20:40.501 --> 00:20:42.781
Calm down, all right?
I just need to know where it came from.

00:20:42.981 --> 00:20:44.269
It's gotta be airtight.

00:20:44.981 --> 00:20:46.021
Okay.

00:20:46.221 --> 00:20:48.341
I was at a wine tasting
with my cousin Ernesto.

00:20:48.541 --> 00:20:50.741
Which was mainly reds,
and you know I don't like reds, man.

00:20:50.941 --> 00:20:53.141
But there was a rosé that saved the day.
It was delightful.

00:20:53.341 --> 00:20:55.821
<i>And then he tells me about this girl,
Emily, that we used to kick it with.</i>

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:58.101
<i>It was actually the first pair of boobs
I ever touched.</i>

00:20:58.301 --> 00:20:59.821
It's the wrong details.

00:21:00.021 --> 00:21:01.261
It has nothing to do with the story.

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:02.464
Go.

00:21:03.301 --> 00:21:06.821
<i>So, uh, he tells me that she's
working as a housekeeper now, right?</i>

00:21:07.021 --> 00:21:10.221
<i>And she's dating this dude, Carlos,
who's a shot caller from across the bay.</i>

00:21:10.421 --> 00:21:13.381
<i>And she tells him about the dude
that she's cleaning for.</i>

00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:15.821
<i>Right? That he's like this big-shot CEO</i>

00:21:16.021 --> 00:21:17.981
<i>That is all retired now, but he's loaded.</i>

00:21:18.181 --> 00:21:21.821
<i>And so, Carlos and Ernesto
are on the same softball team,</i>

00:21:22.021 --> 00:21:23.501
<i>and they get to talking, right?</i>

00:21:23.701 --> 00:21:27.021
<i>And here comes the good part.
Carlos says, "Yo, man.</i>

00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:31.181
<i>"This guy's got a big-ass safe just
sitting in the basement, just chilling."</i>

00:21:31.381 --> 00:21:33.741
Of course Ernesto comes to me because
he knows I got mad thieving skills.

00:21:33.941 --> 00:21:34.821
<i>Of course, I ask him...</i>

00:21:35.021 --> 00:21:38.221
<i>"Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you
to get to me what kind of safe it was?"</i>

00:21:38.421 --> 00:21:39.541
<i>And he says, "Nah, dawg.</i>

00:21:39.741 --> 00:21:41.821
<i>"All she said is that it's super-legit</i>

00:21:42.021 --> 00:21:44.185
<i>"and whatever's in it, it's gotta be good."</i>

00:21:47.221 --> 00:21:48.061
What?

00:21:48.261 --> 00:21:50.661
Old man have safe.

00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:52.821
And he's gone for a week.

00:21:53.021 --> 00:21:54.861
All right.
There's an old man, he's got a safe,

00:21:55.061 --> 00:21:56.061
and he's gone for a week.

00:21:56.261 --> 00:21:57.221
Let's just work with that.

00:21:57.421 --> 00:21:58.868
You know what I'm saying?

00:22:47.981 --> 00:22:50.741
Landline's cut, cell signal's jammed.

00:22:50.941 --> 00:22:53.101
No one will be making
for distress call tonight.

00:22:53.301 --> 00:22:54.181
Comm check.

00:22:54.381 --> 00:22:55.381
- Check.
- Check.

00:22:55.581 --> 00:22:57.661
Hey, if the job goes bad,
you know I got your back, right?

00:22:57.861 --> 00:22:58.981
Don't worry.

00:22:59.181 --> 00:23:01.390
It's not gonna happen.

00:23:03.861 --> 00:23:05.627
I love it when he gets cocky.

00:23:11.661 --> 00:23:12.744
Damn!

00:23:40.541 --> 00:23:41.461
Alarm is dead.

00:23:41.661 --> 00:23:42.710
Nice.

00:23:45.021 --> 00:23:47.344
<i>All right,
I'm moving through the house.</i>

00:24:12.541 --> 00:24:14.301
There's a fingerprint lock on the door.

00:24:14.501 --> 00:24:16.981
It's got what?
Ernesto didn't tell me nothing about that.

00:24:17.181 --> 00:24:19.141
<i>Aw, man, are we screwed?</i>

00:24:19.341 --> 00:24:21.266
Not necessarily.

00:25:09.261 --> 00:25:10.221
I'm in.

00:25:10.421 --> 00:25:13.632
No alarms have been triggered.
He's in like the Flynn.

00:25:17.461 --> 00:25:19.141
Oh, man.

00:25:19.341 --> 00:25:20.674
<i>What is it?</i>

00:25:21.301 --> 00:25:23.901
Well, they weren't kidding.
This safe is serious.

00:25:24.101 --> 00:25:26.221
<i>How serious
are we talking, Scotty?</i>

00:25:26.421 --> 00:25:27.981
It's a Carbondale.

00:25:28.181 --> 00:25:29.461
It's from 1910.

00:25:29.661 --> 00:25:32.301
Made from the same steel as the Titanic.

00:25:32.501 --> 00:25:33.621
Wow.

00:25:33.821 --> 00:25:35.101
Can you crack it?

00:25:35.301 --> 00:25:38.621
Well, here's the thing.
It doesn't do so well in the cold.

00:25:38.821 --> 00:25:39.981
Remember what that iceberg did?

00:25:40.181 --> 00:25:41.781
Yeah, man. It killed DiCaprio.

00:25:41.981 --> 00:25:42.861
Killed everybody.

00:25:43.061 --> 00:25:44.501
Did not kill the Old lady.

00:25:44.701 --> 00:25:46.865
She still throw the jewel into the oceans.

00:26:39.141 --> 00:26:40.501
<i>What are you doing?</i>

00:26:40.701 --> 00:26:43.343
I poured water in the locking mechanism
and froze it with nitrogen.

00:26:43.901 --> 00:26:46.224
Ice expands. Metal doesn't.

00:26:46.701 --> 00:26:48.705
<i>- What are you doing now?</i>
- Waiting.

00:26:50.301 --> 00:26:51.304
Waiting.

00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:00.544
Nice.

00:27:04.781 --> 00:27:06.433
<i>What is it? Cash? Jewels?</i>

00:27:07.701 --> 00:27:09.546
- There's nothing here.
- What did you say?

00:27:11.261 --> 00:27:13.072
- It's a suit.
- What?

00:27:13.701 --> 00:27:15.592
It's an old motorcycle suit.

00:27:16.621 --> 00:27:18.381
There's no cash, no jewelry, nothing?

00:27:18.581 --> 00:27:20.028
No.

00:27:20.901 --> 00:27:21.741
It's a bust.

00:27:21.941 --> 00:27:24.341
I'm really sorry, Scotty.

00:27:24.541 --> 00:27:26.307
I know you needed to score.

00:28:01.101 --> 00:28:02.434
I thought we were using mice.

00:28:03.261 --> 00:28:04.424
What's the difference?

00:28:05.781 --> 00:28:10.541
Commence Experiment 34-C.
Organic atomic reduction.

00:28:10.741 --> 00:28:12.421
Darren, maybe we should think...

00:28:12.621 --> 00:28:14.981
Shrinking organic tissue
is the centerpiece of this technology.

00:28:15.181 --> 00:28:17.185
I can't go to the buyers
with half a breakthrough.

00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:45.821
Experiment 34-C results,

00:28:46.021 --> 00:28:47.070
negative.

00:28:51.461 --> 00:28:55.024
Sanitize the work station.
Bring in subject 35-C.

00:29:06.261 --> 00:29:07.833
Why would you lock this up?

00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:31.784
This is so weird.

00:30:03.741 --> 00:30:05.154
Scotty, what's up, man?

00:30:10.421 --> 00:30:12.790
I wonder... What is this?

00:30:43.141 --> 00:30:46.581
<i>The world sure seems different
from down here, doesn't it, Scott?</i>

00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:49.184
What? Who said that?

00:30:54.621 --> 00:30:56.512
Luis, down here!

00:30:57.221 --> 00:31:00.821
<i>It's a trial by fire, Scott.
Or, in this case,</i>

00:31:01.021 --> 00:31:02.070
<i>water.</i>

00:31:26.541 --> 00:31:28.830
<i>Guess you're tougher
than you thought.</i>

00:31:31.461 --> 00:31:32.988
Oh, I don't want to see this!

00:31:33.661 --> 00:31:34.903
Luis!

00:31:39.821 --> 00:31:40.870
Son of a...

00:32:57.981 --> 00:32:59.394
What the hell?

00:33:00.461 --> 00:33:02.821
<i>Not bad for a test drive.</i>

00:33:03.021 --> 00:33:05.021
<i>Keep the suit. I'll be in touch.</i>

00:33:05.221 --> 00:33:07.271
No! No! No, thank you!

00:33:19.421 --> 00:33:21.421
Get down on the ground!

00:33:21.621 --> 00:33:22.901
You are under arrest!

00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:25.781
No, I didn't steal anything!
I was returning something I stole.

00:33:25.981 --> 00:33:26.984
Oh...

00:33:29.301 --> 00:33:30.953
Don't move.

00:33:34.941 --> 00:33:36.101
<i>You know,
you almost had us convinced</i>

00:33:36.301 --> 00:33:38.431
that you were gonna change your ways.

00:33:38.981 --> 00:33:41.145
They were really rooting for you.

00:33:42.781 --> 00:33:44.785
It's gonna break their hearts.

00:33:47.541 --> 00:33:49.944
- You got a visitor.
- Who?

00:33:50.381 --> 00:33:51.384
Your lawyer.

00:33:52.181 --> 00:33:53.514
My lawyer?

00:33:56.621 --> 00:33:59.069
I told you I'd be in touch, Scott.

00:33:59.861 --> 00:34:03.549
I'm starting to think that
you prefer the inside of a jail cell.

00:34:04.381 --> 00:34:05.384
Oh, man.

00:34:05.941 --> 00:34:07.069
Sit down.

00:34:10.741 --> 00:34:13.621
Sir, I'm sorry I stole the suit.

00:34:13.821 --> 00:34:15.581
I don't even wanna know
why you have it.

00:34:15.781 --> 00:34:17.751
Maggie was right about you.

00:34:19.341 --> 00:34:20.221
How do you know about...

00:34:20.421 --> 00:34:22.463
No wonder she's trying
to keep you away from Cassie.

00:34:23.701 --> 00:34:25.301
The moment things get hard,

00:34:25.501 --> 00:34:26.948
you turn right back to crime.

00:34:29.461 --> 00:34:31.501
The way I see it,
you have a choice.

00:34:31.701 --> 00:34:34.354
You can either spend
the rest of your life in prison,

00:34:35.181 --> 00:34:37.026
or go back to your cell

00:34:37.621 --> 00:34:39.981
and await further instructions.

00:34:40.181 --> 00:34:41.461
I don't understand.

00:34:41.661 --> 00:34:43.701
No, I don't expect you to.

00:34:43.901 --> 00:34:46.821
But you don't have many options
right now, and quite frankly,

00:34:47.021 --> 00:34:48.354
neither do I.

00:34:49.261 --> 00:34:52.981
Why do you think I let you
steal that suit in the first place?

00:34:53.181 --> 00:34:54.344
What?

00:35:04.581 --> 00:35:07.701
Second chances don't come around
all that much.

00:35:07.901 --> 00:35:10.821
So, next time you think
you might see one,

00:35:11.021 --> 00:35:15.506
I suggest you take a real close look at it.

00:35:27.541 --> 00:35:29.621
<i>You're my bestest friend!</i>

00:35:29.821 --> 00:35:31.701
Are you sure you
don't want a different toy?

00:35:31.901 --> 00:35:33.826
No, I love this one.

00:35:34.421 --> 00:35:37.154
Okay. Well, get some sleep. I love you.

00:35:37.781 --> 00:35:39.061
- Mommy?
- Hmm?

00:35:39.261 --> 00:35:41.584
Is Daddy a bad man?

00:35:42.181 --> 00:35:45.027
I heard some grownups say he's bad.

00:35:45.821 --> 00:35:47.109
No.

00:35:47.981 --> 00:35:51.032
Daddy just gets confused sometimes,
you know?

00:36:42.461 --> 00:36:45.467
<i>Smart choice.
You actually listened, for once.</i>

00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:47.504
<i>Under the door.</i>

00:36:52.981 --> 00:36:54.101
Okay, where to now?

00:36:54.301 --> 00:36:56.305
<i>- Hang tight.</i>
- Oh, God.

00:36:59.141 --> 00:37:00.021
What, what?

00:37:00.221 --> 00:37:01.101
Where the hell did he go?

00:37:01.301 --> 00:37:02.461
I have no idea.
He just vanished.

00:37:02.661 --> 00:37:04.501
Set up a five-block perimeter. Now!

00:37:04.701 --> 00:37:05.781
Get back! Get back!

00:37:05.981 --> 00:37:08.589
<i>Scott, these are my associates.</i>

00:37:09.021 --> 00:37:10.381
Is that a camera on an ant?

00:37:10.581 --> 00:37:12.341
Yeah, sure. Why not?

00:37:12.541 --> 00:37:13.421
Where's the car?

00:37:13.621 --> 00:37:15.141
<i>No car. We've got wings.</i>

00:37:15.341 --> 00:37:16.629
<i>Incoming!</i>

00:37:26.541 --> 00:37:29.461
<i>Put your foot on the central node
and mount the thorax.</i>

00:37:29.661 --> 00:37:31.663
- How safe is...
<i>- Just get on the damn ant, Scott!</i>

00:37:44.741 --> 00:37:48.181
Why am I on a police car?
Shouldn't I not be on a police car?

00:37:48.381 --> 00:37:50.661
<i>So they can give you a lift
past their five-block perimeter.</i>

00:37:50.861 --> 00:37:52.381
All right.

00:37:52.581 --> 00:37:54.421
- Now, what's the next move?
<i>- Hang on tight.</i>

00:37:54.621 --> 00:37:56.261
Oh, this is easy!
I'm getting the hang of this.

00:37:56.461 --> 00:37:57.981
Yank up to go up.
It's like a horse.

00:37:58.181 --> 00:38:00.101
<i>You're throwing 247 off balance.</i>

00:38:00.301 --> 00:38:01.581
Wait, his name is 247?

00:38:01.781 --> 00:38:03.421
<i>He doesn't have a name,
he has a number, Scott.</i>

00:38:03.621 --> 00:38:06.061
<i>Do you have any idea
how many ants there are?</i>

00:38:06.261 --> 00:38:07.861
Whoa!

00:38:08.061 --> 00:38:09.821
<i>Maybe it's... Maybe it's 248.</i>

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:11.341
No, no! Vertigo, vertigo!

00:38:11.541 --> 00:38:13.545
<i>- No, I think it's 247.</i>
- Wait.

00:38:13.901 --> 00:38:15.341
<i>Hang on tight!</i>

00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:17.421
I think
I'm getting the hang of this.

00:38:17.621 --> 00:38:20.381
<i>I am controlling 247.
He is not listening to you.</i>

00:38:20.581 --> 00:38:21.421
What?

00:38:21.621 --> 00:38:23.512
- Can I make one little request?
<i>- No.</i>

00:38:25.061 --> 00:38:26.906
Stop, 247! Time out, time out.

00:38:27.701 --> 00:38:28.741
Time out.

00:38:28.941 --> 00:38:29.901
All right, hold on.

00:38:30.101 --> 00:38:31.992
Just wait! Whoa!

00:38:32.581 --> 00:38:34.101
What happens
if I throw up in this helmet?

00:38:34.301 --> 00:38:37.541
<i>It's my helmet, Scott.
You do not throw up.</i>

00:38:37.741 --> 00:38:39.221
Let's set her down, all right?

00:38:39.421 --> 00:38:40.301
I'm getting light-headed.

00:38:40.501 --> 00:38:41.584
<i>Hang on, Scott.</i>

00:38:42.261 --> 00:38:44.101
I'm getting a little light...

00:38:44.301 --> 00:38:46.226
I need a snooze button.

00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:49.110
Hit me in 5 minutes.

00:39:07.701 --> 00:39:08.943
Hello.

00:39:12.381 --> 00:39:13.544
Who are you?

00:39:15.621 --> 00:39:18.261
Have you been standing there,
watching me sleep, this whole time?

00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:19.421
Yes.

00:39:19.621 --> 00:39:20.784
Why?

00:39:21.541 --> 00:39:23.783
Because the last time you were here,
you stole something.

00:39:24.861 --> 00:39:26.786
Oh. Oh.

00:39:27.461 --> 00:39:28.624
Hey, look...

00:39:29.541 --> 00:39:30.544
Whoa!

00:39:35.181 --> 00:39:36.781
<i>Paraponera clavata.</i>

00:39:36.981 --> 00:39:38.341
Giant tropical bullet ants,

00:39:38.541 --> 00:39:39.981
ranked highest
on the Schmidt pain index.

00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:42.063
They're here to keep an eye on you
when I can't.

00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:45.948
Dr. Pym's waiting for you downstairs.

00:39:46.541 --> 00:39:47.544
Who?

00:39:49.901 --> 00:39:50.781
Hey!

00:39:50.981 --> 00:39:53.668
Um... Whose pajamas are these?

00:40:00.061 --> 00:40:01.986
How am I supposed to do this?

00:40:08.221 --> 00:40:11.306
All right, just one step at a time.

00:40:13.421 --> 00:40:14.424
Ugh!

00:40:16.101 --> 00:40:20.586
You don't bite me,
I don't step on you. Deal?

00:40:24.381 --> 00:40:26.581
I could take down the servers
and Cross wouldn't even know it.

00:40:26.781 --> 00:40:27.861
We don't need this guy.

00:40:28.061 --> 00:40:30.421
I assume that you've already
met my daughter, Hope.

00:40:30.621 --> 00:40:33.061
I did. She's great.

00:40:33.261 --> 00:40:35.381
She doesn't think that we need you.

00:40:35.581 --> 00:40:36.821
We don't. We can do this ourselves.

00:40:37.021 --> 00:40:40.141
I go to all this effort
to let you steal my suit,

00:40:40.341 --> 00:40:42.781
and then Hope has you arrested.

00:40:42.981 --> 00:40:45.901
Okay, we can try this and when he fails,
I'll do it myself.

00:40:46.101 --> 00:40:47.707
She's a little bit anxious.

00:40:48.261 --> 00:40:49.581
It has to do with this job,

00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.181
which, judging by the fact
that you're sitting opposite me,

00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:54.501
I take it that you're interested in.

00:40:54.701 --> 00:40:55.701
What job?

00:40:55.901 --> 00:40:57.064
Would you like some tea?

00:40:57.581 --> 00:40:59.181
Uh... Sure.

00:40:59.381 --> 00:41:00.861
I was very impressed with

00:41:01.061 --> 00:41:03.873
how you managed to get
past my security system.

00:41:05.101 --> 00:41:07.981
Freezing that metal
was particularly clever.

00:41:08.181 --> 00:41:09.501
Were you watching me?

00:41:09.701 --> 00:41:12.781
Scott, I've been watching you for a while.

00:41:12.981 --> 00:41:15.384
Ever since you robbed Vista Corp.

00:41:16.861 --> 00:41:18.501
Oh! Excuse me.

00:41:18.701 --> 00:41:20.671
"Burgled" Vista Corp.

00:41:22.301 --> 00:41:26.141
Vista's security system was one of
the most advanced in the business.

00:41:26.341 --> 00:41:27.941
It was supposed to be unbeatable.

00:41:28.141 --> 00:41:29.941
But you beat it.

00:41:30.141 --> 00:41:31.341
Would you like some sugar?

00:41:31.541 --> 00:41:33.113
Yeah, thanks.

00:41:37.021 --> 00:41:38.263
You know what?
I'm okay.

00:41:43.221 --> 00:41:45.261
How do you make them do that?

00:41:45.461 --> 00:41:47.981
Ants can lift objects
50 times their weight.

00:41:48.181 --> 00:41:51.701
They build, farm,
they cooperate with each other.

00:41:51.901 --> 00:41:54.065
Right. But how do you
make them do that?

00:41:56.021 --> 00:42:01.632
I use electromagnetic waves
to stimulate their olfactory nerve center.

00:42:02.821 --> 00:42:04.581
I speak to them.

00:42:04.781 --> 00:42:07.061
I can go anywhere, hear anything,

00:42:07.261 --> 00:42:08.541
and see everything.

00:42:08.741 --> 00:42:10.632
And still know absolutely nothing.

00:42:11.221 --> 00:42:12.270
I'm late to meet Cross.

00:42:16.101 --> 00:42:17.741
Uh... Dr. Pym?

00:42:17.941 --> 00:42:20.264
You don't need to raise your hand, Scott.

00:42:20.821 --> 00:42:23.341
Sorry, I just have one question.

00:42:23.541 --> 00:42:25.541
Who are you, who is she,
what the hell's going on,

00:42:25.741 --> 00:42:27.261
and can I go back to jail now?

00:42:27.461 --> 00:42:28.874
Come with me.

00:42:29.501 --> 00:42:33.501
40 years ago, I created a formula
that altered atomic relative distance.

00:42:33.701 --> 00:42:34.781
Huh?

00:42:34.981 --> 00:42:37.101
I learned how to change
the distance between atoms.

00:42:37.301 --> 00:42:38.901
That's what powers the suit.

00:42:39.101 --> 00:42:40.787
That's why it works.

00:42:41.981 --> 00:42:42.984
Wow.

00:42:48.381 --> 00:42:49.987
- Whoa!
- But it was dangerous.

00:42:50.661 --> 00:42:52.745
It was too dangerous.

00:42:53.981 --> 00:42:55.951
So I hid it from the world.

00:42:56.781 --> 00:42:59.753
And that's when I switched gears
and I started my own company.

00:43:00.661 --> 00:43:01.661
Pym Tech.

00:43:01.861 --> 00:43:02.989
Yes.

00:43:03.941 --> 00:43:07.621
I took on a young protégé
called Darren Cross.

00:43:07.821 --> 00:43:08.941
Darren Cross.

00:43:09.141 --> 00:43:10.061
He's a big deal.

00:43:10.261 --> 00:43:12.621
But before he was a big deal,
he was my assistant.

00:43:12.821 --> 00:43:17.021
I thought I saw something in him.
The son I never had, perhaps.

00:43:17.221 --> 00:43:19.421
He was brilliant,
but as we became close,

00:43:19.621 --> 00:43:23.101
he began to suspect
that I wasn't telling him everything.

00:43:23.301 --> 00:43:26.821
He heard rumors about
what was called the Pym Particle,

00:43:27.021 --> 00:43:30.232
and he became obsessed
with recreating my formula.

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:31.661
But I wouldn't help him.

00:43:31.861 --> 00:43:35.581
So he conspired against me and
he voted me out of my own company.

00:43:35.781 --> 00:43:37.181
How could he do that?

00:43:37.381 --> 00:43:40.061
The board's chairman
is my daughter, Hope.

00:43:40.261 --> 00:43:41.594
She was the deciding vote.

00:43:43.741 --> 00:43:45.061
But she came back to me

00:43:45.261 --> 00:43:48.631
when she saw how close
Cross was to cracking my formula.

00:43:49.701 --> 00:43:51.821
The process is highly volatile.

00:43:52.021 --> 00:43:54.741
If one isn't protected
by a specialized helmet,

00:43:54.941 --> 00:43:57.833
it can affect the brain's chemistry.

00:43:58.461 --> 00:44:00.741
I don't think Darren realizes this,

00:44:00.941 --> 00:44:03.787
and, you know, he's not
the most stable guy to begin with.

00:44:04.461 --> 00:44:06.625
So, what do you want from me?

00:44:08.701 --> 00:44:12.261
Scott, I believe that everyone deserves
a shot at redemption.

00:44:12.461 --> 00:44:13.341
Do you?

00:44:13.541 --> 00:44:14.988
I do.

00:44:15.661 --> 00:44:17.021
If you can help me,

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:20.944
I promise I can help you be
with your daughter again.

00:44:21.981 --> 00:44:24.350
Now, are you ready to redeem yourself?

00:44:24.941 --> 00:44:25.901
Absolutely.

00:44:26.101 --> 00:44:29.869
My days of breaking into places
and stealing shit are done.

00:44:30.941 --> 00:44:32.181
What do you want me to do?

00:44:32.381 --> 00:44:35.785
I want you to break into a place
and steal some shit.

00:44:38.661 --> 00:44:40.263
Are you gonna be home
for dinner tonight?

00:44:42.261 --> 00:44:44.381
Uh, yeah. I'll pick something up.
Text me.

00:44:44.581 --> 00:44:45.869
Okay. Good news?

00:44:46.221 --> 00:44:48.261
Uh... I don't know. It's news.

00:44:48.461 --> 00:44:50.989
Are you trying to find my daddy?

00:44:52.821 --> 00:44:54.632
Yeah, I am, sweetheart.

00:44:55.901 --> 00:44:57.221
I just want your daddy to be safe.

00:44:57.421 --> 00:44:59.551
Hope you don't catch him.

00:45:45.701 --> 00:45:47.221
This isn't the first time these guys

00:45:47.421 --> 00:45:50.101
have tried to get their hands
on game-changing weaponry.

00:45:50.301 --> 00:45:54.221
That's Mitchell Carson,
Ex-Head of Defense at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:45:54.421 --> 00:45:56.790
Presently in the business
of toppling governments.

00:45:57.341 --> 00:45:59.101
He always wanted my tech.

00:45:59.301 --> 00:46:02.501
And now, unless we break in
and steal the Yellowjacket

00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:04.831
and destroy all the data,

00:46:05.501 --> 00:46:10.873
Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos
upon the world.

00:46:13.261 --> 00:46:17.348
I think our first move should be
calling the Avengers.

00:46:18.661 --> 00:46:20.301
I spent half my life

00:46:20.501 --> 00:46:23.541
trying to keep this technology
out of the hands of a Stark.

00:46:23.741 --> 00:46:27.381
I'm sure as hell not gonna
hand-deliver it to one now.

00:46:27.581 --> 00:46:30.861
This is not some cute technology
like the Iron Man suit.

00:46:31.061 --> 00:46:33.589
This could change the texture of reality.

00:46:35.541 --> 00:46:39.593
Besides, they're probably too busy
dropping cities out of the sky.

00:46:40.221 --> 00:46:42.146
Okay, then why don't you
just send the ants?

00:46:42.821 --> 00:46:44.821
Scott, they are ants.

00:46:45.021 --> 00:46:48.948
Ants, they can do a lot of things,
but they still need a leader.

00:46:50.021 --> 00:46:54.741
Somebody that could infiltrate a place
that's designed to prevent infiltration.

00:46:54.941 --> 00:46:58.421
Hank, I'm a thief, all right? I mean,
I'm a good thief, but this is insane.

00:46:58.621 --> 00:47:00.581
He's right, Hank.
And you know it.

00:47:00.781 --> 00:47:03.389
You've seen the footage,
you know what Cross is capable of.

00:47:03.941 --> 00:47:05.381
I was against using him
when we had months,

00:47:05.581 --> 00:47:07.421
and now we have days.

00:47:07.621 --> 00:47:08.501
I'm wearing the suit.

00:47:08.701 --> 00:47:09.981
Absolutely not!

00:47:10.181 --> 00:47:12.981
I know the facility inside and out.
I know how Cross thinks.

00:47:13.181 --> 00:47:14.621
I know this mission
better than anybody here.

00:47:14.821 --> 00:47:17.381
We need you close to Cross.
Otherwise, this mission cannot work.

00:47:17.581 --> 00:47:19.901
- We don't have time to screw around!
- Hope, please listen to me...

00:47:20.101 --> 00:47:21.541
He is a criminal!
I'm your daughter.

00:47:21.741 --> 00:47:23.074
No!

00:48:01.461 --> 00:48:03.101
She's right, Hank.

00:48:03.301 --> 00:48:04.987
I'm not your guy.

00:48:05.581 --> 00:48:07.781
Why don't you wear the suit?

00:48:07.981 --> 00:48:10.061
You think I don't want to?

00:48:10.261 --> 00:48:11.503
I can't.

00:48:13.141 --> 00:48:14.986
I spent years wearing it,

00:48:15.621 --> 00:48:17.830
and it took a toll on me.

00:48:25.221 --> 00:48:26.554
You're our only option.

00:48:32.021 --> 00:48:34.741
Before Hope lost her mother,

00:48:34.941 --> 00:48:38.868
she used to look at me like
I was the greatest man in the world.

00:48:40.741 --> 00:48:44.031
And now she looks at me
and there's just disappointment.

00:48:47.341 --> 00:48:49.345
It's too late for me,

00:48:50.581 --> 00:48:52.221
but not for you.

00:48:52.421 --> 00:48:54.221
This is your chance.

00:48:54.421 --> 00:48:57.901
The chance to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes.

00:48:58.101 --> 00:49:01.994
To become the hero
that she already thinks you are.

00:49:02.701 --> 00:49:05.229
It's not about saving our world.

00:49:06.101 --> 00:49:08.913
It's about saving theirs.

00:49:11.861 --> 00:49:13.706
Damn. That was a good speech.

00:49:14.301 --> 00:49:15.384
Scott,

00:49:16.421 --> 00:49:20.223
I need you to be the Ant-Man.

00:49:23.381 --> 00:49:24.541
In the right hands,

00:49:24.741 --> 00:49:27.901
the relationship between man and suit
is symbiotic.

00:49:28.101 --> 00:49:31.741
The suit has power.
The man harnesses that power.

00:49:31.941 --> 00:49:34.661
You need to be skillful, agile,
and above all,

00:49:34.861 --> 00:49:35.941
you need to be fast.

00:49:36.141 --> 00:49:37.941
You should be able to shrink and grow

00:49:38.141 --> 00:49:39.349
on a dime.

00:49:39.941 --> 00:49:43.265
So your size always suits your needs.

00:49:44.301 --> 00:49:46.061
Now dive through the keyhole, Scott.

00:49:46.261 --> 00:49:50.234
You charge big, you dive small,
then you emerge big.

00:49:52.101 --> 00:49:53.628
Ow!

00:49:54.941 --> 00:49:55.944
Ahhh!

00:49:56.381 --> 00:49:57.941
Ow!

00:49:58.141 --> 00:49:59.269
Useless.

00:50:01.581 --> 00:50:02.901
When you're small,
energy's compressed,

00:50:03.101 --> 00:50:04.901
so you have the force
of a 200-pound man

00:50:05.101 --> 00:50:08.261
behind a fist a 100th of an inch wide.
You're like a bullet.

00:50:08.461 --> 00:50:11.701
You punch too hard, you kill someone.
Too soft, it's a love tap.

00:50:11.901 --> 00:50:13.261
In other words,
you have to know how to punch.

00:50:13.461 --> 00:50:15.101
I was in prison for three years.
I know how to punch.

00:50:15.301 --> 00:50:16.901
Show me.

00:50:17.101 --> 00:50:18.863
- Terrible.
- You wanna show me how to punch?

00:50:19.461 --> 00:50:20.464
Show me...

00:50:21.901 --> 00:50:23.541
That's how you punch.

00:50:23.741 --> 00:50:26.381
- She's been looking forward to this.
- No kidding.

00:50:26.581 --> 00:50:29.101
Hope trained in martial arts
at a difficult time.

00:50:29.301 --> 00:50:31.261
Oh, by "difficult time,"
he means when my mother died.

00:50:31.461 --> 00:50:33.381
We lost her in a plane crash.

00:50:33.581 --> 00:50:35.181
It's bad enough
you won't tell me how she died.

00:50:35.381 --> 00:50:36.821
Could you please stop
telling me that lie?

00:50:37.021 --> 00:50:38.787
We're working, here.

00:50:41.981 --> 00:50:43.703
All right, princess.
Let's get back to work.

00:50:44.461 --> 00:50:46.704
Were you going for the hand?

00:50:53.021 --> 00:50:55.021
You know, I think this regulator
is holding me back.

00:50:55.221 --> 00:50:57.781
Do not screw with the regulator.

00:50:57.981 --> 00:50:59.621
If that regulator is compromised,

00:50:59.821 --> 00:51:01.261
you would go subatomic.

00:51:01.461 --> 00:51:02.828
What does that mean?

00:51:03.901 --> 00:51:05.981
It means that you would enter
a quantum realm.

00:51:06.181 --> 00:51:07.461
What does that mean?

00:51:07.661 --> 00:51:12.061
It means that you would enter a reality
where all concepts of time and space

00:51:12.261 --> 00:51:13.181
become irrelevant

00:51:13.381 --> 00:51:16.227
as you shrink for all eternity.

00:51:16.981 --> 00:51:19.421
Everything that you know

00:51:19.621 --> 00:51:20.954
and love,

00:51:21.861 --> 00:51:23.433
gone forever.

00:51:24.341 --> 00:51:27.541
Cool. Yeah, if it ain't broke...

00:51:27.741 --> 00:51:28.941
You've learned about the suit,

00:51:29.141 --> 00:51:31.874
but you've yet to learn
about your greatest allies,

00:51:33.181 --> 00:51:34.230
the ants.

00:51:34.821 --> 00:51:35.981
Loyal, brave,

00:51:36.181 --> 00:51:37.992
<i>and your partners on this job.</i>

00:51:44.021 --> 00:51:46.821
Paratrechina longicornis.
<i>Commonly known as crazy ants.</i>

00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:49.101
<i>They're lightning fast
and can conduct electricity,</i>

00:51:49.301 --> 00:51:51.621
<i>which makes them useful
to fry out enemy electronics.</i>

00:51:51.821 --> 00:51:53.507
You're not so crazy.

00:51:53.741 --> 00:51:55.821
Hey!

00:51:56.021 --> 00:51:57.309
You're cute.

00:52:05.781 --> 00:52:07.911
That was a lot scarier a second ago.

00:52:17.261 --> 00:52:20.821
It looks like the Futures Lab
has its own isolated power supply.

00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:22.821
<i>There's a security guard posted
around the clock.</i>

00:52:23.021 --> 00:52:25.501
We'll need you to take him out
to deactivate the security systems.

00:52:25.701 --> 00:52:28.274
Okay, who's next?

00:52:30.301 --> 00:52:31.501
Paraponera clavata.

00:52:31.701 --> 00:52:33.221
<i>I know. Bullet ants, right?</i>

00:52:33.421 --> 00:52:34.901
Number 1 on the Schmidt pain index?

00:52:35.101 --> 00:52:36.912
Hey, guys.
Remember me from the bedroom?

00:52:39.701 --> 00:52:41.501
<i>The Yellowjacket pod
is hermetically sealed,</i>

00:52:41.701 --> 00:52:42.901
And the only access point is a tube

00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:45.741
we estimate to be about
5 millimeters in diameter.

00:52:45.941 --> 00:52:47.661
Why do I have a sick feeling
in my stomach?

00:52:47.861 --> 00:52:49.941
<i>The tube is protected
by a laser grid,</i>

00:52:50.141 --> 00:52:51.781
and we can only power that down
for 15 seconds.

00:52:51.981 --> 00:52:54.461
You're gonna need to signal
the crazy ants to blow the servers,

00:52:54.661 --> 00:52:58.621
retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults
before the backup power comes on.

00:52:58.821 --> 00:53:00.985
Camponotus pennsylvanicus.

00:53:01.701 --> 00:53:03.101
Alternatively known as a carpenter ant.

00:53:03.301 --> 00:53:05.981
Ideal for ground and air transport.

00:53:06.181 --> 00:53:07.867
Wait a minute, I know this guy.

00:53:09.141 --> 00:53:11.341
I'm gonna call him "Ant-thony."

00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:12.661
That's good. That's very good.

00:53:12.861 --> 00:53:17.381
Because this time, you're really gonna
have to learn how to control him.

00:53:17.581 --> 00:53:20.314
<i>Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.</i>

00:53:23.261 --> 00:53:24.549
Aw! You okay?
Did I hurt...

00:53:36.381 --> 00:53:38.341
Hank wants you outside
for target practice.

00:53:38.541 --> 00:53:40.781
<i>The suit has no weapons,
so I made you these discs.</i>

00:53:40.981 --> 00:53:42.223
<i>Red shrinks.</i>

00:53:43.261 --> 00:53:44.833
<i>Blue enlarges.</i>

00:53:46.741 --> 00:53:49.221
Solenopsis mandibularis.

00:53:49.421 --> 00:53:50.621
<i>Known for their bite,</i>

00:53:50.821 --> 00:53:53.421
<i>the fire ants have evolved
into remarkable architects.</i>

00:53:53.621 --> 00:53:56.706
<i>They are handy to get you in and out
of difficult places.</i>

00:54:06.261 --> 00:54:08.027
You can do it, Scott. Come on.

00:54:10.661 --> 00:54:12.621
They're not listening to me.

00:54:12.821 --> 00:54:15.341
You have to commit.
You have to mean it.

00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:17.461
No shortcuts, no lies.

00:54:17.661 --> 00:54:22.141
Throwing insults into the mix
will not do anyone any good, Hope.

00:54:22.341 --> 00:54:23.741
We don't have time for coddling.

00:54:23.941 --> 00:54:25.981
Our focus should be on helping Scott!

00:54:26.181 --> 00:54:27.594
Really?

00:54:28.741 --> 00:54:30.347
Is that where our focus should be?

00:54:54.701 --> 00:54:55.829
Hope!

00:55:04.621 --> 00:55:07.354
I don't know why I came to you
in the first place.

00:55:16.181 --> 00:55:18.470
We can't do this without her.

00:55:22.621 --> 00:55:23.581
Oh, God.

00:55:23.781 --> 00:55:25.621
You gotta lock your doors.

00:55:25.821 --> 00:55:28.581
I mean, really, there's some weird folks
in this neighborhood.

00:55:28.781 --> 00:55:30.467
Do you think this is a joke?

00:55:31.501 --> 00:55:33.901
Do you have any idea what
he's asking you to risk?

00:55:34.101 --> 00:55:35.221
You have a daughter.

00:55:35.421 --> 00:55:36.621
I'm doing this for her.

00:55:36.821 --> 00:55:39.793
You know, when my mother died,
I didn't see him for two weeks.

00:55:40.541 --> 00:55:41.421
He was in grief.

00:55:41.621 --> 00:55:42.861
Yeah, so was I, and I was seven.

00:55:43.061 --> 00:55:45.669
And he never came back.
Not in any way that counted.

00:55:46.621 --> 00:55:48.466
He just sent me off to boarding school.

00:55:49.781 --> 00:55:50.784
You know, I thought,

00:55:51.621 --> 00:55:52.861
with all that's at stake,

00:55:53.061 --> 00:55:56.101
just maybe we might have a chance
of making peace.

00:55:56.301 --> 00:55:58.101
But, even now,
he still wants to shut me out.

00:55:58.301 --> 00:56:01.061
He doesn't wanna shut you out.
He trusts you.

00:56:01.261 --> 00:56:02.501
Then why are you here?

00:56:02.701 --> 00:56:04.705
It proves that he loves you.

00:56:06.101 --> 00:56:08.390
Hope. Look at me.

00:56:09.661 --> 00:56:11.313
I'm expendable.

00:56:11.941 --> 00:56:13.388
That's why I'm here.

00:56:14.541 --> 00:56:16.386
You must have realized that by now.

00:56:17.261 --> 00:56:19.470
I mean, it's why I'm in the suit
and you're not.

00:56:21.341 --> 00:56:23.710
He would rather lose this fight
than lose you.

00:56:25.621 --> 00:56:26.670
Anyway...

00:56:27.981 --> 00:56:31.021
You know,
I didn't know you had a daughter

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:33.464
when I called the cops on you.

00:56:37.501 --> 00:56:38.664
What's her name?

00:56:39.501 --> 00:56:40.993
Cassie.

00:56:41.741 --> 00:56:43.507
It's a pretty name.

00:56:46.901 --> 00:56:49.621
You have to clear your mind, Scott.
You have to make your thoughts precise.

00:56:49.821 --> 00:56:51.791
That's how it works.

00:56:52.941 --> 00:56:54.221
Think about Cassie.

00:56:54.421 --> 00:56:58.348
About how badly you want to see her.
And use that to focus.

00:57:07.061 --> 00:57:08.741
Open your eyes

00:57:08.941 --> 00:57:11.310
and just think about
what you want the ants to do.

00:57:34.141 --> 00:57:35.383
That's good!

00:57:53.261 --> 00:57:56.021
Your mother convinced me

00:57:56.221 --> 00:57:59.306
to let her join me on my missions.

00:57:59.821 --> 00:58:01.861
They called her the Wasp.

00:58:02.061 --> 00:58:04.304
She was born to it.

00:58:05.941 --> 00:58:07.911
And there's not a day that goes by

00:58:08.781 --> 00:58:11.787
that I don't regret having said yes.

00:58:16.261 --> 00:58:17.947
It was 1987.

00:58:18.741 --> 00:58:23.226
Separatists had hijacked
a Soviet missile silo in Kursk

00:58:24.781 --> 00:58:27.753
and launched an ICBM
at the United States.

00:58:35.141 --> 00:58:38.221
<i>The only way to the internal mechanics</i>

00:58:38.421 --> 00:58:40.346
<i>was through solid titanium.</i>

00:58:49.621 --> 00:58:54.221
<i>I knew I had to shrink between
the molecules to disarm the missile.</i>

00:58:54.421 --> 00:58:57.666
<i>But my regulator had sustained
too much damage.</i>

00:58:59.381 --> 00:59:00.701
<i>Your mother,</i>

00:59:00.901 --> 00:59:02.268
<i>she didn't hesitate.</i>

00:59:04.421 --> 00:59:06.027
Janet! No!

00:59:12.781 --> 00:59:15.263
She turned off her regulator

00:59:16.021 --> 00:59:17.752
and went subatomic

00:59:19.221 --> 00:59:21.351
to deactivate the bomb.

00:59:23.141 --> 00:59:24.952
And she was gone.

00:59:29.381 --> 00:59:31.511
Your mom died a hero.

00:59:34.181 --> 00:59:36.421
And I spent the next 10 years

00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:40.947
trying to learn all I could
about the quantum realm.

00:59:44.501 --> 00:59:46.631
You were trying to bring her back.

00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:51.870
But all I learned was we know nothing.

00:59:56.861 --> 00:59:58.706
It's not your fault.

01:00:00.861 --> 01:00:02.547
She made her choice.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.581
But why didn't you tell me that sooner?

01:00:11.781 --> 01:00:14.753
I was trying to protect you.

01:00:16.581 --> 01:00:18.233
I lost your mother.

01:00:20.421 --> 01:00:23.108
I didn't mean to lose you, too.

01:00:23.941 --> 01:00:25.308
I'm sorry.

01:00:28.741 --> 01:00:29.949
This is awesome.

01:00:31.021 --> 01:00:32.581
It's awesome, you know?

01:00:32.781 --> 01:00:34.865
You guys are breaking down walls,
you're healing.

01:00:35.941 --> 01:00:37.388
It's important.

01:00:40.301 --> 01:00:41.661
I ruined the moment, didn't I?

01:00:41.861 --> 01:00:43.592
Yes, you did. Yes.

01:00:44.741 --> 01:00:46.666
I'm going to make some tea.

01:00:52.301 --> 01:00:53.384
Nailed it!

01:01:02.621 --> 01:01:04.671
That's a good boy, Ant-thony.

01:01:34.181 --> 01:01:37.301
<i>The final phase of your training
will be a stealth incursion.</i>

01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:38.541
It's freezing!

01:01:38.741 --> 01:01:41.110
You couldn't make a suit
with a flannel lining?

01:01:41.941 --> 01:01:44.541
You must retrieve this prototype
of a signal decoy.

01:01:44.741 --> 01:01:47.341
It's a device that I invented
during my S.H.I.E.L.D. days.

01:01:47.541 --> 01:01:49.101
We need it to counteract
the transmission blockers

01:01:49.301 --> 01:01:51.192
that Cross installed in the Futures vault.

01:01:52.701 --> 01:01:54.061
It's currently collecting dust

01:01:54.261 --> 01:01:57.261
in one of Howard Stark's old
storage facilities in upstate New York.

01:01:57.461 --> 01:01:59.341
<i>Should be a piece of cake.</i>

01:01:59.541 --> 01:02:01.301
You're over the target area.

01:02:01.501 --> 01:02:03.661
Disengage now, Scott!

01:02:03.861 --> 01:02:04.901
Squadron A, go!

01:02:05.101 --> 01:02:06.434
B, go!

01:02:08.781 --> 01:02:09.944
C, go!

01:02:10.861 --> 01:02:13.434
All right, Ant-thony,
please don't drop me this time.

01:02:14.261 --> 01:02:17.461
Oh, it feels like a big leap
from sugar cubes to this!

01:02:17.661 --> 01:02:18.710
Stay calm.

01:02:20.541 --> 01:02:22.301
Guys?
We might have a problem.

01:02:22.501 --> 01:02:25.821
Hank, didn't you say
this was some old warehouse?

01:02:26.021 --> 01:02:27.070
It's not!

01:02:28.501 --> 01:02:30.346
<i>You son of a bitch!</i>

01:02:32.741 --> 01:02:34.421
- Scott, get out of there.
- Abort!

01:02:34.621 --> 01:02:35.581
<i>Abort now!</i>

01:02:35.781 --> 01:02:38.421
No, it's okay.
It doesn't look like anyone's home.

01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:40.671
Ant-thony, get me to the roof!

01:02:41.541 --> 01:02:42.501
He's gonna lose the suit.

01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:44.193
He's gonna lose his life.

01:02:50.021 --> 01:02:52.151
<i>All right, I'm on the roof
of the target building.</i>

01:02:53.381 --> 01:02:54.873
Somebody's home, Scott.

01:02:58.021 --> 01:02:59.221
<i>What's going on down there, Sam?</i>

01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:00.549
It's the Falcon!

01:03:01.221 --> 01:03:03.351
I had a sensor trip
but I'm not seeing anything.

01:03:03.901 --> 01:03:04.821
Wait a second.

01:03:05.021 --> 01:03:06.861
Abort, Scott! Abort now!

01:03:07.061 --> 01:03:08.461
It's okay. He can't see me.

01:03:08.661 --> 01:03:09.581
I can see you.

01:03:09.781 --> 01:03:10.944
He can see me.

01:03:13.301 --> 01:03:15.101
Hi. I'm Scott.

01:03:15.301 --> 01:03:16.821
Did he just say, "Hi, I'm Scott"?

01:03:17.021 --> 01:03:20.181
- What are you doing here?
- First off, I'm a big fan.

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:22.033
Appreciate it. So, who the hell are you?

01:03:22.861 --> 01:03:23.901
I'm Ant-Man.

01:03:24.101 --> 01:03:25.261
"Ant-Man"?

01:03:25.461 --> 01:03:27.421
What? You haven't heard of me?

01:03:27.621 --> 01:03:29.387
No, you wouldn't have heard of me.

01:03:29.781 --> 01:03:31.141
You wanna tell me what you want?

01:03:31.341 --> 01:03:33.621
I was hoping I could grab
a piece of technology.

01:03:33.821 --> 01:03:35.421
Just for a few days. I'm gonna return it.

01:03:35.621 --> 01:03:38.141
I need it to save the world.
You know how that is.

01:03:38.341 --> 01:03:39.754
I know exactly how that is.

01:03:40.661 --> 01:03:41.581
Located the breach.

01:03:41.781 --> 01:03:43.263
- Bringing him in.
- Sorry about this!

01:03:47.741 --> 01:03:49.268
What the hell are you doing?

01:03:52.221 --> 01:03:54.943
Breach is an adult male,
who has some sort of shrinking tech.

01:04:08.101 --> 01:04:09.221
Sorry!

01:04:09.421 --> 01:04:10.913
Look, I'm sorry about this. Sorry.

01:04:11.661 --> 01:04:12.664
That's enough!

01:04:35.701 --> 01:04:37.387
Ant-thony! A little help!

01:04:50.021 --> 01:04:51.149
I've lost visual.

01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:01.541
He's inside my pack!

01:05:01.741 --> 01:05:02.790
Sorry!

01:05:04.381 --> 01:05:05.703
You seem like a really great guy.

01:05:30.741 --> 01:05:34.543
It's really important to me
that Cap never finds out about this.

01:05:37.821 --> 01:05:41.350
That was completely irresponsible
and dangerous!

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:44.264
You jeopardized everything!

01:06:00.221 --> 01:06:01.827
You got it.

01:06:04.821 --> 01:06:05.701
Well done.

01:06:05.901 --> 01:06:06.741
Wait a minute.

01:06:06.941 --> 01:06:08.221
Did you just compliment me?

01:06:08.421 --> 01:06:10.903
- He did, didn't he?
- Kind of sounded like he did.

01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:14.229
I was good, wasn't I?

01:06:15.781 --> 01:06:19.301
Hey, how about the fact that
I fought an Avenger and didn't die?

01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:21.861
Let us not dwell on the past.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.191
We gotta finish our planning.

01:06:26.541 --> 01:06:28.227
Don't mind him.

01:06:28.741 --> 01:06:29.744
You did good.

01:06:36.621 --> 01:06:37.909
Darren.

01:06:40.901 --> 01:06:42.553
How the hell did you get in here?

01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:46.024
You left the front door open, Hank.

01:06:46.421 --> 01:06:47.261
It's official.

01:06:47.461 --> 01:06:48.624
You're old.

01:06:49.181 --> 01:06:50.344
The plans.

01:06:51.741 --> 01:06:53.347
He will kill him.

01:06:56.581 --> 01:06:59.268
Well, to what do I owe this pleasure?

01:07:00.301 --> 01:07:01.661
I have good news.

01:07:01.861 --> 01:07:03.103
Really?

01:07:03.941 --> 01:07:04.944
What's that?

01:07:05.541 --> 01:07:10.061
Pym Tech, the company you created,

01:07:10.261 --> 01:07:13.941
is about to become one of the most
profitable operations in the world.

01:07:14.141 --> 01:07:17.909
We're anticipating $15 billion in sales,
tomorrow alone.

01:07:24.501 --> 01:07:25.629
You're welcome.

01:07:29.981 --> 01:07:32.463
I know this is odd,
but I'd like you to be there.

01:07:33.141 --> 01:07:35.145
This is my moment.
I want you to see it.

01:07:36.381 --> 01:07:37.821
Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure.

01:07:38.021 --> 01:07:39.309
I'll be there.

01:07:56.381 --> 01:07:57.828
What did you see in me?

01:07:59.021 --> 01:08:00.434
I don't know what you mean.

01:08:01.341 --> 01:08:03.821
All those years ago, you picked me.

01:08:04.021 --> 01:08:05.513
What did you see?

01:08:07.701 --> 01:08:09.467
I saw myself.

01:08:10.061 --> 01:08:12.464
Then why did you push me away?

01:08:14.021 --> 01:08:17.345
Because I saw too much of myself.

01:08:28.221 --> 01:08:29.501
<i>He knows. He's baiting you.</i>

01:08:29.701 --> 01:08:31.301
We have to call it off.

01:08:31.501 --> 01:08:32.541
We're all taking risks.

01:08:32.741 --> 01:08:33.941
What if he saw me here?

01:08:34.141 --> 01:08:35.341
He didn't. There's no way.

01:08:35.541 --> 01:08:37.910
How do you know that?

01:08:45.381 --> 01:08:46.581
Darren, hi.

01:08:46.781 --> 01:08:49.593
Hope, where are you right now?

01:08:50.221 --> 01:08:51.301
I'm at home. Why?

01:08:51.501 --> 01:08:53.141
<i>I just saw Hank.</i>

01:08:53.341 --> 01:08:55.021
<i>I still get nothing but contempt from him.</i>

01:08:55.221 --> 01:08:58.661
Don't let him rile you up.
He's just a senile old man.

01:08:58.861 --> 01:09:01.221
<i>We need to start everyone working
around the clock.</i>

01:09:01.421 --> 01:09:03.101
<i>Get the assembly line up and running.</i>

01:09:03.301 --> 01:09:04.461
<i>And I'm tripling security.</i>

01:09:04.661 --> 01:09:06.541
Full sensors at all entrances

01:09:06.741 --> 01:09:10.061
and exterior air vents
fitted with steel micro-mesh.

01:09:10.261 --> 01:09:11.741
Great. Good idea.

01:09:11.941 --> 01:09:16.267
<i>Thank you, Hope.
I'm so lucky to have you on my team.</i>

01:09:18.701 --> 01:09:23.061
He's tripling security.
He's lost his mind, and he's onto you.

01:09:23.261 --> 01:09:25.101
But he is not onto you.

01:09:25.301 --> 01:09:27.581
He's adding full body scanners
to all entrances

01:09:27.781 --> 01:09:29.381
and closing exterior vents.

01:09:29.581 --> 01:09:31.506
How are we gonna get Scott inside?

01:09:33.021 --> 01:09:34.548
The water main.

01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:37.461
You can't add security to a water main.

01:09:37.661 --> 01:09:39.861
The pressure is too strong,
but if we can decrease it,

01:09:40.061 --> 01:09:41.141
that's how I get in.

01:09:41.341 --> 01:09:43.421
Somebody would have to reach
the building's control center

01:09:43.621 --> 01:09:44.861
to change the water pressure.

01:09:45.061 --> 01:09:47.661
Hank and I will be beside Cross.
How are we supposed to do that?

01:09:47.861 --> 01:09:49.388
So we expand our team.

01:09:49.981 --> 01:09:50.861
What do we need?

01:09:51.061 --> 01:09:54.341
A fake security guard on the inside
to de-pressurize the water system,

01:09:54.541 --> 01:09:56.261
somebody else to hack in
to the power supply

01:09:56.461 --> 01:09:57.741
and kill the laser grid,

01:09:57.941 --> 01:10:00.141
and a getaway guy.

01:10:00.341 --> 01:10:04.314
No, no. No, no, no.
Not those three Wombats. No way.

01:10:04.941 --> 01:10:06.261
Thank you for the coffee, ma'am.

01:10:06.461 --> 01:10:09.941
It's not too often that you rob a place
and then get welcomed back.

01:10:10.141 --> 01:10:12.032
Because we just robbed you.

01:10:13.581 --> 01:10:17.021
You know that he was arrested
for stealing a smoothie machine, right?

01:10:17.221 --> 01:10:18.421
Two smoothie machines.

01:10:18.621 --> 01:10:20.061
Are you sure they can handle this?

01:10:20.261 --> 01:10:21.541
Oh, we can handle it.
We're professionals.

01:10:21.741 --> 01:10:25.261
You'll forgive us if we're not
instilled with confidence.

01:10:25.461 --> 01:10:27.981
Well, hey, everybody just kick back
and relax a little bit, man.

01:10:28.181 --> 01:10:29.381
We know our business.

01:10:29.581 --> 01:10:31.821
We broke into this spooky-ass house,
didn't we?

01:10:32.021 --> 01:10:33.341
I let you.

01:10:33.541 --> 01:10:36.701
Well, one could say that
I let you let me.

01:10:36.901 --> 01:10:40.101
- Look, it's okay. They can handle this.
- Yeah, we can handle it.

01:10:40.301 --> 01:10:41.941
- You got their credentials?
- He's in the system.

01:10:42.141 --> 01:10:44.501
- I'm in the system?
- You're in the system.

01:10:44.701 --> 01:10:45.781
The system?

01:10:45.981 --> 01:10:48.141
Yeah, we're doomed.

01:10:48.341 --> 01:10:49.261
All right.

01:10:49.461 --> 01:10:51.021
There's something
you guys need to see.

01:10:51.221 --> 01:10:52.941
When you get to this corner,

01:10:53.141 --> 01:10:55.781
there's gonna be three offices
on your left side.

01:10:55.981 --> 01:10:57.314
Damn!

01:10:58.981 --> 01:11:01.581
Whoa! That's so cool, bro!

01:11:01.781 --> 01:11:04.341
Now, look,
this is gonna get weird, all right?

01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:07.661
It's pretty freaky, but it's safe.
There's no reason to be scared.

01:11:07.861 --> 01:11:09.061
Oh, no, no. Daddy don't get scared.

01:11:09.261 --> 01:11:10.981
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:11:11.181 --> 01:11:12.344
Good.

01:11:19.501 --> 01:11:21.301
This is the work of gypsies.

01:11:21.501 --> 01:11:22.501
That's witchcraft.

01:11:22.701 --> 01:11:23.864
Wow, that's amazing.

01:11:24.501 --> 01:11:25.861
That's like some David Copperfield shit.

01:11:26.061 --> 01:11:27.021
That's some kind of wizardry.

01:11:27.221 --> 01:11:28.181
This is sorcery!

01:11:28.381 --> 01:11:29.381
How'd you do that, bro?

01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:31.551
Don't freak out.
Look at your shoulder.

01:11:32.061 --> 01:11:33.221
Ahhh!

01:11:33.421 --> 01:11:34.741
Get off! Get off!

01:11:34.941 --> 01:11:37.469
Wait, I thought
Daddy didn't get scared!

01:11:39.741 --> 01:11:41.021
I gave them each half a Xanax

01:11:41.221 --> 01:11:43.701
and Hank explained the science
of the suit to them.

01:11:43.901 --> 01:11:46.065
They fell right asleep.

01:11:46.741 --> 01:11:49.221
Hey, look, I wanna thank you for...

01:11:49.421 --> 01:11:51.221
No, please don't.

01:11:51.421 --> 01:11:53.741
We're all doing this for reasons
much bigger than any one of us.

01:11:53.941 --> 01:11:57.661
I'm just glad that you might have
a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.

01:11:57.861 --> 01:12:00.821
Hey, thank you, you know,
for that pep talk.

01:12:01.021 --> 01:12:03.581
You know, the honest truth is,
I actually went from despising you

01:12:03.781 --> 01:12:05.261
to almost liking you.

01:12:05.461 --> 01:12:07.192
You really should write poetry.

01:12:10.541 --> 01:12:12.272
Get some sleep, Scott.

01:13:02.781 --> 01:13:05.461
All right, just so we're clear,
everyone here knows their role, right?

01:13:05.661 --> 01:13:07.141
- Dave?
- Wheels on the ground.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:08.541
- Kurt?
- Eyes in the sky.

01:13:08.741 --> 01:13:10.061
- Luis?
- Oh, man, you know it.

01:13:10.261 --> 01:13:11.621
You know what?
I get to wear a uniform.

01:13:11.821 --> 01:13:13.301
- That's what's up.
- Luis.

01:13:13.501 --> 01:13:15.581
I'm sorry. I'm good. I'm good.
I'm just excited.

01:13:15.781 --> 01:13:16.981
Plus, your girlfriend's really hot.

01:13:17.181 --> 01:13:18.381
So, you know,
that makes me nervous, too.

01:13:18.581 --> 01:13:19.461
And you are very beautiful, ma'am.

01:13:19.661 --> 01:13:21.421
- Oh, my Lord.
- She's not my...

01:13:21.621 --> 01:13:23.781
You know what? I was thinking of
a tactic, like when I go undercover.

01:13:23.981 --> 01:13:25.781
Like a whistling. You know
what I'm saying? To like, blend in.

01:13:25.981 --> 01:13:28.941
No. Don't whistle. No whistling.

01:13:29.141 --> 01:13:31.191
It's not <i>The Andy Griffith</i> Show.
No whistling.

01:13:48.941 --> 01:13:50.229
All clear in Sector One.

01:13:55.381 --> 01:13:56.544
Step out.

01:13:59.141 --> 01:14:00.349
All clear.

01:14:06.021 --> 01:14:07.149
We're set.

01:14:07.701 --> 01:14:09.068
Wish me luck.

01:14:20.421 --> 01:14:22.187
Utilities online.

01:14:34.621 --> 01:14:36.432
Hey! What are you doing?

01:14:36.981 --> 01:14:41.591
Uh... Boss-man said to secure the area,
so I'm securing it.

01:14:42.981 --> 01:14:44.314
I'm the boss.

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:46.073
- Oh.
- Utilities 1.3...

01:15:00.221 --> 01:15:02.305
<i>Water level is dropping!</i>

01:15:30.821 --> 01:15:32.541
<i>Coming up on extraction pipe.</i>

01:15:32.741 --> 01:15:34.154
All right, I see it.

01:15:42.301 --> 01:15:45.625
All right, come on, I gotta get up there.
That's it. That's it, guys! Yes!

01:15:48.741 --> 01:15:51.872
Yes! You got it! You got it! Come on!

01:15:56.341 --> 01:15:58.664
All right, let's fly, Ant-thony.

01:16:09.061 --> 01:16:11.021
The Ant-Man is in the building.

01:16:11.221 --> 01:16:14.147
Pym's pulling up. Right on time.

01:16:16.181 --> 01:16:18.101
Got a Crown Vic right outside there.

01:16:18.301 --> 01:16:19.381
This is problem?

01:16:19.581 --> 01:16:21.501
Considering the Crown Vic's
the most commonly used car

01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:22.864
for undercover cops, man,

01:16:23.621 --> 01:16:25.034
yes, this is problem.

01:16:28.861 --> 01:16:30.024
That's Pym.

01:16:32.741 --> 01:16:33.981
Oh, no.

01:16:34.181 --> 01:16:35.341
I'm deploying the bullet ants.

01:16:35.541 --> 01:16:36.941
<i>Papanera Claire de Merna Merna...</i>

01:16:37.141 --> 01:16:40.067
<i>I don't remember what it's called,
but I feel bad for this guy.</i>

01:16:41.381 --> 01:16:42.509
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

01:16:48.341 --> 01:16:49.788
Ow! Ow!

01:16:52.541 --> 01:16:53.541
See? That's what I'm talking about.

01:16:53.741 --> 01:16:56.021
That's what I call
an unfortunate casualty

01:16:56.221 --> 01:16:58.225
in a very serious operation.

01:17:07.461 --> 01:17:09.591
Signal decoy in place.

01:17:10.141 --> 01:17:12.066
Mean, pretty lady did good, Scott.

01:17:13.301 --> 01:17:15.461
Looks like Pym's getting arrested.

01:17:15.661 --> 01:17:17.221
Scott, we have problem.

01:17:17.421 --> 01:17:19.346
<i>Problem? What's the problem?</i>

01:17:20.181 --> 01:17:22.541
Dave! Dave, that's not part of plan!

01:17:22.741 --> 01:17:24.261
Listen to me.

01:17:24.461 --> 01:17:28.263
If I don't get into this building,
people will die.

01:17:28.901 --> 01:17:30.632
That's awfully dramatic.

01:17:33.501 --> 01:17:34.789
Are you kidding me?

01:17:39.261 --> 01:17:41.027
Problem solved.

01:17:55.941 --> 01:17:57.149
Well...

01:17:58.941 --> 01:18:00.786
How do I look?

01:18:10.061 --> 01:18:11.064
There he is.

01:18:12.701 --> 01:18:15.866
Just in time. Come on.

01:18:25.181 --> 01:18:26.941
<i>12-point verification.</i>

01:18:27.141 --> 01:18:28.821
Little over-the-top,
don't you think, Darren?

01:18:29.021 --> 01:18:30.421
<i>Confirming authorization level.</i>

01:18:30.621 --> 01:18:32.101
Well, you can never be too safe.

01:18:32.301 --> 01:18:33.823
<i>Access granted.</i>

01:18:41.021 --> 01:18:42.513
Gotta hand it to you, Darren.

01:18:43.181 --> 01:18:45.021
You really did it.

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.066
And you only know the half of it, Hank.

01:19:13.261 --> 01:19:14.913
Arriving in second position.

01:19:16.821 --> 01:19:18.871
All right, top speed, Ant-thony. Let's go!

01:19:29.861 --> 01:19:31.149
Proceeding to command position.

01:19:48.941 --> 01:19:50.547
I'll be right back, Ant-thony.

01:19:52.461 --> 01:19:54.421
All right, guys. I'm in position.

01:19:54.621 --> 01:19:56.181
I'm gonna signal the ants.

01:19:56.381 --> 01:19:58.670
No, no, no, no, no!

01:19:59.981 --> 01:20:01.109
Did you see that?

01:20:07.581 --> 01:20:09.021
Assume formation.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:11.021
All right, you cute little crazies,

01:20:11.221 --> 01:20:12.952
let's fry these servers!

01:20:25.181 --> 01:20:27.265
Let's go get 'em, buddy!

01:20:39.781 --> 01:20:40.661
<i>Servers are fried.</i>

01:20:40.861 --> 01:20:42.941
Data backup completely erased.

01:20:43.141 --> 01:20:44.747
Heading to the particle chamber.

01:20:51.261 --> 01:20:53.106
Hello, Dr. Cross.

01:20:57.061 --> 01:20:59.341
My associates have agreed
to your terms.

01:20:59.541 --> 01:21:00.581
Wonderful.

01:21:00.781 --> 01:21:03.501
Mr. Carson introduced me
to these fine gentlemen here.

01:21:03.701 --> 01:21:05.181
They're representatives of Hydra.

01:21:05.381 --> 01:21:06.581
They're not what they were.

01:21:06.781 --> 01:21:08.941
They're doing some interesting work.

01:21:09.141 --> 01:21:11.589
And I'm enjoying myself.

01:21:12.341 --> 01:21:14.381
You tried to hide
your technology from me.

01:21:14.581 --> 01:21:16.551
And now it's gonna blow up in your face.

01:21:20.461 --> 01:21:21.510
Wow.

01:21:22.181 --> 01:21:25.781
Wow! I mean, I saw that punch coming
a mile away,

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:27.941
but I just figured it'd
be all pathetic and weak.

01:21:28.141 --> 01:21:29.668
Well, you figured wrong.

01:21:30.861 --> 01:21:32.194
I know this van.

01:21:33.621 --> 01:21:34.784
Anybody home?

01:21:40.461 --> 01:21:41.624
All right, guys. I'm here.

01:21:46.221 --> 01:21:48.032
I'm setting the charges.

01:22:06.701 --> 01:22:09.912
Great job, guys.
I'll take it from here.

01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:21.629
Good boy, Ant-thony.

01:22:22.581 --> 01:22:23.584
Final position.

01:22:32.221 --> 01:22:34.381
Guys, how we looking on that laser grid?

01:22:34.581 --> 01:22:36.021
- Almost.
- No, you're not.

01:22:36.221 --> 01:22:37.703
- I'm getting close!
- No, you're not.

01:22:42.301 --> 01:22:43.861
San Francisco P.D.!

01:22:44.061 --> 01:22:45.064
Out of the van!

01:22:45.701 --> 01:22:46.541
I know you're in there!

01:22:46.741 --> 01:22:48.905
- Make it go faster.
- Dude, seriously.

01:22:54.621 --> 01:22:56.581
Ready to jump.
Do you read, Kurt?

01:22:56.781 --> 01:22:57.784
So close.

01:22:58.581 --> 01:22:59.861
- Okay, hold up! Wait a minute!
- Freeze!

01:23:00.061 --> 01:23:01.581
There was a black guy
that looked exactly like me

01:23:01.781 --> 01:23:03.581
who attacked us and put us
in the back of this disgusting van.

01:23:03.781 --> 01:23:05.141
- Get out of the van!
- Okay, I'm coming.

01:23:05.341 --> 01:23:07.021
Take it easy!

01:23:07.221 --> 01:23:09.191
No, I will not move! Go now!

01:23:11.341 --> 01:23:13.391
- Wait!
- What? What do you mean, "Wait"?

01:23:20.301 --> 01:23:21.304
Phew!

01:23:23.941 --> 01:23:24.944
What? What?

01:23:26.581 --> 01:23:27.869
Hey, little guy.

01:23:40.581 --> 01:23:43.581
I always suspected you had
a suit stored away somewhere.

01:23:43.781 --> 01:23:44.621
Which begs the question,

01:23:44.821 --> 01:23:46.861
who is the new Ant-Man?

01:23:47.061 --> 01:23:49.381
Who is the man that my beloved mentor

01:23:49.581 --> 01:23:51.472
trusted even more than me?

01:23:53.701 --> 01:23:55.990
Scott Lang.

01:23:57.221 --> 01:23:58.701
A martyr

01:23:58.901 --> 01:24:01.221
who took on the system
and paid the price,

01:24:01.421 --> 01:24:04.901
losing his family and his only daughter
in the process.

01:24:05.101 --> 01:24:08.346
Exactly your kind of guy, Hank!

01:24:09.341 --> 01:24:14.144
He escapes his jail cell
without leaving any clue as to how.

01:24:14.861 --> 01:24:18.310
And then he disappears magically,

01:24:19.501 --> 01:24:21.501
despite having no money to his name.

01:24:21.701 --> 01:24:24.388
And now he brings me the Ant-Man suit.

01:24:26.741 --> 01:24:30.381
The only thing that can rival my creation.

01:24:30.581 --> 01:24:33.901
Darren, don't do this.

01:24:34.101 --> 01:24:36.021
If you sell to these men,

01:24:36.221 --> 01:24:37.541
it's gonna be chaos.

01:24:37.741 --> 01:24:39.021
I already have.

01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:40.541
And for twice the price,

01:24:40.741 --> 01:24:42.661
thanks to you.

01:24:42.861 --> 01:24:46.101
It's not easy to successfully infiltrate
an Avengers facility.

01:24:46.301 --> 01:24:48.141
Thankfully, word travels fast.

01:24:48.341 --> 01:24:52.189
I'll sell them the Yellowjacket,
but I'm keeping the particle to myself.

01:24:53.221 --> 01:24:54.501
They don't run on diesel.

01:24:54.701 --> 01:24:57.593
If you want the fuel,
you'll have to come to me.

01:24:58.741 --> 01:25:00.421
What do you call the only man

01:25:00.621 --> 01:25:03.593
who can arm the most
powerful weapon in the world?

01:25:04.221 --> 01:25:06.741
The most powerful man in the world.

01:25:06.941 --> 01:25:08.341
You proud of me yet?

01:25:08.541 --> 01:25:11.461
You can stop this, Darren.
It's not too late.

01:25:11.661 --> 01:25:15.384
It's been too late for a long time now.

01:25:16.341 --> 01:25:18.391
Darren!

01:25:19.541 --> 01:25:20.501
What are you doing?

01:25:20.701 --> 01:25:23.781
He wasn't any more capable of
caring for you than he was for me.

01:25:23.981 --> 01:25:25.621
This is not who you are.

01:25:25.821 --> 01:25:28.633
It's the particles altering
your brain chemistry.

01:25:36.981 --> 01:25:39.031
Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:25:40.741 --> 01:25:43.428
You're right.
I have to be the one to do it.

01:25:46.021 --> 01:25:47.309
Here we go.

01:25:48.701 --> 01:25:51.912
Drop your gun.

01:25:54.501 --> 01:25:57.341
You know, I came to the house
the other night to kill him,

01:25:57.541 --> 01:25:58.501
but you were there.

01:25:58.701 --> 01:26:02.101
You're sick and I can help you.
Just put the gun down.

01:26:02.301 --> 01:26:03.583
I wasn't ready to kill you then,

01:26:05.341 --> 01:26:06.421
but I think I am now!

01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:08.621
Drop your gun now!

01:26:08.821 --> 01:26:12.191
You picked the wrong side, Hope.

01:26:24.421 --> 01:26:26.425
Dad!

01:26:35.141 --> 01:26:36.261
Hank, no.

01:26:36.461 --> 01:26:38.113
No, Hank.

01:26:38.701 --> 01:26:40.541
Hank? Listen, you're gonna be okay.

01:26:40.741 --> 01:26:42.823
All right? You're gonna be just fine.

01:26:43.781 --> 01:26:46.707
Take the suit off,
or I'll blow your brains out and peel it off.

01:27:12.541 --> 01:27:14.301
We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech.

01:27:14.501 --> 01:27:15.861
Request immediate backup!

01:27:16.061 --> 01:27:17.349
Go, go, go!

01:27:30.261 --> 01:27:32.021
Get me to the roof.

01:27:32.221 --> 01:27:33.341
And radio ahead.

01:27:33.541 --> 01:27:36.261
I want to make sure the helicopter
is ready to take off.

01:27:36.461 --> 01:27:37.381
You two,

01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:40.141
kill anything that comes out of that vault!

01:27:40.341 --> 01:27:43.552
Dad, can you move?

01:27:45.901 --> 01:27:47.314
We need to get him out of here.

01:27:48.621 --> 01:27:51.229
Go get that suit.

01:28:34.541 --> 01:28:35.501
Hey, Scotty.

01:28:35.701 --> 01:28:37.432
Hey, did I save your life?

01:28:38.581 --> 01:28:41.189
Scotty?

01:28:43.581 --> 01:28:45.061
Thank you, Luis.

01:28:45.261 --> 01:28:46.701
- Are we the good guys?
- Yeah.

01:28:46.901 --> 01:28:49.184
- We're the good guys, right?
- Yeah, we're the good guys.

01:28:49.701 --> 01:28:51.341
Feels kinda weird, you know.

01:28:51.541 --> 01:28:53.501
Yeah, but we're not done yet.

01:28:53.701 --> 01:28:55.785
Get out of here before this place blows!

01:29:02.461 --> 01:29:05.751
Damn it! That guy.

01:29:06.901 --> 01:29:09.031
Hey! We're getting out of here!

01:29:13.541 --> 01:29:14.461
The charges are set.

01:29:14.661 --> 01:29:16.541
We've gotta find a way out of here.
And fast.

01:29:16.741 --> 01:29:18.541
Don't worry.

01:29:18.741 --> 01:29:21.181
I'm not gonna die.

01:29:21.381 --> 01:29:22.828
And neither are you.

01:29:23.901 --> 01:29:26.429
It's not a keychain.

01:29:29.501 --> 01:29:32.473
It's total chaos in here!
Multiple shots fired!

01:29:43.261 --> 01:29:45.027
And there's a tank.

01:29:54.581 --> 01:29:56.153
A little help!

01:29:57.661 --> 01:29:58.789
I got it.

01:29:59.581 --> 01:30:01.028
We need a doctor!

01:30:02.341 --> 01:30:03.583
We've got him.

01:30:05.701 --> 01:30:07.353
Thank you.

01:30:08.661 --> 01:30:10.267
Let's go!

01:30:26.341 --> 01:30:27.708
Ant-thony!

01:30:41.021 --> 01:30:42.309
Go!

01:30:43.581 --> 01:30:44.863
You're gonna regret that.

01:30:55.101 --> 01:30:56.661
Wait a minute! Get out of that van!

01:30:56.861 --> 01:30:58.301
- What?
- Get out of that van!

01:30:58.501 --> 01:31:00.383
It's too loud, there's a tank.
I can't hear you!

01:31:01.461 --> 01:31:03.943
Hey! Hey!

01:31:08.741 --> 01:31:10.901
Are you crazy? Put the gun down!

01:31:11.101 --> 01:31:12.628
The windows!

01:31:17.101 --> 01:31:19.821
Did you think you could
stop the future with a heist?

01:31:20.021 --> 01:31:21.593
It was never just a heist!

01:31:43.781 --> 01:31:45.273
Put the gun down!

01:31:53.861 --> 01:31:55.991
Okay, I got him, I got him.
There he is! Go, go, go!

01:32:12.261 --> 01:32:14.311
We gotta set her down somewhere.

01:32:44.301 --> 01:32:46.541
I'm gonna disintegrate you!

01:32:46.741 --> 01:32:48.343
<i>Playing Disintegration
by the Cure.</i>

01:33:26.941 --> 01:33:28.024
Call 911!

01:33:46.341 --> 01:33:48.107
It's okay.

01:33:52.541 --> 01:33:54.511
Freeze! Put your hands up!
Get them up!

01:33:57.061 --> 01:33:57.941
Scott?

01:33:58.141 --> 01:33:59.463
Paxton, you have to listen to me!

01:34:27.741 --> 01:34:29.901
Paxton, turn around! Take me back!

01:34:30.101 --> 01:34:31.981
I am taking you back. To prison.

01:34:32.181 --> 01:34:34.541
There's something in that backyard
that needs to be destroyed.

01:34:34.741 --> 01:34:35.824
In the bug zapper. There...

01:34:37.621 --> 01:34:40.861
You need to desist right now!
Your delusions are out of hand.

01:34:41.061 --> 01:34:45.261
<i>All units, we have a 2-36
in progress at 840 Winter Street.</i>

01:34:45.461 --> 01:34:46.794
- Cassie!
- That's my house.

01:35:04.381 --> 01:35:05.669
Don't be scared.

01:35:06.661 --> 01:35:07.821
Paxton, let me help!

01:35:08.021 --> 01:35:09.901
- Don't move.
- Let me help!

01:35:10.101 --> 01:35:12.061
- Maggie! What's going on?
- He's got Cassie!

01:35:12.261 --> 01:35:13.701
- Who's got Cassie, honey?
- That thing.

01:35:13.901 --> 01:35:16.023
- Thing?
- I don't know! I don't know!

01:35:24.141 --> 01:35:25.827
Are you a monster?

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:29.385
Do I look like a monster?

01:35:30.421 --> 01:35:31.868
I want my daddy!

01:35:33.541 --> 01:35:34.954
I want your daddy, too.

01:35:38.701 --> 01:35:39.621
There you are.

01:35:39.821 --> 01:35:41.188
Daddy, is that you?

01:35:42.821 --> 01:35:43.824
Hi, peanut.

01:35:44.661 --> 01:35:46.984
Why don't you pick on
someone your own size?

01:36:00.261 --> 01:36:03.028
Now, where did you go, little guy?

01:36:08.061 --> 01:36:09.189
There you are.

01:36:13.141 --> 01:36:14.474
Not just me!

01:36:25.221 --> 01:36:26.463
Damn it!

01:36:27.181 --> 01:36:28.753
Go! Go!

01:37:22.461 --> 01:37:24.021
Scotty needs us,
you know what I'm saying?

01:37:24.221 --> 01:37:26.066
Ain't nothing gonna stop us.

01:37:28.781 --> 01:37:29.781
Back it up.

01:37:29.981 --> 01:37:31.861
- Back it up, slow.
- Yeah.

01:37:32.061 --> 01:37:33.381
- Back it up.
- Yeah.

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:35.028
- Back it up.
- Okay.

01:37:36.181 --> 01:37:37.741
- We just back it up, okay?
- That's it.

01:37:37.941 --> 01:37:39.181
- Back it up.
- That's right.

01:37:39.381 --> 01:37:42.061
- Backin' up?
- Yep, just backin' up.

01:37:42.261 --> 01:37:43.469
No, no. Just back it up.

01:37:50.181 --> 01:37:52.231
You insult me, Scott.

01:37:56.501 --> 01:38:00.303
Your very existence is insulting to me.

01:38:01.941 --> 01:38:05.504
You know, it'd be much easier to hit you
if you were bigger.

01:38:07.741 --> 01:38:09.029
Yeah, I agree.

01:38:30.661 --> 01:38:31.664
Cassie!

01:38:38.821 --> 01:38:42.430
I'm gonna show you
just how insignificant you are.

01:38:43.581 --> 01:38:46.029
Cassie! I'm coming!

01:38:58.821 --> 01:39:00.341
That's a messed-up looking dog.

01:39:00.541 --> 01:39:01.541
I'm gonna destroy

01:39:01.741 --> 01:39:03.313
everything you love.

01:39:04.901 --> 01:39:06.473
Freeze! S.F.P.D.

01:39:14.301 --> 01:39:15.634
I can't break through.

01:39:16.581 --> 01:39:18.631
It's titanium, you idiot!

01:39:24.781 --> 01:39:26.751
- Get her out of here.
- Come on.

01:39:27.901 --> 01:39:29.141
Sorry, sweetheart.

01:39:29.341 --> 01:39:31.661
You have to help Daddy
pay for his mistakes.

01:39:31.861 --> 01:39:33.061
- You stay behind me, okay?
- Okay.

01:39:33.261 --> 01:39:34.264
Stay behind me.

01:39:35.661 --> 01:39:38.541
I'm gonna have to shrink
between the molecules to get in there.

01:39:38.741 --> 01:39:40.791
Get away from us!

01:39:42.661 --> 01:39:43.541
Daddy, help!

01:39:43.741 --> 01:39:45.347
I love you, Cassie.

01:40:15.101 --> 01:40:16.548
Daddy, where are you?

01:40:18.181 --> 01:40:19.981
<i>You could go subatomic.</i>

01:40:20.181 --> 01:40:21.423
<i>You could go subatomic.</i>

01:40:22.461 --> 01:40:23.703
Oh, no.

01:40:35.621 --> 01:40:38.101
<i>You would enter a reality</i>

01:40:38.301 --> 01:40:42.069
<i>where all concepts of time and space...</i>

01:40:42.541 --> 01:40:46.832
<i>All concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.</i>

01:40:48.821 --> 01:40:52.748
<i>...all concepts of time and space
become irrelevant.</i>

01:40:56.821 --> 01:40:58.905
<i>Come back, Daddy!</i>

01:40:59.701 --> 01:41:06.268
<i>...as you shrink for all eternity.</i>

01:41:07.821 --> 01:41:10.508
<i>Everything that you know</i>

01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:14.192
<i>and love,</i>

01:41:15.221 --> 01:41:17.146
<i>gone forever.</i>

01:41:17.581 --> 01:41:19.153
<i>Daddy, where are you?</i>

01:41:37.341 --> 01:41:38.424
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.708
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:41:43.901 --> 01:41:45.712
<i>- Daddy!</i>
- Cassie.

01:41:53.381 --> 01:41:54.953
<i>Come back, Daddy!</i>

01:41:59.061 --> 01:42:01.714
<i>Do not screw with the regulator!</i>

01:42:32.261 --> 01:42:34.152
Daddy!

01:42:37.341 --> 01:42:38.913
I love you so much.

01:42:39.621 --> 01:42:40.784
I love you, too.

01:42:41.461 --> 01:42:42.544
So much.

01:42:46.941 --> 01:42:48.583
You know, there's a big hole in the roof.

01:42:51.781 --> 01:42:52.944
Sorry.

01:42:55.741 --> 01:42:57.711
- Is she all right?
- Yeah, she's fine.

01:42:59.781 --> 01:43:00.784
Mommy!

01:43:03.661 --> 01:43:05.267
She's fine, she's fine.

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:16.193
<i>Scott, please.</i>

01:43:16.861 --> 01:43:18.621
You don't remember anything?

01:43:18.821 --> 01:43:19.901
Hank. I don't.

01:43:20.101 --> 01:43:22.470
There must be something else.

01:43:24.181 --> 01:43:27.181
Well, I suppose the human mind

01:43:27.381 --> 01:43:30.068
just can't comprehend the experience,

01:43:32.141 --> 01:43:33.474
but you made it.

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:35.793
You went in,

01:43:37.141 --> 01:43:38.872
and you got out.

01:43:41.061 --> 01:43:42.667
It's amazing.

01:43:43.341 --> 01:43:44.981
Scott,

01:43:45.181 --> 01:43:47.106
I'll walk you out.

01:43:51.061 --> 01:43:52.588
Get some rest.

01:44:00.821 --> 01:44:03.224
Is it possible?

01:44:21.101 --> 01:44:22.021
When did this happen?

01:44:22.221 --> 01:44:23.221
Nothing's happening.

01:44:23.421 --> 01:44:25.541
Whoa. Hold on.
Something's kind of happening.

01:44:25.741 --> 01:44:27.661
Well, if that's the case,

01:44:27.861 --> 01:44:29.388
shoot me again.

01:44:29.741 --> 01:44:32.221
Yeah. I don't know what you were doing,
grabbing and kissing me like that.

01:44:32.421 --> 01:44:34.221
I'm a little surprised myself.

01:44:34.421 --> 01:44:36.661
I have to get somewhere.
I'll see you later, Hank.

01:44:36.861 --> 01:44:38.353
Really, Hope.

01:44:39.181 --> 01:44:40.548
- Scott.
- Yeah?

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:42.872
- You're full of shit.
- Oh, yeah.

01:44:44.301 --> 01:44:46.101
Scott,
I met with my captain today.

01:44:46.301 --> 01:44:48.988
He wanted a report on the night
that you got out of jail.

01:44:49.621 --> 01:44:51.063
Something happened with the cameras.

01:44:51.781 --> 01:44:53.990
Some circuits got fried.

01:44:55.101 --> 01:44:57.221
But I told him that
you were processed correctly.

01:44:57.421 --> 01:44:58.421
Really?

01:44:58.621 --> 01:45:00.068
Well, yeah.

01:45:01.861 --> 01:45:04.661
Can't be sending Cassie's dad
back to jail on a technical glitch, right?

01:45:04.861 --> 01:45:06.701
Thank you, Paxton.

01:45:06.901 --> 01:45:08.348
I'm blown away.

01:45:09.141 --> 01:45:10.821
Thank you for everything
you do for Cassie.

01:45:11.021 --> 01:45:13.071
Well, that's my pleasure.

01:45:14.301 --> 01:45:17.432
But, no. This one, I did for you.

01:45:19.461 --> 01:45:20.741
- This is awkward.
- Yeah.

01:45:20.941 --> 01:45:22.621
Yeah.

01:45:22.821 --> 01:45:24.181
I mean, what do we even talk about
after all of that?

01:45:24.381 --> 01:45:25.621
- Oh, I know.
- What?

01:45:25.821 --> 01:45:28.261
- I did my first cartwheel today.
- What?

01:45:28.461 --> 01:45:30.941
Yeah. She has been practicing all week.

01:45:31.141 --> 01:45:32.421
But today was the magic day.

01:45:32.621 --> 01:45:33.903
I recorded it on my phone. Here.

01:45:35.341 --> 01:45:37.581
No, that can't be Cassie.
That's not you.

01:45:37.781 --> 01:45:39.221
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah, it is.

01:45:39.421 --> 01:45:41.461
This is a professional gymnast.
There is no way that's you.

01:45:41.661 --> 01:45:42.789
Yeah, that's her.

01:45:43.741 --> 01:45:45.313
Good boy.

01:45:47.221 --> 01:45:49.954
Sweetie, that's pretty amazing, peanut.

01:45:52.901 --> 01:45:53.904
Sorry.

01:45:55.581 --> 01:45:57.312
It's work.

01:45:57.941 --> 01:45:59.229
Yeah.

01:46:00.941 --> 01:46:01.781
All right.

01:46:01.981 --> 01:46:03.621
Here's the deal. Just give me the facts.

01:46:03.821 --> 01:46:05.021
Just the facts. Only the facts.

01:46:05.221 --> 01:46:08.981
Breathe. Focus. Keep it simple.

01:46:09.181 --> 01:46:10.741
No, no, no. No doubt, no doubt. Okay.

01:46:10.941 --> 01:46:13.181
So, I'm at this art museum
with my cousin Ignacio, right?

01:46:13.381 --> 01:46:15.461
<i>And there was this, like,
abstract expressionism exhibit.</i>

01:46:15.661 --> 01:46:17.781
<i>But you know me, I'm more
like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right?</i>

01:46:17.981 --> 01:46:20.581
<i>But there was this one Rothko
that was sublime, bro! Oh, my God!</i>

01:46:20.781 --> 01:46:22.781
- Luis.
- Okay, sorry. Sorry.

01:46:22.981 --> 01:46:24.861
You know, I just get excited and stuff.

01:46:25.061 --> 01:46:26.901
<i>But anyway, Ignacio tells me,</i>

01:46:27.101 --> 01:46:30.621
<i>"Yo, I met this crazy-fine writer chick
at the Spot last night. Like fine-fine.</i>

01:46:30.821 --> 01:46:33.061
<i>"Like crazy-stupid fine." And he
goes up to the bartender and goes,</i>

01:46:33.261 --> 01:46:34.821
<i>"Look at the girl I'm with.
You know what I'm sayin'?</i>

01:46:35.021 --> 01:46:36.181
<i>"She's crazy-stupid fine, right?"</i>

01:46:36.381 --> 01:46:38.901
<i>The bartender's all like,
"Yeah, crazy-stupid fine."</i>

01:46:39.101 --> 01:46:40.901
<i>So this writer chick tells Ignacio,</i>

01:46:41.101 --> 01:46:43.781
<i>"Yo, I'm like a boss
in the world of guerrilla journalism,</i>

01:46:43.981 --> 01:46:45.581
<i>"and I got mad connects
with the peeps behind the curtains,</i>

01:46:45.781 --> 01:46:46.621
<i>"you know what I'm saying?"</i>

01:46:46.821 --> 01:46:48.221
<i>Ignacio's like, "For real?"</i>

01:46:48.421 --> 01:46:51.261
<i>And she's like, "Yeah, you know what,
I can't tell you who my contact is,</i>

01:46:51.461 --> 01:46:52.741
<i>"because he works with the Avengers."</i>

01:46:52.941 --> 01:46:54.101
Oh, no.

01:46:54.301 --> 01:46:56.581
Yeah, and this dude sounds
like a badass, man.

01:46:56.781 --> 01:46:57.821
Like, he comes up to her and says,

01:46:58.021 --> 01:46:59.941
<i>"Yo, I'm looking for this dude
who's new on the scene,</i>

01:47:00.141 --> 01:47:01.141
<i>"who's flashing his fresh tack,</i>

01:47:01.341 --> 01:47:03.781
<i>"who's got, like, bomb moves, right?
Who you got?"</i>

01:47:03.981 --> 01:47:06.981
<i>And she's like, "Well, we got everything
nowadays. We got a guy who jumps.</i>

01:47:07.181 --> 01:47:09.141
<i>"We got a guy who swings,
we got a guy who crawls up the walls.</i>

01:47:09.341 --> 01:47:10.941
<i>"You gotta be more specific."</i>

01:47:11.141 --> 01:47:12.861
<i>And he's like,
"I'm looking for a guy that shrinks."</i>

01:47:13.061 --> 01:47:16.381
And I'm, like, "Damn!" I got all nervous
'cause I'd keep mad secrets for you, bro.

01:47:16.581 --> 01:47:17.501
So I asked Ignacio,

01:47:17.701 --> 01:47:19.621
<i>"Did the badass tell
the stupid-fine writer chick</i>

01:47:19.821 --> 01:47:21.941
"to tell you to tell me,
because I'm tight with Ant-Man,

01:47:22.141 --> 01:47:23.383
"that he's looking for him?"

01:47:24.021 --> 01:47:26.594
And? What'd he say?

01:47:29.861 --> 01:47:31.308
He said, "Yes."

01:49:26.381 --> 01:49:28.670
There's something I want to show you.

01:49:30.861 --> 01:49:34.151
I realized you can't destroy power.

01:49:35.821 --> 01:49:39.748
All you can do is make sure
that it's in the right hands.

01:49:46.461 --> 01:49:48.461
This is an advanced prototype

01:49:48.661 --> 01:49:51.553
that your mother and I
worked on together.

01:49:52.941 --> 01:49:55.674
She never got to use it.

01:49:56.301 --> 01:50:00.706
But now I realize that we were...
We were working on it for you.

01:50:07.341 --> 01:50:09.869
Maybe it's time we finished it.

01:50:16.501 --> 01:50:18.904
It's about damn time.

01:56:19.221 --> 01:56:20.634
<i>Hey, Cap!</i>

01:56:33.821 --> 01:56:37.221
This would have been a lot easier
a week ago.

01:56:37.421 --> 01:56:39.221
- If we call Tony...
- He won't believe us.

01:56:39.421 --> 01:56:40.301
Even if he did...

01:56:40.501 --> 01:56:42.232
Who knows if the Accords
will let him help.

01:56:43.781 --> 01:56:45.308
We're on our own.

01:56:46.701 --> 01:56:48.034
Maybe not.

01:56:50.301 --> 01:56:51.748
I know a guy.
