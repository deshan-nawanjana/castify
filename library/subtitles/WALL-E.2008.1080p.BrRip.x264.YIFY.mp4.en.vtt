Uh, no. John.

00:41:03.857 --> 00:41:05.065
EVE!

00:41:05.483 --> 00:41:06.609
Bye, WALL-E.

00:41:12.991 --> 00:41:16.493
"A" is for Axiom,
your home sweet home.

00:41:16.578 --> 00:41:20.164
"B" is for Buy N Large,
your very best friend.

00:41:21.207 --> 00:41:22.625
Mmm!

00:41:22.709 --> 00:41:25.377
Time for lunch in a cup.

00:41:31.551 --> 00:41:32.801
Feel beautiful.

00:41:32.886 --> 00:41:34.470
- It's the new you. Stunning.
- You look great.

00:41:34.554 --> 00:41:36.055
- I know, honey. Men.
- Men.

00:41:36.139 --> 00:41:39.141
Attention, Axiom shoppers.
Try blue.

00:41:39.225 --> 00:41:40.893
It's the new red.

00:41:41.394 --> 00:41:42.394
Ooh!

00:41:44.814 --> 00:41:46.190
Love blue.

00:41:48.234 --> 00:41:49.193
Date?

00:41:49.277 --> 00:41:50.527
Don't get me started
on the date.

00:41:50.612 --> 00:41:54.239
Every holo-date I have been on
has been a virtual disaster.

00:41:54.324 --> 00:41:59.161
If I could just meet one,
one who wasn't so superficial.

00:41:59.245 --> 00:42:01.080
There are no good men out there.

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:04.333

Honestly, it's the one thing
I get to do on this ship.

00:45:57.984 --> 00:46:00.152
Well, good morning, everybody,

00:46:00.236 --> 00:46:05.908
and welcome to day 255,642
aboard the Axiom.

00:46:05.992 --> 00:46:10.204
As always, the weather is a balmy
72 degrees and sunny and...

00:46:10.497 --> 00:46:14.792
Oh, I see the ship's log is showing
that today is our 700th anniversary

00:46:14.876 --> 00:46:16.377
of our five-year cruise.

00:46:16.461 --> 00:46:21.006
Well, I'm sure our forefathers would
be proud to know that 700 years later

00:46:21.091 --> 00:46:24.802
we'd be doing the exact same thing
they were doing.

If you are seeing this,

00:47:23.778 --> 00:47:27.364
that means your
Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator,

00:47:27.449 --> 00:47:30.826
or EVE probe, has returned from Earth

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:35.205
with a confirmed specimen
of ongoing photosynthesis.

00:47:35.290 --> 00:47:39.084
That's right. It means it's time
to go back home.

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:42.087
Home? We're going back?

00:47:42.505 --> 00:47:45.674
Now that Earth has been restored
to a life-sustaining status,

00:47:45.759 --> 00:47:49.345
by golly,
we can begin "Operation Re-colonize".

00:48:04.110 --> 00:48:09.031
and the Axiom will immediately
navigate your return to Earth.

- It's that easy.
- Huh!

00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:13.661

around the ship's jogging track

00:48:22.963 --> 00:48:25.047
will get you back in shape in no time.

00:48:25.131 --> 00:48:26.173
We have a jogging track?

Probe's memory is faulty.

- Well, false alarm!

Oh.

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.290
- Hey! Hey! That's what's-his-name!
- Hey! What the...

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:50.668
- Look! Look at that.
- Huh? What?

01:00:51.211 --> 01:00:56.173
Hey. I know that guy. It's, uh, WALL-E.

01:00:56.257 --> 01:01:00.094
- Hey, WALL-E! It's your buddy John.
- Hi, WALL-E!

01:01:05.892 --> 01:01:09.061
Hi.

01:01:19.239 --> 01:01:21.615
Define: "hoedown".

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:23.617
Hoedown,
a social gathering

01:01:23.702 --> 01:01:25.911
at which lively dancing
would take place.

01:01:26.830 --> 01:01:30.582
Auto, Earth is amazing!
These are called "farms".

01:01:30.667 --> 01:01:34.003
Humans would put seeds
in the ground, pour water on them,

01:01:34.087 --> 01:01:36.213
and they grow food, like pizza.

01:01:36.298 --> 01:01:38.048
Good night, Captain.

01:01:42.804 --> 01:01:44.722
Psst! Computer.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.266
Define: "dancing".

01:01:47.767 --> 01:01:51.687
Dancing, a series of
movements involving two partners

01:01:51.771 --> 01:01:55.441
where speed and rhythm
match harmoniously with music.

01:01:57.527 --> 01:01:58.944
Uh-huh. Uh...

01:02:01.656 --> 01:02:02.948
EVE.

01:02:03.575 --> 01:02:04.658
Home.

01:02:12.709 --> 01:02:13.709
Uh-oh.

01:02:15.045 --> 01:02:19.173
The "Lido Deck" is now closing.
The "Lido Deck" is now closing.

01:02:22.302 --> 01:02:24.136
- Stop that.
- Make me.

01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.804
I didn't know we had a pool.

01:02:26.139 --> 01:02:28.307
No splashing. No diving.

01:02:28.892 --> 01:02:31.310
- Oh, go on.
- No splashing. No...

01:03:00.173 --> 01:03:01.215
EVE.

01:03:25.532 --> 01:03:26.865
Prepare for landing.

01:03:29.995 --> 01:03:31.078
"We're here, everybody."

01:03:31.162 --> 01:03:34.623
"Yay, Captain! Captain, we're home!
It's so beautiful!"

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:37.710
"No. It's nothing.
I was pleased to do this."

01:03:37.794 --> 01:03:39.795
"It's all about you people.
It's not about me."

01:03:45.677 --> 01:03:47.219
How?

01:03:47.304 --> 01:03:49.054
How did you find it?

01:03:53.226 --> 01:03:56.478
We can go back home!
For the first time!

01:03:56.813 --> 01:03:58.355
- What's it like now?
- Oh!

01:03:58.440 --> 01:04:01.275
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
I want to see for myself.

01:04:10.076 --> 01:04:12.578
Wait. That doesn't look like Earth.

01:04:15.498 --> 01:04:17.333
Where's the blue sky?

01:04:27.594 --> 01:04:29.428
Where's the grass?

There you go, little guy.

01:06:45.649 --> 01:06:48.484
You came a long way
for a drink of water.

01:06:48.568 --> 01:06:51.320
Just needed someone
to look after you, that's...

01:07:04.793 --> 01:07:06.543
We have to go back.

01:07:08.630 --> 01:07:11.465
- Auto, come down here.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:07:12.008 --> 01:07:13.008
WALL-E.

01:07:14.511 --> 01:07:15.719
WALL-E.

01:07:18.515 --> 01:07:21.350
Auto, EVE found the plant.
Fire up the holo-detector.

01:07:21.434 --> 01:07:24.186
Not necessary, Captain.
You may give it to me.

01:07:24.270 --> 01:07:27.731
- You know what? I should do it myself.
- Captain.

01:07:28.942 --> 01:07:32.194
Sir, I insist you give me the plant.

01:07:32.279 --> 01:07:35.739
- Auto, get out of my way.
- We cannot go home.

01:07:35.824 --> 01:07:39.618
- What are you talking about? Why not?
- That is classified, Captain.

01:07:39.703 --> 01:07:42.037
- Give me the plant.
- What do you mean, "classified"?

01:07:42.122 --> 01:07:43.580
You don't keep a secret
from the captain.

01:07:43.665 --> 01:07:44.790
Give me the plant.

01:07:44.874 --> 01:07:47.209
- Tell me what's classified.
- The plant.

01:07:47.294 --> 01:07:49.169
Tell me, Auto! That's an order.

01:07:52.966 --> 01:07:54.466
Aye, aye, sir.

01:07:58.346 --> 01:08:03.726

Hey, there, autopilots.
Got some bad news.

01:08:10.650 --> 01:08:11.817
Um...

01:08:12.986 --> 01:08:14.612
Operation Cleanup has,

01:08:15.447 --> 01:08:16.947
well, failed.

01:08:17.699 --> 01:08:20.576
Wouldn't you know, rising
toxicity levels have made life

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:22.411
unsustainable on Earth.

01:08:22.495 --> 01:08:24.496
"Unsustainable"? What?

01:08:25.248 --> 01:08:28.626
Darn it all, we're going to have
to cancel "Operation Re-colonize".

01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:29.752
So,

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.254
just stay the course.

01:08:32.339 --> 01:08:33.422
Um...

01:08:33.506 --> 01:08:35.549
Rather than try and fix this problem,

01:08:35.634 --> 01:08:38.927
it'll just be easier
for everyone to remain in space.

01:08:39.012 --> 01:08:40.220
"Easier"?

01:08:40.305 --> 01:08:41.930
- Mr. President?
- I think...

01:08:42.015 --> 01:08:42.973
- Huh?
- Sir, time to go.

01:08:43.058 --> 01:08:47.603
Okay. I'm giving
Override Directive A113.

01:08:47.687 --> 01:08:50.230
Go to full autopilot.

01:08:50.357 --> 01:08:53.776
Take control of everything,
and do not return to Earth.

01:08:53.860 --> 01:08:56.070
Repeat, do not return to Earth.

01:08:56.196 --> 01:08:57.696
Let's get
the heck out of here.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.453
Now, the plant.

01:09:04.537 --> 01:09:06.497
No. Wait a minute.

01:09:06.581 --> 01:09:08.958
Computer, when was that message
sent out to the Axiom?

01:09:09.042 --> 01:09:11.502
Message received
in the year 2110.

01:09:11.586 --> 01:09:15.005
That's... That's nearly 700 years ago!

01:09:15.090 --> 01:09:18.133
Auto, things have changed!
We've got to go back.

01:09:18.218 --> 01:09:20.928
Sir, orders are: "Do not return to Earth."

01:09:21.012 --> 01:09:25.975
But life is sustainable now.
Look at this plant. Green and growing.

01:09:26.059 --> 01:09:29.395
- It's living proof he was wrong.
- Irrelevant, Captain.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:33.482
What? It's completely relevant!
Out there is our home.

01:09:33.566 --> 01:09:34.858
Home, Auto.

01:09:34.943 --> 01:09:38.696
And it's in trouble.
I can't just sit here and do nothing.

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:40.114
That's all I've ever done.

01:09:40.198 --> 01:09:43.492
That's all anyone on this blasted ship
has ever done. Nothing!

01:09:43.576 --> 01:09:45.953
On the Axiom you will survive.

01:09:46.037 --> 01:09:50.749
- I don't want to survive. I want to live!
- Must follow my directive.

01:10:08.810 --> 01:10:11.353
I'm the captain of the Axiom.

01:10:11.438 --> 01:10:14.106
We are going home today.

01:10:19.779 --> 01:10:20.946

Hey! That's not...

01:10:23.783 --> 01:10:26.410
This is mutiny! EVE, arrest him.

01:10:32.626 --> 01:10:36.503
EVE, you are to put this plant
straight in the holo-detector.

01:10:37.172 --> 01:10:38.213
No!

01:17:26.539 --> 01:17:27.498
The plant!

01:17:31.753 --> 01:17:33.754
We'll see who's powerless now.

01:17:39.719 --> 01:17:42.221
Testing, testing.
Is this thing on?

01:17:43.348 --> 01:17:47.726
This is the captain.
I am locked in my room.

01:17:47.811 --> 01:17:51.355
EVE, WALL-E,
bring the plant to the "Lido Deck".

01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:54.817
I'll have activated the holo-detector.
Now, hurry.

01:17:54.901 --> 01:17:57.653
- Auto's probably going to cut me off...
- Halt.

01:17:58.321 --> 01:17:59.321
Ah!

01:18:00.907 --> 01:18:02.074
Halt.

01:18:02.450 --> 01:18:03.659
Oh, my.

01:18:05.161 --> 01:18:06.328
Clear.

01:18:08.039 --> 01:18:09.081
Oh!

01:18:11.376 --> 01:18:12.418
Halt, halt.

01:18:21.052 --> 01:18:23.429
- Look what I got, Auto.
- Not possible.

01:18:23.513 --> 01:18:27.057
That's right. The plant.

01:18:27.142 --> 01:18:29.935
You want it? Come and get it, blinky.

01:18:30.812 --> 01:18:31.854
No.
