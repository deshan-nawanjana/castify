I just wanted really quickly
to say thank you so much for coming

00:09:36.158 --> 00:09:38.286
-Okay?
-Oh, I wish you wouldn’t.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.079
-I’m coming in.
-[groaning]

00:09:40.913 --> 00:09:41.872
Hey.

00:09:42.999 --> 00:09:44.125
How are you?

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:47.587
-You dying in here?
-I’m...

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:49.422
I’m... so good.

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:51.173
You hit the open bar too hard.

00:09:51.257 --> 00:09:52.883
You think this is about...

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.969
drinking?

00:09:55.052 --> 00:09:57.263
This was about...

00:09:57.972 --> 00:09:59.515
food poisoning.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:00.600
Taquitos.

00:10:02.727 --> 00:10:04.395
Or the seven-layer dip.

00:10:04.478 --> 00:10:06.814
-Why so many layers? You don’t need seven.
-[knocking]

00:10:07.815 --> 00:10:09.984
-Ethan.
-Noah. How you feeling, buddy?

00:10:10.067 --> 00:10:13.195
Oh, so good. I’m so glad he’s here now.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:15.615
Got you a Vitaminwater, some saltines.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:19.368
I got Pepto chewables in the glove box.
Let’s get this stuff in your system.

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.579
Mmm, yeah. Thank you.

00:10:21.662 --> 00:10:22.622
You are a peach.

00:10:22.705 --> 00:10:25.249
Oh. What are these, crackers?

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.209
Mm-mm-mmm. Mmm!

00:10:27.293 --> 00:10:28.794
-Feel better already.
-Awesome.

00:10:28.878 --> 00:10:30.880
Let me know if you need anything else.

00:10:30.963 --> 00:10:33.507
-Baby, by the way, that speech?
-Yeah?

00:10:33.591 --> 00:10:34.759
-It was beautiful.
-Thank you.

00:10:34.842 --> 00:10:36.969
-Everybody in the room was so moved.
-I was so nervous.

00:10:37.053 --> 00:10:39.347
-I love you so much.
-I love you.

00:10:39.430 --> 00:10:41.223
-[Noah clears throat]
-[crunching]

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:45.186
[chuckles]

00:10:45.269 --> 00:10:48.564
Also, my parents want to team up for
that Skype call whenever we have a chance.

00:10:48.648 --> 00:10:50.775
So, um, just meet me at the laptop?

00:10:50.858 --> 00:10:52.568
-Yes. I’ll be right there.
-Okay.

00:10:52.652 --> 00:10:54.654
-Feel better. Okay?
-Mm-hmm.

00:10:54.737 --> 00:10:56.364
Keep your head up.

00:10:56.447 --> 00:10:57.490
Okay.

00:10:58.532 --> 00:11:00.910
You wanna go
maybe walk around a little bit?

00:11:00.993 --> 00:11:03.746
-Just really slowly. Careful, careful.
-I’m fine.

00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:05.748
-Okay. Okay.
-These aren’t good.

00:11:05.831 --> 00:11:07.458
-Candid.
-[shutter clicks]

00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:09.043
That’s a candid.

00:11:09.126 --> 00:11:10.836
-Candid.
-[shutter clicks]

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:13.923
-Hey, Carrie.
-Hey, hon.

00:11:14.006 --> 00:11:16.133
Noah. Haven’t seen you in forever.

00:11:16.217 --> 00:11:18.594
-Hey, Carrie.
-I’ve got a shoot tomorrow morning.

00:11:18.677 --> 00:11:20.888
So I was wondering,
cool if I can leave a little early?

00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:24.892
Maybe you can take Noah home.
He’s a little-- He shouldn’t be driving.

00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:26.977
-I’m fine.
-Candid.

00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:30.648
You don’t look fine. You look like shit.

00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:33.734
You know, uh, honestly,
I-I’ll take an Uber.

00:11:33.818 --> 00:11:35.361
-Cool.
-[Ethan] Hey, Avery!

00:11:35.444 --> 00:11:37.238
Oh. Yeah. One second.

00:11:37.321 --> 00:11:39.240
-Um, really? Are you sure?
-[Noah sighs]

00:11:39.323 --> 00:11:41.200
Yeah. I-I’m actually not--

00:11:41.283 --> 00:11:43.536
Feel better, okay? Thank you. Bye, Carrie.

00:11:43.619 --> 00:11:44.912
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:11:48.457 --> 00:11:51.377
Ooh. That had my Uber on it.

00:11:51.877 --> 00:11:53.462
You really are a mess.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:55.548
-[burps]
-All right, fine. Let’s go.

00:11:58.342 --> 00:12:01.053
Oh, they’re so beautiful. [sighs]

00:12:03.097 --> 00:12:04.724
-[kisses]
-[Carrie] Let’s go, train wreck.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:06.100
Mm-hmm.

00:12:07.059 --> 00:12:10.104
-[Noah groaning]
-You stole an Avery-Ethan plate? You dork.

00:12:10.187 --> 00:12:12.982
-Candid!
-You delete that. Okay?

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.942
Don’t want any evidence
that this ever happened.

00:12:15.025 --> 00:12:17.236
Nope. Sorry.

00:12:17.319 --> 00:12:20.448
I photograph weddings for a living.
Capturing misery and regret is what I do.

00:12:20.531 --> 00:12:22.992
-Perfect.
-What is your deal tonight anyway?

00:12:23.075 --> 00:12:26.412
It’s kind of a long story,
so I’d rather not get into it.

00:12:26.495 --> 00:12:27.496
Yeah, okay. Cool.

00:12:28.998 --> 00:12:30.749
Oh, you don’t want to hear it?

00:12:31.834 --> 00:12:34.170
-Yeah, ’cause I don’t want to tell you.
-Okay.

00:12:37.465 --> 00:12:39.008
[exhales]

00:12:39.091 --> 00:12:42.094
[groaning]

00:12:48.142 --> 00:12:49.810
Fine. I’ll tell you.

00:12:49.894 --> 00:12:51.270
All right?

00:12:51.353 --> 00:12:53.731
Frickin’ drag it out of me, why don’t you?

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.318
It has to do with the fact that I’m...

00:12:59.361 --> 00:13:00.946
in love with Avery.

00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.031
Are you serious?

00:13:02.114 --> 00:13:04.867
Why would you go to a party
celebrating their engagement then?

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:07.328
I guess I just wanted to prove
that I could do it,

00:13:07.411 --> 00:13:11.624
that I’m not gonna spend my life obsessed
over the fact I missed my shot with her.

00:13:11.707 --> 00:13:14.376
-You’re doing great with that so far.
-You know what, Carrie?

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:15.628
I am.

00:13:15.711 --> 00:13:18.088
I am, considering the facts,

00:13:18.172 --> 00:13:21.217
and I’ll be doing even more better
when I find my--

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:23.135
-Dignity?
-Oop!

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.845
Oh!

00:13:24.929 --> 00:13:26.472
Jack Daniel’s.

00:13:26.555 --> 00:13:29.141
-Okay.
-The nectar of the gods.

00:13:29.225 --> 00:13:32.686
You’re a real sad sack of shit right now.

00:13:35.397 --> 00:13:37.191
Can I tell you a story?

00:13:37.274 --> 00:13:41.278
Has to do with when Avery and I first met.

00:13:41.362 --> 00:13:43.364
Just give me the abridged version.

00:13:44.114 --> 00:13:47.618
It all started three years
and one day ago.

00:13:47.701 --> 00:13:50.371
<i>The year was 2014.</i>

00:13:50.454 --> 00:13:53.332
<i>A time filled with hope and dreams.</i>

00:13:53.415 --> 00:13:56.293
<i>I can still remember the exact pitch</i>
<i>of her laugh.</i>

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:59.630
-[laughing]
-[audio slows down]

00:13:59.713 --> 00:14:02.967
-[Carrie] <i>That’s not how it happened.</i>
-[Noah] <i>I think you’re mistaken.</i>

00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:04.885
[Carrie] <i>No, I was at that party.</i>

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.845
<i>I was just... preoccupied.</i>

00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:08.639
<i>Wait. Where are we?</i>

00:14:08.722 --> 00:14:11.892
We are at my home, sister.

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.520
No, this is a bar. I’m not your--

00:14:14.603 --> 00:14:16.188
-Oh, I’m dr--
-Noah, get back in.

00:14:16.272 --> 00:14:17.856
-[gasps]
-Oh!

00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:21.318
[Noah groaning]

00:14:21.402 --> 00:14:23.195
-Je--
-You okay?

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:25.364
-I’m fine.
-Jesus Christ.

00:14:25.447 --> 00:14:28.409
-No, I’m not Jesus Christ, I’m Noah.
-Oh. Okay.

00:14:28.492 --> 00:14:31.996
-Get in the truck.
-No, I need to keep my buzz going.

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.247
Get-- Oh!

00:14:33.330 --> 00:14:35.207
-I’ll take it.
-Seriously?

00:14:35.291 --> 00:14:38.085
-[piano jazz playing]
-[Carrie] Think you should sit down.

00:14:38.168 --> 00:14:39.920
Sorry. So sorry.

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:42.172
-There’s my friend Max.
-Noah!

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:45.467
Oh, my God, you are drunk.
Gotta get you some help. Excuse me.

00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:48.846
Can we get some ginger whiskey,
a blueberry Red Bull, and who is this?

00:14:48.929 --> 00:14:51.891
You didn’t pick up an escort, did you?
You are very lovely.

00:14:51.974 --> 00:14:54.101
-Hey, I’m Max.
-And I’m leaving.

00:14:54.184 --> 00:14:56.353
I have a photo shoot
in Lafayette Park tomorrow morning.

00:14:56.437 --> 00:14:59.940
That’s where I take my wedding photos.
’Cause I am a photographer, not an escort.

00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:03.777
What a coincidence, ’cause my office
actually overlooks that park.

00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:06.697
Oh, yeah! That big dumb building full
of douche bags.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:08.741
Yeah. I’m the vice president
of the douche bags.

00:15:08.824 --> 00:15:11.702
-You’re obviously in great hands.
-No, no, no, no, no.

00:15:11.785 --> 00:15:13.871
You gotta hear the rest of the story.

00:15:13.954 --> 00:15:17.666
’Cause this is the part
that gets truly tragic.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.045
You know when you are about
to fulfill your destiny?

00:15:21.128 --> 00:15:24.798
<i>I waited too long, and then I got hugged.</i>

00:15:24.882 --> 00:15:29.887
[opera tenor singing “Pagliacci”]

00:15:31.472 --> 00:15:33.557
-You’re so awesome.
-Mmm.

00:15:33.641 --> 00:15:36.435
-[machine gun fire]
-[men screaming, grunting]

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.440
Oh, this is so nice to have
a good guy friend, I can’t even tell you.

00:15:41.523 --> 00:15:42.441
[groans]

00:15:42.524 --> 00:15:45.527
[singing continues]

00:15:48.447 --> 00:15:50.449
[Noah] <i>I left never knowing</i>
<i>what went wrong.</i>

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:52.117
-Bye!
-Bye.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:55.496
<i>But I figured I would at least</i>
<i>get a second chance with her.</i>

00:15:56.413 --> 00:15:57.790
Until fate...

00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:01.794
kicked me in my ball sack
the very next day

00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:03.587
when she met Ethan.

00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:06.507
[hooves clopping]

00:16:06.590 --> 00:16:07.633
Can I help you with that?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.102
[Noah] <i>And you know why</i>
<i>she needed more cereal?</i>

00:16:18.185 --> 00:16:22.022
Because I ate all of her Cookie Crisp.

00:16:22.106 --> 00:16:25.776
Like a... chubby, nine-year-old slob.

00:16:25.859 --> 00:16:29.530
Wow. Your mental recollection
of that moment feels super-accurate.

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:32.157
-Ethan has nothing on you.
-He kinda does.

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:35.160
-He’s, like, the nicest guy ever.
-He’s, like, Mormon nice.

00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:39.540
But that night, me and Avery,
we had something, and it was real.

00:16:39.623 --> 00:16:42.960
We bonded. We were laughing.
And she said I was cute.

00:16:43.043 --> 00:16:45.212
Okay, “cute”? You’re clinging to “cute.”

00:16:45.295 --> 00:16:48.716
Noah, my little brother’s cute.
That doesn’t mean I wanna have sex--

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:50.843
I’m not--

00:16:51.844 --> 00:16:52.928
You get it.

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.723
I get that you have sexual thoughts
about your little brother,

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.142
and I also get that you’re mean.

00:16:58.225 --> 00:17:00.936
You can tell that I’m in
an emotional state right now.

00:17:02.312 --> 00:17:07.443
Noah, relationships are all about energy
and attraction and intangible things,

00:17:07.526 --> 00:17:09.403
things beyond your control.

00:17:09.486 --> 00:17:11.363
Okay, you may be a great guy,

00:17:11.447 --> 00:17:14.033
but you were never gonna
be that guy to Avery.

00:17:14.116 --> 00:17:16.785
I just think it’s, you know,
time to move on.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.663
I’ve been telling him for three years.
You have something on your lips.

00:17:19.747 --> 00:17:22.041
-Let me get it with mine.
-Does that ever work for you?

00:17:22.124 --> 00:17:24.209
-Yes.
-It does, yes.

00:17:24.835 --> 00:17:27.296
And with that, Max can take it from here.

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.758
Feel better, Noah.

00:17:30.841 --> 00:17:34.178
It was lovely meeting you, by the way.
We’ll talk soon, at dinner or something.

00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:36.096
-Doubtful.
-She’s right.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.891
Why would Avery ever want to be with me?
Look at me.

00:17:40.809 --> 00:17:42.728
Look at me, Maxie. I got a Play-Doh face.

00:17:42.811 --> 00:17:44.938
People love your Play-Doh face.

00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:46.899
I got a disgusting face.

00:17:46.982 --> 00:17:48.609
Noah, I hate seeing you like this.

00:17:48.692 --> 00:17:50.486
[Noah stammering]

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:52.821
Let’s get you out of here. On your feet.

00:17:52.905 --> 00:17:54.531
Whoo!

00:17:54.615 --> 00:17:55.949
Oh! Oh! [grunts]

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:58.160
Help me help you.

00:17:58.243 --> 00:18:01.622
Ooh, here’s a tip.
Here’s a tip from my tip jar.

00:18:01.705 --> 00:18:04.792
Don’t fall in love!
She’s gonna rip your heart out!

00:18:04.875 --> 00:18:06.502
So sorry about my friend.

00:18:06.585 --> 00:18:08.378
-[grunting]
-You okay? You all right?

00:18:08.462 --> 00:18:09.880
-Focus. Focus.
-Where are we going?

00:18:09.963 --> 00:18:12.049
I’m gonna go score us a ride.
Just sit tight.

00:18:12.132 --> 00:18:13.634

00:28:10.772 --> 00:28:12.732
Hipster Waldo over there.

00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:17.195
Oh, my gosh, I think I know him.
His name is Patric.

00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:19.697
With no “K.” Yes.

00:28:19.781 --> 00:28:22.117
-Yes. You know him too?
-You know--

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.660
Oh, my God. They’re gonna fall in.

00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:27.705
-[laughs]
-Oh, you were so spot on.

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:29.541
Now they’re making out in the pool.

00:28:29.624 --> 00:28:31.209
-So tacky.
-I know, right?

00:28:31.292 --> 00:28:34.587
I ran into him once at this benefit.

00:28:34.671 --> 00:28:37.090
Oh, which one? I put on benefits.

00:28:37.173 --> 00:28:38.842
Which bene--? Um...

00:28:39.718 --> 00:28:42.303
It was a--
Well, which one was it? I go to so many.

00:28:42.387 --> 00:28:45.557
It was Kids Without... Toes.

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:46.850
Which is a big one.

00:28:46.933 --> 00:28:50.770
They say it’s the harelip
of our generation.

00:28:50.854 --> 00:28:52.480
That’s so sad.

00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:55.275
These kids, they can’t walk very--

00:28:55.358 --> 00:28:57.861
’Cause they don’t have toes, so th-they--

00:28:57.944 --> 00:29:00.989
It’s like they have hooves and--
That’s not important.

00:29:01.072 --> 00:29:04.659
What is important was,
this guy cornered me about sea turtles.

00:29:04.743 --> 00:29:06.161
Sea turtles! Yes!

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:09.122
I was like, “Dude, I get it.

00:29:09.205 --> 00:29:10.957
They are our most elegant
oceanic guardians.”

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.585
But it’s not about turtles.

00:29:13.668 --> 00:29:15.628
It’s about the toes.

00:29:15.712 --> 00:29:19.507
Or the lack thereof, in this case.
It’s so sad. It’s so sad.

00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:23.428
How do you think tonight’s going?
It’s going pretty good, right?

00:29:23.511 --> 00:29:25.680
I feel a good connection here.
Do you like music?

00:29:25.764 --> 00:29:28.683
I mean, of course you do. You like
breathing, right? Let’s get out of here.

00:29:28.767 --> 00:29:31.186
[piano jazz playing]

00:29:37.233 --> 00:29:40.278
You know, I’m thinking
you look like a Count Basie fan.

00:29:40.361 --> 00:29:42.697
Yeah, he’s my favorite.
How did you know that?

00:29:42.781 --> 00:29:45.283
I was just getting
Count Basie vibes from you.

00:29:45.366 --> 00:29:47.285
Uh-oh. What’s this hand about to do?

00:29:47.368 --> 00:29:49.370
-[piano intro]
-You know this one?

00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:50.830
I love this song.

00:29:52.832 --> 00:29:55.960
You know his name
actually is William Basie?

00:29:56.044 --> 00:29:57.712
Born in Red Bank, New Jersey.

00:29:57.796 --> 00:30:02.467
Eventually won nine Grammys for hits such
as “Little Darlin’” and “Corner Pocket.”

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:05.553
Of course, he did die
of pancreatic cancer in 1984.

00:30:05.637 --> 00:30:08.598
Those are just a few small facts,
in case you wanted to know.

00:30:08.681 --> 00:30:11.392
-You know a lot about Count Basie.
-Hey, I know my music history.

00:30:11.476 --> 00:30:13.978
[wheezing laugh]

00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:15.647
[Avery] This is great!

00:30:16.648 --> 00:30:19.192
-[Avery] These things are so much fun.
-Okay.

00:30:19.275 --> 00:30:21.194
-[Avery] This is gonna be great.
-Ready for this?

00:30:21.277 --> 00:30:23.029
-Yes.
-Pose hard.

00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:26.866
Wow, you’re really good at this.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:30.203
-Have you done this before?
-I’m actually 100 percent self-taught.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.914
-Wow.
-Yeah. I’ve never even had a lesson.

00:30:32.997 --> 00:30:34.707
-Really?
-I’m a natural.

00:30:34.791 --> 00:30:37.085
-That’s amazing.
-Come on. This is the best part.

00:30:37.168 --> 00:30:38.002
Okay.

00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:39.546
[Avery] That one is great.

00:30:39.629 --> 00:30:43.508
A lot of first-time photo booth couples
give off an obvious “cute” vibe.

00:30:43.591 --> 00:30:45.051
-Mm-hmm. Nope.
-Not us.

00:30:45.134 --> 00:30:47.762
-Not us. We gave off a real, authentic--
-[phone chimes]

00:30:47.846 --> 00:30:50.223
-Sort of natural thing we have between us.
-Oh, sorry.

00:30:51.474 --> 00:30:52.934
Drunken text from my roommate Carrie.

00:30:53.017 --> 00:30:56.521
She says, “Ugh. Made out with Dr. Douche
and puked from too many Jell-O shots.

00:30:56.604 --> 00:31:00.692
Home in two minutes
to come cry in your lap.” Bad night.

00:31:00.775 --> 00:31:02.652
-She’s coming here right now?
-Mm-hmm.

00:31:02.735 --> 00:31:06.322
Okay, uh, I should-- I should actually--
I’m gonna get going, ’cause I’m--

00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:08.366
Really? She’s gonna be here
in two seconds.

00:31:08.449 --> 00:31:11.160
Okay, uh, do you have
a back door or anything?

00:31:11.244 --> 00:31:13.788
I almost forgot.
How do you think tonight went?

00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:15.874
If tomorrow you were to meet a tall,

00:31:15.957 --> 00:31:18.710
conventionally good-looking,
successful guy,

00:31:18.793 --> 00:31:23.006
would this awesome connection we have
still be what you’re most excited about?

00:31:23.965 --> 00:31:26.009
-Sorry. What?
-It doesn’t matter.

00:31:31.472 --> 00:31:34.350
[sighs] Avery, you should
put a sock on the door.

00:31:36.102 --> 00:31:38.396
-I know you.
-[Noah] Mm-mmm.

00:31:38.479 --> 00:31:40.899
-I know you.
-I don’t know you. You’re a stranger.

00:31:40.982 --> 00:31:43.735
No, you’re the freak
at my wedding shoot today.

00:31:43.818 --> 00:31:45.528
-Mm-mmm.
-You two know each other?

00:31:45.612 --> 00:31:50.199
It’s getting late,
and I feel that alcohol is an issue here.

00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:51.284
This one seems--

00:31:51.367 --> 00:31:53.494
This is the psycho
I was telling you about!

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:55.496
The one who knew me,
said he was at our house,

00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.582
claimed to be some sort of
time-traveling nomad

00:31:57.665 --> 00:31:59.459
and spent last night
in the back of my Bronco.

00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:01.294
-Seems like she’s a little...
-[gasps]

00:32:01.377 --> 00:32:04.005
You didn’t guess I was an army brat.
You already knew that.

00:32:04.088 --> 00:32:06.382
-Because you’re a stalker!
-A stalker?

00:32:06.466 --> 00:32:07.842
-I knew it!
-I’m not a stalker.

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.469
I’m wearing a tuxedo.

00:32:09.552 --> 00:32:12.388
Stalkers wear, like, trench coats
and no underwear.

00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:15.141
And I am clearly wearing underwear. Look.

00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:17.560
-Oh, my God! Get out!
-Rape! Rape!

00:32:17.644 --> 00:32:20.396
Rape? Why would you say rape? It’s not r--

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.690
-Carrie!
-What we have tonight--

00:32:22.774 --> 00:32:23.775
that was cosmic, right?

00:32:23.858 --> 00:32:26.152
Don’t touch her, asshole!

00:32:26.235 --> 00:32:27.862
-“Don’t touch her asshole”?
-[grunts]

00:32:27.946 --> 00:32:31.908
[screams] Yes, Carrie! Hit him! Hit him!

00:32:31.991 --> 00:32:33.701
-[Noah groaning]
-Hit him harder!

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:36.329
Hit him in the balls! Hit him in the dick!

00:32:39.123 --> 00:32:41.000
[sighs]

00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:44.170
Oh, my God.

00:32:46.381 --> 00:32:47.590
Oh.

00:32:59.143 --> 00:33:01.145
[phone chimes]

00:33:13.116 --> 00:33:14.409
Whoo.

00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:18.287
Oh, looks like today’s apology day.

00:33:24.794 --> 00:33:26.045
[Ethan] One sec!

00:33:28.006 --> 00:33:30.133
-Hi. Can I help you?
-Hey, man, I just--

00:33:30.216 --> 00:33:32.760
I wanted to come by
and apologize for me at the party.

00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.929
Oh, you’re here for the party. Uh, cool.

00:33:35.013 --> 00:33:37.348
Yeah. Come on in.
We’re still setting up, but, uh--

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:39.517
-You’re having another party?
-Grab a drink.

00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:42.520
You must be one of Avery’s friends.
Avery, your first guest is here.

00:33:43.521 --> 00:33:47.275
So, you guys go to high school
together, or-- Wait. Northwestern?

00:33:47.358 --> 00:33:49.193
-I’m coming.
-What?

00:33:50.778 --> 00:33:51.946
Oh, my God.

00:33:52.030 --> 00:33:53.906
Hi.

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.783
-Oh, my God.
-What?

00:33:55.867 --> 00:33:57.952
-[gasps]
-You know what? I’m gonna go.

00:33:58.036 --> 00:33:59.996
-[screaming]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:34:02.123 --> 00:34:03.708
[groaning] It burns!

00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:06.669
-It’s him!
-[shouting incoherently]

00:34:06.753 --> 00:34:09.130
-It’s who? Who?
-Carrie!

00:34:09.213 --> 00:34:11.382
-It’s who?
-Oh, my God, he’s back!

00:34:11.466 --> 00:34:13.301
No, it’s a misunderstanding!

00:34:14.177 --> 00:34:16.137
[screams]

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:18.347
Why do you keep hitting me with trees?

00:34:18.431 --> 00:34:21.726
That’s the guy from three years ago!
That’s the stalker from Halloween!

00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:23.186
That’s the stalker?

00:34:27.982 --> 00:34:31.402
You don’t understand.
We’re old friends, Ethan!

00:34:31.486 --> 00:34:33.196
How do you know my name?

00:34:33.279 --> 00:34:35.782
How do you know my name, stalker?

00:34:35.865 --> 00:34:38.159
You’re right. I am a stalker.

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:41.120
A-And I’m crazy, and I’ve got a bomb.

00:34:41.204 --> 00:34:44.832
-He’s got a bomb.
-You’re right! I’ve got a bomb!

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:46.292
I’ve got a bomb!

00:34:46.375 --> 00:34:49.670
I-It’s fine. I’m sorry my bomb threat
ruined your magical evening.

00:34:49.754 --> 00:34:51.547
Have a great life.

00:34:53.674 --> 00:34:56.677
Yeah? You’d better come back
with more than a bomb next time, pal!

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:59.097
Ethan! <i>Less</i> than a bomb.

00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.641
-Less than a bomb!
-[exhales]

00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:11.192
Okay.

00:35:11.275 --> 00:35:13.319
So, you woke up here.

00:35:13.402 --> 00:35:15.154
How did you get here?

00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:18.574
Look for clues.

00:35:23.746 --> 00:35:25.123
Okay.

00:35:27.208 --> 00:35:29.335
Peppermint patty. ChapStick.

00:35:32.463 --> 00:35:33.881
A receipt?

00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:36.843
For the peppermint patty
and the ChapStick.

00:35:36.926 --> 00:35:38.469
[pops lips]

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:46.477
Oh, my God.

00:35:47.562 --> 00:35:48.855
The photo booth.

00:35:48.938 --> 00:35:50.982
[piano jazz playing]

00:35:51.065 --> 00:35:52.525
-Oh, shit. Sorry.
-Dude!

00:35:53.693 --> 00:35:56.279
-What kind of car do you drive?
-An Impreza. Why?

00:35:56.362 --> 00:35:59.991
Yeah, that’s the one. It’s getting towed
right now, so you have time. Save it.

00:36:00.074 --> 00:36:01.826
That’s my mom’s car.

00:36:01.909 --> 00:36:03.661
Well, your mom has a sick whip.

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:06.664
All right, come on.

00:36:06.747 --> 00:36:11.711
Come on. Take me.
Take me, take me, take me.

00:36:12.461 --> 00:36:14.297
[flash popping]

00:36:15.173 --> 00:36:16.966
Take me, take me--

00:36:21.762 --> 00:36:24.098
Holy shit.

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:27.351
Oh, I owned your ass,
space-time continuum.

00:36:27.435 --> 00:36:30.229
-I traveled through time.
-[beeping]

00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:32.565
-Max?
-[Max] <i>Yo. What up?</i>

00:36:32.648 --> 00:36:34.066
Hey, what’s up, man?

00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:36.611
Uh, I know you got
a big date tonight, but...

00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:38.863
I need your help.

00:36:41.199 --> 00:36:44.285
Nope, that is not what I wanted to do.

00:36:44.368 --> 00:36:45.203
<i>Hello?</i>

00:36:45.286 --> 00:36:48.664
Yeah. Hey, sorry. I don’t know why
I hung up, but I do need your help.

00:36:48.748 --> 00:36:51.000
Uh, there’s this girl.
Her name’s Avery, and...

00:36:52.543 --> 00:36:55.463
[sighs] We are already so late.

00:36:56.422 --> 00:36:59.133
What if she meets another guy
before I have a chance to get there?

00:36:59.217 --> 00:37:01.385
What are you talking about, bro?
It’s gonna be fine.

00:37:01.469 --> 00:37:05.223
And listen, I’m the one who had to cancel
on Carla, JC Penney underwear model.

00:37:05.306 --> 00:37:07.141
Intimates, bro. She’s got an old soul.

00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:10.561
Okay, dude, I’m serious.
You get more girls than any guy I know.

00:37:10.645 --> 00:37:12.813
-I need your help.
-You look good. Great start.

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.983
Well, thank you.
I appreciate you loaning me your shirt.

00:37:16.067 --> 00:37:18.694
But I don’t know, man. I have...

00:37:19.695 --> 00:37:21.822
I have leather strips in my armpits.

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.407
-This isn’t me.
-Exactly.

00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:25.576
’Cause Noah doesn’t get
that caliber of a girl.

00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.205
You gotta dress the part.
You gotta be ahead of the curve, bro.

00:37:29.288 --> 00:37:31.249
You gotta feel it. Look at me.

00:37:33.251 --> 00:37:35.002
[laughs]

00:37:35.086 --> 00:37:37.797
“Man, what’s up, girl?” Try that.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.842
So something’s funny off in the distance,
I squint, lick my lips and look at her?

00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:44.178
And you bring the attention back to her.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:46.472
This is stupid.

00:37:46.555 --> 00:37:49.517
-It’s great.
-[laughs]

00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:53.437
[laughing continues]

00:37:53.521 --> 00:37:56.065
-Are you doing a Joker impersonation?
-No, this is like--

00:37:56.148 --> 00:37:57.817
-It was good.
-That was-- Okay.

00:37:57.900 --> 00:37:59.318
Did you think that was bad?

00:37:59.402 --> 00:38:01.320
I’ll do it one more time.
Follow what I do.

00:38:01.404 --> 00:38:03.656
[laughs]

00:38:03.739 --> 00:38:05.533
What’s up, girl?

00:38:06.450 --> 00:38:08.119
[laughs]

00:38:08.202 --> 00:38:09.954
[moans]

00:38:10.037 --> 00:38:12.456
-What’s up, girl?
-Um, w-we’ll work on that.

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:15.626
You need a triple-A plan:
assertive, ambitious, asshole.

00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:18.713
There’s something about confidence
that a girl just loves.

00:38:18.796 --> 00:38:19.755
They smell it.

00:38:19.839 --> 00:38:21.841
Girls are attracted to guys
who know what they want

00:38:21.924 --> 00:38:24.135
and aren’t afraid to go for it,
which usually isn’t you.

00:38:24.218 --> 00:38:27.596
And I don’t like this part,
but if all else fails, be an asshole.

00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:30.766
-Be an asshole?
-Yeah. Not hard asshole. Soft asshole.

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:34.937
-I gotta be a soft asshole.
-Let me hear a soft asshole kind of dis.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:37.940
Your-- Your goatee’s--

00:38:38.024 --> 00:38:40.109
It-- It’s stupid. I’ve never liked it.

00:38:41.277 --> 00:38:42.361
Okay, wait. [clears throat]

00:38:42.445 --> 00:38:45.406
You have beady little satanic eyes.

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:49.118
Wow. That makes me doubt myself,
but in a sexy kind of way.

00:38:49.201 --> 00:38:52.913
’Cause girls can’t resist a guy
that makes ’em feel bad at first.

00:38:53.831 --> 00:38:55.958
-What are the three A’s?
-[sighs]

00:38:56.042 --> 00:38:58.586
Assertive, ambitious, asshole.

00:38:59.420 --> 00:39:00.546
Soft asshole.

00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:03.174
-Keep the shoulders down. Let’s do this.
-Triple-A. Always there.

00:39:10.556 --> 00:39:11.766
Don’t talk to him.

00:39:11.849 --> 00:39:13.809
-[song continues]
-[exhales]

00:39:13.893 --> 00:39:16.062
[Noah] No, she’s not in here.

00:39:16.145 --> 00:39:19.482
-I’m gonna go check outside again.
-No, no, no. You’re gonna stay here.

00:39:19.565 --> 00:39:23.611
Be cool. Don’t make it seem like you’re
chasing after her. Don’t be a stalker.

00:39:24.278 --> 00:39:26.197
[Noah] Oh, shit. There she is.

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.950
I was supposed to stop that drunk
Hulk asshole from bumping into her.

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.994
I blew it. Great.

00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:34.914
It’s not over. Okay? Maxie steps in now.

00:39:34.997 --> 00:39:36.582
I’m gonna distract her friend,

00:39:36.665 --> 00:39:39.085
the basketball player
that doesn’t know how to swim.

00:39:39.168 --> 00:39:41.170
No, she’s a Dunkin’ Donut.

00:39:41.253 --> 00:39:43.422
Oh! That’s good!

00:39:43.506 --> 00:39:44.882
Yeah, it’s pretty good.

00:39:44.965 --> 00:39:46.634
Anyways, look, engage your girl.

00:39:46.717 --> 00:39:49.011
Bring up her ex. Girls hate that.

00:39:49.095 --> 00:39:50.554
Stay close.

00:39:52.014 --> 00:39:55.184
Ooh! Can I talk to you privately
about something in private?

00:39:55.267 --> 00:39:58.354
-Uh, about what?
-We’re gonna get her a club soda first.

00:39:58.437 --> 00:40:01.357
And then I’ll talk to you
about the private stuff.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.441
That’s clever.

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:10.991
Mmm!

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.743
I like that jersey.

00:40:12.827 --> 00:40:15.037
And I am not afraid to tell you that.

00:40:15.121 --> 00:40:18.791
Yeah, I liked it a lot too
until the Hulk smashed it.

00:40:21.127 --> 00:40:23.504
-I think it looks really good.
-Thanks.

00:40:28.175 --> 00:40:30.845
What, are you, like,
dressed as a tranny or something?

00:40:33.556 --> 00:40:36.392
No! No. I-It’s from a movie.

00:40:36.475 --> 00:40:38.436
That’s cute.

00:40:38.519 --> 00:40:41.564
Yeah, I don’t really dig costumes.
That’s why I kinda--

00:40:41.647 --> 00:40:45.276
You came as nothing,
which is really endearing.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:48.654
-Okay, bye.
-No! Wait, uh--

00:40:48.737 --> 00:40:50.739
I’m gonna get you a drink. Okay?

00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:56.328
-Two beers, please.
-Hey, this one? Total marathon.

00:40:56.412 --> 00:40:59.123
But the stripper out front?
Sprint. My speed. Know what I’m sayin’?

00:40:59.206 --> 00:41:01.542
Yep. Okay, thank you very much,
Bill Cosby.

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:05.337
But before you go, make her earn it.
Don’t just give it to her.

00:41:08.466 --> 00:41:10.551
Yo, what’s up? Me again.

00:41:10.634 --> 00:41:12.428
So, this’ll be fun.

00:41:12.511 --> 00:41:15.639
You tell me something about yourself,
and if I find it interesting...

00:41:17.099 --> 00:41:19.810
Ding! I’m-a give you a beer.

00:41:19.894 --> 00:41:22.938
-What?
-Are you deaf? You couldn’t hear that?

00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:25.608
You know, I think I figured out
who you are.

00:41:25.691 --> 00:41:27.318
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

00:41:27.401 --> 00:41:30.279
You are a giant,
human being-sized asshole.

00:41:30.362 --> 00:41:32.364
Thank you for the beer.
Have a great night.

00:41:37.495 --> 00:41:38.662
Wait. Okay, wait.

00:41:38.746 --> 00:41:40.289
-Be back, girl.
-Mm-hmm.

00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:45.586
-Hey, where you going?
-Anywhere that you aren’t gonna be.

00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:51.175
Ew. I hate it when girls are this into me.

00:41:51.258 --> 00:41:54.470
And please, do me a favor.
Don’t talk to me like your ex-boyfriend.

00:41:54.553 --> 00:41:55.763
I’m not.

00:41:55.846 --> 00:41:59.391
If he talked to me the way you’re talking
to me, I would punch him in the face.

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:01.185
-You would?
-But you’re a total stranger.

00:42:01.268 --> 00:42:03.646
So I could probably kill you
and get away with it.

00:42:03.729 --> 00:42:06.023
-Go ahead. Shank me.
-God, I wish I could.

00:42:06.106 --> 00:42:07.191
-Do it.
-Okay, I will.

00:42:07.274 --> 00:42:08.734
-I don’t believe you.
-Okay.

00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:10.152
Whoa!

00:42:13.822 --> 00:42:16.450
[groans] Great. Yep.

00:42:16.534 --> 00:42:18.827
Yes, I’m fine. Thank you. How’d it feel?

00:42:18.911 --> 00:42:21.413
That felt really great, actually.

00:42:21.497 --> 00:42:23.415
-Can you at least help me out?
-Fine.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.168
Here. Take my hand. I’ll help you--

[Avery] What the hell!

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:35.386
Whoo. Whoo!

00:42:35.469 --> 00:42:38.430
-You dick!
-I’m the dick? How am I the dick?

00:42:38.514 --> 00:42:41.350
-You’re the one who pushed me in.
-You told me to push you in!

00:42:41.433 --> 00:42:44.687
I told you to shank me in the ribs
for emotional closure.

00:42:44.770 --> 00:42:46.814
-You’re the worst.
-<i>You’re</i> the worst!

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:50.067
-<i>You’re</i> the worst.
-No, you’re the worst.

00:42:53.362 --> 00:42:55.614
[guests exclaiming, cheering]

00:42:58.450 --> 00:43:01.161
Now we’re the people at the party
that make out in the pool.

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:03.247
I don’t care.

00:43:04.707 --> 00:43:07.293
-[moaning] You’re the worst.
-Okay, here we go.

00:43:07.376 --> 00:43:08.836
Okay. Yeah.

00:43:13.007 --> 00:43:15.843
You know what?
I’m gonna put a sock on the door.

00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.428
No, wait. Here, just...

00:43:19.597 --> 00:43:20.598
[glass shatters]

00:43:21.765 --> 00:43:24.643
Here. Okay. Bedroom’s this way. Let’s go.

00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:29.690
Oh, not today, tree.

00:43:53.631 --> 00:43:55.424
Oh-ho!

00:43:55.507 --> 00:43:57.176
Oh, my God.

00:43:58.594 --> 00:44:00.179
Twice. Okay.

00:44:01.472 --> 00:44:02.765
Very good.

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:09.396
-Mmm.
-What are you doing?

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:12.650
Being the big spoon.

00:44:16.570 --> 00:44:18.364
Since when do we spoon?

00:44:19.948 --> 00:44:23.869
Since we started dating
and fell madly in love.

00:44:23.952 --> 00:44:25.954
[kissing]

00:44:28.123 --> 00:44:31.377
What are you still doing here?
You hate sleeping over.

00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.253
Okay, what’s going on here?

00:44:33.921 --> 00:44:36.674
God, please.
You were not that drunk last night.

00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:40.469
Remember? I texted you at midnight.

00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.764
Had a shit day at work
and my mother was harassing me

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.974
about when I’m gonna finally find
a decent dude.

00:44:46.058 --> 00:44:49.061
Which isn’t gonna happen
if you and I keep doing this shit.

00:44:50.062 --> 00:44:51.522
[sighs]

00:44:51.605 --> 00:44:55.150
If you weren’t so good at sex,
this would have ended a long time ago.

00:44:57.111 --> 00:44:58.654
Wait, what’s that?

00:44:58.737 --> 00:45:00.697
We’re good at sex with each--?

00:45:00.781 --> 00:45:03.283
Oh. Yeah. Okay, that’s cool.

00:45:03.367 --> 00:45:07.621
Okay, on the count of three, what is,
like, our favorite position, sexually?

00:45:07.704 --> 00:45:11.125
One, two, three.

00:45:11.208 --> 00:45:13.460
[whispers] Is it doggie style?

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:15.087
Is that our favorite?

00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:18.799
Can you just get dressed? ’Cause I’m
busy today. You really can’t stay here.

00:45:18.882 --> 00:45:21.301
Yes, I will get dressed.

00:45:21.385 --> 00:45:25.139
But did you want to have
morning sex real quick?

00:45:25.222 --> 00:45:27.349
-Just to get the day started?
-Here.

00:45:27.433 --> 00:45:29.476
Don’t forget your, uh, leather pants.

00:45:30.853 --> 00:45:33.230
[door opens, closes]

00:45:37.317 --> 00:45:40.195
Oh, my God.

00:45:40.279 --> 00:45:42.197
I went full asshole.

00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:49.037
[exhales]

00:45:49.121 --> 00:45:50.330
[door opens]

00:45:51.123 --> 00:45:52.749
Oh, great, it’s you.

00:45:52.833 --> 00:45:54.543
Oh, great, you.

00:45:54.626 --> 00:45:56.462
What the hell is...? Hey, what’s up?

00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:58.088
Why are you...? Why’s he here?

00:45:58.172 --> 00:46:00.090
Hey, man. Uh, Noah, right? Yeah.

00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:01.175
That’s right.

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:04.011
-Haven’t seen you around. How’s it going?
-Mm-hmm. It’s going--

00:46:04.094 --> 00:46:06.180
How does he...? How do you know Avery?

00:46:06.263 --> 00:46:09.099
Uh, we’re her friends,
which is more than you can say.

00:46:09.183 --> 00:46:11.894
Why don’t you take your frosted tips,
get on your “douche bag-mobile.”

00:46:11.977 --> 00:46:12.895
We’d all appreciate it.

00:46:14.021 --> 00:46:15.689
[Noah] Oh, my God.

00:46:16.315 --> 00:46:19.526
-That’s what I drive now?
-Oh, I see what he’s doing.

00:46:20.194 --> 00:46:21.028
Awesome.

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:23.697
Sorry to keep you waiting. I’m ready.
Oh, thank you.

00:46:23.781 --> 00:46:27.910
What are we doing? We CrossFitting?
Pilates? Hot yoga? I’m down.

00:46:27.993 --> 00:46:31.663
Just a little park run today, actually.
That is, if Carrie can keep up.

00:46:31.747 --> 00:46:32.873
[laughing]

00:46:32.956 --> 00:46:34.666
[laughing]

00:46:34.750 --> 00:46:38.337
Yeah, if Carrie can-- That’s-- You are--
Ethan’s funny.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:41.965
You know, I was just actually saying
to a personal friend of mine

00:46:42.049 --> 00:46:44.301
that I don’t run in a park setting enough.

00:46:44.384 --> 00:46:45.511
So I’ll join you guys.

00:46:46.303 --> 00:46:47.387
Oh, okay.

00:46:47.471 --> 00:46:48.972
-Come on.
-All right. Whoo!

00:46:49.056 --> 00:46:51.808
Let’s go. Let’s go. A-let’s go.

00:46:51.892 --> 00:46:53.519
Come on. All right.

00:46:55.062 --> 00:46:57.397
Uh-- [chuckles] Good one, Noah.

00:47:13.413 --> 00:47:16.458
Oh, God. Oh.
These pants are not breathable.

00:47:16.542 --> 00:47:18.836
-[Carrie laughs]
-[Avery] Ethan, you’re barely sweating.

00:47:18.919 --> 00:47:20.128
[sighs]

00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:24.800
Yo. Yo. Hey, Ethan.

00:47:24.883 --> 00:47:28.011
I’m thinking we should get
to know each other a little better, right?

00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:29.846
You’re probably married with kids now?

00:47:29.930 --> 00:47:32.391
Uh, single.
Actually, just got out of a relationship.

00:47:32.849 --> 00:47:34.726
You and Stacy broke up. I’m so sorry.

00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.521
Man, she-- she seemed like the one.
That’s too bad.

00:47:38.105 --> 00:47:39.231
[chuckles]

00:47:39.314 --> 00:47:40.899
-[panting]
-Are you okay?

00:47:40.983 --> 00:47:43.193
We can slow down
or take a break if you need to.

00:47:43.277 --> 00:47:45.028
I don’t need a break.
You might need a break.

00:47:45.112 --> 00:47:48.407
In fact, I was thinking let’s--
let’s get physical! Yeah!

00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:50.617
Okay. Diggin’ the energy. Let’s go.

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:53.620
All right. Now we’re talking.
Let’s, uh, hurdle this thing.

00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:56.582
Whoo. Yeah. [grunts]

00:47:56.665 --> 00:47:58.834
Good idea, Noah. Try some harder ones.

00:47:58.917 --> 00:48:01.003
We’re going harder.
We’re gonna do a harder one.

00:48:01.086 --> 00:48:02.963
Yeah, okay. All right!

00:48:03.046 --> 00:48:04.548
Watch the ankles.

00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:05.591
[Avery] Okay.

00:48:06.091 --> 00:48:07.426
[Carrie] Here we go. Whoo!

00:48:07.509 --> 00:48:08.802
[Avery] Yeah.

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:11.054
[grunting] Aaah. Aaah!

00:48:11.138 --> 00:48:13.640
-Quickly! Quickly! Quickly!
-[Carrie] Right behind you.

00:48:13.724 --> 00:48:14.725
-[Avery laughs]
-[panting]

00:48:14.808 --> 00:48:17.352
[Carrie] Ethan, you have so much energy.

00:48:17.436 --> 00:48:18.770
[groans]

00:48:18.854 --> 00:48:21.148
-Stepping it up on this one.
-All right.

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:23.984
-Whoo!
-Yep.

00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:27.529
Oh! [grunts]

00:48:28.113 --> 00:48:29.698
Oh! [groans]

00:48:29.781 --> 00:48:31.450
Yeah. Oh, that hurt.

00:48:31.533 --> 00:48:32.868
Oh, yeah.

00:48:32.951 --> 00:48:35.120
Oh, I think I’m gonna need
some face stitches.

00:48:35.621 --> 00:48:37.664
Are you sure?
Just looks like a little scrape.

00:48:37.748 --> 00:48:40.626
I-I feel like it’s--
it’s worse than just a scrape.

00:48:40.709 --> 00:48:44.421
I think you and Carrie should just
go ahead without me, and Avery and I--

00:48:44.504 --> 00:48:45.714
Actually, it’s not that bad.

00:48:45.797 --> 00:48:49.176
If you guys wanna keep going,
I have a first aid kit in my truck.

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:51.470
-I’ll make sure he doesn’t bleed out.
-Okay.

00:48:51.553 --> 00:48:53.138
Thanks, Carrie. Feel better, all right?

00:48:53.221 --> 00:48:54.848
-Yeah, feel better.
-Ice it.

00:48:55.724 --> 00:48:57.434
-Okay.
-Thank you.

00:48:57.517 --> 00:48:59.353
-Come on.
-[grunts]

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:01.647
Look. Look what’s happening. Right now.

00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:05.150
She’s escaping with him, and she--
she hates me.

00:49:05.233 --> 00:49:06.818
She doesn’t “hate you” hate you.

00:49:06.902 --> 00:49:08.904
You’re one of those guys
girls sleep with sometimes,

00:49:08.987 --> 00:49:10.781
and as a result,
we wind up hating ourselves.

00:49:10.864 --> 00:49:12.991
Okay. What can I do to change that?

00:49:13.784 --> 00:49:15.827
You’re the guy
who strolls in for a quickie,

00:49:15.911 --> 00:49:17.329
then you disappear for two months.

00:49:17.412 --> 00:49:18.997
What?

00:49:19.081 --> 00:49:21.750
I have no control over any of this.

00:49:21.833 --> 00:49:25.462
I make a decision, and then I wake up
three years later with the consequences.

00:49:26.129 --> 00:49:27.297
Way to take responsibility, pal.

00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:30.634
Oh, hey, look.
Look, look, look, look, look.

00:49:30.717 --> 00:49:33.887
I’m just trying to be the type of guy
that Avery would want to be with.

00:49:36.598 --> 00:49:38.308
Noah, if you’re screwing with me,

00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:40.560
I will cut your nuts off
and wear them as earrings.

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:43.397
Carrie, I am being 100 percent real.

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:45.148
Candid.

00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:47.275
[chuckles] You look like shit.

00:49:51.905 --> 00:49:54.199
So you’re saying
you’re in love with Avery?

00:49:55.158 --> 00:49:56.702
No, dude, just no.

00:49:57.536 --> 00:49:59.413
What do you mean, “No, just no”?

00:50:00.122 --> 00:50:03.208
Okay, all due respect, I’m pretty sure
the closest you’ve been to love

00:50:03.291 --> 00:50:05.752
is taking photos of strangers at weddings.

00:50:05.836 --> 00:50:08.213
Oh, yeah? Well, you drink coffee
with whipped cream in it,

00:50:08.296 --> 00:50:10.215
so I can’t take
anything you say seriously.

00:50:12.467 --> 00:50:14.052
It’s comforting me.

00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:16.930
And I know emotions don’t penetrate you,

00:50:17.013 --> 00:50:19.057
so you wouldn’t understand how this feels.

00:50:19.141 --> 00:50:21.518
It’s not like I’ve never had
my heart broken before.

00:50:21.601 --> 00:50:23.228
Well, I have a hard time believing that,

00:50:23.311 --> 00:50:26.189
because every time we’ve talked,
you’ve been pretty impenetrable.

00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:27.607
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

00:50:27.691 --> 00:50:30.318
Because this is easily
the longest conversation we’ve ever had.

00:50:32.028 --> 00:50:33.655
Let’s just say I learned to--

00:50:33.739 --> 00:50:34.948
What, move on?

00:50:36.074 --> 00:50:37.534
Yeah. Something like that.

00:50:37.617 --> 00:50:41.705
I mean, there has to be a way that
I could prove I’m as good as Ethan is.

00:50:41.788 --> 00:50:43.373
Those two are just buds.

00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:44.875
Right. Yeah, buds.

00:50:44.958 --> 00:50:48.170
Because I’ve been love-blocking them
since the second we met.

00:50:48.253 --> 00:50:49.671
They’re like love magnets,

00:50:49.755 --> 00:50:52.507
and no matter what happens,
they’re gonna smash into each other

00:50:52.591 --> 00:50:54.801
over and over and over and over.

00:50:54.885 --> 00:50:57.304
Okay, I get it.
You’re extremely threatened by Ethan.

00:50:57.387 --> 00:50:58.680
He’s stable, he’s secure.

00:50:58.764 --> 00:51:01.308
As long as I’ve known Avery,
she’s been driven,

00:51:01.391 --> 00:51:04.561
but, yeah, she wants the home
with the white picket fence, family.

00:51:04.644 --> 00:51:07.105
She’s a sucker for all that.
It’s not really my thing.

00:51:07.189 --> 00:51:09.274
You’re absolutely right. Yes.

00:51:09.941 --> 00:51:11.985
I have to be that guy.

00:51:12.068 --> 00:51:14.905
It makes-- It makes perfect sense.

00:51:14.988 --> 00:51:16.948
She wants someone to build a future with,

00:51:17.032 --> 00:51:19.242
and that’s what Ethan can give her
that I can’t.

00:51:21.286 --> 00:51:22.287
Yet.

00:51:24.122 --> 00:51:25.624
I could totally be that guy.

00:51:25.707 --> 00:51:27.626
I went to business school,
for Christ’s sake.

00:51:27.709 --> 00:51:28.752
[claps]

00:51:31.046 --> 00:51:33.548
Okay, Avery. You want something different?

00:51:33.632 --> 00:51:36.760
I understand. Well, I’m about to be
the man of your dreams.

00:51:41.264 --> 00:51:43.225
Come on. Let’s go.

00:51:44.392 --> 00:51:45.602
I’m ready.

00:51:49.898 --> 00:51:51.733
[exhales]

00:51:53.777 --> 00:51:55.403
Okay.

00:51:56.696 --> 00:51:58.281
Yes.

00:51:58.365 --> 00:52:00.575
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:04.538
Perfect.

00:52:04.621 --> 00:52:05.622
Max?

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:07.874
I’m here for a job, my man.

00:52:10.627 --> 00:52:11.795
You gorgeous son of a bitch.

00:52:11.878 --> 00:52:13.296
-Get in here, bro.
-[laughing]

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:16.550
Yes. I’m so proud of you.
I’ve been waiting for this so long.

00:52:16.633 --> 00:52:18.718
Me and you are gonna run this place
together someday.

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:20.470
-I hope so.
-[Costigan] Max.

00:52:20.554 --> 00:52:22.514
Go get my lettuce cups already.

00:52:22.597 --> 00:52:24.724
All right. Right away, sir.

00:52:24.808 --> 00:52:26.643
Okay, no. You handle the mail.

00:52:26.726 --> 00:52:29.688
Turn in my résumé.
I’ll go get the lettuce cups, okay?

00:52:29.771 --> 00:52:30.981
All right. Thanks, buddy.

00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:34.484
Also, real quick. What are lettuce cups?

00:52:34.568 --> 00:52:36.403
Uh, it’s lettuce
but in the shape of a cup.

00:52:36.486 --> 00:52:37.696
Okay.

00:52:37.779 --> 00:52:39.406
No, no Hulk smashing.

00:52:39.489 --> 00:52:41.032
-Hulk smash.
-No more smashing.

00:52:41.116 --> 00:52:43.410
Hulk sitting. That’s what Hulkie's doing.

00:52:43.994 --> 00:52:47.163
Okay, let’s get this good stuff in ya.

00:52:47.831 --> 00:52:52.002
Let’s get you hydrated before you barrel
into a crowd full of innocent strangers.

00:52:52.085 --> 00:52:53.420
Okay? There you go.

00:52:53.503 --> 00:52:55.422
-Hulk drink.
-Yes, Hulk drink.

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:57.299
Good Hulk. Doing good, Hulk.

00:52:57.966 --> 00:53:01.595
There he is.
Best costume of the party award.

00:53:01.678 --> 00:53:04.097
Angus Young? AC/DC?

00:53:04.180 --> 00:53:07.142
You just made my night complete.

00:53:07.225 --> 00:53:09.769
[laughs] Thank you so much.

00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.772
For those about to rock,

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.733
we salute you.

00:53:15.775 --> 00:53:19.613
Thank you so much for this.
Best Halloween ever!

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.990
Yes, it is.
Oh, you’re still doing that walk.

00:53:22.866 --> 00:53:24.075
Very good. Right?

00:53:24.159 --> 00:53:26.912
So this is all anyone really wants, right?

00:53:26.995 --> 00:53:29.581
Someone to support and take care of them.

00:53:30.081 --> 00:53:33.376
Someone secure who’s also, like--
like a mythically nice person

00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:35.879
to be the rock in their time of need.

00:53:35.962 --> 00:53:36.796
Right?

00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:39.049
There she is.
There’s that girl I was telling you about.

00:53:44.346 --> 00:53:45.555
Dottie Hinson.

00:53:45.639 --> 00:53:48.266
They’re calling your name. You’re on deck.

00:53:48.350 --> 00:53:50.018
-Oh, am I?
-Mm-hmm.

00:53:50.101 --> 00:53:53.772
You are a patriotic toddler?

00:53:53.855 --> 00:53:55.482
I am the American dream.

00:53:55.565 --> 00:53:57.901
-[snoring]
-[laughing]

00:53:58.693 --> 00:53:59.819
Are you?

00:53:59.903 --> 00:54:01.488
-Okay. I like that.
-Hey.

00:54:02.238 --> 00:54:05.533
Do you wanna hang out
and then get a house in the suburbs,

00:54:05.617 --> 00:54:08.244
adopt a golden retriever,
have 2.8 kids together?

00:54:08.328 --> 00:54:11.039
[clicks tongue] I mean, I do like dogs.

00:54:11.122 --> 00:54:14.250
-Maybe we should get a drink first.
-That’s probably a good place to start.

00:54:14.334 --> 00:54:15.168
Yeah.

00:54:15.251 --> 00:54:17.087
[piano playing]

00:54:22.509 --> 00:54:23.760
Excuse me.

00:54:23.843 --> 00:54:25.887
-[Noah] Garçon.
-Hey, Noah.

00:54:26.388 --> 00:54:28.723
We’d like to order
your most expensive bottle of wine.

00:54:28.807 --> 00:54:31.351
-Ooh, you’re fancy.
-Mm-hmm.

00:54:31.434 --> 00:54:33.311
Noah, that’s a $500 bottle of wine, dude.

00:54:37.273 --> 00:54:41.861
[stammers] Then we would like your most
reasonably priced bottle of wine.

00:54:41.945 --> 00:54:43.822
-[laughs]
-So $95?

00:54:47.117 --> 00:54:49.160
Yeah. Uh-huh. Yes.

00:54:49.244 --> 00:54:51.371
-That’s perfect.
-Coming right up.

00:54:51.454 --> 00:54:53.456
[sighs] This is really nice.

00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.292
-You just think this is “nice”?
-Yeah.

00:54:56.376 --> 00:54:59.421
This is gonna be one of the best nights
of your life.

00:54:59.504 --> 00:55:01.172
I can deal with best night of my life.

00:55:01.256 --> 00:55:03.425
And it’s starting right now.

00:55:05.301 --> 00:55:06.803
[song ends]

00:55:06.886 --> 00:55:08.013
[woman] Whoo!

00:55:08.096 --> 00:55:09.097
[mouths] Thank you.

00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:10.432
All right. That was good.

00:55:11.933 --> 00:55:14.936
Right now we’re gonna dedicate
this next tune to my main man, Noah,

00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.897
and his beautiful,
lovely new lady friend, Avery.

00:55:19.524 --> 00:55:20.984
-How did he know your name?
-Noah.

00:55:21.067 --> 00:55:24.070
-What did you do?
-We’re gonna miss you around here, bro.

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:26.823
This entire evening is dedicated to you.

00:55:27.907 --> 00:55:30.076
[piano intro]

00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.328
-You like Count Basie?
-I do. I love him.

00:55:32.412 --> 00:55:35.623
Luckily,
that’s basically all that Danny knows.

00:55:35.707 --> 00:55:39.502
So what did he mean when he said
that they’re gonna miss you?

00:55:40.003 --> 00:55:42.505
-I used to work here.
-Oh, you did?

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:44.674
Yeah, that piano bench right there,

00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:48.511
it’s still warm to the touch
from my butt cheeks.

00:55:50.013 --> 00:55:52.682
I got a hot butt.
I don’t know if you know that or not.

00:55:52.766 --> 00:55:55.101
-No, not yet.
-You check it out?

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:58.313
Why would you quit though?
This place is amazing.

00:55:58.396 --> 00:56:01.649
I’m just taking
an extended leave of absence

00:56:01.733 --> 00:56:03.777
to live a more grown-up life.

00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:05.695
Oh. So, like, boring?

00:56:05.779 --> 00:56:08.239
I’m wearing
a red, white and blue onesie right now.

00:56:08.323 --> 00:56:11.659
Do I look like the kind of guy
that would aspire to live a boring life?

00:56:13.119 --> 00:56:14.954
No. [laughs]

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:16.247
Very not boring.

00:56:16.331 --> 00:56:19.334
[piano continues]

00:56:27.759 --> 00:56:29.761
[alarm beeping]

00:56:39.938 --> 00:56:41.439
What the hell?

00:56:43.358 --> 00:56:44.400
What?

00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:45.777
What, am I fat?

00:56:46.569 --> 00:56:49.155
I’m fat now. Great. I’m fat now.

00:56:49.864 --> 00:56:51.199
Great, I’m fat!

00:56:51.783 --> 00:56:53.576
This is all working out, isn’t it?

00:56:57.914 --> 00:56:58.998
[chuckles]

00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:02.627
Ohh...

00:57:04.212 --> 00:57:06.464
It’s comfort weight. [laughs]

00:57:12.512 --> 00:57:13.513
Oh!

00:57:13.596 --> 00:57:16.433
Noah, you’re a boss.

00:57:16.516 --> 00:57:18.184
You have arrived.

00:57:19.102 --> 00:57:20.395
Hi, Mr. Noah.

00:57:21.396 --> 00:57:23.648
Hey, babe, you’re up.

00:57:23.731 --> 00:57:25.483
I’m way up. I am so up.

00:57:25.567 --> 00:57:27.068
I missed you last night.

00:57:27.152 --> 00:57:30.155
Oh, that is so, so good to hear.

00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:32.157
Mmm.

00:57:34.534 --> 00:57:36.911
-You want some breakfast?
-I would love some.

00:57:36.995 --> 00:57:37.912
Okay.

00:57:38.913 --> 00:57:40.165
Oh.

00:57:40.248 --> 00:57:42.500
I love our house. It’s awesome.

00:57:42.584 --> 00:57:45.170
It’s large, you know, yet kind of cozy.

00:57:45.253 --> 00:57:48.631
And obviously I’m wealthy, but this is
tastefully decorated. It’s not gaudy.

00:57:48.715 --> 00:57:50.967
Are you okay? You’re acting weird.

00:57:51.551 --> 00:57:53.386
Oh, I’m okay. I’ve never felt better.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.472
[gasps] Oh, I almost forgot.

00:57:57.223 --> 00:57:59.893
Look what came
just in time for the party tonight.

00:58:00.560 --> 00:58:01.561
Okay.

00:58:03.730 --> 00:58:06.608
What do you think? Too cheesy?

00:58:06.691 --> 00:58:07.692
[snickers]

00:58:08.818 --> 00:58:11.154
That is the most beautiful plate
I’ve ever seen.

00:58:11.237 --> 00:58:14.240
I love it. You’re big-spooning me.
It’s perfect.

00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:16.701
And I love the message too. “Forever”?

00:58:16.784 --> 00:58:19.954
Oh, my God! Look at this ring!

00:58:20.038 --> 00:58:22.040
Oh, what?

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.625
I’m, like--

00:58:24.125 --> 00:58:25.710
I’m a rich dude.

00:58:25.793 --> 00:58:28.296
-I know.
-Oh, I am good to you, huh?

00:58:28.379 --> 00:58:29.631
-Come in here.
-Okay.

00:58:29.714 --> 00:58:31.341
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

00:58:31.424 --> 00:58:33.885
Oh, come on. Mom! Dad!

00:58:35.470 --> 00:58:37.889
Carrie. What are you doing here?

00:58:37.972 --> 00:58:41.100
Well, I’m not trying to win house guest
of the year or anything,

00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:43.394
but I did pick up your engagement photos
from the lab.

00:58:43.478 --> 00:58:45.688
-Ooh.
-She’s a-- You’re a house guest.

00:58:45.772 --> 00:58:48.942
She lives here with us.
You’re our house guest. Okay.

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.026
Oh, well...

00:58:51.194 --> 00:58:52.820
not for very long.

00:58:52.904 --> 00:58:53.738
Okay.

00:58:53.821 --> 00:58:56.950
I kind of have some really,
really exciting news.

00:58:57.033 --> 00:58:59.536
Not to one-up you,
but my gallery showing was last night,

00:58:59.619 --> 00:59:02.997
and I sold my entire collection of photos.

00:59:03.081 --> 00:59:04.541
-That is so exciting.
-Wow.

00:59:04.624 --> 00:59:06.292
-Congratulations.
-That is huge.

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:07.544
What will I do without you?

00:59:07.627 --> 00:59:10.672
This house gets so creepy
when Noah’s traveling and I’m home alone.

00:59:10.755 --> 00:59:12.966
[chuckles] What? No.

00:59:13.049 --> 00:59:14.801
No, it’s not creepy.

00:59:14.884 --> 00:59:16.928
And no one’s gonna feel alone.
Not in this house.

00:59:17.011 --> 00:59:19.681
You know what?
You could stay here as long as you want.

00:59:19.764 --> 00:59:21.599
If it makes Avery happy,
it makes me happy.

00:59:22.684 --> 00:59:25.687
Mmm! Goddamn, that coffee is good!

00:59:29.607 --> 00:59:31.109
[chortling]

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:34.904
Oh, my God.

00:59:34.988 --> 00:59:36.072
[car alarm chirps]

00:59:36.155 --> 00:59:38.908
This is my favorite car.
This is my, like, all-time fav--

00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:41.286
Of course I would have this car.
It makes perfect sense.

00:59:41.995 --> 00:59:43.246
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:47.500
[engine starts, revs]

00:59:47.584 --> 00:59:50.587
Uh-oh, that dog’s barkin’.
That dog is a-barkin’.

00:59:50.670 --> 00:59:52.839
-[barking]
-Right.

00:59:52.922 --> 00:59:55.258
So you’re gonna be home
on time today, right?

00:59:55.341 --> 00:59:57.927
For the party? Of course. Yes.
I’m excited.

00:59:58.011 --> 00:59:59.554
-This is a big deal for us.
-Yeah.

01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:02.223
-Let’s make some memories. Right?
-[phone chiming]

01:00:03.474 --> 01:00:05.310
Sorry about this. 7:30 in the morning.

01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:07.604
Yeah, here. Don’t forget this one.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:09.981
-You left it on your nightstand.
-I have two phones.

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.190
I know. [clicks tongue]

01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:12.984
-[chiming continues]
-No, decli-- All right.

01:00:13.067 --> 01:00:14.861
-Now this one. Okay.
<i>-Incoming call from--</i>

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:16.404
-No, thanks.
-[phone chimes]

01:00:16.487 --> 01:00:18.072
-Sorry. Uh--
-[car comm system beeping]

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.617
<i>-Incoming call from work.</i>
-No, I don’t wanna answer.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.786
-Where’s the button to--
<i>-Incoming call from work.</i>

01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:25.705
I don’t know how to-- No, thank you.

01:00:25.788 --> 01:00:28.249
<i>-Incoming call from--</i>
-Decline the call!

01:00:31.836 --> 01:00:33.838
[whistling]

01:00:33.921 --> 01:00:37.425
[phones ringing]

01:00:40.762 --> 01:00:42.930
Hello? Anyone here?

01:00:46.517 --> 01:00:48.102
Someone tell me where I sit?

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.812
[ringing continues]

01:00:51.606 --> 01:00:53.358
What the...? Okay.

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:56.778
-Hello?
-Surprise!

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:58.488
Congratulations, Noah.

01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:00.573
Ever since your first day as an assistant,

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.284
no one has worked harder
or wanted it more.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:04.952
Son, you’ve earned this.

01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:07.121
-Earned what exactly?
-This.

01:01:08.790 --> 01:01:12.085
Your new office,
Mr. Senior Vice President.

01:01:12.168 --> 01:01:13.670
This is my office, huh?

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:18.299
Mr. Chun came from Shanghai
specifically to be here for this.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:22.011
[in Mandarin] Congratulations, Mr. Ashby.
This is great news.

01:01:24.389 --> 01:01:27.350
With our biggest accounts,
your success is our success.

01:01:28.393 --> 01:01:29.769
It’s a ton of Chinese.

01:01:33.022 --> 01:01:34.857
[in Mandarin] Thank you so much.

01:01:36.275 --> 01:01:37.527
I speak Chinese?!

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.029
That’s so cool!

01:01:41.739 --> 01:01:43.449
I don’t even know what I’m saying.

01:01:44.325 --> 01:01:48.246
Well, according to most prognosticators,

01:01:48.329 --> 01:01:52.583
with our large-cap portfolios
outperforming this bear market...

01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:54.669
What is Mandarin for
“Get a room, you two”?

01:01:54.752 --> 01:01:56.254
[laughing]

01:01:56.921 --> 01:02:01.259
...it should elicit fortuitous returns.

01:02:01.342 --> 01:02:02.593
Absolutely right.

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:04.345
Whoo. [chuckles]

01:02:04.429 --> 01:02:07.557
Holy shit! I know some big ass words!

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.350
[laughing]

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:13.813
I don’t know what you said.
Yes. You seem happy.

01:02:13.896 --> 01:02:15.189
He’s so awesome!

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:16.983
So I’m happy. Is this kid great?

01:02:17.066 --> 01:02:19.819
Let me give you a tour of the place,
Mr. Chun. Show you under the hood?

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.320
-All-star.
-[in English] Thank you.

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:22.947
Thanks a lot, Terrence.

01:02:23.030 --> 01:02:26.409
Thanks a lot, Darryl. Bill.
I know your names. Big Jeff.

01:02:26.492 --> 01:02:29.746
Little Tony. Hey, Claudette. Rob. Carl.

01:02:30.455 --> 01:02:32.415
-Thank you, Courtney.
-So great.

01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:35.376
Sharon. She’s got a sick kid.
I feel bad for her.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:37.628
I don’t know how I know that.
I know everyone’s name.

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:41.007
Max! What’s up, my man? Whoo. We did it.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:43.509
Yeah, “we.” Did it. Yeah.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.136
-Yes, we did.
-[chuckles]

01:02:45.219 --> 01:02:48.347
Do you mind if I steal you from the parade
and talk to you real quick?

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:50.057
Uh, yeah, sure. Come on.

01:02:50.141 --> 01:02:51.768
Welcome to Noah’s lair.

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:54.103
Ooh, this is sweet, dude.

01:02:55.104 --> 01:02:56.105
Whoa.

01:02:58.983 --> 01:03:01.944
Look what we got here.
Mr. Senior Vice President.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.613
-May I?
-You may.

01:03:05.114 --> 01:03:07.325
-Ah.
-This is cool, right?

01:03:07.408 --> 01:03:10.411
I... am accomplished.

01:03:10.495 --> 01:03:12.121
-Yeah.
-It’s pretty incredible.

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.372
-Mm-hmm.
-That’s cool.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:17.919
-Are you okay?
-Hey, do me a favor.

01:03:18.002 --> 01:03:20.254
-Can you look at this on my back for me?
-Sure.

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:23.549
What am I looking for? That mole?
Yeah, I’d get that checked out.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:25.843
No, look for the knife
you stabbed me in the back with

01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:27.136
when you stole my promotion.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:30.556
I’ve been busting my ass
for three years trying to get this.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:33.142
This has been my plan, Noah. It’s my plan.

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:36.103
-What are you talking about?
-[chuckles]

01:03:36.187 --> 01:03:37.188
That’s good.

01:03:37.271 --> 01:03:40.900
Play dumb and act like it wasn’t me
who got you a job here in the first place.

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:43.152
Me who doctored
your pathetic little résumé.

01:03:43.236 --> 01:03:45.446
I literally begged Costigan
to hire you here.

01:03:45.530 --> 01:03:48.699
Okay. Then there has to be
something that I could do.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.743
You know? I’m the senior VP.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.453
-You’re my best friend--
-“Friend”?

01:03:52.537 --> 01:03:54.539
[laughs] No, no, no, no.

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:58.417
We haven’t been friends for years.
You used to be chill, really cool.

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.546
And then you turned into
a corporate ass-kissing piece of shit!

01:04:01.629 --> 01:04:04.006
So we’re what? Enemies?

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:06.300
Fuck you.

01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:11.639
Oh, uh, can I borrow your pen?

01:04:11.722 --> 01:04:12.974
Yeah.

01:04:17.228 --> 01:04:19.522
[chuckles] I’ll leave you two.

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.191
I lied.

01:04:31.409 --> 01:04:32.910
[phone ringing]

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:35.872
Oh, my God.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.208
It’s just from stress eating.

01:04:42.503 --> 01:04:47.008
Oh. Um, sorry to bother you, sir,
but you shouldn’t be in here right now.

01:04:47.091 --> 01:04:49.760
You’re 20 minutes late
for the meeting with the Avalon execs.

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.180
You know what? I think-- [smacks lips]

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:56.100
I am gonna need an hour of personal time.

01:04:56.183 --> 01:04:57.852
-Thank you.
-Uh, it’s--

01:04:57.935 --> 01:04:59.186
[chuckles] That’s impossible.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.398
Closing this deal will pay for
your wedding and your honeymoon in Fiji.

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:04.358
I’m gonna go to Fiji with Avery?

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:07.486
That would be pretty awesome.
When will this meeting be over with?

01:05:07.570 --> 01:05:08.738
-In an hour.
-Good.

01:05:08.821 --> 01:05:11.782
-Then you have your flight to Charlotte.
-I’m going to North Carolina today?

01:05:11.866 --> 01:05:13.910
You return late afternoon,
and then you prep for--

01:05:13.993 --> 01:05:16.203
Just let me see that. What is this?

01:05:16.287 --> 01:05:19.415
It says that I’m booked every day
for the next three months.

01:05:19.498 --> 01:05:23.711
What if I bailed on that business trip
and took a very well-deserved half day?

01:05:23.794 --> 01:05:27.840
Sir, no. You would be fired instantly.
Seriously, do not do that.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.426
Remember Davis? He’s homeless now.

01:05:30.509 --> 01:05:33.346
I drive by his tent
on the way to work every day.

01:05:33.429 --> 01:05:37.934
It’s kind of cute. He’s got his dog
out there and everything, but... [laughs]

01:05:38.684 --> 01:05:41.479
Anyways, congrats on your engagement.
You’re a lucky man.

01:05:41.562 --> 01:05:44.815
I’d like to go over a couple of quick
scheduling changes that you’ve got.

01:05:44.899 --> 01:05:46.192

I made it. I made it.

01:05:54.241 --> 01:05:56.702
So, sorry I’m late.
Have you guys seen Avery?

01:05:56.786 --> 01:05:58.496
Sorry I’m late. Have you seen--?

01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:01.123
Those snacks look good,
but I can’t have any.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:04.210
I’m putting myself on a diet.
Have you guys seen Avery at all?

01:06:04.752 --> 01:06:06.963
Avery’s parents. Really nice to meet you.

01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:08.047
-Meet us?
-Again.

01:06:08.130 --> 01:06:11.300
Nice to-- It’s good to see you.
Honestly, it’s good to see you.

01:06:11.384 --> 01:06:14.053
Cousin Shannon.
Wow, you do look like Garth.

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:15.304
I could tell.

01:06:15.388 --> 01:06:16.889
-Thank you.

01:06:18.432 --> 01:06:20.518
Wow. Okay.

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:26.273
Well, now that I have your attention,
if anyone has seen my beautiful fiancée,

01:06:26.357 --> 01:06:31.237
please let her know that her presence
is requested at the piano,

01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.239
where I would like to kick things off

01:06:33.322 --> 01:06:36.117
with a song that I played for Avery
on the night we first met.

01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:37.952
Ohhh.

01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:39.704

Is the piano out of tune? Something...

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:59.265

But, you know, the jet lag is kicking in.

01:07:12.278 --> 01:07:16.240
As soon as Avery joins the duet,
I feel that I will have my groove back.

01:07:16.323 --> 01:07:18.451
Has anyone seen Avery, by the way?

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:20.286
Hey, dude.

01:07:21.078 --> 01:07:23.080
-That was beautiful.
-Thank you.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.874
-I don’t believe when you say that.
-Good.

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:27.418
Been a while since I’ve played.
Have you seen Avery anywhere?

01:07:27.501 --> 01:07:28.627
She’s with Ethan.

01:07:29.336 --> 01:07:30.504
What?

01:07:31.505 --> 01:07:33.340
Holy shit. What happened to him?

01:07:33.424 --> 01:07:36.385
We think it might have been the taquitos.
Right, Ethan?

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:38.804
So what happened? [sighs]

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:42.141
Did your flight get delayed,
or did you hit traffic?

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:44.977
I am so sorry.
I truly tried to get here as fast as--

01:07:45.061 --> 01:07:46.854
Okay, why is he here exactly?

01:07:46.937 --> 01:07:48.939
I’m-I’m leaving anyway.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:52.568
Um, don’t eat the taquitos
or seven-layer dip.

01:07:52.651 --> 01:07:55.696
Poor thing, wait. You wanna lay down
on our bed for a minute?

01:07:55.780 --> 01:07:58.407
I think he wants to probably lay down
in his own bed.

01:07:58.491 --> 01:08:00.159
Here. Here you go, big guy.

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:02.495
We’ll get you some fresh air,
some Pepto chewables.

01:08:02.578 --> 01:08:04.747
I have ’em in the glove compartment,
so I’ll take him.

01:08:04.830 --> 01:08:08.042
Are you sure? But you just got here.
I’m sure everybody wants to say hi.

01:08:08.125 --> 01:08:10.294
-Maybe Carrie can take him home.
-It’ll be quick.

01:08:10.377 --> 01:08:12.713
-So-- You look so good, by the way.
-Thank you.

01:08:13.422 --> 01:08:15.966
-Thanks.
-I love you so much.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.852
Okay. Let’s go ahead and get you home.

01:08:27.603 --> 01:08:28.813
Forever.

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.486
Please don’t puke in my back seat.

01:08:40.116 --> 01:08:41.117
Um--

01:08:41.992 --> 01:08:43.494
Look, I’m sorry. I’m--

01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:46.330
I mean,
those taquitos are a silent killer.

01:08:46.413 --> 01:08:48.874
No. No, it wasn’t the taquitos.

01:08:48.958 --> 01:08:51.752
-Was it the seven-layer dip?
-It was--

01:08:52.253 --> 01:08:55.005
-Look, I made it up. Okay?
-Oh, did you?

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:57.466
Because I’m a liar, okay? I’m no good.

01:08:57.550 --> 01:08:59.176
I even stole a plate.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:01.345
What kind of asshole steals a plate?

01:09:01.428 --> 01:09:04.306
A beautiful plate.
I’ve never stolen anything in my life.

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:09.186
I don’t know what’s come over me.
I’ve just become this... terrible person.

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.771
-You’re too nice.
-No.

01:09:10.855 --> 01:09:12.231
If that makes sense.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.108

01:09:14.191 --> 01:09:17.695
“Ah, Ethan. I don’t really like Ethan,
because he’s such a nice guy.”

01:09:17.778 --> 01:09:19.238
No, I’m not. Okay?

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:22.116
I’ve been coveting thy neighbor’s wife
in my mind.

01:09:22.658 --> 01:09:24.952
Hey, not cool!

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:28.164
It isn’t cool, and I would recommend
that you stop doing that.

01:09:29.456 --> 01:09:31.625
I’m just gonna-- I’m gonna tell you,

01:09:31.709 --> 01:09:36.005
I might have told Avery
that I’m in love with her.

01:09:36.088 --> 01:09:37.089
What? Oh!

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:38.549

Look, I--

01:09:44.763 --> 01:09:46.515
I deserved that.

01:09:46.599 --> 01:09:48.309
Okay? I’m--

01:09:48.392 --> 01:09:49.894
I’m sorry. I--

01:09:50.936 --> 01:09:55.149
I know I have-- I have no right
to say these things. I just--

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.735
Ever since I met her, I’ve felt like...

01:09:58.235 --> 01:10:00.321
you know,
it should have been Avery and me,

01:10:00.404 --> 01:10:03.073
and if I didn’t tell her,
she would never know.

01:10:03.657 --> 01:10:04.617
I’m sorry.

01:10:09.455 --> 01:10:11.290
What did she say when you told her?

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:14.043
She said she wished things were different.

Go ahead, buddy.

01:10:51.205 --> 01:10:52.748
I’m gonna regret this.

01:10:55.542 --> 01:10:56.627
[Carrie] There you are.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:00.089
Avery texted you like ten times.
She went to bed worried.

01:11:00.756 --> 01:11:02.758
Well, I’ve been driving around all night,

01:11:02.841 --> 01:11:05.427
thinking about how I’ve ruined
all of our lives.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.804
At least you kept it light.

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:10.266
Oh, are you okay?

01:11:15.062 --> 01:11:16.647
Why doesn’t Avery love me?

01:11:22.236 --> 01:11:24.238
You’ve known this whole time, haven’t you?

01:11:27.491 --> 01:11:29.201
Why didn’t you say anything?

01:11:30.202 --> 01:11:31.704
[sighs] Um...

01:11:36.792 --> 01:11:39.169
Noah, I know she cares about you.

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.463
Deeply.

01:11:42.756 --> 01:11:44.591
But, no, it’s--

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:46.677
it’s not love.

[exhales]

01:11:49.179 --> 01:11:53.517
And she’ll probably do...
whatever she has to do to make it work.

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:57.271
I just think she doesn’t want to f-fail.

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:02.401
Hey, it’s not you. You’re a good guy.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.446
Sometimes relationships are about...

01:12:06.947 --> 01:12:08.198
intangible things.

-But you’re right.

Yeah.

01:12:39.104 --> 01:12:42.316
And she should be with the right guy,

even though that right guy isn’t me.

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:48.864
So I have to fix it.
I have to go back in time and fix it.

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:48.358
Well, at least I’m not that guy.

01:14:48.442 --> 01:14:51.612
All right, I can guarantee this is
gonna be gross, and you get it first.

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:54.990
Hey, I’m Noah.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:58.035
Carrie. Nice to meet you.

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:05.459
-Do you wanna do shots?
-Uh... yeah.

01:15:05.542 --> 01:15:07.920
Uh... okay. Let’s go.

01:15:08.003 --> 01:15:09.213
-[laughs]
-Come on.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:12.883
Comin’ in.

01:15:12.966 --> 01:15:15.344
Here you go. One for you, one for me.

01:15:15.427 --> 01:15:17.429
Aw! So cute.

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:19.515
-Thank you.
-Scored us the whole bottle.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.976
-What made you come up to me?
-I don’t know.

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.479
I thought that you had a familiar face.

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:28.065
I’m wearing goggles.
You can’t even see me.

01:15:28.148 --> 01:15:29.733
[gasps] I love this song.

01:15:30.734 --> 01:15:31.818
You wanna dance?

01:15:32.569 --> 01:15:33.987
Uh... yeah.

01:15:34.071 --> 01:15:35.739
You think you can handle all this?

01:15:35.822 --> 01:15:38.408

-I can’t.

Looks like this party’s dead.
You wanna go somewhere else?

01:16:28.041 --> 01:16:30.252
Yeah. I think I know a place.

01:16:31.169 --> 01:16:33.422
Let’s go get Ethan and Avery. Should we?

01:16:33.505 --> 01:16:35.424

of course they’d be naturals at that.

They look <i>good</i> together.

01:17:00.699 --> 01:17:01.700
[Noah] They do.

01:17:01.783 --> 01:17:02.909
[Carrie] Cute.

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:04.328
That’s their first kiss.

[playing piano]

01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:15.797
You play piano.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:18.675
I got honorable mention
in a talent show once.

01:17:18.759 --> 01:17:19.926
Oh, really?

01:17:20.552 --> 01:17:22.554
And you play Oscar Peterson.

01:17:23.263 --> 01:17:25.641
Well, you don’t play OP. OP plays you.

01:17:25.724 --> 01:17:27.643
That is true. That is true.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:30.771
[chuckles]

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:35.192
All right. Not bad for Cupid.

01:17:38.403 --> 01:17:40.405
So did Avery get you into him or...?

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:43.867
Avery’s music knowledge
is 100 percent stolen from me.

01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:47.371
If it were up to Avery, she’d be listening
to Jonas Brothers or Linkin Park.

01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:49.164
[laughs]

01:17:49.247 --> 01:17:51.541
Peruse at your own will,
if you want to get schooled.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:52.876
Okay.

-This is your playlist?
-Mm-hmm.

01:17:54.544 --> 01:17:56.546
There are some deep cuts in here.

01:17:58.131 --> 01:17:59.216
So you--

01:17:59.841 --> 01:18:01.343
You’re the one that likes jazz.

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.095
Yes.

01:18:04.596 --> 01:18:07.307
And you like <i>A League of Their Own</i>.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:09.601
I hand-made her costume.

01:18:11.353 --> 01:18:14.898
So the foosball table in your living room
is yours, not Avery’s.

01:18:14.981 --> 01:18:17.275
How’d you know I had a foosball table
in my living room?

01:18:20.195 --> 01:18:21.279
Avery.

01:18:22.072 --> 01:18:23.323
She told me earlier.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:24.783
-Candid.
-[clicks]

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.036
[laughs]

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.747
Right. Um, I’m probably cross-eyed.

01:18:31.248 --> 01:18:32.624
-Hmm.
-No?

01:18:33.333 --> 01:18:35.168
That’s what I look like in my prom photo.

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:37.212
-Oh.
-I know.

01:18:37.295 --> 01:18:39.506
Oh, my God! That is horrible!

01:18:39.589 --> 01:18:41.675
You were actually worse than that.
You were this.

01:18:41.758 --> 01:18:43.677
Wait. Cross-eyed and droopy. Huh?

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:44.803
[chuckles] Oh.

01:18:46.888 --> 01:18:48.849
I-- I think you look good.

01:18:51.852 --> 01:18:53.562
I’m really glad I came out tonight.

01:18:54.271 --> 01:18:55.355
Yeah, me too.

01:18:56.148 --> 01:18:57.733
I almost didn’t.

01:18:57.816 --> 01:18:59.067
Why?

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.696
[sighs] Ah, I’m going through this, like,
really weird breakup.

01:19:03.572 --> 01:19:07.117
I knew he’d be at the party,
and I wasn’t sure how I’d feel about him.

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:11.455
You know, you either want to strangle him,
make out with him, cry in the bathroom.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:15.125
You-- He was at the party?

01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:16.209
Yeah.

01:19:18.044 --> 01:19:20.881
Who was he? Was he the AC/DC guy?

01:19:20.964 --> 01:19:22.507
No. No. But--

01:19:22.591 --> 01:19:24.009
Was he Hulk smash?

01:19:24.092 --> 01:19:26.762
[laughs] No. I believe
you made fun of this guy though.

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:28.263
Jell-O Shot Doctor?

01:19:28.346 --> 01:19:29.806
What?

01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:31.725
I-I-I did not know that.

01:19:32.225 --> 01:19:33.685
That’s all right. How would you know?

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:36.062
You ever keep spinning around
in the same relationship

01:19:36.146 --> 01:19:37.814
over and over and it’s just going nowhere?

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:42.110
Yeah. Yeah, I’ve been
in that relationship before.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.823
Hey! Guys, come take pictures with us!

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:48.408
-Nah.
-Mmm, yeah.

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:50.202
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
-Let’s do it. No, come on.

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:51.703
-Yep.
-Be a team player.

01:19:51.787 --> 01:19:54.122
You’re wearing a jersey,
for Christ’s sake. Come on.

01:19:57.751 --> 01:19:59.044
-[Ethan] Get in here.
-Come on.

01:19:59.127 --> 01:20:00.420
-[Noah] Come on.
-[Avery] Ready?

01:20:00.504 --> 01:20:02.214
-We’re all very happy.
-Whoo!

01:20:02.297 --> 01:20:04.174
-Okay, now we’re a little scared.
-[gasp]

01:20:04.257 --> 01:20:05.509

-[shrieks]

01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:12.557

01:20:35.997 --> 01:20:36.998
[sniffs]

01:20:38.458 --> 01:20:42.337
Aaah! Whoo! On a scale of one to titties,
how epic was last night?

01:20:43.213 --> 01:20:44.714
W-We’re friends, right?

01:20:44.798 --> 01:20:46.716
What are you talking about?
We’re best friends.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:49.344
I mean, technically,
you did go home solo yet again,

01:20:49.427 --> 01:20:51.888
but what’s important is
we shared a kick-ass experience.

01:20:51.972 --> 01:20:55.517
I brought home Haley, the dietitian.
Old soul.

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:56.726
Hey, where’s Avery?

01:20:56.810 --> 01:20:58.937
Avery’s probably with Ethan.

01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:01.147
-So they’re dating?
-Yep. Engaged.

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:02.732
So, um...

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:04.943
where’s Carrie?

01:21:05.026 --> 01:21:06.611
Her friend?

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:09.281
Uh, I don’t know.
I haven’t seen her in a few years.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.616
You said she got back with her ex
and fell off your radar.

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.076
What’s with all the questions, bro?

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:15.036
Jell-O Shot Doctor?

01:21:16.288 --> 01:21:19.749
No, she says that they--
that-that she doesn’t like him.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:21.835
-So that can’t--
-What’s wrong with you?

01:21:22.502 --> 01:21:24.004
What are you talking about?

01:21:24.087 --> 01:21:25.714
I’m talking about me and Carrie, Max.

01:21:25.797 --> 01:21:27.549
I-I’m talking about fate.

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:29.759
Fate is a tricky lady.

01:21:29.843 --> 01:21:32.220
When you try to figure her out,
you just get more confused.

01:21:32.304 --> 01:21:36.057
All I know is the mistakes I’ve made
and the ladies I’ve laid

01:21:36.141 --> 01:21:38.184
have made me who I am today.

01:21:38.268 --> 01:21:41.062
If I were to go back and
relive it differently, I wouldn’t be me.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:42.147
And I like me.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:44.524
I thought things were supposed to happen
for a reason.

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:46.151
That’s what strippers and idiots say.

01:21:46.234 --> 01:21:49.779
Things happen randomly
for no reason at all.

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:51.489
But they create opportunities, Noah.

01:21:51.573 --> 01:21:54.534
And you learn from those opportunities,
even the missed ones.

01:21:54.618 --> 01:21:57.746
The question is,
can you recognize that next opportunity

01:21:57.829 --> 01:21:59.581
when it matters the most?

01:22:01.166 --> 01:22:03.919
I’ve been watching these speeches online.
Really inspirational.

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.004
This kid, 15 years old.

01:22:06.546 --> 01:22:08.131
Not a lot of subscribers, but--

01:22:08.214 --> 01:22:09.633
-[door opens]
-Noah!

01:22:09.716 --> 01:22:11.927
I made us breakfast,
most important meal of the day!

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.011
-Gotta go!
-[door closes]

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:27.025
-Noah?
-Wow.

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:30.612
Hey, you just missed Avery and Ethan.
Everything okay?

01:22:31.404 --> 01:22:33.406
Carrie, for the past three years,

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:36.242
I’ve been pining over
what I thought was destiny,

01:22:36.326 --> 01:22:40.705
but no matter what I would do,
Ethan would end up connecting with Avery,

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:44.334
and I would always seem
to connect with you.

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:47.629
’Cause this whole time,
it was meant to be me and you.

01:22:49.089 --> 01:22:49.923
Wasn’t it?

01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:56.930
-What the hell are you doing?
-What do you mean?

01:22:57.013 --> 01:22:58.890
-Jesus!
-Okay, I thought--

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:01.977
I thought this was the moment
that-that-that--

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:05.271
when our mutual feelings
would come together and...

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:08.358
blossom.

01:23:08.441 --> 01:23:09.985
What are you talking about?

01:23:10.068 --> 01:23:12.696
-We’ve barely hung out.
-That’s not true, exactly.

01:23:12.779 --> 01:23:15.198
A long time ago, we met at that party.

01:23:15.281 --> 01:23:18.618
We had a great time, I wound up getting
back together with my ex-boyfriend.

01:23:18.702 --> 01:23:20.787
Yeah. Why did you do that?

01:23:22.163 --> 01:23:23.623
What kind of question is that?

01:23:23.707 --> 01:23:26.126
There’s been times when you’ve hated me,

01:23:26.209 --> 01:23:28.753
and there’s been times
when you’ve hit me with trees.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:31.047
And then there’s been times

01:23:31.131 --> 01:23:33.883
when... you’ve been my only friend.

01:23:34.926 --> 01:23:38.054
And there has to be one moment
over the past three years

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:39.639
where you thought about us.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:41.850
And you wondered.

01:23:44.352 --> 01:23:45.854
Okay, maybe.

01:23:45.937 --> 01:23:48.356
But... I don’t know.

01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.608
I’m getting ready for a date.

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:52.736
With who? Jell-O shot guy?

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:55.363
-His name is Phil.
-Phil is a stepdad name.

01:23:55.447 --> 01:23:56.656
You ready?

01:23:56.740 --> 01:23:58.116
What’s up, player? Phil.

01:23:59.284 --> 01:24:01.161
Hey, Phil. Noah.

01:24:01.244 --> 01:24:02.704
-All right. Two minutes?
-Yes.

01:24:02.787 --> 01:24:04.039
[Phil] Cool.

01:24:08.877 --> 01:24:09.878
Well, are you happy?

01:24:14.257 --> 01:24:16.342
You know what? We’re late.

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:20.180
Where you going? Hmm?
Avery and Ethan’s engagement party?

01:24:20.263 --> 01:24:22.432
No, actually, that was last night.

01:24:22.515 --> 01:24:24.559
No, it’s tonight. It’s supposed to be--

01:24:25.685 --> 01:24:27.687
Oh, my God, of course.

01:24:28.772 --> 01:24:31.691
I got Avery and Ethan together
one day earlier this time.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:33.777
So-- Shit!

01:24:33.860 --> 01:24:35.195
-Oh!
-[punches hand]

01:24:35.278 --> 01:24:36.362
Goddamn time travel.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:37.989
What?

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:39.199
You were right.

01:24:39.282 --> 01:24:42.368
Relationships are about intangible things.

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.913
They’re about moments.

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:48.458
The real moments
and who you share them with.

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:51.920
And the realest moments
that I’ve had over the past three years

01:24:52.003 --> 01:24:53.004
have been with you.

01:24:54.672 --> 01:24:59.094
You know, I know you don’t understand,
but I’m gonna fix this. Okay?

01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:03.556
I’m sorry. I-- Bye, Noah.

01:25:10.313 --> 01:25:12.941
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:15.193
Well, hey, hey, yo.

01:25:15.276 --> 01:25:16.778
-Hey, Chad. What’s up?
-Hey, Noah.

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:19.072
-Where’s the photo booth?
-Uh, what photo booth?

01:25:19.155 --> 01:25:20.198
That one.

01:25:21.032 --> 01:25:23.159
-It’s right there.
-No, the one with, like--

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:25.870
-The mahogany, the wood and the--
-Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:28.748
They got rid of it. A while back, man.

01:25:28.832 --> 01:25:29.833
What?

01:25:29.916 --> 01:25:32.252
-Sorry?
-No. [laughs]

01:25:32.335 --> 01:25:33.711
That-That can’t happen.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.506
I-I don’t know what you’re talking about.
[nervous chuckle]

01:25:36.589 --> 01:25:37.507
I’m stuck here.

01:25:37.590 --> 01:25:40.135
The girl I love is dating someone else.
Is that what you’re saying?

01:25:40.218 --> 01:25:42.679
[chuckles] Yeah. Story of my life.

01:25:42.762 --> 01:25:46.099
No, it’s not the story of your life,
because you’re not a time traveler, Chad!

01:25:49.185 --> 01:25:50.270
Can I get a drink?

01:25:50.353 --> 01:25:53.231

Obviously,
I am taking a personal photo collage

01:26:17.922 --> 01:26:19.674
Okay. [chuckles]

-What are you doing here?
-What do you mean?

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.928
We came to see you play.

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:26.848
And you didn’t show up to our party
last night, so we were worried.

01:26:26.931 --> 01:26:28.516
Hey, buddy. Yikes.

01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:30.351
You need a water? I got you.

01:26:30.435 --> 01:26:31.978
-No. Give me--
-Thanks, honey.

Come on.

01:26:36.774 --> 01:26:38.484

-What are you doing taking photos

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:40.028
in a piece of junk like this?

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.989
Well, it’s the only one they have, so...

01:26:43.072 --> 01:26:45.617
Your photo booth at home
takes way better photos.

01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:46.743
What?

01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:48.036

01:26:48.620 --> 01:26:51.539
Oh, my God. Do you have any idea
what I went through to get that thing?

01:26:53.541 --> 01:26:55.543
-You got me the photo booth?
-Yeah.

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:59.422

It makes perfect sense. I need you.

01:27:09.515 --> 01:27:10.600
What?

01:27:10.683 --> 01:27:13.353
I need you in order to meet Carrie.

01:27:13.436 --> 01:27:15.855

to happen after that.

01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:28.034
I gotta go back

Because everything

01:27:33.748 --> 01:27:36.042
Or maybe it doesn’t.
Or maybe Max was right.

01:27:36.125 --> 01:27:38.169
-Or maybe I’m just a stripper.
-What?

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:40.255
I love you.
I’ll see you at the engagement party.

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.425
[laughs] Oh, my God.

-I don’t think so. He’s very drunk.
