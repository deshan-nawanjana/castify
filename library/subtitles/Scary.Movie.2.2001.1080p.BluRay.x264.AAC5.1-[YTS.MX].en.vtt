She kept it coming

1799
01:18:36.863 --> 01:18:38.906
It was hypnotic and so erotic

1800
01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:40.366
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1801
01:18:40.408 --> 01:18:41.826
She kept it coming

1802
01:18:41.868 --> 01:18:44.078
It was hypnotic,
she was so erotic

1803
01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:45.622
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1804
01:18:45.663 --> 01:18:46.997
She kept it coming

1805
01:18:46.998 --> 01:18:49.250
It was hypnotic and so erotic

1806
01:18:49.292 --> 01:18:50.668
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1807
01:18:50.710 --> 01:18:52.045
She kept it coming

1808
01:18:52.086 --> 01:18:54.422
It was hypnotic and so erotic

1809
01:18:54.464 --> 01:18:56.090
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1810
01:18:56.132 --> 01:18:57.467
She kept it coming

1811
01:18:57.508 --> 01:18:59.594
It was hypnotic and so erotic

1812
01:18:59.636 --> 01:19:01.512
I tried,
but I just couldn't stop it

1813
01:19:01.513 --> 01:19:03.389
She kept it coming

1814
01:19:06.684 --> 01:19:09.145
She kept it coming

1815
01:19:09.187 --> 01:19:12.065
[ New song begins ]

1816
01:19:17.195 --> 01:19:23.952
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1817
01:19:23.993 --> 01:19:28.665
All my fears arise

1818
01:19:28.706 --> 01:19:33.586
When it's dark outside

1819
01:19:33.628 --> 01:19:36.923
All my fears

1820
01:19:36.965 --> 01:19:41.844
Sun's gone down,
the light's all gone

1821
01:19:41.886 --> 01:19:46.432
Big-ass house
and we're alone

1822
01:19:46.474 --> 01:19:48.768
I hear voices,
what I'm-a do?

1823
01:19:48.810 --> 01:19:51.187
Hear those noises,
what I'm-a do?

1824
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:54.023
What's my choice here,
run like a fool?

1825
01:19:54.065 --> 01:19:56.693
I'm long gone

1826
01:19:56.734 --> 01:19:58.736
- Shh.
- What's that sound?

1827
01:19:58.778 --> 01:20:01.197
Everybody look
what's floating round

1828
01:20:01.239 --> 01:20:03.199
Not too sure of what I see

1829
01:20:03.241 --> 01:20:05.827
All I know is it's scaring me

1830
01:20:05.868 --> 01:20:12.417
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1831
01:20:12.458 --> 01:20:17.171
All my fears arise

1832
01:20:17.255 --> 01:20:22.093
When it's dark outside

1833
01:20:22.135 --> 01:20:25.555
All my fears

1834
01:20:25.596 --> 01:20:27.932
And just when
you think it's over

1835
01:20:27.974 --> 01:20:32.770
Some new sound
is coming towards me

1836
01:20:32.812 --> 01:20:34.856
Getting loud

1837
01:20:34.897 --> 01:20:37.275
I hear noises,
where I'm-a go?

1838
01:20:37.317 --> 01:20:39.777
Hear those voices,
head for the door

1839
01:20:39.819 --> 01:20:42.488
What's my plan?
Don't know anymore

1840
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:45.283
Something's wrong

1841
01:20:45.325 --> 01:20:47.035
- Shh.
- What's that sound?

1842
01:20:47.076 --> 01:20:49.996
Everybody look
what's going down

1843
01:20:50.038 --> 01:20:51.998
And why won't you let me be?

1844
01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:54.459
Go right now, you're scaring me

1845
01:20:54.500 --> 01:21:01.007
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1846
01:21:01.049 --> 01:21:05.762
All my fears arise

1847
01:21:05.803 --> 01:21:10.600
When it's dark outside

1848
01:21:10.642 --> 01:21:13.895
All my fears

1849
01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:20.485
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1850
01:21:20.526 --> 01:21:25.239
All my fears arise

1851
01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:30.078
When it's dark outside

1852
01:21:30.119 --> 01:21:34.415
All my fears

1853
01:21:34.457 --> 01:21:36.167
Here's something, so get back

1854
01:21:36.209 --> 01:21:38.670
Shorty looking at me like,
"Yo, let me hit that"

1855
01:21:38.711 --> 01:21:40.797
Footsteps in the dark,
whatcha gone do?

1856
01:21:40.838 --> 01:21:41.881
I was talking to this chicken

1857
01:21:41.965 --> 01:21:43.341
Oh. Shit.

1858
01:21:43.383 --> 01:21:44.425
Is this a poltergeist
or a heist?

1859
01:21:44.467 --> 01:21:45.843
She robs some

1860
01:21:45.885 --> 01:21:47.053
All the jewels, murdering tools

1861
01:21:47.095 --> 01:21:48.096
We got some

1862
01:21:48.137 --> 01:21:49.180
Like cha-cha

1863
01:21:49.222 --> 01:21:50.431
Ready to open up shop

1864
01:21:50.473 --> 01:21:51.557
Wreak havoc on the block

1865
01:21:51.599 --> 01:21:52.684
Now love it, don't stop

1866
01:21:52.725 --> 01:21:54.060
Come on

1867
01:21:54.102 --> 01:21:59.774
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1868
01:21:59.816 --> 01:22:03.236
All my fears arise

1869
01:22:03.278 --> 01:22:09.616
Ooh, when it's dark outside

1870
01:22:09.617 --> 01:22:14.330
All my fears arise

1871
01:22:14.372 --> 01:22:17.168
When it's dark outside.
