as soon as he saw you.

- Jim.

You think a kid wants to have sex with you
in your current condition?

- Just opened a beer.

00:11:15.467 --> 00:11:17.386
Go to the sea.

00:11:17.386 --> 00:11:20.639

- Go in the ocean.

I know you were looking for someone

I'm assuming that I'm here
because you haven't found anyone yet,

00:14:49.765 --> 00:14:51.850
and the reason
you haven't found anyone yet

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:54.978
is because young girls are idiots.

00:14:54.978 --> 00:14:56.855
That's not their fault. They're young.

Percy is so loving,
and he is so sensitive,

00:15:23.549 --> 00:15:25.634
and he's extremely bright.

Oh, I've heard of it.

00:15:29.179 --> 00:15:31.473
He's an amazing musician,
but he won't play for anyone.

He's just having
a lot of trouble socially.

00:15:34.309 --> 00:15:35.644
You know, and as a mother,

00:15:35.644 --> 00:15:38.564
that's just been really hard to watch
these past four years.

00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:41.900
He's always on his phone,
doesn't come out of his room,

he doesn't have any friends,
he doesn't talk to girls.

Doesn't drink, doesn't go to parties,
doesn't drive.

Yeah. We didn't come by this easily.

We tried everything
to bring him out of his shell.

00:16:09.011 --> 00:16:12.431
- We're at the end of our rope.
- I was shy when I was Percy's age.

00:16:12.431 --> 00:16:15.350
But I dated this girl
right before I went to college,

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.728
and she really opened me up sexually.

00:16:17.728 --> 00:16:18.645
Okay.

- Mm-mm.

00:16:19.605 --> 00:16:22.274
Anyway, by the time I got to college,

00:16:22.274 --> 00:16:25.027
I was out of my shell and thriving.

00:16:25.027 --> 00:16:28.322
- Yes, and that's what we want for Percy.
- Is this him?

00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:29.239
Yes.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:39.499

- That, and we know his passcode.
- Mm-hm.

00:16:45.797 --> 00:16:47.049
And he's not gay?

00:16:47.049 --> 00:16:49.301
No. We've seen his Internet history.

00:16:49.301 --> 00:16:51.929
Yeah, the porn is graphic, but not gay.

00:16:51.929 --> 00:16:55.265
A little gay. Large groups of people.

00:16:55.265 --> 00:16:56.558
[Maddie] Hm.

00:16:56.558 --> 00:17:00.938
Not to look a gift horse in the mouth,
but does it have to be a Buick?

00:17:01.855 --> 00:17:03.899
- It's just what Dad drove.
- [Maddie] Mm.

00:17:03.899 --> 00:17:07.694
Okay, then, why don't you date Percy
and the Buick is yours?

00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.571
And don't just "date" him, you know?

00:17:10.571 --> 00:17:12.366
Get to know him, 'cause he's a good kid.

00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:14.785
So when you say date him,

00:17:14.785 --> 00:17:18.079
do you mean date him or date him?

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:20.624
- Yes.
- Yeah, that's correct.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.001
- Date him.
- Date him hard.

00:17:23.001 --> 00:17:24.086
Okay.

00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.213
I'll date his brains out.

00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:28.715
So is he in his room?
Should I jump out and surprise him?

00:17:28.715 --> 00:17:30.634
No. No, no, no. He's not here.

00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:32.928
He can't know about this.
Nobody can know about this.

00:17:32.928 --> 00:17:35.764
Nobody can know about this.

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.851
Also, it would devastate him,
which would defeat the purpose

00:17:38.851 --> 00:17:40.727
of building up his confidence.

00:17:40.727 --> 00:17:42.229
Right. Right.

the organic way...

He was a drug dog for the state police,
but they forced him into retirement

00:20:07.457 --> 00:20:10.669
because he got addicted to C-O-C-A-I-N-E.

just to make sure
you're a suitable candidate.

00:20:28.437 --> 00:20:30.314
We have to do it with everyone.
It's the rules.

00:20:30.314 --> 00:20:32.274
Oh, a little rule follower, huh?

00:20:32.274 --> 00:20:34.568
Yeah, they're super important.

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:37.571
So is there, like,
an office or somewhere private?

00:20:38.989 --> 00:20:40.032
An office.

00:20:40.032 --> 00:20:41.825

- Great.

00:30:45.095 --> 00:30:45.971
[sighs]

00:30:45.971 --> 00:30:48.432
You're right.
I should've been more specific.

00:30:48.432 --> 00:30:49.850
["Maneater" playing over speakers]

00:30:49.850 --> 00:30:52.686
I used to have nightmares about this song
when I was a kid.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.354
Why?

00:30:54.354 --> 00:30:57.608
'Cause it's about a monster.
A man-eater.

00:30:58.442 --> 00:31:02.738
"She only comes out at night.
Watch out, boy. She'll chew you up."

00:31:04.323 --> 00:31:06.283
I don't think
that's what the song is about.

00:31:06.283 --> 00:31:07.492
I'll look into that.

00:31:07.492 --> 00:31:10.537
Long Island iced tea
for America's sweetheart,

00:31:10.537 --> 00:31:11.747
and one for the boy.

00:31:11.747 --> 00:31:13.999
Oh, uh, good news, by the way.

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:15.792
Um, we got some new dogs in today.

00:31:15.792 --> 00:31:17.753
So, you know, if you're still looking...

00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:21.757
[Percy groans]

00:31:21.757 --> 00:31:23.759
This is the worst iced tea I've ever had.

00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:25.511
Percy, you're going to college soon.

00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:27.596
You're gonna have to learn how to drink.

00:31:27.596 --> 00:31:29.723
You can't go your whole life
scared of everything.

00:31:29.723 --> 00:31:31.642
I'm not scared of everything.

00:31:31.642 --> 00:31:33.185
Come on. Open up.

00:31:33.185 --> 00:31:34.436
Have your medicine.

00:31:34.436 --> 00:31:36.271
- Come on, baby bird.
- I don't like it.

00:31:36.271 --> 00:31:37.940
- Oh, shit.
- Well, well,

00:31:37.940 --> 00:31:40.192
look at what the tide dragged in.

00:31:41.276 --> 00:31:42.319
Hello, Travis.

00:31:43.237 --> 00:31:45.572
Well, I don't know if you heard,
but, uh...

00:31:45.572 --> 00:31:47.282
[clicking tongue]

00:31:47.282 --> 00:31:48.825
That's great. Congratulations.

00:31:48.825 --> 00:31:50.786
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. Thank you.

00:31:51.495 --> 00:31:54.206
Turns out your little disappearing act,

00:31:54.206 --> 00:31:56.333
that was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:31:56.333 --> 00:31:58.627
Well, I'm happy I could help.

00:31:58.627 --> 00:31:59.753
You know...

00:32:01.046 --> 00:32:05.467
my wife, she speaks three languages.

00:32:05.467 --> 00:32:07.970
She's hot as fuck. The sex is incredible.

00:32:09.304 --> 00:32:11.515
We do everything together. All of it.

00:32:11.515 --> 00:32:13.851
That's great.
Is her vagina dishwasher-safe?

00:32:13.851 --> 00:32:14.768
No.

00:32:16.019 --> 00:32:17.312
She's a real person.

00:32:18.272 --> 00:32:19.398
Unlike you.

00:32:20.023 --> 00:32:22.067
You wanna know what the best part is?

00:32:22.818 --> 00:32:24.528
When I told her that I loved her,

00:32:25.237 --> 00:32:28.323
she said it back to me
instead of running away.

00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:30.409
Like a coward.

00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:32.703
That must've been
a really exciting second date.

00:32:32.703 --> 00:32:33.996
[scoffs]

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:38.917
[Travis laughs]

00:32:38.917 --> 00:32:41.545
- You better be careful of this one.
- [Percy] Mm.

00:32:42.588 --> 00:32:43.922
She is slippery.

00:32:43.922 --> 00:32:46.550
Bye-bye. Bye, Travis.

00:32:48.635 --> 00:32:51.180
- Is that your ex-boyfriend?
- More like a friend.

00:32:51.972 --> 00:32:54.016
It felt like you didn't really like him.

00:32:54.016 --> 00:32:57.811
- You met him. Do you like him?
- I didn't have sex with him.

00:32:57.811 --> 00:33:00.147
Do you want to? I can call him back over.

00:33:00.147 --> 00:33:02.274
- Hey, Travis.
- No, no, no. No.

00:33:02.983 --> 00:33:04.484
I don't wanna do that. I just...

00:33:04.484 --> 00:33:06.737
I don't know
why you'd have sex with someone

00:33:06.737 --> 00:33:07.946
if you don't like them.

00:33:07.946 --> 00:33:10.616
It was Christmas, I was lonely.
I don't know.

00:33:10.616 --> 00:33:12.409
Why'd you disappear on him?

00:33:12.409 --> 00:33:14.953
What's with the questions?
Can't we just get drunk and have fun?

00:33:14.953 --> 00:33:17.581
Oh, sorry. Just trying to get to know you.

00:33:20.417 --> 00:33:23.003
- Do you wanna get out of here?
- Yes. Please.

00:33:24.171 --> 00:33:25.631
I think I'm a little drunk.

00:33:25.631 --> 00:33:27.799
Yeah, you've been drinking a lot.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:29.551
No, I wasn't.

00:33:30.511 --> 00:33:32.262
God, I love the beach.

00:33:32.262 --> 00:33:34.723
I just feel so free out here. Don't you?

00:33:34.723 --> 00:33:36.725
Um... yeah.

00:33:37.601 --> 00:33:41.063
I think it's closed, though.
Oh, it's after 8, so...

00:33:42.105 --> 00:33:44.858
We could come back during operating hours.

00:33:44.858 --> 00:33:48.320
- We got the whole place to ourselves.
- Lots of red flags.

00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.948
- Let's go swimming.
- There's no lifeguards.

00:33:51.907 --> 00:33:53.909
Perfect. We can go skinny-dipping.

00:33:55.202 --> 00:33:56.912
Oh, look, no swimming.

00:33:57.788 --> 00:33:59.122
Oh, we tried.

00:33:59.748 --> 00:34:03.418
You know, those rules are
more like just suggestions.

00:34:04.127 --> 00:34:06.380
Come on, let's get you
out of these Daisy Dukes.

00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:08.882
[laughs] Maddie, I don't know.

00:34:11.134 --> 00:34:13.594
I'm ugly to you. I knew it.

00:34:13.594 --> 00:34:15.138
- I knew it.
- What?

00:34:16.764 --> 00:34:17.599
No.

00:34:19.309 --> 00:34:20.978
- No.
- Seems like it.

00:34:20.978 --> 00:34:21.895
No, I...

00:34:23.688 --> 00:34:25.107
I think you're the...

00:34:25.107 --> 00:34:27.275
I think you're the prettiest person
I've ever seen.

00:34:28.402 --> 00:34:29.235
Really?

00:34:30.279 --> 00:34:31.112
Pretty where?

00:34:31.737 --> 00:34:34.741
[sultry music playing]

00:34:37.077 --> 00:34:38.078
Pretty here?

00:34:41.290 --> 00:34:43.917
Or pretty here?

00:34:51.592 --> 00:34:52.801
What about sharks?

00:34:53.342 --> 00:34:54.344
None here.

00:34:56.513 --> 00:34:57.848
Not in season.

00:34:57.848 --> 00:35:00.893
It's really the lack of lifeguards
that's causing an issue for me.

00:35:00.893 --> 00:35:04.271
- Just get the fuck in here right now!
- Okay! Okay. Okay.

00:35:05.105 --> 00:35:07.858

I promise nothing's gonna happen.

- I don't know.

Hey, what you up to over there?

00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.361
Just doing our taxes.

00:35:54.488 --> 00:35:56.532
Yeah, no need to fold them.

I don't like this.
Something's really wrong with you.

our keys, our wallets.

What would you have done? Nothing?

Forty years?
And that's how old you are, right?

No.

- You guys aren't gonna ask us how we met?

01:13:49.805 --> 01:13:51.265
Oh. How'd you meet?

01:13:51.265 --> 01:13:54.351
Do you wanna tell them?
No, I'll tell them. This is so us.

01:13:54.351 --> 01:13:55.936
It's actually really random.

01:13:55.936 --> 01:13:57.896
- Maddie came in to adopt a dog.
- Oh!

01:13:57.896 --> 01:14:02.401
Yeah, but I rejected her application
because she was totally unqualified.

01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:03.694
But we still hit it off.

01:14:03.694 --> 01:14:05.904
I mean, the first day we met,
I had to Mace her,

01:14:05.904 --> 01:14:07.072
she was so fucking horny.

01:14:07.072 --> 01:14:08.866

01:14:08.866 --> 01:14:11.285
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:14.746
We actually have a lot in common.
In four years, we'll both be seniors.

01:14:14.746 --> 01:14:16.707
- [cell phone buzzing]
- Oh.

01:14:16.707 --> 01:14:18.625
Oh, I'm so-- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

01:14:18.625 --> 01:14:21.086

but keep getting to know each other,

01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:23.714

[mischievous music playing]

01:14:33.932 --> 01:14:34.766

01:14:34.766 --> 01:14:36.977
We need to move fast.
We're in the middle of dinner.

01:14:36.977 --> 01:14:40.397
- What are you having?
- Roasted chicken and salad.

01:14:40.397 --> 01:14:42.357
I fucking love salad.

01:14:50.949 --> 01:14:52.701
She's gonna hate not having hubcaps.

01:14:58.665 --> 01:14:59.750
It's very simple.

01:14:59.750 --> 01:15:03.170
She broke your heart, you break the car,
since that's all she cares about.

01:15:04.546 --> 01:15:06.757
She was just like
every other thing in my life:

01:15:07.382 --> 01:15:08.967
Planned by my parents.

Hey.

How we doing?

01:16:10.529 --> 01:16:11.655
Where were you?

01:16:15.367 --> 01:16:16.660
You okay? I--

01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.871
Percy, your parents are downstairs.

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:21.081
I really don't think they mind.

01:16:21.748 --> 01:16:26.461
- Well, can we just talk? God!
- Stop. What's--? Ow. Ow! My wrist.

What's going on?

01:16:37.097 --> 01:16:38.473
I'm just a little confused.

01:16:39.057 --> 01:16:40.142
Because I--

01:16:40.142 --> 01:16:42.686
Because I thought you wanted
to have sex with me.

01:16:43.312 --> 01:16:44.229
So...

01:16:44.229 --> 01:16:48.150
If there's something I don't know,
just tell me.

01:16:51.028 --> 01:16:52.112
No.

This is what you want?
This will make you happy?

01:17:05.042 --> 01:17:07.085
Yeah. Yep.

- Okay. And now...

I had some kind of stupid idea
that you actually liked me.

Percy.

01:18:41.096 --> 01:18:42.556

01:18:42.556 --> 01:18:43.849
Yes.

01:18:44.600 --> 01:18:47.519
It is real. I've told you things
I've never told anybody.

01:18:49.438 --> 01:18:53.233
I was just trying to save my house.
It wasn't personal.

It felt personal to me.

and I'll come back to visit Montauk
and you'll still be here.

Why don't you go ask them?
I know you guys are close.

01:19:38.070 --> 01:19:40.656
But you're rich, right?
You never have to worry about money.

01:19:42.157 --> 01:19:45.202
So my life is amazing, right?
I have no problems.

01:19:45.202 --> 01:19:46.828
I'm gonna lose my house.

01:19:49.122 --> 01:19:51.542
And I don't have a rich dad
that can help me.

01:19:51.542 --> 01:19:52.918
Actually, Maddie, you do.

01:19:52.918 --> 01:19:54.878

your life in that house

and apologize.

It's your car.

what to do anymore. I'm the parents now.

to go to military school.
