00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:22.442
- Hello.
- Wanna have a little fun?

2
00:00:22.568 --> 00:00:25.693
- Who's this?
- Tell me your name and I'll tell you mine.

3
00:00:25.818 --> 00:00:27.736
I don't think so.

4
00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:30.779
- What's that noise?
- Oops. I farted.

5
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:34.113
- I didn't think you would hear me.
- No, that popping noise.

6
00:00:34.238 --> 00:00:37.948
Oh. I'm making popcorn.
I'm getting ready to watch a video.

7
00:00:38.073 --> 00:00:41.740
- Ooh. What is it?
- It's just a scary movie.

8
00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.825
- Do you like scary movies?
- Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.159
- What's your favorite?
- Mm, I don't know.

10
00:00:47.243 --> 00:00:49.161
Think.

11
00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:52.786
Oh, I know. Um, Kazaam,
the one where Shaq plays a genie.

12
00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:56.246
- That's not a horror movie.
- Well, you haven't seen Shaq act.

13
00:00:58.122 --> 00:01:01.205
- Hey, you have a nice voice.
- Thanks.

14
00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:03.457
You never did tell me your name.

15
00:01:03.582 --> 00:01:05.792
Why do you wanna know my name?

16
00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:08.583
Cause I wanna know
who I'm looking at.

17
00:01:10.293 --> 00:01:12.418
What--
What did you say?

18
00:01:12.502 --> 00:01:14.753
Nice breasts.

19
00:01:14.877 --> 00:01:16.753
Look, what do you want?

20
00:01:16.878 --> 00:01:19.547
I wanna see
what your insides look like.

21
00:01:19.671 --> 00:01:22.046
Well-- Well, then,
turn to page 54.

22
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.756
Oh.

23
00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:25.756
Hey, nice.

24
00:01:27.589 --> 00:01:31.716
Listen, asshole, you've had your fun,
now you better stop or else.

25
00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:34.885
- Or else what?
- Or else my boyfriends
gonna be here any minute,

26
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.053
and he's black
and he'll kick your ass.

27
00:01:37.135 --> 00:01:39.054
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

28
00:01:39.137 --> 00:01:41.262
You mean the one who wears makeup
and dresses like a woman?

29
00:01:41.387 --> 00:01:44.389
- How did you know?
- Turn the porch lights on.

30
00:01:50.558 --> 00:01:53.640
Help! Help!

31
00:01:53.724 --> 00:01:55.955
Oh, that's not my boyfriend.
I mean, I've

32
00:01:55.956 --> 00:01:58.185
fucked him a couple of
times, but that's it.

33
00:01:58.267 --> 00:02:01.519
Look, I'm calling the cops.

34
00:02:01.602 --> 00:02:03.811
Go ahead. Call the cops.

35
00:02:03.894 --> 00:02:06.938
But you might wanna
check the back door first.

36
00:02:07.063 --> 00:02:09.063
You forgot to lock it.

37
00:02:32.113 --> 00:02:34.030
Take that, you psycho!

38
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.365
I cant feel my legs.

39
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.950
I think my arm is broken.

40
00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:45.618
- Sorry.
- I want my mommy.

41
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.579
Hello, Drew.

42
00:03:08.085 --> 00:03:09.960
Oh, God!

43
00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:14.149
- Daddy! Daddy!
- Ugh!

44
00:04:14.274 --> 00:04:16.859
Daddy!

45
00:04:16.943 --> 00:04:19.276
Daddy!

46
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.486
Daddy, no! No!

47
00:04:24.445 --> 00:04:27.446
- Did you hear something?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

48
00:04:53.997 --> 00:04:58.791
Bobby, what are you doing?
My dads in the other room.

49
00:04:58.874 --> 00:05:01.541
It just occurred to me. I never
climbed through your window before.

50
00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:05.209
Now that you got it out of your system,
Bobby, you have to leave.

51
00:05:05.292 --> 00:05:06.542
Why?

52
00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:08.918
Shh. Come on.

53
00:05:09.044 --> 00:05:10.961
What's going on in there?

54
00:05:11.044 --> 00:05:14.337
Ow! Daddy's head is stuck.
Unstick Daddy's head.

55
00:05:14.462 --> 00:05:17.421
Dad, can you knock?

56
00:05:17.546 --> 00:05:21.964
- Knock?
I thought I heard screaming in here.
- No. No, you didn't, Dad.

57
00:05:22.048 --> 00:05:24.674
Well, it could've been that crack
I smoked earlier, I guess.

58
00:05:24.799 --> 00:05:26.634
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what it was.

59
00:05:26.716 --> 00:05:28.760
I gotta leave town
for a couple of days.

60
00:05:28.885 --> 00:05:31.635
No big deal. Just that new business
I started with those Colombian guys?

61
00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:34.512
- Oh, you mean Uncle Escobar.
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

62
00:05:34.637 --> 00:05:36.971
Well, there's a problem.
Some money went missing.

63
00:05:37.053 --> 00:05:39.097
And apparently,
some legs are gonna get broken.

64
00:05:39.222 --> 00:05:41.597
It's just better if I lay low
for a couple of days.

65
00:05:41.721 --> 00:05:44.098
- If the cops raid the place--
- I never heard of you.

66
00:05:44.223 --> 00:05:46.557
- And don't forget--
- To flush your stash.

67
00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:49.475
Oh, you are my little girl.
I love you so much...

68
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.600
that I left you a little something
in the coffee can.

69
00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:55.310
- Dad--
- But you have to remember to step
on it before you sell it.

70
00:05:55.435 --> 00:05:58.352
- Now, what are you
gonna cut it with?
- Um, baking--

71
00:05:58.435 --> 00:06:00.354
Baking soda.
Not baking powder.

72
00:06:00.436 --> 00:06:03.480
Because baking powder guys
will have muffins growing
out of their nose.

73
00:06:03.562 --> 00:06:05.813
You love that joke,
don't you, honey?

74
00:06:05.898 --> 00:06:09.107
You've loved that joke
since you were two years old.

75
00:06:09.232 --> 00:06:11.315
- Okay, well--
- Okay, I love you.

76
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:13.400
- I love you.
- Have a good trip.

77
00:06:13.483 --> 00:06:15.942
- Bye.
- Bye. Whew!

78
00:06:16.027 --> 00:06:18.234
Is the coast clear?

79
00:06:18.318 --> 00:06:21.486
Oh, Cindy, that nightgown.

80
00:06:21.611 --> 00:06:24.780
That was close. God!

81
00:06:27.988 --> 00:06:32.865
I was, uh, home watching
The Exorcist, and it
got me thinking about you.

82
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.032
If this is about the
time I puked green

83
00:06:35.033 --> 00:06:37.074
slime and masturbated
with a crucifix--

84
00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.367
It was my first keg party, Bobby.

85
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:43.952
No. No. Uh, it was edited for TV.
All the good stuff was cut out.

86
00:06:44.077 --> 00:06:46.953
So you thought you would just climb
through my window...

87
00:06:47.078 --> 00:06:49.078
and we would
play bump-bump?

88
00:06:49.203 --> 00:06:51.247
I was kind of hoping
to get my balls licked,

89
00:06:51.372 --> 00:06:54.040
but I wouldn't wanna break
your little underwear rule,
now, would I?

90
00:06:54.164 --> 00:06:57.456
So maybe just some
on-top-of-the-clothes type stuff?

91
00:07:00.793 --> 00:07:03.668
Okay. But just for a minute.

92
00:07:18.964 --> 00:07:21.257
What the--

93
00:07:21.341 --> 00:07:23.300
Wrong set.

94
00:07:26.884 --> 00:07:30.468
Bobby! Oh, Bobby!

95
00:07:30.553 --> 00:07:33.678
I don't wanna wait
for our lives to be over

96
00:07:33.803 --> 00:07:35.929
- No, Bobby, don't.
- Ow!

97
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.973
Jeez.

98
00:07:41.057 --> 00:07:43.640
Yeah, my dad.

99
00:07:43.765 --> 00:07:48.850
Okay, stud,
you have to go now.

100
00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:54.311
Oh, um,
about the sex stuff?

101
00:07:54.436 --> 00:07:56.771
I was only half serious.
I don't wanna rush you or anything.

102
00:07:56.895 --> 00:08:00.145
Hey, would you settle
for PG-13?

103
00:08:00.229 --> 00:08:02.855
What's that?

104
00:08:04.273 --> 00:08:05.522
Oh, jeez!

105
00:08:05.648 --> 00:08:08.191
-- Good night, Bobby.

106
00:08:13.568 --> 00:08:16.735
Shorty, you are so loud.

107
00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:19.528
And make sure you take
your behind to class today.

108
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.904
- I do be going to class.
- Lunch is not a class, Shorty.

109
00:08:22.987 --> 00:08:25.280
It is when you got
the munchies.

110
00:08:25.405 --> 00:08:29.281
- See, that's why
you such a dumb-ass.
- Your mother.

111
00:08:29.407 --> 00:08:33.366
You my brother.
That's your mother too, jackass.

112
00:08:33.491 --> 00:08:36.742
Oh, yeah.
Well, then, your fathers stupid.

113
00:08:36.868 --> 00:08:39.410
So? I don't know him.

114
00:08:39.535 --> 00:08:42.369
Yeah, me neither.

115
00:08:42.494 --> 00:08:46.245
- Hey, girl, you ready?
- Yeah, in a minute.

116
00:08:47.830 --> 00:08:50.580
- We're gonna be late.
- Wait. There's Buffy.

117
00:08:50.706 --> 00:08:54.040
I don't know why
you hang out with her.

118
00:08:54.123 --> 00:08:56.457
- She is such a ho.
- Why do you say that?

119
00:08:56.582 --> 00:08:59.125
Cause I've seen her.

120
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:02.043
- My friend Sean
had a pool party this summer.
- Sean?

121
00:09:02.168 --> 00:09:04.127
You know, Puff Daddy?

122
00:09:04.252 --> 00:09:06.752
Anyway, everybody was drinking
Cristal champagne.

123
00:09:06.836 --> 00:09:08.378
And then it started to
get wild, and people

124
00:09:08.379 --> 00:09:09.920
were getting freaky in
the pool and stuff.

125
00:09:10.045 --> 00:09:14.131
I look over and there was
your girl getting buck wild
in the Jacuzzi.

126
00:09:14.255 --> 00:09:15.840
So?

127
00:09:15.923 --> 00:09:19.049
With a backup dancer.

128
00:09:19.174 --> 00:09:21.091
I mean, that's nasty.

129
00:09:21.175 --> 00:09:23.343
That's-That's lower
than the security guard.

130
00:09:23.468 --> 00:09:27.302
At least security can get you backstage.
She don't love herself.

131
00:09:27.384 --> 00:09:30.636
Bye, Daddy.
- I don't know. II think
Buffy's sweet, Brenda.

132
00:09:30.761 --> 00:09:34.097
She is as fake
as Press-onnails.

133
00:09:34.179 --> 00:09:36.513
Hey, baby girl!

134
00:09:38.139 --> 00:09:40.139
What is up,
my sister?

135
00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:42.848
- Bye, Mr. Gilmore.
- Bye!

136
00:09:42.974 --> 00:09:44.725
- Is he gone?
- Yep.

137
00:09:46.059 --> 00:09:49.894
Do you like what you see

138
00:09:50.018 --> 00:09:52.435
It's all about the money

139
00:09:52.518 --> 00:09:54.437
Hey, Cindy!

140
00:09:57.479 --> 00:10:00.564
- I love this color.
- Let me see that.

141
00:10:02.689 --> 00:10:06.315
- Oh, you guys should
not use this brand.
- Why not?

142
00:10:06.399 --> 00:10:09.360
- Because they test
their products on animals.
- So?

143
00:10:09.484 --> 00:10:14.027
Look, have you seen what they do
to those poor animals?

144
00:10:15.902 --> 00:10:19.653
Well, I am much more
of a people person.

145
00:10:19.779 --> 00:10:23.029
I'd like to feed all the hungry,
little children of the world.

146
00:10:23.113 --> 00:10:25.655
I�d much rather help my fellow man
than some animal.

147
00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:27.656
- Spare a dollar?
- Get away from me, you bum!

148
00:10:27.781 --> 00:10:30.449
Buffy! Can't you see
he's just hungry?

149
00:10:30.574 --> 00:10:33.492
Here you go, sir.
A nice sandwich.

150
00:10:34.576 --> 00:10:38.119
- See?
- I said a dollar, bitch!

151
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:40.495
Ow!

152
00:10:40.578 --> 00:10:43.703
God.
Look at this place.

153
00:10:43.829 --> 00:10:46.205
It's a circus.

154
00:10:46.288 --> 00:10:50.999
Hello. I'm Gail Hailstorm, author of
the book, You're Dead, I'm Rich.

155
00:10:51.081 --> 00:10:53.332
A small college town
is in shock...

156
00:10:53.415 --> 00:10:55.626
after the unthinkable
has happened:

157
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:58.751
a brutal killing spree
that left one teen dead--

158
00:10:58.834 --> 00:11:01.127
That's it. Two teens dead...

159
00:11:01.252 --> 00:11:03.586
and this small town
shaken and stirred.

160
00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:07.212
- Its times like these--
- Police are combing
the area for clues.

161
00:11:07.337 --> 00:11:09.546
There are no witnesses
available at this time.

162
00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:11.547
There are no suspects
in custody.

163
00:11:11.672 --> 00:11:13.547
Police are asking anyone
to come forward.

164
00:11:13.672 --> 00:11:15.256
Reporting live for Black TV.
White folks are

165
00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:16.840
- dead and we're getting
the fuck out of here!

166
00:11:16.924 --> 00:11:20.134
Grab your shit
and lets go, motherfucker!

167
00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:26.928
Hey, do you think the press is gonna
wanna talk to us?

168
00:11:27.053 --> 00:11:29.346
Oh, girl, no. The press
only wants to interview

169
00:11:29.347 --> 00:11:31.638
the most ignorant
person they can find.

170
00:11:31.763 --> 00:11:35.473
I'm on TV! Oh, shit!
First Cops, now this!

171
00:11:35.555 --> 00:11:37.473
Oh, man, I'm gonna be
a star, son!

172
00:11:37.556 --> 00:11:42.266
- What can you tell us about Drew?
- Well, she had the fat ass.

173
00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:45.350
- I mean, it was like bang!
- How close were you to the victim?

174
00:11:45.434 --> 00:11:48.019
Real close.
Until the roofies wore off.

175
00:11:48.101 --> 00:11:50.144
Then she woke up talking about
pressing charges.

176
00:11:50.228 --> 00:11:52.354
So I just pulled my tongue
out of her ass and left.

177
00:11:52.436 --> 00:11:54.604
What would have been
your last words to Drew?

178
00:11:54.729 --> 00:11:57.772
Run, bitch! Run!

179
00:12:00.856 --> 00:12:04.316
Hey, yo, dawg.
Does this shirt make me look gay?

180
00:12:04.399 --> 00:12:06.317
No, man.

181
00:12:08.067 --> 00:12:10.567
What about now?

182
00:12:10.651 --> 00:12:13.153
- Nah. Yeah.
- Cool?

183
00:12:13.235 --> 00:12:15.611
Here. Take one, guys.
elections Tuesday.

184
00:12:15.694 --> 00:12:18.195
election's Tuesday.

185
00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.531
Ah! Goddamn it!
Son of a bitch!

186
00:12:22.614 --> 00:12:25.407
What's the matter, honey?

187
00:12:25.531 --> 00:12:27.408
My report card.

188
00:12:29.991 --> 00:12:32.035
Well, at least
you got one A.

189
00:12:32.117 --> 00:12:35.452
Yeah. I did, huh?

190
00:12:35.535 --> 00:12:39.161
You're so smart.

191
00:12:39.287 --> 00:12:41.621
- Hey, has anybody seen Bobby?
- Nah.

192
00:12:41.746 --> 00:12:44.122
You know what?
That kid is always late.

193
00:12:44.204 --> 00:12:46.539
I don't get it.
He lives so close.

194
00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:59.252
See you later,
Hairy Mama, Bubba, Jim,

195
00:12:59.335 --> 00:13:02.254
Big Jim, Little Jim,
Slim Jim, everybody.

196
00:13:02.336 --> 00:13:05.045
I'll see you later. Ciao, Ding.
All right.

197
00:13:11.423 --> 00:13:14.299
Damn, girl.
Mm-mm-mm.

198
00:13:14.383 --> 00:13:16.883
- I�d sure like to get in them pants.
- Really?

199
00:13:17.007 --> 00:13:19.551
Yeah. What size are these?

200
00:13:19.676 --> 00:13:21.634
Hey, guys.

201
00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:24.553
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, baby.

202
00:13:24.678 --> 00:13:27.220
- How you doing?
- Good.

203
00:13:27.344 --> 00:13:30.054
- You guys see all
the reporters out there?
- Yeah.

204
00:13:30.138 --> 00:13:32.472
Saying that girl Drew Decker
got killed last night.

205
00:13:32.597 --> 00:13:34.848
- You know what? I think I knew her.
- Really?

206
00:13:34.932 --> 00:13:37.974
- She had a brother named Steve?
- Yeah.

207
00:13:38.099 --> 00:13:40.683
Long hair, pretty little mouth,
perfect ass?

208
00:13:40.808 --> 00:13:43.685
- That was her.
- Nah, I was talking about Steve.

209
00:13:43.810 --> 00:13:45.768
Whatever happened
to him?

210
00:13:45.851 --> 00:13:48.770
Do you guys think its strange
that she got killed...

211
00:13:48.894 --> 00:13:52.145
exactly one year
after we,

212
00:13:52.229 --> 00:13:54.563
you know,
killed that guy?

213
00:13:54.647 --> 00:13:57.022
Hey, Cindy,
that was an accident.

214
00:13:57.105 --> 00:13:59.023
Was it, Greg?

215
00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.067
Yeah!

216
00:14:16.322 --> 00:14:19.031
Would you look
at what they're doing?

217
00:14:19.156 --> 00:14:21.323
When are we gonna do
stuff like that, huh?

218
00:14:21.406 --> 00:14:23.365
One day.

219
00:14:23.448 --> 00:14:26.033
- You like that, baby?
- Yeah, that's different.

220
00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:28.408
- You like that?
- Oh, I love that.

221
00:14:28.491 --> 00:14:30.868
Oh, I love
when you play with my ass.

222
00:14:30.951 --> 00:14:32.868
I'm not playing
with your ass.

223
00:14:35.411 --> 00:14:38.996
- Ray!
- Oh, my bad.

224
00:14:39.121 --> 00:14:43.247
Come on, man!
Hey, Bobby, put on some music.

225
00:14:43.330 --> 00:14:45.331
Hold on.

226
00:14:45.456 --> 00:14:47.332
Here. Put this on.

227
00:14:49.875 --> 00:14:53.709
-It's raining men
- Yeah, that's the shit
right here!

228
00:14:53.834 --> 00:14:56.543
-Hallelujah
- Its raining men

229
00:14:56.668 --> 00:14:59.170
- Baby.
-Amen

230
00:14:59.252 --> 00:15:03.712
-I'm gonna go out
I'm gonna let myself get
- What? It's a classic.

231
00:15:03.838 --> 00:15:07.255
-Absolutely soakin wet
- Put on the radio, man.

232
00:15:09.966 --> 00:15:12.466
Yeah! Whoo!

233
00:15:25.305 --> 00:15:28.721
- What? It was laundry day.
- What the fuck is--

234
00:15:28.846 --> 00:15:30.889
Yeah!

235
00:15:31.014 --> 00:15:35.015
Whoo! Yeah!

236
00:15:38.558 --> 00:15:41.101
- Hey. Come over here.
- What?

237
00:15:41.227 --> 00:15:44.311
-Just get a little closer to me.
- Something you're gonna tell me?

238
00:15:44.435 --> 00:15:47.937
-- Bobby, what are you doing?

239
00:15:48.019 --> 00:15:50.813
I just want you to touch it.
Just touch it. Come on.

240
00:15:50.897 --> 00:15:52.856
- Uh--
-Just a little bit. Come on.

241
00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.939
Whoo!

242
00:15:57.607 --> 00:16:01.567
- Ow!
- Oh, yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

243
00:16:11.446 --> 00:16:12.946
Oh, my God! Shit!

244
00:16:15.446 --> 00:16:18.864
God, Cindy--
Oh, shit!

245
00:16:30.326 --> 00:16:32.745
- Oh, my God.
- What was that?

246
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:34.911
I think
we hit something.

247
00:16:39.247 --> 00:16:42.039
Oh, man!

248
00:16:42.123 --> 00:16:45.999
Bobby, look at my car, man!
My dads gonna freak!

249
00:16:46.124 --> 00:16:48.834
I didn't see it.
It came out of nowhere.

250
00:16:48.958 --> 00:16:51.543
- Oh, my God, we hit a boot.
- Where's the foot?

251
00:16:51.668 --> 00:16:54.043
I don't know.

252
00:16:54.168 --> 00:16:57.044
Where the--

253
00:16:57.169 --> 00:16:59.379
Its a body!

254
00:16:59.504 --> 00:17:01.462
- Oh, shit, is he alive?
- I don't know.

255
00:17:01.547 --> 00:17:03.588
- Well, check it out.
- I cant.

256
00:17:03.714 --> 00:17:06.798
- Shit!
- We have to call the police.

257
00:17:06.923 --> 00:17:09.966
- No way. I ain't going to jail.
- We have to!

258
00:17:10.091 --> 00:17:12.384
Cindy, do you know what they do
to young boys in prison?

259
00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:13.968
And all those sex-starved
convicts just

260
00:17:13.969 --> 00:17:15.468
waiting for a fresh
piece of meat.

261
00:17:15.592 --> 00:17:18.636
Hey, you're right, Cindy.
Maybe we should call the police.

262
00:17:18.761 --> 00:17:21.052
Oh, yeah, That's a great idea, Ray.
 But what about Brenda, huh?

263
00:17:21.178 --> 00:17:23.053
You think she wants
to go to jail?

264
00:17:23.179 --> 00:17:25.138
This is manslaughter, okay?
We're all gonna fry for this.

265
00:17:25.221 --> 00:17:28.973
- We're looking at 10 to 15 years.
- Shut up, Bobby!

266
00:17:29.055 --> 00:17:32.015
- Its okay. I'm fine.
-Alcohol all over.
- We're in so much trouble.

267
00:17:32.099 --> 00:17:35.057
- I'm fine.
-  -Don't blame that shit on me, Ray.

268
00:17:35.182 --> 00:17:39.184
- Look, well get rid of the body.
- Unnecessary.

269
00:17:39.269 --> 00:17:40.623
- Now you're thinking.
- We'll dump him in the ocean.

270
00:17:40.624 --> 00:17:41.977
- Not the ocean, the pier.

271
00:17:42.102 --> 00:17:44.185
- Guess I'll be leaving now.
- That's a great idea.

272
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:46.312
- What about the alcohol?
- Well get rid of it.

273
00:17:46.437 --> 00:17:48.438
Come on. It'll be all right.

274
00:17:48.521 --> 00:17:50.772
- Come on. Hurry up. Lets go.
- Put him in the trunk.

275
00:17:50.897 --> 00:17:53.439
- I wont have anything to do with this!
- Shut up!

276
00:17:53.524 --> 00:17:56.982
Cindy, come on.
Well just pretend it never happened.

277
00:17:57.065 --> 00:18:00.316
You know, like the time we got drunk
and we went down on each other.

278
00:18:00.401 --> 00:18:01.922
- I'll get his arm.
- I'll grab. I'll grab his other arm.

279
00:18:01.923 --> 00:18:03.443
- I'll grab his ass.

280
00:18:03.568 --> 00:18:06.819
Well take him down to Williamson Cove
and we'll dump him in there.

281
00:18:06.944 --> 00:18:08.862
The sharks'll take care
of the evidence.

282
00:18:08.945 --> 00:18:11.029
Oh, my God,
someone's coming.

283
00:18:11.112 --> 00:18:15.031
- Oh, shit. Its Shorty.
- Brenda, take care of him.

284
00:18:21.448 --> 00:18:24.493
Shorty, I know you ain't driving
without no papers.

285
00:18:24.575 --> 00:18:27.701
I got papers,
blunts, bongs,

286
00:18:27.826 --> 00:18:30.286
all the ingredients
to make a high niggard pie.

287
00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:35.663
- Hey, yo, can I help you?
- Yo, what's up, Ray?

288
00:18:35.746 --> 00:18:38.664
- Yo, son, you all need jumper cables?
- Nah, we're cool.

289
00:18:38.748 --> 00:18:42.498
Oh, good, cause I left
my roach clip at home.

290
00:18:42.582 --> 00:18:45.458
- Go home, Shorty.
- Yeah, I-I'll see you later.

291
00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.375
Peace, Ray.

292
00:18:47.499 --> 00:18:50.001
- Get the trunk closed.
- It won't close.

293
00:18:50.126 --> 00:18:52.752
I'll do it.

294
00:19:17.344 --> 00:19:20.387
Hold on. Hold on. Put him down.
He's heavy. Oh, God.

295
00:19:22.595 --> 00:19:26.306
Okay, look. On three we dump him
over the ledge.

296
00:19:26.432 --> 00:19:28.848
Wait, wait, wait.
Shouldn't we at least check his wallet?

297
00:19:28.973 --> 00:19:32.599
- For what?
- Shit, he might have some money.

298
00:19:32.724 --> 00:19:35.642
We already committed murder.
We might as well rob his ass.

299
00:19:35.726 --> 00:19:37.101
- I'll take the credit cards.

300
00:19:37.102 --> 00:19:38.476
- I want his jewelry.
- I'm gonna take his drawers.

301
00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:43.602
Get off!. Hey, yo, get off!.
His drawers are mine! Yo!

302
00:19:43.728 --> 00:19:47.354
- I got me a gold ring.
- Credit cards.

303
00:19:47.479 --> 00:19:50.981
- All right, lets get him in the water.
- I don't think I can, Greg.

304
00:19:51.105 --> 00:19:53.524
- Its not too late.
- Shut up, okay?

305
00:19:53.648 --> 00:19:57.775
- Christ, already. I'll do it.
-Just get him in the water.

306
00:19:57.858 --> 00:20:00.776
Okay. One, two,

307
00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:02.776
three.

308
00:20:06.945 --> 00:20:10.530
Right now we make a pact.
We take this to our grave.

309
00:20:10.655 --> 00:20:12.197
-Agreed?
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

310
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.239
- Agreed?
- Agreed.

311
00:20:14.323 --> 00:20:17.407
Say it, Cindy. Say it!

312
00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:20.408
We take this to our grave. Say it!

313
00:20:20.492 --> 00:20:23.117
We take this to our grave. Say it.

314
00:20:23.242 --> 00:20:25.118
Greg, chill. Come on.
You're hurting her.

315
00:20:25.243 --> 00:20:28.244
We take this
to our grave. Ow.

316
00:20:28.328 --> 00:20:30.995
And we never
mention this again.

317
00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:33.038
Mention what?

318
00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:37.665
- The guy we just killed.
- Well, you just mentioned it, Greg.

319
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:39.540
Starting now!

320
00:20:39.623 --> 00:20:41.874
Stupid bitch, man.

321
00:20:41.958 --> 00:20:45.750
- God. I hate him.
- Its gonna be okay, baby.
It's gonna be okay.

322
00:20:45.875 --> 00:20:50.419
I promise. Just touch it again.
Come on. Please.

323
00:20:53.502 --> 00:20:56.921
- You have to move on, Cindy.
That's all behind us now.
- Exactly.

324
00:20:57.005 --> 00:20:59.422
- Its a coincidence.
- Gregss right, Cindy.

325
00:20:59.504 --> 00:21:02.256
I mean, what do you think
we're in, a horror movie?

326
00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:06.007
Yeah, you guys are right.
If we were,

327
00:21:06.132 --> 00:21:08.487
they'd probably cast
some dingbat like

328
00:21:08.488 --> 00:21:10.842
Jennifer Love Huge
Tits to play me.

329
00:21:10.968 --> 00:21:12.864
Yeah, or they'd cast
people in their late

330
00:21:12.865 --> 00:21:14.760
twenties, early
thirties to play us.

331
00:21:17.096 --> 00:21:20.721
-- Kenny, get the camera ready.
Here. Hold my gum.

332
00:21:22.805 --> 00:21:26.098
- Sheriff, Sheriff,
can I get a statement?
- No comment.

333
00:21:26.223 --> 00:21:31.475
Damn. Who do I have to screw around here
to get a stupid story?

334
00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:33.976
Hey! Hey, no running.

335
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:37.977
Loser.

336
00:21:38.061 --> 00:21:41.061
- Slow it down!
- Blow me!

337
00:21:41.186 --> 00:21:43.438
All right!

338
00:21:43.563 --> 00:21:46.522
Hi. Gail Hailstorm.
Field Reporter, Hard Story.

339
00:21:46.605 --> 00:21:48.773
Special Officer Doofy.

340
00:21:48.897 --> 00:21:52.858
Oh, hi, Doofy. Doofy, listen.
Is there a problem on campus?

341
00:21:52.941 --> 00:21:55.149
- No comment. No comment.
- Okay. Okay.

342
00:21:55.274 --> 00:21:58.944
You know, you look awfully young
to be a police officer.

343
00:21:59.026 --> 00:22:01.527
- I'm 25 and a half years old.
- Ooh!

344
00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:03.820
- Yeah, that's this many.
- Ah, so big.

345
00:22:03.945 --> 00:22:06.112
Yeah. That's big.

346
00:22:06.195 --> 00:22:08.822
- Well, you don't look
a day over 12.

347
00:22:08.905 --> 00:22:12.615
Except for the big head
and glazed-over look in your eyes.

348
00:22:12.741 --> 00:22:16.324
- Ooh, was that drool?
- Yeah. I forgot to swallow.

349
00:22:16.407 --> 00:22:19.825
Don't worry,
cause I never forget.

350
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.369
- Would you remind me
not to do that again?
- Sorry.

351
00:22:24.452 --> 00:22:27.453
Due to the recent tragedy, the sheriff
and me, your principal,

352
00:22:27.578 --> 00:22:29.996
will be questioning all students
throughout the day.

353
00:22:30.121 --> 00:22:32.997
Wow. Sounds like we've got the makings
of a serial killer on our hands.

354
00:22:33.123 --> 00:22:35.831
Yeah, I'm not supposed to say.
It's official police business.

355
00:22:35.956 --> 00:22:39.915
Hey, Doofy, what do you say you and I
go inside my van over there...

356
00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.708
and, uh, get to know
each other a little better?

357
00:22:42.833 --> 00:22:46.585
- Would you like that?
Yeah, that van right there.
- That van?

358
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.169
Yeah.

359
00:22:49.253 --> 00:22:52.754
- Yeah, okay, lets go. Come on.
- Oh!

360
00:22:52.879 --> 00:22:56.881
A terrible tragedy
and an unbearable loss.

361
00:22:56.963 --> 00:23:01.048
Its days like today
that we need prayer in school.

362
00:23:01.132 --> 00:23:06.134
It starts to unravel
the very moral fabric
of our society.

363
00:23:06.258 --> 00:23:08.467
Here you go, baby.

364
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.468
Go to your daddy.

365
00:23:10.551 --> 00:23:12.969
Oh!

366
00:23:13.052 --> 00:23:16.179
I'll see you after class.

367
00:23:16.303 --> 00:23:18.220
- Sweet!
- All right!

368
00:23:18.304 --> 00:23:22.139
Okay, class, who would like to give
their oral presentation first?

369
00:23:22.264 --> 00:23:25.099
- Oh!
- Anybody?

370
00:23:25.224 --> 00:23:28.224
- Yes!
- Anybody else?

371
00:23:30.058 --> 00:23:33.268
Okay, Heather.

372
00:23:35.770 --> 00:23:38.228
- Okay. Can I start?
- Yeah.

373
00:23:38.353 --> 00:23:41.562
Okay, my presentation
is on the First Amendment.

374
00:23:41.687 --> 00:23:46.107
And it began on May 25, 1787 in Philly
with George Washington.

375
00:23:46.231 --> 00:23:48.106
And it states, and I quote,

376
00:23:48.232 --> 00:23:49.837
When our Founding
Fathers argued the

377
00:23:49.838 --> 00:23:51.441
passage of our glorious
Constitution--

378
00:24:41.126 --> 00:24:44.668
The First Amendment gives us the right
to say what we want--

379
00:24:44.794 --> 00:24:47.711
Oh, shut the fuck up!

380
00:24:47.836 --> 00:24:51.088
So, who's next?

381
00:24:51.213 --> 00:24:54.213
Uh, Cindy Campbell.

382
00:24:54.338 --> 00:24:57.589
Isn't she the daughter
of, well, you know--

383
00:24:57.714 --> 00:25:01.258
- Oh, yeah, you know, old Mrs., uh--
- Old Mrs. --

384
00:25:01.341 --> 00:25:04.217
Yeah. Yeah,
the one and only--

385
00:25:04.341 --> 00:25:07.718
The one and only.

386
00:25:07.843 --> 00:25:11.470
- Why, hello, Cindy.
- Hi, Principal Seuiggman.

387
00:25:11.553 --> 00:25:15.763
- Thanks, Doofy.
- Its Special Officer Doofy today,
Cindy.

388
00:25:15.887 --> 00:25:18.076
Now, Cindy, Sheriff
has some questions

389
00:25:18.077 --> 00:25:20.264
that he would like
to ask you today.

390
00:25:20.389 --> 00:25:23.891
- What is that... god-awful smell?
- I don't know.

391
00:25:23.974 --> 00:25:25.307
I got a poopie.

392
00:25:26.475 --> 00:25:29.393
Did you just say
that you went poopie?

393
00:25:29.475 --> 00:25:32.561
- Yeah. It was good.
- Mm.

394
00:25:32.643 --> 00:25:35.769
- Get him out of here.
- Yes.

395
00:25:35.894 --> 00:25:38.396
- Thank you, Doofy.
- Okay.

396
00:25:38.478 --> 00:25:40.938
You should now go back
to Special Ed.

397
00:25:41.021 --> 00:25:44.648
- Okay. Salute.
- Maybe a change of underwear, son.

398
00:25:44.731 --> 00:25:47.942
- Bye, Doofy.
- Bye, Cindy.

399
00:25:48.066 --> 00:25:50.817
- How are you, Cindy?
- Fine.

400
00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:53.818
- How are you, Sheriff?
- Bloated, constipated.

401
00:25:53.901 --> 00:25:57.485
Got a boil on my ass
the size of a walnut.
You know, the usual.

402
00:25:57.611 --> 00:26:00.486
Cindy, I want to ask you
some questions about Drew Decker.

403
00:26:02.279 --> 00:26:05.030
- I didn't really know her.
- Oh, come on. Sure you do.

404
00:26:05.155 --> 00:26:07.489
No. I mean,
I didn't really know her.

405
00:26:07.614 --> 00:26:11.282
I've been in this game a long time.
Don't bullshit a bullshitter.

406
00:26:11.365 --> 00:26:14.867
Tell me about Drew. What
was she like in bed, Cindy?

407
00:26:16.076 --> 00:26:19.202
Tried to get you.
Its an old police trick.

408
00:26:19.327 --> 00:26:22.870
Its an old police trick.
You didn't fall for it.
Good for you, kid.

409
00:26:22.954 --> 00:26:24.870
Hike!

410
00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:28.372
Pass! Pass!

411
00:26:30.539 --> 00:26:33.041
-- All right, shower up!

412
00:26:33.124 --> 00:26:35.207
Yes!

413
00:26:35.291 --> 00:26:38.835
Yo, Dugan, man,
nice play, yo. Word up.

414
00:26:38.959 --> 00:26:40.918
Johnson, what a block, baby.

415
00:26:41.001 --> 00:26:44.962
Word up. Woodward. Nice ass.

416
00:26:45.086 --> 00:26:47.212
Damn.

417
00:26:47.336 --> 00:26:50.671
Yo, Greg, what's up?
You gonna hit the showers or what?

418
00:26:50.754 --> 00:26:54.923
No, man. I think I'm gonna work out,
beat the bag a little.

419
00:26:55.048 --> 00:26:59.175
Suit yourself, kid. All right.
Last one in the showers a rotten egg!

420
00:26:59.257 --> 00:27:03.176
Come on, yall!
I'm gonna get you all!

421
00:27:03.259 --> 00:27:06.260
Don't let Uncle Ray catch you!

422
00:27:29.436 --> 00:27:33.729
Who did this? Huh?
Where are you?

423
00:27:33.854 --> 00:27:36.104
This isn't funny, all right?

424
00:27:36.188 --> 00:27:39.231
A small dicks like a disability, man!

425
00:27:39.314 --> 00:27:43.564
Would you make fun of a guy
in a wheelchair? Huh? Would you?

426
00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:46.066
Come on out here,
you sick fuck!

427
00:27:46.191 --> 00:27:50.150
I'll kick the shit
out of you right now! All right?

428
00:27:50.235 --> 00:27:52.235
Its not the size
of the hammer,

429
00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.236
its the nail
you're throwing it at!

430
00:27:56.737 --> 00:27:59.279
It's a shame how she died.

431
00:27:59.404 --> 00:28:01.655
- She was such a nice girl.

432
00:28:01.656 --> 00:28:03.905
- Yeah, she used to
baby-sit my brother Doofy.

433
00:28:03.989 --> 00:28:07.656
- He had the biggest crush on her.
- Ray, you're a dead man.

434
00:28:07.781 --> 00:28:10.200
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey.

435
00:28:10.283 --> 00:28:12.283
You wanna get
butt-naked and wrestle?

436
00:28:12.408 --> 00:28:15.660
- Bring it on, Ray!
- Hold my earrings. Where's my Vaseline?

437
00:28:15.784 --> 00:28:18.702
- Take it easy. What's the problem?
- I'll show you the problem.

438
00:28:18.786 --> 00:28:21.620
Oh-- That's you?

439
00:28:21.704 --> 00:28:25.330
They-- They turned the hot water off
in the showers, all right?

440
00:28:30.207 --> 00:28:32.790
Laugh it up, you guys.
Big laugh.

441
00:28:34.416 --> 00:28:36.917
You know what?
You can all go to hell!

442
00:28:37.001 --> 00:28:40.293
Greg, you're not the only one
who got one.

443
00:28:40.419 --> 00:28:43.753
Oh, you mean
Bobby�s got a baby dick too?

444
00:28:46.338 --> 00:28:48.963
No. I was talking
about the note.

445
00:28:49.046 --> 00:28:51.339
I got one too.

446
00:28:51.423 --> 00:28:54.215
- Somebody knows.
- That's bullshit, Cindy.

447
00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:56.341
Someone just trying
to fuck with us.

448
00:28:56.466 --> 00:28:59.092
We have to call
the police, Greg.

449
00:28:59.217 --> 00:29:01.885
You call the police,
and I'll kill you myself.

450
00:29:09.178 --> 00:29:11.554
- You're hurting her, man.
- And you know what?

451
00:29:11.639 --> 00:29:13.554
That goes for all of you guys.

452
00:29:13.639 --> 00:29:16.266
That psycho wants
a piece of me, bring it on.

453
00:29:16.348 --> 00:29:19.474
But I'm not going to jail.
You got that?

454
00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.977
What's everybody
talking about?

455
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:32.103
Just forget it, Shorty.
You already know too much.

456
00:29:34.937 --> 00:29:37.772
-- Aren't they beautiful?

457
00:29:39.231 --> 00:29:42.232
- Buffy!
- Contestant number one!

458
00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:48.817
Very good.
And contestant number two.

459
00:29:52.736 --> 00:29:55.611
Very good.
And contestant number three.

460
00:29:55.736 --> 00:29:59.280
Buffy! That's my girl!

461
00:29:59.405 --> 00:30:02.656
- That's my girlfriend!
- Yeah, that's my girlfriend too!

462
00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.032
- Hey, kiss my ass!
- Yeah, I'm hitting that too!

463
00:30:06.115 --> 00:30:09.117
- All right, Buffy!
- Hey, shut the hell up, man!

464
00:30:09.242 --> 00:30:13.118
- The best pussy I ever had!
- What, you want a piece of me?

465
00:30:13.201 --> 00:30:14.868
Now the talent portion
of the competition.

466
00:30:14.994 --> 00:30:17.224
Oh, you guys, I'm gonna
go downstairs for

467
00:30:17.225 --> 00:30:19.453
a closer seat. See
you after the show.

468
00:30:19.579 --> 00:30:22.497
Number three, Buffy Gilmore.

469
00:30:22.622 --> 00:30:23.935
Hey, you know what? I'm
gonna go hit the head.

470
00:30:23.936 --> 00:30:25.247
You want me to bring
you back anything?

471
00:30:25.372 --> 00:30:27.832
No, no, no. I'm good, man.
But hurry back. She's gonna perform.

472
00:30:27.957 --> 00:30:30.541
- Don't worry. I'll be back.
- Good evening, Buffy.

473
00:30:30.666 --> 00:30:32.793
And what will be
your talent for this evening?

474
00:30:32.918 --> 00:30:36.709
Acting. I'll be doing
a dramatic reading.

475
00:30:36.793 --> 00:30:39.045
Yeah, yeah!

476
00:30:39.127 --> 00:30:41.170
Buffy Gilmore
doing a dramatic reading.

477
00:30:43.004 --> 00:30:46.547
Hey, do that thing from Baywatch!
She's running down the beach!

478
00:30:53.466 --> 00:30:55.508
Look out, Greg!
Look behind you!

479
00:30:57.091 --> 00:30:59.843
- Its him! It's the killer!
- Huh?

480
00:30:59.967 --> 00:31:02.886
Oh, my God!
Somebody do something!

481
00:31:03.011 --> 00:31:06.511
Somebody do something!

482
00:31:06.595 --> 00:31:08.721
He's killing him!

483
00:31:08.846 --> 00:31:11.681
- He's killing him!
- Must be an original piece.

484
00:31:11.763 --> 00:31:13.682
He's killing him!

485
00:31:13.765 --> 00:31:17.391
She's good. She's good.

486
00:31:17.473 --> 00:31:20.350
- What's wrong with you people?
- That's fantastic.

487
00:31:20.474 --> 00:31:23.768
You fucking bastards!
Why won't anyone help?

488
00:31:23.851 --> 00:31:27.311
- Amazing.
- She's the next Pamela Lee.

489
00:31:27.394 --> 00:31:29.813
Oh, God!
Oh, God! Don't!

490
00:31:29.895 --> 00:31:33.439
Greg, hold on!

491
00:31:35.023 --> 00:31:37.440
Give it up for Buffy Gilmore!
Beautiful.

492
00:31:37.565 --> 00:31:39.649
Absolutely fantastic.

493
00:31:42.857 --> 00:31:46.901
I think we have a winner,
ladies and gentlemen.
Miss Buffy Gilmore!

494
00:31:46.984 --> 00:31:49.570
Buffy, wait.
You have to go back onstage.

495
00:31:49.695 --> 00:31:51.986
- No. I have to get to Greg.
- But you won!

496
00:31:52.111 --> 00:31:55.238
- They're calling your name.
- There's a killer--

497
00:31:55.321 --> 00:31:57.655
- I won?
- They're calling your name. Go.

498
00:31:57.737 --> 00:32:00.615
- Buffy, what happened? What about Greg?
- Oh, fuck Greg. I won.

499
00:32:00.698 --> 00:32:03.449
- Congratulations!
- Oh, out of my way, loser!

500
00:32:03.531 --> 00:32:06.366
- Miss Buffy Gilmore!

501
00:32:06.491 --> 00:32:08.491
Here she comes

502
00:32:08.576 --> 00:32:11.577
Miss Teen She's So Fine

503
00:32:11.702 --> 00:32:13.953
- Such lovely tits
- Give me my crown, bitch.

504
00:32:14.079 --> 00:32:17.203
And a great behind

505
00:32:17.287 --> 00:32:22.288
There she is
Doggy style anytime

506
00:32:22.413 --> 00:32:26.623
And I'll do her behind
behind and behind

507
00:32:26.748 --> 00:32:29.667
Oh, there she is

508
00:32:29.749 --> 00:32:32.292
She loves 69

509
00:32:32.375 --> 00:32:34.627
There's no sign
of him anywhere.

510
00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:38.502
- He could've taken the body.
- That's impossible, Cindy.

511
00:32:38.586 --> 00:32:39.879
- There's no blood. There's nothing.
Look around.

512
00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:41.171
- I'll bet it's just
Greg playing...

513
00:32:41.253 --> 00:32:43.171
another one of his dumb jokes.

514
00:32:43.296 --> 00:32:44.797
He's gonna turn up. I'm sure of it.
He's

515
00:32:44.798 --> 00:32:46.298
- probably at my house
waiting for us right now,

516
00:32:46.423 --> 00:32:48.965
-you guys.
- All right, fine.

517
00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.674
But you know what?
I'm gonna look around some more, so--

518
00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:53.967
- You mind catching
a ride home with Buffy?
- Yeah, no problem.

519
00:32:54.092 --> 00:32:56.509
- All right, fine.
- Call me later.

520
00:33:18.058 --> 00:33:20.517
- Hello.
- Hello, Cindy.

521
00:33:20.602 --> 00:33:23.893
- Who is this?
- Its me, Bobby.

522
00:33:23.978 --> 00:33:26.478
You know, your boyfriend.

523
00:33:26.562 --> 00:33:30.606
Yeah, I'm sorry. I guess
I'm a little jumpy lately.

524
00:33:30.688 --> 00:33:33.439
- Hey, any sign of Greg?
- No.

525
00:33:33.564 --> 00:33:36.982
- Do you want me to come by?
- No.

526
00:33:37.107 --> 00:33:40.859
I'm just gonna take a bath,
and then I'm gonna go to bed.

527
00:33:40.984 --> 00:33:44.734
Okay. I�d really like
to see you, but-- I love you.

528
00:33:44.818 --> 00:33:48.237
Aw. I love you too, baby.

529
00:34:10.744 --> 00:34:12.620
Bobby, I told you--

530
00:34:12.745 --> 00:34:14.995
I still know
what you did last Halloween.

531
00:34:15.078 --> 00:34:16.787
Who is this?

532
00:34:29.791 --> 00:34:33.502
- Ow! Ow!

533
00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:39.004
- Hello.
- I'm gonna kill you.

534
00:34:39.130 --> 00:34:41.587
- I'm gonna slice you up.
- Who is this?

535
00:34:41.671 --> 00:34:43.964
- I'm gonna chop you like liver.
- What do you want?

536
00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:46.506
I'm in the house.

537
00:34:46.590 --> 00:34:51.466
Do you know where I am?

538
00:34:51.591 --> 00:34:55.343
I could be anywhere.
I'm like the wind, baby.

539
00:34:55.468 --> 00:34:58.844
Yeah. Where am I?

540
00:35:01.178 --> 00:35:03.929
Um, you're-you're
behind the couch.

541
00:35:04.013 --> 00:35:07.640
What? How do you know that?

542
00:35:07.765 --> 00:35:09.681
I can, um, see your feet.

543
00:35:11.556 --> 00:35:15.017
Ah! Okay, turn around.

544
00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:17.350
Close your eyes.
No peeking.

545
00:35:21.685 --> 00:35:26.021
Yeah. No. No. No.

546
00:35:26.104 --> 00:35:29.022
Hey, no peeking.
No peeking. Turn around.

547
00:35:29.147 --> 00:35:30.773
Good.

548
00:35:30.855 --> 00:35:32.939
Okay, now you look.

549
00:35:33.024 --> 00:35:35.857
Now do you know
where I am? You don't.

550
00:35:35.983 --> 00:35:40.026
No, Mr. Killer.
I don't know where you are.

551
00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:43.735
I'll give you a big clue.

552
00:35:46.028 --> 00:35:48.320
Oh! I gotta stop drinking.

553
00:35:54.698 --> 00:35:56.657
- Grandma!
- Ow, baby!

554
00:35:56.782 --> 00:35:58.658
Oh, my hip!

555
00:36:30.210 --> 00:36:32.627
White woman in trouble off the 744--

556
00:36:39.213 --> 00:36:42.631
Are you okay? I heard screaming.
What's going on?

557
00:36:42.713 --> 00:36:45.049
- Bobby, he was here.
- Shh.

558
00:36:45.174 --> 00:36:48.591
- The killer was here, Bobby.
- Its okay.

559
00:36:55.553 --> 00:36:59.345
- I can explain that.
- Oh, my God.

560
00:36:59.469 --> 00:37:02.304
A friend gave 'em to me.
Cindy. Cindy.

561
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:04.681
Cindy. Cindy!

562
00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:07.765
Cindy! Cindy! Cindy!

563
00:37:12.641 --> 00:37:14.642
Its me, Cindy.

564
00:37:14.767 --> 00:37:17.393
Cindy, you know me. Cindy.

565
00:37:24.063 --> 00:37:26.439
I know you've had a rough night, Cindy,
so I won't keep you.

566
00:37:26.563 --> 00:37:29.355
I just want you to look at some photos.
Tell me what you think.

567
00:37:35.568 --> 00:37:37.483
Mm-mmm.

568
00:37:39.567 --> 00:37:42.527
- No?
- No.

569
00:37:42.652 --> 00:37:46.654
- I'm sorry, Sheriff.
- You sure?

570
00:37:46.778 --> 00:37:49.696
Okay, you're free to go.
Do you have somebody picking you up?

571
00:37:49.822 --> 00:37:52.738
- Yeah.
- Oh. Just--

572
00:37:52.823 --> 00:37:55.448
Just check
that one out again.

573
00:37:56.991 --> 00:38:01.910
- Mm, no.
- No? No? Well, worth a shot.
All right, thanks.

574
00:38:01.992 --> 00:38:03.305
- Guess what I just did with
those hookers we busted.

575
00:38:03.306 --> 00:38:04.618
- No way.

576
00:38:04.701 --> 00:38:07.786
All the way, man! Yes, yes.
Watch this. Doofy!

577
00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:10.162
- Yeah?
- Come on. Come on.

578
00:38:10.287 --> 00:38:11.788
Okay.

579
00:38:11.871 --> 00:38:14.789
Special Officer Doofy
reporting.

580
00:38:14.871 --> 00:38:17.373
Hey, Doofy,
smell my fingers.

581
00:38:17.456 --> 00:38:22.208
- What's that?
- That's when you know
you've become a man, Doofy!

582
00:38:22.292 --> 00:38:25.250
Hey, Terry,
smell my finger.

583
00:38:25.375 --> 00:38:28.043
- What the hell is that?
- My ass.

584
00:38:28.127 --> 00:38:30.211
- Get the hell
out of here, Doofy.
- Doofy.

585
00:38:30.293 --> 00:38:35.129
- Mom said get home now.
- Tell Mom I'm on official
police business.

586
00:38:35.253 --> 00:38:38.964
- Cindy, are you okay?
- Hey, hey, hey.
No talking to the witness.

587
00:38:39.089 --> 00:38:41.882
- Go get in the car, Doofy.
She's coming with us.
- Does Mom know?

588
00:38:42.007 --> 00:38:44.966
- Yeah, Doofus.
- Mom says when I wear this badge,

589
00:38:45.091 --> 00:38:47.467
you're supposed to treat me
like a man of the law.

590
00:38:47.551 --> 00:38:50.551
Mom also said for you
to stop sticking your dick
in the vacuum cleaner.

591
00:38:50.675 --> 00:38:53.386
Oh!
Oh!

592
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:56.052
Okay, three, two--

593
00:38:56.178 --> 00:38:58.429
- Oh, no. Gosh darn.
- What now?

594
00:38:58.512 --> 00:38:59.617
- It's just that there's all
these numbers with deci--

595
00:38:59.618 --> 00:39:00.722
- What, can't you count?

596
00:39:00.804 --> 00:39:04.139
- No, I can count,
but there's really--
- Let me make it easy for you.

597
00:39:04.264 --> 00:39:07.766
This little piggy went to the market.
This little piggy stayed home.

598
00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:09.558
Now, if this little piggy doesn't roll
the goddamn camera--

599
00:39:09.682 --> 00:39:12.351
- I'm gonna put my foot
up his fuckin' ass--
- We're live, Gail.

600
00:39:12.476 --> 00:39:14.767
Gail Hailstorm standing out front
of the police station...

601
00:39:14.852 --> 00:39:17.143
where I'm going to try and get a glimpse
of Cindy Campbell,

602
00:39:17.228 --> 00:39:19.729
the young girl who was attacked
earlier this evening.

603
00:39:19.853 --> 00:39:22.187
- You're on my foot, fat shit!
- Sorry, G--

604
00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.231
- What did I say?
- Don't ever step
on Gail's shoes.

605
00:39:24.355 --> 00:39:26.231
- Why not?
- Because Gail wears Prada shoes.

606
00:39:26.356 --> 00:39:28.357
- You idiot.
- I'm a bad man.

607
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:30.524
Cindy! Cindy!

608
00:39:30.607 --> 00:39:32.858
- Cindy, can we get a statement?
- Buffy Gilmore, Miss Teen.

609
00:39:32.942 --> 00:39:35.859
- She's not talking.
- Is it true the police
have someone in custody?

610
00:39:35.942 --> 00:39:39.151
- Come on, Cindy.
- Cindy, your ass looks fat!

611
00:39:40.277 --> 00:39:42.069
Bitch!

612
00:39:43.487 --> 00:39:46.320
- Good shot.
- Come on.

613
00:39:46.404 --> 00:39:48.780
- All right, who copped a feel?
- Gail, it was me.

614
00:39:48.864 --> 00:39:51.530
- Oh, my God.
- It was an accident, Gail.

615
00:39:51.656 --> 00:39:54.991
I only touched it,
the top of the breast.

616
00:39:55.074 --> 00:39:56.992
- It was so tender and juicy.
- Shut up!

617
00:40:05.952 --> 00:40:09.622
- Yo.
- Hello, Shorty. What are you doing?

618
00:40:09.704 --> 00:40:14.957
Nothin'. Sittin' here watchin' the game.
Smokin' some bud.

619
00:40:16.457 --> 00:40:18.458
Are you all alone?

620
00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.834
- Was sup?
- Was sup?

621
00:40:21.916 --> 00:40:24.752
What the--
Who's that?

622
00:40:24.877 --> 00:40:27.711
Yo, pick up the phone.

623
00:40:27.793 --> 00:40:30.837
- Was sup?
- Was sup?

624
00:40:33.129 --> 00:40:35.506
Yo, Dookie,
pick up the phone!

625
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:38.965
- Yo.
- Was sup?

626
00:40:48.051 --> 00:40:53.469
- What you doin', son?
- Nothin'... Just chillin'... killin'...

627
00:40:53.552 --> 00:40:56.179
True. True.

628
00:40:56.513 --> 00:40:58.388
So you think
Bobby did it?

629
00:41:01.848 --> 00:41:04.891
I don't know.
But he was there, Buffy.

630
00:41:05.016 --> 00:41:09.058
I knew there had to be something.
He just too perfect.

631
00:41:09.142 --> 00:41:12.476
Handsome, smart,
good in bed.

632
00:41:12.602 --> 00:41:16.603
- What did you say?
- Uh--

633
00:41:16.728 --> 00:41:20.063
Hey, Cindy.
Got your ice pack for your hand.

634
00:41:20.187 --> 00:41:22.896
- Ow!
- Sorry.

635
00:41:23.022 --> 00:41:25.564
I'll get you one for your head.

636
00:41:25.689 --> 00:41:28.024
No, no, that's okay, Doofy.

637
00:41:28.149 --> 00:41:32.608
Hey, we are gonna get that guy
you dumped in the water. Yeah.

638
00:41:32.733 --> 00:41:34.734
I'll be next door
if you need me.

639
00:41:34.858 --> 00:41:38.235
Night, Cindy.

640
00:41:38.319 --> 00:41:39.777
Buffy, you told him?

641
00:41:39.861 --> 00:41:42.945
The moron overheard a conversation
Greg and I were having.

642
00:41:43.029 --> 00:41:45.446
- Yeah, but what
if he says something?
- Who's gonna believe...

643
00:41:45.531 --> 00:41:48.239
a retarded retard
like him anyway?

644
00:41:48.322 --> 00:41:50.783
Cindy, telephone.

645
00:41:52.991 --> 00:41:54.866
Thank you.

646
00:41:54.991 --> 00:41:58.325
- Hello.
- Hello, Cindy.

647
00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.786
- Guess what.
- No!

648
00:42:00.911 --> 00:42:02.952
- You got the wrong guy.
- No!

649
00:42:03.077 --> 00:42:04.953
- Doofy!
- Its not Bobby.

650
00:42:05.077 --> 00:42:06.954
Who is this?

651
00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:09.747
- Doofy! Doofy!
- Oh, my God.

652
00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.418
Hello?

653
00:42:21.501 --> 00:42:26.170
I said don't disturb me
while I'm cleaning my room!

654
00:42:32.046 --> 00:42:34.547
I heard Bobby got out
this morning.

655
00:42:34.672 --> 00:42:37.924
I haven't seen him around.
Is he pissed?

656
00:42:38.049 --> 00:42:42.092
You mean since
you branded him the Candy man?
No. His heart is broken.

657
00:42:42.216 --> 00:42:45.259
Yo, son. Its like
I seen this all before.

658
00:42:45.342 --> 00:42:47.344
They had a killer at
your old high school, Shorty?

659
00:42:47.469 --> 00:42:49.344
No, it was in this movie Scream.

660
00:42:49.469 --> 00:42:51.887
Same dialogue and everything.
This is ill.

661
00:42:52.012 --> 00:42:53.887
- How did it end?
- I don't know.

662
00:42:54.012 --> 00:42:55.576
Some niggas started
shooting up in the

663
00:42:55.577 --> 00:42:57.139
movie theater, so
we just broke out.

664
00:42:57.222 --> 00:43:00.932
- No doubt.
- Okay, I say we all
just stick together.

665
00:43:01.056 --> 00:43:03.058
Tonight everyone
meet at my house.

666
00:43:03.183 --> 00:43:04.975
And bring some friends.
But don't tell everyone.

667
00:43:04.976 --> 00:43:06.767
Try to keep it quiet.

668
00:43:06.892 --> 00:43:08.268
Okay.

669
00:43:08.392 --> 00:43:13.395
Yo! Party at Cindy's house!
Drunk white women for everybody!

670
00:43:14.977 --> 00:43:19.771
Ray, if you see Bobby,
tell him I love him.

671
00:43:19.855 --> 00:43:24.065
Okay. If I see Bobby,
I'll tell him I love him.

672
00:43:31.067 --> 00:43:33.610
-Jesus!
- Its okay. It's all right.
It's just me, baby.

673
00:43:33.735 --> 00:43:36.735
- What, you don't still
think It's me, do you?
- No.

674
00:43:36.861 --> 00:43:38.945
It's just that somebody
did try to kill me.

675
00:43:39.070 --> 00:43:41.238
- And the police said
I scared him away.

676
00:43:41.239 --> 00:43:43.405
- I know. He called
me last night.

677
00:43:43.488 --> 00:43:46.906
You see, it couldn't have been me.
I was in jail last night. Remember?

678
00:43:49.157 --> 00:43:51.116
You're the best.

679
00:43:51.199 --> 00:43:53.659
I'm sorry.
Please understand.

680
00:43:53.741 --> 00:43:55.159
Understand what? That
my girlfriend would

681
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:56.576
rather call me a
killer than touch me?

682
00:43:56.701 --> 00:43:58.578
- That's not true, Bobby.
- Then what is it?

683
00:43:58.702 --> 00:44:01.119
What is it?
She's gone and she's not coming back.

684
00:44:01.245 --> 00:44:03.433
- Its been over a year, Cindy.

685
00:44:03.434 --> 00:44:05.621
- But Ginger was such an important
part of the Spice Girls.

686
00:44:05.746 --> 00:44:08.956
- Oh, you gotta move on, baby.
- Oh!

687
00:44:09.081 --> 00:44:11.790
I'm sorry if my complicated life...

688
00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:15.959
is an inconvenience
to your perfect existence.

689
00:44:16.084 --> 00:44:18.918
Cindy. Cindy.

690
00:44:19.001 --> 00:44:21.085
Okay, everybody, listen up.

691
00:44:21.169 --> 00:44:23.502
Let me just say, uh,

692
00:44:23.587 --> 00:44:27.795
the killing of these teenagers
has been tragic, but, uh--

693
00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:29.839
Hey, you know, shit happens.

694
00:44:29.921 --> 00:44:33.465
Sheriff!. Sheriff!.

695
00:44:33.548 --> 00:44:36.757
- Yes, Miss Thunderstorm.
- Have they found
Cindy Campbell's father?

696
00:44:36.882 --> 00:44:38.925
- No.
- Isn't he a suspect?

697
00:44:39.050 --> 00:44:41.175
That is classified information.
Where are you getting that?

698
00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:45.010
I'm sorry, but my sources
are strictly confidential, Sheriff.

699
00:44:45.093 --> 00:44:47.594
Hey, Gail.

700
00:44:47.719 --> 00:44:51.012
Gail swallows.

701
00:44:56.514 --> 00:44:58.389
Watch this.

702
00:44:59.765 --> 00:45:02.683
Hello. Who is this?

703
00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:04.892
What?

704
00:45:05.018 --> 00:45:07.560
You wanna kill me?

705
00:45:07.684 --> 00:45:09.853
Oh, God. Hold on.

706
00:45:09.935 --> 00:45:13.978
Cindy, its for you.

707
00:45:15.938 --> 00:45:17.896
All right,
knock it off, Buffy.

708
00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:21.439
Now, as you all have heard,
there is a killer in town...

709
00:45:21.523 --> 00:45:24.858
and the police have asked us to give you
the following safety tips.

710
00:45:24.983 --> 00:45:27.149
Stay in well-lit areas.

711
00:45:27.274 --> 00:45:29.651
Do not travel alone
whenever possible.

712
00:45:29.776 --> 00:45:31.693
Always wipe front to back.

713
00:45:31.776 --> 00:45:34.318
And remember, never, ever
believe someone...

714
00:45:34.443 --> 00:45:37.695
when they tell you
that shaving your pubic hair...

715
00:45:37.778 --> 00:45:40.738
will rid you
of crab infestation.

716
00:45:40.822 --> 00:45:44.781
Now, I understand
this is a difficult time
for you young ladies.

717
00:45:44.866 --> 00:45:47.866
So if anyone needs
to come to my office to talk,

718
00:45:47.991 --> 00:45:49.992
I am here for you.

719
00:45:54.118 --> 00:45:57.411
- What a crock of shit.
- It's not, Buffy!

720
00:45:57.494 --> 00:46:00.412
He's real!

721
00:46:09.498 --> 00:46:11.375
Miss Mann?

722
00:46:13.458 --> 00:46:16.752
Come in, dear. Have a seat.
Take off your bra if you'd like.

723
00:46:18.334 --> 00:46:21.253
No, thanks.

724
00:46:21.336 --> 00:46:23.462
What can I do for you,
Cindy?

725
00:46:23.587 --> 00:46:27.755
I need to talk.
See, I have this problem...

726
00:46:27.838 --> 00:46:30.130
and I don't know
who to tell.

727
00:46:30.255 --> 00:46:34.257
- Not feeling so fresh?
- Huh?

728
00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:36.759
Feminine odor and itching
got you down?

729
00:46:36.841 --> 00:46:39.967
Uh, no. No, not that.

730
00:46:40.092 --> 00:46:43.386
Then what is it?

731
00:46:43.468 --> 00:46:46.638
I have a terrible secret.

732
00:46:46.762 --> 00:46:49.679
Well, Cindy, we all have
our little secrets.

733
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:55.097
Sometimes we do things
we're not so proud of.

734
00:46:55.223 --> 00:46:57.848
Some for money,

735
00:46:57.974 --> 00:47:01.433
others to gain the athletic edge
on the competition.

736
00:47:01.518 --> 00:47:04.101
Sometimes those secrets
come back to haunt us.

737
00:47:04.184 --> 00:47:06.226
- Aah!
- Do you know what I mean?

738
00:47:06.352 --> 00:47:11.019
Yes, I do, um, Miss Mann.
Thanks for ball--

739
00:47:11.103 --> 00:47:15.021
I mean, all your help.
I have to go to class.

740
00:47:15.105 --> 00:47:17.023
Anytime, dear.

741
00:47:19.857 --> 00:47:23.608
- Buffy, are you coming?
- I'll catch up with you guys in a sec.

742
00:47:29.735 --> 00:47:32.653
Redrum.

743
00:47:32.737 --> 00:47:34.653
Hello?

744
00:47:41.822 --> 00:47:44.907
Somebody there?

745
00:47:45.033 --> 00:47:46.907
Hello!

746
00:47:49.951 --> 00:47:54.118
Very funny.

747
00:47:54.244 --> 00:47:56.244
Who put you up
to this, Cindy?

748
00:47:56.369 --> 00:47:58.954
Lose the cape.
Its way too '90s horror.

749
00:48:01.329 --> 00:48:05.455
Oh, so what movie is this from,
Die, Cheerleader, Die?

750
00:48:07.666 --> 00:48:12.499
Wanna play psycho killer?
Can I be the helpless cheerleader?

751
00:48:14.251 --> 00:48:16.876
Oh, so this is where
I'm supposed to beg for my life?

752
00:48:18.044 --> 00:48:21.003
Please, Mr. Killer,
don't kill me.

753
00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:27.755
So is this where
I'm supposed to bleed?

754
00:48:27.839 --> 00:48:31.632
Oh, look,
I'm bleeding!

755
00:48:33.258 --> 00:48:35.176
Oh, yeah,
I'm supposed to run, right?

756
00:48:35.301 --> 00:48:40.927
Okay. I'm running!
I'm running! Help!

757
00:48:41.052 --> 00:48:46.012
Help! Now I'm gonna fall
and break my leg, leaving me helpless.

758
00:48:46.095 --> 00:48:49.514
Aah!

759
00:48:49.596 --> 00:48:53.390
There you go, Mr. Scary Killer.
I'm panicking now.

760
00:48:53.473 --> 00:48:57.723
Oh, God!
Somebody please help me!

761
00:48:57.808 --> 00:49:00.017
Oh, God, no!

762
00:49:00.143 --> 00:49:02.435
No!

763
00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:05.019
Oh, now what?

764
00:49:05.144 --> 00:49:10.729
I guess this is the big climax.
Hope you don't mind if I fake it. Aah!

765
00:49:13.146 --> 00:49:16.398
Oh, look at me.
I'm all dead.

766
00:49:16.481 --> 00:49:19.732
I'm a gross, scary severed head.
Come on. Please.

767
00:49:19.857 --> 00:49:23.858
Do you know who I am? I'm Miss Teen.
You're really giving me a headache.

768
00:49:23.943 --> 00:49:25.881
And you got blood all
over my Gucci sweater.

769
00:49:25.882 --> 00:49:27.818
I hope you're gonna
pay for that.

770
00:49:27.943 --> 00:49:30.403
Ah! I will not be ignored
by the likes--

771
00:49:32.029 --> 00:49:35.613
- I'm gonna jump!
- Phil, get back in there.

772
00:49:35.697 --> 00:49:37.655
- No!
- What are you doing up there?

773
00:49:37.738 --> 00:49:41.573
- Be reasonable.
- I cant take this fucking job...

774
00:49:41.657 --> 00:49:44.658
or those greasy
shit head teenagers anymore!

775
00:49:44.783 --> 00:49:50.077
- I'm going to end it all!
- Wait! Hold on!
We're getting help for you!

776
00:49:50.202 --> 00:49:52.578
Now we know Bobby�s not the killer.
So who is?

777
00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:54.579
I don't know.

778
00:49:54.662 --> 00:49:55.891
Well if the killer was
in your house last

779
00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:57.120
night, why didn't he
just kill you then?

780
00:49:57.204 --> 00:49:59.163
Because he's just
messing with us.

781
00:49:59.288 --> 00:50:01.622
don't you see?
He's got us right where he wants us.

782
00:50:01.706 --> 00:50:04.332
We cant go to the police.
He's just out

783
00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:06.958
there watching us
and waiting for us.

784
00:50:07.041 --> 00:50:10.417
What are you
waiting for, huh?

785
00:50:10.501 --> 00:50:13.167
What are you waiting for?

786
00:50:13.292 --> 00:50:15.169
What are you
waiting for?

787
00:50:15.294 --> 00:50:17.878
What am I waiting for?

788
00:50:18.003 --> 00:50:21.421
What am I waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

789
00:50:21.504 --> 00:50:24.338
Fuck you!

790
00:50:25.340 --> 00:50:27.423
Oh, my God.

791
00:50:27.548 --> 00:50:30.425
Ray, I still don't think
this party is a good idea.

792
00:50:30.550 --> 00:50:32.404
- You know I'm not gonna
let nothin' happen to you.

793
00:50:32.405 --> 00:50:34.258
- I just don't feel right.

794
00:50:34.383 --> 00:50:37.843
- Why cant we just
do something else?
- How about we go to the movies?

795
00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:41.678
Huh? You like that?
See a little movie, huh?

796
00:50:44.679 --> 00:50:48.514
- Hey! This is my song!
- Hey!

797
00:50:48.638 --> 00:50:51.682
- You know they gave me
a shout-out on the album, right?
- What?

798
00:50:51.764 --> 00:50:56.058
Everywhere I go
I see the same hos

799
00:50:56.142 --> 00:50:58.058
Ooh, Brenda.

800
00:50:58.142 --> 00:51:00.893
Did I tell you how sexy you look
in my jersey?

801
00:51:00.977 --> 00:51:03.561
- I do, Ray?
- Yes.

802
00:51:03.644 --> 00:51:06.771
I like it. Hey, get up.
Go over there. Let me see it.

803
00:51:11.647 --> 00:51:15.064
Ooh! Yes, I like that.

804
00:51:15.190 --> 00:51:17.816
- You like that? You like that?
- Yeah. Hey!

805
00:51:17.899 --> 00:51:21.859
Hey, put this on with it.

806
00:51:21.943 --> 00:51:25.235
- Ray, you are so freaky.
- That's right. You know
I'm freaky, girl.

807
00:51:25.360 --> 00:51:27.570
Go on. Pull it.
Pull it up.

808
00:51:27.652 --> 00:51:30.362
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ah, ahh!

809
00:51:30.445 --> 00:51:33.988
Yeah. Here. Put this on with it.

810
00:51:34.113 --> 00:51:35.989
Go on.

811
00:51:37.448 --> 00:51:41.700
- Are you sure?
- Go on, girl. Go on. Pull it on.

812
00:51:41.825 --> 00:51:45.117
- Okay.
- Go on.

813
00:51:46.951 --> 00:51:50.994
- I like that look.
- Ooh! I'm bad.

814
00:51:51.119 --> 00:51:54.246
Here. Put this on with it.

815
00:51:54.371 --> 00:51:56.704
Go on, girl. Put it on.

816
00:51:56.787 --> 00:51:59.748
Yeah. Put that shit on there.
Come on. Just shove it on.

817
00:51:59.872 --> 00:52:03.749
Do it. Yeah.
Ooh, so fucking sexy.

818
00:52:03.874 --> 00:52:06.457
Come here, girl.
Bring your little sexy ass
over here. Come on!

819
00:52:06.541 --> 00:52:10.792
Full speed. Charge!

820
00:52:11.918 --> 00:52:14.378
Yes! Yes!
Come on! Turn around!

821
00:52:14.503 --> 00:52:16.379
Turn around! Come on!

822
00:52:16.504 --> 00:52:18.837
Yes, Brendan!
Take it, Brendan! Take it, Brendan!

823
00:52:18.921 --> 00:52:20.963
- Who?
- Uh-- Uh, Brenda.

824
00:52:21.046 --> 00:52:24.465
Put the helmet on.
No, lets role-play.
Come on. You get me.

825
00:52:24.547 --> 00:52:26.840
- Come on! Come on!
- Huh?

826
00:52:26.923 --> 00:52:28.925
I'm here at Lovers Lookout.

827
00:52:29.008 --> 00:52:31.384
Its dark,
It's in the middle of nowhere,

828
00:52:31.467 --> 00:52:34.551
and its where hormone-driven teens
love to come and fool around.

829
00:52:34.635 --> 00:52:37.928
So very likely we're about
to see someone get killed.

830
00:52:38.011 --> 00:52:39.991
Okay, sure enough,
there's a girl in

831
00:52:39.992 --> 00:52:41.971
that car, blouse
unbuttoned, all alone.

832
00:52:42.096 --> 00:52:44.471
Lets see if she'll have
a word with us.

833
00:52:44.596 --> 00:52:48.099
Hi. Gail Hailstorm,
author of the new book
You're Next.

834
00:52:48.223 --> 00:52:51.599
- Oh, yeah.
- Can you tell us your name?

835
00:52:51.724 --> 00:52:53.600
- Well, my names Heather.

836
00:52:53.601 --> 00:52:55.475
- Can you tell us what you are
doing out here all alone?

837
00:52:55.558 --> 00:52:59.935
Well, yeah, sure.
My boyfriend and I were
just, like, making out...

838
00:53:00.061 --> 00:53:02.435
and then we heard a noise out there,
so he went to go check it,

839
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.937
but-- well, that was,
like, ten minutes ago.

840
00:53:05.062 --> 00:53:07.271
Yeah, yeah. Has it
crossed your little mind

841
00:53:07.272 --> 00:53:09.480
that your boyfriend was
probably murdered...

842
00:53:09.605 --> 00:53:12.731
and you're about
to be slaughtered next?

843
00:53:12.814 --> 00:53:16.649
- Really? No way!
- Way.

844
00:53:16.733 --> 00:53:19.109
- Heather, good luck.
- Okay, thanks, Gail. You're the best.

845
00:53:19.192 --> 00:53:22.942
Just as I thought. The murder
is happening as we speak.

846
00:53:23.027 --> 00:53:25.694
I'm going to try and break into
the bloodshed. Are you getting this?

847
00:53:25.819 --> 00:53:29.654
Excuse me. Heather, can you tell us
what you're feeling, honey?

848
00:53:29.738 --> 00:53:33.614
Lots of pain. Gail, please help me.
Gail, please!

849
00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:35.344
I'd like to help you
out, kid, but it sweeps.

850
00:53:35.345 --> 00:53:36.948
Sir, sir, can I get
a word with you?

851
00:53:37.032 --> 00:53:40.408
You got a lot of nerve coming here.
I'm just trying to do my job.

852
00:53:40.492 --> 00:53:41.930
- Get the camera off me now!
You're dead, bitch!

853
00:53:41.931 --> 00:53:43.367
- No, Kenny, keep rolling!

854
00:53:43.492 --> 00:53:45.222
I'm gonna slice your head off
and shove it up his ass.

855
00:53:45.223 --> 00:53:46.952
Get that camera off me!

856
00:53:47.035 --> 00:53:52.163
Oh, my God, Kenny!
Kenny, move your fat ass!

857
00:53:52.287 --> 00:53:55.039
Kenny! Oh, my God,
he's right behind you!

858
00:53:55.164 --> 00:53:57.705
This man is chasin' Miss Gail.

859
00:54:04.166 --> 00:54:06.126
I'm so scared right now.

860
00:54:07.918 --> 00:54:10.585
I just want to say...

861
00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:13.878
to the family of my cameraman, Kenny,

862
00:54:14.003 --> 00:54:16.337
I am so sorry.

863
00:54:16.462 --> 00:54:19.422
This was my interview,

864
00:54:19.504 --> 00:54:22.506
my story.

865
00:54:22.631 --> 00:54:24.840
Its all my fault.

866
00:54:29.717 --> 00:54:34.677
- You want some popcorn?
- Uh-uh. I brought me
a little snack of my own.

867
00:54:37.512 --> 00:54:39.845
- You want some chicken?
- Nah.

868
00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:45.952
Mm-hmm. For all yall
talkers up in here,

869
00:54:45.953 --> 00:54:48.473

870
00:54:48.557 --> 00:54:50.308
Shh.

00:54:50.392 --> 00:54:52.725
Shh, back at you. Shh!

872
00:54:55.518 --> 00:54:58.602
Why they actin' already?
It ain't nothin' but the previews.

873
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:05.312
The largest ship
the world had ever known.

874
00:55:05.438 --> 00:55:10.230
It's 400 passengers and crew on
a maiden voyage to a brave new world.

875
00:55:10.315 --> 00:55:13.275
A journey that would change
their lives forever.

876
00:55:13.399 --> 00:55:16.276
Whoo!

877
00:55:18.234 --> 00:55:22.320
I'm the king of the world!
Whoo-hoo!

878
00:55:25.070 --> 00:55:29.071
Get your ass
back down there, boy!

879
00:55:29.197 --> 00:55:32.406
- I'm gonna go to
the bathroom real quick.
- The movie about to come on.

880
00:55:32.531 --> 00:55:34.906
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Here. Take your hot sauce.

881
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:38.033
Hurry up, man.
Don't be long.

882
00:55:38.158 --> 00:55:40.575
Back up!
Let him through!

883
00:55:41.951 --> 00:55:44.743
You can move back some.
You don't own the theater.

884
00:55:51.037 --> 00:55:53.081
--And they're off!.

885
00:55:53.163 --> 00:55:55.539
It's number three in the lead.
Number two close behind.

886
00:55:55.622 --> 00:55:59.790
And number three
is the winner!

887
00:56:01.709 --> 00:56:05.085
Number two has placed,
and number four to show.

888
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:08.127
Next weeks Triple Crown
starts at 2:30.

889
00:56:08.252 --> 00:56:10.669
-- Be here early.

890
00:56:36.553 --> 00:56:38.930
Hey, who was that?

891
00:56:39.055 --> 00:56:42.263
Go ahead.
Do it again. Do it again.

892
00:56:54.268 --> 00:56:56.768
Anon.

893
00:56:58.769 --> 00:57:00.979
Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm.

894
00:57:01.062 --> 00:57:03.481
Mm-mmm!
Don't go in there!

895
00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:12.274
Lord, I'm gonna have a heart attack!

896
00:57:12.358 --> 00:57:14.442
Man, this is
some scary shit!

897
00:57:14.567 --> 00:57:17.442
Oh, I am scared!

898
00:57:17.568 --> 00:57:23.070
- Excuse me.
- I think I paid my money like
everybody else up in here.

899
00:57:23.153 --> 00:57:26.322
- ... out of her favor--
- That ain't no man.

900
00:57:26.404 --> 00:57:29.073
- You can see her real hair right there!
- Do you mind?

901
00:57:29.198 --> 00:57:32.490
I know you better
get outta my face!

902
00:57:32.573 --> 00:57:35.367
Outta my face!
Outta my face!

903
00:57:35.492 --> 00:57:38.033
This is all me up in here.
You handle that.

904
00:57:38.117 --> 00:57:40.577
- Will you shut the fuck up!
- Yeah!

905
00:57:40.702 --> 00:57:43.911
Mmm, mmm.
This movie is good.

906
00:57:43.995 --> 00:57:48.578
Hey, baby.
You came back just in time.

907
00:57:48.663 --> 00:57:51.288
She's about to get it on
with Shakespeare.

908
00:57:51.372 --> 00:57:54.081
-She dressing like a man--
- Shut up.

909
00:57:54.165 --> 00:57:57.957
Yeah, I got you.
I got you on camera.

910
00:57:58.041 --> 00:58:00.875
You on Candid Camera now.

911
00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.876
You ain't know that.

912
00:58:06.169 --> 00:58:09.920
Hello. Hey, girl.
Uh-uh. I�m in the movie.

913
00:58:10.045 --> 00:58:14.964
Shakespeare In Love.
Uh-uh. Ooh! You lying.

914
00:58:15.088 --> 00:58:17.965
For Christ�s sake,
will you just shut your trap!

915
00:58:18.089 --> 00:58:20.424
- Shut up!
- Hold on.

916
00:58:20.508 --> 00:58:23.466
I don't know why you all
is actin' I like this.

917
00:58:23.549 --> 00:58:25.092
My girlfriend already seen the movie.
She said

918
00:58:25.093 --> 00:58:26.635
they don't even stay
together in the end.

919
00:58:26.759 --> 00:58:29.260
Give me that.

920
00:58:29.343 --> 00:58:31.303
Right on.

921
00:58:32.387 --> 00:58:34.303
Will you sit down.

922
00:58:34.387 --> 00:58:36.929
Shut up.

923
00:58:37.054 --> 00:58:40.015
Your ass is grass.

924
00:58:43.515 --> 00:58:46.057
- This is for Thelma!
- And Louise!

925
00:58:46.142 --> 00:58:49.642
This is for talking
through The Fugitive!

926
00:58:49.767 --> 00:58:52.518
- You ruined Schindlers List.
-Jackie Chan movies.

927
00:58:52.602 --> 00:58:56.020
- Boogie Nights!
- And Big Mommas House!

928
00:58:59.521 --> 00:59:03.105
Aaaaaahhhhh!

929
00:59:12.609 --> 00:59:15.903
And I can not marry the daughter
of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

930
00:59:19.278 --> 00:59:23.154
Um, you guys,
there's a few too many people.

931
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:26.489
Oh, honey, please don't throw--
Hey, you guys, stop.

932
00:59:26.614 --> 00:59:28.822
Hey! Hey, please!
That's my dad!

933
00:59:28.907 --> 00:59:31.366
- No, don't touch-- Ah, no!
- Do you have more beer?

934
00:59:31.491 --> 00:59:34.617
- Do you have more beer?
- Um, yeah. Uh, check in the garage.

935
00:59:34.699 --> 00:59:36.826
No, no, no, no!
Don't!

936
00:59:58.583 --> 01:00:01.626
Kitty, you scared me.

937
01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:09.337
Horsey.
Oh, you scared me too.

938
01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:16.882
Hello?
Who's there?

939
01:00:19.715 --> 01:00:22.466
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Please, don't!

940
01:00:22.592 --> 01:00:25.218
Please! I'm just a day player!

941
01:00:40.223 --> 01:00:41.765
Oh, my God!

942
01:01:09.983 --> 01:01:13.069
Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

943
01:01:13.194 --> 01:01:16.277
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!

944
01:01:18.904 --> 01:01:21.447
Yeah!

945
01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:26.781
Oh, Bobby. Bobby.
I was worried about you.

946
01:01:26.906 --> 01:01:29.866
I thought the killer got to you
before I could.

947
01:01:29.949 --> 01:01:31.491
Could what?

948
01:01:31.616 --> 01:01:35.243
I wanna go upstairs.
There's something I wanna show you.

949
01:01:36.743 --> 01:01:39.994
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

950
01:01:40.078 --> 01:01:42.995
- Hey, party on!
- Yeah!

951
01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:51.415
- So--
- So.

952
01:01:51.540 --> 01:01:54.208
Here we are... again.

953
01:01:54.333 --> 01:01:56.375
Yeah.

954
01:01:57.834 --> 01:02:00.293
And, you know,
if you're not ready,

955
01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.670
I'll understand.

956
01:02:04.795 --> 01:02:06.337
Bobby.

957
01:02:06.462 --> 01:02:08.420
I am ready.

958
01:02:09.839 --> 01:02:11.756
- You are?
- Yeah.

959
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:17.257
I cant keep fighting
these urges.

960
01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:21.300
I have to just
give in to them...

961
01:02:21.425 --> 01:02:23.468
and let them flow.

962
01:02:23.593 --> 01:02:25.635
Right.

963
01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.636
- Bobby?
- Huh?

964
01:02:27.761 --> 01:02:30.429
I have been so selfish.

965
01:02:32.762 --> 01:02:34.889
This is like a scene
from a movie or something.

966
01:02:34.973 --> 01:02:37.598
Only it isn't a movie, Bobby.

967
01:02:37.681 --> 01:02:39.600
This is real life.

968
01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:43.225
Its all a movie, baby.

969
01:02:43.350 --> 01:02:45.414
There's the sound guy. There's
the script supervisor.

970
01:02:45.415 --> 01:02:47.477
How you are doin'... baby?

971
01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.227
- Bobby?
- What?

972
01:02:50.436 --> 01:02:55.230
What I mean
is that in real life...

973
01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:57.771
you have to enjoy
each moment.

974
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:24.323
Mmm! Ow!

975
01:03:24.447 --> 01:03:26.491
Bobby.

976
01:03:26.616 --> 01:03:29.158
Bobby!

977
01:03:32.451 --> 01:03:35.119
Can I tell you a secret?

978
01:03:35.201 --> 01:03:37.160
Sure, man.

979
01:03:38.328 --> 01:03:41.329
I see dead people.

980
01:03:41.454 --> 01:03:44.913
Man, this shit is awesome!

981
01:03:44.997 --> 01:03:47.707
Yo, son, we gotta roll
some more of that shit!

982
01:03:47.832 --> 01:03:49.748
Ah, shit!

983
01:03:49.873 --> 01:03:52.208
We don't have
any more papers, man.

984
01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:54.208
We don't have
any more papers.

985
01:03:54.292 --> 01:03:58.085
Oh, man!
What can we use to make a bong?

986
01:04:02.461 --> 01:04:04.920
Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!

987
01:04:05.004 --> 01:04:07.213
- Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
- Yeah!

988
01:04:13.133 --> 01:04:17.342
Oh, shit, son!

989
01:04:17.467 --> 01:04:21.802
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!
Toke! Toke! Toke! Toke!

990
01:04:23.052 --> 01:04:26.929
This some good shit!

991
01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:52.271
- Bobby! I've never done this before.
- What?

992
01:04:53.897 --> 01:04:55.773
Its okay. It�s okay.

993
01:04:55.897 --> 01:04:59.189
It's just like--
It�s like sucking on a Tootsie Roll Pop.

994
01:04:59.274 --> 01:05:02.775
- A Tootsie Pop?
- Yeah, a cherry-flavor one.

995
01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.026
- Oh.
- With the fudge in the middle?

996
01:05:06.151 --> 01:05:08.443
Okay.

997
01:05:08.527 --> 01:05:12.028
Show me now
Show me how

998
01:05:12.154 --> 01:05:15.612
- How it feels when we're together
- Just like that.

999
01:05:15.737 --> 01:05:19.031
-I'm afraid
if we wait
-Just like that, baby.

1000
01:05:19.156 --> 01:05:21.781
- Well be waiting till forever
- Ah!

1001
01:05:21.864 --> 01:05:24.323
Oh! Jesus!

1002
01:05:26.158 --> 01:05:29.242
I never could wait
to get to the chewy middle.

1003
01:05:29.326 --> 01:05:32.284
- You know what? Let me.
- Oh. Okay.

1004
01:05:32.410 --> 01:05:33.911
Goddamn!

1005
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:43.123
I'm flyin' solo
but don't know if I can stop

1006
01:05:43.205 --> 01:05:47.498
Don't ask me why
Don't make me lie

1007
01:05:47.623 --> 01:05:49.791
Just kick back
just sit back

1008
01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:52.000
Enjoy the ride

1009
01:05:55.293 --> 01:05:57.919
Cause I'm a spaceman

1010
01:06:00.253 --> 01:06:02.671
Guess its been a while.

1011
01:06:04.213 --> 01:06:06.423
So stay with me

1012
01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.549
Oh! Oops!

1013
01:06:11.632 --> 01:06:13.550
Its very, uh, '70s of you.

1014
01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:32.972
Oh, yeah.
Oh, Bobby!

1015
01:06:36.058 --> 01:06:38.975
Come here, Bobby!
I want it now!

1016
01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:42.768
Oh, man,
am I fuckin' stoned!

1017
01:06:42.893 --> 01:06:44.811
Yeah, me too, son.

1018
01:06:44.936 --> 01:06:46.853
Hey, you guys hear that?

1019
01:06:51.022 --> 01:06:54.356
Oh!

1020
01:06:59.065 --> 01:07:02.233
Shh!

1021
01:07:02.358 --> 01:07:04.275
Hello?

1022
01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:08.069
- Hello.
What's your favorite scary movie?
- Hello?

1023
01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:14.112
Let me talk to her. Shh!

1024
01:07:16.572 --> 01:07:18.614
I'm gonna gut you like a pig!

1025
01:07:25.659 --> 01:07:28.534
Oh, yeah! Oh!

1026
01:07:28.617 --> 01:07:30.453
Yeah! What's my name, Bobby?

1027
01:07:30.536 --> 01:07:32.703
What? Ah!

1028
01:07:32.828 --> 01:07:36.371
- What's my name, bitch?
- Ow! God! It's Cindy!

1029
01:07:36.495 --> 01:07:39.538
Whose is it, Bobby?
Whose is it, Bobby?

1030
01:07:39.621 --> 01:07:41.664
Its yours.

1031
01:07:41.790 --> 01:07:44.998
Ahhhhhh!

1032
01:07:45.124 --> 01:07:48.291
Oh, my God!

1033
01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:57.170
Oh, shit!

1034
01:08:00.087 --> 01:08:02.546
Don't even contest
Cause I�ll make you undress

1035
01:08:02.630 --> 01:08:05.214
Like porn dancers
waitin' at the front door for an answer

1036
01:08:05.339 --> 01:08:08.466
Hey, yo, I'm sick of artificial MCs
like silicone titties

1037
01:08:08.591 --> 01:08:11.050
Hey, yo, check it, yo.
Fuck a cheap ball

1038
01:08:11.133 --> 01:08:13.133
I wanna smoke Cheech and Chong

1039
01:08:13.218 --> 01:08:15.677
And if I wanna fuck long,
I let my ding-a-long, hit the bong

1040
01:08:15.802 --> 01:08:18.219
And then the song,
Always pass the dutchie to the left

1041
01:08:18.302 --> 01:08:21.220
Because the right way
is wrong

1042
01:08:21.304 --> 01:08:25.013
- Whoo-hoo!
- I got one. I got one.
Here it goes. Ready?

1043
01:08:25.137 --> 01:08:27.931
I'm gonna slash and gash
Cut another hole in your ass

1044
01:08:28.056 --> 01:08:30.598
I spill blood on the walls
then play tennis with your balls

1045
01:08:30.723 --> 01:08:32.641
If the phone rings
don't answer the call

1046
01:08:32.765 --> 01:08:34.766
Gonna slit your throat
fuck you like a goat

1047
01:08:34.891 --> 01:08:37.851
Peel your foreskin off
and make a winter coat
Peace!

1048
01:08:40.310 --> 01:08:43.144
Yo!

1049
01:08:43.269 --> 01:08:47.270
That was the illest rhyme
I ever seen, son!

1050
01:08:49.313 --> 01:08:53.648
Bobby... where were you tonight?

1051
01:08:53.731 --> 01:08:57.024
- What?
- I was just curious.

1052
01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:59.066
What took you so long
to get here?

1053
01:08:59.192 --> 01:09:01.234
Why you so curious?

1054
01:09:02.818 --> 01:09:04.735
I don't know.

1055
01:09:04.819 --> 01:09:07.112
I thought it would fit
the 90s horror clich�...

1056
01:09:07.237 --> 01:09:09.862
if you turned out
to be the killer.

1057
01:09:09.945 --> 01:09:12.697
Oh, so, what? You think
I killed Buffy and Greg?

1058
01:09:14.614 --> 01:09:16.656
Buffy and Greg are dead?

1059
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:19.699
- I thought you knew that.
- Oh, my God!

1060
01:09:19.824 --> 01:09:22.992
Bobby, turn around!
Its the killer!

1061
01:09:37.205 --> 01:09:39.123
Cindy!

1062
01:09:39.248 --> 01:09:42.332
- Oh, my God! Bobby! Bobby!
- Cindy. Help me.

1063
01:09:44.041 --> 01:09:47.291
- Bobby, its okay.
- Gimme the gun. Gimme-

1064
01:09:48.377 --> 01:09:50.960
Its gonna be okay, Bobby.

1065
01:09:52.293 --> 01:09:55.336
Yo, wait for me!
There's a killer in the house!

1066
01:09:55.462 --> 01:09:57.379
There's ass, blood
and guts everywhere!

1067
01:09:57.504 --> 01:09:59.838
Someone done gone crazy,
son!

1068
01:09:59.921 --> 01:10:04.548
We all go a little crazy sometimes.
Bobby, no!

1069
01:10:05.715 --> 01:10:07.924
Oh, shit, son!

1070
01:10:08.049 --> 01:10:10.925
Oh, my God!

1071
01:10:13.051 --> 01:10:15.426
Cindy, he shot me in the lungs.

1072
01:10:17.552 --> 01:10:19.470
You wanna hit this shit?

1073
01:10:23.722 --> 01:10:25.640
Ketchup.

1074
01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:28.056
Just like my mom puts on
her spaghetti, baby.

1075
01:10:30.224 --> 01:10:33.142
Oh, my God! Ray, you�ve gotta help me!
Bobby�s gone crazy!

1076
01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.726
Surprise!

1077
01:10:36.851 --> 01:10:39.644
Surprise, Cindy!

1078
01:10:51.648 --> 01:10:53.732
Why are you doing this, Bobby?

1079
01:10:53.858 --> 01:10:57.483
Why? Why? You hear that, Ray?

1080
01:10:57.608 --> 01:11:00.110
I think she wants
a motive.

1081
01:11:00.235 --> 01:11:02.151
- Did Scream have a plot?
- No.

1082
01:11:02.235 --> 01:11:05.694
Did I Know What You Did Last Summer
make any sense?

1083
01:11:05.779 --> 01:11:08.529
Don't think so!

1084
01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:11.447
What about the sequel?
What was with that fat,
white Jamaican kid?

1085
01:11:11.571 --> 01:11:14.615
- I wanna kill that motherfucker.
- It was bad casting, Bobby.

1086
01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:17.240
How about this for a motive?
Lack of sex!

1087
01:11:17.365 --> 01:11:20.492
It can cause serious
deviant behavior.

1088
01:11:20.617 --> 01:11:24.160
- I thought you loved me.
- Oh, I did, baby.

1089
01:11:24.284 --> 01:11:28.203
I did. But abstinence can make you
discover new things about yourself.

1090
01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.828
That's right, Cindy. I'm gay.

1091
01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:33.663
And in case you haven't noticed,
so is Ray.

1092
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:37.622
What? I ain't gay.

1093
01:11:37.706 --> 01:11:39.353
- What are you talking about?
You took me to that club.

1094
01:11:39.354 --> 01:11:40.999
- So, they play good music.

1095
01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:45.376
- What about our trip
to San Francisco, then?
- I wanted to go shopping.

1096
01:11:47.126 --> 01:11:50.711
- But you made love to me.
- No. First of all, you sucked my--

1097
01:11:50.794 --> 01:11:53.336
Whatever, Ray!
I don't want to talk about this now.

1098
01:11:53.461 --> 01:11:55.358
The point is, I'm a new
man, and I'm ready to

1099
01:11:55.359 --> 01:11:57.255
- leave all this behind
and start a new life.

1100
01:11:57.337 --> 01:12:01.506
- So you killed all your friends?
- Oh, no.

1101
01:12:01.631 --> 01:12:03.506
Just you.

1102
01:12:03.631 --> 01:12:05.883
And maybe Shorty,
but that wasn�t planned or anything.

1103
01:12:06.008 --> 01:12:08.383
But here's the genius part.

1104
01:12:08.467 --> 01:12:11.843
We're copycatting a serial killer
that already exists.

1105
01:12:11.927 --> 01:12:15.720
- Its the perfect crime, Cindy.
- But wait! There's more!

1106
01:12:15.845 --> 01:12:21.138
Hang on to your seat, baby,
cause this one�s a screamer!

1107
01:12:21.263 --> 01:12:24.514
- I'll be back.
- Uh-oh.

1108
01:12:24.639 --> 01:12:27.015
Move your big ass.
Come on.

1109
01:12:27.140 --> 01:12:29.433
Dad!

1110
01:12:29.516 --> 01:12:32.184
What are you gonna do,
frame him?

1111
01:12:32.309 --> 01:12:36.519
Nah. We're just havin' a little bit
of fun with old daddio.

1112
01:12:36.644 --> 01:12:39.811
The police are gonna find
you and daddy both dead,

1113
01:12:39.895 --> 01:12:43.604
and me and Ray are the only survivors
of maniacs revenge.

1114
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:46.648
- You ready? I'm ready.
- You ready? I'm ready to do this shit.

1115
01:12:46.772 --> 01:12:49.231
- Come on. Come on. All right.
- All right.

1116
01:12:49.314 --> 01:12:51.649
- Come on!
- Give it to me. No!

1117
01:12:51.774 --> 01:12:54.775
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1118
01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:57.110
- Ready? All right. Lets do this.
- Wait, wait. Ready.

1119
01:12:57.193 --> 01:12:58.652
- Come on. Come on.
- Ready.

1120
01:12:58.777 --> 01:13:00.319
Give it to me!

1121
01:13:00.444 --> 01:13:02.278
No! Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

1122
01:13:02.361 --> 01:13:04.236
- Remember what we talked about?
To the side.
- I know.

1123
01:13:04.361 --> 01:13:06.237
- How many times
we gonna go over this?
- Okay.

1124
01:13:06.362 --> 01:13:08.321
Stop. Just--
All right. Trust me, okay?

1125
01:13:08.405 --> 01:13:11.072
- All right. I'm ready.
- Trust me. I got this shit. Ready?

1126
01:13:11.198 --> 01:13:14.115
- Wait, wait, wait!
- I'm about to cut your throat, boy!

1127
01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:16.324
Stop acting like a little girl.
Come on. Come on!

1128
01:13:16.408 --> 01:13:17.784
- You're right, you're right, you�re right.
Yeah, come on!

1129
01:13:17.785 --> 01:13:19.159
- Come on. You ready?

1130
01:13:19.241 --> 01:13:22.869
No! You guys are psychos!

1131
01:13:22.952 --> 01:13:25.161
You've seen
one too many TV shows!

1132
01:13:25.286 --> 01:13:29.537
No! Watching television shows
doesn't create psycho killers!

1133
01:13:29.662 --> 01:13:31.997
Cancelin' TV shows does!

1134
01:13:32.121 --> 01:13:34.414
The Wayans Brothers
was a good show, man!

1135
01:13:34.497 --> 01:13:39.041
It was a good-ass show,
and we didn't even get a final episode!

1136
01:13:39.166 --> 01:13:42.335
Take it easy!
I'm feelin' a little woozy here!

1137
01:13:42.417 --> 01:13:45.210
Its my turn.
Give me the knife.

1138
01:13:45.335 --> 01:13:48.295
Fuck outta here.
Ain't nobody stabbin' me.

1139
01:13:56.963 --> 01:13:59.505
Surprise, Cindy!

1140
01:14:52.441 --> 01:14:55.443
All right, all right.
Hold on a second.

1141
01:14:55.568 --> 01:14:58.110
Just give me a moment.
Ah. One--

1142
01:15:03.779 --> 01:15:05.989
Oh, yeah. That's it.

1143
01:15:06.113 --> 01:15:09.115
Ah. Okay.

1144
01:15:42.502 --> 01:15:44.710
Dad!

1145
01:15:44.794 --> 01:15:47.253
Are you okay?

1146
01:15:47.378 --> 01:15:50.254
I thought I told you
not to have a party unless I was here.

1147
01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.838
But, Dad, you were here.
You were in the closet.

1148
01:15:52.921 --> 01:15:56.423
Oh, yeah, that's right. Did you get some
girlfriends numbers for me?

1149
01:15:56.547 --> 01:15:59.591
- Dad, they're dead.
- Ah, you know, I cant get a break.

1150
01:15:59.716 --> 01:16:02.134
-- What's that? Is that the cops?

1151
01:16:02.216 --> 01:16:04.759
Okay, okay, listen, honey.
Help me up now.

1152
01:16:04.843 --> 01:16:07.968
Uh-- Uh-- If the cops come, tell em
I'm a plumber, okay?

1153
01:16:08.094 --> 01:16:09.970
You had a leaky faucet,
and you called, and

1154
01:16:09.971 --> 01:16:11.845
they sent me over. We
don't know each other.

1155
01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:21.181
No! No!

1156
01:16:21.266 --> 01:16:23.266
Dad, Dad, put your arms down.

1157
01:16:25.725 --> 01:16:28.934
- What the hells goin' on here?
- Sheriff, it�s a bloodbath in there.

1158
01:16:29.059 --> 01:16:30.976
- He was right here! I swear it!
- Who was?

1159
01:16:31.060 --> 01:16:34.436
The killer!
The guy that murdered all my friends!

1160
01:16:34.519 --> 01:16:38.229
And the sick bastard planted drugs
all in the house there.

1161
01:16:38.313 --> 01:16:41.231
- All over the place.
- Dad. Stop it.

1162
01:16:41.356 --> 01:16:44.106
All right, Cindy.
I'm gonna have to take you
down to the station.

1163
01:16:44.231 --> 01:16:46.232
I'm cool, though, right?

1164
01:16:46.357 --> 01:16:48.315
- I'm okay?
- Lets-- Lets go, Cindy.

1165
01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.734
Cindy. Call me.

1166
01:16:52.151 --> 01:16:54.068
Daddy'll get you out, honey.

1167
01:16:56.568 --> 01:17:00.529
Okay. Lets go over this again.

1168
01:17:13.075 --> 01:17:14.992
- You say it was an accident.
- Yes.

1169
01:17:15.075 --> 01:17:18.243
- He was on the road.
- And you think he came back
to get revenge?

1170
01:17:18.368 --> 01:17:21.203
It has to be him, Sheriff.

1171
01:17:26.788 --> 01:17:28.872
Here, Sheriff.
They wanted me to give this to you.

1172
01:17:28.955 --> 01:17:31.998
- That�ll be all, Doofy.
- Okay.

1173
01:17:32.124 --> 01:17:34.541
- I'm gonna go, then. All right.
- All right.

1174
01:17:35.749 --> 01:17:37.626
Bye, Cindy.

1175
01:17:40.834 --> 01:17:43.210
I�m sorry, Cindy.
It wasn't the man you guys killed.

1176
01:17:43.335 --> 01:17:45.045
His name was David Keegan.
Some fishermen

1177
01:17:45.046 --> 01:17:46.754
found his body a
few weeks later.

1178
01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:50.296
- He's buried in Lakewood Cemetery.
- That's impossible.

1179
01:17:52.672 --> 01:17:55.048
- Then I don't know who it could be.
- He's gotta be someone else...

1180
01:17:55.173 --> 01:17:56.862
who was connected
with all the victims,

1181
01:17:56.863 --> 01:17:58.550
someone who knew
about the accident.

1182
01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:01.300
Someone who could move around
without being noticed.

1183
01:18:03.635 --> 01:18:06.760
Oh, my God.

1184
01:18:06.843 --> 01:18:10.679
She used to baby-sit my brother Doofy.
He had the biggest crush on her.

1185
01:18:10.803 --> 01:18:13.680
Its me, Cindy.

1186
01:18:13.763 --> 01:18:15.347
Night, Cindy.

1187
01:18:19.265 --> 01:18:21.348
- Doofy!
- Shit head?

1188
01:18:24.642 --> 01:18:26.559
- Have you seen Doofy?
- No.

1189
01:18:26.642 --> 01:18:28.851
- Have you seen Doofy?
Has anybody seen Doofy?
- No, Sheriff.

1190
01:18:28.936 --> 01:18:31.436
- No.
- Yeah.
Just went out the back, Sheriff.

1191
01:18:31.561 --> 01:18:33.770
Doofy!

1192
01:18:46.857 --> 01:18:50.234
He walks alone
under the big city lights

1193
01:18:50.359 --> 01:18:54.070
He always knows
just when the time is right

1194
01:18:54.194 --> 01:18:57.570
He never shows what he's thinking
He keeps it inside

1195
01:18:57.695 --> 01:19:01.405
Because he's
too cool for school

1196
01:19:01.487 --> 01:19:04.990
He comes alive
when the sun goes down

1197
01:19:05.114 --> 01:19:08.574
He gets it right
You know he's always down

1198
01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:12.158
He's got one eye open
and his ear to the ground

1199
01:19:12.283 --> 01:19:15.243
And he's too cool for school

1200
01:19:17.035 --> 01:19:20.495
He's an operator
He's a real player

1201
01:19:20.579 --> 01:19:24.121
- And if you mess with him
you know you'll never win

1202
01:19:24.246 --> 01:19:29.123
No-o-o-o-o!

1203
01:19:43.877 --> 01:19:47.504
Shit, son. Yo, what the deal?

1204
01:19:47.588 --> 01:19:50.340
Yo, if you all watchin'
this tape right now,

1205
01:19:50.422 --> 01:19:52.422
that means
I didn't make it.

1206
01:19:52.506 --> 01:19:56.342
Either I'm a prisoner,
or worse, dead.

1207
01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:58.613
But either way it goes,
I'm gonna tell you

1208
01:19:58.614 --> 01:20:00.801
all the rules to survive
this situation.

1209
01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:04.051
You gotta be quick.

1210
01:20:04.135 --> 01:20:07.470
Don't fall down.

1211
01:20:07.554 --> 01:20:12.597
Whatever you do, never look back.

1212
01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:14.890
You all wish me luck.

1213
01:20:15.014 --> 01:20:16.973
Snatch and run, you all!

1214
01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:22.058
Come back here, you motherfuckers!
Son of a bitch!
