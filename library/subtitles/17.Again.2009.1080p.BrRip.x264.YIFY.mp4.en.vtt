00:00:58.058 --> 00:01:00.642
O'Donnell, save something for the game.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:02.811
I'm just warming up, coach.

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:05.481
Just talked to the scout again.
He's coming tonight.

00:01:05.648 --> 00:01:07.900
You play half the game
I know you're capable of...

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.277
...he's prepared to offer you
a full scholarship.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:13.489
Free ride to college
and the world's your oyster, kid.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:15.991
Thanks, coach.

00:01:16.993 --> 00:01:19.787
All right, jockstraps,
let's gather up. Picture time.

00:01:19.954 --> 00:01:21.246
Try not to break the camera.

00:01:23.124 --> 00:01:24.917
We gotta hang on. Ned's not here yet.

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:26.668
Who cares? He's the water boy.

00:01:26.836 --> 00:01:29.171
That doesn't matter,
because he's part of the team.

00:01:29.547 --> 00:01:31.840
Sorry I'm late! Sorry I'm late!

00:01:33.968 --> 00:01:35.677
But what kind of Dungeon Master
would I be...

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:39.056
...if I left my party in the middle
of a battle with a hippogriff?

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:41.141
Check it out, it's Merlin the Girlin.

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:46.980
Um, Ned, Ned, look, I'm your best friend,
all right, and I'll always have your back.

00:01:47.148 --> 00:01:50.067
But there's only so much I can do
when you show up in a dress.

00:01:50.235 --> 00:01:53.487
O'Donnell. How about you and Boy George
join us for this picture?

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:55.239
- Yep. Yep.
- Just one sec.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:59.201
Give the little guy the sign, please.
Here we are.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.036
Nice, guys. Scoot up in back.

00:02:01.204 --> 00:02:04.081
Come on, you gotta look pretty
for the ladies, right? Come on.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.376
Yeah. Let's do it. Three, two, one.

00:03:18.948 --> 00:03:20.282
Hey, Vanilla Ice.

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:23.285
We got a game here. Let's bring it in.

00:03:25.038 --> 00:03:27.623
Man, I had to. I had to.

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.374
Oh, man, over there.

00:03:31.628 --> 00:03:34.755
Who is that stone-cold fox?

00:03:34.923 --> 00:03:38.300
Oh, it's my girlfriend.

00:03:39.802 --> 00:03:40.886
Take no prisoners, bro.

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:44.473
Oh, hey, there's my girl.
- Hey.

00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:48.644
I'm glad you're here, Scar. This whole
scout thing has me wicked nervous.

00:03:48.811 --> 00:03:51.647
I just feel like my whole future's
riding on this game.

00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:55.067
Yeah. Yeah, I know how you feel.

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:57.236
Yeah? Is everything...?
Everything's cool, right?

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:59.655
Oh, yeah. Everything's totally copacetic.

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:01.406
- Totally?
- Totally.

00:04:01.991 --> 00:04:03.158
O'Donnell.

00:04:03.326 --> 00:04:05.744
I gotta go. See you.

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.170
You okay?

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.089
Uh, uh...

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.510
- We can talk about it later.
- No. Just tell me.

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.428
It's your big night. Go enjoy it.

00:04:23.596 --> 00:04:26.431
I can't enjoy it unless you tell me
what's going on.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.850
Okay.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.894
Um...

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:53.000
O'Donnell!

00:05:13.646 --> 00:05:15.397
Wake up!

00:05:15.565 --> 00:05:16.732
O'Donnell!

00:05:16.899 --> 00:05:20.319
What are you doing?

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:58.899
Scar! Scar, hey.

00:05:59.067 --> 00:06:00.108
Hey, Scarlet.

00:06:00.276 --> 00:06:03.820
- Hey, hey. Hey, what are you doing?
- Mike, what are you doing?

00:06:03.988 --> 00:06:06.948
Look, you and me,
we're in this together, okay?

00:06:07.116 --> 00:06:10.619
- But the game. That's your future.
- No, the baby's my future.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:12.954
- That's crazy.
- You're my future.

00:06:13.122 --> 00:06:16.208
I can't let you throw this all away.
I won't let you.

00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:06.591
Thank you for letting me stay here, Ned.

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:09.511
Oh, yeah. No problem.

00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:14.516
- You good on the Cap'n?
- I'm good on the Captain.

00:07:18.521 --> 00:07:20.188
Hey, Mike?

00:07:20.857 --> 00:07:24.693
Mike, I can tell you're down,
but trust me on this.

00:07:24.861 --> 00:07:27.529
You're looking at Scarlet
kicking you out of the house...

00:07:27.697 --> 00:07:31.992
...and the kids wanting nothing to do
with you as a negative, when in fact...

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:38.039
- I guess it's mostly negative, isn't it?
- Well, yeah.

00:07:38.207 --> 00:07:40.375
I had no upside for that.

00:07:41.043 --> 00:07:43.545
Hey! You're getting that
big promotion today, right?

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.380
Yes. Yes, I am.

00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:48.216
Today everything turns around for me.

00:07:48.384 --> 00:07:50.177
Knock them dead.

00:07:51.554 --> 00:07:53.096
I love you!

00:08:06.903 --> 00:08:08.403
So anyway...

00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.572
...the way corporate
wants us to spin it...

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:13.742
...is that maybe, in certain situations...

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:17.370
...a four-hour erection
isn't such a terrible thing.

00:08:18.414 --> 00:08:20.582
Okay. Next up:

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:25.003
As most of you know, today I am proud to
be naming our new regional sales manager.

00:08:25.171 --> 00:08:26.755
- Here we go.
- You know...

00:08:27.256 --> 00:08:32.761
...I've been in the pharmaceutical game
for almost two years now...

00:08:32.929 --> 00:08:36.223
...and people always ask me:
"What's it take to be an RSM?"

00:08:37.099 --> 00:08:38.099
Leadership.

00:08:39.852 --> 00:08:40.936
Courage.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.438
Integrity.

00:08:44.023 --> 00:08:48.401
But most importantly,
dedication to this company.

00:08:49.445 --> 00:08:51.947
So congratulations. Mike.

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:57.285
Mike, if you could slide to your left so I
can congratulate our new RSM, Wendy!

00:08:57.453 --> 00:08:59.579
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:09:01.624 --> 00:09:04.292
Go out there and push some pills,
my peeps.

00:09:04.502 --> 00:09:05.919
Good job, baby!

00:09:06.963 --> 00:09:08.964
Bye-bye, thanks.

00:09:09.131 --> 00:09:11.591
See you at practice. Mmm.

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:17.180
Mike. What's crack-a-lacking, coz?

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.600
Well, I'll tell you what's crack-a-lacking.
Are you kidding me?

00:09:20.893 --> 00:09:24.479
Wendy's been here two months.
I've been here 16 years.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.314
I got the best numbers on the team.

00:09:26.482 --> 00:09:28.817
You should think of it as a compliment.

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:34.072
Think of it as us saying,
"You're just too valuable to promote. "

00:09:35.449 --> 00:09:36.825
- You little...
- Shh, shh, shh, hello?

00:09:36.993 --> 00:09:39.995
Hey, buddy. No, no, no, I got time.

00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:44.332
Ha. I know, right?
Look, listen, she was my doubles par...

00:09:49.213 --> 00:09:52.924
So many girls and only one promotion,
but you guys are so supportive.

00:09:53.092 --> 00:09:55.343
- But, Wendy, you did it.
- Thank you.

00:09:55.511 --> 00:09:58.263
Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!

00:09:58.431 --> 00:10:00.765
You guys! OMG.

00:10:00.933 --> 00:10:05.020
Oh, and it gets better,
because we are going to T.G.I. Friday's!

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:06.646
- Shut up!
- Aah!

00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:15.048
Mike O'Donnell.

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.094
Do I know you?

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.596
No. But I know you.

00:11:22.264 --> 00:11:23.556
Oh, yeah?

00:11:24.225 --> 00:11:27.894
High school star.
Never quite lived up to your potential.

00:11:29.438 --> 00:11:32.482
Sooner or later you all come back
to the old school.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:36.111
Stand there and look at the picture
of the glory days...

00:11:36.278 --> 00:11:38.613
...wondering what might have been.

00:11:39.365 --> 00:11:41.950
Seems to me you guys
are living in the past.

00:11:42.785 --> 00:11:45.328
Well, of course I want to live in the past.

00:11:45.496 --> 00:11:47.080
It was better there.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.960
I'll bet you wish you had it
to do all over again.

00:11:52.586 --> 00:11:55.004
Huh. You got that right.

00:11:57.717 --> 00:11:59.134
You're sure about that?

00:12:00.469 --> 00:12:02.011
Oh, yeah.

00:12:03.013 --> 00:12:05.390
Dad.
- Hi, Mr. O'Donnell.

00:12:06.142 --> 00:12:08.059
- Ladies.
What are you doing here?

00:12:08.227 --> 00:12:10.145
Oh, I was just talking to...

00:12:11.021 --> 00:12:12.480
...nobody.

00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:17.485
Doesn't matter. I got off work early,
and I thought we could get ice cream.

00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.029
Together?

00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.825
- Why?
- Just go get your brother, okay?

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.162
Do you need anything else?

00:12:27.329 --> 00:12:28.955
No, we're fine.

00:12:33.043 --> 00:12:35.503
What's the matter?
This used to be your favorite place.

00:12:35.671 --> 00:12:38.673
- We used to come here for your birthday.
- When I was, like, 8.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.184
So, Al, basketball season's coming up.

00:12:49.351 --> 00:12:50.393
- You ready?
- Yeah.

00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:52.353
- Been working on that outside shot?
- Mm-hm.

00:12:52.521 --> 00:12:53.646
- Passing?
- Good.

00:12:53.814 --> 00:12:55.440
- Dribbling?
- Really good.

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.525
Good's not going to get you
a scholarship.

00:12:57.693 --> 00:13:00.361
I meant, it's great.
It's great, Dad. It's great.

00:13:00.529 --> 00:13:02.947
That's my boy. Remember,
it's not how big you are.

00:13:03.115 --> 00:13:04.157
It's how big you play.

00:13:04.408 --> 00:13:05.742
Right up here.

00:13:06.243 --> 00:13:08.620
Uh, Maggie got into Georgetown.

00:13:09.705 --> 00:13:11.122
Maggie, that's awesome.

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:13.708
Can you turn down the?

00:13:31.310 --> 00:13:34.103
Okay, guys, see you soon.

00:13:35.564 --> 00:13:40.068
Love you. Nice chatting with you.

00:13:51.914 --> 00:13:56.584
What the hell are you doing?

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.171
Hey, that's my stuff.

00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.885
Why are you destroying our yard?

00:14:06.053 --> 00:14:08.096
It's not our yard. It's my yard, remember?

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:12.183
You took the road not taken.
And I get the yard.

00:14:16.605 --> 00:14:19.023
I'm going to turn it into a showpiece
for my clients.

00:14:19.191 --> 00:14:22.402
- Clients of what?
- Landscape design.

00:14:22.570 --> 00:14:23.778
Landscape design?

00:14:23.946 --> 00:14:26.281
I'm going to show people what I can do.

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:31.452
Yeah, well, the divorce isn't final for
another two weeks, so you have no right.

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:35.790
Really? So I've spent the last 18 years
of my life listening to you whine...

00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:39.210
...about the things you could've done
without me, and I have no right?

00:14:39.378 --> 00:14:42.589
- It's just I put a lot of work into this yard.
- Did you?

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:45.133
Really? Like the barbeque pit?

00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.551
Yeah.

00:14:46.719 --> 00:14:50.805
Yeah. The way I remember that is that
you spent about an hour working on it...

00:14:50.973 --> 00:14:54.767
...and then you spent the next two days
complaining about...

00:14:54.935 --> 00:14:57.979
...if you had gone to college,
you could've hired someone to do it.

00:14:58.147 --> 00:15:01.399
- I don't think it was a whole two days.
- Or the hammock over here.

00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:02.650
Yeah.

00:15:02.818 --> 00:15:06.905
I think you quit that one because
you just decided not to try anymore.

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.699
Look, try to see things
from my point of view.

00:15:09.867 --> 00:15:12.577
I am extremely disappointed with my life.

00:15:12.745 --> 00:15:14.495
I never asked you to marry me.

00:15:14.663 --> 00:15:15.997
Yeah, but I did.

00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.044
Well...

00:15:22.254 --> 00:15:25.465
...you don't have to do me
any more favors, then.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.092
We're not going to hold each
other back anymore, okay?

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:31.804
- Scar...
- I'll see you at court, okay? At the trial.

00:15:31.972 --> 00:15:33.306
Scarlet.

00:15:33.474 --> 00:15:34.515
Naomi!

00:15:34.683 --> 00:15:36.684
- You came.
Of course I came.

00:15:36.852 --> 00:15:40.229
What bridesmaid would I be if I
didn't hold your hand during the divorce?

00:15:40.397 --> 00:15:44.108
Now, just remember.
The first one's always the hardest.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:45.610
- Mike.
- Naomi.

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.153
- Naomi.
- I don't care.

00:15:47.321 --> 00:15:50.448
Let's get going. We got to get you ready.
Back on the market.

00:15:50.616 --> 00:15:51.824
Yeah, I'm a real catch.

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:56.037
Single mom with two teenage kids
and manure caked under my fingernails.

00:15:56.205 --> 00:15:58.665
You'll do great. You got the butt
of a 12-year-old boy.

00:15:58.832 --> 00:16:01.125
That's terrific.
I hope our daughter heard that.

00:16:01.293 --> 00:16:03.836
Ugh. When was the last time you waxed?

00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:09.676
Bye, Mike.

00:16:15.057 --> 00:16:16.391
Bye.

00:16:47.673 --> 00:16:49.382
MAN
You're sure about that?

00:16:59.727 --> 00:17:01.269
Jesus.

00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:16.409
Hey! Get off of there!

00:17:31.467 --> 00:17:33.634
Oh, no. Hello?

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:37.180
Hello?! Hello?!

00:17:44.605 --> 00:17:46.314
What the?

00:17:50.569 --> 00:17:53.029
Oh, no!

00:18:39.618 --> 00:18:41.661
Oh, man.

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.166
Ned?

00:18:47.501 --> 00:18:48.709
Thief!

00:18:48.877 --> 00:18:52.296
No, no, no, Ned!
Ned, no, no, no! It's me!

00:18:56.969 --> 00:18:59.428
Stop! Stop!

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:06.435
Ned?

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:12.483
Oh, wow. I feel great.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.069
Ha, ha.

00:19:18.073 --> 00:19:19.490
What are you doing? No, Ned.

00:19:20.409 --> 00:19:22.743
- Aah! Aah!
- No.

00:19:25.747 --> 00:19:27.582
No, no, no, Ned!

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:40.386
Ned! Come on! It's me, it's Mike!

00:19:45.058 --> 00:19:48.769
Ned, Ned, Ned, I'm telling you,
I'm telling you, stop it! Stop it! Now!

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:51.439
Oh.

00:19:51.607 --> 00:19:53.274
An elegant weapon...

00:19:53.442 --> 00:19:55.902
...from a more civilized time.

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:04.368
Hey, it's me! It's Mike O'Donnell,
your best friend!

00:20:06.121 --> 00:20:07.955
You have an undescended testicle.

00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:10.458
Googleable!

00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:11.834
Ned!

00:20:13.337 --> 00:20:15.796
You helped me cheat on my math test,
but I got caught.

00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:18.049
Public record!

00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:28.559
You asked Princess Leia to junior prom.

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:31.145
Covered by the local news.

00:20:38.779 --> 00:20:40.905
I can't breathe!
I can't breathe!

00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.160
Please.

00:20:46.328 --> 00:20:47.745
- Oh!
- Ha, ha!

00:20:50.249 --> 00:20:51.624
Oh, my God.

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:54.919
No, no, no.

00:20:55.087 --> 00:20:56.629
Ned, Ned.

00:20:58.006 --> 00:20:59.590
Oh, my God.

00:21:11.311 --> 00:21:14.313
Would you stop staring at me?

00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:17.525
- It's freaking me out.
- It's freaking me out!

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.652
I'm pubescent!

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.534
Okay. So, uh...

00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:28.536
...it's a classic transformation story.

00:21:28.996 --> 00:21:31.747
It appears in the literature
time and time again.

00:21:31.915 --> 00:21:34.250
Were you at any point shot
by a gamma ray?

00:21:35.335 --> 00:21:38.087
- No.
- Exposed to gamma radiation of any kind?

00:21:38.255 --> 00:21:40.172
- No, Ned.
- No?

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:42.550
You wouldn't see it. Okay.

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:46.929
That eliminates these and those
and most of that side.

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:52.184
Are you now or have you ever been...

00:21:53.395 --> 00:21:56.314
...a Norse god, vampire,
or time-traveling cyborg?

00:21:56.481 --> 00:21:59.400
I've known you since, what, first grade?
I would have told you.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.154
Vampire wouldn't tell.
Cyborg wouldn't know.

00:22:03.322 --> 00:22:04.822
Shut up.

00:22:05.407 --> 00:22:10.077
Okay, if it's not any of those,
I guess, um, we're looking at your basic...

00:22:11.121 --> 00:22:14.540
...spirit guide transformation magic.
That's kind of a biggie, actually.

00:22:15.542 --> 00:22:17.460
That is here.

00:22:17.627 --> 00:22:19.378
When the hero...

00:22:19.546 --> 00:22:22.006
- I guess that's... I guess, you.
- Hm.

00:22:22.174 --> 00:22:25.926
Uh, is transformed by his spirit guide...

00:22:26.094 --> 00:22:27.762
...to set him on a new path.

00:22:28.221 --> 00:22:30.598
- Which is what?
- Do I look like your spirit guide?

00:22:36.521 --> 00:22:37.855
The janitor.

00:22:39.608 --> 00:22:40.941
The janitor.

00:22:53.163 --> 00:22:55.456
You guys seen the janitor?
You seen the janitor?

00:22:55.624 --> 00:22:58.042
- Do you know where the janitor is?
No.

00:22:58.210 --> 00:23:01.295
Hey, where's the janitor?
Where does the janitor work?

00:23:01.463 --> 00:23:03.464
- Excuse me!
- You all right, kid?

00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:05.966
- There's another janitor who works here.
- Just me.

00:23:06.134 --> 00:23:08.969
No, no. There's an older guy
with white hair who works here.

00:23:09.137 --> 00:23:13.766
I was here yesterday talking to the janit...
I showed him this picture of me.

00:23:13.934 --> 00:23:16.060
You?
- Yeah.

00:23:16.228 --> 00:23:18.979
That picture's from 1989.

00:23:21.441 --> 00:23:23.818
Right. Forget it.

00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:31.784
Alex!

00:23:31.952 --> 00:23:33.327
Alex, buddy!

00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:35.746
Alex!

00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:11.991
Hello?

00:24:14.244 --> 00:24:16.162
Spirit guide?

00:24:17.706 --> 00:24:19.665
What am I supposed to do?

00:24:19.833 --> 00:24:22.376
Don't know what I'm supposed to do.

00:24:29.926 --> 00:24:32.178
Ouch. Oh, ow.

00:24:32.345 --> 00:24:35.264
I got shot. Did I get shot or did I get...?
Someone got powned.

00:24:38.268 --> 00:24:40.060
- It's a grenade.
Ned.

00:24:40.604 --> 00:24:42.146
Aah! Oh, sorry. Teenage you.

00:24:42.314 --> 00:24:45.191
I figured it out.
I figured out what I'm supposed to do.

00:24:45.358 --> 00:24:47.568
I figured out what my spirit guide
wants me to do.

00:24:47.819 --> 00:24:48.986
I'm going back.

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.407
I'm going back to high school, Ned!

00:24:53.575 --> 00:24:56.076
No! No, no. No way.

00:24:56.244 --> 00:24:59.079
Your spirit guide would not waste
transformation magic...

00:24:59.247 --> 00:25:01.916
...on you reliving your senior year
and going to prom. No.

00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:07.004
Ned, this is my chance to have my life over,
but to do it right.

00:25:07.172 --> 00:25:09.340
- Wouldn't you, if you had the chance?
- No.

00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:12.092
I'm rich, and nobody stuck
my head in a toilet today.

00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:14.011
Sure. Besides, it's not just about me.

00:25:14.179 --> 00:25:18.265
- It's about you.
- No, it's much bigger than me.

00:25:18.433 --> 00:25:20.559
- It's about you.
- Okay, maybe it's about me...

00:25:20.727 --> 00:25:22.269
...but what's wrong with that?

00:25:22.437 --> 00:25:25.397
I have not done anything
for me since 1989.

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:30.361
You do what you have to do. But don't
think about sucking me into this with you.

00:25:30.529 --> 00:25:32.404
Hayden was the low point
of my existence...

00:25:32.572 --> 00:25:36.867
...and I vowed I would never go back
to that godforsaken place!

00:25:37.035 --> 00:25:40.287
Never, ever, ever!

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:43.707
Never! Never, ever, ever!

00:25:46.878 --> 00:25:48.587
I hate you.

00:25:49.798 --> 00:25:51.131
Hello.

00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:54.301
I'm here to enroll my son...

00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:56.428
...in school.

00:25:56.596 --> 00:25:58.013
Mark.

00:25:58.473 --> 00:26:00.140
What's up?

00:26:02.352 --> 00:26:04.687
So...

00:26:07.649 --> 00:26:10.484
So we'll just have a seat
till you're ready for us.

00:26:10.652 --> 00:26:12.486
We'll be right, uh... Okay.

00:26:21.496 --> 00:26:22.663
What's this you're wearing?

00:26:24.499 --> 00:26:29.253
This is cool. This is hip. I have a picture
of Kevin Federline wearing the same thing.

00:26:29.421 --> 00:26:31.672
- I don't know who that is.
- What are you wearing?

00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:33.257
- I told you, like a dad.
- I am.

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:35.593
- You look like Clay Aiken.
- Leave him out of this.

00:26:38.179 --> 00:26:42.224
Are you sure these look legit?
- Oh, yeah. Look who you're talking to.

00:26:42.392 --> 00:26:47.187
I'm the guy who invented the software
that prevents people from stealing music.

00:26:48.023 --> 00:26:50.482
I also invented the software
that helps people steal music...

00:26:50.650 --> 00:26:52.026
...but that's a happy coincidence.

00:26:53.069 --> 00:26:55.487
What is that?

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:58.032
Oh, my G...

00:26:58.199 --> 00:26:59.950
- Wrong. These are for me.
- You kidding?

00:27:00.118 --> 00:27:03.871
- What's-her-name and Chewie's for me.
- Miss Masterson will see you now.

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:05.122
Let's go.

00:27:06.708 --> 00:27:08.542
Just don't try to be funny, all right?

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:10.794
Say as little as possible.

00:27:10.962 --> 00:27:13.464
Hey, watch where you're going, toolbag.

00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:17.092
- So sorry, sir. Our fault.
- Stan.

00:27:22.057 --> 00:27:25.684
Hello. I'm Jane Masterson,
principal here at Hayden High.

00:27:25.852 --> 00:27:27.394
Hi.

00:27:39.741 --> 00:27:42.576
Hello.

00:27:42.744 --> 00:27:44.912
Hi.
- Hi.

00:27:45.622 --> 00:27:46.914
Uh, okay.

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:49.875
Yeah, I think we're good here.

00:27:50.251 --> 00:27:51.794
Sorry.

00:27:53.463 --> 00:27:55.839
I think our hands just made a baby.

00:27:56.007 --> 00:28:00.719
Excuse my dad. He's not used to
talking to attractive women.

00:28:00.887 --> 00:28:02.513
Oh, thank you...

00:28:03.264 --> 00:28:04.556
- Mark.
Mark...

00:28:04.724 --> 00:28:08.394
...for that flattering
yet totally inappropriate comment.

00:28:08.561 --> 00:28:09.770
Please sit.

00:28:11.856 --> 00:28:15.943
Before we get started, I think you should
know that, uh, Mark's a bastard.

00:28:17.278 --> 00:28:18.404
Excuse me?

00:28:18.571 --> 00:28:20.572
I had him out of wedlock, so...

00:28:21.199 --> 00:28:22.950
...I'm single.

00:28:23.284 --> 00:28:24.451
And I'm very rich.

00:28:27.706 --> 00:28:29.289
Okay.

00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:31.959
- Did you bring your transcripts?
- Oh, yeah.

00:28:32.794 --> 00:28:34.211
Transcripts.

00:28:34.379 --> 00:28:38.048
Last school you went to was
Cutler High in Connecticut.

00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.217
Straight-A student. Very impressive.

00:28:42.095 --> 00:28:43.137
Math club...

00:28:43.304 --> 00:28:45.639
...National Merit finalist...

00:28:45.807 --> 00:28:48.892
...Coney Island
Hot Dog Eating Champion.

00:28:53.982 --> 00:28:56.984
Well, I think Hayden
would be lucky to have you.

00:28:57.819 --> 00:29:00.112
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

00:29:06.369 --> 00:29:08.829
Uh, yes, Mr. Gold.
Do you have a question?

00:29:10.039 --> 00:29:11.832
Your hair is pretty.

00:29:12.709 --> 00:29:16.086
Ah. Not a question, but thank you.

00:29:17.505 --> 00:29:19.757
Would the lady mind if I smelled it?

00:29:19.924 --> 00:29:23.510
Now is probably a good time to tell you
that I don't date students' parents.

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:29.016
Well, maybe I should tell you that I never
don't not date the principal of my child.

00:29:29.184 --> 00:29:31.977
Okay, come on, Dad. Come on, Dad.

00:29:32.145 --> 00:29:34.229
Let's go.

00:29:35.190 --> 00:29:36.982
I was about to close!

00:29:37.817 --> 00:29:40.360
You have to do it right now?
Just calm down. You're a dad.

00:29:40.528 --> 00:29:44.156
- Hi. Oh, my gosh. We're in.
- You see her undress me with her eyes?

00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:46.158
I don't think that's what that was.

00:29:46.326 --> 00:29:49.453
Hey. Wow. I don't know how we did it.

00:29:49.621 --> 00:29:51.246
It's Maggie's friends. Watch this.

00:29:51.414 --> 00:29:53.957
- Hey, girls, how's it going?
Do I know you?

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:55.417
What'd you do, mug K-Fed?

00:29:59.714 --> 00:30:02.382
Welcome to the bottom
of the food chain.

00:30:04.552 --> 00:30:07.971
Hey, look, you always had
my back in high school, okay?

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.891
So if your spirit guide
wants you to be a fake teenager...

00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.018
...and me to be your fake dad...

00:30:13.186 --> 00:30:16.355
...the least I can do is make sure
that my fake son doesn't look...

00:30:17.232 --> 00:30:19.024
...like a total douche.

00:30:19.484 --> 00:30:22.236
- I don't look like a douche.
What a douche.

00:30:22.612 --> 00:30:24.446
We're going shopping.

00:30:24.614 --> 00:30:27.241
- Really?
- Yes, your shirt is bedazzled.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:29.743
Bedazzled with rhinestones.

00:30:50.098 --> 00:30:51.098
Ooh.

00:30:51.266 --> 00:30:53.100
Let's go to school.

00:30:53.268 --> 00:30:54.434
Hey, yo, check it out.

00:30:54.602 --> 00:30:56.103
That's just rude.

00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:40.188
What's up, dude?

00:31:45.987 --> 00:31:47.696
What are you looking at, punk?

00:31:49.157 --> 00:31:51.158
- Watch it.
- Wake up, douche.

00:31:53.912 --> 00:31:55.746
Sorry.

00:31:58.333 --> 00:32:01.168
No phones, no texting.

00:32:02.921 --> 00:32:05.589
Settle, people. Settle down.

00:32:05.757 --> 00:32:08.425
Take the roughhousing outside, class.

00:32:13.222 --> 00:32:14.640
Hello?

00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:17.935
- Hello?
- Where the hell are you?

00:32:19.812 --> 00:32:21.521
Oh, cr...

00:32:21.689 --> 00:32:24.691
- The thing.
You mean our divorce?

00:32:24.859 --> 00:32:26.610
Do you take any of this seriously?

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:29.821
No, no! Yes, I take this seriously.

00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:33.617
I had to leave the country
very suddenly, uh...

00:32:33.785 --> 00:32:36.536
...with the Mayan... Inca,
I'm with the Incas in Peru.

00:32:36.704 --> 00:32:38.664
We think we might have found the next...

00:32:39.999 --> 00:32:41.041
...Rogaine.

00:32:43.002 --> 00:32:44.378
Are you with a girl?

00:32:44.545 --> 00:32:47.381
No, no. It's, uh, a bunch of cheerleaders.

00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:51.009
So would you consider
maybe dating a 10th-grader?

00:32:51.177 --> 00:32:53.053
I think we could go for full custody.

00:32:53.221 --> 00:32:55.305
No, you can't take my kids
away from me.

00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:57.557
Since when do you care?

00:33:02.271 --> 00:33:03.313
Look...

00:33:05.233 --> 00:33:07.693
...I'm a lot closer to them than you think.

00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:10.237
Let's reschedule, okay?

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:14.282
Hey, Maggie.

00:33:17.537 --> 00:33:20.080
Um, why is the new kid waving at me?

00:33:20.248 --> 00:33:21.999
I don't know.

00:33:22.166 --> 00:33:24.167
But if that boy were an apple...

00:33:24.335 --> 00:33:25.794
...he'd be a Delicious.

00:33:26.587 --> 00:33:28.088
Oh, God.

00:33:32.176 --> 00:33:35.512
Gosh, we are all in such great shape.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.264
Oh, jeez.

00:33:37.432 --> 00:33:40.517
Man, you know, I will tell you something.

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:43.603
In 10 years you're going
to have this thing right here...

00:33:43.771 --> 00:33:48.400
...that no amount of crunches will
get rid of. And spot reduction, total lie.

00:33:48.568 --> 00:33:50.444
You know, I...

00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:53.572
Never mind. Give me the ball.

00:33:54.449 --> 00:33:55.782
Fakes right, goes left.

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:57.909
And signature move.

00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:00.787
Kid.

00:34:04.208 --> 00:34:06.918
- I'm Coach Murphy.
- Oh, wow.

00:34:07.086 --> 00:34:09.629
- You're still here?
- What?

00:34:10.798 --> 00:34:12.090
You're a legend.

00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:15.510
Yeah. Well, yeah. Twenty years.

00:34:15.678 --> 00:34:18.180
It's actually my last one.

00:34:18.347 --> 00:34:21.099
Good hops, kid. Nice handle.

00:34:21.642 --> 00:34:23.226
We're looking for a point guard.

00:34:23.644 --> 00:34:24.811
Oh, yeah?

00:34:26.522 --> 00:34:30.150
- Why don't you come to tryouts?
- Okay.

00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:33.570
- I'm done talking to you.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:34:36.532 --> 00:34:37.616
Hey, how's it going?

00:34:37.784 --> 00:34:38.825
MIKE
Things are looking up.

00:34:38.993 --> 00:34:41.828
Coach Murphy practically
put me on the team.

00:34:41.996 --> 00:34:44.581
That's not a coincidence.
We're on the path.

00:34:44.749 --> 00:34:48.001
That's great. That's super you're finding
your destiny and, blah, blah, whatever.

00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:50.587
Here's something.
I need you to do something for me.

00:34:50.755 --> 00:34:52.339
I need you to get in trouble.

00:34:52.507 --> 00:34:53.965
Not, like, big trouble.

00:34:54.133 --> 00:34:57.803
Just enough trouble so that the principal
needs to meet with your father.

00:34:57.970 --> 00:34:59.596
Yeah, okay, well, we'll see.

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:01.807
- Oh! Boom.
BOY Ned!

00:35:01.974 --> 00:35:03.100
Boom. Checkmate, Samir!

00:35:03.267 --> 00:35:05.102
- Damn it!
Checkmate.

00:35:05.812 --> 00:35:08.605
Uh, can I get a little help in here?

00:35:11.484 --> 00:35:12.609
Alex?

00:35:19.492 --> 00:35:20.867
How does it...?

00:35:22.453 --> 00:35:25.163
- Who did this to you?
- The basketball team.

00:35:26.332 --> 00:35:29.709
But why? Why? You're one of them.

00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:31.128
You're popular.

00:35:31.796 --> 00:35:35.966
Uh, look, this is kind of personal,
and I don't know you.

00:35:36.134 --> 00:35:37.342
- I'm taped to the toilet.
- Yeah.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:42.055
I'm sorry, I'm Mark Gold, uh,
your uncle Ned's kid. I just started here.

00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:44.307
Oh, cool. Cool, yeah.

00:35:44.475 --> 00:35:46.685
Well, I'd shake your hand...

00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:48.979
...but it's taped to my ass.
- Right. Right.

00:35:49.147 --> 00:35:50.355
Would you mind?

00:35:50.523 --> 00:35:53.233
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, um.

00:35:53.401 --> 00:35:55.569
- Just rip.
- I'm going to get it.

00:35:56.571 --> 00:35:57.863
- Band-Aid.
- Go for it.

00:36:02.201 --> 00:36:03.910
So how come we never met?

00:36:05.913 --> 00:36:08.915
My mom didn't want anyone to know
she had a kid with Ned.

00:36:09.584 --> 00:36:11.168
- That makes sense.
- Yeah.

00:36:11.419 --> 00:36:14.254
So since we're practically
family and all...

00:36:14.422 --> 00:36:17.924
...my dad says we should just
keep an eye on each other, you know?

00:36:18.092 --> 00:36:19.551
Uh, yeah. Why not?

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:22.762
Next time you could get there
before they tape me to the toilet.

00:36:22.930 --> 00:36:24.472
You got it.

00:36:26.559 --> 00:36:28.393
This looks good.

00:36:34.108 --> 00:36:35.483
Who's that?

00:36:35.735 --> 00:36:36.943
Oh, uh...

00:36:37.111 --> 00:36:38.778
- Nicole.
- Are you two going out?

00:36:38.946 --> 00:36:41.489
No, no, she's the, uh, head cheerleader.

00:36:41.949 --> 00:36:43.450
She'd never go out with me.

00:36:43.618 --> 00:36:46.453
You know, when I first met
your mother, I was so nervous...

00:36:46.621 --> 00:36:48.121
You met my mother?

00:36:48.289 --> 00:36:49.539
- What?
- My mother.

00:36:49.707 --> 00:36:52.417
You said, "The first time I met
your mother, I was nervous. "

00:36:52.793 --> 00:36:55.712
- Oh, that's weird. Is your mom hot?
- Dude, what...?

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:59.799
- What do I say to that?
- I was joking. Joking, dude.

00:37:03.638 --> 00:37:04.971
Stan.

00:37:07.642 --> 00:37:09.142
I hate that guy.

00:37:09.769 --> 00:37:11.978
- Oh.
- Thanks.

00:37:12.146 --> 00:37:13.188
What?
- Huh.

00:37:13.356 --> 00:37:15.523
- Freshman.
Good sandwich.

00:37:16.901 --> 00:37:19.152
Is that the guy
who taped you to the toilet?

00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.528
Yeah.

00:37:20.696 --> 00:37:23.740
Yesterday he shoved me in a
washing machine in my own house.

00:37:23.908 --> 00:37:27.327
- What was that jerk doing at your house?
- It's Maggie's boyfriend.

00:37:28.829 --> 00:37:30.664
Maggie has a boyfriend?

00:37:33.042 --> 00:37:34.501
Well...

00:37:35.211 --> 00:37:37.504
...I'm very disappointed in your sister.

00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:41.925
He's looking. Don't make eye contact.
He's kind of temperamental.

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:45.345
- You're looking. Stop it, stop it.
- I'll look at him.

00:37:45.513 --> 00:37:47.389
Hey, twinkle douche.

00:37:48.683 --> 00:37:53.270
If I wanted you in the cafeteria,
I would've taped you to a lunch lady.

00:37:54.021 --> 00:37:56.273
You little punk.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.692
You don't talk to him that way.

00:38:01.654 --> 00:38:02.988
Yeah?

00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:05.865
What are you gonna do?

00:38:10.871 --> 00:38:11.997
What am I gonna do?

00:38:14.417 --> 00:38:15.667
First...

00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:18.670
...I'm going to call your father.

00:38:22.258 --> 00:38:23.800
Heads up!

00:38:32.351 --> 00:38:35.228
Give me my ball back, bitch.

00:38:35.396 --> 00:38:37.731
You know, Stan, I feel sorry for you.

00:38:38.357 --> 00:38:40.900
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

00:38:41.068 --> 00:38:42.736
All too well.

00:38:43.571 --> 00:38:44.779
You're the man.

00:38:44.947 --> 00:38:47.073
Captain of the basketball team.

00:38:47.241 --> 00:38:49.492
Dates the pretty girls.

00:38:50.536 --> 00:38:52.829
High school is your kingdom.

00:38:53.748 --> 00:38:55.707
But, people...

00:38:55.875 --> 00:38:57.959
...Stan's a bully.

00:38:58.127 --> 00:38:59.586
Why?

00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:05.717
It'd be way too easy to say Stan preys
on the weak simply because he's a dick.

00:39:05.885 --> 00:39:07.093
No.

00:39:07.261 --> 00:39:09.429
No, no.

00:39:09.597 --> 00:39:11.264
Stan here...

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:14.267
...is much more complex than that.

00:39:14.727 --> 00:39:17.437
See, according to leading psychiatrists...

00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:20.899
...Stan's a bully for one of three reasons.

00:39:21.609 --> 00:39:23.026
One:

00:39:23.819 --> 00:39:25.737
Underneath all of that male bravado...

00:39:25.905 --> 00:39:29.783
...there's an insecure little girl banging
on the closet door trying to get out.

00:39:32.953 --> 00:39:34.454
Two:

00:39:34.622 --> 00:39:36.373
Like a caveman...

00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.708
...Stan's brain is...

00:39:38.876 --> 00:39:41.252
...underdeveloped.

00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.464
Therefore, Stan is unable
to use self-control.

00:39:44.632 --> 00:39:46.800
And so he acts out aggressively.

00:39:48.010 --> 00:39:49.969
And the third reason:

00:39:50.846 --> 00:39:52.430
Stan has a small wiener.

00:40:12.034 --> 00:40:14.035
Don't hurt yourself, big boy.

00:40:24.004 --> 00:40:26.923
Whoa, whoa, hey. Drinking age is still 21,
thank you very much.

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:30.927
Unless your spirit guide gave you
a fake ID, this is mine.

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:36.474
What are you eating?

00:40:36.642 --> 00:40:39.394
I don't even know.
I just know I'm hungry.

00:40:39.562 --> 00:40:41.020
All the time.

00:40:41.188 --> 00:40:42.897
Okay, that's not safe or sanitary.

00:40:43.065 --> 00:40:45.817
That's your can now.
We'll label it like that.

00:40:49.029 --> 00:40:51.197
So, what did you learn at school today?

00:40:53.325 --> 00:40:56.202
- That I'm a bad dad.
- I thought it was going great.

00:40:56.370 --> 00:40:59.205
It was going fantastic for me.

00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:00.790
And then what?

00:41:03.085 --> 00:41:07.172
And then I found out my son spent the
last year being the school punching bag...

00:41:07.339 --> 00:41:11.092
...and watched my daughter get a
tongue bath from a psychopathic jackass.

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:13.136
High school's delightful, isn't it?

00:41:13.304 --> 00:41:16.681
Yeah. But I think I was wrong
about my spirit path.

00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:18.975
And who was right? See? I told you.

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:21.144
I told you high school
was the wrong thing.

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:25.023
High school was right,
but it's not about basketball.

00:41:25.191 --> 00:41:27.734
It's about helping Alex and Maggie.

00:41:30.237 --> 00:41:31.279
Mmm.

00:41:32.615 --> 00:41:34.491
All right. I'm getting out of here.

00:41:35.367 --> 00:41:37.744
- Disgusting.
- My kids need their father.

00:41:44.585 --> 00:41:47.253
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, Mark.

00:41:50.424 --> 00:41:51.591
What was that?

00:41:52.927 --> 00:41:54.511
A three-pointer.

00:41:56.388 --> 00:41:58.389
Can you do that twice in a row?

00:42:02.269 --> 00:42:05.855
Okay. Let's see you do it
with a little pressure.

00:42:12.863 --> 00:42:15.406
Wow, you're great.
You should be on the team.

00:42:17.034 --> 00:42:20.745
You should be on the team.
I'm going to get you on the team.

00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:24.749
That's it. That'll solve everything.

00:42:25.084 --> 00:42:27.126
Dude, what are you talking about?

00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:28.628
Nothing.

00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:39.722
Well, that was fun. I haven't been to
happy hour in, like, a week and a half.

00:42:39.890 --> 00:42:43.059
Naomi, thank you so much.
That is exactly what I needed.

00:42:43.227 --> 00:42:44.769
Oh, great.

00:42:44.937 --> 00:42:47.480
Mike who?
- Mike who? I've never heard of the guy.

00:42:47.648 --> 00:42:48.940
Ow.

00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:52.902
Hey, Mom, this is Mark,
Uncle Ned's bastard.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.362
Wow.

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.657
I know. Someone had a kid
with Uncle Ned. Ew.

00:42:59.243 --> 00:43:01.327
You okay, Mrs. O'Donnell?

00:43:02.121 --> 00:43:03.162
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:43:03.330 --> 00:43:06.207
It's "Ms.," kid. It's "Ms.," Scarlet.
Don't forget that.

00:43:06.375 --> 00:43:07.625
Oh, right.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:13.256
Wow.

00:43:14.550 --> 00:43:18.261
You look just like my husband.
Doesn't he?

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:21.723
- My ex-husband. That is so weird.
- Heh, heh.

00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:23.016
It is weird.

00:43:23.183 --> 00:43:24.851
What is that?

00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:26.477
Scarlet, I need you to come.

00:43:26.645 --> 00:43:27.854
Weird.

00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:29.522
- Do you see that?
- I did see it.

00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:32.025
You see him?
- She's nice.

00:43:32.401 --> 00:43:33.443
But look at him.

00:43:33.611 --> 00:43:36.779
You gotta let that guy go,
just out of your brain and move on.

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:39.949
I know you need to grieve
a relationship. It's only natural.

00:43:40.117 --> 00:43:41.367
Okay.

00:43:41.535 --> 00:43:44.120
You wait here.
I'm going to go smell him.

00:43:44.288 --> 00:43:47.624
No, no, no. Sweetie.
You're not allowed to smell teenagers.

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:51.044
Sweetie, you need to hear me on this.
Here's the thing.

00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:53.087
The other thing,
you need to acknowledge...

00:43:53.255 --> 00:43:56.549
...that he looks exactly like Mike
used to look in high school.

00:43:56.717 --> 00:44:00.470
We discussed that. I have looked at him.
But, honey, this is the thing:

00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:02.722
You need to hook up with someone new.

00:44:02.890 --> 00:44:07.727
Yeah, I deserve to have somebody
smile at me and tell me I'm pretty.

00:44:07.895 --> 00:44:09.562
- You do.
- Even if it is...

00:44:09.730 --> 00:44:12.148
...to just get me to go home with him.

00:44:12.316 --> 00:44:17.195
Or lunch. But, yes, we're gonna
find you a new playmate. Ow!

00:44:17.363 --> 00:44:19.822
You little turd. You little snot.

00:44:19.990 --> 00:44:21.491
My bad. Gosh, I'm so sorry.

00:44:21.659 --> 00:44:25.745
I guess I was, uh, kind of distracted,
as I imagine Alex was...

00:44:25.913 --> 00:44:29.207
...at hearing about how his mother,
who is still married, by the way...

00:44:29.375 --> 00:44:31.876
...is planning to run around
with every guy she can get.

00:44:32.044 --> 00:44:35.838
In Afghanistan, she'd be dragged through
the streets by goats with her hands cut off.

00:44:36.006 --> 00:44:37.924
I'm just saying. I'm just saying, Naomi.

00:44:38.092 --> 00:44:40.385
- Naomi.
- I don't care.

00:44:55.776 --> 00:44:57.652
- Hey, guys.
Oh.

00:44:58.070 --> 00:44:59.779
Okay, settle down. Take your seats.

00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:03.616
Thank you, thank you. Thank you, Stan.
Thank you.

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:09.455
Okay, today we will be continuing
our discussion on human sexuality.

00:45:09.623 --> 00:45:14.585
And as we discussed,
the official school policy is abstinence.

00:45:14.753 --> 00:45:16.462
Now, that is very sensible.

00:45:16.630 --> 00:45:19.590
I'm glad that someone here
has their head screwed on straight.

00:45:19.758 --> 00:45:23.386
I think all of us should make a pact
to abstain from sex.

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.805
Now, who's with me, you guys?
Come on.

00:45:27.141 --> 00:45:28.224
Oh, my God.

00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:32.895
- Maggie?
- Hm?

00:45:33.689 --> 00:45:35.273
However, let's get real.

00:45:35.441 --> 00:45:38.735
I know asking high school seniors
to be abstinent...

00:45:38.902 --> 00:45:42.822
...is like asking a porcupine
to poop goat cheese. Yuck.

00:45:43.198 --> 00:45:47.493
So since the majority of you are or will
become sexually active at some point...

00:45:47.661 --> 00:45:52.457
But that point should be way,
way in the future, right?

00:45:52.624 --> 00:45:55.126
Well, the official school position...

00:45:55.294 --> 00:45:57.503
...is that we prepare you
for safe sex now.

00:45:58.881 --> 00:46:01.674
So please take one and pass it down.

00:46:07.514 --> 00:46:09.348
I have needs.

00:46:11.018 --> 00:46:14.771
- You don't need these.
Stan, give one to Mark.

00:46:14.938 --> 00:46:19.108
No. No, you know what, he's right.
He's right. I don't need one.

00:46:19.276 --> 00:46:23.029
You know why I don't need one?
Because there's no one I'm in love with.

00:46:23.197 --> 00:46:25.239
It's called "making love," isn't it?

00:46:25.407 --> 00:46:30.787
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but I think that
means you do it with someone you love.

00:46:31.038 --> 00:46:33.372
And preferably when you're married.

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:38.294
You know, when you're ready to take
that love and turn it into a baby.

00:46:39.588 --> 00:46:41.756
Because that's what love is.

00:46:41.924 --> 00:46:45.051
It's that first moment
when you hold your baby girl...

00:46:45.844 --> 00:46:50.890
...and you didn't know that anything
could be so small or so delicate.

00:46:51.058 --> 00:46:53.976
And you feel that tiny heart beat...

00:46:54.561 --> 00:46:58.689
...and you know that you couldn't love
anything more in the whole world.

00:47:00.067 --> 00:47:03.236
And you hope that you can do right
by that little girl...

00:47:04.112 --> 00:47:08.157
...and always be there to catch her when
she falls, and that nothing ever hurts her.

00:47:08.325 --> 00:47:10.868
Not a broken arm...

00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:13.246
...or a bad dream...

00:47:15.999 --> 00:47:17.750
...or a broken heart.

00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:26.342
- I don't want these. Just take them.
Me either.

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:27.885
Are you serious?

00:47:28.345 --> 00:47:30.805
Great, fine, wonderful.

00:47:30.973 --> 00:47:32.682
More for me.

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:35.768
Now I got enough
for the whole weekend.

00:47:38.981 --> 00:47:40.022
Oh, my God!

00:47:41.775 --> 00:47:43.985
- Stan!
- Boys, stop it!

00:47:44.236 --> 00:47:45.903
Break it up! Get off him, Stan!

00:47:48.073 --> 00:47:49.699
Put those phones away! Stop it!

00:47:50.617 --> 00:47:52.368
- Stop hitting him!
No fighting!

00:47:53.787 --> 00:47:56.372
- You like that?
- You're gonna go to jail again.

00:48:00.627 --> 00:48:02.628
Look at that.
He slapped him like a mother.

00:48:02.796 --> 00:48:04.255
That thing sucks.

00:48:05.966 --> 00:48:08.301
- Oh!
- Oh, that's wrong.

00:48:09.636 --> 00:48:12.013
Yo, check this out.
My cousin in New York sent it to me.

00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:25.526
I hope I'm not late for our meeting.

00:48:25.694 --> 00:48:28.821
Busted for fighting, nice. Who won?

00:48:28.989 --> 00:48:31.991
You know, it was actually pretty even.

00:48:32.451 --> 00:48:33.659
Really?

00:48:33.827 --> 00:48:36.162
On YouTube it looked like
you got your ass kicked.

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:38.205
I saw it a couple times.

00:48:39.166 --> 00:48:41.042
- What are you wearing?
- Hm?

00:48:41.501 --> 00:48:43.544
- Beckham.
- No, what?

00:48:43.712 --> 00:48:45.254
Oh, the clothes. Oh, right.

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:47.757
To the untrained eye,
I look like a total idiot.

00:48:47.925 --> 00:48:49.258
You do, in fact.

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:53.930
Ah. But it's actually a seduction technique
known as "peacocking. "

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:58.351
My outfit serves the dual function
of icebreaker and attention-getter.

00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:01.270
You can go in now.

00:49:01.855 --> 00:49:03.356
Watch.

00:49:10.197 --> 00:49:11.530
Are you peacocking?

00:49:12.491 --> 00:49:14.367
Really? You think that's gonna work?

00:49:14.534 --> 00:49:15.993
I think it just might.

00:49:25.712 --> 00:49:29.757
Is that? Mrs. O'Donnell!
How you doing?

00:49:29.925 --> 00:49:31.092
Hello, how are you?

00:49:31.259 --> 00:49:32.677
I'm good. How are you?

00:49:32.844 --> 00:49:34.428
Good.

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:38.265
Wow.
This is gonna take some getting used to.

00:49:39.059 --> 00:49:40.184
You're Ned's son?

00:49:40.352 --> 00:49:42.603
Yeah. Yeah. Ned gave birth to me.

00:49:42.771 --> 00:49:45.564
Well, he didn't give birth...
You know what I meant.

00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:49.402
You're doing some gardening.

00:49:49.569 --> 00:49:52.029
- I'm redoing the backyard.
- Oh.

00:49:52.239 --> 00:49:53.322
You want to see?

00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:56.325
Yeah, sure. I got some time.

00:49:58.954 --> 00:50:00.246
Oh, wow.

00:50:00.414 --> 00:50:04.750
Yeah. Obviously, I still have a lot to do.

00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:07.044
- You can put that...
- Right here?

00:50:07.212 --> 00:50:08.504
All right.

00:50:09.256 --> 00:50:10.840
Thank you.

00:50:11.049 --> 00:50:13.009
- So this is it.
- This is it.

00:50:13.176 --> 00:50:14.593
It used to look a lot worse.

00:50:16.096 --> 00:50:17.638
Mm-mm.

00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:23.352
Basically, uh, what I planned to do was
to put a pond in over here...

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.063
- Okay.
... and have water...

00:50:26.231 --> 00:50:28.816
...streaming in from both sides.

00:50:29.443 --> 00:50:33.070
And then put a big deck right here...

00:50:33.238 --> 00:50:38.951
...and then a flagstone patio there
with sod in between.

00:50:39.119 --> 00:50:40.536
That would be pretty.

00:50:40.704 --> 00:50:45.958
And then to have twinkling lights
above the whole thing...

00:50:46.126 --> 00:50:48.627
...so that every night is a starry one.

00:50:48.795 --> 00:50:50.129
Heh.

00:50:50.297 --> 00:50:52.631
It's gonna be amazing, Scar.

00:50:52.799 --> 00:50:54.050
What did you just call me?

00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:56.052
Uh...

00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:58.804
- I just said, "It'll be amazing. "
- You called me "Scar. "

00:50:59.639 --> 00:51:01.682
My husband's the only one
who calls me that.

00:51:01.850 --> 00:51:03.392
Could you use some help?

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:07.396
Volunteer. I'm young, I'm strong.

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.190
Oh. Oh.

00:51:09.357 --> 00:51:11.484
Right, got it. Okay.

00:51:14.029 --> 00:51:17.573
I realize that whole
lady cougar hunting...

00:51:17.741 --> 00:51:22.161
...the "mothers I'd like to,"
you know, whatever, thing...

00:51:22.329 --> 00:51:25.664
...is big with you guys, right?
With you high school boys?

00:51:25.832 --> 00:51:28.417
But that's not gonna happen
between me and you.

00:51:28.585 --> 00:51:30.961
I didn't even mean it that way.

00:51:31.129 --> 00:51:36.175
I was thinking more along the lines of
business experience, college application.

00:51:36.343 --> 00:51:38.803
But if you want to go there, that's...

00:51:38.970 --> 00:51:40.971
- So I'll just get you a shovel, then?
- Yeah.

00:51:41.139 --> 00:51:42.348
Okay.

00:52:30.772 --> 00:52:31.814
What?

00:53:09.352 --> 00:53:13.439
I said we could do it!
- Called it.

00:53:13.607 --> 00:53:15.733
Did you see the look on Stan's face?

00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:21.238
Alex? What happened at the tryouts?
How'd it go?

00:53:21.448 --> 00:53:25.534
It was good. Mark had a great tryout.
He played great.

00:53:25.702 --> 00:53:28.204
- Yeah.
- And so did I. I made the team.

00:53:28.371 --> 00:53:31.207
Really? Oh, great! That's so good.
I'm so proud of you.

00:53:31.374 --> 00:53:32.625
Me too.

00:53:32.792 --> 00:53:34.293
He did great out there.

00:53:34.461 --> 00:53:36.378
Oh, Mark. That's super inappropriate.

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:38.464
L... Good job today.

00:53:38.632 --> 00:53:39.924
- Good job!
- Thanks.

00:53:40.091 --> 00:53:43.260
I want to show you something.
Come here. I wanna show you guys.

00:53:45.972 --> 00:53:48.307
Ta-da.

00:53:49.559 --> 00:53:51.727
- You hung the lights.
Yes.

00:53:52.187 --> 00:53:53.812
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:56.232
I wanted you guys to be the first to see.

00:53:56.399 --> 00:53:58.067
- Mom, it's sick.
Really?

00:53:58.235 --> 00:54:00.236
It's so good.

00:54:00.695 --> 00:54:02.696
Oh, my gosh.

00:54:04.699 --> 00:54:07.493
Mark. Mark, we should go practice, dude.

00:54:07.661 --> 00:54:10.246
The game's on Friday.
Mom, such a good job.

00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:16.919
What do you think?

00:54:17.087 --> 00:54:18.462
It's amazing.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:23.342
When people see how talented you are,
you'll be designing gardens all over the city.

00:54:23.510 --> 00:54:24.843
Really?

00:54:25.011 --> 00:54:26.679
Well, thank you, Mark. That's nice.

00:54:31.309 --> 00:54:32.351
Oh.

00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:37.022
- I have to go. I have a date tonight.
- You have a...? You have a date?

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:40.818
I'm going dancing, which is ridiculous
because I'm a terrible dancer.

00:54:41.444 --> 00:54:44.321
- You're an amazing dancer.
- What?

00:54:45.573 --> 00:54:47.366
- Hm? Ahem.
- Wh...?

00:54:47.534 --> 00:54:49.285
You just look like you can move.

00:54:49.452 --> 00:54:51.203
Um, okay.

00:54:51.371 --> 00:54:54.873
I'm going to go, so have fun, Mark.

00:54:55.041 --> 00:54:56.542
Night.

00:55:13.351 --> 00:55:15.936
- What are you looking at?
- That was great.

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:18.731
That is The Snake.

00:55:19.399 --> 00:55:21.483
That was a very hot dance
when you were 1.

00:55:22.902 --> 00:55:24.820
- Teach it to me.
- I can't.

00:55:24.988 --> 00:55:27.114
It's a very advanced step...

00:55:27.282 --> 00:55:30.826
...which I know is hard to believe
because I make it look effortless.

00:55:31.745 --> 00:55:33.662
That's the secret to all great dancers.

00:55:34.622 --> 00:55:36.206
Try me.

00:55:39.210 --> 00:55:41.211
Why did you pick that song?

00:55:41.379 --> 00:55:44.840
Oh, I don't know.
It just, uh, kind of spoke to me.

00:55:45.008 --> 00:55:47.009
Hm. That's funny.

00:55:47.177 --> 00:55:50.095
That's the song that my husband
and I danced to at our wedding.

00:55:50.263 --> 00:55:52.389
Hm. A man of good taste.

00:55:52.557 --> 00:55:54.641
- Want me to show you some dance moves?
- I'd love to.

00:55:54.809 --> 00:55:56.101
That I learned at my wedding.

00:55:56.269 --> 00:56:00.647
- Great.
- Yeah. Okay, you stand here, like that.

00:56:00.815 --> 00:56:03.275
Okay, like that, and I'll stand here.

00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:06.445
- No, you stand right there.
- Right there.

00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:10.991
Okay, ready? So you go
right foot back and then left foot back.

00:56:11.493 --> 00:56:15.120
And then quick
right, left, right, left, right.

00:56:15.288 --> 00:56:17.956
And then right... Oh.

00:56:18.124 --> 00:56:21.043
That was good.
And left, right, left, right.

00:56:21.878 --> 00:56:23.087
That's good.

00:56:23.254 --> 00:56:26.215
That was really good.
You're picking that up pretty quickly.

00:56:26.383 --> 00:56:28.342
So you mentioned your husband.
- Mm-hm.

00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:30.803
Do you think you guys are ever
going to get back together?

00:56:30.970 --> 00:56:33.138
Um, no.

00:56:34.015 --> 00:56:35.641
Why are you so sure?

00:56:35.809 --> 00:56:39.019
Maybe there's something he could do
to fix things.

00:56:39.187 --> 00:56:42.356
I love my husband and care about him...

00:56:44.401 --> 00:56:46.568
...but sometimes that just is not enough.

00:56:48.696 --> 00:56:50.739
Well, he blew it.

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:52.282
Jump.

00:57:08.133 --> 00:57:09.675
- Mom?
- Yeah.

00:57:12.554 --> 00:57:13.595
Hey, Alex.

00:57:15.056 --> 00:57:17.641
- Mom?
I'm your mom.

00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:19.810
I am Alex's mom, Mark.

00:57:19.978 --> 00:57:21.270
Yeah.

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:24.690
- Your date is here.
- Huh?

00:57:25.525 --> 00:57:27.359
- The front door. Your date.
- Okay.

00:57:27.694 --> 00:57:29.862
She was nervous. It's creepy, right?

00:57:30.029 --> 00:57:31.613
Little bit.

00:57:31.781 --> 00:57:34.032
She's so old, it's like...

00:57:35.201 --> 00:57:36.869
Dance with all your friend's moms?

00:57:37.036 --> 00:57:38.370
Pretty much.

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:40.622
Oh, hi, Scarlet.
- Hello.

00:57:40.790 --> 00:57:43.292
- Wow, you look amazing. Here. Pour vous.
Oh, thank you.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:46.044
Carnations. What a douche bag.

00:57:46.212 --> 00:57:47.463
Mark.

00:57:47.630 --> 00:57:49.548
No, that's okay.
- I'm sorry.

00:57:49.716 --> 00:57:50.757
I'm a single dad.

00:57:50.925 --> 00:57:54.553
It's totally normal for sons to
feel weird when their moms date.

00:57:54.721 --> 00:57:58.015
I mean, he's stepping into
Dad's shoes, protecting the castle.

00:57:58.183 --> 00:58:00.225
- He's not my son, but...
- Oh.

00:58:00.894 --> 00:58:02.269
Then that's weird.

00:58:02.437 --> 00:58:03.687
- It is.
Yeah.

00:58:03.855 --> 00:58:05.814
- Uh, do you want to go?
- Yeah.

00:58:06.274 --> 00:58:07.399
Let me get my coat.

00:58:07.567 --> 00:58:09.401
- Oh, come on.
- Hold these, please.

00:58:09.569 --> 00:58:10.903
- This guy?
- You're being rude.

00:58:11.070 --> 00:58:12.905
- You're going from Uncle Mike to this guy?
- Shh.

00:58:13.072 --> 00:58:15.491
- Be quiet.
- Okay.

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:18.494
- Do me a favor. Shh.
- He's a tool.

00:58:18.661 --> 00:58:22.331
Give this to Ned, okay, to give to Mike.
It's our divorce papers.

00:58:22.499 --> 00:58:25.751
And remind him that he needs
to be there on the 27th.

00:58:25.919 --> 00:58:28.253
Okay? Thank you.

00:58:53.488 --> 00:58:54.655
Where are you going?

00:58:54.822 --> 00:58:56.615
Jamie's party.

00:58:59.786 --> 00:59:01.411
Alex!

00:59:04.249 --> 00:59:07.125
Yeah, uh, seriously, I can't be here.
I really can't be here.

00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:10.754
Do you know how many dangerous and
hurtful things Stan could do to me here?

00:59:10.922 --> 00:59:13.799
You had your head shoved in a
ball return? It's not a massage.

00:59:13.967 --> 00:59:16.718
You're on the basketball team now.
Okay? This is your party.

00:59:17.428 --> 00:59:19.054
Okay, okay, there she is.

00:59:19.222 --> 00:59:20.597
There's Nicole. Oh, God.

00:59:20.765 --> 00:59:22.432
- Which one?
She's right there.

00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:24.434
You're looking at... She's my 3, your 2.

00:59:24.602 --> 00:59:26.603
- Stop it. You're looking right at her.
- Calm down.

00:59:28.147 --> 00:59:29.648
- Sorry.
- What was that?

00:59:29.816 --> 00:59:31.984
- Nothing, it was a burp.
- Why are you burping?

00:59:32.151 --> 00:59:34.653
- I have tummy issues. What? Get over it.
- Tummy issues?

00:59:35.029 --> 00:59:36.905
She's not going to like me. I'm a loser.

00:59:37.073 --> 00:59:40.117
Why are you a loser?
Because Stan says you're a loser?

00:59:40.285 --> 00:59:43.161
Do you think Stan's a winner?
Stan's going nowhere.

00:59:43.538 --> 00:59:46.748
Any girl in here would be lucky
to have your attention.

00:59:46.916 --> 00:59:50.335
- What do you know about girls?
- What do I know about girls?

00:59:51.129 --> 00:59:53.463
I used to date the
most beautiful girl in school...

00:59:53.631 --> 00:59:55.549
...and I let her slip through my fingers.

00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:57.676
But I won't let that happen to you.

00:59:58.177 --> 00:59:59.428
You're absolutely right.

00:59:59.596 --> 01:00:02.264
I'm just going to walk up to her
and introduce myself.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:05.684
Tomorrow at school. Maybe.
Probably not.

01:00:05.852 --> 01:00:07.394
Just go.

01:00:12.025 --> 01:00:13.942
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, you came.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.277
- How are you?
- Good.

01:00:15.445 --> 01:00:18.030
Thank you, um. Have you seen Maggie?
I've been looking everywhere.

01:00:18.197 --> 01:00:20.699
Oh, um, Maggie's not here.

01:00:20.867 --> 01:00:22.701
But, um, I am.

01:00:22.869 --> 01:00:25.495
And I'm really, really glad you came.

01:00:26.873 --> 01:00:29.833
It's her birthday.
- I didn't get you a present, I'm sorry.

01:00:30.001 --> 01:00:32.836
- I'll just have to unwrap you.
- Heh, heh. Okay.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:38.634
I was kicked off the cheerleading squad
for being too flexible.

01:00:42.263 --> 01:00:46.183
Okay, okay. Sit down. Just sit down.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.396
If you girls don't respect yourselves...

01:00:51.564 --> 01:00:55.275
...then how do you expect
anyone else to respect you?

01:00:55.568 --> 01:00:56.693
Right?

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:57.903
Don't respect me.

01:00:58.071 --> 01:00:59.363
No, don't respect me.

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:01.657
You don't even have to
remember my name.

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:03.909
- Wow, that's slutty.
- First of all, you slut.

01:01:04.118 --> 01:01:06.328
This is some other dad's problem.

01:01:07.914 --> 01:01:11.041
And, um, I just want to tell you
that you look like my dog.

01:01:11.834 --> 01:01:15.712
- Excuse me?
- Your hair looks like my dog's hair.

01:01:15.963 --> 01:01:18.256
- Oh, um...
- No, it's shiny and soft.

01:01:18.424 --> 01:01:20.717
We give my dog special food.
It's got flax in it.

01:01:20.885 --> 01:01:22.761
Oh, flax.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.596
- She's a sweetheart.
- That's sweet.

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:26.181
Well, she died.

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:29.309
So I look like your dead dog?

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.604
I'm just really nervous, and I've wanted
to talk to you for so long.

01:01:32.772 --> 01:01:35.107
- What am I thinking?
- Don't worry about it. Really.

01:01:35.274 --> 01:01:37.567
- Alex?
- Oh, my God, you know my name.

01:01:37.735 --> 01:01:38.902
You're on fire.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:42.114
- Really?
- Literally, you're on fire.

01:01:42.281 --> 01:01:43.365
What?

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:45.033
Literally on fire.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:48.954
Whoa. Okay. Yeah, I'm gonna
get out of here. Later.

01:01:54.627 --> 01:01:56.253
Just hand me those keys right there.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:57.546
They're in for the night.

01:01:58.965 --> 01:02:03.760
If the keys are locked in there, I don't
know how I'm going to get you guys out.

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:07.264
Conserve some oxygen in there.

01:02:07.432 --> 01:02:10.475
Don't scream, you have
a limited amount of oxygen.

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:14.396
They're pretty, huh?
We got some pretty ladies in here.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.607
Oh, there you are.

01:02:32.165 --> 01:02:35.125
- What do you want?
- I just want to talk about Stan.

01:02:35.334 --> 01:02:36.710
Yeah?

01:02:37.837 --> 01:02:41.590
Why are you dating him?
I mean, you know he is not a nice guy.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:43.133
He's crazy.

01:02:43.301 --> 01:02:46.011
Hey, don't say that about Stan.
You don't even know him.

01:02:46.179 --> 01:02:49.681
Oh, but I do. I really do.
I know him better than you.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:52.350
Look, we're moving in together
after graduation.

01:02:52.518 --> 01:02:54.311
Stan got into Georgetown?

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.730
- What?
- What?

01:02:56.898 --> 01:03:01.151
No. No. Stan got on the management track
at Home Depot.

01:03:01.319 --> 01:03:02.944
Oh, great.

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:06.990
And I'm going to Westwood Community
College to be closer to him.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.534
He's my forever.

01:03:12.288 --> 01:03:14.998
- There's no way in hell that's happening.
- Excuse me?

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:18.335
I said, "There's no way in hell
that that is happening. "

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.922
You think I'm gonna let you mortgage
your future?

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:24.466
You think I'll let you throw away
your hard work...

01:03:24.675 --> 01:03:26.843
...everything that you've accomplished...

01:03:27.011 --> 01:03:29.554
...for some psychopathic guy
who doesn't care about you?

01:03:29.722 --> 01:03:33.350
I forbid you. I forbid you
to see him anymore.

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:38.647
Oh, okay! Who the hell do you think
you are, my father?! Dude!

01:03:38.856 --> 01:03:41.149
- Don't walk away from me.
- You're a freak.

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:42.818
Margaret Sarah O'Donnell!

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:47.864
- Hey. How'd it go?
- Fantastic.

01:03:48.866 --> 01:03:50.575
What's on your leg?

01:03:51.244 --> 01:03:53.453
CHEERLEADERS
We're the Warriors! Yeah, yeah!

01:03:53.663 --> 01:03:55.789
Remember: Defense wins the game.

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:58.834
What's wrong? You look uncomfortable.

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:01.086
Oh. No.

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:05.632
I was just thinking that
the last time I was here...

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.134
...my husband asked me to marry him.

01:04:08.678 --> 01:04:10.011
Wow.

01:04:10.555 --> 01:04:12.347
Tough to compete with that.

01:04:14.058 --> 01:04:17.143
Down by 6, get the ball to Gold.

01:04:17.311 --> 01:04:19.938
Warriors on three. One, two, three.

01:04:20.106 --> 01:04:21.606
Warriors!

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.364
Stan, what are you doing? Let's go.

01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:32.576
Go, Alex! Whoo!

01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:33.910
Woo-hoo.

01:04:40.251 --> 01:04:41.626
Left side.

01:04:56.058 --> 01:04:58.059
Pick off! Right there!

01:05:01.147 --> 01:05:02.814
He's got too much time. Come on!

01:05:08.696 --> 01:05:10.238
Yeah!

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:15.660
Get it to McKinley! Get it in! Get it!

01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:17.329
Get him!

01:05:20.082 --> 01:05:24.336
Ball!

01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:26.171
Come on, outside!

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.967
O'Donnell! Give the ball to Gold!
Give the ball to Gold!

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:33.345
No, no, no!

01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:49.110
We did it! You were great. Oh.
Ooh. I, um...

01:05:49.946 --> 01:05:51.738
- I'm sweaty. Um...
- Sorry about that.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.657
Congratula... That was awesome.

01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:56.660
You did a great...
I saw the... I liked the dance.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:06:00.997
Yeah, so I think August...
August will be good.

01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:03.875
All right, uh, have a good night.

01:06:04.043 --> 01:06:05.377
See you tomorrow.

01:06:14.178 --> 01:06:18.056
Oh. Hi. Wow, what are the odds?

01:06:18.224 --> 01:06:21.351
What's it going to be now?
Did you buy me the Statue of Liberty?

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:24.938
I'm just going to ask you out, okay?
Like a grownup.

01:06:25.106 --> 01:06:26.606
Just two friends having dinner.

01:06:26.774 --> 01:06:32.028
Then if it turns into anything else,
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.906
No. Good night.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.701
I'll buy every student a laptop.

01:06:40.287 --> 01:06:43.039
You would deny the children of laptops?

01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:46.084
- Miss Masterson, the children.
- Okay. Okay, fine, fine.

01:06:46.711 --> 01:06:49.421
Fine. But this is not a date.

01:06:49.588 --> 01:06:50.755
No, in no way a date.

01:06:50.923 --> 01:06:54.592
And if I do this, you will stop
the inappropriate behavior and gifts.

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.846
- Yes.
- And we'll just drive to this restaurant.

01:06:58.014 --> 01:07:00.181
We won't fly there in the space shuttle...

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:03.935
...or drive in some gaudy, tacky limo.

01:07:04.103 --> 01:07:06.271
No, let's take your car. How about?

01:07:10.276 --> 01:07:11.568
This way.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:15.864
Ned to driver, abort.
Abort, abort. Move it out right now.

01:07:18.075 --> 01:07:22.412
I totally missed it. She came right up to me,
I should've kissed her. And I froze.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.123
Hey, don't worry.
I'll get you another chance.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.875
How? How are you going to do that?

01:07:32.339 --> 01:07:34.466
Victory party at my house!

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.898
Maggie.

01:08:00.284 --> 01:08:02.827
Maggie? Hey, Maggie.

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:04.454
Go away.

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:07.040
Hey, what happened?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.375
What do you want?

01:08:09.543 --> 01:08:12.170
Rub it in my face? Say, "I told you so"?

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:14.923
No. No, I really don't.

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:18.134
Just tell me what happened.

01:08:21.931 --> 01:08:23.681
Stan dumped me.

01:08:27.895 --> 01:08:30.105
Stan dumped you?

01:08:30.272 --> 01:08:32.065
Stan dumped you? What?

01:08:32.233 --> 01:08:35.860
What happened? How did this...?
What did he do?

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:37.612
What did he do?

01:08:38.239 --> 01:08:40.031
After the game...

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:41.991
We...

01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:45.203
He took me behind the quad, and we...

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:48.706
I can't hear this. You didn't.

01:08:48.874 --> 01:08:51.876
- No, Mags.
- No.

01:08:53.212 --> 01:08:55.004
No.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.299
That's why he dumped me.

01:09:02.638 --> 01:09:04.347
Mags, hey.

01:09:04.515 --> 01:09:07.058
Hey, hey, it's okay.

01:09:09.395 --> 01:09:10.895
You know...

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:15.984
...when you're young, everything feels like
the end of the world.

01:09:18.195 --> 01:09:19.946
It's not.

01:09:20.114 --> 01:09:21.906
Right.

01:09:22.408 --> 01:09:24.576
It's just the beginning.

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:28.663
You might have to meet
a few more jerks...

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:30.832
...but one day
you're going to meet a boy...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.002
...who treats you the way
that you deserve to be treated:

01:09:36.463 --> 01:09:39.340
Like the sun rises and sets with you.

01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:47.015
You really think so?

01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:51.102
I know so.

01:09:53.355 --> 01:09:54.939
That's so sweet.

01:09:55.774 --> 01:09:57.734
You're the sweetest.

01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:00.320
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

01:10:00.487 --> 01:10:01.696
- Ow. Oh.
- Thank you.

01:10:03.449 --> 01:10:07.702
Anyways, I, uh, came over here...
I was looking for you.

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:11.372
I wanted to invite you to my party.
I don't know if you want to come.

01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:13.458
- Yes. I would love to.
- Yeah.

01:10:13.626 --> 01:10:15.793
- Great. That's exciting.
- Thank you!

01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:17.754
- Aah! Yay!
- Yes. Yay.

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:19.505
- Thank you.
- That's very exciting.

01:10:19.673 --> 01:10:22.300
I know, it's great. Ha, ha.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:24.093
See you tonight.

01:10:32.603 --> 01:10:33.978
"At Mark's house. "

01:10:53.332 --> 01:10:57.001
Hey, that's cool. Let me see that.
That is nice, man.

01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:59.254
Don't touch the toys, okay?

01:11:00.339 --> 01:11:03.091
Yeah, I'll, uh, try not to light myself
on fire tonight.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:06.886
- I'll keep a fire extinguisher handy.
Oh, good.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:11.182
- Do you want to sit outside?
- Sure.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:46.968
That's delightful.

01:11:51.223 --> 01:11:53.516
What? What?

01:11:56.186 --> 01:11:59.731
- Okay, I don't know how to act normal.
- Clearly.

01:11:59.898 --> 01:12:04.569
It's the story of my life. I'm not smooth.
I'm just trying to impress you, okay?

01:12:04.737 --> 01:12:08.156
I'm not the kind of guy who comes
to places like this. I'm a dork.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.991
The kind of guy who spends 10 grand...

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.744
...on Gandalf the Grey's quarterstaff
from The Two Towers.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:16.414
Yes, that does make you a dork.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:22.670
Especially since Gandalf the Grey
was only in Fellowship.

01:12:24.381 --> 01:12:27.925
He returns in Two Towers
as Gandalf the White.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:54.535
I was upset. I'm sorry, okay?

01:12:54.703 --> 01:12:58.039
I need you to show me that you love me.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.166
And that way
we can get a place together.

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:03.461
Stop it. Look, whatever.
I'm with somebody else now.

01:13:04.129 --> 01:13:07.340
- What?
- Party's over, Stan.

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:09.634
Just get out of here.

01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:14.514
Oh, yeah?

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.308
Who's gonna make me leave?

01:13:18.852 --> 01:13:19.936
You?

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:23.981
You know I would, but it smells
like you've been drinking...

01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:27.068
...so I'm just gonna let the cops do it.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.741
You can have the nun.

01:13:34.368 --> 01:13:36.160
She doesn't put out, anyway.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:37.662
On second thought...

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:45.753
Oh, I just had the craziest dream.

01:13:47.714 --> 01:13:49.674
I was 17.

01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:54.637
I was back in high school,
and it was terrible.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.184
Scar.

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:04.772
Scar? I don't see a scar.

01:14:05.190 --> 01:14:08.192
Look, I know why you didn't
want me to be with Stan.

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.987
It's because you wanted me.

01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:16.826
You want to play games?
I can play games.

01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:19.412
- No, no, no.
- I'm a hungry lioness...

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.372
...and you're a baby gazelle.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.209
Maggie! No, no, no,
Maggie, stop this now.

01:14:25.377 --> 01:14:28.838
If you only knew how highly inappropriate
and dysfunctional this is.

01:14:29.381 --> 01:14:30.548
Stop it. Please stop.

01:14:30.716 --> 01:14:33.384
Maggie, I'm not the person
that you think I am.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:35.136
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

01:14:35.304 --> 01:14:37.930
You're right, you're good.
You're not like the others.

01:14:38.098 --> 01:14:40.766
I'm not like others.
I'm very different than the others.

01:14:40.934 --> 01:14:44.937
So different, in fact, that you and I can
never, ever, ever, ever be together.

01:14:45.105 --> 01:14:46.939
- Stop biting.
- Why?

01:14:50.319 --> 01:14:51.652
Oh.

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:55.781
Oh, my God. What are you saying?

01:14:55.949 --> 01:14:57.408
Are you confused?

01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:00.495
I'm very confused, yes.
Extremely confused.

01:15:00.662 --> 01:15:04.999
Oh, my God. I... I... I get it now.

01:15:05.417 --> 01:15:10.087
And your hair is always perfectly coiffed,
and you have highlights.

01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:14.383
- What are you talking about?
- I mean...

01:15:14.968 --> 01:15:17.929
Dude, your jeans are really tight.

01:15:20.265 --> 01:15:21.682
I'm not gay.

01:15:22.434 --> 01:15:24.810
I'm in love, Maggie. I'm in love.

01:15:25.229 --> 01:15:26.646
I've been in love.

01:15:26.813 --> 01:15:30.858
I've been in love with the same girl
since I was 17, Maggie.

01:15:32.736 --> 01:15:37.782
Does she go to our school? Do I know her?
Tell me her name. I want to know her name.

01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:40.076
- No, Maggie. No.
- Okay.

01:15:41.286 --> 01:15:46.207
You tell your girlfriend
she better keep a close eye on you.

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.464
Sweet baby Jesus.

01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.842
Thanks.

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:16.529
We'll take the check.

01:16:28.125 --> 01:16:29.709
I'm so dead.

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:35.381
Excuse me.

01:16:36.717 --> 01:16:39.343
- Scarlet? Scarlet? Scarlet.
- Hi.

01:16:39.511 --> 01:16:41.345
- What are you doing here?
- You seen Alex?

01:16:41.513 --> 01:16:43.472
He's not picking up his phone.

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.474
Alex is fine. Alex is fine, believe me.

01:16:45.642 --> 01:16:47.685
In fact, with the way things are going...

01:16:47.853 --> 01:16:51.188
...by the end of the night
Alex could have a girlfriend.

01:16:51.356 --> 01:16:54.650
- Alex has a girlfriend?
- Yeah, and she's great. She's cute.

01:16:54.818 --> 01:16:56.402
- Come on, I'll show you.
- Where?

01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:59.488
Walk up the stairs. Walk with me
for one sec, I'll show you.

01:16:59.656 --> 01:17:02.325
So how ever did you get
the newest version of Halo?

01:17:02.492 --> 01:17:04.744
It's not due out for another six months.

01:17:04.911 --> 01:17:10.124
Well, let's just say I said some things
to the Make-A-Wish people...

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.418
...that I'm not totally proud of.

01:17:23.180 --> 01:17:24.805
I'm going to kill him.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:43.324
Everybody, out!

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:51.040
Oh, no, no.
No! No! No! Not Dr. Philsopholis.

01:17:54.044 --> 01:17:55.878
This party is over!

01:17:56.046 --> 01:18:01.550
Unless you want to spend the next
three months in detention, leave! Now!

01:18:03.595 --> 01:18:06.180
Okay. We better go warn Mark.

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:11.936
You really care about him, don't you?

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:16.190
- Yeah.
- That's nice. That's really nice.

01:18:16.358 --> 01:18:19.110
He really needs a male role model.

01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:20.945
- He's a great kid.
- Mm-hm.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.073
You know, they both are.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.619
I think you're a great mother.

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:30.329
Thank you.

01:18:31.456 --> 01:18:33.332
He's on the balcony. He's right there.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:39.296
- Mom?
- This has been a really tough time...

01:18:39.464 --> 01:18:42.800
...and you really feel like
part of the family.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:47.471
You have no idea how amazing
it is to hear you say that.

01:18:57.691 --> 01:18:58.816
Scarlet.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:02.111
Scarlet! Scarlet, I'm not Mark, okay?

01:19:02.279 --> 01:19:06.031
- I'm him, I'm me. Scarlet, I'm your husband.
- Will you stop it already?

01:19:06.199 --> 01:19:09.493
If you'd listen to me, I am the father
of your children! Scar, let me...

01:19:09.661 --> 01:19:12.663
Don't call me that. Don't call me that!

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:15.583
You are a weirdo little man-child!

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.835
Give me two seconds,
and I can explain this!

01:19:18.003 --> 01:19:19.503
You are a pervert!

01:19:30.348 --> 01:19:33.601
Get out, and get out, and get out.

01:19:33.769 --> 01:19:35.311
You can leave.

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:42.193
Well, this isn't exactly the
inconspicuous relationship I wanted.

01:19:43.862 --> 01:19:46.864
I'm sure now you can see why
I don't date my students' parents.

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.201
I'm sorry.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:20:00.878
I'm sorry. I had no idea that it was
going to get so out of control.

01:20:01.463 --> 01:20:03.464
- Hm.
Really?

01:20:08.595 --> 01:20:11.555
- Now I'm sorry.
- I guess I deserved that.

01:20:11.973 --> 01:20:14.809
The second one was out of line.
It was uncalled for. Sorry.

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:17.228
Are you okay? I'm really sorry.

01:20:19.105 --> 01:20:21.899
Three makes it even. Now we're even.

01:20:24.444 --> 01:20:25.694
How are you? You okay?

01:20:25.862 --> 01:20:27.196
Yeah.

01:20:36.706 --> 01:20:39.458
And finished.

01:20:40.919 --> 01:20:43.254
With the rug area.

01:20:43.421 --> 01:20:45.756
But we've made very good progress.

01:20:46.716 --> 01:20:47.758
We deserve a break.

01:20:48.593 --> 01:20:50.469
I lost my family.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:52.930
Hey, Mike?

01:20:53.139 --> 01:20:56.767
If it's any consolation,
I think you really did help your kids.

01:20:57.143 --> 01:21:00.396
You did your job,
and now the hero can move on.

01:21:00.814 --> 01:21:02.606
I don't want to.

01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:06.277
Maybe they don't need me anymore,
but I need them.

01:21:08.154 --> 01:21:10.114
Hey, not to be a buzzkill...

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:11.866
...but you're due in court...

01:21:12.617 --> 01:21:14.285
...in 22 minutes.

01:21:15.287 --> 01:21:17.246
Ned, I need more time.

01:21:17.747 --> 01:21:20.249
- I have to stop this.
- To the Nedmobile.

01:21:20.584 --> 01:21:22.251
- Wait, Ned, Ned, Ned.
- Yes.

01:21:22.419 --> 01:21:26.255
- Pants.
- I should have pants on. Yes.

01:21:36.725 --> 01:21:38.225
Come on, Glenn!

01:21:38.935 --> 01:21:41.186
He's nothing but
a glorified midget wrangler.

01:21:41.479 --> 01:21:43.647
You wouldn't be so big
without that vest!

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:47.359
Grab that thing that's down there.
Grab it. Just hold that up.

01:21:47.527 --> 01:21:49.445
- Where you get this?
- Best 20 ever spent.

01:21:49.613 --> 01:21:51.488
Saves me a half hour on my commute.

01:21:51.656 --> 01:21:53.991
Dude, just hold it. Hold it way up.

01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:14.887
- The whole truth, nothing
but the truth, so help you God?

01:22:15.055 --> 01:22:16.347
I do.

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:18.849
You request a divorce
by the state of California...

01:22:19.017 --> 01:22:21.352
...citing irreconcilable differences.
This correct?

01:22:21.519 --> 01:22:25.439
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Is Michael O'Donnell present?

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:26.815
No, Your Honor.

01:22:26.983 --> 01:22:30.027
I take his absence as agreement
to the orders of the divorce.

01:22:34.532 --> 01:22:37.701
- You are not requesting sole custody?
- No, Your Honor.

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.287
"You can't handle the truth!"

01:22:41.539 --> 01:22:42.623
What?

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:46.001
I'm sorry, I panicked. It was the
first thing that came into my mind.

01:22:46.169 --> 01:22:48.796
Your Majesty.

01:22:49.172 --> 01:22:51.298
- Who are you?
- That's my husband's best friend.

01:22:52.634 --> 01:22:54.176
You a lawyer, best friend?

01:22:55.053 --> 01:22:56.553
- Yes.
- No.

01:22:56.721 --> 01:23:00.057
I believe the law degree
in my pocket says so.

01:23:00.225 --> 01:23:04.728
Yes, and it's a little bit smeared
because I sat on it in the car...

01:23:04.896 --> 01:23:08.190
...not because I printed it out recently.

01:23:11.486 --> 01:23:14.154
Let's pretend that's real.
Want to explain what you're doing?

01:23:15.031 --> 01:23:16.532
We...

01:23:17.492 --> 01:23:19.827
...are stopping a gross...

01:23:21.579 --> 01:23:23.080
...miscarriage ofjustice!

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:25.290
That...

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:29.044
Okay, if you'd just let me explain.
I can explain this.

01:23:29.212 --> 01:23:30.587
If you would just listen...

01:23:30.755 --> 01:23:34.633
I've got a letter from Mike O'Donnell,
he's the husband in this case!

01:23:34.801 --> 01:23:36.301
I'm sorry. We're in the middle...

01:23:36.469 --> 01:23:39.888
Your Honor, if it's okay,
I'd like to hear the letter, please.

01:23:47.564 --> 01:23:49.231
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:54.153
This is a letter from Mike O'Donnell.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:56.280
He wanted me to read it.

01:23:59.659 --> 01:24:01.201
"Scarlet...

01:24:03.079 --> 01:24:05.247
...before you go through with this...

01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:09.710
...I want to remind you
of September 7th, 1988.

01:24:12.088 --> 01:24:13.922
It was the first time that I saw you.

01:24:16.426 --> 01:24:18.552
You were reading Less Than Zero.

01:24:19.262 --> 01:24:22.931
You were wearing
a Guns N' Roses T-shirt.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.978
I'd never seen anything so perfect.

01:24:31.775 --> 01:24:34.943
I remember thinking
that I had to have you, or I'd die.

01:24:38.281 --> 01:24:39.990
Then you whispered that you loved me...

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:44.995
...at the homecoming dance.

01:24:48.666 --> 01:24:50.167
And I felt...

01:24:51.002 --> 01:24:52.753
...so peaceful...

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:56.465
...and safe.

01:24:58.635 --> 01:25:01.720
Because I knew that no matter
what happened from that day on...

01:25:01.888 --> 01:25:04.389
...nothing could ever be that bad.

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:06.975
Because I had you.

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:10.270
Uh...

01:25:11.022 --> 01:25:12.564
And then I grew up...

01:25:14.192 --> 01:25:16.026
...and I lost my way.

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:21.615
And I blamed you for my failures.

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:29.039
And I know that you think
you have to do this today.

01:25:31.042 --> 01:25:32.876
I don't want you to.

01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:39.383
But I guess...

01:25:43.054 --> 01:25:44.721
...if I love you...

01:25:48.351 --> 01:25:50.519
...I should let you move on. "

01:25:54.732 --> 01:25:56.358
All right, son, you need to go now.

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:20.382
Let's proceed.

01:26:23.094 --> 01:26:25.262
I'm sorry, Your Honor.
Would it be okay...

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:28.390
...if we postpone
this for now for just a little while?

01:26:28.558 --> 01:26:30.225
Would that be okay?

01:26:31.144 --> 01:26:32.895
Postponed 30 days. Next case.

01:26:59.672 --> 01:27:01.965
Haven't seen you practice
this hard since school.

01:27:02.133 --> 01:27:05.177
Yeah, you know, if I want
to impress these college scouts...

01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:07.763
...then I need to stay focused.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:11.433
Wait, wait. You're not still trying
to get a scholarship, are you?

01:27:12.018 --> 01:27:15.979
Be careful, man. You do not want
to get off of the spirit path.

01:27:16.147 --> 01:27:20.609
There's no path, Ned! There's no path!
I can't do it!

01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:22.527
I just made it worse for them.

01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:27.491
My wife is happier, everyone's happier
with me out of the picture, Ned.

01:27:28.201 --> 01:27:29.952
It's time to move on.

01:28:02.360 --> 01:28:04.111
It's time to go, Mom.

01:28:18.209 --> 01:28:21.044
Hey, Gold, save something
for the game, huh?

01:28:21.212 --> 01:28:23.130
Just warming up, coach.

01:28:23.298 --> 01:28:25.549
Got a little inside info for you.

01:28:25.717 --> 01:28:29.261
The scout from Ohio State is back,
and the coach is with him.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:32.139
You play half the game
I know you're capable of...

01:28:32.307 --> 01:28:34.975
...you're going to be playing
college ball next year, huh?

01:28:35.143 --> 01:28:37.144
- That's the plan, coach.
- Give me the ball.

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:43.025
All right, gather up, jockstraps.
Picture time.

01:28:43.192 --> 01:28:45.068
Try not to break the camera.

01:29:30.448 --> 01:29:33.950
I can't wait to go to Georgetown
and start dating college boys.

01:29:38.790 --> 01:29:42.417
I thought Mark was hanging out
with Alex to get to me, not you.

01:29:43.461 --> 01:29:46.004
All right, ladies, let's bring it in.

01:29:48.257 --> 01:29:50.801
Jane! Jane!

01:29:51.636 --> 01:29:54.471
Jane! I'm sorry, sorry.

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.640
Ned, Ned, Ned.
- Oh, sorry.

01:29:56.808 --> 01:29:59.559
Ned. Yeah. Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:00.812 --> 01:30:02.938
- I need to talk to you.
- What are you doing?

01:30:03.106 --> 01:30:05.107
I practiced this, uh.

01:30:05.274 --> 01:30:06.775
Okay.

01:30:06.943 --> 01:30:13.448
I have just seen my best friend lose
everything than means anything to him.

01:30:13.616 --> 01:30:15.367
And maybe we'll never be there, but...

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:20.330
Yes, I understand, but I have told you
before that I am the principal...

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:22.958
- Yes.
... and I cannot be seen...

01:30:23.126 --> 01:30:24.626
...with my students' parents.

01:30:24.794 --> 01:30:28.004
But, Jane,
how can you be seen with me...

01:30:28.172 --> 01:30:30.799
...when I'm wearing
the cloak of invisibility?

01:30:33.302 --> 01:30:37.431
Jane, all I'm asking is a chance
for us to be friends.

01:30:38.516 --> 01:30:41.435
Because you're the one
I want by my side...

01:30:41.602 --> 01:30:44.938
...when I'm storming
the Elvish Castle of Ganakinesh.

01:30:50.820 --> 01:30:52.946
You can plunder my dungeon anytime.

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:55.031
I'll bring my long bow.

01:30:55.950 --> 01:30:58.660
Warriors! Yeah!

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:03.206
Come on.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:18.722
Oh, my God.

01:31:18.890 --> 01:31:20.891
Mom? Are you okay?

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:25.520
I can't be here again. I have to go.

01:31:46.209 --> 01:31:48.543
The game. That's your future.
The baby's my future.

01:31:49.504 --> 01:31:52.714
That's crazy, Mike.
No, I can't let you throw this all away.

01:31:52.882 --> 01:31:54.216
Bye, Mike.

01:31:54.383 --> 01:31:55.842
High school star.
Never lived up to potential.

01:31:56.010 --> 01:31:58.512
- What are you doing?
I want to live in the past.

01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:01.723
I'll bet you wish you had it to
do all over again.

01:32:01.891 --> 01:32:03.183
Hello?!

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:05.101
It's a classic transformation story.

01:32:05.978 --> 01:32:08.104
Spirit guide?

01:32:08.439 --> 01:32:10.524
You and me, we're in this together.

01:32:13.444 --> 01:32:14.528
It's your turn now.

01:32:22.286 --> 01:32:23.286
Traveling.

01:32:23.454 --> 01:32:24.955
Green ball!

01:32:25.289 --> 01:32:27.290
O'Donnell, get in there!

01:32:27.458 --> 01:32:28.875
Scarlet!

01:32:30.253 --> 01:32:31.628
Scar?

01:32:33.256 --> 01:32:34.798
Scarlet?

01:32:53.109 --> 01:32:54.693
It is you.

01:33:01.576 --> 01:33:02.701
Hi.

01:33:04.328 --> 01:33:05.620
"Hi"?

01:33:07.331 --> 01:33:08.456
I can explain.

01:33:10.459 --> 01:33:11.835
You can?

01:33:12.003 --> 01:33:13.920
No, not at all.

01:33:15.506 --> 01:33:19.384
- You didn't have to come after me again.
- Yes, I did, because I love you.

01:33:20.177 --> 01:33:23.305
You're the best decision
I ever made, I just forgot.

01:33:24.765 --> 01:33:29.311
And then I fell off a bridge
and things got pretty weird after that.

01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:31.730
But I'm never going to forget again.

01:33:33.316 --> 01:33:37.027
Look, I know that I've been
in a bad mood for the last...

01:33:37.653 --> 01:33:39.154
...20 years.

01:33:40.197 --> 01:33:44.659
But if you let me, I swear, I will spend
the rest of my life making it up to you.

01:33:46.037 --> 01:33:48.705
I thought I wanted
a second chance at life...

01:33:48.873 --> 01:33:52.417
...but now I know I just want
a second chance with y...

01:33:56.130 --> 01:33:57.505
Weird.

01:33:57.882 --> 01:33:59.215
Yeah.

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:02.677
I missed you.

01:34:09.727 --> 01:34:14.689
Yeah, I'm gonna put you down
because this was a lot easier before.

01:34:15.358 --> 01:34:18.818
Yeah, you did have that six-pack
thing going.

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:20.862
Is there any chance I'll see that again?

01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:23.698
I knew you were checking me out.

01:34:26.243 --> 01:34:29.537
Go! Go! Go!

01:34:32.375 --> 01:34:34.542
Adults can have that, though.

01:34:34.710 --> 01:34:37.545
Well, I'll work on it. Maybe I'll jog home.

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.054
Ned, hey.

01:34:46.222 --> 01:34:49.683
I packed up all my stuff and I wanted
to give your key back and say thanks.

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:51.309
Hey, whoa. No. No.

01:34:51.477 --> 01:34:54.854
Wasn't expecting to see
you there, Principal Masterson.

01:34:55.064 --> 01:34:57.148
You look very pretty.

01:34:57.316 --> 01:34:58.358
Thank you.

01:34:58.526 --> 01:35:00.110
The Force is strong in this one.

01:35:00.277 --> 01:35:02.821
So I guess I'll be
seeing you at work, boss.

01:35:02.988 --> 01:35:05.532
Oh, yes, uh, Coach O'Donnell.

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.910
And, um, we are very happy
to have you aboard.

01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:12.872
Buddy, I got you a little something
for your first day at your new job.

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.917
Don't think about how much it cost,
it's not much.

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:20.046
Hey, you got me a whistle.

01:35:21.465 --> 01:35:22.632
Don't blow it.

01:35:25.344 --> 01:35:26.386
Play big.

01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:28.263
You too.

01:35:29.932 --> 01:35:31.641
Good luck.
Love you!

01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:33.309
Love you!
