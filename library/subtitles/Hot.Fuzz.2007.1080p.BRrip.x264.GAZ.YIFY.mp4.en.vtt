Attended Hendon College of Police Training.

00:01:18.336 --> 00:01:21.006
Displayed great aptitude in field exercises.

00:01:23.467 --> 00:01:26.178
Notably, urban pacification and riot control.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.846
Back off!

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.184
Academically excelled in theoretical
course work and final year examinations.

00:01:32.601 --> 00:01:34.603
Received the Baton of Honor.

00:01:34.686 --> 00:01:38.732
Graduated with distinction into
the Metropolitan Police Service.

00:01:39.191 --> 00:01:42.861
Quickly established an effectiveness
and popularity within the community.

00:01:43.236 --> 00:01:44.404
Use your brain.

00:01:44.821 --> 00:01:47.866
Proceeded to improve skill base
with courses in advanced driving

00:01:49.618 --> 00:01:51.912
and advanced cycling.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:56.708
Became heavily involved
in a number of extra vocational activities.

00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:59.794
To this day holds the Met record
for the 100 meter dash.

00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:05.759
In 2001 began active duty with
the renowned SO 19 armed response unit.

00:02:05.884 --> 00:02:10.222
Received a bravery award for efforts
in the resolution of Operation Crackdown.

00:02:10.722 --> 00:02:14.267
In the last 12 months
has received nine special commendations.

00:02:14.476 --> 00:02:17.521
Achieved the highest arrest record
for any officer in the Met.

00:02:17.604 --> 00:02:20.190
And sustained three injuries
in the line of duty.

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:25.111
Most recently in December when wounded
by a man dressed as Father Christmas.

00:02:31.952 --> 00:02:32.994
- Hello, Nicholas.
- Hello, Sergeant.

00:02:33.036 --> 00:02:34.037
- How's the hand?
- Still a bit stiff.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.080
It can get awfully hairy out there.

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:39.459
I'm surprised you weren't snapped up
sooner for a nice desk job. That's what I did.

00:02:39.543 --> 00:02:41.837
I prefer to think my office is
out on the street.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.463
Indeed, you do.

00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:48.218
Your arrest record is 400% higher
than any other officer.

00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:52.931
Which is why it's high time
that such skills were put to better use.

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.269
- We're making you Sergeant.
- I see.

00:02:58.061 --> 00:02:59.855
In Sandford, Gloucestershire.

00:02:59.938 --> 00:03:02.607
- In where, sorry?
- In Sandford, Gloucestershire.

00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:05.777
- That's in the country.
- Yes, lovely.

00:03:06.611 --> 00:03:08.446
Isn't there a Sergeant's position
here in London?

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.739
No.

00:03:09.823 --> 00:03:12.117
- Can I remain here as a PC?
- No.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.619
- Do I have any choice in this?
- No.

00:03:15.704 --> 00:03:17.455
Sergeant, I kind of like it here.

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:19.666
Well, you've always wanted
to transfer to the country.

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:22.460
- In 20 years or so, yes.
- Well done, you.

00:03:22.961 --> 00:03:24.671
Hang on, I don't remember telling you that.

00:03:24.754 --> 00:03:26.840
Yes, you did. You said,

00:03:26.923 --> 00:03:29.926
"I'd love to settle down
in the country sometime, Janine."

00:03:31.303 --> 00:03:32.971
I'd like to talk to the Inspector.

00:03:33.054 --> 00:03:35.015
You can speak to the Inspector,
but I can promise you

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:38.059
he will tell you
exactly the same thing as I have.

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.231
- Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
- It's still a bit stiff.

00:03:43.315 --> 00:03:45.734
- And how are things at home?
- I'm sorry, sir?

00:03:45.817 --> 00:03:47.319
How's Janine?

00:03:48.987 --> 00:03:50.780
We're no longer together, sir.

00:03:50.864 --> 00:03:53.783
- Right. Then where are you living?
- He's staying at the Section House, sir.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.828
- With the recruits?
- Yes, he's living out of cardboard boxes.

00:03:56.912 --> 00:03:58.788
Well, then, you're packed already.

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:01.833
Nicholas, we're offering you a smashing
position with a delightful cottage,

00:04:01.917 --> 00:04:05.337
in a lovely little place
that I think has won Village of the Year

00:04:05.378 --> 00:04:08.757
I don't know how many times.
It'll be good for you.

00:04:08.965 --> 00:04:12.427
- I don't really know what to say.
- Yes?

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.304
Yes, thank you.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.683
No, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to...

00:04:18.767 --> 00:04:21.686
- You want to take this higher?
- Yes, yes, I do.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.688
You want me to bother
the Chief Inspector with this?

00:04:23.772 --> 00:04:24.856
Yes.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.984
You want me to get the Chief Inspector
to come all the way down here?

00:04:28.068 --> 00:04:30.654
- Yes, I do.
- Okay.

00:04:31.571 --> 00:04:32.781
Kenneth!

00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:36.618
- Hello, Nicholas. How's the hand?
- Still a bit stiff.

00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:38.662
- Chief Inspector...
- Keep your seat.

00:04:38.745 --> 00:04:40.956
Now, I know what you're going to say,

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.334
but the fact is,
you've been making us all look bad.

00:04:44.417 --> 00:04:45.502
I'm sorry, sir?

00:04:45.585 --> 00:04:47.045
Of course we all appreciate your efforts,

00:04:47.128 --> 00:04:49.714
but you've been rather
letting the side down.

00:04:49.798 --> 00:04:51.758
It's all about being a team player, Nicholas.

00:04:51.842 --> 00:04:53.844
You can't be the Sheriff of London.

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:55.720
If we let you carry on running round town,

00:04:55.804 --> 00:04:59.641
you'll continue to be exceptional
and we can't have that.

00:04:59.724 --> 00:05:02.102
You'll put us all out of a job.

00:05:02.477 --> 00:05:04.187
With respect, sir.

00:05:04.271 --> 00:05:09.609
- You can't just make people disappear.
- Yes, I can. I'm the Chief Inspector.

00:05:10.318 --> 00:05:14.906
Well, however you spin this, there's
one thing you haven't taken into account.

00:05:15.031 --> 00:05:17.534
And that's what the "team"
is gonna make of this.

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:35.051
- Hello?
- Janine, it's me.

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:37.179
I know. I'm at work.

00:05:37.262 --> 00:05:39.181
I know, I'm outside.

00:05:40.974 --> 00:05:42.726
What's the situation?

00:05:42.809 --> 00:05:45.896
You know the situation.
We've been over this.

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.397
No, I... I meant here.

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:50.108
Two people involved,
distinct signs of a struggle.

00:05:50.192 --> 00:05:51.401
Complete mess.

00:05:51.485 --> 00:05:54.571
- You are talking about here?
- Nicholas, what do you want?

00:05:54.654 --> 00:05:58.825
Well, I have something important to tell you
and I didn't wanna do it over the phone.

00:06:00.994 --> 00:06:03.830
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:05.081
I'm not Janine.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.044
Janine, I've been transferred.
I'm moving away for a while.

00:06:09.127 --> 00:06:10.879
I know. Bob told me.

00:06:10.962 --> 00:06:12.130
Hello, there.

00:06:12.214 --> 00:06:14.299
Well, I wanted to tell you in person.

00:06:14.382 --> 00:06:16.510
And there's no reason
we can't be civil with each other.

00:06:16.593 --> 00:06:18.428
It's not that long ago
we were talking about getting married.

00:06:18.512 --> 00:06:21.431
Yes, but you were already married
to the force, weren't you?

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.308
We're actually supposed to call it
"the service" now.

00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:26.102
Official vocab guidelines state
that "force" is too aggressive.

00:06:26.186 --> 00:06:27.979
See. It's only ever about the job.

00:06:28.063 --> 00:06:30.273
- It's all you care about.
- That's not true.

00:06:30.357 --> 00:06:33.276
No, you're right,
you do have that rubber plant.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.113
- It's a Japanese Peace Lily.
- You just can't switch off, Nicholas.

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:43.036
And until you find a person you care
about more than your job, you never will.

00:06:43.954 --> 00:06:47.082
Besides, you were the one
who suggested we take a break.

00:06:47.165 --> 00:06:51.169
Yes, well,
guilty people often make the first move.

00:06:52.337 --> 00:06:54.381
Actually, there's something
I need to tell you.

00:06:54.464 --> 00:06:56.925
- You're seeing someone else.
- Yes. How did you...

00:06:57.008 --> 00:06:59.010
- Is it Bob?
- No.

00:06:59.094 --> 00:07:02.597
Does Bob look like
the kind of person I'd go out with?

00:07:02.681 --> 00:07:04.182
It's Dave.

00:07:04.266 --> 00:07:05.725
Hello, there.

00:07:06.643 --> 00:07:08.103
I see.

00:07:09.146 --> 00:07:10.647
Oh, Nicholas.

00:07:10.897 --> 00:07:13.525
You do realize that window
was broken from the inside?

00:07:21.408 --> 00:07:22.868
Hello there, Nicholas,
Frank Butterman here, your new Inspector.

00:07:22.951 --> 00:07:26.163
I'm just calling with details
of your accommodation.

00:07:26.246 --> 00:07:29.332
We've got you a lovely little cottage
on Spencer Hill.

00:07:29.916 --> 00:07:32.335
Look forward to meeting you anon. Cheerio.

00:07:33.503 --> 00:07:36.631
Nicholas, Frank again.
One other thing about your cottage.

00:07:36.965 --> 00:07:38.091
It's not ready.

00:08:19.591 --> 00:08:23.261
It would appear the heavens have opened.

00:08:30.352 --> 00:08:34.356
- I was hoping to check in.
- Check in?

00:08:34.856 --> 00:08:37.192
But you've always been here.

00:08:37.567 --> 00:08:41.530
- Excuse me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08:41.613 --> 00:08:43.365
I thought you were my husband.

00:08:43.448 --> 00:08:46.159
- You must be Sergeant Angel.
- Yes, I am.

00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:49.538
I'm Joyce Cooper.
I trust you had a pleasant trip. Fascist.

00:08:50.038 --> 00:08:51.373
I beg your pardon?

00:08:51.456 --> 00:08:56.711
"System of Government characterized
by extreme dictatorship." Seven across.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.716
- Oh, I see. It's "fascism."
- Fascism. Wonderful.

00:09:01.967 --> 00:09:06.388
Now, we've put you in the Castle Suite.
Bernard will escort you up there.

00:09:07.722 --> 00:09:11.768
Well, actually,
I could probably make my own way up. Hag.

00:09:12.227 --> 00:09:14.020
I beg your pardon?

00:09:14.104 --> 00:09:17.899
"Evil old woman considered
frightful or ugly." It's 12 down.

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.652
Oh, bless you.

00:10:06.156 --> 00:10:09.784
- Pint of lager, please, Mary.
- Right you are, my love.

00:10:10.285 --> 00:10:12.037
Yes, sir, what can I get you?

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:17.042
Could I have a glass
of the cranberry juice, please?

00:10:17.125 --> 00:10:18.418
Certainly.

00:10:18.502 --> 00:10:21.963
Now, you wouldn't, by any chance,
be the new policeman?

00:10:22.047 --> 00:10:24.090
Police officer, yes. I'm Nicholas Angel.

00:10:24.174 --> 00:10:27.052
- I'm Roy Porter. This is my wife Mary.
- Mary.

00:10:27.594 --> 00:10:28.845
Welcome to Sandford.

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:30.430
If there's anything you need,
just let us know.

00:10:30.514 --> 00:10:33.809
Thank you. Could I borrow your newspaper?

00:10:33.892 --> 00:10:35.143
It's not ours, love.

00:10:35.227 --> 00:10:37.813
We're not big fans of the local fish wrapper,
are we, Mare?

00:10:37.896 --> 00:10:41.483
- They listed her age as 55.
- When I'm actually 53.

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:42.818
Fifty-three.

00:10:44.277 --> 00:10:47.614
- Pint of lager, please, Mary.
- Right you are, my love.

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:22.524
- Excuse me.
- What?

00:11:22.607 --> 00:11:25.026
- When's your birthday?
- Twenty-second of February.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.112
- What year?
- Every year.

00:11:27.195 --> 00:11:28.321
Get out.

00:11:29.489 --> 00:11:34.703
- When's your birthday?
- Eighth of May, 1969.

00:11:34.786 --> 00:11:36.580
- You're 37?
- Yeah.

00:11:36.663 --> 00:11:37.789
Get out.

00:11:37.873 --> 00:11:38.999
When's your birthday?

00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:41.376
Out.

00:11:41.877 --> 00:11:45.046
- Is there a problem, Officer?
- Yes, there is, Mr. Porter.

00:11:45.130 --> 00:11:47.924
It would appear a number
of your patrons are under age.

00:11:48.008 --> 00:11:50.719
Well, a few of them may be
a month or two south of proper.

00:11:50.802 --> 00:11:53.555
But if they're in here,
it stops them getting into trouble out there.

00:11:53.638 --> 00:11:55.891
Yeah, the way we see it,
it's all for the greater good.

00:11:55.974 --> 00:11:57.100
The greater good.

00:11:57.184 --> 00:12:01.480
Well, that's as may be,
but the law's the law and they'll have to go.

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.571
- Another cranberry juice?
- I'm fine, thank you.

00:12:31.051 --> 00:12:33.970
I hope you're not planning on driving that.

00:12:34.179 --> 00:12:35.305
No.

00:12:51.154 --> 00:12:54.157
Right. I'm taking you to the station.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.077
Where is it?

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:05.001
What?

00:13:15.595 --> 00:13:16.763
Move.

00:13:21.351 --> 00:13:23.562
"Nicholas Angel."

00:13:24.187 --> 00:13:27.190
- Oh, when did you start?
- Tomorrow.

00:13:27.649 --> 00:13:30.068
Well, I see you've already arrested
the whole village.

00:13:30.152 --> 00:13:31.319
Not exactly.

00:13:32.154 --> 00:13:35.073
- You in for the night?
- Go on, four's free.

00:13:35.157 --> 00:13:38.535
- Hey, now, I need to speak to him.
- He'll be no use till the morning.

00:13:38.618 --> 00:13:39.786
I see.

00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:42.873
You really want to process all this lot?

00:13:43.748 --> 00:13:46.293
- My pen's running out.
- Not a problem.

00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:27.042
- Morning, Sergeant.
- Morning.

00:14:27.125 --> 00:14:28.293
Morning.

00:14:29.336 --> 00:14:30.504
Morning, Sergeant.

00:14:32.589 --> 00:14:34.466
Morning, Sergeant.

00:14:39.513 --> 00:14:41.723
- Lock me up.
- I'm sorry?

00:14:41.807 --> 00:14:43.934
I'm a slasher and I must be stopped.

00:14:44.810 --> 00:14:48.480
- You're a what?
- A slasher of prices.

00:14:49.981 --> 00:14:54.778
Just kidding. I'm Simon Skinner.
I run the local supermarch .

00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:58.490
Drop in and see me sometime.
My discounts are criminal.

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:00.492
Catch me later!

00:15:02.494 --> 00:15:04.788
Morning, Sergeant.

00:15:10.293 --> 00:15:12.420
Morning, Sergeant.

00:15:16.049 --> 00:15:19.261
Could you tell the Inspector
I've arrived, please?

00:15:19.553 --> 00:15:20.887
No.

00:15:21.471 --> 00:15:22.722
Why?

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:25.142
He's not in yet.

00:15:25.433 --> 00:15:27.894
- Well, how's our guest?
- Guest?

00:15:27.978 --> 00:15:32.607
- The inebriate in cell four.
- I don't know. Nobody tells me nothing.

00:15:38.071 --> 00:15:39.906
Can I get cell four open, please?

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.075
Danny, can you open four?

00:15:44.619 --> 00:15:49.082
- He's gone.
- Oh, my God. Who's gone?

00:15:52.085 --> 00:15:56.256
- Why are you dressed like a police officer?
- Because I am one.

00:15:57.132 --> 00:15:59.551
Sergeant Angel, at last. Frank Butterman.

00:16:00.719 --> 00:16:03.805
- I see you've already met my boy.
- Yes.

00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:09.060
Do forgive me.
I'm something of a Wild West nut.

00:16:09.144 --> 00:16:13.482
Speaking of which, that was a fair
few outlaws you rounded up last night.

00:16:13.648 --> 00:16:15.233
Thank you, sir.

00:16:15.317 --> 00:16:20.238
I admire your enthusiasm
and far be it from me to stifle your flair,

00:16:20.322 --> 00:16:23.033
but this isn't London.
Oh, yes, please, Danny.

00:16:23.116 --> 00:16:24.242
With respect, sir,

00:16:24.326 --> 00:16:27.579
geographical location shouldn't factor
in the application of the law.

00:16:27.662 --> 00:16:28.955
No, thanks.

00:16:29.039 --> 00:16:32.959
Statistically, Sandford is
the safest village in the country.

00:16:33.043 --> 00:16:35.253
But that doesn't mean
it requires anything less

00:16:35.337 --> 00:16:37.798
than a careful and considered approach.

00:16:37.881 --> 00:16:40.801
There's a reason we accommodate
a few of the younglings at the pub.

00:16:40.884 --> 00:16:44.387
- The greater good?
- The greater good. Precisely.

00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:48.767
Your predecessor assumed
that rural policing was easy.

00:16:49.601 --> 00:16:51.603
Ended up having a nervous breakdown.

00:16:51.686 --> 00:16:55.816
And Sergeant Popwell was
an exceptional officer, truly exceptional.

00:16:56.608 --> 00:16:58.610
And he had one thing you haven't got.

00:16:58.693 --> 00:17:01.613
- What's that, sir?
- A great big bushy beard.

00:17:01.696 --> 00:17:03.782
Come on, let's have a mosey around.

00:17:06.076 --> 00:17:07.452
Locker room.

00:17:08.829 --> 00:17:10.330
Riot room.

00:17:12.541 --> 00:17:14.000
Evidence room.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.007
Now, how about a trip to the Andes?

00:17:21.091 --> 00:17:24.928
Detective Sergeant Wainwright
and Detective Constable Cartwright.

00:17:26.388 --> 00:17:27.931
Don't get up.

00:17:29.141 --> 00:17:31.810
I expect you're wondering
why we call them the Andes.

00:17:31.893 --> 00:17:35.564
- They're both called Andrew?
- They said you were good.

00:17:35.647 --> 00:17:38.316
Also, because talking to them is
an uphill struggle, isn't it, Dad?

00:17:38.733 --> 00:17:40.735
- Fuck off!
- Thank you, Danny.

00:17:46.825 --> 00:17:49.911
And this is where it all happens.

00:17:51.413 --> 00:17:53.582
That is Sergeant Tony Fisher.

00:17:53.665 --> 00:17:54.958
PC Bob Walker.

00:17:56.418 --> 00:17:57.752
And that is Saxon.

00:17:58.295 --> 00:18:02.507
And this is one Doris Thatcher.

00:18:02.591 --> 00:18:04.676
- She's our only policewoman.
- She's not a policewoman.

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:06.970
- Yeah, she is. I've seen her bra.
- She's a police officer.

00:18:07.053 --> 00:18:08.513
Being a woman has nothing to do with it.

00:18:08.597 --> 00:18:10.682
Oh, I don't know.
Comes in handy every so often.

00:18:11.016 --> 00:18:14.519
I could've given you the tour.
I've been round the station a few times.

00:18:14.811 --> 00:18:16.313
And what's upstairs?

00:18:18.064 --> 00:18:20.650
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

00:18:20.734 --> 00:18:23.028
Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.

00:18:23.403 --> 00:18:26.823
Civilian liaison
with the Neighborhood Watch Alliance.

00:18:26.907 --> 00:18:30.035
You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.

00:18:31.495 --> 00:18:36.791
From this command center
I can see what the whole village is up to.

00:18:37.959 --> 00:18:41.421
I must say I was rather admiring
your handiwork last night.

00:18:41.505 --> 00:18:44.090
It's a pity you didn't do the same
to those bloody hoodies.

00:18:44.174 --> 00:18:46.802
Hanging around. Loitering. Sitting.

00:18:46.885 --> 00:18:49.304
Actually, I did notice some minor graffiti
on the fountain.

00:18:49.387 --> 00:18:51.723
Graffiti? They've gotta be dealt with, Frank.

00:18:51.807 --> 00:18:54.059
They're nippers, Tom. They'll come round.

00:18:54.142 --> 00:18:55.393
Which reminds me,

00:18:55.477 --> 00:18:58.814
our friend, The Living Statue,
was here on Saturday.

00:18:58.897 --> 00:19:03.944
11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00.

00:19:04.027 --> 00:19:06.863
If we don't come down hard
on these clowns,

00:19:06.947 --> 00:19:11.201
- we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers.
- We'll get right onto it, Tom.

00:19:13.495 --> 00:19:15.872
We like to let them think they run the place.

00:19:15.956 --> 00:19:17.707
Well, that's that.

00:19:17.791 --> 00:19:20.210
Unless there's anything
you're unclear about?

00:19:20.293 --> 00:19:23.505
Yes, sir.
Why is everybody eating chocolate cake?

00:19:23.588 --> 00:19:27.843
The Black Forest gateau is on Danny.
As punishment for his little indiscretion.

00:19:27.926 --> 00:19:29.010
His...

00:19:29.094 --> 00:19:32.430
Sir, I don't think driving under the influence
can be called a "little indiscretion."

00:19:32.514 --> 00:19:35.684
No, the gateau is for misplacing
his helmet the other week.

00:19:35.767 --> 00:19:39.729
Last night's incident will require
something rather more serious.

00:19:39.813 --> 00:19:42.107
- Good.
- Do you like ice-cream?

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.942
I'm sorry, sir, I don't follow.

00:19:44.025 --> 00:19:47.779
Let's just say that we won't be short
of Chunky Monkey for the next month.

00:19:48.446 --> 00:19:49.614
Dad.

00:19:49.698 --> 00:19:53.493
Now, since it's your first day
and it's 11:30, I'd say that's lunch.

00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:04.421
So, what made you choose Sandford then,
Sergeant Angel?

00:20:04.504 --> 00:20:06.131
It wasn't actually my choice.

00:20:06.214 --> 00:20:10.385
Oh, right, right, wasn't your choice to come
down here and tell me how to do my job.

00:20:10.469 --> 00:20:11.678
Our jobs.

00:20:13.722 --> 00:20:14.806
Yeah.

00:20:15.765 --> 00:20:18.685
Look, I can assure you it wasn't
my intention to upset the apple cart.

00:20:18.768 --> 00:20:22.022
Yeah, 'cause we all sell apples round here,
don't we?

00:20:22.105 --> 00:20:24.941
- Your dad sells apples, Andy.
- And raspberries.

00:20:25.025 --> 00:20:27.611
I bet you can't wait to jump
into Sergeant Popwell's grave.

00:20:27.694 --> 00:20:29.863
I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.

00:20:31.156 --> 00:20:34.493
- You got a mustache.
- I know.

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:38.330
- Why have you got your stab vest on?
- It's a requirement.

00:20:38.413 --> 00:20:42.667
In the city maybe.
Nobody's gonna stab you in here, Sergeant.

00:20:42.959 --> 00:20:44.961
Not a member of the public anyhow.

00:20:47.047 --> 00:20:49.800
- Have you been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher?
- No.

00:20:49.883 --> 00:20:51.301
Well, I have.

00:20:51.384 --> 00:20:53.970
And I can assure you
it is not in the least bit amusing.

00:20:55.639 --> 00:20:58.183
Have you seen a lot of action,
Sergeant Angel?

00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:00.185
I've experienced my fair share, yes.

00:21:00.268 --> 00:21:02.771
- Did you cook any fools?
- Excuse me?

00:21:02.854 --> 00:21:04.105
Did you shoot anybody?

00:21:04.189 --> 00:21:07.526
He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.

00:21:08.068 --> 00:21:11.822
- Where did you get that?
- The offender had the Kalashnikov.

00:21:11.905 --> 00:21:12.989
Where'd he get that?

00:21:13.073 --> 00:21:16.284
You do know there are more guns
in the country than there are in the city?

00:21:16.368 --> 00:21:19.412
Everybody and their mums
is packing round here.

00:21:20.163 --> 00:21:22.207
- Like who?
- Farmers.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.793
- Who else?
- Farmers's mums.

00:21:29.089 --> 00:21:31.883
What's it like being stabbed?

00:21:32.509 --> 00:21:35.846
It was the single most painful
experience of my life.

00:21:35.929 --> 00:21:38.306
What was the second most painful?

00:21:44.771 --> 00:21:45.814
You ever fired two guns
whilst jumping through the air?

00:21:45.856 --> 00:21:46.857
No.

00:21:46.898 --> 00:21:47.899
You ever fired one gun
whilst jumping through the air?

00:21:47.941 --> 00:21:48.942
No.

00:21:48.984 --> 00:21:49.985
- Ever been in a high speed pursuit?
- Yes, I have.

00:21:50.026 --> 00:21:51.027
You ever fired a gun
whilst in a high speed pursuit?

00:21:51.069 --> 00:21:52.821
No.

00:21:53.321 --> 00:21:57.617
Annette,
that Sergeant Angel's coming into your shop.

00:21:57.701 --> 00:21:59.369
Get a look at his arse.

00:22:00.036 --> 00:22:02.247
- What about Lethal Weapon?
- No.

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:04.332
- You've seen Die Hard, though?
- No.

00:22:04.416 --> 00:22:06.042
- Bad Boys II?
- No.

00:22:06.126 --> 00:22:07.836
You ain't seen Bad Boys II?

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:13.717
- Hell of a day, huh?
- Yeah.

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.385
- Same again tomorrow?
- Yeah.

00:22:21.183 --> 00:22:24.436
Amanda Paver,
headmistress of Sandford Primary.

00:22:24.519 --> 00:22:25.937
How do you do, Sergeant?

00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:30.859
- Simon Skinner, I believe you've met.
- Oh, we're already firm friends.

00:22:30.942 --> 00:22:32.944
Oh, please, please, come with me, will you?

00:22:33.028 --> 00:22:34.905
This is Leslie Tiller,

00:22:35.197 --> 00:22:39.326
whose horticultural expertise
has helped put Sandford on the map.

00:22:39.576 --> 00:22:41.912
- She's ever so good.
- Oh, go on.

00:22:41.995 --> 00:22:44.414
This is James Reaper,
who owns Brannigan Farm.

00:22:44.498 --> 00:22:46.208
I hear you're quite the marksman.

00:22:46.291 --> 00:22:48.752
Perhaps you might like to join us
for a shoot one day.

00:22:48.835 --> 00:22:51.379
Well, I haven't held a firearm
for over two years, Mr. Reaper.

00:22:51.463 --> 00:22:53.089
I'd quite like to keep it that way.

00:22:53.173 --> 00:22:54.925
You will be popular with the local birds.

00:22:55.467 --> 00:22:56.718
Birds.

00:22:57.469 --> 00:23:00.013
Nicholas, hello. Reverend Shooter.

00:23:00.472 --> 00:23:03.767
I want to ask you,
would you read a homily at Sunday Service?

00:23:03.850 --> 00:23:05.936
That might be
a little hypocritical of me, Reverend.

00:23:06.019 --> 00:23:08.271
Oh, you're an atheist?

00:23:08.355 --> 00:23:09.815
No, I'm... I'm...

00:23:09.898 --> 00:23:12.943
I'm open to the concept of religion,
I'm just not entirely convinced by it.

00:23:13.026 --> 00:23:15.654
- You're an agnostic?
- I think I have a cream for that.

00:23:17.823 --> 00:23:20.951
Robin Hatcher, our resident sawbones.

00:23:21.034 --> 00:23:23.954
Hopefully we won't see too much
of each other over the coming months.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:26.790
Well, all that remains is to welcome you

00:23:26.873 --> 00:23:31.461
to the weekly meeting
of the Neighborhood Watch Alliance.

00:23:33.922 --> 00:23:36.883
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

00:23:37.259 --> 00:23:40.679
Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.

00:23:41.012 --> 00:23:43.056
So, congratulations to her.

00:23:43.140 --> 00:23:45.433
- Tom?
- Thanks, Joyce.

00:23:46.017 --> 00:23:47.102
Now.

00:23:47.853 --> 00:23:52.816
I am sure that all of you will have noticed
the return of a blight to our streets.

00:23:52.899 --> 00:23:57.237
It's made all the more disturbing as
the Village of the Year contest looms.

00:23:57.988 --> 00:24:03.118
I refer, of course,
to the extremely irritating Living Statue.

00:24:08.456 --> 00:24:11.793
Police work
is as much about preventing crime

00:24:11.877 --> 00:24:13.712
as it is about fighting crime.

00:24:13.795 --> 00:24:17.299
Most importantly,
it is about procedural correctness

00:24:17.382 --> 00:24:20.802
in the execution
of unquestionable moral authority.

00:24:21.928 --> 00:24:23.305
Any questions?

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.892
Yes.

00:24:26.975 --> 00:24:29.686
Is it true that there is a place
in a man's head

00:24:29.769 --> 00:24:31.897
that if you shoot it, it will blow up?

00:24:35.817 --> 00:24:37.277
Hi, hi, Tim Messenger.

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.654
Can I get a quick shot
for the Sandford Citizen?

00:24:39.738 --> 00:24:40.906
Okay.

00:24:40.989 --> 00:24:43.116
How about you put the teacher
in handcuffs?

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.701
I don't think that gives off the right signals.

00:24:44.784 --> 00:24:46.661
Too cheesy-pie. Okay. Gotcha.

00:24:47.078 --> 00:24:49.164
- Give the little blonde kid your hat.
- I'd rather not.

00:24:49.539 --> 00:24:51.541
- Wave your hitting stick about.
- No.

00:24:51.625 --> 00:24:52.876
Righty-ho-ho.

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.383
Oh, can I have your autograph, please?

00:25:02.385 --> 00:25:05.430
- For the breakfast.
- Oh, sorry.

00:25:10.393 --> 00:25:12.562
Hey, that weren't me.

00:25:13.814 --> 00:25:16.399
- Morning, Angle.
- Good morning, Angle.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:18.735
- Morning, Angle.
- Morning, Angle.

00:25:18.819 --> 00:25:21.321
- Sergeant Angel.
- Morning. The swan's escaped.

00:25:21.404 --> 00:25:22.864
- The swan's escaped?
- Yeah.

00:25:22.948 --> 00:25:25.158
Right. And where has the swan
escaped from exactly?

00:25:25.242 --> 00:25:27.160
- The castle.
- Oh, yeah? And who might you be?

00:25:27.244 --> 00:25:30.580
Mr. Staker. Yeah, Mr. Peter Ian Staker.

00:25:30.664 --> 00:25:33.750
P.I. Staker. Right. Piss taker. Come on!

00:25:33.917 --> 00:25:37.754
Yes, Mr. Staker. We'll do everything we can.
Can you describe it to me?

00:25:37.838 --> 00:25:39.714
It's about two foot tall.

00:25:39.798 --> 00:25:42.259
- Long slender neck.
- Yeah.

00:25:42.342 --> 00:25:45.220
- Kind of orange and black bill.
- Anything else?

00:25:46.263 --> 00:25:47.722
Well, it's a swan.

00:25:55.689 --> 00:25:57.023
That's just gonna scare it.

00:26:02.404 --> 00:26:07.200
- No luck catching them swans then?
- It's just the one swan, actually.

00:26:09.953 --> 00:26:13.582
- Want anything from the shop?
- You've just been to the shop.

00:26:14.166 --> 00:26:15.709
I was thinking of a different shop.

00:26:15.792 --> 00:26:18.378
Constable Butterman,
this is not the time for personal errands.

00:26:18.462 --> 00:26:22.090
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?
- There is always something going on.

00:26:22.174 --> 00:26:26.094
You have to look closer, all right?
What about this guy?

00:26:26.845 --> 00:26:28.138
- Mr. Treacher?
- Yeah.

00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:30.307
Why has he got that big coat on?

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:34.227
He can't be cold. Why the extra layer?
Maybe he's trying to hide something.

00:26:34.811 --> 00:26:36.271
Mr. Treacher?

00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:38.565
Okay. What about this guy?

00:26:38.648 --> 00:26:41.109
Ask yourself, why has he got his hat
pulled down like that?

00:26:41.193 --> 00:26:44.488
- He's fuck ugly.
- Or he doesn't want you to see his face.

00:26:44.571 --> 00:26:46.615
Because he's fuck ugly.

00:26:47.032 --> 00:26:48.783
Okay, what's his story?

00:26:48.867 --> 00:26:50.327
- Oh, that's Lurch.
- Go on.

00:26:50.410 --> 00:26:52.704
- He's a trolley boy at the local supermarket.
- Good.

00:26:52.787 --> 00:26:54.623
Real name, Michael Armstrong.

00:26:54.706 --> 00:26:56.917
- Dad says he's got a child's mind.
- Okay.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.127
And lives up Summer Street
with his mum and his sister.

00:26:59.211 --> 00:27:00.462
And are they as big as he is?

00:27:00.545 --> 00:27:03.173
- Who?
- The mum and the sister.

00:27:03.256 --> 00:27:04.758
Same person.

00:27:06.134 --> 00:27:07.511
What shop were you thinking of?

00:27:29.491 --> 00:27:32.994
Sergeant Angel to the Manager's office.

00:27:33.078 --> 00:27:36.164
Manager's office. Sergeant Angel.

00:27:38.875 --> 00:27:43.046
Sergeant Angel. Or is it Angle?

00:27:44.756 --> 00:27:47.801
Mr. Skinner, a baby's sicked up in aisle six.

00:27:48.677 --> 00:27:51.263
Please excuse me. Michael!

00:27:51.346 --> 00:27:52.514
Yarp.

00:27:52.597 --> 00:27:56.059
- Child vomit. Aisle six. Mop it up.
- Yarp.

00:27:56.143 --> 00:27:59.354
- Mr. Skinner, is there a problem?
- No, no, no, no.

00:27:59.437 --> 00:28:03.692
I simply wanted to say how lovely it is
to see you supporting your local store.

00:28:03.775 --> 00:28:05.026
Well, that's quite all right.

00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:09.364
All too many have defected
to the big Megamart in Buford Abbey.

00:28:09.447 --> 00:28:13.910
May their heads be struck
from their shoulders for such disloyalty.

00:28:13.994 --> 00:28:17.038
Yes, well, I am on duty,
so if you'll excuse me.

00:28:17.122 --> 00:28:20.625
Of course. I simply spied you loitering
in organic produce

00:28:20.709 --> 00:28:23.336
and assumed you had time on your hands.

00:28:26.798 --> 00:28:29.217
Well, maybe I'm not the one
you should be keeping an eye on.

00:28:29.676 --> 00:28:32.554
That's the Fridge Magnate.
His name's George Merchant.

00:28:32.637 --> 00:28:36.892
Made a fortune in kitchen goods.
Built that monstrosity on Norris Avenue.

00:28:37.684 --> 00:28:40.103
Actually, I wasn't talking about him.

00:28:40.812 --> 00:28:43.565
I was talking about him.

00:28:44.649 --> 00:28:46.109
Excuse me.

00:28:51.865 --> 00:28:52.908
Excuse me.

00:29:02.793 --> 00:29:05.921
"Meet the cop that can't be stopped."

00:29:22.896 --> 00:29:24.189
Tosser!

00:29:26.233 --> 00:29:27.776
Trouble in the high street.

00:29:27.859 --> 00:29:29.528
Sergeant Angel's having a spot of bother.

00:29:29.611 --> 00:29:30.821
Roger that.

00:29:41.206 --> 00:29:42.499
Morning, Sergeant.

00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:51.091
You mothers.

00:29:54.928 --> 00:29:59.599
- Let's cut through here. Head him off.
- Through the gardens?

00:29:59.683 --> 00:30:02.310
What's the matter, Danny?
You never taken a shortcut before.

00:30:46.563 --> 00:30:48.315
Hey, give me that!

00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:56.823
"You do not have to say anything,
however it may harm your defense

00:30:56.907 --> 00:30:59.618
"if you fail to mention when questioned
something you later rely on in court.

00:30:59.701 --> 00:31:01.786
"Anything you do say
can be given in evidence."

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:03.538
- Hi, Danny.
- All right, Pete?

00:31:03.622 --> 00:31:04.748
Do you know this man?

00:31:04.831 --> 00:31:06.541
Yeah, he's Auntie Jackie's
sister's brother's boy.

00:31:06.625 --> 00:31:08.502
And it didn't occur to you
to mention this before?

00:31:08.585 --> 00:31:11.421
Couldn't see his face, could I?
I'm not made of eyes.

00:31:22.015 --> 00:31:23.850
Impressive collar.

00:31:23.934 --> 00:31:26.478
Shame Mr. Skinner
doesn't want to press charges.

00:31:26.561 --> 00:31:28.021
What do you mean,
he doesn't wanna press charges?

00:31:28.104 --> 00:31:31.942
I'm simply suggesting that, you know,
Peter be given a second chance

00:31:32.025 --> 00:31:34.986
before he becomes
just another crime statistic.

00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.906
I'm sure he's going to learn
a valuable lesson.

00:31:37.989 --> 00:31:41.701
- Stealing biscuits is wrong?
- Correct.

00:31:41.785 --> 00:31:42.869
Thanks.

00:31:42.953 --> 00:31:45.831
And yet we respond by not taking
a single punitive measure?

00:31:45.914 --> 00:31:48.875
Well, that's the way the cookie crumbles.

00:31:48.959 --> 00:31:50.877
Like the biscuits, isn't it?

00:31:50.961 --> 00:31:53.839
- Mr. Skinner...
- Is everything all right?

00:31:53.964 --> 00:31:58.969
Well, sir, Mr. Skinner feels it would
be better not to prosecute an individual

00:31:59.052 --> 00:32:01.138
that has committed a blatant offense.

00:32:01.221 --> 00:32:02.681
Leave this with me.

00:32:02.764 --> 00:32:05.934
I'll make sure everyone gets
their just deserts.

00:32:06.017 --> 00:32:07.894
Oh, no!

00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:12.232
Twenty-seven.

00:32:12.315 --> 00:32:15.861
- Have you ever seen Point Break?
- No.

00:32:15.944 --> 00:32:18.280
Amazing bit in Point Break
where they jump over fences.

00:32:18.363 --> 00:32:20.282
Is there now? Twenty-nine.

00:32:20.365 --> 00:32:23.326
Patrick Swayze's just robbed this bank
and Keanu Reeves is chasing him

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:26.329
through people's gardens,
and he goes to shoot Swayze but he can't,

00:32:26.413 --> 00:32:27.581
'cause he loves him so much,

00:32:27.664 --> 00:32:29.833
and he's firing his gun up in the air,
he's like...

00:32:29.916 --> 00:32:31.334
Forty.

00:32:31.418 --> 00:32:33.211
Have you ever fired your gun up
in the air and gone...

00:32:33.295 --> 00:32:36.631
No, I have not ever fired my gun
up in the air and gone...

00:32:36.715 --> 00:32:38.175
Thirty.

00:32:38.258 --> 00:32:41.970
Sorry, I... I just...
I just feel like I'm missing out sometimes.

00:32:42.053 --> 00:32:45.056
- I wanna do what you do.
- You do, do what I do.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:46.933
What on earth
do you think you're missing out on?

00:32:47.017 --> 00:32:50.479
Gun fights. Car chases.
Proper action and shit.

00:32:50.562 --> 00:32:53.982
Police work is not about
proper action or shit.

00:32:54.774 --> 00:32:56.193
Twenty-nine.

00:32:56.276 --> 00:32:57.611
If you had paid attention to me in school,

00:32:57.694 --> 00:33:00.864
you'd understand that it's not all about
gun fights and car chases.

00:33:02.324 --> 00:33:03.617
Fire up the roof.

00:33:08.246 --> 00:33:09.956
That was brilliant.

00:33:12.667 --> 00:33:15.170
Was I going a tad fast, Officer?

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.756
Yes, you were, Mr. Blower.

00:33:17.839 --> 00:33:21.092
Well, now, you see,
we are staging a homage

00:33:21.176 --> 00:33:25.263
to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet
and I'm a little late for the dress rehearsal.

00:33:25.347 --> 00:33:28.391
I'm playing the eponymous hero, you see.

00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:30.268
Romeo not Juliet.

00:33:32.604 --> 00:33:35.357
- What are you writing?
- Everything you're saying.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.858
I might need to refer to it later.

00:33:36.942 --> 00:33:41.029
Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor
so there's no need to...

00:33:41.238 --> 00:33:42.656
Just stop writing, will you?

00:33:42.739 --> 00:33:47.953
Look, I'm merely trying to explain
why I might have exceeded the speed limit.

00:33:48.036 --> 00:33:50.831
You're playing the male lead
in a homage to William Shakespeare's

00:33:50.914 --> 00:33:53.834
Romeo and Juliet
and you're late for the dress rehearsal.

00:33:53.917 --> 00:33:56.795
You think this is sufficient reason
to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?

00:33:56.878 --> 00:33:58.713
- Well, I...
- To flout speed limits

00:33:58.797 --> 00:34:02.843
- specifically put in place to save lives.
- Just, look, this is preposterous.

00:34:02.926 --> 00:34:06.721
- "Preposterous."
- Look, just stop writing!

00:34:06.805 --> 00:34:08.974
"Stop writing."

00:34:10.684 --> 00:34:14.729
Look, you're right, I apologize.

00:34:16.148 --> 00:34:18.483
- See what I did there?
- You hypnotized him.

00:34:18.567 --> 00:34:19.985
No, I used this.

00:34:20.068 --> 00:34:22.571
This is the most important piece
of equipment you will ever own.

00:34:22.654 --> 00:34:25.532
This notebook has saved my skin
more times than I care to mention.

00:34:25.615 --> 00:34:27.159
You should think
about using yours more often.

00:34:27.242 --> 00:34:29.244
- I do use mine.
- Show me.

00:34:34.666 --> 00:34:37.794
- That's just extraordinary.
- You should see the one on the other side.

00:34:43.842 --> 00:34:46.845
- What are you up to tonight?
- I have to water my Peace Lily.

00:34:46.928 --> 00:34:48.472
Thought you might wanna do something.

00:34:48.555 --> 00:34:51.683
- What exactly were you thinking?
- Don't know. Pub?

00:34:51.850 --> 00:34:55.020
I don't think that's a good idea. Do you?

00:34:58.023 --> 00:34:59.524
You two.

00:34:59.691 --> 00:35:04.070
A Mr. Blower left you tickets
for Romeo and Juliet tonight.

00:35:04.154 --> 00:35:05.530
Said it was by way of an apology.

00:35:05.614 --> 00:35:07.157
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:35:07.574 --> 00:35:11.620
Well, we can't accept gifts from somebody
we've officially rebuked. So...

00:35:12.078 --> 00:35:13.288
Yeah.

00:35:14.623 --> 00:35:16.208
Nicholas. Glad I caught you.

00:35:16.291 --> 00:35:20.045
Wondered if you wouldn't mind
representing us at the am drams tonight.

00:35:20.128 --> 00:35:23.048
- Yes, sir, of course.
- And there's a spare for Danny, too.

00:35:23.131 --> 00:35:26.551
Yeah! Hey, come on, it might be fun.

00:35:33.141 --> 00:35:34.184
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

00:35:34.226 --> 00:35:36.937
Here's to my love.

00:35:43.819 --> 00:35:44.986
Now.

00:35:49.783 --> 00:35:53.328
Poison? I'll kiss thy lips.

00:35:54.246 --> 00:35:57.332
Happily some poison
doth yet hang on them.

00:36:05.006 --> 00:36:06.174
Bang!

00:36:25.026 --> 00:36:28.280
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
Quick word for the Sandford Citizen.

00:36:28.947 --> 00:36:30.240
It was very enjoyable.

00:36:30.323 --> 00:36:32.576
- "Cop Enjoys Watching Young Lovers"?
- I don't think so.

00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:34.286
"Local Bobby Gives Thumbs Up
To Teen Suicide"?

00:36:34.369 --> 00:36:35.954
That's just grossly inappropriate.

00:36:36.621 --> 00:36:40.041
You will try and spell his name
correctly this time, won't you, Timothy?

00:36:40.125 --> 00:36:42.586
Absolute tosh, wasn't it?

00:36:42.878 --> 00:36:46.965
And annoyingly, the understudies
are actually professional actors.

00:36:47.132 --> 00:36:49.593
Greg over there was an extra in Straw Dogs

00:36:49.676 --> 00:36:51.553
and Sheree portrayed a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.

00:36:51.636 --> 00:36:53.805
Sergeant Angel, you came?

00:36:53.889 --> 00:36:57.267
So thrilled you accepted my invitation.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.312
Well, our Inspector
requested we attend. So...

00:37:00.395 --> 00:37:05.192
Yeah, we can't accept gifts from
someone we've officially rebuked so...

00:37:05.275 --> 00:37:06.610
Jog on.

00:37:07.277 --> 00:37:10.489
Congratulations to you and to Mrs. Blower.

00:37:12.741 --> 00:37:17.537
Oh, this is not my wife.
This is Miss Draper. My leading lady.

00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:22.334
Eve works in the local council, Sergeant.
Quite the lady in the know.

00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:25.337
- I am not.
- Nonsense.

00:37:25.462 --> 00:37:31.134
I'm sure if we bashed your head in, all sorts
of secrets would come tumbling out.

00:37:33.303 --> 00:37:37.599
Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bitter for Romeo?

00:37:37.682 --> 00:37:39.559
Thank you very much for coming, George.
Excuse us.

00:37:39.643 --> 00:37:41.770
A pleasure, my liege.

00:37:41.853 --> 00:37:45.273
- Eve's nice, ain't she?
- She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

00:37:45.357 --> 00:37:48.777
She was in my year at school.
Always had a thing for her.

00:37:49.569 --> 00:37:51.530
She clearly has a thing for older men.

00:37:52.656 --> 00:37:54.950
What, with Martin Blower? No way!

00:37:55.450 --> 00:37:58.120
We just sat through three hours
of so-called acting, Constable,

00:37:58.203 --> 00:38:00.956
their kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

00:38:01.039 --> 00:38:02.707
Hey, now you come to mention it,

00:38:02.791 --> 00:38:05.418
I too have reason to believe
she favors the older gent.

00:38:05.502 --> 00:38:06.628
Really? How so?

00:38:06.711 --> 00:38:09.798
Marcus Carter's big brother said
he'd fingered her up the duck pond.

00:38:13.301 --> 00:38:14.970
Oh, Officers.

00:38:15.053 --> 00:38:18.682
Again let me extend
my sincere apologies for earlier.

00:38:18.765 --> 00:38:22.144
That's quite all right, Mr. Blower. Drive safe.

00:38:27.357 --> 00:38:30.527
"Drive safe." Oh, my God.

00:38:30.610 --> 00:38:32.988
You know that's the bloke
we done for speeding earlier.

00:38:33.071 --> 00:38:35.991
Yeah. Hopefully,
that's the last we'll see of him.

00:38:48.336 --> 00:38:49.671
Who is it?

00:38:54.259 --> 00:38:55.385
We haven't got long.

00:38:57.345 --> 00:38:58.555
To us.

00:39:00.765 --> 00:39:02.017
Who is it?

00:39:13.904 --> 00:39:15.238
Yeah?

00:39:18.116 --> 00:39:19.951
- ...decaffeinated?
- Decaffeinated?

00:39:24.539 --> 00:39:27.626
Little Brian Libby found them,
out on his paper round.

00:39:28.418 --> 00:39:31.254
Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.

00:39:31.713 --> 00:39:35.634
Must have hit the sign at some speed.
Took the whole top off.

00:39:35.717 --> 00:39:38.762
- I've had my top off in this lay-by.
- Tits.

00:39:38.845 --> 00:39:45.393
Most likely lost control,
left the road there and then ended up here.

00:39:47.062 --> 00:39:51.399
So, what do we reckon?

00:39:52.192 --> 00:39:53.652
Sergeant Angel?

00:39:54.236 --> 00:39:57.072
Well, we should get a proper cordon off,
screen the remains from public view.

00:39:57.155 --> 00:39:58.865
Close down the road
until the ambulance crew arrives,

00:39:58.949 --> 00:40:02.285
whereupon we should open
a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.

00:40:02.828 --> 00:40:04.162
Very good.

00:40:04.830 --> 00:40:05.914
What he said.

00:40:11.294 --> 00:40:13.421
- What happened, Danny?
- Car accident.

00:40:13.505 --> 00:40:15.257
Nasty way to go.

00:40:16.091 --> 00:40:18.093
Constable, official vocab guidelines state

00:40:18.176 --> 00:40:21.263
we no longer refer to these incidents
as "accidents," they're now "collisions."

00:40:21.346 --> 00:40:22.430
Right.

00:40:22.514 --> 00:40:28.645
"For never was there a story of more woe.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

00:40:28.937 --> 00:40:32.607
- Excuse me?
- Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

00:40:32.691 --> 00:40:34.276
Mr. Skinner, do you mind telling me

00:40:34.359 --> 00:40:36.570
how you know the identity
of the persons involved?

00:40:36.653 --> 00:40:40.115
You know how it is. News travels fast.

00:40:40.323 --> 00:40:44.453
A love struck Romeo
sings a streetsus serenade

00:40:45.078 --> 00:40:47.456
- What happened, Danny?
- Traffic collision.

00:40:48.707 --> 00:40:50.625
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?

00:40:50.709 --> 00:40:53.170
Because "accident" implies
there's nobody to blame.

00:40:54.671 --> 00:40:56.089
Put a sock in it, town mouse.

00:40:56.173 --> 00:40:59.926
Yeah, you wanna be a big cop in
a small town, fuck off up the model village.

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:02.429
I'm just saying,
things aren't always as simple as they look.

00:41:02.512 --> 00:41:04.347
Most times they are.

00:41:04.431 --> 00:41:07.184
Let's just wait till Doctor Hatcher
comes back with something,

00:41:07.267 --> 00:41:09.853
before you go jumping the Kalashnikov.

00:41:09.936 --> 00:41:13.064
All right, in the meantime, why don't you
check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?

00:41:13.148 --> 00:41:16.026
Martin Blower represents
damn near most of the village.

00:41:16.109 --> 00:41:17.652
Did you want us to go through
the whole phone book?

00:41:17.736 --> 00:41:20.530
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson,
shall we?

00:41:20.614 --> 00:41:21.948
Please, don't be childish.

00:41:22.032 --> 00:41:23.325
At least consider interviewing the widow.

00:41:23.408 --> 00:41:25.494
Martin Blower was clearly having
an affair with Eve Draper.

00:41:25.577 --> 00:41:28.997
Oh, and how did you establish that?

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:31.833
'Cause we sat through three hours
of so-called acting last night,

00:41:31.917 --> 00:41:34.336
and the kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

00:41:34.419 --> 00:41:36.505
All right, pipe down, big one.

00:41:36.588 --> 00:41:39.132
Here, what else you got,
Crockett and Tubby?

00:41:39.216 --> 00:41:41.635
- Skid marks.
- Now who's being childish?

00:41:41.718 --> 00:41:43.553
There were no skid marks at the scene.

00:41:43.637 --> 00:41:46.598
Doesn't it seem a little strange that
Martin Blower would lose control of his car

00:41:46.681 --> 00:41:48.600
and not think to apply the brakes?

00:41:49.226 --> 00:41:50.519
If there were no skid marks it follows

00:41:50.602 --> 00:41:54.523
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger
did nothing to prevent their fate.

00:41:54.606 --> 00:41:56.608
You don't have to be a detective
to work that out!

00:41:56.691 --> 00:41:57.859
Yeah.

00:41:57.943 --> 00:42:01.029
- Are you causing trouble?
- Yes, they are.

00:42:01.112 --> 00:42:04.324
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

00:42:04.407 --> 00:42:07.911
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping
hedgerows that don't belong to him.

00:42:07.994 --> 00:42:09.704
- Yes, sir?
- That's it.

00:42:10.705 --> 00:42:11.832
Yes, sir.

00:42:17.796 --> 00:42:21.133
- Why do we need the dog?
- It's not the dog we need.

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:29.975
Right.

00:42:30.058 --> 00:42:31.184
What did he say?

00:42:37.065 --> 00:42:38.733
- What did he say?
- He said, "An 'edge is an 'edge.

00:42:38.817 --> 00:42:40.402
"He only chopped it down
'cause it spoilt his view.

00:42:40.485 --> 00:42:41.903
"What's Reaper moaning about?"

00:42:41.987 --> 00:42:43.071
Right.

00:42:43.155 --> 00:42:44.489
Look, I appreciate your position,
Mr. Webley,

00:42:44.573 --> 00:42:47.742
but you can't go around chopping down
other people's hedges without permission.

00:42:49.786 --> 00:42:51.121
"Yes, I suppose."

00:42:51.204 --> 00:42:52.330
Thank you.

00:42:53.081 --> 00:42:54.583
All right.

00:42:56.251 --> 00:42:59.087
Mr. Webley,
I trust you have a license for that firearm?

00:43:01.465 --> 00:43:03.049
He does for this one.

00:43:04.801 --> 00:43:06.261
What do you mean by "this one"?

00:43:19.858 --> 00:43:22.527
By the power of Grey Skull.

00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:24.571
Where on earth did you get these?

00:43:24.654 --> 00:43:26.573
- Found them.
- He found them!

00:43:26.656 --> 00:43:30.243
- And what is this?
- Sea mine.

00:43:30.327 --> 00:43:31.870
Sea mine.

00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:34.664
Well, Mr. Webley,
this is an extremely dangerous collection.

00:43:34.748 --> 00:43:36.249
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.

00:43:36.333 --> 00:43:38.335
No, it's just a lot of junk.

00:43:50.514 --> 00:43:52.599
Move, move, move!

00:44:13.578 --> 00:44:16.456
- You what?
- No, apparently it's been deactivated. Over.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:18.625
That's right, deactivated!

00:44:18.708 --> 00:44:20.627
- It's not live.
- It looks live.

00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:21.795
All right.

00:44:44.818 --> 00:44:47.154
That was quite an impressive haul today,
Constable Butterman.

00:44:47.237 --> 00:44:50.657
Well, you know, I mean, maybe
we should do something to celebrate.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.159
Unless you gotta water your Peace Lily.

00:44:52.242 --> 00:44:55.662
- What exactly did you have in mind?
- I don't know. Pub?

00:45:01.334 --> 00:45:02.961
Right you are, my love.

00:45:03.044 --> 00:45:05.130
Yes, sirs, what can I get you?

00:45:05.213 --> 00:45:06.798
Pint of lager, please, Roy.

00:45:06.882 --> 00:45:08.508
And what can I get you
that isn't a cranberry juice?

00:45:08.592 --> 00:45:11.219
- I don't really wanna get drunk.
- You can get a little drunk.

00:45:11.303 --> 00:45:14.014
- Okay, I'll have one.
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

00:45:14.347 --> 00:45:16.349
Mr. Porter, what's your wine selection?

00:45:16.433 --> 00:45:21.062
Oh, we got red or white.

00:45:22.272 --> 00:45:25.442
- I'll have a pint of lager, please.
- Yeah, Roy.

00:45:30.489 --> 00:45:34.785
- Any news from earlier?
- Yeah. CSI found nothing.

00:45:34.868 --> 00:45:39.372
Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure
and Mrs. Blower has four alibis.

00:45:39.456 --> 00:45:45.378
Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job
to investigate this incident, is it?

00:45:46.213 --> 00:45:47.339
Is it?

00:45:47.464 --> 00:45:49.883
- No, it isn't.
- No, it isn't.

00:45:52.427 --> 00:45:55.680
- You don't switch off, do you?
- You sound like my ex.

00:45:56.306 --> 00:45:59.851
- Well, you are always thinking away.
- It's what I do.

00:45:59.935 --> 00:46:03.355
- Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing.
- Really?

00:46:03.438 --> 00:46:06.066
I mean,
what made you wanna be a policeman?

00:46:06.149 --> 00:46:07.234
Officer.

00:46:07.317 --> 00:46:09.903
What made you wanna be
a policeman-officer?

00:46:12.447 --> 00:46:15.867
I don't remember a time
when I didn't wanna be a police officer.

00:46:15.951 --> 00:46:19.704
Apart from the summer of 1979
when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.

00:46:20.705 --> 00:46:24.709
It all started with my Uncle Derek.
He was a Sergeant in the Met.

00:46:24.793 --> 00:46:27.712
He bought me a police pedal car
when I was five.

00:46:27.796 --> 00:46:29.923
I rode round in it every second I was awake.

00:46:30.006 --> 00:46:33.385
Arresting kids twice my size
for littering and spitting.

00:46:33.468 --> 00:46:36.555
I got beaten up a lot when I was young
but it didn't stop me.

00:46:36.638 --> 00:46:38.557
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.

00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:39.724
He sounds like a good bloke.

00:46:39.808 --> 00:46:42.144
Actually, he was arrested
for selling drugs to students.

00:46:42.227 --> 00:46:43.353
What a cunt.

00:46:43.436 --> 00:46:45.856
Probably bought the pedal car
with the proceeds.

00:46:45.939 --> 00:46:49.234
Needless to say I never went near it again.
I just let it rust.

00:46:49.317 --> 00:46:51.361
But I never forgot
the clear sense of right and wrong

00:46:51.444 --> 00:46:53.446
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.

00:46:53.530 --> 00:46:56.158
I had to prove to myself
that the law could be proper

00:46:56.241 --> 00:46:58.618
and righteous
and for the good of humankind.

00:46:58.702 --> 00:47:02.330
It was from that moment,
I was destined to be a police officer.

00:47:02.956 --> 00:47:04.958
- Shame.
- How so?

00:47:05.041 --> 00:47:07.586
I think you would've made a great muppet.

00:47:11.214 --> 00:47:14.092
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

00:47:14.468 --> 00:47:17.596
I don't know. Dad does it.

00:47:17.679 --> 00:47:21.850
I think after my mum died, it's what
he wanted, you know, keep me close by.

00:47:21.933 --> 00:47:25.937
- Do you mind if I ask how she died?
- Traffic collision.

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:28.106
I'm sorry.

00:47:29.274 --> 00:47:31.485
Never mind. Hey, watch this.

00:47:32.819 --> 00:47:35.238
- Jesus Christ!
- Oh, my eye!

00:47:36.907 --> 00:47:38.074
Ta-da!

00:47:38.158 --> 00:47:39.993
Hey, come on, silly bollocks, get them in.

00:47:52.339 --> 00:47:55.133
- 777.
- Mr. Skinner.

00:47:55.217 --> 00:47:57.803
- You know George Merchant, don't you?
- Evening, Officer.

00:47:57.886 --> 00:48:00.806
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.

00:48:00.889 --> 00:48:04.309
I'd come to know Martin
and Eve very well of late.

00:48:04.392 --> 00:48:05.936
Such a loss.

00:48:06.019 --> 00:48:08.480
What say we drink to their demise?

00:48:08.563 --> 00:48:10.106
Shouldn't that be "drink to their memories"?

00:48:10.190 --> 00:48:12.442
Of course. Cheers.

00:48:12.526 --> 00:48:14.361
I must go to the little boys' room.

00:48:15.737 --> 00:48:18.490
- I'm all right!
- "Little" being the operative word.

00:48:19.074 --> 00:48:21.660
Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:33.130
I think somebody needs to go home.

00:48:33.213 --> 00:48:37.008
- I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir.
- Not you. Him.

00:48:39.094 --> 00:48:40.428
What?

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.559
Hey, we did get a little drunk.
Did you get it?

00:48:45.642 --> 00:48:48.353
'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.

00:48:50.188 --> 00:48:52.107
Oh, good grief.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:55.402
It's hardly in keeping
with the village's rustic esthetic, is it?

00:48:57.279 --> 00:48:59.781
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty quid.

00:48:59.865 --> 00:49:01.867
There you go.

00:49:02.367 --> 00:49:04.578
- And there's your change.
- God bless you.

00:49:05.245 --> 00:49:06.496
Bye-bye.

00:49:09.541 --> 00:49:11.126
I'm all right.

00:49:14.379 --> 00:49:16.214
I would not wanna be him in the morning.

00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:30.187
Well, this is me.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:34.524
Well, I shall see you in the morning.

00:49:34.608 --> 00:49:37.486
Unless you wanna come in
for a cup of coffee?

00:49:37.569 --> 00:49:40.238
- I don't drink coffee.
- Tea?

00:49:40.322 --> 00:49:42.365
No caffeine after midday.

00:49:43.116 --> 00:49:44.993
How about another beer?

00:49:52.709 --> 00:49:53.877
Oh, dear.

00:50:00.217 --> 00:50:03.553
- When did you move in?
- About five years ago.

00:50:04.763 --> 00:50:07.474
- You should get some house plants.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:50:07.557 --> 00:50:10.393
Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily
for about three years now.

00:50:11.978 --> 00:50:15.524
It oxygenates the room,
helps you think, relieves stress.

00:50:15.607 --> 00:50:17.442
Its needs are simple.

00:50:21.738 --> 00:50:24.908
Janine used to say I love my Lily
more than I loved her.

00:50:24.991 --> 00:50:27.244
- Is that why you split up?
- What?

00:50:28.161 --> 00:50:31.581
- 'Cause you did it with a plant?
- No, no, no.

00:50:31.665 --> 00:50:35.210
It was more about me being
obsessed with the job.

00:50:35.502 --> 00:50:37.838
That's good though, right?

00:50:38.338 --> 00:50:39.798
Is it though?

00:50:39.881 --> 00:50:45.178
I did miss a few dinners.
You know, parties, a birthday or two.

00:50:45.262 --> 00:50:48.306
- Listen, mate, I...
- Her dad's funeral.

00:50:49.432 --> 00:50:53.854
- I just wanna be good at what I do.
- You are good at what you do.

00:50:55.438 --> 00:50:59.776
You've just gotta learn to switch off
that big old melon of yours.

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.905
That's the whole problem, Danny.

00:51:07.284 --> 00:51:09.286
I don't think I know how.

00:51:10.203 --> 00:51:12.205
I can show you how.

00:51:18.211 --> 00:51:20.881
By the power of Grey Skull.

00:51:21.631 --> 00:51:24.050
Point Break or Bad Boys II?

00:51:24.134 --> 00:51:25.469
Which one do you think I'll prefer?

00:51:25.552 --> 00:51:27.679
No, I mean which one
do you wanna watch first?

00:51:27.762 --> 00:51:28.972
You are pulling my leg?

00:52:10.013 --> 00:52:12.015
What did you think of that?

00:52:12.098 --> 00:52:14.893
Well, I won't argue
that it was a no holds barred,

00:52:14.976 --> 00:52:18.021
adrenalin fueled thrill ride
but there's no way you could perpetrate

00:52:18.104 --> 00:52:22.359
that amount of carnage and mayhem and not
incur a considerable amount of paperwork.

00:52:22.442 --> 00:52:23.777
That is nothing, man.

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.529
This is about to go off.

00:52:41.628 --> 00:52:43.213
This shit just got real.

00:52:47.092 --> 00:52:48.844
Nasty way to go.

00:52:48.927 --> 00:52:52.931
I think our Mr. Merchant tried to have
a little fry up and left the gas on.

00:52:54.766 --> 00:52:57.936
Spends his whole life
devoted to the refrigerator

00:52:58.186 --> 00:53:00.564
then gets killed by an oven.

00:53:01.565 --> 00:53:04.860
I told him several times,
you shouldn't eat late at night.

00:53:04.943 --> 00:53:07.863
Oh, I don't know.
I quite like a little midnight gobble.

00:53:07.946 --> 00:53:09.156
Cocks.

00:53:09.239 --> 00:53:12.909
So, what do we reckon? Angel?

00:53:14.244 --> 00:53:15.370
Help me.

00:53:15.912 --> 00:53:19.458
Okay, we get a proper cordon up,
we let the fire crews finish their stuff,

00:53:19.541 --> 00:53:22.294
and then we get forensics in
to do a thorough sweep of the house.

00:53:22.377 --> 00:53:25.088
Very good. What he said.

00:53:25.172 --> 00:53:27.299
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi. A quick word?

00:53:27.382 --> 00:53:29.718
Mr. Messenger,
a statement will be issued shortly.

00:53:29.801 --> 00:53:32.471
Actually, I just wanted to ask,
"What's your perfect Sunday?"

00:53:32.554 --> 00:53:34.931
I'll deal with the press, Sergeant.

00:53:35.015 --> 00:53:39.978
Now, my perfect Sunday
is a lovely long lie in...

00:53:40.645 --> 00:53:45.275
Fire to destroy all you've done

00:53:49.529 --> 00:53:50.781
Like in the films.

00:53:51.239 --> 00:53:53.950
Something like,
something out of Backdraft.

00:53:55.786 --> 00:53:59.080
- What are you thinking? Foul play?
- Maybe.

00:53:59.539 --> 00:54:03.084
We're just hoping to talk to the last people
to see Mr. Merchant alive.

00:54:03.502 --> 00:54:08.590
Namely a Sergeant Knickerless Asswipe
and a Constable Fanny Batterbum.

00:54:08.673 --> 00:54:11.593
- That's us.
- Why is this such a big joke to you?

00:54:11.676 --> 00:54:13.136
Three people have died in a week.

00:54:13.220 --> 00:54:15.847
Oh, come on, Doctor Sherlock,
they were accidents.

00:54:15.931 --> 00:54:17.432
People have accidents every day.

00:54:17.516 --> 00:54:20.435
- The victims knew each other.
- Everyone knows everyone round here.

00:54:20.519 --> 00:54:23.772
Yeah. If you didn't see anything suspicious,
then who did?

00:54:29.111 --> 00:54:31.029
It's a bit of a blind spot, I'm afraid.

00:54:31.113 --> 00:54:33.365
We just catch the very edge
of the explosion.

00:54:33.448 --> 00:54:35.283
Nasty way to go.

00:54:35.367 --> 00:54:37.953
- There was something took my eye.
- Really? What's that?

00:54:38.787 --> 00:54:40.997
Sandford's most wanted.

00:54:42.874 --> 00:54:45.252
There you go. It was the swan all along.

00:54:45.335 --> 00:54:48.630
- This is not funny, Detective!
- Oh, give over, Miss Marples.

00:54:48.713 --> 00:54:51.133
Yeah, you do your job
and we'll do ours, eh?

00:54:51.216 --> 00:54:53.468
Yeah. Haven't you got
a church fete to look after?

00:54:53.552 --> 00:54:55.512
No, I have not!

00:54:56.471 --> 00:54:57.639
Actually.

00:55:03.645 --> 00:55:04.688
Testing. Testing.

00:55:04.729 --> 00:55:05.730
Someone's in for a surprise at 3:00,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:55:05.772 --> 00:55:07.816
It's the raffle with
a very special guest presenter.

00:55:07.899 --> 00:55:10.485
Out in the country

00:55:10.735 --> 00:55:14.656
Far from all the sorts of noise of the city

00:55:14.823 --> 00:55:17.325
There's a village green

00:55:17.409 --> 00:55:21.288
It's been a long time since I last set eyes

00:55:21.371 --> 00:55:23.498
On the church with a steeple

00:55:23.582 --> 00:55:25.792
That's me after a couple of pints.

00:55:25.959 --> 00:55:27.335
Splat the rat.

00:55:29.963 --> 00:55:31.715
Splat the rat.

00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.844
Splat the rat.

00:55:37.971 --> 00:55:39.514
Shark!

00:55:41.349 --> 00:55:43.310
Seen any murderings, Nicholarse?

00:55:43.393 --> 00:55:46.021
Come on, boys.
Leave Sergeant Angel alone, he's working.

00:55:46.104 --> 00:55:49.566
Sorry, Chief,
won't waste any more police time.

00:55:49.649 --> 00:55:50.859
Have a nice time.

00:55:50.942 --> 00:55:53.361
Actually, Nicholas,
you might as well take a break.

00:55:53.445 --> 00:55:56.239
Hey, great. I've got something to show you.

00:56:02.204 --> 00:56:05.165
- This is a rifle range.
- You'll be really good at it.

00:56:05.248 --> 00:56:07.709
Feeling lucky, Sergeant?

00:56:08.543 --> 00:56:13.173
Three cans wins you the squeaky bunny,
five cans gets you the floppy lion.

00:56:13.256 --> 00:56:18.345
Take out all the little people,
you get to waltz off with the cuddly monkey.

00:56:19.471 --> 00:56:22.891
I thought I made it clear to you
how I feel about firearms.

00:56:22.974 --> 00:56:25.310
It's only an air rifle.

00:56:25.602 --> 00:56:26.770
Sergeant.

00:56:45.413 --> 00:56:47.124
Dear Lord!

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:50.585
That was amazing.

00:56:55.048 --> 00:56:57.968
- Thank you, Danny.
- I can't believe I shot someone.

00:56:58.051 --> 00:57:01.304
- He's a doctor, he can deal with it.
- I never shot anyone before.

00:57:01.388 --> 00:57:03.598
Danny, believe me,
it's not something you ever get used to.

00:57:03.682 --> 00:57:05.934
Yeah. Maybe we should
go on the bouncy castle.

00:57:06.017 --> 00:57:07.102
Take our minds off of it.

00:57:07.185 --> 00:57:09.104
- Sergeant Angel, hi-hi.
- Mr. Messenger.

00:57:09.187 --> 00:57:11.815
I need to talk to you
about George Merchant. Alone.

00:57:12.274 --> 00:57:14.526
Churchyard. 3:00.

00:57:16.194 --> 00:57:17.320
What do you think he wants?

00:57:17.404 --> 00:57:20.449
Would
Sergeant Angel come to the stage, please?

00:57:23.493 --> 00:57:27.456
Here to announce the winners is the newest
addition to the Sandford Police Force.

00:57:27.539 --> 00:57:28.665
Service.

00:57:28.748 --> 00:57:30.500
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.

00:57:33.044 --> 00:57:34.337
- Prick.
- Wanker.

00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:37.799
Hello. Hello.

00:57:54.858 --> 00:57:59.488
The first name is Simon Skinner.

00:58:02.491 --> 00:58:04.034
He's in the loo.

00:58:04.785 --> 00:58:07.162
Too much of Joyce's lemonade, perhaps.

00:58:29.518 --> 00:58:31.937
And the next name is...

00:58:47.327 --> 00:58:49.663
Tim, your number's up.

00:58:58.713 --> 00:59:00.340
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:59:02.843 --> 00:59:04.052
Hi-hi.

00:59:08.557 --> 00:59:09.850
Oh, no!

00:59:15.188 --> 00:59:18.108
Stand back, stand back!
There's been a terrible accident.

00:59:18.191 --> 00:59:20.902
- Accident?
- Just an accident.

00:59:21.528 --> 00:59:24.281
It's all right, it's all right.
There's nothing to see.

00:59:24.364 --> 00:59:28.201
Come on, everybody. It's all right.
It's just an accident.

00:59:36.918 --> 00:59:38.545
Nicholas, what is it?

00:59:38.628 --> 00:59:42.674
Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.
I think Tim Messenger was murdered.

00:59:43.091 --> 00:59:46.261
- Who could do something like this?
- Maybe it was the swan.

00:59:46.344 --> 00:59:49.431
- Apparently, they can break a man's arm.
- Or blow up a man's house.

00:59:49.514 --> 00:59:52.476
- Listen, you pair of...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.

00:59:52.976 --> 00:59:55.312
Now, let me get this straight.

00:59:56.313 --> 01:00:00.317
- Are you saying that this is a crime scene?
- Yes, sir, I am.

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:01.777
Very well.

01:00:02.319 --> 01:00:03.403
- Detectives.
- Sir.

01:00:03.487 --> 01:00:05.071
Start interviewing everyone
who was at the fete.

01:00:05.155 --> 01:00:06.239
Oh, he's got shorts on.

01:00:06.323 --> 01:00:07.449
- Sergeant Fisher?
- What?

01:00:07.532 --> 01:00:08.950
- Secure the area.
- What?

01:00:09.034 --> 01:00:10.243
- PC Thatcher?
- Yes, love?

01:00:10.327 --> 01:00:11.953
Get the CSI down here.

01:00:12.037 --> 01:00:13.246
PC Walker?

01:00:13.330 --> 01:00:15.624
Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.

01:00:15.707 --> 01:00:18.919
Nicholas, Danny, you know what to do.

01:00:25.217 --> 01:00:27.385
Do you really think this is murder?

01:00:27.552 --> 01:00:29.137
I just don't think we should rule it out,
that's all.

01:00:29.221 --> 01:00:30.722
Yeah. I think you're right.

01:00:30.806 --> 01:00:33.058
I think you're talking a load of old shit.

01:00:33.767 --> 01:00:37.020
He thinks you're talking a load of shit.
Swings and roundabouts, isn't it?

01:00:37.354 --> 01:00:38.605
Pain in the arse.

01:00:38.855 --> 01:00:40.899
- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.

01:00:40.982 --> 01:00:42.818
I was extremely shocked
when I looked at my watch

01:00:42.901 --> 01:00:44.319
and discovered that I should be in the pub.

01:00:44.402 --> 01:00:46.696
Did you go to his house?
Did you read his articles?

01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:50.242
If you wanna wade through every copy of
the Sandford bloody Citizen, be our guest.

01:00:50.325 --> 01:00:52.244
It's your job, isn't it? Detect!

01:00:52.327 --> 01:00:56.581
This ain't the city, Mr. Angel.
Not everyone's a murdering psychopath.

01:00:56.748 --> 01:01:00.168
It's high time you realized that.
You and your monkey.

01:01:03.505 --> 01:01:05.465
Did he mean me or that?

01:01:07.134 --> 01:01:09.344
Oh, maybe we should go home.

01:01:09.553 --> 01:01:12.639
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?

01:01:12.722 --> 01:01:14.349
Have you listened to anything that I've said?

01:01:14.432 --> 01:01:15.559
What do you mean?

01:01:15.642 --> 01:01:17.185
Is anything I've told you
in the last two weeks

01:01:17.269 --> 01:01:19.312
- sunk into that thick skull of yours?
- Yeah.

01:01:19.396 --> 01:01:21.106
Has it? Like what?

01:01:21.648 --> 01:01:23.567
You said I could be
an amazing policeman-officer.

01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:26.069
There's always something going on, Danny.

01:01:26.153 --> 01:01:29.781
And you won't be an amazing police officer
until you understand that.

01:01:29.865 --> 01:01:32.242
Well, I remembered something else
you said and all.

01:01:32.325 --> 01:01:33.952
- Oh, did you now?
- Yeah.

01:01:34.035 --> 01:01:36.329
You don't know how to switch off!

01:02:10.530 --> 01:02:11.990
Well, if you wanna wade through every copy

01:02:12.073 --> 01:02:14.367
of the Sandford bloody Citizen,
be our guest.

01:02:51.947 --> 01:02:54.533
- Morning, Constable.
- All right?

01:02:55.867 --> 01:02:57.786
Thanks for the monkey.

01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:01.164
- Yours, isn't it?
- I won it for you.

01:03:04.793 --> 01:03:06.753
Danny, I think I'm on to something.

01:03:06.837 --> 01:03:08.004
- Are you?
- Yes.

01:03:08.088 --> 01:03:12.425
And I think with a little deliberation
we can figure out what links these deaths.

01:03:12.884 --> 01:03:16.304
- We?
- Come on, partner. Let's go to work.

01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:19.349
Oh, oh, Sergeant Angel?

01:03:19.432 --> 01:03:24.062
- Someone from London called for you.
- Tell them I'll call them back.

01:03:24.896 --> 01:03:26.022
- Tim Messenger.
- Go.

01:03:26.106 --> 01:03:27.941
Editor and journalist
at The Sandford Citizen.

01:03:28.024 --> 01:03:29.317
- Fondness for puns.
- Go on.

01:03:29.401 --> 01:03:30.527
- Terrible speller.
- Oh, yeah?

01:03:30.610 --> 01:03:32.571
Nevertheless had uncovered
important information about...

01:03:32.654 --> 01:03:34.406
- George Merchant.
- Self-made millionaire.

01:03:34.364 --> 01:03:36.533
Fancied himself as a property developer.

01:03:36.616 --> 01:03:39.369
- Said he had big plans for Sandford.
- Pissed on the floor in The Crown.

01:03:39.453 --> 01:03:41.621
But more importantly,
was a good friend and client of...

01:03:41.705 --> 01:03:43.457
- Martin Blower.
- Respected solicitor.

01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:45.792
- Affirmatron.
- Leading light of the local drama society.

01:03:45.876 --> 01:03:47.294
- Bad actor.
- Undoubtedly.

01:03:47.377 --> 01:03:48.920
- Bad driver.
- Not necessarily.

01:03:49.045 --> 01:03:50.672
- Cheated on his missus.
- Most certainly.

01:03:50.797 --> 01:03:52.716
- And we both know who with.
- Eve Draper.

01:03:52.799 --> 01:03:55.635
- Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.
- True.

01:03:55.719 --> 01:03:57.137
- Favored older men.
- Fingered.

01:03:57.220 --> 01:03:58.472
- Worked at?
- Council.

01:03:58.555 --> 01:04:01.266
- More specifically?
- Department of Planning and Development.

01:04:01.391 --> 01:04:02.976
Where George Merchant secured permission

01:04:03.059 --> 01:04:05.437
to build his dubious mansion
on Norris Avenue.

01:04:05.562 --> 01:04:06.646
So...

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:10.817
Maybe they were all accidents.
People have accidents every day.

01:04:12.152 --> 01:04:14.654
- What are you two up to?
- Nothing.

01:04:14.738 --> 01:04:15.864
Well, look sharp.

01:04:15.989 --> 01:04:18.700
- There's been reports of a fire in the station.
- What?

01:04:18.825 --> 01:04:22.454
Happy birthday to you

01:04:22.579 --> 01:04:26.750
Happy birthday to you

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:30.504
- Danny, why didn't you say something?
- We were working, weren't we?

01:04:32.923 --> 01:04:35.967
- Hey, where are you going?
- Personal errand.

01:04:42.766 --> 01:04:44.184
Hello, Miss Tiller.

01:04:44.267 --> 01:04:46.978
I was wondering,
do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

01:04:47.103 --> 01:04:48.480
Of course.

01:04:49.272 --> 01:04:51.691
I was just about to pop off, actually.

01:04:52.526 --> 01:04:54.820
I can never find my scissors.

01:04:55.112 --> 01:04:59.032
- Is this for someone special?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

01:05:01.451 --> 01:05:06.081
- Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
- Yes. I'm moving away.

01:05:07.207 --> 01:05:10.377
And why the move,
if you don't mind me asking?

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:15.298
- Well, just between you and I...
- Yes?

01:05:15.549 --> 01:05:18.426
- You know that fella who blew up?
- George Merchant.

01:05:18.552 --> 01:05:21.680
Well, George Merchant, God rest him,
wanted to buy this land,

01:05:21.805 --> 01:05:25.350
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,

01:05:25.475 --> 01:05:27.561
and I thought I might take them up on it.

01:05:27.644 --> 01:05:31.356
I haven't really got that much family
round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

01:05:31.481 --> 01:05:34.901
So I thought I might take them up
on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

01:05:34.985 --> 01:05:36.987
Would you like a card with this?

01:05:37.154 --> 01:05:39.448
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

01:05:39.573 --> 01:05:42.742
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,

01:05:42.826 --> 01:05:44.995
knew where the new bypass road is going

01:05:45.078 --> 01:05:48.165
because he was knocking off Eve Draper
from the council, God rest her,

01:05:48.248 --> 01:05:51.960
and then that reporter, God rest him,
finds out about the route

01:05:52.085 --> 01:05:54.171
and tells me this land's very valuable.

01:05:54.254 --> 01:05:58.341
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

01:05:58.425 --> 01:06:01.428
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself

01:06:01.511 --> 01:06:04.306
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

01:06:04.431 --> 01:06:06.433
God rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

01:06:06.516 --> 01:06:09.352
Apparently, they want to build
a big shopping center or something.

01:06:09.436 --> 01:06:12.230
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be
too happy about that,

01:06:12.355 --> 01:06:14.399
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

01:06:14.524 --> 01:06:17.110
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

01:06:32.375 --> 01:06:33.543
Stop!

01:06:34.461 --> 01:06:36.046
In the name of the law!

01:07:34.271 --> 01:07:36.231
Hang about, hang about.

01:07:37.107 --> 01:07:39.359
You're saying this wasn't an accident?

01:07:40.694 --> 01:07:42.737
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!

01:07:42.863 --> 01:07:44.281
- What, just like Tim Messenger?
- Yes!

01:07:44.364 --> 01:07:45.532
- And George Merchant?
- Yes!

01:07:45.615 --> 01:07:46.867
- And Eve Draper?
- Yes!

01:07:46.950 --> 01:07:48.577
- And Martin Blower?
- No, actually.

01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:50.537
- Really?
- 'Course he fucking was!

01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.539
Thank you, Danny.

01:07:52.622 --> 01:07:55.959
Oh, murder, murder, murder.
Change the fucking record.

01:07:56.543 --> 01:07:57.711
Thank you, Andy.

01:07:57.794 --> 01:08:02.048
Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept
it was just another nasty accident.

01:08:02.132 --> 01:08:03.216
What are you suggesting?

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:05.802
That Leslie Tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

01:08:05.886 --> 01:08:08.346
Ben Fletcher fell
on his pitchfork the other week.

01:08:08.472 --> 01:08:11.892
Yeah, accidents happen all the time.
What makes you think it was murder?

01:08:11.975 --> 01:08:14.936
- Because I was there!
- There's a point.

01:08:15.061 --> 01:08:16.396
Why were you there?

01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.734
I was buying Constable Butterman
a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

01:08:20.817 --> 01:08:23.403
What absolute horseshit.

01:08:23.487 --> 01:08:27.449
I chased a suspect from the scene.
Innocent people don't run!

01:08:27.574 --> 01:08:30.619
Here, maybe it was our old friend,
the cactus thief.

01:08:30.744 --> 01:08:33.413
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,
weren't he?

01:08:34.247 --> 01:08:36.958
Am I going completely mad?

01:08:39.085 --> 01:08:40.754
Maybe you are.

01:08:42.672 --> 01:08:45.425
Maybe you did it.

01:08:45.509 --> 01:08:48.845
Yeah, seeing as how you're such
a big fan of murder.

01:08:48.929 --> 01:08:50.347
- What the...
- Sergeant Angel?

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:52.933
Yes! Sir.

01:08:55.519 --> 01:08:58.396
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.

01:08:58.522 --> 01:09:01.066
What am I going to do with you?

01:09:01.191 --> 01:09:05.695
- Sir, you have to understand...
- No, you have to understand.

01:09:06.696 --> 01:09:10.659
The boys here aren't used
to the concepts you're bandying about.

01:09:11.284 --> 01:09:13.787
The "M" word, Nicholas.

01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:18.083
There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.

01:09:18.208 --> 01:09:20.001
But, sir, I'm certain.

01:09:20.544 --> 01:09:23.755
And what's more, I know who did it.

01:09:29.803 --> 01:09:31.721
Can I see the manager, please?

01:09:37.227 --> 01:09:43.191
Mr. Skinner to the Manager's office.
Manager's office. Mr. Skinner.

01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:47.362
Sergeant Angel.
And to what do I owe this pleasure?

01:09:47.487 --> 01:09:51.533
Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.

01:09:51.658 --> 01:09:55.078
Leslie Tiller's dead? How?

01:09:55.245 --> 01:09:57.539
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

01:09:59.166 --> 01:10:02.502
I'm also arresting you on suspicion of
the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,

01:10:02.586 --> 01:10:04.212
of George Merchant on April 29th

01:10:04.337 --> 01:10:06.882
and of Eve Draper
and Martin Blower on April 28th.

01:10:07.007 --> 01:10:10.969
- Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant?
- I'm glad you asked.

01:10:12.762 --> 01:10:14.890
My suspicions were first aroused
when you appeared

01:10:15.015 --> 01:10:17.767
at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,
on the outskirts of Sandford,

01:10:17.851 --> 01:10:21.688
despite the fact you live and work
in the center of the village.

01:10:22.939 --> 01:10:27.235
I couldn't help but recall your comments
at the theater on the previous evening.

01:10:27.527 --> 01:10:30.447
When you not only indicated
an awareness of the couple's affair

01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:32.532
but also inferred
that Eve's connections at the council

01:10:32.616 --> 01:10:35.577
might make her privy
to important information.

01:10:35.702 --> 01:10:37.954
You even spoke of "bashing her head in."

01:10:38.038 --> 01:10:41.666
Perhaps hoping you might discover
the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

01:10:41.792 --> 01:10:43.960
You were already suspicious
that George Merchant was buying up

01:10:44.085 --> 01:10:46.338
a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford,

01:10:46.421 --> 01:10:49.382
after an article Tim Messenger
wrote in the Sandford Citizen.

01:10:49.508 --> 01:10:53.136
You see, the land Merchant was buying
had little value in of itself but,

01:10:53.261 --> 01:10:57.140
if it became accessible by road,
it would be a prime location for say,

01:10:57.516 --> 01:10:59.184
a retail park.

01:10:59.267 --> 01:11:01.269
Consumed with concern for your business

01:11:01.353 --> 01:11:03.396
and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

01:11:03.522 --> 01:11:06.066
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

01:11:06.608 --> 01:11:09.277
You killed the competition in cold blood.

01:11:09.361 --> 01:11:11.238
Staging the murders as accidents.

01:11:11.363 --> 01:11:14.407
You used a vehicle removal truck
to stage the Blower-Draper death

01:11:14.533 --> 01:11:16.409
and incinerated an old man
in his own house.

01:11:16.535 --> 01:11:19.704
Covering your tracks with the judicial
application of bacon and beans.

01:11:19.788 --> 01:11:22.749
However, there was a loose end.

01:11:23.792 --> 01:11:25.252
Tim Messenger.

01:11:25.377 --> 01:11:27.504
Splattered before he could share with me

01:11:27.629 --> 01:11:30.549
what he told Leslie Tiller
that very afternoon.

01:11:30.632 --> 01:11:33.468
The true value of her land.

01:11:33.885 --> 01:11:36.763
Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

01:11:36.888 --> 01:11:39.683
you brutally murdered her
with her own shears.

01:11:39.766 --> 01:11:44.521
And made good your escape utilizing
your impressive skills as a fun runner.

01:11:50.986 --> 01:11:54.781
Very entertaining. But I rather think
you've been watching too many films.

01:11:56.408 --> 01:11:57.451
He hasn't.

01:11:57.534 --> 01:12:01.288
Why would I kill Leslie?
You clearly aren't aware that we're related.

01:12:01.413 --> 01:12:03.957
Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:09.796
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy
is only a revelation to yourself.

01:12:10.088 --> 01:12:13.467
My teenage years studying ballet
are well known.

01:12:13.592 --> 01:12:16.720
- Yeah, Sissy Skinner.
- What a Gaylord.

01:12:16.803 --> 01:12:18.346
Thank you, Andrews.

01:12:18.430 --> 01:12:21.808
Now, despite my comments
about "beheading" customers,

01:12:21.933 --> 01:12:25.437
I personally relish the competition
of another store.

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.149
Anything to energize my workforce.

01:12:30.692 --> 01:12:35.280
And anyway, what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?

01:12:35.363 --> 01:12:37.824
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

01:12:37.949 --> 01:12:41.286
It's a well known fact that
the church roof is in dire need of repair.

01:12:41.369 --> 01:12:43.538
And isn't it true
that two of your own employees

01:12:43.622 --> 01:12:46.082
operate the vehicle removal service
for the council?

01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:48.543
Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.

01:12:48.627 --> 01:12:51.546
Many people hold down several jobs.

01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:55.342
I myself host a life drawing class
at the Village Hall.

01:12:55.425 --> 01:12:58.470
Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

01:12:58.804 --> 01:13:02.682
Nevertheless, you could have utilized
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

01:13:02.808 --> 01:13:04.810
These accusations
are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

01:13:04.893 --> 01:13:07.521
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

01:13:07.646 --> 01:13:10.190
Well, you've got me there.

01:13:10.315 --> 01:13:12.275
I'd need something conclusive.

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.528
Something that placed you
at the scene of the crime.

01:13:14.653 --> 01:13:18.657
Perhaps a wound you sustained on
a piece of broken glass this very evening.

01:13:20.325 --> 01:13:21.952
This very evening.

01:13:23.245 --> 01:13:26.498
Sergeant, this is beginning
to get embarrassing.

01:13:26.623 --> 01:13:29.751
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

01:13:32.087 --> 01:13:36.716
I'm sure the store's security footage
will absolve me.

01:13:37.425 --> 01:13:40.095
Do feel free to spool through.

01:13:57.612 --> 01:13:58.655
I can handle this, Danny.

01:13:58.780 --> 01:14:02.033
You might as well go back
and just enjoy the rest of your birthday.

01:14:02.117 --> 01:14:04.703
- Did you really get me that plant?
- Yes, I did.

01:14:04.786 --> 01:14:08.248
But it's been impounded as evidence.

01:14:08.373 --> 01:14:12.961
Well, I mean,
maybe Dad will still let me water it, eh?

01:14:13.044 --> 01:14:14.212
Yeah.

01:14:17.632 --> 01:14:19.050
Sergeant, I wanted you to know that

01:14:19.134 --> 01:14:22.471
if I do indeed now
own the land belonging to...

01:14:24.222 --> 01:14:30.061
belonging to Leslie, that I intend to turn it
into a memorial garden, in her honor.

01:14:30.145 --> 01:14:34.733
Mr. Skinner, what you do with your land
is of no concern of mine,

01:14:37.569 --> 01:14:38.737
so jog on.

01:14:39.654 --> 01:14:44.242
Michael, will you escort the Sergeant
off the premises when he's quite finished?

01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:45.869
Yarp.

01:14:49.039 --> 01:14:53.335
I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?

01:14:53.418 --> 01:14:55.754
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

01:15:03.929 --> 01:15:06.097
Hey, that weren't me.

01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:15.315
Hey, look.

01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.110
Look, Mr. Treacher's
got his big coat on again.

01:15:21.822 --> 01:15:26.201
- You want anything from the shop?
- Cornetto.

01:15:28.787 --> 01:15:32.958
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

01:15:36.378 --> 01:15:39.631
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

01:15:39.714 --> 01:15:43.051
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

01:15:43.135 --> 01:15:47.139
- No luck catching them killers, then?
- It's just the one killer, actually.

01:15:47.222 --> 01:15:50.475
- What's the matter? You got brain-freeze?
- No, I got brainwave.

01:15:50.559 --> 01:15:52.853
Get us back to the station, now!

01:15:59.818 --> 01:16:01.528
- It's more than one person.
- Come again?

01:16:01.653 --> 01:16:04.489
- It's more than one killer.
- It was Skinner a minute ago.

01:16:04.614 --> 01:16:05.657
Yeah, well, maybe it still is.

01:16:05.740 --> 01:16:08.118
You know, maybe he's... Maybe he's
not alone. Maybe there are others.

01:16:08.243 --> 01:16:13.373
Nicholas, you're an exceptional officer.
But I've seen this before.

01:16:13.832 --> 01:16:16.418
- Sir?
- Sergeant Popwell.

01:16:16.501 --> 01:16:19.337
It was exactly the same thing.

01:16:19.421 --> 01:16:23.842
You've come from a city
where there's danger round every corner,

01:16:24.342 --> 01:16:26.845
and it's driven you round the bend.

01:16:27.345 --> 01:16:28.638
Yes, sir.

01:16:28.930 --> 01:16:32.350
Do yourself a favor. Sleep on it.

01:16:32.434 --> 01:16:38.190
And if you still feel the same in the morning,
I give you my word, I'll get right on to it.

01:16:42.527 --> 01:16:45.447
Hey. Hey, what's happening?
What's going on?

01:16:46.114 --> 01:16:50.035
Nothing, nothing.
I'm just gonna go back to the hotel.

01:16:50.118 --> 01:16:55.624
- I mean, do you want a lift?
- No, no, I could do with a walk.

01:17:59.104 --> 01:18:01.982
Hey, big one, playtime's over.

01:18:06.361 --> 01:18:07.737
Michael?

01:18:08.655 --> 01:18:11.324
Michael? Are you there?

01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:15.996
Michael? Is everything okay?

01:18:18.665 --> 01:18:19.833
Yarp.

01:18:19.958 --> 01:18:22.669
Sergeant Angel's been taken care of?

01:18:22.794 --> 01:18:23.879
Yarp.

01:18:23.962 --> 01:18:26.423
He's not gonna get back up again?

01:18:29.050 --> 01:18:30.343
Narp!

01:18:31.636 --> 01:18:34.181
Good. Proceed to the castle.

01:18:39.436 --> 01:18:41.146
Frank, this shit just got real.

01:18:41.229 --> 01:18:45.025
Skinner just sent someone to kill me,
and, now, now he's gone somewhere.

01:18:45.150 --> 01:18:47.694
Up to the... To the castle, I think.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.

01:18:47.819 --> 01:18:50.113
Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:56.703
Oh, my God.
What happened to your Peace Lily?

01:18:56.995 --> 01:19:00.832
Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay?
And watch him, and call your dad.

01:19:00.957 --> 01:19:03.043
- Tell him I was right.
- What are you gonna do?

01:19:03.126 --> 01:19:07.756
- I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.
- Nicholas, wait.

01:19:07.798 --> 01:19:11.551
- You might need this.
- Thanks, partner.

01:19:44.751 --> 01:19:48.171
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

01:19:48.255 --> 01:19:51.424
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

01:19:51.508 --> 01:19:54.803
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

01:19:55.929 --> 01:20:00.058
I just can't believe Leslie's dead.
How did it happen?

01:20:00.183 --> 01:20:03.228
You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.

01:20:03.353 --> 01:20:05.147
Who could do something like this?

01:20:05.272 --> 01:20:08.608
Seems like Mr. Merchant tried
to have a little fry up and left the gas on.

01:20:08.692 --> 01:20:10.026
Nasty way to go.

01:20:10.152 --> 01:20:11.236
What happened, Danny?

01:20:11.361 --> 01:20:13.155
No luck catching them killers, then?

01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:15.115
No luck catching them killers, then?

01:20:15.198 --> 01:20:17.409
No luck catching them...

01:20:20.871 --> 01:20:23.290
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

01:20:23.373 --> 01:20:27.752
Janet Barker has decided
to call her boys Roger and Martin.

01:20:27.878 --> 01:20:33.133
And the christening will be
a week on Saturday and we're all invited.

01:20:33.383 --> 01:20:35.719
- Tom.
- Thanks, Joyce.

01:20:35.969 --> 01:20:39.055
Now, you'll all be delighted to hear

01:20:39.139 --> 01:20:43.810
that the tenacious Sergeant Angel
has been taken care of.

01:20:43.894 --> 01:20:49.483
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying
on the wet floor of his bathroom,

01:20:49.566 --> 01:20:53.820
having slipped
and tragically broken his neck.

01:20:53.945 --> 01:20:55.989
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,

01:20:56.072 --> 01:21:00.160
we will now be able to concentrate
on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.

01:21:00.243 --> 01:21:01.328
Quite right.

01:21:01.411 --> 01:21:04.873
After which, nothing will stand in our way.

01:21:04.998 --> 01:21:07.834
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr. Weaver.

01:21:07.959 --> 01:21:12.172
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

01:21:12.506 --> 01:21:15.675
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police Service.

01:21:15.801 --> 01:21:18.512
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?

01:21:18.595 --> 01:21:21.473
I'm arresting you under suspicion
of conspiracy to commit murder.

01:21:21.556 --> 01:21:24.351
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.

01:21:24.434 --> 01:21:26.019
You should be ashamed.

01:21:26.103 --> 01:21:29.689
- Calling yourself a community that cares.
- Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.

01:21:29.773 --> 01:21:31.525
It's all about the greater good.

01:21:31.608 --> 01:21:33.110
The greater good.

01:21:33.193 --> 01:21:34.694
How can this be for the greater good?

01:21:34.778 --> 01:21:36.321
The greater good.

01:21:36.446 --> 01:21:38.532
You see, as much as I enjoyed
your wild theories, Sergeant,

01:21:38.615 --> 01:21:40.325
the truth is far less complex.

01:21:40.450 --> 01:21:45.622
Blower's fate was simply the result
of his being an appalling actor.

01:21:47.124 --> 01:21:48.375
Quite appalling.

01:21:48.458 --> 01:21:50.210
You murdered him for that?

01:21:51.294 --> 01:21:53.713
- Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
- What?

01:21:53.839 --> 01:21:57.300
The Dramatic Society
is an important feather in our cap.

01:21:57.634 --> 01:21:59.094
Couldn't let
Blower jeopardize that.

01:21:59.219 --> 01:22:01.429
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

01:22:01.555 --> 01:22:04.099
Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in Straw Dogs.

01:22:04.224 --> 01:22:06.059
And Sheree played a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.

01:22:06.143 --> 01:22:07.561
Yes, I know!

01:22:07.644 --> 01:22:10.272
Martin was less concerned
with the reputation of the village

01:22:10.397 --> 01:22:13.567
than he was with his sordid affair
with Eve Draper.

01:22:13.692 --> 01:22:15.235
And so Eve deserved to die too?

01:22:15.318 --> 01:22:17.737
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.

01:22:17.863 --> 01:22:19.072
Annoying.

01:22:19.156 --> 01:22:21.992
- And, and George Merchant?
- He had an awful house.

01:22:22.325 --> 01:22:23.368
Awful.

01:22:23.493 --> 01:22:25.120
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

01:22:25.203 --> 01:22:27.747
more in keeping
with the village's rustic esthetic.

01:22:28.832 --> 01:22:31.418
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

01:22:31.501 --> 01:22:36.214
Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of
the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.

01:22:36.339 --> 01:22:40.135
Our once great paper had
become riddled with tabloid journalism.

01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:42.179
Not to mention persistent errors.

01:22:42.262 --> 01:22:45.515
- He listed her age as 55.
- When, actually, I'm 53.

01:22:45.599 --> 01:22:47.100
Fifty-three.

01:22:47.184 --> 01:22:48.852
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of your own?

01:22:48.935 --> 01:22:51.438
Her horticultural expertise helped
put Sandford on the map.

01:22:51.521 --> 01:22:53.565
Oh, she was ever so good.

01:22:53.690 --> 01:22:55.817
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

01:22:56.109 --> 01:22:59.821
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

01:22:59.946 --> 01:23:03.283
We couldn't have her sharing
her green fingers with anybody else.

01:23:03.366 --> 01:23:05.327
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

01:23:05.452 --> 01:23:08.121
If we can't have her, no one can.

01:23:08.205 --> 01:23:09.748
How can this be for the greater good?

01:23:09.873 --> 01:23:11.875
- The greater good.
- Shut it!

01:23:11.958 --> 01:23:15.128
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!

01:23:15.212 --> 01:23:17.714
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

01:23:19.466 --> 01:23:20.842
Hello, Nicholas.

01:23:21.968 --> 01:23:23.845
I was like you once.

01:23:24.471 --> 01:23:27.891
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

01:23:28.225 --> 01:23:32.020
That is until the night Mrs. Butterman
was taken from me.

01:23:32.938 --> 01:23:35.607
You see,
no one loved Sandford more than her.

01:23:35.732 --> 01:23:39.694
She was head of the Women's Institute,
chair of the floral committee.

01:23:39.778 --> 01:23:41.863
When they started
the Village of the Year contest,

01:23:41.988 --> 01:23:45.659
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.

01:23:47.035 --> 01:23:52.332
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,
some travelers moved into Callahan Park.

01:23:53.166 --> 01:23:56.670
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,"
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

01:23:56.753 --> 01:23:59.089
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

01:23:59.172 --> 01:24:00.924
Crusty jugglers.

01:24:01.049 --> 01:24:04.094
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

01:24:05.095 --> 01:24:09.224
She drove her Datsun Cherry
into Sandford Gorge.

01:24:09.349 --> 01:24:14.438
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.

01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:19.276
And whatever the cost,
we would make Sandford great again.

01:24:19.609 --> 01:24:21.486
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.

01:24:21.611 --> 01:24:25.449
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

01:24:25.574 --> 01:24:28.243
Are you saying this is all about
winning the Best Village Award?

01:24:28.368 --> 01:24:32.038
This is the best village, Nicholas.
You've seen the people.

01:24:32.122 --> 01:24:36.585
- They're happy, contented.
- They're living in a dream world.

01:24:36.710 --> 01:24:39.296
Sergeant Popwell
thought much the same as you.

01:24:39.379 --> 01:24:41.423
I'm disappointed
you can't see the bigger picture.

01:24:41.548 --> 01:24:43.925
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.

01:24:44.050 --> 01:24:45.760
And I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

01:24:45.886 --> 01:24:47.929
You are all gonna have to come with me.

01:24:48.013 --> 01:24:52.100
No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you

01:24:52.184 --> 01:24:54.936
who is going to have to come with us.

01:25:02.986 --> 01:25:04.571
Danny, no.

01:25:08.992 --> 01:25:10.452
Back off! Back off!

01:25:10.577 --> 01:25:12.788
Or I swear to God,
you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over

01:25:12.913 --> 01:25:14.331
and accidentally cut off his own head.

01:25:14.414 --> 01:25:16.583
Come on, Nicholas.
You haven't got it in you.

01:25:16.708 --> 01:25:18.001
I mean it!

01:25:21.671 --> 01:25:22.923
Shit!

01:25:37.687 --> 01:25:41.024
Gypsy scum. Travelers.

01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:44.194
Thieving kids. Dog muck.

01:25:46.446 --> 01:25:48.323
Crusty jugglers.

01:25:48.532 --> 01:25:52.119
Crusty jugglers. Crusty jugglers.

01:25:53.036 --> 01:25:54.329
Crusty jugglers.

01:25:54.454 --> 01:25:58.041
There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.

01:25:58.125 --> 01:26:01.086
There's a reason we accommodate
a few of the younglings at the pub.

01:26:01.211 --> 01:26:03.713
Spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

01:26:03.797 --> 01:26:06.591
I'll make sure everyone gets
their just deserts.

01:26:11.721 --> 01:26:14.599
If we don't come down hard
on these clowns...

01:26:14.724 --> 01:26:16.393
We'll get round to it.

01:26:28.655 --> 01:26:29.823
Danny!

01:27:04.775 --> 01:27:06.109
Ta-da.

01:27:06.359 --> 01:27:09.529
- What are you doing?
- Saving your skin.

01:27:11.782 --> 01:27:14.493
- This is murder!
- It's not, it's ketchup.

01:27:14.576 --> 01:27:17.329
I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about the others.

01:27:17.412 --> 01:27:20.373
- What others?
- The others the NWA have murdered.

01:27:20.415 --> 01:27:21.792
- That's not true.
- It is!

01:27:21.833 --> 01:27:24.044
Dad just said it was his special club, he...

01:27:24.085 --> 01:27:25.962
I thought it was about
rapping people on the knuckles

01:27:26.087 --> 01:27:29.257
- and sending them on their way.
- There are skeletons back there!

01:27:29.341 --> 01:27:30.926
I don't know nothing about no skelingtons.

01:27:31.009 --> 01:27:33.261
- What did you think was happening?
- Not this!

01:27:33.345 --> 01:27:34.471
It's Frank.

01:27:34.596 --> 01:27:36.765
He's appointed himself judge,
jury and executioner.

01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:40.185
- He's not Judge Judy and executioner.
- He is!

01:27:40.268 --> 01:27:43.438
- You've gotta help me take him down.
- I can't.

01:27:44.523 --> 01:27:47.317
He's my dad. Take my car.

01:27:48.401 --> 01:27:51.363
Go back to London.
There's nothing you can do.

01:27:51.488 --> 01:27:52.948
I can come back.

01:27:53.073 --> 01:27:55.158
I can come back,
and I can bring the blue fury

01:27:55.283 --> 01:27:57.285
of the Metropolitan Police Service with me.

01:27:57.369 --> 01:28:00.372
They'll make it disappear.
Who are they gonna believe?

01:28:00.455 --> 01:28:03.208
My dad, or a loony London police officer.

01:28:03.291 --> 01:28:04.835
But it won't be just me, will it?

01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.130
We can do it together.
You and me. Partners.

01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:12.134
Forget it, Nicholas. It's Sandford.

01:29:04.269 --> 01:29:05.604
Is that everything? Sir?

01:29:12.110 --> 01:29:15.530
Sir? Sir?

01:29:17.032 --> 01:29:21.244
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No.

01:29:24.456 --> 01:29:26.750
This is something I have to do myself.

01:29:52.442 --> 01:29:56.279
Another beautiful day in God's country.

01:30:03.954 --> 01:30:05.455
Danny?

01:30:14.506 --> 01:30:15.799
It's...

01:30:21.138 --> 01:30:22.222
Mum!

01:30:33.650 --> 01:30:35.068
What you gonna do?

01:30:35.193 --> 01:30:38.238
Just walk in and arrest the whole village?

01:30:40.031 --> 01:30:41.199
Not exactly.

01:31:14.232 --> 01:31:17.444
Oh, Sergeant Angel?
Someone from London called for you.

01:31:25.577 --> 01:31:27.829
I'll tell them you'll ring them back.

01:31:30.081 --> 01:31:32.250
- Well, that's funny.
- What's that?

01:31:32.751 --> 01:31:35.420
I didn't know we had a mounted division.

01:31:35.504 --> 01:31:37.214
Nobody tells me nothing.

01:31:53.605 --> 01:31:55.398
Wanna do something useful?

01:32:04.866 --> 01:32:09.788
Annette, that Sergeant Angel's
back. Check out his horse.

01:32:10.789 --> 01:32:12.707
Roger that!

01:32:14.459 --> 01:32:17.420
- It's...
- Angel.

01:33:28.700 --> 01:33:29.868
Morning.

01:34:53.452 --> 01:34:55.370
That's what I'm talking about.

01:35:10.302 --> 01:35:12.471
Still feel like you're missing out?

01:35:39.122 --> 01:35:40.540
Fascist!

01:35:57.140 --> 01:35:58.308
Hag!

01:36:16.827 --> 01:36:20.497
Stop! Stop this, please!

01:36:21.164 --> 01:36:24.543
Let us stop this mindless violence.

01:36:25.836 --> 01:36:27.838
Nicholas, my son.

01:36:29.005 --> 01:36:32.926
You may not be a man of God,
but surely you're a man of peace.

01:36:33.009 --> 01:36:38.765
I may not be a man of God, Reverend,
but I know right, and I know wrong,

01:36:39.516 --> 01:36:42.060
and I have the good grace
to know which is which.

01:36:42.185 --> 01:36:45.188
Oh, fuck off, Grasshopper.

01:36:46.773 --> 01:36:48.233
No!

01:36:49.443 --> 01:36:51.194
Jesus Christ!

01:36:51.695 --> 01:36:53.697
Nicholas! Nicholas!

01:37:00.036 --> 01:37:01.788
I thought you was a goner.

01:37:01.872 --> 01:37:03.582
Drop your weapons!

01:37:04.207 --> 01:37:06.626
- Dr. Hatcher, no!
- Shut up, Danny.

01:37:07.627 --> 01:37:11.131
I brought you into this world,
I think it's rather fitting

01:37:11.214 --> 01:37:14.050
I should be the one to take you out of it.

01:37:14.384 --> 01:37:18.221
You and your interfering little friend.

01:37:18.722 --> 01:37:19.848
Now...

01:37:24.227 --> 01:37:25.479
drop them.

01:37:41.995 --> 01:37:46.124
- You're a doctor, deal with it.
- Yeah, motherfucker.

01:37:46.750 --> 01:37:49.085
- Danny, let's roll.
- What you thinking?

01:37:51.087 --> 01:37:52.172
Pub?

01:38:52.315 --> 01:38:54.276
Roy!

01:38:54.985 --> 01:38:58.029
Somebody call the police!

01:38:58.155 --> 01:38:59.281
Freeze!

01:39:02.159 --> 01:39:04.995
Officers, arrest that man.

01:39:05.495 --> 01:39:08.665
- Danny, step away from the Sergeant.
- No, Dad.

01:39:09.082 --> 01:39:11.460
Danny, you'll do as you're told.

01:39:11.585 --> 01:39:14.045
I'm not taking orders from you anymore.

01:39:14.171 --> 01:39:17.632
- Officers, arrest these men!
- Wait, wait!

01:39:17.757 --> 01:39:18.842
You can arrest us if you like.

01:39:18.925 --> 01:39:21.553
You can throw us in prison and go back
to being blind, submissive slaves.

01:39:21.678 --> 01:39:23.472
Or you can be real police officers,

01:39:23.597 --> 01:39:25.766
and help us bring an end
to this absurd story.

01:39:25.849 --> 01:39:28.018
What the fuck is he on about?

01:39:28.101 --> 01:39:29.311
Fuck are you on about?

01:39:29.436 --> 01:39:32.022
Have you ever wondered
why the crime rate in Sandford is so low?

01:39:32.105 --> 01:39:35.901
- And yet the accident rate, it's so high?
- No. Yeah. What?

01:39:36.026 --> 01:39:37.861
You've been brainwashed, Tony.

01:39:37.944 --> 01:39:41.198
Brainwashed into naivety by an old man
with a murderous obsession.

01:39:41.281 --> 01:39:46.203
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it's not, Dad. It's very unridiculous.

01:39:46.286 --> 01:39:49.331
And it's only now that I'm starting to realize
how unridiculous it all is.

01:39:49.456 --> 01:39:50.916
Silence, Danny!

01:39:51.374 --> 01:39:54.169
- Think of your mother.
- Mum is dead, Dad.

01:39:55.378 --> 01:39:58.757
For the first time in my life,
you know, I'm glad.

01:39:58.882 --> 01:40:01.218
If she could see what you've become,

01:40:01.301 --> 01:40:05.430
I think she'd probably kill herself
all over again.

01:40:05.555 --> 01:40:07.099
Sorry, I am completely lost.

01:40:07.224 --> 01:40:08.850
Sandford is a lie, Doris.

01:40:08.975 --> 01:40:12.354
For the last 20 years, the village
has been controlled by Frank and the NWA.

01:40:12.479 --> 01:40:14.898
They've lulled everyone
into thinking this is a perfect village

01:40:14.981 --> 01:40:17.776
and killed anyone
who's threatened to change that.

01:40:25.408 --> 01:40:27.494
I reckon he's got something there.

01:40:28.995 --> 01:40:31.957
He says,
"He reckons you got something there."

01:40:32.082 --> 01:40:33.291
I know.

01:40:33.416 --> 01:40:36.628
You're not seriously gonna
believe this man, are you?

01:40:36.753 --> 01:40:39.798
Are you? He isn't even from round here.

01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:47.973
Maybe it's time to give it up, sir.

01:40:49.683 --> 01:40:52.227
You incompetent flatfoots!

01:41:01.361 --> 01:41:04.030
Officer Walker, stay here with Saxon
and hold everything down.

01:41:04.114 --> 01:41:05.240
Fair enough.

01:41:05.365 --> 01:41:07.367
Officers, let's go.

01:41:08.368 --> 01:41:10.704
- What about Dad?
- He'll come round again.

01:41:11.037 --> 01:41:12.831
Want anything from the shop?

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:31.808
- What you thinking?
- Well...

01:41:31.892 --> 01:41:33.894
We should strike now,
while we've got the element of surprise.

01:41:33.977 --> 01:41:35.771
Longer we wait,
more time they've got to mobilize.

01:41:35.896 --> 01:41:38.648
I say we go in through the front entrance,
take the place aisle by aisle.

01:41:38.732 --> 01:41:40.609
They won't be expecting that.

01:41:41.234 --> 01:41:42.903
Very good. What he said.

01:41:45.155 --> 01:41:48.366
My, my. Here come the fuzz.

01:41:50.577 --> 01:41:53.371
- Maybe they're not here.
- Wait here.

01:41:53.497 --> 01:41:57.000
- Don't go in on your own.
- Don't worry, he knows what he's doing.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.546
Okay. They're in.

01:42:01.671 --> 01:42:04.758
You deal with the store.
I'll deal with the trolley boy.

01:42:14.101 --> 01:42:18.563
No, listen. Wait, wait, wait, Michael,
wait, listen to me. Listen, listen.

01:42:18.772 --> 01:42:21.316
Is this what you really, really want?

01:42:21.608 --> 01:42:22.734
Yarp.

01:42:23.110 --> 01:42:24.319
Suit yourself.

01:42:33.036 --> 01:42:34.704
Go, go, go.

01:42:37.124 --> 01:42:39.209
Oh, come on.

01:42:51.555 --> 01:42:53.390
Andy!

01:42:56.143 --> 01:42:59.104
It's all right, Andy. It's just Bolognese!

01:43:59.539 --> 01:44:01.500
- How's Lurch?
- He's in the freezer.

01:44:01.625 --> 01:44:03.960
- Did you say, "Cool off"?
- No, I didn't say anything, actually.

01:44:04.085 --> 01:44:05.754
Shame.

01:44:05.837 --> 01:44:07.255
There was a bit earlier on that you missed

01:44:07.339 --> 01:44:08.924
when I distracted him
with the cuddly monkey.

01:44:09.007 --> 01:44:11.802
And then I said, "Playtime's over,"
and I hit him with the Peace Lily.

01:44:11.927 --> 01:44:13.970
You're off the fucking chain!

01:44:14.096 --> 01:44:17.557
- What's the situation?
- Two blokes and a fuckload of cutlery.

01:44:17.682 --> 01:44:19.059
What do you reckon?

01:44:22.437 --> 01:44:23.605
Idea.

01:44:47.295 --> 01:44:48.797
Good work, everyone.

01:44:58.557 --> 01:45:01.518
- Nice one, Doris.
- Nothing like a bit of girl on girl.

01:45:04.229 --> 01:45:06.273
Fruit attack!

01:45:07.065 --> 01:45:09.901
Can you handle this, Sergeant Fisher?
We're gonna go after the big boss.

01:45:09.985 --> 01:45:11.903
We're on it, Sergeant.

01:45:12.404 --> 01:45:14.197
- Danny, let's rock.
- Angel!

01:45:14.322 --> 01:45:16.032
Don't go being a twat now.

01:45:16.324 --> 01:45:18.577
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.

01:45:25.834 --> 01:45:27.377
- We should get down there.
- How?

01:45:27.502 --> 01:45:29.880
Skip.

01:45:35.844 --> 01:45:38.889
- Head them off?
- Fuck, yeah.

01:45:50.192 --> 01:45:53.820
- I'll drive.
- Shotgun! Punch that shit!

01:46:37.656 --> 01:46:39.199
Bang! Bang!

01:46:45.163 --> 01:46:46.498
Swan!

01:47:05.934 --> 01:47:07.018
Swan!

01:47:34.546 --> 01:47:38.717
Stay back! Or the ginger nut gets it!

01:47:40.635 --> 01:47:43.221
You little fucker!

01:48:19.007 --> 01:48:23.303
Get out of my village!

01:48:29.267 --> 01:48:31.770
It's not your village anymore.

01:48:48.620 --> 01:48:50.455
- You did good, kid.
- Ta.

01:48:50.539 --> 01:48:52.791
- What's your name?
- Aaron A. Aaronson.

01:48:53.208 --> 01:48:54.668
Sorry?

01:48:56.628 --> 01:49:03.260
Angel!

01:49:21.153 --> 01:49:22.487
It's over, Danny.

01:49:23.905 --> 01:49:25.073
It's over.

01:49:28.910 --> 01:49:34.166
This really hurts.

01:49:34.249 --> 01:49:39.671
I'm going to need some ice-cream.

01:49:39.755 --> 01:49:42.924
Yeah, well, don't worry.
There's plenty of ice-cream at the station.

01:49:43.008 --> 01:49:44.176
Isn't that right, Danny?

01:49:45.427 --> 01:49:46.553
Stay back!

01:49:46.678 --> 01:49:50.098
- Pack it in, Frank, you silly bastard!
- Now, now.

01:49:50.432 --> 01:49:52.184
We don't want any more bloodshed.

01:49:52.267 --> 01:49:55.020
Frank, this whole thing started
because you lost somebody you loved.

01:49:55.103 --> 01:49:57.022
Don't expect me to believe
you'd let it end the same way.

01:49:57.105 --> 01:49:59.649
I'll tell you how this is gonna end!

01:50:42.234 --> 01:50:44.402
I feel like I should say something smart.

01:50:44.486 --> 01:50:47.280
You don't have to say anything at all.

01:50:59.167 --> 01:51:02.587
Satisfactory conclusion
to the whole operation.

01:51:02.671 --> 01:51:06.675
Now, my perfect Sunday would begin with...

01:51:12.013 --> 01:51:13.432
What do you say, Nicholas?

01:51:13.515 --> 01:51:15.725
We... We...
We have been trying to reach you for days.

01:51:15.851 --> 01:51:18.979
- Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy.
- We need you back.

01:51:19.104 --> 01:51:22.899
The figures have gone a little squiffy
in your absence, it has to be said.

01:51:23.024 --> 01:51:24.109
Come back to London.

01:51:24.192 --> 01:51:27.446
Sandford's hardly a fitting place
for such an exceptional officer.

01:51:27.529 --> 01:51:30.240
Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.

01:51:31.199 --> 01:51:32.951
I kind of like it here.

01:51:33.034 --> 01:51:36.413
Besides, we have to do
a considerable amount of paperwork.

01:52:06.818 --> 01:52:07.903
- Fuck's sake, Nick, this is gonna take ages.
- Yeah, it's gonna take all night.

01:52:07.903 --> 01:52:08.904
Well, good job
we've got the manpower, Andy?

01:52:09.237 --> 01:52:13.492
Well, official vocab guidelines state
that we say "staffing," not "manpower,"

01:52:13.575 --> 01:52:16.244
'cause "manpower's" a bit sexist.

01:52:18.663 --> 01:52:20.415
You don't mind a bit
of manpower do you, Doris?

01:52:20.540 --> 01:52:22.834
Oh, dirty bastard!

01:52:24.628 --> 01:52:25.754
Andy!

01:52:25.879 --> 01:52:27.881
You cheeky fucker!

01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:38.558
You know what you are?

01:52:39.392 --> 01:52:41.061
A bloody busybody!

01:52:46.900 --> 01:52:49.152
No!

01:53:03.667 --> 01:53:04.835
Oh, God, no!

01:53:28.108 --> 01:53:29.359
Danny!

01:53:31.862 --> 01:53:32.988
Danny!

01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:35.198
Oh, God.

01:53:35.282 --> 01:53:36.908
Hold on, Danny, just hold on.

01:53:37.033 --> 01:53:39.744
Hold on, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:43.123
Just hang on, hang on!

01:53:43.623 --> 01:53:45.417
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:53:46.710 --> 01:53:48.462
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:53:48.962 --> 01:53:50.756
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:53:51.548 --> 01:53:53.550
Everything's gonna be just fine.

01:54:32.255 --> 01:54:33.298
Hope these are okay.

01:54:36.426 --> 01:54:39.805
Yeah. They're lovely.

01:54:49.356 --> 01:54:52.526
- Any officers near the church?
- Go ahead, Doris.

01:54:52.609 --> 01:54:54.319
Chief, we've had a report
of some hippy types

01:54:54.444 --> 01:54:56.863
messing with the recycling bins
at the supermarket.

01:54:56.947 --> 01:54:58.657
- Leave it with us.
- Righto.

01:54:58.782 --> 01:55:02.869
Sergeant Butterman,
little hand says it's time to rock and roll.

01:55:03.120 --> 01:55:04.663
Bring the noise.
