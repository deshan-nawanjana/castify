WOMAN ON TV:
Day after day...

2
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.600
The store that one might...

3
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.799
I hate television.
It gives me headaches.

4
00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.100
There are so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

5
00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.199
because of TV and television,
we're losing

6
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
10 times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

7
00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.799
Oh, please.

8
00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
"The cow says blank."

Three letters.

10
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.350
Dude!

11
00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:37.899
"Dude"!

12
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.799
I don't know.
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100
I don't understand the
connection between that stuff.

14
00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:44.800
You know what else I heard?

15
00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.000
Magnetic waves shrink
silicone molecules.

16
00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.799
- Aah!
- Aah!

17
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Oh, my God!
Turn it off!

18
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.850
It's not working!

19
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:54.799
It's backwards!

20
00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

21
00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:57.999
Oh, my God!

22
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.400
[Television clicks off,
both sigh]

23
00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:01.999
That was kind of scary.

24
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.200
- I know something even scarier.
- What?

25
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.599
Have you heard about
this videotape?

26
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.800
Where they do it on the boat?
And then in the car?

27
00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.799
And then in the bathtub?

28
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.000
He's like, "Baby, I love you."
And she's like, "Where are we?"

29
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.400
- And did you see the...
- No.

30
00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.999
- Not that tape.
- Oh.

31
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.799
The one with
all the scary images.

32
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.200
After you watch the tape,
the phone rings.

33
00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.400
And this scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in...

34
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:24.800
Seven days. I saw that one
with Josh last weekend.

35
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.000
You were with Josh last weekend?

36
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.200
- Oh, my God!
- [Laughs]

37
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.000
Oh, yes, I was.

38
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.800
Oh, you ho!

39
00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.700
You know it!

40
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.400

[Snaps, whimpers]

44
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This is really weird.

45
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.400
Yeah.

46
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.600
Big house, only one phone.

47
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.800
Hello?

48
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.100
Hello?

WOMAN:
I'm coming for you, my precious.

50
00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.300
Hi, Mom.

51
00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.800
Hi, precious.
Having fun?

52
00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.900

the vibrating showerhead.

[Thunder crashes]

54
00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:25.600
Hello?

55
00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.200
Hello?

Katie?

61
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.800
Katie?

62
00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.900
Are you okay?

63
00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.400
Are you okay?

64
00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200
Aah!

[Wind whipping]

81
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.100
- Tom, did you hear...
- [Dog barks]

82
00:04:49.101 --> 00:04:50.400
The dogs are acting strange.

Sue!

88
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.600
What are you doing out here?

89
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.200
We were worried sick.

90
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.400
What's wrong?

91
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.300
I wonder what they're
trying to tell us.

92
00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.200
ANNOUNCER:
And now...

93
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.400
Washington, D.C.'s
leading morning news program,

94
00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:43.999
"The Morning News."

95
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.599
Good morning.
I'm Ross Giggins.

96
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.000
For our top story,
we turn now to Cindy Campbell.

97
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.400
Thank you, Ross.

98
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.000
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

99
00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.000
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

100
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.799
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

101
00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.400
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

102
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.500
We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

103
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:05.600
But either way,
it's clear something strange

104
00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.600
is happening in that small town.

105
00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.499
Ross?

106
00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.550
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

107
00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:13.600
Coming up, more news after this.

108
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.099
- Cindy, you got a second?
- Sure.

109
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.200
I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club exposï¿½.

110
00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:22.300
But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

111
00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:24.399
Oh, come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

112
00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.400
No, I'm telling you, I sense
something about that cornfield.

113
00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:30.200
Call it women's intuition
or ESPN or both.

114
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.000
But I can tell
when danger's near.

115
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:33.950
[Gasps]
Ow!

116
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:35.899
Ow!
My eyes!

117
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.200
Cindy, it's sweeps month.
Ratings mean everything.

118
00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:41.800
People want
human interest stories.

119
00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.450
Like the one you did yesterday.

120
00:06:43.451 --> 00:06:45.099
The report
on breast augmentation?

121
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.400
It was just 10 minutes
of topless women.

122
00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:49.800
I mean, come on.

123
00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:51.199
MAN: Wow!

124
00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.600
Why are these so interesting?

125
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.999
Oh, for God's sake.

126
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.199
[Sighs]
People don't care about this.

127
00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.800
They want hard-hitting stories
and in-depth coverage and...

128
00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:00.999
And twins!

129
00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.800

that never end</i>

130
00:07:04.801 --> 00:07:07.000

<i>And... And twins</i>

132
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.200
<i>I love burritos
at 4:00 a.m.</i>

00:07:14.901 --> 00:07:17.600
<i>Dogs that love cats</i>

135
00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.050
You think it was
the Kreisel boys

136
00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:24.175
who cut that stuff
into your corn?

137
00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:26.299
All I know is my crops are gone.

138
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.500
The bank's gonna foreclose
if I can't pay the rent.

139
00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:32.800
I got 60 days
to come up with $ 1.50.

140
00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.399
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.600
The last thing you needed
was more...

142
00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.000
[Blowing nose]

143
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.599
...hardship in your life.

144
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.500
Especially after
what happened to...

145
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:44.650
Sheriff, I don't need
your sympathy.

146
00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:46.800
I didn't mean to upset you,
Father.

147
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.150
Please.
I'm not a minister anymore.

148
00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:53.400
I lost my faith
that terrible night.

149
00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:54.999
Your faith will return.

150
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.900
Just as sure
as the sun will rise.

151
00:07:57.901 --> 00:07:59.199
Sounds like a long shot.

152
00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.350
Look, there's always
an explanation

153
00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:03.500
for all this so-called
phenomena.

154
00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:04.700
Maybe you're right.

155
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.800
It was probably
just the Kreisels.

156
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.799
And when I get through
with them,

157
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.200
I doubt you'll be seeing
anything strange on this farm

158
00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:12.400
for a long time.

159
00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.400
You'll see.

160
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.800
You all right, Tom?
Get some rest.

161
00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.550

George!

164
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I need you back here tomorrow
night after you pick up Sue.

165
00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:37.200
That tractor needs fixing.

166
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.400
Sorry, dawg. I can't help you.
I have to get ready for my show.

167
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:43.399
Not that stupid
hip-hop stuff again.

168
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.600
Damn it, when are you going to
do something with your life?

169
00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:46.399
I got a dream!

170
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.699
- What is your dream?
- To have a dream.

171
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.400
George, all you've done
is chase adolescent fantasies.

And now this stupid
hip-hop thing.

175
00:08:58.001 --> 00:08:59.000
For your information,

176
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.500
this hip-hop thing is gonna
get me paid.

177
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:03.350
I'm gonna win that rap battle.

178
00:09:03.351 --> 00:09:05.875
Rap battle?
Oh, for God's sake.

179
00:09:05.876 --> 00:09:07.838
You just hate me
'cause I'm black.

180
00:09:07.839 --> 00:09:09.799
You don't have any faith in me.

181
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.800
You don't have any faith

I know.
You want commitment.

and a grown woman.

As long as we have each other,
that's all we need.

for you since your mom died.

I can be reached on the table.

on his behind.

00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:30.200
No!
We won't lose you again!

707
00:32:30.201 --> 00:32:32.600
Mahalik, help!

708
00:32:32.601 --> 00:32:33.599
Nothing!

709
00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.600
- Ooh!
- [Screams]

710
00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:38.200
She's not breathing!

711
00:32:38.201 --> 00:32:39.000
No!

712
00:32:39.100 --> 00:32:41.200
Live, damn it!
Live!

713
00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.200
Live, damn it!
Live!

714
00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:47.350
Let me open her windpipe!

715
00:32:47.351 --> 00:32:48.975
MRS. MEEKS:
No! Oh, God!

716
00:32:48.976 --> 00:32:50.600
Charles!
Charles, stop them!

717
00:32:50.601 --> 00:32:52.400
Breathe!

718
00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.000
Someone stop them!
What are they doing?!

719
00:32:57.001 --> 00:32:58.599
Get up!

720
00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:00.700
She's alive!
She's alive!

721
00:33:00.701 --> 00:33:03.250
Wake up!
Breathe!

722
00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:05.800
[All shouting]

723
00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.800
- Charles! Charles!
- Clear!

724
00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:16.800
No!

725
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:21.099
Aah!

726
00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.100
I got something!
I got something!

727
00:33:23.101 --> 00:33:26.300
[Gasps, screams]

728
00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:30.199
Aah!

729
00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:31.500
- That's it!
- George!

730
00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:34.400
That's the last time I try to
bring anyone back from the dead.

731
00:33:34.401 --> 00:33:36.350
George, don't get down
on yourself.

732
00:33:36.351 --> 00:33:38.300
I know you were only trying
to help.

733
00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:41.400
You're a good, caring person.

734
00:33:41.401 --> 00:33:43.500
Which is why I like you.

735
00:33:43.501 --> 00:33:44.799
Oh, thanks, Cindy.

736
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:47.099
But I don't want to
screw your life up, too.

737
00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.000
The most caring thing I could do
for everyone right now

738
00:33:49.001 --> 00:33:51.300
is to just get out of here.

739
00:33:51.301 --> 00:33:53.600
George!
What about Sue?

740
00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.400
Oh, yes.
Of course.

741
00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:58.200
Once I get Sue, then...

742
00:33:58.201 --> 00:33:59.400
Wait!

743
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:04.000
I could really use a friend
right now.

744
00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:10.200
Brenda's gone.
Cody resents me.

745
00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.000
And I'm caught up in something
I can't even...

746
00:34:14.001 --> 00:34:15.999
Oh, God, it's so hard!

747
00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.600
Well, you're beautiful and
you're pressing up against me.

748
00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.299
Look, Cindy.

749
00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:27.100
I know you'd never consider
going out with a guy like me.

750
00:34:27.101 --> 00:34:31.400
But if you're not too busy
tomorrow night...

751
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.200
Is that a yes?

752
00:34:35.201 --> 00:34:36.600
Yes.

753
00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:45.600
Cindy, did Brenda
ever talk to you about a tape?

754
00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.399
She did mention something.

755
00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.600
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and look around?

756
00:34:49.601 --> 00:34:51.899
Yes, go.
Of course. Go.

757
00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.500
Cody, I'll be right back, okay?

758
00:34:54.501 --> 00:34:57.050
You're getting lucky tonight.

759
00:34:57.051 --> 00:34:59.600
He doesn't know you're a guy.

760
00:34:59.601 --> 00:35:02.000
[Thunder crashes]

761

768
00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:37.599
Hello?

What?

775
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.800
Can you hear me now?

776
00:36:48.801 --> 00:36:49.999
Kind of.

777
00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
- Can you hear me now?
- Yes. Perfect.

778
00:36:52.001 --> 00:36:53.300
Seven days.

779
00:36:53.301 --> 00:36:54.600
Seven days.

780
00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.600
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die next Monday?

781
00:36:56.601 --> 00:36:57.899
Yes.
No. Wait.

782
00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.000
Monday. That would be
seven business days.

783
00:37:00.001 --> 00:37:01.999
This is seven days starting now.

784
00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.800
So seven days to this very hour?
My watch broke.

785
00:37:04.801 --> 00:37:06.000
How am I gonna know
the exact hour?

786
00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.799
Forget hours.
This day seven days from now.

787
00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:11.500
But there's a holiday coming up.
Do you count the holiday?

788
00:37:11.501 --> 00:37:13.200
Well, that depends.
What holiday?

789
00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.199
- Martin Luther King Day.
- Then no.

790
00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:17.599
Why not? Everybody at work
is taking it off.

791
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.799
Jesus Christ, lady. I'm giving
you seven friggin' days.

792
00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:22.300
I can come over now and kill the
shit out of you if you'd rather.

793

[Click, dial tone]

794
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.350
Yo, George, I don't care
what you say, man.

795
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:30.300
I'm signing you up
for another rap battle.

796
00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.799
Mahalik, I told you.
That part of my life is over.

797
00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.200
I said the same thing about
getting with C.J.'s sister.

798
00:37:35.201 --> 00:37:37.600
- I'm still hitting that.
- He's still hitting it, man!

799
00:37:37.601 --> 00:37:39.600
And she fine as shit!
That's my sister! What?

800
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:41.099
It doesn't matter.
I'm done.

801
00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:43.600
- So what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

803
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.199
Yeah! Yeah!
A-come on!

804
00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:51.200

Maybe I should just settle down.

- Mother...

I got another one, y'all.

on that shit, man.

- Let that go.
- [Laughing]

this shit, George.

the lid off!

Cindy, are you okay?
What's going on?

819

George, you have to help me.

820
00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.399
I just watched the same tape
that killed Brenda.

821
00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.800
Then the phone rang, and this
voice said I was gonna die.

822
00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:31.200
Cindy, there's no such thing
as a killer videotape.

823
00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:32.900
- Oh.
- Hell, yeah, there is!

824
00:38:32.901 --> 00:38:34.450
I know somebody who can
help you.

825
00:38:34.451 --> 00:38:35.999
- You do? Who?
- Wait up, man.

826
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
I heard Jamal from 90th street
watched that tape last week.

827
00:38:39.001 --> 00:38:40.300
This morning he woke up dead.

828
00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.999
How in the hell
do you wake up dead?

829
00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.999
'Cause you're alive
when you go to sleep.

830
00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.800
You're telling me you can go
to bed dead and wake up alive?

831
00:38:46.801 --> 00:38:48.399
MAHALIK:
You can't go to bed dead!

832
00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.600
- That shit would be redundant.
- No, it wouldn't.

833
00:38:50.601 --> 00:38:52.700
'Cause you can go to bed
and not be dead.

834
00:38:52.701 --> 00:38:54.400
And you can die
but not be in a bed.

835
00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:55.599
But you are in a bed, man.

836
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.200
That's how you wake up dead
in the first place!

Damn! That's some quantum shit
right there, man!

into this weird shit.

else knew about it.

- Tonight? Yeah.

we're gonna have so much fun.

848
00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.300
and this really cool
model airplane.

- I'm gonna go get it.
- Sure.

Okay, so I made him a snack.

Sir, I think you need
to go on TV

1070
00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:46.700
and convince the people that
there is no such thing as a UFO.

There's no such thing

- That's not quite true.
- Sir?

A year ago, a UFO crash-landed
in New Mexico.

- A body may have been recovered.
- "May have been"?

1077
00:49:59.901 --> 00:50:02.400
Well, there was
a terrible mix-up.

1078
00:50:02.401 --> 00:50:04.299
It was Thanksgiving.

1079
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:06.699
The body was sent down
to the kitchen.

1080
00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:10.400
They shoved stuffing up its ass,
and we ate it at a state dinner.

No, scratch that.

to put my pants on again?

No, sir. It's just a feeling
I've been having

1089
00:50:24.201 --> 00:50:25.799
since the news about the aliens.

- Something's not right.
- I know what you mean.

It's like that feeling

What is the connection between
the crop circles and the tape?

00:52:15.201 --> 00:52:16.299
The answer is simple.

1106

You are the eventuality
of an anomaly.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:21.200

Aah!
You're hideous!

1231
00:57:09.351 --> 00:57:10.799
Get off my planet!

1232
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.600
- No!
- Is everything all right?

1233
00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:14.800
The exits are all blocked.

1234
00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:16.700
I'll find one, sir.

1235
00:57:16.701 --> 00:57:18.600
Everybody, clear!

1236
00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.399
This way, sir!
God, this is exciting!

1237
00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.300
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

1238
00:57:26.301 --> 00:57:27.999
Cody?

1239
00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.100
Cody?
Cody, where are you?

1240
00:57:31.101 --> 00:57:32.199
Honey?

1241
00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.400
GIGGINS: After today's incident
in the East Room,

1242
00:57:34.401 --> 00:57:36.999
the White House
is now advising all citizens

1243
00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.700
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

1244
00:57:40.701 --> 00:57:42.400
Oh, no.

1245
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.999
And now a News 8 exclusive.

1246
00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.200
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

1247
00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:48.800
We're the only station
that has it,

1248
00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.399
and we're showing it all night.

1249
00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.400
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

1250
00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.800
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

1251
00:57:58.801 --> 00:58:01.200
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

1252
00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.150
- George.
- Cindy.

1253
00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:05.900
There's no time.

1254
00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.199
Cody.

1255
00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.199
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

1256
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.800
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

1257
00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:13.399
No, he didn't.

1258
00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.400
Okay, but I was gonna.

1259
00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.199
No, he wasn't.

1260
00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.700
Cody, the point is you can't
just run away like that.

1261
00:58:20.701 --> 00:58:22.400
I wanted to be with George.

1262
00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.200
Oh, honey, I know
you want a dad, but...

1263
00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.200
Oh, trust me, Cody,
I'm not good at anything.

1264
00:58:28.201 --> 00:58:29.600
Why would I be good at that?

1265
00:58:29.601 --> 00:58:31.900
SUE:
Uncle George!

1266
00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.000
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

1267
00:58:46.001 --> 00:58:48.399
I'm going to die, aren't I?

1268
00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.200
Cody, did I ever tell you
what your mom said

1269
00:58:51.201 --> 00:58:53.200
about you
the day you were born?

1270
00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:54.300
No.

1271
00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.800
I was in the delivery room
with her.

1272
00:58:56.801 --> 00:58:58.599
She was having a hard time.

1273
00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.200
Then you began
to come out of her.

1274
00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.200
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

1275
00:59:03.201 --> 00:59:04.900
She yelled, "Just kill me.

1276
00:59:04.901 --> 00:59:06.600
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

1277
00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:09.400
Whatever you do,
put me out of this pain."

1278
00:59:09.401 --> 00:59:11.499
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

1279
00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.200
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

1280
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:15.999
Well, finally you came out.

1281
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.800
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

1282
00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:21.799
Well, on the second try.

1283
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.400
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

1284
00:59:24.401 --> 00:59:25.900
After all, she was drunk.

1285
00:59:25.901 --> 00:59:27.200
Actually, drugged.

1286
00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.400
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

1287
00:59:30.401 --> 00:59:32.600
She thought, "Hey,
I never tasted crystal meth."

1288
00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:34.400
So she did just a little.

1289
00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.600
My penis?

1290
00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:36.399
Yes.

1291
00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.000
They sewed it on upside down.

1292
00:59:39.001 --> 00:59:40.799
So that's why I pee up?

1293
00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.199
Yes.
We'll get it fixed, honey.

1294
00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.100
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

1295
00:59:45.101 --> 00:59:46.799
Anyway, there you were.

1296
00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.150
Your mom turned to me and said,

1297
00:59:49.151 --> 00:59:51.500
"Hey, you want him?
Take him."

1298
00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:53.050
Then she died.

1299
00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:54.925
And I took you.

1300
00:59:54.926 --> 00:59:56.799
Do you know why?

1301
00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.399
I had just lost my cat
in a fire,

1302
00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.300
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

1303
01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:03.100
And I miss that cat, Cody.

1304
01:00:03.101 --> 01:00:04.599
But I love you.

1305
01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.699
And nothing's
ever gonna change that,

1306
01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.200
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

1307
01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:10.800
TOM:
George!

1308
01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.000
[Banging]

1309
01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:19.599
Are they gone?

1310
01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.800
I don't hear anything.

1311
01:00:20.801 --> 01:00:22.000
[Banging]

1312
01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.600
[Screams effeminately]

1313
01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:29.899
Don't worry, Sue.

1314
01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.100
SUE:
It was Uncle George.

1315
01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.800
Well, it's scary.

1316
01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.200
Good work, Sue.

1317
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.500
I don't know what stupid,
idiotic thing

1318
01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:41.499
made these lights go off.

1319
01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.000
All right, there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

1320
01:00:44.001 --> 01:00:45.500
I can get these lights back on.

1321
01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:46.700
[Banging]

1322
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.200
Quick, George,
grab that railroad tie.

1323
01:00:49.201 --> 01:00:50.800
Jam it against the door.

1324
01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.400
- Oh!
- [Gasps]

1325
01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:54.699
My balls!

1326
01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.800
Oh!
Not those!

1327
01:00:56.801 --> 01:00:58.200
Jesus!

1328
01:00:58.201 --> 01:00:59.600
No!

1329
01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.600
SUE:
Uncle George!

1330
01:01:01.601 --> 01:01:02.999
I'm scared!

1331
01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.800
Oh, sweetie, come here.
It's okay.

1332
01:01:05.801 --> 01:01:07.399
Aah!

1333
01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.400
There's something
on the other side of the door.

1334
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.200
I can't see anything.

1335
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.400
Oh, my God.

1336
01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.050
Can you see them?

1337
01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:44.599
They're horrible.

1338
01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.700
They're grayish
with big black eyes.

1339
01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:48.400
Their teeth are grotesque.

1340
01:01:48.401 --> 01:01:49.999
[Trilling]

1341
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.400
- I think they're giggling.
- What?

1342
01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Oh, no.

1343
01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.499
Oh, no, I think...

1344
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.000
- I think they want...
- [Banging]

1345
01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.099
Aaah!
Help!

1346
01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.700
Cody!
Oh, my God!

1347
01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.099
George.
Swing away, George.

1348
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.000
- Aah! Aunt Cindy, help!
- I'm coming, Cody.

1349
01:02:09.001 --> 01:02:10.400
I'll save you.

1350
01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:11.800
- Ugh!
- Die!

1351
01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.600
Die!

1352
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.650
You damn aliens, let him go!

1353
01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.525
You're not getting in here!

1354
01:02:19.526 --> 01:02:21.400
- What else you got?
- George.

1355
01:02:21.401 --> 01:02:23.499
There!
Had enough?

1356
01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.000
Yeah. Forget it, Cody.
Thank me later.

1357
01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.800
Oh, Cody.
Oh, thank God.

1358
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:28.850
Come on.

1359
01:02:28.851 --> 01:02:29.800
SUE:
Daddy!

1360
01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.200
- Daddy!
- Sue!

1361
01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.200
Oh!

1362
01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.499
Mahalik,
what are you doing here?

1363
01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.050
I told you the hood's
always got your back.

1364
01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:42.600
Thank God.
There's two of them at the door.

1365
01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:43.400
They're gone.

1366
01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.450
Good.
They couldn't get in.

1367
01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:48.175
I hear they can't open doors.

1368
01:02:48.176 --> 01:02:49.899
They mastered space flight,

1369
01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.950
but they can't get
through a wooden door?

1370
01:02:51.951 --> 01:02:54.000
Oh, look, the cellar's
the safest place.

1371
01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:55.900
Women and children stay here.

1372
01:02:55.901 --> 01:02:57.800
- Ugh!
- All right, and the men,

1373
01:02:57.801 --> 01:02:59.199
we go outside and fight.

1374
01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.800
Right. And what's
the cutoff age for children?

1375
01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:03.250
Come on!

1376
01:03:03.251 --> 01:03:04.700
[Groans]

1377
01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.799

- [Shovel cocks]
- Follow me.

1379
01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.200
[Tires screeching]

1380
01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.799
I'm sorry.

1381
01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.200
I thought
I was hitting the brake.

1382
01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.200
Now, we don't have to go
through insurance, do we?

1383
01:03:38.201 --> 01:03:40.200
Mr. President,
what are you doing here?

1384
01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:41.599
I'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

1385
01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.999
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

1386
01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Ah, good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

1387
01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.900
We don't have round planes, sir.

1388
01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:53.350
Oh, my God.

1389
01:03:53.351 --> 01:03:54.800
Oh, my God.

1390
01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
- [Hip-hop music plays]
- Wait. Do you hear that?

1391
01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.400
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1392
01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:02.800
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

1393
01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.000
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

1394
01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.199
- Yo, what's up, George?
- C.J.!

1395
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.900
I told you the 'hood
always got your back.

1396
01:04:11.901 --> 01:04:14.600
I got the boys with me.
Get out the car, man.

1397
01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:15.500
Who we gonna shoot?

1398
01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.800
Is y'all ready to go step?

1399
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.150
Let's go do this,
'cause I'm hyped right now!

1400
01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:21.400
- Real hyped!
- You stepped on my shoe, bitch!

1401
01:04:21.401 --> 01:04:22.400
Call me "bitch" again,

1402
01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.500
and I'll park your truck
dead in your ass.

1403
01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:26.199
Damn, homey!

1404
01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.599
- In the cornfield.
- They're coming!

1405
01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.700
Me and my boys,
we gonna take care of this.

1406
01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:32.000
Come on, let's go.

1407
01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.199
Son, I'd bust
this shit right now.

1408
01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.899
- Your mama!
- I got your number, homey.

1409
01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.000
- We over here, y'all!
- He ain't gonna bust nothing.

1410
01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:39.200
I got nuts bigger than him.

1411
01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.199
Whoa, country-ass,
maple-syrup nigga.

1412
01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.500
Yeah, you want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

1413
01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.800
Get down!
Get down!

1414
01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I can't believe what I just saw.

1415
01:04:58.001 --> 01:04:59.999
These men died
for their country.

1416
01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.200
Send flowers
to their bitches and hos.

1417
01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.499
I can't break free!

1418
01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.200
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

1419
01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.650
- Huh?
- Huh?

1420
01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:18.600
I found it!

1421
01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.600
Without their heads,
they're powerless!

1422
01:05:20.601 --> 01:05:22.399
Please, no.
We mean you no harm.

1423
01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.200
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

1424
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.150
We must destroy her
before seven days.

1425
01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:30.999
You mean you watched
the videotape?

1426
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.500
Our satellite picked up what
we thought was "Pootie Tang."

1427
01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:34.800
That was a week ago.

1428
01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

1429
01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.999
Oh, see?
They are peaceful.

1430
01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
If they're so peaceful,
why were they choking us?

1431
01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.050
Oh, that's how we say hello.

1432
01:05:48.051 --> 01:05:50.000
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.

1433
01:05:50.001 --> 01:05:51.999
- Hello.
- Hello.

1434
01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.900
Well, how do you guys
say goodbye?

1435
01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.199
Oh!

1436
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.799
[Groans]
I had to ask.

1437
01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.700
If you think that's strange,
you should see how we pee.

1438
01:06:02.701 --> 01:06:05.100
[Choking]

1439
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.600
So we're not so different
after all.

1440
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.900
There's something
about this place.

1441
01:06:15.901 --> 01:06:18.400
It's like I've seen it before.

1442
01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.000
Oh, my God.

1443
01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400
This used to be their farm.

1444
01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:29.200
She died right here.

1445
01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.500
There's something down there.

1446
01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.200
Ugh!

1447
01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.000
Hey, awesome.
Yeah, you got it.

1448
01:07:12.001 --> 01:07:13.100
Just look at this.

1449
01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.400
Human beings and aliens
working together.

1450
01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.800
We're all just
one big galactic family.

1451
01:07:19.801 --> 01:07:21.599
Family.

1452
01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.600
That's just what
I've been running away from.

1453
01:07:23.601 --> 01:07:26.800
Well, that's because
you're an idiot.

1454
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.199
This is it.

1455
01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.300
ARCHITECT: My wife took her
to the family farm

1456
01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:42.400
and drowned her in the well.

1457
01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.400
The little girl.
She's frightened of the well.

1458
01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.800
[Gasps]

1459
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.699
Aah!

1460
01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.200
- Ugh!
- Cindy!

1461
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.400
[Crowbar clanks]

1462
01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.100
[Chainsaw sputters, buzzes]

1463
01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.000
Time to go back
down the well, bitch.

1464
01:08:49.001 --> 01:08:50.700
[Growling]

1465
01:08:50.701 --> 01:08:52.399
Cindy!

1466
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.200
No.
Don't hurt him!

1467
01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.499
Cindy, come outside.

1468
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.100
- The aliens aren't invading.
- Aah!

1469
01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:00.699
Aah!

1470
01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.400
Don't worry, Cody.
I'll save you.

1471
01:09:02.401 --> 01:09:04.300
- Aah!
- CINDY: Wait!

1472
01:09:04.301 --> 01:09:06.199
Wait.
Don't do this.

1473
01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.400
You don't have to be evil.

1474
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.800
I know what happened
to you, Tabitha.

1475
01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.800
I know what your mom did.
That was wrong.

1476
01:09:16.801 --> 01:09:18.399
You were just a little girl.

1477
01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.400
You're still that little girl,
just a lot more corpsy

1478
01:09:22.401 --> 01:09:24.800
and with really bad teeth.

1479
01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:28.800
But maybe all you need
is a mother.

1480
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.000
And a father.

1481
01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.400
We could be...

1482
01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500
A family.

1483
01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.599
Thank you all.

1484
01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.000
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

1485
01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:00.700
I'll never have to kill again.

1486
01:10:00.701 --> 01:10:02.300
Really?

1487
01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.000
Nah!
I'm just screwing with you!

1488
01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.999
[Grunts]
Aah!

1489
01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.900
I just want to tell you both
good luck.

1490
01:10:09.901 --> 01:10:11.800
- We're all counting on you.
- [Splash]

1491
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.700
Now it's over.

1492
01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:23.000
- [Gasps]
- Aah!

1493
01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.700
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

1494
01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:26.199
He's our friend.

1495
01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.199
Thank you for saving
our species.

1496
01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.000
Now we must return
to our home planet.

1497
01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.400
Goodbye, then.

1498
01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:32.300
Ugh!

1499
01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.900
Goodbye.

1500
01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.199
Hey, congratulations, George!

1501
01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.000
You know the 'hood
always got your back.

1502
01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.600
Yeah, yeah!

1503
01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.100
Come on!

1504
01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.550
Bye!

1505
01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:05.899
Whoo!

1506
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.800
- Oh!
- Oh!

1507
01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.500
ALL: Bye!

1508
01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.100
Oh, George, I'm so happy.

1509
01:11:22.101 --> 01:11:24.950
Finally we're a family.

1510
01:11:24.951 --> 01:11:27.800
Yeah.
You, me, and...

1511
01:11:27.801 --> 01:11:28.600
- Damn!
- Damn!

1512
01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.750
[Tires screeching]

1513
01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:32.800
Cindy, George, wait!

1514
01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.500
[Sighs]

1515
01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.200
<i>Come on</i>

1516
01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:41.399
<i>"Scary Movie 3"</i>

1517
01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:42.999
<i>Welcome to the future, baby</i>

1518
01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.500
<i>You think you hot shit 'cause
you got ice on your wrist</i>

1519
01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.550
<i>Now, y'all picture this...
tough guy turned snitch</i>

1520
01:11:47.551 --> 01:11:49.600
<i>Knew he was lying
by the way his eyes twitch</i>

1521
01:11:49.800 --> 01:11:50.800
<i>He gulp when he swallow</i>

1522
01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.300
<i>When he spoke,
his voice pitch</i>

1523
01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.000
<i>My first thought's
to slap him up, but I'm grown</i>

1524
01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.600
<i>So I dropped a jewel
in his ear</i>

1525
01:11:55.601 --> 01:11:57.099
<i>Told him get on,
leave it alone</i>

1526
01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.400
<i>Now he's asking questions he
shoulda asked from the start</i>

1527
01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.899
<i>I'm gonna spit from the
heart, spit till it's dark</i>

1528

<i>From the stage in the park,
I'm gonna bite if you bark</i>

1529
01:12:04.001 --> 01:12:05.799
<i>Just to show him
that it's fun to me</i>

1530
01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.900
<i>And take a look at what
being broke gonna mean</i>

1531
01:12:07.901 --> 01:12:10.199
<i>I am the truth,
plus I'm hungry</i>

<i>Heads or tail, playboy,
what's it gonna be?</i>
