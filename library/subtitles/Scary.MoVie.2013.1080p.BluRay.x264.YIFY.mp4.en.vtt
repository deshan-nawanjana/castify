00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.500
WOMAN ON TV:
Day after day...

00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:14.600
The store that one might...

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.799
I hate television.
It gives me headaches.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.100
There are so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

00:00:23.101 --> 00:00:25.199
because of TV and television,
we're losing

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
10 times as many brain cells
as we're supposed to.

00:00:27.201 --> 00:00:29.799
Oh, please.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
"The cow says blank."

00:00:32.801 --> 00:00:34.800
Three letters.

00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:36.350
Dude!

00:00:36.351 --> 00:00:37.899
"Dude"!

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.799
I don't know.
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.100
I don't understand the
connection between that stuff.

00:00:43.101 --> 00:00:44.800
You know what else I heard?

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.000
Magnetic waves shrink
silicone molecules.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.799
- Aah!
- Aah!

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Oh, my God!
Turn it off!

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:53.850
It's not working!

00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:54.799
It's backwards!

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.200
- What do we do?
- I don't know!

00:00:56.201 --> 00:00:57.999
Oh, my God!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.400
[Television clicks off,
both sigh]

00:01:00.401 --> 00:01:01.999
That was kind of scary.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.200
- I know something even scarier.
- What?

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.599
Have you heard about
this videotape?

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.800
Where they do it on the boat?
And then in the car?

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:08.799
And then in the bathtub?

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.000
He's like, "Baby, I love you."
And she's like, "Where are we?"

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:13.400
- And did you see the...
- No.

00:01:13.401 --> 00:01:14.999
- Not that tape.
- Oh.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.799
The one with
all the scary images.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.200
After you watch the tape,
the phone rings.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.400
And this scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in...

00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:24.800
Seven days. I saw that one
with Josh last weekend.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.000
You were with Josh last weekend?

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:29.200
- Oh, my God!
- [Laughs]

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.000
Oh, yes, I was.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.800
Oh, you ho!

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.700
You know it!

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.400
Oh!

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.400

[Snaps, whimpers]

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
This is really weird.

00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:55.400
Yeah.

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.600
Big house, only one phone.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.800
Hello?

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.100
Hello?

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.400
WOMAN:
I'm coming for you, my precious.

00:02:15.401 --> 00:02:16.300
Hi, Mom.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.800
Hi, precious.
Having fun?

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.900
Hey, ask her which bathroom has
the vibrating showerhead.

00:02:21.901 --> 00:02:24.200
[Thunder crashes]

00:02:24.201 --> 00:02:25.600

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.800
Katie?

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.900
Are you okay?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.400
Are you okay?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.200
Aah!

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.900

What are you doing out here?

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.200
We were worried sick.

00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:18.400
What's wrong?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.300
I wonder what they're
trying to tell us.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.200
ANNOUNCER:
And now...

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.400
Washington, D.C.'s

00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:43.999
"The Morning News."

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.599
Good morning.
I'm Ross Giggins.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.000
For our top story,
we turn now to Cindy Campbell.

00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:49.400
Thank you, Ross.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.000
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

00:05:52.001 --> 00:05:54.000
A mysterious
crop circle appeared

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:56.799
in local farmer Tom Logan's
cornfield.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.400
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.500
We'll update you as soon as we
have any further information.

00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:05.600
But either way,
it's clear something strange

00:06:05.601 --> 00:06:07.600
is happening in that small town.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.499
Ross?

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:11.550
I'm sorry.
I wasn't listening.

00:06:11.551 --> 00:06:13.600
Coming up, more news after this.

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.099
- Cindy, you got a second?
- Sure.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:20.200
I want you to take a look at
this for that strip club expos�.

00:06:20.201 --> 00:06:22.300
But I'd rather stick with
the crop circle story.

00:06:22.301 --> 00:06:24.399
Oh, come on. You know
those things are just a hoax.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.400
No, I'm telling you, I sense
something about that cornfield.

00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:30.200
Call it women's intuition
or ESPN or both.

00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:32.000
But I can tell
when danger's near.

00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:33.950
[Gasps]
Ow!

00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:35.899
Ow!
My eyes!

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.200
Cindy, it's sweeps month.
Ratings mean everything.

00:06:39.201 --> 00:06:41.800
People want
human interest stories.

00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:43.450
Like the one you did yesterday.

00:06:43.451 --> 00:06:45.099
The report
on breast augmentation?

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.400
It was just 10 minutes
of topless women.

00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:49.800
I mean, come on.

00:06:49.801 --> 00:06:51.199
MAN: Wow!

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.600
Why are these so interesting?

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.999
Oh, for God's sake.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.199
[Sighs]
People don't care about this.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.800
They want hard-hitting stories
and in-depth coverage and...

00:06:59.801 --> 00:07:00.999
And twins!

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.050
You think it was
the Kreisel boys

00:07:22.051 --> 00:07:24.175
who cut that stuff
into your corn?

00:07:24.176 --> 00:07:26.299
All I know is my crops are gone.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.500
The bank's gonna foreclose
if I can't pay the rent.

00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:32.800
I got 60 days
to come up with $ 1.50.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.399
I'm sorry.

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.600
The last thing you needed
was more...

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:38.000
[Blowing nose]

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.500
Especially after
what happened to...

00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:44.650
Sheriff, I don't need
your sympathy.

00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:46.800
I didn't mean to upset you,
Father.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.150
Please.
I'm not a minister anymore.

00:07:50.151 --> 00:07:53.400
I lost my faith
that terrible night.

00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:54.999
Your faith will return.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.900
Just as sure
as the sun will rise.

00:07:57.901 --> 00:07:59.199
Sounds like a long shot.

00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.350
Look, there's always
an explanation

00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:03.500
for all this so-called
phenomena.

00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:04.700
Maybe you're right.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.800
It was probably
just the Kreisels.

00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:08.799
And when I get through
with them,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.200
I doubt you'll be seeing
anything strange on this farm

00:08:11.201 --> 00:08:12.400
for a long time.

00:08:12.401 --> 00:08:14.400
You'll see.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.800
You all right, Tom?
Get some rest.

night after you pick up Sue.

00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:37.200

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.400
Sorry, dawg. I can't help you.
I have to get ready for my show.

00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:43.399
Not that stupid
hip-hop stuff again.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.600
Damn it, when are you going to
do something with your life?

00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:46.399
I got a dream!

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.699
- What is your dream?
- To have a dream.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.400

is chase adolescent fantasies.

You don't have any faith in me.

You don't have any faith
in anything anymore.

about you,

00:09:13.601 --> 00:09:16.400

Oh, too long.
I've been working so hard.

Well, you know, I just haven't
found the right guy.

I'm looking for something more
than just good sex.

00:10:06.701 --> 00:10:08.199
I know.
You want commitment.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.800
No, I want great sex.
And when I meet that guy...

00:10:18.001 --> 00:10:20.199
Did I say stop drawing?

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.200
Look, when I meet Mr. Right,
I'll know.

00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:24.500
[Humming]

00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:25.800
Uncle George!

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.000
Hey, sweetie!
Come here!

00:10:28.001 --> 00:10:29.599
How are you?
Oh!

00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:32.400
Mmm!
Go get your stuff, okay?

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.700
I know you.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.799
You're Tom Logan's brother.

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:39.200
And you're that reporter,
Cindy Campbell.

00:10:39.201 --> 00:10:41.600
You did the story
on our cop cycles.

00:10:41.601 --> 00:10:42.800
Crop circles.

00:10:42.801 --> 00:10:44.300
Right.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.000
So, you're here
to pick up your...

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:48.599
Nephew, Cody.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.400
You don't dress like a farmer.

00:10:50.401 --> 00:10:51.900
My brother's the farmer.

00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:53.599
I'm the rapper.

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.599
- Hmm.
- Oh, for real.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.199
And here's the 6-1-1 on that.

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.700
That's phone repair.
You mean 4-1-1.

00:11:00.701 --> 00:11:01.600
Right.

00:11:01.700 --> 00:11:05.400
So, I'll be doing the rap battle
at the 23 Club tomorrow night.

00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:07.200
Oh, I don't believe this shit.

00:11:07.201 --> 00:11:08.700
Word!
You two should come down!

00:11:08.701 --> 00:11:10.200
I'll be rappin',
I'll be cappin',

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.000
I'll be tappin',
I'll be flappin',

00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:14.100
I'll be happen-ing.

00:11:14.101 --> 00:11:16.050
Ding, bing, wing.

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:17.999
- Yo!
- Sounds good!

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.800
Would, could, should, 'hood.

00:11:19.801 --> 00:11:21.599
- Ugh!
- Gug, mug, dug, bug.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.200
If we say we'll come,
will you shut your ass up?

00:11:25.201 --> 00:11:27.399
Okay, then.
Fresh.

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.800
I'll see you guys
tomorrow night.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.250
Okay. Bye.

00:11:30.251 --> 00:11:31.500
Peace out.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:38.400
Now, who the fuck did that?

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.200
Honey, what is it?

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.500
Are you having
one of your visions?

00:11:47.501 --> 00:11:49.600
There's a girl...
with black hair.

00:11:49.601 --> 00:11:51.999
She wants to kill you.

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.400
Your period starts
in three... two... one.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.050
What else?
Cody, what else do you see?

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:01.600
I see a little boy
and a grown woman.

00:12:01.601 --> 00:12:02.400
But no father.

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:03.599
Oh, Cody.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.600
I see you kneeling in dog shit.

00:12:05.601 --> 00:12:07.799
What? Ugh!

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.299
Oh, for God's sake.

00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.899
Cody, don't you understand?

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:14.799
As long as we have each other,
that's all we need.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.350
I know things have been tough
for you since your mom died.

00:12:18.351 --> 00:12:21.900
God, I have been so selfish.
Always putting my career first.

00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:24.800
From now on, I'm gonna be
thinking about you 24...

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.599
Damn!

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.300
Wait, Cindy!
Wait!

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.600
Aah!

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:48.300
Honey, I'm gonna be
leaving soon, so...

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.100
Do you know who she is?

00:13:03.101 --> 00:13:04.700
No.

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.100
But sometimes she talks to me.

00:13:07.101 --> 00:13:08.800
She's coming tonight.

00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:11.200
[Knock on door]

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.700
Oh, Father Muldoon.

00:13:22.701 --> 00:13:23.999
Cindy.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.999
I'm so grateful you could come.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.550
I've called all over
for babysitters.

00:13:28.551 --> 00:13:31.100
I don't mind filling in
now and then.

00:13:31.101 --> 00:13:33.000
Where is little Cody?

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:34.799
[Footsteps]

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.199
- [Door slams]
- I don't know.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.999
He must be back in his room,
playing.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Anyway, I left a number where
I can be reached on the table.

00:13:41.001 --> 00:13:43.600
Also, he has a little rash
on his behind.

00:13:43.601 --> 00:13:45.950
So make sure he takes a bath.

00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:48.300
Thank you, Father.
Good night.

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:52.300
Cody?

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.399
<i>You can't stop us</i>

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.800
<i>Who you looking at?</i>

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.450
<i>Don't try to drop us</i>

00:13:57.451 --> 00:13:59.675
<i>This ain't no...</i>

00:13:59.676 --> 00:14:01.900
[Crowd cheering]

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.700
MAHALIK: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's getting thick up in here.

00:14:05.701 --> 00:14:08.400
Hey, look, before we get on
with the battles tonight,

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:10.000
I got a couple announcements
to make.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.300
I know y'all want to bust a cap
in the air

00:14:12.301 --> 00:14:13.499
for your favorite rapper.

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.600
But if you could please hold on
to your gunfire

00:14:16.601 --> 00:14:18.400
until the end of the show.

00:14:18.401 --> 00:14:19.600
[Jeering]

00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.399
Let's just put the safeties on.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.400
It's on the left side of the gun
above the trigger guard.

00:14:24.401 --> 00:14:26.800
[Bullet ricochets,
woman shrieks]

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:29.600
Will somebody get his ass
out of here?

00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:32.800
All right.
Deejay, spin that shit!

00:14:32.801 --> 00:14:35.800
[Up-tempo beat plays]

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.400
[Crowd cheers]

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.000
Whoa!
My bad.

00:14:54.001 --> 00:14:55.600
Mother...

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.899
Brenda, is something wrong?
You look scared.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.800
I don't know. All that stuff
you was saying on TV...

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:07.600
I just got a weird feeling
something bad is heading my way.

00:15:07.601 --> 00:15:09.500
Like when you see
an Asian person

00:15:09.501 --> 00:15:10.799
behind the wheel of a car.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:14.400
Cindy, after the show, you think
you could come back to my crib

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.800
and hang out with me?

00:15:15.801 --> 00:15:17.400
I don't want to be alone.

00:15:17.401 --> 00:15:19.000
Oh, of course I will, Brenda.

00:15:19.001 --> 00:15:21.200
Oh, I love you.

00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:23.000
Pay my way, okay?

00:15:23.001 --> 00:15:24.799
Yo, yo, yo, George!

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:27.100
What's up with the man
with the tightest rap game

00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:28.399
on the streets, baby?

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.000
- What's good with you, boy?
- Dude!

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.899
What's good, baby?

00:15:31.900 --> 00:15:34.700
Finally, the white man is gonna
school the black man

00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:35.599
on how to rap.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:37.599
- Yeah!
- Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.400
How many people are here,
you think?

00:15:39.401 --> 00:15:40.399
I don't know, man.

00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.750
100, 200 whitey-hating,
chrome-packing,

00:15:42.751 --> 00:15:45.099
ready to bust a cap
in any white boy's ass

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.600
- who ain't bringing that shit.
- Yeah. At least. Yeah.

00:15:47.601 --> 00:15:48.400
Mm-hmm.
Word.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.799
What's wrong, George?

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:53.100
You ever wonder when it's time
to stop living up here

00:15:53.101 --> 00:15:54.699
and start living down here?

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:58.400
No, but what if we stop living
over here and move over there?

00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.400
My Aunt ShaNeequa used to live
over there, man.

00:16:00.401 --> 00:16:01.599
But that bitch got evicted.

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.500
- Word? What for?
- I'm dead serious.

00:16:03.501 --> 00:16:05.350
- Mice.
- Mice? I thought she had rats.

00:16:05.351 --> 00:16:07.199
No, man. Rats are outside.
Mice are inside.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.500
What if a mouse goes outside?
Does it become a rat?

00:16:09.501 --> 00:16:11.350
If a rat is in the house,
is it a mouse?

00:16:11.351 --> 00:16:13.200
I ain't never seen
no mouse outside.

00:16:13.201 --> 00:16:14.600
That's because it's a rat, fool!

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:17.900
Damn, you might have just made
a fact just now.

00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:19.900
Fellas, what are you guys
talking about?

00:16:19.901 --> 00:16:21.400
Yo, George, you need something?

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.600
'Cause I will do anything
for you.

perhaps...

00:16:30.551 --> 00:16:32.600
- What he need is a hype man.
- Word!

<i>Yeah, yeah, a-come on</i>

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.450
You can be his Spliff Star.

00:16:35.451 --> 00:16:36.699
That's me.
That's what I do.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.600
That's my job, baby!
That's what I do!

00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:40.000
You know that.
Goddamn.

I'm cool.
That's what I do.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:45.599

you take them hits.

That was hot!

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.400
That's what I'm talking about.
That was hot, right?

00:17:00.401 --> 00:17:02.600
Right?
Yo, what do we think?

00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.300
I thought you were both
absolutely dreadful.

00:17:08.301 --> 00:17:09.250
Ghastly.

00:17:09.251 --> 00:17:10.200
What?

00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.700
I don't know
what I'm doing here.

00:17:12.701 --> 00:17:15.100
This club is totally pathetic.

- It's showtime, baby.
- Okay.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.800
I just want to let you know
no matter what goes on

00:17:30.801 --> 00:17:32.800
on that stage tonight...

Can you feel my love
on your hip?

You do your thing tonight,
all right?

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:56.000
- Okay. Cool.
- We shouldn't have to do that.

Some of y'all call him
Joey Crack.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.399
Stick 'em up!

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:23.500
But, tonight, let's give it up
for Fat Joe!

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.200
But if it had been that night,
I might have missed her.

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.900
She was hit by a truck,
and she's pinned against a tree.

I don't understand.

As long as the truck has her
pinned, she'll stay alive.

all this fancy medical lingo.

I want to see Annie.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.600
She's split in half.

I can talk to the top half?

Yes.

The truck is the only thing
that is holding her together.

Let's say this is
her bottom half.

Can I squeeze in
a few minutes with that?

- No sex.

- No sex!
- Poor Annie.

00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.200
Yo, George, man, you can't focus
on that shit, man.

00:37:59.201 --> 00:38:01.200
- Let that go.
- [Laughing]

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:04.300
Hey, you got to try
this shit, George.

00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.600
Ow!

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.600
Yo, man, you got to take
the lid off!

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.200
- Oh, yes. Of course.
- Sorry!

00:38:12.201 --> 00:38:13.800
[Cell phone rings]

00:38:13.801 --> 00:38:14.399
Hello?

00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.200
CINDY: George, something
terrible has happened!

00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:19.199
[Gasps]

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.000
Cindy, are you okay?
What's going on?

00:38:21.001 --> 00:38:22.799
George, you have to help me.

00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.399
I just watched the same tape
that killed Brenda.

00:38:25.400 --> 00:38:28.800
Then the phone rang, and this
voice said I was gonna die.

00:38:28.801 --> 00:38:31.200
Cindy, there's no such thing
as a killer videotape.

00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:32.900
- Oh.
- Hell, yeah, there is!

00:38:32.901 --> 00:38:34.450
I know somebody who can
help you.

00:38:34.451 --> 00:38:35.999
- You do? Who?
- Wait up, man.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
I heard Jamal from 90th street
watched that tape last week.

00:38:39.001 --> 00:38:40.300
This morning he woke up dead.

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:41.999
How in the hell
do you wake up dead?

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.999
'Cause you're alive
when you go to sleep.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.800
You're telling me you can go
to bed dead and wake up alive?

00:38:46.801 --> 00:38:48.399
MAHALIK:
You can't go to bed dead!

00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.600
- That shit would be redundant.
- No, it wouldn't.

00:38:50.601 --> 00:38:52.700
'Cause you can go to bed
and not be dead.

00:38:52.701 --> 00:38:54.400
And you can die
but not be in a bed.

00:38:54.401 --> 00:38:55.599
But you are in a bed, man.

00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.200
That's how you wake up dead
in the first place!

00:38:58.201 --> 00:39:00.800
Damn! That's some quantum shit
right there, man!

00:39:00.801 --> 00:39:03.099
You should be teaching classes!

00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.200
- Just tell me who can help me!
- Damn!

00:39:05.201 --> 00:39:06.200
My Aunt ShaNeequa.

00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.999
Her and her man
into this weird shit.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.700
They saw the tape before anybody
else knew about it.

00:39:10.701 --> 00:39:13.600
- Go see them tonight.
- Tonight? Yeah.

00:39:13.601 --> 00:39:15.800
But who will take care of Cody?

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.200
CODY: George,
we're gonna have so much fun.

00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.100
I have some puzzles
and board games

00:39:21.101 --> 00:39:22.699
and baseball cards in my room

00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:24.300
and this really cool
model airplane.

00:39:24.301 --> 00:39:25.750
- I'm gonna go get it.
- Sure.

00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:27.199
Okay, so I made him a snack.

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:30.000
You can give him some warm milk
if he can't go to sleep.

00:39:30.001 --> 00:39:31.600
- Everything's gonna be fine.
- Here it is.

00:39:31.601 --> 00:39:34.200
I'm great with kids.
Heads up, Cody.

00:39:34.201 --> 00:39:35.999
Ugh!

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.800
- Oh, I left some numbers.
- I'm okay.

00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:40.199
Ugh!

00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:42.000
Sorry.
You okay, kiddo?

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:44.200
That a boy.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.200
- [Tires screech, horn honks]
- And I guess that's it.

00:39:49.201 --> 00:39:51.600
- Okay, I'm off.
- Right.

00:39:51.601 --> 00:39:53.099
You know, it's funny.

00:39:53.100 --> 00:39:57.100
All a child ever really wants
is a family.

00:39:57.101 --> 00:39:58.200
Yo.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.200
Cody really likes you.

00:40:00.201 --> 00:40:01.600
Oh, he's a good kid.

00:40:01.601 --> 00:40:03.550
Yeah.

00:40:03.551 --> 00:40:05.499
Oh!

00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:07.400
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.700
- [Door closes]
- [Exhales deeply]

00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.000
Hello?

00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.199
I know.

00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:28.200
You're Cindy.
Be right with you.

00:40:28.201 --> 00:40:29.800
Aunt ShaNeequa?

00:40:29.801 --> 00:40:32.299
Bingo.

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.950
But you can call me
the Oracle.

00:40:33.951 --> 00:40:35.599
And don't worry about that vase.

00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:38.000
What vase? Oh!
Sorry. I didn't know.

00:40:38.001 --> 00:40:40.300
Oh! Aah!

00:40:40.301 --> 00:40:42.600
That vase.

00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.500
Please, sit.

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.800
[Farts]

00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.800
It was the chair.

00:40:52.801 --> 00:40:53.999
Mmm.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.300
[Farting loudly]

00:40:57.301 --> 00:41:00.600
Yes, the chair.

00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:03.000
I know why you've come.

00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:05.799
A great mystery
lies ahead of you,

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.250
but you must not shy away
from the challenge.

00:41:08.251 --> 00:41:10.700
- Only you can be the one...

- Orpheus?
- What, baby?

00:41:13.801 --> 00:41:15.599
Sweetie?

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:17.500
I'm watching the game.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.300
Do you mind?

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.700
The Lakers will win by 12.

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:29.750
- So can you tell me about...
- The tape?

00:41:29.751 --> 00:41:32.799
- Yes. I watched it and...
- The phone rang.

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:36.600
- Right. Then this voice said...
- That you would die.

00:41:36.601 --> 00:41:38.800
- Okay, that's getting...
- Extremely annoying.

00:41:38.801 --> 00:41:39.899
Yeah.

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.599
Try being married to her.

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:45.200
I catch shit about women
I ain't slept with yet.

00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.000
You made a copy of the tape.
Let's see it.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.900
Yes. Okay.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.499
ShaNeequa, can you tell me if...

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.350
The tape is connected to the
crop circles and the aliens?

00:42:01.351 --> 00:42:05.200
Yes. But it's up to you
to discover how for yourself.

00:42:05.300 --> 00:42:06.300
Look, it's a...

00:42:08.200 --> 00:42:10.800
I was going to say lighthouse.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:14.400
ORPHEUS: Find that lighthouse.
It's your destiny.

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:17.200
Wait.

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.200
What is that?

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.200
Oh, my God.

Now, baby.

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:51.400
I knew that was gonna happen.

Oh, hell, no.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:59.400
Get your ass out of the TV!
What's wrong with you?

00:42:59.401 --> 00:43:00.900
I'm gonna teach you!

00:43:00.901 --> 00:43:02.399
Get out of that TV!

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.800
Baby, no! No!
Let her go! Let her go!

00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:07.050
Let her go!
We gonna get another lawsuit.

00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:09.200
She spit on me.
I'm gonna kill the bitch.

Ah!

You won.
You won.

You won.
You won.

00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:14.350
- Upstairs.
- Okay.

00:43:14.351 --> 00:43:15.600
- Down low.
- Okay.

00:43:15.800 --> 00:43:17.199
- All right.
- Baby, no!

00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:20.000
- Kill her! Is you crazy?
- Baby!

[Laughs]
What you gonna brush now?

00:43:22.801 --> 00:43:24.200
What you gonna brush now, huh?

00:43:24.201 --> 00:43:25.199
Come on, baby!

00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.200
You picked the wrong TV
to come out of.

00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:35.400
George?
Cody?

00:43:35.401 --> 00:43:36.800
Oh!

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.599
George?

00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.600
- Ow!
- What happened?

00:43:41.601 --> 00:43:43.199
I don't know.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.200
Cody and I were playing
a fun game,

00:43:45.201 --> 00:43:46.800
and then I looked down.

00:43:46.801 --> 00:43:49.100
[Gasps]
Yahtzee!

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.100
No!

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.800
Oh, my God!

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.600
How could you let him
watch the tape?

00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:03.200
[Telephone ringing]

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.799
Hello?

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.599
- MAN: It's me. How you doing?
- Fine.

00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:18.400
Enjoying your last week?
I can't wait to see you.

00:44:18.401 --> 00:44:21.399
- Six days now, right?
- Yeah.

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.800
It was great catching up.
Can I speak to Cody?

00:44:23.801 --> 00:44:25.999
Why?
He didn't watch the tape.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Yes, he did. Come on, Cindy,
I do this for a living.

00:44:29.001 --> 00:44:30.800
Leave us alone!

00:44:31.500 --> 00:44:33.000

00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:36.599
Hello?

00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.300
Hello, I'm calling
from "Reader's Digest"

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.000
with a fantastic offer
for Cody.

00:44:40.001 --> 00:44:41.599
- [Snickering]
- Aah!

00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.400
No, you're not! You're that evil
little girl from the tape!

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.299
[Laughs]
Okay, you got me.

00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:48.000
How about I just leave
a message for him?

00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:49.600
Fine.

00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:52.399
Uh-huh.

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:56.000
Yeah. Okay, how do you
spell that?

00:44:56.001 --> 00:44:56.799
Right.

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:00.000
Okay, got it.
Bye-bye.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:05.000
Aaaah!

00:45:05.500 --> 00:45:06.950
I can't believe
you let that happen.

00:45:06.951 --> 00:45:08.400
I know. I'm sorry.
I screwed up.

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:10.599
Listen, we can still save him.

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.600
The answer to the tape,
to your crop circles,

00:45:12.601 --> 00:45:14.199
is at a lighthouse.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:16.000
Oh, you think I'm crazy,
don't you?

00:45:16.001 --> 00:45:16.999
Of course I do.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000
But the last thing you need now
is a screw-up like me.

00:45:20.001 --> 00:45:21.800
I'm gonna leave for good.

00:45:21.801 --> 00:45:23.000
Wait.

00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.400
Well, what should I tell Cody?

00:45:28.401 --> 00:45:29.200
Let him down easy.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.400
Tell him I got called away
on business.

00:45:31.401 --> 00:45:33.099
You'll think of something.

00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.600
Testicular cancer.
He won't ask questions.

00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.400
I knew you'd understand.

00:45:37.401 --> 00:45:38.850
George!

00:45:38.851 --> 00:45:40.425
Just...

00:45:40.426 --> 00:45:42.000
be careful.

00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:44.600
Something weird is going on
at your farm. I know it.

00:45:44.601 --> 00:45:45.800
I don't know.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.200
Sometimes a sheep needs
pushed through the fence.

00:45:48.201 --> 00:45:50.400
- What?
- Goodbye, Cindy.

00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:54.400
[Girl chanting]

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.199
- Sue?
- I can't sleep.

00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:20.200
Well, it's way past
your bedtime.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:26.000
Won't you rock me to sleep
in your big, strong arms?

00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:30.400
There's plenty of room
under the covers.

00:46:30.401 --> 00:46:32.399
It's a hot night.

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.800
You don't need to wear pajamas.

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:37.599
Where is my daughter?

00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:40.000
Are you mad?
I am your daughter.

00:46:40.001 --> 00:46:41.600
No, you're not!

00:46:41.601 --> 00:46:42.600
Aaaah!

00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.899
Aah!

00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.700
Come here!
What did you do with Sue?

00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:48.200

00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:34.250
It's happening.
I knew it.

00:56:34.251 --> 00:56:35.600
You'll never take me alive!

00:56:35.601 --> 00:56:36.799
Aaaah!

00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:39.100
Ah!
She's scrambling my brain!

00:56:39.101 --> 00:56:40.400
I'll get her!

00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.399
Aaah!

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:46.000
Oh, no, you don't!
Not on my watch!

00:56:46.001 --> 00:56:47.600
Good work, sir!

00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:51.500
Good God!
The small ones have metal teeth!

00:56:51.501 --> 00:56:53.900
Jerry's kids, my ass!

00:56:54.700 --> 00:56:56.399
WILSON:
Mr. President!

00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.400
Mr. President, have you gone
completely insane?

00:56:59.401 --> 00:57:00.799
Like a fox.

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.000
We got to talk to the person
who saw this coming,

00:57:03.001 --> 00:57:04.000
Cindy Campbell.

00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.800
She knows how
to defeat the aliens.

00:57:05.801 --> 00:57:07.900
- Filthy, rotten scum!
- Aah!

00:57:07.901 --> 00:57:09.350
Aah!
You're hideous!

00:57:09.351 --> 00:57:10.799
Get off my planet!

00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:13.600
- No!
- Is everything all right?

00:57:13.601 --> 00:57:14.800
The exits are all blocked.

00:57:14.801 --> 00:57:16.700
I'll find one, sir.

00:57:16.701 --> 00:57:18.600
Everybody, clear!

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:23.399
This way, sir!
God, this is exciting!

00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.300
You're excited?
You should feel my nipples.

00:57:26.301 --> 00:57:27.999
Cody?

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.100
Cody?
Cody, where are you?

00:57:31.101 --> 00:57:32.199
Honey?

00:57:32.200 --> 00:57:34.400
GIGGINS: After today's incident
in the East Room,

00:57:34.401 --> 00:57:36.999
the White House
is now advising all citizens

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.700
to board up their homes and
prepare for an alien invasion.

00:57:40.701 --> 00:57:42.400
Oh, no.

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:44.999
And now a News 8 exclusive.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.200
The killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

00:57:47.201 --> 00:57:48.800
We're the only station
that has it,

00:57:48.900 --> 00:57:50.399
and we're showing it all night.

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.400
Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:58.800
There. Nobody's getting
through that sucker.

00:57:58.801 --> 00:58:01.200
But we have to get down
to the cellar.

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.150
- George.
- Cindy.

00:58:04.151 --> 00:58:05.900
There's no time.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.199
Cody.

00:58:07.200 --> 00:58:09.199
Thank God.
I've been worried sick.

00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.800
He showed up about an hour ago.
I tried to call.

00:58:11.801 --> 00:58:13.399
No, he didn't.

00:58:13.400 --> 00:58:15.400
Okay, but I was gonna.

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:17.199
No, he wasn't.

00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.700
Cody, the point is you can't
just run away like that.

00:58:20.701 --> 00:58:22.400
I wanted to be with George.

00:58:22.600 --> 00:58:25.200
Oh, honey, I know
you want a dad, but...

00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:28.200
Oh, trust me, Cody,
I'm not good at anything.

00:58:28.201 --> 00:58:29.600
Why would I be good at that?

00:58:29.601 --> 00:58:31.900
SUE:
Uncle George!

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:46.000
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

00:58:46.001 --> 00:58:48.399
I'm going to die, aren't I?

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.200
Cody, did I ever tell you
what your mom said

00:58:51.201 --> 00:58:53.200
about you
the day you were born?

00:58:53.201 --> 00:58:54.300
No.

00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.800
I was in the delivery room
with her.

00:58:56.801 --> 00:58:58.599
She was having a hard time.

00:58:58.600 --> 00:59:00.200
Then you began
to come out of her.

00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:03.200
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

00:59:03.201 --> 00:59:04.900
She yelled, "Just kill me.

00:59:04.901 --> 00:59:06.600
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:09.400
Whatever you do,
put me out of this pain."

00:59:09.401 --> 00:59:11.499
She was gushing
torrents of blood.

00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:14.200
I have this all on tape
if you want to see it someday.

00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:15.999
Well, finally you came out.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.800
Your mom cut
your umbilical cord herself.

00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:21.799
Well, on the second try.

00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.400
The first time she snipped
your penis in half.

00:59:24.401 --> 00:59:25.900
After all, she was drunk.

00:59:25.901 --> 00:59:27.200
Actually, drugged.

00:59:27.400 --> 00:59:30.400
We'd been out the night before
celebrating St. Patrick's Day.

00:59:30.401 --> 00:59:32.600
She thought, "Hey,
I never tasted crystal meth."

00:59:32.601 --> 00:59:34.400
So she did just a little.

00:59:34.500 --> 00:59:35.600
My penis?

00:59:35.601 --> 00:59:36.399
Yes.

00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:39.000
They sewed it on upside down.

00:59:39.001 --> 00:59:40.799
So that's why I pee up?

00:59:40.800 --> 00:59:42.199
Yes.
We'll get it fixed, honey.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:45.100
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

00:59:45.101 --> 00:59:46.799
Anyway, there you were.

00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:49.150
Your mom turned to me and said,

00:59:49.151 --> 00:59:51.500
"Hey, you want him?
Take him."

00:59:51.501 --> 00:59:53.050
Then she died.

00:59:53.051 --> 00:59:54.925
And I took you.

00:59:54.926 --> 00:59:56.799
Do you know why?

00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:58.399
I had just lost my cat
in a fire,

00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.300
and I needed something
to pet and feed.

01:00:00.301 --> 01:00:03.100
And I miss that cat, Cody.

01:00:03.101 --> 01:00:04.599
But I love you.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.699
And nothing's
ever gonna change that,

01:00:06.700 --> 01:00:09.200
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

01:00:09.201 --> 01:00:10.800
TOM:
George!

01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:14.000
[Banging]

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:19.599
Are they gone?

01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.800
I don't hear anything.

01:00:20.801 --> 01:00:22.000
[Banging]

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.600
[Screams effeminately]

01:00:28.601 --> 01:00:29.899
Don't worry, Sue.

01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:31.100
SUE:
It was Uncle George.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:33.800
Well, it's scary.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.200
Good work, Sue.

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.500
I don't know what stupid,
idiotic thing

01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:41.499
made these lights go off.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.000
All right, there's spare fuses
in the crawl space.

01:00:44.001 --> 01:00:45.500
I can get these lights back on.

01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:46.700
[Banging]

01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.200
Quick, George,
grab that railroad tie.

01:00:49.201 --> 01:00:50.800
Jam it against the door.

01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:52.400
- Oh!
- [Gasps]

01:00:52.401 --> 01:00:54.699
My balls!

01:00:54.700 --> 01:00:56.800
Oh!
Not those!

01:00:56.801 --> 01:00:58.200
Jesus!

01:00:58.201 --> 01:00:59.600
No!

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.600
SUE:
Uncle George!

01:01:01.601 --> 01:01:02.999
I'm scared!

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.800
Oh, sweetie, come here.
It's okay.

01:01:05.801 --> 01:01:07.399
Aah!

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:10.400
There's something
on the other side of the door.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.200
I can't see anything.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.400
Oh, my God.

01:01:41.500 --> 01:01:43.050
Can you see them?

01:01:43.051 --> 01:01:44.599
They're horrible.

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:46.700
They're grayish
with big black eyes.

01:01:46.701 --> 01:01:48.400
Their teeth are grotesque.

01:01:48.401 --> 01:01:49.999
[Trilling]

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.400
- I think they're giggling.
- What?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Oh, no.

01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:57.499
Oh, no, I think...

01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:00.000
- I think they want...
- [Banging]

01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:03.099
Aaah!
Help!

01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.700
Cody!
Oh, my God!

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:07.099
George.
Swing away, George.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:09.000
- Aah! Aunt Cindy, help!
- I'm coming, Cody.

01:02:09.001 --> 01:02:10.400
I'll save you.

01:02:10.401 --> 01:02:11.800
- Ugh!
- Die!

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:15.600
Die!

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.650
You damn aliens, let him go!

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.525
You're not getting in here!

01:02:19.526 --> 01:02:21.400
- What else you got?
- George.

01:02:21.401 --> 01:02:23.499
There!
Had enough?

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.000
Yeah. Forget it, Cody.
Thank me later.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:27.800
Oh, Cody.
Oh, thank God.

01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:28.850
Come on.

01:02:28.851 --> 01:02:29.800
SUE:
Daddy!

01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.200
- Daddy!
- Sue!

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.200
Oh!

01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:37.499
Mahalik,
what are you doing here?

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.050
I told you the hood's
always got your back.

01:02:40.051 --> 01:02:42.600
Thank God.
There's two of them at the door.

01:02:42.601 --> 01:02:43.400
They're gone.

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.450
Good.
They couldn't get in.

01:02:46.451 --> 01:02:48.175
I hear they can't open doors.

01:02:48.176 --> 01:02:49.899
They mastered space flight,

01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:51.950
but they can't get
through a wooden door?

01:02:51.951 --> 01:02:54.000
Oh, look, the cellar's
the safest place.

01:02:54.001 --> 01:02:55.900
Women and children stay here.

01:02:55.901 --> 01:02:57.800
- Ugh!
- All right, and the men,

01:02:57.801 --> 01:02:59.199
we go outside and fight.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.800
Right. And what's
the cutoff age for children?

01:03:01.801 --> 01:03:03.250
Come on!

01:03:03.251 --> 01:03:04.700
[Groans]

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.799
[Rustling]

01:03:16.800 --> 01:03:19.200
- [Shovel cocks]
- Follow me.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.200
[Tires screeching]

01:03:31.800 --> 01:03:32.799
I'm sorry.

01:03:32.800 --> 01:03:35.200
I thought
I was hitting the brake.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:38.200
Now, we don't have to go
through insurance, do we?

01:03:38.201 --> 01:03:40.200
Mr. President,
what are you doing here?

01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:41.599
I'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:43.999
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Ah, good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:51.900
We don't have round planes, sir.

01:03:51.901 --> 01:03:53.350
Oh, my God.

01:03:53.351 --> 01:03:54.800
Oh, my God.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
- [Hip-hop music plays]
- Wait. Do you hear that?

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:00.400
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:04:00.401 --> 01:04:02.800
<i>Ah, ah, ah, ah</i>

01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:06.000
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.199
- Yo, what's up, George?
- C.J.!

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.900
I told you the 'hood
always got your back.

01:04:11.901 --> 01:04:14.600
I got the boys with me.
Get out the car, man.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:15.500
Who we gonna shoot?

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.800
Is y'all ready to go step?

01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.150
Let's go do this,
'cause I'm hyped right now!

01:04:19.151 --> 01:04:21.400
- Real hyped!
- You stepped on my shoe, bitch!

01:04:21.401 --> 01:04:22.400
Call me "bitch" again,

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:25.500
and I'll park your truck
dead in your ass.

01:04:25.501 --> 01:04:26.199
Damn, homey!

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:28.599
- In the cornfield.
- They're coming!

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:30.700
Me and my boys,
we gonna take care of this.

01:04:30.701 --> 01:04:32.000
Come on, let's go.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:34.199
Son, I'd bust
this shit right now.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.899
- Your mama!
- I got your number, homey.

01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:38.000
- We over here, y'all!
- He ain't gonna bust nothing.

01:04:38.001 --> 01:04:39.200
I got nuts bigger than him.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.199
Whoa, country-ass,
maple-syrup nigga.

01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.500
Yeah, you want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:48.800
Get down!
Get down!

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
I can't believe what I just saw.

01:04:58.001 --> 01:04:59.999
These men died
for their country.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:03.200
Send flowers
to their bitches and hos.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.499
I can't break free!

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:13.200
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:17.650
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:05:17.651 --> 01:05:18.600
I found it!

01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:20.600
Without their heads,
they're powerless!

01:05:20.601 --> 01:05:22.399
Please, no.
We mean you no harm.

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:25.200
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:28.150
We must destroy her
before seven days.

01:05:28.151 --> 01:05:30.999
You mean you watched
the videotape?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.500
Our satellite picked up what
we thought was "Pootie Tang."

01:05:33.501 --> 01:05:34.800
That was a week ago.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:40.000
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:42.999
Oh, see?
They are peaceful.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
If they're so peaceful,
why were they choking us?

01:05:46.100 --> 01:05:48.050
Oh, that's how we say hello.

01:05:48.051 --> 01:05:50.000
- Hello!
- Nice to see you.

01:05:50.001 --> 01:05:51.999
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.900
Well, how do you guys
say goodbye?

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.199
Oh!

01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:57.799
[Groans]
I had to ask.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:02.700
If you think that's strange,
you should see how we pee.

01:06:02.701 --> 01:06:05.100
[Choking]

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.600
So we're not so different
after all.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.900
There's something
about this place.

01:06:15.901 --> 01:06:18.400
It's like I've seen it before.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.000
Oh, my God.

01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:27.400
This used to be their farm.

01:06:27.401 --> 01:06:29.200
She died right here.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.500
There's something down there.

01:06:55.600 --> 01:06:57.200
Ugh!

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.000
Hey, awesome.
Yeah, you got it.

01:07:12.001 --> 01:07:13.100
Just look at this.

01:07:13.200 --> 01:07:16.400
Human beings and aliens
working together.

01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:19.800
We're all just
one big galactic family.

01:07:19.801 --> 01:07:21.599
Family.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.600
That's just what
I've been running away from.

01:07:23.601 --> 01:07:26.800
Well, that's because
you're an idiot.

01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:38.199
This is it.

01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:40.300
ARCHITECT: My wife took her
to the family farm

01:07:40.301 --> 01:07:42.400
and drowned her in the well.

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:50.400
The little girl.
She's frightened of the well.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:54.800
[Gasps]

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:08.699
Aah!

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.200
- Ugh!
- Cindy!

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.400
[Crowbar clanks]

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.100
[Chainsaw sputters, buzzes]

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.000
Time to go back
down the well, bitch.

01:08:49.001 --> 01:08:50.700
[Growling]

01:08:50.701 --> 01:08:52.399
Cindy!

01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:55.200
No.
Don't hurt him!

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.499
Cindy, come outside.

01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.100
- The aliens aren't invading.
- Aah!

01:08:59.101 --> 01:09:00.699
Aah!

01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:02.400
Don't worry, Cody.
I'll save you.

01:09:02.401 --> 01:09:04.300
- Aah!
- CINDY: Wait!

01:09:04.301 --> 01:09:06.199
Wait.
Don't do this.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:08.400
You don't have to be evil.

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:12.800
I know what happened
to you, Tabitha.

01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:16.800
I know what your mom did.
That was wrong.

01:09:16.801 --> 01:09:18.399
You were just a little girl.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.400
You're still that little girl,
just a lot more corpsy

01:09:22.401 --> 01:09:24.800
and with really bad teeth.

01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:28.800
But maybe all you need
is a mother.

01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.000
And a father.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:47.400
We could be...

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.500
A family.

01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.599
Thank you all.

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:59.000
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:00.700
I'll never have to kill again.

01:10:00.701 --> 01:10:02.300
Really?

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:06.000
Nah!
I'm just screwing with you!

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.999
[Grunts]
Aah!

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.900
I just want to tell you both
good luck.

01:10:09.901 --> 01:10:11.800
- We're all counting on you.
- [Splash]

01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.700
Now it's over.

01:10:21.701 --> 01:10:23.000
- [Gasps]
- Aah!

01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:24.700
Oh, no, no, it's okay.

01:10:24.701 --> 01:10:26.199
He's our friend.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:28.199
Thank you for saving
our species.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.000
Now we must return
to our home planet.

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.400
Goodbye, then.

01:10:31.401 --> 01:10:32.300
Ugh!

01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:33.900
Goodbye.

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:54.199
Hey, congratulations, George!

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:56.000
You know the 'hood
always got your back.

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:57.600
Yeah, yeah!

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.100
Come on!

01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.550
Bye!

01:11:04.551 --> 01:11:05.899
Whoo!

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.800
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:19.500
ALL: Bye!

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.100
Oh, George, I'm so happy.

01:11:22.101 --> 01:11:24.950
Finally we're a family.

01:11:24.951 --> 01:11:27.800
Yeah.
You, me, and...

01:11:27.801 --> 01:11:28.600
- Damn!
- Damn!

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:30.750
[Tires screeching]

01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:32.800
Cindy, George, wait!

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.500
[Sighs]

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.200

<i>When he spoke,

<i>My first thought's
to slap him up, but I'm grown</i>

01:11:54.100 --> 01:11:55.600
<i>So I dropped a jewel
in his ear</i>

01:11:55.601 --> 01:11:57.099
<i>Told him get on,
leave it alone</i>

01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:59.400
<i>Now he's asking questions he
shoulda asked from the start</i>

01:11:59.500 --> 01:12:01.899
<i>I'm gonna spit from the
heart, spit till it's dark</i>

01:12:01.900 --> 01:12:04.000
<i>From the stage in the park,
I'm gonna bite if you bark</i>

01:12:04.001 --> 01:12:05.799
<i>Just to show him
that it's fun to me</i>

01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:07.900
<i>And take a look at what

01:12:07.901 --> 01:12:10.199
<i>I am the truth,
