this little baby's gonna stay right here.

Fuck, fuck.

Look away.

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:29.555
Look...

00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:33.672
- You know there's a mirror here, right?
- Close your eyes.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.479
Fucking damn it. Forget it.
You know what? Turn around.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.756
- Can I open my eyes?
- Yeah, open your eyes.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.112
What do you want?

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.430

So you think these guys
are gonna hurt Amelia?

00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.512
Sure, after they're done killing her.

00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:02.598
You know, I asked around about you.

00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.336
There's a couple of people I trust
say you're pretty good at this.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.120
Well, that's surprising.
I would have thought

00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:09.879
your job ended with
breaking my fucking arm.

00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.816
(CHUCKLES) Well, you know,
technically it did.

00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:12.840

Well, no.

No, she paid me up front,
actually, you know.

and I don't wanna move.

But, yeah, she died in a crash

to clean out the place,

She sees her get in her car.

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:45.678
- She sees her drive away.
- Bullshit.

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.916
Bullshit's right.
She's dead and then she's alive.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.280
That's what I'm talking about.

It's very fucking complicated.

But I persevere, you know.

00:24:53.560 --> 00:24:56.472
I run the tape through and I think,
"Okay, maybe there was a girl there."

Amelia? The old lady saw Amelia?

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.355

to show up for class.

Burbank Airport. Western flight D.

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.119

a couple of days, call Kuttner

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:19.159
and see if we can squeeze
a second instalment out of her.

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.197

HOLLY: <i>You don't wanna call too soon.</i>

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:27.029
Gotta act like you're onto something,
like you've been working hard.

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:31.591
Then, day three, ask for more money.

01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.597
Well, she's putting a negative spin on it,
but, yeah, that's the idea.

01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.591
Kuttner paid us. Me.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.318
She paid me to do a job, right?

01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.750
- I'm not gonna lie to her.
- I respect that.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.672
That's why I'll lie to her.

01:04:43.840 --> 01:04:47.753

for a detective.

'Course, you're not gonna
find her at the airport,

01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.513
seeing as how it's not a flight.

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.911
- Did he stop?
- Yeah.

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:04.277

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:20.072
it's probably "flat," like apartment.

She's having a guy over.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:42.160
Your sister's such a slut.

01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.918
JESSICA: Yeah, I know.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.429
Hello?

01:12:49.120 --> 01:12:50.553
<i>Amelia.</i>

01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.955
Should you shake her shoulder? Maybe...

01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.951
You know, my brother used to flick my ear.

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.269
Like that. I hated that.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:57.696
- We shouldn't be violent.
- You got a brother?

01:12:57.720 --> 01:12:58.856
- You could just hit her.
- Yeah.

01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:00.000
- Really?
- Like really hard.

01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.376
- I've got a family.
- HOLLY: It's not practical.

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:04.392
JACKSON: <i>We probably shouldn't hit her
if we want her to talk to us.</i>

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:06.152
It's okay.

01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.096
You were supposed
to get those guys off of me.

01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.816
Do you know who they were?
Do you know who sent them?

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.638
Yeah. It was my mother.

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:21.673
Would you mind starting
from the top because...

01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:24.912
- Why? It doesn't matter.
- I'm sorry, it doesn't matter?

01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.036
You just shot at us. I think it matters.

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.031
Okay, okay. I made a film.

01:13:29.200 --> 01:13:31.555
I made a film with Dean, my boyfriend.

01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.560
And the idea was
that we were gonna, you know,

01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:39.237
like make this experimental film,
like an artistic film.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.675
- Porno film.
- It's not a porno.

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:44.720
(SIGHS)

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.951
Look, do you even know who my mother is?

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.758
Yes, we do.

01:13:48.920 --> 01:13:51.036
We've actually met your mother.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:52.936
(SCOFFING) What did she tell you,
that I'm crazy?

01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:55.235
(STAMMERS) That I was just lashing out?

01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.696
Something like that.
She might have mentioned...

01:13:56.720 --> 01:14:00.156
Yeah, well, my mother is a criminal.

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.548
She's one of them.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.039
Who's them? What's them?

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:04.633
AMELIA: <i>One of the insiders.</i>

01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:08.270
One of the capitalist,
corporate suppressors.

01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:09.736
You know, they want us dead, man!

01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.376
We're just in their crosshairs, you know!

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:12.469
We're just pawns!

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:13.640
Gosh.

01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:15.040
(SIGHS) Ow.

01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:17.112
Hey. (WHISTLES SLOWLY)

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.911
And what does this
have to do with the birds?

01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.274
JACKSON: <i>Yeah.</i>

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.440
My mom's supposed to be working
for the Justice Department, right?

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.790
Sure, she's prosecuting
the catalytic converter case.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.679
Yeah, only she's not.
She's not prosecuting it.

01:14:30.840 --> 01:14:32.831
The auto makers, she's gonna let 'em walk.

01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.200
- But they have the evidence.
- Yes, they have evidence.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:36.673
They have memos proving that

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:39.149
Detroit conspired
to suppress the converter,

01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:40.320
proving they would rather

01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:42.296
poison our air than spend
a little bit of money.

01:14:42.320 --> 01:14:43.976
But my mom, she's gonna say
that's not enough.

01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.514
She's gonna lie because...
Because she's on the take.

01:14:46.680 --> 01:14:49.148
Money again, right?
Mammon, that's her god.

01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:51.390
That fascist crony...

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.560
- Okay, okay.
- ...bogart!

01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:55.439
All right, all right,
just back up a little bit.

01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:56.600
(SIGHS)

01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:58.336
Why not just go straight to the police?

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.998
(LAUGHING) She is the police.

01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.310
She's the head of the Justice Department.

01:15:02.480 --> 01:15:03.674
You've got a point.

01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.840
Okay, or the newspaper?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.399
They all work together.

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:08.636
God, have you been living under a rock?

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:13.749
All right, so then your solution
was you make a porn film.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.069
(SIGHS) It's not a porno!

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.720
HOLLAND: <i>You know, I have neighbors.</i>

01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:18.320
- I made a statement.
- JACKSON: <i>Right.</i>

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:21.716
And yeah, yeah,
my statement contained nudity.

01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:23.040
- Porno nudity.
- AMELIA: <i>Art.</i>

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.475
That's just the commercial element, okay?

01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.710
Okay? Sid said we had to have that.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.348
And the reality was
we were getting our message out there.

01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:32.511
And it was all in the film,

01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:36.070
names and dates and everything,
everything that my mom was doing,

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:38.240
and once it was out there,
once it was in theaters,

01:15:38.360 --> 01:15:39.496
there's no way that
they could suppress it.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:42.353
There's no way
that they could cover it up.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.000
HOLLAND: So let me get this straight.

01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:46.913
You made a porno film
where the point was the plot?

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:48.593
(SIGHS) What's your hang-up, man?

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.113
JACKSON: It's not the sex.

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.475
It's what's in the story.

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.631
My mom found out.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:57.400
(SIGHS)

01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.995
She killed Dean and destroyed the film.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:01.758
Your mom killed Dean?

01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.273
Of course.

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:05.673
She killed Misty, too.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.558
And Sid Shattuck?

01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.189
Yeah.

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:11.720
Okay, so it's like Jack the Ripper

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:14.832
- and then your mom, basically.
- (SIGHS)

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.474
So what are you gonna do?

01:16:16.640 --> 01:16:17.868
AMELIA: I don't know.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:21.835
I'm just really tired, you know.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.753
Uh, all right, okay. So, uh, you...

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:29.230
We're just gonna talk about it and
we'll think and you get some rest.

01:16:29.400 --> 01:16:31.118
Yeah, just get some rest.

01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:38.398
What do you think?

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.834
I like her.

01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:41.000
I like her dress.

01:16:41.200 --> 01:16:42.394
It's a nice dress.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:44.198
But she's a loon.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:46.671
According to her,
her mother's single-handedly

01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:49.149
gonna wipe out all of Western society.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.197
Well, yeah.

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.433
However, there are people
trying to kill her, right?

01:16:55.600 --> 01:16:57.795
- Like John Boy.
- Who's John Boy?

01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:59.678
He's on <i>The Waltons.</i>

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.199
No, different John Boy.

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.509
Well, we think.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.517
Think, yeah. Pretty sure.

01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:07.280
- (TELEPHONE RINGING)
- Can't be sure, though. Yeah.

01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:11.349
Mr. March, I just got a call from Judith.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:13.357
She didn't explain herself.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:16.677
Said she needed $100,000 in cash.

01:17:16.840 --> 01:17:18.717
- $100,000? Why?
- TALLY: <i>I don't know.</i>

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.350
I think she's involved
in something shady maybe.

01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:24.636
Well, her daughter
certainly seems to think so.

01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.791
What, Amelia? You found Amelia?

01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:27.960
HOLLAND: <i>Yes.</i>

01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:29.798
She fell on our car.

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:31.837
We were just talking
and she fell on our car.

01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:33.680
Anyway, she's here. You should come over.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:36.229
I'll send the family doctor.

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560
(SIGHS)

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:38.909
Okay, look,

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:41.196
<i>- Mr. March...</i>
- Holland, please.

01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:43.635
<i>I've got a bad feeling about this.</i>

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:48.595
Would you be willing
to carry the money for me?

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:59.231
I wish I knew who to believe on this one.

01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:01.590
Well, the kid's a write-off,
I'll tell you that much.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.558
Maybe they're both telling the truth.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.597
HOLLAND: We're downstairs.

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:09.999
She's coming down.

01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.856
What do you mean,
they're both telling the truth?

01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:15.108
What the fuck does that mean?

01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:17.510
I got a friend, right?

01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.750
Secret Service. Worked the Nixon detail.

01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:22.520
This was after
they threw him out of office.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:24.600
No. Anyway, you know,

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.776
Nixon's driving around
one day around San Clemente.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:27.994
Just him and a few agents.

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:29.160
Yeah.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:31.550
And they come across
this car accident, right?

01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:33.870
There's a guy pinned under a car.

01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:38.192
Anyway, Nixon gets out,
runs over to check on the guy,

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.197
you know, leans down,
and Nixon says to him,

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:43.631
"You're gonna be okay, son.
You're gonna be all right."

01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:46.473
And right then the guy dies.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:50.508
I don't get it.

01:18:50.680 --> 01:18:52.910
Think about it
from that guy's point of view, okay?

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:54.235
The guy who died.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.312
He's lying there on the ground,
staring up at the sky, near death,

01:18:57.480 --> 01:18:59.696
and then former president,
Richard Nixon, appears before him

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.040
and tells him he's gonna be fine.

01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.833
Now, did he think that's normal, right,

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.833
that before they die everybody sees Nixon?

01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.752
You're expecting an angel
and you get Nixon.

01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:10.399
- Exactly. Right?
- Yeah.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:13.313
It's the same situation,
just a vastly different point of view.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.675
- So there's two ways to look at something.
- Yeah.

01:19:15.840 --> 01:19:17.296
- That's the point of the story?
- Yeah.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.038
- Yeah, just say that.
- What?

01:19:19.200 --> 01:19:21.656
Well, you just lead me on this
epic fucking journey with this story

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:22.896
and 10 minutes later the point is

01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:24.496
that there's two ways
to look at something.

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:26.351
Just... You could just say that.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.748
You didn't like that story?

01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:31.880
- That would be awful.
- Wouldn't it, right?

01:19:31.920 --> 01:19:33.672
- Yeah.
- It would suck, right?

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.034
- Oh.
- HOLLAND: <i>Hey.</i>

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:36.428
Thank God.

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.512
$100,000. Packed it myself.

01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.908
Just...

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.673
It's not common you find
such nice people in the world.

01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960
(LAUGHS)

01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.040
I'm sorry about him.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:52.156
He just wanted to come along.
I don't know why.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:55.710
But I'll call you, you know,
when we make the drop.

01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:58.868
Thank you.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.959
HOLLAND: Are you nervous at all?

01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:05.394
Me? No.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:07.394
I got insurance.

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:09.312
This baby right here.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.959
HOLLAND: <i>Is that an ankle gun?</i>

01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.673
That is an ankle gun, yeah.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.229
- That's pretty sweet.
- Uh-huh.

01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:18.237
I'm falling asleep at the wheel here, man.

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:19.719
I'm gonna need you to drive.

01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:22.030
<i>I'm gonna pull over up here.</i>
