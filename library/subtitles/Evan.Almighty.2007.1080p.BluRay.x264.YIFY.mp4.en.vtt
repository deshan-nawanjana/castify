WEBVTT

00:01:08.102 --> 00:01:09.211
And that's the news.

00:01:09.311 --> 00:01:14.751
But before we sign off, we'd like
to congratulate our very own Evan Baxter,

00:01:14.786 --> 00:01:18.112
who has just been elected
Buffalo's representative to Congress.

00:01:18.653 --> 00:01:20.428
And, now, we have
a surprise for Evan.

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:21.213
- No, you don't.
- We do.

00:01:21.213 --> 00:01:24.113
Oh, no. I really
didn't expect this.

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:27.210
Here's a look back
at his run for office.

00:01:29.453 --> 00:01:30.755
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:32.666
<i>Change the world!</i>

00:01:32.701 --> 00:01:33.857
<i>That's right!</i>

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:42.780
<i>Baxter! Baxter! Baxter!</i>

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:50.343
<i>Hi.</i>

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:51.618
<i>Baxter! Baxter!</i>

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:53.429
<i>That's right!</i>

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:02.737
I feel like that old Indian
in front of all the garbage.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.343
So, for the last time, this is Evan Baxter
for "Eyewitness News". Good night.

00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:28.844
<i>Huntsville, Virginia.
Prestige Crest, four miles.</i>

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.503
What did we do
before GPS?

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:31.375
Nothing.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.722
Guys, dad's very proud of
his new car.

00:02:33.814 --> 00:02:38.450
He-hey, I am proud of my new car.
Look, I'm a politician now.

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.308
I'm in the public eye, and as you know,
when you are in the public eye,

00:02:41.308 --> 00:02:43.188
image is everything,
isn't it?

00:02:47.976 --> 00:02:50.681
Here it is!
Welcome to the good life.

00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:54.476
Hey, guys, why the long faces?
We're off on a new adventure!

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.434
It's just we're gonna
miss our friends.

00:02:57.531 --> 00:02:59.479
You'll make new friends,
better friends.

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:00.738
Yeah, richer friends.

00:03:00.738 --> 00:03:04.559
Do not mouth off to me, sir.
I am the boss of you.

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:07.264
And let me tell you something,
you guys are gonna love this place.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.123
Oh, and you know what? I think there's
something for our fishermen up there.

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:15.247
Baxter family,
this is what's called a scenic vista.

00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:19.316
And I don't think the big man himself
could do a better job. Pretty cool, huh?

00:03:19.351 --> 00:03:21.952
Hey, dad, an iguana can
stay underwater for 28 minutes.

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:22.310
What's that?

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.027
- And a shrimp's heart is in its head.
- Really?

00:03:24.048 --> 00:03:26.355
Okay, someone's had enough
"Animal Planet" for one lifetime.

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:28.291
Yeah, let's head out! Come on.
The best is yet to come!

00:03:30.092 --> 00:03:32.855
Gentlemen, I have saved
the best for last.

00:03:33.045 --> 00:03:36.721
Look over to the right.
That... is your new home.

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:43.728
Whoa!

00:03:43.728 --> 00:03:44.918
That's our house?

00:03:44.918 --> 00:03:46.210
- Uh-huh.
- I don't remember it being

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.526
this big in the brochure.
Was it this big in the brochure?

00:03:48.526 --> 00:03:49.441
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.590
There they are!

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.254
Is this curb appeal or what?

00:03:55.254 --> 00:03:56.484
Here we go!

00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:58.729
Ooh, honey, I think
you're blocking my photo.

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:59.294
Sorry.

00:03:59.294 --> 00:04:01.643
All right, everybody!
Say "escrow"!

00:04:01.643 --> 00:04:04.905
Escrow!

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.383
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Go. Go. Go.

00:04:07.938 --> 00:04:09.932
Guys, easy.

00:04:12.356 --> 00:04:13.880
This is our house?

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:14.906
Uh-huh.

00:04:15.501 --> 00:04:16.524
Careful!

00:04:16.905 --> 00:04:18.700
- Oh, honey, be careful!
- Watch it!

00:04:18.735 --> 00:04:19.817
Are you kidding me?

00:04:19.852 --> 00:04:21.114
- Mom, can we go upstairs?
- Yep.

00:04:21.114 --> 00:04:22.515
- And I get my own room, right?
- Yep.

00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:26.891
Mr. Baxter, could you give us some
direction on these kitchen cabinets?

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:27.828
Sure.

00:04:27.913 --> 00:04:32.283
Okay, it's between your maple
and your old-growth Brazilian cherry.

00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:34.290
Ooh, that is nice!
Which is best?

00:04:34.363 --> 00:04:37.437
Well, if you're not sensitive
to that "save the rainforest" stuff,

00:04:37.437 --> 00:04:39.014
you can't beat
the Brazilian cherry.

00:04:39.014 --> 00:04:40.335
It's two-three hundred years old.

00:04:40.335 --> 00:04:41.765
- Three hundred years.
- Three hundred.

00:04:41.765 --> 00:04:43.118
Wow. That is old.

00:04:43.401 --> 00:04:45.891
And now you are going
to hold my dishes.

00:04:45.963 --> 00:04:47.668
- That's right. You going with the cherry?
- Cheery cherry!

00:04:47.668 --> 00:04:49.376
- Yeah. Definitely.
- He's going with the cherry!

00:04:50.423 --> 00:04:51.241
Dad, look!

00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:52.801
Oh. No. No, no, no, no! No.

00:04:52.801 --> 00:04:55.082
Ryan, do not touch him, please!

00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:57.027
Oh, no, no, no, no,
get him away!

00:04:57.027 --> 00:04:59.452
No. He might have lice, fleas,
maggots or something.

00:04:59.452 --> 00:05:01.529
You do not play with stray dogs
because they are very...

00:05:01.653 --> 00:05:04.276
Ooh! No, no!
Get away, get away! Go!

00:05:05.128 --> 00:05:06.870
Okay. Oh, no, no, no.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.061
- He's thirsty.
- No, no, no.

00:05:08.096 --> 00:05:11.323
No, you don't!
There we go.

00:05:11.358 --> 00:05:12.874
Well, Ryan, he's a stray.

00:05:12.874 --> 00:05:14.525
If we give him water,
he's just going to come back.

00:05:14.525 --> 00:05:18.100
Come on, dad, why can't we keep him?
I mean, we've got a new house.

00:05:18.135 --> 00:05:20.044
Okay, Ryan, this is why
we can't keep him.

00:05:20.079 --> 00:05:22.808
They are stinky. They are smelly.
They get hair all over the place.

00:05:22.808 --> 00:05:24.024
They get a little thing
called the mange.

00:05:24.024 --> 00:05:27.056
In a nutshell, he is disgusting.
Case in point.

00:05:32.038 --> 00:05:35.153
Ladies and gentlemen,
this concludes day one

00:05:35.153 --> 00:05:36.935
of the Baxters'
new and exciting life.

00:05:36.967 --> 00:05:38.879
I have to do
the new house dance.

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:41.561
Wow! That dance?

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.054
- Mmm-hmm.
- That's a good new house dance.

00:05:43.154 --> 00:05:44.454
Thank you.

00:05:44.982 --> 00:05:47.231
You know, those boys were having
so much fun tonight,

00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:49.048
I thought I would never
get them to bed.

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:54.133
And then Ryan did the cutest thing.
He asked if we could all pray together.

00:05:57.045 --> 00:05:57.118
Really? What, uh,
what did you pray about?

00:05:57.153 --> 00:05:59.197
He met a dog.
What do you think he prayed for?

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:03.954
Just a walking petri dish,
that dog.

00:06:03.983 --> 00:06:06.138
And Jordan was very precise.

00:06:06.138 --> 00:06:10.163
He prayed for... good visibility,
good weather on the hiking trip tomorrow.

00:06:10.177 --> 00:06:13.691
The hiking trip? Oh, right. Yeah.
The hiking trip. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:06:13.691 --> 00:06:15.340
You wanna know
what I prayed for?

00:06:15.436 --> 00:06:17.236
Yeah. What did you pray for?

00:06:17.595 --> 00:06:21.064
I prayed we would
become closer as a family.

00:06:21.532 --> 00:06:26.446
Honey, you don't need to pray for that
to happen. I will make that happen.

00:06:27.693 --> 00:06:29.166
What would you pray for?

00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:32.275
Me? I don't know.
Praying just...

00:06:33.806 --> 00:06:37.893
Honey, you're the one who said
you wanted to change the world.

00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:40.251
It's a pretty big job.

00:06:40.417 --> 00:06:42.953
If it were me,
I would take all the help I could get.

00:06:48.303 --> 00:06:51.388
<i>Former Buffalo News anchor,
Evan Baxter, takes office tomorrow</i>

00:06:51.388 --> 00:06:53.833
<i>to make good on
a lofty campaign promise.</i>

00:06:53.833 --> 00:06:54.985
<i>What are we gonna do?</i>

00:06:54.985 --> 00:06:56.375
<i>Change the world!</i>

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.112
<i>Good luck, Congressman.
Many have tried, many have failed.</i>

00:07:00.147 --> 00:07:00.766
<i>Hello!</i>

00:07:00.766 --> 00:07:02.872
<i>This is Regina Sparks
reporting for NS...</i>

00:07:20.538 --> 00:07:22.691
Hello, there. Hi.

00:07:23.337 --> 00:07:25.898
This is Evan... Baxter.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.880
Um... Just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.937
Thank you for the new car
and for the house.

00:07:33.937 --> 00:07:36.770
The house is great.
Um, love it.

00:07:37.351 --> 00:07:42.086
I mean, I picked it out, but...
you created matter and everything, so...

00:07:43.917 --> 00:07:49.132
Um... I just wanted to say that I think
Joan makes a good point,

00:07:49.132 --> 00:07:53.877
and... that I am now
in a position of great power,

00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:58.061
and I know that with great power
comes great responsibility.

00:07:59.864 --> 00:08:02.009
So, God,

00:08:05.829 --> 00:08:08.683
please help me
change the world.

00:08:10.155 --> 00:08:13.333
Okay. That's it.
I'm hanging up now.

00:08:13.921 --> 00:08:16.446
God bless... well, you. Okay.

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:41.557
What? That's weird.

00:08:41.847 --> 00:08:42.783
What?

00:08:42.818 --> 00:08:44.522
I set the alarm for 7:00.

00:09:18.709 --> 00:09:20.718
I am successful. I am powerful.
I am handsome.

00:09:20.718 --> 00:09:23.280
I am happy, successful,
powerful, handsome, happy.

00:09:29.618 --> 00:09:29.635
All right, everyone, wish me luck.
The Congressman has left the building.

00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:34.422
All right, Baxter brood, I will see you
later on this afternoon for the big hike. Huh? Yes?

00:09:34.912 --> 00:09:36.278
You psyched? Are you ready?

00:09:36.442 --> 00:09:36.990
Yeah.

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:37.891
- Bye.
- Good luck, honey.

00:09:37.991 --> 00:09:39.613
- See ya. Bye, guys!
- See you later.

00:09:39.613 --> 00:09:40.796
Later, gator.

00:09:42.292 --> 00:09:44.044
Oh, gosh.

00:09:44.073 --> 00:09:46.786
Wow. Honey,
did you order anything?

00:09:47.169 --> 00:09:49.191
"Alpha and Omega Hardware"?

00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:50.005
Never heard of them.

00:09:50.005 --> 00:09:51.082
Me either.

00:09:52.351 --> 00:09:53.916
What do we have?

00:09:55.389 --> 00:09:56.804
What is this stuff?

00:09:58.611 --> 00:10:00.248
Must have the wrong address.

00:10:00.826 --> 00:10:03.046
Yup. The wrong address.

00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:07.534
- Congressman Baxter. Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:10:07.669 --> 00:10:09.192
- Good morning, Congressman Baxter.
- Hello.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.327
- Good morning, Congressman Baxter.
- Good morning.

00:10:11.937 --> 00:10:15.166
Oh, this is so cool.

00:10:16.894 --> 00:10:17.843
Uh-huh.

00:10:17.855 --> 00:10:19.917
Yeah. This'll work.

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:23.846
There he is! The head honcho.
The big kahuna.

00:10:23.846 --> 00:10:25.752
Rita, I think
I have to do the dance.

00:10:25.787 --> 00:10:27.084
Do the dance.

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:31.985
That's enough
of the dance.

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.420
Oh, this is nice!
This is really nice!

00:10:34.455 --> 00:10:36.532
This is too nice.
There's something crooked going on.

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.327
Do you smell anthrax?

00:10:38.362 --> 00:10:40.020
- Congressman!
- Hey, Marty!

00:10:40.020 --> 00:10:41.735
Ooh. Nice sound to that.
I like it.

00:10:41.770 --> 00:10:42.568
Here they are!

00:10:43.629 --> 00:10:44.850
All right.

00:10:44.885 --> 00:10:46.524
You remember Sarah,
Allen, Michael.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:48.720
I don't think you know the new kid
Eugene Tennanbaum.

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:49.716
I found him at G.W.

00:10:49.716 --> 00:10:53.175
Sort of a walking search engine. Watch this.
How many stars on the flag in 1818?

00:10:53.175 --> 00:10:53.685
15.

00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:55.811
And Congressman Baxter's
coffee habits?

00:10:55.811 --> 00:10:58.934
He likes a morning latte with a cruller,
a decaf espresso after lunch,

00:10:58.934 --> 00:11:00.836
served sans pastry of any kind.

00:11:00.836 --> 00:11:03.236
Very impressive. A little freaky,
but I like this kid.

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.015
I love you.

00:11:05.877 --> 00:11:06.905
Hmm?

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:10.951
I mean, we should hang out socially.
I just got a ping-pong table.

00:11:10.951 --> 00:11:12.524
Not... going to happen.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:16.012
Go find out where his license plates are.
Everybody else, back to your holes.

00:11:16.012 --> 00:11:16.607
He was actually right.

00:11:16.707 --> 00:11:18.862
I'm doing
a background check on that kid.

00:11:18.927 --> 00:11:23.801
Ta-da! This, my friend, is a power office,
to remind you of the mission!

00:11:23.801 --> 00:11:25.170
"Change the world!"

00:11:25.170 --> 00:11:27.131
Okay, Evan, who do you know?
- What do you mean?

00:11:27.131 --> 00:11:29.129
Oh, come on.
Yesterday we're in the basement.

00:11:29.129 --> 00:11:30.991
Today, look at this place.
It's like the Emerald City!

00:11:31.026 --> 00:11:34.433
"Enjoy your office.
Your neighbor, Congressman Long."

00:11:34.468 --> 00:11:36.638
Congressman Long did thi...?
Did you say "neighbor"?

00:11:36.673 --> 00:11:39.581
That's right. He lives in Prestige Crest,
right up the street.

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:43.413
Evan, you gotta tell me these things.
Think of the publicity angle on this!

00:11:43.448 --> 00:11:45.937
You and Congressman Long
having a barbecue.

00:11:45.972 --> 00:11:48.011
Congressman Long
eating your hot dog.

00:11:48.046 --> 00:11:49.662
Hate to break up
your little weenie roast.

00:11:49.697 --> 00:11:52.302
Congressman Long's assistant
just dropped this off.

00:11:52.337 --> 00:11:53.413
The Congressman
would like for you

00:11:53.513 --> 00:11:56.186
to junior cosponsor this bill
that he's introducing.

00:11:56.186 --> 00:12:00.471
Hold on. Congressman Long asked us to
junior cosponsor his bill? What's the bill?

00:12:00.506 --> 00:12:03.317
The... Citizens' Integration
of Public Lands Act.

00:12:03.317 --> 00:12:06.898
Never heard of it. Gene, here, now.
Rita, why didn't you tell me about this?

00:12:06.898 --> 00:12:07.799
I just did.

00:12:07.799 --> 00:12:09.573
You need to tell me about it
before I need to know about it.

00:12:09.573 --> 00:12:11.215
- Marty, you are not the vice congressman.
- I am the legislative...

00:12:11.315 --> 00:12:15.116
Nobody voted for you. If Evan gets shot
in the head, you do not automatically...

00:12:15.216 --> 00:12:17.116
If Evan got shot in the head,
you're the first suspect.

00:12:17.116 --> 00:12:18.216
Play nice. Play nice.

00:12:18.316 --> 00:12:20.317
All right, Eugene,
Congressman Long's bill. What is it?

00:12:20.417 --> 00:12:23.417
HR7124, better known as CINPLAN.

00:12:23.517 --> 00:12:26.638
The bill would open up fringe areas
of the national parks for development.

00:12:26.638 --> 00:12:27.618
Long's been sitting on it
for ages...

00:12:27.718 --> 00:12:30.158
Got it. Pause.
Come on, Evan, this is huge.

00:12:30.193 --> 00:12:31.891
You hitch your wagon
to the right star,

00:12:31.891 --> 00:12:34.039
you could ride all the way down
to Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.446
This is day one.

00:12:35.481 --> 00:12:37.677
You got your name on
a major piece of legislation!

00:12:37.712 --> 00:12:40.464
Oh, and another thing,
he wants you to read it today.

00:12:40.727 --> 00:12:42.020
Well, I can't... do it today.

00:12:42.020 --> 00:12:43.220
I promised my kids...
- Eugene.

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:45.462
Well, sir, there's
a time clock on the bill.

00:12:45.462 --> 00:12:47.321
If Congressman Long wants to
pass it this quarter,

00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:50.026
he's gonna have to introduce it
to the committee immediately.

00:12:50.061 --> 00:12:52.593
I'm personally going with whatever
Congressman Baxter decides,

00:12:52.593 --> 00:12:55.010
because if I could be like one man,
it'd be him.

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.004
Either him or Kareem.

00:12:57.004 --> 00:12:58.146
Can I tase him?

00:12:58.146 --> 00:12:59.516
Gene! Heel!

00:12:59.551 --> 00:13:00.821
It'd probably be you.

00:13:00.856 --> 00:13:04.439
Come on, Evan, this is it!
This is why we came here!

00:13:04.474 --> 00:13:06.666
It's world-changing time!

00:13:09.501 --> 00:13:10.923
Hey, anybody home?

00:13:10.958 --> 00:13:12.257
Hey, dad, come on.
We're in here!

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.188
Hey, guys.

00:13:14.029 --> 00:13:17.638
Dad, guess what? I got all your stuff
packed up so that we can...

00:13:19.149 --> 00:13:20.282
What's wrong?

00:13:21.462 --> 00:13:22.989
We're not going,
are we?

00:13:23.024 --> 00:13:28.098
First things first. I have been asked
to junior cosponsor a bill.

00:13:28.537 --> 00:13:29.515
Yeah.

00:13:29.624 --> 00:13:32.335
See? I told you.
And you owe me five bucks.

00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:33.797
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Guys!

00:13:33.832 --> 00:13:36.695
Hey. Hey, we said we would
have to make sacrifices, right?

00:13:36.695 --> 00:13:39.062
Yeah. Whatever.
New house, same old dad.

00:13:39.062 --> 00:13:41.071
Hey, I'm the one
who has to read this thing!

00:13:41.106 --> 00:13:45.578
Hey. Did you hear?
Junior cosponsor of a bill.

00:13:47.222 --> 00:13:51.815
Okay, Ry, let's clean all this stuff up.
Dad's got work to do.

00:14:08.784 --> 00:14:10.634
No. It's 6:14.

00:14:10.734 --> 00:14:15.195
Of course.
Voodoo clock speaks again.

00:14:22.656 --> 00:14:23.649
What the...

00:14:24.561 --> 00:14:29.062
Hey! Hey! Hey! No. Okay.

00:14:29.062 --> 00:14:31.583
Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!
What's going on?

00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:34.564
I got a delivery
for... Evan Baxter!

00:14:34.599 --> 00:14:36.441
Yeah, that's not mine.
I didn't order that!

00:14:36.476 --> 00:14:40.105
I just deliver, guy, huh?
You got a complaint, call the number!

00:14:40.105 --> 00:14:44.223
No! Hey! Listen!
We are 416, not 614!

00:14:44.223 --> 00:14:48.490
You've got the wrong house!
You can't leave that there!

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:51.066
Listen! Listen!

00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:53.190
That's gonna leave a brown patch!

00:14:54.042 --> 00:14:56.346
I am a U.S. Congressman!

00:15:08.618 --> 00:15:10.369
Dad, what are you doing?
I'm watching this.

00:15:10.404 --> 00:15:12.141
Genesis 6:14.

00:15:15.780 --> 00:15:17.330
Gen 6:14.

00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:19.788
Joan!
Do we have a Bible anywhere?

00:15:28.393 --> 00:15:29.917
Genesis 6:14.

00:15:29.952 --> 00:15:32.529
"Make thee an ark
of gopher wood..."

00:15:33.224 --> 00:15:34.661
Gopher wood?

00:15:47.349 --> 00:15:49.559
"Go-4-wood." Get it?

00:15:53.457 --> 00:15:57.216
Well, it's... not really gopher wood.
I just like the wordplay.

00:15:57.251 --> 00:15:58.482
No, it's pine and maple.

00:15:58.517 --> 00:16:01.970
It was clear-cut from this valley
to make room for all those houses.

00:16:02.125 --> 00:16:03.863
Excuse me.
Do I know you?

00:16:03.898 --> 00:16:05.650
Not as well as I'd like.

00:16:07.261 --> 00:16:09.552
I see you got
my housewarming gift.

00:16:09.813 --> 00:16:12.307
That was you?
You sent those?

00:16:12.442 --> 00:16:14.859
What are they for? Hey! Hey.

00:16:15.113 --> 00:16:17.669
Genesis, chapter six,
verse fourteen.

00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:19.953
I want you to build an ark.

00:16:19.988 --> 00:16:22.282
You want me
to build an ark.

00:16:22.282 --> 00:16:23.368
Yes.

00:16:23.528 --> 00:16:28.741
So that's why the tools...
And you are responsible for the wood?

00:16:29.582 --> 00:16:32.043
All right.
Well, let's just start over.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.288
Hello, I am Evan Ba...

00:16:35.288 --> 00:16:38.482
Evan Baxter.
Born June 15, 1962.

00:16:38.482 --> 00:16:40.010
Eight pounds, 11 ounces.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:43.538
Mother's Carroll Ann Parker.
Father, Eugene Evan Baxter.

00:16:43.538 --> 00:16:47.614
Ooh-hoo-hoo. You have internet access.
Very impressive. Do you also have cable?

00:16:47.614 --> 00:16:51.087
You're a clean freak. You care much
too much about your outward appearance.

00:16:51.087 --> 00:16:53.602
Your left nipple is a quarter inch
higher than your right nipple.

00:16:53.602 --> 00:16:57.043
And when you were a little boy,
you were afraid of Gumby.

00:16:58.253 --> 00:16:59.598
Who are you?

00:17:00.593 --> 00:17:02.019
I'm God.

00:17:02.441 --> 00:17:03.774
You're God?

00:17:03.774 --> 00:17:09.200
Yes. And I want you, Evan Baxter,
to build an ark.

00:17:09.957 --> 00:17:15.032
Okay. You know what? This conversation
is a little thing I like to call... over!

00:17:15.067 --> 00:17:20.039
But I gotta get going, because,
frankly, I have an ark to build.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:24.327
Busy, busy, busy, busy. Nice meeting you.
Take care. Oh, and...

00:17:28.734 --> 00:17:31.080
All right,
see you later!

00:17:33.112 --> 00:17:36.684
Shake it off, Evan. It's over.
The nutcase is gone.

00:17:36.684 --> 00:17:39.911
I am successful, I'm powerful,
I'm handsome, I'm happy.

00:17:39.911 --> 00:17:41.802
Successful, powerful,
handsome, happy!

00:17:43.538 --> 00:17:45.861
Get it out, son.
It's the beginning of wisdom.

00:17:45.861 --> 00:17:48.050
How did you get in here?
I'm calling the cops.

00:17:48.085 --> 00:17:50.669
Oh, no. No need! Look! Look.
There's one right there. Right there.

00:17:51.014 --> 00:17:56.964
Officer! Officer! Officer! Carjacker!
Carjacker in the car! Carjacker in the car!

00:18:00.289 --> 00:18:03.864
Careful pulling out.
Pedestrian in the crosswalk.

00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:37.306
Shake it off, shake it off!
Shake it off, shake it off!

00:18:41.155 --> 00:18:42.349
Morning, chief!

00:18:43.462 --> 00:18:44.566
Good morning, Rita.

00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:47.402
You almost scared me to death!
What's wrong with you?

00:18:47.437 --> 00:18:49.419
Nothing.
Just sort of a weird ride in.

00:18:49.437 --> 00:18:50.078
Weird how?

00:18:50.178 --> 00:18:51.866
It was just
a weird ride in.

00:18:52.081 --> 00:18:54.235
Okay, well,
thanks for clarifying.

00:18:55.226 --> 00:18:57.561
Here's your mail and your schedule.
- Okay.

00:18:57.561 --> 00:19:01.099
Oh, and they finally fixed the phones.
My new extension is 6-14.

00:19:03.192 --> 00:19:04.247
6-14.

00:19:04.247 --> 00:19:05.381
Yeah. 6-1-4?

00:19:05.481 --> 00:19:06.812
Right.

00:19:07.558 --> 00:19:09.348
You want me
to write that down?

00:19:10.012 --> 00:19:12.122
I'd rather you didn't.

00:19:13.242 --> 00:19:14.161
Good morning.

00:19:14.266 --> 00:19:16.582
Hey, Long came through with that seat
on the House Resource Committee.

00:19:16.682 --> 00:19:19.183
You stuck in your thumb
and pulled out a plum, my friend.

00:19:19.454 --> 00:19:21.183
Also, the new Congressional plates
just came in.

00:19:21.283 --> 00:19:24.684
Gene, plates, now. And Alex
at the Buffalo office had her baby.

00:19:24.784 --> 00:19:26.584
- Boy or girl?
- A little boy. And here he is.

00:19:26.584 --> 00:19:29.785
Just as cute as a button. Not bad
for such an ugly woman. Weighed in at...

00:19:29.885 --> 00:19:31.585
Six pounds, 14 ounces.

00:19:32.385 --> 00:19:33.585
How'd you know that?

00:19:33.757 --> 00:19:34.685
Lucky guess.

00:19:35.886 --> 00:19:40.897
Hot, hot, hot! Hot off the press!
It's a joke. Here are your plates, sir.

00:19:41.986 --> 00:19:44.187
Those are rock-star plates, man.
You can park anywhere.

00:19:44.187 --> 00:19:45.287
You can't be
sitting in a chair.

00:19:45.387 --> 00:19:46.887
You got a committee meeting
in five minutes.

00:19:46.887 --> 00:19:52.329
Come on, BMIC, Big Man in Congress.
Evan Baxter, the shark on the move.

00:19:59.513 --> 00:20:01.537
House Resources Committee
is now in order.

00:20:01.537 --> 00:20:03.590
The Chair recognizes the congresswoman
from Tennessee

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.654
to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:09.026
I pledge allegiance
to the flag...

00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:11.591
of the United States of America

00:20:11.691 --> 00:20:15.292
and to the Republic,
for which it stands...

00:20:15.292 --> 00:20:17.292
- ...one nation, under me...
- One nation, under God...

00:20:17.292 --> 00:20:21.493
Indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

00:20:23.241 --> 00:20:26.606
How long do you want to do this, son?
I've got all eternity.

00:20:37.206 --> 00:20:39.952
Hey. You okay,
young man?

00:20:41.538 --> 00:20:42.978
- What happened?
- You fainted.

00:20:42.978 --> 00:20:44.942
Dropped like a leaf
during the Pledge of Allegiance.

00:20:44.942 --> 00:20:47.428
Chuck Long,
Resources Committee Chairman.

00:20:47.428 --> 00:20:50.797
Oh. Oh. Congressman Long. Yes.
Oh, I'm so... I'm so sorry...

00:20:50.897 --> 00:20:55.087
Forget it! Many a man's been humbled
by his first day in Congress.

00:20:55.235 --> 00:20:56.884
So, how'd you like that office?

00:20:56.919 --> 00:20:58.893
Oh, it was great.
Yes. Thank you, sir.

00:20:58.893 --> 00:21:01.115
Not bad for
a freshman dorm room, huh?

00:21:01.499 --> 00:21:03.100
So, here's the skinny.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.155
I'm bringing you
into my land use bill

00:21:05.155 --> 00:21:08.421
because you strike me as the type of guy
who knows how to hit the ground running.

00:21:08.456 --> 00:21:12.018
Yes, sir. I read the bill, and it's great.
I just had a few questions.

00:21:12.053 --> 00:21:14.302
Hey, I wrote the thing
and I have a few questions.

00:21:14.337 --> 00:21:17.529
We'll get to the questions later.
So, you with us?

00:21:17.529 --> 00:21:19.245
- Yes, sir. I'm in.
- Wonderful!

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:21.123
I'll need you to put that
into a letter of intent,

00:21:21.123 --> 00:21:23.578
as soon as you're feeling up to it,
of course. You get yourself better.

00:21:23.578 --> 00:21:25.186
Enjoy that office.

00:21:25.186 --> 00:21:26.561
Thank you, sir.

00:21:26.596 --> 00:21:30.964
He's exhausted from reading that bill.
I got woozy from just carrying it.

00:21:31.189 --> 00:21:32.607
Evan, sit down.

00:21:32.642 --> 00:21:33.721
Evan, what happened to you?

00:21:33.721 --> 00:21:36.151
You can't faint during the Pledge
of Allegiance. It's un-American.

00:21:36.186 --> 00:21:37.105
Oh, good. The doctor's here.

00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:38.205
Say "ah".

00:21:40.021 --> 00:21:44.193
Just go home, get some rest
and start on that ark. You hear me?

00:21:50.279 --> 00:21:51.426
Evan?

00:21:52.147 --> 00:21:55.127
Okay. God warned Noah
that a great flood was coming.

00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:58.637
Noah build the ark
for his wife and 3 sons...

00:22:03.609 --> 00:22:07.452
The ark was 300 qubics long and
50 qubics high.

00:22:07.723 --> 00:22:09.199
That's... insane.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:12.495
- What's insane?
- Hm?

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:13.410
Congressman Long's bill?

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:15.988
Yea... The bill. That's what
I was looking at... Oh, man,

00:22:15.988 --> 00:22:19.204
there's a lot of, uh...
a lot of research to do on it

00:22:20.455 --> 00:22:23.212
You know, baby, you have
every right to be freaked out.

00:22:23.994 --> 00:22:25.885
I'm not freaked out,
why would I be freaked out?

00:22:25.885 --> 00:22:30.239
I'm freaking out, this house alone is
as huge as Jasmine and you got a new job and...

00:22:30.496 --> 00:22:35.261
new land act bill you're working on,
we're in a new town... I mean, that's alot of new.

00:22:35.526 --> 00:22:36.790
So you thinking
I'm just stressed?

00:22:36.814 --> 00:22:41.161
Evan, honey, I've known you 20 years.
I know your stressed.

00:22:46.316 --> 00:22:48.716
- Well, that's the sugar kicking in.
- Yes, it is.

00:22:49.216 --> 00:22:51.843
Thank you honey
- Enjoy your ice cream.

00:22:51.843 --> 00:22:52.832
I will, thanks.

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:56.688
She's right. This is crazy.

00:22:56.894 --> 00:22:58.953
I'm just stressed
and you are gone.

00:23:03.691 --> 00:23:05.917
Gooood morning, troops!

00:23:05.917 --> 00:23:08.789
- Good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?

00:23:10.525 --> 00:23:11.878
Somebody is in a good mood.

00:23:11.878 --> 00:23:16.006
I am. I thought about what you said and
you are right, I need to get my head on straight.

00:23:16.006 --> 00:23:19.318
Guess what? This weekend
we're going on a hiking trip.

00:23:19.721 --> 00:23:23.319
Yeeaa. Right here. High five me.
Righteous. Righteous.

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:25.150
We're gonna have
a righteous hiking trip.

00:23:25.222 --> 00:23:27.970
Hey, dad, look! Two doves.
That's supposed to be good luck.

00:23:27.970 --> 00:23:30.561
Hmm... Well,
today must be my lucky day.

00:23:30.596 --> 00:23:32.925
Bye, guys.
- Bye-bye

00:23:36.816 --> 00:23:39.498
Good morning, kitties.
Keep moving... find your house.

00:23:54.458 --> 00:23:57.374
Hey! When you're
on my lawn, keep it in your pot!

00:24:02.843 --> 00:24:07.318
Ohh... ohh... hey!
Thank's for sharing.

00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.475
Oh, you're right on time.

00:25:25.505 --> 00:25:29.066
Long just called. He's on his way with the
powers-to-be. Who are they, Gene? Talk.

00:25:29.066 --> 00:25:30.742
Congressman Jim Dodd,
head of Ways and Means.

00:25:30.742 --> 00:25:33.042
But don't worry, sir,
he's definitely not "way mean".

00:25:33.142 --> 00:25:35.233
That's speculation.
I don't know him personally...

00:25:35.233 --> 00:25:36.042
That's too much, Gene.
Who else?

00:25:36.142 --> 00:25:38.043
Congressman Richard Stamp,
head of Commerce,

00:25:38.143 --> 00:25:39.643
and Bob Hughes
is Transportation.

00:25:39.643 --> 00:25:40.943
I have a draft
of your support letter.

00:25:41.043 --> 00:25:42.943
- Sounds like a plan.
- Are you all right?

00:25:43.117 --> 00:25:43.777
I'm good.

00:25:43.777 --> 00:25:45.921
You sure you're good?
Okay.

00:25:47.944 --> 00:25:49.336
- Good morning, chief.
- Good morning, Rita.

00:25:49.336 --> 00:25:50.726
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

00:25:50.761 --> 00:25:52.518
- You don't look so good.
- That's what I said.

00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:54.413
You're all jumpy.
Are you on that Fen-Phen?

00:25:54.413 --> 00:25:56.346
Guys, I'm fine.
I'll be inside.

00:26:08.636 --> 00:26:11.236
Oh. No, no, no, no. No.

00:26:11.935 --> 00:26:16.449
No. Okay. No, no.
No. No, no. No.

00:26:17.749 --> 00:26:20.642
No, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my gosh!

00:26:21.262 --> 00:26:26.017
Guys! No, no! Get out!
Get out! Oh, my hair!

00:26:26.250 --> 00:26:28.451
Gentlemen, welcome.
What an honor to have you here.

00:26:28.451 --> 00:26:30.851
I'm Marty Stringer.
I'm Congressman Baxter's chief of staff.

00:26:30.951 --> 00:26:33.051
This is Rita Daniels,
his executive assistant.

00:26:33.527 --> 00:26:35.052
<i>Are you ready, sir?</i>

00:26:35.284 --> 00:26:39.560
Just a minute. No, no, no, no.
Dirty, dirty, dirty, diry, dirty! Big one!

00:26:39.719 --> 00:26:42.753
Baxter's only a freshman, sir, but I think
you'll find he is locked and loaded.

00:26:42.853 --> 00:26:45.853
Good. Maybe this young stud can help me
get these old mares on board.

00:26:45.953 --> 00:26:47.054
Oh, you will be impressed.

00:26:51.391 --> 00:26:54.043
Gentlemen.
Good to see you.

00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:59.838
Do you want to explain yourself,
Congressman? What is going on?

00:27:00.004 --> 00:27:02.083
Oh. These...

00:27:03.654 --> 00:27:05.239
are birds.

00:27:05.384 --> 00:27:08.169
What are they doing here?
How did they get in here?

00:27:08.169 --> 00:27:10.920
Well, that is
an excellent question.

00:27:10.944 --> 00:27:14.245
And... my response
to said question is...

00:27:14.348 --> 00:27:16.131
they are trained...

00:27:16.991 --> 00:27:19.615
aviaries, sir.

00:27:20.159 --> 00:27:23.899
Let me make you... see
what I'm talking about.

00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:30.672
I can make any sort of movement,
and they will not get off!

00:27:30.672 --> 00:27:32.866
Do you have a point,
Congressman?

00:27:32.901 --> 00:27:34.461
Hey, guys,
what's the point?

00:27:36.961 --> 00:27:37.968
What's my point.

00:27:39.562 --> 00:27:40.882
I'll tell you.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.163
The point... is...

00:27:45.563 --> 00:27:47.769
that man...

00:27:48.628 --> 00:27:52.052
needs to dominate... creatures

00:27:52.949 --> 00:27:55.989
and, ultimately, man must...

00:27:56.763 --> 00:28:00.568
dictate what happens
in this country.

00:28:04.066 --> 00:28:05.823
God bless America.

00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.959
I couldn't agree more.

00:28:09.959 --> 00:28:11.681
You have got
to be kidding me.

00:28:11.716 --> 00:28:12.909
No, of course not.

00:28:12.944 --> 00:28:16.702
We lost a huge project last year
because of the red-headed woodpecker.

00:28:16.737 --> 00:28:18.368
Those environmentalists
got so up in arms

00:28:18.468 --> 00:28:21.368
over the potential disappearance
of one stupid bird...

00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:23.187
Yeah, birds are stupid
sometimes.

00:28:23.187 --> 00:28:25.832
...we lost over 25 million dollars
in business.

00:28:25.832 --> 00:28:28.770
I see where you're going with this,
Congressman. Good work!

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:32.798
Your little display has obviously
hit a chord. Gentlemen.

00:28:36.271 --> 00:28:41.672
From now on, let's keep the surprises
to a maximum of, say... none. Understood?

00:28:41.772 --> 00:28:43.849
Yes, sir.
Absolutely, sir.

00:28:53.574 --> 00:28:56.983
Evan, that was brilliant.
Risky, but brilliant.

00:28:59.525 --> 00:29:00.475
What the he...?

00:29:00.575 --> 00:29:05.575
I'll tell you one thing, these birds had
a nice big meal before they flew in here.

00:29:05.675 --> 00:29:07.076
You want me
to get my BB gun?

00:29:07.176 --> 00:29:09.376
You know what I want you to do?
I want you to open the door.

00:29:09.376 --> 00:29:10.476
Open the door?

00:29:10.476 --> 00:29:11.676
Just open the door!

00:29:11.676 --> 00:29:13.977
Close the door after I leave!
Just do it!

00:29:14.077 --> 00:29:15.077
Okay.

00:29:15.177 --> 00:29:18.077
One, two, three!

00:29:24.071 --> 00:29:27.889
Man, if I get the bird flu,
he is paying for my medical bills!

00:29:38.006 --> 00:29:40.079
Sheeeeep!

00:29:48.638 --> 00:29:50.672
Oh... no.

00:29:56.383 --> 00:29:58.636
Oh, gosh.

00:30:00.603 --> 00:30:02.284
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get out!

00:30:28.188 --> 00:30:29.589
Okay. No.

00:30:31.089 --> 00:30:34.389
No. No.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.990
I'm not doing this.
It's insane!

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:41.191
No!

00:30:42.091 --> 00:30:43.891
Enough already!

00:30:44.015 --> 00:30:46.676
See, if you had an ark,
you'd have a place to put them all.

00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:48.292
Why are you doing this?
Why me?

00:30:50.492 --> 00:30:53.893
It's not time yet.
Go on. Go on.

00:30:54.493 --> 00:30:55.793
Yeah, go on.

00:30:55.893 --> 00:30:59.093
So how about it?
Feel like living on the edge?

00:31:08.895 --> 00:31:12.495
Beautiful, isn't it?
I remember creating this valley.

00:31:13.396 --> 00:31:15.896
Notice how the mountains
line up east to west.

00:31:15.996 --> 00:31:18.396
That's so there'd be
lots of sunshine.

00:31:18.396 --> 00:31:19.897
Where are we?

00:31:21.397 --> 00:31:23.097
Don't recognize it, eh?

00:31:23.297 --> 00:31:24.297
No.

00:31:24.697 --> 00:31:28.598
This is where you live, son.
This is Prestige Crest.

00:31:30.098 --> 00:31:32.399
I wanted you to see
the original design.

00:31:47.016 --> 00:31:50.601
So, you're... really Him,
aren't you?

00:31:50.702 --> 00:31:54.102
You want more proof? I haven't done
the pillar of salt thing in a while.

00:31:54.202 --> 00:31:57.803
That's all right. I believe you. I just...
I don't understand why you chose me.

00:31:57.903 --> 00:31:59.703
You want
to change the world, son.

00:32:00.903 --> 00:32:02.303
So do I.

00:32:05.704 --> 00:32:09.304
What? Why an ark?
I mean, that's like flood territory.

00:32:09.404 --> 00:32:13.705
You wouldn't do that again.
You wouldn't do that. Would you do that?

00:32:13.805 --> 00:32:16.506
Let's just say that
whatever I do,

00:32:17.306 --> 00:32:19.206
I do because I love you.

00:32:19.906 --> 00:32:24.407
Well, then you have to understand
that this whole building-an-ark thing

00:32:24.507 --> 00:32:25.907
is really not part
of my plans here.

00:32:26.007 --> 00:32:28.908
I need to settle into my house.
I need to make a good impression at work.

00:32:30.508 --> 00:32:31.708
What?

00:32:32.108 --> 00:32:33.308
Your plans. That's just...

00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:37.809
What are you talking...

00:32:37.909 --> 00:32:40.409
We're talking about an ark, right?
I mean, an ark?

00:32:40.409 --> 00:32:43.910
An ark is huge! I don't
even know where I would begin!

00:32:44.310 --> 00:32:45.810
Well, I hear that a lot.

00:32:45.910 --> 00:32:49.511
People want to change the world,
don't know how to begin.

00:32:53.011 --> 00:32:54.812
You wanna know
how to change the world, son?

00:32:56.112 --> 00:32:58.712
One act of random kindness
at a time.

00:33:07.514 --> 00:33:08.814
Build the ark.

00:33:08.914 --> 00:33:11.914
I'll tell you what.
You build it, I'll fill it.

00:33:12.514 --> 00:33:17.415
And if anybody asks,
tell them... a flood's coming.

00:33:19.115 --> 00:33:22.016
Oh, and, uh,
you might need this.

00:33:25.817 --> 00:33:29.817
Well, okay. Okay, so what do I do?
I grab the wood and...

00:33:29.917 --> 00:33:31.417
Well, okay.

00:33:31.517 --> 00:33:34.818
You know,
that's... just... cruel.

00:33:36.418 --> 00:33:37.918
Do you see him?

00:33:39.119 --> 00:33:40.519
I don't see him.

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:45.020
"Building an Ark
the Old-Fashioned Way."

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.620
"God is the creator of
the Heavens and the Earth.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.621
"He lives in all things and has over
six billion seven hundred million children."

00:34:17.625 --> 00:34:20.325
Honey? You okay?
You need something?

00:34:22.325 --> 00:34:25.626
No, nothing.
Just... dropped something.

00:35:01.832 --> 00:35:03.332
Okay. Okay.

00:35:10.333 --> 00:35:11.733
Yeah.

00:35:11.833 --> 00:35:14.834
There we go. Okay.

00:35:21.835 --> 00:35:25.335
Come on. I mean, a beard?
A beard's so dirty.

00:35:27.236 --> 00:35:28.236
Gross!

00:35:28.336 --> 00:35:30.536
Packing, so it would really help me
out if you would...

00:35:30.536 --> 00:35:31.636
Good morning.

00:35:34.137 --> 00:35:35.237
Wow.

00:35:35.637 --> 00:35:37.837
What's with the scruffle,
mountain man?

00:35:37.937 --> 00:35:43.238
Oh, well, you know, I figured... it was
a weekend, and... I thought...

00:35:43.338 --> 00:35:44.438
What?

00:35:46.939 --> 00:35:50.239
Honey, did I miss something?
How long have you been growing that?

00:35:51.439 --> 00:35:52.540
I'll get the door!

00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:55.240
Congratulations!

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:56.640
What are you talking about?

00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:59.541
The lots. You bought
the lots next door!

00:35:59.641 --> 00:36:01.541
Hello!

00:36:02.541 --> 00:36:03.541
Oh...

00:36:07.442 --> 00:36:12.043
And pulling the down payment out of
your home equity? Very gutsy move.

00:36:12.143 --> 00:36:14.343
I didn't do that,
did I?

00:36:14.543 --> 00:36:16.944
You sure did. So what's your plan?
What are you gonna do?

00:36:16.944 --> 00:36:19.144
Turn them for a quick profit?
Build them out on spec?

00:36:21.044 --> 00:36:24.745
Who wants champagne?
Hip, hip hooray!

00:36:27.945 --> 00:36:29.345
You bought eight lots?

00:36:29.445 --> 00:36:31.846
Yup. I was, uh,
going to surprise you.

00:36:33.146 --> 00:36:36.547
"Surprise, surprise, surprise."
Gomer Pyle.

00:36:38.547 --> 00:36:41.147
What are you doing?
We can't afford that.

00:36:41.147 --> 00:36:43.548
Hey, mom. John Lennon,
good to see you again.

00:36:43.648 --> 00:36:45.248
Good to see you.

00:36:46.548 --> 00:36:50.149
And eight lots? What are you gonna
do with eight lots?

00:36:50.949 --> 00:36:53.849
I don't know.
Maybe I'll build a boat.

00:36:53.949 --> 00:36:55.750
Did you say
"build a boat"?

00:36:55.850 --> 00:36:57.650
It might be something fun
for the family.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:37:00.950
We could, uh, take the boat,
go sailing on the lake.

00:37:01.951 --> 00:37:03.951
It'd be great in case
it floods or something.

00:37:04.229 --> 00:37:06.051
What is going on with you?

00:37:06.551 --> 00:37:10.252
You bought all those lots
and you're talking about building a boat.

00:37:10.352 --> 00:37:12.252
- Yeah.
- And you grow this crazy beard!

00:37:12.252 --> 00:37:13.853
Is this, like, a midlife crisis?

00:37:13.953 --> 00:37:15.253
It's not that bad!

00:37:15.353 --> 00:37:16.353
- It's not?
- No.

00:37:16.453 --> 00:37:18.253
Why do you think
they call it a crisis?

00:37:19.653 --> 00:37:21.554
Hey, keep it down,
you guys! Okay?

00:37:23.354 --> 00:37:24.754
Oh, my God.

00:37:24.854 --> 00:37:26.154
Honey?

00:37:26.254 --> 00:37:27.555
Oh, my God.

00:37:28.955 --> 00:37:29.955
Honey?

00:37:32.055 --> 00:37:34.056
I know this sounds crazy.

00:37:35.156 --> 00:37:37.556
I really think
I need to do this.

00:37:41.157 --> 00:37:42.357
Okay.

00:37:43.157 --> 00:37:44.757
Build your boat.

00:37:45.858 --> 00:37:48.258
Just don't take
too long, okay?

00:37:48.358 --> 00:37:53.559
Because we didn't leave our lives in Buffalo
so you could... sail the S.S. Depression.

00:38:13.062 --> 00:38:14.262
Here we go.

00:38:14.462 --> 00:38:17.963
Gentlemen, I'm sure you're all wondering
why I've assembled you here today.

00:38:18.063 --> 00:38:20.863
An Argentine lake duck has
a penis as long as its body.

00:38:20.863 --> 00:38:22.863
Wow, that's huge.
He must be proud.

00:38:22.963 --> 00:38:27.164
So, I have come up with a little
construction project for us this weekend.

00:38:27.545 --> 00:38:28.364
The whole weekend?

00:38:28.464 --> 00:38:29.865
The whole weekend. Yes!

00:38:30.065 --> 00:38:31.765
Maybe a couple weekends
after that.

00:38:31.865 --> 00:38:34.065
I can do this. Help!

00:38:35.365 --> 00:38:38.266
How do I stand up with
a piece of wood? Here we go.

00:38:39.766 --> 00:38:41.466
Oh, man.
Okay, that's good.

00:38:43.067 --> 00:38:46.767
Mooooother!
Father! Sister! Brother! Wow!

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:48.467
Keep it straight.

00:38:51.868 --> 00:38:53.568
Hey, dad... He's back!

00:38:53.868 --> 00:38:55.369
Ryan, no, don't do...

00:38:55.469 --> 00:38:56.469
Ow!

00:38:57.369 --> 00:39:00.369
Leverage it up!
Leverage. Okay.

00:39:00.369 --> 00:39:01.970
Just put some leverage.
You gotta put some body weight.

00:39:02.070 --> 00:39:04.070
Ready? One, two, three.
Come on.

00:39:08.171 --> 00:39:09.771
Oh, I'm an idiot.

00:39:09.771 --> 00:39:13.271
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Congressman.
Why do you have raw beef hands?"

00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:15.372
"Well, I'm building an ark."

00:39:17.872 --> 00:39:21.173
I got a boo-boo! I got a boo-boo!
I got a boo-boo!

00:39:26.974 --> 00:39:31.874
You ever hear of Home Depot?
Here we go! Here we go! Oh, yeah!

00:39:42.076 --> 00:39:46.077
All right. So our little Marlboro Man
moment didn't work out so well.

00:39:46.177 --> 00:39:49.077
It's a disaster. I don't know
how to build something like this.

00:39:49.077 --> 00:39:50.777
That's easy. Just don't.

00:39:55.178 --> 00:39:56.178
Wow.

00:39:57.848 --> 00:39:58.915
Hello.

00:39:59.179 --> 00:40:02.279
Yes, Marty. Your fearless leader
is right here.

00:40:03.479 --> 00:40:04.579
Hey, Marty, what's up?

00:40:14.081 --> 00:40:16.681
Yes, I'll tell him.
Thank you.

00:40:19.882 --> 00:40:22.282
I might need security.
Thank you.

00:40:24.883 --> 00:40:26.183
Can I help you?

00:40:26.483 --> 00:40:27.583
Rita, it's me.

00:40:27.983 --> 00:40:31.584
Why do you sound like Evan Baxter,
but look like a Bee Gee?

00:40:31.584 --> 00:40:33.084
Okay. All right.

00:40:33.584 --> 00:40:36.484
Okay, that's great.
It's longer.

00:40:36.484 --> 00:40:39.385
Oh, my God. It is you.

00:40:39.985 --> 00:40:42.085
Evan, what happened?

00:40:42.185 --> 00:40:43.286
Did you fall
in a mine shaft?

00:40:43.386 --> 00:40:44.386
No.

00:40:44.486 --> 00:40:45.486
Did you just
come out of a coma?

00:40:45.586 --> 00:40:46.586
No.

00:40:46.686 --> 00:40:48.886
Were you attacked
by a werewolf?

00:40:48.886 --> 00:40:50.187
No, I wasn't.

00:40:50.287 --> 00:40:53.187
Well, if you were going for
that rugged look, you overshot it.

00:40:53.187 --> 00:40:54.787
You look like
a bum in a suit.

00:40:54.887 --> 00:40:56.988
You need Super cuts
and a shave.

00:40:58.488 --> 00:41:00.588
Right! Yeah.
But I can't. It doesn't work.

00:41:00.688 --> 00:41:02.289
What do you mean,
it doesn't work?

00:41:02.389 --> 00:41:03.689
It doesn't work!

00:41:03.789 --> 00:41:05.489
What? Are you shooting up Rogaine?

00:41:05.489 --> 00:41:08.990
Rita, if Evan shows up... I'm sorry, sir.
I'll be with you in just one mo...

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:11.790
Evan?
- Take it in. Take it in.

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:13.590
Okay, yeah, to answer any questions
you may have,

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:15.791
I am going through
adult puberty!

00:41:15.891 --> 00:41:18.291
This is all temporary.
Why did you bring me down here?

00:41:18.391 --> 00:41:19.491
What was so important?

00:41:19.591 --> 00:41:21.292
What is so important?

00:41:21.392 --> 00:41:24.092
I got a letter of intent here
about Congressman Long's bill.

00:41:24.092 --> 00:41:25.192
You remember that,
don't you?

00:41:25.292 --> 00:41:28.393
Well, you haven't been here and now
he wants you to sign this in person, Evan!

00:41:28.393 --> 00:41:30.693
No, I can't do that. Nope, nope, nope.
Not gonna happen.

00:41:30.793 --> 00:41:33.594
No. You can't do that.
Not looking like that. You have to go shave!

00:41:33.694 --> 00:41:35.994
I can't shave, Marty.
When I shave, it grows back out.

00:41:36.094 --> 00:41:38.994
That happens when you shave!
But then you shave again!

00:41:39.094 --> 00:41:40.595
You have no idea.

00:41:40.595 --> 00:41:43.595
Evan, what is going on?

00:41:43.695 --> 00:41:44.895
I'm...

00:41:49.396 --> 00:41:51.196
building something.

00:41:52.697 --> 00:41:54.397
You're building something?

00:41:54.497 --> 00:41:56.197
Well, I hope
it's a barber shop.

00:41:56.297 --> 00:41:59.198
Guys, I can't let Long see me
this way, okay?

00:41:59.198 --> 00:42:02.398
You're gonna have to tell him I'm sick.
Just cover for me. Just help me out!

00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:08.599
Come on, Evan, be reasonable.
You gotta get rid of that beard.

00:42:08.699 --> 00:42:10.599
I need your face back.
I need you back.

00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:12.300
Can you at least tell me
what you're building?

00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.500
- I'm building a boat.
- You're building a boat?

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.200
Look, you gotta cover for me.
I don't want anybody to see...

00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:19.501
Congressman!
There you are!

00:42:19.601 --> 00:42:21.601
Congressman Long, I, I, I, I...

00:42:21.601 --> 00:42:24.602
Stop stammering, son.
We all play hooky from time to time.

00:42:24.702 --> 00:42:28.502
I'm not gonna turn you in to the principal.
Mostly because I am the principal.

00:42:29.902 --> 00:42:31.003
Very good.

00:42:31.003 --> 00:42:33.503
What's with the veil?
Did you get your new set of braces?

00:42:33.503 --> 00:42:37.004
No.  No, no. I...
That's, uh, hilarious, though.

00:42:37.104 --> 00:42:39.904
Would you drop that thing, son?
I can't understand a word you're saying.

00:42:49.205 --> 00:42:51.106
It's a wife thing, sir.

00:42:51.206 --> 00:42:52.906
Just trying
to spice up the love life.

00:42:53.906 --> 00:42:56.307
She's a big
Loggins and Messina fan.

00:42:56.307 --> 00:42:58.707
Keeping it fresh.
Keeping it real.

00:42:58.707 --> 00:43:01.407
Would you excuse us
for a moment?

00:43:01.507 --> 00:43:03.908
The Congressman and I are going to
have a little chat.

00:43:07.908 --> 00:43:09.009
Come on.

00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:11.309
Nice, isn't it?
Politics is dog-eat-dog,

00:43:11.409 --> 00:43:14.009
but if you survive, they give you
a bigger den. Have a seat.

00:43:14.109 --> 00:43:18.110
So, tell me, Congressman,
are you freaking out on me or what?

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:19.210
No, sir.

00:43:19.210 --> 00:43:22.511
Oh, come on, son. I hand you
your first cosponsor ship of a bill,

00:43:22.611 --> 00:43:24.911
and when you finally show up
you look like the fifth Beatle.

00:43:25.011 --> 00:43:27.311
Now, you expect me to believe
everything is hunky dory?

00:43:27.411 --> 00:43:30.212
Well, sir, actually, things have been
a little more dory.

00:43:30.312 --> 00:43:34.413
Of course they are. I get it.
You know anything about animals, son?

00:43:35.613 --> 00:43:38.613
The Argentine lake duck has a penis
as long as its body.

00:43:40.714 --> 00:43:44.614
Although you probably already know that.
Or have heard it. Not experienced it.

00:43:44.614 --> 00:43:46.815
You ever heard
of the Arctic white wolf?

00:43:46.815 --> 00:43:47.915
No, sir.

00:43:47.915 --> 00:43:49.015
Top of the food chain.

00:43:49.115 --> 00:43:51.815
It's fast, it's smart, can fend for itself,
but it chooses not to.

00:43:51.915 --> 00:43:53.416
It chooses
to run with a pack.

00:43:53.516 --> 00:43:54.616
And do you know why?

00:43:54.616 --> 00:43:55.616
No.

00:43:55.716 --> 00:43:58.216
The Arctic white wolf,
Congressman, realizes

00:43:58.316 --> 00:44:00.017
that it is stronger
as part of a group.

00:44:00.117 --> 00:44:03.117
Do you know what happens when one of
these wolves decides to fend for itself?

00:44:03.117 --> 00:44:05.918
The pack kills the loner
for the greater good of the community.

00:44:06.018 --> 00:44:07.718
Ouch, that hurts.

00:44:07.718 --> 00:44:11.018
Are you familiar with Jim Jenkins,
the junior congressman from Tennessee?

00:44:11.118 --> 00:44:14.519
When I met Congressman Jenkins,
he was fresh off the turnip truck,

00:44:14.619 --> 00:44:16.719
but now he's sitting
on his own committee.

00:44:16.819 --> 00:44:19.920
Congressman Jenkins, Congressman
Whitehall, Congressman Freeman,

00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:23.720
they all have committee chairs
because they all run with the pack.

00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:25.921
Now, you have
to come to a decision.

00:44:26.021 --> 00:44:28.221
Are you gonna run with the pack
or are you gonna lone wolf it?

00:44:28.321 --> 00:44:30.421
I... am a pack man, sir.

00:44:30.521 --> 00:44:34.622
Good. I'm introducing the CINPLAN bill
in 2 weeks. C-SPAN is covering it live.

00:44:34.722 --> 00:44:36.822
I want your full support
and nothing else.

00:44:36.922 --> 00:44:38.023
Yes, sir.

00:44:39.023 --> 00:44:41.223
Those fish are on you
like bait on a hook.

00:44:43.223 --> 00:44:44.824
Birds follow you.

00:44:45.724 --> 00:44:47.424
Fish follow you.

00:44:51.125 --> 00:44:54.325
Let's see if we can get
some congressmen to follow you.

00:44:54.325 --> 00:44:56.426
Let's get this bill passed,
shall we, Congressman?

00:44:56.526 --> 00:44:57.626
Yes, sir.

00:44:59.826 --> 00:45:01.426
Hey, fleabag,
out of the way.

00:45:01.526 --> 00:45:03.527
Hey, dad, I think there are more
animals than yesterday.

00:45:03.527 --> 00:45:05.727
Well, let's not keep
our audience waiting, shall we?

00:45:08.827 --> 00:45:13.128
Up, up. Push it up. Push it.
We got it. We got it. Oh, yeah, yeah.

00:45:13.928 --> 00:45:16.629
Come on.
Just let it go, just let it go.

00:45:20.129 --> 00:45:22.530
Dad, we can do this,
but we're gonna need some help.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:25.830
I know. We just need something
to lift those beams.

00:45:28.131 --> 00:45:29.631
Like that?

00:45:29.731 --> 00:45:31.331
Holy moly!

00:45:32.531 --> 00:45:35.032
This is so totally awesome!

00:45:35.032 --> 00:45:36.632
This is perfect.

00:45:36.632 --> 00:45:38.132
Dad, there's a note.

00:45:44.433 --> 00:45:46.033
Let me see that.

00:45:48.634 --> 00:45:50.234
How does it work?

00:45:57.835 --> 00:45:59.736
Dad, this is really weird.

00:45:59.736 --> 00:46:02.036
Repeat after me.
"We are hamsters!"

00:46:02.136 --> 00:46:03.736
We are hamsters!

00:46:03.836 --> 00:46:05.436
Leg power!

00:46:05.536 --> 00:46:07.037
Leg power!

00:46:07.837 --> 00:46:08.837
And it's in!

00:46:09.937 --> 00:46:11.037
That's it.

00:46:13.238 --> 00:46:16.238
Hey, who has opposable thumbs?
Anybody?

00:46:20.939 --> 00:46:24.039
You wanna try this one?
Make sure it's straight.

00:46:24.139 --> 00:46:25.740
- This is awesome!
- This is so cool.

00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.740
- Here we go.
- Oh, my God!

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:31.441
Yeah. Gotta do the dance.
Come on, let's do the dance.

00:46:32.741 --> 00:46:34.641
We're doing the dance.
- Dylan, come on. Do the dance.

00:46:34.641 --> 00:46:36.441
- Come on, do the dance.
- I'm not doing the dance.

00:46:39.042 --> 00:46:40.042
Ow!

00:46:41.542 --> 00:46:42.642
Don't scratch!

00:46:42.742 --> 00:46:43.742
Stop it. Come here.

00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:47.343
Insult to injury! My!

00:46:47.443 --> 00:46:48.443
Good boy.

00:46:48.543 --> 00:46:49.543
Okay, guys. A little bit more.

00:46:49.643 --> 00:46:52.544
Here we go. I got it.
Keep it... That's it!

00:46:53.644 --> 00:46:54.844
Beautiful!

00:46:59.945 --> 00:47:01.045
You guys all right?

00:47:01.145 --> 00:47:02.345
Yup.

00:47:19.948 --> 00:47:20.948
"G."

00:47:35.251 --> 00:47:37.751
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

00:47:40.251 --> 00:47:43.252
Well, I hope
this isn't our last supper.

00:47:45.952 --> 00:47:48.153
<i>... so this dry,
hot weather will continue.</i>

00:47:48.153 --> 00:47:51.153
<i>Until September 22, midday.</i>

00:47:51.253 --> 00:47:54.354
<i>If the ark isn't finished
by then, you will be.</i>

00:47:54.754 --> 00:47:58.054
Is that when it's going to happen?
September 22, midday?

00:47:58.154 --> 00:48:00.455
<i>High temperatures tomorrow
back into the 90s everywhere,</i>

00:48:00.555 --> 00:48:01.755
<i>right on through Tuesday</i>

00:48:01.755 --> 00:48:05.255
<i>and the next seven days,
no showers, no storms.</i>

00:48:05.355 --> 00:48:09.556
That would be a good day to have chicken.
How about mom's chicken? Huh?

00:48:09.656 --> 00:48:12.056
Hon, could we have some more chicken
September 22, midday?

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:17.357
Boys, will you excuse us, please?
Your father and I need to have a little talk.

00:48:17.457 --> 00:48:18.957
Busted.

00:48:19.058 --> 00:48:20.258
Dad, you're busted.

00:48:20.258 --> 00:48:21.458
Yeah, I know.

00:48:23.358 --> 00:48:24.758
What are you doing?

00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:26.059
Do we have anything
unleavened?

00:48:26.159 --> 00:48:29.659
Yeah, we do, it's in the back,
next to the frankincense and myrrh.

00:48:29.759 --> 00:48:32.960
We have a fancy name for it
in this century, it's called pita.

00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:34.860
Got it.

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:36.860
Evan, what is
happening to you?

00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:41.261
Don't! No!
Just put it down! Look at you.

00:48:41.261 --> 00:48:46.662
The hair. Are you on something?
Is it a mega-growth hormone? What?

00:48:48.262 --> 00:48:49.962
Evan, talk to me.

00:48:58.364 --> 00:49:00.164
I'm building an ark.

00:49:01.964 --> 00:49:03.765
What does that mean?

00:49:05.165 --> 00:49:09.165
God appeared to me
and told me to build an ark.

00:49:09.265 --> 00:49:13.166
He said there was going to be a flood
and that I should be prepared.

00:49:13.266 --> 00:49:15.766
Whenever I shave,
my beard grows right back out.

00:49:15.766 --> 00:49:20.867
My hair grows longer every day.
This robe... God sent me the robe.

00:49:20.867 --> 00:49:22.267
He thought
it would be funny.

00:49:23.268 --> 00:49:28.068
I actually think it's really comfortable.
That's why I'm wearing it.

00:49:29.769 --> 00:49:32.269
The beard, the robe.

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:34.869
You're Noah?

00:49:36.370 --> 00:49:37.970
Yeah, kind of.

00:49:38.070 --> 00:49:39.070
Mom!

00:49:39.170 --> 00:49:40.470
Not now, Noah!

00:49:42.171 --> 00:49:43.271
Dylan.

00:49:43.271 --> 00:49:44.371
Okay.

00:49:47.872 --> 00:49:51.372
We left everything behind
to come here.

00:49:51.472 --> 00:49:55.173
Maybe that's put too much pressure
on you. I don't know.

00:49:55.273 --> 00:49:59.773
But this has got to stop.
Please. You're scaring me.

00:49:59.873 --> 00:50:04.474
The boys need their father back,
and I need my husband back.

00:50:21.777 --> 00:50:24.677
Yes. Successful. Powerful.
Handsome. Happy.

00:50:24.777 --> 00:50:27.578
Successful. Powerful.
Handsome. Happy.

00:50:37.179 --> 00:50:38.680
Good morning!

00:50:43.580 --> 00:50:44.580
Cold today, huh?

00:50:44.981 --> 00:50:45.981
Hmm?

00:50:56.582 --> 00:50:57.883
"Back to work"?

00:51:01.383 --> 00:51:07.084
Okay. All right. You want me
to wear the robe? I'll wear the robe.

00:51:08.084 --> 00:51:11.385
Two can play this game.

00:51:19.186 --> 00:51:20.386
Ha, ha, ha!

00:51:22.086 --> 00:51:24.087
Piece de resistance.

00:51:25.987 --> 00:51:28.087
The student
has become the teacher.

00:51:32.888 --> 00:51:34.388
This meeting
will come to order.

00:51:34.488 --> 00:51:35.689
Rita, any sign of him?

00:51:35.789 --> 00:51:38.089
Marty, I told you,
I will let you know as soon...

00:51:38.189 --> 00:51:41.489
Okay, you know what? You got me.
He's here. We're in the middle of a yoga class.

00:51:41.489 --> 00:51:43.390
Rita, this is no time for jokes.
I'm not kidding.

00:51:43.490 --> 00:51:45.790
If he's not in that meeting,
we're all out of a job.

00:51:45.890 --> 00:51:48.090
Wait a minute.
Let me finish my sun salutation.

00:51:53.491 --> 00:51:55.792
Marty! Sorry I'm late.
Come on, let's go.

00:51:56.792 --> 00:51:58.992
What is that?

00:51:59.092 --> 00:52:02.693
Making lemonade out of lemons.
Pick up your phone! Come on!

00:52:02.793 --> 00:52:06.093
At its heart,
this bill gives private citizens access

00:52:06.193 --> 00:52:08.194
to lands they technically
already own.

00:52:08.294 --> 00:52:09.894
Will the Chairman yield?

00:52:09.994 --> 00:52:10.994
Oh, look,
there he is.

00:52:11.094 --> 00:52:12.294
Yup, yup, I see him.

00:52:12.294 --> 00:52:16.295
Access is just a word you're using
to hide what's really going on here.

00:52:16.295 --> 00:52:18.895
This is about development,
short and simple.

00:52:18.995 --> 00:52:24.096
Evan, what are you doing?
You have a pony tail on your face!

00:52:24.196 --> 00:52:26.597
What you gonna do next?
Cornrow your eyebrows?

00:52:26.597 --> 00:52:29.297
Development means
the advancement of jobs,

00:52:29.397 --> 00:52:32.998
an increase in domestic commerce.
If you happen to like those things,

00:52:33.098 --> 00:52:37.398
I invite you to join myself and
my cosponsors, Congressman Dodd,

00:52:39.599 --> 00:52:41.599
Congressman Hughes...

00:52:42.899 --> 00:52:44.599
and Congressman Baxter.

00:53:05.903 --> 00:53:07.903
Did you just do
a wardrobe change?

00:53:08.003 --> 00:53:11.004
What do you think this is,
the Oscars? You are not Whoopi.

00:53:12.204 --> 00:53:14.604
Ladies and gentlemen!
Please!

00:53:15.804 --> 00:53:19.805
Please! Congressman Baxter has
a tendency to embrace the theatrical

00:53:19.905 --> 00:53:22.605
in his support of this bill.
Congressman, let me warn you,

00:53:22.605 --> 00:53:26.206
you are approximately 10 seconds away
from committee censure.

00:53:26.306 --> 00:53:29.507
Oh, no. Hey, would anyone mind
if I close the window?

00:53:59.011 --> 00:54:02.812
Ladies and gentlemen! Please!
These animals are trained!

00:54:03.312 --> 00:54:05.112
I've seen
this circus act before!

00:54:05.112 --> 00:54:08.113
Congressman, I'm sure St. Francis
would be... envious.

00:54:08.213 --> 00:54:11.813
We, however, are not.
You have five seconds.

00:54:11.813 --> 00:54:14.714
You march yourself and your
little animal troupe out of here now

00:54:14.714 --> 00:54:16.614
or you will be
forcibly removed.

00:54:16.714 --> 00:54:18.614
I'm afraid
I can't do that, sir.

00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:20.114
Congressman!

00:54:20.215 --> 00:54:22.415
These animals...
are not trained.

00:54:22.515 --> 00:54:23.815
Congressman!

00:54:24.715 --> 00:54:26.215
I think they want me
to save them!

00:54:26.215 --> 00:54:28.816
Save them...
from what, Congressman?

00:54:29.016 --> 00:54:32.316
Saving the animals, okay.
I can roll with that. That's a good idea.

00:54:40.118 --> 00:54:41.118
The flood.

00:54:41.518 --> 00:54:44.018
A flood? Rolling out.

00:54:44.518 --> 00:54:45.819
The flood.

00:54:45.919 --> 00:54:48.019
This has been the hottest,
driest summer on record

00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:49.819
and you say we're gonna
have a flood?

00:54:49.819 --> 00:54:51.119
When might we expect this?

00:54:51.219 --> 00:54:53.320
September 22, midday.

00:54:57.220 --> 00:54:58.721
That's what I was told.

00:54:58.821 --> 00:55:00.821
Might I ask who told you?

00:55:07.722 --> 00:55:11.523
Not in front of all those people.
Don't say it. Don't say it.

00:55:16.623 --> 00:55:17.924
God.

00:55:22.724 --> 00:55:25.525
God? You talk to God?

00:55:26.225 --> 00:55:27.425
Yes.

00:55:27.525 --> 00:55:28.725
And God is talking back?

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:32.526
Yeah. We hung out a little.

00:55:32.626 --> 00:55:34.926
Well, time to update
the resume.

00:55:34.926 --> 00:55:37.327
Congressman, your name is being
removed from this bill.

00:55:37.427 --> 00:55:40.927
Obviously, the stresses of this office
have proven too much for you.

00:55:40.927 --> 00:55:42.327
Please have the congressman
removed.

00:55:42.427 --> 00:55:44.228
No. Please!
You don't understand!

00:55:44.328 --> 00:55:47.128
God commanded me
to build an ark!

00:55:47.228 --> 00:55:49.829
It's going to rain!
There's going to be a flood!

00:55:51.229 --> 00:55:52.729
Remove him now!

00:55:52.829 --> 00:55:55.230
We have to prepare ourselves!

00:55:55.330 --> 00:55:58.030
I need to finish the ark!

00:55:59.230 --> 00:56:00.830
Remove him now!

00:56:07.831 --> 00:56:09.732
Does this mean
we're moving back home?

00:56:10.732 --> 00:56:13.432
Home, Canada.
One or the other.

00:56:23.934 --> 00:56:28.835
Joan? I know you probably saw
what happened, but I can explain.

00:56:33.135 --> 00:56:35.736
Take the stuff to the car, guys.
I'll be there in a minute.

00:56:38.736 --> 00:56:39.837
Guys?

00:56:43.437 --> 00:56:48.538
I'm gonna take them to my mother's.
Evan, I... think you need help.

00:56:49.138 --> 00:56:53.939
Joan, please. I'm not doing this.
It's not me. It's Him.

00:56:53.939 --> 00:56:57.339
I went to that meeting in a suit,
and he took it off of me.

00:56:57.339 --> 00:57:01.140
Those animals... are following me
because of Him.

00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.840
God? Does God know
he's destroying our lives?

00:57:04.941 --> 00:57:07.441
Does... God know
he's gonna get you fired?

00:57:07.541 --> 00:57:09.341
Yeah! He's trying
to get me fired!

00:57:10.141 --> 00:57:13.242
He is trying
to get me fired!

00:57:13.342 --> 00:57:15.542
That way I'll have more time
to work on the ark!

00:57:15.542 --> 00:57:18.043
Because the rain
and the floods are coming.

00:57:18.143 --> 00:57:21.643
No, I heard you, Evan.
The whole world heard you.

00:57:21.643 --> 00:57:24.344
Joan, please,
you gotta believe me.

00:57:26.744 --> 00:57:31.545
There it is! It's happening!
It's happening! It's raining!

00:57:49.047 --> 00:57:50.248
Goodbye, Evan.

00:57:53.948 --> 00:57:55.048
Joan!

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:08.351
I know! I know. Whatever you do,
you do because you love me!

00:58:16.152 --> 00:58:18.952
Do me a favor.
Love me less.

00:58:20.352 --> 00:58:21.453
Congressman!

00:58:21.453 --> 00:58:24.453
Are you concerned at all
about Congressman Baxter's tirade

00:58:24.553 --> 00:58:26.153
and the adverse effects
it may have on your bill?

00:58:26.253 --> 00:58:30.054
The day it rains and floods and
Congressman Baxter takes a ride on his ark,

00:58:30.154 --> 00:58:32.154
that'll be the day
I'll be concerned. Thank you.

00:58:37.255 --> 00:58:41.556
His name is Evan Baxter,
but now he goes by "New York's Noah",

00:58:41.656 --> 00:58:45.356
"Heaven's Evan",
"The Weirdo with a Beardo".

00:58:50.257 --> 00:58:53.958
Okay, guys. Watch it. Watch it.
Coming through. Watch your back.

00:58:55.558 --> 00:58:59.259
Marty, will you comment on Congressman
Baxter's change of appearance?

00:58:59.559 --> 00:59:03.459
Yes, his hair is long.
Yes, his beard is unshaven.

00:59:03.559 --> 00:59:05.760
Are you equally stunned
by this man's appearance?

00:59:12.161 --> 00:59:13.361
The way things
go around here,

00:59:13.361 --> 00:59:16.161
if he gets any crazier,
we may end up in the White House.

00:59:22.462 --> 00:59:25.163
Hey! No, no, no, no, no!
That's my cup!

00:59:26.763 --> 00:59:28.063
Whatever.

00:59:48.866 --> 00:59:52.367
He's filling the boat with
two of every kind of animal.

00:59:52.467 --> 00:59:55.867
Still to be collected,
two giraffes, two elephants...

00:59:56.868 --> 00:59:58.468
and one more jackass.

01:00:01.768 --> 01:00:02.869
What an idiot.

01:00:02.869 --> 01:00:04.369
He's a mook.

01:00:04.469 --> 01:00:05.669
Jerks.

01:00:06.669 --> 01:00:09.270
Don't worry about it, you guys.
Come on, eat up.

01:00:09.370 --> 01:00:10.370
Not hungry.

01:00:10.470 --> 01:00:11.570
Yeah, me neither.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:13.970
You guys can't eat.
I can't stop.

01:00:14.070 --> 01:00:15.971
- Can I go to the bathroom?
- Me, too.

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.671
Okay. Dylan, go with them.
Please?

01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:19.971
Fine.

01:00:22.132 --> 01:00:24.672
Oh, excuse me.
Can I get a refill, please?

01:00:25.372 --> 01:00:26.472
Coming right up.

01:00:27.372 --> 01:00:28.373
Thank you.

01:00:28.473 --> 01:00:30.173
Excuse me.
Are you all right?

01:00:31.073 --> 01:00:32.073
Yeah.

01:00:33.873 --> 01:00:36.174
No. It's a long story.

01:00:36.274 --> 01:00:37.374
Well, I like stories.

01:00:38.174 --> 01:00:41.175
I'm considered
a bit of a storyteller myself.

01:00:42.275 --> 01:00:44.875
My husband...
Have you heard of "New York's Noah"?

01:00:46.976 --> 01:00:48.676
The guy
who's building the ark.

01:00:48.776 --> 01:00:50.076
That's him.

01:00:50.176 --> 01:00:53.277
I love that story,
Noah and the Ark.

01:00:53.377 --> 01:00:54.977
You know, a lot of people miss
the point of that story.

01:00:55.077 --> 01:00:57.077
They think it's about
God's wrath and anger.

01:00:57.977 --> 01:00:59.778
They love it
when God gets angry.

01:00:59.778 --> 01:01:02.278
What is the story about,
then? The ark?

01:01:02.378 --> 01:01:07.779
Well, I think it's a love story
about believing in each other.

01:01:07.779 --> 01:01:13.480
You know, the animals showed up in pairs.
They stood by each other, side by side,

01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:17.880
just like Noah and his family.
Everybody entered the ark side by side.

01:01:18.981 --> 01:01:21.881
But my husband says
God told him to do it.

01:01:23.681 --> 01:01:25.282
What do you do with that?

01:01:25.382 --> 01:01:27.182
Sounds like an opportunity.

01:01:30.182 --> 01:01:31.483
Let me ask you something.

01:01:32.483 --> 01:01:35.683
If someone prays for patience,
you think God gives them patience?

01:01:36.283 --> 01:01:39.584
Or does he give them...
the opportunity to be patient?

01:01:41.284 --> 01:01:43.384
If they pray for courage,
does God give them courage,

01:01:43.384 --> 01:01:46.085
or does he give them opportunities
to be courageous?

01:01:48.285 --> 01:01:50.686
If someone prayed
for their family to be closer,

01:01:51.886 --> 01:01:54.786
you think God zaps them
with warm, fuzzy feelings?

01:01:55.686 --> 01:01:58.087
Or does he give them opportunities
to love each other?

01:02:01.287 --> 01:02:05.388
Well, I gotta run.
Lot of people to serve. Enjoy.

01:02:12.389 --> 01:02:15.390
<i>Guess this comes as no surprise to
those who remember his campaign promise,</i>

01:02:15.490 --> 01:02:17.290
"I will lower taxes,

01:02:17.690 --> 01:02:19.890
"go crazy and
build a gigantic ark."

01:02:27.991 --> 01:02:29.992
Oh, my gosh.

01:02:34.593 --> 01:02:35.593
Evan!

01:02:35.693 --> 01:02:36.793
Dad?

01:02:36.893 --> 01:02:37.993
Honey!

01:02:38.093 --> 01:02:39.093
Dad?

01:02:39.093 --> 01:02:40.894
You guys, I'm up here.

01:02:58.096 --> 01:03:00.097
- Rough week?
- You look really funny.

01:03:00.197 --> 01:03:01.397
You look really old.

01:03:01.497 --> 01:03:02.997
Yeah, well,
he is really old.

01:03:05.197 --> 01:03:06.398
Why'd you come back?

01:03:06.498 --> 01:03:07.598
It was the kids.

01:03:07.698 --> 01:03:08.554
Tell him, guys.

01:03:08.554 --> 01:03:10.898
We like you better
as the crazy guy.

01:03:10.898 --> 01:03:13.299
You spend time with us
and you're home a lot more.

01:03:13.399 --> 01:03:15.999
Just, please don't make us do
the dance anymore.

01:03:37.602 --> 01:03:42.103
I don't know what's going on,
or what you're going through,

01:03:42.803 --> 01:03:44.604
but we got into this
as a family

01:03:45.483 --> 01:03:48.504
and we're gonna
get out of it... as a family,

01:03:49.404 --> 01:03:51.005
side by side.

01:03:58.506 --> 01:04:01.906
But, Evan, we have to talk
about the ark. It has to come down.

01:04:02.006 --> 01:04:03.307
I can't do that.

01:04:03.407 --> 01:04:04.807
You don't have a choice.

01:04:05.207 --> 01:04:08.807
Congressman Long went to the city.
There's a laundry list of code violations.

01:04:08.807 --> 01:04:11.087
You have until September 22
to... take it down,

01:04:11.087 --> 01:04:13.208
or... they'll take it down
and arrest you.

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.308
September 22.
That's the day of the flood.

01:04:15.408 --> 01:04:16.909
Mom! Dad! Come here!

01:04:42.013 --> 01:04:44.413
Don't you dare
take that ark down.

01:04:47.013 --> 01:04:48.914
How are we gonna do this?

01:04:49.014 --> 01:04:51.214
There's no way the five
of us can finish on time.

01:04:51.314 --> 01:04:53.414
We don't have money
to hire anybody else.

01:04:58.515 --> 01:05:00.416
Is that a llama
with a hammer?

01:05:00.516 --> 01:05:04.016
An alpaca. They rarely spit at people
unless frightened or abused.

01:05:06.517 --> 01:05:07.717
Let's finish this sucker.

01:05:13.018 --> 01:05:14.218
Come on, let's go.

01:05:14.218 --> 01:05:15.618
No one knows
where they came from

01:05:15.718 --> 01:05:17.518
or how the congressman
is getting them to do it,

01:05:17.618 --> 01:05:23.519
but, two by two, animals of all kinds
are working with Godspeed to build this ark.

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.119
Thank you.

01:05:25.219 --> 01:05:28.420
If this flood really
does happen, "Evan help us".

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:31.520
Hey! A little help?

01:05:35.521 --> 01:05:36.521
Thanks.

01:05:37.921 --> 01:05:39.022
Here it is, hon.

01:05:40.322 --> 01:05:43.022
Perfect. Thanks.

01:05:47.023 --> 01:05:48.523
Hold it right there.

01:05:48.623 --> 01:05:52.224
This is Ed Carson coming to you
live from New York Noah's construction site,

01:05:52.224 --> 01:05:57.325
where we are unable to leave the news van
due to hazardous conditions outside.

01:06:00.525 --> 01:06:01.525
- High five.
- High five.

01:06:01.525 --> 01:06:02.525
Good job.

01:06:03.225 --> 01:06:04.926
Hey, putty tat.

01:06:08.926 --> 01:06:11.827
Go, go, go!
He tried to eat me!

01:06:12.127 --> 01:06:14.827
Dylan! Jordan! Check it out!
Your mom's building an ark!

01:06:14.927 --> 01:06:16.228
Let's do the dance.

01:06:16.328 --> 01:06:18.328
No, please, No.

01:06:21.028 --> 01:06:22.929
Well, where did
the animals come from, then?

01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:24.129
Please. It's a trick.

01:06:24.229 --> 01:06:25.629
It's a circus
is what it is.

01:06:25.729 --> 01:06:28.830
Wild animals running amok
in suburban Virginia.

01:06:28.830 --> 01:06:32.530
With all these species,
what's being done about the feces?

01:06:38.631 --> 01:06:43.932
Evan Baxter! You have gone from newsman
to congressman to... caveman.

01:06:44.032 --> 01:06:46.532
What makes you so sure
God chose you?

01:06:47.833 --> 01:06:49.533
He chose all of us.

01:06:58.934 --> 01:07:00.835
Time to wash up,
you guys.

01:07:07.436 --> 01:07:08.636
Thanks.

01:07:12.036 --> 01:07:13.537
You want some?

01:07:33.476 --> 01:07:36.444
Why couldn't the man
just buy a Corvette?

01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:40.800
Well, well, well. There they are.
It is good to see you guys.

01:07:40.800 --> 01:07:46.100
It's good to see you! Your hair looks great.
It's very regal. Man, I love your hair!

01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:47.842
And you're still sucking up.

01:07:47.942 --> 01:07:48.942
So, why are you here?

01:07:49.042 --> 01:07:50.142
Long locked us out.

01:07:50.242 --> 01:07:51.243
He can't do that.

01:07:51.343 --> 01:07:53.543
I mean, I've been suspended,
but I'm still a congressman.

01:07:53.643 --> 01:07:54.743
Rita, tell him
what you know.

01:07:54.843 --> 01:07:55.843
Tell me what?

01:07:55.943 --> 01:07:58.744
I smelled a rat the second
we got that office.

01:07:58.844 --> 01:08:00.844
You don't get an office
like that for nothing.

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:04.145
So I had the stalker here
do some research.

01:08:04.145 --> 01:08:05.345
Okay, Eugene, talk.

01:08:05.745 --> 01:08:07.292
Prestige Crest used to be
federal lands,

01:08:07.292 --> 01:08:10.546
but... what's interesting is
how it got into private hands.

01:08:10.546 --> 01:08:12.946
Congressman Long got
the approval to build a dam

01:08:13.046 --> 01:08:15.946
and then passed out the surrounding lands
to a group of private investors.

01:08:16.046 --> 01:08:17.347
Now, the locals fought
this thing for years.

01:08:17.447 --> 01:08:19.647
They said Long and his developer buddies
were cutting corners,

01:08:19.747 --> 01:08:22.047
like skipping important
building code checkpoints.

01:08:22.047 --> 01:08:25.148
And with the land use bill, he's gonna do
the same thing with the national parks.

01:08:25.248 --> 01:08:28.948
So, you stand by and shake your pom-poms
while Long and his buddies get rich.

01:08:29.048 --> 01:08:31.149
What can we do?
I'm suspended.

01:08:31.249 --> 01:08:34.649
Go back to the Hill and show them
that you can and will fight this bill.

01:08:34.749 --> 01:08:37.750
You guys, I'm sorry. I can't do that.
I have to get back to the ark.

01:08:37.750 --> 01:08:39.450
The ark? All right. Okay.

01:08:39.550 --> 01:08:41.450
God told you to build an ark?
- Yes.

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:44.551
But did he tell you to make your friends
believe in you and follow you here

01:08:44.651 --> 01:08:47.751
so you can make us look stupid?
Cause I go to church every Sunday.

01:08:48.678 --> 01:08:50.252
Okay, every other Sunday.

01:08:51.252 --> 01:08:54.587
I've been to church! And that
does not sound like God to me.

01:08:54.587 --> 01:08:57.028
Rita, I know that this
doesn't make any sense.

01:08:57.028 --> 01:08:59.754
I just want you to trust me.
You just have to have faith.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:04.362
Evan, faith will not fight this bill.
The CINPLAN vote is today!

01:09:04.362 --> 01:09:08.207
If we're gonna stop this thing,
you need to get down to Capitol Hill now!

01:09:08.207 --> 01:09:09.619
Otherwise, it's impossible!

01:09:09.619 --> 01:09:13.216
Dad, dad,
I think it's done.

01:10:11.234 --> 01:10:15.665
What in the world? I can't even
get my cat to use the litter box.

01:10:57.072 --> 01:11:00.834
It's September 22, and
we're all still here.

01:11:01.218 --> 01:11:02.893
Awkward!

01:11:02.905 --> 01:11:06.071
People!
The flood is imminent!

01:11:06.071 --> 01:11:10.274
Board the ark!
Save yourselves!

01:11:10.374 --> 01:11:11.774
Get down, you fool!

01:11:12.274 --> 01:11:16.275
Listen to me!
The time has come!

01:11:16.375 --> 01:11:20.476
No, Captain Ahab!
Your time has come!

01:11:21.776 --> 01:11:26.476
Yeah, Baxter! The weather's 70
and sunny with a chance of crazy!

01:11:31.877 --> 01:11:36.078
Do you hear that?
The rains are upon us!

01:11:36.178 --> 01:11:37.878
Dad, I don't think
that's the rains.

01:11:42.279 --> 01:11:44.979
Hey, Baxter!
Kiss your ark goodbye!

01:11:57.381 --> 01:11:57.794
Where is he?

01:11:57.794 --> 01:11:59.209
On the boat, sir.

01:12:00.147 --> 01:12:02.330
Gimme a minute.
Lets see if I can convince "Noah"

01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:04.646
that the world doesn't
have to end today.

01:12:08.683 --> 01:12:11.533
I gotta hand it to you,
this is quite the show.

01:12:11.533 --> 01:12:14.474
According to my source,
the show hasn't even started yet.

01:12:14.474 --> 01:12:16.188
Still expecting the big flood.

01:12:16.188 --> 01:12:18.632
You know, voters don't respond
to the gloom and doom stuff.

01:12:18.632 --> 01:12:20.075
They like
a more positive message.

01:12:20.075 --> 01:12:21.801
Like the one
you're sending with your bill?

01:12:21.801 --> 01:12:23.869
How much did you
make off of all this land?

01:12:23.869 --> 01:12:27.267
You are destroying
our national parks for profit.

01:12:27.267 --> 01:12:29.267
You have a problem with
somebody taking a little profit?

01:12:29.267 --> 01:12:30.844
It's called business, son.

01:12:30.844 --> 01:12:33.279
So if I need to get a message out there,
or get a congressman elected

01:12:33.279 --> 01:12:37.517
there are people who pay for it, and yes,
those people want this bill to happen

01:12:37.517 --> 01:12:41.592
and, by God, it's gonna happen.
Now you look down there.

01:12:42.064 --> 01:12:43.639
Those are the wolves, son.

01:12:43.857 --> 01:12:47.215
I'm gonna give you one last chance.
Take down this boat.

01:12:47.215 --> 01:12:51.488
I'm giving you one last chance.
Repent.

01:12:52.289 --> 01:12:56.099
Such a shame.
You had possibilities.

01:12:56.217 --> 01:13:00.105
But you wanna stop progress
to save the Earth. Go for it.

01:13:00.105 --> 01:13:02.645
Good luck getting a tree
to come to the polls.

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:09.342
Take it down.

01:13:16.781 --> 01:13:20.184
<i>This is a court order approving
the demolition of this boat!</i>

01:13:20.184 --> 01:13:23.364
<i>Evacuate immediately!
You have three minutes!</i>

01:13:25.857 --> 01:13:30.323
Honey. We have to go.
They're gonna destroy the boat.

01:13:30.824 --> 01:13:31.717
No.

01:13:32.827 --> 01:13:34.751
It can't end this way.

01:13:36.183 --> 01:13:40.728
Is it too much to ask
for a little precipitation?

01:13:41.385 --> 01:13:45.125
Honey, maybe God
didn't mean a literal flood.

01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:50.435
Maybe He meant a flood of...
knowledge or... emotion or awareness.

01:13:50.453 --> 01:13:51.804
If that's true,

01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:56.386
I am going
to be so pissed.

01:13:56.454 --> 01:13:57.780
<i>Two minutes!</i>

01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:01.323
<i>Get off the boat now
or you will be removed by force.</i>

01:14:01.323 --> 01:14:04.943
Evan, you did it.
You built the ark.

01:14:04.943 --> 01:14:06.411
That's all you
were asked to do, right?

01:14:06.411 --> 01:14:07.364
No.

01:14:07.799 --> 01:14:12.261
There's something else. Something's
going to happen. I can feel it.

01:14:12.261 --> 01:14:15.144
Yeah, what's gonna happen is
tear gas and a wrecking ball.

01:14:15.144 --> 01:14:16.863
Evan, think of the kids.

01:14:18.192 --> 01:14:19.888
<i>One minute!</i>

01:14:21.794 --> 01:14:23.544
Dad, whatever you say,
I'm with you.

01:14:23.544 --> 01:14:25.056
Yeah, me, too.

01:14:25.056 --> 01:14:27.656
Me, too. But... can we keep
some of the animals?

01:14:27.656 --> 01:14:29.844
I like the alpaca.
He spits.

01:14:34.363 --> 01:14:38.122
You're right. We did it.
We built the boat.

01:14:38.419 --> 01:14:39.481
Yeah.

01:14:40.003 --> 01:14:42.662
Let's go.
Let's go, guys. Come on.

01:14:56.010 --> 01:14:57.213
Well, I guess
they don't wannna go.

01:14:57.213 --> 01:14:58.789
It's their instinct.

01:14:58.789 --> 01:15:00.192
What do you mean, hon?

01:15:00.445 --> 01:15:05.278
Some animals know when weather's coming.
When they feel it coming, they sit.

01:15:13.646 --> 01:15:14.858
Joan!

01:15:24.041 --> 01:15:26.503
<i>Okay. Time's up!
We're coming in!</i>

01:15:26.503 --> 01:15:29.659
Get that ball in position!
We're clearing them out!

01:15:41.217 --> 01:15:44.135
Is that rain?
It's raining.

01:15:44.135 --> 01:15:47.288
Lucky guess, Baxter.
Lucky guess.

01:16:03.360 --> 01:16:07.002
Looks like the drought's finally over.
Good news, eh, Congressman?

01:16:07.431 --> 01:16:10.069
Yeah. Good news.

01:16:12.284 --> 01:16:18.419
Everybody! Please!
Get on the ark!

01:16:20.123 --> 01:16:21.285
Go to the car!

01:16:21.407 --> 01:16:25.529
Please! Everyone!
On the ark!

01:16:25.529 --> 01:16:29.092
Cover me up! Keep me dry!
Cover me up! Keep me dry!

01:16:29.324 --> 01:16:33.325
Who's crazy now, huh?
Look at us all squishing!

01:16:41.111 --> 01:16:43.126
It kind of stopped raining.

01:16:43.226 --> 01:16:44.070
Is that it?

01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:46.567
What did I tell you?
It's fine. It's over.

01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:49.057
Hey, Ahab! This is it?

01:16:49.204 --> 01:16:52.392
Your God experiencing
a little water shortage?

01:16:52.917 --> 01:16:56.218
It would appear Evan Baxter
was right about the rain,

01:16:56.450 --> 01:17:00.719
with a slight miscalculation
as to the quantity.

01:17:04.314 --> 01:17:05.692
Something's wrong.

01:17:05.838 --> 01:17:07.679
Honey,
the clouds are moving away.

01:17:07.679 --> 01:17:10.756
No, no.
No, this isn't right.

01:17:11.366 --> 01:17:14.855
Evan, even if it kept raining,
it's not like it could cause a flood in a day.

01:17:14.855 --> 01:17:19.977
But today is the day! It has to be.
This just doesn't make any sense!

01:17:22.433 --> 01:17:23.533
Wait a second.

01:17:23.633 --> 01:17:24.271
What... what is it?

01:17:24.271 --> 01:17:27.949
Marty said that Long cut corners,
violated building codes.

01:17:27.949 --> 01:17:28.807
What are you talking about?

01:17:28.807 --> 01:17:30.811
The lake, Long Lake.

01:17:30.811 --> 01:17:35.006
It's named after him.
It's the lake! It's the lake!

01:17:48.237 --> 01:17:49.364
Oh, no.

01:17:51.081 --> 01:17:55.683
Get on the ark!
Everyone, on the ark... now!

01:17:55.683 --> 01:17:57.547
I think
we should get on the ark.

01:17:57.605 --> 01:18:00.500
I agree. I think
we should get on the ark also.

01:18:00.512 --> 01:18:04.039
I'm cold. I'm wet.
I'm going home.

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:13.359
Ladies first! Move!

01:18:21.251 --> 01:18:25.566
Oh, my God. This is happening.
This is really happening.

01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:29.220
Holy... Get everyone
on the ark now!

01:18:29.220 --> 01:18:32.494
Get on the ark now! Let's go!
Get on the ark! Let's go! Go!

01:18:32.544 --> 01:18:35.311
Go, go, go, go!
Get on the ark!

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:41.145
Go, go, go! On the ark!
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:18:41.245 --> 01:18:43.282
All right, boys!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:18:43.384 --> 01:18:47.455
We're gonna need a bigger boat.
Stay here with the kids.

01:18:56.277 --> 01:18:57.247
Come on, Rita!

01:18:57.763 --> 01:19:02.106
Everyone, up the ramp! Onto the deck!
Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

01:19:02.106 --> 01:19:04.209
Dylan, get back inside!
It's too dangerous.

01:19:04.209 --> 01:19:06.393
No, dad.
I told you, I'm with you.

01:19:10.394 --> 01:19:13.379
Careful, everyone.
In the ark! In the ark!

01:19:13.750 --> 01:19:16.024
Watch your step!
Up the ramp, everybody!

01:19:23.723 --> 01:19:24.676
Guys, help me
with the door!

01:19:24.676 --> 01:19:26.122
Get the door! Get the door!

01:20:08.711 --> 01:20:10.306
Guys! Guys!

01:20:43.449 --> 01:20:45.458
Everybody hang on!

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.907
You guys all right?
You okay?

01:20:59.132 --> 01:21:00.778
<i>There's been a flood
at Prestige Crest</i>

01:21:00.778 --> 01:21:03.121
<i>and you're seeing live images
of New York Noah's ark</i>

01:21:03.121 --> 01:21:06.868
<i>caught in the storm surge and
heading towards Memorial Bridge!</i>

01:21:14.288 --> 01:21:15.223
We're gonna crash!

01:21:15.223 --> 01:21:16.721
Turn this thing around!

01:21:16.721 --> 01:21:18.242
We're not gonna make it!

01:21:18.242 --> 01:21:20.139
Save us, Baxter!

01:21:31.521 --> 01:21:36.076
I command thee halt!
Stop! Whoa!

01:21:36.076 --> 01:21:38.040
It's not working!

01:21:38.407 --> 01:21:41.445
How about a little help here?

01:22:27.455 --> 01:22:29.621
What do you mean there was water damage?
It rained for ten minutes.

01:22:29.621 --> 01:22:31.551
That is not possible.

01:22:41.152 --> 01:22:42.903
- I love you guys.
- All right.

01:22:42.903 --> 01:22:44.397
- Seriously.
- Okay, I got it.

01:22:44.397 --> 01:22:45.933
- I love you.
- Thank you.

01:23:03.161 --> 01:23:07.838
All those in favor of the Public Land
Act, please signify by saying "Aye".

01:23:14.814 --> 01:23:16.118
Good God!

01:23:51.335 --> 01:23:53.366
I think
we can walk from here.

01:24:10.976 --> 01:24:15.937
Hello, Congressman. Mind if I...
park my boat here for a little while?

01:24:16.998 --> 01:24:17.553
But how...?

01:24:17.553 --> 01:24:18.996
The dam, Congressman.

01:24:18.996 --> 01:24:22.591
Your reservoir ruptured.
Prestige Crest, it's all gone.

01:24:22.591 --> 01:24:24.878
No. They said
that couldn't happen.

01:24:26.144 --> 01:24:27.805
I never thought this...

01:24:28.722 --> 01:24:34.251
You. You did this to me.
You set me up, you crazy son of a...

01:24:37.049 --> 01:24:39.935
Wow.
That is disgusting.

01:24:40.077 --> 01:24:41.352
If that comes out your front,

01:24:41.352 --> 01:24:43.857
I don't even wanna know
what's coming out the back.

01:24:48.017 --> 01:24:50.426
Don't look down, Congressman,
but the wolves are here,

01:24:50.464 --> 01:24:54.724
although I wouldn't worry so much
about these wolves as those.

01:25:02.888 --> 01:25:04.273
Gesundheit.

01:25:16.184 --> 01:25:19.860
As you can see behind me,
New York Noah's prediction came true.

01:25:19.860 --> 01:25:22.492
The vote of the Land Act Bill
has been suspended,

01:25:22.492 --> 01:25:25.483
pending investigation of
Congressman Long for profiteering.

01:25:25.483 --> 01:25:28.567
Of course now, the question is,
how will these animals be returned

01:25:28.567 --> 01:25:30.307
to their natural habitats?

01:25:30.316 --> 01:25:34.066
Something tells me, if God got them here,
He can probably get them home.

01:25:34.066 --> 01:25:37.266
The House will undoubtedly
reinstate Congressman Baxter

01:25:37.266 --> 01:25:39.187
when it reconvenes
in the morning.

01:25:39.187 --> 01:25:42.784
Until then, there is a lot
to be done here on Capitol Hill.

01:25:42.784 --> 01:25:44.071
How's Buster doing?

01:25:44.071 --> 01:25:45.295
Come on, Buster.

01:25:45.373 --> 01:25:48.012
- No, come on. Come on!
- Come on!

01:25:48.112 --> 01:25:49.193
- These too heavy? It's all right?
- No, it's fine.

01:25:49.193 --> 01:25:50.393
He can't keep up.

01:25:50.517 --> 01:25:51.995
I know, sweetie!

01:25:51.995 --> 01:25:55.312
All right. What do you say
we take a little break?

01:25:55.312 --> 01:25:57.201
We've only been walking
for, like, five minutes, dad.

01:25:57.201 --> 01:26:00.225
Well, five on, five off.
Life is about balance, right?

01:26:00.225 --> 01:26:01.690
How 'bout some sandwiches?
- Okay.

01:26:01.690 --> 01:26:03.715
Who wants sandwiches?
Let's do it!

01:26:03.815 --> 01:26:04.310
I get first dibs!

01:26:04.310 --> 01:26:07.218
Everyone but Buster
is going to get a sandwich.

01:26:07.218 --> 01:26:11.521
You do not get a sandwich!
You're a dog and...

01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:14.698
Buster is part of the family now.
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

01:26:14.698 --> 01:26:16.665
Poor Buster!

01:26:17.557 --> 01:26:20.662
Honey, come here.
Sweetheart, be careful. Come here.

01:26:20.662 --> 01:26:22.657
- Hey, hon, save me one, okay?
- Okay.

01:26:22.657 --> 01:26:23.801
I'll be right back.

01:26:32.241 --> 01:26:34.048
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:26:35.484 --> 01:26:37.055
What are you doing here?

01:26:37.886 --> 01:26:40.109
Just hanging out
with some old friends.

01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:43.665
You knew all along, didn't you?
You knew the dam was unstable....

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:47.094
If it hadn't been for the ark,
my family, the neighbors...

01:26:47.479 --> 01:26:49.779
I fought you
every step of the way.

01:26:49.779 --> 01:26:51.924
Yes, but you did it.

01:26:52.181 --> 01:26:56.978
So, you had nothing to do with the flood?
Like... where the ark landed exactly?

01:26:56.978 --> 01:27:00.731
I gave you a little shove
at the end. Sue me.

01:27:02.967 --> 01:27:06.325
You did good, son.
You changed the world.

01:27:06.724 --> 01:27:08.526
No, no, I didn't.

01:27:08.526 --> 01:27:09.301
Well, let's see.

01:27:09.301 --> 01:27:13.397
Spending time with your family,
making them very happy.

01:27:13.696 --> 01:27:15.587
Gave that dog a home.

01:27:15.727 --> 01:27:17.178
Right. So?

01:27:17.585 --> 01:27:18.656
So?

01:27:19.372 --> 01:27:21.480
How do we change the world?

01:27:23.152 --> 01:27:26.788
One act of random kindness
at a time.

01:27:26.788 --> 01:27:31.729
One act of random kindness.

01:27:31.829 --> 01:27:33.071
Wow.

01:27:36.606 --> 01:27:38.007
It's time.

01:27:39.736 --> 01:27:41.443
Do the dance.

01:27:42.582 --> 01:27:44.414
Care to join me?

01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:43.332
I now issue
a new commandment,

01:28:43.632 --> 01:28:46.210
"Thou shalt do the dance".

01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:51.325
Stop it!
This is stupid!

01:29:51.325 --> 01:29:55.090
That's awful dancing!
You better stop!

01:30:33.157 --> 01:30:34.703
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
you don't have to go home.</i>

01:30:34.703 --> 01:30:37.598
<i>You just have to go.
We are wrapped.</i>

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:40.896
<i>We're wrapped.
We love you. Thank you.</i>

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:44.114
