01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.312
You take care of him.

No!

917
01:20:16.270 --> 01:20:17.271
Papa!

918
01:20:18.731 --> 01:20:20.699
No!

919
01:20:31.952 --> 01:20:34.080

Which markets are
you at this week?

941

WOMAN:
Portobello Road next.

942
01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.207
See you there?

943
01:23:29.213 --> 01:23:30.214
Beautiful.

01:23:34.176 --> 01:23:35.928
The flowers, my lady.

Where are you from?

947
01:23:41.892 --> 01:23:43.690
A long way from here.

948
01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:51.026
Well, good night.

"Why think separately

"when one is born
from the last?"

951
01:24:04.665 --> 01:24:06.133
That's my favorite poem.

952
01:24:06.959 --> 01:24:09.337
It speaks to you
of yearning,

953
01:24:09.419 --> 01:24:11.968
of one soul
pleading for another.

954
01:24:16.635 --> 01:24:18.137
I'm Mina.
