00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're going to just touch you up.</font>

3
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, Mr. Dorchen?
- Hey.</font>

4
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I need nipple rouge?</font>

5
00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:46.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we get... I don't...</font>

6
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do I need any nipple rouge?</font>

7
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Touch up his nipples, please.</font>

8
00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What kind of brush is that?
Is that rabbit fur?</font>

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou Dorchen, the legendary lead singer</font>

10
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of metal supergroup Motley Lue,</font>

11
00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who burst onto the world stage
out of nowhere</font>

12
00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to become the very definition
of a rock god.</font>

13
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Livin' the dream with
high school sweetheart Kelly Dorchen.</font>

14
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So how did the ultimate party
animal get the inspiration</font>

15
00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to build the most innovative,
forward-thinking</font>

16
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">tech company in the world?</font>

17
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't have to tell you where I got
my inspiration from, first of all.</font>

18
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because that's called
"intellectual property"</font>

19
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I can copyright that shit.</font>

20
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like I copyrighted the word "well,"</font>

21
00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can't even say "well"
without paying me money.</font>

22
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well...
- You owe me money.</font>

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever since I wrote Let's Get It Started
back in '86,</font>

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.247

30
00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.564

I take from a lot of artists.</font>

31
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Take my inspiration
from a lot of artists.</font>

32
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't...</font>

33
00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't take their stuff.</font>

34
00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's... Who would do that?</font>

35
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah. Ask me anything.
- Okay.</font>

36
00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How's your relationship
with your father?</font>

37
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to talk about that.</font>

38
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.409
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still struggling to find his own place

41
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He couldn't invent his way
out of a fucking paper bag.</font>

42
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that's...
That's not a turn of phrase,</font>

43
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's anecdotal evidence.</font>

44
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He got caught in a giant paper
bag a couple weeks ago.</font>

he's off on an experiential journey.</font>

50
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a feeling we'll see him again.</font>

51
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a feeling.</font>

52
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just came to me.</font>

53
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One fateful ski trip in 1986</font>

54
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">seemed to kick-start
their lives into high gear.</font>

55
00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But what was it like to grow up</font>

56
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">alongside these future stars?</font>

57
00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We turned to high school pal,
Gary Winkle.</font>

58
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet you guys didn't know that I was
supposed to go on that trip, huh?</font>

59
00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stood outside all day,</font>

60
00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but they never showed. Left me hanging.</font>

61
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I got that weekend?</font>

62
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chlamydia from the batting cages.</font>

63
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My best buddies go up
the mountain as regular Joes.</font>

64
00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come down fucking rich.
I mean, how did that happen?</font>

65
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, at the end of the day,</font>

66
00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just a simple guy like you</font>

67
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who had a couple of great ideas</font>

68
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that happen to make him
a bunch of money. That's it.</font>

69
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, how was I supposed to know</font>

70
00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that it would change the fabric
of our existence? I couldn't.</font>

71
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I couldn't,
unless I had some sort of...</font>

72
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cut! Let's reset. Do it again.</font>

73
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One word, Nick. Fucking amazing...</font>

74
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fuck with my groove, Terry.</font>

75
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.220

- Youngblood.</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Rip off any pop stars lately?</font>

77
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For your information,
today I recorded an original piece.</font>

78
00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

79
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, it was that Lisa Loeb song.</font>

80
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, as much of it as I could remember.</font>

81
00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The lyrics I made up were original.</font>

82
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Nick, I get it.
You don't have any natural talent.</font>

83
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I know is that hot tub
made me a king.</font>

84
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my duty to live up to the throne.</font>

85
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, I can't see you right now,</font>

86
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but I'm gonna assume you're putting
"king" and "throne" in quotes.</font>

87
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

88
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Nick, I'm sorry.
I'm not trying to be a dick.</font>

89
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you coming to Lou's party?</font>

90
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta talk to Courtney.
I'm... I don't know.</font>

91
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How is Courtney?
- You know.</font>

92
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, really? Still fighting?</font>

93
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why don't you just write her
a Josh Groban song?</font>

94
00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

95
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

96
00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cocaine!</font>

97
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck me!</font>

98
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! Oh, my God!</font>

99
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fucking sneak up
on me like that, huh?</font>

100
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:48.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Knock on something.</font>

101
00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You took most of the doors out
and put beads up, Lou.</font>

102
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What am I supposed to fucking knock on?</font>

103
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you want?</font>

104
00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put it down!
What do you want, a round of applause?</font>

105
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Thank you, Jacob, for making sure
we don't starve to death.</font>

106
00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Even though this is
completely ridiculous</font>

107
00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"and inappropriate, what we're doing."
You're welcome, Mom and Dad.</font>

108
00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just happy that you guys are happy.</font>

109
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The fuck are you still doing here?</font>

110
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Today's my birthday, by the way.</font>

111
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Happy Birthday!</font>

112
00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:16.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, thanks, Mom.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah!</font>

113
00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got you... I got you something.
It'll be here tomorrow via FedEx.</font>

114
00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

115
00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Daddy's little buddy is
turning into Daddy's big buddy.</font>

116
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to help you out.
It's not really my birthday.</font>

117
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you know what day it is?</font>

118
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

119
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Enjoy your shit.</font>

120
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The sooner you choke to death on it,
the sooner I get all this.</font>

121
00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any other questions,
or is this interview over?</font>

122
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:47.963
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't let the lack of a door
hit you on the way out.</font>

123
00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He just gets me so mad.</font>

124
00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, who is he?</font>

125
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my butler.</font>

126
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And our son, consequently.</font>

127
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, right.</font>

128
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lisa Loeb?</font>

129
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God. I can't believe
Nick Webber knows</font>

130
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the name of the cat wrangler.</font>

131
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Crazy, right?</font>

132
00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I just have to tell you,
I really love this song so much.</font>

133
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It feels so personal.</font>

134
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:12.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's almost... Violating.</font>

135
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry.</font>

136
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:31.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

137
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nailed it!</font>

138
00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All rise!</font>

139
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Penis Court is now in session!</font>

140
00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The honorable
Judge Lou Dorchen presiding.</font>

141
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Dorchen, could we get
this board meeting started?</font>

142
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Brad, do your thing.</font>

143
00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ladies and gentlemen,
Lougle is at a crossroads.</font>

144
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:59.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did it, guys!
We got to the crossroads!</font>

145
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our competitors, Lycos
and GeoCities, are crushing us.</font>

146
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Those guys are fucking nerds, Brad.</font>

147
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What about Yahoo, huh?
Where are they?</font>

148
00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yahoo? What's Yahoo?</font>

149
00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:09.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Exactly.</font>

150
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As your head of R&D, I have to tell you</font>

151
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that Lougle cannot continue
down this path.</font>

152
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that's why I moved us
to New Orleans, Brad,</font>

153
00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the Silicon Valley of the South.</font>

154
00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:22.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! Shit! Susan, look, turn around.</font>

155
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Turn around, right now!
Susan, quick, quick, quick!</font>

156
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:25.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not going to look, Lou.</font>

157
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Susan, I promise it's not
a dick and balls this time.</font>

158
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I swear to God. Look, look, look!</font>

159
00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:33.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dick and balls!
You looked at a dick and balls!</font>

160
00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:34.360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I burned you.</font>

161
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe I let you talk me
into joining this sinking ship.</font>

162
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was one of Engineering
Quarterly's "30 Under 30."</font>

163
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

164
00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was on track to be "20 Under 40,"</font>

165
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but now I'm "Zero Under Fuck Me"!</font>

166
00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucked me, Lou.</font>

167
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You fucked my whole life.</font>

168
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My brother works at the NSA
and I work for a madman.</font>

169
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mad Man is a great show.</font>

170
00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:57.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes I wish I could just...</font>

171
00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:03.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay.
Looks like you're hungry for an idea.</font>

172
00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So why doesn't Uncle Lou give
you guys a little taste, huh?</font>

173
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:10.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you combine the right
amounts of nitrotrinadium</font>

174
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with specifically heated water
in a specialized basin,</font>

175
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you get the elements
necessary for time travel!</font>

176
00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boom! Shotgun to the dick!</font>

177
00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:27.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be in the lab,
trying to save this company.</font>

178
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

179
00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:46.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are all these people here?
Are we having another seance?</font>

180
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

181
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.560
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every day's a seance, baby.
Every day's a seance.</font>

182
00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:53.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fucking hate you so much, Lou.</font>

183
00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fucking hate you, too, baby.</font>

184
00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Courtney, it's not a big deal.</font>

185
00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, maybe it's not a big deal to you,</font>

186
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but she's my only sister,
and we never go visit her.</font>

187
00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's the Grammys.
- It's always the Grammys.</font>

188
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not always the Grammys.
Sometimes it's the Grammys.</font>

189
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow. Look at you.</font>

190
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every fucking year, Lou?</font>

191
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, enough with this dad stuff.
Call me Lou.</font>

192
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do I have to pretend
to be your butler?</font>

193
00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You are my butler.</font>

194
00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, Lou, just 'cause
my room's near the bar</font>

195
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and I'm good at receiving guests and...</font>

196
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:29.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy fuck, I'm your butler.</font>

197
00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. Hey, Lou, what do you think about,</font>

198
00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:34.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">maybe this summer, you know,
I come work with you at Lougle?</font>

199
00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, this is what I'll do
for you, okay?</font>

200
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If we ever come up with a division where</font>

201
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:41.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you sit on the couch and masturbate
while playing video games,</font>

202
00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:42.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get you an interview.</font>

203
00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You started
an interactive porno division.</font>

204
00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have that.
Even that retarded Venn diagram</font>

205
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you just mentioned, it exists.</font>

206
00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:53.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, you are a key part
of this operation, Jacob.</font>

207
00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

208
00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my chief mixologist!</font>

209
00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you, buddy.</font>

210
00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Courtney. Your tits look fantastic!</font>

211
00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat shit, Lou.</font>

212
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:13.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">She's one of the good ones, man.</font>

213
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Let's get a drink.</font>

214
00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jeez. The place
is like a deathtrap, huh?</font>

215
00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just lousy with statues, and the...</font>

216
00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not a lot of coats, right?
Not a lot of coats.</font>

217
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can I take your jacket?</font>

218
00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:43.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. I'm actually
kind of "on the job" tonight.</font>

219
00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:45.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's my dad's party, he runs Lougle.</font>

220
00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:47.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you do?</font>

221
00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I'm just
kind of a Jack-of-all-trades.</font>

222
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So you're the butler.
- No!</font>

223
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on. Do I look like a butler to you?</font>

224
00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:59.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look exactly like a butler.</font>

225
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn, it's good to see you, man.</font>

226
00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:02.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You, too, buddy.</font>

227
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man. That tub, huh?</font>

228
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really turned it all around.</font>

229
00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the best thing that
ever happened to me.</font>

230
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You ever wish we could
go back for one more dip?</font>

231
00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:17.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, tweak some things?</font>

232
00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Use time travel
for more important reasons.</font>

233
00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too bad the tub is gone.</font>

234
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

235
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Too bad.</font>

236
00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:27.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck.</font>

237
00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

238
00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:31.686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck? Lou...</font>

239
00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:34.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick-nack-paddywhack!
Give a dog a what?</font>

240
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gary Winkle.</font>

241
00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at this.
Look, Lou spilled his drink on me</font>

242
00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:41.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I don't have to talk to you.</font>

243
00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good looking out.</font>

244
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:44.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, just laying it all out there.</font>

245
00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:47.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where are me and you right now
on a scale of, like,</font>

246
00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"dinner and a movie"
to "tropical sex vacation"?</font>

247
00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on the
"It's never, ever going to happen"</font>

248
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:53.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">part of the scale.</font>

249
00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So, like a 4.
- One and a half.</font>

250
00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Minus the half.</font>

251
00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you selling, Gary?</font>

252
00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:01.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? No love for Gary Winkle?</font>

253
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, but it is a sound
investment this time.</font>

254
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you, man.</font>

255
00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.</font>

256
00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:08.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It is only 12 blocks from the river.</font>

257
00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:12.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pristine lot.
You can build an office tower,</font>

258
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">nightclub, combo, whatever the fuck.</font>

259
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care.</font>

260
00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:18.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I get it, man, I get it.
I get it. I'm a loser.</font>

261
00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm always going to be a loser.
I'm not like you guys.</font>

262
00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:23.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't magically turn it all around
after that ski trip.</font>

263
00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:26.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I got is this piece of land,
and I know it's a piece of shit, okay?</font>

264
00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But it's... It can be our piece of shit.</font>

265
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not interested. Pass.</font>

266
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are live!</font>

267
00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:41.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Coming to you
from the heart of the Bayou.</font>

268
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At the height of his career,</font>

269
00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:47.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">worth 2.3 billion dollars,</font>

270
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:53.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">introducing Lou "the Violator"</font>

271
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dorchen!</font>

272
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've grown quite a bit
over the years, haven't we?</font>

273
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:18.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some of us have achieved our dreams.</font>

274
00:14:18.760 --> 00:14:21.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Others have found new dreams to chase.</font>

275
00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, I bet...</font>

276
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I bet there's not a person
in this room who,</font>

277
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:27.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">given the chance
to do it all over again,</font>

278
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would do it any differently. Am I right?</font>

279
00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I right?</font>

280
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you believe that,</font>

281
00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:40.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if you truly believe that
in your heart of hearts,</font>

282
00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">well, then,</font>

283
00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're all a bunch of fucking morons!</font>

284
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:47.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Genius.</font>

285
00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life is about do-overs, okay?</font>

286
00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:53.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And if you see your second chance</font>

287
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">peeking its dick around
a corner, snatch it!</font>

288
00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:59.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Grab it! Take my advice.</font>

289
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at the people
you love most in this world,</font>

290
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then you tell them
to go fuck themselves.</font>

291
00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.242
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because life is about number one.</font>

292
00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Numero Lou-no!</font>

293
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So come on, it's a party, right?</font>

294
00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:17.120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's all get nude and fuck!</font>

295
00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:32.320
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Move!</font>

296
00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:37.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">About time someone manned up
and shot the bastard.</font>

297
00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:41.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Holy shit, he's been shot.
- In the dick!</font>

298
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! It's bad!
Somebody call an ambulance!</font>

299
00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nick.
- Yeah, buddy.</font>

300
00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You got your hand on my penis!
- I'm applying direct pressure!</font>

301
00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You don't have to touch it that hard.
- My hand is acting as a tourniquet!</font>

302
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You work his dick. Whatever. No, no!
Lou, Lou! Stay with me!</font>

303
00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:56.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with me. Look at me. Look at me.
Who shot you?</font>

304
00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:58.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chux... Zedo.</font>

305
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.282
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Chuck Zito? That motherfucker!</font>

306
00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:03.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think he's saying "tuxedo".
- Tuxedo?</font>

307
00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, it hurts so bad.</font>

308
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who the fuck's wearing a tuxedo?</font>

309
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:09.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? What?</font>

310
00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, first of all, this isn't a tuxedo,</font>

311
00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is a morning suit.
It's way more casual.</font>

312
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't you watch Downton Abbey?</font>

313
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I was standing right there beside you!
I didn't fuckin' shoot him!</font>

314
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want my dick back!</font>

315
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou's gonna fuckin' die!
He's out of time!</font>

316
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, he's not.</font>

317
00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll give him more time.</font>

318
00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- Grab his arms.</font>

319
00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:30.689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, I take it back! I take it back!</font>

320
00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:34.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want a shotgun to the dick!
It hurts so much!</font>

321
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God! Oh, God!</font>

322
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hang on. Trust me.</font>

323
00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:45.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

324
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

325
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:00.960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I know, right?
- How?</font>

326
00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He stole it.</font>

327
00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I stole time!
I stole the whole ski lodge!</font>

328
00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Check it out. Pure nitrotrinadium.</font>

329
00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:12.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou got it from the Russians. He told them
he's gonna build them a bomb.</font>

330
00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Classic Lou.</font>

331
00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. They've never seen
Back to the Future.</font>

332
00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:16.686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Everybody, get in.</font>

333
00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:18.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A little help here.</font>

334
00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Lou, you got to earn it.</font>

335
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam's trench coat?</font>

336
00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck is this? Is Adam here?</font>

337
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stay with me, Violator.</font>

338
00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:33.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's my hair?
It's where my power lies.</font>

339
00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck your fucking wig.</font>

340
00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta go back in time and stop
the killer before he shoots Lou.</font>

341
00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

342
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's how it works.</font>

343
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:45.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We get blackout drunk, we hallucinate,</font>

344
00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we wake up back in time.</font>

345
00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't mess with a winning formula, huh?</font>

346
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't be a fuckin' pussy!</font>

347
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I feel fucking great!
I think it worked.</font>

348
00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lou's not breathing.
- I think he's gone.</font>

349
00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.730
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick, Nick, Nick! Help, help, help!</font>

350
00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:17.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

351
00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lou, Lou.
- Lou. Lou!</font>

352
00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:24.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, fuck, fuck.</font>

353
00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:29.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess we were too late.</font>

354
00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:33.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Life is fucking weird, you know?</font>

355
00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:35.960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I spent so much time hating him.</font>

356
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now that he's gone,
I can't help but feel...</font>

357
00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Love.</font>

358
00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:42.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Not love. Don't be stupid.</font>

359
00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Respect?</font>

360
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:45.483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that's still way too strong a word.</font>

361
00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Admiration?</font>

362
00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, there's nothing
admirable about him.</font>

363
00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I mean, he's your dad.
Honor, maybe?</font>

364
00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not honor. I mean, that falls kind of
with respect and admiration.</font>

365
00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe just kind of a...
Just a general sense of...</font>

366
00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:57.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Missing, you miss him.</font>

367
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, I miss him.
- You miss him. Yeah, yeah.</font>

368
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I motherfucking miss him.</font>

369
00:20:00.360 --> 00:20:02.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What're you doing? You up in heaven?
Raping angels?</font>

370
00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Good for you, buddy.</font>

371
00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:12.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, God.
- What the fuck?</font>

372
00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:13.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw this on C.S.I.</font>

373
00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The bowels evacuate when the body dies.</font>

374
00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That smells like hatred.</font>

375
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is gonna get worse
before it gets better.</font>

376
00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dick! My dick!</font>

377
00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It worked! Holy shit! Wait, look!</font>

378
00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:29.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, look!</font>

379
00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good-looking dick to me!</font>

380
00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My dick is back!</font>

381
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How far back did we go?</font>

382
00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

383
00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We put a big dryer in
so we don't have to time travel naked.</font>

384
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is different.</font>

385
00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.284
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like a Scandinavian gay bar.</font>

386
00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like a Miami IKEA.</font>

387
00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:06.211
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, it looks amazing.</font>

388
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, look how classy it is.
It's like a museum.</font>

389
00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:19.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who...</font>

390
00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:20.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who is this?</font>

391
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's Jacob.</font>

392
00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why am I bald?</font>

393
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:27.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do?</font>

394
00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't... I didn't do that.</font>

395
00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like a pedophile dressed you.</font>

396
00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like a Jewish Jason Statham.</font>

397
00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:35.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like Michael Chiklis
fucked Big Daddy Warbucks,</font>

398
00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:37.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who fucked Lex Luthor.</font>

399
00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what it is.</font>

400
00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And who's the little doggie?</font>

401
00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he do...
What's he just doing there like this?</font>

402
00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:44.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why aren't you fucking that doggie?</font>

403
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would I be fucking the dog?</font>

404
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:47.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Power over nature.</font>

405
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, you.</font>

406
00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is that the coat-check girl?</font>

407
00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Boobs.</font>

408
00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how are you?</font>

409
00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.566
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't know you had company.</font>

410
00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:05.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah...
- Hey, Nick.</font>

411
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Sup?</font>

412
00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's he doing here?</font>

413
00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my house.</font>

414
00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think that'll hold you till later?</font>

415
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:15.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I'm sure.</font>

416
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.729
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Bye, Nick.
- Bye.</font>

417
00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- See you at the club?
- Right.</font>

418
00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That coat-check girl is rude.</font>

419
00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:26.406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like her.</font>

420
00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's pretty obvious
what's going on here, right.</font>

421
00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

422
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Alternate universe. Like Fringe.</font>

423
00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:34.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nerd</font>

424
00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a fucking nerd</font>

425
00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:38.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nerd</font>

426
00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a fucking nerd</font>

427
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nerd
- And no one likes you</font>

428
00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poindexter</font>

429
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:45.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one likes you</font>

430
00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:47.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Media preferences, Mr. Dorchen?</font>

431
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

432
00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:51.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Media preferences, Mr. Dorchen?</font>

433
00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Duck Dynasty?</font>

434
00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Media preferences, Mr. Dorchen?</font>

435
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.888
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Duck Fucking Dynasty!</font>

436
00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:01.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just try "the news."</font>

437
00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">News selected.
Thank you, Mr. Dorchen.</font>

438
00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tune in tomorrow
for the challenge round.</font>

439
00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat a boot? Eat your feelings.
Choozy Doozy.</font>

440
00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:11.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think I may be Mr. Dorchen.</font>

441
00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What? No.
- I think this is my house.</font>

442
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No way.
- I think he's right, Lou.</font>

443
00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's impossible.
- You heard it.</font>

444
00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:17.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just answered me.</font>

445
00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">March 26, 2025.</font>

446
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:22.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Comedy Central's World News
headquarters in New York.com,</font>

447
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.767
<font face="Comic Sans MS">this is The Daily Show
with Jessica Williams.</font>

448
00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:25.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">2025.</font>

449
00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:31.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Welcome to The Daily Show.
I'm Jessica Williams.</font>

450
00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tonight's guest, Dame Jennifer Lawrence</font>

451
00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">promoting her Meryl Streep
biopic, Streepin' It Real.</font>

452
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how do they get the people
to be on this show?</font>

453
00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:42.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, by now you've all seen
the NSA satellite footage</font>

454
00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">of the road rage incident</font>

455
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">between two self-driving
smart cars in New Detroit.</font>

456
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:52.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">President Neil Patrick Harris has called
for greater regulation of the industry,</font>

457
00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">while congressional Republicans defend
every sentient automobile's</font>

458
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">constitutional right
to shoot a black car</font>

459
00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">if it's actin' funny.</font>

460
00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:03.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This show's still got it.</font>

461
00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.
We went 10 years into the future.</font>

462
00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:12.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa.</font>

463
00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:15.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm distinguished.</font>

464
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should shave this, right?</font>

465
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:19.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, that's not a good look.</font>

466
00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is so smooth,
I don't think I went bald.</font>

467
00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:22.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think this is a choice,</font>

468
00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like Andre Agassi
or Bruce Willis or something.</font>

469
00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:27.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't look anything like
either of those two people.</font>

470
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">For one, they're fit and handsome
and you're neither of those things.</font>

471
00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like a turtle
crawled out of his shell.</font>

472
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you for making me bald.</font>

473
00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like
an orchestra conductor for stray cats.</font>

474
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like you give
lectures on public access.</font>

475
00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like a grown-up Gerber baby.</font>

476
00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:44.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like an egg
gave birth to another egg.</font>

477
00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:46.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like Gandalf the Poor.</font>

478
00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like
you advise Lando Calrissian.</font>

479
00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:50.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a good one.</font>

480
00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like the guy that owns the one
house that ruins the whole street.</font>

481
00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:54.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have I bombed anything, you think?</font>

482
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:57.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like
you've never made a correct decision.</font>

483
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ever.</font>

484
00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have definitely given
a back-alley blowjob.</font>

485
00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:02.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I gotta admit I kinda like this.</font>

486
00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I want to hit you
into the corner pocket.</font>

487
00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now I know why the coat-check
girl didn't like me.</font>

488
00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:09.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I look like fucking shit.</font>

489
00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So far so good on this future shit, huh?</font>

490
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:17.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. You know what?</font>

491
00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:20.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't feel like anything
bad's going to happen.</font>

492
00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:24.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, check it out. I found all
the gear from the painting.</font>

493
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:25.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Cool, huh?
- Whoa.</font>

494
00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happened
to the bottom of your suit?</font>

495
00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:31.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That pesky little doggie eat it?</font>

496
00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:33.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's called fashion, Lou.</font>

497
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You look like...</font>

498
00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:36.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Nope, not doing anymore "You look like."
- But you look like...</font>

499
00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:37.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't give a shit.
We did it on the stairs.</font>

500
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:40.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We did it in front of the mirror.
It'd be tacky to do it a third time.</font>

501
00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, do you guys
want some fresh clothes?</font>

502
00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:43.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a whole closet full of stuff.</font>

503
00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love this shirt. My shit is fly.</font>

504
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:48.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Weren't you listening
to my speech, dude?</font>

505
00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Always pack a bag.</font>

506
00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, is that...</font>

507
00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No. It is not.
- How did you get that?</font>

508
00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I didn't get...
- I know what it...</font>

509
00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:58.526
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw what it said.</font>

510
00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It doesn't say anything!</font>

511
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that the Cincinnati box?</font>

512
00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't say that out loud.
- It might hear you.</font>

513
00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're really never
going to tell me what's inside that box?</font>

514
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, we'll tell you. We'll tell him.</font>

515
00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm going to tell him.
- Lou.</font>

516
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the Declaration of Independence
with a map on the back.</font>

517
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Our family's chosen.
- Yep.</font>

518
00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's just the plot of that
movie National Treasure.</font>

519
00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:20.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the Ark of the Covenant.</font>

520
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's Raiders of the Lost Ark.
You're not even tryin'.</font>

521
00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, that's not even
anything that could be in the box.</font>

522
00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, this has gone on long enough.</font>

523
00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:27.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

524
00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a ring that turns you invisible
and carries with it the power of evil.</font>

525
00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:34.326
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen fucking movies,
you guys! I've seen movies!</font>

526
00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, why are you alive?</font>

527
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

528
00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you alive? We're in the future.</font>

529
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:41.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you know what? He's right.</font>

530
00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:43.003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause if we went back in time,
you'd be alive.</font>

531
00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But we went 10 years
in the fuckin' future.</font>

532
00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You should be dead.</font>

533
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, what the fuck?</font>

534
00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you should be
asking yourselves is,</font>

535
00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"When the fuck?"</font>

536
00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God damn it!</font>

537
00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:54.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This fucking guy again!</font>

538
00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why do you do that?</font>

539
00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's not going to tell us anything.</font>

540
00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, why don't you make like a fuck off
and get out of here?</font>

541
00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. So all we have to do is go back
and Lou's gonna be okay, right?</font>

542
00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:07.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not that simple, really.</font>

543
00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.368
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The hot tub doesn't take you
where you want to go.</font>

544
00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It takes you where you need to go.</font>

545
00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:11.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

546
00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There are
certain calculations and innovations</font>

547
00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and salutations
that haven't even come to pass yet.</font>

548
00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the hell does that mean?</font>

549
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What it means is, at the present,
your tub here is just a tub.</font>

550
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:27.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, are you saying
that time travel is not even possible?</font>

551
00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:30.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right on, Liz.
Give the pretty lady a flower.</font>

552
00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Damn it.
- Lizzie.</font>

553
00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:33.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's bullshit, okay?</font>

554
00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a whole vault
of nitro right here.</font>

555
00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.168
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where'd it go? Where did it go?</font>

556
00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:41.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What did you do with my nitro?</font>

557
00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:44.885
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How can I take what doesn't exist yet?</font>

558
00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:47.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It exists in the past.
How can it not exist in the future?</font>

559
00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:50.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The past, the future. All very cute.</font>

560
00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:52.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But who's to say the past
isn't anything more</font>

561
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">than the future of this present?</font>

562
00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:56.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, nitro is from the future?</font>

563
00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Terminator.</font>

564
00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:00.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.</font>

565
00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:03.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think everything is like Terminator.</font>

566
00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:04.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause everything is like Terminator!</font>

567
00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:07.008
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Arnold's hand gets
chopped off in the past,</font>

568
00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:10.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">somebody finds it, reverse
engineers that shit. Boom!</font>

569
00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Terminators running all
around this motherfucker.</font>

570
00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's how we got nitro?</font>

571
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I never saw Terminator.</font>

572
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.048
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck this guy and his riddles!</font>

573
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thanks for holding him down for me!</font>

574
00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:29.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hold him down"?</font>

575
00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:31.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you can beat to death
the mystical time baron</font>

576
00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that holds the keys
to our very existence?</font>

577
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's your fucking plan here?</font>

578
00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:36.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up.</font>

579
00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Tighten your shit up, Lou.
We needed him.</font>

580
00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:39.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Amateur hour.</font>

581
00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This thing is awesome.</font>

582
00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:42.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I probably invented it.</font>

583
00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Lou Sux</font>

584
00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Cox N Dix." Flip it.</font>

585
00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

586
00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:52.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Try to stay with me.</font>

587
00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is going to get complicated.</font>

588
00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.608
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is time.</font>

589
00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And you're dead.</font>

590
00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So Lou is killed in our present,</font>

591
00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which means that here,
in the future, he should still be dead.</font>

592
00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, clearly, he's not fuckin' dead,</font>

593
00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:07.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'cause he's sittin' here,
still bothering me.</font>

594
00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So what that tells me is</font>

595
00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're in a completely different future
on a completely different timeline.</font>

596
00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob, I'm the Sarlacc.</font>

597
00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

598
00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anyway, the Repairman said</font>

599
00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:24.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that the past is actually the future
of the present we're in right now.</font>

600
00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:29.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I think what that means is
the killer is from the future.</font>

601
00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:33.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So clearly, someone from 2025
will go back in time and shoot Lou.</font>

602
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like Looper.</font>

603
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow!</font>

604
00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about a fucking spoiler alert?</font>

605
00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:40.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Hey, Lou, you want to go see Looper?"</font>

606
00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Nah, I got a thing I gotta do."</font>

607
00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in my queue! That counts.</font>

608
00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.369
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the first Bruce Willis
movie we missed.</font>

609
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is Bruce in that?
- Okay.</font>

610
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Plainly, just by virtue of
Lou being here alive in 2025</font>

611
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:54.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when we know that he died in 2015,</font>

612
00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we're here to stop his future murder.</font>

613
00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Which happens in the past.
- Exactly.</font>

614
00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I get this shit.</font>

615
00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm bored by this shit.</font>

616
00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go check out the future
strip club situation.</font>

617
00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:05.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">High five.</font>

618
00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:07.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you just say "high five"
instead of high-fiving?</font>

619
00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:08.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- High five.
- High five.</font>

620
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:10.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the laziest thing
I've ever heard.</font>

621
00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:11.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">High five.</font>

622
00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:13.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't have the energy for this?</font>

623
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no.
You guys, we can't just fuck around.</font>

624
00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got to find your murderer.</font>

625
00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we don't have to do any of that</font>

626
00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we go check out a strip club.</font>

627
00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You flickered.
- You're flickering.</font>

628
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I flickered... Why am I flickering?</font>

629
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:28.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">By threatening your own existence.</font>

630
00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you listened to
anything I've been saying?</font>

631
00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:32.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have not listened to any of it.</font>

632
00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God, okay, fine! Fine.</font>

633
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll solve my stupid murder,
which hasn't happened yet.</font>

634
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:43.003
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or we can just go to a strip club.</font>

635
00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, fine!
The fucking murder thing.</font>

636
00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing's really changed.</font>

637
00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You'd figure after 10 years,
something would be different, right?</font>

638
00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:27.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's some sexy-ass
future shit right there.</font>

639
00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:30.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you or someone you love
have a problem with</font>

640
00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- heroin, speed, ice...
- Yes. Yeah.</font>

641
00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...smack, whack, jack...
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.</font>

642
00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:37.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...Al Michaels' Revenge or cocaine?</font>

643
00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:38.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">First order of business,</font>

644
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">we get ourselves some
Al Michaels' Revenge, right?</font>

645
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We can help put the "U"
back in "Reuvenate."</font>

646
00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're still demonizing addiction?
Like it's some kind of sickness.</font>

647
00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot wait for you
to hit rock bottom.</font>

648
00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah! Yeah.</font>

649
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who in the future
would want to kill you, Lou?</font>

650
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:54.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

651
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The only person who's ever
had any motivation</font>

652
00:31:56.760 --> 00:31:58.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to kill me has been me.</font>

653
00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.120
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I treat everyone with the
utmost respect and kindness.</font>

654
00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:03.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou, you tried to push me
down the stairs last week.</font>

655
00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a joke!</font>

656
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:09.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, it's you.</font>

657
00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob is the murderer.</font>

658
00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not the murderer. Come on.</font>

659
00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:17.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Because you seem to have
stepped right into my life.</font>

660
00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You always wanted to be
the one fucking that tiger!</font>

661
00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:23.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou, if I was going to fuckin' kill you,
I wouldn't use a gun, okay?</font>

662
00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:27.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I would spike your mid-morning cocktail
with a tasteless, but potent sedative.</font>

663
00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, while you slept,
I would wait the 9 hours</font>

664
00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:32.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for it to fully flush out of your system,
so there's no trace.</font>

665
00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:37.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I would take you out into the Gulf
and feed you to a tiger shark.</font>

666
00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.685
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Damn, that's cold.</font>

667
00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:40.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I wouldn't use a gun.</font>

668
00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be making my own mid-morning
cocktail from now on, thank you.</font>

669
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I wish Adam was here.
He'd know what to do.</font>

670
00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just described my whole entire life.</font>

671
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need Adam and he's not here.</font>

672
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where the hell is he?</font>

673
00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

674
00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:59.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When we were carrying you
after you got shot,</font>

675
00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I saw his trench coat</font>

676
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">beside the hot tub time machine.</font>

677
00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam murdered me.</font>

678
00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so Adam shoots Lou,</font>

679
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and then uses the hot tub
to escape somewhere in time</font>

680
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:13.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Textbook.</font>

681
00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Only in our fucked-up social circle
is that textbook.</font>

682
00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why would Adam wanna shoot you?</font>

683
00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I've only been
the best of friends to him.</font>

684
00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You tried to fuck his wife.
- You tried to fuck his wife?</font>

685
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a joke! Come on, you guys get that.</font>

686
00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

687
00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:28.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You get it.</font>

688
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">In Lougle financial news,
no surprise here,</font>

689
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lougle finished trading up
10 points today.</font>

690
00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice. Looks like
I turned the company around.</font>

691
00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll turn you around.</font>

692
00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:42.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Somebody's grumpy
'cause they got murdered.</font>

693
00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:46.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam! Come on out!</font>

694
00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's your best friends
in the whole fucking world!</font>

695
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:49.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure this is the right place?</font>

696
00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lougle Search brought up
Adam's location and DNA.</font>

697
00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's really got to fix
his privacy settings.</font>

698
00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:57.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If he's here,
I'm gonna kill him before he kills me.</font>

699
00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:58.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. Can I help you?</font>

700
00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:03.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God.
Jacob Dorchen and Nick Webber?</font>

701
00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:05.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guilty.</font>

702
00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Am I on Celebrity Subpoena?</font>

703
00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just tell me. Tell me,
am I on Celebrity Subpoena?</font>

704
00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:13.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And hello, sir. Who are you?</font>

705
00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:15.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fuck it, wrong house.
- Stop.</font>

706
00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:16.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does Adam Yates live here?</font>

707
00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:19.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Adam Yates Stedmeyer.</font>

708
00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:24.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so you're married to my aunt,
which makes you my uncle.</font>

709
00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:28.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But that means that
you and I are first cousins.</font>

710
00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God, you guys. This is aws.</font>

711
00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He looks like a preppie Braveheart.</font>

712
00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I found this photo after my mother died.</font>

713
00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great White Buffalo.</font>

714
00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Great White Buffalo.
- Great White Buffalo.</font>

715
00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:47.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Great White Buffalo. Yeah.</font>

716
00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:48.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>

717
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:51.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So this is him, right? This is my dad?</font>

718
00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:53.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you never met him?</font>

719
00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, they broke up
before I was even born.</font>

720
00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:58.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But you guys can introduce us.</font>

721
00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. See, the thing about that is,
it's complicated.</font>

722
00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you guys ever feel like</font>

723
00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">everything happens for a reason?</font>

724
00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yes.
- No.</font>

725
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Call it destiny, or predestiny.</font>

726
00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it's "predestination."</font>

727
00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:14.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it's predestiny. I read a book.</font>

728
00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:15.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was that book a dictionary?</font>

729
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:17.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was a book called Predestiny.</font>

730
00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I don't really give a shit.</font>

731
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">With predestiny, it dictates</font>

732
00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that there is a force or something
holding the strings</font>

733
00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:25.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and setting everything up</font>

734
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">just so they can be
knocked down perfectly</font>

735
00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">into...</font>

736
00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:36.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Place.</font>

737
00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:39.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't! I can't do it!
I gotta go. Let's go.</font>

738
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:41.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Sorry.
- Sorry, bro, we gotta go.</font>

739
00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:42.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nice skirt, by the way.</font>

740
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Thank you.
- I have the dress.</font>

741
00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, who said anything about a dress?</font>

742
00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:49.160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I certainly didn't say
anything about the dress.</font>

743
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:52.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I didn't realize
that Adam had guests.</font>

744
00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, babe.
- Hi.</font>

745
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:57.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, meet Jill. Jill, meet the guys.</font>

746
00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're getting married this weekend.</font>

747
00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:01.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me and Jill, not me and you guys.</font>

748
00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop it. You're gonna make milk
come out of my nose.</font>

749
00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:06.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Milk? What milk?
- I had milk earlier.</font>

750
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you Nick Webber?</font>

751
00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes. Yes, I am.</font>

752
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:13.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you please do the Webber Strut?</font>

753
00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:15.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Webber...</font>

754
00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, you know it.
He wants us to do it.</font>

755
00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:18.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think so.</font>

756
00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:21.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody, strut, strut, strut, strut.</font>

757
00:36:21.600 --> 00:36:23.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Stop that.
- Strut, strut, strut...</font>

758
00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow, they're really good at your dance.</font>

759
00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:29.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Your poor man's Macarena
that you are very famous for.</font>

760
00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:30.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody do the...</font>

761
00:36:30.880 --> 00:36:32.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">They're, like,
picking dicks out of a tree.</font>

762
00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It looks like dick-picking.</font>

763
00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And for the record,
I still like your music.</font>

764
00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:39.208
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
I know you've fallen on hard times.</font>

765
00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:40.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hard times?</font>

766
00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're so poor now,
but I really like you still.</font>

767
00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:43.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean, poor?</font>

768
00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:45.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God, that's the one.
- That's the one?</font>

769
00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:46.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That is the one.</font>

770
00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, we found our mini-cake bites.</font>

771
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:50.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys!</font>

772
00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We found our mini-cake bites.</font>

773
00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:53.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

774
00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:54.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I didn't tell you.</font>

775
00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jacob is my cousin.
- No.</font>

776
00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- And Uncle Lou...
- Don't you ever call me that.</font>

777
00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- ...Is my uncle.
- What?</font>

778
00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:04.483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And they came here in a... What was it?</font>

779
00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hot tub time machine.</font>

780
00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's right.</font>

781
00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

782
00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So I guess you came here
in a hot tub time machine, too.</font>

783
00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen.</font>

784
00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:19.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- They're looking for my dad.
- What?</font>

785
00:37:20.040 --> 00:37:21.451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have to go with them.</font>

786
00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:24.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you guys mind?
It would be really, really great</font>

787
00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to have my father at the wedding.</font>

788
00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck that. Fuck that.</font>

789
00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No way in hell. No way in hell.</font>

790
00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:30.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta let Adam go.</font>

791
00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, this is exactly the
sort of thing that he needs.</font>

792
00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:35.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We've been together for 10 years.
He hardly ever goes out.</font>

793
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:37.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He didn't even have a bachelor party.</font>

794
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, you're making me
seem a little stiff.</font>

795
00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:39.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right.</font>

796
00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Well, you have fun
and make good choices.</font>

797
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You're my best choice.
- You're my best choice.</font>

798
00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:47.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, you're my best choice.
- You're my bestest choice.</font>

799
00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, you're my best choice!</font>

800
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're my best choice!</font>

801
00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're. My. Best. Choice.</font>

802
00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- The fuck?
- Yeah, seriously.</font>

803
00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, I'll be there in one second.</font>

804
00:37:57.320 --> 00:38:00.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're. My. Best. Choice.</font>

805
00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:03.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you guys
are my dad's full-on bros, huh?</font>

806
00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:05.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I always wondered
what my dad's full-on bros</font>

807
00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:08.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">would be like and now...
Now I totally know.</font>

808
00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause we're getting
some serious hang-time.</font>

809
00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

810
00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:16.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, I feel like we are
going to have an unforgettably...</font>

811
00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, where the fuck are we going?</font>

812
00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, my mom used to live near here,</font>

813
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I figured we'd go by her old building
and see if we can find a clue.</font>

814
00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Well, there's a 50-50 chance
I might murder your dad,</font>

815
00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so if you have a reunion speech,
keep it tight.</font>

816
00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:31.289
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit!</font>

817
00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:32.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wassup, man?</font>

818
00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no, no.</font>

819
00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's no one driving that car.</font>

820
00:38:42.280 --> 00:38:43.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, it's a smart car.</font>

821
00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:46.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, I can see that.
- No, it's a smart car.</font>

822
00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:48.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's self-driving.
- What?</font>

823
00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's awesome!</font>

824
00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, see, this is
that future shit I'm talking about.</font>

825
00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:52.880
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How much that set you back?</font>

826
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:55.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys are hilarious.</font>

827
00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't own it. I mean, no one does.</font>

828
00:38:57.560 --> 00:38:58.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You need a car, one shows up.</font>

829
00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really?</font>

830
00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a wonderful car
and I appreciate you.</font>

831
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:04.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

832
00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, this car runs on feelings.</font>

833
00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:09.528
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I guess a 6-year-old
would say that.</font>

834
00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Burn.</font>

835
00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really? Would a 6-year-old say that?</font>

836
00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the fuck was that?
- Revved up on you.</font>

837
00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:19.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Did he just rev up on me?
- He sure did.</font>

838
00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! What's up?
You got a problem with me?</font>

839
00:39:22.680 --> 00:39:25.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? I'll give you
the first punch, huh?</font>

840
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead.</font>

841
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Go ahead! Hit me!</font>

842
00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

843
00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:31.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not a good car!</font>

844
00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:35.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not smart! You're just a car!</font>

845
00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:38.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I don't think
it actually works that way.</font>

846
00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:40.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, you can't hurt its feelings.</font>

847
00:39:40.520 --> 00:39:41.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a wonderful car
and I appreciate you.</font>

848
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, guess what?</font>

849
00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can hurt my feelings, okay?</font>

850
00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.770
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What?
- I'm walking.</font>

851
00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:52.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is he always like this?
- Pretty much.</font>

852
00:39:52.200 --> 00:39:54.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does he have, like, emotional problems?</font>

853
00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:56.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's got a real serious drug problem.
- He got shot last night.</font>

854
00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:58.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's got that runt ball.
- His son hates him.</font>

855
00:39:58.920 --> 00:40:00.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's fair to say, right?</font>

856
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:02.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah. He's a monster.</font>

857
00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd like to help him.</font>

858
00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm sure you're sick of this,</font>

859
00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:18.007
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but will you sign my Dick Pad?</font>

860
00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:20.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You put your dick in there!</font>

861
00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a genius invention.</font>

862
00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, okay? I know.</font>

863
00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:26.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You put your whole mouth
inside your son's jerk-off machine.</font>

864
00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does your son's penis taste like?</font>

865
00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:30.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Goddamn you.</font>

866
00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:32.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it delicious?</font>

867
00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, a friend of mine's some
sort a big shot over at Lougle.</font>

868
00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:37.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad Syed? He's coming to my wedding.</font>

869
00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Brad?
- Hey.</font>

870
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys should absolutely
come to my wedding.</font>

871
00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No.</font>

872
00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:45.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Man, I wish we could, but we're doing...</font>

873
00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:47.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker!</font>

874
00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.764
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gary Winkle.</font>

875
00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:03.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck him in the face.
Right in the fucking face.</font>

876
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.969
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not about money,
it's about making money.</font>

877
00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look who it...</font>

878
00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How are you rich, huh?
How the fuck are you rich?</font>

879
00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:12.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lou...
- You killed me!</font>

880
00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to kill you
before you can kill me again!</font>

881
00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa...</font>

882
00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's hilarious.
Why would I kill you? I love you, man.</font>

883
00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

884
00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, okay. All right. I'm fine.</font>

885
00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:26.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You not buying that land</font>

886
00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</font>

887
00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:32.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because when Hurricane Beth came through
and destroyed half the waterfront...</font>

888
00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It turned this worthless piece of dirt
into a goldmine.</font>

889
00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:37.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

890
00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:39.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you didn't murder me?</font>

891
00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?
I love you, man.</font>

892
00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, are you boys coming up or what?</font>

893
00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's not a party unless
it's a Gary Winkle party.</font>

894
00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">At Gary Winkle's.</font>

895
00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:51.926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Wink.</font>

896
00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing?
- It's a double wink.</font>

897
00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically, that's more of a blink.</font>

898
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.444
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's a blink.
- You can't wink, can you?</font>

899
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Of course I can wink.</font>

900
00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Prove it.</font>

901
00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

902
00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me do this. Hold on.</font>

903
00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:07.482
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me hold this open.
I'll hold this open.</font>

904
00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now do it.</font>

905
00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">See?</font>

906
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we go to the fuckin' party now?</font>

907
00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.525
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Welcome to The Wink!</font>

908
00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:27.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, jugglers, give my boys
anything they want...</font>

909
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From that shelf down.</font>

910
00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:32.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lou, what are we doing here?
- You know.</font>

911
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Winkle is not the killer. We gotta go.</font>

912
00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:35.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't care,
'cause there's cocaine right there.</font>

913
00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:37.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Didn't you see the cocaine?
Look, look, look.</font>

914
00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:38.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I see the cocaine. So what?</font>

915
00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:40.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I'm going to do that.
So, first... And then...</font>

916
00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:43.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I'm not flickering. Am I flickering?
You cannot say that I'm flickering.</font>

917
00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're on a mission to save your life.</font>

918
00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:46.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think I don't want
to roll my dick around some cocaine,</font>

919
00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- and get titty-slapped?
- Okay.</font>

920
00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:50.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Pop some bottles?
Do some crazy future shit?</font>

921
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:51.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm trying to keep you from flickering.</font>

922
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:52.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What the fuck are you doing?
- Good talk.</font>

923
00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:55.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. And popping bottles,
that's old school.</font>

924
00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You bringing that back?</font>

925
00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

926
00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like that. I like you.</font>

927
00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:03.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are these? I don't care.</font>

928
00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So, Nick, listen, I was so sorry
to hear about you and Courtney.</font>

929
00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

930
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:12.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Gotcha. Forget I even brought it up.</font>

931
00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:14.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, really, what do you mean?</font>

932
00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you loud and clear, man.</font>

933
00:43:16.920 --> 00:43:18.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think you hear me at all.</font>

934
00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:19.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Sophie!</font>

935
00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:21.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There you are.</font>

936
00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:27.210
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have a surprise for you.</font>

937
00:43:28.760 --> 00:43:31.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sophie has a surprise for me.</font>

938
00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:32.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye, dude!</font>

939
00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:36.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take a room-temperature
almond milk, please.</font>

940
00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:40.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, actually,
I'll get a tangerine margarita.</font>

941
00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:41.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Scratch that.</font>

942
00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:45.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take just an apricot
sliced into fours. And a kiwi.</font>

943
00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:48.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you have kiwi?
I'll take a kiwi, sliced up.</font>

944
00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:50.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A banana thrown in there.</font>

945
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:51.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? Dealer's choice.</font>

946
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:53.080
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just a fruit salad.</font>

947
00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Should we go somewhere more private?</font>

948
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.488
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob Dorchen wants privacy.</font>

949
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's so 2018.</font>

950
00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, right.</font>

951
00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Get that out of here.</font>

952
00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean,
I wouldn't mind a little something.</font>

953
00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember, we agreed?</font>

954
00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:14.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at your dad.</font>

955
00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:17.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're not going down
that road anymore.</font>

956
00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:23.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God, I'm so good at that!</font>

957
00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes!</font>

958
00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Satan.</font>

959
00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:28.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like, I'll finger your dog,
I don't care.</font>

960
00:44:28.360 --> 00:44:30.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a joke! As a joke!</font>

961
00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have some advice for you.</font>

962
00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:33.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't want to be
considered a sex offender,</font>

963
00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">don't take a shit in a sandbox</font>

964
00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that happens to be in a playground.</font>

965
00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:40.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay? Don't do it. 'Cause guess what?</font>

966
00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have two things, a record
and a fucking nickname.</font>

967
00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:46.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know it's a potentially risky move...
Wedding sorbet!</font>

968
00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:49.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As a palate cleanser, of course.
I mean, I'm not insane.</font>

969
00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.928
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God! Fuckin' A!
You're Nick Webber, man!</font>

970
00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's take a picture!
I can't believe it's you, man.</font>

971
00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:55.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna send this to everyone.</font>

972
00:44:55.520 --> 00:44:57.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm gonna get, like, a billion views!
- Okay.</font>

973
00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I remember when I first heard
that stupid song. I was like,</font>

974
00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Man, that song is so dumb."</font>

975
00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:04.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do the Strut.</font>

976
00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:05.720
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Do the Strut.
- No, I'm good.</font>

977
00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:06.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You won't do the fucking song?</font>

978
00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- You want to see the Strut?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...</font>

979
00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, yo! Check this out!</font>

980
00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:13.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick Webber's in the house,
so get ready for the original</font>

981
00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Webber Strut!</font>

982
00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Before that, let's back it up.</font>

983
00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:24.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">6 years ago, see where it all began.</font>

984
00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:27.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I made a lot of mistakes.
I've taken advantage.</font>

985
00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.240
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And now I'm ready to be original.</font>

986
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:33.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is dedicated to
those who never got to be,</font>

987
00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:34.451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">because of me.</font>

988
00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Strut to the time of the clock</font>

989
00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's midnight
Everybody strut right now</font>

<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know, but you will</font>

994
00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:54.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody do the
Strut, strut, strut</font>

995
00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody do the

<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everybody do the</font>

997
00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:13.521

than the other room.</font>

998
00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What?</font>

999
00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:22.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1000
00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.887
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at him go. Chip off the old block.</font>

1001
00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, be nice.</font>

1002
00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:32.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be nice. Be nice. Be nice.
Be nice. Be nice. Be nice.</font>

1003
00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:34.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Son!</font>

1004
00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:37.923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! What a coincidence!</font>

1005
00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wondering where you ran off to,
but here you are.</font>

1006
00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who let you in here?</font>

1007
00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you go find your murderer?</font>

1008
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:48.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Think your old man can get in
on a little of this action? Or...</font>

1009
00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:49.724
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a private party.</font>

1010
00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:51.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one's mine.</font>

1011
00:46:51.800 --> 00:46:53.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What? Yes! See?</font>

1012
00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:54.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still got it!</font>

1013
00:46:54.880 --> 00:46:56.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are the house rules here?</font>

1014
00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:57.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to know what to do.</font>

1015
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to break any rules,
get chucked out right away, you know?</font>

1016
00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:04.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That'd be fucked up.
- Touch me, you filthy vagrant.</font>

1017
00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, what was that?</font>

1018
00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:12.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nothing. It wasn't anything.</font>

1019
00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just flickered.</font>

1020
00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, I'd flickered? No, I didn't.</font>

1021
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:15.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you do that?</font>

1022
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's threatening his own existence.</font>

1023
00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:20.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou, you can't be here,
'cause you're jeopardizing your future.</font>

1024
00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Would you mind
your own fucking beeswax?</font>

1025
00:47:22.760 --> 00:47:24.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whatever. I'm over this.</font>

1026
00:47:24.440 --> 00:47:26.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! No!</font>

1027
00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:28.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no!</font>

1028
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:34.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Long story short, the caterer
did talk us into the Chateaubriand,</font>

1029
00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:37.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">which, you know,
I'll admit, is a sexy side of beef.</font>

1030
00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sounds like it.</font>

1031
00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I think you know
where I'm going with this.</font>

1032
00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You thought wrong.</font>

1033
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:44.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horseradish station. That's right. We're
gonna have the white and the reds,</font>

1034
00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:46.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">separate service, different intensity.</font>

1035
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be great...</font>

1036
00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:52.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait a second. Nick?
You should play our wedding.</font>

1037
00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:54.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People would love to see the Strut
in person.</font>

1038
00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:56.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sure they would.</font>

1039
00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:57.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, what do you guys
want from the party tray?</font>

1040
00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me?</font>

1041
00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.
I'm getting married tomorrow,</font>

1042
00:48:01.720 --> 00:48:03.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so I'm really trying to take it easy.</font>

1043
00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, you're getting married
for the rest of your life,</font>

1044
00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:07.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so why have any fun tonight at all?</font>

1045
00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1046
00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Uncle Lou is right.
- Don't call me that.</font>

1047
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:14.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the craziest thing you got.</font>

1048
00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:16.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Someone sounds like he wants
the Electric Ladybug.</font>

1049
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The Electric...</font>

1050
00:48:18.280 --> 00:48:19.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick it right there.</font>

1051
00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What... I'm sorry, what exactly is that?</font>

1052
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't take it off for 24 hours.</font>

1053
00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why can't I take it off for 24 hours?</font>

1054
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:32.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. What's so funny?</font>

1055
00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Relax. Relax.
It's just like baby aspirin.</font>

1056
00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.243
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Except more of a super-high
intensity psychotropic drug trip.</font>

1057
00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I promise you,</font>

1058
00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">you're not gonna like this.</font>

1059
00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bye-bye.</font>

1060
00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Horseradish.</font>

1061
00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:16.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello.</font>

1062
00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:18.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a god!</font>

1063
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:21.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a fucking god!</font>

1064
00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:20.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1065
00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:24.249
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not in the dumpster.
I owe you 50 bucks.</font>

1066
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:26.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, lick my pussy.</font>

1067
00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just kidding, guys.
I'm up here. What's up?</font>

1068
00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:34.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What are you doing up there?
- Why are you down there, stupid fuck?</font>

1069
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys, last night,</font>

1070
00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:38.125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">my eyes</font>

1071
00:50:39.280 --> 00:50:41.044
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- opened.
- Okay.</font>

1072
00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:43.209
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm telling you, you guys,
you got to get up here.</font>

1073
00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:45.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, the way the sun
is just dancing off these leaves...</font>

1074
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Mr. Webber.</font>

1075
00:50:47.160 --> 00:50:48.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hi. I'm from Choozy Doozy.</font>

1076
00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm here to take you to the show.
- Show?</font>

1077
00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah.</font>

1078
00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:53.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How about that?</font>

1079
00:50:53.960 --> 00:50:57.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick Webber has a show in 2025.
Still got it!</font>

1080
00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, but, I mean, we can't go
because we have to solve his murder.</font>

1081
00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:03.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! Look. Hey, not flickering.</font>

1082
00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:05.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Maybe it's a lead. It's a fun lead.</font>

1083
00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:07.529
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Until somebody goes back in time
and kills you.</font>

1084
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't miss my gig.</font>

1085
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:12.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, Choozy Doozy is my favorite show.</font>

1086
00:51:12.240 --> 00:51:13.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, how did you find us?</font>

1087
00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just go where the cars take me.</font>

1088
00:51:15.160 --> 00:51:16.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I'm coming down.</font>

1089
00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think I can make
that dumpster, guys?</font>

1090
00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:19.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No.
- No.</font>

1091
00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:22.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah, I think I can probably make it.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes! Come on!</font>

1092
00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I think so, too, Lou. Thanks.</font>

1093
00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:25.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Adam, stay right there.
- Stop. Adam!</font>

1094
00:51:25.440 --> 00:51:26.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on!
- Baby Adam!</font>

1095
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:27.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can!</font>

1096
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop, Lou!</font>

1097
00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here I go. I'm gonna jump.</font>

1098
00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy fuck...</font>

1099
00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Got you!</font>

1100
00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was fucking awesome!</font>

1101
00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.848
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oh, my God!
- How did you even do that?</font>

1102
00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:42.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm strong as fuck.</font>

1103
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:47.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get ready for mischief, mayhem,
plenty of truths and more than one dare!</font>

1104
00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is Celebrity Choozy Doozy!</font>

We got a very, very exciting</font>

1109
00:52:06.920 --> 00:52:08.524

1110
00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:12.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please help me welcome back
to the stage, musical sensation,</font>

1111
00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:15.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nick Webber!</font>

1112
00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:24.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hello?</font>

1113
00:52:24.240 --> 00:52:28.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, honey,
guess where I am. Just guess.</font>

1114
00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, shut up. I'm at Choozy Doozy.</font>

1115
00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where have you been?</font>

1116
00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:33.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I tried to call you, like,
a hundred times.</font>

1117
00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:36.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was with that crazy phone call
last night?</font>

1118
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Crazy call? What do you mean?</font>

1119
00:52:38.640 --> 00:52:42.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't remember calling me
and telling me that you were a god?</font>

1120
00:52:42.560 --> 00:52:44.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Does that sound like me?</font>

1121
00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:47.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, I had the most amazing night.</font>

1122
00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:49.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did everything.</font>

1123
00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:52.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I punched a man in the face.</font>

1124
00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just walked up to him.</font>

1125
00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:56.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just punched him with my fist.</font>

1126
00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I felt like an ape. Like an ape.</font>

1127
00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:03.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did Eskimo kisses
with this beautiful woman.</font>

1128
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

1129
00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, have you ever felt</font>

1130
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:11.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that everything that you've experienced
and said up to this point is just a fraud?</font>

1131
00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:12.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Excuse me?</font>

1132
00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:14.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. Okay, "fraud" is too strong a word.</font>

1133
00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.968
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's more like a lie.</font>

1134
00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Lie" is actually...
It's not right, either.</font>

1135
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's kind of a hard concept to...</font>

1136
00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, bye, honey.</font>

1137
00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:29.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, that went well.
That went really well.</font>

1138
00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:33.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our studio audience
will have the opportunity</font>

1139
00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:36.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to challenge you to specific tasks.</font>

1140
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:39.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The best idea shall prevail.</font>

1141
00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:41.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because this is...</font>

1142
00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:44.769
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Celebrity Choozy Doozy!</font>

1143
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:46.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that, exactly?</font>

1144
00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me hear some ideas
from the audience.</font>

1145
00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:51.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on! We want some new ideas!
- Eat a bunch of waffles!</font>

1146
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:53.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eat a bunch of waffles.
Very, very nice choice.</font>

1147
00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Juggle knives!</font>

1148
00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:55.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Very scary!</font>

1149
00:53:56.080 --> 00:53:57.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He could lose an arm!
That happened last week.</font>

1150
00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Swallow a watch!</font>

1151
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:01.445
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can you swallow a watch, Nick?</font>

1152
00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:02.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hope not.</font>

1153
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck a dude!</font>

1154
00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:05.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa!</font>

1155
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay!</font>

1156
00:54:08.640 --> 00:54:11.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Say some more stuff!
Say something else!</font>

1157
00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:13.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, remember, folks,</font>

1158
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when you see something you like,
you make your selection,</font>

1159
00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:18.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and it'll show up here on the board.</font>

1160
00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:20.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to fuck a dude.</font>

1161
00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:22.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're adorable.</font>

1162
00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:26.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the best day of my life.</font>

1163
00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:28.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck's wrong with everybody?</font>

1164
00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Waffles, waffles.
It's a neck-and-neck with...</font>

1165
00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:35.365
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1166
00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:38.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that.</font>

1167
00:54:38.480 --> 00:54:39.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, hell, no!</font>

1168
00:54:39.720 --> 00:54:42.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just got very lucky, my friend,
because you were almost</font>

1169
00:54:42.920 --> 00:54:45.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">about to have to eat
a whole bunch of waffles!</font>

1170
00:54:45.200 --> 00:54:47.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm willing to do that. I'm willing...
I'll eat the waffles.</font>

1171
00:54:47.440 --> 00:54:48.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, now...</font>

1172
00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:53.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who had the idea of this man
fornicating with a gentleman?</font>

1173
00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:55.203
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Over here! This guy!</font>

1174
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's your name, sir?</font>

1175
00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou Dorchen.</font>

1176
00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, Lou, as you know,
with Choozy Doozy...</font>

1177
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:04.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You choose it, you dooze it!</font>

1178
00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:06.722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You choose it, you dooze it.</font>

1179
00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:13.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. I dooze what now?</font>

1180
00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

1181
00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Come on up here, Lou!
- This is crazy!</font>

1182
00:55:17.160 --> 00:55:19.083
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop smiling!</font>

1183
00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:25.127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, we're back with the Celebrity
Choozy Doozy challenge round.</font>

1184
00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:28.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We have Nick Webber along
with his pal, Lou Dorchen!</font>

1185
00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:31.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What exactly is this?</font>

1186
00:55:31.120 --> 00:55:33.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the number one show on TV.</font>

1187
00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, load 'em up!</font>

1188
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:42.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck?</font>

1189
00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.771
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't think this is real.</font>

1190
00:55:46.720 --> 00:55:48.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. It's like Lawnmower Man.</font>

1191
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.</font>

1192
00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:52.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like Lawnmower Man,</font>

1193
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:53.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">except, you know,
we're supposed to fuck.</font>

1194
00:55:53.680 --> 00:55:56.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, well, that's not going to happen.</font>

1195
00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:58.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bring me the thing!</font>

1196
00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well...</font>

1197
00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:02.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm glad we're on the same page.</font>

1198
00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on? Lou!</font>

1199
00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:16.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Motherfucker!</font>

1200
00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:19.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- This is getting a little dark.
- Dark? What do you mean?</font>

1201
00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:22.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, if this is the most popular show,
give me some of the other shows?</font>

1202
00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:24.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, of course.
There's Toddler In The Wild,</font>

1203
00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.251
<font face="Comic Sans MS">there's Mommy, I'm Drowning,
there's Daddy. Where Are You Going?</font>

1204
00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:29.840
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's Building Explosion.</font>

1205
00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:31.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Building Explosion?
- Yeah, Building Explosion.</font>

1206
00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:34.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It just shows big buildings
falling down, and...</font>

1207
00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kids, like, trapped in the basement,
and the building falls,</font>

1208
00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:38.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and they're like,
"Ma, get me out of here."</font>

1209
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it shows them how
to get out in an emergency,</font>

1210
00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:43.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">but also tells them when to give up.</font>

1211
00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:46.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Bing bong! What's the delay?</font>

1212
00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:48.647
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1213
00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:52.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. There's something
trying to kill us here.</font>

1214
00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:56.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's 10,000 volts of electricity
coursing through the suits</font>

1215
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:58.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that you're wearing back here
in the studio!</font>

1216
00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:01.686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every week,
it's the same goddamn thing.</font>

1217
00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:04.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's guy on guy, girl on girl.</font>

1218
00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:07.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sometimes it's even guy on girl.</font>

1219
00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:11.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is the big deal with the two
of you boys sleeping together?</font>

1220
00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:14.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're acting like it's 2010,
for Christ's sakes.</font>

1221
00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:18.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now, we got a show to do, boys!
So start fucking!</font>

1222
00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:20.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dude, is there, like,
a stage manager around?</font>

1223
00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, they're gonna kill these guys.</font>

1224
00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:23.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm sorry. Look.</font>

1225
00:57:23.560 --> 00:57:26.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you're gonna sit next to me,
I need to know right now,</font>

1226
00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">do you have a problem with this show?</font>

1227
00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, yeah, clearly I have
a problem with this show.</font>

1228
00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:31.691
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, look, this is grotesque.</font>

1229
00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob. This is a great show.</font>

1230
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is the number one show
in the nation.</font>

1231
00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:37.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a show that families enjoy.</font>

1232
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:39.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay?
- This is a family show?</font>

1233
00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Absolutely.
- Like, it's on at, like, 8:00?</font>

1234
00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:44.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's on at 7:00 on Sunday nights
against Butthole Nation.</font>

1235
00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.884
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And it always wins.</font>

1236
00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:54.130
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Classic Lou.</font>

1237
00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:00.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1238
00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:06.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1239
00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:08.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, Lou.</font>

1240
00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:11.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know you are, buddy! I know!</font>

1241
00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:13.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know. I love you, man!</font>

1242
00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:14.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't say that!</font>

1243
00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:16.568
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna have an emotional
connection to this moment!</font>

1244
00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:19.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What... God forbid a couple of friends</font>

1245
00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">can't express
their brotherly love for each other!</font>

1246
00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:22.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I love you.</font>

1247
00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I told you to stop saying that!</font>

1248
00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:26.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so sorry!</font>

1249
00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.849
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So there are no more sex taboos?</font>

1250
00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, I guess bestiality.</font>

1251
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But only from
a community property perspective.</font>

1252
00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you mean?</font>

1253
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, you don't remember
Llama v. Ferguson?</font>

1254
00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guy tries to divorce a llama,</font>

1255
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:42.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and the land is in dispute
because the llama needs to graze?</font>

1256
00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:45.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But people still eat animals, right?</font>

1257
00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:48.603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, yeah, absolutely. And animals
eat people, it's all the same.</font>

1258
00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:53.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You got a tuft of hair
coming out your crack.</font>

1259
00:58:53.600 --> 00:58:55.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't fuckin' worry about it, okay?</font>

1260
00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll get your grooming tips later.</font>

1261
00:58:57.400 --> 00:58:58.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are you ready?
- Yeah.</font>

1262
00:58:58.560 --> 00:58:59.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. I love you.</font>

1263
00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:04.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right! Put it in slow!</font>

1264
00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:05.964
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Really slow!</font>

1265
00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.606
<font face="Comic Sans MS">One...</font>

1266
00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Two...</font>

1267
00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.244
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Take that dick.
- What the fuck?</font>

1268
00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:12.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on! It's just something I say.</font>

1269
00:59:12.720 --> 00:59:13.926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"Take that dick"?</font>

1270
00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait, hold on! Stop, stop, stop!</font>

1271
00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:24.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Looks like somebody chose a lifeline!</font>

1272
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:26.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me! Me! I did it! I chose it!</font>

1273
00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.442
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who will the lucky winner be?</font>

1274
00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:29.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What happens? Do we get waffles?</font>

1275
00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What happened?
- It's a lifeline,</font>

1276
00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so the chooser picks a new doozer.</font>

1277
00:59:33.120 --> 00:59:34.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You gotta choose someone, Lou.</font>

1278
00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choose waffles.</font>

1279
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:38.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, I get it. I get it.</font>

1280
00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. All right.</font>

1281
00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:44.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know just the guy.
He loves this show.</font>

1282
00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no. I'm...</font>

1283
00:59:49.640 --> 00:59:52.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm actually getting married tonight,
so I can't.</font>

1284
00:59:53.520 --> 00:59:55.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's actually an issue of fidelity.</font>

1285
00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:56.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I cannot do this.</font>

1286
00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a monster, Lou.</font>

1287
01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:05.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's up?</font>

1288
01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get ready, 'cause here it comes.</font>

1289
01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:08.287
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here what comes?</font>

1290
01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's my butt!</font>

1291
01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:18.484
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wow! That was good TV.</font>

1292
01:00:20.720 --> 01:00:22.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what, Adam,
I thought about it.</font>

1293
01:00:22.480 --> 01:00:24.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can call me Uncle Lou now.</font>

1294
01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit! Did you see that?</font>

1295
01:00:27.480 --> 01:00:29.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a fucking lunatic!</font>

1296
01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Was that the same car?
- Couldn't be.</font>

1297
01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That car tried to
run me down on purpose.</font>

1298
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you see that?</font>

1299
01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:37.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What if that car's my murderer?</font>

1300
01:00:37.480 --> 01:00:39.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You were shot in the dick in the past,
remember?</font>

1301
01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Like that would be
the craziest fucking thing</font>

1302
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">that's ever happened to us.
That car's an asshole.</font>

1303
01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:46.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The car's not an asshole.
You're an asshole.</font>

1304
01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:48.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa. Where'd that come from?</font>

1305
01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:52.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything is all about Lou.
No regard for anybody else.</font>

1306
01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm pretty sure that's never
been the case at all, ever.</font>

1307
01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because of you, Adam just got raped.</font>

1308
01:00:57.160 --> 01:00:58.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are we calling it a rape?</font>

1309
01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.050
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Nobody got raped.</font>

1310
01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It felt like kind of a gray area.</font>

1311
01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a fucking virus, Lou.</font>

1312
01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You find a vulnerable host,</font>

1313
01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and you attach yourself
and you just fuck 'em all up.</font>

1314
01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.366
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1315
01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Someone needs
to find a chill-out tent.</font>

1316
01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's get you a comfy couch and
a video game. What do you say?</font>

1317
01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:18.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where does it say in the Shitty Parent's
Handbook to treat your son like shit?</font>

1318
01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, if it's a Shitty Parent's
Handbook,</font>

1319
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:23.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wouldn't it be, like,
the theme of the whole book?</font>

1320
01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.043
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No, he's right. Wait.
- No, no, no.</font>

1321
01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.766
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a step-by-step guide
for how to be a shitty parent.</font>

1322
01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Exactly.
- Shitty Parenting for Dummies.</font>

1323
01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:32.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. You're right. I apologize.</font>

1324
01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:34.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I apologize. You were totally wrong.</font>

1325
01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:37.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, why would someone write that book?
Why would that book exist?</font>

1326
01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Actually, Nick's idea about retitling it</font>

1327
01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shitty Parenting for Dummies
is a solid idea.</font>

1328
01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:43.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- If you want to use the metaphor again.
- It's an impulse buy.</font>

1329
01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, you know what?
Forget it. You're right, that's fair.</font>

1330
01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a misleading title.
But the point is...</font>

1331
01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you!</font>

1332
01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If they're not gonna say it, I will.</font>

1333
01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I am so tired of solving your problems.</font>

1334
01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You wanna stop your murder,
figure it out yourself.</font>

1335
01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:57.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to Winkle's.</font>

1336
01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jacob, what the fuck?
- Youngblood!</font>

1337
01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:02.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You know why?
'Cause as long as we're here,</font>

1338
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:05.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Jacob fucking Dorchen!
And that means something.</font>

1339
01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob, come on!</font>

1340
01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.485
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Youngblood, we got to figure this out.</font>

1341
01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the only one
keeping track of important stuff!</font>

1342
01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:14.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean...</font>

1343
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what? Fuck it. Fuck it.</font>

1344
01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:17.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who cares? Who needs him?
I don't need him.</font>

1345
01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:19.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I'm getting married today, guys.</font>

1346
01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:21.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you say we kick this day
in the pants</font>

1347
01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and get over there early
for some Bloody Mary-tinis?</font>

1348
01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.
Can I just get rid of this thing?</font>

1349
01:02:26.040 --> 01:02:28.520
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No! She said not to
take it off for 24 hours.</font>

1350
01:02:28.640 --> 01:02:29.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Or what?
- I don't know.</font>

1351
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, exactly.
If I had a dime for every time</font>

1352
01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did something a cocktail waitress
told me not to do,</font>

1353
01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'd be rich. Look.</font>

1354
01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:43.322
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, my God,
the cocktail waitress was wrong.</font>

1355
01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:44.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry, my mistake.</font>

1356
01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I should listen to you more often, Lou.</font>

1357
01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right.</font>

1358
01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:48.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You just learned a valuable life lesson.</font>

1359
01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:49.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did.</font>

1360
01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:53.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys?</font>

1361
01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:55.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on.</font>

1362
01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:03.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">God. So...</font>

1363
01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- 911, right?
- Yeah.</font>

1364
01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking disgusting, dude!</font>

1365
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, you're sick. You made your point.</font>

1366
01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, Lou,
you know he can't help it.</font>

1367
01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:27.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay, buddy?</font>

1368
01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, this is becoming
a bit of a hygiene issue.</font>

1369
01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:33.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right, let's see what we have here.</font>

1370
01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:35.483
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, yeah.</font>

1371
01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:38.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kel.</font>

1372
01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:39.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, really?</font>

1373
01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:42.809
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Divorced? What the fuck
are you talking about?</font>

1374
01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Kelly, we're soul mates.</font>

1375
01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:46.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not anymore.</font>

1376
01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:50.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mommy?
- No, I'm not your mommy.</font>

1377
01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Homie?
- Yeah, I'm your homie.</font>

1378
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Was it something you did?</font>

1379
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:57.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If so, I don't care.
I don't care. I forgive you.</font>

1380
01:03:57.880 --> 01:03:59.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put this in his mouth.</font>

1381
01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:01.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If you don't communicate with me,
I can't fix this!</font>

1382
01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:02.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You can't fix anything.</font>

1383
01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:06.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, bite down on this. Good. Okay.</font>

1384
01:04:06.240 --> 01:04:07.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

1385
01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:08.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go.</font>

1386
01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1387
01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's actually not bad.</font>

1388
01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:15.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, it's, like, kind of sweet.</font>

1389
01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's happening to him?</font>

1390
01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is totally normal.</font>

1391
01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:20.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nanobots are attacking
the narcotics.</font>

1392
01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:22.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How long has he been on heroin?</font>

1393
01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was a Ladybug.</font>

1394
01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:25.563
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, the sticker?
- Yeah, on the neck.</font>

1395
01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. We normally give Tylenol for that.</font>

1396
01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just pumped him full of...</font>

1397
01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Narcotic-seeking nanobots?</font>

1398
01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- Whoops.</font>

1399
01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a great listener.
I should have married you.</font>

1400
01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:36.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, Kel, I'm sorry, okay?</font>

1401
01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1402
01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Can we just move on?</font>

1403
01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:44.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I did move on, Lou. I got clean.</font>

1404
01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:46.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're the one who doesn't
have a rock bottom.</font>

1405
01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just pray that
there's still hope for Jacob.</font>

1406
01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This ain't a circus!</font>

1407
01:04:52.280 --> 01:04:54.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Quit juggling
and make some fucking drinks!</font>

1408
01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:56.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey! Jake the Snake!</font>

1409
01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, is it still day out there?</font>

1410
01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who gives a shit? What can I get you?</font>

1411
01:05:00.120 --> 01:05:01.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll take everything!</font>

1412
01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You sure about that?</font>

1413
01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:05.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">'Cause, remember what
happened last time?</font>

1414
01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.531
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Everything.</font>

1415
01:05:08.120 --> 01:05:09.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1416
01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right!
Set Mr. Dorchen up with the usual...</font>

1417
01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:14.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And, you know, call security.</font>

1418
01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:17.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The nanobots can't find any drugs,</font>

1419
01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:18.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so they're traveling to
the lowest part of his body,</font>

1420
01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">where they'll harden and expand.</font>

1421
01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- His feet?
- In his testicles.</font>

1422
01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that hardly seems like
the lowest part of his body.</font>

1423
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:28.042
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shit!
- What's happening?</font>

1424
01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. It's now or never.</font>

1425
01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:30.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?</font>

1426
01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa, whoa, whoa!</font>

1427
01:05:32.800 --> 01:05:33.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What is that?</font>

1428
01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:34.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What you gonna do with that?</font>

1429
01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stick him! Stick him!</font>

1430
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit!</font>

1431
01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:48.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's a lot of juice!</font>

1432
01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.011
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay! Enough!</font>

1433
01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:52.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now what's gonna happen,
I'm going to pull this out,</font>

1434
01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:53.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and there might be some leakage, okay?</font>

1435
01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't pull it out. Don't pull it out.</font>

1436
01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:57.688
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I like it where it is.
- 1, 2, 3...</font>

1437
01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.090
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow! Okay.
- Fuck your ball juice!</font>

1438
01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:08.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I walked right into that one. Literally.</font>

1439
01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:11.642
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know about you guys,
but I feel way better.</font>

1440
01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's definitely semen in that.</font>

1441
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.082
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's definitely fucking semen
in that.</font>

1442
01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:19.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you taste the robots?
They're gritty.</font>

1443
01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:25.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fucking bottle service.</font>

1444
01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:27.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1445
01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:34.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Every fucking weekend.</font>

1446
01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:36.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, baby.</font>

1447
01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:38.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a fuck-up, Jacob.</font>

1448
01:06:39.440 --> 01:06:40.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just like your loser dad.</font>

1449
01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not anything like my fucking dad!</font>

1450
01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:51.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No... No, wait, wait, wait.</font>

1451
01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:55.087
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait.</font>

1452
01:06:56.080 --> 01:06:58.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know how this looks.</font>

1453
01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:01.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. You don't.</font>

1454
01:07:06.560 --> 01:07:09.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You see my son? Do you know my son?</font>

1455
01:07:10.720 --> 01:07:12.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob!</font>

1456
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Has anybody seen
a grown-up Garbage Pail Kid?</font>

1457
01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's Winkle.</font>

1458
01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I pay you girls to like me. Hey, smile!</font>

1459
01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:22.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey!</font>

1460
01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:25.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Electric Ladybug, huh?</font>

1461
01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:27.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fuck you, dude!
- Yeah.</font>

1462
01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:28.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, how you doing?</font>

1463
01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm doing fucking shitty, Gary.</font>

1464
01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:32.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Still haven't found my killer,
and there's a car trying to run me down.</font>

1465
01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:34.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I hear you there, brother.</font>

1466
01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.929
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had a Passat follow me
around for 3 weeks one time.</font>

1467
01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Had to buy it rims to make it go away.</font>

1468
01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what I'm talking about, huh?</font>

1469
01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:40.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Where's Jacob?</font>

1470
01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had to throw him out, like I always do.
You know what I mean?</font>

1471
01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:45.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He said something about going
to see his family therapist,</font>

1472
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">whoever the fuck that is.</font>

1473
01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.404
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know where he is.</font>

1474
01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:05.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm not that strong.</font>

1475
01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, son.</font>

1476
01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's Daddy.</font>

1477
01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a nice... Nice place.</font>

1478
01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, yeah.</font>

1479
01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, like, as far as rooms go,
this is one of the biggest.</font>

1480
01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- A great room is a great room.
- I could see myself chilling here.</font>

1481
01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:44.331
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right. Throwing some football.</font>

1482
01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:46.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Having a football match right
in the middle of the floor.</font>

1483
01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:49.411
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Football, basketball,
you know, just all the sports.</font>

1484
01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:51.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm so comfortable
and relaxed right now.</font>

1485
01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Me, too.</font>

1486
01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:55.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Adam...
- Yeah.</font>

1487
01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...about what happened
at Choozy Doozy...</font>

1488
01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:59.603
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, it was... You know, it was virtual.</font>

1489
01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.002
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Virtual.</font>

1490
01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So it was just like...</font>

1491
01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:04.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's in the ether.</font>

1492
01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:06.683
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It does not exist.
- Who cares?</font>

1493
01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That shit happened.</font>

1494
01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, we should get
that show cancelled.</font>

1495
01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or at least arrest someone.</font>

1496
01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:13.124
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I could've ate some goddamn waffles.</font>

1497
01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:17.367
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's like you shoved
a fucking Buick up my butt.</font>

1498
01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got a Buick dick.</font>

1499
01:09:20.040 --> 01:09:21.371
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You do.</font>

1500
01:09:22.360 --> 01:09:24.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit got bad, Lou.</font>

1501
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean bad like the part
of Boogie Nights</font>

1502
01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.726
<font face="Comic Sans MS">after Mark Wahlberg jerks off
in the pickup truck.</font>

1503
01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, here we are,
with the greatest power</font>

1504
01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.051
<font face="Comic Sans MS">the universe has to offer
at our fingertips</font>

1505
01:09:35.560 --> 01:09:38.723
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and we're just a bunch of fuck-ups.</font>

1506
01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:43.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob, I know
what you're going through.</font>

1507
01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I know that you do.
You're the biggest fuck-up I know.</font>

1508
01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:47.845
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look.</font>

1509
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:52.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, all Dorchen men
end up on a roof</font>

1510
01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">at some point in their lives.</font>

1511
01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:57.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We party till we want to kill ourselves.
My dad did it.</font>

1512
01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:59.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And your son will do it after you.</font>

1513
01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:01.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Even Grandpappy Dorchen?</font>

1514
01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:04.246
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jumped off a roof, survived,
died of syphilis.</font>

1515
01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob, how can we expect
to find happiness</font>

1516
01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:12.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">anywhere in time
if we're just not happy people?</font>

1517
01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.602
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We do the best that we can.</font>

1518
01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here comes the hug monster.</font>

1519
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:32.844
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Come on.
Let's go do some more dumb shit.</font>

1520
01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoa!
- I got you!</font>

1521
01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lou, don't drop me!
- I got you!</font>

1522
01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:42.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't drop me!
- I'm not gonna let you fall, I promise.</font>

1523
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I trust you.
- Okay.</font>

1524
01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:45.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fuck, I'm gonna drop you!
- Don't drop me! Don't drop me!</font>

1525
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:46.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm dropping you! You fell!</font>

1526
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:48.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you!</font>

1527
01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1528
01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:53.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Suicide prevention activated.</font>

1529
01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look at that. Force field.</font>

1530
01:10:56.040 --> 01:10:57.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a great call.</font>

1531
01:10:57.200 --> 01:10:58.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I must have invented that.</font>

1532
01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:01.121
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Seriously. Thank you, Dad.</font>

1533
01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My pleasure, son.</font>

1534
01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:05.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Is it fun?
- Yeah, it's kind of fun.</font>

1535
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:08.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?
I'm coming down, too!</font>

1536
01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.402
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Guys, guys, guys, come on!</font>

1537
01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We got a murder to solve here, huh?</font>

1538
01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's think. It's not Winkle.</font>

1539
01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's obviously not Jacob.</font>

1540
01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:18.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Right?
- Hey.</font>

1541
01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- No? Right.
- Come on. Come on.</font>

1542
01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:21.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All right. Okay.</font>

1543
01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:26.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Some curious news out
of the tech sector today.</font>

1544
01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A new synthetic element
has been developed.</font>

1545
01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:32.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The new element invented
by Brad Syed of Lougle Labs,</font>

1546
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:35.323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is tentatively being
called nitrotrinadium.</font>

1547
01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's it.</font>

1548
01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Brad never liked me.
- No?</font>

1549
01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And Brad's going to Adam's wedding.</font>

1550
01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:44.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I keep forgetting you guys know Brad.</font>

1551
01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:47.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's gonna be fun, my wedding.
I'm looking forward to it.</font>

1552
01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck! My wedding!</font>

1553
01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jill's going to kill me.
I have to go change.</font>

1554
01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, God. I can't believe
that son of a bitch stole my idea.</font>

1555
01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:09.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's split up and find Brad on three.
One, two, three.</font>

1556
01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Split up and find Brad</font>

1557
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:12.169
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before he goes back in time
and kills Lou!</font>

1558
01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wow! We are so locked in.
- Same page.</font>

1559
01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:15.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- We are so locked in.
- Same page.</font>

1560
01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:16.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- That's awesome.
- Right.</font>

1561
01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.088
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's normal for men
to blow off some steam</font>

1562
01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:20.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before their wedding, right?</font>

1563
01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:23.883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam? What'd he do,
have a light lunch and a spa day?</font>

1564
01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He did drugs and had sex with a man
he barely knows on national TV.</font>

1565
01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:30.689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That doesn't sound like Adam.</font>

1566
01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Honey, like you said,
he's just blowing off steam.</font>

1567
01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why didn't I blow off steam?
I have steam to blow off.</font>

1568
01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:38.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All I did was get my hair done!</font>

1569
01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It looks beautiful.
- Shut up, you dumb slut.</font>

1570
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You blew half of Pittsburgh
before your bachelorette party.</font>

1571
01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:44.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get me some champagne.</font>

1572
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:52.890
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know what's taking Jill.</font>

1573
01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You think she saw Choozy Doozy?</font>

1574
01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:56.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Does she watch it?</font>

1575
01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's her favorite show.</font>

1576
01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.400
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Then she probably saw it.</font>

1577
01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1578
01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:02.447
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sorry.</font>

1579
01:13:05.600 --> 01:13:08.604
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This isn't good. She's never late. Ever.</font>

1580
01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do you think she and I
are gonna be okay?</font>

1581
01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:13.286
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know, man.
I'm not the guy to ask about marriage.</font>

1582
01:13:13.520 --> 01:13:15.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Wait, are you married?
- Yeah. Well...</font>

1583
01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know. I hope so.</font>

1584
01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:21.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Well, I have to find Jill.</font>

1585
01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Will you cover for me?</font>

1586
01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, we gotta find Brad.</font>

1587
01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.762
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck a dude. Fuck two dudes.</font>

1588
01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:29.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">"I'm Adam.
I get plowed by dudes on TV."</font>

1589
01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:33.601
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Eeny, meeny, miney, drunk.</font>

1590
01:13:35.440 --> 01:13:36.646
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Choozy Boozey.</font>

1591
01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So sorry. Wrong room.</font>

1592
01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Oh, shit.</font>

1593
01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:52.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Anybody know a Brad Syed? Report...</font>

1594
01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:54.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, Nick Webber. Do the dance.</font>

1595
01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:56.405
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to do the dance?</font>

1596
01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, do the dance.</font>

1597
01:13:57.640 --> 01:13:59.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You want me to do the fucking dance?</font>

1598
01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1599
01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:07.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is who I've become, isn't it?</font>

1600
01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:09.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The dancing clown.</font>

1601
01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The man who will apparently do anything</font>

1602
01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:14.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to keep his shitty career going.</font>

1603
01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:16.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Meanwhile, when's the last time</font>

1604
01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I shared a romantic dinner
with my wife?</font>

1605
01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:21.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Or just did anything,
just the two of us?</font>

1606
01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:22.686
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's been a minute.</font>

1607
01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll bet there's a lot
of people here tonight</font>

1608
01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.329
<font face="Comic Sans MS">who have been taken for granted.</font>

1609
01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:29.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This lady right here.</font>

1610
01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">When's the last time your man
gave you flowers, just because?</font>

1611
01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:34.567
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck you, dude.</font>

1612
01:14:34.680 --> 01:14:38.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right? On this special occasion,</font>

1613
01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">be thankful for the one you're with.</font>

1614
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make each moment count.</font>

1615
01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:46.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Remember why you fell in love.</font>

1616
01:14:48.200 --> 01:14:49.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Now do the dance!</font>

1617
01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah!</font>

1618
01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.364
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Do it! Do it!</font>

1619
01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.883
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck it. D.J.!</font>

1620
01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:13.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Brad.
- Hey, Jacob...</font>

1621
01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.611
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa...</font>

1622
01:15:16.720 --> 01:15:19.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Give me the nitrotrinadium, Brad!
Give me the fuckin' nitro!</font>

1623
01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay, okay.
- Slowly.</font>

1624
01:15:21.960 --> 01:15:22.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Slowly.</font>

1625
01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:26.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Be very careful, it's my only one.
I only trust you with it.</font>

1626
01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:28.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You thought you had it all
figured out, didn't ya?</font>

1627
01:15:29.080 --> 01:15:30.923
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just gonna go back in time
and kill my dad.</font>

1628
01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.491
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Kill your dad?
- Yeah.</font>

1629
01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:33.926
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know your plan, Brad.</font>

1630
01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:35.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, sure, I thought about it.</font>

1631
01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A lot. When I worked for him.</font>

1632
01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I knew it.</font>

1633
01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:40.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But why would I wanna kill
the man partly responsible</font>

1634
01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:42.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">for the greatest scientific
achievement of all time?</font>

1635
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There was no such thing
as nitrotrinadium</font>

1636
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:49.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">when your dad gave me
the idea for it 10 years ago.</font>

1637
01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...for time travel!</font>

1638
01:15:50.840 --> 01:15:52.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had a history of pulling great ideas</font>

1639
01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:53.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- out of his ass...
- Boom!</font>

1640
01:15:54.080 --> 01:15:56.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">...and god damn it, he did it again.</font>

1641
01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm gonna be in the lab,
trying to save this company.</font>

1642
01:15:59.200 --> 01:16:00.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I dedicated my life's work</font>

1643
01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to making Lou Dorchen's
vision a reality.</font>

1644
01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait. So you are the inventor
of time travel.</font>

1645
01:16:06.520 --> 01:16:08.443
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right? It's fucking awesome.</font>

1646
01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:11.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you weren't gonna go back to 2015
and shoot him in the dick.</font>

1647
01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:12.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shoot him?</font>

1648
01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:16.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">If I was going to kill your dad,
it wouldn't be with a gun.</font>

1649
01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:20.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What I would do is spike his morning
cocktail with a potent sedative</font>

1650
01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">before dragging his body
to the Gulf and...</font>

1651
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Feeding it to a shark.</font>

1652
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- It's the perfect plan.</font>

1653
01:16:26.960 --> 01:16:29.361
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you having
as fantastic a time as I am?</font>

1654
01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:31.323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up! This isn't making love!</font>

1655
01:16:31.480 --> 01:16:33.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is a "fuck you" to my fiance!</font>

1656
01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.645
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Right, right, right, right. Okay.</font>

1657
01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.406
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Fuck me, Uncle Lou!
- Whoa! Whoa! Hold on!</font>

1658
01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:38.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle by marriage!</font>

1659
01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.449
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I feel like that is
an important distinction to make.</font>

1660
01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck me, Uncle Lou by marriage!</font>

1661
01:16:42.120 --> 01:16:43.690
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe I'm fucking</font>

1662
01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.962
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam's father's future daughter-in-law!</font>

1663
01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:50.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't believe I'm fucking
Adam's father's sister's husband!</font>

1664
01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:52.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam! Have you seen Lou?</font>

1665
01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That Jacuzzi time machine thing,
is that real?</font>

1666
01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's a hot tub.
- Whatever!</font>

1667
01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen, Adam, I'm sorry,
I gotta be a stickler on this.</font>

1668
01:17:01.480 --> 01:17:02.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacuzzi is a brand name, and...</font>

1669
01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shut up! How does it work?</font>

1670
01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.047
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- How does it work?
- This!</font>

1671
01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:12.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the only nitrotrinadium
in the whole world!</font>

1672
01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:16.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 fucking years!
It was a bitch to make, dude!</font>

1673
01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:19.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know, Brad.
I didn't mean to fuckin' lose it.</font>

1674
01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:20.970
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He got the jump on me.</font>

1675
01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But he's so much smaller than you.</font>

1676
01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:26.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He had, like, super-human strength,
like that fucking baby in Superman I.</font>

1677
01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You mean Baby Superman?
That baby was Superman.</font>

1678
01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I mean...</font>

1679
01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.523
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That baby was Superman, Jacob!</font>

1680
01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:37.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Hey.</font>

1681
01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Any luck?</font>

1682
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- You found him?</font>

1683
01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.480
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit! No. Brad. No, you?</font>

1684
01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nah. Dude.</font>

1685
01:17:46.960 --> 01:17:49.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">10 years of my life.</font>

1686
01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Handle it.</font>

1687
01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Instead of linear,
think of space-time as being fluid...</font>

1688
01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey.
- Hey, Lou.</font>

1689
01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">America!</font>

1690
01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:02.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Brad was helping.
He's not the murderer.</font>

1691
01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.325
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Oops.
- Then what happened?</font>

1692
01:18:07.440 --> 01:18:10.205
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam took the nitro.
He's going back to 2015 to kill you.</font>

1693
01:18:10.320 --> 01:18:13.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam Junior's the murderer?
Why would he do that?</font>

1694
01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:16.245
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think...</font>

1695
01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:18.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You guys
are gonna think this is hilarious.</font>

1696
01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I may have</font>

1697
01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.403
<font face="Comic Sans MS">fucked his wife. A tiny bit! A tiny bit.</font>

1698
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:27.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, in her vagina, or whatever.</font>

1699
01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, Lou!</font>

1700
01:18:28.320 --> 01:18:29.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">So you just created your own killer.</font>

1701
01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- So I'm the bad guy now!
- Yes!</font>

1702
01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yes.</font>

1703
01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:34.401
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on!</font>

1704
01:18:34.640 --> 01:18:35.687
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck!</font>

1705
01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:37.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit.</font>

1706
01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Baby Adam got away.</font>

1707
01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:41.921
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Shit. Look, look, look!</font>

1708
01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come on, come on, come on...</font>

1709
01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no, no, no!
This has got to end now.</font>

1710
01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou...</font>

1711
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:50.290
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lou, what are you doing?
- Lou, get out of the road.</font>

1712
01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:51.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Lou!
- I know what I'm doing!</font>

1713
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:52.967
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Get the fuck out of the street!</font>

1714
01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:54.605
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You don't know what you're doing.
You're going to die!</font>

1715
01:18:55.440 --> 01:18:56.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou, would you come the fuck on?</font>

1716
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:57.760
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let me do this! I got this!</font>

1717
01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.126
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got this!</font>

1718
01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:00.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Stop!</font>

1719
01:19:05.520 --> 01:19:07.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. Okay.</font>

1720
01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:11.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, okay, okay! I mean it.</font>

1721
01:19:11.120 --> 01:19:13.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do. I mean it.
I'm a dick. Ask my friends.</font>

1722
01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He's a dick.
- Big ol' dick.</font>

1723
01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, I get you. I do.</font>

1724
01:19:17.280 --> 01:19:19.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what it's like
to feel unappreciated,</font>

1725
01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">like just a member of the pack.</font>

1726
01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.860
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want you to know that
despite what I said before,</font>

1727
01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I do appreciate you.</font>

1728
01:19:27.480 --> 01:19:29.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm appealing to your
sense of humanity right now.</font>

1729
01:19:30.480 --> 01:19:33.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There is a maniac trying to kill me.</font>

1730
01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:36.801
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I'm asking you
to be the bigger car and help me out.</font>

1731
01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:43.166
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just a guy looking at a car</font>

1732
01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.164
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and asking it to love me.</font>

1733
01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:07.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Listen. You can't go with me, okay?</font>

1734
01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:08.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Scat!</font>

1735
01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:14.006
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, listen.</font>

1736
01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'll be back, okay? I promise.
I'll be back.</font>

1737
01:20:16.360 --> 01:20:19.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We'll go all the places that
we never got to go, okay?</font>

1738
01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:20.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just</font>

1739
01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:23.763
<font face="Comic Sans MS">wait for me. You</font>

1740
01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:26.323
<font face="Comic Sans MS">stay blue.</font>

1741
01:20:35.200 --> 01:20:37.009
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit. Shit. Shit.</font>

1742
01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:40.649
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We're too late. We just missed him.</font>

1743
01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:44.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess that's it. We're stuck here.</font>

1744
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That means in a minute, Lou's going to</font>

1745
01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:48.806
<font face="Comic Sans MS">disappear.</font>

1746
01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. That can't be right. Right, Jacob?</font>

1747
01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:55.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you got...
You got a plan or something.</font>

1748
01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No. We just got to...</font>

1749
01:20:57.600 --> 01:20:59.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are we gonna do?</font>

1750
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Fuck, I don't know.</font>

1751
01:21:01.360 --> 01:21:02.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't know.</font>

1752
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.925
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, Lou.</font>

1753
01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:23.886
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'll miss you, brother.
- I'll miss you, too.</font>

1754
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:32.362
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. Before I forget,</font>

1755
01:21:33.040 --> 01:21:34.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">will you just keep an eye on him?</font>

1756
01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:38.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's got such a big future ahead of him.</font>

1757
01:21:39.080 --> 01:21:40.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Obviously.
- Yeah.</font>

1758
01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:47.721
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I got it.</font>

1759
01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob, it's okay. Don't...</font>

1760
01:21:49.160 --> 01:21:50.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, no.</font>

1761
01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:53.489
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Our nitro was missing
because it didn't exist yet.</font>

1762
01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:56.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But if Adam took the nitro to the past,</font>

1763
01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:58.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">then it exists here in the future.</font>

1764
01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.091
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit!</font>

1765
01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:05.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's still time.</font>

1766
01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:07.010
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Jacob!
- Let's go!</font>

1767
01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:11.128
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta go back to the past
to save the future.</font>

1768
01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What does this remind you of?</font>

1769
01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:13.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Terminator.</font>

1770
01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:14.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Always Terminator.
- Always Terminator. I know.</font>

1771
01:22:14.880 --> 01:22:16.086
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's go save Lou's life.</font>

1772
01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:17.440
<font face="Comic Sans MS">High five.</font>

1773
01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:18.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">High five.</font>

1774
01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is my favorite part!</font>

1775
01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:29.451
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Here we go! Here we go!</font>

1776
01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:46.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I think we made it!
- Let's go!</font>

1777
01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:47.486
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Let's go!
- Okay.</font>

1778
01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.804
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's the party. And there's still time!</font>

1779
01:22:55.040 --> 01:22:57.247
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He's gotta be around here somewhere!</font>

1780
01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:00.360
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We are live!</font>

1781
01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:03.167
<font face="Comic Sans MS">From Lougle Mansion.</font>

1782
01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:08.328
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Worth 2.3 billion dollars, introducing</font>

1783
01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou "the Violator"</font>

1784
01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.650
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dorchen!</font>

1785
01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:26.765
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, everybody.
- Lou!</font>

1786
01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:31.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou, I found him.</font>

1787
01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.250
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm going to shoot you in the dick</font>

1788
01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:35.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you can't fuck anyone else's wife!</font>

1789
01:23:35.560 --> 01:23:36.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Technically, you all aren't married yet,</font>

1790
01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:38.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- so she's not your wife.
- Yes, she is!</font>

1791
01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:40.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam, I hate to be a stickler,
but you guys haven't met yet.</font>

1792
01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:42.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- It's 2015.
- Shut the fuck up!</font>

1793
01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Mazel tov!
- Congratulations!</font>

1794
01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you doing?
What are you doing?</font>

1795
01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:52.202
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's probably pretty hard
to shoot a man, right?</font>

1796
01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:53.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't.</font>

1797
01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay. It's okay. Watch.</font>

1798
01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:59.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm just gonna make it
easier on you. Look.</font>

1799
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:05.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Shotgun to the dick.
- His destiny.</font>

1800
01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.722
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I turned you into a murderer.</font>

1801
01:24:08.360 --> 01:24:09.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've just ruined my own life.</font>

1802
01:24:09.600 --> 01:24:12.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I have so much fuckin' poison in me
that I've ruined yours, too.</font>

1803
01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:13.891
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jacob was right.</font>

1804
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:15.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a virus.</font>

1805
01:24:16.720 --> 01:24:19.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is your revenge to take. Okay?</font>

1806
01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:21.800
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1807
01:24:25.320 --> 01:24:26.651
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen my future.</font>

1808
01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.564
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You saw it. I'm a disaster.</font>

1809
01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.561
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's okay.</font>

1810
01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:33.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just kill me
and put us both out of our misery?</font>

1811
01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Please.</font>

1812
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I can't. I can't do it.</font>

1813
01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.607
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jesus Christ,
do I have to fucking do everything?</font>

1814
01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:42.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou...</font>

1815
01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:44.241
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No!</font>

1816
01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:50.131
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You okay?</font>

1817
01:24:52.920 --> 01:24:54.684
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're fucking crazy, Lou.</font>

1818
01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:04.490
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry, I may have shit my pants.</font>

1819
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:06.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's all right.
It was a stressful situation.</font>

1820
01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:08.522
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It was really stressful. I'm exhausted.</font>

1821
01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.125
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm so sorry.
- I'm sorry.</font>

1822
01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:12.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Jill?</font>

1823
01:25:12.920 --> 01:25:14.410
<font face="Comic Sans MS">How did you know my...</font>

1824
01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">My nametag.</font>

1825
01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.004
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, it's because you're my...</font>

1826
01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. This is just...
This is weird.</font>

1827
01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:26.648
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Up until yesterday,
I thought I had a normal life.</font>

1828
01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:28.340
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I know what you mean. I...</font>

1829
01:25:28.440 --> 01:25:31.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Have you ever felt like
your entire life was a fraud?</font>

1830
01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:33.802
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry. "Fraud"
is the wrong word. "Lie"?</font>

1831
01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:38.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Adam.</font>

1832
01:25:38.560 --> 01:25:40.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- I'm...
- Jill. I know.</font>

1833
01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:42.805
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lovely tuxedo you're wearing.</font>

1834
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.207
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Thank you. Well, it's for our...</font>

1835
01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.881
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Forgot what I was going to say.</font>

1836
01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:02.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Well, that was exciting.</font>

1837
01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:04.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I guess it's not a Lougle party
until somebody gets shot at.</font>

1838
01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:05.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't want to go to the Grammys.</font>

1839
01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:06.940
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No?</font>

1840
01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:08.530
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I don't wanna go
to your sister's either.</font>

1841
01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:10.330
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just want to go somewhere,
just you and me.</font>

1842
01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:13.045
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Start making things right.</font>

1843
01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:16.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I like that. Okay.</font>

1844
01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:18.165
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And I want to get out of this shirt.</font>

1845
01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:20.846
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've been in it for, like, 3 days,
and it's really loud.</font>

1846
01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:23.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come here.</font>

1847
01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.882
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Put your arms up for a sec, like that.</font>

1848
01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:29.565
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Is this a dance or something?</font>

1849
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.842
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Something like that. More of a strut.</font>

1850
01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm coming in.</font>

1851
01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:34.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay.</font>

1852
01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.927
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- There it is. Yeah.
- Okay.</font>

1853
01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:40.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This is some stupid shit.</font>

1854
01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:42.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You have no idea.</font>

1855
01:26:43.520 --> 01:26:45.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did I just hear fireworks?</font>

1856
01:26:45.120 --> 01:26:47.521
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because fireworks make me want
to puke, and you know that.</font>

1857
01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:02.570
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why are you more handsome?</font>

1858
01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm a bald person.</font>

1859
01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:06.380
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey.</font>

1860
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think about doing
a 12-step program with me?</font>

1861
01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.620
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, like, go to an awesome rehab</font>

1862
01:27:12.720 --> 01:27:16.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">with good food and a pool
and classy people.</font>

1863
01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.641
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What do you think?</font>

1864
01:27:20.960 --> 01:27:22.450
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Okay.
- Yeah?</font>

1865
01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.610
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fucking hate you, Lou.</font>

1866
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fucking hate you, Kelly.</font>

1867
01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:32.487
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Sophie! Hey! Where are you going?</font>

1868
01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:35.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">People are shooting each other.
I'm getting out of here.</font>

1869
01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:36.700
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. Here's the thing, Soph,</font>

1870
01:27:36.800 --> 01:27:38.820
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I've seen our future together
and I will be the first person</font>

1871
01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.922
<font face="Comic Sans MS">to admit that it is fucking insane.</font>

1872
01:27:41.080 --> 01:27:42.740
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The drugs, the constant partying.</font>

1873
01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:45.127
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's enough to make anybody ask,
"When is enough enough?"</font>

1874
01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.327
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What are you talking about?</font>

1875
01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:47.540
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Just stay with me here.
Just stay with me.</font>

1876
01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:48.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Did you change?</font>

1877
01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:52.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, in so many ways. But, listen,
right in the middle of that future</font>

1878
01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:55.324
<font face="Comic Sans MS">is this toxic power couple
named you and me.</font>

1879
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:57.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And does it all end in tragedy and tears</font>

1880
01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:59.408
<font face="Comic Sans MS">and a murder mystery?
Yes, of course it does.</font>

1881
01:27:59.600 --> 01:28:00.965
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But I don't care.</font>

1882
01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:02.924
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I just got one question, Sophie.</font>

1883
01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:05.644
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are you ready for the ride
of your fucking life?</font>

1884
01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:23.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- What's that in your pocket?
- My dick.</font>

1885
01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:25.681
<font face="Comic Sans MS">The other thing.</font>

1886
01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:29.160
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A billion fucking dollars.</font>

1887
01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:34.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, I just met my future wife in there.</font>

1888
01:28:34.320 --> 01:28:36.971
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, man. Hang out with us,
that kind of shit happens all the time.</font>

1889
01:28:37.160 --> 01:28:39.162
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. A lot of highs and lows here.</font>

1890
01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.850
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Yeah.
- You know, when you think about it,</font>

1891
01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou had to fuck your wife in the future,</font>

1892
01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:44.571
<font face="Comic Sans MS">so you could meet her in the past.</font>

1893
01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:47.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Well...
- Yeah. But, hey...</font>

1894
01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:48.920
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's what uncles do, right?</font>

1895
01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.841
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Not really.</font>

1896
01:28:52.800 --> 01:28:53.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey, just think of it this way.</font>

1897
01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:55.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Since it happened in the future,</font>

1898
01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.084
<font face="Comic Sans MS">it technically hasn't happened at all.</font>

1899
01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:59.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's cyclical.</font>

1900
01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:01.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. And even though
I didn't meet my dad,</font>

1901
01:29:01.320 --> 01:29:03.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I met some friends for life.</font>

1902
01:29:03.160 --> 01:29:04.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah? Who?</font>

1903
01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:06.761
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Hey, Lou?
- Uncle Lou.</font>

1904
01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Uncle Lou.</font>

1905
01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No harm, no foul,
but did you ejaculate in her?</font>

1906
01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.682
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Hey. That doesn't matter.</font>

1907
01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:17.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I ejaculated inside of you.</font>

1908
01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.600
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And that doesn't matter either.</font>

1909
01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.500
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Because those are
both just hypothetical future scenarios.</font>

1910
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:23.807
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one ejaculated inside
of anything, really.</font>

1911
01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:25.046
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No one's ejaculated.</font>

1912
01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:26.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah, I did.</font>

1913
01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:27.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know what?</font>

1914
01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:29.204
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I had this moment earlier.</font>

1915
01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:33.441
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I think it was when my nephew
from the future</font>

1916
01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:36.281
<font face="Comic Sans MS">had a shotgun pointed at my dick
that I'd helped him place there.</font>

1917
01:29:37.600 --> 01:29:38.931
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That was me.</font>

1918
01:29:39.120 --> 01:29:42.966
<font face="Comic Sans MS">But in that moment,
everything became clear to me.</font>

1919
01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.122
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We need to change people's lives.</font>

1920
01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:47.123
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Make the world a better place.</font>

1921
01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.001
<font face="Comic Sans MS">All we have to do is...</font>

1922
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.291
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Lou!</font>

1923
01:29:56.880 --> 01:29:58.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Don't listen to anything he says.</font>

1924
01:29:58.680 --> 01:29:59.727
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam?</font>

1925
01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:01.803
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What the fuck? You shot Lou!</font>

1926
01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.524
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Dad?</font>

1927
01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:04.961
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What's going on?</font>

1928
01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:07.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No time to explain. Follow me.</font>

1929
01:30:07.200 --> 01:30:08.725
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To where?</font>

1930
01:30:09.480 --> 01:30:10.527
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Cincinnati.</font>

1931
01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:12.285
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, no, Dad, wait!</font>

1932
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:15.283
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Why did my dad just kill Lou?</font>

1933
01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:20.847
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- He probably had an okay reason.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

1934
01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.843
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Wait! Don't go with Adam!</font>

1935
01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Patriot Lou.</font>

1936
01:30:28.240 --> 01:30:29.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Are those wooden teeth?</font>

1937
01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:32.171
<font face="Comic Sans MS">He looks like Cap'n Crunch
fucked Paul Revere.</font>

1938
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.900
<font face="Comic Sans MS">His hair's breathtaking.</font>

1939
01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.206
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's beautiful.</font>

1940
01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Don't listen to him.
- Why?</font>

1941
01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:40.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">It's a long story.</font>

1942
01:30:40.160 --> 01:30:41.580
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Believe me, he did us all a favor.</font>

1943
01:30:41.680 --> 01:30:43.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This one was bad.</font>

1944
01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:45.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay. The bigger question is, how...</font>

1945
01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:47.060
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That's not the only me.
You think you're the only you?</font>

1946
01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.889
<font face="Comic Sans MS">There's a ton of yous out there.</font>

1947
01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:51.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Look, you're gonna like this me
a lot better.</font>

1948
01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.930
<font face="Comic Sans MS">This me is great. Take it from me.</font>

1949
01:30:53.160 --> 01:30:54.321
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Holy shit.</font>

1950
01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:57.005
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I mean, you guys get it, right?</font>

1951
01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:00.161
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Multiple universes, like Fringe.</font>

1952
01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:03.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Nerd</font>

1953
01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a fucking nerd</font>

1954
01:31:06.880 --> 01:31:08.041
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Poindexter</font>

1955
01:31:08.200 --> 01:31:10.407
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a fucking nerd</font>

1956
01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And no one likes you</font>

1957
01:31:12.200 --> 01:31:13.201
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You're a nerd
You're a nerd...</font>

1958
01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.460
<font face="Comic Sans MS">And no one likes you</font>

1959
01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:16.020
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You suck each other's dicks</font>

1960
01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:17.220
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Whoa!
- What?</font>

1961
01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.300
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Let's...</font>

1962
01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:19.731
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm sorry.</font>

1963
01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:22.180
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Obviously not the direction
of the song, right?</font>

1964
01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.170
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I totally misread that song.
My apologies.</font>

1965
01:31:25.720 --> 01:31:27.085
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Okay, so what now?</font>

1966
01:31:27.480 --> 01:31:28.811
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. You guys gotta come with me.</font>

1967
01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:30.081
<font face="Comic Sans MS">To where?</font>

1968
01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.481
<font face="Comic Sans MS">We gotta make America happen, bro.</font>

1969
01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:38.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Ready for another dip?</font>

1970
01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:40.100
<font face="Comic Sans MS">You know, you're not gonna
be super welcome there,</font>

1971
01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.660
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- but we should totally go.
- I know.</font>

1972
01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.000
<font face="Comic Sans MS">- Are we going?
- Yeah.</font>

1973
01:31:59.520 --> 01:32:00.980
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Adam saved Lincoln!</font>

1974
01:32:01.080 --> 01:32:04.260
<font face="Comic Sans MS">That parade was the single
greatest moment of my life.</font>

1975
01:32:04.360 --> 01:32:05.420
<font face="Comic Sans MS">More so than saving Lincoln?</font>

1976
01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.851
<font face="Comic Sans MS">No, that was the third
greatest moment of my life.</font>

1977
01:32:07.200 --> 01:32:08.140
<font face="Comic Sans MS">What was the second?</font>

1978
01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.810
<font face="Comic Sans MS">A parade I attended as a child.</font>

1979
01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:15.780
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Shit, you guys.</font>

1980
01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.689
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I left my phone back in the 1800s.</font>

1981
01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:19.370
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I fed some gum to a dinosaur.</font>

1982
01:32:19.520 --> 01:32:21.363
<font face="Comic Sans MS">As long as we're coming clean,
I fucked Marilyn Monroe.</font>

1983
01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:24.643
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Yeah. Sure you did, buddy.</font>

1984
01:32:28.560 --> 01:32:30.562
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Who's a nerd now, motherfuckers, huh?</font>

1985
01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:31.960
<font face="Comic Sans MS">I'm Arthur Miller.</font>

1986
01:32:33.240 --> 01:32:34.446
<font face="Comic Sans MS">Come... Come on!</font>

1987
01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:41.500
