00:09:15.989 --> 00:09:17.857
Whoo!

178
00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:18.992
Yeah, baby!

179
00:09:19.793 --> 00:09:20.760
Garbage Man!

180
00:09:22.162 --> 00:09:23.129
[mimicking punches]

181
00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:25.298
Yeah, baby!

182
00:09:26.232 --> 00:09:27.901
[man on TV]
<i>One thing's for sure...</i>

183
00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:29.702
[grunts] Yeah!

184
00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:31.704
- [people cheering]
<i>- ...this kid had it all.</i>

185
00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.840
- Yeah!
<i>- Time to take out the trash.</i>

186
00:09:33.873 --> 00:09:34.808
<i>Yeah!</i>

187
00:09:35.275 --> 00:09:37.110
Mmm... Boo-rah!

188
00:09:37.143 --> 00:09:39.245
[bell chimes]

189
00:09:39.646 --> 00:09:41.147
Garrett "The Garbage Man"
Garrison?

190
00:09:41.181 --> 00:09:42.348
No autographs.

191
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.285
Have a nice day.

192
00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:47.987
- [door opens]

193
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:49.189
[groans]

194
00:09:58.264 --> 00:09:59.632
[sighs]

195
00:10:01.868 --> 00:10:06.005
["When I'm Gone" playing]

196
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.114
[song ends]

197
00:10:14.147 --> 00:10:17.083
Whoo! Yeah! Super cool!

198
00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:18.118
[door shuts]

199
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:20.253
Garrett "The Garbage Man."

200
00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:21.821
To what do we owe this pleasure?

201
00:10:21.855 --> 00:10:23.022
Pleasure?

202
00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:25.191
Think I come to storage auctions
for fun?

203
00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:27.193
I'm a businessman, Daryl.

204
00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:29.095
An investor.

205
00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.664
Well, I'm about to shovel some
coal into your choo-choo train.

206
00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:33.800
You're gonna love
this next unit.

207
00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.969
It's got a waterbed.

208
00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:37.937
It's got some pickaxes.

209
00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.908
It's got a huge can
of mixed nuts.

210
00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:46.012
It's got an array
of unisex turquoise blouses.

211
00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.347
That sounds terrible.

212
00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.884
I think it's also got
a 1978 Atari Cosmos.

213
00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:54.154
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1978 Atari Cosmos?

214
00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:55.722
That's what it says here.

215
00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:57.157
Those things are worth
a frickin' fortune.

216
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.458
Heck, yeah, they are.

217
00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.060
Bro,
if you make this happen for me,

218
00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:03.696
I will strongly consider
hanging out with you.

219
00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.199
- You serious, bro?
- Yep.

220
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.037
Two big buffaloes like us
out there, in the wild,

221
00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.274
wearing unisex
turquoise blouses.

222
00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.910
Oh, boy,
that's gonna cause a commotion.

223
00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:18.745
The ladies aren't
gonna know what...

224
00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:21.014
Listen, if you could keep
the hammer price under a hundy,

225
00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.149
I'll make all your weird
fanboy dreams come true.

226
00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:24.184
Okay?

227
00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:28.922
Two loose cannons,
wearing turquoise blouses.

228
00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:31.224
Yeah. Let's do it.

229
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.960
[Daryl] And we got 500 dollars,
500 dollars over here.

230
00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:36.129
We got 500 dollars.
We got six, do we have six?

231
00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.264
Do we have 600 dollars?
We got 600 dollars over here.

232
00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:41.034
I'll go over here, 700 dollars,
we got 700 dollars.

233
00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.936
We got 700 dollars here.
We got 800 dollars over here.

234
00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:44.470
- [sighs]
- We got 850. Do we hear 850?

235
00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:46.239
Do we... 850 over here.

236
00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.141
Do we hear any more?
Do we hear 900? 900?

237
00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.310
Nine hundred, going once,
900 going twice.

238
00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:51.911
And 900 going three times.

239
00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:54.515
And sold to hometown hero,

240
00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:57.383
Garrett "The Garbage Man"
Garrison, for 900 dollars.

241
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.422
[Garrett] I wouldn't cash that
for about six months.

242
00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:03.456
What?

243
00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:07.126
[whoops] Come to papa! Cosmos!

244
00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.328
Whoo! [blows]

245
00:12:17.203 --> 00:12:19.005
[orb chiming softly]

246
00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.541
[Garrett] Daryl? Where is it?

247
00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:22.175
I'm sorry.
I didn't check the box.

248
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.378
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- [Garrett] Where's the Atari?

249
00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.280
- Whoa!
- There's no Atari in here!

250
00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.949
That does not mean
you can trash this unit!

251
00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:30.984
[Garret grunts loudly]

252
00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:32.885
I'm up against it, man, I'm...

253
00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.555
[panting]

254
00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:37.357
Oh, no. My store.

255
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.926
My wrists aren't
what they used to be. I just...

256
00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.428
[panting]

257
00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:44.230
I need a win, man. I need...

258
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.567
I need a win.

259
00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.134
When are you gonna stop
looking for treasure

260
00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.036
inside a storage unit...

261
00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:53.540
and recognize
that the real treasure...

262
00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.009
...is inside your heart?

263
00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.012
[sighs deeply]

264
00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:00.813
[Daryl] Let's roll, everyone.

265
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.316
This man has no respect
for the storage community.

266
00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.521
Daryl.

267
00:13:08.321 --> 00:13:11.558
["I Remember You"
by Skid Row playing]

268
00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:12.825
Oh, man.

269
00:13:13.993 --> 00:13:16.462
[chiming softly]

270
00:13:21.602 --> 00:13:23.803
[shouting along with music]

271
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:25.438
[radiator pops]

272
00:13:28.207 --> 00:13:30.109
Oh, no!

273
00:13:31.377 --> 00:13:32.979
Oh, man!

274
00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.481
What the frick?

275
00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:40.053
[screaming]

276
00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:47.060
Look, Chuglass
was not my first choice either,

277
00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.462
but it was Mom's dying wish
for us to live here.

278
00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:52.031
Or at least
that's how I interpreted it.

279
00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:54.167
Yeah, I read something online.

280
00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:55.968
This place sucks.

281
00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.870
Anyways, rent is super low,

282
00:13:57.904 --> 00:13:59.405
and I've got
a full-time gig here,

283
00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:02.075
so it's not really an offer
we can turn down right now.

284
00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.110
[boy] Yeah, I get it.

285
00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.179
Look, I think you're really
gonna like it here.

286
00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:09.616
What's going on with that dude?

287
00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.951
[screaming and sobbing]

288
00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:18.224
[girl] Oh, my gosh, Henry,
we're in Chuglass.

289
00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.959
Say hi to Chuggy the Chip.

290
00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:29.102
[girl] All right.
This is the new neighborhood.

291
00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:30.436
[Henry]
When was this house built?

292
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.640
[laughing]
It's so nice to meet you.

293
00:14:33.674 --> 00:14:35.108
Yeah, nice to meet you.

294
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.210
Uh, your new bosses
sent you this.

295
00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:38.945
Oh...

296
00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:41.914
Yeah, people love working
at the potato chip factory.

297
00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:43.449
Yeah, well, I'm, uh,

298
00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:45.151
I'm running their socials
for a little bit.

299
00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:47.253
I said I'd get
their follower count past 75.

300
00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:49.489
Nice! You must be Henry.

301
00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:51.424
Nice to meet you. I'm Dawn.

302
00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:54.093
Hi. Why is there an alpaca
hanging out of your car?

303
00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:57.330
[Dawn] Well, real estate's
not my only hustle.

304
00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.600
I also do some mobile zoo stuff
on the side.

305
00:14:59.633 --> 00:15:01.535
Anyhoo, I gotta run.

306
00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.202
Call me if you need anything.

307
00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:08.274
Also...
I'm really sorry about your mom.

308
00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.243
It's really brave
what you're doing.

309
00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.377
I hope you know that.

310
00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.046
Thank you.

311
00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:18.985
- [alpaca braying loudly]
- Chill out, man. I'm coming.

312
00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:20.453
Golly!

313
00:15:26.727 --> 00:15:27.661
[sighs]

314
00:15:53.587 --> 00:15:55.455
[Natalie] <i>Henry,
breakfast is ready.</i>

315
00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:58.024
[Henry] I'm coming.

316
00:16:00.561 --> 00:16:01.595
Check it out.

317
00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:06.132
I made you Mom's signature
Tater Tot breakfast pizza.

318
00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:08.635
So you can hand out slices
on your first day.

319
00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:10.637
I thought you wanted me
to seem normal.

320
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:11.705
I do.

321
00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.239
I'm just trying to help you out.

322
00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.642
I got you some body spray.

323
00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:18.010
Signature scents are huge here.

324
00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.012
[Henry] Velvet Mischief?

325
00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.548
You're gonna want to spray it
and then walk into it.

326
00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:23.483
Don't be too direct.
It's really powerful.

327
00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:25.652
- Okay.
- Love you.

328
00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:27.554
Love you, too. [sniffs]

329
00:16:28.287 --> 00:16:30.223
Smells like banana bread
and poo.

330
00:16:42.503 --> 00:16:43.670
[bell chimes]

331
00:16:53.747 --> 00:16:55.081
[exhales]

332
00:17:00.086 --> 00:17:02.421
[orb chiming softly]

333
00:17:02.723 --> 00:17:04.090
[Henry]
Your store's really cool.

334
00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.592
Yeah, I know.

335
00:17:05.626 --> 00:17:07.594
Looking for anything
in particular?

336
00:17:07.628 --> 00:17:09.563
Nah,
just checking some stuff out.

337
00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:12.064
Non-committal.
Classic loser mentality.

338
00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:12.699
I can help.

339
00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:16.302
I'm starting
a mentorship program

340
00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:18.705
for people who want to win
at the game of life.

341
00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:20.841
- Fifty bucks an hour.
- Cool.

342
00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.743
How do you actually win at life?

343
00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:25.612
[scoffs] That's literally
the answer I charge money for.

344
00:17:27.848 --> 00:17:29.415
Tots.
What's with the breakfast pizza?

345
00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:31.217
My sister made it.

346
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.520
I'm supposed to hand out slices
at school to make friends.

347
00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:35.321
A little desperate for day one,
don't you think?

348
00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:38.424
I also notice that
you're wearing Velvet Mischief.

349
00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:40.527
It's a wonderful cologne.

350
00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.161
And I strongly believe
that every young man

351

I applied very much.

Listen, I'm gonna give you
a hot Garbage tip.

355
00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.304
Friendship is like a puzzle.

356
00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:53.239
Sometimes you think you need
lots of pieces to be cool.

357
00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.474
And sometimes
it's just one piece to be cool.

358
00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:57.176
And people will be like,

359
00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.345
"That's not a puzzle,
that's a picture."

360
00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.081
And they have a right to speak,
too.

361
00:18:02.716 --> 00:18:03.884
Any questions?

362
00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.519
Yeah. Quite a few, actually.

363
00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:08.589
Listen, kid. The point is,
there's no "I" in team.

364
00:18:08.622 --> 00:18:10.557
But there are two in winning.

365

Okay, well,

[chuckles] Oh, Henry, we're just
so thrilled to have you.

You know, you're the first
student to enroll here,

372
00:18:31.444 --> 00:18:34.514

about the school rankings.

373

I'm Vice Principal Marlene,

and I'm an open book.

375
00:18:39.452 --> 00:18:41.287
You probably heard
that my husband, Clemente,

376
00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.289
recently divorced me.

377
00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:47.159
And to be honest, I expected it
to hurt more than it does.

378
00:18:47.193 --> 00:18:51.297
You know, the fire went out
on our marriage 20 years ago,

379
00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.767
but we stuck it out
for the dogs.

[teacher] Good morning.

383
00:19:01.273 --> 00:19:02.843
Just a little something
about myself.

384
00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:05.712
I teach gym, I teach art.

385
00:19:05.979 --> 00:19:09.916
Financially,
I'm living in a nightmare, okay?

386
00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:13.219
I wouldn't wish my life
on my worst enemy.

387
00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:15.889
Last year, I claimed
4,000 dollars on my tax return.

388
00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:19.693
So in the summer, I do clams
and oysters down by the airport.

389
00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:22.596
But most of my money is tied up
in a drone kiosk at the mall.

390
00:19:23.964 --> 00:19:26.399
Okay, today we're gonna
do a still life.

391

Don't you know

It's kind of foolproof,
actually. It's just math.

[Garrett] Yep.

531
00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:18.845
We're not in Idaho anymore.

532
00:26:19.179 --> 00:26:21.047
I think this is Wyoming.

533
00:26:21.714 --> 00:26:23.116
Wait, who are you again?

[Garrett] Oooh.

541
00:26:36.096 --> 00:26:37.864
If that's what I think it is,

542
00:26:37.897 --> 00:26:39.232
it could be our first
quest giver.

543
00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:40.900
[retches]

544
00:26:40.934 --> 00:26:42.235

What are you making?

563
00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:27.881
Come closer. It's all right.

564
00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:29.949
Come on. I'm not gonna bite you.

00:27:31.217 --> 00:27:34.320
Oh! How pretty.

567
00:27:34.354 --> 00:27:37.390

find more gold?

569
00:27:38.825 --> 00:27:39.926

Was I unclear when I said

582
00:28:13.193 --> 00:28:16.462
no one was to waste time
on art or leisure?

Dennis?

587
00:28:27.307 --> 00:28:31.911
You stole it from me,
and now you will retrieve it.

588
00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:35.148
It would be a privilege,
my liege.

589

We're going to unbind you now.

590

My piglins will make a meal
of your beautiful wolf.

How do I know
you're telling the truth?

597
00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.970
There's only one way
to find out.

you could ever replace it,

what are you gonna do with it?

You're not gonna sue me,
are you?

813

with my Jeep Grand Cherokee.

- Oh, my.

816
00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.451
How about this? What if I
just take you to dinner?

817
00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.588
Would you like to go to dinner?

818
00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:42.589
Huh.

Oh, these dudes?
They're the villagers.

824
00:39:01.808 --> 00:39:04.443
They're total pacifists
and vegetarians.

825
00:39:04.476 --> 00:39:06.580
You don't bug them,
they won't bug you.

826
00:39:06.613 --> 00:39:09.916
They just like to chill, trade,
and eat buttloads of bread.

827
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.585
They love crushing loaf.

828
00:39:11.618 --> 00:39:12.919
So they built all this?

829
00:39:12.953 --> 00:39:14.486

[Steve] No.

833

That's a legend.

834

dream about here,

Your old dungeon buddy, Steve,

Well, that's a bummer.

The Orb is with four Roundlings.

he has taken them

this Woodland Mansion thing?

Over the mountains,

You know that, right?

some talking to do, buddy.

1241
00:57:10.063 --> 00:57:11.430
Hank and I want some answers.

1242
00:57:11.731 --> 00:57:12.999
Like how are we gonna
stop those pigs?

1243
00:57:13.033 --> 00:57:14.567
And why does my beard
smell like gorgonzola?

1244
00:57:14.601 --> 00:57:15.635
Yeah,
and who's that evil sorceress

1245
00:57:15.669 --> 00:57:17.436
- you were talking about?
- Look!

1246
00:57:17.938 --> 00:57:20.507
The sorceress is a piglin queen
called Malgosha.

1247
00:57:20.540 --> 00:57:21.741
Those are her minions.

1248
00:57:21.775 --> 00:57:23.043
She rules over them

1249
00:57:23.076 --> 00:57:25.078
in a dark hellscape
called the Nether.

1250
00:57:25.745 --> 00:57:27.547
And I always keep
a chunk of gorgonzola

1251
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:29.115
in my front pocket, okay?

1252
00:57:30.083 --> 00:57:30.984

[Steve] <i>It crushed her.</i>

1263
00:58:01.114 --> 00:58:03.850
What'd I tell you
about all that dancing?

1264
00:58:03.883 --> 00:58:05.785
It's time for you to grow up.

1265
00:58:05.819 --> 00:58:08.621
I'm tired of you
chasing your dreams.

1266
00:58:08.655 --> 00:58:11.658
Now, take this axe
and go find some gold.

1267
00:58:11.691 --> 00:58:14.227
That was such
embarrassing dancing!

1268
00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:15.829
[Steve]
<i>So, from that day forward,</i>

1269

1274
00:58:27.941 --> 00:58:29.542
And you were gonna
give it to her?

1275
00:58:29.576 --> 00:58:30.677
Great idea!

1276
00:58:30.877 --> 00:58:32.679
I'm not gonna give it to her.

1277
00:58:32.712 --> 00:58:34.814
But I need that Orb
for leverage.

1278
00:58:34.848 --> 00:58:36.850
I gotta save Dennis.

What do you mean you just
have to put the brain in?

1292
00:59:12.152 --> 00:59:14.721
Well, yes, it's a big deal.
Get it done!

1424
01:05:16.015 --> 01:05:17.316
[Steve] Nice work, Gar-Gar.

1425
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:19.419

almost got us killed.

What's your problem, man?

1428
01:05:23.657 --> 01:05:25.491
We didn't need
those stupid diamonds.

1429
01:05:25.526 --> 01:05:26.693
I swear,
you are literally the most

1430

1431
01:05:28.428 --> 01:05:31.097
Whatever. I need them, okay?

1432
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:32.398
I need the diamonds,

1433
01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:34.467
because I need the money,
because I'm broke.

1434
01:05:35.268 --> 01:05:37.236
You wouldn't know
anything about that.

1435
01:05:39.338 --> 01:05:42.509
My life sucks, kid. All right?
I'm a frickin' loser.

1436
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:44.578
There, I said it.

1437
01:05:45.411 --> 01:05:47.413
I know it looks like I got it
all put together, right?

1438
01:05:47.447 --> 01:05:50.016

01:06:00.426 --> 01:06:01.961
I'm not doing well.

1442
01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:05.364
I'm washed up, Hank,
and I'm gonna lose everything.

1443
01:06:06.533 --> 01:06:08.201
And that's not the worst part.

1444
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.970
I'm alone.

1445
01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:12.639
You weren't alone.

1446
01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.174
I was your friend.

1447
01:06:20.112 --> 01:06:21.648
Sorry about your finances.

1448

[Marlene] <i>Wow.</i>

1450
01:06:30.256 --> 01:06:31.491
I feel like you get me, and
you're an incredible listener.

1451
01:06:31.525 --> 01:06:35.629
And only people with emotional
intelligence are good listeners.

1452
01:06:37.396 --> 01:06:39.633
You know, I just didn't think
it was in the cards

1453
01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:42.034
that I would have another

1454
01:06:42.502 --> 01:06:43.537
Hm.

1455
01:06:44.437 --> 01:06:46.105
I wanna have the guts
to invite you

1456
01:06:46.138 --> 01:06:47.674
over to my house for dessert.

1457
01:06:48.107 --> 01:06:49.743
Huh. Uh-huh.

1458
01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:51.578

No, I think he's Swedish.

1460
01:06:54.146 --> 01:06:55.481
But we're done with our meal.

1461
01:06:57.584 --> 01:07:00.621
There it is.
The Woodland Mansion.

1462
01:07:00.654 --> 01:07:02.623
We're gonna get in there,
get the Earth Crystal

1463
01:07:02.656 --> 01:07:04.357
and get you guys home.

1464
01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:05.559
Follow me!

1465
01:07:06.225 --> 01:07:07.193
Check this out.

1466
01:07:07.828 --> 01:07:09.295
Let's do this.

1467
01:07:09.328 --> 01:07:11.532
Pay close attention
to Papa Steve.

1468
01:07:11.565 --> 01:07:13.767
The Woodland Mansion
has three floors.

1469
01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:17.370
The first floor
is loaded with Vindicators.

1470
01:07:17.671 --> 01:07:19.205
Axe murderers, basically.

1471
01:07:19.238 --> 01:07:20.574
Why is the third floor
on the first floor?

1472
01:07:20.607 --> 01:07:22.308
I'm very confused.

1473
01:07:22.341 --> 01:07:23.744
[Steve] I was trying
to make three floors,

1474
01:07:23.777 --> 01:07:25.679
but I didn't have time to make,
like, a doll house.

1475
01:07:25.879 --> 01:07:29.315
The second floor
crawls with Evokers.

1476
01:07:29.348 --> 01:07:31.450
They wield powerful dark magic.

1477
01:07:31.484 --> 01:07:33.119
This is the worst model
I've ever seen.

1478
01:07:33.152 --> 01:07:34.320
Garrett, stop talking.

1479
01:07:34.353 --> 01:07:35.656
We're trying
to figure out a plan.

1480
01:07:35.689 --> 01:07:37.156
Bro, how long are you
gonna be mad at me for?

1481
01:07:37.189 --> 01:07:38.391
I just got mad at you.

1482
01:07:38.759 --> 01:07:40.293
Please don't be mad at me
for this, okay?

1483
01:07:40.326 --> 01:07:42.361
But I accidentally stole the Orb
while you were crafting.

1484
01:07:44.263 --> 01:07:45.832
Are we cool now?

1485
01:07:45.866 --> 01:07:48.769
You are literally the worst
person in the entire world.

1486
01:07:48.802 --> 01:07:52.438
Guys! Both of you,
eyes on my demonstraysh!

1487
01:07:52.639 --> 01:07:55.374
Third floor houses
the Loot Chamber.

1488
01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:57.343
That's where
the Earth Crystal is,

1489
01:07:57.376 --> 01:07:59.680
but it's guarded by Endermen.

1490
01:07:59.713 --> 01:08:02.381
Whatever you do,
do not look them in the eye.

1491
01:08:02.415 --> 01:08:04.116
They'll fry your brains out.

1492
01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:06.185
Okay, well I could build stairs
to the second floor,

1493
01:08:06.218 --> 01:08:08.254
sneak in through the window,
and snag the Earth Crystal.

1494
01:08:08.287 --> 01:08:10.156
That's a great idea, Hank.

1495
01:08:10.189 --> 01:08:13.060
But to pull it off, we're gonna
need a pretty sweet diversion.

1496
01:08:13.527 --> 01:08:15.428
You know what could work
on these guys?

1497
01:08:15.461 --> 01:08:16.429

[grunting]

1592
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:33.479
Heck yeah. I got you, Gar-Gar.

1593
01:13:33.513 --> 01:13:34.748
- Come on.
- [groans]

1594
01:13:37.651 --> 01:13:40.452
You... You saved my life.

1595
01:13:40.754 --> 01:13:42.088
That's what friends do, Garrett.

1596
01:13:42.122 --> 01:13:43.156
[Henry yelling]

[thud]

1598
01:13:45.025 --> 01:13:46.927
Hank!
Did you get the Earth Crystal?

1599
01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.028
Yeah, I got it.

1600
01:13:48.061 --> 01:13:49.729
Let's get outta this hellhole.

1601
01:13:51.631 --> 01:13:53.667
[all yelling]

1602
01:13:54.034 --> 01:13:55.434

[Henry huffing]

1604
01:13:57.871 --> 01:13:59.739
[roaring]

1605
01:13:59.973 --> 01:14:02.474
[Malgosha] I knew
I'd find you dummies here.

1606
01:14:02.509 --> 01:14:04.110
Oh, no. It's her!

1607
01:14:04.144 --> 01:14:06.478
[Malgosha]
Of course it's me, you fool.

1608
01:14:06.513 --> 01:14:09.816
I've been tracking your scent
from two biomes away.

1609
01:14:10.583 --> 01:14:13.485
Check it out.
I even built me a new Hog.

1610
01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.722
[roaring]

1611
01:14:15.755 --> 01:14:18.992
Malgosha! Your reign is over!

1612
01:14:19.025 --> 01:14:20.627
You're wrong.

1613
01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.162
It's just beginning.

1614
01:14:22.696 --> 01:14:24.030
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

1615
01:14:25.899 --> 01:14:26.800
[Henry] No!

1616
01:14:27.734 --> 01:14:28.702
Hah!

1617
01:14:28.735 --> 01:14:29.803
No!

1618
01:14:29.836 --> 01:14:30.937
Kill them.

1619
01:14:30.971 --> 01:14:32.772
We have work to do.

1620
01:14:33.974 --> 01:14:35.642
Goodbye, Steve!

1621
01:14:35.675 --> 01:14:37.177

- [piglins screeching]
- [Garrett whimpers]

1623
01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:42.949
[Steve] No!

1624
01:14:43.283 --> 01:14:45.484
They're gonna blow
this bridge sky high!

1625
01:14:45.685 --> 01:14:47.120
- Sorry, Hank.
- What?

1626
01:14:48.221 --> 01:14:49.222
[Garrett yells]

1627
01:14:49.255 --> 01:14:50.991
[screaming]

1628
01:14:53.126 --> 01:14:55.595
Yeah! Slime cube.

1629
01:14:57.964 --> 01:15:01.234
[grunts, hollers]

1630
01:15:05.171 --> 01:15:06.573
Come on, Garrett, jump!

1631
01:15:06.606 --> 01:15:07.807
I can't, Steve.

1632
01:15:07.841 --> 01:15:09.109
Get him outta here!

1633
01:15:09.309 --> 01:15:11.711
Go, Hank!
Save your sister and get home!

1634
01:15:11.745 --> 01:15:13.279
Garrett,
you don't have to do this!

1635
01:15:13.313 --> 01:15:15.048
Tell my story in song.

1636
01:15:15.348 --> 01:15:18.718
Keep it metal. Keep it heavy.
Real instruments.

1637
01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:20.820
Besides...

1638
01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:24.924
I love luaus.

1639
01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.261
Spin kick.

1640
01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:31.731
[roaring]

1641
01:15:31.765 --> 01:15:33.299
[high battle cry]

1642
01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:37.170
Garbage toss! Oh, crap!

1643

[Steve shouts]

1644
01:15:39.272 --> 01:15:42.142
[Henry] No!

1645
01:15:42.175 --> 01:15:44.210
[both yelling]

1646
01:15:44.244 --> 01:15:47.280
We're going down!

1647
01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:49.582
Brace for impact!

1648
01:15:49.616 --> 01:15:52.619
[both yelling]

1649
01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:54.854
[grunting]

1650
01:16:03.329 --> 01:16:05.832
[Steve chuckles]

1651
01:16:09.102 --> 01:16:10.637
- Dennis?
- [whines]

1652
01:16:11.104 --> 01:16:13.106
- Dennis!
- [Dawn laughing]

1653
01:16:13.139 --> 01:16:15.108
It's you! It's really you!

1654
01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:17.577
[laughing]

1655
01:16:18.178 --> 01:16:19.279
Gimme...

1656
01:16:19.312 --> 01:16:21.347
[babbling affectionately]

1657
01:16:22.715 --> 01:16:24.084
Oh!

1658
01:16:24.117 --> 01:16:25.752
How'd you find me?

1659
01:16:25.785 --> 01:16:27.120
He's one heck of a wolf.

1660
01:16:27.153 --> 01:16:29.389
He led us right to you guys.

1661
01:16:29.422 --> 01:16:31.925
Now I understand why you kept
yourself so filthy and smelly,

1662
01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:33.226
so Dennis could find you
one day.

1663
01:16:35.061 --> 01:16:36.062
Is he okay?

1664
01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:38.264
He's fine. He's just resting.

1665
01:16:38.298 --> 01:16:39.766
Good.

1666
01:16:39.799 --> 01:16:41.201
It was a pretty rough
crash landing.

1667
01:16:42.335 --> 01:16:43.870
Wait a minute. Where are we?

1668
01:16:45.271 --> 01:16:47.273
- [Dawn laughing]
- Whoa!

1669
01:16:49.442 --> 01:16:52.378
I wish Garbage Man
was here to see this.

1670
01:16:52.412 --> 01:16:54.214
He would've loved
your mushroom hut.

1671
01:16:54.247 --> 01:16:55.882
Yeah, I think so, too.

1672
01:16:59.819 --> 01:17:02.155
[voice shaking]
I was so afraid that I lost you.

1673
01:17:04.691 --> 01:17:06.025
I was so afraid
that I lost you, too.

1674
01:17:08.328 --> 01:17:10.964
I am really sorry
about what I said.

1675
01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:14.634
And I'm really sorry
about Garrett.

1676
01:17:17.871 --> 01:17:19.439
[ghast shrieking]

1677
01:17:19.472 --> 01:17:22.175
[Malgosha]
I'm only gonna say this once.

1678
01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:25.712
This thingy goes
on top of that thingy.

1679
01:17:25.745 --> 01:17:27.280
Got it, Travis?

1680
01:17:27.313 --> 01:17:31.217
It's gonna make a real cool
laser beam that'll darken...

1681
01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:32.719
[shrieking]

1682
01:17:32.752 --> 01:17:34.787
[Malgosha, growls] Never mind.

1683
01:17:40.059 --> 01:17:43.296

[all grumbling, growling]

1687
01:17:59.746 --> 01:18:02.282
[Steve] No. No!

1688
01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:06.819
The Great Darkening! It's begun.

1689
01:18:06.853 --> 01:18:08.855
Malgosha's gathering
all her forces.

1690
01:18:08.888 --> 01:18:10.924
She will destroy this land.

1691
01:18:11.457 --> 01:18:14.360
Unless... we go get that Orb.

1692
01:18:14.394 --> 01:18:16.229
Well, what're we doing here?

1693
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.465
Let's go fight some pigs.

1694
01:18:19.499 --> 01:18:22.001
I'm ready.
I'm done with those pigs.

1695
01:18:22.035 --> 01:18:22.936
Yeah, me too.

1696
01:18:22.969 --> 01:18:25.171
Let's do it for Gar-Gar.

1697
01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:28.007
First we mine, then we craft.

1698
01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:29.742
Let's Minecraft!

1699
01:18:29.776 --> 01:18:32.045
- [grunts] One, two, three.
- Team!

1700
01:18:32.078 --> 01:18:33.746
- Get the Orb!
- Orb! What are you saying?

1701
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.381
- Minecraft.
- We should all say that.

1702
01:18:35.415 --> 01:18:37.750
On three. One...
Forget it. There's no time!

1703
01:18:39.185 --> 01:18:40.521
[Steve]
Show us what you got, Henry.

1704
01:18:40.554 --> 01:18:42.222
[Henry] Okay. I got a plan.

1705
01:18:42.255 --> 01:18:43.790
[Steve] Killer recipes.

1706
01:18:43.823 --> 01:18:44.958
We're gonna have to move fast.

1707
01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:46.326
Let's get to work!

1708
01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.530
[Henry] <i>First we're gonna need
some iron ingots.</i>

1709

[sizzling]

1710
01:18:54.167 --> 01:18:55.902
[grunts] Oh, yeah!

1711
01:18:57.971 --> 01:18:59.138
[Henry]
<i>And the boots of Swiftness.</i>

1712
01:19:01.508 --> 01:19:03.309

<i>Time to light this place up.</i>

1713

- [bones rattling]
- Come on, boys.

1714
01:19:07.347 --> 01:19:09.282
Have a nice flight!

1715
01:19:11.851 --> 01:19:14.187
Yeah, man! Whoo!

1716
01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:17.090
I bet you do. I bet you do!

1717
01:19:17.123 --> 01:19:18.559
[Henry] <i>We're also gonna
need a ton of diamonds.</i>

1719
01:19:23.496 --> 01:19:24.897
[Steve]
Show me what you got, Nat.

1720
01:19:25.865 --> 01:19:27.433
Whoa! Yeah!

1721
01:19:28.569 --> 01:19:29.802
[Natalie] You want some, buddy?

1722
01:19:33.406 --> 01:19:35.041
[excited chatter]

1723
01:19:35.341 --> 01:19:36.309
We're ready.

1724
01:19:36.342 --> 01:19:38.311
Let's go save the Overworld!

[Malgosha cackling]

1727
01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:47.086
All right, my piggies.

1728
01:19:48.988 --> 01:19:53.192
Today,
we take the Overworld as ours!

1729

[all roaring]

1730
01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:56.863
Attack their villages.

1731
01:19:56.896 --> 01:20:00.567
Burn their homes
and their symmetrical farms.

1732
01:20:01.234 --> 01:20:05.471
All they have created,
we destroy!

1733
01:20:05.506 --> 01:20:08.808
[all roaring]

1734
01:20:09.342 --> 01:20:11.612
Well, what are you
standing around for?

1735
01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:12.979
Get out of here!

1736
01:20:13.012 --> 01:20:15.281
Go on, bring me the gold!

1737

Uh?

1742
01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:05.898
Hah! News flash!

1743
01:21:06.132 --> 01:21:08.968
Iron Golems will not attack
unless provoked.

You ready?

1751

Let's do this.

[Natalie grunting]

1753

[Malgosha]
Oh, for goodness' sake!

1754
01:21:57.684 --> 01:22:01.053
Well, what are you doing,
you big block of meat?

1755
01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:03.222
Get down there and take care
of those Roundlings!

[growling]

1761
01:22:21.642 --> 01:22:22.576
Come on!

[hooting laughter]

1763
01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:31.685
[gasps] Huh?

1764
01:22:36.322 --> 01:22:39.125
Okay, Goshe. Let's dance.

1765
01:22:39.325 --> 01:22:40.627
