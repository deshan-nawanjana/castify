00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:05.650
Man, voice-over: Do you know
that feeling when you're doing

2
00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.710
exactly what you were put
on the Earth to do?

3
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.050
The one where it's like
everything inside you

4
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.760
is moving together in harmony
with the universe?

5
00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.540
Different man: Get off!
Get off! Get off!

6
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.580
Get off! Get off! Get off!

7
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.200
Get in formation!

8
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.890
Man, voice-over: No matter
what happens...

9
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:29.460
What the fuck took
you so long, private?

10
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.980
Man, voice-over:
everything will be OK.

11
00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.640
Do not fuck it up
on me, private!

12
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.120
Sweet fucking
baby Jesus!

13
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.330
Man, voice-over: Yeah.

14
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.730
Me neither...

15
00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.560
but, you know,
one can hope, right?

16
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.690
It started when I was a kid.

17
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.170
I always needed to help people.

18
00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.520
Hey! Leave him alone!

19
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.130
Or at least I wanted to...

20
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.090
Unh!

21
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:52.150
so I did what any normal,
red-blooded American would do.

22
00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.660
To our top summer associate.

23
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.710
Man, voice-over:
I became a lawyer.

24
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:02.670
That seemed like a safe move.

25
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.620
You're welcome here
at this firm

26
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.280
anytime you want.

27
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.590
- You're one of us now,
all right?
- Woman: Yeah!

28
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.730
Man, voice-over: But then,
I saw it...

29
00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.420
a life of backyard grilling
and playdates,

30
00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.940
home improvement projects

31
00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.290
and overplanned
tourist adventures,

32
00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.470
neighbors I probably
didn't want to know,

33
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.640
a wife I probably
didn't want to know either,

34
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.730
maybe an affair
with my neighbor.

35
00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.130
The thing was whenever I saw
people like that,

36
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.610
I always thought, "When did you
decide to stop trying?"

37
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.580
So I folded that hand.

38
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.790
Yeah. A year of law school left,
6 figures waiting,

39
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.230
and I enlist
in the fucking army?

40
00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.710
I mean, what the actual fuck?

41
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.850
Everyone thought I was insane.

42
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.630
1, 2, 3!

43
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.500
I thought I was insane.

44
00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.990
The next thing I knew,

45
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.570
I made it through the Q Course
with Special Forces selection.

46
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.170
One minute!

47
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.260
Man, voice-over:
And for the first time

48
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.740
in my entire life...

49
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.090
Let's go surprise
some assholes!

50
00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.910
I was happy.

51
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.260
Whoo! Let's do this!

52
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.760
Saddle up!

53
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.530
Whoo!

54
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.970
I'd found something worth doing

55
00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.500
in a world where things
worth doing

56
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.500
they didn't come around
very often.

57
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.240
I found myself...

58
00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.370
Aah!

59
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:41.910
I found love...

60
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:48.290
Push! Push!

61
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.700
I found family...

62
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.910
Come on! Let's go!

63
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.650
Man, voice-over:
and most of all,

64
00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.450
I found purpose.

65
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.570
Leader: That's our target.
President Venegas.

66
00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:06.590
We're here to take
him out.

67
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.330
See you on the ground!

68
00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:21.940
Huh?

69
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:24.420
No! Shit! Ohh!

70
00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.160
Whoa! Ohh! Huh!

71
00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.990
Ohh!

72
00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.510
Unh!

73
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.510
Oh, fuck! Aw, shit!

74
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.600
Huh!

75
00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.000
No! Ohh! Unh!

76
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.350
Huh!

77
00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:49.920
Guys. Ugh.

78
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.840
Man, voice-over:
And just like that,

79
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.590
my purpose was gone.

80
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.540
I went back to the normal life
that I tried to avoid

81
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.640
and couldn't feel more
like a failure.

82
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.610
Woman: Mason!

83
00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:25.560
Mason!

84
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.010
Casey's gonna be late
for school!

85
00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:39.320
Good morning.

86
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.670
- Hey!
- Hey!

87
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:42.150
Mm-wha!

88
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.280
Ew! Your breath
smells, Daddy.

89
00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.430
Ohh. Got to brush
my teeth.

90
00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.510
OK. You want to drive?
No!

91
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.860
OK. Yeah. In a few years,
it's all yours, though.

92
00:05:57.060 --> 00:05:58.340
All right? You in?
Everything...

93
00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.860
Mason, don't forget
her seatbelt.

94
00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:03.120
Make sure to buckle
your seatbelt.

95
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.340
Please.

96
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.260
Wave to Mommy
because she'll hate me

97
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.230
even more than she
already does
if you don't.

98
00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.750
You know,
how's school going?

99
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.310
Casey: There's a boy
named Chase

100
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.310
that bothers me
all the time.

101
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:21.530
He tries to kiss me
and stuff.

102
00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:23.670
Boy tries to kiss you?
You're 9.

103
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:25.670
- I'm 8, Daddy.
- That makes it even worse.

104
00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.540
Tell you what. The next time
he tries to kiss you,

105
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.930
you hit him
in the throat.

106
00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.110
You know what
the throat is?

107
00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:31.590
I'm not an idiot.

108
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.240
Just hit him
in the Adam's apple.

109
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.500
All boys have them.

110
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.160
Like penises?

111
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.380
Uh, yes. Kind--yes.

112
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.550
Um, just--just hit
him right here, OK?

113
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.340
It'll make it so
he can't breathe
for a little bit.

114
00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.820
Like hitting him
in the penis.

115
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:47.730
Yes, and you know what?
You can do that, also.

116
00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:49.870
All right? OK.
We're here.

117
00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:51.910
Remember your backpack.

118
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.130
Go forth, wreak havoc,
and don't forget
your bookbag.

119
00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.480
Bye, Daddy.

120
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.530
You have
a great day, OK?

121
00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.150
Learn things.

122
00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.100
So I told them...

123
00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:14.240
they can't charge me
those calls.

124
00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.980
I--I--I didn't
make those calls.

125
00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.550
I--I--I don't even know
any of those numbers.

126
00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:20.480
They won't leave me
alone, man.

127
00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.380
So, um--so you want
to hire me

128
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.950
to...argue with your
phone company for you?

129
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.310
Just my old
phone company.

130
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.880
Scott, uh...

131
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.440
you--you have my word
I will make this
all go away.

132
00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:46.010
Oh! Thank you.
Thank--thank you.

133
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.930
Thank you.
Can I give you
a retainer?

134
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:52.190
I'd feel better
with a retainer,
maybe just 500.

135
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:53.540
Like your style, Scott.

136
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.150
Ha! Oh, my gosh.

137
00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.280
Thank you.

138
00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.850
- This--
- There you go.

139
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:00.720
This looks great.
I'll--

140
00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:02.590
- Oh, my gosh.
- I'll be in touch, OK?

141
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.260
OK. Thank you.

142
00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.220
OK.

143
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.470
You don't write,
you don't call.

144
00:08:40.770 --> 00:08:42.630
As I live and breathe.

145
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:44.590
- Sebastian Earle.
- Hey!

146
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:47.680
Aw, man.
Look at you.

147
00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:50.330
God. What are
you doing here?

148
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.730
How'd they get you
in a suit?

149
00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:53.380
I could ask you
the same thing.

150
00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:55.430
Are you kidding?
I'm about to take on

151
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:56.950
a global communications
conglomerate,

152
00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.740
so I got to look
the part.

153
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:02.090
I seem to recall
you saying that
quitting law

154
00:09:02.290 --> 00:09:03.910
was the best decision
you ever made.

155
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.520
- I did.
- And that becoming a lawyer

156
00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:08.090
would only
crush your soul.

157
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.530
Yeah, it has,
but I got a wife and a kid,

158
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.750
and they both require
income, so...

159
00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.970
in lieu of that,
I generate broken dreams
for all involved.

160
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:18.410
Well, do you have
a half-hour to spare
for an old friend?

161
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:20.890
I want to show you
something.

162
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:22.600
I think Lady Justice
can wait.

163
00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.100
Sebastian: So what
do you think?

164
00:09:56.300 --> 00:09:57.400
I think you need
a lawyer.

165
00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.010
- You know a good one?
- Nope.

166
00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:01.580
Carry on, fellas.

167
00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:04.070
Man: Yes, sir. Hey.

168
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:14.330
CDI. Heh heh.
Chicks Dig It.

169
00:10:14.530 --> 00:10:17.600
Actually, Contracted
Defense Initiatives,

170
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.340
but--but, yes, they do.

171
00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.380
You name it,
we got it,

172
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.730
and if we don't,
we'll find it,
buy it, or build it.

173
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.560
We can operate
in any environment

174
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:28.210
and any operational
condition.

175
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.090
We are a one-stop shop
and shoot.

176
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.610
Ranges, mock villages,
our own airstrip,

177
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:36.350
the whole kit.

178
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:38.960
- I opened up 7 years ago.
- Yeah, I remember,

179
00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.360
but honestly,
I never thought
you'd pull it off.

180
00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:43.710
Hey. Good on you, brother.

181
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.410
Well, I started
with the U.S. government,

182
00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.410
then moved to Europe,
then Asia,

183
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.240
then South America.

184
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.760
Now we're over 80%
corporate contracts.

185
00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.110
We're grossing
high 8 figures
this year.

186
00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.420
Heh. Ahh. Private security
work's always been
a bit dicey for me.

187
00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:00.640
It's, like, a thin line
between mercenary work, yeah?

188
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:03.340
Naw. Come on.
It's like any business.

189
00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:04.860
We sell a product.

190
00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.380
That product is
security.

191
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.690
Cavemen out there,
they're your product?

192
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:11.650
They look the part,
and they keep the peace.

193
00:11:11.850 --> 00:11:13.480
Can't hire fast enough.

194
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.480
Tons of ex-military,
a few cops--heh--

195
00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.130
and some good, old
boys with a passion

196
00:11:18.330 --> 00:11:19.740
for the Second Amendment.

197
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:21.090
And steroids.

198
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:22.700
- Don't ask, don't tell.
- Yeah.

199
00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.360
These guys are, uh,
potentially

200
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.710
your new colleagues.

201
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.890
No. No.

202
00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.760
No!

203
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.190
No, no, and no.

204
00:11:35.390 --> 00:11:36.720
Come on.

205
00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.680
I'm too broken down,
I'm--I'm out of shape.

206
00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.460
I'm too old to go running
around the world, Seb.

207
00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.160
I got a life here.

208
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.290
Mason, I know you.
You're--you're miserable.

209
00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:46.730
That's not the point.

210
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:48.470
Look. The truth is
broken or not

211
00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:50.600
you still look
the part.

212
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.470
I'm asking
as a personal favor.

213
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:55.080
I've got an easy
personal protection detail.

214
00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.610
It's a one-off.
Just help me out, huh?

215
00:11:57.810 --> 00:11:59.310
Total milk run.

216
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.740
You guys don't look
like milkmen.

217
00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:17.980
!¡Viva Paldoñia!

218
00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:20.720
Crowd: !¡Viva Paldoñia!

219
00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.460
Everybody is welcome
to Paldoñia.

220
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.380
It's a beautiful country,
beautiful.

221
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.570
Juan Arturo Venegas.

222
00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.610
You kidding me?

223
00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.650
You took a job for the guy
that killed half our team?

224
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:44.260
We were there to kill
him in the first place.

225
00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:46.740
Dude, chill. The job
isn't for Venegas.

226
00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.750
It's body work
for a journalist who's
gonna interview him.

227
00:12:49.950 --> 00:12:51.580
Just show up, be some
window dressing for her,

228
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:53.400
make sure she doesn't
get groped.

229
00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.370
A bunch of our friends died
because of that guy.

230
00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.720
You don't have to
tell me.

231
00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:02.850
I know, and look.

232
00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.890
If he were to get
hit by a bus,

233
00:13:05.090 --> 00:13:07.030
I don't think anybody
would be too upset
about it.

234
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:08.770
Believe me, I'd love
to do it myself,

235
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:10.810
but I'm running
a business,

236
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:12.810
and right now,
that business is
getting a journalist

237
00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:14.420
in and out of Paldoñia.

238
00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.470
Yeah. Send one
of your other guys.

239
00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.390
Heh. I can't spare
them for this.

240
00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:21.170
Listen. I'm trying
to break into

241
00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:23.090
the personal protection
racket for journalists,

242
00:13:23.290 --> 00:13:24.910
and this is
the first step,
so I'm overpaying.

243
00:13:25.110 --> 00:13:27.790
This is me trying to
hook you up, OK?

244
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.180
No drama. Venegas
is sending a plane

245
00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.230
to D.C. tomorrow
to pick you guys up.

246
00:13:33.430 --> 00:13:34.850
I'm not interested.

247
00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.800
20 grand says you are.

248
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.930
Who's the journalist?

249
00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:43.760
Man: This year's recipient

250
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.500
of the International Journalism
and Editors Award

251
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.200
Claire Wellington.

252
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.650
Thank you.

253
00:13:57.220 --> 00:13:59.560
Claire: Journalism
at its best,

254
00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:01.120
it's about the truth.

255
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:02.470
I share this with all
the journalists

256
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.170
who report the facts

257
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.220
and who value the truth
above all.

258
00:14:11.770 --> 00:14:14.440
In my haste to break
a major story,

259
00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:18.400
I neglected...to perform
my due diligence

260
00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.840
in properly fact checking

261
00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.750
and thoroughly vetting
my sources.

262
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:25.150
I have resigned
my position here.

263
00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:31.640
Woman: Make sure that she knows
what she did was wrong.

264
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:45.050
So, uh, how's
everybody doing?

265
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.480
You told your daughter
to hit a boy

266
00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:52.830
in the throat,
and that boy's father

267
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:54.090
- is a lawyer.
- Um...

268
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:56.100
A real lawyer.

269
00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.970
Uh, whatever this is,
it's gone, it's done.

270
00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:03.450
I can't do it
anymore, Mason.

271
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.360
- I can't--
- Jenny, don't overreact.

272
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:07.280
I'm not overreacting.
I think it might be best

273
00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:09.250
for everybody if you
did move out.

274
00:15:14.350 --> 00:15:16.200
Never mind. I'll get Casey,
and I'll go to my mom's.

275
00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.870
No. I'll go.

276
00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:27.660
Hey, Daddy.

277
00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:34.780
What are you doing?

278
00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.350
Building
a cruise ship.

279
00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:41.830
Cruise ship. Wow.
That's a good gig
if you can get it.

280
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:46.360
Ahh. Listen. I got to go
out of town for a few days.

281
00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.230
It's for work.

282
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.230
Do they have snow globes
where you're going?

283
00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:54.020
Tell you what.
If they do, I'll get you one.

284
00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.800
Thanks, Daddy.

285
00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.340
Jenny: What do you mean
you're going out of town
for a few days?

286
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:07.470
- I took a job.
- What?

287
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:08.950
Yeah. Sebastian Earle
hooked me up.

288
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:10.860
- What about your practice?
- Ha!

289
00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.260
You just said a minute ago
that I wasn't a real lawyer.

290
00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.520
What job is this?

291
00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.910
It's private security.
Easy stuff.

292
00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.300
Mason, no.

293
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.050
That part
of your life is over.

294
00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.090
You're not gonna go
and get yourself killed

295
00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:24.830
and leave our daughter
without a father
to raise her.

296
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:26.960
Just let me make
this money, OK?

297
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:28.490
You think I don't know
how unhappy you are

298
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.400
being just a husband
and a father?

299
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:33.450
Imagine what it feels
like to be me,

300
00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:36.230
knowing that I'm
the life you
settled for.

301
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:37.760
Jenny, I--

302
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.070
On second thought,
actually, you should go.

303
00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:42.890
Maybe that's what
you need

304
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:44.650
to fix yourself.

305
00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:11.620
Claire: Politics
in the workplace

306
00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:14.200
and--and the fallout
from that, please.

307
00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.450
No. It's great.
Of course you're being
a weasel about this.

308
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:20.930
I can't say I'm surprised.

309
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.540
Yeah. I wouldn't want to
tarnish your perfect reputation.

310
00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:25.200
You're a saint.
We both know it.

311
00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.650
Excuse me.
Claire Wellington?

312
00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.420
Well, please do,
and I'll be sure

313
00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:34.080
to badmouth you to anyone
who will listen.

314
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:38.300
Hey. That's great.
Yeah. Same to you, asshole.

315
00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.340
Miss Wellington...

316
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:42.780
I'm--I'm, uh--I'm
from CDI.

317
00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.260
I'm Mason Pettits.

318
00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:50.000
You're late.
Where's the car?

319
00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.570
It's, uh, this way.

320
00:17:51.770 --> 00:17:53.460
Great. Can you help me
with this?

321
00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.410
Claire: So you're
my Green Beret.

322
00:18:00.610 --> 00:18:02.710
Army Special Forces.

323
00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:05.240
Right. A Green Beret
is a hat.

324
00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.500
Delta Force isn't
the name of anything
but a bad movie.

325
00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:11.110
I've met my share
of your colleagues.

326
00:18:11.310 --> 00:18:13.070
So where'd you serve?

327
00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.940
Oh. All
the loveliest places.

328
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.420
I was in
the Middle East,

329
00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.080
South America
of course.

330
00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.600
Ooh! North Carolina.

331
00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:25.080
And that tan line
on your ring finger?

332
00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.480
We don't wear
wedding rings
while we work.

333
00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:30.440
Could be a possible
pressure point if
you're captured.

334
00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:33.220
Either that,
or you just got a divorce.

335
00:18:33.420 --> 00:18:35.050
So we're leaving
for Paldoñia.

336
00:18:35.250 --> 00:18:36.920
You know anything
about it?

337
00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:38.310
Sure do.

338
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:41.270
Paldoñia's like
a...Tim Burton movie.

339
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:44.410
It's colorful,
but it's creepy as fuck.

340
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:46.280
That's a new one.

341
00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.930
I have
an exclusive interview

342
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.590
with President
Juan Arturo Venegas.

343
00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.280
He doesn't do interviews.

344
00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.770
Um, with all due respect,
do you understand
at all who--

345
00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:58.900
I think I understand
quite well,

346
00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:00.680
but the real question is
do you understand

347
00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.480
why you're coming along?

348
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.380
My guess is not
to give my opinion

349
00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:08.260
about Juan Arturo Venegas.

350
00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:11.300
Perfect. Then this
will be fine.

351
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.170
I'll focus on Venegas.
You focus on making sure

352
00:19:13.370 --> 00:19:15.890
I don't get robbed
or kidnapped at the hotel.

353
00:19:20.210 --> 00:19:21.440
Man: Pull!

354
00:19:24.780 --> 00:19:26.270
What's up,
what's up?

355
00:19:26.470 --> 00:19:29.450
Welcome back to
"Infamous Daily Live."

356
00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.020
I'm here with
GG Love,

357
00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:33.240
who went
from doing time

358
00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.460
to being
a multimillionaire
entrepreneur

359
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:38.070
and founder of
the Much Loved
clothing brand.

360
00:19:38.270 --> 00:19:39.810
Thanks for
being here, GG.

361
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:41.510
Pleasure's all mines,
baby.

362
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.510
Give us a spin.
Show off what you got.

363
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:47.470
Wow! I can't wait
to get one.

364
00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:48.770
So tell me...

365
00:19:48.970 --> 00:19:50.050
- Have a good laugh?
- Oh, shit!

366
00:19:53.530 --> 00:19:55.260
Was that all
an Internet search
could get you?

367
00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.480
Trust me. There's
far worse out there.

368
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.310
Did you move
to the States
when you were young?

369
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.350
I noticed your
British passport
when we boarded,

370
00:20:01.550 --> 00:20:03.530
and you slipped
your accent, so...

371
00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.230
probably moved here
as a kid.

372
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.270
I mean, if I had
to guess.

373
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:07.850
Nobody's asking
for your guesses.

374
00:20:09.290 --> 00:20:13.100
Why Paldoñia?
Some sort of
image makeover?

375
00:20:13.300 --> 00:20:15.240
This might shock you,
my dear,

376
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.110
but I didn't take
a degree at Oxford

377
00:20:17.310 --> 00:20:20.150
to cover celebrity
bar mitzvahs.

378
00:20:20.350 --> 00:20:22.160
Paldoñia has some
of the largest oil

379
00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:23.850
and natural gas fields
in the world,

380
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.070
and Venegas is
the last pure autocrat

381
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:29.600
in the Western Hemisphere,
and he doesn't do interviews

382
00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:31.180
until now.

383
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:37.000
OK. Just...

384
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.220
just want me to sit
here and shut up then?

385
00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.020
Sounds absolutely
brilliant.

386
00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.390
Miss Wellington,
welcome to Paldoñia!

387
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.580
President Venegas,
so nice to meet...you.

388
00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:27.130
Ellie sends
her regards.

389
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:30.490
Oh, my God.
You are even more beautiful

390
00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.700
in person than
on television.

391
00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:36.580
- Thank you.
- Hoo. Ha ha ha!

392
00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:39.550
It's like that?

393
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.120
Oh. That--
that was a gift.

394
00:21:47.690 --> 00:21:49.420
What? I have a permit
for that.

395
00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:51.680
Before we begin,
we must take a selfie.

396
00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:53.350
Oh. Um...

397
00:21:55.130 --> 00:21:57.640
- Ah. Yes.
- That's--um--

398
00:21:57.840 --> 00:21:59.040
It's a little bright
out here.

399
00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.300
- Yes?
- Oh. Oh!

400
00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:04.080
You approve? Yes.

401
00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:05.350
- Ahh!
- It's great.

402
00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.090
My followers are
gonna love this.

403
00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.280
Use the whole fist?

404
00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:20.840
I bought that one. Yeah.

405
00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:22.540
So Ellie and you
were roommates

406
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.970
in the university,
yes?

407
00:22:24.170 --> 00:22:25.760
Our second
and fourth years, yes.

408
00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:27.800
Hmm. Heh heh.

409
00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.890
Well, any friend
of Ellie's is welcome
in Paldoñia.

410
00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:33.500
Tell me about her.
How is she?

411
00:22:33.700 --> 00:22:35.780
Well, um...

412
00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.990
she is very happy
in Kansas.

413
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:42.600
I know. What's
in Kansas anyway?

414
00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.660
The rich rancher
she married.

415
00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.400
What a pity.

416
00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:48.750
Not in Kansas
anymore, huh?

417
00:22:51.750 --> 00:22:53.440
Was it a bad joke?

418
00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:54.920
Venegas: No.
"The Wizard of Oz."

419
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:56.440
It's one of my
favorite movies.

420
00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.700
I should have
introduced you.

421
00:22:57.900 --> 00:22:59.530
Mason is
my protective detail.

422
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:00.880
Venegas: Of course he is.
Of course.

423
00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.270
Mason Pettits,
CDI's finest,

424
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:06.620
former Army
Special Forces, right?

425
00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.410
Maison Petite.
The little house.

426
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.280
We do our own
research, too.

427
00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:16.330
Ha ha ha! Ha!

428
00:23:16.530 --> 00:23:18.550
Vamanos!

429
00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:56.280
Would you like to ride
my stallion?

430
00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.890
Not now, thanks.

431
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.070
President Venegas,
I really appreciate you

432
00:24:01.270 --> 00:24:02.420
giving me this kind
of access.

433
00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:04.160
Ho ho! Of course.

434
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.550
It's like they say.

435
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:08.900
A blind pig must
use its nose.

436
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.560
Ah. Ha ha.

437
00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.390
There are so many
wonderful things
about my country.

438
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.450
I can't wait for you
to share them with the world.

439
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.350
Look. Mi gente.
My people.

440
00:24:57.050 --> 00:25:01.140
There is a bright future
ahead of us, bright future.

441
00:25:05.930 --> 00:25:08.010
Heh.

442
00:25:08.210 --> 00:25:10.530
Ha ha. Freedom of speech
is very present in Paldoñia,

443
00:25:10.730 --> 00:25:12.230
but let's move on.

444
00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:14.240
Vamos. Vamos.
Adelante. Adelante.

445
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.550
Mason: Just confirming.
We are still headed

446
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:32.340
to your ranch
tonight, right?

447
00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:34.510
Venegas: I am taking you
to my country estate.

448
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:36.350
I think you're
gonna love it.

449
00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:40.000
Let's toast, huh?

450
00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:41.300
- OK.
- Yes.

451
00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:43.780
Ha ha! One for you,

452
00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:47.310
one for me,

453
00:25:47.510 --> 00:25:52.530
and we toast
for your safe travels...

454
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:54.490
and for new friends.

455
00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:55.660
- I like it.
- Yes.

456
00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:57.190
Ah, ah, ah.

457
00:25:57.390 --> 00:25:58.930
- Arriba...
- Arriba...

458
00:25:59.130 --> 00:26:00.410
- abajo...
- abajo...

459
00:26:00.610 --> 00:26:02.060
- al centro...
- al centro...

460
00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.380
- pa' dentro.
- OK. Ha ha ha!

461
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.200
- Ahh.
- Ahem. Heh.

462
00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.240
Uh, if you don't mind,
Mr. President,

463
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.200
I'd love to go over a few
of my interview questions

464
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.290
- with you now.
- Yes, of course.

465
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:17.340
No prepararse
es prepararse para fallar.

466
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.250
Failing to prepare
is preparing to fail?

467
00:26:20.450 --> 00:26:23.880
- Ooh. I love it.
- Ha ha ha!

468
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:33.180
Ha ha ha!

469
00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:34.880
Be ready to fail, huh?

470
00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:36.630
I--ohh!

471
00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:45.710
What are we gonna
do, Mason?

472
00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.950
Mason!

473
00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:58.290
Oh, my God!

474
00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.820
- Aah!
- Stay down!

475
00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.390
- Aah, Mason!
- Get down!

476
00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:08.780
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

477
00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:12.440
No, no, no, no, no!

478
00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.840
Claire: Mason?

479
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:20.540
- What's happening?
- Stay down!

480
00:27:31.470 --> 00:27:34.630
Oh! Ohh!

481
00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.330
Claire: Aah!

482
00:27:40.140 --> 00:27:41.430
What are you doing?

483
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.710
Oh, shit!

484
00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.700
- Get up. Get up.
- What?

485
00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:57.350
Get up. Put your
seatbelts on now.

486
00:27:57.550 --> 00:27:58.670
Oh, God.

487
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:09.720
- Venegas: Unh!
- Claire: Ohh!

488
00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:27.420
Ooh! Ow!

489
00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.780
Claire, are you OK?
Yes? Yes.

490
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.000
Told you this
was mine.

491
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.270
OK, OK.

492
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:42.960
Hey. OK. Stay here.

493
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.540
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

494
00:28:48.910 --> 00:28:50.290
Huh!

495
00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:06.680
Man.

496
00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:08.130
Hey.

497
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:12.790
What part of "stay here"
did you guys not get?

498
00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:37.670
Oh, my back. Ohh.

499
00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:39.410
Oh. Just...

500
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.150
OK. OK.

501
00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:44.980
- Mr. Pettits.
- OK.

502
00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.550
- Thank you very much.
- God! Ohh! My back!

503
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:48.900
- Ahh. My back.
- Are you OK?

504
00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.680
Yeah. Just give me
a second.

505
00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:52.650
Are you sure you're OK?
You want a massage?

506
00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.120
OK.

507
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.560
Claire: What the hell
just happened?

508
00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:58.910
What happened?

509
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.130
Your one-man
security detail happened.

510
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:03.690
He's a hero.

511
00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:05.650
Mason, what's going on?

512
00:30:05.850 --> 00:30:07.040
What's going on?
This place is

513
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:08.390
a shitshow like
it always was.

514
00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.790
We never
should have come.

515
00:30:09.990 --> 00:30:11.270
Let's go.

516
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:13.220
Should we call
for help?

517
00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:15.270
Yeah, but we'll
call when we're
someplace safe.

518
00:30:15.470 --> 00:30:17.660
Ahem. Can you
believe this?

519
00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:18.930
What?

520
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:20.140
C'est un coup d'état.

521
00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:21.490
A coup?

522
00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.540
Putana! Merde!

523
00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.580
I cannot hide
from this!

524
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:29.980
Ha! Hiding seems
like a great idea
right now.

525
00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:33.810
This is not a rebel
assassination attempt.

526
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:36.420
One, really looks
like it is.

527
00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.120
Two, you're screwed
regardless, so...

528
00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:41.430
I have to stop this.

529
00:30:41.630 --> 00:30:42.990
I think I just did.

530
00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:45.950
Stop the overthrow
of my government,

531
00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:48.690
and you will come
with me to the capital

532
00:30:48.890 --> 00:30:50.830
and help me protect
my people.

533
00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.220
Newsflash--your people
just tried to kill you,
all right?

534
00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.350
Count us out.

535
00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.440
Can you hand me my bag?

536
00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.530
- What?
- My bags.

537
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:01.660
We gotta get you out of here
by the end of the day.

538
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:02.750
You're never gonna
need it.

539
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:03.800
I'm with the president
of a country

540
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.150
in the middle
of a coup.

541
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:07.060
This is the scoop
of a lifetime.

542
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.150
You gotta be alive to have
the scoop of a lifetime, OK?

543
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:11.080
You'll break your story
when you're someplace safe.

544
00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:21.380
- What's that?
- A really big gun.

545
00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:22.790
Let's move.

546
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:29.610
Come on.

547
00:31:29.810 --> 00:31:30.920
Ohh!

548
00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.810
Battement tendu.

549
00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:53.820
En pointe.

550
00:31:58.270 --> 00:31:59.820
Yes.

551
00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:03.830
How's it?

552
00:32:06.130 --> 00:32:07.690
Everyone?

553
00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:09.400
Yes. Excellent.

554
00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:13.360
Sorry. Go ahead.

555
00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.220
I see.

556
00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:18.800
Be in touch then.

557
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:26.200
Brava, brava, Marta.
The swan.

558
00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:33.120
Papa has to go
to work my dear.

559
00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:35.380
Encore, encore!

560
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:45.040
Shit.

561
00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:50.820
Wait, wait, Mason.

562
00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:53.690
I c--I can't,
I can't, I can't.

563
00:32:53.890 --> 00:32:57.520
I can't. Ohh.

564
00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:59.650
I guess we're
taking a break.

565
00:32:59.850 --> 00:33:02.350
Ohh.

566
00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:04.960
Are you OK,
Miss Wellington?

567
00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:07.050
- I'm good.
- Oh, good.

568
00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.970
So who's trying
to kill us?

569
00:33:10.170 --> 00:33:12.140
Nobody. Nobody is
trying to kill us.

570
00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:13.770
They're trying to
kill him.

571
00:33:14.810 --> 00:33:17.030
Who wants
to kill you?

572
00:33:17.330 --> 00:33:18.630
Ah.

573
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:21.850
A single insect may bring
down an entire country.

574
00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.070
Which insect wants
to kill you today ?

575
00:33:24.270 --> 00:33:26.390
I don't know,
but I intend to find out.

576
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.120
Oh. You have
a satellite phone.

577
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.430
Who you gonna call?

578
00:33:34.630 --> 00:33:35.960
I'm calling for help.

579
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.520
- Earle.
- Yo. It's Mason. We got hit.

580
00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.480
Shit! What happened?
You OK, Mason?

581
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.910
Heading out of town,
they took out our vehicles.

582
00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.870
I got us out safe,
but I--

583
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:47.660
bro, we're stuck.
I got no idea
where we're at.

584
00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:49.090
Is Wellington safe?

585
00:33:49.290 --> 00:33:50.660
Yeah. She's with me,
and Venegas

586
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.270
is here, too.

587
00:33:52.470 --> 00:33:54.790
What? Why is he
with you?

588
00:33:54.990 --> 00:33:56.100
What about his team?

589
00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.230
Dead. Bro, you got to
get us a ride.

590
00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:00.970
Hang tight.

591
00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:03.020
GPS has your position.

592
00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:06.680
There's a clearing...
3 klicks east.

593
00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.420
Exfil there by helo.

594
00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:09.900
I'm gonna call some
colleagues in the area.

595
00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:11.680
I'll get you picked up.

596
00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:13.610
Heh. So much for a milk run.

597
00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:17.600
- May I use your phone?
- Nope.

598
00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:18.730
But I need to
make a call.

599
00:34:18.930 --> 00:34:20.860
Heh. I don't care.

600
00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.130
- Claire: Mason.
- What?

601
00:34:23.330 --> 00:34:25.090
Tell me why I should do
a favor for him.

602
00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:26.870
Well, for example,
because, uh, I can have

603
00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:29.610
you arrested for
being a foreign spy.

604
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.480
Maybe I pull a coup
of my own then.

605
00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:33.010
Stop it, Mason!

606
00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.010
Singing? Dictators
don't get to sing.

607
00:34:40.210 --> 00:34:42.710
Really? Well, then
go ahead.

608
00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:44.190
Do it, Mr. Pettits.

609
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:45.890
I am not afraid
of death,

610
00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:47.980
and I am not afraid
of people like you.

611
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:49.890
Do it.

612
00:34:52.530 --> 00:34:56.460
Hey, hey!
Put the gun down, please.

613
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:06.080
Knock yourself out.

614
00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.560
Thank you.
Don't worry.

615
00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.130
I'll make it petite.

616
00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:25.320
Hermanos.

617
00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.720
Señor.

618
00:35:27.730 --> 00:35:30.820
- Is this my speech?
- Yes.

619
00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:39.940
Is the lighting okay?

620
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.900
The lighting is perfect, Jefe.

621
00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:44.530
Thank you, General.

Nephew!

Uncle?

00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:04.330
Correct!

I'm walking through the jungle

639
00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.200
with an absolutely lovely woman.

640
00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.160
- The Gringo Journalist?
- Yes !

641
00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:24.090
The beautiful Claire Wellington.

642
00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.420
- Uh-huh.
- Ah!

643
00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.390
Is he asking
what I'm wearing?

644
00:36:36.590 --> 00:36:38.910
No, he's describing
what you're wearing.

645
00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.350
Don't look at me.
He's your friend
of a friend.

646
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:43.700
Yeah. Just didn't
realize he and Ellie

647
00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:45.270
kept in touch still.

648
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:47.710
- What?
- The interview.

649
00:36:47.910 --> 00:36:49.660
That's obviously why
he invited me here.

650
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.750
He invited you?

651
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:53.060
Why? Because I'm not just

652
00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.540
a celebrity news
reporter to you now?

653
00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.980
No. I thought you
landed the interview.

654
00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.670
Ha! Everybody's asked
him for an interview,

655
00:36:59.870 --> 00:37:01.720
but Paldoñia's
been basically
a media blackout

656
00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.900
for the last decade.

657
00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:05.030
Then just like that,
he e-mailed me,

658
00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.590
asked me if I wanted
an interview.

659
00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:07.990
Why do you think
you're here?

660
00:37:08.190 --> 00:37:09.520
I'm not
totally clueless.

661
00:37:10.570 --> 00:37:13.350
Yes, yes,
don't worry. See you soon!

662
00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.000
We were all worried for you.

663
00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.100
Sure. Great. God bless you!

664
00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:26.100
My uncle isn't dead.

665
00:37:28.850 --> 00:37:30.980
Our partners
will not be pleased.

666
00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:45.330
Thank you.

667
00:37:45.530 --> 00:37:46.850
Please tell us you
have good news.

668
00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:48.460
Oh, I have
wonderful news.

669
00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.510
I was just talking
to Jorge, my nephew.

670
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:53.030
He's the one
behind the coup.

671
00:37:53.230 --> 00:37:54.860
That's good news?

672
00:37:55.060 --> 00:37:56.380
Yes, it's great news.

673
00:37:56.580 --> 00:37:59.260
You see, I love my nephew,
but he's an idiot.

674
00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.260
So he--he just told you?

675
00:38:01.460 --> 00:38:02.650
No. he didn't tell
me anything,

676
00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:05.220
but he said
everything. Hmm?

677
00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:07.130
He will not move
a finger if he knows

678
00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:08.660
that I am still alive,

679
00:38:08.860 --> 00:38:11.050
so I told him that
everything was OK

680
00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:13.660
and that we were
gonna go to see him.

681
00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:16.400
You see, you must always
stroke the head

682
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:18.980
that you are
going to cut off.

683
00:38:20.590 --> 00:38:22.190
So is he working
with the rebels?

684
00:38:22.390 --> 00:38:23.670
No, no, no, no.

685
00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.930
The rebels also think
that he's an idiot.

686
00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.940
Heh. Let's go.

687
00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.200
Back to the capital.

688
00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.770
Heh. No.

689
00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:33.680
No.

690
00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.770
Do what you want.

691
00:38:35.970 --> 00:38:37.520
We're getting
out of here.

692
00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.310
We can't just
leave him.

693
00:38:52.510 --> 00:38:53.930
Just did.

694
00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:59.490
I need to report this.

695
00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.400
We can't just let
another government

696
00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.410
in another poor
country get overthrown

697
00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:05.760
in another coup
and nobody pays attention.

698
00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.150
Come on. Don't let
Venegas suck you in.

699
00:39:07.350 --> 00:39:08.670
He's a textbook
sociopath.

700
00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:10.240
He seems OK.

701
00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:11.590
Please.

702
00:39:11.790 --> 00:39:14.330

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:20.470
but I have sacrificed
everything

706
00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:24.340
for my career--my family,
relationships, my life--

707
00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.170
so forgive me
if I refuse to be

708
00:39:26.370 --> 00:39:27.950
the laughingstock who
went from winning a Peabody

709
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:30.350
to covering
celebrity man caves.

710
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:32.310
This is my chance,

711
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:34.760
and it's working out
better than I ever
could have hoped.

712
00:39:36.410 --> 00:39:38.630
Yeah, it's one way
of looking at it.

713
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.980
Err!

714
00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.900
Sebastian.

715
00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.080
Man: Mason Pettits, we got
a call from your boss at CDI.

716
00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.950
Heard you needed a lift.

717
00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:07.430
Yeah, we sure do.

718
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:09.950
Got an ETA
of two minutes for you.

719
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:12.130
Got a spot where I can
set the bird down?

720
00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:13.870
Yeah, we're headed
towards the clearing
right now.

721
00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:16.000
Uh, you got my GPS?

722
00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:17.790
We're heading
straight for it.

723
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:20.240
You can't get
here fast enough.
We'll be standing by.

724
00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.370
OK. Sit tight.
We're getting picked up
in a few minutes.

725
00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.670
Are you sure
we can't stay?

726
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:32.410
Oh, I'm sure.

727
00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:34.240
Get you picked up
across the border.

728
00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.630
You'll find a Starbucks
with free Wi-Fi or something,

729
00:40:35.830 --> 00:40:38.200
break your story
from there.

730
00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.760
Sure sure?

731
00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.690
You can't get
a Peabody if you're dead.

732
00:40:44.520 --> 00:40:46.250
What about Venegas?
You think he'll be OK?

733
00:40:46.450 --> 00:40:48.900
I don't give
a shit about Venegas!

734
00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.750
What is your
deal with him?

735
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:18.160
I can smell
the free Wi-Fi now.

736
00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.770
Not good.

737
00:41:25.970 --> 00:41:28.130
- Run! Run!
- What?!

738
00:41:58.030 --> 00:42:01.380
Aah!

739
00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.780
Claire: Aah!

740
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:18.830
- Agh!
- Aah! Aah!

741
00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.040
Aah! Aah!

742
00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.530
Come on!

743
00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.720
Oh, God!

744
00:42:35.110 --> 00:42:36.880
Come on.

745
00:42:37.080 --> 00:42:38.060
Are you kidding me?

746
00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:40.110
Embrace the suck!

747
00:43:06.490 --> 00:43:07.970
Aah! Ohh! Ohh!

748
00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:10.840
Claire: Aah!

749
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.400
Still excited
to cover a coup?

750
00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:18.460
- Less and less honestly.
- Yeah.

751
00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:57.150
Shit! he's going
for another round.

752
00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:03.070
Stay put.

753
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:49.770
Tell me you got that.

754
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:55.250
Run!

755
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:24.060
Mason?

756
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:38.510
Mason?

757
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.590
Mason?

758
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:23.470
Oh. Not Mason.

759
00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.560
Because hiding in a tree
is such a good idea.

760
00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.010
Huh!

761
00:47:21.050 --> 00:47:22.250
Are you OK?

762
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:23.880
Yeah. I'm good.

763
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:27.560
Do you need help?

764
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:28.970
Enn.

765
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:46.990
Claire: Ooh!

766
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.480
You good? Ugh.

767
00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.430
Suddenly, I'm very glad
I paid you to tag along.

768
00:48:08.370 --> 00:48:09.870
Mason!

769
00:48:10.070 --> 00:48:11.180
- Unh!
- Aah!

770
00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:14.520
Where is Venegas?

771
00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:17.190
Aah!

772
00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.750
I'm here.

773
00:48:23.950 --> 00:48:25.840
Ohh!

774
00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:27.490
Aah!

775
00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:28.900
Puta!

776
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:34.540
Oh. Miss Wellington,
I am--I am so sorry

777
00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:36.890
for the mess
that I have made.

778
00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:38.520
Thank you.

779
00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.900
Where did you
come from?

780
00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.690
From behind that tree.

781
00:48:45.130 --> 00:48:47.030
Not literally.

782
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:48.830
What's up
with the hand cannon?

783
00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:52.650
- Juanita?
- Yeah.

784
00:48:52.850 --> 00:48:54.430
What kind of egomaniacal
psycho dictator

785
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:57.490
would Venegas be if he
didn't have a big gun?

786
00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:01.280
Point taken.

787
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.070
Thank you
for your help.

788
00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.510
You're welcome, Mr. Pettits.

789
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:41.140
Jorge: Colonel Koehorst.

790
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.660
General Vásquez,

791
00:49:50.860 --> 00:49:52.530
my clients are very
disappointed that

792
00:49:52.730 --> 00:49:55.410
your uncle is still alive
and causing trouble.

793
00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:57.760
It would appear that
your men likewise

794
00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:59.540
failed to kill
my uncle.

795
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:02.980
Certainly our
arrangement's off
to a shaky start.

796
00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.030
My clients need
assurance that

797
00:50:06.230 --> 00:50:09.690
their investment in
your country remains secure.

798
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.520
Is that clear?

799
00:50:17.700 --> 00:50:20.340
Yes. Ahem.

800
00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.870
Good.

801
00:50:22.070 --> 00:50:23.520
Thank you.

802
00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.100
Better one man dies
instead of a thousand.

803
00:50:51.390 --> 00:50:53.430
Ahem.

804
00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:58.180
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

805
00:51:01.960 --> 00:51:03.490
Ahh.

806
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:12.090
Well, this is
just...awesome.

807
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:13.370
Yeah.

808
00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:19.360
So how'd you get
wounded?

809
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.380
Your back. Saw you've
been favoring it.

810
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:26.890
God, I'm sorry
for trying to have

811
00:51:27.090 --> 00:51:28.800
a human moment with you
in the middle of a jungle

812
00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.120
where we could die
at any second.

813
00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.520
Mission I was on
went sideways
a while back.

814
00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.950
I got injured.
My back hurts.

815
00:51:45.150 --> 00:51:46.950
Did that happen here?

816
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:48.360
Yeah.

817
00:51:49.750 --> 00:51:51.620
It was my last mission.

818
00:51:55.020 --> 00:51:58.880
And so you're married...
or were married?

819
00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:01.180
I didn't quite follow
with the ring thing.

820
00:52:01.380 --> 00:52:04.100
Heh.

821
00:52:06.170 --> 00:52:07.290
Yes.

822
00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:10.710
Probably separated
by now.

823
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:13.070
Hmm.

824
00:52:13.270 --> 00:52:14.590
I was just way better
at being an operator

825
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:17.430
than I am at normal,
day-to-day life.

826
00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.810
Then I got hurt,
then I got out,

827
00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:23.510
and then
I just sucked.

828
00:52:23.710 --> 00:52:26.030
I got low.

829
00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.950
Took me years to
figure out how
to become a lawyer.

830
00:52:31.150 --> 00:52:32.520
Wait. You're a lawyer?

831
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.040
Yeah. Officially.

832
00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.220
Passed the Bar,
whole 9.

833
00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:37.390
Ha!

834
00:52:37.590 --> 00:52:39.130
Thought it would make
me feel more normal.

835
00:52:39.330 --> 00:52:40.790
Mmm.

836
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:44.050
Turns out it just made me
hate myself more.

837
00:52:44.250 --> 00:52:46.660
So you got into
private security?

838
00:52:46.860 --> 00:52:48.060
Yeah.

839
00:52:48.260 --> 00:52:50.100
How long you been
doing that now?

840
00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:53.450
Uh, it's what, 5...

841
00:52:53.650 --> 00:52:55.760
4...3 days?

842
00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.550
What? CDI said
you were their best.

843
00:52:59.750 --> 00:53:01.370
You saw me take out
a helicopter.

844
00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:04.680
I mean, I think you
got your money's
worth, right?

845
00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:06.860
I mean, come on.
That was--

846
00:53:07.060 --> 00:53:08.660
that was pretty cool.

847
00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.700
That was pretty
damn cool.

848
00:53:33.290 --> 00:53:35.320
Uh, we should go around.

849
00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.840
How rude would
that be?

850
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:38.190
It probably isn't safe.

851
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:39.850
It's very safe.

852
00:53:40.050 --> 00:53:42.760
Welcome to Sabrina,
my home.

853
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:49.860
Heh heh.

854
00:53:56.310 --> 00:53:58.360
- Ahh. Ha!
- Ha ha ha!

855
00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:04.220
Claire, Mason,

856
00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:06.480
this is my oldest friend
Ernesto Sandoval.

857
00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.010
He is the leader
of this village.

858
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:11.110
It's an honor.

859
00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:18.290
Oh! Oh!

860
00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.640
You're much more
beautiful than on TV.

861
00:54:26.210 --> 00:54:27.260
The Hulk.

862
00:54:27.730 --> 00:54:29.240
The Hulk scares me.

863
00:54:33.450 --> 00:54:34.600
What did he say?

864
00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:35.600
Something funny,
I guess.

865
00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.170
Venegas: This is Pepino.

866
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:38.650
He is the, the son-in-law
of the chief.

867
00:54:38.850 --> 00:54:40.600
He will give us a ride
into town tomorrow.

868
00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.430
- Tomorrow?
- Yes, Mason.

869
00:54:42.630 --> 00:54:43.910
Nobody travels
in this region

870
00:54:44.110 --> 00:54:45.260
of the country
at night.

871
00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.440
Not even mercenaries.

872
00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:47.960
Consider it a chance
to rest

873
00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.090
and wash off the blood.

874
00:54:50.290 --> 00:54:51.310
OK.

875
00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:54.440
Uh...

876
00:55:09.470 --> 00:55:10.680
- Ohh!
- Oh, my God!

877
00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.110
Ha ha ha!

878
00:55:12.310 --> 00:55:12.980
- I just--
- I didn't--

879
00:55:13.180 --> 00:55:14.070
didn't see anything.

880
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:15.680
Venegas: Whew!

881
00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:18.210
Oh. Hoo!

882
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:20.400
Nice ink, woman.

883
00:55:23.010 --> 00:55:26.170
Color me impressed,
Mr. Pettits.

884
00:55:26.370 --> 00:55:28.320
Not petite at all.

885
00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.740
Shall we do
the interview?

886
00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:33.370
Huh?

887
00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:49.590
Mason: So what do you want
me to do again?

888
00:55:49.790 --> 00:55:52.850
Just a standard
two-shot.

889
00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:56.420
Didn't exactly learn
that in basic training.

890
00:55:56.620 --> 00:56:00.200
Just make sure we're
both in the frame.

891
00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.870
- Shall we begin?
- Please.

892
00:56:06.440 --> 00:56:07.730
OK. Let me just...

893
00:56:07.930 --> 00:56:09.340
Claire:
We're rolling?

894
00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:11.750
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

895
00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:17.180
President Venegas,
thank you for
speaking to me

896
00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:20.570
about the events that
have transpired over
the past 12 hours.

897
00:56:20.770 --> 00:56:22.140
Venegas: I truly appreciate
the opportunity

898
00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.050
of speaking with you.

899
00:56:24.250 --> 00:56:25.930
The world will soon
learn that earlier

900
00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:27.710
this morning you survived
an assassination attempt

901
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:28.890
that resulted
in the deaths

902
00:56:29.090 --> 00:56:31.370
of your entire
security team.

903
00:56:31.570 --> 00:56:33.330
Sadly, yes.

904
00:56:33.530 --> 00:56:36.890
Who do you think
is behind this
attempted coup?

905
00:56:37.090 --> 00:56:39.290
Our land and its mineral
resources have been exploited

906
00:56:39.490 --> 00:56:41.990
by outsiders
for a very long time,

907
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:43.600
and it is no secret
that these outsiders

908
00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:46.730
have propped up
my presidency for many years

909
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:49.250
while I turned
my back on my people.

910
00:56:49.450 --> 00:56:52.000
The CIA, the SAS,
they're only a tool

911
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:55.040
to influence leaders
like me in countries
like mine,

912
00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.870
but the real power has
always been in the hands

913
00:56:57.070 --> 00:57:00.180
of CEOs and shareholders
that make billions

914
00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.270
out of our natural resources
on the back of my people.

915
00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:07.010
So the corporations
were behind the attempt
on your life?

916
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.140
I was with you.
The attackers seemed like

917
00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:11.100
professional soldiers.

918
00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:13.630
What can't these
people buy, Claire?

919
00:57:13.830 --> 00:57:16.500
You think
an assassination
attempt is scary?

920
00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.670
Try telling the CEO
of a global energy company

921
00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:21.070
to go fuck his mother
and watch your currency drop

922
00:57:21.270 --> 00:57:24.720
70% by the end
of the conference call.

923
00:57:24.920 --> 00:57:28.090
Paldoñia has been blessed
with a second chance.

924
00:57:30.440 --> 00:57:33.950
In my fists are
lanthanides,

925
00:57:34.150 --> 00:57:36.430
rare earth metals that
are the core component

926
00:57:36.630 --> 00:57:39.740
for every new technology,
cell phones, tablets,

927
00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.920
electric cars,
MRI machines.

928
00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:43.570
These corporations,
they want to exploit

929
00:57:43.770 --> 00:57:45.880
our new resource by
a pittance of what it's worth,

930
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:48.400
and I have told them
that I will not allow it,

931
00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.880
which is why they're
trying to kill me.

932
00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.060
Paldoñia will become
the number one provider

933
00:57:53.260 --> 00:57:56.510
of the world's
most precious metal.

934
00:57:56.770 --> 00:57:59.150
My promise,
and my legacy

935
00:57:59.350 --> 00:58:01.630
is that wealth from these metals

936
00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:04.150
will be invested solely
and exclusively

937
00:58:04.350 --> 00:58:07.200
to enrich the people
of Paldonia.

938
00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:08.640
Long Live Paldonia!

939
00:58:15.610 --> 00:58:18.040
Quite a puff
piece you got here.

940
00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:19.440
Yeah.

941
00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:27.790
Venegas: The bridge.
Here they come.

942
00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:29.270
Do you remember that?

943
00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:32.180
You come back.
Ba ba ba ba! Take that!

944
00:58:40.380 --> 00:58:41.800
Right?

945
00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.460
I'm telling you.

946
00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:45.980
- You saved my life.
- Claire: Yes.

947
00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:47.690
Very impressive.

948
00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.430
Whoo!

949
00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:04.690
Más, más.

950
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:31.210
Bravo! Bravo!

951
00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:56.270
Y-you don't have to sleep
in a chair, Mason.

952
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:58.020
I've slept in worse.

953
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:06.330
Want to play a game to
see who gets the bed?

954
01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:12.150
OK. If you know
what this is,

955
01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:14.550
I'm gonna be
in trouble.

956
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:19.030
That's a mandala.

957
01:00:19.230 --> 01:00:22.030
I'm guessing you got it
in India,

958
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:23.520
work trip.

959
01:00:24.830 --> 01:00:28.120
Ha. OK.

960
01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:30.340
OK.

961
01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:34.780
This is Latin.

962
01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:38.090
"She flies
with her own wings."

963
01:00:38.290 --> 01:00:39.790
That's Latin?
It, um--

964
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:41.530
ahem--it's cool.

965
01:00:41.730 --> 01:00:43.530
Yeah. I got it
a few years ago

966
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:46.530
as a reminder
that everything's
gonna work out fine.

967
01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:49.710
And why would you need
that reminder,

968
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:52.410
aside from being here
with an inexperienced
bodyguard

969
01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:53.980
and being hunted
by mercenaries?

970
01:00:54.180 --> 01:00:57.020
Oh. Ttt, ttt, tt.

971
01:00:57.220 --> 01:00:58.470
Stop.

972
01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:02.940
Um...heh.

973
01:01:03.140 --> 01:01:04.740
Can you see that?

974
01:01:06.130 --> 01:01:08.120
Yep. Uh, anarchy?

975
01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.170
What, do you not
believe in any form
of government?

976
01:01:11.370 --> 01:01:14.560
I didn't when
I was a teenager.

977
01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.350
I was very rebellious.

978
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:18.700
I can buy that.

979
01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:20.920
Hmm. It got me
into journalism,

980
01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:24.010
you know,
confronting power,

981
01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:27.920
fighting governments
to get to the truth.

982
01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:30.580
What's not to love?

983
01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.100
Yeah, yeah.
Of course.

984
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.800
So whatever you thought,

985
01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.540
I came here
for the chance

986
01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:37.020
to confront
a dictator

987
01:01:37.220 --> 01:01:38.540
and hold power
to account.

988
01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:39.850
That's why
I came here.

989
01:01:40.050 --> 01:01:43.030
Not for my career.

990
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:45.510
Maybe a little bit
for my career.

991
01:01:45.710 --> 01:01:47.680
Heh.

992
01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:49.740
Now, you tell
me something.

993
01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:53.750
Good night.

994
01:01:58.230 --> 01:02:00.260
Are you enjoying this?

995
01:02:00.460 --> 01:02:03.180
I'm just doing my job.

996
01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.760
Yeah. Me, too.

997
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:09.500
I c--I can't.
Ahem. I can't.

998
01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:15.800
You still love her.

999
01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.380
Yeah.

1000
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:25.810
Timing, right?

1001
01:02:26.010 --> 01:02:28.650
- Yeah. The worst.
- Ha ha ha!

1002
01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:33.260
Good night, Mr. Pettits.

1003
01:02:35.830 --> 01:02:37.570
Good night,
Miss Wellington.

1004
01:02:57.940 --> 01:02:59.670
Morning.

1005
01:02:59.870 --> 01:03:02.240
Yo. We got to go.

1006
01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:03.950
Heh.

1007
01:03:06.210 --> 01:03:08.150
Aww. You're still
not gonna let me go

1008
01:03:08.350 --> 01:03:10.720
to Puerto Santiago
to tell this story, huh?

1009
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:12.850
That's a negative.
You got your exclusive.

1010
01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.990
We get you to safety,
you break your story.

1011
01:03:16.190 --> 01:03:18.250
Do you think I have
enough of a story?

1012
01:03:18.450 --> 01:03:21.780
I mean, yes, I have
Venegas telling his side,

1013
01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:24.130
but it could
still be dismissed
as the rantings

1014
01:03:24.330 --> 01:03:26.130
of a dictator
trying to explain away

1015
01:03:26.330 --> 01:03:27.480
a popular revolt.

1016
01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:28.840
That is true.

1017
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:32.530
The world has always
been largely apathetic

1018
01:03:32.730 --> 01:03:34.270
towards my country.

1019
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:38.230
That has served many well
but not my people.

1020
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.970
That is why today I am
going to Puerto Santiago

1021
01:03:41.170 --> 01:03:42.800
for the future
of my people.

1022
01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:44.710
Very inspiring.
I'm just gonna move

1023
01:03:44.910 --> 01:03:46.670
the delusions of saving
your people to the back burner

1024
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:49.380
and not getting us killed
to the front burner.

1025
01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.940
Why are you here, Mason?

1026
01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:54.850
- What?
- Yes.

1027
01:03:55.050 --> 01:03:57.860
Why are you here
in Paldoñia?

1028
01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.470
For her.
To protect her.

1029
01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:02.080
Really? That's why you
think you're here?

1030
01:04:02.280 --> 01:04:03.950
Hmm. For such
a cynical man,

1031
01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.950
you are hopelessly
naive, Mason.

1032
01:04:07.150 --> 01:04:12.230
Out of all places,
you were sent here.

1033
01:04:14.410 --> 01:04:16.500
The question
is why, Mason.

1034
01:04:43.780 --> 01:04:45.160
Mason:
Yo. It's Mason.

1035
01:04:45.360 --> 01:04:47.300
Mace. Are you OK?
I'm freaking out here.

1036
01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:48.910
Yeah. What's the story, bro?

1037
01:04:49.110 --> 01:04:50.650
You sent me down here
because you thought
I'd roll over?

1038
01:04:50.850 --> 01:04:52.690
Maybe I was too big
of a mess to handle it?

1039
01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.300
Because I, like, owned
a bunch of these dudes.

1040
01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.390
- What are you talking about?
- Come on, man.

1041
01:04:56.590 --> 01:04:58.390
You really gonna try
to convince me you sent me

1042
01:04:58.590 --> 01:05:00.880
down here randomly
to meet the guy who
killed half our friends,

1043
01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:02.310
and then the day I get
here, by coincidence,

1044
01:05:02.510 --> 01:05:03.880
there's a coup with a bunch
of South Africans?

1045
01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:05.710
It should be great.

1046
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:07.930
Mace, it's not what
you think, all right?

1047
01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:09.540
Just breathe.

1048
01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.060
- I love you like a brother.
- Yeah?

1049
01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.410
The only thing I can't
figure out is why you
needed me down here.

1050
01:05:16.050 --> 01:05:19.420
They wanted you
to dispose of him.

1051
01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:20.720
Kill Venegas?

1052
01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.550
At his ranch.

1053
01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:24.550
One of his bodyguards
was gonna get you a gun,

1054
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.120
sneak you
into his bedroom.

1055
01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:27.640
Yeah, but why me?

1056
01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:29.380
I thought it'd be a gift
to take out the guy

1057
01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:30.820
who killed our brothers,

1058
01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:32.820
but apparently
his nephew thought Venegas

1059
01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:35.260
was hip to it,
and he jumped the gun.

1060
01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:36.650
I never would've sent
you down there

1061
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:38.830
if I thought there was
gonna be a coup.

1062
01:05:39.030 --> 01:05:40.920
Seb, what kind of
insanity have you
gotten yourself into?

1063
01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.480
Look. Security contracting,

1064
01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:47.050
you deal with
some shady people.

1065
01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:48.580
Some of it
rubs off on you.

1066
01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:50.360
Who are these people?
Who paid you?

1067
01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.670
The South Africans
are contractors, too.

1068
01:05:52.870 --> 01:05:55.890
They approached me
when the Wellington
interview happened.

1069
01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:58.190
They--they--they rep
people who want to
take control of the--

1070
01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:00.630
- The lanthanides.
- Right.

1071
01:06:00.830 --> 01:06:02.500
Mace, there's
an easy fix here.

1072
01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.200
Put a bullet in Venegas.

1073
01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:05.550
Do it for
the guys we lost.

1074
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.380
Do it for his country.

1075
01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.780
Do it
for the world.

1076
01:06:10.220 --> 01:06:13.440
Mace? Ma--

1077
01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:30.750
Hello?

1078
01:06:30.950 --> 01:06:31.790
Mason: Honey?

1079
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.970
Hi, Daddy.

1080
01:06:33.170 --> 01:06:35.540
Hey. Uh...

1081
01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:38.410
hey. I, um--I just
wanted to tell you

1082
01:06:38.610 --> 01:06:39.890
that I love you
and Mommy so much.

1083
01:06:40.090 --> 01:06:41.980
I love you too, Daddy.

1084
01:06:42.180 --> 01:06:43.800
Daddy, Mommy is sad.

1085
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.110
You should come home.

1086
01:06:46.310 --> 01:06:47.590
Yeah. Yeah.

1087
01:06:47.790 --> 01:06:48.850
I--I promise I'll
be home soon.

1088
01:06:49.050 --> 01:06:50.250
Hey. Is--is Mommy there?

1089
01:06:50.450 --> 01:06:51.730
Can you put Mom on
the phone right now?

1090
01:06:51.930 --> 01:06:54.600
OK, but she told Grandma
that she doesn't

1091
01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:56.380
want to talk to you
again until you get

1092
01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:57.770
your shit together.

1093
01:06:57.970 --> 01:06:59.990
Heh. Ahem.

1094
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.000
Just put mom
on the phone, sweetheart.

1095
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.650
Mommy! Daddy's
on the phone.

1096
01:07:04.850 --> 01:07:05.570
OK, honey.
You go get ready.

1097
01:07:05.770 --> 01:07:07.010
OK.

1098
01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.660
- Mason?
- Hey.

1099
01:07:10.860 --> 01:07:12.140
Where are you?

1100
01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:13.920
I'm just in a shop
getting Casey something.

1101
01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.020
Listen. Um...

1102
01:07:18.630 --> 01:07:22.060
I just wanted to
say thank you

1103
01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:23.500
for sticking with me
through all this

1104
01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.930
and that I love
you very much.

1105
01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:28.890
Oh. OK. I mean,
you're kind of
scaring me,

1106
01:07:29.090 --> 01:07:30.200
- uh, with that.
- No, no.

1107
01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.640
It's, it's--don't worry.
Don't worry.

1108
01:07:32.840 --> 01:07:34.200
I love you.

1109
01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.900
I--I love you,
too, so much.

1110
01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:43.430
Please just come
home in one piece.

1111
01:07:43.630 --> 01:07:45.840
- I'm on my way.
- OK.

1112
01:07:50.620 --> 01:07:52.320
Thank God for that.

1113
01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:07.060
Venegas: So as you
walk to this--

1114
01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.280
Claire: All right. I'll use
some of the skirt. Yes.

1115
01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.670
You walk into
position right here,

1116
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:12.980
and then you go like

1117
01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:15.200
Mason?

1118
01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.810
Hey.

1119
01:08:17.010 --> 01:08:18.290
We're heading
for the border tonight.

1120
01:08:18.490 --> 01:08:19.640
- What?
- What?

1121
01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.770
We're leaving,
and that's that.

1122
01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:21.990
- No, no. Wait.
- Hey!

1123
01:08:22.190 --> 01:08:23.990
Don't give me a reason.

1124
01:08:27.620 --> 01:08:29.140
Claire: Ohh!

1125
01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:49.460
Where's Venegas?

1126
01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:57.120
Venegas!

1127
01:08:58.040 --> 01:08:59.680
Venegas!

1128
01:08:59.880 --> 01:09:01.160
Mason: Dude, stop
following us already.

1129
01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:02.600
Venegas: I could say
the same thing to you,

1130
01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:03.940
but I have much
better manners.

1131
01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.920
Mi amigo has a car.
Come on!

1132
01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:07.300
I said,

1133
01:09:07.500 --> 01:09:10.010
Where is President Venegas?

1134
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:14.780
I said,

1135
01:09:14.980 --> 01:09:17.060
Where is President Venegas?

1136
01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:20.190
Nesto Sandoval.

1137
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.720
Where is President Venegas?

1138
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:41.330
This is your car?

1139
01:09:41.530 --> 01:09:43.510
Sí señor.

1140
01:09:43.710 --> 01:09:45.160
Claire: It doesn't
look very fast.

1141
01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.910
What are we gonna
do with this thing?

1142
01:09:53.190 --> 01:09:54.210
Where's Venegas?

1143
01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:07.440
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

1144
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:08.880
Let him go.

1145
01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.400
It's the only way
out of this.

1146
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:12.270
If they kill him here,
they kill every person

1147
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:14.450
in this village.

1148
01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.810
I hate you.

1149
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:26.430
Hey!

1150
01:10:29.220 --> 01:10:31.770
You're looking
for Venegas?

1151
01:10:31.970 --> 01:10:34.300
Here is Venegas!

1152
01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.470
- Um...
- Can you ride?

1153
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:38.650
I'll manage.

1154
01:10:38.850 --> 01:10:39.780
All right.

1155
01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.660
OK. Hold on.

1156
01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.480
Huh! Ohh!

1157
01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:51.060
- OK.
- Oh.

1158
01:10:57.590 --> 01:10:58.620
- Ohh!
- Get on.

1159
01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.230
- What?!
- Get on!

1160
01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:01.760
No, no! I am very
afraid of horses.

1161
01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.410
Half of your pictures
are on horses.

1162
01:11:03.610 --> 01:11:06.630
- It was Photoshopped.
- Err!

1163
01:11:07.700 --> 01:11:10.070
Ohh! OK. OK.

1164
01:11:10.270 --> 01:11:12.380
Let's go!

1165
01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.860
Aah! Aah!

1166
01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:19.650
OK. OK. Oh! OK.

1167
01:11:19.850 --> 01:11:22.560
Ooh! Oh! Aah!

1168
01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.480
- Aah!
- Mason: Claire, come on!

1169
01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.710
Oh, God! Oh, God!

1170
01:11:39.910 --> 01:11:41.450
Venegas: Aah! Aah!

1171
01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:42.930
Hold onto my waist!

1172
01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:45.060
Ohh! Aah!

1173
01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:47.020
This isn't weird at all.

1174
01:11:47.220 --> 01:11:50.940
Let's go!
Get them!

1175
01:11:59.050 --> 01:12:00.730
Hang tight!

1176
01:12:00.930 --> 01:12:02.510
Claire, this way!

1177
01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:04.120
Claire: Wait, wait, wait!

1178
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:17.050
Mason:
Claire, follow me!

1179
01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.850
Aah!

1180
01:12:25.550 --> 01:12:27.320
- Aah!
- Hang on!

1181
01:12:35.210 --> 01:12:36.590
Stay there.
Stay there.

1182
01:12:36.790 --> 01:12:38.810
Do not move.

1183
01:12:39.010 --> 01:12:42.030
Get up.
Come here. Come here.

1184
01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:43.600
Stay still.

1185
01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.400
Hello, Miss Wellington.

1186
01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:49.490
May I call you Claire?

1187
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:52.910
Where's Claire?

1188
01:12:53.110 --> 01:12:54.710
She was right
behind us.

1189
01:12:57.410 --> 01:12:58.580
Oh.

1190
01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:02.570
Don't worry.

1191
01:13:02.770 --> 01:13:06.400
They won't hurt her
if I'm still alive.

1192
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.140
Looks like I'm going
to Puerto Santiago.

1193
01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:09.890
Excellent!

1194
01:13:10.090 --> 01:13:14.770
Aah! What?!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1195
01:13:19.430 --> 01:13:21.550
So you take money
to make private wars?

1196
01:13:21.750 --> 01:13:23.160
What's that like?

1197
01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:25.640
Why don't you ask
your Green Beret?

1198
01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:28.380
I would, but I seem
to have been kidnapped
by mercenaries.

1199
01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.820
Sweetheart,
we just saved you
from the worst dictator

1200
01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:33.470
this continent
has ever seen.

1201
01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:35.430
I guess I missed
the chivalry while you were

1202
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:36.650
shooting at me.

1203
01:13:36.850 --> 01:13:39.000
We were shooting at him.

1204
01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.740
Our group has been
contracted on behalf

1205
01:13:40.940 --> 01:13:43.700
of the people
of Paldoñia.

1206
01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:45.310
You mean,
a corporate-backed coup

1207
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:46.840
of a sovereign nation?

1208
01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:48.490
You know, most
journalists cause

1209
01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:50.620
chaos and frenzy
but have no idea

1210
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:52.450
what's actually
going on.

1211
01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:54.800
We are here to bring
stability and peace

1212
01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.980
to a complicated
situation.

1213
01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.850
You really think that
your reporting

1214
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:02.940
can change the will
of the powerful?

1215
01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:05.770
This might sound crazy,
but, yes, I do.

1216
01:14:05.970 --> 01:14:07.770
- Kind of part of the gig.
- It certainly sounds nice,

1217
01:14:07.970 --> 01:14:09.210
and I wish you were
right, Claire.

1218
01:14:09.410 --> 01:14:10.690
I really do.

1219
01:14:10.890 --> 01:14:13.040
Unfortunately,
people are foolish.

1220
01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:14.520
People just want honesty.

1221
01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:15.910
They don't know
what they want.

1222
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:17.390
They can't see
what matters.

1223
01:14:17.590 --> 01:14:20.040
They need looking after.

1224
01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:21.480
So what matters?

1225
01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.310
What matters is power.

1226
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:27.620
You can hold it
and use it.

1227
01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:29.530
And who's using you?

1228
01:14:29.730 --> 01:14:32.580
Well, Claire, certainly
people who don't like

1229
01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.580
what you're doing.

1230
01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:37.770
They don't give
a rat's ass
about journalists.

1231
01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:43.200
Mason:
How much further?

1232
01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.370
Venegas:
We're almost there.

1233
01:14:44.570 --> 01:14:46.170
It's just over the ridge.

1234
01:14:55.830 --> 01:14:58.560
What's with
the singing, man?

1235
01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.390
You noticed?

1236
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:04.700
Well, I believe that
when one encounters danger,

1237
01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:06.440
you should sing to it.

1238
01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.530
You care to try?

1239
01:15:08.730 --> 01:15:10.180
Not much of a singer.

1240
01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:12.180
Not much
of a dancer either.

1241
01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:13.970
Ha ha ha!

1242
01:15:14.170 --> 01:15:15.360
You're not afraid
of a big belly laugh

1243
01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.450
every now
and again, huh?

1244
01:15:16.650 --> 01:15:18.140
Oh. Of course not.

1245
01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:21.290
I believe that
one should always
remember to laugh.

1246
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:25.080
Well, I found out
why I'm here.

1247
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:28.630
Oh.

1248
01:15:28.830 --> 01:15:31.420
They wanted me
to kill you.

1249
01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:33.070
That makes sense.

1250
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:34.940
- It does?
- Of course.

1251
01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:37.160
You blame me
for shooting down
your helicopter,

1252
01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:40.210
for your friends dying,
for your life ever since.

1253
01:15:40.410 --> 01:15:42.650
Then my late bodyguard
Manuel gives you a gun

1254
01:15:42.850 --> 01:15:44.170
and lets you
into my bedroom.

1255
01:15:44.370 --> 01:15:45.740
Wait. You knew
about that?

1256
01:15:45.940 --> 01:15:47.090
I don't stay in power

1257
01:15:47.290 --> 01:15:49.570
by not knowing
things, Mason.

1258
01:15:49.770 --> 01:15:51.130
I'd be so bad
at being a dictator.

1259
01:15:51.330 --> 01:15:52.790
No. You'd be great
at it.

1260
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:55.620
It's just practice.

1261
01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.360
There is something important
I need to tell you, though.

1262
01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.580
I didn't shoot down
your helicopter.

1263
01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.100
Come on, man.

1264
01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:04.840
I know you
didn't personally.

1265
01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:07.450
It was friendly fire.

1266
01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:10.240
Do you really think we
can stop an American invasion

1267
01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.890
by shooting down
one helicopter?

1268
01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.940
I mean, of course,
I knew you guys were coming,

1269
01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:17.290
but there was
nothing I could do
to stop you,

1270
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:21.250
so as a matter of fact,
I was getting ready to
take a boat to Cuba,

1271
01:16:21.450 --> 01:16:23.640
and suddenly,
a helicopter gets shot down,

1272
01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:28.340
and everything stops
just like that,

1273
01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:30.430
and the next morning,
I get a visit

1274
01:16:30.630 --> 01:16:32.830
from one of my ex-patrons
telling me that

1275
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:36.090
the next time the helicopter
would land

1276
01:16:36.290 --> 01:16:40.050
unless I signed off
some new oil leases,

1277
01:16:40.250 --> 01:16:42.420
which of course I did.

1278
01:16:45.900 --> 01:16:47.640
We were pawns.

1279
01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:52.250
I am very sorry about
your friends, Mason.

1280
01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:00.900
It's just crazy how all
this is going down

1281
01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.650
after you agree to do
your first interview
in 10 years.

1282
01:17:05.310 --> 01:17:08.120
Ah. That's why you
needed Claire.

1283
01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.130
You were gonna tell
the truth before they
could take you out

1284
01:17:10.330 --> 01:17:12.530
and replace
you with somebody
more user-friendly.

1285
01:17:16.410 --> 01:17:18.050
Venegas: We'll stop
here for the night,

1286
01:17:18.250 --> 01:17:21.630
and then, then we
end the charade.

1287
01:17:58.140 --> 01:18:00.520
Brother, you are
killing me right now.

1288
01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.960
I'm worried
sick about you.

1289
01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.530
- Are you still with Venegas?
- Yeah.

1290
01:18:03.730 --> 01:18:05.750
I cut ties
with the South Africans.

1291
01:18:05.950 --> 01:18:07.810
I'm gonna make
this go away.

1292
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:12.840
Dude, we need to talk.

1293
01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.360
- Gracias.
- Sí.

1294
01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:17.110
- Gracias.
- De nada.

1295
01:18:17.310 --> 01:18:19.110
Thanks.

1296
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:22.340
Mmm. Heh heh heh.

1297
01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:31.180
So I agreed to
trade you for Claire.

1298
01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:35.340
Of course you did.

1299
01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.600
Heh. Yeah, it's a...

1300
01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:40.960
move I haven't totally
thought through, but...

1301
01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:43.700
Hmm.

1302
01:18:43.900 --> 01:18:45.310
May I please
use your phone?

1303
01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:47.570
For what?

1304
01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:49.440
I am going to call
someone I trust.

1305
01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.710
- Eduardo Lavato.
- Who's that?

1306
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:54.230
He's an old friend

1307
01:18:54.430 --> 01:18:58.100
and the shadow leader
of the opposition party, too.

1308
01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:00.550
He's very resourceful.

1309
01:19:12.780 --> 01:19:15.030
Mason, please, will you
sit down and enjoy

1310
01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:16.730
a cup of espresso
with me?

1311
01:19:16.930 --> 01:19:18.040
It's the best one
in Paldoñia, huh?

1312
01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:19.820
This is a stupid idea.

1313
01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:22.780
Gracias, amor.

1314
01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.700
What is that saying?

1315
01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:25.910
Keep your friends close,

1316
01:19:26.110 --> 01:19:27.740
keep your enemies closer.

1317
01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:30.530
Yes it's from "The Go"--
it's from "The Godfather."

1318
01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:34.460
America does produce
some wonderful culture,
don't you agree?

1319
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:58.440
Papi. Ha ha ha!

1320
01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:01.950
- You're alive Papi!
- I am!

1321
01:20:02.150 --> 01:20:03.730
It's good to see you.

1322
01:20:03.930 --> 01:20:05.260
It was not my men
who attacked you.

1323
01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:06.560
I know, I know.

1324
01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.710
- Espresso?
- Naturally.

1325
01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.830
Who is this?

1326
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:14.480
This is my new
American friend Mason Pettits,

1327
01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:16.530
and he's very
worried about you.

1328
01:20:16.730 --> 01:20:18.540
- An American friend?
- Mm-hmm.

1329
01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:21.710
You really have
hit bottom.

1330
01:20:21.910 --> 01:20:23.940
Ah. Sit down.
Sit down.

1331
01:20:27.340 --> 01:20:28.760
Eduardo: Did you know
we went

1332
01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.370
to secondary
school together?

1333
01:20:31.570 --> 01:20:33.630
- Jesuits.
- Jesuits.

1334
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:35.330
And I could tell you
something.

1335
01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.200
They did not let us get
away with anything.

1336
01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:40.550
Nada. Hmm? Heh heh heh.

1337
01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:42.690
This is delicious.

1338
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:46.080
So do tell.

1339
01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:48.340
What can the People's
Worker Party

1340
01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:50.480
and/or The Armed
Revolutionary Front

1341
01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:53.360
of Paldoñia do
for you today?

1342
01:20:55.890 --> 01:20:58.410
Just a petite favor,
my friend.

1343
01:21:04.240 --> 01:21:08.580
Mason:
So, uh, I got to ask.

1344
01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:11.110
Why have an espresso
with a man who calls me

1345
01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:13.020
a thief and a butcher
on a daily basis

1346
01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:15.460
and every so often
lets off a bomb downtown?

1347
01:21:15.660 --> 01:21:18.370
Yeah. Yeah.

1348
01:21:18.570 --> 01:21:20.990
Well, perception is
reality, my friend.

1349
01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:23.810
I pay Lavato
and his resistance.

1350
01:21:24.010 --> 01:21:26.030
Every couple of months,
I let them blow up a car,

1351
01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:29.120
burn down a building,
staging a caravan.

1352
01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:32.820
It's like--it's like
a steam valve, you know?

1353
01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:34.870
Lets off pressure.

1354
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:37.480
Psssss.

1355
01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:39.870
And then I crack down
on them so everybody knows

1356
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:42.880
they need Venegas
to give order, huh?

1357
01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:44.360
Ha ha ha!

1358
01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.750
My granduncle, he--

1359
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:47.140
Your granduncle
you overthrew?

1360
01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.490
Yes, that one.
He never understood this.

1361
01:21:48.690 --> 01:21:50.010
Took everything
personally.

1362
01:21:50.210 --> 01:21:52.320
Of course,
it backfired on him.

1363
01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.860
So wait.

1364
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:57.460
So you--you bought
the revolution?

1365
01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.850
Much simpler
and a lot of cheaper.

1366
01:22:00.050 --> 01:22:01.460
It's like you Americans
like to say,

1367
01:22:01.660 --> 01:22:03.160
"A win-win."

1368
01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:06.430
You should see
Eduardo's pool. Oh!

1369
01:22:46.230 --> 01:22:47.870
Keep her there.

1370
01:22:52.220 --> 01:22:53.730
Colonel Koehorst?

1371
01:22:53.930 --> 01:22:55.820
Former South African SAS.

1372
01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:57.430
Three-two Battalion.

1373
01:22:57.630 --> 01:22:59.130
U.S. Army Special Forces?

1374
01:22:59.330 --> 01:23:01.260
Me? I'm a lawyer.

1375
01:23:01.460 --> 01:23:03.960
Sorry. All out
of business cards.

1376
01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:05.440
Pretty brazen thing
you're doing here,

1377
01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.830
taking over
a sovereign nation.

1378
01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:08.440
Sovereign?

1379
01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:10.050
When all's said and done,
no one's gonna have

1380
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:12.230
a problem with what
we're doing here.

1381
01:23:12.430 --> 01:23:13.790
The people
of Paldoñia might.

1382
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:15.880
They won't know
the difference.

1383
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:17.640
Status quo, my friend.

1384
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:23.280
You should have done
what was expected,
Sergeant Pettits.

1385
01:23:23.480 --> 01:23:26.280
Nah. I would have
never gotten near him.

1386
01:23:26.480 --> 01:23:28.240
You see, Venegas knew
it was going down.

1387
01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.720
You'd be surprised
what that guy
knows actually.

1388
01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:32.200
Sharp dude,
great dresser.

1389
01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.130
Are we doing this then?

1390
01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.180
Let's do it.

1391
01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:44.490
Bring
the princess out of the car.

1392
01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.530
Unh!

1393
01:23:55.730 --> 01:23:57.050
Koehorst: Time for you
to hand over Venegas

1394
01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:59.710
and piss off
out of the country.

1395
01:23:59.910 --> 01:24:01.750
If you don't do that
in 5 seconds,

1396
01:24:01.950 --> 01:24:05.020
I'm going to kill
your client in front of you.

1397
01:24:05.220 --> 01:24:06.240
1...

1398
01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.540
2, 3, 4--

1399
01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:11.890
OK. OK.

1400
01:24:12.090 --> 01:24:13.430
OK!

1401
01:24:52.690 --> 01:24:54.080
Unh!

1402
01:24:59.480 --> 01:25:01.350
Move!

1403
01:25:03.870 --> 01:25:07.300
Go, go, go! Aah!

1404
01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:09.270
Get back!

1405
01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.580
What was that?

1406
01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:30.670
That was my people,
Claire, huh?

1407
01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:33.190
Now I give my people
a message,

1408
01:25:33.390 --> 01:25:35.070
and you share it
with the world.

1409
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:36.760
Great. Let's get started.

1410
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.020
I--I can live feed it
through Infamous Daily.

1411
01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:39.810
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1412
01:25:40.010 --> 01:25:41.380
I cannot deliver such
an important message from here.

1413
01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:42.680
We have to do it
from my palace

1414
01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:44.160
with my nephew
by my side.

1415
01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:45.680
Come on. What, do we
just go up

1416
01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.510
and knock
on the front door? No.

1417
01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:50.400
There is another way.

1418
01:25:52.050 --> 01:25:56.000
Oh. Watch your
head there, OK?

1419
01:25:56.200 --> 01:25:57.610
This is the tunnel
I used to escape

1420
01:25:57.810 --> 01:25:59.390
when they tried to
kill me 8 years ago.

1421
01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:01.130
Are you sure this tunnel
isn't guarded?

1422
01:26:01.330 --> 01:26:02.830
Absolutely!

1423
01:26:03.030 --> 01:26:04.920
All the people who know
about it are dead now.

1424
01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.570
What about the other
times they tried
to kill you?

1425
01:26:06.770 --> 01:26:09.450
Oh, that's different
dead people.

1426
01:26:09.650 --> 01:26:11.200
Let's go.

1427
01:26:36.010 --> 01:26:37.520
- Hey.
- Aah! Ohh!

1428
01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:39.090
Uncle!

1429
01:26:39.290 --> 01:26:40.130
No, no.

1430
01:26:40.330 --> 01:26:41.130
OK. Hey, hey, hey.
Thank you.

1431
01:26:41.330 --> 01:26:42.260
No, thank you.

1432
01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:44.230
I am not here to hurt you.

1433
01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:46.350
It's OK.

1434
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:48.880
These are
my American friends.

1435
01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.840
They are here to help.

1436
01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:52.880
What is this
woman doing?

1437
01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:55.280
I'm live streaming this
to the entire world.

1438
01:26:55.480 --> 01:26:57.500
Listen to me.

1439
01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.670
when you are no longer
useful to them,

1440
01:26:59.870 --> 01:27:01.760
they are going to
kill you.

1441
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.590
Paldoñia deserves
a better future,

1442
01:27:03.790 --> 01:27:06.850
not one controlled
by corporations.

1443
01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:11.650
We--we don't have
to be monsters anymore.

1444
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:22.750
Yes. Yes.

1445
01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:27.320
You've always
been my favorite.

1446
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:31.620
General Martínez.

1447
01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:34.100
Mr. President.

1448
01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.160
Alive and kicking!

1449
01:27:37.590 --> 01:27:39.160
So I see.

1450
01:27:43.160 --> 01:27:44.760
Ohh!

1451
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.690
Aah! Aah!

1452
01:27:51.690 --> 01:27:53.070
You good?

1453
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:54.680
Yeah.

1454
01:28:01.010 --> 01:28:03.690
Yeah. I'm OK.
I'm OK. I'm OK.

1455
01:28:03.890 --> 01:28:05.430
Look. Look.

1456
01:28:05.630 --> 01:28:09.260
Ahh. Heh. Ha ha!

1457
01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.700
Bulletproof suit
from Medici.

1458
01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:13.140
Ha ha ha! Huh?

1459
01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:15.090
I should have one
made for you.

1460
01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:18.710
Jorge. Jorge.

1461
01:28:20.520 --> 01:28:21.970
Jorge. Jorge.

1462
01:28:22.170 --> 01:28:23.410
You're okay! You're okay!

1463
01:28:23.610 --> 01:28:24.860
You're okay!

1464
01:28:28.390 --> 01:28:31.250
Uncle...

1465
01:28:31.990 --> 01:28:32.910
Shh.

1466
01:28:33.170 --> 01:28:34.240
Uncle...

1467
01:28:35.690 --> 01:28:37.740
They killed... me.

1468
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:40.920
Shh. Shh, shh.
Shh, shh, shh.

1469
01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:43.530
I'm s-- I'm sorry.

1470
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:20.690
Surrender!

1471
01:29:22.260 --> 01:29:23.950
Soldiers!

1472
01:29:24.150 --> 01:29:27.180
I know you are obeying orders.

1473
01:29:27.960 --> 01:29:29.490
My children...

1474
01:29:30.230 --> 01:29:32.490
You don't have to do this.

1475
01:29:33.450 --> 01:29:35.480
My brothers.

1476
01:29:35.680 --> 01:29:39.270
You can change the destiny
of this country.

1477
01:29:39.470 --> 01:29:41.440
Not for me.

1478
01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:43.630
But for you.

1479
01:29:45.420 --> 01:29:47.490
For your mothers.

1480
01:29:47.690 --> 01:29:49.460
For your fathers.

1481
01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:53.280
For your children.

1482
01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:56.280
This country has bled
for too long.

1483
01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:58.950
This madness has to end.

1484
01:30:05.040 --> 01:30:06.210
Oh, shit.

1485
01:30:06.410 --> 01:30:08.250
Now is the time
to fight...

1486
01:30:08.450 --> 01:30:12.180
Fight... for this land.

1487
01:30:16.450 --> 01:30:17.960
My brothers.

1488
01:30:18.160 --> 01:30:19.260
Defend

1489
01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:21.190
your homeland.

1490
01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.070
Go!

1491
01:30:40.770 --> 01:30:42.560
Mason: Take cover!

1492
01:30:45.210 --> 01:30:46.910
Man: Suppressing fire!

1493
01:30:51.050 --> 01:30:53.030
Venegas:
Go! Go for Paldoñia!

1494
01:30:53.230 --> 01:30:55.650
Hey! Not the time
for coaching.

1495
01:30:55.850 --> 01:30:57.360
- Fuck, man!
- Oh!

1496
01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.050
Spielberg, what
the hell are you doing?

1497
01:31:08.250 --> 01:31:09.220
- What?
- Stay down!

1498
01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:10.800
Fine!

1499
01:31:14.630 --> 01:31:17.060
Take the tunnel, OK?
Hold on. Hold on.

1500
01:31:17.260 --> 01:31:21.290
Ready? Go, go, go,
go, go!

1501
01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.380
Follow me!
Follow me!

1502
01:31:29.580 --> 01:31:31.120
Mason?

1503
01:31:33.580 --> 01:31:35.470
Go, go!

1504
01:31:35.670 --> 01:31:38.400
- You've been hit.
- I'm fine! Go!

1505
01:31:40.660 --> 01:31:42.530
Claire: Aah!

1506
01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.930
See? I'm fine.

1507
01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:53.270
Come in.
We're safe here.

1508
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:55.660
This is my man cave.

1509
01:31:55.860 --> 01:31:58.270
Oh. You care
for a drink?

1510
01:31:58.470 --> 01:32:00.060
Mason: Yeah. I always
love a single malt

1511
01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.640
after I kneecap
a few mercenaries.

1512
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:08.410
Come on, Mason.
Embrace the suck.

1513
01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:09.910
Nnn, nnn, nnn.

1514
01:32:12.300 --> 01:32:13.820
Uh-oh.

1515
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:33.740
Hmm. Ah! Yes.

1516
01:32:33.940 --> 01:32:36.410
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

1517
01:32:42.590 --> 01:32:44.250
This way. Come on.

1518
01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:51.080
Mr. Venegas?

1519
01:32:53.690 --> 01:32:55.690
Mr. President?

1520
01:32:56.210 --> 01:32:57.610
Yes...

1521
01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.510
- Mason: Go!
- Claire: Aah!

1522
01:32:59.710 --> 01:33:01.640
Go, go, go!

1523
01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:03.920
Go, go, go!

1524
01:33:09.660 --> 01:33:12.750
Go, go, go, go, go.

1525
01:33:18.020 --> 01:33:19.180
That way. That way.

1526
01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:21.360
We have to go
that way.

1527
01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:22.590
Claire: Aah!

1528
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:33.380
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1529
01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:14.030
Agh!

1530
01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:22.520
- Get down.
- OK.

1531
01:34:29.090 --> 01:34:30.480
Aah!

1532
01:35:01.950 --> 01:35:04.460
- Let's go! Let's go!
- OK.

1533
01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.170
Ready? Aah!

1534
01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:27.280
Errgh!

1535
01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:32.660
Say hello
to your mates for me.

1536
01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:35.360
Shame it took so long
to finish the job.

1537
01:35:35.560 --> 01:35:38.620
You--you killed
my friends.

1538
01:35:38.820 --> 01:35:40.450
There were 7 of us.

1539
01:35:40.650 --> 01:35:43.020
RPGs aren't
that easy to aim.

1540
01:35:43.220 --> 01:35:45.690
It's just a job,
my friend.

1541
01:35:51.400 --> 01:35:52.510
Unh!

1542
01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:56.160
Hey.

1543
01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.430
Where'd you learn that?

1544
01:35:57.630 --> 01:35:58.730
The throat thing?

1545
01:35:58.930 --> 01:36:00.730
Thank my dad
for that.

1546
01:36:00.930 --> 01:36:02.430
I told you
I could help.

1547
01:36:05.070 --> 01:36:06.520
Let's go.

1548
01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:19.630
Mason! I could
really use your
help right now.

1549
01:36:22.550 --> 01:36:23.810
Shit!

1550
01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:30.250
- Shit!
- Oh, my God.

1551
01:36:48.050 --> 01:36:49.840
Aah! Aah!

1552
01:36:58.500 --> 01:36:59.750
What?

1553
01:36:59.950 --> 01:37:00.970
- Oh, oh.
- Nothing.

1554
01:37:01.170 --> 01:37:02.550
- Keep shooting them.
- OK.

1555
01:37:13.730 --> 01:37:16.810
- Come on!
- Let's go!

1556
01:37:17.010 --> 01:37:18.220
Sebastian: On me!

1557
01:37:20.130 --> 01:37:21.730
Man: Down the hall!

1558
01:37:21.930 --> 01:37:23.420
Sebastian: Hey, bro!

1559
01:37:23.620 --> 01:37:25.470
Ha ha! Chicks Dig It!

1560
01:37:25.670 --> 01:37:26.950
- Huh?
- Huh?

1561
01:37:27.150 --> 01:37:28.970
It's an inside joke.

1562
01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.960
Man: Go! Go! Go!

1563
01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:33.580
Different man:
Take cover!

1564
01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:36.320
Sebastian: Come on!

1565
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:39.660
- Yes!
- Unh!

1566
01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:40.750
Sorry I'm late, brother.

1567
01:37:40.950 --> 01:37:42.330
You kidding me?

1568
01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:47.540
Never thought
I'd say this,

1569
01:37:47.740 --> 01:37:49.410
but I'd like
to introduce you

1570
01:37:49.610 --> 01:37:52.320
to President Venegas.

1571
01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.500
Welcome to Paldoñia.

1572
01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:55.980
Nice to meet you...

1573
01:37:56.180 --> 01:37:57.690
I think.

1574
01:38:01.870 --> 01:38:03.260
Oh!

1575
01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:07.350
Man: Retreat!

1576
01:38:12.530 --> 01:38:15.350
Anchor: The eyes of the world
are still fixed on Paldoñia,

1577
01:38:15.550 --> 01:38:18.350
where the fallout from a failed
coup continues to play out.

1578
01:38:18.550 --> 01:38:20.740
In a bold act
of guerrilla journalism,

1579
01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:23.480
using a live stream through
gossip site Infamous Daily,

1580
01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:26.100
celebrity reporter
Claire Wellington provided

1581
01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.450
on-the-ground coverage
of these shocking events.

1582
01:38:29.650 --> 01:38:32.450
The Paldoñian military were seen
in an intense gun battle

1583
01:38:32.650 --> 01:38:34.230
with members of what
we now know to be

1584
01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:36.240
a private military company.

1585
01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:38.370
Ms. Wellington has also uploaded

1586
01:38:38.570 --> 01:38:41.680
an exclusive uncut interview
with President Venegas,

1587
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.550
announcing a surprising reversal

1588
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:46.830
in the Paldoñian system
of government.

1589
01:38:49.650 --> 01:38:51.120
Claire: I know
as a journalist

1590
01:38:51.320 --> 01:38:52.910
I'm supposed to stay
objective and all,

1591
01:38:53.110 --> 01:38:56.080
but I have to say I really
admire what you're doing.

1592
01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:57.910
Well, you know
what they say.

1593
01:38:58.110 --> 01:39:01.320
The man who touches honey
will eventually...

1594
01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:04.310
lick his fingers.

1595
01:39:04.510 --> 01:39:06.830
Claire: Oh. Hmm.

1596
01:39:07.030 --> 01:39:08.880
Ha ha!

1597
01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:11.230
I really appreciate
you two.

1598
01:39:11.430 --> 01:39:13.970
I really do.

1599
01:39:14.170 --> 01:39:18.280
And look. The world
is finally seeing us,

1600
01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:21.370
and it is all because
of you, Miss Wellington.

1601
01:39:21.570 --> 01:39:23.460
Looks like your
tattoo was right.

1602
01:39:23.660 --> 01:39:25.460
Everything
worked out just fine.

1603
01:39:25.660 --> 01:39:28.030
Worked out fine,
thanks to you.

1604
01:39:28.230 --> 01:39:29.550
- Team effort.
- Yes!

1605
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:30.990
The right people
at the right time.

1606
01:39:31.190 --> 01:39:33.160
Yeah.

1607
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.820
Let's go tell
a story to the world.

1608
01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.300
I will follow
your lead.

1609
01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:39.730
Hold up just one second
just so I know.

1610
01:39:39.930 --> 01:39:42.040
How many people in this room
want to kill you right now?

1611
01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.800
Eh, probably half.

1612
01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.790
No, more than half.
Ha ha ha!

1613
01:39:48.990 --> 01:39:51.220
Ah. Let's go.
Come on.

1614
01:39:51.420 --> 01:39:53.310
Uh...

1615
01:39:58.030 --> 01:39:59.970
Venegas: Welcome.

1616
01:40:00.170 --> 01:40:05.110
As of today, I am no longer
the president of Paldoñia.

1617
01:40:05.310 --> 01:40:07.760
A transitional government
has been put in place

1618
01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.330
until the next free elections.

1619
01:40:09.530 --> 01:40:13.290
During this transitional period,
$5 billion will be invested

1620
01:40:13.490 --> 01:40:16.550
in health, education,
and infrastructure.

1621
01:40:16.750 --> 01:40:19.690
This is an investment
in the people of Paldoñia.

1622
01:40:19.890 --> 01:40:24.170
Today, you get back
what is rightfully yours,

1623
01:40:24.370 --> 01:40:27.430
and for the years to come,
we'll protect

1624
01:40:27.630 --> 01:40:32.090
and control these resources
with the sole purpose...

1625
01:40:32.290 --> 01:40:33.440
Mason.

1626
01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:35.400
of giving
this beautiful nation...

1627
01:40:35.600 --> 01:40:39.010
Like, uh, dancing when
he's, like, not fluent.

1628
01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:42.320
He's literally...

1629
01:40:42.520 --> 01:40:45.540
That's only because
you know...

1630
01:40:49.120 --> 01:40:52.290
Anyway, I want
to teach...

1631
01:40:52.490 --> 01:40:53.420
Daddy!

1632
01:40:53.620 --> 01:40:56.070
Hey, Worm. Ha ha ha!

1633
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:58.900
Aww! Ahh!

1634
01:40:59.100 --> 01:41:01.610
And check this out.

1635
01:41:02.870 --> 01:41:04.570
Boom.

1636
01:41:06.970 --> 01:41:09.040
What happened
to your face?

1637
01:41:09.240 --> 01:41:10.960
It's a long story.

1638
01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.280
- Oh, baby.
- Here I am.

1639
01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:18.980
In one piece.

1640
01:41:19.980 --> 01:41:23.010
Just so you know,
that broken man

1641
01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:24.320
you wanted a divorce,
he disappeared somewhere

1642
01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.970
in South America.

1643
01:41:26.170 --> 01:41:27.510
Ha ha ha!

1644
01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:30.800
I was really hoping
you'd reconsider.

1645
01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.850
Ah, you know what?

1646
01:41:34.050 --> 01:41:36.470
I think I'm gonna have
to consult my lawyer.

1647
01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:42.130
Oh, Mason.

1648
01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:05.500
I'm just gonna make
a...quick stop.

1649
01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:17.860
Shit.

1650
01:42:34.750 --> 01:42:36.740
- Yes!
- What? Huh?

1651
01:42:36.940 --> 01:42:38.870
Mason, voice-over:
And just like that,

1652
01:42:39.070 --> 01:42:41.440
I saw an incredible life
of minivans,

1653
01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:43.830
playdates, and amusement parks,

1654
01:42:44.030 --> 01:42:47.270
and for the first time in my
entire overachieving life...

1655
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:48.880
- No!
- That dance.

1656
01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:50.420
Mason, voice-over: I was happy.

1657
01:42:52.590 --> 01:42:55.540
What's up?

1658
01:42:55.740 --> 01:42:57.150
What do you say
we just take the rest

1659
01:42:57.350 --> 01:42:58.890
of the day off
and spend it
with the family?

1660
01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:00.670
- Yeah!
- Yeah, you like that?

1661
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:01.760
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

1662
01:43:01.960 --> 01:43:02.850
You're so cute. Why?

1663
01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:04.900
Uh, well, um...

1664
01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:06.480
Mason, voice-over:
I had purpose.

1665
01:43:18.710 --> 01:43:20.220
He says he doesn't
know that I know.

1666
01:43:20.420 --> 01:43:21.610
I think he does know.

1667
01:43:21.810 --> 01:43:23.000
He was there,
and then we came out,

1668
01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.610
and he was, like,
just dick staring,

1669
01:43:24.810 --> 01:43:26.180
and it was, like, weird
because, you know, like,

1670
01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:27.570
you only have
2 seconds, 5--5 tops...

1671
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:29.750
Well, because it's--
it's impressive.

1672
01:43:29.950 --> 01:43:31.230
to stare
at a guy's dick.

1673
01:43:31.430 --> 01:43:33.190
You look at that, it is
like a beast of its own.

1674
01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:34.670
He--it was, like--
I'm telling you it was...

1675
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:35.840
It's a snake.
It's a monster.

1676
01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:37.450
8 Mississippi.

1677
01:43:37.650 --> 01:43:40.280
Mason: Yeah, it's--yeah.
All right. What else?

1678
01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.190
Are you a serious
journalist for sure?

1679
01:43:42.390 --> 01:43:43.850
I am for sure
a serious journalist,

1680
01:43:44.050 --> 01:43:45.850
and I would like you to
take me seriously.

1681
01:43:46.050 --> 01:43:47.630
I don't understand why...

1682
01:43:47.830 --> 01:43:49.420
I think--I think
I can do that after
what just happened.

1683
01:43:49.620 --> 01:43:51.200
- you're not.
- No, that's fair.

1684
01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.900
Yeah.

1685
01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:05.170
2-5 seconds max, dude.

1686
01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:06.520
I am still
very sorry.

1687
01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:08.260
I didn't know you felt
this way, but we can--

1688
01:44:08.460 --> 01:44:10.090
Those are--those
are unwritten rules

1689
01:44:10.290 --> 01:44:11.960
on the walls
of every YMCA.

1690
01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.700
There are rooms up there,
We can--we can take this--

1691
01:44:13.900 --> 01:44:15.710
Every fucking YMCA
has something

1692
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:18.270
in the bathroom about
5 seconds dick staring max.

1693
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:19.410
- Really?
- Yeah, man.

1694
01:44:19.610 --> 01:44:20.990
Welcome to America.
