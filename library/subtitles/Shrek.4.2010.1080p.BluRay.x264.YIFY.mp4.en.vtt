00:00:42.184 --> 00:00:44.477
<i>Once upon a time, a long time ago,</i>

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:48.148
<i>a king and queen had a
beautiful daughter named Fiona.</i>

00:00:48.315 --> 00:00:51.025
<i>But she was possessed
by a terrible curse.</i>

00:00:51.193 --> 00:00:55.822
<i>By day, a lovely princess.
By night, a hideous ogre.</i>

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.741
<i>Only true love's kiss
could lift her curse.</i>

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.079
<i>So Fiona waited in a tower,
guarded by a dragon, until the day</i>

00:01:03.247 --> 00:01:05.957
<i>when her true love would arrive.</i>

00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.459
<i>But as the days turned into years,</i>

00:01:08.627 --> 00:01:12.589
<i>the King and Queen were forced
to resort to more desperate measures.</i>

00:02:04.475 --> 00:02:06.226
Whoa, there.

00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:09.312
I don't know about this, Lillian.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.816
Fairy Godmother said only true love's
kiss could break Fiona's curse.

00:02:13.984 --> 00:02:18.238
I don't trust that woman, Harold.
This may be our last hope.

00:02:18.405 --> 00:02:21.532
Besides, he does come
highly recommended by King Midas.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.329
But to put our daughter's life
in the hands of this... person?

00:02:26.497 --> 00:02:31.209
He's devious.
He's deceitful. He's, he's...

00:02:31.377 --> 00:02:33.753
Rumpelstiltskin!

00:02:37.591 --> 00:02:39.133
Mrs Highness.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.177
How do you do?

00:02:43.097 --> 00:02:44.847
Down, Fifi. Get down!

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:49.352
As you can see, everything's in order.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.231
So you'll put an end
to our daughter's curse?

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:57.735
And, in return, you sign the kingdom
of Far Far Away over to me.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:07.954
- Lillian, this is madness!
- What choice do we have?

00:03:08.122 --> 00:03:11.666
Fiona has been locked away
in that tower far too long.

00:03:11.834 --> 00:03:13.918
It's not like she's getting any younger.

00:03:14.086 --> 00:03:16.754
But to sign over our entire kingdom?

00:03:16.922 --> 00:03:19.841
Well, if your kingdom's worth
more to you than your daughter...

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:23.636
Nothing is worth more to us
than our daughter.

00:03:27.141 --> 00:03:28.641
Jump, Fifi, jump!

00:03:34.815 --> 00:03:38.651
Just sign it and all your problems
will disappear.

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.664
Your Highness! The Princess!
She's been saved!

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:58.171
Who saved her?

00:03:58.922 --> 00:04:01.716
No one would have guessed
that an ogre named Shrek,

00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:03.968
whose roar was feared
throughout the land,

00:04:04.136 --> 00:04:06.804
would save the beautiful Princess Fiona.

00:04:06.972 --> 00:04:09.932
True love's kiss led to marriage
and ogre babies!

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.227
The kingdom of Far Far Away
was finally at peace.

00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:17.774
Goody for them!
And they lived happily ever after!

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.153
Sir? You're gonna
have to pay for that.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.074
Maybe we could make a deal
for it, little boy?

00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.952
- Oh, I'm not a real boy.
- Do you want to be?

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:36.876
Nobody needs your deals
anymore, Grumpel Stinkypants!

00:04:42.883 --> 00:04:46.386
I wish that ogre was never born!

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.650
Wake up, Daddy, wake up!

00:05:01.402 --> 00:05:04.570
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

00:05:07.658 --> 00:05:09.242
Better out than in.

00:05:09.952 --> 00:05:11.160
That's my line.

00:05:11.328 --> 00:05:14.288
Did my little Fergus make a...

00:05:14.456 --> 00:05:17.708
...big, grownup ogre stink?!

00:05:17.876 --> 00:05:21.087
Oh, that's diabolical!

00:05:23.298 --> 00:05:26.426
And on your left, the lovable lug
that showed us you don't have to

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:28.970
change your undies
to change the world!

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.306
I wonder what Shrek's up to in there.

00:05:32.474 --> 00:05:35.768
Get in there. Get...
Impossible to put on!

00:05:36.687 --> 00:05:40.064
OK, the dragon goes under the bridge,
through the loop...

00:05:40.232 --> 00:05:42.608
...and finally, into the castle.

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:49.323
Play date!

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.499
Then Shrek kissed the Princess.

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:00.710
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

00:06:00.878 --> 00:06:01.919
Happily...

00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:03.546
- Ever...
- After.

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:11.512
Look! A shooting star!

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.725
So, what did you wish for?

00:06:15.893 --> 00:06:17.977
That every day could be like this one.

00:06:18.145 --> 00:06:19.604
Come here, you.

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:33.951
Morning, Daddy.

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:35.244
Morning.

00:06:37.498 --> 00:06:38.498
Better out than in.

00:06:39.833 --> 00:06:41.667
Did my little Fergus make a...

00:06:45.005 --> 00:06:47.048
Cute. Real cute.

00:06:48.842 --> 00:06:50.009
This lovable lug taught us

00:06:50.177 --> 00:06:53.095
you don't have to change
your undies to change the world!

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:55.181
Play date!

00:06:57.768 --> 00:07:00.394
Shrek! The outhouse is clogged up!

00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:03.523
She turned into a beautiful ogre
and they lived...

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:04.690
- Happily...
- Ever...

00:07:04.858 --> 00:07:05.900
After?

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:10.863
- Daddy, get up!
- Morning.

00:07:12.991 --> 00:07:15.868
- Better out than in.
- This lovable lug...

00:07:16.662 --> 00:07:18.204
- Play date!
- No!

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.290
Outhouse again!

00:07:21.458 --> 00:07:22.542
Come on.

00:07:26.463 --> 00:07:27.630
Undies!

00:07:29.466 --> 00:07:30.550
Outhouse!

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:32.843
- Get up, get up!
- And they lived...

00:07:33.011 --> 00:07:34.470
- Happily...
- Ever...

00:07:34.638 --> 00:07:35.888
After.

00:08:26.607 --> 00:08:27.940
Roar.

00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.658
Nice landing, baby.

00:09:18.825 --> 00:09:21.202
Hey! Now remember, don't eat the valet.

00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:26.290
Happy birthday, ninos!
Vamos a la fiesta!

00:09:27.626 --> 00:09:29.251
Hey, Shrek, Shrek!

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:33.047
Mr Shrek, would you
sign our pitchforks?

00:09:33.215 --> 00:09:34.298
And our torches?

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:36.175
Oh, man, you used to be so fierce!

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:38.177
Yeah, when you were a real ogre!

00:09:38.345 --> 00:09:40.262
A real ogre?

00:09:51.733 --> 00:09:54.735
Shrek, it's a sing-along.
You've got to sing along!

00:09:54.903 --> 00:09:58.030
- No, thanks.
- Please? I'll be your best friend.

00:09:58.198 --> 00:10:02.660
Why does being your best friend entail
me doing everything I don't want to do?

00:10:02.828 --> 00:10:05.162
Please, Felicia, not in Daddy's ear.

00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.580
Excuse me, Mr Shrek?

00:10:06.748 --> 00:10:08.916
Could you do that
ogre roar of yours for my son?

00:10:09.084 --> 00:10:10.584
He's a big, big fan.

00:10:10.752 --> 00:10:11.877
Do the roar.

00:10:12.045 --> 00:10:14.839
You know, I'd rather not.
It's my kids' birthday party.

00:10:15.006 --> 00:10:17.007
- Do the roar.
- Honey?

00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:18.509
Why don't you go check on the cake?

00:10:18.677 --> 00:10:22.054
- Sure.
- And don't forget the candles.

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:23.222
Hold still.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:25.391
Thanks for the pants, Muffin Man.

00:10:25.559 --> 00:10:28.436
I always wanted chaps!
Yee-haw! Giddy up!

00:10:28.603 --> 00:10:29.979
- Monsieur Shrek.
- Howdy, Shrek!

00:10:30.147 --> 00:10:31.981
Your cake. Voil�!

00:10:33.108 --> 00:10:36.318
- What is that supposed to be?
- That's Sprinkles the Ogre!

00:10:36.486 --> 00:10:38.863
Isn't he cute? He looks just like you.

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:41.282
But happy. It's a party, Shrek.
You gotta cheer up!

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:43.033
I'm in a great mood, actually.

00:10:43.201 --> 00:10:46.078
- Oh, I'm gonna lick me a rainbow!
- Donkey!

00:10:46.246 --> 00:10:47.413
As long as you're not doing anything,

00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.039
how about one of those
famous Shrek roars?

00:10:49.207 --> 00:10:51.751
- Do the roar.
- Let me set you straight, Butter Pants.

00:10:51.918 --> 00:10:54.462
An ogre only roars when he's angry.

00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:56.714
You don't want to see me angry, do you?

00:10:56.882 --> 00:10:58.174
Do it.

00:10:59.593 --> 00:11:01.469
Hold it together. Just hold it together.

00:11:01.636 --> 00:11:03.721
Daddy, he's getting away. Do something.

00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:05.181
Oh, good.

00:11:05.348 --> 00:11:08.851
- What happened to the cake?
- Trust me. It's an improvement.

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:10.603
- You licked it!
- No.

00:11:10.771 --> 00:11:13.647
Just because you're an ogre,
doesn't mean you have to eat like one.

00:11:13.815 --> 00:11:16.108
Looks like you forgot the candles!

00:11:16.276 --> 00:11:18.527
OK, just watch the cake.
I'll go get them.

00:11:18.695 --> 00:11:19.987
Watch the cake?

00:11:20.614 --> 00:11:22.782
- Where's the cake?!
- We ate the cake.

00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:24.033
- Ya.
- What?

00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:25.451
No, don't cry.

00:11:25.619 --> 00:11:28.120
Hey! I believe you
promised my son a roar.

00:11:28.288 --> 00:11:29.705
- Do the roar.
- Roar.

00:11:29.873 --> 00:11:32.166
- I don't like it.
- Pigs, we need another cake.

00:11:32.334 --> 00:11:35.169
- We ate the other cakes.
- One roar, man.

00:11:35.337 --> 00:11:37.755
Hey, everybody!
Shrek's gonna do his famous ogre roar!

00:11:37.923 --> 00:11:40.633
Not now, Donkey.
Pigs, are there any cupcakes?

00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.676
- We ate them, too.
- They have lollipops.

00:11:42.844 --> 00:11:44.011
No, I ate them.

00:11:44.179 --> 00:11:46.889
- You didn't share?
- Well, you didn't share the croissants!

00:11:47.057 --> 00:11:50.059
- Everything's gonna be OK.
- Shrek, what's going on?

00:11:50.227 --> 00:11:52.186
- Come on, Shrek, your fans are waiting!
- Do the roar.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.648
We need the cake!

00:11:56.983 --> 00:11:59.318
Cake! Cake! Cake!

00:12:14.376 --> 00:12:15.459
I love you, Daddy.

00:12:15.627 --> 00:12:18.337
Everybody, I have found another cake!

00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:21.715
Shrek? Are you OK?

00:12:49.452 --> 00:12:52.663
- Unbelievable.
- Tell me about it! Those villagers...

00:12:52.831 --> 00:12:56.166
I'm not talking about the villagers,
Shrek. I'm talking about you.

00:12:56.334 --> 00:12:59.336
Is this really how you want
to remember the kids' first birthday?

00:12:59.504 --> 00:13:03.507
- Oh, great. So this is all my fault?
- Yes. But you know what?

00:13:03.675 --> 00:13:05.718
Let's talk about this
after the party, at home.

00:13:05.886 --> 00:13:08.596
You mean that roadside
attraction we live in?

00:13:08.763 --> 00:13:13.267
Step right up! See the dancing ogre!
Don't worry! He won't bite!

00:13:13.435 --> 00:13:17.605
I used to be an ogre.
Now I'm just a jolly green joke!

00:13:17.772 --> 00:13:22.067
OK, OK, maybe you're not
the ogre you used to be.

00:13:22.235 --> 00:13:23.944
But maybe that's not such a bad thing.

00:13:24.112 --> 00:13:27.781
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
It's not like you're a real ogre.

00:13:27.949 --> 00:13:30.242
You spent half your life in a palace.

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:32.953
And the other half
locked away in a tower.

00:13:34.414 --> 00:13:38.417
Look, all I want is for things to go
back to the way they used to be!

00:13:38.585 --> 00:13:43.339
Back when villagers were afraid of me,
and I could take a mud bath in peace.

00:13:43.506 --> 00:13:47.092
When I could do what I wanted,
when I wanted to do it!

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:50.638
Back when the world made sense!

00:13:50.805 --> 00:13:53.474
You mean back before you
rescued me from the Dragon's Keep?

00:13:53.642 --> 00:13:55.017
Exactly!

00:14:00.857 --> 00:14:05.110
Shrek, you have
three beautiful children,

00:14:05.278 --> 00:14:07.446
a wife who loves you,

00:14:07.614 --> 00:14:11.659
friends who adore you.
You have everything.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:18.499
Why is it the only person
who can't see that is you?

00:14:39.312 --> 00:14:40.980
That's just great.

00:14:48.822 --> 00:14:51.407
If she thinks I'm gonna
slink back there and apologize,

00:14:51.574 --> 00:14:54.827
she's got another thing coming.
She's not the boss of me.

00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:58.831
I'm an ogre and I'm not gonna apologize
for acting like one.

00:14:58.999 --> 00:15:03.335
Help, please!
Someone, anyone at all, help me!

00:15:03.503 --> 00:15:05.254
Please, help!

00:15:05.714 --> 00:15:07.297
Please, help!

00:15:07.674 --> 00:15:09.466
I'm stuck! Help!

00:15:09.634 --> 00:15:11.468
Oh, please, help!

00:15:11.636 --> 00:15:14.430
Someone, anyone! Help me!

00:15:14.597 --> 00:15:18.100
The pain! I can see
a bright light. A tunnel!

00:15:19.019 --> 00:15:20.728
Grandma? Is that you?

00:15:20.895 --> 00:15:22.271
Yeah, it's me, Granny.

00:15:22.439 --> 00:15:26.025
An ogre! Please, Mr Ogre,
please don't eat me!

00:15:26.192 --> 00:15:27.735
I'm not gonna eat you.

00:15:27.902 --> 00:15:31.196
But you are an ogre... Aren't you?

00:15:31.364 --> 00:15:34.199
Yeah, well, I... I used to be.

00:15:34.367 --> 00:15:36.785
Look, move out or get crushed.

00:15:36.953 --> 00:15:38.954
So you're not gonna eat me?

00:15:39.122 --> 00:15:43.959
No, thanks. I already had a big bowl
of curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

00:15:45.378 --> 00:15:48.338
Wait up! What's your rush?
Where you going?

00:15:48.506 --> 00:15:49.506
Nowhere.

00:15:49.674 --> 00:15:52.342
What a coincidence!
I was just heading that way myself.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:57.014
But, seriously,
let me give you a ride. I insist.

00:15:57.182 --> 00:16:01.560
Come on. It's the least I can do
after all you've done for me.

00:16:03.146 --> 00:16:04.646
I got a hot rat cooking.

00:16:06.608 --> 00:16:10.277
All right! Can I interest you
in a mudslide? Slug and tonic?

00:16:10.445 --> 00:16:13.405
A liquid libation
to ease that frustration?

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:17.868
- Eyeball-tini?
- Well, maybe just one.

00:16:18.787 --> 00:16:22.790
So the centaur says,
"That's not the half I'm talking about. "

00:16:23.833 --> 00:16:26.543
I gotta say, Shrek, I envy you.

00:16:26.711 --> 00:16:30.047
To live the life of an ogre...
no worries, no responsibilities.

00:16:30.215 --> 00:16:32.966
You are free to pillage
and terrorize as you please.

00:16:33.134 --> 00:16:36.428
- Free? That's a laugh.
- Oh, yeah?

00:16:37.013 --> 00:16:42.184
Sometimes I wish I had just one day
to feel like a real ogre again.

00:16:42.352 --> 00:16:43.477
Why didn't you say so?

00:16:43.645 --> 00:16:46.814
Magical transactions are my specialty!

00:16:46.981 --> 00:16:50.692
Great. Next to mimes,
magicians are my favourite people.

00:16:51.653 --> 00:16:53.153
Hold on.

00:16:53.321 --> 00:16:56.490
"King for a Month. "
"Knight for a Week. "

00:16:59.869 --> 00:17:01.870
Ogre for a day.

00:17:03.498 --> 00:17:05.541
Think about it, Shrek.
To be feared and hated.

00:17:05.708 --> 00:17:06.750
You'll be, like, "Roar!"

00:17:06.918 --> 00:17:10.504
And the villagers will be, like, "Get
away! It's Shrek! I'm so scared of him!"

00:17:10.672 --> 00:17:14.049
It would be just like the good old days,
when your swamp was your castle.

00:17:14.217 --> 00:17:19.847
- When the world made sense.
- All right, what's the catch?

00:17:20.014 --> 00:17:23.684
Catch? No. There's no catch.
No catchings, really.

00:17:23.852 --> 00:17:25.936
I mean, there's something.
Small thing. Nothing. A little thing.

00:17:26.104 --> 00:17:29.106
All right, I knew it.
So what do you want?

00:17:29.274 --> 00:17:31.108
- A day.
- A day.

00:17:31.276 --> 00:17:32.317
Rat's done!

00:17:33.862 --> 00:17:37.030
To make the magic work, you gotta
give something to get something.

00:17:37.198 --> 00:17:40.117
In this case, you gotta
give a day to get a day. That's all.

00:17:40.285 --> 00:17:42.995
I can't just pick up
and leave my family.

00:17:43.163 --> 00:17:46.832
But that's the best part, Shrek!
It's a magical contract.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.834
No one will even know you're gone.

00:17:49.002 --> 00:17:54.798
And by the time this day is up,
you are gonna feel like a changed ogre.

00:17:55.758 --> 00:17:57.759
Still, I don't know.

00:17:57.927 --> 00:18:01.471
Hey, no problem.
Forget it, no big D. Doesn't matter.

00:18:01.639 --> 00:18:04.141
Do you like white meat or dark meat?

00:18:05.393 --> 00:18:08.395
So what day would I have to give up?

00:18:08.563 --> 00:18:11.440
I don't know, any day.
A day from your past.

00:18:11.608 --> 00:18:14.026
A day you had the flu?
A day you lost a pet?

00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:16.612
A day some meddling oaf
stuck his nose where it didn't belong

00:18:16.779 --> 00:18:18.405
destroying your business
and ruining your life?!

00:18:22.076 --> 00:18:23.535
Just for an example.

00:18:23.703 --> 00:18:25.454
How about the day I met Donkey?

00:18:25.622 --> 00:18:28.123
Now, there's a day
I'd like to take back.

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:30.292
I don't know who that is.

00:18:31.127 --> 00:18:33.712
I know. What about a day
you wouldn't even remember?

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:36.089
Like a day when you were a baby.

00:18:36.257 --> 00:18:41.511
- An innocent, mindless little baby.
- Take any of those days you want.

00:18:41.679 --> 00:18:46.058
- Take them all for all I care.
- Oh, just one will do.

00:18:47.435 --> 00:18:50.103
OK, good.
A day from your childhood it is.

00:18:50.271 --> 00:18:53.899
I guess there's nothing wrong
with wanting a little time for myself.

00:18:54.067 --> 00:18:55.609
Just 24 tiny little hours.

00:18:55.777 --> 00:18:57.861
- I'm still my own ogre!
- Yeah, you is!

00:18:58.029 --> 00:19:00.280
I never needed to ask
for anyone's permission before.

00:19:00.448 --> 00:19:03.116
So why start now?

00:19:11.793 --> 00:19:13.252
Go on, Shrek.

00:19:13.419 --> 00:19:14.962
Sign it!

00:19:16.047 --> 00:19:17.506
Go on, Shrek.

00:19:18.633 --> 00:19:20.175
Sign it, Shrek! Sign it!

00:19:22.136 --> 00:19:23.178
You signed it.

00:19:23.346 --> 00:19:26.139
So, tell me. What happens now?

00:19:26.307 --> 00:19:27.975
Have a nice day.

00:19:45.952 --> 00:19:48.370
I think I fell on my keys.

00:19:48.538 --> 00:19:50.122
There are 40 children in that shoe,

00:19:50.290 --> 00:19:52.833
which is why the weasel
goes pop to this very day.

00:19:53.001 --> 00:19:54.042
Oh, great.

00:19:54.210 --> 00:19:56.712
As we head over the river
and through the woods...

00:19:56.879 --> 00:19:57.921
Ogre!

00:20:21.404 --> 00:20:23.196
Kill the ogre! Kill the ogre!

00:21:16.584 --> 00:21:19.544
This is the part where you run away!

00:21:41.109 --> 00:21:43.610
Sure is great to be wanted again.

00:21:44.946 --> 00:21:46.446
Nice one.

00:21:55.123 --> 00:21:56.498
Fiona?

00:22:06.676 --> 00:22:08.176
Oh, no.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.817
My home.

00:22:25.153 --> 00:22:26.486
Fiona!

00:22:28.656 --> 00:22:31.491
Fiona! Are you in there?!

00:23:09.197 --> 00:23:11.364
All right, Rumpel!

00:23:12.033 --> 00:23:14.534
This wasn't part of the deal!

00:23:17.872 --> 00:23:19.372
Rumpel!

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:42.812
Ogre!

00:23:43.898 --> 00:23:47.234
We've got another one, ladies! Get him!

00:23:48.778 --> 00:23:50.445
Who are you?!

00:23:50.613 --> 00:23:52.614
What are you doing in my swamp?

00:23:58.871 --> 00:24:01.081
Looks like a troublemaker!

00:24:13.636 --> 00:24:14.928
Spread 'em!

00:24:17.139 --> 00:24:19.266
Nice job, ladies!

00:24:26.816 --> 00:24:31.111
You witches are making a big mistake!
I know my rights!

00:24:31.279 --> 00:24:33.613
You have the right to shut your mouth!

00:24:53.467 --> 00:24:56.970
Donkey, stop with the singing, will you?

00:24:57.805 --> 00:24:59.139
Donkey!

00:25:08.482 --> 00:25:10.984
Donkey, where am I? What's happening?

00:25:11.152 --> 00:25:14.321
Quiet down there! Oh, I hate this song.

00:25:21.037 --> 00:25:23.830
I'm driving,
so I'm in charge of the music.

00:25:24.999 --> 00:25:27.834
Will you witches make up your mind?

00:25:36.636 --> 00:25:40.221
Donkey? What's going on?
Do you know where Fiona is?

00:25:40.848 --> 00:25:43.558
Quiet, ogre! You're gonna get me
in trouble and I need this job.

00:25:43.726 --> 00:25:45.393
I am not going back to work
for Old MacDonald.

00:25:45.561 --> 00:25:48.355
Tell me to E-I-E-I-O.
"E-I-E-I-No!" That's what I said.

00:25:48.522 --> 00:25:52.233
Where are my babies?
And where's your wife, Dragon?

00:25:52.401 --> 00:25:55.236
Look, I think you have me confused
with some other talking donkey.

00:25:55.404 --> 00:25:56.780
I've never seen you before in my life.

00:25:56.947 --> 00:25:59.532
Never seen me before?
Come on, Donkey!

00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:01.868
And how do you
know my name anyway?

00:26:02.036 --> 00:26:04.913
It's me, Shrek. Your best friend?

00:26:05.581 --> 00:26:06.998
A donkey and an ogre friends?

00:26:07.166 --> 00:26:09.417
That's the most
ridiculous thing I ever heard!

00:26:12.254 --> 00:26:14.756
Can you at least tell me
where they're taking me?

00:26:14.924 --> 00:26:18.093
To the same place they take
every ogre. To Rumpelstiltskin.

00:26:18.886 --> 00:26:21.971
- Stiltskin!
- I said quiet!

00:26:29.397 --> 00:26:32.107
Oh, no.

00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:46.079
It's time to crumble!

00:26:46.247 --> 00:26:50.583
Place your bets!
Place your bets! We start tout de suite!

00:26:50.793 --> 00:26:51.793
Yeah!

00:26:54.922 --> 00:26:56.297
Gingy?

00:27:00.261 --> 00:27:02.095
Gingy snap!

00:27:04.682 --> 00:27:05.724
There's one!

00:27:05.891 --> 00:27:07.600
Disgusting, filthy ogre!

00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:09.519
Hideous monster!

00:27:09.687 --> 00:27:11.312
Filthy, filthy creature!

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:13.773
Disgusting creature!

00:27:39.842 --> 00:27:41.551
Move it!

00:27:58.652 --> 00:28:01.404
Don't worry, Donkey.
I'll get us our lives back.

00:28:01.572 --> 00:28:04.741
Yeah, right. Put a little mustard
on mine, Captain Crazy!

00:28:41.862 --> 00:28:43.696
Mr Stiltskin?

00:28:45.741 --> 00:28:47.867
You got another customer.

00:28:48.244 --> 00:28:50.745
- Wolfie!
- Yes, Mr Stiltskin.

00:28:50.913 --> 00:28:52.747
Bring me my business wig.

00:28:52.915 --> 00:28:55.124
Mr Stiltskin, please!

00:28:58.045 --> 00:29:00.505
- OK, go.
- Please make me a real boy!

00:29:00.673 --> 00:29:04.050
Go away! Terms are
in the details, balsa boy.

00:29:04.218 --> 00:29:06.970
Sayonara, termites! Hello, acne!

00:29:07.555 --> 00:29:08.888
Stiltskin!

00:29:10.266 --> 00:29:11.349
Shrek!

00:29:13.310 --> 00:29:14.769
There he is!

00:29:15.771 --> 00:29:17.188
So close!

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.900
Have I been waiting for you!

00:29:21.777 --> 00:29:24.279
Ladies, this is the guy

00:29:24.446 --> 00:29:27.824
that made all of this possible!

00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:31.452
So, tell me, how are you
enjoying your day?

00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:34.747
All right, Rumpel, what's going on?
What have you done?

00:29:34.915 --> 00:29:38.084
No, Shrek, it's not what I've done.
It's what you've done.

00:29:38.252 --> 00:29:42.046
Thanks to you, the King and Queen
signed their kingdom over to me.

00:29:42.214 --> 00:29:43.631
They would never do that.

00:29:43.799 --> 00:29:48.428
They would if I promised them
all their problems would disappear.

00:29:49.930 --> 00:29:52.265
And then they disappeared!

00:30:01.609 --> 00:30:02.984
They would have done anything

00:30:03.152 --> 00:30:05.278
if they thought it would
end their daughter's curse.

00:30:05.446 --> 00:30:07.822
I ended Fiona's curse!

00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:11.326
How could you when you never existed?

00:30:11.493 --> 00:30:14.495
You better start making sense,
you dirty little man!

00:30:14.663 --> 00:30:16.956
Here, let me spell it out for you!

00:30:17.124 --> 00:30:21.461
You gave me a day from your past,
a day you couldn't even remember.

00:30:21.629 --> 00:30:25.840
A day when you were
an innocent, mindless little baby.

00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:31.054
You took the day I was born.

00:30:31.221 --> 00:30:34.223
No, Shrek. You gave it to me.

00:30:34.391 --> 00:30:37.936
Enjoy this while you can, Stiltskin,
because when this day is up...

00:30:38.103 --> 00:30:40.813
But you haven't heard the best part.

00:30:40.981 --> 00:30:46.694
Since you were never born, once
this day comes to an end, so will you.

00:30:50.741 --> 00:30:52.367
Where's Fiona?

00:30:53.077 --> 00:30:54.285
Where's my family?

00:30:54.453 --> 00:30:57.664
Silly little ogre.
You don't get it, do you?

00:30:57.831 --> 00:31:00.375
You see, you were never born.

00:31:00.542 --> 00:31:02.669
You never met Fiona.

00:31:02.836 --> 00:31:06.422
Your kids don't exist.

00:31:09.301 --> 00:31:12.512
How's that for a metaphysical paradox?

00:31:14.348 --> 00:31:16.766
Looks like you got
exactly what you wanted!

00:31:17.768 --> 00:31:21.020
- Happy Ogre Day!
- Rumpel!

00:31:23.023 --> 00:31:24.315
Get him, witches!

00:31:34.827 --> 00:31:38.079
You know what'd help morale
around here? Flip-flop Fridays.

00:31:38.247 --> 00:31:40.915
Feet be comfortable
with the breeze on your toes.

00:31:47.923 --> 00:31:49.590
Come on, girls!

00:32:00.227 --> 00:32:03.938
Lock all the doors,
you worthless witches! Do it!

00:32:06.734 --> 00:32:08.359
I'll be right back, Donkey!

00:32:08.527 --> 00:32:11.946
I don't know you! I don't know him!

00:32:31.425 --> 00:32:33.426
I'm glad I'm not you.

00:32:38.098 --> 00:32:39.432
Help me! Help!

00:32:40.642 --> 00:32:41.642
Help!

00:32:50.110 --> 00:32:51.652
No, not my pretty ball!

00:32:56.116 --> 00:32:57.950
Watch out!

00:33:10.172 --> 00:33:11.130
Wolfie?

00:33:11.298 --> 00:33:13.633
My angry wig.

00:33:22.184 --> 00:33:25.645
Help! I've been kidnapped
by a deranged, unbalanced ogre!

00:33:25.813 --> 00:33:27.230
Donkey! Get off of me!

00:33:27.397 --> 00:33:30.316
Watch it with your pointy hooves!

00:33:37.366 --> 00:33:38.991
- Just take my wallet!
- Hey!

00:33:39.159 --> 00:33:41.160
I'm being ass-napped!

00:33:41.787 --> 00:33:42.954
Animal cruelty! Help!

00:33:43.122 --> 00:33:45.206
You need to calm down!

00:33:45.374 --> 00:33:46.541
I'm your friend.

00:33:47.292 --> 00:33:49.377
I'm not gonna hurt you, all right?

00:33:50.337 --> 00:33:52.213
Good. I'm gonna let go...

00:33:52.381 --> 00:33:54.841
...right... now.

00:33:55.008 --> 00:33:57.552
Please! Eat my face last!
Send my hooves to my mama!

00:33:57.719 --> 00:34:00.179
Donkey! You've got to trust me.

00:34:00.347 --> 00:34:02.932
- Why should I trust you?
- Because...

00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.184
Because...

00:34:08.856 --> 00:34:10.189
OK.

00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.273
Fine! Go ahead!
Run away! Who needs you?

00:35:25.807 --> 00:35:28.476
I've never seen an ogre cry.

00:35:33.982 --> 00:35:35.691
I'm not crying.

00:35:35.859 --> 00:35:37.902
It's nothing to be ashamed of.
I cry all the time.

00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:40.988
Just thinking about my grandma,
or thinking about baby kittens,

00:35:41.156 --> 00:35:45.493
or my grandma kissing a baby kitten,
or a little baby grandma kitten.

00:35:46.828 --> 00:35:49.789
- That is so darn sad.
- I said, I'm not crying!

00:35:49.957 --> 00:35:51.832
Take it easy, I'm only trying to help.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.834
It's none of my business
why you're upset.

00:35:54.836 --> 00:35:56.170
By the way, why are you upset?

00:35:56.338 --> 00:35:59.215
I was tricked into signing something
I shouldn't have.

00:35:59.383 --> 00:36:01.676
You signed up for one of them
time-shares, huh?

00:36:01.843 --> 00:36:04.512
No. I signed this.

00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:07.682
You should never sign a contract
with Rumpelstiltskin!

00:36:07.849 --> 00:36:09.183
Yeah, I got that.

00:36:09.351 --> 00:36:11.352
- His fine print is crafty.
- I know.

00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:13.854
- His exit clauses are sneaky.
- Yeah, I...

00:36:14.690 --> 00:36:17.149
- What did you say?
- I'm talking about the exit clause.

00:36:17.317 --> 00:36:18.484
Used to be, you had to guess his name,

00:36:18.652 --> 00:36:20.569
but now everybody knows
who Rumpelstiltskin is.

00:36:20.737 --> 00:36:22.363
Donkey, I've read the fine print.

00:36:22.531 --> 00:36:24.865
There's nothing
about an exit clause in here.

00:36:25.033 --> 00:36:26.951
Well, you didn't expect him
to make it easy for you.

00:36:27.119 --> 00:36:29.370
Here, let me show you how it's done.

00:36:29.538 --> 00:36:31.038
I didn't spend all that time
around them witches

00:36:31.206 --> 00:36:32.873
without picking up a few tricks.

00:36:33.041 --> 00:36:35.251
Your tiny, little ogre brain
couldn't begin to comprehend

00:36:35.419 --> 00:36:37.712
the complexity
of my polygonic foldability skills.

00:36:37.879 --> 00:36:39.130
What are you doing?

00:36:39.298 --> 00:36:42.383
Hey, I can't get my origami on
unless you back off.

00:36:42.551 --> 00:36:45.845
Thank you. OK, here's what you
gotta do. You fold this piece here,

00:36:46.013 --> 00:36:48.389
make this letter match up here,
bring this corner here,

00:36:48.557 --> 00:36:52.727
and if you do it just right,
it will show you what to do. There!

00:36:52.894 --> 00:36:55.229
"Try Lou's Bliss. "

00:36:58.233 --> 00:36:59.275
Who's Lou?

00:36:59.443 --> 00:37:01.235
Give me that!

00:37:06.575 --> 00:37:08.617
"True Love's Kiss. "

00:37:10.912 --> 00:37:13.414
You have to take me to dinner first.

00:37:14.249 --> 00:37:17.418
"According to fairy tale law,
if not fully satisfied,

00:37:17.586 --> 00:37:21.088
true love's kiss will render
this contract null and void. "

00:37:21.256 --> 00:37:24.759
Donkey, you did it! Look at you!

00:37:24.926 --> 00:37:29.722
If Fiona and I share true love's kiss,
I will get my life back!

00:37:29.890 --> 00:37:32.808
OK! This isn't a petting zoo!
So where is this Fiona?

00:37:34.436 --> 00:37:35.895
Well, that's just it, you see.

00:37:36.563 --> 00:37:37.938
I don't know.

00:37:38.106 --> 00:37:40.274
You know, when I lose something,
I always try to retrace my steps.

00:37:40.442 --> 00:37:42.777
So... where did you leave her last?

00:37:43.445 --> 00:37:45.613
The last time I saw her,

00:37:45.781 --> 00:37:48.449
I told her I wished
I'd never rescued her.

00:37:50.452 --> 00:37:53.579
- Oh, no.
- Shrek?

00:37:53.747 --> 00:37:56.332
Shrek! Shrek, wait! Wait, Shrek!

00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:58.626
What, are you crazy?
That's the Dragon's Keep!

00:37:58.794 --> 00:38:00.711
They keep dragons in there!

00:38:02.589 --> 00:38:04.006
OK, yeah, fine! Go ahead!

00:38:04.174 --> 00:38:07.093
I'm gonna just hang back here
and find us some breakfast!

00:38:17.896 --> 00:38:19.146
Fiona!

00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:56.016
Oh, no.

00:39:06.945 --> 00:39:09.238
If I didn't save Fiona...

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:13.909
...then who did?

00:39:24.463 --> 00:39:29.258
This is the favour Fiona was
supposed to give me on the day we met.

00:39:30.886 --> 00:39:32.928
It's a symbol of our love.

00:39:33.763 --> 00:39:34.889
Now smell it!

00:39:35.056 --> 00:39:36.932
Hey, man, get that dirty
favour out of my face!

00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.644
Your nose is the only chance
I have of tracking down my wife,

00:39:40.812 --> 00:39:43.397
so stop complaining and start smelling.

00:39:43.565 --> 00:39:45.024
Smell it! Get it! Away you go, girl!

00:39:45.192 --> 00:39:46.901
Do I look like a bloodhound to you?

00:39:47.068 --> 00:39:49.487
In case you haven't noticed,
I'm a donkey, not a dog!

00:39:49.654 --> 00:39:52.406
If I was a dog, they'd call me Dog,
not Donkey!

00:39:52.574 --> 00:39:53.949
And another thing...

00:39:54.951 --> 00:39:56.410
Wait a minute.

00:39:57.078 --> 00:39:58.496
I think I got something.

00:39:59.122 --> 00:40:01.415
- Whatever it is, it's sweet.
- Fiona.

00:40:01.583 --> 00:40:03.209
Luscious and tasty.

00:40:03.376 --> 00:40:05.920
Hey! That's my wife
you're talking about.

00:40:07.506 --> 00:40:08.589
Donkey!

00:40:12.594 --> 00:40:14.678
Yeah! Waffles!

00:40:14.846 --> 00:40:17.806
And I thought the Waffle Fairy
was just a bedtime story.

00:40:18.350 --> 00:40:21.936
Sticky stacks of golden,
syrupy deliciousness!

00:40:22.103 --> 00:40:24.271
Donkey! Don't eat that!

00:40:24.439 --> 00:40:28.567
There's a stack of freshly made waffles
in the middle of the forest.

00:40:28.735 --> 00:40:30.611
Don't you find that
a wee bit suspicious?

00:40:31.363 --> 00:40:33.531
Oh, you... I'm just... What are you...?

00:40:33.698 --> 00:40:35.658
Bad Donkey! Mustn't.

00:40:35.825 --> 00:40:39.870
I said, don't! Don't!
No! Get away from it.

00:40:40.789 --> 00:40:41.830
You did.

00:40:48.964 --> 00:40:50.089
Look out!

00:40:53.218 --> 00:40:54.218
Donkey!

00:40:54.386 --> 00:40:56.804
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

00:40:58.974 --> 00:41:00.057
Donkey.

00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:04.144
Help! Help me!

00:41:04.312 --> 00:41:07.064
Help, Shrek! Help!

00:41:30.839 --> 00:41:32.047
Watch your head.

00:41:32.257 --> 00:41:33.591
Hey, it's a new guy!

00:41:33.758 --> 00:41:35.884
Look at him, all dressed up
in his Sunday vest.

00:41:36.052 --> 00:41:37.803
He's really tiny, isn't he?

00:41:37.971 --> 00:41:40.055
Yeah. Fate has delivered us
a comrade-in-arms

00:41:40.223 --> 00:41:41.849
and for that, we are thankful.
Suit him up!

00:41:42.017 --> 00:41:43.976
- Let's go, greenie.
- Now, wait a minute!

00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:50.774
- Hey!
- Here you go.

00:41:56.072 --> 00:41:58.866
- Welcome to the resistance.
- Resistance?

00:41:59.034 --> 00:42:02.620
We fight for freedom
and ogres everywhere!

00:42:12.088 --> 00:42:13.714
I didn't know we could do that.

00:42:13.882 --> 00:42:16.383
Help! You can't eat me! I got the mange!

00:42:16.551 --> 00:42:21.013
- I'm poisonous! I'm all poi...
- I'll take him! This order's to go.

00:42:21.181 --> 00:42:23.599
Hey! I haven't removed his giblets yet.

00:42:23.767 --> 00:42:25.934
Trust me, you don't want
to eat this one.

00:42:26.102 --> 00:42:28.145
I go down smooth,
but come out fighting!

00:42:28.313 --> 00:42:30.397
- Let go!
- Don't make Mama mad.

00:42:30.565 --> 00:42:31.649
Your dinner is my friend!

00:42:31.816 --> 00:42:33.942
- Come on, guys!
- I got to get the giblets out!

00:42:34.110 --> 00:42:36.111
- She's back.
- There she is.

00:42:53.963 --> 00:42:55.047
Fiona!

00:42:57.175 --> 00:42:59.259
I'm so happy I found you!

00:43:07.435 --> 00:43:08.811
Maybe you missed orientation,

00:43:08.978 --> 00:43:12.481
but for future reference,
personal space is very important to me.

00:43:13.775 --> 00:43:15.609
You don't know who I am, do you?

00:43:15.777 --> 00:43:17.277
No.

00:43:17.445 --> 00:43:19.446
Brogan, I have news from Far Far Away.

00:43:19.614 --> 00:43:21.782
Gather the others
and meet me in the war room.

00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:24.451
Gretched, make sure everyone
is prepared to move out tonight.

00:43:24.619 --> 00:43:26.578
- I need to talk to you.
- What is it?

00:43:26.746 --> 00:43:31.291
OK, I know you don't
remember me, but...

00:43:31.459 --> 00:43:33.544
...we're married. Hear me out.

00:43:33.712 --> 00:43:36.463
And at the birthday party
with some pigs and a puppet,

00:43:36.631 --> 00:43:38.048
the villagers wanted me
to sign their pitchforks,

00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:40.259
and this boy kept saying,
"Do the roar. "

00:43:40.427 --> 00:43:42.845
Then I punched the cakes that the
pigs ate and the next thing I knew,

00:43:43.012 --> 00:43:45.347
my donkey fell in your waffle hole.

00:43:47.892 --> 00:43:50.394
Right? Who's with me?

00:43:52.147 --> 00:43:54.773
I guess I must have kicked him
harder than I thought.

00:43:54.941 --> 00:43:57.151
Fiona, I need to...

00:43:58.653 --> 00:44:01.155
Witches! All right, everyone,
you know the drill!

00:44:01.322 --> 00:44:03.157
- Fiona!
- Witches! Oh, no!

00:44:03.324 --> 00:44:05.409
- Witches! Witches!
- Come on, now.

00:44:34.314 --> 00:44:37.107
Fiona, that's the third patrol today.
We can't hide forever.

00:44:37.275 --> 00:44:40.861
Trust me, Brogan.
After tonight, we won't have to.

00:44:42.447 --> 00:44:45.616
- That's your wife?
- That's my wife.

00:44:46.034 --> 00:44:49.077
Well, I see who wears the chain mail
in your family!

00:44:52.248 --> 00:44:57.252
Some people like to look
at the goblet as... as half empty.

00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:01.423
Me, I like to look at it as half full.

00:45:02.258 --> 00:45:05.385
We've gone from the bottom
to the top, ladies.

00:45:05.553 --> 00:45:08.680
But we're not just an empire.

00:45:09.224 --> 00:45:10.474
We're a family.

00:45:11.476 --> 00:45:15.229
Everyone has got their cupcake?
Cupcake, cupcake? Good. Yes? Baba?

00:45:15.396 --> 00:45:16.396
Good.

00:45:16.564 --> 00:45:19.775
Yeah, you know, we have
put away a lot of ogres.

00:45:19.943 --> 00:45:24.112
And so one got away.
Who cares? It's not a big deal.

00:45:24.614 --> 00:45:26.698
It doesn't matter to me.

00:45:26.866 --> 00:45:29.618
It's not like it's the end of the world.

00:45:30.787 --> 00:45:33.705
Except... funny thing.

00:45:33.873 --> 00:45:37.376
Now that I think about it,
the ogre who got away is Shrek!

00:45:37.544 --> 00:45:40.379
And if he shares a kiss
with Fiona by sunrise,

00:45:40.547 --> 00:45:43.715
it is the end of the world! Our world!

00:45:43.883 --> 00:45:45.759
My empire!

00:45:49.305 --> 00:45:51.765
But, as I was saying,

00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:55.978
I like to look at the goblet
as half full.

00:45:57.438 --> 00:45:59.439
Yelling makes me so parched.

00:45:59.607 --> 00:46:03.443
Would anyone care for some water?
Wet your whistle?

00:46:03.611 --> 00:46:06.488
A clear, crisp, delicious glass...

00:46:06.656 --> 00:46:09.825
...of agua purificada?

00:46:09.993 --> 00:46:12.327
Anybody's thirsty?
Nobody's thirsty? No?

00:46:13.329 --> 00:46:15.330
Well, then does anyone care to tell me

00:46:15.498 --> 00:46:18.125
what it's going to take
to get this ogre? You.

00:46:18.293 --> 00:46:19.418
Faster brooms?

00:46:19.586 --> 00:46:21.169
- No!
- Pointier hats?

00:46:21.337 --> 00:46:22.963
- No! You!
- Maybe we could hire

00:46:23.131 --> 00:46:24.840
a professional bounty hunter?

00:46:25.884 --> 00:46:28.844
What a world! What a world!

00:46:30.471 --> 00:46:33.390
You know, actually
not a bad idea. Baba!

00:46:34.017 --> 00:46:35.642
I need a bounty hunter.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.979
And if music doth
soothe the savage beast...

00:46:39.147 --> 00:46:42.357
...then I think I might know
just the person!

00:46:44.694 --> 00:46:48.947
Listen up, everyone.
Word has come from Far Far Away.

00:46:49.115 --> 00:46:52.284
Stiltskin is leading
tonight's ogre hunt himself.

00:46:52.452 --> 00:46:54.161
- He's never done that before.
- What? Why?

00:46:54.329 --> 00:46:56.163
I bet that's because of us.

00:46:56.331 --> 00:46:58.081
If that cupcake-eating clown

00:46:58.249 --> 00:47:01.376
finally leaves the safety
of his filthy witch nest...

00:47:02.045 --> 00:47:03.337
...he'll be vulnerable.

00:47:03.504 --> 00:47:06.673
The plan's simple.
If they follow the usual patrol route,

00:47:06.841 --> 00:47:08.967
they'll reach the river by midnight.

00:47:09.135 --> 00:47:12.638
We'll be concealed along this road,
waiting for his caravan.

00:47:12.805 --> 00:47:16.141
Once they reach the clearing,
I'll give the signal.

00:47:16.309 --> 00:47:18.185
And then we attack!

00:47:23.942 --> 00:47:27.194
And when the smoke clears...
Wait, what's this?

00:47:27.362 --> 00:47:28.654
That's my chimichanga stand.

00:47:29.739 --> 00:47:31.907
No, Cookie. We won't be needing that.

00:47:32.075 --> 00:47:35.786
Trust me, Fiona. Y'all gonna be
really hungry after this ambush, OK?

00:47:36.704 --> 00:47:38.497
Go and finish your little speech.

00:47:39.248 --> 00:47:42.709
All right, as I was saying,
when the smoke clears,

00:47:42.877 --> 00:47:46.588
Rumpelstiltskin is gone
and the chimichangas have been eaten.

00:47:46.756 --> 00:47:49.383
Far Far Away will finally be free.

00:47:49.550 --> 00:47:51.301
- And so will we.
- Spread the word.

00:47:51.469 --> 00:47:54.721
We move out as soon as
Rumpel leaves the palace.

00:47:57.058 --> 00:47:59.267
- Man, this is serious!
- Tell me about it.

00:47:59.435 --> 00:48:02.020
How am I ever gonna
get her to kiss me before sunrise?

00:48:02.188 --> 00:48:03.730
Actually, I was talking
about the revolution.

00:48:03.898 --> 00:48:05.399
Revolution?

00:48:05.566 --> 00:48:07.484
Why don't you just
tell her what you told me?

00:48:07.652 --> 00:48:10.278
About how you're her true love and
you came from an alternate universe.

00:48:10.446 --> 00:48:12.239
Well, while I'm at it,
why don't I tell her

00:48:12.407 --> 00:48:14.408
that you're married
to a fire-breathing dragon

00:48:14.575 --> 00:48:17.619
and you have little, mutant
donkey-dragon babies.

00:48:18.121 --> 00:48:19.287
I do?!

00:48:19.455 --> 00:48:22.374
You saw what happened.
She's gonna think I'm crazy.

00:48:22.542 --> 00:48:23.750
I'm a daddy?

00:48:23.918 --> 00:48:27.295
You know what?
If I got Fiona to kiss me once...

00:48:29.298 --> 00:48:31.091
...then I can do it again.

00:48:31.968 --> 00:48:34.177
Shrek, do my babies
have hooves or talons?

00:48:34.345 --> 00:48:35.929
Donkey...!

00:48:36.097 --> 00:48:37.514
Hello?

00:48:38.975 --> 00:48:40.142
Fiona?

00:48:46.149 --> 00:48:49.234
You should not be here, senor.

00:48:49.402 --> 00:48:50.777
Puss?

00:48:56.284 --> 00:48:57.993
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:49:11.841 --> 00:49:14.301
Feed me, if you dare.

00:49:14.469 --> 00:49:17.804
Puss, what happened to you?
You got so fa...

00:49:19.182 --> 00:49:22.184
- ... fancy.
- Do I know you?

00:49:22.351 --> 00:49:24.936
Well, where's your hat?
Where's your belt?

00:49:25.104 --> 00:49:26.855
Your wee little boots?

00:49:27.023 --> 00:49:29.483
Boots? For a cat? Ha!

00:49:29.650 --> 00:49:32.736
But you're Puss in Boots.

00:49:33.362 --> 00:49:34.946
Maybe once.

00:49:35.114 --> 00:49:36.656
But that is a name I have outgrown.

00:49:36.824 --> 00:49:38.492
That's not the only thing
you've outgrown.

00:49:38.659 --> 00:49:42.746
Hey! I may have let myself go
a little since retirement,

00:49:42.914 --> 00:49:45.499
but hanging up my sword
was the best decision of my life.

00:49:45.666 --> 00:49:48.710
I have all the cream I can drink
and all the mice I can chase.

00:49:50.338 --> 00:49:51.713
I'll get him later.

00:49:51.881 --> 00:49:54.299
Puss, what have I done to you?

00:49:54.467 --> 00:49:55.926
You've gone soft.

00:49:56.719 --> 00:50:00.889
Well, I do get brushed twice a day.

00:50:02.058 --> 00:50:03.683
Look, it's not too late to fix it.

00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:06.103
All you have to do is help me
get a kiss from Fiona.

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:09.397
What are you doing?
Can I help you with something?

00:50:09.565 --> 00:50:12.526
Well, I know how stressful
mounting a rebellion can be...

00:50:12.693 --> 00:50:14.694
...rallying the troops,
planning attacks,

00:50:14.862 --> 00:50:18.657
so I brought you a little something
to ease the tension.

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.283
A gift basket?

00:50:20.451 --> 00:50:23.078
You're welcome.
So let's see what you got.

00:50:23.246 --> 00:50:25.622
Heart-shaped box of slugs.

00:50:26.249 --> 00:50:28.708
Skunk-scented candle.

00:50:28.876 --> 00:50:33.255
- Look, this really isn't the...
- What's this? Coupons!

00:50:33.422 --> 00:50:35.465
Let's see,
"Good for one free foot massage. "

00:50:35.633 --> 00:50:37.968
"A mud facial!"
Oh, and here's one...

00:50:38.136 --> 00:50:41.680
"Good for one free kiss. "
Let's cash it now.

00:50:41.848 --> 00:50:43.849
Look, I don't know
what this is all about,

00:50:44.016 --> 00:50:45.559
but I'm trying to run a revolution.

00:50:45.726 --> 00:50:47.936
So unless you have
Rumpelstiltskin's head in there,

00:50:48.104 --> 00:50:50.230
I suggest you take your gift basket,

00:50:50.398 --> 00:50:54.109
get out of my tent
and go make yourself useful!

00:50:54.777 --> 00:50:59.072
Wow. You're right. I am sorry.

00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.284
I was just trying to be friendly.
No hard feelings?

00:51:03.911 --> 00:51:04.953
An apologetic hug?

00:51:06.164 --> 00:51:07.455
And a quick kiss goodbye.

00:51:08.958 --> 00:51:09.958
Hey!

00:51:10.585 --> 00:51:12.752
Wait! Is that mistletoe I see?

00:51:14.463 --> 00:51:17.841
Hey, Shrek! Are my babies cute, or do
they make people feel uncomfortable?

00:51:18.009 --> 00:51:21.136
- Where'd we find that guy?
- Could it be true?

00:51:21.304 --> 00:51:25.515
Have the years of prim
and pampery made me soft?

00:51:25.683 --> 00:51:28.602
Don't be silly.
Now who's a pretty kitty?

00:51:28.769 --> 00:51:30.353
I am.

00:51:38.154 --> 00:51:40.697
Daddy thinks you look real nice, Fifi.

00:51:41.991 --> 00:51:43.033
Honk.

00:51:43.201 --> 00:51:44.784
All right, Piggies, be gone!

00:51:44.952 --> 00:51:47.162
Don't forget to take
her little potty box with you.

00:51:48.122 --> 00:51:50.081
This little piggy wants to go home!

00:51:50.249 --> 00:51:53.543
- Mr Stiltskin! He's here.
- Nice.

00:52:07.308 --> 00:52:10.477
Pied Piper. How was your commute?

00:52:12.563 --> 00:52:13.647
Good.

00:52:13.814 --> 00:52:15.565
You call this guy a bounty hunter?

00:52:15.733 --> 00:52:18.610
What's he gonna do,
flute those ogres a lullaby?

00:52:30.581 --> 00:52:32.207
OK, got it!

00:52:33.417 --> 00:52:35.543
Make it stop!

00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.216
All right, that's enough.

00:52:44.553 --> 00:52:48.223
Looks like it's time to pay the piper.

00:52:50.393 --> 00:52:53.144
Griselda, seriously,
it's time to pay the piper.

00:52:53.312 --> 00:52:56.356
Now go get my chequebook!
Go! Move! Get out!

00:52:56.524 --> 00:52:58.525
Things are getting
real sloppy around here!

00:53:01.779 --> 00:53:03.680
Here, now make sure they eat up!

00:53:03.848 --> 00:53:07.242
You can't end tyranny on
an empty stomach! Go on! Go!

00:53:07.410 --> 00:53:08.910
Din-din!

00:53:16.669 --> 00:53:19.546
- Come on, Donkey.
- One more time, please?

00:53:19.714 --> 00:53:22.007
All right, but this is the last time.

00:53:23.592 --> 00:53:24.592
Here it comes. Look at him.

00:53:29.932 --> 00:53:31.766
I see you!

00:53:38.691 --> 00:53:40.567
That's quite a friend you've got there.

00:53:40.735 --> 00:53:42.861
I can see why you haven't eaten him.

00:53:43.029 --> 00:53:45.655
Donkey! I hate to pull you away
from your adoring public,

00:53:45.823 --> 00:53:48.116
but I'm not getting anywhere with Fiona.

00:53:48.284 --> 00:53:51.369
- I need your help!
- Hey, everybody. Who wants dessert?

00:53:54.165 --> 00:53:56.207
- Where'd you get these?
- Fiona's garbage.

00:53:56.375 --> 00:53:59.294
Just another gift from some
clueless lover boy.

00:54:01.088 --> 00:54:02.756
That's a good one, Cookie!

00:54:03.758 --> 00:54:06.760
Anyone who knows Fiona knows
this stuff ain't gonna work on her.

00:54:06.927 --> 00:54:08.428
Works on me.

00:54:08.596 --> 00:54:11.473
Donkey, what am I gonna do?
It's like I don't even know her.

00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:15.018
You in trouble, Romeo. The only thing
Fiona cares about is her cause.

00:54:15.186 --> 00:54:18.188
- To the cause!
- To the cause!

00:54:20.358 --> 00:54:21.524
All right!

00:54:44.006 --> 00:54:45.006
Hello!

00:54:49.011 --> 00:54:51.096
- Nice moves.
- What are you doing?

00:54:51.263 --> 00:54:53.973
What does it look like?
I'm getting ready for ambush action.

00:54:54.141 --> 00:54:56.810
Oh, yeah.
I always like to quad my lutes

00:54:56.977 --> 00:55:01.147
and do some scrunches
before an operational... op.

00:55:01.315 --> 00:55:02.357
This one taken?

00:55:02.525 --> 00:55:04.359
We use that to clean the toilets.

00:55:06.278 --> 00:55:09.406
And we use that one to clean
the thing we clean the toilets with.

00:55:09.573 --> 00:55:10.865
I knew that.

00:55:11.951 --> 00:55:13.076
There you go, chief.

00:55:30.219 --> 00:55:32.387
Hey... Scott?

00:55:32.888 --> 00:55:34.722
My name is Shrek, actually.

00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:37.725
You're going to get yourself killed
at the ambush tonight.

00:55:37.893 --> 00:55:41.521
I'll be fine.
I think I can take care of myself...

00:55:42.022 --> 00:55:43.273
Well, let's see about that.

00:55:43.691 --> 00:55:46.151
Hey! Hey... Hey!

00:55:46.318 --> 00:55:47.360
What the...?

00:55:52.074 --> 00:55:53.408
Fiona?

00:56:25.983 --> 00:56:27.275
I got it.

00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.943
Give me your hand.

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.989
The dragon goes under the bridge,

00:56:33.157 --> 00:56:35.408
through the loop and finally...

00:56:35.576 --> 00:56:37.160
Into the castle.

00:56:45.794 --> 00:56:47.128
Wow.

00:56:48.839 --> 00:56:50.965
OK. Good.

00:56:51.592 --> 00:56:53.301
It seems like you can handle yourself.

00:56:53.469 --> 00:56:55.428
- But, Fiona...
- Go get ready for the mission!

00:56:55.596 --> 00:56:58.598
- I will, but Fiona...
- That's an order!

00:57:09.693 --> 00:57:13.112
All right, let's get those axes
sharpened and weapons packed!

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.864
Preparation is half the battle!

00:57:16.033 --> 00:57:20.495
Ogre! Un momento! Un momento!

00:57:20.996 --> 00:57:23.540
Ogre, ogre, un momento!

00:57:25.167 --> 00:57:26.459
Just give me a minute.

00:57:26.627 --> 00:57:29.462
Look, Puss, I'm a little
pressed for time.

00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:32.799
I am not believing
what I have just witnessed.

00:57:32.967 --> 00:57:34.634
Back there, you and Fiona.

00:57:34.802 --> 00:57:37.470
There was a spark...
a spark inside her heart

00:57:37.638 --> 00:57:39.347
I thought was long extinguished.

00:57:39.515 --> 00:57:43.935
It was as if, for one moment,
Fiona had actually found her true love!

00:57:44.103 --> 00:57:47.438
I am her true love. I ended her curse.

00:57:48.023 --> 00:57:49.857
You know of her curse?

00:57:50.025 --> 00:57:53.319
By day, one way, by night another.

00:57:53.487 --> 00:57:56.239
This shall be the norm.

00:57:56.407 --> 00:57:59.909
Until you find true love's first kiss...

00:58:01.203 --> 00:58:05.081
...and then take love's true form.

00:58:05.958 --> 00:58:07.834
You even know the little rhyme!

00:58:08.002 --> 00:58:10.503
It is true! You are the one!
You must prove it to her!

00:58:10.671 --> 00:58:12.839
- How?
- Convince her!

00:58:13.007 --> 00:58:14.340
Go to her when she is alone

00:58:14.508 --> 00:58:18.177
and tell her something
that only her true love would know.

00:58:18.345 --> 00:58:19.887
Know about what?!

00:58:21.890 --> 00:58:25.018
Whoa! That's a whole lot of kitty!
Shrek, can we keep him?

00:58:41.744 --> 00:58:43.578
Excuse me. Coming through!

00:58:43.746 --> 00:58:46.456
Pardon me, guys! Watch your back.

00:58:46.624 --> 00:58:49.500
Look, Donkey,
the chimichanga cart! Quick!

00:58:49.668 --> 00:58:52.545
�ndale! After him, burro!
Donkey, v�monos!

00:58:52.713 --> 00:58:54.839
Man, you are a cat-astrophe!

00:58:55.007 --> 00:58:57.383
And you are ri-donkey-lous!

00:59:03.265 --> 00:59:06.059
I'll scout ahead. Wait for my signal.

00:59:11.106 --> 00:59:12.982
Secure your positions!

00:59:29.333 --> 00:59:31.876
- It's quite a view from up here.
- What are you doing?!

00:59:32.044 --> 00:59:33.086
Get back in position!

00:59:33.253 --> 00:59:36.339
You need to know,
once and for all, who I really am.

00:59:36.507 --> 00:59:37.965
You are going to ruin everything!

00:59:38.133 --> 00:59:40.385
Ruin everything?
Actually, I'm gonna fix everything...

00:59:40.552 --> 00:59:43.262
The ogres, Rumpel, your curse.

00:59:44.848 --> 00:59:46.516
How do you know about my curse?!

00:59:46.684 --> 00:59:51.104
OK, OK, please, Fiona...
Just hear me out.

00:59:51.271 --> 00:59:53.815
I can explain everything.

00:59:57.319 --> 01:00:00.113
- Where's Fiona's signal?
- What's she waiting for?

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.116
- He's going to get away!
- No, he's not.

01:00:28.684 --> 01:00:32.478
Listen, I don't know who you are
or how you know about my curse,

01:00:32.646 --> 01:00:34.522
but if any of these ogres
find out I'm...

01:00:34.690 --> 01:00:37.942
- A beautiful princess?
- That is not who I am! Not anymore.

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:41.154
- Look, I know you're upset.
- You don't know anything about me.

01:00:41.321 --> 01:00:42.989
I know everything about you.

01:00:43.157 --> 01:00:46.159
I know you sing so beautifully
that birds explode.

01:00:46.326 --> 01:00:48.494
- Big deal.
- I know that when you sign your name,

01:00:48.662 --> 01:00:51.330
- you put a heart over the "I".
- So what?

01:00:51.498 --> 01:00:53.499
I know that when
you see a shooting star,

01:00:53.667 --> 01:00:55.668
you cross your fingers on both hands,

01:00:55.836 --> 01:00:59.630
squinch up your nose
and you make a wish.

01:00:59.798 --> 01:01:02.675
I know that you don't like the covers
wrapped around your feet,

01:01:02.843 --> 01:01:04.510
and I know that you sleep by candlelight

01:01:04.678 --> 01:01:06.679
because every time
you close your eyes...

01:01:07.723 --> 01:01:10.725
...you're afraid you're gonna
wake up back in that tower.

01:01:12.436 --> 01:01:14.562
But, most importantly, Fiona...

01:01:15.564 --> 01:01:19.150
...I know that the reason
you turn human every day...

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.529
...is because you've
never been kissed...

01:01:24.948 --> 01:01:26.073
...well...

01:01:28.577 --> 01:01:29.744
...by me.

01:01:39.296 --> 01:01:43.216
- You move fast.
- It's not me doing the moving.

01:01:45.219 --> 01:01:47.386
- Why is this happening?!
- Love?

01:01:47.554 --> 01:01:50.681
- No, I'm being forced to dance!
- By love!

01:01:50.849 --> 01:01:53.601
No, I can't stop myself!

01:01:53.769 --> 01:01:56.604
Please! Make it stop!

01:01:56.772 --> 01:01:58.940
I can't control myself!

01:02:02.778 --> 01:02:05.905
Yeah! Cookie's bringing
the heat out of the kitchen!

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.618
Oh, no! It's the Piper!

01:02:12.788 --> 01:02:16.415
I can't believe I let this happen,
and it's all because of you!

01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:21.003
- If you'd just let me kiss you!
- What? You're insane!

01:02:35.936 --> 01:02:40.022
We must do something before
they fandango themselves into oblivion!

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:43.609
- What can we do?
- First, you must stop dancing!

01:02:43.777 --> 01:02:46.487
When somebody tooties that flutey,
I got to shake my booty!

01:02:46.655 --> 01:02:48.281
Then it's up to me!

01:02:56.832 --> 01:03:00.668
Hurry! We must get them
away from the music!

01:03:03.005 --> 01:03:06.090
Puss and Donkey to the rescue!
We saved the day!

01:03:31.783 --> 01:03:34.285
Donkey... Can I borrow your tongue?

01:03:34.453 --> 01:03:35.536
Say what?!

01:03:36.496 --> 01:03:37.830
No. Hell...

01:03:40.292 --> 01:03:43.336
I don't care how big your eyes get,
player, it's not going down.

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:50.176
All right!

01:03:50.677 --> 01:03:51.677
Stop!

01:03:51.845 --> 01:03:54.347
- Where are you going?
- To save my friends.

01:03:54.514 --> 01:03:57.350
- How, by getting yourself killed?
- If that's what it takes.

01:03:57.517 --> 01:03:58.809
Puss, say something.

01:03:58.977 --> 01:04:00.853
- Puss?
- Let me explain.

01:04:01.021 --> 01:04:03.147
That's how you knew so much about me.

01:04:03.315 --> 01:04:06.400
- Fiona, wait! Kiss me.
- What?

01:04:06.568 --> 01:04:08.194
It's the only way to save your friends.

01:04:08.362 --> 01:04:09.320
Get out of my way.

01:04:09.488 --> 01:04:12.698
You used to believe that a single kiss
could solve everything!

01:04:39.309 --> 01:04:43.521
I don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

01:04:43.689 --> 01:04:46.315
True love's kiss
was supposed to fix everything!

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:48.567
Yeah, you know,
that's what they told me, too.

01:04:48.735 --> 01:04:51.070
True love didn't get me
out of that tower.

01:04:51.238 --> 01:04:53.948
I did. I saved myself.

01:04:55.117 --> 01:04:58.577
Don't you get it?
It's all just a big fairy tale.

01:04:58.745 --> 01:05:01.163
Fiona, don't say that. It does exist!

01:05:01.331 --> 01:05:02.707
How would you know?

01:05:02.874 --> 01:05:05.584
Did you grow up locked away
in a dragon's keep?

01:05:05.752 --> 01:05:08.587
Did you live all alone
in a miserable tower?

01:05:08.755 --> 01:05:11.090
Did you cry yourself
to sleep every night,

01:05:11.258 --> 01:05:13.843
waiting for a true love
that never came?!

01:05:15.137 --> 01:05:18.723
But... But I'm your true love.

01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:22.309
Then where were you
when I needed you?

01:05:34.156 --> 01:05:36.657
Maybe you kissed her wrong?

01:05:37.284 --> 01:05:38.325
No.

01:05:38.869 --> 01:05:40.661
The kiss didn't work...

01:05:41.621 --> 01:05:43.956
...because Fiona doesn't love me.

01:05:50.505 --> 01:05:52.214
Don't despair, fellow ogres!

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:56.635
They can put us in cages,
but they can't cage our honour!

01:05:58.013 --> 01:06:00.931
Shrek and Fiona are together?!

01:06:03.018 --> 01:06:06.270
Yeah, I've heard enough of
your toot-a-lee-toots! You blew it!

01:06:06.438 --> 01:06:08.105
Wolfie! My speech wig.

01:06:08.273 --> 01:06:12.526
Baba! Ready my makeup.
And Piper, pull my socks up.

01:06:14.988 --> 01:06:15.946
Tight.

01:06:16.114 --> 01:06:17.615
Attention, citizens.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:22.703
Please stay tuned for a message
from our tyrannical dictator!

01:06:24.081 --> 01:06:27.500
Hello, people.
It is I, Rumpelstiltskin...

01:06:27.667 --> 01:06:29.752
...shepherd of your dreams.

01:06:31.588 --> 01:06:34.548
Recently, a certain somebody

01:06:34.716 --> 01:06:38.052
has jeopardized our joyous lives.

01:06:39.012 --> 01:06:43.974
And that somebody
is the rat-munching ogre called Shrek!

01:06:44.142 --> 01:06:46.435
That is why I come to you,
dear citizens.

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:49.105
For whomever brings me this ogre,

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:53.567
shall receive the deal of a lifetime.

01:06:53.944 --> 01:06:55.361
Just think of it! Total and

01:06:55.529 --> 01:06:57.238
- complete happiness.
- Ya!

01:06:57.405 --> 01:07:00.866
Dazzling, radiant fulfilment!
All your greatest wishes.

01:07:01.034 --> 01:07:03.035
- Yeah!
- Your wildest dreams.

01:07:03.203 --> 01:07:07.832
Anything you could ever want!
No strings attached!

01:07:08.125 --> 01:07:11.210
But hurry, this is a limited time offer.

01:07:11.378 --> 01:07:17.216
So light your torches, sharpen
your pitchforks and get your mob on!

01:07:17.717 --> 01:07:20.761
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

01:07:25.016 --> 01:07:27.059
Go back where you came from!

01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:31.856
It seems that we are safe.

01:07:32.023 --> 01:07:34.817
Yeah, it looks a lot less pitchforky
and torchy out there. Let's go.

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:39.071
What's the point?
The kiss didn't work. It's over.

01:07:39.239 --> 01:07:42.241
Look, Shrek, I know things
might seem a little bleak right now,

01:07:42.409 --> 01:07:44.869
but things always work themselves
out in the end, you'll see.

01:07:45.036 --> 01:07:47.413
- I bet by this time tomorrow...
- Don't you understand?

01:07:47.581 --> 01:07:49.248
There is no tomorrow.

01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:53.377
There's no day after that, and there's
no day after that day after that!

01:07:53.545 --> 01:07:57.047
My life was perfect
and I'm never going to get it back!

01:07:57.215 --> 01:08:00.801
If your life was so perfect, why'd you
sign it away to Rumpelstiltskin?

01:08:00.969 --> 01:08:04.346
Because I didn't know
what I had until it was gone! All right?

01:08:09.144 --> 01:08:10.978
I didn't know what I had.

01:08:13.565 --> 01:08:17.067
Surrender now! I'm taking you in!

01:08:17.652 --> 01:08:21.238
Don't try to fight it, ogre!
The reward is mine!

01:08:21.406 --> 01:08:22.406
Gingy?

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.618
- You unhand me, green devil!
- What are you doing?

01:08:25.785 --> 01:08:27.077
Collecting my bounty!

01:08:27.245 --> 01:08:29.246
- Bounty?
- What are you talking about, cracker?

01:08:29.998 --> 01:08:32.458
Rumpelstiltskin promised
the deal of a lifetime

01:08:32.626 --> 01:08:35.628
- for whoever could bring you in.
- Deal of a lifetime?

01:08:35.795 --> 01:08:38.839
Where all your wishes come true.

01:08:40.508 --> 01:08:41.842
Wait a minute.

01:08:42.636 --> 01:08:45.346
- I can still fix this.
- How you gonna do that?

01:08:45.513 --> 01:08:49.808
You know what? I'm gonna give
Rumpelstiltskin exactly what he wants.

01:08:49.976 --> 01:08:52.311
OK, Gingy, tell me about this...

01:08:56.691 --> 01:08:58.692
Were you going to eat that?

01:09:00.695 --> 01:09:03.781
Not Shrek. That is not Shrek.
Also not Shrek.

01:09:03.949 --> 01:09:07.284
That's not even an ogre,
it is a troll! Nice try.

01:09:07.452 --> 01:09:08.452
- And that...
- Roar.

01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:09.620
...is just sad.

01:09:10.497 --> 01:09:12.373
And what is that supposed to be?

01:09:12.540 --> 01:09:14.124
I'm just a frightened old man.

01:09:14.292 --> 01:09:17.211
Don't listen to him!
These ogres are crafty!

01:09:17.379 --> 01:09:19.004
That is your father painted green.

01:09:19.172 --> 01:09:21.215
No, it's Shrek! Honest!

01:09:22.759 --> 01:09:23.801
Take them away!

01:09:23.969 --> 01:09:26.845
Can no one bring me Shrek?!
Where is he?

01:09:27.013 --> 01:09:29.723
How hard can it be?!
I want him! I want him! I want him!

01:09:30.225 --> 01:09:31.558
Stiltskin!

01:09:33.144 --> 01:09:34.853
I hear you're looking for me.

01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:37.648
All right! Finally!

01:09:37.816 --> 01:09:41.277
Who turned him in?
Who gets the deal of a lifetime?

01:09:41.444 --> 01:09:43.279
- I do.
- What? But...

01:09:43.446 --> 01:09:47.366
If I'm turning myself in,
I get the deal of a lifetime.

01:09:50.370 --> 01:09:54.123
That means you have
to give me anything I want.

01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:56.875
No! Only true love's kiss
can break your contract!

01:09:57.043 --> 01:09:58.919
So if you thought you were just gonna...

01:09:59.963 --> 01:10:04.216
- ... in here and get your life back...
- I'm not here to get my life back.

01:10:04.759 --> 01:10:07.177
Then what do you want?

01:10:17.939 --> 01:10:20.441
The ogres. They are all free.

01:10:20.608 --> 01:10:22.109
But where is Shrek?

01:10:27.282 --> 01:10:29.616
This is not good.

01:10:30.744 --> 01:10:34.246
I don't know.
Not much of a storybook ending.

01:10:34.414 --> 01:10:40.252
The noble Shrek turns himself in
to save a bunch of filthy ogres.

01:10:40.795 --> 01:10:43.464
All that matters is that they're free...

01:10:43.965 --> 01:10:45.966
...and Fiona is safe.

01:10:47.469 --> 01:10:50.429
I bet Fiona would be
really touched to hear that.

01:10:51.097 --> 01:10:52.389
But, hey...

01:10:52.557 --> 01:10:55.476
...I guess you can tell her yourself.

01:10:56.311 --> 01:10:57.770
Fiona!

01:11:06.154 --> 01:11:10.449
Stiltskin, we had a deal!
You agreed to free all ogres!

01:11:10.617 --> 01:11:11.867
Oh, yeah.

01:11:12.035 --> 01:11:16.663
But Fiona isn't all ogre, is she?

01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:25.464
By day, one way, by night, another.
Blardy, blardy, blar.

01:11:27.342 --> 01:11:29.551
Nobody's smart but me!

01:11:37.685 --> 01:11:40.187
That was a really brave thing
you did, Shrek.

01:11:40.980 --> 01:11:41.980
Thank you.

01:11:42.690 --> 01:11:45.025
No, you were right.

01:11:45.860 --> 01:11:47.986
I wasn't there for you.

01:11:48.154 --> 01:11:50.489
And not just at
the Dragon's Keep, but...

01:11:51.825 --> 01:11:53.575
...every day since.

01:11:54.536 --> 01:11:55.702
Well...

01:11:56.704 --> 01:11:58.330
...you're here now.

01:12:01.042 --> 01:12:02.835
Let go of me! I have got to save Shrek!

01:12:03.002 --> 01:12:04.378
Don't be a fool, mule!

01:12:04.546 --> 01:12:07.047
She's right. Rumpel's palace
is locked up tighter

01:12:07.215 --> 01:12:10.509
- than Old Mother Hubbard's Cupboard.
- And that cupboard wasn't guarded

01:12:10.677 --> 01:12:13.679
by a whole bunch of
mean, ugly, nasty witches.

01:12:13.847 --> 01:12:16.723
Hey! We can hear you!

01:12:17.559 --> 01:12:19.059
Sorry!

01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:22.354
We must get into the palace.

01:12:22.522 --> 01:12:24.648
Man, Shrek and me
just busted out of that place!

01:12:24.816 --> 01:12:26.358
But how?

01:12:27.569 --> 01:12:30.529
The same way we're gonna bust in.

01:12:34.993 --> 01:12:39.121
Yay! My new pretty ball!
Didn't it look bigger in the catalogue?

01:12:39.289 --> 01:12:40.873
I guess it'll have to do.

01:12:46.337 --> 01:12:51.049
Witches, finally, the moment
we've all been waiting for.

01:12:51.217 --> 01:12:54.011
The main event of the evening!

01:12:54.179 --> 01:12:57.347
I present Shrek and Fiona!

01:13:02.437 --> 01:13:06.482
And now, to put the past
behind us once and for all,

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:10.402
I give you a princess's worst nightmare!

01:13:10.570 --> 01:13:14.156
Fiona's old flame,
the keeper of the keep...

01:13:14.324 --> 01:13:15.908
...Dragon!

01:13:38.890 --> 01:13:41.183
- Donkey?
- And Puss!

01:13:44.979 --> 01:13:46.104
In Boots!

01:14:16.219 --> 01:14:18.262
Get them, get them, witches!

01:14:20.098 --> 01:14:21.640
Incoming!

01:14:25.853 --> 01:14:28.230
- Donkey, woo her!
- Woo who?

01:14:28.398 --> 01:14:29.773
Your wife!

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:54.965
Uh-oh.

01:15:00.471 --> 01:15:03.765
I'll call you! We're in love!

01:15:15.528 --> 01:15:16.987
Fiona, hold on!

01:15:18.698 --> 01:15:20.324
Hey, you!

01:15:49.854 --> 01:15:52.939
- Chimichangas?!
- Get 'em while they're hot!

01:15:59.864 --> 01:16:01.073
Jump!

01:16:04.535 --> 01:16:05.744
Now!

01:16:19.801 --> 01:16:22.427
The dragon goes under the bridge!

01:16:23.554 --> 01:16:25.055
Through the loop!

01:16:25.223 --> 01:16:26.306
And finally...

01:16:26.474 --> 01:16:28.058
Into the castle!

01:16:34.732 --> 01:16:36.108
Run!

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:43.573
Foo!

01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:46.743
So long!

01:16:49.622 --> 01:16:50.747
Come on, Fifi, go!

01:16:50.915 --> 01:16:52.791
Go! Witches, close up the floor!

01:16:53.918 --> 01:16:56.545
Come on, Fifi, go! Flappity flap!

01:16:56.713 --> 01:17:00.090
Come on, go! Fly away! Up, up! Go!

01:17:00.925 --> 01:17:02.259
Fifi, no!

01:17:07.014 --> 01:17:08.932
Victory is ours!

01:17:17.316 --> 01:17:20.318
Looks like we're having
curly-toed weirdo for breakfast.

01:17:20.486 --> 01:17:23.071
Hey, we make a pretty good team.

01:17:23.239 --> 01:17:25.198
You have no idea.

01:17:33.124 --> 01:17:34.458
Shrek?

01:17:37.253 --> 01:17:40.130
His day is up. His day is...!

01:17:40.715 --> 01:17:41.882
Shrek?

01:17:42.967 --> 01:17:44.634
It's all right.

01:17:48.181 --> 01:17:50.474
There has to be something I can do.

01:17:51.309 --> 01:17:54.936
You've already done
everything for me, Fiona.

01:17:55.104 --> 01:17:57.689
You gave me a home and a family.

01:17:57.857 --> 01:17:59.608
You have kids?

01:17:59.776 --> 01:18:01.777
We have kids.

01:18:01.944 --> 01:18:05.822
Fergus, Farkle
and a little girl named...

01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:07.324
- ... Felicia.
- Felicia.

01:18:08.201 --> 01:18:10.994
I always wanted to have
a daughter named Felicia.

01:18:11.537 --> 01:18:13.205
And someday...

01:18:14.874 --> 01:18:16.208
...you will.

01:18:26.886 --> 01:18:29.554
You know what the
best part of today was?

01:18:32.183 --> 01:18:36.353
I got the chance to fall in love
with you all over again.

01:19:10.263 --> 01:19:13.098
Fiona, the sunrise!

01:19:13.266 --> 01:19:15.559
You're still... an ogre!

01:19:18.062 --> 01:19:21.022
- True love's form.
- Impossible!

01:19:21.774 --> 01:19:23.441
The kiss worked.

01:19:30.116 --> 01:19:31.449
What?!

01:19:40.877 --> 01:19:42.294
Fifi!

01:19:44.088 --> 01:19:45.422
Puss!

01:19:47.758 --> 01:19:49.509
No, no, no!

01:19:49.677 --> 01:19:52.762
No, not yet! I'm not ready! No, wait!

01:20:06.903 --> 01:20:08.361
I love you, Daddy!

01:20:08.529 --> 01:20:11.781
Shrek! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!

01:20:16.203 --> 01:20:19.414
Everybody, I have found another cake!

01:20:20.166 --> 01:20:22.459
Shrek? Are you OK?

01:20:28.966 --> 01:20:33.136
Fiona. I've never been better.

01:20:35.306 --> 01:20:36.973
Roar!

01:20:41.812 --> 01:20:44.147
Happy Birthday, Farkle.

01:20:44.315 --> 01:20:46.608
Fergus, my little man!

01:20:46.776 --> 01:20:49.069
And Felicia, sweetheart.

01:20:49.236 --> 01:20:51.488
I believe this is yours.

01:20:52.865 --> 01:20:54.532
Thank you, Daddy.

01:20:56.035 --> 01:20:58.536
Hey, Uncle Shrek! How about
giving my babies an encore!

01:20:58.704 --> 01:21:00.830
Please, se�or, let us have it!

01:21:12.134 --> 01:21:15.595
- I didn't know we could do that.
- That's my best friend!

01:21:16.847 --> 01:21:19.015
You know, I always thought

01:21:19.183 --> 01:21:21.559
that I rescued you
from the Dragon's Keep.

01:21:21.727 --> 01:21:23.103
You did.

01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:26.856
No. It was you that rescued me.

01:22:57.948 --> 01:22:59.282
Yummy!
