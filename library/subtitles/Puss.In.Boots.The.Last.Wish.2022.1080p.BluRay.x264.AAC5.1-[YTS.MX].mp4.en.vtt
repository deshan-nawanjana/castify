00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:21.080
Star light, star bright,

1
00:01:21.081 --> 00:01:24.083
first star I see tonight,

2
00:01:24.084 --> 00:01:27.586
I wish I may, I wish I might

3
00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:31.466
have this wish I wish tonight.

4
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.973
Once upon a time,

5
00:01:38.974 --> 00:01:41.852
a Wishing Star
fell from the sky.

6
00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.065
Scorching a great woods black.

7
00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:52.403
The Dark Forest was born,

8
00:01:52.404 --> 00:01:55.239
the Wishing Star hidden
at its center,

9
00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.284
filling it with new life,

10
00:01:58.285 --> 00:02:02.913
and the legend of a single wish
locked away in the star,

11
00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:06.168
waiting to be granted.

12
00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.344
Puss in Boots!

13
00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:19.430
Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!

14
00:02:19.431 --> 00:02:22.141
Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!

15
00:02:22.142 --> 00:02:25.269
Welcome to my fiesta!

16
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.564
Make yourselves at home, yeah.

17
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:29.940
Come on, eat.

18
00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:32.235
Drink up.

19
00:02:33.362 --> 00:02:35.112
Hey! Hola, amigo.

20
00:02:35.113 --> 00:02:37.240
Good to see you again.

21
00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:41.994
Papa, he stepped on my face!

22
00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:44.247
And we will never wash it again.

23
00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:50.127
People of Cordova...

24
00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:51.754
It's Del Mar.

25
00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.173
People of Del Mar...

26
00:02:54.174 --> 00:02:58.260
accept this golden gift
from Puss in Boots.

27
00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:00.763
Play a song!

28
00:03:00.764 --> 00:03:02.390
No, no, no. I couldn't.

29
00:03:02.391 --> 00:03:04.266
Sing, Puss, sing!

30
00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:06.311

something cool?

Gracias, Del Mar.

103
00:08:22.419 --> 00:08:23.669
You have been great!

104
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.421
Get home safely.

105
00:08:25.422 --> 00:08:27.506
- Good night.
- Puss in Boots!

106
00:08:27.507 --> 00:08:30.300
Puss in Boots! Puss in Boots!
Puss in Boots...

107
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.928
You're still here?

108
00:08:33.138 --> 00:08:34.930
Okay, okay.

109
00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:36.223
One more number.

110
00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:39.519
I call this one
"The Legend Will Never Die..."

111
00:08:42.313 --> 00:08:44.274
Puss in Boots!

112
00:08:47.193 --> 00:08:50.195
Puss? Puss.

113
00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:51.573
Puss in Boots.

114
00:08:57.579 --> 00:08:59.663
Uh, where am I?

115
00:08:59.664 --> 00:09:02.040
Not to worry.
You're in good hands.

116
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.500
My hands!

117
00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.711
I am the village doctor.

118
00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.463
I am also the village barber,
veterinarian,

119
00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:09.174
dentist and witchfinder.

120
00:09:10.967 --> 00:09:13.719
And in my professional opinion,
you need a wash,

121
00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.221
a blowout and a little trim
around the hindquarters.

122
00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:17.556
Uh...

123
00:09:17.557 --> 00:09:19.224
That's my professional
barber opinion.

124
00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.560
But, putting on my doctor's hat,

125
00:09:21.561 --> 00:09:24.229
I think we need to run
a few tests.

126
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:26.482
All right. Reflexes.

127
00:09:26.483 --> 00:09:28.442
Catlike.

128
00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:30.068
Temperature.

129
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:32.404
Now lift your tail and relax.

130
00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:35.991
Trust me, I run hot. Yep.

131
00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:38.744
Then how about the latest
in modern medical technology?

132
00:09:38.745 --> 00:09:40.370
Leeches!

133
00:09:40.371 --> 00:09:42.373
To draw out the evil humors.

134
00:09:43.374 --> 00:09:45.375
Suit yourself. More for me.

135
00:09:45.376 --> 00:09:47.002
Uh, listen, Doctor.

136
00:09:47.003 --> 00:09:50.297
Thanks for everything, you know,
but I am feeling great.

137
00:09:50.298 --> 00:09:52.925
Strong, like a bull! You know?

138
00:09:52.926 --> 00:09:56.261
Now, do you know a good place
to get some gazpacho?

139
00:09:56.262 --> 00:09:58.096
Please. This is serious.

140
00:09:58.097 --> 00:09:59.389
What is it?

141
00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.268
Puss in Boots,
how do I say this?

142
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:06.231
You died.

143
00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:10.234
Doctor, please.

144
00:10:10.235 --> 00:10:12.778
Relax! I am Puss in Boots.

145
00:10:12.779 --> 00:10:14.780
I laugh at death.

146
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.282
You see?

147
00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:19.117
And anyway, I am a cat.

148
00:10:19.118 --> 00:10:20.911
I have nine lives.

149
00:10:20.912 --> 00:10:23.288
And how many times
have you died already?

150
00:10:23.289 --> 00:10:26.041
Uh... I don't know.

151
00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:27.167
I never counted.

152
00:10:27.168 --> 00:10:29.378
I am not really a math guy,
you know?

153
00:10:29.379 --> 00:10:31.588
- Gato.
- Take it easy, Doctor.

154
00:10:31.589 --> 00:10:33.799
Let's see, uh...

155
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:36.385
There was the running
of the bulls in Pamplona.

156
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.639
Hola, señorita.

157
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:42.642
Do you like gazpacho?

158
00:10:43.935 --> 00:10:47.397
Guess it's not
your night, huh, fellas?

159
00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.900
I am telling you,

160
00:10:51.901 --> 00:10:54.152
a cat always lands on his feet.

161
00:10:54.153 --> 00:10:55.655
Watch.

162
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.286
No. Puss in Boots
doesn't need a spotter.

163
00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:04.330
Watch.

164
00:11:05.832 --> 00:11:07.499
No need to pull into port.

165
00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:09.501
This will revolutionize travel.

166
00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:10.920
Watch.

167
00:11:12.171 --> 00:11:15.257
Uh, excuse me.
Does this have shellfish in it?

168
00:11:15.258 --> 00:11:16.508
Yes, sir.

169
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.719
Eh.

170
00:11:19.178 --> 00:11:21.680
Puss, I think you set
the oven too high.

171
00:11:21.681 --> 00:11:24.183
I am a master of the baking.
Watch.

172
00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.438
And then there was
the giant today.

173
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:32.941
So, what is that?
Like, uh, uh, four?

174
00:11:32.942 --> 00:11:35.027
That makes eight, Puss.

175
00:11:35.028 --> 00:11:36.862
You are down to your last life.

176
00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.781
My prescription:
no more adventures for you.

177
00:11:39.782 --> 00:11:41.491
You need to retire.

178
00:11:41.492 --> 00:11:43.243
Me? Retire?

179
00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.162
Are you
the village comedian as well?

180
00:11:45.163 --> 00:11:48.165
Puss, is there any safe place
you can go?

181
00:11:48.166 --> 00:11:50.417
Any special someone
you can rely on

182
00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.252
in this moment of need?

183
00:11:52.253 --> 00:11:56.506
I am Puss in Boots,
loved by one and all.

184
00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:58.008
Anyone in particular?

185
00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:02.304
I mean, uh,
how could I possibly choose?

186
00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:03.889
Mm-hmm.

187
00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:05.933
This is the address
of Mama Luna.

188
00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.893
She is a cat fancier,

189
00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:09.728
always on the lookout
for a new lap cat.

190
00:12:09.729 --> 00:12:11.813
- You will be safe there.
- Lap cat?

191
00:12:11.814 --> 00:12:13.732
I am no lap cat, Doctor.

192
00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:16.234
I am Puss in Boots!

193
00:12:16.235 --> 00:12:17.694
Not anymore.

194
00:12:17.695 --> 00:12:18.820
Barber's orders.

195
00:12:18.821 --> 00:12:20.906
I mean, doctor's orders.

196
00:12:20.907 --> 00:12:25.744
And remember, Puss,
death comes for us all.

197
00:12:25.745 --> 00:12:27.204
Treat?

198
00:12:27.205 --> 00:12:30.291
You've really got to work
on your bedside manner.

199
00:12:41.803 --> 00:12:44.429
I am Puss in Boots.

200
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.432
I am no one's lap cat.

201
00:12:47.934 --> 00:12:50.435
That doctor is a quack
and a crazy man.

202
00:12:50.436 --> 00:12:52.020
He should stick to cutting hair.

203
00:12:52.021 --> 00:12:53.939
Last call, Señor Boots.

204
00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.274
Another glass of cream.
Make it your heaviest.

205
00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:59.445
Oh, I keep the heavy stuff
in the back.

206
00:13:03.032 --> 00:13:05.659
"Retire."

207
00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.371
You are too good-looking
to retire.

208
00:13:20.216 --> 00:13:22.009
Well, well.

209
00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.762
If it isn't
Puss in Boots himself.

210
00:13:26.597 --> 00:13:28.265
In the flesh.

211
00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:31.060
Uh, hey.

212
00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:34.813
There's the famous hat,
the feather

213
00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.650
and, of course, the boots.

214
00:13:38.651 --> 00:13:40.737
My compliments to your cobbler.

215
00:13:42.071 --> 00:13:43.989
Thanks.

216
00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:47.243
Uh, good to meet you, too.

217
00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:53.165
Hey. I never do this,
but can I get your autograph?

218
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:57.170
Been following you
for a long time.

219
00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.173
Sign right there.

220
00:14:03.593 --> 00:14:06.511
Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death,

221
00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:08.388
bounty hunter.

222
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:10.265
So I've heard.

223
00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:13.478
You will find your reward
does not come easily.

224
00:14:14.604 --> 00:14:16.063
This I tell you.

225
00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:19.900
Everyone thinks they'll be
the one to defeat me,

226
00:14:19.901 --> 00:14:22.360
but no one's escaped me yet.

227
00:14:22.361 --> 00:14:23.862
All right.

228
00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.572
Let's get it over with.

229
00:14:25.573 --> 00:14:27.867
Fear me, if you da...

230
00:14:34.332 --> 00:14:37.335
Okay, no more messing around.

231
00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:43.716
Slow. Sloppy. Sad.

232
00:14:56.771 --> 00:14:59.941
You're not
living up to the legend, gato.

233
00:15:33.266 --> 00:15:37.103
I just love the smell of fear.

234
00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.782
What's the matter?

235
00:15:50.783 --> 00:15:53.619
Lives flashing before your eyes?

236
00:15:55.872 --> 00:15:57.290
Pick it up.

237
00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.459
Pick it up.

238
00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:27.528

I'm sorry.

250
00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.017
We are gathered here today

251
00:17:41.018 --> 00:17:44.729
to say goodbye to Puss in Boots.

252
00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:48.359
There are no words
to express such a loss.

253
00:17:49.151 --> 00:17:51.112
Thank you.

254
00:17:54.991 --> 00:17:57.659
But it would be a crime
not to try.

255
00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.578
He was known across the land
by many names.

256
00:18:00.579 --> 00:18:01.955
The Stabby Tabby.

257
00:18:01.956 --> 00:18:03.748
El Macho Gato.

258
00:18:03.749 --> 00:18:05.625
The Leche Whisperer.

259
00:18:05.626 --> 00:18:07.585
To some, an outlaw.

260
00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:09.629
To more, a hero.

261
00:18:09.630 --> 00:18:12.924
To all, a legend.

262
00:18:12.925 --> 00:18:14.759
I was right.

263
00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:17.096
Words were not enough.

264
00:18:19.682 --> 00:18:21.766
But perhaps a song.

I told you
health department people,

270
00:19:00.848 --> 00:19:02.265
there are no cats here!

271
00:19:02.266 --> 00:19:04.184
Uh...

272
00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:06.520

Oh!

274
00:19:10.691 --> 00:19:13.151
You're not from
the health department, are you?

275
00:19:13.152 --> 00:19:15.153
No, you're not.
We better get you inside

276
00:19:15.154 --> 00:19:18.740
because, baby,
they are always watching.

277

thought of something perfect.

Ooh.

293
00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.905
What? Did I say something salty?

294
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:00.865
It's my second language.

295
00:20:00.866 --> 00:20:03.118
Stupid mittens.

00:20:03.119 --> 00:20:05.036

00:22:26.095 --> 00:22:27.721
Oh, sorry.

You're a talking cat?

I'm a talking cat.

329
00:22:33.227 --> 00:22:35.061

00:22:37.523 --> 00:22:39.190
Oh, not a problem.

332
00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.192
We can eat and talk
at the same time.

333
00:22:41.193 --> 00:22:42.860
No hablo inglés.

334
00:22:42.861 --> 00:22:44.571
¿Hablas español?! Yo también!

335
00:22:44.572 --> 00:22:46.739
!Ah! ¿De dónde eres?
¿Te gustan las siestas?

336
00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:49.200
I don't speak Spanish, either.

337
00:22:49.201 --> 00:22:50.702
You're funny.

338
00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:53.371
- Uh... okay. Good talk.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

339
00:22:53.372 --> 00:22:55.832
Pickles? Is that your name?

340
00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:58.460
Me, I don't have a name
or a home.

341
00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:04.048
So, I'm no expert, but you
don't look like a Pickles.

342
00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:06.342
Well, you don't look like a cat.

343
00:23:06.343 --> 00:23:08.386
Okay, okay, okay.

344
00:23:08.387 --> 00:23:10.638
Full disclosure: I'm not a cat.

345
00:23:10.639 --> 00:23:13.057
- I'm a dog.
- Hi, Bon Bon.

346
00:23:13.058 --> 00:23:14.559
Meow.

347
00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.730
Oh, Pickles has
a new girlfriend? Okay.

348
00:23:18.731 --> 00:23:20.273
I live under the porch.

349
00:23:20.274 --> 00:23:21.899
It can get a little lonely
down there.

350
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:24.068
It's mostly controlled by
the rats and the centipedes,

351
00:23:24.069 --> 00:23:25.570
but I have my own little corner.

352
00:23:25.571 --> 00:23:27.071
Congratulations.

353
00:23:27.072 --> 00:23:28.990
I just come up here
for the food and the friends.

354
00:23:28.991 --> 00:23:31.409
Mostly... mostly the food.

355
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.786
Please don't tell anyone.
I need this.

356
00:23:33.787 --> 00:23:35.997
I won't tell. I don't care.

357
00:23:35.998 --> 00:23:37.498
So you'll keep my secret?

358
00:23:37.499 --> 00:23:39.167
A secret between friends?

359
00:23:39.168 --> 00:23:40.877
Just a secret.

360
00:23:40.878 --> 00:23:43.254
It's funny... despite all this
best friend bonding,

361
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:45.256
you're still a mystery to me,
Pickles.

362
00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:46.799
What's your story?

363
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.092
My story...

364
00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.930
What are we looking at?

365
00:23:53.807 --> 00:23:55.266
Is over.

366
00:23:55.267 --> 00:23:57.143
Oh, no.

367
00:23:57.144 --> 00:23:59.187
Want to rub my belly?

368
00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:00.772
Hmm?

369
00:24:00.773 --> 00:24:02.398
What-what's happening?

370
00:24:02.399 --> 00:24:04.275
- Rub.
- Hard pass.

371
00:24:04.276 --> 00:24:06.444
Come on, rub.
I need the practice.

372
00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:08.279
I'm gonna be
a therapy dog someday.

373
00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.614
What the hell are you
talking about?

374
00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:11.074
I'm glad you asked.

375
00:24:11.075 --> 00:24:13.117
When people feel bad,
they can rub my belly.

376
00:24:13.118 --> 00:24:15.286
It'll make 'em feel better.
Rub my belly.

377
00:24:15.287 --> 00:24:16.663
- No. No.
- Come on, rub it.

378
00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:18.289
- Not happening. No.
- Rub it.

379
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:19.624
Let me be clear.

380
00:24:19.625 --> 00:24:22.460
I don't want to touch
your belly, okay?

381
00:24:22.461 --> 00:24:25.004
Okey doke.
So, what do you want?

382
00:24:25.005 --> 00:24:28.550
I want to be left alone.

383
00:24:48.654 --> 00:24:51.114
Ugh, you're back.

384
00:24:51.115 --> 00:24:53.075
Oh, I never left.

385
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.881
The wolf. He found me.

386
00:25:18.517 --> 00:25:20.476
Hello, missus.

387
00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:22.103
We're looking for a cat.

388
00:25:22.104 --> 00:25:23.438
This cat.

389
00:25:23.439 --> 00:25:25.231
We've got an offer for him.

390
00:25:25.232 --> 00:25:28.109
What could they possibly want
to offer Puss in Boots?

391
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:31.028
- What's a Puss in Boots?
- Seriously?

392
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:32.447
I told you
health department people,

393
00:25:32.448 --> 00:25:33.698
there are no cats here.

394
00:25:33.699 --> 00:25:35.868
Make her talk.

395
00:25:38.203 --> 00:25:39.746
Excuse me, my darling.

396
00:25:39.747 --> 00:25:42.206
We're looking for
the legendary Puss in Boots.

397
00:25:42.207 --> 00:25:44.542
Have you perhaps... seen him?

398
00:25:44.543 --> 00:25:45.793
Too soft.

399
00:25:45.794 --> 00:25:47.128
Out with it, you old biddy,

400
00:25:47.129 --> 00:25:49.298
or I'll have your guts
for garters.

401
00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:54.552
Too hard.
That was not just right.

402
00:25:54.553 --> 00:25:56.637
Oi, Baby, sniff him out.

403
00:25:56.638 --> 00:25:58.556
You don't tell me what to do.

404
00:25:58.557 --> 00:25:59.640
Listen to your sister, Baby.

405
00:25:59.641 --> 00:26:01.267
Oh, she's not my sister!

406
00:26:01.268 --> 00:26:02.810
She's a fugitive orphan.

407
00:26:02.811 --> 00:26:04.312
- Ow!
- She is your sister.

408
00:26:04.313 --> 00:26:05.605
Do as she says.

409
00:26:05.606 --> 00:26:09.066
Fine, but all I can smell
is cats' pee.

410
00:26:09.067 --> 00:26:10.777
Everybody!

411
00:26:10.778 --> 00:26:12.779
Get to the safe room,
just like we practiced!

412
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.655
Oi. She's leggin' it.

413
00:26:14.656 --> 00:26:16.741
Follow me, children! Ow!

414
00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:18.910
Give her the piano
treatment, Papa.

415
00:26:18.911 --> 00:26:21.245
Oh! You think this is
the first time

416
00:26:21.246 --> 00:26:23.123
I've been stuffed in a piano?

417
00:26:24.833 --> 00:26:26.752
Here we go!

418
00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:30.463
♪ Roll out the barrel... ♪

419
00:26:30.464 --> 00:26:33.175
- Oh...
- Mama, focus, please.

420
00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.640
Hey! There's cats everywhere!

421
00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:43.309
So many cats!

422
00:26:43.310 --> 00:26:44.728
Amateurs.

423
00:26:45.521 --> 00:26:47.688
I'll be outside.

424
00:26:47.689 --> 00:26:49.607
My cats can play
better than you.

425
00:26:49.608 --> 00:26:51.651
♪ Now's the time
to roll out the barrel... ♪

426
00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:53.611
Goldi, is this him?

427
00:26:53.612 --> 00:26:55.279
That's a dog in a cat costume.

428
00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.823
Oh, yeah.

429
00:26:56.824 --> 00:26:58.449
Tricky little bugger.

430
00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.285
How about this one?
He's a ginger.

431
00:27:02.621 --> 00:27:04.163
Is that a joke?

432
00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:07.291
You think this scruffy,
geriatric bag of bones

433
00:27:07.292 --> 00:27:08.960
looks like a legend?

434
00:27:08.961 --> 00:27:10.461
This is definitely not...

435
00:27:10.462 --> 00:27:12.714
Puss in Boots! I found him!

436
00:27:13.632 --> 00:27:16.843
Puss in Boots, dead and buried.

437
00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:18.970
Dead? No, no, no, he can't be.

438
00:27:18.971 --> 00:27:21.722
Yep. The nose never lies.

439
00:27:21.723 --> 00:27:23.474
Well, that's that, then.

440
00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:25.142
What say we go
and hibernate, huh?

441
00:27:25.143 --> 00:27:26.477
- No.
- Ow!

442
00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:28.145
The map is being
delivered tonight,

443
00:27:28.146 --> 00:27:30.064
and we have one chance
to steal it.

444
00:27:30.065 --> 00:27:32.358
Without it, we'll never find
the Wishing Star.

445
00:27:32.359 --> 00:27:34.193
The Wishing Star.

446
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:35.862
It does exist.

447
00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:38.155
That star has one wish to grant.

448
00:27:38.156 --> 00:27:39.532
One wish?

449
00:27:39.533 --> 00:27:41.576
Think of what
that could mean for us.

450
00:27:41.577 --> 00:27:43.786
Nine lives. Yes!

451
00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:45.663
Well, I don't see
why we needed to hire

452
00:27:45.664 --> 00:27:47.248
Puss in Boots
in the first place.

453
00:27:47.249 --> 00:27:51.252
Ugh. Because nobody steals
from Big Jack Horner.

454
00:27:51.253 --> 00:27:53.212
No! Not Jack Horner.

455
00:27:53.213 --> 00:27:56.424
Don't worry, love.
We'll get that wish somehow.

456
00:27:56.425 --> 00:27:57.758
Thank you, Mama.

457
00:27:57.759 --> 00:28:00.177
Yeah, because I've got a plan.

458
00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.598
I can nick a map
as good as any old cat.

459
00:28:04.182 --> 00:28:06.058
You've got a plan?

460
00:28:06.059 --> 00:28:08.269
What? I'm smart, ain't I?
Ain't I, Papa?

461
00:28:08.270 --> 00:28:11.856
No, you ain't
well-fixed for brains.

462
00:28:11.857 --> 00:28:15.610
Robbing Big Jack Horner...
Very risky.

463
00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:18.696
But that wish could get me
my lives back.

464
00:28:18.697 --> 00:28:20.698
And my life back.

465
00:28:20.699 --> 00:28:22.533
Goodbye, Pickles!

466
00:28:22.534 --> 00:28:24.035
Oh, no, Pickles, you're leaving?

467
00:28:24.036 --> 00:28:26.162
Perro, start digging.

468
00:28:26.163 --> 00:28:27.830
Okay.

469
00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:29.998
But if this Puss in Boots
is such a big deal,

470
00:28:29.999 --> 00:28:31.792
maybe we shouldn't be
desecrating his grave.

471
00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:36.131
No, I don't think he would mind,
because he...

472
00:28:38.216 --> 00:28:40.384
is me!

473
00:28:40.385 --> 00:28:43.554
Oh. O-Okay.

474
00:28:43.555 --> 00:28:45.431
Oh, yeah. Uh...

475
00:28:45.432 --> 00:28:47.058
Normally, I have a sword.

476
00:28:47.059 --> 00:28:48.851
It's like a whole thing,
you know?

477
00:28:48.852 --> 00:28:50.770
Pickles, you're Puss in Boots?

478
00:28:50.771 --> 00:28:52.563
Not yet, but I will be.

479
00:28:52.564 --> 00:28:53.898
I'll come...

480
00:28:53.899 --> 00:28:55.900
- I'll come with you.
- Sorry, perro.

481
00:28:55.901 --> 00:28:58.653
Puss in Boots walks alone!

482
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:07.955
Open the gates!

483
00:29:18.924 --> 00:29:20.758
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

484
00:29:20.759 --> 00:29:23.719
Hands off the merchandise.
We got this.

485
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:26.097
Okay. Just get in and get out.

486
00:29:26.098 --> 00:29:28.641
- Easy peasy.
- Lemon squeezy.

487
00:29:28.642 --> 00:29:30.476
Aah! What are you doing here?

488
00:29:30.477 --> 00:29:32.019
I brought you a sword.

489
00:29:32.020 --> 00:29:33.980
That's not a sword.
That's a stick.

490
00:29:33.981 --> 00:29:36.023
- It's a stick sword.
- Go home.

491
00:29:36.024 --> 00:29:37.775
Well, my home is where
my friends are.

492
00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.443
Again, not friends.

493
00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:40.778
Rub for luck?

494
00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:43.114
I don't need luck for this.

495
00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:45.616
I am a highly skilled
master cat thief.

496
00:29:45.617 --> 00:29:47.411
Watch.

497
00:29:49.955 --> 00:29:52.290
You got this.

498
00:30:07.472 --> 00:30:10.057
Hmm.

499
00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:14.813
I pronounce this batch...
delicious.

500
00:30:17.774 --> 00:30:19.526
Ship 'em out.

501
00:30:20.610 --> 00:30:22.695
Mr. Horner.

502
00:30:22.696 --> 00:30:25.114
The Serpent Sisters
got the goods.

503
00:30:25.115 --> 00:30:29.201
Is it? Is it the map
to the Wishing Star?

504
00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:31.996
Stop everything.
You two, come with me.

505
00:30:31.997 --> 00:30:33.664
We must get this
to the trophy room.

506
00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:37.293
You know, it took a lot
of murdering to get this map.

507
00:30:37.294 --> 00:30:38.669
It all started...

508
00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.547
Take it to the trophy room!

509
00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:54.101
What the...

510
00:30:54.102 --> 00:30:56.979
Wow. Look at all
the magic stuff.

511
00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.981
Yes, I collect
enchanted objects,

512
00:30:58.982 --> 00:31:01.067
magical icons,
bobbles and geegaws

513
00:31:01.068 --> 00:31:03.402
and la-di-da and blah-blah-blah.

514
00:31:03.403 --> 00:31:06.363
Check it out.
I'm walking on a magic carpet.

515
00:31:06.364 --> 00:31:07.990
Sweet.

516
00:31:07.991 --> 00:31:09.950
The shrunken ship
of the Lilliputians.

517
00:31:09.951 --> 00:31:12.995
Shut up!
Are those unicorn horns?

518
00:31:12.996 --> 00:31:14.872
Baby unicorn horns.

519
00:31:14.873 --> 00:31:17.041
Half as heavy, twice as sharp.

520
00:31:17.042 --> 00:31:19.543
- Savage.
- They're trinkets.

521
00:31:19.544 --> 00:31:21.796
They're nothing compared
to the awesome power

522
00:31:21.797 --> 00:31:23.255
of the magic Wishing Star.

523
00:31:23.256 --> 00:31:25.674
Speaking of which,
make with the box, sister.

524
00:31:25.675 --> 00:31:26.842
You got it, boss.

525
00:31:26.843 --> 00:31:28.719
Like I was saying,

526
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.554
the amount of murdering we...

527
00:31:30.555 --> 00:31:32.389
Make with the box!

528
00:31:32.390 --> 00:31:36.393
After so many years
of searching,

529
00:31:36.394 --> 00:31:38.312
this is my moment.

530
00:31:38.313 --> 00:31:42.858
With this wish,
I will finally be

531
00:31:42.859 --> 00:31:45.069
the master of all magic.

532
00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:47.030
Hey, Little Jack.

533
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:50.282
Excuse me?

534
00:31:50.283 --> 00:31:51.826
- Could you do the thumb thing?
- Shh.

535
00:31:51.827 --> 00:31:53.160
Like in the fairy tale?

536
00:31:53.161 --> 00:31:54.829
It wasn't a fairy tale!

537
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:56.372
It was only a nursery rhyme.

538
00:31:56.373 --> 00:31:58.916
Oh, yeah. The lame one.

539
00:31:58.917 --> 00:32:01.127
Little Jack Horner
sat in the corner

540
00:32:01.128 --> 00:32:03.129
eating a Horner pie...

541
00:32:03.130 --> 00:32:05.381
♪ Stuck in my thumb,
pulled out a plum ♪

542
00:32:05.382 --> 00:32:09.427
♪ And said,
"What a good boy am I." ♪

543
00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:11.971
Look! A magic puppet.

544
00:32:11.972 --> 00:32:13.848
♪ 'Cause I'm a real boy ♪

545
00:32:13.849 --> 00:32:15.474
♪ No strings attached. ♪

546
00:32:15.475 --> 00:32:17.685
Thank you. Thank you.

547
00:32:17.686 --> 00:32:19.061
What's impressive?

548
00:32:19.062 --> 00:32:21.439
I've been a boy the whole time.

549
00:32:22.399 --> 00:32:26.068
Little Jack Horner
didn't have any magic.

550
00:32:26.069 --> 00:32:30.656
He was a pathetic,
buttered baker's boy.

551
00:32:30.657 --> 00:32:32.992
Little Jack's dead!

552
00:32:32.993 --> 00:32:34.869
I'm Big Jack Horner.

553
00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:38.497
Uh, Mr. Big Jack Horner, sir...

554
00:32:38.498 --> 00:32:41.041
- I barely know her.
- What do you mean?

555
00:32:41.042 --> 00:32:43.919
We're sisters, you goof.

556
00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.714
We got matching face tattoos.

557
00:32:46.715 --> 00:32:49.759
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.

558
00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:53.637
- Puss?
- Kitty?

559
00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.765
- Puss...
- Kitty!

560
00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:02.396
This is my job.

561
00:33:02.397 --> 00:33:05.316
No, this is my job.
I'm double-crossing the bears.

562
00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:07.109
No, I am double-crossing
the bears.

563
00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:09.153
They tried to hire me
earlier today.

564
00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:11.071
Well, they tried to hire me
two weeks ago.

565
00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:13.032
That makes you plan B.

566
00:33:13.033 --> 00:33:14.325
Aha!

567
00:33:14.326 --> 00:33:16.952
- There it is.
- Whew.

568
00:33:16.953 --> 00:33:18.579
Now, about your payment.

569
00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:22.666
Hold up. You promised us
our weight in gold.

570
00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:24.084
I did, didn't I?

571
00:33:24.085 --> 00:33:26.045
Ever hear of the Midas touch?

572
00:33:26.046 --> 00:33:28.589
Ah, cool. Dibs.

573
00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.468
Oh, no.
I misjudged the situation.

574
00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.637
This is why you don't cross
Jack Horner.

575
00:33:34.638 --> 00:33:35.846
What is this?

576
00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:37.348
- Are you a pirate now?
- Shh.

577
00:33:37.349 --> 00:33:40.267
It's like a possum crawled
on your face and died.

578
00:33:40.268 --> 00:33:42.561
- Shh!
- Of shame.

579
00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:44.271
Please, mock me quietly.

580
00:33:44.272 --> 00:33:46.148
I hate it. It's disgusting.

581
00:33:46.149 --> 00:33:48.652
Well, I love it.
It's distinguished.

582
00:33:56.409 --> 00:34:00.622
Great plan, Baby. Real catlike.

583
00:34:05.919 --> 00:34:08.712
Uh, can I go?

584
00:34:08.713 --> 00:34:10.757
Pleasure doing, uh...

585
00:34:12.384 --> 00:34:15.386
- Puss in Boots?
- Goldi. Bears.

586
00:34:15.387 --> 00:34:18.055
- Hola, Jack.
- Kitty Softpaws.

587
00:34:18.056 --> 00:34:21.433
My, you have a lot of nerve
coming back here.

588
00:34:21.434 --> 00:34:23.936
Please. I was the best thief
you ever hired.

589
00:34:23.937 --> 00:34:25.729
- You robbed me.
- You set me up.

590
00:34:25.730 --> 00:34:28.899
You said you were going
on some spiritual retreat.

591
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.067
Namaste.

592
00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.819
And you're supposed to be dead.

593
00:34:31.820 --> 00:34:33.112
I got better?

594
00:34:33.113 --> 00:34:34.405
Ugh. Just give us the map.

595
00:34:34.406 --> 00:34:36.073
- And throw in a dozen pies.
- Eh?

596
00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:37.449
Ooh. Have you got
any savory pies?

597
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:39.285
- What? N-No.
- Yeah, what flavors you got?

598
00:34:39.286 --> 00:34:40.911
Can we get all of that
in a bag to go?

599
00:34:40.912 --> 00:34:44.123
Oh, would you stop talking
about blooming pies? Focus!

600
00:34:44.124 --> 00:34:45.916
Hand over that map,

601
00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:47.836
or I'll punch holes
in the lot of ya.

602
00:34:49.129 --> 00:34:52.382
- Oh, bums.
- Look out! It's coming down!

603
00:34:55.593 --> 00:34:56.927
Ha!

604
00:34:56.928 --> 00:35:01.141
I hate talking
fairy tale animals!

605
00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.770
What? Get back here!

606
00:35:06.771 --> 00:35:08.480
The best thief has won.

607
00:35:08.481 --> 00:35:10.149
- Huh?
- You're right.

608
00:35:10.150 --> 00:35:12.192
She did.

609
00:35:12.193 --> 00:35:13.320
Oh, come on!

610
00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:16.613
There. They're getting away.

611
00:35:24.956 --> 00:35:27.291
Ooh.

612
00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:29.586
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no!

613
00:35:30.962 --> 00:35:32.963
Nice catching up with you, Puss.

614
00:35:32.964 --> 00:35:34.841
Got to go.

615
00:35:35.967 --> 00:35:38.261
Here, kitty, kitty.

616
00:35:39.596 --> 00:35:41.930
Is that a stick? What are you
gonna do with that...

617
00:35:41.931 --> 00:35:44.225
- Ow!
- Ow! Me knuckles!

618
00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:46.811
You shouldn't have
done that, mate.

619
00:35:50.065 --> 00:35:51.441
This idiot.

620
00:35:56.654 --> 00:35:58.989
Hey, Puss.
I found a sandwich in here.

621
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.157
I think it's tuna fish.

622
00:36:00.158 --> 00:36:01.409
- Drive, perro!
- Okey doke.

623
00:36:09.667 --> 00:36:12.169
Oh, cool.
Another member of the team.

624
00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:13.295
We are not a team.

625
00:36:13.296 --> 00:36:14.838
- Eyes on the road!
- Whoa!

626
00:36:14.839 --> 00:36:16.090
Who is this guy?

627
00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:18.092
- I'm Puss's best friend.
- No, he isn't.

628
00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:19.301
And his therapy dog.

629
00:36:19.302 --> 00:36:20.803
Definitely not.

630
00:36:20.804 --> 00:36:23.181
Finally. You need therapy.

631
00:36:26.059 --> 00:36:27.518
Give me the map. Trust me.

632
00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:30.729
Trust you?
Like I did in Santa Coloma?

633
00:36:30.730 --> 00:36:31.980
Really? Santa Coloma?

634
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:34.192
Sí, Santa Coloma.

635
00:36:37.278 --> 00:36:38.737
- Mine!
- Mine!

636
00:36:38.738 --> 00:36:40.073
- Mine!
- Mine!

637
00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:48.832
Hyah!

638
00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:58.382
Good people,
accept this golden gift

639
00:36:58.383 --> 00:37:00.885
from Puss in Boots!

640
00:37:12.564 --> 00:37:15.358
Speed up! Go, go, go!

641
00:37:18.319 --> 00:37:22.240
Assemble the Baker's Dozen.

642
00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:25.075
Careful with this.

643
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:27.327
I'll take this and that.

644
00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:28.745
Oh, and these. One of those.

645
00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:31.123
And I got to take that.
Yes. Yes.

646
00:37:31.124 --> 00:37:34.252
No. Yes! Oh, yeah!

647
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:39.089
All of these!

648
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:42.260
This one is right.

649
00:37:54.439 --> 00:37:59.652
I'll get you, my kitties,
and your little dog, too.

650
00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.784
What? This is blank.

651
00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:10.454
We've been ripped off!
Where is the...

652
00:38:10.455 --> 00:38:13.457
Oh. Yeah.
I knew it was gonna do that.

653
00:38:13.458 --> 00:38:16.293
"The Dark Forest
is deep and far.

654
00:38:16.294 --> 00:38:19.254
Within its bounds,
you'll find the star."

655
00:38:19.255 --> 00:38:21.715
The Dark Forest?

656
00:38:21.716 --> 00:38:24.176
No one goes
into the Dark Forest.

657
00:38:24.177 --> 00:38:25.886
Or comes out.

658
00:38:25.887 --> 00:38:28.555
"A single wish
burns true and bright.

659
00:38:28.556 --> 00:38:31.768
This map's the key,
so hold on tight."

660
00:38:32.977 --> 00:38:34.520
Suéltalo.

661
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:36.688
- You let go.
- A stick?

662
00:38:36.689 --> 00:38:39.149
What happened to your sword?

663
00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.442
Got rid of it, you know.

664
00:38:40.443 --> 00:38:41.985
Made things too easy.

665
00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.487
I needed a challenge.

666
00:38:43.488 --> 00:38:45.949
Yeah, you looked
pretty challenged back there.

667
00:38:47.367 --> 00:38:49.159
There's no way I'm letting you
hold the map.

668
00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:51.370
Well, there's no way
I'm letting you hold the map.

669
00:38:51.371 --> 00:38:53.665
I can hold it.

670
00:38:54.541 --> 00:38:56.667
Yeah, right.
What's your deal, anyway?

671
00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:58.502
You run with the Chihuahua Gang?

672
00:38:58.503 --> 00:38:59.753
I don't think so.

673
00:38:59.754 --> 00:39:01.547
- I don't believe you.
- That's okay.

674
00:39:01.548 --> 00:39:03.882
As long as you believe
in yourself.

675
00:39:03.883 --> 00:39:05.217
Wha...

676
00:39:05.218 --> 00:39:07.427
Is he deranged?

677
00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:09.263
- Yep.
- What's your name?

678
00:39:09.264 --> 00:39:11.431
Oh, I've been called
all kinds of things.

679
00:39:11.432 --> 00:39:13.100
Dog, Bad Dog, Stupid Dog.

680
00:39:13.101 --> 00:39:16.186
Hey You! You There! Get Out!
Leave It! Drop It!

681
00:39:16.187 --> 00:39:18.480
Big Rat, Small Pig, Rat Face,

682
00:39:18.481 --> 00:39:20.065
Butt Nugget, for Brains.

683
00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:21.650
You know, that sort of thing.

684
00:39:21.651 --> 00:39:24.361
But I've never had a name
that really stuck, you know?

685
00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.321
That belonged to me.

686
00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:28.907
- Is he done?
- And you are?

687
00:39:28.908 --> 00:39:30.242
Softpaws.

688
00:39:30.243 --> 00:39:31.743
Kitty Softpaws.

689
00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:34.246
Wow. Yeah.
Now, that's a good name.

690
00:39:34.247 --> 00:39:35.998
There's music
in a name like that.

691
00:39:35.999 --> 00:39:38.458
Kitty Softpaws.

692
00:39:38.459 --> 00:39:41.378
Nice try. Classic con.

693
00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:44.006
No one's that dumb.
No one's that nice.

694
00:39:44.007 --> 00:39:45.340
I don't trust you.

695
00:39:45.341 --> 00:39:47.551
Me, neither.
He cannot be trusted.

696
00:39:47.552 --> 00:39:50.846
But I trust him
more than I trust you.

697
00:39:50.847 --> 00:39:54.017
Wow.
This trip is going to be fun.

698
00:40:27.508 --> 00:40:30.720
This must be the Dark Forest.

699
00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:42.356
Oh, my God!

700
00:40:42.357 --> 00:40:43.774
It's gone.

701
00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:44.941
It's back.

702
00:40:44.942 --> 00:40:46.276
Ay, qué miedo.

703
00:40:46.277 --> 00:40:49.112
Nothing to worry about.

704
00:40:49.113 --> 00:40:51.031
We step through as one.

705
00:40:51.032 --> 00:40:52.115
Ready?

706
00:40:52.116 --> 00:40:54.034
One, two, after you.

707
00:40:54.035 --> 00:40:56.162
Wait, what?

708
00:40:58.206 --> 00:41:00.415
Dog? Still alive?

709
00:41:00.416 --> 00:41:02.126
- Let's go find out.
- Wait!

710
00:41:10.301 --> 00:41:12.136
Um...

711
00:41:13.346 --> 00:41:16.306
- Whoa.
- Wow.

712
00:41:16.307 --> 00:41:20.852
For a Dark Forest,
this place is pretty colorful.

713
00:41:20.853 --> 00:41:22.979
I wish I had
my quinceañera here.

714
00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.149
The Wishing Star is
in here somewhere.

715
00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:29.069
Kitty, may I please see the map?

716
00:41:29.070 --> 00:41:30.487
- No.
- Seriously!

717
00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:32.823
You won't let me hold it
for even one minute?

718
00:41:32.824 --> 00:41:34.866
Nope. Not even for one second.

719
00:41:34.867 --> 00:41:39.205
Come on, Kitty.
You've got to trust me.

720
00:41:40.373 --> 00:41:42.708
Wait. Wh-Wh-What's...
What's going on with his eyes?

721
00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:45.168
Oh, they're getting bigger.

722
00:41:45.169 --> 00:41:47.546
Oh, Kitty!

723
00:41:47.547 --> 00:41:49.673
You got to trust him.
Look at those eyes.

724
00:41:49.674 --> 00:41:52.051
Really? You call that cute?

725
00:41:53.302 --> 00:41:55.429
Oh, look at her!

726
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:58.348
Those eyes are even bigger
than yours.

727
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:59.599
Do whatever she wants, Puss.

728
00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:02.686
Wait a second. So poofy!

729
00:42:02.687 --> 00:42:05.188
No. With the paws?

730
00:42:05.189 --> 00:42:06.606
Come on.

731
00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:08.525
With the hat?

732
00:42:08.526 --> 00:42:11.361
It's all so cute!

733
00:42:11.362 --> 00:42:14.574
Cuteness overload!

734
00:42:15.616 --> 00:42:17.535
Can we look at the map now?

735
00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.207
"Follow this enchanted chart.

736
00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:28.254
It knows your path
and knows your heart."

737
00:42:29.213 --> 00:42:31.299
Is that us?

738
00:42:45.897 --> 00:42:49.399
It says we must go through
the Valley of Incineration

739
00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:51.276
over Undertaker Ridge,

740
00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:53.028
through the Cave of Lost Souls?

741
00:42:53.029 --> 00:42:55.656
- Really?
- Let me take a look.

742
00:43:09.420 --> 00:43:10.670
What?

743
00:43:10.671 --> 00:43:12.756
Swamp of Infinite Sorrows?

744
00:43:12.757 --> 00:43:14.716
Mountains of Misery?

745
00:43:14.717 --> 00:43:17.052
The Abyss of Eternal Loneliness?

746
00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:19.304
There's something wrong
with this map.

747
00:43:19.305 --> 00:43:21.807
I guess there is a different
terrible path for everyone.

748
00:43:21.808 --> 00:43:23.517
It's almost like the forest

749
00:43:23.518 --> 00:43:25.811
doesn't want anyone
to make a wish.

750
00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:28.689
Well, I don't even have a wish,
but can I try?

751
00:43:35.404 --> 00:43:36.947
Oh, mine says...

752
00:43:36.948 --> 00:43:38.740
We skip through
the Pocket Full of Posies.

753
00:43:38.741 --> 00:43:40.033
- What?
- Huh?

754
00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:42.285
Then drift down
the River of Relaxation.

755
00:43:42.286 --> 00:43:43.495
- That sounds fun.
- No fair.

756
00:43:43.496 --> 00:43:44.996
Why does he get the good one?

757
00:43:44.997 --> 00:43:47.207
Wander the Fields
of Quick and Easy Solutions,

758
00:43:47.208 --> 00:43:48.625
and arrive at the star.

759
00:43:48.626 --> 00:43:51.378
Oh, wow! That sounds wonderful.

760
00:43:51.379 --> 00:43:53.338
Oh, but no. This is your quest.

761
00:43:53.339 --> 00:43:54.631
I don't want to impose.

762
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.550
You hold the map.
Really?

763
00:43:56.551 --> 00:43:57.843
But don't you cross me,

764
00:43:57.844 --> 00:44:00.554
or your name will be
Perro Muerto.

765
00:44:00.555 --> 00:44:02.181
Okey dokey.

766
00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:07.144
Wait. Is that...

767
00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:11.022
It's raining bears. Time to go.

768
00:44:11.023 --> 00:44:13.191
Oh, I'm tellin' ya,

769
00:44:13.192 --> 00:44:14.734
when we get that wish,

770
00:44:14.735 --> 00:44:17.195
it will make everything
just right for all of us.

771
00:44:17.196 --> 00:44:18.989
Will it make us rich?

772
00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:21.283
Rich enough to hibernate
all the year round?

773
00:44:21.284 --> 00:44:22.784
The richest.

774
00:44:22.785 --> 00:44:24.494
Will we be, like,
big-time thieves?

775
00:44:24.495 --> 00:44:26.663
The biggest.

776
00:44:26.664 --> 00:44:28.832
Eh, you know that suit
Jack Horner wears?

777
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:30.500
- Yeah.
- I'm going to have one of them.

778
00:44:30.501 --> 00:44:32.586
- Yeah?
- Only mine will be purpler.

779
00:44:32.587 --> 00:44:35.255
- Like, twice as purpler.
- The purplest!

780
00:44:35.256 --> 00:44:36.882
Nice.

781
00:44:36.883 --> 00:44:38.842
Big-time thieves coming through!

782
00:44:38.843 --> 00:44:41.052
- I'll race ya!
- You can't beat me, old man!

783
00:44:41.053 --> 00:44:42.929
What kind of wish
can do all that, Goldi?

784
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:44.806
Oh, I can't tell ya.

785
00:44:44.807 --> 00:44:47.642
If you say what your wish is,
then it don't come true.

786
00:44:47.643 --> 00:44:49.185
Sorry. Birthday wish rules.

787
00:44:49.186 --> 00:44:52.022
Oh, come on.
Mother-daughter secret?

788
00:44:52.023 --> 00:44:53.690
Mama, just drop it, please.

789
00:44:53.691 --> 00:44:55.233
Oh. Oh, okay.

790
00:44:55.234 --> 00:44:56.526
Hey, come on.

791
00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:58.528
We've got some cats to catch.

792
00:45:02.617 --> 00:45:04.868
Birthday wish rules?
What's that mean?

793
00:45:04.869 --> 00:45:07.203
It means I am not
telling you my wish.

794
00:45:07.204 --> 00:45:09.831
He doesn't want to tell us,
because it's something stupid.

795
00:45:09.832 --> 00:45:12.417
Like conditioner
for that thing on his face.

796
00:45:12.418 --> 00:45:14.044
It's distinguished.

797
00:45:14.045 --> 00:45:17.006
What about you, Kitty?
What are you gonna wish for?

798
00:45:17.715 --> 00:45:18.798
Can't tell you.

799
00:45:18.799 --> 00:45:20.800
Birthday wish rules or whatever.

800
00:45:20.801 --> 00:45:23.095
Ha! I bet your wish
is something stupid like...

801
00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:27.850
You're such a...

802
00:45:31.812 --> 00:45:35.232
This must be
the Pocket Full of Posies.

803
00:45:38.861 --> 00:45:40.779
Out of the way, demon flower.

804
00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.740
It's pruning time!

805
00:45:50.373 --> 00:45:52.291
Aw, thank you.

806
00:45:54.919 --> 00:45:56.544
We don't have time for this.

807
00:45:56.545 --> 00:45:59.090
Perro, I thought your path
was supposed to be easy.

808
00:46:00.591 --> 00:46:02.801
You know, I think
all you have to do

809
00:46:02.802 --> 00:46:04.552
is stop and smell the roses.

810
00:46:04.553 --> 00:46:05.930
Seriously?

811
00:46:07.264 --> 00:46:08.598
This is stupid.

812
00:46:08.599 --> 00:46:11.434
- All I smell is bull...
- Shh.

813
00:46:11.435 --> 00:46:12.687
Watch.

814
00:46:15.982 --> 00:46:17.315
Don't rush through it.

815
00:46:17.316 --> 00:46:19.943
Take your time
and really appreciate

816
00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:21.612
what's right in front of you.

817
00:46:24.281 --> 00:46:27.117
Ugh. His path is so corny.

818
00:46:27.118 --> 00:46:28.994
- Gracias.
- And cheesy.

819
00:46:28.995 --> 00:46:31.246
- And lame.
- And weird, like him.

820
00:46:31.247 --> 00:46:34.040
Yeah. Why are you
so ridiculous, dog?

821
00:46:34.041 --> 00:46:35.583
What's your story?

822
00:46:35.584 --> 00:46:37.002
My story? Oh.

823
00:46:37.003 --> 00:46:39.754
It's actually
a very funny story.

824
00:46:39.755 --> 00:46:41.172
Back when I was a pup,

825
00:46:41.173 --> 00:46:43.133
me and my littermates lived
with a family.

826
00:46:43.134 --> 00:46:46.469
A family full of pranksters
who liked to play hide-and-seek,

827
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.971
and I was always it.

828
00:46:47.972 --> 00:46:50.223
Pick on the little guy,
am I right?

829
00:46:50.224 --> 00:46:53.268
They tried putting me in
a packing crate, a dumpster.

830
00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:56.771
No matter how hard they tried,
I'd always find them.

831
00:46:56.772 --> 00:46:59.190
So, one day, they get creative

832
00:46:59.191 --> 00:47:02.403
and they put me in a sock
with a rock in it.

833
00:47:03.529 --> 00:47:06.489
And then throw me in a river.

834
00:47:06.490 --> 00:47:09.159
I gnawed a hole in the sock,

835
00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:12.120
and I swam to the surface.

836
00:47:12.121 --> 00:47:14.664
Never found them
or my littermates.

837
00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.499
So I guess I'm still it.

838
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:18.001
Wow.

839
00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:21.171
That is the saddest
funny story I've ever heard.

840
00:47:21.172 --> 00:47:23.089
Well, joke's on them.

841
00:47:23.090 --> 00:47:26.134
That sock they put me in,
I grew into it.

842
00:47:26.135 --> 00:47:29.512
So, I got a great story
and a free sweater out of it.

843
00:47:29.513 --> 00:47:30.805
Win-win.

844
00:47:30.806 --> 00:47:32.307
Dude, you didn't win.

845
00:47:32.308 --> 00:47:34.392
You of all people
should have a wish.

846
00:47:34.393 --> 00:47:36.811
I already have a comfy sweater
and two best friends.

847
00:47:36.812 --> 00:47:38.438
I got everything
I could wish for.

848
00:47:38.439 --> 00:47:41.232
No magic required.

849
00:47:41.233 --> 00:47:42.526
Hmm?

850
00:47:51.911 --> 00:47:53.870
Oh, lovely.

851
00:48:00.211 --> 00:48:01.961
Oh, we're getting really close.

852
00:48:01.962 --> 00:48:05.341
I can smell two cats,
a dog and... pie?

853
00:48:06.592 --> 00:48:10.220
Well, if it isn't the idiots
who tried to steal from me.

854
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.763
Hey, he remembers us.

855
00:48:11.764 --> 00:48:14.307
Behold, Excali...

856
00:48:14.308 --> 00:48:15.809
Excali...

857
00:48:15.810 --> 00:48:19.020
Excalibur!

858
00:48:19.021 --> 00:48:20.897
Yeah, I couldn't get
this rock off of it,

859
00:48:20.898 --> 00:48:22.232
but still pretty cool, right?

860
00:48:22.233 --> 00:48:23.733
He's gaining on us!

861
00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:25.401
Okay, little left.

862
00:48:25.402 --> 00:48:26.903
That's it!

863
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:29.240
- Go faster!
- Whoa, he's up me back door.

864
00:48:32.076 --> 00:48:34.411
Goldi!

865
00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:44.754
Oh, look!

866
00:48:44.755 --> 00:48:46.923
Well, start chopping!

867
00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:49.592
On it! You don't
have to tell me twice.

868
00:48:49.593 --> 00:48:52.930
I'm gonna chop the heck
out of this Ficus lyra...

869
00:48:53.931 --> 00:48:55.975
Jerry, no!

870
00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.101
Avenge me, Jack!

871
00:48:58.102 --> 00:48:59.769
Die, die, die!

872
00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.230
Nope.

873
00:49:02.231 --> 00:49:04.774
Time to bring out the big guns.

874
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.818
Guess I overpacked.

875
00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:08.069
Magic snacks.

876
00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:09.737
Save those for later.

877
00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:12.449
Ha! Pay dirt.

878
00:49:13.325 --> 00:49:16.369
All right, magical locust,
defoliate.

879
00:49:16.370 --> 00:49:17.704
Fly and feast.

880
00:49:17.705 --> 00:49:20.206
Eat those flowers.

881
00:49:20.207 --> 00:49:22.625
I-I'm not a magic locust.

882
00:49:22.626 --> 00:49:24.669
Why, I'm not a locust at all.

883
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:27.046
What are you, then?
Some sort of demon grasshopper?

884
00:49:27.047 --> 00:49:28.798
A deadly fairy?

885
00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.508
Put a spell on the forest, then.

886
00:49:30.509 --> 00:49:32.010
I-I don't cast spells.

887
00:49:32.011 --> 00:49:34.637
- Well, what do you do?
- Well, I-I-I judge you.

888
00:49:34.638 --> 00:49:38.141
I sit on your shoulder
and judge your actions

889
00:49:38.142 --> 00:49:40.143
and the quality
of your character.

890
00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:41.811
I'm your conscience.

891
00:49:41.812 --> 00:49:43.313
I really did overpack.

892
00:49:43.314 --> 00:49:45.023
Whoa!

893
00:49:45.024 --> 00:49:46.941
Help me, Jack! Help!

894
00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:48.818
Aren't you gonna help him, Jack?

895
00:49:48.819 --> 00:49:50.361
You're losing a lot of men.

896
00:49:50.362 --> 00:49:52.363
I'm not really stressing
about the manpower.

897
00:49:52.364 --> 00:49:55.992
I've got a bottomless bag
of magic weapons.

898
00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:57.911
These babies are gonna
get me that wish

899
00:49:57.912 --> 00:50:00.914
even after the whole team
is dead and gone.

900
00:50:00.915 --> 00:50:02.998
Now, now, Jack,
as your conscience, I...

901
00:50:02.999 --> 00:50:04.792
Oh, my word!

902
00:50:04.793 --> 00:50:06.419
It's the noble phoenix.

903
00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:09.088
She's the symbol of rebirth
and the eternal...

904
00:50:09.089 --> 00:50:10.758
Oh!

905
00:50:11.967 --> 00:50:14.677
Pretty boss flamethrower, right?

906
00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:18.306
I really have my work
cut out for me on this one.

907
00:50:18.307 --> 00:50:22.353
Don't be near
where I'm flame-throwing.

908
00:50:29.026 --> 00:50:31.736
Do your job, demon flowers.

909
00:50:31.737 --> 00:50:33.364
Soon.

910
00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:39.411
Okay, Kitty,
I think I've got it now.

911
00:50:41.205 --> 00:50:43.539
- Trust me!
- Easy, easy.

912
00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.541
You're gonna give yourself
a hernia.

913
00:50:45.542 --> 00:50:47.835
Here, one more time. Like this.

914
00:50:47.836 --> 00:50:50.380
Trust me.

915
00:50:50.381 --> 00:50:52.882
Aw. But of course
I trust you and Puss,

916
00:50:52.883 --> 00:50:54.550
even without the eyes.

917
00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.552
Yeah? Big mistake.

918
00:50:56.553 --> 00:50:58.263
What do you mean?
You're my friends.

919
00:50:58.264 --> 00:51:00.223
You know what trust gets you?

920
00:51:00.224 --> 00:51:03.351
A sock, a rock
and a swim in the river.

921
00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:05.144
You have to trust
somebody, right?

922
00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:06.729
Not me. Uh-uh.

923
00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:08.356
Whenever I've let my guard down,

924
00:51:08.357 --> 00:51:11.777
I've been double-crossed,
declawed, played and betrayed.

925
00:51:12.987 --> 00:51:14.737
Never again.

926
00:51:14.738 --> 00:51:16.197
I am a solo act.

927
00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:19.575
I keep my secrets,
and I play my cards close.

928
00:51:19.576 --> 00:51:22.161
That's how you get
a winning hand.

929
00:51:22.162 --> 00:51:23.746
Take it from me.

930
00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:25.291
Never trust anyone.

931
00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.420
W-Wait.

932
00:51:30.421 --> 00:51:33.047
That's amazing.

933
00:51:33.048 --> 00:51:34.465
You're good.

934
00:51:34.466 --> 00:51:37.093
Kitty, I've been thinking.

935
00:51:37.094 --> 00:51:39.137
Ugh, thinking about what?

936
00:51:39.138 --> 00:51:41.055
My beautiful beard.

937
00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.807
It is very distinguished, yes,

938
00:51:42.808 --> 00:51:48.354
but it does deprive the world
a good look at, uh, the face.

939
00:51:48.355 --> 00:51:53.318
So, if it will make you happy,
I could be convinced to...

940
00:51:53.319 --> 00:51:54.902
- I've gotten used to it.
- Wait, what?

941
00:51:54.903 --> 00:51:56.487
The beard... keep it.

942
00:51:56.488 --> 00:52:00.199
Uh, well, you see, uh...

943
00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:02.785
Kitty, please,
get this itchy thing off of me!

944
00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.746
It's like a fever on my face!

945
00:52:04.747 --> 00:52:09.208
Hold on. Is the great
Puss in Boots asking for help?

946
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:11.085
Sí, help. You were right.

947
00:52:11.086 --> 00:52:13.546
- The beard is disgusting.
- And?

948
00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:16.841
And it's like a possum
crawled on my face.

949
00:52:16.842 --> 00:52:17.925
And?

950
00:52:17.926 --> 00:52:20.470
And died of shame.

951
00:52:20.471 --> 00:52:22.306
Okay, okay, possum face.

952
00:52:24.141 --> 00:52:26.477
I won't make you beg.

953
00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:29.812
Ow!

954
00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.022
Hey, slow down. Oh!

955
00:52:31.023 --> 00:52:32.231
Go with the grain.

956
00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:34.150
You got to go with the grain.

957
00:52:34.151 --> 00:52:35.651
- I know what I'm doing.
- Hey!

958
00:52:35.652 --> 00:52:39.155
I'm a master of the blade.
Right, Perrito?

959
00:52:39.156 --> 00:52:41.240
What? What? What's funny?

960
00:52:41.241 --> 00:52:43.285
- Nothing should be funny.
- Shh. Quieto.

961
00:52:51.585 --> 00:52:54.545
Ah, there's that handsome face
I remember.

962
00:52:54.546 --> 00:52:57.090
The face I haven't seen since...

963
00:52:57.091 --> 00:52:59.258
- Hey!
- Santa Coloma.

964
00:52:59.259 --> 00:53:02.845
Ah, yes. Santa Coloma.

965
00:53:02.846 --> 00:53:04.598
You had it coming.

966
00:53:05.682 --> 00:53:09.269
Here. You can have
my gatito blade.

967
00:53:10.187 --> 00:53:11.729
Thank you.

968
00:53:11.730 --> 00:53:13.190
Better than a stick.

969
00:53:15.526 --> 00:53:18.362
Vaya con Dios, stick sword.

970
00:53:20.572 --> 00:53:23.699
Perro, what are you doing?

971
00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.202
Perro.

972
00:53:26.203 --> 00:53:27.453
Where did that crazy dog go?

973
00:53:27.454 --> 00:53:29.038
I think you like him.

974
00:53:29.039 --> 00:53:30.456
No. No, I don't.

975
00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:32.291
I think
you're ready to name him.

976
00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.211
No, I just need his easy path
to get my wish.

977
00:53:35.212 --> 00:53:36.546
You mean my wish.

978
00:53:36.547 --> 00:53:38.799
You mean my wish!

979
00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:41.301
Sorry.

980
00:53:48.725 --> 00:53:51.060
- The Baker's Dozen.
- Let him go.

981
00:53:51.061 --> 00:53:53.229
Oh, I don't know.
I might keep him.

982
00:53:53.230 --> 00:53:55.398
Would you like a treat?

983
00:53:55.399 --> 00:53:57.400
Nice granny bag, Little Jack.

984
00:53:57.401 --> 00:53:59.193
It's not a granny bag.

985
00:53:59.194 --> 00:54:01.404
It is a magic nanny bag.

986
00:54:01.405 --> 00:54:03.406
Now, make with the map,

987
00:54:03.407 --> 00:54:07.244
or we'll see what
the unicorn horn really does.

988
00:54:08.912 --> 00:54:12.165
Y-Y-You're not gonna shoot
a puppy, are you, Jack?

989
00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:13.541
Yeah, in the face. Why?

990
00:54:13.542 --> 00:54:15.418
What the...

991
00:54:15.419 --> 00:54:17.378
Give us the map, or else

992
00:54:17.379 --> 00:54:18.713
- the baker man gets it.
- Yeah!

993
00:54:18.714 --> 00:54:21.884
I don't even have the map,
Little Bo Creep.

994
00:54:23.177 --> 00:54:25.011
Stop throwing my men at me!

995
00:54:25.012 --> 00:54:27.305
Come here!

996
00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:28.598
Puss in Boots has the map!

997
00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:31.768
Let's get him!

998
00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:35.438
I've got a plan.

999
00:54:35.439 --> 00:54:38.232
First one to the dog
gets the wish!

1000
00:54:38.233 --> 00:54:39.358
What?

1001
00:54:39.359 --> 00:54:41.612
Oh, come on!

1002
00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.832
Steady.

1003
00:54:55.209 --> 00:54:56.835
Whoa!

1004
00:54:58.295 --> 00:55:00.130
What?

1005
00:55:01.507 --> 00:55:03.257
So that's what they do. Cool.

1006
00:55:03.258 --> 00:55:05.092
No! Not cool.

1007
00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:06.887
Ah, you shot me.

1008
00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:10.015
Ah, the sight's off.

1009
00:55:11.475 --> 00:55:13.809
- I got him, Mr. Horner!
- My bad.

1010
00:55:13.810 --> 00:55:14.978
Oh, no.

1011
00:55:44.508 --> 00:55:46.259
Puss, wait!

1012
00:55:46.260 --> 00:55:48.219
Perro.

1013
00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.847
Thanks for the map, Softpaws.

1014
00:55:59.273 --> 00:56:01.107
- No, no, no!
- No!

1015
00:56:01.108 --> 00:56:05.194
Oi! You've just been crimed
by the Three Bears Crime Family.

1016
00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:07.572
- Yeah!
- So long, you plonkers!

1017
00:56:07.573 --> 00:56:10.199
!Los voy hacer a todos
alfombras de baño!

1018
00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:12.953
Puss, where are you?

1019
00:56:23.255 --> 00:56:25.382
Puss? Puss?

1020
00:56:26.925 --> 00:56:28.635
Puss!

1021
00:56:33.265 --> 00:56:34.515
Puss.

1022
00:56:34.516 --> 00:56:35.809
What's wrong?

1023
00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:11.177
Thank you, Perrito.

1024
00:57:11.178 --> 00:57:13.430
What's going on with you, Puss?

1025
00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.724
I...

1026
00:57:16.725 --> 00:57:19.602
I am down to my last life.

1027
00:57:19.603 --> 00:57:21.855
And, uh, I...

1028
00:57:23.065 --> 00:57:24.523
I am afraid.

1029
00:57:24.524 --> 00:57:27.777
Well, it's okay to be afraid.

1030
00:57:27.778 --> 00:57:29.987
No, not for Puss in Boots.

1031
00:57:29.988 --> 00:57:32.865
I-I'm supposed to be
a fearless hero.

1032
00:57:32.866 --> 00:57:34.450
A legend.

1033
00:57:34.451 --> 00:57:39.705
But without lives to spare,
I am nothing.

1034
00:57:39.706 --> 00:57:42.500
I need that wish
to get my lives back.

1035
00:57:42.501 --> 00:57:43.751
You should tell Kitty.

1036
00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:45.419
- She would understa...
- No, no, no, no.

1037
00:57:45.420 --> 00:57:47.171
She cannot hear of this.

1038
00:57:47.172 --> 00:57:48.173
Okay.

1039
00:57:49.675 --> 00:57:50.966
¿Adónde fueron ese idiota
y su perro?

1040
00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:52.802
Kitty will never trust me again.

1041
00:57:52.803 --> 00:57:54.804
Not after Santa Coloma.

1042
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:57.056
But that's just one bad heist.

1043
00:57:57.057 --> 00:58:00.393
Santa Coloma wasn't a heist,
Perrito.

1044
00:58:00.394 --> 00:58:05.648
It was a church,
with a priest and guests.

1045
00:58:05.649 --> 00:58:07.525
And Kitty.

1046
00:58:07.526 --> 00:58:11.028
Everything but me.

1047
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:12.988
I ran away then, too.

1048
00:58:12.989 --> 00:58:15.408
Oh. Oh.

1049
00:58:15.409 --> 00:58:17.410
Oh!

1050
00:58:17.411 --> 00:58:20.079
You left her at the altar?

1051
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.288
It was wrong. I know.

1052
00:58:21.289 --> 00:58:23.624
I am ashamed.

1053
00:58:23.625 --> 00:58:27.461
I just wish I hadn't
hurt her so badly.

1054
00:58:27.462 --> 00:58:29.631
I regret that day.

1055
00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:32.842
So, maybe you should
tell that to Kitty.

1056
00:58:32.843 --> 00:58:35.720
Might make you feel better.

1057
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:38.724
Might make her feel better, too.

1058
00:58:40.851 --> 00:58:42.685
Puss! Dog!

1059
00:58:42.686 --> 00:58:44.353
Oh, there you are.

1060
00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:45.646
What happened back there?

1061
00:58:45.647 --> 00:58:48.023
Kitty. I lost the map.

1062
00:58:48.024 --> 00:58:49.275
I messed up.

1063
00:58:49.276 --> 00:58:50.609
We'll get it back.

1064
00:58:50.610 --> 00:58:51.777
We've been in worse pickles.

1065
00:58:51.778 --> 00:58:53.404
Who told you that name?

1066
00:58:53.405 --> 00:58:54.530
What name?

1067
00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:56.407
Uh, nothing.

1068
00:58:56.408 --> 00:59:01.788
The bears! We have to find them
before they find the star.

1069
00:59:02.873 --> 00:59:05.207
Oh! We are so close.

1070
00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.376
It's finally happening.

1071
00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:09.420
I can taste that wish now.

1072
00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:11.464
And you know
what it tastes like?

1073
00:59:11.465 --> 00:59:13.257
- Pies?
- ♪ Pies ♪

1074
00:59:13.258 --> 00:59:16.051
♪ Who ate all the pies?
Who ate all the pies? ♪

1075
00:59:16.052 --> 00:59:18.345
♪ We did, we did,
we did, we did ♪

1076
00:59:18.346 --> 00:59:19.847
♪ We ate all the pies. ♪

1077
00:59:19.848 --> 00:59:21.724
Oh, it's gonna be wicked.

1078
00:59:21.725 --> 00:59:26.061
Yeah. Imagine us,
a big-time crime syndicate.

1079
00:59:26.062 --> 00:59:28.731
Not a big-time
crime syndicate, love.

1080
00:59:28.732 --> 00:59:31.233
A big-time crime family.

1081
00:59:31.234 --> 00:59:33.194
Isn't that right, Goldi?

1082
00:59:33.195 --> 00:59:34.237
- Goldi?
- What?

1083
00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:37.490
Whoa! Hey, look,
the map is going all fizzly.

1084
00:59:37.491 --> 00:59:38.741
What did you do?

1085
00:59:38.742 --> 00:59:40.660
- Give it me. No, no, no, no.
- Hey!

1086
00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.413
Goldi, no biting!

1087
00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:47.082
You're the smash, I'm the grab.

1088
00:59:47.083 --> 00:59:48.292
I hold the map.

1089
00:59:48.293 --> 00:59:49.503
- You got it?
- Okay!

1090
00:59:51.797 --> 00:59:54.673
"To find your wish,
adjust your view.

1091
00:59:54.674 --> 00:59:57.426
What you seek
may be right in front of you."

1092
00:59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.305
Well, that's a load of rubbish.
What's that supposed to mean?

1093
01:00:01.473 --> 01:00:03.641
Right in front of us.

1094
01:00:03.642 --> 01:00:05.434
It looks like
our cabin back home.

1095
01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.727
You really think our cabin

1096
01:00:06.728 --> 01:00:08.437
is in the middle
of the Dark Forest?

1097
01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:10.773
Baby, give it
the old sniff test.

1098
01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:13.108
Something's cooking.

1099
01:00:13.109 --> 01:00:15.277
No.

1100
01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:16.862
Do not open that door.

1101
01:00:16.863 --> 01:00:19.448
We are home! Hello, door.

1102
01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:20.950
Oh, no, don't go insi...

1103
01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:22.618
Maybe just a quick pop in.

1104
01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:25.037
- Hello, chairs.
- What say we hibernate?

1105
01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.455
Hello, honey.

1106
01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.624
Hello, my old friend.

1107
01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:31.378
I have missed you so...

1108
01:00:33.129 --> 01:00:35.297
Look, Goldi. Porridge.

1109
01:00:35.298 --> 01:00:37.800
And it's made
just the way you like it.

1110
01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:39.885
No matter how you make it,
she doesn't like it.

1111
01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.554
Stop it, all of you.

1112
01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:43.472
Maybe our wishes
have been granted.

1113
01:00:43.473 --> 01:00:45.808
Just stop.
It's not our wish granted.

1114
01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:46.892
It's an obstacle.

1115
01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:49.854
It's the forest playing tricks.

1116
01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.107
This isn't real.
None of this is...

1117
01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:05.119
Aw. That was your favorite book.

1118
01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.081
You used to stare at it
for hours.

1119
01:01:24.723 --> 01:01:26.557
Too hard.

1120
01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:28.059
Whoop!

1121
01:01:29.144 --> 01:01:30.478
Too soft.

1122
01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.986
Just right.

1123
01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:40.654
Oh, this was it.

1124
01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:41.947
What was it, Mama?

1125
01:01:41.948 --> 01:01:43.699
The day a little orphan girl

1126
01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:46.703
broke into our cabin
and stole our hearts.

1127
01:01:50.707 --> 01:01:54.961
The day when our world
became just right.

1128
01:01:58.423 --> 01:02:02.551
How's it going?
Can you see anything up there?

1129
01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:04.678
Not yet, Perrito...

1130
01:02:04.679 --> 01:02:06.847
- You okay?
- Sí, I am good.

1131
01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:08.683
So good.

1132
01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.899
If you wanted to hold my hand,
all you had to do is ask.

1133
01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:19.902
Uh, just, uh,
feel free to pull me up

1134
01:02:19.903 --> 01:02:21.779
whenever you get a chance.

1135
01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:24.114
Oh, I was just remembering

1136
01:02:24.115 --> 01:02:26.742
the last time
I offered you my hand.

1137
01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:29.746
Only, that time,
I believe you had cold feet.

1138
01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.420
Kitty...

1139
01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.258
About that day.

1140
01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:46.428
Puss in Boots is not
supposed to be afraid.

1141
01:02:46.429 --> 01:02:50.766
But outside that church
in Santa Coloma,

1142
01:02:50.767 --> 01:02:56.230
that was the first time
I ever felt fear.

1143
01:02:56.231 --> 01:02:59.150
So I ran.

1144
01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:03.278
It was a mistake, Kitty.

1145
01:03:03.279 --> 01:03:04.655
It's okay.

1146
01:03:04.656 --> 01:03:06.907
- No, no. It was cowardly.
- It's okay.

1147
01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:08.951
- You alone at the altar.
- Puss.

1148
01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:11.286
In your beautiful,
poofy wedding dress.

1149
01:03:11.287 --> 01:03:14.039
Puss! It's okay.

1150
01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.291
I didn't show up, either.

1151
01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:17.793
Wait, what?

1152
01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.962
What do you mean,
you didn't show up?

1153
01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:22.339
Well, I knew
I could never compete

1154
01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:24.299
with your one true love.

1155
01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:26.301
- Who?
- Yourself.

1156
01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.386
The legend.

1157
01:03:27.387 --> 01:03:28.679
Uh...

1158
01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.974
I wasn't gonna show up
for that guy.

1159
01:03:32.308 --> 01:03:35.353
But you don't seem
like that guy anymore.

1160
01:03:38.523 --> 01:03:40.816
Everything okay up there?

1161
01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.943
I'm giving you a thumbs-up,
just so you know.

1162
01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.529
Puss!

1163
01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.324
Look.

1164
01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.286
What do you think, bug?

1165
01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:54.872
Do I wait for the cats to steal
the map and then kill them,

1166
01:03:54.873 --> 01:03:57.249
or do I just kill everybody
all at once?

1167
01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.334
You know, I'm starting to think

1168
01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.920
you don't appreciate
the value of a life.

1169
01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.505
What? No.

1170
01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:04.924
I mean, I love these guys.

1171
01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.511
Flex the glutes.
I need a solid surface.

1172
01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:12.056
There's good in all people.
There's good in all people.

1173
01:04:12.057 --> 01:04:15.017
You know, Jack, maybe we need
to dig a little deeper.

1174
01:04:15.018 --> 01:04:17.479
T-Tell me about your childhood.

1175
01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:21.356
You know,
I never had much as a kid.

1176
01:04:21.357 --> 01:04:25.360
Just loving parents
and stability and a mansion

1177
01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:28.906
and a thriving baked goods
enterprise for me to inherit.

1178
01:04:28.907 --> 01:04:31.159
Useless crap like that.

1179
01:04:32.786 --> 01:04:34.745
But once I get my wish,

1180
01:04:34.746 --> 01:04:38.874
I'll finally have the one thing
that will make me happy.

1181
01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:41.085
Oh, well, what's that?

1182
01:04:41.086 --> 01:04:43.295
All of the magic in the world.

1183
01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.005
For me.

1184
01:04:45.006 --> 01:04:47.049
And no one else gets any.

1185
01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:49.051
- Is that so much?
- Yes!

1186
01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.719
Agree to disagree.

1187
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.472
All right, bring it over.

1188
01:04:59.312 --> 01:05:00.938
Help!

1189
01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:03.857
Sweet Mother of Goose, Jack!

1190
01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.567
Well, you know what they say.

1191
01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:08.487
Can't bake a pie
without losing a dozen men.

1192
01:05:08.488 --> 01:05:11.406
Oh. Oh!

1193
01:05:11.407 --> 01:05:12.950
That was horrible.

1194
01:05:12.951 --> 01:05:14.701
Your wish is horrible.

1195
01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:15.869
You're horrible!

1196
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:18.288
You're an irredeemable monster!

1197
01:05:18.289 --> 01:05:21.501
Oh, oh.
What took you so long, idiot?

1198
01:05:23.837 --> 01:05:25.462
You're not chatty, are you?

1199
01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:26.965
Mm-mm.

1200
01:05:28.591 --> 01:05:31.426
Okay, you take the window,
I'll take the chimney.

1201
01:05:31.427 --> 01:05:32.594
What do I take?

1202
01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:34.054
Oh, you take it easy, Perrito.

1203
01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:35.889
We need you
to stay here and, uh...

1204
01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:37.599
- Uh, uh, guard our rear.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1205
01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:40.394
On your six. Got your rears
eyeballed and covered.

1206
01:05:40.395 --> 01:05:41.645
Hands in, crew.

1207
01:05:41.646 --> 01:05:42.855
Ready?

1208
01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.731
Go, Team Friendship!

1209
01:05:44.732 --> 01:05:46.024
Team Friendship?

1210
01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:47.609
I did not agree to this.

1211
01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:49.820
Yeah, do better. Try harder.

1212
01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:50.988
Well, just a placeholder name,
you know.

1213
01:05:50.989 --> 01:05:52.156
I'll workshop it, okay?

1214
01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:53.407
- Go get 'em, tiger.
- Hey!

1215
01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.535
Take it easy.

1216
01:05:57.662 --> 01:05:58.996
Ready to get our wish back?

1217
01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:00.539
"Our wish"?

1218
01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:03.917
Well, I've been thinking,
if you play your cards right,

1219
01:06:03.918 --> 01:06:07.005
maybe we could share the wish.

1220
01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:10.383
Share the wish.

1221
01:06:28.026 --> 01:06:30.027
It's gone!

1222
01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.236
Wake up.

1223
01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:32.613
Someone's nicked the map.

1224
01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.573
What's all this?
What's all this bother about?

1225
01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:35.949
Oi! Did you not hear her?

1226
01:06:35.950 --> 01:06:37.576
The map is missing.

1227
01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:40.329
Somebody took it.

1228
01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.496
Hola.

1229
01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:44.166
Oi! You criming us
when we just crimed you?

1230
01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:45.834
No, no crime-backs.

1231
01:06:45.835 --> 01:06:47.836
Oh, you're dead cat meat.

1232
01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:49.630
Okay, okay, okay.

1233
01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.840
It's all... yours!

1234
01:06:51.841 --> 01:06:54.134
Nowhere to go, Softpaws.

1235
01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:57.513
Really? Let's see
what the map has to say.

1236
01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:00.432
No!

1237
01:07:00.433 --> 01:07:02.601
- Our cabin!
- My honey!

1238
01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:04.520
What the dickens?

1239
01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:07.315
Oh, no, you don't.

1240
01:07:12.153 --> 01:07:14.239
Oh, no.

1241
01:07:21.246 --> 01:07:23.080
- We're coming, Gol...
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

1242
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:24.414
- Get off me, you big lump.
- Hold still.

1243
01:07:24.415 --> 01:07:26.501
Hold on! I'm coming, Team...

1244
01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:29.921
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry,
sorry, sorry!

1245
01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:33.340
Uh-oh.

1246
01:07:33.341 --> 01:07:35.718
- Shall we dance? I'll lead.
- Huh? Wha...

1247
01:07:36.678 --> 01:07:38.763
Aah! Too hot!

1248
01:07:40.848 --> 01:07:44.060
Aah! Too cold! Brain freeze.

1249
01:07:48.439 --> 01:07:50.984
Oh, that is just right.

1250
01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:06.499
Aye? What the...

1251
01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.181
No!

1252
01:08:25.226 --> 01:08:28.062
Oi! Forget something?

1253
01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:37.362
They got Perrito!

1254
01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:39.407
Don't worry,
we can track them with this.

1255
01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:42.744
Wait, stop!

1256
01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:49.667
Puss, watch out!

1257
01:08:50.793 --> 01:08:52.419
Kitty!

1258
01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:53.671
Puss!

1259
01:08:57.133 --> 01:08:58.593
Look!

1260
01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.472
There, there they are.
Just out there.

1261
01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:05.767
You go get Perrito.
I'll find a way out of here.

1262
01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.705
Puss.

1263
01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:35.504
Hey, good-looking.

1264
01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:36.963
What is that?

1265
01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:39.174
Why so jumpy, amigo?

1266
01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:40.884
Whoa, what's happening?

1267
01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:42.928
Hello, Puss. Gazpacho?

1268
01:09:42.929 --> 01:09:44.429
Long time, no see.

1269
01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:47.015

You know what?

1274
01:09:55.483 --> 01:09:57.234
I love you guys.

1275
01:09:57.235 --> 01:10:00.112
So, you are my former lives?

1276
01:10:00.113 --> 01:10:02.697
Reflections of
the good old days.

1277
01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:04.366
Okay.

1278
01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.034
Back when we were
larger than life.

1279
01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:08.078

Game over, innit?

1287
01:10:28.349 --> 01:10:29.975
Them cats stole
the stolen map we stole,

1288
01:10:29.976 --> 01:10:32.227
and we ended up with
diddly-squat... nothing.

1289
01:10:32.228 --> 01:10:36.231
Or maybe we could be happy
without a wish.

1290
01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:38.817
What are we doing?
They ain't coming back.

1291
01:10:38.818 --> 01:10:40.569
Goodbye, purple trousers.

1292
01:10:40.570 --> 01:10:43.071
Oh, they'll come back... for him.

1293
01:10:43.072 --> 01:10:45.073
You're darn tootin'.

1294
01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:47.451
Puss and Kitty always rescue me
when I'm kidnapped...

1295
01:10:47.452 --> 01:10:49.286
Which happens a lot...

1296
01:10:49.287 --> 01:10:51.246
'cause we're a team.

1297
01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.206
- Aw, that's lovely.
- Yep.

1298
01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.541
Team Friendship.

1299
01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.543
Ugh. No! That is a crap name.

1300
01:10:56.544 --> 01:10:58.420
Well, we're-we're...
we're still workshopping it.

1301
01:10:58.421 --> 01:11:00.922
Oh, them cats ain't gonna
risk their lives

1302
01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:02.424
for this daft little pup.

1303
01:11:02.425 --> 01:11:04.551
You're just saying that
because you want to eat 'im.

1304
01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:08.138
I do not. I just want
to pet him with my teeth.

1305
01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:10.140
Stop thinking about
your belly, Baby.

1306
01:11:10.141 --> 01:11:12.851
In fact, stop thinking, period.

1307
01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.978
You'll just hurt yourself,
you muppet.

1308
01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:16.313
"Muppet."

1309
01:11:16.314 --> 01:11:17.814
And why would I listen to

1310
01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:20.692
a porridge-stealing orphan
like you?

1311
01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.819
- You're not even a bear.
- Zing!

1312
01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:25.071
I'm more of a bear than you are.

1313
01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:26.948
She got you.

1314
01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:29.659
You're nothing but
a low-rent Cinderella.

1315
01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:30.785
Oh!

1316
01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:32.245
Well, that's rich
coming from you, Baby,

1317
01:11:32.246 --> 01:11:33.788
'cause you know what you are?

1318
01:11:33.789 --> 01:11:34.540
Wait for it.

1319
01:11:34.541 --> 01:11:36.208
You're a daft, fat,

1320
01:11:36.209 --> 01:11:38.502
slow-thinking,
no-reading, Lyme-diseased,

1321
01:11:38.503 --> 01:11:40.170
flea-ridden dingleberry bear.

1322
01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:41.296
Boom!

1323
01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.006
I haven't got dingleberries.

1324
01:11:43.007 --> 01:11:44.966
No, you do. You do have 'em.

1325
01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.134
Dingleberries!

1326
01:11:46.135 --> 01:11:47.552
Oi! You shut up,
you little mutt,

1327
01:11:47.553 --> 01:11:49.471
or I'll cut you
from pooper to snooter!

1328
01:11:49.472 --> 01:11:51.973
I'm in the mix now.

1329
01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:53.892
Okay! Okay, here we go.

1330
01:11:53.893 --> 01:11:56.394
You're all a bunch
of knuckle-dragging,

1331
01:11:56.395 --> 01:11:58.313
honey-scrounging, grub,

1332
01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.357
oafish, munching,

1333
01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:01.775
mangy nugget,

1335
01:12:03.110 --> 01:12:05.488
And your snooter!

1336
01:12:06.364 --> 01:12:08.281
I like the cut of his jib.

1337
01:12:08.282 --> 01:12:10.033
Ah, this is great.

1338
01:12:10.034 --> 01:12:14.663
Razzin' and ribbin' and barbin'
and poopin' and snootin'.

1339
01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:18.250
Oh, I wish I had
a family like this.

1340
01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:20.418
Speaking from one orphan
to another, Goldi,

1341
01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:23.005
you won the orphan lottery.

1342
01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.174
I like his jib as well.

1343
01:12:26.175 --> 01:12:28.093
- Let's keep him.
- What?

1344
01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:30.470
Huh? Where'd he go?

1345
01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:33.057
- No! We said no crime-backs.
- No, Baby, wait!

1346
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:36.560

This has been fun, huh?

1352
01:12:48.614 --> 01:12:51.199
Yeah, but could you tell me
how to get out of here?

1353
01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:53.077
I've got to get back
to Dog and Kitty.

1354
01:12:53.995 --> 01:12:56.288
Whoa! I thought you were going
to get the wish.

1355
01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:58.790
You got the map.
You don't need them.

1356
01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.500
Yeah, get those lives back.

1357
01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:04.213
Become the legend again,
town to town.

1358
01:13:05.715 --> 01:13:09.175
Party to party.

1359
01:13:09.176 --> 01:13:12.054
Puss in Boots walks alone.

1360
01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:20.646
Yeah, Puss in Boots walks alone.

1361
01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:26.736
Was the legend so big there was
no room for anyone else?

1362
01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:32.574
Oh, the legend's
still big, gato.

1363
01:13:32.575 --> 01:13:34.242
It's you that got small.

1364
01:13:34.243 --> 01:13:36.411
Yeah, you changed, man.

1365
01:13:36.412 --> 01:13:38.455
I hear he's best friends
with a dog now.

1366
01:13:38.456 --> 01:13:40.332
And he doesn't even
have a sword.

1367
01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:42.459
Some hero.

1368
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:44.586
You've become a scaredy-cat.

1369
01:13:44.587 --> 01:13:46.421
We should call him
Wuss in Boots.

1370
01:13:46.422 --> 01:13:47.756
Ah, no, no, no, no.

1371
01:13:47.757 --> 01:13:50.258
Didn't you hear?
His new name is Pickles.

1372
01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:51.926
So lame.

1373
01:13:51.927 --> 01:13:54.346
Where is your litter box,
Pickles?

1374
01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:56.431
You know what?
You guys are jerks.

1375
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.433
Which is very conflicting
for me.

1376
01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.101
I'll find my own way out. Adios.

1377
01:14:00.102 --> 01:14:02.479
Oh, you think you are
better than us?

1378
01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:05.857
Without us, you will always
live a life of...

1379
01:14:05.858 --> 01:14:07.817
Fear.

1380
01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:08.818
You.

1381
01:14:08.819 --> 01:14:11.696
I do love the smell of fear.

1382
01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:13.615
It's intoxicating.

1383
01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:15.158
It is?

1384
01:14:15.159 --> 01:14:18.536
Sorry to crash the party
with your past lives.

1385
01:14:18.537 --> 01:14:20.580
Or your past deaths,

1386
01:14:20.581 --> 01:14:22.625
as I like to call them.

1387
01:14:23.584 --> 01:14:27.295
I was there
to witness all of them.

1388
01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:30.840
Each frivolous end.

1389
01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:35.220
But you didn't even notice me

1390
01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:41.644
because Puss in Boots laughs
in the face of death, right?

1391
01:14:42.645 --> 01:14:45.481
But you're not laughing now.

1392
01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.483
You are no bounty hunter.

1393
01:14:48.484 --> 01:14:50.068
You are...

1394
01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.488
Death.

1395
01:14:54.490 --> 01:14:55.990
And I don't mean it
metaphorically

1396
01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:58.868
or rhetorically or poetically
or theoretically

1397
01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.830
or in any other fancy way.

1398
01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:05.333
I'm Death, straight up.

1399
01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:08.294
And I've come for you,
Puss in Boots.

1400
01:15:08.295 --> 01:15:10.171
But I'm still alive.

1401
01:15:10.172 --> 01:15:11.673
You know...

1402
01:15:11.674 --> 01:15:13.842
I'm not a cat person.

1403
01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:18.847
I find the very idea
of nine lives absurd.

1404
01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:21.975
And you didn't value
any of them.

1405
01:15:21.976 --> 01:15:25.186
So, why don't I do us
both a favor

1406
01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.605
and take this last one now?

1407
01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.357
That's cheating!

1408
01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.025
Shh. Don't tell.

1409
01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:32.861
Run, Puss in Boots!

1410
01:15:32.862 --> 01:15:34.571
Make the wish!

1411
01:15:34.572 --> 01:15:36.614
Go ahead, run for it.

1412
01:15:36.615 --> 01:15:39.534
Makes it more fun for me.

1413
01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:56.969
Run.

1414
01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:00.139
Run.

1415
01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.183
Hey, Puss.

1416
01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:04.559
Run.

1417
01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.729
Puss! Puss, we're here!

1418
01:16:09.732 --> 01:16:12.067
Wh-Where's he going?

1419
01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.007
That's the third time

1420
01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:19.801
we've passed
that same rock, Baby.

1421
01:17:19.802 --> 01:17:21.261
Oh, not again.

1422
01:17:21.262 --> 01:17:22.554
What do you want me to do?

1423
01:17:22.555 --> 01:17:24.180
I've lost the scent.

1424
01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:25.974
You only have one job.

1425
01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:29.143
The one thing that makes you
mildly useful is your nose,

1426
01:17:29.144 --> 01:17:31.521
and apparently,
you can't even use that.

1427
01:17:31.522 --> 01:17:32.939
- Goldi.
- I'm starting to think

1428
01:17:32.940 --> 01:17:34.649
this wish isn't
what you promised us.

1429
01:17:34.650 --> 01:17:37.110
- Leave off, Baby.
- So, what is it, eh?

1430
01:17:37.111 --> 01:17:40.071
What's your "just right"?
What's so blasted important

1431
01:17:40.072 --> 01:17:42.615
that you've got us stranded
in this haunted forest?

1432
01:17:42.616 --> 01:17:44.659
I'm getting a family!
That's what.

1433
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:46.035
A proper family.

1434
01:17:46.036 --> 01:17:49.206
Then everything
will be just right.

1435
01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:56.045
Your "just right"
is getting rid of us?

1436
01:17:56.046 --> 01:17:58.715
Well, I guess some people
just stick around

1437
01:17:58.716 --> 01:18:01.760
until the porridge is gone,
eh, Goldi?

1438
01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.139
Come on.

1439
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.434
You didn't think
I would actually stay.

1440
01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:11.103
I'm not a bear.

1441
01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:22.990
I was always afraid
it was too good to last.

1442
01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:25.867
And whether you think
we're your family or not,

1443
01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:29.537
if this is something
that will make you happy,

1444
01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:31.623
we'll get you that wish.

1445
01:18:31.624 --> 01:18:33.876
Come on, boys.

1446
01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:45.054
Oh, what a good boy am I.

1447
01:18:52.937 --> 01:18:56.022
"Star light, star bright,

1448
01:18:56.023 --> 01:18:58.733
"first star I see tonight,

1449
01:18:58.734 --> 01:18:59.984
I wish..."

1450
01:18:59.985 --> 01:19:01.402
I can't believe
I fell for it again.

1451
01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:03.404
Kitty, you don't understand.

1452
01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.239
Don't understand what?

1453
01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.742
That you've been playing me
this whole time?

1454
01:19:07.743 --> 01:19:09.327
I need this wish.

1455
01:19:09.328 --> 01:19:12.289
Oh, yeah? You want to know
what my wish was?

1456
01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:16.000
Someone, anyone I could trust.

1457
01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.293
Hey!

1458
01:19:17.294 --> 01:19:20.129
In my whole life,
I've never had that.

1459
01:19:20.130 --> 01:19:23.549
But I thought I finally found
that someone

1460
01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:25.969
without a wish.

1461
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:27.930
I thought it was you.

1462
01:19:29.098 --> 01:19:30.848
But you're still running.

1463
01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:33.685
Still the same old
Puss in Boots.

1464
01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:36.187
But I am not!
I am not Puss in Boots.

1465
01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:37.772
I'm...

1466
01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.565
I am on my last life.

1467
01:19:39.566 --> 01:19:42.151
I need to get my lives back.

1468
01:19:42.152 --> 01:19:45.530
Without them, I am not...
I-I am not...

1469
01:19:45.531 --> 01:19:47.074
What? The legend?

1470
01:19:50.244 --> 01:19:53.913
I still can't compete
with your one true love.

1471
01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:56.250
Go on, get your lives back.

1472
01:19:57.876 --> 01:20:00.004
Just keep them out of mine.

1473
01:20:04.049 --> 01:20:06.676
Kitty, Death is after me!

1474
01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:08.219
What?

1475
01:20:08.220 --> 01:20:10.304
I've been called
a lot of things...

1476
01:20:10.305 --> 01:20:11.806
but never Death.

1477
01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.141
I like it.

1478
01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:15.477
- That's my wish!
- Oi!

1479
01:20:16.478 --> 01:20:18.480
That's Goldi's wish.

1480
01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:56.018
Grab him!

1481
01:20:57.227 --> 01:20:58.853
Move! Out of my way!

1482
01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.814
I've got it! I've got it!
Don't got it.

1483
01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:04.193
That's mine.

1484
01:21:10.616 --> 01:21:11.867
Bang, bang, bang!

1485
01:21:13.994 --> 01:21:16.330
Oh, come on.
You walked into that one.

1486
01:21:18.540 --> 01:21:20.458
Mr. Horner, I need your help!

1487
01:21:20.459 --> 01:21:23.336
Duly noted, but a little busy
at the moment.

1488
01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:24.545
Pew, pew!

1489
01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:27.257
Mr. Horner!

1490
01:21:34.181 --> 01:21:35.556
Ooh.

1491
01:21:35.557 --> 01:21:38.268
Aha! It's bear season.

1492
01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:41.729
Oi, I'm gonna bust you up,
plum thumb,

1493
01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:43.815
and then I'm gonna
wear your clothes.

1494
01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:45.234
That was weird.

1495
01:21:47.069 --> 01:21:49.237
No, no, no...

1496
01:21:49.238 --> 01:21:50.197
Baby!

1497
01:21:50.198 --> 01:21:51.906
- Mama, help!
- I got you!

1498
01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:53.866
- Papa!
- Son, I'm coming!

1499
01:21:53.867 --> 01:21:55.493
- Got you.
- Help!

1500
01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:57.954
- Hold on!
- Something's happening!

1501
01:21:57.955 --> 01:21:59.331
Help me!

1502
01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:03.584
Help! No, no, no!

1503
01:22:03.585 --> 01:22:05.419
Hang on, son!

1504
01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:07.839
I can't stop it!

1505
01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:09.173
Mama, I'm slipping!

1506
01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:11.677
I'm slipping...

1507
01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:19.350
Like I told you, Baby,
you're the smash, I'm the grab.

1508
01:22:19.351 --> 01:22:21.520
Yes! Yes!

1509
01:22:24.273 --> 01:22:25.983
No!

1510
01:22:31.446 --> 01:22:34.949
Hey, Softpaws,
how do you like these apples?

1511
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:38.245
Die! Blow up already.

1512
01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:40.998
Softpaws.

1513
01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:43.791
Okay.

1514
01:22:43.792 --> 01:22:48.297
Okay, you know, maybe it's time
to bury the hatchet!

1515
01:22:49.965 --> 01:22:53.302
Oh, I shouldn't have
telegraphed it!

1516
01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.896
Yeah, I don't know
what to do with this,

1517
01:23:04.897 --> 01:23:07.815
but if you think
you need those lives...

1518
01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:10.027
Thank you, Perrito.

1519
01:23:10.903 --> 01:23:13.446
You know,
I've only ever had one life,

1520
01:23:13.447 --> 01:23:16.407
but sharing it
with you and Kitty

1521
01:23:16.408 --> 01:23:18.576
has made it pretty special.

1522
01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:21.997
Maybe one life is enough.

1523
01:23:29.838 --> 01:23:32.174
- Huh?
- What is that?

1524
01:23:38.430 --> 01:23:39.556
Who's that?

1525
01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.018
He's here for me.

1526
01:23:48.523 --> 01:23:50.442
Puss!

1527
01:23:54.905 --> 01:23:57.114
I've enjoyed the chase, gato,

1528
01:23:57.115 --> 01:24:00.035
but I think we've reached
the end now, you and I.

1529
01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:04.205
You gonna take
the coward's way out?

1530
01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:07.083
Run away to more lives?

1531
01:24:07.084 --> 01:24:09.378
Or are you gonna fight?

1532
01:24:14.591 --> 01:24:16.718
Pick it up.

1533
01:24:17.678 --> 01:24:19.387
Go on, pick it up.

1534
01:24:36.738 --> 01:24:38.281
What's the matter?

1535
01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.992
Lives flashing before your eyes?

1536
01:24:40.993 --> 01:24:42.785
No.

1537
01:24:42.786 --> 01:24:44.245
Just one.

1538
01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.206
I'm done running.

1539
01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:53.213
Fear me, if you dare.

1540
01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:57.092
This is gonna be fun.

1541
01:25:16.611 --> 01:25:18.154
Bien.

1542
01:25:18.155 --> 01:25:20.198
Muy bien.

1543
01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:40.594
You really got to stop
losing that.

1544
01:25:54.232 --> 01:25:57.152
Say hello to my gatito blade.

1545
01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:02.991
Come on!

1546
01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:24.554
Pick it up.

1547
01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:28.808
I know I can never
defeat you, lobo,

1548
01:26:28.809 --> 01:26:32.479
but I will never stop fighting
for this life.

1549
01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:57.044
¿Por qué diablos fui a jugar
con mi comida?

1550
01:26:57.045 --> 01:26:59.880
You're ruining this for me.

1551
01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:03.551
I came here for
an arrogant little legend

1552
01:27:03.552 --> 01:27:05.887
who thought he was immortal.

1553
01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:10.225
But I don't see him anymore.

1554
01:27:14.312 --> 01:27:16.856
Live your life, Puss in Boots.

1555
01:27:16.857 --> 01:27:18.358
Live it well.

1556
01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:24.905
You know we will
meet again, right?

1557
01:27:24.906 --> 01:27:27.826
Sí. Hasta la muerte.

1558
01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:41.297
You know,

1559
01:27:41.298 --> 01:27:43.299
when you said
Death was after you,

1560
01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.344
I thought you were just
being melodramatic.

1561
01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:48.429
The wish is yours.

1562
01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:51.683
You deserve someone
you can trust.

1563
01:27:56.188 --> 01:27:57.646
I don't need it.

1564
01:27:57.647 --> 01:27:59.482
I've got what I wished for.

1565
01:27:59.483 --> 01:28:01.526
No magic required.

1566
01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:15.165
Ah, magic snacks.

1567
01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:22.838
Holy frijoles.

1568
01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:25.508
I was worried for a second
I would come out naked,

1569
01:28:25.509 --> 01:28:28.969
but my clothes grew, too. Cool.

1570
01:28:28.970 --> 01:28:31.014
Thank you.

1571
01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.141
Gotcha.

1572
01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.310
The last wish.

1573
01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.647
It's mine.

1574
01:28:39.439 --> 01:28:41.565
"Star light, star bright,

1575
01:28:41.566 --> 01:28:43.859
first star I see tonight..."

1576
01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:45.486
Perrito!

1577
01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:48.656
"I wish I may, I wish I might

1578
01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:51.742
- have this wish..." Huh?
- Señor Horner!

1579
01:28:51.743 --> 01:28:54.704
Please don't make that wish.
Please?

1580
01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:57.164
Please?

1581
01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:58.332
Wh-What are you doing?

1582
01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:00.501
Please...

1583
01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:02.545
Seriously, are you having
a hernia or something?

1584
01:29:02.546 --> 01:29:06.675
Pretty please...

1585
01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:11.555
They're such pools
of vulnerability.

1586
01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:15.516
It's so cute...

1587
01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:18.060
how you think
that would work on me.

1588
01:29:18.061 --> 01:29:19.687
Don't you know I'm dead inside?

1589
01:29:19.688 --> 01:29:21.939
By the way,
your nose is bleeding.

1590
01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:23.399
Oh.

1591
01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:27.070
I was just buying some time
for Team Friendship.

1592
01:29:28.363 --> 01:29:29.948
Team what?

1593
01:29:38.665 --> 01:29:40.916
Spanish Splinter!

1594
01:29:40.917 --> 01:29:43.587
Ow!

1595
01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:47.882
Hey!

1596
01:29:52.220 --> 01:29:55.556
What have you done? No!

1597
01:29:55.557 --> 01:29:57.391
The map. My wish.

1598
01:29:57.392 --> 01:29:58.643
Go, go, go!

1599
01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:01.730
Whoa!

1600
01:30:02.939 --> 01:30:04.149
It's mine.

1601
01:30:05.650 --> 01:30:06.817
Huh?

1602
01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:08.861
You looking for something?

1603
01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:11.740
Consider this
my resignation, mister.

1604
01:30:14.701 --> 01:30:15.826
What?

1605
01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:19.581
What did I do to deserve this?

1606
01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:23.752
I mean, what specifically...?

1607
01:30:33.928 --> 01:30:35.680
Gorgeous.

1608
01:30:36.723 --> 01:30:40.809
I hate to say it,
but should we make a wish?

1609
01:30:40.810 --> 01:30:44.647
Kitty, one life spent with you

1610
01:30:44.648 --> 01:30:46.941
is all that I could wish for.

1611
01:30:57.494 --> 01:30:59.828
You saved my life, sis.

1612
01:30:59.829 --> 01:31:01.830
You was gonna make the wish,
but you didn't make the wish

1613
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.457
'cause you wanted
to save your family.

1614
01:31:03.458 --> 01:31:05.250
And I-I was really scared.

1615
01:31:05.251 --> 01:31:06.585
And then...

1616
01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.462
Oi, don't get
so blubbery about it.

1617
01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:10.130
Whose porridge would I eat
otherwise?

1618
01:31:10.131 --> 01:31:13.217
I'm sorry you didn't get
your wish, Goldi, love.

1619
01:31:13.218 --> 01:31:14.385
But I did, Mama.

1620
01:31:14.386 --> 01:31:16.345
I did get my wish.

1621
01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.305
Everything...

1622
01:31:18.306 --> 01:31:20.974
is just right.

1623
01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:22.142
Oh.

1624
01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:23.811
Oh, now you've made me cry.

1625
01:31:23.812 --> 01:31:25.104
Aw.

1626
01:31:25.105 --> 01:31:27.773
Now, what say we all go home
and hibernate?

1627
01:31:27.774 --> 01:31:30.693
Hey, Goldi, you are a chip
off the old block, you are.

1628
01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:33.195
Well, what can I say?

1629
01:31:33.196 --> 01:31:35.240
I won the orphan lottery.

1630
01:31:36.324 --> 01:31:38.075
Softpaws, Boots.

1631
01:31:38.076 --> 01:31:39.493
- Goldi.
- Bears.

1632
01:31:39.494 --> 01:31:42.579
Hey, Baby, you got any ideas
for our next job?

1633
01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.415
Oh! Remember that pie factory?

1634
01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:46.458
I suspect that
they might be experiencing

1635
01:31:46.459 --> 01:31:47.960
a leadership vacuum.

1636
01:31:47.961 --> 01:31:49.670
Oh, family business.

1637
01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:51.338
Oh, how exciting.

1638
01:31:51.339 --> 01:31:55.050
Now's a good time to talk about
ethical business practices.

1639
01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:57.845
There's a talking
cockroach on my nose!

1640
01:31:57.846 --> 01:31:59.763
- Get it off! Get off!
- Hold still.

1641
01:31:59.764 --> 01:32:01.515
Oh, no, no, wait just a second.

1642
01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.726
Ow! Hey! Hang on!

1643
01:32:03.727 --> 01:32:05.602
Hey, Perrito, about that name.

1644
01:32:05.603 --> 01:32:07.187
Let's pick one out for you.

1645
01:32:07.188 --> 01:32:09.565
Yeah. Oh, what about "Chiquito"?

1646
01:32:09.566 --> 01:32:11.191
- Hmm...
- Ah. "Chomper."

1647
01:32:11.192 --> 01:32:12.484
What do you think, Perrito?

1648
01:32:12.485 --> 01:32:13.694
"Chomper," no?

1649
01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:15.154
I got it, I got it.

1650
01:32:15.155 --> 01:32:16.989
How about "Jeff"?

1651
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:18.490
- Jeff?
- Yeah.

1652
01:32:18.491 --> 01:32:20.034
He doesn't have a Jeff's face.

1653
01:32:20.994 --> 01:32:22.703
You know,
if it's the same to you,

1654
01:32:22.704 --> 01:32:24.705
I think I'll just stick
with "Perrito."

1655
01:32:24.706 --> 01:32:26.373
I kind of like it,

1656
01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:28.250
since that's what
my friends call me.

1657
01:32:28.251 --> 01:32:31.713
Then "Perrito" it shall be.

1658
01:32:32.797 --> 01:32:34.882
You know, to be honest,
"Chomper" is pretty good.

1659
01:32:34.883 --> 01:32:36.550
Yeah, but no.

1660
01:32:36.551 --> 01:32:38.636
Well, we'll keep,
uh, workshopping it.

1661
01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:54.568
I want this vacation
to be perfect!

1662
01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:56.862
Did you remember to pack
my captain's hat?

1663
01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:58.572
Yes, Governor.

1664
01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:00.365
And your captain's shoes,
your captain's coat

1665
01:33:00.366 --> 01:33:01.742
and your captain's pajamas.

1666
01:33:01.743 --> 01:33:03.577
And what about...

1667
01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:05.579
My boat!

1668
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.749
Puss in Boots!

1669
01:33:13.588 --> 01:33:15.130
Perrito!

1670
01:33:15.131 --> 01:33:16.423
Team Friendship?

1671
01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.883
We did not agree to this.

1672
01:33:17.884 --> 01:33:20.427
Yeah, it makes us
look ridiculous.

1673
01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:21.762
Too late now. It's official.

1674
01:33:21.763 --> 01:33:23.598
Aah! Seagull! Whoa.

1675
01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:28.101
Steady as she goes, Perrito.

1676
01:33:28.102 --> 01:33:29.436
Dokey doke.

1677
01:33:29.437 --> 01:33:30.938
Where are we headed, anyways?

1678
01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:33.774
Off to find new adventures

1679
01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:37.362
