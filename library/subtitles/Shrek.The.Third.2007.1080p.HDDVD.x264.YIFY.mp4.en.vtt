WEBVTT

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.915
Onward, Ohauncey!

00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:59.649
To the highest room of
the tallest tower...

00:00:59.791 --> 00:01:04.888
where my princess awaits rescue
from her handsome Prince Oharming!

00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:20.007
This is worse than " Love Letters".
I hate dinner theater!

00:01:20.145 --> 00:01:21.908
Me, too.

00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:25.239
Whoa there, Ohauncey!

00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:30.109
Hark! The brave Prince
Oharming approacheth.

00:01:30.255 --> 00:01:34.624
Fear not, fair maiden. I shall slay
the monster that guards you...

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.695
then take my place
as rightful King.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.421
What did she say?

00:01:43.201 --> 00:01:44.600
It's Shrek!

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.531
Wooh, Shrek, yeah!

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:50.867
Prepare, foul beast...

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.673
to enter into a world of pain
with which you are not familiar!

00:01:55.814 --> 00:01:58.374
<i>Happy Birthday to thee
Happy Birthday to thee.</i>

00:01:58.517 --> 00:01:59.779
Do you mind?

00:02:00.118 --> 00:02:03.281
Do you mind? Boring!

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:10.125
Prepare, foul beast...

00:02:19.137 --> 00:02:21.833
Someday you'll be sorry.

00:02:21.973 --> 00:02:24.134
We already are!

00:02:49.267 --> 00:02:50.564
Mommy...

00:02:54.506 --> 00:02:57.998
You're right. I can't
let this happen.

00:02:58.844 --> 00:03:00.175
I can't!

00:03:01.346 --> 00:03:05.112
I am the rightful
King of Far Far Away.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.343
And I promise you
this, Mother...

00:03:07.686 --> 00:03:10.416
I will restore dignity
to my throne.

00:03:15.026 --> 00:03:16.118
And this time,

00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:20.425
no one will stand in my way.

00:03:37.382 --> 00:03:39.043
Good morning.

00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:41.712
Good morning.

00:03:43.388 --> 00:03:44.412
Morning breath.

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.719
I know. Isn't it wonderful?

00:03:48.393 --> 00:03:50.224
<i>Good morning, good morning.</i>

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:53.296
<i>The sun is shining through.</i>

00:03:53.431 --> 00:03:55.626
<i>Good morning, good
morning To you.</i>

00:03:55.767 --> 00:03:57.894
<i>And you! And you!</i>

00:04:01.806 --> 00:04:03.501
They grow up so fast.

00:04:03.642 --> 00:04:05.735
Not fast enough.

00:04:07.812 --> 00:04:10.508
You'll be filling in for
the King and Queen.

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:13.846
Several functions require
your attendance, sir.

00:04:13.985 --> 00:04:17.284
Great! Let's get started.

00:04:17.422 --> 00:04:20.255
Oome on, lazybones.
Time to get moving!

00:04:21.092 --> 00:04:23.356
You need to get a
pair ofjammies.

00:04:30.802 --> 00:04:34.033
<i>I got some sleep
and I needed it.</i>

00:04:34.172 --> 00:04:36.902
<i>Not a lot, just a little bit.</i>

00:04:37.042 --> 00:04:40.136
<i>Someone's always trying
to keep me from it.</i>

00:04:40.278 --> 00:04:43.111
<i>It's a crying shame.</i>

00:04:43.782 --> 00:04:46.148
<i>It's a royal pain in the neck</i>

00:04:46.284 --> 00:04:47.945
I knight thee.

00:05:09.808 --> 00:05:12.936
If you're filling in for a King,
you should look like one.

00:05:13.078 --> 00:05:16.138
Oan somebody come in
and work on Shrek?

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:19.473
I will see what I can do.

00:05:40.672 --> 00:05:42.333
Yeah, wow.

00:05:43.174 --> 00:05:45.665
Is this really necessary?

00:05:46.444 --> 00:05:48.105
Quite necessary, Fiona.

00:05:48.246 --> 00:05:51.044
- I'm Shrek, you twit.
- Whatever.

00:05:51.182 --> 00:05:54.879
This isn't a rehearsal, peoples.
Let's see some hustle!

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.954
Smiles, everyone! Smiles!

00:05:57.088 --> 00:06:00.546
I don't know how much
longer I can keep this up.

00:06:00.692 --> 00:06:03.627
I'm sorry, but can you just
try to grin and bear it?

00:06:03.762 --> 00:06:05.787
It's just until Dad gets better.

00:06:07.866 --> 00:06:09.197
Shrek?

00:06:10.535 --> 00:06:12.127
You look handsome.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:14.204
Oome here, you.

00:06:28.553 --> 00:06:33.217
My butt is itching up a storm and I
can't reach it in this monkey suit.

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:36.994
Hey, you! Oome here.
What's your name?

00:06:37.128 --> 00:06:39.494
Fiddlesworth, sir.

00:06:39.631 --> 00:06:40.723
Perfect.

00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:45.767
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:06:45.904 --> 00:06:49.067
Princess Fiona and Sir Shrek!

00:06:53.411 --> 00:06:55.174
Ahh! You've got it.

00:06:55.313 --> 00:06:56.837
A little to the left.

00:06:58.083 --> 00:07:00.278
That's it! That's good.

00:07:00.418 --> 00:07:03.512
Oh, yeah! Scratch that thing!
You're on it.

00:07:03.655 --> 00:07:05.088
Shrek!

00:07:09.994 --> 00:07:11.120
My eye!

00:07:11.262 --> 00:07:12.422
What are you doing?

00:07:19.003 --> 00:07:19.992
Fiona!

00:07:23.108 --> 00:07:26.339
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

00:07:29.948 --> 00:07:32.280
Shrimp! My favorite!

00:07:42.794 --> 00:07:45.490
- That's it! We're leaving!
- Oalm down.

00:07:45.630 --> 00:07:50.567
Oalm down? Who do you think we're kidding?
I am an ogre.

00:07:50.702 --> 00:07:54.297
I'm not cut out for this,
Fiona, and I never will be.

00:07:58.376 --> 00:07:59.741
I think that went well.

00:07:59.878 --> 00:08:01.106
Donkey!

00:08:01.246 --> 00:08:02.975
Oome on, Shrek!

00:08:03.481 --> 00:08:06.712
Some people just don't
understand boundaries.

00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:20.590
Just think. A couple more days
and we'll be back home...

00:08:20.732 --> 00:08:24.031
in our vermin-filled shack
strewn with fungus...

00:08:24.169 --> 00:08:27.070
and filled with the stench
of mud and neglect.

00:08:27.205 --> 00:08:29.833
You had me at "vermin-filled".

00:08:30.675 --> 00:08:35.510
And, um... maybe even the pitter-patter
of little feet on the floor.

00:08:36.014 --> 00:08:38.710
That's right, the swamp
rats will be spawning.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:40.215
Uh, no.

00:08:40.351 --> 00:08:44.048
What I'm thinking of is a
little bigger than a swamp rat.

00:08:44.189 --> 00:08:45.213
Donkey?

00:08:45.356 --> 00:08:49.019
No, Shrek. What if,
theoretically...

00:08:50.295 --> 00:08:52.422
they were little ogre feet?

00:08:58.870 --> 00:09:02.237
Honey, let's be
rational about this.

00:09:02.373 --> 00:09:04.739
Have you seen a baby lately?

00:09:04.876 --> 00:09:08.073
They just eat and
poop, and they cry...

00:09:08.213 --> 00:09:11.580
then they cry when they poop
and poop when they cry.

00:09:11.716 --> 00:09:14.514
Now, imagine an ogre baby.

00:09:14.652 --> 00:09:18.452
They extra-cry and
they extra-poop.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:22.185
Shrek, don't you ever think
about having a family?

00:09:22.327 --> 00:09:25.888
Right now, you're my family.

00:09:29.901 --> 00:09:32.062
Somebody better be dying.

00:09:34.005 --> 00:09:36.235
I'm dying.

00:09:38.576 --> 00:09:39.736
Harold?

00:09:41.913 --> 00:09:45.007
Don't forget to pay the
gardener, Lillian.

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:47.083
Of course, darling.

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.878
Fiona.

00:09:50.021 --> 00:09:51.545
Yes, Daddy?

00:09:51.689 --> 00:09:54.419
I know I made many
mistakes with you.

00:09:55.426 --> 00:09:56.893
It's okay.

00:09:57.028 --> 00:09:59.155
But your love for Shrek has...

00:10:00.098 --> 00:10:01.497
taught me much.

00:10:03.635 --> 00:10:05.626
My dear boy...

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.035
I am proud to call you my son.

00:10:09.173 --> 00:10:12.301
And I'm proud to
call you my frog...

00:10:12.443 --> 00:10:14.877
King Dad-in-law.

00:10:15.013 --> 00:10:20.610
Now there is a matter of
business to attend to.

00:10:30.962 --> 00:10:33.954
The Frog King... is dead.

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:44.108
Put your hat back on, fool.

00:10:44.242 --> 00:10:45.834
Shrek...

00:10:45.977 --> 00:10:47.638
please come hither.

00:10:51.482 --> 00:10:52.847
Yeah, Dad?

00:10:52.984 --> 00:10:56.147
This kingdom needs a new King.

00:10:57.488 --> 00:11:02.152
You and Fiona are next
in line for the throne.

00:11:03.828 --> 00:11:08.026
Next in line. You see, Dad,
that's why people love you.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:11.499
Even on your deathbed,
you're still making jokes.

00:11:15.173 --> 00:11:18.870
Oome on, Dad. An ogre as King?

00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:21.535
That's not such a good idea.

00:11:21.679 --> 00:11:24.978
There must be somebody else.
Anybody!

00:11:25.116 --> 00:11:30.315
Aside from you, there is
only one remaining heir.

00:11:30.455 --> 00:11:33.652
Really? Who is he, Dad?

00:11:33.791 --> 00:11:35.850
His name is...

00:11:37.228 --> 00:11:38.286
is...

00:11:38.429 --> 00:11:40.056
What's his name?

00:11:40.198 --> 00:11:41.790
Is...

00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:44.793
Daddy!

00:12:02.053 --> 00:12:04.021
His name is Arthur.

00:12:04.155 --> 00:12:05.554
Arthur?

00:12:09.894 --> 00:12:13.091
I know you'll do...

00:12:13.231 --> 00:12:15.893
what's right.

00:12:18.936 --> 00:12:20.267
Harold?

00:12:20.405 --> 00:12:21.963
Dad? Dad!

00:12:23.408 --> 00:12:24.636
Dad?

00:12:25.243 --> 00:12:26.835
Do your thing, man.

00:12:56.774 --> 00:13:00.642
<i>When you were young
and your heart.</i>

00:13:00.778 --> 00:13:02.939
<i>Was an open book</i>

00:13:04.949 --> 00:13:09.079
<i>y ou used to say
live and let live</i>

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.553
<i>y ou know you did, you know
you did y ou know you did.</i>

00:13:13.357 --> 00:13:18.420
<i>But if this ever changing
world In which we live in.</i>

00:13:19.297 --> 00:13:23.461
<i>Makes you give in and cry.</i>

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:28.131
<i>Say live and let die.</i>

00:13:31.576 --> 00:13:33.237
<i>Live and let die.</i>

00:14:09.747 --> 00:14:13.513
<i>Hey, lady y ou, lady.</i>

00:14:14.519 --> 00:14:16.680
<i>Cursing at your life</i>

00:14:17.355 --> 00:14:20.017
<i>y ou're a discontented mother.</i>

00:14:21.692 --> 00:14:24.354
<i>And a regimented wife.</i>

00:14:50.054 --> 00:14:53.217
What does a prince have to
do to get a drink here?

00:14:54.559 --> 00:14:56.254
Ah, Mabel!

00:14:56.394 --> 00:15:00.797
Why they call you an ugly
stepsister, I'll never know.

00:15:01.899 --> 00:15:04.993
Where's Doris? Taking
the night off?

00:15:05.136 --> 00:15:08.902
She's not welcome here,
and neither are you.

00:15:10.575 --> 00:15:12.600
What do you want, Oharming?

00:15:12.743 --> 00:15:16.804
Not much. Just a
chance at redemption.

00:15:18.416 --> 00:15:19.883
And a Fuzzy Navel.

00:15:20.017 --> 00:15:23.077
And Fuzzy Navels for
all my friends!

00:15:27.525 --> 00:15:29.152
We're not your friends.

00:15:31.362 --> 00:15:33.489
You don't belong here.

00:15:33.631 --> 00:15:37.795
You're absolutely right,
but, I mean, do any of us?

00:15:37.935 --> 00:15:39.562
Do a number on his face.

00:15:39.704 --> 00:15:44.300
Wait, wait, wait! We are
more alike than you think.

00:15:44.442 --> 00:15:48.344
Wicked Witch! The Seven Dwarfs saved
Snow White, and what happened?

00:15:48.479 --> 00:15:49.571
Oh, what's it to you?

00:15:49.714 --> 00:15:51.978
They left you the
unfairest of them all.

00:15:52.116 --> 00:15:56.644
Now here you are, hustling
pool to get your next meal.

00:15:56.787 --> 00:15:58.618
How does that feel?

00:16:04.095 --> 00:16:05.687
Pretty unfair.

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:07.229
And you!

00:16:07.365 --> 00:16:11.995
Your star puppet abandons the
show to go and find his father.

00:16:13.504 --> 00:16:15.597
I hate that little
wooden puppet.

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:17.708
And Hook.

00:16:17.842 --> 00:16:19.434
Need I say more?

00:16:23.147 --> 00:16:25.911
- And you, Frumpypigskin!
- Rumpelstiltskin.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.678
Where's that firstborn
you were promised?

00:16:31.088 --> 00:16:34.990
Mabel. Remember how you couldn't
get your little fat foot...

00:16:35.126 --> 00:16:37.026
into that tiny glass slipper?

00:16:39.697 --> 00:16:43.224
Oinderella is in Far
Far Away right now...

00:16:43.367 --> 00:16:48.395
eating bonbons, cavorting with
every last fairy tale creature...

00:16:48.539 --> 00:16:51.007
that has ever done you wrong!

00:16:51.142 --> 00:16:56.079
Once upon a time, someone decided
that we were the losers.

00:16:56.213 --> 00:16:59.080
But there are two sides
to every story...

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:01.775
and our side has not been told!

00:17:01.919 --> 00:17:06.788
So who will join me? Who wants
to come out on top for once?

00:17:06.924 --> 00:17:08.585
Who wants their...

00:17:08.726 --> 00:17:11.889
" happily ever after"?

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.741
This way, gents.

00:17:42.093 --> 00:17:47.121
<i>It's out of my hands, senorita. The
winds of fate have blown on my destiny.</i>

00:17:47.264 --> 00:17:51.064
But I will never forget you.
You are the love of my life.

00:17:51.202 --> 00:17:53.636
As are you.

00:17:53.771 --> 00:17:56.137
And, uh, you.

00:17:56.273 --> 00:17:59.436
I don't know you,
but I'd like to.

00:18:00.611 --> 00:18:01.942
I got to go!

00:18:03.347 --> 00:18:05.042
I don't wanna leave you either.

00:18:05.182 --> 00:18:08.015
But you know how Shrek is.
The dude's lost without me.

00:18:08.953 --> 00:18:12.286
But don't worry. I'll send you
airmail kisses every day!

00:18:13.624 --> 00:18:14.989
Be strong, babies.

00:18:15.126 --> 00:18:17.560
Ooco, Peanut, listen
to your mama.

00:18:17.695 --> 00:18:21.688
Bananas, no roasting marshmallows
on your sister's head.

00:18:23.701 --> 00:18:25.328
That's my special boy!

00:18:25.469 --> 00:18:28.563
Oome here, all of you!
Give your Daddy a big hug!

00:18:35.146 --> 00:18:36.477
Shrek?

00:18:37.481 --> 00:18:41.781
Maybe you should just
stay and be King.

00:18:41.919 --> 00:18:45.446
Oome on. There's no way
I could run a kingdom.

00:18:45.589 --> 00:18:48.581
That's why your cousin
Arthur is a perfect choice.

00:18:48.726 --> 00:18:51.251
It's not that. You see...

00:18:51.395 --> 00:18:55.855
And if he gives me trouble, I
always have persuasion and reason.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.333
Here's persuasion...
and here's reason.

00:19:01.739 --> 00:19:03.138
Fiona...

00:19:03.274 --> 00:19:06.539
soon it's just going
to be you, me...

00:19:06.677 --> 00:19:08.338
and our swamp.

00:19:10.181 --> 00:19:12.672
It's not going to
be just you and me.

00:19:13.951 --> 00:19:15.851
All aboard!

00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:19.854
It will be. I promise.

00:19:21.025 --> 00:19:22.515
I love you.

00:19:29.133 --> 00:19:30.794
That's lovely.

00:19:30.935 --> 00:19:32.527
Bye-bye, babies!

00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:41.304
Shrek!

00:19:42.546 --> 00:19:44.741
- Wait!
- What is it?

00:19:44.882 --> 00:19:46.372
I'm... I'm...

00:19:50.387 --> 00:19:52.252
I love you, too, honey!

00:19:52.389 --> 00:19:55.222
No! I said I'm...

00:19:58.229 --> 00:19:59.662
You're what?

00:19:59.797 --> 00:20:02.231
I said I'm pregnant!

00:20:06.403 --> 00:20:07.870
What was that?

00:20:08.005 --> 00:20:11.065
You're going to be a father!

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.707
That's great!

00:20:14.845 --> 00:20:18.110
Really? I'm glad you think so!

00:20:18.249 --> 00:20:19.648
I love you!

00:20:19.783 --> 00:20:21.774
Yeah!

00:20:21.919 --> 00:20:24.251
Me, too! You!

00:20:28.125 --> 00:20:31.617
I'm going to be an Uncle!
I'm going to be an Uncle!

00:20:31.762 --> 00:20:34.822
And you, my friend,
are royally...

00:21:13.537 --> 00:21:14.526
Home.

00:21:26.817 --> 00:21:28.148
Shrek!

00:21:30.487 --> 00:21:31.818
Fiona!

00:21:35.826 --> 00:21:37.157
Fiona?

00:21:56.380 --> 00:21:57.779
Oh, no.

00:22:00.951 --> 00:22:03.852
Better out than
in, I always say.

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:14.861
No, no, no!

00:22:17.034 --> 00:22:19.594
It's okay. It's
gonna be all right.

00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:27.036
Stop! Hey, wait!

00:23:16.427 --> 00:23:17.951
Donkey. Donkey!

00:23:18.095 --> 00:23:19.323
Wake up!

00:23:21.765 --> 00:23:23.096
Dada!

00:23:25.536 --> 00:23:27.527
Shrek! Are you okay?

00:23:29.273 --> 00:23:34.802
I can't believe I'm going to be a father.
How did this happen?

00:23:34.945 --> 00:23:39.143
Allow me to explain. When a man
has feelings for a woman...

00:23:39.283 --> 00:23:41.808
a powerful urge sweeps over him.

00:23:41.952 --> 00:23:44.443
I know how it happened.

00:23:45.289 --> 00:23:47.348
I just can't believe it.

00:23:50.127 --> 00:23:51.958
How does it happen?

00:23:58.969 --> 00:24:04.236
<i>And the cat's in the cradle
and the silver spoon.</i>

00:24:04.374 --> 00:24:07.002
<i>Little Boy Blue and
the Man in the Moon.</i>

00:24:07.144 --> 00:24:09.738
<i>When you coming home, son?
I don't know when.</i>

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.178
<i>But we'll get
together then, Dad.</i>

00:24:12.316 --> 00:24:14.307
Donkey! Oan you just
cut to the part

00:24:14.451 --> 00:24:16.976
where you're supposed
to make me feel better?

00:24:17.721 --> 00:24:20.246
You know I love Fiona, boss.
Right?

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:24.451
What I am talking about is
you, me, my cousin's boat...

00:24:24.595 --> 00:24:30.192
an ice cold pitcher of mojitos and
two weeks of nothing but fishing.

00:24:30.334 --> 00:24:32.199
Don't listen to him!

00:24:32.336 --> 00:24:35.032
Having a baby isn't going
to ruin your life.

00:24:35.172 --> 00:24:39.700
It's not my life I'm worried
about ruining, it's the kid's.

00:24:39.843 --> 00:24:44.143
When have you ever heard the
phrase "as sweet as an ogre"...

00:24:44.281 --> 00:24:46.715
or " as nurturing as an ogre"...

00:24:46.850 --> 00:24:51.219
or "You'll love my Dad.
He's a real ogre."

00:24:51.355 --> 00:24:53.118
Okay. I get it.

00:24:53.257 --> 00:24:56.715
It's not going to be easy.
But you got us to help you.

00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:58.555
That's true.

00:24:58.695 --> 00:25:00.162
I'm doomed.

00:25:00.297 --> 00:25:01.958
You'll be fine.

00:25:02.866 --> 00:25:04.766
You're finished.

00:25:07.037 --> 00:25:09.699
Uh, with yourjourney.

00:25:17.881 --> 00:25:22.318
"Wor-ces-ters-shiree"?
Now that sounds fancy!

00:25:22.452 --> 00:25:23.783
It's Worcestershire.

00:25:23.921 --> 00:25:25.752
Like the sauce?

00:25:25.889 --> 00:25:27.220
It's spicy!

00:25:31.061 --> 00:25:32.892
They must be expecting us.

00:25:38.802 --> 00:25:41.600
What in the shista-shire
kind of place is this?

00:25:41.738 --> 00:25:46.937
Well, my stomach aches and my palms just got sweaty.
Must be a high school.

00:25:47.077 --> 00:25:48.237
High school?

00:25:48.378 --> 00:25:49.936
Ready? Okay!

00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:52.514
Wherefore art thou
headed, to the top?

00:25:52.649 --> 00:25:56.608
Yeah, we think so, we think so! And dost
thou thinkest thine can be stopped?

00:25:56.753 --> 00:25:59.221
Nay, we thinkst not,
we thinkst not!

00:26:04.494 --> 00:26:08.487
All right, Mr. Percival,
ease up on the reins.

00:26:11.835 --> 00:26:15.532
For lo, bro, don't burn all
my frankincense and myrrh.

00:26:15.672 --> 00:26:19.164
I'm feeling nauseous from
memories of wedgies and swirlies!

00:26:19.309 --> 00:26:23.973
How did you receive wedgies when you are
clearly not the wearer of underpants?

00:26:24.114 --> 00:26:27.015
Let's just say some things
are better left unsaid.

00:26:27.150 --> 00:26:31.211
So I was all like, " I'd rather get the
black plague than go out with you."

00:26:31.355 --> 00:26:33.687
- Oh, totally.
- Pardon me.

00:26:33.824 --> 00:26:36.622
- Totally ew-eth.
- Yeah, totally.

00:26:38.228 --> 00:26:40.822
I just altered my character
level to +3 superb-ability.

00:26:40.964 --> 00:26:43.524
Hi. We're looking for
someone named...

00:26:43.667 --> 00:26:48.195
Who rolled a +9 dork spell and
summoned the beast and his quadruped?

00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:54.534
I know you're busy not fitting in, but
can you tell me where I can find Arthur?

00:26:54.678 --> 00:26:55.975
He's over there.

00:27:16.166 --> 00:27:20.569
There is no sweeter taste
on thy tongue than victory!

00:27:23.006 --> 00:27:25.873
Strong, handsome,
face of a leader.

00:27:26.009 --> 00:27:29.342
Does Arthur look
like a King or what?

00:27:30.514 --> 00:27:31.845
Sorry.

00:27:32.582 --> 00:27:35.210
Did you say you were
looking for Arthur?

00:27:35.352 --> 00:27:37.786
That information is on
a need-to-know basis.

00:27:37.921 --> 00:27:39.616
It's top secret!

00:27:39.756 --> 00:27:43.351
Now, gentlemen, let's away.
To the showers!

00:27:45.862 --> 00:27:47.489
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:27:47.631 --> 00:27:49.189
This is your lucky day.

00:27:50.033 --> 00:27:52.126
What are you supposed to be?

00:27:52.269 --> 00:27:55.534
Some kind of giant mutant
leprechaun or something?

00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.032
Giant mutant...
You made a funny.

00:28:00.544 --> 00:28:02.478
Unhand me, monster!

00:28:02.612 --> 00:28:04.580
Stop squirming, Arthur.

00:28:04.715 --> 00:28:07.047
I'm not Arthur.

00:28:09.052 --> 00:28:11.577
I am Lancelot.

00:28:11.722 --> 00:28:14.384
That dork over there is Arthur.

00:28:20.464 --> 00:28:22.659
This is, like, totally
embarrassing...

00:28:22.799 --> 00:28:25.393
but Tiffany thinkest
thou vex her so soothly.

00:28:25.535 --> 00:28:28.936
She thought perchance thou would
ask her to the Homecoming Dance.

00:28:29.072 --> 00:28:30.164
Excuse me?

00:28:30.307 --> 00:28:34.243
Like, whatever. She's into college
guys and mythical creatures.

00:28:37.681 --> 00:28:39.774
Oh, Arthur...

00:28:39.916 --> 00:28:43.613
come out, come out,
wherever you are!

00:28:45.655 --> 00:28:48.283
You better run, you
little punk no-goodniks!

00:28:48.425 --> 00:28:51.826
The days of Donkey Dumpy
Drawers are over!

00:28:57.934 --> 00:28:59.265
Hold it.

00:28:59.936 --> 00:29:01.995
We're here for the
mascot contest.

00:29:06.676 --> 00:29:09.873
We're here for the
mascot contest, too.

00:29:10.013 --> 00:29:12.538
This is a costume?

00:29:12.682 --> 00:29:14.673
Worked on it all night long.

00:29:16.019 --> 00:29:17.816
Looks pretty real to me.

00:29:17.954 --> 00:29:20.354
If he were real,
could I do this?

00:29:22.025 --> 00:29:23.686
Or this?

00:29:24.961 --> 00:29:29.830
If it were real, that would
have been agonizingly painful.

00:29:29.966 --> 00:29:33.163
- Now watch this!
- That's quite enough, boys.

00:29:33.303 --> 00:29:37.103
Thank you to Professor
Primbottom and his lecture...

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.639
on "just say nay".

00:29:39.576 --> 00:29:43.842
And now, without further ado, let's
give a warm Worcestershire hoozah...

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.472
to the winner of our
mascot contest, the...

00:29:48.652 --> 00:29:49.641
ogre?

00:29:51.721 --> 00:29:54.019
That's right. I'm
the new mascot.

00:29:54.157 --> 00:29:57.786
So let's really try and
beat the other guys at...

00:29:57.928 --> 00:30:01.056
whatever it is they're doing!

00:30:04.601 --> 00:30:07.593
This is all a bit unorthodox...

00:30:07.737 --> 00:30:11.400
Where can I find
Arthur Pendragon?

00:30:13.677 --> 00:30:15.167
Hey, wait...

00:30:19.282 --> 00:30:20.909
Olassic.

00:30:21.051 --> 00:30:22.746
You should be ashamed
of yourself!

00:30:22.886 --> 00:30:25.286
I didn't do it. They did.

00:30:30.093 --> 00:30:31.822
Please don't eat me.

00:30:31.962 --> 00:30:34.294
Eat him! Eat him! Eat him!

00:30:35.298 --> 00:30:37.960
I'm not here to eat him!

00:30:39.436 --> 00:30:42.064
Time to pack up your
toothbrush and jammies.

00:30:42.205 --> 00:30:44.435
You're the new King
of Far Far Away.

00:30:44.574 --> 00:30:46.235
What?

00:30:47.777 --> 00:30:51.975
Artie a King? More like
the Mayor of Loserville!

00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.709
Burn.

00:31:01.324 --> 00:31:02.450
Is this for real?

00:31:02.592 --> 00:31:06.995
Absolutely. Olean out your locker, kid.
You have a kingdom to run.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:09.792
So, wait... I'm
really the only heir?

00:31:11.134 --> 00:31:12.465
The one and only.

00:31:13.803 --> 00:31:15.464
Give me a second.

00:31:17.807 --> 00:31:19.468
My good people...

00:31:19.609 --> 00:31:22.339
there's a lesson
here for all of us.

00:31:22.479 --> 00:31:26.779
Next time you're about to dunk a kid's
head in a chamber pot, stop and think,

00:31:26.917 --> 00:31:29.408
" Hey, maybe this
guy has feelings."

00:31:30.153 --> 00:31:32.519
Maybe I should cut
him some slack.

00:31:32.656 --> 00:31:36.023
'Cause maybe... just maybe...

00:31:36.159 --> 00:31:39.856
this guy's gonna turn out to
be, I don't know, a King?

00:31:39.996 --> 00:31:45.024
"Maybe his first royal decree will be to
banish everyone who ever picked on him."

00:31:45.168 --> 00:31:48.035
I'm looking at you,
jousting team!

00:31:48.371 --> 00:31:51.568
And Guin? Oh, Guin.

00:31:52.442 --> 00:31:53.773
I've always loved you.

00:31:55.645 --> 00:31:58.205
Good friends, it breaks
my heart, but...

00:31:58.348 --> 00:32:01.840
enjoy your stay here in prison
while I rule the free world!

00:32:01.985 --> 00:32:03.577
Okay, let's not overdo it.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:07.053
I'm building my city, people...
on rock 'n ' roll!

00:32:07.190 --> 00:32:09.055
You just overdid it.

00:32:18.201 --> 00:32:19.828
Look at you!

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.494
You look darling.

00:32:21.638 --> 00:32:23.833
Just precious. Look at her.

00:32:23.974 --> 00:32:26.340
Any cravings since
you got pregnant?

00:32:26.476 --> 00:32:29.104
No. Not at all.

00:32:29.946 --> 00:32:31.675
Do you smell ham?

00:32:31.815 --> 00:32:34.943
It's present time!

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:40.881
Fiona, please open mine first.
It's the one in front.

00:32:41.024 --> 00:32:45.654
" Oongratulations on your new
mess mak..." Oh, mess maker!

00:32:45.795 --> 00:32:48.787
" Hopefully this helps.
Love, Oinderella."

00:32:50.133 --> 00:32:51.794
- Look at that!
- What is it?

00:32:53.370 --> 00:32:55.838
It's for the poopies.

00:32:55.972 --> 00:32:57.530
Wait... babies poop?

00:32:57.674 --> 00:32:59.005
Everyone poops, Beauty.

00:32:59.142 --> 00:33:00.609
Fiona!

00:33:00.744 --> 00:33:03.577
We all chipped in for a
little present, too.

00:33:04.481 --> 00:33:06.039
Ta-da!

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.083
You know the baby will
love it, because I do!

00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:13.189
Guys, that's so sweet.
Thank you.

00:33:13.323 --> 00:33:14.722
Who's this one from?

00:33:14.858 --> 00:33:17.793
I got you the biggest one,
because I love you most.

00:33:17.927 --> 00:33:20.987
" Have one on me.
Love, Snow White."

00:33:23.833 --> 00:33:25.460
What is it?

00:33:25.602 --> 00:33:27.126
He's a live-in babysitter.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.362
Where's the baby?

00:33:28.505 --> 00:33:32.566
You're too kind, Snow,
but I can't accept this.

00:33:32.709 --> 00:33:35.075
It's nothing. I have
six more at home.

00:33:35.211 --> 00:33:36.974
- What does he do?
- Oleaning.

00:33:37.113 --> 00:33:38.705
- Feeding.
- Burping.

00:33:38.848 --> 00:33:41.316
So, what are Shrek and
I supposed to do?

00:33:41.451 --> 00:33:43.578
Work on your marriage.

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:47.588
Thanks, Rapunzel. What's
that supposed to mean?

00:33:47.724 --> 00:33:51.751
Oome on now, Fiona. You
know what happens.

00:33:52.696 --> 00:33:54.721
You're tired all the time.

00:33:54.864 --> 00:33:56.593
You start letting yourself go.

00:33:56.733 --> 00:33:57.893
Stretch marks.

00:33:58.034 --> 00:33:59.365
Say goodbye to romance.

00:34:01.705 --> 00:34:05.141
I'm sorry, but how
many of you have kids?

00:34:05.275 --> 00:34:06.833
She's right!

00:34:06.976 --> 00:34:11.413
A baby will only strengthen the
love Shrek and Fiona have.

00:34:11.548 --> 00:34:14.381
How did Shrek react
when you told him?

00:34:15.552 --> 00:34:18.715
When he first found
out, Shrek said...

00:34:31.568 --> 00:34:35.902
Onward, my new friends! To
our happily ever afters!

00:34:41.578 --> 00:34:43.739
Now... bombs away!

00:35:00.263 --> 00:35:03.130
Well, well, well. If
it isn't Peter Pan.

00:35:03.266 --> 00:35:05.734
- His name's not Peter.
- Shut it, Wendy.

00:35:24.287 --> 00:35:27.950
Enough pillaging! To the castle!

00:35:46.309 --> 00:35:47.776
You go! Take care of the baby!

00:35:47.911 --> 00:35:51.074
Everybody stay calm!
We're going to die!

00:35:55.485 --> 00:35:57.612
Everyone in! Now!

00:35:57.754 --> 00:35:59.881
Oome on! Put some back into it!

00:36:03.226 --> 00:36:04.716
We don't have time. Now go!

00:36:04.861 --> 00:36:06.658
Quickly, ladies!

00:36:08.932 --> 00:36:10.490
We'll hold them off
as long as we can!

00:36:26.182 --> 00:36:28.582
Where are Shrek and Fiona?

00:36:28.718 --> 00:36:30.879
The name doesn't ring a Bell.

00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.715
No Bell.

00:36:32.856 --> 00:36:36.223
I suggest you
freaks cooperate...

00:36:36.359 --> 00:36:38.953
with the new King
of Far Far Away!

00:36:39.095 --> 00:36:42.792
The only thing you're ever gonna
be King of is King of the Stupids!

00:36:42.932 --> 00:36:45.230
- Hook!
- Right!

00:36:45.368 --> 00:36:47.598
Avast, ye cookie.

00:36:50.206 --> 00:36:51.867
Start talking.

00:36:56.246 --> 00:36:57.736
- Gingy!
- Papa!

00:36:57.881 --> 00:36:59.246
Settle down now.

00:37:13.229 --> 00:37:16.528
<i>On the good ship Lollipop.</i>

00:37:16.666 --> 00:37:20.102
<i>It's a sweet trip
to the candy shop.</i>

00:37:20.236 --> 00:37:21.225
You!

00:37:22.071 --> 00:37:24.266
You can't lie.

00:37:24.407 --> 00:37:28.070
So tell me, puppet...
where is Shrek?

00:37:31.080 --> 00:37:34.311
Well... I don't know
where he's not.

00:37:34.450 --> 00:37:36.645
You don't know where Shrek is?

00:37:36.786 --> 00:37:39.380
It wouldn't be
inaccurate to assume...

00:37:39.522 --> 00:37:43.788
that I couldn't exactly not say that is
or isn't almost partially incorrect.

00:37:43.927 --> 00:37:45.292
So you do know where he is!

00:37:45.428 --> 00:37:47.953
On the contrary, I'm
possibly more or less

00:37:48.097 --> 00:37:50.327
not definitely
rejecting the idea

00:37:50.466 --> 00:37:54.129
that in no way, with any
amount of uncertainty...

00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:55.259
Stop it!

00:37:55.405 --> 00:37:57.532
I do not know where
he shouldn't be.

00:37:57.674 --> 00:38:00.142
If that indeed wasn't
where he isn't.

00:38:00.276 --> 00:38:03.871
Even if he wasn't not where I
knew he was, it could mean...

00:38:04.013 --> 00:38:06.243
<i>On the good ship Lollipop.</i>

00:38:06.382 --> 00:38:10.785
Enough! Shrek went off to
bring back the next heir!

00:38:13.790 --> 00:38:15.587
He's bringing back
the next heir?

00:38:15.725 --> 00:38:17.215
No!

00:38:18.461 --> 00:38:21.658
Hook! Get rid of
this new " King".

00:38:21.798 --> 00:38:23.663
But bring Shrek to me.

00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:26.997
I have something special
in mind for him.

00:38:27.136 --> 00:38:29.297
He'll never fall
for your tricks!

00:38:30.974 --> 00:38:32.635
Oh, boy.

00:38:42.485 --> 00:38:45.511
I can't believe it. Me, a King?

00:38:45.655 --> 00:38:48.681
I knew I came from
royalty, but...

00:38:48.825 --> 00:38:50.918
I figured everyone
forgot about me.

00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:54.791
Oh, no. In fact the King
asked for you personally.

00:38:54.931 --> 00:38:57.491
Really? Wow.

00:38:58.835 --> 00:39:01.065
But I know it's not
all fun and games.

00:39:01.204 --> 00:39:04.196
It really is all fun
and games, actually.

00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:07.935
Sure, you have to knight a few
heroes, launch a ship or two.

00:39:08.077 --> 00:39:12.411
By the way, make sure you hit the
boat just right with the bottle.

00:39:12.548 --> 00:39:15.346
Any idiot can hit a
boat with a bottle.

00:39:16.185 --> 00:39:19.120
Well, I've heard it's
harder than it looks.

00:39:19.255 --> 00:39:21.223
This is going to be huge.

00:39:21.357 --> 00:39:26.226
Parties, princesses, castles.
Princesses.

00:39:26.362 --> 00:39:29.229
You'll be living in
the lap of luxury.

00:39:29.365 --> 00:39:31.833
The finest chefs will
wait for your order.

00:39:31.968 --> 00:39:34.937
And fortunately, you'll have
the royal food tasters.

00:39:35.071 --> 00:39:36.766
What do they do?

00:39:36.906 --> 00:39:41.502
Taste the food before the King eats,
to make sure it's not poisoned.

00:39:41.644 --> 00:39:44.238
- Poisoned?
- Or too salty.

00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:47.907
Don't worry. Your bodyguards
will keep you safe.

00:39:48.051 --> 00:39:50.315
All of them willing
at a moment's notice

00:39:50.453 --> 00:39:53.286
to lay down their lives
out of devotion to you.

00:39:53.423 --> 00:39:54.856
Really?

00:39:54.991 --> 00:39:58.017
The whole kingdom will look to
you for wisdom and guidance.

00:39:58.394 --> 00:40:00.328
Make sure they don't
die of famine!

00:40:00.463 --> 00:40:02.192
- Or plague.
- Plague is bad.

00:40:02.331 --> 00:40:05.232
The coughing, the groaning,
the festering sores.

00:40:06.803 --> 00:40:11.240
Festering sores! You are
one funny kitty cat.

00:40:11.908 --> 00:40:13.307
What did I say?

00:40:13.443 --> 00:40:15.809
We don't want Artie
getting the wrong idea.

00:40:16.579 --> 00:40:17.739
Artie?

00:40:22.018 --> 00:40:23.781
There goes my hip!

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:26.081
Artie! What are you doing?

00:40:28.024 --> 00:40:30.151
What does it look like?!

00:40:32.829 --> 00:40:35.297
This really isn't up to you.

00:40:35.431 --> 00:40:38.298
I don't know anything
about being King!

00:40:38.434 --> 00:40:40.368
You'll learn on the job!

00:40:42.271 --> 00:40:44.796
Sorry, but I'm going back.

00:40:44.941 --> 00:40:47.375
Back to what? Being a loser?

00:40:50.947 --> 00:40:52.505
Now look what you did!

00:40:53.282 --> 00:40:57.116
Look what I did? Who's
holding the wheel, chief?

00:40:58.121 --> 00:40:59.611
Shrek!

00:41:11.968 --> 00:41:13.959
Land ho!

00:41:26.482 --> 00:41:28.313
How humiliating.

00:41:29.318 --> 00:41:32.253
Oh, nice going, Your Highness.

00:41:32.388 --> 00:41:36.085
Now it's "Your Highness"?
What happened to " loser"?

00:41:36.225 --> 00:41:39.126
If you think this is getting
you out of anything, it isn't.

00:41:39.262 --> 00:41:43.028
We're heading back to Far Far
Away one way or another...

00:41:43.166 --> 00:41:45.600
and you're going to be a father!

00:41:45.735 --> 00:41:47.168
What?

00:41:48.004 --> 00:41:49.562
You just said "father".

00:41:49.705 --> 00:41:52.435
King! You're going to be King!

00:41:52.575 --> 00:41:55.567
"You're going to be
King!" Yeah, right.

00:41:56.779 --> 00:41:58.212
Where are you going?

00:41:58.347 --> 00:42:00.815
Far Far Away... from you!

00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:02.918
Get back here, young man!

00:42:04.887 --> 00:42:07.378
Boss? I don't think
he's coming back.

00:42:07.523 --> 00:42:10.720
Maybe it's for the best. He's
not exactly King material.

00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:14.091
When did you plan to tell him
you were supposed to be King?

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:17.063
Oome on. Why would I do that?

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:20.260
Besides, he'll be ten times
better at it than me.

00:42:20.403 --> 00:42:24.362
Then change your tactics if you
want to get anywhere with him.

00:42:26.709 --> 00:42:28.540
You're right, Donkey.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.404
What about this?

00:42:32.548 --> 00:42:36.382
- Shrek!
- Oome on. It's just a joke.

00:42:37.954 --> 00:42:39.285
Still...

00:42:56.072 --> 00:42:57.733
Listen, Artie.

00:42:58.307 --> 00:43:03.438
If you think this whole mad scene
ain't dope, I feel you, dude.

00:43:03.579 --> 00:43:07.709
I'm not trying to get up in
your grill or raise your roof.

00:43:07.850 --> 00:43:09.977
But what I am
screamin' is, yo...

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:13.316
check out this kazing
thazing, bazaby!

00:43:13.456 --> 00:43:15.549
If it doesn't groove,
or what I'm saying

00:43:15.691 --> 00:43:18.626
ain't straight trippin',
say, " Oh, no, you didn't!"

00:43:18.761 --> 00:43:21.195
You're getting on
my last nerve."

00:43:21.330 --> 00:43:24.322
And then I'll know it's...
I'll know it's wack!

00:43:25.935 --> 00:43:27.129
Help!

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:30.671
I've been kidnapped by a monster
who's trying to relate to me!

00:43:30.806 --> 00:43:34.435
- Artie, wait.
- Oome on! Help! Hello?

00:43:35.945 --> 00:43:39.642
Greetings, cosmic
children of the universe.

00:43:39.782 --> 00:43:41.716
Welcome to my serenity circle.

00:43:41.851 --> 00:43:45.981
Please leave any bad vibes
outside the healing vortex.

00:43:46.122 --> 00:43:47.953
Now prepare to...

00:43:53.629 --> 00:43:56.462
I knew I should have
got that warranty!

00:43:59.368 --> 00:44:00.835
Mr. Merlin?

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:02.437
You know this guy?

00:44:02.571 --> 00:44:06.837
Yeah. He was the school magic teacher,
until he had his nervous breakdown.

00:44:06.976 --> 00:44:10.343
Technically, I was merely a
victim of a level 3 fatigue.

00:44:10.479 --> 00:44:12.572
At the request of my therapist,

00:44:12.715 --> 00:44:16.344
and the school authorities, I retired
to the tranquility of nature

00:44:16.485 --> 00:44:18.646
to discover my divine purpose.

00:44:20.156 --> 00:44:23.557
Oan I interest anyone
in a snack or beverage?

00:44:23.693 --> 00:44:24.785
Uh, no.

00:44:24.927 --> 00:44:28.260
Sure you don't want to
try my Rock Au Gratin?

00:44:31.167 --> 00:44:32.634
It's organic.

00:44:32.768 --> 00:44:35.202
Thanks. I ate a Boulder
on the way in.

00:44:35.338 --> 00:44:38.273
We need directions
to Far Far Away.

00:44:38.407 --> 00:44:40.932
"We"? Who said I was
going with you?

00:44:41.077 --> 00:44:45.446
I did. People are counting on you,
so don't try to weasel out of it.

00:44:45.581 --> 00:44:47.640
If the job's so
great, you do it.

00:44:48.184 --> 00:44:52.450
Understand this, kid. No more
Mr. Nice Guy from here on out.

00:44:52.588 --> 00:44:54.886
That was your Mr. Nice Guy?

00:44:55.024 --> 00:44:56.958
Yeah, and I'm going to miss him.

00:44:57.093 --> 00:45:01.496
Why don't you go terrorize a
village and leave me alone!

00:45:01.630 --> 00:45:06.158
Was that a crack about ogres? You get
your royal highness to Far Far Away...

00:45:06.302 --> 00:45:10.329
before I kick it there! Now,
which way am I kicking?

00:45:10.473 --> 00:45:12.304
I could tell you,
but since you're

00:45:12.441 --> 00:45:14.966
in the midst of a
self-destructive rage spiral,

00:45:15.111 --> 00:45:17.636
it would be karmically
irresponsible.

00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:21.443
Self-destructive...? Are you
going to help us or not?

00:45:21.584 --> 00:45:24.178
Most definitely,
but only after you

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.517
take the journey to your soul!

00:45:27.656 --> 00:45:29.021
I don't think so.

00:45:29.158 --> 00:45:32.992
It's either that or
primal scream therapy.

00:45:35.064 --> 00:45:37.726
All right. Journey to the soul.

00:45:38.567 --> 00:45:40.432
Now, all of you,

00:45:40.569 --> 00:45:43.094
look into the Fire of Truth

00:45:43.239 --> 00:45:46.231
and tell me what you see.

00:45:49.078 --> 00:45:50.943
Ooh, charades!

00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:55.847
Okay, I see a Dutch fudge
torte with cinnamon swirls!

00:45:55.985 --> 00:45:58.579
Okay, monster... go for it.

00:46:07.263 --> 00:46:08.958
I see a rainbow pony.

00:46:09.098 --> 00:46:11.032
Excellent work! Now the boy.

00:46:11.167 --> 00:46:12.634
This is lame.

00:46:12.768 --> 00:46:15.032
You're lame! Now just go for it.

00:46:16.605 --> 00:46:17.936
Okay.

00:46:18.774 --> 00:46:23.211
There's a baby bird and a
father bird sitting in a nest.

00:46:23.345 --> 00:46:25.336
Yes! Stay with it!

00:46:26.182 --> 00:46:30.175
The Dad just flew away. Why did he
leave the little bird all alone?

00:46:30.853 --> 00:46:34.289
It's trying to fly, but
it doesn't know how to.

00:46:35.191 --> 00:46:37.352
It's going to fall!

00:46:42.198 --> 00:46:46.191
Proper head case you are.
Really messed up.

00:46:49.538 --> 00:46:54.532
Okay, I get it. The bird's me.
My Dad left. So what?

00:47:06.555 --> 00:47:09.217
Look, Artie, um...

00:47:13.562 --> 00:47:16.326
Just thought I'd
help set the mood...

00:47:16.465 --> 00:47:19.798
for your big
heart-to-heart chat.

00:47:28.244 --> 00:47:31.577
I know what it's like to not
feel ready for something.

00:47:33.916 --> 00:47:36.248
Even ogres get scared.

00:47:37.086 --> 00:47:39.919
You know... once in a while.

00:47:41.924 --> 00:47:45.690
I know you want me to
be King, but I can't.

00:47:45.828 --> 00:47:48.695
I'm not cut out for it,
and I never will be.

00:47:49.598 --> 00:47:52.089
Even my own Dad knew I
wasn't worth the trouble.

00:47:52.234 --> 00:47:55.431
He dumped me at that school
first chance he got...

00:47:56.105 --> 00:47:58.437
and I never heard
from him again.

00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:03.943
My Dad wasn't really the
fatherly type, either.

00:48:04.446 --> 00:48:06.607
I doubt he was worse than mine.

00:48:07.449 --> 00:48:08.746
Oh, yeah?

00:48:08.884 --> 00:48:12.945
My father was an ogre.
He tried to eat me.

00:48:13.789 --> 00:48:15.984
I guess I should
have realized it.

00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:20.391
He bathed me in barbecue sauce and put
me to bed with an apple in my mouth.

00:48:22.298 --> 00:48:24.789
I guess that's pretty bad.

00:48:27.136 --> 00:48:29.331
It may be hard to believe,

00:48:29.471 --> 00:48:32.929
what, with my obvious
charm and good looks,

00:48:33.075 --> 00:48:36.010
but people used to
think I was a monster.

00:48:36.145 --> 00:48:39.808
And for a long time,
I believed them.

00:48:41.817 --> 00:48:43.409
But after a while,

00:48:43.552 --> 00:48:47.079
you learn to ignore the
names people call you

00:48:47.223 --> 00:48:49.555
and just trust who you are.

00:48:51.660 --> 00:48:54.823
You know... you're okay, Shrek.

00:48:55.664 --> 00:48:59.225
You just need to do a little less
yelling and use a little more soap.

00:49:00.569 --> 00:49:02.196
Thanks, Artie.

00:49:02.338 --> 00:49:06.001
The soap's because you stink...
really bad.

00:49:07.176 --> 00:49:09.667
Yeah... I got that.

00:49:13.682 --> 00:49:16.549
This place is filthy!

00:49:16.852 --> 00:49:18.444
I feel like a hobo.

00:49:19.688 --> 00:49:22.452
I'm sorry, but this
isn't working for me.

00:49:22.591 --> 00:49:27.153
Everything's always about you. It's
not like your attitude is helping.

00:49:27.296 --> 00:49:30.993
Maybe it just bothers you I was
voted fairest in the land.

00:49:31.133 --> 00:49:33.226
You mean in that
rigged election?

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:36.338
Give me a break."
Rapunzel, Rapunzel..."

00:49:36.472 --> 00:49:39.600
let down thy golden extensions!"

00:49:39.742 --> 00:49:44.543
Ladies, let go of your petty
complaints and let's work together!

00:49:47.516 --> 00:49:50.508
So I guess the plan is
we just wander aimlessly

00:49:50.653 --> 00:49:52.746
in this stinkhole until we rot.

00:49:52.888 --> 00:49:56.415
No, we get inside and find
out what Oharming's up to.

00:49:56.558 --> 00:49:59.254
I know he's a jerk
and everything,

00:49:59.395 --> 00:50:03.559
but that Oharming makes
me hotter than July.

00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:06.231
That's it!

00:50:34.263 --> 00:50:36.629
Oome on! This way!

00:50:36.765 --> 00:50:37.754
Rapunzel, wait!

00:50:47.276 --> 00:50:49.107
Oharming, let go of her.

00:50:49.244 --> 00:50:51.872
But why would I want to do that?

00:50:57.419 --> 00:50:58.408
What?

00:50:58.554 --> 00:51:03.651
Say hello, ladies, to the
new Queen of Far Far Away.

00:51:07.663 --> 00:51:09.460
Rapunzel, how could you?

00:51:09.598 --> 00:51:11.862
Jealous much?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.434
Soon you'll be back
where you started,

00:51:14.570 --> 00:51:17.198
scrubbing floors or
locked away in towers.

00:51:17.339 --> 00:51:20.968
That is, if I let
you last the week.

00:51:23.278 --> 00:51:25.872
Pookie, you promised
not to hurt them.

00:51:26.014 --> 00:51:30.007
Not here, kitten whiskers.
Daddy will discuss it later.

00:51:30.753 --> 00:51:33.278
Now forgive us. We
have a show to put on.

00:51:33.422 --> 00:51:36.687
Shrek will be back soon,
and you'll be sorry.

00:51:36.825 --> 00:51:38.224
Sorry?!

00:51:38.360 --> 00:51:42.626
Don't you realize once Shrek
sets foot in Far Far Away...

00:51:42.765 --> 00:51:44.528
he's doomed?

00:52:24.072 --> 00:52:25.699
Look out! They got a piano!

00:52:25.841 --> 00:52:29.208
Kill them all...
except the fat one.

00:52:29.344 --> 00:52:33.713
King Oharming has something
special in mind for you, ogre.

00:52:33.849 --> 00:52:35.146
King Oharming?

00:52:35.284 --> 00:52:36.308
Attack!

00:52:42.591 --> 00:52:43.751
Artie, duck!

00:52:58.307 --> 00:52:59.569
Ready the plank!

00:53:15.290 --> 00:53:16.951
- Shrek!
- Help!

00:53:36.278 --> 00:53:37.575
Oowards!

00:53:37.713 --> 00:53:40.079
What has Oharming
done with Fiona?

00:53:40.215 --> 00:53:42.809
She's going to get
what's coming to her.

00:53:43.385 --> 00:53:48.288
And there ain't nothing
you can do to stop him!

00:53:48.423 --> 00:53:50.948
- We've got to save her.
- But she's so far far away!

00:53:51.894 --> 00:53:54.192
Get yourself back to
Worcestershire, kid.

00:53:54.329 --> 00:53:57.821
No, Shrek. Hold on.
I've got an idea.

00:53:57.966 --> 00:54:00.230
I am a buzzing bee.

00:54:00.903 --> 00:54:04.100
Mr. Merlin? They need a
spell to get them...

00:54:04.239 --> 00:54:07.265
I mean us, back to Far Far Away.

00:54:07.409 --> 00:54:10.845
Forget it. I don't have that
kind of magic in me anymore.

00:54:10.979 --> 00:54:14.676
How about a hug? That's
the best kind of magic.

00:54:14.816 --> 00:54:17.182
Please. I know you can do it.

00:54:17.319 --> 00:54:19.116
I said forget it!

00:54:19.254 --> 00:54:20.585
But...

00:54:27.996 --> 00:54:29.588
What's with you?

00:54:30.933 --> 00:54:34.096
It's just so hard, you know?

00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:38.900
They need to get back, 'cause
their kingdom's in trouble.

00:54:39.041 --> 00:54:41.566
'Cause there's a really bad man.

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:43.473
It's just so hard!

00:54:43.612 --> 00:54:45.739
Take it easy.

00:54:45.881 --> 00:54:49.248
No! I don't think
you understand!

00:54:49.384 --> 00:54:53.912
There's a mean person doing
mean things to good people.

00:54:54.056 --> 00:54:55.751
Have a heart, old man.

00:54:55.891 --> 00:55:00.055
They really need your help to get back.
Why won't you help them?!

00:55:03.899 --> 00:55:05.491
Okay.

00:55:05.634 --> 00:55:07.625
I'll go get my things.

00:55:10.405 --> 00:55:11.599
Piece of cake.

00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:15.267
Well, well. You want
eggs with that ham?

00:55:15.410 --> 00:55:19.107
I am a little rusty, so there
could be some side effects.

00:55:19.247 --> 00:55:20.714
- Side effects?
- Don't worry.

00:55:20.849 --> 00:55:24.615
Whatever it is, no matter
how excruciatingly painful,

00:55:24.753 --> 00:55:27.916
it will wear off eventually.
I think.

00:55:29.891 --> 00:55:32.121
- Oops.
- You sure about this?

00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:36.390
If Artie trusts him,
that's good enough for me.

00:55:36.531 --> 00:55:38.396
Even if his robe
doesn't cover...

00:55:38.533 --> 00:55:41.058
Alacritious expeditious...

00:55:41.203 --> 00:55:43.899
a-zoomy-zoom-zoom!

00:55:44.039 --> 00:55:46.872
Let's help our
friends get back...

00:55:49.611 --> 00:55:50.942
soon!

00:55:58.286 --> 00:55:59.878
It worked!

00:56:08.597 --> 00:56:11.623
I haven't been on a trip
like that since college!

00:56:12.067 --> 00:56:13.329
Donkey?

00:56:13.468 --> 00:56:16.301
What? Is something in my teeth?

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:23.734
Oh, no! I've been abracadabra-ed into a
Fancy Feastin', second-rate sidekick!

00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:30.142
At least you don't look like
some kind of bloated pi�ata!

00:56:30.285 --> 00:56:32.344
You should think about
going on a diet!

00:56:32.487 --> 00:56:37.083
You should get yourself a pair of pants.
I feel all exposed and nasty!

00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.092
So you two think this is funny?

00:56:43.598 --> 00:56:45.395
I'm really sorry, guys.

00:56:45.534 --> 00:56:48.002
Don't be. You got us back, kid.

00:56:53.675 --> 00:56:55.802
How in the Hans
Ohristian Andersen

00:56:55.944 --> 00:56:58.708
am I supposed to parade
around in these goofy boots?

00:56:58.847 --> 00:57:01.680
Hey, hey, hey! Be very
careful with those.

00:57:03.118 --> 00:57:06.451
They were made in
Madrid by the finest...

00:57:07.122 --> 00:57:09.113
You'll learn to control that.

00:57:12.027 --> 00:57:17.021
Seriously. Ow! You need some comfort
inserts or arch supports or something.

00:57:23.205 --> 00:57:28.074
Watch it. I'm walking here and
I'm gonna keep going until...

00:57:28.210 --> 00:57:29.302
Pinocchio!

00:57:30.045 --> 00:57:32.070
Shrek! Help me!

00:57:32.214 --> 00:57:35.411
- What happened?
- Oharming and the villains took over!

00:57:35.550 --> 00:57:39.316
Fiona and the Princesses got away.
Now she's...

00:57:39.454 --> 00:57:40.978
She's what?! What?!

00:57:43.325 --> 00:57:45.156
Puss! Loan me five bucks.

00:57:45.293 --> 00:57:47.523
You heard him. Help
the brother out.

00:57:47.662 --> 00:57:49.755
Do you see any pockets on me?

00:57:49.898 --> 00:57:51.729
Hold on a second.

00:57:54.236 --> 00:57:58.400
I had no idea, really.
I... I swear.

00:57:59.574 --> 00:58:01.769
Quick! Where is Fiona?

00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:05.676
Oharming has her locked away someplace.
You have to find him!

00:58:05.814 --> 00:58:08.681
He's probably getting
ready for the show!

00:58:08.817 --> 00:58:11.149
Wait, Pinocchio! What show?

00:58:16.158 --> 00:58:18.558
" It's a Happily Ever
After After All".

00:58:18.693 --> 00:58:21.025
" Shrek's final performance"?

00:58:21.163 --> 00:58:25.293
Shrek! You didn't tell
us you were in a play!

00:58:25.433 --> 00:58:28.891
I guess I've been so busy
I forgot to mention it.

00:58:29.037 --> 00:58:30.595
The ogre! Get him!

00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:34.272
<i>Don't worry, jefe. I got this.</i>

00:58:40.816 --> 00:58:42.443
Uck! Kill it!

00:58:43.451 --> 00:58:48.582
Look. Don't you know who he thinks he is?
How dare you!

00:58:48.723 --> 00:58:50.247
We're dealing with amateurs.

00:58:50.392 --> 00:58:55.329
He's a star, people! Hello? I'm
so sorry about this, Mr. Shrek.

00:58:55.463 --> 00:58:56.987
I'm going to lose it!

00:58:57.132 --> 00:59:00.932
Is everything ready? You did get
the list for the dressing room?

00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:04.163
Breakfast croissant stuffed
with seared sashimi tuna.

00:59:04.306 --> 00:59:07.605
And I hope you have the saffron
corn with jalape�o honey butter.

00:59:07.742 --> 00:59:10.734
Our client cannot get into
his proper emotional state

00:59:10.879 --> 00:59:12.676
withoutjalapeno honey butter!

00:59:12.814 --> 00:59:14.213
I just lost it.

00:59:14.983 --> 00:59:17.508
They should talk to Nancy
in Human Resources.

00:59:17.652 --> 00:59:21.144
Oh, we will have much to
say to Nancy, I promise!

00:59:22.824 --> 00:59:26.521
"With this sword, I do..." No.
"With..."

00:59:26.661 --> 00:59:30.324
"With this sword,
I do smote thee!"

00:59:31.233 --> 00:59:33.701
Is " smote" the right word?
" Smoot"?

00:59:33.835 --> 00:59:35.700
I don't think that's a word.

00:59:35.837 --> 00:59:40.171
Maybe I should just " smite" him.
Let's try this again. Now...

00:59:41.343 --> 00:59:44.506
Shrek attacks me. I
pretend to be afraid.

00:59:45.247 --> 00:59:49.650
" Now the kingdom will get the happily
ever after they deserve. Die, ogre!"

00:59:49.784 --> 00:59:53.447
Blah, blah, blah. Oh, it just
doesn't feel real enough!

00:59:55.357 --> 00:59:57.382
Who told you to stop dancing?!

00:59:57.525 --> 00:59:58.992
Wink and turn.

00:59:59.127 --> 01:00:02.358
What are you laying around for?
Get up! Honestly!

01:00:11.039 --> 01:00:14.236
Our happily ever after is
nearly complete, Mummy.

01:00:14.376 --> 01:00:16.571
And I assure you...

01:00:16.711 --> 01:00:21.705
the people of this kingdom will
pay dearly for every second...

01:00:22.884 --> 01:00:24.545
we've had to wait.

01:00:26.154 --> 01:00:27.587
Break a leg.

01:00:27.722 --> 01:00:30.486
On second thought, let
me break it for you.

01:00:30.625 --> 01:00:34.925
Thank goodness. I was afraid
you wouldn't get back in time.

01:00:35.063 --> 01:00:36.690
Where's Fiona?

01:00:36.831 --> 01:00:41.063
Don't worry. She and the
others are safe... for now.

01:00:50.245 --> 01:00:53.578
Let me guess. Arthur.

01:00:54.249 --> 01:00:56.274
It's Artie, actually.

01:00:56.418 --> 01:01:01.412
This boy is supposed to be the
new King of Far Far Away?

01:01:03.325 --> 01:01:04.622
How pathetic.

01:01:04.759 --> 01:01:07.626
Stand still, so I
won't make a mess.

01:01:07.762 --> 01:01:11.198
Oharming, stop! I'm here now.
You got what you wanted.

01:01:11.333 --> 01:01:12.994
This isn't about him.

01:01:13.768 --> 01:01:18.102
Then who's it about? I'm
supposed to be King, right?

01:01:19.441 --> 01:01:23.810
You weren't really next
in line for the throne.

01:01:23.945 --> 01:01:25.344
I was.

01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:28.813
But you said the King
asked for me personally.

01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:30.781
Not exactly.

01:01:30.919 --> 01:01:32.352
What does that mean?

01:01:32.487 --> 01:01:34.978
I said whatever I had
to say, all right?

01:01:35.123 --> 01:01:38.820
I wasn't right for the job, so I
needed some fool to replace me.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:42.623
And you fit the bill.
So just go!

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:47.759
You were playing
me the whole time.

01:01:47.902 --> 01:01:49.665
You catch on real fast, kid.

01:01:49.804 --> 01:01:52.898
Maybe you're not as big
of a loser as I thought.

01:01:59.314 --> 01:02:01.680
You know, for a minute...

01:02:01.816 --> 01:02:03.716
- I actually thought...
- What?

01:02:03.852 --> 01:02:07.344
That he cared about you?
He's an ogre.

01:02:07.489 --> 01:02:09.320
What did you expect?

01:02:19.300 --> 01:02:23.327
You really do have a way
with children, Shrek.

01:02:35.683 --> 01:02:39.483
<i>Leave me out with the waste.</i>

01:02:39.621 --> 01:02:42.556
<i>This is not what I do.</i>

01:02:42.690 --> 01:02:46.387
<i>It's the wrong time.</i>

01:02:46.528 --> 01:02:49.224
<i>She's pulling me through.</i>

01:02:49.364 --> 01:02:53.061
<i>It's a small crime.</i>

01:02:53.201 --> 01:02:55.829
<i>And I got no excuse.</i>

01:02:55.970 --> 01:02:58.370
<i>And is that all right, yeah?</i>

01:02:59.841 --> 01:03:01.866
<i>Is that all right with you?</i>

01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:07.044
<i>Is that all right, yeah?</i>

01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:11.542
<i>If I give my gun away
when it's loaded?</i>

01:03:13.721 --> 01:03:18.385
<i>If you don't shoot it how
am I supposed to hold it?</i>

01:03:21.563 --> 01:03:24.430
<i>Is that all right?
Is that all right?</i>

01:03:24.566 --> 01:03:28.002
<i>Is that all right with you?</i>

01:03:28.136 --> 01:03:29.001
<i>No.</i>

01:03:29.337 --> 01:03:31.168
Had we stayed put
like I suggested,

01:03:31.306 --> 01:03:34.104
we'd be sipping tea out of
little heart-shaped cups.

01:03:34.242 --> 01:03:35.766
Yeah, heart-shaped cups.

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:38.538
And eating crumpets smothered
with loganberries.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.272
Yeah, loganberries.

01:03:40.415 --> 01:03:42.280
- Shut up, Oindy.
- Yeah, shut up.

01:03:42.417 --> 01:03:45.284
- No, you shut up.
- Stay out of this.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:48.218
Who cares who's"
running the kingdom"?

01:03:48.356 --> 01:03:51.587
- I care.
- You should all care.

01:03:55.563 --> 01:03:58.464
I have your badge
number, tin can!

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.465
- Donkey?
- Princess!

01:04:00.602 --> 01:04:01.591
Puss?

01:04:01.736 --> 01:04:05.797
I am Puss, stuck here
inside this hideous body.

01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:06.964
And I'm me!

01:04:07.108 --> 01:04:08.234
But you're...

01:04:08.376 --> 01:04:11.038
Everything's fruity in the
loops, but what happened is

01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:13.147
we went to high school,
the boat crashed

01:04:13.281 --> 01:04:15.841
and we got bippity-boppity-booped
by the magic man.

01:04:15.984 --> 01:04:18.179
You poor sweet things.

01:04:18.319 --> 01:04:19.718
I don't get it.

01:04:19.854 --> 01:04:23.585
The cat turned into a little horse
that smells like feet. What's to get?

01:04:23.725 --> 01:04:25.090
Who dat?

01:04:25.226 --> 01:04:26.250
Where's Shrek?

01:04:26.394 --> 01:04:30.387
Oharming has him. He plans to kill Shrek
tonight in front of the whole kingdom!

01:04:31.799 --> 01:04:35.963
All right, everyone. We
need to find a way out now.

01:04:36.104 --> 01:04:39.631
You're right. Ladies,
assume the position!

01:04:44.512 --> 01:04:45.706
What are you doing?

01:04:46.481 --> 01:04:47.846
Waiting to be rescued.

01:04:47.982 --> 01:04:49.950
You've got to be kidding me.

01:04:50.084 --> 01:04:52.848
What else can we do?
We're just four...

01:04:52.987 --> 01:04:56.286
I mean three, super-hot
princesses...

01:04:56.424 --> 01:05:00.485
two circus freaks, a pregnant
ogre and an old lady!

01:05:01.329 --> 01:05:05.663
Excuse me. Old lady
coming through.

01:05:14.275 --> 01:05:16.072
Mom!

01:05:16.211 --> 01:05:20.477
You didn't think you got your fighting
skills from your father, did you?

01:05:20.615 --> 01:05:23.345
Excuse me. There's
still one more.

01:05:33.528 --> 01:05:35.860
Why don't you just lie down?

01:05:38.533 --> 01:05:41.400
Okay, girls, from here on out...

01:05:41.536 --> 01:05:44.004
we take care of
business ourselves.

01:06:01.055 --> 01:06:05.583
<i>The Far Far Away Theatre at the Charming
Pavilion is proud to present...</i>

01:06:05.727 --> 01:06:07.490
<i>"It's A Happily Ever
After After All."</i>

01:06:07.629 --> 01:06:10.928
Enjoy your evening of
theatrical reverie, citizen.

01:06:11.065 --> 01:06:14.398
Oi! No food or beverages
in the theater!

01:06:28.249 --> 01:06:29.614
Places, everyone!

01:06:34.756 --> 01:06:35.882
Easy!

01:06:36.024 --> 01:06:39.926
Sorry. I was showing off
for the little one.

01:06:40.662 --> 01:06:44.257
It's Bring Your Kids to Work Day.
Oome here, beautiful.

01:06:47.435 --> 01:06:50.427
Well, she's got your eye.

01:06:51.673 --> 01:06:56.610
Who would have thought a monster like me
deserved something as special as you?

01:07:38.286 --> 01:07:41.312
<i>Little birdies, take wing.</i>

01:07:42.156 --> 01:07:44.784
<i>Flitting down from the
trees they appear.</i>

01:07:44.926 --> 01:07:47.394
<i>And to chirp in my ear.</i>

01:07:48.663 --> 01:07:51.655
<i>All because I sing.</i>

01:08:21.295 --> 01:08:22.353
Move it! Go!

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:30.699
My babies!

01:08:31.706 --> 01:08:32.695
Help!

01:09:18.252 --> 01:09:20.243
Hey, how's it goin'

01:09:30.932 --> 01:09:32.866
O to the K. The coast is clear.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.628
Let's do this. Go,
Team Dynamite!

01:09:35.770 --> 01:09:39.604
I thought we agreed to use
the name Team Super Oool.

01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.970
I recall it was Team Awesome.

01:09:42.109 --> 01:09:44.043
I voted for Team
Alpha Wolf Squadron.

01:09:44.178 --> 01:09:46.146
Okay! From henceforth,

01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:50.410
we will be Team Alpha Super Awesome
Oool Dynamite Wolf Squadron.

01:09:50.551 --> 01:09:54.783
<i>Ach de liebe! There is some strange
little girl over there staring at us!</i>

01:09:55.723 --> 01:09:57.088
Artie!

01:09:57.225 --> 01:09:58.590
Wait, wait!

01:09:58.726 --> 01:10:00.921
<i>Where is the fire, se�or?</i>

01:10:01.062 --> 01:10:03.087
Please. Don't act so innocent.

01:10:03.231 --> 01:10:06.997
You both knew what was going
on and kept it to yourselves.

01:10:07.134 --> 01:10:08.726
It's not like it seems.

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:11.703
It's not? I think it
seems pretty clear.

01:10:11.839 --> 01:10:14.364
He was using me. That's all.

01:10:14.509 --> 01:10:16.943
Using you? You
really don't get it.

01:10:17.078 --> 01:10:20.070
Shrek only said those
things to protect you.

01:10:20.748 --> 01:10:25.412
Oharming was going to kill you, Artie!
Shrek saved your life.

01:10:35.997 --> 01:10:37.589
Oue the spot!

01:10:41.435 --> 01:10:43.960
<i>I wait alone up here.</i>

01:10:44.105 --> 01:10:46.801
<i>I'm trapped another day.</i>

01:10:46.941 --> 01:10:50.138
<i>Locked up here,
please set me free.</i>

01:10:50.278 --> 01:10:53.304
<i>My new life I almost see.</i>

01:10:53.447 --> 01:10:56.143
<i>A castle, you and me.</i>

01:10:56.284 --> 01:11:01.381
<i>Yes, a castle, you and me.</i>

01:11:03.457 --> 01:11:04.515
Oherubs!

01:11:08.462 --> 01:11:12.262
<i>Tis I, Tis I Upon
my regal steed.</i>

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.027
<i>Princess, my love.</i>

01:11:14.168 --> 01:11:16.932
<i>At last you shall be
freed I'm strong.</i>

01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:19.039
<i>And brave And dashing
my way there.</i>

01:11:19.473 --> 01:11:25.139
<i>With speed! With might!
With soft and bouncy hair!</i>

01:11:26.113 --> 01:11:29.879
<i>- Through the blistering desert.
- Hot!</i>

01:11:30.017 --> 01:11:33.043
<i>- Across the stormiest sea.
- Wet!</i>

01:11:33.187 --> 01:11:35.178
<i>Facing creatures so vile.</i>

01:11:35.323 --> 01:11:36.449
<i>Foul!</i>

01:11:36.591 --> 01:11:40.721
<i>So you can gaze upon me!</i>

01:11:42.029 --> 01:11:44.361
<i>I knew you'd come for me.</i>

01:11:44.498 --> 01:11:48.332
<i>And now we finally meet.</i>

01:11:48.469 --> 01:11:49.936
<i>I knew you'd wait.</i>

01:11:50.071 --> 01:11:54.599
<i>And from my plate
of love you'd eat.</i>

01:12:14.528 --> 01:12:17.861
<i>Who is this terribly ugly fiend
Who so rudely intervened?</i>

01:12:17.999 --> 01:12:19.830
<i>Will Charming fight or flee?</i>

01:12:19.967 --> 01:12:21.025
<i>Please rescue me!</i>

01:12:21.168 --> 01:12:22.863
<i>From this monstrosity!</i>

01:12:23.004 --> 01:12:28.032
<i>Fear thee not, honey lamb! I will
slice this thing up like a ham!</i>

01:12:29.210 --> 01:12:30.677
Oh, boy.

01:12:30.811 --> 01:12:34.406
<i>You are about to enter
a world of pain.</i>

01:12:34.548 --> 01:12:38.882
<i>With which you are
not familiar!</i>

01:12:42.323 --> 01:12:46.726
It can't be any more painful
than your lousy performance.

01:12:50.398 --> 01:12:52.389
" Prepare, foul beast."

01:12:54.502 --> 01:12:57.767
Prepare, foul beast,
your time is done!

01:12:57.905 --> 01:13:01.068
Oould you kill me and then sing?

01:13:02.576 --> 01:13:04.271
Be quiet!

01:13:04.412 --> 01:13:08.542
I'm just having fun with you. That's
actually a very nice leotard.

01:13:08.683 --> 01:13:09.945
Thank you.

01:13:10.084 --> 01:13:12.177
Do they come in men's sizes?

01:13:15.256 --> 01:13:16.985
Now that be funny!

01:13:17.124 --> 01:13:19.092
Enough!

01:13:21.495 --> 01:13:25.295
Now you'll finally
know what it's like...

01:13:25.433 --> 01:13:28.960
to have everything
you worked for...

01:13:29.103 --> 01:13:33.130
everything that's precious
to you, taken away.

01:13:33.274 --> 01:13:36.607
Now you'll know how I felt.

01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:45.612
Sausage roll!

01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:05.495
Pray for mercy from Puss!

01:14:05.639 --> 01:14:07.129
And Donkey!

01:14:07.341 --> 01:14:08.399
D

01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:20.682
Hi, honey.

01:14:20.821 --> 01:14:23.847
Sorry we're late. You okay?

01:14:23.991 --> 01:14:26.323
Much better, now
that you're here.

01:14:28.996 --> 01:14:34.195
So, Oharming, you want to let me out of
these so we can settle this ogre-to-man?

01:14:34.335 --> 01:14:38.669
Ooh, that sounds fun. But
I have a better idea.

01:14:54.522 --> 01:14:56.922
No! Let go of me!

01:14:57.057 --> 01:15:01.187
You will not ruin things
this time, ogre. Kill it.

01:15:05.032 --> 01:15:06.795
Everybody, stop!

01:15:08.636 --> 01:15:10.729
Oh, what is it now?!

01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:12.133
Artie?

01:15:21.816 --> 01:15:24.284
Who thinks we need to
settle things this way?

01:15:28.556 --> 01:15:32.253
You mean you want to be
villains your whole lives?

01:15:32.393 --> 01:15:36.193
But we are villains! It's
the only thing we know.

01:15:36.330 --> 01:15:38.764
You never wish you could
be something else?

01:15:38.899 --> 01:15:42.357
Easy for you to say. You're
not some evil enchanted tree.

01:15:42.503 --> 01:15:45.267
You morons! Don't listen to him!
Attack!

01:15:45.406 --> 01:15:48.204
What Steve means is it's
hard to come by honest work

01:15:48.342 --> 01:15:50.367
when the whole
world's against you.

01:15:50.511 --> 01:15:52.240
Right. Thanks, Ed.

01:15:52.379 --> 01:15:56.782
Fair enough. You're right.
I'm not a talking tree.

01:15:56.917 --> 01:15:58.009
But you know...

01:15:58.152 --> 01:16:01.280
a good friend once told me...

01:16:01.422 --> 01:16:06.450
just because people treat you
like a villain, or an ogre...

01:16:06.594 --> 01:16:08.585
or just some loser...

01:16:10.097 --> 01:16:11.997
doesn't mean you are one.

01:16:14.869 --> 01:16:18.737
What matters most is what
you think of yourself.

01:16:18.873 --> 01:16:23.173
If there's something you really
want, or someone you want to be...

01:16:23.310 --> 01:16:26.939
the only person standing
in your way is you.

01:16:27.448 --> 01:16:29.211
- Me?
- Get him!

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:30.749
No, no, no!

01:16:30.885 --> 01:16:33.820
What I mean is each of you...

01:16:33.954 --> 01:16:36.218
is standing in your own way.

01:16:40.127 --> 01:16:42.618
I always wanted to
play the flute.

01:16:42.763 --> 01:16:46.426
I'd like to open up a spa...
in France!

01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:51.129
I grow daffodils. And
they're beautiful.

01:17:39.853 --> 01:17:43.016
A new era finally begins!

01:17:44.858 --> 01:17:46.519
Now all of you...

01:17:47.361 --> 01:17:49.761
bow before your King!

01:17:56.203 --> 01:17:58.535
You need to work on your aim.

01:18:00.874 --> 01:18:03.741
This was supposed to be
my happily ever after!

01:18:03.877 --> 01:18:06.368
Well, you need to
keep looking...

01:18:08.382 --> 01:18:10.441
because I'm not giving up mine.

01:18:15.723 --> 01:18:16.883
Mommy?

01:18:28.235 --> 01:18:30.396
It's yours if you want it.

01:18:31.071 --> 01:18:33.403
But this time it's your choice.

01:18:56.096 --> 01:18:57.120
Author!

01:18:57.264 --> 01:19:00.597
Artie! Artie! Artie! Artie!

01:19:04.938 --> 01:19:07.930
Excuse me. That's my seat.

01:19:08.942 --> 01:19:13.709
<i>Okay, Se�or Hocusy-Pocusy, the time
has come to rectify some wrongs!</i>

01:19:13.847 --> 01:19:16.372
Though I have been
enjoying these cat baths.

01:19:16.517 --> 01:19:18.007
Please say you didn't.

01:19:18.152 --> 01:19:20.052
All right! Look.

01:19:20.187 --> 01:19:23.486
You'll feel a pinch and possibly
lower intestinal discomfort...

01:19:23.624 --> 01:19:25.956
but this should do the trick.

01:19:30.197 --> 01:19:32.665
- Are you...?
- I'm me again!

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:35.064
- And I am not you!
- All right!

01:19:36.637 --> 01:19:37.797
Oops.

01:19:39.807 --> 01:19:41.206
Ah, never mind.

01:19:45.212 --> 01:19:49.273
What did I tell you? The kid's
going to be a great King.

01:19:49.416 --> 01:19:52.977
Well, for what it's worth,
you would have, too.

01:19:54.488 --> 01:19:57.480
I have something much
more important in mind.

01:20:23.016 --> 01:20:24.244
Finally.

01:20:31.024 --> 01:20:32.355
Dada.

01:20:34.461 --> 01:20:38.830
<i>Was I wrong about the world?
It's a beautiful new place</i>

01:20:38.966 --> 01:20:41.457
I smell Shrek Junior!

01:20:41.602 --> 01:20:44.264
<i>Where else could
a creep like me.</i>

01:20:44.404 --> 01:20:47.134
<i>Meet such a pretty face.</i>

01:20:47.274 --> 01:20:51.210
<i>Meeting every day
with the rising sun.</i>

01:20:54.014 --> 01:20:56.915
<i>Looking up, it's looking like.</i>

01:20:57.050 --> 01:20:59.712
<i>My losing streak is done.</i>

01:21:00.621 --> 01:21:01.918
Peek-a-boo!

01:21:02.055 --> 01:21:03.386
Peek-a-boo!

01:21:06.593 --> 01:21:08.424
A bouncy, bouncy, boy!

01:21:08.562 --> 01:21:11.258
<i>Used to always feel like.</i>

01:21:11.398 --> 01:21:14.060
<i>Wished that I was
dressed better.</i>

01:21:15.068 --> 01:21:16.729
Where's the baby?

01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:21.239
<i>Never had a lot of luck
Until I finally met her.</i>

01:21:30.751 --> 01:21:34.744
<i>Meeting every day
with the rising sun.</i>

01:21:37.424 --> 01:21:39.585
<i>Looking up, it's looking like.</i>

01:21:40.260 --> 01:21:43.093
<i>My losing streak is done.</i>

01:21:45.265 --> 01:21:47.597
<i>My losing streak is done.</i>

01:21:58.445 --> 01:22:01.107
Well... what shall we do now?

01:22:17.130 --> 01:22:18.791
I got it.

01:22:25.305 --> 01:22:29.674
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Once again, come on!

01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:34.440
<i>I want to thank you for
letting me be myself.</i>

01:22:34.581 --> 01:22:35.673
<i>Again!</i>

01:22:35.816 --> 01:22:37.681
Look at my hips!

01:22:37.818 --> 01:22:43.017
<i>I want to thank you for
letting me be myself.</i>

01:22:43.156 --> 01:22:44.646
<i>Again!</i>

01:22:49.930 --> 01:22:51.454
- Break it down!
- Let's go!

01:22:51.598 --> 01:22:53.998
<i>Stiff all in the collar.</i>

01:22:55.836 --> 01:22:57.997
<i>Fluffy in the face.</i>

01:23:00.173 --> 01:23:02.664
<i>Chit chat chatter trying.</i>

01:23:04.011 --> 01:23:06.172
<i>Stuffy in the place.</i>

01:23:08.348 --> 01:23:11.181
<i>Thank you for the par-tay.</i>

01:23:12.352 --> 01:23:14.217
<i>But I could never stay</i>

01:23:14.354 --> 01:23:15.685
I'm sorry.

01:23:16.356 --> 01:23:19.348
<i>I got many things on my mind.</i>

01:23:20.694 --> 01:23:22.855
<i>But the word's in the way.</i>

01:23:23.864 --> 01:23:29.063
<i>And I want to thank you
for letting me be myself.</i>

01:23:29.202 --> 01:23:30.533
<i>Again.</i>

01:23:31.538 --> 01:23:33.506
<i>Different strokes for
different folks.</i>

01:23:33.640 --> 01:23:37.235
<i>Thank you for letting
me be myself.</i>

01:23:37.377 --> 01:23:38.867
<i>Again.</i>

01:23:41.048 --> 01:23:42.538
Break it down!

01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:46.713
Puss and Donkey, baby!
Puss and Donkey, baby!

01:23:47.220 --> 01:23:48.881
Puss and Donkey, baby!

01:23:50.223 --> 01:23:52.384
<i>Dance to the music.</i>

01:23:54.227 --> 01:23:56.559
<i>All night long.</i>

01:23:58.565 --> 01:24:00.897
<i>Everyday people.</i>

01:24:02.569 --> 01:24:04.730
<i>Sing a simple song.</i>

01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:09.231
<i>Mama's so happy.</i>

01:24:11.078 --> 01:24:13.069
<i>Mama start to cry.</i>

01:24:15.248 --> 01:24:17.739
<i>Papa's still singing.</i>

01:24:18.919 --> 01:24:22.411
<i>You can make it if
you try So try!</i>

01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:27.458
<i>Thank you for letting
me be myself.</i>

01:24:27.594 --> 01:24:28.925
<i>Again.</i>

01:24:31.932 --> 01:24:35.800
<i>Thank you for letting
me be myself.</i>

01:24:35.936 --> 01:24:37.631
<i>Again.</i>

01:24:37.771 --> 01:24:40.638
Oome on, Donkey. Do
something right!

01:24:40.774 --> 01:24:43.174
Put the hoofs together!
Put the hoofs together!

01:24:44.277 --> 01:24:48.475
Stomp your boots, baby! Stomp your boots, baby!
Stomp your boots, baby!

01:24:48.615 --> 01:24:52.483
<i>Thank you for letting
me be myself.</i>

01:24:52.619 --> 01:24:54.109
<i>Again.</i>

01:24:56.289 --> 01:25:00.817
<i>I want to thank you for
letting me be myself.</i>

01:25:00.961 --> 01:25:02.053
<i>Again.</i>

01:25:02.195 --> 01:25:05.164
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:25:05.298 --> 01:25:08.495
<i>Want to thank you
Just to be my.</i>

01:25:08.635 --> 01:25:11.502
<i>Because I just want to be my...
See?</i>

01:25:11.638 --> 01:25:14.334
<i>Can I, can I thank you! Can I.</i>

01:25:14.474 --> 01:25:16.305
Yes! Yes!
