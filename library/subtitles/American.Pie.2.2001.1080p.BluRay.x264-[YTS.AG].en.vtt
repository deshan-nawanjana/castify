1
00:00:33.744 --> 00:00:36.406
-Sure you don't wanna go tomyroom?
- No. Why?

2
00:00:36.514 --> 00:00:39.176
My room mate'sal ready moved out.
We'll be all alone.

3
00:00:39.283 --> 00:00:40.841
-All right.
- The dooris locked.

4
00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:42.782
- Okay,Jim, relax. Relax.
- Okay, yeah, sure.

5
00:00:42.887 --> 00:00:46.015
Nostrings attached, okay?
It's just friendly good-bye sex.

6
00:00:46.123 --> 00:00:48.259
Yeah, right.
Right, right, right, right.

7
00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:48.588
Yeah, right.
Right, right, right, right.

8
00:00:49.694 --> 00:00:52.219
But you see,
it'sjust that...

9
00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.230
we've never even had
friendly hello sex.

10
00:00:55.332 --> 00:00:57.232
So do you not wanna do this?

11
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.597
Oh, I do. Yeah.
No, I definitely do.

12
00:01:03.407 --> 00:01:05.272
It's just that...

13
00:01:05.376 --> 00:01:07.674
you see, this is actually
my first time.

14
00:01:07.778 --> 00:01:10.838
Well, not my first.
It's my first time...

15
00:01:10.948 --> 00:01:13.473
since my first time.

16
00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:16.746
So, technically,
that's my second time.

17
00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:19.982
And I don't--
I don't wanna suck at it.

18
00:01:20.091 --> 00:01:22.491
So if I'm not up to par,
performance-wise--

19
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.254
Jim, this isn't exactly a turn-on.

20
00:01:26.363 --> 00:01:29.025
I mean, girls like a guy
with confidence.

21
00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:31.763
Hey, I'm confident.

22
00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.999
Oh, I am-- I'm absolutely,
totally confident.

23
00:01:37.508 --> 00:01:39.237
- Let's get naked.
- Okay.

24
00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:45.874
Seems like just yesterday my dad picked
me up after my first year at college.

25
00:01:47.084 --> 00:01:49.075
We popped a couple ofbeers...

26
00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:51.518
and he said,
"Now, you're a man."

27
00:01:51.622 --> 00:01:53.954
And today I get to say
the same thing to my son.

28
00:01:54.058 --> 00:01:56.117
Honey, your speeches
embarrass him.

29
00:01:56.227 --> 00:01:59.355
So, try and do what the kids say,
andjust be cool.

30
00:01:59.463 --> 00:02:03.058
I think I bring new meaning
to the word "cool," honey.

31
00:02:03.167 --> 00:02:04.828
That's his dormitory up ahead.

32
00:02:20.684 --> 00:02:22.242
Turn over.

33
00:02:29.894 --> 00:02:32.192
- Can't bring alcohol in the dorms.
- Good.

34
00:02:32.296 --> 00:02:36.392
Thankyou, Matt. I'm just here
to surprise my sonJim.

35
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.627
- Now pin my leg up.
- What?

36
00:02:38.736 --> 00:02:41.204
Pin my leg up, like this.

37
00:02:44.608 --> 00:02:47.008
Maybe you can help
me out, you know.

38
00:02:50.514 --> 00:02:52.573
Is that the one? No.

39
00:02:52.683 --> 00:02:53.581
There!

40
00:02:57.755 --> 00:02:59.017
Now I remember.

41
00:03:01.292 --> 00:03:03.590
I didn't do this for you.

42
00:03:03.694 --> 00:03:05.252
Thanks, dude.

43
00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:09.425
- Where's my big guy?
- Oh, my God!

44
00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:16.832
-Jesus!
-Jim, we got here a little early.

45
00:03:16.941 --> 00:03:19.068
- Dad, get out!
- I'll wait in the car.

46
00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:20.643
Go, Dad!
Oh, my--

47
00:03:22.346 --> 00:03:23.973
- Geez!
- Was that your dad?

48
00:03:24.081 --> 00:03:26.276
- I'm so sorry.
- For your own edification...

49
00:03:26.383 --> 00:03:27.748
son, I'm not embarrassed.

50
00:03:27.852 --> 00:03:28.876
I am!

51
00:03:28.986 --> 00:03:31.318
It's a perfectly
normal thing for two...

52
00:03:31.422 --> 00:03:33.014
- human beings to do.
- Dad, what are you doing?

53
00:03:33.123 --> 00:03:35.182
This is human nature--
human nature at its best.

54
00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:39.456
Son, everybody does it. Your mother
and I-- Well, not so much anymore.

55
00:03:39.563 --> 00:03:41.929
Gotyour favorite.
Oh, my God! They're fucking!

56
00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:45.229
Honey, honey, listen.
I'm gonna take her--

57
00:03:45.336 --> 00:03:48.032
- Pleasejust go!
- Actually, ifyou wouldn't mind.

58
00:03:48.138 --> 00:03:50.504
Honey--
I'll take her to the car.

59
00:03:52.643 --> 00:03:54.304
- Hi, Mama.
- What?

60
00:03:54.411 --> 00:03:55.639
Natalie!

61
00:03:55.746 --> 00:03:57.145
I'm Jim's dad.

62
00:03:57.248 --> 00:03:59.239
You must be the parents
ofthis young lady.

63
00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:02.146
I'm sorry I didn't get her name,
but hopefully my son did...

64
00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:02.753
because I have not been
here the whole time.

65
00:04:02.753 --> 00:04:04.152
because I have not been
here the whole time.

66
00:04:04.255 --> 00:04:06.450
Natalie, get dressed!

67
00:04:06.557 --> 00:04:09.219
- Beer?
- Avert your eyes! Turn around!

68
00:04:09.326 --> 00:04:11.351
- Thanks,Jim. Don't believe in locks?
- Oh, my God!

69
00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.111
Hey, fuckface.

70
00:04:33.217 --> 00:04:37.051
- Mornin', dude.
- Come on, Ozzy. It's show time.

71
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:42.458
Before you go to Ann Arbor
to pick up Heather...

72
00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.459
I wanna show you
what you're missing.

73
00:04:46.263 --> 00:04:48.959
See what they are today, dude.
See what they are today.

74
00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:51.261
Okay, here we go.
Moment of truth.

75
00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:58.101
- There's little hearts on her panties!
- Super.

76
00:04:58.208 --> 00:05:01.006
There's little hearts on her panties!
Come on, look, you pussy. Look.

77
00:05:01.111 --> 00:05:03.511
What the fuck, man?
Come on!

78
00:05:03.614 --> 00:05:05.104
I'm disappointed in you.

79
00:05:05.215 --> 00:05:08.116
Here it is, the end ofour freshman year
and you screwed one girl.

80
00:05:08.218 --> 00:05:10.277
One.

81
00:05:10.387 --> 00:05:12.287
You're a disgrace
to men every where.

82
00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.358
Look at the Stifmeister.
I got laid 23 times this year...

83
00:05:15.459 --> 00:05:18.826
and I'm not counting the hummer
I got in the library stacks, baby.

84
00:05:18.929 --> 00:05:21.625
All right, here's a new idea
for you, Stifler, okay?

85
00:05:21.732 --> 00:05:23.859
You find a girl.
You two become best friends.

86
00:05:23.968 --> 00:05:26.835
You don't bother counting how many times
you have sex with each other.

87
00:05:26.937 --> 00:05:30.532
- You laugh at the people who do count.
- Here's a new idea for you.

88
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:33.041
I'll getyou a spoon
soyou can eat my ass.

89
00:05:33.143 --> 00:05:37.011
Okay, people, notebooks closed.
Let's get this exam rolling.

90
00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:41.284
Oh, shit!
Do we got an exam today?

91
00:05:41.385 --> 00:05:43.945
- Areyou kiddin' me?
- Bullshit.

92
00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:52.294
Yes! I'm never even gonna think
about political science again.

93
00:05:52.396 --> 00:05:54.387
Hey. How'd you do?

94
00:05:54.498 --> 00:05:56.591
- Fine.
- Yeah?

95
00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.397
I can't believe I'm doing the summer
abroad. Last thing I need, more classes.

96
00:06:00.504 --> 00:06:03.405
- You're gonna have a great time.
- Hello, summer!

97
00:06:04.675 --> 00:06:07.405
- Did that exam blow orwhat?
- Yeah, it sucked.

98
00:06:08.512 --> 00:06:10.377
- Kev, what's up, man? How are you?
- Good.

99
00:06:10.481 --> 00:06:12.608
Put your party hat on.

100
00:06:12.716 --> 00:06:15.150
- We got 1 2 weeks of immortality ahead.
- Yes, sir!

101
00:06:24.061 --> 00:06:25.551
Weird.

102
00:06:42.146 --> 00:06:44.944
The one that got away, huh, son?

103
00:06:52.156 --> 00:06:56.786
Well, evidently you two made quite
the hand some couple on the Internet.

104
00:06:59.797 --> 00:07:01.287
I didn't see it.

105
00:07:01.398 --> 00:07:04.856
It was brought up
at a PTA meeting.

106
00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:07.835
Anyway, my point is...

107
00:07:07.938 --> 00:07:12.375
these little sexual debacles should not
getyou down, becauseyou know what?

108
00:07:12.476 --> 00:07:14.376
It happens to the best ofus.

109
00:07:14.478 --> 00:07:16.673
In fact...

110
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.749
the first time
your mother and I...

111
00:07:19.850 --> 00:07:21.477
got together...

112
00:07:21.585 --> 00:07:22.813
I used a condom.

113
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:26.822
Well, she referred to it
as "shrinkwrapping."

114
00:07:29.359 --> 00:07:31.122
But I got over it.

115
00:07:31.228 --> 00:07:33.423
Anyway, keep your chin up.
You keep plugging...

116
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.021
and good things will happen.

117
00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:38.624
Good to have you home, son.

118
00:07:42.573 --> 00:07:45.133
It's good to be home, Dad.

119
00:07:45.309 --> 00:07:48.039
It's gonna be nice to hit Stifler's
tonight after exams.

120
00:07:48.145 --> 00:07:51.376
- Did you get through 'em?
- There's the mystery man!

121
00:07:51.482 --> 00:07:52.608
Finch, how are you?

122
00:07:59.957 --> 00:08:01.356
It' japanese

123
00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:04.689
It means "hello."
Hello.

124
00:08:04.795 --> 00:08:09.323
- Finch, what happened to Latin?
- Met a Japanese girl at the art museum.

125
00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:13.699
Changed majors. Wanted to understand
all those things she was moaning.

126
00:08:13.804 --> 00:08:16.602
- You got laid in an art museum?
- The Met.

127
00:08:16.707 --> 00:08:20.165
- And the Guggenheim with Francesca.
- The Guggenheim?

128
00:08:20.277 --> 00:08:23.269
And then my social-psych professor
in Baskin-Robbins.

129
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:24.870
All right, enough.

130
00:08:24.982 --> 00:08:28.884
But I'll tell you,
none of these women even compare to--

131
00:08:28.986 --> 00:08:30.453
Stifler's mom.

132
00:08:31.922 --> 00:08:33.981
Stifler's mom is a goddess.

133
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:41.930
How about some more of Stifmeister's
collegiate concoction?

134
00:08:42.032 --> 00:08:45.763
This thing is like half alcohol.
You'rejust trying to get me drunk.

135
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.261
Mary, would I do that?

136
00:08:49.373 --> 00:08:53.901
- My name's Christy.
- Christy, right. Beautiful name.

137
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:55.444
Like it matters.

138
00:08:55.546 --> 00:08:57.514
Hey, how you doing?

139
00:08:57.614 --> 00:08:59.741
Howdy-howdy, fuckin' partners!

140
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.284
Johnny C., how's it going?
Good to see you.

141
00:09:03.387 --> 00:09:05.480
Looks like someone
gained the freshman 1 5.

142
00:09:05.589 --> 00:09:07.580
- This'll help.
- You're an ass hole.

143
00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:08.919
Missed you too.

144
00:09:09.026 --> 00:09:12.860
All right, everybody
having a good time? Ladies.

145
00:09:14.031 --> 00:09:16.363
Fellas! How's it going?

146
00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:18.957
The keg's back there
as always. Enjoy.

147
00:09:19.069 --> 00:09:24.302
Ladies, I'm Steve Stifler
and I have an 1 1 -inch penis...

148
00:09:24.408 --> 00:09:26.535
around!

149
00:09:26.643 --> 00:09:29.874
Think about it.
Sherman!

150
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:33.040
Okay, Stifler,
takeyour shot.

151
00:09:33.150 --> 00:09:36.085
Come on, man.
I'm really happy to seeyou.

152
00:09:37.354 --> 00:09:38.685
All right.

153
00:09:38.789 --> 00:09:40.620
You stupid fuck!

154
00:09:42.059 --> 00:09:45.028
- Areyou Steve Stifler?
- Yes, I am.

155
00:09:45.128 --> 00:09:47.096
Thankyou for throwing
this awesome party, man.

156
00:09:47.197 --> 00:09:50.166
- No problem.
- The cops bust all our parties now.

157
00:09:50.267 --> 00:09:54.636
Well, I put the word out
so high school chicks would come.

158
00:09:54.738 --> 00:09:58.435
Just 'causeyou fuckers don't have dicks
doesn't make it okay for you to be here.

159
00:10:00.544 --> 00:10:03.308
- Hey, could I askyou a question?
- Sure, son.

160
00:10:03.413 --> 00:10:07.110
Is it true that Paul Finch
nailed your mom?

161
00:10:08.986 --> 00:10:10.681
Sons ofbitches.

162
00:10:11.922 --> 00:10:13.617
My mom's a saint!

163
00:10:14.558 --> 00:10:16.185
Go choke some dick!

164
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:19.329
Hey, Carlos,Jason.

165
00:10:19.429 --> 00:10:21.795
What's goin' on?
Keg's back on the deck.

166
00:10:22.899 --> 00:10:24.332
How was Iowa State?

167
00:10:24.434 --> 00:10:27.597
Did you see those fuckers
I had to boot out ofhere?

168
00:10:27.704 --> 00:10:31.401
Back at Stifler's.
Just like old times.

169
00:10:31.508 --> 00:10:32.907
One difference.

170
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.444
We're college men now.

171
00:10:35.545 --> 00:10:37.945
Some ofthese girls
are from the grade below us.

172
00:10:38.048 --> 00:10:40.141
I might actually have a chance.

173
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:42.241
Hey, I rememberyou.

174
00:10:44.721 --> 00:10:46.086
Doyou now?

175
00:10:46.189 --> 00:10:48.749
You're that guywho blew
his load on the Internet.

176
00:10:50.627 --> 00:10:53.528
Splat. "Oh, wait, Nadia,
don't go." Splat.

177
00:10:55.365 --> 00:10:57.060
- Pathetic.
- Loser.

178
00:10:57.734 --> 00:10:59.998
It's exactly like old times.

179
00:11:02.539 --> 00:11:05.201
- I'm gonna miss you.
- I'll miss you.

180
00:11:07.244 --> 00:11:09.303
I'll call you
when I get in, okay?

181
00:11:09.413 --> 00:11:10.710
Go have fun.

182
00:11:11.815 --> 00:11:13.214
Bye.

183
00:11:25.595 --> 00:11:25.696
I can't believe
those two girls, Kevin.

184
00:11:25.696 --> 00:11:27.891
I can't believe
those two girls, Kevin.

185
00:11:27.998 --> 00:11:29.898
Jim, it's not a big deal.

186
00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.400
They toyed with my emotions.

187
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.663
- Hello. Hello.
- See? There's other girls.

188
00:11:35.772 --> 00:11:39.606
- How areyou?
- You got nothing to worry about, man.

189
00:11:39.710 --> 00:11:41.678
Jessica's here.

190
00:11:42.913 --> 00:11:44.278
With Vicky.

191
00:11:44.981 --> 00:11:49.247
And Vicky got hot!

192
00:11:49.353 --> 00:11:51.913
What's that supposed to mean?

193
00:11:52.022 --> 00:11:53.250
Look at her.

194
00:11:53.357 --> 00:11:56.918
- Yeah,Jim, I see her.
- Hey, Kevin.

195
00:11:57.994 --> 00:11:59.825
I'll be right back.

196
00:12:02.566 --> 00:12:05.194
- Hey, Vic, how areyou?
- What's up?

197
00:12:05.302 --> 00:12:07.236
- I'm okay.
- Yeah, I'm good.

198
00:12:07.337 --> 00:12:08.326
That's good.

199
00:12:08.438 --> 00:12:10.633
- It's good to hear.
- Yeah, you too.

200
00:12:11.975 --> 00:12:13.533
Wow.

201
00:12:13.643 --> 00:12:16.407
Well, this is about as comfortable
as a high colonic in Tijuana.

202
00:12:16.513 --> 00:12:19.539
And I would know.
Okay.

203
00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:22.516
- I'm gonna get a drink.
- She's right.

204
00:12:22.619 --> 00:12:26.055
- Why is this so weird?
- Actually, I have no idea.

205
00:12:26.156 --> 00:12:29.523
See, I knew it.
I knewyou'd be mature about this.

206
00:12:29.626 --> 00:12:31.787
You know, and we could
still be friends, right?

207
00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:34.796
I miss you, Kev.

208
00:12:38.268 --> 00:12:39.360
Whoa.

209
00:12:41.004 --> 00:12:43.564
Friends, right?

210
00:12:43.673 --> 00:12:48.167
Yeah, right. I mean, I knowyou said
friends and I-- I just--

211
00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:51.639
I'm sorry.
I was-- It wasjust...

212
00:12:51.748 --> 00:12:54.581
an old habit--
a friend kiss.

213
00:12:54.684 --> 00:12:56.117
Areyou sure?

214
00:12:56.219 --> 00:12:58.881
Vic, whywouldn't I wanna
be friends with you?

215
00:12:58.989 --> 00:13:02.390
Look, we'll--
we'll just do this, okay?

216
00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:05.685
- Friends.
- Friends.

217
00:13:09.132 --> 00:13:11.726
- Ozzy, my man!
- There he is.

218
00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:14.804
Shake offyour chains ofmonogamy?
You're a free man.

219
00:13:14.905 --> 00:13:18.341
I don't think so, Stifler.
I'll never turn over to the dark side.

220
00:13:18.442 --> 00:13:21.775
Dumb ass. What happened to
the Nova I knew in high school?

221
00:13:21.878 --> 00:13:24.711
Nova, as in Casanova,
the guywho had all the moves.

222
00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:28.182
- He was an idiot.
- Yeah, but he was my idiot.

223
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:31.083
Hey, everyone, listen up!

224
00:13:31.188 --> 00:13:33.247
Nova's back, baby...

225
00:13:33.356 --> 00:13:36.223
and he's taken the lock
offhis cock!

226
00:13:38.061 --> 00:13:40.723
Ozzy, I'm lobbing you a softball.

227
00:13:40.831 --> 00:13:43.095
Pull outyour bat
and take a swing.

228
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.428
Mandy.

229
00:13:45.635 --> 00:13:49.833
This is my friend, Oz.
All-state lacrosse twoyears running.

230
00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:52.704
- Hi, Oz.
- Mandy, how areyou?

231
00:13:52.809 --> 00:13:55.505
Listen. I have a girlfriend.

232
00:13:55.612 --> 00:13:57.773
It was a pleasure meeting you.

233
00:13:58.548 --> 00:13:59.879
Beer out back.

234
00:14:01.952 --> 00:14:03.510
You pussy!

235
00:14:14.698 --> 00:14:16.928
Stifler's mom's room.

236
00:14:32.148 --> 00:14:34.708
How did you do
that magicyou did?

237
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:54.828
Tantra.

238
00:14:59.809 --> 00:15:01.902
What the fuck
areyou doin' in here?

239
00:15:02.078 --> 00:15:04.740
-Just relax.
- You get out ofmy house!

240
00:15:04.848 --> 00:15:07.339
-Jesus Christ!
- Come back here, you little fucker!

241
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:09.611
- Come back here, you son ofa bitch!
- Take it easy.

242
00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.018
Easy! Easy! That's enough.

243
00:15:13.123 --> 00:15:15.819
Okay, guys, we went through
this last summer, all right?

244
00:15:15.926 --> 00:15:18.190
Finch got a black eye
and Stifler got six stitches.

245
00:15:18.295 --> 00:15:19.660
'Cause he fuckin' bit me!

246
00:15:19.763 --> 00:15:21.196
You touch me, I bite.

247
00:15:21.298 --> 00:15:24.563
- You two relax and shake hands.
- Shake this.

248
00:15:28.605 --> 00:15:30.004
I need a drink.

249
00:15:30.106 --> 00:15:33.075
Why is everybody
taking a piss right now?

250
00:15:33.176 --> 00:15:36.771
-Line's too long. I ain't gonna make it.
-You'll be okay. Relax.

251
00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:40.407
Hey, bro. Hey, man, you're
the guywho boned Stifler's mom.

252
00:15:40.517 --> 00:15:43.452
- Hey, you are a god.
- Holy shit, dude.

253
00:15:43.553 --> 00:15:47.353
IfI didn't have to hold my dick 'cause
I gotta piss, I would shakeyour hand.

254
00:15:47.457 --> 00:15:49.925
- I'm honored, guys.
- Don't leave.

255
00:15:50.026 --> 00:15:52.722
You must teach me.
How?

256
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:53.693
How?

257
00:15:55.498 --> 00:15:57.591
Lookwhat I found, Christy.

258
00:15:58.735 --> 00:16:00.600
What a coincidence.

259
00:16:04.341 --> 00:16:06.176
I've been saving this
for a special occasion...

260
00:16:06.176 --> 00:16:07.473
I've been saving this
for a special occasion...

261
00:16:07.577 --> 00:16:08.178
for a special girl,
just likeyou.

262
00:16:08.178 --> 00:16:10.840
for a special girl,
just likeyou.

263
00:16:11.815 --> 00:16:14.340
- You're so sweet.
- That's what they say.

264
00:16:14.451 --> 00:16:15.850
Weird.

265
00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:19.217
- Oh, my God.
- I spilled some on you.

266
00:16:19.322 --> 00:16:21.552
- Maybe I should mop that up.
- Thanks.

267
00:16:21.658 --> 00:16:22.955
No problem.

268
00:16:23.059 --> 00:16:24.686
Whoa! Whoa, hey.

269
00:16:24.794 --> 00:16:27.922
- Take it slow. Come on.
- Right.

270
00:16:28.031 --> 00:16:31.364
You know, theywarn us
about these situations in college.

271
00:16:32.168 --> 00:16:36.434
Now, you may be intoxicated.

272
00:16:36.539 --> 00:16:38.507
Oh, yeah.

273
00:16:38.608 --> 00:16:41.338
Areyou certain thatyou wish
to engage in consenting--

274
00:16:41.444 --> 00:16:43.969
Hey, don't count
your chickens, buster.

275
00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.244
- I'm just playing by the rules, baby.
- I make the rules.

276
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:50.581
That's a pretty good fucking rule.

277
00:16:55.425 --> 00:16:58.121
Dude, the line's too long.
I'll never make it.

278
00:16:58.228 --> 00:17:00.128
- It's gotta happen now. Get my back.
- Go, bro.

279
00:17:07.671 --> 00:17:09.571
- Clamp it off.
- Hello.

280
00:17:11.007 --> 00:17:13.305
- How areyou?
- Awesome.

281
00:17:14.544 --> 00:17:16.444
- How areyou?
- I'm really good.

282
00:17:16.546 --> 00:17:20.004
How 'bout I giveyou
a little champagne?

283
00:17:20.116 --> 00:17:22.016
Go downstairs and get us some beers?

284
00:17:22.118 --> 00:17:25.383
I've got a surprise for you.
Closeyour eyes and get ready.

285
00:17:25.488 --> 00:17:27.046
I'm ready.

286
00:17:29.292 --> 00:17:31.760
- You want a beer?
- Yeah, all right.

287
00:17:36.166 --> 00:17:37.565
Okay, go.

288
00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:43.432
This is kind ofkinky,
and I like that.

289
00:17:49.045 --> 00:17:51.809
That's it.
Bathe the Stifmeister.

290
00:17:55.452 --> 00:17:57.181
Oh, that's great!

291
00:17:57.287 --> 00:17:59.448
That's great.

292
00:17:59.556 --> 00:18:01.547
How did you get it
so nice and warm?

293
00:18:05.628 --> 00:18:07.687
I can taste the bubbles.

294
00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.128
Actually, I can't.

295
00:18:17.607 --> 00:18:19.302
Much better.

296
00:18:22.312 --> 00:18:23.540
Wait a second.

297
00:18:23.646 --> 00:18:26.410
- Let's go.
- Thanks, man.

298
00:18:32.555 --> 00:18:33.123
Oh, fuck!

299
00:18:33.123 --> 00:18:35.057
Oh, fuck!

300
00:18:37.761 --> 00:18:42.198
Yep. Halfthese got
East High parking passes on them.

301
00:18:42.298 --> 00:18:45.267
Gotta break up another one.
Call in a couple ofunits.

302
00:18:45.368 --> 00:18:48.337
- Isn't this the Stifler house?
- Yeah. Ever seen Ms. Stifler?

303
00:18:48.438 --> 00:18:51.635
- What a MI LF!
- Yeah? She got all that?

304
00:18:52.976 --> 00:18:54.637
Okay, now...

305
00:18:54.744 --> 00:18:59.306
do these high schoolers thinkwe're cool
because they're at a college party...

306
00:18:59.415 --> 00:19:02.543
or are we those weird older guys...

307
00:19:02.652 --> 00:19:05.177
that try to hang out with
high school kids when we come home?

308
00:19:05.288 --> 00:19:08.416
No way. We're definitely
not those guys.

309
00:19:08.525 --> 00:19:09.890
Cops! Cops!

310
00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:13.696
Break it up.
Party's over.

311
00:19:13.897 --> 00:19:15.194
Let's go.

312
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.227
Welcome back.

313
00:19:19.335 --> 00:19:21.530
Where's Steve Stifler?

314
00:19:27.744 --> 00:19:29.644
I got peed on.

315
00:19:31.114 --> 00:19:33.947
No, man,
Stifler's got shut down.

316
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:36.883
We can't party anywhere anymore.

317
00:19:36.986 --> 00:19:39.420
And things are--

318
00:19:39.522 --> 00:19:42.821

- Yeah, alittlebit.

319
00:19:42.926 --> 00:19:45.292
First summer back from college.

00:19:45.395 --> 00:19:48.193
Yep, things are gonna get weirder.

321
00:19:48.298 --> 00:19:51.631

- Well, times change, people change.

00:20:54.998 --> 00:20:58.058
- Dad!
- He's right-- Hang on.

339
00:21:03.339 --> 00:21:06.331
- How was college?
- College was excellent.

340
00:21:06.442 --> 00:21:09.377
Yeah. Yeah, it was--
it was really excellent.

341
00:21:09.479 --> 00:21:12.107
You have not forgotten
about me, haveyou?

342
00:21:12.215 --> 00:21:15.514
No. I--
Absolutely not.

343
00:21:15.618 --> 00:21:18.917
- Idefinitely didn't.
- Good, because guess what.

344
00:21:19.022 --> 00:21:21.183
I'm coming to seeyou
at the end ofsummer.

345
00:21:21.291 --> 00:21:23.816
Ihopeyou're ready forme...

346
00:21:23.927 --> 00:21:28.523
because Ihavenotforgotten
aboutyoueither, yousexyboy.

347
00:21:28.631 --> 00:21:31.259
- Shit.
-Jim, you can eat hot dogs tomorrow.

348
00:21:31.401 --> 00:21:34.700
No, Finch,
it's not the hot dogs.

349
00:21:34.804 --> 00:21:36.704
Nadia called me this morning.

350
00:21:36.806 --> 00:21:39.969
She's coming here at the end of
the summer and she wants to see me.

351
00:21:40.076 --> 00:21:43.204
- That's killer.
- Yeah, that's a good thing.

352
00:21:43.313 --> 00:21:46.180
No, not "good thing."
Not "killer."

353
00:21:46.282 --> 00:21:48.375
I'll never be able to do it.

354
00:21:48.484 --> 00:21:52.352
Nadia is gonna be expecting
filet mignon.

355
00:21:52.455 --> 00:21:56.915
Okay, and all I'm gonna
be able to give her...

356
00:21:57.026 --> 00:21:58.584
is rump roast.

357
00:22:00.396 --> 00:22:04.730
Come on.Jim, you've had
experience since Nadia.

358
00:22:04.834 --> 00:22:06.734
Ah, yes, you would be
referring to...

359
00:22:06.836 --> 00:22:10.203
the flute-fetish band geek that made me
her bitch, then ditched me after prom.

360
00:22:10.306 --> 00:22:12.365
Yes, that's great experience.

361
00:22:12.475 --> 00:22:15.933
Youjust gotta
find the right girl,Jimbo.

362
00:22:16.045 --> 00:22:18.036
- Brings it all together.
- I had the right woman.

363
00:22:18.147 --> 00:22:22.174
Shejust sells her cottage
and takes offto parts unknown.

364
00:22:23.286 --> 00:22:25.880
My romantic life
has passed its peak.

365
00:22:25.989 --> 00:22:28.150
Take me out to the pasture
and shoot me.

366
00:22:28.257 --> 00:22:32.921
Super start to a super summer, fellas.
Welcome home.

367
00:22:34.664 --> 00:22:38.395
Guys, I got it.
Packyour bags.

368
00:22:38.501 --> 00:22:39.729
Forwhat?

369
00:22:39.836 --> 00:22:41.895
We're moving to the lake.

370
00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:48.371
We're gonna be the shit.
Everybody on the beach is gonna know us.

371
00:22:48.478 --> 00:22:51.174
Plenty ofopportunities
to practice for Nadia.

372
00:22:51.280 --> 00:22:54.477
Throw a huge party at the end
ofthe summer to cap it all off.

373
00:22:54.584 --> 00:22:58.213
Dude, that's a great idea. That way
we'll be able to welcome Heather back...

374
00:22:58.321 --> 00:23:01.313
and we'll be able to prepare
for Nadia's big arrival.

375
00:23:01.424 --> 00:23:05.053
This is it.
This is my summer oflove.

376
00:23:05.161 --> 00:23:07.322
Just thought I'd say
good-bye toyou animals.

377
00:23:07.430 --> 00:23:09.660
Hey, Mr. Levenstein.
How areyou, sir?

378
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.001
- All packed up, I see.
- We're all set, Dad.

379
00:23:14.103 --> 00:23:16.594
Don't worry, okay?
I'll be fine.

380
00:23:16.706 --> 00:23:18.640
Come on and give
your old man a hug.

381
00:23:30.386 --> 00:23:31.944
Keep it real, homies.

382
00:23:32.055 --> 00:23:34.216
You too, sir.
Have a good summer.

383
00:23:35.324 --> 00:23:37.519
All right, let's go.

384
00:23:37.627 --> 00:23:42.087
I've been running these numbers and
the four ofus can't afford this place.

385
00:23:42.198 --> 00:23:43.631
Not on summerjobs.

386
00:23:43.733 --> 00:23:45.928
Well, I kind ofthought ofthat.

387
00:23:46.102 --> 00:23:50.129
So, I invited someone else.

388
00:23:52.442 --> 00:23:56.344
Oh, yeah! The Stifmeister's
coming back to Grand Harbor!

389
00:23:56.446 --> 00:23:58.937
Deck the halls!
Bye-bye, Great Falls!

390
00:23:59.048 --> 00:24:01.278
Wipe my ass and lick my balls!

391
00:24:01.384 --> 00:24:03.614
It's Stifler time, baby!

392
00:24:17.767 --> 00:24:22.295
Stifler, ifyou're gonna be living
with us, you gotta behaveyourself.

393
00:24:22.405 --> 00:24:26.239
All right, you and Finch
just stay out ofeach other's way.

394
00:24:26.342 --> 00:24:29.072
Kevin, Stifler's stench
is unavoidable.

395
00:24:29.178 --> 00:24:31.237
Finch, fistyourself.

396
00:24:33.449 --> 00:24:35.474
That's right, baby.
We're here.

397
00:24:36.219 --> 00:24:38.278
Yeah, baby, we're here!

398
00:25:05.615 --> 00:25:08.448
- It's a palace.
- It's a temple.

399
00:25:11.387 --> 00:25:13.287
Isn't this great?

400
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:16.119
- Dude.
- Areyou kidding me?

401
00:25:32.475 --> 00:25:34.033
Thisjust won't do.

402
00:26:07.843 --> 00:26:09.242
Guys.

403
00:26:11.747 --> 00:26:14.477
Check this out.
This is it.

404
00:26:25.761 --> 00:26:28.355
Will you idiots tell me
what this fucker's doin'?

405
00:26:35.204 --> 00:26:36.865
Don't touch me
while I'm tantric.

406
00:26:36.973 --> 00:26:40.465
"Tantric?"
What the fuck is tantric?

407
00:26:40.576 --> 00:26:42.237
It's a Buddhist discipline.

408
00:26:42.345 --> 00:26:46.975
You learn to channel
your body's energies--your chakras.

409
00:26:47.083 --> 00:26:50.951
When you can do that, you can have sex
for hours, even days.

410
00:26:51.053 --> 00:26:52.543
And this stuff's for real?

411
00:26:52.655 --> 00:26:55.089
It's been around for centuries.

412
00:26:55.191 --> 00:26:57.523
With tantra you can make
an entire session ofsex...

413
00:26:57.627 --> 00:27:00.528
feel like one giant orgasm.

414
00:27:00.630 --> 00:27:04.464
Eventually, you can sustain
that feeling by meditating.

415
00:27:04.567 --> 00:27:07.798
- Maybeyou can teach me sometime?
- Very doubtful.

416
00:27:07.903 --> 00:27:10.098
- True.
- Come on,Jim.

417
00:27:10.206 --> 00:27:13.403
- You can't possibly be that bad.
- Oh, no?

418
00:27:13.509 --> 00:27:15.704
No way.

419
00:27:15.811 --> 00:27:19.577
I guess there's only one person
that really knows for sure, huh?

420
00:27:19.682 --> 00:27:22.276
Oh, yeah?
Where is she this summer?

421
00:27:36.165 --> 00:27:39.430
Hey, areyou here for
the mid-session performance?

422
00:27:39.535 --> 00:27:41.662
Guests go in the amphitheater.
You can't be here.

423
00:27:41.771 --> 00:27:43.705
Doyou know where I
could find Michelle Flaherty?

424
00:27:43.806 --> 00:27:46.798
Guests bring food.
Food attracts animals. This one time...

425
00:27:46.909 --> 00:27:49.241
a bear came, and then the bear
had to be destroyed...

426
00:27:49.345 --> 00:27:52.246
which means they shot it in the head
with a rifle and killed it and it died.

427
00:27:53.015 --> 00:27:54.915
You must know Michelle.

428
00:27:55.017 --> 00:27:57.144
One, two, three, four.

429
00:28:15.504 --> 00:28:17.301
That's a lot offlutes.

430
00:28:22.011 --> 00:28:24.070
Good luck. Thanks.

431
00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:26.842
Goodjob.
Have fun atyour next class.

432
00:28:33.055 --> 00:28:34.955
Jim. Holy potatoes!

433
00:28:35.825 --> 00:28:38.259
- You're really here?
- Everybody stick together.

434
00:28:38.361 --> 00:28:39.453
Oh, shoot!

435
00:28:39.562 --> 00:28:41.931
We're not supposed to
have visitors...

436
00:28:41.931 --> 00:28:42.295
We're not supposed to
have visitors...

437
00:28:42.398 --> 00:28:44.958
'cause this one time, here...

438
00:28:45.067 --> 00:28:45.234
this kid had these cookies--

439
00:28:45.234 --> 00:28:47.259
this kid had these cookies--

440
00:28:47.370 --> 00:28:50.134
Let me guess. A bear came.

441
00:28:50.239 --> 00:28:51.297
Cool.

442
00:28:51.407 --> 00:28:53.637
It's likeyou know
all our stories.

443
00:28:55.578 --> 00:28:57.512
Was that a question?

444
00:28:57.613 --> 00:28:59.638
I don't know. Maybe.

445
00:28:59.749 --> 00:29:01.979
Doyou wanna answer it anyway?

446
00:29:03.352 --> 00:29:07.812
I leftyou like--
like three messages after prom.

447
00:29:07.923 --> 00:29:09.220
Really?

448
00:29:09.325 --> 00:29:14.627
You didn't think I was weird because
ofthe way I acted that night?

449
00:29:14.730 --> 00:29:17.392
Weird, no.

450
00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.525
Surprising, yes.

451
00:29:19.635 --> 00:29:22.001
I get nastywhen I'm horny.

452
00:29:22.104 --> 00:29:24.572
That's kind ofwhy I'm here.

453
00:29:26.142 --> 00:29:29.578
You remember,
was I any good that night?

454
00:29:29.678 --> 00:29:32.670
Wow. Geez.

455
00:29:32.782 --> 00:29:34.511
How could I forget?

456
00:29:34.617 --> 00:29:38.485
You sucked. You didn't know
what the hell you were doing.

457
00:29:38.587 --> 00:29:42.148
But wasn't it fun even though
you were so terrible?

458
00:29:42.258 --> 00:29:45.159
- I'm sorry. "Terrible?"
- I've had worse.

459
00:29:47.863 --> 00:29:48.955
Sorry.

460
00:29:49.064 --> 00:29:52.261
I could giveyou
some pointers ifyou want.

461
00:29:52.368 --> 00:29:53.665
Really?

462
00:29:55.471 --> 00:29:59.168
Shoot. Okay, wait here.
I'll meetyou in an hour, okay?

463
00:29:59.275 --> 00:30:01.140
- Yeah.
- Wait.

464
00:30:01.243 --> 00:30:03.336
Cool idea.

465
00:30:12.555 --> 00:30:14.785
What areyou doing?

466
00:30:17.326 --> 00:30:20.454
You're all right. Here we go. You know
you're not supposed to be here now.

467
00:30:20.563 --> 00:30:24.431
Everyone's supposed to be in
the amphitheater. All right, come on.

468
00:30:24.567 --> 00:30:26.967
It's piss poor to be this late.
I'm very angry right now.

469
00:30:27.069 --> 00:30:29.970
You can tell by the tone ofmyvoice
I'm angry. I'm pissed offis what I am.

470
00:30:30.072 --> 00:30:32.302
- Here they are. Got him home.
- Go, go.

471
00:30:32.408 --> 00:30:34.376
Wait a minute.
Areyou Petey?

472
00:30:36.178 --> 00:30:37.543
Yeah, sure.

473
00:30:37.646 --> 00:30:40.080
Petey!
Well, that explains everything.

474
00:30:40.182 --> 00:30:42.776
All right. Well, always something
with these kids. Go!

475
00:30:42.885 --> 00:30:47.083
We arejust so thrilled to haveyou.
None ofmy kids are atyour caliber.

476
00:30:47.189 --> 00:30:51.216
But we arejust so overjoyed to have
someone with your kind oftalent here.

477
00:30:51.327 --> 00:30:53.420
- Great.
- Hereyou go.

478
00:30:53.529 --> 00:30:55.622
Look at this.
Your old best friend.

479
00:30:55.731 --> 00:30:57.255
- Come on. Move.
- I know it's notyours...

480
00:30:57.366 --> 00:30:59.766
butyou are going to make
beautiful music.

481
00:30:59.869 --> 00:31:01.928
- Here we go.
- This is fantastic. I'm very excited.

482
00:31:02.037 --> 00:31:05.404
Youjust own this
and break a leg.

483
00:31:23.325 --> 00:31:25.190
What was he doing
wandering unsupervised?

484
00:31:25.294 --> 00:31:26.989
Who knows?

485
00:31:27.096 --> 00:31:30.623
I'll tell you something. I'm about
fed up with these Tall Oaks North kids.

486
00:31:37.239 --> 00:31:40.208
Kids, entertain yourselves.
Play along with Petey.

487
00:31:40.309 --> 00:31:43.107
No, no, no, Petey.
Here we go.

488
00:31:43.212 --> 00:31:45.646
All right, all right.
Come on, now. A little encouragement.

489
00:31:45.748 --> 00:31:48.478
Right to this spot.

490
00:31:48.584 --> 00:31:51.212
Folks, he'sjust a little nervous.

491
00:31:52.321 --> 00:31:54.118
This isn't right.

492
00:31:54.223 --> 00:31:56.123
Just blow on it, kid.
All right.

493
00:31:56.225 --> 00:31:57.783
Here we go.

494
00:32:06.435 --> 00:32:07.800
Come on, Petey.

495
00:32:09.705 --> 00:32:11.832
Play! Do something.

496
00:32:23.018 --> 00:32:24.986
Special, my ass.

497
00:32:25.087 --> 00:32:27.351
Come on. Give the little guy
some support.

498
00:32:29.758 --> 00:32:32.727
Come on, Petey.
You're doing great, partner.

499
00:32:34.196 --> 00:32:36.289
Come on, honey.
You can do it.

500
00:32:36.398 --> 00:32:37.990
Come on, Petey.

501
00:32:40.102 --> 00:32:41.660
What the hell.

502
00:32:45.774 --> 00:32:47.264
All right!

503
00:32:47.376 --> 00:32:51.278
All right, Petey!
Come on, now! Come on!

504
00:32:52.381 --> 00:32:54.178
Rock and roll!

505
00:33:37.326 --> 00:33:38.224
Thankyou!

506
00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:43.130
Thankyou, Tall Oaks.
You're beautiful.

507
00:33:48.504 --> 00:33:50.404
My name is Petey!

508
00:33:51.507 --> 00:33:53.941
Thankyou!

509
00:33:54.743 --> 00:33:56.938
And I have gigantic balls!

510
00:34:14.697 --> 00:34:16.164
Not now!
Come back later. Go!

511
00:34:20.169 --> 00:34:22.467
Hey, hey, hey.
Come back here!

512
00:34:22.571 --> 00:34:25.802
- I wanna talk toyou!
- You are so sweet.

513
00:34:25.908 --> 00:34:28.809
He is special.

514
00:34:28.911 --> 00:34:31.345
He's my bitch.

515
00:34:33.182 --> 00:34:35.514
Well, Michelle has confirmed it.

516
00:34:35.617 --> 00:34:39.053
- I suck.
- What?

517
00:34:39.154 --> 00:34:41.918
I gotta get some practice.

518
00:34:42.024 --> 00:34:45.323
Don't worry about it. I mean,
that's whywe got the house,Jimbo.

519
00:34:45.427 --> 00:34:49.693
We plop a keg on the deck
and the girls come in offthe beach.

520
00:34:49.798 --> 00:34:52.892
It's like a hummingbird feeder.

521
00:34:53.001 --> 00:34:55.902
- You think so?
- I know so.

522
00:34:56.004 --> 00:34:57.869
Guaranteed hotties.

523
00:34:58.006 --> 00:35:00.600
Fellas, nice pad.

524
00:35:00.709 --> 00:35:03.644
Good view, but...

525
00:35:03.746 --> 00:35:07.147
the Sherminator sensors detect
no female life-forms in the vicinity.

526
00:35:07.249 --> 00:35:11.583
High likelihood of
a sausagefest in progress.

527
00:35:11.687 --> 00:35:14.019
The girls are coming.
I made some calls.

528
00:35:16.391 --> 00:35:19.622
The Sherminator's got a point, Kev.

529
00:35:19.728 --> 00:35:23.687
Since when doyou start listening
to the Sherminator?

530
00:35:23.799 --> 00:35:27.667
Since he made me realize
there's an abundance ofwiener here.

531
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:30.295
I mean, look around, dude.
Dude?

532
00:35:30.405 --> 00:35:32.566
All right,
now it's your turn.

533
00:35:32.674 --> 00:35:34.608
Come on.
There's nothing to tell.

534
00:35:35.711 --> 00:35:38.202
Hey, what's up?
What areyou guys talking about?

535
00:35:38.313 --> 00:35:40.508
Well, you know, we'rejust
trading war stories about college--

536
00:35:40.616 --> 00:35:43.016
who hooked up with who,
who slept with who--

537
00:35:43.118 --> 00:35:45.313
So, Vicky?

538
00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:49.379
Well, there was this one guy.
How 'boutyou?

539
00:35:49.491 --> 00:35:52.119
You know, there was
a few girls--

540
00:35:52.227 --> 00:35:53.194
three.

541
00:35:53.295 --> 00:35:56.128
Look atyou.
You stud.

542
00:35:57.599 --> 00:35:59.794
All right, Oz. Now that Kevin
told us, what aboutyou?

543
00:35:59.902 --> 00:36:03.338
You haven't had the slightest bit
ofattraction to any girl at school?

544
00:36:03.438 --> 00:36:06.271
Don'tyou fuckin' say no.
I knowyou did.

545
00:36:07.242 --> 00:36:09.301
Even ifI did...

546
00:36:09.411 --> 00:36:12.505
it wouldn't be anything more
thanjust a momentary thing.

547
00:36:12.614 --> 00:36:15.583
Very uninteresting.

548
00:36:15.684 --> 00:36:18.653
How aboutyou,Jessica? How many chicks
did you sleep with this year?

549
00:36:18.754 --> 00:36:20.551
Gee, wouldn'tyou like to know.

550
00:36:22.157 --> 00:36:23.590
Fuckyeah I would.

551
00:36:25.494 --> 00:36:26.791
Come on, Ozzy.

552
00:36:26.895 --> 00:36:29.295
Yeah, man. Ball.
Pool's yours.

553
00:36:29.398 --> 00:36:32.629
- Hey, Vic, you wanna play?
- Yeah, sure. You wanna break?

554
00:36:36.605 --> 00:36:38.072
What the--

555
00:36:38.173 --> 00:36:40.709
Where are the fuckin' females?

556
00:36:41.009 --> 00:36:44.713
Jim, can'tyou leaveyour shirt on?
You're scaring the chicks away.

557
00:36:44.713 --> 00:36:45.111
Jim, can'tyou leaveyour shirt on?
You're scaring the chicks away.

558
00:36:45.214 --> 00:36:47.375
Dude, give him a break.

559
00:36:49.184 --> 00:36:50.674
Ozzy, go deep.

560
00:36:50.786 --> 00:36:52.253
Yeah, bro. You playing?

561
00:36:55.824 --> 00:36:58.224
No, keep going.
Flank pattern.

562
00:36:58.327 --> 00:37:00.761
- What areyou doin'?
- Fishin'.

563
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:09.801
Areyou okay?

564
00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:15.237
- You okay?
- I'm so sorry. Is everybody okay?

565
00:37:22.384 --> 00:37:23.715
Amazing.

566
00:37:26.622 --> 00:37:28.852
The Force is strong
in that one.

567
00:37:30.192 --> 00:37:31.216
Whoa.

568
00:37:32.294 --> 00:37:36.993
The Sherminator detects serious heat
at a distance oftwo meters.

569
00:37:37.099 --> 00:37:39.033
Prepare to deploy beer.

570
00:37:42.204 --> 00:37:45.696
Dude, let me giveyou a valuable
piece ofadvice, okay?

571
00:37:45.807 --> 00:37:47.434
Drop the whole
"Sherminator" thing.

572
00:37:47.542 --> 00:37:49.635
Please repeat previous statement.

573
00:37:49.745 --> 00:37:52.578
Look, I knowyour last name
is Sherman, right?

574
00:37:52.681 --> 00:37:57.744
And that rhymes with The Terminator
which was a big hit movie ten years ago.

575
00:37:57.853 --> 00:38:00.651
Butyou can't tell me
a girl's ever really gone for it.

576
00:38:01.556 --> 00:38:04.719
System overload.
Hasta la vista, Jessica.

577
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:09.258
Freak.

578
00:38:11.566 --> 00:38:14.399
Vic, hey, you guys are leaving?

579
00:38:14.503 --> 00:38:18.234
You know, we barely had a chance
to hang out, you know, catch up.

580
00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:21.673
- What areyou doing this weekend?
- I can get together.

581
00:38:21.777 --> 00:38:24.007
- Cool. Let's hang out.
- All right.

582
00:38:24.112 --> 00:38:26.672
- Bye, Kev.
- Seeya,Jess.

583
00:38:29.918 --> 00:38:32.682
No, no, that's all wrong.

584
00:38:32.788 --> 00:38:35.916
- Thankyou. Have a nice day.
- Good-bye.

585
00:38:36.024 --> 00:38:38.959
- So what does he mean, "meet up"?
- You know, like hang out...

586
00:38:39.061 --> 00:38:40.551
grab lunch, whatever.

587
00:38:40.662 --> 00:38:44.291
I told you, we'rejust friends now.
And he totally understands.

588
00:38:44.399 --> 00:38:47.994
- I'm sure he understands quite well.
- He does.

589
00:38:48.103 --> 00:38:52.369
Oh, no, sir. These are all
wrong for you. I mean, seriously.

590
00:38:53.709 --> 00:38:55.472
Sure. Well, we're friends.

591
00:38:55.577 --> 00:38:59.035
But it's not like I see her
making plans with anyone else.

592
00:38:59.147 --> 00:39:02.742
I don't see herwith a boyfriend.
I think that puts me on deck.

593
00:39:03.919 --> 00:39:07.582
Hey, Vicky only slept with
one guy since we went out.

594
00:39:07.689 --> 00:39:12.092
I mean, that like makes me 50%
ofher entire guy-related life.

595
00:39:12.194 --> 00:39:14.128
You dipshit.

596
00:39:14.229 --> 00:39:17.392
She didn't sleep with one guy.
She slept with at least three.

597
00:39:17.499 --> 00:39:19.091
What?

598
00:39:19.201 --> 00:39:21.260
When a girl tells you
how many guys she slept with...

599
00:39:21.370 --> 00:39:23.361
multiply it by three
and that's the real number.

600
00:39:23.472 --> 00:39:26.441
Didn'tyou fuckers
learn anything at college?

601
00:39:29.177 --> 00:39:32.237
He did not sleep with three girls,
much like Sly and the Family Stone...

602
00:39:32.347 --> 00:39:34.713
aren't gonna dance in here
and gang-bang me...

603
00:39:34.816 --> 00:39:37.307
between the afros
and the bell-bottoms.

604
00:39:37.419 --> 00:39:38.784
It's not gonna happen.

605
00:39:38.887 --> 00:39:42.721
- Kevin did not sleep with three girls.
- Whywould he lie to me?

606
00:39:42.824 --> 00:39:43.058
It's not a lie. It's an adjustment.
The rule ofthree.

607
00:39:43.058 --> 00:39:46.027
It's not a lie. It's an adjustment.
The rule ofthree.

608
00:39:46.128 --> 00:39:47.823
- The rule ofwhat?
- Three.

609
00:39:47.929 --> 00:39:51.490
A guy tells you how many girls he's
been with, it's not even close to that.

610
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:54.831
Take that number and divide it by three.
Then you get the real total.

611
00:39:54.936 --> 00:39:58.895
So, if Kevin's saying it's been three
girls, it's more like one, or none.

612
00:39:59.007 --> 00:40:01.532
- None?
- Rule ofthree.

613
00:40:01.643 --> 00:40:04.246
It's an exact science,
consistent as gravity.

614
00:40:05.447 --> 00:40:07.347
Ozzy, I'm happy for you.

615
00:40:07.449 --> 00:40:10.043
At leastyou've seen a nice bod
while Heather's offsuckin' dick.

616
00:40:10.152 --> 00:40:12.120
Keepyour fantasies toyourself.

617
00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.620
Dude, useyour fuckin' brain.

618
00:40:14.723 --> 00:40:18.159
"I'm the American college chick.
La, la, la.

619
00:40:18.260 --> 00:40:20.694
Your European cultural shit
is so charming.

620
00:40:21.530 --> 00:40:24.465
Hot Spanish guy.
Loveyour accent.

621
00:40:24.566 --> 00:40:26.466
Loveyour ding-dong."

622
00:40:26.568 --> 00:40:30.527
I'm tellin' you, right now there
is a dick in your girlfriend's mouth.

623
00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:33.767
- Knock it off.
- What'd I say?

624
00:40:52.761 --> 00:40:54.285
Oh, my God!

625
00:40:57.232 --> 00:41:00.292
Guys, check it out.
Lesbians.

626
00:41:02.270 --> 00:41:04.005
Lesbians live here.

627
00:41:04.172 --> 00:41:06.663
You know,
Mr. Homophobic Wizard...

628
00:41:06.775 --> 00:41:10.939
that it is possible forwomen
to hold hands and not be gay.

629
00:41:11.046 --> 00:41:12.570
Friends can hold hands.

630
00:41:12.681 --> 00:41:16.913
Hey, Finch, I don't wanna hear aboutyou
and your boyfriends. Gojerk off.

631
00:41:17.018 --> 00:41:19.077
Unnecessary.

632
00:41:19.187 --> 00:41:21.655
Tantra teaches you to hold
an orgasm over time...

633
00:41:21.756 --> 00:41:24.190
in anticipation
ofan ultimate moment...

634
00:41:24.292 --> 00:41:26.692
to release it upon the world.

635
00:41:26.795 --> 00:41:29.025
I'm filling up to the brim.

636
00:41:29.131 --> 00:41:33.535
That's fucking disgusting!
I'm gonna throw up.

637
00:41:41.143 --> 00:41:42.872
Hey, Heather. You're in!

638
00:41:44.279 --> 00:41:45.769
How's the studying going?

639
00:41:45.881 --> 00:41:47.849
I'd hardly call it studying.

640
00:41:47.949 --> 00:41:52.318
I've been going to the Picasso Museum,
hanging out at Sagrada Familia...

641
00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.820
going with Pierre
to the Parc Guell.

642
00:41:54.923 --> 00:41:57.391
- Who's Pierre?
- One ofthe guys in the program.

643
00:41:57.492 --> 00:42:00.290
He's got a girlfriend back in France, so
we've kind ofgot something in common.

644
00:42:00.395 --> 00:42:02.056
That sounds cool.

645
00:42:02.164 --> 00:42:06.396
Yeah, I've overheard them
on the phone at night.

646
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:10.232
And, well, it made me think.

647
00:42:10.338 --> 00:42:14.172
Hey, Oz, I'm reaching undermyshirt
andI'm rubbing myself.

648
00:42:15.977 --> 00:42:19.242
Oz, come on. It's phone sex.
Help me out here.

649
00:42:19.347 --> 00:42:20.780
Okay.

650
00:42:23.718 --> 00:42:26.653
I'm going over to my bed.

651
00:42:27.789 --> 00:42:30.087
AndI'm lying down.

652
00:42:30.192 --> 00:42:32.626
And I'm slowly...

653
00:42:32.727 --> 00:42:36.094
reaching downstairs.

654
00:42:36.198 --> 00:42:37.927
Grab it.
Tell me how big it is.

655
00:42:39.334 --> 00:42:42.497
Listen, Heather,
I'm feeling kind ofawkward.

656
00:42:42.604 --> 00:42:46.335
Ifwe can't be with each other,
then we have to learn to be more vocal.

657
00:42:46.441 --> 00:42:48.841
- Right?
- Right. Okay.

658
00:42:48.944 --> 00:42:53.608
Okay, here we go.
I'm reaching in my pants now.

659
00:42:53.715 --> 00:42:55.410
And I'm rubbing it
for you, Heather.

660
00:42:55.517 --> 00:42:58.281
And it feels so good.

661
00:42:58.386 --> 00:43:00.650
- Yeah, me too.
- Oh, yeah.

662
00:43:00.755 --> 00:43:02.586
I got--

663
00:43:02.691 --> 00:43:03.851
Call waiting.

664
00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.655
Oh, shit. Hello?

665
00:43:08.997 --> 00:43:10.396
Wrong number.

666
00:43:11.566 --> 00:43:13.466
Hey. Hello. Wrong number.

667
00:43:15.870 --> 00:43:19.033
All right, look, man. I got
my hand on my dick right now, okay...

668
00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.608
and I'm trying to have sex
with my girlfriend over the phone.

669
00:43:22.711 --> 00:43:24.611
Goodfor you, man.

670
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:31.675
Sorry about that.
Where were we?

671
00:43:31.786 --> 00:43:34.118
I thinkyou were
reaching for something.

672
00:43:34.222 --> 00:43:36.281
Oh, yeah.

673
00:43:36.391 --> 00:43:41.328

I know.

742
00:48:25.346 --> 00:48:28.042
Guys, we got nothin'
to worry about.

743
00:48:28.149 --> 00:48:31.050
I just remembered, I got that dildo
from the other bedroom.

744
00:48:34.889 --> 00:48:37.790
Holy shit!
There's a dildo in my drawer.

745
00:48:37.892 --> 00:48:41.521
Oh, my God! You could have
asked me ifyou wanted to borrow it.

746
00:48:42.730 --> 00:48:44.254
Stop it.

747
00:48:46.668 --> 00:48:49.831
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know. Call 91 1 .

748
00:48:53.541 --> 00:48:55.099

749
00:48:55.209 --> 00:48:59.043
- My God, it's the painting kids.
- I'm still calling the cops.

750
00:48:59.147 --> 00:49:01.115
Okay, no, no, no.
This isn't right.

751
00:49:01.215 --> 00:49:04.446
- Look. Stifler did break in here.
- You dick!

752
00:49:04.552 --> 00:49:07.077
But wejust followed him in

753
00:49:08.756 --> 00:49:11.384
I just wanted proofthatyou chicks

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:19.099
You wanna mess with 'em?

Ozzy, stand by for confirmation.

That's a big 1 0-4

00:49:43.825 --> 00:49:46.851
Sounds likeyour little friends
outside wanna play too.

761
00:49:50.331 --> 00:49:52.231
You won't be needing this.

762
00:49:54.102 --> 00:49:56.002
Who wants me to touch Amber?

763
00:49:57.271 --> 00:49:58.761

That's too much.
No, no, no.

782
00:51:02.170 --> 00:51:04.195
You don't touch,

Come on.

00:53:09.630 --> 00:53:12.190
That is what I'm talking about.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.133
Kev, you can look.

824
00:53:19.173 --> 00:53:21.038
That's it.

825
00:53:21.142 --> 00:53:22.871
Where's your tongue?

826
00:53:28.549 --> 00:53:30.039
Good boys.

827
00:53:30.151 --> 00:53:32.915
- Very good.
- Dude, you're a fucking lousy kisser.

828
00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:34.954
What? I wasn't trying!

829
00:53:35.056 --> 00:53:36.921
That's not fair!

830
00:53:37.024 --> 00:53:38.992
I wasn't trying there.
I'm really--

831
00:53:39.093 --> 00:53:40.788

- Here we go.
- Let's do it.

839
00:54:13.628 --> 00:54:17.086

840
00:54:17.198 --> 00:54:19.689
- Honey, come on. Food's ready.
- I'm not hungry!

841
00:54:29.443 --> 00:54:32.003
I can't believe this.
Okay,just do it.

00:54:58.639 --> 00:55:02.040
- I want more.
- Hell, yeah. I want more too, baby.

847
00:55:03.945 --> 00:55:08.075
We're gonna get more physical
as soon as we get some--

848
00:55:09.617 --> 00:55:11.983
- Handjobs.
- Okay!

849
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:15.218
Handjobs.

850
00:55:17.158 --> 00:55:20.423
You do him.
We love to watch.

851
00:55:21.696 --> 00:55:22.754
I'm sorry?

852
00:55:22.863 --> 00:55:25.024
- You go.
- We go.

853
00:55:29.837 --> 00:55:31.737
Don't be a wimp.

854
00:55:35.076 --> 00:55:37.510
Okay. It's okay.

855
00:55:37.611 --> 00:55:39.442
I know what I have to do.

856
00:55:40.281 --> 00:55:42.613
I need to keep this party goin'.

857
00:55:43.718 --> 00:55:46.187
I'm takin' one for the team.

858
00:55:47.088 --> 00:55:48.487
Mother ofGod!

859
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:50.113
Come on, you pussies!
We had 'em!

860
00:55:50.224 --> 00:55:52.886
- I am not touching that.
- Put that thing away, Stifler.

861
00:55:52.994 --> 00:55:56.225
Why can'tyou guys
be team players, huh?

862
00:55:56.330 --> 00:55:58.127
I was the one doin'
all the sacrificin'.

863
00:56:02.603 --> 00:56:06.198
And now for our devoted listeners,
back to the show.

864
00:56:08.309 --> 00:56:10.470
Letme try thatdildo.

865
00:56:13.147 --> 00:56:14.876
Now waitjust a minute.

866
00:56:14.982 --> 00:56:17.883
Stiflerwanted to give
you two handjobs?

867
00:56:17.985 --> 00:56:21.785
No. Stiflerwanted one from us.

868
00:56:21.889 --> 00:56:23.789
What? Bullshit.

869
00:56:23.891 --> 00:56:25.654
He did.
And it was horrible.

870
00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.455
Very horrible.

871
00:56:27.561 --> 00:56:30.029
You guys, you wanna
play some "asshole"?

872
00:56:30.131 --> 00:56:32.759
Just watching the game, Kev.

873
00:56:32.867 --> 00:56:34.926
I just wanna
do something together.

874
00:56:35.036 --> 00:56:37.129
Wejust did something together.

875
00:56:37.238 --> 00:56:40.207
- Very together.
- Ho, ho, ho.

876
00:56:40.307 --> 00:56:42.366
Stifler Claus is here.

877
00:56:42.476 --> 00:56:45.309
Now,just so there's no confusion...

878
00:56:45.413 --> 00:56:48.814
Santa Porn hasjust brought us
some heterosexual entertainment.

879
00:56:50.551 --> 00:56:51.449
Hereyou go.

880
00:56:52.653 --> 00:56:54.450
All right. Here.

881
00:56:54.555 --> 00:56:57.285
And the Stifmeister's provided us
some complimentary lubricant.

882
00:56:57.391 --> 00:56:59.325
Whack away,Jim. Whack away.

883
00:56:59.427 --> 00:57:01.190
Does this stuffreally
make a difference?

884
00:57:01.295 --> 00:57:02.762
Oh, yeah!

885
00:57:02.863 --> 00:57:04.057
Really?

886
00:57:09.804 --> 00:57:12.204
Stifmeister's palace oflove--

887
00:57:12.306 --> 00:57:13.864
straight love.

888
00:57:15.076 --> 00:57:17.943
Oh, hey.
Yeah, I'm fine.

889
00:57:18.045 --> 00:57:19.706
- How aboutyou?
- That's Stifler's mom.

890
00:57:19.814 --> 00:57:21.213
Silence.

891
00:57:21.315 --> 00:57:23.306
I didn't really thinkyou were gonna be
in Michigan this summer.

892
00:57:23.417 --> 00:57:25.408
Yeah, you're more than welcome
to be here.

893
00:57:25.519 --> 00:57:28.886
Okay, stop by in a couple ofweeks.
We're having a big party.

894
00:57:28.989 --> 00:57:30.581
Okay, bye.

895
00:57:30.691 --> 00:57:32.056
Stifler, was that--

896
00:57:35.629 --> 00:57:37.187
She's coming.

897
00:57:41.936 --> 00:57:43.961
Stifler's mom is coming here.

898
00:57:47.108 --> 00:57:49.099
Efforts must be doubled.

899
00:57:50.544 --> 00:57:52.478
"Efforts must be doubled."

900
00:57:54.915 --> 00:57:56.212
Absolutely.

901
00:58:03.691 --> 00:58:05.591
Jenny, where'd you put
my clarinet?

902
00:58:05.693 --> 00:58:08.287
- I think I shoved it in your box.
- Thanks.

903
00:58:08.395 --> 00:58:12.263
Bad man.
I'm a bad, bad man.

904
00:58:16.270 --> 00:58:18.238
Jim, what areyou
doing here?

905
00:58:18.339 --> 00:58:20.807
I-- Well, I thought
you had said--

906
00:58:20.908 --> 00:58:23.638
You can'tjust
stand out here.

907
00:58:23.744 --> 00:58:27.578
Look, I need your help.

908
00:58:27.681 --> 00:58:29.774
Nadia's coming back...

909
00:58:29.884 --> 00:58:31.784
and I don't--

910
00:58:31.886 --> 00:58:33.945
I don't wanna be this awkward...

911
00:58:34.054 --> 00:58:37.114
bumbling, nervous guywith her.

912
00:58:37.224 --> 00:58:38.859
I don't wanna seem
like a dork.

913
00:58:38.959 --> 00:58:41.154
Well, I know that feeling.

914
00:58:41.262 --> 00:58:43.355
Spend your life playing
in the band...

915
00:58:43.464 --> 00:58:47.457
it doesn't exactly giveyou
the ultra-cool hipster image.

916
00:58:47.568 --> 00:58:51.197
- I thinkyou're pretty cool.
- Seriously?

917
00:58:55.643 --> 00:58:58.976
Michelle, why did you
ditch me after prom?

918
00:58:59.079 --> 00:59:03.072
I didn't ditch you.
I just--

919
00:59:03.184 --> 00:59:04.617
Our date was over.

920
00:59:05.519 --> 00:59:07.749
I mean, did you want some...

921
00:59:07.855 --> 00:59:10.415
funky, weird,
next-morning good-bye?

922
00:59:12.226 --> 00:59:15.821
It's not like I wanted you to pretend
you were in love with me or something.

923
00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:17.795
Whywould I pretend that?

924
00:59:17.898 --> 00:59:19.593
Guys do that.

925
00:59:20.968 --> 00:59:24.529
Yeah, well,
I'm not like other guys.

926
00:59:25.639 --> 00:59:27.300
I know.

927
00:59:27.408 --> 00:59:30.536
Okay, I'm gonna helpyou.

928
00:59:30.644 --> 00:59:32.544
Really?

929
00:59:32.646 --> 00:59:35.308
Yeah, I feel bad
for saying thatyou sucked...

930
00:59:35.416 --> 00:59:38.442
even though you kind ofdid.

931
00:59:41.021 --> 00:59:43.114
I'm just--

932
00:59:43.224 --> 00:59:45.124
Let'sjust get started.

933
00:59:46.227 --> 00:59:48.695
- Now, I'm a hot girl.
- Right.

934
00:59:48.796 --> 00:59:51.697
- Okay, what doyou wanna do?
- I wanna feel your boobs.

935
00:59:51.799 --> 00:59:53.824
No, you dingbat.

936
00:59:53.934 --> 00:59:56.437
You don'tjust go
groping away.

937
00:59:56.437 --> 00:59:56.766
You don'tjust go
groping away.

938
00:59:56.870 --> 00:59:59.940
You gotta preheat the oven
beforeyou stick in the turkey.

939
01:00:03.611 --> 01:00:05.101
Kiss me, here.

940
01:00:11.385 --> 01:00:13.444
Good. Okay, now...

941
01:00:13.554 --> 01:00:15.044
the collarbone-- kiss.

942
01:00:19.827 --> 01:00:22.421
Good,Jim.

943
01:00:22.529 --> 01:00:23.962
You're making me wet.

944
01:00:24.064 --> 01:00:25.395
Holy shit. Really?

945
01:00:25.499 --> 01:00:27.626
No, I wasjust saying that
soyou could practice.

946
01:00:29.503 --> 01:00:30.993
Ofcourse.

947
01:00:51.625 --> 01:00:56.153
Does direction matter,
like clockwise, counterclockwise?

948
01:00:56.263 --> 01:00:58.697
Okay,Jim,
this is what I'm talking about.

949
01:00:58.799 --> 01:01:03.065
Your main problem is
you're so uptight.

950
01:01:04.305 --> 01:01:07.741
Do I seem uptight
about my sexual stuff? No.

951
01:01:07.841 --> 01:01:11.038
The biggest pointer
I could giveyou is...

952
01:01:11.145 --> 01:01:15.639
you have to feel comfortable
in any situation.

953
01:01:15.749 --> 01:01:17.051
Stand up.

954
01:01:18.052 --> 01:01:18.950
Stand up.

955
01:01:20.354 --> 01:01:24.051
- Now, this is a fucked-up situation.
- What happened to preheating?

956
01:01:24.158 --> 01:01:26.752
- We're skipping a few chapters.
- Oh, okay.

957
01:01:26.860 --> 01:01:30.591
This is good. This is good.
Obviously.

958
01:01:32.132 --> 01:01:35.499
- Gilligan's Island, Mr. Howell.
- What?

959
01:01:35.602 --> 01:01:39.436
You've got to control yourself
and think ofsomething nonsexual.

960
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.067
I haven't even touched you yet,
and you're turning into the Sears Tower.

961
01:01:43.177 --> 01:01:46.044
I'm sorry.
Yeah, nonsexual.

962
01:01:46.146 --> 01:01:48.740
Right, right.
Okay.

963
01:01:48.849 --> 01:01:51.647
- Chairs.
- Good.

964
01:01:54.521 --> 01:01:55.647
Mastodons.

965
01:01:58.359 --> 01:02:00.554
Cleaning my bathroom.

966
01:02:01.795 --> 01:02:03.786
- Dung beetles.
- Good.

967
01:02:03.897 --> 01:02:06.388
- Yeah.
- Okay. Now, don't freak out.

968
01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:09.492
I'm gonna do something
to push your threshold.

969
01:02:09.603 --> 01:02:11.572
Oh, that's cold!
What areyou doing?

970
01:02:11.572 --> 01:02:12.004
Oh, that's cold!
What areyou doing?

971
01:02:12.106 --> 01:02:15.075
I just shoved a trumpet in your ass.
Aren't instruments fun?

972
01:02:15.342 --> 01:02:18.743
Okay, I thinkyou'vejust
crossed my threshold.

973
01:02:28.455 --> 01:02:32.186
Call me in two weeks. I'll be home then.
We can finish lessons.

974
01:02:32.292 --> 01:02:34.089
Okay.

975
01:02:38.732 --> 01:02:40.757
Pointer--
less tongue.

976
01:02:59.453 --> 01:03:02.616
- What is it? A guest book?
- Yeah, and look at this entry.

977
01:03:02.723 --> 01:03:05.419
"Best thing was the blowout
at Tom Meyers' place.

978
01:03:05.526 --> 01:03:07.892
- There he is.
- A night not soon to be forgotten.

979
01:03:07.995 --> 01:03:10.623
August '93."
It's your brother, man. Look.

980
01:03:10.731 --> 01:03:12.562
Yeah, his cottage was
right down on the beach.

981
01:03:12.666 --> 01:03:16.227
Guys, this is what
our party's gotta be.

982
01:03:16.336 --> 01:03:19.066
- Something we'll always remember.
- Yes, definitely.

983
01:03:19.173 --> 01:03:20.731
Absolutely.

984
01:03:22.342 --> 01:03:24.970
- You go fish.
- Finch, we're playing gin.

985
01:03:28.949 --> 01:03:29.817
Gin.

986
01:03:29.817 --> 01:03:30.306
Gin.

987
01:04:21.535 --> 01:04:22.934
What the fuck?

988
01:05:02.676 --> 01:05:03.911
"DearJim.

989
01:05:05.712 --> 01:05:09.443
Chicago is beautiful,
but it would be better ifyou were here.

990
01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:12.383
I'm counting the days.
Love, Nadia."

991
01:05:15.355 --> 01:05:17.823
Well, I wish
you were here, Nadia.

992
01:05:46.093 --> 01:05:49.620
- Haveyoubeen dirty?
- Oh, yes, baby. I'vebeen dirty.

993
01:05:51.732 --> 01:05:53.632
Doyou wantme to cleanyou?

994
01:05:53.734 --> 01:05:57.431
"Apply a few drops
to achieve desired lubrication."

995
01:05:57.538 --> 01:05:59.199
All right.

996
01:06:03.377 --> 01:06:06.869
Is thataloofah,
orareyoujustgladtoseeme?

997
01:06:06.981 --> 01:06:08.881
What the hell.

998
01:06:27.735 --> 01:06:29.464
Shit.

999
01:06:33.674 --> 01:06:36.006
God!

1000
01:06:36.110 --> 01:06:38.169
I been missin' out.

1001
01:06:56.530 --> 01:06:58.327
Oh, shit!

1002
01:07:04.505 --> 01:07:05.631
Shit!

1003
01:07:11.912 --> 01:07:14.642
- Everybody okay?
- I'm fine.

1004
01:07:14.748 --> 01:07:16.409
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.

1005
01:07:16.517 --> 01:07:19.315
Shut the fuck up or I'll break down
this door and pummel your ass!

1006
01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:23.220
No, don't come in here. I'm fine.
I just fell out ofthe bed.

1007
01:07:23.324 --> 01:07:25.224
- You sure?
- Okay, good night, then.

1008
01:07:25.326 --> 01:07:27.260
- 'Night.
- We'll seeyou in the morning.

1009
01:07:41.308 --> 01:07:42.605
Shit!
Oh, shit!

1010
01:08:07.835 --> 01:08:09.962
- Poison control.
- Hello?

1011
01:08:14.608 --> 01:08:16.803
Yeah, I kind of...

1012
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:18.741
Super Glued myself...

1013
01:08:18.846 --> 01:08:21.582
to myself.

1014
01:08:24.918 --> 01:08:26.613
Don't send an ambulance.

1015
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:30.781
Look, is there anything, you know,
around the house?

1016
01:08:34.528 --> 01:08:36.928
Paint thinner.

1017
01:09:32.519 --> 01:09:33.850
Shit.

1018
01:09:40.360 --> 01:09:43.158
Don't move!
Staywhereyou are!

1019
01:09:43.263 --> 01:09:45.697
Hands where we can see 'em!

1020
01:09:45.799 --> 01:09:48.359
Both hands!
Get the other hand up, goddamn it!

1021
01:09:49.937 --> 01:09:52.337
I can't! I can't!
I'm glued!

1022
01:09:52.439 --> 01:09:56.432
I'm glued!
Sorry.

1023
01:09:56.543 --> 01:09:59.478
Relaxyour hands.

1024
01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:02.481
I'll take it from here, okay?

1025
01:10:02.583 --> 01:10:04.517
Don't worry,Jimbo.
You're gonna be fine, buddy.

1026
01:10:04.618 --> 01:10:07.178
Jim, this happens
to the best ofus.

1027
01:10:12.326 --> 01:10:15.124
Left foot first.
Easy does it. Good.

1028
01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:18.892
- Watch your head.
- All right. Take a seat.

1029
01:10:20.868 --> 01:10:23.234
Excuse me, sir.
Areyou a family member?

1030
01:10:23.337 --> 01:10:25.862
Fuck, no!
This isjust too good to miss!

1031
01:10:25.973 --> 01:10:28.806
Okay, sir, you'rejust gonna have
to wait here. All right?

1032
01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:38.277
This summer's
turned out to be great.

1033
01:10:53.467 --> 01:10:57.301
Mucilage is, uh,
dangerous territory...

1034
01:10:57.404 --> 01:11:01.966
and I would think
any adhesive product...

1035
01:11:02.075 --> 01:11:05.010
would have a warning
right on the tube.

1036
01:11:06.213 --> 01:11:08.977
I thought it was a lubricant.

1037
01:11:09.082 --> 01:11:11.346
I was trying to use...

1038
01:11:11.451 --> 01:11:12.975
lubricant.

1039
01:11:19.493 --> 01:11:22.792
Son, couldn'tyou have left
that disgusting thing at home?

1040
01:11:24.264 --> 01:11:26.198
Excuse me?

1041
01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.497
Well, that kind ofmaterial
is offensive to me.

1042
01:11:29.603 --> 01:11:33.004
Oh, well, we're sorry.

1043
01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:37.143
But, you see,
my son couldn't leave it at home...

1044
01:11:37.244 --> 01:11:40.475
because he's having
a bit ofa medical emergency.

1045
01:11:40.581 --> 01:11:41.479
Thanks, Dad.

1046
01:11:41.582 --> 01:11:44.881
Your opinion ofhis taste
in video rentals, I'm afraid...

1047
01:11:44.985 --> 01:11:46.976
is not a priority, lady.

1048
01:11:47.087 --> 01:11:48.486
Okay, Dad.

1049
01:11:48.589 --> 01:11:51.217
It's at the bottom
ofthe totem pole.

1050
01:11:53.894 --> 01:11:55.794
Thankyou. Okay?

1051
01:11:55.896 --> 01:11:57.830
My son...

1052
01:11:57.931 --> 01:11:59.899
is sitting here right now...

1053
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.696
with his hand
glued to his penis!

1054
01:12:04.171 --> 01:12:06.366
But that doesn't mean
anything toyou, does it?

1055
01:12:06.473 --> 01:12:08.737
Becauseyou don't have a penis!

1056
01:12:08.842 --> 01:12:10.742
- Or maybeyou do!
- Dad!

1057
01:12:10.844 --> 01:12:13.278
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1058
01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:16.543
You know, itjust bugs me
when people speak...

1059
01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:18.550
before they think.

1060
01:12:18.652 --> 01:12:21.177
You know, ifthey speak.

1061
01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:29.087
- Howyou doin', son?
- I've been better.

1062
01:12:32.499 --> 01:12:35.059
Boy, that doesn't look
too bad,Jim.

1063
01:12:35.168 --> 01:12:37.159
Goodjob, Doctor.

1064
01:12:37.271 --> 01:12:40.468
The swelling should subside
in about eight or nine days.

1065
01:12:40.574 --> 01:12:42.235
Eight or nine--

1066
01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:46.575
Beach party's in a week.
Nadia's coming.

1067
01:12:50.617 --> 01:12:54.246
Doctor, my son has
a party in seven days...

1068
01:12:54.354 --> 01:12:56.379
and there's a young lady coming...

1069
01:12:56.490 --> 01:12:58.617
that he's been waiting to--

1070
01:13:00.494 --> 01:13:02.792
he's been waiting to get with.

1071
01:13:02.896 --> 01:13:06.354
I'd tell your son to keep
his pants on during that party.

1072
01:13:06.466 --> 01:13:10.334
Oh, yes. Believe me, I will be
doing that. It goes without saying.

1073
01:13:10.437 --> 01:13:12.962
But ifhis pants...

1074
01:13:13.073 --> 01:13:15.234
decide to come off
during the party...

1075
01:13:15.342 --> 01:13:18.402
could he have
full use ofhis...

1076
01:13:21.114 --> 01:13:22.138
penis?

1077
01:13:22.249 --> 01:13:23.807
Okay.

1078
01:13:26.520 --> 01:13:28.750
This should shave
a couple ofdays off.

1079
01:13:28.855 --> 01:13:31.449
Oh, good.

1080
01:13:31.558 --> 01:13:33.583
Thankyou, Doctor.

1081
01:13:33.694 --> 01:13:36.060
Jim...

1082
01:13:36.163 --> 01:13:38.927
that's good news.

1083
01:13:39.032 --> 01:13:42.593
This has been a good-news day, son.
Here. Put this on.

1084
01:13:42.703 --> 01:13:44.193
Little chilly out there.

1085
01:13:46.673 --> 01:13:49.403
Well, here we are.

1086
01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:51.500
You know,Jim...

1087
01:13:51.611 --> 01:13:55.308
I thinkwe should keepyour mother
in the dark about the incident tonight.

1088
01:13:55.415 --> 01:13:58.782
I think the whole glue thing
might get her a little queasy.

1089
01:13:58.885 --> 01:14:02.377
I don't know how I get
myselfinto these things.

1090
01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:08.187
But thanks for understanding.

1091
01:14:08.295 --> 01:14:10.923
You've been really cool.

1092
01:14:11.031 --> 01:14:13.022
I mean, between this and...

1093
01:14:13.133 --> 01:14:14.862
you know--

1094
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:20.997
You know, you may be
Jimbo orJumbo...

1095
01:14:21.108 --> 01:14:24.202
orJimbodinny to these guys
in here, but...

1096
01:14:24.311 --> 01:14:26.973
I wantyou to know
there are two people...

1097
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.516
who still rememberwhere
James Emanuel Levenstein came from.

1098
01:14:32.419 --> 01:14:35.582
We're awful proud ofyou, son.

1099
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:37.418
Thanks, Dad.

1100
01:14:37.591 --> 01:14:40.389
Don't forgetyour penis cream.

1101
01:15:00.614 --> 01:15:02.707
That was it.

1102
01:15:02.816 --> 01:15:06.718
Right there.
That was a pure tantric moment.

1103
01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.688
The ficus, the water--
it was all erotic.

1104
01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:15.558
One more stimulant,
I would have had full release.

1105
01:15:15.662 --> 01:15:19.826
Finch, stay the fuck
away from that ficus.

1106
01:15:19.933 --> 01:15:21.560
That's ajizz-free ficus.

1107
01:15:23.937 --> 01:15:28.067
There he is. Morning,Jimbo.
How's the twig and giggleberries, man?

1108
01:15:28.175 --> 01:15:31.511
Oh, very colorful.
My dick looks like a paint-by-numbers.

1109
01:15:33.747 --> 01:15:36.545
You're the only guy I know
whose dick needs an instruction manual.

1110
01:15:48.028 --> 01:15:50.861
What, you're here now?
No, that's cool.

1111
01:15:50.964 --> 01:15:53.558
You know, ifyou want to
hang out with these guys.

1112
01:15:53.667 --> 01:15:55.862
Okay, then.
I'll meetyou out front.

1113
01:15:59.005 --> 01:16:01.872
- Hey, Stifler, was that--
- Eat shit, Shitbreak.

1114
01:16:05.412 --> 01:16:06.379
She's here.

1115
01:16:08.815 --> 01:16:11.443
My lady has arrived.

1116
01:16:13.854 --> 01:16:16.550
- I gotta prepare.
- Here we go.

1117
01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:19.784
- Great. Stifler's mom is here?
- This could be a disaster.

1118
01:16:23.096 --> 01:16:25.656
Not unless Stifler's mom
drives a moped.

1119
01:16:25.765 --> 01:16:26.789
Moped?

1120
01:16:30.370 --> 01:16:33.828
Fuckers, fuckers, fuckers.
Howyou doin', boys?

1121
01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:37.307
- That's Stifler's little brother.
- What areyou doing here?

1122
01:16:37.410 --> 01:16:39.901
Pussy, man.
I'm here for the pussy.

1123
01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:41.776
Take a number.

1124
01:16:41.882 --> 01:16:45.409
Gentlemen, why all the noise?
Everybody knows this is my special day.

1125
01:16:45.519 --> 01:16:48.147
- What is that?
- Is that a fuckin' dress?

1126
01:16:48.255 --> 01:16:52.885
- Areyou wearing a dress?
- Shitbreak, meet my little brother.

1127
01:16:52.993 --> 01:16:54.688
Little brother, meet Shitbreak.

1128
01:16:55.929 --> 01:16:58.124
- That's your brother?
- Yes.

1129
01:17:00.967 --> 01:17:02.628
My lady's not coming.

1130
01:17:04.571 --> 01:17:07.438
So my entire...

1131
01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:09.566
stockpile is wasted...

1132
01:17:09.676 --> 01:17:11.940
and I look ridiculous!

1133
01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:15.038
Excuse me.

1134
01:17:20.487 --> 01:17:22.853
- That didn't look too good.
- No.

1135
01:17:22.956 --> 01:17:27.916
- Let's go find your room.
- So, where are the fuckin' females?

1136
01:17:30.864 --> 01:17:33.332
I can't believe
I finally gotyou alone.

1137
01:17:33.433 --> 01:17:35.492
That only took, what, six weeks?

1138
01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:39.332
So, areyou alone too?

1139
01:17:39.439 --> 01:17:41.907
- Yep.
- Good.

1140
01:17:42.008 --> 01:17:45.671
I'm all alone.

1141
01:17:45.779 --> 01:17:48.543
Guess what I had in mind?

1142
01:17:51.818 --> 01:17:54.252
Hey, Marco,
can you getyour balls offme?

1143
01:17:54.354 --> 01:17:57.323
- Thanks.
- What the hell's going on over there?

1144
01:17:57.424 --> 01:18:01.360
Nothing.
It'sjust my flatmates.

1145
01:18:01.461 --> 01:18:03.429
I guess this is kind of
a lost cause, huh?

1146
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:05.623
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Seeya this weekend?

1147
01:18:05.732 --> 01:18:07.757
- I can't wait.
- I can't wait either.

1148
01:18:07.867 --> 01:18:09.027
Bye-bye.

1149
01:18:13.974 --> 01:18:16.704
- Surprise!
- Holy-- Nadia!

1150
01:18:16.810 --> 01:18:20.211
You're here? You're here.
What areyou doing here?

1151
01:18:20.313 --> 01:18:22.247
Jim, I got so tired
ofsightseeing.

1152
01:18:22.349 --> 01:18:24.681
Butyou're--you're early.

1153
01:18:24.784 --> 01:18:28.515
Okay.
Nice to knowyou.

1154
01:18:28.622 --> 01:18:31.216
- I will leave.
- No!

1155
01:18:31.324 --> 01:18:34.760
No.
Don't-- Don't leave.

1156
01:18:34.861 --> 01:18:36.886
Don't leave.
No leaving.

1157
01:18:40.467 --> 01:18:44.267
It'sjust,
I'm not gonna be ready--

1158
01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:48.432
I mean, the partywon't be
ready until Saturday.

1159
01:18:50.043 --> 01:18:52.477
I can stay here until then?

1160
01:18:52.579 --> 01:18:54.137
Yeah.

1161
01:18:55.348 --> 01:18:57.475
I'm gonna be right back.
Is that okay?

1162
01:18:57.584 --> 01:19:00.144
- Okay.
- Nadia.

1163
01:19:00.253 --> 01:19:03.745
Who's in my room.
Now. Holy shit.

1164
01:19:05.125 --> 01:19:07.116
Allright, I'vegotaplan.

1165
01:19:07.227 --> 01:19:09.787
Okay.
How about I come backwith you...

1166
01:19:09.896 --> 01:19:11.488
and you say...

1167
01:19:11.598 --> 01:19:13.828
"Hello, this is Michelle,
my girlfriend."

1168
01:19:13.933 --> 01:19:17.460
And obviously, Nadia won't
expectyou to hop in the sack.

1169
01:19:17.570 --> 01:19:21.131
And then we break up
the day ofthe party.

1170
01:19:21.241 --> 01:19:23.266
And you're all healed
and back on the market.

1171
01:19:24.711 --> 01:19:27.236
- You're evil.
- No way!

1172
01:19:27.347 --> 01:19:29.440
I'm like Cupid.

1173
01:19:29.549 --> 01:19:32.040
And I know how
to make a girl jealous.

1174
01:19:32.152 --> 01:19:33.915
This is gonna be fun.

1175
01:19:34.020 --> 01:19:35.988
I'm sorry I didn't
tell you sooner...

1176
01:19:36.089 --> 01:19:38.489
but wejust started seeing
each other a few weeks ago.

1177
01:19:41.461 --> 01:19:44.726
But I'd really love it
ifyou stayed here.

1178
01:19:44.831 --> 01:19:47.629
I thinkyou should stay
and have fun at the party.

1179
01:19:47.734 --> 01:19:51.295
Good for you,Jim.
Ofcourse I will stay.

1180
01:19:51.404 --> 01:19:54.339
That's great--
That's my nipples!

1181
01:19:54.441 --> 01:19:57.205
Shejust loves my nipples.

1182
01:21:29.869 --> 01:21:31.538
- Oh, my God.
- You still broken?

1183
01:21:31.538 --> 01:21:32.630
- Oh, my God.
- You still broken?

1184
01:21:34.808 --> 01:21:36.799
I'm fine.

1185
01:21:36.910 --> 01:21:40.141
I might have to
actually go through with this.

1186
01:21:43.249 --> 01:21:45.979
What's the big deal
with Nadia, anyway?

1187
01:21:46.085 --> 01:21:49.987
I mean, okay, so she's
50,000 times hotter...

1188
01:21:50.089 --> 01:21:51.989
than most girls, but...

1189
01:21:52.091 --> 01:21:54.184
come on, it'sjust sex.

1190
01:21:56.296 --> 01:21:58.560
You saw the thing on the Internet.

1191
01:21:58.665 --> 01:22:00.895
Did it look like I might have had...

1192
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.628
a slight interest in Nadia then?

1193
01:22:05.405 --> 01:22:07.305
Add anotheryear to that.

1194
01:22:07.407 --> 01:22:09.568
Okay.

1195
01:22:09.676 --> 01:22:15.080
Hey, why don'tyou bring Nadia to
the concert first? It'll be a cool date.

1196
01:22:16.115 --> 01:22:18.015
We'll see how things go.

1197
01:22:23.122 --> 01:22:26.922
Michelle, you have been great.

1198
01:22:27.026 --> 01:22:28.687
Thankyou.

1199
01:22:28.795 --> 01:22:30.387
Anytime.

1200
01:22:37.537 --> 01:22:39.266
Come on.

1201
01:22:42.375 --> 01:22:44.570
You ready to break up?

1202
01:22:44.677 --> 01:22:46.975
You big, stupid dummy!

1203
01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.344
Theater is so cool!

1204
01:22:49.449 --> 01:22:52.782
I don't care ifyou are the best lay
I've ever had in my life.

1205
01:22:52.886 --> 01:22:56.014
- I hateyour guts anyway.
- Don't say that.

1206
01:22:56.122 --> 01:23:01.185
And I don't care ifyou did give me
ten orgasms in a row...

1207
01:23:01.294 --> 01:23:03.228
becauseyou smell really bad.

1208
01:23:05.899 --> 01:23:07.628
I smell really bad!

1209
01:23:07.734 --> 01:23:11.226
Because we've been having
so much sex, and--

1210
01:23:11.337 --> 01:23:14.829
and I haven't showered,
and I wanna shower!

1211
01:23:16.442 --> 01:23:20.344
So, don'tyou go being all
super sexy guy anymore...

1212
01:23:20.446 --> 01:23:22.846
because I am now impervious...

1213
01:23:22.949 --> 01:23:26.680
toyour unrelenting machismo
and sexual ardor.

1214
01:23:27.620 --> 01:23:30.851
And that includes fucking me
in the ass! So there!

1215
01:23:38.598 --> 01:23:40.623
We had something special.

1216
01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:19.536
- What's up?
- What's up, dog?

1217
01:24:22.508 --> 01:24:24.408
Vicki. Hey.

1218
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:27.877
I'm so glad you came.
You want something to drink or--

1219
01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:29.778
Can I helpyou?

1220
01:24:31.217 --> 01:24:32.445
- Kevin.
- What?

1221
01:24:32.552 --> 01:24:33.917
That's my date.

1222
01:24:49.569 --> 01:24:51.764
You-- You saved them all.

1223
01:24:51.871 --> 01:24:53.498
How sweet.

1224
01:24:54.607 --> 01:24:56.507
You don't think I'm a dork?

1225
01:24:59.379 --> 01:25:03.748
Whateveryou are,Jim,
it is what I like.

1226
01:25:05.618 --> 01:25:07.609
Kevin left.
Didn't look good.

1227
01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:09.745
Kevin left?

1228
01:25:10.656 --> 01:25:12.425
Just wandered down the beach.

1229
01:25:16.529 --> 01:25:18.394
You okay, Kev?

1230
01:25:21.701 --> 01:25:23.532
Wanna tell us what's up?

1231
01:25:25.271 --> 01:25:27.432
Wanna feel Finch's ass?

1232
01:25:31.044 --> 01:25:34.445
No, I--
I went to say hi to Vicky...

1233
01:25:34.547 --> 01:25:37.311
and she was there with a date.

1234
01:25:37.417 --> 01:25:39.942
You hooked up with three girls
this year. You're doing fine.

1235
01:25:40.053 --> 01:25:41.987
Rule ofthree, Oz.

1236
01:25:48.127 --> 01:25:50.925
I guess I was living in the past--
wanting to partywith you guys...

1237
01:25:51.030 --> 01:25:53.521
and be with Vicky,
just like high school.

1238
01:25:53.633 --> 01:25:56.124
You remember
that day after prom?

1239
01:25:56.235 --> 01:25:58.965
You know, we made
a toast to the next step.

1240
01:26:00.306 --> 01:26:02.900
I guess I never took it.

1241
01:26:05.144 --> 01:26:08.511
My brother said that by the end
ofthe summer I'd see the big picture.

1242
01:26:08.614 --> 01:26:10.582
And I see it.

1243
01:26:10.683 --> 01:26:14.278
No matterwhat, times change
and things are different.

1244
01:26:14.387 --> 01:26:17.845
The problem is,
I don't want them to be.

1245
01:26:17.957 --> 01:26:20.016
You know, Kevin,
I haven't moved on either.

1246
01:26:20.126 --> 01:26:24.495
I've been obsessed with the one woman
I can't have a real future with...

1247
01:26:24.597 --> 01:26:28.590
other than a very kinky,
extremelywarped one.

1248
01:26:30.069 --> 01:26:32.333
I got to find a new goddess.

1249
01:26:33.873 --> 01:26:37.240
It's gonna take patience,
but I've been celibate all summer.

1250
01:26:37.343 --> 01:26:41.404
- You kinda get used to it, though, huh?
- Areyou insane?

1251
01:26:44.217 --> 01:26:48.381
Look, Kev, different does not
necessarily mean worse.

1252
01:26:48.488 --> 01:26:51.355
As a matter offact,
I think things arejust getting better.

1253
01:26:51.524 --> 01:26:54.618
Or am I gonna have to drag your ass
back to that party and prove it toyou?

1254
01:26:55.895 --> 01:26:57.089
I'll walk.

1255
01:27:12.345 --> 01:27:13.573
Wow.

1256
01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:17.474
You know,
you have beautiful eyes.

1257
01:27:17.583 --> 01:27:21.644
- Oh, you're sweet.
- That's a really nice top.

1258
01:27:21.754 --> 01:27:25.155
- Oh. Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1259
01:27:25.258 --> 01:27:28.489
- Wanna fuck?
- Areyou serious?

1260
01:27:28.594 --> 01:27:31.722
Come on, baby.
Give it to the Stifmeister.

1261
01:27:31.831 --> 01:27:34.698
- I thinkyou better--
- Your loss.

1262
01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:37.860
Wow. You know,
you have beautiful eyes.

1263
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:41.497
Come here, dude. Come on.
You're making an ass out ofyourself.

1264
01:27:41.607 --> 01:27:45.008
You're ruining my mojo.
And you're not the Stifmeister, okay?

1265
01:27:45.111 --> 01:27:47.477
It takes years to develop
true Stifmeister style.

1266
01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:50.879
Come on, man!
I just wanna see some boobs.

1267
01:27:50.983 --> 01:27:52.746
- Hey, Pop Tart.
- Dream on, midget.

1268
01:27:52.852 --> 01:27:56.288
Excuse him. Come here.
Take this. You're on cop watch.

1269
01:27:56.389 --> 01:27:59.256
Go out in the driveway.
See any cops, call me, okay?

1270
01:27:59.358 --> 01:28:01.087
All right.

1271
01:28:11.204 --> 01:28:15.163
Gentlemen,
this appears to be a party.

1272
01:28:18.110 --> 01:28:21.568
Guys, ifyou'll excuse me,
I'm gonna go look for Nadia.

1273
01:28:21.681 --> 01:28:23.444
Good luck.

1274
01:28:26.452 --> 01:28:29.080
So what was this year like for you?

1275
01:28:29.188 --> 01:28:31.383
Did you miss high school?

1276
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:33.481
Well, no.

1277
01:28:33.593 --> 01:28:37.222
When you travel as much as I do,
you get used to moving on.

1278
01:28:38.598 --> 01:28:40.998
But I have great memories.

1279
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:47.596
- Wow, can we go in there?
- The lighthouse?

1280
01:28:52.778 --> 01:28:54.507
Yes, we can.

1281
01:28:54.614 --> 01:28:56.479
How romantic.

1282
01:28:59.118 --> 01:29:00.415
Jim, come on.

1283
01:29:17.403 --> 01:29:20.600
Oh, it's beautiful!

1284
01:29:20.706 --> 01:29:22.367
Cool!

1285
01:29:25.011 --> 01:29:29.380
Jim, I have told you
my memories from high school.

1286
01:29:29.482 --> 01:29:31.211
What areyours?

1287
01:29:36.922 --> 01:29:38.014
You.

1288
01:29:38.124 --> 01:29:40.354
You have not changed.

1289
01:29:45.031 --> 01:29:48.091
Jim, relax.

1290
01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:52.534
We arejust, how doyou say,
tooting our horns.

1291
01:29:53.706 --> 01:29:55.640
Actually,
that is quite difficult.

1292
01:29:55.741 --> 01:29:56.935
What doyou mean?

1293
01:29:57.843 --> 01:30:01.074
Well, this one time
at band camp--

1294
01:30:06.519 --> 01:30:08.612
Holy shit.

1295
01:30:09.922 --> 01:30:12.049
What? Tell me.

1296
01:30:13.459 --> 01:30:16.895
Well, this one time at band camp...

1297
01:30:18.130 --> 01:30:20.189
I got stuck playing this trombone.

1298
01:30:20.299 --> 01:30:23.427
And I can't play anything at all.
So I totally sucked.

1299
01:30:23.536 --> 01:30:25.470
And everyone thought
I was this Petey guy...

1300
01:30:25.571 --> 01:30:28.506
but I didn't know what to think,
so I just kept playing and playing...

1301
01:30:28.607 --> 01:30:30.234
and I didn't know what I was doing.

1302
01:30:30.343 --> 01:30:32.243
It was so funny!

1303
01:30:33.779 --> 01:30:36.839
- I gotta go.
- What? Why?

1304
01:30:39.752 --> 01:30:41.652
Please don't take this
the wrong way...

1305
01:30:41.754 --> 01:30:44.188
but, butyou're--

1306
01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:47.350
you're everything
that I used to want.

1307
01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:50.520
And as much as I may really...

1308
01:30:50.629 --> 01:30:54.326
really regret
what I'm about to do...

1309
01:30:55.835 --> 01:30:57.700
there's somebody else
I want to be with.

1310
01:30:57.803 --> 01:31:01.068
You want the band geek?

1311
01:31:01.173 --> 01:31:05.041
Nadia, I am a band geek.

1312
01:31:06.545 --> 01:31:09.309
I just neverjoined the band.

1313
01:31:14.086 --> 01:31:15.986
You go getyour geek.

1314
01:31:17.656 --> 01:31:19.453
Someday I will find mine.

1315
01:31:38.344 --> 01:31:41.643
Hey, Kevin Meyers.

1316
01:31:41.747 --> 01:31:43.908
Hi.
Sorry I was a dick before.

1317
01:31:44.016 --> 01:31:46.849
It's okay, man.
My name's Brett.

1318
01:31:46.952 --> 01:31:49.750
- Could you give us a sec?
- Sure.

1319
01:31:51.190 --> 01:31:53.351
Look, you don't have to do this.

1320
01:31:53.459 --> 01:31:55.950
Maybe I was being selfish...

1321
01:31:56.061 --> 01:31:59.428
in wanting to beyour friend.

1322
01:31:59.532 --> 01:32:02.194
Maybe it'sjust not gonna work.

1323
01:32:02.301 --> 01:32:05.828
I would much rather haveyou as a friend
than not haveyou in my life at all.

1324
01:32:19.251 --> 01:32:21.151
Party on!

1325
01:32:26.759 --> 01:32:30.286
- From the lighthouse all the way--
- Hey, handsome.

1326
01:32:37.369 --> 01:32:38.927
What areyou doing here?

1327
01:32:39.038 --> 01:32:41.404
I was gonna pickyou up
at the airport in two hours.

1328
01:32:41.507 --> 01:32:43.771
I took an earlier flight,
and I thought I'd surpriseyou.

1329
01:32:43.876 --> 01:32:47.744
- Yeah, you did.
- Kinda weird without the phone, huh?

1330
01:32:47.847 --> 01:32:50.077
We'll get used to it.

1331
01:32:50.182 --> 01:32:53.481
Come on. I wanna hear all about it.
Gonna grabyou a drink.

1332
01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:57.116
Steve, this cop-watch
thing is horseshit.

1333
01:32:57.223 --> 01:32:58.656
Hello?

1334
01:33:00.493 --> 01:33:02.984
Man, this sucks.

1335
01:33:03.095 --> 01:33:04.926
Whoisitout there?

1336
01:33:08.133 --> 01:33:10.761
It's the Stifmeister, baby.

1337
01:33:10.870 --> 01:33:12.701
Is thatso?

1338
01:33:17.142 --> 01:33:19.474
Life's a bitch, isn't it?

1339
01:33:21.747 --> 01:33:25.046
It's all right.
You don't have to say anything.

1340
01:33:25.150 --> 01:33:27.550
I'm used to girls ignoring me.

1341
01:33:27.653 --> 01:33:29.553
Or making fun ofme.

1342
01:33:29.655 --> 01:33:31.680
"Come on, Sherman.
Be the Sherminator."

1343
01:33:33.392 --> 01:33:36.418
Like the movie.
How clever.

1344
01:33:36.529 --> 01:33:38.463
I get it, okay?

1345
01:33:40.232 --> 01:33:41.665
Maybe I am a geek.

1346
01:33:41.767 --> 01:33:44.258
Whatever.

1347
01:33:46.472 --> 01:33:49.441
Yes! Yes, you are!

1348
01:33:51.977 --> 01:33:53.535
All right.

1349
01:33:55.748 --> 01:33:59.445
I am the Sherminator.

1350
01:33:59.552 --> 01:34:03.010
A sophisticated sex robot
sent back through time...

1351
01:34:03.122 --> 01:34:05.613
to change the future
for one lucky lady.

1352
01:34:06.625 --> 01:34:08.616
I am lucky lady?

1353
01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:13.460
That's right, Nadia.
You've been targeted for Shermination.

1354
01:34:13.566 --> 01:34:16.194
Come with me
ifyou want to live.

1355
01:34:19.805 --> 01:34:20.472
Help!

1356
01:34:20.472 --> 01:34:21.063

Brilliant.
You found lesbians.

1365
01:35:16.362 --> 01:35:18.887
Good luck trying to break
through that force field.

1366
01:35:18.998 --> 01:35:22.297
- Lesbians?
- We never said that.

1367
01:35:28.374 --> 01:35:30.934

1368
01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:36.275
Oh, man.

to sleep with you chicks.

1370
01:35:41.353 --> 01:35:45.790
Okay? I'll grab
every guy's ass in this room.

It's true. I'll kiss everybody here.
Dudes, chicks, everybody.

1374
01:35:56.602 --> 01:36:00.368
Because I am comfortable
with my sexuality.

1375
01:36:00.472 --> 01:36:01.769
Oh, yeah.

1376
01:36:03.842 --> 01:36:06.310
At least have a drink
with the Stifmeister.

1377
01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:09.680
- All right.
- That's fair.

1378
01:36:11.517 --> 01:36:13.075
All right.

1379
01:36:15.688 --> 01:36:17.986
You truly are a Stifmeister.

1380
01:36:18.090 --> 01:36:22.186
- Welcome back to the party.

1381
01:36:22.294 --> 01:36:25.127
- Ladies, I am down with the funky shit.

1382
01:36:25.230 --> 01:36:27.528
One time at this party,
I was drinking champagne--

1383
01:36:30.703 --> 01:36:32.330
Thankyou. Thankyou.

1384
01:36:32.438 --> 01:36:35.771
Our next soloist

Petey?

1386
01:37:10.943 --> 01:37:13.138
This kid is killing me.

1389
01:37:18.984 --> 01:37:21.043
I'm a very special boy.

1390
01:37:37.603 --> 01:37:39.594
How's this
for a band camp story?

1391
01:37:50.916 --> 01:37:54.545
Come on, guys.
Let's hear it for Petey!

1392
01:38:23.816 --> 01:38:25.977

1394
01:39:12.564 --> 01:39:15.124
- Wanna dance?

We'll be back.
Come on now, baby.

1396
01:40:02.381 --> 01:40:04.650
You know, there's only one word
for that party.

1397
01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:05.514
You know, there's only one word
for that party.

1398
01:40:05.617 --> 01:40:07.812
- Bitchin'.
- Out ofcontrol.

1399
01:40:09.521 --> 01:40:11.490
Am I gonna have a hangover?
'Cause I want one.

1400
01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:11.717

'Cause I want one.

01:40:21.566 --> 01:40:23.193

1404
01:40:26.438 --> 01:40:29.305
This partywas crazy!
Look at my date! He's passed out!

1405
01:40:29.408 --> 01:40:31.808
- You drank him under the table.
- He couldn't hack it.

1406
01:41:10.882 --> 01:41:14.181
- Best summer ever, huh, fellas?
- Absolutely.

1407
01:41:14.286 --> 01:41:18.557

- You kiddin'? Things are great.

1408
01:41:18.757 --> 01:41:21.021
I have all the time in the world.

1409
01:41:21.126 --> 01:41:23.185
So, are we gonna
do this every summer?

1410
01:41:23.295 --> 01:41:25.593
- Hell, yeah, we are.
- Ofcourse we are, gentlemen.

1411
01:41:25.697 --> 01:41:27.255
Well, we're gonna try.

1412
01:41:38.677 --> 01:41:41.510
- That's a sweet car.

1413
01:41:47.519 --> 01:41:49.885
- Stifler's mom.
- Hey, Finchy.

1414
01:41:49.988 --> 01:41:51.922
How did you know I was here?

1415
01:41:52.024 --> 01:41:54.185
I called a couple ofweeks ago.

1416
01:41:54.292 --> 01:41:56.760
Didn't Steven tell you that
I was gonna drop by sometime?

1417
01:41:56.862 --> 01:41:59.592
I guess it slipped his mind.

1418
01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:03.061
What's your name?

1419
01:42:05.270 --> 01:42:06.464

1420
01:42:09.474 --> 01:42:11.738
Okay, well...

1421
01:42:11.843 --> 01:42:15.040
I've been thinking, and,
you know, I'm 1 9 years old.

1422
01:42:15.147 --> 01:42:19.277
There's a whole world out there.
I can't be obsessed with one woman.

1423
01:42:19.384 --> 01:42:23.150
-Just can't be.
- I'm glad you're learning, Finchy.

1424
01:42:24.656 --> 01:42:28.092
Good.

That was--

1434
01:43:00.959 --> 01:43:02.620
That was-- Someone was lost.

1435
01:43:02.727 --> 01:43:06.823
- Lookin' for the lake.
- Yeah, all turned around.

1436
01:43:06.932 --> 01:43:10.095
What a dumb ass.
The lake's right there.

1437
01:43:15.740 --> 01:43:19.471
Incredible.
