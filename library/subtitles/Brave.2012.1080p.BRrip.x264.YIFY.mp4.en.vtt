00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.879
Where are you?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.000
Come out! Come out!

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.900
Come on out!

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.850
I'm coming to get you!

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.000
Where are you, you little rascal, I'm coming to get you! Hm.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.608
Where is my little birthday girl, hm?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.400
I'm going to gobble her up, when I find her!

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.800
I'm going to eat you, om nom nom

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.500
Oh, Fergus! No weapons on the table!

00:01:55.501 --> 00:01:59.161
Can I shoot an arrow, can I, can I, can I? Please, can I?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.650
Not with that!

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:05.465
Why not use your very own!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.760
Happy birthday my wee darling!

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.200
Now, there's a good girl. Draw all the way back now to your cheek, that's right!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.599
Keep both eyes open...and...loose!

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:25.400
I missed.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:32.249
Go and fetch it then!

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:32.594
A bow, Fergus? She's a lady! Oh!

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:12.913
A will-o'-the-wisp!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.148
They are real!

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.800
Merida! Come on, sweetheart!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.032
We're leaving now!

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:36.452
I saw a wisp!

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.990
I saw a wisp.

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.900
A wisp?

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.542
You know, some say, that will-o'-the wisps lead you to your fate.

00:03:45.543 --> 00:03:47.764
Oh, aye, or an arrow!

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:52.846
Come on, let's be off before we see a dancing tattybogle or a giant having a jigger in the bluebells...

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.962
Your father doesn't believe in magic.

00:03:55.963 --> 00:03:58.378
Well, he should, 'cause it's true!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.505
Mor'du!

00:04:01.506 --> 00:04:02.550
Elinor, run!

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.032
Come on, you!

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.999
BRAVE

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.143
Some say, our destiny is tied to the land.

00:04:32.144 --> 00:04:34.915
As much a part of us as we are of it.

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.100
Others say, fate is vowen together like a cloth.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.706
So that one's destiny intertwines with many others.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.849
It's the one thing we search for, or fight to change.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.665
Some never find it.

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:06.198
But there are some, who are led.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:15.610
The story of how my father lost his leg to the demon bear Mor'du became legend.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.335
I became a sister, to three new brothers! The princes: Hamish, Hubert and Harris.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.869
Wee devils, more like.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.928
They'd get away with murder!

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.616
I can never get away with anything!

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.420
I'm the princess!

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.263
I'm the example!

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.400
I've got duties, responsibilities, expectations...

00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:46.608
My whole life is planned out!

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.100
Preparing for the day I'd become, well, my mother.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.146
She is in charge of every single day of my life.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:00.005
Hey Robin, jolly Robin, and thou shalt know of mine...

00:06:00.006 --> 00:06:01.100
Project!

00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:03.738
And thou shalt know of mine!

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:08.988
Enunciate, you must be understood from anywhere in the room! Or it's all for naught.

00:06:09.023 --> 00:06:10.613
This is all for naught.

00:06:10.614 --> 00:06:11.714
I heard that!

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.981
From the top!

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.978
A princess must be knowledgeable about her kingdom.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.718
She does nae doodle!

00:06:21.916 --> 00:06:23.594
That's a C, dear.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.308
A princess does not chortle!

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:34.950
Does nae stuff her gob!

00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:36.750
Rises early!

00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:37.692
Is compassionate.

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:39.053
Patient.

00:06:39.054 --> 00:06:39.922
Cautious!

00:06:39.923 --> 00:06:40.837
Clean.

00:06:40.838 --> 00:06:48.298
And, above all, a princess strives for, well, perfection!

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:56.177
But every once in a while there's a day when I don't have to be a princess.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.193
No lessons, no expectations, a day when anything can happen!

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.891
Day, I can change my fate!

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.084
I'm starving!

00:09:12.085 --> 00:09:14.702
You're hungry too, I guess?

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.897
Oats it is then.

00:09:26.423 --> 00:09:30.825
And then, out of nowhere, the biggest bear you've ever seen!

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:38.372
His hide littered with the weapons of fallen warriors, his face scarred, with one dead eye.

00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:40.210
I drew my sword and...

00:09:40.211 --> 00:09:44.047
Woosh! With one swipe his sword shattered

00:09:44.048 --> 00:09:50.006
and then chomp! Dad's leg was clean off! Down the monster's throat it went.

00:09:50.007 --> 00:09:52.977
Oh, that's my favourite part!

00:09:52.978 --> 00:09:56.410
Mor'du has never been seen since!

00:09:56.411 --> 00:10:02.268
And is roaming the wilds waiting his chance of revenge! Arrrgh!

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:06.889
Let him return. I'll finish what I'd guddled in the first place.

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:10.694
Merida, a princess does not place her weapons on the table

00:10:10.695 --> 00:10:11.943
Mom!

00:10:11.978 --> 00:10:13.526
It's just my bow!

00:10:13.527 --> 00:10:16.786
A princess should not have weapons in my opinion.

00:10:16.787 --> 00:10:21.392
Leave her be! Princess or not, learning to fight is essential.

00:10:21.393 --> 00:10:23.953
Mom, you'll never guess what I did today.

00:10:23.954 --> 00:10:24.628
Mhm?

00:10:24.629 --> 00:10:28.040
I climbed the Queen's Tooth and drank from the Fire Falls!

00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:33.392
Fire Falls? They say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:35.733
What did you do, dear?

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.118
Nothing, mom.

00:10:38.119 --> 00:10:39.214
Hungry, aren't we?

00:10:39.215 --> 00:10:39.954
Mom!

00:10:39.955 --> 00:10:41.184
You'll get dreadful gollywobbles!

00:10:41.185 --> 00:10:44.517
Oh Fergus! Will you look at your daughter's plate?

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:46.176
So what?

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:48.757
Don't let them lick...

00:10:48.758 --> 00:10:51.931
Boys, you're naughty! Don't just play with your haggis.

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.914
Oh, now, how'd you know you don't like it if you won't try it?

00:10:56.915 --> 00:11:01.868
It's just a wee sheep stomach! It's delicious! Mmm.

00:11:01.868 --> 00:11:02.701
Mylady.

00:11:02.736 --> 00:11:04.235
Thank you Maudie.

00:11:10.532 --> 00:11:13.859
Aha. From the lords Macintosh,  MacGuffin and Dingwall.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.877
Their responses, no doubt.

00:11:20.650 --> 00:11:25.996
Stay out of my food, you greedy mongrels! Chew on that, you manky dogs!

00:11:27.208 --> 00:11:27.908
Fergus?

00:11:30.336 --> 00:11:31.297
They've all accepted!

00:11:34.406 --> 00:11:35.493
Who's accepted what, mother?

00:11:36.394 --> 00:11:38.875
Boys, you are excused.

00:11:45.505 --> 00:11:48.777
What did I do now?

00:11:48.778 --> 00:11:51.299
Your father has something to discuss with you.

00:11:53.595 --> 00:11:54.095
Fergus?

00:12:01.466 --> 00:12:02.466
Merida.

00:12:05.848 --> 00:12:10.674
The lords are presenting their sons as suitors for your betrothal!

00:12:10.675 --> 00:12:11.353
What?

00:12:11.354 --> 00:12:13.569
The clans have accepted!

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:14.647
Dad!

00:12:14.648 --> 00:12:19.268
What? I...you....she....Elinor?

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:22.101
Honestly, Merida. I don't know why are you reacting this way.

00:12:22.102 --> 00:12:27.241
This year, each clan will present a suitor to compete in the games for your hand.

00:12:27.242 --> 00:12:29.504
I suppose a princess just does what she's told!

00:12:29.505 --> 00:12:31.672
A princess does not raise her voice!

00:12:32.833 --> 00:12:35.841
Merida, this is what you've been preparing for your whole life!

00:12:35.842 --> 00:12:39.688
No, it's what you've been preparing me for my whole life!

00:12:39.689 --> 00:12:41.156
I won't go through with it!

00:12:41.157 --> 00:12:42.622
You can't make me!

00:12:42.623 --> 00:12:43.471
Merida!

00:12:45.854 --> 00:12:46.537
Merida!

00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:52.325
Boys!

00:12:57.012 --> 00:12:57.260
Mother!

00:12:57.761 --> 00:12:58.896
Suitors!

00:12:59.854 --> 00:13:00.185
Marriage!

00:13:00.867 --> 00:13:03.253
Once, there was an ancient kingdom.

00:13:03.254 --> 00:13:04.761
Oh, mom!

00:13:06.161 --> 00:13:07.684
Ancient kingdom.

00:13:07.685 --> 00:13:09.185
Its name long forgotten.

00:13:10.293 --> 00:13:14.143
Ruled by a wise and fair king who was much beloved.

00:13:14.566 --> 00:13:19.264
And when he grew old, he divided the kingdom among his four sons,

00:13:19.265 --> 00:13:24.277
that they should be the pillars on which the peace of the land rested.

00:13:25.221 --> 00:13:30.206
But, the oldest prince wanted to rule the land for himself.

00:13:30.207 --> 00:13:38.335
He followed his own path and the kingdom fell to war and chaos and ruin.

00:13:38.336 --> 00:13:39.934
That's a nice story!

00:13:39.935 --> 00:13:42.824
It's not just a story, Merida.

00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:45.934
Legends are lessons, they ring with truths.

00:13:45.935 --> 00:13:47.492
Ah, mom!

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.501
I would advise you to make your peace with this.

00:13:49.502 --> 00:13:51.821
The clans are coming to present their suitors.

00:13:51.822 --> 00:13:53.401
It's not fair!

00:13:53.402 --> 00:13:56.637
Oh, Merida, it's marriage. It's not the end of the world.

00:14:05.579 --> 00:14:07.109
You're muttering.

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:08.297
I don't mutter.

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:12.176
Aye, you do, you mutter, lass. When something's troubling you.

00:14:12.177 --> 00:14:16.303
I blame you. The stubborness. It's entirely from your side of the family.

00:14:17.176 --> 00:14:19.249
I take it it all didn't go too well?

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.719
I don't know what to do.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:23.433
Speak to her, dear!

00:14:23.434 --> 00:14:26.658
I do speak to her! She just doesn't listen!

00:14:26.659 --> 00:14:28.743
Come on, now.

00:14:28.744 --> 00:14:31.814
Pretend I'm Merida. Speak to me. What would you say?

00:14:33.015 --> 00:14:35.066
Oh, I can't do this!

00:14:35.067 --> 00:14:37.365
Sure you can!

00:14:38.059 --> 00:14:39.850
There, there! That's my Queen.

00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:40.904
Right, here we go.

00:14:42.524 --> 00:14:45.885
I don't want to get married! I want to stay single and let my hair flow in the wind

00:14:45.886 --> 00:14:50.065
as I ride through the glen firing arrows into the sunset.

00:14:55.799 --> 00:15:01.404
Merida. All this work, all the time spent preparing you, schooling you,

00:15:01.405 --> 00:15:07.907
giving you everything we never had...I ask you, what do you expect us to do?

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:11.539
Call off the gathering! Would that kill them?

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:15.710
You're the Queen, you can just tell the lords, the princess is not ready for this.

00:15:15.711 --> 00:15:19.843
In fact, she might not ever be ready for this so that's that.

00:15:19.844 --> 00:15:24.144
Good day to you. We'll expect your declarations of war in the morning.

00:15:24.145 --> 00:15:30.275
I understand this must all seem unfair, even I had reservations when I faced betrothal.

00:15:30.276 --> 00:15:33.457
We can't just run away from who we are!

00:15:33.458 --> 00:15:36.077
I don't want my life to be over.

00:15:36.078 --> 00:15:37.822
I want my freedom!

00:15:37.823 --> 00:15:41.141
But are you willing to pay the price your freedom will cost?

00:15:41.142 --> 00:15:43.123
I'm not doing any of this to hurt you.

00:15:43.124 --> 00:15:48.342
If you could just try to see what I do, I do out of love.

00:15:48.343 --> 00:15:50.373
But it's my life, it's...

00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:53.907
I'm just not ready.

00:15:53.908 --> 00:15:56.109
I think you'd see, if you could just...

00:15:56.110 --> 00:15:59.256
I think I could make you understand if you would just...

00:15:59.257 --> 00:15:59.588
...listen!

00:15:59.689 --> 00:16:00.625
...listen!

00:16:03.866 --> 00:16:07.009
I swear, Angus, this isn't going to happen!

00:16:08.142 --> 00:16:09.435
Not if I have any say in it.

00:16:26.108 --> 00:16:27.778
MacGuffin!

00:16:32.552 --> 00:16:34.009
Dingwall!

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:37.683
Macintosh!

00:16:52.070 --> 00:16:55.479
You look absolutely beautiful!

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:57.216
I can't breathe!

00:16:57.217 --> 00:16:59.039
Oh, shush. Give us a turn.

00:17:01.392 --> 00:17:04.479
I can't move. It's too tight!

00:17:06.583 --> 00:17:07.810
It's perfect!

00:17:20.078 --> 00:17:20.705
Merida...

00:17:21.999 --> 00:17:22.729
Mom?

00:17:25.627 --> 00:17:27.737
Just...

00:17:30.219 --> 00:17:31.674
...remeber to smile.

00:17:47.082 --> 00:17:47.707
Oy, they're coming!

00:17:47.865 --> 00:17:50.874
Places everyone! Places!

00:18:07.098 --> 00:18:09.626
I look fine, woman. Leave me be!

00:18:09.627 --> 00:18:10.627
???

00:18:33.596 --> 00:18:33.896
Oy!

00:18:46.092 --> 00:18:51.453
So, here we are. The four clans.

00:18:52.465 --> 00:18:53.101
Gathering.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:56.302
For...

00:18:56.303 --> 00:18:59.610
...the presentations of the suitors.

00:19:02.796 --> 00:19:02.796
Clan Macintosh.

00:19:05.556 --> 00:19:10.685
Your Majesty, I present my heir and sire who defended our land

00:19:10.686 --> 00:19:19.010
from the Northern invaders and with his own sword stabbed bloody, vanquished a thousand foes!

00:19:22.997 --> 00:19:23.697
Clan MacGuffin.

00:19:26.621 --> 00:19:30.981
Good Majesty. I present my eldest son.

00:19:30.982 --> 00:19:38.388
Who scuttled Viking longships and with his bare hands vanquished two thousand foes.

00:19:43.996 --> 00:19:44.937
Clan Dingwall.

00:19:48.017 --> 00:19:56.182
I present my only son who was besieged by ten thousand Romans,

00:19:56.183 --> 00:20:00.755
and he took out a whole armada singlehandedly.

00:20:00.756 --> 00:20:03.169
With one arm, he was...

00:20:03.919 --> 00:20:06.428
With one arm, he was steering the ship

00:20:06.429 --> 00:20:12.831
and with the other, he held his mighty sword and struck down a whole attacking fleet.

00:20:12.832 --> 00:20:13.361
Lies!

00:20:13.362 --> 00:20:14.123
What?

00:20:14.424 --> 00:20:16.884
I heard that! Come on, say it to my face!

00:20:17.519 --> 00:20:22.438
Or are you scared simpering jackanapes, 'fraid to muss your pretty hair?

00:20:22.439 --> 00:20:24.412
At least we have hair!

00:20:24.413 --> 00:20:26.305
And all our teeth!

00:20:26.306 --> 00:20:28.534
(thick accent) If he was a wee bit closer, I could lob a caber at him, ye ken.

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:33.870
And we don't hide under bridges, you grumpy old troll!

00:20:37.787 --> 00:20:41.772
You want a laugh, eh? Wee Dingwall!

00:20:56.956 --> 00:20:59.811
At him, at him! That's the way to...

00:21:01.954 --> 00:21:03.019
All right.

00:21:04.939 --> 00:21:06.687
Shut it!

00:21:08.273 --> 00:21:11.344
Now, that's all done.

00:21:11.345 --> 00:21:14.910
You've had your go at each other, show a little decorum!

00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:17.598
And no more fighting!

00:22:00.389 --> 00:22:01.860
I didn't start it was he...

00:22:02.313 --> 00:22:06.193
Mylady Queen, I feel terrible, my humblest apologies.
Sorry....We meant no disrespect.

00:22:06.228 --> 00:22:09.440
Sorry, love, I didn't, but...Yes, dear.

00:22:10.841 --> 00:22:12.390
Now, where were we.

00:22:12.391 --> 00:22:18.677
Ah, yes. In accordance with our laws, by the rights of our heritage

00:22:18.678 --> 00:22:24.855
only the firstborn of each of the great leaders may be presented as champion.

00:22:24.856 --> 00:22:25.336
Firstborn?

00:22:25.337 --> 00:22:29.865
And thus compete for the hand of the princess of DunBroch.

00:22:30.949 --> 00:22:37.709
To win the fair maiden, they must prove their worth by feats of strength or arms in the games.

00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:42.438
It is customary that the challenge be determined by the princess herself.

00:22:42.439 --> 00:22:44.151
Archery, archery!

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:50.883
I choose...archery.

00:22:51.521 --> 00:22:53.720
Let the games begin!

00:23:17.663 --> 00:23:18.463
Pull!

00:23:44.544 --> 00:23:46.849
I have told  you, you're not allowed...

00:24:09.271 --> 00:24:10.337
It's time!

00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:14.523
Archers, to your marks!

00:24:14.524 --> 00:24:16.439
Aye, archers to your marks!

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:19.409
And may the lucky arrow find its target.

00:24:29.422 --> 00:24:31.169
Oy, get on with it!

00:24:42.556 --> 00:24:44.894
I bet he wishes he was tossing cabers.

00:24:44.895 --> 00:24:46.469
Or holding up bridges.

00:24:53.731 --> 00:24:56.247
Noooo!

00:24:56.248 --> 00:24:59.048
At least you hit the target, son!

00:25:00.533 --> 00:25:02.231
Oh, that's attractive.

00:25:05.266 --> 00:25:06.699
I've got it!

00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:07.945
Good arm.

00:25:07.946 --> 00:25:11.357
And such lovely flowing locks!

00:25:11.358 --> 00:25:11.847
Fergus!

00:25:11.848 --> 00:25:12.588
What?

00:25:22.263 --> 00:25:23.850
Oh, wee lamb!

00:25:29.453 --> 00:25:32.188
Oh, come on, shoot, boy!

00:25:34.813 --> 00:25:36.246
Well done!

00:25:40.345 --> 00:25:41.676
Feast your eyes!

00:25:41.977 --> 00:25:44.078
That's my boy!

00:25:46.533 --> 00:25:49.762
Well, that's just grand now, isn't it?

00:25:49.763 --> 00:25:52.552
Guess who's coming to dinner.

00:25:52.553 --> 00:25:53.151
Fergus!

00:25:53.152 --> 00:25:55.637
By the way, hope you don't mind being called lade Ding...

00:26:03.658 --> 00:26:09.001
I am Merida, firstborn descendant of clan DunBroch.

00:26:09.002 --> 00:26:12.766
And I'll be shooting for my own hand!

00:26:14.396 --> 00:26:16.336
What are you doing?

00:26:19.555 --> 00:26:20.348
Merida!

00:26:22.015 --> 00:26:23.735
Curse this dress!

00:26:30.831 --> 00:26:32.376
Merida! Stop this!

00:26:36.884 --> 00:26:38.907
Don't you dare loose another arrow!

00:26:48.804 --> 00:26:51.307
Merida! I forbid it!

00:27:22.351 --> 00:27:24.777
I've just about had enough of you, lass!

00:27:24.778 --> 00:27:26.173
You're the one that wants me to...

00:27:26.174 --> 00:27:28.524
You've embarrassed them. You've embarrassed me.

00:27:28.525 --> 00:27:29.472
I followed the rules!

00:27:29.473 --> 00:27:30.210
You don't know what you've done!

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:31.945
I don't care...

00:27:31.946 --> 00:27:33.542
There'll be fire and swords if it's not set right.

00:27:33.543 --> 00:27:35.142
Just listen!

00:27:35.143 --> 00:27:38.014
I am the Queen! You listen to me!

00:27:38.015 --> 00:27:40.384
Oh, this is so unfair!

00:27:40.685 --> 00:27:42.270
Unfair?

00:27:42.271 --> 00:27:43.702
You're never there for me.

00:27:43.703 --> 00:27:46.552
This whole marriage is what you want!

00:27:46.553 --> 00:27:48.598
Do you ever bother to ask what I want?

00:27:48.599 --> 00:27:53.365
No! You walk around telling me what to do, what not to do,

00:27:53.366 --> 00:27:55.286
trying to make me feel like you.

00:27:55.287 --> 00:27:58.078
Well, I'm not going to be like you!

00:27:58.079 --> 00:27:59.655
Oh, you're acting like a child.

00:27:59.656 --> 00:28:04.420
And you're a beast! That's what you are!

00:28:04.421 --> 00:28:04.664
Merida!

00:28:04.665 --> 00:28:06.661
I'll never be like you!

00:28:06.662 --> 00:28:07.362
No, stop that!

00:28:07.363 --> 00:28:09.745
I'd rather die than be like you!

00:28:14.768 --> 00:28:20.130
Merida, you are a princess, I expect you to act like one!

00:28:28.707 --> 00:28:29.454
Merida!

00:28:29.655 --> 00:28:32.535
Merida!

00:28:34.118 --> 00:28:35.030
Oh, dear!

00:28:40.009 --> 00:28:42.269
Oh, no. What've I done.

00:29:20.309 --> 00:29:20.939
Angus!

00:30:07.236 --> 00:30:08.156
Come on, Angus!

00:30:10.676 --> 00:30:11.076
Angus!

00:31:00.048 --> 00:31:01.946
Why would the wisps lead me here?

00:31:28.026 --> 00:31:31.819
Oh, look around. You holler if you see anything you like.

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.199
Everything is half off.

00:31:40.227 --> 00:31:41.126
Who are you?

00:31:41.127 --> 00:31:43.120
Just a humble woodcarver.

00:31:44.214 --> 00:31:46.202
I don't understand.

00:31:47.427 --> 00:31:48.417
See anything you like?

00:31:49.866 --> 00:31:53.789
Perhaps a touch of whimsy to brighten any dank chamber.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:57.040
But, the will-o'-the-wisps! They lead...

00:31:57.041 --> 00:32:01.202
Oh, this is one of a kind! I'll make you a deal for this rare prize.

00:32:03.021 --> 00:32:03.898
Your broom!

00:32:05.521 --> 00:32:07.392
It was sweeping by itself!

00:32:07.393 --> 00:32:08.084
That's ridiculous.

00:32:08.085 --> 00:32:11.432
Wood cannae be imbued with magical properties.

00:32:11.433 --> 00:32:14.120
I should know, I'm a wi...whittler!

00:32:15.202 --> 00:32:16.862
Of wood.

00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:20.055
How about this conversation starter?

00:32:20.056 --> 00:32:22.211
It's made of yew wood.

00:32:22.212 --> 00:32:23.596
Half a stone.

00:32:23.897 --> 00:32:26.978
Oh, ah ah, that's daft.

00:32:28.047 --> 00:32:29.419
Staring is rude!

00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:31.966
The crow... crow's talking!

00:32:31.967 --> 00:32:33.085
That's not all I can do. La la la la.

00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:43.048
You're a witch!

00:32:43.049 --> 00:32:44.408
Woodcarver!

00:32:44.409 --> 00:32:46.702
That's why the wisps led me here!

00:32:46.703 --> 00:32:47.986
Woodcarver!

00:32:47.987 --> 00:32:49.583
You'll change my fate!

00:32:49.584 --> 00:32:50.625
WOODCARVER!

00:32:50.626 --> 00:32:52.234
You see, it's my mother...

00:32:52.235 --> 00:32:55.427
I'm not a witch! Too many unsatisfied customers.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:01.498
If you're not going to buy anything, get out!

00:33:02.877 --> 00:33:04.535
No, the wisps led me here!

00:33:04.536 --> 00:33:06.279
I don't care!

00:33:07.429 --> 00:33:10.043
Get out! Shoo! Get! Begone with you!

00:33:10.078 --> 00:33:11.522
I'll buy it all!

00:33:11.657 --> 00:33:12.859
What, what was that?

00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:14.864
Every carving.

00:33:17.512 --> 00:33:21.087
And how are you going to pay for that, sweetie?

00:33:21.088 --> 00:33:22.128
With this.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.195
Oh my, that's lovely, that is.

00:33:29.196 --> 00:33:30.634
That will set us up for months!

00:33:34.185 --> 00:33:39.372
Every carving and one spell.

00:33:40.565 --> 00:33:43.428
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

00:33:43.629 --> 00:33:46.873
I want a spell to change my mom.

00:33:46.874 --> 00:33:48.822
That'll change my fate.

00:33:50.443 --> 00:33:50.994
Done!

00:33:53.084 --> 00:33:53.700
Where are you going?

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.120
There.

00:33:57.133 --> 00:33:58.010
What're you doing?

00:33:59.037 --> 00:34:02.264
You never conjure where you carve, very important.

00:34:06.928 --> 00:34:09.291
Last time I did this was for a prince.

00:34:10.796 --> 00:34:11.927
Easy on the eyes.

00:34:13.635 --> 00:34:15.960
He demanded I give him the strength of ten men.

00:34:16.161 --> 00:34:20.315
And he gave me this for a spell.

00:34:20.855 --> 00:34:22.507
A spell that would change his fate.

00:34:24.538 --> 00:34:26.181
And did he get what he was after?

00:34:26.182 --> 00:34:31.408
Ohoho, yes. I made off with an especially atractive mahogany cheeseboard.

00:34:31.409 --> 00:34:33.765
Now, what do I need?

00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:46.179
That'll do.

00:35:04.328 --> 00:35:08.052
And, now, let's see.

00:35:08.053 --> 00:35:10.394
What have we here?

00:35:19.387 --> 00:35:20.665
A cake?

00:35:20.666 --> 00:35:21.740
You don't want it?

00:35:21.741 --> 00:35:23.375
Yes, I want it!

00:35:24.197 --> 00:35:30.181
You're sure, if I give this to my mom, it will change my fate?

00:35:30.182 --> 00:35:32.922
Ohh, trust me.

00:35:33.666 --> 00:35:35.564
It'll do the trick, dearie.

00:35:36.043 --> 00:35:40.370
Expect delivery of your purchase within a fortnight.

00:35:43.655 --> 00:35:45.939
What was that thing about the spell?

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:53.094
Did you say something...about...the...spell?

00:36:23.194 --> 00:36:24.311
Merida!

00:36:24.312 --> 00:36:24.811
Mom!

00:36:24.812 --> 00:36:27.143
Oh...eh...I...eh...

00:36:27.144 --> 00:36:29.131
Oh, I've been worried sick!

00:36:29.132 --> 00:36:30.497
You, you were?

00:36:30.498 --> 00:36:33.433
I didn't know where you've gone or when you'd come back!

00:36:33.434 --> 00:36:36.286
I didn't know what to think! Oh, look at your dress!

00:36:37.192 --> 00:36:38.415
Angus threw me.

00:36:38.416 --> 00:36:39.801
But I'm not hurt!

00:36:39.802 --> 00:36:41.856
Well, you're home now.

00:36:41.857 --> 00:36:43.745
So that's the end of it.

00:36:44.528 --> 00:36:45.395
Honestly?

00:36:45.396 --> 00:36:47.747
I've pacified the lords for now.

00:36:48.048 --> 00:36:51.033
Your father's out there "entertaining" them.

00:36:51.034 --> 00:36:54.341
Come taste my blade you manky bear for gobbling up my leg!

00:36:54.842 --> 00:36:58.533
I'll hunt you, then I'll skin you, hang your noggin on a peg!

00:37:01.216 --> 00:37:04.719
Of course, we both know a decision still has to be made.

00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:10.218
What's this?

00:37:10.219 --> 00:37:15.021
It's a peace offering. I made it. For you. Special.

00:37:15.056 --> 00:37:17.385
You made this for me?

00:37:24.552 --> 00:37:26.481
Interesting flavour.

00:37:26.482 --> 00:37:27.984
How do you feel?

00:37:28.485 --> 00:37:29.612
What is that?

00:37:29.613 --> 00:37:30.717
Different?

00:37:31.287 --> 00:37:34.729
Tart and gamey...

00:37:34.730 --> 00:37:38.661
Have you changed your mind at all about the marriage and all that?

00:37:40.069 --> 00:37:40.866
Oh, better.

00:37:41.061 --> 00:37:47.098
Now, why don't we go upstairs to the lords and put this whole kerfuffle to rest, hm?

00:37:55.844 --> 00:37:56.448
Mother?

00:37:56.649 --> 00:38:01.103
I'm woozy suddenly. Oh, my head's spinning like a top!

00:38:01.304 --> 00:38:01.802
Mom!

00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:05.337
Oh, suddenly I'm not so well.

00:38:06.119 --> 00:38:09.154
How do you feel about the marriage now?

00:38:09.155 --> 00:38:10.087
Merida!

00:38:11.058 --> 00:38:12.224
Just take me to my room.

00:38:15.084 --> 00:38:16.633
To the left, that's good, that's good.

00:38:16.634 --> 00:38:18.281
A wee bit to the left, that's good.

00:38:18.316 --> 00:38:23.240
It's good enough. Now clean out of there boys, I don't want you to spoil my shot.

00:38:24.142 --> 00:38:25.240
Mylady Queen!

00:38:25.679 --> 00:38:28.049
We've been waiting patiently.

00:38:28.133 --> 00:38:32.376
My lords, I am out of sorts at the moment

00:38:32.677 --> 00:38:37.240
but you shall have your answer.

00:38:39.008 --> 00:38:40.192
Presently.

00:38:40.596 --> 00:38:43.678
Now, if you'll excuse us.

00:38:45.862 --> 00:38:48.324
Elinor, look! It's Mor'du!

00:38:50.544 --> 00:38:52.481
Elinor! Are you all right, dear?

00:38:52.482 --> 00:38:56.343
Fine, I'm fine. Go back to avenging your leg!

00:38:57.050 --> 00:38:58.659
Aye, you heard her lads.

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:03.355
I dream about the perfect way to make this devil die.

00:39:06.856 --> 00:39:10.529
Just take all the time you need getting yourself right, mom.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:14.837
And maybe in a bit you might have something new to say on the marriage?

00:39:14.838 --> 00:39:17.186
What was in that cake?

00:39:18.031 --> 00:39:18.963
Cake?

00:39:20.864 --> 00:39:22.104
Mom?

00:39:22.247 --> 00:39:24.965
So I'll just tell them the wedding's off then.

00:39:29.759 --> 00:39:30.486
Mom?

00:39:58.793 --> 00:40:00.375
Bear!

00:40:34.456 --> 00:40:35.698
Mom?

00:40:37.810 --> 00:40:40.752
You're...you're a bear!

00:40:42.747 --> 00:40:44.028
Why a bear?

00:40:45.296 --> 00:40:48.345
That's scaffy witch gave me a gammy spell!

00:40:50.404 --> 00:40:52.049
It's not my fault!

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:54.012
I didn't ask her to change you into a bear.

00:40:54.013 --> 00:40:59.286
I just wanted her to change...you.

00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.082
Shh, did you hear that?

00:41:07.478 --> 00:41:09.423
Something's not right.

00:41:12.720 --> 00:41:14.367
There's no point in having a go at me.

00:41:14.668 --> 00:41:16.191
The witch is to blame.

00:41:16.492 --> 00:41:17.841
Goggly old hag!

00:41:19.358 --> 00:41:21.079
Eyes all over the place.

00:41:21.380 --> 00:41:24.178
God. It's unbelievable!

00:41:24.679 --> 00:41:28.416
How I'm going to fix this.

00:41:34.827 --> 00:41:36.100
Everybody, follow me!

00:41:37.665 --> 00:41:39.169
And you keep a sharp eye!

00:41:40.917 --> 00:41:43.352
Here we go. Another hunt through the castle.

00:41:43.353 --> 00:41:45.084
We haven't even had a dessert yet.

00:41:45.164 --> 00:41:49.411
(unintelligible Doric accent)

00:41:51.112 --> 00:41:52.873
I have no idea.

00:41:53.412 --> 00:41:56.173
Mom, you can't go out there!

00:41:57.500 --> 00:41:58.292
Mom!

00:41:58.693 --> 00:42:00.029
Wait!

00:42:01.307 --> 00:42:02.578
What're you doing?

00:42:03.102 --> 00:42:04.013
Dad!

00:42:04.014 --> 00:42:05.471
The Bear King?

00:42:05.472 --> 00:42:07.531
If he so much as sees you, you're dead!

00:42:07.584 --> 00:42:11.117
Another one of your entertainments. Where is the end.

00:42:12.154 --> 00:42:16.094
Oh, and just what exactly are we after, my liege?

00:42:16.129 --> 00:42:19.452
Best to humour him. He is, after all, the king.

00:42:23.082 --> 00:42:25.722
He is like a hound with that nose of his.

00:42:27.057 --> 00:42:30.801
Mom! Wait! We have to...

00:42:31.521 --> 00:42:32.595
Follow me!

00:42:33.288 --> 00:42:34.394
Stop!

00:42:34.734 --> 00:42:36.143
Stop!

00:42:38.849 --> 00:42:41.265
You're covered with fur!

00:42:41.266 --> 00:42:42.741
You're not naked!

00:42:42.742 --> 00:42:45.414
It's not like anyone's gonna see you!

00:42:52.767 --> 00:42:54.024
Now you've done it!

00:42:56.460 --> 00:42:57.432
Maudie!

00:42:58.834 --> 00:43:00.865
Just calm down, lass. What is it?

00:43:02.276 --> 00:43:03.602
Spit it out, Maudie!

00:43:03.754 --> 00:43:05.062
A BEAR!

00:43:05.063 --> 00:43:06.037
I knew it!

00:43:08.029 --> 00:43:09.517
Would you just listen to me!

00:43:09.518 --> 00:43:12.159
We can't go this way. You'll be seen!

00:43:12.902 --> 00:43:14.145
Quick! This way!

00:43:16.828 --> 00:43:17.528
Mom?

00:43:33.516 --> 00:43:34.315
Mom?

00:43:53.884 --> 00:43:56.811
A witch turned mom into a bear. It's not my fault.

00:43:56.812 --> 00:43:59.360
We've got to get out of the castle. I need your help.

00:44:00.957 --> 00:44:05.114
All right. You can have my desserts for two...three weeks!

00:44:06.831 --> 00:44:09.094
OK, fine. A year.

00:44:14.890 --> 00:44:15.909
Did you hear that?

00:44:24.301 --> 00:44:25.534
There he goes!

00:44:38.041 --> 00:44:38.776
There he goes!

00:44:52.585 --> 00:44:53.784
Come on, mom!

00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:59.972
Do you think we should lay a trap?

00:44:59.973 --> 00:45:01.785
Try shutting yours!

00:45:05.261 --> 00:45:05.873
There he is!

00:45:19.652 --> 00:45:22.238
I'm sure it went this way.

00:45:22.985 --> 00:45:24.818
It must've sprouted wings!

00:45:24.819 --> 00:45:28.284
It was carried away by a giant birdie.

00:45:28.285 --> 00:45:29.366
A dragon, perhaps.

00:45:29.367 --> 00:45:32.059
Bear in that castle. Doesn't make sense.

00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:34.777
It cannae open doors. It's got big giant paws.

00:45:35.158 --> 00:45:36.798
Let's just get inside.

00:45:38.833 --> 00:45:40.355
It's locked.

00:45:40.356 --> 00:45:41.636
Dingwall was the last up.

00:45:41.637 --> 00:45:43.216
I propped it open with a stick.

00:45:49.999 --> 00:45:53.700
What'd you see Maudie? Spit it out, Maudie!

00:45:54.323 --> 00:45:57.535
Oh, for goodness' sakes, Maudie, would you get a grip?

00:46:05.224 --> 00:46:06.585
Come on, mom. Quick.

00:46:08.267 --> 00:46:09.167
Shhh!

00:46:27.572 --> 00:46:29.772
They'll be fine, won't you boys?

00:46:30.811 --> 00:46:32.611
Mom, we've got to hurry!

00:46:33.363 --> 00:46:34.836
Now, I'll be back soon.

00:46:34.837 --> 00:46:38.892
Go on and help yourself to anything you want, as a reward.

00:46:56.132 --> 00:46:57.534
Right.

00:47:03.628 --> 00:47:06.802
Oh, where are these wisps?

00:47:07.072 --> 00:47:08.548
Come out, wisps!

00:47:09.468 --> 00:47:10.432
Come on out!

00:47:11.868 --> 00:47:14.640
Lead me to the witch's cottage!

00:47:15.857 --> 00:47:16.913
I'm here!

00:47:18.875 --> 00:47:21.809
Fine! Don't come out now that my mom's watching.

00:47:23.964 --> 00:47:25.838
I was standing right here!

00:47:25.839 --> 00:47:28.288
And the wisp appeared right there!

00:47:28.289 --> 00:47:32.007
Then a whole trail of them led me off into the forest.

00:47:34.212 --> 00:47:34.996
???

00:47:48.843 --> 00:47:51.009
Oh, mom! I know this place.

00:47:51.768 --> 00:47:55.678
The witch's cottage...is this way!

00:47:55.679 --> 00:47:56.970
Come on! Hurry!

00:48:07.258 --> 00:48:09.990
I can't believe it! I found it!

00:48:14.593 --> 00:48:17.909
No! She was here.

00:48:18.830 --> 00:48:21.486
No, really. She was just here.

00:48:23.469 --> 00:48:25.124
Oh, wait.

00:48:29.245 --> 00:48:34.542
No..no...no, no, no!

00:48:59.868 --> 00:49:05.957
Welcome to the Crafty Carver, home of bear-themed carvings and novelties.

00:49:05.958 --> 00:49:08.714
I am completely out of stock at this time.

00:49:08.715 --> 00:49:14.045
But if you'd like to inquire about portraits or wedding cake toppers

00:49:14.046 --> 00:49:16.425
pour vial one into the cauldron.

00:49:16.426 --> 00:49:19.502
If you'd like a menu in Gaelic, vial two.

00:49:19.537 --> 00:49:22.158
If you're that red-haired lass, vial three.

00:49:22.159 --> 00:49:24.440
To speak with a live homunculus...

00:49:25.307 --> 00:49:29.548
Princess! I'm off to the Wickerman festival in Stoneham

00:49:29.549 --> 00:49:30.997
and I won't be back till spring.

00:49:30.998 --> 00:49:34.871
There's one bit I forgot to tell you about the spell.

00:49:34.872 --> 00:49:39.043
By the second sunrise, your spell will be permanent.

00:49:39.444 --> 00:49:43.032
Unless you remember these words:

00:49:44.233 --> 00:49:52.143
"Fate be changed. Look inside, mend the bond torn by pride."

00:49:53.044 --> 00:49:56.501
Fate be changed, mend the bond. What does that mean?

00:49:56.889 --> 00:49:58.211
One more time!

00:49:58.425 --> 00:50:06.696
"Fate be changed. Look inside, mend the bond torn by pride."

00:50:06.697 --> 00:50:12.118
That's it. Ta ta! Oh, and thank you for shopping at the Crafty Carver!

00:50:12.119 --> 00:50:14.733
No! Where'd you go?

00:50:14.734 --> 00:50:17.158
Welcome to the Crafty Carver!

00:50:17.159 --> 00:50:17.736
What?

00:50:20.316 --> 00:50:22.443
Maybe there's a bit about spells, or...

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:24.910
...vials...

00:50:24.911 --> 00:50:35.165
...I'm off to the Wickerman...clock..I said...Have a lovely day!

00:51:11.502 --> 00:51:14.073
We'll sort it out tomorrow.

00:52:02.721 --> 00:52:05.611
My brave wee lassie, I'm here.

00:52:05.612 --> 00:52:08.960
I'll always be right here.

00:52:31.887 --> 00:52:34.007
Ehm, good morning?

00:52:35.572 --> 00:52:39.694
So....what's all this supposed to be?

00:52:45.270 --> 00:52:45.753
What?

00:52:53.726 --> 00:52:55.732
Sorry, I don't speak bear.

00:53:16.712 --> 00:53:18.926
Find those by the creek, didn't you?

00:53:19.127 --> 00:53:21.226
They're Nightshade berries.

00:53:23.835 --> 00:53:24.990
They're poisonous.

00:53:33.398 --> 00:53:37.112
Where did you get this water? It has worms!

00:53:48.334 --> 00:53:49.742
Come on!

00:53:58.662 --> 00:53:59.971
Breakfast!

00:54:01.283 --> 00:54:06.478
Oh, wait. A princess should not have weapons, in your opinion.

00:54:08.137 --> 00:54:09.975
There you go.

00:54:11.542 --> 00:54:12.168
Go on!

00:54:15.057 --> 00:54:18.462
How do you know you don't like it if you won't try it?

00:56:28.799 --> 00:56:30.489
Where're you going?

00:56:41.822 --> 00:56:42.422
Mom!

00:56:42.923 --> 00:56:43.908
Come back!

00:56:57.189 --> 00:57:00.125
Mom, is that you?

00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.872
Mom?

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:13.846
You changed.

00:57:14.262 --> 00:57:15.543
Like you were a...

00:57:16.372 --> 00:57:20.728
I mean, like you were a bear on the inside.

00:57:29.665 --> 00:57:31.328
A wisp!

00:57:31.889 --> 00:57:32.589
Mom!

00:57:34.037 --> 00:57:35.209
Stop it!

00:57:37.143 --> 00:57:38.831
Mom, no!

00:57:41.308 --> 00:57:41.908
Mom!

00:57:48.012 --> 00:57:50.205
Oh, jings crivvens help ma boab!

00:57:50.874 --> 00:57:56.284
Mom, I know you're scared. You're tired, you don't understand.

00:57:56.285 --> 00:57:59.065
But we've got to keep our heads.

00:57:59.066 --> 00:58:02.131
Just calm down.

00:58:02.432 --> 00:58:03.432
Listen.

00:58:33.002 --> 00:58:34.472
They'll show us the way.

00:59:03.009 --> 00:59:05.553
Mom! Look!

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.545
Why did the wisps bring us here?

00:59:44.071 --> 00:59:46.810
Whoever they were, they've been gone for a long, long time.

00:59:53.803 --> 00:59:56.835
Fine, mom. Just fine.

01:00:06.907 --> 01:00:10.796
It's a....a throne room.

01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:15.763
You suppose this could've been the kingdom in that story you were telling me?

01:00:16.919 --> 01:00:18.465
The one with the princes?

01:00:22.403 --> 01:00:23.004
One...

01:00:23.813 --> 01:00:25.081
...two...

01:00:26.017 --> 01:00:26.853
...three...

01:00:26.954 --> 01:00:27.854
...four!

01:00:29.053 --> 01:00:30.521
The oldest.

01:00:33.492 --> 01:00:35.980
Split, like the tapestry!

01:00:41.122 --> 01:00:44.741
The spell! It's happened before.

01:00:49.246 --> 01:00:51.491
Strength of ten men.

01:00:53.046 --> 01:00:55.396
Fate be changed.

01:00:57.773 --> 01:00:59.653
Changed his fate.

01:01:01.895 --> 01:01:02.781
Oh, no.

01:01:03.588 --> 01:01:05.090
The prince became...

01:01:11.089 --> 01:01:12.447
Mor'du!

01:02:18.537 --> 01:02:21.145
Mom, we need to get back to the castle!

01:02:22.018 --> 01:02:24.891
If we don't hurry, you'll become like Mor'du!

01:02:24.892 --> 01:02:29.148
A bear, a real bear. Forever!

01:02:30.439 --> 01:02:32.999
Mend the bond torn by pride.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.982
The witch gave us the answer.

01:02:35.183 --> 01:02:36.871
The tapestry!

01:02:46.702 --> 01:02:49.562
Mom! Do you have a better idea?

01:03:08.106 --> 01:03:09.075
That'll do.

01:03:22.991 --> 01:03:27.732
No more talk, no more traditions, we settle this now!

01:03:27.733 --> 01:03:28.834
You're the king!

01:03:28.869 --> 01:03:32.477
You decide which one of our sons your daughter will marry.

01:03:32.478 --> 01:03:35.506
None of your sons are fit to marry my daughter!

01:03:35.507 --> 01:03:37.897
Then our alliance is over!

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:39.492
This means war!

01:03:44.069 --> 01:03:45.120
Gonna murder each other!

01:03:45.121 --> 01:03:47.729
You've got to stop them before it's too late!

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.664
I know, I know!

01:03:51.665 --> 01:03:54.481
But how do we get you through there and up to the tapestry

01:03:54.482 --> 01:03:56.413
with the lot of them boiling over like that?

01:04:15.578 --> 01:04:17.377
What're you doing, lass?

01:04:17.378 --> 01:04:19.162
It's all right, dad.

01:04:20.048 --> 01:04:23.846
I..ehm..I have...

01:04:25.709 --> 01:04:28.702
Well, you see...I...

01:04:28.703 --> 01:04:31.307
I have been in conference with the Queen.

01:04:31.308 --> 01:04:32.540
Is that so?

01:04:32.541 --> 01:04:34.300
Aye, it is.

01:04:34.301 --> 01:04:35.387
Well, where is she, then?

01:04:35.388 --> 01:04:36.593
She...

01:04:36.594 --> 01:04:38.712
How do we know that this isn't some trick?

01:04:38.713 --> 01:04:39.876
I'd never...

01:04:39.877 --> 01:04:41.118
This is highly irregular!

01:04:41.119 --> 01:04:42.572
What're you playing at? Where is the Queen?

01:04:42.573 --> 01:04:45.102
We'll not stand for any more of this chiggery pie!

01:04:45.103 --> 01:04:46.844
That's right. Let's see her.

01:04:46.845 --> 01:04:48.091
SHUT IT!

01:04:52.066 --> 01:04:55.274
Well, I....

01:05:04.230 --> 01:05:08.073
Once, there was an ancient kingdom.

01:05:08.074 --> 01:05:08.928
What is this?

01:05:09.856 --> 01:05:12.519
That kingdom fell into war.

01:05:13.293 --> 01:05:15.581
And chaos, and ruin.

01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:18.764
Oh, we've all heard that tale. Lost kingdom.

01:05:18.765 --> 01:05:19.966
Aye, but it's true!

01:05:19.967 --> 01:05:23.896
I know now how one selfish act can turn the fate of a kingdom.

01:05:23.897 --> 01:05:25.579
Nah, it's just a legend.

01:05:25.580 --> 01:05:29.565
Legends are lessons. They ring with truths.

01:05:30.957 --> 01:05:34.886
Our kingdom is young. Our stories are not yet legends.

01:05:35.187 --> 01:05:38.079
But in them are bonds we struck.

01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.391
Our clans were once enemies.

01:05:40.592 --> 01:05:43.758
But when invaders threatened us from the sea,

01:05:43.793 --> 01:05:46.887
you joined together to defend our lands.

01:05:47.188 --> 01:05:52.349
You fought for each other. You risked everything for each other.

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:55.326
Lord MacGuffin. My dad saved your life

01:05:55.361 --> 01:05:58.097
stopping an arrow as you ran to Dingwall's aid.

01:05:58.098 --> 01:06:00.256
Aye, and I'll never forget it.

01:06:00.257 --> 01:06:03.297
And lord Macintosh. You saved my dad

01:06:03.298 --> 01:06:06.476
when you charged in on heavy horse and held off the advance.

01:06:06.477 --> 01:06:11.351
And we all know how lord Dingwall broke the enemy line...

01:06:11.352 --> 01:06:13.194
With a mighty throw of a spear!

01:06:13.195 --> 01:06:16.456
I was aiming at you, you big topsy!

01:06:17.366 --> 01:06:20.112
The story of this kingdom is a powerful one.

01:06:20.313 --> 01:06:24.927
My dad rallied your forces and you made him your king.

01:06:25.228 --> 01:06:29.947
It was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship.

01:06:29.948 --> 01:06:31.247
And it lives to this day.

01:06:37.096 --> 01:06:38.938
But I've been selfish.

01:06:39.389 --> 01:06:42.347
I tore a great rift in our kingdom.

01:06:43.412 --> 01:06:45.051
There's no one to blame but me.

01:06:46.432 --> 01:06:53.323
And I know now that I need to mend my mistake and mend our bond.

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:58.160
And so, there is the matter of my betrothal.

01:06:59.737 --> 01:07:02.652
I've decided to do what's right.

01:07:02.904 --> 01:07:08.904
And....and....and...

01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:14.705
Break...tradition.

01:07:19.904 --> 01:07:24.031
My mother...the Queen,

01:07:24.332 --> 01:07:29.193
feels...in her heart,

01:07:29.194 --> 01:07:34.000
that I....that we

01:07:34.001 --> 01:07:40.925
be free to...write our own story.

01:07:42.438 --> 01:07:46.196
Follow...our...hearts.

01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:51.492
And find love in our own time.

01:07:55.231 --> 01:07:57.964
That's beautiful.

01:07:57.965 --> 01:08:01.336
The Queen and I put the decision to you, my lords.

01:08:02.337 --> 01:08:06.092
Might our young people decide for themselves who they will love?

01:08:07.074 --> 01:08:10.560
Well, since you've obviously made up your minds about this

01:08:10.561 --> 01:08:13.553
I have one thing to say. This is...

01:08:13.588 --> 01:08:14.634
...a grand idea!

01:08:15.035 --> 01:08:17.756
Give us our own say in choosing our fate!

01:08:17.757 --> 01:08:18.267
What?

01:08:18.268 --> 01:08:21.010
Aye, why shouldn't we choose?

01:08:21.011 --> 01:08:23.207
But she's the princess!

01:08:23.208 --> 01:08:26.142
I didnae pick her out, it was your idea.

01:08:26.143 --> 01:08:29.437
And you? You feel the same way?

01:08:29.631 --> 01:08:35.751
(unintelligible Doric accent)

01:08:39.825 --> 01:08:43.747
Well, that settles it. Let these lads try and win her heart

01:08:43.748 --> 01:08:46.168
before they win her hand.

01:08:46.169 --> 01:08:47.662
If they can.

01:08:47.663 --> 01:08:50.707
I say that we, Dingwall, has a fighting chance.

01:08:50.708 --> 01:08:54.477
Fine then, seems that once we're agreed. It was my idea in the first place.

01:09:06.004 --> 01:09:07.569
Just like your mom.

01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:09.386
You devil.

01:09:15.617 --> 01:09:17.636
Everyone, to the cellar!

01:09:17.637 --> 01:09:21.938
Let's crack open the king's private reserve to celebrate!

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:30.475
Psst. Bring the tiny glasses.

01:09:45.032 --> 01:09:45.732
The tapestry!

01:09:48.710 --> 01:09:50.040
Mend the bond.

01:09:52.278 --> 01:09:53.546
Mend the bond!

01:09:54.526 --> 01:09:55.864
Stitch it up!

01:09:55.865 --> 01:09:58.787
This'll change you back. We just need needle and thread.

01:10:06.455 --> 01:10:07.467
Mom?

01:10:09.445 --> 01:10:14.413
Mom? Not now! No, please, not now!

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:16.977
Mom?

01:10:19.984 --> 01:10:24.091
We'll boil your head with dumpling bread, to make an ursine stew.

01:10:25.344 --> 01:10:31.082
Elinor, dear, you'll never guess who just solved our little suitor problem.

01:10:43.118 --> 01:10:45.961
Elinor!

01:10:47.445 --> 01:10:48.622
It can't be true!

01:10:48.623 --> 01:10:51.001
Elinor! Answer me, lass!

01:10:51.002 --> 01:10:53.417
Elinor!

01:10:54.346 --> 01:10:55.616
Merida!

01:10:57.011 --> 01:10:57.406
What the...

01:10:57.407 --> 01:10:59.399
Dad! No! It's not what you think!

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.610
Merida, get back!

01:11:00.911 --> 01:11:01.901
No!

01:11:06.095 --> 01:11:06.795
No!

01:11:06.796 --> 01:11:08.420
Dad, don't hurt her!

01:11:11.332 --> 01:11:13.164
Merida, no!

01:11:18.006 --> 01:11:19.645
No!

01:11:28.021 --> 01:11:28.921
Mom!

01:11:33.298 --> 01:11:35.296
It's all right. I'm all right. It's nothing.

01:11:35.297 --> 01:11:37.881
It's just a little scratch.

01:11:37.882 --> 01:11:38.762
Mom!

01:11:39.063 --> 01:11:42.909
My liege! Fergus!

01:11:43.794 --> 01:11:44.894
Bear!

01:11:46.037 --> 01:11:46.972
Dad!

01:11:46.973 --> 01:11:48.298
Oh, count your stars, lass.

01:11:48.299 --> 01:11:50.269
It almost had you. Are you hurt?

01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:51.786
It's your wife, Elinor!

01:12:00.293 --> 01:12:01.692
You're talking nonsense!

01:12:01.693 --> 01:12:04.804
It's the truth! There was a witch and she gave me a spell.

01:12:04.805 --> 01:12:06.117
It's not Mor'du!

01:12:06.118 --> 01:12:08.154
Mor'du or not, I'll avenge your mother.

01:12:08.155 --> 01:12:10.465
But I'll not risk loosing you too.

01:12:10.466 --> 01:12:11.980
No, dad! Just listen to me!

01:12:11.981 --> 01:12:16.985
Listen. You can't. It's your wife Elinor!

01:12:16.986 --> 01:12:19.495
Maudie. Keep this. And don't let her out!

01:12:19.496 --> 01:12:21.105
What about the bear?

01:12:21.106 --> 01:12:22.568
Just stay put!

01:12:49.252 --> 01:12:51.529
Come on, you sorry bunch of galoots.

01:13:00.973 --> 01:13:01.905
Mom!

01:13:01.906 --> 01:13:05.767
No. No. Mom.

01:13:26.706 --> 01:13:27.406
Maudie.

01:13:28.085 --> 01:13:29.507
Maudie!

01:13:29.508 --> 01:13:31.347
I need you!

01:13:31.348 --> 01:13:32.869
Now!

01:13:37.932 --> 01:13:39.495
Oh, no.

01:13:40.535 --> 01:13:41.847
Maudie.

01:13:47.832 --> 01:13:48.832
Get the key!

01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:10.928
Maudie!

01:14:16.957 --> 01:14:19.255
Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Needle and thread.

01:14:38.054 --> 01:14:39.152
There he goes!

01:14:39.153 --> 01:14:43.815
Needle and thread. Needle and thread. Ah, you beauty!

01:15:09.745 --> 01:15:10.488
One...

01:15:11.323 --> 01:15:12.064
...two...

01:15:42.508 --> 01:15:44.016
Steady, Hamish!

01:15:44.938 --> 01:15:46.019
There he goes!

01:16:04.577 --> 01:16:06.458
Back! Back! Get him! Get him!

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:10.649
Angus!

01:16:13.356 --> 01:16:14.056
No!

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.608
Hubert, Harris, help Hamish!

01:16:24.034 --> 01:16:25.888
Give me a hand over here!

01:16:59.334 --> 01:17:02.047
Get back, that's my mother!

01:17:02.048 --> 01:17:03.958
Are you out of your mind, lass?

01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:05.630
Mom, are you hurt?

01:17:12.602 --> 01:17:13.493
Merida!

01:17:16.612 --> 01:17:19.319
I'll not let you kill my mother!

01:17:20.706 --> 01:17:21.306
Boys!

01:17:23.506 --> 01:17:24.655
Boys?

01:17:31.055 --> 01:17:32.212
Mor'du!

01:17:32.213 --> 01:17:33.652
Kill it!

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:38.964
Scoundrel!

01:17:42.890 --> 01:17:46.320
Come on! I'll take you with my bare hands!

01:18:19.908 --> 01:18:21.029
Mom!

01:19:37.949 --> 01:19:39.451
The second sunrise!

01:20:18.934 --> 01:20:19.988
Oh, no.

01:20:22.555 --> 01:20:24.335
I don't understand, I...

01:20:36.041 --> 01:20:36.987
Oh, mom!

01:20:38.162 --> 01:20:39.841
I'm sorry.

01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.528
This is all my fault!

01:20:43.723 --> 01:20:45.186
I did this to you!

01:20:45.987 --> 01:20:46.944
To us!

01:20:54.237 --> 01:20:56.423
You've always been there for me.

01:20:57.524 --> 01:20:59.388
You've never given up on me.

01:21:01.515 --> 01:21:03.467
I just want you back!

01:21:08.915 --> 01:21:11.036
I want you back, mommy!

01:21:30.458 --> 01:21:32.026
I love you.

01:22:00.398 --> 01:22:02.845
Mom, you're back!

01:22:09.053 --> 01:22:10.858
You changed!

01:22:11.059 --> 01:22:12.187
Oh, darling.

01:22:13.388 --> 01:22:15.598
We both have.

01:22:16.168 --> 01:22:17.793
Elinor!

01:22:22.774 --> 01:22:23.574
Elinor.

01:22:31.820 --> 01:22:33.077
Oh, dear!

01:22:34.203 --> 01:22:37.325
You're back, you're back here!

01:22:38.683 --> 01:22:40.471
Oh, mom!

01:22:42.607 --> 01:22:43.507
Ehm, dear?

01:22:43.945 --> 01:22:46.788
I'm naked. Naked as a wee babby.

01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:49.893
Don't just stare at me, do something!

01:22:51.088 --> 01:22:53.397
What the...avert your eyes, lads!

01:22:53.398 --> 01:22:55.151
Show some respect!

01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:02.836
Now that's what I call a wee naked babby!

01:23:06.557 --> 01:23:09.363
Merida, Elinor, hurry up, we're leaving!

01:23:09.364 --> 01:23:13.406
Mom! Hurry up! ???

01:23:42.993 --> 01:23:47.424
Goodbye! All the best! Fair wind to your sales!

01:23:53.066 --> 01:23:54.997
How did this...oh!

01:24:01.239 --> 01:24:04.635
There are those who say fate is something beyond our command.

01:24:05.477 --> 01:24:07.578
That destiny is not our own.

01:24:08.561 --> 01:24:10.271
But I know better.

01:24:12.331 --> 01:24:14.900
Our fate lives within us.

01:24:16.435 --> 01:24:19.633
You only have to be brave enough to see it.
