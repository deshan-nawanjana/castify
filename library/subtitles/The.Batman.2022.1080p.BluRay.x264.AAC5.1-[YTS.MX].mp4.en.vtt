00:01:29.718 --> 00:01:30.719
Hey!

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.415
<i>...a dark and stormy Halloween.</i>

00:02:04.503 --> 00:02:07.422
<i>Good evening and welcome to
GC-1 News live at 8:00.</i>

00:02:07.506 --> 00:02:09.049
<i>Our top story tonight,</i>

00:02:09.132 --> 00:02:11.468
<i>just-released polls have
incumbent Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:15.388
<i>and 28-year-old grassroots challenger
Bella Reál in a dead heat.</i>

00:02:15.472 --> 00:02:16.973
<i>Things certainly got hot last night</i>

00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:20.519
<i>in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election.</i>

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:24.648
<i>Now, my young opponent here wants to
gut the Gotham Renewal Program,</i>

00:02:24.731 --> 00:02:26.483
<i>established by the great Thomas Wayne.</i>

00:02:26.566 --> 00:02:29.319
<i>Cutting funds from vital projects
like our sea wall</i>

00:02:29.403 --> 00:02:30.862
<i>and the safety net
for those who need it.</i>

00:02:30.946 --> 00:02:35.117
<i>The Renewal Program is broken.
This city's been renewing for 20 years.</i>

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.994
<i>Look where it's gotten us.
Crime has skyrocketed.</i>

00:02:38.078 --> 00:02:39.454
<i>Murder and drug use
are at historic highs.</i>

00:02:39.538 --> 00:02:40.455
<i>Now wait... Now hang on.</i>

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:42.791
<i>We have a masked vigilante
running the street.</i>

00:02:42.874 --> 00:02:43.917
<i>Under my administration,</i>

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.796
<i>the Gotham PD has dealt major blows
to organized crime and drug trafficking.</i>

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.383
<i>The Salvatore Maroni case was
the biggest drug bust in city history.</i>

00:02:51.466 --> 00:02:53.760
<i>But drops and other drugs
are still rampant.</i>

00:02:53.844 --> 00:02:54.803
<i>It's gotten worse.</i>

00:02:54.886 --> 00:02:56.179
<i>I'm not saying there isn't work to do.</i>

00:02:56.263 --> 00:02:57.222
<i>But listen...</i>

00:02:57.305 --> 00:02:58.723
<i>I have a beautiful
wife and young son, okay?</i>

00:02:58.807 --> 00:03:00.267
<i>And I will not rest...</i>

00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:05.772
Hey.

00:03:08.233 --> 00:03:09.943
Yeah, I'm watching it now.

00:03:15.282 --> 00:03:16.825
Why is she still tied?

00:03:21.413 --> 00:03:24.416
But I thought we were getting
a bump in the new <i>Post</i> poll.

00:03:31.506 --> 00:03:33.925
Okay, you know what?
I can't watch this anymore.

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:35.886
Just call me in the morning, okay?

00:03:39.097 --> 00:03:41.516
<i>...who still believes in
everything this city can do.</i>

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.144
<i>We need a leader, Mr. Mitchell,
not a cheerleader.</i>

00:03:44.227 --> 00:03:46.897
<i>And someone who will
tell the people the truth.</i>

00:05:05.684 --> 00:05:08.687
<i>Thursday, October 31st.</i>

00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:24.286
<i>The city streets are crowded
for the holiday.</i>

00:05:27.456 --> 00:05:29.124
<i>Even with the rain.</i>

00:05:32.627 --> 00:05:36.089
<i>Hidden in the chaos is the element,</i>

00:05:37.007 --> 00:05:39.092
<i>waiting to strike like snakes.</i>

00:05:40.594 --> 00:05:42.095
<i>But I'm there too.</i>

00:05:43.138 --> 00:05:44.848
<i>Watching.</i>

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:50.854
<i>Two years of nights have turned me
into a nocturnal animal.</i>

00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:59.029
<i>I must choose my targets carefully.</i>

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:14.503
- Come on! Give me the money.
- Okay.

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.297
- Let's go! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.882
<i>It's a big city.</i>

00:06:23.512 --> 00:06:25.222
<i>I can't be everywhere.</i>

00:06:35.816 --> 00:06:37.734
<i>But they don't know where I am.</i>

00:06:42.906 --> 00:06:44.658
Look at this guy, man.

00:06:49.996 --> 00:06:50.831
Boom!

00:06:51.123 --> 00:06:52.165
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:57.754
So good, man.
That's what I'm talking about!

00:06:57.838 --> 00:06:59.256
Yo, let's see your hits.

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.466
That's you.

00:07:21.945 --> 00:07:25.866
<i>We have a signal now.
For when I'm needed.</i>

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:29.828
<i>But when that light hits the sky,</i>

00:07:30.704 --> 00:07:32.706
<i>it's not just a call.</i>

00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:35.834
<i>It's a warning.</i>

00:07:37.627 --> 00:07:38.628
<i>To them.</i>

00:07:48.346 --> 00:07:49.556
<i>Fear...</i>

00:07:52.893 --> 00:07:54.686
<i>is a tool.</i>

00:08:05.781 --> 00:08:08.950
Are you out of your mind?
Watch where you're goin', drophead!

00:08:20.796 --> 00:08:23.340
<i>They think I'm hiding in the shadows.</i>

00:08:26.301 --> 00:08:27.302
Come on!

00:08:35.727 --> 00:08:37.646
<i>But I am the shadows.</i>

00:08:56.415 --> 00:08:57.999
- Come on, come on.
- Whoo!

00:08:59.376 --> 00:09:00.460
- Hey, go on, man! Go!
- Get him!

00:09:00.544 --> 00:09:02.003
- Come on, man!
- What are you doin'?

00:09:02.963 --> 00:09:04.214
Help!

00:09:04.297 --> 00:09:05.507
Somebody help me!

00:09:06.299 --> 00:09:08.301
Help, help!

00:09:15.183 --> 00:09:16.393
Where you goin', huh?

00:09:21.189 --> 00:09:22.149
Come on.

00:09:22.232 --> 00:09:23.900
Come on, man. Break it.

00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:27.487
You can't move, huh?

00:09:27.863 --> 00:09:29.573
Now knock his ass out.

00:09:29.656 --> 00:09:31.366
Showtime. Showtime, man.

00:09:31.908 --> 00:09:32.993
Come on, man.

00:09:33.076 --> 00:09:34.327
Come on. Do it, man.

00:10:09.654 --> 00:10:11.281
You see this guy?

00:10:18.497 --> 00:10:20.123
The hell are you supposed to be?

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.433
I'm vengeance.

00:10:39.559 --> 00:10:41.478
Holy shit. It's him.

00:11:07.170 --> 00:11:08.296
Hey, man. No, no, no!

00:11:50.046 --> 00:11:51.423
Please don't hurt me.

00:12:27.459 --> 00:12:29.044
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.838
Police action.

00:12:32.422 --> 00:12:34.091
He's with me, Officer.

00:12:36.343 --> 00:12:37.928
Are you kidding me, sir?

00:12:38.845 --> 00:12:40.597
You're gonna let him in here?

00:12:41.264 --> 00:12:44.059
Martinez, let him through.

00:12:57.697 --> 00:12:59.449
Goddamn freak.

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.425
What do we know?

00:13:27.269 --> 00:13:28.645
Detective?

00:13:28.728 --> 00:13:30.355
Sorry, Lieutenant.

00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:35.736
We got blunt force trauma.
Lacerations on the head.

00:13:36.486 --> 00:13:39.656
He got hit a lot of times. And hard.

00:13:42.826 --> 00:13:44.453
All this blood is from his head?

00:13:44.911 --> 00:13:45.912
No.

00:13:50.250 --> 00:13:51.460
Excuse me.

00:13:53.754 --> 00:13:55.630
Most of it's from his hand.

00:14:01.094 --> 00:14:02.137
Thumb was severed.

00:14:03.764 --> 00:14:05.974
Killer may have taken it as a trophy.

00:14:06.349 --> 00:14:08.268
He was alive when it was cut off.

00:14:09.561 --> 00:14:10.979
Ecchymosis...

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:13.774
around the wound.

00:14:28.997 --> 00:14:30.707
Security detail downstairs

00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:33.001
said the family was out
trick-or-treatin'.

00:14:34.503 --> 00:14:36.713
The mayor was up here alone.

00:14:39.132 --> 00:14:41.843
Killer may have come
through the skylight.

00:14:48.225 --> 00:14:50.018
You said there was a card.

00:14:50.102 --> 00:14:51.686
Yeah.

00:15:01.822 --> 00:15:04.866
"From your secret friend. Whoo?

00:15:06.159 --> 00:15:07.869
Haven't a clue?

00:15:07.953 --> 00:15:10.330
Let's play a game, just me and you.

00:15:11.373 --> 00:15:13.917
What does a liar do when he's dead?"

00:15:15.252 --> 00:15:17.337
There's a cipher too.

00:15:24.094 --> 00:15:25.971
Any of this mean anything to you?

00:15:28.515 --> 00:15:29.724
What's going on here?

00:15:32.811 --> 00:15:34.229
I asked him to come, Pete.

00:15:34.312 --> 00:15:35.981
This is a crime scene.

00:15:36.064 --> 00:15:38.400
It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!

00:15:38.483 --> 00:15:40.485
I got the press downstairs.

00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:43.321
You know, I cut you a lot of slack, Jim,
'cause we got history.

00:15:43.405 --> 00:15:45.240
But this is way over the line.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:49.995
Wait.

00:15:50.078 --> 00:15:51.788
- He's involved in this?
- No, he's not involved.

00:15:51.872 --> 00:15:52.998
How do you know?

00:15:53.081 --> 00:15:56.084
He's a goddamn vigilante!
He could be a suspect!

00:15:56.168 --> 00:15:57.919
What are you doin' to me?
We used to be partners.

00:15:58.003 --> 00:15:59.629
I'm just trying
to find the connection, Pete.

00:15:59.713 --> 00:16:01.256
He lies still.

00:16:02.758 --> 00:16:03.759
Excuse me?

00:16:05.302 --> 00:16:06.386
The riddle.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:10.390
What does a liar do when he's dead?
He lies still.

00:16:19.524 --> 00:16:21.026
Oh, Jesus.

00:16:24.279 --> 00:16:27.074
This must be your favorite night
of the year, huh, pal?

00:16:28.075 --> 00:16:29.910
Happy fuckin' Halloween.

00:16:30.702 --> 00:16:32.329
Excuse me, Commissioner.

00:16:33.413 --> 00:16:35.082
They're ready for your statement.

00:16:39.127 --> 00:16:40.837
I want him outta here.

00:16:41.463 --> 00:16:42.547
Now!

00:16:49.137 --> 00:16:50.347
Come on.

00:17:03.151 --> 00:17:04.361
Yeah.

00:17:05.612 --> 00:17:07.030
The kid found him.

00:17:12.035 --> 00:17:15.038
Was there anyone else
in the house when you arrived?

00:17:31.471 --> 00:17:33.640
We really gotta go, man.

00:17:39.229 --> 00:17:42.941
<i>Tonight, a son lost a father.</i>

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.235
A wife lost a husband.

00:17:46.445 --> 00:17:47.988
And I lost a friend.

00:17:49.072 --> 00:17:51.616
Mayor Mitchell
was a fighter for the city,

00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:54.786
and I will not rest
until his killer is found.

00:17:55.245 --> 00:17:57.414
<i>This was a truly senseless crime,</i>

00:17:58.165 --> 00:18:01.585
<i>and we are actively pursuing
every investigative lead we have</i>

00:18:01.668 --> 00:18:05.756
<i>in order to identify the perpetrator
and hunt him down.</i>

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:07.090
<i>I've spoken to the governor...</i>

00:18:07.174 --> 00:18:10.010
<i>I wish I could say
I'm making a difference,</i>

00:18:10.093 --> 00:18:11.678
<i>but I don't know.</i>

00:18:17.601 --> 00:18:20.479
<i>Murder, robberies, assault.</i>

00:18:20.562 --> 00:18:22.647
<i>Two years later, they're all up.</i>

00:18:23.398 --> 00:18:24.733
<i>And now this.</i>

00:18:26.902 --> 00:18:28.487
<i>The city's eating itself.</i>

00:18:31.198 --> 00:18:32.449
<i>Maybe it's beyond saving.</i>

00:18:34.534 --> 00:18:36.828
<i>But I have to try.</i>

00:18:37.621 --> 00:18:38.872
<i>Push myself.</i>

00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.462
<i>These nights all roll together in a rush</i>

00:19:28.422 --> 00:19:30.340
<i>behind the mask.</i>

00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:37.139
<i>Sometimes in the morning,</i>

00:19:38.932 --> 00:19:41.101
<i>I have to force myself to remember</i>

00:19:43.478 --> 00:19:45.063
<i>everything that happened.</i>

00:19:59.619 --> 00:20:01.204
<i>Unbelievable
breaking news this hour, everyone.</i>

00:20:01.288 --> 00:20:05.167
<i>Again, four-term incumbent
Gotham Mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:08.086
<i>was found murdered last night
inside his home</i>

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:09.921
<i>in the exclusive Crest Hill district.</i>

00:20:10.005 --> 00:20:11.673
<i>Exact details of the crime</i>

00:20:11.757 --> 00:20:13.258
<i>still have not been released,</i>

00:20:13.341 --> 00:20:16.219
<i>but a citywide manhunt
is already underway</i>

00:20:16.303 --> 00:20:19.556
<i>as police and FBI search
for the brazen killer.</i>

00:20:19.681 --> 00:20:21.475
<i>And this certainly is not the first time</i>

00:20:21.558 --> 00:20:24.102
<i>Gotham has been rocked by
the murder of a political figure.</i>

00:20:24.186 --> 00:20:28.440
<i>In fact, in an eerie coincidence,
it was 20 years ago this week</i>

00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:30.275
<i>that celebrated
billionaire philanthropist</i>

00:20:30.358 --> 00:20:32.319
<i>Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha</i>

00:20:32.402 --> 00:20:35.238
<i>were slain during Wayne's
own mayoral campaign.</i>

00:20:35.322 --> 00:20:39.159
<i>It was a shocking crime
that remains unsolved to this day.</i>

00:20:39.242 --> 00:20:41.036
<i>Don Mitchell, Jr.'s political career</i>

00:20:41.119 --> 00:20:43.789
<i>was especially notable
for his tough war on drugs</i>

00:20:43.872 --> 00:20:47.125
<i>when he and city police
launched a major sting operation,</i>

00:20:47.209 --> 00:20:51.171
<i>resulting in the arrest of notorious
mafia crime figure Salvatore Maroni</i>

00:20:51.254 --> 00:20:55.425
<i>with what, to this day, remains
the biggest drug bust in GCPD history.</i>

00:20:55.509 --> 00:20:56.927
I assume you heard about this.

00:20:58.804 --> 00:21:00.055
Yeah.

00:21:07.062 --> 00:21:08.396
Oh, I see.

00:21:09.231 --> 00:21:11.149
<i>All this blood is from his head?</i>

00:21:11.691 --> 00:21:12.901
Dear God.

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.703
<i>There's a cipher too.</i>

00:21:31.711 --> 00:21:34.005
<i>Any of this mean anything to you?</i>

00:21:37.175 --> 00:21:38.969
The killer left this for the Batman?

00:21:40.387 --> 00:21:42.055
<i>I asked him to come, Pete.</i>

00:21:42.139 --> 00:21:43.140
Apparently.

00:21:43.432 --> 00:21:45.308
You're becoming quite a celebrity.

00:21:47.352 --> 00:21:48.687
Why is he writing to you?

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:50.188
<i>It's Mitchell, for chrissakes!</i>

00:21:50.272 --> 00:21:51.314
I don't know yet.

00:21:51.398 --> 00:21:52.941
<i>I got the press downstairs.</i>

00:21:54.818 --> 00:21:56.236
Have a shower.

00:21:57.696 --> 00:21:59.364
Our accounting friends
at Wayne Enterprises

00:21:59.448 --> 00:22:00.365
are coming for breakfast.

00:22:00.449 --> 00:22:02.451
Here? Why?

00:22:02.534 --> 00:22:03.618
Because I couldn't get you to go there.

00:22:03.702 --> 00:22:04.786
I haven't got time for this.

00:22:04.870 --> 00:22:06.538
It's getting serious, Bruce.

00:22:06.621 --> 00:22:09.708
If this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left.

00:22:09.791 --> 00:22:11.376
I don't care about that.

00:22:12.294 --> 00:22:13.170
Any of that.

00:22:13.253 --> 00:22:14.755
You don't care about
your family's legacy?

00:22:17.132 --> 00:22:20.260
What I'm doing is my family's legacy.

00:22:20.343 --> 00:22:22.512
If I can't change things here,

00:22:23.054 --> 00:22:24.973
if I can't have an effect,

00:22:26.057 --> 00:22:27.684
then I don't care what happens to me.

00:22:27.768 --> 00:22:28.894
That's what I'm afraid of.

00:22:28.977 --> 00:22:30.604
Alfred, stop.

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.440
You're not my father.

00:22:36.234 --> 00:22:37.652
I'm well aware.

00:23:11.978 --> 00:23:14.231
<i>We really gotta go, man.</i>

00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:41.466
Some fresh berries there.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:49.766
What are you doing?

00:23:50.142 --> 00:23:53.812
Just reminiscing about
my days in the Circus.

00:23:54.187 --> 00:23:58.108
This is actually quite elusive.

00:24:01.111 --> 00:24:02.779
Where'd you get those O's?

00:24:04.322 --> 00:24:07.117
"He lies still" is only a partial key.

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:09.619
It only gives us H, E, L, I, S, and T.

00:24:09.703 --> 00:24:13.749
So, I'm looking for any double symbols
to start, trying letters,

00:24:13.832 --> 00:24:15.208
see where it leads.

00:24:17.127 --> 00:24:18.128
That's interesting.

00:24:19.379 --> 00:24:20.505
Mr. Pennyworth?

00:24:20.881 --> 00:24:21.882
Yes, Dory?

00:24:22.215 --> 00:24:23.675
The accountants are here.

00:24:23.759 --> 00:24:25.594
See them in, please, Dory.

00:24:28.513 --> 00:24:30.724
<i>What if it's not a partial key?</i>

00:24:30.807 --> 00:24:32.392
What do you mean?

00:24:32.476 --> 00:24:34.311
What if this is the whole key?

00:24:35.228 --> 00:24:37.773
Ignore the symbols
we don't have letters for.

00:24:37.856 --> 00:24:39.900
Use only the letters from
"He lies still" and leave the rest...

00:24:39.983 --> 00:24:41.151
Blank. Yeah, I understand.

00:24:41.234 --> 00:24:43.361
But that would leave
most of the cipher unsolved.

00:24:43.445 --> 00:24:45.280
I don't see how that's gonna...

00:24:47.824 --> 00:24:48.825
Oh.

00:25:02.631 --> 00:25:04.299
Damn.

00:25:04.466 --> 00:25:06.718
Yeah, he's got a car.

00:25:07.636 --> 00:25:10.013
Guess it's good to be the mayor.

00:25:10.097 --> 00:25:11.765
Where to even start?

00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:14.684
You sure this isn't a leap?
"Drive" could mean anything.

00:25:14.768 --> 00:25:15.769
You don't trust me?

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:18.396
You mean like you trust me?

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.358
It's been two years now,
and I don't even know who you are, man.

00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:24.486
There.

00:25:47.592 --> 00:25:48.885
What are we looking for?

00:25:49.511 --> 00:25:51.054
A USB port.

00:25:51.138 --> 00:25:52.264
USB?

00:25:59.354 --> 00:26:00.522
What?

00:26:05.902 --> 00:26:08.155
"Thumb" drive.

00:26:08.947 --> 00:26:10.574
Jesus.

00:26:14.202 --> 00:26:15.704
It's encrypted.

00:26:19.124 --> 00:26:20.417
Try this.

00:26:27.424 --> 00:26:29.801
Oh, this guy's hilarious.

00:26:38.685 --> 00:26:41.271
Oh, well, well, well.

00:26:41.688 --> 00:26:43.940
So much for family values.

00:26:44.107 --> 00:26:45.275
Who is she?

00:26:45.358 --> 00:26:46.943
No idea.

00:26:47.861 --> 00:26:50.697
But that's the Penguin,
Carmine Falcone's right hand.

00:26:51.031 --> 00:26:52.532
I know who he is.

00:26:52.991 --> 00:26:53.992
What was that?

00:26:55.744 --> 00:26:58.580
Shit, shit! The drive.

00:26:59.331 --> 00:27:01.666
It sent out the photos from my account.

00:27:01.750 --> 00:27:04.294
<i>Gotham Post, Gazette,</i> GC-1, all of them.

00:27:04.377 --> 00:27:06.463
Jesus.

00:27:06.546 --> 00:27:08.924
I'm gonna catch hell for this.
Pete's gonna bust a gasket.

00:27:09.007 --> 00:27:10.467
"He lies still."

00:27:10.675 --> 00:27:11.718
About her?

00:27:12.969 --> 00:27:14.554
Maybe.

00:27:14.721 --> 00:27:16.598
That's the Iceberg Lounge.

00:27:16.681 --> 00:27:20.102
It's under the Shoreline Lofts
where Falcone was holed up.

00:27:20.185 --> 00:27:22.312
Never get in there without a warrant.

00:27:24.648 --> 00:27:25.732
Yeah.

00:27:38.829 --> 00:27:40.038
Know who I am?

00:27:41.373 --> 00:27:43.625
Yeah. I got an idea.

00:27:44.084 --> 00:27:45.502
I want to see the Penguin.

00:27:46.211 --> 00:27:48.463
I don't know
what you're talking about, pal.

00:27:53.844 --> 00:27:54.845
What's the problem?

00:27:54.928 --> 00:27:56.346
Says he wants to see the Penguin.

00:27:56.430 --> 00:27:58.598
Penguin? There's no Penguin here.

00:27:58.682 --> 00:28:00.308
That's what I tried to tell him.

00:28:00.392 --> 00:28:02.686
Get out of here, freak. You hear me?

00:28:02.769 --> 00:28:04.646
Or that little suit's
gonna get all full of blood.

00:28:06.022 --> 00:28:07.107
Mine or yours?

00:28:15.449 --> 00:28:16.408
Get him!

00:28:16.491 --> 00:28:17.659
I saw that whole thing.

00:28:17.743 --> 00:28:18.952
He's over there!

00:28:19.035 --> 00:28:20.370
What is your problem?

00:29:03.038 --> 00:29:05.207
Hey! Put the bat down,
or I'll blow your head off!

00:29:15.801 --> 00:29:17.219
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:29:17.344 --> 00:29:19.471
Take it easy, sweetheart.

00:29:19.554 --> 00:29:21.348
You looking for me?

00:29:22.057 --> 00:29:23.975
I see you met the twins.

00:29:24.935 --> 00:29:28.230
Boy, you're everything they say,
ain't ya?

00:29:29.106 --> 00:29:30.607
I guess we both are.

00:29:32.651 --> 00:29:34.069
How you doing?

00:29:34.694 --> 00:29:36.113
I'm Oz.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.911
Who is she?

00:29:45.956 --> 00:29:47.874
I really don't know, chief.

00:29:48.583 --> 00:29:50.794
I might have been coming out
at the same time,

00:29:50.877 --> 00:29:52.254
but I wasn't rolling with them.

00:30:05.684 --> 00:30:06.685
It's okay, baby.

00:30:07.227 --> 00:30:11.022
Mr. Vengeance here, he don't bite.
Come on.

00:30:36.757 --> 00:30:37.966
Thank you, honey.

00:30:44.473 --> 00:30:46.308
Here you go, champ.

00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:49.936
I wanna know who she is,
and what she has to do with this murder.

00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.813
- Whose murder?
- The mayor's.

00:30:52.314 --> 00:30:53.690
Is that the mayor?

00:30:53.774 --> 00:30:55.567
Oh, shit, it is. Look at that.

00:30:56.777 --> 00:30:58.070
Don't make me hurt you.

00:30:58.153 --> 00:31:02.324
You better watch it.
You know my reputation?

00:31:02.407 --> 00:31:05.368
Yeah, I do. Do you?

00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.622
Look...

00:31:09.873 --> 00:31:12.667
I'm just the proprietor, okay?

00:31:13.502 --> 00:31:17.798
I mean, what people do here
ain't got nothing to do with me.

00:31:26.139 --> 00:31:27.724
Tell you one thing.

00:31:29.893 --> 00:31:33.480
Whoever she is, she's one hot chick.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.483
Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

00:31:39.736 --> 00:31:41.571
What? Too soon?

00:31:51.415 --> 00:31:53.792
You let me know
if there's anything else I can do.

00:32:03.093 --> 00:32:04.094
Taxi!

00:32:06.596 --> 00:32:07.597
Taxi!

00:32:26.366 --> 00:32:27.659
Hey, it's me.

00:32:28.952 --> 00:32:30.287
Baby, what's wrong?

00:32:30.954 --> 00:32:32.956
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, slow down. I can't...

00:32:35.417 --> 00:32:36.835
On the news?

00:32:37.502 --> 00:32:40.797
Okay. No. No, stay there.
Wait for me, okay?

00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:42.591
Wait for me, I'm on my way home.

00:32:43.759 --> 00:32:47.387
Listen, baby, we're gonna get
the hell out of here, okay? I promise.

00:32:48.096 --> 00:32:50.724
If we have to leave earlier,
we'll leave tonight.

00:32:51.641 --> 00:32:52.809
Uh...

00:32:55.020 --> 00:32:56.354
God damn it.

00:33:16.333 --> 00:33:18.335
<i>...photos of
murdered mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

<i>with a younger mystery woman.</i>

00:33:20.378 --> 00:33:23.215
<i>In a shocking development, the police

00:33:56.665 --> 00:33:59.584
<i>Now they urge her to contact the GCPD...</i>

00:36:14.094 --> 00:36:15.429
You're pretty good at that.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:49.171
Hey! Give me that.

00:36:52.799 --> 00:36:55.343
"Kosolov, Annika."

00:36:56.845 --> 00:36:58.930
He hurt her? That's why you killed him?

00:36:59.014 --> 00:37:01.767
What? Oh, please.
Just give me the goddamn...

00:37:39.846 --> 00:37:42.474
Listen, honey,
you got the wrong idea, okay?

00:37:42.557 --> 00:37:45.018
I didn't kill anybody.
I'm here for my friend.

00:37:45.102 --> 00:37:46.478
She's trying to
get the hell out of here,

00:37:46.561 --> 00:37:48.313
and this son of a bitch
stole her passport.

00:37:48.396 --> 00:37:49.773
What does she know?

00:37:49.856 --> 00:37:51.983
Whatever it is, it's got her so spooked
she won't even tell me.

00:37:52.067 --> 00:37:53.652
She did seem upset.

00:37:55.445 --> 00:37:56.947
Back at your place.

00:37:58.990 --> 00:38:00.492
Let's go talk to her.

00:38:26.685 --> 00:38:27.769
Anni!

00:38:29.062 --> 00:38:30.147

00:38:54.129 --> 00:38:56.965
Jesus, what are they gonna do to her?
She's just a kid.

00:38:58.842 --> 00:39:00.594
Shit, they took my phone.

00:40:57.043 --> 00:40:58.253
Who?

00:40:58.837 --> 00:41:01.256
A lot of guys that shouldn't be there,
I can tell you that.

00:41:02.841 --> 00:41:05.510
Your basic upstanding citizen types.

00:41:07.763 --> 00:41:09.306
You're gonna help me on this.

00:41:09.931 --> 00:41:11.433
For your friend.

00:41:22.027 --> 00:41:23.361
You got a lot of cats.

00:41:24.863 --> 00:41:26.782
I have a thing about strays.

00:41:30.911 --> 00:41:32.245
You're not safe here.

00:41:33.371 --> 00:41:34.539
I can take care of myself.

00:41:34.623 --> 00:41:37.417
<i>Two public figures now dead
in just the last two nights,</i>

00:41:37.501 --> 00:41:39.044
<i>and only days before the election.</i>

00:41:39.127 --> 00:41:42.380
<i>Police and city officials
are left searching for a killer</i>

00:41:42.464 --> 00:41:45.300
<i>and hoping to find him
before he kills again.</i>

00:42:03.318 --> 00:42:06.488
He waited for him at the gym.

00:42:07.614 --> 00:42:09.658
Pete always liked to work out
late at night,

00:42:09.741 --> 00:42:11.868
when no one else was around.

00:42:12.994 --> 00:42:14.413
There's a needle mark on his neck.

00:42:14.496 --> 00:42:16.456
Injected him with arsenic.

00:42:18.458 --> 00:42:19.793
Rat poison.

00:42:20.585 --> 00:42:22.170
Yeah.

00:42:22.337 --> 00:42:24.798
That seems to be his theme here.

00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:26.716
Look at this thing.

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.601
It's a maze.

00:42:39.187 --> 00:42:42.482
What kind of demented son of a bitch
does this to a person?

00:42:45.235 --> 00:42:46.319
More symbols.

00:42:48.822 --> 00:42:50.407
It's another cipher.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:53.243
He blasted these out
after his message went viral.

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:56.496
Bastard murders you and your reputation.

00:42:56.580 --> 00:42:59.708
That guy pushes drops. On the east end.

00:43:01.293 --> 00:43:02.627
I don't get it.

00:43:02.711 --> 00:43:05.088
Why would Pete get involved
in something like this?

00:43:06.006 --> 00:43:08.008
Looks like he got greedy.

00:43:08.091 --> 00:43:09.134
You kidding me?

00:43:09.217 --> 00:43:11.928
After everything we did
to take down the Maronis?

00:43:12.012 --> 00:43:15.265
We busted their entire operation,
then he caves to some lowlife dealer?

00:43:15.348 --> 00:43:17.559
Maybe he's not who you thought.

00:43:19.102 --> 00:43:21.146
You make it sound like he had it coming.

00:43:23.398 --> 00:43:24.858
He was a cop.

00:43:26.193 --> 00:43:27.486
Crossed a line.

00:43:58.725 --> 00:44:00.393
"I'm mad about you.

00:44:00.477 --> 00:44:04.147
Want to know my name?
Just look inside and see."

00:44:11.279 --> 00:44:14.366
"Follow the maze until you find the rat.

00:44:14.533 --> 00:44:18.120
Bring him into the light,
and you'll find where I'm at."

00:44:18.203 --> 00:44:19.913
The hell is that?

00:44:20.664 --> 00:44:23.834
"Bring him into the light"?
"Find the rat"?

00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.461
I don't know.

00:44:27.337 --> 00:44:28.505
Lieutenant.

00:44:28.588 --> 00:44:30.006
They're coming back.

00:44:30.090 --> 00:44:31.341
We got to get out of here.

00:44:35.429 --> 00:44:36.638
Come on.

00:44:41.726 --> 00:44:42.769
Ow!

00:44:44.229 --> 00:44:45.564
I don't know about these things.

00:44:45.647 --> 00:44:49.109
I need to see in there,
this hunting ground.

00:44:53.113 --> 00:44:55.699
Hey, why am I starting to feel
like a fish on a hook?

00:44:57.576 --> 00:44:59.035
I'm just looking for Annika.

00:45:03.331 --> 00:45:04.958
Boy, you're a real sweetheart.

00:45:06.084 --> 00:45:08.712
You really don't care what happens to me
in there tonight, do you?

00:45:18.263 --> 00:45:19.473
Look at me.

00:45:29.107 --> 00:45:31.276
Looks good. Here.

00:46:14.444 --> 00:46:16.446
I got you. Can you hear me?

00:46:17.406 --> 00:46:18.407
Yeah.

00:46:27.082 --> 00:46:28.083
Hey, where you goin'?

00:46:28.708 --> 00:46:29.835
Hospitality.

00:46:30.585 --> 00:46:33.422
<i>That's one of the guys
I got into it with the other night.</i>

00:46:35.215 --> 00:46:36.716
<i>Looks like I broke his nose.</i>

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:45.475
"Kenzie, William."

00:46:45.559 --> 00:46:47.018
He's an off-duty cop.

00:46:48.895 --> 00:46:50.564
Are you sure no one can see
these things in my eyes?

00:46:50.897 --> 00:46:52.941
Don't worry. I'm watching you.

00:47:09.499 --> 00:47:12.627
Don't look away.
I need time to make IDs.

00:47:12.711 --> 00:47:13.837
Great.

00:47:21.094 --> 00:47:23.388
These guys have a little problem
with eye contact, don't they?

00:47:23.472 --> 00:47:25.056
Feels good, doesn't it?

00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:27.350
Yeah, baby. Feels real good.

00:47:33.398 --> 00:47:35.025
<i>Jesus, I hate dropheads.</i>

00:47:35.108 --> 00:47:36.151
Really?

00:47:36.234 --> 00:47:37.194
'Cause when I first saw you,

00:47:37.277 --> 00:47:38.487
it looked like you were
dealing for Penguin.

00:47:38.570 --> 00:47:40.822
You don't know
what you're talking about. Can we not...

00:47:41.448 --> 00:47:43.200
Can we not do this right now?

00:47:45.118 --> 00:47:46.661
Wait. Who was that?

00:47:46.745 --> 00:47:47.913
Oh, I saw him.

00:47:47.996 --> 00:47:49.081
<i>Look back.</i>

00:47:49.164 --> 00:47:50.957
If I look back, it's gonna be
a whole can of worms.

00:47:51.041 --> 00:47:52.375
I need to see his face.

00:47:54.044 --> 00:47:55.504
Jesus.

00:48:03.512 --> 00:48:04.679
That's the DA.

00:48:04.763 --> 00:48:05.806
<i>Gil Colson.</i>

00:48:05.889 --> 00:48:07.557
And he's coming over. You happy?

00:48:07.641 --> 00:48:08.850
<i>Talk to him.</i>

00:48:11.978 --> 00:48:13.063
Hey. How you doing?

00:48:13.146 --> 00:48:14.231
Hi.

00:48:14.314 --> 00:48:15.148
I'm Gil.

00:48:16.358 --> 00:48:17.984
Hey, aren't you the DA?

00:48:18.068 --> 00:48:19.027
Yeah.

00:48:19.236 --> 00:48:21.405
Wow. I've seen you on TV.

00:48:21.488 --> 00:48:22.864
Is that right?

00:48:23.281 --> 00:48:25.492
I haven't seen you around here before.

00:48:26.493 --> 00:48:28.537
It's a hell of a time
to be the new girl,

00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:31.164
'cause people are all a little on edge.

00:48:31.248 --> 00:48:32.749
<i>Oh, honey, I live on the edge.</i>

00:48:32.833 --> 00:48:33.834
<i>Is that right?</i>

00:48:34.126 --> 00:48:35.335
<i>I like that.</i>

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:36.753
Do you want to come over?

00:48:36.837 --> 00:48:37.963
Sure.

00:48:40.966 --> 00:48:42.300
- <i>This is Travis.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

00:48:42.384 --> 00:48:43.802
<i>You wanna take a seat over there?</i>

00:48:44.094 --> 00:48:45.971
- <i>Richie, Glen.</i>
- <i>Hey.</i>

00:48:47.431 --> 00:48:48.932
That's half the DA's office.

00:48:49.015 --> 00:48:50.183
<i>You know Carla here, huh?</i>

00:48:50.267 --> 00:48:51.226
Hi.

00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:53.353
That's Cheri. Don't mind her,
she's just taking a break.

00:48:53.437 --> 00:48:55.313
Drowning our sorrows.

00:48:55.647 --> 00:48:56.940
<i>You want a drop?</i>

00:48:57.023 --> 00:48:59.067
<i>Uh, no, I'm good.
But you enjoy.</i>

00:49:01.027 --> 00:49:02.696
<i>Hope you don't mind.</i>

00:49:02.779 --> 00:49:04.823
<i>I got a lot on my shoulders
with that psycho running around.</i>

00:49:05.282 --> 00:49:06.241
He's wasted.

00:49:06.324 --> 00:49:07.367
No shit.

00:49:09.035 --> 00:49:10.036
<i>I like this girl.</i>

00:49:10.495 --> 00:49:12.080
Oh, hey, I like you too!

00:49:15.625 --> 00:49:18.962
<i>I mean, this Riddler, he's going after
the most powerful people in the city.</i>

00:49:19.045 --> 00:49:20.130
<i>He knows so much.</i>

00:49:20.213 --> 00:49:21.506
<i>He doesn't know shit, man.</i>

00:49:21.590 --> 00:49:23.842
<i>What are you talking about?
Yeah, he does! What about that rat...</i>

00:49:23.925 --> 00:49:24.843
<i>Hey, hey, Gil, come on.</i>

00:49:24.926 --> 00:49:26.845
- <i>Think maybe you had a little too much.</i>
- Hey. The rat.

00:49:26.928 --> 00:49:28.889
- <i>Slow down.</i>
- Ask him about the rat.

00:49:30.891 --> 00:49:32.726
<i>Hey, what's this about a rat?</i>

00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:44.279
<i>I mean...</i>

00:49:45.113 --> 00:49:48.700
<i>there was a rat. We had an informant.</i>

00:49:49.284 --> 00:49:51.703
<i>We had big-time information
on Salvatore Maroni.</i>

00:49:51.787 --> 00:49:53.497
<i>That's how we got him out of
the drops business.</i>

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.165
He's talking about the Maroni case.

00:49:55.248 --> 00:49:58.543
<i>But if this guy knows,
it's gonna come out.</i>

00:49:59.127 --> 00:50:01.421
<i>And when it does,
this whole city's gonna come apart.</i>

00:50:01.505 --> 00:50:03.423
<i>Okay, I don't wanna hear this.</i>

00:50:03.507 --> 00:50:06.134
<i>This is the kind of pillow talk
that got that Russian girl disappeared.</i>

00:50:06.218 --> 00:50:07.469
What do you know about that?

00:50:09.096 --> 00:50:10.263
<i>Does anybody want a drink?</i>

00:50:10.347 --> 00:50:11.306
<i>I want a drink.</i>

00:50:11.473 --> 00:50:12.724
Keep him talking.

00:50:15.811 --> 00:50:16.895
<i>Wait, where are you going?</i>

00:50:16.978 --> 00:50:18.021
She knows Annika.

00:50:18.105 --> 00:50:19.523
No, stay on the DA.

00:50:19.606 --> 00:50:21.525
I told you I'm looking for my friend.

00:50:23.652 --> 00:50:25.779
- Where's Annika?
- Out of my face. I don't know you.

00:50:25.862 --> 00:50:26.905
Yeah, but you know her. Who took her?

00:50:26.988 --> 00:50:29.533
- What have you heard? Is she okay?
- <i>Jesus Christ, keep your voice down.</i>

00:50:29.616 --> 00:50:30.867
<i>What, you got a death wish?</i>

00:50:30.951 --> 00:50:33.412
Hey, what's the problem, ladies?

00:50:33.495 --> 00:50:36.415
There's no problem. It's just girl talk.

00:50:36.498 --> 00:50:37.999
<i>Let's keep it festive down here,
all right?</i>

00:50:38.083 --> 00:50:39.167
<i>Sure thing, Oz.</i>

00:50:43.922 --> 00:50:44.965
<i>Hey.</i>

00:50:45.549 --> 00:50:46.633
Hey.

00:50:47.801 --> 00:50:50.971
Been a long time
since I seen you down here.

00:50:52.264 --> 00:50:53.473
How you been?

00:50:55.809 --> 00:50:57.519
Yeah, I've been okay.

00:50:58.854 --> 00:51:00.230
<i>I was just...</i>

00:51:02.274 --> 00:51:04.109
I was just headed back upstairs.

00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:05.861
Well...

00:51:06.945 --> 00:51:08.613
<i>don't be a stranger.</i>

00:51:22.711 --> 00:51:25.088
- You know Carmine Falcone.
- I told you it's a mob spot.

00:51:25.172 --> 00:51:26.757
You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.

00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.633
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him, okay?</i>

00:51:28.717 --> 00:51:30.552
- Well, that's not what it looked like.
- <i>Forget it.</i>

00:51:30.635 --> 00:51:31.720
Wait, what are you doing?

00:51:31.803 --> 00:51:34.222
- <i>Listen, I can't do this anymore.</i>
- No! No!

00:51:38.810 --> 00:51:39.811
Taxi!

00:51:43.774 --> 00:51:44.775
Hey!

00:51:46.485 --> 00:51:47.569
I lost you in there.

00:51:47.652 --> 00:51:48.737
Yeah, I gotta go.

00:51:49.613 --> 00:51:51.031
Oh, you need a ride?

00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:53.033
That's me right there.

00:51:59.122 --> 00:52:00.207
Taxi!

00:52:00.290 --> 00:52:01.416
I'm good.

00:52:03.126 --> 00:52:04.544
I hope, uh...

00:52:09.132 --> 00:52:10.550
I'll see you around.

00:53:37.220 --> 00:53:41.016
Just hold still.

00:54:39.366 --> 00:54:40.283
What do you know about

00:54:40.367 --> 00:54:42.661
a confidential informant
in the Maroni case?

00:54:45.747 --> 00:54:47.457
Yeah, sure, there was.

00:54:48.166 --> 00:54:50.001
That's the rat we're looking for.

00:54:50.919 --> 00:54:52.796
Somehow Riddler knows who he is.

00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:56.383
If we find the rat,
maybe it'll lead us to him.

00:54:56.466 --> 00:54:57.926
Where are you getting this?

00:54:58.009 --> 00:55:00.887
I have a source
who spoke to the DA tonight.

00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.140
Gil's very nervous.

00:55:04.099 --> 00:55:06.643
I think the killer's targeting
people close to that case.

00:55:06.726 --> 00:55:08.603
I worked that case.

00:55:08.687 --> 00:55:10.647
Riddler's not after you.

00:55:10.730 --> 00:55:11.648
How do you know?

00:55:12.023 --> 00:55:13.442
You're not corrupt.

00:55:14.484 --> 00:55:16.027
Colson's dirty?

00:55:21.908 --> 00:55:23.410
Maybe I, uh...

00:55:24.077 --> 00:55:27.414
I go after him.
Lean on him to give up the rat.

00:55:27.497 --> 00:55:30.792
It's too dangerous.
They made a secret deal with this guy.

00:55:31.543 --> 00:55:33.336
Who knows how many people it touches.

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.631
Politicians. Police. The courts.

00:55:37.924 --> 00:55:39.634
It could tear the whole city apart.

00:55:40.051 --> 00:55:42.095
Jesus, this is a powder keg.

00:55:43.722 --> 00:55:45.474
And Riddler's the match.

00:55:46.349 --> 00:55:47.517
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

00:55:47.601 --> 00:55:48.894
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

00:55:48.977 --> 00:55:50.395
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:50.479 --> 00:55:51.980
<i>I don't have a relationship...</i>

00:55:53.023 --> 00:55:54.608
<i>You didn't tell me you had
a relationship with him.</i>

00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:56.359
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

00:55:57.486 --> 00:55:58.945
<i>You know Carmine Falcone.</i>

00:55:59.029 --> 00:56:00.072
<i>I told you it's a mob spot.</i>

00:56:00.155 --> 00:56:01.782
<i>You didn't tell me
you had a relationship with him.</i>

00:56:01.865 --> 00:56:03.700
<i>I don't have
a relationship with him. Okay?</i>

00:56:03.784 --> 00:56:05.035
Pretty.

00:56:07.037 --> 00:56:08.413
She a new friend of yours?

00:56:13.001 --> 00:56:14.211
I'm not so sure.

00:56:15.045 --> 00:56:16.546
Looks like you upset her.

00:56:17.714 --> 00:56:19.841
Shall I take this as a good sign?

00:56:19.925 --> 00:56:20.926
What?

00:56:21.009 --> 00:56:21.927
Your attire.

00:56:22.010 --> 00:56:24.137
Is Bruce Wayne making
an actual appearance?

00:56:24.221 --> 00:56:26.223
There's a public memorial
for Mayor Mitchell.

00:56:26.306 --> 00:56:28.975
Serial killers like to
follow reactions to their crimes.

00:56:30.018 --> 00:56:31.603
Riddler might not be able to resist.

00:56:31.686 --> 00:56:33.146
Oh, that reminds me.

00:56:34.314 --> 00:56:38.276
I've taken the liberty of doing
a little work on this latest cipher.

00:56:38.819 --> 00:56:40.320
The one from the rat maze.

00:56:40.737 --> 00:56:43.824
I'm afraid his Spanish is not perfect,

00:56:44.157 --> 00:56:46.034
but I'm fairly certain
this translates to,

00:56:46.118 --> 00:56:49.371
"You are <i>El Rata Alada."</i>

00:56:49.996 --> 00:56:51.415
<i>Rata Alada?</i>

00:56:51.498 --> 00:56:52.707
"Rat with wings"?

00:56:52.791 --> 00:56:55.293
It's slang for "pigeon."
Does that mean anything to you?

00:56:55.377 --> 00:56:56.628
Yeah.

00:56:58.088 --> 00:56:59.214
A stool pigeon.

00:56:59.464 --> 00:57:01.091
Where are your cufflinks?

00:57:01.174 --> 00:57:02.134
I couldn't find them.

00:57:03.593 --> 00:57:05.554
Well, you can't go out like that.

00:57:05.637 --> 00:57:07.431
Alfred, I don't want your cufflinks.

00:57:11.601 --> 00:57:14.396
You have to keep up appearances.
You're still a Wayne.

00:57:16.106 --> 00:57:18.316
And what about you? Are you a Wayne?

00:57:19.317 --> 00:57:21.111
Your father gave them to me.

00:57:26.867 --> 00:57:29.995
No more lies! No more lies!

00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.141
Mr. Wayne. All right. All right,
you're going straight down there.

00:58:03.695 --> 00:58:05.447
Is that Bruce Wayne?

00:58:05.530 --> 00:58:08.158
Mr. Wayne!
Mr. Wayne! Mr. Wayne!

00:58:17.250 --> 00:58:18.251
Hold it.

00:58:19.586 --> 00:58:20.837
You good, fellas?

00:58:21.421 --> 00:58:22.422
Good.

00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:25.634
We're good, Mr. Falcone.

00:58:43.443 --> 00:58:44.444
Sir?

00:59:04.131 --> 00:59:05.090
Hey!

00:59:05.173 --> 00:59:07.175
Give us a wide berth here,
would you, slick?

00:59:08.135 --> 00:59:09.970
Hey, watch it, fellas.

00:59:10.429 --> 00:59:12.722
You got the prince of the city there.

00:59:15.559 --> 00:59:17.394
Some event, huh?

00:59:17.477 --> 00:59:20.439
Brought out the one guy in the city
more reclusive than me.

00:59:20.522 --> 00:59:22.983
Thought you'd never leave the Shoreline.

00:59:23.066 --> 00:59:24.693
Aren't you afraid
someone'll take a shot at you?

00:59:24.776 --> 00:59:26.778
Why? 'Cause your father ain't around?

00:59:27.654 --> 00:59:29.072
Oz, you know Bruce Wayne?

00:59:29.698 --> 00:59:31.158
Wow. Is that right?

00:59:31.241 --> 00:59:33.285
His father saved my life.

00:59:34.244 --> 00:59:37.456
I got shot in the chest. Right here.

00:59:38.665 --> 00:59:42.169
I couldn't go to no hospital,
so we showed up on his doorstep.

00:59:42.461 --> 00:59:45.672
Operated right on the dining room table.

00:59:45.756 --> 00:59:51.011
Kid here, he saw the whole thing,
up on the stairs looking down.

00:59:52.429 --> 00:59:54.431
I remember your face.

00:59:56.433 --> 00:59:58.393
You don't think that meant something,
he did that?

00:59:58.769 --> 01:00:00.896
It meant he took the Hippocratic oath.

01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:03.815
"Hippocratic oath."

01:00:06.359 --> 01:00:07.569
That's good.

01:00:08.111 --> 01:00:09.279
Excuse me.

01:00:12.866 --> 01:00:13.700
Yes.

01:00:27.881 --> 01:00:28.965
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:00:29.049 --> 01:00:30.634
<i>thank you all for
coming to today's memorial</i>

01:00:30.717 --> 01:00:33.095
<i>for our beloved mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr.</i>

01:00:33.178 --> 01:00:34.971
<i>Our program will begin shortly.</i>

01:00:35.055 --> 01:00:36.473
<i>As a reminder, the family asked that</i>

01:00:36.556 --> 01:00:37.974
<i>those wishing to honor
the mayor's memory</i>

01:00:38.058 --> 01:00:39.476
<i>consider a donation to</i>

01:00:39.559 --> 01:00:41.603
<i>the cause most dear to his heart...</i>

01:00:41.686 --> 01:00:43.939
<i>...the Gotham Renewal Fund,</i>

01:00:44.022 --> 01:00:45.232
<i>our city's safety net.</i>

01:00:45.607 --> 01:00:48.151
What good's a safety net
doesn't catch anybody?

01:00:49.236 --> 01:00:52.989
Didn't help my daughter
when she needed it, I can tell you that.

01:00:53.073 --> 01:00:56.284
The guy was just another
rich scum-sucker.

01:00:57.285 --> 01:00:59.162
He got what he deserved.

01:01:01.081 --> 01:01:02.082
Know what I mean?

01:01:03.375 --> 01:01:05.502
Hey, don't I know you?

01:01:05.585 --> 01:01:06.670
Bruce Wayne.

01:01:07.587 --> 01:01:09.548
Why haven't you called me back?

01:01:09.631 --> 01:01:10.632
I'm sorry?

01:01:10.924 --> 01:01:13.260
I'm Bella Reál. I'm running for mayor.

01:01:13.343 --> 01:01:14.553
I wouldn't be bothering you here,

01:01:14.636 --> 01:01:17.305
but your people keep telling me
you're unavailable.

01:01:17.389 --> 01:01:18.723
Will you walk with me?

01:01:23.895 --> 01:01:25.230
Mr. Wayne.

01:01:25.313 --> 01:01:26.523
Mr. Wayne.

01:01:27.232 --> 01:01:30.318
You know, you really could be
doing more for this city.

01:01:30.902 --> 01:01:32.738
Your family has
a history of philanthropy,

01:01:32.821 --> 01:01:35.240
but as far as I can tell,
you're not doing anything.

01:01:35.323 --> 01:01:37.784
If I'm elected, I want to change that.

01:01:38.368 --> 01:01:39.661
Thank you.

01:01:40.537 --> 01:01:41.538
My God.

01:01:43.373 --> 01:01:45.876
I'm gonna go pay my respects.
Will you wait for me?

01:01:45.959 --> 01:01:47.586
I want to continue this.

01:01:51.798 --> 01:01:52.674
Excuse me.

01:01:54.718 --> 01:01:56.595
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:01:58.805 --> 01:01:59.723
Thank you.

01:01:59.806 --> 01:02:01.558
Excuse me, chief.
Can I talk to you?

01:02:02.893 --> 01:02:04.770
Gil Colson is missing.

01:02:04.853 --> 01:02:06.146
What?

01:02:06.229 --> 01:02:08.523
He hasn't been heard from
since last night.

01:02:08.607 --> 01:02:09.649
Christ, not again.

01:02:09.733 --> 01:02:11.818
Hey. Mr. Wayne.

01:02:14.112 --> 01:02:16.156
You got people looking for him, Jim?

01:02:16.823 --> 01:02:19.117
Sent a couple guys
to his house. Nothing.

01:02:19.201 --> 01:02:20.118
What'd his wife say?

01:02:20.202 --> 01:02:21.411
She hadn't heard from him.

01:03:16.174 --> 01:03:17.092
Get out of the car!

01:03:17.843 --> 01:03:20.053
Get out of the car and show your hands!

01:03:21.471 --> 01:03:22.681
Get out!

01:03:33.191 --> 01:03:34.484
Get 'em up!

01:03:34.568 --> 01:03:36.319
Get out! Show 'em!

01:03:40.782 --> 01:03:42.367
Christ, it's Colson.

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.161
There's a bomb around his neck!

01:03:59.217 --> 01:04:00.761
Let's clear this place out now!

01:04:00.844 --> 01:04:02.471
We've got to get this place cleared out!

01:04:36.713 --> 01:04:39.466
Hey, guys, guys. Here we go.

01:04:42.469 --> 01:04:43.887
We don't know if he's in on it.

01:04:47.015 --> 01:04:48.350
What's he looking at?

01:05:07.119 --> 01:05:08.453
Holy shit.

01:05:09.496 --> 01:05:11.164
Are you kidding me?

01:05:11.248 --> 01:05:14.000
What the hell is he doing? Gordon!

01:05:14.835 --> 01:05:17.295
Your guy's gonna
get himself killed in there.

01:05:33.061 --> 01:05:34.271
Please.

01:05:34.438 --> 01:05:37.190
- He made me do it.
- I'm so sorry.

01:05:37.607 --> 01:05:39.818
He told me if I didn't do exactly
what he said, he'd kill me.

01:05:39.901 --> 01:05:40.902
I'm so sorry.

01:05:41.403 --> 01:05:43.071
Looks like a combination lock.

01:05:43.155 --> 01:05:44.614
Can't we just cut it off?

01:05:45.365 --> 01:05:47.033
Not if you want to keep your head.

01:06:23.737 --> 01:06:24.988
<i>You came.</i>

01:06:26.823 --> 01:06:27.908
Who are you?

01:06:28.450 --> 01:06:29.451
<i>Me?</i>

01:06:31.870 --> 01:06:33.455
<i>I'm nobody.</i>

01:06:34.915 --> 01:06:37.334
<i>I'm just an instrument,</i>

01:06:37.417 --> 01:06:41.713
<i>here to unmask the truth
about this cesspool we call a city.</i>

01:06:42.255 --> 01:06:43.340
"Unmask"?

01:06:43.423 --> 01:06:44.591
<i>Yes.</i>

01:06:45.425 --> 01:06:48.261
<i>Let's do it together, okay?</i>

01:06:48.345 --> 01:06:50.764
<i>I've been trying to reach you.</i>

01:06:51.431 --> 01:06:53.767
<i>You're part of this too.</i>

01:06:53.850 --> 01:06:55.644
How am I a part of this?

01:06:55.727 --> 01:06:57.646
<i>You'll see.</i>

01:06:57.729 --> 01:06:59.481
Hey, Chief.
You better take a look at this.

01:06:59.564 --> 01:07:01.650
<i>Say hello to my followers.</i>

01:07:01.733 --> 01:07:02.984
<i>We're live.</i>

01:07:03.068 --> 01:07:06.071
<i>They're here to watch our little trial.</i>

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.448
<i>At the moment,</i>

01:07:08.532 --> 01:07:11.910
<i>the man across from you, Mr. Colson,</i>

01:07:11.993 --> 01:07:13.036
<i>is dead.</i>

01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:15.122
Jesus, can we get somebody out here?
This psycho's gonna kill me!

01:07:15.205 --> 01:07:16.164
<i>But wait a minute...</i>

01:07:16.248 --> 01:07:19.376
<i>Shut up! You deserve
to be dead after what you did!</i>

01:07:19.459 --> 01:07:22.462
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:07:22.546 --> 01:07:23.547
Okay.

01:07:32.305 --> 01:07:34.391
<i>I'm giving you a chance.</i>

01:07:36.143 --> 01:07:38.311
<i>No one ever gave me a chance.</i>

01:07:40.355 --> 01:07:41.398
<i>Now,</i>

01:07:42.399 --> 01:07:45.193
<i>ever since I was a child,</i>

01:07:45.277 --> 01:07:48.864
<i>I've always loved little puzzles.</i>

01:07:49.448 --> 01:07:51.867
<i>For me, they are a retreat</i>

01:07:51.950 --> 01:07:55.287
<i>from the horrors of our world.</i>

01:07:55.370 --> 01:08:00.584
<i>Maybe they can bring
some comfort to you too, Mr. Colson.</i>

01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.919
You want me to do puzzles?

01:08:03.003 --> 01:08:05.756
<i>Three riddles in two minutes.</i>

01:08:05.839 --> 01:08:09.926
<i>You give me the answers,
and I'll give you the code for the lock.</i>

01:08:10.010 --> 01:08:12.345
- <i>Do you understand?</i>
- Yeah.

01:08:12.429 --> 01:08:14.598
Okay, okay. So I just...

01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:15.766
You want me to...

01:08:15.891 --> 01:08:18.226
<i>Riddle number one...</i>

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:21.938
<i>"It can be cruel, poetic, or blind,</i>

01:08:22.022 --> 01:08:26.693
<i>but when it's denied,
it's violence you may find."</i>

01:08:26.777 --> 01:08:29.196
Wait, wait, wait! Can you repeat that?

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:30.363
"Cruel"? "Poetic"?

01:08:30.447 --> 01:08:31.865
- "Justice."
- Huh?

01:08:31.948 --> 01:08:32.991
The answer's "justice."

01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:34.284
- Justice?
- <i>Yes!</i>

01:08:34.367 --> 01:08:35.952
- Oh, God.
- <i>Justice!</i>

01:08:36.036 --> 01:08:40.373
<i>And you were supposed
to be an arm of justice in this city,</i>

01:08:40.457 --> 01:08:42.834
<i>along with the late mayor
and police commissioner,</i>

01:08:42.918 --> 01:08:45.295
<i>were you not, Mr. Colson?</i>

01:08:45.378 --> 01:08:46.588
Of course, of course. Of course.

01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:49.049
<i>Riddle number two.</i>

01:08:49.132 --> 01:08:53.261
<i>"If you are justice, please do not lie.</i>

01:08:53.345 --> 01:08:57.516
<i>What is the price for your blind eye?"</i>

01:08:57.599 --> 01:08:59.392
- "The price"?
- "Bribes."

01:08:59.476 --> 01:09:00.727
Oh, God. "Bribes"?

01:09:00.811 --> 01:09:02.979
He's asking you how much it cost
for you to turn your back.

01:09:04.397 --> 01:09:05.524
<i>Fifty-eight seconds!</i>

01:09:05.607 --> 01:09:06.858
- How much?
- Nothing!

01:09:06.942 --> 01:09:09.152
- How much?
- Ten grand. Ten Gs a month.

01:09:09.236 --> 01:09:11.530
I get a monthly payment
just not to prosecute certain cases.

01:09:11.613 --> 01:09:12.447
What cases?

01:09:12.531 --> 01:09:13.657
He didn't ask me that!

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:14.741
Come on! Ten grand.

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:18.161
- That's my answer. It's ten grand!
- <i>Okay. Okay. Okay.</i>

01:09:18.245 --> 01:09:20.872
<i>Don't lose your head, Mr. Colson.</i>

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:24.793
<i>Just one more to go
before your time runs out.</i>

01:09:24.876 --> 01:09:27.295
<i>Last riddle.</i>

01:09:27.379 --> 01:09:31.716
<i>"Since your justice is so select,</i>

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:36.096
<i>please tell us which vermin
you're paid to protect."</i>

01:09:36.179 --> 01:09:38.265
- "Which vermin"?
- The rat.

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:40.892
The informant you all protect
from the Salvatore Maroni case.

01:09:40.976 --> 01:09:42.769
- How do you know about that?
- What's his name?

01:09:42.853 --> 01:09:44.062
<i>Twenty seconds.</i>

01:09:44.146 --> 01:09:45.814
- No.
- He's gonna kill you.

01:09:45.897 --> 01:09:47.858
I'm a dead man either way.
You're talking to a dead man, okay?

01:09:47.941 --> 01:09:49.484
If I go out this way, it's just me.

01:09:49.568 --> 01:09:52.696
But if I give over that name,
I have family, people I love.

01:09:52.779 --> 01:09:54.239
- He'll kill them too.
- Who will?

01:09:54.322 --> 01:09:55.657
- People are watching.
- What people?

01:09:55.741 --> 01:09:57.868
It's so much bigger
than you could ever imagine.

01:09:57.951 --> 01:10:00.120
- It's the whole system!
- <i>Five!</i>

01:10:00.203 --> 01:10:01.079
<i>Four!</i>

01:10:01.163 --> 01:10:02.539
- Oh, God, have mercy on me...
- <i>Three!</i>

01:10:02.622 --> 01:10:04.499
<i>Goodbye!</i>

01:10:34.696 --> 01:10:36.073
Who do you think he is under there?

01:10:36.156 --> 01:10:36.990
Take it easy.

01:10:37.074 --> 01:10:38.075
I want to see.

01:10:39.409 --> 01:10:40.619
What is that thing? Leather?

01:10:44.372 --> 01:10:45.832
What's he got on his eyes?

01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:47.375
Who cares?
I want to see his face.

01:10:47.459 --> 01:10:48.668
What are we doing here?
Let's just take it off...

01:10:48.752 --> 01:10:49.920
Hey!

01:10:50.504 --> 01:10:53.632
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:10:53.715 --> 01:10:55.383
Relax, God damn it!

01:10:55.467 --> 01:10:56.968
You're protecting this guy, Jim?

01:10:58.386 --> 01:11:00.931
He interfered in
an active hostage situation.

01:11:01.014 --> 01:11:03.433
Colson's blood is on his hands.

01:11:03.517 --> 01:11:04.935
Maybe it's on yours.

01:11:06.394 --> 01:11:07.437
What'd you say?

01:11:07.521 --> 01:11:09.106
He would rather die than talk.

01:11:09.689 --> 01:11:11.191
What was he afraid of?

01:11:11.942 --> 01:11:13.026
You?

01:11:20.158 --> 01:11:21.576
You son of a bitch.

01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:25.163
You have any idea
what kind of trouble you're in?

01:11:25.247 --> 01:11:26.957
You could be an accessory to murder.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.041
Why are we playing games...

01:11:30.168 --> 01:11:31.044
Get him! Come on!

01:11:31.128 --> 01:11:33.130
Back off! Back off!

01:11:33.213 --> 01:11:35.507
Great, now I got you
on assaulting an officer!

01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:37.676
- You got me on assaulting three.
- Hey!

01:11:37.759 --> 01:11:40.554
What's the matter with you?
This isn't the way to do this!

01:11:43.223 --> 01:11:44.766
You too now?

01:11:44.850 --> 01:11:47.394
Let me handle this, Chief.
Just give me a minute.

01:11:47.477 --> 01:11:50.063
You're gonna put yourself on the line
for this scumbag, Jim?

01:11:50.147 --> 01:11:52.399
Just give me a minute.
I'll get him to cooperate.

01:11:55.193 --> 01:11:56.695
Okay, give him the room.

01:12:12.335 --> 01:12:13.628
Two minutes.

01:12:25.390 --> 01:12:26.975
You listen to me.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:30.562
We gotta get you out of here.

01:12:32.230 --> 01:12:34.191
That would put a lot of heat on you.

01:12:34.274 --> 01:12:35.942
Well, you punched me in the face.

01:12:38.195 --> 01:12:39.488
Take this key.

01:12:40.781 --> 01:12:44.159
Through that door. Hallway to the stairs
that go to the roof.

01:12:45.202 --> 01:12:46.912
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

01:12:47.913 --> 01:12:50.207
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

01:12:53.585 --> 01:12:55.962
Who's the mustache with the broken nose?

01:12:59.382 --> 01:13:02.094
That's Kenzie. Narcotics.

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:05.097
He's one of the guys I got into it with
at the Iceberg Lounge.

01:13:06.014 --> 01:13:08.642
What are you saying?
Kenzie moonlights for the Penguin?

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:13.313
Or he moonlights as a cop.

01:13:17.901 --> 01:13:19.403
- Jesus Christ!
- Go!

01:13:19.486 --> 01:13:20.987
Somebody stop him!

01:13:59.192 --> 01:14:00.736
- There he is!
- Freeze!

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:49.034
Could have at least
pulled that punch, man.

01:14:49.576 --> 01:14:50.786
I did.

01:14:50.869 --> 01:14:54.247
Bock put out an APB on you.
You really think he's in on this?

01:14:54.331 --> 01:14:56.374
I don't trust any of 'em. Do you?

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:57.584
I only trust you.

01:14:57.667 --> 01:15:00.003
What's a narcotics cop doing
with Falcone's right-hand man?

01:15:00.087 --> 01:15:03.465
Colson said, "Cops protect the rat."
Maybe Kenzie's part of it.

01:15:04.216 --> 01:15:05.342
You think Penguin's the rat?

01:15:05.425 --> 01:15:08.470
His club caters to the mob.
Maroni practically lived there.

01:15:08.553 --> 01:15:10.514
Penguin would have been
privy to a lot of dirt.

01:15:10.597 --> 01:15:11.932
DA was a regular too.

01:15:12.015 --> 01:15:15.519
Maybe Penguin got himself into a jam
and working a deal was his only way out.

01:15:16.603 --> 01:15:17.813
The <i>Rata Alada.</i>

01:15:17.896 --> 01:15:18.855
The what?

01:15:18.939 --> 01:15:20.398
Riddler's latest.

01:15:20.482 --> 01:15:22.192
The cipher in the maze.

01:15:22.275 --> 01:15:24.778
It means "a rat with wings."
Like a stool pigeon.

01:15:26.363 --> 01:15:27.989
A penguin's got wings too.

01:15:29.991 --> 01:15:31.952
Time for me
to have another conversation with him.

01:15:32.035 --> 01:15:33.703
What about the Riddler?
He's gonna kill again.

01:15:33.787 --> 01:15:36.998
It's all connected.
Like it or not, it's his game now.

01:15:37.082 --> 01:15:40.252
You want to find Riddler,
we gotta find that rat.

01:15:42.879 --> 01:15:44.714
<i>Kenzie and the twins, coming your way.</i>

01:15:45.882 --> 01:15:46.967
There's Penguin.

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:48.927
<i>I wonder what's in the bags.</i>

01:15:50.554 --> 01:15:51.805
<i>You want to move in?</i>

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.142
<i>Let's follow.</i>

01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:17.205
They stopped at Waterfront Street.
The recycling plant.

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:18.582
<i>I'm here.</i>

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.668
- How you doing?
- Yeah, good. How are you?

01:16:21.752 --> 01:16:24.254
Good, good.
Let's get in out of this deluge.

01:16:43.482 --> 01:16:46.026
It's a drug lab. Drops.

01:16:46.109 --> 01:16:47.319
This is a buy.

01:16:47.402 --> 01:16:50.572
Looks like they got Maroni's operation
up and running again.

01:16:50.655 --> 01:16:51.823
Or they never shut it down at all.

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:52.783
<i>What are you saying?</i>

01:16:52.866 --> 01:16:55.994
The biggest drug bust in GCPD history
was a fraud?

01:17:20.352 --> 01:17:21.770
This just got complicated.

01:17:22.521 --> 01:17:23.688
What do you mean?

01:17:29.611 --> 01:17:31.071
Hey! What happened?

01:17:31.154 --> 01:17:32.489
You all right?

01:17:43.208 --> 01:17:45.001
Dangerous crowd you're stealing from.

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:46.753
Jesus.

01:17:47.504 --> 01:17:49.339
Is this how you get your kicks, hon?

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:51.174
Sneaking up on girls in the dark?

01:17:51.258 --> 01:17:52.968
Is that why you work in the club?

01:17:53.718 --> 01:17:54.761
It was all just a score?

01:17:54.845 --> 01:17:58.640
I would love to sit and go over
every gory detail with you, bat boy...

01:18:00.016 --> 01:18:01.935
but, uh, those assholes are coming back.

01:18:13.238 --> 01:18:14.197
Jesus!

01:18:42.809 --> 01:18:43.935
Hey, Vengeance!

01:18:46.104 --> 01:18:48.815
You think you can
come after my money, huh?

01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:31.316
Kenzie! Get the money!

01:19:36.738 --> 01:19:37.989
Hey! What the...

01:20:28.623 --> 01:20:29.958
Whoa!

01:20:33.170 --> 01:20:34.755
Come on! Come on!

01:20:37.924 --> 01:20:39.259
This guy's crazy!

01:20:41.011 --> 01:20:42.721
Come on! Hey!

01:21:32.187 --> 01:21:33.188
Move!

01:22:38.003 --> 01:22:39.880
Get out of the way!

01:22:51.016 --> 01:22:52.100
Come on!

01:23:00.817 --> 01:23:01.943
Get out of the way!

01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:41.233
I got you!

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:43.819
I got you!

01:23:43.902 --> 01:23:46.238
Take that, you friggin' psycho!

01:23:46.321 --> 01:23:47.781
I got you!

01:25:04.232 --> 01:25:07.069
What the hell is this?
Good cop, batshit cop?

01:25:07.152 --> 01:25:09.780
- Who's the Riddler?
- Riddler? How should I know?

01:25:09.863 --> 01:25:11.156
Let's make it easy for you, Oz.

01:25:11.239 --> 01:25:12.657
Cops caught you doing something.

01:25:12.741 --> 01:25:14.367
They were gonna shut you down,
put you away.

01:25:14.451 --> 01:25:16.328
So you gave up a bigger fish
to save your ass.

01:25:16.411 --> 01:25:18.538
You ratted out Salvatore Maroni.

01:25:18.622 --> 01:25:19.831
His drops operation.

01:25:19.915 --> 01:25:22.375
But the cops, the city officials,
the mayor, the DA,

01:25:22.459 --> 01:25:26.088
they got greedy, right?
Wasn't enough, a big career-making bust.

01:25:26.171 --> 01:25:27.923
They wanted to take over
the drops business too,

01:25:28.006 --> 01:25:30.342
but they needed a minor league mope
like you to run it.

01:25:30.425 --> 01:25:33.637
You don't just work for Carmine Falcone.
You work for them too.

01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:34.888
What are you, crazy?

01:25:34.971 --> 01:25:36.056
That why you killed the girl?

01:25:36.139 --> 01:25:37.099
I didn't kill no girl!

01:25:37.182 --> 01:25:38.975
We know she worked for you
at the 44 Below.

01:25:39.059 --> 01:25:40.352
But she got too close, right?

01:25:40.435 --> 01:25:42.646
Found out from Mitchell that you were
the rat, so you killed her.

01:25:42.729 --> 01:25:44.689
But somehow Riddler found out too.

01:25:44.773 --> 01:25:46.691
He knows so much about you.

01:25:46.775 --> 01:25:48.819
- You must know about him.
- Who is he?

01:25:49.403 --> 01:25:51.613
Boy, you guys are a hell of a duet here.

01:25:52.030 --> 01:25:53.198
Why don't you start harmonizing?

01:25:53.532 --> 01:25:56.201
There's only one problem
with your little scenario, okay?

01:25:56.284 --> 01:25:57.619
I ain't no rat!

01:25:57.702 --> 01:25:59.538
You got any idea what Carmine Falcone
would do to me

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:00.705
if he heard this kind of talk?

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:02.958
Oh, you don't wanna
talk about rats, huh?

01:26:03.041 --> 01:26:05.585
Maybe we can talk about
what they did to my partner's face.

01:26:05.669 --> 01:26:07.212
Holy God, what are you showing me here?

01:26:07.295 --> 01:26:08.922
- This was around his head!
- Come on!

01:26:09.005 --> 01:26:10.924
Open your eyes!

01:26:14.845 --> 01:26:16.430
Are you <i>El Rata Alada?</i>

01:26:16.513 --> 01:26:18.014
<i>El Rata Alada?</i>

01:26:18.098 --> 01:26:19.933
Yeah, a "rat with wings."
A stool pigeon.

01:26:20.016 --> 01:26:22.352
That's not you?
The symbols in the maze, right here.

01:26:22.436 --> 01:26:25.021
It says you are <i>El Rata Alada.</i>

01:26:25.105 --> 01:26:26.481
"You are <i>El Rata"?</i> It says that?

01:26:26.565 --> 01:26:27.774
Why, you got something to tell us?

01:26:27.858 --> 01:26:28.734
Yeah!

01:26:29.401 --> 01:26:30.444
It's, like, the worst Spanish
I ever heard.

01:26:30.527 --> 01:26:31.361
What?

01:26:31.778 --> 01:26:33.113
It's <i>"La."</i>

01:26:33.196 --> 01:26:34.489
<i>"La" rata.</i>

01:26:34.990 --> 01:26:36.992
What, is this Riddler stupid
or something?

01:26:37.075 --> 01:26:38.952
Jesus! Look at you two.

01:26:39.369 --> 01:26:41.621
World's greatest detectives!

01:26:42.038 --> 01:26:44.332
Am I the only here knows the difference
between <i>"el"</i> and <i>"la"?</i>

01:26:44.416 --> 01:26:45.500
Jesus!

01:26:45.584 --> 01:26:47.085
<i>No habla español,</i> fellas?

01:26:47.169 --> 01:26:49.171
Do me a favor, shithead, shut up!

01:26:50.589 --> 01:26:51.673
You think he made a mistake?

01:26:51.757 --> 01:26:52.966
He doesn't make mistakes.

01:26:53.049 --> 01:26:54.092
A rat with wings?

01:26:54.176 --> 01:26:55.761
You know what that sounds like to me?

01:26:55.844 --> 01:26:59.014
A friggin' bat! Huh?
You ever think of that?

01:26:59.097 --> 01:27:01.099
"You are <i>El Rata."</i>

01:27:06.730 --> 01:27:10.609
"You are <i>el."</i>

01:27:19.284 --> 01:27:20.786
Maybe it was a mistake.

01:27:21.203 --> 01:27:22.037
Maybe he isn't as smart as...

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:22.954
Wait.

01:27:26.374 --> 01:27:27.709
Is that him?

01:27:28.585 --> 01:27:30.420
Holy shit.

01:27:50.315 --> 01:27:51.900
What the hell does that mean?
Is he or isn't he?

01:28:21.304 --> 01:28:24.933
"I grew up from a seed, tough as a weed.

01:28:25.016 --> 01:28:27.853
But in a mansion, in a slum,

01:28:27.936 --> 01:28:29.855
I'll never know where I come from.

01:28:30.730 --> 01:28:32.065
Do you know what I am?"

01:28:32.149 --> 01:28:33.150
Any idea?

01:28:33.692 --> 01:28:34.693
Yeah.

01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:37.362
It's an orphan.

01:28:46.246 --> 01:28:47.998
A mansion in a slum.

01:28:49.541 --> 01:28:52.127
- He's talking about the old orphanage.
- The one that burned down?

01:28:52.210 --> 01:28:53.920
It was part of the Wayne estate.

01:28:54.546 --> 01:28:56.131
They donated it
after they built the tower.

01:28:56.214 --> 01:28:57.048
Let's go.

01:29:00.302 --> 01:29:02.763
You guys realize I'm still here, right?

01:29:03.805 --> 01:29:05.182
You gonna untie me?

01:29:05.265 --> 01:29:06.725
How the hell
am I supposed to get out of here?

01:29:10.645 --> 01:29:11.646
Hey!

01:29:13.106 --> 01:29:15.525
You goddamn sons of bitches!

01:29:29.623 --> 01:29:31.792
No guns.

01:29:33.251 --> 01:29:35.295
Yeah, man. That's your thing.

01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.609
What's that?

01:30:08.120 --> 01:30:10.038
Hey! Hey!

01:30:16.503 --> 01:30:17.712
Dropheads.

01:30:25.137 --> 01:30:26.763
What the hell is that?

01:30:38.525 --> 01:30:40.902
<i>Thank you. Thank you so much.</i>

01:30:40.986 --> 01:30:42.279
<i>Wasn't that beautiful?</i>

01:30:45.031 --> 01:30:47.075
<i>Thank you all. Thank you, uh...</i>

01:30:47.492 --> 01:30:49.077
<i>Thank you for coming today.</i>

01:30:50.829 --> 01:30:52.414
<i>I believe in Gotham.</i>

01:30:53.707 --> 01:30:55.500
<i>I believe in its promise.</i>

01:30:56.710 --> 01:31:00.172
<i>But too many have been left behind
for too long,</i>

01:31:00.714 --> 01:31:02.507
<i>and that's why I'm here today.</i>

01:31:02.591 --> 01:31:05.427
<i>To announce,
not only my candidacy for mayor,</i>

01:31:05.510 --> 01:31:08.847
<i>but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund.</i>

01:31:09.389 --> 01:31:11.266
<i>Win or lose,</i>

01:31:11.349 --> 01:31:14.144
<i>the Wayne Foundation pledges
a $1 billion donation</i>

01:31:14.603 --> 01:31:17.439
<i>to start a charitable endowment
for public works.</i>

01:31:18.023 --> 01:31:22.069
<i>I want to bypass political gridlock,
and get money to people and projects</i>

01:31:22.152 --> 01:31:24.071
<i>who need it now,</i>

01:31:24.154 --> 01:31:25.614
<i>like these children behind me.</i>

01:31:25.697 --> 01:31:27.115
"Sins of the father."

01:31:27.199 --> 01:31:29.659
<i>Renewal is about growth.
It is about planting seeds...</i>

01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:34.206
<i>...and renewing Gotham's promise.</i>

01:31:38.085 --> 01:31:40.295
Shall be visited upon the son.

01:31:42.297 --> 01:31:45.425
Jesus. His next victim is Bruce Wayne.

01:31:50.013 --> 01:31:51.431
Hey!

01:32:51.116 --> 01:32:53.660
- Hello?
- Dory! I need to speak to Alfred!

01:32:53.744 --> 01:32:55.579
- <i>Oh, Mr. Wayne...</i>
- Listen to me!

01:32:55.662 --> 01:32:57.289
Something terrible is gonna happen!

01:32:57.956 --> 01:33:00.041
I'm afraid it already has, sir.

01:33:11.845 --> 01:33:13.597
<i>About an hour ago.</i>

01:33:14.765 --> 01:33:16.433
I'm so sorry.

01:33:17.893 --> 01:33:19.644
I've been trying to reach you.

01:33:22.397 --> 01:33:24.065
<i>The package was intended for you.</i>

01:33:24.608 --> 01:33:28.361
It was a C-4 explosive sent in a mailer.
We found this too.

01:33:51.093 --> 01:33:52.719
We've sedated him.

01:33:52.803 --> 01:33:54.429
We just have to hope he stabilizes.

01:33:55.305 --> 01:33:58.016
You should go home, Mr. Wayne.
Get some sleep.

01:33:58.558 --> 01:34:00.310
Is there anyone else to notify?

01:34:01.645 --> 01:34:03.063
Next of kin?

01:34:08.193 --> 01:34:09.277
No.

01:34:10.404 --> 01:34:12.030
It's just me.

01:35:55.133 --> 01:35:56.384
Selina?

01:36:03.016 --> 01:36:04.017
<i>Can you see me?</i>

01:36:07.145 --> 01:36:09.564
- Yeah, I can see you.
- <i>I need to talk to you.</i>

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:11.525
<i>Where can we go?</i>

01:36:30.210 --> 01:36:32.129
Cat burglar pulling another score?

01:36:33.213 --> 01:36:35.674
- What?
- Wasn't sure I'd see you again.

01:36:35.757 --> 01:36:38.218
Yeah, well, things were getting
a little hot for me, so...

01:36:38.885 --> 01:36:40.637
How could they do that to her?

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:42.681
That piece of shit cop, Kenzie.

01:36:42.764 --> 01:36:44.683
Her body was in his car.

01:36:44.766 --> 01:36:47.644
I'm gonna find him and I'm gonna
make him pay. You gonna help me?

01:36:47.727 --> 01:36:50.730
- Help you?
- Yeah. I thought you were "Vengeance."

01:36:50.814 --> 01:36:52.357
Your friend got involved
with the wrong people.

01:36:52.441 --> 01:36:54.067
She didn't know any better.

01:36:54.151 --> 01:36:55.485
Maybe you should have
explained it to her.

01:36:55.569 --> 01:36:57.112
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

01:36:57.195 --> 01:36:58.697
It means your choices have consequences.

01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.158
Jesus Christ. "Choices"?

01:37:01.241 --> 01:37:03.952
You know, whoever the hell you are,
you obviously grew up rich.

01:37:04.035 --> 01:37:05.871
- Was it worth it?
- What?

01:37:06.204 --> 01:37:08.373
Compromising yourself for money?

01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:12.002
What did you have to do
to set up that score?

01:37:13.628 --> 01:37:17.299
How close did you have to get
to Penguin? To Falcone?

01:37:17.382 --> 01:37:18.717
You don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:20.135
Falcone owes me that money.

01:37:20.218 --> 01:37:21.970
- He owes you?
- Yeah, and a lot more.

01:37:22.053 --> 01:37:22.888
Oh, really? Why's that?

01:37:22.971 --> 01:37:23.889
You know what? I can't even talk to you.

01:37:23.972 --> 01:37:25.724
No! I want to know
why a guy like Falcone

01:37:25.807 --> 01:37:26.808
would owe you anything.

01:37:26.892 --> 01:37:29.227
Because he's my father!

01:37:38.361 --> 01:37:41.156
My mother worked at the 44 Below.

01:37:42.657 --> 01:37:43.950
Just like Anni.

01:37:46.119 --> 01:37:48.663
She used to take me there
when I was a little girl.

01:37:50.749 --> 01:37:52.084
To the club?

01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:54.002
Yeah.

01:37:56.713 --> 01:37:59.591
I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked.

01:38:00.050 --> 01:38:01.802
Used to see him there.

01:38:02.552 --> 01:38:04.554
He scared the shit out of me.

01:38:06.515 --> 01:38:09.976
And I could never understand
why he looked at me the way he did.

01:38:10.519 --> 01:38:14.356
Then one night,
my mother told me who he was.

01:38:17.734 --> 01:38:20.070
When I was seven,
my mother was murdered.

01:38:20.737 --> 01:38:22.239
Strangled.

01:38:22.656 --> 01:38:26.118
Never found out who.
Probably some creep from the club.

01:38:27.994 --> 01:38:30.080
Anyway, social services
came to take me away,

01:38:30.163 --> 01:38:32.332
and he didn't say a thing.

01:38:34.167 --> 01:38:35.961
Couldn't even look at me.

01:38:39.714 --> 01:38:41.466
He owes me that money.

01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.678
I'm sorry.

01:38:45.804 --> 01:38:46.972
For what I said.

01:38:48.348 --> 01:38:49.766
Oh, it's all right.

01:38:53.311 --> 01:38:55.397
You assume the worst in people.

01:38:56.314 --> 01:38:57.691
Which, well...

01:38:59.985 --> 01:39:01.903
maybe we're not so different after all.

01:39:07.367 --> 01:39:09.119
Who are you under there?

01:39:15.208 --> 01:39:17.085
What are you hiding?

01:39:19.463 --> 01:39:21.298
Are you just...

01:39:22.883 --> 01:39:24.593
hideously scarred?

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:27.721
Yeah.

01:39:34.978 --> 01:39:36.396
Listen to me.

01:39:37.939 --> 01:39:40.817
If we don't stand up for Annika,
no one will.

01:39:41.985 --> 01:39:46.656
All anyone cares about in this place
are these white, privileged assholes.

01:39:47.282 --> 01:39:50.368
The mayor, the commissioner, the DA.

01:39:50.452 --> 01:39:51.703
Now Thomas and Bruce Wayne.

01:39:51.787 --> 01:39:53.038
I mean, as far as I'm concerned,

01:39:53.121 --> 01:39:55.165
that psycho's right
to go after these creeps.

01:39:55.248 --> 01:39:56.500
I think you'd be on his side.

01:39:56.583 --> 01:39:58.210
What do you mean,
"Thomas and Bruce Wayne"?

01:39:58.293 --> 01:40:00.253
What, do you live in a cave?

01:40:00.337 --> 01:40:02.422
The Riddler's latest.
It's all about the Waynes.

01:40:03.507 --> 01:40:07.385
Listen, if I can find
that dickbag Kenzie,

01:40:07.469 --> 01:40:08.678
will you help me?

01:40:09.930 --> 01:40:11.223
Please.

01:40:14.017 --> 01:40:15.936
Come on, Vengeance.

01:40:18.396 --> 01:40:20.649
Just don't make any moves without me,
understand?

01:40:20.732 --> 01:40:22.359
It's a little more dangerous
than you know...

01:40:31.910 --> 01:40:33.453
I told you, baby.

01:40:35.372 --> 01:40:37.958
I can take care of myself.

01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:52.055
<i>I'm Thomas Wayne,
and I approve this message.</i>

01:40:59.896 --> 01:41:03.483
<i>From a very young age, my family,
Martha's family, the Arkhams...</i>

01:41:03.608 --> 01:41:05.444
<i>...instilled in both of us</i>

01:41:05.652 --> 01:41:08.071
<i>that giving back
is not just an obligation,</i>

01:41:08.238 --> 01:41:09.698
<i>it's a passion.</i>

01:41:10.407 --> 01:41:12.743
<i>That is our family's legacy.</i>

01:41:13.952 --> 01:41:16.288
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams.</i>

01:41:16.371 --> 01:41:18.832
<i>Gotham's founding families.</i>

01:41:18.915 --> 01:41:22.085
<i>But what is their real legacy?</i>

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:28.091
<i>Twenty years ago, one reporter set out
to uncover the dark truth.</i>

01:41:28.175 --> 01:41:31.845
<i>He found shocking family secrets.</i>

01:41:32.554 --> 01:41:34.097
<i>How, when Martha was just a child,</i>

01:41:34.181 --> 01:41:36.683
<i>her mother brutally murdered her father,</i>

01:41:36.767 --> 01:41:38.393
<i>then committed suicide...</i>

01:41:38.477 --> 01:41:44.065
<i>...and how the Arkhams used their power
and money to cover it up.</i>

01:41:44.149 --> 01:41:48.820
<i>How Martha herself was
in and out of institutions for years</i>

01:41:48.904 --> 01:41:51.281
<i>and they didn't want anyone to know.</i>

01:41:52.115 --> 01:41:54.618
<i>Thomas Wayne tried
to force this crusading reporter</i>

01:41:54.701 --> 01:41:58.622
<i>into a hush-money agreement
to save his mayoral campaign.</i>

01:41:58.747 --> 01:42:00.791
<i>But when the reporter refused...</i>

01:42:01.291 --> 01:42:05.587
<i>...Wayne turned to longtime
secret associate Carmine Falcone</i>

01:42:05.670 --> 01:42:08.256
<i>and had him murdered!</i>

01:42:08.381 --> 01:42:11.426
<i>The Waynes and the Arkhams,</i>

01:42:12.010 --> 01:42:17.265
<i>Gotham's legacy of lies and murder.</i>

01:42:17.766 --> 01:42:20.143
<i>I hope you're listening, Bruce Wayne.</i>

01:42:20.227 --> 01:42:22.604
<i>This is your legacy too.</i>

01:42:22.687 --> 01:42:26.149
<i>And Gotham needs you to answer</i>

01:42:26.233 --> 01:42:29.027
<i>for the sins of your father.</i>

01:42:30.570 --> 01:42:32.406
<i>Goodbye.</i>

01:42:38.161 --> 01:42:39.246
Do you know who I am?

01:42:40.872 --> 01:42:41.998
You're Bruce Wayne.

01:42:42.082 --> 01:42:43.959
I wanna see Carmine Falcone.

01:42:54.719 --> 01:42:55.720
See?

01:43:07.023 --> 01:43:09.651
Who is this guy
who invented the ball, right?

01:43:10.402 --> 01:43:12.529
Must have made a fortune.

01:43:12.988 --> 01:43:14.740
If you think about it,
the concept of it, right?

01:43:16.241 --> 01:43:18.702
Briscoe, do you know
how much this sweater cost?

01:43:18.785 --> 01:43:19.786
No, boss.

01:43:19.870 --> 01:43:22.205
$1,183.

01:43:22.789 --> 01:43:24.750
You know why communism failed, right?

01:43:24.833 --> 01:43:25.834
No, boss.

01:43:27.753 --> 01:43:29.004
Austerity.

01:43:31.256 --> 01:43:32.883
All right. All right.

01:43:33.175 --> 01:43:35.552
Look at that. Perfect.

01:43:35.635 --> 01:43:37.387
It's never gonna be that good again.

01:43:39.598 --> 01:43:42.100
Hey, Johnny Slick.

01:43:42.184 --> 01:43:43.351
What are you doing here?

01:43:45.270 --> 01:43:47.105
Give us a moment here, fellas.

01:43:48.023 --> 01:43:49.065
Come on.

01:43:50.984 --> 01:43:52.194
See ya, champ.

01:43:53.195 --> 01:43:54.446
Come on, sweetheart.

01:43:56.406 --> 01:43:57.407
Have a seat.

01:43:59.451 --> 01:44:01.244
I thought I might hear from you.

01:44:02.412 --> 01:44:05.540
This, uh,
Riddler son of a bitch is really...

01:44:07.084 --> 01:44:08.877
stirring things up, huh?

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:10.670
- Is it true?
- What?

01:44:11.963 --> 01:44:13.590
That reporter business?

01:44:14.925 --> 01:44:16.134
What do you want to know here, kid?

01:44:16.218 --> 01:44:19.012
Did you kill him? For my father?

01:44:19.096 --> 01:44:21.848
Look, your father was in trouble.

01:44:22.724 --> 01:44:24.518
This reporter had some dirt.

01:44:24.601 --> 01:44:26.228
Some very...

01:44:27.395 --> 01:44:31.149
personal stuff about your mother,
her family history.

01:44:31.233 --> 01:44:33.944
Everybody's got their dirty laundry,
that's just how it is.

01:44:34.027 --> 01:44:35.487
But he didn't want
none of it coming out,

01:44:35.570 --> 01:44:37.489
not right before the election.

01:44:37.948 --> 01:44:40.242
And your father tried
to pay the guy off,

01:44:40.325 --> 01:44:41.952
but he wasn't going for it.

01:44:42.035 --> 01:44:45.205
So, he came to me.

01:44:45.288 --> 01:44:47.666
Well, I never seen him like that.

01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:50.335
He said, "Carmine,

01:44:51.128 --> 01:44:55.841
I want you to put the fear of God
in this guy."

01:44:58.260 --> 01:45:01.179
And when fear isn't enough...

01:45:01.847 --> 01:45:03.682
Oof. Hmm.

01:45:05.016 --> 01:45:08.353
Your father wanted me to handle it,
so I did.

01:45:09.354 --> 01:45:11.189
I handled it.

01:45:12.899 --> 01:45:14.317
I know.

01:45:14.401 --> 01:45:16.653
You thought your father was a Boy Scout.

01:45:17.904 --> 01:45:19.740
But you'd be surprised

01:45:19.823 --> 01:45:22.200
what even a good man like him

01:45:22.284 --> 01:45:24.870
is capable of in the right situation.

01:45:27.122 --> 01:45:28.582
Do me a favor.

01:45:28.915 --> 01:45:30.959
Don't lose any sleep over it.

01:45:31.668 --> 01:45:33.253
This reporter

01:45:34.087 --> 01:45:35.672
was a lowlife.

01:45:35.756 --> 01:45:37.215
He was on Maroni's payroll.

01:45:38.842 --> 01:45:40.469
- Maroni?
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:41.219 --> 01:45:44.473
He could never stand
your father and I had history.

01:45:45.891 --> 01:45:49.394
And after what happened
with that reporter, Maroni was worried

01:45:49.478 --> 01:45:51.813
that your father would be in my pocket,

01:45:52.564 --> 01:45:53.565
forever.

01:45:54.232 --> 01:45:56.276
He would have done anything

01:45:56.359 --> 01:45:58.528
to keep him from becoming mayor.

01:45:58.612 --> 01:45:59.946
You understand?

01:46:01.156 --> 01:46:05.702
Are you saying Salvatore Maroni
got my father killed?

01:46:05.786 --> 01:46:07.829
Do I know it for a fact?

01:46:10.248 --> 01:46:12.334
I'm just saying,
it sure looked that way to me.

01:46:13.710 --> 01:46:16.004
This is what you wanted, huh?

01:46:16.088 --> 01:46:18.507
This little conversation here?

01:46:20.926 --> 01:46:23.095
It's been a long time coming, huh?

01:46:25.722 --> 01:46:27.849
I mean, you ain't a kid no more.

01:47:37.252 --> 01:47:38.545
You lied to me...

01:47:41.381 --> 01:47:43.008
my whole life.

01:47:48.180 --> 01:47:50.223
I spoke to Carmine Falcone.

01:47:53.310 --> 01:47:56.605
He told me what he did for my father.

01:48:00.609 --> 01:48:02.110
About Salvatore Maroni.

01:48:04.112 --> 01:48:06.823
He told you Salvatore Maroni...

01:48:06.907 --> 01:48:08.658
Had my father killed.

01:48:11.119 --> 01:48:13.330
Why didn't you tell me all this?

01:48:16.083 --> 01:48:20.629
All these years
I've spent fighting for him,

01:48:20.712 --> 01:48:23.048
believing that he was a good man.

01:48:23.131 --> 01:48:24.716
He was a good man.

01:48:25.884 --> 01:48:27.594
You listen to me.

01:48:27.677 --> 01:48:31.098
Your father was a good man.

01:48:34.726 --> 01:48:36.645
- He made a mistake.
- A "mistake."

01:48:36.728 --> 01:48:38.647
He had a man killed.

01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:39.815
Why?

01:48:40.982 --> 01:48:44.236
To protect his family image?

01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:46.571
His political aspirations?

01:48:46.655 --> 01:48:50.200
It wasn't to protect the family image,
and he didn't have anyone killed.

01:48:52.786 --> 01:48:54.329
He was protecting your mother.

01:48:55.288 --> 01:48:58.834
He didn't care about his image
or the campaign, any of that.

01:48:58.917 --> 01:49:01.044
He cared about her,

01:49:01.128 --> 01:49:02.421
and you,

01:49:02.504 --> 01:49:05.424
and in a moment of weakness,
he turned to Falcone.

01:49:05.507 --> 01:49:08.969
But he never thought Falcone
would kill that man.

01:49:09.845 --> 01:49:13.181
Your father should have known
that Falcone would do anything

01:49:13.265 --> 01:49:16.393
to finally have something on him
that he could use.

01:49:16.476 --> 01:49:18.311
That's who Falcone is.

01:49:20.564 --> 01:49:22.774
And that was your father's mistake.

01:49:22.858 --> 01:49:24.901
But when Falcone
told him what he'd done,

01:49:24.985 --> 01:49:27.738
your father was distraught.

01:49:28.613 --> 01:49:31.825
He told Falcone
he was going to the police,

01:49:31.908 --> 01:49:34.077
that he would confess everything.

01:49:35.579 --> 01:49:37.581
And that night,

01:49:37.664 --> 01:49:41.585
your father and your mother were killed.

01:49:47.090 --> 01:49:48.842
It was Falcone?

01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:57.017
Oh, I wish I knew for sure.

01:50:01.730 --> 01:50:05.275
Or maybe it was some random thug
on the street

01:50:05.358 --> 01:50:08.111
who needed money, got scared,
and pulled the trigger too fast.

01:50:08.195 --> 01:50:13.408
If you don't think I've spent every day
searching for that answer...

01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:19.039
It was my job to protect them.
Do you understand?

01:50:19.706 --> 01:50:21.500
I know you always blamed yourself.

01:50:21.583 --> 01:50:24.127
You were only a boy, Bruce.

01:50:26.296 --> 01:50:28.590
I could see the fear in your eyes,

01:50:30.008 --> 01:50:32.385
but I didn't know how to help.

01:50:32.469 --> 01:50:34.971
I could teach you how to fight,

01:50:36.348 --> 01:50:39.017
but I wasn't equipped
to take care of you.

01:50:39.101 --> 01:50:40.936
You needed a father.

01:50:42.896 --> 01:50:45.315
And all you had was me.

01:50:47.692 --> 01:50:48.902
I'm sorry.

01:50:50.654 --> 01:50:52.572
Don't be sorry, Alfred.

01:50:59.371 --> 01:51:00.455
God.

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:07.921
I never thought
I'd feel fear like that again.

01:51:10.632 --> 01:51:12.759
I thought I'd mastered all that.

01:51:19.182 --> 01:51:20.434
I mean,

01:51:21.643 --> 01:51:23.770
I'm not afraid to die.

01:51:25.522 --> 01:51:27.899
I realize now there's something

01:51:29.025 --> 01:51:30.902
I haven't got past.

01:51:31.820 --> 01:51:33.572
This fear...

01:51:36.032 --> 01:51:38.994
of ever going through any of that again.

01:51:43.248 --> 01:51:45.459
Of losing somebody I care about.

01:52:36.051 --> 01:52:37.010
Hey.

01:52:37.094 --> 01:52:39.846
I saw the signal. That's not you?

01:52:39.930 --> 01:52:41.848
I thought it was you.

01:52:54.778 --> 01:52:56.321
- I found him!
- I see that.

01:52:56.405 --> 01:52:57.906
He had my shit and my phone.

01:52:57.989 --> 01:52:59.199
She left a message
the night they took her.

01:52:59.282 --> 01:53:00.200
She called me...

01:53:00.283 --> 01:53:01.993
Gordon! Help me out, man!

01:53:02.077 --> 01:53:03.370
She got my gun!

01:53:04.704 --> 01:53:06.415
- Shut up!
- Put the gun down.

01:53:07.958 --> 01:53:10.502
I'm telling you, God damn it!
She called me!

01:53:15.090 --> 01:53:17.175
Here. Listen.

01:53:19.136 --> 01:53:20.804
<i>Hey! Get back here!</i>

01:53:20.929 --> 01:53:23.098
<i>Where you going? Come back here!</i>

01:53:23.181 --> 01:53:25.267
<i>Hey, hey,
what are you doing, Kenzie?</i>

01:53:25.350 --> 01:53:26.685
<i>You're scaring her.</i>

01:53:26.768 --> 01:53:28.478
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone.</i>

01:53:28.562 --> 01:53:29.604
<i>Please, please, please.</i>

01:53:29.688 --> 01:53:30.981
<i>Please, don't hurt me, please.</i>

01:53:31.064 --> 01:53:33.734
<i>Hey, don't be scared. Come here.</i>

01:53:35.610 --> 01:53:37.654
<i>Now let me ask you again.</i>

01:53:38.363 --> 01:53:40.907
- <i>What did Mitchell tell you?</i>
- <i>No, nothing. He...</i>

01:53:40.991 --> 01:53:43.910
<i>Don liked to talk.
I know that.</i>

01:53:43.994 --> 01:53:46.705
<i>Especially to pretty girls like you.</i>

01:53:47.247 --> 01:53:49.249
<i>That's why I made him
take your passport...</i>

01:53:49.958 --> 01:53:52.836
<i>until we could have
this little conversation.</i>

01:53:52.919 --> 01:53:55.630
<i>All I want to do
is get out of here, okay?</i>

01:53:55.714 --> 01:53:57.841
<i>You'll never hear from me again,
nobody will. Please, please...</i>

01:53:57.924 --> 01:54:01.052
<i>We're gonna get you
out of here, I promise.</i>

01:54:01.887 --> 01:54:04.431
<i>But first, I gotta know...</i>

01:54:05.515 --> 01:54:06.850
<i>What did he tell you?</i>

01:54:07.642 --> 01:54:11.188
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

01:54:11.688 --> 01:54:12.898
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

01:54:12.981 --> 01:54:14.941
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

01:54:15.025 --> 01:54:16.318
<i>The deal.</i>

01:54:16.401 --> 01:54:21.323
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

01:54:21.406 --> 01:54:24.117
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

01:54:24.201 --> 01:54:26.578
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

01:54:26.661 --> 01:54:27.788
<i>Right.</i>

01:54:28.538 --> 01:54:29.915
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:54:30.874 --> 01:54:33.043
<i>Hmm. Okay.</i>

01:54:40.717 --> 01:54:42.052
<i>Just take it easy.</i>

01:54:42.135 --> 01:54:43.678
Jesus, he's strangling her.

01:54:43.762 --> 01:54:46.807
<i>Take it easy.</i>

01:54:56.024 --> 01:54:57.317
<i>Rata Alada.</i>

01:55:02.072 --> 01:55:03.865
A falcon has wings too.

01:55:04.199 --> 01:55:06.034
Falcone is the rat?

01:55:17.003 --> 01:55:20.173
Falcone works for you guys?

01:55:20.841 --> 01:55:23.385
The mayor? The DA?

01:55:26.388 --> 01:55:27.472
No.

01:55:30.559 --> 01:55:31.852
We work for him.

01:55:32.853 --> 01:55:34.104
Everybody does.

01:55:34.187 --> 01:55:35.188
How?

01:55:35.272 --> 01:55:36.857
Through Renewal.

01:55:37.649 --> 01:55:39.025
Renewal is everything.

01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:40.444
- The Renewal Fund?
- Yeah.

01:55:41.027 --> 01:55:44.740
After Thomas Wayne died,
they all went after it like vultures.

01:55:44.823 --> 01:55:48.410
The mayor, Falcone, Maroni.
Everyone got in on it.

01:55:48.493 --> 01:55:51.872
It was perfect for making bribes,
laundering money.

01:55:51.955 --> 01:55:54.040
A huge charitable fund
with no oversight.

01:55:54.124 --> 01:55:55.834
Everybody got a piece.

01:55:55.917 --> 01:55:57.753
But Falcone wanted more.

01:55:59.546 --> 01:56:02.758
So he orchestrated a play
to take Maroni down big.

01:56:04.176 --> 01:56:06.511
He'd rat out his drops operation,

01:56:06.887 --> 01:56:09.598
make the careers of everybody
that went after him,

01:56:09.681 --> 01:56:12.142
then install them all as his puppets.

01:56:12.225 --> 01:56:14.770
You think this goddamn election matters?

01:56:16.396 --> 01:56:18.315
Falcone's the mayor.

01:56:19.274 --> 01:56:21.777
He's been the mayor
for the last 20 years.

01:56:21.860 --> 01:56:23.236
Come on, Vengeance.

01:56:23.945 --> 01:56:25.781
Let's go kill that son of a bitch.

01:56:26.490 --> 01:56:28.116
- This creep too. Let's finish this.
- Oh, God!

01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:29.034
No!

01:56:30.494 --> 01:56:31.703
We'll get him.

01:56:32.370 --> 01:56:34.247
- But not that way.
- There is no other way!

01:56:34.331 --> 01:56:35.457
He owns the city!

01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.792
Cross that line...

01:56:37.584 --> 01:56:38.877
you'll become just like him.

01:56:39.586 --> 01:56:41.129
Listen to me.

01:56:41.213 --> 01:56:43.090
Don't throw your life away.

01:56:49.638 --> 01:56:51.014
Don't worry, honey.

01:56:54.101 --> 01:56:55.560
I got nine of 'em.

01:56:55.685 --> 01:56:57.646
No, don't! Hey, hey!

01:56:58.939 --> 01:57:00.232
Oh, God!

01:57:09.533 --> 01:57:10.659
She won't get out of there alive.

01:57:10.826 --> 01:57:13.412
And if she kills Falcone,
we may never find the Riddler.

01:57:13.495 --> 01:57:14.496
I have to stop her.

01:57:14.663 --> 01:57:15.622
Don't you mean "we"?

01:57:16.957 --> 01:57:18.500
I gotta do this my way.

01:57:18.834 --> 01:57:19.835
And then what?

01:57:20.710 --> 01:57:22.087
We do what Riddler said.

01:57:22.921 --> 01:57:24.548
Bring the rat into the light.

01:58:00.500 --> 01:58:02.544
Can you tell Mr. Falcone
I'd like to come up?

01:58:02.627 --> 01:58:04.087
He ain't seein' nobody tonight.

01:58:04.713 --> 01:58:06.047
Tell him it's about Annika.

01:58:09.301 --> 01:58:10.635
Hey!

01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:12.888
Look who it is, huh?

01:58:12.971 --> 01:58:15.390
- Sorry to bother you.
- Nah. It's fine, beautiful.

01:58:15.474 --> 01:58:17.476
I was just hoping
I could talk to you for a minute?

01:58:17.642 --> 01:58:19.102
Absolutely.

01:58:20.854 --> 01:58:21.855
Alone?

01:58:38.413 --> 01:58:39.498
Hey!

01:58:50.050 --> 01:58:51.259
I'm just so worried.

01:58:51.343 --> 01:58:52.969
I don't know where she is.

01:58:54.721 --> 01:58:58.100
And I know
that you're a very important man.

01:58:58.183 --> 01:59:01.603
I was hoping that maybe
you could help me find her...

01:59:03.105 --> 01:59:05.482
because she's been gone so long,
I'm beginning to...

01:59:06.942 --> 01:59:08.068
I'm sorry.

01:59:08.276 --> 01:59:09.361
It's okay.

01:59:09.444 --> 01:59:11.571
- I'm so sorry.
- I understand. Here.

01:59:11.738 --> 01:59:14.616
No, that's okay, I have a tissue.

01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:19.788
Mr. Falcone?

01:59:19.871 --> 01:59:21.331
Vinnie! Didn't I tell you?

01:59:21.415 --> 01:59:24.334
I'm sorry, Mr. Falcone. I really think
you're gonna want to see this.

01:59:26.711 --> 01:59:28.213
I'm sorry, beautiful.

01:59:28.296 --> 01:59:29.714
I'll be right back.

01:59:45.021 --> 01:59:46.106
Holy shit.

01:59:46.189 --> 01:59:47.858
<i>That recording, provided to GC-1</i>

01:59:47.941 --> 01:59:50.652

01:59:50.736 --> 01:59:53.572

01:59:56.491 --> 01:59:59.995
<i>He just said
they all made a deal with you.</i>

02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:01.663
<i>Oh. Hmm.</i>

02:00:01.830 --> 02:00:03.498
<i>He told you about that, huh?</i>

02:00:03.582 --> 02:00:05.083
<i>The deal.</i>

02:00:05.167 --> 02:00:09.963
<i>He said you gave some
information on some drops thing</i>

02:00:10.046 --> 02:00:12.966
<i>and that's how he became mayor.</i>

02:00:13.049 --> 02:00:15.594
<i>He said you were a very important man.</i>

02:00:15.677 --> 02:00:16.678
<i>Right.</i>

<i>Hmm.</i>

Hey, Dad.

02:00:33.904 --> 02:00:34.905
What?

02:00:35.363 --> 02:00:37.407
I'm Maria Kyle's kid.

02:00:39.034 --> 02:00:40.494
You remember her?

02:00:42.537 --> 02:00:43.580
Yeah.

02:00:47.876 --> 02:00:48.960
Just put down the gun, honey.

02:00:49.044 --> 02:00:50.128
This is for my mother.

02:01:47.394 --> 02:01:48.562
I see him!

02:02:32.606 --> 02:02:34.357
You don't think this hurts me?

02:02:38.945 --> 02:02:41.239
My own flesh and blood, huh?

02:02:57.631 --> 02:02:59.466
You made me do this.

02:03:00.884 --> 02:03:02.677
Just like your mother.

02:03:08.683 --> 02:03:10.018
He has to pay!

02:03:13.939 --> 02:03:15.065
You don't have to pay with him.

02:03:18.693 --> 02:03:20.195
You paid enough.

02:03:54.771 --> 02:03:55.897
Jesus.

02:03:55.981 --> 02:03:58.692
Look at you, man.
What do you think this is?

02:03:58.775 --> 02:04:01.862
You think you're gonna scare me
with that mask and that cape?

02:04:01.945 --> 02:04:03.196
I'm gonna start crying,

02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:05.782
and all of a sudden,
some big secret's comin' out?

02:04:05.866 --> 02:04:07.492
Let me tell you something.

02:04:07.576 --> 02:04:09.286
Whatever I know,

02:04:09.369 --> 02:04:11.246
whatever I've done,

02:04:11.329 --> 02:04:15.667
it's all going with me to my grave.

02:04:26.219 --> 02:04:28.180
What, are you with Zorro over here?

02:04:29.806 --> 02:04:32.100
Don't you know you boys in blue
work for me?

02:04:40.025 --> 02:04:42.360
I guess we don't all work for you.

02:04:51.369 --> 02:04:52.913
You have the right to remain silent.

02:04:53.747 --> 02:04:57.250
Anything you say can and will
be used against you in a court of law.

02:04:57.334 --> 02:04:58.668
You have the right to an attorney.

02:04:58.752 --> 02:04:59.920
If you cannot afford one,

02:05:00.003 --> 02:05:01.797
the City of Gotham
will provide one to you.

02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:03.590
Do you understand these rights?

02:05:05.092 --> 02:05:06.676
Do you understand?

02:05:08.637 --> 02:05:09.721
Yeah.

02:05:09.805 --> 02:05:11.890
I'll see you when I walk out.

02:05:11.973 --> 02:05:12.974
With these rights in mind,

02:05:13.058 --> 02:05:14.351
is there anything else
you wish to tell...

02:05:14.434 --> 02:05:15.685
Goddamn rat.

02:05:17.646 --> 02:05:18.980
What'd you say?

02:05:19.064 --> 02:05:20.816
Enjoy your night at Blackgate, Carmine.

02:05:21.942 --> 02:05:23.193
Probably be your last.

02:05:23.443 --> 02:05:26.488
Oh-ho. So you're a big man now, Oz?

02:05:26.571 --> 02:05:27.656
Maybe I am.

02:05:27.739 --> 02:05:28.949
Really, Oz?

02:05:29.032 --> 02:05:33.745
Because to me, you were always
just a gimp in an empty suit.

02:05:33.829 --> 02:05:34.913
I'll spray paint your ass!

02:05:39.000 --> 02:05:40.085
What are you doing? It wasn't me!

02:05:40.544 --> 02:05:42.546
I didn't shoot! I didn't shoot!

02:05:43.880 --> 02:05:45.340
Get your hands off of me!

02:06:04.901 --> 02:06:06.903
"Bring him into the light.

02:06:10.490 --> 02:06:12.451
And you'll find where I'm at."

02:06:12.534 --> 02:06:13.618
There!

02:06:13.702 --> 02:06:15.537
The shots came from up there!

02:06:17.122 --> 02:06:18.123
It's Riddler.

02:06:20.208 --> 02:06:21.376
Gage, on me.

02:06:21.460 --> 02:06:24.171
Martinez, around back.
Nobody gets in there, nobody gets out!

02:07:38.370 --> 02:07:39.579
He's gone.

02:07:49.381 --> 02:07:51.341
He's been here this whole time.

02:07:51.425 --> 02:07:53.760
- Lieutenant. Martinez.
- Yeah?

02:07:53.844 --> 02:07:54.970
<i>Lieutenant, we got a witness here,</i>

02:07:55.053 --> 02:07:57.722
<i>says she saw someone coming down
the fire escape right after the shot.</i>

02:07:57.806 --> 02:08:00.267
<i>She said he went into the corner diner.</i>

02:08:00.350 --> 02:08:03.270
<i>The guy's sitting by himself
at the counter, right now.</i>

02:08:18.785 --> 02:08:20.871
Police! Hands up!

02:08:23.915 --> 02:08:27.419
He said put your goddamn
hands up, you son of a bitch.

02:08:46.563 --> 02:08:48.482
I just ordered a slice of pumpkin pie.

02:08:51.443 --> 02:08:52.736
Stay still!

02:08:52.819 --> 02:08:53.820
Now!

02:09:22.474 --> 02:09:24.267
Which one is you?

02:09:24.351 --> 02:09:25.852
You tell me.

02:09:26.686 --> 02:09:28.146
Let's go, pencil-neck.

02:09:31.233 --> 02:09:32.984
Get that son of a bitch out of here!

02:09:47.499 --> 02:09:50.419
<i>...where even murdered
mayor Don Mitchell, Jr.'s wife and son</i>

02:09:50.502 --> 02:09:53.088

<i>Our Dan O'Neil is live

02:09:55.841 --> 02:09:56.883
Hey.

02:10:21.324 --> 02:10:23.034
What are all these diaries?

02:10:23.118 --> 02:10:25.537
They're ledgers. He's got thousands.

02:10:25.620 --> 02:10:29.166
He scrawled all over 'em.
Rambling, ciphers, codes.

02:10:29.249 --> 02:10:30.792
Got something back on one of the IDs.

02:10:30.876 --> 02:10:33.170
Edward Nashton. Works at KTMJ.

02:10:33.253 --> 02:10:35.088
- He's a forensic accountant.
- Accountant?

02:10:35.172 --> 02:10:37.591
Hey, Lieutenant!
You really okay with this?

02:10:37.674 --> 02:10:39.426
What about chain of evidence?

02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:41.470
You should see this.

02:10:47.434 --> 02:10:48.935
He's wearing gloves.

02:10:50.395 --> 02:10:52.647
"Friday, July 16th.

02:10:52.731 --> 02:10:56.443
My life has been a cruel riddle
I could not solve,

02:10:56.777 --> 02:10:59.821
suffocating my mind, no escape.

02:10:59.905 --> 02:11:01.323
But then, today, I saw it.

02:11:01.406 --> 02:11:05.535
A single word on this ledger,
sitting on the desk beside me.

02:11:06.870 --> 02:11:08.663
'Renewal.'

02:11:08.747 --> 02:11:13.168
The empty promise they sold to me
as a child in that orphanage.

02:11:13.251 --> 02:11:16.379
One look inside,
and finally I understood.

02:11:16.463 --> 02:11:19.800
My whole life
has been preparing me for this.

02:11:19.883 --> 02:11:22.344
The moment when I would learn the truth.

02:11:22.427 --> 02:11:25.430
When I could finally strike back
and expose their lies."

02:11:26.556 --> 02:11:28.391
"If you want people to understand,

02:11:28.475 --> 02:11:30.310
really understand,

02:11:30.393 --> 02:11:32.687
you can't just give them the answers.

02:11:32.771 --> 02:11:34.231
You have to confront them,

02:11:34.314 --> 02:11:36.733
torture them
with the horrifying questions,

02:11:36.817 --> 02:11:38.985
just like they tortured me.

02:11:39.069 --> 02:11:41.863
I know now what I must become."

02:11:44.825 --> 02:11:46.159
Jesus.

02:11:52.249 --> 02:11:54.209
I don't think that rat likes you, man.

02:11:54.751 --> 02:11:56.253
This one's not a rat.

02:12:12.894 --> 02:12:14.020
What is that?

02:12:45.635 --> 02:12:46.845
Some kind of pry tool?

02:12:46.928 --> 02:12:48.305
Is it a chisel?

02:12:48.388 --> 02:12:49.848
It's a murder weapon.

02:12:49.931 --> 02:12:51.308
He killed Mitchell with it.

02:12:51.975 --> 02:12:54.853
The edge will match the floorboard
impression in the mayor's study.

02:13:03.445 --> 02:13:05.447
"My confession"?

02:13:05.530 --> 02:13:08.408
What's he confessing to?
He already told us he killed Mitchell.

02:13:08.492 --> 02:13:09.868
This isn't over.

02:13:09.951 --> 02:13:12.370
Oh, man. He's been posting
all kinds of shit online.

02:13:12.788 --> 02:13:14.998
He's got, like, 500 followers.
Real fringe types.

02:13:23.090 --> 02:13:25.300
His final post was last night.

02:13:25.383 --> 02:13:28.595
Some video. Got a lot of views,
but it's password-protected.

02:13:28.678 --> 02:13:31.681
- Can you get in?
- Copying his drive now.

02:13:31.807 --> 02:13:35.227
Take some time, but we'll get in.

02:13:46.571 --> 02:13:49.116
- Show me the post.
- It's right here.

"The Truth Unmasked."

02:13:53.286 --> 02:13:54.913
I think I'm his last target.

02:13:57.499 --> 02:13:58.583
You?

02:13:58.959 --> 02:14:01.002
Maybe this is all coming to an end.

02:14:01.545 --> 02:14:02.921
What is?

02:14:03.380 --> 02:14:04.798
The Batman.

02:14:10.178 --> 02:14:11.346
Yeah?

02:14:22.649 --> 02:14:23.859
Right.

02:14:26.737 --> 02:14:30.699
Riddler's asking for you. At Arkham.

02:14:38.165 --> 02:14:39.666
You're a good cop.

<i>What do you want from me?</i>

02:15:09.321 --> 02:15:10.864
"Want"?

02:15:11.448 --> 02:15:15.077
<i>If only you knew how long
I've been waiting for this day.</i>

02:15:16.286 --> 02:15:17.621
<i>For this moment.</i>

02:15:18.663 --> 02:15:21.666
I've been invisible my whole life.

02:15:22.751 --> 02:15:25.378
I guess I won't be anymore, will I?

02:15:26.922 --> 02:15:29.341
<i>They'll remember me now.</i>

02:15:29.424 --> 02:15:31.259
<i>They'll remember both of us.</i>

<i>Bruce...</i>

02:15:46.483 --> 02:15:48.318
<i>Wayne.</i>

<i>Wayne.</i>

02:16:10.006 --> 02:16:12.426
<i>You know, I was there that day.</i>

<i>The day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for mayor,</i>

02:16:18.473 --> 02:16:20.851
<i>made all those promises.</i>

02:16:23.311 --> 02:16:27.566
<i>Well, a week later he was dead,
and everybody just forgot about us.</i>

02:16:28.108 --> 02:16:31.653
<i>All they could talk about
was poor Bruce Wayne.</i>

02:16:31.737 --> 02:16:35.407
<i>Bruce Wayne, the orphan.</i>

02:16:35.991 --> 02:16:37.534
<i>Orphan.</i>

02:16:43.206 --> 02:16:48.336
<i>Living in some tower over the park
isn't being an orphan.</i>

02:16:49.629 --> 02:16:54.259
<i>Looking down on everyone,
with all that money.</i>

02:16:54.926 --> 02:16:56.470
<i>Don't you tell me.</i>

02:16:59.097 --> 02:17:01.767
Do you know what being an orphan is?

02:17:02.142 --> 02:17:04.728
<i>It's 30 kids to a room.</i>

02:17:06.021 --> 02:17:10.067
<i>Twelve years old and already a drophead,
numbing the pain.</i>

02:17:11.777 --> 02:17:16.448
<i>You wake up screaming
with rats chewing your fingers.</i>

02:17:17.616 --> 02:17:20.786
<i>And every winter one of the babies die</i>

02:17:20.869 --> 02:17:23.163
<i>because it's so cold.</i>

02:17:24.456 --> 02:17:27.042
<i>But, oh, no.</i>

02:17:29.961 --> 02:17:33.131
<i>Let's talk about the billionaire
with the lying, dead daddy</i>

02:17:33.215 --> 02:17:36.134
<i>because at least the money
makes it go down easy.</i>

02:17:36.218 --> 02:17:37.219
<i>Doesn't it?</i>

02:17:38.678 --> 02:17:40.722
<i>Bruce...</i>

02:17:41.765 --> 02:17:43.683
<i>Wayne.</i>

<i>He's the only one we didn't get.</i>

<i>But we got the rest of 'em, didn't we?</i>

02:17:58.448 --> 02:18:02.327
<i>All those slick, sleazy, phony pricks.</i>

02:18:05.497 --> 02:18:06.665
<i>God.</i>

02:18:07.666 --> 02:18:08.959
<i>Look at you.</i>

02:18:10.627 --> 02:18:13.088
Your mask is amazing.

02:18:13.171 --> 02:18:16.091
I wish you could've seen me in mine.

02:18:16.174 --> 02:18:17.259
Ain't it funny?

02:18:17.342 --> 02:18:21.763
<i>All everyone wants to do is unmask you,
but they're missing the point.</i>

02:18:23.223 --> 02:18:25.267
<i>You and I both know</i>

02:18:26.226 --> 02:18:28.728
I'm looking at the real you right now.

02:18:28.812 --> 02:18:32.441
My mask allowed me
to be myself completely.

02:18:32.524 --> 02:18:34.067
<i>No shame,</i>

02:18:34.985 --> 02:18:35.986
<i>no limits.</i>

02:18:36.069 --> 02:18:37.738
<i>Why did you write me?</i>

02:18:38.613 --> 02:18:39.614
<i>What do you mean?</i>

02:18:39.698 --> 02:18:41.408
<i>All those cards.</i>

02:18:41.491 --> 02:18:42.701
<i>I told you,</i>

02:18:43.410 --> 02:18:45.328
<i>we've been doing this together.
You're a part of this.</i>

02:18:45.412 --> 02:18:47.622
- <i>We didn't do anything together.</i>
- We did.

02:18:47.706 --> 02:18:49.166
<i>What did we just do?</i>

02:18:49.249 --> 02:18:51.251
<i>I asked you to bring him into the light,
and you did.</i>

02:18:51.334 --> 02:18:52.502
<i>We're such a good team.</i>

02:18:52.586 --> 02:18:53.587
<i>We're not a team.</i>

02:18:53.670 --> 02:18:56.173
I never could have
gotten him out of there.

02:18:56.256 --> 02:18:58.675
<i>I'm not physical.
My strength is up here.</i>

02:18:58.759 --> 02:19:01.928
<i>I mean, I had all the pieces,
I had the answers.</i>

02:19:02.012 --> 02:19:03.638
But I didn't know
how to make them listen.

02:19:03.722 --> 02:19:04.931
You gave me that.

02:19:05.015 --> 02:19:06.141
<i>I gave you nothing.</i>

02:19:06.224 --> 02:19:08.810
You showed me what was possible.

02:19:08.894 --> 02:19:13.774
<i>You showed me all it takes is fear
and a little focused violence.</i>

02:19:13.857 --> 02:19:15.400
<i>You inspired me.</i>

02:19:15.484 --> 02:19:16.985
<i>You're out of your goddamn mind.</i>

02:19:18.111 --> 02:19:19.196
<i>What?</i>

02:19:19.279 --> 02:19:21.448
<i>This is all in your head.
You're sick, twisted.</i>

02:19:21.531 --> 02:19:22.908
<i>How can you say that?</i>

02:19:22.991 --> 02:19:24.493
You think you'll be remembered?

02:19:24.576 --> 02:19:26.244
<i>You're a pathetic psychopath,</i>

02:19:26.745 --> 02:19:28.497
- begging for attention.
- <i>No.</i>

02:19:28.580 --> 02:19:30.248
- <i>You're gonna die alone in Arkham.</i>
- No.

02:19:30.332 --> 02:19:31.374
<i>No, no!</i>

02:19:31.458 --> 02:19:32.375
<i>A nobody!</i>

02:19:34.169 --> 02:19:35.962
<i>No!</i>

02:19:37.881 --> 02:19:40.258
<i>Ahhh!</i>

02:19:40.509 --> 02:19:43.095
<i>This is not how this was supposed to go!</i>

02:19:44.054 --> 02:19:47.682
<i>Ahhh!</i>

02:19:47.766 --> 02:19:50.393
<i>I had it all planned out!</i>

02:19:51.394 --> 02:19:53.396
<i>We were gonna be safe here.</i>

02:19:53.772 --> 02:19:57.067
We could watch the whole thing together.

02:19:57.150 --> 02:19:58.151
<i>Watch what?</i>

02:19:58.235 --> 02:19:59.986
<i>Everything!</i>

02:20:08.328 --> 02:20:09.996
<i>It was all there.</i>

02:20:12.165 --> 02:20:14.501
<i>You mean, you didn't figure it out?</i>

02:20:18.797 --> 02:20:22.717
<i>Oh, you're really not as smart
as I thought you were.</i>

02:20:24.761 --> 02:20:26.847
<i>I guess I gave you too much credit.</i>

02:20:27.305 --> 02:20:28.557
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:29.266 --> 02:20:34.146
<i>What's black and blue and dead all over?</i>

02:20:36.982 --> 02:20:38.817
<i>You.</i>

02:20:40.485 --> 02:20:42.612
<i>If you think you can stop
what's coming...</i>

02:20:43.947 --> 02:20:45.490
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:47.033 --> 02:20:52.873
<i>Ave Maria</i>

02:20:53.290 --> 02:20:55.167
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:20:57.627 --> 02:20:59.004
<i>Gratia plena</i>

02:20:59.171 --> 02:21:00.589
<i>What have you done?</i>

02:21:04.593 --> 02:21:07.971
<i>Maria</i>

02:21:08.138 --> 02:21:13.685
<i>Gratia plena</i>

02:21:45.550 --> 02:21:46.927

What are you doing in here?

02:22:07.155 --> 02:22:09.741
Hey, man, I don't think that
you should be touching that.

02:22:16.331 --> 02:22:18.792
Boy, this guy's a real nutjob, huh?

02:22:19.668 --> 02:22:22.421
Killing Mitchell
with a friggin' carpet tool.

02:22:27.092 --> 02:22:30.137
My uncle's a... He's an installer.

02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:32.389
You know, it's a... Oh, you know.

02:22:32.472 --> 02:22:34.724
It's a tucker.

02:22:52.534 --> 02:22:53.535
Huh.

02:23:08.717 --> 02:23:11.511
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you doing?

02:23:11.595 --> 02:23:13.096
What are you doing?

02:23:43.627 --> 02:23:45.045
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

02:23:45.378 --> 02:23:47.589
<i>Uh, thanks for all the comments</i>

02:23:47.672 --> 02:23:50.634
<i>and a special thanks to everyone

02:23:50.717 --> 02:23:51.718
Detonators?

02:23:51.802 --> 02:23:56.848
<i>I just want to say this will be my last

02:24:12.155 --> 02:24:13.240
Jesus.

<i>She promised real change.</i>

<i>But we know the truth, don't we?</i>

02:24:31.383 --> 02:24:33.468
<i>You've seen Gotham's true face now.</i>

02:24:33.552 --> 02:24:35.429
<i>Together, we've unmasked it.</i>

02:24:35.512 --> 02:24:38.473
<i>Its corruption, its perversion</i>

02:24:38.557 --> 02:24:42.394

02:24:42.477 --> 02:24:46.314

02:24:48.525 --> 02:24:52.529
<i>The day of judgment is finally upon us.</i>

02:24:52.612 --> 02:24:54.990
<i>And now it is time</i>

02:24:58.535 --> 02:25:01.329

02:25:05.167 --> 02:25:07.043
<i>And on the big night,</i>

Boom!

Boom!

<i>When the vans blow,</i>

02:25:36.615 --> 02:25:42.245

<i>Those who are not washed away</i>

Call Gordon.

02:25:49.878 --> 02:25:52.005
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

<i>...celebrations will turn to panic,</i>

02:26:00.388 --> 02:26:05.227

02:26:06.603 --> 02:26:10.607
<i>And that's where all of you come in.</i>

02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:20.325
<i>Now, when the time arrives,
I will already be unmasked.</i>

02:26:20.409 --> 02:26:22.577

<i>We'll give them real, real change now.</i>

02:26:56.903 --> 02:27:01.908
<i>We've spent our lives in this
wretched place, suffering!</i>

02:27:02.367 --> 02:27:04.870
<i>Wondering, "Why us?"</i>

02:27:04.953 --> 02:27:08.081
<i>Now they will spend
their last moments wondering,</i>

02:27:08.165 --> 02:27:10.333
<i>why them?</i>

02:27:10.417 --> 02:27:12.461
I can't get through! The lines are down.

02:27:18.091 --> 02:27:20.260
Hey, hey, hey! Road's closed!

02:27:20.844 --> 02:27:22.471
I'm just trying to get out of town, man!

02:27:22.554 --> 02:27:25.432
Lady, we got bombs going off.
The whole city's flooding.

02:27:25.515 --> 02:27:27.476
You're gonna have to go inside
the Garden with everyone else.

02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:38.779
- Lieutenant, who's in charge?
- I really don't know.

02:27:38.862 --> 02:27:40.363
We're just trying
to get a handle here, sir.

02:27:40.447 --> 02:27:42.282
Right. Hey, listen! Quiet!

02:27:42.365 --> 02:27:43.617
We got an active situation.

02:27:43.742 --> 02:27:45.035
We need to sweep the building
for explosives

02:27:45.118 --> 02:27:46.328
and get the mayor-elect
out of here, now.

02:27:46.411 --> 02:27:47.329
- Where is she?
- I can take you there.

02:27:47.412 --> 02:27:48.246
Come!

02:28:24.282 --> 02:28:25.700
- If we don't close the doors...
- MCU.

02:28:25.784 --> 02:28:26.660
...we're gonna have huge problems.

02:28:26.743 --> 02:28:28.120
The water's already started to breach.

02:28:28.203 --> 02:28:29.746
I thought this was
a shelter of last resort.

02:28:29.830 --> 02:28:32.040
Yeah, for a hurricane,
but not if the whole seawall comes down.

02:28:32.124 --> 02:28:33.959
I am not gonna let
those people die out there.

02:28:34.042 --> 02:28:36.378
All right. I'll go calm down the crowd
so we can get everyone in.

02:28:36.461 --> 02:28:38.713
It's not safe for you here.
We need to get you out, Ms. Reál.

02:28:38.797 --> 02:28:41.049
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We're under attack, ma'am.

02:28:41.133 --> 02:28:42.968
Exactly! That's the problem
with this city.

02:28:43.051 --> 02:28:46.054
Everyone's afraid to stand up
and do the right thing, but I'm not.

02:28:46.138 --> 02:28:47.639
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am...

02:28:52.811 --> 02:28:56.273
Everyone, everyone,
if I could just get your attention.

02:28:56.356 --> 02:28:58.650
Please! I just need your attention!

02:29:14.541 --> 02:29:15.667
You're okay!

02:30:46.591 --> 02:30:49.219
Hey! Hey! How do I get up there?

02:30:49.302 --> 02:30:50.512
Follow me, sir.

02:33:00.517 --> 02:33:02.018
No, no. It's okay.

02:33:02.102 --> 02:33:03.145
It's okay.

02:33:04.312 --> 02:33:05.355
It's okay.

02:33:06.982 --> 02:33:09.109
It's done now. It's done.

02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:13.155
It's over.

02:34:09.002 --> 02:34:12.464
Hey! Hey, man, take it easy!

02:34:13.173 --> 02:34:15.509
Take it easy. Easy.

02:34:44.079 --> 02:34:45.205
Jesus.

02:34:55.048 --> 02:34:56.716
Who the hell are you?

02:35:00.929 --> 02:35:01.930
Me?

02:35:05.100 --> 02:35:06.518
I'm Vengeance.

<i>Wednesday, November 6th.</i>

02:38:44.486 --> 02:38:46.363
<i>The city is underwater.</i>

<i>The National Guard is coming.</i>

<i>Martial law is in effect...</i>

<i>but the criminal element never sleeps.</i>

02:39:00.502 --> 02:39:04.214
<i>Looting and lawlessness will be rampant</i>

02:39:08.009 --> 02:39:11.721
<i>I can already see things will get worse
before they get better.</i>

02:39:14.683 --> 02:39:17.811
<i>And some will seize the chance
to grab everything they can.</i>

02:39:19.187 --> 02:39:20.564
<i>We will rebuild.</i>

02:39:21.189 --> 02:39:22.649
But not just our city.

02:39:23.358 --> 02:39:27.571
We must rebuild people's faith
in our institutions,

02:39:27.654 --> 02:39:29.740
in our elected officials,

02:39:29.823 --> 02:39:31.116
in each other.

02:39:31.908 --> 02:39:35.245
Together, we will learn
to believe in Gotham again.

02:39:39.583 --> 02:39:41.251
<i>I'm starting to see now.</i>

02:39:42.711 --> 02:39:44.880
<i>I have had an effect here...</i>

02:39:46.965 --> 02:39:48.884

<i>I have to become more.</i>

02:40:05.567 --> 02:40:07.194
<i>People need hope.</i>

02:40:08.403 --> 02:40:10.614
<i>To know someone's out there for them.</i>

02:40:14.409 --> 02:40:16.078
<i>The city's angry,</i>

02:40:16.995 --> 02:40:18.371
<i>scarred,</i>

<i>like me.</i>

02:40:22.667 --> 02:40:24.753
<i>Our scars can destroy us.</i>

02:40:26.129 --> 02:40:28.840
<i>Even after
the physical wounds have healed.</i>

02:40:30.467 --> 02:40:32.219
<i>But if we survive them,</i>

02:40:33.720 --> 02:40:35.597
<i>they can transform us.</i>

02:40:37.474 --> 02:40:39.392
<i>They can give us the power</i>

02:40:40.352 --> 02:40:41.853
<i>to endure...</i>

02:40:43.230 --> 02:40:45.357
<i>and the strength to fight.</i>

02:40:48.276 --> 02:40:50.445
<i>We are live. As you can see,</i>

02:40:50.529 --> 02:40:53.323
<i>the masked vigilante
atop Gotham Square Garden</i>

02:40:53.407 --> 02:40:54.991
<i>helping to save the lives</i>

02:40:55.075 --> 02:40:56.701
<i>of hundreds of victims.</i>

02:40:56.785 --> 02:40:59.788
<i>And now as first responders desperately
scramble to help the injured,</i>

02:40:59.871 --> 02:41:02.416
<i>a mysterious masked man emerges,</i>

02:41:02.499 --> 02:41:04.835
<i>heroically pulling the victims
right through that skylight...</i>

02:41:04.918 --> 02:41:07.379
Isn't that just terrible?

02:41:08.755 --> 02:41:10.674
Him...

02:41:10.757 --> 02:41:13.635
raining on your parade like that?

02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:21.351
What is it they say?

02:41:22.519 --> 02:41:24.688
"One day you're on top,

02:41:26.231 --> 02:41:27.899
the next...

02:41:29.276 --> 02:41:31.194
you're a clown."

02:41:33.572 --> 02:41:34.740
Well,

02:41:36.533 --> 02:41:39.369
let me tell you,
there are worse things to be.

02:41:41.663 --> 02:41:44.332
Hey, hey, hey. Don't be sad.

02:41:45.625 --> 02:41:47.461
You did so well.

02:41:51.965 --> 02:41:52.966
And you know,

02:41:54.634 --> 02:41:57.846
Gotham loves a comeback story.

02:42:07.898 --> 02:42:09.274
Who are you?

02:42:09.816 --> 02:42:12.235
Well, that's the question,

02:42:13.487 --> 02:42:14.654
isn't it?

02:42:17.574 --> 02:42:19.951
Riddle me this...

02:42:22.412 --> 02:42:24.539
"The less of them you have,

02:42:25.290 --> 02:42:29.127
the more one is worth."

02:42:34.549 --> 02:42:36.301
A friend.

02:43:02.536 --> 02:43:03.537
You're leaving.

02:43:04.454 --> 02:43:05.539
Jesus.

02:43:07.290 --> 02:43:08.875
Don't you ever just say hello?

02:43:13.964 --> 02:43:15.382
Where will you go?

02:43:16.883 --> 02:43:19.302
I don't know. Upstate.

02:43:19.719 --> 02:43:21.430
Bludhaven, maybe.

02:43:22.305 --> 02:43:23.306
Why?

02:43:24.516 --> 02:43:25.725
You asking me to stay?

02:43:32.774 --> 02:43:34.901
You know this place
is never gonna change.

02:43:35.318 --> 02:43:37.654
With Carmine gone,
it's only gonna get worse for you.

02:43:37.738 --> 02:43:39.656
There's gonna be a power grab.

02:43:41.283 --> 02:43:42.409
It'll be bloody.

02:43:43.034 --> 02:43:44.244
I know.

02:43:45.787 --> 02:43:46.872
But the city can change.

02:43:46.955 --> 02:43:48.206
It won't.

02:43:49.332 --> 02:43:50.333
I have to try.

02:43:50.417 --> 02:43:52.210
It's gonna kill you eventually.
You know that.

02:43:54.504 --> 02:43:55.630
Listen.

02:43:58.049 --> 02:43:59.301
Why don't you come with me?

02:44:00.260 --> 02:44:01.762
Get into some trouble.

02:44:02.512 --> 02:44:06.016
Knock off some CEO hedge fund types.
It'll be fun.

02:44:06.683 --> 02:44:08.310
The bat and the cat.

02:44:09.811 --> 02:44:11.480
It's got a nice ring.

02:44:24.826 --> 02:44:26.244
Who am I kidding?

02:44:27.704 --> 02:44:29.831
You're already spoken for.

02:44:41.718 --> 02:44:43.136
You should go.

02:44:51.478 --> 02:44:52.479
Selina...

02:44:56.566 --> 02:44:58.235
Take care of yourself.
