[singing in Spanish]

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.462
[chattering]

00:00:47.047 --> 00:00:48.048
[horn honking]

00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:51.134
All right, baby. So, what color
do you want for your beach umbrella?

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.555
I picked indigo.
Shit, I don't even know what indigo is.

00:00:54.638 --> 00:00:57.599
Also, look. Do you want a girl or a guy
for our couples massage?

00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:00.852
Ooh. I don't actually think
I want a couples massage with you.

00:01:00.936 --> 00:01:01.770
Why not?

00:01:01.853 --> 00:01:05.357
Well, baby, because you're always
moaning and groaning and saying stuff
like,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.943
"Ooh, yeah. Right there. Right there.
Ooh, yeah. Don't stop." [sighs]

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:09.152
Yeah. I be into it, man.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.281
When they touching the right spot, can't
help but let 'em know how good it is.

00:01:12.364 --> 00:01:13.865
The masseuse likes that.

00:01:13.949 --> 00:01:15.909
And plus, I have so much tension, baby.

00:01:15.993 --> 00:01:19.037
Maybe you wouldn't have so much
tension if you weren't always on your
phone.

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:21.373
Baby, I'm working on four projects
at the same time.

00:01:21.456 --> 00:01:23.375
We gotta use different builders
all across the city.

00:01:23.458 --> 00:01:24.418
You know--

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:27.087
-But you know what? You're right.
-Hmm.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.257
I'ma put this away, and no more phones
for the rest of this vacation.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.717
-[cell phone rings]
-Oh, hold up.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.804
Hi, Daddy.
No, this is fine. We just landed.

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:38.181
Yeah. Marcus, there he is.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:41.393
[Latin music continues]

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.482
Yeah, Daddy. The flight was fine.
Yeah, I'm here with Marcus.

00:01:48.775 --> 00:01:51.361
Still.
[whispering] We have talked about this.

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:54.740
Daddy, I know. I do love him.

00:01:56.283 --> 00:01:58.076
[phone rings]

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:59.119
Front desk.

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:00.704
Can you connect me with Maurillio?

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.749
Speaking, Mr. Parker.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:04.958
How'd you know it was me?

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:07.085
Uh, let's just say
after eight or nine calls,

00:02:07.169 --> 00:02:10.047
I become very much acquainted
with the timbre of your voice.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.716
I'm just calling you to confirm
you set up everything we discussed.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.885
Yes. Yes, yes.
I have personally seen to it.

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.471
The Dom Pérignon,
the rose petals in the bed,

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:21.350
the Bill Withers playlist
"Greatest Hits: No Deep Cuts."

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:24.311
Sir, if she says no after all this,
I will marry you.

00:02:24.394 --> 00:02:26.938
All right, Maurillio. Not-- Not you too--

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:29.274
[man chanting]

00:02:29.358 --> 00:02:32.235
[whooping]

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.820
[Maurillio] <i>Sir? You trailed off.</i>

00:02:33.904 --> 00:02:35.530
All good. <i>Gracias</i>.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:37.866
Oh, baby, look at those two.

00:02:38.575 --> 00:02:40.285
-What? These lunatics?
-What? No.

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:42.996
They look like they're having fun.
We should try that.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.790
-That looks fun to you?
-Yes.

00:02:44.873 --> 00:02:47.626
That's the reason why you don't see a lot
of Black paraplegics. You know why?

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.169
'Cause we don't do stupid shit like that.

00:02:49.252 --> 00:02:51.755
Look at 'em. They riding around
like they got no insurance.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:54.758
[engine revving]

00:02:54.841 --> 00:02:58.887
[woman] Oh, my God. This is the hotel?

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.933
Maybe it's not too late for us to get
a room at the Best Western by the
airport.

00:03:04.434 --> 00:03:06.603
[both laughing]

00:03:06.687 --> 00:03:10.982
Mr. Parker! And you must be Emily.
I'm Maurillio, the manager.

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.902
Please help yourselves to a papaya paleta

00:03:13.985 --> 00:03:16.697
powdered in our house-roasted
guajillo-cacao rub.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.907
Oh. I don't know what this is, but cheers!

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.951
You must be very eager
to get to your suite

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:24.079
where there may or may not be
a surprise waiting for you.

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:25.997
-A surprise?
-[Maurillio] Hmm.

00:03:26.081 --> 00:03:28.250
I don't know. Let's find out.

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:30.711
-Hmm.
-Okay. [giggles]

00:03:30.794 --> 00:03:33.130
[Maurillio] Now, Emily,
I want you to know something.

00:03:33.213 --> 00:03:36.091
This man right here,
he loves you very, very much.

00:03:36.174 --> 00:03:37.384
Yes, he does.

00:03:37.467 --> 00:03:39.261
[giggles] But how do you know that?

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.513
Let's just say I have a feeling.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.390
[chuckles]

00:03:43.473 --> 00:03:44.474
Ladies first.

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:48.228
So that you may be the first one
to see what awaits, if anything.

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.438
There could be nothing.

00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.857
-What the fuck is your problem?
-What is it?

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.734
-What the fuck? You giving out clues.
-It's fine.

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:54.818
-It's not fine!
-It's fine.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.902
-No, it's not!
-Come on.

00:03:55.986 --> 00:03:57.988
[Latin pop music playing]

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:03.285
-Ah. We have finally arrived.
-Thank you.

00:04:04.411 --> 00:04:05.412
-Ahhh.
-Okay.

00:04:06.788 --> 00:04:09.499
<i>Señora</i>,
may you always remember this moment.

00:04:09.583 --> 00:04:11.251
For the rest of your life.

00:04:11.918 --> 00:04:14.129
-Okay. [giggles]
-Ooh. We could take a picture of this.

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:19.968
["Lovely Day" playing]

00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:22.304
Oh. [whimpers]

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.854
I cannot apologize enough.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.981
It seems the guests
in the Presidential Suite

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:34.941
above your room overfilled the Jacuzzi.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:37.277
So, that means you're gonna put us
in another room, right?

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.487
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.697
If there was room available,
it would be yours.

00:04:40.781 --> 00:04:43.533
Sadly, the hotel is fully booked.

00:04:43.617 --> 00:04:46.453
Why would you say "of course"
if you knew you didn't have another
room?

00:04:46.536 --> 00:04:47.788
You know how misleading that is?

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:50.165
Can you just check
with any of the other hotels nearby?

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:54.503
Of course. We have relationships with all
of the five-star hotels. No problem.

00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:56.004
Just a second.

00:04:56.087 --> 00:04:57.297
Hmm.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.509
Well, let me go ahead and also check
for four-star hotels.

00:05:01.218 --> 00:05:04.179
Ah. You know, a lot of people have issues
with three-star hotels,

00:05:04.262 --> 00:05:07.015
but they are just as good
as five-star hotels.

00:05:07.098 --> 00:05:10.560
Yeah, after three,
it's, like, too much, you know?

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.562
[typing]

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:14.898
And there you have it.

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:19.194
One-star hotel with a great room
at the Airport Best Western.

00:05:19.277 --> 00:05:20.612
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:05:20.695 --> 00:05:23.657
Well, according to this, sir,
it is the best Western in the area.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.493
Let me tell you something, okay?
I had an itinerary planned.

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:29.037
We was gonna go whale watching,
we was gonna go tequila tasting.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.541
-I booked a dinner at sunset on the
beach! -[man] Maurillio!

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:34.125
-Where is that son of a bitch?
-[woman] Yes!

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:37.420
Maurillio! My <i>amigo</i>.

00:05:37.504 --> 00:05:39.631
Thank you so much for
that Jet Ski hookup.

00:05:39.714 --> 00:05:41.550
Man, we felt some killer waves
on the second break.

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.177
-Oh, my gosh. Then we got high as shit.
-We did.

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:46.763
So we literally had to jump off
and go body surfing.

00:05:46.847 --> 00:05:48.849
Yeah, but we turned around
and the Jet Ski was gone.

00:05:48.932 --> 00:05:52.978
But don't freak out because I actually
took a photo of exactly where we left it.

00:05:53.061 --> 00:05:54.563
You are gonna have no problem finding it.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.022
[man] She's the brains.

00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:58.108
Okay, okay. Thank you, <i>señora</i>.

00:05:58.191 --> 00:05:59.192
You're welcome. [giggles]

00:05:59.276 --> 00:06:02.612
Excuse me, lady with the phone
in the goddamn sandwich bag.

00:06:02.696 --> 00:06:04.030
Hi. How are you guys?

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.949
Were you guys having a conversation?

00:06:06.032 --> 00:06:09.953
'Cause you assumed that Maurillio
wasn't already talking to somebody.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.414
You just walk your happy ass in here
and cut me off.

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.749
Now, look. I don't mean to snap.
It's a lot going on right now.

00:06:14.833 --> 00:06:16.209
-I'm a little stressed out.
-It's okay.

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:18.169
I just wanna holler at him real quick.
Can I do that?

00:06:18.253 --> 00:06:19.713
-Yeah. You enjoy your day.
-Thank you.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.214
Enjoy this gorgeous weather.

00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:23.300
[laughs]

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:28.263
Maurillio. You do know how important
this trip is to us, man.

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.473
Yes, of course.
We want your proposal to be perfect.

00:06:31.808 --> 00:06:33.768
-Proposal?
-Oh, shit.

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:36.229
-[Emily] Baby.
-No, no. I will fix this.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:37.772
Emily.

00:06:42.819 --> 00:06:44.779
-I am sorry. I cannot fix it.
-Fuck you, Maurillio!

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:45.906
That's fair.

00:06:47.115 --> 00:06:48.992
Babe, come over here.
Let me talk to you.

00:06:49.075 --> 00:06:52.329
-Okay. Yes. Yes. Yes.
-You guys have a good one. [giggles]

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.956
-Did she text you back?
-Nah, not yet.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.875
I'm sorry this didn't go as I planned it.

00:06:58.877 --> 00:06:59.878
Look, um…

00:07:00.378 --> 00:07:01.546
Oh, my God.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.131
[Marcus] I might as well do it up.

00:07:03.214 --> 00:07:04.424
Okay, I'm just try--

00:07:04.507 --> 00:07:06.801
-My flow is all thrown off.
-It's okay. Just keep going.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:08.261
Just please, just keep going.

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.346
[Marcus] Baby, um…

00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:12.933
-Shut up!
-[Marcus] Look, you mean so much to
me.

00:07:13.016 --> 00:07:15.310
-Baby, I love you so much.
-[breathes shakily]

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:17.854
And I know today has been
all over the place…

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:19.022
[sighs]

00:07:19.105 --> 00:07:20.482
…and I can be a bit of a control freak,

00:07:20.565 --> 00:07:22.525
and when stuff ain't going my way,
I get all uptight,

00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:24.402
-and I overthink things…
-Oh, baby.

00:07:24.486 --> 00:07:26.863
…but the one thing
I could never think twice about…

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.116
is how much I actually love you.

00:07:34.621 --> 00:07:36.873
-Baby, will you marry me?
-[gasps]

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.669
Yes! [chuckles]

00:07:40.752 --> 00:07:42.921
-Oh, yes!
-Oh, my God.

00:07:43.004 --> 00:07:45.715
-Yes! Yeah! Fucking A, Maurillio. Yes!
-Yes!

00:07:45.799 --> 00:07:47.717
-[man] You had me! You were like…
-[woman] That was beautiful!

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.136
"The only thing
I didn't need to think about was you."

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:51.805
You guys! It was you.

00:07:51.888 --> 00:07:54.474
It was-- Baby, I love you!
I love you so much.

00:07:54.557 --> 00:07:57.018
Baby, I love you so much. I love you.

00:07:57.102 --> 00:07:59.437
And you know what,
I don't care that we lost the room.

00:07:59.521 --> 00:08:01.940
I know.
I know how hard you worked. I don't
care.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.901
We can camp out on the beach.
I just wanna be your woman!

00:08:04.985 --> 00:08:07.195
No! No! Nobody's camping on the beach.

00:08:07.278 --> 00:08:09.614
-You get that out of your head right now.
-I love you guys.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:12.367
-Like, you have to stay with us.
-With us.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.078
Consider it, like, our engagement present
to your beautiful souls.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:15.996
Yes.

00:08:16.079 --> 00:08:18.415
-Nah. Yeah. Yeah. We're okay.
-Nah, we good. Yeah. We're fine.

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:20.834
You're gonna say no
to the Presidential Suite?

00:08:20.917 --> 00:08:22.919
It has a Jacuzzi and everything.

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:26.131
[Latin music playing]

00:08:28.508 --> 00:08:32.512
I know we gave that tub a rough ride,
but what happened to craftsmanship,
right?

00:08:32.595 --> 00:08:33.930
-[footsteps approaching]
-Eh.

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.142
Okay. So I had them move your bags
to the master suite.

00:08:37.225 --> 00:08:39.269
Oh, girl. That is way too much.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:40.353
What? No, no, no.

00:08:40.437 --> 00:08:42.605
Get yourselves comfortable.
You are our guests.

00:08:42.689 --> 00:08:44.315
It is truly the least we can do

00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:48.153
after our wonky 'cuzzi fucked up
your totally beautiful proposal.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:49.612
Well, look. Maybe…

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.407
Maybe for tonight, okay?

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:53.867
-Until we get another hotel.
-Yes!

00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.494
-Yes! Oh, boy!
-Settled. Who's thirsty?

00:08:56.578 --> 00:08:57.954
Sit, sit, sit. Get comfortable.

00:08:58.038 --> 00:09:01.791
Oh, if you guys are worried about privacy
and you wanna get really kinky tonight--

00:09:01.875 --> 00:09:02.917
We're extremely loud.

00:09:02.959 --> 00:09:06.838
I don't know what these walls are made
of, but you seriously can't hear anything!

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:08.465
Okay. Listen.

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:09.716
[door closes]

00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:12.552
[woman screams]

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:13.845
[door opens]

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:18.433
You're not gonna believe this.
I just screamed in there.

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:22.979
-Uh…
-Yeah, we, um… we-- we-- we heard you.

00:09:23.063 --> 00:09:24.481
Are you sure it was me?

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.399
-Yeah. Pretty certain.
-[phone rings]

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:29.527
Yo! Oh, no, we're fine.

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:32.197
Nah, it's just my gal screaming.
[sniffs] Yeah, you bet.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:36.367
Hey, guys.
I don't mean to pry or anything,

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:39.829
but are you guys, like,
secret billionaires or something?

00:09:39.913 --> 00:09:42.165
-Why do you ask?
-'Cause this place looks very expensive.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:44.918
Oh, super expensive. We spent, like,
every penny we had on this place.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.002
Yeah.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:47.253
Wait. Why would you do that?

00:09:47.337 --> 00:09:49.923
[man] My buddy Charlie came here
way back when and raved about it.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:52.717
If we're gonna go on vacation,
might as well go all out, right?

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.427
And just go broke?

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.720
Oh, we'll make more money.

00:09:55.804 --> 00:09:58.807
I work in a doctor's office.
Ron here is a park ranger.

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.142
And not to brag, we're pretty good.

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.978
Kyla and I always say
if we find ourselves with too much money,

00:10:04.062 --> 00:10:05.939
we haven't been spending it fast enough.

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:07.482
That-- That's one way to live.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:09.484
You know, they say
money buys you freedom,

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.278
but how can you really be free if you're
thinking about making money all the
time?

00:10:12.362 --> 00:10:15.740
Well, I guess it's your welfare checks
I've been paying. [chuckles]

00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.951
Possibly. Possibly, Marcus.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:21.162
-[chuckling] Anyway, to the happy couple.
-[Kyla] To the happy, gorgeous couple!

00:10:21.246 --> 00:10:22.747
-All right.
-[Kyla] Yeah, you're engaged!

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:23.706
[giggles]

00:10:24.582 --> 00:10:25.583
-[slurping]
-Oh, that is good.

00:10:25.667 --> 00:10:28.336
Ron makes the best margaritas,
and let me just tell you, girl.

00:10:28.419 --> 00:10:29.754
-Babe.
-It gets the job done.

00:10:29.838 --> 00:10:30.755
[Ron] Indeed.

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:32.549
So, Ron. What park do you work at?

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.301
Oh. Oregon National Cave Monument.
It's in Oregon.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.928
Whoa. You work in caves?

00:10:37.011 --> 00:10:40.306
I'm like Batman. If Batman's job was
to keep kids from jacking off stalagmites.

00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.307
[Kyla] Totally.

00:10:41.391 --> 00:10:42.475
What about you guys?

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.352
Uh, we're from Chicago, actually.

00:10:44.435 --> 00:10:47.480
I work in finance and Marcus owns
his own construction company.

00:10:47.564 --> 00:10:51.609
Quick question.
Um, why does the salt not taste salty?

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:53.570
-Oh, because it's cocaine.
-What?

00:10:54.696 --> 00:10:56.614
-You drugged us?
-[Ron, Kyla] Yeah.

00:10:56.698 --> 00:10:59.450
I thought I made it really clear
when I said to her-- I was like, you know,

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:01.411
-"It'll get the job done."
-"It gets the job done."

00:11:01.494 --> 00:11:04.831
Get the job done? That's not clear.
That's very vague, okay?

00:11:04.914 --> 00:11:08.459
What is wrong with you?
Why would you put cocaine in
margaritas?

00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:11.462
Because we're on vacation.

00:11:11.546 --> 00:11:12.714
I don't do drugs.

00:11:14.591 --> 00:11:16.634
-Even on vacation?
-No.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.806
[both laughing]

00:11:21.890 --> 00:11:23.349
-[Ron] He almost had me!
-[Kyla] Oh, my God.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.894
-He almost-- [laughs]
-It's so good!

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:28.897
-You! Oh, man! This is-- This guy!
-Oh, my God. I just--

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:30.523
It would have been nice
if you would've told us

00:11:30.607 --> 00:11:32.358
that you was gonna put cocaine
in our drink.

00:11:32.442 --> 00:11:33.818
Where'd you get the coke from, anyway?

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:36.779
We actually brought it from home.
Very, very easy if you ever wanna try it.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:38.615
It's just a Ziploc
in a full shampoo bottle.

00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.909
The scanners can't see it,
dogs can't smell it,

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:43.494
and it's so much more comfortable
than when I had it in my ass.

00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:44.579
You guys want nibbles?

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:46.039
-Mmm.
-[cell phone vibrates]

00:11:46.122 --> 00:11:47.248
Oh.

00:11:47.332 --> 00:11:48.333
Wait a minute.

00:11:48.416 --> 00:11:49.918
[sighs] What now, baby?

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:53.087
Whale watching. I forgot
I booked a whale watching tour at 4:30.

00:11:53.171 --> 00:11:54.464
What? You guys just got here.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.257
Marcus likes to plan.

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.843
You know what? Good for you.

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:01.638
'Cause without a plan,
the world falls apart.

00:12:01.721 --> 00:12:03.348
I mean, garbage doesn't get collected.

00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:06.142
Water slides don't get built.
Planes fall from the sky.

00:12:06.768 --> 00:12:08.311
Planning makes the world work.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:12.649
Yeah, it's just, uh… just whale watching.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:14.984
Wait. I have an idea.
We were actually gonna go to the water.

00:12:15.068 --> 00:12:17.904
We can walk you guys down, all chat and
get to know each other a little bit more.

00:12:17.987 --> 00:12:20.031
-What do you say?
-All right. Let's go get changed.

00:12:20.114 --> 00:12:21.199
[Kyla] Yay!

00:12:21.282 --> 00:12:23.201
I love your whole everything, by the way.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.662
-[man chanting]
-[baby crying]

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:28.915
They said this was exclusive.

00:12:29.916 --> 00:12:33.044
"An exclusive, luxury experience."
That's what the website said.

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:34.796
This is really gonna bum out the whales.

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:36.381
[Kyla] Baby, this is so gross.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.841
I won't be able to sleep at night
if I know they've gone on this boat.

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.094
You guys,
you should just come with us in our boat.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:43.513
-[Ron] That's a great idea.
-Wait a minute. That boat is yours?

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.432
As long as we're staying here it is.
We rented it. What do you say? Our treat.

00:12:46.516 --> 00:12:49.644
-I mean, I'm down if you're down.
-[Kyla gasps]

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.104
-Yay!
-[chuckling] Oh.

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:52.563
[laughs] Could you give us a second?

00:12:52.647 --> 00:12:54.983
-Gonna talk to my lady really quick.
-No problem. Not a problem.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.192
-Be right back.
-See you in a bit.

00:12:56.276 --> 00:12:57.443
-Baby.
-Yeah, babe?

00:12:58.945 --> 00:13:00.863
How is someone already throwing up?

00:13:00.947 --> 00:13:03.574
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
This is not weird to you?

00:13:03.658 --> 00:13:05.034
-I mean--
-Don't look. They're not weird?

00:13:05.118 --> 00:13:09.330
They're the only people I've ever heard of
to smuggle drugs into Mexico.

00:13:09.414 --> 00:13:12.959
-I don't know, baby. Screw it.
-What?

00:13:13.042 --> 00:13:15.169
Can we for once, just in our lives,

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:18.965
just say "screw it" to all the plans
and just get on a damn boat?

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:23.011
Look at it. It's kind of amazing.

00:13:23.594 --> 00:13:25.179
[scoffs]

00:13:25.263 --> 00:13:27.890
Look. The only reason I'm gonna do this
is 'cause I love you.

00:13:27.974 --> 00:13:29.017
Mm-hmm.

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:30.601
And it's because you my fiancée now.

00:13:30.685 --> 00:13:31.936
-Fiancée?
-Yeah.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.022
-Well, I like the sound of that.
-Yeah.

00:13:34.105 --> 00:13:34.939
Mmm.

00:13:35.857 --> 00:13:37.400
-We do too.
-Jesus!

00:13:37.483 --> 00:13:39.277
-Fiancée.
-[chuckles]

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.196
Look, thanks for the offer, okay?
We're-- We're in.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.574
-Fuck yeah! Yeah!
-Yay! Guys--

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.243
[Latin pop music playing]

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:53.166
Goddamn, sailing makes my dick hard.
I'm almost at half-mast.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.585
Okay, man. Where did you learn
to sail a boat like this?

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.337
[Ron] I did cleanup work
off Malaysia one summer.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.505
Learn all kinds of stuff
when you're at sea.

00:13:59.589 --> 00:14:03.092
Look at that bird. You know I can tell
from here that bird's about to shit.

00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.261
Watch.

00:14:06.095 --> 00:14:07.347
[squawks]

00:14:08.806 --> 00:14:09.640
Ugh.

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:14.520
What type of skill set do you gotta have
just to predict when a bird gonna shit?

00:14:15.521 --> 00:14:16.814
It's weird, but it's impressive.

00:14:16.898 --> 00:14:18.149
I'll take it.

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:20.151
So, you said you were a nurse, right?

00:14:20.234 --> 00:14:21.736
No. [laughs]

00:14:21.819 --> 00:14:26.532
I am more of, like,
an assistant to Dr. Adolphus.

00:14:26.616 --> 00:14:28.701
-Interesting name.
-I know, right?

00:14:28.785 --> 00:14:30.578
He's had to change it, like,
a million times

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.622
because the Feds are always after him.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.458
But what can I say?
The benefits are really worth it.

00:14:36.542 --> 00:14:39.587
-Like what? Good insurance?
-[chuckles]

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.048
-Free pills.
-[chuckles]

00:14:42.131 --> 00:14:43.883
Hey, Marcus. Want to take her for a spin?

00:14:43.966 --> 00:14:47.095
No, I don't-- I don't--
I don't drive boats. I don't sail.

00:14:47.178 --> 00:14:49.597
Then who's gonna drive the boat?
'Cause I'm not driving.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.225
-There's no one driving the boat.
-Man, are you out your fucking mind?

00:14:52.308 --> 00:14:54.310
-Hey, man! What's wrong with you?
-Look at you.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:56.187
-Look at me do what?
-You're driving the boat.

00:14:56.270 --> 00:14:57.522
-Who's driving the boat?
-You are.

00:14:57.605 --> 00:14:59.357
-I'm driving the boat?
-Scoot over. Scoot over.

00:14:59.941 --> 00:15:01.025
Here.

00:15:01.609 --> 00:15:02.610
Hands off.

00:15:02.693 --> 00:15:04.612
[chuckling] Whoa.

00:15:04.695 --> 00:15:06.489
That's a lot smoother
than I thought it was gonna be.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:07.657
Yeah, man, relax.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:09.992
Feel the wind in your hair.

00:15:10.576 --> 00:15:11.911
We have different hair.

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:13.955
No, it's all good.
I can still feel the wind…

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:15.915
on my face.

00:15:16.582 --> 00:15:17.834
[chuckles]

00:15:17.917 --> 00:15:18.876
For the captain.

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.588
[Marcus] Thanks, man.

This is living.

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.515
Goddamn, I need a tequila.

00:15:32.598 --> 00:15:33.641
You want one? I'm pouring.

00:15:33.724 --> 00:15:35.810
-Chilled or straight up?
-Yeah, I'll take a tequila.

00:15:35.893 --> 00:15:38.771
Nice. Just, uh,
keep an eye out for the rocks.

00:15:38.855 --> 00:15:41.023
Yeah, I'll take it on the rocks too.
Thank you.

00:15:42.567 --> 00:15:44.944
Oh, yeah. I'm gonna have it chilled
and on the rocks.

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:46.946
It's gonna be extra cold. [laughs]

00:15:48.072 --> 00:15:48.906

You feel that?

That's all me, your fiancé.

-[Kyla screams]
-[Marcus screams]

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.480
[all screaming]

00:16:20.563 --> 00:16:23.566
[screaming]

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:26.861
[rescue technician speaking Spanish]

00:16:28.237 --> 00:16:29.489
[emergency radio chatter]

00:16:31.324 --> 00:16:34.452
Oh, my God, baby.
Baby, I'm so glad you're okay.

00:16:34.535 --> 00:16:38.247
Look-- Look, y'all. I'm so--
I'm-- I'm so sorry, okay?

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:41.542
I don't-- I don't know what happened.
I'm usually the careful guy.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:44.086
-I don't-- I don't even know what to say.
-I do.

00:16:46.589 --> 00:16:49.425
[together] That was fucking awesome!

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:50.635
-[Ron] Oh!
-Whoa.

00:16:50.718 --> 00:16:52.929
Y'all not mad at me
for crashing your boat?

00:16:53.012 --> 00:16:55.389
Mad? Are you kidding me?
Come on. Nobody's dead, right?

00:16:55.473 --> 00:16:57.433
Plus, you guys,
how lame would our story be

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.852
if it was just, like,
"a regular old day of sailing"?

00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:01.270
-[laughs]
-You flipped a catamaran!

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:03.523
Look, look.
I know that boat cost you a ton of money.

00:17:03.606 --> 00:17:04.607
-No, man.
-No.

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.859
The rental guy made us sign, like,
a billion papers.

00:17:06.943 --> 00:17:09.153
Dude, insurance. He
probably made money.

00:17:09.237 --> 00:17:11.030
There's nothing wrong with giving back.

00:17:11.113 --> 00:17:13.950
No, no, no! Please,
there's gotta be something I can do.

00:17:14.033 --> 00:17:17.411
Yeah, there is.
You're buying the first round.

00:17:17.495 --> 00:17:18.579
-[Kyla] Whoo!
-[Ron] Yes!

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:21.123
[Kyla whoops]

00:17:21.207 --> 00:17:23.876
[Latin hip-hop music playing]

00:17:25.127 --> 00:17:26.462
[laughing]

00:17:27.421 --> 00:17:29.131
[cheering]

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.010
[Ron] Hook me up. Hook me up.

00:17:41.811 --> 00:17:43.771
[Ron] There we go. Yeah!

00:17:44.772 --> 00:17:47.316
-Come on! Bring it in.
-Whoo!

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.401
Drink!

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:50.653
[Kyla] Wahoo!

00:17:50.736 --> 00:17:53.614
-<i>¡Viva la revolución!</i>
-[cheering]

00:17:54.532 --> 00:17:56.158
[Ron] Line 'em up! Let's do it!

00:17:56.242 --> 00:17:58.744
-Wow. One more?
-[cheering continues]

00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:07.920
[all] <i>Uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco, seis.</i>

00:18:08.004 --> 00:18:10.464

<i>¡Cincuenta y cinco!</i> Come on, baby!
<i>Cien! Cien!</i> Yeah!

00:18:14.719 --> 00:18:16.012
-Whoo!
-[screams]

00:18:21.183 --> 00:18:23.227
Yo, you're not gonna step in and help?

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:24.312
Her or him?

00:18:25.313 --> 00:18:27.857
-[grunts]
-Fuck you, you baby-faced little bitch!

00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.275
-To any motherfuckers here!
-Check.

00:18:29.358 --> 00:18:31.861
-[Kyla] I don't care if I kill you!
-[all shouting]

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:32.862
Fuck you!

00:18:32.945 --> 00:18:36.073
-[Ron] Come on!
-[Kyla] Come on, Marcus! Yeah! Come on!

00:18:36.157 --> 00:18:37.158
Whoo!

00:18:38.993 --> 00:18:40.786
[Kyla, Ron] Whoo!

00:18:43.497 --> 00:18:44.749
[cheering]

00:18:44.832 --> 00:18:46.417
-Are you kidding me? Come on.
-Hey!

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.877
Anybody could do this.

00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:50.546
Hey, <i>padre</i>. How much is it
to get somebody in the ring?

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.464
Ooh!

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:56.594
No, no, no. No. No, no, no, no.
[grunts] No, no, no.

00:18:58.387 --> 00:18:59.889
[grunts]

00:18:59.972 --> 00:19:01.641
-[cheering]
-[laughs]

00:19:01.724 --> 00:19:03.601
-Yeah!
-[cheering continues]

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:09.607
[Kyla, Emily chanting]

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:12.610
[Kyla, Emily cheering]

00:19:12.693 --> 00:19:15.363
[Kyla] Yes! [laughs]

00:19:15.446 --> 00:19:19.492
[Emily] It is going to be real hard
to go back to the real world tomorrow.

00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:21.494
-I know.
-[groans]

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.788
I mean, I'm looking forward to
planning my wedding,

00:19:23.871 --> 00:19:25.456
-but it is gonna be a shit show.
-Mmm.

00:19:25.539 --> 00:19:28.209
You know, that's exactly why
Ron and I never got hitched.

00:19:28.292 --> 00:19:31.504
Oh. I guess-- I guess I just assumed
you guys already were.

00:19:31.587 --> 00:19:35.049
No. Spiritually, we've probably been
married six or seven times,

00:19:35.132 --> 00:19:37.259
but like "governmentally,"
you know, with the license,

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:39.178
we just never really saw the point.

00:19:39.261 --> 00:19:40.429
Not even for kids?

00:19:40.513 --> 00:19:42.139
Kids aren't in the cards for us.

00:19:42.223 --> 00:19:46.852
I mean, we'd obviously be incredible
parents, but it's not gonna happen.

00:19:47.353 --> 00:19:49.355
[laughing]

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.023
Would you look at those two?

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:56.070
I mean, 'cause I have never seen Marcus
this relaxed. [chuckles] It's amazing.

00:19:56.153 --> 00:19:58.280
-[whispers] Emily.
-What?

00:19:59.615 --> 00:20:01.158
I'm Ron's prisoner.

00:20:01.909 --> 00:20:02.952
What are you talking about?

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:06.038
I've been trying to find the time to get
you alone, but I haven't been able to.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:09.125
Emily, he abducted me from a shopping
mall when I was 12.

00:20:09.208 --> 00:20:11.711
Okay? He's completely
crazy. He has a gun.

00:20:11.794 --> 00:20:13.129
-A gun?
-Yeah. Shh.

00:20:13.212 --> 00:20:16.549
He's-- He's made me live in a basement.
He's made me eat cat food.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:19.510
And he makes me go to the bathroom
in a little lawn chair with a hole in it.

00:20:19.593 --> 00:20:22.012
-What the hell? Why?
-I need to find a way to get his gun.

00:20:22.096 --> 00:20:23.848
-We can't--
-We're not safe!

00:20:23.931 --> 00:20:25.933
-What the hell?
-[laughs]

00:20:26.016 --> 00:20:28.018
-I got you.
-You were really jok-- You're such--

00:20:28.102 --> 00:20:29.937
-You're the worst.
-I just got you.

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.064
-[Emily] That was not funny.
-[Kyla] It was really funny.

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:34.400
-I can't believe you…
-Nah, man, I'm sorry. I keep forgetting.

00:20:34.483 --> 00:20:37.695
No, you know what?
Fuck it. Come on. Give it to me.

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.113
We're having a good time.

00:20:40.614 --> 00:20:42.533
[chuckling]

00:20:42.616 --> 00:20:44.285
Yeah. [chuckles]

00:20:45.202 --> 00:20:46.620
[sighs]

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:50.541
You know, when we first saw y'all
on this trip, we thought y'all was crazy.

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:54.628
I mean, I was right.
I mean, y'all are, like, fucking nuts.

00:20:54.712 --> 00:20:56.964
-[chuckles]
-But-- But in a good way, man.

00:20:58.048 --> 00:20:59.300
I'm glad I met you, Ron.

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:01.927
Like for real.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:05.431
Put that thing away.

00:21:06.223 --> 00:21:08.434
Put what away? What are we doing?

00:21:10.144 --> 00:21:11.145
<i>Salaam.</i>

00:21:14.398 --> 00:21:16.859
A kiss on the forehead is
the ultimate sign of respect.

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.444
I learned that from a sheikh in Kuwait.

00:21:18.527 --> 00:21:20.696
A forehead kiss is really intimate.
You know that, right?

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:21.989
Like, I almost proposed to you.

00:21:22.072 --> 00:21:24.450
-[laughs]
-[chuckles]

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.453
-Nice.
-Mmm.

00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:30.748
-Where should I get rid of this then?
-I'll show you.

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:34.043
Hey, ladies. Come here. Check this out.

00:21:35.252 --> 00:21:38.631
-Oh, shit, man. What the fuck?
-Oh, my God. He really does have a gun.

00:21:39.715 --> 00:21:41.717
Yeah, babe. I wouldn't lie about that.

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:44.512
It's a gift from my buddy Charlie.
I take it everywhere.

00:21:44.595 --> 00:21:46.764
Man,
you scared the shit out of me with that.

00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:47.848
What does this mean?

00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:49.683
[Ron] <i>De oppresso liber.</i>

00:21:49.767 --> 00:21:52.770
It's a phrase that has special meaning
to people such as myself, Marcus.

00:21:53.270 --> 00:21:54.939
A reminder
that a powerful weapon like this

00:21:55.022 --> 00:21:57.149
should only be used
when absolutely necessary.

00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:02.655
Now, put that bottle on your head.
I'm gonna shoot it off.

00:22:02.738 --> 00:22:05.032
-Yes! [grunts]
-Whoo!

00:22:05.115 --> 00:22:08.202
No. Hold on one second. Hold on a
second. Guys, no. Seriously, stop playing.

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:10.287
It's fine.
We play this game at home all the time.

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.581
Babe, he's not serious.
We been drinking and we been smoking.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.667
-I don't-- No, no, no.
-[screams]

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:15.835
Count it!

00:22:16.544 --> 00:22:19.380
What the fuck?

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:20.631
You hit the bottle this time!

00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:23.050
-[laughs]
-Oh, my God.

00:22:23.634 --> 00:22:26.637
[laughing hysterically]

00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:29.974
[chuckles] Yes!

00:22:30.057 --> 00:22:33.561
[both laughing]

00:22:33.644 --> 00:22:35.187
Oh, my God!

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:37.398
-Do me!
-Whoa, wait, what?

00:22:37.481 --> 00:22:38.482
Yeah. Your turn, go.

00:22:40.568 --> 00:22:41.569
[laughs]

00:22:42.486 --> 00:22:44.029
[Marcus] Hey, man, you sure you okay?

00:22:44.113 --> 00:22:47.449
[Ron] The bullet just grazed me. I'm not
gonna let a little scratch ruin my night.

00:22:47.533 --> 00:22:50.327
I mean, look at the four of us.
This is magical, isn't it?

00:22:50.411 --> 00:22:51.453
Mmm.

00:22:51.537 --> 00:22:53.289
You know what's crazy, you guys?

00:22:53.998 --> 00:22:58.377
Ron and I are the only two people on the
planet that know that y'all are engaged.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.254
Ah, I wish it could stay that way.

00:23:00.921 --> 00:23:02.089
I mean, to be honest,

00:23:02.172 --> 00:23:04.717
there's a lot of people
that really wouldn't be happy for us.

00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.801
[together] What?

00:23:06.302 --> 00:23:08.262
-Who?
-Look, her dad hates me, y'all. For real.

00:23:08.345 --> 00:23:10.472
-[Emily] Okay, not hates.
-What?

00:23:10.556 --> 00:23:13.684
He just don't think I'm good enough
to marry his perfect-ass daughter.

00:23:13.767 --> 00:23:15.811
-[Emily] Perfect da-- Who? Me?
-[Marcus] Yes, you.

00:23:15.895 --> 00:23:18.147
Okay, listen, no.
My dad's a little tough, yes.

00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:21.525
I mean, he is the dean
of Emory Business School,

00:23:21.609 --> 00:23:23.402
so he's a little traditional.

00:23:23.485 --> 00:23:25.779
I literally don't understand
what you're saying right now.

00:23:25.863 --> 00:23:27.406
This is Marcus we're talking about!

00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:32.119
I know. It's insane! How could anyone
not, like, absolutely love you?

00:23:32.202 --> 00:23:33.037
You're the best.

00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:34.622
[Marcus] Her father holds
all these things against me.

00:23:34.705 --> 00:23:36.165
Like, number one, you know,

00:23:36.248 --> 00:23:39.126
he looks down on me because
I had a failed marriage before, right?

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:41.170
Things don't work out. It is what it is.

00:23:41.253 --> 00:23:44.590
Number two, he treats me like
I'm some regular construction worker.

00:23:44.673 --> 00:23:47.384
I own my own construction company.
I'm my own boss.

00:23:47.468 --> 00:23:48.802
This doesn't seem justified.

00:23:48.886 --> 00:23:50.763
Yeah, but strike three, I'ma be honest.

00:23:50.846 --> 00:23:53.057
I did punch her brother in the face
at her mama's birthday party.

00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:54.141
-Got it.
-There's that.

00:23:54.224 --> 00:23:56.977
Well, my dad never got to meet Ron.

00:23:57.061 --> 00:23:58.354
Oh, no!

00:23:58.437 --> 00:23:59.605
Sorry, did he die?

00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:01.732
No. San Quentin's just so far.

00:24:01.815 --> 00:24:04.568
I got it. Wait, I got it.
I got it. I freaking got it.

00:24:04.652 --> 00:24:06.487
-What?
-Do it tonight.

00:24:06.570 --> 00:24:07.780
-[Kyla gasps]
-Wait. Do what tonight?

00:24:07.863 --> 00:24:10.032
-Get married tonight! Here!
-Get married! Tonight!

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:11.533
Yes! Right! Tonight, you guys!

00:24:11.617 --> 00:24:13.285
Wait, why would we do that?

00:24:13.369 --> 00:24:14.912
[Ron] You said
your family wouldn't approve.

00:24:14.995 --> 00:24:17.289
You'll be surrounded by friends
that love and support you.

00:24:17.373 --> 00:24:19.041
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-Friends!

00:24:19.124 --> 00:24:20.292
It's a wedding just for you guys.

00:24:21.168 --> 00:24:22.795
[Ron] Come on. I know the perfect guy.

00:24:22.878 --> 00:24:25.881
[chanting in Mayan]

00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.135
Baby. Baby,
do you think this is legally binding?

00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:33.347
Somehow I don't think so.
But just go with it.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.351

He's asking if you brought your <i>suku'un</i>.

00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:42.064
Wh-What's that?

00:24:42.147 --> 00:24:44.149
In Mayan ritual,
<i>suku'un</i> is like your brother.

00:24:45.025 --> 00:24:47.778
-Like a spiritual best man.
-Mm-hmm.

00:24:48.988 --> 00:24:52.324
Well, I guess you my <i>s-- su-suk--</i>

00:24:52.408 --> 00:24:56.036
Marcus.
You don't say that if you don't mean it.

00:24:56.787 --> 00:24:58.497
I-I-I do mean it.

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:02.001
And, uh, you don't have to be
so intense about it. Just chill out.

on a regular bottle.

That's not even a cork!

of us are too good together not to!

Yes! Oh, my God. You guys should come
out for the Oregon State Fair next month!

00:30:31.663 --> 00:30:35.459
Yeah! It's in Oregon. We go every year.
Last year, we took a double dose of DMT.

00:30:35.542 --> 00:30:37.586
Yeah, don't worry. It's all natural.

00:30:37.669 --> 00:30:40.088
It's just the chemical your brain releases
when you die.

-Okay.

00:30:41.882 --> 00:30:42.799

-Oh, my God.

I had a phone, but we'll take
your information. How about that?

00:30:55.354 --> 00:30:56.980
-Oh, my God. Yes! Yes.
-Yeah! Of course.

-[Emily] Wow.

So, when you call that,
that's gonna ring in the ranger's station.

00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:04.988
Then somebody comes to get me
outta the cave.

00:31:05.072 --> 00:31:07.324
Oh, before I forget,
let me give your sunglasses back.

No, man. Keep 'em.

Why you want me to keep 'em?
They're yours.

00:31:11.661 --> 00:31:12.913
No, they're ours.

[Marcus] Yeah. You know--

00:31:19.294 --> 00:31:21.880
It would be nice if, you know,
you keep what--

00:31:21.963 --> 00:31:25.425
what happened here… here.

00:31:25.509 --> 00:31:26.510
Marcus,

00:31:26.593 --> 00:31:29.596
if you're worried about the catamaran,
don't worry about it. I got you, dude.

00:31:29.679 --> 00:31:32.432
Care about the boat? I'm talking about
everything-- I'm talkin' about all of it.

00:31:32.516 --> 00:31:34.935
Are you kidding?
I'm gonna remember this week forever.

00:31:35.018 --> 00:31:36.103
[Marcus] What? Oh.

00:31:37.062 --> 00:31:40.857
It's been so special.
I love, love, love, love, love, love you.

-Bring it in.
-Oh. Mmm.

Get in here.

-Okay. [chuckles]
-[Kyla] Oh.

00:31:52.327 --> 00:31:55.914
Marcus. Thank you so much
for being so cool about everything.

00:31:57.332 --> 00:31:58.500
About what?

00:31:59.042 --> 00:32:00.252
Last night.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:06.675
Marcus, it was life-changing.

00:32:09.386 --> 00:32:12.806
Okay. Baby, we should go. [chuckles]
Farewell. Take care.

-Hey, somebody stop those two!

I think I see some human trafficking!
[chuckles]

00:32:22.274 --> 00:32:25.360
Hey. Why did you say see you later?
That leaves the door open.

00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:27.654
I don't know. I was trying to be vague.

00:32:28.196 --> 00:32:30.615
And who says "farewell"?
What are you? Othello?

00:32:30.699 --> 00:32:33.034
Farewell sounds final, okay?

00:32:33.118 --> 00:32:35.036
I don't wanna see those freaks again.
Do you?

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.913
I don't know. They were kinda fun.

00:32:36.997 --> 00:32:39.207
Yes, on vacation. Not in the real world.

00:32:39.291 --> 00:32:41.835
But they did loosen us up a little bit.

00:32:41.918 --> 00:32:44.671
Yes,
they may have loosened us up a little bit,

00:32:44.754 --> 00:32:46.214
but speaking of gettin' loose.

00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:49.259
Do you remember anything
that happened last night?

00:32:51.595 --> 00:32:54.723
Mm-mmm.
After the ceremony, it was all a blur.

00:32:55.223 --> 00:32:57.851
But-- But was it
that type of blur that, um--

00:32:57.934 --> 00:33:01.188
That some moments are, like--
like, insanely clear?

00:33:01.271 --> 00:33:02.564
[Emily] Hmm.

00:33:03.565 --> 00:33:05.150
You know, now that you mention it.

00:33:06.985 --> 00:33:09.154
No, all a blur.

00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:15.285
Oh. Well, it was a--
It's all a blur for me too. [chuckles]

00:33:15.368 --> 00:33:17.579
There's nothing clearly I remember at all.

00:33:17.662 --> 00:33:18.914

00:33:40.477 --> 00:33:42.687
Now, look. Whenever we off-load
materials on the site,

00:33:42.771 --> 00:33:45.148
what we do is, we log on here
and put it on this spreadsheet.

00:33:45.232 --> 00:33:47.108
This is the way we keep tabs
with the inventory.

00:33:47.192 --> 00:33:49.819
Yeah, but why can't we just write it
in the book like we used to?

00:33:49.903 --> 00:33:52.822
The problem is, I can't log on to a book
when I'm in Atlanta, right?

00:33:52.906 --> 00:33:55.492
I need to be on the cloud
so I can see what you clowns are doing.

00:33:55.575 --> 00:33:57.160
It's almost like you don't trust us.

00:33:57.244 --> 00:33:59.704
It's almost like
I don't trust y'all anymore? [chuckles]

00:33:59.788 --> 00:34:01.998
Guess what?
I do trust y'all, to screw shit up.

00:34:02.082 --> 00:34:03.667
That's why I'm only gone for a week.

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:05.627
Oh, I can fuck a lot of shit up in a week.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:07.170
I 100% believe that. You s--

00:34:07.254 --> 00:34:09.548
Yo, Marcus.
Fred and Enzo are fighting again.

00:34:09.631 --> 00:34:11.174
What? [groans] Damn it.

00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:14.511
-Let's go. Hands up. Let's go.
-You think I'm scared of you, bro?

00:34:14.594 --> 00:34:17.681
I ain't scared of you. Think I'm playing
with you? I ain't playing with you.

00:34:17.764 --> 00:34:18.598
Cut it out!

00:34:18.682 --> 00:34:20.600
Stop it! Okay, what is this all about?

00:34:20.684 --> 00:34:21.726
He's trying to steal my shit.

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:23.353
Fuck you. I had this crane booked.

00:34:23.436 --> 00:34:25.063
You should have logged it
in the spreadsheet.

00:34:25.146 --> 00:34:27.190
You just learned
about spreadsheets, okay? Chill.

00:34:27.274 --> 00:34:30.151
Why y'all arguing about a damn crane?
One of y'all could use the sidelifter.

00:34:30.235 --> 00:34:31.236
This one's special.

00:34:33.488 --> 00:34:35.282
[Marcus] What you mean this one is--

00:34:35.365 --> 00:34:37.033
[laughing]

00:34:37.117 --> 00:34:38.785
You gotta be kiddin' me. Come on, now.

00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:40.287
It's a Hugo Boss.

00:34:40.370 --> 00:34:43.999
We were thinking Vera Wang, but decided
this one's better for your build.

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:45.000
Hey, man.

00:34:45.083 --> 00:34:46.418
Wow, look at this.

00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:47.836
Yo, this is dope, man.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:50.714
Like, honestly, thank y'all.
I really appreciate this.

00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:53.466
And look, y'all-- Y'all do understand why
you can't come to the wedding, right?

00:34:53.550 --> 00:34:55.802
Yeah. You're embarrassed by us.

00:34:55.885 --> 00:34:58.555
-No. Have you met her parents?
-No, because you won't let us.

00:34:58.638 --> 00:35:00.140
Okay, look, if it was up to me,

00:35:00.223 --> 00:35:03.018
I would invite every last one of y'all
to the wedding, but I can't.

00:35:03.101 --> 00:35:04.728
Her parents said
they just want family there.

00:35:04.811 --> 00:35:06.354
They want it to be really intimate.

00:35:06.438 --> 00:35:09.482
[big band music playing]

00:35:09.566 --> 00:35:11.026
[Marcus] Baby, what is this?

00:35:11.109 --> 00:35:13.194
What happened to intimate?
Who's all these people?

00:35:13.778 --> 00:35:17.407
As far as I'm concerned,
we got married in a Mexican cave.

00:35:18.116 --> 00:35:19.618
So if you wanna bail, I'm down.

00:35:19.701 --> 00:35:21.745
Really? We can-- We can do that?

00:35:21.828 --> 00:35:23.496
Mm-mmm. No, we can't.

00:35:25.540 --> 00:35:26.541
[music ends]

00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:28.668
[chattering]

00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:31.046
Oh, there they are.

00:35:31.129 --> 00:35:34.507
Marcus,
I am so glad that you're finally here.

00:35:34.591 --> 00:35:35.967
Hey. Good seeing you too. [chuckles]

00:35:36.051 --> 00:35:39.346
And look at my girl. [chuckles] Oh.

00:35:39.429 --> 00:35:41.765
Please tell me
that you brought the dress I sent you.

00:35:41.848 --> 00:35:44.517
You only texted me about it
a million times. Yes, Mom, I did.

00:35:44.601 --> 00:35:45.477
-Oh, good.
-[Emily] Yes.

00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:49.439
Well, I want you all to remember
that this weekend is all about you.

00:35:49.522 --> 00:35:52.150
So I want you to have fun.

00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:53.693
Enjoy yourselves.

00:35:53.777 --> 00:35:56.404
Just remember to work the room
while everyone's here

00:35:56.488 --> 00:35:58.365
starting with Grandma Phyllis.

00:35:59.324 --> 00:36:01.368
[footsteps departing]

00:36:02.994 --> 00:36:06.206
Baby, is she sleeping with her eyes open?

00:36:07.332 --> 00:36:08.166
[Emily] Grandma.

00:36:08.792 --> 00:36:09.751
Grandma.

00:36:10.335 --> 00:36:11.795
-[whispering] Grandma.
-[wheezes]

00:36:11.878 --> 00:36:15.256
Oh, Emily. Is that you?

00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:16.633
Yeah, Grandma.

00:36:16.716 --> 00:36:18.051
Marcus, say hi.

00:36:19.636 --> 00:36:20.470
[loudly] Hi.

00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:23.556
Okay. Hey, Grandma,
why don't I go get you some tea?

00:36:24.307 --> 00:36:25.767
I'm-- I'm her fiancé, Marcus.

00:36:25.850 --> 00:36:27.268
[Emily] She's not deaf, Marcus.

00:36:27.352 --> 00:36:30.146
She didn't wake up.
You said her name five times. I don't--

00:36:31.731 --> 00:36:33.942
-[woman] Hey, girl.
-[man] Oh, my princess.

00:36:34.025 --> 00:36:35.735
-Oh.
-Hey.

00:36:35.819 --> 00:36:37.112
-[man] How are you?
-[Emily] I'm good.

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:38.196
[man] Okay, okay.

00:36:44.285 --> 00:36:45.620
Marcus.

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:50.875
Meet my colleagues.

00:36:50.959 --> 00:36:53.753
This is Albert Kim.
He's chair of our Public Policy program.

00:36:53.837 --> 00:36:57.465
And this is Dr. Gloria Alvarez.
She's head of Business Law.

00:36:58.216 --> 00:37:02.429
And this is, uh, Marcus.
He's a construction worker.

00:37:03.263 --> 00:37:04.472
It's nice to meet you.

00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:10.103
Well, Marcus, uh…
welcome to your wedding.

00:37:10.186 --> 00:37:12.772
Thanks for putting everything together.
I really appreciate this.

00:37:12.856 --> 00:37:14.524
I just sign the checks.

00:37:14.607 --> 00:37:16.109
[chuckles]

00:37:16.192 --> 00:37:19.988
[sighs] Well,
I suppose I put this off long enough.

00:37:22.115 --> 00:37:26.202
Now, these rings were passed on to me
by my grandparents,

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:31.082
so forgive me for being just
a little uneasy handing them over to…

00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:33.626
[sighs]

00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:35.295
…well, you.

00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:38.423
[Marcus] Wow, this, um--

00:37:38.506 --> 00:37:40.008
This actually means a lot.

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:42.719
And you can trust me.
I promise you, I'll take care of these.

00:37:42.802 --> 00:37:46.389
I hope so. Those represent a commitment
to my daughter.

00:37:46.473 --> 00:37:49.976
And I hope you take this far more
seriously than you did your last marriage.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.896
What makes you think I didn't take
my last marriage seriously?

00:37:52.979 --> 00:37:54.898
Damn, son. This some fancy shit.

00:37:54.981 --> 00:37:58.735
You done come a long way from drinkin'
40s on the stoop with little Jay and
Reggie.

00:37:58.818 --> 00:38:01.446
-Oh, stop. [laughs]
-Hey.

00:38:01.529 --> 00:38:05.658
Ooh, I'm so glad to be out that car.
Your father farting the whole way.

00:38:05.742 --> 00:38:08.161
[father]
You know I got the diverticulitis.

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:11.915
Anyway, good to see you, Harry.
We brought you a little something.

00:38:11.998 --> 00:38:13.041
Oh, thank you.

00:38:13.124 --> 00:38:17.212
Yeah, that's not the regular Hennessy.
That's VSOP, $71.

00:38:17.295 --> 00:38:18.630
[mother] Yeah, that was a set.

00:38:18.713 --> 00:38:20.215
It came with two glasses,

00:38:20.298 --> 00:38:23.676
but we kept those 'cause we thought
you had glasses. [laughs]

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:27.472
I think I see the councilman.
I should go say hello.

00:38:27.555 --> 00:38:28.640
-Oh. Yeah.
-I like that jacket.

00:38:28.723 --> 00:38:29.557
Yeah.

00:38:29.641 --> 00:38:31.476
And tell the councilman I say hi too.

00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:32.936
[laughing]

00:38:33.812 --> 00:38:35.855
Hey! Look, look.
Can y'all class it up a little bit?

00:38:35.939 --> 00:38:37.232
-I told you--
-What's your problem?

00:38:37.315 --> 00:38:39.359
We're just two men
having a conversation about cognac.

00:38:39.442 --> 00:38:41.611
No, I told you to put
the two glasses in there.

00:38:41.694 --> 00:38:42.904
-No.
-Hey.

00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:44.906
Look here. It's not about the glasses.

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:48.201
You talked about farting.
Nobody care about Dad's gas like that.

00:38:48.284 --> 00:38:50.620
And, Dad, you can't tell nobody
how much you spent on the gift.

00:38:50.703 --> 00:38:52.330
What's the point in spending
so much money then?

00:38:52.413 --> 00:38:55.291
-How about this. Go-- Go get some food.
-[mother] Mmm.

00:38:55.375 --> 00:38:57.794
It is so much food over there.
Y'all should go eat.

00:38:57.877 --> 00:38:59.420
-Well, let me just say this.
-Uh-oh.

00:38:59.504 --> 00:39:04.050
We will not talk to anyone else this
entire weekend if that's what you want.

00:39:04.133 --> 00:39:05.885
If that's what you want.
I'm not gonna embarrass you.

00:39:05.969 --> 00:39:07.345
-Ma, no.
-[father] See what you gone done?

00:39:07.428 --> 00:39:10.181
Believe me. We're not hungry.
We not gonna eat any of your food.

00:39:10.265 --> 00:39:12.642
-Ma. I know y'all hungry.
-You done messed up, boy.

00:39:12.725 --> 00:39:15.103
-Dad-- Could you talk to her for me?
-No, sir.

00:39:15.186 --> 00:39:16.187
Ma-- Ma.

00:39:16.271 --> 00:39:17.522
[jazz music playing]

00:39:17.605 --> 00:39:20.149
[chattering]

00:39:20.233 --> 00:39:22.026
-…not us.
-[laughs]

00:39:22.110 --> 00:39:24.654
-[sighs] You ready? Here we go.
-[man] Ladies and gentlemen,

00:39:24.737 --> 00:39:31.244
may I please present to you the bride
and groom-to-be, Emily and Marcus!

00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:33.663
[applause, cheering]

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:37.166
-Oh, good. Aw.
-You…

00:39:39.544 --> 00:39:41.337
How you doing?
Could I get a double scotch, please?

00:39:41.421 --> 00:39:43.172
-Of course.
-Hope you didn't order the punch.

00:39:43.256 --> 00:39:45.884
Get it? 'Cause you punched me.

00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:50.388
[chuckles]

00:39:50.471 --> 00:39:52.473
Brother-in-law. Hey, Gabe.

00:39:52.557 --> 00:39:54.893
Hey. You see this?

00:39:54.976 --> 00:39:58.855
Just know that this thing right here
could kill you in 32 different ways,

00:39:58.938 --> 00:40:01.190
and there's not a goddamn thing
you could do about it.

00:40:01.274 --> 00:40:04.527
Okay, man. What you-- What?
You been working out or somethin'?

00:40:04.611 --> 00:40:05.445
Nope.

00:40:06.946 --> 00:40:08.031
Yes. A little--

00:40:08.114 --> 00:40:09.115
Whatever. Listen.

00:40:09.198 --> 00:40:11.993
Just know that if you come at me
with another sucker punch,

00:40:12.076 --> 00:40:13.494
I'ma be ready for it this time.

00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:15.705
Gabe… [chuckles]
…I didn't sucker punch you.

00:40:15.788 --> 00:40:18.249
You was acting like a crazy person
over a flag football game.

00:40:18.333 --> 00:40:19.167
Yeah. Right.

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.754
You came in my face,
and you kept saying, "Punch me."

00:40:22.837 --> 00:40:25.381
-Yeah, because I didn't think you'd do it.
-Well, I did it, okay?

00:40:25.465 --> 00:40:29.844
And I'm sorry. I've apologized to you
a thousand times. Can't we just move on?

00:40:29.928 --> 00:40:31.596
-Put the past in the past, right?
-Yes.

00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:32.931
-Forget it.
-Forget about it.

00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:35.808
Yeah. Just-- Oh, but just in case
you get any ideas, I brought a friend.

00:40:35.892 --> 00:40:38.186
He owns a dojo where I train.
His name's Bennett.

00:40:38.269 --> 00:40:40.355
Bennett! Come here. Meet this guy.

00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:44.317
Oh, shit. There he is.

00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.402
-Marcus.
-Nice to meet you.

00:40:47.362 --> 00:40:49.238
-[Gabe] Yeah.
-Why's he here?

00:40:49.322 --> 00:40:52.283
Some people like to have friends
at life-changing events.

00:40:52.367 --> 00:40:53.826
-That's it.
-That's it.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:56.454
You would know if you had any friends.

00:40:56.537 --> 00:40:59.248
If you did, my mom and dad wouldn't
have forced me to be your best man.

00:40:59.332 --> 00:41:00.959
First of all, I don't like you.

00:41:01.042 --> 00:41:03.461
And I don't want you to be my best man
anyway, all right?

00:41:03.544 --> 00:41:06.381
I have great friends--
I have amazing friends, all right?

00:41:06.464 --> 00:41:08.591
You can't even handle any
of my friends. Okay?

00:41:10.218 --> 00:41:13.972
[guests scream, gasp]

00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:15.223
[murmuring]

00:41:15.306 --> 00:41:16.683
What the hell is that?

00:41:18.059 --> 00:41:21.604
[shaman chanting]

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:24.732
Oh, uh…

00:41:29.445 --> 00:41:30.738
Don't be alarmed--

00:41:30.822 --> 00:41:32.156
-Hey.
-Hi, yeah! Just a thing.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:35.118
You son of a bitch!
You said we were best friends.

00:41:35.201 --> 00:41:39.038
[Kyla] Yeah, the hell? You assholes. How
could you not invite us to your wedding?

00:41:39.122 --> 00:41:40.540
That's, like, fucked up!

00:41:42.875 --> 00:41:44.669
[both laughing]

00:41:44.752 --> 00:41:47.672
-[Kyla] Oh, my God! You look amazing.
-[Ron] Good to see you, man.

00:41:47.755 --> 00:41:50.925
-You look so gorgeous. Are you so
excited? -You been working out? Look at
you.

00:41:51.009 --> 00:41:53.177
-I mean-- And you. You look…
-[Kyla] Oh, my sweetheart!

00:41:53.261 --> 00:41:57.056
You guys smell the same. You smell
the same. Oh! I wanna kiss you!

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.599
What's-- What's-- What's goin' on here?

00:41:58.683 --> 00:42:00.184
-[chuckles]
-Oh, uh…

00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:02.061
-We lost the brakes around Marietta.
-Yeah.

00:42:02.145 --> 00:42:04.439
E-brake did the yeoman's work till
right about now.

00:42:04.522 --> 00:42:06.816
Yo, chief!
Just in case you need to move it.

00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:08.776
-[Kyla] Thank you.
-[chuckles]

00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:13.865
So, I think what Marcus is trying to ask
is what-- What are you two doing here?

00:42:13.948 --> 00:42:18.036
Oh! Well, you guys, we were so confused
why you didn't call after <i>México</i>.

00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:19.120
I mean, come on.

00:42:19.203 --> 00:42:22.498
We were literally sitting by the phone
for a week being like, "What?" [chuckles]

00:42:22.582 --> 00:42:26.002
But it was my bad.
'Cause the card I gave you. Old card.

00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:28.504
-You had no way to call.
-[Kyla] We did a little Internet stalking.

00:42:28.588 --> 00:42:32.341
Then we found out you guys were
registered at Williams-Sonoma in
beautiful Atlanta.

00:42:32.425 --> 00:42:33.426
From there, it was easy.

00:42:33.509 --> 00:42:35.636
Hit every wedding in Atlanta,
starting with downtown,

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.305
working our way out in concentric circles.

00:42:37.388 --> 00:42:40.683
Classic circle sweep maneuver. Same
thing I use to find lost kids in the cave.

00:42:40.767 --> 00:42:42.477
This time you weren't too late, sweetie.

00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:45.146
Hey, man. Get me up to speed.
What do you need from your best man?

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:46.189
[Kyla] Yay!

00:42:46.272 --> 00:42:47.440
Best-- Best man?

00:42:47.523 --> 00:42:50.443
Yeah. I mean, remember the shaman?

00:42:51.277 --> 00:42:52.111
I'm your <i>suku'un</i>.

00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:55.031
Ah!

00:42:55.114 --> 00:42:57.033
I do remember that, and, you know,

00:42:57.700 --> 00:42:59.118
and I couldn't--

00:42:59.202 --> 00:43:00.536
Because we couldn't reach you.

00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.913
[Marcus] We couldn't reach you.
I couldn't call you.

00:43:01.996 --> 00:43:03.873
-We were trying, but I was like…
-We were try-- We tried.

00:43:03.956 --> 00:43:06.209
…"If you'd like to make a call…"
Like, I'm trying to!

00:43:06.292 --> 00:43:08.544
-Wow, okay.
-So I had to get another best man.

00:43:08.628 --> 00:43:09.545
-[sighs] Yeah.
-Sorry.

00:43:09.629 --> 00:43:11.464
-What?
-What?

00:43:11.547 --> 00:43:12.965
-Who?
-My brother.

00:43:13.049 --> 00:43:14.217
-Yeah.
-Her-- her brother.

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:16.469
They are practically best friends.
Like, he loves him.

00:43:16.552 --> 00:43:19.180
And, you know,
we decided to do family-style.

00:43:19.263 --> 00:43:21.182
-Family. Keep it in the fam. [chuckles]
-[Emily] Mm-hmm. So…

00:43:21.265 --> 00:43:25.686
Two <i>suku'uns</i>.
I'll consult the sacred text. [mumbles]

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:27.313
-Okay, look. Look, I get it, right?
-[Emily sighs]

00:43:27.396 --> 00:43:30.399
You guys came all the way here,
and, you know, it took a long trip,

00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:33.486
and you-- you drove through a gate,
which is crazy, right?

00:43:33.569 --> 00:43:36.531
'Cause who gonna pay for that? Who?
'Cause that's not in the insurance.

00:43:36.614 --> 00:43:39.408
But that's besides the point.
The wedding is all full, man.

00:43:39.492 --> 00:43:41.077
It ain't-- it ain't no more room.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.121
-Nope. No. Like--
-And ain't nowhere to stay.

00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:46.374
Oh, who cares? We'll shack up
with you guys, Mexico-style!

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:48.126
Come on, you guys. Have you met us?

00:43:48.209 --> 00:43:50.670
We're so quiet.
Honestly, if we were sharing the same
room

00:43:50.753 --> 00:43:53.422
and you guys were doing
your little freaky, sexual… [babbles]

00:43:53.506 --> 00:43:55.216
…fuckfest post-nups--

00:43:55.299 --> 00:43:57.385
-Excuse me.
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

00:43:57.468 --> 00:43:58.678
Is that your truck?

00:43:59.345 --> 00:44:01.472
I'm sorry. This is a private event.

00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:04.725
It's cool. We know the bride and groom.
And you are?

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:06.435
I'm Harold Conway.

00:44:06.519 --> 00:44:07.645
That's my father.

00:44:07.728 --> 00:44:09.230
Oh, my gosh! Shut up.

00:44:09.313 --> 00:44:12.817
You're such a cutie. I feel like
I'm meeting a literal celebrity.

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:14.819
Hi. [chuckles] Okay!

00:44:14.902 --> 00:44:16.112
He's icy.

00:44:16.195 --> 00:44:19.866
I'm Ron. This is Kyla.
Met these two animals down in Mexico.

00:44:19.949 --> 00:44:22.785
Got to know each other.
Intimately. [chuckles]

00:44:22.869 --> 00:44:24.370
He didn't mean intimately. He meant…

00:44:24.453 --> 00:44:26.747
Are you wearing a military dress uniform?

00:44:26.831 --> 00:44:29.834
Oh. The buttons! [chuckles]
The buttons gave it away.

00:44:29.917 --> 00:44:32.086
And you are aware
that it's a federal offense

00:44:32.170 --> 00:44:34.172
to impersonate a member
of the US military?

00:44:34.255 --> 00:44:36.257
-Yes, I am.
-Then why are you wearing it?

00:44:39.552 --> 00:44:43.389
It's mine. I was in the Army.
I was a Green Beret.

00:44:43.472 --> 00:44:44.932
[Harold] Green Beret?

00:44:45.850 --> 00:44:46.851
Coin check.

00:44:51.314 --> 00:44:53.274
I haven't been coin checked in forever.

00:44:58.571 --> 00:45:00.114
[chuckling] I'll be damned.

00:45:01.115 --> 00:45:02.992
[chuckling] No way! What?

00:45:03.868 --> 00:45:06.579
[Harold] What a treat. [laughs]

00:45:06.662 --> 00:45:09.498
-Please, come on and join us.
-Okay. Wait. Harold, they can't stay.

00:45:09.582 --> 00:45:11.000
-Right?
-Daddy, that's what you told us.

00:45:11.083 --> 00:45:12.043
It's all full, right?

00:45:12.668 --> 00:45:14.879
We Green Berets always have
each other's back.

00:45:14.962 --> 00:45:15.963
Aw, yay!

00:45:16.047 --> 00:45:18.049
-Where did you serve, son?
-Four years in Saudi.

00:45:18.132 --> 00:45:19.550
Well, I was five in Laos.

00:45:19.634 --> 00:45:21.761
No shit.
Heard you guys had to put jimmy hats

00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:23.596
-on the barrels of your M16s!
-Oh, my God, man.

00:45:23.679 --> 00:45:26.015
They were so jam prone, we had to.
We didn't have the…

00:45:26.599 --> 00:45:30.144
How in the hell did they let that maniac
in the military?

00:45:30.228 --> 00:45:32.146
He's the most irresponsible person
I've ever met.

00:45:32.230 --> 00:45:33.898
And somehow, he is charming my dad.

00:45:33.981 --> 00:45:36.609
And then Charlie says,
"Take your fist out of there!"

00:45:36.692 --> 00:45:39.028
This is only happening because you said,
"See you later."

00:45:39.111 --> 00:45:41.822
I said it without meaning it,
like any decent person would.

00:45:41.906 --> 00:45:44.158
Damn it, look now. Now he did it--
Now he even got to your mama.

00:45:44.242 --> 00:45:46.744
-Oh, no, no.
-Look at your mom. She's smiling.

00:45:47.745 --> 00:45:49.664
-Oh, shit.
-[shaman chanting]

00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.749
What if he tells them
about our Mayan wedding?

00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:56.212
Oh, no, no, no.
What if he say anything about this trip?

00:45:56.295 --> 00:45:57.922
Oh, no.

00:45:58.005 --> 00:46:00.758
Okay, look. Okay, we got this.
We just gotta contain it.

00:46:00.841 --> 00:46:04.011
[chattering]

00:46:04.095 --> 00:46:06.013
Hey, uh, w-where are you guys going?

00:46:06.097 --> 00:46:07.890
Oh, I'm gonna show
Ron and Kyla their room.

00:46:07.974 --> 00:46:10.309
Wait, Harold.
I thought you said everything was full.

00:46:10.393 --> 00:46:13.229
[Harold] Everything was.
Except the Presidential Suite.

00:46:13.312 --> 00:46:14.313
So I splurged on it.

00:46:14.397 --> 00:46:17.233
-[Kyla] I'm so excited! You're my guy!
-[Harold laughs]

00:46:17.316 --> 00:46:19.902
Why wouldn't he do that for us?
We the ones getting married.

00:46:19.986 --> 00:46:22.822
Look, if you need anything,
please let me know.

00:46:22.905 --> 00:46:25.449
We will.
And… [sighs] …thanks again, Captain.

00:46:25.533 --> 00:46:29.245
Also, I hope you join us in the morning.
We have a little fox hunt lined up.

00:46:29.328 --> 00:46:32.164
-That's easy. Found her.
-[chuckles]

00:46:34.959 --> 00:46:36.252
[Harold] Oh.

00:46:36.335 --> 00:46:38.337
Darn it, I must have left the keys
at the front desk.

00:46:38.421 --> 00:46:40.214
-Stand down.
-Sir, yes, sir.

00:46:40.298 --> 00:46:41.424
[Kyla] Bye. That's so sweet.

00:46:41.507 --> 00:46:43.342
-[Emily] Thanks, Dad.
-[Harold] Be right back.

00:46:43.426 --> 00:46:47.430
-Okay, look. Um, could you do me a
favor? -Yeah.

00:46:47.513 --> 00:46:49.598
'Cause I'm trying to make
a good impression on her family.

00:46:49.682 --> 00:46:50.808
-Sure.
-Totally.

00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:55.354
It's that you don't mention anything
about the Mexico trip. Nothing.

00:46:55.438 --> 00:46:56.772
Nothing at all.

00:46:56.856 --> 00:46:58.357
Oh, Marcus. You're so funny.

00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:00.943
It's just one catamaran.
It's really not a big deal.

00:47:01.027 --> 00:47:02.820
Yeah, it's not about the catamaran. Okay?

00:47:02.903 --> 00:47:05.031
It's all the other crazy shit
that happened.

00:47:05.114 --> 00:47:08.784
All the insane shit,
it doesn't need to be mentioned here.

00:47:08.868 --> 00:47:09.869
At all.

00:47:09.952 --> 00:47:11.954
Okay, we got you. We got you.
It's just, um…

00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:17.209
Well, the, uh-- the crazy shit is one
of the reasons we came here.

00:47:17.293 --> 00:47:21.505
See, something happened,
and it's something intense. I just--

00:47:22.089 --> 00:47:28.179
Um, I went to the doctor,
and they found a growth in my abdomen.

00:47:28.262 --> 00:47:31.432
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:34.685
Yeah, and the doctor, I guess he says
it's-- it's only gonna get bigger.

00:47:36.228 --> 00:47:37.229
Can he operate on it?

00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:41.317
[crying] Unfortunately, they can't--
They can't. Sorry. They can't.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:45.613
The-- [clears throat] The doctors say
it's gonna come out on its own.

00:47:47.031 --> 00:47:48.240
Through her vagina.

00:47:48.324 --> 00:47:49.617
Huh?

00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:53.454
[chuckles]

00:47:53.537 --> 00:47:54.789
I'm preggers!

00:47:56.165 --> 00:47:58.084
That's how you're gonna make
that announcement?

00:47:58.167 --> 00:48:00.378
By-- By having us think
that you had cancer?

00:48:00.461 --> 00:48:02.671
-Yeah!
-Yeah! You guys. [chuckles]

00:48:02.755 --> 00:48:04.882
-Oh, congratulations, I guess.
-[Kyla] Thank you.

00:48:04.965 --> 00:48:06.342
Thank you.

00:48:06.425 --> 00:48:10.721
Guess, um… I'm really happy for you.

00:48:10.805 --> 00:48:13.599
Aw, thanks, pal.
Hey, that's not the whole story though.

00:48:13.682 --> 00:48:17.311
There's something about this baby
that has to deal with you directly.

00:48:20.981 --> 00:48:22.024
What do you mean?

00:48:22.108 --> 00:48:23.317
[Harold] Fubar!

00:48:24.235 --> 00:48:27.238
Fubar. My brain is absolutely fubar.

00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:29.698
I had the key in my other pocket
the whole time.

00:48:29.782 --> 00:48:30.908
[Kyla] You silly goose.

00:48:30.991 --> 00:48:32.451
-[Harold] Oh, God.
-[Kyla] You goofball.

00:48:32.535 --> 00:48:35.413
-Here we go.
-[Kyla] Yes.

00:48:36.831 --> 00:48:40.042
Oh, my God! This place is insane!

00:48:40.126 --> 00:48:41.919
[Ron] Permission to shit my pants,
Captain.

00:48:42.002 --> 00:48:44.380
[Harold] Permission granted. [chuckles]

00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:46.257
-[Ron] VCR!
-[sighs]

00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.634
-It's amazing!
-[Kyla] Ooh! I feel like Nancy Reagan.

00:48:48.717 --> 00:48:50.845
This should be our room.

00:48:51.929 --> 00:48:53.764
[Marcus whispering]
Mexico was seven months ago?

00:48:55.224 --> 00:48:56.475
Seven months?

00:48:57.852 --> 00:48:58.853
[Emily scoffs]

00:48:59.854 --> 00:49:00.938
Twice.

00:49:01.564 --> 00:49:03.858
Twice they've gotten
the Presidential Suite.

00:49:03.941 --> 00:49:05.234
How does this keep happening?

00:49:05.317 --> 00:49:06.652
[scoffs]

00:49:06.735 --> 00:49:09.196
-Baby, can I ask you something?
-Yes, babe.

00:49:09.822 --> 00:49:12.241
It's just a quick question.

00:49:12.324 --> 00:49:16.203
Just, I was wondering,
how far along did Kyla look to you?

00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:19.123
[chuckles] I don't know. Why?

00:49:19.206 --> 00:49:21.375
I mean, if you had to take a guess.
You know what I mean?

00:49:21.459 --> 00:49:24.086
Just a-- just-- just a guess.

00:49:25.254 --> 00:49:27.756
Oh, five months? Five and a half? Tops.

00:49:28.757 --> 00:49:29.925
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

00:49:30.009 --> 00:49:32.386
Yeah. Right. She five and a half months.

00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:35.389
She ain't-- She don't look
seven months at all, right? [chuckles]

00:49:35.473 --> 00:49:37.600
If she's seven months,
then I'm three months.

00:49:38.392 --> 00:49:39.435
And it's yours.

00:49:39.518 --> 00:49:40.561
[chuckling] Yeah, it's mine.

00:49:41.562 --> 00:49:43.314
-[Emily] Good night, love.
-Mm-hmm.

00:49:43.397 --> 00:49:44.440
-Mmm.
-[Marcus chuckles]

00:49:44.523 --> 00:49:47.693
[bugle playing]

00:49:47.776 --> 00:49:49.778
[dogs barking]

00:49:52.781 --> 00:49:54.116
[chuckles] Oh.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.993
Mr. Finnegan.

00:49:56.076 --> 00:49:59.079
You know, every time he does this,
I feel like I'm walking in on him.

00:49:59.955 --> 00:50:00.956
It's disgusting.

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:02.208
[Harold sighs]

00:50:02.291 --> 00:50:05.503
I'd like to thank you all for coming out
for this magnificent tradition:

00:50:05.586 --> 00:50:08.923
-the pursuit of the elusive gray fox.
-[horse whinnies]

00:50:09.006 --> 00:50:11.717
Now there are a couple of rules
that I'd like you to keep in mind.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.928
-One…
-Baby, do you see either of them?

00:50:14.011 --> 00:50:15.387
No, thank God.

00:50:15.471 --> 00:50:18.224
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.
I was trying to find the rest of my gear.

00:50:18.307 --> 00:50:19.558
-What the--
-[Kyla] Hey, lover!

00:50:19.642 --> 00:50:22.269
Look at what your girl found.

00:50:22.353 --> 00:50:23.437
-Whoo!
-Shh.

00:50:23.521 --> 00:50:26.106
It was in the truck the whole time.
It was just wedged under my seat.

00:50:26.190 --> 00:50:27.691
-You're the best.
-I know. I know.

00:50:27.775 --> 00:50:30.194
Oh. No, no, no. No guns.
No. No one's killing anything.

00:50:30.277 --> 00:50:31.320
-What?
-What?

00:50:31.403 --> 00:50:33.739
Yeah, it's not even a real fox hunt.
It's a fox chase.

00:50:33.822 --> 00:50:36.033
And no one's seen a fox
around here in years.

00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:39.495
By the way, Kyla, you're pregnant.
That means you're not coming.

00:50:39.578 --> 00:50:42.414
-Oh, fuck that.
-[dog barking]

00:50:42.498 --> 00:50:45.668
Excuse me! Lady in the purple.
How do I get one of those?

00:50:46.418 --> 00:50:48.546
Hey, chief.
Could you just get this to the front desk?

00:50:49.296 --> 00:50:51.006
Okay, baby. Let me get this straight.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:54.885
I spent the last three months waking up
at the crack of dawn

00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:57.429
to learn how to ride a horse
for a damn nature walk?

00:50:57.513 --> 00:50:59.223
And the most important rule of all…

00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:00.474
[barking continues]

00:51:00.558 --> 00:51:03.060
…have fun. [chuckles]

00:51:03.143 --> 00:51:06.397
["Ooh La La" playing]

00:51:22.871 --> 00:51:24.873
Nice grip. Solid trot.

00:51:25.666 --> 00:51:27.167
Marcus, I didn't realize you could ride.

00:51:27.251 --> 00:51:30.504
Oh, well, you know,
this ain't the tack that I'm used to.

00:51:30.588 --> 00:51:33.716
You know, I prefer western reins.
[chuckles]

00:51:33.799 --> 00:51:36.010
Oh, it's too bad you're wearing
the wrong jacket.

00:51:37.553 --> 00:51:40.431
Five buttons is strictly for houndsmen.
[clicks tongue]

00:51:40.514 --> 00:51:42.266
[dogs barking]

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:48.063
Harsh. I got like 12 buttons
on my cargo shorts.

00:51:48.856 --> 00:51:50.357
That guy really doesn't like you, huh?

00:51:50.441 --> 00:51:51.442
You think?

00:51:52.276 --> 00:51:54.278
You know what? We'll show him.

00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:59.325
Come on, Marcus.
Let's go find a goddamn fox.

00:51:59.408 --> 00:52:01.243
-[Marcus] Wait, what?
-[Ron] Let's do this!

00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:14.131
Look, man. This is a big waste of time.
We are not gonna find a fox.

00:52:14.214 --> 00:52:17.635
Let's just ride back to the stables,
get some food because I'm starving.

00:52:17.718 --> 00:52:19.720
[birds chirping]

00:52:21.013 --> 00:52:23.390
Hungry no more. [laughs]

00:52:24.308 --> 00:52:25.309
That is…

00:52:27.227 --> 00:52:28.228
Oh!

00:52:28.312 --> 00:52:29.563
…reindeer moss.

00:52:30.856 --> 00:52:32.191
One of the edible Cladonias.

00:52:34.109 --> 00:52:35.319
You gonna eat that shit?

00:52:35.402 --> 00:52:37.154
Yeah, dude. It's a superfood.

00:52:37.237 --> 00:52:40.282
And it only grows in a rare section
of the loblolly pine ecosystem.

00:52:40.366 --> 00:52:41.867
Okay, how you know all this weird crap?

00:52:41.950 --> 00:52:44.912
Licensed edible forager, man.
Any self-respecting ranger is.

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:45.996
Try some?

00:52:46.705 --> 00:52:48.624
Nah, I'm good on the tree pubes.

00:52:48.707 --> 00:52:50.834
[laughs]

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:51.919
Tree pubes!

00:52:52.002 --> 00:52:54.546
Why you laughing so hard?
It wasn't even that funny.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:56.965
You know, that--
that's a joke Charlie would say.

00:52:57.049 --> 00:52:59.093
Sometimes I can't even tell
the two of you apart.

00:52:59.176 --> 00:53:00.594
Here, check this out. [grunts]

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:05.099
There. Look. [laughing] There he is.
Look at that. You see?

00:53:06.850 --> 00:53:08.519
-That's Charlie?
-Yeah, that's Charlie.

00:53:08.602 --> 00:53:12.147
We look nothing alike, okay?
This is a pale white man with red hair.

00:53:12.231 --> 00:53:16.026
I'm not talking about his looks, man.
I'm talking about his spirit.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:19.113
You both got this hard shell
on the outside,

00:53:19.196 --> 00:53:21.824
then one bite
and you get to the gooey center.

00:53:22.324 --> 00:53:24.201
Now come on. Eat the moss.

00:53:26.537 --> 00:53:28.122
You're lucky I'm hungry.

00:53:32.626 --> 00:53:35.629
Okay. It's not that bad.

00:53:35.713 --> 00:53:38.465
Boom! Mind open.

00:53:39.883 --> 00:53:42.970
See, man. It's like
nature's crisper drawer out here.

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:46.223
Ooh! Some ramps!
The onion's wild cousin. [grunts]

00:53:48.058 --> 00:53:49.810
[chuckles] Try that.

00:53:49.893 --> 00:53:51.687
Oh, man.

00:53:52.354 --> 00:53:53.564
Jackpot.

00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.817
[chuckles]

00:53:56.900 --> 00:53:57.901
Oh, man.

00:54:00.154 --> 00:54:02.072
Okay, look.
I know you're not a big drug guy,

00:54:02.156 --> 00:54:05.159
but if you ever wanna unlock the doors to
perception, this, my friend, is the key.

00:54:05.242 --> 00:54:06.076
Wait, what?

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:08.829
Primarily found in Spain, but around here,
we call it the Devil's Dick.

00:54:09.496 --> 00:54:11.331
Most potent magic mushroom on Earth.

00:54:11.415 --> 00:54:13.876
You eat one of these babies,
not only will you talk to God,

00:54:13.959 --> 00:54:16.170
you'll find a rent-controlled apartment
and move in together.

00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:17.588
-I ate it.
-What?

00:54:18.422 --> 00:54:19.798
I ate it.

00:54:19.882 --> 00:54:21.508
-Why?
-You told me to!

00:54:21.592 --> 00:54:24.052
I said, "Jackpot," and that's it.
I didn't say, "Eat it."

00:54:24.136 --> 00:54:26.013
Man, you are crazy, okay?

00:54:26.096 --> 00:54:29.308
Everything you touch turn into drugs!

00:54:29.391 --> 00:54:30.809
Okay? What's gonna happen to me?

00:54:30.893 --> 00:54:32.060
Am I about to die?

00:54:32.144 --> 00:54:34.104
No, no. You're not gonna die. Okay?

00:54:34.188 --> 00:54:36.982
Part of you is gonna die,
but it's gonna be reborn. You'll be fine.

00:54:37.065 --> 00:54:39.026
Something's happening
because everything is purple now.

00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:41.612
No, no, no, no. You're being paranoid.
It takes 20 minutes to kick in.

00:54:41.695 --> 00:54:42.654
Everything's purple!

00:54:42.738 --> 00:54:43.739
Oh, shit.

00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:46.200
I guess only a rookie chasms that fast.

00:54:47.743 --> 00:54:49.119
You need a rope man. Okay.

00:54:50.829 --> 00:54:53.874
-Marcus, I'm going in with you.
-Mm-hmm.

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:56.835
Every step of the way.
[inhales deeply] Deep breaths.

00:54:56.919 --> 00:54:59.087
-[inhales] Okay.
-I mean, this is from me to you.

00:54:59.171 --> 00:55:03.091
You're a big guy. Focus. Concentrate.

00:55:04.092 --> 00:55:06.678
There is a good chance
that nothing's gonna happen.

00:55:06.762 --> 00:55:08.764
["So What'cha Want" playing]

00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:12.142
[both laughing]

-[music stops]
-[horse whinnies]

00:55:29.785 --> 00:55:31.036
[Kyla] Emily!

00:55:31.119 --> 00:55:33.747
I know I've only been here for a night,
but I've gotta say,

00:55:33.831 --> 00:55:35.249
this wedding is so kick-ass.

00:55:35.332 --> 00:55:36.959
Well, at least someone's enjoying it.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.043
[Kyla] How could you not?

00:55:38.126 --> 00:55:39.586
Your family's so freaking cool.

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:42.756
Everybody's in love with me,
and I haven't even met half of them yet.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:46.635
Yeah, uh, don't-- don't feel pressured,
like, to meet everyone.

00:55:46.718 --> 00:55:49.096
You're so sweet.
No, I promise you. You have my word.

00:55:49.179 --> 00:55:52.808
I'm gonna have meaningful connections
with literally every single person here.

00:55:52.891 --> 00:55:55.519
I was just so busy talking
to Grandma Phyllis last night

00:55:55.602 --> 00:55:57.187
that I couldn't make the rounds.

00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:59.690
No, Phyllis barely even speaks.

00:55:59.773 --> 00:56:02.484
She's a major, major
chatterbox deep down.

00:56:02.568 --> 00:56:05.988
Harold, I don't know if this is just
Grandma Phyllis starting shit,

00:56:06.071 --> 00:56:07.114
but… [chuckles]

00:56:07.197 --> 00:56:10.367
…she said that this wedding
was already more fun than yours was.

00:56:11.076 --> 00:56:12.202
That's not surprising.

00:56:13.996 --> 00:56:14.997
What does that mean?

00:56:17.165 --> 00:56:21.044
Well, um, there was a bit of tension
at our wedding.

00:56:21.962 --> 00:56:24.298
It wasn't Phyllis.
It was your grandfather and I.

00:56:24.381 --> 00:56:29.344
We just got off on the wrong foot,
and he never gave me another chance.

00:56:30.095 --> 00:56:31.221
That sounds familiar.

00:56:31.305 --> 00:56:34.892
Maybe now's the perfect time
for you to give Marcus another chance.

-[music resumes]
-Wow.

[wind whistling]

00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:50.157
[distorted] Did you hear that?

00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.367
[distorted] Oh… Oh, I heard that.
Did you hear that?

00:56:52.451 --> 00:56:54.453
I heard it. I didn't know I could hear--

00:56:54.536 --> 00:56:57.664
It's like, I know I can see shit,
but I didn't know I was hearing shit too.

[footsteps approaching]

00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:02.836
What is that?

00:57:04.546 --> 00:57:05.547
It's a fox.

00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.841
[chuckles]

00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:10.302
-It's a fox.
-It's gotta be a fox.

00:57:10.969 --> 00:57:12.721
[shaman chanting]

00:57:19.436 --> 00:57:21.063

00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:24.441
[whispering] Behind you.

00:57:33.617 --> 00:57:35.494
-Don't move.
-[whispering] Okay.

00:57:36.078 --> 00:57:37.496
Or make a sound.

00:57:37.579 --> 00:57:39.081
Don't say a single word.

00:57:39.164 --> 00:57:40.290
You're talking right now.

00:57:40.374 --> 00:57:41.375
No, I'm not.

00:57:43.752 --> 00:57:44.753
So what do we do?

00:57:44.836 --> 00:57:47.381
I'm gonna go make a snare
out of that flora.

00:57:49.049 --> 00:57:50.050
You stay here.

00:57:50.801 --> 00:57:52.970
What do you mean, "Stay here," Ron?
Where you going?

00:57:53.053 --> 00:57:55.389
Ron. Ron.

00:57:56.098 --> 00:57:57.099
Ron.

00:57:57.683 --> 00:57:59.059
Don't worry.

00:57:59.726 --> 00:58:02.229
Foxes are a completely
nonaggressive species.

00:58:02.312 --> 00:58:03.772
-[growling]
-[screaming]

00:58:04.690 --> 00:58:06.066
[Marcus] Get it off me!

00:58:06.149 --> 00:58:07.609
[dog barking]

00:58:07.693 --> 00:58:10.696
It's Mr. Finnegan. He spotted something!

00:58:12.364 --> 00:58:13.490
Mount up, everyone!

00:58:13.573 --> 00:58:15.450
[screaming continues]

00:58:15.534 --> 00:58:17.494
-Get off me!
-Grab it! Subdue it!

00:58:17.577 --> 00:58:20.288
Fuck that! Get it off me!

00:58:20.372 --> 00:58:22.457
-[growling]
-Fuck! Get it off!

00:58:29.047 --> 00:58:30.382
What are you doing?

00:58:30.465 --> 00:58:32.217
[growling continues]

00:58:34.052 --> 00:58:36.054
[horse whinnies]

00:58:43.729 --> 00:58:45.397
Mr. Finnegan likes him.

00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:50.235
What the fuck?

00:58:50.318 --> 00:58:51.820
[Harold] Mr. Finnegan. [whistles]

00:58:52.821 --> 00:58:54.573
[sighs] Marcus, are you okay?

00:58:54.656 --> 00:58:56.241
Sweetie, I will…

00:58:59.036 --> 00:59:00.412
Let me help you up there.

00:59:02.664 --> 00:59:03.749
[grunts]

00:59:04.332 --> 00:59:06.960
This isn't easy to say, Marcus,

00:59:07.878 --> 00:59:10.630
but I think we've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

00:59:10.714 --> 00:59:12.966
I see things my way, and--

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:15.427
[laughs]

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:16.845
What's so funny?

00:59:16.928 --> 00:59:18.430
You're a clown!

00:59:19.765 --> 00:59:21.808
-Excuse me?
-[Marcus] You're a clown.

00:59:22.934 --> 00:59:25.020
[laughs]

00:59:25.103 --> 00:59:27.856
Look, if I can interject
for just a second, Harold.

00:59:27.939 --> 00:59:29.900
Marcus and I have been talking
about you all weekend.

00:59:29.983 --> 00:59:31.902
-What? About my being a clown?
-[Ron] Yes.

00:59:31.985 --> 00:59:35.280
Yes, but, you know,
a wedding is like a big, old circus.

00:59:35.363 --> 00:59:38.450
And you, you're the star of the show.

00:59:38.533 --> 00:59:39.618
[Marcus] Oh, shit.

00:59:40.911 --> 00:59:43.121
-I'm made of metal.
-What-- What is going on here?

00:59:43.830 --> 00:59:47.876
Uh, what Marcus means is
that his commitment to your daughter…

00:59:49.044 --> 00:59:50.212
is as strong as steel.

00:59:51.171 --> 00:59:53.840
Captain, Marcus has told me many times
that he looks up to you.

00:59:54.841 --> 00:59:56.510
And he hopes that one day,

00:59:56.593 --> 00:59:59.596
you can all become a real, true family
despite your differences.

00:59:59.679 --> 01:00:00.680
No!

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:03.391
Because of them.

01:00:03.475 --> 01:00:04.434
He said that?

01:00:04.518 --> 01:00:05.644
He did. Word for word.

01:00:06.228 --> 01:00:07.229
You said that?

01:00:09.397 --> 01:00:10.440
Mm-hmm.

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:18.281
Lieutenant.

01:00:20.534 --> 01:00:21.535
Whatever.

01:00:22.994 --> 01:00:24.788
Oh, fuck. He bought it, dude. I can't--

01:00:25.539 --> 01:00:28.708
What the fuck? Metal? Come on. Shit.

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:30.460
-I'm in the circus.
-[huffs]

01:00:31.128 --> 01:00:33.964
[Marcus] Do you realize
I almost killed that dog? Fucking Ron.

01:00:34.047 --> 01:00:35.423
[Emily] Hey, cut him some slack.

01:00:35.507 --> 01:00:38.468
He actually covered for you with my dad.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:41.304
Like, he kind of saved your ass.

01:00:41.388 --> 01:00:43.557
Wait a minute.
Is Grandma Phyllis over there talking?

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.016
How's that even possible?

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.936
[Emily] Kyla has been really obsessed
with her lately.

01:00:48.019 --> 01:00:50.021
Uh-uh. This is not good.

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:52.357
[chuckles]

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.025
Damn, how many cousins I got?

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:56.111
Some happy cousins. Why they so happy?

01:00:56.194 --> 01:00:57.529
I don't know.

01:00:57.612 --> 01:00:59.406
Tell 'em I say hi. [chuckles]

01:01:07.956 --> 01:01:10.625
Hey, good morning, sleepyhead.
I was just getting this for you.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.878
A little something to get
those synapses firing.

01:01:14.129 --> 01:01:16.548
-Why? What you put in here?
-It's grapefruit juice.

01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:18.884
And heroin.

01:01:19.718 --> 01:01:22.262
Kidding. Just drink it.
You'll feel better.

01:01:23.013 --> 01:01:24.890
-Can I be honest with you, man?
-Yeah.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:27.017
I really don't get you.

01:01:27.684 --> 01:01:28.977
What's there to get?

01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:31.563
I mean, everywhere we go,
chaos happens. Right?

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.399
But everybody else panics, but not you.

01:01:34.482 --> 01:01:37.444
You stay calm and collected.
Like, you don't worry about any of it.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.154
One night in Green Beret training,

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:41.573
they woke us up, put us in a boat,
drove us a mile offshore,

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:43.408
dumped us in the water
and said, "Swim back."

01:01:44.117 --> 01:01:45.994
I watched so many guys
wear themselves out

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.038
swimming against the riptide
as hard as they could.

01:01:48.121 --> 01:01:53.668
They had to be extracted. Me?
I found out the trick was just float.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:57.422
Look, I've never been the type of person
that can just float, you know?

01:01:57.505 --> 01:01:58.965
Marcus, you're missing the point.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:03.053
Yeah, real story, but a metaphor, because
it has nothing to do with your body mass.

01:02:03.136 --> 01:02:05.472
I understand that. I mean,
I know what metaphors are. I was--

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.891
Do you? Do you?

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:11.978
If it isn't Special Forces
and special… stupid idiot.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.939
You're lucky you didn't hurt
my dad's dog yesterday,

01:02:14.022 --> 01:02:15.649
'cause if you did, I would've hurt you.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:19.319
Okay, Gabe. Is that right?
Right? You gonna kick my ass?

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.446
-You wanna go right here, right now?
-I think he wants to.

01:02:21.529 --> 01:02:22.781
'Cause we can do that.

01:02:22.864 --> 01:02:26.284
If I may. Gabe, it looks like
you're trying to lead with a power jab.

01:02:26.368 --> 01:02:28.828
Let's get those hips in. Get warmed up--

01:02:28.912 --> 01:02:31.248
Hey. What are you-- Hands off.

01:02:31.331 --> 01:02:32.457
Whoa! Okay, man. I'm just--

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:34.084
Listen, I'm not here to fight anyway.

01:02:34.167 --> 01:02:35.835
My father sent me here
to collect the rings.

01:02:35.919 --> 01:02:39.089
I guess the best man is supposed to
carry the rings, so that's why I'm here.

01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:46.638
You know something? I'ma give these to
my best man, but to my new best man,
Ron.

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:48.265
-Here you go, brother.
-You mean it?

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.433
-Can he do that?
-No, he cannot do that.

01:02:50.517 --> 01:02:53.603
It's already been done. That's right.
That's my best man right there.

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:57.357
Marcus, this means…
more to me than you'll ever know.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:02:59.901
[Marcus] Oh, man. It's all good, br--

01:03:02.821 --> 01:03:03.655
<i>Salaam.</i>

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:07.993
Whatever. Okay.

01:03:08.076 --> 01:03:09.744
See you at tee off, assholes.

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.291
I do not like the way they talk to you.

01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.295
All right. They gone.
You can give me the rings back.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.380
What? No. I-- You-- We just said-- What?

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.716
No, no. That--
I was doing that in front of them.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:25.218
I'm actually gonna keep the rings,
so you just give 'em back to me.

01:03:25.302 --> 01:03:28.221
Marcus, you made me your best man.
That's that. Best man holds the rings.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:30.598
Yes, I know what
"traditionally" the best man do--

01:03:30.682 --> 01:03:32.726
You can't just say
the best man holds the rings

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.936
and then not let
the best man hold the rings.

01:03:35.020 --> 01:03:36.104
I got you.

01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:42.861
Well, Marcus, good to have you back.

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.279
That sunstroke is no joke.

01:03:44.362 --> 01:03:49.617
So, people,
stay hydrated with-- with water.

01:03:49.701 --> 01:03:53.955
The marshals are very strict when it
comes to alcohol, wagering and profanity.

01:03:54.581 --> 01:03:57.500
-Now we're on a championship course
here. -[shaman chanting]

01:03:57.584 --> 01:04:01.129
So we are going
to be keeping this club pristine.

01:04:01.212 --> 01:04:05.675
So, Gabe, uh, why don't you and Bennett
play with Marcus and Ron today.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:06.926
Where's Ron anyway?

01:04:07.010 --> 01:04:08.011
Got your six, Captain.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:11.681
Ah, Lieutenant, good to see you.
Hope you're comfortable in a foursome.

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.725
As long as there's
at least one girl involved.

01:04:16.186 --> 01:04:18.563
All right, dick holes.
How much we betting?

01:04:18.646 --> 01:04:21.649
Hey, hey, man. Didn't you hear
what he said? No drinking and no
gambling.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:24.194
Marcus. Relax. Have some fun, all right?

01:04:24.277 --> 01:04:25.695
What do you say a hundred a hole?

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:26.780
Count me in.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:27.739
[Bennett] Me too.

01:04:27.822 --> 01:04:31.284
Tell you what. Let's keep it fresh.
Back nine we double the stakes.

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:32.786
-Double?
-Problem?

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:35.163
[chuckles] Please.
You see what I'm driving?

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:36.539
[Ron] That's you, the red one?

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:39.542
What is that? A Corvette, pre-owned?

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:42.212
-It's a Ferrari, you dipshit.
-$250,000.

01:04:42.295 --> 01:04:43.546
-Bought her brand-new.
-Boom.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:44.672
[imitates sizzle]

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:47.008
[Gabe] Now, Marcus,
I understand a hundred dollars a hole

01:04:47.092 --> 01:04:48.843
is a lot of green
for a blue-collar worker,

01:04:48.927 --> 01:04:50.595
so if you need to back out,
go ahead and do it now.

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:51.763
-Fuck you.
-Fuck you.

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:53.014
-No, fuck you.
-Fuck you again.

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:55.558
No, kiss my-- You know?
Let me holla at you real quick.

01:04:55.642 --> 01:04:56.768
Can you excuse us?

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.771
Man, I don't have that type of green.

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:02.232
Marcus, don't worry. I'll bankroll you.
Pay me back later.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:03.983
Bankroll me with what?

01:05:04.067 --> 01:05:05.068
How about this?

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:06.986
Where'd you get that?

01:05:07.070 --> 01:05:09.823
Who cares? Just help me whup
the Brooks Brothers over there. Come on.

01:05:09.906 --> 01:05:11.491
I would love to beat these two assholes…

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:12.992
-Do it.
-…but I suck at golf!

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:14.702
That's why you're lucky
I'm your best man.

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:17.705
["Space Ho's" playing]

01:05:23.044 --> 01:05:25.255
What was that?
Thought you said you was good?

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:26.965
I am. I just gotta get warmed up.

01:05:28.466 --> 01:05:29.801
You gotta get warmed up?

01:05:29.884 --> 01:05:31.553
-Want a hit?
-No!

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:33.638
[song continues]

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:39.018
Woo-hoo!

01:05:39.102 --> 01:05:41.563
[Gabe, Bennett] Ha! Ha!

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:47.652
Thank you so much. [chuckles]

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:54.075
[Emily's mother] Jesus,
I wish we had never hired this caterer.

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:55.952
Now he's telling me

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.538
that he's having trouble sourcing steaks
for tomorrow night.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:00.582
I'm so sorry,
but I do just have to go on record

01:06:00.665 --> 01:06:02.500
and say that I told you
to go with Ford Fry.

01:06:02.584 --> 01:06:04.335
-You did not listen to me…
-Brooke, please.

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:06.921
Okay. [stammers] Guys, please, for me.

01:06:07.005 --> 01:06:11.217
Mom, I am super positive
that the caterer will figure it all out.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:15.013
So for the next two hours,
can we just not think about steak?

01:06:15.096 --> 01:06:17.140
-Yes, dear.
-[whispering] Thank you.

01:06:17.223 --> 01:06:20.685
Wait, guys, steaks?
I know a place that has amazing steaks.

01:06:20.768 --> 01:06:23.771
Ron and I just went there on our way
here 'cause it's right down the block.

01:06:23.855 --> 01:06:27.525
Hal's in Buckhead?
They were asking $300 a plate.

01:06:27.609 --> 01:06:29.694
Oh, no. Girl, this place is under ten.

01:06:29.777 --> 01:06:31.321
Damn, that's a steal.

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:34.115
-What restaurant is this?
-Oh, it's called Waffle House.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:37.035
[all laughing]

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.664
Well, even I don't like Waffle House.

01:06:41.748 --> 01:06:43.708
Trust me, you guys. It's amazing.

01:06:43.791 --> 01:06:46.419
-Oh, my God. Is she serious?
-No, no, Mom. She's--

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:50.924
Whenever Ron and I are stressed or
horny or I have trouble going number
two--

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:52.592
Hey, Kyla. You know what?

01:06:52.675 --> 01:06:55.637
I think we're gonna just be here
in this moment,

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:58.681
enjoying the spa, relaxing. Yeah.

01:06:58.765 --> 01:07:02.435
Got you, Em. I swear I will stop talking,
and we should get our Zen on, right?

01:07:02.519 --> 01:07:04.229
'Cause that's why we're at the spa.

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:05.855
[sighs]

01:07:06.648 --> 01:07:10.068
Oh, Brooke, you remember when we had
our spa day right before your wedding?

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:12.403
Those hot stones were--

01:07:12.487 --> 01:07:13.738
[sobbing]

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:16.199
Oh, my God. Not again, please.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:18.535
-[Marcus's mother] Oh, no.
-[Kyla] What's the matter?

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:21.371
We're getting destroyed out there.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.790
-I thought you said you was good?
-I am good. You'll see.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.041
Ernesto!

01:07:27.085 --> 01:07:28.086
Sorry.

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:31.381
[Bennett sighs]

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:33.216
My man.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:35.426
Love that guy.

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:36.970
Did you just tip him $100?

01:07:37.554 --> 01:07:38.471
I have plenty left.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:40.181
Where did you get all that cash from?

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.017
I pawned the wedding rings.

01:07:43.601 --> 01:07:44.852
-No, you didn't.
-No, I did.

01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:47.146
-No, you didn't.
-No, I did.

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:49.399
-No, you didn't.
-I did. Totally. Here.

01:07:50.233 --> 01:07:53.111
Here's the receipt.
Northside Jewelry and Loans.

01:07:55.613 --> 01:07:56.948
[whispering] Oh, you did.

01:07:58.157 --> 01:08:01.035
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.495
I just got good with Harold.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.122
Pick 'em up when we win.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:05.623
Pick 'em up when we win?

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:08.459
[shouting] We're losing every hole!

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:12.338
-[birds chirping]
-[man] Come on, gentlemen. Man on the
tee.

01:08:12.839 --> 01:08:15.633
[sniffles] I'm so sorry.
I just can't breathe right now.

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.302
-[Emily's mother] Oh!
-[Kyla] Brooke.

01:08:17.385 --> 01:08:19.387
Sweetheart, it's okay. What's wrong?

01:08:19.470 --> 01:08:21.806
Back when we were dating,
Darren was so sweet.

01:08:21.889 --> 01:08:23.224
No, he wasn't.

01:08:23.308 --> 01:08:24.851
[Brooke] A little. He was a little sweet.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.270
Well, what did Darren do to you,
sweetheart?

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.897
He's super mean to me all the time.
He says mean things.

01:08:29.981 --> 01:08:31.608
Sweetie, what do you do about it?

01:08:31.691 --> 01:08:33.443
-Kyla.
-What? No, I'm serious.

01:08:33.526 --> 01:08:35.737
-What do you mean? I--
-Okay, guys. Here's the thing.

01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.324
I dated a lot of shitheads
before I met Ron, love of my life.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:41.993
They were just like Darren.
These are the kind of guys that are like--

01:08:42.076 --> 01:08:44.912
They think they're the alpha,
but deep down,

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.540
-they know they're just a little bitch.
-Okay, Kyla…

01:08:47.624 --> 01:08:51.044
Next time Darren steps out of line,
you pop him in the balls.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.086
Who are you?

01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:53.504
-You can do it very nicely.
-This person is insane.

01:08:53.588 --> 01:08:56.174
I have a couple restraining orders.
It's not that big of a deal.

01:08:56.257 --> 01:08:59.260
-[muttering]
-This is a criminal. This is a criminal.

01:08:59.344 --> 01:09:01.846
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Yeah. Let's go chat.

01:09:01.929 --> 01:09:04.891
Are you sure you wanna leave them?
Because we have our massages in two
minutes,

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:07.352
-and we're getting so much free shit--
-What are you doing?

01:09:07.435 --> 01:09:12.231
What? I was just trying to be helpful
and give your sister some advice.

01:09:12.315 --> 01:09:14.984
By suggesting that she pop her husband
in the balls?

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:16.194
Yes.

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.030
-Oh, my God. Please.
-What?

01:09:19.113 --> 01:09:23.993
Kyla,
this weekend is already so stressful.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:27.288
All I'm asking is that you not add
to that stress.

01:09:27.914 --> 01:09:29.415
Can you please do that for me?

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.459
[whispering] Okay.

01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:33.294
Why are you whispering?

01:09:33.378 --> 01:09:35.880
Well, because you thought
I was too loud in there.

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:39.217
[sighs] God.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:40.677
[Gabe, Ron] Two, three, four.

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:43.096
-[groans]
-[groans, chuckles]

01:09:43.179 --> 01:09:45.264
-That's what I'm talking about.
-Put some respect on it.

01:09:45.348 --> 01:09:46.849
Watch out.

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.976
-[Marcus] Okay. How much you got left?
-Not a lot.

01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:51.729
-We're gonna never get those rings back.
-[Ron] All right, boys. Last hole.

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:52.855
Let's do something big.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.692
Double or nothing. All in. I stick it
on the green from here in one shot.

01:09:55.775 --> 01:09:58.319
Double or nothing? That's what you-- No!

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.071
No. No double or nothing. No!

01:10:00.154 --> 01:10:02.198
You do realize
you haven't hit a green all day, right?

01:10:02.281 --> 01:10:04.158
Wait. Haven't I?

01:10:04.242 --> 01:10:07.578
You know what? We're in. Actually,
let's make it a little interesting.

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:09.622
Let's put Bennett's Ferrari in the pot.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.791
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on.

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:12.959
That's like 45 grand.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.335
Forty-five thousand?

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:17.505
It's pre-owned.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:19.215
We can match that.

01:10:20.508 --> 01:10:25.012
One shot. I stick it on the 18th green
from here, we win.

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:28.558
I miss by an inch, we lose.

01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:32.186
Ron. Ron. I can't do that.

01:10:32.270 --> 01:10:34.689
Come on. You can, man.
Remember, just float.

01:10:34.772 --> 01:10:36.816
What the fuck you mean floating?
Fuck floating.

01:10:36.899 --> 01:10:37.900
[Bennett] Fine.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:39.694
-It's a bet.
-Fine.

01:10:42.071 --> 01:10:43.030
All right, gentlemen.

01:10:43.114 --> 01:10:46.367
For the record, this is a Titleist 7
with two pink dots. Do we agree?

01:10:46.451 --> 01:10:49.579
Yes. We do agree that
you are a dumbass.

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:51.205
That is the wrong hole.

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:52.498
That's the seventh green.

01:10:52.582 --> 01:10:56.461
The 18th green… that way.

01:11:05.928 --> 01:11:08.681
Three hundred and seventy-five yards.
Dogleg left.

01:11:08.765 --> 01:11:10.391
Good luck hitting over the trees.

01:11:10.475 --> 01:11:11.851
[Bennett] And no backing out.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:13.519
We shook on it.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.104
-Mm-hmm.
-[Bennett giggling]

01:11:15.688 --> 01:11:16.522
Aw.

01:11:16.606 --> 01:11:17.607
[Bennett chuckles]

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.947
I can't watch this.

01:11:29.243 --> 01:11:30.244
[sighs]

01:11:53.226 --> 01:11:54.560
[together] Whoa.

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.730
-[shaman chanting]
-[sighs]

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:06.739
-[Bennett] You see it?
-[Gabe] No.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:08.324
-Do you see-- No. No, no.
-[cart approaching]

01:12:08.407 --> 01:12:09.575
It's not on the green.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:13.996
It's not on the green.
Oh. It's not on the green.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.957
Could've sworn I got all of it.

01:12:17.208 --> 01:12:18.501
Check the cup.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:20.586
-Check the cup? [chuckles]
-Check these nuts.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:27.301
[shaman chanting]

01:12:29.679 --> 01:12:30.680
"Titleist 7."

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:33.099
Two pink dots.

01:12:33.683 --> 01:12:34.976
What?

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:36.644
-[Ron, Marcus laughing]
-[alarm chirps]

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:37.562
[Ron] Yes.

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:40.773
[Marcus] You was hustling them the
whole time? Where you learn to play like
that?

01:12:40.857 --> 01:12:44.902
[Ron] Army shrink. He said golf was good
for PTSD. I got a little obsessed.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:47.029
But that was a hole in one.
What are the chances?

01:12:47.113 --> 01:12:48.447
[chuckling] Uh, roughly zero.

01:12:48.531 --> 01:12:50.992
-So, you cheated?
-I do not cheat.

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:52.618
I put that on the green fair and square.

01:12:52.702 --> 01:12:55.288
Ernesto. Remember my guy?

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:58.040
I had him kick it in the cup to make
it awesome, which it totally was.

01:12:58.124 --> 01:13:00.585
Well, look at you now, brother.
You own a new Ferrari.

01:13:00.668 --> 01:13:03.421
Nah, man. We'll enjoy this for a bit,
but I'm-- I'm giving it back.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:05.840
I only did it for one reason, Marcus.

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:11.137
No one, and I mean no one, talks to you
the way they did at breakfast.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:14.307
Thank you. And I appreciate that.
So, we can-- Can we just go get the
ring--

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:17.727
You made me your best man, and with
that comes a solemn oath of
responsibility.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:21.230
Cool. And you're right. It comes with--

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:23.399
Responsibility to always have your back.

01:13:24.358 --> 01:13:30.239
I give you my word.
I will never, ever… ever let you down.

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:31.490
Ron, I get it.

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:35.578
I get it. You got my back. But can we now
go get the rings? Like-- Like right now.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:37.079
Sure, man. What's the rush?

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:39.749
Pawnshop closes at 6:00. It's like 2:45.

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:41.500
What are you talking about? It's 5:45.

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:43.127
Oh, shit. [chuckles]

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:45.546
My watch is still on Oregon time.
I never changed it.

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:48.966
I was wondering why it gets dark
out here so early.

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:51.552
What?

01:13:51.636 --> 01:13:53.512
[birds chirping]

01:13:53.596 --> 01:13:58.643
[reporter on radio] <i>…arrested for breaking</i>
<i>into a Pine Valley lake house.</i>

01:13:58.726 --> 01:14:01.729
<i>Luckily for him,</i>

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:05.399

-[man 1] Whoa!
-[man 2] Whoa!

01:14:17.995 --> 01:14:19.497
[tires screeching]

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.208
-[man 1] Hell, man!
-[man 2] Whoa!

01:14:24.043 --> 01:14:25.044
Wait.

[cawing]

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:32.635
[sighs] Thank fucking God!

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:35.388
-[sighs]
-[Ron] See, man? Just like I told you.

01:14:35.471 --> 01:14:38.683
You just gotta float and, somehow,
it all works out. You feel better?

01:14:39.517 --> 01:14:42.144
-Did you ask me if I feel better?
-Yeah.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:43.229
Are you serious?

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:46.190
Do I feel better?
You know how close that was?

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:49.360
If I had lost these rings,
that whole family would've been on my
ass!

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:53.114
[ominous music playing]

01:14:59.870 --> 01:15:00.788
[gasps]

01:15:02.123 --> 01:15:04.041
What if somebody came in
and bought these rings?

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:05.835
We wouldn't have been able
to get back the rings.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:09.422
We'd have to get some rings from some
dead person's fingers that I don't even
know.

01:15:23.436 --> 01:15:26.188
[cawing]

01:15:26.272 --> 01:15:28.649
What should I feel better about?
You know what I'll feel better about?

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:30.818
When we get back
to that stuffy ass country club

01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:35.489
and get these goddamn Conway family
rings on our goddamn fingers.

01:15:37.783 --> 01:15:39.160
[cawing continues]

01:15:39.243 --> 01:15:43.205
[distorted] That bird's about to shit.

01:15:43.873 --> 01:15:45.541
That's what would happen If I lost these--

01:15:50.421 --> 01:15:52.381
[water splashing]

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:02.600
I didn't-- I didn't want you
to get your shoes messy.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:08.439
[chuckling]

01:16:09.273 --> 01:16:11.317
You didn't want to get my shoes messy?

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:12.985
I figured you could hold on to them.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:16.697
I didn't know you were gonna drop 'em.
I just was trying to save your sh--

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:20.826
You were trying to save
my shoes. [laughs]

01:16:20.910 --> 01:16:24.955
You don't care about my wedding or
me being happy for the rest of my life--

01:16:25.039 --> 01:16:26.957
I just didn't know what
was gonna happen.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.167
Ah! Motherfucker!

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:31.337
Hey. Okay.
You're choking me, man. You're--

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.630
-[grunts]
-[panting]

01:16:32.713 --> 01:16:34.006
You're choking me.

01:16:34.090 --> 01:16:35.549
I know exactly what I'm doing.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:37.343
Marcus, I'm trained to escape this.

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:41.180
But I won't. You're my friend. [coughs]

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.265
I think you need
to express your feelings here.

01:16:43.349 --> 01:16:45.142
Feelings? I feel great.

01:16:45.226 --> 01:16:48.187
I feel so good. This the best
I've felt all fucking weekend.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.815
[choking] Got it. Before you choke me
out, there's something you should know.

01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:51.982
Shut up!

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:54.944
Back before Mexico, the doctors said
I could never have a baby. [coughs]

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:57.822
They said I was sterile. [coughs]

01:16:57.905 --> 01:16:58.989
Wait, wait. What?

01:16:59.073 --> 01:17:00.991
I went to see a bunch of specialists.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:04.745
Out-of-pocket cost is so damn high
with the deductibles. I should have--

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:06.497
Get to the fucking point!

01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.583
Back in Mexico, Kyla got pregnant.
[coughs]

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:10.876
And…

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:14.922
it's because… [coughs] …of you.

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:18.843
-Oh, God.
-Okay. Passing out.

01:17:19.593 --> 01:17:22.346
[coughing, wheezing]

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.640
Aw, man. Never mind, I'm good.

01:17:24.723 --> 01:17:25.808
[body thuds]

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:28.477
[whispering] What?

01:17:29.228 --> 01:17:30.521
[panting]

01:17:30.604 --> 01:17:31.939
No, no, no, no, no, no.

01:17:34.275 --> 01:17:37.319
-[jazz music playing on speakers]
-[chattering]

01:17:39.488 --> 01:17:40.656
[sighs]

01:17:44.702 --> 01:17:46.579
-[chuckling] Hey, everybody.
-[Emily scoffs]

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.539
We-- We need to talk.

01:17:48.622 --> 01:17:51.542
Where have you been?
My brother got back from golf an hour
ago.

01:17:51.625 --> 01:17:54.503
I really need to talk to you
about something, like, right now.

01:17:55.087 --> 01:17:56.130
-Right now?
-Yes.

01:17:56.213 --> 01:18:00.634
So, Kyla's not five months pregnant.
She got pregnant in Mexico.

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:01.719
So?

01:18:02.553 --> 01:18:03.554
So…

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:06.348
um… [chuckles]

01:18:06.432 --> 01:18:09.226
…you know that night got a little--
got a little crazy,

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:12.813
and we never-- we never actually
discussed everything that happened.

01:18:12.897 --> 01:18:14.190
Like what?

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:18.944
Like, you know, we had sex
in the same room. Me and you.

01:18:19.820 --> 01:18:25.701
But also, it was, like, partners
in the room also having sex.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:29.997
But not with their particular partners.

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:35.294
You understand where
I'm going with this?

01:18:35.377 --> 01:18:37.254
[sighs]

01:18:37.338 --> 01:18:40.299
Yes. I… I know.

01:18:41.759 --> 01:18:42.760
You do?

01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:47.264
I know exactly what happened.
I was there, Marcus.

01:18:47.848 --> 01:18:49.016
[door opens]

01:18:49.099 --> 01:18:51.560
[chattering]

01:18:51.644 --> 01:18:53.229
Uh…

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:54.313
Baby, is that Zeke?

01:18:57.107 --> 01:18:59.318
And Enzo and Fred.

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:01.987
Who the hell are these people?

01:19:02.071 --> 01:19:03.113
Surprise!

01:19:03.197 --> 01:19:04.198
-Hey.
-Hey.

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:06.700
What the hell you doing here?
Matter of fact, why you not at work?

01:19:06.784 --> 01:19:09.453
Nice place, boss. Yeah, I would not
have let us come to this either.

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:11.413
But we do appreciate the invitation.

01:19:11.497 --> 01:19:13.624
What you mean "invitation"?
I didn't invite you. Who--

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.668
Who did invite you?

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.294
[Ron] Uh, ladies and gentlemen…

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:19.004
Good evening everyone, and welcome.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:20.923
-[giggles]
-[shaman chanting]

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.424
What is he doing up there?

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:25.469
Captain, uh, permission to say a few
words about the happy couple?

01:19:25.552 --> 01:19:26.595
[chuckles]

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:29.556
Hello, everyone.
I'm Ron. I'm Marcus's <i>suku'un</i>.

01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.434
Of course, you wouldn't know that if you
saw him choking me in the street earlier.

01:19:32.518 --> 01:19:34.103
-The fuck is he talking 'bout?
-Shh.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:37.106
Marcus. Bet you're surprised
to see your pals from work, huh?

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:39.692
When I heard Kyla and I were
your only close friends here,

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:41.610
I called Parker Construction myself,

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:45.155
and I told them,
"You better get your butts on a plane!"

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:46.323
'Cause let's face it,

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:49.660
it's times like these when you want
your closest friends by your side.

01:19:49.743 --> 01:19:52.246
I was best man for my army pal,
Charlie Anderton.

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.998
Man, Charlie and I are super close.

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:56.834
Like, I talk to him every day.

01:19:57.418 --> 01:20:00.254
Never in my life did I think
I'd have another friend like Charlie.

01:20:02.006 --> 01:20:05.092
And then Marcus and I crossed paths
in Mexico, and I know. I know.

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:06.969
I'm not supposed to talk about Mexico.

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:08.262
[chuckles]

01:20:08.345 --> 01:20:12.391
It was just that moment where
Emily and Marcus became like family

01:20:12.474 --> 01:20:13.976
to Kyla and me.

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:17.813
But little did we know just how much
like family we would become.

01:20:19.273 --> 01:20:21.025
-Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Kyla.
-[chuckles]

01:20:21.108 --> 01:20:24.486
Thank you, baby.
Isn't he so cute, you guys?

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:29.033
Don't you wanna bake him at 350
till his skin gets crispy?

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:30.117
[giggles] I do.

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:32.411
Um, as you can see,
I'm currently with child,

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:35.956
which is, like, actually insane
because Ron and I were told that kids,

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:38.042
like, weren't gonna be
in the cards for us.

01:20:38.125 --> 01:20:41.503
Without going into too much detail,
it was a semen issue.

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:44.340
You know what I mean?
So for us, he could shoot far.

01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:45.841
Not like my friend Sue's husband

01:20:45.924 --> 01:20:48.218
who it kinda trickles off the top
of the dick like a waterfall.

01:20:48.302 --> 01:20:50.387
No, when he shoots, he shoots fast.

01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:52.806
He shoots hard.
He shoots, like, a straight shot.

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:57.102
So it's more kind of like what's in
the shots that's the problem. [chuckles]

01:20:57.186 --> 01:21:00.356
Anyway, Larry and Nancy, rest assured.

01:21:00.439 --> 01:21:04.151
Because even if these two choose
to not have kids of their own,

01:21:04.234 --> 01:21:06.236
your legacy is alive and well

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:10.741
and kicking right here inside of me
in my fertile womb.

01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:13.619
-This is what I was trying to tell you.
-What are you talking about?

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:17.706
But something super magical happened
when we were in Mexico.

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:22.419
And, Marcus, you are destined to play a
really important part in our child's life.

01:21:23.045 --> 01:21:27.716
I am so excited to announce
to all of you that this baby is--

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:28.926
Is mine!

01:21:29.009 --> 01:21:30.803
-It's mine.
-[guests gasping, murmuring]

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:36.767
The baby she's carrying…
It's my-- It's my baby.

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:40.145
[whispering] I'm confused.

01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:43.857
I was taught by them to step up
and do what's right, and I'm doing it.

01:21:43.941 --> 01:21:45.317
Pass me the wine.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:48.987
Me and Emily took a trip to Mexico
where we met these two.

01:21:49.071 --> 01:21:53.409
And, uh, one night, we got really drunk.

01:21:53.492 --> 01:21:58.664
Like, like insanely drunk,
like really fucked up.

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:04.294
I was toe up, and things got
a little, um… a little weird.

01:22:06.171 --> 01:22:09.925
Sexually. It got sexually weird.

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:15.514
Which led to me unintentionally,
'cause it wasn't my intentions to do this,

01:22:15.597 --> 01:22:18.725
I unintentionally gave this woman a baby.

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.186
So now she's carrying my child.

01:22:21.854 --> 01:22:24.648
It is what it is. That's my baby.

01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.527
Actually, no.

01:22:30.737 --> 01:22:35.075
We just wanted to share with you
that it's a boy,

01:22:36.076 --> 01:22:38.704
and we're gonna name him Marcus
in your honor.

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:43.292
You're not the father.
He's not the father. I am. [chuckles]

01:22:44.543 --> 01:22:46.336
I've been trying
to tell you that all week.

01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.716
Okay, in Mexico, remember? I was gonna
run and jump off the cliff into the water.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:53.302
-You're like, "Don't cover your balls."
-Yeah. So?

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:55.804
Yeah, so, the impact from the jump, like,

01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:58.599
knocked the eight ball back
in the corner pocket.

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:01.435
'Cause now-- now my balls work, man.

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.438
My balls work because of you.

01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:09.276
So, that's not my baby?

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:11.069
-No.
-No.

01:23:11.153 --> 01:23:13.447
[whispering] Yeah. It's not.

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:14.531
Sorry.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:23.165
[Marcus clears throat, smacks lips]

01:23:24.124 --> 01:23:29.671
I believe that the food choices are
between the fish

01:23:30.672 --> 01:23:32.508
and-- and the beef.

01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:35.093
-Yeah.
-I hear they're both really tasty.

01:23:35.969 --> 01:23:38.805
-Did you cheat on my daughter?
-Captain, hold on.

01:23:38.889 --> 01:23:41.433
Answer me.
Did you have sex with that woman?

01:23:41.517 --> 01:23:43.560
I'm honestly very confused right now.

01:23:43.644 --> 01:23:45.729
-No, Daddy, he didn't.
-How would you know?

01:23:46.730 --> 01:23:47.814
I just do, okay?

01:23:47.898 --> 01:23:49.483
No! How would you know?

01:23:49.566 --> 01:23:51.401
-Because I did.
-[guests gasp]

01:23:51.485 --> 01:23:54.780
It's true. She did. It was hot.

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:57.282
I can vouch. [chuckles] Super hot.

01:23:57.366 --> 01:23:59.701
This is the best wedding
I've ever been to.

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:01.453
Seriously?

01:24:01.537 --> 01:24:04.498
You-- You will never marry my daughter.

01:24:04.581 --> 01:24:06.041
What have you done to her?

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:08.252
-He didn't do anything to me, Dad.
-[Gabe] Enough!

01:24:08.335 --> 01:24:09.545
Move.

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:11.296
Sis, you're not thinking straight, okay?

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.340
Look, it's obvious to
everyone besides you

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:15.759
that you're marrying some loser
who's only bringing you down.

01:24:15.842 --> 01:24:17.094
Yo, who you talkin' about?

01:24:17.177 --> 01:24:18.720
I am talking about you.

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:21.598
You're utterly beneath her.
You have trash friends, a trash job.

01:24:21.682 --> 01:24:23.600
And you wanna know
why? Because you are--

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:25.060
-What?
-[screams]

01:24:25.811 --> 01:24:26.645
Shit.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:28.397
-Well.
-[chuckling] Okay.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:30.357
[man yodeling]

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.776
Look what you made me do again.

01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:34.820
Marcus. You give me back those rings.

01:24:34.903 --> 01:24:36.905
-Just give me back those damn rings.
-Oh, my--

01:24:36.989 --> 01:24:39.157
Guess what, Harold.
It's not gonna happen.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.993
You know why? Because the rings…

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:44.413
the rings are in the, um…

01:24:45.539 --> 01:24:46.790
in the sewer.

01:24:46.873 --> 01:24:48.333
[Emily's mother gasps]

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:50.085
[guests murmuring]

01:24:50.168 --> 01:24:51.169
My rings?

01:24:51.253 --> 01:24:53.088
Marcus. [sighs] Marcus.

01:24:54.381 --> 01:24:57.342
-Is this who you want to marry?
-Not right now, Mom.

01:24:57.426 --> 01:24:58.719
I'm gonna kick your ass, man.

01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:00.929
Slow down, playboy.
Nobody's kicking anybody's ass.

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:02.180
[grunts]

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:03.765
-Yo.
-[grunts]

01:25:03.849 --> 01:25:05.142
[clamoring]

01:25:05.225 --> 01:25:07.603
[Kyla] Ron! Oh, my God! You guys!

01:25:12.649 --> 01:25:16.278
[Kyla] Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit!

01:25:16.361 --> 01:25:18.488
Shit. Shit. Shit.

01:25:18.572 --> 01:25:20.240
[grunts] So sorry.

01:25:25.912 --> 01:25:27.581
[grunts] Sorry.

01:25:28.165 --> 01:25:30.584
-You think the bar's still open?
-Mmm.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:36.715
Marcus. Marcus, wait. Wait, baby.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:39.217
Baby, why didn't you just tell me
you slept with Kyla?

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:42.596
[sighs] I don't know, okay.
Everything was just so weird.

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:44.473
And like you said, we were all so drunk.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:48.018
It's no excuse, but it's not like you were
rushing to tell me you slept with her too.

01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:50.103
-But I didn't sleep with her.
-But you thought you did.

01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:52.898
-Yeah, 'cause she was on top of me.
-No. We were on top of you.

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.274
You were not involved.

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:55.776
-[Kyla] Almost.
-What are we doing?

01:25:55.859 --> 01:25:58.445
[Kyla] You okay?
That was scary, right? Now…

01:25:58.528 --> 01:25:59.446
What the hell?

01:26:00.447 --> 01:26:03.200
Three, two times a day.
Down the hatch. Now swallow it down.

01:26:03.283 --> 01:26:05.369
-Get it down.
-Hey. Look. What are you doing?

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:06.912
-What?
-What?

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:11.333
I knew it. Dr. Adolphus. You've been
giving her pills this whole time?

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:13.460
She's in so much pain.
I'm just helping her manage it.

01:26:13.543 --> 01:26:14.836
-[Emily] Oh, my God.
-What the fuck, Kyla?

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.464
-What?
-She's old. She could OD.

01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:19.758
-Grandma, spit it out.
-Hey, guys.

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.927
-[coughing]
-Grandma, Grandma. Spit it out.
Grandma.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:23.387
Spit it out, Grandma! Grandma.

01:26:23.470 --> 01:26:24.638
I feel like I missed something.

01:26:24.721 --> 01:26:26.181
You know what? Just try and swallow--

01:26:26.264 --> 01:26:28.892
Come here!
You had no right to give her drugs.

01:26:28.975 --> 01:26:32.312
Oh, no, no. No, no, no, babe.
They're not drugs. They're herbs.

01:26:32.396 --> 01:26:34.690
Dr. Adolphus--
No, he's a homeopathic doctor.

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:37.109
Bullshit.
You said he got in trouble with the law.

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:38.735
Yeah, for selling raw milk.

01:26:38.819 --> 01:26:40.737
Oregon's just not as liberal
as people think.

01:26:40.821 --> 01:26:42.864
Whatever. The fact is, that's my grandma.

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:44.491
You should not have been
giving her anything.

01:26:44.574 --> 01:26:46.076
[Marcus] That's the
problem with you two.

01:26:46.159 --> 01:26:48.245
Y'all love poking your noses
in other people's shit.

01:26:48.328 --> 01:26:49.454
Marcus, that's not true.

01:26:49.538 --> 01:26:50.664
Oh, it's not true?

01:26:50.747 --> 01:26:55.085
So, why would you invite my coworkers
to a wedding without asking me?

01:26:55.168 --> 01:26:57.879
Why did you pawn my rings? You didn't
ask me if we wanted to do that either.

01:26:57.963 --> 01:27:02.426
Or why would you put cocaine in the
drinks of people you don't even know?

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:06.471
Because I would want people to put
cocaine in my drink if they just met me.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:08.181
We were just trying to be nice.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:11.143
"Trying to be nice"
just blew up my fucking wedding!

01:27:11.226 --> 01:27:12.144
[Marcus] This the crazy part.

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:14.646
We have no idea why you're here
'cause we didn't even invite you.

01:27:14.730 --> 01:27:16.481
Marcus, we're here
because we're your friends.

01:27:16.565 --> 01:27:19.151
Friends? You think we're friends?

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:20.986
We're not friends, okay!

01:27:21.069 --> 01:27:25.198
We were just vacation friends
for one week in Mexico!

01:27:25.282 --> 01:27:27.284
We didn't plan on
seeing y'all again, at all!

01:27:27.367 --> 01:27:29.536
That's why I didn't give you
my phone number!

01:27:31.538 --> 01:27:33.749
Okay, look. It's been an emotional night--

01:27:33.832 --> 01:27:35.250
Emotional? Let me say this to you.

01:27:35.333 --> 01:27:38.462
Your friend Charlie probably was able
to put up with your bullshit,

01:27:38.545 --> 01:27:41.298
but I'm gonna tell you something,
we had enough.

01:27:41.381 --> 01:27:42.382
We're done.

01:27:42.466 --> 01:27:44.843
So do us a favor
and float the fuck outta here.

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:52.058
Kyla.

01:28:06.072 --> 01:28:07.783
Uh, baby, it had to be done.

01:28:08.867 --> 01:28:10.952
Yeah. They-- They had it--
They had it coming.

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:13.747
-Yeah.
-Right?

01:28:14.748 --> 01:28:16.041
Yeah.

01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:17.834
Grandma, let me get you back inside.

01:28:21.963 --> 01:28:23.965
[birds chirping]

01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.513
[sighs] Oh, Emily says
Harold is still missing.

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:31.473
He was gone the whole night?

01:28:31.556 --> 01:28:34.559
-You think your employees whupped his
ass? -[Nancy] Oh, stop.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:37.062
Dad, no, okay. My employees wouldn't…

01:28:40.273 --> 01:28:42.609
-Nah, you-- you're being ridiculous.
-[door opens]

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:43.735
[laughing]

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:46.029
There he is. The man of the hour.

01:28:46.112 --> 01:28:47.614
Are y'all drinking already?

01:28:47.697 --> 01:28:49.032
We still going from last night.

01:28:49.115 --> 01:28:51.076
Yeah, man.
Your wedding just gets better and better.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:52.911
Well, I'm glad you enjoying yourself,

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:56.164
but, honestly, I don't think
we gonna have a wedding anymore.

01:28:56.248 --> 01:28:58.083
-Do we get the Hennessy back?
-Mmm.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.001
What are you talking about?
It's happening.

01:29:00.085 --> 01:29:01.336
-Says who?
-[door opens]

01:29:02.587 --> 01:29:04.089
Says this asshole.

01:29:04.172 --> 01:29:06.591
[all laughing]

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:07.676
[Marcus] Harold?

01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:10.846
How are ya? Marcus. How you doing?

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:12.931
Okay, look, man. Where have you been?

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.934
-[chuckles]
-Well, I've been with these fools.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:17.894
It's an old army tradition.

01:29:17.978 --> 01:29:21.064
When you punch a man,
you have to buy him a beer.

01:29:21.147 --> 01:29:22.190
And we started drinking.

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:25.277
[together] And drinking
and drinking and drinking.

01:29:26.236 --> 01:29:30.198
And while we were drinking, the boys told
me about what it was like to work for
you.

01:29:31.324 --> 01:29:35.829
They said, "Oh, Marcus.
Marcus is so-- so demanding,

01:29:35.912 --> 01:29:38.790
so-- so uncompromising."

01:29:38.874 --> 01:29:42.794
I must admit,
it does sound like someone I know.

01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:44.004
[chuckles]

01:29:44.087 --> 01:29:49.551
Then they told me
why your last marriage ended.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:51.386
Is that right?

01:29:51.970 --> 01:29:55.891
They said, your wife, she didn't wanna
go along with the sacrifices

01:29:55.974 --> 01:29:58.059
that you made when the recession hit.

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:01.646
And they told me that…

01:30:02.898 --> 01:30:04.316
[sighs]

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:09.654
…that you paid for
all of your employees, every man,

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:11.990
out of your own pocket.

01:30:12.949 --> 01:30:14.451
Came back strong, though.

01:30:14.534 --> 01:30:16.286
Thirty-five mil in revenue last year.

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:18.371
It's right there on the spreadsheet.

01:30:18.455 --> 01:30:23.335
I admit, I haven't held you
in the highest esteem.

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.379
But you're a good businessman, Marcus.

01:30:27.047 --> 01:30:31.676
But more important, you are a good man.

01:30:33.553 --> 01:30:36.848
[chuckles] Wow. This means a lot, Harold.
I really appreciate--

01:30:36.932 --> 01:30:39.559
[all laughing]

01:30:40.268 --> 01:30:44.230
Yes. And to think,
I would never known any of this

01:30:44.314 --> 01:30:46.775
if you hadn't invited these boys.

01:30:47.359 --> 01:30:50.195
But, no. I mean, I actually
didn't even invite them. [chuckles]

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:52.781
Ron did.

01:30:53.490 --> 01:30:54.491
Huh.

01:30:55.784 --> 01:30:57.118
Where is Ron?

01:30:58.119 --> 01:31:01.039
Hi, sweetie. Got a minute?

01:31:01.122 --> 01:31:05.043
Grandma. I'm sorry about last night.
[sighs]

01:31:05.126 --> 01:31:08.463
You mean when you stuck your hand
down my throat. [chuckles]

01:31:08.546 --> 01:31:10.799
-It happens.
-Does it?

01:31:10.882 --> 01:31:12.467
Whoa, whoa.

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:13.718
You can walk.

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:17.097
That pill Kyla gave me really works.

01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:18.848
-Seriously? The herbs?
-Yeah.

01:31:18.932 --> 01:31:22.018
And it doesn't make me sleepy
like my usual pill.

01:31:22.936 --> 01:31:25.480
Oh, she's a sweet girl.

01:31:25.563 --> 01:31:27.148
Yeah, she…

01:31:28.942 --> 01:31:30.402
She's something. [sighs]

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.946
I'm sorry you two had a falling out.

01:31:33.947 --> 01:31:36.366
But she did leave a wedding gift for you.

01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:47.460
"Emily, you're the sister I never had
because my real sister is a B-I-T-C-H.

01:31:47.544 --> 01:31:51.131
I guess it doesn't work to spell out
bad words when you're writing.

01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:52.549
And meeting Marcus…"

01:31:54.926 --> 01:31:57.595
"And meeting Marcus
has brought Ron back to life.

01:31:58.847 --> 01:31:59.848
You wouldn't know it,

01:31:59.931 --> 01:32:03.727
but he's been in a shit ton of pain
since he lost his best friend, Charlie.

01:32:04.894 --> 01:32:07.772
When Charlie died,
half of Ron died with him.

01:32:08.606 --> 01:32:10.859
Or at least it did
until you guys came along.

01:32:10.942 --> 01:32:13.611
I'm sorry we cocked up
your whole weekend.

01:32:13.695 --> 01:32:17.157
To make up for it,
Ron spent all morning getting these back.

01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:20.910
PS: I'd wash them
before you put them on."

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:29.669
[sighs, scoffs]

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:31.921
We messed up, Marcus.

01:32:32.005 --> 01:32:33.465
Yeah.

01:32:33.548 --> 01:32:34.591
We gotta find them.

01:32:34.674 --> 01:32:37.761
I don't know how we gonna do that.
Look, we ain't got a phone number on
'em.

01:32:37.844 --> 01:32:40.430
-Shit, I don't even know where they
went. -[sighs]

01:32:46.895 --> 01:32:49.481
[Emily] It should be close.
She said it was right down the block.

01:32:50.148 --> 01:32:52.650
Nope. [panting]
Damn, baby, you know there's a--

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:54.903
there's a hundred Waffle Houses
in Atlanta.

01:32:54.986 --> 01:32:58.948
So then we'll just work our way up
from here in concentric circles.

01:32:59.032 --> 01:33:01.117
Classic circle sweep maneuver.

I'm so glad we found you guys.

01:33:32.982 --> 01:33:36.277
Mmm. Well, isn't this
an unhappy coincidence, huh, babe?

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:38.822
There's a Waffle House
right across the street.

01:33:40.073 --> 01:33:41.908
-You should go eat at that one.
-[Marcus] Look, guys.

01:33:41.991 --> 01:33:44.119
I know we said
some pretty shitty stuff last night.

01:33:44.202 --> 01:33:47.330
-Yeah, shitty, untrue stuff.
-And you right, and we were out of line.

01:33:47.413 --> 01:33:49.457
Yeah.
You guys are not just vacation friends.

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:51.960
You're real friends,
and we should have treated you like that.

01:33:52.043 --> 01:33:54.170
So, please come--
come back to the wedding.

01:33:55.171 --> 01:33:57.006
I can't get married without my best man.

01:33:57.090 --> 01:33:59.843

we know you mean 'em?

-Fuck that.
-Kyla.

01:34:20.864 --> 01:34:22.323
[Kyla] Ron, you heard them.

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:25.243
They were, like, accusing me
of giving drugs to people.

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:28.288
-You-- You did.
-Only the good kind.

01:34:28.371 --> 01:34:30.123
Right. They were homeopathic.

01:34:30.206 --> 01:34:32.333
No, I'm talking about the cocaine.

01:34:33.126 --> 01:34:35.545
It was really, really good cocaine.

01:34:37.589 --> 01:34:38.590
No, honey.

01:34:39.966 --> 01:34:40.967
It was great cocaine.

01:34:41.593 --> 01:34:43.386
[crying] Thank you. I love you.

01:34:44.512 --> 01:34:46.431

all the way down here.

01:34:51.477 --> 01:34:52.854
That's huge.

01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:56.983
Okay. We will come to your wedding,

01:34:57.066 --> 01:34:58.818
but you have to promise
to do something for me.

01:34:59.569 --> 01:35:00.862
Sure. What-- What is it?

01:35:00.945 --> 01:35:06.117

that you will come to ours.

Well, Ron and I wanna do
what's best for Marcus.

Why do y'all wanna do
what's best for me?

No, Marcus… Marcus.

we're literally naming after you.

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.905
We love you so much.
Congratulations to Ron and Kyla!

01:36:25.989 --> 01:36:27.490
[cheering]

01:36:27.573 --> 01:36:28.574
Cheers!

01:36:28.658 --> 01:36:30.285
Mmm.

01:36:30.368 --> 01:36:31.369
Refreshing.

01:36:32.120 --> 01:36:34.289

The salt doesn't taste very salty.

01:36:34.372 --> 01:36:35.873
-[Kyla] Hi, guys!
-Oh!

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:37.041
-Take this. Take this.
-[laughs]

01:36:37.125 --> 01:36:38.960
-Do you mind taking baby Marcus?
-Oh, please.

01:36:42.088 --> 01:36:44.257
[sighs] Wow.

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:47.552
Okay. I'll do it if you do it.

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:50.847
Jesus, Emily. I'm a mom now.

01:36:52.348 --> 01:36:53.683
Of course I'm gonna do it.

01:36:53.766 --> 01:36:54.767
[chuckles]

01:36:54.851 --> 01:36:58.730
Hard to believe I'm a married man now.
It's a lot of responsibility.

01:36:58.813 --> 01:37:00.481
Think you're ready for it?

01:37:02.358 --> 01:37:03.359
Yeah.

01:37:03.901 --> 01:37:04.902
Any advice?

01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:10.533
A wise man told me
once to… to just float.

01:37:10.616 --> 01:37:12.452
[Ron, Marcus chuckle]

01:37:12.535 --> 01:37:13.619
-All right.
-Whoa, wait!

01:37:13.703 --> 01:37:15.705
