00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:26.703
Listen!

00:00:26.727 --> 00:00:27.728
Stop!

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:29.506
You silly fucking twit!

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.531
Please!

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:34.477
You are one stupid
fucking bitch, you know that?

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.647
Shut the fuck up!

00:00:36.737 --> 00:00:38.410
No.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:44.188
There you are.

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:47.153
No!

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:49.749
No.

00:00:49.816 --> 00:00:51.762
You're a little shit.
No!

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.186
No!

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:47.809
Anastasia Steele?

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:52.984
Thanks.

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:52.844
Yeah. Got it.
Thank you.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.510
Good morning, Mr. Hyde.

00:02:54.608 --> 00:02:56.781
Ana, please, it's Jack.

00:02:57.277 --> 00:02:59.223
Tea, right? Weak, black.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:02.225
I'm pretty sure I'm
supposed to get this for you,

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:04.362
but thank you, Jack.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.212
<i>Barbados is amazing;.</i>

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:25.544
<i>It's all coral
and turtles and booze...</i>

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.745
<i>Oh! You should be here.
Why aren't you here?</i>

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.620
<i>Yeah, and tell that
douchebag brother at mine</i>

00:03:30.644 --> 00:03:32.646
to take a day off for once, <i>would</i> ya?

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.384
<i>All right. Bye, Ana.
Bye!</i>

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.194
<i>So, how's the new job'?</i>

00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:18.801
It's good. My boss has me
weighing in on submissions.

00:04:19.726 --> 00:04:21.706
<i>That's exciting. Great.</i>

00:04:23.363 --> 00:04:25.070
Have you heard from Christian?

00:04:25.132 --> 00:04:26.611
Yeah.

00:04:27.567 --> 00:04:29.274
He sent me flowers.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.143
To wish me luck.

00:04:32.239 --> 00:04:33.718
<i>Sweetheart,</i>

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.618
are you ever gonna tell me
what happened between you?

00:04:39.646 --> 00:04:41.887
Fundamental
differences, I guess.

00:04:42.916 --> 00:04:44.918
It wasn't gonna last.

00:04:52.092 --> 00:04:53.400
Are those for me?

00:04:54.161 --> 00:04:55.606
Nah. They can wait.

00:04:55.762 --> 00:04:56.832
Okay.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:58.307
Look nice.
Going out tonight?

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:03.340
Oh, um, a friend of mine has a
photography exhibition opening tonight.

00:05:03.436 --> 00:05:04.938
So, gonna go.

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:06.306
Good.

00:05:07.107 --> 00:05:09.018
How did you make out
with those manuscripts?

00:05:09.342 --> 00:05:12.346
Oh, really great, actually.
This one, um...

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:14.283
Boyce Fox.

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:17.485
I couldn't put it down.
It's so sharp.

00:05:17.651 --> 00:05:21.121
And relevant. And I think
he's really got something.

00:05:21.288 --> 00:05:22.289
You think?
Yeah.

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:26.131
All right. I'll check it out.
Great.

00:05:26.359 --> 00:05:27.963
Have fun tonight, Ana.
Thank you.

00:05:28.128 --> 00:05:29.300
Thanks for today.

00:05:31.298 --> 00:05:32.299
Good night, Hannah.

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:34.271
Bye!

00:05:47.814 --> 00:05:49.992
Glass of chardonnay?

00:05:51.484 --> 00:05:52.554
Thanks.
Mmm-hmm.

00:06:08.535 --> 00:06:09.878
Oh, my God.

00:06:11.204 --> 00:06:13.013
Jesus Christ.

00:06:21.181 --> 00:06:22.182
Ana!

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:24.693
You made it.

00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.186
José...

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:30.224
This is, like, so much
of my face in here.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.837
Well, if I had asked, you would
have been like, "I'm too shy."

00:06:33.994 --> 00:06:34.994
Yeah.

00:06:35.028 --> 00:06:36.837
But you...

00:06:38.198 --> 00:06:39.336
It's my best stuff.

00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.876
That's so.“

00:06:41.701 --> 00:06:43.044
Do you like them?

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:47.848
They are super large.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:50.542
Hold on.

00:06:50.577 --> 00:06:53.888
All the portraits
have sold to one man.

00:06:55.548 --> 00:06:57.084
You're kidding!
No.

00:06:59.219 --> 00:07:02.928
Well, somebody likes them.

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.529
They just bought all six.

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:07.594
All six?

00:07:07.727 --> 00:07:09.570
Dinner's on me tonight, okay?

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.531
I'll be right back.

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.602
Anastasia.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:52.446
It was you, wasn't it? You just
went and bought all of these?

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:56.443
I don't like strangers
gawking at you.

00:07:57.811 --> 00:07:59.484
Why are you here?

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.121
For you.

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:05.425
Hey.

00:08:07.587 --> 00:08:09.794
Can we talk somewhere private?

00:08:09.956 --> 00:08:10.957
No.

00:08:11.458 --> 00:08:14.462
Look, I'm not very good at this.
I've never had to...

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:17.130
I've never wanted to try again.

00:08:19.332 --> 00:08:20.709
Christian, I don't...

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.643
It's not a good idea.
Let's talk.

00:08:22.769 --> 00:08:24.806
Okay? Just talk, please.

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:27.641
Have dinner with me.

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.187
Okay, fine. I will have
dinner with you.

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:39.993
Because I'm hungry.

00:08:40.153 --> 00:08:43.327
But we are only talking
and that is it.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.200
Hold on.

00:08:57.070 --> 00:08:58.743
Hey.
I'm gonna take off.

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:01.648
Already? Your photos
are so stunning, José.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:04.245
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm proud of you.

00:09:36.176 --> 00:09:39.248
Christian, I can't.
I can't do this.

00:09:40.013 --> 00:09:41.617
Christ, Ana.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.756
Okay.

00:09:47.854 --> 00:09:49.458
I have a proposition.

00:09:50.623 --> 00:09:53.035
Just come to dinner.
We can talk.

00:09:57.197 --> 00:09:58.374
Would you like some more time?

00:09:58.398 --> 00:10:02.244
No. Two steaks' medium.
Fries. Green vegetables.

00:10:02.869 --> 00:10:06.043
Um, actually, I'm gonna have
the quinoa salad.

00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:08.612
Fine.

00:10:08.775 --> 00:10:10.948
And two glasses of
the Barossa Valley Shiraz.

00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:13.057
We only sell that
by the bottle, sir.

00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:14.114
A bottle then.

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:15.619
Yes, Sir.

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:17.951
Thanks.

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:20.086
So?

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.097
Let's talk.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.062
I want you back.

00:10:30.763 --> 00:10:32.970
I'd like to renegotiate terms.

00:10:34.601 --> 00:10:36.410
But I don't see how.

00:10:38.805 --> 00:10:41.809
The things you want, you
said that's the way you are.

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:45.082
But what happened last time,
that's not gonna happen again.

00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:47.321
How can you say that?

00:10:49.149 --> 00:10:54.656
I know that I asked you
to show me how far it can go,

00:10:57.624 --> 00:11:00.798
but you were getting off
on the pain you inflicted.

00:11:04.631 --> 00:11:05.837
That's still in you.

00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:08.509
I'm working on it.

00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:10.443
Working on what?

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:16.184
I can't do this
if you won't talk to me.

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:19.513
What do you wanna know?

00:11:19.679 --> 00:11:21.317
Everything.

00:11:22.348 --> 00:11:23.520
Fine.

00:11:38.798 --> 00:11:39.868
Yeah. We'll manage.

00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:53.051
My birth mother died
when I was four.

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:55.523
She was an addict. Crack.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:58.161
You can fill in the blanks.

00:11:59.752 --> 00:12:00.863
Why didn't you tell me that?

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:01.888
I did.

00:12:02.322 --> 00:12:05.565
But you were asleep at the time.

00:12:06.993 --> 00:12:09.564
Okay. Well, um...

00:12:10.363 --> 00:12:11.535
Generally,

00:12:12.232 --> 00:12:14.838
a key part of good communication

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:18.405
is that both parties
be conscious.

00:12:20.707 --> 00:12:22.914
I'm really sorry
about your mother.

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.414
It's in the past.

00:12:28.548 --> 00:12:32.428
Now, I brought you here
to negotiate.

00:12:33.086 --> 00:12:35.123
You're open to new terms?

00:12:37.724 --> 00:12:39.067
No rules.

00:12:40.426 --> 00:12:41.598
No punishments.

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.076
No rules, no punishments

00:12:49.602 --> 00:12:51.104
and no more secrets.

00:12:52.772 --> 00:12:54.410
I can do that.

00:12:54.574 --> 00:12:55.814
You want a...

00:12:55.975 --> 00:12:57.613
What do you call it?

00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.954
A vanilla relationship?

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:03.151
I mean, we only do what
you're comfortable with.

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:06.125
But you need all those things.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:10.434
I need you more.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:19.632
Miss Steele.

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.005
Thanks, Taylor.

00:13:26.439 --> 00:13:27.975
No strings attached.

00:13:54.367 --> 00:13:56.142
This is spiky.

00:13:56.969 --> 00:13:58.209
I like it.

00:14:01.674 --> 00:14:03.176
I'll call you tomorrow.

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.511
Okay.

00:14:06.479 --> 00:14:07.685
Good night.

00:15:23.689 --> 00:15:27.193
Ana, I've been hearing a lot
of good things about you.

00:15:27.427 --> 00:15:28.872
- Oh...
- Told you, Liz.

00:15:29.095 --> 00:15:30.574
This one actually reads.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:31.731
Hey, Jack.

00:15:31.898 --> 00:15:34.338
What's the head of HR doing lurking around?
Are we in trouble?

00:15:35.635 --> 00:15:38.047
Not at all.
I'm just here to encourage.

00:15:38.538 --> 00:15:42.543
Really? Well, I think a round of
drinks at Lori's would do the trick.

00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:45.721
Sorry. Meetings.
Otherwise.

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:47.323
Who's Lori?

00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:49.426
Oh, it's a bar
around the corner.

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:51.922
Fridays are a bit of a ritual.

00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:54.260
You should come.

00:15:55.154 --> 00:15:56.758
Absolutely. Go network.

00:15:56.923 --> 00:16:00.735
Oh, no, I would. I have plans tonight.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.837
So have your plan come along.
Just for a quick one.

00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:06.937
Hello?

00:16:07.099 --> 00:16:08.100
Yeah.

00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:12.180
Have fun.

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.759
Anastasia.

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.930
I'm sorry.
Have we met before?

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.455
It's okay.

00:16:29.088 --> 00:16:30.260
I'm nobody.

00:16:30.857 --> 00:16:33.269
Hey. Lori's is this way.

00:16:33.426 --> 00:16:35.531
Come on, I'm buying.

00:16:40.132 --> 00:16:41.805
All right. Here we go.

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:43.606
Mmm. Thanks.

00:16:43.769 --> 00:16:45.112
Where is everyone?

00:16:45.271 --> 00:16:46.944
You know, it's still early.

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:51.050
Your comments on Boyce Fox
were interesting.

00:16:51.210 --> 00:16:52.985
I'm not usually
into political thrillers.

00:16:53.479 --> 00:16:55.390
Yeah, well' I think
the parallels

00:16:55.481 --> 00:16:57.620
with Dante's Inferno
are amazing, but...

00:16:57.783 --> 00:16:59.854
No. You convinced me.

00:16:59.952 --> 00:17:00.953
I'm reading.

00:17:01.621 --> 00:17:03.658
Oh. That's great.

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:06.464
Hi! He!

00:17:06.559 --> 00:17:07.697
Um, uh...

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:09.568
Christian, this is Jack Hyde.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:11.569
I'm the boyfriend.

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:14.635
I'm the boss.

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.074
What will you have, Chris?

00:17:17.403 --> 00:17:18.575
Thanks, Jack.

00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:20.342
Another time.

00:17:23.009 --> 00:17:24.352
Thanks.

00:17:28.581 --> 00:17:30.026
Another time.

00:17:31.017 --> 00:17:33.377
I can't believe you
just talked to him like that.

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.360
He wants what's mine.

00:17:35.421 --> 00:17:37.162
What's yours?

00:17:37.323 --> 00:17:39.200
That's a little presumptuous.

00:17:39.859 --> 00:17:42.840
He's my boss, Christian.
You gotta calm down.

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.206
Calm isn't really my forte.

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.680
I know something that could help.

00:17:55.408 --> 00:17:57.513
You know, this is not
what I had in mind.

00:17:58.878 --> 00:18:01.188
When's the last time
you went shopping?

00:18:01.781 --> 00:18:04.057
Houston. A week ago.

00:18:04.216 --> 00:18:05.593
What'd you buy?

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:07.196
An airline.

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:12.027
Here.

00:18:15.394 --> 00:18:17.396
Your new favorite flavor.

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.949
Excuse me.

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:41.562
Do you need a hand with that?

00:18:43.322 --> 00:18:44.767
I'll manage.

00:18:45.558 --> 00:18:46.662
Okay.

00:18:50.663 --> 00:18:51.903
I know what you're doing.

00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:54.510
What? I'm being
a culinary mastermind.

00:18:54.667 --> 00:18:56.738
You only have to ask.

00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:02.981
I think we should take it slow.

00:19:03.275 --> 00:19:04.413
Okay.

00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:07.524
Okay.
Okay.

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.861
Tell me about SIP.

00:19:13.019 --> 00:19:14.464
How's it going?

00:19:16.288 --> 00:19:17.631
It's good.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.670
Jack seems genuinely
interested in my opinion.

00:19:21.761 --> 00:19:23.263
What's morale like?

00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:24.364
Morale?

00:19:24.463 --> 00:19:26.063
You mean, like,
do we all sit in a circle

00:19:26.098 --> 00:19:28.138
and sing the company song in the morning?

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.976
Is the firm well managed?
Are people happy?

00:19:32.204 --> 00:19:33.205
Oh, my God.

00:19:33.305 --> 00:19:34.511
What?

00:19:35.274 --> 00:19:36.480
You're buying SIP?

00:19:37.843 --> 00:19:40.289
No! You can't do that.
That's my job.

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:42.223
You can't start
interfering in my career.

00:19:42.381 --> 00:19:44.292
It's not about that

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:48.023
I've wanted to move into publishing.
They' re the best fit.

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:51.290
But you're gonna be my boss.

00:19:51.791 --> 00:19:54.067
Technically, I'll be your
boss's boss's boss.

00:19:54.226 --> 00:19:57.070
And I'm gonna be sleeping
with my <i>boss's boss's boss.</i>

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.708
Right now,
you're arguing with him.

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.502
Yeah, because he's being an ass.

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:02.907
An ass. Really?

00:20:03.069 --> 00:20:04.377
Ass.

00:20:12.011 --> 00:20:13.012
Ooh...

00:20:15.014 --> 00:20:17.221
You know that's off limits.

00:20:20.186 --> 00:20:22.188
I'm gonna need a road map.

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:45.616
I thought you wanted to
take it slow.

00:20:50.216 --> 00:20:52.856
What do you want, Anastasia?

00:20:55.187 --> 00:20:57.861
If we're to communicate,
you have to tell me.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.203
I want you.

00:21:19.578 --> 00:21:21.387
I'm too dressed.

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.059
Keep going.

00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:01.591
Kiss me.

00:22:36.355 --> 00:22:38.301
What do you want, Anastasia?

00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:44.032
I want all of you.

00:23:22.368 --> 00:23:24.245
Why do you think you waited?

00:23:28.173 --> 00:23:29.413
For sex.

00:23:30.009 --> 00:23:31.010
<i>Mmm.</i>

00:23:32.678 --> 00:23:33.679
<i>Mmm.</i>

00:23:36.215 --> 00:23:40.357
I was reading Austen and Bronté

00:23:40.519 --> 00:23:43.261
and nobody ever
measured up to that.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:48.697
I guess I was waiting
for something exceptional.

00:23:50.696 --> 00:23:52.698
And then I met you.

00:23:56.435 --> 00:23:58.210
Would Miss Austen

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:01.985
approve of this?

00:24:04.043 --> 00:24:05.283
I was being romantic,

00:24:05.377 --> 00:24:08.381
and then you just go and distract
me with your kinky fuckery.

00:24:09.214 --> 00:24:11.057
"Kinky fuckery"?
Mmm-hmm.

00:24:11.550 --> 00:24:14.554
I don't know what that is,
but I like the sound of it.

00:24:52.524 --> 00:24:55.266
You looked so peaceful.
I didn't wanna wake you.

00:24:57.429 --> 00:24:59.272
There's not much for breakfast,

00:24:59.431 --> 00:25:01.433
unless you want
cold stir-fry.

00:25:01.967 --> 00:25:03.446
No.
Mmm.

00:25:07.106 --> 00:25:09.985
Here. The check you gave me for
Wanda, you should have it back.

00:25:10.142 --> 00:25:11.143
Keep it.

00:25:11.543 --> 00:25:13.887
Keep it? It's $24,000.

00:25:14.313 --> 00:25:15.553
Yeah, I know.

00:25:16.382 --> 00:25:19.056
I make that kind of money
every 15 minutes. Keep it.

00:25:42.841 --> 00:25:44.752
Andrea? Good morning.

00:25:45.744 --> 00:25:49.692
Could you please transfer $24,000 into
the account of Miss Anastasia Steele?

00:25:49.848 --> 00:25:50.918
No! What are you doing?

00:25:52.017 --> 00:25:53.894
That's fine.
Thank you.

00:25:56.255 --> 00:25:58.667
Why do you have
my bank account details?

00:25:59.425 --> 00:26:00.927
What's good for breakfast
around here?

00:26:01.026 --> 00:26:03.939
Christian, how do you
have my bank information?

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:10.110
Thank you.

00:26:12.371 --> 00:26:14.351
Gotta be quicker
than that, Grey.

00:26:18.444 --> 00:26:20.890
My parents are hosting
a charity ball tonight.

00:26:21.513 --> 00:26:23.049
I promised I'd make
an appearance.

00:26:23.515 --> 00:26:25.188
Want you to come with me.

00:26:27.286 --> 00:26:29.129
I've never been to a ball.

00:26:29.888 --> 00:26:31.890
I don't have a dress for that.

00:26:32.291 --> 00:26:34.362
Also, what am I gonna
do with my hair?

00:26:34.526 --> 00:26:35.869
I know a salon.

00:26:36.361 --> 00:26:38.432
And you don't need to
worry about a dress.

00:26:38.597 --> 00:26:40.099
It's all gonna be taken care of.

00:26:42.367 --> 00:26:44.472
What is it'?
Um...

00:26:45.804 --> 00:26:47.112
There was just a girl
over there.

00:26:47.206 --> 00:26:49.152
And she was outside
my office yesterday.

00:26:50.209 --> 00:26:51.950
And she knew my name.

00:26:52.111 --> 00:26:55.456
And she had a bandage on her wrist.
It was really strange.

00:26:57.950 --> 00:26:59.896
We should go.

00:27:04.123 --> 00:27:05.500
Just now.

00:27:05.958 --> 00:27:07.096
Yeah.

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:09.067
Keep me informed.

00:27:13.098 --> 00:27:14.805
You know that girl, Christian?

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.005
I'm handling it.
What does that mean?

00:27:17.803 --> 00:27:20.181
I don't want you to worry about it.
Trust me.

00:27:28.847 --> 00:27:29.848
Um...

00:27:32.484 --> 00:27:34.430
Hey, how are you doing?

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:37.760
Good, okay. So, uh,
my girlfriend's here...

00:27:45.864 --> 00:27:46.865
Oh.

00:28:19.965 --> 00:28:20.966
Ana.

00:28:23.969 --> 00:28:25.812
Was that Mrs. Robinson?

00:28:26.638 --> 00:28:27.708
Her name's Elena Lincoln.

00:28:28.006 --> 00:28:29.606
I don't care what her
name is, Christian.

00:28:29.641 --> 00:28:31.314
Why would you take me there?

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:34.915
Why would you take me to meet the
woman who seduced and abused you?

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:38.222
Our relationship ended years ago.
We're just friends.

00:28:38.383 --> 00:28:39.521
And business partners.

00:28:39.885 --> 00:28:41.865
Business partners?
Are you kidding me?

00:28:43.488 --> 00:28:45.365
Would you take your Subs there?

00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.562
Oh, my God! For what?
Her approval?

00:28:50.662 --> 00:28:51.732
What?
What is this?

00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:53.901
No. It's not like that.

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:56.740
That girl that I saw this morning
was one of them, wasn't she?

00:28:57.669 --> 00:28:59.080
Let's discuss this
back at my place.

00:28:59.171 --> 00:29:00.771
I can have someone
come by, do your hair.

00:29:00.839 --> 00:29:02.317
Christian, I don't care
about my hair!

00:29:02.341 --> 00:29:03.877
Explain to me what's going on.

00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:06.352
I'll explain when
we're there. Come on.

00:29:07.546 --> 00:29:09.856
Okay, you can either walk or I
can carry you. Your choice.

00:29:10.015 --> 00:29:12.222
You wouldn't do that.
No, it's your choice.

00:29:14.353 --> 00:29:16.526
Okay, fine. Fine.
I'll walk.

00:29:21.093 --> 00:29:23.198
Her name's Leila Williams.

00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:25.905
She was my Sub for a while
about two years ago.

00:29:26.865 --> 00:29:28.538
What happened to her?

00:29:29.434 --> 00:29:31.744
She wanted more.
I didn't.

00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:33.773
So I ended it.

00:29:35.374 --> 00:29:37.615
She left. Got married.

00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:40.780
I thought she moved on, but then
her husband died in a car crash.

00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:42.619
She had a breakdown.

00:29:46.118 --> 00:29:47.563
What does she want now?

00:29:49.288 --> 00:29:51.632
When you and I were in Georgia
together, she turned up here

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:54.761
and tried to slit her wrists in front
of Mrs. Jones, my housekeeper.

00:29:55.594 --> 00:29:56.732
Oh, my God.

00:29:56.895 --> 00:30:00.001
Gail took her to the hospital,
but by the time I got there,

00:30:00.098 --> 00:30:01.406
she'd taken off.

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:04.240
My people have been
trying to find her.

00:30:04.770 --> 00:30:06.113
Your people?

00:30:07.906 --> 00:30:10.250
Is that who put this together?

00:30:14.413 --> 00:30:15.915
Is there one on me?

00:30:21.286 --> 00:30:22.492
Let me see it.

00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:53.786
"Subject works part time at
Clayton's Hardware, Richmond Road."

00:30:54.619 --> 00:30:57.964
You know, they didn't time
my bathroom breaks.

00:30:59.191 --> 00:31:01.501
You should probably
get your money back.

00:31:02.627 --> 00:31:05.301
I had them drawn up on any
prospective Submissive.

00:31:05.497 --> 00:31:08.205
Nice. Jesus.

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:10.472
I had no idea what
this was gonna become.

00:31:10.635 --> 00:31:11.915
I didn't know
you'd be different.

00:31:11.970 --> 00:31:14.314
Different? Really?

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:18.711
Is that why you brought me
to Mrs. Robinson's,

00:31:18.877 --> 00:31:22.154
where you brought all the other women?
Because I'm so different?

00:31:23.548 --> 00:31:25.323
That was wrong. I admit.

00:31:25.484 --> 00:31:28.488
It's all wrong.
All of this is wrong.

00:31:30.822 --> 00:31:34.668
You put money into my account that...
I don't want it.

00:31:35.026 --> 00:31:38.064
You bought the company
I work for.

00:31:38.730 --> 00:31:42.041
This isn't a relationship,
Christian. It's ownership.

00:31:44.503 --> 00:31:46.210
I'm trying to understand you.

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:51.847
I am just wanting to
get close to you.

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:56.115
But it's really difficult to
do that when you keep doing

00:31:56.214 --> 00:31:57.852
bizarre things like this.

00:31:58.016 --> 00:32:00.736
And it's really difficult to do that
when you won't let me touch you.

00:32:10.562 --> 00:32:12.235
Come to my bedroom.

00:32:13.732 --> 00:32:16.611
Sex is not gonna fix this
right now. Are you insane?

00:32:16.701 --> 00:32:18.806
Ana, please.

00:32:23.608 --> 00:32:25.485
You wanted a road map?

00:32:40.425 --> 00:32:41.665
Start here.

00:33:16.761 --> 00:33:18.536
Those are my boundaries.

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:25.341
I can live with that.

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:28.809
Then I'm all yours.

00:33:36.214 --> 00:33:38.558
<i>Mr. Grey,
your appointment's arrived,</i>

00:33:39.351 --> 00:33:41.456
Okay. Send him
into Ana's room.

00:33:43.121 --> 00:33:44.122
He's here.

00:33:44.789 --> 00:33:46.200
Who's here?

00:33:50.829 --> 00:33:51.830
Wow.

00:33:52.464 --> 00:33:54.068
Hair up, I think. Yes?

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:57.145
Your neck is beautiful.

00:33:58.203 --> 00:33:59.375
Christian'?

00:34:04.743 --> 00:34:05.744
<i>Ciao, Bella.</i>

00:34:53.258 --> 00:34:55.534
You're just gonna
stand there gawking?

00:34:56.094 --> 00:34:57.232
Yeah.

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.033
Yeah, I think I might.

00:35:18.416 --> 00:35:20.089
So I was thinking

00:35:20.986 --> 00:35:23.796
tonight might be
more stimulating

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:25.593
if you wear these.

00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.763
How am I supposed to wear those?

00:35:33.665 --> 00:35:34.803
Well,

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:37.605
you have to get them wet first.

00:35:38.903 --> 00:35:40.075
Curious?

00:35:42.974 --> 00:35:43.975
Mmm-hmm.

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:45.913
Okay.

00:35:47.012 --> 00:35:48.286
Open your mouth.

00:35:57.589 --> 00:35:58.590
Good.

00:36:01.693 --> 00:36:04.037
Now turn. Bend over.

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:07.670
No, you're not putting
those in my butt.

00:36:07.866 --> 00:36:10.472
They don't go in your butt.

00:36:31.022 --> 00:36:32.228
Stay still.

00:36:39.998 --> 00:36:42.205
Stand up straight
and turn around.

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:52.988
How's it feel?

00:36:53.211 --> 00:36:54.212
Mmm...

00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.652
Weird.

00:36:58.349 --> 00:36:59.760
But good.

00:37:00.985 --> 00:37:03.261
What do they do?

00:37:05.757 --> 00:37:07.532
You'll find oui.

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:11.835
Wear the silver satin.

00:37:11.996 --> 00:37:13.942
It'll go well with these.

00:37:17.769 --> 00:37:21.239
Don't worry. They're for your ears.

00:37:43.094 --> 00:37:44.454
Did I mention it was
a masked ball?

00:37:44.696 --> 00:37:45.697
No.

00:37:50.135 --> 00:37:52.911
Your new bodyguards
need to wear these, too?

00:37:53.972 --> 00:37:55.144
I'm just being safe.

00:37:55.306 --> 00:37:57.445
You won't even notice
they're here.

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:00.981
Come on.

00:38:16.928 --> 00:38:19.966
<i>The way you wear your hat.</i>

00:38:21.566 --> 00:38:24.069
<i>The way you sip your tea.</i>

00:38:25.937 --> 00:38:29.646
<i>The memory of alt that.</i>

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:34.480
<i>No, no, they can't take that
away from me.</i>

00:38:34.946 --> 00:38:38.086
<i>The way your smile just beams.</i>

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:42.131
<i>The way you sing off-key.</i>

00:38:43.354 --> 00:38:45.197
Everybody's looking at us.

00:38:45.356 --> 00:38:47.267
Not us. You.

00:38:47.425 --> 00:38:50.838
Christian! I'm so glad you made it.
Mother.

00:38:50.929 --> 00:38:52.875
"Mother" is so formal.
Honestly.

00:38:53.031 --> 00:38:54.135
Ana.
Hi.

00:38:54.632 --> 00:38:55.667
How you doing?

00:38:55.767 --> 00:38:58.714
These things are beautiful,
and they are mysterious,

00:38:58.837 --> 00:39:00.874
but they're a pain in the ass.

00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:03.880
You look spectacular.

00:39:04.309 --> 00:39:07.188
Thank you. So do you.
This dress is so beautiful.

00:39:07.345 --> 00:39:08.449
Thank you, Ana.

00:39:08.613 --> 00:39:11.184
I'm so glad you're back
with Christian.

00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.487
He was lost without you.

00:39:12.650 --> 00:39:14.129
Oh. Can I have my
date back, please?

00:39:14.285 --> 00:39:16.856
By all means. Spoilsport.

00:39:17.322 --> 00:39:18.801
See you later.

00:39:23.895 --> 00:39:27.968
<i>No, no, they can't take that
away from me</i>

00:39:30.635 --> 00:39:33.479
Ana! My God!

00:39:33.638 --> 00:39:36.983
That dress, it should be illegal.
Monique Lhuillier.

00:39:37.041 --> 00:39:38.520
Yeah. Mia.

00:39:38.877 --> 00:39:41.221
Mia, you know
I barely recognized you.

00:39:41.379 --> 00:39:43.757
Yeah! The new me.
Okay, what do you think?

00:39:44.682 --> 00:39:46.992
Well, it's very, uh, blonde.

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.720
How do you put up with him?

00:39:48.887 --> 00:39:51.766
Do you know he was an even
bigger pain as a teenager?

00:39:51.923 --> 00:39:54.995
He got expelled from four
different schools for brawling.

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:57.230
That's enough. Yeah,
totally out of control.

00:39:57.395 --> 00:39:59.170
- Mia, enough.
- Mia?

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.868
I'll be right back.

00:40:01.232 --> 00:40:02.540
Hi! How are you?

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:03.838
Hmm?
Ana?

00:40:04.002 --> 00:40:06.846
You will be sitting here, darling.
Right next to Cary.

00:40:07.005 --> 00:40:08.006
Christian, you over here.

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:11.016
<i>Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, to our annual ball.</i>

00:40:11.709 --> 00:40:13.518
<i>As you know,
proceeds from this evening</i>

00:40:13.578 --> 00:40:17.082
<i>will go to the charity that Grace
and</i> I <i>founded so many years ago...</i>

00:40:17.248 --> 00:40:19.194
<i>Coping Together.</i>

00:40:19.350 --> 00:40:21.161
<i>Working to make fife better for
the children...</i>

00:40:21.185 --> 00:40:23.722
of parents addicted to drugs.

00:40:24.222 --> 00:40:25.223
Everything okay?

00:40:25.390 --> 00:40:27.097
<i>And now, thankfully,</i>

00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:28.898
<i>I will be handing off
my speaking duties</i>

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:32.234
<i>to our master of ceremonies,
Mr. Nomad Paul.</i>

00:40:33.431 --> 00:40:36.139
<i>Thank you, Mr. Grey, and
thank you, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

00:40:36.234 --> 00:40:37.372
Hungry?

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.255
<i>Let's start the bidding
with lot number one.</i>

00:40:39.370 --> 00:40:40.371
Ravenous.

00:40:40.538 --> 00:40:42.381
- Do <i>I</i> hear $10, 000?
- Ten!

00:40:42.874 --> 00:40:45.115
Now you know what those
silver balls do.

00:40:45.276 --> 00:40:46.277
$15,000.

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:48.113
<i>$15,000.</i>

00:40:48.579 --> 00:40:51.389
<i>Going once, going twice...</i>

00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:52.550
<i>Said!</i>

00:40:54.786 --> 00:40:58.131
<i>That's a great start, ladies and gentlemen.
New, lot number two,</i>

00:40:58.456 --> 00:41:02.404
a <i>week's vacation at'</i> a <i>luxury
chalet in Aspen, Colorado,</i>

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.836
<i>donated by
Mr. Christian Grey.</i>

00:41:04.929 --> 00:41:05.930
<i>Mmm.</i>

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:08.475
<i>Let's start the bidding off
at $10, 000.</i>

00:41:08.967 --> 00:41:09.968
$10,000!

00:41:10.068 --> 00:41:11.809
<i>Thank you, ma'am. $10,000.</i>

00:41:12.136 --> 00:41:13.911
I didn't know
you had a place in Aspen.

00:41:14.572 --> 00:41:16.108
I have a lot of places.

00:41:16.274 --> 00:41:18.419
<i>Boy, we have some ski
lovers in the room tonight.</i>

00:41:18.443 --> 00:41:19.478
$17,000!

00:41:19.644 --> 00:41:22.090
<i>$17,000. Thank you, sir. 18?</i>

00:41:22.146 --> 00:41:24.251
$18,000.
$18,000.

00:41:24.415 --> 00:41:26.088
<i>Thank you. Do I hear 19? 19?</i>

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.185
19.

00:41:27.285 --> 00:41:29.265
<i>$19,000. Thank you, sir.</i>

00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.492
<i>A week of luxury in
America's finest ski resort.</i>

00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:34.136
$24,000.

00:41:34.292 --> 00:41:37.762
<i>New blood! $24, 000 I am bid.</i>

00:41:37.962 --> 00:41:39.669
<i>Do I hear $25,000'?</i>

00:41:39.764 --> 00:41:40.936
That money was for you.

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:43.272
And now it'll go to
someone who needs it.

00:41:43.935 --> 00:41:48.111
I don't know whether to worship
at your feet or spank you.

00:41:48.272 --> 00:41:50.843
<i>$24,000.
Going once...</i>

00:41:51.776 --> 00:41:53.483
<i>I think...
Going twice...</i>

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:54.816
I'll take option two.

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:58.525
<i>Sold! To the young lady
in silver.</i>

00:42:03.788 --> 00:42:06.792
<i>Your generosity realty makes a
difference, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

00:42:06.958 --> 00:42:07.993
Let's go.

00:42:34.886 --> 00:42:35.990
You want this?

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.063
I want you to spank me.

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:53.842
Hands.

00:43:16.394 --> 00:43:19.375
If it gets too much, you have
to tell me to stop, understood?

00:43:20.031 --> 00:43:21.032
Yes.

00:43:51.896 --> 00:43:52.931
Hold still.

00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:28.136
I want you to come, Ana.

00:44:28.299 --> 00:44:29.642
Come for me.

00:44:48.152 --> 00:44:50.291
Is this your room?

00:44:50.788 --> 00:44:52.131
Once upon a time.

00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:13.015
Who's this?

00:45:17.048 --> 00:45:18.391
Is that your mother?

00:45:25.656 --> 00:45:28.159
You know you can just say you
don't wanna talk about it.

00:45:28.492 --> 00:45:31.234
Yeah, I don't wanna
talk about it.

00:45:33.164 --> 00:45:35.235
Let's go.
They'll be missing us.

00:45:36.667 --> 00:45:39.580
Uh, I just need a minute.

00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:41.547
I'll meet you downstairs.

00:45:41.872 --> 00:45:42.873
Okay.

00:45:44.342 --> 00:45:45.912
Don't forget your mask.

00:46:14.705 --> 00:46:16.878
<i>Under my skin.</i>

00:46:19.210 --> 00:46:22.783
<i>I'd sacrifice anything
come what might.</i>

00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:24.757
<i>For the sake of having you near.</i>

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:25.916
What?

00:46:26.784 --> 00:46:27.888
Nothing.

00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:33.627
<i>Comes in the night And repeats
and repeats in my ear.</i>

00:46:33.791 --> 00:46:39.104
<i>Don't you know, little fool
You never can win</i>

00:46:51.242 --> 00:46:52.915
Christian has a date.

00:46:53.844 --> 00:46:55.346
I'm impressed.

00:46:56.514 --> 00:46:58.016
I'm sorry.

00:46:58.949 --> 00:47:00.121
Elena.

00:47:00.284 --> 00:47:02.321
I wanted to meet you.

00:47:04.789 --> 00:47:06.700
I can't say the same.
Excuse me.

00:47:06.857 --> 00:47:09.360
Hey, I'm not the enemy.

00:47:11.529 --> 00:47:14.135
I know what you did
to Christian.

00:47:14.298 --> 00:47:17.836
All I did was lead him to the
truth of who he really is.

00:47:18.002 --> 00:47:21.643
Without me, he'd be
in jail or dead.

00:47:21.806 --> 00:47:23.183
And he would say the same.

00:47:23.274 --> 00:47:24.314
I'm not listening to this.

00:47:24.375 --> 00:47:28.118
Do you think you're the first
woman he'd hoped would save him?

00:47:28.713 --> 00:47:32.183
He needs a Submissive in life.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:34.193
Not just in the bedroom.

00:47:35.386 --> 00:47:37.662
No, he's changing that.

00:47:38.189 --> 00:47:39.793
It's not what he wants anymore.

00:47:39.957 --> 00:47:41.527
But it's what he needs.

00:47:41.692 --> 00:47:45.003
And you don't strike me as the type
of woman who wants to be owned.

00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:49.334
If you really wanna make him
happy, if you wanna be happy,

00:47:50.067 --> 00:47:51.546
you'll let him go.

00:47:52.303 --> 00:47:56.809
There's no way that someone like you
could ever understand what we have.

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:58.647
I've been there.

00:47:58.809 --> 00:48:00.720
Nothing lasts.

00:48:01.312 --> 00:48:02.313
Nothing.

00:48:03.013 --> 00:48:05.721
Whatever happens
between me and Christian

00:48:05.816 --> 00:48:07.853
is none of your
goddamn business.

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:10.089
So you stay the fuck
away from us.

00:48:16.861 --> 00:48:19.432
Hey, we should
think about going soon.

00:48:19.597 --> 00:48:21.167
I wanna go now.

00:48:30.674 --> 00:48:32.585
What did Elena say to you'?

00:48:37.915 --> 00:48:40.555
Nothing I didn't already know.

00:48:44.455 --> 00:48:46.628
Will you just take me
to my house?

00:48:47.792 --> 00:48:49.430
Stay with me tonight.

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:03.951
Hey, wake up.
We're home. Hmm.

00:49:11.148 --> 00:49:12.149
Sir?

00:49:13.951 --> 00:49:15.225
Stay here.

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:43.249
We'll have the car towed.

00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:44.757
What happened?

00:49:45.316 --> 00:49:47.762
That's my car!
What happened to my car?

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:49.296
Check the apartment.
Call me when it's safe.

00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:50.697
Yes, sir. Right away.
Copy that

00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:52.357
Smith, you stick
with Mr. Grey.

00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:56.100
Where are we going?

00:49:56.694 --> 00:49:58.139
Christian'?

00:49:59.196 --> 00:50:01.005
<i>Do</i> you <i>think</i> it was <i>Leila?</i>

00:50:01.165 --> 00:50:03.668
<i>You really think she would
do something like that?</i>

00:50:07.204 --> 00:50:09.516
I really don't see why we can't
just go back to your apartment.

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.645
That place is like a fortress.

00:50:11.809 --> 00:50:13.982
There's no way she could
have gotten in there.

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:17.182
She shouldn't have been able to
get into the garage, either.

00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:19.191
I'm not taking any chances.

00:50:27.191 --> 00:50:28.693
Good evening, Mr. Grey.

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:29.997
Hey, Ed.

00:50:31.962 --> 00:50:34.033
The rest of the crew
will be here in the morning.

00:50:40.638 --> 00:50:43.380
If something were to happen
to you because of me...

00:50:44.041 --> 00:50:45.384
It won't.

00:50:46.143 --> 00:50:48.054
Nothing's gonna happen to me.

00:50:55.986 --> 00:50:57.659
Can I wash this off?

00:51:01.158 --> 00:51:03.001
Don't stray from the lines.

00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.264
Okay.

00:51:35.793 --> 00:51:37.534
Are these burns?

00:51:39.697 --> 00:51:41.699
Who did this to you?

00:51:43.634 --> 00:51:45.272
Go on, it's over.

00:51:52.042 --> 00:51:57.993
I know how difficult it is
for you to open up to me

00:52:00.217 --> 00:52:02.163
and tell me these things.

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:08.297
But it means the world to me.

00:52:09.793 --> 00:52:11.966
It means you love me.

00:52:13.664 --> 00:52:16.406
Yes, I do.

00:52:45.029 --> 00:52:48.101
So this is where your knot-tying
expertise comes from.

00:52:48.265 --> 00:52:49.608
Good morning.

00:52:50.434 --> 00:52:51.606
Sleep well?

00:52:51.769 --> 00:52:52.873
I did.

00:52:55.773 --> 00:52:57.548
This boat is really beautiful.

00:52:58.275 --> 00:53:00.186
This is from my yard in Seattle.

00:53:00.611 --> 00:53:01.885
You built it?

00:53:02.012 --> 00:53:04.652
I had some help.

00:53:04.715 --> 00:53:06.353
It's called The Grace.

00:53:08.052 --> 00:53:09.463
After your mom?

00:53:10.454 --> 00:53:12.229
You sound surprised.

00:53:12.389 --> 00:53:15.233
Well, you're always
so cool towards her.

00:53:16.226 --> 00:53:18.137
I owe everything to Grace.

00:53:18.295 --> 00:53:20.798
She saved my life
after my birth mom died.

00:53:23.634 --> 00:53:25.807
Do you remember your birth mom?

00:53:25.969 --> 00:53:27.539
I try not to.

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:32.209
What happened to her?

00:53:33.477 --> 00:53:34.547
She overdosed.

00:53:34.645 --> 00:53:37.251
They found her body
three days later.

00:53:39.717 --> 00:53:41.219
Where were you?

00:53:41.385 --> 00:53:42.591
I was with her.

00:53:44.755 --> 00:53:46.166
Oh, my God.

00:53:47.891 --> 00:53:49.666
Took her away.
Took me to a hospital.

00:53:51.228 --> 00:53:52.673
<i>Grace was there.</i>

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.946
Thank you for telling me.

00:54:04.074 --> 00:54:05.849
Look at that house.

00:54:08.011 --> 00:54:11.254
That's beautiful.
The view's probably amazing.

00:54:11.348 --> 00:54:13.055
I wonder who lives there.

00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:15.797
It's an old sea widow.

00:54:15.953 --> 00:54:18.024
Lost her husband years ago.

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:21.260
Sits at the window every night
waiting for him to come home.

00:54:22.693 --> 00:54:24.536
Did you just make that up?

00:54:24.695 --> 00:54:25.696
Yeah.

00:54:28.766 --> 00:54:30.370
You wanna take the helm?

00:54:30.434 --> 00:54:31.435
Me?

00:54:31.535 --> 00:54:33.378
Yeah, you. Come on.

00:54:33.537 --> 00:54:35.881
I can't do that.

00:54:57.961 --> 00:54:59.406
See where I'm looking'?
Yeah.

00:54:59.563 --> 00:55:00.564
Right there. Just hold.

00:55:00.831 --> 00:55:02.139
Okay?
Okay.

00:55:10.307 --> 00:55:11.718
No, you're fine, Ana.
I'm still here.

00:55:11.742 --> 00:55:12.777
Don't let go.

00:55:12.843 --> 00:55:14.083
I have to let go.
Don't.

00:55:14.244 --> 00:55:15.416
Oh, my God. Okay.
Okay?

00:55:15.579 --> 00:55:17.320
You ready?
Okay.

00:55:32.196 --> 00:55:34.608
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
I'm steering it.

00:55:34.765 --> 00:55:36.767
I'm doing it.
I'm the captain.

00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:43.944
Oh, my God!

00:55:51.782 --> 00:55:53.557
Hey.
Hey, Jack.

00:55:53.717 --> 00:55:56.027
Personal calls on your
own time, okay?

00:56:04.962 --> 00:56:05.997
Yeah?

00:56:06.063 --> 00:56:07.667
Um, did you get my message?

00:56:08.131 --> 00:56:12.341
You had a phone call this morning
with Ruth Carusi at 9:00 a.m.

00:56:12.669 --> 00:56:13.704
Shit.

00:56:14.471 --> 00:56:16.382
Loan just reschedule it.
I'll ask them.

00:56:16.540 --> 00:56:19.316
Did you book our rooms
for New York yet?

00:56:20.244 --> 00:56:21.245
Sorry?

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:24.484
New York. Book expo. This Friday.
It's in the diary.

00:56:24.548 --> 00:56:27.188
No, yeah, I know. Yeah, I
booked your room. Of course.

00:56:27.718 --> 00:56:28.924
And you.

00:56:29.086 --> 00:56:31.430
It's expected that
my assistant also attends.

00:56:33.523 --> 00:56:35.196
I didn't know that.
I'm sorry.

00:56:35.359 --> 00:56:36.429
Don't apologize.

00:56:36.593 --> 00:56:38.595
Just get yourself a room.

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:42.737
Unless you'd rather stay
back with your boyfriend.

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.077
I mean, ifs not like
you need to work.

00:56:48.438 --> 00:56:49.746
I'll sort it out.

00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.020
Eric, hey. It's Jack.
How was your weekend?

00:56:54.912 --> 00:56:56.186
No shit.

00:56:56.914 --> 00:56:59.554
Mine was great.
It was fantastic.

00:57:00.517 --> 00:57:02.622
Yeah, 'cause I read
your new pages.

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:05.359
No, they're amazing.
Amazing.

00:57:06.290 --> 00:57:07.860
No, I couldn't put it down.

00:57:08.025 --> 00:57:10.369
We'll be accessing state and
federal grants of course,

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:12.338
but more than 70% of the funding...

00:57:12.362 --> 00:57:15.536
will come directly from
Grey Enterprises Holdings.

00:57:15.599 --> 00:57:17.704
We'll be making cutting edge
renewable energy tech

00:57:17.768 --> 00:57:19.441
that will more than
repay our investment.

00:57:42.492 --> 00:57:44.301
Provides a solid consumer base.

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:45.896
For our products.

00:57:46.063 --> 00:57:48.339
We're aware that
you have other bidders

00:57:48.432 --> 00:57:52.073
and some of them may offer what
look like better terms, but...

00:58:06.083 --> 00:58:07.153
Hello?

00:58:11.121 --> 00:58:12.191
Christian'?

00:58:14.524 --> 00:58:16.299
Oh, my God!

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:18.671
Oh, excuse me, Miss Steele,
I didn't mean to startle you.

00:58:18.695 --> 00:58:20.368
No, no.

00:58:20.931 --> 00:58:22.308
You are very quiet.

00:58:22.766 --> 00:58:25.474
I'm Mrs. Jones. Mr. Grey's
housekeeper. May I?

00:58:25.869 --> 00:58:26.870
Oh, um...

00:58:27.938 --> 00:58:29.645
Sure. Thank you.

00:58:30.974 --> 00:58:32.009
Um, I'm Ana.

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:36.146
But you knew that already
because you said my last name.

00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.192
Mr. Grey is in his study,
just finishing up a call.

00:58:39.649 --> 00:58:42.061
I'll be in the kitchen
if you need me. Okay.

01:00:06.069 --> 01:00:07.275
See anything you like?

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:10.216
Oh, fuck.

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.449
The door was, um, unlocked.

01:00:16.146 --> 01:00:18.285
I'll have to talk to
Mrs. Jones.

01:00:20.650 --> 01:00:22.721
Does she come in here a lot?

01:00:25.755 --> 01:00:27.325
Does she dust in here?

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:30.935
Those are nipple clamps.

01:00:35.899 --> 01:00:37.606
Come here.
Give me your hand.

01:00:49.579 --> 01:00:51.991
It's even more intense
when you take them off.

01:00:53.683 --> 01:00:56.163
Ow.

01:01:06.830 --> 01:01:08.275
What's this?

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:11.101
Okay.

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.109
That's enough show-and-tell.

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.647
What's this?

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:19.146
Let's learn to walk
before we run.

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:22.789
I kinda like running.

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:27.117
Ana?
Mmm-hmm?

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:33.198
Last time we did this,
you saw another side of me.

01:01:33.990 --> 01:01:35.230
And you left.

01:01:37.294 --> 01:01:39.205
Last time was different.

01:01:45.202 --> 01:01:47.546
All right. But not here.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:51.547
Mrs. Jones.

01:01:52.676 --> 01:01:54.383
Oh, my God.

01:03:28.772 --> 01:03:29.842
You're mine.

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:32.916
I'm yours.

01:04:02.772 --> 01:04:04.615
You okay?
Yeah.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:44.891
You know at some point we're
gonna need to talk about New York.

01:04:44.981 --> 01:04:46.483
We have talked about it.

01:04:46.649 --> 01:04:49.323
You forbidding it is
not us talking about it.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.994
If you wanna go to New
York, don't go with Hyde.

01:04:53.156 --> 01:04:54.863
Let me take you.
I have a place there.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:57.168
Of course you do.

01:04:57.227 --> 01:04:58.900
This isn't
some sort of vacation.

01:04:58.995 --> 01:05:02.738
It's a work trip with <i>my</i> boss,
who I would like to impress.

01:05:03.867 --> 01:05:06.108
You know he's had three
assistants in the last 18 months,

01:05:06.202 --> 01:05:07.943
all of whom have quit
without notice?

01:05:08.037 --> 01:05:09.516
You don't think
I can handle him?

01:05:09.672 --> 01:05:11.413
That's not il.

01:05:11.841 --> 01:05:13.718
That's what it feels like.

01:05:15.578 --> 01:05:18.684
Ana, I know full well
that you can handle anything.

01:05:18.848 --> 01:05:22.261
And, uh, if you really wanna go,

01:05:22.419 --> 01:05:23.921
then I can't stop you.

01:05:24.721 --> 01:05:26.564
But I'd like to
take you there myself.

01:05:31.694 --> 01:05:32.695
Okay.

01:05:34.197 --> 01:05:35.574
Okay?

01:05:36.199 --> 01:05:37.200
Yeah.

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:41.408
I mean, of course I would
rather see New York with you.

01:05:42.205 --> 01:05:43.206
Good.

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:45.415
I hate it when we fight.

01:05:46.709 --> 01:05:48.245
That wasn't a fight.

01:05:49.446 --> 01:05:51.722
That was a conversation.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:55.454
It was, you know, when somebody
talks, and the other person listens,

01:05:55.618 --> 01:05:57.222
and you resolve an issue.

01:05:57.420 --> 01:05:58.763
That's how it works.

01:05:58.922 --> 01:06:00.230
It's crazy, isn't it?

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:04.063
Night, Ana.

01:06:04.227 --> 01:06:05.467
Good night, Hannah.

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:32.660
You leaving?

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:37.127
Um, I was actually just about to come
talk to you. Uh, about New York.

01:06:38.094 --> 01:06:39.471
There a problem?

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:40.663
Um...

01:06:41.664 --> 01:06:44.543
I'm so grateful
for the opportunity, Jack,

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:46.773
but with such short notice,
I made plans

01:06:46.836 --> 01:06:47.940
that I can't change.
Huh.

01:06:48.938 --> 01:06:51.009
But I will have my phone
on me all weekend.

01:06:51.107 --> 01:06:53.713
So if you need anything,
I'm available.

01:06:55.678 --> 01:06:57.282
<i>Ana, have a seat.</i>

01:07:00.650 --> 01:07:02.459
I'm really... I'm sorry.

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:07.791
I think you have
tremendous potential here.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.232
But I don't wanna waste my time

01:07:10.326 --> 01:07:12.966
training someone who doesn't
take this position seriously.

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:14.199
I do.

01:07:15.298 --> 01:07:16.641
This is my dream job.

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:20.474
Then shouldn't going to New York and
the book expo be part of that dream?

01:07:20.537 --> 01:07:21.641
It is.

01:07:22.305 --> 01:07:23.909
It is.

01:07:24.007 --> 01:07:26.214
It was just a misunderstanding.
It won't happen again.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:31.189
Because there are plenty of qualified
people who would kill for this job.

01:07:31.347 --> 01:07:35.693
I mean, look, I don't wanna brag,
but I'm a pretty great teacher.

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:38.825
I'm sure you are.

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:42.834
I'm just not seeing the
initiative on your side of it.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:46.247
I've read more than
you've asked me to.

01:07:46.863 --> 01:07:49.241
And I'm on top of everything...

01:07:49.332 --> 01:07:53.405
I'm talking about
going the extra mile.

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:56.373
Unless you want me

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:59.752
to compete with Christian Grey

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:02.381
for your attention.

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:08.223
I apologize that Christian was so
curt with you the other night.

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:09.920
Is that what this is about?

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:15.362
Your boyfriend has
a reputation for being

01:08:16.259 --> 01:08:17.897
a little ruthless.

01:08:18.061 --> 01:08:19.734
Is that what you like?

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:22.942
If you have a problem with my work,
then you should take it up with HR.

01:08:22.966 --> 01:08:24.036
Whoa.

01:08:24.601 --> 01:08:26.877
Why are you being so serious?

01:08:27.370 --> 01:08:29.941
What do you think I'm gonna do'?
Make you fuck me?

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:31.107
Jack.

01:08:32.075 --> 01:08:33.713
I just think...

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.788
I just think

01:08:38.081 --> 01:08:40.391
if you're gonna fuck
your way to prominence,

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:45.456
then you should do it with someone
who can at least make you smarter.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.728
Not just richer.

01:08:49.092 --> 01:08:50.093
Right?

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:53.738
Don't...
Don't what'? Hmm?

01:08:55.231 --> 01:08:59.407
Look, this is a serious,
serious question.

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:02.572
Do you wanna be kept

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:07.747
or taken seriously?
Hmm?

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:09.915
I would like to leave,
please, Jack.

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:11.251
Plus...

01:09:13.416 --> 01:09:18.593
I can make you come
like nobody else has.

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:21.260
Not him.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:23.431
Not anyone.

01:09:23.493 --> 01:09:24.494
No.

01:09:35.438 --> 01:09:36.815
Ana?
Ana, what happened?

01:09:36.973 --> 01:09:41.786
Jack Hyde tried to touch me.

01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:42.845
I'll kill him.

01:09:42.945 --> 01:09:45.357
No, no, please don't go.
Don't go. Don't leave me.

01:09:45.448 --> 01:09:46.722
Okay. Go.

01:09:46.816 --> 01:09:47.988
It's okay. Hey...

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:51.120
I left everything. I don't
have any of my stuff.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.860
Taylor will get it.
It's fine, okay?

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:54.457
I'll take you home, come on.

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:57.130
And his pass has been cancelled?

01:09:57.660 --> 01:09:58.661
Good.

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.805
No. Thank you, Jerry.
Good night.

01:10:06.169 --> 01:10:08.046
Well, at least
that's dealt with.

01:10:08.204 --> 01:10:10.582
Hyde's out.
He's been fired.

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:11.674
Whoa.

01:10:14.210 --> 01:10:15.655
How? That's...

01:10:16.479 --> 01:10:20.222
But I thought your deal with
SIP hasn't been finished yet.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:23.186
It's not.
But I know the CEO.

01:10:24.353 --> 01:10:26.026
I told him what happened.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.496
You'll never have to
see him again.

01:10:29.692 --> 01:10:32.195
Am I still gonna have a job
now that he's not there?

01:10:32.829 --> 01:10:34.775
Well, if you don't,
you can just...

01:10:34.864 --> 01:10:37.606
Christian, you know
I love working.

01:10:38.201 --> 01:10:40.738
You can't keep me locked up
in your penthouse.

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.612
What if I gave you a key?

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:50.246
<i>I</i> mean,

01:10:50.379 --> 01:10:54.919
what if you had a key, and you
kept some of your stuff here?

01:10:55.084 --> 01:11:00.261
Keep all of your stuff here
and you slept, you know...

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:02.266
Not at your place.

01:11:04.861 --> 01:11:07.899
Are you asking me
to move in with you?

01:11:10.233 --> 01:11:11.234
Mmm-hmm.

01:11:13.703 --> 01:11:14.909
Are you sure?

01:11:15.204 --> 01:11:16.239
Yes.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.042
I want you here all the time.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.548
As soon as possible.

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:32.957
What happened to learning
to walk before we run?

01:11:34.457 --> 01:11:38.234
That's just one of the many things that
we could talk about over breakfast.

01:11:44.433 --> 01:11:45.776
Can I think about it?

01:11:46.569 --> 01:11:48.105
Sure.

01:11:48.404 --> 01:11:49.405
Yeah.

01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.419
Liz, hi!

01:11:59.582 --> 01:12:02.620
Ana, don't know if you heard,
but Jack resigned last night.

01:12:02.785 --> 01:12:03.786
In kind of a hurry.

01:12:03.953 --> 01:12:07.332
SIP isn't recruiting
right now, so we're screwed.

01:12:07.423 --> 01:12:09.369
So you don't need me
anymore then?

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.335
I'm gonna try to find you
something temporary.

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:13.930
Could you fill in for Jack
at this morning's meeting?

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:15.700
At the senior editors' meeting?

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.936
Just for today.

01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:18.959
You're the only one
who knows Jack's entire slate.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:21.140
Well, yeah, but, I...

01:12:24.607 --> 01:12:26.177
You're right.
It's too much.

01:12:29.145 --> 01:12:30.283
No, I can do it.

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:33.953
It's fine. I can do it.

01:12:35.318 --> 01:12:36.490
Great.

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:40.457
Call me when you're done.

01:12:43.292 --> 01:12:44.999
We need to print fewer titles.

01:12:45.161 --> 01:12:46.697
Stick with established authors.

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.672
Focus on our core readership.

01:12:48.831 --> 01:12:49.969
Expand it.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:52.034
I'm sorry.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:56.213
Um, uh... So, Ana, what do you
think we should be publishing?

01:12:59.075 --> 01:13:01.180
Um, newer voices.

01:13:01.310 --> 01:13:03.654
Along with your established authors.
Mmm-hmm.

01:13:03.813 --> 01:13:07.693
Boyce Fox, for example,
got 80,000 hits last week.

01:13:08.150 --> 01:13:09.150
Really?

01:13:09.185 --> 01:13:12.997
Online hits don't automatically
translate to print sales.

01:13:13.155 --> 01:13:15.499
Well, but they could.

01:13:15.658 --> 01:13:18.366
His online audience
is an 1840-24 demographic,

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:22.031
and those are exactly the readers
that we should be chasing.

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:26.537
Urn, I mean, lean show you the stats.
I think he's worth taking a risk on.

01:13:28.704 --> 01:13:30.547
Maybe we should take a look.

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.018
Great idea.

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:45.693
Uh, Ana? Ana, just...

01:13:45.855 --> 01:13:48.461
Mr. Roach, I'm really sorry
if I was out of line.

01:13:48.624 --> 01:13:50.695
No, don't be sorry.
You made a lot of sense.

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:54.870
No, so, uh, what are you doing
now that Jack Hyde's gone?

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:59.913
Um, well, Liz mentioned something
temporary. I don't know.

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:02.745
Okay. So why don't you
fill in for Jack temporarily?

01:14:03.539 --> 01:14:05.382
Good?
Um...

01:14:06.208 --> 01:14:08.415
Great. Okay.
That's settled.

01:14:59.261 --> 01:15:01.263
<i>To SIP's new fiction editor.</i>

01:15:01.430 --> 01:15:03.273
Acting fiction editor.

01:15:03.966 --> 01:15:05.809
Till they find out
how good you are.

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:11.008
Christian, did you have
something to do with this?

01:15:11.774 --> 01:15:14.948
No. Hey, it was all you.

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:18.686
What? You don't
believe me?

01:15:18.781 --> 01:15:20.954
I don't believe it myself.

01:15:25.321 --> 01:15:26.994
I asked you a question
last night.

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.336
About moving in with you?
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:35.331 --> 01:15:37.811
I just think that
I'm probably...

01:15:39.335 --> 01:15:42.578
I need to get some things
from my apartment.

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:46.684
That can be arranged.

01:15:48.144 --> 01:15:49.316
Good.

01:15:51.147 --> 01:15:53.354
Now, maybe we could

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:56.489
take this celebration home.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:00.490
The check, please.

01:16:10.833 --> 01:16:12.107
Take off your panties.

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:14.509
Do it now.

01:16:17.206 --> 01:16:18.241
Right in here?

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:20.342
Yeah, right here. Now.

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:22.515
Go on.

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:01.450
Hmm.

01:17:10.559 --> 01:17:11.629
Excuse me.

01:18:09.952 --> 01:18:10.953
Don't come.

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:46.929
Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. No.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.226
Two minutes.
Are you kidding?

01:18:50.326 --> 01:18:51.999
In the bedroom.
Are you joking?

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:53.567
Two minutes.

01:19:28.697 --> 01:19:30.040
What are you doing in here?

01:19:31.967 --> 01:19:33.446
You made me wait,

01:19:34.536 --> 01:19:35.981
so now it's your turn.

01:19:42.211 --> 01:19:43.554
Are you any good?

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:49.888
Hmm. We'll see.

01:19:52.388 --> 01:19:53.958
Maybe we should make a bet.

01:19:55.057 --> 01:19:56.661
If I win,

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:00.839
you take me to the red room.

01:20:02.464 --> 01:20:03.738
And if I win?

01:20:05.768 --> 01:20:06.940
Your choice.

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.688
Break.

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:25.927
Okay.

01:20:43.806 --> 01:20:45.183
Mmm. Solids.

01:21:38.494 --> 01:21:39.700
Oh, dear.

01:22:47.563 --> 01:22:49.065
Side pocket.

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.742
Red room, here we come.

01:22:59.641 --> 01:23:00.642
Oof.

01:23:00.742 --> 01:23:02.016
Shit.

01:23:02.911 --> 01:23:04.515
I hope you're not a sore loser.

01:23:06.949 --> 01:23:09.122
That depends on
how hard you spank me.

01:23:22.464 --> 01:23:24.341
I want to be
very rough with you.

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:26.606
So be rough with me.

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:57.842
And Jada needs someone
to sign off on the new Carusi.

01:23:58.800 --> 01:24:01.144
I kept asking Jack to do that.

01:24:01.303 --> 01:24:03.146
Yeah, well, Jack was
kind of lazy.

01:24:03.305 --> 01:24:04.511
Didn't you notice?

01:24:04.673 --> 01:24:05.811
Yeah.

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:08.318
I believe he called it
"artistic: Temperament."

01:24:11.847 --> 01:24:12.848
Thank you, Hannah.

01:24:13.682 --> 01:24:14.683
Yep.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:19.821
<i>Hey.</i>

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:22.732
It's great that
you're doing this, but...

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:25.930
It's totally weird,
I know. I know.

01:24:26.428 --> 01:24:29.204
I mean, am I expected
to call you Miss Steele?

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:31.843
I expect you to call me Ana.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.207
And I don't expect you
to fetch me coffee

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:36.772
unless you're getting
some for yourself.

01:24:38.941 --> 01:24:44.186
And the rest of it, we'll
just make up as we go, okay?

01:24:44.446 --> 01:24:45.618
Okay.

01:25:03.131 --> 01:25:04.269
Miss Steele.

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:09.241
Damn it.

01:25:10.238 --> 01:25:12.616
Take it. I'm just gonna grab
some stuff and check the mail.

01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:13.778
I should go up with you.

01:25:13.909 --> 01:25:15.411
No, it's okay.
I'll be two seconds.

01:25:15.644 --> 01:25:16.645
Take it.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:19.881
Hey, Ros.

01:26:01.623 --> 01:26:02.693
Leila.

01:26:07.696 --> 01:26:09.539
Christian is downstairs.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:12.034
Do you wanna see him?

01:26:15.837 --> 01:26:17.783
I came to see you.

01:26:21.109 --> 01:26:22.110
Okay.

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:27.387
He told me what happened.

01:26:31.453 --> 01:26:33.228
I know you're in a lot of pain.

01:26:35.057 --> 01:26:36.365
I'm so sorry.

01:26:37.459 --> 01:26:39.666
He lets you call him
by his name.

01:26:41.296 --> 01:26:44.300
He talks about you all the time.

01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:46.208
He cares about you.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:51.715
Don't lie.

01:26:55.343 --> 01:26:57.186
Tell me what you have
that I don't.

01:26:58.380 --> 01:26:59.723
Nothing.

01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:03.693
I'm nothing.

01:27:06.421 --> 01:27:07.729
He'll get tired of me.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:10.501
Master sleeps in your bed.

01:27:11.426 --> 01:27:13.838
How do you know that?
I saw you.

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:16.204
I watched you.

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:19.002
I know you love him.

01:27:19.434 --> 01:27:20.777
I do, too.

01:27:21.770 --> 01:27:22.908
We all do.

01:27:24.272 --> 01:27:25.512
Why don't you put the gun down?

01:27:25.607 --> 01:27:28.281
You don't know him
or what he likes.

01:27:28.443 --> 01:27:30.763
You don't give him what he wants.
He's pretending with you.

01:27:45.360 --> 01:27:46.464
No, Christian.

01:28:08.984 --> 01:28:09.985
Kneel.

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:30.510
Ana...

01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:33.916
Go to Escala.
Wait for me there.

01:28:37.512 --> 01:28:40.356
For once, just do
as you're told.

01:28:45.187 --> 01:28:47.098
Taylor, get her out of here.

01:29:00.502 --> 01:29:01.708
Miss Steele.

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:10.111
Miss Steele. Ana!

01:29:10.278 --> 01:29:11.655
Stop it, Taylor.

01:30:39.935 --> 01:30:41.414
I don't care.

01:30:42.537 --> 01:30:46.781
She's been gone for three hours, and she
doesn't have her cell or her purse.

01:30:50.779 --> 01:30:52.258
Forget it. She's here.

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.729
Where the fuck have you been?

01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:03.667
I told you to come
straight here.

01:31:03.825 --> 01:31:06.066
I've had people out combing
the streets, looking for you.

01:31:06.127 --> 01:31:08.733
I'm sorry I don't always
do as I'm told.

01:31:09.331 --> 01:31:13.108
Maybe you just really need
someone who obeys every command.

01:31:13.268 --> 01:31:14.508
Don't be ridiculous.

01:31:14.669 --> 01:31:16.273
I saw you, Christian.

01:31:16.438 --> 01:31:18.577
I saw the way
you were with Leila.

01:31:18.740 --> 01:31:20.583
She had a gun, Ana.

01:31:21.076 --> 01:31:22.749
I would have done
anything to subdue her.

01:31:24.612 --> 01:31:26.250
Where is she now?

01:31:27.148 --> 01:31:28.149
Is she here?

01:31:28.249 --> 01:31:29.353
What?

01:31:29.517 --> 01:31:30.928
No, of course not.

01:31:31.086 --> 01:31:33.430
She's in the psych ward getting
the help that she needs.

01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:38.938
Look, I know she scared you...

01:31:39.094 --> 01:31:40.801
Yeah. She scared me.

01:31:42.297 --> 01:31:44.538
But you scared me more.

01:31:45.467 --> 01:31:47.845
Seeing you like that with her'

01:31:48.003 --> 01:31:53.851
I'll never be able to give you that
kind of submission and obedience.

01:31:54.309 --> 01:31:55.310
Ana.

01:31:55.810 --> 01:31:58.620
Don't crowd me.
I need space.

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.557
No, please don't do this.
Christian.

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:03.629
Don't give up on me. I just
need to think a little bit.

01:32:04.185 --> 01:32:05.994
Don't leave me.

01:32:09.391 --> 01:32:11.029
What are you doing?

01:32:12.394 --> 01:32:13.566
Get up.

01:32:16.965 --> 01:32:18.501
What are you doing?

01:32:19.134 --> 01:32:20.374
Look at me.

01:32:22.303 --> 01:32:23.509
Look at me.

01:32:30.345 --> 01:32:31.688
I'm scared.

01:32:36.484 --> 01:32:38.896
I know you say that I'm enough.

01:32:42.090 --> 01:32:44.866
But there are certain things
that you are used to getting

01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:49.198
that I will never, ever,
ever be able to give you.

01:32:51.533 --> 01:32:55.071
And it might be fine
for right now,

01:32:55.837 --> 01:32:58.249
but what's gonna happen when
you start needing them again?

01:32:58.339 --> 01:32:59.340
I won't.

01:32:59.507 --> 01:33:01.111
How do you know that?

01:33:01.276 --> 01:33:02.346
How can I believe you?

01:33:02.510 --> 01:33:04.547
I don't even understand
your need to dominate.

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:06.455
I'm not a Dominant.

01:33:07.182 --> 01:33:08.388
I'm not.

01:33:09.384 --> 01:33:11.386
The right term is a sadist.

01:33:12.754 --> 01:33:15.394
I get off on punishing women.
Women who look like you...

01:33:15.457 --> 01:33:17.130
Like your mother.

01:33:18.760 --> 01:33:19.761
Yes.

01:33:20.595 --> 01:33:22.871
And I know
how fucked up that is.

01:33:23.898 --> 01:33:25.241
When you left,

01:33:26.134 --> 01:33:30.549
I swore that I would stop it if
that's what it took to get you back.

01:33:31.806 --> 01:33:33.717
But I'm done with it.

01:33:34.709 --> 01:33:37.656
You mean more to me
than anything else.

01:33:40.748 --> 01:33:43.786
I wanna
believe you. I do.

01:33:43.885 --> 01:33:45.125
But I can't.

01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:46.756
Ana, give me your hand.

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:52.001
This is me.

01:33:53.895 --> 01:33:55.135
All of me.

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:57.298
Christian.

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.172
And I'm all yours.

01:35:01.563 --> 01:35:02.564
No.

01:35:06.401 --> 01:35:07.402
No!

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:11.382
Hey. Hey, hey.
No.

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:13.519
It's okay.
I'm right here.

01:35:14.342 --> 01:35:15.821
I'm right here.

01:35:21.049 --> 01:35:22.153
Marry me.

01:35:24.152 --> 01:35:25.152
What?

01:35:25.186 --> 01:35:26.927
I want you to marry me.

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:32.436
Christian, I think
you're dreaming.

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:37.796
Good morning.

01:36:38.293 --> 01:36:39.328
Morning.

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:44.303
Sleep okay?

01:36:45.066 --> 01:36:47.012
I did. You?

01:36:47.435 --> 01:36:49.847
Like a log.
Out all night.

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:50.938
Hmm.

01:36:54.409 --> 01:36:59.518
You didn't have any
weird dreams or anything?

01:37:00.348 --> 01:37:02.294
Or, like, wake up at all?

01:37:02.450 --> 01:37:03.451
No.

01:37:04.319 --> 01:37:05.821
I mean,
none that I can think of.

01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:06.921
Hmm.

01:37:07.855 --> 01:37:10.426
I mean, there was a little thing
of asking you to marry me,

01:37:10.491 --> 01:37:12.368
but aside from that, no.
Nothing.

01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:14.531
Don't mess with me like that.

01:37:14.696 --> 01:37:17.609
No? How should I
mess with you?

01:37:18.132 --> 01:37:20.043
Like this? Huh?

01:37:21.202 --> 01:37:22.374
Is that better?

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:28.981
I meant it.

01:37:30.611 --> 01:37:32.386
I wanna marry you.

01:37:33.381 --> 01:37:34.485
Why?

01:37:35.983 --> 01:37:40.489
Because I wanna spend every second
of the rest of my life with you.

01:37:47.662 --> 01:37:50.506
I don't expect you
to say yes right away.

01:37:51.666 --> 01:37:53.009
I know I'm complicated.

01:37:55.336 --> 01:37:58.010
Just a little bit.

01:38:01.909 --> 01:38:03.320
You have an assistant?

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:05.085
I thought you were an assistant.

01:38:06.381 --> 01:38:08.588
It's a long story.
What's going on?

01:38:08.683 --> 01:38:11.027
<i>What do I get Christian
for his birthday?</i>

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:14.723
The boy already has everything
except a sense of humor.

01:38:14.856 --> 01:38:15.857
Uh...

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:19.201
His birthday?
When is his birthday?

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:22.204
<i>Sunday. He didn't tell you?
He is so weird.</i>

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:24.203
Mom and Dad
are throwing him a party.

01:38:24.365 --> 01:38:25.605
Didn't they just have a party?

01:38:25.767 --> 01:38:27.542
Jeez, you're <i>as bad</i> as he is.

01:38:27.702 --> 01:38:28.703
That was a ball.

01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:31.714
This is just family, friends,
music, fireworks.

01:38:31.873 --> 01:38:34.285
No biggie.
Hey, what about a tie?

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:36.116
Uh, uh...

01:38:36.210 --> 01:38:38.053
Christian has a lot of ties.

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:40.556
<i>Socks, suspenders? Throw me a bone here?</i>

01:38:40.615 --> 01:38:41.616
Um, oh...

01:38:41.716 --> 01:38:43.252
God, Mia, I gotta go.

01:38:43.418 --> 01:38:47.059
Okay, okay. But Sunday, or I'll
hunt you down myself. Bye.

01:38:49.690 --> 01:38:51.636
Ooh, perfect.

01:38:59.734 --> 01:39:00.906
Do you have a gift box?

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.038
One second.

01:39:05.973 --> 01:39:06.974
Hey.

01:39:14.081 --> 01:39:15.583
Miss Steele.
Hmm.

01:39:15.650 --> 01:39:16.754
How was your day?

01:39:17.218 --> 01:39:19.164
Looking up, Mr. Grey.

01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:20.560
Where's Taylor?

01:39:20.721 --> 01:39:22.598
He went to get my bag.

01:39:22.757 --> 01:39:24.930
Your bag?
Where are you going?

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:27.936
Ros and I have to go to
Portland for some meetings.

01:39:28.095 --> 01:39:29.438
I'll be back tomorrow night.

01:39:30.398 --> 01:39:31.570
Come on.

01:39:32.767 --> 01:39:35.179
When were you going to tell
me about your birthday?

01:39:37.405 --> 01:39:40.249
Your parents are
throwing you a party.

01:39:40.408 --> 01:39:42.115
Were we just gonna stay home?

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.787
They do this every year.

01:39:44.846 --> 01:39:46.257
Um, yeah. Birthday.

01:39:48.416 --> 01:39:52.626
My, uh, arrival in the world isn't
something I feel like celebrating.

01:39:53.287 --> 01:39:55.858
Well, I feel like
celebrating it.

01:39:58.259 --> 01:40:00.296
Can't open it
till the day though.

01:40:02.296 --> 01:40:03.866
Then why give it to me now?

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:07.642
Cali it delayed gratification.

01:41:12.667 --> 01:41:15.614
Is that...
ls that Mount St. Helens?

01:41:17.204 --> 01:41:19.775
I changed the flight plan,
get us home sooner.

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:24.614
Great. You realize
that's a volcano, right?

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:28.252
Relax, Ros. If it goes up,
you'll have a ringside seat.

01:41:28.349 --> 01:41:29.350
Ah.

01:41:29.884 --> 01:41:31.295
Lucky me.

01:41:42.396 --> 01:41:43.602
Christian, what is that?

01:41:43.698 --> 01:41:44.802
Don't worry.

01:41:48.903 --> 01:41:50.712
Oh, my God! Christian!

01:41:51.706 --> 01:41:52.741
Shit.

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.281
Shit. Christian,
what is going on?

01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:01.621
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!
What is happening?

01:42:04.385 --> 01:42:05.557
Damn it.
Oh, my God.

01:42:06.220 --> 01:42:07.426
Oh, my God, Christian!

01:42:14.295 --> 01:42:15.399
Stop it!

01:42:28.976 --> 01:42:30.284
Christian!

01:42:41.022 --> 01:42:42.342
There.
There, there, there, there!

01:43:09.050 --> 01:43:10.222
Oh, you remember this guy?

01:43:10.384 --> 01:43:11.488
Kate!

01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:16.390
Hi!

01:43:16.490 --> 01:43:20.131
Oh, my God!
You're so tan and glowy.

01:43:20.327 --> 01:43:21.397
You want a beer, Ana?

01:43:21.562 --> 01:43:23.007
Yes! Please. Please.

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:24.532
Hi, José.
Hey.

01:43:24.699 --> 01:43:26.701
Hi! How's it going?

01:43:26.867 --> 01:43:29.711
So? Congratulations,
Fiction Editor.

01:43:29.870 --> 01:43:31.850
Right?
She's a big deal now.

01:43:32.006 --> 01:43:33.815
And how's, uh, your hottie?

01:43:34.675 --> 01:43:36.518
Uh, Christian is good.

01:43:36.577 --> 01:43:38.022
Um, uh...

01:43:38.079 --> 01:43:39.581
He asked me to move in with him.

01:43:40.681 --> 01:43:41.819
What?

01:43:41.982 --> 01:43:43.518
Ana's moving in with Christian.

01:43:43.584 --> 01:43:44.722
Oh, that's great.

01:43:44.885 --> 01:43:46.990
You know, we could
use the privacy.

01:43:47.588 --> 01:43:49.932
He's so subtle, it kills me.

01:43:50.091 --> 01:43:51.161
Stop.

01:43:52.393 --> 01:43:54.896
So you're serious. But are you happy?

01:43:54.995 --> 01:43:56.440
'Cause that's all I care about.

01:43:56.597 --> 01:43:59.942
I mean, it's complicated,
but I've never been happier.

01:44:00.067 --> 01:44:01.068
Hey, Mia, what's up?

01:44:01.869 --> 01:44:05.248
Did you hear about José's show?
It was incredible.

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:06.749
Really. He was amazing.

01:44:06.907 --> 01:44:08.547
He got rave reviews.
I gotta check it oui.

01:44:08.709 --> 01:44:10.620
Wait, wait, Mia.
Slow down.

01:44:11.846 --> 01:44:14.520
Shit. Okay. Yeah, yeah,
we're on our way.

01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:19.195
Um, Christian's chopper went missing
on the way back from Portland.

01:44:19.353 --> 01:44:21.594
They're sending out
search parties right now.

01:44:22.456 --> 01:44:24.094
Come on, let's go.

01:44:24.458 --> 01:44:26.837
<i>For more on this breaking
story, Rat's go out to the field</i>

01:44:26.861 --> 01:44:28.534
<i>and our reporter, Rachel Taylor.</i>

01:44:28.696 --> 01:44:30.403
<i>Rachel'!
Thank you, John.</i>

01:44:30.564 --> 01:44:33.704
<i>I'm speaking to you five from the private
helicopter terminal at Seattle...</i>

01:44:33.768 --> 01:44:37.306
They'll find him. He'll be okay.
It's Christian.

01:44:38.372 --> 01:44:41.376
<i>The helicopter was
an Airbus helicopter H-130.,.</i>

01:44:41.542 --> 01:44:42.987
Is there anything we can do?

01:44:44.145 --> 01:44:46.455
<i>And Christian Grey,
although only 27 years old,</i>

01:44:46.547 --> 01:44:47.758
<i>had extensive flying experience.</i>

01:44:47.782 --> 01:44:48.783
All right' bye.

01:44:48.883 --> 01:44:50.453
<i>One of Seattle's youngest
billionaires,</i>

01:44:50.551 --> 01:44:53.794

<i>a multinational

01:44:55.723 --> 01:44:57.498
Jesus! Will someone
shut them up?

01:44:57.658 --> 01:45:00.332
No, please. Leave it on.

01:45:00.561 --> 01:45:01.972
Just turn it down please, José.

01:45:02.563 --> 01:45:03.974
Thank you.

01:45:04.165 --> 01:45:06.907
You're shivering. I'll
get you a sweater, okay?

01:45:12.807 --> 01:45:14.582
Ana. Tea.

01:45:19.580 --> 01:45:21.025
He's gonna be fine.

01:45:21.916 --> 01:45:23.452
He has to be okay.

01:45:26.754 --> 01:45:28.665
We haven't had any time.

01:45:30.124 --> 01:45:32.468
We need to have more time.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:35.800
You're going to have
plenty of time.

01:45:37.932 --> 01:45:40.208
We're so glad that
you're here with us

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:42.275
and in Christian's life.

01:45:43.871 --> 01:45:46.875
You've made such
a difference to him.

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:55.024
He never let anyone get
close until you came along.

01:45:57.518 --> 01:45:59.464
Grace, he adores you.

01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.624
I know,

01:46:00.688 --> 01:46:05.296
but children grow apart from
their parents, and that's fine,

01:46:05.459 --> 01:46:07.405
as long as they're happy.

01:46:08.128 --> 01:46:13.407
And he is happy with you.

01:46:15.002 --> 01:46:16.811
And that's all I ever wanted.

01:46:17.404 --> 01:46:18.648
Turn it up.

01:46:18.672 --> 01:46:23.587
<i>Christian Grey and his colleague
Ros Bailey have been found safe and wen'</i>

01:46:23.711 --> 01:46:26.419
<i>and are, at this moment,
on their way back in Seattle.</i>

01:46:28.315 --> 01:46:30.022
What the hell
are you all doing here?

01:46:30.184 --> 01:46:31.925
Christian?
Oh, my God!

01:46:32.887 --> 01:46:34.889
Christian!
How did you get here?

01:46:35.422 --> 01:46:36.594
Later, Mia.

01:46:37.091 --> 01:46:39.765
What happened? Oh, my God!
Why didn't you call?

01:46:39.927 --> 01:46:41.727
I had an accident.
I lost my phone.

01:46:41.762 --> 01:46:43.708
We know.
It's been all over the news.

01:46:43.764 --> 01:46:45.607
I'm fine.
Ros is fine.

01:46:45.699 --> 01:46:48.737
Dad, he's here.
He just walked in.

01:46:48.869 --> 01:46:51.076
I'm okay. He looks like shit,
but he's in one piece.

01:46:51.171 --> 01:46:52.946
- No, he doesn't.
- Yeah, he does.

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.510
Guys, relax. I'm fine.

01:46:54.575 --> 01:46:55.747
Come here, man.

01:46:57.411 --> 01:46:59.084
Okay. Need to say hi to my girl.

01:46:59.179 --> 01:47:00.180
Come on, Mom.

01:47:03.517 --> 01:47:04.928
- I need a drink.
- Me, too.

01:47:04.952 --> 01:47:06.090
Miss me?

01:47:17.598 --> 01:47:18.633
Oh, my God.

01:47:22.036 --> 01:47:24.710
I thought...
Hey, hey, Ana...

01:47:24.772 --> 01:47:27.548
It's all right.
Ana, I'm here.

01:47:27.708 --> 01:47:31.053
I was so scared.
I was so scared.

01:47:35.382 --> 01:47:37.157
I thought I lost you forever.

01:47:38.085 --> 01:47:39.723
Not a chance.

01:47:40.721 --> 01:47:41.722
I'm here.

01:47:46.660 --> 01:47:48.606
That's when
all my instruments lit up.

01:47:49.330 --> 01:47:52.334
- Had a fire in the tail, lost both engines.
- Both of them?

01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:55.402
Yeah. Thank you.

01:47:57.738 --> 01:48:00.685
I tried to find somewhere safe
to land, but it was all trees.

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:04.984
We hit them pretty hard, but luckily we
were both able to crawl out of there.

01:48:05.412 --> 01:48:07.119
Thank goodness.

01:48:08.782 --> 01:48:10.125
Thank God.

01:48:12.786 --> 01:48:14.595
Sorry, guys, but
I gotta take off.

01:48:15.522 --> 01:48:16.762
Okay.

01:48:17.958 --> 01:48:21.838
José, thanks for being here.
Means the world to Ana.

01:48:21.929 --> 01:48:24.102
Of course.
Hey...

01:48:24.598 --> 01:48:27.044
Welcome home, Mr. Grey.
Christian, please.

01:48:28.535 --> 01:48:31.778
Well, it's late, and these
two should get some rest.

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:33.947
Grace, shall we'?
Yes.

01:48:34.008 --> 01:48:35.518
Yeah, I think we're gonna
head home too, bro.

01:48:35.542 --> 01:48:36.646
Cool.

01:48:36.710 --> 01:48:38.383
We'll walk you guy's.

01:48:40.614 --> 01:48:44.118
Kinda hate to say this, but your guy's
all right.

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:47.290
I'm glad he's okay,
and I'm glad you're happy.

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:51.032
Thank you. Will we be seeing
you tomorrow at his party?

01:48:51.125 --> 01:48:53.071
Don't push it.

01:48:56.497 --> 01:48:57.567
Come here.

01:48:59.833 --> 01:49:00.903
Careful.

01:49:01.068 --> 01:49:02.513
I know.

01:49:02.669 --> 01:49:04.478
Mom.
Okay.

01:49:07.374 --> 01:49:08.494
We'll see you tomorrow, Ana.

01:49:08.642 --> 01:49:09.643
Good night.

01:49:16.417 --> 01:49:17.691
It's after midnight.

01:49:18.719 --> 01:49:20.357
I'm not tired.

01:49:20.521 --> 01:49:21.591
No.

01:49:22.489 --> 01:49:23.729
It's your birthday.

01:49:26.427 --> 01:49:27.838
Yeah.

01:49:29.730 --> 01:49:31.004
Happy birthday.

01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:33.003
Thank you.

01:49:36.170 --> 01:49:38.616
Do you still have
that gift I gave you?

01:49:40.774 --> 01:49:41.775
Yes.

01:49:53.387 --> 01:49:55.264
You know you didn't have to.

01:49:56.223 --> 01:49:57.566
All I want is you.

01:49:57.724 --> 01:49:59.397
Just open it.

01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:00.795
Okay.

01:50:07.401 --> 01:50:08.880
Keychain.

01:50:09.036 --> 01:50:10.777
Turn it over.

01:50:20.614 --> 01:50:22.651
Does this mean yes, yes?

01:50:22.816 --> 01:50:23.988
Yes.

01:50:24.718 --> 01:50:25.992
Yes, yes, yes.

01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:34.332
Wait!

01:50:35.596 --> 01:50:37.735
So this whole time I had
the answer in my pocket?

01:50:40.901 --> 01:50:42.471
Anastasia Steele...

01:50:42.803 --> 01:50:44.942
What am I gonna do with you?

01:51:16.637 --> 01:51:18.548
Take me to the red room.

01:51:18.705 --> 01:51:19.843
Take me...

01:51:20.007 --> 01:51:21.384
Take me to the red room.

01:51:22.142 --> 01:51:23.519
Are you sure?
Yes.

01:51:24.611 --> 01:51:25.612
Yes.

01:54:01.468 --> 01:54:02.845
I love you.

01:54:10.377 --> 01:54:11.879
Well, I love you.

01:54:13.347 --> 01:54:16.157
Hello?
Mom? Hi.

01:54:16.717 --> 01:54:20.290
Ana, sweetheart.
Where have you been?

01:54:21.121 --> 01:54:25.194
I know. I've been... I'm sorry.
Work has been so crazy.

01:54:25.625 --> 01:54:27.502
I hope they're not
overworking you?

01:54:27.861 --> 01:54:31.206
No, no. It's actually...
It's going really well.

01:54:31.998 --> 01:54:37.311
Urn, but I was calling because I, um... I
wanted to talk to you about Christian.

01:54:37.804 --> 01:54:40.182
Christian?
You've heard from him?

01:54:40.407 --> 01:54:43.513
Yeah. We got back together.

01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:50.150
Honey, that's wonderful! This time
it's going to last. I know it is.

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:54.158
I hope you're right,
because, urn...

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:59.232
He asked me to marry him,
and I said yes.

01:55:05.232 --> 01:55:06.336
Mom?

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.181
You're not...
No, no, I'm not pregnant.

01:55:11.004 --> 01:55:12.005
Um...

01:55:13.840 --> 01:55:16.514
I know that we haven't
been together very long,

01:55:20.113 --> 01:55:22.354
but I love him so much.

01:55:25.352 --> 01:55:26.888
He's the one.

01:55:27.087 --> 01:55:30.557
Oh, sweetheart!
I'm so happy for you!

01:55:30.791 --> 01:55:32.930
<i>You are?
Of course.</i>

01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:35.563
You've always
known your own mind.

01:55:35.629 --> 01:55:39.702
If that man is the love of your
life, you grab him with both hands.

01:55:41.535 --> 01:55:42.912
Thanks, Mama.

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:46.381
Have you called Ray?
Um, no, not yet.

01:55:46.773 --> 01:55:50.778
Um... Christian did, though.
He asked for his permission.

01:55:50.877 --> 01:55:55.155
He asked for your hand?
That's so chivalrous.

01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:21.641
Hey.

01:56:22.476 --> 01:56:23.477
Hey.

01:56:23.844 --> 01:56:24.914
Champagne, Mr. Grey?

01:56:25.078 --> 01:56:26.318
Thanks, Gretchen.

01:56:26.480 --> 01:56:29.518
And can I just say,
happy birthday?

01:56:30.016 --> 01:56:31.757
Sure. Thank you.

01:56:35.155 --> 01:56:36.828
Christian.
Mom.

01:56:37.591 --> 01:56:38.968
Happy birthday.
Thank you.

01:56:40.327 --> 01:56:41.431
And Ana.
Hi.

01:56:41.495 --> 01:56:43.338
It's so good to see you again.

01:56:43.497 --> 01:56:45.943
You saw us last night.

01:56:45.999 --> 01:56:47.000
Yes.

01:56:47.167 --> 01:56:48.441
And because of that

01:56:48.602 --> 01:56:52.311
lam never taking anything for granted.
Ever again.

01:56:52.606 --> 01:56:53.812
Hey!

01:56:53.974 --> 01:56:55.885
I heard about the crash.
Are you okay?

01:56:55.976 --> 01:56:57.717
I'm fine, Elena.
Thank you.

01:56:57.811 --> 01:56:59.188
Oh!

01:56:59.279 --> 01:57:02.988
Ana, let me introduce to you,
my good friend, Elena Lincoln.

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:05.060
We met at the masquerade.

01:57:05.218 --> 01:57:07.562
Yes.
Nice to see you again.

01:57:09.789 --> 01:57:10.790
Excuse us.

01:57:10.957 --> 01:57:11.992
Surely.

01:57:12.826 --> 01:57:14.066
She's fantastic.

01:57:22.502 --> 01:57:24.140
Ladies, gentlemen. Mia.

01:57:26.573 --> 01:57:29.645
I wanna thank you all
for coming here this evening.

01:57:29.809 --> 01:57:31.409
I was expecting
a small family gathering.

01:57:31.478 --> 01:57:32.752
Thanks, Mia.

01:57:33.213 --> 01:57:34.533
But I'm happy
that you're all here

01:57:34.581 --> 01:57:36.993
because I have
an announcement to make.

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:42.364
As most of you know, yesterday
Ros and I had a narrow escape.

01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:47.403
And something like that reminds
us of what really matters

01:57:47.561 --> 01:57:49.939
and how important it is
to seize the day.

01:57:50.997 --> 01:57:54.444
We should cherish the people we
care about and who care about us.

01:57:55.769 --> 01:58:01.344
Mom, Dad, I know I haven't
always been the perfect son.

01:58:02.375 --> 01:58:05.720
But I owe everything
to you both, so thank you.

01:58:12.619 --> 01:58:14.223
But that's not the announcement.

01:58:14.588 --> 01:58:17.694
Ana, come up here
a second, please.

01:58:27.767 --> 01:58:31.408
So, a while ago, I was lucky enough
to meet this amazing young woman,

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:33.141
Anastasia Steele.

01:58:33.573 --> 01:58:36.417
And very quickly, I realized
that she was the one

01:58:36.476 --> 01:58:37.921
I wanted to share my life with.

01:58:38.745 --> 01:58:42.750
So I asked her to marry
me, and she said yes.

01:58:43.550 --> 01:58:45.962
Oh! That is so...

01:58:57.130 --> 01:58:58.768
lam thrilled, Ana.

01:58:59.766 --> 01:59:01.744
- Welcome to the family.
- Thank you.

01:59:01.768 --> 01:59:04.977
If I cry any more, I'm
just going to dehydrate.

01:59:05.138 --> 01:59:06.515
Oh, my God!
Don't do that.

01:59:06.673 --> 01:59:07.777
Congratulations.

01:59:07.941 --> 01:59:09.079
Stop crying, Mom.

01:59:09.242 --> 01:59:10.778
Can't help it.
I love you so much.

01:59:10.944 --> 01:59:12.150
I love you.

01:59:12.746 --> 01:59:15.283
Hi! Well done,
big brother!

01:59:16.483 --> 01:59:18.156
Ring! Show me the ring.

01:59:18.985 --> 01:59:20.362
Oh, we're gonna
choose it together.

01:59:20.520 --> 01:59:23.160
No rock.
Christian Grey.

01:59:23.623 --> 01:59:25.762
Oh, my God!
I have a sister!

01:59:38.505 --> 01:59:41.281
I leave you alone for a couple
weeks, and this is what happens?

01:59:41.341 --> 01:59:43.844
I know! I'm sorry
I didn't tell you.

01:59:44.010 --> 01:59:45.512
Oh, please. Come here.

01:59:46.179 --> 01:59:48.284
Oh!

01:59:48.515 --> 01:59:52.156
So, how does it feel to bag
Seattle's most eligible bachelor?

01:59:52.318 --> 01:59:54.195
It's a little scary, but...

01:59:54.354 --> 01:59:56.391
Well, if anyone can
make it work, it's you.

01:59:57.023 --> 01:59:58.866
Hey, sis-in-law!

01:59:59.693 --> 02:00:02.572
Congratulations. Christian's
a very lucky guy.

02:00:03.329 --> 02:00:06.799
You, however, are certifiably insane.

02:00:06.866 --> 02:00:08.038
I'm sorry to interrupt

02:00:08.201 --> 02:00:10.081
Mia wants to taste one of
your killer cocktails.

02:00:10.203 --> 02:00:12.205
Oh, well, coming right up.

02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:16.577
I see you heeded
our little talk.

02:00:22.182 --> 02:00:24.389
What makes you think
I would ever listen to you?

02:00:24.551 --> 02:00:26.553
You don't care about Christian.

02:00:26.720 --> 02:00:27.892
He'll see that.

02:00:28.054 --> 02:00:29.533
I'll make sure of it.

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:31.566
He'll see right through you.

02:00:32.726 --> 02:00:34.603
It's over for you, Elena.

02:00:34.894 --> 02:00:37.932
You're just a mousy little
thing after his money.

02:00:38.098 --> 02:00:40.408
He's not capable of marriage.

02:00:47.240 --> 02:00:48.583
Thank you, Christian.

02:00:49.075 --> 02:00:50.782
Why are you even here, Elena?

02:00:51.778 --> 02:00:53.257
She's not right for you.

02:00:53.413 --> 02:00:55.256
You don't know
what's right for me.

02:00:55.415 --> 02:00:57.452
You taught me
how to fuck, Elena.

02:00:57.617 --> 02:00:59.096
Ana taught me how to love.

02:00:59.252 --> 02:01:01.926
She's just the next one in line.

02:01:02.555 --> 02:01:04.262
Get out of my house.

02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:12.071
Leave my children alone, and
get the hell out of my house.

02:01:24.811 --> 02:01:26.290
Ana, darling...

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:31.656
Would you give us
a moment alone' please?

02:02:00.847 --> 02:02:01.985
I'm sorry about that
