00:03:40.353 --> 00:03:41.525
Poor Jacobson.

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:45.669
He took his stapler,
how pitiful is that.

00:03:45.826 --> 00:03:48.898
Still, you got to hand it to him...
He went for it.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:50.405
That was his big mistake.

00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:52.407
Always stay
in the middle of the pack.

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.739
It's the frontrunners
who fall off the cliff.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:58.007
At least Jacobson made it up
on the seventh floor.

00:03:58.171 --> 00:04:00.549
It smells
like cabbage on this floor!

00:04:00.707 --> 00:04:02.618
That's the smell of dead dreams.

00:04:02.776 --> 00:04:04.517
I go to the clubs at night
and people are like,

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:07.352
"Hey, who's wearing the coleslaw?"

00:04:07.514 --> 00:04:10.961
Do you know how hard it is to get laid
when you smell like coleslaw?

00:04:11.118 --> 00:04:14.031
NO! hard, but Still.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:15.962
He had a pretty sweet office.

00:04:16.123 --> 00:04:17.363
I wonder who's gonna get it?

00:04:17.524 --> 00:04:19.765
You wonder who�s gonna
get his office?

00:04:19.926 --> 00:04:22.532
Jesus, Josh,
why don't you show a little class?

00:04:22.696 --> 00:04:24.039
The guy just got fired.

00:04:28.702 --> 00:04:31.114
- I�m gonna get that office.
- You�d better, Tim.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:34.980
You need that job. With that car
you�re driving and that apartment,

00:04:35.142 --> 00:04:36.212
You're overextended.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:38.652
These opportunities
don't come along all the time.

00:04:38.812 --> 00:04:42.282
Right now, the window's open
and if you hesitate, bam!

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:46.226
You're gonna be my assistant.
Assistant to an assistant.

00:04:46.386 --> 00:04:49.492
You can't go lower.
It's a shitty job, Tim.

00:04:49.656 --> 00:04:51.727
Do you think Julie's
gonna marry you then?

00:04:53.927 --> 00:04:56.464
Don't mess this up.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:00.442
- Good pep talk.
- All right. Go, team!

00:05:21.154 --> 00:05:24.260
The whole reason we bought
the plant was to shut the factory,

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:26.597
shed the workforce
and sell the equipment.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.866
But now, it's all contaminated
with low-level radiation.

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.600
Nobody wants to touch it.

00:05:31.765 --> 00:05:35.269
Americans are
so uptight about radiation.

00:05:35.435 --> 00:05:38.712
They are. But the Russians
are a little less particular

00:05:38.872 --> 00:05:39.942
about this sort of thing.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:42.279
I like it. Get two bids.
Drive up the price.

00:05:42.442 --> 00:05:45.116
- OK, that makes sense.
- On a different note, you'll notice

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:48.953
that our colleague, Doug Jacobson,
has been relieved of his duties.

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:54.121
Mr. Jacobson led us right to the edge,
playing around in the currency markets.

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:57.131
As a consequence,
tomorrow morning, I want ten ideas

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.133
to make up for his mistakes.

00:06:02.562 --> 00:06:05.975
- What are you doing?
- I have an idea.

00:06:06.733 --> 00:06:08.713
An analyst...

00:06:08.869 --> 00:06:10.746
...has an idea.
OK, then.

00:06:10.904 --> 00:06:12.713
Nice knowing you, buddy.

00:06:12.873 --> 00:06:16.844
Sixth floor, stepping up. Nice!

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:20.922
- Whoa!
- it's all right. It's dead.

00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:25.257
It's manufactured by Mueller Armaments,
from Zurich, Switzerland.

00:06:25.418 --> 00:06:28.331
It's a company that made
a fortune during World War I.

00:06:28.488 --> 00:06:30.365
Now they're sitting
on a bunch of bombs

00:06:30.523 --> 00:06:31.900
that even the worst armies
in the world don't want.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.060
All right,
so we cannibalize the company.

00:06:34.227 --> 00:06:35.831
Who's gonna buy the pieces?

00:06:35.996 --> 00:06:38.533
Oh, no, we're not gonna
strip this one down.

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:46.514
Wow. Novelty lamps. Great idea.

00:06:46.673 --> 00:06:49.586
We could literally make
hundreds of dollars. Hundreds.

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.622
Who cares about lamps?

00:06:52.779 --> 00:06:54.417
Martin Mueller does.

00:06:56.016 --> 00:06:59.293
When Martin isn�t busy running
his family�s business into the ground,

00:06:59.452 --> 00:07:02.695
he's either yachting
or buying art for his castle.

00:07:02.856 --> 00:07:06.201
The business is going under,
but his personal fortune is vast.

00:07:06.359 --> 00:07:08.032
Nearly half a billion.

00:07:08.194 --> 00:07:13.041
I heard he was in town,
so I sent a prototype over to his hotel.

00:07:14.301 --> 00:07:16.713
He loved the lamps.

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:18.816
He wants to sit down.

00:07:18.972 --> 00:07:21.646
The lamps are really just a way
to get our foot in the door.

00:07:21.808 --> 00:07:22.980
We're gonna lose money on them.

00:07:23.143 --> 00:07:26.556
But we'll make millions
managing his personal portfolio.

00:07:26.713 --> 00:07:30.559
Mueller keeps his business.
We've got a brand-new client.

00:07:30.717 --> 00:07:35.223
- Everybody wins.
- Everybody wins. That's a new one.

00:07:35.388 --> 00:07:36.731
Caldwell, you want to lake
the lead on this?

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:38.460
- Absolutely.
- I'll ride shotgun.

00:07:38.625 --> 00:07:40.298
Actually, I was hoping
I could take the lead.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.666
Oh...

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:47.678
Uh, let me think... no.

00:07:53.907 --> 00:07:56.080
You should've quit
while you were ahead, buddy.

00:07:57.677 --> 00:08:00.658
You know what they say".
tallest tree gets chopped down first.

00:08:00.814 --> 00:08:03.852
- That went well.
- Mr. Conrad?

00:08:06.252 --> 00:08:08.289
Have you got a second?

00:08:15.996 --> 00:08:17.270
Come in!

00:08:18.498 --> 00:08:21.445
You can just set your
bombs by the door,

00:08:23.436 --> 00:08:27.714
You put on quite a show
in there. Sit down,

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.459
Oh, that looks good on him,
right?

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:39.529
Yep. Better than it did on Jacobson.
You're gonna need a nicer watch.

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:41.962
Nicer watch, nicer suit.

00:08:42.122 --> 00:08:44.568
Hey, to the ballsiest guy
on the sixth floor, huh?

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:46.635
Not gonna be
on the sixth floor for long.

00:08:48.495 --> 00:08:50.805
Does that mean
this is my new office?

00:08:50.964 --> 00:08:54.377
Not yet. No, I wan! to get
to know you a little better.

00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:57.378
I host a dinner once a month.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:09:00.416
- Next one's on Saturday.
- Great, OK.

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:03.213
And it's top-secret.
You can't tell anyone.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.255
What are we talking
about here? Orgy?

00:09:06.413 --> 00:09:08.723
Is it a human sacrifice
of some kind?

00:09:08.882 --> 00:09:12.523
We're... collectors.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.098
I'll let the guys fill you in.

00:09:18.858 --> 00:09:21.338
Some people collect
vintage automobiles.

00:09:21.494 --> 00:09:25.499
Some people collect fine wines.
Fender collects people.

00:09:25.665 --> 00:09:26.837
- People?
- Yeah.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.037
Each of us Ends
a remarkable person

00:09:29.202 --> 00:09:30.909
and invites them
to dinner at Fender's.

00:09:31.071 --> 00:09:33.347
We call it the "Dinner for Winners. "

00:09:33.506 --> 00:09:36.077
Here's the guy
that I invited last year.

00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:38.620
There you go. Look at that.

00:09:38.778 --> 00:09:42.885
The guy designed that suit.
Real-life Iron Man.

00:09:45.418 --> 00:09:48.524
- He took first prize.
- He's an idiot.

00:09:48.688 --> 00:09:49.962
You got it.

00:09:51.024 --> 00:09:54.028
You invite idiots to dinner
and make fun of them?

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:56.037
Mm-hmm.

00:09:56.863 --> 00:09:58.365
That's messed up.

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:01.444
- I know, right?
- It's completely messed up.

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:04.605
Al the end of the night, Fender picks
the best one, gives him a trophy

00:10:04.771 --> 00:10:06.808
and we release him
out in the wild, none the wiser.

00:10:06.973 --> 00:10:10.386
Yeah. No harm, no foul.
Hey, you're gonna do great.

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:13.149
Just have a little subtlety
when you pick your guy.

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:14.724
Fender's a connoisseur.

00:10:14.881 --> 00:10:17.555
Yeah. Hey, and no mimes.
It's a clich�.

00:10:17.717 --> 00:10:19.162
Jacobson brought a mime.

00:10:19.319 --> 00:10:21.663
Exactly. And you don't see
his shit here, anymore, do you?

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:48.121
- Hey.
- Hey!

00:10:48.281 --> 00:10:49.316
Congratulations.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:50.927
So how did it go?
What happened today?

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:53.257
Oh, I'll tell you later.
Look at this crowd!

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:56.662
I know, it's amazing.
We actually sold every painting.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.928
That's incredible!
Oh, my God!

00:10:59.092 --> 00:11:02.938
Except that I did another on
of my name-fiasco thingies.

00:11:03.096 --> 00:11:05.007
Oh, God, What happened?

00:11:05.165 --> 00:11:07.202
The director of the San Francisco MoMA
is here.

00:11:07.367 --> 00:11:10.348
His name is Steve Doche.

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:14.178
And I thought that it
was pronounced "Douche. "

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:17.446
God. It's like the Ron Fuchs
episode all over again.

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.453
It actually kind
of loosened things up.

00:11:19.612 --> 00:11:25.119
And, uh, he's giving Kieran a solo show,
and he wants me to curate it.

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:27.060
Oh, my God!

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:30.394
You know, that is so like you!
You call a guy a douche

00:11:30.557 --> 00:11:32.298
and get your first
museum show out of it.

00:11:32.458 --> 00:11:34.802
You're amazing. I love you so much.

00:11:34.961 --> 00:11:38.704
You�re stunning and you�re smart an
you�re just awful with pronunciation.

00:11:38.865 --> 00:11:41.641
- Hey!
- I'm not Fuching around here.

00:11:41.801 --> 00:11:44.008
Marry me.

00:11:46.506 --> 00:11:48.213
I love you.

00:11:48.374 --> 00:11:51.014
I want to spend the rest
of my life with you.

00:11:52.045 --> 00:11:53.649
But remember when
you asked me before,

00:11:53.813 --> 00:11:56.589
and I said this is a big step,

00:11:56.749 --> 00:11:59.389
maybe we should
just wait a little bit?

00:11:59.552 --> 00:12:00.895
Yeah?

00:12:01.054 --> 00:12:04.763
- That was two days ago.
- I know. I know.

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:07.165
I just need a little bit of time.

00:12:07.327 --> 00:12:10.433
All right.
I'll ask you in two hours.

00:12:10.597 --> 00:12:12.235
Let's go.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.379
Wow, it's packed.

00:12:15.535 --> 00:12:17.344
So, where's the artiste?

00:12:17.503 --> 00:12:20.450
I always try and create
some tension in my work.

00:12:20.607 --> 00:12:23.451
Once a reviewer said
of a certain piece of mine,

00:12:23.610 --> 00:12:25.351
they said,
"I think that's disgusting. "

00:12:25.511 --> 00:12:28.515
I said, "Good!
I want it to disgust you. "

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:32.629
Sometimes I'll be working on a piece
and I'll think, "No, this is bullshit. "

00:12:32.785 --> 00:12:37.632
So I will literally rub bull excrement
on the piece as a meta... metaphor.

00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:40.862
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

00:12:41.027 --> 00:12:43.769
Julie.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:48.779
Kieran, you remember Tim?

00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:52.372
- The stockbroker.
- No. No.

00:12:52.538 --> 00:12:54.984
I, uh, I work for a private equity firm

00:12:55.141 --> 00:12:57.121
that specializes in distressed assets.

00:12:57.277 --> 00:12:59.223
So kind of a stockbroker.

00:13:00.647 --> 00:13:01.955
Almost nothing like a stockbroker.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:04.288
Do you mind if I just call you
stockbroker?

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:07.226
That's the way I remember people.
You're stockbroker Tim.

00:13:09.255 --> 00:13:11.064
Hey, so what do you think?

00:13:11.924 --> 00:13:14.564
Oh! Really... tremendous work.

00:13:14.727 --> 00:13:17.640
They're so big.
And you're in all of them.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:19.936
Come with me, Tim.

00:13:21.067 --> 00:13:22.410
- Enjoy.
- Mm-hmm.

00:13:23.403 --> 00:13:25.940
I have a little ranch...
I say little. It's absolutely massive

00:13:26.105 --> 00:13:28.085
if you actually measure it...
outside of town,

00:13:28.241 --> 00:13:30.517
where I go to disappear,
get away from this bullshit.

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:34.918
One of my zebras was in labor.
It was a messy business.

00:13:35.081 --> 00:13:37.960
The foal was in breech.
At about the 22nd hour,

00:13:38.117 --> 00:13:39.425
I just said, "Stuff it. "

00:13:39.585 --> 00:13:43.533
And I just thrust my hand in,
turned the little guy around.

00:13:43.690 --> 00:13:45.966
- Wow.
- Do you have any idea what it's like,

00:13:46.125 --> 00:13:50.938
Tim, to be up to your elbow...
in a zebra's vagina?

00:13:51.097 --> 00:13:55.102
And feel life?
New life, fresh life.

00:13:57.036 --> 00:13:58.106
No, I don't.

00:13:58.771 --> 00:14:00.773
You should try it, Tim.
It's magical.

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:02.010
Yeah, I'm OK.

00:14:02.175 --> 00:14:05.554
She let me keep the afterbirth
to create this piece.

00:14:05.712 --> 00:14:09.888
Oh, wow, that's disgusting.
I don't think I get it, Kieran.

00:14:10.049 --> 00:14:13.519
Poppycock. You've been
stockbroking too long, Tim.

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:15.825
Oh, wow.

00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:19.668
What does it make you think of?

00:14:19.826 --> 00:14:22.830
I guess it kind of makes me, um...

00:14:22.995 --> 00:14:24.406
...think of your penis.

00:14:25.565 --> 00:14:26.839
Then you get it.

00:14:29.068 --> 00:14:30.513
Julie gets it.

00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:35.212
Hi, I need you to talk
to a buyer. This way.

00:14:36.909 --> 00:14:37.910
See you in a bit.

00:14:40.747 --> 00:14:42.158
Do you know what it's like

00:14:42.315 --> 00:14:45.922
to have your entire head
inside its anus?

00:14:46.085 --> 00:14:48.656
Julie? Poppycock.

00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:54.237
OK, so you're just completely
immune to his animal magnetism?

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.432
He looks good in a pair of hooves.
What can I say?

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:00.401
So, you gonna tell me
what happened today?

00:15:01.334 --> 00:15:03.075
I think I might've
gotten that promotion.

00:15:03.236 --> 00:15:06.342
Really? Oh, my God, that's amazing.

00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:08.179
- Well...
- When? When do you start?

00:15:08.341 --> 00:15:10.014
All right, well, it�s not official yet.
It�s not official.

00:15:10.176 --> 00:15:13.123
- There's this dinner.
- Good. When is it?

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:16.226
- it's, uh, Saturday.
- OK. We can do that.

00:15:16.382 --> 00:15:19.454
No, it's not really
a girlfriend-type thing.

00:15:19.619 --> 00:15:21.257
It's really the guys
from the office.

00:15:21.421 --> 00:15:24.595
- And we have to bring a person.
- What do you mean, "a person?"

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:29.866
A... person with a skill
or a talent of some kind.

00:15:30.029 --> 00:15:32.532
Are you talking about strippers, here?
'Cause I'm not...

00:15:32.698 --> 00:15:34.871
Oh, no, no.
Nothing like that. No.

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:39.744
We have to, uh, bring an idiot
to dinner to make fun of them.

00:15:41.407 --> 00:15:45.719
- OK, that is messed up.
- I know,

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.085
- I know.
- So you told them you're not going.

00:15:49.048 --> 00:15:51.722
Oh, yeah. No, absolutely.

00:15:51.884 --> 00:15:53.886
Tell Fender that
I can't make the dinner.

00:15:54.053 --> 00:15:55.589
Tell him that my back thing is acting up

00:15:55.755 --> 00:15:57.894
and I have to stay in bed
for a few days.

00:15:58.057 --> 00:16:00.401
Why don't I just tell him
you're having your period?

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.904
Tim, I can't stay
on this floor anymore.

00:16:03.062 --> 00:16:05.906
These people are pathetic!

00:16:06.065 --> 00:16:07.908
Happy Birthday, Carol.

00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:09.808
Why can? you just suck it up,

00:16:09.969 --> 00:16:13.416
make fun of some idiots and
stop thinking about yourself for once?

00:16:13.573 --> 00:16:15.519
Susana, I know this is painful for you,

00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:17.586
but sometimes in life
you have to do the right thing.

00:16:17.743 --> 00:16:21.850
Just lie. It's not that hard.
I'm texting a lie right now!

00:16:22.014 --> 00:16:24.085
oh!

00:16:28.254 --> 00:16:29.699
Jesus Christ!

00:16:31.023 --> 00:16:33.196
Are you OK?

00:16:33.359 --> 00:16:36.863
Yeah, I'm OK.

00:16:37.029 --> 00:16:38.940
- Is that a Porsche?
- Yeah.

00:16:39.098 --> 00:16:42.511
Oh, wow. I have been hit
by a Datsun before.

00:16:42.668 --> 00:16:44.978
- Never a Porsche.
- Oh, man...

00:16:45.137 --> 00:16:48.675
- Barry Speck.
- Tim Conrad.

00:16:48.841 --> 00:16:51.788
Are you sure you're OK? I didn't
see you. What were you doing?

00:16:51.944 --> 00:16:56.222
Oh, well, I saw this little guy in
the street and was trying to save him.

00:16:56.983 --> 00:17:00.021
- Uh, I think i!'s dead.
- Yes, that's why he couldn't run away.

00:17:00.186 --> 00:17:01.665
A couple more seconds,
you would've squished him.

00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:03.164
Nice pelt, though.

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:06.294
Ready?

00:17:06.459 --> 00:17:09.406
Uh, I hope those aren't
for your lawyer.

00:17:09.562 --> 00:17:12.634
No. I would rather
not have lawyers get involved.

00:17:12.798 --> 00:17:14.869
All right, I get it.

00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.810
You said you were fine, but...

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.416
What would it take
to keep the lawyers out?

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.313
Five.

00:17:25.478 --> 00:17:28.220
- Oh.
- Five dollars.

00:17:28.381 --> 00:17:30.156
I don't...
What do you mean?

00:17:30.316 --> 00:17:33.490
- Ten dollars.
- Seriously, what? Come on.

00:17:33.653 --> 00:17:35.030
How much do you want?

00:17:37.156 --> 00:17:39.727
- 100 dollars.
- I don't want anything.

00:17:39.892 --> 00:17:42.099
- 500 dollars.
- I don't... it's OK.

00:17:42.261 --> 00:17:44.172
- All right...
- As long as you're OK, then...

00:17:46.365 --> 00:17:48.208
Ten thousand!

00:17:50.069 --> 00:17:52.345
OK, I'll take
ten thousand dollars.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.855
I don't have ten thousand dollars.

00:18:01.013 --> 00:18:03.425
You know what?
Don'! worry about it.

00:18:04.884 --> 00:18:06.921
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:08.588
As long as you're OK.

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.791
- Oh, you're a good person.
- Nah, it's all right.

00:18:10.957 --> 00:18:12.197
- Oh...
- Get out of the road!

00:18:12.358 --> 00:18:14.360
- You are. You're a good person.
- Thank you.

00:18:14.527 --> 00:18:16.438
No, you are.
You're a really nice person.

00:18:16.596 --> 00:18:17.802
All right, well, as long as you're OK,

00:18:17.964 --> 00:18:19.409
- that's OK.
- Thanks. Thank you.

00:18:19.565 --> 00:18:23.206
Yeah. You take care.

00:18:23.369 --> 00:18:25.076
I won't forget this.

00:18:25.237 --> 00:18:29.117
- Oh, you dropped your...
- Oh, yeah. That's my latest series.

00:18:29.275 --> 00:18:34.156
I know. Mouseterpieoes.
Get it?

00:18:34.313 --> 00:18:37.123
- That's the Mona Lisa.
- That's the Mouse-a-Lisa.

00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:40.628
- Mouse-a-Lisa...
- There they are.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:43.892
Found her on the 405.
From here down, she was a mess,

00:18:44.056 --> 00:18:46.832
but the head, perfect.

00:18:46.993 --> 00:18:49.906
Oh, that's Cubism,
Not as easy as it looks.

00:18:50.062 --> 00:18:52.736
We!I, it doesn't look easy.

00:18:52.898 --> 00:18:56.505
I like her. I love the tail.

00:18:56.669 --> 00:19:00.811
- Check that out. You like them?
- I'm speechless.

00:19:01.774 --> 00:19:03.082
Mm. So is he.

00:19:04.176 --> 00:19:06.349
'Cause he's screaming.

00:19:06.512 --> 00:19:10.255
I was stopping by the store today
to get some pelt wax and spine wire.

00:19:10.416 --> 00:19:13.090
You know, wanted to ill the guys in
on what I've been up to.

00:19:13.252 --> 00:19:16.825
Oh, hey, you know what? I have some
in the flesh. Want to see 'em?

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.764
Where did they...?
Oh! Come here!

00:19:18.924 --> 00:19:20.631
Come here!

00:19:22.094 --> 00:19:24.973
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Don't look!

00:19:25.865 --> 00:19:27.344
OK...

00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.377
- All right...
- Can I look?

00:19:29.535 --> 00:19:31.446
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

00:19:33.272 --> 00:19:34.478
Go ahead.

00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:40.780
[Tim} Wow. Incredible.

00:19:43.315 --> 00:19:45.955
Does that guy look
sort of familiar?

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.997
I'll give you a hint.
He wrote the Bible.

00:19:50.356 --> 00:19:51.562
- Is it Jesus?
- Yes!

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:54.136
- You know your stuff!
- Amazing.

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:57.740
Yeah. Well, it's a hobby.
I like to think that...

00:19:57.897 --> 00:20:00.537
...I'm sort of giving them
a second chance, you know?

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:02.145
In the words of John Lennon,

00:20:02.301 --> 00:20:05.805
"You may say I'm a dreamer,
but I'm not"

00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:08.575
"The only one"

00:20:08.741 --> 00:20:10.482
The only what?

00:20:10.643 --> 00:20:11.986
No, that's the lyric.

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:14.351
"You may say I'm a dreamer,
but I'm not the only one"

00:20:14.914 --> 00:20:17.485
Oh... OK, Tim.

00:20:20.019 --> 00:20:22.158
You know, Barry, this was a very
strange way to meet,

00:20:22.321 --> 00:20:24.164
but I think everything
happens for a reason.

00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:26.030
Whoa, whoa.
Did you make that up?

00:20:26.659 --> 00:20:28.104
- Yeah.
- Wow.

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:33.073
"Everything happens
for a reason. " I like that.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:36.679
Thanks. Anyway, tomorrow night,
I'm having dinner with some friends.

00:20:36.836 --> 00:20:40.784
Are you? That's incredible.
Congratulations.

00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.284
I was wondering,
would you like to join us?

00:20:43.442 --> 00:20:46.389
- You shitting me?
- No.

00:20:47.213 --> 00:20:49.352
Say that your girlfriend
thinks meat is murder,

00:20:49.515 --> 00:20:51.290
and she convinces you
to become a vegetarian.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:55.455
Then one day, you're grilling up
a veggie burger, when all of a sudden,

00:20:55.621 --> 00:20:59.433
a chicken comes up, plucks itself,
covers itself in barbecue sauce

00:20:59.592 --> 00:21:01.196
and flings itself on the grill.

00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:03.135
That's God
sending a message, right?

00:21:03.295 --> 00:21:05.707
Yeah, that chicken wants to die.

00:21:05.865 --> 00:21:09.642
No. God wants us
to move to the seventh floor.

00:21:09.802 --> 00:21:13.306
And he sent his only son to tell me.

00:21:13.472 --> 00:21:16.214
Come with me, my children,
to the seventh floor,

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:24.717
Tim! I'd like you to meet
Mr. and Mrs. Mueller.

00:21:25.818 --> 00:21:28.230
Of course! What a pleasure
it is to meet you.

00:21:28.387 --> 00:21:30.560
Mr. Conrad!
You sent the lamp to my hotel.

00:21:30.723 --> 00:21:32.464
- That's... yeah!
- I wished to meet you in person.

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:35.970
Yes, Tim was really helpful when
we came up with the idea for the lamps.

00:21:36.128 --> 00:21:38.233
And we'd been discussing
personal investment as well.

00:21:38.397 --> 00:21:41.105
That's a conversation I'm very much
looking forward to getting back to.

00:21:41.267 --> 00:21:43.247
- Well, I'm glad we could do this.
- Yeah.

00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:47.146
Congratulations on your new Matisse.

00:21:47.306 --> 00:21:50.515
- it's beautiful.
- Oh!

00:21:50.676 --> 00:21:54.249
My wife is a true collector.
It was quite a bidding war.

00:21:54.413 --> 00:21:57.189
Well, to the victor go the spoils.

00:21:57.349 --> 00:22:02.196
You know my family crest.
Our motto continues to inspire.

00:22:02.354 --> 00:22:06.097
- Ad Victorem Spolias.
- Fantastic.

00:22:08.027 --> 00:22:10.132
- Well, shall we?
- Ah.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:14.008
Join us.

00:22:19.205 --> 00:22:22.448
So you follow the art world,
Mr. Conrad?

00:22:22.608 --> 00:22:26.681
I try to. My girlfriend runs
the Cronin Gallery downtown.

00:22:26.846 --> 00:22:30.293
I would love to meet her.
We must have brunch tomorrow.

00:22:30.449 --> 00:22:33.453
They can speak about beauty.
We can speak about business.

00:22:33.619 --> 00:22:35.530
Sounds perfect,

00:22:35.688 --> 00:22:37.964
I'll have my assistant
make the arrangements.

00:22:47.466 --> 00:22:50.003
OK, what the hell just happened?
This guys supposed to be my client.

00:22:50.169 --> 00:22:52.911
- You're still just an analyst...
- No, no, this is better.

00:22:53.072 --> 00:22:55.211
I didn't know it was going
to be a double date.

00:22:55.374 --> 00:22:58.321
Tim's the only one here who isn't
divorced or dating a hooker.

00:22:58.477 --> 00:23:00.184
Wh...?

00:23:00.346 --> 00:23:02.656
This guy wants to invest $100 million,

00:23:02.815 --> 00:23:05.659
Don't mess it up.
We need this.

00:23:07.753 --> 00:23:10.324
Well, the sixth floor steps up.

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:12.491
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

00:23:12.658 --> 00:23:15.229
Hey, rooting for you, buddy.

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:17.340
Good luck.

00:23:18.998 --> 00:23:20.739
My girlfriends not a hooker.

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.174
She tried to give me a BJ.

00:23:22.334 --> 00:23:24.871
If she didn't ask for money,
then she's not a hooker, is she?

00:23:25.037 --> 00:23:28.678
She asked me for money.
It wasn't that expensive, either.

00:23:28.841 --> 00:23:31.879
I still had a ton of singles left over
from your sister's birthday party.

00:23:32.044 --> 00:23:34.285
Hey, is Cinnamon a family name?

00:23:40.619 --> 00:23:42.394
- Oh, hey, honey.
- Hey!

00:23:42.554 --> 00:23:45.967
Glad you're still here. Look,
don't make plans tomorrow morning.

00:23:46.125 --> 00:23:47.536
Why?

00:23:49.895 --> 00:23:52.535
How'd you like to have brunch
with a fascinating Swiss couple?

00:23:52.698 --> 00:23:54.700
- OK.
- She's an art collector

00:23:54.867 --> 00:23:56.141
and he's got a lot of money.

00:23:56.302 --> 00:23:59.374
- I need you. This is huge.
- Oh, it's huge?

00:23:59.538 --> 00:24:01.381
- Mmm.
- Really huge.

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.043
- What's this?
- Huh?

00:24:07.713 --> 00:24:09.056
What is this?

00:24:10.215 --> 00:24:13.389
Oh, uh, that's a...

00:24:13.552 --> 00:24:15.657
...it's a mouse
dressed like Jesus.

00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:17.164
Mm-hmm.

00:24:17.323 --> 00:24:19.428
This guy that I ran into today,
he makes them.

00:24:19.591 --> 00:24:23.004
He's amazing.
He's some kind of artisan.

00:24:23.162 --> 00:24:26.632
Really?
Are you doing that dinner?

00:24:27.232 --> 00:24:28.609
No.

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:32.905
Wham? Hey, come on.

00:24:33.072 --> 00:24:34.574
No, not when you're lying to me.

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:37.653
- Julie, Fender invited me.
- So?

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:40.814
Fender, as in Fender Financial?

00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:43.586
The you I know
would have just said no.

00:24:43.749 --> 00:24:46.491
The me that you know did say no.

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:48.996
But the me you don't know
had to say yes.

00:24:49.154 --> 00:24:51.430
- The you I don't know?
- Yes.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.661
Look, there's you
and the me that you know.

00:24:53.826 --> 00:24:56.500
And we love each other
and we have a wonderful life.

00:24:56.662 --> 00:24:58.608
But then there's the me
that you don't know.

00:24:58.764 --> 00:25:02.371
The me you don't know has
to do things sometimes so that you

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:05.014
and the me that you know can
live in this nice apartment,

00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:07.844
and eat at nice restaurants
and go to Cabo for Christmas.

00:25:08.007 --> 00:25:09.850
- He takes care of us.
- You know what?

00:25:10.009 --> 00:25:12.046
There should not be
any you I don't know.

00:25:12.211 --> 00:25:14.213
But there is.
You might not like him.

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.883
I don't like him.
I hate him! But we need him.

00:25:17.049 --> 00:25:19.120
- It's like the CIA.
- The CIA?

00:25:19.284 --> 00:25:23.130
Mm-hmm. The CIA does some pretty
funky, nasty stuff in the shadows,

00:25:23.288 --> 00:25:24.892
but I, for one,
am glad they're there.

00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:27.162
The CIA doesn't
invite people to dinner

00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:31.331
- to make fun of them.
- No. The CIA kills people.

00:25:31.497 --> 00:25:34.341
And I'm getting raked over the coals
because of a little dinner.

00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:35.877
Can I just ask you something?

00:25:36.035 --> 00:25:39.710
Is there any you I don't know
who isn't completely full of shit?

00:25:39.872 --> 00:25:43.012
I'd love to talk to him right now.

00:25:44.343 --> 00:25:45.822
Julie, come on. Julie!

00:25:47.913 --> 00:25:49.483
Julie!

00:25:49.648 --> 00:25:51.491
Julie, where are you going?

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:54.153
I... I have to go meet Kieran
and talk about San Francisco.

00:25:54.319 --> 00:25:55.821
Julie, please come out
of the elevator.

00:25:55.988 --> 00:25:57.160
All right? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:25:57.322 --> 00:25:59.097
I'll call him and tell him
that the dinner's off.

00:25:59.258 --> 00:26:02.068
- I want to believe you.
- You can believe me.

00:26:02.227 --> 00:26:04.707
I'll never see that guy in my life.

00:26:04.863 --> 00:26:06.103
I promise.

00:26:06.999 --> 00:26:09.673
Oh, my...
Let's talk later.

00:26:09.835 --> 00:26:10.779
- In a few hours.
- What?

00:26:10.936 --> 00:26:11.914
I think we need to cool off.

00:26:12.071 --> 00:26:14.347
- Gosh, I hate when that happens.
- We'll talk in a bit, OK?

00:26:14.506 --> 00:26:16.850
- Just give ourselves a moment...
- Ah!

00:26:17.009 --> 00:26:18.784
I feel like I'm in The Shining.

00:26:20.379 --> 00:26:23.519
Ow!

00:26:23.682 --> 00:26:25.184
You are welcome.

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:28.229
Oh, God. My back, my back, my back.

00:26:28.387 --> 00:26:30.628
Is it your back?

00:26:30.789 --> 00:26:31.927
What the hell are you doing here?

00:26:32.091 --> 00:26:33.365
Well, I went to the address
you gave me.

00:26:33.525 --> 00:26:34.936
Nobody was there.

00:26:35.094 --> 00:26:37.096
Are we having this dinner or not?

00:26:38.097 --> 00:26:40.805
Ow...
OK, just... slow.

00:26:40.966 --> 00:26:42.104
Shh...

00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:44.605
Au right.

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:50.817
- What are you doing?
- I'm applying heat.

00:26:50.976 --> 00:26:52.717
Barry, please stop doing that.

00:26:56.548 --> 00:26:58.221
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- I'm gonna fix your back.

00:26:58.383 --> 00:27:00.488
- Barry, stop!
- I am a trained taxidermist.

00:27:00.652 --> 00:27:03.724
- And I am alive.
- Wow. You are tight.

00:27:03.889 --> 00:27:06.062
- Oh, God!
- OK...

00:27:07.326 --> 00:27:08.464
Wow, look at that face!

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:10.664
- Stop it!
- OK, all right.

00:27:12.397 --> 00:27:13.967
I hope this doesn't mess up dinner.

00:27:14.133 --> 00:27:15.942
We're not having dinner tonight.

00:27:16.101 --> 00:27:18.911
- it's tomorrow,
- I don'! think so, Tim.

00:27:19.071 --> 00:27:21.073
Barry, I made the plans.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.617
I know when it is.

00:27:24.143 --> 00:27:26.180
- I'm pretty sure it's tonight.
- it's not tonight.

00:27:26.345 --> 00:27:29.588
OK. All right.
I guess one of us got confused.

00:27:34.586 --> 00:27:37.499
Great. She left her phone here.

00:27:37.656 --> 00:27:40.466
You know what they say:
everything happens for a reason.

00:27:41.593 --> 00:27:44.506
- You said that.
- You know what, Barry?

00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:48.673
I am really, really looking forward
to our dinner tomorrow night.

00:27:48.834 --> 00:27:52.941
But right now,
I'd appreciate it if you just left.

00:27:53.105 --> 00:27:57.281
And the reason is... '?

00:27:57.442 --> 00:27:58.853
Because I got in a right
with my girlfriend,

00:27:59.011 --> 00:28:03.050
and because I'd like to be here
alone when she comes back, OK?

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:05.691
What if she doesn't come back?

00:28:05.851 --> 00:28:07.831
She's coming back.

00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:13.964
Hey, we are gonna
get through this together.

00:28:14.126 --> 00:28:17.073
I think I know someone
who might make you feel better.

00:28:20.732 --> 00:28:25.408
Remember this guy from the street?
This is you.

00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:27.710
Barry, that was a dead mouse in the road

00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:29.978
a couple of hours ago.
Please get it away from my face.

00:28:30.142 --> 00:28:31.815
It's like looking
in a mirror, isn't it?

00:28:31.977 --> 00:28:33.354
You feel better?

00:28:33.512 --> 00:28:35.822
- it's amazing.
- Are you cheered up?

00:28:35.981 --> 00:28:39.485
Barry, I have
a back brace in my bedroom.

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:42.655
If you could just help me
get off this couch...

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.164
- Sure.
- I want to do this

00:28:44.323 --> 00:28:46.166
very slowly and carefully.

00:28:46.325 --> 00:28:48.327
- Mm-hmm.
- On the count of...

00:28:48.493 --> 00:28:50.370
Three!

00:28:54.066 --> 00:28:55.909
- All you.
- All right.

00:29:03.041 --> 00:29:05.851
Now, I... If I could just...

00:29:08.046 --> 00:29:09.548
You can do it. You got it!

00:29:09.715 --> 00:29:11.126
Oh, yeah!

00:29:11.283 --> 00:29:12.785
Yeah, Tim!

00:29:12.951 --> 00:29:15.591
- You got this! I'll help!
- No, no, no! I have it.

00:29:15.754 --> 00:29:17.700
- All right.
- I'm good.

00:29:17.856 --> 00:29:21.633
Tim, you look good!

00:30:29.027 --> 00:30:30.097
What are you doing?

00:30:32.431 --> 00:30:34.342
- What are you doing?
- Computer,

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:38.178
Oh, my God!
You gave her my address?!

00:30:38.337 --> 00:30:40.840
She's very concerned about you.

00:30:41.006 --> 00:30:43.714
Barry, this woman is a nightmare.

00:30:43.875 --> 00:30:46.446
She's been stalking me
for three years!

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:49.114
I slept with her one night,
biggest mistake of my life.

00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:51.283
It was before I even met Julie.

00:30:51.450 --> 00:30:53.953
- Why did you do that?
- Because it was New Years

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:56.292
and I was drunk and she was wearing
these fishnet stockings.

00:30:56.455 --> 00:30:58.628
You want me to tell her not to come?

00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:03.633
Go. Go.

00:31:03.795 --> 00:31:05.968
Come to dinner tomorrow
and that's it. Let's go. Move!

00:31:06.131 --> 00:31:08.168
Come on! Go, go!

00:31:09.634 --> 00:31:11.341
Oh, my God, what have you done?

00:31:11.503 --> 00:31:13.483
I'm gonna make it up to you.

00:31:43.335 --> 00:31:44.541
OK!

00:31:44.703 --> 00:31:45.943
OK!

00:31:46.104 --> 00:31:47.515
Oh, well, well, well.

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:50.585
If it isn't little miss panty bottom.

00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:53.018
- I'm sorry, who are you?
- I am a friend of Tim's.

00:31:53.178 --> 00:31:55.749
- Yeah, I don't know you.
- Oh, you don't?

00:31:55.914 --> 00:31:57.359
So you know everything about Tim?

00:31:57.516 --> 00:32:02.465
You are the world's greatest
expert on all things Tim?

00:32:02.621 --> 00:32:04.362
Did Tim invite you
to a dinner tomorrow night?

00:32:04.523 --> 00:32:06.594
According to him,
it is tomorrow night, yes.

00:32:06.758 --> 00:32:10.763
Right. You want my advice?

00:32:10.929 --> 00:32:14.138
- Don't go.
- OK, may I give you some advice, too?

00:32:14.299 --> 00:32:17.212
Do not wear fishnets on New Years Eve.

00:32:17.369 --> 00:32:21.613
It's too cold. When the wind blows,
you gotta go with the hose.

00:32:21.773 --> 00:32:22.774
You know what? I really need to...

00:32:22.941 --> 00:32:24.978
Now, Darla, Darla, come on...

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:27.316
- Darla?
- Yes. He told me all about you.

00:32:27.479 --> 00:32:30.392
Really? What did
Tim tell you about me?

00:32:31.883 --> 00:32:33.556
Told me about the sex.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:35.890
The Sex?

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.128
The dirty, dirty sex.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:40.634
But he lives
with a woman named Julie

00:32:40.792 --> 00:32:42.772
and if she comes home
and Ends you, that, that...

00:32:42.928 --> 00:32:44.737
You can imagine
how she would feel.

00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:47.900
Yeah, I imagine
she'd be pretty pissed off.

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:50.979
I gotta nip this in the bud.
You gotta move along.

00:32:51.136 --> 00:32:53.116
You tell your friend, Tim,
he can, uh...

00:32:53.271 --> 00:32:54.978
You tell him he can kiss my ass.

00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.677
Oh, don't have to. We have a picture.

00:33:00.245 --> 00:33:04.990
Problem solved. I intercepted
your stalker in the hallway.

00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:06.925
- Darla showed up?
- Mm-hmm.

00:33:07.085 --> 00:33:09.588
- And you got her to leave?
- Oh, I don't think

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:12.200
you're ever gonna see her again.

00:33:13.325 --> 00:33:16.534
Wow! Who is that?

00:33:16.695 --> 00:33:19.505
Kieran Vollard. He's an artist.

00:33:19.664 --> 00:33:23.202
Very attractive man. He can it
a whole octopus in his mouth.

00:33:23.368 --> 00:33:25.507
Sort of an animal magnetism
about him.

00:33:25.670 --> 00:33:26.774
That's what Julie says.

00:33:28.206 --> 00:33:31.653
"For Julie.
Thanks for everything. Kieran. "

00:33:32.711 --> 00:33:33.781
Everything?

00:33:33.945 --> 00:33:36.016
Yeah, she curated his show.

00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:38.957
Hmm... Bet that's not all she curated.

00:33:39.117 --> 00:33:41.290
I don't know what that means,
Barry.

00:33:41.453 --> 00:33:43.990
Well, I don't know
what curated means.

00:33:44.155 --> 00:33:45.156
Where is she?

00:33:47.459 --> 00:33:49.302
Working.

00:33:50.228 --> 00:33:52.139
Probably with Kieran.

00:33:52.297 --> 00:33:55.471
Where? In his bed?

00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:58.738
I seriously doubt they're
working in his bed.

00:33:58.904 --> 00:34:01.384
Well, if they're not working,
why are they in his bed?

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:05.386
Oh, Tim, you need to call
Kieran's house and see if she's there.

00:34:05.544 --> 00:34:06.818
I'm not doing that.

00:34:06.978 --> 00:34:08.355
L!'s the only way
you're gonna know for sure.

00:34:08.513 --> 00:34:10.083
- I'm not calling.
- I'm telling you...

00:34:10.248 --> 00:34:13.821
No, I'm not gonna call Kieran and say
I don't know where Julie is.

00:34:13.985 --> 00:34:15.521
- Do it. Do it.
- No. No.

00:34:15.687 --> 00:34:18.395
- All right, I will.
- What reason could you possibly have

00:34:18.557 --> 00:34:21.663
- for calling him?
- I want to make a movie about his life.

00:34:21.826 --> 00:34:24.670
I want to make a documentary.
I gain his confidence

00:34:24.829 --> 00:34:27.503
and then he starts feeling more
relaxed about talking to me.

00:34:27.666 --> 00:34:29.509
He's really opening up to me.

00:34:29.668 --> 00:34:31.773
We're talking about his
sex life and then...

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:35.544
...Julie's name pops up
and we've got it on tape!

00:34:35.707 --> 00:34:37.618
- Yeah.
- He's been curated!

00:34:38.176 --> 00:34:40.679
Well, that sounds like
a bullet-proof plan.

00:34:40.845 --> 00:34:42.847
What's his number?

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:46.393
- One-1-1... 1-1...
- Hold on.

00:34:46.551 --> 00:34:47.859
OK. Go.

00:34:48.019 --> 00:34:50.021
- One-1-1
- Mm-hmm. Got that.

00:34:50.188 --> 00:34:51.599
- One-1
- Mm-hmm.

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:53.463
- One-1.
- OK.

00:34:59.898 --> 00:35:02.242
He must've changed his number.
I'm just getting a weird sound.

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.539
Uh... Oh, well. We tried.

00:35:06.037 --> 00:35:08.540
There he is. Kieran Vollard.
I got him.

00:35:08.707 --> 00:35:10.914
Don't! Don't!

00:35:11.076 --> 00:35:13.784
- I'm serious. Don't call him.
- it's ringing.

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:15.288
Hang up the phone.

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:16.892
Hang up the phone!

00:35:17.048 --> 00:35:18.721
I'm gonna do an accent.

00:35:18.883 --> 00:35:20.885
Don't do an accent.
Hang up the phone.

00:35:21.052 --> 00:35:22.122
Hello?

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:24.597
Hello!
How are you?

00:35:24.756 --> 00:35:26.599
This is Nigel!

00:35:27.559 --> 00:35:29.402
I'm a documentary filmmaker

00:35:29.561 --> 00:35:31.905
- from London," England.
- Hang up!

00:35:32.063 --> 00:35:34.805
May I speak to Kieran Vollard,
please?

00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:36.172
This is Kieran.

00:35:36.334 --> 00:35:37.506
Ah, Kieran.

00:35:37.669 --> 00:35:41.276
I want to make
a documentary about your life.

00:35:42.574 --> 00:35:44.576
Start the water,
i'll be right in.

00:35:44.743 --> 00:35:46.120
Yeah, I could do an interview

00:35:46.277 --> 00:35:50.157
Smashing! Champagne wishes
and caviar dreams!

00:35:50.315 --> 00:35:52.488
I will have my man-servant
Contact you with the details.

00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:54.528
That sounded like Julie's laugh.

00:35:54.686 --> 00:35:57.690
She might've been there!

00:35:57.856 --> 00:36:00.427
- I'm going over there.
- No, Tim!

00:36:00.592 --> 00:36:04.039
- Ow!
- You can't drive in this condition.

00:36:04.929 --> 00:36:05.634
Clutch!

00:36:05.797 --> 00:36:07.435
Oh, God, use the clu...

00:36:07.599 --> 00:36:10.102
You can�t just shift.
You need to use the clutch, Barry.

00:36:10.268 --> 00:36:12.612
Oh, God,

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:17.681
OK, hold on. I'll get it.

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:23.948
No, no, no, no...

00:36:24.115 --> 00:36:25.458
- OK.
- I got it.

00:36:26.484 --> 00:36:29.021
Oh...

00:36:33.625 --> 00:36:35.161
She's gotta be in there.

00:36:36.194 --> 00:36:38.003
Just need to get her attention.

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:46.346
- Those were my car keys, weren't they?
- Uh-huh.

00:36:56.014 --> 00:36:58.688
Oh, God.

00:37:03.822 --> 00:37:05.768
Here we go. Let's do this thing.

00:37:05.924 --> 00:37:07.767
Barry! Barry, just...

00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:10.532
Just get the keys and come back!

00:37:10.695 --> 00:37:12.003
Barry!

00:37:17.035 --> 00:37:18.446
I am inside the apartment.

00:37:18.603 --> 00:37:20.276
I know. I want you
out of the apartment.

00:37:20.438 --> 00:37:21.746
Get the keys
and let's get out of here!

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.580
Oh, Tim, I wish you could see
this place! it's amazing!

00:37:24.743 --> 00:37:26.586
I thought you had
a great apartment.. This...

00:37:26.745 --> 00:37:30.784
This, my friend...
Oh, my God!

00:37:33.685 --> 00:37:36.029
He's friends with Morgan Freeman.

00:37:36.187 --> 00:37:38.690
Please get the hell out of there.

00:37:43.027 --> 00:37:44.097
He's coming!

00:38:23.902 --> 00:38:25.973
- Cat got the Tim mouse!
- Forget about the mouse!

00:38:26.137 --> 00:38:27.138
Come on!

00:38:28.173 --> 00:38:29.914
Get the keys
and get out of there!

00:38:30.074 --> 00:38:33.248
Forget the mouse!

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:44.122
Thank you.

00:38:44.289 --> 00:38:45.927
Hey! He's OK!

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:48.434
Hide! Hide!

00:39:03.441 --> 00:39:05.352
Kieran, I'm ready.

00:39:09.013 --> 00:39:10.651
Barry!

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:12.454
Mm] Barry]

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:18.866
Julie's here.

00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:24.871
On, yes...

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:26.633
Sounds like
they're having intercourse.

00:39:26.798 --> 00:39:30.041
Oh, fantastic,

00:39:34.672 --> 00:39:36.811
I'm having trouble describing
what I'm looking at.

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:39.854
Fly, fly...

00:39:42.347 --> 00:39:45.226
Yes! Primordial...

00:39:53.157 --> 00:39:54.192
Hello.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.836
- Who are you?
- Um...

00:39:57.996 --> 00:40:01.341
Monique, Christina, this is Tim.

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:03.274
He's a stockbroker,
or something like that.

00:40:03.434 --> 00:40:06.881
- Tim, can I help you?
- No, no, no. Sorry, I...

00:40:07.038 --> 00:40:08.346
I'm Nigel Nigel!

00:40:08.506 --> 00:40:12.010
- I'm here doing a documentary!
- You can stop that now, Barry.

00:40:12.176 --> 00:40:16.852
My name's not Barry!
So, what have you done with Julie?

00:40:17.015 --> 00:40:20.462
Tim... has Julie left you?

00:40:20.618 --> 00:40:24.964
Oh, Tim. I was always very
attracted to Julie and I still am.

00:40:25.123 --> 00:40:28.036
You must be broken.
She's a wonderful creature.

00:40:28.192 --> 00:40:29.136
Stop...

00:40:29.294 --> 00:40:31.365
I have to say, though, Tim,
I'm not surprised.

00:40:31.529 --> 00:40:32.530
Really?

00:40:32.697 --> 00:40:34.370
There's not a lot of monogamy
in the animal kingdom.

00:40:34.532 --> 00:40:37.638
Not many animals mate for life.
Penguins do.

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:40.214
I've spent a lot of time with penguins,
and they're really cool.

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:43.750
And maybe you're a penguin,
Tim, but Julie's not a penguin.

00:40:43.908 --> 00:40:48.050
She's a lioness. Don't try to mate
a lioness with a penguin.

00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:53.218
Ever. Have you ever seen
a mammal and a bird mate?

00:40:53.384 --> 00:40:55.125
I've never even heard of that.

00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:58.733
Is that right?
You gonna try and tame her?

00:40:58.890 --> 00:41:00.665
'Cause I don't think you're her type.

00:41:00.825 --> 00:41:04.068
Maybe. But I have something.

00:41:04.228 --> 00:41:06.401
Something that women respond to.

00:41:06.564 --> 00:41:09.738
That's true.
Julie and I have been saying that.

00:41:09.901 --> 00:41:11.903
- Tim doesn't get it.
- He's right.

00:41:12.070 --> 00:41:13.845
Listen to your friend.

00:41:14.005 --> 00:41:16.918
Am I gonna make love
with Christina and Monique tonight?

00:41:17.075 --> 00:41:20.249
Hell, yes! Guilty.
You caught me out. Yeah.

00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:22.516
But only because
it's part of my process.

00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.421
Your "process?"

00:41:24.582 --> 00:41:26.323
There are two things
in this world.

00:41:26.484 --> 00:41:32.093
Wonderful, visceral, sexy sex...

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:33.667
...and death.

00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.967
Horrible, boring death.

00:41:39.297 --> 00:41:41.504
Now, I'm gonna go off and have
some sex with these girls.

00:41:41.666 --> 00:41:42.940
Before I die.

00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:47.009
- Go ahead.
- If you guys wanna join, that's cool.

00:41:47.171 --> 00:41:49.208
But don't look at me in the eye.
It puts me off.

00:41:49.374 --> 00:41:52.116
- What?
- OK, you're not into it. That's cool.

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:55.553
Good to see ya, Tim,
Thanks for visiting. Great to meet you.

00:41:59.617 --> 00:42:01.290
I wanna grow a beard.

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:05.997
I know you're set on a documentary,
but hear me out...

00:42:06.157 --> 00:42:10.299
Charlize Theron plays Julie.
Kieran plays himself.

00:42:10.461 --> 00:42:12.634
I don't know.
It is something to think about.

00:42:12.797 --> 00:42:13.969
Three, two, one...

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:15.975
Ow!

00:42:17.702 --> 00:42:18.908
- Oh, my God.
- Mm-hmm.

00:42:19.070 --> 00:42:22.142
Oh, my God!
How did you do that?

00:42:23.841 --> 00:42:27.152
A human back and a rodent back
are eerily similar.

00:42:28.713 --> 00:42:30.420
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:42:30.581 --> 00:42:32.185
Now, go.

00:42:32.350 --> 00:42:35.331
- What about dinner?
- it's tomorrow, Barry.

00:42:35.486 --> 00:42:36.487
Tomorrow.

00:42:37.989 --> 00:42:39.866
That's interesting.

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:43.005
You say you're over Darla and yet you
have a picture of her in your apartment.

00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:44.765
How does Julie feel about that?

00:42:48.066 --> 00:42:49.545
That is Julie.

00:42:50.535 --> 00:42:51.878
Hmm?

00:42:53.438 --> 00:42:56.282
Barry, is that the woman
you talked to in the hallway?

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:01.717
Hmm...

00:43:01.879 --> 00:43:03.415
Well...

00:43:04.182 --> 00:43:06.025
She has the same face.

00:43:08.719 --> 00:43:10.528
I'll get the door.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.767
Where's Tim?

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:20.706
- Oh, God.
- Well, well.

00:43:21.966 --> 00:43:23.877
You blew it with Julie.

00:43:24.035 --> 00:43:26.208
Just like you blew it with me.

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.213
Poor Mme Timmy.

00:43:28.372 --> 00:43:30.716
You missed your chance.

00:43:30.875 --> 00:43:32.980
And you'll never have me again.

00:43:33.144 --> 00:43:36.318
- Let's go.
- Oh! You're hurting me.

00:43:36.481 --> 00:43:38.461
- I'm not," Oh, stop it.
- Owl

00:43:38.616 --> 00:43:39.924
Please, stop hurting me.

00:43:40.084 --> 00:43:43.896
- I'm not even touching you.
- Why do we keep doing this?

00:43:44.055 --> 00:43:47.935
Huh? You know, some day,
I'm really gonna leave you.

00:43:51.996 --> 00:43:53.304
Ugh...

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:56.570
All right, go, go!
Get out of my house, right now!

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:58.577
Ow! Ah! Ow!

00:43:58.736 --> 00:44:00.909
- You're very cruel, Tim.
- Oh!

00:44:01.072 --> 00:44:03.916
- Hello.
- Who's your friend?

00:44:04.075 --> 00:44:05.611
Barry, his name's Barry.

00:44:07.178 --> 00:44:09.419
Wanna watch while I screw
Barry's brains out?

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:11.821
I can honestly
say no to that one.

00:44:11.983 --> 00:44:13.257
Oh, really?

00:44:14.252 --> 00:44:15.993
So, do you guys wanna get pizza?

00:44:18.689 --> 00:44:20.464
Wanna lick cheese
off my naked body?

00:44:20.625 --> 00:44:23.265
Oh, I'm sure Tim has plates.

00:44:23.427 --> 00:44:25.168
- Hello?
- Hey who's Darla?

00:44:25.329 --> 00:44:26.706
I just met your friend earlier.

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:28.275
He told me some pretty
interesting things

00:44:28.432 --> 00:44:30.434
- about this woman.
- What did he saw

00:44:30.601 --> 00:44:31.875
Oh, I don? know. He spoke about...

00:44:32.036 --> 00:44:34.607
Oh, wow, you're
like a friendly dog.

00:44:34.772 --> 00:44:36.843
- ... talked about sex...
- What?

00:44:37.008 --> 00:44:38.112
What exactly did he say?

00:44:38.276 --> 00:44:40.552
Can you just tell me?
Are you cheating on me?

00:44:40.711 --> 00:44:42.713
It's not a difficult question to answer!

00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:46.487
- Hello? Are you cheating on me?
- She put it in her pants.

00:44:46.651 --> 00:44:48.790
Tim! I don't know why it's
so hard for you to answer..

00:44:48.953 --> 00:44:50.864
Julie! You're crazy to think
that I'm cheating on you!

00:44:51.022 --> 00:44:53.969
That's insane!
Where are you? Where are you?

00:44:54.125 --> 00:44:56.696
- Julie!
- Oh, I think I hung up.

00:44:57.795 --> 00:44:59.399
You have no right! Ow!

00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:01.874
No right? Huh?
Barry, we're gonna be a while.

00:45:02.033 --> 00:45:03.637
- You're a crazy person.
- All right, I'll be here.

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:07.647
Hey, Tim?
Tim?

00:45:07.805 --> 00:45:09.978
- Tim?
- Oh, God...

00:45:10.141 --> 00:45:12.985
Tim? Timmy Tim?

00:45:13.144 --> 00:45:15.988
What do you say?
Should we drive him crazy, huh?

00:45:16.147 --> 00:45:17.751
OK!

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:21.055
I'm a naughty little schoolgirl!

00:45:21.219 --> 00:45:22.926
You look a little old
to be a schoolgirl.

00:45:23.087 --> 00:45:25.158
I need to be punished.

00:45:25.323 --> 00:45:27.496
Hey, Naomi, how you doing? It's Tim.

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:29.729
I'm wondering if you've
heard from Julie.

00:45:29.894 --> 00:45:32.170
Don't you wanna
be my schoolteacher?

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:34.367
I'm really not qualified.
I work for the IRS.

00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:36.603
- No, no, no...
- Not tonight.

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:39.247
- No, all the time. I work...
- OK, OK.

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:43.852
You work for the IRS
and I have been very...

00:45:44.008 --> 00:45:45.851
...very bad.

00:45:46.010 --> 00:45:48.456
Have you heard from Julie, by chance?

00:45:48.613 --> 00:45:52.686
- No?
- ... and I need to be spanked! Now!

00:45:52.850 --> 00:45:54.454
Well, that's really
not the way it works.

00:45:54.619 --> 00:45:57.225
You probably just have to pay
the difference, plus interest.

00:45:57.388 --> 00:45:58.958
OK, I...

00:45:59.123 --> 00:46:01.603
- I need you to spank me real hard.
- I'm looking for Julie.

00:46:01.759 --> 00:46:04.137
Spank me hard, Barry!

00:46:04.295 --> 00:46:06.206
- Barry!
- Uh, no, no. That's the TV.

00:46:06.364 --> 00:46:07.707
Ow!

00:46:07.865 --> 00:46:09.435
Ow!

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.876
Oh, yeah! Oh, Barry!

00:46:12.036 --> 00:46:14.414
Ooh, yeah! Oh, Barry!

00:46:20.044 --> 00:46:22.046
Oh, Barry!

00:46:22.213 --> 00:46:24.386
If she gets in touch with you,
please tell her to call me.

00:46:24.548 --> 00:46:25.618
It's an emergency.

00:46:25.783 --> 00:46:28.662
You're like some crazy animal
all over...

00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:30.162
I wanna be a penguin!

00:46:30.321 --> 00:46:32.392
- I like to eat penguins.
- Hope you don't catch me.

00:46:32.556 --> 00:46:33.660
Penguins are very slow.

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:35.235
Except I'm Turbo Penguin!

00:46:36.994 --> 00:46:38.405
- Come here.
- Come on.

00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:40.508
- I'm gonna catch you.
- You can't get me.

00:46:41.065 --> 00:46:42.908
Did you hurt your knee?

00:46:43.067 --> 00:46:46.480
Barry, that's funny,
You are a bad little penguin.

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.616
Don't get me!

00:46:51.342 --> 00:46:52.320
Come here!

00:46:52.476 --> 00:46:54.752
Oh!

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.914
Ooh...

00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:01.497
Oh! Ooh...

00:47:01.652 --> 00:47:05.327
- You're gonna die.
- No, I'm not.

00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.330
Oh, God,

00:47:21.439 --> 00:47:23.476
- God!
- Uh-oh.

00:47:31.849 --> 00:47:32.850
Barry?

00:47:34.285 --> 00:47:37.198
Tim?
Call me! OK?

00:47:37.355 --> 00:47:40.632
This was so much fun!
I love you!

00:47:40.791 --> 00:47:42.293
Forever!

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:45.805
And ever...

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:54.381
Barry!

00:47:54.538 --> 00:47:56.540
Barry.

00:48:01.178 --> 00:48:03.488
Works every time.

00:48:03.647 --> 00:48:07.356
If you are attacked,
you should always play dead.

00:48:07.518 --> 00:48:09.725
People don't want to punch
something that's dead.

00:48:09.887 --> 00:48:11.230
- it's instinctual.
- She's gone?

00:48:11.389 --> 00:48:13.335
Yes, she is.

00:48:13.491 --> 00:48:16.097
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah, we had a little bit of a ruckus.

00:48:16.260 --> 00:48:17.933
Oh, my God!

00:48:18.095 --> 00:48:19.335
That your phone?

00:48:19.497 --> 00:48:20.498
Julie's.

00:48:26.704 --> 00:48:28.843
Kieran.

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:30.849
Hey, listen,
when you get up there,

00:48:31.008 --> 00:48:32.351
let the horse into the pasture.

00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:34.547
She loves to run around
in the grass.

00:48:34.712 --> 00:48:36.714
Grab a bottle of wine,
make yourself a fire,

00:48:36.881 --> 00:48:39.452
stay as long as you want.
This is gonna be good for you.

00:48:39.617 --> 00:48:42.962
- She's going to his ranch.
- Oh, my God.

00:48:44.422 --> 00:48:45.958
- That's code.
- What?

00:48:46.123 --> 00:48:49.366
It's code, Tim.
You should watch Law & Order:

00:48:50.394 --> 00:48:52.032
Horse is heroin.

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.533
Grass... marijuana.

00:48:55.699 --> 00:48:58.942
The horse likes
to run around on the grass.

00:48:59.103 --> 00:49:02.710
The heroin likes
to run around on the marijuana.

00:49:02.873 --> 00:49:06.047
Wine. Alcohol.

00:49:06.210 --> 00:49:07.951
Like beer. Or wine.

00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:11.724
Oh, man, they are planning
one hell of a party.

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:13.759
It's gonna be wild up there.

00:49:13.918 --> 00:49:18.230
I think that you need to get out
of my house in the next... 30 seconds,

00:49:18.389 --> 00:49:20.801
before I beat you to death
with the chair that you're sitting in.

00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:23.768
- What?
- You have to go. I want you to go.

00:49:24.728 --> 00:49:26.230
Who's gonna help you with Julie?

00:49:26.397 --> 00:49:30.072
Who's gonna help me with Julie? You
didn't really just say that, did you?

00:49:30.234 --> 00:49:32.077
Because of you,
Julie thinks I'm having an affair

00:49:32.236 --> 00:49:34.341
and she's on her way to Kieran's ranch!
Whatever you do,

00:49:34.505 --> 00:49:36.075
- don't help me with Julie!
- Whoa! Whoa!

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.481
We should go there and we should
explain the whole mix-up.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:41.748
I don't know where it is. It's unlisted!
He goes there to disappear!

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:46.156
Please, please, I'm begging you!
Go, leave, go!

00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:47.352
I'm sorry.

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:52.100
I'm sorry, Tim.

00:49:55.926 --> 00:49:59.271
Wait. Tim, Tim!

00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:03.606
I work at the Canoga
Processing Center.

00:50:03.767 --> 00:50:07.772
It�s only the second-largest IRS
processing center on the West Coast.

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:09.679
And you're telling
me this now because...?

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:14.220
If Kieran has a ranch, we can End
the address from his tax return.

00:50:14.378 --> 00:50:19.054
And if he's up there sleeping with
Julie, that's not business-related.

00:50:19.216 --> 00:50:20.559
He can't deduct that.

00:50:21.819 --> 00:50:23.127
You can get me his tax returns?

00:50:23.287 --> 00:50:25.028
No.

00:50:25.189 --> 00:50:27.191
But I know somebody who can.

00:50:28.125 --> 00:50:30.127
There it is. The mother ship.

00:50:30.294 --> 00:50:32.137
- It looks deserted.
- No, no, no.

00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:34.572
He's in there. My boss never sleeps.

00:50:34.732 --> 00:50:37.042
Be careful around this guy.

00:50:37.201 --> 00:50:39.738
- He can tell what you're thinking.
- What are you talking about?

00:50:39.904 --> 00:50:43.374
Don't look him in the eye. Don'!
think any embarrassing thoughts.

00:50:43.541 --> 00:50:46.249
Just keep your mind blank.

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:54.328
Therman? I'd like you to meet
a friend of mine, Tim Conrad.

00:50:55.085 --> 00:50:56.393
Uh... Hi.

00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:01.762
I could use some help and Barry says
you're just the man for the job.

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.330
Have 3 Seat.

00:51:04.495 --> 00:51:07.408
I did an audit
on a Steven Conrad two years ago.

00:51:07.565 --> 00:51:09.067
Any relation?

00:51:09.233 --> 00:51:12.180
- Where does he live?
- Bayside State Prison.

00:51:12.336 --> 00:51:14.942
- He's doing seven years.
- Oh.

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:18.018
Are you hiding something,
Mr. Conrad?

00:51:18.175 --> 00:51:19.745
What is it that you do for a living?

00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:22.356
Don't ask.
He makes money.

00:51:22.513 --> 00:51:24.584
Nobody knows where
it comes from, though.

00:51:24.748 --> 00:51:26.523
Shall we take a look
at his return, Barry?

00:51:26.684 --> 00:51:27.924
Mm.

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:32.125
Guys, I think we're
getting a little off track here.

00:51:32.289 --> 00:51:34.360
- I'm in a bit of a rush.
- That's him.

00:51:34.525 --> 00:51:39.372
Gu... Bar... Guys, I don't
have much time, so...

00:51:41.298 --> 00:51:43.039
Mr. Conrad...

00:51:44.935 --> 00:51:48.712
Men lie to me
a thousand times a day.

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:54.211
And my job... is to ind the truth.

00:51:54.378 --> 00:51:56.585
- Right, Barry?
- Mm.

00:51:56.747 --> 00:51:58.226
I've studied the human mind.

00:51:58.382 --> 00:52:02.831
I've learned how to read it
and ultimately control it.

00:52:02.987 --> 00:52:04.830
This is fascinating,
I can't wait to read it.

00:52:04.989 --> 00:52:07.094
It's $14.99 on my website,

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:09.737
- OK.
- Plus shipping and handling.

00:52:09.893 --> 00:52:11.338
Even if I buy it here?

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.441
It's shipped from somewhere else,
isn't it?

00:52:13.597 --> 00:52:15.577
And I've been handling it.

00:52:17.334 --> 00:52:19.405
Uh, could you just tell
Therman why we're here?

00:52:19.570 --> 00:52:23.746
We are looking for an address
of a nondeductible vacation property.

00:52:24.975 --> 00:52:27.114
You're looking for someone
or some thing.

00:52:29.146 --> 00:52:33.424
That's exactly right.
Tim is looking for his girlfriend.

00:52:33.584 --> 00:52:37.157
She ran off with an artist.
They are probably sleeping together.

00:52:37.321 --> 00:52:39.267
- Oh, God...
- Your girlfriend has left you.

00:52:39.423 --> 00:52:43.030
- Tim, he can see right through you.
- You also just told him that.

00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:45.503
Are you still skeptical, Mr, Conrad?

00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:49.206
Watch this. Barry...

00:52:50.934 --> 00:52:52.607
What is he doing?

00:52:52.770 --> 00:52:57.219
He's making me do something.
What is he making me do?

00:52:57.374 --> 00:52:58.648
You're not doing anything, Barry.

00:52:58.809 --> 00:53:01.050
That's right, Barry.
You're not doing anything.

00:53:01.211 --> 00:53:04.215
I'm not doing anything.

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:07.453
I'm paralyzed. Oh, God.

00:53:07.618 --> 00:53:09.529
God can't hear you, Barry.

00:53:09.687 --> 00:53:11.564
- Tim?
- Tim can't hear you, Barry.

00:53:11.722 --> 00:53:15.898
- No, actually, I can hear him.
- My body's a prison.

00:53:16.060 --> 00:53:20.008
Oh! This is so painful.

00:53:20.164 --> 00:53:22.303
I can't move, Tim.

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:26.637
Tim, help me. Help me, Tim.

00:53:26.804 --> 00:53:29.148
All right, you know what, Barry?
Just move. You can do it. Just move.

00:53:34.044 --> 00:53:36.888
I release you.

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:42.588
Wow. OK, I will never take
movement for granted, ever again.

00:53:42.753 --> 00:53:47.099
Well, I was wrong. Apparently,
his brain really is your puppet.

00:53:47.257 --> 00:53:48.827
I need an address.

00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:52.838
- Can you help me, please?
- Perhaps. For a price.

00:53:52.996 --> 00:53:56.500
- How much?
- I just need to hear Barry say,

00:53:56.667 --> 00:53:58.669
"You can eat my pudding. "

00:53:58.836 --> 00:54:01.840
Uh-uh. No.

00:54:02.005 --> 00:54:05.179
Barry, I can make you say it.

00:54:05.342 --> 00:54:10.587
But with your own free will, say,
"You can eat my pudding. "

00:54:10.748 --> 00:54:13.058
I�m not gonna say it.

00:54:13.217 --> 00:54:14.958
Barry, I'm gonna eat it, anyway!

00:54:15.119 --> 00:54:19.033
But I want you to say,
"You can eat my pudding!"

00:54:20.691 --> 00:54:24.195
Barry, I will give you a thousand
dollars if you say it, right now.

00:54:24.361 --> 00:54:25.863
A thousand dollars?

00:54:26.029 --> 00:54:28.703
Barry, your friend is a high roller.

00:54:28.866 --> 00:54:32.370
- You are hiding something.
- Wait a minute. No, wait...

00:54:32.536 --> 00:54:35.039
Um, uh... Can we just stick
to the issue at hand?

00:54:35.205 --> 00:54:37.378
Oh... You almost had me.

00:54:37.541 --> 00:54:40.215
But you cannot declare
offshore investment losses

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:44.382
against future capital gains.
Any child knows that.

00:54:44.548 --> 00:54:47.722
I'll have to ask
my accountant about that.

00:54:52.723 --> 00:54:54.566
Uh...

00:55:07.404 --> 00:55:09.111
Mr. Conrad...

00:55:09.273 --> 00:55:11.651
...you, my friend, are being audited.

00:55:11.809 --> 00:55:13.618
NO, HO, HO.

00:55:13.777 --> 00:55:15.450
Call the 800 number.

00:55:17.621 --> 00:55:18.793
I release you.

00:55:21.658 --> 00:55:23.798
Hey, Tim?

00:55:26.531 --> 00:55:29.637
I guess you just have to remember
what the wise man once said...

00:55:31.069 --> 00:55:33.345
"Everything happens
for a reason. "

00:55:34.873 --> 00:55:37.150
- You know who said that?
- Shut up, Barry.

00:55:38.310 --> 00:55:40.586
- You did. You're the wise man.
- Don't talk.

00:55:40.746 --> 00:55:42.692
Don't say a word.
Don't move your lips.

00:55:46.318 --> 00:55:49.163
Oh, my God. It's Martha.

00:55:49.322 --> 00:55:51.268
It's my ex-wife.

00:55:58.098 --> 00:56:00.670
There's my magic man.

00:56:11.546 --> 00:56:13.890
- Look at you. OK,
- Get in the car, Pudding.

00:56:25.028 --> 00:56:26.701
I used to call her Pudding.

00:56:29.032 --> 00:56:31.808
Look, why don't we just each
go home, we'll get some sleep,

00:56:31.968 --> 00:56:33.276
and I'll see you tomorrow
at the dinner.

00:56:33.436 --> 00:56:36.111
OK. Oh...

00:56:37.975 --> 00:56:40.114
I think I left
my bus pass at your apartment.

00:56:40.277 --> 00:56:42.223
- I'll drive you home.
- OK.

00:56:42.379 --> 00:56:46.385
Oh! I left my keys
at your apartment, too.

00:56:47.986 --> 00:56:51.058
That's OK. You know what?
I'll just sleep here. I have a cubicle.

00:56:51.222 --> 00:56:53.065
- I can pull two chairs together.
- it's all right.

00:56:53.224 --> 00:56:55.602
- Get in the car.
- I can fashion them into a bed.

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:58.264
They... Well, they sort of roll
apart in the middle, so...

00:56:58.431 --> 00:57:00.069
- Barry, Barry...
- ... you sag,

00:57:00.232 --> 00:57:02.143
- You can stay with me.
- Don't worry about me.

00:57:02.301 --> 00:57:04.645
- I insist.
- Really?

00:57:04.804 --> 00:57:07.182
- Yeah.
- I won't cramp your style?

00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:10.185
- it's already cramped.
- OK.

00:57:19.519 --> 00:57:22.091
Wow.

00:57:22.256 --> 00:57:24.600
- What are you doing?
- You're gonna propose to her?

00:57:24.759 --> 00:57:26.761
I have, a few times.

00:57:26.928 --> 00:57:29.431
- Why do you carry this around?
- In case she changes her mind.

00:57:29.597 --> 00:57:31.804
- Please don't go through my pockets.
- OK.

00:57:36.271 --> 00:57:38.012
Hey, Tim?

00:57:38.173 --> 00:57:40.449
The first night alone is always the hardest

00:57:41.176 --> 00:57:43.122
I can sleep in there
with you if you want.

00:57:43.278 --> 00:57:45.020
No, thank you.

00:57:45.181 --> 00:57:47.457
Hey, just don't think about
the fact you can't sleep.

00:57:47.617 --> 00:57:50.791
Because then you're sunk. Then you just
start thinking, "Wow, what's going on?"

00:57:50.954 --> 00:57:52.297
Your mind starts reeling.

00:57:52.455 --> 00:57:54.958
"Where's Julie?
Oh, she's with Kieran. "

00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:57.970
"Is he a better lover than I am?
Yes, he is. "

00:57:58.129 --> 00:57:59.699
Don't think about that.

00:57:59.864 --> 00:58:02.868
Gel those thoughts
out of your head.

00:58:03.034 --> 00:58:06.572
- Why are you putting on aftershave?
- Oh, force of habit.

00:58:07.839 --> 00:58:10.718
When I was married, I used to stay up
late working on my mice,

00:58:10.876 --> 00:58:13.015
and Martha hated
the smell of formaldehyde.

00:58:14.379 --> 00:58:16.154
You can smell them both, Barry.

00:58:16.314 --> 00:58:20.195
Two layers of bad smell.

00:58:20.353 --> 00:58:23.493
That's exactly
what Martha used to say.

00:58:25.191 --> 00:58:26.431
Good night.

00:58:35.035 --> 00:58:36.412
Tim?

00:58:40.908 --> 00:58:43.719
- Tim?
- What, Barry?

00:58:43.878 --> 00:58:45.619
I can't sleep.
I'm too excited about dinner.

00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:47.851
- Oh, God!
- What are you gonna wear?

00:58:48.016 --> 00:58:50.428
Should I rent a tux?
Or is that too formal?

00:58:50.585 --> 00:58:51.586
Here's the thing:

00:58:51.753 --> 00:58:54.360
It's always better to be overdressed
than under dressed, right?

00:59:01.263 --> 00:59:05.269
Thanks, Tim! That's great!

00:59:05.435 --> 00:59:09.474
Oh, he ate it!
He's eating paper!

00:59:10.540 --> 00:59:13.043
No...

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:18.789
I'll be back in a few hours.

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:21.019
Don't play with the stove.

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:23.858
Don't do anything with electricity.

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:26.692
Do you understand?

01:00:26.857 --> 01:00:28.962
Sometimes I think
you think I'm an idiot.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.367
Just stay in the chair.
Promise me.

01:00:31.528 --> 01:00:35.635
I will. I will stay in the chair.
Why is this brunch so important?

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.710
Because the future of my career
depends on it.

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:39.815
It's a very important potential client.

01:00:39.971 --> 01:00:41.314
I can help.

01:00:41.472 --> 01:00:42.974
You want to help me?
Stay in the chair.

01:00:43.141 --> 01:00:44.518
OK.

01:00:44.676 --> 01:00:47.213
I'll pick you up for dinner.
All right?

01:00:49.247 --> 01:00:51.319
- You gonna stay in that chair?
Yes.

01:00:51.483 --> 01:00:52.689
That's it.

01:01:02.262 --> 01:01:03.240
Hello?

01:01:03.396 --> 01:01:05.000
You got everything
you need for brunch?

01:01:05.165 --> 01:01:08.510
- Uh-huh.
- OK, you got me working Saturday,

01:01:08.668 --> 01:01:10.739
so I'm billing you overtime for this.

01:01:10.904 --> 01:01:13.852
You're going
to Madison Restaurant, 10am.

01:01:14.008 --> 01:01:15.919
Don't be late. They're Swiss.

01:01:16.077 --> 01:01:18.023
And make sure Julie�s there.

01:01:18.179 --> 01:01:21.285
- They're dying to meet her.
- OK, Julie'll be there.

01:01:22.783 --> 01:01:23.853
Tim?

01:01:24.018 --> 01:01:25.589
Tim!

01:01:27.089 --> 01:01:28.534
Tim?

01:01:40.637 --> 01:01:43.481
Tim? Tim!

01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:44.744
Tim!

01:01:45.642 --> 01:01:47.280
Hi, Tim?
We switched phones.

01:01:47.443 --> 01:01:51.790
I need to talk to you. Julie has
to go to that brunch! OK,

01:01:54.418 --> 01:01:55.453
Oh!

01:01:57.655 --> 01:02:00.728
Hi, Tim, me again. I just realized
you can't get my messages.

01:02:00.892 --> 01:02:04.635
My password is
P- A-S-S-W-O-R-D.

01:02:04.796 --> 01:02:06.298
OK.

01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:10.469
Oh, God!

01:02:10.635 --> 01:02:12.582
You can'! get that message, either!
Why am I...?!

01:02:18.811 --> 01:02:21.257
- This way, sir.
- Thank you.

01:02:22.481 --> 01:02:24.655
We feared that some
disaster had befallen you.

01:02:24.818 --> 01:02:27.594
- I�m so sorry I�m late.
- And where is...?

01:02:27.754 --> 01:02:31.861
Julie sends her regrets.
She dropped a box on her foot

01:02:32.025 --> 01:02:34.096
and broke a distal phalange.

01:02:34.261 --> 01:02:36.173
Please wish her a swift recovery.

01:02:36.331 --> 01:02:39.107
I had hoped for another woman
to lend some poetry.

01:02:39.267 --> 01:02:41.008
I understood from my husband

01:02:41.169 --> 01:02:43.945
I would not have to suffer
another business conversation.

01:02:44.105 --> 01:02:46.450
What was it Baudelaire said?

01:02:46.608 --> 01:02:49.020
"Misunderstanding makes
the world go 'round. "

01:02:49.178 --> 01:02:51.488
I see we will have poetry after all.

01:02:51.647 --> 01:02:54.787
It is rare to find an American
businessman with a sense of culture.

01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:55.951
Mm.

01:03:06.563 --> 01:03:10.706
Tim! It's me again! Barry!
Disregard all previous messages!

01:03:10.868 --> 01:03:14.645
I figured it out!
Help is on the way! Bye!

01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.487
Obviously, many
of the strategies are complex.

01:03:19.643 --> 01:03:23.524
- I imagine you have several questions.
- I am a simple man, Mr. Conrad.

01:03:23.682 --> 01:03:27.653
My father left me with very little,
except for all of his money.

01:03:27.819 --> 01:03:30.993
The world is full of people
who want to separate me from it.

01:03:31.156 --> 01:03:34.661
Why should I trust you
with $100 million?

01:03:34.827 --> 01:03:37.501
A very fair question.

01:03:37.663 --> 01:03:41.008
Now, you're obviously
very civilized people.

01:03:41.167 --> 01:03:44.741
But unfortunately, the world
of finance is a brutal place.

01:03:44.905 --> 01:03:49.183
The good hunters win.
The bad hunters lose.

01:03:49.343 --> 01:03:51.755
I am a very good hunter.

01:03:51.912 --> 01:03:54.859
You are refreshingly honest,
Mr. Conrad.

01:03:55.015 --> 01:03:58.259
I try to be.
I hope we can do business together.

01:03:59.788 --> 01:04:00.789
A call for you, sir.

01:04:04.025 --> 01:04:06.198
I'm so sorry.
Excuse me. Hello?

01:04:06.361 --> 01:04:07.772
I got your back, Tim.
Can you hear me?

01:04:07.929 --> 01:04:09.068
- Hello?
- Hello!

01:04:09.231 --> 01:04:10.403
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

01:04:10.566 --> 01:04:12.876
Hello. Hello.

01:04:13.035 --> 01:04:18.451
Hello. My name is Tim's brother,
Barry, and this is Julie.

01:04:18.607 --> 01:04:21.214
Tim, look. I brought Julie.

01:04:21.378 --> 01:04:25.326
Hi, my love.
Oh, I have missed you so.

01:04:26.883 --> 01:04:28.920
Um, you...

01:04:29.085 --> 01:04:32.067
You know... Your phalange.
You shouldn't be here.

01:04:32.223 --> 01:04:35.329
Nonsense,
She is the picture of health.

01:04:35.493 --> 01:04:38.235
Please, sit. Sit. Sit.

01:04:41.799 --> 01:04:43.336
Thank you.

01:04:46.171 --> 01:04:48.447
- Birgit Mueller.
- Such a pleasure.

01:04:48.607 --> 01:04:51.087
- Martin Mueller, delighted.
- Such a pleasure.

01:04:51.243 --> 01:04:54.122
And I am Barry. Delightful.

01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:59.922
I am so pleased you could join us.
I always say you do not know a man

01:05:00.086 --> 01:05:02.657
until you meet his partner in love.

01:05:02.822 --> 01:05:06.600
I couldn't agree more. I would love
to go over some of these main points.

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.537
- Where are you from'?!
- We are from Switzerland.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:14.669
- We're gonna focus on business.
- Switzerland! I love Switzerland.

01:05:14.835 --> 01:05:16.439
It is one of my favorite countries.

01:05:16.604 --> 01:05:19.950
I love your army knives,
with the toothpicks.

01:05:20.108 --> 01:05:25.057
And your cheese. Does the cheese
come out of the cow with the holes?

01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:30.353
Our countries are not enemies.
They are friends.

01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.694
- We are friends,
- You have been to Switzerland?

01:05:33.856 --> 01:05:36.632
No, bull have a friend
who drives a Volvo.

01:05:36.792 --> 01:05:38.794
And I speak a little of your language.

01:05:44.368 --> 01:05:46.974
That's my brother.
Always joking.

01:05:47.137 --> 01:05:50.346
Oh! It�s a jokey joke, ja?

01:05:56.481 --> 01:06:00.827
Uh, you know, we should, uh, continue
this conversation back in my office.

01:06:00.985 --> 01:06:03.693
But I have not received my salmon.

01:06:03.855 --> 01:06:06.837
Or my green salad.

01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:12.504
So...

01:06:12.665 --> 01:06:16.842
...do you and Julie have
wedding bells in your future?

01:06:17.003 --> 01:06:21.679
That's kind of a sore topic. He keeps
asking her, but she keeps saying no.

01:06:21.841 --> 01:06:24.082
Ask me again.

01:06:24.244 --> 01:06:26.952
No, it's not the right time.

01:06:27.113 --> 01:06:30.687
If a woman asks you to propose,
it is the right time.

01:06:30.851 --> 01:06:32.524
Really, I can't.

01:06:32.687 --> 01:06:34.894
- Why not?
- Do it. Do it!

01:06:35.056 --> 01:06:36.865
- I don't have a ring.
- Yeah, you do.

01:06:37.024 --> 01:06:39.733
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do, it's in your pocket.

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:43.240
- Come on, You know you have it.
- Barry...

01:06:43.398 --> 01:06:45.708
- Told ya.
- Ah.

01:06:45.867 --> 01:06:47.540
You are a hunter, Mr. Conrad.

01:06:47.703 --> 01:06:49.944
There is nothing more
honorable than for a man

01:06:50.105 --> 01:06:52.712
to join himself to his lady love.

01:06:52.875 --> 01:06:57.153
Join yourself to her,
in the name of love.

01:06:57.313 --> 01:06:59.816
Join yourself
in the name of love.

01:07:01.417 --> 01:07:05.161
You must kneel, Mr. Conrad.
She is a princess.

01:07:05.956 --> 01:07:07.401
Thank you.

01:07:16.835 --> 01:07:19.145
Something's happening!

01:07:20.271 --> 01:07:22.273
- Julie...
- Call me Darla.

01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:25.910
- Oh, I don't want to call you Darla.
- Julie's just a nickname.

01:07:26.078 --> 01:07:30.026
- I want it to be real.
- Look into her eyes.

01:07:30.182 --> 01:07:31.354
Look, look.

01:07:33.085 --> 01:07:37.363
There is your home.
There is your future.

01:07:38.959 --> 01:07:39.960
I love you, Tim.

01:07:41.161 --> 01:07:42.834
Do it, do it, do it.

01:07:42.996 --> 01:07:44.873
Do it...!

01:07:45.032 --> 01:07:47.034
- Julie.
- Darla.

01:07:47.200 --> 01:07:51.047
Darla. Will you marry me?

01:07:51.205 --> 01:07:54.311
- Yes. Yes!
- Yay.

01:07:54.475 --> 01:07:56.887
We did it.

01:08:07.656 --> 01:08:09.863
- Julie.
- But I thought this was Julie.

01:08:10.025 --> 01:08:12.528
- Nope. I'm Julie.
- They are both Julie.

01:08:12.696 --> 01:08:14.232
Julie and Julie.

01:08:14.397 --> 01:08:16.468
Susana thought you were
gonna lose your promotion

01:08:16.633 --> 01:08:18.203
if I didn't show up today.

01:08:18.368 --> 01:08:21.713
Look at you. You had a...
replacement all lined up.

01:08:21.871 --> 01:08:23.646
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.

01:08:23.807 --> 01:08:26.186
- This is a huge misunderstanding.
- Let me explain.

01:08:26.343 --> 01:08:30.314
This is Darla. She's a naughty
schoolgirl who cheats on her taxes.

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:32.188
I didn't know whether you
were gonna come today,

01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:35.057
so I brought Darla to keep
things running smoothly.

01:08:35.219 --> 01:08:37.325
Very important
potential client.

01:08:37.489 --> 01:08:39.196
That clears that up.
Yeah. Thank you.

01:08:39.357 --> 01:08:43.828
Darling, you're embarrassing
yourself. it's over.

01:08:43.995 --> 01:08:47.101
She's really quite a catch, Tim.
Congratulations.

01:08:47.265 --> 01:08:49.712
- No! Julie...
- Nice to have met you.

01:08:49.869 --> 01:08:52.509
- He's very crafty.
- Julie! Julie!

01:08:52.672 --> 01:08:55.516
I'm so sorry. I hope we can
continue this at a later date,

01:08:55.675 --> 01:08:58.178
- but, actually, I love her.
- Wait, Tim?

01:08:58.344 --> 01:09:01.053
- Julie!
- Tim?

01:09:01.915 --> 01:09:04.191
Julie! Julie, look...

01:09:04.351 --> 01:09:07.025
Wait, wait. I know that looked awkward,
but you've gotta trust me.

01:09:07.187 --> 01:09:09.963
- Trust you?
- Yes. I trust you.

01:09:10.124 --> 01:09:13.197
I know you spent the night at Kieran's
ranch. I know nothing happened.

01:09:13.361 --> 01:09:14.772
Right?

01:09:14.929 --> 01:09:16.931
I didn't go to Kieran's ranch
last night.

01:09:17.098 --> 01:09:19.544
- I'm going now.
- No! Don't go! Don't go!

01:09:19.701 --> 01:09:21.703
Tim, I have to go. it's my job.

01:09:21.870 --> 01:09:24.317
We're going to San Francisco
this weekend to set up for the show.

01:09:24.473 --> 01:09:26.453
He wants me to be pan
of his artistic process.

01:09:26.609 --> 01:09:30.580
His artistic process...
That means sex, Julie.

01:09:30.746 --> 01:09:32.953
He told me last nigh!
when I broke into his house!

01:09:34.217 --> 01:09:37.460
- You broke into his house?
- Hmm?

01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:41.497
My God. I guess there really
is a you I don't know.

01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:45.663
It's too bad. I was so in love
with the other one.

01:09:54.138 --> 01:09:55.640
- Hop in.
- MOVE.

01:09:55.807 --> 01:09:56.945
OK.

01:10:03.248 --> 01:10:04.921
Tim, Tim. "

01:10:07.019 --> 01:10:08.623
Ow!

01:10:14.994 --> 01:10:16.871
Oh, wow.

01:10:24.338 --> 01:10:25.681
may dead!

01:10:29.944 --> 01:10:32.049
I don't think you're
a very nice person, Tim.

01:10:32.213 --> 01:10:36.458
Just stay out of my life.
And I'm keeping the ring.

01:10:45.528 --> 01:10:48.065
I think that was really good for her.

01:10:49.699 --> 01:10:51.679
Aah!

01:10:56.139 --> 01:10:57.641
See? It works.

01:11:03.513 --> 01:11:05.515
I can't help but think
this is partially my fault.

01:11:05.682 --> 01:11:09.688
Really'?! Well, it is your fault!
It's a hundred percent your fault!

01:11:12.891 --> 01:11:14.336
I'm sorry.

01:11:23.335 --> 01:11:27.340
Hello, Therman. You win.

01:11:27.506 --> 01:11:29.543
You can eat my pudding.

01:11:30.877 --> 01:11:34.017
31 Light hill Drive.
OK, Therman.

01:11:43.057 --> 01:11:44.764
I don't even know
who he is anymore.

01:11:44.926 --> 01:11:49.033
It's like I'm having a bad dream.
I mean, am I crazy?

01:11:49.196 --> 01:11:51.073
Am I completely delusional, here?

01:11:51.866 --> 01:11:53.709
I don'! even know
what's going on anymore.

01:11:56.538 --> 01:11:58.108
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
be unloading this.

01:11:58.273 --> 01:12:00.776
I want to photograph you, right now.

01:12:01.977 --> 01:12:03.251
Um...

01:12:03.412 --> 01:12:06.223
I don't think it's the best time
right now, really.

01:12:07.750 --> 01:12:11.630
It's exactly the best time.
I've never seen you like this.

01:12:11.788 --> 01:12:15.292
You're so raw, so wonderfully visible,
so beautiful.

01:12:16.793 --> 01:12:18.330
This is weird, Kieran.
I don't think we should...

01:12:18.495 --> 01:12:20.338
Not doing this would be weird.

01:12:20.497 --> 01:12:22.773
Keep talking.
Tell me about Tim.

01:12:22.933 --> 01:12:26.142
I don't know. I mean, I just...

01:12:27.771 --> 01:12:30.582
I just always thought
that there was this decent...

01:12:30.742 --> 01:12:33.518
...basic person underneath it all.

01:12:33.678 --> 01:12:36.454
You'd think that you would
know someone after two years.

01:12:36.614 --> 01:12:39.925
But, no. That's bad.

01:12:42.355 --> 01:12:43.800
He's such a smooth talker.

01:12:43.956 --> 01:12:45.435
So convincing.

01:12:45.591 --> 01:12:48.003
I don't even know if anything
he's ever said to me is true.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.539
- These pictures are gonna be amazing.
- Kieran, you've lost your mind!

01:12:51.697 --> 01:12:54.110
- This is crazy. No.
- Don't light it, It's art.

01:12:54.267 --> 01:12:55.769
I don't want to take pictures.
Can we just stop it?

01:12:55.936 --> 01:12:58.974
What are you doing here?

01:12:59.139 --> 01:13:01.210
Julie, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:13:01.375 --> 01:13:04.118
- Kieran has gonorrhea.
- No, I don't.

01:13:04.278 --> 01:13:06.121
- You might.
- I don't.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.123
- Well, she does, She has gonorrhea.
- What?

01:13:08.282 --> 01:13:09.955
- Don't sleep with her.
- She doesn't.

01:13:10.118 --> 01:13:11.654
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

01:13:11.819 --> 01:13:13.662
Because you can get it
from riding the bus.

01:13:13.821 --> 01:13:15.995
- No, you can't.
- Yes, you can, Tim.

01:13:16.158 --> 01:13:19.696
- That's how my wife got it.
- Barry, no one here has gonorrhea.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.343
I do.

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.069
I have gonorrhea.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:33.243
I got gonorrhea from my wife,
who got it from a bus seat.

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.390
And no one should sleep with me.

01:13:40.551 --> 01:13:41.859
OK.

01:13:42.019 --> 01:13:44.727
Could I speak with Julie...
alone, please?

01:13:50.729 --> 01:13:53.505
Tim, you have to tell her
what's in your heart

01:13:53.665 --> 01:13:55.110
- and be honest with her.
- Yeah, I...

01:13:55.267 --> 01:13:57.679
That's what I did with Martha
and that did not work.

01:13:57.836 --> 01:14:03.583
- But I think this'il work for you.
- OK. Thank you. All right.

01:14:12.285 --> 01:14:14.698
Have you ever
just spent five months

01:14:14.855 --> 01:14:17.961
living with a herd of goats,
as one of them?

01:14:19.126 --> 01:14:20.196
- No?
- No.

01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:21.703
That surprises me.

01:14:22.696 --> 01:14:27.043
The thing about a goat is, it never
denies itself what it's hungry for.

01:14:27.202 --> 01:14:28.909
A goat will eat anything.

01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:31.448
A goat could probably eat a bike.

01:14:34.275 --> 01:14:37.780
A goal could eat itself,
if it was driven to it.

01:14:40.749 --> 01:14:43.059
I'm just a goat...

01:14:43.219 --> 01:14:45.392
...who's halfway through
eating itself.

01:14:52.796 --> 01:14:55.743
Just to be clear, what exactly
are we talking about?

01:14:55.899 --> 01:14:58.311
Everything.

01:15:00.403 --> 01:15:04.580
I had no idea. It happened one night
three years ago, before we met.

01:15:04.742 --> 01:15:05.812
I haven't seen her since.

01:15:05.977 --> 01:15:09.515
So she just popped back up
into your life, like that?

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:12.355
She tried to get in touch with me
and Barry intercepted the message.

01:15:12.518 --> 01:15:17.968
- So it's all Barry's fault?
- Barry is... he's a sweet guy,

01:15:18.123 --> 01:15:20.797
but he is a tornado of destruction.

01:15:20.959 --> 01:15:23.200
The only friends
he has are dead mice,

01:15:23.362 --> 01:15:26.435
and that's 'cause they're the only ones
that can't get away from him.

01:15:30.270 --> 01:15:32.841
You know what else mice can't do?

01:15:33.006 --> 01:15:34.952
They can't lie.

01:15:36.510 --> 01:15:39.320
Barry. Barry!

01:15:41.282 --> 01:15:43.057
I'm gonna go
to San Francisco tonight.

01:15:43.217 --> 01:15:46.528
And, uh,.. I'll come by to pack,
around eight.

01:15:46.687 --> 01:15:48.861
I think i!'s better
if you're not there.

01:16:17.754 --> 01:16:20.098
I never really knew
what Martha thought of me

01:16:20.257 --> 01:16:23.330
until I heard her
talking behind my back.

01:16:26.698 --> 01:16:30.168
You were lying to me
the whole time. You didn't like me.

01:16:31.703 --> 01:16:33.444
"How do I get ahead in business?"

01:16:33.605 --> 01:16:36.951
"How do I get ahead?
Oh, I know... "

01:16:37.109 --> 01:16:40.750
"I'll find a great taxidermist
and hit him with my car. "

01:16:40.913 --> 01:16:44.190
"And then I'll invite him to dinner.
That'll do it. "

01:16:45.585 --> 01:16:49.965
Well, somebody forgot to tell
you there is no "me" in "mean. "

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:52.435
Well...

01:16:52.592 --> 01:16:55.869
...there is a bit
of a happy ending.

01:16:56.029 --> 01:16:58.943
'Cause the mean guy finally
got what he deserved.

01:17:05.139 --> 01:17:08.052
World's smallest violin
and it's playing just for you.

01:17:11.813 --> 01:17:14.760
- Sorry.
- What?

01:17:15.984 --> 01:17:19.397
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, OK. Whatever.

01:19:25.792 --> 01:19:27.203
- Hello?
- Tim!

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:29.773
I heard you had
an interesting brunch this morning.

01:19:29.930 --> 01:19:31.273
Sir, I can explain.

01:19:31.432 --> 01:19:35.380
You might want to explain it
to Mn Mueller

01:19:37.538 --> 01:19:40.042
You should have
told me Barry was your fool.

01:19:40.208 --> 01:19:42.779
We have the same game
in Switzerland.

01:19:42.944 --> 01:19:44.719
"Dinner for Unterschlagen. "

01:19:44.879 --> 01:19:46.790
I am very much looking forward

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:49.428
to seeing the two of you
this evening, Mn Conrad

01:19:51.921 --> 01:19:53.559
Where are you?
Dinners about to start.

01:19:54.890 --> 01:19:56.062
There's been a complication.

01:19:56.225 --> 01:19:59.138
Wm, for chrissake,
we're running on fumes.

01:19:59.295 --> 01:20:01.901
If we don't make this deal tonight,
there is no Fender Financial.

01:20:02.064 --> 01:20:05.171
So, hurry up,
We gotta land Mueller tonight.

01:20:13.510 --> 01:20:16.515
My guy's a lock. You know what I'm
saying? Mueller's gonna love him.

01:20:16.681 --> 01:20:17.853
Now, he might be a little late.

01:20:18.015 --> 01:20:19.688
- He's on his way, but...
- Tim!

01:20:21.085 --> 01:20:23.429
Sir, I've run
into a little bit of a problem.

01:20:23.588 --> 01:20:25.693
Never mind that. You know,
ever since I invited you to this thing,

01:20:25.857 --> 01:20:28.099
Caldwell's been
telling me I made a mistake.

01:20:28.827 --> 01:20:30.329
He says you're not cut out for it.

01:20:30.496 --> 01:20:33.340
- Really?
- Caldwell is full of shit.

01:20:33.499 --> 01:20:38.950
Mueller told me your guy was good.
I had no idea he was this good.

01:20:39.105 --> 01:20:40.948
Well, I try to look
at the bright side.

01:20:41.107 --> 01:20:43.451
I guess you could say
I'm an eternal optometrist.

01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:45.817
When life gives you lemons,
you make lemonade.

01:20:45.979 --> 01:20:47.617
Unless you don't have
any water or sugar.

01:20:47.780 --> 01:20:49.623
And then,
then you just eat the lemons.

01:20:49.782 --> 01:20:53.230
The rind will give you diarrhea.
So, mama mia, papa pia,

01:20:53.387 --> 01:20:55.799
baby got the diarr...
Hey, Tim!

01:20:55.956 --> 01:21:00.200
Ah, Mr. Conrad! You have
been missing all the fun.

01:21:00.961 --> 01:21:02.805
Barry... you're here.

01:21:02.964 --> 01:21:05.638
Yes, and I have been telling
Sir Lancelot

01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:07.143
that you deserve a promotion.

01:21:07.302 --> 01:21:09.976
And he's been making
a pretty persuasive case, Tim.

01:21:10.138 --> 01:21:13.210
Tim, I'd like
to introduce my friend, Lewis,

01:21:13.376 --> 01:21:16.255
- and his wife, Diane.
- Your wife?

01:21:16.412 --> 01:21:17.652
For now.

01:21:19.048 --> 01:21:21.824
- Honey, please.
- "Honey, please. "

01:21:21.984 --> 01:21:24.328
You're so pathetic!

01:21:24.487 --> 01:21:27.901
My God, it's raining men.
I don't know who's more gorgeous.

01:21:28.058 --> 01:21:30.664
Well, beauty's only skin deep.

01:21:30.827 --> 01:21:33.398
Unless there's something wrong
with your bone structure. And then,

01:21:33.564 --> 01:21:36.671
you could have flawless skin
and still be very ugly.

01:21:36.834 --> 01:21:40.441
Because your bones
are just... gross.

01:21:40.605 --> 01:21:42.710
Lewis, Diane, there's someone
I'd like you to meet.

01:21:42.874 --> 01:21:44.012
I think you're drunk.

01:21:44.175 --> 01:21:46.678
Not drunk enough to do you.

01:21:46.844 --> 01:21:50.418
Tim, when you said this was
a dinner for extraordinary people,

01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:52.187
I had no idea. Look at that.

01:21:52.351 --> 01:21:55.855
Are you hungry?
He hasn't eaten a lot today.

01:21:56.755 --> 01:21:57.859
Come on.

01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:01.861
- Yes?
- Ugh.

01:22:02.028 --> 01:22:04.474
OK... her.
You know what she does?

01:22:04.631 --> 01:22:06.702
She communicates with dead pets.

01:22:06.866 --> 01:22:11.042
Lorenzo's mother...
wants to talk to him.

01:22:11.204 --> 01:22:13.549
Right? Nice?

01:22:13.708 --> 01:22:18.088
OK, that guy? Right there?
2002 National Beard Champion.

01:22:18.245 --> 01:22:20.418
I'm telling you,
these people are amazing.

01:22:20.581 --> 01:22:23.620
- I am so not in their league.
- Barry, what are you...

01:22:23.785 --> 01:22:27.892
- Why are you here?
- Because that's what friends do.

01:22:28.056 --> 01:22:31.230
I know, I know.
You chose some words carelessly.

01:22:31.393 --> 01:22:33.999
I know you are in a dark place,
but I also know

01:22:34.162 --> 01:22:37.576
that you need to show your boss
that you are friends with a winner.

01:22:37.734 --> 01:22:39.407
In my book,
you're a winner, too.

01:22:41.237 --> 01:22:44.810
Ladies and gentlemen!
Dinner is served.

01:22:50.514 --> 01:22:54.018
The eyes are
but two of the Eve senses.

01:22:54.184 --> 01:22:58.600
Remove them and the others
become incredibly sensitive.

01:22:58.757 --> 01:23:00.668
But some people still ask,

01:23:00.825 --> 01:23:04.932
"How can a blind man compete
at the Olympic Games as fencer?"

01:23:05.096 --> 01:23:06.439
I will show you how.

01:23:07.599 --> 01:23:09.340
Oh!

01:23:09.501 --> 01:23:13.109
Absolutely tremendous!

01:23:13.272 --> 01:23:15.548
- All right!
- Are you enjoying this?

01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:20.316
Yes. Such a pleasure to laugh
at the misfortune of others.

01:23:21.347 --> 01:23:22.793
Are they cute
when they're small,

01:23:22.949 --> 01:23:25.293
or are they pretty much
horrible the whole time?

01:23:26.687 --> 01:23:30.567
- Are you looking down my dress?
- No.

01:23:30.724 --> 01:23:33.296
- Why not?
- I don't know.

01:23:33.461 --> 01:23:35.566
- Tim, were you?
- No.

01:23:35.730 --> 01:23:38.472
- Please don't embarrass me.
- I'm not doing... Oh, God.

01:23:38.633 --> 01:23:41.807
Here you go, sir.

01:23:41.969 --> 01:23:44.472
Here you are, ma�am.
Bon appetit.

01:23:52.247 --> 01:23:55.421
I am receiving a message
from the other side!

01:23:56.720 --> 01:24:00.497
I'm trapped.

01:24:00.657 --> 01:24:02.659
Where are they taking me?

01:24:02.826 --> 01:24:05.170
She's talking to the lobster.

01:24:05.328 --> 01:24:07.501
The water, it...

01:24:07.664 --> 01:24:08.939
...boils!

01:24:23.281 --> 01:24:25.784
That might win. That might win.

01:24:26.885 --> 01:24:29.798
Whoo!

01:24:34.193 --> 01:24:36.764
Ah, fuck it. I don't care.

01:24:36.929 --> 01:24:41.469
So, Tim... I understand your
guest has an interesting hobby.

01:24:41.634 --> 01:24:45.378
I guess I'm up. Wish me luck.

01:24:50.544 --> 01:24:53.582
This is something that I call
the Tower of Dreamers.

01:25:04.993 --> 01:25:08.498
A thousand years ago, the only
people on Earth were monkeys.

01:25:08.664 --> 01:25:12.806
And they said,
"We'll never walk erectus. "

01:25:12.968 --> 01:25:16.575
"We'll never use tools.
We'll never talk. "

01:25:16.739 --> 01:25:21.689
And then one monkey said: "Oh, yeah?
Well, I'm talking right now. "

01:25:21.845 --> 01:25:25.258
That monkey... was a dreamer.

01:25:25.415 --> 01:25:27.588
- Mice dressed as monkeys.
- Yes-

01:25:27.751 --> 01:25:30.096
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

01:25:32.924 --> 01:25:35.268
Fast-forward 500 years.

01:25:38.129 --> 01:25:41.873
The Wright Brothers decide to make
themselves a frying machine.

01:25:42.034 --> 01:25:45.038
"You fools! You idiots!"

01:25:45.204 --> 01:25:47.445
"What's your problem?"
everyone shouted.

01:25:47.606 --> 01:25:51.452
"That will never work because
plywood weighs more than air!"

01:25:51.610 --> 01:25:54.057
To which the Wright Brothers
responded:

01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:56.360
"No, it doesn't. "

01:25:57.617 --> 01:26:00.029
The Wright Brothers were dreamers.

01:26:02.989 --> 01:26:07.666
The Earl of Sandwich
and Sir Francis Bacon.

01:26:07.828 --> 01:26:13.403
Had it not been for them, the BLT
would merely be lettuce and tomato.

01:26:16.471 --> 01:26:19.350
They were dreamers.
And sandwich makers.

01:26:19.507 --> 01:26:22.386
- Ja.
- It's not over yet.

01:26:23.979 --> 01:26:26.391
Vincent van Gogh.

01:26:26.548 --> 01:26:30.497
Everyone told him,
"You only have one ear. "

01:26:30.653 --> 01:26:33.327
"You cannot be a great artist. "

01:26:33.489 --> 01:26:37.403
And you know what he said?
"I can'! hear you. "

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.335
Vincent van Gogh was a dreamer.

01:26:41.698 --> 01:26:43.006
- I love to paint.
- Oh, really?

01:26:43.166 --> 01:26:45.271
- I love to paint.
- Oh, wow. Are you any good?

01:26:45.435 --> 01:26:48.041
- I don't know.
- Of course not.

01:26:50.507 --> 01:26:53.717
Louis Pasteur turned
cheese into medicine.

01:27:03.555 --> 01:27:06.365
Benjamin Franklin.

01:27:06.525 --> 01:27:10.268
People said, "You can't
fly a kite in a rainstorm. "

01:27:10.429 --> 01:27:13.774
And Ben Franklin said,
"Yes, you can...

01:27:13.933 --> 01:27:15.880
...if you have
an electric kite. "

01:27:20.307 --> 01:27:22.583
Little detail with the kite.
That's good, ja?

01:27:22.742 --> 01:27:26.088
A man who broke more bones...

01:27:26.914 --> 01:27:29.087
...than any man in history:

01:27:31.986 --> 01:27:34.933
Evel Knievel.

01:27:38.226 --> 01:27:40.968
It's fantastic.

01:27:41.129 --> 01:27:43.336
Well played, rookie.
Well played.

01:27:43.498 --> 01:27:47.776
And who might this
handsome young lad be?

01:27:48.670 --> 01:27:49.979
Tim Conrad.

01:27:51.407 --> 01:27:55.822
He believes that someday
he will marry the girl of his dreams,

01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:59.426
even though every time
he asks, she says no.

01:27:59.582 --> 01:28:03.087
And even though, as we speak,
she is probably having sex

01:28:03.253 --> 01:28:05.927
with a handsome artist.

01:28:06.090 --> 01:28:09.094
Tim Conrad... is a dreamer.

01:28:16.868 --> 01:28:20.509
So dare to dream.
Dream your wildest dreams.

01:28:20.672 --> 01:28:23.346
You can climb
the highest mountain.

01:28:23.508 --> 01:28:28.151
You can drown in a teacup,
if you find a big enough teacup.

01:28:28.314 --> 01:28:31.693
And if somebody tells you
that you can't do something,

01:28:31.851 --> 01:28:35.128
you say, "Yes, I can. "

01:28:35.287 --> 01:28:39.065
Cause I'm doing it right now!"

01:28:42.796 --> 01:28:44.571
Bravo!

01:28:44.731 --> 01:28:47.143
Bravo, sir!

01:28:51.406 --> 01:28:53.886
You must come to Switzerland.
You'll be the toast of Zurich!

01:28:54.042 --> 01:28:57.216
I can't understand
your accent!

01:29:00.049 --> 01:29:03.587
Caldwell.
This guy's taking it.

01:29:03.752 --> 01:29:06.665
The night is young.

01:29:06.822 --> 01:29:10.827
Gentlemen, ladies, I'd like to introduce
you to Mr. Therman Murch,

01:29:10.994 --> 01:29:14.771
IRS auditor and master
of mind control.

01:29:14.931 --> 01:29:16.842
Therman?

01:29:22.172 --> 01:29:23.675
Sorry for my tardiness.

01:29:23.841 --> 01:29:26.287
Mr. Murch came
by the office last night.

01:29:26.444 --> 01:29:28.185
Shame to hear about that audit, Tim.

01:29:28.345 --> 01:29:30.586
Anything I can do to help,
I'm here for you.

01:29:31.949 --> 01:29:33.360
Barry, what are you doing here?

01:29:34.018 --> 01:29:35.464
Mm". I dunno.

01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:39.693
- You two know each other?
- Yes. We work together.

01:29:40.892 --> 01:29:42.803
I'm gonna have to get
the address of that office.

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:45.202
Therman was telling me about

01:29:45.363 --> 01:29:47.935
some of his techniques for mind control,
and I gotta say,

01:29:48.101 --> 01:29:49.409
I was pretty blown away.

01:29:49.569 --> 01:29:51.207
- Wow.
- Ah.

01:29:51.370 --> 01:29:56.149
Yes. The brain has pressure points,
just like any other muscle.

01:29:56.309 --> 01:29:58.051
Apply those pressure points,

01:29:58.212 --> 01:30:02.490
and the brain will obey
your every command.

01:30:02.649 --> 01:30:05.391
Allow me to demonstrate.

01:30:05.552 --> 01:30:06.724
Barry.

01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:12.894
Barry.

01:30:13.061 --> 01:30:16.065
Look into my eyes, Barry.

01:30:16.231 --> 01:30:18.507
Barry!

01:30:18.666 --> 01:30:21.477
Where is your wife, Barry?

01:30:23.239 --> 01:30:25.515
Tell us. Where is she?

01:30:25.674 --> 01:30:27.915
Come on, Barry, tell us.

01:30:28.077 --> 01:30:33.528
- Your house?
- Yes.

01:30:39.589 --> 01:30:45.165
Let me just get this straight, Barry.
Your wife left you for... him?

01:30:47.365 --> 01:30:50.209
She has extraordinary taste in men.

01:30:53.704 --> 01:30:58.654
And tell us, Barry...
why did your wife leave you?

01:31:04.283 --> 01:31:07.389
- Spit it out of your mouth.
- No.

01:31:07.554 --> 01:31:09.192
- Say it!
- No.

01:31:09.355 --> 01:31:11.301
Say it, boy!

01:31:14.794 --> 01:31:18.799
I lost her clitoris.

01:31:18.965 --> 01:31:23.745
- That's right.
- You lost her clitoris?

01:31:23.904 --> 01:31:25.815
She got mad because
I couldn't ind it.

01:31:25.973 --> 01:31:27.316
Well, you know.

01:31:27.474 --> 01:31:29.249
I said, "it's probably
in your purse,"

01:31:29.410 --> 01:31:31.652
because nine times out of ten
when she loses something,

01:31:31.813 --> 01:31:33.087
that's where they end up.

01:31:33.248 --> 01:31:35.660
Barry, do you even
know what that is?

01:31:35.817 --> 01:31:38.195
I don't know what half
the stuff in her purse is.

01:31:38.353 --> 01:31:41.732
Well, don't worry, Barry.
I found it.

01:31:41.890 --> 01:31:44.337
It was in her purse.

01:31:44.493 --> 01:31:46.166
It was in her naughty purse.

01:31:46.329 --> 01:31:50.402
Wow... I mean, thank God
somebody found it, right?

01:31:52.335 --> 01:31:56.182
I thought I found it
under the couch,

01:31:56.340 --> 01:31:59.048
Turns out it was just
an old piece of chewing gum.

01:32:15.393 --> 01:32:18.534
I release you!

01:32:20.399 --> 01:32:23.141
Ladies and gentlemen,
mind control.

01:32:23.302 --> 01:32:25.111
Bravo.

01:32:25.271 --> 01:32:28.741
Bravo! Bravo!

01:32:30.277 --> 01:32:32.052
Touche, Caldwell.

01:32:32.879 --> 01:32:33.983
That was sweet.

01:32:37.317 --> 01:32:41.323
Barry, you're better than him.
Martha may not see it, but I do.

01:32:41.489 --> 01:32:45.164
Thanks. Thank you, Tim.
You're a good friend.

01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.097
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

01:32:48.262 --> 01:32:52.643
I'm not. Barry, this...
Aw, man, this...

01:32:53.602 --> 01:32:55.639
This dinner isn't
what you think it is.

01:32:57.739 --> 01:32:59.082
What?

01:32:59.241 --> 01:33:01.448
We invited you ail here
to make fun of you.

01:33:03.845 --> 01:33:07.123
So you invite a bunch of incredibly
talented people to dinner

01:33:07.283 --> 01:33:08.489
and make fun of them?

01:33:09.018 --> 01:33:12.295
No. It's a dinner for idiots.

01:33:13.990 --> 01:33:16.335
Well, you'd better
go rind some idiots.

01:33:16.994 --> 01:33:18.268
We do.

01:33:19.596 --> 01:33:24.443
I'm sorry.
Really, I'm so sorry.

01:33:26.270 --> 01:33:30.617
If it's any consolation, Therman
will probably win first prize.

01:33:34.813 --> 01:33:36.224
He'll have that, too.

01:33:36.381 --> 01:33:39.795
And he'll be able to lord it
over me for the rest of my life.

01:33:39.952 --> 01:33:42.956
Barry, Erst prize
is the biggest idiot.

01:33:43.122 --> 01:33:47.969
I know. That guy beats me
at everything. He just...

01:33:48.127 --> 01:33:53.009
I don't know, what's the use?
He has mind control, I don't.

01:33:55.635 --> 01:33:57.410
Barry, look at me.

01:33:59.906 --> 01:34:03.582
Therman has mind control,
but you...

01:34:03.745 --> 01:34:07.488
- ... you have brain control.
- Brain control?

01:34:07.648 --> 01:34:08.922
- Mm-hmm.
- What...?

01:34:09.083 --> 01:34:11.256
- You didn't know you had brain control?
- No.

01:34:11.419 --> 01:34:13.057
I knew it the second I met you.

01:34:13.221 --> 01:34:15.998
You crawled in my brain
and you stayed there.

01:34:16.158 --> 01:34:17.262
- I did?
- You did.

01:34:17.426 --> 01:34:19.702
And I can't get rid of you,
no matter how hard I try.

01:34:19.862 --> 01:34:24.402
You burrowed your way into my brain,
through my ear, like an earwig!

01:34:24.566 --> 01:34:27.343
- I didn't mean to.
- it's like you setup camp

01:34:27.504 --> 01:34:30.576
- and I can't get you out of my head!
- I'm an earwig?

01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:33.687
It's like teeth and spikes
and...

01:34:33.843 --> 01:34:38.691
...all your... spilling out millions
of earwig eggs all in my brain!

01:34:38.849 --> 01:34:41.261
- I can't do anything about it!
- Oh, my God!

01:34:41.419 --> 01:34:43.365
Brain control beats mind control
any day of the week!

01:34:43.521 --> 01:34:46.024
Because the brain tells
the mind what to do!

01:34:46.190 --> 01:34:50.367
You can beat this guy.
You can beat this guy, Barry.

01:34:51.196 --> 01:34:54.643
Barry, you can beat Therman.

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.609
"You may say I'm a dreamer... "

01:34:58.537 --> 01:35:01.280
"But I'm not the only one"

01:35:09.081 --> 01:35:11.391
I'm going to go
lay eggs in his brain.

01:35:15.722 --> 01:35:19.727
- Back for more, Barry?
- Yes! I am, Therman.

01:35:19.893 --> 01:35:23.774
Only this time, I brought
my secret weapon... my brain.

01:35:26.401 --> 01:35:30.349
- What are you talking about?
- He's talking about brain control.

01:35:30.505 --> 01:35:35.079
Brain control?

01:35:35.243 --> 01:35:37.656
There ain't no such thing
as brain control.

01:35:37.813 --> 01:35:41.522
There is mind control.
Brain control is ridiculous.

01:35:41.684 --> 01:35:43.163
That's ridiculous.

01:35:44.353 --> 01:35:45.798
Yes, it's ridiculous.

01:35:45.955 --> 01:35:48.493
- That's ridiculous.
- Barry.

01:35:48.658 --> 01:35:50.433
Barry.

01:35:50.594 --> 01:35:52.938
- Barry.
- Barry.

01:35:53.096 --> 01:35:54.439
- Barry.
- Barry.

01:35:54.598 --> 01:35:56.509
- Barry,
- Barry.

01:35:56.666 --> 01:35:59.614
- What are you doing?
- Oh, my God.

01:35:59.770 --> 01:36:03.274
- It works.
- How are you doing that?

01:36:03.441 --> 01:36:06.115
I am making you say
everything that I say.

01:36:06.277 --> 01:36:07.517
Yeah, but I�m saying it first.

01:36:07.678 --> 01:36:09.555
- Are you?
- Yes!

01:36:09.714 --> 01:36:10.716
Really?

01:36:12.117 --> 01:36:14.654
I am very, very powerful.

01:36:16.021 --> 01:36:19.867
Oh, my gosh.

01:36:27.634 --> 01:36:29.375
Oh!

01:36:36.176 --> 01:36:37.587
- Oh, thank you,
- You're welcome.

01:36:41.148 --> 01:36:42.149
Oh, no!

01:36:43.884 --> 01:36:45.694
Ah!

01:36:53.562 --> 01:36:57.340
Best dinner ever.

01:36:57.500 --> 01:36:59.844
You have no secrets from me.

01:37:00.002 --> 01:37:03.506
Oh, contrary. You have
no secrets from me, Therman.

01:37:03.673 --> 01:37:08.179
I know that after sex, you like
to curl up in the fecal position.

01:37:09.846 --> 01:37:12.690
You cry like a little baby.

01:37:12.849 --> 01:37:15.352
- Martha told you.
- No, she did not.

01:37:15.519 --> 01:37:20.367
I know that you take a Magic Marker
and you draw a face on your penis.

01:37:20.525 --> 01:37:22.869
Is that against the law?
I don't think so.

01:37:23.027 --> 01:37:26.770
And you put a little hat on it
and you call it Sammy.

01:37:26.931 --> 01:37:29.036
Nobody is supposed to know that.

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.080
- And you sing to it.
- You keep your mouth shut!

01:37:38.410 --> 01:37:40.720
That's... That's not
a hundred percent true.

01:37:40.879 --> 01:37:45.727
I know everything! I have
laid eggs inside of your brain.

01:37:45.885 --> 01:37:47.990
Get them out of my head!

01:37:48.154 --> 01:37:51.727
You are no longer in control
of me! I control you!

01:37:51.891 --> 01:37:54.394
And you are under my power.

01:37:54.561 --> 01:37:56.906
I know everything,
Therman.

01:37:58.232 --> 01:38:00.143
And I release you.

01:38:05.139 --> 01:38:07.620
Barry! Barry!

01:38:08.410 --> 01:38:10.253
Yeah!

01:38:10.412 --> 01:38:12.858
I hope that you have all
kept your receipts,

01:38:13.015 --> 01:38:15.325
because you will all be audited.

01:38:19.188 --> 01:38:22.601
He slept with Martha
at my house!

01:38:22.759 --> 01:38:26.138
I was under the bed
the whole time. What an idiot!

01:38:27.930 --> 01:38:31.105
Right? I know!

01:38:31.268 --> 01:38:33.771
We have a little
tradition here at this dinner.

01:38:33.937 --> 01:38:38.317
We give an award to the evening's
most extraordinary person.

01:38:38.475 --> 01:38:41.456
And tonight's winner is
the most extraordinary person

01:38:41.612 --> 01:38:44.822
I have ever met. Our winner:

01:38:44.983 --> 01:38:46.155
Barry!

01:38:46.317 --> 01:38:49.127
Yeah!

01:38:50.121 --> 01:38:52.965
Wow. Wow!

01:38:54.293 --> 01:38:56.466
- We did it!
- Congratulations.

01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:57.664
Thank you.

01:38:57.830 --> 01:39:00.242
I look forward to working
with you, Mr. Conrad.

01:39:00.399 --> 01:39:04.905
Tim, Tim, you did it.
Your guy is amazing.

01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:06.346
Mueller loves him.

01:39:07.307 --> 01:39:08.980
He is amazing.

01:39:09.142 --> 01:39:11.019
- I thought you did such a great job.
- You're the winner?

01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:12.748
- I am, yeah!
- Whatever.

01:39:14.214 --> 01:39:16.717
And he deserves
a hell of a lot better than this.

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:21.355
- They all do.
- What do you mean, exactly?

01:39:21.522 --> 01:39:25.664
Any of you would throw me
under the bus for a bigger bonus.

01:39:25.827 --> 01:39:29.571
And Barry would throw himself
in front of a car to save a mouse...

01:39:29.732 --> 01:39:31.370
...even though it was already dead.

01:39:32.668 --> 01:39:35.512
I have been trying
to play on your team.

01:39:35.671 --> 01:39:39.118
Barry doesn't deserve
that trophy. I do.

01:39:39.274 --> 01:39:42.222
Hold on a second. Tim, I won
this trophy, fair and square.

01:39:42.378 --> 01:39:43.789
Barry, you don't
want that trophy.

01:39:43.947 --> 01:39:46.393
- I've never won a trophy before.
- Yeah, I know, but...

01:39:46.549 --> 01:39:48.028
- You know what? Keep the trophy.
- OK.

01:39:48.184 --> 01:39:49.720
I'm sorry.
What's going on here?

01:39:49.886 --> 01:39:53.460
Well, these people invited us
here to make fun of us.

01:39:53.624 --> 01:39:56.537
This is a contest
for the biggest idiot.

01:39:56.694 --> 01:39:58.196
Which I nailed!

01:39:59.363 --> 01:40:00.967
Wait, wait, wait...

01:40:01.132 --> 01:40:03.374
- You told him?
- I did.

01:40:03.535 --> 01:40:06.379
It seems this contest was fixed.

01:40:06.538 --> 01:40:08.916
I thought you conducted
yourselves honorably.

01:40:09.074 --> 01:40:11.315
No, we do. We do.

01:40:11.476 --> 01:40:15.118
We do. Tim had
a very bright future here,

01:40:15.281 --> 01:40:18.728
but for some reason, he's chosen
to throw his lot in with the losers.

01:40:18.885 --> 01:40:23.732
Scusi. I think I must not have
heard correctly. Did he call us losers?

01:40:23.890 --> 01:40:25.233
He did.

01:40:25.391 --> 01:40:28.635
You insult my honor
at great risk. I will be leaving.

01:40:29.129 --> 01:40:32.076
Count yourself lucky
I have spared your life.

01:40:32.232 --> 01:40:33.404
Yeah!

01:40:38.573 --> 01:40:40.246
- Marco!
- Oh, God.

01:40:40.408 --> 01:40:42.319
So it is a tight you want, is it?

01:40:42.477 --> 01:40:43.922
Well, you shall have your might.

01:40:44.078 --> 01:40:46.684
But on my terms.

01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:55.527
In a world of complete darkness,
the sighted are blind...

01:40:55.691 --> 01:40:58.501
...but the blind can see.

01:41:01.163 --> 01:41:02.165
Oh, God.

01:41:03.266 --> 01:41:05.371
Welcome...

01:41:05.535 --> 01:41:06.536
...to my world.

01:41:07.804 --> 01:41:10.683
I am invisible. Where am I?

01:41:10.841 --> 01:41:14.119
- He's good.
- I am a shadow...

01:41:14.278 --> 01:41:15.951
...with a big knife!

01:41:16.113 --> 01:41:17.956
Simmer down!

01:41:18.115 --> 01:41:20.891
I can smell your fear!

01:41:21.052 --> 01:41:23.362
I think he's gonna kill someone.

01:41:25.858 --> 01:41:27.701
Hey, no! Not the boys!

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:29.567
This has become a fiasco!

01:41:29.728 --> 01:41:31.799
Wait a second, the Swedish
guy who thinks he's a German!

01:41:31.964 --> 01:41:34.968
He's an idiot, too!
Mueller! Whoo!

01:41:35.133 --> 01:41:36.807
This is what you've been
up to all along!

01:41:36.970 --> 01:41:38.540
- No! No!
- You brought me here

01:41:38.705 --> 01:41:39.740
- to make fun with me!
- No...

01:41:39.906 --> 01:41:42.409
I can assure you.
I am no Unterschlagen!

01:41:46.312 --> 01:41:49.317
No, no! Lorenzo, no!

01:41:49.483 --> 01:41:52.555
- Somebody, grab that bird!
- I got it...

01:41:54.255 --> 01:41:55.996
No, no, no!

01:41:56.156 --> 01:41:58.864
It is my wife's favorite finger!
Please get it back now!

01:41:59.026 --> 01:42:01.769
Williams, get the bird!
Somebody kill the bird!

01:42:01.930 --> 01:42:03.375
- They're going to kill my bird!
- It's not his time!

01:42:03.531 --> 01:42:05.602
- It's over there!
- Don't hurt him!

01:42:05.767 --> 01:42:07.906
- Get the bird!
- Parry right, thrust left!

01:42:08.069 --> 01:42:10.345
You want the bird?
You have to kill me first!

01:42:10.505 --> 01:42:12.679
Fight like a blind man!
Kick him in the business center!

01:42:12.842 --> 01:42:14.287
Right here.

01:42:17.713 --> 01:42:18.851
- Oh!
- There's a ire!

01:42:19.015 --> 01:42:22.519
- Oh, come on!
- Grab the vulture!

01:42:22.685 --> 01:42:25.428
Somebody, just let the bird out!
Please! Just let him out!

01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:26.897
Wait, I have an idea.

01:42:27.057 --> 01:42:28.764
Let Lorenzo out!

01:42:28.926 --> 01:42:31.930
You, stop! Don't move
or I'm gonna kill you.

01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:34.068
Allow me.

01:42:39.270 --> 01:42:41.147
There it is!

01:42:44.042 --> 01:42:46.717
Nice!

01:42:48.814 --> 01:42:49.815
Wanna?

01:42:50.983 --> 01:42:53.623
Great dinner!
Let's go get Julie!

01:42:53.786 --> 01:42:56.130
Mein finger!

01:42:59.326 --> 01:43:02.102
Don't you die on me!

01:43:05.465 --> 01:43:07.843
Julie!

01:43:08.001 --> 01:43:10.073
- Julie?
- Julie?

01:43:10.237 --> 01:43:12.239
Julie?

01:43:12.907 --> 01:43:14.284
Tim.

01:43:23.652 --> 01:43:25.928
There's a way to read that
that's actually positive.

01:43:26.088 --> 01:43:29.092
How? How is that positive, Barry?

01:43:30.659 --> 01:43:32.502
"Tim, have a ni... "

01:43:32.661 --> 01:43:34.437
"Hey, Tim, ha... "

01:43:34.597 --> 01:43:36.270
"Have a nice life. "

01:43:37.967 --> 01:43:43.679
- This is my fault, isn't it?
- It's not. it's my fault.

01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.153
I'm the reason this happened,
not you.

01:43:48.312 --> 01:43:51.691
I messed up. You want to hear
something pathetic?

01:43:52.950 --> 01:43:54.520
God, yeah.

01:43:54.685 --> 01:43:56.859
You know why I wanted
that promotion?

01:43:57.022 --> 01:44:00.162
So that Julie would think
that I was good enough for her.

01:44:00.325 --> 01:44:04.330
I'm so stupid. I couldn't believe
that someone so amazing

01:44:04.496 --> 01:44:06.806
would want anything to do
with me. I tried to impress her...

01:44:06.965 --> 01:44:09.913
...with stuff she doesn't care
about, I don't care about.

01:44:11.203 --> 01:44:14.150
You know what
I care about? Her.

01:44:15.307 --> 01:44:16.809
And what else?

01:44:16.976 --> 01:44:20.652
Waking up next to her every day,
seeing her every day.

01:44:20.814 --> 01:44:22.418
And more things?

01:44:22.582 --> 01:44:27.258
She's the greatest thing in my life
and I blew it. God, I'm an idiot.

01:44:30.824 --> 01:44:31.997
What are you doing?

01:44:40.168 --> 01:44:41.841
Did you know I was listening?

01:44:42.003 --> 01:44:45.213
- No.
- I did. I did.

01:44:48.577 --> 01:44:51.456
I... I thought you'd gone.

01:44:51.613 --> 01:44:54.457
I left my phone.

01:44:55.852 --> 01:44:58.731
Julie... I'm...

01:44:58.888 --> 01:45:01.232
Julie?

01:45:02.525 --> 01:45:04.527
We should hurry if we're
gonna catch that plane.

01:45:05.962 --> 01:45:10.571
- Kieran...
- Julie, I will handle this.

01:45:13.204 --> 01:45:16.617
Kieran...
since the dawn of ancient times,

01:45:16.774 --> 01:45:20.086
men and women have striven
to End the perfect mate.

01:45:20.245 --> 01:45:22.885
And once in a while,
a couple will meet

01:45:23.048 --> 01:45:25.790
and spark a passion
that is so powerful,

01:45:25.951 --> 01:45:29.900
a thousand armies
could not pull them apart.

01:45:30.056 --> 01:45:32.229
That is what you have with Julie.

01:45:33.059 --> 01:45:34.800
But Tim got there first.

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:37.339
And if Julie leaves,
it will kill him.

01:45:38.798 --> 01:45:41.245
People can die of broken hearts.

01:45:41.401 --> 01:45:44.507
I know. It almost happened to me.

01:45:44.671 --> 01:45:50.144
And because of that...
you may see Julie no more.

01:45:50.978 --> 01:45:54.085
You may talk to Julie no more.

01:45:54.249 --> 01:45:59.358
You may look upon
Julie's face... no more.

01:45:59.521 --> 01:46:02.263
OK, but we work together, so...

01:46:02.423 --> 01:46:04.836
What part of "no more"
do you not understand?

01:46:04.994 --> 01:46:06.268
We had a talk, Kieran and I,

01:46:06.428 --> 01:46:09.272
and he understands
it's purely professional.

01:46:09.431 --> 01:46:13.675
- There is professional no more.
- He's right, Julie.

01:46:15.104 --> 01:46:20.179
If we start this tire...
we'll burn this world to ashes.

01:46:20.343 --> 01:46:22.289
What are you talking about?

01:46:22.445 --> 01:46:24.391
"If you start this tire... "

01:46:26.616 --> 01:46:29.621
- Burn it to ashes.
- "... burn this world to ashes. "

01:46:31.122 --> 01:46:35.127
- There goes my museum show.
- Welcome to my world.

01:46:35.293 --> 01:46:38.740
- Yeah.
- Julie...

01:46:38.896 --> 01:46:41.468
...I love you. I don't care
if we get married.

01:46:41.633 --> 01:46:42.668
Rn stop asking

01:46:44.469 --> 01:46:46.005
Don't stop asking.

01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:03.267
You are a wise man, my friend.

01:47:03.424 --> 01:47:05.199
As are you.

01:47:14.335 --> 01:47:17.340
Au revoir, Julie.
Au revoir, Tim.

01:47:17.505 --> 01:47:19.746
Au revoir, Kieran.

01:47:21.776 --> 01:47:24.723
Be kind to your birds
and your goats.

01:47:38.795 --> 01:47:41.867
We're gonna be
so happy together.

01:47:49.641 --> 01:47:52.884
I guess things
really do happen for a reason.

01:47:53.044 --> 01:47:55.718
Tim lost his job, but the two of us
remain best friends.

01:47:55.880 --> 01:47:59.987
And once a month, I invite him
to a gathering I host.

01:48:00.151 --> 01:48:03.497
It's called
"The Breakfast of Champions. "

01:48:05.257 --> 01:48:07.237
Kieran and I became friends.

01:48:07.393 --> 01:48:11.398
He asked me to collaborate with him and
we showed our work all over the world..

01:48:11.563 --> 01:48:13.976
...including South Africa.

01:48:14.134 --> 01:48:16.136
And guess who came to see us?

01:48:16.303 --> 01:48:17.907
Morgan Freeman.

01:48:21.241 --> 01:48:24.519
Tim went on to help Martin Mueller
convert his munitions factory

01:48:24.679 --> 01:48:27.091
into the Martin Mueller
Museum of Modem Art...

01:48:27.248 --> 01:48:30.092
...or 'mmm-ah. "

01:48:31.585 --> 01:48:34.998
Kieran and I collaborated
on a sculpture for the opening.

01:48:40.462 --> 01:48:44.274
I met up with Dana again.
Boy, does she like role-playing.

01:48:44.433 --> 01:48:48.007
She had me play detective
and she left all of these clues.

01:48:48.171 --> 01:48:51.880
And you know what?
I found it.

01:48:55.278 --> 01:48:57.121
Therman wrote a new book,

01:48:57.280 --> 01:48:59.887
and it is very popular
in some circles.

01:49:01.452 --> 01:49:03.295
I guess it's true what they say

01:49:03.454 --> 01:49:05.695
'71 mind is a terrible thing. "

01:49:09.993 --> 01:49:14.465
Oh, yeah, as for Tim and Julie...
Well, Julie finally said yes.

01:49:14.632 --> 01:49:16.908
They went to Paris
for the honeymoon.

01:49:17.068 --> 01:49:21.141
I waited around to surprise them,
but it never felt like the right time.

01:49:22.574 --> 01:49:24.486
Anyway, I can tell you this:
