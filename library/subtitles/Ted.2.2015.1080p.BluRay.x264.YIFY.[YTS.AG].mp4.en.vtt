smoked pot for two
whole days, right?

483
00:23:58.812 --> 00:24:01.406
Yes, I told you, I'm clean, all right?
Your baby's gonna be fine.

484
00:24:01.523 --> 00:24:03.366
I'm sorry, I just
don't want something

485
00:24:03.442 --> 00:24:05.865

You're missing out on a great guy.

a lube or something?
A magazine?

use urinal four,

627
00:29:57.462 --> 00:29:59.009

there's the question

628

and,honestly, it's the
more serious one.

633
00:30:10.642 --> 00:30:12.895
I was reluctant to
bring it up because

634
00:30:14.187 --> 00:30:15.689
it's a little awkward.

635
00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:20.531
Ted, in the eyes of the
state, you are not a person.

636

Wait, what?

637
00:30:24.406 --> 00:30:26.625
The state official
I spoke to said

638
00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.829
that technically, you are
classified as property.

639

What do you mean, "Be careful"?

650
00:30:53.226 --> 00:30:55.194
The state official I spoke to

651
00:30:55.270 --> 00:30:58.900
made it sound like your status had
gone under the radar for some time.

652
00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:02.115
Your adoption request may
have raised some red flags.

653
00:31:02.694 --> 00:31:05.447
If they choose to
investigate the issue,

654
00:31:05.614 --> 00:31:08.163
it may leave you
quite vulnerable.

655
00:31:21.296 --> 00:31:23.765
Hey. I just got off work
and heard your message.

656
00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:25.467
Is that for real? Did they
actually tell you that?

657
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.268
Yeah, it's unbelievable.
"Property."

658
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.062
They said I'm property.

659
00:31:29.304 --> 00:31:31.227
What does that even mean?
Like, you're a thing?

660
00:31:31.306 --> 00:31:33.149
What, like garbage
or a piece of shit?

661
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.070
I mean, maybe more like a
hammer or an orange, but yeah.

662
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.362
What the hell
do they know?

663
00:31:38.438 --> 00:31:39.485
It's just a word.

664
00:31:39.564 --> 00:31:41.942
They can't change your whole life
just by calling you property!

665
00:31:42.025 --> 00:31:44.949

You better ask my ancestors.

and I've hired her on as a junior
associate here at the firm.

a bad back, bitch!

981
00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:20.615
What do you think
that was about?

982
00:46:20.903 --> 00:46:22.951
Oh, it's nothing. That's his way
of saying I should ask you out.

983
00:46:23.030 --> 00:46:24.077
Ah.

984
00:46:24.156 --> 00:46:25.248
Uh, yeah, look...

985
00:46:25.324 --> 00:46:27.952
We should probably focus our
attention on the case for now.

986
00:46:28.035 --> 00:46:29.662
I completely agree.

987
00:46:30.705 --> 00:46:34.801
You know, l am a little bit curious.
How is it that a guy like you is unattached?

988
00:46:35.918 --> 00:46:40.389
Well, I was married at one point,
but it just didn't work out.

989
00:46:40.548 --> 00:46:42.721
Shits. I'm sorry. That sucks.

990
00:46:42.883 --> 00:46:46.353
No. I mean, we'd make
it work day to day,

991
00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.431
but she was always
just trying to change me

992
00:46:48.514 --> 00:46:49.731
into someone I'm not.

993
00:46:49.890 --> 00:46:51.608
And I tried, you know?

994
00:46:52.435 --> 00:46:55.905
I really tried everything I could
to be the man that she wanted.

995
00:46:56.397 --> 00:46:59.992
One day I woke up and I just
realized I wasn't myself anymore.

996
00:47:00.818 --> 00:47:04.914
You know, as much as I love this person,
we're completely wrong for each other.

997
00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:07.829
At least you
figured it out early.

998
00:47:08.117 --> 00:47:09.664
Some people go through
their whole lives

999
00:47:09.744 --> 00:47:11.587

with the wrong person.

1000
00:47:12.163 --> 00:47:13.415
Yeah.

1001
00:47:14.707 --> 00:47:16.129
So, we're gonna
win this thing?

1002
00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:18.461
Honestly, I don't know.

1003

Oh, we're betting on you.

We got to get up there.

That is why we've been working so hard.
That's Shep Wild.

It's our bad luck
they put him on the trial.

1035
00:49:05.025 --> 00:49:06.823
He's never lost
a case in his life.

1037
00:49:11.449 --> 00:49:12.826
Thank you, Your Honor.

1038
00:49:13.742 --> 00:49:16.541
I would first like to thank the
ladies and gentlemen of the jury

1039
00:49:16.912 --> 00:49:19.711
for taking time out
of their busy schedules

1040
00:49:20.124 --> 00:49:21.967
to be a part of
these proceedings.

1041
00:49:22.418 --> 00:49:27.640
Now, the case we'll be examining
today is really quite a simple one.

1042
00:49:28.007 --> 00:49:30.260
Is Ted a human being?

1043
00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:32.311
Or a piece of property?

1044
00:49:33.137 --> 00:49:38.940
You know, it really is a very special,
very unique thing to be human.

1045
00:49:39.643 --> 00:49:43.523
It's a gift from God bestowed
upon only one species.

1046
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:45.028
Us.

1047
00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:48.448
But if we suddenly decide
to share that gift,

1048
00:49:49.445 --> 00:49:50.913
where does that lead us?

1049
00:49:51.572 --> 00:49:53.574
Does your dog
deserve human rights?

1050
00:49:54.074 --> 00:49:55.371

seem so special anymore, does it?

I'm confident you'll
make the right decision.

Well, not because I'm a junior
attorney arguing her first case.

1063
00:50:35.282 --> 00:50:36.875
And not because
some of you might laugh

1064

I'm representing a teddy bear.

going to be swayed

1069
00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:59.224
by smooth talk
and a haircut,

1070
00:50:59.473 --> 00:51:03.603
and forget about the most
important aspect of this case.

1071
00:51:04.979 --> 00:51:06.151
Justice.

1072
00:51:07.898 --> 00:51:09.275
A hundred
and fifty years ago

1073
00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.744
a slave by the
name of Dred Scott

1074
00:51:11.819 --> 00:51:15.414
sued to prove that he was a person
and not a piece of property.

1075
00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:17.332
He lost.

1076
00:51:17.575 --> 00:51:21.580
And as history has shown
us, that wasn’t justice.

1077
00:51:23.872 --> 00:51:26.546
In every
civil rights conflict,

1078
00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:31.259
we are only able to recognize
the just point of view

1079
00:51:31.338 --> 00:51:33.181
years after the fact.

1080
00:51:33.674 --> 00:51:35.847
And when the next
conflict comes along,

1081
00:51:36.010 --> 00:51:39.014
we're once again blind
to it as it's happening.

1082
00:51:40.014 --> 00:51:43.439
"Well, this is different,"
we say, but it isn't.

1083
00:51:44.602 --> 00:51:47.776
It is the same beast, just
wearing a different face,

1084
00:51:47.855 --> 00:51:49.482
and it's happening
again today.

1085
00:51:51.025 --> 00:51:54.245
So I urge you, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

1086
00:51:54.403 --> 00:51:57.532
not to be a footnote
on the wrong side of history.

1087

to be right.

why did you not choose to
have a child of your own?

1308

a Veterans Day parade,

1313

Very sad for the family.

You know what? If anyone can get
this verdict overturned, it's him.

1318

a high profile case,

1319
01:02:08.308 --> 01:02:10.561
I feel like he might
take it pro Bono.

1320

if, um, maybe you would consider helping
us try to overturn the verdict.

1332

Well, yeah. I mean, it would
have to be a pro Bono situation

1333

because we're not really
working with much money.

Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Hey! Come on.
That's Star Trek!

1618
01:18:53.187 --> 01:18:54.404
Yeah, that's two
different franchises.

1619
01:18:54.563 --> 01:18:56.110
Yeah, sorry, guys.
She doesn't know.

1620
01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:58.568
Nah, it's okay. I'm sorry
you have to deal with that.

1621
01:18:59.443 --> 01:19:00.990
All right, let's go.

1622
01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:03.911
Oh, hey, come on.
It's not worth it, man.

1623
01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.582
- Come on.
- It's not worth it, not worth it.

1625
01:19:23.759 --> 01:19:26.387
This Patrick Meighan's
got a classy setup, huh?

1626
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:27.517
Mmm.

1627
01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:34.854
And there is our
first impression.

1628
01:19:35.354 --> 01:19:37.356
Ms. Jackson?
Mr. Meighan will see you now.

1629
01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:39.032
Oh, okay. Thank you.

1630
01:19:45.739 --> 01:19:48.117
Ah, Ms. Jackson. Do come in.

1631
01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:50.544
Mr. Meighan,
this is such an honor.

1632
01:19:50.703 --> 01:19:52.296
Thank you so much
for meeting with us.

1633
01:19:52.371 --> 01:19:54.624
Not at all. It's my pleasure.
Please, sit down.

1634
01:19:54.832 --> 01:19:56.960
Oh, this office is
fucking awesome.

1635
01:19:57.042 --> 01:19:58.965
Yeah, totally. Hey, hey.

1636
01:19:59.211 --> 01:20:00.463
Hey! You ever bring chicks up here?

1637
01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:02.552
What do you think?

1638
01:20:02.798 --> 01:20:05.893
I think I want to sleep on
a bed made of your voice.

1639
01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:09.021
I'll get right down to it.

1640
01:20:09.305 --> 01:20:11.103
I don't want to waste
too much of your time.

1641
01:20:12.891 --> 01:20:15.735
Ted, I've been
reviewing your file.

1642
01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:18.318
And while I'm sympathetic
to your cause,

1643
01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:21.617
I'm sorry to say
I won't be taking your case.

1644
01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:22.826
- What?
- Why?

1645
01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:23.902
Why not?

1646
01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:25.826
Well, it comes down to this.

1647
01:20:27.906 --> 01:20:30.705
You want to be human
in the eyes of the law.

1648
01:20:31.035 --> 01:20:33.413
That's a hard sell,
even for me.

1649
01:20:33.912 --> 01:20:36.335
See, the important
thing about being human

1650
01:20:36.415 --> 01:20:38.793
is making a contribution
to society.

1651
01:20:38.876 --> 01:20:41.254
Assisting in
the betterment of your race.

1652
01:20:41.628 --> 01:20:43.426
You've done none of that.

1653
01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.216
I've read about your life.

1654
01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:48.556
The drugs, the parties,
the prostitutes, the arrests.

1655
01:20:48.635 --> 01:20:51.058
Mr. Meighan, we've come
a long way to meet you

1656
01:20:51.138 --> 01:20:52.765
because you said
that you could help us.

1657
01:20:53.098 --> 01:20:55.021
I said I would consider it.

1658
01:20:55.601 --> 01:20:56.944
And I have.

1659
01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.614
Ted, you're special.

1660
01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:03.317
You could've been
an inspiration to the world.

1661
01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:05.657
Could've been a leader,
a role model.

1662
01:21:06.612 --> 01:21:08.239
Instead you're...

1663
01:21:09.114 --> 01:21:10.286
Justin Bieber.

1664
01:21:10.824 --> 01:21:11.825
Fuck you!

1665
01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:13.202
- Hey, Ted! Come on!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1666
01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:15.287
- He doesn't mean that.
- Please forgive me, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1667
01:21:15.454 --> 01:21:16.751
There's just no indication

1668
01:21:16.830 --> 01:21:19.754
that you've had any positive
effect on the world around you.

1669
01:21:19.917 --> 01:21:22.591
Well, that's not true.
He's had a positive effect on me.

1670
01:21:22.753 --> 01:21:25.632
Would that positive effect
be your joint arrest

1671
01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:28.058
for purchasing
marijuana in 2003?

1672
01:21:28.133 --> 01:21:30.852
Well, how the fuck do you prepare
for a Foo Fighters concert?

1673
01:21:32.679 --> 01:21:34.727
You know why
you lost this case?

1674
01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:38.310
It can't be argued by reason.

1675
01:21:38.685 --> 01:21:41.814
The precedent it sets would
affect the public directly.

1676
01:21:42.022 --> 01:21:45.276
And unfortunately, the public
doesn’t judge by reason.

1677
01:21:45.359 --> 01:21:47.578
It judges by emotion.

1678
01:21:48.946 --> 01:21:51.790
And you can't appeal
an emotional conviction.

1679
01:21:52.199 --> 01:21:55.669
Nonetheless, I wish you all
the best in your efforts.

1680
01:21:57.996 --> 01:21:59.498
He needs help.

1681
01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.500
And from what
I know about you,

1682
01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:04.045
at one point in your career
that would've been enough.

1683
01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:08.345
I'm sorry you're not
who I hoped you'd be.

1684
01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:18.900
Are those Tootsie Rolls
just, like, to take?

1685
01:22:21.019 --> 01:22:23.238
Those aren't
supposed to be out.

1686
01:22:34.366 --> 01:22:36.414
So that's it.
I'm property.

1687
01:22:37.202 --> 01:22:39.079
No rights, no nothing.

1688
01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:42.709
Ted,dude, I'm so sorry, man.
This completely sucks.

1689
01:22:43.083 --> 01:22:44.551
I feel terrible.

1690
01:22:45.169 --> 01:22:47.046
I let you guys down
all over again.

1691
01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:50.391
Hey. You didn't let us down, Sam.
You did your best.

1692
01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:53.185
And, look, regardless
of all this shit,

1693
01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.854
you're still the best thing that's
happened to me in a long time.

1694
01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:03.061
Oh. Oh, that...

1695
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:04.396
That's great!
That's fucking great!

1696
01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:05.527
I'm glad you guys
are so happy!

1697
01:23:05.606 --> 01:23:06.653
What?

1698
01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:08.700
What do you mean, "What?"
I'm totally screwed here.

1699
01:23:08.775 --> 01:23:11.278
And you're sitting there
basically banging my lawyer,

1700
01:23:11.361 --> 01:23:13.034
and she's probably
still fucking billing us!

1701
01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:15.207
Well, don't yell at us, dude!
We didn't do anything!

1702
01:23:15.365 --> 01:23:16.662
Yeah, exactly! Exactly!

1703
01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:19.837
Maybe if you guys had spent a little
less time mooning over each other,

1704
01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:22.756
Sam could've won this thing and
I wouldn't be a fucking thing!

1705
01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:25.004
Like garbage or
a piece of shit!

1706
01:23:25.459 --> 01:23:27.803
Hey, we've been fighting right
alongside you the whole way.

1707
01:23:27.878 --> 01:23:28.925
And remember,
you're the one

1708
01:23:29.004 --> 01:23:30.005
who's been pushing me
to get back on the horse.

1709
01:23:30.088 --> 01:23:32.011
I finally meet someone and
you're giving me shit for it?

1710
01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:33.683
Oh, no, you're right.
No, Johnny, it's fine.

1711
01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:34.851
You're right, it's fine.
It's totally fine.

1712
01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:37.350
I got no job,
no marriage and no life!

1713
01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:40.524
But you have fun porking Gollum
here, while I'm left with shit!

Who's Gollum?

1716
01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.108
She's a model.

personhood include self-awareness,

2099
01:45:03.214 --> 01:45:06.388
an ability to understand
complex emotions

2100
01:45:06.717 --> 01:45:09.266
and a capacity for empathy.

2101
01:45:11.096 --> 01:45:16.068
We're all in agreement
that Ted is self-aware.

Ted Clubber Lang.

2104
01:45:26.487 --> 01:45:29.957
As for complex emotions
and the capacity for empathy,

2105
01:45:30.699 --> 01:45:32.952
we all saw
the distressing images

2106

over his fallen friend,

2107
01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:37.043

2108
01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.213
In those images,

2109
01:45:39.333 --> 01:45:44.385
Ted exhibits all of the remaining
qualities of personhood.

2110
01:45:46.507 --> 01:45:48.885
It's right there
for anyone to see.

2111
01:45:50.094 --> 01:45:54.474
And I believe that a just
court must, by definition,

2112
01:45:55.307 --> 01:45:59.153
