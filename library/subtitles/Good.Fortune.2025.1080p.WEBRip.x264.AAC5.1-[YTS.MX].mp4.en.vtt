WEBVTT

00:01:34.828 --> 00:01:35.828
Oh, shit!

00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:44.438
Oh, fuck!

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:23.543
This the line
for There Will Be Buns?

00:02:23.544 --> 00:02:25.378
You know it.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.013
Any idea how long
the wait's supposed to be?

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:29.516
Uh, they said
about two hours.

00:02:29.517 --> 00:02:31.918
Wow. That's a long time
to wait for cinnamon buns.

00:02:31.919 --> 00:02:33.720
Is this your first bun?
They're incredible.

00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:35.588
I'm actually not
that big on sweets.

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:37.358
Then why are you here?

00:02:38.226 --> 00:02:40.092
Oh, I'm on TaskSergeant.

00:02:40.093 --> 00:02:42.595
I'm actually getting paid to
wait in line for someone else.

00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:43.964
Hmm, that...

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:46.199
sucks ass.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.334
Did you go to college?

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:49.669
Uh, yeah, I went to college.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:51.438
Then why are you
a laundryman?

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:53.873
I'm not a laundryman.
I'm doing TaskSergeant.

00:02:53.874 --> 00:02:56.509
Did you not do good
in college?

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.045
Hey. Yeah, I'm still
waiting on those buns.

00:02:59.046 --> 00:03:01.013
They said it should probably
be another hour.

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.215
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:03.616
I want to be an archeologist.

00:03:03.617 --> 00:03:05.051
You want me to tell you
how that's going to go?

00:03:05.052 --> 00:03:06.619
You're going
to major in archeology,

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.954
and then you're going
to get out

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.757
and there's going to be
no archeology jobs.

00:03:10.758 --> 00:03:12.058
I've been an adult
a long time.

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:13.926
You know how many
archeologists I've met?

00:03:13.927 --> 00:03:14.995
Zero.

00:03:16.964 --> 00:03:18.899
Okay, Arnold, meet...

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:20.900
your new desk.

00:03:20.901 --> 00:03:23.636
So now you got no job,
a useless degree,

00:03:23.637 --> 00:03:24.937
and a ton of debt.

00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.273
What happens then?

00:03:26.274 --> 00:03:28.975
Well, I hope you like it here,
'cause guess what?

00:03:28.976 --> 00:03:30.076
You're moving back home!

00:03:30.077 --> 00:03:31.578
You need some money.

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:33.280
So you start
doing TaskSergeant.

00:03:33.281 --> 00:03:35.382
You take every part-time gig
you can get.

00:03:35.383 --> 00:03:36.716
You're working all the time.

00:03:36.717 --> 00:03:38.385
But you never have enough.

00:03:38.386 --> 00:03:40.253
I know you got
a lot of big hopes.

00:03:40.254 --> 00:03:42.121
I used to be
a little Indian kid, too.

00:03:42.122 --> 00:03:44.291
But I got news for you,
little man.

00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:48.160
The American dream is dead.

00:03:50.398 --> 00:03:52.732
Yeah, I probably shouldn't
have said that stuff.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.601
So sorry, guys.

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:57.304
- All out for the day.
- What?

00:03:57.305 --> 00:04:00.340
I'm going to fuck this place
with one star.

00:04:00.341 --> 00:04:03.810
Hey, it's Arj
from TaskSergeant.

00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:08.014
Uh, I'm so sorry,
they actually sold out of buns.

00:04:08.015 --> 00:04:09.449
Yeah, you won't get charged
for the buns,

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.651
but please don't
cancel the task.

00:04:11.652 --> 00:04:12.985
'Cause then I don't get paid,

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:15.355
and, you know, I did
wait, like, two hours.

00:04:15.356 --> 00:04:18.591
Okay. Thanks
for understanding. Bye.

00:04:18.592 --> 00:04:20.327
- There are my buns!
- Hey.

00:04:20.328 --> 00:04:22.329
Yo. Thank you so much.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.130
- Sure.
- Ooh. The bag's still warm.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:27.334
- Love it. See you soon.
- See ya.

00:04:27.335 --> 00:04:29.035
Who's that guy?
How'd he get some buns?

00:04:29.036 --> 00:04:30.803
He's one of our investors.

00:04:34.575 --> 00:04:35.675
Canceled?

00:04:35.676 --> 00:04:37.644
You said you weren't
going to do that!

00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:38.978
Goddamn it, David H!

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.881
Fuck my life.

00:04:56.196 --> 00:04:59.532
Hey. Can I talk
to you for a second?

00:04:59.533 --> 00:05:01.634
- Sure.
- Elena from lumber.

00:05:01.635 --> 00:05:03.235
Arj, floor associate.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:06.005
Sometimes power tools.

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:08.609
Are you happy with
the work environment here?

00:05:09.543 --> 00:05:10.577
No.

00:05:10.578 --> 00:05:12.545
Exactly.

00:05:12.546 --> 00:05:14.681
I mean, we know they can do
so much better here,

00:05:14.682 --> 00:05:17.384
and that's why
I'm trying to start a union.

00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:18.851
I'm just
working here part-time

00:05:18.852 --> 00:05:21.187
- to save some money
and then I'm moving on.
- Okay.

00:05:21.188 --> 00:05:22.755
Well, just because you're not
going to be somewhere forever

00:05:22.756 --> 00:05:24.625
doesn't mean
you can't make it better.

00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:26.860
Nothing ever changes.

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:29.396
So what's your answer?

00:05:29.397 --> 00:05:30.598
Give up?

00:05:31.799 --> 00:05:34.201
- I don't have an answer.
- Hmm.

00:05:35.836 --> 00:05:40.474
Okay, Arj, floor associate,

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:43.544
best of luck to you.

00:05:49.683 --> 00:05:50.684
Thank you.

00:05:52.753 --> 00:05:55.221
Smelling good.

00:05:55.222 --> 00:05:58.791
Oh. You guys are
out of suadero. Damn!

00:05:58.792 --> 00:06:00.359
Suadero's my jam.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.596
Um, okay.
Have a good night.

00:06:03.597 --> 00:06:06.299
Hey. I got four.
You want some of mine?

00:06:07.668 --> 00:06:08.735
- Yeah.
- All right.

00:06:08.736 --> 00:06:11.037
Come over here,
Elena from lumber.

00:06:11.038 --> 00:06:13.039
- You cool with these fixings?
- I am.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.273
I went a little heavy
on the green sauce.

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:16.443
- Is that okay?
- That's always good.

00:06:16.444 --> 00:06:18.911
So how you been sleeping, man?
You look a little tired.

00:06:18.912 --> 00:06:20.947
Wow, thanks for noticing.

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:22.214
It's a new look
I'm going for.

00:06:22.215 --> 00:06:23.583
Sorry.

00:06:23.584 --> 00:06:25.552
Uh, no, I haven't been
sleeping that well.

00:06:25.553 --> 00:06:27.754
- You got any tips?
- Actually, I do.

00:06:27.755 --> 00:06:29.088
I've been using
sleep stories

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:30.457
- on my phone.
- Oh.

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:31.891
Pretty much I just
listen to this guy talk,

00:06:31.892 --> 00:06:33.560
and he's so boring
that I just knock out.

00:06:33.561 --> 00:06:35.394
- I gotta give it a try.
- Works every time.

00:06:35.395 --> 00:06:37.164
So what do you do all day
when you're so well-rested?

00:06:38.466 --> 00:06:39.899
- I make furniture.
- Oh.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.601
Yeah, that's why I started
working at Hardware Heaven

00:06:41.602 --> 00:06:43.135
so I can get some
of those discounts.

00:06:43.136 --> 00:06:44.504
- Mmm.
- What about you?

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:45.605
What do you do?

00:06:45.606 --> 00:06:46.973
Um, I'm an editor.

00:06:46.974 --> 00:06:49.308
I edit documentaries,
things like that.

00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:51.310
I love documentaries.
What you working on now?

00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.646
Right now, I'm just
doing freelance stuff.

00:06:53.647 --> 00:06:55.515
I'm hoping to get
another proper gig soon.

00:06:55.516 --> 00:06:57.750
You'll get another one.
Keep your dreams alive.

00:06:57.751 --> 00:06:58.918
I once dated a girl

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.419
that had that tattooed
on her lower back.

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:01.654
Oh, yeah?
Where is she now?

00:07:01.655 --> 00:07:03.055
I think
she's dating this DJ.

00:07:03.056 --> 00:07:05.658
Elena,
with the cinnamon bun guy?

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.494
Have you
ever been to a rave?

00:07:07.495 --> 00:07:09.328
- No, I haven't.
- Don't take the drugs.

00:07:09.329 --> 00:07:11.030
I think I'll just
take the drugs

00:07:11.031 --> 00:07:12.665
and just not go to the rave.

00:07:12.666 --> 00:07:14.934
- What about that option?
- Love that.

00:07:35.022 --> 00:07:36.924
Hey,
how is the new apartment?

00:07:38.125 --> 00:07:41.060
Um, it's cozy.

00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:44.531
Great, great. I was
talking to Ayesha Auntie.

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:48.367
Your little cousin Naveen
got a really good job
with Microsoft.

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:50.637
He's making lot of money.

00:07:50.638 --> 00:07:52.238
Good for Naveen.

00:07:52.239 --> 00:07:55.708
Maybe he can help you
to get a job.

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:57.844
I'm an editor.
I work on documentaries.

00:07:57.845 --> 00:08:00.179
What am I going
to do at Microsoft?

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.650
Maybe you can do a documentary
about Naveen.

00:08:03.651 --> 00:08:07.887
He's very smart,
successful, well-dressed.

00:08:07.888 --> 00:08:10.624
Okay. Um, well,
I'll think about it.

00:08:13.060 --> 00:08:15.394

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:53.901
All right. Everyone,
let's gather around.

00:09:09.783 --> 00:09:12.952
And there he was,
this lost soul,

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:14.887
his head in his hands,

00:09:14.888 --> 00:09:18.759
about to jump headfirst
into Niagara Falls.

00:09:19.827 --> 00:09:22.294
As he lurked over the edge,

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:24.764
panic filled his eyes
as he thought,

00:09:24.765 --> 00:09:28.801
"Oh, no. Is this the end?"

00:09:28.802 --> 00:09:31.771
I put my arm on his shoulder
and said,

00:09:31.772 --> 00:09:34.406
"Kenneth, I'm an angel.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:38.010
"My name is Azrael.
I'm here to save you."

00:09:38.011 --> 00:09:41.648
I showed him
what he had to live for.

00:09:41.649 --> 00:09:45.618
Visions that reflected
the hope his life promised.

00:09:45.619 --> 00:09:48.154
Cheering his son
at a soccer game,

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:52.124
holding his wife on the couch
on a lazy Sunday,

00:09:52.125 --> 00:09:54.695
playing in the park
with his dog...

00:09:55.996 --> 00:09:58.330
Shoelace.

00:09:58.331 --> 00:10:02.301
"I see now that my life
was precious as it was.

00:10:02.302 --> 00:10:05.337
"Thank you
for showing me my path.

00:10:05.338 --> 00:10:08.540
"You are a special angel."

00:10:12.379 --> 00:10:14.113
Martha?

00:10:14.114 --> 00:10:15.815
Yes, Gabriel.

00:10:15.816 --> 00:10:19.618
Is there any way I can
have more meaningful
duties like Azrael?

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:21.353
I want to guide people,

00:10:21.354 --> 00:10:24.758
I want to change their lives,
I want to save a lost soul.

00:10:26.226 --> 00:10:30.296
To save a lost soul,
you have to find a lost soul.

00:10:30.297 --> 00:10:32.799
Finding a lost soul
is not easy, Gabriel.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.501
And showing them a path is...

00:10:35.502 --> 00:10:37.203
Is incredibly difficult.

00:10:37.204 --> 00:10:40.873
But I saw a person today.
His job is waiting in line.

00:10:40.874 --> 00:10:42.809
He's ready to give up
on his life.

00:10:42.810 --> 00:10:46.212
But that's not your task,
is it, Gabriel?

00:10:46.213 --> 00:10:48.180
How's the texting
and driving going?

00:10:48.181 --> 00:10:52.151
It's a lot.
People really love doing it.

00:10:52.152 --> 00:10:53.986
What do you have this week?

00:10:53.987 --> 00:10:56.422
Um, I'm supposed to save
a woman named Elena,

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:58.490
who works at a place
called Hardware Heaven.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.694
She almost backs
into a telephone pole.

00:11:01.695 --> 00:11:03.730
But you're not going to let
that happen, are you?

00:11:03.731 --> 00:11:05.865
No, I'm not.

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.100
One step at a time.

00:11:14.507 --> 00:11:16.043
Yeah. Uh...

00:11:19.179 --> 00:11:22.716
Customer service

00:11:24.217 --> 00:11:25.985

I know. I was just
about to go get some groceries.

00:11:34.694 --> 00:11:37.563
Really? Looks like
you covered up your windows
and went to sleep.

00:11:37.564 --> 00:11:38.965
I know that's what
it looks like, but...

00:11:38.966 --> 00:11:41.067
Don't let me catch you
out here again.

00:11:41.068 --> 00:11:42.468
Okay.

Yo, Arj, my Indian brother.
What's going on, man?

00:12:02.155 --> 00:12:03.956
Hey, what's up, Leonard?

00:12:03.957 --> 00:12:06.292
You know, you don't have
to mention I'm Indian
every time you say hi.

00:12:06.293 --> 00:12:08.260
Oh, my bad.
You Pakistani?

00:12:08.261 --> 00:12:10.162
Just forget about it.

00:12:10.163 --> 00:12:12.431
- Uh, you good?
- Yo, quick favor.

00:12:12.432 --> 00:12:15.001
You got some toothpaste
I could borrow? I'm all out.

00:12:15.002 --> 00:12:16.735
Uh, yeah.

00:12:16.736 --> 00:12:18.504
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

00:12:18.505 --> 00:12:20.807
Oh, you don't have the one
with the little whitening
crystals, do you?

00:12:20.808 --> 00:12:22.274
I got a big date tonight.

00:12:22.275 --> 00:12:24.110
No, sorry. What's up
with this big date?

00:12:24.111 --> 00:12:28.247
Oh, yo, this girl Susan,
she works at the CVS
up in Burbank.

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:31.818
I asked, I said,
"Yo, why you smell
like blueberries?"

00:12:31.819 --> 00:12:33.319
And now,
we're going on a date.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.753
- That worked?
- Hell, yeah.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:37.589
Dude, girls love it
when you know smells.

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:39.826
That shows you notice things.
Try it.

00:12:39.827 --> 00:12:43.762
Go up to a girl
and be like, "Yo, girl,
you smell like a new car."

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.098
'Cause that's
everyone's favorite smell.

00:12:46.099 --> 00:12:47.934
Well, why didn't you tell Susan
she smelled like a new car?

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:51.503
'Cause she smelled
like blueberries.

00:12:51.504 --> 00:12:53.840
Yep, that makes sense.
I'll see you later, Leonard.

00:12:53.841 --> 00:12:55.274
Just give me
the toothpaste tomorrow.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.543

Arj?

00:13:50.263 --> 00:13:51.830
Uh, yeah. I'm here
to clean out the garage.

00:13:51.831 --> 00:13:54.000
Nice, nice.
I'm Jeff. A plej.

00:13:54.001 --> 00:13:55.234
Wait.

00:13:55.235 --> 00:13:56.936
Were you at There Will Be Buns
the other day?

00:13:56.937 --> 00:13:58.337
Yeah, love that place.

00:13:58.338 --> 00:14:00.439
- Line's pretty
brutal though, huh?
- I hope so.

00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.441
I'm an investor,
so we likes a long line.

00:14:02.442 --> 00:14:04.376
My buddy, David Haberman,
you know what he does?

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:07.013
He pays a guy to wait in line
for him. You should try that.

00:14:07.014 --> 00:14:09.048
Mmm. That's a good idea.

00:14:09.049 --> 00:14:11.383
Garage is this way. How long
you been doing TaskSergeant?

00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:13.085
Uh, a few months.

00:14:13.086 --> 00:14:15.187
Oh, got to say, they've
been a lifesaver for me.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.589
My assistant left
a little while ago.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:18.757
Whoa.

00:14:18.758 --> 00:14:20.392
Is that a real 930?

00:14:20.393 --> 00:14:21.894
The Widowmaker, right?

00:14:21.895 --> 00:14:24.096
Uh, honestly, I have no idea.
I've never even driven it.

00:14:24.097 --> 00:14:26.632
- I can't drive stick.
- What? You got to learn.

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:29.735
I will.
But first, the garage.

00:14:29.736 --> 00:14:33.272
So, I need
all this stuff put in these
plastic containers here,

00:14:33.273 --> 00:14:36.909
and I'd love it if you could
breathe some new life
into these pool floaties.

00:14:36.910 --> 00:14:39.245
I miss this T. rex.
He's my boy.

00:14:39.246 --> 00:14:42.214
- I got to head back
to the cold plunge.
- What's that?

00:14:42.215 --> 00:14:45.317
It's like a really freezing
cold tub of water,

00:14:45.318 --> 00:14:47.086
and I sit in there
for three minutes,

00:14:47.087 --> 00:14:49.788
and then I run to my sauna
for 15 minutes,

00:14:49.789 --> 00:14:51.890
and then I go back
and forth four times.

00:14:51.891 --> 00:14:53.659
It's supposed to be very good
for your circulation.

00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:54.760
Does it work?

00:14:54.761 --> 00:14:56.128
Honestly, I have no idea.

00:14:56.129 --> 00:14:57.997
Uh, if you need me,
just knock on the sauna.

00:14:57.998 --> 00:14:59.631
All right.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.067
Okay, let's get cold.

00:15:04.304 --> 00:15:05.372
Fuck!

00:15:08.841 --> 00:15:09.841
Oh, thank God.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.283
Time to plunge.

00:15:21.955 --> 00:15:23.189
Oh, come on.

00:15:25.092 --> 00:15:26.258
Boom.

00:15:26.259 --> 00:15:29.295
Holy fuck!
Look how clean my garage is.

00:15:29.296 --> 00:15:31.130
- Five stars, man.
- Thanks.

00:15:31.131 --> 00:15:33.532
Sorry. I got a bit peckish
while you were in there.

00:15:33.533 --> 00:15:36.135
You want some burrata?
You a burrata boy?

00:15:36.136 --> 00:15:37.769
Uh, not really familiar.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:39.139
You're shitting me!

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:41.473
Dude, you got to try it.

00:15:41.474 --> 00:15:42.976
- It's the best.
- All right.

00:15:45.778 --> 00:15:47.213
- Goddamn!
- Yeah!

00:15:47.214 --> 00:15:49.448
- That is some creamy cheese.
- It's good shit, right?

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.450
Yeah. I guess
I am a burrata boy.

00:15:51.451 --> 00:15:54.320
Welcome to the club.

00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:56.788
All right, man,
thank you. Really.

00:15:56.789 --> 00:15:57.889
Yeah.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.960
Um, so are you looking
for an assistant?

00:16:02.395 --> 00:16:03.796
I am.

00:16:04.764 --> 00:16:06.499
Would you ever consider me?

00:16:07.567 --> 00:16:09.168
I mean, we just met,
and, you know,

00:16:09.169 --> 00:16:11.338
I got a lot going on
in my life.

00:16:12.372 --> 00:16:14.006
Yeah, like what?

00:16:14.007 --> 00:16:15.974
My current to-do list?

00:16:15.975 --> 00:16:18.410
Uh, fix my pool heater,
get new house slippers,

00:16:18.411 --> 00:16:20.346
get a disco floor
for my party,

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:22.681
and find a shaman to take me
on an ayahuasca journey.

00:16:22.682 --> 00:16:26.019
It really runs the gamut,
but I can do it.

00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:28.755
You know what?

00:16:30.257 --> 00:16:32.158
I really like your vibe.

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:37.263
And I am very digging
this initiative that
you're showing right now.

00:16:37.264 --> 00:16:39.198
Why don't we do
a one-week trial,
see how it goes?

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:40.399
- I'm in.
- Nice!

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:42.202
Burrata boys for life!

00:16:43.303 --> 00:16:44.336
Well, for one week.

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.172
If that goes well,
then for life.

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:48.440
Yo!

00:16:48.441 --> 00:16:49.908
Hey.

00:16:49.909 --> 00:16:52.944
Ayahuasca, I can get you in
with a shaman named Tammy.

00:16:52.945 --> 00:16:54.380
I know it doesn't sound
too shaman-y,

00:16:54.381 --> 00:16:56.848
but apparently,
she's George Clooney's shaman.

00:16:56.849 --> 00:17:00.120
Ooh, he seems very zen.
Yeah, book Tammy.

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:02.554
All right.

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:04.756
Jeff is in.

00:17:04.757 --> 00:17:06.125
Uh-huh.

00:17:06.126 --> 00:17:08.394
No, the non-alcoholic
beverage space is exploding.

00:17:08.395 --> 00:17:10.596
Yeah, uh,
that sounds good. Yeah.

00:17:10.597 --> 00:17:12.431
Just send me the deck.
I'll check it out tomorrow.

00:17:12.432 --> 00:17:14.033
Thank you.

00:17:14.934 --> 00:17:17.203
Did you salt
the rim on this?

00:17:17.204 --> 00:17:18.604
What are you, a magician?

00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:19.871
Uh, disco floor,

00:17:19.872 --> 00:17:22.408
I found these
super chill Armenian brothers.

00:17:22.409 --> 00:17:24.810
They can do it. They just need
to know how big a space it is.

00:17:24.811 --> 00:17:26.412
Uh, it's that
whole room in there.

00:17:26.413 --> 00:17:28.747
Oh, whoa. You're having
a disco floor in your house?

00:17:28.748 --> 00:17:30.716
Yeah, it's, uh...
My 40th is coming up,

00:17:30.717 --> 00:17:32.251
so I'm gonna blow it out
a little bit.

00:17:32.252 --> 00:17:34.620
I've been working with this
dance choreographer, Shabier.

00:17:34.621 --> 00:17:35.721
He's teaching me
a whole routine

00:17:35.722 --> 00:17:37.723
- and everything.
- Nice.

00:17:37.724 --> 00:17:39.158
Right, so you go
arm then back.

00:17:39.159 --> 00:17:40.592
- Yeah.
- And then one.

00:17:40.593 --> 00:17:42.161
Yo, Arj, Arj,
will you film this

00:17:42.162 --> 00:17:43.562
in case I want
to watch it back later?

00:17:43.563 --> 00:17:44.996
- Yep. I got you.
- Awesome.

00:17:44.997 --> 00:17:46.498
- Okay. From arms.
- Ready?

00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:49.401
Yeah, from arms, you go,
you, everybody, in,

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:52.504
- love!
- Yeah! That was awesome!

00:17:52.505 --> 00:17:53.639
- You got that?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.442
My friends are
gonna freak out.

00:17:56.443 --> 00:17:58.677
I know you've been looking
for something special
for your 40th.

00:17:58.678 --> 00:17:59.978
I think
I found the watch.

00:17:59.979 --> 00:18:01.513
Check out
this case-back engraving.

00:18:01.514 --> 00:18:03.782
Oh, "Pretty Baby."
I love that.

00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:06.485
- How much is Pretty Baby?
- $250K.

00:18:06.486 --> 00:18:07.819
Let's do it.

00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.022
Jeff, pool guy can come
fix the heater next week.

00:18:10.723 --> 00:18:12.658
Perfect.

00:18:12.659 --> 00:18:15.261
So, besides that, you just
have that Zoom in ten minutes.

00:18:15.262 --> 00:18:17.429
Oh, great.
Um, two things for you.

00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:18.697
You got a parking ticket.

00:18:18.698 --> 00:18:20.866
- I put it downstairs
in the kitchen.
- Ugh.

00:18:20.867 --> 00:18:23.269
And I got you
a company credit card

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:25.204
for, you know,
expenses and stuff.

00:18:25.205 --> 00:18:27.673
Whoa. "Sauna Boss LLC."

00:18:27.674 --> 00:18:29.208
The one and only.

00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:30.476
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah.

00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:32.043
What the fuck do you do?

00:18:32.044 --> 00:18:34.980
Oh. Um, I run a VC firm.

00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:36.682
Uh, we invest
in smaller companies,

00:18:36.683 --> 00:18:38.384
I serve on the board
and consult for them.

00:18:38.385 --> 00:18:39.951
Foodzr,
that food delivery app,

00:18:39.952 --> 00:18:41.220
- that's one of ours.
- Ah.

00:18:41.221 --> 00:18:43.021
Uh, those, like, kiosks
you see at the airport

00:18:43.022 --> 00:18:44.623
that sell headphones,
those are ours.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:45.991
We make a shit ton
off of those.

00:18:45.992 --> 00:18:47.726
Nice. And how did
you get into that?

00:18:47.727 --> 00:18:49.728
Me and my friends,
we started this thing
with cell phone towers,

00:18:49.729 --> 00:18:51.163
that did well.

00:18:51.164 --> 00:18:52.531
We took that money,
we put it into this tech thing,

00:18:52.532 --> 00:18:53.699
that did really well.

00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:57.404
- And now, here we are.
- Here we are.

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.065
Hey, how's it going?

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.900
I was about to head over
to pick you up. All good?

00:19:28.901 --> 00:19:30.202
Hey.

00:19:30.203 --> 00:19:32.070
Look, I'm not one to flake,
but I was...

00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:33.705
I was driving
my cousin's car,

00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:35.207
and I was trying
to send somebody a video

00:19:35.208 --> 00:19:36.875
of this dog doing backflips,

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:39.177
and I backed
into a telephone pole.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.913
I'm totally fine, but I should
probably deal with this.

00:19:41.914 --> 00:19:43.382
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

00:19:43.383 --> 00:19:46.585
That sounds really annoying
and kinda cute.

00:19:46.586 --> 00:19:48.554
Be careful
texting and driving.

00:19:48.555 --> 00:19:50.756
I will. Is there any way
we could do another day?

00:19:50.757 --> 00:19:53.725
- Like, tomorrow even?
- Of course.

00:19:53.726 --> 00:19:56.595
Okay. See you
tomorrow then. Bye.

00:19:56.596 --> 00:19:57.664
Bye.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:03.569
Your session is complete.

00:20:03.570 --> 00:20:06.204
See if you can bring
some of this mindfulness

00:20:06.205 --> 00:20:07.874
into the rest of your day.

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.078
Meditation over!

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:15.247
Did you finish unpacking
all those clothes I got?

00:20:15.248 --> 00:20:17.082
Yeah, almost.
Love this guy.

00:20:17.083 --> 00:20:18.484
Yeah, that's fresh, huh?

00:20:18.485 --> 00:20:20.419
- Yeah.
- So...

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.220
let me show you something
real quick, okay?

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:23.622
Sure.

00:20:23.623 --> 00:20:25.090
So...

00:20:25.091 --> 00:20:27.759
God forbid,
any shit goes down,

00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:30.530
just want you to know
I have a gun.

00:20:31.898 --> 00:20:33.299
It's in this drawer
right here.

00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.902
Here's the safe.
The code is 1244.

00:20:36.903 --> 00:20:38.304
Whoa.

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:39.671
I'm not a big gun guy.

00:20:39.672 --> 00:20:41.139
I'll probably just hide,
if that's okay.

00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.474
Hey, I'm not
a big gun guy, either,

00:20:42.475 --> 00:20:43.942
but there was, like,
a bunch of home invasions

00:20:43.943 --> 00:20:45.844
in the neighborhood
and I got spooked.

00:20:45.845 --> 00:20:47.579
So, Maurice,
he's my gun trainer,

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.481
he says if someone's
in your home,

00:20:49.482 --> 00:20:52.250
the most important thing is
do not hesitate.

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:54.320
You shoot first,
and you ask questions later.

00:20:54.321 --> 00:20:56.956
They could be on meth
or something, you don't know.

00:20:57.924 --> 00:20:59.658
Troubling times, my friend.

00:20:59.659 --> 00:21:02.328
Oh, also, I need you
to call Dunsmoor

00:21:02.329 --> 00:21:04.630
and make me
a dinner reservation
for Friday night.

00:21:04.631 --> 00:21:06.432
Just tell Mattias
I'm coming in.

00:21:06.433 --> 00:21:09.468
He'll give me a nice table
at the bar.

00:21:09.469 --> 00:21:10.669
Um, sure.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:11.937
Oh, by the way,

00:21:11.938 --> 00:21:13.639
I was gonna ask,
I actually got a date tonight,

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.441
is it all right
if I head out after this?

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:17.709
Yeah. You got a hot date?

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:18.977
What's the plan?

00:21:18.978 --> 00:21:21.813
Uh, something low-key.
Probably go get tacos.

00:21:21.814 --> 00:21:25.984
Tacos? What?
Do you not like this girl?

00:21:25.985 --> 00:21:28.720
Yeah, I like this girl.
Do you not like tacos?

00:21:28.721 --> 00:21:30.322
How did you guys
meet each other?

00:21:30.323 --> 00:21:32.157
Mmm, we kinda met
at a taco place.

00:21:32.158 --> 00:21:34.225
And you're going
for more tacos?

00:21:34.226 --> 00:21:36.027
That's too many tacos, man.

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:38.229
That's
an all-taco relationship.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:40.799
- It's a lot.
- Yeah. Yo, go to Dunsmoor.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:42.233
That's nice.
She'll like that.

00:21:42.234 --> 00:21:45.203
- It's not too pricey, is it?
- No, no, no, not at all.

00:21:45.204 --> 00:21:47.373
And make sure you get
the ribeye, it's great.

00:21:47.374 --> 00:21:50.208
So let's talk
about the ensemble.

00:21:50.209 --> 00:21:52.411
Is this what we're, uh,
wearing on our date?

00:21:52.412 --> 00:21:53.946
The coffee stain
and all that?

00:21:54.781 --> 00:21:55.948
I guess.

00:21:57.049 --> 00:21:58.650
My little jacket.

00:21:58.651 --> 00:22:00.085
I got this little jacket.

00:22:00.086 --> 00:22:02.020
I bought it a while ago,
and I haven't returned it.

00:22:02.021 --> 00:22:03.755
It's a little teensy on me,

00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:05.391
but it could be
perfect on you.

00:22:05.392 --> 00:22:07.025
Yeah, you can borrow it
for the date.

00:22:07.026 --> 00:22:08.093
All right.

00:22:08.094 --> 00:22:09.928
- Yeah.
- Ooh, it's nice!

00:22:09.929 --> 00:22:11.129
Like a glove.

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.131
I feel like Kevin James
in Hitch.

00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:15.667
That makes me Hitch in Hitch.

00:22:15.668 --> 00:22:17.769
Hah. He's a cool guy.
Thank you.

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:20.238
- I like your jacket.
- Oh, thanks.

00:22:20.239 --> 00:22:22.073
- You look very nice, too.
- Thanks.

00:22:22.074 --> 00:22:23.742
Um, I'm so glad
we did this.

00:22:23.743 --> 00:22:26.378
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

00:22:26.379 --> 00:22:27.846
At first,
I kinda hated you.

00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:29.347
- What? What did I do?
- Yeah.

00:22:29.348 --> 00:22:30.549
I mean, you were
just so, like,

00:22:30.550 --> 00:22:31.950
"I don't believe in much."

00:22:31.951 --> 00:22:33.351
I... Oh, come on.

00:22:33.352 --> 00:22:34.953
- I didn't talk like that.
- Yeah. You did.

00:22:34.954 --> 00:22:36.221
"Oh, I don't know."

00:22:36.222 --> 00:22:38.724
- No. Come on.
- You did. Yeah, that was you.

00:22:38.725 --> 00:22:40.125
And now, look at you.

00:22:40.126 --> 00:22:41.259
Hey, guys,
how are we tonight?

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.228
- Hey, how are you?
- Good, thank you.

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:44.896
Thank you. So what are we
thinking food-wise?

00:22:44.897 --> 00:22:46.898
My friend said
we definitely have
to get a ribeye.

00:22:46.899 --> 00:22:48.366
It does
look very good.

00:22:48.367 --> 00:22:49.635
Oh, it's a signature dish.

00:22:49.636 --> 00:22:50.802
They grill it right
on the fire. It's so good.

00:22:50.803 --> 00:22:52.270
- All right.
- Cool.

00:22:52.271 --> 00:22:54.239
- Cool.
- Thanks.

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:57.142
- So we usually say about three
to four plates per person.
- All right.

00:22:57.143 --> 00:22:58.910
Everything is shared,
family style.

00:22:58.911 --> 00:23:00.712
And we have
some amazing wines,

00:23:00.713 --> 00:23:02.448
if you want to talk
to our sommelier about it.

00:23:02.449 --> 00:23:03.715
- Okay.
- Cool.

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:05.083
- I'll give you guys a minute.
- Thanks.

00:23:05.084 --> 00:23:06.585
Welcome.

00:23:06.586 --> 00:23:09.220
I am so good
without the ribeye.

00:23:09.221 --> 00:23:11.657
Yeah, it's a big steak.

00:23:11.658 --> 00:23:12.758
Maybe we do the trout.

00:23:12.759 --> 00:23:14.726
- Trout sounds perfect.
- Yeah.

00:23:14.727 --> 00:23:17.128
I'm actually super easy,
and they said everything's
meant to be shared.

00:23:17.129 --> 00:23:18.564
- So let's share.
- Yeah. Let's share,

00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:20.065
- family style.
- Yeah.

00:23:20.066 --> 00:23:21.332
It's a small family,
just the two of us.

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.101
No kids.

00:23:23.102 --> 00:23:25.437
I'm telling you,
I used to kill it in
my school talent shows.

00:23:25.438 --> 00:23:26.938
Really?
What was your talent?

00:23:26.939 --> 00:23:29.274
Singing, dancing, everything.

00:23:29.275 --> 00:23:31.643
- Oh. What'd you sing?
- Mmm.

00:23:31.644 --> 00:23:33.311
Hey, team. Here's the bill
whenever you're ready.

00:23:33.312 --> 00:23:35.081
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:23:37.183 --> 00:23:38.450
Wow. We should
definitely split this.

00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:40.486
No, no, no. I'll get it.

00:23:40.487 --> 00:23:42.754
- You sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:23:42.755 --> 00:23:45.256
Don't worry about it.
My treat.

00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:47.693
Thank you.
This was...

00:23:47.694 --> 00:23:48.795
This was so lovely.

00:24:13.419 --> 00:24:14.587
Hey, Arj?

00:24:15.555 --> 00:24:17.288
Hey. You get my email?

00:24:17.289 --> 00:24:19.691
Are you all set
for ayahuasca tonight?

00:24:19.692 --> 00:24:21.227
Yeah. Um...

00:24:23.229 --> 00:24:27.132
Did you use my card
to buy yourself dinner
last night?

00:24:27.133 --> 00:24:29.000
I... I talked to your
accountant about that.

00:24:29.001 --> 00:24:30.569
I... I'm gonna pay you back
right away.

00:24:30.570 --> 00:24:32.971
I just got in a little bit
of a jam at Dunsmoor,

00:24:32.972 --> 00:24:34.740
and the waitress recommended
an expensive bottle of wine.

00:24:34.741 --> 00:24:35.907
I didn't know what to do.

00:24:35.908 --> 00:24:38.209
- You can't do that.
- I totally get that.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:39.711
It won't happen again.

00:24:39.712 --> 00:24:41.379
And I'm gonna pay you back
as soon as I can.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.181
I'm really sorry.

00:24:43.182 --> 00:24:46.085
Um, we need to stop
working together, unfortunately.

00:24:48.220 --> 00:24:50.722
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:24:50.723 --> 00:24:52.057
I mean, I'm gonna
pay you back, man.

00:24:52.058 --> 00:24:54.526
You told me to go there.
You said it wasn't pricey.

00:24:54.527 --> 00:24:56.427
Just don't
make it weird, okay?

00:24:56.428 --> 00:24:59.031
Just, thank you for everything,
and I'm really sorry.

00:25:00.967 --> 00:25:02.301
Um, I'm sorry, too.

00:25:15.014 --> 00:25:17.048
"Currently full"?

00:25:25.157 --> 00:25:26.725
- Have you
done this before?
- No.

00:25:26.726 --> 00:25:29.895
Whole process takes
about an hour and a half
to two hours.

00:25:29.896 --> 00:25:31.096
Tonight,
we're gonna be working

00:25:31.097 --> 00:25:34.966
with magic mushrooms
and ayahuasca.

00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:36.636
All right, the needle's
gonna go right here.

00:26:10.803 --> 00:26:11.937
Yo.

00:26:11.938 --> 00:26:13.605
Get your lil' ass up.

00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:16.007
You can't be sleeping
in no Denny's, man.

00:26:16.008 --> 00:26:17.408
- I'm sorry.
- And them outlets are off.

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.345
You ain't getting no juice
to your phone.

00:26:27.887 --> 00:26:29.520
Hey!

00:26:29.521 --> 00:26:31.690
Did you see a Golf
parked out here?

00:26:31.691 --> 00:26:33.625
The one with the duct tape
on the bumper?

00:26:33.626 --> 00:26:35.627
- Yeah.
- It got towed.

00:26:35.628 --> 00:26:37.629
Towed? Why'd it get towed?

00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:39.130
I don't know.

00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:41.833
Am I dressed like a cop
or a guy that works at Denny's?

00:26:41.834 --> 00:26:42.902
Denny's.

00:26:45.638 --> 00:26:46.939
Parking tickets.

00:26:48.074 --> 00:26:49.875
Yeah, that'll do it.

00:26:49.876 --> 00:26:51.710
They gonna charge you for
the tickets and for the tow.

00:26:51.711 --> 00:26:53.178
I'm sorry.

00:26:53.179 --> 00:26:54.512
If I knew your night
was going like this,

00:26:54.513 --> 00:26:56.148
I'd have let you sleep
some more, man.

00:27:16.903 --> 00:27:18.805
His head's in his hands.

00:27:20.239 --> 00:27:21.407
I knew it.

00:27:22.975 --> 00:27:25.511
A lost soul.

00:27:27.914 --> 00:27:30.882
Arj, I'm an angel.
My name is Gabriel.

00:27:30.883 --> 00:27:32.184
I'm here to save you.

00:27:33.585 --> 00:27:34.753
What?

00:27:34.754 --> 00:27:36.856
Who the fuck are you?
How do you know my name?

00:27:38.891 --> 00:27:40.391
Maybe you don't understand.

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:42.728
I'm an angel.

00:27:42.729 --> 00:27:45.030
See the wings?

00:27:45.031 --> 00:27:47.432
I've been observing you.
I know all about you.

00:27:47.433 --> 00:27:49.500
I know you're living
in your car.

00:27:49.501 --> 00:27:51.837
I know you lost
your job with Jeff.

00:27:51.838 --> 00:27:54.172
- What?
- I even know that right now

00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:55.240
there's a part
of you that thinks

00:27:55.241 --> 00:27:56.908
your life
isn't worth living.

00:27:56.909 --> 00:27:58.910
But it's not true.

00:27:58.911 --> 00:28:01.546
You have so much
to live for.

00:28:01.547 --> 00:28:03.149
Let me show you.

00:28:06.118 --> 00:28:08.586
Holy shit!
What happened?

00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:10.055
What is this?
Where are we?

00:28:10.056 --> 00:28:14.259
Visions that reflect the hope
your life promises.

00:28:14.260 --> 00:28:18.530
I know you've been having
trouble finding work now,
but look.

00:28:21.467 --> 00:28:24.069
I get a job driving one
of those delivery trucks?

00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:25.871
- Yes.
- Hey, Arj.

00:28:25.872 --> 00:28:27.473
Don't forget
your pee bottle, bro.

00:28:28.808 --> 00:28:30.541
Why do I need
a pee bottle?

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:32.110
Your deadlines
are very strict

00:28:32.111 --> 00:28:34.379
and you don't have time
for bathroom breaks.

00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.348
Hence the pee bottle.

00:28:37.984 --> 00:28:38.984
Okay.

00:28:38.985 --> 00:28:41.253
But wait, there's more.

00:28:44.723 --> 00:28:48.493
I know you're living
in your car now, but look.

00:28:48.494 --> 00:28:50.595
Elena and I
move in together?

00:28:50.596 --> 00:28:53.131
Um, technically, you both
move in with her mom.

00:28:53.132 --> 00:28:55.767
Elena, Darryl and Mercedes
are coming over again.

00:28:55.768 --> 00:28:57.769
So could you two sleep
in the living room?

00:28:57.770 --> 00:28:59.304
And fold the couch bed up
in the morning, please.

00:28:59.305 --> 00:29:00.671
Yes, yes, Ma.

00:29:00.672 --> 00:29:03.074
Hey, has anyone seen
my air fryer? I can't find it.

00:29:03.075 --> 00:29:05.944
For the millionth time, Jay,
I didn't use your air fryer.

00:29:05.945 --> 00:29:07.745
I'm just eating spaghetti,
minding my business.

00:29:07.746 --> 00:29:09.180
Fuck it.

00:29:09.181 --> 00:29:10.816
Who's that guy?

00:29:10.817 --> 00:29:13.985
It's her sister
Patrice's on-and-off-again
boyfriend, Jay.

00:29:13.986 --> 00:29:16.121
- They live here, too.
- Arj,

00:29:16.122 --> 00:29:17.455
have you been
using my body wash?

00:29:17.456 --> 00:29:18.824
I'm missing some body wash.

00:29:18.825 --> 00:29:20.826
Seems a bit crowded.

00:29:20.827 --> 00:29:25.898
But you both
eventually get steady jobs
and move to Texas.

00:29:30.369 --> 00:29:31.837
Hey.

00:29:31.838 --> 00:29:33.839
So what'd they say?

00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:35.974
He's gonna have
to have the surgery.

00:29:35.975 --> 00:29:37.608
Okay, how much is it?

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:39.544
We can't afford it.

00:29:39.545 --> 00:29:41.446
Then what's gonna
happen to Dapper?

00:29:41.447 --> 00:29:42.881
Does that mean
we're gonna have to...

00:29:42.882 --> 00:29:44.149
Oh.

00:29:44.150 --> 00:29:46.151
Oh, no.

00:29:46.152 --> 00:29:48.686
I'm so sorry, buddy.

00:29:48.687 --> 00:29:51.456
We have to put
the dog to sleep?

00:29:51.457 --> 00:29:53.224
Yes.

00:29:53.225 --> 00:29:54.660
Let's maybe
get out of here.

00:29:56.362 --> 00:29:58.563
That's what I have
to live for?

00:29:58.564 --> 00:30:01.799
Yeah. What's wrong?
Why are you so upset?

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.368
Because my life sucks!

00:30:03.369 --> 00:30:07.138
I mean, it's not the
worst life in the world,
but damn, man.

00:30:07.139 --> 00:30:09.374
Pee bottle? Dead dog?

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:10.741
I did everything
I was supposed to do,

00:30:10.742 --> 00:30:12.178
and nothing's working out.

00:30:13.946 --> 00:30:16.547
I'm going to be honest
with you, Arj.

00:30:16.548 --> 00:30:19.150
I'm not really supposed
to be doing this.

00:30:19.151 --> 00:30:20.218
What does that mean?

00:30:20.219 --> 00:30:23.688
I'm overstepping
my bounds as an angel.

00:30:23.689 --> 00:30:26.191
Do you see how my wings
are kind of small?

00:30:26.192 --> 00:30:27.525
I wasn't gonna
say anything,

00:30:27.526 --> 00:30:29.527
but yeah,
they're on the tinier side.

00:30:29.528 --> 00:30:32.097
It means I'm lower order.

00:30:32.098 --> 00:30:33.364
I'm normally only in charge

00:30:33.365 --> 00:30:35.867
of saving people
from texting and driving.

00:30:35.868 --> 00:30:39.537
Wait. You're telling me I have
a budget guardian angel?

00:30:39.538 --> 00:30:42.207
Kinda.

00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:43.942
I'm just trying
to help you.

00:30:43.943 --> 00:30:45.743
I want you to have hope.

00:30:45.744 --> 00:30:49.347
I need to show you
that your life is precious,

00:30:49.348 --> 00:30:51.516
that it's worth living.

00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:53.118
My life isn't precious.

00:30:53.119 --> 00:30:56.087
My life is just in the service
of people like Jeff,

00:30:56.088 --> 00:30:57.588
the people
who actually get to live

00:30:57.589 --> 00:31:00.858
and go on vacations
and do cold plunges.

00:31:00.859 --> 00:31:04.663
You think Jeff's life is
the life that's worth living?

00:31:06.032 --> 00:31:09.100
Maybe I can show you
that that life

00:31:09.101 --> 00:31:11.570
is not all
it's cracked up to be.

00:31:17.944 --> 00:31:19.078
Sir?

00:31:22.448 --> 00:31:24.449
Sir, are you okay?

00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:26.451
What?

00:31:26.452 --> 00:31:28.419
You must've fallen asleep
in your car.

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:31.957
Yeah, I fell asleep.

00:31:31.958 --> 00:31:34.459
No problem.
Get home safe, okay?

00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:35.928
Okay.

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.068
Good morning, Arj.

00:31:43.069 --> 00:31:46.071
Would you like to go home?

00:31:46.072 --> 00:31:47.472
Navigating to home.

00:31:47.473 --> 00:31:51.177
Estimated drive time,
one hour and ten minutes.

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.116
Jeff?

00:32:31.283 --> 00:32:33.051
Yo!

00:32:33.052 --> 00:32:35.853
I was just upstairs unloading
some packages that came in.

00:32:35.854 --> 00:32:37.622
Those house slippers
you wanted arrived.

00:32:37.623 --> 00:32:39.125
They're very cool.

00:32:40.192 --> 00:32:42.827
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

00:32:42.828 --> 00:32:45.196
You good?
You need anything?

00:32:45.197 --> 00:32:48.666
- No, I'm good.
- All right.

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:51.369
Uh, I'm gonna
go finish up.

00:32:51.370 --> 00:32:54.473
Just let me know
if you want anything, okay?

00:32:56.442 --> 00:32:58.077
- Uh, hey, Jeff.
- Yeah?

00:33:00.212 --> 00:33:01.747
Whose house is this?

00:33:03.215 --> 00:33:05.417
Your house.

00:33:25.804 --> 00:33:27.605
Enjoying your new life?

00:33:27.606 --> 00:33:28.939
What's happened?

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.709
You wanted to have wealth
and success, here you go.

00:33:31.710 --> 00:33:33.044
Take a good look around,

00:33:33.045 --> 00:33:35.746
see if Jeff's life is
all it's cracked up to be.

00:33:35.747 --> 00:33:36.947
I'll check in on you,

00:33:36.948 --> 00:33:38.383
and at the end of the week,
we'll assess.

00:33:38.384 --> 00:33:40.351
- But I'm still me?
- Yes.

00:33:40.352 --> 00:33:43.020
Your name is Arj,
you look like you,

00:33:43.021 --> 00:33:46.257
but everything else
is Jeff's life.

00:33:46.258 --> 00:33:49.427
Both the good
and the bad.

00:33:49.428 --> 00:33:50.895
What happened to Jeff?

00:33:50.896 --> 00:33:53.631
He has your life.
He thinks he's you.

00:33:53.632 --> 00:33:55.233
So he's my assistant?

00:33:55.234 --> 00:33:56.701
Yes.

00:33:56.702 --> 00:33:57.969
So he has to do
whatever I ask him to do?

00:33:58.670 --> 00:33:59.704
Yes.

00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:01.072
If I'm hungry
and I want a snack?

00:34:01.073 --> 00:34:03.141
He'll get it for you.

00:34:03.142 --> 00:34:04.375
Hey, Jeff!

00:34:04.376 --> 00:34:06.877
Chips and guac
coming right up.

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:08.613
My man!

00:34:08.614 --> 00:34:09.980
I'm just gonna
head upstairs to your room,

00:34:09.981 --> 00:34:11.249
and finish unpacking
those clothes.

00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:12.617
All right, cool.

00:34:12.618 --> 00:34:14.819
Enjoying the pool?

00:34:14.820 --> 00:34:17.322
Gabriel, the angel!
Can Jeff see you?

00:34:17.323 --> 00:34:18.989
No, only you can see me.

00:34:18.990 --> 00:34:22.260
Ah. Well, I got to say,
so far, this is great.

00:34:22.261 --> 00:34:23.994
You want to hit the pool?
Pop on some trunks?

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:25.996
Hey, Arj, uh,
just reminding you,

00:34:25.997 --> 00:34:27.398
you got this meeting
coming up.

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:29.134
You should probably
get ready to go soon.

00:34:29.135 --> 00:34:30.835
Meeting?

00:34:30.836 --> 00:34:31.969
I don't know
anything about his work.

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:33.138
What am I gonna say?

00:34:33.139 --> 00:34:35.973
You wanted to see
what this life is like.

00:34:35.974 --> 00:34:39.277
Time to get to work,
Mr. Mogul.

00:34:39.278 --> 00:34:40.678
- That's for you.
- Oh, God.

00:34:40.679 --> 00:34:42.548
There we go,
bon appe-fucking-tit.

00:34:46.252 --> 00:34:47.485
Oh, my God!

00:34:47.486 --> 00:34:50.020
- This sushi's insane!
- So sick, right?

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:52.657
They fly the fish in
from Japan every morning.

00:34:52.658 --> 00:34:54.292
Very high carbon footprint.

00:34:54.293 --> 00:34:55.693
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

00:34:55.694 --> 00:34:57.027
Yo, did you check out
that launch proposal

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:58.196
I sent over
for the event next week?

00:34:58.197 --> 00:34:59.365
What'd you think
about that?

00:34:59.831 --> 00:35:00.831
Uh...

00:35:00.832 --> 00:35:02.267
"Uh..."

00:35:02.268 --> 00:35:04.034
Looked good, I guess.

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:06.804
Yeah? Great.

00:35:06.805 --> 00:35:08.439
All right. Well, yeah,
that's all the business

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.508
we had to get to today.
So, what the fuck? How's life?

00:35:10.509 --> 00:35:13.811
Uh, same old. Just working,
cold plunging. You?

00:35:13.812 --> 00:35:15.213
Work has been crazy, man.

00:35:15.214 --> 00:35:17.148
I had to fire one
of my assistants, Darren.

00:35:17.149 --> 00:35:18.483
- Oh.
- Yeah, he's a sweetheart.

00:35:18.484 --> 00:35:20.885
But I had this big event
in New York last week

00:35:20.886 --> 00:35:22.453
and I put him
in charge of vibes.

00:35:22.454 --> 00:35:24.322
And then I get there,
and the vibes are
just super off.

00:35:24.323 --> 00:35:25.390
- Hate that.
- Yeah.

00:35:25.391 --> 00:35:27.124
- Wrong kind of candles.
- Oh.

00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:29.327
He didn't tag
the liquor sponsor
in the media posts.

00:35:29.328 --> 00:35:31.196
- No!
- The event was off a cliff.

00:35:31.197 --> 00:35:33.063
- The vibes were just tanked.
- What was the scent

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.732
he was supposed to get
and what did he grab instead?

00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:35.866
He was supposed
to get sandalwood.

00:35:35.867 --> 00:35:37.001
- He got vetiver.
- Ugh!

00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:38.569
Whole place
smelled like shit.

00:35:38.570 --> 00:35:40.070
Those aren't the same smells.

00:35:40.071 --> 00:35:41.472
- Everybody at the event
must've been furious.
- Yeah.

00:35:41.473 --> 00:35:43.040
But you know
what though, dude?

00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:46.211
I've been reading a lot about,
like, empathy and forgiveness

00:35:46.212 --> 00:35:48.379
in this new Jay Shetty book,
so blessings to Darren.

00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.315
Ah, thank you.
Hey, let me get this.

00:35:50.316 --> 00:35:52.750
Dude, no. Put it
on the company.

00:35:52.751 --> 00:35:54.852
It was a "business lunch"
after all, right?

00:35:54.853 --> 00:35:57.188
Oh, yeah.
Why would we pay?

00:35:57.189 --> 00:36:00.191
This was the best lunch
I've ever had!

00:36:00.192 --> 00:36:02.193
Thank you. All right,
we got to go, though.

00:36:02.194 --> 00:36:04.395
I got to hit the cardio store,
get a couple nibbles.

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:13.170
Excuse me, sir.

00:36:13.171 --> 00:36:14.739
Oh, hi.
Can I help you?

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.442
Yeah, I'm Grant. You called me
to check out the pool heater.

00:36:17.443 --> 00:36:19.277
Ooh, that's right.
What's the deal?

00:36:19.278 --> 00:36:20.945
So, bad news,
the heater's busted.

00:36:20.946 --> 00:36:22.213
Probably gonna have
to replace it.

00:36:22.214 --> 00:36:23.848
Probably like 30K
for the heater,

00:36:23.849 --> 00:36:26.016
another five
for the install.

00:36:26.017 --> 00:36:27.118
Okay.

00:36:28.487 --> 00:36:30.621
Problems with your home?

00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:35.025
Some pretty serious expenses.
Must be inconvenient.

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:36.561
Good thing I got
a shit ton of money

00:36:36.562 --> 00:36:39.297
to cover any and all problems
that come my way.

00:36:39.298 --> 00:36:40.598
See you later, Gabe.

00:36:40.599 --> 00:36:42.533

00:37:00.752 --> 00:37:02.720
You helped me find some lumber

How's it going

00:37:05.991 --> 00:37:07.058
In lumber?

00:37:08.159 --> 00:37:09.627
It's good.

00:37:09.628 --> 00:37:12.630

00:37:24.743 --> 00:37:26.511
Do we have any thoughts
food-wise?

00:37:26.512 --> 00:37:28.613
Uh, I mean, we were
looking at the ribeye.

00:37:28.614 --> 00:37:30.782
- It does look very good.
- Let's do it.

00:37:35.454 --> 00:37:36.821
This wine is drinking great.

00:37:36.822 --> 00:37:38.589
And this food
is eating great.

00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:41.426
Be careful. You gonna
give me gout tonight.

00:37:41.427 --> 00:37:43.661
It has been such a pleasure
serving you guys.

00:37:43.662 --> 00:37:45.496
Uh, dinner's on us tonight.

00:37:45.497 --> 00:37:46.597
- What?
- No.

00:37:46.598 --> 00:37:48.634
- What? What?
- Yes.

00:37:52.904 --> 00:37:53.939
Oh, no.

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:57.207
Fascinating couple
of days, I imagine.

00:37:57.208 --> 00:37:59.444
Hey, what's up?
You need something?

00:37:59.445 --> 00:38:01.546
I'm kinda busy
ordering clothes.

00:38:01.547 --> 00:38:03.514
So, what are you thinking?

00:38:03.515 --> 00:38:05.584
The week is over,
are you ready to go back?

00:38:06.418 --> 00:38:08.018
Go back?
What do you mean?

00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:11.822
Don't you see what's special
about your life as it was?

00:38:11.823 --> 00:38:16.595
You see how superficial
a life of wealth and success
ultimately is?

00:38:17.363 --> 00:38:18.663
No.

00:38:18.664 --> 00:38:23.233
But have you really reflected
on your experience?

00:38:23.234 --> 00:38:25.336
Are you nuts?
I was living in my car!

00:38:25.337 --> 00:38:27.171
Now I'm living
in this giant house.

00:38:27.172 --> 00:38:29.173
I can buy whatever I want,
do whatever I want.

00:38:29.174 --> 00:38:31.008
But what about your job?
What about Elena?

00:38:31.009 --> 00:38:32.176
What about the pool heater?

00:38:32.177 --> 00:38:34.545
Who gives a fuck
about the pool heater?

00:38:34.546 --> 00:38:37.648
I show you something
to make you realize
your life is precious.

00:38:37.649 --> 00:38:40.418
You see it and you go back.
You can't just stay.

00:38:40.419 --> 00:38:43.455
So it's all over?
You're gonna make me go back?

00:38:44.255 --> 00:38:45.424
No, I can't do that.

00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:48.258
So if I want to stay,
I can just stay?

00:38:48.259 --> 00:38:49.760
- Yes.
- I have to want to go back?

00:38:49.761 --> 00:38:51.195
- That's right.
- Then I don't want to go back.

00:38:51.196 --> 00:38:52.430
But you can't do that!

00:38:52.431 --> 00:38:55.099
- You just said I could.
- Shucks.

00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:56.767
You guided someone?

00:38:56.768 --> 00:39:01.439
Gabriel, you're not
supposed to talk to people
or be visible.

00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.274
- I know that.
- Then why did you do this?

00:39:04.275 --> 00:39:05.876
He was a lost soul.

00:39:05.877 --> 00:39:07.111
I tried to show him

00:39:07.112 --> 00:39:09.680
that wealth wouldn't
solve all his problems.

00:39:09.681 --> 00:39:10.948
And?

00:39:10.949 --> 00:39:14.519
It seems to have solved
most of his problems.

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:17.688
Gabriel, you were
supposed to help Elena.

00:39:17.689 --> 00:39:20.425
What you've done has
really changed things.

00:39:20.426 --> 00:39:22.427
She had to cancel
her date with Arj

00:39:22.428 --> 00:39:24.294
and that set off
a chain reaction.

00:39:24.295 --> 00:39:26.931
The date went differently,
Arj lost his job,

00:39:26.932 --> 00:39:28.399
and that's
what's led us here.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.901
You have to get Arj
to go back.

00:39:30.902 --> 00:39:34.572
And until you do,
I have to take your wings.

00:39:34.573 --> 00:39:36.474
Oh, man.

00:39:36.475 --> 00:39:38.477
Turn around.

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.754
♪ Ow! Baby! ♪

00:39:49.755 --> 00:39:51.256
My guy!

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:55.894
Hey! Who wants
some fresh bubble?

00:39:56.562 --> 00:39:58.629
Whoa!

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:01.666
Justin needs them bubs.

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:04.769
Elena needs some bubs.

00:40:04.770 --> 00:40:06.471
Tell me what you think.
Be honest.

00:40:06.472 --> 00:40:08.507
Don't lie to me,
don't lie to me.

00:40:09.407 --> 00:40:11.008
How's it drinking?

00:40:11.009 --> 00:40:12.944
- That's drinking nice.
- Yes.

00:40:14.379 --> 00:40:15.980
Jeff! Come here, man.

00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:18.082
Have some wine.
Have a little glass.

00:40:18.083 --> 00:40:20.586
- Oh, wow. Thanks.
- Here, have some. Have fun.

00:40:23.088 --> 00:40:25.422
- That's really good.
- Yeah.

00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:26.957
I should get back
to cleaning up, though.

00:40:26.958 --> 00:40:28.927
Good call.
Keep cleaning, Jeff.

00:40:29.661 --> 00:40:31.195
Hey!

00:40:31.196 --> 00:40:33.197
It's Gabriel!

00:40:33.198 --> 00:40:35.199
Gabriel, the angel.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.334
- Where's your little wings?
- I lost them.

00:40:37.335 --> 00:40:38.703
Ooh. You've been a bad boy.

00:40:38.704 --> 00:40:40.505
So no wings,
what does that mean?

00:40:40.506 --> 00:40:42.372
People can see me,
I have less powers.

00:40:42.373 --> 00:40:44.509
- It's very embarrassing.
- Uh-oh.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:47.478
Listen, I know
you like this life,

00:40:47.479 --> 00:40:49.480
but may I pose a question?

00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:51.181
Is this fair to Jeff?

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:53.350
Jeff? Jeff's chilling.

00:40:53.351 --> 00:40:54.553
Is he?

00:40:56.254 --> 00:40:57.255
What are you doing?

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:07.733
Why am I holding
my own trash?

00:41:08.934 --> 00:41:10.068
Why are you in my clothes?

00:41:11.803 --> 00:41:13.137
What's happening right now?

00:41:13.138 --> 00:41:14.673
What did you do to me?

00:41:19.545 --> 00:41:21.211
- Oh, no.
- What happened?

00:41:21.212 --> 00:41:22.479
I gave him his memory back,

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:24.048
but I think he may
have went into shock.

00:41:24.049 --> 00:41:25.182
Is he dead?

00:41:25.183 --> 00:41:27.151
No. Definitely not.

00:41:27.152 --> 00:41:29.720
Oh, shit,
some dude just died.

00:41:29.721 --> 00:41:30.988
Let's bounce.

00:41:30.989 --> 00:41:32.591
He's not dead!

00:41:33.625 --> 00:41:36.260
I hope not.

00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:40.031
I did not know you were
struggling to the point
that you needed

00:41:40.932 --> 00:41:43.067
divine intervention.

00:41:43.068 --> 00:41:44.735
But you got
to switch back, man!

00:41:44.736 --> 00:41:46.737
Give me my life back.

00:41:46.738 --> 00:41:48.906
So, what? I just go back
to living in my car?

00:41:48.907 --> 00:41:51.408
- You lived in your car?
- Yes, Jeff, I did.

00:41:51.409 --> 00:41:53.043
Why do you think
an angel got involved?

00:41:53.044 --> 00:41:54.411
'Cause I had
too many roommates?

00:41:54.412 --> 00:41:56.346
Okay, that's bad.

00:41:56.347 --> 00:41:58.015
And I acknowledge that.

00:41:58.016 --> 00:41:59.917
So here's
what I'm going to do.

00:41:59.918 --> 00:42:01.719
If you switch back
right now,

00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.855
I'm going
to give you $200,000.

00:42:04.856 --> 00:42:07.124
You spend more than
that on one of your watches!

00:42:07.125 --> 00:42:08.392
You're lowballing me
on your existence?

00:42:08.393 --> 00:42:09.459
You live in your car!

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:10.595
I thought that'd be
a lot to you.

00:42:10.596 --> 00:42:12.129
- I don't know.
- How greedy are you, man?

00:42:12.130 --> 00:42:13.764
I'm not greedy!
It's an opening offer!

00:42:13.765 --> 00:42:15.299
- That's how negotiations work.
- That's worth your entire life?

00:42:15.300 --> 00:42:16.934
Counter! Make me an offer.

00:42:16.935 --> 00:42:18.869
Time out, guys.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:21.038
You can't do that, Jeff.

00:42:21.039 --> 00:42:22.607
This is Arj's experience.

00:42:22.608 --> 00:42:25.275
- You might not
remember anything.
- What?

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.777
Okay, how's this?

00:42:26.778 --> 00:42:29.580
Switch back,
or you are evil,

00:42:29.581 --> 00:42:32.382
and this angel man will
send you to Hell forever.

00:42:32.383 --> 00:42:33.483
Smite him!

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:35.119
I can't send someone to Hell.

00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.486
That's actually
not my department.

00:42:36.487 --> 00:42:39.390
Good God, man,
you are very unhelpful!

00:42:41.226 --> 00:42:42.260
Listen.

00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:45.162
I drive around L.A.

00:42:45.163 --> 00:42:49.600
I see the homeless,
houseless crisis

00:42:49.601 --> 00:42:50.901
that has befallen us,

00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:52.970
and I did not know that
you were a part of that,

00:42:52.971 --> 00:42:54.271
and I don't want you to be.

00:42:54.272 --> 00:42:55.840
But that being said,

00:42:55.841 --> 00:42:58.508
I think stealing
my entire life

00:42:58.509 --> 00:42:59.945
is a little bit harsh.

00:43:01.412 --> 00:43:03.113
You're not
a bad person, Arj.

00:43:03.114 --> 00:43:06.384
I know you don't
want to hurt Jeff
to have a good life.

00:43:08.319 --> 00:43:10.520
- All right, I'll switch back.
- Yeah! Fuck yeah!

00:43:10.521 --> 00:43:12.790
- But I want a few days.
- For what?

00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:14.091
To do some fun shit, okay?

00:43:14.092 --> 00:43:16.461
Come on, a few days.

00:43:17.929 --> 00:43:18.930
Jeff?

00:43:21.733 --> 00:43:23.100
You know what?

00:43:23.101 --> 00:43:26.104
If that's what
you feel you need,
I will do that.

00:43:27.405 --> 00:43:28.673
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:43:28.674 --> 00:43:31.275
Okay.

00:43:31.276 --> 00:43:32.677
So in the meantime,
can I get a few grand

00:43:32.678 --> 00:43:34.679
so I can get, like,
a hotel room and shit?

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.714
Yeah, yeah,
let's get you a nice suite
at the Chateau Marmont.

00:43:36.715 --> 00:43:38.382
Or how about get fucked!

00:43:38.383 --> 00:43:41.151
You fired me
'cause I put, like, $300
on your credit card!

00:43:41.152 --> 00:43:43.254
Why don't you tough it out
for a few days?

00:43:44.522 --> 00:43:46.223
I see
what's happening here.

00:43:46.224 --> 00:43:47.958
Eat the rich, am I right?

00:43:47.959 --> 00:43:49.459
You think
'cause I'm a tech bro,

00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.561
I can't live your life
for a little while?

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:53.698
I can live your life
in my sleep.

00:43:53.699 --> 00:43:55.966
I came from nothing.
I'm self-made.

00:43:55.967 --> 00:43:57.301
You came from nothing?

00:43:57.302 --> 00:43:59.837
Oh, I came from very,
very humble beginnings.

00:43:59.838 --> 00:44:00.905
What'd your parents do?

00:44:00.906 --> 00:44:03.741
My father was
an orthopedic surgeon,

00:44:03.742 --> 00:44:06.476
and my mother
practiced law.

00:44:06.477 --> 00:44:08.212
- Hmm.
- At a pretty big firm.

00:44:08.213 --> 00:44:09.379
Hmm.

00:44:09.380 --> 00:44:11.015
But that is not
the money that I got

00:44:11.016 --> 00:44:12.482
for my cell phone
tower thing.

00:44:12.483 --> 00:44:13.985
That came from
my grandfather,

00:44:15.286 --> 00:44:16.654
who owned newspapers.

00:44:18.223 --> 00:44:19.690
You know what?

00:44:19.691 --> 00:44:23.060
Enjoy the fruits
of my hard work.

00:44:23.061 --> 00:44:25.996
I'll be out there
just fine!

00:44:25.997 --> 00:44:27.198
Okay.

00:44:30.101 --> 00:44:31.501
Well, what are
you going to do?

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.503
I'm going to give you
some space

00:44:33.504 --> 00:44:35.706
and see you
in a few days.

00:44:35.707 --> 00:44:36.775
Bye.

00:44:38.243 --> 00:44:40.010
Hey, Jeff?

00:44:40.011 --> 00:44:43.848
So, um, since I lost my wings,
I need a place to stay.

00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:45.282
Can I move in with you?

00:44:45.283 --> 00:44:48.352
I mean, I'm living in this
yucky little motel now.

00:44:48.353 --> 00:44:50.554
What, are we going
to share a bed?

00:44:50.555 --> 00:44:53.724
I'll go under the covers
and you go over.

00:44:53.725 --> 00:44:55.292
Or I'll go over
and you go under.

00:44:55.293 --> 00:44:57.996
Whichever you prefer.
What do you say?

00:44:59.130 --> 00:45:00.165
Roomies?

00:45:04.770 --> 00:45:06.037
I'll be right down.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.077
So, like,
could you fly?

00:45:13.378 --> 00:45:15.412
Uh, no.

00:45:15.413 --> 00:45:17.948
My wings were too small.

00:45:17.949 --> 00:45:20.617
Well, it's not
the size of the wing.

00:45:20.618 --> 00:45:23.588
- Actually, it is.
- Oh, that's too bad.

00:45:29.494 --> 00:45:30.495
Hello?

00:45:32.697 --> 00:45:34.431
Checkout time.

00:45:34.432 --> 00:45:37.467
Hello?

00:45:37.468 --> 00:45:38.536
One second.

00:45:41.406 --> 00:45:42.407
Hello?

00:45:48.914 --> 00:45:50.815
Uh, checkout time.

00:45:50.816 --> 00:45:54.118
I don't want to check out.
I would like to stay here.

00:45:54.119 --> 00:45:56.086
You want to stay,
you pay money.

00:45:56.087 --> 00:45:59.256
- How much money?
- $125.

00:45:59.257 --> 00:46:01.458
I don't have
that much money right now.

00:46:01.459 --> 00:46:03.493
If no have, you check out.

00:46:03.494 --> 00:46:06.564
How about I pay you
by tonight? Is that okay?

00:46:07.732 --> 00:46:08.967
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:13.939
We need to find a way
to make some money.

00:46:18.343 --> 00:46:19.810
Here you go.

00:46:19.811 --> 00:46:22.479
Hey, is there any update
on the huevos rancheros
for Alex?

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:24.281
Um, gonna be another 15.

00:46:24.282 --> 00:46:25.649
Fifteen minutes?

00:46:25.650 --> 00:46:27.517
- I don't know, man.
- I'm double parked over here!

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:28.785
You hear these honks?

00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:29.854
These honks are for me!

00:46:29.855 --> 00:46:31.188
Order for Alex.

00:46:31.189 --> 00:46:32.957
Thank you. What happened
to 15 minutes?

00:46:32.958 --> 00:46:34.024
What do
you want me to say?

00:46:34.025 --> 00:46:35.392
- I hate my life.
- Thank you.

00:46:35.393 --> 00:46:38.028
Come on! You can't
double park! Let's go!

00:46:38.029 --> 00:46:40.030
- One second.
- Get a pet-sitting job!

00:46:40.031 --> 00:46:41.731
- Sorry! Okay.
- Let's go, go, go!

00:46:41.732 --> 00:46:43.567
Oh, my God.

00:46:43.568 --> 00:46:45.136
Shit.

00:46:46.604 --> 00:46:47.972
Oh, shit!

00:46:47.973 --> 00:46:49.406
You hit a car.

00:46:49.407 --> 00:46:51.876
I know I hit a car,
I can see that!

00:46:51.877 --> 00:46:53.377
I'm used
to my normal car's cameras

00:46:53.378 --> 00:46:55.679
and sensors and shit,
it beeps.

00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:57.015
I need the beeps!

00:47:07.392 --> 00:47:08.993
"Pizza was yummy.
Five stars!"

00:47:08.994 --> 00:47:10.595
Nice!

00:47:11.562 --> 00:47:13.197
They tipped you $1.15.

00:47:13.198 --> 00:47:14.665
Dicks!

00:47:16.401 --> 00:47:17.834
Jeff, Renee's getting antsy
about her poke bowl.

00:47:17.835 --> 00:47:19.536
Yeah, tell her
it's on the way.

00:47:19.537 --> 00:47:22.506
Why does she need
this poke bowl so soon?

00:47:22.507 --> 00:47:25.442
Let's pick up some
pad Thai for Martin.

00:47:25.443 --> 00:47:26.944
Can I use
your restroom real quick?

00:47:26.945 --> 00:47:28.445
Drivers can't
use the bathroom.

00:47:28.446 --> 00:47:30.614
Great, thanks.

00:47:30.615 --> 00:47:33.350
Order up!
I'm ready for my food.

00:47:33.351 --> 00:47:35.220
Oh, you got to be
fucking kidding me.

00:47:36.454 --> 00:47:38.323
You're serving this thing
before me?

00:47:39.958 --> 00:47:41.591
This is how the robots win,
you know.

00:47:41.592 --> 00:47:43.760
Jeff, Ashley's wondering
where the rigatoni is.

00:47:43.761 --> 00:47:44.895
Yeah, well, tell Ashley

00:47:44.896 --> 00:47:46.263
they gave her rigatoni
to the last guy

00:47:46.264 --> 00:47:47.697
and then they gave me
chicken parm,

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:48.765
and now I got to go back

00:47:48.766 --> 00:47:49.900
to the place
to get her rigatoni

00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:51.736
while they make
a whole new rigatoni.

00:47:53.271 --> 00:47:54.704
Just tell her
it'll be there soon.

00:47:54.705 --> 00:47:55.805
Look out!

00:47:55.806 --> 00:47:57.674
I'm coming through.

00:47:57.675 --> 00:47:59.043
♪ But I don't know
what it is ♪

00:47:59.044 --> 00:48:03.447
♪ 'Cause everybody's
happy nowadays... ♪

00:48:03.448 --> 00:48:05.782
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where's the extra ranch, homie?

00:48:05.783 --> 00:48:08.485
Oh, uh, I don't,
like, pack the bags.

00:48:08.486 --> 00:48:09.619
I just deliver them, so...

00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:10.988
Okay, but I can't
eat this amount of wings

00:48:10.989 --> 00:48:12.923
with this amount of ranch.
You understand?

00:48:12.924 --> 00:48:15.425
I agree that's not
enough ranch,

00:48:15.426 --> 00:48:16.560
but I don't know
what to tell you.

00:48:16.561 --> 00:48:19.229
Okay, well, one ranch,
one star, bitch.

00:48:19.230 --> 00:48:20.830
Please don't do that!

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:21.899
Fuck!

00:48:23.234 --> 00:48:24.734
We made
enough money, right?

00:48:24.735 --> 00:48:26.003
Yeah, definitely.

00:48:26.004 --> 00:48:27.972
As long as this lady
lets us pay by phone,

00:48:27.973 --> 00:48:29.574
we're good.

00:48:32.243 --> 00:48:33.944
No.

00:48:33.945 --> 00:48:35.079
No, no, no, no, no!

00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:37.082
I don't get paid
till the end of the week?

00:48:38.383 --> 00:48:40.918
Don't these shitheads know
I need this money now?

00:48:43.354 --> 00:48:45.422
You know, with all
we spent on gas,

00:48:45.423 --> 00:48:47.225
we actually lost money today.

00:48:48.493 --> 00:48:50.061
Where are we going to sleep?

00:48:52.697 --> 00:48:56.333
Let's focus on the positives
about the car.

00:48:56.334 --> 00:48:57.434
It's tight on space,

00:48:57.435 --> 00:48:59.269
but since we've got
separate seats,

00:48:59.270 --> 00:49:01.706
it's like we each have
our own little beds.

00:49:03.608 --> 00:49:07.844
Maybe we could put
a little curtain up
in between for privacy.

00:49:07.845 --> 00:49:09.147
Could be cute.

00:49:10.248 --> 00:49:11.348
No.

00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:13.151
No curtain, okay.

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:16.621
But will you promise
to think about it?

00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:19.991
Yeah, okay,
I'll think about it.

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:26.963
You look stunning.

00:49:26.964 --> 00:49:28.065
You look ravishing.

00:49:28.066 --> 00:49:31.168
Listen, I have
a crazy question for you.

00:49:31.169 --> 00:49:33.470
Do you want to go
to Paris this weekend?

00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:34.838
What?

00:49:34.839 --> 00:49:36.540
Like "Paris" Paris?

00:49:36.541 --> 00:49:38.475
- This weekend?
- Yeah.

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:40.644
I actually have, uh...

00:49:40.645 --> 00:49:42.246
the union meeting.
I can't.

00:49:42.247 --> 00:49:44.514
But is there any way
we can go another time?

00:49:44.515 --> 00:49:47.884
Uh, it kinda has
to be this weekend.

00:49:47.885 --> 00:49:50.087
Why's it got to be
this weekend?

00:49:50.088 --> 00:49:53.357
I can't really explain,
but it just does.

00:49:53.358 --> 00:49:55.059
Could you blow off
the union thing?

00:49:55.060 --> 00:49:57.694
It took so long to get
everybody to believe
in this thing, I...

00:49:57.695 --> 00:49:59.696
I don't want them
to think I'm not serious.

00:50:01.899 --> 00:50:04.469
- What is that noise?
- It's...

00:50:05.336 --> 00:50:06.503
It's frustration

00:50:06.504 --> 00:50:08.072
'cause there's this
one version of our lives

00:50:08.073 --> 00:50:11.007
where we both go
to Paris this weekend,

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.676
we have
this amazing time together.

00:50:12.677 --> 00:50:14.278
And instead,
you got to stay here

00:50:14.279 --> 00:50:17.414
and fight for better
working conditions
at Hardware Heaven.

00:50:17.415 --> 00:50:18.616
And that sucks.

00:50:19.284 --> 00:50:21.118
Why does it suck?

00:50:21.119 --> 00:50:22.619
It's my life.

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.390
- I didn't mean it that way.
- No. I think you did.

00:50:27.292 --> 00:50:28.792
I get it.

00:50:28.793 --> 00:50:30.727
We live
two different lives.

00:50:30.728 --> 00:50:33.130
I live in my design studio
and sleep on a futon

00:50:33.131 --> 00:50:35.599
and you sleep here.

00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:39.203
But this is my life,
and I have to fight for it

00:50:39.204 --> 00:50:42.573
whether you think it's
worth fighting for or not.

00:50:43.508 --> 00:50:44.509
- Elena, I...
- No.

00:50:46.144 --> 00:50:47.145
Save it.

00:50:48.279 --> 00:50:49.347
I'm going to go home.

00:51:20.345 --> 00:51:22.312
Got some snacks!

00:51:22.313 --> 00:51:23.514
We have a problem.

00:51:24.315 --> 00:51:25.849
- What?
- It's Arj.

00:51:25.850 --> 00:51:27.851
I spoke with a colleague.

00:51:27.852 --> 00:51:29.187
He had an accident.

00:51:29.987 --> 00:51:31.455
He's in a coma.

00:51:31.456 --> 00:51:33.757
He's in a coma?

00:51:33.758 --> 00:51:35.692
What happened to him?

00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:37.628
He was texting and driving.

00:51:38.363 --> 00:51:39.463
What?

00:51:39.464 --> 00:51:41.097
I... I thought that was
your whole thing,

00:51:41.098 --> 00:51:42.832
to not let that happen!

00:51:42.833 --> 00:51:44.701
I'm here.
I couldn't save him.

00:51:44.702 --> 00:51:46.336
So what happens now?

00:51:46.337 --> 00:51:49.373
We have to wait
till he gets out of the coma.

00:51:49.374 --> 00:51:51.542
He has to be the one
who wants to switch.

00:51:53.278 --> 00:51:56.946
I agreed to switch lives
with him for a few days

00:51:56.947 --> 00:51:58.348
out of the kindness
of my heart

00:51:58.349 --> 00:51:59.783
so he could have some fun.

00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:02.118
This cannot be the deal!

00:52:02.119 --> 00:52:04.454
I cannot be like this
any longer!

00:52:04.455 --> 00:52:05.889
I don't like it!

00:52:05.890 --> 00:52:08.124
You go talk
to your angel friends,
and you fix this.

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:09.894
You fix this for me, okay?

00:52:10.728 --> 00:52:12.630
- I will.
- Thank you!

00:52:13.531 --> 00:52:15.064
Gabriel.

00:52:15.065 --> 00:52:16.533
You've been let go.

00:52:16.534 --> 00:52:18.902
What? I'm fired?

00:52:18.903 --> 00:52:21.638
This is too big a mess
you've created.

00:52:21.639 --> 00:52:23.640
What happens to me?

00:52:23.641 --> 00:52:26.476
You live out this life
as a human.

00:52:26.477 --> 00:52:27.978
There must be another way.

00:52:29.046 --> 00:52:31.715
If Arj decides
to switch back

00:52:31.716 --> 00:52:36.920
and have hope for his life,
then you and Jeff are fine.

00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:39.990
But until then,
you're human.

00:52:41.426 --> 00:52:43.393
I already feel it.

00:52:43.394 --> 00:52:45.061
I'm perspiring.

00:52:45.062 --> 00:52:47.564
I... I need deodorant.

00:52:47.565 --> 00:52:49.866
And my stomach
feels strange.

00:52:49.867 --> 00:52:51.167
I think...

00:52:51.168 --> 00:52:52.637
I'm hungry?

00:52:57.174 --> 00:52:59.810
How will I know
when I'm done chewing?

00:53:01.446 --> 00:53:04.113
Oh, you've never eaten
anything before, huh?

00:53:04.114 --> 00:53:08.285
Um, you know,
I think you'll just know.

00:53:08.286 --> 00:53:10.920
What if I choke?
I've seen it happen a lot.

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:13.624
Just eat
the hamburger, okay?

00:53:23.534 --> 00:53:24.969
- Wow.
- Yeah?

00:53:26.103 --> 00:53:28.238
This is nice.

00:53:28.239 --> 00:53:29.906
It's like nothing
I've experienced.

00:53:29.907 --> 00:53:32.075
Yeah, man.

00:53:32.076 --> 00:53:34.645
No? Have a chicken nuggie.

00:53:42.687 --> 00:53:44.788
There you go!
It happened, see?

00:53:44.789 --> 00:53:46.456
Instinct kicked in.

00:53:46.457 --> 00:53:48.593
- Oh.
- Yeah!

00:53:49.794 --> 00:53:52.396
- I like this even more.
- Yeah.

00:53:52.397 --> 00:53:54.164
- Have some milkshake.
- Mmm.

00:54:01.739 --> 00:54:04.641
Wow.

00:54:04.642 --> 00:54:08.778
Jeff, could you imagine
seeing strawberries
for thousands of years

00:54:08.779 --> 00:54:13.351
but never actually knowing
the sweet taste enclosed
in those magical berries?

00:54:14.051 --> 00:54:15.352
I can't imagine.

00:54:15.353 --> 00:54:17.522
And in all fairness,
that's a chocolate milkshake.

00:54:19.557 --> 00:54:22.326
What are we going to do, Jeff?
I'm scared.

00:54:22.327 --> 00:54:23.427
We don't have any money,

00:54:23.428 --> 00:54:25.829
and I'm already
perspiring a lot.

00:54:25.830 --> 00:54:29.299
So I looked up online
how long the average coma lasts.

00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:32.201
Two weeks.
Not that bad, you know.

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:34.938
So we just got to make
enough money to last
until this guy wakes up.

00:54:34.939 --> 00:54:36.973
Tomorrow, I'll go
to my old office.

00:54:36.974 --> 00:54:39.643
I know everything
about all the companies
they've invested in.

00:54:39.644 --> 00:54:41.277
So, I'll give them
some insight

00:54:41.278 --> 00:54:43.380
that makes me look
like a financial genius.

00:54:43.381 --> 00:54:44.714
They'll hire me on the spot.

00:54:44.715 --> 00:54:46.516
It'll be enough money
for both of us.

00:54:46.517 --> 00:54:48.986
We'll be out
of that motel tomorrow.

00:54:52.790 --> 00:54:53.791
There you go.

00:54:54.359 --> 00:54:55.492
There you go!

00:54:55.493 --> 00:54:57.494
You're a big boy, huh?

00:54:57.495 --> 00:54:59.529
Yeah, I'm a big boy.

00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:00.798
You sure are.

00:55:02.299 --> 00:55:04.902
Let go of me!
Let go of me!

00:55:07.071 --> 00:55:08.972
Did you get the job?

00:55:08.973 --> 00:55:11.007
Does it look like
I got the job?

00:55:11.008 --> 00:55:12.241
No!

00:55:12.242 --> 00:55:14.043
They accused me
of hacking into their files,

00:55:14.044 --> 00:55:16.746
and then they basically
threatened to kill me.

00:55:16.747 --> 00:55:18.416
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

00:55:19.417 --> 00:55:21.351
Chicken nuggie?

00:55:21.352 --> 00:55:25.989
Yes, of course I respect
patient confidentiality.

00:55:25.990 --> 00:55:27.524
I just need to know,

00:55:27.525 --> 00:55:31.227
do you have
any Indian dudes there
that are in a coma?

00:55:31.228 --> 00:55:33.563
Yes, I've actually
called many times.

00:55:33.564 --> 00:55:35.500
Hello? Hello?

00:55:37.668 --> 00:55:38.935
I don't think
they're going to tell me

00:55:38.936 --> 00:55:41.005
any more information
about this.

00:55:41.906 --> 00:55:43.106
It's been three weeks,

00:55:43.107 --> 00:55:45.542
I've applied
for one million jobs.

00:55:45.543 --> 00:55:47.110
I either
don't hear back at all

00:55:47.111 --> 00:55:48.445
or it's a scam
where people just want me

00:55:48.446 --> 00:55:50.780
to send them pictures
of my feet.

00:55:50.781 --> 00:55:52.650
Are you listening
to me, Gabriel?

00:55:53.918 --> 00:55:56.686
Sorry. The Internet
is amazing, Jeff.

00:55:56.687 --> 00:55:58.555
I want
to help you find jobs,

00:55:58.556 --> 00:56:01.458
but I also want to look
at photos of baby elephants.

00:56:02.593 --> 00:56:05.194
Look at this guy,
bathing in a river.

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:06.596
His name's Oliver.

00:56:06.597 --> 00:56:09.265
I cannot financially support
the both of us anymore.

00:56:09.266 --> 00:56:10.967
You have to get
a job, Gabriel.

00:56:10.968 --> 00:56:12.602
- A job?
- Yeah.

00:56:12.603 --> 00:56:15.739
Wow.
Wonder what I want to be.

00:56:15.740 --> 00:56:18.041
An architect, a scientist.

00:56:18.042 --> 00:56:19.510
Maybe I want
to work with animals.

00:56:20.110 --> 00:56:21.144
Oh.

00:56:21.145 --> 00:56:23.213
Maybe I could work
with baby elephants.

00:56:24.014 --> 00:56:25.015
Maybe.

00:56:26.283 --> 00:56:27.451
But probably not.

00:56:27.452 --> 00:56:28.552
Come on, Gabriel.

00:56:28.553 --> 00:56:30.254
You need to move
more fast, please.

00:56:31.856 --> 00:56:32.889
Do we do any other stuff

00:56:32.890 --> 00:56:34.424
or is it just dishes
all night?

00:56:34.425 --> 00:56:36.260
Just washing
dishes all night.

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:42.131
My first check.

00:56:42.132 --> 00:56:44.468
Felipe, my first check.

00:56:44.469 --> 00:56:45.536
Good, Gabe.

00:56:47.371 --> 00:56:49.005
You're shitting me.

00:56:49.006 --> 00:56:51.975
Felipe, there's something
wrong with my check!

00:56:51.976 --> 00:56:54.478
What's wrong
with your check, Gabe?

00:56:54.479 --> 00:56:57.581
There's not enough money.
Where's the money?

00:56:57.582 --> 00:56:59.182
They're paying one number,

00:56:59.183 --> 00:57:02.285
and then taking a lot of money
for all these other things.

00:57:02.286 --> 00:57:03.588
Let me see, Gabe.

00:57:05.255 --> 00:57:08.257
This money goes
to the local government,
federal government,

00:57:08.258 --> 00:57:09.959
your insurance,
and your social security.

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.061
That's why it's less money.

00:57:12.897 --> 00:57:15.131
I can't make enough money
to live off this.

00:57:15.132 --> 00:57:17.033
You may need
to get another job.

00:57:17.034 --> 00:57:18.502
Another job?

00:57:18.503 --> 00:57:21.638
I wash dishes all the time.
When can I do another job?

00:57:21.639 --> 00:57:23.474
I don't know.
I have three jobs.

00:57:26.410 --> 00:57:28.177
- What?
- I work here,

00:57:28.178 --> 00:57:29.846
I'm a mechanic,

00:57:29.847 --> 00:57:33.216
and I do valet parking
at an escape room.

00:57:33.217 --> 00:57:36.553
I thought a job gives me
enough money for all my things

00:57:36.554 --> 00:57:40.156
and some extra money
to spend on fun stuff.

00:57:40.157 --> 00:57:42.760
Sorry, Gabe.
This is how it is.

00:57:53.604 --> 00:57:55.905
- How you feeling?
- I'm good.

00:57:55.906 --> 00:57:59.142
It's a big day tomorrow.
Are you excited?

00:57:59.143 --> 00:58:03.146
- Yeah. Ready to go home.
- That's good.

00:58:03.147 --> 00:58:04.914
So, listen.

00:58:04.915 --> 00:58:06.850
Since you've been here,
there have been two guys

00:58:06.851 --> 00:58:08.818
who've been
asking around about you,

00:58:08.819 --> 00:58:10.654
seemed a little bit shady.

00:58:10.655 --> 00:58:13.590
One, curly hair,
pretty bland.

00:58:13.591 --> 00:58:15.525
The other guy, long hair,

00:58:15.526 --> 00:58:17.561
very attractive.

00:58:17.562 --> 00:58:19.696
He's kinda like a bad boy,
but with a soft touch.

00:58:19.697 --> 00:58:21.230
I know who you're
talking about.

00:58:21.231 --> 00:58:23.700
- Yes, I know them.
- Maybe give them a call.

00:58:23.701 --> 00:58:25.434
They seemed
pretty concerned.

00:58:25.435 --> 00:58:27.436
You could give
the tall one my number.

00:58:27.437 --> 00:58:28.773
That's fine with me.

00:58:31.241 --> 00:58:33.042
Can I ask you something?

00:58:33.043 --> 00:58:35.044
When people have
accidents like this, do...

00:58:35.045 --> 00:58:36.947
Do they ever have
memory issues?

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:44.889
Where is this place?

00:58:46.691 --> 00:58:48.925
"Stone Canyon Road"?

00:58:48.926 --> 00:58:50.561
That's my address.

00:58:51.862 --> 00:58:53.731
"Delivery for Arj"?

00:58:54.531 --> 00:58:56.465
He's out of the coma.

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:58.168
He's out of the coma!

00:59:03.908 --> 00:59:05.208
Jeff?

00:59:05.209 --> 00:59:06.876
The fuck is he doing here?

00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:10.915
He's my Foodzr driver?

00:59:17.855 --> 00:59:19.056
Hey, thanks so much.

00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:21.257
What is
happening right now?

00:59:21.258 --> 00:59:23.627
You're out of the coma
and you're ordering ramen?

00:59:23.628 --> 00:59:25.161
Why didn't you
phone me, Arj?

00:59:25.162 --> 00:59:27.964
They said
this might happen.

00:59:27.965 --> 00:59:30.634
Because of the coma,
I've been having
some memory issues.

00:59:30.635 --> 00:59:32.837
I'm so sorry,
but I don't remember you.

00:59:33.537 --> 00:59:35.504
You don't remember me?

00:59:35.505 --> 00:59:37.675
The pamphlet.
Let me get you a pamphlet.

00:59:44.081 --> 00:59:45.114
Here you go.

00:59:45.115 --> 00:59:47.483
It's called
dissociative memory loss.

00:59:47.484 --> 00:59:51.520
It's due to the medications
they were using to treat me
after the accident.

00:59:51.521 --> 00:59:54.157
It was pretty serious
brain trauma.

00:59:54.158 --> 00:59:55.291
Are you
fucking with me, man?

00:59:55.292 --> 00:59:56.626
Do you actually
not remember me?

00:59:56.627 --> 00:59:58.494
Maybe we can try
to jog my memory.

00:59:58.495 --> 01:00:00.263
- What's your name?
- Jeff!

01:00:00.264 --> 01:00:04.033
Uh, that's not
ringing a bell.

01:00:04.034 --> 01:00:05.434
You don't know who I am?

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:07.937
If you read the pamphlet,
it could be very helpful.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.673
"The duration
of memory loss can vary

01:00:09.674 --> 01:00:12.441
"depending on the specific
cause of the coma.

01:00:12.442 --> 01:00:15.611
"In some cases,
memory may improve
over time with treatment.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.581
"In other cases,
memory loss...

01:00:18.883 --> 01:00:20.217
"may be permanent."

01:00:20.885 --> 01:00:22.285
Wow.

01:00:22.286 --> 01:00:23.587
That's no bueno.

01:00:25.522 --> 01:00:27.658
Did you just say,
"That's no bueno"?

01:00:28.826 --> 01:00:31.394
No fucking shit,
it's no bueno!

01:00:31.395 --> 01:00:35.398
It's muy, muy,
muy no bueno, Gabriel.

01:00:35.399 --> 01:00:37.734
You know what?
I want to talk to God.

01:00:37.735 --> 01:00:39.903
Get me God.
I want a meeting
with God right now.

01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:41.237
That's above
my pay grade.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:42.739
Well, then who's your boss?
Who do you work for?

01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:44.140
Martha.

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:45.541
Martha?

01:00:45.542 --> 01:00:47.877
You work for an angel
named Martha?

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:49.146
Martha.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:51.647
What has happened
to you, Gabriel?

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:52.916
You've just given up.

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:54.317
You're smoking
cigarettes now?

01:00:54.318 --> 01:00:57.922
Leave me alone, Jeff.
I like it. It's all I have.

01:00:59.757 --> 01:01:01.224
Please don't
give up on me.

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:03.893
Do you want to wash dishes
and smoke cigarettes

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.428
or do you want
to get your wings back?

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:08.632
You can get them back, man.
I know you can. Just think!

01:01:13.804 --> 01:01:15.671
His friend Elena.

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:17.506
She was the one I was
supposed to help originally,

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:20.509
but I didn't,
and she went off her path.

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:23.546
Maybe I can help her
get back on her path

01:01:23.547 --> 01:01:26.215
and that'll help Arj
get back on his path.

01:01:26.216 --> 01:01:27.884
And then he'll want
to switch back.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:30.253
And then I'll get
my wings back.

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:32.455
And then you'll get
your life back!

01:01:32.456 --> 01:01:34.791
That's what I want.
I knew you could do it, man!

01:01:34.792 --> 01:01:36.192
Good job. You can
do this, Gabriel.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.426
- Yes, yes.
- Hey, Gabriel,

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:38.895
what are you doing there?
Your break is over.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:40.429
I need you, please.

01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:43.366
- You need to come back
to the restaurant.
- Okay, Felipe.

01:01:43.367 --> 01:01:44.902
I got to finish
my shift first.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.039
Thanks, man.

01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:04.387
That right there,
that's the truth.

01:02:04.388 --> 01:02:06.289
I had a union
at my last job,

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:07.824
all they did was take money
out our checks,

01:02:07.825 --> 01:02:10.059
ain't do nothing for us.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:12.628
But, Kirby,
how could you say that
when that's not even us?

01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:14.898
Sounds like
the same nonsense to me.

01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:17.466
If that's not the truth,
what is?

01:02:17.467 --> 01:02:19.903
The truth is that one
of our team members

01:02:19.904 --> 01:02:22.605
had a panic attack
on the floor last week,

01:02:22.606 --> 01:02:24.140
picking and choosing
which bills to pay,

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.809
worried about
getting evicted.

01:02:25.810 --> 01:02:27.544
And I know
she's not the only one
that has to deal with this.

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:29.846
I mean, guys,
they're giving us

01:02:29.847 --> 01:02:31.981
more and more
double shifts,

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:34.450
less training,
more responsibilities.

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:35.785
And what do we get for it?

01:02:35.786 --> 01:02:38.587
Twenty-five cents a raise
and a pat on the back?

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:42.325
It is very possible for this
place to take care of itself
and the people in it,

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:43.759
but they keep giving us
less and less

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:46.595
because we're okay
taking crumbs.

01:02:46.596 --> 01:02:48.297
So what's it going to be?

01:02:48.298 --> 01:02:50.533
Are we going
to take the crumbs?

01:02:50.534 --> 01:02:53.436
Or are we going
to fuck 'em up?

01:02:55.940 --> 01:02:56.941
Yeah!

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:00.609
And you know what else?

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:04.714
Why do we need to give money
to taxes and social security?

01:03:05.916 --> 01:03:09.018
That money needs
to go to fun stuff,

01:03:09.019 --> 01:03:11.755
like chicken nuggies
and milkshakes.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:15.959
Milkshakes are good,
chicken nuggies are good.

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:17.894
That's the truth.

01:03:17.895 --> 01:03:19.295
And dogs.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.464
I petted a dog
for the first time
the other day.

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:24.133
Maybe they need
to get benefits, too.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.335
They give so much joy,
and what do they get?

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:28.472
A pat on the head
and a biscuit.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:31.140
It's not enough!

01:03:31.141 --> 01:03:33.309
We can do better.

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:36.345
And Hardware Heaven
can do better.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:40.183
For us
and for the dogs.

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:42.651
Hey, brother.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.687
What department
you work in?

01:03:44.688 --> 01:03:47.023
Oh, I don't work here.

01:03:47.024 --> 01:03:48.391
I'm a dishwasher

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:50.094
at an all-you-can-eat
Korean barbecue restaurant.

01:03:51.661 --> 01:03:53.497
Am I not supposed
to be here?

01:04:05.575 --> 01:04:06.676
Yes.

01:04:08.112 --> 01:04:09.113
No.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.116
No.

01:04:13.150 --> 01:04:14.284
No.

01:04:15.252 --> 01:04:16.286
No.

01:04:17.354 --> 01:04:18.388
No.

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:20.057
No.

01:04:43.713 --> 01:04:44.915
You're okay, Gabe?

01:04:46.683 --> 01:04:48.052
Hey, Felipe.

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:51.355
No, I'm not.

01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:54.925
I'm just sad.

01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.261
I messed things up.

01:04:58.262 --> 01:05:00.964
That's why I got fired
from my last job.

01:05:00.965 --> 01:05:02.232
What did you did?

01:05:03.567 --> 01:05:05.668
I was an angel.

01:05:05.669 --> 01:05:09.638
I saved people when they were
texting and driving.

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:11.942
Oh, cool, nice.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.144
Come on, Gabriel.

01:05:15.145 --> 01:05:17.280
Maybe you can
put your drink down.

01:05:17.281 --> 01:05:19.783
You can't be like this.
What do you want?

01:05:27.491 --> 01:05:29.693
I want my old job back.

01:05:31.861 --> 01:05:34.830
I want to fix
what I messed up.

01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:36.400
Then let's do it.

01:05:37.567 --> 01:05:40.769
You're a handsome,
sweet man.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:44.640
I believe in you,
but you're in a bad place.

01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:46.543
We need
to boost your spirits.

01:05:48.012 --> 01:05:50.880
What are you going to do
tonight after your shift?

01:05:52.516 --> 01:05:55.184
I don't know. Why?

01:05:55.185 --> 01:05:56.619
Let's go dancing.

01:05:57.988 --> 01:05:59.823
What do I do?
Just follow me.

01:06:04.028 --> 01:06:04.995
Have some tacos.

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:09.933
Wow!

01:06:12.869 --> 01:06:14.337
You were
texting and driving.

01:06:14.338 --> 01:06:15.638
What?

01:06:21.111 --> 01:06:23.979
Hey, Gabriel, that's my wife.
Don't make me get a hose.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.149
Calm down.
That's my viejo.

01:06:28.218 --> 01:06:29.585
Thank you, Gabe.

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:31.455
Bye.

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:34.291
I saved her.

01:06:41.631 --> 01:06:43.467
This motherfucker
stole my vacation.

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:45.934
I hope you're having fun.

01:06:49.239 --> 01:06:51.274
"Dear valued
Foodzr associate,

01:06:51.275 --> 01:06:54.910
"next week, we are shifting
to primarily robo delivery.

01:06:54.911 --> 01:06:57.180
"Your rating does not
meet our threshold"?

01:06:57.181 --> 01:07:01.685
"Your account is
terminated immediately."

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:07.423
Fuck!

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:09.393
- Jeff?
- Yeah!

01:07:10.694 --> 01:07:11.795
What's wrong?

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.034
This is too hard, man.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:20.636
Like, how do
people do this?

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:23.939
How is everyone
not just miserable

01:07:23.940 --> 01:07:27.976
and angry all the time?

01:07:27.977 --> 01:07:29.278
I don't even
have it that bad,

01:07:29.279 --> 01:07:31.980
and I'm barely hanging on
by a thread here.

01:07:31.981 --> 01:07:36.252
In my old life,
all I did was go on vacation,

01:07:36.253 --> 01:07:41.090
and attend very, very easy
and pleasant Zoom meetings.

01:07:41.091 --> 01:07:43.393
I want that back!

01:07:45.495 --> 01:07:47.496
Shit, it's the pigs.

01:07:47.497 --> 01:07:50.299
Just what we fucking need!

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:52.401
Explain to me
how I get my car back?

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:53.502
Go down to the impound lot,

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:55.271
pay all of your unpaid
parking tickets

01:07:55.272 --> 01:07:56.772
and the impound fee.

01:07:56.773 --> 01:08:00.109
Each day your car stays there,
impound fee goes up.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.246
Great system. Thank you.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:07.916
This same thing
happened to Arj.

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:09.818
What? What do you mean?

01:08:09.819 --> 01:08:12.155
After you fired him,
he went to donate plasma

01:08:12.156 --> 01:08:13.656
and then he passed out
at a Denny's,

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:16.025
and when he woke up,
his car was towed.

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:18.862
Weird.

01:08:21.231 --> 01:08:22.532
What are we going to do?

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:26.535
I really don't know, man.

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:30.038
We have nowhere to live.
I have no job now.

01:08:30.039 --> 01:08:32.309
We just really need
some money.

01:08:43.253 --> 01:08:45.721
- What?
- Pretty Baby.

01:08:45.722 --> 01:08:46.855
My watches.

01:08:46.856 --> 01:08:48.857
We can get my watches!

01:08:48.858 --> 01:08:50.326
- Your watches?
- Yeah!

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:51.627
Let's go!

01:08:54.198 --> 01:08:55.932
What's going on here?

01:08:56.566 --> 01:08:57.934
It's my birthday.

01:08:58.735 --> 01:08:59.802
Oh.

01:08:59.803 --> 01:09:00.869
Happy birthday.

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:02.471
No, it's Arj's
birthday now,

01:09:02.472 --> 01:09:04.840
he stole
my 40th birthday party!

01:09:04.841 --> 01:09:05.975
I don't even know
my birthday.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:10.246
Are we still going to be able
to get the watches?

01:09:10.247 --> 01:09:12.047
Yeah, he doesn't
remember who we are.

01:09:12.048 --> 01:09:13.816
It's fine.
This is actually good.

01:09:13.817 --> 01:09:14.883
I sneak upstairs.

01:09:14.884 --> 01:09:16.419
I still remember the code
to the safe.

01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:18.922
If I can get Pretty Baby,
we're set for life.

01:09:20.224 --> 01:09:23.726
I still feel bad about
the stealing.

01:09:23.727 --> 01:09:28.163
It's not stealing
because all this is mine!

01:09:28.164 --> 01:09:29.299
Come on!

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.635
That's true.

01:09:34.771 --> 01:09:36.439

to be kidding me.

01:09:38.875 --> 01:09:40.776

Jeff, the watches.

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:53.457
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:56.759
There's some guys
guarding the stairs.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.627
I'm going to do a lap,
try to wait them out,

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:00.396
maybe hit that buffet table.

01:10:00.397 --> 01:10:01.730
He even stole my caterer!

01:10:01.731 --> 01:10:03.266
Goddamn it.

01:10:03.267 --> 01:10:04.533

I'll see you later,
Leonard.

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:27.155
His friend from the gym?

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.825
Hello! How are you?

01:10:30.327 --> 01:10:32.127
I'm good.

01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:35.298

birthday, it's your birthday!

Arj's dad?

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:42.438
Come on, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:10:42.439 --> 01:10:44.408
Let's go! Let's go!

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:47.176
Jeff?

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.146
No, Tanner,
what the fuck are you doing?

01:10:51.147 --> 01:10:53.316
Don't lean on the art, man!

01:10:53.317 --> 01:10:56.118
This is someone's painting,
for Christ's sakes.

01:10:56.119 --> 01:10:57.686
Why was I friends
with these assholes?

01:10:57.687 --> 01:10:59.588
Yo, Linda, what's up?

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:01.790
Hey, do I know you?

01:11:01.791 --> 01:11:03.191
Oh, um,

01:11:03.192 --> 01:11:05.260
let's just say we knew
each other in another life.

01:11:05.261 --> 01:11:06.629
- Sick.
- Yeah.

01:11:06.630 --> 01:11:09.698
Do you know that guy,
he's got the long hair,

01:11:09.699 --> 01:11:10.799
- kinda tall.
- Yes. Uh-huh.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.167
Yeah, Gabriel.
He's an angel.

01:11:12.168 --> 01:11:13.802
- He's fucking hot.
- Yeah.

01:11:13.803 --> 01:11:15.638
I'm going to go
sit on his face.

01:11:15.639 --> 01:11:18.040
That will
really confuse him.

01:11:18.041 --> 01:11:20.043
Is Jeff here?

01:11:20.444 --> 01:11:22.044
Oh, no.

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:23.546
But we got some
mushroom chocolates, dude.
You want a nibble?

01:11:23.547 --> 01:11:26.115
- Ooh, chocolate.
- Let's go.

01:11:27.917 --> 01:11:28.952
Thanks.

01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:31.520
Tastes funky.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:33.121
- Can I have another one?
- Sure.

01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:34.657
Go off, king.

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:36.959
Mmm.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.799
Elena?

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.167
What are you doing here?

01:11:45.168 --> 01:11:48.537
I am currently serving
some salmon crostini.

01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:49.705
Happy birthday.

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:52.007
- Thanks. But what's...
- I started working

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:53.642
for this catering company
on the side.

01:11:53.643 --> 01:11:56.012
I didn't know it was
your address till I got
to the house.

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.881
- Oh.
- I got to get back to work.

01:11:58.882 --> 01:12:00.749
W...

01:12:00.750 --> 01:12:02.586
Nice dance moves,
by the way.

01:12:07.891 --> 01:12:09.659
So, how do you know Arj?

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.363
Wow.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.800
- I don't know if I can say.
- Oh.

01:12:17.601 --> 01:12:18.667
Can you keep a secret?

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.669
Oh, I love secrets.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:23.772
Well, I used
to be an angel.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:25.674
And I switched Arj's life

01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:27.443
- with Jeff's life.
- Oh.

01:12:27.444 --> 01:12:30.012
But then Arj didn't
want to go back,

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:33.616
and that's how I lost my wings
and became human.

01:12:33.617 --> 01:12:35.283
Oh, my God.

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:37.119
Are we role-playing
right now?

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.921
I want you so bad.

01:12:38.922 --> 01:12:40.122
- No.
- Huh?

01:12:40.123 --> 01:12:42.057
Oh. I got to go find Jeff.

01:12:42.058 --> 01:12:44.259
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Forget about Jeff.

01:12:44.260 --> 01:12:46.229
Tell me more secrets.

01:12:51.167 --> 01:12:53.936
Yo. What you doing here?
You okay?

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:57.205
I shouldn't
be here, Leonard.

01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:00.909
This house, this party,
it's not mine.

01:13:00.910 --> 01:13:02.578
It's like I stole it
from someone else.

01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:05.380
- The Native Americans?
- No, not them.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.650
Yo, anybody got
a setup like this,

01:13:07.651 --> 01:13:09.318
they stole it from somebody.

01:13:11.354 --> 01:13:13.221
Hey, did you see that server
that had long hair?

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.657
- The Black girl?
- Yeah.

01:13:14.658 --> 01:13:16.258
What, 'cause I'm Black,
you think I know where she is?

01:13:16.259 --> 01:13:17.726
You think I can track
all the Black people
at your party?

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.261
That's not what I meant.

01:13:19.262 --> 01:13:21.229
We went out a while ago.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:25.168
She's great.
But I'm just too fancy.

01:13:26.335 --> 01:13:27.871
It kinda pulled us apart.

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:29.906
You are fancy.

01:13:30.807 --> 01:13:32.441
But you got heart.

01:13:32.442 --> 01:13:35.478
When you saw me, I was just
some dude on the street.

01:13:35.479 --> 01:13:37.680
And you got me an apartment.

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:39.648
You got me
a custom-made tuxedo.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:41.149
I'm over here eating
salmon cros...

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:42.485
cros... crossa...

01:13:42.486 --> 01:13:45.253
I can't even pronounce
the things I'm eating.

01:13:45.254 --> 01:13:47.957
Maybe she just don't know
who you really are.

01:13:58.668 --> 01:13:59.736
Hey.

01:14:01.571 --> 01:14:02.639
Hey!

01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:05.841
Your party kinda winded down.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:09.245
Yeah, I guess it did.

01:14:10.179 --> 01:14:13.716
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:13.717 --> 01:14:15.618
What are you doing now?
Do you want to hang out
for a minute?

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:18.221
I got to clean up.

01:14:19.455 --> 01:14:21.457
It looks like
they're pretty much done.

01:14:22.759 --> 01:14:25.060
Come on, what,
do you hate me now?

01:14:25.061 --> 01:14:26.730
No, I don't hate you.

01:14:29.365 --> 01:14:30.465
You know, you're
the only person here

01:14:30.466 --> 01:14:31.534
I wanted to hang out with,

01:14:31.535 --> 01:14:35.170
and everyone else
is finally gone.

01:14:35.171 --> 01:14:36.305
What do you say?

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:44.113
You want to dance?
We still got the disco floor.

01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:01.730
You were right.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:04.232
We should've gone to Paris.

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:06.268
I thought I could
make a difference,

01:15:06.269 --> 01:15:09.138
but, uh,
it was a waste of time.

01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:12.175
That's not true.

01:15:13.442 --> 01:15:14.477
I lost.

01:15:16.479 --> 01:15:18.948
So what's your answer?
Give up?

01:15:21.284 --> 01:15:23.285
You're in a huge house
with a pool

01:15:23.286 --> 01:15:26.790
telling me not to give up,
to fight.

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:30.225
How can I fight
a giant corporation

01:15:30.226 --> 01:15:32.328
when I'm fighting
just to get by?

01:15:33.997 --> 01:15:35.798
My rent went up.

01:15:35.799 --> 01:15:37.400
I lost my apartment. I...

01:15:38.768 --> 01:15:41.637
I'm sleeping
in my cousin's car, Arj.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.310
You'll never
believe me, but...

01:15:48.311 --> 01:15:51.046
...I've been there.

01:15:51.047 --> 01:15:56.084
Even if you have,
you're here now.

01:15:56.085 --> 01:15:57.587
And it's beautiful.

01:15:59.355 --> 01:16:01.757
Damn! I want to go.

01:16:01.758 --> 01:16:03.760
I want to go
to Paris, but...

01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:11.367
I know what's going on
on the ground down there.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:16.138
And instead
of being up here

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:17.906
drinking the fanciest
wine you got,

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:20.076
I guess I'd rather
be down there...

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:24.280
fighting to get
more people up here,

01:16:25.381 --> 01:16:27.016
rather than just myself.

01:16:33.222 --> 01:16:34.624
I got to go.

01:17:48.898 --> 01:17:50.266
Pretty Baby.

01:18:02.011 --> 01:18:04.212
You shot me!

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:07.549
Oh, no, Jeff! Are you okay?

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:09.051
Why'd you shoot me?

01:18:09.052 --> 01:18:11.119
You said, "Don't hesitate.
Shoot first, questions later."

01:18:11.120 --> 01:18:13.723
I thought you were
a home invader on meth!

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:15.825
I said that?

01:18:16.625 --> 01:18:18.193
You remember me?

01:18:18.194 --> 01:18:21.063
When I brought you
that ramen and gyoza,
you remembered me!

01:18:21.064 --> 01:18:22.697
- I knew it!
- I'm so sorry!

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:23.899
I'm going to call 911!

01:18:23.900 --> 01:18:25.200
- I'm doing that now!
- You fucking asshole.

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:27.736
I knew it! You lied to me
and you shot me!

01:18:27.737 --> 01:18:29.104
You're a bad man, Arj!

01:18:29.105 --> 01:18:31.774
I can't find my phone!

01:18:31.775 --> 01:18:32.941
Use mine!

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:36.711
Arj?

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:37.980
Jeff, are you okay?

01:18:37.981 --> 01:18:40.282
Gabriel, call an angel
that deals with gunshots!

01:18:40.283 --> 01:18:41.649
I have no way
to contact them,

01:18:41.650 --> 01:18:43.585
and they usually work
in a different part of town.

01:18:43.586 --> 01:18:44.920
I brought you
into my life,

01:18:44.921 --> 01:18:47.222
I gave you burrata,

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:49.425
and then you took
everything from me.

01:18:51.861 --> 01:18:56.799
You lied to me,
you stole all my dance moves,

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:58.201
and then you shot me.

01:19:00.369 --> 01:19:02.905
I'm sorry, man.
Why'd you have a gun
in the first place?

01:19:02.906 --> 01:19:05.307
Well, I didn't think I'd be
the one who'd get shot by it.

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:06.909
Statistically,
you'd be surprised.

01:19:06.910 --> 01:19:09.879
Okay, not now.
Is that all right?

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:12.415
Why did you lie to me, Arj?

01:19:14.217 --> 01:19:16.151
My life is hard.

01:19:16.152 --> 01:19:18.787
Yours is
really easy and fun.

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:19.889
I couldn't go back.

01:19:20.990 --> 01:19:24.759
But it's gone on
long enough.

01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.696
Gabriel,
how do I switch back?

01:19:28.898 --> 01:19:30.266
Well, you've told me.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.467
If you want
to switch back

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:33.736
to your old life,
it should happen.

01:19:34.603 --> 01:19:36.138
Well, why isn't it happening?

01:19:36.139 --> 01:19:39.674
You want to go back
because you feel guilty
about Jeff,

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:44.247
but you still don't feel
your life, your real life,
is worth living.

01:19:44.948 --> 01:19:47.215
You don't have hope.

01:19:47.216 --> 01:19:50.218
Just to be clear, he does not
only have to want to go back,

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:52.888
which was what I thought
we've been going for
this whole time,

01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:54.389
he has to be
psyched about it?

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:55.790
Yes.

01:19:55.791 --> 01:19:57.460
Well, why would
that ever happen?

01:19:58.194 --> 01:20:00.028
No offense.

01:20:00.029 --> 01:20:02.330
I don't know
what else we can do.

01:20:02.331 --> 01:20:04.900
This has been
a very stressful week.

01:20:04.901 --> 01:20:06.602
Maybe we go back
to my house?

01:20:07.436 --> 01:20:08.671
Technically, your house.

01:20:09.772 --> 01:20:11.274
Our house?

01:20:12.408 --> 01:20:13.576
For now.

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:15.643
Can I come?

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:16.913
Yes.

01:20:19.782 --> 01:20:20.850
Like it?

01:20:21.951 --> 01:20:22.952
Yeah.

01:20:23.887 --> 01:20:25.720
I needed this.

01:20:25.721 --> 01:20:29.424
It's the back and forth that
really makes the experience.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:30.692
Yeah.

01:20:30.693 --> 01:20:33.061
Shall we plunge?

01:20:33.062 --> 01:20:34.729
What's that?

01:20:34.730 --> 01:20:36.331
Let's go! Let's go!

01:20:38.334 --> 01:20:39.667
You did it, two minutes!

01:20:39.668 --> 01:20:41.836
- You did it, you did it!
- Yeah, Gabriel! Let's go!

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.771
- I'm getting in, too.
- Yep.

01:20:43.772 --> 01:20:45.107
BY SABRINA PLAYING)

01:20:45.108 --> 01:20:47.675
Oh, fuck,
I've been shot!

01:20:47.676 --> 01:20:49.644
I shouldn't do this.
I shouldn't do this.

You actually learned
to drive the Porsche?

01:21:04.193 --> 01:21:05.627
Yeah. I mean,
I know how to drive manual.

01:21:05.628 --> 01:21:06.895
You got to...
You got to learn.
I'll teach you.

01:21:06.896 --> 01:21:09.298
I do. Please do.
It looks so fun.

01:21:10.499 --> 01:21:11.901
Have a nice swim?

01:21:13.202 --> 01:21:14.970
Martha.

01:21:14.971 --> 01:21:17.139
Yeah, I guess.

01:21:19.042 --> 01:21:23.745
So, now Arj wants to go back,
but he still can't.

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:25.713
Wow.

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:29.117
I gave you
the easiest assignment.

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:31.153
All you had to do was
give someone a nudge,

01:21:31.154 --> 01:21:34.256
they look right at the road,
and you were done for the day.

01:21:34.257 --> 01:21:35.657
I know.

01:21:35.658 --> 01:21:37.425
I just thought
I could do more.

01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:39.661
Oh, you certainly
have done more.

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:42.931
You've been washing dishes,
eating chicken nuggies,

01:21:42.932 --> 01:21:46.334
smoking, drinking,
making speeches.

01:21:46.335 --> 01:21:48.603
Oh, I've seen it all.

01:21:48.604 --> 01:21:51.606
How do I get him to have
hope for his life?

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:53.175
I lived like he did,

01:21:53.176 --> 01:21:56.244
I understand now why he didn't
have hope in the first place.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:57.880
Gabriel...

01:21:59.215 --> 01:22:02.584
sometimes a lost soul
doesn't need an angel.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:04.453
It just needs
another person.

01:22:06.222 --> 01:22:08.024
I don't understand.

01:22:09.058 --> 01:22:10.093
I know.

01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:12.395
But I have hope.

01:22:13.562 --> 01:22:14.763
Hey, Gabriel!

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:17.665
You hungry?

01:22:17.666 --> 01:22:20.036
- Always.
- Let's eat.

01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:34.316
My two favorite things
since I've been a human

01:22:34.317 --> 01:22:37.685
are dancing and tacos.

01:22:37.686 --> 01:22:41.489
- I've been a human way longer,
still two of my favorites.
- Mine too.

01:22:41.490 --> 01:22:44.093
Elena?

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:47.195
Hey. One second.

01:22:47.196 --> 01:22:49.364
- How's it going?
- Uh, I'm good.

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:52.467
I'm just grabbing some tacos
with some pals. How are you?

01:22:52.468 --> 01:22:54.569
Good. Here with
the Hardware Heaven crew.

01:22:54.570 --> 01:22:56.571
We just had a meeting
and grabbing a bite to eat.

01:22:56.572 --> 01:22:58.173
A meeting?

01:22:58.174 --> 01:23:00.175
We're going
to give it another go
at organizing the store.

01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:01.809
You are?

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:03.211
Yeah.

01:23:03.212 --> 01:23:05.913
I know I was down about it,
you know, last we talked.

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.082
But I don't know, man,

01:23:07.083 --> 01:23:09.517
I just realized
that change is difficult.

01:23:09.518 --> 01:23:11.653
You're changing something,
you know.

01:23:11.654 --> 01:23:13.221
And no, we won't
win right away,

01:23:13.222 --> 01:23:14.889
but you keep fighting

01:23:14.890 --> 01:23:16.792
and fighting
and fighting, and...

01:23:18.127 --> 01:23:20.428
Because of that,
you eventually do.

01:23:20.429 --> 01:23:21.864
That's what I believe.

01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:26.534
We're going to grab
a drink after this.

01:23:26.535 --> 01:23:28.570
Do you know
any good spots nearby?

01:23:28.571 --> 01:23:29.805
I know one.

01:23:42.351 --> 01:23:43.585
Hey!

01:23:43.586 --> 01:23:44.719
I remember
where I know you from.

01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.020
You broke into
the break room.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.622
Uh, milkshake
and chicken nuggies guy.

01:23:47.623 --> 01:23:49.557
- That's you, right?
- Yeah, that's me.

01:23:49.558 --> 01:23:50.626
How's it going?

01:23:51.194 --> 01:23:52.195
Good.

01:23:56.599 --> 01:23:58.700
Whoa. Look at Gabriel go.

01:23:58.701 --> 01:24:02.070
He's got some moves.
He really got into cumbia.

01:24:02.071 --> 01:24:04.473
Everyone learned
to dance except me.

01:24:26.061 --> 01:24:27.062
Gabriel.

01:24:28.531 --> 01:24:29.932
What's wrong?

01:24:33.369 --> 01:24:35.103
I'm a failure.

01:24:35.104 --> 01:24:38.906
I've put you and Jeff
in a terrible situation.

01:24:38.907 --> 01:24:40.608
It's all my fault.

01:24:40.609 --> 01:24:44.078
What? None of that's true.
You were just trying to help.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.348
My boss told me
I wasn't ready,

01:24:46.349 --> 01:24:48.050
and she knew the truth.

01:24:49.152 --> 01:24:50.219
What truth?

01:24:52.188 --> 01:24:53.788
That I'm kind of a dum-dum.

01:24:53.789 --> 01:24:55.923
A dum-dum?
You're not a dum-dum.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.992
I'm a dum-dum,
and I give up.

01:24:57.993 --> 01:24:59.327
You can't give up.

01:24:59.328 --> 01:25:02.096
You did.

01:25:02.097 --> 01:25:05.833
But, Gabriel, I lost my job,
I lost my apartment.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:07.202
I lost my job.

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:09.437
I used to be
a celestial being,

01:25:09.438 --> 01:25:11.839
and now I'm a chain-smoker.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.309
I'm addicted to nicotine.

01:25:14.310 --> 01:25:16.978
Yeah, but it's not over,
is it?

01:25:16.979 --> 01:25:18.813
I mean, you came down
to show me

01:25:18.814 --> 01:25:20.715
that my life's
worth living.

01:25:20.716 --> 01:25:22.116
Come on, let's go.

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:24.118
I tried, Arj.

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:25.553
But it seems
you prefer to live

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:27.655
in a giant mansion
with a pool

01:25:27.656 --> 01:25:31.493
to sleeping in your car
and eating protein bars.

01:25:31.494 --> 01:25:33.728
But, Gabriel, I never
wanted all that stuff.

01:25:33.729 --> 01:25:36.398
I just wanted enough,
enough to be comfortable,

01:25:36.399 --> 01:25:39.801
to not feel like I was
struggling all the time.

01:25:39.802 --> 01:25:44.206
If I go back,
will I have my car,
a job, anything?

01:25:44.207 --> 01:25:47.475
No to all those things.

01:25:47.476 --> 01:25:49.278
Well, that's pretty scary.

01:25:52.581 --> 01:25:55.483
When I got fired,
I was scared, too.

01:25:55.484 --> 01:25:58.186
I didn't know
what was going to happen.

01:25:58.187 --> 01:25:59.788
And a lot of times,
it wasn't fun.

01:26:01.657 --> 01:26:03.991
Sleeping in your car
wasn't fun,

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:08.597
being hungry wasn't fun,
washing dishes wasn't fun.

01:26:09.131 --> 01:26:10.132
But...

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.736
I love being human.

01:26:14.737 --> 01:26:19.274
I love dancing, I love tacos,
I love Felipe, I love Jeff.

01:26:19.275 --> 01:26:21.009
And I love you.

01:26:24.146 --> 01:26:26.047
If I go back,
what happens to you?

01:26:26.048 --> 01:26:27.682
Will I ever see you again?

01:26:27.683 --> 01:26:29.183
No.

01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:32.054
My job would be done,
I'll be an angel again.

01:26:33.322 --> 01:26:36.224
No more tacos.

01:26:36.225 --> 01:26:38.494
Maybe I'll leave one out
for you, just in case.

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:45.933
What?

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:48.803
One time,
I took my dad for tacos,

01:26:48.804 --> 01:26:50.538
and I got him this shirt
for his birthday,

01:26:50.539 --> 01:26:52.474
and he just spilled
green sauce all over it.

01:26:52.475 --> 01:26:55.877
Just completely ruined
the shirt, like a little kid.

01:26:55.878 --> 01:26:57.745
And he still
wears it sometimes,

01:26:57.746 --> 01:26:59.882
even with all the stains,
'cause I got it for him.

01:27:02.184 --> 01:27:04.218
He doesn't know
who I am, Gabriel.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:05.953
He just thinks
I'm some random rich guy

01:27:05.954 --> 01:27:08.290
that gave him a bunch of money
and got him a house.

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:09.957
Why did he let you do that?

01:27:09.958 --> 01:27:13.127
I told him he won a contest
'cause he had a cool mustache.

01:27:13.128 --> 01:27:14.397
Oh.

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:20.968
- I like this, too.
- What?

01:27:20.969 --> 01:27:23.838
Being with you, laughing.

01:27:23.839 --> 01:27:26.908
It's one of the best parts
of being human.

01:27:26.909 --> 01:27:28.243
It is.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:34.248
I just wish
you had a different angel.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.784
Azrael would never
have let this happen.

01:27:36.785 --> 01:27:38.353
Who's he?

01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:43.825
He's a great angel,
has giant wings, guides people.

01:27:43.826 --> 01:27:45.993
He's a rock star.

01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:48.863
I think I'd rather
have the guy that's
really into cumbia,

01:27:48.864 --> 01:27:50.698
chicken nuggies
and psychedelics.

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:53.101
You're just saying that
'cause I'm right here.

01:27:54.102 --> 01:27:56.103
Nope.

01:27:56.104 --> 01:27:58.206
I'm saying it
'cause it's true.

01:27:58.874 --> 01:28:00.642
You're my angel.

01:28:00.643 --> 01:28:02.844
And you're not Azrael.
You're Gabriel.

01:28:02.845 --> 01:28:05.347
And you know what?
I love Gabriel.

01:28:05.348 --> 01:28:06.749
I prefer Gabriel.

01:28:09.217 --> 01:28:10.652
And I'm not Jeff.

01:28:10.653 --> 01:28:12.454
I'm Arj.

01:28:12.455 --> 01:28:14.423
And things aren't
going well right now,

01:28:15.624 --> 01:28:17.224
but I got to try.

01:28:17.225 --> 01:28:19.328
I want to see
where it goes, as me.

01:28:20.863 --> 01:28:22.297
As Arj.

01:28:26.935 --> 01:28:29.004
I think
my life's worth living.

01:28:32.941 --> 01:28:33.976
Hey, yo.

01:28:36.211 --> 01:28:38.013
Are you okay?

01:28:39.748 --> 01:28:41.517
Do you need
a ride somewhere?

01:28:42.751 --> 01:28:44.251
What?

01:28:44.252 --> 01:28:45.954
Your car got towed, right?

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:49.557
- Yeah.
- Okay, I got you.

01:28:49.558 --> 01:28:51.259
Just let me know.

01:28:53.396 --> 01:28:54.862
Thanks.

01:28:54.863 --> 01:28:56.432
You bet.

01:29:50.986 --> 01:29:52.754
- Hello.
- Dad?

01:29:52.755 --> 01:29:55.322
Hey, how you doing?

01:29:55.323 --> 01:29:56.925
I'm good.

01:29:58.727 --> 01:30:01.096
Actually, uh,
I'm not good.

01:30:02.465 --> 01:30:04.999
I uh... I didn't
get a new place,

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.637
and, uh, I'm still
struggling to find a job.

01:30:09.638 --> 01:30:11.273
It's just bad out there.

01:30:12.908 --> 01:30:15.276
A lot of people
are having a hard time,

01:30:15.277 --> 01:30:17.812
but you're going to be okay.

01:30:17.813 --> 01:30:19.747
I believe in you.

01:30:19.748 --> 01:30:21.282
Thanks.

01:30:21.283 --> 01:30:24.151
Why did you
lie before, though?

01:30:24.152 --> 01:30:26.988
I don't know.
I guess I was embarrassed.

01:30:26.989 --> 01:30:28.089
You're always
talking about Naveen

01:30:28.090 --> 01:30:29.624
and how much money
he's making and...

01:30:29.625 --> 01:30:33.027
Oh, no. Naveen is
in big trouble now.

01:30:33.028 --> 01:30:36.163
- What?
- He's being audited
for tax evasion.

01:30:36.164 --> 01:30:39.300
He and his friends
were a bunch of crooks.

01:30:39.301 --> 01:30:40.434
This is going
to sound weird,

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.705
but I'm really happy
to hear that.

01:30:43.739 --> 01:30:45.439
And, Jeff,
before we start,

01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.974
you wanted to bring
something up about Foodzr?

01:30:46.975 --> 01:30:48.310
Oh, I sure did.

01:30:50.045 --> 01:30:52.680
We have to start treating
these delivery drivers better.

01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:54.281
I'm talking benefits,

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.283
a definite redesign
of that rating system,

01:30:56.284 --> 01:30:58.185
and we are going to start
paying them more,

01:30:58.186 --> 01:30:59.487
way fucking more.

01:30:59.488 --> 01:31:01.989
Why would we do that?

01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:04.158
If they want to make more money,
they can just get a better job.

01:31:04.159 --> 01:31:05.226
You know what I mean?

01:31:05.227 --> 01:31:06.894
We can't all live
the good life.

01:31:06.895 --> 01:31:08.129
Yeah.

01:31:08.130 --> 01:31:10.998
But the main reason
we all have it so good

01:31:10.999 --> 01:31:12.667
is 'cause there's
a shit ton of people

01:31:12.668 --> 01:31:15.336
that have it bad, very bad.

01:31:15.337 --> 01:31:17.071
And we need them
to have it bad

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:20.307
because it's what allows us
to have it so good.

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:21.676
But you know what?

01:31:21.677 --> 01:31:24.245
There is way more of them
than there is of you.

01:31:24.246 --> 01:31:26.213
And one day,
they're going to get pissed,

01:31:26.214 --> 01:31:27.682
and they're going
to get organized,

01:31:27.683 --> 01:31:30.251
and they are going
to burn down your fucking sauna

01:31:30.252 --> 01:31:32.353
and they are going
to shit in your cold plunge,

01:31:32.354 --> 01:31:34.722
and they, in general,
are going to fuck your shit up.

01:31:34.723 --> 01:31:37.224
So fuck these
food delivery robots,

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:39.827
fuck this AI bullshit.

01:31:39.828 --> 01:31:41.028
Fuck all of that.

01:31:41.029 --> 01:31:42.229
And here's the good news.

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:44.165
If you don't like
any of this,

01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:45.733
I have the controlling stake
in this company,

01:31:45.734 --> 01:31:47.334
so you can get fucked.

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:49.972
One ranch, one star, bitch.

01:31:53.776 --> 01:31:55.009
Hey, Arj!

01:31:55.010 --> 01:31:56.645
