00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:38.133
Excuse me, sir, is there a commode?

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.810
Justin!

00:01:48.894 --> 00:01:51.938
Quick, honey, take my picture.
I got the pyramid in my hand.

00:02:01.114 --> 00:02:03.241
Justin, you get back here right now!

00:02:03.658 --> 00:02:04.701
No, stop!

00:02:04.784 --> 00:02:07.204
- No, no! Stop him!
- Go back! Don't climb!

00:02:11.958 --> 00:02:13.001
Wait, wait.

00:02:13.084 --> 00:02:15.128
Hold on. Easy, little boy.

00:02:16.504 --> 00:02:18.757
Okay, stop, child! Stop right there. No!

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.011
No, no, no! There he goes.

00:02:34.564 --> 00:02:35.732
Justin!

00:02:44.407 --> 00:02:46.201
I've got him! I've got him!

00:02:57.128 --> 00:02:59.589
Outrage in Egypt tonight
as it was discovered

00:02:59.673 --> 00:03:02.425
that the Great Pyramid of Giza
had been stolen

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:05.345
and replaced by a giant inflatable replica.

00:03:05.595 --> 00:03:08.598
There is panic throughout the globe
as countries and citizens

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.768
try to protect their beloved landmarks.

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.854
Law enforcement still has no leads,

00:03:14.938 --> 00:03:17.315
leaving everyone to wonder,
which of the world's villains

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:19.943
is responsible for this heinous crime?

00:03:20.235 --> 00:03:22.028
And where will he strike next?

00:04:10.952 --> 00:04:13.371
I'm having a bad, bad day

00:04:13.455 --> 00:04:16.499
It's about time that I get my way

00:04:16.583 --> 00:04:19.169
Steamrolling whatever I see

00:04:19.836 --> 00:04:22.505
Freeze ray! Freeze ray! Freeze ray!

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:24.716
I'm having a bad, bad day

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:27.844
If you take it personal, that's okay

00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:30.513
Watch, this is so fun to see

00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:33.225
Despicable me

00:04:58.291 --> 00:05:00.252
Morning, Gru!

00:05:01.711 --> 00:05:02.754
How you doing?

00:05:02.837 --> 00:05:04.839
Hello, Fred.

00:05:04.923 --> 00:05:09.970
FYI, your dog has been leaving
little bombs all over my yard,

00:05:10.053 --> 00:05:12.138
and I don't appreciate it.

00:05:12.222 --> 00:05:15.850
Sorry. You know dogs.
They go wherever they want to go.

00:05:15.934 --> 00:05:17.686
Unless they're dead.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:21.398
I'm joking!

00:05:22.524 --> 00:05:25.402
Although, it is true.
Anyway, have a good one.

00:05:26.278 --> 00:05:28.905
Okay. Yeah.

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:32.909
Steamrolling whatever I see

00:05:33.827 --> 00:05:35.245
Despicable me

00:05:35.704 --> 00:05:38.123
I'm having a bad, bad day

00:05:38.206 --> 00:05:40.834
If you take it personal, that's okay

00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:46.840
Despicable me

00:05:52.762 --> 00:05:55.390
You've got to be pulling on my leg!

00:05:59.227 --> 00:06:00.270
Hello!

00:06:01.313 --> 00:06:03.189
Cookies for sale.

00:06:05.317 --> 00:06:07.527
Go away. I'm not home.

00:06:07.944 --> 00:06:10.363
Yes, you are. I heard you.

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:14.284
No, you didn't. This

00:06:14.367 --> 00:06:16.286
is a recording.

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.622
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:23.293
Watch this. Leave a message, beep.

00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:28.882
Goodbye, recorded message.

00:06:28.965 --> 00:06:30.800
Agnes, come on.

00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:42.604
Kyle!

00:06:42.687 --> 00:06:46.650
Bad dog! No! No, no. Sit. My muffin.

00:06:46.733 --> 00:06:47.859
Gru!

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.487
Dr Nefario.

00:06:50.654 --> 00:06:52.239
I know how you must be feel�ng.

00:06:52.322 --> 00:06:55.784
I, too, have encountered
great disappointment,

00:06:56.451 --> 00:07:00.288
but in my eyes,
you will always be one of the greats.

00:07:00.956 --> 00:07:02.415
What? What happened?

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:03.917
It's all over the news!

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.002
Some fella just stole a pyramid.

00:07:06.086 --> 00:07:09.339
They're saying he makes
all other villains look

00:07:10.173 --> 00:07:11.675
lame.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:16.054
Assemble the minions!

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:48.545
Minions, assemble!

00:07:49.588 --> 00:07:51.047
Okay. Okay.

00:07:58.096 --> 00:07:59.222
Hey!

00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:49.314
Looking good, Kevin!
How is the family? Good?

00:08:49.397 --> 00:08:50.607
All right.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.693
That's my Billy boy! What up, Larry?

00:08:54.736 --> 00:08:56.780
Hello, everybody!

00:08:56.863 --> 00:08:58.740
Yeah, all right!

00:08:58.823 --> 00:09:01.159
Simmer down. Simmer down!

00:09:01.243 --> 00:09:03.119
Thank you, okay.

00:09:03.203 --> 00:09:06.122
Now, I realise that you guys probably heard

00:09:06.206 --> 00:09:08.959
about this other villain
who stole the pyramids.

00:09:09.042 --> 00:09:11.378
Apparently, it's a big deal.

00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:14.881
People are calling it
the crime of the century and stuff like that.

00:09:14.965 --> 00:09:19.135
But am I upset? No, I am not!

00:09:20.637 --> 00:09:22.055
A little,

00:09:22.138 --> 00:09:26.059
but we have had
a pretty good year ourselves,

00:09:26.142 --> 00:09:29.062
and you guys are all right in my book.

00:09:30.146 --> 00:09:31.398
No, no raises!

00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:34.651
You're not going to get any raises.

00:09:35.485 --> 00:09:37.153
What did we do?

00:09:37.237 --> 00:09:43.243
Well, we stole the Times Square JumboTron!

00:09:43.702 --> 00:09:44.953
Nice!

00:09:46.621 --> 00:09:48.665
That's how I roll.

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:52.752
Yeah, you all like watching football
on that, huh?

00:09:53.545 --> 00:09:54.963
But that's not all.

00:09:55.046 --> 00:09:58.341
We stole the Statue of Liberty,

00:10:00.051 --> 00:10:02.429
the small one from Las Vegas.

00:10:04.598 --> 00:10:08.602
And I won't even mention the Eiffel Tower!
Also Vegas.

00:10:08.685 --> 00:10:11.479
Okay, I wasn't going to tell you
about this yet,

00:10:11.563 --> 00:10:16.234
but I have been working
on something very big!

00:10:17.193 --> 00:10:21.531
Something that will blow this pyramid thing
out of the water!

00:10:22.115 --> 00:10:26.494
And thanks to the efforts
of my good friend Dr Nefario...

00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:28.330
Thank you!

00:10:28.413 --> 00:10:29.706
There he is.

00:10:29.789 --> 00:10:31.249
He's styling.

00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:35.212
Now, we have located a shrink ray

00:10:35.295 --> 00:10:39.925
in a secret lab,
and once we take this shrink ray,

00:10:40.217 --> 00:10:43.428
we will have the capability

00:10:43.511 --> 00:10:47.474
to pull off the true crime of the century.

00:10:48.225 --> 00:10:50.685
We are going to steal...

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:57.609
Wait, wait! I haven't told you what it is yet.

00:11:00.987 --> 00:11:02.030
Hey.

00:11:02.113 --> 00:11:04.241
Dave, listen up, please.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:12.290
Next, we are going to steal,

00:11:12.374 --> 00:11:14.709
pause for effect,

00:11:15.502 --> 00:11:17.671
the moon!

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.717
And once the moon is mine,

00:11:23.176 --> 00:11:27.514
the world will give me
whatever I want to get it back!

00:11:27.597 --> 00:11:32.936
And I will be the greatest villain of all time!

00:11:35.939 --> 00:11:40.151
That's what I'm talking about.

00:11:41.778 --> 00:11:42.863
Yes?

00:11:42.946 --> 00:11:46.700
Hello, Gru?
I've been crunching some numbers,

00:11:46.783 --> 00:11:49.953
and I really don't see how we can afford this.

00:11:50.036 --> 00:11:52.831
It can't be done. I'm not a miracle worker.

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.916
Hey, chillax.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.628
I'll iust get another loan from the bank.
They love me!

00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:16.021
Edith, stop it!

00:12:16.104 --> 00:12:18.189
What? I'm just walking.

00:12:30.994 --> 00:12:33.121
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.
- Hi, Miss Hattie. We're back.

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:37.500
Hello, girls!

00:12:37.584 --> 00:12:40.420
Anybody come to adopt us
while we were out?

00:12:41.338 --> 00:12:43.340
Let me think.

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.925
No!

00:12:48.136 --> 00:12:51.223
Edith! What did you put on my desk?

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.308
A mud pie.

00:12:54.059 --> 00:12:57.979
You're never gonna get adopted, Edith.
You know that, don't you?

00:12:58.063 --> 00:13:00.357
- Yeah, I know.
- Good.

00:13:00.690 --> 00:13:04.027
So, how did it go, girls?
Did we meet our quotas?

00:13:04.861 --> 00:13:06.196
Sort of.

00:13:06.279 --> 00:13:10.534
We sold 43 mini-mints, 30 choco-swirlies,
and 18 coco-nutties.

00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:14.621
Okay.

00:13:14.996 --> 00:13:18.875
Well, you say that like it's a great sale day.

00:13:18.959 --> 00:13:21.127
Look at my face!

00:13:21.211 --> 00:13:24.464
Do you still think it's a great sale day?

00:13:25.382 --> 00:13:27.384
Eighteen coco-nutties.

00:13:27.801 --> 00:13:32.472
I think we can do a little better than that,
don't you?

00:13:33.306 --> 00:13:34.349
Yeah.

00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:38.812
We wouldn't want to spend the weekend
in the Box of Shame, would we? No.

00:13:39.229 --> 00:13:40.397
- No, Miss Hattie.
- No, Miss Hattie.

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:44.192
Okay, good. Off you go.
Go clean something of mine.

00:13:46.236 --> 00:13:47.487
- Hi, Penny.
- Hi, Penny.

00:13:47.571 --> 00:13:48.738
Hi, guys.

00:13:53.702 --> 00:13:56.913
Hello, Mom. Sorry, I meant to call, but...

00:13:57.247 --> 00:14:00.542
I iust wanted to congratulate you
on stealing the pyramid.

00:14:01.585 --> 00:14:03.003
That was you, wasn't it?

00:14:03.295 --> 00:14:06.882
Or was it a villain who's actually successful?

00:14:08.008 --> 00:14:10.760
Just so you know, Mom,
I am about to do something

00:14:10.844 --> 00:14:13.597
that's very, very big, very important.

00:14:13.972 --> 00:14:16.766
When you hear about it,
you're going to be very proud.

00:14:18.268 --> 00:14:21.479
Good luck with that. Okay, I'm out of here.

00:15:29.839 --> 00:15:31.925
Gru to see Mr Perkins.

00:15:32.342 --> 00:15:34.427
Yes, please have a seat.

00:15:46.022 --> 00:15:48.400
That's one small step for man,

00:15:51.319 --> 00:15:53.029
one giant leap for mankind.

00:15:53.154 --> 00:15:55.907
Ma, someday I'm going to go to the moon.

00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:58.869
I'm afraid you're too late, Son.

00:15:59.202 --> 00:16:01.663
NASA isn't sending the monkeys any more.

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:11.464
Hey.

00:16:18.889 --> 00:16:23.059
I'm applying for a new villain loan.
Go by the name of Vector.

00:16:27.689 --> 00:16:29.190
It's a mathematical term,

00:16:29.274 --> 00:16:33.778
a quantity represented by an arrow,
with both direction and magnitude.

00:16:37.741 --> 00:16:39.784
Vector! That's me,

00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:45.123
'cause I'm committing crimes
with both direction and magnitude.

00:16:45.207 --> 00:16:46.875
Oh, yeah!

00:16:49.002 --> 00:16:50.629
Check out my new weapon.

00:16:50.712 --> 00:16:52.964
Piranha gun! Oh, yes!

00:16:53.048 --> 00:16:56.801
Fires live piranhas. Ever seen one before?
No, you haven't. I invented it.

00:16:56.885 --> 00:16:59.054
Do you want a demonstration?

00:17:00.013 --> 00:17:04.267
Shoot! So difficult, sometimes,
to get the piranha back inside of my...

00:17:04.351 --> 00:17:06.811
Mr Gru, Mr Perkins will see you now.

00:17:07.812 --> 00:17:09.022
So, all I need

00:17:09.105 --> 00:17:12.150
is money from the bank to build a rocket.

00:17:12.234 --> 00:17:15.195
- And then, the moon is ours.
- Wow!

00:17:16.071 --> 00:17:17.948
Well, very nice presentation.

00:17:18.031 --> 00:17:20.325
I'd like to see this shrink ray.

00:17:20.408 --> 00:17:24.496
Absolutely! Will do. Soon as I have it.

00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:27.541
You don't have it?

00:17:27.624 --> 00:17:31.294
And yet you have the audacity
to ask the bank for money?

00:17:32.337 --> 00:17:33.880
Apparently.

00:17:33.964 --> 00:17:38.301
Do you have any idea of the capital
that this bank has invested in you, Gru?

00:17:39.344 --> 00:17:43.974
With far too few of your sinister plots
actually turning a profit.

00:17:44.808 --> 00:17:48.645
How can I put it? Let's say this apple is you.

00:17:49.187 --> 00:17:51.690
If we don't start getting our money back...

00:17:53.525 --> 00:17:55.235
Get the picture?

00:17:56.653 --> 00:18:00.240
Look, Gru, the point is,
there are a lot of new villains out there,

00:18:00.532 --> 00:18:03.368
younger than you, hungrier than you,

00:18:03.451 --> 00:18:05.495
younger than you.

00:18:05.579 --> 00:18:07.873
Like that young fellow out there
named Vector.

00:18:07.956 --> 00:18:09.541
He just stole a pyramid!

00:18:14.087 --> 00:18:16.172
I've got it. I've got it.

00:18:17.507 --> 00:18:20.176
So, as far as getting money for the rocket...

00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.263
Get the shrink ray, then we'll talk.

00:19:53.061 --> 00:19:54.312
Suckers!

00:19:59.359 --> 00:20:00.694
Suckers!

00:20:07.617 --> 00:20:08.910
We got it!

00:20:15.959 --> 00:20:17.085
What?

00:20:17.168 --> 00:20:19.963
Hey! Hey! What! Hey!

00:20:21.673 --> 00:20:22.716
No, no, no!

00:20:26.261 --> 00:20:27.429
You!

00:20:30.348 --> 00:20:34.185
Now, maybe you'll think twice
before you freeze someone's head!

00:20:34.269 --> 00:20:36.062
So long, Gru!

00:20:37.772 --> 00:20:40.066
Quick! We can't let him get away!

00:20:47.866 --> 00:20:49.576
Up ahead! Up ahead!

00:20:50.452 --> 00:20:52.412
Fire! Fire, now!

00:21:01.046 --> 00:21:02.088
You missed me!

00:21:02.172 --> 00:21:04.216
Come to papa!

00:21:17.395 --> 00:21:18.772
Take that.

00:21:20.774 --> 00:21:22.442
How adorable.

00:21:23.693 --> 00:21:25.237
Got you in our sights!

00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.281
Like taking candy from a...

00:21:28.365 --> 00:21:29.449
What?

00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:32.452
Hey, Gru!

00:21:32.536 --> 00:21:35.664
Try this on for size!

00:21:37.123 --> 00:21:39.834
That's weird. What is going...

00:21:44.589 --> 00:21:46.800
This is claustrophobic!

00:21:48.176 --> 00:21:49.594
No, no, no!

00:21:55.433 --> 00:21:57.852
Too small! This is too small for me!

00:22:04.234 --> 00:22:05.986
I hate that guy!

00:22:12.784 --> 00:22:16.830
...and please watch over us, and bless
that we'll have a good night's sleep.

00:22:16.913 --> 00:22:20.959
And bless that while we're sleeping,
no bugs will crawl into our ears

00:22:21.042 --> 00:22:23.295
and lay eggs in our brains.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.298
Great. Thanks for that image, Edith.

00:22:26.923 --> 00:22:29.676
And please bless
that someone will adopt us soon,

00:22:29.759 --> 00:22:32.679
and that the mommy and daddy will be nice

00:22:32.762 --> 00:22:34.681
and have a pet unicorn.

00:22:35.098 --> 00:22:36.308
Amen.

00:22:36.391 --> 00:22:38.143
- Amen.
- Amen.

00:22:42.981 --> 00:22:46.318
Unicorns, I love them
Unicorns, I love them

00:22:46.401 --> 00:22:50.113
Uni, uni, unicorns
I love them

00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.825
Uni, unicorns, I could pet one

00:22:54.159 --> 00:22:56.286
If they were really real

00:22:56.369 --> 00:22:57.495
And they are

00:22:57.579 --> 00:23:00.123
So, I bought one so I could pet it

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.418
Now it loves me
Now I love it

00:24:20.203 --> 00:24:22.581
Don't you... What the...

00:24:52.444 --> 00:24:54.279
Good luck, little girls!

00:24:59.451 --> 00:25:01.661
Whoa! Cool.

00:25:02.746 --> 00:25:06.791
Hi! We're orphans
from Miss Hattie's Home for Girls.

00:25:06.875 --> 00:25:08.793
- I don't care. Beat it!
- Come on!

00:25:08.919 --> 00:25:12.172
We're selling cookies
so, you know, we can have a better future.

00:25:12.255 --> 00:25:15.091
- Wait, wait! Do you have coco-nutties?
- Yeah.

00:25:37.239 --> 00:25:39.366
Light bulb.

00:25:42.452 --> 00:25:43.787
Dr Nefario!

00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.123
I'm going to need a dozen tiny robots
disguised as cookies!

00:25:47.207 --> 00:25:49.167
- What?
- Cookie robots!

00:25:49.251 --> 00:25:51.670
- Who is this?
- Oh, forget it.

00:25:58.301 --> 00:26:01.096
Well, it appears you have cleared
our background check,

00:26:01.638 --> 00:26:03.390
Dr Gru.

00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:08.812
And I see you have made a list

00:26:08.895 --> 00:26:12.649
of some of your personal achievements.

00:26:12.983 --> 00:26:15.527
Thank you for that. I love reading.

00:26:23.326 --> 00:26:25.787
And I see you have been given
the Medal of Honor

00:26:25.871 --> 00:26:27.998
and a knighthood.

00:26:30.375 --> 00:26:31.877
- Me, me, me.
- Me, me, me.

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.211
Kevin?

00:26:34.921 --> 00:26:37.048
You had your own cooking show

00:26:37.132 --> 00:26:41.052
and you can hold your breath
for 30 seconds?

00:26:41.136 --> 00:26:42.846
It's not that impressive.

00:26:45.098 --> 00:26:46.308
Idiot!

00:26:48.351 --> 00:26:51.146
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

00:26:53.064 --> 00:26:56.067
What in the name of... What?

00:26:56.651 --> 00:26:59.863
Well, here's the dealio.

00:26:59.946 --> 00:27:04.868
Things have been so lonely since my wife,

00:27:06.745 --> 00:27:09.247
Debbie, passed on.

00:27:09.331 --> 00:27:12.417
It's like my heart is a tooth,

00:27:13.084 --> 00:27:17.964
and it's got a cavity
that can only be filled with children.

00:27:18.381 --> 00:27:19.549
I'm sorry.

00:27:23.929 --> 00:27:27.098
You are a beautiful woman.
Do you speak Spanish?

00:27:27.599 --> 00:27:30.018
Do I look like I speak Spanish?

00:27:31.895 --> 00:27:35.440
You have a face como un burro.

00:27:38.944 --> 00:27:41.446
Well, thank you!

00:27:42.948 --> 00:27:46.660
Anyway, can we proceed with this adoption?

00:27:46.743 --> 00:27:48.328
So, so excited!

00:27:50.247 --> 00:27:53.625
Please tell Margo, Edith and Agnes
to come to the lobby.

00:27:56.670 --> 00:27:58.380
I bet the mom is beautiful!

00:27:58.463 --> 00:28:00.590
I bet the daddy's eyes sparkle.

00:28:00.674 --> 00:28:03.468
I bet their house is made of Gummi Bears.

00:28:04.469 --> 00:28:06.763
I'm just saying it'd be nice.

00:28:07.847 --> 00:28:11.142
My caterpillar never turned into a butterfly.

00:28:11.226 --> 00:28:12.852
That's a Cheeto.

00:28:15.981 --> 00:28:19.484
Well, Debbie was a very lucky woman.

00:28:21.903 --> 00:28:23.321
Who's Debbie?

00:28:23.405 --> 00:28:24.823
Your wife.

00:28:25.282 --> 00:28:26.783
Hi, girls!

00:28:36.835 --> 00:28:39.629
Girls, I want you to meet Mr Gru.

00:28:41.006 --> 00:28:43.049
He's going to adopt you.

00:28:43.133 --> 00:28:45.677
And he's a dentist!

00:28:48.013 --> 00:28:49.347
Yeah!

00:28:53.101 --> 00:28:57.480
Hi. I'm Margo. This is Edith.

00:28:58.023 --> 00:28:59.858
And that's Agnes.

00:28:59.941 --> 00:29:01.902
I got your leg, I got your leg!

00:29:01.985 --> 00:29:05.071
Okay, that is enough, little girl.

00:29:05.155 --> 00:29:07.490
- Let go of my leg. Come on. You can do it.
- Higher!

00:29:07.574 --> 00:29:09.868
- Higher!
- Just release your grip. Wow!

00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:13.330
How do you remove them?
Is there a command?

00:29:13.413 --> 00:29:15.373
Some nonstick spray?

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.543
Crowbar?

00:29:20.337 --> 00:29:23.006
Okay, girls, let's go.

00:29:46.863 --> 00:29:48.281
Oh, yeah!

00:29:50.659 --> 00:29:52.661
Pretty impressive!

00:29:53.954 --> 00:29:55.914
What are you looking at?

00:29:55.997 --> 00:29:57.249
Boo-ya!

00:29:59.459 --> 00:30:01.461
You got shrunk, tiny mouthwash!

00:30:02.087 --> 00:30:03.129
Take that!

00:30:04.256 --> 00:30:06.049
You done been shrunk!

00:30:06.883 --> 00:30:08.093
Yello?

00:30:08.927 --> 00:30:10.929
I got the shrink ray, all right.

00:30:12.138 --> 00:30:14.641
No, I'm not playing with it.

00:30:14.724 --> 00:30:16.226
Gru?

00:30:18.019 --> 00:30:19.855
Don't make me laugh! No.

00:30:20.355 --> 00:30:22.899
P.S., he is not getting the moon,

00:30:22.983 --> 00:30:26.027
and P.P.S., by the time I'm done with him,

00:30:26.111 --> 00:30:27.654
he's gonna be begging for mercy.

00:30:29.739 --> 00:30:30.949
Okay, bye.

00:30:32.951 --> 00:30:37.038
Look at you, a little tiny toilet
for a little tiny baby...

00:30:38.456 --> 00:30:40.292
Curse you, tiny toilet!

00:30:44.963 --> 00:30:47.048
Okay, here we are.

00:30:47.132 --> 00:30:48.675
Home sweet home.

00:30:51.136 --> 00:30:54.055
So, this is, like, your house?

00:30:54.848 --> 00:30:56.141
Wait a sec...

00:30:56.224 --> 00:30:58.977
You're the guy
who pretended he was a recorded message!

00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.062
No, that was someone else.

00:31:14.618 --> 00:31:15.911
Can I hold your hand?

00:31:16.703 --> 00:31:17.746
No.

00:31:28.006 --> 00:31:32.886
When we got adopted by a bald guy,
I thought this'd be more like Annie.

00:31:41.811 --> 00:31:43.104
No, hey!

00:31:47.192 --> 00:31:50.362
Kyle, these are not treats. These are guests.

00:31:50.445 --> 00:31:53.073
Girls, this is Kyle, my

00:31:53.156 --> 00:31:54.199
dog.

00:31:57.035 --> 00:31:58.119
Fluffy doggy!

00:32:03.542 --> 00:32:04.709
What kind of dog is that?

00:32:04.793 --> 00:32:07.420
He is a... I don't know.

00:32:08.296 --> 00:32:11.508
Do you really think that this is
an appropriate place for little kids?

00:32:12.008 --> 00:32:13.677
'Cause it's not.

00:32:14.719 --> 00:32:17.097
No! No! Stay away from there!

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.723
It's fragile.

00:32:21.309 --> 00:32:24.771
Well, I suppose the plan will work with two.

00:32:24.855 --> 00:32:27.649
Hey! It's dark in here.

00:32:30.527 --> 00:32:32.863
It poked a hole in my juice box.

00:32:37.826 --> 00:32:39.077
As you can see,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:42.664
I have provided everything
a child might need.

00:32:44.541 --> 00:32:45.625
All right.

00:32:46.751 --> 00:32:49.129
Okay. As I was saying... Hey!

00:32:50.338 --> 00:32:51.381
Somebody broke that.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:55.510
Okay, okay.
Clearly, we need to set some rules.

00:32:55.594 --> 00:32:57.429
Rule number one.

00:32:57.512 --> 00:33:00.098
You will not touch anything.

00:33:00.181 --> 00:33:02.017
What about the floor?

00:33:02.434 --> 00:33:04.477
Yes, you may touch the floor.

00:33:04.561 --> 00:33:05.937
What about the air?

00:33:06.021 --> 00:33:08.106
Yes, you may touch the air!

00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:09.232
What about this?

00:33:12.402 --> 00:33:14.362
- Where did you get that?
- Found it.

00:33:14.446 --> 00:33:18.241
Okay. Rule number two.
You will not bother me while I'm working.

00:33:18.325 --> 00:33:20.202
Rule number three.

00:33:20.285 --> 00:33:24.748
You will not cry or whine or laugh or giggle

00:33:25.081 --> 00:33:27.459
or sneeze or burp or fart!

00:33:28.126 --> 00:33:32.464
So, no, no, no annoying sounds. All right?

00:33:32.547 --> 00:33:34.799
Does this count as annoying?

00:33:38.136 --> 00:33:39.512
Very!

00:33:41.806 --> 00:33:44.392
I will see you in six hours.

00:33:46.478 --> 00:33:50.398
Okay, don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.

00:33:51.024 --> 00:33:55.403
We're gonna be really happy here.
Right? Agnes?

00:34:23.974 --> 00:34:26.977
Question. What are these?

00:34:27.894 --> 00:34:30.939
A dozen boogie robots! Boogie!

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.484
Look at this. Watch me!

00:34:38.363 --> 00:34:41.032
Cookie robots. I said cookie robots.

00:34:41.616 --> 00:34:44.202
Why are you so old?

00:34:46.663 --> 00:34:48.373
Okay. I'm on it.

00:34:49.207 --> 00:34:50.542
Hello?

00:35:06.224 --> 00:35:07.475
TV!

00:35:27.329 --> 00:35:28.538
What is that?

00:35:28.747 --> 00:35:31.166
- Look at that!
- That is cool!

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.293
Come on!

00:35:33.793 --> 00:35:36.087
I don't think he's a dentist.

00:35:49.935 --> 00:35:51.770
We've been working on this for a while.

00:35:51.853 --> 00:35:54.606
It's a anti-gravity serum.

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:03.740
I meant to close that.
He'll be all right, I'm sure.

00:36:03.823 --> 00:36:06.868
- Do the effects wear off?
- So far

00:36:06.952 --> 00:36:08.954
no. No, they don't.

00:36:10.497 --> 00:36:13.583
And here, of course,
is the new weapon you ordered.

00:36:17.254 --> 00:36:18.296
No, no.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:22.217
I said "dart gun," not... Okay.

00:36:22.801 --> 00:36:25.554
Oh, yes. 'Cause I was wondering

00:36:25.637 --> 00:36:28.265
under what circumstances
would we use this?

00:36:28.348 --> 00:36:29.808
But, anyway.

00:36:29.891 --> 00:36:33.311
What I really wanted to show you was this.

00:36:38.066 --> 00:36:41.194
Now those are cookie robots!

00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:45.574
La, la, la, la
I love unicorns

00:36:45.657 --> 00:36:49.327
What are you doing here?
I told you to stay in the kitchen!

00:36:49.411 --> 00:36:52.080
We got bored. What is this place?

00:36:52.163 --> 00:36:53.915
Can I drink this?

00:36:53.999 --> 00:36:56.459
Do you want to explode?

00:36:58.086 --> 00:36:59.129
Gru!

00:36:59.212 --> 00:37:01.172
Get back in the kitchen!

00:37:01.256 --> 00:37:03.383
- Will you play with us?
- No.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.011
- Why?
- Because I'm busy.

00:37:06.094 --> 00:37:07.679
Doing what?

00:37:09.097 --> 00:37:10.682
Okay, okay, you got me.

00:37:10.765 --> 00:37:13.518
The dentist thing is more of a hobby.

00:37:14.102 --> 00:37:16.521
In real life, I am a spy.

00:37:17.022 --> 00:37:20.192
And it is top secret,
and you may not tell anybody,

00:37:20.275 --> 00:37:22.360
- because if you do...
- What does this do?

00:37:26.239 --> 00:37:27.365
Hey!

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:29.659
My unicorn!

00:37:29.993 --> 00:37:31.661
You have to fix it.

00:37:31.745 --> 00:37:37.042
Fix it? Look, it has been disintegrated.
By definition, it cannot be fixed.

00:37:42.339 --> 00:37:44.507
That's freaking me out. What is she doing?

00:37:44.591 --> 00:37:47.761
She's gonna hold her breath
until she gets a new one.

00:37:49.137 --> 00:37:52.515
It is just a toy. Now stop it!

00:37:54.809 --> 00:37:56.937
Okay, okay! I'll fix it!

00:37:57.354 --> 00:37:59.314
Tim! Mark! Phil!

00:38:01.983 --> 00:38:03.235
This is very important.

00:38:03.318 --> 00:38:06.821
You have to get the little girl
a new unicorn toy.

00:38:12.869 --> 00:38:14.746
Hey, hey, hey! A toy!

00:38:15.914 --> 00:38:18.041
Go, and hurry!

00:38:18.124 --> 00:38:19.292
What are those?

00:38:19.376 --> 00:38:22.546
They are my cousins.

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:24.923
Jerry! Stuart!

00:38:26.007 --> 00:38:29.010
Watch them,
and keep them away from me, please.

00:38:46.278 --> 00:38:48.655
- Wow!
- Wow!

00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.888
It was your cousin's idea.

00:39:55.222 --> 00:39:56.389
What?

00:39:56.765 --> 00:39:58.266
Okay, bedtime.

00:40:01.561 --> 00:40:03.021
Not you two!

00:40:04.564 --> 00:40:09.277
Okey-dokey. Beddie-bye.
All tucked in. Sweet dreams.

00:40:11.196 --> 00:40:13.031
Just so you know,

00:40:13.114 --> 00:40:15.075
you're never gonna be my dad.

00:40:15.659 --> 00:40:17.744
I think I can live with that.

00:40:19.412 --> 00:40:21.248
Are these beds made out of bombs?

00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:25.961
Yes, but they are very old
and highly unlikely to blow up.

00:40:26.878 --> 00:40:28.922
But try not to toss and turn.

00:40:29.005 --> 00:40:30.131
Cool.

00:40:31.091 --> 00:40:34.261
- Will you read us a bedtime story?
- No.

00:40:34.344 --> 00:40:37.430
But we can't go to sleep
without a bedtime story.

00:40:37.514 --> 00:40:41.101
Well, then it's going to be
a long night for you, isn't it?

00:40:41.935 --> 00:40:45.564
So, good night, sleep tight,
and don't let the bed bugs bite.

00:40:45.647 --> 00:40:49.526
Because there are literally
thousands of them.

00:40:50.610 --> 00:40:53.738
And there's probably
something in your closet.

00:40:55.323 --> 00:40:57.492
He's just kidding, Agnes.

00:41:19.723 --> 00:41:21.641
It's beautiful.

00:41:50.045 --> 00:41:52.505
Girls, let's go.

00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:55.425
Time to deliver the cookies!

00:41:56.384 --> 00:41:59.054
Okay. But first, we're going to dance class.

00:41:59.137 --> 00:42:02.057
Actually, we're going to have to skip
the dance class today.

00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:06.686
Actually, we can't
skip the dance class today.

00:42:06.770 --> 00:42:08.772
We have a big recital coming up.

00:42:08.855 --> 00:42:12.108
- We're doing an excerpt from Swan Lake.
- Yeah, Swan Lake!

00:42:12.192 --> 00:42:13.944
That's fantastic. Wonderful.

00:42:14.027 --> 00:42:18.114
But we're going to deliver cookies! Come on!

00:42:20.283 --> 00:42:21.326
No.

00:42:22.202 --> 00:42:23.245
No?

00:42:23.328 --> 00:42:26.540
We're not going to deliver cookies
until we do dance class.

00:42:26.623 --> 00:42:27.749
Really?

00:42:27.832 --> 00:42:31.545
Well, I am not driving you to dance class.

00:42:31.628 --> 00:42:37.008
So if you want to go,
you are going to have to walk yourselves.

00:42:43.098 --> 00:42:44.391
What are you doing?

00:42:44.474 --> 00:42:46.226
Walking to dance class.

00:42:46.309 --> 00:42:48.270
Ya? Okay, fine.

00:42:48.353 --> 00:42:52.232
You iust keep walking,
because I'm really not driving you!

00:42:52.315 --> 00:42:53.525
Okay.

00:42:54.985 --> 00:42:57.487
You're going to suffer the wrath of Gru!

00:42:57.946 --> 00:42:59.990
Seriously, I'm going to count to three!

00:43:00.073 --> 00:43:02.033
And you had better be in this car!

00:43:02.117 --> 00:43:05.745
Here we go! One! Two!

00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:09.416
...three, four and five.

00:43:09.499 --> 00:43:12.419
And lift, and stretch.

00:43:12.502 --> 00:43:15.088
And one, and two...

00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:17.299
- Here you go.
- What is it?

00:43:17.382 --> 00:43:20.927
Your ticket to the dance recital.
You are coming, right?

00:43:21.011 --> 00:43:22.679
Of course, of course.

00:43:22.762 --> 00:43:25.849
I have pins and needles that I'm sitting on.

00:43:25.932 --> 00:43:27.809
Pinkie promise?

00:43:29.019 --> 00:43:32.230
Oh, yes. My pinkie promises.

00:43:45.410 --> 00:43:50.123
All right.
Our first customer is a man named Vector.

00:43:50.207 --> 00:43:51.958
But he's a V.

00:43:52.042 --> 00:43:54.002
You know, we're supposed
to start with the A's.

00:43:54.085 --> 00:43:56.004
Then we go to the B's. Then we...

00:43:56.087 --> 00:44:01.009
Yes, yes! I went to kindergarten.
I know how the alphabet works!

00:44:03.637 --> 00:44:06.306
I was just thinking

00:44:06.389 --> 00:44:10.143
that it might be nice
to deliver Mr Vector's first.

00:44:10.227 --> 00:44:11.853
That is all.

00:44:15.106 --> 00:44:17.651
Almost over. It's almost over.

00:44:19.736 --> 00:44:23.990
Girls, welcome back
to the fortress of Vector-tude!

00:44:24.991 --> 00:44:27.494
Do you have my cookies for me?

00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:37.170
Four boxes of mini-mints, two toffee totes,

00:44:37.254 --> 00:44:41.967
two caramel clumpies
and fifteen boxes of coco-nutties.

00:44:42.050 --> 00:44:45.637
Exactly. I'd like to see somebody else
order that many cookies.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.805
Not likely.

00:44:46.888 --> 00:44:49.057
Name one person
who ordered more cookies than me.

00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.684
That'll be $52.

00:44:51.268 --> 00:44:52.561
Right.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:02.863
Seven, eight, nine...

00:45:03.738 --> 00:45:06.324
Tic Tacs! Where was I?

00:45:06.408 --> 00:45:09.619
Seven, eight, nine...

00:45:09.703 --> 00:45:11.496
Why are you wearing pyjamas?

00:45:12.497 --> 00:45:15.876
These aren't pyiamas!
This is a warm-up suit.

00:45:32.559 --> 00:45:34.895
- What are you warming up for?
- Stuff.

00:45:34.978 --> 00:45:36.021
What sort of stuff?

00:45:36.104 --> 00:45:38.523
Super-cool stuff you wouldn't understand.

00:45:38.607 --> 00:45:40.025
Like sleeping?

00:45:40.108 --> 00:45:42.986
They are not pyjamas!

00:45:54.831 --> 00:45:58.043
Here you go, 52 big ones.

00:46:16.144 --> 00:46:17.604
Bye!

00:47:11.533 --> 00:47:12.909
Come on!

00:47:35.015 --> 00:47:36.808
What the...

00:47:39.644 --> 00:47:41.313
Quiet down, fish!

00:47:48.361 --> 00:47:49.446
Down, boy!

00:48:12.510 --> 00:48:15.847
We did it! Come on, girls, let's go!

00:48:23.730 --> 00:48:26.858
But what about the other people
who ordered cookies?

00:48:26.942 --> 00:48:29.653
Life is full of disappointments

00:48:29.736 --> 00:48:31.488
for some people.

00:48:37.202 --> 00:48:38.745
Don't do that!

00:48:38.828 --> 00:48:41.831
Super Silly Fun Land! Can we go? Please?

00:48:42.249 --> 00:48:43.333
No.

00:48:43.416 --> 00:48:45.919
But we've never been.
And it's the funnest place on earth!

00:48:46.002 --> 00:48:47.045
Don't care.

00:48:47.128 --> 00:48:48.255
- Please?
- Please?

00:48:48.338 --> 00:48:49.965
We'll never ask for anything else,
ever again!

00:48:50.048 --> 00:48:52.092
- Pretty please?
- Please?

00:48:59.266 --> 00:49:01.184
- Come on!
- Come on!

00:49:01.768 --> 00:49:04.062
Light bulb.

00:49:08.817 --> 00:49:10.610
Come on!

00:49:10.694 --> 00:49:13.655
Goodbye, have fun.

00:49:17.075 --> 00:49:20.620
Sorry, dude.
They can't ride without an adult.

00:49:20.704 --> 00:49:22.122
What?

00:50:18.845 --> 00:50:20.013
Oh, my gosh!

00:50:20.096 --> 00:50:22.516
Look at that fluffy unicorn!

00:50:25.268 --> 00:50:27.562
He's so fluffy, I'm gonna die!

00:50:27.646 --> 00:50:29.105
You've gotta let us play for it!

00:50:29.189 --> 00:50:30.899
No, no, no.

00:50:30.982 --> 00:50:32.275
Come on!

00:50:33.818 --> 00:50:36.363
How much for the fluffy unicorn?

00:50:37.572 --> 00:50:39.491
Well, it is not for sale.

00:50:39.574 --> 00:50:44.538
But all you gotta do to win it
is knock down that little spaceship there.

00:50:45.413 --> 00:50:46.540
It's easy!

00:50:54.923 --> 00:50:56.216
Yay!

00:51:08.186 --> 00:51:09.396
Again!

00:51:10.105 --> 00:51:12.566
- Wait!
- Come on. One more time!

00:51:12.649 --> 00:51:13.817
Just one more.

00:51:13.900 --> 00:51:16.236
I accidentally closed my eyes.

00:51:31.585 --> 00:51:33.587
- I hit it! I hit it!
- That was cool.

00:51:38.049 --> 00:51:40.927
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What was that?

00:51:41.678 --> 00:51:44.764
She hit that. I saw that with my own eyes.

00:51:44.848 --> 00:51:47.601
Hey, buddy,
let me explain something to you.

00:51:47.684 --> 00:51:52.230
You see that little tin spaceship?
You see how it's not knocked over?

00:51:52.314 --> 00:51:55.150
Do you know what that means, professor?

00:51:55.233 --> 00:51:58.778
It means you don't get the unicorn!

00:52:00.906 --> 00:52:02.782
Somebody's got a frowny face.

00:52:02.866 --> 00:52:05.285
Boo! Better luck next time!

00:52:07.495 --> 00:52:10.207
Okay, my turn.

00:52:31.645 --> 00:52:34.147
Knocked over!

00:52:38.485 --> 00:52:41.404
- It's so fluffy!
- Yeah!

00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:44.157
That was awesome!

00:52:44.241 --> 00:52:45.867
You blew up the whole thing!

00:52:45.951 --> 00:52:48.328
Let's go. Let's try another game!

00:52:55.377 --> 00:52:57.796
Gru, do you mind if I have a quick word?

00:52:58.547 --> 00:53:00.799
Okay, girls, go play.

00:53:08.348 --> 00:53:10.642
I got the shrink ray!

00:53:13.270 --> 00:53:15.480
Cotton candy!

00:53:16.481 --> 00:53:20.443
We have 12 days
until the moon is in optimum position.

00:53:20.527 --> 00:53:22.654
We can't afford any distractions!

00:53:24.406 --> 00:53:25.657
Get me Perkins.

00:53:33.707 --> 00:53:35.834
Sorry to bother you, Mr Perkins,

00:53:35.917 --> 00:53:39.880
but I figured that you would want to see this!

00:53:40.672 --> 00:53:41.798
What?

00:53:54.311 --> 00:53:56.813
Well done, Gru. Rather impressive.

00:53:56.897 --> 00:53:59.900
Now, the rest of the plan is simple.

00:54:00.525 --> 00:54:04.279
I fly to the moon. I shrink the moon.

00:54:04.362 --> 00:54:08.074
I grab the moon. I sit on the toilet.

00:54:08.158 --> 00:54:09.784
What?

00:54:09.868 --> 00:54:11.995
Sorry. Sorry!

00:54:12.078 --> 00:54:15.207
Could you excuse me for just one second?

00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:16.708
I told you not to touch my things.

00:54:16.791 --> 00:54:19.794
I told you, I told you.
I've told you a thousand times.

00:54:19.878 --> 00:54:21.588
Hey, can we order pizza?

00:54:21.671 --> 00:54:23.590
Pizza? You just had lunch.

00:54:23.673 --> 00:54:24.841
Not now, for dinner.

00:54:24.925 --> 00:54:26.468
Dinner?

00:54:26.551 --> 00:54:29.387
Just... Fine, fine, fine, whatever.
Just get back in there!

00:54:29.471 --> 00:54:31.264
Can we get stuffed crust?

00:54:32.516 --> 00:54:33.767
- Stuffed crust!
- Stuffed crust!

00:54:33.850 --> 00:54:35.435
I'll stuff you all in the crust!

00:54:37.437 --> 00:54:38.813
You're funny!

00:54:38.897 --> 00:54:41.650
Just don't come out of that room again!

00:54:42.192 --> 00:54:43.235
All right.

00:54:44.152 --> 00:54:47.572
Sorry about that. Where were we?

00:54:47.656 --> 00:54:49.241
You were sitting on the toilet.

00:54:49.324 --> 00:54:53.870
No, no, no! No, I'm sorry.
It was a little attempt at humour.

00:54:53.954 --> 00:54:56.748
I know how much you like to laugh

00:54:59.209 --> 00:55:03.046
inside. Now, I was saying...

00:55:06.633 --> 00:55:08.593
You don't seem terribly focused, Gru.

00:55:08.677 --> 00:55:11.054
Believe me, I am completely focused.

00:55:11.137 --> 00:55:13.139
- Hello!
- What?

00:55:13.223 --> 00:55:14.391
That guy is huge!

00:55:14.474 --> 00:55:15.892
- Are we on TV?
- What are those? Children?

00:55:15.976 --> 00:55:18.770
What are you doing?
I told you to stay out of here!

00:55:23.984 --> 00:55:25.235
No, no, no!

00:55:25.318 --> 00:55:26.361
Freeze ray!

00:55:26.444 --> 00:55:28.071
Mr Gru?

00:55:32.784 --> 00:55:34.119
Okay.

00:55:35.495 --> 00:55:36.872
As I was saying...

00:55:36.955 --> 00:55:40.792
No need to continue. I've seen quite enough.

00:55:40.876 --> 00:55:43.253
- But my plan...
- Is a great plan.

00:55:43.336 --> 00:55:46.506
I love everything about your plan,
except for one thing.

00:55:47.382 --> 00:55:48.717
You.

00:55:51.970 --> 00:55:55.557
Look, Mom, I drew a picture of me
landing on the moon!

00:55:58.643 --> 00:56:02.689
Look, Mom, I made a prototype of the rocket
out of macaroni!

00:56:05.317 --> 00:56:09.696
Look, Mom, I made a real rocket
based on the macaroni prototype!

00:56:20.957 --> 00:56:22.709
I don't understand.

00:56:23.043 --> 00:56:25.337
Let's face reality, Gru.

00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:30.175
You've been at this for far too long
with Far too little success.

00:56:30.383 --> 00:56:34.596
We're gonna put our faith,
our money, into a...

00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:37.057
Well, a younger villain.

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:38.642
But I...

00:56:38.725 --> 00:56:40.810
It's over. Goodbye, Gru.

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:06.545
Now, I know there have been
some rumours going around

00:57:06.628 --> 00:57:09.923
that the bank is no longer funding us.

00:57:10.799 --> 00:57:13.593
Well, I am here to put those rumours to rest.

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.681
They are true.

00:57:19.599 --> 00:57:21.810
In terms of money,

00:57:22.978 --> 00:57:25.146
we have no money.

00:57:25.230 --> 00:57:27.816
So how will we get to the moon?

00:57:28.984 --> 00:57:30.819
The answer is clear.

00:57:30.902 --> 00:57:32.487
We won't.

00:57:35.532 --> 00:57:37.826
We are doomed.

00:57:39.077 --> 00:57:43.957
Now would probably be a good time
to look for other employment options.

00:57:45.584 --> 00:57:46.710
I know.

00:57:46.793 --> 00:57:52.007
I have fired up my resume
as I suggest that all of you do, as well.

00:57:53.008 --> 00:57:54.593
What is it?

00:57:56.511 --> 00:57:59.806
Can't you see that I am
in the middle of a pep talk?

00:58:29.461 --> 00:58:30.837
Yes!

00:58:30.921 --> 00:58:33.840
Yes, we will build our own rocket

00:58:34.466 --> 00:58:38.011
using this and whatever else we can find!

00:58:38.470 --> 00:58:42.098
Grab everything!
Hit the junkyards! Take apart the cars!

00:58:42.599 --> 00:58:44.476
Who needs the bank?

00:58:44.559 --> 00:58:46.311
Let's go. Let's go!

00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:38.572
Mom! What are you doing here?

00:59:38.655 --> 00:59:41.491
And here he is in the bathtub.

00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:43.869
Look at his little buns.

00:59:46.204 --> 00:59:47.706
Mom.

00:59:47.789 --> 00:59:49.165
Not cool.

00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:54.713
And here, he's all dressed up
in his Sunday best.

00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:57.591
He looks like a girl!

00:59:57.674 --> 01:00:00.844
Yes, he does. An ugly girl!

01:00:23.658 --> 01:00:25.243
You're funny!

01:00:38.757 --> 01:00:41.718
Yes! Mine's shaped like a dead guy!

01:00:59.819 --> 01:01:02.364
Mr Perkins, your son is here.

01:01:02.447 --> 01:01:04.282
Send him in.

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:07.118
Hey, Dad.

01:01:07.953 --> 01:01:09.412
You wanted to see me?

01:01:09.496 --> 01:01:12.457
- Yes, I did, Victor.
- I am not Victor any more.

01:01:12.541 --> 01:01:16.002
Victor was my nerd name. Now I am Vector!

01:01:16.086 --> 01:01:17.420
Sit down!

01:01:19.047 --> 01:01:21.466
Do you know where the shrink ray is?

01:01:21.883 --> 01:01:23.844
Duh! Back at my place.

01:01:23.927 --> 01:01:26.805
Oh, is that right?
Back at your place? That's cool.

01:01:26.888 --> 01:01:31.142
I guess Gru must iust have one
that looks exactly like it!

01:01:33.728 --> 01:01:36.982
What the... Those girls sold me cookies!

01:01:37.274 --> 01:01:41.027
Do you have any idea
how lucrative this moon heist could be?

01:01:41.111 --> 01:01:42.904
I give you the opportunity of a lifetime,

01:01:42.988 --> 01:01:44.823
and you just blow it!

01:01:45.699 --> 01:01:48.994
- No, I didn't.
- Oh, really?

01:01:49.411 --> 01:01:52.289
You iust wait
until Gru sees my latest weapon.

01:01:52.372 --> 01:01:55.375
Squid-launcher! Oh, yeah!

01:01:58.336 --> 01:02:00.505
There's a squid on my face!

01:02:02.048 --> 01:02:03.341
Don't worry.

01:02:03.425 --> 01:02:06.678
The moon is as good as ours.

01:02:09.514 --> 01:02:11.016
Come on now, it's bedtime.

01:02:11.099 --> 01:02:14.269
Did you brush your teeth?
Let me smell. Let me smell.

01:02:14.895 --> 01:02:16.271
You did not!

01:02:16.354 --> 01:02:20.442
Put on your PGs.
Hold still. Okay, seriously! Seriously!

01:02:20.525 --> 01:02:25.030
This is beddie-bye time, right now.
I'm not kidding around. I mean it!

01:02:25.113 --> 01:02:27.866
- But we're not tired!
- Well, I am tired.

01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:30.160
Will you read us a bedtime story?

01:02:34.039 --> 01:02:35.415
No.

01:02:35.498 --> 01:02:36.750
Pretty please!

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:40.670
The physical appearance of the "please"
makes no difference.

01:02:40.754 --> 01:02:42.839
It is still no, so go to sleep.

01:02:42.923 --> 01:02:45.050
But we can't. We're all hyper!

01:02:45.133 --> 01:02:49.638
And without a bedtime story,
we'll just keep getting up and bugging you.

01:02:49.721 --> 01:02:50.805
All night long.

01:02:52.974 --> 01:02:54.226
Fine.

01:02:55.268 --> 01:02:58.271
All right, all right. Sleepy Kittens.

01:02:58.730 --> 01:03:00.065
Sleepy Kittens?

01:03:00.482 --> 01:03:01.900
- What are these?
- Puppets.

01:03:02.359 --> 01:03:04.653
You use them when you tell the story.

01:03:11.743 --> 01:03:14.287
Okay, let's get this over with.

01:03:14.788 --> 01:03:19.042
"Three little kittens loved to play,
they had fun in the sun all day.

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:23.547
"Then their mother came out and said,
'Time for kittens to go to bed."'

01:03:23.630 --> 01:03:27.509
Wow! This is garbage.
You actually like this?

01:03:27.592 --> 01:03:29.052
Keep reading!

01:03:29.845 --> 01:03:32.222
- Come on!
- All right, all right, all right.

01:03:32.305 --> 01:03:34.891
"Three little kittens started to bawl,

01:03:34.975 --> 01:03:37.310
"'Mommy, we're not tired at all#

01:03:37.394 --> 01:03:39.938
"Their mother smiled and said with a purr,

01:03:40.021 --> 01:03:43.692
"'Fine, but at least
you should brush your fur."'

01:03:43.775 --> 01:03:45.944
Now you brush the fur.

01:03:47.654 --> 01:03:49.406
This is literature?

01:03:49.489 --> 01:03:52.742
A 2-year-old could have written this.
All right.

01:03:53.285 --> 01:03:56.288
"Three little kittens with fur all brushed

01:03:56.371 --> 01:03:59.791
"said, 'We can't sleep, we feel too rushed! '

01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:02.961
"Their mother replied, with a voice like silk,

01:04:03.044 --> 01:04:05.964
"'Fine, but at least
you should drink your milk."'

01:04:06.047 --> 01:04:08.383
Now make them drink the milk.

01:04:12.721 --> 01:04:16.600
I don't like this book.
This is going on forever.

01:04:16.683 --> 01:04:23.023
"Three little kittens, with milk all gone,
rubbed their eyes and started to yawn.

01:04:29.404 --> 01:04:35.202
"'We can't sleep, we can't even try'
Then their mother sang a lullaby.

01:04:35.285 --> 01:04:41.041
"'Good night kittens, close your eyes.
Sleep in peace until you rise.

01:04:41.625 --> 01:04:44.836
"'Though while you sleep, we are apart,

01:04:44.920 --> 01:04:49.674
"'your mommy loves you with all her heart."'

01:04:53.678 --> 01:04:56.014
The end. Okay, good night.

01:04:57.015 --> 01:04:59.267
- Wait!
- What?

01:04:59.351 --> 01:05:01.228
What about good night kisses?

01:05:03.188 --> 01:05:06.942
No, no. There will be no kissing or hugging
or kissing.

01:05:09.861 --> 01:05:12.447
He is not gonna kiss us good night, Agnes.

01:05:13.073 --> 01:05:15.116
I like him. He's nice.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.535
But scary.

01:05:17.786 --> 01:05:19.079
Like Santa!

01:05:37.597 --> 01:05:41.810
Only 48 hours till the launch,
and all systems are go.

01:05:44.062 --> 01:05:45.730
About that,

01:05:46.231 --> 01:05:50.485
I was thinking that maybe
we could move the date of the heist.

01:05:50.569 --> 01:05:56.157
Please tell me this is not as a result
of the girls' dance recital, is it?

01:05:56.241 --> 01:05:58.451
No, no, no!

01:05:58.535 --> 01:06:01.580
The recital? Don't... That's stupid!

01:06:01.705 --> 01:06:06.585
I iust think it's kind of weird
to do it on a Saturday.

01:06:06.668 --> 01:06:12.257
I was thinking,
maybe a heist is a Tuesday thing, right?

01:06:12.966 --> 01:06:16.595
Gru, you and I have been
working on this for years.

01:06:16.678 --> 01:06:18.763
It's everything we've dreamed of.

01:06:18.847 --> 01:06:20.765
Your chance to make history,

01:06:20.849 --> 01:06:24.060
become the man who stole the moon!

01:06:24.144 --> 01:06:27.939
But these girls
are becoming a major distraction!

01:06:28.023 --> 01:06:29.357
They need to go.

01:06:30.108 --> 01:06:34.112
If you don't do something about it,
then I will.

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.449
I understand.

01:06:39.951 --> 01:06:41.453
Good.

01:06:44.581 --> 01:06:45.749
Butt.

01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:50.170
Butt.

01:07:02.724 --> 01:07:03.892
Butt.

01:07:05.769 --> 01:07:09.523
All right.
Now, when we put our cups together,

01:07:09.606 --> 01:07:12.275
we will make the "clink" sound
with our mouths.

01:07:12.359 --> 01:07:13.527
Ready? Edith?

01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:14.653
- Clink.
- Clink.

01:07:14.736 --> 01:07:16.738
There we go. And now we drink.

01:07:17.489 --> 01:07:18.532
And Agnes?

01:07:18.615 --> 01:07:19.699
- Clink.
- Clink.

01:07:19.783 --> 01:07:21.159
Very good!

01:07:22.869 --> 01:07:24.246
Excuse me, girls.

01:07:24.621 --> 01:07:25.747
Come on!

01:07:25.830 --> 01:07:29.376
Don't worry, I'll be back. Keep clinking.

01:07:29.834 --> 01:07:30.961
- Clink, clink.
- Clink, clink.

01:07:33.338 --> 01:07:35.215
Miss Hattie, what are you doing here?

01:07:35.298 --> 01:07:39.219
I'm here for the girls. I received a call
that you wanted to return them.

01:07:41.805 --> 01:07:46.059
And also,
I did purchase a Spanish dictionary.

01:07:49.479 --> 01:07:50.689
I didn't like what you said.

01:07:50.772 --> 01:07:52.148
But...

01:07:58.446 --> 01:08:01.032
I will get the girls ready.

01:08:10.917 --> 01:08:13.378
Don't let her take us, Mr Gru!

01:08:14.629 --> 01:08:16.506
Tell her you wanna keep us.

01:08:16.590 --> 01:08:18.592
All right, girls. Come on, let's go.

01:08:18.675 --> 01:08:21.178
Goodbye, Mr Gru. Thanks for everything.

01:08:37.277 --> 01:08:39.362
I did it for your own good.

01:08:39.738 --> 01:08:42.824
Come on, let's go get that moon.

01:08:44.659 --> 01:08:45.744
Right.

01:10:02.320 --> 01:10:03.446
What is this for?

01:10:05.115 --> 01:10:06.408
The recital?

01:10:06.491 --> 01:10:09.744
I am the greatest criminal mind
of the century.

01:10:09.828 --> 01:10:13.915
I don't go to little girls' dance recitals!

01:10:34.728 --> 01:10:39.691
Opening launch bay doors.
Commencing launch sequence.

01:10:39.774 --> 01:10:44.779
And we are good to go
in T minus 10 seconds.

01:10:45.864 --> 01:10:50.327
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:51.453
six...

01:11:17.521 --> 01:11:18.772
Oh, yeah!

01:11:20.732 --> 01:11:23.276
Nice work, Doctor. All systems go.

01:11:23.693 --> 01:11:24.778
Boo-ya!

01:11:36.039 --> 01:11:37.624
My flight suit.

01:11:39.376 --> 01:11:42.546
Oh, yeah! Once again, the mighty...

01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.090
I've got it!

01:13:10.592 --> 01:13:13.428
I've got the moon!

01:13:13.512 --> 01:13:16.306
I've got the moon!

01:13:31.404 --> 01:13:32.906
I can make it!

01:13:40.163 --> 01:13:42.499
- Wait a minute!
- Kevin!

01:13:45.627 --> 01:13:47.212
Come on, come on!

01:13:55.470 --> 01:13:57.055
He's still not here.

01:13:57.138 --> 01:13:59.558
Why would he come? He gave us up.

01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:01.184
But he pinkie promised!

01:14:01.268 --> 01:14:04.020
Girls, girls, places!

01:14:04.104 --> 01:14:06.898
No, we can't start yet!
We're still expecting someone.

01:14:06.982 --> 01:14:09.359
Can we just wait a few more minutes?

01:14:13.196 --> 01:14:15.615
All right. But just a few more minutes.

01:14:15.699 --> 01:14:17.784
He's not coming, guys.

01:14:21.246 --> 01:14:23.248
Gru! Gru, can you hear me?

01:14:25.584 --> 01:14:29.129
Quick, we have to warn him, and fast!

01:15:04.122 --> 01:15:06.124
Okay, okay. There's the library.

01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:08.919
That's Third Street. The dance studio...

01:15:09.002 --> 01:15:10.420
There! There! There it is!

01:15:47.874 --> 01:15:50.293
Sorry, buddy. Show's over.

01:15:50.627 --> 01:15:52.254
Over?

01:16:30.208 --> 01:16:31.710
Vector, open up!

01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:35.964
First give me the moon. Then we'll talk.

01:16:49.519 --> 01:16:52.022
- Mr Gru!
- Lip it, Happy Meal.

01:16:52.105 --> 01:16:53.607
Now, the girls.

01:16:53.690 --> 01:16:58.069
Actually, I think I'll hold on to them
a little while longer.

01:16:58.153 --> 01:16:59.196
No!

01:16:59.279 --> 01:17:01.948
Oh, yeah! Unpredictable!

01:17:02.657 --> 01:17:04.159
Listen close, you little punk.

01:17:04.242 --> 01:17:07.579
When I get in there,
you are in for a world of pain!

01:17:08.872 --> 01:17:10.707
I'm really scared!

01:17:14.169 --> 01:17:16.004
He is gonna kick your butt.

01:17:56.294 --> 01:17:58.171
What? He punched my shark!

01:18:24.906 --> 01:18:26.032
There he is!

01:18:31.955 --> 01:18:33.206
Hang on, Gru.

01:18:38.545 --> 01:18:39.838
Oh, no!

01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:51.975
Vector has the girls. Go!

01:18:55.979 --> 01:18:57.647
What happened to the ship? It's big again!

01:18:57.731 --> 01:19:00.483
- Not as big as the moon is going to be!
- What?

01:19:00.567 --> 01:19:05.655
The larger the mass of an obiect, the quicker
the effects of the shrink ray wear off!

01:19:05.739 --> 01:19:08.658
I call it the Nefario Principle.

01:19:08.742 --> 01:19:10.660
I just came up with it now, actually.

01:19:11.494 --> 01:19:12.996
Oh, no!

01:19:19.044 --> 01:19:20.378
Did you see that?

01:19:20.504 --> 01:19:23.215
- Vector! Help!
- Vector!

01:19:23.298 --> 01:19:24.508
- Over here!
- Hey!

01:19:24.591 --> 01:19:26.218
What are you girls doing back there?

01:19:26.301 --> 01:19:27.344
The moon!

01:19:43.485 --> 01:19:44.528
Watch out!

01:19:48.365 --> 01:19:50.158
Get as close in as you can.

01:19:50.992 --> 01:19:52.285
You got it.

01:20:08.635 --> 01:20:10.846
- Mr Gru, up here!
- Mr Gru!

01:20:10.929 --> 01:20:12.973
Okay, girls! Girls!

01:20:13.056 --> 01:20:15.767
- You're going to have to iump.
- Jump?

01:20:15.851 --> 01:20:17.769
Are you insane?

01:20:17.853 --> 01:20:19.271
Don't worry, I will catch you.

01:20:20.188 --> 01:20:21.606
You gave us back!

01:20:21.690 --> 01:20:25.861
I know, I know.
And it is the worst mistake I ever made.

01:20:26.444 --> 01:20:28.363
But you have to jump now.

01:20:28.947 --> 01:20:31.032
It'll be okay.

01:20:35.996 --> 01:20:37.038
Okay, girls.

01:20:39.124 --> 01:20:40.625
Jump now!

01:20:45.630 --> 01:20:47.924
Margo, I will catch you.

01:20:48.592 --> 01:20:51.636
And I will never let you go again.

01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:03.273
- Not so fast!
- No!

01:21:03.356 --> 01:21:04.608
Let me go!

01:21:08.570 --> 01:21:09.654
Margo!

01:21:15.452 --> 01:21:17.662
I'm coming, Margo. Hang on!

01:21:46.608 --> 01:21:48.109
I got you.

01:22:06.253 --> 01:22:07.379
No!

01:22:24.563 --> 01:22:25.814
Oh, poop.

01:22:26.898 --> 01:22:28.733
This time, good triumphs,

01:22:28.817 --> 01:22:31.945
and the moon has been returned
to its rightful place in the sky.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:36.950
But once again, law enforcement is baffled,
leaving everyone to wonder,

01:22:37.033 --> 01:22:38.827
who is this mysterious hero?

01:22:38.910 --> 01:22:40.871
And what will he do next?

01:22:41.413 --> 01:22:43.206
Okay, girls. Time for bed.

01:22:43.290 --> 01:22:47.002
- Come on! We want a story.
- Three sleepy kittens!

01:22:47.085 --> 01:22:51.339
Oh, no! Sorry. That book was
accidentally destroyed maliciously.

01:22:52.757 --> 01:22:55.969
Tonight we are going to read a new book.

01:22:56.052 --> 01:22:58.263
This one is called

01:22:58.346 --> 01:23:02.017
One Big Unicorn by... Who wrote this?

01:23:02.809 --> 01:23:06.521
Me! I wrote it. Look, it's a puppet book!

01:23:07.314 --> 01:23:09.024
Here, watch this.

01:23:10.192 --> 01:23:12.027
That's the horn!

01:23:16.031 --> 01:23:18.116
This is gonna be the best book ever!

01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.996
Not to pat myself on the back,
but, yes, it probably will be.

01:23:23.079 --> 01:23:24.164
Here we go.

01:23:24.247 --> 01:23:27.250
"One big unicorn, strong and free

01:23:27.334 --> 01:23:30.045
"thought he was happy as he could be.

01:23:31.379 --> 01:23:34.841
"Then three little kittens came around

01:23:35.175 --> 01:23:38.929
"and turned his whole life upside down."

01:23:39.012 --> 01:23:40.764
Hey, that one looks like me!

01:23:40.847 --> 01:23:42.974
No, what are you talking about?
These are kittens!

01:23:43.058 --> 01:23:46.811
Any relation to persons living or dead
is completely coincidental.

01:23:50.357 --> 01:23:52.734
"They made him laugh.

01:23:52.817 --> 01:23:55.028
"They made him cry.

01:23:57.280 --> 01:23:59.741
"He never should have said goodbye.

01:24:00.575 --> 01:24:05.163
"And now he knows he could never part

01:24:05.247 --> 01:24:07.833
"from those three little kittens

01:24:08.333 --> 01:24:11.253
"that changed his heart.

01:24:11.336 --> 01:24:13.421
"The end."

01:24:13.505 --> 01:24:15.841
Okay, all right. Good night.

01:24:39.155 --> 01:24:40.782
I love you.

01:24:41.324 --> 01:24:43.034
I love you, too.

01:24:52.377 --> 01:24:54.212
No, no!

01:24:56.423 --> 01:24:57.549
All right.

01:25:02.554 --> 01:25:04.723
Didn't I get you already?

01:25:38.548 --> 01:25:40.550
They're very good!

01:25:40.634 --> 01:25:43.595
I'm so proud of you, Son.

01:25:43.678 --> 01:25:46.598
You've turned out to be a great parent!

01:25:47.724 --> 01:25:49.226
Just like me.

01:25:49.809 --> 01:25:52.062
Maybe even better.

01:26:19.381 --> 01:26:21.091
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

01:26:22.843 --> 01:26:24.302
No, no, no!

01:28:03.944 --> 01:28:05.529
Hey, Carl! Hey.

01:28:09.783 --> 01:28:10.867
No, no, no.

01:28:10.951 --> 01:28:12.160
Me, me, me.

01:28:13.495 --> 01:28:14.538
John?

01:28:14.621 --> 01:28:16.081
No, no. Me, me, me.

01:28:39.813 --> 01:28:40.856
Oh, poop.

01:29:27.569 --> 01:29:28.778
Oh, no!

01:29:29.613 --> 01:29:31.072
Stop! Stop!

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:33.677
Hello, I am Gru.

01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:36.763
Back to work, back to work! Back to...
