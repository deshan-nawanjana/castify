WEBVTT

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:46.546
Okay. Wind her up, boys!

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:49.382
It's Monte Carlo or bust.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:50.800
- Struts.
- Check.

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:51.926
- Flaps.
- Check.

00:00:52.094 --> 00:00:53.302
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

00:00:54.763 --> 00:00:57.890
We'll be back from our gambling
spree in a couple weeks.

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.976
- Bye!
- Or whenever the gold runs out.

00:01:00.144 --> 00:01:01.102
- Buh-bye!
- Good-bye.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.937
All right! We'll be
waiting for you!

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.107
Just kidding! We're
never coming back!

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:07.567
Sorry! What was that?

00:01:07.735 --> 00:01:09.495
Initiate warp drive.

00:01:13.407 --> 00:01:16.242
Did they just say they were
never coming back?

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:18.995
Guys?

00:01:22.583 --> 00:01:25.209
- Marty?
- Oh, goody, you're here!

00:01:25.377 --> 00:01:27.503
Why don't you just chew on this?

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.756
I'm hungry.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.718
Ow!

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:36.095
I'm just messing with you.

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.056
I lost all feeling
in this thing years ago.

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:43.352
Melman? Why do you
look like that?

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.396
Ooh, look who's talking.

00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:48.566
Gloria? Why are you
guys so... elderly?

00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.486
Now, when was the last time
you looked in the mirror?

00:01:51.653 --> 00:01:53.154
- What?
- Hmm?

00:01:53.655 --> 00:01:56.866
- No!
- Wake up! Wake up, Ally-Al!

00:01:57.034 --> 00:01:58.618
- Wake up!
- Marty!

00:01:58.786 --> 00:02:01.370
Marty, it was horrible. That
same nightmare again, huh?

00:02:01.538 --> 00:02:04.624
We were stuck here in Africa, and we were
all super-old and wrinkly...

00:02:04.792 --> 00:02:07.251
Well, I aged well, but the rest
of you looked terrible!

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:10.421
Relax, Alex. 'Cause I got
a surprise for you!

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:13.049
Is it the penguins? Have
they come to take us home?

00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:15.885
Nope. But
it's the next best thing.

00:02:16.053 --> 00:02:18.971
- Another day bites the dust.
- Come on, now!

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.890
Watch it. Watch
yourself. Small divots!

00:02:21.058 --> 00:02:24.143
Sorry, little incline
there. Back up this hill.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.353
Ow!

00:02:25.521 --> 00:02:29.315
A low-hanging branch, then just
over this bluff and voilá!

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:34.612
Happy Birthday, pal!

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.782
Whoa.

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.330
Wow! New York City.

00:02:44.832 --> 00:02:46.499
<font color="#804040">GLORIA, MELMAN</font>: Surprise!

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.961
Gloria! You're
the Statue of Liberty!

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:52.088
Bring me your huddled
masses, baby!

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:54.632
And, Melman, you're
the Brooklyn Bridge!

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.425
Actually, I'm
the Triboro Bridge.

00:02:56.593 --> 00:02:59.345
Wow! You guys made this?

00:02:59.513 --> 00:03:03.266
Yeah. From memory! From
crazy, obsessive memory.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:07.895
Hey! Fifth Avenue...
with no traffic!

00:03:08.063 --> 00:03:12.066
There's Times Square, with its
modern-day corporate lack of character.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:14.944
Nine Duane Reades
on the same street!

00:03:17.531 --> 00:03:19.365
And the zoo.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.534
Wow, our home.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:23.286
Look! There's a little me.

00:03:23.871 --> 00:03:26.038
And little all of us-es!

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:33.880
Alex! Alex! Alex!

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.148
Oh, no!

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:06.787
You guys. You've both made
and ruined my day.

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:08.956
Make a wish, sweetheart.

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:13.252
Ta-da!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.004
Your wish has come true!

00:04:15.172 --> 00:04:16.923
Oh, yay!

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.425
My tummy is speaking to me!

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.093
Oh, gross!

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:23.930
Uh... I wouldn't eat that side
of the cake if I were you.

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:26.974
Alex, what was your wish?

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:29.894
I wished we could go home.
I mean, don't get me wrong.

00:04:30.062 --> 00:04:32.605
I love this. But
it's not the real thing.

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:35.358
That's because it's a mud
model, Alex.

00:04:35.525 --> 00:04:38.110
It's not actually New York.
I hope that was clear.

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.528
What are we doing?

00:04:39.696 --> 00:04:42.531
Here we are relying on the penguins
to come back for us.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.202
But... we should just go
to Monte Carlo and get them.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.046
How do a lion, a zebra,
a giraffe and a hippo

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:51.106
walk into a casino
in Monte Carlo?

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.335
- I don't know. Ask the Rabbi!
- Hey, I'm serious.

00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:57.421
Come on! We can do it! We
can do anything! It's us!

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:58.422
We're us!

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.925
Yeah, that's right. We've gone
halfway around the world!

00:05:01.093 --> 00:05:04.929
Compared with that, Monte Carlo's just
a hop, skip and a swim away!

00:05:05.097 --> 00:05:07.056
- Yeah.
- To home.

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:08.265
- Home!
- Home.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.101
- Home.
- Cheeseburger.

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.229
Tell you what, bet those
penguins will be glad to see us.

00:05:13.397 --> 00:05:16.148
Yeah, they're probably
bored out of their minds!

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.040
You pillow fight like a bunch
of little girls!

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:34.333
Yah!

00:05:34.501 --> 00:05:39.171
Chimichanga! These pillows
are filled with baby birds!

00:06:07.868 --> 00:06:10.911
- What?
- There it is. The casino!

00:06:11.079 --> 00:06:14.165
What?

00:06:14.416 --> 00:06:16.834
I said, "Perfect. That's where
we'll find the penguins."

00:06:19.254 --> 00:06:21.714
What?

00:06:21.882 --> 00:06:23.591
Shh! Come on, guys.

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:26.135
Operation Penguin Extraction
does not include levity.

00:06:26.303 --> 00:06:28.262
We can't draw attention
to ourselves.

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:30.681
We're invisible!

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:33.100
I'm talking really,
really quiet.

- Yes!
- I like it!

to the crawlspace above the casino

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.315

Whoa! Okay, Okay. I got
you. I got you, honey.

00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.615
Now, they're not gonna let
animals on to the casino floor,

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:14.451
so expect some kind of disguise.

00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:19.206
Whoa! Look at that! That
is one ugly, mug-ugly lady!

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.500
That is roach-killing ugly!

00:08:21.668 --> 00:08:23.794
<font color="#804040">ALEX, WHISPERING</font>: That's not a lady.
That's the King of Versailles.

00:08:23.962 --> 00:08:25.754
And that's not the King
of Versailles.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:28.174
That's the chimps. And
the chimps are like smoke.

00:08:28.341 --> 00:08:31.969
And where there's smoke, there's fire.
And by fire, I mean the penguins!

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.805
- King of Versailles wins again.
- I say we let it ride.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:40.311
Then we'll pick up the hippies
and fly back to New York in style.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.687
Can we buy an Airbus A-380?

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:43.606
Solid gold, baby!

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:46.025
Sir! A solid gold plane
wouldn't be able to fly.

00:08:46.193 --> 00:08:49.153
Kowalski, we'll be rich! The rules
of physics don't apply to us.

00:08:49.321 --> 00:08:51.280
- Let it ride!
- Right-o!

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:58.120
Okay. In exactly two minutes and 17
seconds, the lemurs will cut the power.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:08:59.288
- Now?
- No.

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.331
- Okay?
- No.

00:09:00.498 --> 00:09:01.332
- Now?
- No.

00:09:01.499 --> 00:09:04.793
I drop down, grab the penguins. You
crank me up, and we are out of here.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.338
Oh! Oh! Oh! Let me drop down!
I'll grab the penguins!

00:09:07.505 --> 00:09:08.705
You don't have fingers, Marty.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.466
- Now? Do it?
- No. No!

00:09:10.634 --> 00:09:11.967
These are things a leader
has to think of.

00:09:12.135 --> 00:09:14.220
Why should you be
the leader? Why not me?

00:09:14.387 --> 00:09:15.888
'Cause I'm the phase tracker!

00:09:16.056 --> 00:09:18.515
The King is letting it ride.

00:09:18.897 --> 00:09:21.578
- How did I get phased out?
- You're part of a phase.

00:09:21.603 --> 00:09:23.562
A phase isn't something you
own, it's something you're in.

00:09:23.730 --> 00:09:24.563
That's it.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.900
Who voted you Grand
Phase Master anyway?

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:29.548
Me! I voted me! 'Cause
I'm the leader!

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.528
- Black!
- That's it, baby!

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.529
- Now?
- No!

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:35.574
The King of Versailles
wins it all!

00:09:35.742 --> 00:09:37.303
- Maybe I should be in charge.
- Melman!

00:09:37.369 --> 00:09:38.619
I am a doctor.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:39.662
- Now!
- No.

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:40.950
Why can't we all be leaders?

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:43.165
Enough! I'm gonna lead.

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:01.976
- Aha!
- What's new, pussycat?

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.435
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:07.231
- Marty, what phase are we at? Uh...
- Apologize!

00:10:07.399 --> 00:10:09.400
Right. Oh, man, we are so sorry.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:12.111
Apology accepted. Let's roll!

00:10:13.071 --> 00:10:15.281
Marty! We skipped Phase Two!
We didn't chew them out!

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:17.658
Don't look at me. I'm just
following the leader!

00:10:19.077 --> 00:10:21.412
- Now!
- I'm a bit busy right now.

00:10:21.579 --> 00:10:23.038
Just pull the switch!

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:25.332
Okay, fine.

00:10:31.673 --> 00:10:33.590

on with the lights?

00:10:48.523 --> 00:10:51.817

from Animal Control!

00:10:58.033 --> 00:10:59.491
Speak.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.786
Oui.

00:11:02.954 --> 00:11:04.288
A zebra?

00:11:04.456 --> 00:11:05.873
A hippo?

00:11:06.041 --> 00:11:07.124
A giraffe?

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:09.126
A lion?!

00:11:09.794 --> 00:11:12.963
When I was seven, I strangled
my first parrot,

00:11:13.131 --> 00:11:16.759
flushed my first goldfish,
punched my first snake.

00:11:16.926 --> 00:11:21.764
Now I have finally reached the moment
I have been preparing for my entire life.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.561
To hunt the King of the beasts!

00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:34.777
Ah!

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:43.494
- Oh, no.
- Lock down, eh?

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:44.495
What do we do?

00:11:44.662 --> 00:11:48.248
All right, everybody, stand
back. I got this one.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:54.046
Never mind.

00:11:54.214 --> 00:11:56.715
Well, you only get one chance
at a first impression.

00:12:03.848 --> 00:12:06.350
- What just happened?
- Where are we? What is this?

00:12:06.518 --> 00:12:09.144
We call it the Luxury Assault
Recreational Vehicle.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.938
The car goes vroom-vroom!

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.856
Step on it, boys!

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:53.313
Captain Dubois, I am so happy
to see you! You will not believe...

00:12:53.481 --> 00:12:57.609
Get back, you fool! Your cheap Cologne
is obscuring the animal musk!

00:12:57.777 --> 00:12:58.986
Oh, my face!

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:18.088
Poor, poor animals.

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:22.176
You should never have left
the Forest. Now you deal with me.

00:13:25.555 --> 00:13:27.181
Kowalski, signal
the chimps to meet us

00:13:27.348 --> 00:13:29.391
at the rendezvous point
with the Super Plane.

00:13:29.559 --> 00:13:31.602
Hotel Ambassador. Let's move it!

00:13:31.769 --> 00:13:33.770
Whoo-hoo!

00:13:33.938 --> 00:13:36.023
Ow! Huh?

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:40.402
Voilà. Giraffe
at twelve o'clock.

00:13:41.696 --> 00:13:42.863
Guys, we've got a tail.

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:44.615
Paparazzi!

00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:47.034
Pedal to the metal, Private.

00:13:47.202 --> 00:13:48.994
Don't take any photos, please!

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:50.245
Hi!

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.122
Here I am!

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:56.043
Don't take... any... photos.

00:13:56.586 --> 00:13:59.004
- No more pictures!
- Medic!

00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.598
- ETA to rendezvous point?
- Two minutes, 37 seconds, Sir.

00:14:09.766 --> 00:14:10.849
Man your battle stations!

00:14:11.893 --> 00:14:14.937
Hey! Wait!
Nobody's at the wheel!

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:18.815
Get back there! Negative
on the driver! There's no driver!

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:22.236
Help! Nobody's driving! Oh,
no! We're going to die!

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:24.947
Don't just sit there, fancy
pants. Grab the wheel!

00:14:25.114 --> 00:14:26.865
Are you kidding? I don't
drive. I'm a New Yorker!

00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:28.116
Move over, Miss Daisy!

00:14:28.284 --> 00:14:31.703
What are you doing? Zebras can't drive!
Only penguins and people can drive.

00:14:31.871 --> 00:14:34.957
What do all these buttons do?

00:14:35.124 --> 00:14:38.710
- Help me!
- Nice one, Stripes!

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.719
Crazy woman gaining!

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:50.180
Our Omega-3 slick
will take them down.

00:14:50.348 --> 00:14:51.974
Private, activate!

00:15:05.154 --> 00:15:06.655
She's good!

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.407
Kowalski, intel.

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.965
Sir. We have
a serious problem.

00:15:11.035 --> 00:15:12.327
Captain Chantal Dubois.

00:15:12.495 --> 00:15:15.497
Monaco Animal Control.
Perfect case record.

00:15:21.462 --> 00:15:24.631
- You're going the wrong way, Marty!
- Just call me Marty-o Andretti.

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.509
- No. You're Sucky-o Andretti!
- Stop backseat driving!

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:29.761
I'm passenger-seat driving.
Give me the wheel.

00:15:29.929 --> 00:15:31.449
It's not a wheel,
it's my baby!

00:15:31.514 --> 00:15:33.140
Your hoofs aren't meant
to be on a wheel!

00:15:33.308 --> 00:15:35.267
- Hey! Too late for you to drive!
- Don't look at me!

00:15:35.435 --> 00:15:37.355
Don't look at me when
we argue! Look at the road!

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.895
Be cool, be cool!

00:15:39.063 --> 00:15:41.523
Hi, Officer. Is there a problem?

00:15:41.691 --> 00:15:42.941
Hi.

00:15:45.278 --> 00:15:47.279
Oh! Watch out!

00:15:50.491 --> 00:15:53.452
We need more power.

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.830
Time to fire
up Kowalski's nucular reactor.

00:15:56.998 --> 00:15:59.875
- That's a nuclear reactor?
- Nucular.

00:16:00.877 --> 00:16:02.085
She's on the roof!

00:16:02.253 --> 00:16:04.880
But, Sir, it's not ready. The control
rods'll have to be calibrated.

00:16:05.048 --> 00:16:06.882
And don't even ask me
about the Uranium-238 blanket.

00:16:07.050 --> 00:16:08.216
Okay.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:17.934
Okay, Marty, we lost her!
Maybe you can slow down now.

00:16:18.102 --> 00:16:19.478
I can't! There's no brakes!

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:23.106
No brakes? Way
to commit, soldier.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.047
Let's get out of here!

00:16:47.215 --> 00:16:48.924
Go, go, go! Move! Now!

00:16:49.092 --> 00:16:53.261
Hey, where's everybody going?

00:16:55.223 --> 00:16:56.264
Oh!

00:17:01.354 --> 00:17:04.773
I'm flying!

00:17:04.941 --> 00:17:09.444
I'm flying! I'm the first
flying monkey!

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:12.489
Oh, yay!

00:17:12.657 --> 00:17:14.032
That's our ticket out of here!

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.536
Yeah, baby!

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:44.229
Everybody! On the monkey chain!

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:47.023
Deploy banana gun!

00:18:02.665 --> 00:18:06.668
Grab the little guys! Toss them
up! Let's go! Go, go, go! Go!

00:18:06.836 --> 00:18:09.588
Faster! Faster!
Faster! Come on!

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.971
Come on, Melman!

00:18:18.139 --> 00:18:20.307
- Whoo! Yeah!
- Melman!

00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:22.267
Yah!

00:18:22.435 --> 00:18:23.852
My neck!

00:18:27.982 --> 00:18:31.693
Put your backs into it!
Double banana overtime!

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.369
Serpentine! Serpentine!

00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:07.771
Hey, this lady's really
starting to freak me out.

00:19:07.939 --> 00:19:10.899
Fix it, Mort.

00:19:16.614 --> 00:19:18.031
Hold this.

00:19:18.866 --> 00:19:21.368
Alex, be careful! She's crazy!

00:19:21.536 --> 00:19:22.786
You think, Marty?!

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:27.958
Ah!

00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.841
That's right! Home free, baby!

00:19:36.008 --> 00:19:37.509
I can breathe!

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.845
Au revoir, Dubois!

00:19:42.265 --> 00:19:44.099
Well played, lion.

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:46.142
Game on.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:51.857

Kowalski, status report.

00:19:59.657 --> 00:20:02.367
So the good news is this
song is almost over.

00:20:02.535 --> 00:20:05.954
Well, that's music to my ears.
And the bad news?

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.248
The gear assembly
is badly damaged, Sir.

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:12.627
It's only a matter
of time before...

00:20:20.803 --> 00:20:24.556
Why can't we ever just
make a normal landing?

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:26.057
Oh, man!

00:20:26.225 --> 00:20:29.102
Hold on, Melman. Okay?
I'll get you down, sweetie.

00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:34.816

Skipper, what about the plane?

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:49.164
The chimps will work through the night.
No breaks, no safety restrictions.

00:20:49.332 --> 00:20:52.125
Hey, where are you going?

00:20:52.293 --> 00:20:54.252
Get back here! We
have a contract!

00:20:54.420 --> 00:20:58.089
Yes. Well, I'm afraid labor laws
are slightly more lenient in France.

00:20:58.257 --> 00:21:00.884
You see, they only have
to work two weeks a year.

00:21:01.052 --> 00:21:03.720
Well, someone else has
the Canadian work ethic!

00:21:03.888 --> 00:21:06.264
But you penguins, you can
still fix it, right? Right?

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.808
Yeah, yeah. You're
a little crackerjack, can-do team.

00:21:08.976 --> 00:21:10.769
You want me to give
it to you straight?

00:21:10.937 --> 00:21:13.063
Yes! Yes! No.

00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.481
Bend it a little?

00:21:14.649 --> 00:21:18.068
Well, the plane's totaled.
Kaput, blammo, busted!

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:20.070
Never to fly again.

00:21:20.237 --> 00:21:23.073
So that's it? That's it then,
we're never gonna get home?

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.116
No! We've got to get home!

00:21:25.534 --> 00:21:28.536
We can fix it! We'll fix it! Yeah,
guys, come on, we'll fix it!

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:31.289
You just start from the outside pieces,
and you work your way in.

00:21:31.457 --> 00:21:33.041
And, yeah, perfect!

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:36.127
Come on! Don't just stand there, guys.
Marty! Drag that thingy over here.

00:21:36.379 --> 00:21:40.423
And we'll just attach it to this
dealy-Bob over here. And...

00:21:43.886 --> 00:21:45.553
We're not going home.

00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:50.892
We're never going home.

00:21:55.564 --> 00:21:56.815
It's the fuzz!

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:04.906
What are we gonna do?
We can't hide forever!

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:07.325
And we can't just blend! You
know this ain't Africa.

00:22:07.493 --> 00:22:09.327
Oh, what's the point?

00:22:09.495 --> 00:22:12.998
Tell me one conceivable way
that extra-large animals like us

00:22:13.165 --> 00:22:17.669
are gonna be able to move through Europe
without attracting unwanted attention.

00:22:20.464 --> 00:22:23.133
Hey...

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.427
Where are you coming from?

00:22:25.594 --> 00:22:29.014
Please, you got to hide us.
Just until the heat dies down.

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:30.724
Absolute no outsiders.

00:22:30.891 --> 00:22:33.351
So wipe that Smirnoff
your face and Popov!

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:36.521
Come on, man. You gotta do
one cat a solid. Cat to cat.

00:22:36.689 --> 00:22:39.441
Do a solid here, buddy. Come on.

00:22:40.276 --> 00:22:43.570
Nyet! This train
is for circus animals only.

00:22:43.738 --> 00:22:45.155
<font color="#804040">MALE, ITALIAN ACCENT</font>: They
sound like they be in trouble.

00:22:45.322 --> 00:22:50.618
Stefano, we do not invite trouble
into our circus. I don't trust lion.

00:22:50.786 --> 00:22:53.038
Hair too big and glossy!

00:22:53.205 --> 00:22:55.125
Aw, come on, Vitaly,
you're being mean.

00:22:55.291 --> 00:22:59.294
- He not lion. He lioness...
- with a beehive.

00:22:59.462 --> 00:23:02.338
This is awkward. We can hear
everything they're saying.

00:23:04.508 --> 00:23:07.761
- It is not our problem!
- No, no! Wait, wait, wait!

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:13.016
Eh... Just give us a minute.
He's on the phone and... can't get him off!

00:23:13.184 --> 00:23:15.226
Ow! We cannot leave them there!

00:23:15.394 --> 00:23:17.479
Only circus animals
on this train!

00:23:17.646 --> 00:23:21.649
Wait, listen! We are circus
animals. You got to let us in!

00:23:23.944 --> 00:23:25.695
You are really circus?

00:23:28.074 --> 00:23:29.908
Yes. Full circus!

00:23:30.076 --> 00:23:32.660
My momma was circus.
My daddy was circus.

00:23:32.828 --> 00:23:34.496
Gia! Shut the door!

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.500
- Please.
- Over there! Over there!

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:42.295
They are circus.
Circus stick together.

00:24:12.868 --> 00:24:15.370
Wow! Circus americano!

00:24:15.538 --> 00:24:18.039
You must all be very famous!

00:24:18.624 --> 00:24:20.083
- Yeah, we...
- Absolutely.

00:24:20.251 --> 00:24:24.129
- We're relatively well known...
- But Alex is really the star.

00:24:24.296 --> 00:24:28.299
Well, I'm not... I wouldn't say
"star." More like... well, star.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:29.467
What is your act, Alice?

00:24:29.635 --> 00:24:33.304
Well... I basically, uh,
I jump up on my rock...

00:24:33.472 --> 00:24:35.932
Rock? Yeah. It's a very
high... rock.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:37.934
- A really high rock!
- And then?

00:24:38.102 --> 00:24:42.730
And then, well, I roar like...
like a serious "Rawrrr!"

00:24:42.898 --> 00:24:45.316
- And then?
- And then I jump off the rock.

00:24:45.484 --> 00:24:47.861
- And then?!
- And then... And then what?

00:24:48.028 --> 00:24:49.279
- That is all?
- Into a pool!

00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:51.322
- Full of water!
- Full of cobras!

00:24:51.490 --> 00:24:53.158
Actually, it appears like I'm
jumping in to a pool...

00:24:53.325 --> 00:24:55.160
- With cobras!
- Aquatic cobras.

00:24:55.327 --> 00:24:57.447
For effect. But I actually
pull up at the last second.

00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:58.454
- Pull up?
- Yeah.

00:24:58.622 --> 00:25:00.373
- How do you do that?!
- Wire harness!

00:25:00.541 --> 00:25:01.708
- Balloons!
- Jet pack!

00:25:05.671 --> 00:25:08.882
I flip off the wire harness,
ignite my jet pack,

00:25:09.049 --> 00:25:11.676
and then toss balloons
to the children of the world.

00:25:11.844 --> 00:25:13.303
Kids love it. Kids
always love that.

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:16.514
Is this like the trapeze?

00:25:16.682 --> 00:25:18.850
Yes! Trapeze! Exactly!

00:25:19.018 --> 00:25:21.853
Wow! Trapeze americano!

00:25:22.021 --> 00:25:26.149
Hey, I have a great idea! Maybe
you come with us to Roma!

00:25:27.484 --> 00:25:30.486
Hey, Vitaly is just playing
around. He is good, no?

Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

00:25:32.114 --> 00:25:34.914
But we're gonna get off at the next stop
so we can get back to America.

00:25:34.992 --> 00:25:37.660
That is such a coincidence!

00:25:37.828 --> 00:25:40.288

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:48.713
- Sí.
- Wow? When?

00:25:48.964 --> 00:25:50.924
After Roma, we go to London.

00:25:51.091 --> 00:25:55.970
And then a big-time promoter will see
us and then send us to New York.

00:25:56.138 --> 00:25:59.557
They're going to New York! Well,
only if he likes what he sees.

00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:02.435
New York? Seriously? That's our home.
That's where we live.

00:26:03.646 --> 00:26:06.648

- Sure! - You can bunk with Vitaly!

- Or not.

00:26:11.237 --> 00:26:14.572

- Oh, no.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.369

that idea. What's he gonna do?

00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:10.783
There's nothing but bedsprings
and mattress stuffing down here!

00:40:11.701 --> 00:40:14.787
Was that the sound
of a cell door closing?

00:40:23.797 --> 00:40:24.922
Voilà!

00:40:27.509 --> 00:40:30.803
Was that the sound
of my HP printer printing?

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:41.814
This is a disaster!

00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:43.941
We blow all our money
on a bad circus,

00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:47.736
- and we're not any closer to New York!
- If anything, we're further away!

00:40:47.904 --> 00:40:51.073
We could have at least bought
a circus that knew how to circ!

00:40:51.241 --> 00:40:54.660
I don't even know why we bought
a circus in the first place.

00:40:54.828 --> 00:40:56.787
We had enough dough for a plane!

00:40:56.955 --> 00:40:59.456
Are you kidding me? You must
have some money left over.

00:40:59.624 --> 00:41:02.835
I used it to buy teeth and then
have them capped in gold.

00:41:03.002 --> 00:41:05.170
Now I can eat apples!

00:41:05.338 --> 00:41:08.966
Sadly, I discovered
I don't like apples.

00:41:09.134 --> 00:41:13.428
No promoter is sending this
show to America. It's toe up!

00:41:13.596 --> 00:41:16.473
Now it makes sense. No wonder
the circus master was so happy to sell.

00:41:16.641 --> 00:41:17.933
Shh!

00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:20.936
He was happy, all right.
Happy about ripping us off!

00:41:25.525 --> 00:41:27.609
- Where did Alex go?
- I don't know.

00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:39.705
Come on! This way!

00:41:39.873 --> 00:41:42.207
No, no, no. You come this way!

00:41:42.375 --> 00:41:44.418
Alice, watch your head!

00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:48.338
Yah!

00:41:57.765 --> 00:41:59.224
Alice!

00:42:06.316 --> 00:42:08.483
Alice!

00:42:08.651 --> 00:42:10.402
I'm fine!

00:42:10.570 --> 00:42:11.653
Fantastic!

00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.783
Was that trapeze americano?

00:42:16.951 --> 00:42:18.994
- Uh, yeah. Sort of.
- Incredible!

00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:22.164
- I hope this is important.
- Come this way, Alice!

00:42:23.666 --> 00:42:27.085
By the way, it's "icks" not "iss."
Alex. Like New York Knicks.

00:42:27.253 --> 00:42:31.465
I know. New York
Kniss. Is not hard.

00:42:31.633 --> 00:42:33.217
Whoa.

00:42:42.936 --> 00:42:44.519
What is this place?

00:42:44.687 --> 00:42:47.397
I know you think
we are a stinky, poopy circus,

00:42:47.565 --> 00:42:51.276
but there is something
you must know.

00:42:51.444 --> 00:42:54.821
There was a time when
Circus Zaragoza,

00:42:54.989 --> 00:42:56.615
we were a great circus!

00:42:56.783 --> 00:42:59.284
Numero uno in all the Europa!

00:42:59.619 --> 00:43:04.122
And Vitaly... he was the biggest
star of us all.

00:43:04.290 --> 00:43:08.293
He was fearless. Taking
risks. Always new.

00:43:08.461 --> 00:43:11.546
He jump through the hoop
like he could fly!

00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:25.852
Stefano!

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:27.938
Make the hoop smaller.

00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:30.565
- Like this?
- Smaller.

00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:32.985
- Like this?
- Good!

00:43:47.166 --> 00:43:52.170
It had never been done before because it
was physically impossible!

00:43:53.006 --> 00:43:56.049
And the people... they loved it!

00:43:56.217 --> 00:43:57.551
Viva Vitaly!

00:43:57.719 --> 00:43:58.969
Smaller!

00:44:05.518 --> 00:44:06.518
Ha!

00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.858
And the hoop, she got smaller!

00:44:13.026 --> 00:44:14.067
Like the ring

00:44:14.235 --> 00:44:18.780
on a finger of the tiniest lady
with the slimmest of fingers.

00:44:18.948 --> 00:44:20.657
Bravo, Vitaly!

00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:25.704
He would not stop pushing.

00:44:25.872 --> 00:44:28.123
And one fateful day...

00:44:28.875 --> 00:44:30.792
he push too far!

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:33.795
Light the hoop on fire!

00:44:54.567 --> 00:44:59.071
He fly too close to the sun...
and he got burned.

00:44:59.238 --> 00:45:04.409
Literally. The extra virgin
Olive oil is extra flammable.

00:45:04.577 --> 00:45:06.411
And he lost everything.

00:45:06.579 --> 00:45:09.790
His wife, she run
off with a musician.

00:45:09.957 --> 00:45:13.335
He lost his dignity...
his fame...

00:45:13.503 --> 00:45:17.089
his passion... and his fur.

00:45:17.256 --> 00:45:22.094
And when it grow back, it is less
soft. More like a prickly beard.

00:45:22.762 --> 00:45:24.262
Scusi. Vitaly!

00:45:24.430 --> 00:45:26.932
Nothing!

00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.936
His only passion now
is the borscht.

00:45:33.272 --> 00:45:36.650
- Whoa.
- He was our inspiration.

00:45:36.818 --> 00:45:38.527
So when he lost his passion,

00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:41.780
well... as Vitaly goes,
so goes the circus.

00:45:42.448 --> 00:45:45.450
This is why we need
your help. What sort of help?

00:45:45.618 --> 00:45:49.579
You can teach us to do new
circus. Americano style!

00:45:49.747 --> 00:45:51.039
We find a new passion.

00:45:51.207 --> 00:45:56.128
Make a new show. And we go
all the way to US and A!

00:46:00.675 --> 00:46:01.675
A!

00:46:04.137 --> 00:46:07.764
I know. It is stupido idea.

00:46:07.932 --> 00:46:09.808
We are a lost 'cause.

00:46:11.978 --> 00:46:14.688
No, no, this isn't
stupido. This could work!

00:46:15.773 --> 00:46:17.566
- What?
- What you just said.

00:46:17.733 --> 00:46:20.777
- What?
- The idea you said. Two seconds ago.

00:46:20.945 --> 00:46:22.904
- What?
- Your stupido idea!

00:46:23.072 --> 00:46:25.949
- It could?
- Stefano, you're a genius!

00:46:26.117 --> 00:46:29.244
No, no, no, no. I am
only average intelligence.

00:46:29.412 --> 00:46:32.956
Some say I'm
even slightly below.

00:46:33.124 --> 00:46:36.543
We are gonna rethink everything
anybody's ever known about circus!

00:46:36.711 --> 00:46:41.214
I call it Phase 4-7B, wherein,
in order to get home,

00:46:41.382 --> 00:46:45.510
we will come up with something fresh,
something amazing, something brand-new!

00:46:45.678 --> 00:46:48.930
Fresh, never before seen!
Off the chain!

00:46:49.098 --> 00:46:51.808
Something that'll blow
that circus promoter away!

00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:54.561
I missed.

00:46:54.729 --> 00:46:57.606
- Off with your head!
- I'm gonna chew his leg off!

00:46:57.773 --> 00:47:00.192
Circus has been same
for generations!

00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:02.360
We make good, classic
family entertainment.

00:47:02.528 --> 00:47:05.197
Aha! But last few generations,

00:47:05.364 --> 00:47:08.533
families... not so entertained.

00:47:11.370 --> 00:47:13.705
That's right. Families
not so entertained

00:47:13.873 --> 00:47:16.416
because you're just going
through the motions out there.

00:47:16.584 --> 00:47:18.502
It's missing passion.

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:22.297
How one to have passion
for stool poked in face?

00:47:22.465 --> 00:47:26.092
Exactly! And by stool
you mean chair, right?

00:47:27.053 --> 00:47:29.221
The fact is, you guys,
you got stuck in a rut.

00:47:29.388 --> 00:47:32.182
You stopped pushing, you
stopped taking risks.

00:47:32.350 --> 00:47:33.934
But those days are over.

00:47:34.101 --> 00:47:37.145
Because now we're going
to completely change the show.

00:47:37.313 --> 00:47:39.940
Then it wouldn't be
a circus, would it?

00:47:40.107 --> 00:47:42.943
Circus is not
about the acts you do.

00:47:43.110 --> 00:47:45.654
Circus is in here.

00:47:45.821 --> 00:47:48.073
How come Freddie
gets all the circus?

00:47:48.241 --> 00:47:52.827
Circus is about following your passions,
wherever they take you!

00:47:52.995 --> 00:47:57.207
You cannot change circus.
There is long tradition!

00:47:57.375 --> 00:48:01.545
That's what everybody thought, Vitaly,
until those French Canadians came along,

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:04.756
drunk off their Maple syrup
and cheap pharmaceuticals,

00:48:04.924 --> 00:48:07.092
and completely flipped
the paradigm.

00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:12.430
Now they play Vegas. Fifty shows
a day in 52 separate venues.

00:48:12.598 --> 00:48:14.683
And one of them
completely in the nude.

00:48:14.850 --> 00:48:16.770
Yeah, that's right. And
you know how they did it?

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:18.853
Take off their clothes?

00:48:20.273 --> 00:48:22.691
- No. They got rid of the animals.
- What?

00:48:22.858 --> 00:48:25.193
- Say it ain't so!
- Che stupida! No animals...

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.405
How could they?! Well, you
know what I say to that!

00:48:28.573 --> 00:48:30.824
I say they can take the animals
out of the circus,

00:48:30.992 --> 00:48:36.830
but they cannot take
the animals out of the circus!

00:48:38.791 --> 00:48:41.084
I mean, they cannot...

00:48:41.252 --> 00:48:43.461
I think you understand
what I'm saying!

00:48:43.629 --> 00:48:45.380
- Yeah!
- Yes!

00:48:45.548 --> 00:48:46.548
Uh... No!

00:48:46.716 --> 00:48:49.968
We don't need humans
because we've got passion.

00:48:50.136 --> 00:48:51.845
What does a human say
when he's passionate?

00:48:52.013 --> 00:48:54.306
He says, "I'm an animal!"
Well, we are animals!

00:48:56.642 --> 00:48:59.352
We'll make an all-animal circus!

00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:02.772
Because if we follow
our passion, we can go anywhere.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.066
- Anywhere!
- We can do anything!

00:49:05.234 --> 00:49:07.902
- Anything!
- If we do it together!

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:11.740
- All of us!
- Yeah... Yeah, yeah!

00:49:11.991 --> 00:49:14.659
- Our circus!
- Yeah!

00:49:14.827 --> 00:49:17.662
- We're in! We'll have some of that!
- Can I hear you say "fur power"?

00:49:17.830 --> 00:49:19.414
Fur power!

00:49:19.582 --> 00:49:22.208
Take our circus back,
and we'll do it together!

00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:24.919
You and me, baby!
An act together!

00:49:25.087 --> 00:49:25.920
I love it!

00:49:26.088 --> 00:49:28.214
We can do that funk
and groove dance thing!

00:49:28.382 --> 00:49:30.425
- Uh, dance?
- This thing right here. Look.

00:49:30.593 --> 00:49:33.511
Me and you! We got this!

00:49:33.679 --> 00:49:35.805
But I can't dance.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:39.768
- Fur power!
- Chanting is fun! Chanting is fun!

00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:44.939
Ah! I do not trust this lion.

00:49:45.107 --> 00:49:47.609
Vitaly, I may not
trust him, either,

00:49:47.777 --> 00:49:51.946
but I am tired of sitting
and standing and rolling over.

00:49:52.114 --> 00:49:55.825
It is great tradition of sitting,
standing, rolling over.

00:49:55.993 --> 00:49:58.286
You know our circus
is in trouble.

00:49:58.454 --> 00:50:03.708
This could be our last chance. But
we will not do this without you.

00:50:03.876 --> 00:50:06.836
Circus always stay together.

00:50:13.052 --> 00:50:16.971
Okay. I do one hoop.

00:50:19.225 --> 00:50:20.892
I want a hug, too!

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:23.311
Oh!

00:50:39.412 --> 00:50:44.249
Attention! I have found our lion!
He is hiding with the circus!

00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:06.539
Come on, Maurice, give it to me!

00:52:06.707 --> 00:52:09.542
More boomstick, Rico!
I really want to fly!

00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:12.378
Are you really going to shoot
yourself out of that thing?

00:52:13.088 --> 00:52:17.425
I've always dreamed of doing this,
from time I was a little pup,

00:52:17.593 --> 00:52:19.928
to be a human cannonball!

00:52:20.095 --> 00:52:23.765
Except, you know...
a sea lion cannonball.

00:52:23.933 --> 00:52:25.099
Is it dangerous?

00:52:25.351 --> 00:52:28.853
Is it dangerous? Yes,
of course it's dangerous!

00:52:29.188 --> 00:52:31.564
- Now, are you sure about this?
- I'm sure.

00:52:31.732 --> 00:52:34.609
'Cause if blowing up is your thing,
then you in the right place.

00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:36.694
Sí. That's means yes!

00:52:36.862 --> 00:52:38.154
Ready for launch?

00:52:38.322 --> 00:52:40.073
Ready for launch!

00:52:42.034 --> 00:52:43.910
Fire in the hole!

00:52:45.663 --> 00:52:46.663
Wait!

00:52:58.843 --> 00:53:00.635
Mamma Mia!

00:53:00.803 --> 00:53:02.178
Help me!

00:53:03.556 --> 00:53:06.182
Rico! Get the Cannon
ready! Same charge!

00:53:08.269 --> 00:53:10.228
- Fire in the hole!
- Oh!

00:53:19.822 --> 00:53:23.616
Oh, oh!

00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:27.412
All right!

00:53:29.373 --> 00:53:31.624
Oh! Whoo!

00:53:39.300 --> 00:53:40.675
Yeah!

00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:48.641
Marty! I'm so glad you're here.

00:53:48.809 --> 00:53:52.478
Whoo! I was flying!
I was effin-I-Y-in'!

00:53:52.646 --> 00:53:54.480
I'm proud of you, but...

00:53:54.648 --> 00:53:57.358
I don't think I can
hold on much longer!

00:53:57.526 --> 00:54:00.403
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry
about my enthusiasm.

00:54:01.322 --> 00:54:02.989
Here, wrap this around you.

00:54:08.495 --> 00:54:10.496
All right, I got you! I got you!

00:54:19.757 --> 00:54:23.176
Forget about being part of the herd!
I'm gonna be part of the flock!

00:54:23.344 --> 00:54:27.847
- I'm going to fly, baby!
- Oh, yes! What a triumph!

00:54:28.766 --> 00:54:31.366
Hand over that circus, Freddie!
I'll have your guts for garters!

00:54:31.393 --> 00:54:33.102
Hey, hey, put your weapons down.

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.189
Guys, chill out. Cute
and cuddly's obviously not your thing.

00:54:36.357 --> 00:54:37.649
He's got us pegged.

00:54:37.816 --> 00:54:39.567
I got a better idea.
Show 'em, Rico.

00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:45.823
Oh, that was great!

00:54:47.910 --> 00:54:49.786
- Flippin' 'eck!
- Rocket shoes!

00:54:49.954 --> 00:54:52.956
- I want to try that!
- Jonesy! Jonesy!

00:54:53.123 --> 00:54:54.999
Whoo! Hey. Hi.

00:54:55.167 --> 00:54:57.377
I admire how you have
inspired these animals.

00:54:57.544 --> 00:54:58.461
Oh, thanks.

00:54:58.629 --> 00:55:01.839
And what you said about passion,
it was like poetry.

00:55:02.007 --> 00:55:03.841
I love passion and poetry.
They go together, really.

00:55:04.009 --> 00:55:06.761
- I know they don't rhyme.
- Trapeze is my passion!

00:55:06.929 --> 00:55:08.429
Terrific. I look forward
to seeing you up there.

00:55:08.597 --> 00:55:10.056
You can teach me!

00:55:10.224 --> 00:55:11.516
- What?
- Teach me.

00:55:11.684 --> 00:55:13.434
Well, I've always
been kind of a solo act.

00:55:13.602 --> 00:55:15.186
So that kind of rules that out.

00:55:15.354 --> 00:55:18.272
I wonder if you
actually do trapeze.

00:55:18.440 --> 00:55:21.359
- Oh, I actually do do trapeze.
- Show me!

00:55:21.527 --> 00:55:23.695
"Show me"? What are we, five?

00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:25.613
I am five, yes.

00:55:27.866 --> 00:55:29.467
Dancing.

00:55:29.535 --> 00:55:32.245
All you're doing is moving
and not getting anywhere.

00:55:32.413 --> 00:55:34.956
I mean, the music totally
throws off my timing.

00:55:35.124 --> 00:55:36.833
You want excitement? Ha-ha!

00:55:37.001 --> 00:55:39.460
Check it out.
Who's on a tightrope, huh? Huh?

00:55:39.628 --> 00:55:40.628
Who's on a...

00:55:42.798 --> 00:55:45.383
I'm on a tightrope!
I'm on a tightrope!

00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:46.843
Melman! Oh, my gosh!

00:55:47.011 --> 00:55:48.636
- Help me!
- Baby, hold on. Hold on.

00:55:48.804 --> 00:55:51.472
- I'm coming right now!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:55:54.268 --> 00:55:56.728
Melman?!

00:55:56.895 --> 00:55:58.980
Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:55:59.148 --> 00:56:00.314
Calm down, Melman.

00:56:00.482 --> 00:56:02.650
I'm going to fall and break
all of my neck! Ah!

00:56:02.818 --> 00:56:05.403
Just look at me. Look at me.

00:56:05.571 --> 00:56:07.572
- All eyes on me.
- Okay.

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:09.657
- Come to me.
- I can't.

00:56:09.825 --> 00:56:13.745
It's just like dancing, Melman.
Two steps forward, one step back.

00:56:13.912 --> 00:56:17.331
I can't dance, Okay?
There, I said it.

00:56:17.499 --> 00:56:19.042
Maybe because you've never
tried.

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:21.335
No, I have tried.

00:56:21.503 --> 00:56:24.547
I practiced in private
because you dance so well.

00:56:24.715 --> 00:56:27.341
You practiced? For me?

00:56:27.509 --> 00:56:29.302
Yes, but it's no use.

00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:31.054
I never know what to do
with my arms.

00:56:31.221 --> 00:56:34.223
Hold it.

00:56:34.391 --> 00:56:36.893
That part is so
easy, Melman. Okay?

00:56:37.061 --> 00:56:40.021
'Cause all you have to do is put
them around your partner.

00:56:40.606 --> 00:56:43.357
See? Two steps forward.

00:56:43.525 --> 00:56:45.193
One step back.

00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:48.029
- I'm dancing. I'm dancing!
- Two steps forward...

00:56:48.197 --> 00:56:50.990
- We're dancing on a tightrope!
- You're great.

00:56:51.158 --> 00:56:53.618
Whoo-hoo! I'm dancing!

00:56:55.788 --> 00:56:59.874
Okay. Whoo! All right.

00:57:00.042 --> 00:57:03.127
So when do we get the jet
packs and aquatic cobras?

00:57:03.295 --> 00:57:06.255
Uh, this is a beginners' class,
and that's a pretty advanced maneuver.

00:57:06.423 --> 00:57:07.590
Okay, how do we begin?

00:57:07.758 --> 00:57:09.926
It's a bit complicated
unless you understand

00:57:10.094 --> 00:57:13.471
the whole pitch and yaw...
arc and gravity.

00:57:13.639 --> 00:57:17.725
All that stuff, which I won't
bore you with. Okay.

00:57:17.893 --> 00:57:19.602
- Do you need a push?
- No.

00:57:20.562 --> 00:57:21.979
Just watch and learn!

Yes! Trapeze americano.
We use the net.

Trapeze americano!

even do two hoops, no?

¿Qué? ¿Qué Grande problema?

00:58:59.953 --> 00:59:01.120
Oh, no! She's onto us!

00:59:01.288 --> 00:59:03.748
Shh! Don't make it
any easier on the psycho.

00:59:03.916 --> 00:59:06.626
- What are we gonna do?
- We'd better vamoose... pronto.

But we're not ready. We're
in the middle of rehearsals.

00:59:09.087 --> 00:59:10.379
Then why don't you lilt over,

00:59:10.547 --> 00:59:13.674
grab your peduncle,
and kiss New York good-bye?

00:59:14.301 --> 00:59:15.927
Are you sure we are ready?

00:59:16.094 --> 00:59:18.763
Of course we're ready! Born ready!
Ready steady! Come on, let's go!

All right, you heard the cat.
Move it! Come on! All aboard!

00:59:24.269 --> 00:59:26.229
Grab your luggage
and drain your bladders.

00:59:26.396 --> 00:59:28.439
It's going to be a long ride!

00:59:28.607 --> 00:59:30.316
Whoa!

00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.866
All right, everybody,
let's blow that promoter away!

00:59:39.034 --> 00:59:43.287
- London, here we come!
- Sunshiny London, yes!

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:07.311
Vitaly! Vitaly! Vitaly!

01:00:34.548 --> 01:00:37.383
Come on, come on,
come on. Where is he?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:40.052
Bingo!

01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:43.806
If that's not a red-blooded American
promoter, I don't know what is.

01:00:43.924 --> 01:00:45.725
We need to get this show
on the road. Private!

01:00:45.726 --> 01:00:47.476
Tell them the eagle has landed.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:48.978
The eagle has landed!

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:51.647
Roger that. Oh, and keep
an eye out for Dubois.

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:52.648
Aye, aye, guvnor!

01:00:52.816 --> 01:00:54.233
The promoter is in the house!

01:00:54.401 --> 01:00:57.111
New York is closer than ever!
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

01:00:57.279 --> 01:00:59.488
First, we got a circus
to do. We're on, folks!

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.074
Do we go
on before or after the dogs? Yes.

01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:03.993
- What?
- Overlap, your acts overlap.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.746
- Where's Vitaly? He opens.
- I don't know.

01:01:06.913 --> 01:01:10.541
Stefano! Hey, Stefano!
Have you seen Vitaly?

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.710
Hey.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.422
Stefano, why the sad
little face?

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:19.300
Vitaly... he will not go on!

01:01:19.468 --> 01:01:22.386
- What?
- I tried everything I could.

01:01:22.554 --> 01:01:24.430
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:27.099
Wipe away the tears. Calm down.

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:30.686
Where is he? I'm sure
I can reason with him.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:35.941
- Vitaly, what are you doing?
- You missed.

01:01:36.109 --> 01:01:39.236
You're leaving? You're just
gonna walk out on everybody?

01:01:39.404 --> 01:01:41.113
They have good show without me.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:44.450
Look, I got a good left foot,
but without my right foot, I can't walk.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.118
You get fake foot,
then you walk.

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:48.704
I don't want fake foot! Okay?

01:01:48.823 --> 01:01:50.624
What happened to "circus
stick together," huh?

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:52.375
"The show must go on."

01:01:52.542 --> 01:01:53.876
Clichés.

01:01:54.127 --> 01:01:57.213
Come on, man. Stop being
this guy! Be the other guy!

01:01:57.381 --> 01:01:58.547
What other guy?

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.759
The guy who was all circus! The
guy who jumped through hoops!

01:02:01.927 --> 01:02:04.428
Give me that! The guy
everybody looked up to.

01:02:07.891 --> 01:02:10.643
Come on. Where's that Vitaly?

01:02:11.728 --> 01:02:14.980
That Vitaly is no more.

01:02:15.649 --> 01:02:18.818
Listen, man. You may have
given up on yourself,

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.404
but your friends haven't
given up on you.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:24.132
Are you just going to turn
your back on them,

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:26.742
and sit and eat borscht
the rest of your life?

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:31.455
Or are you gonna get out there and jump
through that tiny little hoop?

01:02:32.040 --> 01:02:35.376
It is impossible.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:42.466
It was always impossible, Vitaly.
That's why the people loved it.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:49.014
That is why I loved it.

01:02:49.850 --> 01:02:53.519
Because I did the impossible!

01:02:54.354 --> 01:02:57.189
I was once a brave tiger.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:01.360
And if I go down in flames...

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:02.778
So be it!

01:03:03.363 --> 01:03:07.575
You know, I think I might
have an idea for you.

01:03:19.004 --> 01:03:22.047
Light the hoop on fire!

for? We got a show to put on.

And then we will both flip,

Flipping and catching,
and I will flip you...

No, not really.

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:44.030
Monsieur, we both know the lion
does not belong to you.

He is a fugitive from justice.

01:07:48.857 --> 01:07:50.524
You will turn
the lion over to me

01:07:50.692 --> 01:07:53.277
so that I may put him
where he belongs.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:57.823

Wait!

- Did I do good?

01:08:23.224 --> 01:08:24.767
Nah, not really.

01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:27.311
Man, that was close!

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:31.315
You are from a zoo?

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:39.531
Yes. Yes. But wait,
there's more.

01:08:39.699 --> 01:08:41.366
- More?
- Or less. There's less.

01:08:41.534 --> 01:08:43.494
You were never circus?

01:08:43.661 --> 01:08:45.579
We had to say we were circus.

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.372
Or you'd never have
let us on the train!

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:51.001
After all we have
been through together...

01:08:51.169 --> 01:08:53.670
you want to go live in a zoo?

01:08:53.838 --> 01:08:55.714
- Gia, I...
- You used us.

01:08:55.882 --> 01:08:57.257
No, no, no. I mean, yes, but...

01:08:57.425 --> 01:08:59.802
Trapeze americano, you
make that up, too?

01:08:59.969 --> 01:09:02.429
It didn't exactly exist
when I taught it to you.

01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:06.934
Jet packs and aquatic cobras!
I should have known.

01:09:07.101 --> 01:09:11.188
Balloons to the children
of the world was not real, either?

01:09:11.356 --> 01:09:13.482
Yeah, that's not real.
But look at what we did.

01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:17.694
I was shot out of a Cannon!
I could have died!

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:20.364
But I thought it
was your lifelong dream.

01:09:20.532 --> 01:09:25.285
For all I know, your name
is not even Alice.

01:09:26.204 --> 01:09:29.248
No, Stefano, but it
never really was.

01:09:29.415 --> 01:09:31.750
I don't feel safe!

01:09:33.753 --> 01:09:35.462
Gia, I...

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:38.382
We trusted you.

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:43.303
My tears are real!

01:09:43.471 --> 01:09:44.805
You are not!

01:09:47.767 --> 01:09:52.062
I can't believe you lied
to all us circus folk.

01:09:54.732 --> 01:09:57.067
Me? Stay with the circus?

01:09:57.235 --> 01:10:02.322
I am a King! I want to rule
New York! We should talk.

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:04.700
Whoa!

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:09.746
Stop it! No means no! Or
in your language... Aah!

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:14.084
Not everything is solved
that way, you know.

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:21.466
Sonya? Are you listening to me?

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:24.761
Now I'm getting the silent
treatment, am I?

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.097
Come over here right now!

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:31.184
Don't shut me out, baby!

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.020
What is wrong with you? Speak!

01:10:37.108 --> 01:10:40.736
Okay... if these are your feelings,
I understand now.

01:10:40.904 --> 01:10:42.571
And I'm going!

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:47.367
It's obvious I'm just an emotional
whoopee cushion for you to sit on!

01:10:48.536 --> 01:10:50.495
When you look for where I am,

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.623
I won't be there!

01:11:18.107 --> 01:11:20.692
Come, everybody. We
have show to do.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.071
But how do I go
on without Marty?

01:11:24.238 --> 01:11:26.073
- Stefano.
- I don't know what to do.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:28.533
You can still do Cannon solo.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:33.246
But... I want to do
solo act with Marty!

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:35.457
And what do I do?

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:39.419
Go back to sitting
and standing and rolling over?

01:11:40.129 --> 01:11:41.588
No.

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:45.175
We can do impossible!

01:11:45.343 --> 01:11:48.553
And we never go back
to way we used to be.

01:11:48.721 --> 01:11:52.057
The way it used to be
isn't the way it was.

01:11:52.225 --> 01:11:57.562
And it won't be the same
without them, whatever way it is.

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:19.793
Well... we're here.

01:12:22.296 --> 01:12:25.632
- Home.
- Huh.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:28.635
My rock looks smaller
than I remember it.

01:12:29.637 --> 01:12:31.304
Look at the mural.

01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:35.308
Doesn't actually capture
the real thing, does it?

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:37.644
Wow.

01:12:39.313 --> 01:12:42.524
I forgot about that wall
in between us, Melman.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:45.360
- Mm-hmm.
- Was that always there?

01:12:50.658 --> 01:12:55.328
Guys, I'm sorry I ever left
the zoo in the first place.

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:56.997
What do you mean?

01:12:57.165 --> 01:13:00.000
I mean, if I had
just stayed put,

01:13:00.168 --> 01:13:03.086
we wouldn't have anything
to be sad about right now.

01:13:05.423 --> 01:13:09.760
Leaving the zoo was the best
thing that ever happened to us.

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:12.679
Really?

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:16.892
Yeah. Out there, in the world,
we were really living.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.435
Yeah! It was exciting!

01:13:18.603 --> 01:13:20.729
It was romantic.
It was dangerous.

01:13:20.897 --> 01:13:22.397
I never felt so alive!

01:13:22.565 --> 01:13:25.859
When we were with the circus,
we were already home.

01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:29.362
I only wish we'd realized
that sooner.

01:13:30.364 --> 01:13:32.991
I'm really going
to Miss those guys.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:36.703
What do you say we go back?

01:13:36.871 --> 01:13:37.704
Really?

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:39.122
- I'm with you!
- I'm in!

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.791
But what do we tell them?

01:13:40.958 --> 01:13:43.919
We make it right by telling
them how wrong we were.

01:13:44.087 --> 01:13:44.920
It's worth a shot.

01:13:45.088 --> 01:13:48.298
And if we go
down in flames, so be it!

01:13:48.466 --> 01:13:49.966
- Yes, let's do this!
- I like it!

01:13:50.134 --> 01:13:51.218
Yeah, yeah!

01:13:51.385 --> 01:13:53.762
Is my neck getting longer?

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.889
Feel my fur. It's so soft.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:57.641
It is soft.

01:13:57.809 --> 01:14:02.395
I'm like a candy cane
in a black and white movie.

01:14:03.523 --> 01:14:04.731
Oh, no.

01:14:05.399 --> 01:14:06.733
Dubois.

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:11.363
Sonya, I Miss you, baby!
I Miss my stinky bear!

01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:14.533
Babe... your fishy kisses!

01:14:16.077 --> 01:14:18.745
Surprise!

01:14:18.913 --> 01:14:22.165
He will never fit
in the carry-on.

01:14:22.333 --> 01:14:26.169
But his head will!

01:14:26.337 --> 01:14:27.504
- Hey!
- Qu'est-ce que c'est?

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:29.881
Look! Look what she's done!

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:32.008
You brought back Alex the lion!

01:14:32.176 --> 01:14:34.928
- It's a miracle!
- Thank you! Thank you!

01:14:35.096 --> 01:14:36.763
Sonya, where are you?

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:38.682
Sonya!

01:14:38.850 --> 01:14:40.016
Excuse me.

01:14:40.184 --> 01:14:44.146
Sonya, baby!

01:14:44.313 --> 01:14:46.189
I don't want to be King anymore!

01:14:46.357 --> 01:14:48.692
I was so Hung up on who I was...

01:14:48.943 --> 01:14:51.528
who you was... what you
smelled like...

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:56.032
when all that really matters
is what we smell like together.

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:01.705
I know! Baby, forgive me.

01:15:01.873 --> 01:15:03.290
Oh, hello?

01:15:03.457 --> 01:15:04.708
Gasp! It's Dubois!

01:15:04.876 --> 01:15:05.876
Baba booey!

01:15:06.878 --> 01:15:09.129
- Where did you get this?
- I got it from the zoo.

01:15:09.297 --> 01:15:11.173
The hippies got ambushed!

01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.300
What? We have to help them!

01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:14.593
But they lied to us!

01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.261
Yeah. Why should we lift a paw?

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:17.929
They are our friends!

01:15:18.097 --> 01:15:19.639
They're not even circus!

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:23.393
That's Bolshevik!

01:15:23.561 --> 01:15:28.607
I never thought I'd say this on American
soil, but the Russki's right!

01:15:35.531 --> 01:15:38.074
Alex! Alex! Alex! Alex!

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:42.037
- Oh, no.
- Alex? Where are you?

01:15:42.205 --> 01:15:44.164
Gloria! Are you Okay?

01:15:44.332 --> 01:15:47.042
- What is happening?
- Alex!

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:49.336
- No, no! No, no!
- Alex the lion!

01:15:49.503 --> 01:15:51.004
No!

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:02.182
Thank you. Thank you all for coming
to this special celebration.

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:05.393
And now, the woman who made
this all possible,

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.729
who brought Alex the lion
and a couple of...

01:16:07.897 --> 01:16:09.231
three?

01:16:09.398 --> 01:16:11.816
Three other animals
back to New York.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:14.236
And she's French. Ooh-la-la.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:16.613
Please welcome Chantal Dubois!

01:16:47.895 --> 01:16:49.354
Alex?

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:01.616
It was never about the money.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.953
It was about...

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.872
the lion.

01:17:14.505 --> 01:17:15.547

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:49.659
What are you doing?

01:19:49.827 --> 01:19:52.328
We are doing trapeze americano.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:54.038
Let's do it!

01:19:55.291 --> 01:19:57.250
- Frankie, Jonesy! Be ready!
- You got it, boss!

01:19:57.418 --> 01:19:58.751
