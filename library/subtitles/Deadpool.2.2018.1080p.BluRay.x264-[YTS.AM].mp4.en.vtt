WEBVTT

00:02:13.716 --> 00:02:17.111
Fuck Wolverine.

00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:19.853
First, he rides my coattails
with the R rating.

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:24.292
Then the hairy motherfucker
ups the ante by dying.

00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:26.512
What a dick.

00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:28.775
Well, guess what, Wolvie?

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.647
I'm dying in this one, too.

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.783
To understand
why I took a cat-nap

00:02:36.827 --> 00:02:38.916
on 1,200 gallons
of high-test fuel...

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:40.308
I need to take you back

00:02:40.352 --> 00:02:42.789
to the dewy slopes
of six weeks ago.

00:02:42.833 --> 00:02:44.182
I'd gone international,

00:02:44.225 --> 00:02:46.140
taking out mass murderers,
gangsters,

00:02:46.184 --> 00:02:47.881
unspeakable monsters.

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:50.884
People nobody would touch.
Except me.

00:02:50.928 --> 00:02:52.886
I'm gonna touch them all over.

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:58.457
Hey, it's Gail calling.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.632
Love the shiny suit.

00:02:59.675 --> 00:03:01.416
Really brings out

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.540
the sex trafficker
in your eyes.

00:03:04.593 --> 00:03:08.684
I don't
speak Cantonese, Mister...

00:03:08.728 --> 00:03:10.861
Well, I'm not even gonna
attempt that.

00:03:10.904 --> 00:03:13.385
But I did take 8th grade Spanish, so...

00:03:15.735 --> 00:03:18.564
Which literally
translates to...

00:03:18.607 --> 00:03:21.654
I don't bargain,
pumpkin fucker.

00:03:31.403 --> 00:03:34.145
Oh. Oh, this isn't Gilbert's.

00:03:34.188 --> 00:03:35.450
I am so sorry.

00:03:35.494 --> 00:03:37.174
I thought this was
an anal-bleaching party.

00:03:59.692 --> 00:04:01.563
Don't worry.
You're not going to die.

00:04:01.607 --> 00:04:03.696
Although these will kill you.

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:04.958
Hit it, Dolly.

00:04:25.239 --> 00:04:26.632
I'm merely
a vessel for the Lord.

00:04:37.904 --> 00:04:40.472
Taking the hands out
of the guns of the criminals!

00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:50.525
Whoo! Do not go in there!

00:04:57.228 --> 00:04:59.317
Let's see
Captain America do that.

00:05:08.282 --> 00:05:09.805
Too exotic?

00:06:31.974 --> 00:06:34.934
Oh, God! Oh, God,
time out! Time out!

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:38.503
Cut. I've got bad guy blood,
right in my open eye.

00:06:38.546 --> 00:06:40.548
Oh, that's so gross.

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.856
Fuck.

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:45.790
Looks like you left
a little landing strip there.

00:06:45.814 --> 00:06:46.859
I like it.

00:06:51.994 --> 00:06:53.605
Oh, man!

00:06:57.957 --> 00:06:59.915
My world tour
brought me home

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:02.396
to this guy,
Sergei Valishnikov.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:03.963
But we'll get to him
in a moment.

00:07:04.006 --> 00:07:05.443
'Cause I know
what you're thinking.

00:07:05.486 --> 00:07:08.228
"I'm so glad
I left the kiddos at home."

00:07:08.272 --> 00:07:09.969
But that's where
you'd be wrong.

00:07:10.012 --> 00:07:12.754
That babysitter of yours
is high as fuck right now...

00:07:12.798 --> 00:07:17.107
and, believe it or not,
Deadpool 2 is a family film.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:18.934
True story.

00:07:18.978 --> 00:07:22.155
And every good family film
starts with a vicious murder.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.289
Bambi, The Lion King, Saw 7.

00:07:25.332 --> 00:07:28.640
Holy shit pickles!
That guy's on fire.

00:07:28.683 --> 00:07:31.599
That's not CGI, folks.
He's actually on fire.

00:07:31.643 --> 00:07:35.037
Yeah. You know I get paid
to take out bad guys, right?

00:07:35.081 --> 00:07:36.300
But this guy?

00:07:36.343 --> 00:07:38.302
He was
one of the worst of 'em.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.523
Hurry up and open
this fucking door,

00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:43.847
and let's kill
this motherfucker!

00:07:50.792 --> 00:07:52.838
Ugh. So gross.

00:07:52.881 --> 00:07:55.710
A panic room? Really?

00:07:55.754 --> 00:07:57.973
Can you come out?

00:07:58.017 --> 00:08:01.107
I really have to go.
It's my anniversary.

00:08:07.026 --> 00:08:08.438
Over and over,
I hear people say,

00:08:08.462 --> 00:08:10.029
"I just don't have
enough confidence."

00:08:10.072 --> 00:08:12.162
Listen, confidence is not
something you have.

00:08:12.205 --> 00:08:13.641
It's something you create.

00:08:13.685 --> 00:08:15.600
And you can create it
at any moment in time.

00:08:15.643 --> 00:08:17.341
A sense of confidence
is nothing

00:08:17.384 --> 00:08:19.125
but a sense of power
within yourself...

00:08:19.169 --> 00:08:20.711
a sense of certainty that
you can pull something off.

00:08:20.735 --> 00:08:22.824
Start the fucking car!

00:08:22.868 --> 00:08:23.999
Dopinder!

00:08:24.043 --> 00:08:25.566
Start the fucking car!

00:08:30.267 --> 00:08:32.747
Shoot that motherfucker!
Shoot him!

00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:34.314
Whoo! Oh, I shit my pants.

00:08:34.358 --> 00:08:36.751
Actually, that may
have been me.

00:08:36.795 --> 00:08:38.057
Oh, mission accomplished?

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.233
Oh, in a George W.
sort of way.

00:08:40.277 --> 00:08:41.974
Fucker can't stay
in a panic room forever.

00:08:42.017 --> 00:08:43.473
Oh, you're living
the dreams, DP.

00:08:43.497 --> 00:08:45.673
It has been
quite the run, Dopinder,

00:08:45.717 --> 00:08:47.022
and who'da thought?

00:08:47.066 --> 00:08:49.503
Now I'm talked about
in the same sentence as Jesus.

00:08:49.547 --> 00:08:51.418
Passion of the Christ, then me.

00:08:51.462 --> 00:08:52.724
At least domestically.

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:53.986
We beat them overseas,

00:08:54.029 --> 00:08:56.031
where there's no such thing
as religion.

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:58.251
I do want to live
the dreams, Pool Boy.

00:08:58.295 --> 00:09:00.688
Taxiing is not as sexy
as it looks.

00:09:00.732 --> 00:09:02.516
I want to fill my... Pockets?

00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:05.780
What's your poison?
A little, uh, cokey cokey?

00:09:05.824 --> 00:09:07.173
Can't maintain an erection

00:09:07.217 --> 00:09:08.759
without buying shoes online?

00:09:08.783 --> 00:09:10.742
I've never experienced
that last one.

00:09:10.785 --> 00:09:12.178
Talk to me, Goose.

00:09:12.222 --> 00:09:14.920
I was going to say "soul".
I want to fill my soul.

00:09:14.963 --> 00:09:18.053
I want to belong to something,
like you, Pool, sir.

00:09:18.097 --> 00:09:20.055
Dopinder... Hmm?

00:09:20.099 --> 00:09:21.927
You never cease
to surprise me.

00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:26.061
You know, the depth of
your heart is extraordinary.

00:09:26.105 --> 00:09:27.759
We all need
a sense of belonging.

00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:29.587
We all need
a genuine sense of home.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:30.762
A place in this world.

00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:32.165
I want to become
a contract killer.

00:09:32.198 --> 00:09:34.026
I'm sorry. What did you say?

00:09:34.069 --> 00:09:36.028
Remember when
I kidnapped Bandhu

00:09:36.071 --> 00:09:37.397
and threatened him
with great violence?

00:09:37.421 --> 00:09:39.031
You kind of killed him.

00:09:39.074 --> 00:09:40.661
And then remember the movie
Interview with the Vampire?

00:09:40.685 --> 00:09:41.860
Don't want to.

00:09:41.903 --> 00:09:42.991
When Tom Cruise fed

00:09:43.035 --> 00:09:44.863
10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst blood

00:09:44.906 --> 00:09:46.125
for the first time...

00:09:46.168 --> 00:09:48.562
and she looked up
at his smooth,

00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:50.825
handsome face and said...

00:09:51.609 --> 00:09:53.393
"I want some more."

00:09:53.437 --> 00:09:57.092
Oh, Pool, picture me,
a 10-year-old Kirsten Dunst.

00:09:58.137 --> 00:10:00.835
I'll never not picture that.

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.663
But I can't wait
to never speak of this,

00:10:02.707 --> 00:10:04.752
as soon as possible.

00:10:04.796 --> 00:10:07.277
We're here.

00:10:14.066 --> 00:10:16.068
Dopinder, it's me again.

00:10:16.111 --> 00:10:17.809
Look, a saner man
might discourage you

00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:19.724
from joining
the deadly merc business...

00:10:19.767 --> 00:10:21.247
what, with your concave chest

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:22.944
and your
paper towel tube arms.

00:10:22.988 --> 00:10:24.685
But you're an eagle...

00:10:24.729 --> 00:10:26.731
and goddamn it,
an eagle's gotta soar.

00:10:26.774 --> 00:10:28.167
You gotta grab those dreams,

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.821
grab those dreams
by the dick tip...

00:10:29.864 --> 00:10:31.388
and make it rain!

00:10:31.431 --> 00:10:33.346
I don't know what that means.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.348
Me neither.

00:10:35.957 --> 00:10:37.437
I'm gonna see you...

00:10:38.743 --> 00:10:40.092
at the office.

00:10:40.658 --> 00:10:41.789
In the sky.

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:42.964
You're my Tom Cruise!

00:10:43.008 --> 00:10:44.618
And you're my Kristen Dunst!

00:10:44.662 --> 00:10:46.141
Kristen? Kirsten?

00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:52.800
Sorry I'm late.

00:10:52.844 --> 00:10:54.411
There was a bunch of

00:10:54.454 --> 00:10:56.543
handicapable children
stuck in a tree...

00:10:56.587 --> 00:10:58.110
and I had to, uh... Uh-uh.

00:10:58.153 --> 00:11:00.895
You're right.
I was fighting a caped badass.

00:11:00.939 --> 00:11:03.289
But then we discovered
his mom is named Martha, too.

00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:05.639
No.You got me.

00:11:05.683 --> 00:11:07.467
I was rounding up
all the gluten in the world

00:11:07.511 --> 00:11:08.729
and launching it into space...

00:11:08.773 --> 00:11:10.905
where it can't not
hurt us ever again.

00:11:10.949 --> 00:11:12.124
Try again.

00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:14.256
Diarrhea?

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.060
We can't be sure
until I get this suit off...

00:11:16.998 --> 00:11:18.957
but, uh,
all signs point to yes.

00:11:20.872 --> 00:11:21.873
Traffic?

00:11:22.482 --> 00:11:23.527
Hmm?

00:11:24.745 --> 00:11:26.399
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

00:11:26.443 --> 00:11:27.443
Well, come here.

00:11:39.151 --> 00:11:41.588
I'm gonna shower
and get out of this suit.

00:11:41.632 --> 00:11:42.807
Don't you want
your surprise?

00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.678
Do I look like
a patient burn victim?

00:11:45.462 --> 00:11:46.724
I got one for you, too.

00:11:47.855 --> 00:11:49.379
Happy anniversary, baby.

00:11:49.422 --> 00:11:50.989
Open, open, open.

00:11:52.991 --> 00:11:54.732
Skee-Ball token.

00:11:54.775 --> 00:11:56.168
Our first date.

00:11:56.211 --> 00:11:57.778
Yup.

00:11:57.822 --> 00:12:00.477
That's genuine,
high-grade lead.

00:12:03.393 --> 00:12:05.699
I'll keep it forever.

00:12:05.743 --> 00:12:07.179
Thank you, baby.

00:12:08.789 --> 00:12:10.487
Open yours. All right, all right.

00:12:11.401 --> 00:12:12.706
Oh...

00:12:14.099 --> 00:12:15.990
That's just the most
beautiful thing that I've...

00:12:16.014 --> 00:12:17.407
I don't know
what this is.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:19.278
My IUD.

00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:20.497
A bomb?

00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:23.630
No, dick for brains.
My birth control device.

00:12:23.674 --> 00:12:24.762
What, you mean that your...

00:12:24.805 --> 00:12:26.546
Baby factory's open
for business.

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:27.895
Oh, my God!

00:12:27.939 --> 00:12:31.203
Oh, my God! I want a boy!

00:12:31.246 --> 00:12:34.336
Or a little girl!
Definitely one or the other!

00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.165
Oh! And I want our kid
to have only one name.

00:12:37.731 --> 00:12:40.995
Like Cher or Todd.

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:42.823
You gotta pump a baby
in me first, cowboy.

00:12:42.867 --> 00:12:44.216
Yes, I do.

00:12:44.259 --> 00:12:45.759
Let's watch some porn
and show that bed who's boss.

00:12:45.783 --> 00:12:46.784
Let's do that.

00:12:48.002 --> 00:12:50.135
♪ Papa... ♪

00:12:50.178 --> 00:12:52.354
♪ Can you hear me? ♪

00:12:53.791 --> 00:12:56.446
♪ Papa, can you see me? ♪

00:12:56.489 --> 00:12:58.709
Does this song
sound familiar to you?

00:13:01.015 --> 00:13:03.191
May.

00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:06.934
Connor, if it's a boy.
May, if it's a girl.

00:13:09.589 --> 00:13:12.026
So weird.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:14.464
Family was always
an F-word to me.

00:13:15.987 --> 00:13:20.339
My pile of shit father
took off and bailed.

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:22.602
I mean, it's not like I have
a lot of strong role models

00:13:22.646 --> 00:13:24.386
to draw off of for Todd.

00:13:25.562 --> 00:13:28.173
Hey. Look at me.

00:13:29.348 --> 00:13:31.481
You are not your father.

00:13:33.221 --> 00:13:34.658
Besides...

00:13:34.701 --> 00:13:39.445
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

00:13:40.446 --> 00:13:41.491
But here's the thing,

00:13:41.534 --> 00:13:43.362
isn't that how
it always works?

00:13:43.405 --> 00:13:44.929
Like in Star Wars,

00:13:44.972 --> 00:13:47.671
men are destined
to become their father...

00:13:47.714 --> 00:13:50.804
and then have consensual sex
with their sister?

00:13:50.848 --> 00:13:54.155
I think you missed
big, big chunks of that movie.

00:13:54.199 --> 00:13:56.462
No, I'm pretty sure
Luke nailed her.

00:13:56.506 --> 00:13:58.551
Baby, that's Empire.

00:13:58.595 --> 00:14:01.206
The point is, kids...

00:14:02.686 --> 00:14:05.340
they give us a chance
to be better than we are.

00:14:06.167 --> 00:14:08.822
Better than we used to be.

00:14:08.866 --> 00:14:11.390
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

00:14:12.434 --> 00:14:14.088
I'm gonna go make dessert.

00:14:14.132 --> 00:14:18.571
You get the strap-on.
Let's make a super baby.

00:14:18.615 --> 00:14:22.009
Pretty sure it doesn't work
that way, but we can try.

00:14:22.053 --> 00:14:25.578
What about Krystal?
But with a "K"?

00:14:25.622 --> 00:14:27.580
It's too stripper-y.

00:14:27.624 --> 00:14:29.147
Kevin with a "K"!

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:31.279
No, too stripper-y, too.

00:14:31.845 --> 00:14:33.760
Uh, Earl!

00:14:33.804 --> 00:14:36.154
He's gonna go straight to jail

00:14:36.197 --> 00:14:38.417
if we name him Earl.

00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.332
What about Bruce?

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:42.769
No.

00:14:42.813 --> 00:14:43.857
Get down.

00:14:43.901 --> 00:14:45.293
What?

00:15:14.192 --> 00:15:16.281
Baby? Baby?

00:15:19.545 --> 00:15:21.242
I'm okay.

00:15:21.286 --> 00:15:23.941
Thank God I didn't have to use
the cream cheese spreader.

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.803
Please.

00:16:04.895 --> 00:16:06.723
Please. Please.

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:09.943
Baby, I'm so sorry.

00:16:09.987 --> 00:16:13.773
No!

00:19:18.305 --> 00:19:21.004
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

00:19:21.961 --> 00:19:23.745
Is it just me, or does

00:19:23.789 --> 00:19:25.375
Do You Want to Build
a Snowman? from Frozen...

00:19:25.399 --> 00:19:26.705
sound suspiciously like

00:19:26.748 --> 00:19:28.707
Papa, Can You Hear Me?
from Yentl?

00:19:30.056 --> 00:19:32.189
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

00:19:33.973 --> 00:19:36.584
And nobody
fucking realizes it.

00:19:36.628 --> 00:19:38.195
Wade, you gotta go home.

00:19:38.238 --> 00:19:40.980
You've been sitting here
for three days, okay?

00:19:41.024 --> 00:19:44.723
You smell like sauerkraut
left in the warm rain.

00:19:44.766 --> 00:19:47.073
Like wet garbage
in hot urine.

00:19:47.117 --> 00:19:49.293
You smell like
a dog ate kitty litter...

00:19:49.336 --> 00:19:51.382
and then farted his way
out of the living room.

00:19:51.425 --> 00:19:53.253
I mean, like Rush Limbaugh's

00:19:53.297 --> 00:19:55.125
couch cushions
after Shark Week.

00:19:55.168 --> 00:19:56.909
I love Frozen.

00:19:56.953 --> 00:20:00.521
I loved her. I loved her
like an ocean loves water.

00:20:00.565 --> 00:20:02.088
An ocean is water.

00:20:02.132 --> 00:20:06.876
More importantly, I liked her.
I really liked her, you know?

00:20:06.919 --> 00:20:08.051
George Michael was right.

00:20:08.094 --> 00:20:09.922
I'm never gonna
dance again. Fuck!

00:20:10.531 --> 00:20:11.532
He's dead, too.

00:20:12.707 --> 00:20:14.057
At least we still have Bowie.

00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.841
Oh, Mr. Pool.
David Bowie is...

00:20:15.885 --> 00:20:17.147
Uh, uh, uh...

00:20:17.190 --> 00:20:18.365
still with us.

00:20:18.409 --> 00:20:21.281
We do.
We'll always have Bowie.

00:20:21.891 --> 00:20:22.935
I'm sorry.

00:20:22.979 --> 00:20:24.415
Shot after shot,

00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:26.306
it's not gonna change the fact
that I think you're...

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:27.960
Are you pissing?
Are you urinating right now?

00:20:27.984 --> 00:20:30.900
You're making the face that
you make when you urinate.

00:20:30.943 --> 00:20:32.510
Is he pissing? I'm on it!

00:20:32.553 --> 00:20:34.033
There you go, Dopinder.

00:20:34.077 --> 00:20:36.122
If you want to be
a contract killer...

00:20:36.166 --> 00:20:38.733
you gotta handle a mop
before you handle a gun.

00:20:38.777 --> 00:20:39.841
Although I don't
quite understand

00:20:39.865 --> 00:20:41.432
how they are at all similar.

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:43.584
'Cause I could shove either
one up your ass and kill you.

00:20:43.608 --> 00:20:44.739
Now, leave me.

00:20:44.783 --> 00:20:45.784
I get it.

00:20:46.306 --> 00:20:47.917
Go home, Wade.

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:50.310
I don't have a home,
Weas, you know. I got a...

00:20:51.746 --> 00:20:53.139
Okay, I'm fine.

00:20:53.183 --> 00:20:54.314
I'm fine.

00:20:54.358 --> 00:20:56.186
You know what "fine"
stands for, Wade?

00:20:56.229 --> 00:20:59.972
Fucked up, insecure,
needy, and emotional.

00:21:00.016 --> 00:21:01.234
According to the...

00:21:02.583 --> 00:21:04.020
Kubler-Ross.Yeah.

00:21:04.063 --> 00:21:05.935
According to
the Kubler-Ross model...

00:21:05.978 --> 00:21:08.763
denial is just one of
the five stages of grief.

00:21:08.807 --> 00:21:11.157
Jesus Christ, Buck!

00:21:11.201 --> 00:21:13.116
No more speaking lines
for you.

00:21:21.776 --> 00:21:24.127
Hey, bud. Bud.

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:26.259
- Huh?
- Got a match?

00:21:26.303 --> 00:21:27.826
Match?

00:21:27.869 --> 00:21:29.349
Yes, I have one right here.

00:21:29.393 --> 00:21:30.761
Don't make a move.
This is a stick-up.

00:21:30.785 --> 00:21:32.526
- What?
- You heard me.

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.615
Mister, Mister,
put down that gun.

00:21:34.659 --> 00:21:37.270
Shut up. Now, come on.
Your money or your life?

00:21:45.452 --> 00:21:49.195
Look, bud. I said,
"Your money or your life."

00:21:49.239 --> 00:21:50.544
"I'm thinking it over!"

00:21:50.588 --> 00:21:51.981
Motherfuck!

00:21:52.024 --> 00:21:53.069
Fuck!

00:21:56.072 --> 00:21:57.551
The hell you doin' here?

00:21:57.595 --> 00:21:59.684
Don't you know how to knock?

00:21:59.727 --> 00:22:01.642
I thought you saw me...

00:22:01.686 --> 00:22:03.209
with your ears.

00:22:03.253 --> 00:22:04.317
You're lucky I didn't
shoot you in the...

00:22:04.341 --> 00:22:05.385
The wall?

00:22:05.429 --> 00:22:08.823
The refrigerator?
I'm in so much pain.

00:22:11.609 --> 00:22:13.219
I heard the news,
sweetie.

00:22:13.263 --> 00:22:15.352
I'm very sorry. I am.

00:22:15.395 --> 00:22:17.310
What am I gonna do, Al?

00:22:17.354 --> 00:22:19.051
Probably something terrible.

00:22:20.226 --> 00:22:21.619
Knowing you.

00:22:21.662 --> 00:22:23.186
It was my fault.

00:22:24.404 --> 00:22:27.103
I fucking did this.

00:22:27.146 --> 00:22:29.018
And all I wanna do
is grab her and see her

00:22:29.061 --> 00:22:31.020
and tell her that I'm sorry,
and I can't.

00:22:33.022 --> 00:22:34.675
She's gone.

00:22:34.719 --> 00:22:38.505
Sweetheart,
can you speak up?

00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:39.811
It's a little hard
to hear you

00:22:39.854 --> 00:22:41.552
with that pity dick
in your mouth.

00:22:41.595 --> 00:22:44.642
Now, look, sugar.
You need to just keep living.

00:22:44.685 --> 00:22:45.991
Thank you...

00:22:46.035 --> 00:22:49.038
Matthew McConaughey,
your words are a treasure.

00:22:49.081 --> 00:22:51.127
Listen to the pain.

00:22:51.170 --> 00:22:53.955
It's both history teacher
and fortune teller.

00:22:53.999 --> 00:22:57.611
Pain teaches us
who we are, Wade.

00:22:57.655 --> 00:23:01.528
Sometimes, it's so bad,
we feel like we're dying.

00:23:01.572 --> 00:23:04.270
But we can't really live till
we've died a little, can we?

00:23:06.794 --> 00:23:08.013
Wade?

00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.626
Wade? I'm right here, Althea.

00:23:12.670 --> 00:23:15.281
And that is
the most beautiful thing

00:23:15.325 --> 00:23:16.543
I've ever heard.

00:23:17.283 --> 00:23:18.850
And you're absolutely right.

00:23:22.723 --> 00:23:25.074
I'm about to do
something terrible.

00:23:31.123 --> 00:23:32.385
Precious, aren't they?

00:23:33.212 --> 00:23:34.648
Whoa!

00:23:34.692 --> 00:23:36.128
Are you a superhero?

00:23:36.172 --> 00:23:37.869
Fucking A, sweetie.

00:23:37.912 --> 00:23:39.479
What's your name?

00:23:39.523 --> 00:23:41.307
Captain Delicious Pants.

00:23:41.351 --> 00:23:43.527
Who's Captain Delicious Pants?

00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:10.902
I can't believe
he's still alive.

00:24:10.945 --> 00:24:13.426
I can't believe you left
the house in that shirt.

00:24:14.906 --> 00:24:16.864
There's gotta be
some way to die.

00:24:16.908 --> 00:24:18.953
I just need to die harder.

00:24:18.997 --> 00:24:20.216
Trademark Fox.

00:24:20.259 --> 00:24:21.260
Y'all caught up now?

00:24:34.534 --> 00:24:36.188
Open for business.

00:24:40.061 --> 00:24:42.194
Your crazy
matches my crazy.

00:24:42.238 --> 00:24:44.390
I will never, ever
let our child be named Todd.

00:24:44.414 --> 00:24:45.676
Skee-Ball token.

00:24:45.719 --> 00:24:46.999
You're a lot smarter
than I look.

00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:54.182
About why
we're so good together.

00:24:54.206 --> 00:24:55.401
I love you,
Wade Wilson.

00:24:58.036 --> 00:24:59.429
Ness?

00:25:00.908 --> 00:25:02.040
Ness?

00:25:02.867 --> 00:25:04.434
Ness.

00:25:04.477 --> 00:25:07.176
Ness, there's something here.
I can't get to you.

00:25:08.873 --> 00:25:11.397
Your heart's not
in the right place.

00:25:11.441 --> 00:25:14.095
Wait, hold on. What?

00:25:14.139 --> 00:25:16.228
Your heart's not
in the right place.

00:25:16.272 --> 00:25:17.664
Wait. What do you mean

00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:19.668
my heart's not in the right
place? What does it...

00:25:38.903 --> 00:25:41.427
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss, Wade.

00:25:41.906 --> 00:25:43.037
You're broken.

00:25:43.081 --> 00:25:46.040
Oh, God.
I know that voice.

00:26:07.105 --> 00:26:08.541
Well, Russell.

00:26:08.585 --> 00:26:11.240
I hear you're handy
at picking locks.

00:26:12.632 --> 00:26:14.852
There will be no need
for that here.

00:26:14.895 --> 00:26:18.203
There's no locks on our doors,
no bars on our windows.

00:26:19.552 --> 00:26:21.598
I know what you're thinking.

00:26:21.641 --> 00:26:24.296
Why don't the kids just run?

00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.299
Who would choose to stay
in such a place?

00:26:27.343 --> 00:26:29.823
You stay because...

00:26:29.867 --> 00:26:34.611
deep down inside, you know
you're unfit to leave.

00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:40.007
Don't worry.

00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:42.836
We can fix that.

00:26:47.667 --> 00:26:51.410
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand.

00:27:13.389 --> 00:27:15.086
"Heart's in the right place."

00:27:15.129 --> 00:27:16.585
"Heart's in the right..."
What does that mean?

00:27:16.609 --> 00:27:18.524
Take your mask off, Wade.

00:27:18.568 --> 00:27:20.265
I wish you'd said "pants".

00:27:20.309 --> 00:27:21.527
Let's play a game.

00:27:21.571 --> 00:27:24.095
It's called
"Adrien Brody or Adam Brody?".

00:27:24.138 --> 00:27:26.489
Now, close your eyes
and open your mouth.

00:27:26.532 --> 00:27:28.360
You don't need
to be funny here.

00:27:28.969 --> 00:27:30.231
We must talk.

00:27:30.275 --> 00:27:32.756
You need fresh start.

00:27:32.799 --> 00:27:34.366
Such a glare.

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.673
It's like I'm on stage
at the Gaiety.

00:27:36.716 --> 00:27:39.328
With training,
you can be X-Man.

00:27:39.371 --> 00:27:41.460
You're wasting your time,
Shiny Jesus.

00:27:41.504 --> 00:27:42.809
I'm not X-Man material.

00:27:42.853 --> 00:27:44.420
Understatement of the year.

00:27:44.898 --> 00:27:45.899
Wade, Yukio.

00:27:46.378 --> 00:27:48.293
Yukio, Wade.

00:27:48.337 --> 00:27:50.426
What in the fuck knuckles
is this?

00:27:50.469 --> 00:27:53.124
She's my girlfriend,
you intolerant shit.

00:27:53.167 --> 00:27:54.995
Whoa! Pump the hate brakes,
Fox & Friends.

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:56.910
I'm just surprised
anyone would date you.

00:27:56.954 --> 00:27:59.565
Especially Pinkie Pie
from My Little Pony.

00:27:59.609 --> 00:28:01.437
I like this guy.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:03.569
Give him a chance.

00:28:03.613 --> 00:28:04.720
It's great seeing you
like this.

00:28:04.744 --> 00:28:06.920
Yeah.

00:28:07.399 --> 00:28:08.705
Bye, Wade!

00:28:08.748 --> 00:28:11.229
Now, some ground rules
while under our roof.

00:28:11.272 --> 00:28:14.058
"Rule number one.
No killing...

00:28:14.101 --> 00:28:17.540
"anyone ever,
no matter how bad.

00:28:17.583 --> 00:28:20.238
"Rule two. Label everything
in refrigerator."

00:28:20.281 --> 00:28:21.282
Wade?

00:28:22.153 --> 00:28:23.415
Wade?

00:28:23.459 --> 00:28:25.286
Don't try to chase me. Wade!

00:28:25.330 --> 00:28:27.419
I'm not ready
to be touched again.

00:28:27.463 --> 00:28:29.682
All these old guys
on the wall.

00:28:29.726 --> 00:28:31.815
Who lives here,
Calista Flockhart?

00:28:34.121 --> 00:28:37.037
Those were already damaged
after they fell there!

00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:38.952
What am I supposed
to do around here, anyway?

00:28:38.996 --> 00:28:41.259
Sit in a share circle,
talk about my feelings?

00:28:41.302 --> 00:28:44.175
And how would I
do that exactly?

00:28:44.218 --> 00:28:46.656
'Cause where the fuck
is everyone?

00:28:46.699 --> 00:28:47.918
It's always just you

00:28:47.961 --> 00:28:49.286
and Negasonic Teenage
Longest Name Ever...

00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:50.529
Enough!

00:28:50.573 --> 00:28:52.401
I said no touching!

00:28:54.185 --> 00:28:57.449
What the fuck?

00:28:57.493 --> 00:28:59.669
You'd think the studio
would throw us a bone.

00:28:59.712 --> 00:29:02.541
One that doesn't end up
in my mouth.

00:29:02.585 --> 00:29:03.779
The first movie
made more money

00:29:03.803 --> 00:29:06.153
than the guy
who invented pants.

00:29:06.197 --> 00:29:08.373
They can't just dust off
one of the famous X-Men?

00:29:08.417 --> 00:29:10.506
How 'bout that putz
with the giant pigeon wings?

00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:11.855
What do those do anyway, huh?

00:29:11.898 --> 00:29:13.378
Carry him
three feet off the ground

00:29:13.422 --> 00:29:15.467
to snatch up
the nearest muffin crumb?

00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:17.687
No, no, no!

00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:20.472
I am not X-Man material
at all.

00:29:20.516 --> 00:29:23.170
First off...

00:29:23.214 --> 00:29:25.259
I'm not even a virgin.
Second and more...

00:29:27.479 --> 00:29:28.524
I should have left you

00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:30.308
in the self-pitying mess
I found you in.

00:29:30.351 --> 00:29:33.442
But this is what friends do.
They show up!

00:29:33.485 --> 00:29:35.487
Not when convenient or easy.

00:29:35.531 --> 00:29:39.839
When hard,
and you always make it hard.

00:29:39.883 --> 00:29:42.363
You are unwell.

00:29:42.407 --> 00:29:44.496
I'm sticking my neck out
bringing you here.

00:29:44.540 --> 00:29:46.455
Wait.
One of the assholes

00:29:46.498 --> 00:29:47.978
who killed Vanessa got away.

00:29:50.546 --> 00:29:52.722
Oh, Jesus Christ!

00:29:52.765 --> 00:29:54.656
I thought you were gonna
kiss me for a second there.

00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.615
Please know I wouldn't be
able to stop you if you did.

00:29:56.639 --> 00:29:58.684
Wade, whoever they are...

00:29:58.728 --> 00:30:01.078
we track them down
and bring them to justice.

00:30:01.644 --> 00:30:03.080
It was me.

00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:08.564
I'm the asshole who got away.

00:30:08.607 --> 00:30:11.741
I killed every last one
of them, except me.

00:30:11.784 --> 00:30:13.482
Couldn't kill me.

00:30:16.615 --> 00:30:18.617
We were gonna start a family.

00:30:20.445 --> 00:30:22.403
We were, uh...

00:30:23.622 --> 00:30:25.363
We were gonna be a family.

00:30:26.146 --> 00:30:27.278
Wade...

00:30:27.321 --> 00:30:30.107
Vanessa is gone.
She's not coming back.

00:30:31.674 --> 00:30:34.024
This may not be
family you want...

00:30:34.067 --> 00:30:36.505
but it's family you need.

00:30:36.548 --> 00:30:37.810
You have a good heart.

00:30:37.854 --> 00:30:39.420
It belongs here
where it can grow.

00:30:41.205 --> 00:30:42.206
What did you say?

00:30:44.251 --> 00:30:45.557
About my heart?

00:30:50.997 --> 00:30:52.999
I think
I'm in the right place.

00:32:00.806 --> 00:32:03.635
I'mma tell you
what the big lie is.

00:32:03.679 --> 00:32:05.289
Toilet paper.

00:32:05.332 --> 00:32:06.725
What's so bad
about toilet paper?

00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:07.987
Gets the job done.

00:32:08.031 --> 00:32:10.903
Does it really
get the job done?

00:32:10.947 --> 00:32:13.166
All right. Say you wake up
tomorrow morning...

00:32:13.210 --> 00:32:17.910
and, hypothetically, find some
fresh shit on your face.

00:32:17.954 --> 00:32:19.671
Your cheek, maybe
a little bit in the beard.

00:32:19.695 --> 00:32:21.411
What the hell?
I'm about to be fucking sick!

00:32:21.435 --> 00:32:22.523
What do you do?

00:32:22.567 --> 00:32:23.873
Do you go to a bathroom

00:32:23.916 --> 00:32:25.614
and tear off
a piece of dry tissue...

00:32:25.657 --> 00:32:27.528
and rub it around
on your beard a little bit

00:32:27.572 --> 00:32:29.139
and then go on,
get on with your day?

00:32:29.182 --> 00:32:30.793
Go to church,
maybe dinner and a movie,

00:32:30.836 --> 00:32:31.968
like nothing happened?

00:32:32.011 --> 00:32:33.404
Where is this
coming from, man?

00:32:33.447 --> 00:32:34.666
But something did happen.

00:32:34.710 --> 00:32:36.189
Your face smells like shit.
Right?

00:32:36.233 --> 00:32:37.800
So what you would do,

00:32:37.843 --> 00:32:40.106
is you would get some soap,
you'd get some hot water...

00:32:40.150 --> 00:32:42.500
and you would scrub
the fucking shit

00:32:42.543 --> 00:32:44.545
out of your beard
for 10 straight minutes.

00:32:44.589 --> 00:32:46.286
You could not
scrub it enough.

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.984
Are you trying
to make me feel disgusting?

00:32:48.027 --> 00:32:49.246
I'm starting to feel...

00:32:49.289 --> 00:32:51.988
Toilet paper is
a pretty fine appetizer.

00:32:52.031 --> 00:32:54.338
But, then...

00:32:54.381 --> 00:32:56.688
Huggies Natural Care
wet wipes.

00:32:56.732 --> 00:32:58.124
That's your main course.

00:32:58.168 --> 00:33:02.085
They're soft, they're moist.
They're for babies.

00:33:02.128 --> 00:33:04.914
Finally, one more pass
with toilet paper,

00:33:04.957 --> 00:33:06.872
maybe clear out
that excess moisture.

00:33:06.916 --> 00:33:08.569
Maybe treat yourself
to a blow and go,

00:33:08.613 --> 00:33:09.919
if you can get you
a hair dryer.

00:33:09.962 --> 00:33:12.312
Just about 30 seconds
would do you good.

00:33:16.012 --> 00:33:17.013
The fuck?

00:33:18.275 --> 00:33:19.319
Year.

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.321
What?

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.194
What year is it?

00:33:24.237 --> 00:33:26.675
What kind of dumbass question
is that to ask?

00:33:57.444 --> 00:34:00.230
We have 8 weeks of
boot camp ahead of us, men.

00:34:00.273 --> 00:34:01.622
That'll get us
toned and prepared

00:34:01.666 --> 00:34:03.233
for all manner of combat.

00:34:05.322 --> 00:34:09.543
Not working out at all.

00:34:09.587 --> 00:34:11.241
Masking tape.

00:34:11.284 --> 00:34:13.634
It is no friend
to chilled aluminum.

00:34:14.723 --> 00:34:16.725
Velcro.
Color-coded, efficient,

00:34:16.768 --> 00:34:17.813
environmentally friendly.

00:34:18.596 --> 00:34:20.163
Who is he talking to?

00:34:20.206 --> 00:34:21.880
And why is he dressed like
a registered sex offender?

00:34:21.904 --> 00:34:23.906
Can we focus
for a moment, ladies?

00:34:23.949 --> 00:34:26.256
Please, we need to talk about
next month's meal plan.

00:34:26.299 --> 00:34:28.084
Obviously,
everyone hated the ceviche.

00:34:28.127 --> 00:34:29.476
I read the suggestion box.

00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.130
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

00:34:31.174 --> 00:34:33.176
I see through this weak act.

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:37.571
You may have fooled Colossus
with this nice guy shit...

00:34:37.615 --> 00:34:38.790
but not me.

00:34:38.834 --> 00:34:39.922
Don't be mean.

00:34:39.965 --> 00:34:41.314
Back off, NTW.

00:34:41.358 --> 00:34:43.577
No, no, no. Let her go.

00:34:43.621 --> 00:34:44.796
Let her go, it's okay.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:46.406
She has a right
to be skeptical.

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:49.061
Look at me.
I'm an easy target.

00:34:50.236 --> 00:34:51.629
You know, historically,

00:34:51.672 --> 00:34:53.587
mischief has been
my mistress...

00:34:53.631 --> 00:34:56.286
so I understand, you know.
But I like to think...

00:34:57.896 --> 00:35:01.204
that you guys have
really rubbed off on me.

00:35:01.247 --> 00:35:03.327
I like to think that I've
rubbed off around you, too.

00:35:05.295 --> 00:35:07.253
A lot.

00:35:07.297 --> 00:35:09.952
And for the first time
in a long while...

00:35:09.995 --> 00:35:11.170
I like me.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.914
I accept your apology. I never apologized.

00:35:15.958 --> 00:35:17.524
I was talking to your heart.

00:35:17.568 --> 00:35:19.962
See? You're not
lost cause you thought.

00:35:20.005 --> 00:35:23.226
I'm proud. You're everything
I knew you can be.

00:35:23.269 --> 00:35:25.271
Thank you, Colossus.

00:35:25.315 --> 00:35:26.925
Just trying to be
the world's best X-Man.

00:35:26.969 --> 00:35:28.405
Sorry, X-Person.

00:35:29.972 --> 00:35:32.670
Hmm. Something wrong
with the soap.

00:35:32.713 --> 00:35:34.324
It's fine.

00:35:34.367 --> 00:35:36.587
I just filled it. Give it
a few more pumps there.

00:35:37.806 --> 00:35:40.286
Now, if you'll excuse me...

00:35:40.330 --> 00:35:42.114
it's dust bunny season...

00:35:42.158 --> 00:35:43.159
and I'm hunting wabbits.

00:35:43.899 --> 00:35:44.987
Bye, Wade!

00:35:47.163 --> 00:35:49.730
Fuck.
Fuck you.

00:36:01.394 --> 00:36:03.962
No one is born perfect.

00:36:04.006 --> 00:36:06.008
But you can be.

00:36:06.051 --> 00:36:08.401
I know you're doing
what comes naturally.

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:14.538
You can't help yourself.

00:36:18.411 --> 00:36:20.500
But you can.

00:36:20.544 --> 00:36:23.634
It takes work, discipline...

00:36:23.677 --> 00:36:24.896
and treatment.

00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:26.637
Your abilities...

00:36:28.595 --> 00:36:31.381
I know how seductive they are.

00:36:31.424 --> 00:36:34.558
How powerful
they make you feel.

00:36:34.601 --> 00:36:37.126
But you must learn
never to use them...

00:36:37.169 --> 00:36:39.780
so they will never use you.

00:36:46.004 --> 00:36:47.614
Please don't cry.

00:36:48.441 --> 00:36:50.052
I'm going to help.

00:36:50.095 --> 00:36:53.272
I'm gonna make you feel
what you should feel.

00:36:53.316 --> 00:36:55.840
How you need to feel...

00:36:55.884 --> 00:36:59.235
every time you're tempted
to act upon your urges.

00:36:59.278 --> 00:37:03.195
Suck my mutant dick,
you four-eyed fuck.

00:37:17.601 --> 00:37:18.819
Wade.

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:21.387
Wade!

00:37:21.431 --> 00:37:23.520
Come in!
Hey, I was just doing

00:37:23.563 --> 00:37:25.478
a little bit
of light reading here...

00:37:25.522 --> 00:37:26.958
We have mission.

00:37:27.002 --> 00:37:28.525
Well, you guys be
safe out there.

00:37:28.568 --> 00:37:29.830
I'll be praying for you.

00:37:29.874 --> 00:37:32.268
No, I want you to join.

00:37:33.486 --> 00:37:34.661
I'm sorry, what?

00:37:34.705 --> 00:37:36.315
You heard me.

00:37:36.359 --> 00:37:38.752
Trust me,
that's a terrible idea.

00:37:38.796 --> 00:37:39.884
I'm really not ready.

00:37:39.928 --> 00:37:41.625
You are ready. I'm not.

00:37:41.668 --> 00:37:43.540
Be at the X-Jet in five.

00:37:43.583 --> 00:37:44.758
I can do thirty.

00:37:44.802 --> 00:37:46.760
Now. I can do now.

00:37:46.804 --> 00:37:48.023
Final offer.

00:37:48.066 --> 00:37:50.634
Irene Merryweather, WHIT News.

00:37:50.677 --> 00:37:52.679
Live here
at a breaking news situation

00:37:52.723 --> 00:37:55.378
at the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation.

00:37:55.421 --> 00:37:57.380
A mutant boy
is appearing to have

00:37:57.423 --> 00:37:58.903
some sort of an incident...

00:37:58.947 --> 00:38:00.446
- with police here behind me.
- Get away from me!

00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:02.907
There are two police vehicles
that are overturned.

00:38:02.951 --> 00:38:04.406
There are open fires. Fuck off! Stay back!

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:05.494
A scene of
absolute chaos here.

00:38:05.518 --> 00:38:06.650
Calm down.

00:38:06.693 --> 00:38:09.305
I'll burn you!
You stay back!

00:38:10.045 --> 00:38:11.829
Get away from me!

00:38:11.872 --> 00:38:14.353
You wanna fucking die?

00:38:29.368 --> 00:38:32.589
And it appears as if the X-Men
are arriving...

00:38:32.632 --> 00:38:34.156
Scatter!

00:38:34.199 --> 00:38:36.201
...with what appears
to be a trainee.

00:38:36.245 --> 00:38:39.248
Everyone, calm down!
The pros are here. I...

00:38:39.291 --> 00:38:40.466
We're the X-Men!

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.034
A dated metaphor for racism
in the '60s.

00:38:43.078 --> 00:38:45.602
So, respect.

00:38:45.645 --> 00:38:46.907
At ease, Officer.

00:38:48.474 --> 00:38:49.998
What are you doing?

00:38:50.476 --> 00:38:51.782
My job!

00:38:51.825 --> 00:38:53.225
You're the one who said
I was ready,

00:38:53.262 --> 00:38:54.785
and I frankly disagreed
with you.

00:38:54.828 --> 00:38:57.222
But here we are, trying to
overcome our differences.

00:38:57.266 --> 00:38:59.703
Like Beyonce says, "Please...

00:39:00.530 --> 00:39:01.922
"Please, stop cheating on me."

00:39:01.966 --> 00:39:03.054
Hey!

00:39:03.098 --> 00:39:04.490
This is the fifth incident.

00:39:04.534 --> 00:39:06.753
This kid needs to be
in the Ice Box, not here.

00:39:06.797 --> 00:39:08.451
Russell belongs in our care.

00:39:08.494 --> 00:39:10.279
Not in prison.
I assure you...

00:39:10.322 --> 00:39:11.473
we have everything
under control.

00:39:11.497 --> 00:39:12.605
Stay back!
I'll burn you!

00:39:12.629 --> 00:39:13.847
Not getting a real

00:39:13.891 --> 00:39:15.980
"under control"
vibe here, Marty.

00:39:16.024 --> 00:39:18.069
It is Glen, isn't it? Daniel.

00:39:18.113 --> 00:39:19.331
I'll ask the questions,
Miguel.

00:39:19.375 --> 00:39:20.724
Let me talk to the kid.

00:39:20.767 --> 00:39:25.598
You stay here with your weird,
secret sex lips.

00:39:27.339 --> 00:39:28.384
You wanna die?

00:39:28.427 --> 00:39:29.622
This kid's adorable.

00:39:29.646 --> 00:39:30.666
I don't know why I packed
the hollow points.

00:39:30.690 --> 00:39:31.865
I'll burn your balls off!

00:39:31.909 --> 00:39:35.260
First day.
I'm so nervous!

00:39:35.304 --> 00:39:36.870
Did you just say
"hollow points"?

00:39:36.914 --> 00:39:38.263
Yeah, probably should've

00:39:38.307 --> 00:39:40.352
brought a Super Soaker.

00:39:40.918 --> 00:39:41.919
Hi, there!

00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:45.705
Stay back
or Justin Bieber dies!

00:39:45.749 --> 00:39:49.231
Justin Bieber.
He called you Justin Bieber.

00:39:50.623 --> 00:39:52.297
Hold on! Wait, wait, wait!

00:39:52.321 --> 00:39:55.454
Okay, let's not do
whatever that is.

00:39:55.498 --> 00:39:57.021
Okay? Let's just talk!

00:39:57.065 --> 00:39:58.675
It's Russell, right?

00:39:58.718 --> 00:40:00.981
Firefist.Firefist.

00:40:01.025 --> 00:40:03.245
Ooh, that's a great name.
Where does it burn?

00:40:03.288 --> 00:40:05.088
Just the fist, or all the way
up to the elbow?

00:40:09.773 --> 00:40:12.428
Definitely all
the way up to the elbow.

00:40:12.471 --> 00:40:15.300
Come quietly,
or there will be trouble.

00:40:15.344 --> 00:40:18.129
You stole that from Robocop!
That's from Robocop!

00:40:18.173 --> 00:40:19.826
Just stand down!

00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:21.959
You're embarrassing me.
Look, Fire...

00:40:23.308 --> 00:40:25.832
Oh, my God! I can't say it!
I'm so sorry!

00:40:30.359 --> 00:40:34.363
Oh, shit!
That fucking does it!

00:40:34.406 --> 00:40:35.799
Put your hands
behind your knees

00:40:35.842 --> 00:40:37.322
and get down
on your head! Now!

00:40:37.366 --> 00:40:39.629
Wade! What was first rule?

00:40:39.672 --> 00:40:41.631
Label everything
in the refrigerator!

00:40:41.674 --> 00:40:44.286
Do not escalate!
Rules are meant to be broken!

00:40:44.329 --> 00:40:45.765
That's the exact opposite

00:40:45.809 --> 00:40:47.158
of what they're meant for!

00:40:48.203 --> 00:40:50.161
Fuck! Fine!

00:40:50.205 --> 00:40:51.815
I'll start from the beginning.

00:40:51.858 --> 00:40:54.209
My name is Deadpool,
and I'm an X-Man.

00:40:54.252 --> 00:40:56.211
Trainee! Shut it!

00:40:57.168 --> 00:40:59.431
Look, I get it.

00:41:00.606 --> 00:41:02.217
All right, you're scared.

00:41:02.782 --> 00:41:03.870
Alone.

00:41:03.914 --> 00:41:05.002
You got no family.

00:41:05.045 --> 00:41:06.110
I didn't have
a family, either.

00:41:06.134 --> 00:41:07.874
You live in this dump.
Guess what?

00:41:07.918 --> 00:41:09.615
I used to live in a shithole
just like it.

00:41:10.529 --> 00:41:11.878
But you know something?

00:41:11.922 --> 00:41:13.663
A wise woman
once said to me...

00:41:13.706 --> 00:41:15.186
"Speak up."

00:41:15.230 --> 00:41:18.058
"I can't hear you with that
pity dick in your mouth."

00:41:18.102 --> 00:41:19.712
Too much? I went too far.

00:41:27.677 --> 00:41:29.200
That was effervescent.

00:41:29.244 --> 00:41:31.507
Stay in school, kid.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:33.378
Or don't. I didn't.

00:41:33.422 --> 00:41:35.032
And I'm an X-Man.

00:41:35.075 --> 00:41:36.207
Trainee.

00:41:36.251 --> 00:41:37.600
Fuck it!

00:41:37.643 --> 00:41:39.384
Superhero landing coming up!

00:41:42.996 --> 00:41:44.650
Ah, fuck, fuck, fuck!

00:41:44.694 --> 00:41:46.783
That is so not practical.

00:42:07.282 --> 00:42:09.414
I could get used
to this X-Man shit.

00:42:09.458 --> 00:42:10.609
Trainee!

00:42:10.633 --> 00:42:11.851
Trainee!

00:42:11.895 --> 00:42:13.679
Get a power restraint
on him. Now!

00:42:13.723 --> 00:42:16.943
Calm down, squirt.
It's over. We got ya.

00:42:18.815 --> 00:42:20.338
What's that do?

00:42:20.382 --> 00:42:21.905
Power-dampening collar.

00:42:21.948 --> 00:42:23.254
Shuts down
all mutant abilities.

00:42:23.298 --> 00:42:26.126
You can't get it off.
Unless you've got a grenade.

00:42:26.170 --> 00:42:29.173
Huh. Could've used
one of those in the first act.

00:42:29.217 --> 00:42:30.435
Thank you!

00:42:32.307 --> 00:42:34.526
That was absolutely thrilling.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.789
True heroism in action.

00:42:36.833 --> 00:42:38.487
We are in your debt.

00:42:39.314 --> 00:42:40.967
We can take it from here.

00:42:41.011 --> 00:42:43.231
Take me
to the Ice Box, please!

00:42:43.274 --> 00:42:44.449
Anywhere's better than here.

00:42:44.493 --> 00:42:45.755
Believe me, son,

00:42:45.798 --> 00:42:47.539
you do not wanna go
to the Ice Box.

00:42:47.583 --> 00:42:50.194
That place makes Hitler's anus
look like Waikiki.

00:42:50.238 --> 00:42:52.109
Let's get you inside,
young man.

00:42:52.152 --> 00:42:54.154
No, wait, wait. Wait.

00:42:54.198 --> 00:42:55.678
You guys stay there.

00:43:05.775 --> 00:43:07.385
Those guys hurt you?

00:43:08.821 --> 00:43:09.866
Who?

00:43:11.911 --> 00:43:14.610
Baldilocks? Jared Kushner?

00:43:16.089 --> 00:43:17.569
Both of 'em?

00:43:21.312 --> 00:43:23.009
Oh, fuck it.

00:43:23.053 --> 00:43:24.620
Four or five moments!

00:43:24.663 --> 00:43:25.708
I'm sorry?

00:43:25.751 --> 00:43:28.928
Four or five moments!

00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:32.932
That's all it takes
to be a hero.

00:43:33.977 --> 00:43:36.284
People think
you wake up a hero...

00:43:36.327 --> 00:43:38.460
brush your teeth a hero...

00:43:38.503 --> 00:43:41.419
ejaculate into
a soap dispenser a hero.

00:43:42.855 --> 00:43:46.555
But, no, being a hero
takes only a few moments!

00:43:47.904 --> 00:43:49.558
A few moments...

00:43:49.601 --> 00:43:52.300
doing the ugly stuff
no one else will do.

00:43:55.781 --> 00:43:56.913
No!

00:43:59.568 --> 00:44:00.849
Stand down!
Hold your fire!

00:44:00.873 --> 00:44:03.223
Wade, what did you do? Colossus, no!

00:44:03.267 --> 00:44:06.531
You were right, Wade.
You are not X-Men material.

00:44:06.575 --> 00:44:08.881
No shit, Shiny Gandhi!

00:44:08.925 --> 00:44:10.405
What was your first clue?

00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:13.582
The hollow point
through that fuckhead's face?

00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:14.931
That kid was abused!

00:44:14.974 --> 00:44:17.020
- You can always tell!
- We have rules!

00:44:17.063 --> 00:44:19.805
You are not judge,
jury or executioner!

00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:22.808
Fuck your rules!
I fight for what's right!

00:44:22.852 --> 00:44:24.680
And sometimes
you gotta fight dirty!

00:44:24.723 --> 00:44:27.770
You let me down
for the last time, Wade.

00:44:30.903 --> 00:44:33.210
Okay,
get these guys in the pod.

00:44:33.253 --> 00:44:35.430
Take them to the Ice Box.

00:44:56.059 --> 00:44:57.060
Hey, baby!

00:44:58.148 --> 00:45:00.411
I wonder what gang
I'll be in.

00:45:00.455 --> 00:45:01.934
Yeah!

00:45:01.978 --> 00:45:04.241
- Is there, like, a Sorting Hat?
- Hi.

00:45:06.112 --> 00:45:07.505
I've always seen myself as

00:45:07.549 --> 00:45:08.941
more of
an East Coast Hufflepuff.

00:45:10.465 --> 00:45:13.424
I've made a critical error
on my Airbnb reservation.

00:45:13.468 --> 00:45:17.341
This is not what the website
looked like at all.

00:45:18.908 --> 00:45:20.649
I love the decor though.

00:45:20.692 --> 00:45:22.651
I had no idea
hopeless was a color.

00:45:22.694 --> 00:45:23.956
Hard left, douchebag.

00:45:28.483 --> 00:45:29.701
Please, after you.

00:45:31.834 --> 00:45:34.532
Another disgusting minority
off the streets.

00:45:34.576 --> 00:45:35.707
We'll sleep well tonight.

00:45:35.751 --> 00:45:36.795
Let's get a bagel.

00:45:40.059 --> 00:45:42.888
Nighty-night,
you annoying prick!

00:46:18.663 --> 00:46:20.554
You're a long way
from your superpowers.

00:46:20.578 --> 00:46:23.015
Yeah. Just a touch of cancer.

00:46:23.059 --> 00:46:25.540
Not to worry,
we're old friends.

00:46:25.583 --> 00:46:26.802
Fuck!

00:46:26.845 --> 00:46:29.021
I wanted to be a superhero.

00:46:29.065 --> 00:46:31.023
Always wanted
a real super suit.

00:46:31.067 --> 00:46:32.634
What happened?

00:46:32.677 --> 00:46:34.797
When was the last time you saw
a plus-sized superhero?

00:46:35.463 --> 00:46:36.942
Never.

00:46:36.986 --> 00:46:38.770
The industry discriminates.

00:46:39.858 --> 00:46:41.947
Fuck superheroes.

00:46:41.991 --> 00:46:44.254
The thing that
pisses me off the most...

00:46:44.297 --> 00:46:46.125
I never stood up
for myself in there.

00:46:47.736 --> 00:46:50.652
My whole life.

00:46:50.695 --> 00:46:54.177
I've been waiting for someone
to come and save me.

00:46:56.571 --> 00:46:59.530
Nobody's gonna sacrifice
anything for me.

00:47:03.665 --> 00:47:05.928
I gotta start taking care
of myself.

00:47:07.277 --> 00:47:10.019
I have a mission now.

00:47:10.062 --> 00:47:12.717
The first thing I wanna do
when I get out of here...

00:47:12.761 --> 00:47:15.111
burn the headmaster alive...

00:47:15.154 --> 00:47:18.854
and then take a selfie
with his smoldering corpse.

00:47:18.897 --> 00:47:21.334
Aw. That's, like,
my favorite part of the Bible.

00:47:23.075 --> 00:47:25.556
I don't have
a sock puppet on me...

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:27.645
but what did he do to you?

00:47:27.689 --> 00:47:29.299
Did he taste the rainbow?

00:47:29.342 --> 00:47:31.388
I'd whisper it,
but Skittles would sue us.

00:47:32.563 --> 00:47:34.565
Fucker hates mutants.

00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:36.567
He tried to beat
the genes out of us.

00:47:36.611 --> 00:47:39.135
Nothing worse than
a "pray the gay away" type guy.

00:47:39.918 --> 00:47:41.311
Sick piece of shit.

00:47:42.704 --> 00:47:46.403
Tomorrow, we'll find
the biggest guy in here...

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.058
and we'll make him our bitch!

00:47:52.975 --> 00:47:54.324
What was that?

00:47:54.367 --> 00:47:56.935
That is the biggest guy
in here.

00:47:56.979 --> 00:47:59.068
Fun fact about the Ice Box...

00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:00.939
though no one's ever seen it,

00:48:00.983 --> 00:48:03.202
they keep a monster
in the basement.

00:48:03.246 --> 00:48:04.987
Right next to a huge,

00:48:05.030 --> 00:48:06.554
steaming bowl
of foreshadowing.

00:48:07.206 --> 00:48:08.207
Look.

00:48:09.208 --> 00:48:11.471
I can't protect you.

00:48:11.515 --> 00:48:12.647
With this collar on,

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:15.824
my superpower
is just unbridled cancer.

00:48:15.867 --> 00:48:19.349
Give me a bow and arrow,
I'm basically Hawkeye.

00:48:19.392 --> 00:48:21.481
Now, if you'll excuse me...

00:48:21.525 --> 00:48:24.702
I've got tumors to grow.
Vanessa awaits.

00:48:24.746 --> 00:48:27.226
I'll start by making us
a shank.

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:29.185
Good listening. I stole that guard's pen...

00:48:29.228 --> 00:48:31.187
and stashed it
in the old prison wallet,

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:32.623
if you know what I'm saying.

00:48:32.667 --> 00:48:35.147
I really hope I don't know
what you're saying.

00:48:37.236 --> 00:48:39.587
I know it's in there,
I just need to get it out.

00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:41.719
Oh, Jesus Christ.

00:48:41.763 --> 00:48:44.417
I can hear you
rummaging around in there.

00:48:44.461 --> 00:48:46.855
Do they make Purell
for your ears?

00:48:51.381 --> 00:48:52.741
And to update you

00:48:52.774 --> 00:48:54.166
on the story reported earlier,

00:48:54.210 --> 00:48:55.907
after a lengthy standoff

00:48:55.951 --> 00:48:58.562
outside the Essex House
for Mutant Rehabilitation...

00:48:58.606 --> 00:48:59.911
two mutants were arrested

00:48:59.955 --> 00:49:01.696
and transported
to the Ice Box...

00:49:01.739 --> 00:49:03.219
Entering repair mode.

00:49:07.571 --> 00:49:09.157
...several
police cars were destroyed

00:49:09.181 --> 00:49:11.009
and the X-Men were called in
to restore order.

00:49:32.248 --> 00:49:34.250
Cells seven and nine

00:49:34.293 --> 00:49:37.688
now off-limits
for medical personnel.

00:49:37.732 --> 00:49:39.211
Cells seven and nine

00:49:39.255 --> 00:49:41.997
now off-limits
for medical personnel.

00:49:43.738 --> 00:49:45.130
Psst!

00:49:47.437 --> 00:49:49.787
Don't do that.

00:49:49.831 --> 00:49:52.703
What? Why are you
winking at me?

00:49:56.315 --> 00:49:57.708
I got your back.

00:49:57.752 --> 00:49:58.970
Oh, my God.

00:49:59.014 --> 00:50:00.537
You're sick,
I gotta protect you.

00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:02.495
Just leave me alone, kid.

00:50:03.627 --> 00:50:04.672
Oh, great.

00:50:06.543 --> 00:50:09.067
Well, hello there, new fish.

00:50:09.111 --> 00:50:12.157
It's nice to see some
fresh faces around here.

00:50:12.201 --> 00:50:14.464
I've done some
light catalog work...

00:50:14.507 --> 00:50:16.988
but, really, modeling is just
a stepping stone to acting.

00:50:17.032 --> 00:50:19.817
I was talking to him.Oh.

00:50:19.861 --> 00:50:23.255
Have we met?
I can't place your mustache.

00:50:23.299 --> 00:50:25.954
Black Tom Cassidy. White Wade Wilson.

00:50:25.997 --> 00:50:29.435
What's your superpower?
Cultural appropriation?

00:50:29.479 --> 00:50:32.047
You're supposed to be
the toughest cunt in here.

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.658
You don't look
like much to me.

00:50:34.702 --> 00:50:37.139
First rule of the yard,
fuckface...

00:50:37.182 --> 00:50:39.228
find the biggest guy
and make him your...

00:50:43.058 --> 00:50:45.277
Second biggest guy.

00:50:45.321 --> 00:50:47.758
The last thing I need
is more hepatitis.

00:50:47.802 --> 00:50:51.370
Oh, it's slippery, too.
This table needs a wipe down!

00:50:51.414 --> 00:50:53.242
Can we get a wipe down
on the table?

00:50:54.547 --> 00:50:56.767
Kid, I think you picked
the wrong side.

00:50:56.811 --> 00:50:59.161
No, I didn't!
He's my friend!

00:50:59.204 --> 00:51:01.467
Zip it. We're not friends.

00:51:03.165 --> 00:51:04.445
You're about to get
dick-slapped.

00:51:16.831 --> 00:51:18.571
I had so much fun!
You were like...

00:51:18.615 --> 00:51:20.704
And I was like,
"Take a seat, shit dick."

00:51:20.748 --> 00:51:22.488
Just let me die in peace.

00:51:22.532 --> 00:51:24.664
We make a great team!

00:51:24.708 --> 00:51:27.276
Oh, God! We're not a team.

00:51:27.319 --> 00:51:31.671
Why'd you say that back there?
We're friends, partners.

00:51:31.715 --> 00:51:34.109
We're not partners
or friends.

00:51:35.545 --> 00:51:37.634
This doesn't end with us
riding into the sunset.

00:51:37.677 --> 00:51:39.854
It ends with me
dying of cancer...

00:51:39.897 --> 00:51:43.771
and you winning the Ice Box
award for softest mouth.

00:51:45.207 --> 00:51:46.817
There's only one person
in this world

00:51:46.861 --> 00:51:48.645
that I care about,
and she's gone.

00:51:50.429 --> 00:51:53.606
You wanna survive?

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:56.958
Stop trying to shank
the biggest guys in here...

00:51:57.001 --> 00:51:58.873
and make friends with them.

00:52:00.178 --> 00:52:01.789
Make friends with someone.

00:52:03.007 --> 00:52:04.617
Anyone but me.

00:52:05.793 --> 00:52:08.099
Maybe even Black Tim.

00:52:09.013 --> 00:52:10.623
Black Evan, I don't know.

00:52:10.667 --> 00:52:13.148
All I remember is
he was African-American.

00:52:58.628 --> 00:53:00.717
System malfunctioning.

00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.112
Cells 7, 12, 14, 27.

00:53:04.155 --> 00:53:06.418
Back in your cells, you filthy
mutants! Get in there!

00:53:06.462 --> 00:53:09.769
Cells 1, 3, 7, 8.

00:53:10.945 --> 00:53:12.385
Searching.

00:53:13.904 --> 00:53:16.254
Cell 04 located.

00:53:17.647 --> 00:53:19.779
Door won't open!

00:53:19.823 --> 00:53:21.433
On your fucking knees!

00:53:58.383 --> 00:54:00.081
That was our cell.

00:54:02.213 --> 00:54:04.520
What did I do to piss off
a grumpy old fucker

00:54:04.563 --> 00:54:05.738
with a Winter Soldier arm?

00:54:15.009 --> 00:54:16.924
Get away from me, kid!

00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:25.758
Listen to me! Go!

00:54:31.242 --> 00:54:32.548
Hello, Russell.

00:56:16.130 --> 00:56:17.131
Who are you?

00:56:18.045 --> 00:56:19.263
I'm Batman.

00:56:30.709 --> 00:56:31.754
Ooh!

00:56:36.498 --> 00:56:39.370
Oh. That's got some zip.

00:56:47.900 --> 00:56:50.686
Don't feel bad.
Even I can't kill me.

00:56:51.382 --> 00:56:52.949
Talk!

00:56:52.992 --> 00:56:54.777
What kind of
spineless shit stick

00:56:54.820 --> 00:56:56.170
tries to kill
a 14-year-old boy?

00:56:57.475 --> 00:56:58.998
You might wanna start talking!

00:56:59.042 --> 00:57:01.282
'Cause I got a long history of
firing at times like this!

00:57:02.654 --> 00:57:04.656
The name's Cable.

00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:07.355
I'm from the future.
Just walk away.

00:57:08.051 --> 00:57:09.357
Oh!

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.359
So, you're from the future.

00:57:11.402 --> 00:57:13.361
I have
three questions then.

00:57:13.404 --> 00:57:17.016
One, is dubstep still a thing?

00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:19.541
Two, do people still homebrew?

00:57:19.584 --> 00:57:22.152
And three,
does Dopinder ever find love?

00:58:06.327 --> 00:58:08.111
Dubstep's for pussies.

00:58:08.155 --> 00:58:09.460
You're so dark!

00:58:09.504 --> 00:58:11.593
Are you sure you're not
from the DC universe?

00:58:12.333 --> 00:58:13.899
I love dubstep!

00:58:40.187 --> 00:58:41.623
Is that a fanny pack?

00:58:41.666 --> 00:58:44.234
I used to have one of those
in 1990-never.

00:58:45.235 --> 00:58:47.324
Something to remember you by.

00:58:47.368 --> 00:58:51.154
Give me that back!
That goes with me everywhere.

00:58:51.198 --> 00:58:53.548
Like the memory
of your fucking fanny pack!

00:59:03.297 --> 00:59:05.386
Why are you protecting
the kid?

00:59:06.691 --> 00:59:08.998
I don't give a fuck
about him...

00:59:09.041 --> 00:59:11.435
and his Are You My Mother?
complex!

00:59:13.785 --> 00:59:15.047
What's this one do?

00:59:29.236 --> 00:59:30.846
In every film,
there's a moment

00:59:30.889 --> 00:59:33.283
when the hero
hits rock bottom.

00:59:33.327 --> 00:59:35.285
InCool Runnings,
it was when John Candy's

00:59:35.329 --> 00:59:37.287
prized bobsled broke.

00:59:37.331 --> 00:59:40.072
InHuman Centipede,
it was when those people...

00:59:40.116 --> 00:59:41.683
signed on to be in that movie.

00:59:41.726 --> 00:59:43.859
But in this film, well...

00:59:43.902 --> 00:59:45.121
you're looking at it.

00:59:45.164 --> 00:59:46.905
On your fucking knees, mutant.

00:59:49.821 --> 00:59:50.822
Rock...

00:59:54.870 --> 00:59:56.350
meet bottom.

01:00:07.056 --> 01:00:08.207
I love you, Wade Wilson.

01:00:08.231 --> 01:00:09.406
Ness?

01:00:10.451 --> 01:00:11.930
Hey, Ness!

01:00:12.801 --> 01:00:14.629
Ness, can you let me in?

01:00:14.672 --> 01:00:16.761
Please! Please.

01:00:18.937 --> 01:00:20.069
Jesus.

01:00:22.985 --> 01:00:24.745
You're not giving me
a lot of direction here.

01:00:24.769 --> 01:00:26.597
I'm at the end of my rope.

01:00:29.078 --> 01:00:31.428
Then I joined the X-Men.

01:00:31.472 --> 01:00:33.300
I went to prison. I, uh...

01:00:37.391 --> 01:00:38.914
Is it the kid?

01:00:40.959 --> 01:00:43.875
Kids give us a chance to be
better than we used to be.

01:00:45.312 --> 01:00:46.313
The kid!

01:00:59.935 --> 01:01:01.545
That's exactly what she meant.

01:01:01.589 --> 01:01:03.001
Your heart needs to be
in the right place.

01:01:03.025 --> 01:01:04.896
I'm not gonna
abandon this kid.

01:01:04.940 --> 01:01:07.551
He's never had anyone, ever.

01:01:07.595 --> 01:01:08.944
I need to be selfless.

01:01:08.987 --> 01:01:10.946
Yeah, but what does
that mean?

01:01:10.989 --> 01:01:14.253
It means
I'm gonna save Russell.

01:01:14.297 --> 01:01:15.820
Maybe I couldn't
save Vanessa...

01:01:15.864 --> 01:01:18.867
but maybe I can save a robust
teenager from New Zealand.

01:01:18.910 --> 01:01:20.975
Yeah, but what I mean is,
like, the world "selfless."

01:01:20.999 --> 01:01:22.523
I literally don't know
what that means.

01:01:22.566 --> 01:01:23.741
Jesus Christ.

01:01:23.785 --> 01:01:26.527
Okay, look.
According to my guy, okay...

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:28.398
those muties
are being transferred

01:01:28.442 --> 01:01:30.269
to a supermax, 80 miles away.

01:01:30.313 --> 01:01:32.141
Great, I'll pick 'em off
along the way.

01:01:32.184 --> 01:01:34.361
Hold your testicles there,
buddy, okay?

01:01:34.404 --> 01:01:36.406
We're talking about
an armored convoy...

01:01:36.450 --> 01:01:39.061
and a vicious super soldier
from the future...

01:01:39.104 --> 01:01:41.455
that is looking to turn your
skull into a fuckable ashtray.

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:42.978
You know what we need to do?

01:01:43.021 --> 01:01:44.893
We need to build
a fucking team.

01:01:44.936 --> 01:01:47.025
We need 'em tough,
morally flexible...

01:01:47.069 --> 01:01:48.462
and young enough
so they can carry

01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:49.700
this franchise 10 to 12 years.

01:01:49.724 --> 01:01:51.595
A team of
highly-skilled motherfuckers.

01:01:51.639 --> 01:01:54.685
I'm talking about some
Ocean's 14shit. Rogue Two.

01:01:54.729 --> 01:01:57.166
John Wick 3,but with
the original director.

01:01:57.209 --> 01:01:59.124
My body is an
instrument of death.

01:01:59.168 --> 01:02:00.517
Not now, Dopinder.

01:02:00.561 --> 01:02:02.040
I could be of great use.

01:02:02.084 --> 01:02:03.651
What's your superpower?

01:02:05.479 --> 01:02:07.132
Courage. That's adorable.

01:02:07.176 --> 01:02:08.849
Do you have the courage
to check and see...

01:02:08.873 --> 01:02:11.267
if there are enough sanitary
napkins in the dispenser?

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:12.355
Yes, sir.

01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:13.661
I'm sorry
you had to see that,

01:02:13.704 --> 01:02:16.054
although I'm glad
you heard it.

01:02:16.098 --> 01:02:18.013
All right, I'll put out
a call for resumes.

01:02:18.056 --> 01:02:20.319
But we're not paying
medical or dental.

01:02:20.363 --> 01:02:22.409
It's time to get back
on LinkedIn.

01:02:59.271 --> 01:03:00.925
Attention, all inmates!

01:03:00.969 --> 01:03:03.406
Transport to Cross Force
Maximum Security

01:03:03.450 --> 01:03:04.929
Mutant Containment Facility...

01:03:04.973 --> 01:03:06.931
will begin at 0800 hours.

01:03:06.975 --> 01:03:08.977
Inspection of your cells
and out processing

01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:11.066
will begin at 0600.

01:03:19.378 --> 01:03:20.467
Oi.

01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:21.859
What the fuck
do you want?

01:03:21.903 --> 01:03:23.731
That's my fucking pudding.

01:03:23.774 --> 01:03:25.776
Fuck your pudding! You like pudding?

01:03:46.797 --> 01:03:47.798
Hello?

01:03:50.105 --> 01:03:52.455
I know you're in there.

01:04:08.123 --> 01:04:10.429
Must be hard
being the biggest guy in here.

01:04:11.692 --> 01:04:13.998
Lonely at the top, eh?

01:04:14.042 --> 01:04:16.000
They're moving us tomorrow.

01:04:18.481 --> 01:04:20.265
Maybe I can get you
out of here.

01:04:21.484 --> 01:04:24.618
And we can make
the whole world our bitch.

01:04:26.489 --> 01:04:28.230
We need a secret code.

01:04:31.450 --> 01:04:33.888
No,
that's stupid, Russell. Idiot.

01:04:41.156 --> 01:04:42.679
We're a team.

01:04:42.723 --> 01:04:44.681
We're like thugs,
we're like gangsters.

01:04:44.725 --> 01:04:48.380
I'm like Tupac,
and you're like Ice Cube.

01:04:48.424 --> 01:04:49.532
Supposedly,
she can rap, too.

01:04:49.556 --> 01:04:50.644
Yeah.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:51.732
I like that.

01:04:51.775 --> 01:04:53.429
Terrific,
these are all terrific.

01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:55.213
Meet Bedlam.

01:04:55.257 --> 01:04:57.520
Cool name! Superpowers?

01:04:57.564 --> 01:04:59.087
I can distort
electrical fields.

01:05:00.305 --> 01:05:02.525
Including the one
inside your brain...

01:05:02.569 --> 01:05:05.267
causing anxiety, confusion...

01:05:05.310 --> 01:05:07.312
pain.

01:05:07.356 --> 01:05:09.445
So, basically,
you're Dave Matthews.

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:10.620
We can use him.

01:05:12.404 --> 01:05:14.058
I'm Zeitgeist.

01:05:14.102 --> 01:05:15.407
Cool. I like it.

01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:16.713
So you have the power

01:05:16.757 --> 01:05:19.107
to put your finger
on the pulse of society?

01:05:20.151 --> 01:05:21.326
No.

01:05:21.370 --> 01:05:22.937
No, I spit acidic vomit.

01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:24.112
Oh.Do you want me

01:05:24.155 --> 01:05:25.548
to demonstrate? DEADPOOL: No!

01:05:25.592 --> 01:05:27.071
We'll take
your word for it.

01:05:27.115 --> 01:05:29.267
Thank you. Yeah. Listen,
we've all eaten at Arby's, okay?

01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:31.902
And this is the Vanisher.

01:05:35.253 --> 01:05:36.254
But...

01:05:37.429 --> 01:05:38.909
Vanisher!

01:05:41.433 --> 01:05:43.087
Nice! Right?

01:05:44.393 --> 01:05:45.524
He's not here, is he?

01:05:45.568 --> 01:05:47.091
He may be running late.

01:05:48.702 --> 01:05:51.530
My name's Rusty,
but I go by Shatterstar.

01:05:51.574 --> 01:05:52.793
That's good, yeah.

01:05:52.836 --> 01:05:54.969
"Rusty" is terrible.Toughie.

01:05:55.012 --> 01:05:57.841
So, uh, where are you from?
The planet Mojo World.

01:05:57.885 --> 01:05:59.930
So you're an alien, I guess. Bad name.

01:05:59.974 --> 01:06:01.671
How does that, uh, help us?

01:06:01.715 --> 01:06:04.631
I'm basically better
than you at everything.

01:06:04.674 --> 01:06:06.391
Just once, I'm gonna find
a planet of people

01:06:06.415 --> 01:06:07.982
that are worse than me
at everything.

01:06:08.025 --> 01:06:10.245
A whole bunch
of functional idiots.

01:06:10.288 --> 01:06:12.223
I'm gonna go there, and I'm
gonna be their Superman.

01:06:12.247 --> 01:06:13.378
Isn't that Canada?

01:06:13.422 --> 01:06:15.816
You shut your
goddamn trash mouth!

01:06:16.991 --> 01:06:18.514
Meet... Domino.

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:20.603
What's your shtick? I'm lucky.

01:06:20.647 --> 01:06:22.039
That's not a superpower.

01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:23.214
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.

01:06:23.258 --> 01:06:24.520
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

01:06:24.563 --> 01:06:25.608
Yeah, it is. No, it isn't.

01:06:25.652 --> 01:06:26.696
Yes, it is. No, it isn't.

01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:27.760
Yeah, it is. Really isn't.

01:06:27.784 --> 01:06:29.003
No, it isn't.Yes, it is.

01:06:29.046 --> 01:06:30.221
Told you.

01:06:30.265 --> 01:06:31.614
Get out of my head!

01:06:31.658 --> 01:06:33.268
I'm not in your head.

01:06:33.311 --> 01:06:34.661
I'm in an
11-year-old's bedroom.

01:06:34.704 --> 01:06:35.836
Well, if you're so lucky,

01:06:35.879 --> 01:06:37.489
then what are you
doing here with us?

01:06:37.533 --> 01:06:38.665
I don't know yet.

01:06:38.708 --> 01:06:40.231
What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:40.275 --> 01:06:41.556
There's a reason why I'm here,
and I'll know when I know.

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.384
Everything usually
just kind of works out for me.

01:06:43.408 --> 01:06:45.236
Like 2008 Ryan Reynolds.

01:06:46.542 --> 01:06:47.674
I don't know who that is.

01:06:47.717 --> 01:06:49.197
You're hired.

01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.285
Lucky me.

01:06:50.328 --> 01:06:51.547
I like her!

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:53.984
And last, but not least...

01:06:54.028 --> 01:06:55.159
Peter.

01:06:56.552 --> 01:06:59.076
Am I getting
catfished here or...?

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.035
Any powers you wanna
tell us about?

01:07:01.078 --> 01:07:02.689
No.

01:07:02.732 --> 01:07:04.429
I don't have one.

01:07:04.473 --> 01:07:05.779
Um, I just saw the ad.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:07.606
No superpowers at all?

01:07:07.650 --> 01:07:10.740
Uh, I have both
Type 1 and 2 Diabetes.

01:07:11.262 --> 01:07:12.611
Ow! Oh!

01:07:12.655 --> 01:07:13.787
That's all the diabetes.

01:07:13.830 --> 01:07:15.136
Right?
Yeah, you got 'em all.

01:07:15.179 --> 01:07:17.094
If you find a Type 3,
let us know.

01:07:17.616 --> 01:07:18.661
Yeah.

01:07:18.705 --> 01:07:19.793
You're in.

01:07:19.836 --> 01:07:21.359
Yeah. Fuck!

01:07:23.753 --> 01:07:25.146
It's fulfilling work.

01:07:30.238 --> 01:07:31.543
Let's go!

01:07:45.166 --> 01:07:47.777
This is Convoy 17
departing the Ice Box.

01:07:47.821 --> 01:07:49.170
We are en route.

01:07:56.786 --> 01:07:59.136
Peacetime makes people soft.

01:08:00.747 --> 01:08:02.531
I was born into war.

01:08:04.054 --> 01:08:05.229
Bred into it.

01:08:06.361 --> 01:08:08.145
Okay.

01:08:08.189 --> 01:08:10.539
What's the most pain
you've ever felt?

01:08:12.497 --> 01:08:13.760
These restraints are pretty...

01:08:13.803 --> 01:08:15.674
People think
they understand pain.

01:08:15.718 --> 01:08:17.154
They have no concept of it

01:08:17.198 --> 01:08:19.156
beyond their own
worst experience.

01:08:20.767 --> 01:08:23.944
5 years old. That's what?

01:08:23.987 --> 01:08:25.554
A bee sting.

01:08:25.597 --> 01:08:26.729
Oh, yeah.

01:08:26.773 --> 01:08:29.297
20 years old, shrapnel.

01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:32.039
40 years old, disease.

01:08:32.082 --> 01:08:36.652
Maybe the kind that leaves you
more machine than man.

01:08:36.695 --> 01:08:38.095
Yeah, getting old's
not for sissies.

01:08:38.132 --> 01:08:39.786
That's what my
Grandma Ginny used to...

01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:41.004
I've got a list.

01:08:41.788 --> 01:08:43.746
We're gonna work down it.

01:08:44.442 --> 01:08:45.443
Together.

01:08:46.618 --> 01:08:49.665
Number one,
I'm gonna bend something.

01:08:49.708 --> 01:08:52.015
Something that was not
meant to bend.

01:08:52.059 --> 01:08:53.210
I'm gonna
stop you right there

01:08:53.234 --> 01:08:54.559
because I'm not gonna
make it to two.

01:08:54.583 --> 01:08:55.889
I won't even
make it to one.

01:08:55.932 --> 01:08:57.673
I don't do well with pain,
you know.

01:08:57.716 --> 01:09:00.067
If I stub my toe,
I'm done for the day.

01:09:00.110 --> 01:09:02.504
I cried when they
canceled Felicity.

01:09:02.547 --> 01:09:04.395
When I get really scared,
I get nervous erections.

01:09:04.419 --> 01:09:05.812
I have one right now.

01:09:05.855 --> 01:09:07.422
Don't look.
It'll only make it worse.

01:09:07.465 --> 01:09:08.597
I don't want you
to hurt me,

01:09:08.640 --> 01:09:10.817
and I'll tell you
anything you wanna know.

01:09:11.818 --> 01:09:13.950
Except for where they are.

01:09:13.994 --> 01:09:15.275
Russell's in a convoy
heading southbound

01:09:15.299 --> 01:09:16.692
on Gerry Duggan Parkway.

01:09:16.735 --> 01:09:18.061
The monster's with them.
I wouldn't fuck with him.

01:09:18.085 --> 01:09:19.564
You all know the plan.

01:09:19.608 --> 01:09:21.349
Intercept the convoy,

01:09:21.392 --> 01:09:23.394
grab the boy.
But not inappropriately!

01:09:23.438 --> 01:09:24.787
You know what,

01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:26.354
I wouldn't fuck with
Deadpool either.

01:09:26.397 --> 01:09:28.530
Because he's built a team.
He's unstoppable.

01:09:28.573 --> 01:09:31.272
He has an ass pen.
He'll stab you with it.

01:09:31.315 --> 01:09:33.927
Watch out for this guy, Cable!

01:09:33.970 --> 01:09:37.234
He's very short, 5'11".
Not like in the comics.

01:09:37.278 --> 01:09:40.368
And if we succeed,
we all go home early.

01:09:40.411 --> 01:09:42.491
So if you go after
them, Cable, I warn you...

01:09:43.284 --> 01:09:44.981
there's a wind advisory
in effect.

01:09:56.123 --> 01:09:57.763
A little turbulent up here.

01:10:05.132 --> 01:10:06.916
I don't know much
about this Cable fella...

01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.352
but I guarantee
he hasn't killed

01:10:08.396 --> 01:10:10.137
as many people
as melanoma has.

01:10:11.529 --> 01:10:12.922
We're getting close!

01:10:12.966 --> 01:10:14.663
As a former X-Man...

01:10:14.706 --> 01:10:16.621
Trainee. Thank you, Bedlam.

01:10:16.665 --> 01:10:19.015
I was always appalled
by the blatant sexism

01:10:19.059 --> 01:10:20.669
in the group's name.

01:10:20.712 --> 01:10:22.758
X-Men! Men!

01:10:22.801 --> 01:10:25.804
The point is, our group
will be forward thinking.

01:10:25.848 --> 01:10:27.154
Gender neutral.

01:10:27.197 --> 01:10:29.504
From now on,
we'll be known as...

01:10:31.767 --> 01:10:33.116
X-Force.

01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:34.944
Isn't that
a little derivative?

01:10:34.988 --> 01:10:37.381
I don't recall asking
your opinion, Peter!

01:10:38.643 --> 01:10:40.080
That wasn't me.

01:10:47.130 --> 01:10:49.480
Hang the laundry out
at 1,300 feet...

01:10:49.524 --> 01:10:51.352
intercept the convoy,
and grab the boy.

01:10:51.395 --> 01:10:52.503
Let's bring on
the carnage, baby!

01:10:52.527 --> 01:10:54.398
Get me on the ground,
watch me go!

01:10:54.442 --> 01:10:55.573
Yeah!

01:10:55.617 --> 01:10:57.314
I can't wait to kill!

01:10:57.358 --> 01:11:00.100
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:11:00.143 --> 01:11:02.841
I just wanna say
how proud I am of this team.

01:11:02.885 --> 01:11:05.757
You know,
you guys look amazing!

01:11:05.801 --> 01:11:08.673
Vanisher, I have no doubt
you look amazing too.

01:11:08.717 --> 01:11:09.848
This is the family

01:11:09.892 --> 01:11:11.572
that I've always dreamed
of having and I...

01:11:12.329 --> 01:11:13.417
Ah, shit.

01:11:15.028 --> 01:11:16.725
I just get a little choked up
sometimes.

01:11:16.768 --> 01:11:18.596
I hate to interrupt,
but is anybody nervous

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.989
about the high winds?

01:11:20.033 --> 01:11:21.382
Gary. My name's Peter.

01:11:21.425 --> 01:11:23.340
I realize that you're
new to this, but relax.

01:11:23.384 --> 01:11:25.038
You've been chosen
by a higher power.

01:11:25.081 --> 01:11:27.388
Did he just call himself God?
I think he did.

01:11:27.431 --> 01:11:28.998
I'd like to go home. And I'd like...

01:11:29.042 --> 01:11:31.566
the McRib to be available
year round,

01:11:31.609 --> 01:11:33.437
but sometimes dreams
don't come true.

01:11:33.481 --> 01:11:35.657
I spent 10 years
in Special Forces.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.851
You think we didn't
jump out of the plane

01:11:36.875 --> 01:11:38.834
because of a light breeze?

01:11:38.877 --> 01:11:41.141
You're in this shit now,
Mustache!

01:11:41.184 --> 01:11:43.162
I'm only yelling
to impress the other guys.

01:11:43.186 --> 01:11:45.493
I'd never let anything
happen to you, Sugarbear.

01:11:45.536 --> 01:11:47.756
Leonard, hit it!

01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:58.506
Go! Go! Go!

01:12:34.194 --> 01:12:35.630
Let's get some!

01:12:35.673 --> 01:12:36.848
Whoo!

01:12:36.892 --> 01:12:38.067
Oh, yeah!

01:12:38.111 --> 01:12:40.939
Convoy, 12 o'clock!
On my command!

01:12:41.984 --> 01:12:43.464
Deploy! Oh, hey now!

01:12:43.507 --> 01:12:44.769
Whoa!

01:12:50.036 --> 01:12:51.950
Little off course here.

01:12:54.127 --> 01:12:56.955
Holy mommy fucking shit!

01:12:57.695 --> 01:12:59.132
Ah, there they are.

01:12:59.175 --> 01:13:02.787
Look at these gorgeous
sons of bitches.

01:13:02.831 --> 01:13:04.746
Oh, yeah!
That's right, Bedlam!

01:13:09.838 --> 01:13:14.103
No! Tripping
motherfucking billies!

01:13:14.147 --> 01:13:17.237
Shatterstar.
Okay, you got this.

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:19.065
Left!

01:13:19.108 --> 01:13:20.457
Left!

01:13:20.501 --> 01:13:22.764
You'd have to be insane
to take off in this.

01:13:22.807 --> 01:13:25.027
No, stage left, you idiot!

01:13:28.944 --> 01:13:30.467
Well, I guess
we found something

01:13:30.511 --> 01:13:31.599
you're not better at.

01:13:33.818 --> 01:13:35.124
Vanisher.

01:13:35.168 --> 01:13:36.952
Maybe the wind can't blow
what it can't see.

01:13:40.086 --> 01:13:41.522
Oh! Really?

01:13:41.565 --> 01:13:43.915
All right,
we could do this with four.

01:13:43.959 --> 01:13:46.962
Sugarbear.
You got this, buddy!

01:13:47.005 --> 01:13:49.095
That's the stuff!
That's the X-Force spirit!

01:13:50.313 --> 01:13:52.402
Never underestimate
a man with a mustache!

01:13:52.446 --> 01:13:54.012
Just ask anyone in Brooklyn.

01:13:54.056 --> 01:13:55.231
We did it!

01:13:55.275 --> 01:13:56.841
You're a goddamn
superhero, you!

01:13:56.885 --> 01:13:57.973
X-Force!

01:13:58.582 --> 01:13:59.670
X-Force.

01:14:04.066 --> 01:14:05.937
Oh!

01:14:09.637 --> 01:14:10.681
Peter.

01:14:10.725 --> 01:14:12.030
I got you, buddy!

01:14:12.074 --> 01:14:13.269
You're gonna be fine!
This is not good, man!

01:14:13.293 --> 01:14:15.599
You got this, big guy!
Here we go, Peter!

01:14:15.643 --> 01:14:17.123
Look at me.
We're X-Force, right?

01:14:17.166 --> 01:14:19.255
Yeah, we're X-Force. We're X-Force.

01:14:23.303 --> 01:14:25.348
Oh, my God!
What the fuck?

01:14:25.392 --> 01:14:27.394
Fucking acidic vomit!

01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:31.746
Oh, God! I'm gonna throw up
in my mask.

01:14:34.836 --> 01:14:37.230
Okay,
I'm over the convoy.

01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:39.710
Where did the rest
of the team land?

01:14:39.754 --> 01:14:41.408
Good news and bad news.

01:14:41.451 --> 01:14:44.585
Bad news is
the whole team is dead.

01:14:44.628 --> 01:14:45.934
The good news is,

01:14:45.977 --> 01:14:47.805
I don't think anyone's
gonna miss Shatterstar.

01:14:47.849 --> 01:14:51.200
He was a bit of a prick.
Oh, but Paul!

01:14:51.244 --> 01:14:52.245
Peter!

01:14:52.288 --> 01:14:53.768
Peter, I'm gonna
miss him most.

01:14:53.811 --> 01:14:54.943
But there is
a slight chance

01:14:54.986 --> 01:14:56.336
Vanisher could make it.

01:14:56.379 --> 01:14:58.990
Nope, no chance. He's dead.

01:14:59.034 --> 01:15:00.209
The whole team?

01:15:00.253 --> 01:15:02.124
Only the main ones.
We're still good.

01:15:02.168 --> 01:15:03.430
Fuck, you are dumb.

01:15:03.473 --> 01:15:05.127
Whoever planned this stunt's

01:15:05.171 --> 01:15:07.347
been smoking
a lot jazz cabbage.

01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:08.522
I'll tell you that much.

01:15:08.565 --> 01:15:10.219
That's pretty obvious!

01:15:10.263 --> 01:15:12.003
Looking good, Vanisher.

01:15:21.839 --> 01:15:23.711
They're headed
into the tunnel.

01:15:24.712 --> 01:15:26.192
I'm that kid's only hope,

01:15:26.235 --> 01:15:28.106
so sit tight
and wait for my word.

01:15:28.846 --> 01:15:30.152
Whatever.

01:15:30.196 --> 01:15:31.719
We're gonna lose 'em.
I'm dropping in.

01:15:31.762 --> 01:15:34.156
Uh, that's
a negative, sole survivor.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:36.724
Luck is not a superpower!
We are so fucked!

01:15:36.767 --> 01:15:39.857
No, we most certainly
are not fucked.

01:15:42.947 --> 01:15:45.602
Seriously,
I don't get it!

01:15:45.646 --> 01:15:48.126
What, you shoot luck lasers
out of your eyes?

01:15:50.303 --> 01:15:52.130
It's just
it's hard to picture.

01:15:52.174 --> 01:15:54.263
And certainly
not very cinematic.

01:15:56.961 --> 01:15:58.572
I mean, luck?

01:15:58.615 --> 01:16:01.183
What coked out,
glass pipe-sucking

01:16:01.227 --> 01:16:02.576
freakshow comic book artist...

01:16:02.619 --> 01:16:04.273
came up
with that little chestnut?

01:16:04.317 --> 01:16:06.580
Probably a guy
who can't draw feet!

01:16:17.678 --> 01:16:20.985
Once again, it all falls
on my shoulders.

01:16:21.029 --> 01:16:22.267
It's why I'm cursed to be
a solo act.

01:16:22.291 --> 01:16:23.312
Wander the Earth... I'm in.

01:16:23.336 --> 01:16:24.859
I'm sorry, what did you say?

01:16:24.902 --> 01:16:26.034
I'm in.

01:16:26.077 --> 01:16:27.949
How in the fuck
are you in already?

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:30.212
Oh, shit.

01:16:30.256 --> 01:16:31.474
It's Cable. 12 o'clock.

01:16:31.518 --> 01:16:32.649
Okay.

01:16:32.693 --> 01:16:35.130
New plan. Use all of your
imaginary powers

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:37.915
to stop Cable
from killing that kid.

01:16:37.959 --> 01:16:39.569
I'm coming up on your six.

01:16:47.838 --> 01:16:49.884
That gun is amazing!

01:16:59.023 --> 01:17:01.069
Hey!
Asshole!

01:17:01.112 --> 01:17:02.723
Where is he?
I can't see him.

01:17:02.766 --> 01:17:04.507
He's on top of you.

01:17:04.551 --> 01:17:06.422
He's tearing you open!

01:17:06.466 --> 01:17:08.381
He's going in
through the back!

01:17:08.424 --> 01:17:09.556
Oh, God, he's inside!

01:17:09.599 --> 01:17:10.905
You hear yourself, right?

01:17:10.948 --> 01:17:12.404
Accidental double entendres!

01:17:12.428 --> 01:17:14.952
Russell! Russell Collins!

01:17:14.996 --> 01:17:16.911
Hands off that kid,
John Connor!

01:17:21.916 --> 01:17:22.917
No, no, no!

01:17:27.269 --> 01:17:28.357
Shit!

01:17:50.336 --> 01:17:52.250
Two can play that game!

01:17:54.383 --> 01:17:56.211
Got it! No, I don't.

01:17:57.212 --> 01:17:58.256
Showtime, mama!

01:17:58.300 --> 01:17:59.910
Lady Luck, take the wheel.

01:18:37.731 --> 01:18:39.535
I'd ask who you are, but
you'll be dead in a second.

01:18:39.559 --> 01:18:41.648
I'm Domino, and doubtful.

01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:59.230
Hang in there, Doms!

01:19:00.536 --> 01:19:02.233
Oh, this is really hard.

01:19:14.507 --> 01:19:15.907
And give me back
my Skee-Ball token.

01:19:19.425 --> 01:19:20.948
You're doing great.X-Force.

01:19:22.906 --> 01:19:24.952
I guess dubstep never dies.

01:19:29.217 --> 01:19:30.261
Whoo!

01:19:37.268 --> 01:19:39.923
You killed Black Tom,
you racist son of a bitch!

01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:43.840
That's unfortunate.

01:19:46.974 --> 01:19:48.366
We got no brakes!

01:19:48.410 --> 01:19:49.629
Figure it out!

01:19:54.024 --> 01:19:55.548
There's nothing I can't kill.

01:19:58.376 --> 01:20:00.901
Well, as Scoutmaster Kevin
used to say...

01:20:00.944 --> 01:20:03.294
"There's a first time
for everything, son."

01:20:04.992 --> 01:20:06.559
Give me your best shot,
One-Eyed Willy.

01:20:21.443 --> 01:20:23.358
Those bullets were, like,
super fast.

01:20:23.924 --> 01:20:24.925
Here we go.

01:20:26.013 --> 01:20:28.276
Domino, mind slowing us down?

01:20:28.319 --> 01:20:30.452
Here goes nothing.

01:21:01.614 --> 01:21:03.354
Knock, knock.

01:21:09.883 --> 01:21:10.927
That's my boy.

01:21:17.325 --> 01:21:18.544
Holy...

01:21:28.771 --> 01:21:30.425
I'll be first to admit...

01:21:30.468 --> 01:21:32.819
this did not go
according to plan.

01:21:34.168 --> 01:21:35.735
I'll also be the first
to admit that

01:21:35.778 --> 01:21:37.650
that plan was
written in crayon.

01:21:37.693 --> 01:21:40.957
Looks like Russell found
a new friend. Jelly.

01:21:41.001 --> 01:21:42.611
Turns out Domino's
a bit of a badass,

01:21:42.655 --> 01:21:45.571
and maybe,
possibly mildly lucky.

01:21:45.614 --> 01:21:48.878
But Cable? Ugh.
That guy's in a mood.

01:21:48.922 --> 01:21:50.140
A mood that is

01:21:50.184 --> 01:21:51.968
about to get
significantly worse.

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:18.168
Something is so terribly,
terribly wrong.

01:22:21.128 --> 01:22:22.608
Oh.

01:22:24.392 --> 01:22:26.046
Oh, God, that hurt.

01:22:26.089 --> 01:22:27.700
Suck it, Mel Gibson.

01:22:31.268 --> 01:22:32.356
Russell.

01:22:35.055 --> 01:22:36.143
Russell!

01:22:36.752 --> 01:22:38.841
Russ, where are ya?

01:22:42.497 --> 01:22:44.673
Russell. Russell, you're okay!

01:22:44.717 --> 01:22:48.155
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God!

01:22:48.198 --> 01:22:49.547
Juggernaut!

01:22:50.723 --> 01:22:52.768
I thought that was you!

01:22:52.812 --> 01:22:55.641
I should've worn
my white pants.

01:22:55.684 --> 01:22:59.514
You probably get this a lot,
but I am a huge fan.

01:22:59.557 --> 01:23:02.865
Uncanny X-Men183. Thor411.

01:23:02.909 --> 01:23:04.258
X-Men Unlimited12.

01:23:04.301 --> 01:23:06.434
You know, it has always been
a dream of mine...

01:23:06.477 --> 01:23:08.262
to see my face
reflected in your helmet...

01:23:08.305 --> 01:23:10.525
as you charge at me
with murderous intent.

01:23:10.568 --> 01:23:12.353
I don't mean right now.

01:23:12.396 --> 01:23:14.311
I'm gonna rip you
in half now.

01:23:14.355 --> 01:23:16.705
That is such
a Juggernaut thing to say.

01:23:20.753 --> 01:23:24.800
Oh, my God!
I can't feel my legs.

01:23:24.844 --> 01:23:25.932
I can't feel...

01:23:26.889 --> 01:23:28.412
Oh, no, they're right here.

01:23:29.239 --> 01:23:31.024
Got 'em.
God, Russell.

01:23:31.067 --> 01:23:33.417
I have a mission.

01:23:33.461 --> 01:23:35.028
To get my revenge.

01:23:35.071 --> 01:23:37.378
I'm going to burn
that headmaster alive.

01:23:37.421 --> 01:23:39.641
You're not the revenge type.

01:23:39.685 --> 01:23:41.208
Take it from a friend.

01:23:41.251 --> 01:23:45.081
Friend? You were sick,
and I protected you.

01:23:45.125 --> 01:23:47.301
You said it yourself.

01:23:47.344 --> 01:23:50.043
"I'm not your friend.
Find someone stronger."

01:23:50.086 --> 01:23:51.522
So I did.

01:23:53.046 --> 01:23:55.222
Russell, I couldn't
protect you back then.

01:23:55.265 --> 01:23:59.269
But I can now. What do you
want me to say, huh?

01:23:59.313 --> 01:24:01.184
"I care about you"?
'Cause goddamn it,

01:24:01.228 --> 01:24:03.665
I care about you, Russell.

01:24:03.709 --> 01:24:05.798
What's Juggernaut got
that I don't have?

01:24:05.841 --> 01:24:09.540
Don't you say legs!
I know you're gonna say legs!

01:24:09.584 --> 01:24:12.369
Legs! Still hurts to hear out loud!

01:24:14.545 --> 01:24:17.505
What is that?
That's not a real rope!

01:24:17.548 --> 01:24:19.855
You get back here, young man!

01:24:20.813 --> 01:24:22.292
Doms!

01:24:22.336 --> 01:24:24.555
Doms, get me
out of here, please.

01:24:24.599 --> 01:24:26.993
Use my arms
as backpack straps.

01:24:29.735 --> 01:24:30.823
I think we may have found

01:24:30.866 --> 01:24:33.042
your cosmic reason
for being here.

01:24:33.086 --> 01:24:34.870
I'm pretty sure
this isn't it.

01:24:34.914 --> 01:24:36.176
X-Force.

01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:51.539
No child is hopeless.

01:24:51.582 --> 01:24:55.064
Don't give up on the boy.
How could he just walk away?

01:24:55.108 --> 01:24:57.806
It was the coldness
in his eyes.

01:24:57.850 --> 01:24:59.416
You should've heard it.

01:25:01.331 --> 01:25:03.638
I guess family
really is an F-word.

01:25:04.552 --> 01:25:06.772
Rub my legs, Mama.

01:25:06.815 --> 01:25:08.208
Why would I
rub your legs?

01:25:08.251 --> 01:25:11.167
Please, they hurt.
I have growing pains.

01:25:14.301 --> 01:25:15.955
What in the...

01:25:15.998 --> 01:25:18.740
Why is your hand
so tiny again?

01:25:18.784 --> 01:25:20.611
That's not my hand.

01:25:20.655 --> 01:25:23.005
Oh! Mary,
mother of Joseph!

01:25:23.049 --> 01:25:24.964
That was nice for me.

01:25:25.007 --> 01:25:27.836
Wade! I heard what happened
with the convoy and...

01:25:32.275 --> 01:25:34.582
Why wouldn't you
cover that up?

01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.845
A warrior has nothing
to be ashamed of.

01:25:36.889 --> 01:25:38.847
Yeah, but you do.
Look at you.

01:25:38.891 --> 01:25:40.893
You're just
straight shirt-cocking it,

01:25:40.936 --> 01:25:42.416
toddler-style.

01:25:42.459 --> 01:25:44.418
Oh, yeah.
Full Winnie the Pooh.

01:25:44.461 --> 01:25:46.463
The hell's happening?
Describe it.

01:25:46.507 --> 01:25:47.789
I wouldn't ask him to do that,
if I were you.

01:25:47.813 --> 01:25:49.423
It's like, um... Here we go.

01:25:49.466 --> 01:25:50.748
It's like he was
giving birth anally,

01:25:50.772 --> 01:25:52.295
but they quit halfway through.

01:25:52.339 --> 01:25:53.490
They got the legs out,
and they said,

01:25:53.514 --> 01:25:54.863
"You know what, I'm done."

01:25:54.907 --> 01:25:56.169
Happy?

01:25:56.212 --> 01:25:57.320
It's like he's a Muppet
from the waist down.

01:25:57.344 --> 01:25:58.519
But this time, you can see

01:25:58.562 --> 01:25:59.999
the Muppet's dick.

01:26:00.042 --> 01:26:01.565
Grover's got a cock
the size of a twig.

01:26:01.609 --> 01:26:02.804
Mr. Weasel, I can
no longer be double-parked.

01:26:02.828 --> 01:26:04.428
I've had three tickets
already.

01:26:05.918 --> 01:26:08.703
No, no, no, DP,
not again!

01:26:08.746 --> 01:26:11.358
This has happened before?

01:26:11.401 --> 01:26:12.901
Jesus! Either vomit or don't.

01:26:12.925 --> 01:26:14.230
The indecision is killing me.

01:26:14.274 --> 01:26:16.145
Why couldn't God
take my hearing?

01:26:17.755 --> 01:26:19.932
Oh. Wow!

01:26:19.975 --> 01:26:21.672
Cool your pits.
They're growing back.

01:26:21.716 --> 01:26:23.674
I'm talking about your face.

01:26:23.718 --> 01:26:25.633
I've never seen you
without your mask before.

01:26:25.676 --> 01:26:27.896
Jesus Christ! Looks like an avocado.

01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:29.855
Your legs, though,
they're cute.

01:26:29.898 --> 01:26:31.682
You wanna borrow
a pair of pants?

01:26:33.249 --> 01:26:34.860
I'm glad everybody dropped by.

01:26:34.903 --> 01:26:37.601
You must be wondering
why I didn't call you here.

01:26:37.645 --> 01:26:39.255
I'll tell you why I'm here.

01:26:39.299 --> 01:26:41.649
"The Time Traveler's Wife's"
husband...

01:26:41.692 --> 01:26:42.931
beat me within
an inch of my life.

01:26:42.955 --> 01:26:44.304
He was torturing me!

01:26:44.347 --> 01:26:47.220
But all I told him was
everything he wanted to know.

01:26:47.263 --> 01:26:49.918
So, I'm here
to help us gear up.

01:26:49.962 --> 01:26:51.113
So we can go after him
without me.

01:26:51.137 --> 01:26:52.529
No!

01:26:52.573 --> 01:26:53.922
I'm doing this alone.

01:26:53.966 --> 01:26:55.097
The Juggernaut

01:26:55.141 --> 01:26:56.577
will kill you all. Fair enough.

01:26:56.620 --> 01:26:58.511
I just need a couple of
hours to get some legs

01:26:58.535 --> 01:26:59.667
under me. What will you do?

01:26:59.710 --> 01:27:01.036
I don't care
what the kid did to me.

01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:02.409
I ain't letting Cable
get to him,

01:27:02.452 --> 01:27:03.821
even if I have to
teabag him to death.

01:27:03.845 --> 01:27:05.891
It's really just a sip of tea
at this point.

01:27:05.934 --> 01:27:07.718
Zip it, black Black Widow!
I'm flowing.

01:27:07.762 --> 01:27:08.826
The first order
of business is

01:27:08.850 --> 01:27:10.243
to get me in front of Cable...

01:27:10.286 --> 01:27:11.698
so I can pull all the fucking
blood out of his body...

01:27:11.722 --> 01:27:14.073
and fashion his bones
into holiday jewelry.

01:27:14.116 --> 01:27:15.944
Then,
I'm gonna take his skin...

01:27:15.988 --> 01:27:19.034
and stretch it out
over a homemade mating drum.

01:27:20.644 --> 01:27:22.244
He's standing right
behind you, isn't he?

01:27:30.916 --> 01:27:32.918
What in the ass?

01:27:32.961 --> 01:27:36.269
Is this apartment listed
on Tinder? Grindr?

01:27:36.312 --> 01:27:39.359
You picked the wrong shithole
to fuck, future boy.

01:27:39.402 --> 01:27:41.927
Ugh. Is that really necessary?

01:27:44.190 --> 01:27:46.975
No. It's his
"Basic Instinct."

01:27:47.019 --> 01:27:48.759
What can we help you with?

01:27:48.803 --> 01:27:50.457
I'm here to proposition you.

01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:53.068
Oh, boy!

01:27:53.112 --> 01:27:54.176
He's really teeing it up,
isn't he?

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:56.332
Who gets to make
the first joke?

01:27:56.376 --> 01:27:57.744
I think we should all do it
at the same time.

01:27:57.768 --> 01:27:58.813
Good call.

01:27:58.856 --> 01:28:00.423
For $45, you get sucky-suck.

01:28:00.467 --> 01:28:01.705
I only do over
the pants, mouth stuff.

01:28:01.729 --> 01:28:02.860
Fuck!

01:28:02.904 --> 01:28:04.012
The Proposition
has a wonderful

01:28:04.036 --> 01:28:05.341
Guy Pearce performance.

01:28:05.385 --> 01:28:07.145
Wait, wait, wait!
I wanna do mine over.

01:28:07.169 --> 01:28:09.780
Give us the line again. I need your help!

01:28:09.824 --> 01:28:12.131
Trust me, I'm even less happy
about this than you are...

01:28:12.174 --> 01:28:15.308
but you unleashed
the Juggernaut, you dumb cunt!

01:28:15.351 --> 01:28:17.745
I can't bring him down alone.

01:28:17.788 --> 01:28:19.312
So here we are.

01:28:20.661 --> 01:28:22.445
We're no longer
accepting applications

01:28:22.489 --> 01:28:23.925
for X-Force, unfortunately.

01:28:23.969 --> 01:28:25.405
Even if we were...

01:28:25.448 --> 01:28:27.122
there's a wind advisory
in effect until at least...

01:28:27.146 --> 01:28:28.408
We don't have a lot of time.

01:28:28.451 --> 01:28:30.192
Your friend's about
to make his first kill.

01:28:30.236 --> 01:28:31.759
No offense,
but if you know so much...

01:28:31.802 --> 01:28:34.675
why not travel back to when
he was a baby, kill him then?

01:28:34.718 --> 01:28:35.782
Or better yet, head back
a little further,

01:28:35.806 --> 01:28:36.894
kill baby Hitler.

01:28:36.938 --> 01:28:38.896
I use a device
to slide through time.

01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:41.595
The longer I travel,
the harder it is to control.

01:28:41.638 --> 01:28:44.250
I got two charges:
one to get me here,

01:28:44.293 --> 01:28:45.468
one to get me home.

01:28:45.512 --> 01:28:46.687
Well.

01:28:46.730 --> 01:28:48.645
That's just lazy writing.

01:28:48.689 --> 01:28:49.971
Your boy's
gonna kill the headmaster

01:28:49.995 --> 01:28:51.561
of the orphanage tonight.

01:28:51.605 --> 01:28:53.737
After that,
he gets a real taste for it.

01:28:53.781 --> 01:28:56.523
Like 10-year-old
Kirsten Dunst, motherfucker!

01:28:56.566 --> 01:28:58.568
So he keeps killing...

01:28:58.612 --> 01:29:00.092
and killing, and killing,

01:29:00.135 --> 01:29:01.658
and killing.

01:29:01.702 --> 01:29:04.922
Until one day, he kills
the wrong fucking people.

01:29:07.490 --> 01:29:08.883
My people.

01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.062
Relax.

01:29:14.106 --> 01:29:16.499
I'm retrieving something
from my utility bag.

01:29:16.543 --> 01:29:19.111
It's a goddamn fanny pack...

01:29:19.154 --> 01:29:21.765
and you know it,
you sick son of a bitch!

01:29:21.809 --> 01:29:23.463
The difference
is night and day.

01:29:25.291 --> 01:29:27.554
You remind me of my wife.

01:29:27.597 --> 01:29:29.077
I'm sorry.

01:29:29.121 --> 01:29:30.228
I said, "You remind me
of my wife."

01:29:30.252 --> 01:29:31.612
No, I'm sorry
that you said that...

01:29:31.645 --> 01:29:34.430
while making heavy eye contact
and applying lip balm.

01:29:34.474 --> 01:29:35.649
She always struggled.

01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:38.217
But she was funny...

01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:41.611
and filtered her pain
through the prism of humor.

01:29:41.655 --> 01:29:43.874
Something I could
never master.

01:29:44.788 --> 01:29:47.008
It was my fault she died.

01:29:48.618 --> 01:29:52.274
It was my job
to stop people like him.

01:29:52.318 --> 01:29:54.276
I came close a few times.

01:29:58.498 --> 01:30:00.152
He wasn't too happy
about that.

01:30:01.892 --> 01:30:03.068
He was trying to hurt me...

01:30:03.111 --> 01:30:05.070
and he knew exactly
how to do it.

01:30:09.117 --> 01:30:10.814
Blessed are the wicked

01:30:10.858 --> 01:30:12.425
who are healed by my hand.

01:30:15.558 --> 01:30:17.908
He came into my home...

01:30:17.952 --> 01:30:20.824
and took the only thing
that made it a home.

01:30:25.046 --> 01:30:26.395
Sound familiar?

01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:29.094
I'm sorry.Uh-huh.

01:30:29.137 --> 01:30:30.791
No, I'm really sorry.

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:35.143
But that isn't Russell.

01:30:35.187 --> 01:30:37.121
It doesn't have to be him.
If you knew what I knew...

01:30:37.145 --> 01:30:39.147
Yeah, he's got anger issues...

01:30:39.191 --> 01:30:40.757
maybe a small
learning disability...

01:30:40.801 --> 01:30:42.194
splash of diabetes...

01:30:42.237 --> 01:30:43.586
but nothing
that can't be fixed.

01:30:43.630 --> 01:30:45.284
If you could go back...

01:30:45.327 --> 01:30:48.025
and stop the people that took
your girl, would you?

01:30:48.287 --> 01:30:49.549
No.

01:30:49.592 --> 01:30:51.333
I'd buy them all
a bouquet of hand jobs.

01:30:51.377 --> 01:30:53.118
Of course I fucking would!

01:30:53.901 --> 01:30:55.032
But I wouldn't kill a kid.

01:30:55.076 --> 01:30:57.122
I'm not asking you
to kill a kid!

01:30:57.165 --> 01:30:58.732
I'll kill the kid.

01:30:58.775 --> 01:31:02.257
I'm asking you to save
hundreds of other kids.

01:31:02.301 --> 01:31:04.651
Russell's gonna burn down
that orphanage.

01:31:04.694 --> 01:31:06.740
And I can imagine
your dead girlfriend...

01:31:06.783 --> 01:31:09.046
would want you to do
the right thing, wouldn't she?

01:31:10.047 --> 01:31:13.225
So, what's it gonna be,
handsome?

01:31:13.268 --> 01:31:15.009
Give me a chance to save him.

01:31:15.052 --> 01:31:16.489
What? You said...

01:31:16.532 --> 01:31:18.206
once he kills someone,
he gets a taste for it.

01:31:18.230 --> 01:31:20.580
If we can get to him
before that happens...

01:31:20.623 --> 01:31:22.277
promise you'll give me
a chance

01:31:22.321 --> 01:31:24.192
to put him
on a different path.

01:31:24.236 --> 01:31:25.411
Define "chance."

01:31:25.454 --> 01:31:26.692
I don't know.
How long does it take

01:31:26.716 --> 01:31:28.085
to save someone's soul?
That's not...

01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:29.371
I'll give you 30 seconds.

01:31:29.415 --> 01:31:31.460
What? No! Best I can do.

01:31:31.504 --> 01:31:32.809
Take it or leave it.

01:31:43.255 --> 01:31:44.734
He's doing it!

01:31:44.778 --> 01:31:46.388
Look at the little fella.
He's doing it.

01:31:46.432 --> 01:31:48.390
There he goes.

01:31:48.434 --> 01:31:49.913
Jesus Christ!

01:31:49.957 --> 01:31:51.437
Just shirt-cocking it.

01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:53.395
Ugh.

01:31:53.439 --> 01:31:54.799
There you go, little fella.

01:31:55.528 --> 01:31:57.225
Go on, you're doing it!

01:31:57.269 --> 01:32:00.141
My beautiful, hairless,
Twizzler-legged baby boy.

01:32:02.317 --> 01:32:03.449
Christ!

01:32:03.492 --> 01:32:05.190
That's disturbing.

01:32:05.233 --> 01:32:06.626
30 seconds.

01:32:12.022 --> 01:32:13.502
Deal.Deal.

01:32:19.943 --> 01:32:23.033
Man, that sucks they didn't
have anything in your size.

01:32:23.077 --> 01:32:25.079
I really wanted to match,
you know?

01:32:25.122 --> 01:32:27.168
Being a menacing team.

01:32:27.212 --> 01:32:28.387
Oh, man, it sucks.

01:32:28.430 --> 01:32:30.302
That was some
cold-ass shit, kid.

01:32:31.694 --> 01:32:34.262
And that is just
the first five steps

01:32:34.306 --> 01:32:36.003
to a prostate-assisted orgasm.

01:32:36.917 --> 01:32:38.353
Where the hell
are we going?

01:32:38.397 --> 01:32:39.746
You said it yourself.

01:32:39.789 --> 01:32:42.705
Nothing can stop the
Juggernaut. We need backup.

01:32:42.749 --> 01:32:45.708
I will bathe in the blood
of your enemies.

01:32:49.843 --> 01:32:51.453
Can you turn off the music?

01:32:52.454 --> 01:32:54.587
You'll do no such thing.

01:32:54.630 --> 01:32:56.502
Why don't you just say it
in an Indian accent?

01:32:56.545 --> 01:32:58.286
I'm sorry? Apology accepted.

01:32:58.330 --> 01:33:00.419
This is a side of you
I do not like.

01:33:00.462 --> 01:33:01.811
Let me guess,

01:33:01.855 --> 01:33:03.354
some of your best friends
in the future are Indian.

01:33:03.378 --> 01:33:04.640
What the hell are you...?

01:33:04.684 --> 01:33:06.555
Once again, intolerance rears
its ugly head.

01:33:06.599 --> 01:33:07.904
I am so sorry.
It gets better.

01:33:07.948 --> 01:33:09.515
I'm not a fucking racist,
moron!

01:33:09.558 --> 01:33:11.604
That's precisely
what a racist would say.

01:33:11.647 --> 01:33:13.301
I'm with the old white guy
on this one.

01:33:13.345 --> 01:33:14.607
And that's a twist.

01:33:14.650 --> 01:33:16.173
When this is over...

01:33:16.217 --> 01:33:18.108
I'm going to fuck you to death
with your own broken feet.

01:33:18.132 --> 01:33:20.308
And a sexual predator, too.
That's rich.

01:33:20.352 --> 01:33:21.744
I should have
finished college.

01:33:21.788 --> 01:33:22.939
So what exactly do you

01:33:22.963 --> 01:33:24.027
do in the future, anyway, huh?

01:33:24.051 --> 01:33:25.313
Some kind of soldier?

01:33:25.357 --> 01:33:27.184
Yeah, something like that.

01:33:27.228 --> 01:33:29.404
I was a soldier.
Special Forces.

01:33:29.448 --> 01:33:32.146
I bet 50 years from now,
we're bestest buddies.

01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:34.191
50 years from now,
you're very dead.

01:33:34.235 --> 01:33:36.629
Your entire generation fucked
this planet into a coma.

01:33:36.672 --> 01:33:38.283
Boom!

01:33:38.326 --> 01:33:39.588
Spoiler alert.

01:33:40.807 --> 01:33:42.156
Planets.

01:33:42.199 --> 01:33:43.766
Next time, Uber.

01:33:43.810 --> 01:33:45.115
Here's a spoiler alert.

01:33:46.291 --> 01:33:48.249
You're not a fucking hero.

01:33:48.293 --> 01:33:52.340
You're just an annoying clown
dressed up as a sex toy.

01:33:52.384 --> 01:33:53.578
Well, I got news for you.

01:33:53.602 --> 01:33:54.951
My heart
is in the right place.

01:33:54.995 --> 01:33:56.518
Russell's not
gonna kill anyone.

01:33:56.562 --> 01:33:58.540
Because of me, he's gonna know
what real love looks like.

01:33:58.564 --> 01:33:59.652
We're all going to die.

01:33:59.695 --> 01:34:00.957
Because of you,
I'll always know

01:34:01.001 --> 01:34:02.959
what a grown man
with baby balls looks like.

01:34:03.003 --> 01:34:05.397
I'm a grower, not a shower.

01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:06.615
God, I wish this were a bus

01:34:06.659 --> 01:34:07.853
where I could pull
the string and get out.

01:34:07.877 --> 01:34:09.531
It's a good thing
Cable's not driving,

01:34:09.575 --> 01:34:10.793
or you'd be in the back.

01:34:10.837 --> 01:34:13.187
- I am in the back.
- Right here!

01:34:31.336 --> 01:34:33.381
I made mistakes!

01:34:33.425 --> 01:34:35.122
I wanna take them back!

01:34:35.165 --> 01:34:38.125
You trusted me.
I took that trust...

01:34:38.168 --> 01:34:39.605
and turned it
into a glory hole

01:34:39.648 --> 01:34:41.215
in an airport bathroom.

01:34:41.258 --> 01:34:44.523
The one in Minneapolis.
You know the one.

01:34:44.566 --> 01:34:47.177
But even you know I'm not
a complete piece of shit.

01:34:47.221 --> 01:34:48.744
I was once an X-Man.

01:34:48.788 --> 01:34:49.832
Trainee!

01:34:54.489 --> 01:34:57.057
You're still using
my Velcro labels. Aw.

01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.711
They do stick better
than tape.

01:34:58.754 --> 01:34:59.799
Hi, Wade!

01:34:59.842 --> 01:35:01.278
Please don't.

01:35:01.322 --> 01:35:03.716
Say whatever it is you're here
to say. Make it quick.

01:35:03.759 --> 01:35:05.021
Right. Quick.

01:35:05.065 --> 01:35:06.782
It's the kid.
Just like you, I let him down.

01:35:06.806 --> 01:35:08.242
And just like me,

01:35:08.285 --> 01:35:09.437
he's never had anyone
sacrifice anything for him...

01:35:09.461 --> 01:35:10.481
because the whole world
wrote him off

01:35:10.505 --> 01:35:11.941
as a piece of shit
a long time ago.

01:35:11.985 --> 01:35:13.682
Look, he's teamed up
with the Juggernaut!

01:35:13.726 --> 01:35:15.249
The Juggernaut!

01:35:15.292 --> 01:35:17.053
Who's, like, my favorite
Marvel character ever...

01:35:17.077 --> 01:35:19.296
And hi, Yukio! That was really
nice of you to say hi...

01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:20.689
so I'm saying hi back.

01:35:20.733 --> 01:35:22.125
You guys make
a super cute couple.

01:35:22.169 --> 01:35:23.866
Yeah. Where was I?

01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:25.781
Oh, yeah. You should never
meet your heroes...

01:35:25.825 --> 01:35:27.522
because, honestly,
he's a bit of a dick!

01:35:27.566 --> 01:35:29.406
And like a lot of dicks,
he's hard as a rock...

01:35:29.437 --> 01:35:30.830
and causes nothing
but problems!

01:35:30.873 --> 01:35:33.746
Look, you can stop the
Juggernaut. I know you can.

01:35:33.789 --> 01:35:37.010
Do you know what would happen
to me if I helped you?

01:35:37.053 --> 01:35:39.142
I would be disgraced.

01:35:39.186 --> 01:35:41.231
You are a criminal,
a fugitive.

01:35:41.275 --> 01:35:42.798
But worst of all...

01:35:42.842 --> 01:35:44.583
you broke my heart, Wade.

01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.499
Then you know what?

01:35:47.542 --> 01:35:49.142
Your heart's in
the wrong place, big guy.

01:35:50.197 --> 01:35:52.895
Doing the right thing
is sometimes messy...

01:35:52.939 --> 01:35:56.333
and fucked up, and not
particularly convenient!

01:35:56.377 --> 01:35:59.467
So stay here
in Chateau de Virgin...

01:35:59.511 --> 01:36:01.643
while we go get our fuck on!

01:36:04.820 --> 01:36:06.213
You're doing great.

01:36:11.871 --> 01:36:13.414
So you wear
that helmet because

01:36:13.438 --> 01:36:15.178
your brother
tries to read your mind?

01:36:15.222 --> 01:36:18.486
Yeah, but he's in
a wheelchair, so even-steven.

01:36:18.530 --> 01:36:21.010
Someone's coming.
It's Russell, sir.

01:36:21.054 --> 01:36:23.012
And he's not alone.

01:36:23.056 --> 01:36:24.710
Secure the children.

01:36:27.147 --> 01:36:29.889
They will not replace us.

01:36:29.932 --> 01:36:32.718
What do you say
we go fuck some shit up?

01:36:32.761 --> 01:36:36.591
"Let's fuck some shit up"
is my legal middle name.

01:36:39.942 --> 01:36:42.554
Watch my back.
I've got the old man.

01:36:42.597 --> 01:36:44.164
Amen, brother.

01:36:50.692 --> 01:36:52.346
Time to make the chimichangas.

01:36:52.389 --> 01:36:54.566
30 seconds.

01:36:54.609 --> 01:36:57.133
I finally know why I'm here.

01:36:57.177 --> 01:36:59.135
I was raised in this place.

01:36:59.179 --> 01:37:01.442
Well, not raised.
I was tortured.

01:37:01.486 --> 01:37:04.358
Wow! It's your cosmic reason
for being here.

01:37:04.401 --> 01:37:05.707
Shall we? This is gonna be fun.

01:37:05.751 --> 01:37:06.839
Yeah!

01:37:06.882 --> 01:37:08.275
Hey! Been meaning
to ask you...

01:37:08.318 --> 01:37:11.583
what's with the dirty,
disgusting hobo bear?

01:37:11.626 --> 01:37:14.803
It's not dirt. It's the blood
of my dead daughter.

01:37:14.847 --> 01:37:17.545
Are You Bear, God?
It's Me, Margaret.

01:37:17.589 --> 01:37:19.025
Give me some.

01:37:19.068 --> 01:37:20.635
They say
laughter heals anything...

01:37:20.679 --> 01:37:21.810
except, of course, that.

01:37:21.854 --> 01:37:23.072
We should just cue the music.

01:37:48.228 --> 01:37:50.926
Welcome home, Russell.
We missed you.

01:37:52.145 --> 01:37:53.189
Russell!

01:37:53.233 --> 01:37:56.628
You don't need to do this!
Let's talk!

01:37:56.671 --> 01:37:58.191
Why are you dressed
like the Unabomber?

01:38:02.329 --> 01:38:03.591
That's why!

01:38:03.635 --> 01:38:04.960
Told you this little fucker's
too far gone.

01:38:04.984 --> 01:38:06.701
Zip it, Thanos!
We have a deal and you fuck...

01:38:06.725 --> 01:38:09.205
Hey!

01:38:09.249 --> 01:38:12.382
I'm gonna shove that
cab driver right up your ass.

01:38:13.514 --> 01:38:15.690
My body and my hands
are so soft.

01:38:15.734 --> 01:38:16.972
You should probably
head back to the car.

01:38:16.996 --> 01:38:18.693
I think I'll head
back to the car.

01:38:19.868 --> 01:38:22.567
It works best
when you pull the trigger.

01:38:25.482 --> 01:38:26.745
That gun is amazing!

01:38:28.094 --> 01:38:29.312
Say it!

01:38:31.488 --> 01:38:34.535
You are an abomination!

01:38:41.803 --> 01:38:45.111
Now, I'm gonna shove
the red guy up the old guy.

01:38:45.154 --> 01:38:47.592
I believe him!
Every man for themselves!

01:38:51.944 --> 01:38:53.032
Gotcha!

01:38:53.815 --> 01:38:54.990
Beat it, midget!

01:38:57.993 --> 01:39:01.083
Hey, big guy,
the sun's getting real low!

01:39:01.127 --> 01:39:02.215
Oh, shit fuck!

01:39:16.098 --> 01:39:17.665
Come here, beautiful.

01:39:25.455 --> 01:39:26.587
Whoo!

01:39:35.770 --> 01:39:36.858
Say it!

01:41:00.333 --> 01:41:01.464
You came for me.

01:41:01.508 --> 01:41:02.944
I'm not giving up on you,

01:41:02.988 --> 01:41:05.120
and you are not
giving up on that boy.

01:41:05.164 --> 01:41:07.209
Who says that rules
aren't meant to be broken?

01:41:07.253 --> 01:41:09.646
It's time to fight dirty.

01:41:09.690 --> 01:41:11.039
Time to sweep the leg, Johnny.

01:41:11.083 --> 01:41:13.868
Hey! Pick on someone
your own size!

01:41:13.912 --> 01:41:16.001
That's such
a you thing to say!

01:41:16.044 --> 01:41:18.003
Go get him, tiger!

01:41:18.046 --> 01:41:19.918
Big CGI fight coming up!

01:41:42.984 --> 01:41:44.377
He's doing great.

01:41:44.420 --> 01:41:45.639
Say it!

01:41:49.817 --> 01:41:51.210
- Russell.
- Bingo!

01:41:56.606 --> 01:41:58.608
You see that bus?

01:41:58.652 --> 01:41:59.852
I'm gonna
shove it up your ass.

01:42:03.222 --> 01:42:05.180
That's right!
I'm fighting dirty!

01:42:06.094 --> 01:42:07.139
Oh, great!

01:42:07.182 --> 01:42:08.594
There they are!
Those freaks!

01:42:08.618 --> 01:42:10.727
A bunch of armed
pedophiles in nursing shoes.

01:42:10.751 --> 01:42:12.884
Can I have
one of those guns?

01:42:12.927 --> 01:42:14.755
No.That's fine.

01:42:14.799 --> 01:42:16.757
Get off this property,
mutant scum!

01:42:16.801 --> 01:42:17.961
I'm just gonna
use this brick.

01:42:18.541 --> 01:42:19.629
Maximum effort.

01:42:25.679 --> 01:42:27.420
Who says you
can't go home again?

01:42:36.516 --> 01:42:37.909
Oh!

01:42:44.567 --> 01:42:45.568
Yeah!

01:42:47.788 --> 01:42:49.442
Say it.

01:42:49.485 --> 01:42:52.532
Say what you said
every time you tortured me!

01:42:53.054 --> 01:42:54.403
Say it!

01:42:54.447 --> 01:42:57.145
Blessed are the wicked
who are healed by my hand!

01:42:58.364 --> 01:43:00.496
Blessed are the wicked...

01:43:00.540 --> 01:43:01.758
who are healed...

01:43:02.237 --> 01:43:03.760
by my hand.

01:43:21.822 --> 01:43:23.519
You commie motherfucker!

01:43:50.590 --> 01:43:53.114
Oh, my God.
Did you feel that, too?

01:43:53.158 --> 01:43:55.377
Only best buddies
execute pedophiles together.

01:43:58.250 --> 01:44:00.600
You got 30 seconds,
you jabbering butt plug!

01:44:00.643 --> 01:44:01.862
Now we're getting it.

01:44:06.562 --> 01:44:08.825
I need a bus
to get you all out of here.

01:44:14.092 --> 01:44:15.136
Orphans.

01:44:16.311 --> 01:44:17.530
Oh, geez.

01:44:18.966 --> 01:44:21.664
It's time to burn
for what you've done!

01:44:21.708 --> 01:44:24.189
A child should not be burdened
with such power!

01:44:33.024 --> 01:44:34.068
Russell! Wait!

01:44:40.074 --> 01:44:41.380
Oh!

01:44:48.604 --> 01:44:50.737
Wait! He hasn't killed
anyone yet!

01:44:50.780 --> 01:44:52.802
What more do you need to see?
Don't you fucking dare!

01:44:52.826 --> 01:44:54.001
He's just a kid!

01:44:54.045 --> 01:44:55.960
Tick, tock. Meter's running!

01:45:08.668 --> 01:45:11.714
I'm gonna melt you down
and make a cock ring.

01:45:32.083 --> 01:45:34.737
I told you! Leave me alone! Come on!

01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:36.391
Listen to me!

01:45:59.632 --> 01:46:01.286
That's how we do it

01:46:01.329 --> 01:46:02.809
in Mother Russia.

01:46:05.029 --> 01:46:07.553
They say millennials are
the hardest to reach.

01:46:08.945 --> 01:46:12.166
Oh, no.
You're doing amazing.

01:46:13.472 --> 01:46:16.344
Damn, it feels good
to be a gangsta!

01:46:16.388 --> 01:46:18.216
Go home, Wade!

01:46:18.259 --> 01:46:20.087
You're ruining everything!

01:46:25.440 --> 01:46:26.789
I'm getting good at this shit.

01:46:26.833 --> 01:46:28.139
Go, go, go!

01:46:31.359 --> 01:46:33.318
He dies tonight, Wade.

01:46:33.361 --> 01:46:35.842
You can't stop me!

01:46:35.885 --> 01:46:37.757
He even runs
like a fucking pervert.

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:40.542
Like an online predator
who lost his laptop.

01:46:41.978 --> 01:46:43.458
There's one bullet left
in that gun.

01:46:43.502 --> 01:46:45.504
Wait, wait, wait!
Please, just give me a second!

01:46:45.547 --> 01:46:47.027
I got this.

01:46:47.071 --> 01:46:49.290
Russell! Stay back! Go home, Wade!

01:46:49.334 --> 01:46:52.032
Let's talk. It doesn't
have to go this way!

01:46:52.076 --> 01:46:53.729
That piece of shit...

01:46:53.773 --> 01:46:55.514
he deserves to die
for what he did to you.

01:46:55.557 --> 01:46:58.952
He hurt you badly.
Makes you wanna hurt others.

01:46:59.822 --> 01:47:01.607
But if you kill him, he wins.

01:47:01.650 --> 01:47:05.524
You become everything
he says you are, but worse.

01:47:05.567 --> 01:47:07.569
You're just a kid.

01:47:07.613 --> 01:47:09.354
You don't wanna hurt anyone.

01:47:09.397 --> 01:47:10.659
How do you know what I want?

01:47:10.703 --> 01:47:12.313
Because I've been inside you.

01:47:13.009 --> 01:47:14.881
That came out wrong.

01:47:14.924 --> 01:47:16.622
I've been inside your shoes.

01:47:16.665 --> 01:47:18.537
Which is also off-putting.

01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:20.060
It's not a great analogy.

01:47:20.104 --> 01:47:21.931
The point is...

01:47:21.975 --> 01:47:23.672
there are people...

01:47:23.716 --> 01:47:26.762
There are people
in this fucking world...

01:47:26.806 --> 01:47:29.504
besides him,
who will treat you right.

01:47:29.548 --> 01:47:32.159
It isn't too late.
Don't do it.

01:47:37.730 --> 01:47:40.124
I never should've left
you there.

01:47:41.864 --> 01:47:43.736
I never should've left you
in that prison.

01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:52.136
I can't trust you.

01:47:53.833 --> 01:47:56.183
I can't trust anybody!

01:48:05.410 --> 01:48:06.672
Wonderful kid.

01:48:06.715 --> 01:48:08.500
You can't stop me, Wade!

01:48:10.719 --> 01:48:12.982
I got one more idea.

01:48:13.026 --> 01:48:15.942
It's just a really bad one,
even for me.

01:48:15.985 --> 01:48:17.248
Wade, what are you doing?

01:48:17.291 --> 01:48:19.598
All right. This is for
all the marbles, kid!

01:48:19.641 --> 01:48:21.730
You're gonna kill
someone today...

01:48:21.774 --> 01:48:23.210
Blessed are the wicked...

01:48:23.254 --> 01:48:25.169
...then it's gotta be me.

01:48:26.257 --> 01:48:28.172
...who are healed by my hand!

01:48:31.262 --> 01:48:33.699
Fuck this!

01:49:34.412 --> 01:49:37.371
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

01:49:42.376 --> 01:49:43.899
Oh, that's not good.

01:49:45.466 --> 01:49:46.902
No, sir.

01:49:54.519 --> 01:49:57.435
You sacrificed yourself
for me.

01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:59.045
Yeah.

01:49:59.088 --> 01:50:01.308
And it was the best thing
I ever did.

01:50:03.267 --> 01:50:05.356
I told you
I care about you.

01:50:05.399 --> 01:50:07.183
You're a good kid, Russell.

01:50:08.881 --> 01:50:09.969
Hey.

01:50:11.275 --> 01:50:12.493
The bear.

01:50:12.537 --> 01:50:13.929
It worked.

01:50:20.893 --> 01:50:22.503
Because of you.

01:50:22.547 --> 01:50:24.853
No, Wade, because of you.

01:50:25.724 --> 01:50:27.813
Stop, stop, stop!

01:50:27.856 --> 01:50:29.031
Stop!

01:50:30.206 --> 01:50:33.166
Just let it happen, okay?

01:50:33.209 --> 01:50:36.909
I guess my heart was finally
in the right place.

01:50:36.952 --> 01:50:39.346
That riddle
is so fucked up.

01:50:44.177 --> 01:50:46.571
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:50:46.614 --> 01:50:47.963
Don't be. Don't be.

01:50:48.007 --> 01:50:50.226
I've been trying to make
this happen for a while.

01:50:50.270 --> 01:50:51.924
Please, just don't leave me.

01:50:51.967 --> 01:50:53.578
I don't wanna die
without an audience.

01:50:53.621 --> 01:50:55.275
We are not going anywhere.

01:50:55.319 --> 01:50:57.408
Oh, God, I hope
the Academy is watching.

01:50:57.451 --> 01:50:58.583
Just rest, okay?

01:51:00.411 --> 01:51:01.499
Papa.

01:51:03.718 --> 01:51:05.677
♪ Papa, can you hear me? ♪

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:13.946
♪ Papa, can you find me
in the night? ♪

01:51:35.228 --> 01:51:36.969
Before I go...

01:51:37.012 --> 01:51:38.710
Sorry, I got a bit more in me.

01:51:39.319 --> 01:51:40.668
Domino.

01:51:40.712 --> 01:51:45.151
I want you to have
my Adventure Timewatch.

01:51:47.675 --> 01:51:50.548
Turns out
that I'm the lucky one.

01:51:51.331 --> 01:51:52.419
Thank you.

01:51:53.768 --> 01:51:57.032
Hey, Sabrina,
the Teenage Witch.

01:51:57.076 --> 01:51:59.383
I liked you better
with your hair short.

01:51:59.426 --> 01:52:00.558
Think everyone did.

01:52:01.385 --> 01:52:04.126
Hi, Yukio. Hi, Wade!

01:52:06.128 --> 01:52:07.216
And you...

01:52:07.739 --> 01:52:09.741
Chrome Bone.

01:52:09.784 --> 01:52:12.700
I haven't always been
the best friend to you.

01:52:12.744 --> 01:52:15.050
But you've always been
that to me.

01:52:15.094 --> 01:52:16.443
So thank you.

01:52:18.619 --> 01:52:20.229
Say "fuck" for me.

01:52:21.056 --> 01:52:22.362
Just once. Come on,

01:52:22.406 --> 01:52:24.016
we'll do it together.
It's no big deal.

01:52:24.059 --> 01:52:27.106
Here we go. One, two, three.
F... F... F...

01:52:27.149 --> 01:52:28.324
Fuck.

01:52:28.368 --> 01:52:31.632
Wow! Enjoy hell, swamp mouth.

01:52:32.981 --> 01:52:36.071
And you, Cable.

01:52:36.115 --> 01:52:40.598
You get back to your family.
You tell 'em Wade says hi.

01:52:40.641 --> 01:52:44.297
And promise me.
Promise me one thing.

01:52:44.340 --> 01:52:45.733
That you'll start
judging people...

01:52:45.777 --> 01:52:47.169
not by the color
of their skin,

01:52:47.213 --> 01:52:49.084
but by the content
of their character.

01:52:49.824 --> 01:52:51.435
- Jesus.
- R-Dog?

01:52:52.610 --> 01:52:55.090
There you are. Hey!

01:52:55.134 --> 01:52:57.353
You're a superhero now, bubba.

01:52:57.397 --> 01:53:00.400
That's why it's high time
that you had a super suit.

01:53:00.444 --> 01:53:01.836
This one is yours.

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.621
You might wanna
get it steam cleaned.

01:53:03.664 --> 01:53:05.100
Especially around the pants.

01:53:05.144 --> 01:53:06.841
And let it out
a little in the waist.

01:53:07.799 --> 01:53:08.800
But, hey.

01:53:09.844 --> 01:53:11.193
Look.

01:53:11.237 --> 01:53:13.848
Family is not an F-word.

01:53:14.588 --> 01:53:15.937
All right?

01:53:15.981 --> 01:53:18.418
There's one out there
for you.

01:53:18.462 --> 01:53:20.159
Just keep looking, okay?

01:53:23.641 --> 01:53:26.426
Guys, for a second there...

01:53:27.253 --> 01:53:29.385
we made a pretty good team.

01:53:44.444 --> 01:53:46.446
Oh, it's so hard to go.

01:53:48.013 --> 01:53:50.319
I just love being around
you guys so much.

01:53:51.407 --> 01:53:52.626
So, so much.

01:53:53.366 --> 01:53:54.715
Mmm.

01:53:54.759 --> 01:53:57.588
No, I can feel it now.
Here it comes, yeah.

01:53:57.631 --> 01:54:01.461
I feel the soul
exiting the husk.

01:54:01.505 --> 01:54:02.506
Yeah.

01:54:04.377 --> 01:54:06.858
Can you see it?

01:54:06.901 --> 01:54:09.077
Do you see
that beautiful bright light?

01:54:10.557 --> 01:54:11.689
There it is.

01:54:17.956 --> 01:54:19.218
Oh, that's the sun.

01:54:19.261 --> 01:54:21.133
Don't stare
directly into that.

01:54:21.176 --> 01:54:22.613
I just have a few final words.

01:54:24.832 --> 01:54:26.225
Woodpecker.

01:54:27.008 --> 01:54:28.357
Gingivitis.

01:54:30.403 --> 01:54:31.752
Codswallop.

01:54:36.104 --> 01:54:38.063
Do You Want to
Build a Snowman?

01:55:53.051 --> 01:55:54.269
Sorry I'm late.

01:55:54.313 --> 01:55:56.010
There was a bunch

01:55:56.054 --> 01:55:57.422
of handicapable children
who were stuck in a tree.

01:55:57.446 --> 01:55:59.666
No.No.

01:55:59.710 --> 01:56:02.800
But I did have to help a kid.Yeah.

01:56:02.843 --> 01:56:04.758
He's got a terrible name. It's just awful.

01:56:04.802 --> 01:56:05.803
Ugh. I tried to tell him.

01:56:08.153 --> 01:56:09.589
Is this heaven?

01:56:10.459 --> 01:56:11.635
It is now.

01:56:15.116 --> 01:56:16.988
I am so sorry.

01:56:17.815 --> 01:56:19.164
It's okay.

01:56:39.010 --> 01:56:40.881
I missed you so much.

01:56:46.495 --> 01:56:48.149
What is it? What's wrong?

01:56:50.064 --> 01:56:52.153
It's not time.

01:56:52.197 --> 01:56:54.199
What do you mean
it's not time?

01:56:54.242 --> 01:56:55.853
I'm here, I made it.

01:56:55.896 --> 01:56:57.637
You can't stay. No, no, no.

01:56:57.681 --> 01:57:00.335
I'm staying. I'm not going
anywhere without you.

01:57:00.379 --> 01:57:01.815
It's okay.

01:57:01.859 --> 01:57:04.688
There's a time for us.
It's just not now.

01:57:05.732 --> 01:57:08.169
They need you. Who?

01:57:10.215 --> 01:57:11.520
Your F-word.

01:57:12.783 --> 01:57:13.784
Why?

01:57:13.827 --> 01:57:14.828
You'll find out.

01:57:16.090 --> 01:57:17.657
It's all right. I'll be here.

01:57:19.006 --> 01:57:21.792
It's pretty fucking
awesome over here.

01:57:21.835 --> 01:57:23.750
I can have anything I want.

01:57:23.794 --> 01:57:25.926
Can every day be
International Women's Day?

01:57:25.970 --> 01:57:27.536
It is heaven.

01:57:27.580 --> 01:57:28.799
I love you.

01:57:31.323 --> 01:57:34.065
I know. I love you, too.

01:57:34.674 --> 01:57:36.067
Now, go.

01:57:36.937 --> 01:57:38.939
Go on. Go, get out of here.

01:57:39.984 --> 01:57:40.985
Go.

01:57:43.814 --> 01:57:44.814
Hey!

01:57:47.818 --> 01:57:49.950
Kiss me
like you miss me, Red.

01:57:50.603 --> 01:57:51.735
Well, come here.

01:58:11.058 --> 01:58:12.799
Don't fuck Elvis.

01:58:12.843 --> 01:58:14.583
Ooh, too late. I'm sorry?

01:58:24.071 --> 01:58:25.333
Time to make the chimichangas.

01:58:25.377 --> 01:58:26.508
30 seconds.

01:58:26.552 --> 01:58:27.814
Hey. Been meaning
to ask you...

01:58:27.858 --> 01:58:30.338
what's with the creepy,
dirty hobo bear?

01:58:30.382 --> 01:58:32.558
It's my daughter's teddy bear.

01:58:32.601 --> 01:58:34.125
Her name's Hope.

01:58:34.168 --> 01:58:35.300
Well...

01:58:36.127 --> 01:58:38.042
What are you doing?

01:58:38.085 --> 01:58:39.739
Somebody swiped right.

01:58:52.491 --> 01:58:55.276
Tell me they got that
in slow motion.

01:58:58.192 --> 01:58:59.977
You sacrificed
yourself for me.

01:59:00.020 --> 01:59:01.543
It would seem I...

01:59:03.719 --> 01:59:04.982
Huh?

01:59:06.113 --> 01:59:08.463
Genuine, high-grade lead.

01:59:10.378 --> 01:59:13.425
You time-sliding
son of a bitch!

01:59:13.468 --> 01:59:15.035
You did this for me?

01:59:16.907 --> 01:59:19.997
Wait. You can't go back.

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:21.346
You used
the last of your fuel.

01:59:21.389 --> 01:59:23.130
What about your girl,
your wife?

01:59:23.174 --> 01:59:26.438
Now, my family's safe.
And I didn't do it for you.

01:59:27.918 --> 01:59:30.355
No, I'm gonna stick around
for a while...

01:59:30.398 --> 01:59:31.660
and make sure the world

01:59:31.704 --> 01:59:33.401
doesn't shit itself
into oblivion.

01:59:34.098 --> 01:59:36.970
No. You did it for me.

01:59:37.753 --> 01:59:39.190
No, I didn't.

01:59:39.233 --> 01:59:40.669
You did. I really didn't.

01:59:40.713 --> 01:59:42.553
Pretty sure you did.
No, I'm positive I didn't.

01:59:42.584 --> 01:59:44.369
Fine. All right,
let's flip a coin. Okay?

01:59:44.412 --> 01:59:47.154
Heads, you did it for me.
Tails, you did it for me.

01:59:47.198 --> 01:59:49.983
I'm not even gonna look,
because you did it for me.

01:59:50.027 --> 01:59:51.158
Say it again.

01:59:51.202 --> 01:59:52.812
- He did it for me.
- Jesus.

01:59:52.856 --> 01:59:54.659
We must get the collar off.
Forget it. It's no use.

01:59:54.683 --> 01:59:56.598
These collars
don't just come off.

01:59:56.642 --> 01:59:58.122
Wade.

01:59:58.165 --> 02:00:00.080
I have an idea.

02:00:00.124 --> 02:00:02.256
No, no, no!
Let's not do that. Please!

02:00:02.300 --> 02:00:04.737
I'd rather die of cancer.
Let's just...

02:00:04.780 --> 02:00:07.914
Oh, God! They do say the pen
is grosser than the sword.

02:00:07.958 --> 02:00:10.264
We need the code.

02:00:10.308 --> 02:00:12.223
Try, uh, seven?

02:00:12.266 --> 02:00:13.877
Settle down,
Captain Lucky.

02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:15.356
It's not gonna be one number.

02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:16.560
Oh, God, that's lazy writing.

02:00:17.489 --> 02:00:18.838
I still got it.

02:00:21.885 --> 02:00:23.843
Put that back
in your prison wallet.

02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:27.455
I don't know how to thank you.

02:00:27.499 --> 02:00:29.414
But I do know how to hug you.

02:00:29.457 --> 02:00:30.763
- No.
- Yes.

02:00:30.806 --> 02:00:32.286
Here we go. Bring it in.

02:00:32.330 --> 02:00:33.418
Come on.

02:00:33.461 --> 02:00:34.898
Pelvis to pelvis.

02:00:34.941 --> 02:00:36.290
Let's go tip to tip.

02:00:36.334 --> 02:00:38.902
There we go.
The kids call this docking.

02:00:40.599 --> 02:00:42.166
Is there a knife in my dick?

02:00:42.209 --> 02:00:44.013
There's a knife in your dick.
I'm just gonna back up now.

02:00:44.037 --> 02:00:45.952
Yeah, yeah. No need to go full Yentl.

02:00:45.996 --> 02:00:48.781
Gonna pretend
like that never happened.

02:00:48.824 --> 02:00:50.739
Let's go home, Russell.

02:00:54.395 --> 02:00:56.180
All you dirty mutants

02:00:56.223 --> 02:00:58.791
are gonna rot in hell
with the boy!

02:00:58.834 --> 02:01:01.925
Your souls
are beyond redemption!

02:01:01.968 --> 02:01:03.230
Let's see your soul, perv!

02:01:03.274 --> 02:01:06.103
No, no! No! No more!
We're better than that!

02:01:06.146 --> 02:01:07.452
We're better than him!

02:01:07.495 --> 02:01:10.107
No more senseless violence!
No more bloodshed!

02:01:10.150 --> 02:01:11.760
We'll let karma
take care of him.

02:01:11.804 --> 02:01:14.807
The day of reckoning is here!

02:01:24.121 --> 02:01:26.210
I'm gonna miss him.
He seemed great.

02:01:26.253 --> 02:01:27.472
Whoo!

02:01:27.515 --> 02:01:29.126
Courage, motherfuckers!

02:01:29.169 --> 02:01:30.649
And karma, motherfucker.

02:01:30.692 --> 02:01:32.105
I could hear you
coming the last 30 seconds.

02:01:32.129 --> 02:01:34.131
I could barely keep
a straight face.

02:01:34.174 --> 02:01:36.089
I want some more.

02:01:36.133 --> 02:01:37.873
I bet you do, Brown Panther.

02:01:37.917 --> 02:01:41.442
We should leave
before Fuckernaut wakes up.

02:01:41.486 --> 02:01:43.749
Good call.
You guys coming with us?

02:01:43.792 --> 02:01:45.751
No, we'll get the kids
back to the mansion.

02:01:45.794 --> 02:01:47.318
Besides, we're X-Men.

02:01:47.361 --> 02:01:50.016
No, you're X-People.

02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:51.409
You're exhausting.

02:01:51.452 --> 02:01:53.237
I see what you did there.
Puns.

02:01:53.280 --> 02:01:54.716
Our door's always open.

02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:56.544
That's kind, but
I'm not ready to date again.

02:01:56.588 --> 02:01:57.589
Let alone two women.

02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:00.418
God, you're a douche.

02:02:00.461 --> 02:02:02.594
Bye, Wade! Bye, Yukio!

02:02:05.292 --> 02:02:06.598
What do you get

02:02:06.641 --> 02:02:07.555
when you take
eight feet of chrome...

02:02:07.599 --> 02:02:08.774
one pinch of courage...

02:02:08.817 --> 02:02:10.036
a cup of good luck...

02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:11.646
a dab of racism...

02:02:11.690 --> 02:02:13.213
a splash of diabetes...

02:02:13.257 --> 02:02:15.650
and a wheelbarrow
full of stage four cancer?

02:02:15.694 --> 02:02:18.392
Answer: a family.

02:02:18.436 --> 02:02:21.569
See? I didn't lie
what kind of film this was.

02:02:21.613 --> 02:02:23.156
If there's anything
you take away today...

02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:26.139
other than the need to Google,
"What the fuck is dubstep?"...

02:02:26.183 --> 02:02:29.012
it's that we all need
to belong to someone.

02:04:26.085 --> 02:04:27.826
How something
so small generates

02:04:27.869 --> 02:04:29.436
enough energy
to reverse time is...

02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:31.873
Oh, just fix it, Eleven,

02:04:31.917 --> 02:04:34.180
or I'll take it
to the Genius Bar.

02:04:34.224 --> 02:04:35.462
Cable's gonna kill you
when he finds out.

02:04:35.486 --> 02:04:36.530
Never heard of him.

02:04:36.574 --> 02:04:38.053
Why do you think
I'm helping him?

02:04:39.316 --> 02:04:41.579
The Lord works
in mysterious ways,

02:04:41.622 --> 02:04:43.885
don't I? A good day.

02:04:44.625 --> 02:04:45.626
Bye, Wade!

02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:47.150
Bye, Yukio!

02:04:48.455 --> 02:04:50.979
That was probably a bad idea.

02:04:51.023 --> 02:04:52.024
What have we done?

02:05:10.564 --> 02:05:12.610
I hope we sharpened
the cream cheese spreader.

02:05:22.750 --> 02:05:24.187
I'll be right back!

02:05:26.189 --> 02:05:28.713
We're definitely naming
our kid Cher!

02:05:29.104 --> 02:05:30.105
Whoo!

02:05:31.933 --> 02:05:33.239
Peter!

02:05:33.283 --> 02:05:34.849
Whoo! X-Force!

02:05:34.893 --> 02:05:37.939
Walk away! Just walk away!

02:05:37.983 --> 02:05:39.985
But we're X-Force! Nope! We're not.

02:05:40.028 --> 02:05:41.378
X-Force is just
a marketing tool

02:05:41.421 --> 02:05:42.727
designed by Fox executives...

02:05:42.770 --> 02:05:44.468
to keep Josh Brolin employed.

02:05:44.511 --> 02:05:46.034
It doesn't exist.

02:05:46.078 --> 02:05:49.386
All right, well,
this has been pretty scary!

02:05:49.429 --> 02:05:51.126
And I need to feed my cat!

02:05:51.170 --> 02:05:53.651
Go home, Sugarbear. Go home.

02:05:53.694 --> 02:05:56.958
Okay. Will you give
Domino my email?

02:06:06.141 --> 02:06:08.013
Wade, is that you?

02:06:10.276 --> 02:06:11.625
I guess Stryker finally

02:06:11.669 --> 02:06:13.061
figured out
how to shut you up.

02:06:19.633 --> 02:06:23.028
Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

02:06:23.071 --> 02:06:25.117
Just cleaning up
the timelines!

02:06:25.160 --> 02:06:28.990
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

02:06:29.034 --> 02:06:31.254
and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.

02:06:31.645 --> 02:06:33.038
Huh?

02:06:33.081 --> 02:06:34.407
But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...

02:06:34.431 --> 02:06:36.389
to get back
in the saddle again.

02:06:37.303 --> 02:06:39.827
And when he does,
say yes.

02:06:41.089 --> 02:06:43.048
Oh, right.

02:06:43.962 --> 02:06:45.268
Love you!

02:06:47.618 --> 02:06:49.272
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

02:06:56.627 --> 02:06:58.455
You're welcome, Canada.

02:07:10.989 --> 02:07:12.164
Boy howdy.

02:07:14.035 --> 02:07:16.951
Hi. This is a toughie.

02:07:16.995 --> 02:07:18.431
Yeesh.

02:07:18.475 --> 02:07:21.869
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

02:07:21.913 --> 02:07:24.742
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

02:07:24.785 --> 02:07:27.571
Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.

02:07:28.398 --> 02:07:30.051
Oh, I'm going to hell.

02:07:30.095 --> 02:07:31.792
That makes two of us.

02:07:31.836 --> 02:07:33.446
You can do this.

02:07:33.490 --> 02:07:36.144
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

02:07:36.188 --> 02:07:37.320
All right.

02:07:44.675 --> 02:07:47.068
Maximum effort.

02:13:24.754 --> 02:13:27.060
That's okay.
Let me see here.

02:13:27.104 --> 02:13:28.627
Oh, God.

02:13:28.671 --> 02:13:30.629
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

02:13:30.673 --> 02:13:33.023
No one's ever changed you.

02:13:33.066 --> 02:13:35.808
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

02:13:35.852 --> 02:13:38.681
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

02:13:38.724 --> 02:13:41.292
which would makes sense,
wouldn't it? Yeah.

02:13:41.335 --> 02:13:42.510
I think we both know

02:13:42.554 --> 02:13:43.966
I don't have
what it takes to do this...

02:13:43.990 --> 02:13:46.166
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

02:13:46.210 --> 02:13:48.144
and then I'm gonna come back
with my friend, Cable.

02:13:48.168 --> 02:13:49.561
He loves killing kids.
