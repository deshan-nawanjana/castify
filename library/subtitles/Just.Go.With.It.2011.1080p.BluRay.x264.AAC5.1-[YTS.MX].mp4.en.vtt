00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.580
I'm so happy you picked this dress, Veruca!

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.660
You look beautiful. Doesn't she?

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.100
You guys, I'm getting married!

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.900
I'm getting married!

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.580
Not without your veil, you're not.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.020
Where is that bad boy?

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.380
Oh, I think I left it upstairs.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.220
Don't worry. I'll get it,

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.980
sis.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.660
She is so annoying.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.340
And so ugly.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.260
She looks like Karl Malden.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.580
I know, and she's gonna be

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.660
my sister-in-law in an hour!

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.460
COLBY: How are you gonna deal with that?

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.420
VERUCA: I'm just gonna lay down the law for Danny.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.100
We're seeing his goofy family as little as possible.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.740
DANA: You sure he's gonna go along with that?

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.940
VERUCA: (SCOFFS) Danny doesn't say no to me.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.180
Believe me, I have him well-trained.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.420
(WOMEN LAUGHING)

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.500
So, tell us, what happened with Eric last night?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.620
(SHUSHING)

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.820
So, I told him if he wanted to stop the wedding,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.460
he had to speak now or forever hold his peace.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:46.980
And what'd he say?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.540
He said he's never gonna settle down,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.300
and I should just go ahead and marry Danny.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.460
(ALL EXCLAIM)

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.380
Did he give you a wedding present, huh?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.780
You're so horny! Yeah.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:57.540
I guess you could call it that.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.980
DANA: You're so bad!

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:04.140
(SHUSHING) It's the last time, I swear.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.460
Yeah, right!

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.980
Danny is so sweet and considerate.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.060
And he's gonna be a cardiologist.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.980
So, I'm marrying him

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:13.980
and that zucchini in the middle of his face.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.620
JANA: His parents are disgusting, too!

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.620
COLBY: Close your eyes when he's on top!

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.540
DANA: And your thighs!

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.340
Cuz, I'm so sorry.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.140
DANNY: Yikes, that hurt.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.100
That was me, Danny Maccabee, 20 years ago.

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.260
Pathetic, huh?

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.620
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.580
So, I'm halfway done boozing away my sorrows,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.340
when something pretty interesting happened.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.580
Oh, baby, you're like a Pop Tart,

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.660
hot and sweet!

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.700
(WHOOPING)

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.860
Hey, mami!

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.700
You must play the trumpet or something,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.940
'cause you're making me feel all horny and stuff!

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.580
You dropped your purse.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.140
Can I just sit for 10 seconds

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.460
and not get hit on? Thank you.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.220
I was just letting you know you dropped your purse.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.340
(GROANS)

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.540
I'm sorry. I thought... That's fine, that's fine.

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.140
I'm sure you didn't meet the
lady who gave you that ring

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.020
in a meat market like this.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.740
School cafeteria.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.860
How long you been married?

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.780
DANNY: I was gonna tell her, I really was.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.820
But I didn't want her to know what a loser I was,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.460
so I stretched the truth a little.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.620
Six years.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.460
Where's your wife tonight?

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.540
I stopped asking that question a long time ago.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.340
That's terrible.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.100
My wife says I work too much.

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.620
Trying to provide for her, her shopping addiction,

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.100
and crack.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.940
Why don't you just leave her?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.900
The children.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.740
All 14 of them.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.300
I just, I like to adopt,

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.740
and I don't wanna stop doing that.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.940
You poor guy.

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.100
You wanna get outta here?

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.060
DANNY: And so I discovered

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.980
the power of the wedding ring.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:05.740
The symbol of my humiliation

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.260
had become a tool to get back on the horse.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.100
Are you kidding me? Snuffleupagus!

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.700
I switched my specialty from
cardiology to plastic surgery,

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:17.620
got rid of the big honker,

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.180
and the ring became my thing.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.620
I just assumed after we got married
she'd stop hooking, but...

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.420
You need to put this wedding band on a true heart.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.020
This is a good moment.

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.820
Yeah. Should we go make it last,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.020
for a while, somewhere?

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.100
Okay, let's go. To your dorm.

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.980
DANNY: Sometimes I think about

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.620
throwing the ring into the ocean.

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.180
I know how wrong it is. But I can't.

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:49.380
(MIMICKING GOLLUM) It's my Precious.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.060
Besides, being fake married

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.780
is the perfect way to make sure

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.820
I never get my heart broken again.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.660
What are these?

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.900
(EXHALES)

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.060
Boobie bags.

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.380
The women, they stick them in their flat chesties,

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.460
make them big.

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.500
These are not the boobie bags that I ordered.

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.860
What is that?

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.580
It's like a syrup dispenser at an IHOP.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.740
I don't know what that is.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.540
Come on. These, they don't feel like these.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:32.340
No... Seriously?

Listen, Dr. Maccabee would
never accept subpar boobs.

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.500
Would you please just get me what I ordered

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.140
and tell Omar that I would like a
discount for the inconvenience?

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.180
Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Simon.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:46.740

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.100
Well, I, uh... I had bad plastic surgery.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.220
Should've known this doctor was a quack.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:00.260
His office was in, like, a warehouse.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.460
I see, I see.

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:05.620
Questions?

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.780
No, no. Just, please help me, Doctor.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.180
Absolutely. It's usually easier

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.940
to do these things right the first time, but...

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:16.900
What? You seem dubious.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:17.980
Hmm?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.500
Oh, no, not at all.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.420
I mean, I hear you're the best, Dr. Maccabee.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.300
I don't know about that,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.220
but I think we can figure something out here.

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.580
Relax, relax.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.700
That's relaxed? Hmm.

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.660
Here, let me just pull it down for a sec.

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.060
And I let go. Okay, shoots right
back up there. (SNICKERS)

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.980
I'm sorry. Oh. Sorry about what?

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.740
Oh, my God! It's just...

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:48.940
That just really went right up there.

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.860
That was high. You gotta watch that.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.940
It's gonna get caught in your hair.

00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:56.500
I don't know, maybe I should just keep it like this.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.100
It seems to make other people happy.

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.620
No. But, seriously, are you available
for my kid's birthday party?

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:02.700
(LAUGHING)

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.340
DANNY: That's too much. I'm sorry!

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:05.460
Let me give you a hug.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.420
That's what you need first. We'll fix this.

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.780
Mmm.

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.260
Oh, God! Okay, I gotta...

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.860
I'm gonna excuse myself. I'm sorry.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:19.900
Oh.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.300
Oh, my gosh.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.460
Brows gone wild over here.

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.780
I'm actually digging it.

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:25.860
And what are you doing later?

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:26.980
(LAUGHS) Oh!

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:30.380
Oh, sorry, I'm kind of seeing
anybody else. There you go.

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.100
Oh, browch. (LAUGHS)

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:33.380
My gosh.

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:34.940
Look, I don't know who you're seeing,

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:36.340
but whoever they are,

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:40.380
they don't have what this guy's got down
there, you know what I mean?

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.740
All right, Eddie.

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.780
Yeah, it's a very good one. I should know, I installed it.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:46.380
Oh, you had a penile enlargement?

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:48.740
Yes.

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.500
People really do that? That is hilarious!

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.180
See you on the 28th, Dr. Maccabee!

00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.900
Dude, why are you telling everybody
about my surgery?

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.780
Am I hiding the secrets around here?

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.260
You don't think Katherine knows about this?

00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:06.220
Katherine was in the room when I did that.

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.860
She held the magnifying glass.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:09.580
I did. And the tweezer.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.020
Real nice.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.620
Did you get a chance to try it out yet?

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.780
Uh, yeah. I've banged it up.

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:18.020
It's got a couple dents. I'm not gonna lie.

00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:20.060
Yeah. You did?

00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:21.940
Not from a human.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.700
It's got... From this doll I made.

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:25.220
Oh.

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:35.780
Hey, Adon. Yo, yo.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.220
Danny! I am so happy you could be here!

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:40.100
How are you, baby? Did you bring any Botox?

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.500
I didn't bring the Botox. I brought my cousin, Eddie.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.140
Nice to meet you, Eddie.

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.580
Is this a Halloween party?

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.300
Are you kidding me right now?

00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.580
You got a little more work done, huh?

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.660
Yeah, just a little bit, just tweaking, tweaking.

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.260
Maintenance, maintenance.

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.500
I just wanna stay in the game, Danny.

00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:57.100
I don't wanna hit home runs,
just some singles. That's all.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.900
You gotta stop, though, I'm telling you.

00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:00.460
Do you have any feeling in your face?

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:02.500
Just in this one spot right here.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:06.460
And then from the eyebrows down, dead, dead.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.380
(STRAINED LAUGHING)

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.260
Is that a car alarm?

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:13.340
He's laughing, he's laughing. Oh, okay.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.740
I wanted to go to your cousin Danny here,

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.300
but he refused to do any work.

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.940
He didn't wanna put his fingers in the pie. Ooh!

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.500
It was getting dangerous. This amount...

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.140
You gotta slow it down.

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.100
Okay, see? That shouldn't be happening right now.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.980
Adon! Adon, Adon, Adon!

00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.540
Ariel cut open his knee. It looks awful.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.700
What happened? Settle, settle.

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.980
What do you expect me to do about it?

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:34.140
It's bleeding. You know what? I could stitch him up.

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:35.860
Why don't you go get me my bag? All right.

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.100
So, you fell down the stairs, huh?

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:39.460
Yeah.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.620
Mmm-hmm.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.180
Did you trip over something?

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.660
Was there a skateboard there, or...

00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:46.220
No, I was distracted by something.

00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.860
What distracted you?

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:49.100
A girl.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:51.980
A girl, okay. Was it your mother?

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.220
No!

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.620
'Cause she just looks good.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.060
That's your stepmom. I can talk like that.

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.180
All right. This is lidocaine. Don't think about it.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:01.020
(GROANS) Ow!

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.060
Don't think about it. Think about your face.

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:04.220
Good, good.

00:10:04.660 --> 00:10:05.820
Blonde, brunette, redhead?

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.740
Blonde, tan, tall, rocking body.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.180
Nipples.

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.300
Want me to numb something else for you?

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.660
You're getting a little nutty over there.

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:18.340
(EXCLAIMS) No! No, I'm good. I'm good.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.700
I'm alive! I'm alive, everybody!

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.900
Good job, Doctor. That was really nice.

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:36.940
The distraction, I'm guessing.

00:10:37.100 --> 00:10:38.100
The what?

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:40.820
The boy was distracted. That's why he fell.

00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.180
So, I'm taking the rap for this.

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.900
Yes. Your hotness basically pushed
him down the stairs.

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.700
Good luck proving that in court, Wisengruber.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:49.500
Wisengruber? Is that what they're saying

00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:50.940
on the Gossip Girl nowadays?

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:54.300
I knew you two would eventually find each other!

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.180
But be careful, Palmer, these plastic surgeons,

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.580
they really know how to operate.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:00.740
(STRAINED LAUGHING)

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.820
Yeah, all right, Adon. All right.

00:11:08.220 --> 00:11:10.660
PALMER: I just don't know about plastic surgery.

00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.300
I mean, doesn't it always look so fake?

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.620
Depends who's doing it. I'm pretty
good at it. I'm telling you.

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.700
Some of my patients are here tonight. Oh, really?

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:17.820
Really, really. Look around,

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.300
see if you can find someone decent-looking.

00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:23.460
How 'bout her?

00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:25.100
The lady from Saw?

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.620
Fine. Who did you do?

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:29.740
All right. I hate to rat the guy out,

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:31.660
but see that guy over there?

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:33.660
You mean Sexy Ass?

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:36.300
Before I met him, he was No Buns Bobby.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.500
Really?

00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:39.700
His back went straight to his legs. No kidding.

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.860
He'd go to the bathroom,

00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:42.020
he'd slide right in the toilet.

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:45.620
I know, I know, that's really romantic, isn't it?

00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.300
So, North Carolina, how long
have you lived here in LA?

00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:50.820
I've been here almost two years.

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.340
Uh-huh. That's a lot of auditioning for you.

00:11:53.780 --> 00:11:54.940
You think I'm an actress?

00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.340
I guarantee you're an actress.

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.180
Well, guess again, Doc. I teach sixth grade math.

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:02.500
They got no schools in North Carolina to teach at?

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.980
My parents divorced.

00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:07.420
Had a pretty nasty one, actually,

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:09.060
when I was in the eighth grade. Mmm-hmm.

00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:13.620
And... I don't know. I got tired of picking sides, so...

00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:18.140
Okay. I thought I'd make a change
and, yeah, move out to LA.

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.980
You came to the right place.
No one gets divorced in LA.

00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:22.300
Mmm-hmm.

00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:27.020
I've never hung out with a girl your age. This is nice.

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:30.260
Oh, no. Your first lie to me.

00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:32.660
You're good. All right.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.020
I've never hung out with a girl your age and

00:12:36.380 --> 00:12:39.020
connected the way we are right now.

00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.340
Actually, I've never connected with,

00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:43.380
I don't think any girl at any age.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.460
See? I can tell when you're lying

00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.580
and when you're telling the truth. Oh.

00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:52.420
Yeah. The second thing I said was the truth.

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.020
I know.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.340
Oh, my God. That was the greatest night of my life.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:13.580
Yeah. This feels like it could be...

00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:16.060
I don't know, a real thing.

00:13:17.460 --> 00:13:19.700
It's a thing all right, Palmer.

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:21.660
Well, I have to get to work,

00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.060
but how 'bout I take your number

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:26.420
and then you can take me out
on a proper date next time?

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:30.620
I got a business card in my pocket
if you wanna get that.

00:13:31.140 --> 00:13:32.940
You better call. (LAUGHING)

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.140
You better not just, just leave me hanging.

00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:37.180
I'd get it for you myself,

00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.340
but I don't want you to see me naked in the daylight.

00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:41.300
It could be a deal breaker.

00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:47.620
What's this?

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:50.420
A circle?

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:53.220
A wedding ring? You're married?

00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:55.620
No, no, no, I'm not, I'm not married.

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:58.900
That is a... That is... That's not mine.

00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:02.300
Whose wedding ring is in your pants, Danny?

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:06.420
All right, listen, just give me a minute to explain this.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:07.820
Please.

00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:10.140
It's gonna take more than a minute.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:11.660
I am such an idiot!

00:14:11.740 --> 00:14:12.940
No, no, no, no, no.

00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.860
Don't call me!

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.580
No, Palmer!

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.060
(GROANS)

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.860
I told you that this whole fake marriage thing

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.860
was just gonna come and bite you in the ass.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:26.700
Why don't you just tell her the truth?

00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:28.660
You think I can tell her the truth?

00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:31.260
Let me practice. You be her right now.

00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:33.140
Oh, good. Okay, hold on.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.540
Okay. She's not like that, but anyways.

00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:41.540
Um, I wear this fake wedding ring sometimes...

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.660
You're a pig.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:43.900
(GROANS)

00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.660
Sorry. You're a pig.

00:14:46.780 --> 00:14:48.780
What's wrong? You're walking really weird.

00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:51.100
My back. I slept on the beach last night.

00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:52.300
God Almighty.

00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.220
When are you gonna strengthen your spine?

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.020
Seriously, Flomax.

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.020
You gotta work out more than once a month.

00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.620
I can't, I don't have time to work out.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.220
You do. You can't say that, Danny.

00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:04.460
My mother always said Cary Grant
never went to the gym.

00:15:04.580 --> 00:15:07.540
Only took the stairs, every day, never an elevator.

00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.140
You wanna hear my impression
of Cary Grant's butler? Nuh-uh.

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:11.260
Watch. What?

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:13.660
Hello? No, he's dead.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.420
Okay, bye-bye.

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.180
That's good. That's funny.

00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.540
Mom, give me some money.

00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:21.020
Hi. How are you?

00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.340
Nice to see you, kids.

00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.380
Please be polite and say hello to Dr. Maccabee.

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:25.900
(IN ENGLISH ACCENT) 'Ello, Dr. Danny.

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.420
'Ow is you today?

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:29.260
Is that my associate, Dr. Doolittle?

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:30.540
Why is she talking like that?

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:32.700
She's been working on some accents.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.940
I am takin' an acting class this summer, I is.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:38.660
Gonna be the next Miley Cyrus, I am.

00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:41.260
How 'bout you, young man? Do
you like Hannah Montana?

00:15:41.380 --> 00:15:43.260
No. I like Californication.

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.100
When do you ever watch Californication?

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.260
Rosa lets us watch Showtime
when she calls her boyfriend.

00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:52.460
Eat the mushroom! Eat the mushroom! Yes!

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.180
Mmm. You run a tight ship at home, huh?

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:56.540
MICHAEL: Dr. Danny?

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:57.860
Yeah?

00:15:57.940 --> 00:16:00.700
Will you take me to Hawaii so
I can swim with the dolphins?

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.300
Take you to Hawaii? No.

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.980
I saw a show on the Discovery Channel.

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.060
They say in Hawaii they have dolphins

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.740
that you can swim with if you pay money.

00:16:10.060 --> 00:16:11.060
Okay.

00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:13.940
But I don't have any money. And
my mom says you're rich.

00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:15.940
Michael! No, it's fine.

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:18.140
Maybe you should make your own money.

00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.300
Maybe a paper route or something like that?

00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.100
'Cause rich people don't give other people trips.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:26.220
That's why they remain rich. You understand?

00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:29.780
But my mom says you do charity for kids all the time.

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:35.260
I do charity work like I fix a cleft
lip or a child's deformity.

00:16:35.420 --> 00:16:38.380
I don't take them to Hawaii.
I could get arrested for that.

00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.820
What if I was deformed? Then
would you take me to Hawaii?

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:44.380
If you were deformed, I'd bring you to Hawaii,

00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.020
but I'd leave you there, 'cause
I wouldn't want to look at you.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.940
Okay. Here's the money, and I want change.

00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.220
And I wanna hear back

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:52.340
that you actually ate the food that I am paying for.

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.780
Mom, before we go, can I make a Devlin?

00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.500
Sure. Down the hall. Will you please go with him?

00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.340
We open in five minutes and I am
not having him sit there forever.

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.420
Bloody hell right, I will, Mumsy!

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:05.660
All right, Winston Churchill.

00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:07.100
He said, "I gotta make a Devlin."

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.020
What does that mean? Uh...

00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:12.700
It's just a friend of mine who
was in my sorority in college

00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.220
named Devlin Adams, and...

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.620
Well, I wouldn't say friend. I'd say more my nemesis.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.860
Oh, so she was a frenemy? Yes.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.660
You'd probably like her. She's really, really fake.

00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.820
Ah.

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.660
Always had to have the coolest clothes

00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:28.380
and the hottest boys and, you know...

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.620
She bothers you. A lot.

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.340
So, one night, I was just having a glass of wine.

00:17:33.460 --> 00:17:35.300
A bottle. A bottle.

00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:36.580
And, uh...

00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:39.820
And I just got so tired of the kids saying things like,

00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:41.220
"I gotta take a crap.

00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.820
"I gotta take a dump."

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.100
So, I told them that it was called "making a Devlin,"

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.580
and they liked it.

00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:48.660
And it stuck.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.140
I always call it making a black pickle.

00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.980
Making a what? I don't say that.

00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.900
Out loud? Good. To others. No.

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.900
What are we gonna do about my love life, though?

00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.180
Oh, Danny, I would feel terrible for you if I had any,

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.500

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.740
Holy Devlin, you're not listening to me.

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:10.340
This is like not some bull-Devlin fling.

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.980
I mean, I'm serious.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.580
This is the real Devlin. I could...

00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.940
I swear to God, I could see myself
ending up with this girl.

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.380
Oh.

00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:21.500
You're right. You can't tell her the truth.

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:22.780
High score!

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.740
Oh, God. Sorry.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:26.860
I'm glad someone's doing good.

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:28.140
(CHUCKLING)

00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:30.180
You know what? You don't wanna get serious,

00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:32.460
'cause when you get serious, that leads to marriage,

00:18:32.620 --> 00:18:35.100
and then marriage leads to divorce,
and divorce is just...

00:18:35.180 --> 00:18:36.260
I mean, look at these poor kids.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.900
You know, their dad was supposed
to pick them up today.

00:18:38.980 --> 00:18:40.380
He was a no-show? Again.

00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.740
But you know what?

00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:44.300
At least I got my head together and I divorced him.

00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.740
Yeah, yeah.

00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:49.380
Wait a minute.

(SCHOOL BELL RINGING)

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.780
You go ahead without me.

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:59.180
Oh, no, no, no.

Palmer, Palmer, Palmer, Palmer, Palmer.

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.260
I told you I didn't want to see you.

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:04.060
I just want to explain something to you.

00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:06.380
Let me explain something to you.

00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.780
(KIDS EXCLAIMING)

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:10.740
I do not date married men.

00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:12.580
My father cheated on my mom when I was young.

00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:14.460
I am not going to be the other woman!

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:16.500
Adulterer! Fornicator!

00:19:16.820 --> 00:19:18.780
All right, take it easy, Damien, all right?

00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.740
Okay, his name is Silas, leave him out of this.

00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:23.260
I'll kill you.

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.340
What? Anytime!

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.260
Listen! I am married.

00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:30.700
But it is a horrible marriage.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:32.500
She doesn't even talk to me anymore.

00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:34.260
Danny, that's what all married men say.

00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:36.460
If it's so bad, why don't you get divorced?

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:37.860
I am.

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:42.020
You are? Yes! It's over.

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:43.900
Oh, my God, I can't believe this.

00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.380
I destroyed a marriage!

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.660
I really feel like I'm gonna be sick. I can't...

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.740
No, no, it wasn't 'cause of you!

00:19:49.820 --> 00:19:51.820
I filed a long, long time ago.

00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:55.260
We're gonna sign the papers in a couple of days

00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.420
and it's like, she's dead to me.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:58.820
What's her name?

00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.340
Mrs. Maccabee.

00:20:01.540 --> 00:20:05.660
You mean her first name? Her first name is Devlin.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:07.900
Her name's Devlin?

00:20:08.140 --> 00:20:10.820
Isn't that a shitty name? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:14.780
But Devlin and I are splitting up, fortunately,

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:19.180
'cause I caught her cheating on me with another guy.

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.380
I didn't catch her.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:24.580
The television show Cheaters caught her and the guy.

00:20:25.540 --> 00:20:26.940
And I told them not to air it, though,

00:20:27.020 --> 00:20:29.180
because it's too painful.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.500
They actually burned the tape so you can't see it.

00:20:31.580 --> 00:20:33.220
But I would love you to.

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.220
There's another man?

00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.220
There's another guy, yes. Dolph.

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:39.860
Dolph?

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.740
Dolph Lundgren. Yeah.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.420
Like the guy from Rocky IV?

00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:47.140
No, no, a different Dolph Lundgren.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.580
Apparently, if you bring that one up,

00:20:49.660 --> 00:20:52.100
this one gets really angry, so don't.

00:20:52.260 --> 00:20:54.180
Danny, guys always say they're
gonna leave their wives.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:55.340
They never do.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.580
I'm telling you, she's happy with this Dolph guy,

00:20:57.660 --> 00:20:59.820
good for her. Now I wanna be happy.

00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:02.180
And the only way I can be happy is if I'm with you!

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:03.340
All right?

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:06.780
Just wanna be able to be with you

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:08.620
and not be called a "fornicator"

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:10.380
or an "adulterer" or whatever that

00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:12.220
Children of the Corn kid was calling me.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:13.940
Okay.

00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.100
Okay?

00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.100
I just need to hear it from her.

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.540
How about if she texts you, would that be good?

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:22.020
I need to meet her.

00:21:27.820 --> 00:21:29.220
Let's do it.

00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:31.780
KATHERINE: You want me to be
your wife? DANNY: Uh-huh.

00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:33.900
And you couldn't think of another
name, other than Devlin?

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.580
I practically took a Devlin in my
pants when she asked me.

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:37.780
"What's her name?" I got panicked.

00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.900
I get nervous around this girl.

00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:40.140
You got panicked?

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:42.380
You who invents a fake wife every Friday night?

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:43.660
Yeah. Doesn't that say something

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:44.940
about what I feel about this girl?

00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.220
Have you ever thought about the time

00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:48.140
that she's actually gonna walk
into your office... Uh-huh.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:52.300
...and sees that I'm your assistantlreceptionist?

00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:54.140
So easy. I'm a plastic surgeon,

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.580
you will never look like you again.

Snip, snap. Chip, chap. What are you talking about?

00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:59.300
I'm kidding. I'll get you a fake mustache.

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.340
Oh, my God, you've really, really
not thought this through.

00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.300
Will you please just look at some clothes?

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:07.140
Look at that. I don't wear...

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:08.620
I have clothes, by the way.

00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:10.020
I do not need to do any of this. I'm fine.

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.900
Yes. You have the best clothes that Old Navy sells.

00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:13.980
I'm just saying you gotta look
like a plastic surgeon's wife.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.460
I want to create the illusion I had a hot first wife.

00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:17.940
You're so... Not this!

How much are these? $1,700.

00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:44.100
$1,700? What, do you come with them?

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.300
My parents' house costs $1,700. No, no.

No. What, did Mickey Mantle sign those?

Why are they $1,700, they made outta panda?

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.820
Walk away. Yeah. You know what?

00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.700
We won't really be needing them anyway.

so hot. Is it warm in here?

00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.540
It's weird, she gets me very tense.

00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.140
I'm sorry to put you through this.

00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:17.700
No, I understand why we're doing this.

00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:19.820
I'm just looking forward to getting
past this part of my life

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:21.700
and moving on to the good part.

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:25.300
We will. Soon. Tonight.

00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:26.820
Good God, yes.

00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.740
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.820
Is that her?

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.820
I think so.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:54.380
She's stunning.

00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.060
I love her shoes.

00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:59.460
Yeah, well, she got about five pairs of them.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:00.700
Maybe she'll give you one.

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.620
Henderson!

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:05.860
Do you see Dr. Maccabee anywhere in this...

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.140
Oh! There he is.

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:09.860
Keep the car running, shan't be long.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.060
Hello, boring!

00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:13.860
Hey. You went with a limo driver?

00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.540
I'm just playing the part.

00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.020
Okay.

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:19.740
Palmer! Hi.

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.580
Devlin Maccabee. Soon to be, single-abee.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.420
Waiter! Excuse me. Anybody?

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:29.860
Yes, yes. Something to drink, madam?

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:31.340
Well, hello.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.420
I would like a tall glass of you.

00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.420
Is that possible? Meow!

00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:39.100
I'm just kidding. Unless you're really into it.

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.500
Kidding again. No, I'm not.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.860
We don't know. Grey Goose martinis,

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.260
just keep 'em coming. Okay. Ooh!

00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.220
Make that a dirty martini. Okay?

00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:51.460
Okay, that was a good one.

00:26:51.620 --> 00:26:54.140
Well, so, Palmer.

00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.660
I heard you and Danny had sex.

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:03.300
Yes. I am so sorry, I had...

00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:05.940
Please, honey, it is fine.

00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:09.620
I'm just happy to hear that his thing-a-ding
can still ring-a-ding.

00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:13.140
'Cause he's got a serious small issue

00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.020
with ED. Over here.

00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:17.220
Okay.

00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:18.780
What's ED? I don't...

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.980
Oh, gosh. I forgot. You're fifteen.

00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:26.140
Erectile dysfunction, my darling.

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.540
Think about it as if

00:27:27.620 --> 00:27:30.340
you're trying to throw darts and you just...

00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:32.380
All you really got, you're shooting with,

00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:33.940
like, overcooked spaghetti.

00:27:34.020 --> 00:27:35.140
Okay. Yeah.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:37.820
I just think that my spaghetti wasn't loving

00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:39.500
the meatballs that was being served.

00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:42.220
They were a little too lumpy. Oh.

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:44.900
I've heard from a lot of men that I serve

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:48.020
the finest meatballs in Southern California.

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:52.180
Of course. A lot of homeless men have said this.

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:54.740
They'll eat anything, you know.
(LAUGHS SARCASTICALLY)

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:57.180
I'm just very shocked that you remember

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:58.860
anybody you've ever been with.

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.180
With all the pills that are in your system.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:03.180
She likes the pills, this one.

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:04.940
At night I come home, "What's for dinner?"

00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:08.540
"Well, we have purple pills, and the green ones

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.180
"and some lovely yellow bombers

00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.980
"I just took out of the oven."

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:14.220
Remember that?

00:28:15.700 --> 00:28:17.900
I had to do something to amuse myself

00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.380
while this one sat on the throne for hours

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.540
dealing with his irritable bowel syndrome.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:25.580
I got another disease. Okay.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.540
Can I tell you, I spent the eve of our wedding

00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:31.020
sitting on the bed,

00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.700
listening to what sounded like
an underwater symphony,

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.940
of French horns and bassoons

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:40.740
coming out of our hotel bathroom.

00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:44.780
Mix that with the smell of like
a dead cat and some fajitas

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:47.020
and you've got what you call yourself

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.020
a severely diminished libido.

00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.460
(THUDDING) Ow!

00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:53.900
Did you just kick me?

00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:56.220
No. Did you? You kicked her?

00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.340
Why'd you kick her?

00:28:57.740 --> 00:29:00.900
Yeah, I don't... I... Yes. I... I have leg spasms.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.100
Ow!

00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:05.420
It's a side effect.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.300
Terrible side effect from all the pill popping.

00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:09.380
But, you know, it's all better now.

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:11.540
I'm clean and sober and I apologize.

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.700
It's okay.

00:29:12.780 --> 00:29:15.940
Thirteenth step, right there. Back to drinking.

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:18.340
Oh, Henderson, you thoughtless oaf,

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.820
stop texting, open that door.

00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:22.260
Why do you keep calling me
Henderson? Just go with it.

00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:24.860
Palmer, so lovely to meet you.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:26.860
Likewise, really.

00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.740
I mean, look at you two.

00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.700
I mean, it's like, Barbie and...

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.820
Yes.

00:29:33.060 --> 00:29:34.700
...Grandpa Ken.

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:36.260
(LAUGHING)

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:39.500
I mean... And even though it did not work out

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:42.260
between us at all...

00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.740
It's like it never happened. You know?

00:29:44.780 --> 00:29:45.980
It really isn't.

00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:48.460
I still want my Danny to be happy. Oh, look at that.

00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:49.740
Happy, happy, happy.

00:29:49.820 --> 00:29:50.980
Good night, kiddo. Okay.

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.460
Hello.

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:54.900
It's her drug dealer I'm thinking.

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.780
Okay, please put her on the phone right now.

00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:58.820
Are you kidding me, honey?

00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:00.540
You know how I feel about

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.500
you selling your brother's stuff on eBay.

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.620
Hey, hey, hey. Take that in the car.

00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.820
No. It's okay.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:11.660
I will deal with you when I get
home, young lady. Okay.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.100
I mean, you would think...

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:18.580
You have kids?

00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:20.900
Hmm? Hmm?

00:30:21.340 --> 00:30:22.940
You have... You have children?

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.380
We have sort of a little bit...

00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.460
A little bit of children, right?

00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.060
When were you planning on telling me

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.260
about these children, Danny?

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.620
I don't know, but listen,

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.940
I have to go get to those little munchkins.

00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:38.020
Palmer, so nice, seriously.

00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:39.140
Danny.

00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.780
No, no, no, hey, hey.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:44.340
Okay.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:49.340
Are you freaked out right now about all this or...

00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.780
Actually, just the opposite.

00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:55.780
The opposite of freaked out?
What do you mean? Good?

00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:57.180
You know that I love kids.

00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.380
I just never pegged you as a kids guy.

00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:03.220
I'm a huge kids guy. I love kids.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:04.980
Kids, kids, kids. Is...

00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:07.220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's my thing.
That's my bumper sticker.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:08.500
What are their names?

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.660
What are their names again? There is

00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:17.500
the girl who, of course, is Kiki Dee.

00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:21.140
And then the boy's name's Bart.

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.660
Which of course is short for Barto.

00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.140
Well, I wanna meet them!

00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:27.980
Of course you do.

00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:30.380
MAGGIE: So our mom doesn't
know that you took us today?

00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:31.700
Not yet.

00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:33.380
You know this is kidnapping.

00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.660
Stranger danger.

00:31:34.740 --> 00:31:36.020
What? No.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.740
Is the guy from Dateline NBC gonna walk in?

00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.220
No! I know you two a long time and Rosa's here.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.500
(SINGING)

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:47.460
Doing whatever that Rosa does.

00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.780
God, she's freaky. DANNY: Yeah.

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:50.900
So here's the deal.

00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:54.900
How would you like to be my pretend children

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.300
for one afternoon?

00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:59.380
Why don't you just tell that poor girl the truth?

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:00.540
You know?

00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:02.260
Our mother tells us everything.

00:32:02.340 --> 00:32:03.700
Wedding ring boy.

00:32:03.780 --> 00:32:04.940
What? Oh, my goodness!

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.940
Did you see Gossip Girl last night? It was so good!

00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:09.900
No, she's not like that.

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:12.220
Your mother's presenting her in a weird, weird way.

00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:13.380
I'm just saying, telling the truth

00:32:13.460 --> 00:32:14.940
is not in the cards right now.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.460
I thought you'd be excited to have an acting job.

00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:19.780
If it's an acting job, we should get paid.

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:22.300
Yeah, you're gonna get paid in experience.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.260
I wanna actually get paid.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.300
(CHUCKLES)

00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:26.700
All right, what do you want?

00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:28.740
$600 for the day,

00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:31.220
plus overtime if we go over eight hours.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.820
I'll do my own hair and makeup.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.940
And I want you to pay for the six-week
intensive acting camp

00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:37.340
that my mom can't afford.

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:42.340
$50 for the day and a two-week acting
class at the YMCA nearest you.

00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:44.940
$500 and a four- week acting class.

00:32:45.140 --> 00:32:47.460
$300 and a three-week class.

00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:48.820
Done.

00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:52.220
I would have done it for $500.

00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.340
(SCOFFS) I would have done it for the experience.

00:32:57.100 --> 00:32:59.420
Michael, you're up. Opener?

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.300
I want you to take me to Hawaii

00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.340
so I can swim with the dolphins.

00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.180
You're not gonna let that one go, are you?

00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.420
We're not going to Hawaii, pal. Anything else?

00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.540
Find someone else then.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:19.540
Ooh, the Mafia stare down. Very good, Michael.

00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:20.980
We're here to negotiate.

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:22.860
Do you have anything else you might like?

00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:24.900
I want a flying pony.

00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:27.460
I want a flying pony too, Michael, but they don't exist.

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:31.220
Then I want a regular pony. And
I want to name him Nelson.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:34.340
How about a Playstation 3 and we name him Nelson?

00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:36.220
Keep talking.

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.340
We'll include four video games.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:39.500
Five games.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:43.220
And I want the meeting with blondie
to be at J.D. McFunnigan's.

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:45.740
'cause it's right down the street from me.

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:48.660
Mention that slop-hole again and I walk.

00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:51.180
All right, take it easy, son. Take it easy.

00:33:51.460 --> 00:33:53.460
And I want unlimited tokens.

00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.020
If I can spend 'em, I wanna have 'em.

00:33:56.100 --> 00:33:57.820
I don't wanna be like playing Skee-Ball

00:33:57.900 --> 00:33:59.580
and all of a sudden run out of tokens.

00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:02.300
All right, I can make that happen.

00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.900
So do we have a deal?

00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:08.140
Deal.

Deal's off unless you eat that pizza, though. Seriously.

00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:15.620

00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:17.260
Let me hear some. 'Ello!

00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:18.860
No. Okay.

00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:21.900
My kids? Have you completely lost your mind?

00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:23.700
Are you kidding me right now?

00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.460
You're the one who picked up your cell phone.

00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:26.940
That is not...

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.260
Mrs. Harrington...

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.380
The doctor will see you now.

00:34:32.780 --> 00:34:35.300
I can't believe you're doing all of
this just so you can get some.

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.140
It's just gross. You're just pathetic.

00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:39.580
I'm not trying to get some. I already got some.

00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:41.500
And yes, I'd like to continue getting some.

I'm pro me getting some.

00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.380
Have a seat right there, Mrs. Harrington.

00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:46.180
Remove your shirt, if you could.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.820
I smell something. You smell something?

00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.220
I smell perfume.

00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:04.100
I don't have a date. I have a lunch.

00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.420
You got a lunch? Who you got a lunch with?

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:09.820

if you must know everything.

00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:10.940
His name is Brian.

00:35:11.100 --> 00:35:12.820
The guy with the gray soul patch?

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:14.260
You know what?

00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:15.780
Hey, man, I'm Brian.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:16.860
You're mean!

Wow, you wanna go to lunch sometime?

00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:20.340
Is he gonna take you there right after the big protest?

You can take the brassiere off, too.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.100
And by the way, he does play the bass.

00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:34.980
And he writes songs.

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.260
What does he write songs about,

00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:37.620
how bad his ponytail stinks?

00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:40.460
Mrs. Harrington, could you put your
hands on your hips, please?

00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.460
Okay, so, one of the funbags
is not having too much fun.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.980
All right, what happened anyways?

00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:47.860
Well, I hit it with the car door yesterday... Right.

00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:49.020
...and I heard a pop

00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:52.180
and then some sloshing sound when I walk.

00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.660
(CELL PHONE BUZZING) Yeah. I think.

00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.540
What are you doing?

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:02.500
Could be the kids or could be Brian.

Okay. Stop that.

That was my voice.

It's gonna be one afternoon.

Why are we making such a big deal out of this?

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:48.020
Because you know what? You're
trying to get my kids involved

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.420
in your dysfunctional, sick little,
pathetic, twisted web of lies.

00:36:52.540 --> 00:36:54.220
When I was negotiating with your son, Michael,

00:36:54.300 --> 00:36:57.220
he had the biggest smile I've
ever seen on anyone's face.

I'm not kidding you.

I think that's enough. Do you feel that?

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:05.780
No.

00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.900
No, but do you feel that?

00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:09.060
No. We're good.

00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:11.260
By the way, did you make this?

Mmm-hmm.

when we've done the operation. Terrific job.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:18.300
Did he really smile?

00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.300
Swear to God, like the cutest little smile.

says "No" in a scene,

the whole class yells, "Die!"

00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:55.860
You're not a whore, Palmer.

00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:57.020
Okay.

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.860
That's so nice. See what they do, they fight,

00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:00.180
then they make up and it's good.

00:42:00.340 --> 00:42:01.620
Good. We're doing good.

00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.420
(SNEEZES) Are you kidding me?

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:08.700
Got a hamburger here for Bart, Art the Water Fart.

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:09.820
Here you go, kid.

00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:11.100
Look at that, sweet!

00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:15.580
And two quesadillas for Kiki Sneaky
With a Side of Freaky.

00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.900
Here's the waters. No soda for you.

00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:21.540
You're battling diabetes, remember? Huh?

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.940
Kiki Dee?

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.900
I got you two quesadillas 'cause it's your
favorite food so you have to eat it.

00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:33.620
Well, yes! And that's why I'm going
to eat every single bit of it.

00:42:33.980 --> 00:42:35.540
All right, let's see.

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.420
Yummy!

00:42:39.580 --> 00:42:40.620
(MOUTHING) Thank you.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.620
Hey, I think we forgot napkins.

00:42:42.900 --> 00:42:44.780
We did? Okay. Well let me get the napkins.

00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.460
Because I know she's not gonna get up and do it

00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:48.060
because she doesn't like to get up and do anything.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:49.300
Oh, nice.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.940
Everybody be cool.

00:42:52.340 --> 00:42:56.660
So, Bart, your dad tells me you
like to go to the bathroom.

00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:59.660
When I feel it, I do it.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:02.140
What else do you like?

00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:03.740
I don't know.

00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:06.420
That's our Bart.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.460
He's a man of very few words.

00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:10.540
Ah. Okay.

00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.620
Maybe I'm upset.

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:15.300
Upset about me and your father dating?

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:20.060
No. You seem to make my dad
happy and that's cool, but...

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.020
But what?

00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.420
Nothing.

00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:25.580
Hey, I want you to feel comfortable

00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:26.820
telling me anything.

00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:30.260
Well, I just hate that he broke his promise to me.

00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.500
What promise?

00:43:31.580 --> 00:43:32.860
Yeah, what promise?

00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:35.860
He promised me last year that
he would take me to Hawaii

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:36.980
to swim with the dolphins.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:39.500
They have this lagoon there with dolphins

00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:40.980
and people get to swim with them.

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.140
What are you doing?

00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:44.940
But without warning, my dad canceled the trip.

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:46.660
Why would he do that?

00:43:47.020 --> 00:43:48.780
(FAKES CRYING) He met you.

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:51.260
He what?

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:53.260
No! Die!

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:56.460
No, no, no, no, no, no! I'm saying that did not...

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.860
You misread what I said.

00:43:58.940 --> 00:44:01.820
I said we have to go to Hawaii earlier.

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:05.140
Because I'm excited for all of us to hang out there.

00:44:05.220 --> 00:44:06.300
We're going to Hawaii!

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:19.140
I can't believe I let a six-year-old blackmail me.

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.580
I saw my shot and I took it.

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:22.900
You're angry at yourself

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:24.540
'cause you got us into this whole situation.

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:25.860
I did? You really did.

00:44:25.980 --> 00:44:27.700
I think old Mary Poppins with the,

00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:30.380
"You can't say no. You can't say no, Guv'nor."

00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.300
Okay, listen, my tolerance

00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:34.580
for these continued shenanigans is right here.

00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:37.060
And if it gets up to here, I'm taking my kids,

00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.980
I'm selling you out and I'm going home.

00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:42.740
I am so happy we are doing this, Danny.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:44.420
Are you kidding me? We're going to Hawaii,

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.060
we're gonna swim with dolphins.

00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.820
It's gonna be so much fun. I was just telling the squirt.

00:44:47.900 --> 00:44:49.380
And Seventeen magazine.

00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:51.220
You brought that for these guys or is that for you?

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.820
It's mine. It's my favorite.

00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:54.740
See that? Did you ever read that magazine?

00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:56.020
Thirty years ago you did.

00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.740
And hopefully we're gonna have
time together, right, sweetie?

00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:01.700
EDDIE: Wait! Wait!

00:45:01.900 --> 00:45:03.500
(EXCLAIMING IN GERMAN)

00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:05.260
Danny, wait!

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:13.420
Muffinstein, I could not stand to be without you.

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.700
(MUFFLED GROAN) Uh-oh!

00:45:14.780 --> 00:45:15.820
Is this him?

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.460
I see the Colonel von Generous
right here in front of me.

00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:20.140
Okay, I'm confused right now.

00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:22.420
I'm so sorry. I've not introduced myself,

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.940
we have talked on the phone,
but I am the Dolph Lundgren.

00:45:27.380 --> 00:45:29.460
Devlin's man-friendl love monkey.

00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:30.700
Oh, kill me now.

00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.700
Devlin said you had to stay back and work.

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.300
I did. She what said?

00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.820
Nein, nein to the work.

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.620
I will work when I am kaput.

00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.300
You know, I think this is so great

00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:41.900
of all of you, so mature.

00:45:41.940 --> 00:45:43.980
I would have loved if my parents
had done something like this

00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:45.460
when they got divorced.

00:45:45.580 --> 00:45:47.780
That's why I was thinking we
should have the man come.

00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:49.500
Yeah, I'm glad. I'm glad.

00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:51.500
It's important for the children

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.660
to see us as a unit.

00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:55.700
And also I cannot stay away from this potato pancake.

00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:58.460
She loves the schnitzel, you know what I mean?

00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:02.100
(GROANS)

00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.060
You know what? Tongue feels a little dry.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:06.500
Let's go get you some water, honey. We'll be back.

00:46:06.620 --> 00:46:08.100
That's a big tongue, big tongue.

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:10.540
Get over here, get over here. Ew!

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:11.660
What are you doing here?

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.900
I don't know, saving the day. Helping. Hello?

00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.820
Who are you talking to? What are you looking at?

00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.740
I can't see in these things.

00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:18.900
This is what you're gonna do.

00:46:18.980 --> 00:46:21.740
You're gonna tell them that you ate a
bad sauerkraut omelet for breakfast

00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:24.140
and that you are feeling like you're
sick and that you gotta go.

00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:25.900
Katherine, I can't go. Okay? Why?

00:46:26.020 --> 00:46:29.620
Because I texted a picture of my new
equipment to my ex-girlfriend.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:30.740
Oh, you're disgusting.

00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:32.620
And I forgot she's engaged to a UFC fighter.

00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:34.540
He wants to punch me in the face.

00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:36.220
I wanna punch you in the face.

00:46:36.300 --> 00:46:37.420

Mmm-hmm. So you are coming? And I am paying?

00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:46.980
Yes. Dolph has zero dollars.

Oh, here it is.

Hey, hey!

Didn't have time to make any reservations,

00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.340
but I need two rooms, please.

00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:16.580
Oh, of course.

00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.540
Unfortunately, we only have our suites left.

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:19.860
Oh, boy.

Do the Rolling Stones come and
play for me while I'm in there?

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.980
What the hell are you talking
about? Why is it so much?

00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.140
Is it made out of panda?

00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.580
I've used that somewhere else, but is it?

00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:35.460
No, but you've made some terrific suggestions

00:47:35.580 --> 00:47:36.860

I think she has the best lips I've ever seen.

They're like an inner tube and I just wanna sit on it.

00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:15.540
You know what I mean? And just, like...

00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:17.380
Do you want me to knock you out, or...

00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:20.380
No, I'm saying you should sit on her lips.

00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:44.100
Eddie used to have an afro And
pimples all over his face

00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:47.500
So he popped and he poked 'em
And Clearasil soaked 'em

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.620

Five times.

(PEOPLE CHEERING)

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:01.380
So, guys, we're here to get to know each other better.

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:02.540
Yes. Yeah.

00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:04.100
Dolph, let's start with you.

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:05.940
So, what line of work are you in?

00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:09.900
Well, Palmer, I am in sheep.

00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:13.060
I'm sorry. I don't know what you mean.

00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:16.700
I am a sheep shipper.

00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:18.220
Oh. Yes.

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.460
You know, people, they don't buy the sheep

00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.100
from the local sheepherder anymore.

00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:24.140
Really? They don't?

00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:27.780
No, they don't. They go online!

00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:29.740
Yes! They go on the Interweb,

00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.220
to my website, gotprettysheep.com.

00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:35.860
And leave this, please. Thank you.

00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:38.140
Now, people go on. They see the pictures of the sheep,

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:39.660
and they pick the ones they want.

00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:41.100
You know, it's like, "I want that one.

00:50:41.140 --> 00:50:43.380
"You know, it's very stylish. You
know, it's a stylish one."

00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.940
Goes, "Oh, no, I want the shy
one who doesn't want to baa."

00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.660
Or they buy the sassy one,

00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:51.220
who's like, "Hey, I see you, baa, baa."

00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:52.940
So, what do the people do with these sheep?

00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:56.100
Whatever they want! Sky is the limit.

00:50:56.260 --> 00:50:57.780
You know, some have them as pets.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:00.020
Some have them as security for the house.

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.460
A lot of the people...

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:03.580
The new thing is training them

00:51:03.660 --> 00:51:06.300
to fight each other in the Sheep Fight Club.

00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:09.500
Sheep Fight Clubs?

00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.500
Yes. All the sheeps, they get together.

00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:14.180
They baa, all you hear is, "Baa, baa, baa."

00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:15.780
And then you see hoof, kick, hoof, kick,

00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:17.620
hoof, kick, baa, baa, baa, baa, baa!

00:51:17.780 --> 00:51:18.940
And then he's out.

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:22.540
And that is how we met. She bought a sheep from me.

00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:24.380
Really? Why?

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.500
Children? Okay, tune out.

00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:30.540
Okay, 'cause some secrets are coming
out, all right? Some adult ones.

00:51:30.700 --> 00:51:33.460
She likes to shave the sheep

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:37.860
for the pelt for the sex, sexuals, yes.

00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:40.140
She has got a real fetish

I'm sorry, we're leaving. I can't do it. No.

It's not even here anymore! It's gone!

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.460
How about I beat him up?

00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:06.220
You can beat him up with me. It'll be fun.

make that face at me.

Well, of course he did. The iPod.

00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:54.100

got yourselves here, huh?

Because my skin is so white.
I don't like to get it burned.

00:53:08.300 --> 00:53:09.700

You look great.

You are just the same glorious Devlin that I remember.

Oh, my God, I ran into Sandra Wernick last month.

00:53:30.660 --> 00:53:33.780
The poor thing. She's already
divorced and she has a child.

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.660
She's a single mother. It's a disaster.

00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:38.340

will you just go with it, honey?

I'm fine.

Invented it. Pleasure. I heard.

00:54:03.420 --> 00:54:06.300
Devlin, I think I spoke about you with my wife

00:54:06.380 --> 00:54:08.140
in the bathroom one or two times, right?

00:54:08.180 --> 00:54:09.340
We did.

00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:10.780

So, chief, tell me, what do you do for a living?

00:54:15.340 --> 00:54:17.380
I'm also an inventor, just like you.

No. What?

Yes. Well, that, yeah.

00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.380
Touched it down.

00:54:35.540 --> 00:54:37.820
We gotta go back. We have to
run. It was great to see you.

00:54:37.980 --> 00:54:39.500
We have to get back to our kids. So...

00:54:39.820 --> 00:54:40.900
You have kids?

Mmm-hmm. Yeah, two, actually.

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:45.580
We couldn't wait to start creating lives.

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.820
And by the way, I created these children

00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.540
in the shower. Right?

00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.180

Oh. Come on, hit that. Why'd you
leave me hanging so long?

You're so clever. That's so silly.

00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.580
The four of us should get together

00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:10.940
and have dinner one night.

and kayaking down rivers

00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:15.620
(GROANS)

00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.180
Keep your eyes on the river, sweetheart.

00:57:18.380 --> 00:57:20.940
Yes. I was looking at the canyon. (GIGGLES)

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:28.940
Hey, what're you guys doing?

00:57:29.100 --> 00:57:32.420
That bridge can only handle one person at a time!

00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:33.740
(ALL SCREAMING)

00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.020
Go, go, go!

00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.260
DANNY: What'd he say? What'd you say?

00:57:38.580 --> 00:57:39.860
(SCREAMS)

00:57:39.940 --> 00:57:41.020

00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:44.300
Holy Devlin! Ow!

00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:46.300
EDDIE: Come on, let's go.

00:57:46.460 --> 00:57:49.180
Piggyback times are magical times, aren't they?

00:57:49.260 --> 00:57:51.260
Yeah, aren't they? You're warping my spine now.

00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.740
(EXCLAIMS)

00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.540
I think Kiki slipped.

00:57:57.380 --> 00:58:00.700
Oh, Father, I just love spending time with you!

00:58:02.940 --> 00:58:04.900
Oh, my God!

00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:07.700
You guys, look at this!

00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.820
KATHERINE: Oh, my God! MAGGIE: It's lovely!

00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:12.260
KATHERINE: Wow! That is unbelievable.

00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.660
I don't know about you guys,
but I am gonna go cool off.

00:58:15.820 --> 00:58:17.500
Really? There could be black pigs in there.

00:58:17.900 --> 00:58:19.380
I agree.

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:21.100
Look at that. That's terrific.

00:58:21.620 --> 00:58:24.780
Does the hotel know you took those
pillows, honey? (CHUCKLES)

00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.100
She really wears that bikini well.

00:58:28.340 --> 00:58:29.460
Yeah.

00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:32.820
You know what she'd wear well?
Dental floss and a pirate hat.

00:58:33.020 --> 00:58:34.620
Don't say that. Absolutely gross.

00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.420
EDDIE: Oh, my God! Gorgeous!

00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:39.620
KATHERINE: Perfect.

00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.780
That was a ten! A perfect ten! Yay!

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:45.940
So, Al Jolson, you mind jumping in the water

00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:48.300
and also screaming on the way
down, "I love my daddy"?

00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:49.860
Okay.

00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.660
Yeah, do it, do it for me.

00:58:51.860 --> 00:58:53.300
Do it for Da-da. KATHERINE: I love my daddy.

00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:55.460
Daddy is my favorite adult!

00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.660
(WHOOPS) You're paying her enough for this, right?

00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:01.700
And I love you, my little British crumpet!

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.500
All right, homeboy, you're up next. Let's go.

00:59:04.660 --> 00:59:06.260
Come up with something on your own.

00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:09.700
You gotta squeeze out another log?

00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.540
What happened? What'd he whisper to you?

00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:13.500
Water's too deep.

00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:15.060
Water's too deep for what?

00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:16.340
He can't swim.

00:59:16.820 --> 00:59:18.420
He can't swim?

00:59:18.780 --> 00:59:21.260
And you wanna swim with the dolphins?

00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.180
That makes a lot of sense.

00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:25.460
Hadn't thought it through.

00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:27.300
No kidding you didn't think it through.

00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:29.220
Thought about spending all my
money, though, didn't you?

00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.740
Danny! I'm saying, I'm not the kid's...

00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:34.180
Okay. No one taught you how to swim, huh?

00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:37.900
Well, my dad's supposed to, but he's busy.

00:59:38.180 --> 00:59:40.140
Uh-huh. Busy being an idiot.

00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.900
You guys have to come in, the water feels magical!

00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.660
I got something magical, too.
Right in the downstairs area.

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.420
I don't high-five when it's...

01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:01.700
Downstairs area!

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:03.500
No, put it away. Sorry. No, stop.

01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:06.500
You know what? I think Mommy's gonna
explore the magical waters.

01:00:06.580 --> 01:00:08.580
Honey, are you okay to hang
out here with fake Daddy?

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.260
Sure.

01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:11.900
Really? You're gonna get undressed?

01:00:11.980 --> 01:00:12.980
What are you doing?

01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:14.740
What? You got a bathing cap, too?

01:00:14.860 --> 01:00:16.020
You're the worst.

01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:19.060
A 1920s swimming gown on, honey?

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.340
Don't do it. Don't take it off.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.420
Yeah. I have to be alone.

01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:38.740
Okay.

01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:44.580
God, I gotta start taking the stairs more.

01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.780
Don't buy that line.

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:48.220
She takes spinning classes like they're M&M's.

01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:56.820
I think he's wearing my underwear.

01:00:59.220 --> 01:01:00.380
What is he doing?

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:02.740
Yo, I guarantee you fall!

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:04.260
I'm all set.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.580
(EXCLAIMING)

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:08.060
Ow!

01:01:08.420 --> 01:01:09.820
Thank you, God.

01:01:13.300 --> 01:01:14.940
I wanna climb Palmer Mountain,

01:01:14.980 --> 01:01:16.740
so what do you say we get rid of these kids?

01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:19.460
No. They had them last night. It's our turn.

01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.980
Isn't that how things work? We alternate?

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:23.500
What? No.

01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:26.460
I get the kids... I had them today.

01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:27.860
That counted as a "me" day

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.060
and then she gets them at night.

01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:30.340
That's how we do it. Oh.

01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:33.100
Dolph, Devlin, do you want us to watch the kids

01:01:33.180 --> 01:01:35.260
so that you guys can have a little alone time?

01:01:35.580 --> 01:01:37.500
I don't think... Yes! Absoshnutely!

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:38.860
We are sleeping together!

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:40.780
You guys have your own beds and it's our time!

01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:43.500
So we're gonna watch them. Good.

01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:46.940
You guys wanna come take a look at the balcony?

01:01:46.980 --> 01:01:48.140
I think I saw some dolphins around here.

01:01:48.260 --> 01:01:51.500
Dolphins? Hey, he loves those, right? Dolphins.

01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:52.700
Sorry. Okay, go.

01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:54.140
All right, let go. Come on.

01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:55.620
Get the dolphins. Bye, you guys.

01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.380
That's why we're here, the dolphins.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:01:58.540
See you out there.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:00.140
Listen, if anything happens

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:01.780
and you need any... And I mean anything,

01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.020
you have to call me.

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.620
I'm good at this, I swear to you.

01:02:04.700 --> 01:02:06.820
I used to baby-sit Eddie when we were children.

01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.260
Eddie is your fault? No, no, no.

01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:11.140
But I want you to enjoy tonight.

01:02:11.220 --> 01:02:12.300
Come on, it's like a free night.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.820
You can do whatever you want.

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:15.740
You can knit yourself some socks

01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:17.740
or shock people with your sneaky hot body.

01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:19.540
I don't know what you're talking about. Cary Grant?

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.020
I'm just gonna sit in my room

01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:23.660
and worry about you and them and everything.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:25.580
What about just hang out platonically

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:27.300
with Eddie tonight? Have some dinner?

01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.740
Or is he not good enough?

01:02:28.820 --> 01:02:31.820
You need Brian, the guy from Foghat, around here.

01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:33.220
That really bothered you

01:02:33.260 --> 01:02:35.180
that I went to lunch with that guy.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:36.820
What do you mean, you went to lunch with him?

01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:38.860
I told you I was going to lunch with him.

01:02:39.020 --> 01:02:40.740
I thought it was he asked you to lunch

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:42.060
and you were gonna like scoff at it.

01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.500
But you did? You fell for his charms?

01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:47.340
I don't even understand what this is.

01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.740
It's the beard, man.

01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:50.140
It doesn't move!

01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:53.020
Well, yeah, in the wind, man. It's flapping around.

01:02:53.180 --> 01:02:54.660
All right. You know what? I'll tell you this.

01:02:54.740 --> 01:02:57.260
The guy made it through an entire lunch with a woman

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:58.980
without making up a fake life.

01:02:59.420 --> 01:03:00.620
Ah.

01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.380
You just hurt me.

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.540
That was not nice, but it was the truth.

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.700
And I speak the truth.

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:09.420
Please pay attention to my children.

01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.660
Everything will be nice.

01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:13.540
They serve room service in the hallway.

01:03:13.940 --> 01:03:16.060
I'm so nauseous. Okay. Bye.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.340
Alone at last!

01:03:21.460 --> 01:03:22.740
(WHIMPERING)

01:03:23.980 --> 01:03:25.180
(COUGHS)

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:27.820
Let's play the game.

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:29.940
We were doing so good with the game.

01:03:30.780 --> 01:03:34.620
"If you could be one person besides yourself,

01:03:34.900 --> 01:03:36.020
"who would you be?"

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.820
Rachael Ray, because I've always

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:39.900
wanted to know how to cook.

01:03:39.980 --> 01:03:41.740
Really? Oh, she's darling.

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:44.500
You know what? I don't really wanna be anyone else.

01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.260
I'm happy with who I am. I choose me.

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:49.620
Or Captain Kirk. Either one.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:51.500
See, that's a good one. All right.

01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:52.820
What about you, Bart?

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:55.900
Mr. DeCesare.

01:03:56.260 --> 01:03:58.300
Our mailman? Why?

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:02.340
He just seems like he's got it all figured out.

01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:04.140
We're getting deep.

01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:07.460
Okay, moving on. Uh...

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:11.260
Okay. "Name something that makes you sad."

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:17.100
That Judi Dench has never won
the Oscar for Best Actress.

01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.900
(CRYING) It's a travesty.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:23.260
That 'N Sync broke up.

01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.660
Yeah. That was rough on all of us.

01:04:27.180 --> 01:04:28.940
(SOFTLY) Who's 'N Sync?

01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:32.140
Sadness. Bart, you're up.

01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:35.340
I don't wanna say mine.

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:37.260
Okay. Let's move on then.

01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:38.500
Hey!

01:04:38.620 --> 01:04:40.780
Honey, come on. You can share anything with us.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:41.980
Yeah, share.

01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.780
He looks like he's about to lose it, but okay.

01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:48.140
When my dad doesn't have time for me.

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:50.460
Come on, it's okay.

01:04:50.660 --> 01:04:53.700
We're okay. We're okay. It's fine.

01:04:53.780 --> 01:04:56.460
It's all gonna be okay. Come on.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.660
We don't need him in our lives.

01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.140
Wow.

01:05:00.220 --> 01:05:01.540
No, no, no, he's...

01:05:01.620 --> 01:05:02.860
MAGGIE: We're okay. It's fine.

01:05:03.020 --> 01:05:04.460
It's all gonna be okay.

01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:06.500
This has nothing to...

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.900
This is, like, from a long time ago!

01:05:10.300 --> 01:05:11.980
It's okay.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.820
What are you doing?

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.580
DANNY: Well, that was a major setback.

01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.660
"When my dad doesn't have time
for me." (IMITATES CRYING)

01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:22.620
We're sorry.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:23.860
I know you're sorry.

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.700
I know you got real stuff going on with your family.

01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:27.060
And it's painful.

01:05:27.140 --> 01:05:29.020
But you gotta just hold it in

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:30.700
till you get to the mainland again.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:32.020
You're the ones who wanted to come here

01:05:32.100 --> 01:05:33.260
and go swimming with the dolphins

01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:35.500
or standing with the dolphins because you can't swim.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:37.700
Can you act professional? BOTH: Yes, sir.

01:05:37.740 --> 01:05:39.900
For at least two more days, until I kill you off

01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:42.060
in a boarding school train accident?

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:43.900
I thought it was a car accident.

01:05:44.060 --> 01:05:45.060
I don't know. Either that

01:05:45.140 --> 01:05:46.500
or a science explosion, just something.

01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:48.820
You're gonna be dead soon. That's
the good news. Okay?

01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:51.100
So, can you just focus for a few more days?

01:05:51.220 --> 01:05:52.540
BOTH: Yes. Good.

01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:55.220
So, give me some fake hugs right
now and laugh real loud

01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.580
like we're the happiest family on earth.

01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:58.220
Okay. Is that possible?

01:05:58.380 --> 01:06:00.780
And laughing, laughing, laughing.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:03.380
Okay, that's it. Laugh louder, louder.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.820
(LAUGHING LOUDLY)

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:07.340
DANNY: I love you guys!

01:06:07.420 --> 01:06:09.900
Hey, sweetie! What's going on? What's up?

01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:13.100
So, kids, I just got off the phone with your mom

01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:15.780
and you guys are gonna have plenty of time

01:06:15.860 --> 01:06:17.300
to spend with your dad tomorrow

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:20.540
because she and I are gonna
have a nice, long spa day.

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.700
ALL: Aw!

01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:24.780
Awesome! Awesome, awesome.

01:06:24.980 --> 01:06:26.820
You guys are so...

01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:29.860
I'll see you in a minute, okay? I love you.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.180
(KIDS EXCLAIMING)

01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:35.060
Okay, he's losing it. Okay, good night.

01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:36.220
He's losing it.

01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.300
DANNY: All right, here we go. Everybody out.

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.780
So, what are we doing?

01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:45.300
Palmer forgot her camera in the room

01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.860
so I'm gonna have a surprise for her

01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.340
when she gets back from the spa.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:49.780
MAGGIE: A stolen camera?

01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.420
No, some pictures of us having a great time

01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.140
reassuring her of all the fun we have together.

01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:59.180
I forgot to flush the toilet before I left the hotel.

01:06:59.580 --> 01:07:01.020
So she's gonna have two surprises.

01:07:01.060 --> 01:07:04.300
Okay. No one's supposed to crap as much as you do.

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.660
You gotta look into that Pepto Bismol or something.

01:07:06.820 --> 01:07:08.940
Here's your putters. Bing.

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:10.860
And a bam. Thank you.

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.940
Let's just look right in the camera.
And we're having fun.

01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:15.940
And we're a family. We love each other.

01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:17.820
And boo! (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:20.620
All right, let's do the old Michael-hit-a-putt shot. Okay?

01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:22.660
So boom, that's in the hole.

01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:23.940
And you're excited about that,

01:07:24.020 --> 01:07:27.060
and we're happy for him, and...
(EXCLAIMS) (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:29.500
Maggie just hit the ball, but you
followed through too much

01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.020
and it made you fall on your back.

01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.460
Okay, but... Look at this.

01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:34.780
You're laughing, but I'm a concerned
father, so I'm like,

01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:36.740
"Oh, my God." (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.660
All right, now,

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.820
let's just laugh at something I
say, because I'm a funny dad.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.860
You're very close with me, and
you think I'm funny, and...

01:07:43.020 --> 01:07:44.260
Why are we always laughing?

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.660
Is there something wrong with us?

01:07:46.140 --> 01:07:48.660
No. You're just amused by everything
I say. So, here we go.

01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.220
Can we take a break? Do something really fun?

01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:53.020
No, we're not doing anything fun, man.

01:07:53.100 --> 01:07:54.700
We're here to fake having fun.

01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:55.940
Come on. Right to the camera.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:58.900
Don't worry. We never have
fun with our real dad either.

01:07:59.900 --> 01:08:01.500
Oh, man.

01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.220
(SIGHS) All right. How's this?

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:05.820
I'll teach you how to swim, okay?

01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:07.660
Before your mother gets back

01:08:07.740 --> 01:08:10.220
from the "spa day" in four hours?

01:08:10.380 --> 01:08:12.060
Is that even possible? Yeah.

01:08:12.180 --> 01:08:13.980
But we're gonna take one more
picture, if you don't mind.

01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:16.340
Make that two pictures. Maggie.

01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:19.140
Throw this straight in the air. Make it look like...

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.900
On the count of three, one, two,
three. (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.060
Okay.

01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:23.700
Now, Michael, lay down.

01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.660
On your back. And...

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.180
Yeah, all the way over. See if you can clench this.

01:08:29.260 --> 01:08:31.100
Now look like you're in pain.

01:08:31.180 --> 01:08:32.580
DANNY: Ooh! (SHUTTER CLICKS)

01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:37.940
It took my friend a whole summer
to learn how to swim.

01:08:38.340 --> 01:08:39.660
How're you gonna teach me so quick?

01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:42.260
I'm gonna do it the same way
my grandfather taught me.

01:08:42.620 --> 01:08:43.820
(EXCLAIMS)

01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:47.620
Don't worry.

01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.820
It took Grandpa eight hours to teach us.

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:50.900
It was a nightmare.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:53.860
But there's two of us here now, and we're sober.

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.300
You're gonna be fine.

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:57.580
All right. You're doing great.

01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.420
Is he doing great? He's doing great.

01:08:59.540 --> 01:09:01.100
Okay. We want to advance a little, though.

01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:03.100
I need you to swim to Uncle Eddie.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.700
If you get there without touching the bottom,

01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:06.100
we'll give you a dolphin cookie.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.620
(MIMICKING DOLPHIN)

01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:10.060
Is that what your grandpa gave you?

01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:13.220
No, Grandpa gave us something he'd call a Heineken.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:14.300
I want one of those.

01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.620
No. Stick with the dolphin cookie.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:18.460
Yeah. They hurt less when they
get thrown at your head.

01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:20.060
God, he was a sick man.

01:09:20.140 --> 01:09:22.460
Yeah. Okay? Are we ready?

01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:23.900
Don't think about it. Commit. Kick, kick.

01:09:23.940 --> 01:09:25.740
Get the cookie. Move your feet.

01:09:27.500 --> 01:09:28.940
Kick, kick!

01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:30.940
Right there! Reach for it! You got it!

01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:32.140
Doing good, buddy!

01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.260
There you go!

01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.420
My boy! That was terrific, buddy.

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.980
Have your cookie. We're gonna move on, though.

01:09:40.100 --> 01:09:41.380
PALMER: Hey, Devlin?

01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.500
Devlin? Yeah?

01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.860
So, Danny's birthday is next week,

01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:48.540
and I have no idea what to get him.

01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:50.060
(GROANS)

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.140
Well, don't get him a tie.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.380
He has 100 of them and he never wears them.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.540
That's good to know.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:58.940
He loves books on tape for his car.

01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:00.220
Fishing gear.

01:10:00.740 --> 01:10:02.940
Loves it. Doesn't use it.

01:10:03.020 --> 01:10:04.500
Can't take the fish off of the hook

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.500
once he catches it, so he just collects it.

01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:10.540
He loves candy. Jelly Bellies. Loves them, his favorite.

01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:12.620
But he only likes the Cotton Candy
and the Peanut Butter.

01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:14.820
So you have to buy the bag of the Jelly Bellies,

01:10:14.900 --> 01:10:16.460
separate the Cotton Candy and the Peanut Butter

01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:17.620
and put them into a little...

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.620
It's a kind of Ziploc baggies that I got online.

01:10:19.700 --> 01:10:21.660
You know so much about him.

01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:23.820
Yeah.

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:26.740
I've known the guy forever.

01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:30.700
Music. Loves music.

01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:33.060
But anything after '95, don't bother.

01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:34.340
You'll lose him.

01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:36.740
That's when I finished my Girl Scouts.

01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.580
All right. How many cookies do we got left?

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.580
Maybe about forty!

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.380
What do you think, 40 feet for 40 cookies?

01:10:45.420 --> 01:10:47.180
Can you handle that? You need a little rest?

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:48.340
Let's do this.

01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:51.420
Really? Okay, he's ready! He's ready to rock!

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:52.820
Almost.

01:10:53.180 --> 01:10:54.220
What? No.

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:58.220
Oh, my! Ladies and gentlemen, off come the floaties!

01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.220
This is getting serious!

01:11:00.300 --> 01:11:01.460
Are you sure about this, Michael?

01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:03.260
Hell, yeah. All right.

01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:05.420
No matter what, you're a good man, okay?

01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:07.780
Keep kicking. I'm here if you need me.

01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:08.900
You got this.

01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.540
Go! Go, Michael!

01:11:10.740 --> 01:11:12.180
DANNY: Go! Breathe! Yeah!

01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:13.860
Kick it! Go!

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.380
Move your arms! Yeah!

01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.980
(ALL CHEERING)

01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:18.700
He doesn't have floaties on!

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.380
Oh, my God!

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:21.780
DANNY: Get the cookies!

01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:23.700
KATHERINE: Come on, sweetheart! You've got it!

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:24.820
A little bit more, little bit more.

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.540
Swim! Swim! KATHERINE: Oh, my God!

01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:30.980
EDDIE: Come on! Just a little bit more!

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:33.900
Keep going, Michael! Don't give up!

That's my boy! Yeah, buddy!

01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:48.220
I did it! I did it! Thank you!

01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.940
No way, that was you, buddy.

01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:52.500
That was awesome. Way to go!

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.100
What are we looking at?

01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:04.940
Jeez. Oh, God. Devlin. (GROANS)

01:12:05.980 --> 01:12:08.940
Devlin. Oh, God. You snuck up on me.

01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:10.700
Did I? Oh... Yes.

01:12:10.900 --> 01:12:13.380
Do you startle easily? That's a sign of menopause.

01:12:13.460 --> 01:12:14.460
Hmm...

01:12:14.540 --> 01:12:16.100
Devlin?

01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:18.340
Palmer Dodge, this is Devlin.

01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.500
She and I went to college together.

This is Palmer Dodge. DEVLIN: Aloha, Palmer.

01:12:23.980 --> 01:12:25.500
Is this your daughter?

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:29.340
No, no, no. I'm actually the girlfriend.

01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:30.500
Whose girlfriend?

01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:33.020
Yes, hi. (GREETS IN GERMAN)

Danny is in the water teaching
our little boy how to swim.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.700
He was so sweet.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:48.020
You know what's so crazy is that
I have never met anybody

01:12:48.140 --> 01:12:49.500
with the first name Devlin before.

01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:52.220
You know, and here you are, and
your name's Devlin and...

01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:45.020
I don't understand. Why would you say yes?

01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.900
Because I didn't know, I didn't say no.

01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:50.660

So, today, you know, with Dolph
pushing me in the pool.

Well, I'd like to start off by saying

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:56.660
Would you stop it?

01:30:56.700 --> 01:30:57.860
Smells good. Come on, let's go.

01:30:57.980 --> 01:30:59.980
Have you got it to your mouth yet, Boo-Boo?

01:31:00.140 --> 01:31:03.700
Stop putting your ass in my face.

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:06.300

01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:24.140
Great teamwork, guys.

01:31:24.220 --> 01:31:25.580
How long have you two been married?

01:31:25.700 --> 01:31:27.420
Eight years. Ten years.

01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:28.900
Ten years. Eight.

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:30.700
Very long time. A very long time.

01:31:31.020 --> 01:31:31.060
KATHERINE: Did you see the look
on her face? DANNY: Yes.

01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:33.140
KATHERINE: Did you see the look
on her face? DANNY: Yes.

01:31:33.220 --> 01:31:35.380
Do you understand what joy that brought me?

01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:36.820
How about the look on her face

01:31:36.900 --> 01:31:38.140
when you were doing the juggling, though?

01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:39.540
The juggling was the highlight for me.

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:41.100
That was pretty good. You liked that?

01:31:41.180 --> 01:31:42.260
It was so cute.

01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:44.580
And when you talked about her arms getting done?

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:46.420
The good news is she's beating the hell

01:31:46.500 --> 01:31:47.700
out of the iPod guy right now.

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:48.900
Right now, I know.

01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:52.500
That was good. That was really fun.

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:55.180
You know what, I think that was the first time

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:56.700
that you and I have ever

01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:01.060
gone out, you know, just us.

01:32:01.220 --> 01:32:02.540
I know. I do.

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:04.220
I feel bad for the Soul Patch now.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:05.940
I do.

01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.540
Now that you've been out with a real man.

01:32:07.700 --> 01:32:09.980
And by a real man, I mean a man who showers.

01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:11.620

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:14.980
I think it's so adorable

01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:17.540
how obsessed you are with this guy.

01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:19.820
I just can't picture you guys on
a date, you know what I mean?

01:32:20.020 --> 01:32:21.700
Who said it was a date ever?

01:32:21.900 --> 01:32:23.220
You. You.

01:32:23.420 --> 01:32:25.540
You get very excited when you talk to this man.

01:32:25.660 --> 01:32:29.580
Listen, Dr. Gervitz is moving his
practice to New York City.

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:30.740
Yeah.

01:32:30.820 --> 01:32:33.380
Brian is not gonna go with him, and he...

01:32:33.620 --> 01:32:36.260
He's just been asking me if

01:32:37.100 --> 01:32:40.260
I would want to, you know, replace him.

01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:42.100
You're going?

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:43.900
No.

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:45.740
You can't do that to me.

01:32:45.900 --> 01:32:47.900
I just wanted to see how you'd react.

01:32:47.980 --> 01:32:50.260
Look at you. You can't live without me.

"What do I do? How do I sign it?

01:32:51.900 --> 01:32:53.220
"How do I pay for it?"

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:56.140
No. You kind of played with me a little bit, though.

01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:58.940
You could've told me that earlier.

01:32:59.020 --> 01:33:00.460
You're just messing with me?

01:33:00.540 --> 01:33:02.300
Trying to get me a little jealous, weren't you?

01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:05.260
No. I just was having fun teasing you.

01:33:05.460 --> 01:33:07.900
That was fun. Why? Were you jealous?

01:33:08.420 --> 01:33:11.740
No. Get outta here. Was I jealous? No.

01:33:11.820 --> 01:33:15.540
Look at you. You're grinning, you
can't stop, what is that smile?

01:33:15.620 --> 01:33:17.100
I didn't know you had that many teeth.

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:19.900
I know. I got like 55 teeth.

01:33:19.980 --> 01:33:21.340
(BOTH LAUGHING)

01:33:21.820 --> 01:33:23.540
No. So there's nothing?

01:33:24.140 --> 01:33:26.300
You and... There's nothing?

01:33:26.620 --> 01:33:27.780
No love connection?

01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:30.180
No. Mmm-mmm. Nothing.

01:33:30.300 --> 01:33:32.340
Well, then, that's a shame.

01:33:32.540 --> 01:33:33.580
What?

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:36.660
That coconut getting in the way tonight.

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:38.100
That's a shame, don't you think? Oh.

01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:39.820
No. No, that was bad.

01:33:40.020 --> 01:33:41.060
The coconut.

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:42.300
You're lucky that coconut was there.

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:45.460
You couldn't... You wouldn't
have been able to handle it.

01:33:45.820 --> 01:33:47.300
Maybe you're right.

01:33:50.340 --> 01:33:53.140
You got more tricks that I don't know about?

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:54.420
I don't know.

01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:55.660
Okay.

01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:58.060
I don't know anything.

01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.340
it's like a Hawaiian Rosa, huh?

Is it? Oh, my God.

Where were you guys?

01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:33.740
I was looking for you guys at...

What happened? How was the dinner?

01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:40.100
Dolph gave mouth- to-mouth to a sheep.

01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.740
Yeah. And then we had a few drinks.

01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:45.980
Yes. It was choking and so I gave him sheep-P-R.

But he was the black sheep of the family,

01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:54.620
but he was also white, if that makes any sense.

01:35:55.420 --> 01:35:57.900
And we've been talking about how
amazing this trip has been

01:35:57.980 --> 01:35:59.860
and how amazing you are.

01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:01.460
Yeah, all joking aside,

01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:03.300
it really has been first-class.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:06.500

01:36:13.180 --> 01:36:15.780
Uh... Yeah, you told her about that?

01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:18.940
I don't need you to get me a ring, Danny.

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:22.940

Why not? We're in Hawaii. Let's do it tomorrow.

I mean, this has felt special from
the moment that we met.

imagined my husband would be.

between you and me at the office, so...

01:41:01.780 --> 01:41:04.300
Well, you're not gonna have to worry about that.

01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:08.460
You going to New York?

01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:11.660
Yeah. I just, you know, I mean...

01:41:12.300 --> 01:41:15.140
As much as I was looking forward to you, um,

01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:18.380
reconstructing my face,

01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:22.820
I really just need to start fresh, you know?

01:41:25.620 --> 01:41:27.460
Hello, are you there?

01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:29.940
You understand?

01:41:31.140 --> 01:41:32.620
I guess.

01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.980
It's an awful lot of guessing
coming through this phone.

01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:40.340
I've been divorced, I have two kids,

01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:42.340
I don't have time for guessing.

01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:48.740
Got a big day tomorrow, Doc, all right?

01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:51.740
So why don't you just get yourself some sleep?

01:42:06.180 --> 01:42:08.340
So that's it. You have nothing else to worry about.

01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.540
We have the flowers, the music and the location,

01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:12.940
which is ha-wowie, by the way, you're gonna love it.

01:42:13.100 --> 01:42:15.220
I promise you it is going to be

01:42:15.340 --> 01:42:18.260
the most wonderful day of your life, guaranteed.

01:42:18.500 --> 01:42:20.260
Devlin. Yeah.

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:21.620
Oh! Palmer! I didn't...

01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:29.620
Well, you just look absolutely beautiful.

01:42:30.220 --> 01:42:32.100
Really? Thank you. Yes.

01:42:32.860 --> 01:42:34.380
Devlin, can I ask you something?

01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:35.540
'Course.

01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.780
Do you still want to be with Danny?

01:42:40.380 --> 01:42:41.460
Wait. What?

01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:43.100
Because I think that

01:42:44.900 --> 01:42:48.140
he still may be in love with you.

01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:50.860
Really?

01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:55.060
Why would you think that?

01:42:55.540 --> 01:42:58.540
He's always glowing when you're around.

01:42:58.700 --> 01:43:01.980
And he laughs at your jokes. He doesn't laugh at mine.

01:43:02.140 --> 01:43:06.540
Palmer, trust me, there is nothing
between me and Danny.

01:43:06.820 --> 01:43:08.580
We're just, you know,

01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:10.380
we're familiar.

01:43:11.820 --> 01:43:13.580
And you are the girl for him.

01:43:14.580 --> 01:43:16.060
He even told me that last night.

01:43:16.740 --> 01:43:19.740
My God, Devlin, this is such a relief

01:43:20.100 --> 01:43:23.740
because I could never stand a
chance going up against you.

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.780
Turn around. Tell me if this fits.

01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:27.980
Put the hanger up your nose.

01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:29.180
(LAUGHS) Stop!

01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:41.460
Excuse me.

01:43:41.620 --> 01:43:43.020
Here you go. Thank you.

01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:44.460
Katherine!

01:43:44.700 --> 01:43:46.140
Katherine! Oh, Devlin.

01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:47.940
That was so much fun last night.

01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.100
I know.

01:43:49.460 --> 01:43:52.460
I am still trying to work out how you cheated.

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:55.540
I didn't. That's what happened.

01:43:55.780 --> 01:43:57.980
So, where's Danny?

01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:01.300
Devlin...

01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.100
Danny's at his wedding.

01:44:05.620 --> 01:44:06.780
Come again?

01:44:06.940 --> 01:44:08.460
I was never married to him.

01:44:09.820 --> 01:44:11.660
All a big lie that I made up.

01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:13.060
Why?

01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:18.300
'Cause I couldn't stand the thought
of you knowing the truth.

01:44:18.340 --> 01:44:19.460
Really?

01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:22.620
So, yeah, I'm a single mother.

01:44:23.180 --> 01:44:24.700
I have two kids that I love

01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:26.180
more than anything in the world.

01:44:26.340 --> 01:44:30.220
I drive a Honda. Still have dial-up internet.

01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:34.500
I got a 2.7 GPA in college, not a 3.4.

01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:36.500
And while I'm at it telling the truth,

01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.700
I named my kids' poop after you.

01:44:40.860 --> 01:44:43.300
And I work for Danny. I'm his assistant.

01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:44.500
That's it.

01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:48.300
Really, I would never have guessed this.

01:44:48.340 --> 01:44:50.140
I mean, you two had a real connection.

01:44:51.340 --> 01:44:54.820
He's great. He's the greatest guy.

01:44:56.780 --> 01:44:59.420
And I might even be in love with him,

01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:02.420
but that doesn't really matter at this moment

01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:06.900
because he is getting married
to another person right now.

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.020
lan and I are breaking up.

01:45:11.860 --> 01:45:15.060
What? What happened?

01:45:16.380 --> 01:45:18.540
Well, for starters, he's gay.

01:45:18.700 --> 01:45:19.820
He's gay?

01:45:19.900 --> 01:45:21.460
I mean, look at him.

01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:23.620
That's a strong muscle right there.

01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:25.180
I'm squeezing.

01:45:25.740 --> 01:45:27.140
Devlin, I gotta tell you,

01:45:27.220 --> 01:45:30.100
last night, with the ass grab of the coconut,

01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:32.180
little bit of a red flag.

01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:33.780
(LAUGHS)

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:35.900
I've seen him do that with the soap.

01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:37.260

What about the iPod?

01:45:44.380 --> 01:45:46.060
Oh, he didn't invent shit.

01:45:46.140 --> 01:45:47.380
He didn't?

01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:50.100
No! He made his money suing the Dodgers

01:45:50.180 --> 01:45:52.300
after he got hit by a foul ball.

01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:57.100
Oh, God! That's so... What?

01:45:58.100 --> 01:45:59.740
Well, this is different.

01:46:00.060 --> 01:46:04.820
Yeah, why didn't we try this truth-telling thing before?

01:46:05.420 --> 01:46:06.660
I don't know.

01:46:07.740 --> 01:46:09.380
Hey. Hey.

01:46:10.660 --> 01:46:11.660
What?

01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:12.980
That's nice.

01:46:13.060 --> 01:46:15.260
It's nice to tell the truth. That's good.

01:46:15.460 --> 01:46:16.860
The truth is fun, isn't it?

01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:18.420
Like, were you telling the truth

01:46:18.460 --> 01:46:20.180
when you said you might be in love with me?

01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:22.740
I'm gonna leave you two. Okay.

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.780
I'm gonna go get a divorce. Good luck.

01:46:26.580 --> 01:46:27.900

01:46:30.300 --> 01:46:32.740
Wait, where are my kids?

01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:35.580
Palmer took them out for ice cream.

01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:38.700
So, how was the wedding?

01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:40.140
Okay. All right.

01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:44.180
So, we're standing on top of this beautiful cliff. Uh-huh.

01:46:44.300 --> 01:46:47.540
I start looking out into the Pacific,

01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:49.180
and I think to myself,

01:46:49.300 --> 01:46:54.060
"Wow. I am about to start my life

01:46:54.660 --> 01:46:56.180
"with the one I love."

01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:59.940
And the only problem was,

01:47:00.020 --> 01:47:02.460
the one I love was not with me.

01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:04.860
She wasn't?

01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:06.140
She was not.

01:47:07.140 --> 01:47:08.940
So you didn't?

01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:10.340
I couldn't.

01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.620
You couldn't.

01:47:12.220 --> 01:47:16.620
I mean, don't we have something extra

01:47:16.660 --> 01:47:18.020
happening with us?

01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:21.340
Danny, I...

What happens when we're not on fake-cation

01:47:27.060 --> 01:47:30.260
and you wake up and realize this is real?

01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:33.340
You are the only real thing I've ever had in my life.

01:47:33.540 --> 01:47:35.700
Danny, come on, man. I don't...

01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:38.900
She's beautiful and she's... I'm not twenty-three.

01:47:40.700 --> 01:47:42.660
I'm not that.

01:47:42.860 --> 01:47:44.780
She's good, she's very nice,

01:47:44.820 --> 01:47:47.540
there's only one problem. She's not you.

01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:48.860
She's not you.

01:47:49.860 --> 01:47:51.540
I have two kids.

01:47:51.860 --> 01:47:55.220
