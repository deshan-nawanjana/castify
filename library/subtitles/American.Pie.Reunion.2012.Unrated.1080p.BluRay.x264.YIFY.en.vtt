00:12:59.052 --> 00:13:03.510
And you will learn about the
... masturbation ...

177
00:13:03.677 --> 00:13:05.759
You know, all the "must"
and "should not"

178
00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.718
that has to do
with the bird.

179
00:13:07.719 --> 00:13:08.427
All right.

180
00:13:08.635 --> 00:13:10.884
I hope by then to have
developed and other ...

181
00:13:10.885 --> 00:13:13.469
All right. I understand ...

182
00:13:14.802 --> 00:13:17.800
You know, it is still
two years, so

183
00:13:17.801 --> 00:13:20.925
I will not
talking about his penis.

184
00:13:20.926 --> 00:13:22.758
- How are you, Dad?
- Well.

185
00:13:22.759 --> 00:13:24.299
Yes? What to do
time passes you?

186
00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:26.384
Do you see any new
film of the SMP;

187
00:13:26.926 --> 00:13:30.343
You know your mother and
I saw many films.

188
00:13:34.176 --> 00:13:36.884
3 years passed after she died.

189
00:13:39.093 --> 00:13:41.884
Certainly there will be a
to watch movies together.

190
00:13:42.176 --> 00:13:45.384
I've got you now, go and see
together a movie tonight, me and you.

191
00:13:45.676 --> 00:13:49.216
Tonight? Difficult, because I have arranged
with children.

192
00:13:49.217 --> 00:13:51.382
To meet them tonight,
the bar, but ...

193
00:13:51.383 --> 00:13:54.424
No need to do tonight but
I can arrange for tomorrow ...

194
00:13:54.425 --> 00:13:57.342
No. No. No. No. No.
So you came here, is not it?

195
00:13:57.383 --> 00:13:59.841
No, no, no, go.
I'll be fine.

196
00:13:59.842 --> 00:14:03.883
You sit through tonight
and nothing to read.

197
00:14:06.925 --> 00:14:10.342
Not like that.
No.

198
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:16.632
Although I had read a lot
interesting article

199
00:14:16.633 --> 00:14:18.758
something Brazilian.

200
00:14:18.842 --> 00:14:21.382
These pages have
stick all together.

201
00:14:24.841 --> 00:14:26.507
I've.

202
00:14:35.299 --> 00:14:37.049

203
00:14:38.382 --> 00:14:40.216
- What are you doing, man?
- Jim!

204
00:14:41.224 --> 00:14:42.166
Children.

205
00:14:42.216 --> 00:14:43.591
There he is!

206
00:14:44.049 --> 00:14:45.091
You did it!

207
00:14:45.299 --> 00:14:48.116
I lost your marriage, but there was
if I lose and reunification.

208
00:14:48.257 --> 00:14:49.756
What does D man?

209
00:14:49.757 --> 00:14:51.798
- Glad to see you.
- And I my friend.

210
00:14:53.048 --> 00:14:55.214
You look fine.
Look at how you are.

211
00:14:55.215 --> 00:14:57.173
Come stop now!

212
00:15:12.965 --> 00:15:16.089

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.005
- Hey, Jim.

215
00:15:20.006 --> 00:15:21.756
What does my friend?

216
00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:26.254
After the problems I had in
Beijing moved to Dubai.

217
00:15:26.255 --> 00:15:30.172
And then I turned
the world upside down.

218
00:15:30.255 --> 00:15:33.338
After 2009 I was living with
Aboriginal something.

219
00:15:33.339 --> 00:15:36.797
I did a
honorary sign.

220
00:15:37.964 --> 00:15:39.421
It seems to hurt it.

221
00:15:39.422 --> 00:15:41.504
It seems to hurt
it does hurt, KEB.

222
00:15:41.505 --> 00:15:45.296
Since I travel with
machine in South America.

223
00:15:45.297 --> 00:15:49.089
So, you're the most interesting
man in the world.

224
00:15:49.422 --> 00:15:53.295
Let me guess. Welcome

You got it!

00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:57.378
I've seen you somewhere?

227
00:15:57.379 --> 00:16:02.879
- Yes, I appear on television.
- No, not you, but you.

228
00:16:03.671 --> 00:16:07.754
The person you
are very familiar.

229
00:16:08.171 --> 00:16:11.004
Yes! You're the one, right?

230
00:16:14.879 --> 00:16:16.503
I swear that the
I had forgotten that.

231
00:16:16.504 --> 00:16:19.545
How many times played

232
00:16:19.546 --> 00:16:23.504
Leave him alone! I bet that
then you were all still virgins!

233
00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.127
- Selina Bacon.
- You're Selina Bacon?

234
00:16:31.128 --> 00:16:33.002
- It does not matter.
- The Selina has a shop that is ...

235
00:16:33.003 --> 00:16:34.586
Wait a minute.
Her friend Michelle the band?

236
00:16:34.587 --> 00:16:37.252
- You got it!
- Sorry, not in recognition.

237
00:16:37.253 --> 00:16:38.378
You look ...

238
00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.878

239
00:16:40.962 --> 00:16:43.587
The next round is on us

00:16:53.587 --> 00:16:54.960
And be sure
that you will not be in

00:16:54.961 --> 00:16:56.501

246
00:16:56.502 --> 00:16:57.919

of reunification and

247
00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.118
we want to drink,
without you being there.

248
00:17:00.119 --> 00:17:01.335
The "catch?

249
00:17:01.336 --> 00:17:04.126
First of all, Stephen,

250
00:17:04.127 --> 00:17:05.750
You're lucky to

You wanted to grab a job
and set I caught.

00:17:07.711 --> 00:17:09.711
Let me at least
home for the weekend.

253
00:17:09.712 --> 00:17:12.293
My house, theirs
my rules.

254

<i> As for tonight </ i>

255
00:17:13.627 --> 00:17:15.960

Mercy.

258
00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:31.126
Barmaid, bring

259
00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:40.601

260
00:17:47.393 --> 00:17:49.267

I sent e-mail, two
days before the reunion.

263
00:17:56.435 --> 00:18:00.516
You know, you might put
2 "f" in Stifmaister.

264
00:18:00.517 --> 00:18:02.225
- What?
- Sorry.

265
00:18:05.559 --> 00:18:08.650

- What are you doing?
- You know now ...

272
00:18:27.309 --> 00:18:29.725
Investment bullshit ...

273
00:18:30.058 --> 00:18:32.557
So our economic
system is completely dissolved.

274
00:18:32.558 --> 00:18:35.515
Nice scarf. See

275

276
00:18:37.141 --> 00:18:38.682
Stay away from the
My mother, my chicken shit.

277
00:18:38.683 --> 00:18:40.807
Okay children,

278
00:18:40.808 --> 00:18:43.641
You can drop

The Ugly Duckling
transformed into a swan.

00:19:00.766 --> 00:19:01.848
Let me see.

285
00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:08.865
Currently I put the finger, this

With shouting, "Large swarms."

290
00:19:25.307 --> 00:19:27.682
It was the mouth
I escaped.

291
00:19:28.098 --> 00:19:30.181
- Last orders.
- From Now?

292
00:19:30.182 --> 00:19:31.765
Wait here children.

00:19:35.581 --> 00:19:38.497
List of wishes?

FINTS: "I hope to find
the "my big Amore."

305
00:20:03.081 --> 00:20:06.705
Yes. True love.

306

But even to know what

00:20:11.413 --> 00:20:14.621
Yes, because to the fucks
Stifler's mother does not count.

00:20:25.663 --> 00:20:27.912
Your wife should

312
00:20:27.913 --> 00:20:31.245
- When I went out with Vicky then.
- Seriously?

313
00:20:31.246 --> 00:20:33.205
To see what I wrote.

"I hope to have sexual
Ricky Martin's life. "

316
00:20:47.287 --> 00:20:50.869
I guess you did not know
then, it's gay.

317
00:20:50.870 --> 00:20:54.786
Jim, it's good you found a
woman who had sex like 12 teams.

318
00:20:54.787 --> 00:20:57.245
Perhaps you have had sex
more and all of us together.

319
00:20:57.870 --> 00:21:01.869
- I guess ... I do not know ..
- I hope you are thirsty children.

320
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:04.078

- As old.
- Yes!

328

That's why I'm here.

329
00:21:21.578 --> 00:21:23.535
Without concepts, without
Our housewives.

330
00:21:23.536 --> 00:21:27.703
We have another opportunity.
It is the 13th reunion.

00:22:29.451 --> 00:22:34.742
- How much watered them last night?
- Seriously, not much.

341
00:22:35.034 --> 00:22:37.991
You must clean
all this before we go to the lake.

342
00:22:37.992 --> 00:22:39.201
What

00:22:40.034 --> 00:22:42.199
At the lake?

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.907
Yes, the lake, man.
Idea was yours.

345
00:22:44.908 --> 00:22:47.491
We discussed

347
00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:52.366
give paper napkins,
please?

348
00:22:55.658 --> 00:22:58.366
- These napkins?
- Yes, the paper.

349
00:23:01.366 --> 00:23:03.574
Paper napkins, Jim.

350
00:23:03.575 --> 00:23:06.700
Jim, how are you?

351
00:23:12.532 --> 00:23:14.407
Really sorry.

352
00:23:15.115 --> 00:23:20.407
Jim, you know that
lid is transparent, right?

353
00:23:30.699 --> 00:23:33.199
He is the father
my child!

354
00:23:47.406 --> 00:23:50.739
- Hey ... malakistiri
- What was that?

355
00:23:50.823 --> 00:23:52.739
All right.
Geez ...

356
00:23:53.114 --> 00:23:55.738
I am wrong, or was this part
more fun when you were young?

357
00:23:55.739 --> 00:23:57.406
No, I think it is
remain the same.

358
00:23:57.407 --> 00:23:59.739
Simply we grew up.

359
00:24:00.031 --> 00:24:02.739
We were so we
curious as kids now?

360
00:24:02.864 --> 00:24:07.155
No. We, the generation that,
we were more mature.

361
00:24:07.156 --> 00:24:08.864
Guys, look!

362
00:24:09.906 --> 00:24:12.156
MounoKarcharias!

363
00:24:16.738 --> 00:24:18.072
Take it back.

364
00:24:27.863 --> 00:24:31.029
My God, still staring at you?

365
00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:33.572
- Yes.
- Yes, staring.

366
00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.904
They could not
be more considerate?

367
00:24:38.905 --> 00:24:41.779
Let them enjoy a little.

368
00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:45.030
They do not see every day
a model on the beach.

369
00:24:45.904 --> 00:24:51.946
We long to rub
pepper to Levenstin house.

370
00:24:51.987 --> 00:24:56.904
- Why not?
- I do not know, I am a mother now.

371
00:24:57.154 --> 00:25:00.278
Please now,
because you're mother is not

372
00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:03.779
means that there must
and just have fun.

373
00:25:04.862 --> 00:25:10.403
Do you remember a time in camp
that we put cream on each other.

374
00:25:10.404 --> 00:25:12.737
Yes, yes, I remember!

375
00:25:13.612 --> 00:25:16.112
But just keep it in
memories that, okay?

376
00:25:18.528 --> 00:25:20.235
This solves ...

377
00:25:20.236 --> 00:25:22.194
We have to solve,
otherwise it leaves stripes.

378
00:25:22.195 --> 00:25:24.360
- They look the tits on the sides.
- Well.

379
00:25:24.361 --> 00:25:25.778
Come ...

380
00:25:27.903 --> 00:25:29.778
You're lucky, Oz.

381
00:25:30.445 --> 00:25:35.861
Okay kids, I think we all
We're just ... lucky.

382
00:25:39.778 --> 00:25:41.611
This is Heather?

383
00:25:45.195 --> 00:25:47.153
Yes, that is.

384
00:25:47.195 --> 00:25:48.360
Yes.

385
00:25:50.069 --> 00:25:52.735
- Heather.
- Chris.

386
00:25:53.877 --> 00:25:56.919
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?

387
00:25:57.877 --> 00:26:00.751
It seems to me that we had
the same idea, right?

388
00:26:00.752 --> 00:26:03.168
Chris, this is
Ron, my boy.

389
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:05.918
Chris Ostraiker, Ron Douglas,
I was glad to meet you.

390
00:26:05.919 --> 00:26:07.167
And I do the same.

391
00:26:07.168 --> 00:26:09.002
Ron is a cardiologist
My hospital.

392
00:26:09.085 --> 00:26:13.168
- A cardiologist?
- Listen, friends call me Dr. Ron,

393
00:26:13.169 --> 00:26:17.002
- Ron D'or-Andron. Call me as you like.
- Okay.

394
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.792
Come on D where are you?
Tetragonomagoulakia?

395
00:26:20.793 --> 00:26:23.951
And I am glad that
I see you, Stifler.

396
00:26:24.168 --> 00:26:27.126
- Who is the friend?
- I'm her boyfriend.

397
00:26:27.334 --> 00:26:33.084
You two jumped and
you both jumped.

398
00:26:34.501 --> 00:26:36.759
It should be very
strange to you all!

399
00:26:37.126 --> 00:26:38.501
Just got ...

400
00:26:39.459 --> 00:26:41.501
Someone stole my bra!

401
00:26:41.626 --> 00:26:43.125
Give me back!

402
00:26:43.126 --> 00:26:47.084
This is my girlfriend!

403
00:26:48.959 --> 00:26:51.084
And this and that.

404
00:26:53.125 --> 00:26:54.917
What do you think?

405
00:26:57.333 --> 00:27:00.167
Come on guys,
not nice.

406
00:27:00.208 --> 00:27:02.375
And what do
so re assholes?

407
00:27:11.542 --> 00:27:13.750
What was interesting though.

408
00:27:14.333 --> 00:27:16.916
- Should not you do something?
- No, like what to do?

409
00:27:16.917 --> 00:27:19.342
It should be
fall to their level.

410
00:27:19.343 --> 00:27:21.875
Screw it.

411
00:27:22.124 --> 00:27:27.874
- I know exactly where they go.
- Stifler?

412
00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:48.415
Where the hell is it?

413
00:27:48.416 --> 00:27:51.248
Guys, all this is nonsense.
I can not sit here any longer.

414
00:27:51.249 --> 00:27:53.290
- Why do not we go back?
- Come on.

415
00:27:53.291 --> 00:27:55.665
- Let the game do Stifler.
- Yes, so I'm afraid.

416
00:28:04.173 --> 00:28:07.731
You saw the eyebolts them?
Cancel.

417
00:28:10.123 --> 00:28:12.631
One of these types
was the nanny of the skull.

418
00:28:12.665 --> 00:28:14.289
Which of everyone?

419
00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.731
He seemed to
with Adam Sandler.

420
00:28:23.665 --> 00:28:25.746
I hope to Stifler
not do anything crazy.

421
00:28:25.747 --> 00:28:28.163
All you do is
them to chant one hand.

422
00:28:28.164 --> 00:28:29.703
Me said he would
chalage the jet ski them.

423
00:28:29.704 --> 00:28:31.663
Ma said he would
pee jug.

424
00:28:31.664 --> 00:28:34.164
Wait a minute, I told my
that they would steal the beer.

425
00:28:35.747 --> 00:28:37.455
A re Stifler ...

426
00:28:47.497 --> 00:28:50.205
Wait, he is.

427
00:28:51.247 --> 00:28:54.079
Yes, get the beers.

428
00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.164
Fast, Stifler.
Go.

429
00:28:57.038 --> 00:28:59.038
- What?
- What?

430
00:28:59.079 --> 00:29:01.996
No no no, my God!

431
00:29:05.121 --> 00:29:07.370
Still think that
Kara will sit you tonight?

432
00:29:07.371 --> 00:29:09.828
He said he expects to
become 18, you do the operations.

433
00:29:09.829 --> 00:29:15.238
But my friend, you put the dick
in your pussy, 0 times!

434
00:29:23.371 --> 00:29:25.704
My God, it's disgusting!

435
00:29:27.687 --> 00:29:29.178
What are you doing?

436
00:29:29.179 --> 00:29:30.002
<i> Kakakia! </ i>

437
00:29:30.037 --> 00:29:31.495
Quick, go!

438
00:29:32.995 --> 00:29:35.412
Jonathan!
Go do it!

439
00:29:38.078 --> 00:29:39.245
Go, go!

440
00:29:41.828 --> 00:29:44.537
- Do you want another beer?
- Of course.

441
00:29:45.828 --> 00:29:47.368
Guys, I tell you
that today will be

442
00:29:47.369 --> 00:29:49.245
The day that I have promised.

443
00:29:56.245 --> 00:29:57.412
What the hell?

444
00:29:58.645 --> 00:29:59.811
E panivlaka!

445
00:30:17.102 --> 00:30:19.644
Stifler, you're crazy?

446
00:30:19.686 --> 00:30:21.101
Geez Stifler.

447
00:30:21.102 --> 00:30:23.060
What happened to "simply
steal the beer? "

448
00:30:23.061 --> 00:30:24.976
I know, this is
far better.

449
00:30:24.977 --> 00:30:26.144
What

450
00:30:27.394 --> 00:30:29.519
But to destroy
of the jet ski?

451
00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:31.060
We splash.

452
00:30:31.935 --> 00:30:33.893
And so ...

453
00:30:38.935 --> 00:30:40.725
Come children now
because it was fun.

454
00:30:40.726 --> 00:30:43.600
Yes it can be had in high school
plate, is now a felony.

455
00:30:43.601 --> 00:30:45.225
Only if we get caught.

456
00:30:45.226 --> 00:30:47.434
I can say that the
deserved retaliation.

457
00:30:47.435 --> 00:30:49.684
We must learn to respect
their elders.

458
00:30:49.685 --> 00:30:50.893
Exactly!

459
00:30:51.185 --> 00:30:53.726
Give me a minute, I want to
I'm going to throw something rouketidia.

460
00:30:54.143 --> 00:30:55.310
Disgust.

461
00:30:55.935 --> 00:30:59.392
- What does the class of '99?
- My God!

462
00:30:59.393 --> 00:31:00.560
Vicky!

463
00:31:00.685 --> 00:31:02.058
- Hello!
- Hey!

464
00:31:02.059 --> 00:31:05.099
- I can not believe you did that!
- Yes, last night I came from New York.

465
00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.766
I live with my parents still there.
Talking about you earlier.

466
00:31:08.767 --> 00:31:10.599
Seriously?
Why

467
00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:13.641
For then we are caught doing
we did the waterfall.

468
00:31:13.642 --> 00:31:17.599
The waterfall, I have
I go too many years!

469
00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.891
Many romantic
stories to the waterfalls.

470
00:31:19.892 --> 00:31:21.558
Very romantic.

471
00:31:21.559 --> 00:31:24.724
Yes, I played the first
my shit to the waterfalls.

472
00:31:24.725 --> 00:31:25.725
Ok ...

473
00:31:27.725 --> 00:31:30.517
- Come on, baby!
- Honey ...

474
00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:36.182
Say with the children
go to the waterfall.

475
00:31:36.183 --> 00:31:38.765
And what about the time
the "Jim and Michelle"?

476
00:31:38.766 --> 00:31:41.598
I thought I would
was more romantic.

477
00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:45.723
I would like, but we leave
your father alone all day.

478
00:31:45.724 --> 00:31:49.640
Yes, you're right.
Well, we'll go another time.

479
00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:52.973
- No, go and have fun
- Seriously?

480
00:31:52.974 --> 00:31:57.807
But when you get back home
Being ready for anything.

481
00:31:57.808 --> 00:32:00.599
- You being ready for everything!
- I will!

482
00:32:07.282 --> 00:32:09.781
Stifler, you know that going?

483
00:32:09.782 --> 00:32:12.698
I know this place
like my dick.

484
00:32:23.448 --> 00:32:26.282
It looks like a party school.

485
00:32:27.907 --> 00:32:30.407
In high school chicks!

486
00:32:31.115 --> 00:32:33.781
- It is terrible!
- Watch your steps, your chief.

487
00:32:33.782 --> 00:32:34.865
Most girls
I have a half years.

488
00:32:34.866 --> 00:32:36.239
I know.

489
00:32:41.239 --> 00:32:43.446
Okay, my idea is
or indeed girls

490
00:32:43.447 --> 00:32:46.196
Nowadays,
more kariolakia?

491
00:32:46.197 --> 00:32:48.114
Sure is. Sex
puberty, parties

492
00:32:48.115 --> 00:32:50.406
with tripakia, naked photos

493
00:32:50.656 --> 00:32:52.531
no longer exist
Catholic girls.

494
00:32:53.031 --> 00:32:55.489
Happy Birthday!

495
00:33:02.281 --> 00:33:04.613
- Jim?
- Kara.

496
00:33:04.614 --> 00:33:06.614
- Finally came!
- Yes.

497
00:33:08.113 --> 00:33:09.238
I'm sorry.

498
00:33:11.113 --> 00:33:12.613
Happy Birthday.

499
00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.321
My God, this
are you the nanny?

500
00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:19.070
Sounds like
I am a super hero.

501
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:22.321
<i> faster than sphere and
stronger than the kwstasna. </ i>

502
00:33:23.738 --> 00:33:25.946
- I said that is funny.
- And adorable!

503
00:33:28.196 --> 00:33:29.321
Jim, would not
recommend to your friends?

504
00:33:29.322 --> 00:33:30.155
No.

505
00:33:33.821 --> 00:33:36.112
Girls, here is Stifler.

506
00:33:36.113 --> 00:33:38.278
Since you know the
My buddy Jim?

507
00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:40.904
Jim was my nanny.

508
00:33:41.445 --> 00:33:42.987
Once I'd go for
birthday shots.

509
00:33:42.988 --> 00:33:44.903
Want to come?

510
00:33:44.904 --> 00:33:47.987
- No, no, no.
- Yes, yes, yes.

511
00:33:49.695 --> 00:33:53.945
I never
had sex in public.

512
00:33:58.445 --> 00:33:59.320
Seriously?

513
00:33:59.487 --> 00:34:00.778
None of you?

514
00:34:00.779 --> 00:34:03.820
Come if you do not
You do not even once

515
00:34:03.945 --> 00:34:05.819
you are so Puritan.

516
00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.987
Or simply do not have
sex in public.

517
00:34:09.819 --> 00:34:15.194
Okay, I have
never participated in the orgy.

518
00:34:20.653 --> 00:34:23.444
It was very nice guys.

519
00:34:24.444 --> 00:34:26.985
Believe it or not, this
is the first party to go.

520
00:34:26.986 --> 00:34:29.152
You have not lost too much.

521
00:34:29.153 --> 00:34:33.486
We always prefer to sit
home and listening to radio.

522
00:34:33.903 --> 00:34:35.527
You were much more cool
from me though.

523
00:34:35.528 --> 00:34:39.444
I sat and wrote stories
for X-Files.

524
00:34:41.277 --> 00:34:45.652
I translated the "Brothers
Karamazov "in Latin ...

525
00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:47.235
... For fun.

526
00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:51.152
It's very sexy.

527
00:34:51.735 --> 00:34:53.776
I know it is.

528
00:34:53.777 --> 00:34:56.526
I work all these
years as an architect

529
00:34:56.527 --> 00:34:57.652
from home.

530
00:34:57.943 --> 00:35:00.193
You're in the same company here
and 10 years is fuck.

531
00:35:00.318 --> 00:35:01.984
All to hear your doing well.

532
00:35:01.985 --> 00:35:04.192
Yes, everything is going well.

533
00:35:04.193 --> 00:35:05.817
Especially in business.

534
00:35:05.818 --> 00:35:09.151
But when you come to your city
and see all your friends

535
00:35:09.152 --> 00:35:11.359
being married with children

536
00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:13.025
just makes me ...

537
00:35:13.026 --> 00:35:14.651
... To think.

538
00:35:16.901 --> 00:35:18.984
Are you okay, kid?

539
00:35:19.317 --> 00:35:21.858
Yes, so do not drink anymore.

540
00:35:21.859 --> 00:35:23.482
You tell me that you have
do not just head

541
00:35:23.483 --> 00:35:25.650
Myers in the home,
no wine night?

542
00:35:25.651 --> 00:35:28.858
I see a monitor
my profile in Facebook.

543
00:35:28.859 --> 00:35:31.191
At least I do not I make
photos on my knees.

544
00:35:31.192 --> 00:35:33.316
Who monitors what now?

545
00:35:33.317 --> 00:35:35.441
Okay, maybe I entered
your profile once or twice.

546
00:35:35.442 --> 00:35:40.026
Going out with someone
who say, Alejandro?

547
00:35:40.026 --> 00:35:41.482
He knows he can put and

548
00:35:41.483 --> 00:35:43.191
no photos
shirt over it?

549
00:35:43.192 --> 00:35:47.316
The Alejandro has
finished long ago.

550
00:35:49.233 --> 00:35:50.441
Too bad huh?

551
00:35:54.816 --> 00:35:56.982
Okay, after this
drink will go home.

552
00:35:56.983 --> 00:36:01.775
Jim, here is a 18 year old
kaflaki that the nannies.

553
00:36:01.775 --> 00:36:03.857
And you do not
anything about it?

554
00:36:03.858 --> 00:36:06.315
Let me remind you that I am
married to Michelle?

555
00:36:06.316 --> 00:36:08.400
Exactly.

556
00:36:08.608 --> 00:36:13.358
Dude, do these kaflakia
crazy things in bed.

557
00:36:13.983 --> 00:36:16.106
That learn from Kara ...

558
00:36:16.107 --> 00:36:19.482
Go home ...
and do it with Michelle.

559
00:36:19.982 --> 00:36:22.398
Cares about
your marriage, so Jim?

560
00:36:22.399 --> 00:36:26.190
What are you talking Stifler?
Fraud will not be my wife.

561
00:36:26.274 --> 00:36:28.399
I am a father,
for God's sake.

562
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:30.731
Yes, it is perfect.

563
00:36:30.732 --> 00:36:31.980
The worship gkomenakia
their fathers.

564
00:36:31.981 --> 00:36:33.649
He continued to
Throw the tale.

565
00:36:33.815 --> 00:36:35.565
Is not a fairytale,
is the truth!

566
00:36:37.065 --> 00:36:40.189
- How about here?
- You know now ...

567
00:36:40.190 --> 00:36:44.190
Jim told us how
that was fun to watch.

568
00:36:44.982 --> 00:36:47.398
Why not go
to drink a little?

569
00:36:47.648 --> 00:36:50.773
No need, we could
to do together.

570
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:54.439
- Yes, that is Stifler.
- To become a dad.

571
00:36:55.439 --> 00:36:57.023
Stifler!

572
00:37:00.098 --> 00:37:05.014
Well, apparently me and
You have an exciting life.

573
00:37:05.139 --> 00:37:07.680
Sometimes a little too bold.

574
00:37:07.681 --> 00:37:12.180
Yes, I am inclined to more
conservative side.

575
00:37:12.181 --> 00:37:14.223
- But ...
- Hello.

576
00:37:15.973 --> 00:37:19.847
Let me be frank, Chris.
I have been a little bolder.

577
00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:24.096
Where to go Ron?

578
00:37:24.097 --> 00:37:27.930
I'm not from these
that make "changes".

579
00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:33.513
But if you go back to
Heather, makes it more normal.

580
00:37:34.055 --> 00:37:36.638
Well, what do you think?

581
00:37:37.722 --> 00:37:39.597
As if to agree?

582
00:37:40.763 --> 00:37:43.055
Come do your plate.
Just kidding!

583
00:37:43.972 --> 00:37:46.513
Seriously, would not
never did that.

584
00:37:46.888 --> 00:37:49.013
Unless you like it.

585
00:37:49.929 --> 00:37:52.845
They really have gone all
the countries of South America?

586
00:37:52.846 --> 00:37:54.678
No, not at all.

587
00:37:54.679 --> 00:37:57.429
And do not include
countries of French Guiana.

588
00:38:00.054 --> 00:38:02.720
I remember how I expected
and that the graduation

589
00:38:02.721 --> 00:38:05.846
to leave this country
and find myself.

590
00:38:06.304 --> 00:38:07.554
Certainly
you found yourself.

591
00:38:07.555 --> 00:38:08.887
I do not know ...

592
00:38:09.887 --> 00:38:14.845
There is a place inside me that still
wishes to explore the world.

593
00:38:14.846 --> 00:38:19.346
- To become that I wanted to be.
- You can become anything you want.

594
00:38:20.486 --> 00:38:22.694
You just have to become.

595
00:38:22.695 --> 00:38:25.861
- Want to fasothoume?
- Yes!

596
00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.610
Are you crazy? Love
the books "Twilight".

597
00:38:31.611 --> 00:38:34.611
The "New Moon" is
my favorite.

598
00:38:35.195 --> 00:38:39.235
- And me the same!
- My God, look how much we have in common!

599
00:38:39.236 --> 00:38:41.486
- I know!
- I know!

600
00:38:42.695 --> 00:38:46.195
- You want a "fine"?
- And when two lotteries.

601
00:38:54.235 --> 00:38:57.277
I do not know who they are, but drowning
to work this time.

602
00:38:57.860 --> 00:38:59.734
Sorry for the
interruption, Stafler.

603
00:38:59.735 --> 00:39:01.859
I did not know how the Paralympics
Games were held today.

604
00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.943
- Damn.
- What the hell are you doing?

605
00:39:05.944 --> 00:39:07.943
Smothered with
on your own dick?

606
00:39:07.944 --> 00:39:11.152
Nothing runs.

607
00:39:11.527 --> 00:39:13.276
What can I do
for you, sir?

608
00:39:13.277 --> 00:39:14.901
The assistant to Bob,
had a heart attack.

609
00:39:14.902 --> 00:39:18.151
Someone told him that stupid
flipare discharged and do not know.

610
00:39:18.152 --> 00:39:20.568
I want someone to finish
the presentation.

611
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:23.484
I want to go Sunday and
to prepare everything, okay?

612
00:39:23.526 --> 00:39:27.775
Wait a minute, Sunday I

President and we will arrange another day.

614
00:39:32.526 --> 00:39:36.692

615
00:39:36.693 --> 00:39:38.567
Geez, what
I do know something?

616
00:39:38.568 --> 00:39:42.276

- No, no, no. Listen.

00:39:47.068 --> 00:39:48.401
Please do not

619
00:39:48.402 --> 00:39:50.234
Stifler to say.

620
00:39:50.901 --> 00:39:51.943
Asshole!

621
00:39:52.109 --> 00:39:55.316
- Ladies ...
- They left my friend.

622
00:39:55.317 --> 00:39:57.067
Damn!

623
00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:05.900
Kara, how would you go home tonight?

624
00:40:06.483 --> 00:40:10.482
The AJ was supposed to go,
but has not yet appeared.

625
00:40:10.483 --> 00:40:12.899
He found a dumb excuse
on the jet ski.

626
00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.067
In think the asshole?

627
00:40:16.733 --> 00:40:19.733
And what would you do?
Can you go?

628
00:40:22.317 --> 00:40:25.525
Come, at the same place we go.

629
00:40:25.649 --> 00:40:27.355
And it is you
responsible if a

630
00:40:27.356 --> 00:40:29.524
Let It Ride
in such a situation.

631
00:40:30.357 --> 00:40:31.566
So?

632
00:40:41.524 --> 00:40:43.982
Kara, sit down please.

633
00:40:44.191 --> 00:40:45.566
My God, I love it
this song.

634
00:40:45.567 --> 00:40:46.941
It's good.

635
00:40:47.191 --> 00:40:49.190
The classic rock
is the best.

636
00:40:49.191 --> 00:40:52.107
Classic rock?
This is classic rock?

637
00:40:53.774 --> 00:40:55.607
Kara will be
drink more water.

638
00:40:55.608 --> 00:40:57.939
Where is the bottle
I gave you?

639
00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.648
- It's back here.
- Well.

640
00:41:08.065 --> 00:41:10.273
Sorry, sorry, it was a ...

641
00:41:11.148 --> 00:41:15.605
It was a squirrels

642
00:41:15.606 --> 00:41:19.398
This is not water ...

643
00:41:21.065 --> 00:41:23.522
Mild little more.

644
00:41:23.523 --> 00:41:27.565
I loved everything
the upcoming years.

645
00:41:28.355 --> 00:41:30.897
The job of nanny
never ends.

646
00:41:31.022 --> 00:41:33.730
You know that
always liked it, right?

647
00:41:35.355 --> 00:41:36.564
No. ...

648
00:41:38.189 --> 00:41:40.564
I want to be my first.

649
00:41:41.689 --> 00:41:43.564
Your first ...

650
00:41:43.855 --> 00:41:45.772
Oh, God!
Ok ...

651
00:41:45.897 --> 00:41:47.730
Kara, listen ...

652
00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:53.105
The virginity of a person
is something sacred, right?

653
00:41:53.647 --> 00:41:55.729
You should keep it
for someone special.

654
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:57.813
- You are special.
- No!

655
00:41:57.814 --> 00:42:01.813
I'm not special ...
Do you think?

656
00:42:02.479 --> 00:42:04.688
What are you doing?

657
00:42:04.896 --> 00:42:06.146
Well, what do you do?

658
00:42:06.271 --> 00:42:08.938
Come on, nobody
I would not know.

659
00:42:09.813 --> 00:42:12.228
No, no ...
No, I think ...

660
00:42:12.229 --> 00:42:13.563
I do not find beautiful?

661
00:42:15.354 --> 00:42:16.895
You are very beautiful Kara ...

662
00:42:16.896 --> 00:42:20.438
- Seriously?
- Yes, very beautiful.

663
00:42:22.188 --> 00:42:26.271
Oh, God!
Notre me!

664
00:42:26.438 --> 00:42:28.021
What ...

665
00:42:28.313 --> 00:42:30.520
Where did you get that?

666
00:42:30.521 --> 00:42:32.602
Come on, I can not think

668
00:42:32.603 ??-> 00:42:34.978
How about a new iPhone;

667

668
00:42:37.603 --> 00:42:39.353
I want!

669
00:42:40.187 --> 00:42:42.561
Do not do that!
It is not right ...

670
00:42:42.562 --> 00:42:44.520
Come stop, Kara!

671
00:42:46.687 --> 00:42:48.562
Shit!

672
00:42:52.437 --> 00:42:53.645
Kara?

673
00:43:10.744 --> 00:43:12.535
Geez!
Kara!

674
00:43:12.536 --> 00:43:15.202
Wake Kara, please, wake up!

675
00:43:21.244 --> 00:43:22.494
Hello!

676
00:43:23.619 --> 00:43:27.994
Jim? What ...
Unbelievable!

677
00:43:29.036 --> 00:43:32.952
- Are you okay?
- Yes. I'm fine, just ...

678
00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:38.826
I bent over to grab something
but everything is okay.

679
00:43:39.826 --> 00:43:41.700
- Everything is okay.
- I do not know if you heard ...

680
00:43:41.701 --> 00:43:42.868
Do not you learned?

681
00:43:43.201 --> 00:43:45.950
I am responsible
for reunification.

682
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:47.035
Yeah, right!

683
00:43:48.035 --> 00:43:50.201
I've organized all
with the style of the 90s.

684
00:43:51.701 --> 00:43:54.284
I close the Bouktsampouampa.

685
00:43:54.285 --> 00:43:56.617
But assholes

686
00:43:56.618 --> 00:43:58.784
But you know me now ...

687
00:43:58.785 --> 00:44:01.451
You throw me down,
but I get up immediately.

688
00:44:04.784 --> 00:44:07.950
My God, now
I realized what was happening.

689
00:44:14.742 --> 00:44:18.159
- See you later, buddy.
- Okay, see you.

690
00:44:20.575 --> 00:44:22.616
Geez!
Kara?

691
00:44:22.617 --> 00:44:23.784
Kara, wake up!

692
00:44:24.534 --> 00:44:27.116
- You will fall for a while ...
- What? Kara is not the time to sleep.

693
00:44:27.117 --> 00:44:28.991
Kara, wake up, not hours
to sleep!

694
00:44:28.992 --> 00:44:30.492
Kara!

695
00:44:36.658 --> 00:44:40.616
Bad it!
Too bad that!

696
00:44:51.824 --> 00:44:53.365
What took you so long?

697
00:44:53.366 --> 00:44:55.198
We were looking for Kevin,
but we found him.

698
00:44:55.199 --> 00:44:57.782
Plus that chick
of the Oz drank too

699
00:44:57.783 --> 00:44:59.198
and had to go to
leave the house.

700
00:44:59.199 --> 00:45:01.115
- Bring and him?
- Of course they brought me.

701
00:45:01.116 --> 00:45:02.989
While you were playing the
in high school, I

702
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.865
travaga such gully
every weekend.

703
00:45:04.866 --> 00:45:06.699
Let's see, what
we can do.

704
00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:12.365
Christoula me!

705
00:45:13.157 --> 00:45:16.114
- Well done, Jim!
- There was nothing, Stifler.

706
00:45:16.115 --> 00:45:17.822
Okay?
Nothing happened.

707
00:45:17.823 --> 00:45:19.865
- Your hand away.
- Sorry.

708
00:45:20.073 --> 00:45:21.155
Well, Jim, what
think you do?

709
00:45:21.156 --> 00:45:22.115
I do not know.

710
00:45:22.532 --> 00:45:24.447
I can not
so I leave here naked.

711
00:45:24.448 --> 00:45:27.031
If the cops find and
learn that I am involved ...

712
00:45:27.032 --> 00:45:30.865
- ... The fuck.
- Leaves us two options then.

713
00:45:32.157 --> 00:45:34.197
Give up the corpse, or
put through the hole.

714
00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:36.406
To give up the corpse?
We are not in the Mafia.

715
00:45:36.407 --> 00:45:38.863
Half leptaki, I
go home,

716
00:45:38.864 --> 00:45:41.280
million times
to the next.

717
00:45:41.281 --> 00:45:44.196
Sure I can put
hole through the back door.

718
00:45:44.197 --> 00:45:48.196
As you distract the
her parents, what say you about it?

719
00:45:48.197 --> 00:45:53.197
I am an expert in that Jim!
Trust me, I have.

720
00:46:00.981 --> 00:46:04.771
Good evening, sir.
The car broke down friend.

721
00:46:04.772 --> 00:46:06.479
And wondering

00:46:31.771 --> 00:46:34.520
- You did very well, Stifler.
- Shut up asshole hours.

729
00:46:34.521 --> 00:46:37.021
The last time the
I did not have cell phones.

730
00:46:51.729 --> 00:46:53.187
Shit!

731
00:46:59.395 --> 00:47:01.187

732
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:03.937
Look, Mom, Dad!

733
00:47:20.811 --> 00:47:22.894
Kara?

734
00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:25.269
Kara?

735
00:47:27.394 --> 00:47:30.685
- Kara?
- You must find me!

736
00:47:30.686 --> 00:47:32.186
Kara?

737
00:47:33.353 --> 00:47:35.393
Thank Siranta!

00:47:37.853 --> 00:47:40.394
And you be careful!

00:47:42.019 --> 00:47:46.477
On the Road spoke Help

741
00:47:47.435 --> 00:47:49.727
Reminds you of something
this song?

742
00:47:54.352 --> 00:47:55.683
You're such a good dancer
Worries that

743
00:47:55.684 --> 00:47:57.142

00:47:57.143 --> 00:47:58.352
Thank you.

745
00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.643
Where you are more sexy in person.

746
00:48:02.518 --> 00:48:05.851
- To relax a bit, sweetie.
- What? Just say ...

747
00:48:05.852 --> 00:48:08.267
Malacca, he wants to fuck!

748
00:48:08.268 --> 00:48:11.851
- She does not sit on anything!
- Do not be selfish.

749
00:48:11.852 --> 00:48:14.893
I think we should
go to the bathroom.

750
00:48:16.101 --> 00:48:17.976
Kara!
It is not funny!

751
00:48:18.101 --> 00:48:19.642
Kara!
Come on.

752
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:21.767
Get out, Kara!

753
00:48:33.651 --> 00:48:36.650
Jim, do not want to worry,
but you do not have much time.

754
00:48:36.651 --> 00:48:39.192
- Yes, I know ...
- I like your scarf!

755
00:48:41.151 --> 00:48:42.276
Would you mind
get a picture?

756
00:48:42.277 --> 00:48:43.567
And, of course.

757
00:48:48.233 --> 00:48:50.525
Somewhere here it is!

758
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:59.233
- Are you well?
- Yes, yes.

759
00:48:59.483 --> 00:49:05.774
You know something, I admired how
clean is your bathroom.

760
00:49:05.775 --> 00:49:06.941
Thank you.

761
00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.858
You know what? I and
I go to the toilet.

762
00:49:08.859 --> 00:49:10.858
No, it is not necessary.

763
00:49:18.774 --> 00:49:21.106
- Come to put to bed.
- You lie down with me?

764
00:49:21.107 --> 00:49:23.565
- No, I will not lie to you.
- Come to bed with me!

765
00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.273
- Stifler, what are you doing here?
- I wanted to take a look.

766
00:49:30.274 --> 00:49:32.440
- No!
- I want to see more hours.

767
00:49:35.857 --> 00:49:39.273
- What was that?
- Heard from the outside.

768
00:49:39.274 --> 00:49:41.440
No, it was the
Kara's room.

769
00:49:42.399 --> 00:49:43.690
<i> Kara ... </ i>

770
00:49:56.731 --> 00:49:59.106
What the hell is going on here?

771
00:49:59.981 --> 00:50:01.856
Hey, Dad!

772
00:50:02.106 --> 00:50:04.231
How did you get?

773
00:50:04.273 --> 00:50:06.648
- I do not remember.
- Do not remember?

774
00:50:07.689 --> 00:50:10.022
- What was it that sounded?
- I do not know.

775
00:50:10.023 --> 00:50:12.314
- What do you mean you do not know?
- I do not know.

776
00:50:14.148 --> 00:50:16.647
- The drinking, right?
- No.

777
00:50:16.648 --> 00:50:18.980
Kara, I have said before
that these boys want

778
00:50:18.981 --> 00:50:21.396
in order to get drunk
to take advantage.

779
00:50:21.397 --> 00:50:23.479
I'm big enough to
understand this, Dad.

780
00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.313
I do not want to go to jail
because they broke the

781
00:50:25.314 --> 00:50:27.646
a wood malakismeno
which in kavlantize.

782
00:50:27.647 --> 00:50:30.063
But I will, believe me.

783
00:50:32.272 --> 00:50:33.772
What is this?

784
00:50:34.438 --> 00:50:36.772

- Happy birthday my princess.
- Thanks, Dad.

788
00:51:19.062 --> 00:51:20.479
What are you doing?

789
00:51:20.646 --> 00:51:22.062
Nothing.

790
00:51:29.145 --> 00:51:30.311
Stifler!

791
00:51:30.895 --> 00:51:32.270

Shit!

794
00:51:39.311 --> 00:51:41.520
What the hell was it again?

795
00:51:43.436 --> 00:51:47.227
Hey, you want to go to

796
00:51:47.228 --> 00:51:49.852

- Come, Stifler!

797
00:51:49.853 --> 00:51:51.145
Go.

798
00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:55.352
You two, stay here.

799
00:51:56.102 --> 00:51:57.977
Do not push me.

800
00:52:04.435 --> 00:52:07.019
Kara, who the hell are you?
I come to your house ...

801
00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:12.394
What the hell ...

802
00:52:17.977 --> 00:52:20.144
What the hell is going on here?

Hello! I thought
will not you come ...

804

Shit!

805
00:53:03.267 --> 00:53:05.516
- Supposed to ...
- Okay, never mind.

806
00:53:05.517 --> 00:53:08.017
What? No, my God,
not okay.

807
00:53:08.092 --> 00:53:10.757
A thousand apologies, Michelle.

808
00:53:10.758 --> 00:53:12.466
I wanted to just ...

809
00:53:12.467 --> 00:53:16.507
I'm going to let Evan in grandmother
I will have turned up in the afternoon.

810
00:53:16.508 --> 00:53:18.883
No! Wait a minute, Michelle.

811
00:53:22.383 --> 00:53:23.592
Jim, I worry.

812
00:53:23.925 --> 00:53:30.674
- Why worry?
- We are very, asynchronously.

813
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:37.216
How will we
To continue like this?

814
00:53:39.174 --> 00:53:45.132
I promise that I will do that
I can to make it up, okay?

815
00:53:45.174 --> 00:53:47.632
The Stifler make a party tonight ...

816
00:53:47.966 --> 00:53:53.298
Well, I know that
not romantic, but ...

817
00:53:53.299 --> 00:53:57.466
Remember our first time
was a party of Stifler.

818
00:53:58.299 --> 00:54:00.298
You made me your bitch.

819
00:54:02.381 --> 00:54:05.256
Yes, of course and I did.

820
00:54:24.256 --> 00:54:28.673
- Tell me if it's good.
- What the dick?

821
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:56.380
So ...

822
00:54:56.755 --> 00:55:01.671
One has a very
free spirit.

823
00:55:01.672 --> 00:55:04.963
- It's something else ...
- Yes it is!

824
00:55:06.838 --> 00:55:09.463
Wait a minute, maybe
I detect a jealousy?

825
00:55:09.463 --> 00:55:11.213
- No.
- No!

826
00:55:11.379 --> 00:55:15.378
Do you remember how to
broke before entering medicine.

827
00:55:15.379 --> 00:55:19.004
I moved to Los
Angeles, no return.

828
00:55:19.379 --> 00:55:22.337
You can not accuse me
I wanted to find something more permanent.

829
00:55:22.338 --> 00:55:28.628
No, not to blame. Just do not
I want to settle down somewhere.

830
00:55:28.629 --> 00:55:31.003
Who is jealous now?

831
00:55:31.004 --> 00:55:34.044
I would not say "permanent" is
I do now with Ron.

832
00:55:34.045 --> 00:55:38.002
- No, the cards are very good.
- What does that mean?

833
00:55:38.003 --> 00:55:42.670
Nothing.
I'm sorry.

834
00:55:43.545 --> 00:55:48.045
You're right.
I am a little jealous.

835
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:52.044
You know, it's funny.

836
00:55:52.045 --> 00:55:54.753
On some issues
has changed completely.

837
00:55:55.837 --> 00:55:58.961
And still others are self-same.

838
00:55:58.962 --> 00:56:02.753
Heather, I do not know whether to
believe. But nothing changed.

839
00:56:04.878 --> 00:56:07.418
Oh, my God!
Chris Ostraiker?

840
00:56:07.419 --> 00:56:08.709
Hello, girls.

841
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:10.543
We can draw
a picture?

842
00:56:10.544 --> 00:56:12.127
Yes, definitely.

843
00:56:17.294 --> 00:56:18.502
Dad?

844
00:56:20.336 --> 00:56:22.001
- Hey Dad.
- Hey Jim.

845
00:56:22.002 --> 00:56:23.543
I said to go out for a while.

846
00:56:23.544 --> 00:56:26.002
Now I saw the old
Your videotapes.

847
00:56:28.252 --> 00:56:31.627
<i> - I got the towel, sucker.
- Give it back, Stifler </ i>

848
00:56:33.294 --> 00:56:38.460
<i> I am the happiest
man on the planet today. </ i>

849
00:56:45.768 --> 00:56:48.017
Yes me and my
Dad is missing too.

850
00:56:48.018 --> 00:56:51.018
I know.

851
00:56:58.976 --> 00:57:03.350
Dad, you were always there
to give me advice.

852
00:57:03.351 --> 00:57:07.641
But if there is something you
like to talk ...

853
00:57:07.642 --> 00:57:09.809
I'm here ... for you.

854
00:57:12.184 --> 00:57:15.766
I do not think there
something that I want to talk.

855
00:57:15.767 --> 00:57:17.225
So ...

856
00:57:17.350 --> 00:57:20.308
Say ... it's time to ...

857
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:22.517
To know ... another one?

858
00:57:23.142 --> 00:57:25.683
Dad, do not run anything.

859
00:57:25.684 --> 00:57:30.142
What we spend
is perfectly normal.

860
00:57:30.434 --> 00:57:32.309
You know, there
various services ...

861
00:57:32.310 --> 00:57:34.059
Services?

862
00:57:34.579 --> 00:57:36.271
- Yes.
- Like what?

863
00:57:36.272 --> 00:57:38.262
- The happy ending?
- What?

864
00:57:38.263 --> 00:57:40.462
- Why not go there.
- God.

865
00:57:40.463 --> 00:57:43.046
I do not want this kind of massage.

866
00:57:43.047 --> 00:57:44.400
- No, I would say that.
- Jim.

867
00:57:44.401 --> 00:57:45.120
How you came to this?

868
00:57:45.121 --> 00:57:46.137
I do not know that
is dangerous.

869
00:57:46.138 --> 00:57:47.661
- Yes ...
- You can solder things.

870
00:57:47.662 --> 00:57:49.440
- Well, no ...
- Not even want to know.

871
00:57:49.441 --> 00:57:50.412
Those that can
and solder.

872
00:57:50.413 --> 00:57:51.386
Ask Uncle Morgan

873
00:57:51.387 --> 00:57:52.277
Yes I know, it's disgusting.

874
00:57:52.278 --> 00:57:54.810
.. Where was the
hospital for 2 weeks.

875
00:57:56.936 --> 00:58:02.312
I wanted to say that there are
Internet dating services.

876
00:58:02.313 --> 00:58:07.744
No, Jim. At my age?
I think not.

877
00:58:07.745 --> 00:58:09.637
I stopped
game long.

878
00:58:09.638 --> 00:58:11.457
But then we thought
even game.

879
00:58:11.458 --> 00:58:16.926
Dad, do not worry;
I will help.

880
00:58:21.367 --> 00:58:24.069
- You brought the pictures?
- Here.

881
00:58:24.628 --> 00:58:26.110
Yes ...

882
00:58:27.296 --> 00:58:28.312
We need to find
something more recent.

883
00:58:28.313 --> 00:58:29.497
Do you think?

884
00:58:31.107 --> 00:58:33.434
Have something that is more ...
sexy?

885
00:58:33.435 --> 00:58:35.722
I got.

886
00:58:41.924 --> 00:58:43.447
Favorite music?

887
00:58:43.448 --> 00:58:45.600
Katsamba Brothers.

888
00:58:45.693 --> 00:58:47.005
All right.

889
00:58:47.344 --> 00:58:51.232
- Opa.
- Girls, one by one please.

890
00:58:51.282 --> 00:58:53.949
- Interests and hobbies.
- Sudoku.

891
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:55.848
We will return to just that.

892
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:07.641
Definitely not remove too many?
My eyebrows are my charm.

893
00:59:09.555 --> 00:59:12.427
Ok ...
Perfect!

894
00:59:12.646 --> 00:59:15.093
- Take a look.
- I get stressed!

895
00:59:18.913 --> 00:59:25.552
It's fantastic!
And fuck the Luke for me!

896
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:31.565
Not fuse the two eyebrows.
There is mobility!

897
00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:33.098
Why did not
this 30 years ago?

898
00:59:33.099 --> 00:59:34.748
You look fine.

899
00:59:34.749 --> 00:59:37.578
Let me try it
my new style tonight.

900
00:59:37.882 --> 00:59:42.159
The problem is that we're going
Stifler in the party tonight.

901
00:59:42.160 --> 00:59:44.233
Okay then, another time.

902
00:59:44.234 --> 00:59:46.899
But you could
to join us.

903
00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.213
I would like very
to leave the house.

904
00:59:48.214 --> 00:59:50.034
I want to warn you though.

905
00:59:50.035 --> 00:59:54.557
The party of Stifler
can escape a little.

906
01:00:07.480 --> 01:00:13.655
What the hell is this?
Who changed the music?

907
01:00:13.663 --> 01:00:16.243
Sorry, we said it would be more
friendly to babies, is not it?

908
01:00:16.244 --> 01:00:17.846
Yes, that is!

909
01:00:18.827 --> 01:00:21.834
Meister tart!

910
01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:24.671
Oh no!
No!

911
01:00:30.811 --> 01:00:35.080
- What hours do nonsense?
- I just got engaged.

912
01:00:35.766 --> 01:00:38.171
- Yes.
- What? Sounds very gay.

913
01:00:38.283 --> 01:00:41.282
Yes, Stifler.
We are gay.

914
01:00:41.459 --> 01:00:44.923
Half the group was gay Lacrosse,
I had to know that, right?

915
01:00:45.313 --> 01:00:49.114
My friend got it to Doug and
Berry jumped to the shower.

916
01:00:49.250 --> 01:00:51.571
I thought I was struggling.

917
01:01:02.214 --> 01:01:04.711
Surely this place
Stifler is the?

918
01:01:04.712 --> 01:01:06.999
Appetizers.

919
01:01:07.677 --> 01:01:09.870
Go to the same
our host, my son!

920
01:01:13.012 --> 01:01:14.917
My God! Look who came!

921
01:01:14.918 --> 01:01:16.942
- Look who came to us!
- Hello.

922
01:01:18.601 --> 01:01:19.402
Hello you.

923
01:01:19.403 --> 01:01:20.589
Sorry you
interrupted the other day children.

924
01:01:20.590 --> 01:01:22.488
Well done on occasion.

925
01:01:22.666 --> 01:01:25.078
Most do not
after such a marriage.

926
01:01:25.079 --> 01:01:27.419
- What are you talking about?
- Changed hair color?

927
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:30.045
Your friend?

928
01:01:30.383 --> 01:01:32.161
The other is milfaras.

929
01:01:32.162 --> 01:01:35.372
It is here tonight I thought everything
erchosastan together in something like that.

930
01:01:35.592 --> 01:01:40.072
Let's say that friendship is not
are essentially.

931
01:01:41.181 --> 01:01:42.494
Excuse me.

932
01:01:46.162 --> 01:01:48.738
It may be more
this boring party?

933
01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:50.854
It is not so bad.

934
01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:55.306
- Want a couple Boublia?
- No! Why do you have that?

935
01:01:55.307 --> 01:01:58.373
After not eating no
here, what to do!

936
01:01:58.374 --> 01:02:00.441
Definitely do not want any?

937
01:02:00.533 --> 01:02:04.047
Yes, but ...
No! Yes! No!

938
01:02:04.048 --> 01:02:06.877
Okay, then.
More about me then.

939
01:02:11.416 --> 01:02:14.288
- We came we.
- There he is, Finch.

940
01:02:16.032 --> 01:02:19.037
Look around you. The
Believe it done?

941
01:02:19.038 --> 01:02:21.020
Yes, great!
Well you did!

942
01:02:21.028 --> 01:02:22.551
This is for you.

943
01:02:22.552 --> 01:02:24.498
What the hell are you
I have to do with it?

944
01:02:24.499 --> 01:02:26.954
- Wine is said, Stifler.
- No, no, no, no!

945
01:02:26.955 --> 01:02:29.191
Not in my party,
I'm going to get shots.

946
01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:32.771
- Hi, Kevin.
- I can speak for a while?

947
01:02:32.772 --> 01:02:35.305
Yes, definitely.
Wait here, I return.

948
01:02:37.261 --> 01:02:38.066
So ...

949
01:02:38.193 --> 01:02:40.436
- Brought them?
- Here it is!

950
01:02:40.437 --> 01:02:41.665
Let's see them.

951
01:02:44.460 --> 01:02:47.459
Where did the harlot?

952
01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:50.641
- Hi, Steven.
- Mr Levanstin ...

953
01:02:50.642 --> 01:02:51.905
Come eventually.

954
01:02:51.932 --> 01:02:54.936
I am very proud to see you
all back together again in the city.

955
01:02:54.937 --> 01:02:57.901
Suarez and wonderful,
organized tonight!

956
01:02:57.902 --> 01:03:00.654
It's great!

957
01:03:01.162 --> 01:03:05.480
You know what?
I will make you drunk.

958
01:03:05.481 --> 01:03:08.826
- Drink a shot.
- No, I do not drink, Steven, do not ...

959
01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:14.535
- I do not drink much.
- Drink! Drink! Drink!

960
01:03:17.295 --> 01:03:20.336
- Okay, let's go another round.
- I doubt it.

961
01:03:20.344 --> 01:03:22.969
KEB Look, you're not
sure if something happened.

962
01:03:22.970 --> 01:03:26.313
I woke up the next
and we were naked.

963
01:03:26.314 --> 01:03:28.939
Whatever it was,
I feel guilty.

964
01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:31.860
Kevin in France
if your wife

965
01:03:31.861 --> 01:03:35.368
to catch red-handed,
consider adultery.

966
01:03:38.297 --> 01:03:39.483
Here it is.

967
01:03:41.389 --> 01:03:42.659
I must go.

968
01:03:43.336 --> 01:03:47.951
Okay, get ready.
Wait, wait ...

969
01:03:47.952 --> 01:03:49.688
Coming!

970
01:03:51.255 --> 01:03:53.830
And fuck Levenstin sir!

971
01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:56.751
The more
re the best motherfucker.

972
01:04:00.824 --> 01:04:05.219
This sofa
is so soft.

973
01:04:05.439 --> 01:04:07.857
I feel like
Smurfs. The feel?

974
01:04:07.858 --> 01:04:10.707
Yes ... So ...
One, you can ...

975
01:04:13.117 --> 01:04:15.395
Hi guys,
Sorry ... late.

976
01:04:16.123 --> 01:04:19.425
- Hello.
- I brought something for you all.

977
01:04:19.426 --> 01:04:24.125
I made something ... "Dancing With The
Stars ", with Eugenia Manolidou.

978
01:04:24.126 --> 01:04:26.489
- The great Chris Ostraiker.
- My God!

979
01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:29.375
You must see this!
Who wants to see

980
01:04:29.376 --> 01:04:32.211
my baby waving
in the ass?

981
01:04:32.212 --> 01:04:35.253
- Yes!
- I definitely want.

982
01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:38.055
Online dating?
Are you working right?

983
01:04:38.056 --> 01:04:41.316
If you want something of quality, should
to get out to go fishing.

984
01:04:41.317 --> 01:04:45.924
Harpoon? What is this?
This will fish out pussies?

985
01:04:46.567 --> 01:04:48.788
These days my
say "beaver."

986
01:04:48.789 --> 01:04:50.941
I threw a couple of
gkomenakia with it.

987
01:04:50.942 --> 01:04:53.770
I'm sure!

988
01:04:53.863 --> 01:04:57.757
Jim, your dad is
much more cool than you.

989
01:04:57.758 --> 01:04:59.324
All right. Stifler, stop
getting drunk my father.

990
01:04:59.325 --> 01:05:02.246
No, wants to learn to harpoon.

991
01:05:02.247 --> 01:05:04.617
Kala. Come in. Opa Lucky.

992
01:05:04.618 --> 01:05:06.480
Let him get
own decisions.

993
01:05:06.481 --> 01:05:08.259
Stop it. Come.

994
01:05:08.429 --> 01:05:11.985
Do not listen to him. I want to
xeskouriasei the dick tonight.

995
01:05:11.986 --> 01:05:13.764
Go out there and
find any pussy.

996
01:05:13.765 --> 01:05:15.458
De Go!

997
01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:19.014
- No, no! Stifler ... Dad ...
- Exactly what I do.

998
01:05:19.015 --> 01:05:22.486
Stop, because mild
little more tonight ...

999
01:05:22.487 --> 01:05:24.899
- No, no, son.
- ... I can not let ...

1000
01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:29.845
Equal barely drank a glass.
You know I love you.

1001
01:05:30.616 --> 01:05:34.334
I love you, but you should ...

1002
01:05:36.248 --> 01:05:39.719
- Be relaxing.
- To relax? Dad, where are you going?

1003
01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.488
- Did you see him?
- Jim, just to entertain Aston.

1004
01:05:43.489 --> 01:05:47.884
And now we can
have fun.

1005
01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:55.803
Excuse me, excuse me.

1006
01:05:55.811 --> 01:05:57.835
Here's the bathroom?

1007
01:05:58.436 --> 01:06:02.535
You can not even have to admit
why are you so selfish ...

1008
01:06:03.602 --> 01:06:05.583
Leptaki ... waited half.

1009
01:06:05.803 --> 01:06:11.688
- Can you help?
- Whose are you?

1010
01:06:11.689 --> 01:06:13.841
Stifler's mother.

1011
01:06:15.457 --> 01:06:17.355
I am the father of Jim.

1012
01:06:18.592 --> 01:06:20.912
See you then asshole.

1013
01:06:39.254 --> 01:06:42.168
It's the most ridiculous thing
I've never seen me.

1014
01:06:50.052 --> 01:06:56.573
- Great, fuck you and the bodies!
- That was Chris Ostraiker!

1015
01:06:56.574 --> 01:06:57.801
Surely you kept an entire
season, but it's time

1016
01:06:57.802 --> 01:06:59.368
Thank you.

1017
01:06:59.453 --> 01:07:01.654
Now is the time,
Chris, where America

1018
01:07:01.655 --> 01:07:02.935
will decide whether
will remain.

1019
01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:05.046
- Are you ready?
- Yes. Let's see the results.

1020
01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:14.538
What? Gilbert
Gkotfri and not you?

1021
01:07:14.539 --> 01:07:15.682
Bullshit!

1022
01:07:15.852 --> 01:07:19.027
Chris, sorry buddy.
So ...

1023
01:07:19.028 --> 01:07:23.126
We saw you break them, but
it's time to collect.

1024
01:07:23.558 --> 01:07:24.530
Want to say something
last to the public?

1025
01:07:24.531 --> 01:07:25.674
Okay children.

1026
01:07:25.675 --> 01:07:27.158
We can
stop here.

1027
01:07:27.159 --> 01:07:28.681
What? Kidding now?

1028
01:07:28.682 --> 01:07:30.544
I have not seen this point.

1029
01:07:30.545 --> 01:07:32.577
<i> What I learned is
To be honest </ i>

1030
01:07:32.578 --> 01:07:36.598
<i> with myself.
Because that means dance. </ I>

1031
01:07:36.599 --> 01:07:41.969
<i> Honesty with ourselves, so
danced a little more if </ i>

1032
01:07:42.612 --> 01:07:46.542
<i> there would be no wars! </ i>

1033
01:07:47.990 --> 01:07:49.852
NO MORE WARS <i>. </ i>

1034
01:07:49.853 --> 01:07:52.978
This is pure politics.

1035
01:08:07.002 --> 01:08:08.355
Come.

1036
01:08:08.356 --> 01:08:10.508
If you want to view
me, tricked.

1037
01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:16.055
- Are you okay?
- You know when ...

1038
01:08:16.699 --> 01:08:20.416
When you lose something important
not feel well.

1039
01:08:20.551 --> 01:08:25.540
- Oz is just a show.
- I'm not talking about the show.

1040
01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:37.692
<i> - Heather, are you here?
- I come! </ I>

1041
01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:41.715
Oh my God, wait here.
Back.

1042
01:08:42.908 --> 01:08:46.380
You do not know how many times I entered
Steven's room and got ...

1043
01:08:46.381 --> 01:08:51.030
- To have sex with some girl.
- At least it was a real girl.

1044
01:08:51.292 --> 01:08:54.673
- What you say?
- Once I entered the kitchen and ...

1045
01:08:54.892 --> 01:08:56.671
Jim ... I can
fystikonei a pie.

1046
01:08:56.672 --> 01:08:58.660
My God!

1047
01:08:58.957 --> 01:09:02.167
He fell into
in 2 seconds.

1048
01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:09.215
I have something much better.

1049
01:09:09.216 --> 01:09:12.051
Once I came to my room
Steve and I got to put

1050
01:09:12.052 --> 01:09:14.162
My brush up his ass.

1051
01:09:16.214 --> 01:09:18.959
There was even a part of the handle!

1052
01:09:24.387 --> 01:09:26.250
No, no, no!

1053
01:09:27.944 --> 01:09:30.231
A beautiful woman like you

1054
01:09:30.232 --> 01:09:33.017
should not be
drink so much.

1055
01:09:33.576 --> 01:09:35.185
Neither too.

1056
01:09:38.488 --> 01:09:44.322
Then what would you say
one to run away?

1057
01:09:46.109 --> 01:09:48.097
You know, you do not have
to wait

1058
01:09:48.098 --> 01:09:50.384
Up to 30 years
see each other again.

1059
01:09:50.385 --> 01:09:52.968
You're right.
I could escort to

1060
01:09:52.969 --> 01:09:55.925
in one of your adventures.

1061
01:09:56.271 --> 01:10:00.674
- I am a good musician?
- Muse?

1062
01:10:00.675 --> 01:10:03.843
I think you will
more ...

1063
01:10:11.387 --> 01:10:12.869
All is well?

1064
01:10:16.003 --> 01:10:18.409
Better than ever.

1065
01:10:21.282 --> 01:10:23.482
Wait, I think
that we are not

1066
01:10:23.483 --> 01:10:25.804
appropriately dressed
for the occasion!

1067
01:10:26.532 --> 01:10:29.750
- Put this.
- Where are you going?

1068
01:10:29.751 --> 01:10:32.664
To change.
Come back soon!

1069
01:10:43.807 --> 01:10:47.991
- Hey assholes!
- What happened, man?

1070
01:10:48.889 --> 01:10:55.148
- Pink horde?
- The tsimpouklou Christine!

1071
01:10:56.553 --> 01:11:00.864
- Are you working right?
- What?

1072
01:11:07.817 --> 01:11:10.526
- Well.
- Wait, what the hell are you doing?

1073
01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:13.490
- You expect to get your pipe?
- Well, yes!

1074
01:11:13.491 --> 01:11:17.047
- I did.
- Wait a minute.

1075
01:11:17.048 --> 01:11:19.207
Look, I understand you,
ashamed of your body.

1076
01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:21.915
But do not worry.

1077
01:11:21.916 --> 01:11:24.160
I'll close the lights.

1078
01:11:24.161 --> 01:11:27.124
You're the asshole that he
you were in high school.

1079
01:11:27.125 --> 01:11:30.596
Expect to do everything?
While I will not get anything?

1080
01:11:30.597 --> 01:11:33.003
- We do.
- No, no, no!

1081
01:11:37.414 --> 01:11:40.886
Let's make a deal.

1082
01:11:40.887 --> 01:11:44.443
It will make you chyseis
and you the same as me.

1083
01:11:44.444 --> 01:11:47.949
- What do you think?
- Well.

1084
01:11:48.381 --> 01:11:52.141
- But I will put to work.
- Damn!

1085
01:11:52.324 --> 01:11:54.102
Time for action!

1086
01:11:57.744 --> 01:12:02.520
There you are!
In searching everywhere.

1087
01:12:02.782 --> 01:12:04.511
Listen to me, must be ...

1088
01:12:07.017 --> 01:12:10.904
- What are you doing?
- I take what is mine!

1089
01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:15.654
No, I just
I hear your voice.

1090
01:12:15.655 --> 01:12:18.745
Are you okay?
You sound nervous.

1091
01:12:18.746 --> 01:12:23.353
- Nervous?
- There you are!

1092
01:12:24.801 --> 01:12:29.203
No, no, no.
I must go now.

1093
01:12:29.204 --> 01:12:32.676
- But I will take a while.
- Okay.

1094
01:12:32.677 --> 01:12:35.174
<i> And do not worry, you will not see
The Gossip Girl, without you. </ i>

1095
01:12:35.175 --> 01:12:37.326
<i> - I miss you, baby.
- Me too. </ I>

1096
01:12:40.934 --> 01:12:44.229
Look, Vicky, on
with last night ...

1097
01:12:45.507 --> 01:12:48.597
I was ... not myself.
What happened ...

1098
01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:52.576
I do not know ... perhaps in the world
you are normal ...

1099
01:12:52.577 --> 01:12:55.473
What do you think happened?

1100
01:12:55.474 --> 01:12:57.591
Our clothes were
the floor, right?

1101
01:12:57.592 --> 01:13:00.844
Yes, it was wet, because
I got drunk and fell into the lake.

1102
01:13:00.894 --> 01:13:05.551
- Take care.
- So, we did not have sex?

1103
01:13:05.552 --> 01:13:09.355
- Of course not!
- Thank God!

1104
01:13:11.946 --> 01:13:14.625
Glad that you believe
I am such a person.

1105
01:13:14.626 --> 01:13:17.921
No!
Vicky, wait!

1106
01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:23.849
- Yes! My God! Jump in!
- One, stop!

1107
01:13:24.365 --> 01:13:27.073
- My God! Yes!
- A, get off me!

1108
01:13:27.074 --> 01:13:30.242
You pour! My God!

1109
01:13:31.563 --> 01:13:32.537
Heather ...

1110
01:13:36.009 --> 01:13:37.488
What the hell?

1111
01:13:37.523 --> 01:13:40.141
Have something with this slut?

1112
01:13:40.953 --> 01:13:43.698
Which calls, slut,
paliopoutanario?

1113
01:13:46.416 --> 01:13:49.626
- Stop!
- God!

1114
01:13:51.412 --> 01:13:54.325
What the hell, why
did you do this, MORI;

1115
01:13:55.223 --> 01:13:58.856
- Bastard!
- No, no. One, just wait!

1116
01:13:59.439 --> 01:14:03.114
Incidentally, gamithika
by Mario Lopez!

1117
01:14:08.373 --> 01:14:13.919
Nice.
Now it's my turn.

1118
01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:18.661
- Not this time.
- Hold on. And our agreement?

1119
01:14:18.662 --> 01:14:22.591
Now you know
is ... big hordes.

1120
01:14:29.713 --> 01:14:31.365
Disgusting!

1121
01:14:54.258 --> 01:14:58.195
I do not think think
I would be naive to sleep, right?

1122
01:14:58.196 --> 01:15:00.144
As long as you're mine,
I'm happy.

1123
01:15:00.145 --> 01:15:01.541
Geez, Kara!
What are you doing here?

1124
01:15:01.542 --> 01:15:04.082
The Strange friend, invited
me and my friends.

1125
01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:06.573
Incidentally, nice
uniform. Very wicked.

1126
01:15:07.894 --> 01:15:11.146
- Damn!
- Do not worry, I locked the door.

1127
01:15:13.949 --> 01:15:15.219
Geez!

1128
01:15:18.522 --> 01:15:22.924
- What the hell is going on here?
- AJ, what are you doing here?

1129
01:15:22.925 --> 01:15:25.210
In followed. Ought
to see with my eyes.

1130
01:15:25.211 --> 01:15:28.979
Fucks the first jet-ski
Now me and my girlfriend?

1131
01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:31.434
My God, no!
Nothing happened!

1132
01:15:31.435 --> 01:15:33.764
- Now the fucked, Sandler!
- Sandler?

1133
01:15:33.765 --> 01:15:35.789
What the dick?
Geez!

1134
01:15:36.644 --> 01:15:38.084
I'll kill you!

1135
01:15:41.471 --> 01:15:44.597
- What the hell are you wearing?
- Can you explain everything.

1136
01:15:45.876 --> 01:15:48.365
- Damn!
- Come on, get up!

1137
01:15:48.839 --> 01:15:53.157
We will not fight with you, okay?
It's stupid. I am an adult now.

1138
01:15:53.158 --> 01:15:56.452
Seriously, why you look like me
a milksop with pussy.

1139
01:15:56.926 --> 01:16:01.626
- Do not be a milksop, Jim.
- AJ, calm down. Okay?

1140
01:16:01.627 --> 01:16:03.616
What do you think
kariolakia you ...

1141
01:16:03.617 --> 01:16:05.986
... And you can fuck
nose at the party's Stifmaister?

1142
01:16:05.987 --> 01:16:08.824
Once referred to the
Stifmaister yourself as?

1143
01:16:08.825 --> 01:16:12.628
Why is the most pathetic
name never came!

1144
01:16:16.066 --> 01:16:18.224
- I'll kill you!
- To Come.

1145
01:16:18.225 --> 01:16:20.715
Steve, come on,
this is ridiculous.

1146
01:16:25.042 --> 01:16:27.701
- Stop!
- Where do you think you go, kiddo!

1147
01:16:31.690 --> 01:16:34.731
Yes! Do not mess with
1999 graduates, bitch!

1148
01:16:35.585 --> 01:16:37.363
Finch.

1149
01:16:37.364 --> 01:16:39.304
Nobody does not matter
my friends!

1150
01:16:53.836 --> 01:16:58.274
Xekavala husband
I palioskato!

1151
01:17:10.477 --> 01:17:12.344
Damn!
Cops!

1152
01:17:13.016 --> 01:17:16.361
We must leave here.
How do we go from here?

1153
01:17:16.362 --> 01:17:19.021
- I need an escape!
- Damn!

1154
01:17:19.198 --> 01:17:23.221
You want to be with him?
Great! It is all yours.

1155
01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:25.805
Let's do the hours.

1156
01:17:25.806 --> 01:17:28.133
Jim, what happens?

1157
01:17:28.134 --> 01:17:31.005
Sorry about that.
Can you explain.

1158
01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:33.721
Last night I met Kara,
Our neighbor the ...

1159
01:17:33.722 --> 01:17:36.601
... And was too drunk to
lead, so I went to my house.

1160
01:17:36.602 --> 01:17:42.395
Then started off his
clothes and touch me to ...

1161
01:17:42.446 --> 01:17:45.832
Well, I know that does not sound right,
but nothing happened, okay?

1162
01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:50.610
- I do not care at all this.
- Thank you ... much.

1163
01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:53.538
No, no, no.
Kara, wait, I did not mean that ...

1164
01:17:53.539 --> 01:17:56.800
Wait, Michelle. Is not
what do you think, okay?

1165
01:17:56.801 --> 01:18:01.238
I swear that I tried
to do the right thing and ...

1166
01:18:02.389 --> 01:18:04.709
You must believe me.
Michelle, please.

1167
01:18:05.438 --> 01:18:08.097
Not if you believe you or not.

1168
01:18:08.317 --> 01:18:10.772
I'm disappointed.

1169
01:18:10.773 --> 01:18:13.186
I'll stay in my grandmother.

1170
01:18:13.187 --> 01:18:15.253
- Michelle, wait a minute ...
- Jim.

1171
01:18:16.236 --> 01:18:19.284
- Ended the fight, children.
- It came about it.

1172
01:18:19.285 --> 01:18:21.986
We were on the stolen machine.

1173
01:18:23.604 --> 01:18:26.644
Paul Finch was arrested.

1174
01:18:28.388 --> 01:18:31.182
- Excellent!
- Sorry, organ.

1175
01:18:31.183 --> 01:18:32.958
He won the machine,
betting that

1176
01:18:32.959 --> 01:18:34.695
Argentina will take
the World Cup.

1177
01:18:34.696 --> 01:18:36.982
- I think you are wrong.
- Paul, what happens?

1178
01:18:36.983 --> 01:18:39.438
- What?
- Paul?

1179
01:18:39.439 --> 01:18:41.929
- Finch, just tell them it!
- Paul!

1180
01:18:43.589 --> 01:18:49.128
Once in the cell gamane
Tonight, think Kevin!

1181
01:18:52.354 --> 01:18:55.226
Michelle, I just
to ... please!

1182
01:19:02.221 --> 01:19:03.278
Dad?

1183
01:19:08.317 --> 01:19:13.185
- Dad? Dad, what are you doing?
- I do not seen!

1184
01:19:13.186 --> 01:19:15.917
I'm here.
I'm not here!

1185
01:19:15.918 --> 01:19:19.558
- Is it good?
- I do not know.

1186
01:19:19.559 --> 01:19:22.268
- What will we do with Finch?
- Finch Fuck him!

1187
01:19:22.269 --> 01:19:23.368
Ashton to pass the
night in jail.

1188
01:19:23.369 --> 01:19:24.844
Come now, Stifler.

1189
01:19:25.030 --> 01:19:30.230
- What a good friend you are.
- I? But you?

1190
01:19:31.508 --> 01:19:33.752
Not my call.
I do not send e-mails.

1191
01:19:33.753 --> 01:19:36.207
Not commented on
My page on Facebook.

1192
01:19:36.208 --> 01:19:38.579
I do not even told how to
come back for mating!

1193
01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.314
Because we knew, how
somehow ...

1194
01:19:40.315 --> 01:19:42.601
You will find ... somehow
to destroy everything.

1195
01:19:42.602 --> 01:19:43.999
Sorry, Jim.

1196
01:19:44.253 --> 01:19:47.428
I wanted to have fun this
Sat / kitchen, as we did in high school.

1197
01:19:47.429 --> 01:19:49.038
Yes, but we are not
in high school anymore.

1198
01:19:49.039 --> 01:19:50.942
You're trapped
in the past.

1199
01:19:50.943 --> 01:19:54.408
When you realize that
things is not like it used?

1200
01:20:01.573 --> 01:20:06.475
All right.
I guess the party is over.

1201
01:20:08.473 --> 01:20:09.659
Assholes.

1202
01:20:42.432 --> 01:20:48.225
The party was awesome!
I think a lot of fun.

1203
01:20:50.266 --> 01:20:53.603
Well, at least
one of us entertained.

1204
01:20:55.347 --> 01:20:58.219
- Nothing new from Michelle?
- No.

1205
01:20:58.566 --> 01:21:02.333
- He does not want to talk to me.
- What about coming together tonight?

1206
01:21:02.334 --> 01:21:04.662
He said he might come,
but maybe not.

1207
01:21:04.663 --> 01:21:08.593
What happens between you? Jim,
is something you want to talk?

1208
01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.682
All right.

1209
01:21:14.884 --> 01:21:22.031
How often do you and mom ...

1210
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:28.764
- You know ...
- This is the problem?

1211
01:21:29.026 --> 01:21:31.736
- You and Michelle, you have not ...
- Not lately.

1212
01:21:31.737 --> 01:21:32.923
No.

1213
01:21:36.352 --> 01:21:40.535
There is an erection problem?

1214
01:21:40.544 --> 01:21:44.481
Because sometimes, you
to gain a little time ...

1215
01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:47.148
- ... with the thumb of the hand.
- God.

1216
01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:49.689
- Just say. Well, is not it?
- No, no, that is.

1217
01:21:49.690 --> 01:21:56.168
Then it is good to have you in mind
you, because it never fails.

1218
01:21:56.169 --> 01:22:01.834
All right. No, things
in this section are good.

1219
01:22:02.393 --> 01:22:08.229
But since Evan was born,
moved away somewhat.

1220
01:22:08.321 --> 01:22:09.719
And since then
we found at all.

1221
01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.326
All right.

1222
01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:15.730
This is not a problem.
So do not worry.

1223
01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:17.931
- The know?
- Yes. Listen to me, Jim.

1224
01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:20.604
Before you were born, we did
with your mother every day.

1225
01:22:20.605 --> 01:22:21.917
No need to tell me that.

1226
01:22:21.918 --> 01:22:23.823
Sometimes even
and two or three times a day.

1227
01:22:23.824 --> 01:22:25.684
You know what happened
the 70s,

1228
01:22:25.685 --> 01:22:27.923
where many were
experiments.

1229
01:22:28.354 --> 01:22:33.139
Your mother liked to
says: "dive for dollars."

1230
01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:34.323
And that's something ...

1231
01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:35.968
No.
Sorry, but no need ...

1232
01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:38.729
I understand.
You do not want to go.

1233
01:22:38.730 --> 01:22:40.464
Yes, you do not need.

1234
01:22:40.465 --> 01:22:45.876
The point is that when you child
become a dad and mom.

1235
01:22:45.884 --> 01:22:50.449
But it is very important to
not cease to be spouses.

1236
01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:54.599
If you do this,
will come and sex.

1237
01:22:56.386 --> 01:22:58.332
This actually has a lot of sense.

1238
01:22:58.333 --> 01:23:01.762
Can not wait
until you find yourself alone.

1239
01:23:01.763 --> 01:23:05.524
We should make
free time.

1240
01:23:06.549 --> 01:23:09.638
Why do you think were going to
Jewish school 3 times a week?

1241
01:23:09.639 --> 01:23:13.872
Sundays until 15:00.
Thursdays, 16:00-19:00.

1242
01:23:13.873 --> 01:23:15.523
- Okay, I understand.
- Then why do you ask?

1243
01:23:15.524 --> 01:23:20.724
You know what you'll do fine.
Sorry to talk to you.

1244
01:23:20.775 --> 01:23:23.823
No, I exaggerate.
I'm sorry.

1245
01:23:23.824 --> 01:23:25.475
Just ...

1246
01:23:27.889 --> 01:23:32.496
... Thank you again.
Frankly I say.

1247
01:23:35.003 --> 01:23:36.569
Whenever you want.

1248
01:23:41.609 --> 01:23:44.360
Welcome, folks.
You will find tags

1249
01:23:44.361 --> 01:23:47.492
with your names.
Enjoy all.

1250
01:23:47.493 --> 01:23:49.567
- Ashley, good to see.
- Hey!

1251
01:23:49.568 --> 01:23:52.439
My God, Billy.
You look incredible.

1252
01:23:52.701 --> 01:23:55.573
Old was like a whale.
Bis, worried.

1253
01:23:55.793 --> 01:23:59.045
- Hello, children.
- Hey, Jim.

1254
01:24:00.409 --> 01:24:03.876
- Children. Where is A?
- He left this morning.

1255
01:24:03.877 --> 01:24:07.637
- Sorry.
- The Michelle?

1256
01:24:08.916 --> 01:24:12.811
- Not sure yet?
- Finch?

1257
01:24:12.812 --> 01:24:16.621
What happened? I called the department
over a thousand times.

1258
01:24:16.622 --> 01:24:18.653
I appreciate this a lot, Kevin.

1259
01:24:18.654 --> 01:24:22.076
But basically, the mother
I paid the guarantee.

1260
01:24:22.804 --> 01:24:26.698
Children, Fuck you.
The machine belonged to my boss.

1261
01:24:26.699 --> 01:24:29.324
I had promised to increase
but when I gave ...

1262
01:24:29.325 --> 01:24:30.510
So ... ...

1263
01:24:31.231 --> 01:24:33.812
Simply ... I borrowed.

1264
01:24:33.813 --> 01:24:36.812
The truth is that my life
not at all interesting.

1265
01:24:37.201 --> 01:24:40.196
I am an assistant director in
Staples / Beyond, in New Jersey.

1266
01:24:40.197 --> 01:24:43.788
I lied to the best
My friends and I apologize.

1267
01:24:44.558 --> 01:24:49.765
You know, Finch, because you lost all
and you got a boring job ...

1268
01:24:49.766 --> 01:24:53.102
Like all of us ... does not mean
that we should feel shame.

1269
01:24:53.255 --> 01:24:56.133
- Yes, it does not count any of that.
- Yes.

1270
01:24:56.134 --> 01:24:57.828
This means a lot
for me, gentlemen.

1271
01:24:57.829 --> 01:24:59.979
What happened to your arm?

1272
01:25:01.173 --> 01:25:06.119
Spilled hot coffee on
my time driving.

1273
01:25:07.482 --> 01:25:09.634
Hurt too much though!

1274
01:25:09.896 --> 01:25:11.582
- Yes.
- Geez, Finch.

1275
01:25:13.623 --> 01:25:15.543
See a child here.

1276
01:25:15.544 --> 01:25:17.618
So crazy?
Look.

1277
01:25:17.619 --> 01:25:19.559
Many memories.
1281
01:25:21.725 ??-> 01:25:22.953
Steve Stifler.

1278
01:25:23.419 --> 01:25:26.798
I wish to continue partaroume
with these children.

1279
01:25:30.364 --> 01:25:32.141
He showed no sign yet?

1280
01:25:32.142 --> 01:25:33.912
I do not occur.

1281
01:25:49.673 --> 01:25:50.985
Stifler.

1282
01:25:55.091 --> 01:25:56.827
How you found?

1283
01:25:56.828 --> 01:25:58.647
We asked your mom.

1284
01:25:58.648 --> 01:26:01.054
No, no, I did nothing.

1285
01:26:02.418 --> 01:26:05.500
I wanted to apologize.

1286
01:26:06.186 --> 01:26:09.311
What we said yesterday
night, do not we meant.

1287
01:26:09.751 --> 01:26:14.232
But. And I understand why.
You think I'm an asshole.

1288
01:26:18.982 --> 01:26:24.605
All right. In a
how are you little jerk.

1289
01:26:25.332 --> 01:26:28.839
But you're funny asshole.

1290
01:26:30.075 --> 01:26:33.116
But it ceases to be a jerk.

1291
01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:36.470
Yeah dude ...

1292
01:26:36.935 --> 01:26:38.331
Were you of the reasons
high school was gamato.

1293
01:26:38.332 --> 01:26:40.357
Yes ...
Was in high school fucks.

1294
01:26:41.381 --> 01:26:42.989
Yes, it was.
But since the end ...

1295
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:46.631
All began ... to find work,
be married to have children ...

1296
01:26:46.632 --> 01:26:49.535
... And other such bullshit.
Look at me now.

1297
01:26:49.536 --> 01:26:51.349
I'm the bitch that
Here's part.

1298
01:26:51.357 --> 01:26:53.937
Stifler is not
none of us perfect life.

1299
01:26:53.938 --> 01:26:55.794
Especially my own.

1300
01:26:55.802 --> 01:26:59.400
What do you say to keep the party
and go to intercourse?

1301
01:26:59.401 --> 01:27:00.841
Together.

1302
01:27:02.027 --> 01:27:06.211
What the hell
going on here? God.

1303
01:27:06.514 --> 01:27:08.334
This is the asshole.
You're not even close

1304
01:27:08.335 --> 01:27:10.452
to finish
your job ...

1305
01:27:10.453 --> 01:27:13.881
Hang out ... and here
talk to your buddies?

1306
01:27:13.882 --> 01:27:15.321
Sorry, but
can not explain.

1307
01:27:15.322 --> 01:27:16.635
No, Kevin!

1308
01:27:17.609 --> 01:27:21.623
- Allow me.
- Yes, Kevin, let's.

1309
01:27:21.971 --> 01:27:24.171
I hope you got good
excuse Safler.

1310
01:27:24.172 --> 01:27:26.662
Stifler my name, motherfucker!

1311
01:27:28.617 --> 01:27:30.395
Who the hell
think you are?

1312
01:27:30.396 --> 01:27:33.014
You're the dude
in front of your girlfriend?

1313
01:27:33.911 --> 01:27:36.612
Because we both know that
be with you for your money.

1314
01:27:36.706 --> 01:27:38.652
Definitely not your dick.

1315
01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:40.389
As anyone who has
pee next to you ...

1316
01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:43.345
Know ... it's like
little finger of a dwarf.

1317
01:27:44.242 --> 01:27:47.036
- This ... not true.
- It is not true ...

1318
01:27:47.037 --> 01:27:49.112
Yes it is!

1319
01:27:50.637 --> 01:27:54.870
Because you have a luxurious office,
I even chair ...

1320
01:27:54.871 --> 01:27:57.113
This does not change ...
they really are.

1321
01:27:57.114 --> 01:28:00.325
The truth is that
're still nerd ...

1322
01:28:01.179 --> 01:28:03.712
That ... and I can still
to break into the wood.

1323
01:28:04.017 --> 01:28:07.142
But I will not do
and you know why?

1324
01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:09.732
Because I am
Stifmaister fucking!

1325
01:28:09.733 --> 01:28:11.510
You can get
this work and

1326
01:28:11.511 --> 01:28:13.374
to put in
poutsotrypa you.

1327
01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:15.576
Because I have a
Bringing to run!

1328
01:28:15.577 --> 01:28:16.762
Guys!

1329
01:28:22.368 --> 01:28:25.755
Incidentally, there
I had a clue what I did here ...

1330
01:28:25.756 --> 01:28:28.880
So ... has very
work to do.

1331
01:29:03.737 --> 01:29:05.937
- Surprise.
- You did it!

1332
01:29:05.938 --> 01:29:07.123
Of course yes!

1333
01:29:07.124 --> 01:29:09.572
How about the Panatha
this year? I get it?

1334
01:29:09.580 --> 01:29:12.374
If you make the attack
them something to do.

1335
01:29:12.375 --> 01:29:15.210
We go back to "Dancing
With The Stars ";

1336
01:29:15.211 --> 01:29:16.463
I have not thought at all.

1337
01:29:16.464 --> 01:29:18.403
But it should!

1338
01:29:22.689 --> 01:29:26.830
Sorry, guys, but
have to forgive me.

1339
01:29:30.775 --> 01:29:32.673
Can I interrupt?

1340
01:29:32.892 --> 01:29:36.187
I do not know. Promise that
will not get undressed?

1341
01:29:36.408 --> 01:29:39.024
D Come to tease.

1342
01:29:39.117 --> 01:29:41.227
So?
Yes, of course.

1343
01:29:41.362 --> 01:29:43.344
- I'm going to get drinks.
- Okay.

1344
01:29:46.189 --> 01:29:48.509
- Hello.
- Hello.

Me and A, we are done.

1347
01:29:58.977 --> 01:30:04.226
He wanted to be someone else.

1348
01:30:04.227 --> 01:30:08.538
Someone who did not want to be.

1349
01:30:08.927 --> 01:30:11.460
And what do you want to be, Chris?

1350
01:30:11.976 --> 01:30:14.727
Heather, I want it.

1351
01:30:14.728 --> 01:30:16.633
I want us.

1352
01:30:17.599 --> 01:30:21.747
And what about your career?
In Los Angeles?

1353
01:30:21.748 --> 01:30:25.431
Look, I know

I love you.

1358
01:30:37.997 --> 01:30:40.402
And I love you.

1359
01:30:46.466 --> 01:30:48.921
Yes we were in the Metro
and suffered a heart

1360
01:30:48.922 --> 01:30:50.953
and I saved his life.
Large sousouro happened.

1361
01:30:50.954 --> 01:30:52.597
You can gkougklarete.

1362
01:30:52.775 --> 01:30:54.588
- Yes it was.
- The guess.

1363
01:30:55.697 --> 01:30:56.925
Damn.

1364
01:30:57.221 --> 01:30:58.111
Excuse me.

1365
01:30:58.407 --> 01:31:00.516
Sorry!
What the hell is happening?

1366
01:31:00.578 --> 01:31:03.542
- Ron, I can explain.
- Seriously? With this type?

1367
01:31:03.543 --> 01:31:05.827
I am a surgeon, he
The guy is not even on ESPN.

1368
01:31:05.828 --> 01:31:09.384
- To relax, Ron.
- What will you do, you hit me?

1369
01:31:09.385 --> 01:31:13.103
I have an idea. What would you say,
for a dance competition?

1370
01:31:14.678 --> 01:31:16.498
This is not a
reality shows, okay?

1371
01:31:16.499 --> 01:31:19.335
This is the real world.
If you give me a punch ...

1372
01:31:19.336 --> 01:31:21.318
I do ... I'll sue for
that you have in your name.

1373
01:31:25.306 --> 01:31:28.008
I do not have one, motherfucker!

1374
01:31:30.387 --> 01:31:32.285
I am an asshole!

1375
01:31:34.834 --> 01:31:37.415
- In Fuck you.
- And fuck!

1376
01:31:37.416 --> 01:31:39.869
Listen, we had a gamati
idea the other day.

1377
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:42.571
Have you ever considered becoming
party organizer?

1378
01:31:42.706 --> 01:31:45.366
Why do we want to organize
in our wedding party.

1379
01:31:46.094 --> 01:31:48.973
Yes of course!

1380
01:31:49.143 --> 01:31:51.343
- I like!
- Great!

1381
01:31:51.344 --> 01:31:52.530
Thank you.

1382
01:31:53.038 --> 01:31:54.901
Thank you.

1383
01:31:55.325 --> 01:31:57.815
- D Thanks bro.
- Please.

1384
01:32:03.752 --> 01:32:06.284
- I have to tell you something.
- I do not need to explain.

1385
01:32:06.546 --> 01:32:10.821
Look, Paul, I did not like
because they ascended the Alps ...

1386
01:32:10.822 --> 01:32:13.524
Or ... killed a camel
with bare hands.

1387
01:32:13.532 --> 01:32:16.707
I like it, because you still
the same nice guy ...

1388
01:32:16.708 --> 01:32:19.205
Me ... who was
basically good in high school.

1389
01:32:19.206 --> 01:32:22.077
I'm still this
guy. Frankly I am.

1390
01:32:23.398 --> 01:32:26.736
You know, the last time
I was here was in the dance.

1391
01:32:27.040 --> 01:32:30.801
- I had no escort.
- Neither do I.

1392
01:32:32.756 --> 01:32:35.289
- I'm going to get something to drink.
- What?

1393
01:32:35.678 --> 01:32:38.083
- Both dance crap?
- Yes.

1394
01:32:38.345 --> 01:32:39.234
KEB!

1395
01:32:39.531 --> 01:32:42.790
- Tses!
- Let beard I see!

1396
01:32:42.791 --> 01:32:44.738
- I go too.
- Thank you.

1397
01:32:44.739 --> 01:32:45.501
Kidding.

1398
01:32:45.755 --> 01:32:48.676
Well, to finish.
I am a lesbian now.

1399
01:32:48.677 --> 01:32:52.149
- From here, my girlfriend, Ingrid.
- I was very happy.

1400
01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:54.228
- I.
- Lesbian?

1401
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:56.980
I knew it! Why not kissed
to prove:

1402
01:32:56.981 --> 01:33:00.191
You must be a Stifler.
I've heard a lot about you.

1403
01:33:00.326 --> 01:33:03.705
- Mostly negative.
- Relax, dude, what the dick?

1404
01:33:04.476 --> 01:33:07.897
- Jessica, I was glad to see you.
- Not so.

1405
01:33:09.302 --> 01:33:12.138
KEB, I think we should go
to talk to Vicky.

1406
01:33:12.139 --> 01:33:14.206
It is very sad.

1407
01:33:14.342 --> 01:33:16.874
Yes ... thank you.

1408
01:33:17.178 --> 01:33:21.447
- I was very happy.
- Are you man enough! Do you have a beard!

1409
01:33:24.631 --> 01:33:27.044
Kevin, no!
I'm fine.

1410
01:33:27.045 --> 01:33:30.594
Come on. I was totally asshole
last night.

1411
01:33:30.983 --> 01:33:34.031
I am sad because
thought I would do that ...

1412
01:33:34.032 --> 01:33:36.056
Knowing ... that you're married.

1413
01:33:36.445 --> 01:33:37.969
I know you did not.

1414
01:33:37.970 --> 01:33:41.899
Frankly, I felt
more nervous.

1415
01:33:42.669 --> 01:33:46.810
When xanaeida, rekindled
old feelings in me and ...

1416
01:33:46.945 --> 01:33:50.070
I think I felt ... guilty.

1417
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:52.484
The fact that ...

1418
01:33:52.705 --> 01:33:55.413
I still have ...
feelings for you ...

1419
01:33:55.414 --> 01:33:57.869
Something ... that means it is
we have is special.

1420
01:33:57.870 --> 01:34:01.292
Do not get me wrong.
I love Eli ...

1421
01:34:02.062 --> 01:34:03.713
More ... than anything else.

1422
01:34:03.714 --> 01:34:08.957
As time passed though,
you will always be my first love.

1423
01:34:11.074 --> 01:34:13.564
And you're always mine.

1424
01:34:13.572 --> 01:34:16.577
KEB, should try this
of sweet biscuits. It's awful.

1425
01:34:16.578 --> 01:34:18.652
Ellie, Vicky from here.

1426
01:34:18.653 --> 01:34:21.362
My God!
H. .. Vicky?

1427
01:34:21.363 --> 01:34:23.176
Kevin, I have been told
so much for you.

1428
01:34:23.565 --> 01:34:27.071
You're very lucky girl.
It's terrible child.

1429
01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:29.281
- Come dance with us.
- No, it does not matter.

1430
01:34:29.282 --> 01:34:31.349
- I know ...
- Yes, come on!

1431
01:35:19.288 --> 01:35:20.644
My name is Jim.

1432
01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.065
We were together in class
Mr. Li's English.

1433
01:35:24.539 --> 01:35:25.809
Seriously?

1434
01:35:26.741 --> 01:35:31.010
Yes, but sorry.
They do not remember.

1435
01:35:32.204 --> 01:35:37.064
I was the kid that everyone
saw on the internet?

1436
01:35:38.894 --> 01:35:41.807
Sorry, you must be
little more accurate.

1437
01:35:42.197 --> 01:35:44.398
Who prematurely ejaculate 2 times?

1438
01:35:44.399 --> 01:35:46.718
- Jim Levenstin!
- Yes, I'm Levenstin.

1439
01:35:48.209 --> 01:35:49.725
Now I remembered.

1440
01:35:51.639 --> 01:35:57.855
- How are you doing after high school?
- Well. Pretty good actually.

1441
01:36:00.918 --> 01:36:03.662
I married the most
beautiful woman in the world.

1442
01:36:05.914 --> 01:36:08.362
And we have the most beautiful child.

1443
01:36:09.302 --> 01:36:12.215
Sounds like everything is perfect.

1444
01:36:13.027 --> 01:36:16.238
They are willing to do the
Always be on Telly.

1445
01:36:17.134 --> 01:36:21.107
And on this I will try
to be the sexiest wife.

1446
01:36:21.242 --> 01:36:22.978
Seriously?

1447
01:36:23.994 --> 01:36:28.178
- Michelle, you're beautiful.
- Thank you.

1448
01:36:29.583 --> 01:36:33.471
- Want to dance?
- We would love.

1449
01:36:54.608 --> 01:36:57.402
- Stifler?
- Sherman?

1450
01:36:57.403 --> 01:37:01.544
The Sermanothreftis?
What the dick did you?

1451
01:37:01.806 --> 01:37:03.923
I was married.
I was a kid ...

1452
01:37:03.924 --> 01:37:05.660
... And broke.

1453
01:37:07.311 --> 01:37:10.062
- Sorry.
- I'm sure sorry.

1454
01:37:10.063 --> 01:37:13.578
But you know what? Least
I kept the small Furlong.

1455
01:37:13.579 --> 01:37:16.922
You gave the name of Eddie
Furlong to your child?

1456
01:37:16.923 --> 01:37:19.378
Yes, and you know why?
Because the Terminator 2 ...

1457
01:37:19.379 --> 01:37:21.299
Is ... still the best
film ever made.

1458
01:37:21.300 --> 01:37:25.019
Dude, you must
fuck me urgently!

1459
01:38:02.048 --> 01:38:04.919
- You must leave here.
- Time was!

1460
01:38:09.881 --> 01:38:12.251
It's a lost cause.
These women ...

1461
01:38:12.252 --> 01:38:14.700
Or are married ...
are human or pig.

1462
01:38:16.614 --> 01:38:20.374
Dude, what would you say to
an incredible experience?

1463
01:38:31.084 --> 01:38:33.744
Hasta la vista, Stifler.

1464
01:38:38.749 --> 01:38:42.720
Perfect. everybody jump,
except me.

1465
01:38:43.152 --> 01:38:45.854
- Shit.
- Sorry ...

1466
01:38:48.826 --> 01:38:51.459
Seeking Paul Finch;
has seen him anywhere?

1467
01:38:51.460 --> 01:38:54.803
- What do you want to Finch?
- I came to get him.

1468
01:38:54.804 --> 01:38:57.549
I am his mother.
OUAAAA

1469
01:38:59.377 --> 01:39:01.952
Finch, a mother?

1470
01:39:02.892 --> 01:39:06.822
I mean ... you
Finch's mother:

1471
01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:11.395
- Yes. Are you friends?
- Yes!

1472
01:39:12.080 --> 01:39:15.799
Paul is my best
friend. I love him so much.

1473
01:39:16.315 --> 01:39:18.177
Now more than ever.

1474
01:39:18.178 --> 01:39:21.091
Basically, I do not think we
met. I'm Steven Stifler.

1475
01:39:24.402 --> 01:39:26.638
I'm Rachel.

1476
01:39:27.747 --> 01:39:29.864
What? What happened?

1477
01:39:30.160 --> 01:39:33.158
I feel that something very
bad will happen.

1478
01:39:33.548 --> 01:39:34.861
Do not worry.

1479
01:39:36.978 --> 01:39:39.214
I will be very quiet.

1480
01:39:51.968 --> 01:39:54.804
- Easy.
- I kaflosei!

1481
01:39:54.805 --> 01:39:56.963
- Yes!
- Yes!

1482
01:39:58.022 --> 01:39:59.716
These are!

1483
01:39:59.801 --> 01:40:02.375
- I do not think I can hold on!
- Keep the inside of you!

1484
01:40:04.797 --> 01:40:06.907
Also, I forgot how
I have missed.

1485
01:40:11.064 --> 01:40:14.275
Oh my God, Michelle!
I love you!

1486
01:40:14.367 --> 01:40:15.595
Jim?

1487
01:40:16.715 --> 01:40:19.043
Nadia?

1488
01:40:23.151 --> 01:40:27.165
Sorry! You
busy, right?

1489
01:40:27.386 --> 01:40:29.163
- Yes?
- Yes.

1490
01:40:30.053 --> 01:40:31.450
Nadia ...

1491
01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:32.847
I am very pleased ... to see you.

1492
01:40:32.848 --> 01:40:35.811
But you think you can
forgive us for a minute?

1493
01:40:35.812 --> 01:40:37.583
- Three!
- Three minutes.

1494
01:40:37.591 --> 01:40:38.857
All right.

1495
01:40:39.108 --> 01:40:41.224
It's nice that
're still together.

1496
01:40:41.225 --> 01:40:44.773
And I see that you have
improved greatly in this.

1497
01:40:45.841 --> 01:40:47.154
Thank you.

1498
01:40:52.658 --> 01:40:55.614
This is Jim? None
compared with what you say.

1499
01:40:56.935 --> 01:41:02.056
You know, when I was in high school
I went out with one of the lacrosse player.

1500
01:41:02.057 --> 01:41:03.751
Basically, I went out with
many of them.

1501
01:41:03.752 --> 01:41:05.987
What you're saying now.

1502
01:41:06.376 --> 01:41:09.361
Paul always wanted to
involved in sports,

1503
01:41:09.362 --> 01:41:12.847
but it never interested him.

1504
01:41:13.152 --> 01:41:16.277
Needless to
sweetens, Finch is chicken.

1505
01:41:18.741 --> 01:41:21.873
Yes, but not
got that from me.

1506
01:41:21.874 --> 01:41:25.389
I was head cheerleader.

1507
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:29.531
And if I learned something from them
lacrosse players, is that ...

1508
01:41:30.004 --> 01:41:33.171
I like to ...
playing with sticks.

1509
01:41:33.730 --> 01:41:36.686
And playing with balls.

1510
01:41:39.904 --> 01:41:41.395
I love you.

1511
01:41:41.903 --> 01:41:44.817
Are you ready for me, Stifler?

1512
01:41:48.804 --> 01:41:50.371
Yes!

1513
01:41:51.430 --> 01:41:52.828
Go.

1514
01:41:54.098 --> 01:41:55.326
Michelle!

1515
01:41:56.951 --> 01:41:59.696
You are amazing!

1516
01:41:59.872 --> 01:42:01.395
Best and the
tilefonaki the bathroom?

1517
01:42:01.396 --> 01:42:03.082
Much better!

1518
01:42:03.852 --> 01:42:06.300
And better than that?

1519
01:42:14.099 --> 01:42:17.401
- Take it.
- Should not do that.

1520
01:42:17.402 --> 01:42:20.620
- Yet!
- Stifler!

1521
01:42:20.621 --> 01:42:22.688
Finch's mom!

1522
01:42:23.415 --> 01:42:28.150
- Call me Stifmaister!
- Yes, you're the Stifmaister!

1523
01:42:29.767 --> 01:42:30.783
Milf ...

1524
01:42:39.378 --> 01:42:40.733
Milf.

1525
01:42:42.512 --> 01:42:44.078
Milf.

1526
01:42:46.915 --> 01:42:50.337
<i> - Tell me I'm the best.
- You're the best! </ I>

1527
01:42:50.853 --> 01:42:52.378
Milf.

1528
01:42:52.759 --> 01:42:53.902
Milf!

1529
01:42:54.029 --> 01:42:55.765
Milf!

1530
01:43:07.113 --> 01:43:10.789
<i> - Your son is xeneroto!
- Stop talking about him! </ I>

1531
01:43:12.168 --> 01:43:15.131
Our first reunion
passed and the official story!

1532
01:43:15.132 --> 01:43:18.561
I do not know about you, but the
My evening ended very nicely.

1533
01:43:18.562 --> 01:43:20.551
- It was wonderful.
- I saw it all!

1534
01:43:20.552 --> 01:43:23.473
- It was unforgettable.
- Yes! He finished as a racehorse!

1535
01:43:23.474 --> 01:43:26.473
What happened to you, Stifler?
What has?

1536
01:43:26.862 --> 01:43:29.461
A gentleman does not say
ever its secrets, Jim.

1537
01:43:32.705 --> 01:43:33.763
Children ...

1538
01:43:35.119 --> 01:43:37.100
... Coming back.

1539
01:43:51.844 --> 01:43:54.637
Sorry for what
I said the other day.

1540
01:43:54.638 --> 01:43:58.103
No, I should
to apologize.

1541
01:43:58.407 --> 01:43:59.845
I can not believe
how they behaved that way.

1542
01:43:59.846 --> 01:44:01.363
I feel ashamed.

1543
01:44:01.922 --> 01:44:03.064
You do not.

1544
01:44:03.065 --> 01:44:06.409
When I was your age,
I was too obsessed with sex.

1545
01:44:06.410 --> 01:44:07.368
I know.

1546
01:44:07.414 --> 01:44:08.896
I saw on YouTube.

1547
01:44:08.897 --> 01:44:11.811
Of course you saw.

1548
01:44:12.073 --> 01:44:14.182
But thank you
for understanding.

1549
01:44:14.444 --> 01:44:17.061
Think about it and you were right.

1550
01:44:17.069 --> 01:44:19.347
Better to wait
for someone special.

1551
01:44:20.372 --> 01:44:23.666
It is difficult to find
good as someone like you.

1552
01:44:25.538 --> 01:44:28.621
Well, I'm
sure you will find.

1553
01:44:34.896 --> 01:44:37.224
I feel like a new man
after this weekend.

1554
01:44:37.225 --> 01:44:38.409
Is that shit
have to go.

1555
01:44:38.410 --> 01:44:39.722
Not me.

1556
01:44:40.315 --> 01:44:43.864
I'll leave from my job
and arrives shortly with Heather.

1557
01:44:43.957 --> 01:44:45.700
- Beautiful!
- You, Finch?

1558
01:44:45.701 --> 01:44:49.046
The Selina and I are planning
a short trip to Europe.

1559
01:44:49.047 --> 01:44:51.960
To get the phone
Your mother. Miss the most.

1560
01:44:52.985 --> 01:44:54.297
How do you know?

1561
01:44:59.929 --> 01:45:02.130
I think I finished it.
Back to reality?

1562
01:45:02.131 --> 01:45:04.458
You should not expect
until the next mating.

1563
01:45:04.459 --> 01:45:07.550
It should
we are every year.

1564
01:45:07.551 --> 01:45:10.428
What you say?
Until next time?

1565
01:45:10.429 --> 01:45:13.555
- Until next time.
- Until next time.

1566
01:45:22.328 --> 01:45:24.818
- I jumped the mother Finch!
- What?

1567
01:45:25.123 --> 01:45:26.732
What?
