<i> It's been a while since I was</i>

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:28.265
<i> ...up here in front of you maybe i'll stick to the cards</i>

00:00:30.934 --> 00:00:35.150
<i>There's been speculation that I was involved in the events
that occurred on the freeway and the rooftop.</i>

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.800
<i>I'm sorry, Mr. Stark, but do you
honestly expect us to believe that</i>

00:00:38.861 --> 00:00:40.887
<i>that was  bodyguard
in a suit</i>

00:00:40.948 --> 00:00:44.765
<i> that conveniently appeared,
despite the fact that you historically despise bodyguards?</i>

00:00:44.807 --> 00:00:46.310
<i> Yes.</i>

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:48.939
<i>And this mysterious bodyguard was...</i>

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.838
<i>...somehow equipped with...</i>

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.398
<i>...an undisclosed Stark high-tech
powered battle suit?</i>

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.933
<i> I know that it's confusing.</i>

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.557
<i>It is one thing
to question the official story</i>

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.112
<i> and another thing entirely to make wild accusations
or insinuate that I'm a superhero.</i>

00:01:06.413 --> 00:01:10.068
<i>I mean, let's face it I'm not,
the heroic type.</i>

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.453
<i> I've a laundry list of character defects,
all the mistakes that I've made...</i>

00:01:13.454 --> 00:01:15.513
<i>largely public.</i>

00:01:15.562 --> 00:01:17.044
<i> The truth is...</i>

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:23.517
<i> ...I am Iron Man.</i>

00:01:28.316 --> 00:01:29.616
Ivan ...

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:35.524
Ivan?

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.514
That should be you.

00:02:04.697 --> 00:02:07.193
Do not listen to these morons.

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:11.281
I'm sorry.

00:02:12.344 --> 00:02:16.506
I can only offer you
my knowledge.

00:04:37.702 --> 00:04:41.195
<i> Iron Man stabilizes East-West relations</i>

00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:21.601

00:05:21.602 --> 00:05:24.561
<i>You are clear for exfiltration

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:28.892
Six months later

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:26.117
It's good to be back!

00:07:27.753 --> 00:07:28.996
You missed me.

00:07:28.997 --> 00:07:31.892
- Blow something up!
- Blow something up?

00:07:31.917 --> 00:07:33.458
I already did that.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.677
I'm not saying that the world is enjoying...

00:07:37.678 --> 00:07:40.166
...its longest period of
uninterrupted peace in years...

00:07:40.171 --> 00:07:41.768
because of me.

00:07:44.646 --> 00:07:46.669
I'm not saying...

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:50.605
...that from the ashes of captivity...

00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:55.158
...never has a greater Phoenix metaphor
been personified in human history.

00:07:58.358 --> 00:08:00.033
I'm not saying...

00:08:00.182 --> 00:08:04.295
...that Uncle Sam can kick back
on a lawn chair,...

00:08:04.296 --> 00:08:06.320
...sipping on iced tea,...

00:08:06.382 --> 00:08:09.136
...because I haven't come across anyone
who's man enough...

00:08:09.137 --> 00:08:12.119
...to go toe to toe with me
on my best day!

00:08:16.489 --> 00:08:19.704
- I love you Tony!
- Please. It's not about me.

00:08:21.236 --> 00:08:23.598
It's not about you.

00:08:25.329 --> 00:08:28.396
It's not even about us.
It's about legacy.

00:08:29.302 --> 00:08:32.243
It's about what we choose to leave behind
for future generations.

00:08:32.244 --> 00:08:34.414
And that's why for the next year...

00:08:34.434 --> 00:08:36.501
and for the first time since 1974,...

00:08:36.502 --> 00:08:38.584
...the best and brightest men and women

00:08:38.588 --> 00:08:40.988
...of nations and corporations the world over...

00:08:40.989 --> 00:08:44.466
will pool their resources
share their collective vision,

00:08:44.467 --> 00:08:47.638
to leave behind
a brighter future.

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:49.407
It's not about us!

00:08:50.303 --> 00:08:53.488
Therefore, what I am saying,
if I'm saying anything,

00:08:53.489 --> 00:08:56.395
...is welcome back to the Stark Expo!

00:09:00.071 --> 00:09:03.606
Now, making a special guest appearance
from the great beyond,

00:09:03.616 --> 00:09:05.025
to tell you what it's all about,

00:09:05.236 --> 00:09:08.112
please welcome my father, Howard.

<i>Everything is achievable through technology.</i>

00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:15.645
<i> Better living.
Robust health.</i>

00:09:15.646 --> 00:09:18.127
<i> And for the first time in human history,</i>

00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:20.214
<i> the possibility of world peace.</i>

00:09:20.215 --> 00:09:24.478
<i> So from all of us here at Stark Industries,
I would like to personally introduce you to</i>

00:09:24.479 --> 00:09:26.791
<i> The city of the future.</i>

00:09:27.429 --> 00:09:30.787
<i> technology holds infinite possibilities
for mankind.</i>

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:37.649
<i> soon, technology will affect
the way you live your life every day.</i>

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.538
<i> No more tedious work,</i>

00:09:39.633 --> 00:09:42.145
<i> leaving more time,
leisure activities</i>

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.106
<i> and enjoying sweet life.</i>

<i>The Stark Expo.
Welcome.</i>

00:09:52.286 --> 00:09:54.356
We are coming to you live from the kick-off
of the Stark Expo

00:09:54.373 --> 00:09:57.849
where Tony Stark
has just walked onstage.

00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.908
Don't worry if you can't make it down here now,

00:09:59.936 --> 00:10:01.995
because this expo goes on all year long.

00:10:01.996 --> 00:10:04.177
And I'm gonna be here checking out
all the attractions

00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:08.141
and the pavillions and the inventions
from all around the world.

00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.996
It's a zoo out there, watch out alright.

00:10:10.002 --> 00:10:11.800
Open up. Let's go.

00:10:11.975 --> 00:10:14.169
Nice to see you, alright.

00:10:14.176 --> 00:10:15.660
Thank you.
I remember you.

00:10:17.608 --> 00:10:19.154
- Call me.
- Hey, come on ...

00:10:19.572 --> 00:10:20.535
Hi there, dear friend.

00:10:20.537 --> 00:10:22.759
It'll be a pleasure.

00:10:23.086 --> 00:10:25.753
- See ya buddy.
- This is Larry.

00:10:25.754 --> 00:10:28.476
The oracle of goracle.
What a pleasure, nice to see you.

00:10:28.477 --> 00:10:29.931
Call me.

00:10:29.932 --> 00:10:31.128
- Larry King.
- Larry!

00:10:31.716 --> 00:10:34.170
Yes, my people, my people.

00:10:34.171 --> 00:10:37.041
- Did it go pretty mellow?
- It wasn't so bad.

00:10:37.042 --> 00:10:38.941
- No, it's perfect.

00:10:39.049 --> 00:10:40.978
Look what we got here,
the new model.

00:10:41.208 --> 00:10:42.813
- Hey, does she come with the car?
- I certainly hope so.

00:10:42.814 --> 00:10:44.134
Hi. And you are?

00:10:44.135 --> 00:10:46.192
- Marshall. - Irish. I like it.
- Pleased to meet you Tony

00:10:46.193 --> 00:10:48.120
I'm on the wheel, you mind?

00:10:48.494 --> 00:10:49.737
- Where you from?
- Bedford.

00:10:49.738 --> 00:10:51.130
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

00:10:51.198 --> 00:10:53.737
Yeah? You found me.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:57.263
- What are you up to later?
- Serving subpoenas.

00:10:57.986 --> 00:11:00.167
Yikes.

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:03.066
- He doesn't like to be handed things.
- Yeah I have a peeve.

00:11:03.067 --> 00:11:06.600
You are hereby ordered to appear before
the Senate Armed Services Committee

00:11:06.601 --> 00:11:08.216
tomorrow morning at 9 am.

00:11:08.217 --> 00:11:11.232
- Can I see a badge? - You wanna see the badge?
- He likes the badge.

00:11:12.358 --> 00:11:14.576
- You still like it?
- Yup.

00:11:16.481 --> 00:11:18.794
- How far are we from D.C.?
- D.C.?

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.515
250 miles.

00:11:22.639 --> 00:11:26.565
Mr. Stark, can we pick up now
where we left off?

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:28.077
Mr. Stark?

00:11:28.354 --> 00:11:29.514
- Please.
- Yes, dear?

00:11:29.515 --> 00:11:31.303
- Can I have your attention?
- Absolutely.

00:11:31.305 --> 00:11:34.574
Do you or do you not possess a specialized weapon?

00:11:34.575 --> 00:11:36.442
- I do not.
- You do not?

00:11:36.443 --> 00:11:40.460
- I do not, well it depends how you define
the word weapon. - The Iron Man weapon.

00:11:40.461 --> 00:11:42.569
My device does not fit
that description.

00:11:42.570 --> 00:11:47.136
- Well, how would you describe your..?
- I would describe it by defining it as what it is, sir.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.973
- As?
- It's a high-tech prosthesis.

00:11:51.655 --> 00:11:54.732
That is, that's actually the most apt description
I could make of it.

00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:59.879
- It's a weapon Mr Stark I hate to inform you it's a weapon.
- Please, if your priority was actually the well-being...

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.728
My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon
turned over to the people of the United States of America.

00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:06.395
Well, you can forget it.

00:12:06.503 --> 00:12:10.567
I am Iron Man.
The suit and I are one.

00:12:10.568 --> 00:12:13.701
To turn over the Iron Man suit would be
to turn over myself, which is tantamount to

00:12:13.806 --> 00:12:15.534
indentured servitude or prostitution

00:12:15.683 --> 00:12:17.703
depending on what state you're in.

00:12:17.774 --> 00:12:21.024
- I can't have it.
- Look, I am no expert.

00:12:21.025 --> 00:12:23.449
In prostitution? Of course not,
you're a senator, come on!

00:12:25.814 --> 00:12:28.080
I'm not an expert in weapons.

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:31.976
But we have somebody here who is an expert
on weapons. I would now like to call Justin Hammer

00:12:31.987 --> 00:12:35.558
Our current primary weapons contractor.

00:12:35.599 --> 00:12:39.520
Let the record reflect that I observe
Mr. Hammer entering the chamber

00:12:39.521 --> 00:12:40.865
and I am wondering...

00:12:40.866 --> 00:12:46.015
if and when any
actual expert will also be in attendance.

00:12:48.754 --> 00:12:51.045
Absolutely. I am no expert.

00:12:51.049 --> 00:12:53.056
I defer to you, Anthony.

00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:54.903
You're the wonder boy.

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.750
Senator, if I may...

00:12:56.949 --> 00:13:01.476
I may well not be an expert,
but you know who was the expert?

00:13:01.537 --> 00:13:03.218
Your dad!

00:13:03.298 --> 00:13:06.515
Howard Stark.
Really a father to us all.

00:13:06.531 --> 00:13:09.227
and to the millitary-industrial age.

00:13:09.435 --> 00:13:13.566
Let's just be clear, he was no flower child.
He was a lion.

00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:15.213
We all know why we are here:

00:13:15.214 --> 00:13:17.083
In the last six months,

00:13:17.092 --> 00:13:20.941
Anthony Stark has created
a sword with untold possibilities.

00:13:21.087 --> 00:13:23.812
And yet I insists it's a shield.

00:13:24.094 --> 00:13:26.487
He asks us to trust him

00:13:26.493 --> 00:13:28.468
as we cower behind it.

00:13:28.758 --> 00:13:31.803
I wish I were comforted, Anthony.
I really do.

00:13:32.131 --> 00:13:34.905
I'd like to leave my door unlocked
when I leave the house,

00:13:34.947 --> 00:13:36.574
but this ain't Canada.

00:13:36.612 --> 00:13:38.243
You know we live in a world
of grave threats,

00:13:38.282 --> 00:13:42.415
threats that Mr. Stark
will not always be able to foresee.

00:13:43.021 --> 00:13:46.981
Thank you. God bless
Iron Man, God bless America.

00:13:48.946 --> 00:13:50.911
Well said, Mr. Hammer.

00:13:51.089 --> 00:13:53.634
The committee would now like to invite

00:13:53.697 --> 00:13:56.106
Lieut. Col. James Rhodes to the chamber.

00:13:56.107 --> 00:13:57.505
Rhodey?

00:14:03.611 --> 00:14:07.145
Hey, buddy. Didn't expect
to see you here.

00:14:07.155 --> 00:14:10.877
Look, it's me. I'm here. Deal with it.
Let's move on.

00:14:10.930 --> 00:14:12.427
- I just ...
- Drop it. - Alright, I'll drop it.

00:14:12.484 --> 00:14:16.030
I have before me a complete report on
the Iron Man weapon

00:14:16.134 --> 00:14:17.698
compiled by Colonel Rhodes.

00:14:17.699 --> 00:14:22.404
and Colonel, for the record,
can you please read page 57, paragraph 4?

00:14:22.405 --> 00:14:25.249
You're requesting that I read specific selections
from my report, senator?

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:25.915
Yes, sir.

00:14:25.916 --> 00:14:30.328
My understanding that I was going to be
testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.

00:14:30.329 --> 00:14:32.147
I understand, a lot of things have changed today.

00:14:32.148 --> 00:14:35.970
You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of
context does not reflect the summary of my finding?

00:14:35.971 --> 00:14:38.751
Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

00:14:40.222 --> 00:14:41.530
Very well.

00:14:43.169 --> 00:14:46.920
As he does not operate within any
definable branch of government,

00:14:48.782 --> 00:14:52.772
The Iron Man presents a potential threat
to the security of both the nation

00:14:53.052 --> 00:14:54.376
and to her interests.

00:14:54.606 --> 00:14:59.392
I did, however, go on to summarize that the benefits
of Iron Man far outweigh the liabilities

00:14:59.458 --> 00:15:01.090
and that it would be in our interest

00:15:01.127 --> 00:15:04.220
to fold Mr Stark into the existing
chain of command.

00:15:04.221 --> 00:15:07.799
I'm not a joiner but I'll consider Secretary of
Defense, if you ask nice.

00:15:08.051 --> 00:15:09.878
We can amend the hours a little bit.

00:15:11.136 --> 00:15:15.249
I'd like to go on and show, if I may,
the imagery that's connected to your report.

00:15:15.250 --> 00:15:20.057
I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal
these images to the general public at this time.

00:15:20.148 --> 00:15:23.279
With all due respect, Colonel, I understand.
And if you could just narrate those for us,

00:15:23.382 --> 00:15:25.156
we'd be very grateful.

00:15:25.852 --> 00:15:27.084
Show the images.

00:15:29.119 --> 00:15:32.181
Intelligence suggests that the
devices seen in these photos

00:15:32.182 --> 00:15:34.756
are in fact attempts at making manned copies

00:15:34.789 --> 00:15:36.895
of Mr. Stark's suit.

00:15:36.896 --> 00:15:39.971
This has been corroborated by our allies

00:15:40.025 --> 00:15:41.713
and local intelligence on the ground

00:15:41.714 --> 00:15:44.139
indicating that these suits are

00:15:44.218 --> 00:15:47.163
quite possibly at this moment operational.

00:15:47.585 --> 00:15:49.290
Hold on a second buddy, let me see.

00:15:50.293 --> 00:15:52.574
There's something here.
Oh, boy I'm good.

00:15:52.587 --> 00:15:54.555
Now can I get more screens.

00:15:55.478 --> 00:15:58.478
I need them.
Time for a little transparency.

00:15:58.529 --> 00:16:00.372
- Let's see what's really going on.
- What is he doing?

00:16:00.373 --> 00:16:02.972
If you'll direct your attention to said screens,

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.580
I believe that's North Korea.

00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:16.422
Can you turn that off? Take it off.

00:16:16.423 --> 00:16:18.448
Iran.

00:16:20.957 --> 00:16:23.821
No grave, immediate threat here.

00:16:23.878 --> 00:16:25.804
Is that Justin Hammer?

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:28.491
How did Hammer get in here?

00:16:28.492 --> 00:16:30.462
Justin, you're on TV, focus up.

00:16:41.919 --> 00:16:46.166
Wow. Yeah, I'd say most countries, 5-10 years away.

00:16:46.249 --> 00:16:50.266
- Hammer Industries 20.
- I'd like to point out that that test pilot survived.

00:16:50.267 --> 00:16:53.518
I think we got the point that he's making.
I don't think there's any reason...

00:16:53.605 --> 00:16:55.186
The point is you're welcome, I guess.

00:16:55.187 --> 00:16:57.785
- For what?
- Because, I'm your nuclear deterrent.

00:16:58.099 --> 00:17:00.364
It's working. We're safe.
America is secure.

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:02.555
You want my property?
You can't have it!

00:17:02.556 --> 00:17:04.743
But did I you a big favor.

00:17:04.746 --> 00:17:07.424
I've successfully privatized world peace.

00:17:10.535 --> 00:17:11.974
What more do you want?

00:17:12.411 --> 00:17:13.743
For now!

00:17:14.365 --> 00:17:17.190
I'm tired of all of these ass clowns!

00:17:17.661 --> 00:17:20.194
Fuck you Mr Stark.
Fuck you buddy.

00:17:20.741 --> 00:17:23.046
- We're adjourned, we're adjourned for today.
- Okay

00:17:23.384 --> 00:17:25.124
You've been a delight.

00:17:30.696 --> 00:17:32.687
<i> My bond is with the people.</i>

00:17:32.883 --> 00:17:34.937
<i> And I will serve this great nation</i>

00:17:34.969 --> 00:17:38.650
<i> at the pleasure of myself.</i>

00:17:38.962 --> 00:17:41.974
<i> One thing I've proven
is that you can count on me ...</i>

00:17:42.304 --> 00:17:43.581
<i> ...to pleasure myself.</i>

00:18:19.097 --> 00:18:22.173
- Wake up, daddy's home.
- Welcome home, sir.

00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.931
Congratulations on the opening ceremonies.
They were such a success.

00:18:24.973 --> 00:18:27.038
as was your Senate hearing.

00:18:27.398 --> 00:18:32.128
And may I say how refreshing it is to finally
see you in a video with your clothing on, sir?

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:36.483
You!

00:18:37.038 --> 00:18:40.556
I swear to god I'll dismantle you, I'll switch
your motherboard and turn you into wine rack.

00:18:42.389 --> 00:18:45.494
How many ounces a day of this gargle
am I supposed to drink?

00:18:45.495 --> 00:18:49.188
We are up to 80 ounces a day
to counteract the symptoms, sir.

00:18:50.646 --> 00:18:52.420
Check palladium levels.

00:18:54.601 --> 00:18:57.175
Blood toxicity: 24%

00:18:58.264 --> 00:19:02.599
It appears that the continued use of the
Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition.

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:06.788
Another core has been depleted.

00:19:10.548 --> 00:19:12.053
God, they're running out quick.

00:19:12.299 --> 00:19:14.775
I have run simulations
on every known element

00:19:14.776 --> 00:19:18.386
and none can serve as a viable replacement for
the palladium core.

00:19:21.336 --> 00:19:23.584
You are running out of both time
and options.

00:19:28.178 --> 00:19:32.079
Unfortunately, the device
that's keeping you alive, is also killing you.

00:19:34.096 --> 00:19:37.042
Ms. Potts is approaching.
I recommended that you inform her of...

00:19:37.043 --> 00:19:38.324
Mute.

00:19:41.742 --> 00:19:43.039
Is this a joke?

00:19:44.676 --> 00:19:45.891
What are you thinking?

00:19:45.928 --> 00:19:47.536
- What?
- What are you thinking?

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.738
Hey, I'm thinking I'm busy
and you're angry about something.

00:19:51.228 --> 00:19:52.642
Do you have the sniffles? I don't wanna get sick.
Keep your distance

00:19:52.643 --> 00:19:57.322
Did you just donate our entire
modern art collection to the...

00:19:57.812 --> 00:19:59.688
- Boy Scouts of America?
- Yes it is a...

00:19:59.689 --> 00:20:01.463
worthwhile organization.

00:20:01.464 --> 00:20:04.825
I didn't physically check the crates,
but basically yes.

00:20:04.826 --> 00:20:07.061
And it's not our collection, it's my collection. No offense.

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:10.806
No, you know what I think I'm actually entitled to say
Our collection,

00:20:10.807 --> 00:20:15.012
considering the time that I've put in
over 10 years curating that.

00:20:15.013 --> 00:20:16.256
It's a tax write-off, I needed that.

00:20:16.258 --> 00:20:18.525
You know, there's only about 8,011 things

00:20:18.553 --> 00:20:21.341
that I really need to talk to you about.

00:20:21.342 --> 00:20:24.391
Dummy, hey stop now the bridgeport's already
machining that part.

00:20:24.425 --> 00:20:26.724
The expo is a gigantic waste of time.

00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:30.434
- I need you to wear a surgical mask until
you're feeling better is that okay? - That's rude.

00:20:30.435 --> 00:20:32.071
There's nothing more important to me than the Expo.

00:20:32.103 --> 00:20:33.552
It's my primary point of concern. I don't know why you...

00:20:33.553 --> 00:20:36.875
The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

00:20:37.021 --> 00:20:38.558
Wow, look at that.

00:20:39.579 --> 00:20:42.522
That's modern art.
That's going up.

00:20:42.541 --> 00:20:44.343
- You've got to be kidding me.
- I'm gonna put this up right now.

00:20:44.908 --> 00:20:47.670
Stark is in complete disarray. Do you understand that?

00:20:47.724 --> 00:20:49.828
No, our stocks have never been higher...

00:20:49.829 --> 00:20:54.168
- Yes from a managerial standpoint. - Well if it's messy,
then let's double back. Let's move on to another subject.

00:20:54.169 --> 00:20:58.040
Oh, no no no, you are not taking down the
Barnett Newman and hanging that up!

00:20:58.041 --> 00:21:00.645
I'm not taking it down, I'm just replacing it
with this, let's see where I can get...

00:21:00.745 --> 00:21:02.271
Ok fine. My point is

00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:05.860
We have already awarded contracts
to the windfarm people,

00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:07.669
Don't say windfarm, I'm already feeling gassy.

00:21:07.670 --> 00:21:09.590
And to the Plastic Plantation Tree,
which was your idea by the way.

00:21:09.652 --> 00:21:12.511
- Those people are on payroll, and you won't
make a decision. - Everything was my idea,

00:21:12.542 --> 00:21:14.361
I don't care about the liberal agenda anymore.

00:21:14.362 --> 00:21:16.747
It's boring, boring!
I'm giving you a boring order,

00:21:16.748 --> 00:21:17.920
you do it.

00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:19.276
I do what?

00:21:19.277 --> 00:21:21.776
Excellent idea, I just figured this out.
You run the company.

00:21:22.188 --> 00:21:24.251
- Yeah, i'm trying to run the company.
- Pepper, I need you to run the company.

00:21:24.273 --> 00:21:28.320
- Well stop trying to do it and do it.
- You will not give me the information that I need

00:21:28.321 --> 00:21:30.706
- I need you to do it.
- I am trying to do it but...

00:21:30.707 --> 00:21:33.665
You're not listening to me. I'm trying to make you CEO.

00:21:33.701 --> 00:21:35.542
Why won't you let me?

00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:37.783
Have you been drinking?

00:21:38.434 --> 00:21:39.798
Uh, chlorophyl.

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:44.046
I hereby irrevocably appoint you

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:46.757
Chairman and CEO
of Stark Industries effective immediately.

00:21:49.653 --> 00:21:51.033
Yeah, done deal.

00:21:53.115 --> 00:21:55.640
Actually, I've given this a fair amount of thought.

00:21:55.656 --> 00:21:58.730
believe it or not. Been doing a bit of
a headhunting so to speak...

00:21:59.804 --> 00:22:02.930
trying to figure out who
a worthy successor would be.

00:22:03.643 --> 00:22:05.275
And then I realized ...

00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:10.791
it's you.
It's always been you.

00:22:12.565 --> 00:22:14.286
I thought there'd be a legal issue,
but actually

00:22:14.338 --> 00:22:16.998
I'm capable of appointing my successor,

00:22:17.847 --> 00:22:19.661
my successor being you.

00:22:22.252 --> 00:22:23.740
Congratulations!

00:22:25.289 --> 00:22:26.365
Take it, just take it.

00:22:26.367 --> 00:22:28.404
- I don't know what to think.
- Don't think, drink.

00:23:16.356 --> 00:23:19.759
Notary is here! Can you please come
sign the transfer paperworks?

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.061
I'm on Happy's count!

00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.968
- Sorry.
- What the hell was that?

00:23:28.969 --> 00:23:30.970
It's called mixed martial arts.
It's been around for three weeks.

00:23:31.054 --> 00:23:33.683
It's called dirty boxing.
There's nothing new about it.

00:23:39.030 --> 00:23:43.156
I promise you this is the only time
I will ask you to sign over your company.

00:23:45.096 --> 00:23:47.079
I need you to initial each box.

00:23:47.991 --> 00:23:50.192
Lesson one:
Never take your eye off...

00:23:52.989 --> 00:23:54.143
That's it I'm done.

00:23:54.144 --> 00:23:56.371
- What's your name, lady?
- Rushman, Natalie Rushman.

00:23:56.372 --> 00:23:58.098
Front and center, come in to the church.

00:23:58.099 --> 00:24:01.995
- No, you're seriously not gonna...
- If it pleases the Court, which it does.

00:24:01.996 --> 00:24:05.289
- No problem.
- I'm sorry. He's very eccentric.

00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.191
What?

00:24:24.185 --> 00:24:26.218
- Can you give her a lesson?
- No problem.

00:24:28.230 --> 00:24:29.304
What?

00:24:30.104 --> 00:24:31.280
Who is she?

00:24:31.281 --> 00:24:33.927
She is from legal and she is potentially

00:24:33.928 --> 00:24:37.390
a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit

00:24:37.391 --> 00:24:39.650
- if you keep ogling her like that.
- I need an assistant boxer. I need an assistant.

00:24:39.651 --> 00:24:43.274
Yes, and I have three excellent potential candidates
that are lined up and ready to beat you.

00:24:43.275 --> 00:24:47.526
- I don't have time to meet. I need someone now
I feel like it's her. - No it's not.

00:24:47.864 --> 00:24:49.329
- You ever boxed before?
- I have, yes.

00:24:49.330 --> 00:24:52.580
Like Tae Bo, booty boot camp, crunch,
something like that?

00:24:53.495 --> 00:24:57.149
- How do we spell your name Natalie?
- R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:25:00.450
- What are you gonna google her now?
- I thought I was ogling her.

00:25:01.579 --> 00:25:05.586
- Oh wow. Very, very impressive individual...
- You're so predictable, you know that?

00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:07.432
she's fluent in French,
Italian, Russian, Latin...

00:25:07.464 --> 00:25:08.683
Who speaks Latin?

00:25:08.694 --> 00:25:11.095
No one speaks Latin. It's a dead language.

00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.600
You can read Latin or you can write, but you can't
speak Latin so...

00:25:15.601 --> 00:25:17.823
- Did you model in Tokyo?
Cause she modelled in Tokyo. - No.

00:25:17.896 --> 00:25:19.273
I need her, she's got everything that I need.

00:25:19.274 --> 00:25:21.606
Rule number one: Never take your eye off
your opponent.

00:25:23.862 --> 00:25:25.620
Oh my God!

00:25:27.693 --> 00:25:30.259
- Happy!
- That's what I'm talking about.

00:25:30.269 --> 00:25:32.439
- I slipped.
- You did?

00:25:32.460 --> 00:25:34.212
Looks like a TKO to me.

00:25:37.290 --> 00:25:41.545
- Just, um, I need your impression.
- You have quite reserved, I don't know...

00:25:41.546 --> 00:25:44.186
- I meant your fingerprints.
- Right.

00:25:46.937 --> 00:25:50.145
- So, how're we doing?
- Great. Just half done,... hey.

00:25:51.676 --> 00:25:52.966
You're the boss.

00:25:53.653 --> 00:25:54.721
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

00:25:54.722 --> 00:25:55.687
- No.
- Yes.

00:25:55.688 --> 00:25:58.119
That will be all, Ms. Rushman.
Thank you very much.

00:26:01.645 --> 00:26:03.251
- I want one.
- No.

00:26:14.162 --> 00:26:16.811
Welcome to the Historic Grand Prix
of Monaco.

00:26:16.873 --> 00:26:19.940
This year's race will be exciting...

00:26:37.615 --> 00:26:41.420
It's Europe, whatever happens the next
twenty minutes just go with it.

00:26:41.421 --> 00:26:43.129
- Mr. Stark?
- Hey

00:26:43.194 --> 00:26:45.007
- How was your flight?
- It was excellent.

00:26:45.111 --> 00:26:48.421
- Oh it's nice to see you.
- We have one photographer from the ACM if you don't mind.

00:26:49.928 --> 00:26:52.082
- When did this happen?
- You made me do it.

00:26:52.083 --> 00:26:54.536
- I made you do what?
- Smile and you. Look there.

00:26:54.944 --> 00:26:56.079
Stop acting constipated.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.712
- You are so predictable.
- Do not inflate your nostrils.

00:26:57.713 --> 00:26:59.609
- Right this way.
- Thanks, you look fantastic.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:02.276
- Why thank you very much.
- But that's unprofessional. What's on the docket?

00:27:02.543 --> 00:27:04.265
We have a 9.30 dinner.

00:27:04.487 --> 00:27:07.869
- Perfect I'll be there at 11. Is this ours?
- It can be.

00:27:08.184 --> 00:27:09.504
Great, make it ours.

00:27:10.017 --> 00:27:12.563
Mr. Musk, how are you?

00:27:12.564 --> 00:27:14.462
- Congratulations on the promotion.
- Thank you very much.

00:27:14.463 --> 00:27:16.720
Elon, those Merlin engines
are fantastic.

00:27:16.721 --> 00:27:18.723
Thanks. I got an idea
for an electric jet.

00:27:18.724 --> 00:27:21.032
You do? Then we'll make it work.

00:27:22.401 --> 00:27:25.091
- You want a massage? - Oh god no I don't want a massage.
- I'll have Natalie make an appointment.

00:27:25.092 --> 00:27:27.135
I do not want Natalie to do anything.

00:27:27.136 --> 00:27:29.243
- By the way I didn't mean to spring this on you.
- Thank you very much.

00:27:29.326 --> 00:27:31.122
Green is not your best color.

00:27:31.133 --> 00:27:32.984
Anthony, is that you?

00:27:32.985 --> 00:27:35.501
My least favorite person on earth,
Justin Hammer. - How you doing?

00:27:35.797 --> 00:27:38.649
You're not the only rich guy here
with a fancy car.

00:27:38.862 --> 00:27:41.729
You know Christine Everhart
from Vanity Fair? You guys know each other?

00:27:41.730 --> 00:27:43.108
- Hi.
- Yes.

00:27:43.297 --> 00:27:44.918
- Yes!
- Yes, roughly.

00:27:45.089 --> 00:27:47.100
BTW, big story,

00:27:47.175 --> 00:27:49.499
The new CEO of Stark Industries.

00:27:49.871 --> 00:27:51.899
- Congratulations.
- My editor will kill me ...

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:53.726
... if I don't grab a quote
for our Powerful Women issue.
- Oh.

00:27:53.778 --> 00:27:55.291
- Can I?
- Sure.

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:57.442
She's actually doing a big spread on me
for Vanity Fair.

00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.738
- I am.
- I thought I'd throw her a bone, you know.

00:28:01.227 --> 00:28:04.589
She did quite a spread on
Tony last year.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:07.472
- And she wrote a story as well.
- It was very impressive.

00:28:07.473 --> 00:28:09.183
- That was good.
- Very well done.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:12.418
- I'm gonna go wash.
- Do not leave me.

00:28:12.419 --> 00:28:15.425
- How you doing? You look great.
- Please, this is hard.

00:28:16.744 --> 00:28:20.421
- So is this the first time that...
- Oh, god that's so awful.

00:28:21.329 --> 00:28:23.840
Listen, it's the first time you've seen each other
since the Senate?

00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:27.659
- Since he got his contract revoked.
- Actually, it's on hold.

00:28:27.701 --> 00:28:28.911
That's not what I heard.

00:28:28.924 --> 00:28:31.717
What's the difference between
on hold and canceled? The truth?

00:28:31.718 --> 00:28:34.159
No. The truth is, oh put that away,

00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:38.539
The truth is I'm actually hoping to
present something at your expo.

00:28:38.994 --> 00:28:41.829
Well, if you invent something that works,
I'll make sure I get you a slot.

00:28:41.915 --> 00:28:43.759
- Mr. Stark?
- Yes.

00:28:43.885 --> 00:28:45.388
- He's kidding,...
- Your corner table is ready.

00:28:45.624 --> 00:28:48.084
- I actually have a slot, yes I do.
- Hammer needs a 'slot.'

00:28:48.319 --> 00:28:52.337
- We'll give him. - We kid, we're kidders.

00:29:14.368 --> 00:29:15.917
Got any other bad ideas?

00:29:25.926 --> 00:29:28.153
Tony and I, Tony,
I love Tony Stark.

00:29:28.220 --> 00:29:30.125
Tony loves me.
We're not competitors.

00:29:30.126 --> 00:29:33.884
Him being out of the picture created tremendous
opportunity for Hammer Industries you know.

00:29:35.216 --> 00:29:37.780
Everything that Tony and I do is a healthy...

00:29:37.795 --> 00:29:40.597
<i>What's the use of having and owning
a race car,</i>

00:29:41.579 --> 00:29:42.890
...competition.

00:29:42.946 --> 00:29:44.262
<i> ...if you don't drive it?</i>

00:29:45.935 --> 00:29:47.441
Is he driving?

00:29:54.414 --> 00:29:56.037
Natalie! Natalie!

00:29:56.988 --> 00:29:58.295
- Yes?
- Did you know about this?

00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:00.085
This is the first time I hear it.

00:30:01.338 --> 00:30:03.879
- That cannot happen.
- Absolutely, I understand. How can I help you?

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.624
- Where is Happy?
- He's waiting outside.

00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:07.099
- Ok get him, I need Happy.
- Right away.

00:30:08.139 --> 00:30:10.001
Tony is, we're, you know...

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.609
We're not competitive.
You know what I mean?

00:30:12.974 --> 00:30:14.308
You know what?
Can you excuse me just one second?

00:30:14.330 --> 00:30:16.498
- Why don't you just read me what you wrote?
- I will.

00:30:16.533 --> 00:30:19.812
- After I make one quick phone call.
- Where are you going?

00:30:19.813 --> 00:30:22.438
- I got some caviar coming.
- This is great stuff, I'll be right back!

00:31:37.499 --> 00:31:40.495
<i> That asshole just goes inside the track!</i>

00:32:14.006 --> 00:32:15.958
<i> God!</i>

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.303
Go, go!

00:32:27.862 --> 00:32:28.931
Hang on!

00:33:37.841 --> 00:33:39.671
- Give me the case.
- Here, take it.

00:33:40.336 --> 00:33:41.469
- Where is the key!
- It's in my pocket.

00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:42.911
Car!

00:34:54.406 --> 00:34:56.987
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:34:57.752 --> 00:35:00.029
- Were you heading for me or him?
- I wanted to scare him.

00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:02.117
- Cause I can't tell!
- Are you out of your mind?

00:35:02.118 --> 00:35:03.625
- Better security.
- Get in the car!

00:35:03.626 --> 00:35:05.440
- I was attacked!
- You're a jerk!

00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:06.605
- We need better security.
- Get in the car!

00:35:06.606 --> 00:35:09.945
Better security measures!
God it's embarrassing.

00:35:10.966 --> 00:35:12.741
First vacation in two years.

00:35:17.821 --> 00:35:19.111
Oh  my god!

00:35:20.785 --> 00:35:23.032
- I got him!
- Hit him again, hit him again!

00:35:23.185 --> 00:35:24.989
Give me the case.

00:35:26.944 --> 00:35:30.465
- I hit him!
- Give me the case!

00:35:31.104 --> 00:35:34.158
Give him the case!

00:35:39.682 --> 00:35:40.845
Oh, god!

00:35:42.961 --> 00:35:45.850
Give me the case! Please!
Come on!

00:37:17.855 --> 00:37:19.520
You'll lose!

00:37:25.783 --> 00:37:29.058
You'll lose. You'll lose, Stark.

00:37:46.962 --> 00:37:51.298
We've checked his fingerprints. Nothing.
Not even a name.

00:37:51.348 --> 00:37:53.730
- Where are we going?
- There.

00:37:54.051 --> 00:37:56.125
He may not understand us.

00:37:56.137 --> 00:37:59.410
In fact, he has not even spoken.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.737
Five minutes.

00:38:22.087 --> 00:38:25.663
Pretty decent tech. Cycles
per second were a little low.

00:38:31.456 --> 00:38:33.247
You could double up your rotations,

00:38:37.165 --> 00:38:39.931
You focused the Repulsor energy
through ionized plasma channels.

00:38:39.981 --> 00:38:41.808
Effective.

00:38:42.037 --> 00:38:45.530
Not very efficient.
But it's passable enough though.

00:38:47.096 --> 00:38:50.691
I don't get it. With a little fine tuning
you could've made a solid paycheck,

00:38:50.692 --> 00:38:52.752
if you sold it to North Korea,
China,

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:56.333
Iran, or gone right to
the black market.

00:38:57.278 --> 00:38:59.174
You look like you got friends in low places.

00:39:00.358 --> 00:39:02.265
You come from a

00:39:02.642 --> 00:39:05.918
family of thieves and butchers.

00:39:07.232 --> 00:39:09.649
And now,
like all guilty men,

00:39:10.549 --> 00:39:12.972
try to rewrite your
own history

00:39:13.802 --> 00:39:16.468
and you forget all the lives

00:39:16.514 --> 00:39:18.763
that Stark family has destroyed.

00:39:19.853 --> 00:39:22.169
Speaking of thieves,
where did you get this design?

00:39:23.281 --> 00:39:26.567
My father.
Anton Vanko.

00:39:27.448 --> 00:39:28.820
Well I've never heard of him.

00:39:30.651 --> 00:39:33.326
My father is the reason you're alive.

00:39:33.748 --> 00:39:36.639
The reason I'm alive is cause you had a shot,
you took it and you missed.

00:39:37.429 --> 00:39:38.667
Did I?

00:39:41.441 --> 00:39:43.706
If you can make god bleed

00:39:44.570 --> 00:39:46.799
people will cease to believe him.

00:39:48.787 --> 00:39:51.391
And there will be blood in the water.

00:39:51.392 --> 00:39:53.299
and the sharks will come.

00:39:55.098 --> 00:39:58.589
The truth, all they have to do is sit and watch

00:39:59.571 --> 00:40:01.934
as the world will consume you.

00:40:02.283 --> 00:40:04.422
Where will you be watching the world
consume me from?

00:40:04.473 --> 00:40:05.777
That's right.

00:40:05.828 --> 00:40:07.937
A prison cell.
I'll send you a bar of soap.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.639
Hey Tony, before you go,

00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:14.431
palladium in the chest,
painful way to die.

00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:35.095
<i> It's just unbelievable it proves
the genie is out of the bottle</i>

00:40:35.096 --> 00:40:37.534
<i> and this man
has no idea what he's doing</i>

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:41.442
<i> He thinks of the Iron Man
weapon as a toy.</i>

00:40:41.615 --> 00:40:46.290
<i> I was at a hearing where
Mr. Stark in fact was adamant</i>

00:40:46.439 --> 00:40:49.909
<i> that these suits can't exist,</i>

00:40:49.986 --> 00:40:52.516
<i> anywhere else, don't exist anywhere else,
never will exist anywhere else</i>

00:40:52.517 --> 00:40:55.891
<i> at least for 5-10 years
and here we are in Monaco</i>

00:40:55.892 --> 00:40:58.707
<i> realizing, uh-oh, these suits exist now</i>

00:40:58.708 --> 00:41:01.835
Mute.

00:41:01.836 --> 00:41:03.922
He should be giving me a medal.

00:41:03.923 --> 00:41:06.163
That's the truth.

00:41:09.138 --> 00:41:11.223
What is that?

00:41:11.225 --> 00:41:14.508
This is your in-flight meal.

00:41:15.918 --> 00:41:18.525
- Did you just make that?
- Yeah.

00:41:18.526 --> 00:41:21.809
Where do you think I've been for three hours?

00:41:22.697 --> 00:41:24.939
Tony ...

00:41:26.244 --> 00:41:29.527
What are you not telling me?

00:41:32.503 --> 00:41:35.630
I don't want to go home ...

00:41:35.632 --> 00:41:37.717
at all.

00:41:37.718 --> 00:41:40.846
Let's cancel
my birthday party and

00:41:40.847 --> 00:41:43.245
We're in Europe.
Let's go to Venice, Chipriani.

00:41:43.350 --> 00:41:45.436
- Remember?
- Oh yes.

00:41:45.437 --> 00:41:48.043
It's a great place to...

00:41:48.044 --> 00:41:49.086
be healthy.

00:41:49.087 --> 00:41:52.216
I don't think this is the right time.

00:41:52.217 --> 00:41:54.302
We are in a kind of a mess.

00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:56.543
Yeah but maybe that's why it's the best time.

00:41:56.832 --> 00:41:58.874
Wow, I think as the CEO I need to

00:41:58.875 --> 00:42:02.168
show up. - As CEO
you are entitled to a

00:42:03.046 --> 00:42:05.168
- leave?
- Company retreat.

00:42:05.169 --> 00:42:07.218
A retreat? During a time like this?

00:42:07.219 --> 00:42:10.512
I'm just saying to recharge our batteries
and figure it all out.

00:42:10.973 --> 00:42:14.685
Not everybody runs on batteries, Tony.

00:42:47.542 --> 00:42:49.792
<i>Have fun with the Püree</i>

00:43:41.004 --> 00:43:43.631
Prisoner stop!

00:43:43.632 --> 00:43:46.172
What are you doing?

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:29.208
Hey, here he is!

00:44:29.209 --> 00:44:32.252
There he is!

00:44:32.566 --> 00:44:34.602
What an absolute pleasure.

00:44:34.604 --> 00:44:36.567
Welcome.

00:44:36.568 --> 00:44:41.255
Goodness gracious, can we get the handcuffs
off my friend here?

00:44:41.353 --> 00:44:43.353
Forgive me, I'm sorry.

00:44:43.355 --> 00:44:45.346
I'm such a huge fan of yours.

00:44:45.347 --> 00:44:47.312
I didn't wanna...

00:44:47.313 --> 00:44:48.932
make a first impression like this.

00:44:48.829 --> 00:44:51.480
He's not an animal. Come on.

00:44:51.481 --> 00:44:53.622
He's a human being.

00:44:53.623 --> 00:44:56.395
Thank you.

00:44:56.819 --> 00:44:59.002
Leave us.

00:44:59.862 --> 00:45:02.276
Oui, oui, I'm fine.

00:45:02.903 --> 00:45:04.938
My name is Justin Hammer.

00:45:04.939 --> 00:45:06.940
I'd like to do some business with you.

00:45:06.941 --> 00:45:09.028
Please sit.

00:45:11.907 --> 00:45:14.908
Dig in.
What do we have today, Jack?

00:45:14.909 --> 00:45:16.259
Some salmon carpaccio, sir.

00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:18.033
Salmon carpaccio?

00:45:19.268 --> 00:45:21.477
Anything you want here, we got it.

00:45:21.478 --> 00:45:23.478
I like my dessert first.

00:45:23.479 --> 00:45:25.412
I had this flown in from
San Francisco.

00:45:25.413 --> 00:45:27.395
It's Italian though.

00:45:27.396 --> 00:45:29.307
Organic ice cream.

00:45:29.308 --> 00:45:32.308
I got a sweet tooth.
Apparently you do too

00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:34.647
for Tony Stark.

00:45:34.727 --> 00:45:37.328
When I saw what you do to
Tony Stark on that track

00:45:37.329 --> 00:45:41.269
how you stepped up to him in front of
god and everybody,

00:45:41.478 --> 00:45:43.479
that was wow!

00:45:43.480 --> 00:45:45.515
You spoke to me was what you did.

00:45:45.517 --> 00:45:47.480
And I know that you knew that
I'd be listening.

00:45:48.003 --> 00:45:51.004
This is why I couldn't bear to have you shipped off
to god knows where.

00:45:51.005 --> 00:45:53.005
It would've been such a waste of talent.

00:45:53.006 --> 00:45:55.006
But if I might make a suggestion you know
you don't just go

00:45:55.007 --> 00:45:58.007
and try to kill the guy. I think...

00:45:58.008 --> 00:46:00.052
if I may,

00:46:00.054 --> 00:46:02.089
you go after his legacy.

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:04.054
That's what you should kill.

00:46:04.055 --> 00:46:07.099
You and me we're a lot alike in a lot of ways.

00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:10.057
The only difference between you and I

00:46:10.058 --> 00:46:12.508
is that I have resources.

00:46:12.509 --> 00:46:15.060
I think, if I may,

00:46:15.061 --> 00:46:17.075
you need my resources.

00:46:17.076 --> 00:46:19.019
Someone behind you.

00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:22.141
A benefactor.
I'd like to be that guy.

00:46:33.506 --> 00:46:35.506
Okay.
Do you speak English,

00:46:35.507 --> 00:46:38.506
because I can get a translator.

00:46:38.507 --> 00:46:40.957
I don't know if you've been understanding
everything I'm saying.

00:46:40.958 --> 00:46:43.553
- Very good, man.
- Very good, man.

00:46:43.554 --> 00:46:46.676
Very good, man.

00:46:49.557 --> 00:46:52.723
- Yes.
- I want my bird.

00:46:53.559 --> 00:46:55.559
A bird?

00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.596
- You want a bird?
- I want my bird.

00:46:57.597 --> 00:46:59.597
I can get you bird
I can get you ten birds.

00:46:59.598 --> 00:47:01.555
- I want my bird.
- Okay,

00:47:01.556 --> 00:47:03.519
nothing's impossible.

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:07.165
I could, are we talking about...
is this a bird back in Russia?

00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.644
Yes, but the fundamentals of the company
are still very, very strong.

00:47:11.481 --> 00:47:14.482
despite the events in Monaco.

00:47:14.483 --> 00:47:16.526
Oh, oh, fax them.

00:47:16.527 --> 00:47:18.564
- Where is he?
- He doesn't wanna be disturbed.

00:47:18.565 --> 00:47:21.529
He's downstairs.

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:23.530
<i>His continuing erratic behavior</i>

00:47:23.531 --> 00:47:25.887
<i>may lead many people to ask themselves</i>

00:47:25.888 --> 00:47:27.915
<i>can this man still protect us?</i>

00:47:27.994 --> 00:47:29.614
Iron Man never stopped protecting us.

00:47:29.615 --> 00:47:32.535
The events in Monaco prove that.

00:47:32.536 --> 00:47:34.535
<i>Query complete, sir.</i>

00:47:34.536 --> 00:47:37.008
<i>Anton Vanko was
a Soviet physicist</i>

00:47:37.009 --> 00:47:40.268
<i>who defected to the United States
in 1963.</i>

00:47:40.269 --> 00:47:42.540
<i> However, he was accused of espionage
and was</i>

00:47:42.541 --> 00:47:44.541
<i>deported in 1967.</i>

00:47:44.542 --> 00:47:46.542
<i>His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist,</i>

00:47:46.543 --> 00:47:50.544
<i>was convicted of selling
Soviet-era weapons-grade plutonium</i>

00:47:50.545 --> 00:47:54.502
<i>to Pakistan and served 15 years
in Kopeisk prison.</i>

00:47:54.503 --> 00:47:57.669
<i>No further records exist.</i>

00:48:00.506 --> 00:48:04.508
Tony, you gotta get upstair
and get on top of this situation right now.

00:48:04.509 --> 00:48:08.422
Listen, I've been on the phone with the
National Guard

00:48:08.423 --> 00:48:10.154
all day

00:48:10.155 --> 00:48:12.874
trying to talk them out of rolling tanks and the PCH

00:48:12.875 --> 00:48:15.382
knocking down your front door
and taking these.

00:48:15.383 --> 00:48:17.420
They're gonna take your suits, Tony,

00:48:17.421 --> 00:48:19.385
they're sick of the games.

00:48:19.386 --> 00:48:22.385
You said nobody else would possess this technology
for twenty years.

00:48:22.386 --> 00:48:25.344
Well guess what,
somebody else had it yesterday.

00:48:25.658 --> 00:48:28.554
It's not theoretical anymore.

00:48:29.391 --> 00:48:32.513
Are you listening to me?

00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:36.350
Are you okay?

00:48:36.351 --> 00:48:39.517
Let's go.

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:47.520
- Are you alright?
- Yeah I should go to my desk.

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:50.599
- See that cigar box?
- Yes.

00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.810
It's palladium.

00:48:58.649 --> 00:49:00.649
Is that supposed to be smoking?

00:49:00.650 --> 00:49:02.687
If you must know
it's neutron damage.

00:49:02.688 --> 00:49:05.774
it's from that reactor wall.

00:49:08.612 --> 00:49:11.820
You had this
in your body?

00:49:15.616 --> 00:49:18.781
And how about the high-tech
crossword puzzle on your neck?

00:49:19.618 --> 00:49:22.784
Rogue rash.

00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:26.744
Thank you.

00:49:37.715 --> 00:49:39.837
- What are you looking at?
- I'm looking at you.

00:49:40.675 --> 00:49:43.675
You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act

00:49:43.676 --> 00:49:46.677
and it's unnecessary.
You don't have to do this alone.

00:49:46.678 --> 00:49:48.693
You know I wish I could believe that.
I really do.

00:49:48.694 --> 00:49:50.635
But you gotta trust me.

00:49:50.637 --> 00:49:53.802
Contrary to popular belief,
I know exactly what I'm doing.

00:50:03.227 --> 00:50:05.680
This is where we do it
This is my humble abode.

00:50:05.681 --> 00:50:07.645
You can work in absolute peace.

00:50:07.646 --> 00:50:10.769
Must be kinda fun to be dead, right
No pressure.

00:50:11.005 --> 00:50:13.649
Ah, here they are.
They're excited, they're combat ready.

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:15.687
I may have done a few miscalculations and

00:50:15.688 --> 00:50:17.652
rushed the prototype, but sue me,

00:50:17.653 --> 00:50:20.818
I'm enthusiastic.
Go ahead, take a look around.

00:50:26.658 --> 00:50:28.658
Oh, you don't wanna do that.

00:50:28.659 --> 00:50:31.660
You'll be able to access that as soon as
we generate some encrypted passcodes.

00:50:31.661 --> 00:50:35.035
Can we generate some encrypted passcodes?
Let's get some of those...

00:50:35.662 --> 00:50:37.644
encrypted passcodes, Jack.

00:50:38.665 --> 00:50:41.787
Nevermind.

00:50:42.624 --> 00:50:45.790
Wow, okay. Good stuff.

00:50:46.981 --> 00:50:49.835
- Sorry?
- Software shit.

00:50:54.675 --> 00:50:56.674
You're good.

00:50:56.675 --> 00:50:59.799
You really blasted and
passed the firewall there.

00:51:00.635 --> 00:51:03.678
Let me show you where
you're gonna be working primarily.

00:51:03.679 --> 00:51:06.681
Go ahead, take a look.

00:51:06.682 --> 00:51:08.891
Take a good look at that.
That's something, isn't it?

00:51:08.892 --> 00:51:11.849
You know they're really just for show and tell.

00:51:12.642 --> 00:51:15.851
They're 125.7 million a pop.

00:51:18.690 --> 00:51:21.690
Jeez, could you get somebody to help?

00:51:21.691 --> 00:51:24.648
That's where the pilot goes.

00:51:24.649 --> 00:51:27.815
I'm having a tough time finding volunteers.

00:51:28.651 --> 00:51:31.817
I'll take care of that just leave it.

00:51:32.070 --> 00:51:33.653
What you want them do?

00:51:33.654 --> 00:51:35.654
Long term
I want them to put me in

00:51:35.655 --> 00:51:38.656
the Pentagon for the
next 25 years.

00:51:38.657 --> 00:51:40.738
I wanna make Iron Man look
like an antique.

00:51:40.739 --> 00:51:42.659
I wanna go to that Stark Expo

00:51:42.660 --> 00:51:44.717
and take a dump on Tony's front yard.

00:51:44.718 --> 00:51:47.263
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Ya I can do that.

00:51:47.264 --> 00:51:48.761
- Yes?
- No problem.

00:51:48.762 --> 00:51:50.707
Hey, fabulous
I love it.

00:51:50.708 --> 00:51:53.830
This is our guy. Didn't I tell you?
I had a feeling.

00:52:02.716 --> 00:52:05.715
Do you know which watch you'd like
to wear tonight Mr. Stark?

00:52:05.716 --> 00:52:08.840
I'll give them a look.

00:52:10.676 --> 00:52:12.713
I should cancel the party now?

00:52:12.714 --> 00:52:15.679
- Probably.
- Yeah, cause it's, um...

00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.680
- Ill-timed.
- Right, sends the wrong message.

00:52:18.681 --> 00:52:21.804
Inappropriate.

00:52:25.642 --> 00:52:28.686
Is that dirty enough for you?

00:52:28.687 --> 00:52:30.731
Gold faced with the brown band...

00:52:31.149 --> 00:52:33.689
The Jaeger.
I'll give that a look.

00:52:33.690 --> 00:52:36.856
Bring them over here.

00:52:37.692 --> 00:52:40.858
I'll take that.
Why don't you...

00:52:52.326 --> 00:52:54.701
I gotta say it's hard to
get a read on you.

00:52:54.702 --> 00:52:57.825
- Where are you from?
- Legal.

00:52:59.706 --> 00:53:02.827
Can I ask you a question hypothetically?
It's a bit odd.

00:53:03.709 --> 00:53:09.229
If this was your last birthday party you're ever
gonna have how would you celebrate it?

00:53:11.669 --> 00:53:14.141
I'd do whatever I wanted to do.

00:53:14.142 --> 00:53:16.879
with whoever I wanted to do it.

00:53:49.692 --> 00:53:51.691
Yes, sir, I understand.

00:53:51.692 --> 00:53:54.859
No, sir, that will not be necessary.
I'll handle it.

00:53:55.695 --> 00:53:57.861
Sir, I personally guarantee that
within 24 hours

00:53:57.885 --> 00:53:59.948
Iron Man will be
back on watch.

00:54:07.746 --> 00:54:09.746
Hey, Pepper ...

00:54:09.747 --> 00:54:12.912
- I'm gonna go get some air.
- What's wrong?

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.915
- I don't know what to do.
- You gotta be kidding me.

00:54:21.711 --> 00:54:24.712
- That's it, I'm gonna make a...
- No, no, don't call anyone.

00:54:24.713 --> 00:54:26.792
This is ridiculous I just stuck my neck up
for this guy.

00:54:26.793 --> 00:54:29.714
I know. I get it. I'm gonna handle it okay,
just let me handle it.

00:54:29.715 --> 00:54:32.881
Handle it, or I'm gonna have to.

00:54:33.717 --> 00:54:36.883
You know the question I get asked most often is
Tony how do you go to the bathroom with the suit?

00:54:40.721 --> 00:54:43.887
Just like that.

00:54:46.142 --> 00:54:48.935
Does this guy know how to throw a party
or what?

00:54:52.773 --> 00:54:54.772
I love you.

00:54:54.773 --> 00:54:59.608
Unbelievable. Thank you so much
Tony, we all thank you so much for such a

00:54:59.777 --> 00:55:02.735
wonderful night. We're gonna say
Good night now

00:55:02.736 --> 00:55:04.735
and thank you all for coming.

00:55:04.736 --> 00:55:07.945
No, no, wait, we can't, we didn't bring out the cake
we didn't blow out the candle.

00:55:07.946 --> 00:55:09.739
- You're out of control okay
- I'm out of control?

00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:11.696
- Trust me on this one okay?
- You're out of control gorgeous

00:55:11.697 --> 00:55:14.802
- It's time to go to bed.
- Give me a little smooch.

00:55:14.826 --> 00:55:16.785
Come on you know you want to.

00:55:16.787 --> 00:55:17.847
You just peed the suit.

00:55:17.848 --> 00:55:20.172
- I know, has a filtration system.
- It's not sexy.

00:55:20.173 --> 00:55:22.702
- You can drink that water.
- Just send everybody home, okay.

00:55:22.703 --> 00:55:24.784
- It's time to...
- If you say so.

00:55:24.785 --> 00:55:26.785
Okay, I'll take this.

00:55:26.786 --> 00:55:29.750
You take that.

00:55:29.751 --> 00:55:32.752
Pepper Potts.

00:55:32.754 --> 00:55:34.753
She's right.
The party is over.

00:55:34.754 --> 00:55:37.799
Then again the party was over for me
like an hour and a half ago.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.965
The after party
starts in 15 minutes!

00:55:43.803 --> 00:55:46.986
And if anybody, Pepper, doesn't like it,

00:55:47.283 --> 00:55:49.883
there's the door.

00:55:59.726 --> 00:56:02.891
Shoot!

00:56:08.774 --> 00:56:11.939
Shoot!

00:56:19.781 --> 00:56:22.990
Shoot!

00:56:25.828 --> 00:56:28.907
Me!

00:56:29.787 --> 00:56:32.909
I think she wants the Gallanger!

00:56:34.747 --> 00:56:37.912
There you go!

00:56:40.751 --> 00:56:43.916
I'm only gonna say this once.

00:56:46.666 --> 00:56:49.789
Get out!

00:56:54.627 --> 00:56:57.794
You don't deserve to wear one of these.
Shut it down!

00:56:58.630 --> 00:57:01.630
Goldstein.

00:57:01.632 --> 00:57:02.632
Yes, Mr. Stark?

00:57:02.633 --> 00:57:05.798
Give me a fat beat to beat
my buddy's ass to...

00:57:09.783 --> 00:57:12.759
I told you to shut it down.

00:57:22.600 --> 00:57:25.766
Now, put that thing back where you found it
before someone gets hurt.

00:57:32.564 --> 00:57:35.816
Really?

00:57:41.865 --> 00:57:45.344
Sorry pal, but
Iron Man doesn't have a sidekick.

00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:49.780
Suck at this!

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:58.578
Had enough?

00:57:58.579 --> 00:58:00.622
- Natalie!
- Ms. Potts ...

00:58:00.623 --> 00:58:04.518
Don't you Ms. Potts me. I'm on to you.
You know what, ever since you came here...

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:11.585
Pepper!

00:58:11.586 --> 00:58:14.752
Let's get out of here!

00:58:18.634 --> 00:58:21.843
You want it?
Take it!

00:58:44.606 --> 00:58:47.815
Out!

00:59:02.661 --> 00:59:04.660
Put your hand down.

00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:06.662
You think you got what it takes
to wear that suit?

00:59:06.663 --> 00:59:08.699
- We don't have to do this, Tony.
- You wanna be a war machine?

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:11.131
- Take your shot.
- Put it down!

00:59:11.133 --> 00:59:13.709
- You're gonna take your shot?
- Put it down, now!

00:59:13.710 --> 00:59:16.833
- Drop it Tony
- Take it!

01:00:26.148 --> 01:00:30.488
<i>Tower this is Lt. Col. James Rhodes
eastbound for 3 miles,...</i>

01:01:15.609 --> 01:01:17.338
Colonel.

01:01:18.175 --> 01:01:19.905
Major.

01:01:22.569 --> 01:01:23.689
Yeah.

01:01:25.788 --> 01:01:27.875
Let's take it inside.

01:01:27.876 --> 01:01:29.171
<i>Clear the area.</i>

01:01:51.888 --> 01:01:55.967
Sir! I'm gonna have to ask you
to exit the donut.

01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:02.231
I told you I don't wanna
join your super secret boyband.

01:02:02.807 --> 01:02:05.974
No, see, I remember, you do
everything myself.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:08.059
How's it workin out for you?

01:02:11.159 --> 01:02:14.368
I'm sorry, I don't wanna get off on the wrong
foot, do I look in the patch or the eye?

01:02:15.726 --> 01:02:18.936
Honestly I'm a bit hungover
I'm not sure if you're real or if...

01:02:19.206 --> 01:02:23.545
I am very real. I'm the realest
person you're ever gonna meet.

01:02:23.861 --> 01:02:27.331
- Just my luck. Where is the staff here?
- Oh, that's not lookin too good.

01:02:28.342 --> 01:02:30.636
It's getting worse.

01:02:31.735 --> 01:02:35.074
We've secured the perimeter, but I don't think
we should hold it for too much longer.

01:02:39.347 --> 01:02:42.469
- You're fired.
- That's not up to you.

01:02:42.740 --> 01:02:45.654
- Tony... I want you to meet agent Romanoff
- Hi

01:02:45.659 --> 01:02:49.692
I'm a Shield shadow
and I was tasked to you by Dr. Fury.

01:02:49.831 --> 01:02:51.256
I suggest you apologize.

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.388
You've been very busy.

01:02:53.572 --> 01:02:56.911
Made your girl your CEO,
you've given away all your stuff.

01:02:57.008 --> 01:02:59.168
You let your friend
fly away with your suit.

01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:01.639
- If I didn't know better...
- You don't know better.

01:03:02.328 --> 01:03:04.247
I didn't give it to him.
He took it.

01:03:04.359 --> 01:03:09.483
He took it? You're Iron Man
and he just took it?

01:03:09.667 --> 01:03:12.000
Little brother walked in there kicked your ass
and took your suit?

01:03:12.065 --> 01:03:13.659
Is that possible?

01:03:13.713 --> 01:03:16.235
According to Mr. Stark's database
security guidelines

01:03:16.236 --> 01:03:19.313
There are redundancies to prevent
unauthorized usage.

01:03:21.926 --> 01:03:24.317
- What do you want from me?
- What do we want from you? No, no, no!

01:03:24.414 --> 01:03:26.448
What do you want from me.

01:03:26.458 --> 01:03:30.461
You have become a problem, a problem
I have to deal with.

01:03:30.462 --> 01:03:33.808
- Contrary to your belief, you are not
the center of my universe. - Yeah I get it.

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:38.193
I have bigger problems than you in the Southwest
region to deal with. Hit him.

01:03:39.813 --> 01:03:42.761
Are you gonna steal my kidney and sell it?

01:03:43.249 --> 01:03:46.458
Could you please not do anything
awful for 5 seconds?

01:03:46.651 --> 01:03:47.815
What did you just do to me?

01:03:47.816 --> 01:03:50.287
What did we just do for you.

01:03:50.427 --> 01:03:54.288
That's lithium dioxide. It's gonna take the edge off.
We're trying to get you back to work.

01:03:54.450 --> 01:03:58.812
- Give me a couple of boxes and I'll be right as rain.
- It's not a cure, it's just to break the symptoms.

01:03:58.866 --> 01:04:03.598
- Then the lag is gonna be an easy fix.
- Trust me I know I'm good at this stuff.

01:04:03.912 --> 01:04:06.347
I've been looking for a suitable replacement
for palladium.

01:04:06.348 --> 01:04:10.254
I've tried every combination, every permutation of
every known element.

01:04:10.333 --> 01:04:13.820
Well, I'm here to tell you
you haven't tried them all.

01:04:15.353 --> 01:04:18.171
Hey, hey, hey.
Special delivery.

01:04:18.398 --> 01:04:19.824
Candygram!

01:04:23.662 --> 01:04:25.913
I brought you something.

01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:33.613
- We got you the bird, pal.
- This is not my bird.

01:04:34.014 --> 01:04:37.352
What do you mean?
That's the bird.

01:04:37.353 --> 01:04:39.050
I pulled a lot of strings
to get this bird.

01:04:39.104 --> 01:04:41.452
- It's a great bird.
- It's a beautiful bird.

01:04:41.453 --> 01:04:45.880
- We got this all the way from Russia.
- Hey man, it's not my bird.

01:04:47.847 --> 01:04:52.188
Well listen, even if it's not the bird,
I mean this is a gorgeous bird.

01:04:52.285 --> 01:04:56.146
I mean, look, don't get so attached to
things, learn to let go.

01:04:59.245 --> 01:05:02.018
Wait a minute.
Jack, what is that?

01:05:02.246 --> 01:05:05.456
Is that...
That's not a helmet. What is that?

01:05:13.861 --> 01:05:17.592
Ivan... What's this?
Jack?

01:05:18.384 --> 01:05:23.072
Is that a helmet? It doesn't look like a helmet
to me. How are you supposed to get a head in there?

01:05:23.169 --> 01:05:26.338
- Jack, could you put your head in there? - No.
- Try to put your head in there.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.206
Go ahead, try to put your head in there.

01:05:28.303 --> 01:05:30.860
See Ivan, he can't put his head in
there. That's...

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.544
That's not a helmet, it's a head.

01:05:33.557 --> 01:05:34.994
I need to put a guy in there.

01:05:34.995 --> 01:05:38.993
I need to fit a person
in that suit, you understand?

01:05:39.264 --> 01:05:40.386
Drone better.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:42.212
What? Drone better?
Why is drone better?

01:05:42.213 --> 01:05:44.136
Why drone better?

01:05:44.137 --> 01:05:46.060
People make problem.

01:05:46.118 --> 01:05:48.042
Trust me,
drone better.

01:05:48.444 --> 01:05:52.827
Ivan, you know I like you.
I got you the bird.

01:05:53.402 --> 01:05:58.177
You said no problem.
That's what you said to me, you said no problem.

01:05:58.274 --> 01:06:01.189
Now I need suits.
The government wants suits.

01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:03.233
Like Iron Man, you understand?

01:06:03.234 --> 01:06:06.660
That's what the people want.
That's what's gonna make them happy.

01:06:07.192 --> 01:06:08.749
Hey, man...

01:06:10.063 --> 01:06:13.176
Don't get to attached to things.

01:06:13.192 --> 01:06:15.013
Learn to let go.

01:06:18.372 --> 01:06:21.720
These drones better steal the show, Ivan.

01:06:21.721 --> 01:06:25.496
You understand? They better
rock my world, Ivan.

01:06:34.989 --> 01:06:36.850
Unbelievable.

01:06:37.077 --> 01:06:39.808
This ought to get the Senate off my ass.

01:06:39.905 --> 01:06:43.376
- It's functional?
- Fully mission-capable.

01:06:43.515 --> 01:06:46.638
Good. Get Hammer down here
to weaponize it.

01:06:47.831 --> 01:06:48.778
Sir?

01:06:48.779 --> 01:06:51.774
Justin Hammer's making a weapons presentation
at the expo.

01:06:51.804 --> 01:06:53.432
We'd like this to introduce it.

01:06:53.433 --> 01:06:54.999
Sir, I don't believe that the expo is...

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:58.035
Colonel, the world needs
to see this fast.

01:06:58.175 --> 01:06:59.827
We've got to make this happen.

01:06:59.828 --> 01:07:03.036
- Yes general, but the...
- It's also an order.

01:07:03.482 --> 01:07:04.951
Yes, sir.

01:07:05.136 --> 01:07:08.127
Good work, Colonel.
You've made your country proud.

01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:10.519
Thank you, sir.

01:07:16.663 --> 01:07:20.351
That thing in your chest is
based on unfinished technology.

01:07:20.534 --> 01:07:23.309
No it was finished,
it's never been particularly effective until

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:26.353
I've miniaturized it
and put it in my...

01:07:26.538 --> 01:07:29.775
No, Howard said that the arc reactor was
a stepping stone to something greater.

01:07:29.881 --> 01:07:31.402
He was about to kick off an energy race

01:07:31.445 --> 01:07:34.532
That was gonna dwarf
the arms race.

01:07:34.715 --> 01:07:37.933
He was on to something big,
something so big

01:07:37.934 --> 01:07:41.623
that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor
look like a AAA battery.

01:07:41.632 --> 01:07:44.067
Just him? Or was Anton Vanko in on this too?

01:07:44.068 --> 01:07:47.365
Anton Vanko is the other
side of that coin.

01:07:47.374 --> 01:07:49.650
Anton saw it as a
way to get rich.

01:07:49.651 --> 01:07:52.070
When your father found
out he had him deported.

01:07:52.071 --> 01:07:55.726
When the Russians found out he couldn't
deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia

01:07:55.727 --> 01:07:58.509
and he spent the next 20 years on a vodka
fuel rage.

01:07:58.510 --> 01:08:01.067
Not quite the environment you wanna raise
a kid in.

01:08:01.164 --> 01:08:05.242
His son you had the misfortune of
crossing paths with in Monaco.

01:08:05.644 --> 01:08:07.910
You told me I hadn't tried everything.
What do you mean I haven't tried everything?

01:08:07.939 --> 01:08:09.505
What haven't I tried?

01:08:09.507 --> 01:08:13.333
He said that you were the only person with the
means and knowledge

01:08:13.561 --> 01:08:15.683
to finish what he started.

01:08:15.693 --> 01:08:17.075
He said that?

01:08:17.302 --> 01:08:19.684
Are you that guy?
Huh? Are you?

01:08:19.999 --> 01:08:25.861
Because if you are then
you can solve the riddle of your heart.

01:08:29.570 --> 01:08:33.396
I don't know where you get your information, but
he wasn't my biggest fan.

01:08:33.397 --> 01:08:36.434
- What do your remember about your dad huh?
- He was cold, he was calculating...

01:08:36.435 --> 01:08:39.487
He never told me he loved me
he never even told me he liked me.

01:08:39.488 --> 01:08:44.097
So it's a little tough for me to digest what're you telling
me he said the whole future is riding on me

01:08:44.098 --> 01:08:46.524
and he's passing it down...
I don't get that.

01:08:46.839 --> 01:08:48.266
We're talking about a guy
whose happiest day

01:08:48.267 --> 01:08:49.831
was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

01:08:49.868 --> 01:08:50.971
That's not true.

01:08:50.972 --> 01:08:53.485
Well, then clearly you know my dad better
than I did.

01:08:53.756 --> 01:08:55.826
As a matter of fact I did.

01:08:55.947 --> 01:08:57.704
He was one of the founding members
of The Shield.

01:08:57.758 --> 01:09:00.621
- What?
- I got a two o'clock.

01:09:00.622 --> 01:09:02.455
Wait, wait, what's this?

01:09:02.456 --> 01:09:04.326
- Okay, you're good, right?
- No I'm not good.

01:09:04.327 --> 01:09:07.318
- You got this, right? - Got what? I don't
even know what I'm supposed to get.

01:09:07.372 --> 01:09:10.546
Natasha will remain
a floater at Stark with her cover intact

01:09:10.547 --> 01:09:12.577
and you remember
Agent Colson right?

01:09:12.579 --> 01:09:14.053
Yeah.

01:09:14.123 --> 01:09:15.408
Oh, and Tony...

01:09:16.463 --> 01:09:19.629
Remember, I got my eye on you.

01:09:25.642 --> 01:09:28.224
We've disabled all communications,
no contact with the outside world.

01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:30.059
Good luck.

01:09:34.473 --> 01:09:36.298
Please...

01:09:36.299 --> 01:09:39.649
First thing I need a little body work.
I'll put in a little time at the lab.

01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:44.346
If you could send of your goon squad down to the Coffee Bean
across the street or Starbucks, that'll be nice.

01:09:44.347 --> 01:09:46.993
I'm not here for that.
I've been authorized by

01:09:46.994 --> 01:09:49.783
Director Fury to use any means necessary
to keep you on premises.

01:09:49.784 --> 01:09:52.524
- If you attempt to leave - Right
- or play any games

01:09:52.525 --> 01:09:53.916
I will taze you and watch

01:09:53.917 --> 01:09:55.734
Supernanny while you
drool into the carpet. Okay?

01:09:56.178 --> 01:09:59.649
- I think I got it, yeah.
- Enjoy your evening's entertainment.

01:10:26.281 --> 01:10:28.108
Think this
is the power source?

01:10:28.109 --> 01:10:31.019
Major, this is not a scientific exercise.

01:10:31.029 --> 01:10:33.188
Let's just focus
on arming it, alright?

01:10:34.054 --> 01:10:35.808
Yes, sir.

01:10:35.809 --> 01:10:37.233
<i> Oh, yes!</i>

01:10:37.548 --> 01:10:39.495
Oh, yes, yes, yes!

01:10:39.549 --> 01:10:41.540
Is it my birthday?

01:10:41.594 --> 01:10:45.107
You gotta.. what did you do?
What did you do?

01:10:48.075 --> 01:10:50.762
- Is this what I think it is?
- Yes it is.

01:10:51.215 --> 01:10:54.381
Hammer, I want to know
what you're gonna do for us.

01:10:54.564 --> 01:10:56.611
What am I gonna do for you?

01:10:56.651 --> 01:10:59.427
First thing I'm gonna do for you is
I'm gonna upgrade your software,

01:11:02.075 --> 01:11:05.269
I'm talking about firepower.

01:11:06.675 --> 01:11:08.796
Well you're talking to the right guy.

01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:13.042
Claridge Hi-Tec semi-automatic 9 mm pistol.

01:11:14.271 --> 01:11:16.654
Too downtown?
I agree.

01:11:17.099 --> 01:11:19.568
M-24 shotgun pump action.

01:11:19.969 --> 01:11:22.614
5-round magazine, but
you know what, you're not a hunter.

01:11:22.615 --> 01:11:24.685
What am I talking about?
I'm getting rid of it.

01:11:24.702 --> 01:11:27.501
This is the FN-2000 from Belgium.

01:11:27.502 --> 01:11:29.268
They do make something better than waffles.

01:11:30.367 --> 01:11:32.765
It's beautiful, but I can tell this isn't
disco enough for you

01:11:32.766 --> 01:11:34.280
so I'm gonna put it right here.

01:11:34.281 --> 01:11:38.885
You're looking at a Milkor 40 mm grenade launcher.
Tear gas, smoke.

01:11:38.886 --> 01:11:41.263
Hippie control.
You're tough.

01:11:41.264 --> 01:11:44.195
Let me tell you something,
Size does matter.

01:11:44.196 --> 01:11:46.025
Don't let anyone tell you different.

01:11:46.188 --> 01:11:51.027
This is an M134 7.62 minigun.
Six individual barrels.

01:11:51.028 --> 01:11:53.452
The torso taker, powder maker.

01:11:53.489 --> 01:11:57.289
Our boys in uniform call it Uncle Gazpacho
or Puff the Magic Dragon.

01:12:00.582 --> 01:12:01.796
Okay.

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:07.470
These are the Cubans baby.
These are the Cohibas, the Montecristos...

01:12:08.843 --> 01:12:11.094
That's a kinetic-kill sidewinder vehicle

01:12:11.095 --> 01:12:15.314
with a secondary cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine
RDX burst.

01:12:15.935 --> 01:12:19.523
It's capable of busting a bunker under
the bunker you just busted.

01:12:19.524 --> 01:12:21.525
If it were any smarter it would write a book.

01:12:21.526 --> 01:12:24.873
A book that would make Ulysses look like
it was written in crayon.

01:12:25.396 --> 01:12:27.080
And would read it to you.

01:12:27.827 --> 01:12:31.413
This is my Eiffel Tower,
This is my Rachmaninoff's Third.

01:12:31.414 --> 01:12:35.424
My Pieta. It's completely
elegant, it's bafflingly beautiful.

01:12:35.670 --> 01:12:40.056
And it's capable of reducing the population
of any standing structure to zero.

01:12:41.386 --> 01:12:43.893
I call it the Ex-Wife.

01:12:48.479 --> 01:12:50.319
That's the best I got.

01:12:55.322 --> 01:12:58.194
How are you gonna do this? Give me something.
You're like a sphinx.

01:12:58.242 --> 01:12:59.748
I can't read you.

01:13:00.244 --> 01:13:01.495
I think I'll take it.

01:13:01.497 --> 01:13:04.129
- Which one?
- All of it.

01:13:06.085 --> 01:13:07.424
All of it?

01:13:40.339 --> 01:13:41.512
<i>Action.</i>

01:13:44.679 --> 01:13:48.537
<i>Everything is achievable through technology.</i>

01:13:48.538 --> 01:13:50.858
<i>Better living,
robust health.</i>

01:13:51.062 --> 01:13:54.487
<i>And for the first time
in human history...</i>

01:13:54.525 --> 01:13:57.242
<i>the possibility of world peace.</i>

01:13:57.446 --> 01:14:00.887
<i>I'm Howard Stark. And everything
you'll need for the future,</i>

01:14:00.888 --> 01:14:02.414
<i>can be found right here.</i>

01:14:02.619 --> 01:14:06.629
<i> City of Future, City of
of Tomorrow? Hang on.</i>

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:12.924
<i>I'm Howard Stark.</i>

01:14:12.925 --> 01:14:15.932
<i> And everything you'll need in
the future can be found right here.</i>

01:14:16.721 --> 01:14:21.440
<i> So, from all of us in
Stark Industries I would like to personally...</i>

01:14:22.604 --> 01:14:24.772
<i> Tony? What are you doing back there?
What is that?</i>

01:14:24.773 --> 01:14:27.740
<i>Put it back.
Put it back where you got it from.</i>

01:14:28.779 --> 01:14:30.702
<i>Where is your mother?
Maria...</i>

01:14:31.240 --> 01:14:33.540
<i>Go on, go, go, go...</i>

01:14:35.455 --> 01:14:37.336
<i>Sorry I think we got the...</i>

01:14:38.083 --> 01:14:40.424
<i>I'll come in in there...</i>

01:14:44.132 --> 01:14:45.910
<i>Are you waiting on me?</i>

01:14:47.554 --> 01:14:51.730
<i>So from all of us in
Stark Industries I'd like to personally show you...</i>

01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:54.145
<i> my ass.</i>

01:14:54.146 --> 01:14:58.739
<i>I'd like to... This...
I can't... We have this don't we?</i>

01:14:58.819 --> 01:15:01.285
<i>That looks ridiculous.</i>

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.579
<i>Everything...</i>

01:15:04.743 --> 01:15:06.500
<i>is achievable...</i>

01:15:07.164 --> 01:15:08.420
<i>through technology.</i>

01:15:21.266 --> 01:15:22.767
<i>Tony...</i>

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:27.027
<i>You're too young to understand this right now
so I thought I would put it on film for you.</i>

01:15:29.318 --> 01:15:31.408
<i> I built this for you.</i>

01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:36.874
<i> And someday you'll realize that it represents
a whole lot more than just people's inventions.</i>

01:15:37.329 --> 01:15:39.377
<i>It represents my life's work.</i>

01:15:40.082 --> 01:15:42.340
<i>This is key to the future.</i>

01:15:45.464 --> 01:15:48.055
<i>I'm limited by the technology
of my time.</i>

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:50.559
<i> But one day you'll figure this out.</i>

01:15:50.888 --> 01:15:55.398
<i>And when you do...
you will change the world.</i>

01:15:57.147 --> 01:16:01.448
<i> What is and always will be
my greatest creation...</i>

01:16:03.447 --> 01:16:05.120
<i>is you.</i>

01:16:24.767 --> 01:16:26.184
Hi, sir.

01:16:26.185 --> 01:16:29.000
- $6.
- I don't have any...

01:16:29.001 --> 01:16:31.822
- No sir, that's too much.
- No it's fine, take that.

01:16:34.488 --> 01:16:36.015
Take it, take it.

01:16:36.261 --> 01:16:39.144
I don't like people hand me things so if you
could just drop that there that would be great.

01:16:39.453 --> 01:16:41.793
- Are you Iron Man?
- Sometimes.

01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:43.671
We believe in you!

01:16:44.167 --> 01:16:46.967
It was an illegal seizure
of trademarked property.

01:16:47.005 --> 01:16:49.590
- Ms. Potts, Mr Stark is...
- Here.

01:16:49.591 --> 01:16:52.850
- He refuses to...
- I don't. It's fine. I'll just be a second.

01:16:53.222 --> 01:16:59.025
It's our position that Stark has the means to maintain
proprietary ownership of the Mark II platform.

01:16:59.438 --> 01:17:02.316
<i>When Mr. Stark announced he was the Iron Man</i>

01:17:02.317 --> 01:17:06.530
<i>he was making a promise to America.</i>

01:17:06.531 --> 01:17:08.538
<i>Obviously he did not.</i>

01:17:08.784 --> 01:17:10.811
<i>Now we learn that his secretary,</i>

01:17:10.870 --> 01:17:13.419
<i>a woman named
Virginia "Pepper" Potts,</i>

01:17:13.499 --> 01:17:15.834
<i>has been appointed CEO
of Stark Industries executive.</i>

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:18.128
<i>What are her qualifications?</i>

01:17:18.129 --> 01:17:18.754
No.

01:17:18.755 --> 01:17:21.221
- Ms. Potts is doing nothing to manage the terrible
situation... - Mute.

01:17:22.677 --> 01:17:27.433
Bert, don't tell me that we have the
best patent lawyers in the country

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:29.232
and then not let me pursue this.

01:17:29.853 --> 01:17:30.937
I'll get this stuff out of here.

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:33.070
Well then, tell the President
to sign an order.

01:17:34.401 --> 01:17:36.690
We'll talk about it at the expo.

01:17:36.696 --> 01:17:38.911
Hammer's giving some presentation
tomorrow evening.

01:17:39.199 --> 01:17:42.703
- Will Tony Stark be there?
- Will I?

01:17:42.704 --> 01:17:44.711
- No, he will not.
- I'd like to be.

01:17:46.208 --> 01:17:47.500
- Got a minute?
- No.

01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:49.634
Come on, you just got off the phone.
30 seconds.

01:17:52.425 --> 01:17:54.723
29 ... 28 ...

01:17:54.928 --> 01:17:59.313
I was driving over here, and I thought
I was coming basically to apologize, but I'm not.

01:17:59.392 --> 01:18:03.361
- You didn't come here to apologize?
- That goes without saying, and I'm working on that.

01:18:03.607 --> 01:18:07.360
But I haven't been entirely up front
with you

01:18:07.361 --> 01:18:09.030
and I just wanna try to make good,

01:18:09.031 --> 01:18:12.492
Can I move this?
This is crazy I got ferris wheel...

01:18:12.493 --> 01:18:13.707
No.

01:18:16.624 --> 01:18:18.464
Do you know how short life is?

01:18:19.044 --> 01:18:22.046
And if I never got to express...

01:18:22.047 --> 01:18:24.926
and by the way somewhat revelatory to me,

01:18:24.927 --> 01:18:27.742
I don't care... I mean, I care, it would be nice,

01:18:27.743 --> 01:18:30.605
I'm not expecting you to...
Look, here's what I'm trying to say.

01:18:31.018 --> 01:18:33.938
Let me just stop you right here, okay,
because if you say "I"

01:18:33.939 --> 01:18:37.323
one more time, I'm gonna actually hurl
something at your head, I think.

01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:42.115
I am trying to run a company.
Do you know have any idea what that entails?

01:18:42.116 --> 01:18:42.996
Yes.

01:18:43.075 --> 01:18:46.037
People are relying on you to be
Iron Man, and you've disappeared.

01:18:46.038 --> 01:18:49.421
All I'm doing is putting out your fire
and taking the heat for it.

01:18:52.005 --> 01:18:55.722
I am trying to do the job that you
were meant to do.

01:18:59.223 --> 01:19:01.146
Did you bring me strawberries?

01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:06.726
Did you know that there is only one thing
on earth that I am allergic to?

01:19:06.727 --> 01:19:07.900
You're allergic to strawberries, uh-uh.

01:19:10.821 --> 01:19:14.539
This is progress, Pepper. I knew there
was correlation between you and this...

01:19:15.661 --> 01:19:17.834
- I need you...
- And I need you too, that's what I'm trying to say.

01:19:17.913 --> 01:19:20.422
to leave now.

01:19:25.006 --> 01:19:26.179
Ms Potts.

01:19:26.926 --> 01:19:30.393
- Hi, come on in.
- Wheel's up in 25 minutes.

01:19:30.764 --> 01:19:32.333
Thank you.

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:35.103
Anything else, boss?

01:19:35.104 --> 01:19:38.737
- I'm good Hap.
- I'll be just... another minute.

01:19:39.734 --> 01:19:41.658
I lost both the kids in the divorce.

01:19:45.575 --> 01:19:46.768
No.

01:19:48.914 --> 01:19:51.713
Are you blending in well here, Natalie?

01:19:51.959 --> 01:19:54.425
Here at Stark... Enterprises.

01:19:55.047 --> 01:19:56.720
Your name is Natalie, isn't it?

01:19:57.425 --> 01:20:00.761
I thought you two
didn't get along.

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:03.187
- No, that's not so.
- It's just me you don't care for.

01:20:03.933 --> 01:20:05.059
No? Nothing?

01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:09.351
Actually while you're here maybe you and Natalie
could discuss the matter of personal belonging.

01:20:09.352 --> 01:20:10.530
Absolutely.

01:20:17.493 --> 01:20:21.747
- I'm surprised you could keep your mouth shut.
- You're good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous.

01:20:21.748 --> 01:20:22.593
How do you do it?

01:20:22.594 --> 01:20:25.362
You're a triple impostor.
I've never seen anything like it.

01:20:25.410 --> 01:20:27.448
Is there anything real about you?
Do you even speak Latin?

01:20:27.449 --> 01:20:29.634
Fallaces sunt rerum species.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.585
Which means?
What did you just say?

01:20:32.586 --> 01:20:35.385
It means you can either drive yourself home
or I can have you collected.

01:20:37.510 --> 01:20:38.974
You're good!

01:21:38.632 --> 01:21:41.599
Jarvis, could you kindly
backform a digital wireframe?

01:21:41.657 --> 01:21:43.268
I need a manipulable projection.

01:21:51.524 --> 01:21:54.825
1974 Stark Expo model scanning
complete, sir.

01:21:56.865 --> 01:22:01.417
- How many buildings are there?
- Am I to include the Belgian waffles stand?

01:22:01.622 --> 01:22:03.628
It was rhetorical, just show me.

01:22:16.475 --> 01:22:18.523
What does that look like to you, Jarvis?

01:22:19.311 --> 01:22:21.152
Not unlike an atom.

01:22:21.398 --> 01:22:25.324
In which case, the nucleus... would be here.

01:22:26.195 --> 01:22:27.701
Highlight the Unisphere.

01:22:36.606 --> 01:22:41.887
- Notice the footpaths. Get rid of them.
- What is it you're trying to achieve, sir?

01:22:42.259 --> 01:22:45.517
I'm discovering,... correction, rediscovering...

01:22:46.556 --> 01:22:47.853
... a new element.

01:22:49.017 --> 01:22:52.313
Lose the landscape and the shrubbery there,
trees,

01:22:52.314 --> 01:22:54.279
parking lots, exits, entrances.

01:22:58.697 --> 01:23:01.288
Structre protons and neutrons

01:23:01.451 --> 01:23:05.127
using flags the pavillions as the framework.

01:23:30.072 --> 01:23:32.413
Dead for almost 20 years...

01:23:33.869 --> 01:23:35.917
...still taking me to school.

01:23:41.254 --> 01:23:45.973
The proposed element should serve
as a viable replacement for palladium.

01:23:46.469 --> 01:23:47.636
Thanks, Dad.

01:23:47.638 --> 01:23:50.604
Unfortunately,
it is impossible to synthesize.

01:23:54.814 --> 01:23:58.698
Get ready for major remodel, fellas!
We're back in hardware mode.

01:24:46.299 --> 01:24:48.734
How did you break the perimeter?

01:24:48.803 --> 01:24:50.924
That was like three years ago.
Where have you been?

01:24:50.925 --> 01:24:54.146
- I was doing some stuff.
- Yeah, well, me too and it worked.

01:24:55.645 --> 01:24:59.857
Hey, I'm playing for the home team, Colson
You and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.

01:24:59.858 --> 01:25:01.781
Let me work, or break my balls?

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:04.703
What's this doing here?

01:25:07.493 --> 01:25:08.791
That's it.

01:25:09.330 --> 01:25:10.836
Bring it to me.

01:25:11.165 --> 01:25:13.589
- You know what this is?
- It's exactly what I need to make this work.

01:25:15.358 --> 01:25:16.719
Lift the coil.

01:25:16.631 --> 01:25:19.681
Go, go! Put your knees under it.
There you go.

01:25:19.718 --> 01:25:21.141
And...

01:25:21.888 --> 01:25:23.812
- Drop it. - Okay.

01:25:27.145 --> 01:25:28.234
Perfectly level.

01:25:29.105 --> 01:25:31.155
- I'm busy. What do you want?
- Nothing.

01:25:31.192 --> 01:25:33.866
Good bye. I've been reassigned.

01:25:33.987 --> 01:25:35.571
Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

01:25:35.572 --> 01:25:38.373
- Fantastic, the land of enchantment.
- So I'm told.

01:25:38.410 --> 01:25:40.166
- Secret stuff.
- Something like that.

01:25:41.622 --> 01:25:42.753
- Good luck.
- Bye.

01:25:43.249 --> 01:25:44.918
- Thanks.
- We need you.

01:25:44.919 --> 01:25:47.635
- Yeah, more than you know.
- Not that much.

01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:08.371
<i>Initializing
prismatic accelerator.</i>

01:26:14.833 --> 01:26:17.382
<i>Approaching maximum power.</i>

01:27:04.733 --> 01:27:06.114
That was easy.

01:27:22.486 --> 01:27:24.389
<i>Congratulations, sir.</i>

01:27:26.095 --> 01:27:28.435
<i>You have created a new element.</i>

01:27:36.505 --> 01:27:40.034
<i>Sir, the reactor has accepted the
modified core.</i>

01:27:40.697 --> 01:27:42.829
<i>I will begin running diagnostics.</i>

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:50.590
Hey, Ivan.

01:27:51.045 --> 01:27:55.216
<i>I got Senator Stern here. Thought we'd swing over
and look at some of the drone designs.</i>

01:27:54.904 --> 01:27:58.768
- The drone is not going to be ready.
- Not ready... What do you mean?

01:27:59.306 --> 01:28:02.355
It can make presentation
not demonstration.

01:28:02.435 --> 01:28:07.404
- What the hell is the difference?
- Presentation, no fly, no shoot.

01:28:07.483 --> 01:28:10.658
Wait. What can we make 'em do, I mean,

01:28:10.716 --> 01:28:12.536
This is a weapons demonstration.

01:28:12.657 --> 01:28:14.288
I can make salute.

01:28:14.785 --> 01:28:17.375
You can make salute, what do you mean
make salute?

01:28:17.538 --> 01:28:19.462
What the hell does that mean, Ivan?

01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:22.132
<i>It's not what we agreed to, okay.</i>

01:28:22.149 --> 01:28:24.791
<i>You promised me suits, and then you promised
me drones.</i>

01:28:24.792 --> 01:28:28.682
- Hey man, everything will be okay.
- This is not what I wanted.

01:28:40.736 --> 01:28:43.494
Hey, there he is, the bird man.

01:28:45.659 --> 01:28:47.583
Oh, now you like the bird, is that right?

01:28:47.745 --> 01:28:50.920
Is that your bird?
I'm confused.

01:28:51.542 --> 01:28:54.926
You said it wasn't, but now
it's like you're best of pals.

01:28:55.130 --> 01:28:56.594
You love that bird, don't you?

01:28:57.341 --> 01:28:59.014
You know what? Take the bird.

01:29:04.184 --> 01:29:06.691
Take his pillows too. Both of them.

01:29:07.605 --> 01:29:09.445
And shoes, take his shoes.

01:29:13.821 --> 01:29:15.370
I took your stuff.

01:29:15.824 --> 01:29:18.957
How does that make you feel?
You feel bad?

01:29:19.496 --> 01:29:22.463
Good. Cause that's how I feel!

01:29:24.169 --> 01:29:26.175
We had a contract!

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:31.433
I saved your life
and you give me suits.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:35.397
That was our deal.
And you did not deliver.

01:29:36.394 --> 01:29:39.318
I don't know if you're a genius
or a fraud.

01:29:39.324 --> 01:29:41.237
I don't know what you are!

01:29:43.236 --> 01:29:46.452
Something really, really great fell into my lap.

01:29:47.324 --> 01:29:50.458
If it hadn't, I'd be at your mercy tonight.

01:29:50.663 --> 01:29:54.708
Now I have a piece of Stark tech, and I pimped
out myself.

01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:59.131
Now your overpriced paperweights are gonna
look like a backdrop to my demonstration.

01:29:59.132 --> 01:30:01.514
You dig what I'm gettin' at here?

01:30:03.972 --> 01:30:08.315
I don't know if you noticed,
but I don't speak Russian!

01:30:11.774 --> 01:30:16.951
I'm gonna leave now. I'm gonna go to the expo.
Maybe I'll even get laid.

01:30:17.740 --> 01:30:21.708
See these guys? They're your babysitters.
They are not to be trifled with.

01:30:22.705 --> 01:30:26.172
When I get back, we're gonna renegotiate the
terms of our agreement.

01:30:27.378 --> 01:30:29.838
And you're gonna make good on our arrangements.

01:30:29.839 --> 01:30:32.514
Because if you don't, you're gonna be exactly what you were
when I found you,

01:30:32.552 --> 01:30:34.975
a dead man.

01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:36.769
You got that?

01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:40.024
Maybe you can watch me on TV.

01:30:49.219 --> 01:30:51.664
Dummy. You.
Can we clean up this mess?

01:30:52.328 --> 01:30:56.500
- Incoming call with a blocked number, sir.
- Phone privileges reinstated.

01:30:56.510 --> 01:30:58.173
Lovely.

01:30:58.419 --> 01:31:03.096
- Colson, how's land of enchantment?
- Hey, Tony, how you doin'?

01:31:04.302 --> 01:31:05.933
- I doubled cycle. - You what?

01:31:07.056 --> 01:31:11.477
You told me double cycle's
more power. Good advice.

01:31:11.478 --> 01:31:15.112
- You sound pretty spitely for a dead guy.
- You too.

01:31:17.361 --> 01:31:18.403
- Trace it. - Sir.

01:31:18.404 --> 01:31:22.914
Now the true history of
Stark name will be written.

01:31:22.952 --> 01:31:25.960
- Jarvis, where he is?
- Accessing the Oracle grid.

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:28.046
Eastern seaboard.

01:31:28.167 --> 01:31:32.218
What your father did to my family
over 40 years

01:31:32.965 --> 01:31:35.426
I will do to you in 40 minutes.

01:31:35.427 --> 01:31:37.887
Sounds good, let's get together
and hash it out.

01:31:37.888 --> 01:31:41.606
Tri-state area.
Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

01:31:41.811 --> 01:31:43.609
I hope you're ready.

01:31:46.483 --> 01:31:48.324
<i>Call trace incomplete.</i>

01:31:59.041 --> 01:32:01.674
- Sir.
- You wanna run some tests, run 'em.

01:32:03.131 --> 01:32:04.923
And assemble the suit while you're at it
put it together now.

01:32:04.924 --> 01:32:07.390
- We are unclear as to the effects...
- I don't wanna hear it, Jarvis!

01:32:11.558 --> 01:32:14.900
It tastes like coconut...
and metal.

01:32:29.519 --> 01:32:33.091
I'll keep the car down here, alright.
- Thank you Happy.

01:32:33.108 --> 01:32:38.682
<i>Justin Hammer, his presentation will begin shortly
in the main pavilion.</i>

01:32:58.705 --> 01:33:01.754
That's what I'm talking about!
Thanks for coming.

01:33:02.918 --> 01:33:05.968
Ladies and gentlemen,
for far too long

01:33:06.465 --> 01:33:09.598
this country has had to place its brave men
and women in harm's way.

01:33:09.886 --> 01:33:12.122
But then the Iron Man arrived
and we thought that

01:33:12.181 --> 01:33:14.730
the days of losing lives were behind us.

01:33:15.935 --> 01:33:18.359
Sadly that technology was kept out of reach.

01:33:18.438 --> 01:33:20.863
That's not fair. That's not right.

01:33:21.193 --> 01:33:23.528
- And it's just too bad.
- Oh, lord...

01:33:23.529 --> 01:33:28.498
Regardless it was an impressive innovation
one that grabbed headlines the world over.

01:33:28.953 --> 01:33:34.131
Today, my friends, the press
is faced with quite a different problem.

01:33:34.752 --> 01:33:38.052
They are about to run out of ink.

01:33:42.888 --> 01:33:44.227
Get that out of here.

01:33:45.725 --> 01:33:47.524
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:33:48.521 --> 01:33:50.611
...today I present to you

01:33:51.107 --> 01:33:54.575
...the new face of the United States military!

01:33:55.614 --> 01:33:57.328
The Hammer drone!

01:33:59.598 --> 01:34:01.709
Army!

01:34:13.825 --> 01:34:18.732
Navy!

01:34:25.299 --> 01:34:28.035
Air Force!

01:34:34.394 --> 01:34:37.257
Marines!

01:34:53.795 --> 01:34:57.179
That's a hell of a lot better than some
cheerleaders, let me tell you.

01:34:58.447 --> 01:35:01.163
But as revolutionary
as this technology is,

01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:05.044
there will always be a need for a man
to be present at the theater of war.

01:35:05.457 --> 01:35:10.581
Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud
to present to you the very first prototype

01:35:10.582 --> 01:35:14.447
the variable threat response battle suit

01:35:14.458 --> 01:35:17.726
and its pilot Air Force Lt. Col. James Rhodes.

01:35:18.672 --> 01:35:20.287
What?

01:35:41.098 --> 01:35:44.276
For America and its allies,
Hammer Industries, is reporting...

01:36:01.855 --> 01:36:03.856
We got trouble.

01:36:03.857 --> 01:36:05.858
Tony, there are civilians present.

01:36:05.859 --> 01:36:08.399
I'm here on orders.
Let's not do this right now.

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.000
Give them a wave.

01:36:11.513 --> 01:36:13.801
All these people are in danger.
We gotta get them out of here.

01:36:13.802 --> 01:36:16.055
You gotta trust
me for the next five minutes.

01:36:16.056 --> 01:36:18.057
I tried that and
I got tossed around your house, remember?

01:36:18.058 --> 01:36:20.524
I think he's working with Vanko.

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:23.704
Vanko is alive?

01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:26.818
- Where is he?
- What?

01:36:26.819 --> 01:36:28.535
Where is Vanko?

01:36:28.536 --> 01:36:30.824
- Who?
- Tell me.

01:36:30.825 --> 01:36:33.717
What are you doing here, man?

01:36:38.236 --> 01:36:41.551
- Is that you?
- No, I'm not doing that, it's not me.

01:36:41.553 --> 01:36:44.732
I can't move.
I'm locked up, I'm locked up.

01:36:45.141 --> 01:36:48.561
Get out of here! Go!
The whole system's been compromised!

01:36:48.562 --> 01:36:51.700
Let's take it outside.

01:37:02.539 --> 01:37:05.719
No!

01:37:13.762 --> 01:37:16.733
- Jarvis, break in, I need to own him.
- Yes, sir.

01:37:19.562 --> 01:37:22.252
Tony, I'm locked on I have target locked.

01:37:22.253 --> 01:37:25.745
- On what?
- On you.

01:37:29.095 --> 01:37:31.514
Tony on your six.

01:37:47.558 --> 01:37:50.560
- What's going on, what's happening?
- The software's been overwritten.

01:37:50.561 --> 01:37:52.564
What?
What do you mean it's been overwritten?

01:37:52.565 --> 01:37:55.103
- I think he slaved the drones.
- It is impossible.

01:37:55.104 --> 01:37:56.568
- Call the guards
- All the phones are down, sir.

01:37:56.569 --> 01:37:59.573
- Then call their cells.
- Their cell phones are not working either, sir.

01:37:59.574 --> 01:38:02.576
- He's locked us out of the mainframe.
- Who's locked you out of the mainframe?

01:38:02.577 --> 01:38:05.116
Please, please, go away.
I got this handled.

01:38:05.117 --> 01:38:06.582
- Have you now?
- Yes I do.

01:38:06.583 --> 01:38:08.585
In fact, if your guy hadn't showed up

01:38:08.586 --> 01:38:11.124
This wouldn't be happening
Please now, go away!

01:38:11.125 --> 01:38:12.589
Thank you.

01:38:12.590 --> 01:38:15.552
Listen we gotta get these bitches outta here.

01:38:15.553 --> 01:38:17.779
You're gonna tell me who's behind
this.

01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.557
Who's behind this?

01:38:19.558 --> 01:38:22.144
Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

01:38:22.563 --> 01:38:25.216
- Where is he?
- He's at my facility.

01:38:28.612 --> 01:38:32.006
- I need NYPD please.
- No, no, no honey.

01:38:32.054 --> 01:38:33.205
Don't call the authorities!

01:38:33.326 --> 01:38:36.001
Step aside.

01:38:36.581 --> 01:38:38.171
Tell me everything you know. Go.

01:38:45.551 --> 01:38:49.144
- How we doing Jarvis?
- Remote reboot unsuccessful.

01:39:08.415 --> 01:39:12.586
- No one's answering the phone, what's going on?
- Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.

01:39:12.587 --> 01:39:13.963
I'm not taking you anywhere.

01:39:13.964 --> 01:39:17.306
- Fine. You want me to drive?
- No, I'm driving. Get in the car.

01:40:16.214 --> 01:40:17.803
Nice work, kid.

01:40:19.552 --> 01:40:22.935
- You got multiples coming down on you.
- Let's get this away from the expo.

01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:30.914
When we arrive I need you to watch the perimeter.

01:40:30.983 --> 01:40:33.198
I'm gonna enter the facility and take down the target.

01:40:36.783 --> 01:40:38.330
- Watch the road.
- I got it.

01:41:09.952 --> 01:41:12.955
Listen, listen, a pack has peeled off and headed
back to the expo.

01:41:12.956 --> 01:41:14.128
Got it.

01:41:18.255 --> 01:41:22.306
I'm closing on you!
It's coming in hot, Tony! Watch it.

01:41:37.697 --> 01:41:40.580
- Stay in the car!
- I'm not staying in the car.

01:41:40.868 --> 01:41:43.585
- I said stay in the car.
- What are you wearing?

01:41:46.125 --> 01:41:47.631
Look, I'm not letting you go in there alone.

01:41:48.211 --> 01:41:50.802
- You wanna help? Keep the car running.
- Okay.

01:41:54.636 --> 01:41:56.768
Hey, you can't come in here!

01:42:43.117 --> 01:42:46.371
Each set of drones
is communicating in its own unique language.

01:42:46.372 --> 01:42:50.340
- Choose one and focus on that.
- Have you tried Russian? Why don't you try Russian.

01:43:40.110 --> 01:43:41.491
I got 'em!

01:43:56.214 --> 01:43:57.888
- Rhodey, you're still locked on? - Yeah.

01:43:58.134 --> 01:44:02.143
Drop your socks and grab your
crocs, we're about to get wet on this ride.

01:44:03.976 --> 01:44:05.648
Wait, wait!

01:44:24.420 --> 01:44:25.925
He's gone!

01:44:30.594 --> 01:44:33.060
Sorry buddy, had
to thin out the herd.

01:44:33.202 --> 01:44:34.833
What's your twenty?

01:44:46.657 --> 01:44:49.582
- What are you doing?
- I'm rebooting Rhodey's suit.

01:44:56.128 --> 01:44:57.217
Tony!

01:45:13.610 --> 01:45:14.907
Reboot complete.

01:45:15.779 --> 01:45:19.366
- You got your best friend back.
- Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.

01:45:19.367 --> 01:45:24.795
Well done with the new chest-piece. I'm reading significantly
higher output and your vitals all look promising.

01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:26.839
Yes, for the moment I'm not dying. Thank you.

01:45:27.837 --> 01:45:30.271
- What do you mean you're not dying? Did you say you're dying?
- That you?

01:45:30.340 --> 01:45:32.138
No, I'm not. Not anymore.

01:45:32.343 --> 01:45:34.553
- What's going on?
- I was going to tell you. I didn't want to..

01:45:34.555 --> 01:45:37.640
- You're gonna tell me you really were dying?
- You didn't let me.

01:45:37.642 --> 01:45:41.438
- Why didn't you tell me that?
- I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you!

01:45:41.439 --> 01:45:44.879
Hey, hey, save it for the honeymoon.
You got incoming, Tony.

01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:46.360
Looks like the fight's coming to you.

01:45:46.361 --> 01:45:48.112
- Great. Pepper?
- Are you okay now?

01:45:48.113 --> 01:45:50.992
- I'm fine. Don't be mad. I will formally...
- I am mad.

01:45:50.993 --> 01:45:53.875
...apologize when I'm not fending off a Hammeroid attack!

01:45:54.789 --> 01:45:56.922
- We could've been in Venice.
- Oh, please...

01:45:59.379 --> 01:46:00.718
Rhodes!

01:46:01.381 --> 01:46:03.097
Snap out of it, buddy!
I need you.

01:46:04.928 --> 01:46:06.476
They're coming. Come on let's roll. Get up.

01:46:10.436 --> 01:46:12.400
Oh man, you can have your suit back.

01:46:16.025 --> 01:46:18.659
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

01:46:20.824 --> 01:46:23.848
- Tony, look... I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

01:46:23.849 --> 01:46:26.127
- No I should've trusted you more.
- I'm the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

01:46:26.582 --> 01:46:28.604
No it's your fault. I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

01:46:28.605 --> 01:46:31.593
Thank you.
That's all I want to hear, partner.

01:46:32.173 --> 01:46:35.472
They're coming in hot. Any
second. What's the play?

01:46:36.511 --> 01:46:39.118
Well we wanna take the high ground, okay.
So let's take

01:46:39.119 --> 01:46:42.247
the biggest gun up on that ridge. - Got you.

01:46:42.248 --> 01:46:44.355
- Where do you wanna be?
- Where you going? - What are you talking about?

01:46:44.356 --> 01:46:46.733
- I mean me.
- I have a big gun, you are not the big gun.

01:46:46.734 --> 01:46:49.189
- Tony, don't be jealous.
- No it's subtle with all the bells and whistles.

01:46:49.190 --> 01:46:51.661
- It's called being a bad ass.
- Fine.

01:46:52.909 --> 01:46:56.845
- Alright. You go up top. I'll draw 'em in.
- But don't stay down here

01:46:56.872 --> 01:46:58.535
it's the worst place to be.

01:46:58.541 --> 01:47:02.696
- Okay you got a spot. Where's mine?
- It's the kill box, Tony, okay, this is where you go to die.

01:47:52.487 --> 01:47:54.077
- See that?
- Yea, yea, nice.

01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:02.798
Rhodey...

01:48:04.420 --> 01:48:05.467
Get down!

01:48:16.437 --> 01:48:18.938
Wow. I think you should lead with that
next time.

01:48:18.940 --> 01:48:22.741
Yeah, sorry boss, I can only use it once.
It's a one-off.

01:48:24.697 --> 01:48:26.495
I told you that five minutes ago.

01:48:28.118 --> 01:48:29.708
That's your guy here.

01:48:30.914 --> 01:48:32.587
- Excuse me?
- Sir, you're placed under arrest.

01:48:32.875 --> 01:48:34.417
Hands behind your back, sir.

01:48:34.418 --> 01:48:35.799
I'm trying to help here.

01:48:40.176 --> 01:48:43.769
I get it. I see what you're doing. Trying
to pin this on me, huh?

01:48:44.015 --> 01:48:48.347
That's good. You start to think like a CEO.
Taking out the competition.

01:48:48.348 --> 01:48:51.628
I like that.
You think you're making a problem for me?

01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:54.825
I'm gonna make a problem for you.
I'm gonna be seeing you again, real soon.

01:48:59.702 --> 01:49:03.628
When they get here, I think you should station them
at the Southeast and both West exits.

01:49:04.166 --> 01:49:06.001
We shut down the seven train in and out of
Willets Point already.

01:49:06.002 --> 01:49:09.135
Well, have city buses there to ferry people
to operating lines.

01:49:09.548 --> 01:49:10.966
You coming with us?

01:49:10.967 --> 01:49:12.891
No, I'm gonna stay until the park is clear.

01:49:15.932 --> 01:49:20.171
Heads up you got one more drone incoming.
This one looks different.

01:49:20.522 --> 01:49:22.820
Repulsor signature
is significantly higher.

01:49:33.748 --> 01:49:35.337
Good to be back.

01:49:36.334 --> 01:49:37.715
This ain't gonna be good.

01:49:41.091 --> 01:49:45.308
I got something special for this guy.
I'm gonna bust his bunker with the ex-wife.

01:49:45.471 --> 01:49:46.603
The what?

01:49:57.487 --> 01:49:59.786
- Hammer tech?
- Yeah.

01:50:01.660 --> 01:50:02.832
We got this.

01:50:56.065 --> 01:50:57.906
Rhodes! I got an idea.

01:50:58.830 --> 01:51:00.654
You wanna be a hero?

01:51:00.655 --> 01:51:03.408
- What?
- I can really use a sidekick.

01:51:03.409 --> 01:51:06.323
- Put your hand up.
- This is your idea?

01:51:06.324 --> 01:51:09.879
- Yup.
- I'm ready, I'm ready, go go go.

01:51:13.672 --> 01:51:15.303
Hit him!

01:51:43.003 --> 01:51:44.884
You lose.

01:51:52.119 --> 01:51:54.877
All these drones are rigged to blow
We gotta get out of here man.

01:51:55.248 --> 01:51:56.796
Pepper?

01:52:36.470 --> 01:52:38.513
Oh my god, I can't take this anymore!

01:52:38.514 --> 01:52:39.681
- You can't?
- I can't take this.

01:52:39.682 --> 01:52:41.037
What do you mean, look at me!

01:52:41.038 --> 01:52:45.183
My body literally cannot handle the stress.
I never know if you're gonna kill yourself...

01:52:45.185 --> 01:52:47.149
or wreck the whole company...

01:52:47.150 --> 01:52:49.450
I think I did okay!

01:52:49.780 --> 01:52:51.739
I quit.
I'm resigning.

01:52:52.053 --> 01:52:54.096
That's it.

01:52:54.097 --> 01:52:57.226
What did you just say?
You're done?

01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:59.791
Surprising, I mean not
surprising.

01:52:59.792 --> 01:53:03.714
I get it.
You don't have to make any excuses.

01:53:03.715 --> 01:53:06.092
- I'm not making any excuses.
- Well you actually were just making excuses.

01:53:06.093 --> 01:53:09.644
I wasn't making an excuse but I'm actually very justified.

01:53:09.744 --> 01:53:11.521
You deserve better.

01:53:12.184 --> 01:53:14.316
You've taken such good care of me.

01:53:15.521 --> 01:53:17.758
I've been in tough spot
you got me through it, so.

01:53:17.817 --> 01:53:20.027
- Right?
- Thank you.

01:53:20.028 --> 01:53:23.407
- Yeah.
- Thank you for understanding.

01:53:23.408 --> 01:53:25.925
- Let's start clean up.
- I'll handle the transition. It'll be smooth.

01:53:25.926 --> 01:53:28.496
What about the press?
Because you only had the job for a week. That's gonna be...

01:53:28.497 --> 01:53:31.548
- With you it's like dog years.
- I know.

01:53:31.835 --> 01:53:33.216
I mean it's like the President.

01:53:45.228 --> 01:53:46.776
Weird.

01:53:46.793 --> 01:53:48.028
No it's not weird.

01:53:48.086 --> 01:53:50.671
- It's okay, right?
- Yeah.

01:53:50.672 --> 01:53:53.321
I think it was weird.

01:53:53.322 --> 01:53:56.721
You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.

01:53:56.722 --> 01:54:00.310
- I had just quit
- You don't have to do that.

01:54:00.311 --> 01:54:01.931
- I heard the whole thing.
- You should get lost.

01:54:01.933 --> 01:54:04.440
I was here first.
Get a roof.

01:54:04.441 --> 01:54:07.569
- I thought you were out of one-liners?
- That's the last one.

01:54:07.570 --> 01:54:10.244
- You kicked ass back there, by the way.
- Thank you. You too.

01:54:10.470 --> 01:54:13.390
Listen, my car got taken out in the explosions

01:54:13.391 --> 01:54:16.519
so I'm gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?

01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:18.792
Not okay with thats.

01:54:18.793 --> 01:54:22.970
It wasn't a question.

01:54:27.451 --> 01:54:29.228
I don't understand...

01:54:48.458 --> 01:54:51.252
I don't think I want you looking at that.

01:54:51.253 --> 01:54:53.927
I'm not sure it pertains to you anymore.

01:54:54.069 --> 01:55:00.082
Now this, on the other hand, is agent
Romanoff's assessment of you.

01:55:00.369 --> 01:55:02.731
Read it.

01:55:02.873 --> 01:55:07.112
Personality overview:
Mr Stark displays compulsive behavior.

01:55:07.274 --> 01:55:09.970
In my own defense, that
was last week.

01:55:11.822 --> 01:55:15.331
Prone to self-destructive tendencies.
I was dying.

01:55:15.411 --> 01:55:18.017
I mean, please, aren't we all?

01:55:18.018 --> 01:55:21.339
Textbook narcissism?

01:55:22.086 --> 01:55:24.552
Agreed.

01:55:26.175 --> 01:55:29.491
Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative,
Iron Man, yes.

01:55:29.492 --> 01:55:32.062
- I gotta think about it.
- Read on.

01:55:34.895 --> 01:55:38.237
Tony Stark not recommended?

01:55:38.984 --> 01:55:42.868
That doesn't make any sense. How can
you approve me but not approve me?

01:55:44.095 --> 01:55:49.293
I got a new ticker, I'm trying to do right
by Pepper.

01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:53.043
I'm in a stable-ish relationship.

01:55:53.044 --> 01:55:58.347
Which leads us to believe at this juncture
we'd only like to use you as a consultant.

01:56:04.435 --> 01:56:07.234
You can't afford me.

01:56:09.441 --> 01:56:12.361
Then again I will waive my customary retainer

01:56:12.362 --> 01:56:14.994
in exchange for a small favor.

01:56:15.928 --> 01:56:18.536
Rhodey and I are being honored in Washington

01:56:18.537 --> 01:56:21.086
and we need a presenter.

01:56:22.729 --> 01:56:24.277
I'll see what I can do.

01:56:25.755 --> 01:56:27.923
It is my honor to be here today

01:56:27.924 --> 01:56:32.596
to present these distinguished awards
to Lt. Col. James Rhodes

01:56:32.597 --> 01:56:36.377
and Mr. Tony Stark
who is of course

01:56:36.393 --> 01:56:38.900
a national treasure.

01:56:40.274 --> 01:56:44.152
Thank you Lieutenant Colonel
for such an exceptionally distinguished performance.

01:56:44.154 --> 01:56:47.246
- You deserve this.
- Thank you, sir.

01:56:48.368 --> 01:56:53.588
Mr Stark, thank you for
such an exceptionally distinguished performance.

01:56:53.709 --> 01:56:55.402
You deserve this.

01:56:56.107 --> 01:56:58.678
Oh sorry.

01:56:59.549 --> 01:57:03.642
Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn't it?

01:57:03.930 --> 01:57:05.519
Let's get a photo.
