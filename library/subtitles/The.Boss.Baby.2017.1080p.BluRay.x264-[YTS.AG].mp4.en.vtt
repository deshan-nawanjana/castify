WEBVTT

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.952
Survival of the fittest.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.235
It's the law of the jungle.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.278
There's always someone trying
to take what's yours.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.469
How do I know?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.275
It almost happened to me.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:14.480
Hi-yah!

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.559
Tim Templeton...

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.948
quit monkeying around.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.758
Hot dogs are getting cold.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.114
Hot dogs?

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.236
At least, this is how I remember it.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.560
All right, buddy, let's eat.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.477
You see, I was seven years old...

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.598
and back then,
you relied on your imagination.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:36.557
When I wasn't exploring the Congo...

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.950
I was a deep sea diver.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.150
Tim!

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320
Our hero!

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.634
Don't worry, Mom and Dad.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.800
I got this!

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.629
Grab on!

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.230
Some days, I rescued my parents.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.440
That way!

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.232
Other days, they rescued me.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.111
- I'm losing control.
- Tim, look out!

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.039
Tree!

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.030
You're breaking up!

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.200
Slow down, Tim!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.679
- Turn, Tim.
- Turn!

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.799
- Are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.075
Show Mommy your teeth.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.918
It was just the three of us.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.354
The Templetons.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.670
And three is the perfect number.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.840
Interesting fact...

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.798
did you know that the triangle
is the strongest shape found in nature?

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.351
I was the luckiest kid ever.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.670
My parents even had cool jobs.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.519
They worked for the biggest pet company
in the world...

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.720
Puppy Co.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.631
- Yes, Mr. F rancis?
- Puppy Co needs you.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.835
It's go ti me.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.311
They worked in a department
called "Marketing..."

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.671
where they got to launch new products.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.593
Even though my parents
worked really hard...

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.120
they still made just enough time for me.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.039
Three stories, five hugs,
and my special song, right?

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240
You got it!

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.792
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.230
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.789
All your life

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.556
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.150
Hey, Tim. How would you like
to have a baby brother?

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.470
No, thanks. I'm enough.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.551
Life was good. Life was perfect.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.358
But as I drifted off to sleep...

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.478
something my parents said
got me thinking.

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.710
Where do babies come from?

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.309
The day I got a little brother
started like any other day...

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.878
but little did I know...

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.952
my life would never be the same.

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.958
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a.m.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.520
Wake up, little halflings!

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.470
Morning, Wizzie!

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.315
What great adventure
lies in wait for you today?

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:42.080
Oh, yeah!

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:48.631
My parents always said
that I had an overactive imagination.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.839
But I clearly remember...

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.390
the baby was delivered in a taxi.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
What the...

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.200
Hey!

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.878
Tim, look who's here.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:49.037
Meet your new baby brother.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.349
Baby what?

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.751
Brother.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.717
I had a million questions.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.711
Who is this guy? Why is he here?

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880
What's with that outfit?

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:01.355
Why's he so fat? Why's he staring at me?

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.351
Does he know karate? What's going on?

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.070
That way?

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.240
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.016
Right from the start,
he was yelling at people...

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.678
ordering everyone around.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:12.393
Oh, you want this?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.236
One thing was clear. He was the boss.

00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.111
He set up his office, right
smack dab in the middle of the house.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.400
He conducted meetings.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.431
- You called?
- Do you need Señor Squeaky?

00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:28.913
Lots and lots of meetings.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.752
Even in the middle of the night.

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.033
I'm up! I'm up!

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:35.736
- We're coming!
- We'll be right there!

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.957
If things weren't done
to his immediate satisfaction...

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.556
he had a fit.

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:51.593
- Where's the bottle?
- He has to have his bottle!

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.553
He had everyone wrapped around
his chubby little finger.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:08:58.111
Everyone except for me.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.908
- Diaper!
- Bottle!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.956
Dad! I can't sleep.

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.633
I know, bud. Me neither.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.916
The baby needs a lot of attention
right now.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.080
Okay, good talk!

00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.355
- But...
- It's okay.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.635
Daddy's here. Daddy's here.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
What about me?

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.596
The year: 2057.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:22.038
Ensign T-Rex and I are investigating
a hostile alien invasion.

00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.151
It's so much worse than we thought.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.719
Mom, he's naked!

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.840
I'm naked!

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.149
Say "naked."

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:04.320
No!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.514
Who's Mommy's little cutie?
Are you Mommy's little cutie?

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.035
No, he's Daddy's little tough guy,
right?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.760
You know one of us has to go
with Mr. Francis to the pet convention.

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:18.068
In Vegas.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.440
- You know what? You should go.
- No, no. You should go.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.520
Well, you need a break.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.336
- I'll stay with the baby, and you...
- Maybe the baby should decide.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:27.670
Who do you want to stay with you?
Daddy or Mommy?

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:28.989
Or Daddy?

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.593
He wants his mommy.

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.557
Okay, we need to talk!

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.755
In private.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.279
- Sure.
- About what, bud?

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:39.431
About the b-a-b-e-e.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.359
"Y ', ' Tim.

00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.238
Why? Because he came out of nowhere!

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400
We don't even know him.

00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:45.754
How can we trust him?

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:47.672
Come on, he's just a baby.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:53.714
Seriously? I'm the only one that thinks
there's something weird about this guy?

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.911
- Oopsie! I got it.
- Five-second rule.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.348
Tim?

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:09.753
Look at him! He wears a suit!

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.593
I know. Isn't it cute?
He's like a little man.

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.591
He carries a briefcase.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.557
Does no else think that's...

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.950
I don't know, a little freaky?

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:22.599
Well, you carried Lam-Lam around
until you were like...

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.273
This is not about Lam-Lam.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:27.559
All babies are different, Tim.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.073
And each one is special.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.958
He's taking over the whole house!

00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:32.439
Are you taking over the house?

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.397
Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:38.119
Trust me, one day you're gonna
get to know this little guy...

00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:40.794
and you are gonna love him
with all of your heart.

00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:41.960
Just like we do.

00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.753
All of your heart?

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.471
Never.

00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.190
Hello!

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.989
It's time for my three stories,
five hugs, and special song!

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:21.191
How about one story...

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.477
three hugs, and my special song?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.230
Just my special song?

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.833
Mom?

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.514
Dad?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.828
Hey.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:41.752
What happened to bedtime?

00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.040
We'll have it on Monday, Mr. Francis.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.997
Don't cry! Don't cry.

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.240
Hello?

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.272
Hello? No, ma'am, not yet.

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.550
No, I'm not making excuses.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:09.513
Yes, ma'am,
I know I've been here a long time.

00:13:09.720 --> 00:13:12.029
Believe me, it feels like my whole life.

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.033
I'm making great progress
with the parents already.

00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.557
The usual procedure,
sleep deprivation, hunger strikes.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:27.392
They're very disoriented.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.949
I've got them
eating out of the palm of my hand.

00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:32.390
They do everything for me.

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.709
It's hilarious.

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.472
But I think the kid might be on to me.

00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:38.396
No, I can handle him.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:40.755
I know how important this mission is
to the company.

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.154
Mission?

00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.153
Well, trust me, ma'am.
You got the right baby for this job.

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:46.753
Hands up, devil baby!

00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920
Fart! Poop! Doodie!

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.993
I've gotta deal with the k-i-d.

00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.160
You can talk!

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.591
Uh, goo-goo ga-ga.

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:58.990
No, you can really talk. I heard you!

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.070
Fine. I can talk.

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.560
Now, let's see if you can listen.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.680
Get me a double espresso...

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.896
and see if there's someplace around here
with decent sushi.

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.992
I'd kill for a spicy tuna roll
right about now.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.758
Get yourself a little something.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.433
Who are you?

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.195
Let's just say I'm the boss.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:20.591
The boss?
You're a baby! You wear a diaper.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:22.352
You know who else wears diapers?

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:24.954
Astronauts and NASCAR drivers,
that's who.

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.520
It's called efficiency, Templeton.

00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.428
The average toddler spends, what?
45 hours a year on the potty?

00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:33.950
I'm the boss.
I don't have that kind of spare time.

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.678
Well, you're not the boss of me.

00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:37.956
- I am the boss of you.
- No, you're not.

00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.120
- Am, too.
- Are not.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:40.554
- Am, too!
- Are not!

00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:42.269
- Am, too.
- Are not!

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.480
- Am, too.
- Are not!

00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.108
Am, too. Am, too.

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.320
I was here first.

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.550
Just wait until Mom and Dad find out
about this.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.029
Oh, yeah?
You think they'd pick you over me?

00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.719
With your track record?

00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:55.472
You don't know anything about me.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.389
So that's how you wanna play it, huh?
Let's see.

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.190
Templeton, Timothy. Middle name...

00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:04.990
I'm sorry.

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:05.990
Leslie!

00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.878
- Mostly C's...
- How do you know all that?

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.156
Can't ride a bike without training wheels?

00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:14.313
Even bears can ride a bike
without training wheels, Leslie.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.235
DOB says you're seven.

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.674
Seven and a half.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.551
Power nap! You were saying?

00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:23.153
I'm seven and a half.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.833
Exactly! You're old.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.912
It's time to make way
for the next generation.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.354
It's the way of the world.

00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.750
You would never ask your parents
for an old toy.

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:32.920
Lam-Lam?

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.216
Everyone wants the hot, new thing.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.719
Destroy. Destroy.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.348
- Lam-Lam!
- I've got fresh batteries.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.520
Boom!

00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:41.272
Mom and Dad don't even know you.

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:42.714
They love me!

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.353
Oh, yeah? Do the math, kid.

00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:46.909
There's only so much love to go around.

00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:48.957
It's like these beads.

00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.509
You used to have all your parents' love.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.950
All their time. All their attention.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.190
You had all the beads.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.918
But then I came along.

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.957
Babies take up a lot of time.

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.556
They need a lot of attention.
They get all the love.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:05.399
We could share.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:07.790
You obviously didn't go to business school.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:14.917
Look, Templeton,
the numbers just don't add up.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:17.389
There's not enough love
for the two of us.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.710
Not enough beads to go around.

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:23.475
And then, all of a sudden,
there's no place for Tim.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:25.153
Tim doesn't fit anymore.

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:27.709
Oh, no! What about Tim?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.309
So keep quiet. Stay out of my way.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:36.311
Or there's gonna be cutbacks.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.629
You can't be fired from your own family.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.433
Can you?

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:09.512
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a.m.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.795
Wake up, little half...

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:13.393
What's the use?

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.714
Arise for a nutritious breakfast!

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.279
It's 7:00 a.m.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.438
What's wrong, Timothy?

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.636
Has that little dwarf made you blue?

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:30.950
Mm-hmm.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.759
Then I shall cast upon him
a great curse!

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.275
He shall not pass!

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.793
It's no use, Wizzie.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.791
He's got Mom and Dad completely fooled.

00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.952
If they knew what I knew,
they'd never let him stay.

00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.797
Perhaps your parents
need to be enlightened.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.116
With a great curse!

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:50.554
They shall not pass!

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.551
Yeah. I need to enlighten them...

00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:54.834
with proof!

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.558
That's what I need, proof!

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.911
Expose his dark magic!

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.839
Testing, testing.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.314
Testing, testing.

00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:13.136
Maybe they can return him to the store...

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.354
and get their money back!

00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.112
We could buy a bouncy house!

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.670
Godspeed, Tim! It's 8:45 a.m.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.320
Ninja.

00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.520
Ninja.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.880
Ninja.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:53.838
Ninja.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.154
Babies everywhere! They're spreading.

00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.914
Mom! Dad! What's going on?

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.078
It's an invasion!

00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:22.557
It's a play date!

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.239
That's a keeper.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.039
It's a meeting,
and you won't be attending.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.038
We'll see about that.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:41.672
Thank you all for coming here
on such short notice.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:43.068
Now, before we begin...

00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:45.870
Yes, sir!

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:47.274
- Sure is!
- Affirmative!

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.112
Jimbo, run some interference.

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:51.715
Hey!

00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:54.440
- We babies are having a crisis!
- Oh, no!

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.669
- That's awful!
- Horrible!

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.880
What is it?

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.759
It's simpler if I just show you.
Teddy, if you please.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:01.598
Let's put on a show.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:04.869
Here we go!

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:06.268
Jimbo, hit the lights.

00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.271
You see, babies aren't getting
as much love as we used to.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.198
Why? Have we been bad?

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:14.360
No, Staci.

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.118
But I'll tell you who is.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:19.716
Behold our mortal enemy.
Puppies!

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.076
No! That's exactly the problem.

00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:25.714
Puppies? What's the deal with puppies?

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:26.949
Throughout history...

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:31.358
people have loved babies
more than anything in the world.

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.158
We've always been a must-have item...

00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.595
number one on every wish list.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.672
Puppies were merely accessories.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.358
But all that changed
when the puppies began coming out...

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.511
with new designer models.

00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:48.280
Each one more adorable than the last.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:50.237
Remember the Labradoodle?

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.594
The Peekapoo?

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.638
The Chiweenie?
Try to say "Chiweenie" without smiling.

00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.360
Not possible. Don't waste your time.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.072
We all laughed at the Shar Pei.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.950
And now it's number one in China.

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.440
- Oh, no.
- That's terrible!

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.318
- Horrible!
- Yes.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:06.799
And it gets even worse.

00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:10.669
Francis Francis, the CEO of Puppy Co,
made this announcement.

00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:12.239
Teddy, roll the clip.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.391
And we are on schedule...

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:18.030
to release the most adorable puppy ever.

00:21:18.200 --> 00:21:21.988
We're gonna launch it
at the pet convention in Las Vegas!

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.434
Watch out, world!

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.194
It's gonna crush the competition!

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.268
- Yay!
- No, Jimbo.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.635
No "yay"! We are the competition!

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:32.119
This is war.

00:21:32.280 --> 00:21:34.714
Puppies are winning,
and babies are losing.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.710
Thank you, Teddy.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.950
And if this new puppy
is as cute as we fear...

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:40.634
it could put the baby business
out of business, baby.

00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:41.800
That's awful!

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.960
Bad news, baby!

00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.393
What are we going to do?

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:46.869
My job is to find out exactly what
that new puppy is...

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.712
so that Baby Corp can stop it.

00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.233
And you're going to help me.

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.150
- Genius!
- Home run!

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320
You still got it, boss!

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.190
Yay!

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:54.110
Yay.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:56.157
Now, your parents all work for Puppy Co.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.470
So have you learned anything from them?

00:21:58.640 --> 00:21:59.914
- Yes, sir!
- Sure did!

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.195
Fantastic. Triplets, go!

00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.156
- A.
- B.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.320
- C.
- D.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.590
No, what have you learned
about the new puppy?

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.915
Yay, puppy!

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.798
No, Jimbo! Puppies are evil.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.234
Staci, read back the notes.

00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:12.960
I can't read. What's it say?

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:17.952
This is my team?

00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.839
A muscle-head, a bunch of yes men,
and a doodler?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:21.796
- Exactly!
- Affirmative!

00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:22.631
Good call.

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:23.840
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice one, BB!

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:24.989
Gotcha!

00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:29.199
Put that cookie down.
Cookies are for closers.

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.920
- Let's have another show!
- No, Teddy!

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.758
- How about a hug?
- No more shows!

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:33.511
Boss?

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:36.148
- There's plenty of love to go around.
- Go to sleep!

00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:37.355
Nighty-night.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:38.350
- Boss!
- Boss!

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.520
- What?
- Parents!

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.320
It's like they're having their own
little meeting.

00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:50.397
- Isn't that adorable?
- Who wants dessert?

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:52.634
God, this is so humiliating.

00:22:53.720 --> 00:22:55.358
God, this is so humiliating.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.039
Wait until Mom and Dad hear this.

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:00.955
Hey, Templeton, what you got there?

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.034
Nothing.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.519
Hand over the tape.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800
Never!

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.990
Mom! Dad! Over here!

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:20.355
- Hi, Timmy!
- Hi! Anyway...

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.075
Flower power!

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.639
You can't get away from Johnny Law,
simpleton.

00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.034
Fasten your seat belt. Let's go!

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.829
Run, run, run.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:47.549
What? Hey!

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:51.640
Uh-oh.

00:23:56.560 --> 00:23:57.788
Run, run, run.

00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.473
Catch, catch, catch.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.960
Yes!

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:12.920
Oh, yeah!

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.158
Let go, you little...

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.436
Oh, look!
The kids are finally getting along.

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.914
That's nice.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.880
Sayonara!

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280
You wanna play?

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.840
Let's play.

00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.598
No!

00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:54.115
Save Boss! Save Boss!

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:58.600
- Get him!
- I got him!

00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.760
- I got him!
- I got him!

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:08.072
You're toast, baby man!

00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.231
Upsies, I need upsies!

00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:15.319
Who wants...

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.595
Cheese sticks!

00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:22.830
Mom, Dad! I've got proof!

00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:31.351
Someone can't go down the stairs?

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.910
Nothing can stop me!

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.033
Mom! Dad! Where are you guys?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:48.200
Hello?

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.753
Where did everyone go?

00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.675
Mom, Dad! The baby can talk!

00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:54.512
Oh, can he now?

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.954
Wait, how did you...

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.314
Hand over the tape, Timmy.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.959
Or Lam-Lam gets it, see?

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:00.880
No!

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.235
What's that, Lam-Lam?
You want a nose ring?

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:06.278
It's really not my scene,
but who am I to judge?

00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.476
And an eyebrow ring?
Seems like a little too much, Lam-Lam.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.877
How's that gonna look in a job interview?

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:13.870
Stop it!

00:26:14.040 --> 00:26:15.951
The tape, Timmy!
Or I'm gonna rip, rip, rip.

00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.235
No! Let go!

00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:18.440
- You let go!
- You let go!

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:20.040
- Give me the tape!
- Give me Lam-Lam!

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:24.952
Whoops! Too far.

00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.078
Templeton!
Templeton, let's be reasonable.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.120
We can be reasonable, right?
What are you doing?

00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:31.236
You've been asking for this
since you got here!

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.112
We can talk about this over a juice box!

00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.833
Time for juice boxes is over.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.309
No, Templeton. You wouldn't.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:39.596
Say bye-bye, baby! You're fired!

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:40.510
What are you doing?

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680
Nothing.

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840
My proof!

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.678
Tim! Explain yourself!

00:26:48.840 --> 00:26:49.955
Yes, explain yourself.

00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.758
It wasn't me! It was the baby's fault.

00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.029
The baby's fault?

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.952
It's true! He can talk.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.756
They all can talk.
They were having a meeting.

00:26:57.920 --> 00:26:59.176
There's something about puppies.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.350
It's one big baby con-spy-racy!

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:03.192
Timothy Leslie Templeton!

00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:04.839
We are very disappointed in you.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.355
- No, we're mad at you!
- Exactly, we're mad at you.

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.118
- Mad?
- You need a time-out!

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:10.998
- You're grounded!
- Yes, grounded!

00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.160
- For two...
- Three!

00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:13.355
- Three days?
- Weeks!

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:14.748
Weeks! Three weeks!

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.751
For three... evers!

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.670
Grounded?

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.559
You're gonna stay in this house
with your baby brother...

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.029
until you learn to get along.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:25.320
Great.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.478
It was my first time behind bars.

00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:32.312
The big house.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.799
The lock-up.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.032
Grounded for life.

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:40.235
The minutes turned into hours,
the hours into days.

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.231
Every man has his breaking point.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.279
This was mine.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.877
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:53.069
- Take these broken wings and learn to fly
- Hey, that's my song.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.995
All your life

00:27:56.840 --> 00:28:01.038
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.591
It's okay, little halfling.

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:06.354
Perhaps I can be of some assistance.

00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.913
Blackbird singing in the dead of night!

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:15.591
Pray, take these broken wings
and learn to fly!

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.352
Fly, you fools!

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.635
Thanks, Wizzie.

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.038
But it's not the same.

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.839
If only I could reach my magical shank.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.468
I could break us out of this big house.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:30.160
Templeton!

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.118
Templeton, we have to talk.

00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.320
Go away.

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:50.070
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:52.796
Stop it!

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.558
That's my song, not yours.

00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.517
My parents wrote it just for me.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.955
Really?
Your parents are Lennon and McCartney?

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:01.350
No, Ted and Janice.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.839
You don't even know their names!

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.640
You're just trying to steal them from me.

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.954
You stole everything!

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.792
You're the one who should be in jail!

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:11.872
Look, it's time
we put our differences aside.

00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:16.280
Have you been...

00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.440
No!

00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:20.953
Where's HR when you need them?

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:50.950
Take it.

00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.838
I don't want your filthy money.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.150
Look, I told you to stay out of my way.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.151
I can't! You're in my house.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:58.469
I don't wanna be here...

00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.278
any more than you want me to be here.

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:02.311
Then why are you torturing me?

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.948
The truth is I'm no ordinary baby.

00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.120
Well, no kidding.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.316
I'm on a mission from above.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:10.675
Are you the Baby Jesus?

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.435
Yes. I'm the Baby Jesus.

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.440
No!

00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.994
You see, I'm more middle management
for the company.

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.116
The company? What company?

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.280
Here.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:24.196
Take this. It'll explain everything.

00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.952
What do you want me to do with that?

00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.511
- I want you to suck it.
- You suck it!

00:30:29.720 --> 00:30:30.516
No, it's for you to suck.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.720
I'm not sucking that!

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.456
- Suck it.
- I don't know where it's been!

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:36.358
It's not where it's been.
It's where it will take you.

00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:37.560
Don't you wanna know...

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:39.597
where babies really come from?

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:43.599
Binky. Papish. Nuk-Nuk.

00:30:43.760 --> 00:30:45.955
Boo-Boo. Bo-Bo. Bah-Bah.

00:30:46.120 --> 00:30:48.429
Chupie. Hushie-Baby. Tootsie.

00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.636
It goes by many names.

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.758
But through its power,
you will know the truth.

00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:01.760
Come on, faster!

00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.040
Mommy!

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.948
Where are we?

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:27.475
Welcome to Baby Corp!

00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:34.874
No way.

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.308
- Thank you.
- What?

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:42.470
Relax. They can't see us or hear us.

00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:44.551
- We're, like, virtual and stuff?
- Yep.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.312
- You mean they won't feel this?
- Nope.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.629
- Or this?
- Nada.

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.840
Karate!

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.514
Don't embarrass yourself, Templeton.
I can still see you.

00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:54.597
So this is where babies come from?

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.876
Where'd you think, the cabbage patch?

00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040
Magic fairies?

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.196
No, my parents told me that...

00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.554
What?

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:04.756
No. That's disgusting.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:07.150
Yeah, it didn't sound right to me, either.

00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.389
I can't believe
my parents didn't tell me about this.

00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.836
If people knew where babies really
came from, they'd never have one.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:15.718
Same thing with hot dogs, by the way.

00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.279
Going upsies!

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.352
So how come I don't remember this place?

00:32:20.520 --> 00:32:21.350
You did.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.760
But after normal babies
get their pacifiers taken away...

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.871
you forget all about Baby Corp.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:27.359
How come you're not normal?

00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:29.750
A few of us, the best of the best...

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:31.512
are selected for the...

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.952
For the ultimate honor.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.558
Upper management.

00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:42.190
This, Templeton,
is where all the action is.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:44.715
Nap time in Sector G.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.277
So this whole place is run by babies?

00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.480
Yep.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.710
My Dad says, "Those who can, do."

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.313
"And those who can't, supervise."

00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:53.788
Your father is a hippy.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:56.913
What happens when you grow up?

00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:57.916
We don't.

00:32:58.120 --> 00:33:01.396
We drink a super-secret baby formula
that keeps us babies forever.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:05.708
Back to work! Formula break is over!

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:07.319
We're in a crisis here!

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.000
Don't you know we're in a crisis here?

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.160
Who is that?

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:12.800
That is my boss. Big Boss Baby.

00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.916
What is she screaming about?

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.479
Well, see this pie chart?

00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:18.956
Wow, it looks like a giant pie.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:21.588
It represents all the love there is
in the world.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.988
- I love pie.
- Who doesn't?

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.990
- Apple.
- Fine.

00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:25.160
- No, cherry!
- Perfect!

00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.240
- Not pumpkin.
- Okay.

00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.076
That's a vegetable.

00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:30.835
Point is, the puppies' slice
is getting bigger and bigger.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.598
They're stealing all our love!

00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.753
Just like you did to me.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.920
Exactly.

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.112
And if this keeps up...

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.794
there might not be enough pie left
for babies.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960
No pie?

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:44.758
No pie.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:57.273
So, my mission is to find out
what this new puppy is.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:59.431
So you're, like, on a spy mission? Cool!

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.279
Yes! Cool!
And if... When I succeed...

00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.829
I'll become a Baby Corp legend.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.639
Like Super Big Boss Baby,
Mega Boss Baby...

00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:09.631
Seriously Big Boss Baby...

00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:11.400
and him.

00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:14.119
Now that's a big, fat baby.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:16.711
No, that's Big Fat Boss Baby.

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:20.634
This is Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.156
He was the youngest Chief Executive Infant
in the history of the company.

00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.992
Was? What happened to him?

00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.798
Retired, years ago.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.991
But I still try and live up to his legend.

00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:31.832
In every situation, I ask myself...

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.991
"W-W-S-C-B-F-B-B-D?

00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:37.320
"What Would Super Colossal
Big Fat Boss Baby Do?"

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.878
So that's all you get?
Your picture on the wall?

00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.314
Come here!

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.075
I'll get a promotion.

00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.196
The corner office...

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:48.191
with my own private potty.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.748
Wow.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:52.354
So when you're done,
you're coming back here?

00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.078
A-S-A-P, T-i-m.

00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.834
I'm not a family man.
I belong behind a desk.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.831
- That's awesome!
- I know, right?

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.509
- Pew pew.
- What?

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:05.195
So help me,
I will nail his diaper to the wall!

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.510
Have we heard anything
from that little Boss Baby...

00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:09.193
that we sent down to the T empletons?

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.918
- I don't know.
- You're fired!

00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:11.876
Oh, no.

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.189
You're all fired!

00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:15.191
The pet convention is in two days.

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.873
If he doesn't come up with answers...

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.598
he is fired, retired!

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:20.512
- Gone!
- Tour's over.

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.875
What was Big Bossy Baby Lady
screaming about?

00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:27.270
She's demanding actual results.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.352
The pet convention is in two days,
and I've got nothing!

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.394
That's her! Don't answer it!

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:41.880
Stress nap!

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.435
If I don't find out
what that new puppy is and fast...

00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.240
not only will I not get that promotion...

00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.628
I could get fired!

00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:53.440
Hey, relax.

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:55.755
I'm sure there's other cool jobs
for babies, right?

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.076
Meanwhile, two days goes by like that.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:35:59.309
You better start packing.

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:00.480
What?

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.919
You don't get it, Templeton.

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.594
If I'm fired,
they'll take away my formula.

00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:07.671
I will turn into a normal baby...

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.592
and live here forever with you.

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:11.034
- No!
- Yes!

00:36:11.200 --> 00:36:12.918
And I promise you this...

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.514
Every morning you wake up...

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.238
I'll be there.

00:36:19.040 --> 00:36:20.519
Every night, at dinner...

00:36:20.920 --> 00:36:22.558
I'll be there.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.392
Every birthday party...

00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:26.551
I'll be there.

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.199
Every Christmas!

00:36:28.360 --> 00:36:29.509
I'll be there

00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.240
Year after year after year.

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.231
We will grow old together.

00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.679
You and I...

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:46.351
will be brothers.

00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.080
Always.

00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:50.190
- No. No, this is terrible!
- I know.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.032
- This can't be happening.
- But it is!

00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:53.456
- You can't stay here!
- I can't!

00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:55.072
- Don't panic!
- But it feels right!

00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.071
I know, but we have to fix this.

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.791
We have to make sure
you don't get fired.

00:36:59.960 --> 00:37:00.960
We?

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:02.311
We.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:03.754
I will help you...

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:06.148
but just to get rid of you.

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.548
Deal?

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.270
Deal.

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.078
Here's to never seeing you again.

00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.719
Back at ya, baby.

00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.592
Now let's get to work.

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:20.318
Come on, come on, come on.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:21.637
Slice!

00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:23.239
No, no.

00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.310
There's nothing here about a new puppy.

00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.833
Aren't you gonna do any work?

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.319
I'm very busy delegating.

00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:31.240
He drains it!

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:34.871
So once we find the file
on the new puppy...

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.040
what do we do then?

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:37.758
Send in the baby ninjas?

00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:38.920
Even better.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.832
I'm going to write the perfect memo.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.194
- Boom!
- Boom!

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.630
Wait. What's a memo?

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:48.031
A memo is something you write
to give people information.

00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:50.674
That's your plan?
You're gonna write a book report?

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.512
That's so boring.

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:53.908
No, Templeton.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.680
Memos are for important things.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.274
A memo can bring people together.

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:01.954
A memo can be a call to arms...

00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:04.634
a manifesto, a poem.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.559
A memo can change the world.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:11.318
Wow! When you explain it like that...

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.118
it still sounds boring.

00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.119
You'll learn, kid.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.280
You'll learn.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.636
Wait a second. This is it!

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:20.119
What? What is it?

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:22.714
Check this out.
Take Your Kid to Work Day.

00:38:23.880 --> 00:38:27.395
People take children
to a place of business? Why?

00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:28.959
Because it's awesome!

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.116
It's disgusting.

00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:33.396
Don't you see?
We can get inside Puppy Co...

00:38:33.560 --> 00:38:35.118
and find out what the new puppy is!

00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.280
What's the point?

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:39.835
You're grounded.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:42.076
Your parents aren't
going to take us anywhere.

00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.591
You're right.
They think we hate each other.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.392
Hate is a strong word.

00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:49.039
It's the right word, but still.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:53.076
We have to convince them
that we're actual brothers.

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.110
Right.

00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.838
That we...

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.200
Loathe?

00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.360
No.

00:38:58.560 --> 00:38:59.356
Like!

00:38:59.560 --> 00:39:00.834
No. That we...

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:04.758
La, la, la...

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.194
Le, le, le...

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.195
No.

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.715
No way. No. You don't mean...

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.878
Love each other.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:18.190
I just threw up a noodle
and swallowed it.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.736
- Here comes the choo-choo train!
- No.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:21.936
- Choo, choo, chugga, chugga.
- No choo-choo!

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.872
Hold the train! No!
It looks like it's already been eaten!

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.473
Who's there? I got a racket!

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.914
What's going on in here?

00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.718
I'm just feeding the baby.

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.828
They're watching.

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.154
Choo-choo.

00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.111
Okay.

00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.589
Choo-choo on that.

00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.799
I don't wear nautical.
It's not even Friday!

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.598
Come on, you're putting this thing on!

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.876
You gonna make me?
You can't make me, punk.

00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.160
- What have you done to me?
- Stop!

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.633
- Get back here!
- No!

00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.200
No way.

00:40:00.280 --> 00:40:01.280
Come on!

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.952
Tim, what are you doing in here?

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:05.120
Oh, no.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.320
Hey, what's all the racket?

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.553
Isn't he adorable?

00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.717
I've got one for you, too! Ahoy, matey!

00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:14.710
What?

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.630
Bummer.

00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:16.835
Smile!

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:20.592
Smile for the camera.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:22.478
It makes me feel weak.

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.676
- Who's ticklish?
- It doesn't work on me.

00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:26.000
- Here?
- I'm dead down there.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.872
Come on, everyone has a tickle spot.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.230
"'I don't think I'll fit, ' said Gretel."

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.956
Come here, look at this.

00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.151
"'I could get in myself.'

00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:38.912
"And then, Hansel and Gretel...

00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:41.554
"pushed the wicked old woman
into the oven.

00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:45.269
"And the godless witch
was miserably burnt to death."

00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:52.068
Let me get this straight.

00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:55.357
The story is about cannibalism
and burning people alive.

00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:56.270
Yeah.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.476
No wonder kids are so messed up!

00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.830
Getting along is exhausting.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Back at ya, Tim.

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:04.071
You should have seen your face
in that picture.

00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.275
You were all...

00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.672
I'm not used to being tickled.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.434
Once at a corporate retreat.
But those things always get weird.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.876
What? You've never been tickled?
What about your parents?

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.833
I'm sorry. I forgot.

00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:21.868
You didn't have parents, did you?

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.435
Tim, I may look like a baby...

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.956
but I was born all grown up.

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.828
I can't even imagine not being a kid.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.195
You missed out on your whole childhood?

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.875
You never had someone to love you?

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:43.155
You can't miss what you never had.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.598
Wake up, little halflings!

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.512
Hey, Tim. Wake up, buddy.

00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:14.432
- What?
- Rise and shine!

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.953
Is something wrong? Am I fired?

00:42:16.520 --> 00:42:17.953
No, you're late for work.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:18.950
What?

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:21.190
It's Take Your Kid to Work Day!
And you're the kid.

00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:23.112
You're officially un-grounded.

00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.633
- Really?
- Really.

00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.474
Can the baby come, too?

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.789
I don't see why not.

00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:30.269
Yes! Yes, yes, yes!

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.796
Yeah!

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.552
I wish I was that excited for work.

00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:35.119
Look, it's my spatula.

00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:06.154
Yeah, baby.

00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:14.509
All right, gentlemen.
Welcome to Puppy Co.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.557
Wow! This is awesome!

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:29.720
And Tim, look!

00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.118
They have a puppy pool and everything!

00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.508
Isn't that sanitary?

00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.069
Hey, bud, you wanna get a picture
with Puppy Co Pete?

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.349
No, thanks.
It's probably too scary for the baby.

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.520
Nice call.

00:43:46.920 --> 00:43:49.036
Your dad and I
have some work to do.

00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.555
You wanna come up to the office
and hang out with us?

00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:53.551
We'll stick your brother
in the Puppy Zone...

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.551
while we have a little Tim time.

00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.960
Tim time?

00:43:57.120 --> 00:44:00.476
Dad and I know we haven't been able
to do as much with you as we used to.

00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.232
So, what do you say?

00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:12.200
No, thanks.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:13.952
I'd rather spend time with the baby.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.679
- So cute.
- That's so sweet.

00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:21.880
Way to keep your eyes on the prize,
Templeton.

00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.634
We find out what the new puppy is,
and I go home.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.237
You guys stay in the Puppy Zone, okay?

00:44:27.560 --> 00:44:28.913
Okay, bye!

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.840
That's where we'll find
the secret file on the new puppy.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.399
We'll never get through that door.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.959
No, not that door.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:56.595
The doggy door.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.956
But how do we get past the guard?

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.315
No, no, no.
No way.

00:45:06.480 --> 00:45:07.480
No!

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:12.108
Itchy, plushy, puppy pants!

00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.789
What a cute, little pup...

00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:17.960
Ow!

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.630
Yay!

00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:20.800
Kids.

00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.959
Get down.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.637
All the way down.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:33.318
I've never been so humiliated
in all my life.

00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:40.480
Arf!

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:48.680
Hey!

00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.555
Fetch!

00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:57.152
What am I doing?

00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640
Oh, no!

00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.520
Yes!

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:17.520
What a good boy.

00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.399
No. No biting.

00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:24.668
Timothy Templeton, office ninja.

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.837
- Over here.
- What is it?

00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.159
It's gotta be in here.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.159
It's begging us to go in.

00:46:37.680 --> 00:46:38.680
Wow.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:40.597
That's a lot of paperwork.

00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:43.037
I thought puppies shredded everything.

00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.072
This is getting creepy.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:50.838
I've come for your soul.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Cut it out!

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.234
Wait!

00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:55.589
That's it!

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760
The file!

00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:58.518
See! I was right.

00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:02.353
No. I've seen this before somewhere.

00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:04.556
We've gotta find something
to replace it with.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:06.597
You're right. Like another file.

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.233
Yes! A file with the same weight.

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.630
So it can be placed
in the exact same position.

00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:12.920
- With the exact same weight.
- You already said that.

00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.753
I know I said it. Hey, you hit me twice.

00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:17.638
Make it a third time. Wait!

00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.358
I think I've seen one here.

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.029
Smead manila, pressboard edges.

00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:26.430
About 50 ounces. No, 49.

00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:27.600
Try this one.

00:47:28.280 --> 00:47:29.280
Wait!

00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.275
Now it's perfect.

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.320
Yes!

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:06.478
I feel like we should run.

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.359
I know, but it's just so mesmerizing.

00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:12.439
I kind of wanna see how it ends.

00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:13.600
Yeah, me too.

00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.632
Well, that didn't end well.

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.549
What?

00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.840
What the...?

00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:38.191
Thanks for dropping in, kids.

00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.793
Francis Francis?

00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.269
I see you've met my big brother, Eugene.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.993
A man of few words.

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:45.989
None, in fact.

00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:48.628
Can you put your head back on, please?

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.353
What is all this?

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.794
Surprise!

00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:56.679
A Baby Corp binky?
Where did you get that?

00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:59.237
You don't recognize me?

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:02.233
Perhaps from my youth!

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.151
Super Colossal Big Fat Boss Baby?

00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:12.353
He is him? And him is you?

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:15.353
Except older and wrinklier.

00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.148
That's not right.

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:21.311
No. You were my hero!

00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:23.238
How did you end up here?

00:49:24.040 --> 00:49:27.077
You know what I do to little kids
who ask lots of questions about me?

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.514
Eugene!

00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.231
I read them my story.

00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:39.711
And, I baked cookies!

00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:42.433
Eugene, my chair.

00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:47.276
Now, it all started at Baby Corp...

00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:49.874
a long, long time ago.

00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.349
I was a hotshot executive...

00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:54.238
headed straight to the top.

00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.709
Everyone loved me.

00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:59.189
They gave me a promotion,
the corner office...

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.713
my very own...

00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:01.949
Personal potty?

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.916
I had it all.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:06.080
But then one day...

00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:08.396
I made a terrible discovery.

00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:10.790
I was getting old.

00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.712
The formula wasn't working anymore.

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.077
It turns out I was lactose intolerant.

00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.429
- No!
- Yes!

00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.558
I got called in
to see the board of directors.

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:22.119
Who are the boring directors?

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.714
The biggest baby bosses of them all.

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.598
I thought they loved me.

00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.399
But they replaced me with someone new.

00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.599
Someone younger.

00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.079
That's horrible.

00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:35.959
All of a sudden, she got all the love...

00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:37.792
all the attention.

00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:40.793
You know how that feels, don't you, Tim?

00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.791
It hurts, doesn't it?

00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.995
Yeah. It does.

00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.199
And then what happened?

00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:51.880
Well...

00:50:52.280 --> 00:50:53.633
They fired me!

00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:56.873
And took away my special formula.

00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:59.952
Then they sent me down to live with a...

00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:02.318
- family!
- Oh, Francis, no!

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.152
Baby Corp betrayed me!

00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:07.676
And I'm finally going to get revenge...

00:51:08.680 --> 00:51:10.910
with the Forever Puppy.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.229
- Huh?
- That's it?

00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:13.400
No, no.

00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:15.670
Imagine a puppy that never grows up.

00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:19.555
A puppy that stays a puppy forever.

00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:23.150
Once I launch my Forever Puppies
to every corner of the world...

00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:24.839
they'll be so adorable...

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.319
How cute!

00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:31.196
...no one will ever want a baby
ever, ever again.

00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:34.148
The end of Baby Corp!

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.389
Please.

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.358
A puppy that never grows up?
That's impossible!

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Isn't it?

00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:48.876
It was, until you brought me
the key ingredient.

00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:53.717
My secret formula.

00:51:53.920 --> 00:51:55.672
It's mine! It's mine!

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.677
It's all mine.

00:51:57.880 --> 00:51:58.517
No!

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.389
You brought me the very thing I needed
to destroy Baby Corp.

00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.913
- No!
- Yes!

00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:06.078
You walked right into my trap!

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.216
- You'll never get away with this!
- Yeah, not if we...

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:09.719
What? Tell?

00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.075
Who are you gonna tell, Tim?
Your parents?

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.240
Where are the boys?

00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.078
I told them to stay in the Puppy Zone.

00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.390
I'm taking them both with me
to Las Vegas.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:19.551
So stay out of my way.

00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:23.269
I'd hate for them to get terminated.

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.279
They'd never leave us alone.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:26.475
Oh, really?

00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.874
Wait until they meet
Puppy Co's certified...

00:52:31.080 --> 00:52:34.231
in-house childcare expert.

00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.313
Oh, no.

00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.550
- Don't be nervous, buddy.
- It's only overnight.

00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:46.080
We'll be back before you know it.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:48.310
Besides, you boys are in great hands.

00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:53.114
That's right!

00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.795
Eugenia is practically
perfect in every way.

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:57.756
No.

00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.753
Please don't go with him.
Francis Francis is trying to...

00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.069
Believe me...

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.919
Eugenia won't take her eyes
off your children.

00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:07.150
Not for one second.

00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.992
That's very reassuring.

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:11.431
Now you see them.

00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:14.190
And now, you don't.

00:53:16.440 --> 00:53:17.475
Too-da-loo!

00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.108
To the airport!

00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:35.870
It's over. I'm through.

00:53:36.040 --> 00:53:37.155
What do we do, Templeton?

00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:38.320
What do we do?

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.755
We have to get to the airport
and stop Francis Francis...

00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.353
before the plane takes off!

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:45.318
Yes! But how do we get past
Scary Poppins down there?

00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.357
Okay. There must be something we can do.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.673
Hey, it's not that bad.

00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:00.360
Are you okay?

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.749
What's the matter with you?

00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.999
Don't look at me!

00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.200
Oh, no!

00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.151
Without that formula,
I turn into a normal baby.

00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.959
You know, goo-goo, ga-ga.
The whole bit!

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.120
Oh, no!

00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:19.400
Gross!

00:54:21.880 --> 00:54:24.314
I'm a ticking baby time bomb!

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.917
I'm going to turn into a puking,
pooping, helpless baby!

00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:32.073
Wait a second. That gives me an idea.

00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:33.355
What? What is it?

00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:35.556
I've been through
a lot of babysitters...

00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:37.915
and they all fear one thing.

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:51.997
Now, ladies,
the secret to deep fried butter...

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.720
is a healthy dab of margarine.

00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:57.832
Hey, Mr. Lady Man!

00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.557
The baby. I think he's sick!

00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.718
You gotta do something!

00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.958
Oh, the horror!

00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:17.996
- Templeton!
- Delicious!

00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.719
Gross! It got in your mouth!

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.397
It got in my mouth, too!

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.119
I think I'm gonna be sick!

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:34.880
Swirly!

00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.796
There's only an hour
before the plane takes off.

00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:43.389
Let's take the bike.

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:44.754
The bike?

00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:46.714
I don't know.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:49.036
Let's move!

00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.416
- Okay, but wait right here!
- What?

00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.839
Where are you going? Templeton!

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.399
Always wear a helmet.

00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.398
Too-da-loo, toilet head!

00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:01.588
You'll never catch us!

00:56:18.680 --> 00:56:19.680
Staci!

00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.914
Staci, come in!

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.073
Oh, Staci!

00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:24.958
- Is that you, boss?
- Code red!

00:56:25.120 --> 00:56:27.429
I'm being chased by a killer babysitter!
Gather the team!

00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:28.520
On it, boss.

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:29.876
- Hello!
- Hello!

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.268
- Hello!
- Code red.

00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.440
Got it!

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.834
We got a code red. Repeat...

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.194
We got a code red!

00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.512
What are you doing, Templeton? Go, go!

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.795
But that's jaywalking!

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.080
Here, I'll pay your ticket.

00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.160
Go!

00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.229
I think we lost him!

00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:58.472
Oh, no, we didn't!

00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.959
Flower power!

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:21.913
Pow, pow, pow!

00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:23.360
That's my boy!

00:57:25.160 --> 00:57:26.388
Poppy!

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:37.708
Run, run, run.

00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.276
Uh-oh.

00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:48.913
Run, run, run.

00:58:09.560 --> 00:58:11.152
Tim, you've gotta go faster!

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.639
I can't do it!

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:14.068
You can.

00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:16.310
You've got it in you, Templeton.
Now, eyes ahead.

00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:17.708
I said eyes ahead, son!

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:20.030
Buttocks up! Now pedal like you mean it!

00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:23.237
Either you run the day,
or the day runs you.

00:58:24.920 --> 00:58:25.920
Good!

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.629
Uh-oh!

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:30.109
My training wheels!
I can't ride without training wheels!

00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.397
Whether you think you can
or you think you can't, you're right!

00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:34.709
What are you talking about?

00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:37.440
The path to success
is not a straight line, Templeton...

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.079
but rather a wild ride...

00:58:39.280 --> 00:58:40.280
like a ship at sea.

00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.719
And you're a sea captain...

00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.598
taming a turbulent ocean!

00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.270
I'm a sea captain, taming the ocean!

00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:53.070
Good!

00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:54.912
Tree! I'm gonna hit it!

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.036
Aim for failure,
and you'll always succeed.

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:58.599
- What?
- Aim away from failure!

00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:02.792
I'm doing it. I'm doing it!

00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.871
Once success is a habit...

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.359
then it's all downhill.

00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:08.200
Look!

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.719
There they are!
Mom, Dad!

00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:13.160
- Train!
- Choo-choo!

00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.080
Stop!

00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:18.353
What are you doing?

00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.960
- We're gonna make it.
- But I don't have a quote for this!

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:38.709
You did it!

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:40.836
No! We did it.

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.475
And all without your training wheels.

00:59:50.360 --> 00:59:51.395
Coming through!

00:59:51.560 --> 00:59:52.709
Baby on board!

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:53.995
Hang on to your diaper!

00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:56.799
Duck and cover!

00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.589
Hold it, buddy!

00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.352
I'm gonna need a strip search on two.

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.991
There they are! Mom, Dad!

01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.229
Hey, not so fast!

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:11.440
Oh, no.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.549
Templeton!

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:16.153
- Hey!
- Sorry!

01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:20.555
Hey, where'd you go?

01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:22.670
Oh, no!

01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:23.955
Not again!

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.269
Not now!

01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:27.835
What the...?

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:32.316
No, no, no!

01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:33.635
Come on!

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:35.631
I think I ate $1.75.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.031
Excuse me, coming through! Mom, Dad!

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.915
Hurry now! Move!

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.256
We don't wanna miss our flight!

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.872
- No!
- I warned you!

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:45.720
Wait!

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:48.468
- No!
- No.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.437
Mom, Dad! Stop!

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.400
No!

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.151
No, no, no.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:01.958
They're gone.

01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:04.669
I failed.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.072
I would've gotten to my parents
if I didn't have to go back for you!

01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.595
What? We would have been here
in plenty of time...

01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.680
if you knew how to ride a bike
like a normal kid!

01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:15.956
We're never going to stop the launch
on time.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.236
Who cares? My parents are in danger.

01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.000
I care! Baby Corp is going to go
out of business.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.040
That's all you ever talk about.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:25.634
You don't even know what it's like
to be part of a family.

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.680
And you don't know what it's like
to have a job!

01:01:27.840 --> 01:01:32.311
You don't know anything about hugs,
or bedtime stories, or special songs!

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.948
Oh, please! Stop acting like a baby.

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.120
You're a baby!

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.869
You take that back.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:40.110
My life was perfect until you showed up!

01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.431
Believe me, kid, the feeling is mutual.
I wish I'd never met you!

01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:45.113
I wish you'd never been born!

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.553
Where are you going?

01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:01.040
Fine!

01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:12.830
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:17.833
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:21.235
All your life

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.994
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.676
Would Timothy Templeton please pick up
the white courtesy phone?

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:39.516
Timothy Leslie Templeton,
please pick up the white courtesy phone.

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:41.079
Leslie.

01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.670
Hello?

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.990
It's me. Don't hang up, Tim!

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.549
Tim, I wasn't born. I was hired.

01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:52.994
What do you mean?

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:55.668
Baby Corp is the only home I've ever known.

01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:59.669
So you're right.
I don't know what it's like...

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.199
to be part of a family.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.953
But I do care.

01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.189
You do?

01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.509
Yeah.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.633
And the only way to save both
is to stop Francis Francis.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.630
Yeah.

01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:14.631
I can't do this without you, Tim.

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.119
I need you.

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.033
- I guess we do make a pretty good team.
- No.

01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:23.477
Literally, I can't reach the door knobs.

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:24.868
Oh, right.

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:26.953
Don't worry, Tim.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.792
We're gonna save your parents.

01:03:29.640 --> 01:03:31.232
And your company.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.757
But how do we get to Vegas now?

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:36.070
We're gonna need a miracle.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.594
Follow that Elvis!

01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:48.800
Why?

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:50.998
Where there's Elvis, there's Vegas!

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:52.229
There's another one!

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.389
And another one!

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.228
Elvises everywhere!

01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.671
Tim, there's our flight!

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:01.308
And there goes our ticket!

01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:09.759
Hey! Don't be cruel!

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:11.069
Sorry!

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.079
- Well, thank you!
- Oh, baby!

01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.474
Well, thank you very much.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:15.640
Hello.

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.918
Hi.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.838
Ticket please.

01:04:19.960 --> 01:04:21.279
One moment.

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:24.589
It's been stolen!

01:04:24.800 --> 01:04:27.075
Impersonating an Elvis impersonator?

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:27.791
Get him!

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:28.875
Humina, humina, humina.

01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.280
Stop!

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.269
The ghost of Elvis!

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:36.835
We gotta find seats!

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.115
Come on, this way!

01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:48.634
What is this place?

01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:51.997
This, Templeton, is first class.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.315
Why is it empty?

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.799
No one can afford it.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:58.077
That's what makes it so wonderful.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:00.631
Hello! This is Captain Ross.

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.791
Ladies and gentlemen,
and those in coach...

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.912
please fasten your seat belts.
We're about to take off.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:08.519
What's the matter, Templeton?

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:13.313
My parents always hold my hand
during takeoff.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:23.594
Boy, the stocks are crazy today.

01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:34.077
Ladies and gentlemen,
Captain Ross again.

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:36.336
As you can see,
I've switched off the seat belt sign.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.271
What are you two boys doi ng up here?

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.512
We're Captain Ross's kids.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.033
He told us to sit here.

01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:46.393
Well, can I get you special guys anything?

01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:47.560
Anything?

01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.073
Anything.

01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:52.951
Aye! All right, Francis Francis.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.759
This will teach you
to kidnap the parents of One-Eyed Tim.

01:05:57.040 --> 01:05:59.110
Oh, please. If only it were that easy.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:00.554
What's your plan?

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:02.280
You're not gonna write a memo, are you?

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.560
No.

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.161
Come on. You said you never really
had a childhood, right?

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:08.389
Why don't you give it a try?

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:09.879
- No, I can't.
- It's fun!

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.758
Here, let's get you into character.

01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.399
I don't know. I feel silly!

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.312
Go on! Say something mean to him.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.760
All right, all right, all right.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:22.236
So, you went to a community college, is it?

01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:23.230
I don't know.

01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:24.230
Keep going!

01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:27.995
And you have the guts
to ask me for a bonus, now?

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:29.550
See!

01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:31.119
Now you're getting into it.

01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:32.280
Huh?

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.231
Well, blow me down.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.550
Your exit interview is over!

01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:40.155
That was pretty good.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:41.600
Who was that guy anyway?

01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.318
- The captain!
- What?

01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:46.320
En garde!

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Heave!

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.640
Ho!

01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.675
Thar she blows!

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.599
Watch your stern!

01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.000
- Aye!
- Dodge, parry, and thrust!

01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:13.513
Sounds like a heck of a law firm!

01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:15.636
Nice try!
Heads up!

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.792
You're fired!

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.428
And here's your severance package. Ha!

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:23.108
Wait. You're not supposed to end with "Ha!"

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:24.280
You're not?

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:26.791
You're supposed to end with "Argh!"

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.313
Got it! Argh!

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:31.560
That's great!

01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.477
Thanks! I just went with the flow.

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.710
Ladies and gentlemen,
and those in coach...

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:37.313
on the left side of the plane...

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:40.950
you can see we're approaching
fabulous Las Vegas.

01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:46.869
Land ho!

01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.479
Ahoy, matey.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.520
Bye, Dad! Thanks for the lift!

01:07:58.720 --> 01:08:00.153
- Okay. What?
- Let's move.

01:08:00.320 --> 01:08:02.496
- Going to the Heartbreak Hotel?
- I'm going to the Heartbreak Hotel.

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.520
- Me, too!
- Me, too!

01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.600
Me, too!

01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:10.598
We've gotta get to the convention center.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.034
Should we get a taxi?

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:15.431
Darn! I spent all my per diem.
That's more our speed.

01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:19.880
Right.

01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.871
Excuse me, ladies.

01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.839
Can we get a ride home?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:28.515
Jimmy's been sick,
and he needs his expensive medicine.

01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.273
Where do you live, sweetie?

01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.954
The convention center.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:41.433
Bye, sweetie!

01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:43.033
Have a fun lady party!

01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.633
Chicks dig babies.

01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:48.273
The people of Long Island do not know
how to make an iced tea.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.031
Oh, no! How are we gonna find my parents
in here?

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:53.950
Tim!

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:55.120
Over there.

01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.879
Okay, now where's Puppy Co?

01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:59.031
Puppy Co, Puppy Co, Puppy Co...

01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.952
Aha! Here it is. Found it!

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:05.628
But how did you...?

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:08.071
Hey! Where'd you go?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Not again!

01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.237
Come on! I need you!

01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.314
I'm back! I'm back.

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:21.914
What's going on?

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:23.080
That's right.

01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:27.119
We're gonna launch a brand new puppy
in every continent.

01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:28.952
In every country!

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:33.796
We're going to take over the world,
one heart at a time.

01:09:36.680 --> 01:09:38.750
- Tim, there they are!
- Mom, Dad!

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.070
Imagine a puppy that never grows up...

01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.157
never gets old.

01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:47.992
A puppy that stays a puppy forever.

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:52.434
I give you the only thing
you'll ever love...

01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:55.034
the Forever Puppy!

01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:01.120
Mommy?

01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.119
Avert your eyes, Templeton!

01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.359
Hey! What are you doing here?

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:11.436
Mom, Dad!

01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:12.959
What are they doing here?

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.792
What are Tim and the baby doing here?

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.269
What are any of us doing here, really?

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.198
What is going on here?

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.720
He's got my parents!

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.631
We're really here to get them.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.550
Get them!

01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:25.995
Get the Forever Puppy!

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:28.548
We've got to get backstage.

01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:32.629
In there!

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.320
Run!

01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:40.673
Go, go, go!

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.514
Left, right! Left, right! Left, right!

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:50.680
Yes!

01:10:54.760 --> 01:10:56.830
Fart. Poop. Doodie.

01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:00.069
Look at all that formula.

01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.991
Now that's how you launch a product.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.200
Oh, no!

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:11.512
He's putting them under the rocket!

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.875
Elvis has left the building!

01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:31.559
Mom, Dad...

01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:32.760
I'm coming!

01:11:32.880 --> 01:11:34.916
Atta boy! Go, Tim! Go, go!

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:40.189
Launch initiated.

01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:44.439
I'm launching my Forever Puppies,
and there's nothing you can do about it!

01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.760
No!

01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:49.480
Baby Corp stole all the love from me...

01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:51.790
and now I'm going to
take it back from them.

01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:53.760
You should understand
what I'm talking about.

01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:56.992
You got replaced just like me!

01:11:57.160 --> 01:11:58.718
No! I'm nothing like you!

01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880
Bratty kid!

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.594
Let our parents go!
His parents. The parents.

01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:03.760
Yeah!

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:06.280
You could have had your parents' love
all to yourself again!

01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:07.230
But no!

01:12:07.400 --> 01:12:08.400
You blew it!

01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.796
You let that baby boss you around.

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:11.995
He doesn't work for me.

01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.559
We're partners!

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:16.273
I'm not ticklish.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.154
Hey! Where's the baby?

01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:19.753
Everyone has a tickle spot!

01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.670
My ears!

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:22.159
Stop it!

01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:24.988
Little brats!

01:12:31.600 --> 01:12:34.990
Nothing is going to get in the way
of my vengeance.

01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.952
Not you, not anybody!

01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.639
Baby Corp is through.

01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:40.279
I win! Ha!

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.440
Wrong!

01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.197
You're not supposed to end with "Ha!"

01:12:45.440 --> 01:12:47.271
- That's right!
- What?

01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:49.112
You're supposed to end with...

01:12:49.280 --> 01:12:50.429
Argh!

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.315
En garde!

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.630
You're fired!

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.791
And here's your severance package!

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.632
Take that, you scurvy scallywag!

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.516
Argh!

01:13:06.680 --> 01:13:08.477
One minute and counting.

01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.314
- Help!
- Anybody!

01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.073
Tim! What are you doing?

01:13:18.840 --> 01:13:19.840
No!

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.713
Mom, Dad, I'm coming!

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.995
Is that you?

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:25.231
Don't worry, Mom and Dad. I got this!

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.960
- Are you okay?
- Is the baby all right?

01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040
Yes, the baby's fine.

01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:29.309
Who was that?

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:30.993
That was me!

01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:32.229
The baby's fine.

01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.154
It won't budge!

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:36.469
What's happening?

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:37.720
Wait a second!

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:39.149
Hey.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.673
I know a way to move my parents.

01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:42.080
- How?
- We can use the puppies!

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:43.600
Upsies.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.149
I need upsies.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.753
But what if you "go baby" again?

01:13:46.920 --> 01:13:48.990
It'll be fine.
Fine, fine.

01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.160
Fine!

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.553
It'll be fine.

01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:53.153
Hang on to your diaper!

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.029
We're moving!

01:14:05.200 --> 01:14:06.428
Why are we moving?

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:08.033
All right, Mom and Dad, hang on!

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.191
T-minus 30 seconds.

01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:12.793
Oh, no! Wait!

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.435
Hold on!

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:15.874
Go, Tim! Get your parents...

01:14:16.360 --> 01:14:17.509
out of here.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:19.914
You've gotta jump!

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.072
Come on, it's a piece of cake!

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.190
No! No patty cake! Get down!

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:29.711
Don't cry. I'm sorry.
Please don't cry!

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.629
20 seconds.

01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.557
15 seconds.

01:14:45.080 --> 01:14:48.914
Blackbird singing in the dead of night

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:54.154
Take these broken wings and learn to fly

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.117
All your life

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.275
You were only waiting
For this moment to arise

01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:06.949
- Three...
- Gotcha!

01:15:07.120 --> 01:15:09.031
...two, one.

01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.235
Blast off!

01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.280
Y eah!

01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.071
Hey, are you still in there?

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:30.760
Aha!

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:36.239
What happened? Did we win?

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.230
- We won!
- We won?

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:40.119
- We won, we won, we won!
- We won! Yes!

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:42.795
Victory nap!

01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:48.549
You ruined everything!

01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:53.031
It's not fair! It's not fair!

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.235
That's not right.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.712
Now you're really going to pay!

01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.838
Oh, yeah? It's time you pick on someone
your own size!

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840
What?

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:06.437
Eugene! You put me down!

01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:08.431
You hear me? I am the boss of you!

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:18.800
This time, we'll raise him right.

01:16:22.760 --> 01:16:25.069
I'm sure that's gonna turn out fine.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.828
Tim, what's happening?

01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:28.592
Mom, Dad, hold on!

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:30.995
Yes!

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.834
- Tim?
- Tim!

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:34.513
Tim! Are you okay?

01:16:34.680 --> 01:16:35.749
I'm fine. We're fine.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.920
You saved us.

01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.354
You're our hero.

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.919
And a great big brother.

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:43.156
We love you both so much.

01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:44.435
Both of us?

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.238
With all our heart.

01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.118
Let's go home.

01:16:59.880 --> 01:17:01.359
How do I look?

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.999
You look great.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:16.391
Well, team, good job.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:19.996
Staci, this letter should get you
into the school of your choice.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.357
- Kindergarten?
- That's right.

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.873
And if there's anything else...

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.040
How about a raise?

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.394
Staci, you don't get paid.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.936
- One million ziggity-five!
- Eight!

01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.960
- A tricycle!
- Skates!

01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:31.796
- Candy corn?
- Lollipop!

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.000
Deal.

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:36.518
Best boss ever.

01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:39.319
And you guys don't always have to
toe the company line, you know?

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.760
It's okay to think for yourself.

01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.750
- No, sir!
- No way!

01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:43.035
That's a terrible idea!

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.553
That's the attitude.

01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.976
- You're so right!
- You've got it, sir!

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.200
- You're the man!
- Absolutely!

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:49.908
Here you go, big guy.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.234
You've earned it.

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:57.593
You wanna hug me, don't you?

01:18:01.160 --> 01:18:03.355
I'll miss you too, buddy. Okay.

01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:08.590
- There, there.
- It'll be okay, big guy.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.080
So...

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:12.440
you did it.

01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.750
No. We did it.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.671
By the way,
congratulations on your promotion.

01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:22.668
The corner office, the private potty.
All that stuff.

01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.359
But, hey! How about you?

01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:26.590
You have your parents all to yourself.

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.438
So what am I gonna tell Mom and Dad
after you leave?

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:34.640
Don't worry.

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:37.234
Baby Corp has a procedure
for situations like this.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.273
It'll be like I was never born.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.754
I almost forgot!

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.117
No way! Lam-Lam!

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.799
- You fixed her.
- Yep.

01:18:48.960 --> 01:18:51.315
She's as good as new.
She's a tough one.

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.314
Well, I guess we both got what we wanted.

01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.959
It's a win-win.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.115
Probably should...

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.280
Yeah.

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:14.400
So, stay in school.

01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:16.636
I don't really have a choice.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:17.800
Yeah, right.

01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:20.991
- Goodbye, Tim.
- Bye.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:37.118
Yeah, right.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:07.831
He left as suddenly as he arrived.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:09.070
Bye.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:12.477
Finally, my life was perfect again.

01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:22.476
Forget about the baby.

01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.160
Oopsies!

01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:39.508
Pardon me, big fella.

01:20:59.360 --> 01:21:01.794
Surprise!

01:21:07.280 --> 01:21:08.952
Hooray!

01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:41.474
Forget about the baby?

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:44.438
No, thanks. I'm good.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.114
Okie-dokie.

01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:22.909
Argh.

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.559
Dear Boss Baby...

01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:40.551
I don't usually write very much...

01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:43.757
but now I know
that memos are very important things.

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:46.195
Even though I never went
to business school...

01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:48.555
I did learn to share in kindergarten.

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:51.439
And if there isn't enough love
for the two of us...

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.955
then I wanna give you all of mine.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.392
I would like to offer you a job.

01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.675
It will be hard work...

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:28.876
and there will be no pay.

01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:32.717
But the good news is that
you can never be fired.

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.958
And I promise you this.

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.119
Every morning when you wake up,
I will be there.

01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:41.589
Every night at dinner, I will be there.

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:44.268
Every birthday party,
every Christmas morning...

01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.634
I will be there.

01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:50.754
Year after year after year.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.676
We will grow old together.

01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:02.235
And you and I will always...

01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.080
...be brothers.

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:05.680
Always.

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:29.637
Wake up, little halflings!
It's 7:00 a m.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.992
What's the poi nt, Wizzie?

01:25:34.160 --> 01:25:36.435
Because it's 7:00 a.m.

01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:39.319
I have one job to do,
and you make it so difficult.

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.512
It's okay, little halfling.

01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:47.511
Sometimes, I get confused too.

01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:50.240
Especially during daylight savings time.

01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:52.197
Spring forward, fall back.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.555
We don't even have calendars
in the wizard's realm!

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:58.269
There is no spring,
only darkness and winter!

01:25:58.440 --> 01:26:00.715
I'm not confused at all, Wizzie.

01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:01.989
I just miss him.

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.632
Tim, look who's here!

01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:19.958
It's your new baby...

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:21.189
Brother!

01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:23.479
You're here! You're really here!

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.789
Gentle, gentle.

01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.951
You came back!

01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.871
Say hello to Theodore Lindsey Templeton.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:32.360
Lindsey?

01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.111
Who's ticklish? Who's ticklish?

01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.474
Here you go.

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:44.755
So, that's my story.

01:26:46.440 --> 01:26:47.668
Our story.

01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:52.189
Luckily for me and my little brother,
it had a happy ending.

01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:56.236
Is that a true story, Daddy?

01:26:56.440 --> 01:26:58.635
Well, sweetie, that's how I remember it.

01:26:58.800 --> 01:27:00.552
- But you know what I found out?
- What?

01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:02.950
There's plenty of love for everyone.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.120
Even me?

01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.713
Especially you.

01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:07.279
Just ask your Uncle Ted.

01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:09.749
Hey, kid, I hear you're gonna have
a baby sister.

01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.194
I wanted a horse.

01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:13.920
Here you go, kid.
Go get yourself a horse.

01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.873
You know, I'm proud of you, Leslie.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.672
Back at ya, Lindsey.

01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.031
Hi there, baby sister.

01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:25.630
Argh!

01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:26.994
All right, guys.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:28.195
Time for bed.

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:30.470
Come on, Mom.
Just a little longer.

01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.914
Okay.

01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:13.636
Wake up, little halflings!
It's time to leave.

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:17.190
Go and live your peasant lives.

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.719
Be gone with you!
