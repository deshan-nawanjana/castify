WEBVTT

00:00:41.918 --> 00:00:44.003
Oh, great and mighty Rapu,

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.091
we pray to you for water and sustenance.

00:00:49.592 --> 00:00:53.596
I pray to you, not for me,
but for my daughter.

00:01:30.842 --> 00:01:32.343
I'm tired.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.595
<i>You have suffered.</i>

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:18.264
<i>Come to me.</i>

00:02:19.432 --> 00:02:21.392
<i>Come to me.</i>

00:02:26.856 --> 00:02:29.192
<i>You have suffered.</i>

00:02:33.571 --> 00:02:35.281
<i>Come to me.</i>

00:02:45.792 --> 00:02:48.878
<i>You have suffered.</i>

00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:32.505
Ah! What do we have here?

00:03:34.757 --> 00:03:35.758
Look at it.

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:37.635
It's gobbling up all my fruit.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:42.473
Rapu.

00:03:46.185 --> 00:03:47.228
Bringer of Light.

00:03:47.312 --> 00:03:48.646
Oh, it's one of mine.

00:03:50.732 --> 00:03:53.484
I am Gorr, the last of your disciples.

00:03:53.568 --> 00:03:56.613
We have lost everything, my lord.

00:03:56.779 --> 00:03:58.406
The land is dry.

00:03:58.573 --> 00:04:00.742
All life is lost.

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.994
But our faith in you never wavered

00:04:03.077 --> 00:04:05.163
and now we await the promise

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:08.708
of the eternal reward.

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.085
Is this why you celebrate?

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:15.465
He... He thinks there's an eternal reward.

00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:21.471
No. No, sorry.

00:04:21.554 --> 00:04:23.848
There's no eternal reward for you, dog!

00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:28.436
What we're celebrating is a fresh kill.

00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:31.522
We just vanquished the holder
of the Necrosword...

00:04:31.606 --> 00:04:33.066
<i>- You have suffered.</i>
- ...before he could harm

00:04:33.149 --> 00:04:34.734
any other gods with that cursed blade.

00:04:34.817 --> 00:04:36.235
<i>If it's revenge you seek.</i>

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:38.071
He threatened to end my entire empire.

00:04:38.655 --> 00:04:40.239
But, my lord,

00:04:40.907 --> 00:04:43.326
your empire has already ended.

00:04:44.285 --> 00:04:45.828
There's no one left to worship you.

00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:48.498
There'll be
more followers to replace you.

00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:49.791
There always are.

00:04:49.874 --> 00:04:51.751
We have suffered...

00:04:53.211 --> 00:04:55.046
and we have starved.

00:04:57.924 --> 00:04:59.884
My daughter died...

00:05:01.928 --> 00:05:03.721
- in your name.
- And well you should.

00:05:03.805 --> 00:05:06.849
Suffering for your gods
is your only purpose.

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:09.227
There's nothing for you after death.

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:10.770
Except death.

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:14.315
You are no god.

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:22.490
I renounce you.

00:05:29.706 --> 00:05:32.709
Now your meaningless life
finally does have a purpose.

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:36.379
To sacrifice yourself to me.

00:05:39.048 --> 00:05:41.884
<i>If it's revenge you seek...</i>

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:44.053
..<i>. kill all the gods.</i>

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:46.097
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

00:05:46.264 --> 00:05:49.225
<i>If it's revenge you seek...</i>

00:05:51.394 --> 00:05:52.186
<i>summon the Bifrost.</i>

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.771
<i>Go to Eternity.</i>

00:05:53.855 --> 00:05:55.606
<i>Kill all the gods.</i>

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:56.983
<i>Summon the Bifrost.</i>

00:05:57.066 --> 00:05:59.235
<i>- Go to Eternity.</i>
<i>- Kill all the gods.</i>

00:05:59.318 --> 00:06:01.571
<i>Kill all the gods. Kill all the gods.</i>

00:06:15.168 --> 00:06:16.753
The sword chose you.

00:06:17.628 --> 00:06:19.589
You are now cursed!

00:06:19.756 --> 00:06:20.840
Funny.

00:06:21.007 --> 00:06:23.092
It doesn't feel like a curse.

00:06:26.763 --> 00:06:28.306
Feels like a promise.

00:06:30.058 --> 00:06:31.392
So, this is my vow.

00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:36.481
All gods will die.

00:07:21.984 --> 00:07:24.320
Come, come, gather round.

00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:27.698
And listen to the legend
of the Space Viking.

00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:33.579
AKA the God of Thunder.
AKA Thor Odinson.

00:07:40.211 --> 00:07:42.213
<i>Raised in the way of the warrior,</i>

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.799
<i>Thor was taught to help win battles,</i>

00:07:44.966 --> 00:07:46.425
<i>fighting the good fight</i>

00:07:46.509 --> 00:07:48.302
<i>for those who can't fight good.</i>

00:07:50.388 --> 00:07:54.433
<i>He grew and he grew and he grew.</i>

00:07:55.226 --> 00:07:57.311
<i>He was sensitive, like a smile.</i>

00:07:57.395 --> 00:08:00.773
<i>And his loving nature</i>
<i>did not discriminate.</i>

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:03.985
<i>He once loved</i>
<i>a swashbuckling Passionista.</i>

00:08:04.068 --> 00:08:06.988
<i>Another time, he loved a Wolf Woman</i>

00:08:07.071 --> 00:08:08.573
<i>on a Woman Wolf.</i>

00:08:10.616 --> 00:08:13.494
<i>But Thor's one true love</i>
<i>was an Earth woman</i>

00:08:13.578 --> 00:08:15.246
<i>named Jane Fonda.</i>

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:17.790
<i>Oh, wait. No. Jane Foster.</i>

00:08:17.874 --> 00:08:21.627
<i>But sadly, in the battle</i>
<i>for love, Thor lost.</i>

00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:22.503
<i>Ooh.</i>

00:08:23.462 --> 00:08:26.424
<i>In fact, he lost a lot</i>
<i>of people in those days.</i>

00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:27.675
<i>His mum.</i>

00:08:27.758 --> 00:08:29.468
<i>His dad.</i>

00:08:29.552 --> 00:08:30.386
<i>And that guy.</i>

00:08:30.469 --> 00:08:31.637
<i>And that guy.</i>

00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:33.055
<i>And whoever that is.</i>

00:08:33.139 --> 00:08:34.265
<i>And Heimdall.</i>

00:08:34.432 --> 00:08:36.184
<i>And his brother.</i>

00:08:36.267 --> 00:08:37.935
<i>And his brother, again.</i>

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:39.020
<i>And again.</i>

00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.274
<i>Poor Thor had to watch</i>
<i>his planet explode.</i>

00:08:43.983 --> 00:08:46.194
<i>And then he said, "What have I done?"</i>

00:08:46.944 --> 00:08:48.237
<i>It seemed that everything</i>

00:08:48.321 --> 00:08:50.239
<i>and everyone he loved, he lost.</i>

00:08:50.406 --> 00:08:53.284
<i>And so he hid his heart</i>
<i>behind a big, fleshy bod,</i>

00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:55.870
<i>so it could never be broken again.</i>

00:08:56.412 --> 00:08:58.247
<i>But just because he was done loving,</i>

00:08:58.331 --> 00:08:59.957
<i>didn't mean he was done fighting.</i>

00:09:00.875 --> 00:09:03.711
<i>He teamed up with</i>
<i>the Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

00:09:03.878 --> 00:09:06.297
<i>and set off on some</i>
<i>classic Thor adventures.</i>

00:09:06.923 --> 00:09:08.716
<i>He got in shape.</i>

00:09:08.799 --> 00:09:10.301
<i>Putting in the hard yards.</i>

00:09:10.468 --> 00:09:14.472
<i>Turning pains into gains,</i>
<i>and never skipping leg day.</i>

00:09:15.932 --> 00:09:18.893
<i>He went from Dad Bod to God Bod.</i>

00:09:18.976 --> 00:09:22.271
<i>But beneath his God Bod,</i>
<i>there was still a Sad Bod</i>

00:09:22.355 --> 00:09:23.522
<i>just trying to get out.</i>

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:27.276
<i>Because all of the bods</i>

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.445
<i>that Thor had worn over the years</i>

00:09:29.612 --> 00:09:30.738
<i>couldn't hide the pain</i>

00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:32.698
<i>that he was feeling on the inside.</i>

00:09:34.575 --> 00:09:36.452
<i>So he gave up his search for love,</i>

00:09:37.453 --> 00:09:40.331
<i>accepting that he was</i>
<i>only good for one thing...</i>

00:09:41.582 --> 00:09:44.752
<i>Waiting in quiet contemplation</i>
<i>for someone to say,</i>

00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:48.506
<i>"Thor, we need your help</i>
<i>to win this battle."</i>

00:09:49.924 --> 00:09:51.300
Thor.

00:09:51.384 --> 00:09:53.344
We need your help to win this battle.

00:09:53.427 --> 00:09:54.720
Let's go.

00:09:54.804 --> 00:09:56.889
Okay. Come on, Stormbreaker.

00:09:56.973 --> 00:09:58.975
Back to work.

00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:01.602
We must hurry, okay?

00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:04.063
People are dying.

00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:05.273
See you down there.

00:10:09.694 --> 00:10:10.820
Hurry up!

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:24.000
Give me those. You're gonna break 'em.

00:10:24.083 --> 00:10:26.377
I am Groot!

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:28.129
Ah, you got sap all over it.

00:10:30.631 --> 00:10:31.882
Hello, everybody.

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:33.718
Well, well, look who it is.

00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:35.261
How are we doing, guys?

00:10:35.344 --> 00:10:36.554
Terrible!

00:10:37.346 --> 00:10:38.639
We're all about to die.

00:10:38.806 --> 00:10:41.183
You said this planet
would be a relaxing holiday.

00:10:41.267 --> 00:10:44.228
I said it was going to be,
"Like a relaxing holiday."

00:10:44.312 --> 00:10:46.105
But look at that resplendent skyscape.

00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.523
Three suns of Saturn.

00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.150
What could be more relaxing than that?

00:10:49.233 --> 00:10:51.319
An actual holiday!

00:10:51.402 --> 00:10:53.571
Die, Booskan scum!

00:10:56.365 --> 00:10:57.658
God of Thunder.

00:10:57.742 --> 00:10:59.201
King Yakan.

00:10:59.285 --> 00:11:01.787
You have finally joined our fight.

00:11:01.871 --> 00:11:03.080
Well, as they say,

00:11:03.164 --> 00:11:04.582
"Better late than not at all."

00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:06.375
Yes, it's very nice.

00:11:06.542 --> 00:11:09.587
As you know, we used to live
in a peaceful oasis.

00:11:09.754 --> 00:11:11.672
But then our gods were murdered.

00:11:11.756 --> 00:11:12.715
Murdered?

00:11:12.798 --> 00:11:15.926
And now our sacred temple
has been left unguarded,

00:11:16.010 --> 00:11:18.721
and Habooska's hordes
took control of its power.

00:11:18.804 --> 00:11:22.350
It is our most sacred shrine
and he desecrates it.

00:11:22.433 --> 00:11:23.434
Not for long.

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:25.686
Ah!

00:11:25.770 --> 00:11:29.065
King Yakan, tell them
what happened here today.

00:11:29.607 --> 00:11:31.567
Tell of the time that Thor,

00:11:32.068 --> 00:11:36.405
and his ragtag, motley crew
of misfit desperados,

00:11:36.489 --> 00:11:38.532
turned the tide of the battle,

00:11:38.616 --> 00:11:40.785
and etched their names in history.

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:42.745
For the odds may be against us,

00:11:42.828 --> 00:11:44.163
but I'll tell you this for free...

00:11:44.246 --> 00:11:45.331
Here it comes.

00:11:45.414 --> 00:11:48.918
This ends here and now!

00:11:52.338 --> 00:11:53.923
Oh!

00:13:43.699 --> 00:13:46.285
He's not going to go
into the temple, is he? No.

00:13:49.497 --> 00:13:50.664
Oh.

00:13:57.922 --> 00:13:59.340
Well done, everybody.

00:13:59.507 --> 00:14:01.217
We can collectively take credit for that

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:02.676
because we worked as a team.

00:14:03.552 --> 00:14:04.929
We used our hearts and our minds

00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:06.347
to defeat the enemy

00:14:06.514 --> 00:14:08.307
with minimal loss or damage.

00:14:16.023 --> 00:14:17.942
What a classic Thor adventure!

00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:19.360
Hurrah!

00:14:42.967 --> 00:14:44.385
Good book?

00:14:44.552 --> 00:14:45.594
Yeah.

00:14:46.262 --> 00:14:47.429
I wrote it.

00:14:48.472 --> 00:14:51.058
Wait. You're Dr Jane Foster?

00:14:51.225 --> 00:14:52.393
I am.

00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:54.228
- Uh... Hi.
- Hi.

00:14:54.311 --> 00:14:55.896
How's the, uh, Einstein-Rosen Bridge?

00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.481
It's tough.

00:14:57.648 --> 00:14:58.941
- Yeah.
- Really tough.

00:14:59.024 --> 00:15:00.776
It's... You need a 3D model.

00:15:00.943 --> 00:15:02.361
You ever see <i>Event Horizon?</i>

00:15:02.444 --> 00:15:03.821
No.

00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:06.240
<i>- Interstellar?</i>
- No.

00:15:06.407 --> 00:15:08.200
That movie explains everything
really clearly.

00:15:08.284 --> 00:15:10.703
Um, all right. The Einstein-Rosen Bridge

00:15:10.786 --> 00:15:14.498
folds space, so that point A and point B

00:15:15.457 --> 00:15:17.418
coexist in space and time.

00:15:18.085 --> 00:15:19.086
Like that.

00:15:20.963 --> 00:15:22.256
You just ruined your own book.

00:15:22.339 --> 00:15:24.091
Yeah, but now you understand wormholes.

00:15:26.719 --> 00:15:27.845
Watch those movies.

00:15:27.928 --> 00:15:29.471
- Okay.
- Okay.

00:15:29.555 --> 00:15:31.807
Saw the Hot Cheetos, had to get it.

00:15:38.772 --> 00:15:41.025
So, how's, uh... how's it going?

00:15:41.108 --> 00:15:44.445
It's going amazing.

00:15:49.116 --> 00:15:52.494
Have you told anyone else besides me?

00:15:53.162 --> 00:15:55.414
When people find out,
they start acting weird.

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:57.499
They're just different.

00:15:58.334 --> 00:16:00.127
I don't need that in my life right now.

00:16:00.294 --> 00:16:01.879
Anyway, it's not that serious.

00:16:01.962 --> 00:16:03.672
Jane, it's Stage Four.

00:16:03.756 --> 00:16:05.883
Out of, like, how many stages?

00:16:06.675 --> 00:16:07.635
Four.

00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:08.969
That we know about.

00:16:13.223 --> 00:16:15.643
Oh, you have somewhere else
you gotta be right now

00:16:15.726 --> 00:16:17.394
that's more important than chemo?

00:16:17.478 --> 00:16:18.854
No.

00:16:26.487 --> 00:16:28.072
You're trying to get back
to the lab, aren't you?

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:29.865
I have a few ideas I'm trying.

00:16:29.948 --> 00:16:31.867
Okay, no, time out.

00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:34.870
I know you think your lab work
is something you have to do,

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:37.623
otherwise you're letting down
all of civilisation,

00:16:38.791 --> 00:16:40.334
but you're not getting what the universe

00:16:40.417 --> 00:16:42.044
is actually trying to tell you,

00:16:42.127 --> 00:16:43.504
so let me translate.

00:16:44.046 --> 00:16:46.090
Slow down.

00:16:46.256 --> 00:16:48.217
You need your energy
to fight this thing.

00:16:49.635 --> 00:16:51.970
I'll fight it my way, okay?

00:16:52.054 --> 00:16:53.347
Well, FYI,

00:16:53.514 --> 00:16:57.184
"my way" does not have
to equal "alone in a lab."

00:16:59.603 --> 00:17:02.147
Maybe it's time to play
the Space Viking card.

00:17:02.231 --> 00:17:04.358
- It's not a card.
- Yes, it is.

00:17:04.441 --> 00:17:05.901
- There's no card.
- There's a card.

00:17:05.984 --> 00:17:08.445
It's tall, it's blond,
and it's gorgeous.

00:17:08.529 --> 00:17:09.988
It's a handsome card.

00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:12.032
- Jane, are you sure?
- Look, Darcy...

00:17:12.116 --> 00:17:15.244
I will figure this out by myself.

00:17:22.584 --> 00:17:25.921
<i>Results are</i>
<i>still coming back the same.</i>

00:17:26.505 --> 00:17:28.424
<i>I'm afraid the chemo</i>
<i>has very little effect.</i>

00:17:30.759 --> 00:17:32.219
<i>I'm so sorry, Jane.</i>

00:17:33.595 --> 00:17:34.805
<i>If there's anything I can do,</i>

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:36.807
<i>or if you just wanna talk, call me.</i>

00:18:31.528 --> 00:18:34.615
Smell like a king,
because you're worthy.

00:18:34.948 --> 00:18:36.158
Old Spice.

00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:40.078
Cut!

00:19:07.189 --> 00:19:09.691
Look at this place.
It's beautiful.

00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:11.026
Home.

00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:12.361
Yes, home, Father.

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:14.530
We're here to take you home.

00:19:14.613 --> 00:19:17.407
Yes. To planet Asgard.

00:19:17.491 --> 00:19:19.952
Asgard is not a planet, my sons.

00:19:20.035 --> 00:19:22.496
It is people. It is you!

00:19:22.579 --> 00:19:24.873
And now, it is time

00:19:24.957 --> 00:19:27.584
for me to pass on to the spirit realm.

00:19:30.295 --> 00:19:32.047
I will take my place

00:19:32.214 --> 00:19:35.092
in the great banqueting hall
of Valhalla,

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:37.678
the resting place of the gods.

00:19:37.761 --> 00:19:39.721
Oh, one more thing.

00:19:40.639 --> 00:19:41.849
You have a sister.

00:19:42.850 --> 00:19:47.145
And so now, I turn into godly stardust,

00:19:47.229 --> 00:19:48.981
and say farewell.

00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:50.691
Oh, look.

00:19:51.316 --> 00:19:53.193
Do you see? It's happening.

00:19:54.152 --> 00:19:55.612
I'm disappearing.

00:20:00.117 --> 00:20:01.702
No!

00:20:01.785 --> 00:20:02.786
Father!

00:20:04.997 --> 00:20:06.415
But wait! Brother!

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:11.044
An ominous portal
hath appeared behind us.

00:20:11.628 --> 00:20:12.754
Transform!

00:20:22.598 --> 00:20:25.350
I am Hela, Goddess of Death.

00:20:25.434 --> 00:20:27.561
Now, I return to Asgard

00:20:27.644 --> 00:20:30.480
to stake my claim
as the rightful heir to the throne,

00:20:30.564 --> 00:20:32.399
and no one will stop me!

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.442
Join me or die!

00:20:33.525 --> 00:20:34.860
We will never join you, witch!

00:20:34.943 --> 00:20:35.903
Mjolnir!

00:20:40.824 --> 00:20:42.075
Impossible!

00:20:43.619 --> 00:20:45.454
I broke your hammer!

00:20:45.537 --> 00:20:47.080
Time to die!

00:20:47.247 --> 00:20:48.540
Bifrost!

00:21:00.385 --> 00:21:02.846
You can almost feel the power

00:21:03.013 --> 00:21:05.766
of these magnificent
and immovable stones.

00:21:06.308 --> 00:21:08.685
Okay. Let's head back to the village

00:21:08.852 --> 00:21:11.855
where we can drink
some real Asgardian mead.

00:21:11.939 --> 00:21:13.482
Come on.

00:21:48.433 --> 00:21:50.060
God of Disaster,

00:21:51.228 --> 00:21:52.437
we thank you.

00:21:52.521 --> 00:21:54.481
We feared we would be at war forever

00:21:54.564 --> 00:21:56.358
without the protection of our gods,

00:21:56.525 --> 00:21:59.486
but now, peace shall reign.

00:22:00.028 --> 00:22:03.448
In return for your service,
please accept these gifts.

00:22:04.783 --> 00:22:07.327
As is tradition,
the protectors of our world

00:22:07.411 --> 00:22:09.496
are bestowed with great beasts.

00:22:12.082 --> 00:22:13.125
Giant goats!

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:15.210
Oh, look at those! They are wonderful.

00:22:15.293 --> 00:22:18.171
Korg, look at that.
Those things are beautiful.

00:22:18.255 --> 00:22:20.716
King Yakan, thank you so much.

00:22:20.799 --> 00:22:22.634
Listen, um, about the temple...

00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:23.844
I don't wanna talk about the temple.

00:22:23.927 --> 00:22:25.012
I know, but if we were to talk about it,

00:22:25.095 --> 00:22:26.346
- I think it's important...
- It's making me sad.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:27.431
...to life and material objects...

00:22:27.514 --> 00:22:28.807
- And mad.
- Okay, I'll stop talking.

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:30.600
Don't forget the goats.

00:22:30.684 --> 00:22:33.061
Which you accepted,
and now must take with you.

00:22:33.145 --> 00:22:34.354
No backsies.

00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:38.233
- Aw. They are beautiful.
- Yes, they are beautiful.

00:22:39.401 --> 00:22:40.944
They also scream quite a lot.

00:22:41.028 --> 00:22:41.987
They'll be fine.

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.072
I am Groot.

00:22:44.156 --> 00:22:45.198
We need to find the damn remote

00:22:45.282 --> 00:22:46.950
so we can download the distress signal!

00:22:47.034 --> 00:22:49.077
Retrace your steps.
Where did you put the remote?

00:22:49.161 --> 00:22:50.495
One of your goats probably ate it!

00:22:50.579 --> 00:22:52.330
Goats didn't eat the remote.
Don't be ridiculous.

00:22:52.414 --> 00:22:53.832
Well, I ain't digging through
their crap.

00:22:53.915 --> 00:22:55.625
I love them!

00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:56.710
They should live with us forever!

00:22:56.793 --> 00:22:57.919
Found the remote!

00:22:58.086 --> 00:22:59.129
I'm putting them down.

00:22:59.212 --> 00:23:00.297
- Me too.
- Is it working or not?

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:01.673
No, it's not workin'. It's not charged.

00:23:01.757 --> 00:23:02.758
Well, maybe you need to find a charger...

00:23:02.841 --> 00:23:03.884
Get out of my way!

00:23:03.967 --> 00:23:05.177
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa!

00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:07.012
Whew.

00:23:07.095 --> 00:23:08.889
- Korg, you okay?
- Yeah, bro. All good.

00:23:08.972 --> 00:23:10.182
All right. Everybody, just relax.

00:23:10.265 --> 00:23:11.433
The goats are gonna be fine.

00:23:11.516 --> 00:23:13.185
If not, we can just use them for meat...

00:23:15.103 --> 00:23:16.730
...ting people. Meeting people.

00:23:16.813 --> 00:23:18.231
They're a great conversation starter.

00:23:18.315 --> 00:23:20.776
And I've been told you can summon them
with a special whistle

00:23:20.859 --> 00:23:22.444
that goes something like this...

00:23:22.527 --> 00:23:24.321
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

00:23:24.404 --> 00:23:25.822
No, that's not it. You have a go.

00:23:25.906 --> 00:23:27.324
No, that's not it.

00:23:27.407 --> 00:23:29.284
- Oh, hey, guys.
- Kraglin!

00:23:29.367 --> 00:23:30.410
No, that's not it.

00:23:30.494 --> 00:23:32.746
- You been here this whole time?
- Yeah, you said to stay with the ship.

00:23:32.829 --> 00:23:35.165
This is Glenda. We're married.

00:23:35.248 --> 00:23:37.334
I am Groot.

00:23:37.417 --> 00:23:38.418
What did we tell you

00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:40.003
about jumpin' into new relationships?

00:23:40.170 --> 00:23:41.421
That I shouldn't be doing that.

00:23:41.505 --> 00:23:42.589
Yeah, you can't get married

00:23:42.672 --> 00:23:44.132
on every single planet we land on.

00:23:44.216 --> 00:23:45.801
I am Groot.

00:23:45.884 --> 00:23:47.803
Finally!

00:23:47.969 --> 00:23:49.763
All right, here we go. Distress calls.

00:23:50.347 --> 00:23:53.100
<i>Please help us!</i>
<i>The God Butcher has found us!</i>

00:23:53.183 --> 00:23:54.434
God Butcher?

00:23:54.518 --> 00:23:56.186
<i>He left them</i>
<i>hanging as a warning.</i>

00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:58.146
Look at all of these gods, murdered.

00:23:58.230 --> 00:24:00.107
<i>Our greatest champions,</i>

00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:02.025
<i>now laid to waste.</i>

00:24:02.109 --> 00:24:03.235
The horror.

00:24:03.318 --> 00:24:04.778
Who could have done something like this?

00:24:05.904 --> 00:24:07.030
<i>Thor, where are you?</i>

00:24:07.114 --> 00:24:08.698
Wait, wait, wait.
What was that? Go back.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.201
Play that one.

00:24:12.786 --> 00:24:14.287
<i>- Thor, where are you?</i>
- Sif?

00:24:14.371 --> 00:24:15.622
<i>We need you here.</i>

00:24:16.373 --> 00:24:18.333
My friend is in danger.
We must go at once.

00:24:18.416 --> 00:24:19.793
Start the ship, my friends.

00:24:19.876 --> 00:24:21.878
I don't know, maybe we should split up.

00:24:21.962 --> 00:24:22.963
So many people to save,

00:24:23.046 --> 00:24:25.048
I mean, look at all of these distress...

00:24:25.132 --> 00:24:26.633
...calls.

00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:31.012
Thor.

00:24:31.179 --> 00:24:32.514
You gonna be okay?

00:24:32.681 --> 00:24:34.141
I admire your commitment to each other.

00:24:34.224 --> 00:24:35.350
It's a beautiful thing.

00:24:35.433 --> 00:24:37.227
Alas, it's something I'll never have.

00:24:37.394 --> 00:24:38.770
Buddy, if I may...

00:24:39.354 --> 00:24:40.397
You may.

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.150
After thousands of years of living,

00:24:43.233 --> 00:24:44.442
you don't seem to know
who the hell you are.

00:24:45.443 --> 00:24:46.903
I've been lost before.

00:24:47.904 --> 00:24:49.614
But then I found meaning, I found love.

00:24:50.866 --> 00:24:51.950
And yeah, it got taken from me,

00:24:52.033 --> 00:24:53.160
and god, that hurts.

00:24:55.036 --> 00:24:57.706
But that shitty feeling
is better than feeling empty.

00:24:59.249 --> 00:25:00.250
My hope for you is that

00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:02.878
one day, you will find something

00:25:03.336 --> 00:25:05.505
to make you feel this shitty.

00:25:05.589 --> 00:25:08.508
I have loved before. It didn't work out.

00:25:08.592 --> 00:25:10.677
They either die a grismal death

00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.429
or they dump you
with a handwritten letter.

00:25:12.512 --> 00:25:13.513
I don't know which is worse,

00:25:13.597 --> 00:25:15.765
but it's why I keep everyone
at arm's length.

00:25:18.685 --> 00:25:19.686
You've grown too attached.

00:25:19.769 --> 00:25:20.937
Damn it, I knew this would happen.

00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:22.898
You must go. I'll find Sif.

00:25:23.648 --> 00:25:24.858
You answer the other calls.

00:25:24.941 --> 00:25:26.318
The galaxy needs its Guardians.

00:25:26.401 --> 00:25:27.402
Cool, yeah. We were just leaving...

00:25:27.485 --> 00:25:28.904
Shh. I know it hurts.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.739
But it's better this way.
You have to trust me.

00:25:31.698 --> 00:25:33.366
To ease the pain, why don't you, uh,

00:25:34.367 --> 00:25:36.870
take this ship here
as a parting farewell gift?

00:25:37.579 --> 00:25:38.955
Oh, you're giving me my ship?

00:25:39.039 --> 00:25:40.332
Yes, she's yours.

00:25:40.415 --> 00:25:43.210
May you make as many memories
with her as I have.

00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:44.878
She's a temperamental old lass.

00:25:45.045 --> 00:25:47.422
Will serve you well in a tight pickle.

00:25:47.505 --> 00:25:48.715
- I'll start the ship.
- Thank you.

00:25:48.798 --> 00:25:50.091
Goodbye, old friend.

00:25:51.718 --> 00:25:53.011
A human handshake

00:25:53.094 --> 00:25:54.971
to the Asgardian shake.

00:25:55.138 --> 00:25:57.599
Into the snake that you cannot trust.

00:25:58.767 --> 00:25:59.893
You're really dragging this out.

00:25:59.976 --> 00:26:02.812
And finish with the classic
Asgardian high one.

00:26:06.775 --> 00:26:07.943
Let's go.

00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:09.110
Take care of my crew.

00:26:09.194 --> 00:26:10.278
This is gonna be hard for them.

00:26:10.362 --> 00:26:11.571
Hurry up!

00:26:11.655 --> 00:26:12.739
Not her.

00:26:12.822 --> 00:26:14.157
Remember what I told you.

00:26:15.116 --> 00:26:16.576
You ever feel lost,

00:26:17.369 --> 00:26:19.663
just look into the eyes
of the people that you love.

00:26:19.746 --> 00:26:22.123
They'll tell you exactly who you are.

00:26:26.503 --> 00:26:27.462
All right. Bye.

00:26:31.174 --> 00:26:33.468
For what it's worth,
let's cling to the good memories.

00:26:33.551 --> 00:26:35.303
We Asgardians say,

00:26:35.387 --> 00:26:37.973
"May you travel with the speed
of Odin's ravens.

00:26:38.431 --> 00:26:39.599
"I'll see you in Valhalla

00:26:39.683 --> 00:26:41.518
"where we shall drink mead and..."

00:26:43.228 --> 00:26:45.689
- They're gone.
- Alone again. Just me and you.

00:26:45.772 --> 00:26:47.023
Stormbreaker!

00:26:47.941 --> 00:26:49.985
Watch out, you frickin' crazy axe!

00:26:53.613 --> 00:26:54.823
So what do we do now, bro?

00:26:54.906 --> 00:26:56.324
Let's go get Sif!

00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.717
Who or what is that?

00:27:13.883 --> 00:27:17.012
Falligar, God of the Falligarians.

00:27:17.512 --> 00:27:19.514
One of the nicest gods you'll ever meet.

00:27:21.099 --> 00:27:22.225
Oh, no.

00:27:31.026 --> 00:27:32.986
Sif, it's me, Thor.

00:27:33.570 --> 00:27:34.529
Odinson?

00:27:34.612 --> 00:27:36.114
You're missing an arm.

00:27:36.197 --> 00:27:37.449
I'm gonna get you home.

00:27:37.532 --> 00:27:39.659
No! Leave me here.

00:27:39.743 --> 00:27:41.703
I want to die a warrior's death.

00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:43.913
On the battlefield. In battle.

00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:46.958
And then I can claim my place
in Valhalla.

00:27:47.542 --> 00:27:49.502
Oh, I hate to break it to you,

00:27:49.586 --> 00:27:51.087
but for a warrior to get into Valhalla,

00:27:51.171 --> 00:27:52.547
you have to die in the battle.

00:27:53.256 --> 00:27:55.258
- You survived.
- Oh, shit.

00:27:55.884 --> 00:27:57.635
Maybe your arm is in Valhalla.

00:27:59.429 --> 00:28:00.555
What happened here?

00:28:00.638 --> 00:28:02.640
I've been hunting a madman.

00:28:02.807 --> 00:28:04.851
I followed him here, but it was a trap.

00:28:05.018 --> 00:28:06.019
Who is this madman?

00:28:06.603 --> 00:28:08.813
The God Butcher is coming.

00:28:08.897 --> 00:28:11.316
He seeks the extinction of the gods.

00:28:11.399 --> 00:28:13.360
Asgard is next.

00:30:03.761 --> 00:30:04.888
Look, it's Thor!

00:30:04.971 --> 00:30:06.931
- Thor!
- Take Sif to the infirmary.

00:30:07.182 --> 00:30:08.183
Hey!

00:30:08.266 --> 00:30:09.476
Who'd you piss off now?

00:30:09.559 --> 00:30:11.060
This is not my fault.
I've never even seen these things,

00:30:11.144 --> 00:30:12.145
whatever the hell they are.

00:30:12.228 --> 00:30:13.438
Welcome back.

00:30:38.838 --> 00:30:39.964
Who's the new guy?

00:30:40.548 --> 00:30:42.842
That guy? You're gonna love that guy.

00:30:57.232 --> 00:30:59.609
Mjol... Mjolnir! Mjolnir!

00:30:59.692 --> 00:31:00.818
It's me, Thor.

00:31:00.902 --> 00:31:02.153
Have you seen my hammer?

00:31:02.237 --> 00:31:03.780
Mjolnir, here, boy.

00:31:05.698 --> 00:31:07.283
Mjolnir?

00:31:11.538 --> 00:31:12.622
Mjolnir.

00:31:17.377 --> 00:31:19.837
You're back!

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:24.384
Mjolnir!

00:31:52.036 --> 00:31:53.413
Excuse me.

00:31:53.496 --> 00:31:55.248
Hello. That's my hammer
you've got there.

00:31:56.916 --> 00:31:58.084
And that's my look.

00:32:05.883 --> 00:32:06.884
Hey!

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.346
Enough tomfoolery.

00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:12.682
Why don't you take off
that mask and reveal yourself?

00:32:12.765 --> 00:32:13.850
Come on.

00:32:15.768 --> 00:32:16.769
Hey.

00:32:17.395 --> 00:32:18.813
Jane?

00:32:24.152 --> 00:32:27.155
<i>Let me tell you</i>
<i>the legend of Thor and Jane.</i>

00:32:28.906 --> 00:32:32.994
<i>He was a God of Thunder</i>
<i>and she, a woman of science.</i>

00:32:34.162 --> 00:32:36.581
<i>And although they were</i>
<i>from different worlds,</i>

00:32:38.374 --> 00:32:40.460
<i>somehow, it just made sense.</i>

00:32:40.543 --> 00:32:41.377
Whoo! Ha-ha!

00:32:41.461 --> 00:32:42.879
<i>And together they embarked</i>

00:32:42.962 --> 00:32:44.881
<i>on a journey of love.</i>

00:32:50.553 --> 00:32:52.889
<i>Thor taught Jane the way of the warrior...</i>

00:32:55.308 --> 00:32:58.061
<i>And Jane taught Thor</i>
<i>the way of the people.</i>

00:32:59.354 --> 00:33:00.938
<i>And as time passed,</i>

00:33:01.022 --> 00:33:03.650
<i>their love grew deeper and deeper.</i>

00:33:06.778 --> 00:33:08.780
She's incredible, isn't she, Mjolnir?

00:33:11.407 --> 00:33:14.744
I need you to promise me
you'll always protect her.

00:33:16.454 --> 00:33:18.373
I love you too, buddy.

00:33:19.957 --> 00:33:23.544
<i>And love that deep</i>
<i>has a way of becoming magical.</i>

00:33:27.256 --> 00:33:29.759
<i>Thor set his sights toward a future</i>

00:33:29.842 --> 00:33:31.969
<i>and all it might hold.</i>

00:33:35.181 --> 00:33:37.850
<i>But the more he pondered</i>
<i>a life with Jane,</i>

00:33:37.934 --> 00:33:39.977
<i>the more he feared losing that life.</i>

00:33:40.061 --> 00:33:42.814
<i>And although</i>
<i>Jane didn't want to admit it,</i>

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.316
<i>she was scared of loss as well.</i>

00:33:48.778 --> 00:33:51.030
<i>And so, they built walls between them.</i>

00:33:51.948 --> 00:33:53.991
<i>Thor got busy saving humanity.</i>

00:33:54.701 --> 00:33:55.785
Heimdall!

00:33:57.161 --> 00:33:59.831
<i>And Jane got busy doing the same.</i>

00:33:59.914 --> 00:34:01.708
<i>Real busy.</i>

00:34:01.791 --> 00:34:04.752
<i>And eventually, the space</i>
<i>between them grew and grew</i>

00:34:04.836 --> 00:34:06.921
<i>until it became too wide to bear.</i>

00:34:12.885 --> 00:34:14.345
<i>Something had to give.</i>

00:34:14.429 --> 00:34:17.974
I have to stay up all night
to go through this data. Okay?

00:34:18.057 --> 00:34:19.183
And I have to stay up all night

00:34:19.267 --> 00:34:21.436
- and clean all of this up.
- There's two plates!

00:34:21.519 --> 00:34:22.520
It's two plates and two forks!

00:34:26.858 --> 00:34:28.901
<i>And then, one night, it did give.</i>

00:34:30.528 --> 00:34:32.155
<i>Jane wrote a note.</i>

00:34:33.406 --> 00:34:35.408
<i>And Thor read that note.</i>

00:34:37.201 --> 00:34:39.829
<i>And their legend suddenly became myth.</i>

00:34:41.414 --> 00:34:43.249
<i>Or so they thought.</i>

00:34:45.835 --> 00:34:47.837
You okay?

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.882
Yeah...
it's a little, uh, hot in...

00:34:50.965 --> 00:34:53.009
Startin' to feel...

00:34:53.259 --> 00:34:56.053
It's claustrophobic with the helmet.

00:35:00.308 --> 00:35:01.309
How?

00:35:01.392 --> 00:35:02.810
Uh...

00:35:03.394 --> 00:35:05.730
Can we talk about this later?

00:35:06.272 --> 00:35:07.356
Yeah, sure.

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:08.775
Great seeing you.

00:35:10.401 --> 00:35:11.527
What?

00:35:17.909 --> 00:35:20.161
<i>Kill all the gods.</i>

00:35:58.616 --> 00:36:00.618
Hey. Is that the Necrosword?

00:36:00.785 --> 00:36:03.037
That's cool. I've only ever
read about it in stories.

00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:06.123
Then you know this is going to hurt.

00:36:06.207 --> 00:36:07.917
Pain.

00:36:08.084 --> 00:36:10.461
What is pain but a construct
invented by the weak?

00:36:10.545 --> 00:36:11.838
Okay, that's very sharp!

00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.139
Ready?

00:36:23.015 --> 00:36:26.060
Don't touch my things.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.881
Yeah, you better run, you coward.

00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:16.402
The children.
They're taking the children!

00:37:16.485 --> 00:37:18.154
Mommy!

00:37:20.364 --> 00:37:21.407
Mom!

00:37:45.181 --> 00:37:47.642
Shadow monsters. Disgusting.

00:37:51.354 --> 00:37:53.564
Flew around the world twice. Nothing.

00:37:53.648 --> 00:37:56.901
- Cowards must have run away.
- We'll find them.

00:37:59.570 --> 00:38:01.530
- Quite a reunion, huh?
- Eh, you're telling me.

00:38:01.697 --> 00:38:03.532
What's it been? Like, three, four years?

00:38:03.824 --> 00:38:05.952
Eight years, seven months, and six days.

00:38:06.035 --> 00:38:07.370
I haven't forgotten

00:38:07.495 --> 00:38:08.704
the last time I saw you,

00:38:08.788 --> 00:38:10.539
or didn't see you, because you left.

00:38:10.623 --> 00:38:12.416
It's kind of an oversimplification

00:38:12.500 --> 00:38:13.584
to say that I left.

00:38:13.668 --> 00:38:15.920
Ah, no, you left. You did.

00:38:16.087 --> 00:38:17.922
You wrote me a beautiful
handwritten letter.

00:38:18.089 --> 00:38:20.049
I should know, I was there.

00:38:20.132 --> 00:38:21.300
- You weren't there...
- I was.

00:38:21.384 --> 00:38:22.760
...actually, hence the note.

00:38:24.387 --> 00:38:26.222
And if you weren't
there to see me leave,

00:38:26.305 --> 00:38:28.057
then maybe it was you that left.

00:38:28.933 --> 00:38:30.768
- Fair point. Hmm.
- Uh...

00:38:30.851 --> 00:38:32.311
Not that it matters.

00:38:32.395 --> 00:38:33.562
Like, who's keeping track, right?

00:38:33.646 --> 00:38:35.106
No, yeah.

00:38:35.189 --> 00:38:37.608
I suppose we both left
and both got left.

00:38:37.692 --> 00:38:38.818
Now you're leaving again.

00:38:40.945 --> 00:38:42.154
Miek, we need detailed accounts

00:38:42.238 --> 00:38:43.322
from all the witnesses.

00:38:43.406 --> 00:38:44.490
Darryl, get me all the names

00:38:44.573 --> 00:38:45.616
of the children who have been lost.

00:38:46.283 --> 00:38:47.702
Your Majesty,
my daughter has been taken,

00:38:47.785 --> 00:38:48.786
and I don't know where she is.

00:38:48.869 --> 00:38:50.246
And she'll be found.

00:38:50.329 --> 00:38:51.789
Guys, they're bleeding.

00:38:51.872 --> 00:38:53.290
Get them to the infirmary. Now!

00:38:53.374 --> 00:38:54.375
Darryl!

00:38:54.542 --> 00:38:56.460
Majesty, should we start working

00:38:56.544 --> 00:38:58.337
on a performance of this entire debacle?

00:38:58.504 --> 00:39:00.089
The people need entertainment.

00:39:00.172 --> 00:39:01.841
Particularly now, in times of crisis.

00:39:01.924 --> 00:39:03.509
Particularly.

00:39:05.511 --> 00:39:06.762
I did not hear a, "No."

00:39:07.221 --> 00:39:08.431
Nor did I.

00:39:08.597 --> 00:39:09.724
- Asgard. Night.
- Yes!

00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:11.100
We open on some sleeping children.

00:39:15.396 --> 00:39:17.690
So, that's the ex-girlfriend, is it?

00:39:17.773 --> 00:39:19.150
The old ex-girlfriend.

00:39:19.316 --> 00:39:20.359
Jodie Foster.

00:39:20.526 --> 00:39:21.569
Jane Foster.

00:39:21.652 --> 00:39:22.862
The one that got away.

00:39:22.945 --> 00:39:24.613
The one that got away.

00:39:24.697 --> 00:39:25.740
That means escaped.

00:39:25.823 --> 00:39:27.491
Yeah. Yeah... Yeah.

00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:29.785
Must be hard for you
to see your ex-girlfriend

00:39:29.869 --> 00:39:31.454
and your ex-hammer hangin' out,

00:39:31.537 --> 00:39:32.913
and getting on so well.

00:39:37.209 --> 00:39:38.461
What you up to, bro?

00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:40.463
Come on.

00:39:41.005 --> 00:39:42.256
Come to daddy.

00:39:42.339 --> 00:39:45.259
Come on. Mjolnir.

00:39:46.927 --> 00:39:49.638
Hey! There you are.

00:39:49.722 --> 00:39:50.765
Hey.

00:39:50.848 --> 00:39:51.891
Do you know
what I think we should do?

00:39:51.974 --> 00:39:53.684
- I was just calling you.
- Start an army!

00:39:53.768 --> 00:39:55.686
With what? Half our soldiers are dead!

00:39:55.770 --> 00:39:57.354
Half our soldiers are always dead!

00:39:57.438 --> 00:39:59.482
- Where are the children?
- Everyone, please go home.

00:39:59.565 --> 00:40:00.566
I promise you we'll have news soon.

00:40:00.649 --> 00:40:02.068
Someone needs to tell us what happened.

00:40:02.151 --> 00:40:03.736
We shall find them.

00:40:05.738 --> 00:40:07.073
- I just don't understand.
- You know what?

00:40:07.156 --> 00:40:08.449
This is all our fault.

00:40:08.532 --> 00:40:09.742
Stop it!

00:40:09.825 --> 00:40:10.910
Asgard!

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:22.797
My friends, we must not quarrel.

00:40:23.756 --> 00:40:26.550
In times like this, we need
to unite, come together.

00:40:26.634 --> 00:40:28.761
I see what's happening here.

00:40:29.428 --> 00:40:31.639
You're afraid. Hmm?

00:40:32.264 --> 00:40:33.307
Scared.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.643
Afraid.

00:40:35.726 --> 00:40:36.936
Anxious.

00:40:38.813 --> 00:40:39.814
If we are to find the children,

00:40:39.897 --> 00:40:43.025
we must first look within ourselves.

00:40:43.109 --> 00:40:44.902
I'm sorry. Miek, it's very hard

00:40:44.985 --> 00:40:47.446
to give a rousing speech
with the noise.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:49.073
- What are you doing?
- She's taking minutes.

00:40:49.156 --> 00:40:50.491
Oh, precious minutes we don't have.

00:40:50.574 --> 00:40:52.576
You want the kids back?

00:40:53.702 --> 00:40:55.329
I'll be back in a minute.

00:40:56.247 --> 00:40:57.581
You can write that down, Miek.

00:41:00.417 --> 00:41:01.252
No!

00:41:10.261 --> 00:41:12.012
Stormbreaker, what are you doing?

00:41:12.096 --> 00:41:13.597
Is this about Mjolnir?

00:41:13.681 --> 00:41:15.182
Everyone, out!

00:41:17.101 --> 00:41:18.936
Didn't find them.

00:41:19.019 --> 00:41:20.146
Oh, bae, your cape's on fire.

00:41:20.229 --> 00:41:21.272
It's fine. It'll grow back.

00:41:21.355 --> 00:41:22.773
I'm invoicing you for this.

00:41:22.857 --> 00:41:23.858
Listen.

00:41:23.941 --> 00:41:25.025
What do we know about this guy?

00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:26.485
He travels through shadows.

00:41:26.569 --> 00:41:28.070
And he creates monsters with them.

00:41:28.154 --> 00:41:29.655
Absolutely freaky monsters.

00:41:29.738 --> 00:41:31.824
He also wields the Necrosword.
How do I know that?

00:41:31.907 --> 00:41:33.367
Because he almost speared me
in the face with it.

00:41:33.450 --> 00:41:34.368
What's a Necrosword?

00:41:34.451 --> 00:41:35.870
It's an ancient weapon
that's been passed

00:41:35.953 --> 00:41:37.454
through hands since the dawn of time.

00:41:37.538 --> 00:41:39.790
It has the ability to slay gods,

00:41:39.874 --> 00:41:41.417
but it slowly corrupts and kills

00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:43.002
whoever wields it, which means...

00:41:43.085 --> 00:41:44.587
Oh, so, it infected him.

00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:46.380
It's infecting him. Yes. It must be.

00:41:46.463 --> 00:41:48.966
So basically,
we're up against a cursed,

00:41:49.049 --> 00:41:50.801
shadow-zombie kidnapper.

00:41:51.177 --> 00:41:52.678
Awesome. When do we leave?

00:41:52.761 --> 00:41:54.138
Thor.

00:41:54.221 --> 00:41:55.723
Can you see me?

00:41:55.806 --> 00:41:57.057
Uh, floating head alert.

00:41:57.141 --> 00:41:58.976
It's Astrid. Heimdall's son.

00:41:59.059 --> 00:42:00.853
Astrid, are you okay?

00:42:00.936 --> 00:42:02.938
I no longer go by the name Astrid.

00:42:03.105 --> 00:42:05.065
I'm now known as Axl.

00:42:05.232 --> 00:42:07.443
He's a singer from a popular band
I heard on Earth.

00:42:07.526 --> 00:42:08.777
- G N' R.
- Astrid,

00:42:08.861 --> 00:42:10.863
your father gave you
a very tough Viking name

00:42:10.946 --> 00:42:12.531
and I intend to honour his wishes.

00:42:12.615 --> 00:42:13.699
- Axl.
- Astrid.

00:42:13.782 --> 00:42:14.992
- I said Axl.
- Astrid.

00:42:15.075 --> 00:42:17.286
- Axl!
- It's asshole. Now listen to him!

00:42:17.369 --> 00:42:19.955
All right, fine, Axl. Where are you?

00:42:20.122 --> 00:42:23.375
I'm not sure. I don't know
how to use my magic eyes yet.

00:42:23.459 --> 00:42:24.877
Your father taught me
and I'm gonna teach you.

00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:27.463
I need you to focus
and hold out your hand.

00:42:27.546 --> 00:42:30.090
Okay, good. Now focus.

00:42:30.257 --> 00:42:31.383
Close your eyes.

00:42:35.888 --> 00:42:38.390
Thor!

00:42:40.351 --> 00:42:41.769
Hey, how's it going, kids?

00:42:41.852 --> 00:42:43.687
"How's it going"? Look where we are.

00:42:43.854 --> 00:42:45.731
We're in a cage made of spikes.

00:42:46.398 --> 00:42:48.067
Yes, right. Not good. Yeah.

00:42:48.234 --> 00:42:49.318
Are you gonna do something?

00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:51.070
Yes. Yes, I am, but just not right now.

00:42:51.153 --> 00:42:53.155
I'm the vision ghost. Look.

00:42:54.573 --> 00:42:56.200
- See?
- What will happen to us?

00:42:56.283 --> 00:42:57.826
Who can tell?

00:42:57.910 --> 00:42:59.954
I mean, this is a very,
very bad situation.

00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:02.539
You know, the good news
is you're Asgardians.

00:43:02.706 --> 00:43:04.833
So, if you die,
you'll end up in Valhalla.

00:43:04.917 --> 00:43:06.085
Oh, my God. Go away.

00:43:06.252 --> 00:43:07.962
Wait, wait. Listen.

00:43:09.505 --> 00:43:10.881
Okay. It's all right, children.

00:43:10.965 --> 00:43:12.383
Don't cry. Don't cry. It's okay.

00:43:12.549 --> 00:43:13.884
Listen, I've got a plan, okay?

00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:15.970
I'm putting together
a really, really good team.

00:43:16.053 --> 00:43:19.640
We've got, um, Uncle Korg,
uh, King Valkyrie,

00:43:19.723 --> 00:43:21.850
um, my ex-girlfriend, Jane,

00:43:21.934 --> 00:43:24.144
which is a whole other story
I won't bore you with, okay?

00:43:24.228 --> 00:43:26.522
But it is a top-notch team,

00:43:26.605 --> 00:43:28.399
and we're gonna have you home
before you know it.

00:43:28.482 --> 00:43:29.733
Yeah.

00:43:37.116 --> 00:43:38.158
I know where you are.

00:43:41.370 --> 00:43:42.538
I'm gonna get you out of here.

00:43:42.621 --> 00:43:43.831
I'm scared.

00:43:43.914 --> 00:43:46.125
We all are.

00:43:46.208 --> 00:43:48.294
Thor! Thor! Save us.

00:43:52.006 --> 00:43:53.299
Get me out of here. You take care, okay?

00:43:53.382 --> 00:43:55.175
Take care. I'll see you soon. All right?

00:43:55.259 --> 00:43:56.510
Axl, get me out of here!

00:43:58.053 --> 00:43:59.096
They're in the Shadow Realm.

00:43:59.179 --> 00:44:00.264
How do you know?

00:44:00.431 --> 00:44:02.975
The heavy atmosphere there
has a darkness like no other.

00:44:03.142 --> 00:44:05.102
It's as if colour fears to tread.
It's unmistakable.

00:44:05.936 --> 00:44:07.604
Well then, if it's colour we need,

00:44:08.063 --> 00:44:09.565
let's bring the rainbow.

00:44:11.567 --> 00:44:13.444
"Bring the rainbow"?
Is that a catchphrase or something?

00:44:13.610 --> 00:44:15.154
She's only been a Thor for a minute.

00:44:15.237 --> 00:44:16.655
I mean, saving lives,
she's quite good at.

00:44:16.739 --> 00:44:17.865
But the rest of it, she needs work.

00:44:17.948 --> 00:44:18.949
How many catchphrases have there been?

00:44:19.033 --> 00:44:19.992
A lot.

00:44:21.744 --> 00:44:23.579
Yep. Jumped the gun.

00:44:23.662 --> 00:44:24.997
Hang on, he moves through shadows

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:26.290
and he's going to the Shadow Realm,

00:44:26.373 --> 00:44:27.374
it seems like that's where

00:44:27.458 --> 00:44:28.417
he's going to be the most powerful.

00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:29.543
You're right. We can't just go

00:44:29.626 --> 00:44:30.669
marching in there. It could be a trap.

00:44:30.753 --> 00:44:31.795
We'd be endangering the children.

00:44:31.879 --> 00:44:33.088
- Mm.
- We need reinforcements.

00:44:33.172 --> 00:44:34.173
We must raise an army.

00:44:34.256 --> 00:44:35.549
Are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

00:44:35.632 --> 00:44:36.967
- I'm thinking it.
- What are we thinking?

00:44:37.051 --> 00:44:38.385
- Thinking what?
- I'm thinking it too.

00:44:38.469 --> 00:44:40.763
- Omnipotence City.
- Hmm!

00:44:40.846 --> 00:44:42.681
What's Omnipotence City?

00:44:42.765 --> 00:44:44.892
It's the home of the most
powerful gods in the universe.

00:44:45.059 --> 00:44:46.894
We could pull together
the greatest team ever.

00:44:47.061 --> 00:44:49.229
We could recruit Ra, Hercules,

00:44:49.313 --> 00:44:50.606
Tumatauenga

00:44:50.689 --> 00:44:52.107
Quetzalcoatl, maybe.

00:44:52.191 --> 00:44:54.443
And Zeus, the oldest
and wisest of them all.

00:44:54.526 --> 00:44:56.528
- Did you say Zeus?
- Yeah, Zeus.

00:44:56.612 --> 00:44:58.238
Like, the Zeus. Zeus-Zeus?

00:44:58.322 --> 00:44:59.656
I'm not sure if he has a second name.

00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:00.949
Do you think my god will be there,

00:45:01.033 --> 00:45:02.034
Ninny of the Nonny?

00:45:02.117 --> 00:45:03.118
Oh, you never know, Korg.

00:45:03.202 --> 00:45:04.161
But if they are,
we'll ask them to join our team.

00:45:04.244 --> 00:45:05.287
Yes.

00:45:05.371 --> 00:45:07.122
Stormbreaker.

00:45:07.206 --> 00:45:08.999
All right. Calm down. Relax.

00:45:09.083 --> 00:45:10.376
No, no, no, mate, we are not travelling

00:45:10.459 --> 00:45:12.002
in Stormbreaker's janky Bifrost.

00:45:12.086 --> 00:45:13.087
Look what just happened.

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:14.671
We can't exactly go
in your tiny, little,

00:45:14.755 --> 00:45:16.465
flying portal horse, can we?
We won't all fit.

00:45:16.548 --> 00:45:18.050
What are you talking about?
Warsong's awesome.

00:45:18.133 --> 00:45:19.343
Stormbreaker's awesome too.

00:45:19.426 --> 00:45:20.803
Stormbreaker just needs a conduit.

00:45:20.886 --> 00:45:22.221
Anything that can handle space travel.

00:45:22.304 --> 00:45:23.639
I love it when she talks shop.

00:45:23.722 --> 00:45:25.140
It has the power to get us there,

00:45:25.224 --> 00:45:26.683
it just needs something
to focus that energy

00:45:26.767 --> 00:45:28.852
so it's not so unpredictable.

00:45:28.936 --> 00:45:30.896
You know, if we had a ship,
we could harness it

00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:32.564
and use Stormbreaker as a power source.

00:45:32.648 --> 00:45:34.483
- Oh, like an engine.
- Like an engine.

00:45:34.566 --> 00:45:35.692
You need a ship?

00:45:35.776 --> 00:45:36.944
I've got a ship.

00:45:41.865 --> 00:45:43.117
Get rid of all those seats.

00:45:43.283 --> 00:45:45.327
And you guys,
go tie those goats to the front.

00:45:45.494 --> 00:45:46.829
We leave in 15 minutes.

00:45:46.912 --> 00:45:48.831
Essentials only, everyone.

00:45:48.914 --> 00:45:50.791
That's essential. Mm-hmm.

00:45:50.874 --> 00:45:52.126
Fifteen minutes to departure!

00:45:52.209 --> 00:45:54.503
Well, you moved on quick,
didn't you?

00:45:55.671 --> 00:45:57.089
You're some piece of work.

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:00.426
- Oh, hey!
- Hey.

00:46:00.509 --> 00:46:02.177
Just catching up with an old friend.

00:46:02.261 --> 00:46:03.303
Yeah.

00:46:03.387 --> 00:46:05.097
I've been meaning to apologise.

00:46:05.597 --> 00:46:06.932
Sorta acting a little weird before.

00:46:07.015 --> 00:46:08.559
I just haven't really
been myself lately.

00:46:08.725 --> 00:46:10.185
You know, kind of...

00:46:10.352 --> 00:46:11.562
Trying to figure out who I am,

00:46:11.645 --> 00:46:13.355
and, uh, just felt a little bit lost.

00:46:13.522 --> 00:46:16.191
And then, all of a sudden,
I see you dressed as me

00:46:16.275 --> 00:46:17.651
and it was kind of...

00:46:17.734 --> 00:46:19.153
It's a lot for me, too.

00:46:19.695 --> 00:46:22.489
So, how did you guys get together?
How did this happen?

00:46:23.157 --> 00:46:26.285
I swear I heard Mjolnir call to me.

00:46:26.368 --> 00:46:27.870
Ah! Did it?

00:46:28.036 --> 00:46:29.705
And so I came here to investigate,

00:46:29.788 --> 00:46:32.541
and its pieces started glowing
and swirling,

00:46:32.624 --> 00:46:33.792
- and then...
- Crazy.

00:46:33.876 --> 00:46:35.377
- ...Thor.
- Ah.

00:46:35.461 --> 00:46:36.753
Well, you know what,

00:46:36.837 --> 00:46:39.006
it looks good on you, it works, so...

00:46:41.550 --> 00:46:42.968
Whew.

00:46:43.051 --> 00:46:44.052
Just checking.

00:46:47.931 --> 00:46:49.099
See you later.

00:46:49.183 --> 00:46:51.393
Five minutes to departure!

00:46:55.522 --> 00:46:56.690
What?

00:46:57.149 --> 00:46:58.692
We were just talking.

00:47:09.703 --> 00:47:11.955
<i>Mommy, don't leave me.</i>

00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:13.999
Don't be afraid.

00:47:15.584 --> 00:47:17.085
<i>Even when I'm gone, honey...</i>

00:47:18.879 --> 00:47:20.672
<i>You won't be alone.</i>

00:47:23.342 --> 00:47:25.344
<i>And whatever happens...</i>

00:47:27.179 --> 00:47:28.931
<i>never stop fighting.</i>

00:47:29.473 --> 00:47:31.308
<i>Never stop fighting.</i>

00:47:45.447 --> 00:47:47.157
Hey. You all right?

00:47:47.241 --> 00:47:49.034
- Great.
- Mm.

00:47:50.077 --> 00:47:51.453
The sink would say otherwise.

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:54.873
You think I really should be coming?

00:47:54.957 --> 00:47:56.500
I'm not getting any better.

00:47:56.667 --> 00:47:58.335
You're a Thor.
Of course, you should come.

00:47:58.418 --> 00:48:00.212
Besides, what else are you gonna do?

00:48:00.295 --> 00:48:01.588
You're a Viking now.

00:48:01.755 --> 00:48:03.840
Means you pretty much
have to die in battle,

00:48:03.924 --> 00:48:06.093
and it needs to be
devastatingly painful.

00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.636
Otherwise, you don't get into Valhalla.

00:48:07.719 --> 00:48:08.971
That's my plan.

00:48:09.054 --> 00:48:11.848
What about, you know, kinging and stuff?

00:48:11.932 --> 00:48:14.476
I love being king. I love my people,

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:16.144
but it's all meetings and raven-mail,

00:48:16.228 --> 00:48:17.854
and meetings
that could've been raven-mail.

00:48:18.021 --> 00:48:19.189
I miss fighting.

00:48:19.356 --> 00:48:20.524
I miss my sisters.

00:48:20.607 --> 00:48:22.484
Which is why you need to come,
'cause I need one.

00:48:23.652 --> 00:48:24.611
Okay, we should go.

00:48:24.695 --> 00:48:25.988
You packed?

00:48:26.613 --> 00:48:27.573
Are you packed?

00:48:29.491 --> 00:48:30.909
Yes!

00:48:32.911 --> 00:48:33.954
A hand grenade?

00:48:34.037 --> 00:48:36.290
No. It's a portable speaker.

00:48:42.004 --> 00:48:43.422
Let's go.

00:48:44.339 --> 00:48:47.884
If you don't mind keeping
the sink thing under wraps?

00:48:47.968 --> 00:48:49.344
I got you.

00:48:52.055 --> 00:48:53.765
My fellow Asgardians...

00:48:53.849 --> 00:48:56.101
Wish us well, for we shall travel

00:48:56.184 --> 00:48:58.270
with the speed of Odin's ravens.

00:48:58.353 --> 00:49:01.148
We will return with children.

00:49:02.524 --> 00:49:04.276
Many children.

00:49:04.443 --> 00:49:06.069
And then we shall feast!

00:49:06.153 --> 00:49:07.863
Not on the children.

00:49:07.946 --> 00:49:09.656
We do not do that anymore.

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.701
Those were dark times. Shameful times.

00:49:12.784 --> 00:49:14.411
Okay, we should go.

00:50:01.333 --> 00:50:02.751
So, you still rollerblading?

00:50:02.834 --> 00:50:04.670
No. No. You?

00:50:04.753 --> 00:50:06.088
Oh, yeah. Every weekend.

00:50:06.171 --> 00:50:07.964
Once you blade, you never fade.
Right, Korg?

00:50:08.048 --> 00:50:08.882
Skate mates for life!

00:50:08.965 --> 00:50:10.592
Hey, can I run something by you?

00:50:10.676 --> 00:50:12.177
- Yeah.
- So, I was thinking,

00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.637
when we get to the bad guy,

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:15.806
what about if I had, like,
a cool catchphrase?

00:50:16.598 --> 00:50:18.433
Like, "Eat this hammer!" Bang!

00:50:18.517 --> 00:50:19.685
Or, like,

00:50:19.768 --> 00:50:21.770
"Check out my hammer." Boom!

00:50:21.895 --> 00:50:23.563
Like, what about, um...

00:50:23.730 --> 00:50:25.607
No... I'm workshopping it.

00:50:25.774 --> 00:50:28.110
No, they are all really good.
Mine is, uh,

00:50:28.276 --> 00:50:30.112
"This ends here and now."

00:50:30.195 --> 00:50:31.363
Oh, that's such a good one.

00:50:31.530 --> 00:50:32.781
Took me a long time to perfect it.

00:50:32.864 --> 00:50:34.199
You'll get there.
You just need to practise.

00:50:34.282 --> 00:50:35.701
Just my first bad guy.

00:50:35.867 --> 00:50:37.119
You never forget your first.

00:50:40.539 --> 00:50:41.540
Yeah.

00:50:42.165 --> 00:50:43.458
So, you got a girlfriend?

00:50:44.126 --> 00:50:45.669
Oh... No, no.

00:50:45.752 --> 00:50:47.629
Too busy, don't have time, you know?

00:50:48.171 --> 00:50:50.048
Just the work and everything.

00:50:50.215 --> 00:50:52.634
Cool. Gonna check this place out.

00:50:55.178 --> 00:50:56.680
Oh, wow.

00:50:56.763 --> 00:50:57.764
So cool.

00:50:57.931 --> 00:50:58.932
- Who's so cool?
- Huh?

00:50:59.099 --> 00:51:00.559
The buildings are cool.

00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:02.477
- What's happening there?
- Where?

00:51:02.644 --> 00:51:05.147
Am I, uh, sensing feelings?

00:51:05.230 --> 00:51:06.231
Feelings?

00:51:06.314 --> 00:51:07.524
- What, for Jane?
- Mm-hmm.

00:51:07.607 --> 00:51:09.067
No, don't be ridiculous. Feelings.

00:51:09.234 --> 00:51:10.986
The last time we had feelings were

00:51:11.069 --> 00:51:12.821
long time ago.
Long, long gone. I think you...

00:51:12.904 --> 00:51:14.364
- Maybe you have feelings.
- Right.

00:51:14.448 --> 00:51:16.158
Oh... Mate, relax.

00:51:16.241 --> 00:51:17.367
- I don't know.
- We're on the same team.

00:51:17.451 --> 00:51:19.953
Know exactly what team we're on, okay?

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.455
Team Jane.

00:51:23.081 --> 00:51:24.374
Um...

00:51:25.792 --> 00:51:28.253
<i>Thing about Thor is that</i>
<i>he always bounces back.</i>

00:51:28.336 --> 00:51:30.380
- Yeah.
- Like when Hela stole his hammer,

00:51:30.464 --> 00:51:31.673
he went and built an axe
which was forged

00:51:31.757 --> 00:51:33.216
in the heart of a dying star.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:39.347
And the same axe was used
to cut off Thanos' head.

00:51:40.432 --> 00:51:42.142
That's a good one.

00:51:45.562 --> 00:51:47.773
What a neat story!

00:51:49.858 --> 00:51:52.944
Ah, with all this talk
about chopping off heads,

00:51:53.111 --> 00:51:54.446
I wanna have a go.

00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:56.823
What's this?

00:51:56.907 --> 00:51:57.908
Oh.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:01.536
Aw!

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:04.122
This is Octy. Hello, Octy.

00:52:04.206 --> 00:52:06.374
How are you?

00:52:06.458 --> 00:52:08.418
You know what Octy loves?

00:52:08.877 --> 00:52:10.837
Having his head ripped off!

00:52:14.883 --> 00:52:17.427
What? You liked it a second ago.

00:52:18.678 --> 00:52:20.013
All right, all right, all right.

00:52:20.096 --> 00:52:21.306
Octy's gone.

00:52:25.268 --> 00:52:27.103
Come on.

00:52:27.187 --> 00:52:28.355
I'm scared.

00:52:28.438 --> 00:52:30.190
Aw, look at you.

00:52:31.399 --> 00:52:34.361
I knew a little girl just like you.

00:52:34.903 --> 00:52:38.532
And she was brave, and she was smart...

00:52:40.283 --> 00:52:43.787
and funny and she liked to draw.

00:52:46.498 --> 00:52:48.291
Let me ask you a question

00:52:49.835 --> 00:52:51.044
about gods.

00:52:51.628 --> 00:52:53.630
They're meant to protect you, right?

00:52:54.297 --> 00:52:55.632
Well, where are they?

00:52:55.715 --> 00:52:58.635
- Thor is on his way.
- Yeah!

00:52:58.718 --> 00:53:01.346
Yes. I'm counting on that.

00:53:01.972 --> 00:53:03.723
That's why you're here.

00:53:07.561 --> 00:53:08.603
It's invitation only,

00:53:08.687 --> 00:53:10.105
so we're gonna have to keep
a low profile and blend in.

00:53:10.188 --> 00:53:13.149
Luckily, disguises are my specialty.

00:53:13.942 --> 00:53:14.985
Greek philosopher?

00:53:15.569 --> 00:53:16.570
Got us these.

00:53:17.195 --> 00:53:18.196
What are those?

00:53:18.363 --> 00:53:19.322
Actual disguises.

00:53:20.156 --> 00:53:22.200
They're the cloaks of the emotion gods.

00:53:22.284 --> 00:53:26.037
Every colour signifies
a different emotion.

00:53:26.955 --> 00:53:27.956
Where are the emotion gods?

00:53:28.039 --> 00:53:29.541
Mm. Don't ask.

00:53:32.919 --> 00:53:34.087
Holy shit.

00:53:43.179 --> 00:53:45.098
Welcome to the Golden Temple, kids.

00:53:45.265 --> 00:53:47.309
This is where
the most powerful creator gods

00:53:47.392 --> 00:53:48.476
in the universe hang out.

00:53:51.104 --> 00:53:53.940
There's the god of magic,

00:53:54.024 --> 00:53:55.233
the god of dreams,

00:53:55.317 --> 00:53:56.443
the god of carpentry.

00:53:56.526 --> 00:53:57.903
Look at that one.

00:53:58.069 --> 00:53:59.613
Oh, yes. That's Bao, god of dumplings.

00:53:59.696 --> 00:54:01.907
- Psst. Hey, Bao!
- Bao.

00:54:01.990 --> 00:54:03.074
Look up there, guys!

00:54:03.158 --> 00:54:04.993
That's the Kronan god,
Ninny of the Nonny.

00:54:05.619 --> 00:54:07.329
Hey, Ninny Nonny!

00:54:17.213 --> 00:54:20.467
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:20.550 --> 00:54:23.094
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:23.178 --> 00:54:25.805
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:25.889 --> 00:54:28.099
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:30.810 --> 00:54:32.729
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:32.812 --> 00:54:35.231
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:35.315 --> 00:54:37.484
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:37.567 --> 00:54:39.653
Zeus! Zeus! Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:39.736 --> 00:54:41.863
Zeus! Zeus!

00:54:49.829 --> 00:54:50.956
Yes.

00:54:52.165 --> 00:54:53.583
I am Zeus!

00:54:54.751 --> 00:54:55.919
<i>Yassas!</i>

00:54:58.129 --> 00:54:59.297
Oh, there he is!

00:54:59.381 --> 00:55:01.424
The man, the myth, the legend.

00:55:01.508 --> 00:55:02.759
Oh, I don't know if you know this,

00:55:02.842 --> 00:55:05.011
but I base a lot of what I do
on this guy.

00:55:05.178 --> 00:55:06.888
He's the god of lightning,
I'm the god of thunder.

00:55:06.972 --> 00:55:09.140
- Huge source of inspiration.
- That's really good.

00:55:09.224 --> 00:55:11.685
You should lead with that
when you ask him for an army.

00:55:11.768 --> 00:55:13.728
- Ah.
- Um, how do we get up there?

00:55:13.812 --> 00:55:15.397
Do we just, like, fly?

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:16.898
No, we can't interrupt him
in the middle of an entrance.

00:55:16.982 --> 00:55:18.692
He's famous for his entrances.

00:55:18.775 --> 00:55:20.568
Thunderbolt! Thunderbolt!

00:55:21.194 --> 00:55:23.279
Yes!

00:55:24.906 --> 00:55:26.658
Zeus!

00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:37.669
Yes! Thunderbolt!

00:55:45.427 --> 00:55:46.428
Order.

00:55:47.012 --> 00:55:48.096
Order!

00:55:49.973 --> 00:55:52.392
Silence! Silence!

00:55:56.396 --> 00:55:58.523
I hereby open

00:55:59.190 --> 00:56:02.527
this holy council of the god.

00:56:02.610 --> 00:56:05.905
Where we have many, many serious matter

00:56:05.989 --> 00:56:07.323
to be talk about.

00:56:07.407 --> 00:56:08.908
Such as,

00:56:09.826 --> 00:56:11.995
where are we going to hold
this year's orgy?

00:56:12.078 --> 00:56:14.122
Is this guy for real?

00:56:14.205 --> 00:56:15.373
Honestly, I'm not mad at it.

00:56:15.457 --> 00:56:17.000
Yeah, I'm sure he has a point, okay?

00:56:17.083 --> 00:56:18.793
Sorry.

00:56:18.877 --> 00:56:20.086
So now we're going to
announce the winner

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:23.048
of the, "Most human souls

00:56:23.131 --> 00:56:25.258
"sacrificed in the name of a god."

00:56:25.341 --> 00:56:27.010
Okay, maybe he's not that great.

00:56:27.093 --> 00:56:28.428
Oh, no, not good.

00:56:28.511 --> 00:56:30.430
No, I don't think it's gonna
get any better than this.

00:56:30.513 --> 00:56:31.890
Look, these gods aren't gonna help.

00:56:31.973 --> 00:56:33.058
But that thunderbolt,

00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:34.517
I think that might be of use.

00:56:34.601 --> 00:56:36.603
Jane, you go right. Thor, you go left.

00:56:36.686 --> 00:56:37.812
We bum-rush him,

00:56:37.896 --> 00:56:39.189
take the bolt, ding-dong.

00:56:39.272 --> 00:56:40.315
All right, let's go get it!

00:56:40.398 --> 00:56:41.566
No, no, no, wait, wait, wait!

00:56:41.649 --> 00:56:43.401
There's no ding-donging or bum-rushing.

00:56:43.485 --> 00:56:44.903
Especially not Zeus' bum.

00:56:44.986 --> 00:56:46.571
When the time is right,
I'm gonna talk to him.

00:56:46.654 --> 00:56:47.697
The time is right now.

00:56:47.781 --> 00:56:49.282
Time is not right now.

00:56:49.365 --> 00:56:50.241
Who is talking?

00:56:50.325 --> 00:56:51.409
Who is talking?

00:56:51.493 --> 00:56:52.410
- These guys.
- Korg, shut up.

00:56:52.494 --> 00:56:55.371
Do you have something to say
to the group?

00:56:55.455 --> 00:56:56.873
Sorry.

00:56:56.956 --> 00:56:59.667
I'm bashing heads in 60 seconds,
so speak fast.

00:56:59.834 --> 00:57:01.252
Literally, heads will roll.

00:57:02.087 --> 00:57:03.338
Who are you two?

00:57:04.255 --> 00:57:05.632
Hello.

00:57:05.715 --> 00:57:07.133
Uh, let me be the first to say

00:57:07.217 --> 00:57:08.426
it is an honour and a privilege to be...

00:57:08.510 --> 00:57:09.636
No, I can't hear you.

00:57:09.803 --> 00:57:11.137
Why don't you take the stage?

00:57:11.221 --> 00:57:13.181
The stage down there?

00:57:13.348 --> 00:57:15.225
Well, yes. You see the area

00:57:15.308 --> 00:57:17.602
that looks very much like a stage?

00:57:19.187 --> 00:57:20.188
Got ya.

00:57:27.278 --> 00:57:28.780
Coming through.

00:57:29.572 --> 00:57:30.824
Oops. Sorry.

00:57:30.907 --> 00:57:31.991
Good luck, bro.

00:57:39.833 --> 00:57:41.084
Mighty Zeus!

00:57:41.167 --> 00:57:42.752
Wow!

00:57:43.378 --> 00:57:44.921
Gods of the universe,

00:57:45.004 --> 00:57:47.340
I come here to ask for your help,

00:57:47.423 --> 00:57:48.675
to raise an army.

00:57:48.758 --> 00:57:50.718
There's a maniac called the God Butcher

00:57:50.802 --> 00:57:52.095
who seeks to end us all.

00:57:52.178 --> 00:57:53.638
His destruction is everywhere.

00:57:53.805 --> 00:57:55.807
Entire planets, realms

00:57:55.974 --> 00:57:57.517
have been left completely unprotected.

00:57:57.600 --> 00:57:59.727
He's left nothing but chaos in his wake.

00:57:59.811 --> 00:58:01.813
But I know where he is,

00:58:01.896 --> 00:58:03.148
and with your help,

00:58:03.231 --> 00:58:06.025
we can crush him
before he kills anyone else.

00:58:06.151 --> 00:58:07.819
That guy,

00:58:07.902 --> 00:58:10.905
he killed a couple of low-level god.

00:58:10.989 --> 00:58:12.198
Eh. Boo-hoo.

00:58:12.282 --> 00:58:13.825
If that's all,

00:58:13.908 --> 00:58:15.034
pretty boy...

00:58:15.118 --> 00:58:16.911
...you go back to your seat
and you be quiet.

00:58:16.995 --> 00:58:18.913
Yeah, I'm sorry. Did you not hear

00:58:18.997 --> 00:58:20.123
any of what I just said?

00:58:20.206 --> 00:58:22.208
He's... He's murdering en masse.

00:58:22.292 --> 00:58:24.460
I tell you one time,

00:58:24.544 --> 00:58:25.628
now, you shut up.

00:58:25.712 --> 00:58:26.796
You be quiet.

00:58:26.880 --> 00:58:29.716
Because you are this close to
being uninvited to the orgy.

00:58:29.799 --> 00:58:32.051
Zeus, we must do something.

00:58:32.135 --> 00:58:34.012
You cannot come to the orgy!

00:58:34.095 --> 00:58:36.097
- You have to listen to us!
- That's it!

00:58:36.181 --> 00:58:37.640
Shackle!

00:58:40.226 --> 00:58:41.811
Your Highness,
whenever you're ready, you just tell me.

00:58:41.936 --> 00:58:43.062
- We go on my signal.
- Mm-hmm.

00:58:43.146 --> 00:58:44.272
What is the signal?

00:58:44.355 --> 00:58:45.773
- It'll be, "Go."
- Hmm.

00:58:49.611 --> 00:58:50.862
Let's see who you are.

00:58:50.945 --> 00:58:52.614
I take off your disguise.

00:58:52.697 --> 00:58:53.740
And flick!

00:59:01.998 --> 00:59:03.708
You flicked too hard, damn it!

00:59:06.169 --> 00:59:08.379
Should we help him?

00:59:08.546 --> 00:59:09.881
I mean, eventually.

00:59:09.964 --> 00:59:11.090
Grape?

00:59:11.174 --> 00:59:12.926
Mm, looks like a shy courgette.

00:59:13.009 --> 00:59:14.969
And what about the others?

00:59:15.053 --> 00:59:16.137
We take off their disguise too.

00:59:16.221 --> 00:59:17.513
Oh, no. No. Don't flick us.

00:59:17.597 --> 00:59:18.681
It's cool.

00:59:18.765 --> 00:59:20.266
Uh... Disguise gone!

00:59:20.350 --> 00:59:21.351
Disguise off. Cool?

00:59:21.434 --> 00:59:22.727
Asgardians.

00:59:22.810 --> 00:59:25.688
I thought we'd seen the last
of you when Odin died.

00:59:27.232 --> 00:59:29.525
You are Thor,

00:59:29.901 --> 00:59:31.486
the God of Thunder.

00:59:32.237 --> 00:59:35.448
But is not thunder
just the sound of lightning?

00:59:37.784 --> 00:59:38.952
Good one, Dad.

00:59:39.035 --> 00:59:40.328
Zeus, this is bigger than us.

00:59:40.411 --> 00:59:42.497
He's taken Asgardian children.

00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:45.917
Who do you think we are? The god police?

00:59:46.793 --> 00:59:49.754
Every god watches over
their own peoples.

00:59:50.255 --> 00:59:52.799
Nothing more, nothing less.

00:59:52.966 --> 00:59:54.634
Asgardian problems

00:59:55.551 --> 00:59:58.263
are Asgardian problems. Hmm?

00:59:58.346 --> 01:00:00.348
How the mighty have fallen.

01:00:00.515 --> 01:00:02.684
My hero, Zeus,

01:00:02.850 --> 01:00:03.851
afraid.

01:00:16.155 --> 01:00:18.032
Couple of thing.

01:00:18.116 --> 01:00:21.077
One, yes, I am scared.

01:00:21.661 --> 01:00:23.955
Gorr has the Necrosword,

01:00:24.122 --> 01:00:26.249
which means he could kill us.

01:00:26.791 --> 01:00:28.167
Not good. Two,

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:30.253
I know you're trying
to do the right thing.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:31.671
I understand.

01:00:31.754 --> 01:00:33.965
But all you do is cause a panic.

01:00:34.048 --> 01:00:36.092
Panic is not good.

01:00:36.259 --> 01:00:37.760
We are safe here.

01:00:37.927 --> 01:00:40.305
You, my friend, you are safe here.

01:00:40.847 --> 01:00:42.515
So, chill, baby cake.

01:00:42.974 --> 01:00:45.226
Have some wine, have some grape.

01:00:45.310 --> 01:00:46.853
Anything goes here

01:00:46.936 --> 01:00:49.272
in Omnipotence City. Hmm.

01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:52.483
Three, don't talk back to Zeus.

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:55.028
I flicked too hard.
I put your clothes back on.

01:00:56.779 --> 01:00:58.114
Now I put your clothes back on!

01:00:58.197 --> 01:00:59.157
Flick, flick.

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:00.742
For this is the Golden Temple

01:01:00.825 --> 01:01:02.076
of the god.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:04.954
It's not a rudie-nudie festival.

01:01:05.038 --> 01:01:06.205
If you're not gonna help us,

01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:07.915
then at least let us use your weapon.

01:01:07.999 --> 01:01:09.417
We need your lightning bolt.

01:01:10.043 --> 01:01:12.295
My lightning bolt is called Thunderbolt.

01:01:12.378 --> 01:01:15.673
So, I think, to use somebody's
secret weapon like this,

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.384
that you should at least get
the name right when you ask.

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.720
Can I borrow Thunderbolt?

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:22.722
Thunderbolt!

01:01:49.248 --> 01:01:50.083
No!

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.838
Do not worry.

01:01:56.506 --> 01:01:58.216
The God Butcher,

01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:00.802
he will not reach Eternity.

01:02:00.885 --> 01:02:02.178
Eternity?

01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:04.055
What does he mean, reach Eternity?

01:02:07.475 --> 01:02:09.310
Oh, shit.

01:02:11.854 --> 01:02:14.774
Eternity is a very powerful being

01:02:14.857 --> 01:02:16.317
at the centre of the universe.

01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:18.152
It will grant the desire

01:02:18.236 --> 01:02:20.071
of the first person who reaches it.

01:02:20.238 --> 01:02:22.073
So, it's like a wishing well?

01:02:24.534 --> 01:02:26.244
What do you think a guy
called the God Butcher

01:02:26.327 --> 01:02:27.412
would wish for?

01:02:27.495 --> 01:02:28.663
If he seeks the Altar of Eternity,

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:30.373
that means he could wipe us out at once.

01:02:30.456 --> 01:02:32.125
Zeus, we must act now.

01:02:32.291 --> 01:02:34.043
He's not going to make it.

01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:35.503
He doesn't have the key.

01:02:36.087 --> 01:02:37.839
Is this the purpose of the gods?

01:02:38.005 --> 01:02:40.800
To hide away in a golden
palace like cowards?

01:02:40.883 --> 01:02:42.885
Maybe we have lost our way.

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:45.012
You know what? We'll stop him ourselves.

01:02:45.096 --> 01:02:47.223
I am afraid I cannot allow that.

01:02:47.598 --> 01:02:49.934
This is a secret place

01:02:50.101 --> 01:02:51.894
known only to the gods.

01:02:51.978 --> 01:02:54.021
You know where we are.

01:02:54.188 --> 01:02:57.775
The God Butcher could use you
to find us.

01:02:58.568 --> 01:02:59.861
This is no good.

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:02.029
So now,

01:03:03.281 --> 01:03:04.782
you must stay.

01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:07.160
Guards!

01:03:09.704 --> 01:03:10.955
Hey.

01:03:11.038 --> 01:03:11.914
Can we do my plan now?

01:03:11.998 --> 01:03:13.916
Yes. Rush his bum.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.376
Hell, yeah!

01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:19.672
Oh, you didn't say, "Go."

01:03:23.801 --> 01:03:25.511
Coming, guys!

01:03:35.771 --> 01:03:36.772
Thor, catch!

01:03:39.942 --> 01:03:40.943
Korg!

01:04:00.379 --> 01:04:01.506
Val, duck!

01:04:06.969 --> 01:04:07.970
Korg!

01:04:10.223 --> 01:04:11.599
Thor.

01:04:12.225 --> 01:04:14.769
Oh, no. No. Korg!

01:04:15.478 --> 01:04:18.898
Thor, I'm... I'm perishing!

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:24.820
Zeus!

01:04:26.906 --> 01:04:28.366
You're next, Odinson!

01:04:36.165 --> 01:04:38.376
That's the sound of lightning.

01:04:45.591 --> 01:04:46.759
No!

01:04:47.301 --> 01:04:48.302
Korgi.

01:04:48.386 --> 01:04:49.554
Korgi!

01:04:49.637 --> 01:04:50.680
Thor.

01:04:50.763 --> 01:04:52.306
- Korgi?
- I'm down here.

01:04:52.390 --> 01:04:53.474
Where? Where are you?

01:04:53.558 --> 01:04:54.642
I'm gonna get you out. It's okay.

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:56.185
- Korg. Korgi!
- Here I am!

01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:57.270
I didn't die!

01:04:57.353 --> 01:04:59.564
Oh, my God. Yes! You're alive!

01:04:59.647 --> 01:05:01.190
Turns out the only part
of a Kronan that's alive

01:05:01.274 --> 01:05:02.275
is his mouth.

01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:04.694
Korgi, listen.
I need you to call the goats.

01:05:04.777 --> 01:05:05.778
I'll do my best.

01:05:05.861 --> 01:05:07.154
Guard him with your life.

01:05:07.238 --> 01:05:09.240
I will. Ready to go for a ride?

01:05:13.703 --> 01:05:14.870
Now you've got my six.

01:05:15.496 --> 01:05:16.581
Eight o'clock, Val.

01:05:16.664 --> 01:05:18.583
7:48.

01:05:19.709 --> 01:05:22.044
I can do this, damn it.

01:05:22.128 --> 01:05:23.421
No, that's not it.
No, that's not it.

01:05:23.504 --> 01:05:24.547
Nope.

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:27.216
Come on, Korg,
purse those lips.

01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:41.939
I did it!

01:06:19.727 --> 01:06:22.021
And then the goat boat came in,
rescued us,

01:06:22.104 --> 01:06:23.522
and we flew out the window.

01:06:23.606 --> 01:06:24.732
The end.

01:06:24.815 --> 01:06:26.359
Another classic Thor adventure.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:28.569
I can't believe you killed Zeus.

01:06:28.653 --> 01:06:31.864
Well, you know what they say,
never meet your heroes.

01:06:33.407 --> 01:06:34.367
But what's important

01:06:34.450 --> 01:06:36.327
is we are on our way to you right now.

01:06:36.410 --> 01:06:37.828
How are you guys doing? Are you okay?

01:06:37.912 --> 01:06:39.622
We're all right. A little scared.

01:06:39.705 --> 01:06:41.749
Well, listen, I know
what it's like to be scared.

01:06:41.916 --> 01:06:43.501
And I'll tell you, when I was your age,

01:06:43.668 --> 01:06:45.419
I don't think I would have
been as brave as you.

01:06:45.503 --> 01:06:46.462
Really?

01:06:46.545 --> 01:06:47.630
In fact, might just be

01:06:47.713 --> 01:06:49.465
the bravest Asgardians
that I've ever met.

01:06:49.548 --> 01:06:50.883
All of you.

01:06:50.966 --> 01:06:52.885
So I need you to
keep being brave, all right?

01:06:53.010 --> 01:06:55.179
And take care of each other.
You're a team now.

01:06:55.262 --> 01:06:56.764
Team Kids in a Cage.

01:06:58.432 --> 01:06:59.433
Can you do that?

01:07:00.017 --> 01:07:02.186
Yeah. I think we can do that.

01:07:02.937 --> 01:07:03.938
I know you can.

01:07:06.607 --> 01:07:08.401
Right?

01:07:08.901 --> 01:07:10.236
- Thor?
- Yeah.

01:07:10.319 --> 01:07:11.904
I'm glad I met my hero.

01:07:11.987 --> 01:07:13.698
Oh, thanks, buddy.

01:07:17.702 --> 01:07:18.953
How are the children?

01:07:19.036 --> 01:07:20.454
As you can imagine,
they're a little bit scared

01:07:20.538 --> 01:07:21.539
because they're kids,

01:07:21.622 --> 01:07:23.040
but I told them that
everything is going to plan.

01:07:23.124 --> 01:07:25.084
- Oh, so you lied to them?
- We still have a plan?

01:07:25.167 --> 01:07:26.377
- Yes, there's a plan.
- There's no plan.

01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:28.504
- There is a plan.
- No. There's no plan.

01:07:28.671 --> 01:07:30.715
We failed to raise a god army,

01:07:30.881 --> 01:07:31.924
Korg is dead.

01:07:32.007 --> 01:07:33.300
- He's not dead.
- I'm not dead.

01:07:33.384 --> 01:07:34.760
Well, he's a head. And you,

01:07:34.844 --> 01:07:36.345
you got properly humiliated.

01:07:36.429 --> 01:07:38.764
No, I got properly naked,
which I am okay with.

01:07:38.931 --> 01:07:40.641
- Jane?
- I was okay with it.

01:07:40.725 --> 01:07:41.809
- Korg?
- I loved it.

01:07:41.934 --> 01:07:43.853
The point is, we are going
into the Shadow Realm

01:07:43.936 --> 01:07:45.229
weaker than we were before.

01:07:45.396 --> 01:07:46.605
I mean, we're gonna die.

01:07:46.689 --> 01:07:48.315
- No one's gonna die, okay?
- Really?

01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:50.735
Everything is fine.
We did great back there.

01:07:50.901 --> 01:07:52.820
- We killed Zeus!
- You killed Zeus.

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.447
I mean, that may
or may not be catastrophic

01:07:54.530 --> 01:07:55.906
for the whole universe,

01:07:55.990 --> 01:07:58.033
and, sure, the entire
god kingdom is probably going

01:07:58.117 --> 01:07:59.577
to hunt us down
for the rest of our days,

01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.163
but listen,
you stole this beautiful weapon.

01:08:02.329 --> 01:08:04.206
All right? This is the army right here.

01:08:04.373 --> 01:08:05.833
It's sleek, it's slender,

01:08:05.916 --> 01:08:07.418
it's powerful, it's beautiful...

01:08:09.336 --> 01:08:11.338
Ah, for you.
I love it for you, Valkyrie.

01:08:11.422 --> 01:08:13.048
I mean, it's not really what I'm into

01:08:13.132 --> 01:08:15.009
'cause I've got my weapon out there.

01:08:15.176 --> 01:08:16.802
Can I borrow that for a second?

01:08:19.764 --> 01:08:22.057
Ah, there you are, old friend.

01:08:22.475 --> 01:08:24.935
That was quite an entrance back there.

01:08:30.691 --> 01:08:31.942
Listen, uh,

01:08:32.026 --> 01:08:33.360
are we good?

01:08:33.694 --> 01:08:34.695
Yeah?

01:08:34.779 --> 01:08:35.780
I mean, I know it's a little weird

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:37.239
having my ex-weapon around,

01:08:37.990 --> 01:08:39.909
but come on, Mjolnir, in the past.

01:08:40.242 --> 01:08:41.744
It's you and me now, buddy.

01:08:41.827 --> 01:08:43.245
You know what?

01:08:43.412 --> 01:08:46.040
I think it's time for your first beer.
What do you say?

01:08:51.545 --> 01:08:53.005
Delicious.

01:08:53.088 --> 01:08:55.299
Hmm.
I'm sorry we've been fighting lately.

01:09:03.307 --> 01:09:04.308
Hey.

01:09:04.725 --> 01:09:05.726
Oh, hey.

01:09:08.521 --> 01:09:10.856
It's quite the view, huh?

01:09:10.940 --> 01:09:12.024
Yeah. Beautiful.

01:09:12.107 --> 01:09:14.235
I just want to say
that was very, very impressive

01:09:14.318 --> 01:09:15.778
what you did back there.

01:09:16.487 --> 01:09:18.364
You and Mjolnir, you know.

01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:21.951
Yeah.

01:09:24.578 --> 01:09:26.372
- Space dolphins.
- What?

01:09:26.455 --> 01:09:28.791
You should see
some space dolphins...

01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:30.417
What?

01:09:30.501 --> 01:09:32.169
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

01:09:32.253 --> 01:09:34.505
Beautiful. Wow.

01:09:34.588 --> 01:09:36.048
So beautiful. So rare.

01:09:36.215 --> 01:09:37.424
Very loyal creatures.

01:09:37.508 --> 01:09:40.219
They mate for life, in packs of six.

01:09:40.302 --> 01:09:42.054
Just love.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.074
That is the song that my dad sang

01:10:02.157 --> 01:10:03.784
to my other dad when they were courting.

01:10:03.951 --> 01:10:05.411
When two Kronans wanna make a baby,

01:10:05.494 --> 01:10:06.871
they get together inside a mountain,

01:10:07.037 --> 01:10:08.789
and they go down to a little lava pool,

01:10:08.873 --> 01:10:10.499
and they hold hands over the hot lava,

01:10:10.666 --> 01:10:12.918
and then, after a month,
they pull their hands apart

01:10:13.002 --> 01:10:14.086
and they find they've created

01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:16.088
a beautiful new Kronan baby boy.

01:10:16.171 --> 01:10:18.465
Mm, fascinating. And hot.

01:10:18.549 --> 01:10:19.967
Did you ever have a special someone?

01:10:20.050 --> 01:10:22.928
I've had
so many special someones.

01:10:23.012 --> 01:10:25.306
But I don't know...

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:27.725
I don't know if I want that again.

01:10:27.808 --> 01:10:29.184
Is that because you lost
your girlfriend in battle

01:10:29.268 --> 01:10:30.519
and never forgave yourself?

01:10:30.603 --> 01:10:31.645
And now, you're just trying

01:10:31.729 --> 01:10:33.105
to find answers
in the bottom of a bottle,

01:10:33.272 --> 01:10:34.773
or some meaningless dalliance,

01:10:34.857 --> 01:10:36.191
which only serves to numb the pain

01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:37.359
instead of bringing you

01:10:37.443 --> 01:10:38.903
real happiness or satisfaction?

01:10:39.069 --> 01:10:42.448
- Yeah. Something like that.
- Hmm.

01:10:44.199 --> 01:10:47.077
Beautiful. Beautiful things.

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.374
Jane.

01:10:52.833 --> 01:10:53.834
Thor.

01:10:53.918 --> 01:10:55.294
I wanna feel shitty about you.

01:10:55.377 --> 01:10:56.462
What?

01:11:00.466 --> 01:11:02.593
I wanna feel shitty about something

01:11:02.676 --> 01:11:04.178
and I think that's you.

01:11:04.261 --> 01:11:05.304
Not really getting any better.

01:11:05.387 --> 01:11:06.972
It's not, is it? Damn it.

01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:08.515
I wanna...

01:11:08.599 --> 01:11:11.268
My friend, he told me that
it's better to feel shitty

01:11:12.561 --> 01:11:14.480
from losing love than it is
to never experience love

01:11:14.563 --> 01:11:16.065
and to feel nothing at all,
to feel empty,

01:11:16.148 --> 01:11:17.316
and I think he was right,

01:11:18.192 --> 01:11:20.611
which is how I've been feeling
for a long time.

01:11:20.778 --> 01:11:23.072
I've pushed people away,
kept them at a distance

01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:24.531
because of the fear of that loss,

01:11:24.615 --> 01:11:25.491
but I don't wanna do that anymore.

01:11:25.574 --> 01:11:26.825
I don't wanna live like that.

01:11:26.909 --> 01:11:28.619
Better to close off your heart
than feel the pain.

01:11:28.702 --> 01:11:30.871
That's what I did, yes.
I closed off my heart

01:11:30.955 --> 01:11:32.831
and... and I meditated. Did you meditate?

01:11:32.915 --> 01:11:34.208
No. It's so boring.

01:11:34.291 --> 01:11:36.460
It actually made me more angry.

01:11:36.961 --> 01:11:39.672
But I'm tired of giving myself
over to the idea of fate

01:11:39.755 --> 01:11:41.632
and trying to figure out what
the universe wants from me.

01:11:41.715 --> 01:11:43.092
I wanna live in the moment,

01:11:43.175 --> 01:11:44.551
I wanna live like there's no tomorrow,

01:11:44.635 --> 01:11:45.886
throw caution to the wind. I want...

01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:48.013
- I wanna be with you, Jane.
- Ah.

01:11:48.889 --> 01:11:49.723
What do you say?

01:11:50.557 --> 01:11:52.309
I have cancer.

01:11:54.687 --> 01:11:55.729
I'm sorry, what?

01:11:56.313 --> 01:11:57.356
I'm sick.

01:11:57.439 --> 01:11:59.108
- Wait. What's happening?
- Bye.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:01.485
- Uh...
- No, no, no. Jane, Jane, Jane.

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:02.861
- Wait, wait, wait. Jane.
- What did I say?

01:12:02.945 --> 01:12:04.863
I didn't mean that. Just kidding.

01:12:04.947 --> 01:12:05.948
I...

01:12:06.490 --> 01:12:08.117
don't have cancer.

01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:09.660
Let's go smash something.

01:12:10.411 --> 01:12:11.453
Jane, I'm so sorry.

01:12:11.537 --> 01:12:13.539
Don't be sorry for me.

01:12:15.124 --> 01:12:16.625
When did you find out?

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:18.711
Um...

01:12:18.794 --> 01:12:20.587
Like six months ago.

01:12:20.754 --> 01:12:22.840
I was just feeling tired, and then

01:12:22.923 --> 01:12:24.550
they told me I have Stage Four.

01:12:24.717 --> 01:12:26.427
Get my affairs in order.

01:12:27.261 --> 01:12:29.680
And then I heard Mjolnir calling me,

01:12:30.389 --> 01:12:32.933
so I thought maybe,
if science isn't working,

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:37.187
maybe Viking space magic.

01:12:37.271 --> 01:12:38.814
That's why you came to New Asgard.

01:12:38.897 --> 01:12:41.775
Yeah, I thought the hammer
maybe could cure me,

01:12:41.942 --> 01:12:44.862
and I think it's getting better.

01:12:45.529 --> 01:12:46.989
Maybe not.

01:12:48.032 --> 01:12:50.242
Jane, none of us know how long we have.

01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:52.661
We don't know what tomorrow holds.

01:12:52.828 --> 01:12:53.829
And Mjolnir...

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:55.497
Mjolnir chose you.

01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:58.208
And it chose you because you're worthy.

01:12:58.375 --> 01:12:59.626
And that's something.

01:12:59.793 --> 01:13:01.003
When I first met you,

01:13:01.587 --> 01:13:02.588
I was unworthy.

01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:04.214
I was unable to pick up that hammer.

01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:06.258
But you taught me

01:13:06.425 --> 01:13:09.386
there is no greater purpose
than to help those in need.

01:13:10.137 --> 01:13:12.222
You made me worthy.

01:13:13.682 --> 01:13:15.851
So whatever you wanna do,
we can do together.

01:13:18.062 --> 01:13:19.104
Okay.

01:13:19.188 --> 01:13:20.981
Now what do you wanna do?

01:13:22.107 --> 01:13:24.777
I wanna get those children
back to their families.

01:13:24.943 --> 01:13:26.236
I wanna finish that mission.

01:13:27.404 --> 01:13:29.031
- Spoken like a true Thor.
- Hmm.

01:13:30.616 --> 01:13:31.992
How do you feel now?

01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:34.286
So scared.

01:13:35.579 --> 01:13:36.538
How are you feeling?

01:13:36.705 --> 01:13:37.998
Shitty.

01:13:38.082 --> 01:13:39.041
How shitty?

01:13:39.124 --> 01:13:40.751
- Really shitty.
- Well, then...

01:13:51.887 --> 01:13:53.972
I wonder what those two
are talking about out there.

01:13:54.556 --> 01:13:57.101
- Yeah, they're not talking.
- Oh!

01:13:58.393 --> 01:14:00.062
Do you think those two
will ever hold hands

01:14:00.145 --> 01:14:02.898
over a hot lava pool
and make a Thor baby?

01:14:04.691 --> 01:14:06.860
It's unlikely, sadly.

01:14:06.944 --> 01:14:08.654
Mm, that's too bad.

01:14:08.737 --> 01:14:10.197
I think Thor would make a great dad.

01:14:13.784 --> 01:14:14.785
Hey. We're here.

01:14:23.710 --> 01:14:25.295
Where did all the colour go?

01:14:58.579 --> 01:14:59.997
They're not here.

01:15:05.586 --> 01:15:06.628
Where are they?

01:15:25.772 --> 01:15:27.566
What the hell is this place?

01:15:55.886 --> 01:15:57.971
Bifrost is the key?

01:16:07.189 --> 01:16:08.607
It's a trap!

01:16:25.916 --> 01:16:27.125
You wanna tell me
why you just threw

01:16:27.209 --> 01:16:28.377
Stormbreaker out the window?

01:16:28.543 --> 01:16:30.671
He needs it to open
the Gates of Eternity.

01:17:01.994 --> 01:17:03.662
We really have to
stop meeting like this.

01:17:03.745 --> 01:17:04.871
Call the axe.

01:17:04.955 --> 01:17:06.540
I'll call the axe
when you call the dentist.

01:17:06.623 --> 01:17:09.334
Call the axe.

01:17:09.418 --> 01:17:11.920
Tell me where the children are
or I'm gonna kill you.

01:17:18.468 --> 01:17:19.970
Call the axe.

01:17:27.144 --> 01:17:29.021
Some god you are.

01:17:29.855 --> 01:17:33.233
You know nothing of being a god.

01:17:35.694 --> 01:17:40.449
You went to the gods for help,
and they did nothing.

01:17:40.532 --> 01:17:43.368
We're alike in that sense.

01:17:43.452 --> 01:17:45.037
He's nothing like you.

01:17:45.120 --> 01:17:46.621
What was that?

01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:51.585
I said he's nothing like you.

01:17:51.752 --> 01:17:53.128
That's right.

01:17:53.295 --> 01:17:57.758
I'm not a hypocrite.
I'm truly creating peace.

01:17:57.841 --> 01:17:59.676
Peace? You're murdering innocent gods.

01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:00.886
Innocent?

01:18:01.928 --> 01:18:03.055
Are you a Valkyrie?

01:18:03.138 --> 01:18:04.139
Yes.

01:18:04.222 --> 01:18:06.808
How exciting!

01:18:07.934 --> 01:18:10.937
Oh, the gods failed you, too,

01:18:11.271 --> 01:18:15.150
when your sisterhood
was led to slaughter.

01:18:15.233 --> 01:18:16.318
Don't you dare speak...

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:19.237
Did you pray to the gods

01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:23.533
when the women you loved
laid dying on the battlefield?

01:18:25.327 --> 01:18:27.454
Did you beg them for help

01:18:28.121 --> 01:18:30.248
as your family was massacred?

01:18:32.918 --> 01:18:34.127
Good chat.

01:18:37.589 --> 01:18:39.132
This one.

01:18:39.216 --> 01:18:41.385
You're interesting.

01:18:42.552 --> 01:18:44.054
You're different.

01:18:44.679 --> 01:18:45.889
Yes.

01:18:48.475 --> 01:18:50.602
Aw.

01:18:54.231 --> 01:18:55.565
You're dying.

01:18:57.317 --> 01:18:58.610
I'm sorry.

01:18:59.653 --> 01:19:01.613
We're on the same path.

01:19:03.865 --> 01:19:07.160
Just as the sword empowered me,

01:19:07.828 --> 01:19:09.955
the hammer empowered you.

01:19:10.914 --> 01:19:13.625
But it did nothing to change your fate.

01:19:14.626 --> 01:19:17.754
The gods will use you,

01:19:18.630 --> 01:19:21.425
but they will not help you.

01:19:22.008 --> 01:19:26.930
There is no eternal reward for us.

01:19:33.645 --> 01:19:35.063
She'll be gone soon.

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:38.650
And you know who won't help her?

01:19:38.733 --> 01:19:40.569
I'll give you one guess.

01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:53.165
I know your pain.

01:19:53.248 --> 01:19:55.333
Love is pain.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:02.299
I had a daughter once.

01:20:03.133 --> 01:20:05.093
I put my faith in a higher power

01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.971
hoping it would save her,

01:20:08.138 --> 01:20:09.806
and she...

01:20:11.016 --> 01:20:12.726
died.

01:20:16.771 --> 01:20:18.940
Now I understand.

01:20:19.024 --> 01:20:21.276
My daughter is the lucky one.

01:20:21.902 --> 01:20:27.115
She does not have to grow up
in a world of suffering

01:20:27.282 --> 01:20:28.783
and pain

01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:33.205
run by wicked gods.

01:20:35.081 --> 01:20:37.250
Choose love.

01:20:38.376 --> 01:20:41.838
Call the axe.

01:20:50.514 --> 01:20:52.557
Call

01:20:52.933 --> 01:20:54.434
the axe.

01:21:30.637 --> 01:21:31.888
You okay?

01:21:32.055 --> 01:21:33.223
Yeah.

01:21:35.850 --> 01:21:37.143
Mm, I wanna kill this guy.

01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:39.771
So do I, but we have to take him alive.

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:42.023
He's our only link
to finding those children.

01:22:56.014 --> 01:22:57.641
Oh! Thank you, Mr Goat.

01:23:29.506 --> 01:23:31.549
Val!

01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:44.062
We gotta get her out of here!

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:55.115
Hey. I got you.

01:24:05.917 --> 01:24:08.086
Hey, guys, we're here.
Come on, let's go.

01:24:08.169 --> 01:24:10.338
Stormbreaker, take us home.

01:25:05.769 --> 01:25:08.021
...at a rate that
none of us have seen before.

01:25:08.104 --> 01:25:09.606
Look, there are other more

01:25:09.689 --> 01:25:11.566
aggressive forms of treatment
we can try,

01:25:11.649 --> 01:25:12.734
but something's affecting

01:25:12.817 --> 01:25:14.778
her body's ability to fight the cancer.

01:25:15.612 --> 01:25:17.238
I'm sorry, Thor.

01:25:31.044 --> 01:25:32.921
Oh, there you are. Okay.

01:25:33.004 --> 01:25:34.130
What's goin' on out there?

01:25:34.214 --> 01:25:36.174
Oh, some moron made
a fridge without a door.

01:25:36.257 --> 01:25:37.258
Can you believe it?

01:25:37.342 --> 01:25:38.384
Not to worry. Got it open

01:25:38.468 --> 01:25:40.303
and got you all sorts of goodies.

01:25:40.470 --> 01:25:41.596
How's Val?

01:25:41.679 --> 01:25:44.098
Oh, she's in a lot of pain,
uh, but she is stable.

01:25:44.182 --> 01:25:45.308
Okay, good.

01:25:45.391 --> 01:25:48.311
Now you just gotta get this out of my...

01:25:48.394 --> 01:25:49.938
Oh, no, no, no.
That's gotta stay in there.

01:25:50.021 --> 01:25:51.898
That's all the magic potions and elixirs

01:25:51.981 --> 01:25:53.233
doing their thing, so...

01:25:53.316 --> 01:25:54.943
I'm just gonna pop out for a moment,

01:25:55.026 --> 01:25:56.694
pick up the kids, kill the bad guy,

01:25:56.778 --> 01:25:57.904
and then I'll come straight back.

01:25:58.988 --> 01:26:00.657
You're going without me?

01:26:01.241 --> 01:26:02.325
Uh, yeah.

01:26:02.492 --> 01:26:04.536
What happened to, like,
doing everything together?

01:26:04.619 --> 01:26:06.538
He's gonna use those kids
to distract you.

01:26:06.621 --> 01:26:07.622
You need me.

01:26:07.705 --> 01:26:09.791
I do need you, Jane. I need you alive.

01:26:09.874 --> 01:26:11.751
It'd be great to have you
on the battlefield,

01:26:11.835 --> 01:26:13.419
fighting Gorr side by side,

01:26:13.503 --> 01:26:15.380
but that hammer is killing you.

01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:17.632
Every time you use it,

01:26:17.715 --> 01:26:19.592
it's draining
all of your mortal strength,

01:26:19.759 --> 01:26:22.053
leaving your body
unable to fight the cancer.

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:24.764
What happened to,
"Live like there's no tomorrow"?

01:26:24.848 --> 01:26:26.683
Well, that's before I knew
you might not have one.

01:26:26.850 --> 01:26:28.268
Why not have one more adventure?

01:26:28.476 --> 01:26:30.186
Jane, if there's a chance to live,
you have to take it.

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:33.690
Spoken like a true Thor
who does not have cancer.

01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:39.737
I know I seem like
some cool astrophysicist

01:26:39.821 --> 01:26:41.072
from New Mexico,

01:26:41.155 --> 01:26:43.908
just living the dream, but look at me.

01:26:43.992 --> 01:26:47.871
I wanna keep fighting.
I'm the Mighty Thor.

01:26:47.954 --> 01:26:49.038
And you want me not to do that?

01:26:49.122 --> 01:26:51.875
What's the point of more time of this?

01:26:52.792 --> 01:26:54.460
Because I love you.

01:26:56.546 --> 01:26:58.715
I've always loved you.

01:26:59.674 --> 01:27:01.718
And this is a chance for us.

01:27:02.427 --> 01:27:04.304
But if you pick up
that damn hammer again,

01:27:04.387 --> 01:27:06.097
then that chance is gone.

01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:19.485
It's your choice, Jane.

01:27:20.445 --> 01:27:22.280
But I'd regret it every single day

01:27:22.363 --> 01:27:23.489
if I didn't ask you to stay here

01:27:23.573 --> 01:27:25.533
so we could try and figure
this out together.

01:27:28.661 --> 01:27:30.705
You better come back to me.

01:27:31.456 --> 01:27:33.416
I'm coming back as soon as I can.

01:27:35.919 --> 01:27:38.546
- Break a leg.
- I'll break all his legs.

01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:53.144
Remember that the Gate to Eternity

01:27:53.227 --> 01:27:54.228
is at the literal centre

01:27:54.312 --> 01:27:55.438
- of the universe.
- Universe. Yes.

01:27:55.521 --> 01:27:56.856
If you go past the cluster of comets...

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:57.941
Yes, yes, I know. We've been over this.

01:27:58.024 --> 01:27:59.108
I'm not gonna get lost.

01:27:59.651 --> 01:28:02.320
So how you feeling
with the old stab wound?

01:28:02.403 --> 01:28:03.529
I think I lost my kidney.

01:28:03.613 --> 01:28:05.073
- Gone completely? Ugh.
- Mm.

01:28:05.156 --> 01:28:06.074
I wish I could join you,

01:28:06.157 --> 01:28:07.492
but I'd probably die,

01:28:07.575 --> 01:28:08.993
and that won't help get the kids back,

01:28:09.077 --> 01:28:10.453
so you'll have to go alone.

01:28:10.536 --> 01:28:13.623
All you have to do
is destroy that sword.

01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:14.874
It's his source of power.

01:28:14.958 --> 01:28:16.417
He won't survive long without it.

01:28:18.461 --> 01:28:20.380
Hey. Don't die.

01:28:20.463 --> 01:28:21.923
Yeah, I know.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:17.687
Eternity.

01:29:20.023 --> 01:29:21.274
Finally.

01:29:35.997 --> 01:29:37.415
Come on.

01:30:03.149 --> 01:30:04.150
Hey, kids.

01:30:06.861 --> 01:30:08.154
I knew he'd come.

01:30:08.905 --> 01:30:09.906
Go!

01:30:09.989 --> 01:30:11.074
Go, kids!

01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:22.919
Everyone okay? All right,
gather round. Gather round.

01:30:23.503 --> 01:30:26.130
Good to see you in person, buddy.
Good to see you.

01:30:37.058 --> 01:30:38.476
All right, listen up. Here's the plan.

01:30:38.559 --> 01:30:40.770
We're gonna sneak our way
towards Stormbreaker,

01:30:40.853 --> 01:30:42.438
being very careful not to bump

01:30:42.522 --> 01:30:44.607
into any of those big shadow monsters.

01:30:46.359 --> 01:30:47.485
They're behind me, aren't they?

01:30:53.407 --> 01:30:54.909
Does anyone here have battle experience?

01:30:54.992 --> 01:30:56.160
Battle experience?

01:30:56.244 --> 01:30:58.162
Well, no time to learn like the present.

01:30:58.246 --> 01:31:00.748
We're not strong like you.
We're just kids.

01:31:00.832 --> 01:31:03.292
Hey, don't forget you're Asgardian kids.

01:31:03.376 --> 01:31:05.044
I'm not. I'm just a Lycan kid.

01:31:05.128 --> 01:31:06.671
And I'm a Midassian kid.

01:31:06.754 --> 01:31:08.172
- I'm Falligarian.
- Okay, okay.

01:31:08.256 --> 01:31:10.258
But today, you're Asgardians.

01:31:10.341 --> 01:31:11.676
Now collect your weapons.

01:31:11.759 --> 01:31:12.718
What?

01:31:12.802 --> 01:31:14.887
Go and find anything you can pick up.

01:31:14.971 --> 01:31:16.055
Bring it back here.

01:31:16.139 --> 01:31:17.849
Hurry, hurry!

01:31:17.932 --> 01:31:19.517
Okay, cool. Come on!

01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:22.770
They're getting closer. Hurry up!

01:31:22.854 --> 01:31:24.021
Come on!

01:31:25.231 --> 01:31:28.609
Today is a day
that will go down in history.

01:31:29.569 --> 01:31:31.195
Today is the day they will talk about

01:31:31.279 --> 01:31:32.947
for generations to come.

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:35.491
Today, we are Space Vikings!

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.202
Present arms!

01:31:43.457 --> 01:31:46.169
Whosoever holds these weapons,
and believes in getting home,

01:31:46.252 --> 01:31:49.088
if they be true of heart
is therefore worthy,

01:31:49.255 --> 01:31:50.715
and shall possess,

01:31:51.716 --> 01:31:53.259
for limited time only,

01:31:53.843 --> 01:31:57.680
the power of Thor!

01:32:06.981 --> 01:32:08.232
General Axl...

01:32:10.151 --> 01:32:11.611
...lead your army to that axe.

01:32:12.570 --> 01:32:13.905
We shall do our worst.

01:32:15.406 --> 01:32:16.532
For Asgard.

01:34:12.481 --> 01:34:14.108
Yeah!

01:34:16.402 --> 01:34:17.403
No.

01:34:32.084 --> 01:34:33.169
Jane.

01:34:50.478 --> 01:34:52.021
We destroy that sword and he's dead.

01:34:52.104 --> 01:34:54.231
The gateway's almost open.
You gotta stop Stormbreaker.

01:34:54.815 --> 01:34:56.108
It's okay. I got him.

01:35:04.033 --> 01:35:05.659
Stormbreaker, stop this!

01:35:06.369 --> 01:35:08.037
Get a hold of yourself.
Look what you're doing!

01:35:08.120 --> 01:35:09.538
I'm gonna get you out of there.

01:35:09.622 --> 01:35:11.332
Come on.

01:35:11.415 --> 01:35:13.501
Come on, buddy.

01:35:18.214 --> 01:35:21.592
Let go of my friend.

01:35:25.846 --> 01:35:27.264
You've lost, Lady Thor.

01:35:34.730 --> 01:35:35.689
First off,

01:35:35.773 --> 01:35:38.734
the name is Mighty Thor.

01:35:40.277 --> 01:35:41.445
And secondly,

01:35:41.612 --> 01:35:44.323
if you can't say Mighty Thor,

01:35:44.407 --> 01:35:48.327
I'll accept Doctor Jane Foster.

01:35:52.581 --> 01:35:53.582
And thirdly,

01:35:54.125 --> 01:35:57.169
eat my hammer!

01:36:05.511 --> 01:36:07.596
Stormbreaker!

01:36:11.976 --> 01:36:13.394
I knew you could do it.

01:36:14.562 --> 01:36:16.480
Axl! Get them home!

01:38:05.297 --> 01:38:06.632
Jane?

01:38:06.715 --> 01:38:07.925
I'm okay.

01:38:08.801 --> 01:38:09.802
You have to stop him.

01:38:39.665 --> 01:38:41.292
Gorr! Stop!

01:38:45.921 --> 01:38:48.048
What kind of father would I be

01:38:49.091 --> 01:38:50.217
if I stopped?

01:38:54.388 --> 01:38:57.141
I know your pain,
but this isn't the way.

01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:02.438
It's not death or revenge that you seek.

01:39:05.024 --> 01:39:07.109
What do I seek?

01:39:20.664 --> 01:39:22.082
You seek love.

01:39:25.419 --> 01:39:26.712
Love?

01:39:27.588 --> 01:39:30.382
Why should I seek love?

01:39:30.466 --> 01:39:32.301
Because it's all any of us want.

01:39:34.762 --> 01:39:36.138
How

01:39:36.221 --> 01:39:39.850
dare you turn your back on me?

01:39:41.393 --> 01:39:43.187
You've won, Gorr.

01:39:43.354 --> 01:39:45.189
Why would I spend
my last moments with you

01:39:45.272 --> 01:39:46.732
when I can be with her?

01:39:48.108 --> 01:39:49.610
I choose love.

01:39:49.818 --> 01:39:52.404
You can, too. You can bring her back.

01:39:56.784 --> 01:39:58.285
Make your wish.

01:40:29.483 --> 01:40:30.859
I'm dying.

01:40:32.319 --> 01:40:33.946
She would have no one.

01:40:35.197 --> 01:40:36.990
She would be alone.

01:40:43.872 --> 01:40:46.458
She won't be alone.

01:41:51.106 --> 01:41:52.107
Oh.

01:41:57.070 --> 01:41:58.071
My love.

01:42:07.915 --> 01:42:09.833
I've missed you so much.

01:42:12.711 --> 01:42:14.338
I missed you too.

01:42:18.258 --> 01:42:19.510
I'm so sorry.

01:42:19.593 --> 01:42:20.594
It's okay.

01:42:22.638 --> 01:42:25.265
Ever since I picked up that hammer,

01:42:26.975 --> 01:42:28.018
it's like

01:42:28.769 --> 01:42:30.395
I've gotten an extra life.

01:42:31.688 --> 01:42:33.774
And it was...

01:42:35.734 --> 01:42:36.985
magical.

01:42:39.655 --> 01:42:41.907
Not too bad for a human.

01:42:43.534 --> 01:42:44.910
Not too bad for a god.

01:42:45.661 --> 01:42:49.998
Hey. I think I figured out
my catchphrase.

01:42:50.082 --> 01:42:51.792
- Oh, yeah? What is it?
- Come close...

01:42:57.130 --> 01:42:58.924
It's perfect.

01:42:59.591 --> 01:43:00.717
It's the best one yet.

01:43:00.801 --> 01:43:01.760
Thanks.

01:43:10.269 --> 01:43:12.312
Keep your heart open.

01:43:18.110 --> 01:43:19.319
I love you.

01:43:20.654 --> 01:43:21.780
I love you, too.

01:44:07.784 --> 01:44:08.952
Protect her.

01:44:10.746 --> 01:44:11.830
Protect my love.

01:44:46.114 --> 01:44:49.868
<i>Let me tell you the legend</i>
<i>of the Space Viking,</i>

01:44:50.702 --> 01:44:55.624
<i>AKA the Mighty Thor, AKA Dr Jane Foster.</i>

01:44:58.168 --> 01:45:00.337
<i>Her sacrifice saved the universe</i>

01:45:00.504 --> 01:45:04.341
<i>and taught us all</i>
<i>what it means to be worthy.</i>

01:45:04.925 --> 01:45:06.802
<i>She helped the children of the gods</i>

01:45:06.885 --> 01:45:08.720
<i>who laser-beamed their way back home</i>

01:45:08.804 --> 01:45:11.515
<i>to their dozy little fishing village</i>

01:45:11.598 --> 01:45:13.350
<i>turned tourist destination.</i>

01:45:13.433 --> 01:45:15.644
Axl!

01:45:15.727 --> 01:45:16.979
I missed you.

01:45:17.562 --> 01:45:18.689
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine. I'm okay.

01:45:18.772 --> 01:45:20.065
- Are you sure?
- I'm okay.

01:45:20.148 --> 01:45:21.775
<i>The kids were safe to be kids again.</i>

01:45:21.858 --> 01:45:23.276
Louder, three!

01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:25.821
Widen your stance.

01:45:25.904 --> 01:45:28.031
<i>Especially after</i>
<i>their king made them all go</i>

01:45:28.115 --> 01:45:29.783
<i>to self-defence classes.</i>

01:45:29.866 --> 01:45:31.243
<i>Look at all those budding Space Vikings.</i>

01:45:31.326 --> 01:45:32.452
And the most important part.

01:45:33.203 --> 01:45:34.496
The war cry!

01:45:35.998 --> 01:45:37.332
<i>Even Heimdall's son,</i>

01:45:37.416 --> 01:45:39.167
<i>Axl Heimdallson,</i>

01:45:39.251 --> 01:45:41.545
<i>who could now do</i>
<i>his dad's freaky eye magic,</i>

01:45:41.628 --> 01:45:43.588
<i>was becoming quite the warrior.</i>

01:45:43.672 --> 01:45:46.091
<i>The future of Asgard was secure.</i>

01:45:47.634 --> 01:45:50.595
<i>Speaking of futures,</i>
<i>I was forging one of my own,</i>

01:45:50.762 --> 01:45:52.431
<i>now that my body's grown back,</i>

01:45:53.140 --> 01:45:55.350
<i>with a dude I met called Dwayne.</i>

01:45:57.185 --> 01:45:58.770
<i>And what about Thor, you ask?</i>

01:45:59.521 --> 01:46:01.565
<i>He embarked on a new journey</i>

01:46:01.648 --> 01:46:03.817
<i>because he had found</i>
<i>something to live for,</i>

01:46:03.900 --> 01:46:06.194
<i>something to love for.</i>

01:46:06.319 --> 01:46:07.863
<i>A little someone who turned him</i>

01:46:07.946 --> 01:46:10.824
<i>from Sad God into Dad God.</i>

01:46:10.907 --> 01:46:13.535
Breakfast is served.
Bon appétit.

01:46:13.618 --> 01:46:15.704
Hello. There you go.

01:46:15.787 --> 01:46:16.913
Hey. Breakfast.

01:46:17.706 --> 01:46:20.667
Excuse me. What is that?

01:46:20.751 --> 01:46:22.669
They're pan-flaps. From Earth.

01:46:22.753 --> 01:46:24.671
I don't think I like pan-flaps.

01:46:24.755 --> 01:46:25.922
- You love them.
- No, I don't.

01:46:26.006 --> 01:46:27.924
- Yes, you do.
- I've never had that in my life.

01:46:28.008 --> 01:46:29.676
Come on. Eat up. We have to go.
We're gonna be late.

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.594
Now where are your boots?

01:46:30.677 --> 01:46:32.804
I'm wearing them.

01:46:32.888 --> 01:46:34.431
You're not wearing those.

01:46:34.514 --> 01:46:36.183
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

01:46:36.266 --> 01:46:37.517
Yes, I am.

01:46:37.601 --> 01:46:38.727
No. You're not.

01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:39.936
Go to hell, demon!

01:46:41.897 --> 01:46:42.773
Wow!

01:46:42.856 --> 01:46:45.859
Brand new, now destroyed.
Thank you very much.

01:46:45.942 --> 01:46:48.111
You know what? You wear what you want.

01:46:48.195 --> 01:46:49.196
Don't come complaining to me

01:46:49.279 --> 01:46:50.322
when your feet get sore, all right?

01:46:50.405 --> 01:46:52.157
You'll get no sympathy here from me.

01:46:52.240 --> 01:46:54.326
Fine, I'll wear the boots.

01:46:54.409 --> 01:46:55.243
Thank you.

01:46:55.327 --> 01:46:57.412
Remember what my mother used to tell me.

01:46:57.496 --> 01:46:58.497
Listen to the grown-ups,

01:46:58.580 --> 01:47:00.540
and if you see anyone scared
or being picked on,

01:47:00.624 --> 01:47:02.042
- you look after them, okay?
- Okay.

01:47:02.125 --> 01:47:03.877
And most of all, have fun.

01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:05.420
- Gotcha.
- Gotcha.

01:47:05.504 --> 01:47:07.464
Now where is Mjolnir?
Where did I put him?

01:47:07.547 --> 01:47:08.590
Over there. Sleeping in the bed.

01:47:08.673 --> 01:47:09.925
In the bed.

01:47:11.718 --> 01:47:12.719
Oh, wow.

01:47:15.222 --> 01:47:16.765
That is not coming off.

01:47:17.849 --> 01:47:19.226
What did you do?

01:47:19.309 --> 01:47:21.019
Eh, she looked boring before.

01:47:22.479 --> 01:47:24.064
Yeah. Suppose it did.

01:47:24.147 --> 01:47:25.398
I love it.

01:47:25.482 --> 01:47:26.775
Very creative.

01:47:30.654 --> 01:47:31.655
Okay.

01:47:31.738 --> 01:47:33.532
Now, you see the aliens down there?

01:47:33.615 --> 01:47:35.117
The stripy ones?

01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:36.618
- They look nice.
- Yeah, they are nice.

01:47:36.701 --> 01:47:37.994
That's why we have to look after them.

01:47:38.078 --> 01:47:39.871
Got it. Protect the nice ones.

01:47:40.789 --> 01:47:41.998
I love you, sweetie.

01:47:42.082 --> 01:47:43.416
Love you, Uncle Thor.

01:47:46.461 --> 01:47:48.004
<i>They will always be there for us.</i>

01:47:48.088 --> 01:47:51.383
<i>The Space Viking and his girl,</i>
<i>born from Eternity.</i>

01:47:51.466 --> 01:47:53.760
<i>With the powers of a god.</i>

01:47:56.263 --> 01:47:57.639
<i>Two warriors</i>

01:47:58.140 --> 01:47:59.599
<i>fighting the good fight</i>

01:47:59.683 --> 01:48:01.143
<i>for those who can't fight good.</i>

01:48:07.023 --> 01:48:08.483
<i>They have travelled far,</i>

01:48:08.567 --> 01:48:10.193
<i>and have been given many names.</i>

01:48:11.319 --> 01:48:13.655
<i>But to those who know them best,</i>

01:48:13.738 --> 01:48:15.448
<i>they are simply known</i>

01:48:15.532 --> 01:48:17.367
<i>as Love and Thunder.</i>

01:50:05.433 --> 01:50:08.061
It used to be that being a god,

01:50:08.144 --> 01:50:09.562
it meant something.

01:50:11.356 --> 01:50:12.983
People would whisper your name

01:50:13.984 --> 01:50:17.487
before sharing their deepest
hopes and dreams.

01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:20.907
They begged you for mercy

01:50:21.908 --> 01:50:24.327
without ever knowing if
you were actually listening.

01:50:27.038 --> 01:50:28.039
Now,

01:50:28.748 --> 01:50:30.500
you know, they look to the sky,

01:50:31.459 --> 01:50:33.336
they don't ask us for lightning.

01:50:34.379 --> 01:50:36.339
They don't ask us for rain.

01:50:37.382 --> 01:50:41.344
They just want to see one of
their so-called superheroes.

01:50:45.015 --> 01:50:47.058
When did we become the joke?

01:50:50.478 --> 01:50:51.479
No.

01:50:52.772 --> 01:50:53.815
No more.

01:50:55.775 --> 01:50:57.944
They will fear us again

01:50:58.695 --> 01:51:01.406
when Thor Odinson falls from the sky.

01:51:04.951 --> 01:51:07.787
Do you understand me, Hercules?

01:51:08.371 --> 01:51:10.832
Do you understand me, my son?

01:51:10.915 --> 01:51:12.709
Yes, Father.

01:57:54.694 --> 01:57:55.695
Huh?

01:58:00.074 --> 01:58:01.075
What?

01:58:01.993 --> 01:58:03.327
Oh. Hey.

01:58:05.037 --> 01:58:06.539
Jane Foster.

01:58:07.415 --> 01:58:08.624
Heimdall.

01:58:09.417 --> 01:58:10.752
I see you're dead now.

01:58:10.835 --> 01:58:12.462
Yeah.

01:58:13.087 --> 01:58:15.089
Thank you for looking after my son.

01:58:16.174 --> 01:58:18.760
You are very welcome here,
to the land of the gods.

01:58:23.473 --> 01:58:25.266
Welcome to Valhalla.
