1
00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:15.775
Ladies.

2
00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.090
Baccarat.

3
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:33.092
Exquisite.

4
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.757
Tihomir.

5
00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.326
Hang up.

6
00:02:09.296 --> 00:02:11.264
Bradley Fine.

7
00:02:16.002 --> 00:02:17.904
I'm honored.

8
00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:19.339
Pleasure's all mine.

9
00:02:20.006 --> 00:02:21.441
Tell me where the bomb is.

10
00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:24.143
10 seconds,
or you're dead.

11
00:02:24.177 --> 00:02:26.379
Interesting.

12
00:02:26.413 --> 00:02:30.217
You see, when my men
and I hid it...

13
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.619
I made sure to erase
any witnesses.

14
00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:37.624
And then I erased the erasers.

15
00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.228
Which means,

16
00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:42.541
I'm now the only one
who knows...

17
00:02:43.263 --> 00:02:45.365
just where that
dangerously compact

18
00:02:45.398 --> 00:02:47.867
and transportable nuke is.

19
00:02:48.701 --> 00:02:49.701
So...

20
00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:56.543
I'd say I have
more than 10 seconds.

21
00:02:56.576 --> 00:02:59.145
Well then, in that case,
I'd say you'd better start...

22
00:03:04.551 --> 00:03:07.186
Oh, fuck!

23
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.223
Oh, my God!
Why did you do that?

24
00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:11.424
I didn't do it on purpose.

25
00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:14.193
There's like a ton
of pollen in here!

26
00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:15.795
Oh, God! Christmas
on a cracker!

27
00:03:15.828 --> 00:03:17.196
Did you take
your medicine?

28
00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.331
I forgot it on the plane.

29
00:03:18.365 --> 00:03:19.699
I told you this morning,

30
00:03:19.732 --> 00:03:21.634
I put extra
in all your jackets!

31
00:03:21.668 --> 00:03:23.002
You did?

32
00:03:23.035 --> 00:03:24.604
Great. Shit! Thanks.

33
00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.573
No, you know what?
That's on me.

34
00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.375
Because I heard you
sniffle a while ago

35
00:03:28.408 --> 00:03:31.077
and I did nothing
with that information.

36
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:32.345
So that's blood
on my hands, really...

37
00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:34.180
Okay. You know what?
You got three coming in.

38
00:03:34.213 --> 00:03:35.815
Get out the
back door now. Move.

39
00:03:43.155 --> 00:03:44.757
Anybody in here?

40
00:03:44.791 --> 00:03:46.993
Yeah, we got one coming
around the corner, now.

41
00:03:49.696 --> 00:03:50.730
Your three guests
are coming out

42
00:03:50.763 --> 00:03:51.964
that door behind you
right now.

43
00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:52.998
Watch your six.

44
00:03:56.235 --> 00:03:57.737
Yahtzee.

45
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.539
Oh, zinger!

46
00:03:59.572 --> 00:04:00.873
I should've brought
more bullets.

47
00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.376
I thought they were
chocolate sprinkles,

48
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.077
which I would eat,
normally, by the fistful...

49
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:06.513
but this tasted like...

50
00:04:06.546 --> 00:04:08.281
There's no other way
to say it, really.

51
00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:10.116
Like a rat's arse.

52
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:12.452
Guys, can you please
keep it down?

53
00:04:12.485 --> 00:04:14.454
Unfortunately, there's
vermin in the ceiling again,

54
00:04:14.487 --> 00:04:16.088
and I hate
to say it, but...

55
00:04:16.122 --> 00:04:18.425
they've pooped
all over your cake.

56
00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.159
- I'm going left?
- No.

57
00:04:20.192 --> 00:04:22.562
I need you to go right
and head down the tunnel.

58
00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.230
You've got one coming
around to your right,

59
00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:25.298
and he's got a swarm
behind him.

60
00:04:25.332 --> 00:04:26.733
That's my girl.

61
00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:27.766
Oh, I don't know.

62
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.284
Watch your back.

63
00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:49.188
Oh, that was
a close one, Fine.

64
00:04:49.221 --> 00:04:50.723
Who's the finest of them all?
You are.

65
00:04:51.524 --> 00:04:53.125
♪ Oh, Bradley, you're so fine

66
00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:54.193
♪ You're so fine,
you blow my mind

67
00:04:54.226 --> 00:04:55.294
♪ Hey, Bradley!

68
00:04:55.328 --> 00:04:56.429
Oh, God, duck!

69
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.402
Nice moves, Fine.

70
00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:03.875
Pilates has been
working out for you.

71
00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:05.271
You noticed?

72
00:05:05.304 --> 00:05:08.074
Yeah, you just seem looser.
Like, in your hips.

73
00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.543
I mean athletically speaking.

74
00:05:10.577 --> 00:05:12.412
I don't know. I guess
you don't seem so awkward.

75
00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:13.546
Shut up!

76
00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.014
Going straight?
No.

77
00:05:15.047 --> 00:05:16.716
Go right up the stairs.

78
00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:17.917
You're gonna find
a little friend

79
00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:18.950
on the first landing.

80
00:05:27.394 --> 00:05:28.628
Thanks for your help.

81
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:29.662
You're clear to the top.

82
00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:30.696
Get moving.

83
00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.300
Oh, my God!
The rats can fly!

84
00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:35.502
Come on, you guys!

85
00:05:36.403 --> 00:05:38.538
All right, Fine.
Stop at the door.

86
00:05:38.571 --> 00:05:40.407
You got a guard approaching.
I'll tell you when.

87
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.442
Wait for it,
Fine. Three...

88
00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:45.044
Two, one. Now!

89
00:05:47.346 --> 00:05:49.416
Oh, dear,
did I forget to knock?

90
00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:58.425
They're clawing at my hair!
I can't see!

91
00:05:58.458 --> 00:05:59.959
What do you mean,
you can't see me?

92
00:05:59.992 --> 00:06:02.429
I'm good. You've got
SUVs approaching.

93
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:05.031
Go to the dock!

94
00:06:05.064 --> 00:06:07.099
Dock. Excellent idea.

95
00:06:07.133 --> 00:06:08.601
Boyanov's boat
is at the end.

96
00:06:29.355 --> 00:06:30.823
Uh... No keys, Coop.

97
00:06:30.857 --> 00:06:32.358
The panel's on the lower left
under the steering wheel.

98
00:06:32.391 --> 00:06:33.893
You can hotwire it.

99
00:06:37.064 --> 00:06:38.064
I can't get to the wires!

100
00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.834
Okay, then stay down
and hold your ears!

101
00:06:40.868 --> 00:06:42.503
How will I hear
your beautiful voice?

102
00:06:42.536 --> 00:06:43.971
Stop being adorable
and get down!

103
00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:49.342
Lock on coordinates
43.16547...

104
00:06:49.376 --> 00:06:51.512
27.94654...

105
00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:52.646
and fire, now.

106
00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:08.929
Whoo!

107
00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.632
Close one!

108
00:07:11.665 --> 00:07:13.501
Nice drone work, Coop!

109
00:07:13.534 --> 00:07:14.702
I could kiss you.

110
00:07:14.735 --> 00:07:16.103
Oh!

111
00:07:16.136 --> 00:07:20.040
Well, I would accept that
with an open mouth.

112
00:07:20.073 --> 00:07:22.476
Soon as I'm back,
dinner is on me.

113
00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.545
Great work, Coop.

114
00:07:24.578 --> 00:07:26.418
Hey, pick up my dry cleaning
for me, would you?

115
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:28.081
Also, get my car.

116
00:07:28.115 --> 00:07:29.617
Oh, sure. No problem.

117
00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:31.251
Oh, and I have to fire
my gardener.

118
00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:32.553
He keeps running over

119
00:07:32.586 --> 00:07:33.821
the sprinkler heads
with the mower.

120
00:07:33.854 --> 00:07:35.255
Can you cut him loose
for me?

121
00:07:35.288 --> 00:07:38.125
Um... Yeah. Oh, yeah, sure.

122
00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:39.793
You kidding?
I'd love it!

123
00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.962
You're the best.

124
00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.230
Smell you later, pal.

125
00:07:43.263 --> 00:07:45.866
God. Poor Jaime.

126
00:07:47.568 --> 00:07:50.203
The thing is,
Jaime, that...

127
00:07:50.237 --> 00:07:51.237
Uh...

128
00:07:51.338 --> 00:07:52.773
Oh!

129
00:07:52.806 --> 00:07:54.608
These are your children?

130
00:07:54.642 --> 00:07:55.676
Your children, here?

131
00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:56.944
Yeah, I have children.

132
00:07:56.977 --> 00:07:59.146
I just have to cover
those eyes.

133
00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:02.482
They're looking
right at me. Um...

134
00:08:02.516 --> 00:08:04.251
Please, don't fire me.

135
00:08:04.284 --> 00:08:05.586
No. Jaime, I would never.

136
00:08:05.619 --> 00:08:07.821
This is more of a review.

137
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:10.924
Oh.

138
00:08:10.958 --> 00:08:12.259
Jaime.

139
00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.562
Yes.

These look delicious.

157
00:10:36.336 --> 00:10:39.106
I don't wanna be critical,
but this is very chewy.

158
00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:41.208
Coop. You're eating
a hand towel.

159
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:52.652
Just cleansing my palette.

160
00:10:52.686 --> 00:10:54.922
Jeez. You had to take me
to such a dump?

161
00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.457
Come on, cheapskate!

162
00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:58.530
Burger King was booked up.

163
00:10:58.859 --> 00:10:59.859
Ha!

164
00:11:01.161 --> 00:11:04.097
Sorry. I'm having dinner
with Gallagher over here.

165
00:11:04.131 --> 00:11:05.131
Guard your fruit!

166
00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.902
You could. You're funny.
Your timing is perfect.

167
00:11:08.936 --> 00:11:11.071
Never as funny as you,
Super Cooper.

168
00:11:11.972 --> 00:11:14.975
To another
successful mission.

169
00:11:15.008 --> 00:11:16.209
Go team.

170
00:11:16.243 --> 00:11:17.344
Go team.

171
00:11:18.979 --> 00:11:20.047
Hey, I've been thinking.

172
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.849
Yeah.

173
00:11:21.882 --> 00:11:24.251
I couldn't do
what I do without you.

174
00:11:24.284 --> 00:11:25.719
And I've been thinking

175
00:11:25.753 --> 00:11:27.654
about doing something
special for you...

176
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:28.756
So...

177
00:11:31.291 --> 00:11:32.292
Good gravy, Fine.

178
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:38.665
Oh. That's...

179
00:11:38.698 --> 00:11:40.233
It's a crazy cupcake!

180
00:11:42.202 --> 00:11:43.670
You love cakes.
Well...

181
00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:45.305
I'm not a big cake...

182
00:11:45.338 --> 00:11:47.707
I make cakes. Yes. I
see the connection.

183
00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:49.476
Now you can wear a cake.

184
00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:52.712
How did you know I don't care
for traditional jewelry?

185
00:11:53.814 --> 00:11:55.883
I can't seem to
stop looking at it...

186
00:11:55.916 --> 00:11:58.618
and it can't
stop looking at me.

187
00:11:58.651 --> 00:12:00.020
Imagine how awkward
it would've been

188
00:12:00.053 --> 00:12:01.922
if it'd been a diamond ring
or something.

189
00:12:02.655 --> 00:12:06.059
Ooh...
Not a diamond ring! No!

190
00:12:06.093 --> 00:12:08.261
I would've had to say,
"I don't want to marry you!"

191
00:12:08.295 --> 00:12:11.031
I don't want
your muscly arms and hands...

192
00:12:12.532 --> 00:12:15.602
rubbing my back with Nivea
for the rest of my life.

193
00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:18.038
And our three kids run in,
you know...

194
00:12:18.071 --> 00:12:19.907
Karen, Tommy and Billy...

195
00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:21.441
and we'd say,
"Get out of here!"

196
00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:24.011
And they'd just all
have that beautiful jaw...

197
00:12:24.044 --> 00:12:26.613
and sky-blue eyes, and a full mouth.
I mean...

198
00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:28.181
no, thank you.

199
00:12:28.215 --> 00:12:30.383
I'll just, you know,
I'll just...

200
00:12:30.417 --> 00:12:32.886
Can you give me a little
jewelry I can actually wear?

201
00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:34.087
Not gonna wear it?

202
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:38.391
Yes. Yeah.
I was just saving it.

203
00:12:38.425 --> 00:12:39.893
Put it on!

204
00:12:39.927 --> 00:12:41.428
Look at that.
Wow, that's a...

205
00:12:41.461 --> 00:12:43.330
That is an adjustable toggle.
Adjustable toggle.

206
00:12:43.363 --> 00:12:46.466
You don't see that
with a lot of jewelry.

207
00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.001
It's so you.
Is it?

208
00:12:48.035 --> 00:12:49.302
Wow, perfect.

209
00:12:50.103 --> 00:12:52.840
Oh... Somebody's jealous.

210
00:12:52.873 --> 00:12:55.408
Seriously, I couldn't do
what I do without you,

211
00:12:55.442 --> 00:12:56.877
in my earpiece.

212
00:12:56.910 --> 00:12:58.111
I could never do
what you do.

213
00:12:58.778 --> 00:12:59.980
Can you imagine me as a spy?

214
00:13:00.413 --> 00:13:02.482
Oh, my God.

215
00:13:02.515 --> 00:13:03.750
Out in the field.
Yeah.

216
00:13:03.783 --> 00:13:05.652
With a gun!
What?

217
00:13:05.685 --> 00:13:07.955
"Hi, terrorists.
Oh, golly!

218
00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:10.824
"Oh, I shot myself!
Whoops!

219
00:13:10.858 --> 00:13:12.893
"I meant to shoot you,
not me!"

220
00:13:12.926 --> 00:13:14.127
That's probably
what I'd say.

221
00:13:14.161 --> 00:13:16.396
"Hey, terrorists,
you better watch out,

222
00:13:16.429 --> 00:13:18.131
"or I'll make you
a chocolate cake.

223
00:13:18.165 --> 00:13:20.525
"Do you like chocolate? Well,
then I'll make you a vanilla."

224
00:13:22.836 --> 00:13:24.537
They would never
let me be a spy.

225
00:13:24.571 --> 00:13:26.706
I can't even
dress like a spy.

226
00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.675
Look at you
and your tailored...

227
00:13:28.708 --> 00:13:30.710
Everything is cut right.

228
00:13:30.743 --> 00:13:33.413
And mine is like a lumpy
pumpkin sack dress.

229
00:13:33.446 --> 00:13:34.948
Oh, come...

230
00:13:34.982 --> 00:13:36.516
It doesn't even have a label.
Does not have a label.

231
00:13:36.549 --> 00:13:37.517
I think my mom made it.

232
00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.052
No, stop.

233
00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:40.687
I should get on my hands
and knees and start scooping.

234
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:42.222
Good God.
Go easy on yourself.

235
00:13:42.255 --> 00:13:43.390
Okay.

236
00:13:43.423 --> 00:13:45.092
We're a perfect team.
That's why we work.

237
00:13:45.125 --> 00:13:46.125
Yeah.

238
00:13:47.327 --> 00:13:48.327
Come here.

239
00:13:49.897 --> 00:13:50.998
Come here. Close.

240
00:13:54.067 --> 00:13:55.568
I think
you're getting pinkeye.

241
00:13:55.602 --> 00:13:57.237
What? No.

242
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:58.838
Right there.
No, that's not...

243
00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:01.008
Did you wipe your eye after
you cleaned out the cat box?

244
00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:02.041
I don't have cats.

245
00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:03.743
Why did I think that?

246
00:14:03.776 --> 00:14:05.045
I don't know.

247
00:14:05.078 --> 00:14:07.014
You should get some.
They're good company.

248
00:14:13.753 --> 00:14:15.722
We've intercepted chatter...

249
00:14:15.755 --> 00:14:17.657
that the weapon is still being
offered to the highest bidder.

250
00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:20.160
Someone other than Boyanov
knows where that nuke is.

251
00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:21.929
It's probably
his daughter, Rayna.

252
00:14:21.962 --> 00:14:24.131
She's really the only
person he's trusted.

253
00:14:24.164 --> 00:14:25.798
Jesus, Cooper,
do you have pinkeye?

254
00:14:25.832 --> 00:14:27.500
Go home. You're going
to infect everybody.

255
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.136
Told you.

256
00:14:29.169 --> 00:14:31.271
No, it's not
pinkeye, ma'am.

257
00:14:31.304 --> 00:14:34.174
It's just I'm having a bit
of an allergic reaction.

258
00:14:34.207 --> 00:14:35.742
Well, I'm allergic
to disgusting

259
00:14:35.775 --> 00:14:37.777
childhood illnesses,
so stay away from me.

260
00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:39.712
Sorry.
Anyway, you're right.

261
00:14:39.746 --> 00:14:41.214
After Boyanov's death,

262
00:14:41.248 --> 00:14:44.417
Rayna went to a safety deposit
box at a DSK bank in Varna.

263
00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:45.718
The chatter picked up
later that night.

264
00:14:45.752 --> 00:14:46.753
What do we know
about her?

265
00:14:46.786 --> 00:14:47.786
I can pull up her file.

266
00:14:49.122 --> 00:14:50.690
Oh, that's stuck.

267
00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.225
It's just a little
warm in here.

268
00:14:53.793 --> 00:14:55.762
Pull up my file...
Jesus! Not my keyboard

269
00:14:55.795 --> 00:14:57.897
with your pinkeye-infected
fingers!

270
00:14:57.931 --> 00:14:59.166
Why don't you
just cry directly

271
00:14:59.199 --> 00:15:00.900
into my mouth
while you're at it?

272
00:15:00.934 --> 00:15:02.869
It really is just
an allergic reaction...

273
00:15:02.902 --> 00:15:04.737
Sit down. I'll do it.

274
00:15:04.771 --> 00:15:06.906
- Okay, I'm gonna go sit down.
- Rayna Boyanov.

275
00:15:06.940 --> 00:15:08.475
Majored in international law
at Oxford.

276
00:15:08.508 --> 00:15:09.909
Top of her class.

277
00:15:09.943 --> 00:15:11.878
Been living in London
for the past 10 years.

278
00:15:11.911 --> 00:15:13.646
We know she has been
communicating

279
00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:15.882
with the heads of several
terrorist organizations.

280
00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.417
Most ominously...

281
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:19.719
Solsa Dudaev,
the al-Qaeda-funded leader

282
00:15:19.752 --> 00:15:21.488
of the Chechen Martyrs'
Brigade.

283
00:15:21.521 --> 00:15:23.790
We have compelling evidence that
he has the machinery in place

284
00:15:23.823 --> 00:15:25.058
to get that nuke
to New York in time

285
00:15:25.092 --> 00:15:26.559
for next week's
UN General Assembly.

286
00:15:26.593 --> 00:15:27.794
I'm already packed.

287
00:15:27.827 --> 00:15:29.096
One of our sources was told

288
00:15:29.129 --> 00:15:30.663
she has taken up residence
outside of Sofia.

289
00:15:30.697 --> 00:15:31.697
Go get her.

290
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.701
Grab my things, Coop.

291
00:15:36.803 --> 00:15:39.439
Jesus, Cooper, go put on
some sunglasses or something.

292
00:15:39.472 --> 00:15:41.674
I feel like you're a Gypsy,
cursing me with it.

293
00:15:41.708 --> 00:15:43.143
Yep, I'm on it.

294
00:15:43.176 --> 00:15:44.611
Yeah, that's all good.
Oh, Fine?

295
00:15:45.678 --> 00:15:47.647
Hi.
Hey, Super Cooper.

296
00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.649
Oh! Um...

297
00:15:49.682 --> 00:15:54.087
I just was feeling
a little weird about...

298
00:15:54.121 --> 00:15:56.489
Oh, yeah? ...some of the stuff,
and I think the intel...

299
00:15:56.523 --> 00:16:00.127
on Rayna's location
seems a little too easy.

300
00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.695
I just...
Something doesn't feel right.

301
00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:04.397
It'll be right when
we get Rayna behind bars

302
00:16:04.431 --> 00:16:06.366
and that nuke
back in our hands.

303
00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:10.603
Yeah, sure. I just...

304
00:16:10.637 --> 00:16:13.640
I don't know. All my alarm bells
are going off with this one.

305
00:16:13.673 --> 00:16:18.678
Really? Well, then, it's
okay 'cause I have a plan.

306
00:16:18.711 --> 00:16:21.581
You and I gotta stop going
on these awful missions.

307
00:16:21.614 --> 00:16:23.016
Run off together.

308
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:24.317
Do you mean that?

309
00:16:24.917 --> 00:16:26.219
What?

310
00:16:26.253 --> 00:16:27.820
What?

311
00:16:27.854 --> 00:16:31.591
Do I mean that?
You got me. You kidder.

312
00:16:31.624 --> 00:16:33.460
You sucker! No.

313
00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:36.396
You should have seen your face!
You were like...

314
00:16:42.135 --> 00:16:45.038
Fine, I'm sorry if I...

315
00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:48.007
Don't be.
God, I admire you.

316
00:16:50.177 --> 00:16:51.844
"I admire you"?

317
00:16:51.878 --> 00:16:54.681
Well, did he at least say it
in a flirty tone that says...

318
00:16:54.714 --> 00:16:58.651
"And because of my admiration, I
shall now take my shirt off...

319
00:16:58.685 --> 00:17:00.887
"and penetrate ye"?
No.

320
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:02.222
The only way he'd
invite me to his bedroom

321
00:17:02.255 --> 00:17:03.756
is if he wants me
to fix his bed.

322
00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:05.425
I'm so stupid.

323
00:17:05.458 --> 00:17:07.178
Can I just have a sip of your wine?
Mmm-hmm.

324
00:17:07.594 --> 00:17:08.594
It's quite buttery.

325
00:17:09.662 --> 00:17:11.964
Wow. Okay, we could
order you your own glass.

326
00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:13.600
That was mine!

327
00:17:13.633 --> 00:17:15.468
My life is a disaster.

328
00:17:15.502 --> 00:17:16.669
No, it's not.

329
00:17:16.703 --> 00:17:18.571
I'm 40, I live by myself...

330
00:17:18.605 --> 00:17:20.207
I haven't been
in a real relationship

331
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.209
since Jerry left me
three years ago.

332
00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:24.010
Well, Jerry was a jackass.

333
00:17:24.043 --> 00:17:25.912
When I gave up teaching
to join the CIA,

334
00:17:25.945 --> 00:17:27.280
I thought everything
was gonna be different.

335
00:17:27.314 --> 00:17:29.249
I thought I was gonna be
this amazing spy.

336
00:17:29.282 --> 00:17:31.084
I'm just the same boring
person I was before.

337
00:17:31.118 --> 00:17:32.352
Well, for what it's worth,

338
00:17:32.385 --> 00:17:33.986
I think you're brilliant
as you are.

339
00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.189
You're exciting. Come
on, let's cheer you up.

340
00:17:36.223 --> 00:17:38.525
Okay. My nephew
loves this. All right.

341
00:17:40.026 --> 00:17:42.662
Okay. Thanks.
Isn't your nephew three?

342
00:17:44.097 --> 00:17:45.665
My God.
That's the same face.

343
00:17:45.698 --> 00:17:47.066
Okay, this will be different.
Exactly the same face.

344
00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.535
This will be different.

345
00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:52.372
Ready? Aah...

346
00:17:53.406 --> 00:17:54.841
That's the exact same thing.

347
00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:55.914
How is that
the same thing?

348
00:17:55.942 --> 00:17:57.110
There was a little bit
of tongue there.

349
00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:58.711
Please stop.
That's not cheering me up.

350
00:17:58.745 --> 00:18:01.080
Do you know what? I'm glad
you said that to Fine.

351
00:18:01.114 --> 00:18:03.850
I am, because you
play it too safe.

352
00:18:03.883 --> 00:18:07.086
I still hear
my mom's voice...

353
00:18:08.155 --> 00:18:10.323
"Well-behaved women
often make history."

354
00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:11.491
Yes, you do know
the phrase is...

355
00:18:11.524 --> 00:18:14.461
"Well-behaved women
seldom make history"?

356
00:18:14.494 --> 00:18:16.028
Yeah. That's never
how she said it.

357
00:18:16.062 --> 00:18:18.097
What were her others?

358
00:18:18.131 --> 00:18:20.167
"Just blend in."
"Let somebody else win."

359
00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:22.101
Classic. I got that a
lot in high school.

360
00:18:22.135 --> 00:18:24.604
And there was, "Give up
on your dream, Susan."

361
00:18:24.637 --> 00:18:26.239
She used to write that
in my lunchbox.

362
00:18:26.806 --> 00:18:27.974
Oh...

363
00:18:28.007 --> 00:18:29.476
I mean, look, okay?

364
00:18:30.477 --> 00:18:32.745
What's really so
different between us

365
00:18:32.779 --> 00:18:34.181
and Karen Walker?

366
00:18:34.214 --> 00:18:36.949
I think literally everything.

367
00:18:36.983 --> 00:18:38.084
No, hang on, no,
because you were

368
00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.686
just as good as her
at the Academy.

369
00:18:39.719 --> 00:18:42.289
She's had more successful
missions than even Fine.

370
00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:43.423
Oh, she's the worst.

371
00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:47.360
Look at her. She thinks she's
so perfect, doesn't she?

372
00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:50.997
"Hi, I'm Karen Walker,
super spy."

373
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.166
Perfect hair.
Perfect face.

374
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.734
She probably cries herself
to sleep every night.

375
00:18:54.767 --> 00:18:56.669
I don't think she probably does.
She probably does.

376
00:18:56.703 --> 00:18:59.539
And not, like,
sort of cute, little tears.

377
00:18:59.572 --> 00:19:02.609
Like, really sort of
silent, kind of big.

378
00:19:03.843 --> 00:19:05.545
I don't think that's what...

379
00:19:05.578 --> 00:19:07.547
Like a sort of upside
down kidney bean.

380
00:19:08.715 --> 00:19:10.082
"This is what I look like
when I'm asleep."

381
00:19:10.116 --> 00:19:11.751
Shut up, be quiet.

382
00:19:11.784 --> 00:19:13.824
She won't know who we are.
She's so full of herself.

383
00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:15.955
Hi. Hey, Nancy.
Hi, Susan.

384
00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:16.988
Hi!

385
00:19:18.358 --> 00:19:21.328
Look at you two cuties
sitting here being all cute.

386
00:19:21.361 --> 00:19:22.629
Aw!

387
00:19:23.162 --> 00:19:25.298
Oh, you.

388
00:19:25.332 --> 00:19:26.866
Can I have
an Old Fashioned, please?

389
00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.701
The service is really slow.

390
00:19:28.735 --> 00:19:31.271
Super slow. Good luck getting
that in the next hour.

391
00:19:31.304 --> 00:19:32.739
Here you go, Miss Walker.
Thank you.

392
00:19:32.772 --> 00:19:34.374
Oh.
Wow.

393
00:19:34.407 --> 00:19:36.476
Alan and I go way back.
I come here all the time.

394
00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.311
So do we.
Right, Alan?

395
00:19:38.345 --> 00:19:40.280
Hey, Alan. Alan!

396
00:19:40.313 --> 00:19:41.648
Big A, Big A!

397
00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:43.617
Whoo-hoo!
Al! We got a whole...

398
00:19:43.651 --> 00:19:45.386
Miss Walker,
are these two bothering you?

399
00:19:45.419 --> 00:19:47.054
No, thank you. They're fine.
Okay.

400
00:19:47.087 --> 00:19:48.155
Alan!

401
00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.623
He's the sweetest.

402
00:19:49.657 --> 00:19:51.124
He totally pretends
not to know. It's a game.

403
00:19:51.158 --> 00:19:52.726
He's funny.
Yeah.

404
00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.528
Well, anyway,
I'm taking some time off,

405
00:19:54.562 --> 00:19:56.129
so I'll see you guys
when I get back.

406
00:19:56.163 --> 00:19:57.498
Oh.
Where are you going?

407
00:19:57.531 --> 00:19:58.666
Capri.

408
00:19:58.699 --> 00:20:00.701
Capri.
Capri.

409
00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:03.174
I believe it's "Cahpri." That's
how the locals say it, anyway.

410
00:20:03.237 --> 00:20:04.838
Oh...

411
00:20:04.872 --> 00:20:06.774
I wish I could just
stick around here...

412
00:20:06.807 --> 00:20:08.576
curl up with a good book.

413
00:20:08.609 --> 00:20:11.279
But I have a yacht full of
friends waiting for me.

414
00:20:11.312 --> 00:20:13.180
Wow.
Yachts are the worst.

415
00:20:13.213 --> 00:20:15.416
They seem
so glamorous, but...

416
00:20:15.449 --> 00:20:16.550
- They're the worst.
- Boo, yachts.

417
00:20:16.584 --> 00:20:18.886
Anyhoo, I'll see you guys
when I get back,

418
00:20:18.919 --> 00:20:20.120
all freckled and tan.

419
00:20:20.153 --> 00:20:21.153
We're gonna see you.

420
00:20:21.589 --> 00:20:22.956
Bye.
Bye!

421
00:20:24.925 --> 00:20:26.226
Oh, sorry.

422
00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:27.295
Susan is ill.

423
00:20:28.195 --> 00:20:29.430
It's her stomach.

424
00:20:31.732 --> 00:20:33.701
Oh, my God.
Thank you for that.

425
00:20:33.734 --> 00:20:35.168
Why would you do that?
I panicked.

426
00:20:35.202 --> 00:20:36.202
What a great moment.

427
00:20:37.671 --> 00:20:38.806
Just look at her.

428
00:20:38.839 --> 00:20:40.341
I know. That dress.

429
00:20:40.374 --> 00:20:42.175
Look at that confidence.

430
00:20:42.209 --> 00:20:44.312
You're not even allowed
to smoke in here.

431
00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:47.281
I'm gonna go home.

432
00:20:47.315 --> 00:20:48.516
No, come on.

433
00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:49.683
Yes.

434
00:20:49.717 --> 00:20:50.718
Susan.

435
00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:52.286
Feel better.

436
00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.021
Thank you. Yeah.

437
00:20:54.788 --> 00:20:56.223
Fine, you good?

438
00:20:56.256 --> 00:20:58.292
Okay, Coop.
Just pulling up.

439
00:20:58.326 --> 00:21:00.294
Susan, you're killing it.

440
00:21:00.328 --> 00:21:02.095
Oh, good.
It's the chicory.

441
00:21:02.129 --> 00:21:03.129
Yeah.

442
00:21:06.033 --> 00:21:07.401
Any sign of her in the house?

443
00:21:07.435 --> 00:21:09.370
Heat sensors
aren't picking anything up.

444
00:21:09.403 --> 00:21:10.571
There's some kind
of interference.

445
00:21:10.604 --> 00:21:12.773
I don't like this, Fine.

446
00:21:12.806 --> 00:21:14.041
I'm up for the challenge.

447
00:21:14.074 --> 00:21:15.576
Let's go in.

448
00:21:20.448 --> 00:21:22.149
Shoot, there's something
wrong with your camera.

449
00:21:22.182 --> 00:21:23.216
Can you switch it out
for a new one?

450
00:21:23.250 --> 00:21:24.452
Too late.

451
00:21:32.393 --> 00:21:34.595
No security.

452
00:21:34.628 --> 00:21:37.531
Her father would never have
left himself this exposed.

453
00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:40.468
Pull back, Fine.
This is too easy.

454
00:21:40.501 --> 00:21:41.735
I like things that are easy.

455
00:21:49.343 --> 00:21:51.379
Oh, my God, Fine!

456
00:21:51.412 --> 00:21:52.946
I don't know how
you do things like that.

457
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.348
Hey.

458
00:21:54.382 --> 00:21:56.116
Who's the finest of them all?

459
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:57.951
I don't know.

460
00:21:57.985 --> 00:21:59.620
I'm guessing you?

461
00:22:00.287 --> 00:22:01.922
Drop your weapon.

462
00:22:01.955 --> 00:22:03.457
Fine, what's happening?

463
00:22:03.491 --> 00:22:04.958
Let me guess.
Whoever is in your ear

464
00:22:04.992 --> 00:22:06.560
wants to know
what's happening?

465
00:22:07.628 --> 00:22:09.697
He's about to die.

466
00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:11.399
That's what.

467
00:22:15.369 --> 00:22:17.505
An awfully big gun
for such a little girl.

468
00:22:17.538 --> 00:22:20.608
Oh, God, don't say
stuff like that.

469
00:22:20.641 --> 00:22:22.142
Okay, there's a knife rack
directly to your right.

470
00:22:22.175 --> 00:22:24.812
The way she's holding the gun,
she's not experienced.

471
00:22:24.845 --> 00:22:27.515
If you duck and lunge, you can
get the knife and disarm her.

472
00:22:27.548 --> 00:22:29.868
Did someone just suggest that
you grab one of those knives?

473
00:22:31.018 --> 00:22:32.786
No, no, no!

474
00:22:32.820 --> 00:22:33.820
Damn it!

475
00:22:34.087 --> 00:22:35.087
Fine!

476
00:22:36.323 --> 00:22:37.958
Can they see me right now?

477
00:22:39.493 --> 00:22:40.933
Let me adjust
the angle a little bit.

478
00:22:46.934 --> 00:22:48.402
Oh, my God, Fine.

479
00:22:50.438 --> 00:22:53.907
His name was Bradley Fine.
He worked for the CIA.

480
00:22:53.941 --> 00:22:55.676
Other top agents include

481
00:22:55.709 --> 00:22:58.378
Matthew Wright,
Timothy Cress...

482
00:22:58.412 --> 00:23:01.281
Rick Ford and Karen Walker.

483
00:23:01.314 --> 00:23:03.617
Come on, Fine. Come on.

484
00:23:03.651 --> 00:23:07.555
I know who all
your active agents are.

485
00:23:07.588 --> 00:23:11.124
So, unless you'd like
the body count to grow...

486
00:23:11.158 --> 00:23:13.694
I suggest you stay
far away from me.

487
00:23:14.695 --> 00:23:16.396
Now grab some tissues,

488
00:23:16.430 --> 00:23:18.666
because shit's about
to get real sad.

489
00:23:18.699 --> 00:23:19.699
No, no...

490
00:23:24.104 --> 00:23:25.606
Oh, my God, Fine.

491
00:23:26.173 --> 00:23:28.776
As Deputy Director...

492
00:23:28.809 --> 00:23:32.212
I have never had
a more difficult duty...

493
00:23:32.245 --> 00:23:36.249
than to bid farewell
to colleagues taken from us.

494
00:23:36.283 --> 00:23:39.419
From Dover,
to the family services...

495
00:23:39.453 --> 00:23:41.622
to memorials like these...

496
00:23:41.655 --> 00:23:42.990
it's tough to say goodbye.

497
00:23:43.023 --> 00:23:45.559
There's nothing you
could have done, Susan.

498
00:23:45.593 --> 00:23:49.697
Bradley Fine was more than
just a coworker and a friend.

499
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:51.565
He was part of our family.

500
00:23:51.599 --> 00:23:53.867
And as family,
even knowing that the universe

501
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:56.804
has a plan
for each human life...

502
00:23:56.837 --> 00:23:58.472
it's hard to accept
the sudden loss

503
00:23:58.506 --> 00:24:01.475
of such a good
and decent person.

504
00:24:04.211 --> 00:24:06.614
Okay, there's a
knife rack directly to your right.

505
00:24:06.647 --> 00:24:09.416
Susan, I got your assessment
report on Rayna Boyanov.

506
00:24:09.449 --> 00:24:11.985
I know you're probably feeling
a lot of emotion right now...

507
00:24:12.019 --> 00:24:15.188
but please refrain from using
the term "thundercunt."

508
00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:18.492
Oh, my God. I didn't
realize I wrote that.

509
00:24:18.526 --> 00:24:19.927
I'm sorry.

510
00:24:29.002 --> 00:24:30.303
Nancy, I'm sending
you a photo.

511
00:24:30.337 --> 00:24:31.705
It's in pretty bad shape.

512
00:24:31.739 --> 00:24:33.073
Can you enhance it?
Mm-hmm.

513
00:24:42.215 --> 00:24:43.584
Paris?

514
00:24:44.818 --> 00:24:48.055
How the fuck did this twat
find out our fucking names?

515
00:24:48.088 --> 00:24:49.523
We don't know.

516
00:24:49.557 --> 00:24:51.825
And dial it way back
with the "T" word, Ford.

517
00:24:51.859 --> 00:24:54.261
You're not immune from the
HR department. Grow up.

518
00:24:54.294 --> 00:24:56.329
And "twat" means something
completely different in England.

519
00:24:56.363 --> 00:24:58.065
Here it means a vagina.

520
00:24:58.098 --> 00:25:00.668
Anyway, obviously
we're talking about a mole.

521
00:25:00.701 --> 00:25:02.202
It could be a mole, they could
have hacked our system.

522
00:25:02.235 --> 00:25:03.270
It's anyone's guess.

523
00:25:03.303 --> 00:25:05.739
The bottom line is Rayna
Boyanov is about to sell...

524
00:25:05.773 --> 00:25:07.675
a small-scale tactical
nuclear weapon

525
00:25:07.708 --> 00:25:09.209
to a terrorist
organization...

526
00:25:09.242 --> 00:25:11.879
and we don't know
where she or the bomb is.

527
00:25:11.912 --> 00:25:14.281
Fortunately, our analyst
Susan Cooper found a lead.

528
00:25:15.716 --> 00:25:17.951
Rayna had the number
of Sergio De Luca...

529
00:25:17.985 --> 00:25:19.687
and we've long
suspected De Luca

530
00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.623
of working as an intermediary
with terrorist groups.

531
00:25:22.656 --> 00:25:24.925
Rayna may be using him
to find buyers for the nuke.

532
00:25:24.958 --> 00:25:27.595
The number was to an office
he keeps in Paris.

533
00:25:27.628 --> 00:25:29.429
I told you to send me in
there instead of Fine,

534
00:25:29.462 --> 00:25:30.831
and you didn't.

535
00:25:30.864 --> 00:25:32.600
And now Fine is dead.
I'm going the fuck in.

536
00:25:32.633 --> 00:25:34.167
You can't.

537
00:25:34.201 --> 00:25:36.103
We need someone to follow De
Luca without being detected...

538
00:25:36.136 --> 00:25:38.238
and that will hopefully
take us to Rayna...

539
00:25:38.271 --> 00:25:39.773
but it can't be any of you.

540
00:25:40.507 --> 00:25:42.810
Here's what we do...

541
00:25:42.843 --> 00:25:46.313
I go into the Face/Off
machine, get a whole new face.

542
00:25:46.346 --> 00:25:48.515
I turn up,
they never know it's me.

543
00:25:48.548 --> 00:25:49.683
Do you have quarters?
Because it costs 50 cents.

544
00:25:49.717 --> 00:25:51.284
What, I gotta pay?

545
00:25:51.318 --> 00:25:53.386
No, because it doesn't exist.

546
00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.955
Yes, it does!

547
00:25:54.988 --> 00:25:58.592
I heard Cress and Wright talking
about it in the shitter.

548
00:25:58.626 --> 00:26:00.427
I'm pretty sure
they were pulling your leg.

549
00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.529
You pair of fucking vaginas.

550
00:26:02.562 --> 00:26:04.798
Seriously,
you've got to cut that out.

551
00:26:04.832 --> 00:26:07.467
Jesus. Look, one of us
has to go in.

552
00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.136
Doesn't matter
if we've been exposed.

553
00:26:09.169 --> 00:26:10.838
We've all gone deep before,

554
00:26:10.871 --> 00:26:12.740
and we've always
gotten our guy.

555
00:26:12.773 --> 00:26:15.175
Guys, this is more than
just a kill mission.

556
00:26:15.208 --> 00:26:17.811
We can get Rayna, De Luca, and
some top terrorist leadership...

557
00:26:17.845 --> 00:26:20.047
and get the weapon back
if we do this right.

558
00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.715
We just need someone
who can shadow them

559
00:26:21.749 --> 00:26:23.717
without attracting attention.

560
00:26:23.751 --> 00:26:24.685
We need someone invisible.

561
00:26:24.718 --> 00:26:25.953
I'll do it.

562
00:26:25.986 --> 00:26:28.188
Okay, thanks, lunch lady.

563
00:26:28.221 --> 00:26:29.489
I'm serious.

564
00:26:29.522 --> 00:26:31.524
I have never
been out in the field.

565
00:26:31.558 --> 00:26:33.961
Exactly. Stupid fucking idea.

566
00:26:33.994 --> 00:26:36.496
My point is that
it's highly doubtful

567
00:26:36.529 --> 00:26:38.198
that I've ever been exposed.

568
00:26:38.231 --> 00:26:40.133
But you worked with Fine.

569
00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:41.234
They may have
a record of you, too.

570
00:26:41.268 --> 00:26:42.836
Possibly.

571
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:45.706
But the odds of them
knowing my face are very low.

572
00:26:45.739 --> 00:26:47.708
Miss Crocker, I would
really like to do this.

573
00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:49.442
For Fine.

574
00:26:49.476 --> 00:26:51.879
What are you gonna do? Bring one
of your cats as a sidekick?

575
00:26:52.713 --> 00:26:54.147
I don't have any cats!

576
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:56.817
You're not seriously
considering this, are you?

577
00:26:57.417 --> 00:26:59.052
Look here, Betty...

578
00:26:59.086 --> 00:27:00.754
Ford, if you call me
Betty Crocker,

579
00:27:00.788 --> 00:27:02.622
I will rip your fucking
heart out of your chest.

580
00:27:02.656 --> 00:27:04.658
Not only did I
become a citizen

581
00:27:04.692 --> 00:27:07.360
and take a vow
to protect this country...

582
00:27:07.394 --> 00:27:11.699
I also took a vow to avenge my
fallen comrades. We all fucking did.

583
00:27:11.732 --> 00:27:14.301
No, we didn't.
Not me.

584
00:27:14.334 --> 00:27:17.437
I'm pretty sure we all took a fucking vow.
I remember it.

585
00:27:17.470 --> 00:27:20.573
I remember raising my fucking
hand and saying some shit.

586
00:27:20.607 --> 00:27:22.876
If you think
I'm gonna sit by

587
00:27:22.910 --> 00:27:24.550
and let you send in
a fucking secretary...

588
00:27:24.577 --> 00:27:26.579
to do my work...

589
00:27:26.613 --> 00:27:28.181
you might as well accept
my resignation now.

590
00:27:28.215 --> 00:27:29.750
If I can jump in,

591
00:27:29.783 --> 00:27:32.652
I am technically, uh,
classified as an agent.

592
00:27:33.353 --> 00:27:34.888
Look...

593
00:27:34.922 --> 00:27:36.824
Full agent. So...

594
00:27:36.857 --> 00:27:39.326
agent, agent, agent,
I'm an agent.

595
00:27:39.993 --> 00:27:41.895
Are you considering this?

596
00:27:41.929 --> 00:27:44.497
For your safety, and the safety
of those around this table...

597
00:27:44.531 --> 00:27:46.233
I am considering it.

598
00:27:46.266 --> 00:27:48.335
Then consider this,
I quit.

599
00:27:51.739 --> 00:27:53.140
And I know there's a fucking
Face/Off machine.

600
00:27:53.173 --> 00:27:55.208
You're just keeping it
secret from me.

601
00:27:56.209 --> 00:27:57.845
Okay.

602
00:27:57.878 --> 00:27:59.518
That hasn't happened before.

603
00:28:01.014 --> 00:28:02.816
It is quite
a lovely office.

604
00:28:03.616 --> 00:28:04.852
What's your deal, Cooper?

605
00:28:05.318 --> 00:28:06.453
What do you mean?

606
00:28:06.486 --> 00:28:08.288
You got a fiery side?

607
00:28:08.321 --> 00:28:11.558
I really did, in that report,
mean to write "cunning."

608
00:28:11.591 --> 00:28:12.993
I've been going over
your files.

609
00:28:13.026 --> 00:28:15.195
You were top of your class
at the Academy,

610
00:28:15.228 --> 00:28:16.629
in all computer
and support skills.

611
00:28:16.663 --> 00:28:17.798
No surprise there.

612
00:28:17.831 --> 00:28:19.699
But you have a certain...

613
00:28:19.733 --> 00:28:21.902
tame demeanor
around the office,

614
00:28:21.935 --> 00:28:23.536
that says you've never
even held a gun.

615
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.439
So imagine my surprise...

616
00:28:26.473 --> 00:28:28.513
when I saw footage from
this drill back at The Farm.

617
00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:34.882
Is that...
I can't even...

618
00:28:34.915 --> 00:28:36.116
Is that me? I can't really...

619
00:28:36.149 --> 00:28:37.389
Stupid gun!

620
00:28:38.786 --> 00:28:40.253
Somebody definitely
sped this up.

621
00:28:41.321 --> 00:28:42.890
Ooh! Camera angle
and stuff make...

622
00:28:45.025 --> 00:28:46.459
Cooper, Cooper, stop!
Jesus Christ, what are you...

623
00:28:46.493 --> 00:28:47.828
Ouch.

624
00:28:47.861 --> 00:28:49.262
Out of context, that's...

625
00:28:50.297 --> 00:28:52.432
I must have watched
this 15 times now...

626
00:28:52.465 --> 00:28:54.101
because what the fuck?

627
00:28:54.134 --> 00:28:55.936
I almost put it up
on YouTube.

628
00:28:55.969 --> 00:29:00.107
I was, to say the least,
uncomfortable with the event.

629
00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.109
But I would also like to say,
it was over 10 years ago.

630
00:29:02.142 --> 00:29:03.410
The instructor
was not harmed.

631
00:29:03.443 --> 00:29:05.645
Fine was your mentor, right?

632
00:29:05.678 --> 00:29:07.114
Yes.

633
00:29:07.147 --> 00:29:10.050
Why did you not
become a field agent?

634
00:29:10.083 --> 00:29:11.551
Well, we're such a great
fit and a great team.

635
00:29:11.584 --> 00:29:13.386
Fine made
some great points.

636
00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.323
Maybe I match better with,
just staying...

637
00:29:16.356 --> 00:29:17.958
In his ear.
Well...

638
00:29:17.991 --> 00:29:19.459
Yeah, he sniped you.

639
00:29:19.492 --> 00:29:21.461
All the top agents used to
do that before I got here.

640
00:29:21.494 --> 00:29:23.263
I really thought he made
some great points.

641
00:29:24.231 --> 00:29:26.066
Women.

642
00:29:26.099 --> 00:29:27.567
All right, have you had any
field training since then?

643
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:28.601
10 years is a long time.

644
00:29:28.635 --> 00:29:30.270
No, ma'am.

645
00:29:30.303 --> 00:29:32.906
Normally, I would send you back to
The Farm, but there's no time...

646
00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.242
and I can't take a chance of
anyone leaking your name.

647
00:29:35.275 --> 00:29:37.110
Am I going?

648
00:29:37.610 --> 00:29:38.711
You're going.

649
00:29:38.745 --> 00:29:41.214
Okay. Jeez. Sorry.

650
00:29:41.248 --> 00:29:45.018
But it's a track and report
mission only.

651
00:29:45.452 --> 00:29:46.719
Got it.

652
00:29:46.753 --> 00:29:47.921
We'll be giving you
a new identity.

653
00:29:47.955 --> 00:29:49.689
You'll no longer be
Susan Cooper.

654
00:29:49.722 --> 00:29:51.892
I had a few ideas for that.
Your new name...

655
00:29:51.925 --> 00:29:53.526
I was just spitballing
and I thought...

656
00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:55.628
Seraphina,
Maddox, Gisele...

657
00:29:55.662 --> 00:29:57.297
Carol Jenkins.

658
00:29:57.330 --> 00:29:58.598
Carol Jenkins.

659
00:29:58.631 --> 00:30:00.300
If I may, ma'am,

660
00:30:00.333 --> 00:30:03.436
there was a 13-year-old girl
named Carol...

661
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.572
that used to kind of take me
around the neighborhood...

662
00:30:05.605 --> 00:30:07.207
and use my braid
as a dog leash...

663
00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.342
and make me
beg for biscuits...

664
00:30:09.376 --> 00:30:10.978
Carol Jenkins.

665
00:30:11.011 --> 00:30:13.380
Yes. Carol Jenkins, huh?

666
00:30:13.413 --> 00:30:15.883
Carol Jenkins
is a single mother of four...

667
00:30:15.916 --> 00:30:18.051
temporarily relocated
from Delaware

668
00:30:18.085 --> 00:30:19.887
to increase sales
for a software company.

669
00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.821
Okay, that is...

670
00:30:21.855 --> 00:30:23.356
a different occup...

671
00:30:25.058 --> 00:30:27.327
Is there a problem?
No.

672
00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.160
I was just wondering if this was my
family, or if I had taken hostages.

673
00:30:31.031 --> 00:30:32.699
I'm just not sure...

674
00:30:32.732 --> 00:30:35.002
how De Luca is gonna take me
seriously if I look like this.

675
00:30:35.035 --> 00:30:37.037
De Luca is not going to
take you anything.

676
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:38.205
In case
you did not hear me...

677
00:30:38.238 --> 00:30:39.606
you are not to make
direct contact

678
00:30:39.639 --> 00:30:41.308
with any of the targets.

679
00:30:41.341 --> 00:30:43.776
Track and report.

680
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.345
We're setting you up
in a surveillance office

681
00:30:45.378 --> 00:30:46.980
across the street
from De Luca's.

682
00:30:47.014 --> 00:30:48.515
You'll be tapped into
the same telecom trunk...

683
00:30:48.548 --> 00:30:51.018
and have access to voice and
data coming into his office...

684
00:30:51.051 --> 00:30:52.251
and that is as sexy
as it gets.

685
00:30:52.585 --> 00:30:54.021
One mistake,

686
00:30:54.054 --> 00:30:56.389
and we've got a nuclear bomb
in the hands of terrorists.

687
00:30:56.423 --> 00:30:57.357
Do you understand?

688
00:30:57.390 --> 00:30:58.858
Yes.

689
00:30:58.892 --> 00:31:00.892
Go see Patrick. He's got
special equipment for you.

690
00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:07.567
Oh, my God.

691
00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:08.969
What are you doing?

692
00:31:11.404 --> 00:31:12.940
Did you come up
with your spy name yet?

693
00:31:12.973 --> 00:31:15.408
Mine would be
"Amber Valentine."

694
00:31:15.442 --> 00:31:17.410
That sounds like
you're an adult film star.

695
00:31:17.444 --> 00:31:19.179
No, I did the spy
name formula.

696
00:31:19.212 --> 00:31:20.480
"Amber" was the name
of my first pet,

697
00:31:20.513 --> 00:31:21.949
and I grew up
on Valentine Street.

698
00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:23.816
That's how you come up
with your porn name.

699
00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:25.752
I thought it was your spy name!
No!

700
00:31:25.785 --> 00:31:27.120
What would yours be?

701
00:31:27.154 --> 00:31:29.656
"Meatball Martin
Luther King Jr. Boulevard."

702
00:31:30.557 --> 00:31:31.624
Yeah.
Wow.

703
00:31:33.493 --> 00:31:35.228
Oh, my God.

704
00:31:36.629 --> 00:31:37.629
This is so exciting!

705
00:31:38.798 --> 00:31:39.899
You're a spy!

706
00:31:39.933 --> 00:31:41.201
I know! I know!

707
00:31:41.234 --> 00:31:42.335
Oh, my God!

708
00:31:42.369 --> 00:31:43.636
You're gonna get
one of those!

709
00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:44.972
No, I'm not!

710
00:31:45.672 --> 00:31:47.274
Look at that!

711
00:31:47.307 --> 00:31:49.142
That looks high-tech.

712
00:31:49.176 --> 00:31:50.643
It's like the future.

713
00:31:52.045 --> 00:31:53.213
Patrick.
Susan.

714
00:31:53.246 --> 00:31:55.115
Hey, Patrick.
Yes.

715
00:31:55.148 --> 00:31:57.184
I was given specific
instructions by Elaine

716
00:31:57.217 --> 00:31:58.417
to tailor these
gadgets to you.

717
00:31:59.619 --> 00:32:00.753
- Wow.
- Wow, look at that watch.

718
00:32:00.787 --> 00:32:01.787
These are not yours.

719
00:32:01.854 --> 00:32:02.990
Oh.

720
00:32:06.526 --> 00:32:08.128
Is that a rape whistle?

721
00:32:08.161 --> 00:32:10.430
Elaine wanted you
to only be carrying items

722
00:32:10.463 --> 00:32:13.466
a single woman travelling
through Europe would have.

723
00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.035
But she could get that
at any pharmacy.

724
00:32:15.068 --> 00:32:16.903
Not this whistle.

725
00:32:16.936 --> 00:32:18.305
When you blow
through this whistle,

726
00:32:18.338 --> 00:32:20.173
a small, poisonous
dart flies out...

727
00:32:20.207 --> 00:32:22.142
neutralizing your target.

728
00:32:22.175 --> 00:32:25.045
Also, it needs your
fingerprints on it to work.

729
00:32:25.078 --> 00:32:26.879
That is really neat!
Stop it, that's amazing.

730
00:32:26.913 --> 00:32:29.182
That is really super cool!
I love that!

731
00:32:29.216 --> 00:32:31.096
This anti-fungal spray
can freeze and disable...

732
00:32:31.784 --> 00:32:33.320
any security system.

733
00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:35.522
Wow.

734
00:32:35.555 --> 00:32:37.657
That is quite an image to be
carrying all over Europe.

735
00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:39.292
It's also a pepper spray.

736
00:32:39.326 --> 00:32:41.561
Why not just make it
look like pepper spray?

737
00:32:41.594 --> 00:32:43.430
That's a pretty good idea.

738
00:32:43.463 --> 00:32:44.597
Well, next time.

739
00:32:44.631 --> 00:32:46.033
I can wait,

740
00:32:46.066 --> 00:32:48.135
if you want to print up
a new label.

741
00:32:48.168 --> 00:32:50.803
No, I'd have to turn
the printer on again.

742
00:32:50.837 --> 00:32:51.837
I don't really want to.

743
00:32:52.573 --> 00:32:54.475
Each of these
are filled with chloroform.

744
00:32:54.508 --> 00:32:58.079
Wow, that is an unsettling
amount of hemorrhoid wipes.

745
00:32:58.112 --> 00:32:59.847
Makes me kind of wonder...

746
00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:02.250
what, exactly,
is going on back there.

747
00:33:02.283 --> 00:33:03.717
I wouldn't know.
I don't have that problem.

748
00:33:03.751 --> 00:33:05.219
I don't have that problem.

749
00:33:05.253 --> 00:33:07.055
If you ever feel like
you have been poisoned...

750
00:33:07.088 --> 00:33:08.589
chew one of these.

751
00:33:13.394 --> 00:33:15.629
Have I done something
to you to upset you?

752
00:33:17.231 --> 00:33:19.500
Because this is
a peculiar theme.

753
00:33:19.533 --> 00:33:22.670
Finally, every agent gets
a night vision scope...

754
00:33:22.703 --> 00:33:24.305
hidden in their watch.

755
00:33:24.338 --> 00:33:26.774
I have heard about this.
I've been looking...

756
00:33:26.807 --> 00:33:28.342
Oh.
Who's that?

757
00:33:28.376 --> 00:33:30.278
That is Bette Midler
and Barbara Hershey.

758
00:33:30.711 --> 00:33:32.146
From Beaches.

759
00:33:33.347 --> 00:33:36.317
How much am I supposed
to like Beaches?

760
00:33:36.350 --> 00:33:38.619
I would imagine a lot,
if you have the watch.

761
00:33:38.652 --> 00:33:40.421
- Hey, Pat, I'm flying!
- Anthony!

762
00:33:40.454 --> 00:33:42.090
Don't wear out
the battery on that.

763
00:33:42.123 --> 00:33:43.791
Am I getting that?

764
00:33:43.824 --> 00:33:45.859
No, you're not
gonna get that.

765
00:33:45.893 --> 00:33:48.093
I've already packed your bags.
Hurry up and get dressed.

766
00:33:48.829 --> 00:33:51.499
Carol Jenkins has to get
to the airport immediately.

767
00:33:51.532 --> 00:33:52.933
And may I say...

768
00:33:52.966 --> 00:33:53.934
I think it's very brave
of you to sacrifice

769
00:33:53.967 --> 00:33:55.503
your life for your country.

770
00:33:55.536 --> 00:33:57.705
I'm not sacrifi...
I'm coming back.

771
00:33:58.372 --> 00:34:00.274
Let's see.

772
00:34:00.308 --> 00:34:03.077
Hey, Pat! I'm gonna totally
crop dust these guys.

773
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:04.312
Way to go, Anthony.

774
00:34:04.345 --> 00:34:06.280
Oh, just pardon me.

775
00:34:06.314 --> 00:34:07.594
Oh, God.
I think I shit my pants.

776
00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:21.028
You look amazing, Susan.

777
00:34:21.061 --> 00:34:23.364
I look like someone's
homophobic aunt.

778
00:34:28.936 --> 00:34:30.304
Wow.

779
00:34:30.338 --> 00:34:32.140
Hotel Modiere, please.

780
00:34:34.208 --> 00:34:35.743
This is so exciting.

781
00:34:35.776 --> 00:34:36.776
Ooh.

782
00:34:37.778 --> 00:34:38.779
The Louvre.

783
00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:41.182
Wow.

784
00:34:41.215 --> 00:34:42.850
That's a beautiful hotel.

785
00:34:42.883 --> 00:34:44.218
Not that one?

786
00:34:44.252 --> 00:34:45.819
I hope it's that.
Is it that one?

787
00:34:45.853 --> 00:34:48.889
Nope. Oh...
Maybe next time.

788
00:34:48.922 --> 00:34:52.393
I think we're getting into
a little dicier of an area.

789
00:34:54.728 --> 00:34:55.928
Ooh. That's a little unsavory.

790
00:34:56.697 --> 00:34:59.633
I think we can probably
go back towards...

791
00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:00.667
my hotel.

792
00:35:01.202 --> 00:35:02.703
No, no, no.

793
00:35:02.736 --> 00:35:05.173
No, this...

794
00:35:05.206 --> 00:35:09.377
I don't believe this could be
the Hotel Modiere.

795
00:35:11.745 --> 00:35:13.314
This is. Yes, it is.

796
00:35:38.706 --> 00:35:39.840
Oh, man.

797
00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:54.722
Keep it together,
Susan, okay?

798
00:35:55.656 --> 00:35:56.890
Nancy?

799
00:35:56.924 --> 00:35:58.058
Please tell me
you can hear me.

800
00:35:58.091 --> 00:35:59.126
I'm here. I've got you.

801
00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:00.661
Okay.

802
00:36:00.694 --> 00:36:01.962
You'll be pleased to hear the
bats have officially gone.

803
00:36:01.995 --> 00:36:04.131
We are now vermin free.

804
00:36:04.164 --> 00:36:05.766
Did you get your gun, Carol?

805
00:36:05.799 --> 00:36:07.868
Yes, and don't call me that.

806
00:36:07.901 --> 00:36:11.639
Oh, my God. Cripes. I think
I'm having a heart attack.

807
00:36:11.672 --> 00:36:14.575
I can't do this, Nancy. Fine
was the real spy, not me!

808
00:36:14.608 --> 00:36:15.943
Don't worry.

809
00:36:15.976 --> 00:36:17.645
I'm here for you, okay?
Everything is gonna be fine.

810
00:36:17.678 --> 00:36:19.480
I'm gonna talk you
through this, all right?

811
00:36:19.513 --> 00:36:21.233
Put your camera in.
I want to see your room.

812
00:36:22.115 --> 00:36:24.852
No, you don't.
It's that bad.

813
00:36:24.885 --> 00:36:26.787
Martha Stewart had
a breakdown, kind of feel.

814
00:36:27.721 --> 00:36:29.690
Oh. Wow.

815
00:36:29.723 --> 00:36:32.059
Looks like they put you up
in The Shitz-Carlton.

816
00:36:32.092 --> 00:36:33.694
Try and get some sleep...

817
00:36:33.727 --> 00:36:35.729
and we'll get started
first thing in the morning.

818
00:36:35.763 --> 00:36:38.432
I don't know what I'm gonna do
when I see that Rayna woman.

819
00:36:38.466 --> 00:36:39.933
I want her dead
for what she did to Fine.

820
00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:42.303
Okay. Deep breaths.

821
00:36:42.336 --> 00:36:44.972
Listen to me. You're not gonna
get anywhere near her...

822
00:36:45.005 --> 00:36:46.340
so there's nothing
to worry about.

823
00:36:47.308 --> 00:36:49.076
Oh, God. Really?

824
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:50.344
Guys...

825
00:36:51.011 --> 00:36:52.846
there's a mouse on my tits.

826
00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:54.515
I think you're safer there.

827
00:36:54.548 --> 00:36:56.617
All right. Good night.
Night.

828
00:36:59.787 --> 00:37:00.787
Ah!

829
00:37:10.431 --> 00:37:13.000
You got this, Susan. Okay.

830
00:37:13.033 --> 00:37:14.702
You're a warrior.

831
00:37:15.503 --> 00:37:18.739
You're a weapon. Okay?

832
00:37:18.772 --> 00:37:20.508
- This is no sweat.
- Looks like you're sweating to me.

833
00:37:20.541 --> 00:37:21.642
Jesus!

834
00:37:24.144 --> 00:37:25.879
What are you doing
in my room?

835
00:37:25.913 --> 00:37:27.948
What, how did I get into
this shit-box hotel room?

836
00:37:27.981 --> 00:37:29.450
Because I'm a real spy.

837
00:37:29.483 --> 00:37:30.818
I thought you quit.

838
00:37:30.851 --> 00:37:33.053
We have to stop the sale
of a nuclear bomb...

839
00:37:33.086 --> 00:37:36.056
and they send in someone who looks
like Santa Claus' fucking wife.

840
00:37:36.089 --> 00:37:38.359
Did you forget?
I am undercover,

841
00:37:38.392 --> 00:37:40.093
because you're not
supposed to be here.

842
00:37:40.127 --> 00:37:42.763
I make a habit of doing things
that people say I can't do.

843
00:37:42.796 --> 00:37:44.197
Walk through fire...

844
00:37:44.231 --> 00:37:45.733
water-ski blindfolded...

845
00:37:45.766 --> 00:37:47.601
take up piano
at a late age...

846
00:37:47.635 --> 00:37:49.603
and I'm gonna
take down De Luca

847
00:37:49.637 --> 00:37:51.171
and Rayna and Dudaev...

848
00:37:51.204 --> 00:37:52.473
and I'm gonna
get that bomb back.

849
00:37:52.506 --> 00:37:54.308
Why do you even
care what I do?

850
00:37:54.342 --> 00:37:56.377
You really think
you're ready for the field?

851
00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.546
I once used
defibrillators on myself.

852
00:37:58.579 --> 00:38:01.482
I've pulled shards of glass
out of my fucking eye.

853
00:38:01.515 --> 00:38:04.284
I've jumped
from a high-rise building...

854
00:38:04.318 --> 00:38:06.987
using only a raincoat
as a parachute...

855
00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:08.389
and broke both legs
upon landing.

856
00:38:08.422 --> 00:38:10.391
And I still had to pretend

857
00:38:10.424 --> 00:38:12.760
I was in a fucking
Cirque du Soleil show!

858
00:38:12.793 --> 00:38:14.562
I've swallowed
enough microchips

859
00:38:14.595 --> 00:38:15.963
and shit them
back out again...

860
00:38:15.996 --> 00:38:17.431
to make a computer.

861
00:38:17.465 --> 00:38:20.100
This arm has been ripped off
completely...

862
00:38:20.133 --> 00:38:22.536
and reattached
with this fucking arm.

863
00:38:22.570 --> 00:38:24.972
I don't know
that that's possible.

864
00:38:25.005 --> 00:38:26.273
I mean, medically.

865
00:38:26.306 --> 00:38:29.109
During the threat
of an assassination attempt...

866
00:38:29.142 --> 00:38:31.779
I appeared, convincingly,
in front of Congress...

867
00:38:31.812 --> 00:38:32.846
as Barack Obama.

868
00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.315
In blackface?

869
00:38:35.349 --> 00:38:37.284
That's not appropriate.

870
00:38:37.317 --> 00:38:41.021
I watched the couple that
raised me explode in a van.

871
00:38:41.054 --> 00:38:43.857
I watched the woman I love
get tossed from a plane...

872
00:38:43.891 --> 00:38:45.926
and hit by another plane,
midair.

873
00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.295
I drove a car
off a freeway...

874
00:38:48.328 --> 00:38:50.498
on top of a train...

875
00:38:50.531 --> 00:38:51.699
while I was on fire.

876
00:38:51.732 --> 00:38:53.367
Not the car.

877
00:38:53.401 --> 00:38:55.068
I was on fire.

878
00:38:55.102 --> 00:38:56.470
Jesus, you're intense.

879
00:38:59.106 --> 00:39:00.508
I took this
from your minibar.

880
00:39:00.541 --> 00:39:01.942
Well, that's not right.

881
00:39:08.148 --> 00:39:10.418
You're gonna ruin
this mission.

882
00:39:10.451 --> 00:39:12.720
No, you're gonna ruin
this mission!

883
00:39:13.153 --> 00:39:14.655
No.

884
00:39:14.688 --> 00:39:15.856
You are.

885
00:39:17.057 --> 00:39:18.559
No, you're going to!

886
00:39:19.927 --> 00:39:22.162
You, times infinity.

887
00:39:22.195 --> 00:39:23.631
Aw...

888
00:39:23.664 --> 00:39:25.699
Could this hotel
be more murder-y?

889
00:39:34.207 --> 00:39:37.010
Okay, so my office
is in here...

890
00:39:37.044 --> 00:39:38.512
which means that De Luca

891
00:39:38.546 --> 00:39:40.781
is right across
the street at 39...

892
00:39:44.752 --> 00:39:47.688
Oh, God. Tell me that's not
De Luca's building?

893
00:39:47.721 --> 00:39:49.723
De Luca must have known
we were coming.

894
00:39:49.757 --> 00:39:51.459
What am I supposed to do now?

895
00:39:51.492 --> 00:39:53.060
Okay, don't panic.

896
00:39:53.093 --> 00:39:55.496
Lemonade out of lemons.
Stay focused. We can do this.

897
00:40:24.057 --> 00:40:25.258
Okay, I've got it.

898
00:40:25.292 --> 00:40:27.612
I'll run it through the system.
It will take a few minutes.

899
00:40:33.867 --> 00:40:34.947
Nothing's coming up.

900
00:40:35.636 --> 00:40:36.676
Might just be a looky-loo.

901
00:40:37.304 --> 00:40:38.672
Keep looking.

902
00:40:38.706 --> 00:40:40.107
I've got a feeling
about this guy.

903
00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.610
I've got a feeling you're
about to fuck things up.

904
00:40:45.546 --> 00:40:48.148
Oh, bugger me with a fish pole.
It's Ford.

905
00:40:48.181 --> 00:40:50.551
Sharon, Ford's in the field.
Did you know this?

906
00:40:50.584 --> 00:40:52.586
Until he checks in,
there's nothing I can do.

907
00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:54.855
You go make some friends,
and stop stalking me!

908
00:40:54.888 --> 00:40:56.957
Was it your mission
to tip off the target

909
00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:59.459
so he burns everything
in advance?

910
00:40:59.493 --> 00:41:02.262
If so, well done.
Phenomenal job.

911
00:41:02.295 --> 00:41:04.798
I'm sure they got suspicious because they've
been seeing you all over the place!

912
00:41:04.832 --> 00:41:06.033
You're gonna
get yourself killed.

913
00:41:06.066 --> 00:41:07.134
Nothing kills me.

914
00:41:07.167 --> 00:41:10.103
I'm immune to 179
different types of poison.

915
00:41:10.137 --> 00:41:13.140
I know, because I ingested
them all at once...

916
00:41:13.173 --> 00:41:14.675
when I was
deep undercover...

917
00:41:14.708 --> 00:41:17.745
in an underground,
poison-ingesting crime ring.

918
00:41:17.778 --> 00:41:19.479
Wow.
It was like dog fighting.

919
00:41:19.513 --> 00:41:20.881
But instead of dogs fighting,

920
00:41:20.914 --> 00:41:22.816
it was humans
ingesting poison...

921
00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:24.852
and rich people would bet...

922
00:41:24.885 --> 00:41:26.654
whether we would
live or die.

923
00:41:26.687 --> 00:41:29.156
Yeah, I'm having
a hard time with this one.

924
00:41:29.189 --> 00:41:31.424
I died for five minutes,
and then I came back to life.

925
00:41:31.458 --> 00:41:32.893
What's he wear...?

926
00:41:32.926 --> 00:41:34.628
He looks like
he's in the cast of Newsies.

927
00:41:34.662 --> 00:41:36.664
Does Crocker
even know you're here?

928
00:41:36.697 --> 00:41:37.698
I don't need
anyone's permission

929
00:41:37.731 --> 00:41:39.299
to save the country...

930
00:41:39.332 --> 00:41:41.434
and avenge my dear friend
Bradley Fine's death.

931
00:41:41.468 --> 00:41:42.870
You didn't even like him.

932
00:41:42.903 --> 00:41:44.672
You used to call him
"Beverly Whine"!

933
00:41:44.705 --> 00:41:47.240
You had him as Secret Santa
and you gave him tampons!

934
00:41:47.274 --> 00:41:48.508
It's called
the rivalry of men.

935
00:41:48.542 --> 00:41:49.977
You wouldn't understand.

936
00:41:50.010 --> 00:41:52.646
Unless you've got a dong up
underneath that skirt.

937
00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:54.347
That is super rude,
and don't say "dong"...

938
00:41:54.381 --> 00:41:55.783
and don't do that!

939
00:41:55.816 --> 00:41:58.886
Nobody sees me
when I don't want them to.

940
00:41:58.919 --> 00:42:01.054
I move like a fucking shadow.

941
00:42:03.857 --> 00:42:05.492
He's gone all sorts of rogue.

942
00:42:05.525 --> 00:42:07.527
Sharon says he really did quit.
Elaine couldn't stop him.

943
00:42:07.561 --> 00:42:09.062
He's out for blood.

944
00:42:09.096 --> 00:42:11.096
Yeah, real tough guy in his
Louis Vuitton backpack.

945
00:42:14.501 --> 00:42:15.803
Nancy, do you see that?

946
00:42:15.836 --> 00:42:17.204
It's the man from the fire.

947
00:42:18.471 --> 00:42:19.573
I'm following him.

948
00:42:19.607 --> 00:42:21.642
Oh. Exciting!

949
00:42:21.675 --> 00:42:23.243
And I'm following you,
following him,

950
00:42:23.276 --> 00:42:24.544
so I'm having
quite a day, here.

951
00:42:30.984 --> 00:42:33.420
Do you think Ford's
leading him into a trap?

952
00:42:33.453 --> 00:42:35.555
Idiot doesn't even know
he's being followed.

953
00:42:39.292 --> 00:42:40.994
He's meeting
with some woman.

954
00:42:41.028 --> 00:42:43.230
I don't recognize her. You
have any idea who she is?

955
00:42:43.263 --> 00:42:44.464
No, it's hard to make out.

956
00:42:44.497 --> 00:42:45.497
Can you get any closer?

957
00:42:49.770 --> 00:42:51.071
Nancy, our guy
just switched out

958
00:42:51.104 --> 00:42:52.264
Ford's backpack.
It's a setup.

959
00:42:54.374 --> 00:42:55.575
Uh...

960
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:56.810
I gotta go warn him!

961
00:42:56.844 --> 00:42:58.511
Ford! Ford!

962
00:42:58.545 --> 00:43:00.513
Look out!
I gotta get through!

963
00:43:00.547 --> 00:43:02.082
I left my baby in the shop!

964
00:43:02.115 --> 00:43:04.484
Get out of the way!
Let me through, I'm sick!

965
00:43:04.517 --> 00:43:06.854
Susan, tell them
you've shat your pants.

966
00:43:06.887 --> 00:43:07.921
That would get me
out of your way, for sure.

967
00:43:08.455 --> 00:43:10.624
I've shat my pants!

968
00:43:10.658 --> 00:43:12.092
Excuse me. Ford!

969
00:43:14.527 --> 00:43:15.527
He's got a friend.

970
00:43:18.298 --> 00:43:19.833
Hello, everybody!

971
00:43:32.646 --> 00:43:33.714
Ford!

972
00:43:34.347 --> 00:43:35.347
Ford!

973
00:43:35.983 --> 00:43:36.983
Ford!

974
00:43:43.456 --> 00:43:44.624
I need the mic!

975
00:43:44.658 --> 00:43:45.793
No! I need...

976
00:43:45.826 --> 00:43:46.826
No!

977
00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:48.862
No!

978
00:43:49.529 --> 00:43:51.498
No, no, no!

979
00:43:51.531 --> 00:43:52.766
Susan, you're meant
to be blending in.

980
00:43:52.800 --> 00:43:54.868
What are you doing?

981
00:43:54.902 --> 00:43:56.003
God! Move!

982
00:43:57.705 --> 00:43:59.372
Rick Ford!

983
00:44:00.808 --> 00:44:01.808
Give me the mic!

984
00:44:04.511 --> 00:44:06.046
How are you doing
this in heels?

985
00:44:06.079 --> 00:44:07.079
Oh, God.

986
00:44:09.149 --> 00:44:10.149
Rick Ford!

987
00:44:11.484 --> 00:44:13.353
They switched the bag!

988
00:44:15.655 --> 00:44:17.057
Oh, fuck.

989
00:44:17.090 --> 00:44:18.458
Get out of the fucking way!

990
00:44:18.491 --> 00:44:19.693
Move!

991
00:44:19.727 --> 00:44:20.728
Get out of his way!

992
00:44:21.328 --> 00:44:22.328
Move!

993
00:44:23.630 --> 00:44:24.630
♪ I want to see

994
00:44:39.446 --> 00:44:40.446
Oh, no.

995
00:44:42.415 --> 00:44:44.484
Nancy, I'm in pursuit
of one of the terrorists!

996
00:44:44.517 --> 00:44:46.253
He took my picture!
He's gonna blow my cover!

997
00:44:46.286 --> 00:44:47.755
You're in pursuit?

998
00:44:47.788 --> 00:44:50.057
What in God's name are you
gonna do if you catch him?

999
00:44:50.090 --> 00:44:52.292
Knock him out with a hemorrhoid wipe.
I don't know!

1000
00:44:52.325 --> 00:44:54.427
I'm just gonna track him
and report his location.

1001
00:44:54.461 --> 00:44:56.363
This all seems
very Rick Ford-y to me.

1002
00:44:56.396 --> 00:44:58.098
I do not condone these sexy

1003
00:44:58.131 --> 00:44:59.699
but reckless actions
of yours, Susan!

1004
00:45:10.243 --> 00:45:12.112
Oh, God.
He went into a building.

1005
00:45:12.145 --> 00:45:13.313
Okay.

1006
00:45:13.346 --> 00:45:16.049
Well done. That's it.
Time to call it a day.

1007
00:45:16.083 --> 00:45:18.385
Location is officially noted.

1008
00:45:18.418 --> 00:45:19.552
I'm following him in.

1009
00:45:19.586 --> 00:45:20.888
What?

1010
00:45:20.921 --> 00:45:22.422
I'm doing this for Fine.

1011
00:45:31.965 --> 00:45:33.366
He's at
the top of the stairs.

1012
00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.102
Oh, gosh, please be careful.

1013
00:45:35.135 --> 00:45:37.537
You are incredibly
out of your league.

1014
00:45:37.570 --> 00:45:39.672
This is just like when I
watched myself in a sex tape.

1015
00:45:39.706 --> 00:45:41.875
There was just a lot of floundering
and laughable moments.

1016
00:45:41.909 --> 00:45:44.444
Nancy, I need you to
not talk until I ask you to.

1017
00:45:44.477 --> 00:45:46.237
I'm sorry, it's just that
I'm really nervous.

1018
00:45:50.383 --> 00:45:51.952
Be careful, Susan.

1019
00:45:58.358 --> 00:45:59.358
Okay.

1020
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:30.992
Oh, hey.

1021
00:46:31.025 --> 00:46:33.694
Imagine running
into you up here.

1022
00:46:33.727 --> 00:46:35.897
I was just looking for my bird.
Just looking...

1023
00:46:35.930 --> 00:46:37.698
Hey, Mr. Beanbag!

1024
00:46:37.731 --> 00:46:38.867
You like birds?

1025
00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.801
All right. All right.

1026
00:46:40.835 --> 00:46:42.436
I'm gonna give you
a warning.

1027
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:45.073
I don't wanna see any more of
that funny bomb stuff, you know?

1028
00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:47.175
All right. That's enough.

1029
00:46:47.208 --> 00:46:49.710
Drop the knife,
or I'll shoot.

1030
00:46:49.743 --> 00:46:51.913
I don't think you will.

1031
00:46:51.946 --> 00:46:54.546
You see, it works better when you
have the bullets inside the gun.

1032
00:46:57.318 --> 00:46:58.920
Oops.

1033
00:46:58.953 --> 00:47:01.655
I guess that CIA training
isn't what it used to be.

1034
00:47:01.689 --> 00:47:02.849
I guess you're
right, asshole.

1035
00:47:11.332 --> 00:47:12.332
No, no, no!

1036
00:47:17.805 --> 00:47:18.907
Oh, God!

1037
00:47:20.909 --> 00:47:22.576
Oh, Susan, what did you do?

1038
00:47:27.681 --> 00:47:29.183
Oh, God, not on him.

1039
00:47:29.217 --> 00:47:30.318
Not on him!

1040
00:47:38.226 --> 00:47:39.928
Oh, God,
why did I have that stew?

1041
00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.940
Well, Rayna's people
obviously knew Ford was in Paris.

1042
00:47:49.403 --> 00:47:50.638
And getting footage...

1043
00:47:50.671 --> 00:47:52.706
of a CIA operative setting
off a bomb in public...

1044
00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.176
would be a PR coup
for any terrorist group.

1045
00:47:55.209 --> 00:47:57.145
Do we have anything on
that woman he met?

1046
00:47:57.178 --> 00:47:59.080
Facial recognition
isn't showing anything.

1047
00:47:59.113 --> 00:48:01.449
They were all over Ford.
Are you able to track him?

1048
00:48:01.482 --> 00:48:04.685
Goddamn Ford is still
off the grid in Paris.

1049
00:48:04.718 --> 00:48:05.853
I know because
he keeps trying

1050
00:48:05.886 --> 00:48:08.222
to hack into our
system for intel.

1051
00:48:08.256 --> 00:48:10.124
He's like a dog that gets
loose from his yard...

1052
00:48:10.158 --> 00:48:11.592
and keeps humping
and shitting his way

1053
00:48:11.625 --> 00:48:12.927
through the neighborhood.

1054
00:48:12.961 --> 00:48:13.861
Would be a lot easier if...

1055
00:48:13.894 --> 00:48:15.096
Oh, my God!

1056
00:48:15.729 --> 00:48:16.729
Oh!

1057
00:48:17.331 --> 00:48:18.566
Okay.

1058
00:48:18.599 --> 00:48:20.101
Ford's is bigger.

1059
00:48:20.134 --> 00:48:21.235
This is uncomfortable.

1060
00:48:22.636 --> 00:48:24.538
Why do they always point at it?
We can see it.

1061
00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:28.509
He's dead though, isn't he?
Aw. That's a waste.

1062
00:48:28.542 --> 00:48:30.044
Oh, God. A video.

1063
00:48:30.078 --> 00:48:31.512
I can only imagine
what this is.

1064
00:48:31.545 --> 00:48:33.047
You get
everything on camera.

1065
00:48:33.081 --> 00:48:34.515
Base out of the hotel,

1066
00:48:34.548 --> 00:48:35.683
and go back there
after the attack.

1067
00:48:35.716 --> 00:48:36.756
I'll take Renaldo to Rome.

1068
00:48:36.951 --> 00:48:38.386
"Renaldo."

1069
00:48:38.419 --> 00:48:39.920
Do we have a record
of anyone with that name?

1070
00:48:39.954 --> 00:48:41.474
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Nicola.

1071
00:48:43.024 --> 00:48:44.358
Are you
listening to me?

1072
00:48:44.392 --> 00:48:46.160
I was just testing
the camera.

1073
00:48:46.194 --> 00:48:48.229
Stop it!
Find Ford!

1074
00:48:53.667 --> 00:48:55.169
Wow.
Oh...

1075
00:48:56.537 --> 00:48:58.206
Come on, what is wrong
with this person?

1076
00:48:58.739 --> 00:49:00.108
Oh, damn it.

1077
00:49:00.141 --> 00:49:02.743
Well, now the screen's
frozen. Hang on.

1078
00:49:02.776 --> 00:49:04.178
Come on,
not the hourglass.

1079
00:49:04.212 --> 00:49:05.612
Cooper, put down
the goddamn camera.

1080
00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:07.881
Nancy, can you pull up

1081
00:49:07.915 --> 00:49:11.119
Fine's POV cam
from Boyanov's office?

1082
00:49:11.152 --> 00:49:12.520
Look on the desk.
There's some photos there.

1083
00:49:12.553 --> 00:49:14.513
See if you find one of him
standing next to a car.

1084
00:49:23.164 --> 00:49:24.498
Renaldo is a Rolls-Royce.

1085
00:49:24.532 --> 00:49:26.034
Hack into the Rolls'
tracking system.

1086
00:49:26.067 --> 00:49:27.268
That car is a Wraith,

1087
00:49:27.301 --> 00:49:29.270
so it has a satellite-aided
transmission.

1088
00:49:29.303 --> 00:49:30.771
Then tap into Boyanov's feed.

1089
00:49:30.804 --> 00:49:32.073
His GPS should tell you

1090
00:49:32.106 --> 00:49:33.974
exactly where De Luca
is in Rome, right now.

1091
00:49:34.008 --> 00:49:35.476
I'm gonna head
to the airport.

1092
00:49:35.509 --> 00:49:36.744
Forget it, Cooper.

1093
00:49:36.777 --> 00:49:38.079
You're coming back
immediately.

1094
00:49:38.112 --> 00:49:40.048
Ma'am, I really think
I can do this.

1095
00:49:40.081 --> 00:49:41.849
And I'm not one
to toot my own horn,

1096
00:49:41.882 --> 00:49:43.317
but you know what?
I'm gonna toot...

1097
00:49:43.351 --> 00:49:45.686
and say that I just saved
a lot of people.

1098
00:49:45.719 --> 00:49:47.559
We are so close to getting
Rayna and that bomb.

1099
00:49:48.556 --> 00:49:49.796
Pull back the rug
in the corner.

1100
00:49:50.258 --> 00:49:51.258
Oh...

1101
00:49:55.096 --> 00:49:56.764
You'll be given
a new identity.

1102
00:49:56.797 --> 00:49:57.797
Oh, thank God.

1103
00:49:58.966 --> 00:50:00.234
Oh, no!

1104
00:50:00.268 --> 00:50:02.002
Your name is Penny Morgan.

1105
00:50:02.036 --> 00:50:03.704
You're a divorced
housewife from Iowa.

1106
00:50:03.737 --> 00:50:05.806
You've sold
more Mary Kay products...

1107
00:50:05.839 --> 00:50:07.308
than anyone else
in your state...

1108
00:50:07.341 --> 00:50:08.909
and you've traded in
the free car you've won...

1109
00:50:08.942 --> 00:50:10.811
to fund a trip
through Europe.

1110
00:50:10.844 --> 00:50:12.746
My hobbies are decoupage
and needlepoint.

1111
00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.748
I collect porcelain dolls...

1112
00:50:14.782 --> 00:50:16.750
and I'm the vice president
of the Ames Garden Club.

1113
00:50:16.784 --> 00:50:18.219
I couldn't even be president?

1114
00:50:18.252 --> 00:50:20.088
Maybe I should just be married
to one of the dolls...

1115
00:50:20.121 --> 00:50:22.056
just to make it extra sad.

1116
00:50:22.090 --> 00:50:23.924
Ten cats.
Why do I have ten cats?

1117
00:50:23.957 --> 00:50:26.026
Is that even legal?

1118
00:50:26.060 --> 00:50:29.029
Fine always got to be
a businessman.

1119
00:50:29.063 --> 00:50:30.764
One time
he was a race car driver.

1120
00:50:30.798 --> 00:50:31.878
Well, there's the ten cats.

1121
00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.135
Just missing a shirt
that says

1122
00:50:34.168 --> 00:50:35.936
I've never felt
the touch of a man.

1123
00:50:35.969 --> 00:50:37.338
Cooper, you're right.

1124
00:50:37.371 --> 00:50:39.039
You did good work back there.

1125
00:50:39.073 --> 00:50:40.574
That would have been
a real mess.

1126
00:50:40.608 --> 00:50:42.443
Thank you, ma'am.

1127
00:50:42.476 --> 00:50:44.878
You still went
with the cat lady.

1128
00:50:44.912 --> 00:50:46.114
It was already
in the floor.

1129
00:50:46.614 --> 00:50:47.781
Ah.

1130
00:51:18.078 --> 00:51:20.214
Great, that's a real
confidence builder.

1131
00:51:20.248 --> 00:51:21.882
Did you find De Luca?

1132
00:51:21.915 --> 00:51:23.155
He's been
at the Majestic Hotel,

1133
00:51:23.184 --> 00:51:24.685
but he's just left,
heading...

1134
00:51:24.718 --> 00:51:26.120
south, okay?

1135
00:51:26.154 --> 00:51:27.255
I'll guide you to him.

1136
00:51:27.288 --> 00:51:28.922
I've sent an ally
to drive you.

1137
00:51:28.956 --> 00:51:31.492
Elaine said nothing fancy,
so I've gone with earthy.

1138
00:51:36.564 --> 00:51:37.564
Ooh. Whoa.

1139
00:51:39.233 --> 00:51:40.301
You wanna stop the car?

1140
00:51:41.969 --> 00:51:43.171
Hi.

1141
00:51:46.307 --> 00:51:47.308
Hey!

1142
00:51:48.942 --> 00:51:50.077
Oh.

1143
00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.078
Welcome to Roma!

1144
00:51:51.111 --> 00:51:52.180
Thank you.

1145
00:51:53.147 --> 00:51:54.282
Thank you.

1146
00:51:55.449 --> 00:51:57.151
I'm Aldo.

1147
00:51:57.185 --> 00:51:59.720
Like the shoe store
found in American malls.

1148
00:52:00.988 --> 00:52:02.190
I'm Penny, like the penny.

1149
00:52:02.623 --> 00:52:04.024
Like a penny!

1150
00:52:04.057 --> 00:52:05.058
Or like penne alla vodka!

1151
00:52:05.092 --> 00:52:06.294
Okay.

1152
00:52:07.161 --> 00:52:08.596
Did you just grab my butt?

1153
00:52:09.062 --> 00:52:10.398
Yes.

1154
00:52:10.431 --> 00:52:13.100
Come. We need
to get you to De Luca.

1155
00:52:17.371 --> 00:52:18.839
Jiminy Christmas!

1156
00:52:23.043 --> 00:52:24.043
Oh, my God!

1157
00:52:26.614 --> 00:52:27.915
Don't worry, I have you!
Ah!

1158
00:52:30.083 --> 00:52:31.485
Aldo, slow down!

1159
00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.788
Nancy, are you sure this guy
is even an agent?

1160
00:52:34.822 --> 00:52:36.290
Absolutely.
He's the best!

1161
00:52:37.725 --> 00:52:39.827
There have been some
complaints filed against him.

1162
00:52:41.429 --> 00:52:43.364
Watch the road,
watch the road!

1163
00:52:43.397 --> 00:52:44.898
Watch the road!
Oh, my God!

1164
00:52:44.932 --> 00:52:46.166
Watch the road!

1165
00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.400
Wow, Aldo is making
great time.

1166
00:52:55.943 --> 00:52:56.943
A dead end!

1167
00:52:58.312 --> 00:52:59.780
This can't be right!

1168
00:52:59.813 --> 00:53:00.813
Oh, my God!

1169
00:53:09.957 --> 00:53:11.225
Ah! God!

1170
00:53:11.259 --> 00:53:13.126
Intriguing lady,
we are here.

1171
00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.028
Now, you must go...

1172
00:53:15.062 --> 00:53:17.565
because I fear if I stare

1173
00:53:17.598 --> 00:53:20.401
into your beautiful green
eyes a moment longer...

1174
00:53:20.434 --> 00:53:21.969
I will fall in love.

1175
00:53:22.002 --> 00:53:23.837
Oh! Too late.

1176
00:53:23.871 --> 00:53:25.172
My God, does
that ever work?

1177
00:53:25.205 --> 00:53:26.874
I will take that as...

1178
00:53:26.907 --> 00:53:28.108
That's a "no."

1179
00:53:28.141 --> 00:53:29.221
A "no."
Take that as a "no."

1180
00:53:41.489 --> 00:53:43.324
You were
just hitting on me.

1181
00:53:43.357 --> 00:53:44.458
I like to play the odds.
Yeah. Well, good luck.

1182
00:53:45.092 --> 00:53:46.794
Here is my phone number.

1183
00:53:46.827 --> 00:53:49.430
Memorize it, then burn it.

1184
00:53:49.463 --> 00:53:53.367
These people we are dealing
with, they like to...

1185
00:53:53.401 --> 00:53:56.570
How you say?
Murder entire families.

1186
00:53:56.604 --> 00:53:58.306
Do you have
something for me?

1187
00:53:58.339 --> 00:54:00.574
Do I have something
for you?

1188
00:54:00.608 --> 00:54:01.888
Would you like
something from me?

1189
00:54:02.209 --> 00:54:03.777
Not that.

1190
00:54:03.811 --> 00:54:05.713
What do you want from me?

1191
00:54:05.746 --> 00:54:08.015
You're supposed to have an
envelope with my gun in it.

1192
00:54:08.048 --> 00:54:09.583
I don't have a gun.

1193
00:54:09.617 --> 00:54:13.321
I am just aroused
from looking at you.

1194
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:17.024
It was joke.

1195
00:54:17.057 --> 00:54:18.526
There is no gun.

1196
00:54:18.559 --> 00:54:20.828
They said you would no longer
be needing one.

1197
00:54:20.861 --> 00:54:21.861
Good luck!

1198
00:54:23.831 --> 00:54:24.831
Ciao!

1199
00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.403
Good gravy. Was Pepe
Le Pew not available?

1200
00:54:29.437 --> 00:54:30.671
Stop
complaining, Suzie.

1201
00:54:30.704 --> 00:54:32.940
You're getting more action
than I have had in days.

1202
00:54:32.973 --> 00:54:34.274
Months.

1203
00:54:34.308 --> 00:54:36.109
Years.
Three years and 40 days.

1204
00:54:36.143 --> 00:54:37.778
Do we have an update
on De Luca?

1205
00:54:37.811 --> 00:54:39.179
Yes, he should be
pulling up...

1206
00:54:39.212 --> 00:54:40.848
right about now.

1207
00:54:48.322 --> 00:54:51.024
Oh, wow. He is hot.

1208
00:54:51.058 --> 00:54:53.026
I'm not gonna lie to you. I don't
think I can be objective anymore.

1209
00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:55.596
I'm rooting for that guy.
I want him to win.

1210
00:54:55.629 --> 00:54:56.989
I'm joking, Susan.
Don't report me.

1211
00:54:58.399 --> 00:54:59.767
He's handsy.

1212
00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:03.170
Let's set up camp in
the pastry shop behind you.

1213
00:55:03.203 --> 00:55:05.373
According to Aldo, De Luca
spends all night in the casino.

1214
00:55:05.406 --> 00:55:07.107
I'm going in, Nancy.

1215
00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:08.609
Susan, you heard Elaine.

1216
00:55:08.642 --> 00:55:11.745
Track and report.
No contact!

1217
00:55:11.779 --> 00:55:14.348
I'll track De Luca inside,
then I'll report.

1218
00:55:14.382 --> 00:55:16.484
And if he initiates
contact with me...

1219
00:55:17.284 --> 00:55:19.086
I'll just go with it.
Susan!

1220
00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:21.188
Your "cat lady" look is not
gonna fit in in there.

1221
00:55:21.221 --> 00:55:23.357
That's why Penny Morgan is
gonna burn her cat T-shirt...

1222
00:55:23.391 --> 00:55:25.025
and spend some
of that Mary Kay money.

1223
00:55:25.058 --> 00:55:26.460
This is full-blown rogue!

1224
00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:28.996
♪ Yeah, I'm a diva

1225
00:55:29.029 --> 00:55:31.031
♪ Living in the club
I don't need nobody

1226
00:55:31.899 --> 00:55:33.601
♪ I'm doing my own thing

1227
00:55:33.634 --> 00:55:36.036
♪ All I really want
to do is party

1228
00:55:42.209 --> 00:55:44.845
You guys are terrible!

1229
00:55:44.878 --> 00:55:46.847
I really hope De Luca is still
in there, for your sake.

1230
00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:48.749
And they're not gonna
reimburse you for all that.

1231
00:55:48.782 --> 00:55:50.217
You should have gone
to cheaper stores, Susan.

1232
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:51.952
Okay, I'm going offline,
Nancy.

1233
00:55:51.985 --> 00:55:53.086
No, wait!

1234
00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.120
Susan!

1235
00:55:55.322 --> 00:55:56.757
♪ I'm a diva

1236
00:55:56.790 --> 00:55:58.526
♪ Doing my thing
Don't need nobody ♪

1237
00:56:00.394 --> 00:56:02.362
Well, buongiorno, boys!

1238
00:56:02.396 --> 00:56:05.399
If I'm not out in 10 minutes,
it's because I won the place.

1239
00:56:05.433 --> 00:56:07.635
Let me just
rub that for luck.

1240
00:56:07.668 --> 00:56:09.670
Oh, that's an oily scalp.

1241
00:56:19.513 --> 00:56:21.715
I'm sorry, but I have
to check you in.

1242
00:56:22.916 --> 00:56:25.218
Your name, please?
Penny Morgan.

1243
00:56:25.252 --> 00:56:27.555
I don't see you on the list.
I'm so sorry.

1244
00:56:27.588 --> 00:56:29.289
She's with me.

1245
00:56:29.322 --> 00:56:31.191
Darling.

1246
00:56:31.224 --> 00:56:33.527
You're late.
The way you look...

1247
00:56:33.561 --> 00:56:36.063
I'd say it was more
than worth the wait. Come.

1248
00:56:36.096 --> 00:56:37.465
Let's get a drink.
Ow. Ow.

1249
00:56:37.498 --> 00:56:39.232
Such a gentleman.

1250
00:56:39.266 --> 00:56:41.769
You look absolutely stunning
tonight here, darling.

1251
00:56:41.802 --> 00:56:43.437
What the fuck are you doing
in here, arsehole?

1252
00:56:43.471 --> 00:56:44.672
That's quite a tone
change, isn't it?

1253
00:56:44.705 --> 00:56:46.173
What are you doing in here?

1254
00:56:46.206 --> 00:56:48.375
You are completely
compromising me right now.

1255
00:56:48.408 --> 00:56:50.177
I'm compromising you?
Fucking hilarious.

1256
00:56:50.210 --> 00:56:51.378
You were about
to cause a scene

1257
00:56:51.411 --> 00:56:52.580
trying to get into
this fucking place.

1258
00:56:52.613 --> 00:56:54.181
Give me a little credit. What
do you think I'm gonna do?

1259
00:56:54.214 --> 00:56:55.583
Run over there and be like,
"Hey, I'm a crazy lady!

1260
00:56:55.616 --> 00:56:57.217
"Where's the buffet?
I'm from the Midwest.

1261
00:56:57.250 --> 00:56:58.686
"Where's Blue Man Group?"

1262
00:56:58.719 --> 00:57:00.954
I am not an idiot, Ford.
You are an idiot.

1263
00:57:00.988 --> 00:57:02.289
You should not be
in this casino...

1264
00:57:02.322 --> 00:57:04.257
because De Luca is here and
I need to get close to him.

1265
00:57:04.291 --> 00:57:06.460
How you gonna do that? How
you gonna do that, Cooper?

1266
00:57:06.494 --> 00:57:07.427
What, are you gonna
seduce him?

1267
00:57:07.461 --> 00:57:08.596
That your big fucking plan?

1268
00:57:08.629 --> 00:57:09.930
Yeah, what if it is?

1269
00:57:09.963 --> 00:57:11.364
Why is that so hard
to believe?

1270
00:57:11.398 --> 00:57:13.200
Because you look like a flute
player in a wedding band.

1271
00:57:13.233 --> 00:57:14.568
That's fucking why!

1272
00:57:14.602 --> 00:57:16.436
I'm here to take De Luca out.

1273
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:18.606
Ooh. It sounds romantic.
I hope you get lucky!

1274
00:57:18.639 --> 00:57:20.407
God damn it, if I was trying
to sound romantic...

1275
00:57:20.440 --> 00:57:22.576
you'd be lying on the floor,
soaking wet and breathless...

1276
00:57:22.610 --> 00:57:23.944
wondering what came over you.

1277
00:57:23.977 --> 00:57:26.379
But I'm not, so get the
fuck out of my way!

1278
00:57:26.413 --> 00:57:28.415
I need you to rein it in,
buddy, okay?

1279
00:57:28.448 --> 00:57:30.417
If you take out De Luca, we don't
have a shot at getting Rayna.

1280
00:57:30.450 --> 00:57:32.520
So take it down, like,
5,000 notches!

1281
00:57:32.553 --> 00:57:33.721
Take it down?
That's how you get

1282
00:57:33.754 --> 00:57:34.955
polonium-210 slipped
into your drink...

1283
00:57:34.988 --> 00:57:36.423
and go 18 months
in intensive care

1284
00:57:36.456 --> 00:57:37.658
for radiation poisoning...

1285
00:57:37.691 --> 00:57:39.560
and go six months
without eyesight...

1286
00:57:39.593 --> 00:57:41.762
while everybody you've
ever loved is gunned down!

1287
00:57:41.795 --> 00:57:43.731
Really? Everybody
that you love

1288
00:57:43.764 --> 00:57:45.065
has been gunned down,
and just you survive?

1289
00:57:45.098 --> 00:57:46.066
Did you ever think that maybe

1290
00:57:46.099 --> 00:57:47.467
everybody you love
is not being killed...

1291
00:57:47.501 --> 00:57:48.936
but they're
killing themselves

1292
00:57:48.969 --> 00:57:51.004
because they can't stand
to be around you?

1293
00:57:51.038 --> 00:57:52.640
This shit's the real deal,
life and death.

1294
00:57:52.673 --> 00:57:54.542
This, the field...

1295
00:57:54.575 --> 00:57:56.343
is a hell of a lot different than
sitting behind your fucking monitor...

1296
00:57:56.376 --> 00:57:57.477
googling shit.

1297
00:57:57.511 --> 00:57:58.779
Stay away from me, Ford.

1298
00:57:58.812 --> 00:58:00.347
And do not let
De Luca see you.

1299
00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:01.749
And by the way,
I can see your gun

1300
00:58:01.782 --> 00:58:03.116
sticking out
of your back pocket.

1301
00:58:03.150 --> 00:58:05.719
Unless you're so extreme that
you've got a second dick...

1302
00:58:05.753 --> 00:58:06.820
coming out of your hip!

1303
00:58:39.186 --> 00:58:40.287
Konnichiwa.

1304
00:58:41.622 --> 00:58:43.456
Ma'am,
these seats are reserved.

1305
00:58:43.490 --> 00:58:44.858
Of course they are.

1306
00:58:45.959 --> 00:58:47.394
I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait outside.

1307
00:58:47.427 --> 00:58:49.029
Yes, absolutely.

1308
00:58:49.062 --> 00:58:50.263
Nope, not a door?

1309
00:58:51.498 --> 00:58:53.634
I knew that.
Of course it's not a door.

1310
00:58:53.667 --> 00:58:54.968
It probably
happens all the time.

1311
00:58:55.002 --> 00:58:56.604
It's never happened before.
Okay.

1312
00:58:58.505 --> 00:58:59.773
Ma'am.
Yes.

1313
00:59:02.175 --> 00:59:05.412
Now, right here is okay.
No more exploring, please.

1314
00:59:05.445 --> 00:59:06.880
Okay. Lovely.

1315
00:59:13.588 --> 00:59:15.189
From Mr. De Luca.

1316
00:59:19.460 --> 00:59:20.460
Nancy?

1317
00:59:21.095 --> 00:59:22.864
Susan. Oh, my God! Hi!

1318
00:59:22.897 --> 00:59:24.332
I found her.

1319
00:59:24.365 --> 00:59:26.034
I found Rayna.
She's with De Luca.

1320
00:59:26.067 --> 00:59:27.401
You did it!

1321
00:59:27.435 --> 00:59:29.170
Excellent tracking
and reporting, madam.

1322
00:59:43.952 --> 00:59:45.453
Oh, my God.

1323
00:59:45.486 --> 00:59:47.555
Somebody just put
something in her drink.

1324
00:59:47.588 --> 00:59:49.190
What is it?
Is it poison?

1325
00:59:49.223 --> 00:59:50.759
I don't think
it's a fiber supplement.

1326
00:59:50.792 --> 00:59:52.827
She killed Fine, Nance.

1327
00:59:52.861 --> 00:59:56.397
I could really enjoy just
watching her die right now.

1328
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:58.599
She's the only one who knows
where the bomb is...

1329
00:59:58.633 --> 01:00:00.001
so Dudaev would never
get his hands on it.

1330
01:00:00.034 --> 01:00:01.102
Oh, God, Susan.

1331
01:00:01.135 --> 01:00:02.135
What are you gonna do?

1332
01:00:03.705 --> 01:00:04.939
Excuse me, ma'am.

1333
01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:07.876
Hi, do you speak English?

1334
01:00:07.909 --> 01:00:10.378
Because I think somebody just
put a roofie in your cocktail.

1335
01:00:11.345 --> 01:00:12.747
Are you sure
it wasn't you?

1336
01:00:12.781 --> 01:00:14.983
What? No! God, I would never!

1337
01:00:15.784 --> 01:00:17.118
Could you point
the man out?

1338
01:00:17.151 --> 01:00:20.354
He just kind of
zipped out that door.

1339
01:00:20.388 --> 01:00:22.356
He's wearing a purple bowtie.

1340
01:00:28.429 --> 01:00:30.164
Thank you, Miss...

1341
01:00:30.198 --> 01:00:32.934
Oh. Penny. Morgan.

1342
01:00:32.967 --> 01:00:35.236
But it's no trouble, really.

1343
01:00:35.269 --> 01:00:38.106
I think us ladies have to
watch out for each other.

1344
01:00:38.139 --> 01:00:40.008
This kind of thing
happens all the time.

1345
01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:43.044
People often try
to roofie you?

1346
01:00:43.077 --> 01:00:44.813
Once, I asked someone
for a Tylenol,

1347
01:00:44.846 --> 01:00:47.015
and they gave me
a Tylenol PM.

1348
01:00:47.048 --> 01:00:48.888
I'm not sure what
their intentions were, but...

1349
01:00:53.554 --> 01:00:54.756
It seems
they may have found him.

1350
01:00:54.789 --> 01:00:56.309
Would you come with me
to identify him?

1351
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:58.693
Yes. Of course.

1352
01:00:58.727 --> 01:00:59.928
I'm happy to help.

1353
01:01:04.766 --> 01:01:06.267
Holy shit.

1354
01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:13.942
My friend here
said she saw you

1355
01:01:13.975 --> 01:01:15.643
put something in my drink.

1356
01:01:15.676 --> 01:01:17.345
I don't know
any of you people. Okay?

1357
01:01:17.378 --> 01:01:19.113
I'm just in Rome
on business.

1358
01:01:19.147 --> 01:01:21.482
I was about to head back
to my hotel and go to sleep.

1359
01:01:21.515 --> 01:01:25.086
Perfect. Just in time
for a nightcap.

1360
01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.420
Apparently, there's nothing
wrong with it.

1361
01:01:26.454 --> 01:01:27.454
I don't want your drink.

1362
01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.102
Fuck you, Rayna.

1363
01:01:43.471 --> 01:01:44.773
Mmm. Scrumptious.

1364
01:01:46.207 --> 01:01:48.042
So, joke's on you.

1365
01:01:52.146 --> 01:01:53.447
Fuck you!

1366
01:01:55.750 --> 01:01:57.385
Fuck you!

1367
01:02:21.375 --> 01:02:22.610
How long was I out?

1368
01:02:22.643 --> 01:02:24.312
You fainted just long enough
for us to laugh at you.

1369
01:02:24.345 --> 01:02:25.847
What happened?

1370
01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:26.881
It was all a dream.

1371
01:02:28.182 --> 01:02:30.084
I'm just kidding.
A man's throat dissolved.

1372
01:02:30.118 --> 01:02:32.286
Sorry, I'm not usually,
you know...

1373
01:02:34.322 --> 01:02:35.957
Oh, thank you. That's...

1374
01:02:37.425 --> 01:02:39.393
surprisingly polite.

1375
01:02:39.427 --> 01:02:40.995
Sorry about that.

1376
01:02:41.029 --> 01:02:43.064
I've seen a lot of things
in my day. I just haven't...

1377
01:02:43.097 --> 01:02:45.599
I have never seen that,
exactly.

1378
01:02:45.633 --> 01:02:48.002
Penny, do you feel the need

1379
01:02:48.036 --> 01:02:49.596
to tell anybody about
what you just saw?

1380
01:02:53.074 --> 01:02:54.575
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

1381
01:02:54.608 --> 01:02:57.278
That asshole
got what he deserved.

1382
01:02:57.311 --> 01:02:59.780
I knew from the second
I saw him, I thought...

1383
01:02:59.814 --> 01:03:01.214
"That guy doesn't
deserve a throat."

1384
01:03:01.582 --> 01:03:02.884
So, good on you.

1385
01:03:05.186 --> 01:03:08.022
I would like to take you
to dinner to say thank you.

1386
01:03:08.056 --> 01:03:10.291
And we must discuss
this hideous dress.

1387
01:03:10.324 --> 01:03:11.993
It's just hysterical.

1388
01:03:12.026 --> 01:03:15.263
Oh, good,
that's what I was hoping for.

1389
01:03:15.796 --> 01:03:18.432
And by the way...

1390
01:03:18.466 --> 01:03:20.434
Hristo was supposed to be
looking after me at the bar...

1391
01:03:20.468 --> 01:03:22.403
and making sure nobody
put anything in my drinks.

1392
01:03:27.942 --> 01:03:29.810
They'll give him
a talking-to.

1393
01:03:29.844 --> 01:03:32.780
Seems fair.
Maybe dock him a day's wage.

1394
01:03:32.813 --> 01:03:33.747
Or shoot him in the head.

1395
01:03:33.781 --> 01:03:34.949
That always works.

1396
01:03:36.417 --> 01:03:37.751
Rome is quite amaz...

1397
01:03:37.785 --> 01:03:38.920
Rome is the worst.
Yes.

1398
01:03:38.953 --> 01:03:40.889
So boring and tacky.

1399
01:03:40.922 --> 01:03:43.958
I'm so glad one of us
finally said it.

1400
01:03:43.992 --> 01:03:45.232
You have lipstick
on your teeth.

1401
01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:47.095
Really?

1402
01:03:47.128 --> 01:03:48.528
Looks like you ate
a box of crayons.

1403
01:03:48.662 --> 01:03:49.662
Damn it.

1404
01:03:50.899 --> 01:03:53.001
Here we are.

1405
01:03:53.034 --> 01:03:54.735
These should have been brought
out when we first sat down.

1406
01:03:54.768 --> 01:03:56.637
That's exactly
what I was thinking.

1407
01:03:56.670 --> 01:04:00.008
So far, I'm riddled with
disappointment at the service.

1408
01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:02.476
So sorry.
Signora, I apologize.

1409
01:04:05.779 --> 01:04:07.815
I once saw someone eat...

1410
01:04:07.848 --> 01:04:10.919
one of these before.

1411
01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:15.723
This is... strange.

1412
01:04:15.756 --> 01:04:17.591
Do you always tear your food
up into little pieces?

1413
01:04:17.625 --> 01:04:19.260
You look like a squirrel.

1414
01:04:19.293 --> 01:04:21.529
I was just checking
for the consistency.

1415
01:04:23.431 --> 01:04:24.698
Mmm.

1416
01:04:24.732 --> 01:04:26.300
You eat like a baby.

1417
01:04:26.334 --> 01:04:27.468
Thank you.

1418
01:04:27.501 --> 01:04:31.139
So, do you like to have a
look at the wine list?

1419
01:04:31.172 --> 01:04:32.640
Yes. Penny, you can order.

1420
01:04:33.942 --> 01:04:35.076
Okay. Oh!

1421
01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:36.978
Has some heft.

1422
01:04:37.345 --> 01:04:38.412
Okay.

1423
01:04:38.446 --> 01:04:40.915
I'm feeling a red.

1424
01:04:40.949 --> 01:04:42.984
Kind of a red.
I like a lot of noise.

1425
01:04:43.017 --> 01:04:44.585
I like a little bit of...

1426
01:04:44.618 --> 01:04:46.187
kind of a barky finish.

1427
01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:47.621
I tend to like a white...

1428
01:04:47.655 --> 01:04:50.724
with the grit of a hummus...

1429
01:04:50.758 --> 01:04:53.227
that's, of course,
been thinned out.

1430
01:04:53.261 --> 01:04:55.930
Just kind of jump up
in the front of your palate...

1431
01:04:55.964 --> 01:04:58.399
and then rip back
and sizzle.

1432
01:04:58.432 --> 01:05:02.336
Almost a mineral
kind of dirt finish...

1433
01:05:02.370 --> 01:05:05.974
if we're having meat. Okay,
here, this is looking...

1434
01:05:06.007 --> 01:05:08.076
promising.
Something with...

1435
01:05:08.109 --> 01:05:10.011
This one has
nice hints of toast...

1436
01:05:10.844 --> 01:05:13.281
and dogwood,
I assume? Hmm?

1437
01:05:13.314 --> 01:05:14.682
Uh...

1438
01:05:14.715 --> 01:05:18.419
I will have
the Sapori e Delizie.

1439
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.488
Right.

1440
01:05:20.521 --> 01:05:22.756
That is the name
of this restaurant.

1441
01:05:22.790 --> 01:05:24.292
Yes, I'm aware of that.

1442
01:05:24.325 --> 01:05:26.560
So, why don't you
surprise us...

1443
01:05:26.594 --> 01:05:28.229
with something
that we don't know?

1444
01:05:28.262 --> 01:05:30.064
Like a delicious
bottle of wine.

1445
01:05:30.098 --> 01:05:32.967
Right. Sorry, I will be back
in five minutes, okay?

1446
01:05:33.001 --> 01:05:35.369
So hard to get
good help these days.

1447
01:05:35.403 --> 01:05:37.138
Don't you find that?
I find that.

1448
01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:41.675
I know who all
your active agents are.

1449
01:05:43.978 --> 01:05:46.014
Okay, I'm sensing, uh...

1450
01:05:46.914 --> 01:05:48.482
Can I do a little do over?

1451
01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:50.550
I, uh...

1452
01:05:51.319 --> 01:05:53.254
I really don't know
how to order wine.

1453
01:05:53.287 --> 01:05:56.991
I'm from a small town
in Iowa.

1454
01:05:57.025 --> 01:05:58.692
I saved up my money
to come on this Rome trip.

1455
01:05:58.726 --> 01:06:00.594
I had a little jar
on my desk at work...

1456
01:06:00.628 --> 01:06:02.063
and everybody said, "You're
never gonna make enough money."

1457
01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:04.098
But I did, and I'm here.

1458
01:06:04.132 --> 01:06:07.068
And then I meet you,
and I can't afford...

1459
01:06:07.101 --> 01:06:08.536
to eat at a place like this,

1460
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:10.404
and I'm just trying
to impress you...

1461
01:06:10.438 --> 01:06:12.340
and doing a really
poor job of it.

1462
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:15.909
I thought as much.

1463
01:06:15.943 --> 01:06:19.047
Your cheap prom dress doesn't
exactly scream sophistication.

1464
01:06:19.413 --> 01:06:20.881
Oh.

1465
01:06:20.914 --> 01:06:23.551
Well, I didn't go to prom,
so maybe it is...

1466
01:06:23.584 --> 01:06:25.153
When I was a little girl
growing up in Bulgaria...

1467
01:06:25.186 --> 01:06:27.421
which is the worst,
by the way.

1468
01:06:27.455 --> 01:06:30.524
Poor people everywhere and
cabbages constantly cooking.

1469
01:06:30.558 --> 01:06:33.094
There was this woman who was
kicked out of her house...

1470
01:06:33.127 --> 01:06:34.895
and she lost
all her money.

1471
01:06:34.928 --> 01:06:36.530
She couldn't even
sell her body.

1472
01:06:36.564 --> 01:06:39.533
So she became a clown
on the streets.

1473
01:06:39.567 --> 01:06:41.835
She would perform all her
tricks standing in mud,

1474
01:06:41.869 --> 01:06:44.072
and just cry and cry.

1475
01:06:45.306 --> 01:06:46.607
You remind me of this woman.

1476
01:06:47.608 --> 01:06:49.443
Oh. Thank you.

1477
01:06:49.477 --> 01:06:52.180
I don't know what it is, but
there's something about you.

1478
01:06:52.213 --> 01:06:55.116
The fainting,
the way you talk...

1479
01:06:55.149 --> 01:06:57.151
your terrible
sense of style.

1480
01:06:57.185 --> 01:06:59.320
I did get this at
quite a lovely...

1481
01:06:59.353 --> 01:07:00.488
It makes me sad
to think of you here

1482
01:07:00.521 --> 01:07:02.890
spending all your
savings on Rome.

1483
01:07:02.923 --> 01:07:05.093
Come on.
We're going to Budapest.

1484
01:07:05.559 --> 01:07:06.727
Budapest?

1485
01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.129
I have some business
to finish there...

1486
01:07:08.162 --> 01:07:10.131
and you can take my private
jet when we're done...

1487
01:07:10.164 --> 01:07:11.965
anywhere you want to
get home.

1488
01:07:11.999 --> 01:07:13.639
My way of repaying you
for saving my life.

1489
01:07:14.034 --> 01:07:15.236
Okay.

1490
01:07:19.773 --> 01:07:20.773
Is there a problem?

1491
01:07:25.913 --> 01:07:28.182
No. Not at all. Let's go.

1492
01:07:29.617 --> 01:07:31.085
Hey! Wait, what?

1493
01:07:31.119 --> 01:07:32.453
I'm just talking
to the girl!

1494
01:07:32.486 --> 01:07:33.846
Okay, okay.
Let's not make a scene.

1495
01:07:34.588 --> 01:07:36.324
Let me just
get my room key out...

1496
01:07:36.357 --> 01:07:38.459
and I'll grab a bag
and pack my things.

1497
01:07:38.492 --> 01:07:40.828
It's Susan.
She's sending a code.

1498
01:07:40.861 --> 01:07:41.829
No, they can
fly you back later.

1499
01:07:41.862 --> 01:07:43.297
"Shut...

1500
01:07:43.331 --> 01:07:44.665
And if the rest of your clothes
look like that dress...

1501
01:07:44.698 --> 01:07:46.066
"...down...

1502
01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:46.900
...I can send someone
to burn them for you.

1503
01:07:46.934 --> 01:07:48.269
Ha-ha.

1504
01:07:48.302 --> 01:07:49.670
"...the power."
Quite a zinger!

1505
01:07:52.806 --> 01:07:54.342
Shut down the power
to the Casino Di Rome.

1506
01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:55.375
What?

1507
01:07:56.744 --> 01:07:59.046
Shut the entire bloody
grid down, then! Now!

1508
01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:00.080
That would be great.

1509
01:08:04.618 --> 01:08:06.899
Everybody, please remain
calm and stay where you are.

1510
01:08:14.962 --> 01:08:16.430
Oh, no!
What's happening?

1511
01:08:25.773 --> 01:08:26.874
I've got this.

1512
01:08:28.142 --> 01:08:30.178
What the fuck just happened?

1513
01:08:31.712 --> 01:08:32.913
God damn it.

1514
01:08:32.946 --> 01:08:34.482
Oh, my God! Rayna.

1515
01:08:34.515 --> 01:08:35.816
Thank God
your hair broke your fall.

1516
01:08:35.849 --> 01:08:37.451
I don't know what happened.

1517
01:08:37.485 --> 01:08:39.487
The lights were going out, and I
don't know if it's a robbery.

1518
01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.356
Two of your guys slammed
into me and took you down.

1519
01:08:42.390 --> 01:08:44.592
I think one of them
touched my bottom.

1520
01:08:44.625 --> 01:08:46.705
I don't know which one,
but I definitely felt a hand.

1521
01:08:47.295 --> 01:08:49.363
Are they gonna be okay?

1522
01:08:49.397 --> 01:08:50.498
I wouldn't
worry about them.

1523
01:08:50.531 --> 01:08:52.300
Their fate has just
been sealed.

1524
01:08:54.268 --> 01:08:57.271
Sorry. I'll let you go.

1525
01:08:57.305 --> 01:08:58.306
Shame on you!

1526
01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:07.881
Wow.

1527
01:09:07.915 --> 01:09:10.951
This is a really jazzy plane.

1528
01:09:10.984 --> 01:09:12.620
Is this yours?

1529
01:09:12.653 --> 01:09:13.721
It was my father's.

1530
01:09:14.822 --> 01:09:16.590
You've never been
on a private jet before?

1531
01:09:16.624 --> 01:09:17.625
Oh, no.

1532
01:09:18.626 --> 01:09:20.728
I did get upgraded
to premium economy once...

1533
01:09:20.761 --> 01:09:23.130
which was pretty plush.

1534
01:09:23.163 --> 01:09:25.633
Premium economy.

1535
01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:27.201
Sounds like a pen
for dirty animals.

1536
01:09:27.235 --> 01:09:28.936
Yeah, probably.

1537
01:09:28.969 --> 01:09:31.739
But it was not
quite like this.

1538
01:09:31.772 --> 01:09:33.173
Thank you.

1539
01:09:34.141 --> 01:09:36.310
Why are you being
so nice to me?

1540
01:09:36.344 --> 01:09:37.945
Can't just be because
I remind you

1541
01:09:37.978 --> 01:09:39.847
of some sad Bulgarian clown.

1542
01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.249
You remind me of my mother.

1543
01:09:41.782 --> 01:09:42.782
Oh.

1544
01:09:43.551 --> 01:09:45.286
Really?

1545
01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:48.188
You know that you and I
are pretty close in age.

1546
01:09:48.222 --> 01:09:49.890
You're funny.

1547
01:09:49.923 --> 01:09:51.225
It's the Bulgarian
clown in you.

1548
01:09:51.259 --> 01:09:52.960
Okay.
She was marvelous.

1549
01:09:52.993 --> 01:09:54.795
But she was different.

1550
01:09:54.828 --> 01:09:55.929
Eccentric, like you are.

1551
01:09:55.963 --> 01:09:57.365
Oh.

1552
01:09:57.398 --> 01:09:58.432
The moment I saw you
standing there

1553
01:09:58.466 --> 01:09:59.600
in that abortion
of a dress...

1554
01:09:59.633 --> 01:10:00.801
Ah... Come on.

1555
01:10:00.834 --> 01:10:02.536
...it was as if to say...

1556
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:04.930
"This is what I've got, world.
It's hideous, but it's mine."

1557
01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.141
This was her.

1558
01:10:08.175 --> 01:10:09.710
Oh, wow.

1559
01:10:09.743 --> 01:10:11.245
Hey, how'd you get
that picture of me?

1560
01:10:11.279 --> 01:10:12.746
I look amazing.

1561
01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:14.748
Hello, doppelganger.

1562
01:10:14.782 --> 01:10:16.917
She was the only person
I could ever trust.

1563
01:10:16.950 --> 01:10:19.853
Well, here's to your mom.

1564
01:10:19.887 --> 01:10:21.955
To my mother. And to you.

1565
01:10:21.989 --> 01:10:23.557
And here's to you.

1566
01:10:23.591 --> 01:10:26.260
You may never
be as wise as an owl...

1567
01:10:26.294 --> 01:10:28.296
but you'll always
be a hoot to me.

1568
01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:31.499
What a stupid fucking
retarded toast.

1569
01:10:31.532 --> 01:10:32.966
You're delightful.
As are you.

1570
01:10:35.569 --> 01:10:36.737
Mmm.

1571
01:10:36.770 --> 01:10:39.740
Now, where did you say
we were headed?

1572
01:10:43.711 --> 01:10:44.711
Headed?

1573
01:10:45.779 --> 01:10:47.681
Did you say where?

1574
01:10:48.015 --> 01:10:49.783
Oh, God.

1575
01:10:49.817 --> 01:10:51.385
If you ever feel like
you have been poisoned...

1576
01:10:51.419 --> 01:10:52.920
chew one of these.

1577
01:10:52.953 --> 01:10:53.953
Chew one of these.

1578
01:11:09.303 --> 01:11:10.804
What happened?

1579
01:11:10.838 --> 01:11:12.172
I've never seen somebody

1580
01:11:12.205 --> 01:11:13.874
dive for
stool softener before.

1581
01:11:13.907 --> 01:11:15.943
That's one thing
that happened.

1582
01:11:15.976 --> 01:11:16.976
What did you do?

1583
01:11:18.011 --> 01:11:19.212
Did you drug me?

1584
01:11:19.246 --> 01:11:20.714
Of course I did.

1585
01:11:20.748 --> 01:11:22.350
I told you,
I can't trust anybody.

1586
01:11:22.383 --> 01:11:23.703
I had to look
through your things.

1587
01:11:23.817 --> 01:11:25.786
Anyway, tell me...

1588
01:11:25.819 --> 01:11:26.920
are your hemorrhoids
particularly large,

1589
01:11:26.954 --> 01:11:27.954
or just tenacious?

1590
01:11:28.356 --> 01:11:29.923
Stop texting!

1591
01:11:29.957 --> 01:11:31.892
I'm not texting,
if you must know.

1592
01:11:31.925 --> 01:11:34.261
I'm playing Candy Crush
and I just made level 95.

1593
01:11:34.294 --> 01:11:35.294
God, that is so rude!

1594
01:11:39.433 --> 01:11:41.134
Jesus, Colin,
what the fuck are you doing?

1595
01:11:41.168 --> 01:11:43.571
I'm sorry, Rayna, but there's
been a change of plans.

1596
01:11:43.604 --> 01:11:45.072
Who paid you off, Colin?

1597
01:11:45.105 --> 01:11:47.240
Colin hasn't worked here for,
like, eight months.

1598
01:11:47.274 --> 01:11:48.442
I'm Fredrick.

1599
01:11:48.476 --> 01:11:49.643
Is that why
you're doing this?

1600
01:11:49.677 --> 01:11:51.244
Because I don't remember
your fucking name?

1601
01:11:51.278 --> 01:11:52.546
Let's just say
there's some people

1602
01:11:52.580 --> 01:11:54.147
who really want
what you're selling.

1603
01:11:54.181 --> 01:11:55.949
You don't have to do this.

1604
01:11:55.983 --> 01:11:58.251
I can give you a very
comfortable life, Col...

1605
01:11:58.285 --> 01:11:59.887
Um...

1606
01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:01.288
You forgot my name again,
didn't you?

1607
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:02.322
No, I didn't.
Yeah.

1608
01:12:02.356 --> 01:12:04.291
It's...

1609
01:12:04.324 --> 01:12:05.926
Don't say fucking Colin.

1610
01:12:05.959 --> 01:12:08.496
Fuck! I don't give a shit
what your name is.

1611
01:12:08.529 --> 01:12:09.863
You're the fucking help!

1612
01:12:09.897 --> 01:12:12.500
Nice try, Colin... but Stan
and I already sold it to...

1613
01:12:12.533 --> 01:12:13.834
It's Fredrick!

1614
01:12:13.867 --> 01:12:14.867
Fredrick!

1615
01:12:18.372 --> 01:12:19.941
Sorry, lady, but they only
paid me for one...

1616
01:12:19.974 --> 01:12:20.974
Ow!

1617
01:12:28.049 --> 01:12:29.049
Come on!

1618
01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:33.755
Rayna! Go to the cockpit
and level us out!

1619
01:12:33.788 --> 01:12:35.428
Like I know how to fly
a fucking airplane!

1620
01:12:37.992 --> 01:12:38.993
That was weird.

1621
01:12:39.327 --> 01:12:40.429
Ah!

1622
01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:46.835
Blow that thing
all you want, lady.

1623
01:12:46.868 --> 01:12:49.303
Yeah? Why don't
you blow me, Colin.

1624
01:12:49.337 --> 01:12:51.540
Ow! It's Fredrick.

1625
01:12:57.211 --> 01:12:58.211
Ah!

1626
01:13:32.647 --> 01:13:33.882
Oh, for fuck's sake!

1627
01:13:35.116 --> 01:13:36.184
I got it.

1628
01:13:36.217 --> 01:13:37.217
I know what to do.

1629
01:13:41.089 --> 01:13:42.957
Are you okay?
No!

1630
01:13:42.991 --> 01:13:44.993
I've got a dead man's
head up my ass.

1631
01:13:45.026 --> 01:13:46.127
This one's for Fine.

1632
01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.160
Downdraft!

1633
01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:50.131
Not again!

1634
01:13:50.164 --> 01:13:52.066
Do you have any idea
what you're fucking doing?

1635
01:13:54.302 --> 01:13:55.670
The controls
are so sensitive.

1636
01:13:55.704 --> 01:13:57.639
Oh, God.

1637
01:13:57.672 --> 01:14:00.374
One of these dead fuckers
just shit his pants.

1638
01:14:00.408 --> 01:14:01.408
Okay, wait a minute.

1639
01:14:03.144 --> 01:14:04.278
I got it.

1640
01:14:04.312 --> 01:14:05.379
I think I got... Okay.

1641
01:14:05.413 --> 01:14:06.515
Okay.

1642
01:14:10.051 --> 01:14:13.522
Good thing I learned to use
that flight simulator app, huh?

1643
01:14:13.555 --> 01:14:16.057
Congratulations,
Penny Morgan.

1644
01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:17.659
You just blew your cover.

1645
01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:21.830
Now put the plane
on autopilot and get up.

1646
01:14:25.567 --> 01:14:27.802
Any bullshit, and I'll
blow your CIA brains

1647
01:14:27.836 --> 01:14:29.504
all over that control panel.

1648
01:14:29.538 --> 01:14:30.872
I know what
you're thinking.

1649
01:14:31.472 --> 01:14:32.674
And you're wrong.

1650
01:14:34.008 --> 01:14:36.210
My real name is...

1651
01:14:36.244 --> 01:14:38.146
Did you come up with
your spy name yet? No.

1652
01:14:38.179 --> 01:14:39.313
Mine would be...

1653
01:14:39.347 --> 01:14:41.049
Amber Valentine.

1654
01:14:41.082 --> 01:14:42.684
What are you, a porn star?

1655
01:14:43.618 --> 01:14:45.754
You're fucking
hilarious, huh?

1656
01:14:45.787 --> 01:14:47.421
I'm a private bodyguard,

1657
01:14:47.455 --> 01:14:48.657
and your father hired me
to protect you.

1658
01:14:48.690 --> 01:14:52.026
Bodyguard? You? Please.

1659
01:14:52.060 --> 01:14:54.162
That's funny, because the
way I see it, without me...

1660
01:14:54.195 --> 01:14:56.397
you would currently be crashed
in the Alps right now.

1661
01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:57.699
Or you'd be
laying in a morgue

1662
01:14:57.732 --> 01:14:58.900
with a hole burned
in your throat.

1663
01:14:58.933 --> 01:15:01.570
You little spoiled
piece of shit.

1664
01:15:01.603 --> 01:15:04.706
Why would my father hire
somebody like you?

1665
01:15:05.273 --> 01:15:07.408
Because he trusted me.

1666
01:15:07.441 --> 01:15:08.543
And for whatever
fucking reason,

1667
01:15:08.577 --> 01:15:10.712
he loved you.

1668
01:15:10.745 --> 01:15:12.881
Didn't even want you to know
I was watching you.

1669
01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:14.816
So he was the one
that made me come up

1670
01:15:14.849 --> 01:15:16.985
with this whole loser
Penny Morgan bullshit.

1671
01:15:17.018 --> 01:15:19.420
Yeah, "You look
just like my dead mama.

1672
01:15:19.453 --> 01:15:21.089
"Wah."

1673
01:15:21.122 --> 01:15:22.423
And fuck you for saying

1674
01:15:22.456 --> 01:15:25.660
I look anything
like that fucking beast.

1675
01:15:25.694 --> 01:15:27.696
No wonder your father
never had the son he wanted.

1676
01:15:27.729 --> 01:15:29.631
You fuck that monster once...

1677
01:15:29.664 --> 01:15:31.966
and you just drop
the fucking mic and walk out.

1678
01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.302
Fuck you. Everything
you've said is a lie.

1679
01:15:34.335 --> 01:15:35.870
Oh.

1680
01:15:35.904 --> 01:15:37.939
What happened? Did I hit
a little sore spot?

1681
01:15:37.972 --> 01:15:39.874
Yeah, he always wanted a
son, and you knew it.

1682
01:15:41.175 --> 01:15:43.311
Look, he wanted you
to take over the business.

1683
01:15:43.344 --> 01:15:46.014
He was just afraid you were
gonna get yourself killed.

1684
01:15:46.047 --> 01:15:48.316
So if you wanna live, and you
wanna unload that bomb...

1685
01:15:48.349 --> 01:15:49.851
you stick with me.

1686
01:15:49.884 --> 01:15:52.353
And if you got
a problem with that...

1687
01:15:52.386 --> 01:15:53.655
you know what you
can do, Rayna?

1688
01:15:56.224 --> 01:15:57.726
You and your bullshit accent

1689
01:15:57.759 --> 01:16:00.028
can land this fucking plane
by yourselves.

1690
01:16:01.963 --> 01:16:04.966
Okay, bodyguard.

1691
01:16:04.999 --> 01:16:07.201
But if I find out you're lying
to me about any of this...

1692
01:16:07.235 --> 01:16:10.238
I'll show you ways to die
you never even dreamed of.

1693
01:16:12.073 --> 01:16:15.309
Now, let's go to Budapest.
I need a fucking drink.

1694
01:16:15.343 --> 01:16:16.678
Yeah, I bet you fucking do.

1695
01:16:23.217 --> 01:16:24.653
Oh, my God.

1696
01:16:26.354 --> 01:16:31.425
♪ People want my power
And they want my station

1697
01:16:31.459 --> 01:16:36.197
♪ Stormed my winter palace
But they couldn't take it

1698
01:16:36.230 --> 01:16:40.068
♪ Try to pull my status
But they couldn't fake it ♪

1699
01:16:44.238 --> 01:16:46.074
Welcome back to the Four Seasons
Budapest, Miss Boyanov.

1700
01:16:46.107 --> 01:16:47.108
Don't talk to me.
You're not my friend.

1701
01:16:47.141 --> 01:16:48.176
Get away from me.

1702
01:16:48.209 --> 01:16:49.944
Move. Move! I got it.

1703
01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:53.948
So, what's the plan?
Who are we meeting?

1704
01:16:53.982 --> 01:16:55.950
You're my bodyguard,
not my business partner...

1705
01:16:55.984 --> 01:16:57.819
so just focus
on guarding my body.

1706
01:16:57.852 --> 01:16:59.520
So not knowing
who we're meeting tonight

1707
01:16:59.553 --> 01:17:00.588
is gonna make me
extra effective.

1708
01:17:00.621 --> 01:17:01.923
That's okay. I get it.

1709
01:17:01.956 --> 01:17:03.391
I got shit to do.
You'll probably be fine.

1710
01:17:03.424 --> 01:17:05.393
Why don't I go get you
a nice dress to be buried in?

1711
01:17:05.426 --> 01:17:06.426
Dumbass.

1712
01:17:07.996 --> 01:17:09.430
I'm meeting
a potential bidder,

1713
01:17:09.463 --> 01:17:11.132
if you must know.

1714
01:17:11.165 --> 01:17:12.633
If they don't top
the current offer,

1715
01:17:12.667 --> 01:17:13.827
the sale
will happen tomorrow.

1716
01:17:14.302 --> 01:17:15.303
Where?
I don't know yet.

1717
01:17:23.244 --> 01:17:24.212
Anton!

1718
01:17:24.245 --> 01:17:25.780
Ouch!

1719
01:17:25.814 --> 01:17:28.349
Anton is part of my
security team, psycho!

1720
01:17:28.382 --> 01:17:30.885
Yeah, well, guess what?
I don't like his face.

1721
01:17:30.919 --> 01:17:32.386
I don't like the looks
of your face!

1722
01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:33.988
And who the fuck are you?

1723
01:17:34.022 --> 01:17:35.790
I'm the person that's gonna
cut your dick off

1724
01:17:35.824 --> 01:17:37.625
and glue it
to your forehead...

1725
01:17:37.658 --> 01:17:38.626
so you look like
a limp-dick unicorn.

1726
01:17:38.659 --> 01:17:40.128
That's who the fuck I am.

1727
01:17:40.161 --> 01:17:41.662
Your name should be
"Mr. Bag o' Dicks"...

1728
01:17:41.696 --> 01:17:42.964
not "Anton."

1729
01:17:42.997 --> 01:17:46.100
Okay. Jesus.
Let's just calm down, okay?

1730
01:17:46.134 --> 01:17:48.636
Does he not look like a bag o' dicks?
Enough.

1731
01:17:48.669 --> 01:17:50.271
I can see why my father
liked you now.

1732
01:17:51.605 --> 01:17:53.274
Amber is my hired bodyguard.

1733
01:17:53.908 --> 01:17:55.810
Be more like her.

1734
01:17:55.844 --> 01:17:58.212
And your head better not have
broken my fucking phone.

1735
01:18:08.256 --> 01:18:09.991
We've got a big night
ahead of us.

1736
01:18:10.024 --> 01:18:11.860
Don't be afraid
to clean yourself up, Amber.

1737
01:18:11.893 --> 01:18:13.427
Take a shower
is what I'm saying.

1738
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:15.396
Yeah? Don't be afraid
to hit water yourself.

1739
01:18:15.429 --> 01:18:17.531
You smell like a dead hooker
that washed up on the beach...

1740
01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:18.833
then roasted in the sun
for a week

1741
01:18:18.867 --> 01:18:20.134
before anybody found
her body.

1742
01:18:20.168 --> 01:18:22.136
Okay. You need
to take it way down.

1743
01:18:22.170 --> 01:18:23.571
I'm sorry, that's too much.
Okay, that was too much.

1744
01:18:23.604 --> 01:18:24.939
Jeez!
Too much.

1745
01:18:24.973 --> 01:18:25.973
God.

1746
01:18:32.947 --> 01:18:34.048
What are you staring at?

1747
01:18:35.549 --> 01:18:37.218
I will destroy you.

1748
01:18:37.251 --> 01:18:38.619
And then after
I'm done destroying you,

1749
01:18:38.652 --> 01:18:40.789
I'll take a picture
of what's left...

1750
01:18:40.822 --> 01:18:42.957
of your body, and I'm gonna
text it to your mother.

1751
01:18:42.991 --> 01:18:44.893
With a little note that says
his last words were...

1752
01:18:44.926 --> 01:18:47.195
"My mother was terrible.
You did this to me."

1753
01:18:47.228 --> 01:18:48.329
That's so fucking mean.

1754
01:18:48.362 --> 01:18:49.597
Yeah, I'm so fucking mean.

1755
01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:50.664
You're just
figuring that out?

1756
01:18:50.698 --> 01:18:51.866
Give me your coat.

1757
01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:53.567
This is a man's coat.

1758
01:18:53.601 --> 01:18:55.603
Yeah, but I don't
see a man, do I?

1759
01:18:55.636 --> 01:18:57.371
I see a reject from
The Sound of Music.

1760
01:18:57.405 --> 01:19:00.608
It was my mother's coat,
but she's very masculine.

1761
01:19:00.641 --> 01:19:03.477
You look like ABBA took a shit
and put a trench coat on it.

1762
01:19:03.511 --> 01:19:05.379
Well, I won't
give it to you.

1763
01:19:05.413 --> 01:19:06.414
I've been in this dress
for 12 fucking hours.

1764
01:19:06.447 --> 01:19:07.447
Give me your coat.

1765
01:19:07.548 --> 01:19:09.050
No.

1766
01:19:09.083 --> 01:19:12.120
Yeah. No, I won't give...
This is my coat.

1767
01:19:12.153 --> 01:19:13.855
I'm gonna reach through
your fucking body...

1768
01:19:13.888 --> 01:19:15.790
and rip out your back
like a fucking werewolf.

1769
01:19:16.424 --> 01:19:17.992
Without tearing the jacket.

1770
01:19:18.026 --> 01:19:19.527
Just so I can
wear your jacket,

1771
01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:21.195
and give you a final
"Fuck you."

1772
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:22.696
Oh, no, you won't.

1773
01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:24.132
I'm gonna take
that fucking coat.

1774
01:19:25.399 --> 01:19:27.501
I warned you, you Swedish
gummy fish motherfucker!

1775
01:19:27.535 --> 01:19:28.535
Ouch!

1776
01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:33.975
Oh, my God.

1777
01:19:34.742 --> 01:19:35.944
Oh, my God.

1778
01:19:37.145 --> 01:19:38.813
Nance?
Oh, my God, Susan!

1779
01:19:38.847 --> 01:19:41.215
Hello. Hello?

1780
01:19:41.249 --> 01:19:42.550
Just say something
to me, please.

1781
01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:44.118
Susan? Anything.

1782
01:19:44.152 --> 01:19:45.954
I cannot handle this,
Susan!

1783
01:19:45.987 --> 01:19:47.355
There is nothing
in real life

1784
01:19:47.388 --> 01:19:48.456
that someone could
do to a spy...

1785
01:19:48.489 --> 01:19:50.658
that is filthier
or more upsetting

1786
01:19:50.691 --> 01:19:52.093
than what my brain
will cook up right now.

1787
01:19:52.126 --> 01:19:54.795
So save me from myself,
Susan!

1788
01:19:54.829 --> 01:19:55.897
Because you know
what's going to happen.

1789
01:19:55.930 --> 01:19:57.565
I'm gonna get chattier,
aren't I?

1790
01:19:57.598 --> 01:20:00.001
Did you know that you can't
ever change having big pores?

1791
01:20:00.034 --> 01:20:02.837
Oh, my God, Nancy,
you are driving me nuts!

1792
01:20:02.871 --> 01:20:05.039
I couldn't talk because I was in
an elevator filled with people.

1793
01:20:05.073 --> 01:20:07.241
You're all right.
Oh, thank God.

1794
01:20:07.275 --> 01:20:09.878
You disappeared for 12 hours.
We didn't know what happened!

1795
01:20:09.911 --> 01:20:12.246
I had to take out my earpiece
and my camera.

1796
01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.920
Rayna's on to our agents
and she was gonna

1797
01:20:13.948 --> 01:20:15.616
spot my equipment
from a mile away.

1798
01:20:15.649 --> 01:20:17.318
You're with Rayna?

1799
01:20:17.351 --> 01:20:19.954
You're not supposed to be
within a mile away of her.

1800
01:20:19.988 --> 01:20:21.489
Nancy, I know,
but I'm in deep

1801
01:20:21.522 --> 01:20:23.024
and I'm getting
such good intel.

1802
01:20:23.057 --> 01:20:24.392
Please,
I just need to remain

1803
01:20:24.425 --> 01:20:26.360
on radio silence
just a little bit longer.

1804
01:20:26.394 --> 01:20:27.828
Well, don't worry,
because I'll be able

1805
01:20:27.862 --> 01:20:29.130
to keep a better eye
on you now.

1806
01:20:29.163 --> 01:20:30.403
What are you
talking about? How?

1807
01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:33.968
What are you doing here?

1808
01:20:34.002 --> 01:20:35.636
Elaine wanted to know exactly
what you were up to...

1809
01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:38.172
so I tracked your earpiece.
They sent me here to find you.

1810
01:20:38.206 --> 01:20:39.473
They sent you?

1811
01:20:39.507 --> 01:20:40.909
I'm as unknown as you are,

1812
01:20:40.942 --> 01:20:42.110
so they thought
my cover was safe.

1813
01:20:42.143 --> 01:20:43.411
Did they give you
an identity?

1814
01:20:43.878 --> 01:20:45.413
It's so cool.

1815
01:20:45.446 --> 01:20:47.548
I said I wanted to be
Amber Valentine... What?

1816
01:20:47.581 --> 01:20:49.083
...and they let me use it.

1817
01:20:49.117 --> 01:20:50.251
I don't know why you got
to pick your identity.

1818
01:20:50.284 --> 01:20:51.752
I had to go
as a freaking cat lady.

1819
01:20:51.785 --> 01:20:52.887
- Amber!
- Yes?

1820
01:20:52.921 --> 01:20:54.255
Who is this?

1821
01:20:54.288 --> 01:20:55.823
I'm sorry. I didn't know
the police were here.

1822
01:20:55.856 --> 01:20:57.625
This is my colleague,
detective.

1823
01:20:57.658 --> 01:20:58.893
The one I fucking
told you about.

1824
01:20:58.927 --> 01:21:00.228
No, you didn't.

1825
01:21:00.261 --> 01:21:01.930
Yes, I did, Helen Keller!

1826
01:21:01.963 --> 01:21:03.164
You're both named Amber?

1827
01:21:04.232 --> 01:21:06.534
What did I tell you
about talking to me?

1828
01:21:06.567 --> 01:21:08.702
Nothing. You just said
nothing about talking.

1829
01:21:08.736 --> 01:21:10.271
You want me to have Cagney

1830
01:21:10.304 --> 01:21:12.073
and fucking Lacey
explain it to you?

1831
01:21:12.106 --> 01:21:13.774
Cagney's coming down
your fucking throat.

1832
01:21:13.807 --> 01:21:15.143
Lacey, she's gonna
come up your ass.

1833
01:21:15.176 --> 01:21:16.978
I'm gonna meet them
in the fucking middle...

1834
01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:18.712
and play your heart
like a fucking accordion.

1835
01:21:18.746 --> 01:21:20.748
I'm gonna pump
that shit until it pops.

1836
01:21:20.781 --> 01:21:21.916
You Swedish bitch.

1837
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:23.517
You wouldn't dare.

1838
01:21:23.551 --> 01:21:25.753
You gonna cry, you little
Swiss fucking pussy?

1839
01:21:25.786 --> 01:21:27.155
I'm not gonna cry.
You're crying now!

1840
01:21:27.188 --> 01:21:28.389
I'm not!

1841
01:21:28.422 --> 01:21:31.225
It's so fucking hot!

1842
01:21:31.259 --> 01:21:33.461
You know, just, let's leave
Anton alone for now.

1843
01:21:33.494 --> 01:21:34.562
Please.

1844
01:21:34.595 --> 01:21:35.595
What's your name?

1845
01:21:36.230 --> 01:21:37.365
Susan Cooper.
What?

1846
01:21:38.366 --> 01:21:41.302
Sorry, it came out.
What did I...

1847
01:21:41.335 --> 01:21:42.836
She's not supposed to
fucking say her real name.

1848
01:21:42.870 --> 01:21:44.638
She's one of my best. She's
highly fucking skilled.

1849
01:21:44.672 --> 01:21:45.940
Very skilled.

1850
01:21:45.974 --> 01:21:48.142
At what? Getting things
out of a high cupboard?

1851
01:21:48.176 --> 01:21:50.078
Don't do that.

1852
01:21:50.111 --> 01:21:52.613
That's very good!
Because I'm tall.

1853
01:21:52.646 --> 01:21:54.949
Weirdly, I'm not very good
at reaching high things.

1854
01:21:54.983 --> 01:21:57.543
A doctor once said to me I have
the muscle capacity of an infant.

1855
01:21:57.618 --> 01:21:58.778
My arms are like two noodles.

1856
01:22:09.063 --> 01:22:10.364
Susan, get Rayna
to safety, now!

1857
01:22:10.931 --> 01:22:12.133
I've got her.

1858
01:22:12.166 --> 01:22:13.166
Go!

1859
01:22:17.538 --> 01:22:18.538
Get away!

1860
01:22:24.512 --> 01:22:25.846
Oh, my God!

1861
01:22:25.879 --> 01:22:28.216
Who puts a roof on a scooter?
What are you, the Pope?

1862
01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:40.360
Ooh!

1863
01:22:42.030 --> 01:22:43.190
Get out of the way!

1864
01:22:44.932 --> 01:22:46.034
Oh!

1865
01:22:50.504 --> 01:22:51.572
Oh, my God!

1866
01:22:59.547 --> 01:23:01.587
This guy is driving crazy!
I can't keep up with him!

1867
01:23:04.085 --> 01:23:05.119
Wait a minute.

1868
01:23:07.121 --> 01:23:08.156
I got it.

1869
01:23:09.357 --> 01:23:11.192
All right, little detour.

1870
01:23:18.566 --> 01:23:19.667
Oh, God.

1871
01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:20.700
Let's do this!

1872
01:23:27.975 --> 01:23:30.478
I am so badass!

1873
01:23:34.548 --> 01:23:35.683
I got it.

1874
01:23:35.716 --> 01:23:36.756
I know what you're saying.

1875
01:23:37.651 --> 01:23:39.087
You're no prize yourself!

1876
01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.120
Get back to work!

1877
01:23:43.524 --> 01:23:44.792
Where are we going?

1878
01:23:44.825 --> 01:23:46.660
Smells like cheese
under here!

1879
01:23:46.694 --> 01:23:49.130
Apologies.
I may be sweating...

1880
01:23:49.163 --> 01:23:52.866
cheese because I had
quite a hearty lasagna.

1881
01:23:52.900 --> 01:23:55.035
Fucking ridiculous
clown show!

1882
01:23:55.069 --> 01:23:56.604
This fuckery stops now.

1883
01:24:17.925 --> 01:24:19.227
Excuse me, do you know

1884
01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.428
if there's a Popeyes Chicken
around here?

1885
01:24:20.461 --> 01:24:21.729
What?

1886
01:24:21.762 --> 01:24:23.962
I saw a KFC down the way,
but I'm more of a Popeyes guy.

1887
01:24:25.699 --> 01:24:26.867
The food
is really weird...

1888
01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:28.220
Oh, my God,
I'll ask someone else!

1889
01:24:44.485 --> 01:24:45.686
Okay, enough!

1890
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:58.030
Drop your weapon!

1891
01:24:59.900 --> 01:25:01.269
Oh, my God. Karen.

1892
01:25:01.302 --> 01:25:02.970
Why aren't you in Capri?

1893
01:25:03.003 --> 01:25:05.473
I'm so sorry I shot you.

1894
01:25:05.506 --> 01:25:06.874
You must not have known
it was me, either.

1895
01:25:06.907 --> 01:25:07.907
I changed my hair.

1896
01:25:08.609 --> 01:25:10.010
Oh, yeah.

1897
01:25:10.043 --> 01:25:11.712
Looks really good.
Are those extensions?

1898
01:25:12.713 --> 01:25:14.782
No, it's just my hair.

1899
01:25:14.815 --> 01:25:16.049
You know, a few clips.
Colored.

1900
01:25:16.083 --> 01:25:17.985
Okay, if you say so.

1901
01:25:18.018 --> 01:25:19.720
I'm sorry. And I'm sorry
about this, too.

1902
01:25:26.727 --> 01:25:27.728
Oh, my God.

1903
01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:34.002
No, no, no!

1904
01:25:34.035 --> 01:25:36.971
Susan! My thighs
are on fire!

1905
01:25:37.005 --> 01:25:39.174
I don't care!
Where is Rayna?

1906
01:25:39.208 --> 01:25:40.141
I don't know.
She slipped off me.

1907
01:25:40.175 --> 01:25:41.610
I was very sweaty.

1908
01:25:41.643 --> 01:25:43.278
I thought I asked you
to watch her.

1909
01:25:43.312 --> 01:25:45.146
I don't know how she ran so fast,
particularly with that hair.

1910
01:25:45.180 --> 01:25:47.015
It must weigh
20 pounds at least.

1911
01:25:47.048 --> 01:25:49.017
Maybe she's a witch. Do you
think she put a spell on me?

1912
01:25:49.050 --> 01:25:50.219
Karen Walker is dead.

1913
01:25:50.252 --> 01:25:51.853
What?
She's a double agent!

1914
01:25:51.886 --> 01:25:52.887
Somebody shot her
right in front of me.

1915
01:25:52.921 --> 01:25:54.223
I don't know who did it.

1916
01:25:54.256 --> 01:25:55.290
I don't know how deep
this whole thing goes.

1917
01:25:55.324 --> 01:25:56.558
Oh, my God.

1918
01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:01.763
Get your motherfucking
asses up here!

1919
01:26:01.796 --> 01:26:02.796
Now!

1920
01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:06.034
But what if she heard?

1921
01:26:06.067 --> 01:26:07.502
She didn't hear.

1922
01:26:07.536 --> 01:26:09.037
But what if
she did hear?

1923
01:26:09.070 --> 01:26:11.240
We weren't even
talking that loud.

1924
01:26:11.273 --> 01:26:12.707
A woman like that
has super ears.

1925
01:26:12.741 --> 01:26:14.476
Okay, she does not
have super ears...

1926
01:26:14.509 --> 01:26:16.778
and I'm only bringing this up
because you asked me to...

1927
01:26:16.811 --> 01:26:19.781
but you are putting a very
negative spin on this situation.

1928
01:26:19.814 --> 01:26:22.651
Oh, wow. We're going with that
now, are we, Amber Valentine?

1929
01:26:22.684 --> 01:26:25.287
Susan Cooper, really?
Susan Cooper?

1930
01:26:40.335 --> 01:26:41.970
Okay. Here we go.

1931
01:26:44.773 --> 01:26:46.841
Okay. We got this.

1932
01:26:46.875 --> 01:26:48.910
My legs won't
seem to move.

1933
01:26:48.943 --> 01:26:51.246
Okay, Nancy, I realize
that you are scared,

1934
01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.847
but you are in this now...

1935
01:26:52.881 --> 01:26:55.650
and I really, really
need you to hold it together.

1936
01:26:55.684 --> 01:26:56.918
Holding it together.

1937
01:26:56.951 --> 01:27:00.755
I shall now be the most held-together
person you have ever met.

1938
01:27:00.789 --> 01:27:01.823
Okay. Let's go.

1939
01:27:01.856 --> 01:27:02.856
Oh, dear.

1940
01:27:03.792 --> 01:27:06.261
Be prepared for anything.
She's erratic.

1941
01:27:06.295 --> 01:27:08.330
It's impossible to tell
what she's thinking.

1942
01:27:08.363 --> 01:27:10.265
Probably because she's
thinking in Bulgarian.

1943
01:27:14.503 --> 01:27:17.272
What are you doing? I'm
just tying up my shoelaces.

1944
01:27:17.306 --> 01:27:18.973
You're wearing a loafer.
Get over here.

1945
01:27:26.548 --> 01:27:27.682
Get in!

1946
01:27:27.716 --> 01:27:29.984
Shit! People are trying
to kill me

1947
01:27:30.018 --> 01:27:31.620
and all that's left
of my fucking security team

1948
01:27:31.653 --> 01:27:33.054
is you two defending me...

1949
01:27:33.087 --> 01:27:35.287
and you look like somebody's
demented aunts on vacation!

1950
01:27:38.259 --> 01:27:40.094
Do you have anyone
on your team...

1951
01:27:40.128 --> 01:27:42.364
other than this
asthmatic Big Bird?

1952
01:27:42.397 --> 01:27:44.065
Yeah, we usually
just use her

1953
01:27:44.098 --> 01:27:46.635
for non-physical
security resources.

1954
01:27:46.668 --> 01:27:48.837
I'm very non-physically
resourceful.

1955
01:27:48.870 --> 01:27:52.507
I do a lot of reading.
I read palms and maps...

1956
01:27:52.541 --> 01:27:54.142
and I've read all of
The Hunger Games...

1957
01:27:54.175 --> 01:27:56.010
How is that helpful?

1958
01:27:56.044 --> 01:27:57.111
I don't know.
I'm panicking!

1959
01:27:57.145 --> 01:27:58.747
And you!

1960
01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:01.450
You have to stop with these
stupid Penny Morgan outfits!

1961
01:28:01.483 --> 01:28:04.218
You have to dress

1962

Get me more security

She's coming tonight

Yeah.

01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.240
God damn it!

2090
01:33:29.243 --> 01:33:30.544
Nancy, where are you?

2091
01:33:30.578 --> 01:33:32.313
Bit indisposed.

2092
01:33:32.346 --> 01:33:34.315
It turns out 50 Cent
doesn't have a great sense

2093
01:33:34.348 --> 01:33:35.784
of humor or irony.

2094
01:33:35.817 --> 01:33:38.319
I need backup!
I lost my gun in the club!

2095
01:33:53.501 --> 01:33:55.103
We're probably
more alike than you think!

2096
01:33:55.970 --> 01:33:56.970
Oh!

2097
01:34:03.678 --> 01:34:04.713
Okay. Okay.

2098
01:34:06.647 --> 01:34:07.782
Oh, shit.

2099
01:34:08.249 --> 01:34:09.718
Ow!

2100
01:34:10.785 --> 01:34:12.386
Why'd I get
rid of my gloves?

2101
01:34:36.277 --> 01:34:37.812
Ow! Motherbutler!

2102
01:34:49.623 --> 01:34:51.143
You got a lot of rage
in that jumpsuit.

2103
01:35:10.411 --> 01:35:11.411
You dead serious?

2104
01:35:13.147 --> 01:35:14.682
God!

2105
01:35:14.715 --> 01:35:16.150
Wait! Wait a minute!

2106
01:35:17.752 --> 01:35:20.721
This isn't what you want,
or what I want.

2107
01:35:21.622 --> 01:35:23.557
This is like what
the Man wants.

2108
01:35:23.591 --> 01:35:26.727
Us, you know? Two smart,
pretty brunettes...

2109
01:35:26.761 --> 01:35:28.629
kind of breaking
each other down.

2110
01:35:28.662 --> 01:35:31.299
I mean, you look similar to a
gal I was in college with.

2111
01:35:31.332 --> 01:35:32.533
Things happened.

2112
01:35:32.566 --> 01:35:33.935
I think we all dabble.

2113
01:35:33.968 --> 01:35:36.637
It's mostly just kind of
stuff with hands and...

2114
01:35:36.670 --> 01:35:38.072
God, I can't wait
to kill you.

2115
01:36:04.432 --> 01:36:05.432
Oh...

2116
01:36:06.367 --> 01:36:07.368
That's clean through.

2117
01:36:08.837 --> 01:36:09.971
Thanks for your weapon.

2118
01:36:10.004 --> 01:36:11.272
It's been inside you,

2119
01:36:11.305 --> 01:36:12.945
so I don't think
it should go inside me...

2120
01:36:23.818 --> 01:36:25.286
Get up. Get up!

2121
01:36:28.456 --> 01:36:31.059
You are under arrest
by Susan Cooper...

2122
01:36:31.092 --> 01:36:32.652
and the government
of the United States.

2123
01:36:42.703 --> 01:36:44.305
Rayna, how did you do that?

2124
01:36:44.338 --> 01:36:45.338
I didn't.

2125
01:36:45.673 --> 01:36:46.673
He did.

2126
01:36:54.182 --> 01:36:55.182
Hello, Coop.

2127
01:36:58.519 --> 01:36:59.587
Fine?

2128
01:36:59.620 --> 01:37:00.620
Ow...

2129
01:37:01.322 --> 01:37:02.523
Hey.

2130
01:37:03.491 --> 01:37:04.558
Coop.

2131
01:37:17.505 --> 01:37:18.572
Wake up!

2132
01:37:19.573 --> 01:37:21.675
Did you have a nice nap?

2133
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:23.511
You were snoring
very loudly.

2134
01:37:23.544 --> 01:37:24.845
That's just really
not the most

2135
01:37:24.879 --> 01:37:26.780
upsetting news right now.

2136
01:37:26.814 --> 01:37:28.950
My father used to
bring people here.

2137
01:37:28.983 --> 01:37:31.552
Did he also make you dress
like a slutty dolphin trainer?

2138
01:37:31.585 --> 01:37:33.254
He'd starve them...

2139
01:37:33.287 --> 01:37:34.688
torture them.

2140
01:37:34.722 --> 01:37:36.157
You name it.

2141
01:37:36.190 --> 01:37:37.625
But he especially
didn't like it

2142
01:37:37.658 --> 01:37:39.027
when people lied to him.

2143
01:37:40.028 --> 01:37:41.595
Not that I bought it.

2144
01:37:41.629 --> 01:37:42.663
You knew?

2145
01:37:42.696 --> 01:37:44.132
Of course I knew.

2146
01:37:44.165 --> 01:37:46.800
I told you, you were better
off in the basement, Coop.

2147
01:37:46.834 --> 01:37:48.202
You could have
avoided all of this.

2148
01:37:48.236 --> 01:37:49.837
And what, Fine?

2149
01:37:49.870 --> 01:37:51.572
Now you're a nuclear
black marketer?

2150
01:37:51.605 --> 01:37:52.640
A terrorist?

2151
01:37:52.673 --> 01:37:54.342
No...

2152
01:37:55.409 --> 01:37:57.078
He's just fucking me.

2153
01:38:04.752 --> 01:38:05.920
You're a loud kisser.

2154
01:38:06.988 --> 01:38:08.957
Excuse me?
You're a loud kisser.

2155
01:38:08.990 --> 01:38:11.192
And it's gross
and unappealing.

2156
01:38:11.225 --> 01:38:12.726
You look like some
old, toothless woman

2157
01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.062
sucking the jelly
out of a donut.

2158
01:38:15.529 --> 01:38:16.998
Hey, what's it like
sleeping with the man

2159
01:38:17.031 --> 01:38:18.566
that killed your father?

2160
01:38:18.599 --> 01:38:19.599
Nice try, Coop.

2161
01:38:21.202 --> 01:38:22.971
She already knows
it was Cress.

2162
01:38:23.171 --> 01:38:24.305
Ah.

2163
01:38:24.338 --> 01:38:25.773
Okay.

2164
01:38:25.806 --> 01:38:29.143
You've probably always been in
love with him, haven't you?

2165
01:38:29.177 --> 01:38:31.445
Talking in his ear...

2166
01:38:31.479 --> 01:38:34.248
hoping eventually one day
he'll fall in love with you.

2167
01:38:36.084 --> 01:38:38.687
Poor little,
pathetic Susan Coleman.

2168
01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.122
That's not my last name,

2169
01:38:40.155 --> 01:38:41.755
so it's really not much
of a burn, is it?

2170
01:38:41.790 --> 01:38:42.824
Cooping.

2171
01:38:42.857 --> 01:38:43.892
No.

2172
01:38:43.925 --> 01:38:45.160
Croupon.

2173
01:38:45.194 --> 01:38:47.162
Are you thinking "Groupon"?

2174
01:38:47.196 --> 01:38:48.730
No, my name's not "Groupon."

2175
01:38:48.763 --> 01:38:50.532
Croupe.
Keep going.

2176
01:38:50.565 --> 01:38:51.967
Kapowski.

2177
01:38:52.001 --> 01:38:53.535
That's getting
further from it!

2178
01:38:53.568 --> 01:38:56.738
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
let's just call you dead.

2179
01:38:56.771 --> 01:38:58.307
Hey, baby?

2180
01:38:58.340 --> 01:38:59.441
I thought we were gonna hang
on to her till tonight.

2181
01:38:59.474 --> 01:39:01.010
I changed my mind.

2182
01:39:04.313 --> 01:39:05.347
Goodbye.

2183
01:39:10.219 --> 01:39:11.686
Like I'd waste
a bullet on you.

2184
01:39:13.755 --> 01:39:14.990
Put her in the room.

2185
01:39:24.199 --> 01:39:25.199
Ah!

2186
01:39:33.475 --> 01:39:34.475
Hey, Aldo.

2187
01:39:35.644 --> 01:39:37.846
Hello, captured lady.

2188
01:39:37.879 --> 01:39:39.214
I failed.

2189
01:39:40.649 --> 01:39:41.683
I failed the mission.

2190
01:39:42.684 --> 01:39:44.686
Fine is alive...

2191
01:39:44.719 --> 01:39:46.521
and he's a traitor.

2192
01:39:46.555 --> 01:39:48.190
Don't be downhearted.

2193
01:39:50.092 --> 01:39:52.461
My mama said to me...

2194
01:39:52.494 --> 01:39:57.566
"Aldo,
life is full of sorrow...

2195
01:39:57.599 --> 01:39:59.068
"and surprises.

2196
01:40:00.102 --> 01:40:05.740
"But, a magnificent
pair of bosoms...

2197
01:40:06.875 --> 01:40:09.078
"will..."

2198
01:40:11.913 --> 01:40:13.215
Good story.

2199
01:40:25.594 --> 01:40:27.129
Susan.

2200
01:40:27.162 --> 01:40:28.663
Get away from me.
No, listen.

2201
01:40:28.697 --> 01:40:30.099
I haven't got much time.

2202
01:40:30.132 --> 01:40:31.333
Why'd you do it, Fine?

2203
01:40:31.900 --> 01:40:34.303
This was my only way in.

2204
01:40:34.336 --> 01:40:37.406
I had to fake my death
to gain Rayna's trust.

2205
01:40:37.439 --> 01:40:39.674
I jammed the signal,
popped out my lens.

2206
01:40:39.708 --> 01:40:41.543
It was easy.

2207
01:40:41.576 --> 01:40:44.346
I hated to do it to you, Coop,
but I had to. I had to.

2208
01:40:44.379 --> 01:40:46.248
Rayna knew
all about our agents...

2209
01:40:46.281 --> 01:40:48.983
because Karen Walker
sold her the names.

2210
01:40:49.017 --> 01:40:50.285
I just couldn't trust anyone
at the agency

2211
01:40:50.319 --> 01:40:52.421
not to give me away,
not even you.

2212
01:40:52.454 --> 01:40:54.089
How do I even know
you're telling me the truth?

2213
01:40:54.123 --> 01:40:56.091
Did Karen Walker
try to kill you?

2214
01:40:56.125 --> 01:40:57.559
You shot her?

2215
01:40:57.592 --> 01:40:59.661
I'm deep undercover.

2216
01:40:59.694 --> 01:41:01.630
But not so deep that
I can't still protect you.

2217
01:41:03.031 --> 01:41:04.099
All right, look me
in the eye.

2218
01:41:04.133 --> 01:41:05.334
What?

2219
01:41:05.367 --> 01:41:06.801
Really look me
in the eye.

2220
01:41:09.638 --> 01:41:11.706
One of your eyes is bigger
than the other.

2221
01:41:11.740 --> 01:41:12.807
Really?

2222
01:41:13.041 --> 01:41:15.076
No.

2223
01:41:15.110 --> 01:41:16.978
You're perfect,
God damn it.

2224
01:41:17.011 --> 01:41:18.447
Asshole.

2225
01:41:21.116 --> 01:41:22.384
That hurt.

2226
01:41:22.417 --> 01:41:24.619
Good, it was
supposed to.

2227
01:41:24.653 --> 01:41:25.920
Bosom.

2228
01:41:25.954 --> 01:41:27.622
Is he dangerous?

2229
01:41:27.656 --> 01:41:30.024
Only if you have boobs.

2230
01:41:30.058 --> 01:41:32.294
So did Rayna
really know I was a spy?

2231
01:41:32.327 --> 01:41:35.730
No. Not until you blew your
cover back at that kitchen.

2232
01:41:35.764 --> 01:41:38.099
I really thought she was more
experienced than that.

2233
01:41:38.133 --> 01:41:39.734
Thank God she's not, huh?

2234
01:41:39.768 --> 01:41:42.504
Because if she was,
you'd be dead now.

2235
01:41:42.537 --> 01:41:43.977
I think they're pretty
good covers...

2236
01:41:44.005 --> 01:41:45.640
I gotta go.

2237
01:41:45.674 --> 01:41:47.776
We're heading to De Luca's
villa to meet with Dudaev.

2238
01:41:47.809 --> 01:41:50.345
Then we're taking him
to wherever the bomb is.

2239
01:41:50.379 --> 01:41:51.446
This thing is almost over.

2240
01:41:53.482 --> 01:41:54.616
Hang tight.

2241
01:41:59.321 --> 01:42:01.323
Hello, bound lady.

2242
01:42:01.790 --> 01:42:03.192
Not now, Aldo.

2243
01:42:03.225 --> 01:42:06.928
I think Mr. Fine
has underestimated you.

2244
01:42:06.961 --> 01:42:09.030
You found your targets,

2245
01:42:09.063 --> 01:42:10.783
you tracked them down,
you fought very hard.

2246
01:42:11.132 --> 01:42:12.367
Susan...

2247
01:42:14.102 --> 01:42:15.237
you are a good agent.

2248
01:42:18.006 --> 01:42:19.874
You'll get them
next time, huh?

2249
01:42:21.643 --> 01:42:23.345
Unless we die here.

2250
01:42:26.215 --> 01:42:28.450
Then you will not.

2251
01:42:28.483 --> 01:42:30.419
You know what,
I'm not going down like this.

2252
01:42:30.452 --> 01:42:31.986
I need you to untie me.

2253
01:42:32.020 --> 01:42:33.222
Bosom. What?

2254
01:42:33.255 --> 01:42:34.856
Stop! God damn it!

2255
01:42:35.824 --> 01:42:36.824
Just untie me.

2256
01:42:37.659 --> 01:42:39.728
No, you heard Mr. Fine.
He's working a plan.

2257
01:42:39.761 --> 01:42:40.862
We have to stay put.

2258
01:42:40.895 --> 01:42:42.697
Untie me. Now.

2259
01:42:46.201 --> 01:42:47.736
That's my ass.

2260
01:42:47.769 --> 01:42:50.939
It is very difficult to see
or gauge my position.

2261
01:42:50.972 --> 01:42:52.341
You're just simply
grabbing my ass.

2262
01:42:52.374 --> 01:42:54.909
Oh. I am, sorry.

2263
01:42:54.943 --> 01:42:56.978
Let's roll
to our side.

2264
01:42:57.011 --> 01:42:58.079
God!

2265
01:42:58.112 --> 01:42:59.848
Oh! Hey!

2266
01:42:59.881 --> 01:43:02.951
The knot is very tight,
but I am making progress.

2267
01:43:02.984 --> 01:43:04.553
Your hand is way up in there.

2268
01:43:04.586 --> 01:43:08.290
My right hand is restrained
from the weight of my body.

2269
01:43:08.323 --> 01:43:09.691
Okay. Let's try this.

2270
01:43:09.724 --> 01:43:10.892
Oh, God.

2271
01:43:12.427 --> 01:43:16.798
Okay. I will
inchworm my way...

2272
01:43:23.872 --> 01:43:25.274
You're being very loud.

2273
01:43:29.611 --> 01:43:30.611
Shh!

2274
01:43:34.015 --> 01:43:36.751
Wait. I have idea.

2275
01:43:36.785 --> 01:43:37.785
God. Another one?

2276
01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:40.322
Oh, Jesus.
Don't move.

2277
01:43:40.355 --> 01:43:41.823
Wait, wait, wait!
Stay still.

2278
01:43:41.856 --> 01:43:43.091
No, no, no!

2279
01:43:43.124 --> 01:43:44.459
Yes, yes, yes.

2280
01:43:44.493 --> 01:43:45.994
Oh, God!
Yes.

2281
01:43:46.027 --> 01:43:47.729
Can't be happening.

2282
01:43:47.762 --> 01:43:49.898
Damn it, I was having
such an empowering moment

2283
01:43:49.931 --> 01:43:52.000
before this started.

2284
01:43:52.033 --> 01:43:57.272
My penis may be gently kissing
the back of your head.

2285
01:43:57.306 --> 01:43:58.840
Just untie me
before I crush your nuts.

2286
01:43:58.873 --> 01:44:00.342
Oh, please.

2287
01:44:00.375 --> 01:44:02.877
If only we had time
for such pleasures.

2288
01:44:03.678 --> 01:44:05.547
Go!

2289
01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:07.949
Your face and the knot
are about to enter my colon.

2290
01:44:09.884 --> 01:44:11.320
Stop licking it!

2291
01:44:15.424 --> 01:44:16.858
It is done.

2292
01:44:16.891 --> 01:44:18.427
Thank you, Aldo.

2293
01:44:18.460 --> 01:44:20.194
I don't wanna know
why my neck is wet...

2294
01:44:20.228 --> 01:44:22.096
but you did excellent work.
Prego.

2295
01:44:22.130 --> 01:44:24.065
Turn around,
let me untie you,

2296
01:44:24.098 --> 01:44:25.600
and let's get
the fuck out of here.

2297
01:45:11.312 --> 01:45:13.214
I need you to alert
CIA and Interpol.

2298
01:45:13.247 --> 01:45:15.116
I'm gonna go to De Luca's
and back up Fine.

2299
01:45:15.149 --> 01:45:16.229
You know where
the villa is?

2300
01:45:18.553 --> 01:45:20.855
I know everything.

2301
01:45:20.889 --> 01:45:23.324
One day, lady super spy...

2302
01:45:23.358 --> 01:45:24.859
Susan Cooper...

2303
01:45:25.460 --> 01:45:26.761
I will fuck you.

2304
01:46:02.063 --> 01:46:05.333
♪ The danger is
I'm dangerous

2305
01:46:05.366 --> 01:46:08.336

tear you apart

01:46:08.369 --> 01:46:10.772

2307
01:46:10.805 --> 01:46:12.040
Really nice.

2308
01:46:13.542 --> 01:46:15.343

2315
01:47:04.959 --> 01:47:07.161
Welcome to Lake Balaton.

2316
01:47:07.195 --> 01:47:08.597
I found this staircase

2317
01:47:08.630 --> 01:47:11.633
and made them build
a house around it.

2318
01:47:11.666 --> 01:47:14.168
Our dear Mr. Dudaev
will be arriving shortly.

2319
01:47:15.704 --> 01:47:19.674
You are about to become
a very rich woman, Rayna.

2320
01:47:19.708 --> 01:47:21.676
Which means you'll have to be
a little more careful...

2321
01:47:21.710 --> 01:47:24.112
about the company you keep.

2322
01:47:24.145 --> 01:47:27.516
So many people have such
terrible agendas...

2323
01:47:27.549 --> 01:47:29.984
like perhaps
your friend here.

2324
01:47:30.018 --> 01:47:32.787
I can see his obvious
outer appeal.

2325
01:47:33.655 --> 01:47:35.056
You have terrific eyes.

2326
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:37.191
Thanks.

2327
01:47:37.225 --> 01:47:39.127
But he also works
for the CIA, doesn't he?

2328
01:47:40.461 --> 01:47:44.298
An odd choice of companion for
someone in your work, Rayna.

2329
01:47:44.332 --> 01:47:47.368
Doesn't exactly inspire
confidence in those around you.

2330
01:47:47.401 --> 01:47:50.505
Fuck you, Sergio. You would never
talk to my father like that.

2331
01:47:50.539 --> 01:47:51.673
I never had to.

2332
01:47:51.706 --> 01:47:53.542
Mr. De Luca, it's true.

2333
01:47:53.575 --> 01:47:56.010
I worked for the CIA,
but they think I'm dead.

2334
01:47:56.044 --> 01:47:58.780
I'm with Rayna now, and I'm
here to help you both.

2335
01:47:59.681 --> 01:48:02.751
You and Karen Walker
are both double agents.

2336
01:48:03.885 --> 01:48:05.920
What's going on
at the CIA?

2337
01:48:05.954 --> 01:48:07.689
Drones taking all
the cool assignments?

2338
01:48:10.058 --> 01:48:11.498
If we don't get rid
of him right now,

2339
01:48:11.526 --> 01:48:12.761
I'm calling off the deal.

2340
01:48:14.763 --> 01:48:17.131
Don't you fucking dare.

2341
01:48:17.165 --> 01:48:18.633
Yeah, why don't you listen
to that asshole.

2342
01:48:18.667 --> 01:48:20.802
Don't you fucking dare.

2343
01:48:20.835 --> 01:48:23.572
You're a bit
outnumbered here, Miss...

2344
01:48:24.739 --> 01:48:26.040
I'm sorry, what the
fuck is your name?

2345
01:48:26.074 --> 01:48:28.810
Susan Cooper.
I'm with the CIA.

2346
01:48:28.843 --> 01:48:31.613
Jesus. Rayna, did you invite
the entire agency here...

2347
01:48:31.646 --> 01:48:34.348
or are they just having
a company retreat

2348
01:48:34.382 --> 01:48:35.684
at the villa next door?

2349
01:48:35.717 --> 01:48:37.151
God, you're funny, huh?

2350
01:48:37.185 --> 01:48:38.519
It's just me.

2351
01:48:38.553 --> 01:48:39.621
It's gonna be
in your best interest

2352
01:48:39.654 --> 01:48:41.790
to keep Fine and me alive.

2353
01:48:41.823 --> 01:48:44.559
I'm trying, but I'm not quite
following your logic.

2354
01:48:44.593 --> 01:48:46.394
You want me to slow it down
for you? Okay.

2355
01:48:46.427 --> 01:48:48.062
You're about to meet
with Solsa Dudaev...

2356
01:48:48.096 --> 01:48:51.099
a man I've been collecting
intelligence on for years.

2357
01:48:51.132 --> 01:48:52.634
And I'm guessing
that your boys here

2358
01:48:52.667 --> 01:48:53.968
are too busy manscaping...

2359
01:48:54.002 --> 01:48:56.437
to have told you
how he does business.

2360
01:48:56.470 --> 01:48:58.673
Because about half the people
he deals with end up dead.

2361
01:48:58.707 --> 01:48:59.941
I can tell you what
Dudaev's gonna do

2362
01:48:59.974 --> 01:49:02.043
five minutes before he
even thinks about it.

2363
01:49:02.076 --> 01:49:05.313
And I sure as shit know enough to
cover up a Russian flag tattoo...

2364
01:49:05.346 --> 01:49:07.115
since Dudaev's brother was
killed by the Russian military.

2365
01:49:07.148 --> 01:49:08.617
Jesus!

2366
01:49:08.650 --> 01:49:10.885
You own a computer?
You heard of fucking Google?

2367
01:49:10.919 --> 01:49:12.320
I'll tell you another thing.

2368
01:49:12.353 --> 01:49:13.521
You know
your little girlfriend...

2369
01:49:13.554 --> 01:49:15.790
the one from
the Paris bombing?

2370
01:49:15.824 --> 01:49:17.491
She's just using you
to get to Rayna.

2371
01:49:17.525 --> 01:49:19.127
If it hadn't been for me
last night...

2372
01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:20.662
she would've kidnapped her
at the club...

2373
01:49:20.695 --> 01:49:21.630
and then you'd be
standing here

2374
01:49:21.663 --> 01:49:22.831
with your dick
in your hand...

2375
01:49:22.864 --> 01:49:24.232
because you'd never
find that bomb.

2376
01:49:24.265 --> 01:49:26.367
So you need me, De Luca.

2377
01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:28.603
And I'm not gonna help you
unless you keep Fine alive.

2378
01:49:35.043 --> 01:49:36.410
Now, let me
get this straight.

2379
01:49:36.444 --> 01:49:37.979
You work for the CIA...

2380
01:49:38.012 --> 01:49:40.649
yet you're willing to help me
sell a nuclear bomb...

2381
01:49:40.682 --> 01:49:42.183
in order to save
this man's life?

2382
01:49:42.216 --> 01:49:43.484
Why would I believe that?

2383
01:49:43.517 --> 01:49:45.620
Because she's in love
with him.

2384
01:49:47.021 --> 01:49:48.322
Yeah, so what?

2385
01:49:48.356 --> 01:49:50.024
This idiot
doesn't even know it.

2386
01:49:50.058 --> 01:49:52.326
Too dumb to know
I'd do anything for him.

2387
01:49:54.128 --> 01:49:55.930
And fuck the CIA, right?

2388
01:49:55.964 --> 01:49:57.766
What have they ever
done for me?

2389
01:49:57.799 --> 01:50:00.034
Took 10 years of my life,
gave me shitty pay...

2390
01:50:00.068 --> 01:50:02.837
put me in a basement with
a ceiling full of bats...

2391
01:50:02.871 --> 01:50:04.873
that pretty sure gave me pinkeye
or at least an allergy...

2392
01:50:04.906 --> 01:50:06.240
Something got fucked up
in my eye.

2393
01:50:08.042 --> 01:50:09.477
I would've been out
a long time ago

2394
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:10.712
if it hadn't been for Fine.

2395
01:50:12.981 --> 01:50:16.050
So, yeah, I'll do anything
it takes to keep him alive.

2396
01:50:17.686 --> 01:50:19.620
That's pretty pathetic,
right?

2397
01:50:19.654 --> 01:50:22.023
Extremely pathetic.

2398
01:50:22.590 --> 01:50:24.358
God, you're an asshole.

2399
01:50:24.392 --> 01:50:27.028
When this is over, I'm gonna
shave that fucking head.

2400
01:50:27.762 --> 01:50:28.797
All right, Miss Havisham.

2401
01:50:29.864 --> 01:50:31.365
I'll take you up
on your offer.

2402
01:50:31.399 --> 01:50:33.935
But if you try anything,
I mean anything...

2403
01:50:35.203 --> 01:50:36.705
I'll make
your dream come true

2404
01:50:36.738 --> 01:50:38.378
and send you and
your boyfriend to heaven.

2405
01:50:40.341 --> 01:50:41.341
Let's go.

2406
01:50:54.588 --> 01:50:55.790
Mr. Dudaev.

2407
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:57.992
Welcome to Hungary.

2408
01:50:58.026 --> 01:51:00.695
Like Chechnya,
only easier to pronounce.

2409
01:51:01.562 --> 01:51:03.364
Enough with the bullshit.

2410
01:51:04.432 --> 01:51:06.467
Where is the package?

2411
01:51:06.500 --> 01:51:09.704
Once my client
sees the payment...

2412
01:51:09.738 --> 01:51:12.473
she'll take us all to its
very secure hiding spot.

2413
01:51:12.506 --> 01:51:14.675
Wherever that may be.

2414
01:51:23.151 --> 01:51:24.185
I got it, handsome.

2415
01:51:26.154 --> 01:51:27.655
100,000,000 Euros

2416
01:51:27.688 --> 01:51:29.128
doesn't buy
what it used to, does it?

2417
01:51:32.861 --> 01:51:34.062
Nice ice, Solsa.

2418
01:51:36.130 --> 01:51:37.165
Right.

2419
01:51:38.532 --> 01:51:39.834
He's all yours.

2420
01:51:39.868 --> 01:51:42.103
Gentlemen,
if you would follow me.

2421
01:52:09.164 --> 01:52:10.399
Here it is.

2422
01:52:10.432 --> 01:52:11.733
What is this bullshit?

2423
01:52:11.767 --> 01:52:13.668
Bullshit?

2424
01:52:13.702 --> 01:52:15.470
Solsa, I'll have you know...

2425
01:52:15.504 --> 01:52:16.738
It's the nuke.

2426
01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:19.741
Clever girl.

2427
01:52:26.415 --> 01:52:27.415
A lead-lined compartment.

2428
01:52:28.283 --> 01:52:29.551
Correct.

2429
01:52:29.584 --> 01:52:32.354
The lead lining is thick as to
mask any radiation detection.

2430
01:52:32.387 --> 01:52:34.723
My father was extremely
good at his job.

2431
01:52:34.756 --> 01:52:36.558
Unbelievable!

2432
01:52:36.591 --> 01:52:37.831
You could have warned me,
Rayna.

2433
01:52:37.860 --> 01:52:39.028
I've been throwing
my gym clothes

2434
01:52:39.061 --> 01:52:40.301
on top of that thing
for a week.

2435
01:52:56.812 --> 01:52:58.247
It is beautiful.

2436
01:52:59.481 --> 01:53:00.515
Yes, it is.

2437
01:53:05.855 --> 01:53:06.935
What the fuck
are you doing?

2438
01:53:07.789 --> 01:53:08.858
Conducting business.

2439
01:53:14.997 --> 01:53:15.997
Uh-uh.

2440
01:53:17.799 --> 01:53:18.799
Put it in the helicopter.

2441
01:53:19.835 --> 01:53:20.955
And don't forget
my diamonds.

2442
01:53:24.606 --> 01:53:26.108
What the fuck is going on?

2443
01:53:26.141 --> 01:53:27.843
De Luca played you, Rayna.

2444
01:53:27.877 --> 01:53:29.378
And you led him right to it.

2445
01:53:29.411 --> 01:53:31.813
You didn't expect me
to let him have it, did you?

2446
01:53:31.847 --> 01:53:34.316
I mean, it's like giving a
Stradivarius to a hillbilly.

2447
01:53:34.349 --> 01:53:36.018
I have a buyer
who's willing to pay me

2448
01:53:36.051 --> 01:53:38.620
500,000,000 Euros for it.

2449
01:53:38.653 --> 01:53:40.055
And Dudaev would've
never been able

2450
01:53:40.089 --> 01:53:42.557
to get that bomb
onto American soil.

2451
01:53:42.591 --> 01:53:44.526
My buyer will have it in the
middle of New York City...

2452
01:53:44.559 --> 01:53:46.295
and use it next week.

2453
01:53:47.496 --> 01:53:48.998
So, you know,

2454
01:53:49.031 --> 01:53:50.265
if you haven't seen
Phantom yet...

2455
01:53:50.299 --> 01:53:52.434
So, what?

2456
01:53:52.467 --> 01:53:54.347
Does this mean you're gonna
kill me too, Sergio?

2457
01:53:54.736 --> 01:53:56.005
I'm afraid so.

2458
01:53:56.906 --> 01:53:58.340
Sorry, Rayna.

2459
01:53:58.373 --> 01:53:59.708
It's just cleaner that way.
You understand.

2460
01:53:59.741 --> 01:54:00.910
Explain it to me, De Luca!

2461
01:54:08.750 --> 01:54:10.886
God. He means well.

2462
01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.720
This day just keeps getting
better and better.

2463
01:54:14.256 --> 01:54:15.925
Thanks for the
performance, folks.

2464
01:54:15.958 --> 01:54:17.459
But sorry, Rayna,
show's over.

2465
01:54:24.399 --> 01:54:25.399
Go! Go!

2466
01:54:44.253 --> 01:54:45.787
Holy shit.

2467
01:54:45.820 --> 01:54:47.189
Where's De Luca?
Susan!

2468
01:54:48.823 --> 01:54:49.824
Get down!

2469
01:54:51.193 --> 01:54:52.261
No!

2470
01:54:52.294 --> 01:54:53.662
Whoa! Ah!

2471
01:54:59.368 --> 01:55:01.136
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

2472
01:55:01.170 --> 01:55:02.671
Rayna!
What?

2473
01:55:02.704 --> 01:55:03.704
Under the car!

2474
01:55:04.839 --> 01:55:05.839
Push it over!

2475
01:55:07.609 --> 01:55:09.178
Seriously?

2476
01:55:09.211 --> 01:55:11.546
God, use those fucking
bird arms and push it!

2477
01:55:20.622 --> 01:55:21.622
Oh!

2478
01:55:22.557 --> 01:55:23.557
What happened?

2479
01:55:24.393 --> 01:55:25.560
Did I get him?

2480
01:55:25.594 --> 01:55:27.562
De Luca's got the bomb
on the helicopter. Get up!

2481
01:55:27.596 --> 01:55:28.930
Oh, fuck me!

2482
01:55:28.964 --> 01:55:30.165
I got this.

2483
01:55:37.539 --> 01:55:38.807
No!

2484
01:55:38.840 --> 01:55:40.542
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!

2485
01:55:40.575 --> 01:55:41.543
Hurry up!

2486
01:55:41.576 --> 01:55:42.576
Come on!

2487
01:55:47.449 --> 01:55:48.550
Kill her!

2488
01:55:49.951 --> 01:55:51.220
I've got this.
I've done this before!

2489
01:55:51.253 --> 01:55:52.253
Ah!

2490
01:55:57.126 --> 01:55:58.446
Cooper, you're gonna
fuck this up!

2491
01:55:58.760 --> 01:55:59.760
Shut up and help!

2492
01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:07.069
Are you kidding me?

2493
01:56:11.873 --> 01:56:13.108
Ford, what the hell
are you doing?

2494
01:56:13.142 --> 01:56:14.509
I'm gonna crawl up you...

2495
01:56:14.543 --> 01:56:15.610
and take out De Luca.

2496
01:56:16.911 --> 01:56:18.180
Get your hands off my boobs!

2497
01:56:18.213 --> 01:56:19.548
I'm saving you!

2498
01:56:19.581 --> 01:56:21.716
Oh, my God.
Those do not belong on those!

2499
01:56:21.750 --> 01:56:22.884
I can't get a good grip.

2500
01:56:22.917 --> 01:56:24.953
Your pants are too slippery!

2501
01:56:24.986 --> 01:56:26.788
You should have worn
coarser pants.

2502
01:56:26.821 --> 01:56:29.291
Well, I'm tired of wearing
my fucking sandpaper pants.

2503
01:56:29.324 --> 01:56:31.460
Clench your ass!
Clench your fucking ass!

2504
01:56:32.661 --> 01:56:33.895
Oh! Get out of there!

2505
01:56:33.928 --> 01:56:35.464
Help me out!

2506
01:56:35.497 --> 01:56:36.898
You motherfucker!

2507
01:56:36.931 --> 01:56:38.300
I'm gonna report you to HR.

2508
01:56:39.868 --> 01:56:41.170
Hang on tight!

2509
01:56:41.203 --> 01:56:43.004
I'm gonna swing like
I'm on a trapeze,

2510
01:56:43.038 --> 01:56:44.606
and leap my way up
to the cockpit...

2511
01:56:48.477 --> 01:56:51.513
I told you you was gonna
fuck this up, Cooper!

2512
01:56:56.051 --> 01:56:57.552
Holy smokes!

2513
01:56:58.153 --> 01:56:59.588
Ooh, that's high!

2514
01:57:06.461 --> 01:57:07.629
God damn it!

2515
01:57:09.131 --> 01:57:11.166
Fucking new suit.

2516
01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:13.034
This shit ends now!

2517
01:57:15.404 --> 01:57:16.538
Freeze!

2518
01:57:16.571 --> 01:57:17.772
Oh, my God!

2519
01:57:17.806 --> 01:57:19.608
I am not in the fucking mood
for your bullshit!

2520
01:57:19.641 --> 01:57:20.761
Yeah? Then you'll love this!

2521
01:57:23.112 --> 01:57:26.548
I am not in the mood
for your bullshit!

2522
01:57:26.581 --> 01:57:27.582
Back up!

2523
01:57:28.117 --> 01:57:29.551
Sorry, spy.

2524
01:57:29.584 --> 01:57:30.585
Playtime's over.

2525
01:57:30.619 --> 01:57:31.753
Yeah, it is.

2526
01:57:31.786 --> 01:57:32.754
Say goodbye to your toys!

2527
01:57:32.787 --> 01:57:33.955
What are you doing?

2528
01:57:33.988 --> 01:57:35.028
Don't you dare!
Oh, my God!

2529
01:57:35.056 --> 01:57:36.125
Don't!

2530
01:57:37.992 --> 01:57:39.428
No!

2531
01:57:39.461 --> 01:57:40.529
Oh, my God!

2532
01:57:54.809 --> 01:57:56.178
Die!

2533
01:57:56.211 --> 01:57:57.246
Ah!

2534
01:58:02.284 --> 01:58:04.353
I just shot a man!

2535
01:58:04.386 --> 01:58:06.821
Is it wrong
it felt so right?

2536
01:58:06.855 --> 01:58:08.290
It's so me!

2537
01:58:10.759 --> 01:58:12.394
Hey! Heroic lady!

2538
01:58:13.128 --> 01:58:14.396
In my country,

2539
01:58:14.429 --> 01:58:17.098
there is a saying
about women like you...

2540
01:58:17.132 --> 01:58:18.900
"Hot as fuck!"

2541
01:58:18.933 --> 01:58:21.203
Oh, God. Not now, Aldo.

2542
01:58:21.236 --> 01:58:22.504
Go, Susan!

2543
01:58:22.771 --> 01:58:24.105
Oh.

2544
01:58:24.139 --> 01:58:25.540
That was not part
of my plan.

2545
01:58:28.843 --> 01:58:31.846
Just like a woman
to wear jewelry into battle.

2546
01:58:31.880 --> 01:58:33.248
Although,
this is the ugliest

2547
01:58:33.282 --> 01:58:34.483
fucking necklace
I've ever seen!

2548
01:58:34.516 --> 01:58:35.650
Yes, it is.

2549
01:58:35.684 --> 01:58:36.684
And it's all yours...

2550
01:58:37.252 --> 01:58:38.587
with an adjustable toggle!

2551
01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.668
Here we go. No problem.

2552
01:58:54.102 --> 01:58:56.137
Come on!

2553
01:58:56.171 --> 01:58:58.072
Okay!
All right, I got it.

2554
01:58:58.106 --> 01:58:59.341
I got it.

2555
01:59:06.415 --> 01:59:08.049
Nice copter!
Where'd you get it?

2556
01:59:08.082 --> 01:59:10.419
It's 50 Cent's!

2557
01:59:10.452 --> 01:59:12.954
I had to deputize him
to let us use it!

2558
01:59:12.987 --> 01:59:15.156
He is so afraid of me!

2559
01:59:15.190 --> 01:59:17.192
I'm a motherfucking spy!

2560
01:59:17.226 --> 01:59:18.760
Let's go shoot
somebody else!

2561
01:59:18.793 --> 01:59:22.231
Simmer down, 50 Cent,
or I'll mount you again.

2562
01:59:22.264 --> 01:59:24.065
This day is just getting
better and better!

2563
01:59:24.098 --> 01:59:25.600
He wants me!

2564
01:59:26.968 --> 01:59:29.103
I think we should land.

2565
01:59:29.137 --> 01:59:31.206
I dropped a nuke
in the water.

2566
01:59:45.019 --> 01:59:47.222
Good job, guys.
Sorry about the lake.

2567
01:59:47.256 --> 01:59:48.357
All right, motherfucker,
don't push.

2568
01:59:48.390 --> 01:59:49.958
You're gonna
get your pictures.

2569
01:59:49.991 --> 01:59:51.326
There's enough 50
to go around.

2570
01:59:51.360 --> 01:59:52.527
You know I just helped
kill a terrorist, right?

2571
01:59:52.561 --> 01:59:53.962
You ever see Kanye
do some shit like that?

2572
01:59:53.995 --> 01:59:55.364
He never, never!

2573
01:59:59.468 --> 02:00:01.403
Isn't this wonderful?

2574
02:00:01.436 --> 02:00:03.872
I was hoping to spend
the rest of my life in jail.

2575
02:00:03.905 --> 02:00:05.740
Give me some quality time
to deal with the fact...

2576
02:00:05.774 --> 02:00:07.894
that I was sleeping with
the man who killed my father.

2577
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:09.644
Anyway. Call my lawyer.

2578
02:00:09.678 --> 02:00:10.979
Get the Goyard tote
from the hotel.

2579
02:00:11.012 --> 02:00:12.247
I need everything on time...

2580
02:00:12.281 --> 02:00:14.048
Do you think
I still work for you?

2581
02:00:14.082 --> 02:00:16.818
Whatever. Fuck you.

2582
02:00:16.851 --> 02:00:19.421
I knew you really liked me.

2583
02:00:20.589 --> 02:00:21.589
Hey!

2584
02:00:23.758 --> 02:00:25.594
Fuck you too.

2585
02:00:30.532 --> 02:00:32.000
Don't touch
my fucking hair!

2586
02:00:34.336 --> 02:00:35.570
What are you looking at?

2587
02:00:40.208 --> 02:00:41.676
Oh, God, Aldo, don't...

2588
02:00:41.710 --> 02:00:44.713
I am too tired
to fend off your groping.

2589
02:00:44.746 --> 02:00:45.947
Please.

2590
02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:48.249
I understand completely.

2591
02:00:48.283 --> 02:00:51.085
Look, my real name
is Albert...

2592
02:00:51.119 --> 02:00:52.421
MI6.

2593
02:00:52.454 --> 02:00:55.290
Look, I'm sorry if
my disguise was a bit much.

2594
02:00:55.324 --> 02:00:57.225
I just like to really
get into character.

2595
02:00:57.258 --> 02:00:59.160
Although I fear
I may have become

2596
02:00:59.193 --> 02:01:01.029
overexcited
at certain points.

2597
02:01:01.062 --> 02:01:02.263
Little bit.

2598
02:01:02.297 --> 02:01:03.732
By way of apology...

2599
02:01:03.765 --> 02:01:06.635
should your work ever
bring you to London...

2600
02:01:06.668 --> 02:01:09.237
I would love
to take you for dinner.

2601
02:01:09.270 --> 02:01:11.906
Okay. Yeah,
I think that would be nice.

2602
02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:13.342
Wonderful.

2603
02:01:17.679 --> 02:01:19.080
God!

2604
02:01:19.113 --> 02:01:21.983
How you
like my English accent, huh?

2605
02:01:22.016 --> 02:01:25.354
I learn it from
the Downton Abbey.

2606
02:01:25.387 --> 02:01:27.027
No, I'm only joking.

2607
02:01:27.288 --> 02:01:28.623
Or am I?

2608
02:01:28.657 --> 02:01:29.758
Oh, my God.

2609
02:01:30.825 --> 02:01:31.825
Coop.

2610
02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:33.127
Great work.

2611
02:01:33.161 --> 02:01:34.829
What a job.

2612
02:01:34.863 --> 02:01:36.565
Super Cooper.
Really amazing.

2613
02:01:36.598 --> 02:01:38.199
- Thanks.
- Yes, it was.

2614
02:01:38.232 --> 02:01:39.300
You really came through.

2615
02:01:39.334 --> 02:01:40.635
Thank you, ma'am.

2616
02:01:40.669 --> 02:01:42.036
I'd like to keep you
out in the field for now.

2617
02:01:42.236 --> 02:01:43.738
Wow.

2618
02:01:43.772 --> 02:01:45.807
We need you to fly
to Prague tomorrow...

2619
02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:48.076
to infiltrate an international
drug-smuggling ring.

2620
02:01:48.109 --> 02:01:49.378
Here's your new identity.

2621
02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:52.980
You in, Cooper?

2622
02:01:54.148 --> 02:01:56.818
Agent Susan Cooper
reporting for duty, ma'am.

2623
02:01:56.851 --> 02:01:59.020
Nobody says or does that, but great.
I won't do that.

2624
02:01:59.053 --> 02:02:00.053
Okay.

2625
02:02:00.389 --> 02:02:01.790
Thank you.

2626
02:02:01.823 --> 02:02:04.125
Francis Mays is an
unemployed telemarketer

2627
02:02:04.158 --> 02:02:05.360
living off her
disability checks.

2628
02:02:05.394 --> 02:02:07.562
Oh, sweet Jesus!

2629
02:02:07.596 --> 02:02:10.164
And who wears reading glasses
in their passport photo?

2630
02:02:10.198 --> 02:02:12.300
She's only kidding.
She got ya!

2631
02:02:14.235 --> 02:02:15.704
Oh, my God!
That was a good one!

2632
02:02:18.239 --> 02:02:20.108
Yeah, actually, I'm not. I
don't have a sense of humor.

2633
02:02:20.141 --> 02:02:21.175
No, you don't.

2634
02:02:21.209 --> 02:02:22.844
We'll talk soon.

2635
02:02:22.877 --> 02:02:25.380
Glad the pinkeye
is under control.

2636
02:02:25.414 --> 02:02:26.815
That was actually
an allergy...

2637
02:02:26.848 --> 02:02:27.949
Okay. Got it.

2638
02:02:28.550 --> 02:02:29.918
So, you're a spy now, Coop.

2639
02:02:29.951 --> 02:02:30.951
Yeah.

2640
02:02:31.453 --> 02:02:32.320
Congratulations.

2641
02:02:32.353 --> 02:02:34.222
Thanks.

2642
02:02:34.255 --> 02:02:35.223
I don't think
I'll ever find anyone

2643
02:02:35.256 --> 02:02:36.456
as good as you
in the basement.

2644
02:02:38.560 --> 02:02:39.894
I think you will.

2645
02:02:39.928 --> 02:02:41.563
There's a lot of good people
down there.

2646
02:02:43.732 --> 02:02:44.966
So, hey...

2647
02:02:44.999 --> 02:02:48.537
I know a great little
restaurant right near here.

2648
02:02:48.570 --> 02:02:52.941
Maybe you and I could go
for a nice, long dinner?

2649
02:02:59.814 --> 02:03:00.982
You know what,

2650
02:03:01.015 --> 02:03:03.452
I'm just kind of feeling
like a girls' night.

2651
02:03:04.318 --> 02:03:05.954
You understand, right?

2652
02:03:05.987 --> 02:03:07.922
Yeah, sure.

2653
02:03:07.956 --> 02:03:09.858
I'll catch you later.
You go have a great time.

2654
02:03:09.891 --> 02:03:10.891
Thank you.

2655
02:03:12.561 --> 02:03:14.429
You're a lot furrier
than I thought you'd be.

2656
02:03:15.063 --> 02:03:16.665
Yeah.
Yeah.

2657
02:03:16.698 --> 02:03:17.999
Smell you later, pal.

2658
02:03:20.802 --> 02:03:22.971
Hey, Coop.

2659
02:03:23.004 --> 02:03:25.974
All those things you said
about me to De Luca...

2660
02:03:27.842 --> 02:03:28.842
Did you mean that?

2661
02:03:30.011 --> 02:03:31.012
God, I admire you.

2662
02:03:34.516 --> 02:03:35.950
Glad you're still
alive, Beverly,

2663
02:03:35.984 --> 02:03:37.385
you silly fucking
girly wanker!

2664
02:03:37.418 --> 02:03:38.520
God!

2665
02:03:39.087 --> 02:03:40.154
Nice work, Cooper.

2666
02:03:41.289 --> 02:03:43.458
Wow. Is that a compliment?

2667
02:03:43.492 --> 02:03:44.993
That's not easy
for you to do.

2668
02:03:45.026 --> 02:03:46.795
Fuck it. Look, you
did a good job.

2669
02:03:46.828 --> 02:03:48.663
Probably just beginner's
luck, though.

2670
02:03:48.697 --> 02:03:51.032
There we go.
Where did you get a suit?

2671
02:03:51.065 --> 02:03:52.767
I fucking made it,
didn't I?

2672
02:03:52.801 --> 02:03:54.135
It's nice.

2673
02:03:54.168 --> 02:03:55.904
You still out
of the CIA?

2674
02:03:55.937 --> 02:03:58.006
Probably not.
They need me.

2675
02:03:58.039 --> 02:04:00.041
I think I need to spend some
time on my own first, though.

2676
02:04:00.074 --> 02:04:01.075
Clear my head.

2677
02:04:02.376 --> 02:04:04.679
I'm gonna take this
down the coast.

2678
02:04:04.713 --> 02:04:07.015
Maybe spend some time in Italy.
Drive it to Greece.

2679
02:04:08.583 --> 02:04:10.952
Sometimes a man
needs to go to sea.

2680
02:04:11.553 --> 02:04:12.821
Sounds good, Ford.

2681
02:04:12.854 --> 02:04:13.888
Good for you.

2682
02:04:14.823 --> 02:04:15.823
Take care.

2683
02:04:16.357 --> 02:04:17.357
Bye.

2684
02:04:20.061 --> 02:04:21.696
Arrivederci.

2685
02:04:24.332 --> 02:04:25.500
Do you think
he knows that's a lake?

2686
02:04:25.534 --> 02:04:27.636
No, I don't.

2687
02:04:32.707 --> 02:04:34.643
Let's go.
Okay.

2688
02:04:34.676 --> 02:04:36.845
You can't let anybody see
how sore I am.

2689
02:04:36.878 --> 02:04:37.979
I got you.
Okay.

2690
02:04:38.012 --> 02:04:39.280
Come here.

2691
02:04:39.313 --> 02:04:41.415
My glutes
are really seizing up.

2692
02:04:41.449 --> 02:04:43.117
If you're sore,
I'll tell you what.

2693
02:04:43.151 --> 02:04:45.053
Take a hot bath and then
we're gonna celebrate.

2694
02:04:45.086 --> 02:04:47.221
I hope you like champagne
and beef jerky.

2695
02:04:47.255 --> 02:04:48.489
Well... Oh. That's a...

2696
02:04:48.523 --> 02:04:49.691
You have to!

2697
02:04:49.724 --> 02:04:51.425
Because I stole
a case of it...

2698
02:04:51.459 --> 02:04:52.661
I don't know
if I like them together.

2699
02:04:52.694 --> 02:04:54.797
...out of 50 Cent's
helicopter!

2700
02:04:55.430 --> 02:04:57.032
Slower, slower.

2701
02:04:57.066 --> 02:04:59.234
Cooper,
is this a fucking lake?

2702
02:05:00.936 --> 02:05:03.138
How the fuck
do I get to Italy?

2703
02:05:11.180 --> 02:05:12.848
Ow.

2704
02:05:12.882 --> 02:05:13.882
Bosoms.

2705
02:05:21.523 --> 02:05:23.258
Ah, stop screaming.
You loved it.

2706
02:05:25.861 --> 02:05:27.262
