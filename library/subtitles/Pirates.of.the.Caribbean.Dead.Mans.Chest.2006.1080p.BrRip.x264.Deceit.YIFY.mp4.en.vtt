00:02:20.007 --> 00:02:21.963
Will!

00:02:22.447 --> 00:02:25.359
-Why is this happening?
-I don't know.

00:02:26.607 --> 00:02:28.677
You look beautiful.

00:02:30.087 --> 00:02:33.238
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

00:02:33.327 --> 00:02:36.478
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:39.923
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:44.045
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:47.563
-Cutler Beckett?
-It's Lord now, actually.

00:02:49.207 --> 00:02:54.281
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

00:02:54.687 --> 00:02:57.201
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

00:02:59.487 --> 00:03:02.923
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:12.118
-This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
-Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

00:03:12.207 --> 00:03:14.516
-Arrest her.
-On what charges?

00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:18.122
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:22.166
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.

00:03:22.247 --> 00:03:24.317
-Is he present?
-What are the charges?

00:03:24.407 --> 00:03:27.956
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

00:03:28.047 --> 00:03:30.356
That wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

00:03:30.447 --> 00:03:33.962
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

00:03:34.047 --> 00:03:37.357
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

00:03:37.447 --> 00:03:40.120
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

00:03:40.207 --> 00:03:43.324
The charge is "conspiring to set free

00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:46.956
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

00:03:47.047 --> 00:03:50.676
and condemned to death,
for which the..."

00:03:50.767 --> 00:03:54.282
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

00:03:56.687 --> 00:03:59.679
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:01.678
Captain.

00:04:02.887 --> 00:04:05.355
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:04:05.567 --> 00:04:08.206
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:10.403
Yes, I thought you might.

00:04:12.127 --> 00:04:17.155
<i>(man)</i> # Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest

00:04:17.247 --> 00:04:21.877

# Drink and the devil

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:31.638
# Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:55.397
Prisoners, come on!

<i>(groaning)</i>

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:05.595

00:05:09.567 --> 00:05:10.682
<i>(screams)</i>

00:06:29.447 --> 00:06:31.403
Sorry, mate.

00:06:33.447 --> 00:06:36.484
Mind if we make a little side trip?

00:06:37.287 --> 00:06:39.517
I didn't think so.

00:06:45.447 --> 00:06:49.201
-Not quite according to plan.
-Complications arose, ensued,

00:06:49.287 --> 00:06:51.243
were overcome.

00:06:52.607 --> 00:06:55.917
-You got what you went in for, then?
-Mm-hm.

00:06:58.167 --> 00:07:01.204
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

00:07:01.287 --> 00:07:04.518
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,

00:07:04.607 --> 00:07:08.646
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

00:07:08.727 --> 00:07:11.161
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

00:07:11.247 --> 00:07:13.841
-And the hurricane.
-<i>(all)</i> Aye.

00:07:13.927 --> 00:07:19.445
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

00:07:20.607 --> 00:07:23.405
-Shiny.
-Aye, shiny.

00:07:24.487 --> 00:07:26.398
Is that how you're all feeling?

00:07:26.487 --> 00:07:31.607
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

00:07:31.687 --> 00:07:33.917
<i>(squawks)</i> Walk the plank.

00:07:34.007 --> 00:07:36.885
-What did the bird say?
-Do not blame the bird.

00:07:36.967 --> 00:07:40.198
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

00:07:48.007 --> 00:07:51.443
-You know that don't do no good.
-<i>(Jack)</i> It does me.

00:07:53.327 --> 00:07:56.524
-It's a key.
-No. Much more better.

00:07:57.647 --> 00:08:00.366
It is a drawing of a key.

00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:08.318
Gentlemen,

00:08:08.407 --> 00:08:10.238
what do keys do?

00:08:11.207 --> 00:08:13.004
Keys...

00:08:13.087 --> 00:08:15.362
unlock things?

00:08:15.447 --> 00:08:19.122
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

00:08:19.207 --> 00:08:22.324
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:23.965
No.

00:08:24.487 --> 00:08:28.241
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

00:08:28.327 --> 00:08:32.036
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

00:08:32.127 --> 00:08:36.405
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

00:08:36.487 --> 00:08:38.717
So we're going after this key.

00:08:39.607 --> 00:08:41.996
You're not making any sense at all.

00:08:42.487 --> 00:08:44.364
Any more questions?

00:08:44.447 --> 00:08:46.881
So... do we have a heading?

00:08:46.967 --> 00:08:49.037
Ha. A heading.

00:08:51.207 --> 00:08:53.277
Set sail in a...

00:08:54.287 --> 00:08:56.164
general...

00:09:00.727 --> 00:09:02.524
that-way direction.

00:09:02.607 --> 00:09:03.722
Captain?

00:09:03.807 --> 00:09:08.358
Come on, snap to and make sail. You
know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi!

00:09:11.727 --> 00:09:13.957
Have you noticed lately

00:09:14.047 --> 00:09:18.484
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

00:09:18.567 --> 00:09:21.240
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

00:09:21.327 --> 00:09:24.205
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

00:09:24.287 --> 00:09:27.996
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

00:09:41.687 --> 00:09:44.076
<i>(man)</i> Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

00:09:44.167 --> 00:09:46.397
Those won't be necessary.

00:09:49.967 --> 00:09:54.597
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

00:09:58.447 --> 00:10:00.403
We wish for you to act as our agent

00:10:00.487 --> 00:10:04.446
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

00:10:04.527 --> 00:10:06.802
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

00:10:06.887 --> 00:10:09.720
<i>(Beckett)</i> We've had dealings in the past.

00:10:10.567 --> 00:10:14.116
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

00:10:14.207 --> 00:10:16.482
What mark did he leave on you?

00:10:18.967 --> 00:10:22.642
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

00:10:22.727 --> 00:10:24.683
I would like you to go to him

00:10:24.767 --> 00:10:29.124
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

00:10:29.207 --> 00:10:31.846
Recover. At the point of a sword?

00:10:32.407 --> 00:10:34.318
Bargain.

00:10:40.327 --> 00:10:42.397
Letters of marque.

00:10:43.607 --> 00:10:46.075
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

00:10:46.167 --> 00:10:50.240
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

00:10:50.927 --> 00:10:55.557
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

00:10:55.647 --> 00:10:57.638
Freedom.

00:10:58.527 --> 00:11:01.758
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

00:11:01.847 --> 00:11:03.644
The world is shrinking,

00:11:03.727 --> 00:11:07.003
the blank edges of the map filled in.

00:11:07.087 --> 00:11:10.796
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

00:11:10.887 --> 00:11:13.560
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

00:11:13.647 --> 00:11:16.366
You and your fianc�e
face the hangman's noose.

00:11:17.047 --> 00:11:21.598
-So you get Jack and the <i>Black Pearl</i>.
-The <i>Black Pearl</i>?

00:11:21.687 --> 00:11:25.726
-The property you want that he possesses.
-A ship? Hardly.

00:11:25.807 --> 00:11:29.720
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

00:11:29.807 --> 00:11:33.243
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:35.841
A compass?

00:11:35.927 --> 00:11:37.997
Ah, you know it.

00:11:39.287 --> 00:11:43.485
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

00:12:07.847 --> 00:12:10.077
Why is the rum always gone?

00:12:15.807 --> 00:12:18.196
Oh.

00:12:18.287 --> 00:12:20.755
That's why.

00:12:20.847 --> 00:12:22.758
<i>(snoring)</i>

00:12:26.527 --> 00:12:28.438
As you were, gents.

00:12:58.367 --> 00:13:00.278
Ah.

00:13:02.167 --> 00:13:03.998
<i>(man)</i> Time's run out, Jack.

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:24.281
Bootstrap.

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:26.437
Bill Turner.

00:13:31.007 --> 00:13:33.282
You look good, Jack.

00:13:39.767 --> 00:13:41.883
Is this a dream?

00:13:41.967 --> 00:13:43.320
No.

00:13:43.407 --> 00:13:46.843
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

00:13:54.407 --> 00:13:56.796
You got the <i>Pearl</i> back, I see.

00:13:57.487 --> 00:14:01.162
I had some help retrieving the <i>Pearl</i>,
by the way.

00:14:02.247 --> 00:14:04.636
Your son.

00:14:04.727 --> 00:14:07.082
William?

00:14:07.807 --> 00:14:10.116
He ended up a pirate after all.

00:14:10.927 --> 00:14:14.715
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

00:14:14.807 --> 00:14:16.877
He sent me.

00:14:18.167 --> 00:14:20.727
Davy Jones.

00:14:20.807 --> 00:14:23.275
Oh.

00:14:23.367 --> 00:14:25.278
So it's you, then.

00:14:26.807 --> 00:14:30.004
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?

00:14:30.087 --> 00:14:31.998
I chose it.

00:14:32.087 --> 00:14:36.877
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

00:14:37.647 --> 00:14:40.081
I stood up for you.

00:14:40.167 --> 00:14:42.965
Everything went wrong after that.

00:14:44.567 --> 00:14:49.197
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

00:14:49.287 --> 00:14:52.085
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

00:14:52.167 --> 00:14:54.601
Unable to move.

00:14:55.527 --> 00:14:57.802
Unable to die, Jack.

00:14:57.887 --> 00:15:03.245
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

00:15:03.807 --> 00:15:05.957
I would trade anything for it.

00:15:07.967 --> 00:15:11.039
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

00:15:11.127 --> 00:15:13.687
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:16.281
He raised the <i>Pearl</i>
from the depths for you.

00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:18.358
13 years, you've been her captain.

00:15:18.447 --> 00:15:20.278
-Technically...
-Jack.

00:15:20.367 --> 00:15:22.676
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

00:15:22.767 --> 00:15:25.406
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

00:15:25.487 --> 00:15:29.639
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

00:15:29.727 --> 00:15:32.036
The <i>Flying Dutchman</i>
already has a captain...

00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:34.357
Then it's the locker for you!

00:15:34.447 --> 00:15:37.519
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

00:15:37.607 --> 00:15:41.759
and drag the <i>Pearl</i> back to the depths
and you along with it.

00:15:42.647 --> 00:15:47.038
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

00:15:47.967 --> 00:15:49.798
I already told you, Jack.

00:15:51.687 --> 00:15:53.917
Your time is up.

00:15:54.767 --> 00:15:56.723
It comes now,

00:15:56.807 --> 00:16:01.927
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

00:16:10.687 --> 00:16:13.804
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

00:16:13.887 --> 00:16:16.082
On deck! Scurry!

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:20.558
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

00:16:20.647 --> 00:16:24.242
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

00:16:24.327 --> 00:16:28.559
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

00:16:28.647 --> 00:16:31.878
-Do we have a heading?
-Argh! Run! Land.

00:16:36.807 --> 00:16:40.356
-Which port?
-I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

00:16:46.487 --> 00:16:49.559
-Jack's hat! Bring her about!
-<i>(Jack)</i> No, no!

00:16:49.647 --> 00:16:51.842
Leave it!

00:16:52.447 --> 00:16:54.802
Run.

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:58.605
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!

00:17:06.807 --> 00:17:08.399
-Jack?
-Shh.

00:17:08.487 --> 00:17:13.720
For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?

00:17:13.807 --> 00:17:15.479
Nothing.

00:17:32.127 --> 00:17:33.037
<i>(laughs)</i>

00:17:33.127 --> 00:17:35.516
<i>(speaks Turkish)</i>

00:17:57.847 --> 00:17:59.758
<i>(creaking)</i>

00:18:25.847 --> 00:18:29.920
-Here, now, you can't be here.
-I think you'll find he can.

00:18:30.007 --> 00:18:31.406
<i>(guard)</i> Mr. Swann!

00:18:31.487 --> 00:18:33.478
Governor Swann, still.

00:18:33.567 --> 00:18:36.684
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

00:18:36.767 --> 00:18:40.237
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

00:18:40.327 --> 00:18:44.320
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

00:18:44.407 --> 00:18:46.841
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

00:18:46.927 --> 00:18:50.442
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

00:18:50.527 --> 00:18:52.961
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

00:18:53.047 --> 00:18:55.242
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

00:18:55.327 --> 00:18:59.081
does not mean
he would do the same for anyone else.

00:18:59.167 --> 00:19:02.443
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

00:19:02.527 --> 00:19:03.801
<i>(whistles)</i>

00:19:03.887 --> 00:19:06.321
I have faith in you.

00:19:06.407 --> 00:19:08.921
Both of you.

00:19:10.367 --> 00:19:12.961
Where will you find him?

00:19:13.047 --> 00:19:17.598
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.

00:19:18.007 --> 00:19:21.283
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

00:19:21.367 --> 00:19:24.564
-Properly?
-Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

00:19:25.607 --> 00:19:29.486
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

00:19:35.687 --> 00:19:40.044
-I'll wait for you.
-Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

00:19:49.127 --> 00:19:51.197
Captain Jack Sparrow?

00:19:52.207 --> 00:19:56.405
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

00:19:56.487 --> 00:20:00.162
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

00:20:00.247 --> 00:20:04.445
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

00:20:04.527 --> 00:20:06.438
Jack Sparrow?

00:20:06.527 --> 00:20:08.518
I haven't seen him in a month.

00:20:08.607 --> 00:20:12.236
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

00:20:13.247 --> 00:20:15.681
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:18.327
but there's an island
just south of the straits

00:20:18.407 --> 00:20:20.637
where I trade spice for...

00:20:20.727 --> 00:20:23.241
mm, delicious long pork.

00:20:24.807 --> 00:20:28.720
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

00:20:28.807 --> 00:20:31.037
A ship with black sails.

00:20:38.207 --> 00:20:40.038
My brother will take you ashore.

00:20:50.407 --> 00:20:53.240
-What's wrong? The beach is there.
-<i>C'est trop dangereux.</i>

00:20:53.327 --> 00:20:56.637
-What?
-<i>C'est trop dangereux, je vous l'avais dit.</i>

00:20:58.047 --> 00:21:00.003
<i>Bon voyage, monsieur.</i>

00:21:23.967 --> 00:21:26.356
Jack!

00:21:26.447 --> 00:21:28.358
Jack Sparrow!

00:21:34.047 --> 00:21:35.958
Marty!

00:21:36.767 --> 00:21:38.439
Cotton!

00:21:39.367 --> 00:21:41.278
Anybody?

00:21:46.367 --> 00:21:48.881
-Ah. A familiar face.
-<i>(squawks)</i>

00:21:48.967 --> 00:21:50.685
Don't eat me.

00:21:50.767 --> 00:21:53.645
-I'm not going to eat you.
-Don't eat me.

00:21:53.727 --> 00:21:56.195
No. Don't eat me. <i>(squawks)</i>

00:22:06.687 --> 00:22:08.598
Gibbs.

00:22:28.047 --> 00:22:29.321
<i>(shouts)</i>

00:22:37.607 --> 00:22:39.563
Come on! Let's go!

00:22:42.487 --> 00:22:44.284
Come on! Who wants it?

00:22:47.007 --> 00:22:49.237
I can do this all day!

00:23:37.847 --> 00:23:39.917
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

00:23:50.967 --> 00:23:52.446
Jack?

00:23:52.527 --> 00:23:54.836
Jack Sparrow!

00:23:54.927 --> 00:23:57.395
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.

00:24:05.807 --> 00:24:07.684
Jack, it's me.

00:24:07.767 --> 00:24:08.995
Will Turner.

00:24:09.087 --> 00:24:11.317
<i>(speaks cannibals' language)</i>

00:24:15.367 --> 00:24:18.882
-Tell them to let me down!
-<i>(cannibals' language)</i>

00:24:19.647 --> 00:24:21.558
...eensy-weensy.

00:24:27.367 --> 00:24:31.076
...eunuchy. Snip, snip.
-<i>(cannibals murmur)</i>

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:33.317
Eunuchy.

00:24:36.047 --> 00:24:38.402
<i>(Will)</i> Jack, the compass.
That's all I need.

00:24:38.487 --> 00:24:41.445
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.

00:24:41.527 --> 00:24:43.757
She faces the gallows!

00:24:48.407 --> 00:24:51.001
<i>(cannibals' language)</i>

00:24:51.087 --> 00:24:52.805
Savvy?

00:24:52.887 --> 00:24:55.003
<i>(cannibals' language)</i>

00:24:58.847 --> 00:25:01.156
Save me.

00:25:01.247 --> 00:25:03.238
Jack, what did you tell them?

00:25:03.327 --> 00:25:05.283
No!

00:25:05.687 --> 00:25:07.882
What about Elizabeth?

00:25:07.967 --> 00:25:09.480
Jack!

00:25:09.567 --> 00:25:14.357
<i>(whistles)</i> That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.

00:25:14.447 --> 00:25:18.645
-We don't bite.
-Go on. We won't bite you.

00:25:21.047 --> 00:25:23.515
Come quickly.

00:25:23.607 --> 00:25:26.758
-Tell me what's happening.
-Our name still has some standing.

00:25:26.847 --> 00:25:30.044
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.

00:25:30.127 --> 00:25:32.197
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

00:25:32.287 --> 00:25:34.243
We cannot count on William Turner.

00:25:34.327 --> 00:25:37.364
-Come!
-He's better than you give him credit for.

00:25:37.447 --> 00:25:40.723
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only -

00:25:40.807 --> 00:25:43.037
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

00:25:43.127 --> 00:25:44.765
Even if Will succeeds,

00:25:44.847 --> 00:25:50.683
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

00:25:50.767 --> 00:25:54.999
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

00:25:55.087 --> 00:25:59.956
-A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
-Then there is nothing left for you here.

00:26:03.847 --> 00:26:05.758
Whoa!

00:26:06.807 --> 00:26:08.877
Wait inside.

00:26:09.927 --> 00:26:11.838
Captain?

00:26:14.247 --> 00:26:16.158
Captain.

00:26:19.567 --> 00:26:20.682
<i>(gasps)</i>

00:26:21.727 --> 00:26:23.957
Evening, Governor.

00:26:24.047 --> 00:26:25.958
Shame, that.

00:26:26.047 --> 00:26:28.083
He was carrying this.

00:26:28.167 --> 00:26:30.761
It's a letter to the king.

00:26:30.847 --> 00:26:33.077
-It's from you.
-No...

00:26:36.327 --> 00:26:38.443
Elizabeth.

00:26:39.127 --> 00:26:41.402
What are you doing?

00:26:44.007 --> 00:26:46.396
-Where is she?
-Who?

00:26:46.487 --> 00:26:48.364
<i>(groans)</i>

00:27:03.407 --> 00:27:07.446
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

00:27:07.527 --> 00:27:09.722
as your father believes.

00:27:10.487 --> 00:27:13.047
Then what is?

00:27:13.127 --> 00:27:16.244
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

00:27:16.327 --> 00:27:21.401
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

00:27:21.487 --> 00:27:24.559
-I'm here to negotiate.
-I'm listening.

00:27:27.007 --> 00:27:29.202
I'm listening intently.

00:27:31.007 --> 00:27:33.316
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

00:27:33.407 --> 00:27:37.958
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

00:27:38.047 --> 00:27:40.641
Or else I would not still be here.

00:27:40.727 --> 00:27:44.606
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

00:27:44.687 --> 00:27:48.236
-It will do you no good.
-Do explain.

00:27:48.327 --> 00:27:52.923
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

00:27:53.007 --> 00:27:54.998
There is something
you need to know.

00:27:55.087 --> 00:27:57.078
Ah, I see.

00:27:57.167 --> 00:28:00.159
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

00:28:00.247 --> 00:28:03.284
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

00:28:03.967 --> 00:28:06.322
But you mustn't worry.

00:28:06.847 --> 00:28:10.078
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

00:28:10.167 --> 00:28:12.556
My desires are not so provincial.

00:28:13.247 --> 00:28:17.365
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

00:28:18.567 --> 00:28:22.446
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

00:28:22.527 --> 00:28:24.722
<i>(cocks gun)</i>

00:28:24.807 --> 00:28:29.483
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

00:28:29.567 --> 00:28:31.637
So I did.

00:28:33.487 --> 00:28:35.717
A marriage interrupted...

00:28:37.927 --> 00:28:40.521
or fate intervenes?

00:28:41.207 --> 00:28:44.358
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

00:28:44.447 --> 00:28:46.881
-These aren't going to Jack.
-Oh, really?

00:28:46.967 --> 00:28:49.606
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then,

00:28:50.447 --> 00:28:53.086
I'll still want that compass.

00:28:53.167 --> 00:28:56.637
Consider that in your calculations.

00:29:15.447 --> 00:29:18.405
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

00:29:18.487 --> 00:29:21.081
And I say it was me being clever.

00:29:22.287 --> 00:29:24.755
Ain't that right, poochie?

00:29:24.847 --> 00:29:28.840
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?

00:29:28.927 --> 00:29:30.997
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

00:29:31.087 --> 00:29:36.161
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

00:29:36.247 --> 00:29:40.684
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

00:29:40.767 --> 00:29:44.396
-You know you can't read.
-It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

00:29:44.487 --> 00:29:49.720
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...

00:29:49.807 --> 00:29:51.445
<i>(barking)</i>

00:29:51.527 --> 00:29:53.165
Look.

00:29:53.247 --> 00:29:55.238
There it is.

00:29:59.727 --> 00:30:01.683
What's got into him?

00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:03.803
Must have seen a catfish.

00:30:03.887 --> 00:30:05.878
<i>(laughs)</i>

00:30:10.687 --> 00:30:12.757
Stupid mongrel!

00:30:15.287 --> 00:30:17.676
<i>(pirates argue)</i>

00:30:19.207 --> 00:30:21.118
Argh!

00:30:27.967 --> 00:30:29.525
Come on!

00:30:29.607 --> 00:30:31.563
<i>(gleeful laughter)</i>

00:30:36.687 --> 00:30:40.760
-It's ours for the taking.
-Tide's coming in. That should help.

00:30:40.847 --> 00:30:43.520
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

00:30:43.607 --> 00:30:45.404
There's the truth of it!

00:30:47.607 --> 00:30:49.245
<i>(drumming)</i>

00:30:52.647 --> 00:30:55.525
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

00:30:55.607 --> 00:30:58.679
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

00:30:58.767 --> 00:31:01.327
Amen to that.

00:31:16.847 --> 00:31:18.803
Thank you.

00:31:34.967 --> 00:31:38.118
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

00:31:38.207 --> 00:31:40.562
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

00:31:40.647 --> 00:31:44.083
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

00:31:44.167 --> 00:31:47.159
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

00:31:47.247 --> 00:31:53.686
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

00:31:53.767 --> 00:31:59.637
and they intend to do him the honor
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

00:31:59.727 --> 00:32:01.638
<i>(yelps)</i>

00:32:03.007 --> 00:32:05.362
They'll roast him and eat him.

00:32:06.367 --> 00:32:08.085
Where's the rest of the crew?

00:32:08.167 --> 00:32:12.558
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

00:32:14.767 --> 00:32:16.883
The feast is about to begin.

00:32:17.447 --> 00:32:19.563
Jack's life will end

00:32:19.647 --> 00:32:21.877
when the drums stop.

00:32:23.527 --> 00:32:26.041
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?

00:32:28.367 --> 00:32:30.927
No, no. Oi! No, no.

00:32:31.007 --> 00:32:33.999
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

00:32:34.087 --> 00:32:36.123
I am Chief. Want big fire.

00:32:36.207 --> 00:32:38.323
Come on.

00:32:39.087 --> 00:32:41.601
Oi. <i>(cannibals' language)</i>
<i>Tout de suite.</i>

00:33:09.767 --> 00:33:11.678
Whoa!

00:33:49.567 --> 00:33:51.478
Oh, bugger.

00:34:00.767 --> 00:34:02.837
A little seasoning, eh?

00:34:16.087 --> 00:34:17.645
Well done.

00:34:55.367 --> 00:34:58.598
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

00:34:59.607 --> 00:35:03.600
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the <i>Black Pearl</i>!

00:35:03.687 --> 00:35:06.326
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

00:35:06.407 --> 00:35:08.637
About six would do.

00:35:12.087 --> 00:35:13.805
Oh, dear.

00:35:17.127 --> 00:35:19.687

-Wait. Stop.
-Eh?

00:35:35.847 --> 00:35:38.077
Stop. Shh.

-Lift the cage! Hurry!
-Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.

00:38:22.447 --> 00:38:24.324
<i>(grunts)</i>

00:38:37.887 --> 00:38:39.479
<i>(screams)</i>

00:38:59.327 --> 00:39:00.646
Run!

00:39:13.807 --> 00:39:16.446
This way, lads!

00:39:38.047 --> 00:39:39.526
Take cover!

00:39:40.647 --> 00:39:42.126
Stop it!

00:39:53.807 --> 00:39:55.877
<i>(boy speaks native language)</i>

00:40:20.327 --> 00:40:21.680
<i>(screams)</i>

00:40:28.527 --> 00:40:30.438
<i>(speaks native language)</i>

00:40:34.927 --> 00:40:36.280
Bugger.

00:40:36.367 --> 00:40:38.403
<i>(screams)</i>

00:40:50.567 --> 00:40:52.398
<i>(groans)</i>

00:41:02.767 --> 00:41:05.327
Haul loose the mooring line!

00:41:05.407 --> 00:41:07.557
The mooring line!

00:41:07.647 --> 00:41:11.162
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

00:41:11.247 --> 00:41:14.444
-Don't bite it!
-<i>(Pintel)</i> Haul loose the mooring line!

00:41:14.927 --> 00:41:16.963
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

00:41:17.047 --> 00:41:20.357
-How'd you get it back last time?
-Excellent! Our work's half done.

00:41:20.447 --> 00:41:22.836
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

00:41:22.927 --> 00:41:25.725
-Make ready to sail, boys!
-What about Jack?

00:41:25.807 --> 00:41:29.038
-I won't leave without him.
-<i>(Jack)</i> Oi!

00:41:36.807 --> 00:41:39.685
-Time to go.
-Cast off those lines!

00:41:44.887 --> 00:41:47.685
Aaargh!

00:41:48.087 --> 00:41:50.965
-Make ready to cast off!
-Oi!

00:41:54.367 --> 00:41:56.642
Good doggy.

00:42:11.407 --> 00:42:17.482
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...

00:42:20.447 --> 00:42:22.563
Captain Jack Sparrow.

00:42:24.007 --> 00:42:25.918
<i>(dog barks)</i>

00:42:47.287 --> 00:42:50.245
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.

00:42:50.327 --> 00:42:54.639
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

00:42:54.727 --> 00:42:56.763
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

00:42:56.847 --> 00:42:59.884
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

00:42:59.967 --> 00:43:02.925
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:10.642
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

00:43:10.727 --> 00:43:13.400
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

00:43:13.487 --> 00:43:15.921
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

00:43:16.007 --> 00:43:20.797
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

00:43:22.007 --> 00:43:24.316
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

00:43:24.407 --> 00:43:26.875
I must trade it for her freedom.

00:43:29.087 --> 00:43:31.647
-Mr. Gibbs.
-Captain.

00:43:31.727 --> 00:43:34.639
We have a need to travel upriver.

00:43:34.727 --> 00:43:38.083
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

00:43:38.167 --> 00:43:41.796
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

00:43:41.887 --> 00:43:45.516
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

00:43:45.607 --> 00:43:49.236
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

00:43:49.327 --> 00:43:51.158
William,

00:43:51.247 --> 00:43:53.203
I shall trade you the compass

00:43:53.287 --> 00:43:55.039
if you will help me

00:43:55.127 --> 00:43:57.197
to find this.

00:44:00.727 --> 00:44:03.116
-You want me to find this?
-No.

00:44:04.207 --> 00:44:06.562
You want you to find this,

00:44:06.647 --> 00:44:10.560
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

00:44:10.647 --> 00:44:17.086
and/or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

00:44:17.167 --> 00:44:19.886
Savvy?

00:44:21.367 --> 00:44:23.801
This is going to save Elizabeth?

00:44:26.007 --> 00:44:28.965
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

00:44:31.087 --> 00:44:32.600
Not much.

00:44:32.687 --> 00:44:35.565
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

00:44:56.767 --> 00:44:58.678
<i>(arguing)</i>

00:45:00.807 --> 00:45:03.367
What's all this?

00:45:03.887 --> 00:45:08.722
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

00:45:08.807 --> 00:45:12.004
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

00:45:12.527 --> 00:45:14.722
Is it, now? And you?

00:45:14.807 --> 00:45:18.766
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

00:45:18.847 --> 00:45:21.236
All the men, they can feel it.

00:45:21.327 --> 00:45:24.922
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

00:45:25.007 --> 00:45:27.202
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

00:45:27.287 --> 00:45:29.755
A virgin too, likely as not.

00:45:29.847 --> 00:45:31.997
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

00:45:32.087 --> 00:45:36.399
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

00:45:36.487 --> 00:45:39.206
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

00:45:39.287 --> 00:45:43.166
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.

00:45:43.247 --> 00:45:45.397
Enough! Enough!

00:45:45.487 --> 00:45:49.605
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

00:45:49.687 --> 00:45:52.759
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

00:45:52.847 --> 00:45:54.917
A young woman, by the look of it.

00:45:55.007 --> 00:45:57.521
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

00:45:57.607 --> 00:46:00.246
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.

00:46:28.927 --> 00:46:31.441
<i>(Will)</i> Why is Jack afraid
of the open ocean?

00:46:31.527 --> 00:46:33.802
Well, if you believe such things,

00:46:34.287 --> 00:46:36.960
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones -

00:46:37.047 --> 00:46:41.438
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

00:46:41.527 --> 00:46:44.997
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

00:46:46.567 --> 00:46:48.637
The kraken.

00:46:50.807 --> 00:46:54.561
They say the stench of its breath is like...
<i>(shudders)</i>

00:46:54.647 --> 00:46:58.003
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

00:46:58.087 --> 00:47:03.798
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

00:47:05.607 --> 00:47:07.996
If you believe such things.

00:47:08.487 --> 00:47:10.796
And the key will spare him that?

00:47:10.887 --> 00:47:14.243
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

00:47:14.327 --> 00:47:16.716
Bad enough even to go visit...

00:47:17.607 --> 00:47:19.677
her.

00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:21.564
Her?

00:47:21.647 --> 00:47:23.558
Aye.

00:47:57.127 --> 00:48:00.676
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

00:48:00.767 --> 00:48:04.555
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

00:48:04.647 --> 00:48:06.877
Were. Have been.

00:48:08.007 --> 00:48:08.996
Before.

00:48:09.087 --> 00:48:11.920
-I'll watch your back.
-It's me front I'm worried about.

00:48:12.007 --> 00:48:14.396
-Mind the boat.
-Mind the boat.

00:48:15.207 --> 00:48:17.675
-Mind the boat.
-Mind the boat.

00:48:17.767 --> 00:48:19.758
-Mind the boat.
-<i>(squawks)</i>

00:48:19.847 --> 00:48:21.917
Mind the boat.

00:48:33.204 --> 00:48:36.355
Jack Sparrow.

00:48:36.444 --> 00:48:38.480
Tia Dalma.

00:48:39.244 --> 00:48:43.635
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

00:48:48.124 --> 00:48:50.001
You...

00:48:52.324 --> 00:48:54.838
You have a touch of...

00:48:54.924 --> 00:48:58.155
destiny about you,

00:48:58.244 --> 00:49:00.041
William Turner.

00:49:01.724 --> 00:49:03.794
You know me?

00:49:03.884 --> 00:49:06.398
You want to know me.

00:49:06.484 --> 00:49:10.921
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

00:49:11.004 --> 00:49:14.519
-I thought I knew you.
-Not so well as I had hoped.

00:49:14.604 --> 00:49:16.674
-Come.
-Come.

00:49:20.244 --> 00:49:24.556
What service may I do you?

00:49:25.244 --> 00:49:29.032
-You know I demand payment.
-I brought payment. <i>(whistles)</i>

00:49:32.484 --> 00:49:34.395
Look.

00:49:35.524 --> 00:49:37.833
An undead monkey.

00:49:37.924 --> 00:49:39.994
Top that.

00:49:43.764 --> 00:49:47.518
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

00:49:47.964 --> 00:49:50.353
The payment is fair.

00:49:50.444 --> 00:49:52.355
We're looking for this.

00:49:54.804 --> 00:49:57.523
And what it goes to.

00:49:58.924 --> 00:50:03.395
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

00:50:03.484 --> 00:50:06.760
Maybe. Why?

00:50:06.844 --> 00:50:09.074
I hear you.

00:50:09.164 --> 00:50:13.442
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

00:50:14.044 --> 00:50:16.239
Or do you know,

00:50:16.324 --> 00:50:20.078
but are loath to claim it as your own?

00:50:21.724 --> 00:50:23.680
Your key go to a chest.

00:50:24.244 --> 00:50:28.601
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

00:50:28.684 --> 00:50:31.482
-What is inside?
-Gold?

00:50:31.564 --> 00:50:35.477
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

00:50:35.564 --> 00:50:38.601
Nothing bad, I hope?

00:50:39.324 --> 00:50:42.077
You know of Davy Jones,

00:50:42.164 --> 00:50:43.643
yes?

00:50:43.724 --> 00:50:46.397
A man of the sea.

00:50:46.484 --> 00:50:48.679
A great sailor,

00:50:48.764 --> 00:50:53.554
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

00:50:53.644 --> 00:50:56.522
What vexes all men?

00:50:58.004 --> 00:51:00.393
What indeed?

00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:02.835
-The sea.
-Sums.

00:51:02.924 --> 00:51:05.802
The dichotomy of good and evil.

00:51:06.404 --> 00:51:08.042
A woman.

00:51:08.324 --> 00:51:09.882
A woman.

00:51:09.964 --> 00:51:11.955
He fell in love.

00:51:12.044 --> 00:51:14.877
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

00:51:14.964 --> 00:51:18.752
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

00:51:18.844 --> 00:51:21.119
See, it was a woman

00:51:21.204 --> 00:51:23.843
as changing and harsh

00:51:23.924 --> 00:51:27.200
and untamable as the sea.

00:51:27.284 --> 00:51:29.593
Him never stopped loving her.

00:51:29.684 --> 00:51:34.280
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

00:51:34.364 --> 00:51:36.958
but not enough to cause him to die.

00:51:38.644 --> 00:51:42.922
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

00:51:43.004 --> 00:51:44.881
Him heart.

00:51:44.964 --> 00:51:46.955
Literally or figuratively?

00:51:47.044 --> 00:51:51.401
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

00:51:51.484 --> 00:51:53.395
Could he?

00:51:53.484 --> 00:51:59.320
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

00:51:59.404 --> 00:52:00.996
And so...

00:52:01.084 --> 00:52:03.678
him carve out him heart,

00:52:04.244 --> 00:52:08.760
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

00:52:09.604 --> 00:52:11.595
The key

00:52:11.684 --> 00:52:16.041
he keep with him at all times.

00:52:16.644 --> 00:52:20.193
-You knew this.
-I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

00:52:20.284 --> 00:52:24.323
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>, grab the key,

00:52:24.404 --> 00:52:27.043
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

00:52:27.124 --> 00:52:29.877
Let me see your hand.

00:52:42.884 --> 00:52:45.273
<i>(Gibbs gasps)</i> The black spot!

00:52:46.284 --> 00:52:49.674
-<i>(Ragetti moans)</i> The black spot!
-<i>(Pintel)</i> Black spot!

00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:53.042
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

00:52:53.124 --> 00:52:56.434
<i>(Tia Dalma)</i> I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

00:52:56.524 --> 00:52:59.038
<i>(clattering)</i>

00:52:59.764 --> 00:53:03.120
My little beauty, where are you?

00:53:03.204 --> 00:53:06.594
Such a long time in such a mess.

00:53:08.564 --> 00:53:11.317
Davy Jones cannot make port.

00:53:11.404 --> 00:53:14.601
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

00:53:15.124 --> 00:53:18.241
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

00:53:18.324 --> 00:53:20.758
and so you will carry land with you.

00:53:29.644 --> 00:53:31.555
Dirt.

00:53:32.644 --> 00:53:36.159
-This is a jar of dirt.
-Yes.

00:53:38.404 --> 00:53:41.157
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

00:53:41.244 --> 00:53:44.042
If you don't want it, give it back.

00:53:44.524 --> 00:53:47.561
-No.
-Then it helps.

00:53:49.684 --> 00:53:54.519
It seems we have a need to find
the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>.

00:53:57.524 --> 00:54:01.199
A touch of destiny.

00:54:16.044 --> 00:54:18.478
That's the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>?

00:54:20.324 --> 00:54:22.997
-She doesn't look like much.
-Neither do you.

00:54:23.084 --> 00:54:25.314
Do not underestimate her.

00:54:26.724 --> 00:54:30.956
-Must have run afoul of the reef.
-So, what's your plan, then?

00:54:31.044 --> 00:54:34.354
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

00:54:34.444 --> 00:54:36.719
And if there are crewmen?

00:54:36.804 --> 00:54:38.954
I cut down anyone in my path.

00:54:39.764 --> 00:54:42.562
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

00:54:42.644 --> 00:54:46.603
<i>(Ragetti)</i> Your chariot awaits you, Sire.
<i>(cackles)</i>

Oi!

00:54:49.844 --> 00:54:55.362
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

00:54:55.444 --> 00:54:59.198
-It might save your life.
-<i>(Ragetti)</i> Bon voyage!

-Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
-Sailor!

00:55:49.124 --> 00:55:51.399
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

00:55:51.484 --> 00:55:54.078
There's no use.
You've run aground.

00:55:54.164 --> 00:55:55.483
No.

00:55:55.564 --> 00:55:57.634
Beneath us.

00:55:58.444 --> 00:56:00.753
Foul breath.

Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

00:58:02.244 --> 00:58:05.281
Do you fear death?

00:58:06.644 --> 00:58:11.274
Do you fear that dark abyss?

00:58:13.084 --> 00:58:15.803
All your deeds laid bare.

00:58:16.644 --> 00:58:19.522
All your sins punished.

00:58:21.284 --> 00:58:23.673
I can offer you

00:58:23.764 --> 00:58:26.119
an escape.

00:58:26.204 --> 00:58:29.162
<i>(man)</i> Don't listen to him!

00:58:37.444 --> 00:58:40.322
Do you not fear death?

00:58:42.684 --> 00:58:45.152
I'll take my chances, sir.

00:58:45.244 --> 00:58:47.553
To the depths.

00:58:52.804 --> 00:58:54.760
Cruel blackguard!

00:58:54.844 --> 00:58:56.914
Life is cruel.

00:58:57.804 --> 00:59:00.477
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

00:59:00.964 --> 00:59:04.001
I offer you a choice.

00:59:04.084 --> 00:59:06.678
Join my crew

00:59:06.764 --> 00:59:08.994
and postpone the judgment.

00:59:10.364 --> 00:59:13.720
One hundred years before the mast.

00:59:15.924 --> 00:59:17.801
Will ye serve?

00:59:19.524 --> 00:59:21.435
I-I will serve.

00:59:21.524 --> 00:59:23.833
There.

00:59:23.924 --> 00:59:25.880
<i>(laughter)</i>

00:59:30.444 --> 00:59:33.800
You are neither dead nor dying.

00:59:33.884 --> 00:59:36.398
What is your purpose here?

00:59:39.084 --> 00:59:42.121
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

00:59:43.204 --> 00:59:46.321
<i>What</i> is your purpose here?

00:59:46.404 --> 00:59:49.476
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

00:59:52.324 --> 00:59:54.792
Did he, now?

00:59:54.884 --> 00:59:58.194
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

01:00:07.044 --> 01:00:09.239
<i>(frightened gasps)</i>

01:00:13.004 --> 01:00:13.993
Oh.

01:00:14.404 --> 01:00:17.123
You have a debt to pay.

01:00:17.204 --> 01:00:20.480
You've been captain of the <i>Black Pearl</i>
for 13 years.

01:00:20.564 --> 01:00:22.555
That was our agreement.

01:00:22.644 --> 01:00:26.319
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

01:00:26.404 --> 01:00:30.033
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

01:00:30.124 --> 01:00:33.241
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

01:00:33.324 --> 01:00:35.792
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:00:35.884 --> 01:00:38.034
<i>(laughter)</i>

01:00:38.644 --> 01:00:41.477
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

01:00:41.564 --> 01:00:44.681
-One soul is not equal to another.
-Aha!

01:00:44.764 --> 01:00:51.033
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

01:00:51.124 --> 01:00:53.592
Price?

01:00:55.524 --> 01:00:58.880
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

01:01:02.484 --> 01:01:05.044
One hundred souls.

01:01:05.924 --> 01:01:07.642
Three days.

01:01:08.124 --> 01:01:11.833
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

01:01:11.924 --> 01:01:14.916
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

01:01:15.004 --> 01:01:18.838
That leaves you only 99 more to go.
<i>(laughs)</i>

01:01:20.484 --> 01:01:22.395
Have you not met Will Turner?

01:01:22.484 --> 01:01:25.203
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

01:01:25.284 --> 01:01:27.559
Worth at least four.

01:01:27.644 --> 01:01:29.794
Maybe three and a half.

01:01:30.564 --> 01:01:33.442
And did I happen to mention...

01:01:33.524 --> 01:01:35.879
he's in love?

01:01:36.684 --> 01:01:39.198
With a girl.

01:01:39.284 --> 01:01:41.593
Due to be married.

01:01:41.684 --> 01:01:43.561
Betrothed.

01:01:44.484 --> 01:01:49.000
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

01:01:49.084 --> 01:01:52.918
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.

01:01:53.004 --> 01:01:54.915
Eh?

01:01:57.564 --> 01:02:02.240
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

01:02:02.324 --> 01:02:04.884
But I wonder, Sparrow,

01:02:04.964 --> 01:02:07.114
can you live with this?

01:02:07.804 --> 01:02:11.479
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

01:02:11.564 --> 01:02:16.319
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

01:02:19.404 --> 01:02:21.360
Yep. I'm good with it.

01:02:21.444 --> 01:02:24.481
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.

01:02:25.164 --> 01:02:27.075
<i>(gasps)</i>

01:02:28.604 --> 01:02:31.243

-Three days.
-<i>(whimpers)</i>

-Er, Mr. Gibbs.
-Aye.

01:02:47.804 --> 01:02:50.318
I-I feel sullied and unusual.

01:02:50.404 --> 01:02:55.956
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

01:02:56.044 --> 01:03:00.560
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:01.838
Ah.

01:03:01.924 --> 01:03:03.801
Tortuga.

01:03:04.844 --> 01:03:06.243
Tortuga.

01:03:10.084 --> 01:03:13.554
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

01:03:13.644 --> 01:03:16.761
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

01:03:16.844 --> 01:03:21.042
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

01:03:21.124 --> 01:03:25.402
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

01:03:25.484 --> 01:03:27.998
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

01:03:28.084 --> 01:03:33.317
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

01:03:34.004 --> 01:03:35.835

-That's seaweed.

-Seaweed can be a sign.
-Looks like entrails.

-That would be a bad sign.
-<i>(deep voice)</i> What's that over there?

And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the <i>Black Pearl</i>?

01:04:54.884 --> 01:04:57.034
I've never sailed a day in me life.

01:04:57.124 --> 01:05:00.161
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

01:05:00.244 --> 01:05:03.475
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

01:05:03.564 --> 01:05:06.124
My wife ran off with my dog

01:05:13.044 --> 01:05:15.956
-Perfect. Next!
-I know what I want. I know what I want...

-Me have one arm and a bum leg.

-<i>(Jack)</i> How we going?
-Including those four, that gives us... four.

01:05:40.964 --> 01:05:43.034
And what's your story?

01:05:43.124 --> 01:05:45.513
<i>(Norrington)</i> My story.

01:05:45.604 --> 01:05:50.473
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

01:05:50.564 --> 01:05:54.034
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

01:05:54.124 --> 01:05:56.843
The pursuit cost me my crew,

01:05:56.924 --> 01:05:59.484
my commission,

01:05:59.564 --> 01:06:01.634

-Commodore?
-No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:16.472
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

if not for the hurricane.

01:06:21.644 --> 01:06:22.963
Lord.

01:06:23.044 --> 01:06:24.955
You didn't try to sail through it?

01:06:25.044 --> 01:06:27.478
So, do I make your crew

01:06:27.564 --> 01:06:29.475
or not?

01:06:30.284 --> 01:06:32.923
You haven't said where you're going.

01:06:33.004 --> 01:06:34.995
Somewhere nice?!

01:06:36.004 --> 01:06:38.313
So, am I worthy to serve

01:06:43.444 --> 01:06:46.720
Or should I just kill you now?

01:06:52.604 --> 01:06:54.674
You're hired.

01:06:54.764 --> 01:06:58.598

Yes.

Not until your debt is paid.

01:13:04.844 --> 01:13:07.199

01:13:08.844 --> 01:13:10.914
You must get away.

01:13:11.924 --> 01:13:13.960
Not until I find this.

01:13:15.564 --> 01:13:17.361
The key.

01:13:24.284 --> 01:13:26.593
The dead man's chest.

01:13:27.724 --> 01:13:29.760
What do you know of this?

01:13:29.844 --> 01:13:34.360
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

01:13:34.444 --> 01:13:37.436
No, don't stab the heart.

01:13:37.524 --> 01:13:42.359
The <i>Dutchman</i> needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

01:13:42.444 --> 01:13:46.562
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

01:13:46.964 --> 01:13:49.432
So the captain has the key?

01:13:50.604 --> 01:13:53.277
-Where is the key?
-Hidden.

01:13:53.644 --> 01:13:56.317
-Where is the chest?
-Hidden.

01:13:59.364 --> 01:14:01.116
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Captain Sparrow!

01:14:01.204 --> 01:14:03.559
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

01:14:03.644 --> 01:14:06.204
I'm here to find the man I love.

01:14:07.164 --> 01:14:11.521
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

01:14:12.604 --> 01:14:16.563
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

01:14:16.644 --> 01:14:17.963
Elizabeth.

01:14:18.044 --> 01:14:20.353
Hide the rum.

01:14:20.444 --> 01:14:23.197
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

01:14:23.284 --> 01:14:26.242
-I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
-Jack.

01:14:28.364 --> 01:14:31.481
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

01:14:31.564 --> 01:14:34.954
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but...

01:14:35.044 --> 01:14:41.677
through unfortunate circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

01:14:41.764 --> 01:14:46.280
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

01:14:47.284 --> 01:14:49.115
Davy Jones?

01:14:49.204 --> 01:14:50.432
<i>(splutters)</i>

01:14:50.524 --> 01:14:52.799
Oh, please.

01:14:53.844 --> 01:14:56.199
The captain of the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>?

01:14:56.284 --> 01:14:59.515
-You look awful. What are you doing here?
-You hired me.

01:14:59.604 --> 01:15:01.754
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

01:15:01.844 --> 01:15:04.597
-You smell funny.
-Jack!

01:15:05.004 --> 01:15:07.677
All I want is to find Will.

01:15:10.924 --> 01:15:15.202
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?

01:15:16.084 --> 01:15:18.359
Of course.

01:15:18.444 --> 01:15:22.517
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

01:15:23.124 --> 01:15:26.833
-And you'd have a way of doing that?
-Well...

01:15:26.924 --> 01:15:30.041
-there is a chest.
-Oh, dear.

01:15:30.124 --> 01:15:32.354
A chest of unknown size and origin.

01:15:32.444 --> 01:15:37.154
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

01:15:38.524 --> 01:15:40.276
And whoever possesses that chest

01:15:40.364 --> 01:15:44.152
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

01:15:44.244 --> 01:15:48.954
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:52.480
You don't actually believe him, do you?

01:15:57.044 --> 01:15:59.274
How would we find it?

01:16:01.364 --> 01:16:03.116
With this.

01:16:03.204 --> 01:16:06.002
My compass... is unique.

01:16:06.524 --> 01:16:09.596
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken".

01:16:10.564 --> 01:16:14.796
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

01:16:14.884 --> 01:16:16.875
<i>(Norrington vomits)</i>

01:16:16.964 --> 01:16:19.637
Where does it point?

01:16:19.724 --> 01:16:24.320
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

01:16:26.884 --> 01:16:28.795
Oh, Jack.

01:16:30.724 --> 01:16:34.319
-Are you telling the truth?
-Every word, love.

01:16:34.404 --> 01:16:36.759
And what you want most in this world

01:16:37.604 --> 01:16:42.314
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

01:16:42.404 --> 01:16:47.159
-To save Will.
-By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

01:17:01.613 --> 01:17:03.843
-Mr. Gibbs!
-Cap'n.

01:17:03.933 --> 01:17:06.083
-We have our heading.
-Finally!

01:17:06.173 --> 01:17:10.564
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

01:17:10.653 --> 01:17:13.804
-Miss Swann.
-<i>(Gibb shouts orders to crew)</i>

01:17:14.733 --> 01:17:18.009
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

01:17:24.373 --> 01:17:29.049
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it.

01:17:29.133 --> 01:17:31.727
I assure you, these are not necessary.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:36.091
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

01:17:36.173 --> 01:17:39.529
-You have news of her?
-Most recently seen on Tortuga,

01:17:39.613 --> 01:17:43.401
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:46.291
and other fugitives from justice.

01:17:46.373 --> 01:17:48.125
"Justice"? Hardly.

01:17:48.213 --> 01:17:53.765
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:58.804
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

01:17:58.893 --> 01:18:02.681
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

01:18:02.773 --> 01:18:08.530
I find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.

01:18:11.693 --> 01:18:13.445
What do you want from me?

01:18:13.533 --> 01:18:16.570
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

01:18:16.653 --> 01:18:20.089
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

01:18:21.093 --> 01:18:23.527
To you, you mean.

01:18:27.013 --> 01:18:29.652
Shall I remove these shackles?

01:18:32.733 --> 01:18:36.009
Do what you can for my daughter.

01:18:42.013 --> 01:18:46.768
<i>(Beckett)</i> So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

01:18:46.853 --> 01:18:50.562
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

01:18:56.013 --> 01:18:59.005
I wager... ten years.

01:18:59.853 --> 01:19:02.083
I'll match ten years.

01:19:03.053 --> 01:19:04.691
Agreed.

01:19:07.573 --> 01:19:10.212
Wondering how it's played?

01:19:10.293 --> 01:19:12.090
-I understand.
-Liar!

01:19:12.173 --> 01:19:17.531
<i>(Will)</i> It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.

01:19:17.893 --> 01:19:20.805
-What are they wagering?
-Oh, the only thing we have.

01:19:20.893 --> 01:19:23.168
Years of service.

01:19:25.213 --> 01:19:29.252
-So any crew member can be challenged?
-Aye. Anyone.

01:19:32.013 --> 01:19:34.652
I challenge Davy Jones.

01:19:36.653 --> 01:19:38.769
<i>(heavy footsteps)</i>

01:19:53.493 --> 01:19:56.326
I accept, mate.

01:20:07.413 --> 01:20:12.726
-The stakes?
-My soul. An eternity of servitude.

01:20:12.813 --> 01:20:14.929
No!

01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:18.492
Against?

01:20:19.893 --> 01:20:21.804
I want this.

01:20:33.453 --> 01:20:38.163
-How do you know of the key?
-That's not part of the game, is it?

01:20:41.213 --> 01:20:43.727
You can still walk away.

01:21:07.413 --> 01:21:10.371
-What's this?
-I'm in. Matching his wager.

01:21:10.453 --> 01:21:13.251
No! Don't do this.

01:21:15.093 --> 01:21:17.766
The die is cast.

01:21:17.853 --> 01:21:20.811
I bid three twos.

01:21:20.893 --> 01:21:22.963
It's your bid, Captain.

01:21:29.013 --> 01:21:31.891
Four fours.

01:21:40.613 --> 01:21:43.605
Four fives.

01:21:43.693 --> 01:21:45.331
Six threes.

01:21:54.613 --> 01:21:57.650
Seven fives.

01:22:20.573 --> 01:22:22.768
Eight fives.

01:22:27.293 --> 01:22:30.649
Welcome to the crew, lad.

01:22:32.733 --> 01:22:35.611
Twelve fives.

01:22:35.853 --> 01:22:37.445
Twelve fives.

01:22:37.533 --> 01:22:40.252
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

01:22:41.533 --> 01:22:44.969
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

01:22:48.293 --> 01:22:52.969
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

01:22:54.813 --> 01:22:58.852
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore...

01:23:00.093 --> 01:23:03.085
the very next time we make port!

01:23:10.373 --> 01:23:13.763
Fool. Why did you do that?

01:23:15.253 --> 01:23:17.369
I couldn't let you lose.

01:23:17.453 --> 01:23:20.092
It was never about winning or losing.

01:23:22.373 --> 01:23:23.772
The key.

01:23:25.373 --> 01:23:28.126
You just wanted to know where it was.

01:23:29.653 --> 01:23:31.564
<i>(snores)</i>

01:23:46.933 --> 01:23:49.447
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

01:23:53.293 --> 01:23:55.284
Captain's orders.

01:24:16.333 --> 01:24:18.244
<i>(snores)</i>

01:24:28.493 --> 01:24:30.051
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:24:48.213 --> 01:24:49.362
<i>(plays note)</i>

01:24:53.093 --> 01:24:55.323
<i>(plays lullaby)</i>

01:25:40.613 --> 01:25:43.081
Here. Take this, too.

01:25:44.013 --> 01:25:47.244
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

01:25:47.693 --> 01:25:50.810
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

01:25:50.893 --> 01:25:53.805
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

01:25:58.373 --> 01:26:01.922
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

01:26:02.013 --> 01:26:07.963
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

01:26:08.853 --> 01:26:13.005
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

01:26:14.653 --> 01:26:17.213
You owe me nothing, Will.

01:26:17.293 --> 01:26:19.409
Now go.

01:26:20.493 --> 01:26:23.053
-They'll know you helped me.
-<i>(laughs)</i>

01:26:24.373 --> 01:26:26.284
What more can they do to me?

01:26:31.893 --> 01:26:34.043
I take this with a promise.

01:26:34.133 --> 01:26:36.442
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

01:26:36.533 --> 01:26:40.242
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

01:26:41.693 --> 01:26:43.923
I will not abandon you.

01:26:46.453 --> 01:26:48.921
I promise.

01:27:02.493 --> 01:27:04.529
-<i>(Gibbs)</i> Beckett?
-<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Yes, they're signed.

01:27:04.613 --> 01:27:07.047
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

01:27:07.133 --> 01:27:08.486
Bleurgh!

01:27:08.573 --> 01:27:12.168
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

01:27:12.533 --> 01:27:16.162
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

01:27:16.253 --> 01:27:18.687
Of course.

01:27:18.773 --> 01:27:22.368
-He wants the chest.
-Yes, he did say something about a chest.

01:27:22.453 --> 01:27:25.923
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

01:27:26.013 --> 01:27:29.608
-A truly discomfiting notion, love.
-And bad.

01:27:29.693 --> 01:27:33.208
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

01:27:33.293 --> 01:27:36.410
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

01:27:36.493 --> 01:27:38.529
Brace the foreyard!

01:27:38.613 --> 01:27:41.685
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

01:27:41.773 --> 01:27:43.604
-Persuasion.
-Friendly?

01:27:43.693 --> 01:27:45.251
Decidedly not.

01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:50.691
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one
with the prize -full pardon.

01:27:50.773 --> 01:27:53.003
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

01:27:53.093 --> 01:27:55.687
and the East India Trading Company."

01:27:55.773 --> 01:27:57.968
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

01:27:58.053 --> 01:28:00.442
-Jack, the letters, give them back.
-No.

01:28:00.533 --> 01:28:02.763
Persuade me.

01:28:02.853 --> 01:28:06.482
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

01:28:08.773 --> 01:28:12.322
As I said, persuade me.

01:28:26.013 --> 01:28:28.368
It's a curious thing.

01:28:29.413 --> 01:28:34.851
There was a time I would have wanted you
to look like that while thinking about me.

01:28:34.933 --> 01:28:37.003
-I don't know what you mean.
-I think you do.

01:28:37.093 --> 01:28:40.005
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:46.688
So you never wondered
how your latest fianc�

01:28:46.773 --> 01:28:50.652
ended up on the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>
in the first place?

01:29:14.133 --> 01:29:17.284
<i>(man)</i> Strange to come upon
a longboat so far out in open water.

01:29:17.373 --> 01:29:20.649
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

01:29:20.733 --> 01:29:23.725
And what are we running from?

01:29:28.333 --> 01:29:31.006
That dress. Where did you get it?

01:29:31.093 --> 01:29:32.731
It was found aboard the ship.

01:29:32.813 --> 01:29:37.125
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

01:29:37.213 --> 01:29:40.489
-That's foolish.
-Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

01:29:40.573 --> 01:29:46.330
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

01:29:46.413 --> 01:29:48.324
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

01:29:48.413 --> 01:29:51.405
Off the books, of course.

01:29:51.493 --> 01:29:55.122
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

01:29:55.213 --> 01:29:57.966
-Why do you ask?
-Captain! A ship's been spotted.

01:29:58.053 --> 01:30:00.772
-Colors?
-She isn't flying any.

01:30:00.853 --> 01:30:02.764
-Pirates.
-Or worse.

01:30:13.773 --> 01:30:17.209
You will watch this.

01:30:20.253 --> 01:30:21.971
Aagh!

01:30:24.053 --> 01:30:26.931
Let no joyful voice be heard!

01:30:28.973 --> 01:30:32.010
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:33.765
Aargh!

01:30:34.213 --> 01:30:39.731
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...

01:30:41.133 --> 01:30:43.203
the kraken.

01:30:43.613 --> 01:30:45.205
No!

01:31:01.413 --> 01:31:03.847
I've doomed us all.

01:31:04.293 --> 01:31:07.012
It's the <i>Flying Dutchman</i>!

01:31:07.093 --> 01:31:08.970
<i>(crash)</i>

01:31:11.733 --> 01:31:14.042
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

01:31:14.133 --> 01:31:16.567
Must have hit a reef.

01:31:23.893 --> 01:31:26.805
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

01:31:26.893 --> 01:31:30.249
-Free the rudder!
-Hard to port!

01:31:34.453 --> 01:31:37.126
<i>(man screams)</i>

01:31:37.213 --> 01:31:40.569
-Kraken!
-Kraken!

01:31:53.493 --> 01:31:56.326
Here it is! Take it!

01:31:56.413 --> 01:31:58.324
Take it!

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:00.448
Aargh!

01:32:05.053 --> 01:32:07.009
Agh! Aaaagh!

01:32:27.693 --> 01:32:29.604
<i>(screaming)</i>

01:33:04.013 --> 01:33:05.651
Aagh!

01:33:11.093 --> 01:33:13.004
Aaagh!

01:34:04.853 --> 01:34:09.210
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

01:34:09.293 --> 01:34:11.682
I am the sea.

01:34:15.213 --> 01:34:18.330
You need time alone with your thoughts.

01:34:18.413 --> 01:34:20.847
-Brig!
-What of the survivors?

01:34:26.133 --> 01:34:29.364
There are no survivors.

01:34:29.453 --> 01:34:31.728
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:34:48.733 --> 01:34:52.442
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

01:34:52.533 --> 01:34:55.127
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.

01:34:55.213 --> 01:34:56.965
"First"?

01:34:57.053 --> 01:35:00.125
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

01:35:00.213 --> 01:35:02.090
Who told him of the key?

01:35:05.093 --> 01:35:07.163
Jack Sparrow.

01:35:24.773 --> 01:35:31.292
My intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

01:35:31.373 --> 01:35:34.649
I just thought I'd be married by now.

01:35:34.733 --> 01:35:36.963
I'm so ready to be married.

01:35:44.213 --> 01:35:46.169
You know...

01:35:46.253 --> 01:35:47.652
<i>(clears throat)</i>

01:35:47.733 --> 01:35:52.932
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

01:35:53.013 --> 01:36:01.170
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact
perform a "marr-i-age" right here.

01:36:01.253 --> 01:36:03.528
Right on this deck.

01:36:03.613 --> 01:36:05.490
Right... now.

01:36:08.973 --> 01:36:11.168
No, thank you.

01:36:11.253 --> 01:36:12.732
Why not?

01:36:12.813 --> 01:36:15.725
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

01:36:15.813 --> 01:36:20.682
Oh. Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.

01:36:21.133 --> 01:36:23.442
And personal hygiene.

01:36:24.853 --> 01:36:27.048
Trifles.

01:36:27.133 --> 01:36:29.567
You will come over to my side. I know it.

01:36:29.653 --> 01:36:34.727
-You seem very certain.
-One word, love. Curiosity.

01:36:34.813 --> 01:36:36.371
You long for freedom.

01:36:36.453 --> 01:36:39.411
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

01:36:39.493 --> 01:36:42.451
To act on selfish impulse.

01:36:42.533 --> 01:36:45.172
You want to see what it's like.

01:36:45.253 --> 01:36:49.531
One day, you won't be able to resist.

01:36:50.053 --> 01:36:52.521
Why doesn't your compass work?

01:36:54.093 --> 01:36:57.051
My compass works fine.

01:36:57.453 --> 01:36:59.171
Because you and I <i>are</i> alike,

01:36:59.253 --> 01:37:02.370
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

01:37:02.453 --> 01:37:05.604
-To do the right thing.
-I love those moments.

01:37:06.093 --> 01:37:08.288
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

01:37:08.373 --> 01:37:13.731
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

01:37:13.813 --> 01:37:16.850
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

01:37:16.933 --> 01:37:19.401
That you're a good man.

01:37:19.493 --> 01:37:21.882
All evidence to the contrary.

01:37:21.973 --> 01:37:24.885
Oh, I have faith in you.

01:37:24.973 --> 01:37:27.771
-Want to know why?
-Do tell, dearie.

01:37:29.493 --> 01:37:32.371
Curiosity.

01:37:32.453 --> 01:37:35.286
You're going to want it.

01:37:35.373 --> 01:37:39.082
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

01:37:40.373 --> 01:37:42.443
You won't be able to resist.

01:37:43.773 --> 01:37:48.767
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

01:37:51.213 --> 01:37:54.091
I do want to know what it tastes like.

01:37:54.173 --> 01:37:55.891
But... seeing as you're a good man,

01:37:55.973 --> 01:38:00.205
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honor.

01:38:08.173 --> 01:38:10.209
I'm proud of you, Jack.

01:38:10.293 --> 01:38:13.012
<i>(Gibbs)</i> Land, ho!

01:38:17.973 --> 01:38:19.725
I want my jar of dirt.

01:38:21.133 --> 01:38:23.931
-You're pulling too fast.
-You're pulling too slow.

01:38:24.013 --> 01:38:28.928
-We don't want the kraken to catch us.
-I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

01:38:29.013 --> 01:38:33.245
And I don't think it's "kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "krayken".

01:38:33.333 --> 01:38:34.891
-With a long <i>a</i>?
-Uh-huh.

01:38:34.973 --> 01:38:38.682
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

01:38:38.773 --> 01:38:40.445
and "kracken" is closer to that.

01:38:40.533 --> 01:38:43.843
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

01:38:43.933 --> 01:38:46.527
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

01:38:50.253 --> 01:38:52.403
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

01:38:52.493 --> 01:38:54.723
Don't touch my dirt.

01:39:29.133 --> 01:39:34.127
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

01:39:38.133 --> 01:39:41.330
<i>(Jack)</i> Yes, it does.
You're sitting on it.

01:39:42.173 --> 01:39:43.811
-Beg pardon?
-Move.

01:39:51.213 --> 01:39:53.886
-"Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
-I could join the circus.

01:39:53.973 --> 01:39:55.531
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

01:39:59.773 --> 01:40:04.289
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

01:40:04.373 --> 01:40:06.284
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

01:40:06.373 --> 01:40:09.604
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

01:40:11.133 --> 01:40:14.011
-Down, then!
-Down!

01:40:35.533 --> 01:40:36.886
<i>(shouting)</i>

01:41:18.413 --> 01:41:20.768
<i>(beating)</i>

01:41:20.853 --> 01:41:22.844
It's real.

01:41:23.773 --> 01:41:25.764
You actually were telling the truth.

01:41:25.853 --> 01:41:29.243
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

01:41:29.333 --> 01:41:32.086
With good reason!

01:41:32.173 --> 01:41:34.528
Will!

01:41:34.613 --> 01:41:38.242
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

01:41:44.053 --> 01:41:46.089
<i>(Jack)</i> How did you get here?

01:41:46.173 --> 01:41:49.961
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

01:41:50.053 --> 01:41:51.850
Not so easy, is it?

01:41:51.933 --> 01:41:54.447
-But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
-You do?

01:41:54.533 --> 01:41:58.526
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

01:41:58.613 --> 01:42:00.569
-What?
-<i>(imitates Elizabeth)</i> What?

01:42:01.133 --> 01:42:03.693
...I was reunited with my father.

01:42:03.773 --> 01:42:06.367
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.

01:42:06.853 --> 01:42:10.528
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

01:42:10.613 --> 01:42:12.046
Pretty much.

01:42:12.133 --> 01:42:14.408
Time and tide, love.

01:42:14.493 --> 01:42:16.643
Oi! What are you doing?

01:42:17.693 --> 01:42:19.968
I'm going to kill Jones.

01:42:20.933 --> 01:42:23.128
Can't let you do that, William.

01:42:23.213 --> 01:42:29.004
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

01:42:34.813 --> 01:42:38.010
Now, if you please.

01:42:38.653 --> 01:42:41.087
The key.

01:42:43.173 --> 01:42:45.767
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

01:42:45.853 --> 01:42:49.050
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

01:42:49.133 --> 01:42:52.603
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

01:42:52.693 --> 01:42:56.163
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

01:42:56.973 --> 01:43:00.761
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

01:43:00.853 --> 01:43:03.845
I deliver it, I get my life back.

01:43:04.253 --> 01:43:06.847
Ah. The dark side of ambition.

01:43:07.253 --> 01:43:10.529
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

01:43:10.613 --> 01:43:11.568
Aagh!

01:43:14.653 --> 01:43:16.132
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Stop it!

01:43:16.213 --> 01:43:18.044
Hyah!

01:43:22.573 --> 01:43:24.006
<i>(Elizabeth)</i> Will!

01:43:24.973 --> 01:43:27.965
-Guard the chest!
-No!

01:43:28.053 --> 01:43:32.729
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

01:43:32.813 --> 01:43:38.126
Oh, fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

01:43:38.213 --> 01:43:40.727
That will solve everything! I've had it!

01:43:40.813 --> 01:43:45.568
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

01:43:48.093 --> 01:43:53.042
-How'd this go all screwy?
-Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

01:43:53.133 --> 01:43:56.170
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,

01:43:56.253 --> 01:43:58.642
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

01:43:58.733 --> 01:44:02.726
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

01:44:02.813 --> 01:44:06.283
'twixt him and his
twice-cursed pirate father. <i>(belches)</i>

01:44:06.373 --> 01:44:08.250
-Sad.
-<i>(Elizabeth)</i> This is madness!

01:44:08.333 --> 01:44:11.962
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

01:44:12.053 --> 01:44:13.884
Terrible temptation.

01:44:13.973 --> 01:44:19.730
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

01:44:25.173 --> 01:44:26.925
Enough!

01:44:30.253 --> 01:44:32.926
Oh. Oh!

01:44:33.013 --> 01:44:35.481
The heat!

01:44:53.773 --> 01:44:55.764
Bugger!

01:45:07.413 --> 01:45:09.802
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

01:45:14.733 --> 01:45:16.644
<i>(snarling)</i>

<i>(bell chimes)</i>

01:46:47.733 --> 01:46:50.611
Do excuse me
while I kill the man who ruined my life.

01:46:50.693 --> 01:46:54.572
-Be my guest.
-Let us examine that claim for a moment.

01:46:54.973 --> 01:47:00.206
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

01:47:00.293 --> 01:47:06.323
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

01:47:06.413 --> 01:47:07.812
Eh?

01:47:07.893 --> 01:47:10.361
So whose fault is it, really,

01:47:10.453 --> 01:47:14.651
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

01:47:14.733 --> 01:47:16.644
Enough!

01:47:18.813 --> 01:47:22.442
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

01:47:24.333 --> 01:47:26.164
Still rooting for you, mate.

01:47:32.493 --> 01:47:34.563
Oh! Oof!

01:48:01.653 --> 01:48:03.803

No, that's a tree.

-Not with the chest.

01:54:33.413 --> 01:54:35.165
Pirates!

01:54:40.333 --> 01:54:42.722
<i>(mutters)</i>

01:54:42.813 --> 01:54:44.326
Hey!

01:54:52.493 --> 01:54:55.849
-What happened to the chest?
-Norrington took it to draw them off.

01:54:56.253 --> 01:54:59.370
-You're pulling too hard!
-You ain't pulling hard enough!

01:54:59.773 --> 01:55:02.685
-Where's the commodore?
-Fell behind.

01:55:02.773 --> 01:55:04.843
My prayers be with him.

01:55:04.933 --> 01:55:06.844
Best not wallow in our grief.

01:55:06.933 --> 01:55:11.609
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.

01:55:26.333 --> 01:55:28.563
Lord on high, deliver us.

01:55:31.693 --> 01:55:33.445
I'll handle this, mate.

01:55:35.613 --> 01:55:37.205
Oi, fishface!

01:55:38.613 --> 01:55:41.081
Lose something? Eh? <i>Scungilli</i>!

01:55:46.133 --> 01:55:48.044
Got it!

01:55:49.213 --> 01:55:52.125
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

01:55:52.213 --> 01:55:53.612
Look what I got.

01:55:53.693 --> 01:55:56.651
# I got a jar of dirt,
I got a jar of dirt

01:55:56.733 --> 01:55:58.564
# And guess what's inside it?

01:55:59.453 --> 01:56:00.886
Enough!

01:56:08.653 --> 01:56:11.292
-Hard to starboard.
-Hard to starboard!

01:56:11.373 --> 01:56:14.410
Brace up the foreyard!

01:56:17.413 --> 01:56:19.369
Hard to starboard!

01:56:19.453 --> 01:56:24.163
Send his beloved <i>Pearl</i>
back to the depths.

01:56:35.733 --> 01:56:39.442
She's on us! She's on us!

01:56:40.973 --> 01:56:44.886
-Let them taste the triple guns.
-Aye, Captain.

01:56:56.133 --> 01:56:58.089
Aaargh!

01:57:09.693 --> 01:57:11.172
Make fast!

01:57:12.373 --> 01:57:14.807
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

01:57:14.893 --> 01:57:17.532
Come on, girl!

01:57:23.333 --> 01:57:25.642
-She's falling behind!
-Aye. We've got her!

01:57:25.733 --> 01:57:29.282
-We're the faster?
-Against the wind, the <i>Dutchman</i> beats us.

01:57:29.373 --> 01:57:31.728
-But with the wind...
-We rob her advantage.

01:57:31.813 --> 01:57:33.565
Aye.

01:57:35.533 --> 01:57:37.012
We're out of range!

01:57:37.093 --> 01:57:41.530
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

01:57:41.613 --> 01:57:43.888
We're giving up, sir?

01:57:48.093 --> 01:57:50.004
Agh!

01:57:53.573 --> 01:57:55.768
They're giving up!

01:57:55.853 --> 01:57:57.650
<i>(cheering)</i>

01:58:01.613 --> 01:58:03.649
My father is on that ship.

01:58:03.733 --> 01:58:06.122
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

01:58:06.213 --> 01:58:12.891
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

01:58:13.493 --> 01:58:14.482
Oh!

01:58:16.333 --> 01:58:18.244
<i>(whimpers)</i>

01:58:22.573 --> 01:58:25.246
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

01:58:26.573 --> 01:58:29.406
We must have hit a reef!

01:58:31.413 --> 01:58:35.292
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

01:58:35.373 --> 01:58:38.285
-What is it?
-The kraken.

01:58:38.653 --> 01:58:40.803
-To arms!
-Load guns! Defend the mast!

01:58:40.893 --> 01:58:45.171
It'll attack the starboard. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

01:59:17.373 --> 01:59:19.728
Easy, boys!

01:59:22.973 --> 01:59:23.962
Will?

01:59:24.453 --> 01:59:26.569
Steady! Steady.

01:59:28.453 --> 01:59:31.763
-Will!
-Hold. Hold.

01:59:31.853 --> 01:59:34.731
I think we've held fire long enough.

01:59:35.893 --> 01:59:38.168
-Will!
-Fire!

01:59:42.013 --> 01:59:43.366
Oh!

01:59:53.373 --> 01:59:54.931
<i>(cheering)</i>

01:59:57.453 --> 02:00:00.843
-It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
-There's no boats.

02:00:08.733 --> 02:00:13.124
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

02:00:15.373 --> 02:00:19.651
-Whatever you do, don't miss.
-As soon as you're clear.

02:00:33.253 --> 02:00:37.212
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

02:00:38.173 --> 02:00:40.209
Hurry up!

02:00:40.293 --> 02:00:43.729
-There's only six kegs of powder!
-Then load the rum.

02:00:52.253 --> 02:00:54.972
Aye, the rum too!

02:01:22.013 --> 02:01:23.924
Step to!

02:01:27.453 --> 02:01:29.921
Oh, you coward.

02:01:30.013 --> 02:01:31.571
<i>(thud)</i>

02:01:34.573 --> 02:01:36.529
Not good.

02:01:44.093 --> 02:01:46.687
-Haul away!
-Heave!

02:01:46.773 --> 02:01:50.925
-Heave like you're being paid for it!
-Put your backs into it!

02:01:58.493 --> 02:02:00.768
<i>(screaming)</i>

02:02:06.693 --> 02:02:08.649
Aargh!

02:02:08.733 --> 02:02:10.564
<i>(whimpers)</i>

02:02:32.253 --> 02:02:35.370
-I got you! I got you!
-Don't let me go!

02:02:35.453 --> 02:02:38.013
-I won't let you go!
-Shoot me!

02:02:43.093 --> 02:02:46.005
-Clear?
-Higher! Higher!

02:03:02.173 --> 02:03:04.209
Here! Come on!

02:03:04.853 --> 02:03:07.367
Come and get me. I'm over here!

02:03:07.453 --> 02:03:09.444
Come on!

02:03:33.373 --> 02:03:36.490
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

02:03:41.533 --> 02:03:43.410
<i>(screams)</i>

02:04:36.093 --> 02:04:38.288
<i>(kraken bellows)</i>

02:05:00.213 --> 02:05:02.044
Did we kill it?

02:05:02.133 --> 02:05:05.603
No. We just made it angry.

02:05:05.973 --> 02:05:08.806
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

02:05:10.653 --> 02:05:13.247
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

02:05:15.413 --> 02:05:18.166
Jack. The <i>Pearl</i>.

02:05:19.373 --> 02:05:21.648
She's only a ship, mate.

02:05:21.733 --> 02:05:24.167
He's right.
We have to head for land.

02:05:24.253 --> 02:05:27.211
-It's a lot of open water.
-It's a lot of water.

02:05:27.293 --> 02:05:31.730
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the <i>Pearl</i>.

02:05:33.573 --> 02:05:35.325
Abandon ship.

02:05:35.413 --> 02:05:37.722
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

02:05:53.773 --> 02:05:55.843
Thank you, Jack.

02:05:57.853 --> 02:06:00.492
We're not free yet, love.

02:06:00.573 --> 02:06:02.643
You came back.

02:06:05.093 --> 02:06:07.687
I always knew you were a good man.

02:06:20.133 --> 02:06:22.806
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

02:06:22.893 --> 02:06:25.248
Come on, Will. Step to!

02:06:31.253 --> 02:06:33.164
<i>(chains clink)</i>

02:06:43.573 --> 02:06:45.928
It's after you, not the ship.

02:06:46.013 --> 02:06:48.811
It's not us.

02:06:48.893 --> 02:06:51.566
This is the only way, don't you see?

02:06:54.733 --> 02:06:56.803
I'm not sorry.

02:07:02.133 --> 02:07:04.044
Pirate.

02:07:22.653 --> 02:07:24.769
Where's Jack?

02:07:28.213 --> 02:07:32.001
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

02:07:40.333 --> 02:07:42.085
Go!

02:07:54.333 --> 02:07:57.609
Bugger. Bugger, bugger,
bugger, bugger, bugger!

02:08:24.733 --> 02:08:26.769
Come on!

02:08:30.853 --> 02:08:33.492
Just got it. Come on.

02:08:45.253 --> 02:08:46.766
<i>(roars)</i>

02:09:01.373 --> 02:09:03.728
Not so bad.

02:09:05.053 --> 02:09:06.088
Oh.

02:09:14.573 --> 02:09:16.325
Hello, beastie.

02:10:03.173 --> 02:10:07.212
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

02:10:08.493 --> 02:10:10.643
The captain goes down with his ship.

02:10:10.733 --> 02:10:14.567
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

02:10:19.653 --> 02:10:22.121
Open the chest.

02:10:23.213 --> 02:10:25.647
Open the chest. I need to see it!

02:10:40.613 --> 02:10:46.370
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

02:10:51.933 --> 02:10:54.572
<i>(Mercer)</i> The last of our ships is returned.

02:10:54.653 --> 02:10:56.962
Is there any news on the chest?

02:10:57.053 --> 02:11:02.446
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

02:11:02.533 --> 02:11:04.603
He had these.

02:11:11.293 --> 02:11:14.330
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

02:11:21.573 --> 02:11:25.486
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

02:11:25.573 --> 02:11:28.087
Do you have the compass?

02:11:28.173 --> 02:11:29.925
Better.

02:11:32.693 --> 02:11:34.604
<i>(beating)</i>

02:11:36.813 --> 02:11:39.247
The heart of Davy Jones.

02:12:32.413 --> 02:12:34.768
Against the cold...

02:12:34.853 --> 02:12:37.083
and the sorrow.

02:12:46.933 --> 02:12:49.401
It's a shame.

02:12:49.493 --> 02:12:51.848
I know you're thinking that with the <i>Pearl</i>

02:12:51.933 --> 02:12:57.087
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

02:12:57.173 --> 02:12:59.812
Doesn't matter now.

02:12:59.893 --> 02:13:02.361
The <i>Pearl</i> is gone,

02:13:02.453 --> 02:13:04.330
along with its captain.

02:13:04.413 --> 02:13:06.529
<i>(Gibbs)</i> Aye.

02:13:06.613 --> 02:13:10.367
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

02:13:10.453 --> 02:13:13.445
He fooled us all right till the end,

02:13:13.533 --> 02:13:17.128
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

02:13:19.893 --> 02:13:21.565
To Jack Sparrow.

02:13:21.653 --> 02:13:26.443
-Never another like Captain Jack.
-He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

02:13:27.013 --> 02:13:29.004
He was a good man.

02:13:48.853 --> 02:13:52.766
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

02:13:54.093 --> 02:13:56.323
-Elizabeth.
-Would you do it?

02:13:56.413 --> 02:13:57.641
Hm?

02:13:58.853 --> 02:14:01.048
What would you...

02:14:01.133 --> 02:14:02.725
Hm?

02:14:04.413 --> 02:14:08.167
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

02:14:09.293 --> 02:14:13.047
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

02:14:13.133 --> 02:14:18.002
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious <i>Pearl</i>?

02:14:23.893 --> 02:14:25.087
Aye.

02:14:26.133 --> 02:14:27.407
Aye.

02:14:28.013 --> 02:14:29.162
Aye.

02:14:29.813 --> 02:14:31.451
<i>(parrot squawks)</i> Aye.

02:14:34.333 --> 02:14:36.324
Yes.

02:14:38.493 --> 02:14:39.687
Aye.

02:14:39.773 --> 02:14:41.684
All right.

02:14:42.693 --> 02:14:49.451
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end...

02:14:50.493 --> 02:14:56.523
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

02:15:10.813 --> 02:15:14.806
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?

02:23:59.333 --> 02:24:01.244
<i>(drumming)</i>
