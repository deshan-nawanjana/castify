00:01:29.506 --> 00:01:30.883
Hey, Melodie.

00:01:31.133 --> 00:01:33.636
- Hey.
- Look, I know

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.268
we've known each other
for a really long time.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:41.735
And we live across the street
from each other and stuff.

00:01:41.852 --> 00:01:43.024
And...

00:01:44.855 --> 00:01:46.949
I know, like, in four days,

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:49.698
I'm sure, if...

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.154
- You know, prom's, like, in four days...
- Oh, my God.

00:01:52.237 --> 00:01:54.080
You're not asking me to prom, are you?

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:01.713
Fuck, no.

00:02:01.788 --> 00:02:03.665
No, I... No, I just...

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:07.253
- You're probably going with someone.
- I'm sorry.

00:02:07.336 --> 00:02:09.088
I don't know how to put this nicely.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.639
There's not a nice way to put it.

00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:12.182
You're a fucking nerd.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.056
And, you know... I don't know. She's hot.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:18.059
Look at her. Look at her.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.558
- Look at her. Look at her. Look at her.
- I'll see you later.

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:22.897
- Bye.
- All right, buddy, good talk.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.478
Dude, classic.

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:28.983
<i>Greg Jenko to the principal's office.
Greg Jenko to the principal's office.</i>

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:30.784
- Shit.
- Good luck, bro.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:32.986
I said loud and clear,

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.415
if you didn't get your grades up,
you weren't going to the prom.

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:39.288
You, my friend, are about to pay the piper.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.253
I should pay who?

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.501
You're not going to the prom.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.833
Boy, you lucky you even graduating.

00:02:47.334 --> 00:02:49.302
But I'm going to be prom king.

00:02:49.378 --> 00:02:51.346
I'm glad you had a great time in school.

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:54.057
'Cause you ain't learned nothing.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.409
Fuck! Fuck!

00:03:28.667 --> 00:03:30.010
Welcome to the Police Academy.

00:03:30.085 --> 00:03:33.464
Make sure your form is completely filled out,
then move along.

00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:39.470
Not-so-slim Shady, what's up? Holy shit!

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.151
Jenko, Schmidt, you're up.

00:03:46.935 --> 00:03:47.936
Oh, fuck!

00:03:50.856 --> 00:03:53.109
- You're good at this, huh?
- Yeah, lam.

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:54.192
Thank you.

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:57.954
Such bullshit.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.576
You're really good at this.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.623
Yeah, I am.

00:04:05.704 --> 00:04:07.206
Hey, you want to be friends?

00:04:10.834 --> 00:04:12.882
Come on. Come on, let's go.

00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:15.722
Come on, pick your knees up.
Pick your knees up.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:18.800
I'm telling you right now, it's not a felony.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:22.309
Chill, all right?
Look, if it has intent, it's a felony.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:29.186
What did I tell you?
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:04:29.269 --> 00:04:31.192
Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:04:31.688 --> 00:04:32.814
Faster. Let's go.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:38.324
Clear!

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.115
Clear!

00:04:41.198 --> 00:04:43.200
Come on, come on, come on! Stop.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:44.830
Yes! Yes!

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.291
Let me see. Let me see.

00:04:52.375 --> 00:04:53.547
Nice.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:57.464
Ten-hut! Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04:57.547 --> 00:05:01.302
I present to you the graduates of Class 137.

00:05:01.384 --> 00:05:04.638
Get ready for a lifetime
of being badass motherfuckers.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.064
I am.

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:18.448
I really thought this job would have
more car chases and explosions,

00:05:18.527 --> 00:05:20.655
and less homeless people
doo-dooing everywhere.

00:05:21.446 --> 00:05:22.993
Do you guys really think
this is a police matter?

00:05:23.073 --> 00:05:24.245
To get your Frisbee back?

00:05:25.951 --> 00:05:27.749
Get your own fucking Frisbee.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.413
Shit.

00:05:31.081 --> 00:05:32.549
Shit! Shit!

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:35.002
Yours isn't loaded, right?

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.213
We're supposed to unload them first, right?

00:05:37.295 --> 00:05:38.672
What, you... No.

00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.348
That's no fun. Come on.

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.016
Sign says, "Do not feed the ducks."

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:43.264
It's right there.

00:05:43.343 --> 00:05:45.391
- Don't you... Don't...
- Don't. Stop it.

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:48.440
Don't. You did it. You fed the ducks.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.312
You feel like a big shot?

00:05:51.226 --> 00:05:52.773
No fucking way.

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:54.779
One Percenters?

00:05:55.522 --> 00:05:56.944
These guys are, like, big-time drug dealers.

00:05:57.023 --> 00:06:01.028
If we could take them down as our first bust,
we'd be off park duty for sure.

00:06:01.611 --> 00:06:03.329
You see what I see?

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:05.282
Cannabis sativa.

00:06:06.324 --> 00:06:07.541
Chaka Khan.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:10.745
Chaka Khan?

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.435
Gentlemen. We having a little party?

00:06:29.514 --> 00:06:31.892
Have we forgotten
that the use of marijuana is illegal?

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:34.527
I have glaucoma.

00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:35.980
I get nervous in crowds.

00:06:36.062 --> 00:06:37.279
Herpes.

00:06:39.316 --> 00:06:41.444
Then you won't mind
if I search your bike, now, would you?

00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:43.912
Go ahead. You won't find shit.

00:06:44.571 --> 00:06:46.790
<i>- Get up.
- Célmate, gringo.</i>

00:06:46.865 --> 00:06:51.416
Man, you guys even real cops?
You look like the kids on Halloween.

00:06:52.996 --> 00:06:56.045
If those boys is cops, I'm DEA.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.510
I know, right? I know.

00:06:59.377 --> 00:07:00.378
It's hilarious.

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:01.930
So why don't you show us a little respect?

00:07:02.005 --> 00:07:03.473
- Fuck you, pig-
- Hey.

00:07:03.924 --> 00:07:05.176
You want me to beat your dick off?

00:07:05.258 --> 00:07:07.306
You want to beat my dick off?

00:07:07.385 --> 00:07:09.228
I'll beat your dick off with both hands.
What's up'? Let's go.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.272
- That's weird, man.
- I think what he was trying to say was,

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.942
he's going to punch you so many times
around the genital area

00:07:14.017 --> 00:07:16.145
that your dick's just going to fall off.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:17.570
Why do you have salt in your...

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.569
- That's actual drugs.
- Oh, my God.

00:07:19.648 --> 00:07:21.275
Get on the ground! Hey!

00:07:21.358 --> 00:07:22.985
- Come here now!
- What do I do?

00:07:23.068 --> 00:07:24.820
- Chase someone!
- Chase someone?

00:07:24.903 --> 00:07:27.702
Are you leaving your bike here?

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:29.290
Okay. All right.

00:07:31.117 --> 00:07:32.994
Don't run from me!
You're making it worse for yourself!

00:07:33.078 --> 00:07:34.421
No! Get out of the way!

00:07:34.496 --> 00:07:35.748
Stop!

00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:40.048
I'm going to shoot you
if you don't slow down, man! Come on!

00:07:42.045 --> 00:07:43.592
Hey! Come here!

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:46.175
I'm not playing any more! I'm so not kidding!

00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:48.134
I got him. I got him.

00:07:54.057 --> 00:07:55.434
Freeze! Freeze!

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.653
Hands up or I shoot you! Freeze!

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.363
That's it! Come here!

00:08:05.735 --> 00:08:07.863
Freeze! Stop it!

00:08:10.615 --> 00:08:12.242
You're a pussy!

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:18.131
You got the right to... Give me that!
You got the right to...

00:08:18.456 --> 00:08:20.550
...to suck my dick, motherfucker!

00:08:20.875 --> 00:08:22.252
My elbow.

00:08:22.627 --> 00:08:24.300
- You got nothing.
- How's my dick feel in your ass, huh?

00:08:24.379 --> 00:08:26.256
- Hey! Hey!
- How's it feel? How's it feel now?

00:08:26.339 --> 00:08:28.967
That's right. Schmidt! Schmidt, we got one!

00:08:29.092 --> 00:08:30.469
We got one! I got him!

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:33.226
Yes! Yes!

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:34.897
- Yeah !
- We got an arrest!

00:08:34.973 --> 00:08:37.317
- Yeah! We got him!
- Yes!

00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.899
- Yeah! Fuck you! Yeah!
- Fuck you! Yeah!

00:08:40.979 --> 00:08:42.026
What's up?

00:08:42.105 --> 00:08:48.488
Drop my nuts
on your motherfucking forehead!

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.823
- That's right.
- Fuck you, park!

00:08:50.905 --> 00:08:52.703
- We arrest people now!
- What up, park?

00:08:52.782 --> 00:08:55.410
- What's up? What's up'?
- What up, park? Who wants one?

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:04.510
Congratulations on the bust, boys.
It sounds great.

00:09:04.586 --> 00:09:06.304
- Thank you, Cinnamon.
- Are those new?

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.890
The department was forced
to drop the charges

00:09:08.965 --> 00:09:11.684
because you forgot to read him
his Miranda rights.

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:16.061
What possible reason is there
for not doing the only thing

00:09:16.139 --> 00:09:18.312
you have to do when arresting someone?

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:22.312
I did read him his right...
I did a version of that.

00:09:22.479 --> 00:09:25.528
- Do you even know the Miranda rights?
- Yes.

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:27.484
Let's hear them, then.

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.615
You got a lot of stuff to do.

00:09:29.694 --> 00:09:31.662
No, go ahead.
You going anywhere, Schmidt?

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:32.830
We got time.

00:09:32.947 --> 00:09:35.416
I had a thing, but I can probably push it back.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:38.746
Go ahead. It's four declamatory sentences,
followed by a question,

00:09:38.828 --> 00:09:40.421
for a total of 57 words.

00:09:40.497 --> 00:09:44.752
Okay. Look, it obviously starts with,
"You have the right to remain silent."

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.838
I know you've heard this before. And then,

00:09:47.921 --> 00:09:51.425
I think it sounds something like...

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:54.808
-"You have the right to an attorney."
- Well, the thing... Yeah, right.

00:09:54.886 --> 00:09:57.480
"You have the right to remain an attorney."

00:09:57.555 --> 00:10:00.604
Did you say
that you have the right to be an attorney?

00:10:00.683 --> 00:10:04.313
You do have the right to be an attorney,
if you want to.

00:10:04.395 --> 00:10:05.521
Where were you?

00:10:06.147 --> 00:10:09.117
I was chasing my perp, sir.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.035
And how did that go for you?

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:13.704
Honestly, he did get away,

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.615
and he threw me down pretty hard.

00:10:15.698 --> 00:10:17.871
Actually fucked up my elbow pretty bad.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:19.077
Can I see that?

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:22.630
Yeah, actually, it hurts
'cause the dirt gets mushed into it.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:25.166
Wow.

00:10:25.583 --> 00:10:26.835
Fortunately for you two,

00:10:26.918 --> 00:10:30.673
we're reviving a canceled
undercover police program from the '80s

00:10:30.755 --> 00:10:32.428
and revamping it for modern times.

00:10:32.507 --> 00:10:33.804
You see, the guys in charge of this stuff

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:37.103
lack creativity
and are completely out of ideas,

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.975
so all they do now
is recycle shit from the past

00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:42.900
and expect us all not to notice.

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:47.193
One of these programs
involves the use of young,

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:48.990
immature-seeming officers.

00:10:49.065 --> 00:10:52.660
Sir, are you saying
that you're going to send us into, like,

00:10:52.735 --> 00:10:55.614
a child sex slavery ring or something?

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:59.292
Sir, if I have to suck somebody's dick, I will.

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:03.125
It's just... I'd prefer not to.

00:11:03.454 --> 00:11:05.297
I think you idiots are perfect.

00:11:05.415 --> 00:11:06.837
You're officially transferred.

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:08.463
- All right. Yeah.
- That's great.

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.261
Where should we report to?

00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.963
Down on Jump Street.

00:11:12.046 --> 00:11:13.923
37 Jump Street.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.143
No, that doesn't sound right.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.432
Is it...

00:11:21.264 --> 00:11:23.232
This has got to be a joke.

00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:25.143
This is it.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.486
Aroma of Christ Church?

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:53.508
How's it going?

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.718
This place is weird.

00:12:09.312 --> 00:12:10.564
Everybody comfortable?

00:12:11.189 --> 00:12:12.315
Yeah.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:18.204
Get your motherfucking ass up
when I'm talking!

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:22.492
You will be going undercover
as high school students.

00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:26.581
You are here simply because you look young.

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.673
You some Justin Beaver,

00:12:28.748 --> 00:12:31.592
Miley Cyrus-looking motherfuckers.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:33.131
Captain Sassy.

00:12:33.419 --> 00:12:34.887
I know what you're thinking,

00:12:35.213 --> 00:12:37.591
"Angry Black Captain."

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:40.268
It ain't nothing but a stupid stereotype.

00:12:40.343 --> 00:12:42.721
Well, guess what, motherfuckers.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.056
I'm black.

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:47.233
And I worked my ass off to be the captain!

00:12:49.727 --> 00:12:51.900
And sometimes I get angry.

00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:53.527
So suck a dick!

00:12:54.107 --> 00:12:55.780
What I'm trying to show you is,

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.948
embrace your stereotypes.

00:12:59.112 --> 00:13:02.036
Like this guy right here. Handsome.

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:03.700
And he's probably a dummy.

00:13:04.909 --> 00:13:05.956
And then this guy.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:09.085
He's short and insecure.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:10.710
And he's probably good with money.

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.134
- You are good with money.
- What the fuck?

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.632
Didn't somebody tell you guys
this was an undercover unit?

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.259
I don't... I actually didn't...

00:13:17.338 --> 00:13:18.555
I didn't get a letter or anything.

00:13:18.756 --> 00:13:21.350
- Yeah, like, a start time...
- With a dress code or anything like that.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.224
Teenage the fuck up!

00:13:25.346 --> 00:13:28.600
Rule number one at Jump Street. Fugazy.

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:30.352
Do not get expelled.

00:13:30.435 --> 00:13:33.484
Nobody in the system knows you're here.
All right? Nobody.

00:13:33.563 --> 00:13:35.156
You get kicked out of school,

00:13:35.231 --> 00:13:38.906
your monkey ass is getting kicked out
of Jump Street.

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.737
Rule number two. Burns.

00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:45.417
Do not have sexual relations
with students or teachers, sir.

00:13:45.742 --> 00:13:48.120
You hear that? That's you.

00:13:48.369 --> 00:13:49.916
- Don't do it, man.
- Why...

00:13:49.996 --> 00:13:52.624
- Keep that dirty dick in your pants.
- Dirty?

00:13:52.707 --> 00:13:54.425
Don't fuck no students.

00:13:54.792 --> 00:13:56.089
Don't fuck no teachers.

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:59.639
Sir, I know we come off
<i>as</i> a couple of lady-killers,

00:13:59.714 --> 00:14:02.888
but I promise you
we will be super professional on the job.

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.436
Clearly, I wasn't talking to you, Big Titties.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.768
You cherub-looking motherfucker.

00:14:07.847 --> 00:14:10.191
I was talking to your partner over here.

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:12.234
Fake-ass Handsome McGee.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.278
When I'm talking to him, I'm talking to him.

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.526
When I say, "Shut the fuck up,"

00:14:15.605 --> 00:14:17.073
- I'm talking to you.
- Cool.

00:14:17.190 --> 00:14:20.694
Now, you two sons of bitches,
in my office now.

00:14:20.777 --> 00:14:21.949
Right now!

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:24.621
<i>Hi. I am Billiam Willingham.</i>

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:26.286
<i>So I bought these,</i>

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.619
<i>which is all anybody seems
to be talking about right now.</i>

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:31.291
<i>Cheers.</i>

00:14:32.121 --> 00:14:33.668
It's a new synthetic drug.

00:14:33.748 --> 00:14:36.922
Goes by the street name H.F.S.

00:14:37.001 --> 00:14:38.969
<i>Holy fucking shit.</i>

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:40.631
<i>Holy...</i>

00:14:40.713 --> 00:14:42.807
They put this on the Internet
for everybody to see?

00:14:42.882 --> 00:14:45.556
They're teenagers, man.
They're really stupid.

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.478
So you should blend right in.

00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:06.824
<i>Jessica, will you go to prom with me?
But I already know the answer. It's yes.</i>

00:15:21.003 --> 00:15:22.721
I could watch this kid all day.

00:15:23.005 --> 00:15:24.382
Man, this kid rules.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:25.846
Ruled.

00:15:25.925 --> 00:15:29.179
His parents found him OD'd
in his room a few days ago.

00:15:29.262 --> 00:15:30.559
He's dead.

00:15:32.265 --> 00:15:35.189
Whatever he took,
the lab has never seen it before.

00:15:35.393 --> 00:15:38.363
And <i>as</i> you can see, this kid is white.

00:15:38.479 --> 00:15:41.198
That means people actually give a shit.

00:15:41.858 --> 00:15:45.237
Sir, I just want to throw out to you
that I would give a shit if he was black.

00:15:48.114 --> 00:15:52.085
Right now, H.F.S.
Is contained right there at Sagan High.

00:15:52.201 --> 00:15:56.456
Now, once this drug breaks containment,
it goes viral in a few days.

00:15:56.622 --> 00:16:00.252
Jenko, I looked at your old transcript.

00:16:00.710 --> 00:16:03.304
I enrolled you in a bunch of bullshit courses

00:16:03.379 --> 00:16:05.427
like photography and drama.

00:16:05.506 --> 00:16:07.929
Get in with the burnouts and the cool kids.

00:16:08.009 --> 00:16:09.761
Find out who's slinging this shit.

00:16:09.844 --> 00:16:12.097
Schmidt, <i>says</i> you were a virgin

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:13.727
-through high school.
- It <i>says</i> that?

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.566
No. I just assumed it,

00:16:15.641 --> 00:16:20.943
due to your many years on the honor roll
and your membership to the juggling squad.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.363
It's the Juggling Society,
but it's fine. it's fine.

00:16:24.442 --> 00:16:26.820
They're stealing equipment
from the chemistry lab.

00:16:26.903 --> 00:16:29.031
That's what we think
they're cooking the dope with.

00:16:29.155 --> 00:16:31.658
I enrolled you into honors chemistry.

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.711
Here's your new identities, all right?

00:16:34.785 --> 00:16:36.628
Brad and Doug McQuaid.

00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:38.498
The mission is this.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:41.004
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

00:16:41.083 --> 00:16:42.926
We get to be brothers?

00:16:43.002 --> 00:16:46.097
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:48.800
But if we find the supplier first,
we don't have to worry about the dealers.

00:16:48.883 --> 00:16:51.636
God damn.
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

00:17:08.027 --> 00:17:09.700
Hey, Korean Jesus.

00:17:10.488 --> 00:17:14.459
I don't know if you only cater
to Korean Christians

00:17:14.575 --> 00:17:18.705
or if you even exist. No offense.

00:17:21.791 --> 00:17:23.213
I just...

00:17:25.044 --> 00:17:28.014
I'm really freaked out
about going back to high school.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:34.479
It was just so fucking hard the first time.

00:17:36.097 --> 00:17:40.477
I know we haven't made our first arrest,
or maybe I'm not the best cop.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:44.147
Korean Jesus,
I just really don't want to fuck this up.

00:17:44.522 --> 00:17:46.820
I'm sorry for swearing so much.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.493
The end?

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:52.947
I don't really know how to end a prayer.
The end?

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.202
Yeah.

00:17:59.745 --> 00:18:00.871
Hey! Hey!

00:18:01.289 --> 00:18:03.337
Stop fucking with Korean Jesus!

00:18:03.457 --> 00:18:05.835
He ain't got time for your problems. He busy!

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:07.465
With Korean shit.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:10.048
- You two get to your mama house ASAP.
- What?

00:18:10.464 --> 00:18:12.808
You're teenagers now, all right?

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:15.102
You two are staying
at Schmidt's parents' house

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:16.895
for the duration of this assignment.

00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:18.348
Fuck me.

00:18:18.931 --> 00:18:21.059
This house is adorable.

00:18:22.101 --> 00:18:23.774
My baby's home! Come here.

00:18:23.853 --> 00:18:25.480
You will always be
my infant angel baby child.

00:18:25.563 --> 00:18:27.281
There's my QW-

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:28.949
It's great to see you guys.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:32.404
- Hey.
- Schmidt family! Up top, Papa Schmidt.

00:18:32.486 --> 00:18:34.614
Oh, my God.
Mama Schmidt, did you do all this yourself?

00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:36.825
- This is unbelievable.
- Well, yeah.

00:18:36.907 --> 00:18:39.126
- I guess I did.
- It's gorgeous!

00:18:39.201 --> 00:18:40.703
So are you.

00:18:40.953 --> 00:18:44.253
Honey, listen, I want to tell you,
we did blow up the air mattress in your room

00:18:44.332 --> 00:18:45.549
'cause we're kind of using that
<i>as</i> a workout area,

00:18:45.666 --> 00:18:47.293
so I hope you don't mind the elliptical.

00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:50.092
No, no! Jenko, Jenko, oh, my God, please.
No, no.

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.048
Don't touch that.
We just brought it back from Sedona.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:54.634
Guys, can we get rid of this stuff?

00:18:54.717 --> 00:18:56.185
I mean, it looks like I died in a car crash

00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:58.479
-and you guys haven't moved on.
- Rid of it?

00:18:58.554 --> 00:19:01.103
If we take it down,
we have to stop bragging about you.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.435
I look like Fred Savage
from The Wonder Years,

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:06.400
but completely naked,
wearing Indian friendship bracelets.

00:19:06.479 --> 00:19:08.481
That is a great picture, Morton.

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:09.907
You look like a young Jay Leno.

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.610
Am I even wearing underwear in this picture?

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:14.995
No.

00:19:15.071 --> 00:19:16.789
I remember. You know why?

00:19:16.864 --> 00:19:19.663
Because I've told it to a therapist
about 8,000 times.

00:19:19.742 --> 00:19:24.088
I mean, this is a fourth grade
participation medal for soccer.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:25.710
It's literally a medal for sucking.

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:27.713
- No, that is a medal for trying.
- Yes.

00:19:27.792 --> 00:19:31.672
Let me tell you something.
This guy was always a great tryer.

00:19:32.755 --> 00:19:34.883
That must be Phyllis.
She is just dying to see you.

00:19:34.965 --> 00:19:38.014
What? Mom, you told Phyllis I was here?
She's going to tell the whole neighborhood.

00:19:38.094 --> 00:19:41.098
I told you, it's an undercover assignment.
It's super secretive.

00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:43.482
"Undercover." That's so cute.

00:19:44.809 --> 00:19:47.232
- I'm going upstairs.
- Okay, honey. I want you to know

00:19:47.311 --> 00:19:48.733
-we are so glad you're here.
- Okay.

00:19:48.813 --> 00:19:50.781
That's great. Thank you.

00:19:50.856 --> 00:19:53.109
- All right. Where is he?
- He's upstairs.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.991
He just needs to take a little rest,
and then he's dying to see you, too.

00:19:56.070 --> 00:19:58.368
- Bye-bye.
- I baked muffins!

00:19:58.739 --> 00:20:00.833
If you don't know your identity,
we're screwed tomorrow.

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.202
You got to study this stuff.

00:20:02.284 --> 00:20:05.163
Forget those identities. They're bullshit.
They said I was held back a year.

00:20:05.246 --> 00:20:06.964
You were. You were held back two years.

00:20:07.039 --> 00:20:10.134
Just 'cause it's a fake backstory
doesn't mean it doesn't hurt my feelings.

00:20:10.209 --> 00:20:12.462
Fuck! Socks don't match.

00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:13.967
I got to start all over.

00:20:14.296 --> 00:20:16.139
It's the first day of school, dude.
I got to look awesome.

00:20:16.841 --> 00:20:18.969
You know, back in the day,
you were super popular,

00:20:19.051 --> 00:20:21.770
and I wasn't as much.

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.350
We didn't really get along in high school.

00:20:26.559 --> 00:20:28.482
You don't think that's going to happen again,
do you'?

00:20:28.811 --> 00:20:32.532
No. Come on, man. We're adults now.
We're best buds.

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:33.983
It's definitely not going to happen again.

00:20:34.066 --> 00:20:35.659
- We're good.
- Cool.

00:20:42.575 --> 00:20:44.669
Beautiful day out there, boys.

00:20:45.453 --> 00:20:46.875
Just shut up.

00:20:47.663 --> 00:20:50.712
"Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

00:20:50.791 --> 00:20:52.008
"You have the right to an attorney.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:55.133
"If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed..."

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:58.591
Dude, do you still not know
the Miranda rights? You're a cop.

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:02.679
Come on, man. They always cut away on TV
before they finish them.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.066
All right, let's do it.

00:21:07.224 --> 00:21:08.942
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

00:21:09.018 --> 00:21:10.019
What are you doing?

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.025
- What? What are you talking about?
- Are you two-strapping?

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:15.734
- My backpack? Yeah.
- Yeah, I got to be seen with you.

00:21:16.066 --> 00:21:17.613
You got to one-strap it.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:20.287
Seriously, I would no-strap it
if that would even be possible.

00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:21.739
Okay, what makes you the expert?

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:24.166
I was cool in high school, and you weren't.

00:21:24.533 --> 00:21:26.206
Okay, that makes sense. Continue.

00:21:27.203 --> 00:21:31.800
The Three Keys of Coolness in High School,
by Jenko.

00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:35.253
One, don't try hard at anything.

00:21:35.336 --> 00:21:38.636
Okay? Two, make fun of people who do try.

00:21:38.714 --> 00:21:40.637
Three, be handsome.

00:21:40.716 --> 00:21:42.969
Four, if anyone steps to you
on the first day of school,

00:21:43.052 --> 00:21:45.100
you punch them directly in the face.

00:21:45.179 --> 00:21:47.557
Five, drive a kick-ass car.

00:21:48.724 --> 00:21:49.896
Shit.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.357
All right, but just don't be driving it
like teenagers,

00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.284
revving up the engine and shit, okay?

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:00.907
We would never.

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.243
Come on, Hoffs. Give us a little credit.

00:22:05.991 --> 00:22:07.743
- Hey' You ready?
- Go! '

00:22:15.084 --> 00:22:17.257
That was awesome! That was amazing.

00:22:17.461 --> 00:22:19.429
- Was I flying'?
- That was amazing.

00:22:19.505 --> 00:22:20.802
All right, do mine, do mine.

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:23.430
- Okay, ready? Here I go.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:22:29.598 --> 00:22:31.100
You okay?

00:22:32.142 --> 00:22:33.940
I think I shit my pants.

00:22:41.527 --> 00:22:42.619
Hey, park in that handicapped spot.

00:22:42.695 --> 00:22:45.494
- It'll make us look cool.
- That's awesome.

00:23:00.796 --> 00:23:01.968
Dude?

00:23:02.047 --> 00:23:04.926
- Everybody's two-strapping it.
- Just stay with the one-strap.

00:23:05.259 --> 00:23:06.886
I can't. I can't. I can't right now.

00:23:06.969 --> 00:23:09.563
What are you doing? What are you doing?
Don't succumb to the peer pressure.

00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:11.231
- What are you doing?
- You're supposed to use two straps.

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:13.901
- One strap is peer pressure.
- No. No. You're fucking up right now.

00:23:14.184 --> 00:23:15.936
Okay, those are Goths.

00:23:17.521 --> 00:23:18.989
Those are nerds.

00:23:20.983 --> 00:23:22.451
I don't know what they are.

00:23:24.153 --> 00:23:26.702
What the fuck are those things?

00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:28.157
I'm so confused right now.

00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:36.832
Whoa.

00:23:39.043 --> 00:23:41.137
- Hi.
- Hey.

00:23:41.211 --> 00:23:42.963
- Hey.
- Good morning.

00:23:44.173 --> 00:23:46.426
Hey, yo. HEY-

00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:49.561
- Is that your car?
- Yeah.

00:23:49.637 --> 00:23:51.230
What's that thing get, 10 miles to the gallon?

00:23:51.305 --> 00:23:53.057
No, try, like, seven.

00:23:54.183 --> 00:23:56.060
- What about you?
- Biodiesel, dawg.

00:23:56.268 --> 00:23:57.520
Smells like egg rolls.

00:23:57.603 --> 00:24:01.403
Yeah, it does.
Runs on leftover fry oil from Hunan Palace.

00:24:01.482 --> 00:24:04.702
But we try to ride bikes when we can.
Global crisis and whatnot.

00:24:05.194 --> 00:24:07.663
Whatever, man. I don't care about anything.

00:24:07.738 --> 00:24:10.457
You don't care about the environment?
That's kind of fucked up, man.

00:24:10.532 --> 00:24:12.125
Hey, hey, will y'all shut the hell up?

00:24:12.201 --> 00:24:13.919
I'm trying to study. Thanks.

00:24:14.536 --> 00:24:17.585
Look at him. He's trying.

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.508
He's actually trying. What a nerd.

00:24:19.583 --> 00:24:21.460
Look at the nerd. Look at the nerd.

00:24:21.543 --> 00:24:23.796
- Look at him. Look at the nerd.
- Who you calling a nerd, man?

00:24:23.879 --> 00:24:25.222
I'm sorry. What...

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.967
- Shit!
- Shit, dude.

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.144
Are you okay, man'? Hey, what the hell?
Are you serious?

00:24:30.219 --> 00:24:31.892
Well, turn that gay-ass music off.

00:24:31.971 --> 00:24:33.848
- You punched me because I'm gay?
- What?

00:24:34.056 --> 00:24:36.650
No. Come on.

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:37.897
That's not cool, man.

00:24:37.977 --> 00:24:39.194
That is really insensitive.

00:24:39.269 --> 00:24:40.612
I didn't punch him because he's gay.

00:24:40.688 --> 00:24:44.818
I punched him, and then he happened
to turn out to be gay afterwards.

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.948
- I was gay when you punched me!
- In a weird way,

00:24:47.027 --> 00:24:49.371
it might have been
homophobic not to punch you

00:24:49.446 --> 00:24:51.289
-just because you were gay.
- Right.

00:24:51.365 --> 00:24:53.367
You punched a little gay
black kid in the face,

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:55.794
and it's not even second period.
How do you explain that?

00:24:56.078 --> 00:24:58.581
Mr. Dadier, I'm so sorry about that. I just...

00:24:58.664 --> 00:25:00.211
Look, guys, I'm going to relate to you, okay?

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:03.044
A kid died the other day from drugs,

00:25:03.127 --> 00:25:06.472
and nobody, including me,
is doing anything about it.

00:25:07.256 --> 00:25:08.974
That's weird, guys.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:12.053
And then you two show up, with 30 days left,

00:25:12.136 --> 00:25:14.355
causing trouble in my school.

00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:17.274
I am one more black gay kid
getting punched in the face

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:20.774
away from a nervous breakdown.
Do I make myself clear?

00:25:20.853 --> 00:25:22.105
You guys cross my line again,

00:25:22.271 --> 00:25:26.697
and you walk into this office,
I'm going to expel you. You got me?

00:25:26.775 --> 00:25:30.120
All right, let's do this.
Which one of you is Doug?

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.620
Let's do that again
and pretend you guys aren't weird.

00:25:33.824 --> 00:25:36.122
Which one of you is named Doug?

00:25:36.410 --> 00:25:38.287
- No, dude, I'm Brad.
- Okay, good.

00:25:38.412 --> 00:25:40.585
So that means your name is Doug, son.

00:25:40.664 --> 00:25:42.166
- Yeah, I'm Doug.
- Great.

00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:43.588
Here are your class schedules.

00:25:43.667 --> 00:25:46.295
Funny, I wouldn't have taken you
for the brainy type.

00:25:46.378 --> 00:25:49.097
I wouldn't.
But you <i>as</i> a drama geek, far less surprising.

00:25:49.173 --> 00:25:50.550
Thank you.

00:25:50.632 --> 00:25:52.259
Now we have the wrong identities,
you dumb-ass.

00:25:52.342 --> 00:25:55.471
I'm in drama. I suck at drama.
It's girly and embarrassing.

00:25:55.554 --> 00:25:57.977
Oh, my God. Relax, dude. Who cares?

00:25:58.098 --> 00:26:01.352
I can fake my way through band practice
and app chemistry for a few weeks.

00:26:01.435 --> 00:26:04.735
AP Chemistry. AP Chemistry.
And, no, you can't,

00:26:04.813 --> 00:26:06.736
because you don't even know
what it's actually fucking called!

00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:10.449
It's going to be fine. You go to my classes,
and I'm going to go to yours.

00:26:10.527 --> 00:26:12.621
Okay, now, chemistry's
the one with the shapes and shit, right?

00:26:13.030 --> 00:26:14.031
Fuck.

00:26:14.531 --> 00:26:18.786
So, we are going to hold auditions
for the Peter Pan part today.

00:26:19.703 --> 00:26:23.173
Billiam would've wanted the show to go on.

00:26:23.707 --> 00:26:27.302
When I was a young actorjust starting out
in New York state,

00:26:27.377 --> 00:26:28.799
Albany, to be exact,

00:26:28.879 --> 00:26:31.098
- I booked a local television commercial...
- Hey.

00:26:31.173 --> 00:26:33.175
...In which I had to play a young man...

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:36.182
It's really sad about that kid. He was talented.

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:40.274
So are you saying if he wasn't talented,
it would be less sad?

00:26:40.682 --> 00:26:43.902
No. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.

00:26:45.229 --> 00:26:47.357
I was just busting your balls.

00:26:49.358 --> 00:26:51.360
Okay. Good.

00:26:52.069 --> 00:26:56.620
I remember, one time,
doing cocaine with Willie Nelson's horse,

00:26:58.367 --> 00:27:00.369
and we were having so much fun.

00:27:00.452 --> 00:27:03.672
And then I realized that she was dead.

00:27:05.666 --> 00:27:06.792
I remember one summer...

00:27:06.959 --> 00:27:08.882
Do kids still do this stuff?

00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:10.754
Even after what happened to him?

00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:14.346
Everyone's saying
that Billiam had a heart murmur.

00:27:14.424 --> 00:27:17.519
Pretty much everyone I know does it,
but it's not my thing.

00:27:17.886 --> 00:27:19.888
It's not really my thing, either,

00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:22.771
but a buddy of mine really wants it.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.774
Who would he call if he wanted it?

00:27:25.853 --> 00:27:27.981
Well, you can tell your friend

00:27:28.063 --> 00:27:30.407
that if he really wanted it,

00:27:30.482 --> 00:27:32.484
it's not so hard to find.

00:27:32.568 --> 00:27:34.991
When to take it.
He shouldn't have been taking it at all.

00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.913
Drugs are bad.

00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:41.161
But they can have their place
in the life of a professional actor.

00:27:41.243 --> 00:27:43.211
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:27:43.287 --> 00:27:45.255
Notice the distinction.
I said "professional actor."

00:27:49.918 --> 00:27:52.762
New person. Mr. Texty Texty.

00:27:52.838 --> 00:27:55.717
Since you have so much to say to Molly,

00:27:55.841 --> 00:27:58.264
let's see if you can be Peter to our Wendy.

00:27:58.343 --> 00:28:01.222
You look like you might have
a little Peter inside of you.

00:28:02.681 --> 00:28:05.810
I can't.
I'm fine just being a tree or something

00:28:05.934 --> 00:28:08.028
Doug, you never won't know

00:28:08.103 --> 00:28:11.607
what you can't achieve
before you don't achieve it.

00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:12.816
My point is,

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:15.699
you have to. Everyone auditions for Peter.

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:18.622
Yeah, sure.

00:28:19.072 --> 00:28:20.745
My favorite molecule is water.

00:28:20.824 --> 00:28:23.122
I'd marry it, unless it was my daughter

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:27.756
Its solid form floats on its liquid form,
which makes it far outside the norm.

00:28:27.831 --> 00:28:32.132
It allowed life to form on ancient Mars,
and we use it to wash our cars.

00:28:32.878 --> 00:28:34.050
H2O.

00:28:34.296 --> 00:28:36.799
H2O. H2O.

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:39.142
- H20
- It's okay. Thank you.

00:28:40.510 --> 00:28:42.979
Thank you, Zack. So good.

00:28:43.055 --> 00:28:45.854
All right, anybody else
for Molecule Mondays? Anyone?

00:28:46.725 --> 00:28:48.568
Okay. Time for a pop Quiznos.

00:28:48.936 --> 00:28:49.937
A what?

00:28:50.562 --> 00:28:51.859
I'm sorry.

00:28:51.939 --> 00:28:53.441
What is your name? Brad?

00:28:53.690 --> 00:28:55.408
- Brad. Yes, ma'am.
- Wow. Look at you,

00:28:55.484 --> 00:28:57.111
Brad. Big.

00:28:59.029 --> 00:29:00.702
What is a pop Quiznos?

00:29:00.864 --> 00:29:07.167
It's a quiz, and the first person who finishes
gets a $10 gift certificate to Quiznos.

00:29:07.704 --> 00:29:10.332
- Today's quiz is on...
- You look really old.

00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:14.512
- Were you held back or something or...
- No. You look super young.

00:29:14.586 --> 00:29:16.463
Were you held forward?

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:19.637
I went to school in France, so

00:29:19.716 --> 00:29:23.186
And they do, like, two extra years
of middle school there. It's so lame.

00:29:23.345 --> 00:29:26.098
French, the language of love.

00:29:26.515 --> 00:29:28.813
That's cool, man. It's nice to meet you also.

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:30.860
Hey.

00:29:33.021 --> 00:29:34.364
Good luck.

00:29:49.413 --> 00:29:51.336
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

00:29:53.333 --> 00:29:54.630
<i>I'm just the cleverest...</i>

00:29:55.002 --> 00:29:56.094
Okay.

00:29:58.005 --> 00:30:00.599
Maybe try one cooler.

00:30:01.591 --> 00:30:02.968
And faster.

00:30:03.927 --> 00:30:06.555
And louder. And better.

00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:10.393
And less insecure and more just cool.

00:30:15.981 --> 00:30:17.983
Okay, yeah, those are great notes.

00:30:18.066 --> 00:30:19.238
I'm going to run outside,

00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:22.117
and I'm going to utilize those,
and I'm going to come back.

00:30:33.415 --> 00:30:34.416
It's such bullshit.

00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:43.971
Wow. You're fast.

00:30:44.551 --> 00:30:46.804
Not like that. Just, let me check you out.

00:30:47.137 --> 00:30:49.185
Let me check out your chest.

00:30:49.264 --> 00:30:50.982
Check out your test... Let me...

00:30:51.058 --> 00:30:52.605
Let me grade your quiz.

00:30:57.147 --> 00:30:58.990
Can I go take a dump?

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.368
Yeah, okay. That's cool.

00:31:03.487 --> 00:31:06.161
We have this "hurry back" rule,

00:31:06.239 --> 00:31:09.288
so if you're not back in six minutes,
I have to send you to the principal.

00:31:10.118 --> 00:31:11.791
Rules are rules, so,

00:31:12.371 --> 00:31:15.045
I guess this will have to be a quickie.

00:31:15.457 --> 00:31:16.879
- Which way is yearbook?
- I don't know.

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:18.005
- Is it this way?
- I don't know!

00:31:33.683 --> 00:31:36.061
- Yo.
- Hey.

00:31:36.144 --> 00:31:37.145
YOU guys, huh?

00:31:38.897 --> 00:31:41.616
That was a total mix-up,
what happened earlier.

00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:42.817
- Yeah.
- He feels awful. He feels...

00:31:42.901 --> 00:31:44.744
Totally, very nervous.

00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:47.114
You're the dealer?

00:31:47.197 --> 00:31:48.244
- You're the dealer guy?
- Is that you?

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:49.954
Yep.

00:31:50.033 --> 00:31:51.159
So do you make the stuff or...

00:31:51.243 --> 00:31:53.996
Do I look like a fucking scientist?
No, I just sell it.

00:31:54.329 --> 00:31:56.627
- Yeah, he just sells it. Come on
- Yeah, no, I'm sorry.

00:31:56.706 --> 00:31:58.674
- I meant I just...
- How many you guys want?

00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:00.422
20 bucks a pop.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:04.390
One each? One pop each of drugs.

00:32:04.965 --> 00:32:06.012
You guys aren't narcs, are you?

00:32:06.299 --> 00:32:07.300
Whoa!

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:10.228
- Dude, come on.
- No! Maybe you're a narc.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.188
You know who calls people narcs?

00:32:12.264 --> 00:32:13.857
Narcs, narc.

00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:17.144
First of all, your argument
kind of just collapsed on itself,

00:32:17.227 --> 00:32:18.945
because if you call us narcs,

00:32:19.729 --> 00:32:22.778
if narcs call people narcs,
and you call us narcs, then that's kind of...

00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:24.701
-'Cause you just said that.
- They call people...

00:32:24.776 --> 00:32:27.074
Look, I don't have time for this shit.
You guys want to do this or not?

00:32:27.154 --> 00:32:28.246
- Jesus.
- Yes.

00:32:28.321 --> 00:32:30.198
- Yes, yes.
- No problem.

00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.827
All right, take it here so I know you're cool.

00:32:33.910 --> 00:32:35.002
I'm sorry. What?

00:32:35.996 --> 00:32:38.124
- We were going to take it home.
- I gotta go back to class,

00:32:38.206 --> 00:32:40.584
-is the only thing.
- I was thinking that I was going to go home,

00:32:40.709 --> 00:32:42.177
maybe turn down the lights,

00:32:42.252 --> 00:32:43.629
getting snuggy, get a little weird.

00:32:43.712 --> 00:32:45.464
I was going to take it,
and then masturbate later.

00:32:45.547 --> 00:32:48.391
Okay, I'm not asking.
Take it now or get the fuck out.

00:32:48.467 --> 00:32:50.435
I got to finish the girls' volleyball page
by lunch.

00:32:52.512 --> 00:32:53.604
Yeah?

00:32:55.765 --> 00:32:57.733
Yeah, no, it's all good.

00:32:57.809 --> 00:33:01.484
- I love doing drugs at school.
- I'll just take the drugs right here,

00:33:01.813 --> 00:33:03.156
in our mouths.

00:33:03.356 --> 00:33:04.903
There you go. That's it.

00:33:10.989 --> 00:33:13.538
What is that? Barbecue? Cool Ranch?

00:33:13.742 --> 00:33:14.994
Have fun.

00:33:16.411 --> 00:33:17.788
- You got to pull the trigger!
- Okay.

00:33:17.871 --> 00:33:19.498
You got to pull the trigger!

00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:21.379
- We got to throw up, man.
- I can't.

00:33:21.458 --> 00:33:23.506
We gotta throw up. That kid, Billiam, died.
We got to throw up.

00:33:23.585 --> 00:33:25.303
Just think of something gross.
Think of something gross.

00:33:25.378 --> 00:33:28.006
- You fucking think of something.
- Okay, all right, all right.

00:33:28.089 --> 00:33:30.558
Your grandma's vagina,
and there's a dick going into it.

00:33:30.634 --> 00:33:32.511
- What the fuck are you saying?
- I don't know! I'm just trying!

00:33:32.594 --> 00:33:34.312
- I'm trying my best! I'm just trying!
- Fuck! Come on, man!

00:33:34.387 --> 00:33:36.264
Dude, let's just finger each other's mouths.

00:33:36.765 --> 00:33:37.937
- No!
- Yeah.

00:33:38.016 --> 00:33:39.142
No, you're not fingering my mouth.

00:33:39.226 --> 00:33:41.945
- Do you wanna die? Do you wanna die?
- Okay, fine!

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.739
Let's go. Come on. Come on! Come on!

00:33:52.155 --> 00:33:54.078
What are you doing?
Are you trying to find my G-spot?

00:33:54.157 --> 00:33:56.159
- Just stick it in!
- I don't know. I've never done this before!

00:33:56.243 --> 00:33:57.369
Just stick it in! Go!

00:34:02.999 --> 00:34:04.421
Cut your fucking fingernails!

00:34:06.419 --> 00:34:07.636
Oh, God!

00:34:09.256 --> 00:34:10.758
Is it me?

00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.183
I'm sorry.

00:34:12.259 --> 00:34:13.351
I just can't sometimes.

00:34:14.386 --> 00:34:16.184
Think we're going to be fine.
I don't feel anything.

00:34:16.263 --> 00:34:17.685
Me, neither.

00:34:17.806 --> 00:34:19.353
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:22.769
You got a pass for running around
the hallways like a couple of ding-a-lings?

00:34:22.894 --> 00:34:24.567
<i>Pass,</i> in your hand.

00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:25.818
Hello.

00:34:26.356 --> 00:34:28.575
Damn. You guys are late.

00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:30.402
Now I'm going to have to take you
to the principal's office.

00:34:30.485 --> 00:34:34.615
- No, no, no, man. Come on, please. Sorry.
- Come on, please.

00:34:34.698 --> 00:34:36.700
You have exceptional muscle tone there,
young man.

00:34:36.992 --> 00:34:39.290
When'd you go through puberty?
Like, at seven or something?

00:34:39.619 --> 00:34:41.587
You look like you're in your mid-20s,
for crying out loud.

00:34:42.038 --> 00:34:44.507
McQuaid, huh? Doug McQuaid.

00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:45.630
I read your file.

00:34:45.875 --> 00:34:48.845
You got a lot of something special
going on there, young man.

00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:51.093
What the hell was that? God damn it, son!

00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:53.015
Don't ever raise your hand to me like that
again, all right?

00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:54.263
I consider that a threat.

00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:56.094
I was just saying that I'm Doug.

00:34:56.177 --> 00:34:59.021
I'm Doug McQuaid. See, that's Brad.

00:34:59.848 --> 00:35:00.849
That's Brad.

00:35:00.932 --> 00:35:03.435
You're the new kid who's All County in track?

00:35:03.518 --> 00:35:05.316
Yes, I'm Doug McQuaid,

00:35:06.187 --> 00:35:10.693
the track star, and this is Brad,
the science prodigy.

00:35:13.194 --> 00:35:15.322
He's really fast.

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:20.042
Is this funny to you guys?

00:35:27.834 --> 00:35:30.257
So you're Doug. You're Doug. You're Doug.

00:35:30.337 --> 00:35:31.554
You're Doug. You're Doug.

00:35:31.838 --> 00:35:33.215
Here's the deal.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:36.139
My track team is full
of physically incapable rejects.

00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:39.270
I mean, if I wasn't the coach,
I'd be laughing my ass off

00:35:39.346 --> 00:35:42.725
at how spastic they are, but I am the coach,

00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:44.776
so I need you.

00:35:45.393 --> 00:35:47.145
I need me some Doug McQuaid.

00:35:47.228 --> 00:35:48.354
Understand?

00:35:48.855 --> 00:35:52.576
I need you to run anchor on the 4 X 400
at today's track meet.

00:35:52.651 --> 00:35:55.245
You do that, and I'll sign this pass.

00:35:55.904 --> 00:35:57.372
Don't blow on me, son.

00:35:58.073 --> 00:36:00.201
I haven't trained.

00:36:00.450 --> 00:36:03.920
Guys, don't make me take you
to the principal's office.

00:36:04.412 --> 00:36:06.085
Do we have a deal?

00:36:07.749 --> 00:36:08.875
Yes.

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:11.093
Nice.

00:36:13.713 --> 00:36:16.717
I don't like that.
Put your tongue back in your mouth.

00:36:16.883 --> 00:36:18.430
Put your tongue in your mouth, and close it

00:36:19.094 --> 00:36:21.222
What are you doing? Stop it.

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.598
Actually, that's not bad.

00:36:23.682 --> 00:36:25.605
All right, here you go.

00:36:27.602 --> 00:36:29.479
Are you guys on drugs?

00:36:35.235 --> 00:36:36.236
Okay.

00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:38.993
One particle of Unobtainium has
a nuclear reaction with a flux capacitor.

00:36:39.114 --> 00:36:42.618
Carry the two, changing its atomic isotoner
into a radioactive spider.

00:36:44.828 --> 00:36:46.455
Fuck you, science!

00:36:52.919 --> 00:36:54.717
All right, all right, we're good.

00:36:54.796 --> 00:36:56.719
We're good. We're good, man. We're good.

00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:58.471
We're good, baby.

00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:00.977
Good work. Hit that shit.

00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:11.734
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:14.316
<i>I'm just the cleverest fellow</i>

00:37:14.399 --> 00:37:18.029
<i>'Twas ever my fortune to know</i>

00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:21.115
<i>I taught a trick to my shadow</i>

00:37:21.197 --> 00:37:24.246
<i>To stick to the tip of my toe</i>

00:37:24.993 --> 00:37:28.372
<i>I've gotta crow</i>

00:37:29.497 --> 00:37:33.218
<i>I've gotta</i>

00:37:33.293 --> 00:37:38.515
<i>Crow!</i>

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:41.176
Christoph, did you feel that?

00:37:41.259 --> 00:37:42.681
Who are you?

00:37:46.389 --> 00:37:48.562
Welcome aboard, Peter.

00:37:59.235 --> 00:38:00.703
No, keep it going!

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.914
Keep it going. That was so tight!

00:38:03.031 --> 00:38:04.248
No, no, no, keep it going. Keep it going.

00:38:08.787 --> 00:38:11.006
All right, let's go, McQuaid!

00:38:11.247 --> 00:38:12.794
All right! Yeah!

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:15.214
I like it! I like the confidence, son!

00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:18.846
I know y'all seen this shit before.

00:38:18.922 --> 00:38:20.344
I know you've seen this shit before.

00:38:20.465 --> 00:38:23.093
Huge lead! Huge lead! We got this. All right.

00:38:23.218 --> 00:38:25.061
You're looking amped!

00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:28.394
Here we go.

00:38:28.473 --> 00:38:29.816
Here we go! Here we go!

00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:32.067
Hey, pick it up!

00:38:32.143 --> 00:38:35.238
Hey, no, McQuaid, pick it up.
What are you doing?

00:38:37.273 --> 00:38:38.365
What are you doing? Pick it...

00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:40.610
What? McQuaid!

00:38:41.486 --> 00:38:44.114
Don't throw the baton, you jackass!

00:38:44.739 --> 00:38:45.991
Come on!

00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:47.747
McQuaid!

00:38:47.826 --> 00:38:49.954
Run that way!

00:38:50.078 --> 00:38:53.173
Spike that! Fuck you, Miles Davis!

00:38:55.583 --> 00:38:58.132
Let's go, God damn it! Let's do this!

00:38:58.253 --> 00:38:59.505
Let's go! Come on!

00:38:59.838 --> 00:39:01.181
Oh, my God.

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:03.390
No, no.

00:39:03.925 --> 00:39:05.268
No, stop.

00:39:05.552 --> 00:39:06.849
Come here. Come here.

00:39:06.928 --> 00:39:08.350
Don't make a...

00:39:08.429 --> 00:39:09.931
That is a baton penis.

00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:21.534
Speak of the devil!

00:39:21.609 --> 00:39:24.283
Dude, that was awesome
how you sabotaged that track meet, man.

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.615
Organized sports are so fascist.
It makes me sick.

00:39:27.073 --> 00:39:28.575
That's just what I do.

00:39:28.783 --> 00:39:30.626
Okay. Shit, man. See you around, all right?

00:39:33.955 --> 00:39:35.957
I don't get this school.

00:39:36.958 --> 00:39:38.460
That was awesome.

00:39:40.295 --> 00:39:42.138
Okay, so we stayed up all night making this.

00:39:42.213 --> 00:39:43.590
It's awesome. You're really going to like it.

00:39:43.673 --> 00:39:45.471
All yarn work was done by Jenko.

00:39:45.550 --> 00:39:47.598
Okay, Captain, look,
the dealers are the popular kids,

00:39:47.677 --> 00:39:48.894
but they're not normal popular.

00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.439
They're these crunchy granola dudes
that have convinced everyone

00:39:51.514 --> 00:39:52.857
that they're cool, and they're not cool.

00:39:53.141 --> 00:39:55.018
It's backwards and unnatural,
and it's got to be stopped.

00:39:55.351 --> 00:39:57.820
Lead dealer, Eric Molson. Alpha dog.

00:39:57.896 --> 00:39:59.990
Sick chicks, killer steeze.

00:40:00.106 --> 00:40:01.278
Did the AIDS run this year.

00:40:01.649 --> 00:40:03.902
He's getting into Berkeley, early admish,

00:40:03.985 --> 00:40:05.362
and he totally gets me.

00:40:05.445 --> 00:40:07.743
Who put this together'? Are you autistic?

00:40:07.822 --> 00:40:09.699
It is artistic, sir, because the thing is,

00:40:09.782 --> 00:40:12.126
-the yarn actually indicates...
- We're compiling a list

00:40:12.201 --> 00:40:14.249
of suspicious types at school.
The users are here.

00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:16.627
This kid was actually talking
to a tree this morning.

00:40:16.706 --> 00:40:17.798
Cut the bullshit!

00:40:17.999 --> 00:40:20.468
I want to know who's the supplier.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:23.463
We don't know. That's why
there's a question mark on his face.

00:40:23.546 --> 00:40:25.719
That's not the way his face looks.
That's just a question mark.

00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:28.426
Infiltrate the dealers, find the supplier.

00:40:28.551 --> 00:40:29.723
Simple.

00:40:29.969 --> 00:40:33.018
Sounds like you guys
really cracked the whole case.

00:40:33.139 --> 00:40:34.561
Great job. You guys are on fire

00:40:34.974 --> 00:40:36.976
- So proud.
- Like you could do any better?

00:40:37.143 --> 00:40:38.941
We just brought down a group
of wannabe thugs

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:41.364
stripping down cars
in the Garfield High metal shop.

00:40:41.689 --> 00:40:44.568
- What?
- Meanwhile, you two were standing around

00:40:44.651 --> 00:40:46.528
finger-popping each other's assholes.

00:40:46.611 --> 00:40:49.205
We're not finger-popping
each other's assholes.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.783
What we're doing is getting shit done.

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.292
<i>Yeah, as a matter of fact,</i>

00:40:53.368 --> 00:40:54.995
<i>I'm about to infiltrate a super high-tech</i>

00:40:55.078 --> 00:40:58.423
<i>drug manufacturing ring
in the chemistry classroom.</i>

00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:07.132
- Password!
- Open the door!

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:09.183
- You have to say the password.
- I'm sorry. What?

00:41:09.258 --> 00:41:10.635
What are you...

00:41:12.220 --> 00:41:13.392
Geez.

00:41:17.225 --> 00:41:19.227
What are y'all doing?
How'd you get a key in here?

00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:22.564
Ms. Griggs gave us one
so we could work, tutor, deal Bakugan.

00:41:23.064 --> 00:41:24.987
Bakugan? You dealing drugs?

00:41:25.274 --> 00:41:26.651
- Let me see. You dealing drugs?
- No.

00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:28.577
It's just a card game.
It's, like, a hybrid card game.

00:41:28.778 --> 00:41:30.496
- See? They open up.
- Battle Brawlers.

00:41:30.571 --> 00:41:32.414
- You're not doing anything illegal?
- No.

00:41:32.657 --> 00:41:36.036
- What are you doing in here?
- I'm here to study.

00:41:36.536 --> 00:41:38.630
Good. You could use it.
You're pretty far behind, so...

00:41:38.913 --> 00:41:40.790
You're behind. I'm ahead.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.088
- I know everything.
- Really'?

00:41:43.209 --> 00:41:44.927
What's a covalent bond?

00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:47.005
Fuck you, man. I don't need to tell you.

00:41:47.088 --> 00:41:49.557
I wasn't trying to be rude. Sorry

00:41:49.757 --> 00:41:52.351
I just... I don't think you know everything.

00:41:52.635 --> 00:41:53.727
I know everything.

00:41:54.303 --> 00:41:55.475
Okay.

00:42:02.729 --> 00:42:06.279
What kind of bullshit do they say
about a covalent bond in this school?

00:42:06.607 --> 00:42:10.703
They say it's when two atoms
share both their electrons.

00:42:10.778 --> 00:42:12.371
It helps them to stick together.

00:42:13.114 --> 00:42:15.663
I could help you out if you want,
tutor you for the test.

00:42:16.367 --> 00:42:18.745
What are you doing
with all those phones anyway?

00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:21.873
I crack and jailbreak kids' phones
to try and save for college.

00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:24.709
You know, I switch their wireless carriers,
get them restricted apps.

00:42:24.792 --> 00:42:26.009
Can you listen in on phone calls and stuff?

00:42:26.085 --> 00:42:29.965
No, no, I can't install a spyvvare
to remotely monitor calls

00:42:30.048 --> 00:42:31.425
or anything that the mic picks up.

00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:33.935
- I can't do that at all.
- Wait, you can't do it?

00:42:34.135 --> 00:42:35.557
No, I can't.

00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:38.723
- Is he being sarcastic?
- I don't know.

00:42:39.974 --> 00:42:41.100
So you can.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.278
Liking comic books is popular.

00:42:47.356 --> 00:42:50.109
Environmental awareness, being tolerant.

00:42:50.193 --> 00:42:53.367
If I was just born 10 years later,
I would have been the coolest person ever.

00:42:53.488 --> 00:42:55.365
I know. It's bullshit.

00:42:56.783 --> 00:42:57.909
You know what?

00:42:57.992 --> 00:43:00.336
I totally know the cause.

00:43:00.411 --> 00:43:02.834
<i>Glee. Fuck you, Glee.</i>

00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:05.841
Man, I got to say, this is kind of awesome.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.050
I might become popular.
I might get in with the popular kids.

00:43:10.963 --> 00:43:14.388
We just have to do something
wildly irresponsible to earn their trust.

00:43:14.509 --> 00:43:15.635
You saying we should throw a party?

00:43:15.885 --> 00:43:18.604
I'll invite Molly,
and then Molly will invite Eric,

00:43:18.930 --> 00:43:20.728
and that'll be the quickest way for me
to bro down with him.

00:43:20.807 --> 00:43:23.185
Wouldn't it be better if we both infiltrated
the cool kids' group?

00:43:23.267 --> 00:43:24.644
I think it would be better if you get in

00:43:24.727 --> 00:43:26.274
with the nerdy kids
and see what's going on over there.

00:43:26.354 --> 00:43:27.856
That'd be the best thing for the case.

00:43:28.314 --> 00:43:30.988
Yeah. I mean, I guess that makes sense.

00:43:40.451 --> 00:43:42.545
- Hello?
- Hey. Is this Molly?

00:43:42.995 --> 00:43:44.121
Speaking.

00:43:44.205 --> 00:43:45.673
Hey. It's Schmidt.

00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:49.552
It's Doug Schmug McQuaid.

00:43:49.752 --> 00:43:51.925
Hey, man.

00:43:52.004 --> 00:43:53.972
It's so weird that you're calling me.

00:43:54.048 --> 00:43:58.178
I pretty much text
except for when a random old relative calls.

00:43:58.553 --> 00:44:02.057
I was just calling 'cause we're costarring
in this play together,

00:44:02.140 --> 00:44:03.232
<i>-and.</i> . .
<i>- Hello ?</i>

00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:04.521
Mom, get off the phone!

00:44:04.892 --> 00:44:06.644
<i>Sorry, Do!-IQ,</i>

00:44:06.727 --> 00:44:08.400
<i>-my teen son.
- Mom!</i>

00:44:08.563 --> 00:44:10.861
<i>I love you, honey, Dougie,
Doug, Douglas McQuaid.</i>

00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:12.783
Mom, so serious right now! Stop!

00:44:16.737 --> 00:44:19.456
<i>I'm sorry. My mom's such a dick.</i>

00:44:19.574 --> 00:44:23.624
She just, like, smothers me with affection
and makes me feel like I'm five years old.

00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:26.957
Wow. You're a sharer. I dig that.

00:44:27.248 --> 00:44:30.468
<i>Well, I'm 18 years old, and my mom
still packs a lunch for me every day.</i>

00:44:30.585 --> 00:44:33.805
There was this one month
where she bought me 43 stuffed animals.

00:44:34.088 --> 00:44:36.682
<i>The doctor thought
I was gonna spontaneously grow a vagina.</i>

00:44:37.216 --> 00:44:38.718
I didn't, though, just to be clear.

00:44:39.427 --> 00:44:40.599
Yeah, because you already had one.

00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:42.183
Exactly. I already had one.

00:44:42.263 --> 00:44:44.015
And you don't need two vaginae.
You just don't.

00:44:44.098 --> 00:44:46.100
<i>Although you could use one as a coin purse.</i>

00:44:47.059 --> 00:44:48.686
I never got any stuffed animals growing up.

00:44:48.769 --> 00:44:51.022
Wait, actually, that's not true. I did.

00:44:51.105 --> 00:44:52.948
My dad gave me a stuffed puppy
the day he bailed on us.

00:44:55.026 --> 00:44:56.403
I'm just fucking with you.

00:44:56.944 --> 00:44:58.491
That is a weird joke.

00:44:58.613 --> 00:45:00.206
I thought your dad abandoned your family.

00:45:00.281 --> 00:45:01.874
No, he did walk out on us, though.

00:45:02.491 --> 00:45:04.869
But he didn't even leave me a stuffed puppy.

00:45:04.952 --> 00:45:06.044
Just broken dreams.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.465
Oh, man. Well, I guess, to that, I would say

00:45:09.624 --> 00:45:10.625
well,

00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:14.129
that there are some good guys out there,

00:45:14.212 --> 00:45:17.807
and I wouldn't let, you know, one experience

00:45:17.882 --> 00:45:20.226
taint your memory.

00:45:20.468 --> 00:45:21.811
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

00:45:21.886 --> 00:45:24.730
Are you getting choked up?
I'm sorry if I made you upset.

00:45:25.056 --> 00:45:28.651
<i>No, it's just, you know,
I don't like when guys are mean to girls.</i>

00:45:28.726 --> 00:45:31.070
Yeah. Well, thanks.

00:45:31.646 --> 00:45:33.569
Normal transition here.

00:45:34.774 --> 00:45:37.903
Actually, I'm having a party next weekend.
You should come!

00:45:37.985 --> 00:45:39.828
You and Eric and Juario, whatever.

00:45:40.112 --> 00:45:43.082
Do you mind if I just put, like,
a posting on Facebook?

00:45:43.157 --> 00:45:45.159
Okay. Yeah, yeah!

00:45:45.826 --> 00:45:46.873
<i>I should call you back.</i>

00:45:46.953 --> 00:45:49.206
Well, all right, I'll see you at school.
You're a great person.

00:45:49.288 --> 00:45:50.255
-5ye-bye. <i>B</i> ye_
- Bye.

00:45:50.331 --> 00:45:51.878
<i>What the fuck are you...</i>

00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:04.061
Are y'all throwing a party?

00:46:05.054 --> 00:46:08.979
- What?
- There's rumors in the Twittersphere.

00:46:09.850 --> 00:46:11.602
And if any of my officers

00:46:11.686 --> 00:46:14.781
are caught giving alcohol to minors,

00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:17.157
they'll find theyself in prison

00:46:18.150 --> 00:46:21.575
with a snorkel duct-taped to they mouth

00:46:21.696 --> 00:46:24.870
and me shitting down that snorkel.

00:46:26.826 --> 00:46:28.703
That's extremely vivid. Thank you.

00:46:29.203 --> 00:46:31.752
You're the best. You are the best.

00:46:32.081 --> 00:46:33.458
- Oh, my God.
- We love you.

00:46:33.541 --> 00:46:34.633
- Enjoy the vineyard.
- You boys be good, now.

00:46:34.709 --> 00:46:37.007
Yeah, I can't believe you guys did this for us.

00:46:37.295 --> 00:46:38.467
Bye!

00:46:38.546 --> 00:46:41.049
"We love you"? What are you doing'?
Why you saying "I love you" to my mom?

00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:42.475
- I'm in character. Shut up.
- It's weird.

00:46:44.051 --> 00:46:46.725
Look, dude, it's kind of like we're brothers.

00:46:47.221 --> 00:46:48.973
Wait, how are we going to buy alcohol?

00:46:49.598 --> 00:46:51.316
Dude, I don't have a fake ID.

00:46:58.899 --> 00:47:00.993
How are we going to get drugs for the party?

00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:03.158
Oh, no.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:10.957
We got a pound of coke.

00:47:11.037 --> 00:47:13.415
We're trying to show them a good time,
not ruin their fucking lives.

00:47:13.497 --> 00:47:14.589
Pound of marijuana?

00:47:15.082 --> 00:47:16.675
- Best party ever.
- Boo-yah!

00:47:31.015 --> 00:47:34.485
To a brilliant idea

00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:36.437
from my brilliant brother

00:47:36.562 --> 00:47:38.564
that I love so very much.

00:47:38.647 --> 00:47:41.275
And this is going to fucking rock.

00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.198
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:51.702
- Who invited you guys?
- I did!

00:47:51.786 --> 00:47:52.787
The party's here!

00:47:53.454 --> 00:47:55.047
- What's up, Zack?
- Hey, buddy.

00:47:55.122 --> 00:47:56.169
What's up, Roman?

00:47:56.248 --> 00:47:59.627
This is crazy. This is, like,
the craziest thing I've ever been a part of.

00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:05.387
Where is Eric, man? He said he'd be here.

00:48:05.466 --> 00:48:07.013
Do we have enough chips?

00:48:07.093 --> 00:48:09.016
Is this playlist too dance-y?

00:48:09.095 --> 00:48:10.221
- Feels too dance-y.
- Too dance-y?

00:48:10.304 --> 00:48:13.729
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know, it just feels dance-y.

00:48:18.312 --> 00:48:19.655
What are you doing?

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:21.858
- That's my mom's Kokopelli vase.
- I got it, I got it.

00:48:21.941 --> 00:48:23.409
Doug, Doug, hey!

00:48:23.484 --> 00:48:26.658
<i>Hey, Paul Blart: Molly Cop.</i>

00:48:27.655 --> 00:48:28.872
Such a bad joke.

00:48:28.948 --> 00:48:30.074
Terrible, terrible.

00:48:30.157 --> 00:48:31.329
- You guys know each other, right?
- Yeah.

00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.249
Get ready, get ready, there's Eric.
Wait for the signal.

00:48:34.328 --> 00:48:36.251
And then you come in here
looking like a rock-solid 10.

00:48:36.330 --> 00:48:37.456
What?

00:48:38.207 --> 00:48:39.424
What's up, man, how you doing?

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:41.297
Eco Suave.

00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:42.837
Whoa.

00:48:43.295 --> 00:48:46.094
Wow, so I'm really digging this decor.

00:48:46.424 --> 00:48:48.347
Very Native American.

00:48:48.884 --> 00:48:50.227
Yeah, our parents are actually

00:48:50.302 --> 00:48:52.771
-really into Native American...
- Let's rock and roll.

00:48:54.515 --> 00:48:56.062
- Sorry.
- What are y'all doing?

00:48:56.517 --> 00:48:58.235
- Come on.
- Did you guys even see Eric?

00:48:58.519 --> 00:49:00.362
Seriously, did you not see Eric?

00:49:00.896 --> 00:49:02.614
No offense, man, but your brother sucks.

00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:05.443
Yo, this is butt.
There's, like, no hot dudes here.

00:49:05.526 --> 00:49:07.278
- Man, let's bounce.
- We're out of here, man.

00:49:07.361 --> 00:49:10.205
No, no, no, come on, you guys just got here
you just got here.

00:49:10.281 --> 00:49:12.454
Come on, let me at least give you a tour.

00:49:12.533 --> 00:49:14.911
Okay, boys, come on, we did it,
we can do this, just go,

00:49:14.994 --> 00:49:16.541
just go as fast as you possibly can.

00:49:16.662 --> 00:49:20.257
Taking out the SIM card.

00:49:20.332 --> 00:49:22.300
<i>Taking down Eric
with the SIM card information</i>

00:49:22.376 --> 00:49:24.128
Come on, CSI the shit out of this thing.

00:49:24.211 --> 00:49:25.838
- Are you drunk?
- No.

00:49:25.921 --> 00:49:27.298
Have you even been drunk before?

00:49:27.381 --> 00:49:28.928
- No, but...
- Give me this.

00:49:29.008 --> 00:49:30.635
- What?
- Can we get some bitches up in here?

00:49:30.718 --> 00:49:32.516
'Cause it's just boys right now.

00:49:32.595 --> 00:49:34.313
No, you can't get any bitches up here.

00:49:34.597 --> 00:49:36.099
This is my parents' bedroom.

00:49:38.225 --> 00:49:39.522
- What the fuck, bro? Some privacy!
- Shit, shit, shit!

00:49:39.602 --> 00:49:42.025
And that is a really gross three-way.

00:49:43.564 --> 00:49:45.111
But what was the girl in the back doing?

00:49:45.191 --> 00:49:47.193
Warehouse rave in Ellsworth.

00:49:47.276 --> 00:49:49.028
Cool, yeah.

00:49:49.111 --> 00:49:51.113
Hey, man, thank you for the hospitality,

00:49:51.197 --> 00:49:53.291
but we got to get going.
You know how it is, yeah?

00:49:53.365 --> 00:49:54.992
Dude, tell me about it.

00:49:56.118 --> 00:49:57.620
Is it ready? He's gonna leave right now.

00:49:57.745 --> 00:49:59.167
It's extracting right now.

00:49:59.246 --> 00:50:01.169
Dude, it's now or never! Is it ready or not?

00:50:01.248 --> 00:50:03.000
Read this.
"Please wait. Extracting data from SIM card."

00:50:03.083 --> 00:50:05.256
Shit! It's a bust.

00:50:09.423 --> 00:50:10.640
- Keep it casual.
- Yeah.

00:50:10.758 --> 00:50:11.725
- Go with the flow, dude.
- Cool, man.

00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:13.177
- I don't like to make plans or whatever.
- You got it.

00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.352
- Thank you again, though, man.
- All right.

00:50:14.428 --> 00:50:17.853
Eric, Eric, Eric. Hey, man, what's up?

00:50:18.432 --> 00:50:20.025
Hey, why you here, Scott?

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.523
What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?

00:50:22.603 --> 00:50:24.605
No, I heard you guys were partying
with some new stuff.

00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:27.199
Wanted to know your hookup
so me and my boys can get in on it.

00:50:27.274 --> 00:50:29.197
Got other commitments on that front,
so, you know...

00:50:29.276 --> 00:50:30.368
I wasn't asking.

00:50:31.904 --> 00:50:33.281
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:50:33.572 --> 00:50:36.041
Take five, take five, man, let me get this.
I got this.

00:50:36.116 --> 00:50:38.460
- Yeah? You sure?
- I got this one.

00:50:39.370 --> 00:50:41.372
Hey, big player, I don't know who you are.

00:50:41.455 --> 00:50:43.378
- Don't worry about who I am.
- I'm worried about it.

00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:45.459
- Why?
-'Cause you're at my party right now, dude.

00:50:45.584 --> 00:50:47.962
This is my temple,
this is where I come to find peace, dawg,

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:50.889
and you're coming in here
like an emotional bull in a china shop,

00:50:50.965 --> 00:50:53.468
metaphorically knocking over vases,
messing with my crew,

00:50:53.551 --> 00:50:57.647
and I'm like, "What, Scott, what, Scott,
what, what, what, what, Scott?"

00:50:57.721 --> 00:50:59.098
- It's that kind of party?
- Yeah, dude.

00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:01.149
Matter of fact, it's getting hot in here, huh?

00:51:01.225 --> 00:51:03.227
- No, it's getting real.
- It's getting very real.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:06.109
Yeah. It's like seven strangers
living in one house. True story.

00:51:06.188 --> 00:51:07.565
- You want <i>Real</i> World?
- Yeah, let's do it, man.

00:51:07.648 --> 00:51:09.241
- Come on. What's your Real...
- Here's Real World.

00:51:09.942 --> 00:51:11.239
What was that? Did you hear that?

00:51:11.318 --> 00:51:12.786
Real enough for you?

00:51:12.861 --> 00:51:14.329
Schmidt. Doug.

00:51:14.405 --> 00:51:15.998
- What do I do?
- Hit him!

00:51:17.992 --> 00:51:19.539
Shit! That hurt worse than when he hit me!

00:51:26.250 --> 00:51:27.467
Fight normal.

00:51:27.543 --> 00:51:28.965
Yo, I'm serious.

00:51:29.044 --> 00:51:30.170
Sorry.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:36.894
- I'll fucking kill you!
- I'm sorry! I'm very sorry!

00:51:38.095 --> 00:51:41.269
Seriously, use your words, use your words!

00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:45.065
I kicked him in the nuts.

00:51:50.524 --> 00:51:52.868
Fight's over, dude! Fight's over! Fight's over!

00:51:57.281 --> 00:51:58.453
No, watch my mom's shit, man!

00:51:58.532 --> 00:52:00.409
- I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- You'll knock over my mom's vase!

00:52:00.492 --> 00:52:02.540
- Fuck your mom's vase!
- Fuck this!

00:52:07.791 --> 00:52:08.883
Oh, shit!

00:52:09.627 --> 00:52:10.924
Yeah!

00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:16.842
That's my brother!

00:52:21.889 --> 00:52:24.267
- That was insane!
- You're so cool!

00:52:25.726 --> 00:52:28.229
Did you see that shit? That was crazy.

00:52:32.650 --> 00:52:33.742
Oh, shit.

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:35.737
When did I get stabbed?

00:52:37.279 --> 00:52:38.451
That's awesome.

00:52:40.574 --> 00:52:41.575
Yeah!

00:52:44.953 --> 00:52:46.580
Is that a cop?

00:52:46.664 --> 00:52:47.916
Where?

00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.259
No, it's not. Here.

00:52:50.918 --> 00:52:53.012
I'm so glad we're going back
to get my phone.

00:52:53.087 --> 00:52:54.930
I just hope we don't wake up Schmidty.

00:52:55.047 --> 00:52:56.424
Oh, my God, he's a policeman now.

00:52:56.507 --> 00:52:58.601
It's like we're living with a narc.

00:52:59.301 --> 00:53:00.644
The boy is an angel.

00:53:01.178 --> 00:53:02.304
Pull it out!

00:53:02.638 --> 00:53:06.359
Pull it out! Pull it out! Pull it out!

00:53:06.433 --> 00:53:07.559
Sorry!

00:53:17.569 --> 00:53:18.821
Okay, let's take some shots.

00:53:18.904 --> 00:53:20.281
Shots, shots!

00:53:25.452 --> 00:53:27.750
That's like us fucking Mother Earth
without a condom.

00:54:04.575 --> 00:54:06.202
What the fuck is going on?

00:54:06.326 --> 00:54:08.169
Annie, hang on.

00:54:11.165 --> 00:54:12.883
Are you fucking kidding me?

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.924
Get out of my house. I said get out!
The party's over!

00:54:16.003 --> 00:54:17.471
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry!

00:54:17.755 --> 00:54:19.348
The mom is coming!

00:54:19.631 --> 00:54:21.508
- Listen to me!
- Chill out! Chill out!

00:54:22.009 --> 00:54:23.306
- Let go of me!
- You're embarrassing me

00:54:23.385 --> 00:54:25.353
-in front of my friends!
- Get back here, you shit!

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:30.483
Dude, that was so crazy, man.

00:54:30.559 --> 00:54:32.778
I swear, best party I've been to in years.

00:54:32.853 --> 00:54:34.480
Dude, I'm doing crazy stuff like that,

00:54:34.563 --> 00:54:36.236
-like, all the time, man.
- I bet you are.

00:54:36.356 --> 00:54:38.779
Dude, I'm so amped right now, God!

00:54:40.235 --> 00:54:41.828
You, dude, I like you, man.

00:54:41.904 --> 00:54:43.497
How do you feel about making
a little extra money?

00:54:43.614 --> 00:54:45.662
Whatever it is, I'm in.

00:54:45.741 --> 00:54:46.993
All right, here's the deal.

00:54:47.075 --> 00:54:51.000
Okay, I can't sell all this shit on my own,
but I only bring in people I like.

00:54:51.705 --> 00:54:54.049
Okay, you do good,
maybe we bring you in on what we're doing,

00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:56.214
I introduce you to my hookup.
How's that sound?

00:54:57.169 --> 00:54:58.466
- Cool with me.
- My man.

00:54:58.545 --> 00:55:00.422
That is my man...

00:55:00.756 --> 00:55:02.383
That was nuts. I lost you guys.

00:55:04.968 --> 00:55:07.187
Hey, thank you again for the party, man.

00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:08.639
Yo, yo.

00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:14.236
Come on!

00:55:16.897 --> 00:55:18.319
"I love dick"?

00:55:18.398 --> 00:55:19.900
You think that's funny?

00:55:19.983 --> 00:55:21.485
<i>"Wonder Years douche"?</i>

00:55:21.568 --> 00:55:23.787
What kind of a sick animal draws

00:55:23.862 --> 00:55:27.332
an ejaculating penis
into an 8-year-old's mouth?

00:55:27.407 --> 00:55:30.456
It's arguably, like, an airplane throwing up.

00:55:31.245 --> 00:55:32.918
You think I don't know
that's a dick and balls?

00:55:33.038 --> 00:55:34.915
I know all about dick and balls!

00:55:34.998 --> 00:55:37.376
I partied with Robert Downey Jr.
before he got sober,

00:55:37.459 --> 00:55:39.712
when he was really fucked up
and a lot of fun!

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.843
You know what?
From now on, you're gonna do some chores.

00:55:41.922 --> 00:55:44.220
You're gonna wash the laundry,
you're gonna fold it,

00:55:44.299 --> 00:55:47.929
you're gonna do the dishes,
you're gonna mow the lawn...

00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.273
Dude, I have a surprise for you.

00:55:55.352 --> 00:55:57.150
Last night at the party, I took Eric's phone

00:55:57.271 --> 00:55:59.945
and I had Zack put
this monitoring device in it,

00:56:00.065 --> 00:56:03.194
so we're gonna get to hear every single thing
that little prick is up to.

00:56:03.443 --> 00:56:05.195
Dude, I don't know if that was a good idea.

00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:06.246
What?

00:56:06.321 --> 00:56:08.289
- What if you had gotten found out?
- But it worked.

00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:10.242
This is, like,
the smartest move I've ever pulled,

00:56:10.325 --> 00:56:12.953
so, I'm sorry,
what are you getting mad at me for?

00:56:13.036 --> 00:56:15.960
I'm not getting mad at you.
I'm glad you have something to do.

00:56:18.458 --> 00:56:19.505
Good.

00:56:22.713 --> 00:56:24.056
What's up?

00:56:29.845 --> 00:56:31.062
Great job, Schmidt

00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:49.039
- Password!
- Kneel before Zod!

00:56:49.114 --> 00:56:50.411
You may enter.

00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:52.083
Thank you, Zod.

00:57:00.167 --> 00:57:01.293
Let's tap that wire, huh?

00:57:01.376 --> 00:57:03.128
We were just about to go outside
with a bunch of chemicals.

00:57:03.211 --> 00:57:05.009
We were going to test what blows up.

00:57:05.505 --> 00:57:08.349
There's no reason the wiretap
is super urgent, right'?

00:57:09.509 --> 00:57:11.637
Not that I can think of
that would make sense.

00:57:11.845 --> 00:57:13.643
Go for it, go for it.

00:57:13.722 --> 00:57:15.520
- Look out.
- Go, go, go!

00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:19.561
Yes!

00:57:19.937 --> 00:57:21.860
Yes, that's what I'm talking about!

00:57:21.939 --> 00:57:23.361
That's what I'm talking about!

00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:24.908
I love this science shit!

00:57:24.983 --> 00:57:27.406
This is what you guys do all day?
Let's do it again.

00:57:43.919 --> 00:57:45.262
Are you texting Molly?

00:57:45.712 --> 00:57:46.759
What?

00:57:47.214 --> 00:57:48.682
I don't... Molly...

00:57:49.341 --> 00:57:50.638
Maybe. Is that...

00:57:50.717 --> 00:57:53.345
Whoa, it's cool, man, come on.

00:57:53.428 --> 00:57:56.602
I'm not some, like,
'50s letterman who pins a girl.

00:57:56.682 --> 00:57:59.310
I mean, yeah, we blow each other sometimes,
but it's not a thing.

00:57:59.393 --> 00:58:02.522
I just, like... I don't know,
I don't believe in possessions, ja feel?

00:58:03.271 --> 00:58:05.399
Ja feel, ja definitely feel.

00:58:05.691 --> 00:58:07.489
- Yeah.
- Schmidty?

00:58:09.069 --> 00:58:10.241
Schmidty.

00:58:11.405 --> 00:58:12.406
Phyllis.

00:58:13.699 --> 00:58:15.076
- I'll be right back, dude.
- Okay.

00:58:17.035 --> 00:58:19.379
Hey. How are you?

00:58:19.454 --> 00:58:21.673
- How is my favorite police officer?
- Okay.

00:58:21.748 --> 00:58:24.297
Your mother told me that you are undercover.

00:58:24.376 --> 00:58:25.878
Listen, now is not a really good time.

00:58:26.211 --> 00:58:27.929
Are you undercover right now?

00:58:28.005 --> 00:58:29.473
Yes, it means I'm undercover right now.

00:58:29.548 --> 00:58:31.266
Are those the bad guys over there?

00:58:31.341 --> 00:58:34.185
Do they have guns? Oh, my God.
Oh, God, this is so exciting.

00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:36.104
I have got to call Annie. She is gonna die.

00:58:36.221 --> 00:58:39.100
I heard that that Jenko boy is your partner.

00:58:39.182 --> 00:58:40.809
- Where is my phone?
- Okay, okay.

00:58:40.892 --> 00:58:42.189
Shut your fucking mouth.

00:58:42.269 --> 00:58:44.397
Shut your fucking mouth,
you understand me?

00:58:44.479 --> 00:58:46.322
Let's go check this out.

00:58:46.398 --> 00:58:48.526
I will straight-up punch you in the face
if you do not shut up.

00:58:48.608 --> 00:58:50.702
- There is no...
- A straight-up face punch.

00:58:50.777 --> 00:58:51.903
I swear to God, you're gonna get me killed.

00:58:51.987 --> 00:58:53.409
- Hey, yo.
- That is...

00:58:55.323 --> 00:58:57.121
Shit! She just tried to grab my dick, dude!

00:58:57.200 --> 00:58:59.419
- What? You tried to grab his...
- She tried to grab myjunk.

00:58:59.494 --> 00:59:01.041
She was like, "Oh, my God, I have arthritis,

00:59:01.121 --> 00:59:02.794
"it hurts my hand,
I need to grab a handful of that dick."

00:59:02.873 --> 00:59:03.999
I was like, "Get the fuck off me!"

00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:05.459
She said, "I need to grab
a handful of that dick"?

00:59:05.542 --> 00:59:07.169
And it felt good,
but then it felt weird for a second,

00:59:07.252 --> 00:59:09.346
so I pushed her. We got to get out of here.

00:59:09.421 --> 00:59:10.422
All right, cool, let's get the...

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:30.530
So your parents are just cool
with having people over whenever?

00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:32.368
Yeah, you know, they're out most nights.

00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:34.159
Pretty laissez-faire about the whole thing.

00:59:34.696 --> 00:59:36.949
You're so lucky your parents
don't give a shit about you.

00:59:37.032 --> 00:59:38.249
Right?

00:59:38.325 --> 00:59:40.168
- This place is awesome.
- Yeah.

00:59:40.327 --> 00:59:41.453
Hey.

00:59:41.912 --> 00:59:42.913
Hey, what's up?

00:59:42.996 --> 00:59:44.464
How's it going?

00:59:44.539 --> 00:59:47.463
Wow, that's a bigger hug
than I was expecting.

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:49.628
Sorry. I'm happy to see you.

00:59:49.711 --> 00:59:51.304
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

00:59:51.379 --> 00:59:52.972
- H6Y-
- HeY-

00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:56.392
Good?

00:59:56.676 --> 00:59:58.019
- All right, come on.
- Yeah, let's...

00:59:58.095 --> 01:00:00.348
I brought tacos, so that's cool.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:03.271
<i>Try to turn it, try to turn it, spoiler alert</i>

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.024
<i>Spoiler alert, spoiler alert!</i>

01:00:06.186 --> 01:00:10.942
Hey, boys, this eco-pussy
is going down today.

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:13.698
<i>Take down eco-pussy</i>

01:00:13.777 --> 01:00:16.530
<i>Take down eco-pussy!</i>

01:00:16.988 --> 01:00:21.038
<i>Mother Earth, Mother Earth is dying</i>

01:00:21.743 --> 01:00:23.916
<i>And when it rains</i>

01:00:23.995 --> 01:00:25.872
<i>It means that beautiful bitch is crying</i>

01:00:26.081 --> 01:00:27.924
- It's really not a planet.
- It's for sure a planet.

01:00:28.375 --> 01:00:29.797
Pluto is a planet.

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:30.923
- It's ready!
- It used to be a planet.

01:00:31.002 --> 01:00:32.049
- It's ready.
- Not any more.

01:00:32.129 --> 01:00:35.303
<i>Reduce, reuse</i>

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:37.555
<i>Recycle</i>

01:00:37.634 --> 01:00:38.760
I'm embarrassed.

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:41.222
- I always feel exposed after playing.
- Do not feel exposed.

01:00:41.346 --> 01:00:42.393
I got to use the bathroom.

01:00:42.514 --> 01:00:44.391
- Is it in there?
- Yeah, yeah, right up there, dude.

01:00:44.474 --> 01:00:46.476
All right, all right, all right, all right.
God damn that.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.029
The mic is live and we can
hear how the other half lives.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:05.499
What are you doing?

01:01:05.579 --> 01:01:07.126
I heard something.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:09.333
<i>Hey, can I ask you something? Sit down.</i>

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:10.588
<i>Okay.</i>

01:01:11.168 --> 01:01:14.172
I just want to make sure
that you and Eric are going to be careful

01:01:14.254 --> 01:01:17.884
with whatever it is
that you're getting involved in.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:20.932
Yeah, I promise we will.

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:23.389
It would just suck
if something bad happened,

01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.563
because you're a good guy.

01:01:26.766 --> 01:01:29.861
Yeah, no, I feel the same way about you,

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:31.779
except girl version.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:33.607
You're a girl.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:35.446
- I am.
- Yeah.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:37.528
That's why I put this dress on,

01:01:37.611 --> 01:01:39.033
-to remind you.
- Exactly.

01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:42.116
- Are you excited about the play?
- Yes.

01:01:42.199 --> 01:01:43.291
Yeah, you were just

01:01:43.366 --> 01:01:44.413
-right in there with excitement.
- Yes.

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:45.869
- No hesitash.
- I'm very excited.

01:01:45.952 --> 01:01:47.499
Yeah.

01:01:47.621 --> 01:01:49.214
Does that make me a super nerd?

01:01:49.289 --> 01:01:50.916
No, not at all.

01:01:51.124 --> 01:01:52.421
<i>We get to act together:</i>

01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.379
What a vagina. He has no chance with her.

01:01:55.462 --> 01:01:56.554
So...

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:57.882
- Shit.
- Sorry.

01:01:57.964 --> 01:01:59.762
You're on the prom committee.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:01.343
Do you think it's going to be fun?

01:02:01.593 --> 01:02:02.765
Did shejust bring up prom on her own?

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:04.642
- She did, she just brought up prom.
- What is she doing?

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:06.348
I think it's going to be awesome.

01:02:06.514 --> 01:02:07.857
- Prom eats a dong.
- Multiple dongs.

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:09.025
All right, anyone who says

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:11.899
they don't care about prom
actually secretly does.

01:02:11.978 --> 01:02:14.072
Who we gonna take to the prom?
No one's going to prom with us.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:17.401
Come on, picture it.
You pull up in a white stallion of a limo.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:19.111
You got fine-ass honeys with you.

01:02:19.194 --> 01:02:21.367
You're dressed to the nines
with your best buds.

01:02:21.446 --> 01:02:23.448
Doves fly out behind you, slow motion.

01:02:23.531 --> 01:02:25.249
Doves. Why doves?

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.954
'Cause doves make you look
like a badass, that's why.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:30.755
I am pretty skeptical,

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:36.004
but maybe, if someone fun asked me,
I would go.

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:40.090
Aren't... Isn't... Aren't you and Eric...

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:41.766
Wouldn't you and Eric go together?

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:44.724
Not that I know of.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:54.187
Would you...

01:02:54.271 --> 01:02:55.318
He's going to choke.

01:02:55.522 --> 01:02:58.071
He always chokes.
He's going to choke, wait for it.

01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:01.449
So would...

01:03:01.695 --> 01:03:03.242
So would...

01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:05.991
Would you...

01:03:07.701 --> 01:03:08.953
Mayb...

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:12.247
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:03:12.455 --> 01:03:15.425
That is the actual sound of choking.

01:03:16.293 --> 01:03:19.388
I was wondering if you...

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:22.265
Would you

01:03:23.883 --> 01:03:25.556
maybe want to go

01:03:27.554 --> 01:03:28.680
with me to prom?

01:03:28.763 --> 01:03:30.891
Would you want to go to me...
Maybe with me to prom?

01:03:31.516 --> 01:03:32.563
Yes.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:35.695
I would love to go to prom with you.

01:03:36.396 --> 01:03:38.490
What? She just said yes!

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:40.033
- Whoa.
- Wow.

01:03:40.191 --> 01:03:42.193
Good for you, Doug.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:44.404
Thank you for asking.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:53.751
Put her there, man.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:55.753
Just put... Put it right there.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:59.341
I'm putting it right there.

01:03:59.627 --> 01:04:01.345
<i>Yeah. There you guys are.</i>

01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:02.968
<i>What's up, my man?</i>

01:04:03.048 --> 01:04:04.049
- Hi.
- How you doing?

01:04:04.132 --> 01:04:05.805
- Whazzup?
- Yeah.

01:04:06.384 --> 01:04:09.228
Doug... Okay, settle an argument.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:11.064
You and your brother aren't related, right?

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:12.356
'Cause you look totally different.

01:04:12.432 --> 01:04:13.775
He's adopted.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:16.103
<i>We all suspect from a very lame family.</i>

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:18.814
<i>Where is he tonight?</i>

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:22.693
<i>Probably at home with those lame tools
he hangs out with. I don't know.</i>

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:25.370
You know how Tom Cruise is
always pissed off at Rain Man?

01:04:25.445 --> 01:04:28.995
That's like my life,
except Brad is really shitty at math.

01:04:31.451 --> 01:04:32.919
Your brother's kind of a dick.

01:04:32.994 --> 01:04:34.541
Well, yeah.

01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:37.458
He kind of is, isn't he?

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:38.799
Don't listen to that.

01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:40.877
I don't give a fuck.

01:04:46.966 --> 01:04:49.389
Dude, Eric is the funniest IM-er.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:57.689
Oh, fuck.

01:04:59.479 --> 01:05:01.823
Hey, guys. It's so funny seeing you here.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.571
How are you? Guess what, I don't care.

01:05:03.650 --> 01:05:06.119
We just closed our third
high school operation.

01:05:06.194 --> 01:05:08.117
And check what we found at Kennedy.

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.790
Looks like we're going to have to do
your job for you.

01:05:10.865 --> 01:05:14.165
Your drugs is spreading
to different schools now, sucker.

01:05:16.413 --> 01:05:20.384
You failed to stop the outbreak,
and you have no leads!

01:05:20.667 --> 01:05:22.510
We are running out of time!

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.337
You either find the supplier,

01:05:24.421 --> 01:05:26.924
or I'm gonna jump your <i>asses</i>
off Jump Street!

01:05:27.006 --> 01:05:28.974
I totally understand
where you're coming from, sir,

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.473
but, look, I heard Eric
talking on the phone yesterday

01:05:31.553 --> 01:05:33.726
with somebody that sounded very suspect

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:35.978
about meeting up with a stuffed pifiata.

01:05:37.600 --> 01:05:39.728
Is that a code for sex?

01:05:42.397 --> 01:05:44.274
- Pifiata? Really?
- Yep.

01:05:44.566 --> 01:05:46.239
Remember that wiretap
I put on Eric's phone?

01:05:46.359 --> 01:05:49.033
While you were having the time of your life
last night, I was listening.

01:05:49.154 --> 01:05:51.953
I overheard a phone call between Eric
and some dude about a pifiata.

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:55.201
That's all you heard?

01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.877
Yep.

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:02.050
<i>I am so nervous.</i>

01:06:02.167 --> 01:06:05.216
We are about to premiere
in front of the whole school.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.764
I apologize in advance
if I throw up on you onstage.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:09.974
Serious question, though.

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.260
How do I look?

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:14.266
Ravishing.

01:06:14.387 --> 01:06:16.810
Is it too sexy of an outfit?

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:18.187
Bend the knee a little bit.

01:06:18.266 --> 01:06:19.643
Yep, it is.

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:25.069
It's going to be so much easier
having you onstage with me.

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.650
I am so happy that I met you.

01:06:26.733 --> 01:06:30.033
You're, like, the only guy
that I can really trust.

01:06:30.111 --> 01:06:32.580
Yep. That's me.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:34.498
Doug.

01:06:39.913 --> 01:06:41.586
Potassium nitrate.

01:06:42.457 --> 01:06:45.461
Don't hate. It's great.

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:47.341
It can act as an oxidizer.

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:49.263
I didn't know that, but now I'm wiser.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:53.055
It has a crystalline structure.

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:55.933
If you can't respect that,
you're a butt muncher.

01:06:56.596 --> 01:06:58.894
It's a key ingredient in gunpowder.

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:02.018
K-NO-three, don't give no grief.

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:05.318
It can be used to make corned beef.

01:07:07.106 --> 01:07:09.154
It's also known <i>as</i> saltpeter.

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:16.282
- Brad?
- Shit.

01:07:16.366 --> 01:07:18.039
Where are you going?

01:07:18.117 --> 01:07:20.290
I don't want to look like
it's like I'm wearing makeup.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:22.088
- Right.
- Doug! Hi.

01:07:22.163 --> 01:07:23.540
Brad!

01:07:23.623 --> 01:07:24.840
Whoa. What are you wearing?

01:07:24.916 --> 01:07:26.509
Potassium nitrate. Thanks for noticing.

01:07:26.751 --> 01:07:27.798
I need to borrow you.

01:07:27.877 --> 01:07:29.550
Now's not a good time, Brad.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:31.381
It's a really good time.

01:07:31.965 --> 01:07:35.640
'Cause my pifiata is killing me.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:37.728
Is that code for a sex thing?

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:39.431
It's leaving the parking lot.

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:40.686
Pifiata?

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.773
Molly.

01:07:44.852 --> 01:07:46.820
I will be right back.
I need to help Brad with something, okay?

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.489
I just need to help Brad
with something real quick.

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:49.691
- What? No. What?
- I promise you...

01:07:49.774 --> 01:07:51.526
Do you understand how soon
the show is starting?

01:07:51.609 --> 01:07:53.202
I swear to you
I will be back in time for curtain.

01:07:53.278 --> 01:07:55.121
- I swear. I swear to you.
- Tell me you understand how soon...

01:07:55.196 --> 01:07:57.164
What? Are you kidding me?

01:07:59.325 --> 01:08:00.918
What did I say? What did I say?

01:08:00.994 --> 01:08:03.873
See? Whose wiretap is
working for him now, huh?

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:14.762
Shit.

01:08:15.008 --> 01:08:16.180
Fuck!

01:08:16.676 --> 01:08:18.644
You told me not to worry about the tickets!

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:20.893
I thought they made us look cool.

01:08:20.972 --> 01:08:23.100
- Cones, cones...
- Driver's ed car.

01:08:23.182 --> 01:08:24.229
- I'm driving.
- No, you're not.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:27.229
- I never get to drive. I'm driving this time.
- Fine! Drive!

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.276
- Hey, guys.
- Just borrowing this for one sec.

01:08:29.355 --> 01:08:31.449
- Sure.
- Go. Go, go, go, go.

01:08:32.025 --> 01:08:33.618
Guys, hey, wait. Guys, you're not on the list.

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.991
Hey, guys, wait! Who cares?

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:53.762
- Holy fucking shit.
- No fucking way.

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:55.723
Those are the guys from the park.

01:08:55.798 --> 01:08:57.095
That's just too crazy.

01:08:58.384 --> 01:09:00.478
What do you think's in that thing?

01:09:00.553 --> 01:09:02.226
I don't know, money, drugs.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:04.774
They could be a new buyer,
or they could be the supplier.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:06.726
If it's good, you'll hear from me.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:10.313
If it's not good, you'll hear from me
about telling you how it's not good.

01:09:10.396 --> 01:09:11.488
Makes sense.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:13.987
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Yeah, no worries, man.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.740
I'll see you guys.

01:09:15.818 --> 01:09:18.071
We definitely got to follow
them and find out, though.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:22.496
- Get down! Get down!
- Get down! Get down!

01:09:26.037 --> 01:09:27.209
- What are you doing?
- If they see us,

01:09:27.288 --> 01:09:28.540
just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

01:09:28.623 --> 01:09:30.125
- What? No!
- Yes. Stop.

01:09:30.208 --> 01:09:31.801
You pretend like you're sucking my dick.

01:09:31.918 --> 01:09:33.511
No, just pretend like you're sucking my dick.

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.929
Why am I automatically blowing you?

01:09:35.004 --> 01:09:37.132
'Cause you're in
a fucking Peter Pan costume!

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:38.307
Okay.

01:09:44.430 --> 01:09:45.522
Okay, let's go. Let's go, let's go.

01:09:45.598 --> 01:09:47.066
- Go, go, go.
- Okay, fine, we'll follow them.

01:09:47.141 --> 01:09:49.109
But we need to be back in
30 minutes for curtain.

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:56.530
Dude, did you just hit the teacher brake?

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:57.656
Yeah, you're following too close, dude.

01:09:57.777 --> 01:09:59.450
- They're going to make us.
- Well, if I go too far back,

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.372
it's going to look even
more suspicious, so just stop.

01:10:01.447 --> 01:10:02.619
God, just let me do my thing.

01:10:02.740 --> 01:10:04.333
I know what I'm doing.

01:10:06.452 --> 01:10:09.080
Seriously, if you do that again,
I'm going to Whac-A-Mole you in the balls.

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:10.210
Just stay back.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:13.168
- I could not be more serious.
- Take your foot off the brake.

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.629
- No. I'm not... No.
- Take your foot off the brake!

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:25.021
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!

01:10:25.096 --> 01:10:26.393
- Look what you did!
- Look what you did!

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:29.396
What the fuck?
You non-driving motherfuckers!

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:31.273
Get the fuck out of the car!

01:10:31.352 --> 01:10:33.946
- Oh, fuck.
- Lock the door! Lock the door!

01:10:34.021 --> 01:10:35.147
What do I do? Go away!

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:36.483
What are you, a fucking Keebler Elf?

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:38.985
Get him out of that car!

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:42.701
- No, no!
- It's fucking ZZ Top!

01:10:42.822 --> 01:10:44.495
- No, no! No, no, no!
- It's fucking ZZ Top!

01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:45.575
Like an angry walrus!

01:10:45.658 --> 01:10:48.252
- I stomp the car now!
- Oh, my God!

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:51.664
- Stomp! Stomp!
- Oh, shit.

01:10:51.789 --> 01:10:54.042
- Okay. Okay.
- Oh, my God! Stop, dude! Go!

01:10:57.503 --> 01:10:59.505
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:11:02.717 --> 01:11:05.095
- Just let me drive!
- Stop hitting me!

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:14.938
Dude, watch out!

01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:18.738
Will you stop front-seat driving?
Get your hands off the wheel!

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.610
Man, you just hit two people back there!

01:11:20.693 --> 01:11:22.695
- You stop. I'm not...
- Take your hands off. Shit!

01:11:27.325 --> 01:11:28.622
- We're stuck in traffic!
- Oh, shit.

01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:30.999
- Shit, they're coming! They're coming!
- What?

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:32.834
Oh, my God, dude.

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:34.006
What do we do?

01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.298
What the... What the...

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:37.172
Oh, Shit. Oh, shit.

01:11:37.251 --> 01:11:38.628
Oh, shit.

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:40.088
- Oh, shit.
- What's wrong with you? Run!

01:11:40.171 --> 01:11:42.048
I can't! I'm wearing tights!

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.509
I got skinny jeans on!
It's the same fucking thing!

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:48.554
They're going to make us, or kill us.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:51.812
- Porsche! Porsche!
- Police! Get out of the car, douche!

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:53.484
I'm on a call here, jackass.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.859
That's right. Go to sleep, bitch.
You just got head-butted, motherfucker!

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:58.190
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.074
Check around for a gun or something,
all right?

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.496
Where? Where?
There's no glove compartment

01:12:05.571 --> 01:12:08.700
in this shitty-ass car!
There's golf balls and this.

01:12:08.783 --> 01:12:10.660
- What am I supposed to do with this?
- I don't know, man!

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:12.370
I've never been in a freeway chase before!

01:12:26.968 --> 01:12:30.017
Watch out! It's going to explode!
It's going to go!

01:12:30.888 --> 01:12:32.686
- What happened?
- I don't know.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:34.017
- It just didn't explode.
- That's weird.

01:12:36.727 --> 01:12:39.401
Can anybody tell me where my Peter is?

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:43.526
French! You're not my first choice,
but I need you to go on as Peter.

01:12:43.609 --> 01:12:45.737
Oh, gosh. And I've been in character
for months now.

01:12:45.820 --> 01:12:47.572
Great. Nobody cares.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:49.957
Come on! Another traffic jam?

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.035
I'm sorry I didn't check the traffic report

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:54.962
-before we got in a car chase!
- Let's go! Come on!

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:58.086
- Come on. Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Shit!

01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.878
- Are you texting?
- No, I'm not texting!

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:04.134
- Yes, you are! You're texting!
- No, I'm not!

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.214
Okay, almost done.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:08.134
<i>IILOL.ll</i>

01:13:10.344 --> 01:13:11.721
I'm driving!

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:13.647
Why do you always jump
over the car like that?

01:13:13.723 --> 01:13:14.940
Hi. Hi. How are you?

01:13:15.016 --> 01:13:16.393
- Hi.
- God damn, you are beautiful.

01:13:16.475 --> 01:13:18.728
- Oh. Hi.
- You are fine as shit.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.108
Don't worry. Someone will pick you up.

01:13:20.187 --> 01:13:22.030
- Wow.
- Hurry. Just drive.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:23.650
Wait. Pick me up?

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.742
- They're coming! They're coming!
- I got an idea.

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:30.994
Why don't you text them
and ask them to stop chasing us?

01:13:36.787 --> 01:13:38.209
Oh, shit!

01:13:40.666 --> 01:13:41.758
He's got a gun!

01:13:41.834 --> 01:13:42.801
I'm going to throw this thing at him!

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:43.969
Okay, you don't have to narrate everything!

01:13:44.045 --> 01:13:45.422
- Just throw it!
- Okay! Okay, okay!

01:14:01.812 --> 01:14:03.439
- It's going to explode!
- Oh, my God! Roll up the windows!

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:04.694
- What the fuck is that going to do?
- Roll it up!

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:05.900
- I don't fucking care! Just do it!
- Oh, God!

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:15.243
I really thought that one
was going to explode.

01:14:21.582 --> 01:14:22.834
Oh, shit!

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:26.637
Look in the glove compartment for a gun.

01:14:26.712 --> 01:14:28.339
What are you talking about?
We're in a pink Bug!

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:31.426
I don't care.
Look in the goddamn glove compartment!

01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:33.011
What the hell?

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.233
- Shoot.
- Oh, my God. Okay! Okay!

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.185
Shoot the gun! Shoot the gun!

01:14:41.268 --> 01:14:43.396
Can't get a good shot, man!
I can't get a good shot!

01:14:43.479 --> 01:14:45.072
- Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
- Take the shot!

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:46.483
Take the shot! Just shoot him! Let's go!

01:14:46.565 --> 01:14:47.908
Shit, shit, Shit, Shit, shit, shit, shit.

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:49.368
- Shoot! Shoot!
- Shit, shit...

01:15:05.543 --> 01:15:07.921
That's what exploded? Holy shit.
That was crazy.

01:15:08.004 --> 01:15:09.426
Why did you shoot for me?

01:15:09.755 --> 01:15:11.177
You weren't shooting, you were choking,

01:15:11.257 --> 01:15:12.759
-so I had to save us.
- I was going to shoot.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:15.227
- You always do this, every single time.
- What?

01:15:15.302 --> 01:15:17.020
Seriously, just take me back to school, man.

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:20.521
If I miss this play, Molly's going to freak out
and she's not going to go to prom with me.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:22.601
- Are you fucking serious right now?
- Fuck, yes, I'm serious!

01:15:26.063 --> 01:15:29.158
Can't believe you made me late.
You're so selfish.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:31.152
- I'm selfish?
- Yes, you're selfish!

01:15:31.277 --> 01:15:32.369
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:15:32.445 --> 01:15:33.867
Look at yourself!

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:36.790
You're in too deep, man.

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:39.664
Yesterday, I found
a college application on your desk!

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:41.958
I don't know how long this case
is going to last.

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:45.629
And Eric's going to get into Berkeley,
and, honestly, I can get in, too.

01:15:45.708 --> 01:15:48.382
Who knows? I could ride this thing out.
I could be a doctor or something.

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:49.804
Have you lost your fucking mind?

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:52.139
You screwed this investigation all up.

01:15:52.715 --> 01:15:54.763
At least I know my Miranda rights, you idiot.

01:16:00.014 --> 01:16:02.312
You are a very silly man indeed.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.519
Boys, squaws, come quickly.

01:16:04.602 --> 01:16:08.106
Hey! Sorry! It's okay. I'm here.

01:16:08.647 --> 01:16:10.365
I know I missed the first few scenes.

01:16:10.441 --> 01:16:12.819
I want to thank...
Give it up to French Samuels

01:16:12.902 --> 01:16:16.247
-for ably backing me up.
- Fuck you, Doug! What?

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:18.324
I say we just roll right into this thing, huh?

01:16:20.951 --> 01:16:22.999
This is my twin. We're together in...

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.337
Get the fuck out of here.

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:28.001
What are you doing?
Have you completely lost your mind?

01:16:28.334 --> 01:16:29.551
What is this?

01:16:29.627 --> 01:16:31.925
I don't know, but it's already more exciting.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:33.472
You're embarrassing me.

01:16:33.547 --> 01:16:34.799
It's okay. I'll make it up to you.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:38.018
And... Let's fly!

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:43.858
- Such bullshit!
- Get off of me!

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:48.441
I'm not dumb! I'm smart!

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:50.489
You think I'm stupid? You're stupid!

01:16:50.564 --> 01:16:53.317
- Go, Doug!
- I guess I should do something.

01:16:53.400 --> 01:16:55.118
I should probably not
just stand here watching.

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:56.571
I should take action.

01:16:56.654 --> 01:16:58.031
Worst best friend ever!

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:04.958
M°IIY, I'm sorry!

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:06.960
I don't want to talk to you ever again.

01:17:07.039 --> 01:17:08.211
I'm sorry.

01:17:14.171 --> 01:17:15.263
You stupid idiot!

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:22.638
- Come here!
- Come on!

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:31.905
Make fun of me behind my back
and everybody laughs at me?

01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:35.322
I was a loser for four years!
You couldn't handle it for five minutes!

01:17:35.401 --> 01:17:37.529
Have some fairy dust, motherfucker!

01:17:40.739 --> 01:17:41.831
Hey, guys, no!

01:17:43.284 --> 01:17:46.254
I heard you call me Rain Man, you asshole!

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:48.547
Principal Dadier sucks dick!

01:17:51.417 --> 01:17:52.885
You're supposed to be my friend!

01:17:52.960 --> 01:17:56.635
Stop! Stop it. You're expelled.
Both of you are expelled.

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:02.018
And that's the end of Act Two.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:24.951
Is that it? You're not going to scream at us?

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:26.790
Nope.

01:18:27.912 --> 01:18:29.505
I'm gonna just fire you.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.468
Moving out?

01:19:20.547 --> 01:19:21.764
Yep.

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:26.437
You know what's crazy to me

01:19:26.971 --> 01:19:29.315
is that I think that I actually
thought that we were brothers.

01:19:31.308 --> 01:19:33.686
I would've tooken a bullet for you.

01:19:40.526 --> 01:19:42.949
Get in now. Both of you.

01:19:43.028 --> 01:19:44.154
Why should I?

01:19:45.155 --> 01:19:46.156
Just get in the car, man.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.626
Get in the fucking car.

01:19:48.701 --> 01:19:50.169
Nope, not until you ask nicely.

01:19:51.996 --> 01:19:53.623
Please get in the car.

01:19:58.419 --> 01:20:00.922
Come on, you guys. Come on. Please. Jesus.

01:20:02.923 --> 01:20:05.142
Some messed up shit went down yesterday.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.140
Yeah, after we made the exchange,

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:10.723
our potential business partners
got followed by some fucking cops.

01:20:10.806 --> 01:20:12.228
That's insane, man.

01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:13.646
Are you serious?

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:15.854
Okay, it's just I don't want to go to jail!

01:20:15.936 --> 01:20:18.314
You know what happens to
a handsome guy like me in jail?

01:20:18.397 --> 01:20:20.149
It rhymes with "grape"!

01:20:20.816 --> 01:20:22.284
It rhymes with "grape."

01:20:23.235 --> 01:20:24.532
I can't let that happen.

01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:25.737
So I got these from my dad's gun cabinet.

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:27.494
- Eric, Eric, Eric, Eric.
- Whoa. Come on. Whoa.

01:20:27.573 --> 01:20:31.373
Springfield .45s, police issue.
Very powerful guns.

01:20:31.994 --> 01:20:33.621
You ever use one?

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:37.007
- We're not really gun people, man. No.
- No?

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:40.377
A lot of things
have made me wonder about you.

01:20:40.461 --> 01:20:41.508
Come on.

01:20:42.046 --> 01:20:44.014
Your taste in music

01:20:44.089 --> 01:20:46.763
The fact that you look
like a fucking 40-year-old man.

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:50.684
Then after that shit at the play, I realized

01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:56.018
there's no way you guys could be cops.

01:20:58.437 --> 01:21:01.031
Yeah, I got this deal going down.
The supplier's going to be there.

01:21:01.106 --> 01:21:03.325
I need people I can trust.

01:21:05.110 --> 01:21:06.578
All right. All right, come on.

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:08.326
Okay, right over here,
we're going to shoot these bottles.

01:21:08.447 --> 01:21:09.790
- We're going to practice, okay?
- Okay.

01:21:20.292 --> 01:21:23.262
That was... That was actually
really fuckin' awesome.

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:24.589
Beginner's luck.

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:26.014
All right.

01:21:26.090 --> 01:21:27.717
The supplier wants the deal
to go down at prom.

01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:29.302
All right, there's going to be
all these heavies there,

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:30.928
but as long as you guys have my back...

01:21:31.011 --> 01:21:32.854
Yeah? Yeah? Shit.

01:21:32.930 --> 01:21:34.682
I always got your back.

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:37.730
Time to get our jobs back.

01:21:40.062 --> 01:21:41.359
Let's get ready for prom.

01:21:56.328 --> 01:21:58.547
Schmidty! Chore time!

01:21:58.664 --> 01:22:00.962
Mom, we don't have time
for chores right now!

01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:04.887
If you stay in this house,
you have time for chores!

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:06.259
Mom!

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:23.822
Fuck this thing.

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:30.575
Here.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.744
It'll be quicker if I help.

01:22:34.908 --> 01:22:36.000
There you go.

01:22:37.578 --> 01:22:38.830
Thanks.

01:22:44.877 --> 01:22:47.096
Your shotgun's hanging too low.

01:22:47.171 --> 01:22:48.798
They're gonna see it.

01:22:52.050 --> 01:22:53.222
Thanks.

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.319
Jenko...

01:23:07.733 --> 01:23:09.861
Will you go to prom with me?

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.374
I guess.

01:23:17.576 --> 01:23:21.206
Are we really going to take down
a whole drug operation by ourselves?

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:26.134
I got some contacts that'll help us.

01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:10.220
Brad, what are you doing here?
You can't be here.

01:24:10.295 --> 01:24:11.387
What if the principal sees you?

01:24:11.463 --> 01:24:13.682
- This is wrong, yet so right.
- What?

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:16.052
I am so happy you're willing
to get in trouble for me.

01:24:16.134 --> 01:24:18.683
You have to go. Please, don't leave me ever.

01:24:18.804 --> 01:24:20.021
Ms. Griggs, stop. Stop.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:21.474
- Stay! Stay.
- Stop.

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:23.225
- What?
- Stay.

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:24.601
- Go!
"Okay

01:24:24.685 --> 01:24:25.937
- Stay.
- Stop. Stop-

01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:27.737
- I'm lost without you.
- What?

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:30.816
Get out of me. I'm going to throw up.

01:24:31.483 --> 01:24:33.110
You are so hot!

01:24:35.028 --> 01:24:36.120
All right.

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:43.249
Hey, pumpkin head.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:45.672
I'm very mad at you. Dance with me.

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.715
- Are you on that shit?
- So what if I am?

01:24:47.833 --> 01:24:50.757
Look, Molly, some serious stuff
is about to go down,

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:53.055
and I don't want you to get hurt.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:55.553
I've already been hurt, Doug. I don't care.

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:59.599
You need to leave. You need to leave.
You need to get out of here right now.

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:01.430
Making a lot of hand gestures!

01:25:03.098 --> 01:25:04.224
Okay, my name's not Doug.

01:25:04.308 --> 01:25:05.605
- It's Schmidt.
- What?

01:25:05.684 --> 01:25:07.277
- And I'm a cop.
- What?

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:11.073
Okay, and I care about you,
and I don't want you to get busted,

01:25:11.148 --> 01:25:13.276
so you have to leave right now.

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:15.031
Leave the prom right now, Molly.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.612
- I'm serious.
- Hey. Hey.

01:25:16.695 --> 01:25:17.992
Penthouse now. Supplier's waiting.

01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:19.288
- What are you?
- Come on. Hey, come on.

01:25:19.364 --> 01:25:20.866
- Supplier's waiting.
- Is that Eric?

01:25:20.949 --> 01:25:22.997
- Molly, leave right now.
- What are you...

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:25.499
- Just leave right now!
- What is this?

01:25:39.718 --> 01:25:40.810
Mr. Walters?

01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:42.679
Hey!

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:45.266
Beautiful Brad, and his brother.

01:25:45.349 --> 01:25:46.692
Wow. You look great.

01:25:46.767 --> 01:25:48.269
You're the supplier? You're a teacher.

01:25:48.352 --> 01:25:49.979
And I was stuck on a teacher's salary, bro.

01:25:50.062 --> 01:25:52.565
Could barely pay my alimony.
What are you gonna do?

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:54.566
Oh, yeah.

01:25:54.691 --> 01:25:56.489
You boys are so good at this.

01:25:56.568 --> 01:25:58.161
Oh, yeah, Cinnamon!

01:25:58.236 --> 01:26:00.830
Oh, my God,
we're getting such good evidence.

01:26:00.906 --> 01:26:02.658
<i>I stole some of that Bunsen burner crap</i>

01:26:02.741 --> 01:26:05.039
from the chem lab,
threw in some of my Cool Deets,

01:26:05.118 --> 01:26:07.086
<i>and it was muy deliciosol</i>

01:26:07.162 --> 01:26:09.415
Then one day I catch
Eco Butt-munch over here

01:26:09.498 --> 01:26:11.250
smoking a J.J. behind the field house,

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:13.210
and I'm like,
"Hey, you want to make some coin?"

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:15.261
What a green penis that guy is, huh?

01:26:17.130 --> 01:26:18.302
There's my quesadilla.

01:26:19.758 --> 01:26:21.431
I hurt my hands!

01:26:22.427 --> 01:26:23.428
Bitch.

01:26:30.769 --> 01:26:31.941
Oh, shit.

01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.364
You guys look crazy scary.

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:35.531
How many of you are there?

01:26:35.816 --> 01:26:36.863
A lot.

01:26:36.942 --> 01:26:38.114
Karl.

01:26:38.610 --> 01:26:39.862
Patch looks pimp, man.

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:41.788
Thank you.

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:44.033
He's gonna recognize us, man.

01:26:44.116 --> 01:26:45.584
I'm freaking out.

01:26:45.659 --> 01:26:47.286
This is Walters, he made the stuff.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:49.872
- Real pleasure to meet you.
- Fuck what his name is.

01:26:49.955 --> 01:26:51.207
Your shit's good.

01:26:51.289 --> 01:26:53.257
Thank you.
That means a lot coming from you.

01:26:53.333 --> 01:26:54.550
What, you having a party now?

01:26:54.626 --> 01:26:56.469
Who are these two motherfuckers?

01:26:56.545 --> 01:26:57.546
Fuck!

01:26:59.339 --> 01:27:01.182
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:04.018
Nah, nah, it's cool, man,
they're my boys, so...

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:05.470
- Are they?
- Yeah.

01:27:05.595 --> 01:27:06.972
I don't like strangers.

01:27:07.264 --> 01:27:09.983
How do you ever expect
to make any new friends with that attitude?

01:27:10.058 --> 01:27:12.902
It's, like, everyone's a stranger
till you give them a chance, man.

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:14.400
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:15.480
I don't even...

01:27:15.564 --> 01:27:17.157
Just fuckin' around.

01:27:17.607 --> 01:27:19.200
Do your thing, man. Proceed

01:27:21.194 --> 01:27:22.491
Hey, kid, come here.

01:27:22.612 --> 01:27:24.660
You, you look familiar.

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:26.662
- Me?
- Yeah.

01:27:27.576 --> 01:27:31.171
I was in a French fry commercial
when I was a kid,

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:33.624
so people are like, you know, often say,
"Oh, I think I know you,"

01:27:33.707 --> 01:27:35.835
but I don't think we've ever met before.

01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:38.136
Do I look like I eat French fries?

01:27:38.211 --> 01:27:40.259
I don't know, you look like
you're in great shape,

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:44.639
but maybe you have, like, one cheat day,
like a carb blowout, you know'? I don't know.

01:27:44.718 --> 01:27:45.890
Nah.

01:27:46.011 --> 01:27:47.388
Yeah, the theme song was, like...

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:52.692
<i>Come to Andrew's French Fry Emporium</i>

01:27:53.310 --> 01:27:56.063
<i>Where friendship and French fries</i>

01:27:56.146 --> 01:27:58.615
<i>Go hand in hand</i>

01:28:02.611 --> 01:28:04.033
That's my quesadilla!

01:28:04.112 --> 01:28:05.238
Who wants a piece? Huh?

01:28:05.322 --> 01:28:07.165
I know you're in there, Doug,
or whatever your name is!

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.287
You lied to me!

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:13.873
I'm gonna kill you, you stupid fucking cop!

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:16.708
Hey, you guys, shejust called me
a stupid fucking cock. That's rude.

01:28:16.833 --> 01:28:19.211
Dickhead narc motherfucker!

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:22.218
Did shejust say
"nickhead dark motherfucker"?

01:28:22.297 --> 01:28:23.640
That's just racist.

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:25.183
I know these two.

01:28:25.258 --> 01:28:26.931
Your boys are cops! They're cops!

01:28:27.052 --> 01:28:28.224
Police! Get on the ground!

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:30.226
You get on the fuckin' ground!

01:28:30.305 --> 01:28:32.273
- We asked you first!
- I don't give a damn!

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:34.022
You're fucking cops?

01:28:34.100 --> 01:28:35.943
But we partied together, man.

01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:38.568
You bought us Taco Bell.

01:28:38.688 --> 01:28:40.986
Eric, honestly, that was a sincere gesture.

01:28:41.066 --> 01:28:42.568
You made me this friendship bracelet.

01:28:42.692 --> 01:28:45.491
Well, he's not really your friend.
He was pretending the whole time.

01:28:45.570 --> 01:28:47.572
I'm gonna cut this the fuck off later, all right?

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:50.576
What the fuck is going on?

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:52.286
Shut this kid up!

01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:55.463
- Him, too.
- No, no! Hey, wait!

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:56.711
No, no, no. Listen, I'm with you guys!

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:57.916
I didn't know these guys were cops!

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.251
I'm getting out of here.

01:28:59.334 --> 01:29:00.756
I fucking hate you!

01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:02.094
Get that out of my face!

01:29:02.170 --> 01:29:04.093
- Molly!
- Oh, there you are!

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.174
What the fuck!

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:08.727
Drop your guns, or I'll spray her brains
all over the room!

01:29:08.802 --> 01:29:11.180
Trying to take a hostage,
some goddamn TV show shit?

01:29:11.263 --> 01:29:14.312
I don't know! I'm trying to help, all right?
I've never done this shit before.

01:29:14.391 --> 01:29:15.438
Well, you're fucking up.

01:29:15.517 --> 01:29:18.191
- Drop the guns or she's dead!
- She looks dead already.

01:29:18.562 --> 01:29:19.814
What? No.

01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:21.523
<i>Jesus.</i>

01:29:22.482 --> 01:29:24.029
Yeah, I can hear her breathing.

01:29:24.109 --> 01:29:26.328
She just passed out from the drugs.
We're good.

01:29:26.403 --> 01:29:27.495
Drop the guns or...

01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:29.164
All right, all right, just chill out.

01:29:29.239 --> 01:29:30.957
We're gonna drop our guns.

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:34.206
You got to let the kids go,
and no one's gonna die, okay?

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:36.380
Just drop the guns, and kick them over here.

01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:40.084
D.B., shoot these motherfuckers.

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:42.544
Oh, come on, that's unfair!
We put our guns down in good faith.

01:29:42.627 --> 01:29:44.300
You're a liar, and you're mean!

01:29:45.046 --> 01:29:46.889
- That's unfair.
- We're all friends here.

01:29:47.215 --> 01:29:49.343
Let's just relax, and we can
all leave here as friends.

01:29:49.426 --> 01:29:51.724
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Y'all boys are stupid.

01:29:52.178 --> 01:29:55.432
Oh, my God, we're gonna die.
We're gonna die.

01:29:56.141 --> 01:29:57.267
God damn it!

01:29:57.601 --> 01:29:59.478
Tom Hanson, DEA! On your knees!

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:00.608
What the fuck?

01:30:00.687 --> 01:30:02.564
- Now!
- Fuck!

01:30:02.647 --> 01:30:04.741
Doug Penhall, DEA! You're under arrest!

01:30:04.816 --> 01:30:06.944
Guns down, all of you! Domingo, tell them!

01:30:07.235 --> 01:30:09.829
Put them down.

01:30:09.946 --> 01:30:11.448
Nice! Yes!

01:30:11.865 --> 01:30:13.538
Shut the fuck up!

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.870
You little dweebs just ruined
a five-year investigation.

01:30:16.953 --> 01:30:18.079
We had no idea.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:19.540
You're, like, an amazing actor, man.

01:30:19.789 --> 01:30:22.133
You played saxophone
at my sister's wedding, man!

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:23.710
Tough titty. I fucked her, too.

01:30:24.044 --> 01:30:25.216
What?

01:30:25.295 --> 01:30:26.592
You little turds.

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:29.470
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
to infiltrate a gang like this?

01:30:32.844 --> 01:30:34.221
Do you see this nose?

01:30:34.554 --> 01:30:35.897
That is a fake nose.

01:30:36.014 --> 01:30:37.937
Do you want to wear a fake nose
on your fuckin' head

01:30:38.016 --> 01:30:39.859
for, like, months on end'? Glue and shit?

01:30:41.019 --> 01:30:42.271
Worse things in the world.

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:44.607
We had to get fuckin' tattoos
on our dicks, man.

01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:46.566
Hey, actually, I just said that

01:30:46.650 --> 01:30:48.323
-to mess with you.
- What?

01:30:48.401 --> 01:30:49.778
Looks tough.

01:30:49.861 --> 01:30:52.535
Look, we know what
it's like being undercover.

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:53.831
Metro Police, Jump Street Division.

01:30:53.907 --> 01:30:54.999
Come on, you guys are Jump Street?

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:56.122
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:58.169
That's funny, because
we were actually Jump Street.

01:30:58.244 --> 01:30:59.712
- What?
- Yeah. Oh, yeah.

01:31:00.246 --> 01:31:01.293
Oh, shit!

01:31:01.373 --> 01:31:03.216
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, shit.

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:04.292
Oh, my God, dude!

01:31:04.376 --> 01:31:05.628
Get them!

01:31:05.710 --> 01:31:07.337
Motherfucker!

01:31:09.506 --> 01:31:10.883
Shoot them!

01:31:12.300 --> 01:31:13.301
Fuck that.

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:25.730
That was a gun.

01:31:25.855 --> 01:31:27.072
Somebody definitely got shot.

01:31:31.069 --> 01:31:32.070
All right.

01:31:33.113 --> 01:31:35.582
Here, take the money, all right?
We're getting out of here.

01:31:45.208 --> 01:31:46.209
Did I hit anything?

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:47.923
You were shooting at the fuckin' ceiling.

01:31:48.878 --> 01:31:49.970
Doug.

01:31:51.047 --> 01:31:53.971
I know sometimes I was a jerk to you

01:31:54.551 --> 01:31:55.973
when we were undercover.

01:32:01.307 --> 01:32:04.277
It's just... I didn't feel good about myself.

01:32:04.978 --> 01:32:10.109
All that stuff I wore, like the bracelets,
the rings, the tight pants,

01:32:11.568 --> 01:32:12.865
was just so

01:32:12.944 --> 01:32:15.367
that people would think I'm cool.

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:17.536
The only approval

01:32:18.616 --> 01:32:20.334
that I ever needed

01:32:22.579 --> 01:32:23.671
was my best friend.

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:25.957
Thanks, man.

01:32:44.976 --> 01:32:46.569
The money's gone!

01:32:46.644 --> 01:32:48.021
Come on, let's roll.

01:32:48.146 --> 01:32:49.443
We gotta get out of here, man.

01:32:49.522 --> 01:32:50.774
Are you telling me it's on?

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.984
- Let's do this.
- Let's make a baby.

01:32:53.359 --> 01:32:54.827
- What? What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:56.491
I was trying to sound cool. Sorry.

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:50.417
That was crazy! You killed a guy!

01:33:51.459 --> 01:33:53.211
Oh, fuckin' shit!

01:33:55.171 --> 01:33:57.014
Hey, hey, we'll lose them in the prom! Go!

01:34:18.403 --> 01:34:19.575
Go, go: go'

01:34:21.698 --> 01:34:22.870
Where'd they go?

01:34:25.410 --> 01:34:26.411
Molly!

01:34:31.457 --> 01:34:32.504
Shit!

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:38.006
- You want to drive?
- Yeah, I do, actually

01:34:38.089 --> 01:34:39.261
Okay, cool.

01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:42.428
- Nice!
- Did it look cool when I did it?

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:44.433
- That's what I'm talking about!
- Yeah!

01:34:46.931 --> 01:34:48.558
How you guys doing back there, huh?

01:34:48.725 --> 01:34:50.102
God, I love high school!

01:34:50.268 --> 01:34:51.440
Best prom night ever!

01:34:57.150 --> 01:34:58.777
- Shoot them!
- Stay on them!

01:34:59.027 --> 01:35:00.620
I'm on them! I'm on them!

01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:03.244
Oh, good, you guys,
come hang out with me back here.

01:35:03.323 --> 01:35:05.746
- Oh, fuck, dude. Lisa, what are you doing?
- Did she <i>pass</i> out back there?

01:35:09.871 --> 01:35:12.169
Hey, you got a gun.
Why don't you shoot back there?

01:35:12.290 --> 01:35:13.758
Shoot that gun, shoot that gun!

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:15.176
All right, one second!

01:35:15.293 --> 01:35:16.545
Just shoot someone, you bitch!

01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:20.299
Peek-a-boo!

01:35:20.465 --> 01:35:21.637
Give me my money!

01:35:22.508 --> 01:35:24.681
Fuck that! Fuck that! No! No!

01:35:24.761 --> 01:35:27.389
I can't do this!
I'm supposed to go to Berkeley!

01:35:28.890 --> 01:35:29.982
I'm gonna get the party started!

01:35:30.141 --> 01:35:31.563
- I'm gonna get the party started!
- No! No! Lisa, no!

01:35:31.643 --> 01:35:34.772
Hey, I'm living my dream
of standing in a limo!

01:35:34.854 --> 01:35:35.980
What?

01:35:38.566 --> 01:35:40.159
- You're killing my dream!
- Come in.

01:35:40.318 --> 01:35:41.365
- What? I'm trying to party.
- Down!

01:35:41.611 --> 01:35:42.658
Bitch!

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:46.078
What? Fuck!

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:47.500
I'll kill you!

01:35:47.700 --> 01:35:48.701
Kill you!

01:35:49.786 --> 01:35:51.584
- No! No!
- Stay where you are.

01:35:51.788 --> 01:35:52.835
Go! Go, go!

01:35:56.292 --> 01:35:57.635
No! Stop!

01:35:57.710 --> 01:35:59.929
I'm not fucking kidding!
Look, I'm trying to shoot people!

01:36:00.004 --> 01:36:01.347
Will you stop! Just for two seconds!

01:36:01.422 --> 01:36:03.265
You're really hot and you're really slutty
and it's awesome,

01:36:03.341 --> 01:36:04.638
but I got to shoot people right now!

01:36:04.717 --> 01:36:06.139
You think I'm hot?

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.451
Iwanna... Oh, my God!

01:36:23.444 --> 01:36:25.162
Wait, guys! Call me!

01:36:25.238 --> 01:36:26.956
Let me know where you're ending up later.

01:36:31.369 --> 01:36:32.791
I'm almost out of ammo.

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:33.996
We're fucked.

01:36:34.956 --> 01:36:36.048
Give me my money!

01:36:36.541 --> 01:36:37.713
I got an idea.

01:36:37.792 --> 01:36:39.510
- You still got those shotgun shells?
- Yeah.

01:36:40.295 --> 01:36:41.342
Pop Quiznos.

01:36:41.838 --> 01:36:46.344
What do you get when lithium batteries
react to potassium nitrate?

01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:48.974
That would be a covalent bond, brother.

01:36:49.053 --> 01:36:51.556
That's when two atoms, they share electrons.

01:36:51.639 --> 01:36:53.641
You see, they both need
what the other one has.

01:36:53.725 --> 01:36:55.193
That makes them stick together.

01:36:55.268 --> 01:36:56.520
Are you saying we're covalent bonds?

01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:58.692
What? No.

01:36:59.439 --> 01:37:00.816
We're not atoms, dude.

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:20.585
- What's this?
- Tequila?

01:37:21.252 --> 01:37:22.845
I don't know, it was supposed to explode.

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:26.053
Oh, shit!

01:37:30.928 --> 01:37:32.430
Where'd you learn how to do that, man?

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:33.765
App chemistry, bitch.

01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:41.109
Come on, blondie.

01:37:42.982 --> 01:37:44.029
Molly!

01:37:46.819 --> 01:37:48.241
Drop your weapon!

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:49.956
Don't you fuckin' pull that arm up.

01:37:50.239 --> 01:37:51.331
Don't.

01:37:51.699 --> 01:37:55.044
Looks like you're out of ammo, asshole!

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:56.378
Come on! Get out here!

01:37:56.454 --> 01:37:58.172
- What? What's going on?
- All right.

01:37:58.247 --> 01:38:01.467
All right, here's the deal.
Nobody moves, or she's gonna get hurt.

01:38:01.542 --> 01:38:03.886
Do you understand? Nobody move!

01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:05.759
- All right.
- Eric, help me.

01:38:06.464 --> 01:38:07.886
Don't you have a gun?

01:38:08.925 --> 01:38:10.222
All right, don't move!

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:13.308
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.
- No!

01:38:13.429 --> 01:38:15.648
- Hey! Hey, hey!
- Hey, no, no, I said don't move!

01:38:19.602 --> 01:38:22.071
- Oh, fuck, you shot him!
- Oh, God!

01:38:22.146 --> 01:38:23.272
Are you okay?

01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:24.983
You shot my partner, you motherfucker!

01:38:25.149 --> 01:38:27.151
I didn't mean to shoot you!
I meant to shoot him!

01:38:27.276 --> 01:38:30.200
Are you alive, buddy? You okay?
You took a bullet for me, man.

01:38:30.279 --> 01:38:32.702
Yeah, I'm feeling a little ambivalent
about that right now.

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:35.877
Didn't you hear me? I said don't move!
I said that! You heard, right?

01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:37.078
Eric, you heard me!

01:38:37.161 --> 01:38:38.504
- I said don't move!
- Eric, help me!

01:38:38.579 --> 01:38:40.047
- You got this.
- Hey, hold still.

01:38:47.171 --> 01:38:48.343
Freeze!

01:38:48.464 --> 01:38:49.681
Shoot!

01:38:52.677 --> 01:38:53.769
Come on.

01:38:55.179 --> 01:38:57.398
You peaked in high school, motherfucker.

01:38:59.767 --> 01:39:00.893
Oh, shit.

01:39:01.144 --> 01:39:02.191
I shot him in the dick.

01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:04.693
You shot me in the dick!

01:39:04.814 --> 01:39:05.940
Oh, my God!

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:07.150
Yes!

01:39:07.358 --> 01:39:09.110
Yes! Yes!

01:39:09.318 --> 01:39:10.365
Yes!

01:39:10.528 --> 01:39:12.371
You are under arrest!

01:39:12.488 --> 01:39:15.958
- It definitely came out my asshole!
- You have the right to remain silent!

01:39:16.033 --> 01:39:19.128
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

01:39:19.203 --> 01:39:20.295
in a court of law!

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:21.873
You have the right to an attorney!

01:39:21.956 --> 01:39:25.426
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you!

01:39:25.710 --> 01:39:28.554
Do you understand these rights
as they have been read to you?

01:39:28.629 --> 01:39:30.427
Fuck you! Bitch!

01:39:30.548 --> 01:39:32.221
Yes! Yes!

01:39:32.508 --> 01:39:34.135
We did it, man!

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:35.310
We did it.

01:39:35.386 --> 01:39:36.558
God, I feel so good.

01:39:36.637 --> 01:39:38.059
We did it, man!

01:39:38.890 --> 01:39:40.563
You're a goddamn rock star.

01:39:42.059 --> 01:39:43.356
Do you feel that?

01:39:43.436 --> 01:39:44.437
God damn, you're so cool.

01:39:45.104 --> 01:39:46.321
You just shot him in the dick.

01:39:46.981 --> 01:39:48.949
I've never seen that. Who does that?

01:39:49.734 --> 01:39:51.407
Look, I'm sorry I called you Rain Man.

01:39:51.527 --> 01:39:53.950
I know I didn't say you were,
but you're smart.

01:39:54.071 --> 01:39:56.665
You're a smart guy, and you're thoughtful,

01:39:56.741 --> 01:40:00.962
and you're sincere and you're sweet
and you're loyal...

01:40:02.038 --> 01:40:03.790
And I fuckin' cherish you.

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:07.752
Should we high-five?

01:40:13.799 --> 01:40:15.346
My hand!

01:40:16.636 --> 01:40:18.354
Are you all right?
Should we get you to the hospital, man?

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:20.272
- Yeah, I think we need to call somebody.
- Hey, call somebody!

01:40:20.431 --> 01:40:22.354
I got to get my dick sewn back on.

01:40:22.433 --> 01:40:23.980
- You shut the fuck up.
- Hey, you shut up.

01:40:24.185 --> 01:40:25.778
- That's not funny.
- Is that it?

01:40:26.020 --> 01:40:27.146
What?

01:40:28.648 --> 01:40:30.070
That's my dick!

01:40:30.775 --> 01:40:31.822
Pick up my dick! Please!

01:40:31.901 --> 01:40:33.198
No, we're not picking up your dick.

01:40:33.277 --> 01:40:34.699
Fuckin' pick my dick up!

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:38.991
Oh, fuck!

01:40:44.497 --> 01:40:45.669
He's my friend.

01:40:46.499 --> 01:40:48.627
They don't serve vegan in jail, bitch.

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:57.517
Hey.

01:40:59.095 --> 01:41:00.472
Molly...

01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:02.890
I'm really sorry.

01:41:04.141 --> 01:41:07.816
I know you wanted a guy to trust,
and I wanted to be that person so badly.

01:41:08.854 --> 01:41:10.982
And I let you down in a lot of ways.

01:41:11.649 --> 01:41:12.821
And...

01:41:15.194 --> 01:41:16.867
It's good that you're mad at me.

01:41:17.488 --> 01:41:20.207
I think it's good.
I think you should be mad at more guys,

01:41:20.283 --> 01:41:25.335
because you deserve a guy who's good
and who doesn't lie to you.

01:41:25.663 --> 01:41:28.166
And you should never settle
for less than that.

01:41:28.499 --> 01:41:30.467
There are good guys out there

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:34.009
who aren't assholes like me.

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:38.597
Thanks for saving my life,

01:41:38.676 --> 01:41:40.428
asshole.

01:41:43.014 --> 01:41:45.016
Put her there, partner.

01:41:58.362 --> 01:41:59.989
I'll come back later.

01:42:04.702 --> 01:42:07.922
We're, like, in the end of <i>Die Hard</i> right now,
but it's our actual life.

01:42:08.247 --> 01:42:09.294
It's crazy.

01:42:09.373 --> 01:42:11.717
- Number one or two?
- Three.

01:42:12.543 --> 01:42:14.386
- Sam Jackson one. Yeah!
- Sam Jackson style.

01:42:16.005 --> 01:42:19.179
Boom, motherfuckers!
What's going on'? Come on!

01:42:24.013 --> 01:42:25.560
Where is he? There's my guy!

01:42:25.681 --> 01:42:28.025
There he is! That's him. That's him.

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:29.393
- Enough.
- Too long on the hug.

01:42:29.894 --> 01:42:33.694
Congratulations, you crazy,
sick, vigilante motherfuckers.

01:42:33.773 --> 01:42:35.525
You got your first arrest, huh?

01:42:36.525 --> 01:42:38.493
- Look. Got something made for you.
- You didn't!

01:42:38.569 --> 01:42:40.788
- Come on. All right, all right.
- Enough. Enough.

01:42:40.946 --> 01:42:42.243
New assignment.

01:42:42.698 --> 01:42:45.372
Since you two cowboys love to drink booze,

01:42:45.618 --> 01:42:49.668
smoke weed with kids, and fuck
anything with a big ass in jeans

01:42:49.747 --> 01:42:51.090
with low self-esteem,

01:42:51.165 --> 01:42:55.136
I'm gonna send you to a place
where all that shit is allowed.

01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:56.428
Oh, I love Disneyland!

01:42:56.754 --> 01:42:59.849
You two sons of bitches
are going to college!

01:42:59.924 --> 01:43:01.551
"Yes!
- No!

01:43:42.800 --> 01:43:43.801
Boo-yah!

01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:22.677
Oh, my God!
You're like two Hardy Boys in one!

01:44:37.521 --> 01:44:38.522
Oh, fuck!

01:46:28.173 --> 01:46:29.425
<i>Hey, why are you here, Scott?</i>

01:46:29.508 --> 01:46:31.977
<i>What, Kennedy High
isn't having any parties tonight?</i>
