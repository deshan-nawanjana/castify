WEBVTT

00:01:12.573 --> 00:01:14.986
Hey, man. Can I get
two vodka sodas, please?

00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.075
Sure.

00:01:16.618 --> 00:01:18.109
Thank you.
You know what?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.139
Go ahead and keep that
for yourself, all right?

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:21.449
Thanks, man.

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.664
Yeah, I can't wait
to meet you, too, Madison.

00:01:27.504 --> 00:01:29.712
Aw, those babies are legit.

00:01:31.383 --> 00:01:32.383
Jeremy?

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:37.003
Uh, no, sorry.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.177
But this is you,
isn't it?

00:01:40.267 --> 00:01:41.267
Well, yeah...

00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:42.671
But you can't be...
Yeah, Madison.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:44.344
Yeah, I am.

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:47.723
Joke! Oh, my God.

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.085
You should see your face.
Oh, my God.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.941
- No, obviously, I'm not her. No.
- Okay. Oh, man.

00:01:51.028 --> 00:01:52.519
'Course I'm not Madison.
Thank Christ!

00:01:52.613 --> 00:01:54.413
Because, honestly, I was
shitting myself there.

00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:56.401
- I mean, no offense.
- None taken.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.107
It's really risky
meeting people online.

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:00.096
You never know if people are
gonna be as ugly on the outside

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.156
as they are
on the inside.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:03.203
Yeah, right, exactly.
Yeah.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.077
I'm sorry, is Madison
on her way?

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:06.954
No, no, no.
Madison's not coming.

00:02:07.044 --> 00:02:08.251
What? Why?

00:02:08.337 --> 00:02:11.000
Well, she sent me to see if
you were truly in love with her,

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.172
and clearly you're not,
so goodbye, Jeremy.

00:02:13.258 --> 00:02:14.544
Wait! No, no,
no, wait.

00:02:14.635 --> 00:02:15.921
Of course I love her.

00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:18.344
I have been texting with her
for, like, a frigging month!

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.468
This is the girl that I'm
gonna let keep my babies,

00:02:21.558 --> 00:02:23.891
and I will pay her
her due child support.

00:02:23.977 --> 00:02:26.344
I will visit every
other weekend,

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:30.808
and say hi to the kids and put 'em
on my lap and whatever you do, okay?

00:02:30.901 --> 00:02:33.393
That is how much I love
her. I swear to Christ!

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:36.195
But can you love
her birth defect?

00:02:36.281 --> 00:02:37.567
'Course I can.

00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:39.552
I mean, it's on
the inside, right?

00:02:39.576 --> 00:02:41.136
Like, it's in her brain
or in her heart?

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:48.541
When Madison was born,
she was born with A cups.

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:50.251
- No, but her photos, they...
- Yeah.

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:52.829
What you're looking at
there is expert contouring

00:02:52.923 --> 00:02:54.585
and well-placed
chicken cutlets.

00:02:55.634 --> 00:02:58.114
She's really a double-A, if I'm
gonna be, like, honest with you.

00:02:58.178 --> 00:02:59.840
A triple-A
in some brands.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.298
Basically, if her tits were
batteries, they'd go into a watch.

00:03:03.392 --> 00:03:06.009
That's why she didn't wanna come
here and meet you in real life.

00:03:07.062 --> 00:03:09.270
Well, not until she has
the boob job, anyways.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:10.458
Wait, she's getting
a boob job?

00:03:10.482 --> 00:03:11.584
When is that
happening, then?

00:03:11.608 --> 00:03:12.608
In a year.

00:03:12.693 --> 00:03:13.693
A year?

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.377
Well, silicone doesn't
just grow on trees.

00:03:15.404 --> 00:03:16.404
She has to save up.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:17.548
Well, how much
does she need?

00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:19.188
Just, like, $300.

00:03:19.366 --> 00:03:22.325
$500 if she's gonna
go full bouncy castle.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:23.905
Okay.

00:03:23.995 --> 00:03:25.076
You know what?

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.200
Tell her I'll give
her the $500.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.531
I just want her
to be happy.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.708
That is so
selfless of you.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:33.044
- I know.
- Do you prefer Venmo or PayPal?

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.166
Venmo's fine.

00:03:34.256 --> 00:03:36.373
That's her! The fake tit-job bitch!

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:37.466
Get her!

00:03:37.551 --> 00:03:39.884
- I needed a new scene anyway.
- She stole my money, man!

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.962
Move! Out of my way,
come on!

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:44.797
Hey, where do I send
the money?

00:03:44.891 --> 00:03:45.927
Go!

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:51.599
Hey, stop that woman!

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:53.852
Hey, you! Stop!

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.279
Go after her! Quick!

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:05.905
You let her
get away!

00:04:06.288 --> 00:04:09.702
Well, at least we didn't
give her $500 first! Idiot.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.634
Trashy dress,
you did it again.

00:05:25.534 --> 00:05:26.695
Hmm.

00:06:12.122 --> 00:06:14.990
Begone! You French women are bad luck!

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:20.582
And shave your
armpits. Please.

00:06:21.256 --> 00:06:22.792
Well, come on,
deal again!

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:24.920
<i>Our apologies, monsieur,
but you are out of credit.</i>

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.679
Hold on,
I may have a solution.

00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.015
How's this for credit?

00:06:33.101 --> 00:06:34.161
<i>It's beautiful,
monsieur.</i>

00:06:34.185 --> 00:06:35.185
But I cannot accept it.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:36.306
Why the hell not?

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:37.512
I'm afraid...

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:39.142
Rumor has it that
you are selling

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:41.474
your wife's jewels to
bankroll your gambling debts.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.525
That is an
outrageous slur!

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:56.746
Hey. Whiskey.

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.200
- Excuse me?
- Excuse me?

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:00.910
How much are
the red ones worth?

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:02.248
One thousand.

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.500
And the blue ones?

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:05.123
Five thousand.

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:08.793
I love that game with the wheel
and the ball and the numbers.

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:10.647
I don't even really
know how to play.

00:07:10.722 --> 00:07:11.722
Hello.

00:07:12.599 --> 00:07:13.635
Hello.

00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:17.765
My name is Mathias Albrecht von
Rüdiger der Klein-Strogen...

00:07:17.854 --> 00:07:18.970
And you are?

00:07:19.564 --> 00:07:20.564
Janet.
Janet.

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:22.231
What an enchanting name.

00:07:22.901 --> 00:07:23.937
You're American, yes?

00:07:24.027 --> 00:07:25.609
Yes.
I'm Danish.

00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:27.653
Like the pastry?

00:07:28.156 --> 00:07:29.772
Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:30.158 --> 00:07:31.719
So, what brings you
to the South of France?

00:07:31.743 --> 00:07:32.779
An airplane.

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.239
Yes, and why
are you here?

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.366
Oh. Well...

00:07:37.332 --> 00:07:38.994
I thought I would
treat myself.

00:07:39.918 --> 00:07:41.409
I just won some
money in the lottery.

00:07:41.503 --> 00:07:43.495
Wow. How much
did you win?

00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:45.110
$87 million!

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.002
I'm sorry,
I don't speak foreign.

00:07:48.218 --> 00:07:49.254
Janet...

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:53.092
I have something in my pants
that I think you're going to like.

00:07:53.181 --> 00:07:54.513
Ew.
No, no, no.

00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:58.342
This.
Oh.

00:07:58.895 --> 00:08:00.477
This belonged
to my dear mama.

00:08:00.563 --> 00:08:02.350
May I?
Yes.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.102
Sadly, I have to sell it,

00:08:04.192 --> 00:08:05.808
'cause it reminds me
too much of her.

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:06.902
Is it valuable?

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:09.821
It's very valuable, yes.
$500,000.

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:11.655
I like it
'cause it's shiny.

00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.403
And you're in luck.
It's for sale.

00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:14.950
That's crazy. I...

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.236
Do I have enough here?

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:18.872
How much is this worth?

00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:20.289
That is a coaster.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:22.287
And sadly,
no, you don't.

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:26.417
But maybe you could pay the
difference in another way?

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.795
I have a 9:00
dinner reservation.

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:32.092
As do I.

00:08:32.178 --> 00:08:34.545
Well, I have my reputation to think of.

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.297
As do I.

00:08:36.850 --> 00:08:37.966
I have a boyfriend.

00:08:38.435 --> 00:08:39.551
As do I.

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:40.978
Freeze!

00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:44.146
Inspector Desjardins of
Beaumont-Sur-Mer police. Get up.

00:08:44.232 --> 00:08:46.144
Okay. Who sent you?
My wife?

00:08:46.234 --> 00:08:47.234
Do you take bribes?

00:08:47.318 --> 00:08:48.684
Not you. Her.

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.940
She is under arrest.
What?

00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:54.240
Those chips were stolen
from this pathetic old man.

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:58.198
This woman is an
international con artist.

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.325
No, no, no. She's just a dumb American.

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.622
No, it's true.

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:02.708
She lured this man

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.533
with the promise of
a private performance

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:07.244
of her college
gymnastics routine.

00:09:07.338 --> 00:09:08.338
Here.

00:09:10.759 --> 00:09:13.342
Now, give back
the bracelet.

00:09:31.321 --> 00:09:33.438
It would take an expert
to spot the fake.

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:34.942
Or his wife.

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.240
Thank you, Albert...

00:09:38.036 --> 00:09:39.698
For everything.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.996
Excellent research, Brigitte.
The mark was perfect.

00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:43.368
As you always say...

00:09:43.458 --> 00:09:45.666
"You can't cheat an honest man."

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:47.288
Now, I have a buyer
in Zurich,

00:09:47.378 --> 00:09:49.370
<i>so I shall see you in
a few days. Au revoir.</i>

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:12.146
Sorry. Comin' through.

00:10:15.865 --> 00:10:17.276
I'll take
the filet mignon.

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:18.403
Very good, sir.

00:10:23.039 --> 00:10:24.450
Is this seat taken?

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:27.328
I'm starving.

00:10:27.418 --> 00:10:29.705
I could murder a triple
cheeseburger right now.

00:10:29.796 --> 00:10:30.912
Or...

00:10:36.719 --> 00:10:38.426
I'll just get a glass
of water, please.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.763
- Is that all, madam?
- Yeah, that's it.

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:44.558
I'll just help myself
to the sugar packets.

00:10:45.436 --> 00:10:46.552
They're free, right?

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:48.103
- Yes.
- Yeah.

00:10:52.443 --> 00:10:53.524
Mmm.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:11:00.073
That'll fill me up.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:03.153
I have to save all my money
'cause I'm here to find my sister.

00:11:03.246 --> 00:11:04.327
This is her.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:07.448
That is your sister?
Half-sister.

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:08.749
But we're like sisters.

00:11:08.835 --> 00:11:10.604
- What's happened to her?
- She's been taken.

00:11:10.628 --> 00:11:11.709
Taken? Like...

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:15.085
Like by men who
sell hot white virgins

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:17.292
to evil, bearded
kajillionaires on yachts.

00:11:17.385 --> 00:11:19.047
Really?
The whole irony is...

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:22.130
It was her friend she was with
who was the massive slut. Tiffany.

00:11:22.223 --> 00:11:23.384
Tiffany is the slut?

00:11:23.474 --> 00:11:26.512
So, I roughed up these guys,
and they said to me,

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:30.187
"Premium-grade Australian
meat on auction tomorrow."

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:32.835
That fits my sister's description
perfectly, don't you think?

00:11:32.859 --> 00:11:33.859
Yes.

00:11:33.943 --> 00:11:35.783
So, I'm gonna get on that
boat and buy her back.

00:11:35.862 --> 00:11:38.570
Look, I am very moved
by your story.

00:11:38.656 --> 00:11:40.613
Order anything you like.
No, no, no.

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:41.700
Please, no?
No!

00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:43.241
Please, no?
No, I couldn't.

00:11:43.328 --> 00:11:44.819
Please, I insist.

00:11:46.789 --> 00:11:51.250
I'll have a club sandwich, and an
order of fries, order of onion rings.

00:11:51.336 --> 00:11:54.670
I'll take the shrimp cocktail.
Is that good? How fresh is it?

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:58.378
What's the soup of the day?
Is it cold? 'Cause, ew, gross.

00:11:58.468 --> 00:12:00.551
That's disgusting.
Why have cold soup?

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:01.844
Just give me
a Caesar salad.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:03.717
And then two slices of cake.

00:12:03.806 --> 00:12:05.047
Do you want any cake?
No.

00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.848
Three slices of cake
and a Diet Coke.

00:12:06.935 --> 00:12:07.971
Thank you.

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.001
Will this be
satisfactory, miss?

00:12:14.025 --> 00:12:15.025
Yes, this will do.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:18.022
Once again, I apologize for
the flickering lights in coach.

00:12:18.112 --> 00:12:20.274
Epilepsy is
a cruel mistress.

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.694
Thank you.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:29.534
Hey.

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:30.624
Hello.

00:12:35.046 --> 00:12:37.038
Forgive me,
but I couldn't help

00:12:37.131 --> 00:12:39.168
but overhear your
conversation in the dining car.

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.670
My condolences.
Hmm?

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:42.717
About your sister's
treacherous predicament.

00:12:42.804 --> 00:12:44.420
Oh. She'll be all right.

00:12:51.562 --> 00:12:53.053
Do you mind
if I ask how long

00:12:53.147 --> 00:12:55.013
your sister's been
held against her will?

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:57.975
Listen...
Josephine Chesterfield.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:59.069
Penny Rust.

00:12:59.153 --> 00:13:00.360
Delighted.

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:01.778
Eh, what's up?

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.615
Listen, I think this is
gonna be a really long ride,

00:13:04.701 --> 00:13:07.193
and clearly you're, like,
an exhausting person.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.744
So, I'm just gonna say this.

00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:10.446
I don't even have a sister.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.281
Are you saying
you lied to that man?

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.662
I don't wanna
say it too loudly.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:16.243
I'm a con artist.

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.704
I con.

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:21.753
But that man was so kind to
you, and he bought your dinner.

00:13:21.843 --> 00:13:24.051
Only after I showed him
a picture of a hot chick.

00:13:24.137 --> 00:13:26.424
See, women have feelings.

00:13:26.514 --> 00:13:30.133
So, like, you just
had sympathy or pity or...

00:13:31.102 --> 00:13:33.014
I don't know,
the other feeling.

00:13:33.104 --> 00:13:36.518
And men see that quality
in us and exploit us.

00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.815
So, all I'm doin'
is, like...

00:13:38.901 --> 00:13:41.939
<i>Put that thing down,
flip it and reverse it</i>

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.817
And then I'm now
exploiting them.

00:13:43.906 --> 00:13:46.649
Are there many
women in your industry?

00:13:46.743 --> 00:13:48.484
Sisters in arms,
as it were?

00:13:48.578 --> 00:13:50.911
Well, not at
my level, no.

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.204
Yes, clearly you're in
a class of your own.

00:13:53.291 --> 00:13:55.248
Uh, except, of course
there's Medusa.

00:13:55.376 --> 00:13:57.834
Oh? She's like the O.G. lady con artist.

00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:01.084
People say she could freeze a
man's assets with just one look.

00:14:01.841 --> 00:14:02.922
Well,

00:14:03.301 --> 00:14:06.260
my horizons have certainly
been expanded this evening.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:07.803
Where will the wind
take you next?

00:14:07.889 --> 00:14:10.131
I'm going to this town
on the Med...

00:14:10.224 --> 00:14:11.510
Beaumont-Sur-Mer.

00:14:11.601 --> 00:14:14.435
Get this, apparently it's
crawling with rich dudes.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:15.873
Well, I'm afraid
you've been misinformed.

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:18.059
You see, I live in
Beaumont-Sur-Mer,

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:20.607
and I think you'll find
it's a lesbian community.

00:14:20.693 --> 00:14:21.693
Really?

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.395
Yes. Honestly, you'd do better
staying on to Portofino.

00:14:24.489 --> 00:14:26.981
Well, maybe I could
work a woman.

00:14:27.075 --> 00:14:28.111
I don't know how you...

00:14:28.201 --> 00:14:29.533
Yeah, I could give it a go.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:32.327
But isn't your philosophy
based on exploiting men?

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.538
Penny? Penny.

00:14:35.625 --> 00:14:37.662
Sorry, were you... Sorry.

00:14:37.752 --> 00:14:40.290
I was just playing
this game on my phone.

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:42.583
Yes, of course.

00:14:42.673 --> 00:14:45.319
I just have to call my mothers to
let them know what time to expect me.

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.550
Please.

00:14:57.063 --> 00:14:58.474
So, do you have
a car here?

00:14:58.564 --> 00:14:59.645
I do.

00:14:59.732 --> 00:15:01.724
Great. Do you mind if I,
like, scab a lift off you?

00:15:01.818 --> 00:15:02.899
What?

00:15:02.985 --> 00:15:04.146
You leaving the
party already?

00:15:04.237 --> 00:15:05.819
Afraid so. Cheerio.

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:10.534
Penny?

00:15:11.202 --> 00:15:13.194
Did you say Portofino
was the next stop?

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:16.200
Yo, Portofino is going
to be turnt!

00:15:16.541 --> 00:15:17.541
Ooh!

00:15:19.585 --> 00:15:20.585
What?

00:15:21.212 --> 00:15:22.748
I don't know what
you just said, but...

00:15:23.423 --> 00:15:24.880
<i>The answer is oui.</i>

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:51.819
How was last night?

00:15:51.909 --> 00:15:53.821
It was all I could arrange
on such short notice.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:56.494
Jean and Lil Baguette
were perfect.

00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:58.261
May I ask the reason
for their involvement?

00:15:58.332 --> 00:16:00.415
I encountered
a sort of pale gypsy,

00:16:00.501 --> 00:16:02.413
who thought herself
something of a grifter.

00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:04.335
Surely, she was
no match for you?

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:06.664
One can never be
too careful, Brigitte.

00:16:06.757 --> 00:16:09.625
A poacher who shoots at
rabbits may scare big game away.

00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:10.835
Speaking of...

00:16:11.429 --> 00:16:14.763
Next, we have
Gregor Gregorsky.

00:16:14.849 --> 00:16:16.841
Made his fortune
in office supplies...

00:16:16.934 --> 00:16:18.470
Married four times.

00:16:18.978 --> 00:16:20.094
He's a romantic.

00:16:20.605 --> 00:16:23.222
And he should
be arriving...

00:16:23.316 --> 00:16:24.898
Now.

00:16:32.241 --> 00:16:33.402
Who is that with him?

00:16:33.493 --> 00:16:37.328
You must save your beautiful
sister before she is defiled.

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:39.279
I know, 'cause once
she is defiled,

00:16:39.373 --> 00:16:41.490
she's, like, less special,
don't you reckon?

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:42.916
Brigitte.

00:16:43.336 --> 00:16:44.577
Right away.

00:16:45.129 --> 00:16:50.045
Gregor, you have no idea
what this money will do.

00:16:50.676 --> 00:16:52.042
Hit it, Marcel!

00:16:53.804 --> 00:16:55.636
I'm flying!

00:16:55.806 --> 00:16:58.344
Oh, shit!

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:03.813
Ooh!

00:17:19.497 --> 00:17:20.704
<i>Merci.</i>

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:22.827
Mmm-hmm.

00:17:23.209 --> 00:17:25.826
All right. Let's go,
boys, one more time!

00:17:40.351 --> 00:17:42.638
- <i>You want to press charges?
- Da.</i>

00:17:43.229 --> 00:17:46.017
Her sister is probably
not even virgin.

00:17:55.241 --> 00:17:56.982
He gave me the money!

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:59.784
What laws have
I actually broken?

00:18:07.503 --> 00:18:09.085
Contraction.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:12.248
The stress is not
good for the baby.

00:18:12.967 --> 00:18:14.424
Oh, my little baby.

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.297
Ooh...

00:18:16.554 --> 00:18:19.672
<i>We are a tight-knit community in
Beaumont-Sur-Mer, mademoiselle.</i>

00:18:19.765 --> 00:18:21.802
We do not want
your kind here.

00:18:21.892 --> 00:18:22.928
But...

00:18:24.437 --> 00:18:25.973
Ah, yeah, yeah, right, yeah.

00:18:26.063 --> 00:18:28.931
I've heard about
your little community.

00:18:29.734 --> 00:18:30.850
And that's...

00:18:30.943 --> 00:18:32.935
That's actually
why I came.

00:18:34.697 --> 00:18:37.940
To do some,
like, experimenting.

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:40.071
You know...
Ooh.

00:18:42.747 --> 00:18:43.908
Ooh...

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.992
No, wrong thing.

00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.046
Inspector?

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.880
Don't you think we can
just work something out?

00:18:56.218 --> 00:18:58.551
Just between us girls?

00:19:02.141 --> 00:19:04.599
I don't date pregnant women.

00:19:09.607 --> 00:19:11.439
Wait! Actually,
I know somebody here.

00:19:11.525 --> 00:19:13.482
You know someone in
Beaumont-Sur-Mer?

00:19:13.569 --> 00:19:15.401
Yeah, yeah.
I bet you'd know her, too.

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.980
She's, like, really rich,
really important.

00:19:18.074 --> 00:19:21.067
She looks like a librarian's
corpse, only less lively.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.867
She would have
your ass for this.

00:19:22.953 --> 00:19:24.319
Oh, I see.

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:25.779
What's her name?

00:19:25.873 --> 00:19:27.159
Her name...

00:19:29.335 --> 00:19:31.418
Is Joanna.

00:19:31.962 --> 00:19:33.078
Regina.

00:19:33.756 --> 00:19:36.214
Regina Charleston.

00:19:37.343 --> 00:19:41.587
It's Charlotte
Pemberton.

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:45.345
It's Pamela.
It's Pernilla.

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:48.055
Pendy Simmons.

00:19:48.145 --> 00:19:50.057
No, wait, it's...

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.059
Janet Maxfield. Ah!

00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:53.644
Charlotte Josephson.

00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:54.850
Josephine Chesterfield?

00:19:54.944 --> 00:19:56.560
Yeah, that is her!

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.270
We should call her.

00:19:58.364 --> 00:19:59.855
Get her on the line.

00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:03.443
Tell her to set
me free, please!

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.872
Penny, the charges
against you

00:20:09.959 --> 00:20:12.042
aren't very serious,

00:20:12.128 --> 00:20:13.488
but it appears
Inspector Desjardins

00:20:13.546 --> 00:20:16.459
is keeping you here
for your own protection.

00:20:16.549 --> 00:20:17.585
From what?

00:20:18.259 --> 00:20:21.502
The man you swindled is a prominent
figure of the Russian mafia.

00:20:21.595 --> 00:20:22.631
Shit.

00:20:22.722 --> 00:20:24.700
If you were to be released, you
would most certainly be killed

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:25.760
or worse.

00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:28.804
- Well, there has to be another option!
- One moment.

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:44.399
Penny, what do you have
on you by way of liquidity?

00:20:44.952 --> 00:20:46.193
Um...

00:20:46.287 --> 00:20:50.076
I think I have a travel-size
K-Y Jelly in my bag.

00:20:50.166 --> 00:20:51.373
It's peach-flavored.

00:20:51.459 --> 00:20:54.577
Cash, Penny. How much cash
do you have at your disposal?

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:58.960
I have about 10 or 8.
Yeah, $8,000.

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:01.611
That might be enough to get you out
of the country, but you must promise

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:04.594
never ever, under any circumstances,

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.844
to come back to
Beaumont-Sur-Mer ever again.

00:21:07.933 --> 00:21:10.141
Pinky promise.
Hold on, Penny.

00:21:10.227 --> 00:21:12.310
The nightmare
is almost over.

00:21:15.691 --> 00:21:16.932
Hey, listen,

00:21:17.026 --> 00:21:18.795
I may have been a bit of
a bitch when we first met.

00:21:18.819 --> 00:21:19.855
Oh...

00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:21.732
And when I talked about
you behind your back.

00:21:21.822 --> 00:21:23.654
Hmm?
And when I posted this.

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:27.151
Huh.

00:21:27.244 --> 00:21:29.014
But you did me a solid
getting me out of jail.

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:31.371
So, I think you're
a pretty top chick.

00:21:33.793 --> 00:21:35.910
Try to be as inconspicuous as possible.

00:21:36.003 --> 00:21:37.460
I know it's difficult for you,

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:40.209
but it's better to go
unnoticed by Gregor's henchmen.

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:47.762
<i>Au revoir.</i>

00:21:49.558 --> 00:21:51.515
I don't get
what that means.

00:21:52.228 --> 00:21:53.705
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

00:21:53.729 --> 00:21:56.062
<i>this is the final
boarding call...</i>

00:21:56.148 --> 00:21:58.765
Yo, I'm just gonna
blend in with you guys.

00:22:31.809 --> 00:22:32.925
Hey.

00:22:34.562 --> 00:22:36.144
Dude! What are you...

00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:38.893
You can't just sneak up
on a lady like that.

00:22:42.444 --> 00:22:44.185
You're not really my type.

00:22:47.157 --> 00:22:48.568
But the pilot's busy, so...

00:22:55.207 --> 00:22:56.323
Let's just make
this quick.

00:22:56.417 --> 00:22:58.061
I feel like they're
about to serve the meal.

00:22:58.085 --> 00:22:59.701
Where is it?
What?

00:22:59.795 --> 00:23:01.036
Where is it?

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:05.124
Okay. Nazi Gollum, you're gonna
have to speak more clearly.

00:23:05.217 --> 00:23:06.833
Where is it?
What?

00:23:06.927 --> 00:23:10.011
I saw you talking
with her in the airport.

00:23:10.097 --> 00:23:11.213
Josephine?

00:23:11.307 --> 00:23:12.423
Is that her real name?

00:23:12.516 --> 00:23:14.132
Are you with her?
Um...

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.934
No, I think maybe
the police chick is.

00:23:17.021 --> 00:23:18.061
They could just
be friends.

00:23:18.147 --> 00:23:20.013
I don't know. It's
hard to tell nowadays.

00:23:20.107 --> 00:23:21.643
So, the police woman's
part of it?

00:23:21.734 --> 00:23:23.441
Part of what?
The hustle!

00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.356
Mmm?

00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:27.654
She stole my wife's
diamond bracelet!

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.356
It's worth half
a million dollars!

00:23:31.327 --> 00:23:32.488
Shit the bed.

00:23:32.578 --> 00:23:34.365
And now my wife
is filing for divorce.

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.366
Are you working
with her or not?

00:23:36.957 --> 00:23:38.539
No! No, no.

00:23:38.667 --> 00:23:40.374
Uh... Um...

00:23:40.961 --> 00:23:44.204
No, I'm actually
working for ASSES.

00:23:44.298 --> 00:23:45.334
What?

00:23:45.424 --> 00:23:47.632
ASSES? Have you
not heard of that?

00:23:47.718 --> 00:23:53.009
It's the Australian
Securities Services

00:23:53.098 --> 00:23:56.216
Intelligently Spying.

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:57.551
Don't you mean ASIO?

00:23:57.645 --> 00:23:58.681
No.

00:23:58.771 --> 00:24:00.307
No, they're wankers.

00:24:00.397 --> 00:24:02.605
ASSES.
It's the place to be.

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:04.648
And I'm deep, deep,
deep in ASSES.

00:24:04.735 --> 00:24:06.727
I'm trying to bring
her to justice.

00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:07.901
Okay, good.
Yeah.

00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:09.069
Good. How can I help?

00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:15.069
Well, sir, I believe we should
start by having sex as a cover.

00:24:23.003 --> 00:24:24.039
What was that?

00:24:25.381 --> 00:24:26.497
I have standards.

00:24:26.799 --> 00:24:28.381
As do I.

00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:29.583
I need to take a nap.

00:24:29.677 --> 00:24:31.134
As do I.

00:24:33.347 --> 00:24:34.929
I have many STDs, so...

00:24:37.851 --> 00:24:39.467
As do I.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.284
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,
please fasten your seat belts.</i>

00:24:59.373 --> 00:25:02.707
<i>We are experiencing some
unexpected turbulence.</i>

00:25:33.782 --> 00:25:35.148
Whew!

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.321
My quads are burning.

00:25:38.495 --> 00:25:39.827
Ow. Ow.

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:42.288
Bloody hell! No. Okay.

00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:47.376
Yeah.

00:25:47.463 --> 00:25:48.920
I'm gonna puke.

00:25:49.882 --> 00:25:52.169
No. I'm gonna hold it.
I can hold it.

00:25:52.968 --> 00:25:55.085
Penny.
Hello, Janet.

00:25:55.512 --> 00:25:57.799
Or should I say...

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.176
Medusa?

00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:02.801
I am not Medusa.
Really?

00:26:03.312 --> 00:26:05.554
Take this to the guestroom,
butlery person.

00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:15.446
Okay, I may need to borrow a
toothbrush, leggings, some thongs.

00:26:15.532 --> 00:26:16.648
Oh! Some
"going out" thongs.

00:26:16.742 --> 00:26:17.942
Do we have a problem?

00:26:18.494 --> 00:26:22.283
Ah, Captain Pantsuit,
in on it as well?

00:26:22.372 --> 00:26:24.989
All wrapped up in this kebab of lies?

00:26:25.542 --> 00:26:27.625
Everything is fine, Brigitte.
You and Albert may go.

00:26:27.711 --> 00:26:28.747
Yeah.

00:26:28.837 --> 00:26:30.203
Bye, girls.

00:26:30.297 --> 00:26:31.959
I'll take my lunch
by the pool!

00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:34.336
Just letting you know,
I'm salad intolerant.

00:26:35.844 --> 00:26:37.051
What do you want, Penny?

00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:38.594
I want this!

00:26:38.680 --> 00:26:40.546
Like, look
at this place.

00:26:40.641 --> 00:26:43.304
I had no idea how small-time
I was until I met you.

00:26:43.811 --> 00:26:45.598
Teach me your
sugar baby ways.

00:26:45.687 --> 00:26:49.556
Shape me into something
great and richer.

00:26:50.442 --> 00:26:51.603
And why would I do that?

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:52.985
Because who knows?

00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:54.923
I could be the partner
you never knew you needed.

00:26:54.947 --> 00:26:56.904
No, thanks. I work alone.
Hello?

00:26:56.990 --> 00:27:00.199
What about Menswear Barbie
and Old Crone Ken?

00:27:00.285 --> 00:27:01.571
They are employees.

00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:04.366
Okay. I get it.

00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:10.001
But what you're not getting
is that a girl like me

00:27:10.087 --> 00:27:13.046
could make it real uncomfortable
for you in this town.

00:27:13.132 --> 00:27:14.543
Like a bad case
of the herp.

00:27:14.633 --> 00:27:17.091
With the right vitamin
cocktail, you'll go away.

00:27:17.177 --> 00:27:19.715
You do know herpes never
goes away, don't you?

00:27:20.556 --> 00:27:21.967
Doesn't it?

00:27:23.475 --> 00:27:24.636
No.

00:27:27.437 --> 00:27:30.020
Seems like you've set up
such deep roots here.

00:27:30.107 --> 00:27:32.941
It'd be such a shame for it
to all be seized by Interpol.

00:27:34.069 --> 00:27:35.560
It'd just take
one phone call.

00:27:43.787 --> 00:27:44.994
Hello, Interpol?

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.080
Tell me, Penny,

00:27:48.083 --> 00:27:50.951
why are women better
suited to the con than men?

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:54.371
'Cause we're used
to faking it?

00:27:55.257 --> 00:27:58.500
It comes down
to one universal truth.

00:27:58.594 --> 00:28:01.462
No man will ever believe a
woman is smarter than he is.

00:28:03.265 --> 00:28:06.679
We will always be underestimated
and that is what we use.

00:28:08.061 --> 00:28:09.831
So, this means you're gonna
teach me, aren't you?

00:28:09.855 --> 00:28:11.096
I'm teaching you now.

00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:12.271
Yes!

00:28:12.357 --> 00:28:14.144
Wait, what was
that last part?

00:28:14.234 --> 00:28:16.521
I couldn't hear. You were
talking into the ocean.

00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:20.317
What do men want?

00:28:20.407 --> 00:28:22.114
Boobs.
No.

00:28:22.201 --> 00:28:25.410
Back door.
Front door.

00:28:25.495 --> 00:28:26.861
Pegging or, like,
a threesome.

00:28:26.955 --> 00:28:28.412
What is it?
What's the answer?

00:28:28.498 --> 00:28:30.205
They want to be heroes.

00:28:30.292 --> 00:28:33.501
There is nothing more compelling
to a man than a vulnerable woman.

00:28:33.587 --> 00:28:34.623
Observe.

00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:44.428
Oh, wow. You can
just tear up like that.

00:28:44.514 --> 00:28:46.676
You can just balance a tear
right on that lower lid.

00:28:47.309 --> 00:28:49.847
And can you make the tear
roll down your cheek?

00:28:51.188 --> 00:28:53.521
Oh. Oh. Okay.

00:28:53.607 --> 00:28:55.644
But can you make
it go back up?

00:28:57.611 --> 00:28:59.523
Now, you try.
Okay.

00:29:09.498 --> 00:29:10.534
Are you constipated?
No.

00:29:10.624 --> 00:29:13.082
Why all the theatrics?
You're hot. That's enough.

00:29:13.168 --> 00:29:14.249
It is not enough.

00:29:14.336 --> 00:29:15.747
"Hot" is not a career.

00:29:15.837 --> 00:29:20.548
"Hot" will get you gifts and trinkets,
but you must pay for them in other ways.

00:29:20.634 --> 00:29:22.216
Sex, Penny.

00:29:22.886 --> 00:29:25.048
<i>Lesson two, research.</i>

00:29:25.138 --> 00:29:26.674
"The Suburban White Knight."

00:29:26.765 --> 00:29:29.052
This one calls
for a basic rescue scam.

00:29:29.142 --> 00:29:31.976
A staged drowning and
resuscitation usually fits the bill.

00:29:32.062 --> 00:29:35.430
Next, we have "The
Braggadocio on Holiday."

00:29:35.524 --> 00:29:36.924
Just wants a story
to tell the boys.

00:29:36.984 --> 00:29:40.193
But careful here. He's a
frequent abuser of social media.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:44.022
What the...

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:45.176
Why the...

00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:47.112
Headache! Fuck off.

00:29:47.202 --> 00:29:49.945
Finally, you must be
trained for any situation.

00:31:10.035 --> 00:31:11.446
One, two...

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:12.822
Surprise!

00:31:14.664 --> 00:31:16.872
Hello. How do you do?

00:31:16.958 --> 00:31:19.496
Yes, isn't it
a lovely party?

00:31:19.586 --> 00:31:20.702
I know.

00:31:21.254 --> 00:31:23.166
I have seven houses.

00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:34.135
She's ready.

00:31:34.226 --> 00:31:35.467
I'm ready?

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.560
Yes!

00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.020
Whoo!

00:31:47.531 --> 00:31:48.772
I don't like it.

00:31:49.116 --> 00:31:50.948
She represents
everything you despise.

00:31:52.828 --> 00:31:55.616
You know, the water
level at the quarry

00:31:55.705 --> 00:31:57.788
is higher than normal
this time of year.

00:31:57.874 --> 00:31:59.634
They would not find her
body until the spring.

00:32:00.419 --> 00:32:04.754
Just say the word or don't
and you maintain your innocence

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.378
and I will do it anyway.

00:32:07.467 --> 00:32:08.503
Nonsense.

00:32:08.593 --> 00:32:12.382
We're taking her in gracefully in
order to get her out gracefully.

00:32:12.472 --> 00:32:13.713
Was that the word?

00:32:13.807 --> 00:32:14.807
"Gracefully"?

00:32:14.891 --> 00:32:17.349
Trust me, Brigitte. It'll
all work out in our favor.

00:32:17.436 --> 00:32:21.225
<i>With Penny, we can finally run
the Lord of the Rings play.</i>

00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:24.725
You truly believe she is ready
for something so elaborate?

00:32:24.818 --> 00:32:26.901
Who's the first mark?

00:32:28.447 --> 00:32:29.483
Oh, Howard.

00:32:30.031 --> 00:32:31.613
I can't marry you.

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:35.151
Oh...

00:32:35.829 --> 00:32:38.492
Now, settle
down, cupcake.

00:32:39.332 --> 00:32:43.667
What problem's so big you don't
think Howard Bacon can fix it, huh?

00:32:44.087 --> 00:32:47.171
How could you marry
a woman so beneath you?

00:32:48.091 --> 00:32:49.798
What are you saying,
snickerdoodle?

00:32:50.218 --> 00:32:53.052
You are 63rd in line
to the British throne.

00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:56.427
I know, but I'm bankrupt.

00:32:56.516 --> 00:32:58.883
The title's all
I have left.

00:32:58.977 --> 00:33:00.639
Oh, Howard...

00:33:00.729 --> 00:33:03.062
Do you think me a...

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:04.684
Gold digger?

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:09.857
Oh...
Peanut butter cup.

00:33:09.946 --> 00:33:10.946
Now, listen here.

00:33:11.031 --> 00:33:13.865
We're gonna get married, we're
gonna fly home to Fort Worth.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:15.737
I'mma introduce you
to my golfing buddies,

00:33:15.827 --> 00:33:19.241
and then when I run for Senate,
you're gonna be by my side.

00:33:19.915 --> 00:33:22.248
Beautiful and silent.

00:33:22.334 --> 00:33:25.793
You're not gonna break my
heart now, are you, sugarbooger?

00:33:26.213 --> 00:33:27.579
Oh, Howard.

00:33:27.672 --> 00:33:30.585
I'm helpless against your
food-themed endearments.

00:33:31.718 --> 00:33:33.321
The only thing you're
gonna have to worry about

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:35.758
is how that Texas humidity's
gonna affect your hair.

00:33:35.847 --> 00:33:38.464
My hair looks like this
in any climate, darling.

00:33:38.558 --> 00:33:40.675
And Hortense
loves wet heat.

00:33:41.228 --> 00:33:42.228
Hortense?

00:33:42.312 --> 00:33:44.770
My sister. Didn't I tell you about her?

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:47.937
I couldn't possibly
leave her behind.

00:33:49.569 --> 00:33:50.980
Are you telling me
I'm gonna go home

00:33:51.071 --> 00:33:53.154
with two princesses
on my arm?

00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:54.776
Would you like
to see her?

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.402
Oh, lead the way.

00:33:56.493 --> 00:33:58.359
If you think me
regal in the least,

00:33:58.453 --> 00:34:00.945
wait until you meet
my sweet sister.

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:04.578
I haven't an ounce of the
majesty Hortense possesses.

00:34:05.627 --> 00:34:07.584
There are no private
beaches on the Côte d'Azur,

00:34:07.671 --> 00:34:11.460
<i>but you put up one sign that
says "toxic waste," et voila!</i>

00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:12.836
Granny was so clever.

00:34:14.302 --> 00:34:15.463
Your sister
lives in there?

00:34:15.554 --> 00:34:18.763
Mmm-hmm. Yes, in her
cozy castle keep.

00:34:23.228 --> 00:34:24.719
This way.

00:34:24.813 --> 00:34:26.429
Your tetanus is up
to date, yes?

00:34:26.523 --> 00:34:27.809
What?

00:34:27.899 --> 00:34:30.642
Every royal family has
its black sheep, of course.

00:34:30.735 --> 00:34:32.476
But not Hortense and me.

00:34:32.571 --> 00:34:35.985
Nanny Gertrude raised us to be
two levelheaded young ladies.

00:34:36.074 --> 00:34:38.566
We're so normal,
it's practically boring.

00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.698
Now remember, at no point
should you turn your back on her.

00:34:41.788 --> 00:34:43.905
Because she's royalty?

00:34:44.624 --> 00:34:45.740
If you like.

00:34:45.834 --> 00:34:47.041
Ah, here we are.

00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:49.494
Hortense, I've brought a guest!

00:34:49.588 --> 00:34:51.079
I wonder
where she's hiding.

00:34:51.172 --> 00:34:53.289
Don't be shy.

00:34:53.967 --> 00:34:55.048
I know.

00:34:57.053 --> 00:34:59.466
Maybe her subjects
can flush her out.

00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:11.520
Ah, there she is!

00:35:11.610 --> 00:35:14.023
My only living relative.

00:35:14.112 --> 00:35:16.149
Shall we pay
her a visit?

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:23.698
Princess Hortense
of House

00:35:23.788 --> 00:35:26.201
Northumberton-
Saxe-Hapsburg,

00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:29.659
may I present to
you Howard Bacon.

00:35:33.089 --> 00:35:34.455
Uh...

00:35:34.549 --> 00:35:36.541
My... my...
My ma'am... Lady.

00:35:36.635 --> 00:35:40.925
Sir Bacon, welcome
to thy kingdom.

00:35:41.014 --> 00:35:42.971
I have food
for your men,

00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:45.550
and water for your
horses and whores.

00:35:45.644 --> 00:35:47.306
Oh, Hortense.

00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:50.058
She knows you haven't
got any horses.

00:35:50.148 --> 00:35:51.980
Lucretia, pour the mead.

00:35:56.738 --> 00:35:58.458
Lucretia, you dumb bitch,
don't embarrass me

00:35:58.490 --> 00:35:59.526
in front of the guests.

00:35:59.616 --> 00:36:01.573
Yes, there is much to
celebrate, beloved sister.

00:36:01.660 --> 00:36:02.946
I bring wonderful news.

00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:06.078
Howard and I
are to be married.

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:08.531
Really?

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:12.042
You and you?

00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:13.748
Hortense.

00:36:16.466 --> 00:36:19.049
Hortense, do not
drop that coronet.

00:36:20.845 --> 00:36:23.588
Use your words,
not the heirlooms.

00:36:24.265 --> 00:36:25.506
Whoops.

00:36:30.605 --> 00:36:31.605
Why?

00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:34.933
- Why? Why? Die!
- I think I know what this is about.

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:36.517
No!
Don't fret, sissy.

00:36:36.611 --> 00:36:38.648
You shan't
be left behind.

00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:44.864
You, Howard, and I are going
to live together in Texas.

00:36:44.953 --> 00:36:46.160
Texas?

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:47.661
Hurrah!

00:36:47.997 --> 00:36:50.364
This calls for a celebration pole dance.

00:36:55.714 --> 00:36:58.377
Promise, if anything
should happen to me,

00:36:58.466 --> 00:37:00.173
you'll look after her.

00:37:01.261 --> 00:37:04.129
<i>- Ooh, I invoke prima nocta.
- Absolutely.</i>

00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:06.930
This shall be a traditional
wedding in every respect.

00:37:07.016 --> 00:37:10.475
<i>Prima nocta.
Prima nocta! Prima nocta!</i>

00:37:11.479 --> 00:37:14.392
<i>What's a prima nocta?</i>

00:37:14.482 --> 00:37:18.021
Oh. Once the eldest daughter
consummates her marriage,

00:37:18.111 --> 00:37:20.023
it is the second
daughter's divine right,

00:37:20.113 --> 00:37:22.821
either to bed the groom
or fight him in a duel.

00:37:22.907 --> 00:37:24.677
In either case, your
performance shall be judged

00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:25.908
by a panel
of courtiers.

00:37:25.994 --> 00:37:27.826
But you don't mind,
do you, darling?

00:37:27.912 --> 00:37:32.407
<i>Second sister
gets sloppy seconds</i>

00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:38.167
<i>Or you die</i>

00:37:38.673 --> 00:37:40.790
Muffin, wedding's off.

00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:43.630
But Howard! The ring!
Keep it!

00:37:56.608 --> 00:37:58.474
Enrique, do go on.
You were saying

00:37:58.568 --> 00:38:01.060
how even though you yourself
have benefited economically

00:38:01.154 --> 00:38:02.565
from immigrating
to America,

00:38:02.655 --> 00:38:05.068
you don't feel any
additional Guatemalans

00:38:05.158 --> 00:38:06.820
should be allowed
into Palm Beach?

00:38:06.910 --> 00:38:10.324
Yes, I believe...
Sister! Sister! Sister!

00:38:10.413 --> 00:38:12.120
Hortense!
Manners, please!

00:38:12.207 --> 00:38:13.869
Is this how we behave
in front of a guest?

00:38:13.958 --> 00:38:15.165
Sorry.

00:38:16.377 --> 00:38:19.586
Pardon the intrusion, but can
I beg leave to go to the toilet?

00:38:19.672 --> 00:38:20.879
Yes, of course,
my turtle dove.

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:22.206
Thank you.

00:38:22.675 --> 00:38:25.759
Kind sir, would you
help me with this?

00:38:28.389 --> 00:38:30.051
The lock-eth
has rust-eth.

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.348
Hortense!

00:38:31.434 --> 00:38:35.018
Did I not expressly forbid you from
wearing your virtue panties in the pool?

00:38:35.104 --> 00:38:37.221
Albert! She's done it again.

00:38:38.733 --> 00:38:40.850
Not the flame!

00:38:52.163 --> 00:38:53.950
Release the peasants!

00:38:54.374 --> 00:38:56.411
She must mean
"pheasants", yes?

00:38:56.501 --> 00:38:57.501
Of course not.

00:38:57.585 --> 00:38:59.952
Don't worry, darling.
She's a terrible shot.

00:39:01.923 --> 00:39:03.289
Peasant ho!

00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:06.918
See?

00:39:14.853 --> 00:39:17.095
That was unexpected.

00:39:24.362 --> 00:39:26.604
Brigitte, your 20,000.

00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:28.338
You just got a lot
more attractive, Bridge.

00:39:28.408 --> 00:39:29.649
Albert, your 10.

00:39:29.742 --> 00:39:30.982
Still wouldn't
bang you, Albert.

00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:34.619
Thank you, all.

00:39:36.541 --> 00:39:38.032
What do you mean,
"Thank you, all"?

00:39:38.126 --> 00:39:40.459
No, where's my cashola?
Where's my cut?

00:39:40.545 --> 00:39:42.628
Where's the big chunk of...
Ah-ah...

00:39:42.839 --> 00:39:44.580
To come in to me, of the cash?

00:39:44.674 --> 00:39:48.964
The student doesn't earn
wages until after graduation.

00:39:49.137 --> 00:39:51.345
When the hell is that?

00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:54.973
I've been killing myself playing
Hortense the Feral Princess

00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:57.847
while you just prance around,
not having sex with people.

00:39:57.937 --> 00:40:00.680
Penny, how much money do
you have? Be honest, now.

00:40:02.609 --> 00:40:04.441
$500,000.
Oh.

00:40:04.777 --> 00:40:07.565
Good for you. It's an
adorable little nest egg.

00:40:07.739 --> 00:40:09.230
All in cash, I presume?

00:40:09.324 --> 00:40:12.067
Bitcoin. Why? How
much money do you have?

00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:17.952
Hmm? Oh. Assets and
liquidity, 28.32 million.

00:40:18.249 --> 00:40:21.242
Okay, I didn't know we were
counting assets and liquidity.

00:40:21.336 --> 00:40:24.374
In that case, I have... Still 500,000.

00:40:24.464 --> 00:40:29.175
And how do you think I grew
that wealth? By investing wisely.

00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:31.172
I've invested
in you, Penny.

00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:33.754
And I must see a robust return
before I can share the profits.

00:40:34.182 --> 00:40:37.300
But you wouldn't have any
profits if it wasn't for me, okay?

00:40:37.393 --> 00:40:39.385
Let's face it, we were a team on this.

00:40:39.479 --> 00:40:41.766
Penny, if you want to be like
me, then you're going to...

00:40:41.856 --> 00:40:45.065
I don't wanna be like you!
Why would I wanna be like you?

00:40:45.151 --> 00:40:49.566
I don't wanna be some loser that
looks like a colorful Beetlejuice.

00:40:49.989 --> 00:40:53.778
Oh. Sorry, Julie Andrews just called.
She said she wants her voice back.

00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:56.030
We all know you're
actually from Wisconsin

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.033
and you stay in this house
eating weird salads

00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:02.616
and drinking alcohol that doesn't
get you hammered fast enough.

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.917
And you're like,

00:41:04.003 --> 00:41:09.590
"Oh, I better check all my
precious stocks on the NASCAR index.

00:41:09.676 --> 00:41:10.712
"And, oh, wait,

00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:14.170
"let me just collect another
little boy's head

00:41:14.263 --> 00:41:18.257
"or another
dinosaur clitoris

00:41:18.351 --> 00:41:21.844
"or another little statue
of a..." That's alive.

00:41:21.938 --> 00:41:25.147
Yes, that is a Madagascan blue
panther chameleon.

00:41:25.233 --> 00:41:26.849
It's one of the last
of its kind.

00:41:26.943 --> 00:41:30.402
Oh, is it?
Just like you.

00:41:30.488 --> 00:41:32.024
Well, you know what, Jo?

00:41:32.115 --> 00:41:34.277
I don't give a crap if
you're a legend in the game.

00:41:34.367 --> 00:41:36.261
If you're not gonna pay me for
work that I've actually done,

00:41:36.285 --> 00:41:37.742
then I'm out!

00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:39.286
Screw you, Medusa!

00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:40.954
I'm not Medusa.

00:41:44.836 --> 00:41:47.123
And she's gone.

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:19.033
Are you all right, miss?

00:42:19.662 --> 00:42:21.949
Is there a doctor
in the house?

00:42:22.331 --> 00:42:24.288
Somebody, please, help me!

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:27.163
What are the signs of a
stroke? I can't feel my tits!

00:42:29.338 --> 00:42:30.499
Goodness me!

00:42:31.841 --> 00:42:34.458
Are you all right, miss?
Are you okay?

00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:36.280
She's all right.
Aren't you, sis?

00:42:40.808 --> 00:42:43.721
Yeah, I'm feeling so
much better, actually.

00:42:43.811 --> 00:42:46.724
Good on you. That's my chuck. Come on.

00:42:46.814 --> 00:42:48.396
Come on.
Let's get you up.

00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:50.044
- Yeah.
- No worries.

00:42:50.068 --> 00:42:51.434
I think it was just
a big burp.

00:42:51.527 --> 00:42:53.314
- You enjoy the sun.
- My pleasure.

00:42:53.446 --> 00:42:55.549
- What's up, Jo?
- I thought you were leaving, Pen.

00:42:55.573 --> 00:43:01.035
I was, and then I just
realized this place is great.

00:43:02.038 --> 00:43:06.624
There just isn't room for
both of us in Beaumont-Sur-Mer.

00:43:06.709 --> 00:43:08.871
Mmm.
Agree to unagree.

00:43:08.961 --> 00:43:13.205
This is my home
and my place of work

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:16.875
and you are a bull
in my china shop.

00:43:16.969 --> 00:43:20.679
Well, you don't really
affect my life that much.

00:43:20.765 --> 00:43:22.256
Oh, piss off,
you moon-faced troll!

00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:24.933
Whoa. Careful there.

00:43:25.019 --> 00:43:27.932
People might think you're more
than just an animatronic cocktease.

00:43:28.022 --> 00:43:29.354
Okay, come on.

00:43:31.818 --> 00:43:33.354
Ow. Arm!

00:43:33.903 --> 00:43:37.362
Hands off the merchandise.
I bruise like a peach.

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:39.861
Shall we settle this
with a friendly wager?

00:43:39.951 --> 00:43:43.115
Like a turf war? Whoever
wins gets dibs on the town?

00:43:43.204 --> 00:43:45.412
Loser leaves for good.

00:43:45.498 --> 00:43:46.864
Well, what's the bet?

00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:50.872
We choose a man. First to
extract a set sum from him wins.

00:43:50.962 --> 00:43:53.375
That sounds like a
party. Yeah, how much?

00:43:53.464 --> 00:43:57.458
How about your net worth?
500,000? I'm sorry.

00:43:57.552 --> 00:43:59.418
Is that too rich
for your blood?

00:43:59.804 --> 00:44:00.804
Are you kidding?

00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:04.256
My blood is, like, 98%
white chocolate mousse.

00:44:05.059 --> 00:44:09.019
So, I can handle it, yeah.
Who's the mark?

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:12.521
<i>Monsieur?</i>

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.567
How about that guy?

00:44:16.362 --> 00:44:17.523
He's 12.

00:44:17.613 --> 00:44:19.605
Ah. Too young
for your blood?

00:44:20.032 --> 00:44:24.447
Guillaume. Is that boy
a guest at the hotel?

00:44:24.537 --> 00:44:26.177
Yes,
that is Thomas Westerburg.

00:44:26.247 --> 00:44:27.988
He is the inventor
of YaBurnt.

00:44:28.583 --> 00:44:30.290
Shut my back door.
What? Why?

00:44:30.376 --> 00:44:32.493
What is YaBurnt?

00:44:33.004 --> 00:44:35.621
Honestly? Jo, are you,
like, 100 years old?

00:44:35.715 --> 00:44:37.923
It's, like, this
really cool app

00:44:38.009 --> 00:44:40.028
where it sends all your
friends these disgusting insults

00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:41.488
and then they disappear
after 10 seconds.

00:44:41.512 --> 00:44:42.753
Why would
anyone want that?

00:44:42.847 --> 00:44:44.930
Why would anyone want Christmas, either?

00:44:45.016 --> 00:44:48.100
So, he's a tech
millionaire?

00:44:48.186 --> 00:44:51.145
Billionaire, I bet.
So, do we have a deal?

00:44:51.772 --> 00:44:54.640
One week.
May the best con win.

00:45:17.798 --> 00:45:21.087
Hey, do you mind if I
spin the thingy next round?

00:45:23.429 --> 00:45:26.012
Okay. That's your job.

00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:27.597
Shut up, Thomas.

00:45:34.357 --> 00:45:36.019
<i>- Monsieur.
- Yes?</i>

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.482
Please place your bets.

00:45:51.624 --> 00:45:52.865
No more bets.

00:45:56.879 --> 00:45:58.290
Eighteen red.

00:46:03.427 --> 00:46:04.588
Sorry, comin' through.

00:46:04.679 --> 00:46:06.295
Sorry, excuse me.

00:46:06.389 --> 00:46:07.866
- My goodness!
- Sorry, miss, please.

00:46:07.890 --> 00:46:11.258
Oi, blind person here.
Move! Move!

00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:13.973
Yeah. Yeah.

00:46:15.189 --> 00:46:17.101
Oh. Pardon
the intrusion,

00:46:17.191 --> 00:46:20.059
but could somebody tell me if
there's an empty chair at this table?

00:46:20.152 --> 00:46:22.189
- <i>No, mademoiselle. The table is full.
- Oh.</i>

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.737
Okey-dokey.
No, miss. Miss?

00:46:24.824 --> 00:46:26.656
Excuse me.
You can have my chair.

00:46:26.742 --> 00:46:29.655
Oh, a hero. But it's
not necessary.

00:46:29.745 --> 00:46:31.907
Perhaps if this
person scoots over,

00:46:31.998 --> 00:46:33.910
we could just squeeze
in another chair.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.992
Yeah, sure.
Do you mind, sir?

00:46:36.085 --> 00:46:37.542
Would you mind just...

00:46:38.337 --> 00:46:40.294
Right behind you.
Oh.

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:41.917
There you go.

00:46:42.008 --> 00:46:43.215
Thank you.
All right.

00:46:43.301 --> 00:46:45.509
What wonderful blind person etiquette.

00:46:45.594 --> 00:46:47.005
My nana was blind.

00:46:47.596 --> 00:46:50.009
Was she?
I had no idea.

00:46:50.891 --> 00:46:51.972
Research.

00:46:52.268 --> 00:46:53.787
Please place your bets.

00:46:53.811 --> 00:46:56.224
Oh. Do you want me
to place a bet for you?

00:46:56.314 --> 00:46:57.350
Yeah, could you?

00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:59.853
Yeah, of course.
But can you choose?

00:46:59.942 --> 00:47:02.025
I feel like I need somebody
else's luck right now.

00:47:02.111 --> 00:47:03.192
Sure.

00:47:03.279 --> 00:47:05.441
Okay. All right, keep
your fingers crossed.

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:09.065
No more bets.

00:47:10.703 --> 00:47:11.944
Twenty-one red.

00:47:12.038 --> 00:47:13.074
How did we do?

00:47:13.164 --> 00:47:14.905
We lost.
I'm so sorry.

00:47:14.999 --> 00:47:17.412
What?
Yeah, it happens.

00:47:17.501 --> 00:47:18.867
That was my
last chance.

00:47:19.420 --> 00:47:22.879
Last chance?
For... Wait! Miss!

00:47:23.549 --> 00:47:24.960
Miss, wait. Miss?

00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:26.278
<i>Monsieur, your chips.</i>

00:47:26.302 --> 00:47:27.713
Oh, yeah, thank you.

00:47:32.058 --> 00:47:33.765
Thank you, thank you.
Sorry.

00:47:35.311 --> 00:47:36.311
Thank you. Miss!

00:47:39.607 --> 00:47:41.189
Miss? Miss?

00:47:42.109 --> 00:47:43.389
Your winnings.

00:47:47.573 --> 00:47:50.441
Miss! Miss? Miss?
Excuse me? Hi.

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:51.695
You left your cane.

00:47:52.036 --> 00:47:53.777
Thanks for bringing
it back.

00:47:53.871 --> 00:47:56.284
I'm so embarrassed. Did
I, like, cause a big scene?

00:47:56.374 --> 00:47:59.082
No, no. It's okay. But you
said something in there.

00:47:59.168 --> 00:48:02.252
You said that that was
your last chance. What for?

00:48:02.338 --> 00:48:03.624
To help my sister.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:06.457
Oh.
She's my baby sister.

00:48:06.884 --> 00:48:07.965
Oh.

00:48:08.052 --> 00:48:10.465
You're looking at a picture
of a really hot girl, right?

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:13.297
Uh... Yes.
Yeah, I am.

00:48:13.808 --> 00:48:15.595
Are my eyes tearing up?

00:48:17.228 --> 00:48:19.641
'Cause sometimes
I can't tell.

00:48:24.652 --> 00:48:26.063
At least you
won big, huh?

00:48:26.570 --> 00:48:27.936
Not yet.

00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:31.148
Go and see what big-titted
Russell Crowe is up to.

00:48:31.784 --> 00:48:33.070
<i>Here.
Here you go, Penny.</i>

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.322
No, no, no, Thomas.
I cannot take that.

00:48:35.413 --> 00:48:37.200
Yes, you can, Penny.
No, I can't.

00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:38.575
Penny, you have to.

00:48:38.666 --> 00:48:41.374
Your sister needs that
final cleft palate surgery.

00:48:41.836 --> 00:48:44.203
Yeah, she does.

00:48:44.296 --> 00:48:45.296
Penny...
Mmm.

00:48:46.132 --> 00:48:48.966
- What about you?
- What do you mean, what about me?

00:48:49.051 --> 00:48:51.759
Well, do you mind
if I ask you how you...

00:48:51.846 --> 00:48:54.008
Got blind?
Yeah.

00:48:56.225 --> 00:48:58.808
My condition
is 100% mental.

00:48:58.894 --> 00:49:00.556
Hysterical blindness?

00:49:00.646 --> 00:49:02.182
It's not that funny
to me, Thomas.

00:49:02.273 --> 00:49:04.310
No, I know.
What I mean is,

00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:07.814
it means there's hope for you
to see again. Right?

00:49:07.903 --> 00:49:10.361
People say that,
but I've tried everything.

00:49:10.781 --> 00:49:12.818
Hypnosis, drugs...

00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:14.274
I even hired
this guy Barry

00:49:14.368 --> 00:49:17.361
to follow me around and scare
me in parking structures.

00:49:17.746 --> 00:49:19.328
He'd just be
like, "Hey!"

00:49:20.541 --> 00:49:23.659
Turns out this is not like
having the hiccups.

00:49:23.752 --> 00:49:25.414
Well, there must be something.

00:49:25.504 --> 00:49:29.043
Well, there is, like,
this one psychologist,

00:49:29.133 --> 00:49:30.499
up in this clinic
in Germany

00:49:30.968 --> 00:49:33.551
that does, like,
really cutting-edge stuff.

00:49:33.762 --> 00:49:35.674
But it's so expensive.

00:49:35.764 --> 00:49:37.471
Well, how much does
this doctor charge?

00:49:38.517 --> 00:49:39.758
$500,000.

00:49:39.852 --> 00:49:41.764
Damn!
I know!

00:49:42.104 --> 00:49:44.642
But Dr. Schauffhaussen
is that gifted.

00:49:46.984 --> 00:49:49.476
Forget about it. What
is sight worth, anyways?

00:49:49.987 --> 00:49:51.603
$500,000?

00:49:52.156 --> 00:49:53.442
Seems so.

00:49:59.497 --> 00:50:01.329
She's using
all your tricks.

00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:03.991
Fine.

00:50:04.084 --> 00:50:05.495
Let's use some of hers.

00:50:08.339 --> 00:50:10.219
- But enough about me.
- Let's talk about you.

00:50:10.591 --> 00:50:12.002
What's your story?

00:50:12.092 --> 00:50:14.049
No, well,
no story, really.

00:50:14.136 --> 00:50:17.846
These French investor
guys flew me out here

00:50:17.932 --> 00:50:19.332
I guess to hear about my new venture.

00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:21.140
But I'm starting
to feel like

00:50:21.227 --> 00:50:23.184
they just want
another YaBurnt.

00:50:23.270 --> 00:50:24.852
Ya-what?
YaBurnt.

00:50:25.231 --> 00:50:26.722
It's an app that
I designed.

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:27.893
Oh.

00:50:27.983 --> 00:50:31.317
Like an appetizer? I love
'em when they're bottomless.

00:50:33.113 --> 00:50:34.649
That's good.

00:50:36.367 --> 00:50:38.199
No, not an appetizer.

00:50:38.953 --> 00:50:41.787
An app like an application
for a smartphone.

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:42.872
Oh, okay.

00:50:42.957 --> 00:50:44.448
But my new concept,

00:50:44.917 --> 00:50:48.752
it's something that I think
could really help people

00:50:50.047 --> 00:50:54.758
if anyone would actually
listen to what I have in mind.

00:50:56.220 --> 00:50:58.803
I get it.
You're a really kind guy.

00:50:59.515 --> 00:51:04.226
I could see that.
If only I could see.

00:51:04.478 --> 00:51:05.639
Penny...

00:51:07.356 --> 00:51:10.064
Penny, what is the name of
that doctor you told me about?

00:51:10.526 --> 00:51:12.893
Oh. Um... Doctor...

00:51:15.281 --> 00:51:16.281
Schauffhaussen.

00:51:16.365 --> 00:51:17.509
Schauffhaussen.
Schauffhaussen.

00:51:17.533 --> 00:51:19.650
How do you spell that?
Is that S-C-H?

00:51:19.743 --> 00:51:20.859
Sure.

00:51:20.953 --> 00:51:22.410
Okay.

00:51:22.496 --> 00:51:24.909
Wait, what are you doing?
I'm looking him up online.

00:51:27.209 --> 00:51:30.623
Not much is known about the good
doctor. I hear he's a recluse.

00:51:30.713 --> 00:51:31.749
No, I found his website.

00:51:32.256 --> 00:51:33.713
Really?
Awesome.

00:51:33.799 --> 00:51:34.960
Whoa.

00:51:35.301 --> 00:51:36.712
No, here's an email address.

00:51:37.803 --> 00:51:39.294
Okay, you're kidding me.

00:51:39.388 --> 00:51:40.504
What? No way.

00:51:40.598 --> 00:51:42.055
Yeah.
No way.

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:44.762
I've sent something.
There we go.

00:51:44.852 --> 00:51:47.060
See what happens.
Thomas, no, you...

00:51:47.521 --> 00:51:49.763
No.
You really shouldn't have.

00:51:50.566 --> 00:51:51.932
Let's not get
our hopes up.

00:51:52.026 --> 00:51:54.018
Okay. He responded!

00:51:54.403 --> 00:51:56.065
Of course he did.

00:51:56.155 --> 00:51:57.612
Oh, it's an
out-of-office reply.

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.606
Oh...

00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:01.362
Let's see if he's
on social media.

00:52:02.703 --> 00:52:03.739
Oh, my God.

00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:05.741
No way! Oh, my God.
What?

00:52:16.634 --> 00:52:18.717
Uh, excuse me, sir?

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:21.340
Hi. My name's Thomas,

00:52:21.430 --> 00:52:25.470
and my friend, Penny, really,
really needs your help.

00:52:25.559 --> 00:52:29.894
I just saw your photo on Instagram,
and I had to come find you.

00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:34.475
This is beyond coincidence. It means
something that you're here. Um...

00:52:35.444 --> 00:52:37.231
So, what do you say,
Dr. Schauffhaussen?

00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:39.570
Will you help
my friend?

00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:52.958
Siri, I need to
learn German.

00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:55.207
That is not German.

00:52:57.549 --> 00:52:58.630
That is Dutch.

00:52:58.717 --> 00:53:00.049
Oh. Um...

00:53:01.136 --> 00:53:03.219
Hi, we met at
the roulette table.

00:53:03.305 --> 00:53:05.012
That is incorrect.
We did not meet.

00:53:05.099 --> 00:53:06.886
Otherwise, you would
know that I...

00:53:06.975 --> 00:53:08.011
You're Dr.
Schauffhaussen?

00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:11.018
Precisely.

00:53:23.367 --> 00:53:24.824
No, wait,
Dr. Schauffhaussen.

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:26.321
I'm sorry if
I offended you.

00:53:26.412 --> 00:53:27.573
I am not offended.

00:53:27.663 --> 00:53:30.747
It's just that I looked you up
online, I couldn't find a photo,

00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:34.042
and, I don't know, I just didn't
think you would be a woman.

00:53:35.587 --> 00:53:36.828
I am offended now.

00:53:36.922 --> 00:53:38.754
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

00:53:38.841 --> 00:53:41.754
Please don't punish
Penny for my sexism.

00:53:42.386 --> 00:53:43.593
Penny?

00:53:44.513 --> 00:53:46.550
Is this Penny from
Cootamundra, Australia?

00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.006
Yes! Yeah, that's her.

00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:51.935
I remember her letters.
Such a tragic case.

00:53:52.980 --> 00:53:54.141
Good luck to you both.

00:53:54.231 --> 00:53:55.267
Wait.

00:53:55.357 --> 00:53:56.793
Dr. Schauffhaussen,
what do I have to do

00:53:56.817 --> 00:53:58.934
to get you to see
her here, tonight?

00:53:59.027 --> 00:54:00.643
Young man...
Thomas.

00:54:01.071 --> 00:54:04.735
Thomas, it would be inappropriate
and unprofessional of me

00:54:04.825 --> 00:54:06.225
to see patients
while on my holiday.

00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:08.572
Well, if it's a matter
of money, I can...

00:54:08.662 --> 00:54:10.181
You haven't given her
any money, have you?

00:54:10.205 --> 00:54:12.117
Well, some. But just for her sister.

00:54:12.207 --> 00:54:17.828
You must not, under any
circumstances, give the patient money.

00:54:17.921 --> 00:54:20.789
Otherwise, this reinforces the
notion that she's truly disabled,

00:54:20.883 --> 00:54:22.499
rendering the
treatment kaput!

00:54:23.886 --> 00:54:26.378
Wait, so you will
treat her?

00:54:27.306 --> 00:54:30.219
- I agree to an initial examination.
- Yes!

00:54:30.309 --> 00:54:34.895
I am too much the softie.
Where is she now?

00:54:40.194 --> 00:54:41.194
Penny?

00:54:44.573 --> 00:54:47.031
Coming. Just one second!
One sec.

00:54:47.993 --> 00:54:50.360
I've got
a surprise for ya.

00:54:51.663 --> 00:54:53.871
Thomas, where did you go?
Yeah?

00:54:53.957 --> 00:54:56.040
You'll never guess
who I found.

00:54:56.126 --> 00:54:57.242
Who?

00:54:57.336 --> 00:54:59.256
JOSEPHINE AS
Who do you think?

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.669
It's Dr. Frederika
Schauffhaussen.

00:55:05.093 --> 00:55:06.800
She can't believe it.

00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:08.823
<i>Believe it, Froulein.</i>

00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:12.807
I am here to help you,
dear girl.

00:55:13.018 --> 00:55:15.351
Dr. Schauffhaussen was having
dinner at the hotel tonight.

00:55:15.854 --> 00:55:18.813
I saw her Insta post.
Isn't it incredible?

00:55:19.191 --> 00:55:21.729
- Incredible.
- I must make my assessment of the patient.

00:55:21.819 --> 00:55:22.980
Thomas?
Yes?

00:55:23.070 --> 00:55:24.481
I require a chair.

00:55:26.824 --> 00:55:27.940
A warning.

00:55:28.408 --> 00:55:31.492
My methods
are unorthodox.

00:55:32.538 --> 00:55:33.538
You understand?

00:55:34.289 --> 00:55:35.621
Yes.
Thank you.

00:55:35.707 --> 00:55:37.915
Remove your person from
the treatment space.

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:39.412
Oh. Okay, here?

00:55:45.092 --> 00:55:46.092
Sit.

00:55:47.344 --> 00:55:50.678
So, you can see
absolutely nothing?

00:55:50.848 --> 00:55:53.431
No shapes,
no light, no color?

00:55:53.517 --> 00:55:55.600
No, nothing at all.
That's what I said...

00:55:55.686 --> 00:55:56.767
Silence.

00:55:58.105 --> 00:55:59.141
Hey, I need that.

00:55:59.231 --> 00:56:02.099
You will no longer use
this crutch of the mind.

00:56:05.028 --> 00:56:07.566
Stubborn like the patient.

00:56:10.075 --> 00:56:11.782
I see.

00:56:11.869 --> 00:56:14.737
You do not, but I see.

00:56:18.792 --> 00:56:20.249
Has the test started yet?

00:56:21.378 --> 00:56:22.869
Impressive.

00:56:23.171 --> 00:56:24.753
Okay, Penny.

00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:26.297
How about this?

00:56:36.184 --> 00:56:37.766
I am funneling
the air directly

00:56:37.853 --> 00:56:39.469
into your eye cavity.

00:56:41.857 --> 00:56:43.849
My mouth hole
is very narrow.

00:56:43.942 --> 00:56:45.649
You should not
be feeling this.

00:56:55.704 --> 00:56:57.491
I just smell salmon.

00:57:00.417 --> 00:57:01.874
It's very
interesting.

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:05.874
The body reacts, but the mind does not.

00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:11.213
Penny, I would like you
to have a little snack.

00:57:11.303 --> 00:57:13.670
<i>But you must guess the food
that you're eating, ja?</i>

00:57:13.764 --> 00:57:15.721
Yeah, that sounds
easy enough.

00:57:21.355 --> 00:57:22.846
I will ready the snack.

00:57:25.442 --> 00:57:27.934
<i>In stiller Nacht</i>

00:57:28.946 --> 00:57:32.781
<i>Zur ersten Wacht</i>

00:57:33.158 --> 00:57:36.697
<i>Ein Stimm' begunnt</i>

00:57:38.205 --> 00:57:41.664
<i>Zu klagen</i>

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:45.289
<i>Der nächt'ge Wind</i>

00:57:45.379 --> 00:57:48.543
<i>Hat süß und lind</i>

00:57:50.133 --> 00:57:51.340
Okay, Penny.

00:57:51.426 --> 00:57:53.258
Here comes
the choo-choo train.

00:57:53.345 --> 00:57:56.088
Open wide.

00:57:57.015 --> 00:57:59.348
Ahh...

00:58:04.064 --> 00:58:05.521
What is that?

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:08.023
A french fry.

00:58:08.235 --> 00:58:10.522
Can I have another one?

00:58:12.823 --> 00:58:15.156
You are a very
good blind person.

00:58:15.242 --> 00:58:16.362
As such, you
must surely know

00:58:16.451 --> 00:58:19.444
the number of steps
between you and the door.

00:58:19.538 --> 00:58:20.699
Mmm-mmm.

00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:24.157
And the number from the
door to the elevator.

00:58:24.251 --> 00:58:26.959
Because this is how the
visually-impaired function in the world.

00:58:27.045 --> 00:58:29.405
<i>Otherwise, you would be running
into things all the time, ja?</i>

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:32.548
Yeah, I know
all the steps.

00:58:34.261 --> 00:58:35.877
Okay, Penny.

00:58:36.513 --> 00:58:39.972
I have opened the door.
An unobstructed path exists.

00:58:40.058 --> 00:58:46.225
I want you to run full-speed down
hallway and stop in front of the elevator.

00:58:46.314 --> 00:58:47.521
<i>You can do this, then, ja?</i>

00:58:47.607 --> 00:58:49.724
Yeah, well, of course, then.

00:58:49.818 --> 00:58:52.026
Yeah, it's pretty simple
for a blind person

00:58:52.112 --> 00:58:54.479
to just run in
a straight line, so...

00:58:55.115 --> 00:58:58.404
<i>Wunderbar.
As fast as you can. Go!</i>

00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:01.778
<i>Um... Now?
Ja.</i>

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:09.414
Penny!

00:59:11.131 --> 00:59:12.667
I will take the case.

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:28.186
Come, Thomas,
I give you a tour.

00:59:28.273 --> 00:59:29.480
Okay.

00:59:30.901 --> 00:59:32.483
Should we...
Come.

00:59:32.944 --> 00:59:34.310
Quickly now.

00:59:34.404 --> 00:59:35.940
But what about...
Thank you.

00:59:36.031 --> 00:59:38.273
Is this it? Hello?

00:59:38.366 --> 00:59:40.403
We're here?

00:59:42.954 --> 00:59:43.954
Hello? Uh...

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:48.366
Oh, it's on.

00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:50.793
Dr. Schauffhaussen,
about your fee.

00:59:50.879 --> 00:59:52.620
I have to move
a few things around,

00:59:52.714 --> 00:59:54.501
but I'll have it
for you really soon.

00:59:54.591 --> 00:59:55.923
Hey, guys?

00:59:56.009 --> 00:59:58.877
I think somebody accidentally
locked the front door.

01:00:00.263 --> 01:00:03.256
Guys? Guys,
are you there?

01:00:03.725 --> 01:00:05.182
Whoa.

01:00:05.769 --> 01:00:09.558
Sorry! I hope that wasn't a
priceless work of art or anything!

01:00:09.648 --> 01:00:11.640
What if she gets
hurt out there?

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:13.770
This is precisely why we
do not intervene, Thomas.

01:00:13.860 --> 01:00:16.523
Negative reinforcement
is the prescription.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.572
<i>It is our job,
yours und mine,</i>

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:21.149
to have fun.
Fun?

01:00:21.243 --> 01:00:23.075
Fun.
Okay.

01:00:23.161 --> 01:00:25.244
<i>You're thinking
I am loony tune, ja?</i>

01:00:26.248 --> 01:00:28.456
I am not.
No?

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:30.749
If we do this
in front of Penny,

01:00:30.919 --> 01:00:32.160
have the fun...

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:37.090
She will want nothing more than
to join us in our seeing fun.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:38.801
Yeah.

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:41.502
Why do I smell clinical
strength lady douche wipes?

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.134
Oh.

01:00:44.224 --> 01:00:45.465
Very strong.

01:00:47.102 --> 01:00:49.685
No pity, Thomas.
Only fun.

01:00:50.272 --> 01:00:52.434
I also smell
early menopause.

01:00:52.524 --> 01:00:53.524
Now, the house.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.448
Why are we doing
this again?

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:09.281
Just as you take
Thomas' arm when we walk,

01:01:09.374 --> 01:01:11.536
so you take my leash
when we ride.

01:01:11.626 --> 01:01:13.743
That makes zero sense.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.453
A hill approaches.

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:21.466
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:23.089
<i>Merci.
Merci.</i>

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:25.388
This Cabernet.
Oh, I love this one.

01:01:25.473 --> 01:01:27.510
It turns
quite chewy...

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.804
- <i>Und you can really taste oak.
- Can I have some?</i>

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:33.096
Oh. Of course, Penny.
You may have some of mine.

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.101
Oh.

01:01:37.861 --> 01:01:39.568
Um... Is there a glass here?

01:01:39.654 --> 01:01:43.147
You may drink the wine when you see
the glass well enough to seize it.

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:50.996
Oh. Oh, God. Did I
spill something just now?

01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.416
Oh, I'm so clumsy.

01:01:54.502 --> 01:01:57.461
Dr. Schauffhaussen,
let me help you.

01:01:57.547 --> 01:01:58.788
Oh, no. I feel terrible.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:00.877
Did I spill wine
on your...

01:02:14.856 --> 01:02:15.856
Waiter!

01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:30.745
Uh, are you sure that
this is helping Penny?

01:02:30.830 --> 01:02:33.493
Trust me, this is
for Penny's sake.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:34.790
Okay.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:36.771
JOSEPHINE AS
You should see us, Penny.

01:02:36.795 --> 01:02:38.661
Thomas and I are dancing.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.621
I wish I could.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:44.049
Oh, but you can,
Penny. You can.

01:02:44.135 --> 01:02:47.173
Yeah, I could also eat my own
shit, but I'm not doing that either.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:50.177
It's okay, I'll just stand
here minding your bag.

01:02:52.435 --> 01:02:54.893
She's got a fuzzbox
and knows how to use it.

01:02:55.563 --> 01:02:56.563
Pardon?

01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.058
Your friend with the bony ass,
grinding away on that poor boy.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.272
Oh.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:03.978
Yeah, I wouldn't
mind so much.

01:03:04.072 --> 01:03:05.675
It's just that he used
to be my boyfriend.

01:03:06.783 --> 01:03:08.069
He was not!

01:03:08.159 --> 01:03:09.991
And she's my best friend.

01:03:10.078 --> 01:03:11.660
She is not!

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:14.371
Oh, my God.

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:18.167
Babe, you are,
like, actually blind.

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:19.539
Oh, babe.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:21.495
Blind as in
"can't see" blind?

01:03:21.589 --> 01:03:24.047
It was when I lost my sight
that she moved in on him.

01:03:24.134 --> 01:03:26.046
Shut up.

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:27.718
Watch us, Penny.

01:03:27.804 --> 01:03:31.423
The way our bodies
move in unison.

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:35.430
So sensual.

01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.557
Right. I'm hitting her
really hard in her vagina.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:41.266
It's just if I could work out
some way to get him alone...

01:03:41.359 --> 01:03:43.521
Then maybe he wouldn't
call off the wedding.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:45.944
You leave it with us,
all right? I mean...

01:03:46.031 --> 01:03:48.569
We are practically professionals,
my little blind poppet.

01:03:49.075 --> 01:03:50.907
Girls, toilet.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.088
That color looks
boss on you.

01:04:05.342 --> 01:04:06.628
<i>Danke.</i>

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:12.846
What is this?

01:04:12.932 --> 01:04:15.390
It's a little thing we
invented called Varma.

01:04:15.477 --> 01:04:17.560
Karma.

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:20.520
It is on.

01:04:20.607 --> 01:04:22.974
It is on like
Kim Kardashian.

01:04:25.070 --> 01:04:26.982
Is that nice?
Yeah, you want some?

01:04:27.072 --> 01:04:28.313
Oh! Yeah, sure.
Sorry.

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.692
Uh...

01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:31.198
Yeah. Thank you.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:34.364
It's kinda weird
that Dr. Schauffhaussen

01:04:34.454 --> 01:04:36.446
just disappeared
like that, right?

01:04:36.581 --> 01:04:38.117
Germans are
so spontaneous.

01:04:38.958 --> 01:04:42.201
It's probably just part of
her crazy treatment plan.

01:04:42.504 --> 01:04:44.962
Yeah, don't give up
on that, Penny, okay?

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.289
I mean, I know
that it's hard,

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:48.500
but there's so much that
you deserve to see.

01:04:49.094 --> 01:04:50.210
Like this view

01:04:50.303 --> 01:04:51.589
and these lights...

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:53.466
And the face you make

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:54.888
when you think
I'm being a dork.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:56.181
What, this one?

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:59.142
Yeah, that one.

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:00.854
But that one...

01:05:00.939 --> 01:05:02.680
That one's my favorite.
What?

01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:04.936
That one.
No, what?

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:06.652
Shut up.

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.798
Well, you'll just have
to take my word for it.

01:05:08.822 --> 01:05:12.065
As the sole sighted
person between us,

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.524
you're beautiful, Penny.

01:05:17.122 --> 01:05:19.239
Anyway, I'm sure
Dr. Schauffhaussen's

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.574
gonna break out the
big psychological guns

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:23.375
once I actually
give her the fee.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:28.251
Oh. Um... Yeah, about that.
I was gonna say to you,

01:05:28.341 --> 01:05:29.877
is it possible to give
me the money

01:05:29.968 --> 01:05:33.336
and then I'll just give it
to Dr. Schauffhaussen?

01:05:33.430 --> 01:05:35.797
I know this
will sound silly,

01:05:35.890 --> 01:05:39.349
but it would just make me feel
like I'm less of a charity case.

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:40.768
Totally. I completely understand.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:44.689
I... I just have to
sell the last of my stock.

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:48.733
Wait, don't you own, like,
the whole company?

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.561
You're, like, so rich.

01:05:51.364 --> 01:05:52.730
No.
No?

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.110
No, um...

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:56.738
The algorithm for
YaBurnt was mine,

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:59.115
but the seed investors
actually bought me out.

01:05:59.664 --> 01:06:00.780
Yeah, for how much?

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:02.160
A cool million.

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:05.208
But I only have
400,000 left.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:07.838
But it's okay.

01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:10.255
My nana's gonna
loan me the rest.

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:13.000
So, after you pay
the Dr. Schauffhaussen fee,

01:06:13.094 --> 01:06:14.094
you'd be broke?

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:15.636
Yeah, but it's fine.

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:18.385
Because I have a lot of good
ideas, and hoodies are cheap.

01:06:19.434 --> 01:06:20.434
I don't get it, though.

01:06:20.518 --> 01:06:23.135
Why would you bankrupt yourself
for someone you don't even know?

01:06:24.189 --> 01:06:25.396
Like, I'm a stranger.

01:06:26.441 --> 01:06:28.398
Well, my nana...

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:31.944
My nana always said that the
best thing money can do is good.

01:06:32.197 --> 01:06:34.234
And you getting to
see again is good.

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:38.446
Plus, you're not
a stranger.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:40.740
You're Penny.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:43.197
Yes, I am.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:56.404
Honey, I'm home.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:06:59.596
Oh, please.

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:02.891
You think I can't handle
the Real Housewives of Essex?

01:07:04.395 --> 01:07:06.978
It took a considerable
amount of limoncello

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:08.417
and several rounds
of arm wrestling,

01:07:08.441 --> 01:07:10.478
<i>but c'est la vie.</i>

01:07:10.568 --> 01:07:12.230
The bet's off, Jo.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:15.609
Oh, don't go, Penny. You've
taught me so much about love.

01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:18.782
We need to find another mark.
No, absolutely not.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.638
I have had about as much
of this absurd interlude

01:07:20.662 --> 01:07:22.028
with you as I can bear.

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:26.708
Those are decorative.

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:29.169
He's a good guy, Jo.

01:07:29.254 --> 01:07:31.246
That's a moxy-noron,
Pen.

01:07:31.339 --> 01:07:34.457
Okay, you know, back in the
day when I was just catfishing,

01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:37.670
there was always this one
moment where I would decide...

01:07:39.055 --> 01:07:40.546
"I'm gonna take your money."

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:44.680
And it wasn't when they fell for
the superficial hot girl bait,

01:07:44.769 --> 01:07:48.012
or when they texted dick
pics like complete animals.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:51.185
It was when we'd meet up in person,

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:53.142
and I'd come in...

01:07:54.153 --> 01:07:55.153
And he'd just...

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.235
Look at me like that.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:04.782
And that's when I'd
decide to rob him blind.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:10.118
But when Thomas looks at
me, he doesn't do that.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.294
He's just different.

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:13.916
He's a genuinely nice person.

01:08:14.007 --> 01:08:15.964
Yeah, but we're not nice
women, Penny, are we?

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:17.791
And this isn't a likability contest.

01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:19.342
Lucky for you, 'cause I'd win.

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:20.465
Would you?

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.547
Please. Thomas loves me.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:26.266
He loves you?

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.228
Like, I mean, he'll do whatever I want.

01:08:29.314 --> 01:08:31.681
Well, then it appears
we have our solution.

01:08:35.486 --> 01:08:38.399
If you don't have the
stomach to take money

01:08:38.489 --> 01:08:40.446
from your darling Thomas...

01:08:41.659 --> 01:08:43.241
Darling Thomas becomes the bet.

01:08:43.328 --> 01:08:45.240
But I thought you
didn't nail your marks.

01:08:45.330 --> 01:08:47.663
Evidently, we must up the ante
in this little game of ours.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.741
Unless, of course, you
feel you're outmatched.

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:52.042
Please. Guys love asses,

01:08:52.795 --> 01:08:55.037
but not when there's something
already stuck up there.

01:08:56.591 --> 01:08:58.207
Then we're agreed.

01:08:58.301 --> 01:09:00.258
Thomas is the bet.

01:09:00.887 --> 01:09:02.253
Yeah.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:05.885
Yeah.

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.101
Well, okay.

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:11.429
I should really get to bed,

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:14.515
'cause I've got such a big
day of seduction tomorrow.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:15.941
Oh, absolutely.

01:09:16.027 --> 01:09:17.563
How about a bedtime story?

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:19.941
No, that's not necessary. Albert!

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:24.942
Oh! Hi.

01:09:25.453 --> 01:09:26.453
Thank you.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:27.869
Oh, that's not good.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.742
I do so admire their spirit.

01:09:29.832 --> 01:09:31.289
Less so their spray tans.

01:09:31.376 --> 01:09:32.583
Ladies.

01:09:35.129 --> 01:09:36.461
All right, my babe.

01:09:39.717 --> 01:09:42.300
Oh, so, you thought
you could play us, yeah?

01:09:42.387 --> 01:09:43.423
Ladies, I can explain.

01:09:43.513 --> 01:09:45.926
Babes, this is not a
good situation for you.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.301
My cousin's got the blinds

01:09:47.392 --> 01:09:48.599
from the diabetes. Diabetes.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.677
Don't go to the hotel now, Jo.

01:09:50.770 --> 01:09:53.763
Give it the night. He'll be
more energetic in the morning.

01:09:53.856 --> 01:09:55.125
Oh, you're not going anywhere.

01:09:55.149 --> 01:09:57.015
Ladies, pass me the superglue.

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:08.368
Thomas. Dr. Schauffhaussen.

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:09.535
Please...

01:10:10.415 --> 01:10:11.781
Call me Frederika.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:13.372
Okay.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.536
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

01:10:17.505 --> 01:10:18.586
Come on in.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:19.997
Um...

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:29.906
JOSEPHINE AS Thank you.

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:32.259
A little treat for us.

01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:35.979
We've been working so
hard for sweet Penny.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:39.058
<i>We deserve to be a little selfish, ja?</i>

01:10:39.736 --> 01:10:41.477
Some say these are an aphrodisiac.

01:10:41.571 --> 01:10:42.607
Oh, no, thank...

01:10:42.697 --> 01:10:45.690
Oh, God. I'm so sorry, Doctor...

01:10:45.783 --> 01:10:46.844
No! I got it. It's fine, it's fine.

01:10:46.868 --> 01:10:48.668
- I got it, I got it.
- It's...

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.009
Thank you.

01:11:07.054 --> 01:11:08.054
Thomas...

01:11:08.306 --> 01:11:10.218
I must be candid.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:13.558
I'm here under false pretenses.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.221
<i>You are? Ja.</i>

01:11:28.534 --> 01:11:31.823
I hope this isn't inappropriate, but...

01:11:32.914 --> 01:11:34.997
<i>Would you help me with mein coding?</i>

01:11:35.166 --> 01:11:36.247
<i>"Mein coding"?</i>

01:11:36.417 --> 01:11:38.329
<i>Ja, I'm having trouble with my website.</i>

01:11:38.419 --> 01:11:40.251
Oh. Coding!

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.921
Yeah, sure. What seems
to be the problem?

01:11:43.090 --> 01:11:44.126
Well...

01:11:45.259 --> 01:11:47.171
When I use JavaScript,

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:50.550
the HTTP crawler is not
scraping the metadata correctly,

01:11:50.723 --> 01:11:53.215
and I am losing the CSS properties.

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.386
Did you try parsing the
CSS separately using regex?

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:02.141
I did not. Hmm.

01:12:08.199 --> 01:12:11.237
Fixed! Well, it's
been a really long day.

01:12:11.327 --> 01:12:13.193
I'm exhausted, so I'm gonna...

01:12:14.205 --> 01:12:16.868
Are you aware that it
is a full moon tonight?

01:12:19.752 --> 01:12:22.586
I love to feel the air on my skin.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.504
Right. Aren't you kinda cold, though?

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.009
What are you doin'?

01:12:30.596 --> 01:12:32.178
I feel reckless tonight, Thomas.

01:12:33.266 --> 01:12:35.428
Okay, that's not funny.
Can you come inside now?

01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:37.679
If I fell, would you catch me?

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:38.854
Stop it.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:40.438
Don't.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:41.898
Don't!

01:12:46.445 --> 01:12:47.481
Thomas.

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:48.983
Dr. Schauffhaussen... Frederika.

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:50.756
You've taught me so
much about discipline.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:51.783
I can teach you more.

01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:53.530
<i>And integrity. Ja, sure.</i>

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:56.032
I think we should keep things
professional between us.

01:12:56.122 --> 01:12:58.489
Oh... For Penny's sake.

01:13:01.627 --> 01:13:02.708
For Penny's sake?

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:06.747
Of course.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:10.000
Well, I'll just...

01:13:12.179 --> 01:13:13.179
Go.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:28.820
Wait.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.873
Mmm. Thomas.

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.084
Oh. Albert? Albert. Hey, man.

01:13:48.716 --> 01:13:50.673
Um... Just a shot in the dark.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.844
Do you happen to have superglue remover?

01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:57.557
Holy crap.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:13:58.803
How did you have that?

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.475
Yeah, that's awesome.

01:14:00.645 --> 01:14:02.136
Yes. Legend.

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:04.562
Uh...

01:14:05.066 --> 01:14:06.182
Albert?

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:09.484
Ah, come on, that's just cruel!

01:14:37.932 --> 01:14:39.218
Hey, you. Hey.

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:42.763
Do you know who Josephine
Chesterfield is? Or Dr. Schauffhaussen?

01:14:42.853 --> 01:14:44.890
<i>Oui, mademoiselle. We
know all her aliases.</i>

01:14:44.981 --> 01:14:46.438
She's very generous.

01:14:50.528 --> 01:14:52.315
All right, so was she here last night?

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:54.146
<i>Oui, with the tech boy.</i>

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:56.731
Damn it. Okay.

01:14:58.244 --> 01:15:03.205
Well, wait. When she left, did she
seem, like, you know, satisfied?

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:05.657
Like, you know, like, she'd got some?

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.868
Oh, no. No?

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:09.328
She hasn't left yet.

01:15:33.654 --> 01:15:36.772
Yeah, I know you won.
I'm getting outta here.

01:15:37.283 --> 01:15:39.070
Uh, what did I win?

01:15:39.785 --> 01:15:42.072
Thomas, what are you doing here?

01:15:42.163 --> 01:15:44.746
I'm here to say goodbye.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.912
Where's Dr. Schauffhaussen, then?

01:15:49.003 --> 01:15:50.915
Um, I don't know.

01:15:51.005 --> 01:15:53.668
This morning, she kind
of left in a hurry...

01:15:54.133 --> 01:15:55.874
And now I have to go.

01:15:57.011 --> 01:15:58.718
The investors are...

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:00.011
They're flying me home.

01:16:00.097 --> 01:16:01.679
I just needed to say...

01:16:01.766 --> 01:16:05.976
Penny, you're the one genuine,
good thing that happened to me here.

01:16:10.316 --> 01:16:11.773
Anyway, um...

01:16:14.111 --> 01:16:15.111
Bye, Penny.

01:16:22.078 --> 01:16:23.114
Thomas, wait! Don't go!

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:36.758
Penny!

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:38.546
Oh, my God!

01:16:38.636 --> 01:16:39.717
Penny, are you okay?

01:16:39.804 --> 01:16:41.841
This has been a brutal week.

01:16:46.102 --> 01:16:47.102
Dick.

01:16:49.563 --> 01:16:52.772
Wait, Penny, could you just see Albert?

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:54.975
Uh...

01:16:55.069 --> 01:16:56.981
Did you just look at... Can you see me?

01:16:58.656 --> 01:17:00.192
Is your hair brownish?

01:17:00.282 --> 01:17:01.944
Yes! Yes, it is!

01:17:02.993 --> 01:17:04.234
Wait, Penny.

01:17:04.328 --> 01:17:05.694
Can you read that?

01:17:05.788 --> 01:17:07.324
No, that's in French.

01:17:07.414 --> 01:17:09.076
Oh... Sorry.

01:17:09.166 --> 01:17:10.407
What about this?

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:13.619
"Social anxiety. You're not
the problem, the world is."

01:17:13.712 --> 01:17:15.578
Yes! Penny, you can see!

01:17:15.673 --> 01:17:17.255
I can finally see your face!

01:17:17.341 --> 01:17:19.879
Oh, that's probably a
bummer. No, come off it!

01:17:20.678 --> 01:17:22.260
You got such a nice face.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:27.679
I guess Dr. Schauffhaussen's
money was put to good use, huh?

01:17:29.186 --> 01:17:30.393
What do you mean?

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.639
You didn't give her
the 500,000, did you?

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:34.732
Yeah, of course.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:36.857
I wanted to make sure that
your treatment continued.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:38.734
No, no. But that was all that you had.

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:42.572
It was worth every penny, Penny.

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:47.743
Wait a minute. I don't understand.

01:17:47.830 --> 01:17:50.197
You're giving me $500,000?

01:17:50.291 --> 01:17:52.251
My sister just won the
lottery in Australia.

01:17:52.293 --> 01:17:55.081
And she used my birthday and
my bra size, so she owes me.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:57.624
I can't let you cover
my medical expenses.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:59.877
Well, regardless, I cannot accept this.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:03.627
Thomas, no, I insist.

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:04.962
Well, I resist.

01:18:07.641 --> 01:18:10.304
Stop. It's a $2
transaction fee every time.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:12.727
Oh, shit. Well, it's
in your account now.

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.224
No take-backs.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.228
Okay.

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:18.354
Penny...

01:18:19.987 --> 01:18:21.523
Do you wanna come?

01:18:21.864 --> 01:18:22.980
Come with me.

01:18:23.073 --> 01:18:24.280
I'm not coming with you.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:25.527
Why not?

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:28.284
'Cause you don't know me.

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.074
Not the real me.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.700
Well, I'd like to...

01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:36.660
If you ever change your mind.

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:46.846
All right.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:57.809
What have you done?

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.232
How could you let him leave?

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:00.684
What are you talking about?

01:19:00.778 --> 01:19:01.939
You won the bet.

01:19:02.029 --> 01:19:03.895
Stop!

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:07.573
Come back! Come back! Come back! No! No!

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:14.664
Aw. The plane didn't
stop for the crazy lady.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:15.866
Here she comes.

01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:17.496
Walk of shame.

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.670
Walk of shame. Walk of shame.

01:19:21.966 --> 01:19:25.209
Last night, I went to his room
and, yes, I tried to seduce him.

01:19:25.302 --> 01:19:27.739
And I thought I was getting somewhere,
too, because he turned out the lights,

01:19:27.763 --> 01:19:29.846
but it was only to show me
a PowerPoint presentation

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:31.343
all about his new app.

01:19:31.433 --> 01:19:34.221
Once he had finished his
pitch, I assumed we'd go to bed.

01:19:34.311 --> 01:19:38.646
Then he said he's bit of a germophobe,
so would I mind taking a shower...

01:19:38.732 --> 01:19:40.143
And I was insulted,

01:19:40.234 --> 01:19:42.476
but I complied for the sake of the bet.

01:19:42.569 --> 01:19:44.811
And when I emerged, he was
gone, my clothes were gone,

01:19:44.905 --> 01:19:46.146
my jewelry, my phone, my laptop,

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:48.607
even my limited edition Jimmy Choos!

01:19:52.329 --> 01:19:53.536
Come off it.

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:54.953
You expect me to believe

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:59.034
that that kind guy tried
to jack your Jimmy Choos

01:19:59.128 --> 01:20:02.587
when he just returned to me
$500,000 that I tried to give him?

01:20:05.134 --> 01:20:07.171
Why did you give him $500,000?

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:09.674
Because that's the
amount you stole from him.

01:20:09.763 --> 01:20:12.847
No! That is what I'm
saying, tits for brains!

01:20:12.933 --> 01:20:14.174
I didn't steal from him.

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:16.851
I invested in his app!

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:18.561
How much?

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:21.731
$500,000.

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:24.191
It's from Thomas.

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.394
Ahh! No!

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.229
Let me see! Let me see!

01:20:40.586 --> 01:20:41.667
That means...

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:43.620
You're Thomas' nana.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.582
Oh, you sick perv! No! Christ, Penny!

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.668
Clearly, Thomas' nana was Medusa,
and she passed the torch on to him,

01:20:49.762 --> 01:20:50.878
and now he's the new Medusa.

01:20:50.971 --> 01:20:52.587
What is wrong with you?

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:55.257
He didn't transfer me the Bitcoin back.

01:20:57.019 --> 01:20:58.635
He still has my 500,000.

01:20:58.729 --> 01:21:00.766
And my 500,000.

01:21:02.816 --> 01:21:05.479
Did we just give that
boy a million dollars?

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:10.192
Are you kidding me?

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:12.148
Of all the lying... No!

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:15.527
...two-faced, conniving,
cheating... Dude, are you serious?

01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:16.681
...slimy millennial bastard hacker...

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:17.766
I'm so angry and horny right now!

01:21:17.790 --> 01:21:19.622
...grifter shit-stained assholes,

01:21:19.708 --> 01:21:21.870
he is the worst!

01:21:27.508 --> 01:21:30.467
But he is kinda awesome, too, right?

01:21:53.117 --> 01:21:56.360
Albert, I'm sorry for
calling your balls skeletal.

01:21:57.287 --> 01:21:59.153
I know there's nothing hard down there.

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:00.868
Suck it.

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:14.511
Thanks for letting me
stay the extra two weeks.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.345
One more than agreed upon.

01:22:16.598 --> 01:22:18.965
Yeah, it was cozy, wasn't it?

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:21.054
Aw.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.138
What will your next chapter be?

01:22:26.608 --> 01:22:29.191
I was thinking of going to Thailand.

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.652
Maybe Bangkok,

01:22:31.738 --> 01:22:33.104
or Phuket.

01:22:35.826 --> 01:22:36.942
Phuket.

01:22:37.327 --> 01:22:39.319
No, that's not how you say it.

01:22:47.087 --> 01:22:48.498
What's this?

01:22:48.714 --> 01:22:51.252
<i>It's your cut of the
Lord of the Rings con.</i>

01:22:51.633 --> 01:22:52.919
Ooh.

01:22:53.010 --> 01:22:54.751
Minus expenses, of course.

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:57.838
Wardrobe, catering,
prosthetics, et cetera.

01:22:58.182 --> 01:23:00.390
And the cost of the
vases that you broke.

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:02.470
And the plumbing issues I caused.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:03.644
What?

01:23:03.854 --> 01:23:05.061
Hmm?

01:23:15.657 --> 01:23:17.114
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:23:23.373 --> 01:23:26.081
Yello! Make a hole, people. Make a hole.

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.579
'Scuse me, comin' through.

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:29.327
Come on, Ritchie comin' through, baby.

01:23:29.421 --> 01:23:31.879
'Scuse me, 'scuse me.
Thank you very much.

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:34.214
Okay, yeah. Thank you very much.

01:23:34.301 --> 01:23:36.167
All right. Okay.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:37.593
Intros.

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:41.047
Cathy! Cathy, baby, you get that
rock-hard caboose up here this minute.

01:23:41.141 --> 01:23:42.302
Ritchie, slow down!

01:23:42.643 --> 01:23:44.179
I have to catch my breath.

01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:46.977
Oh, shut it, doll. You're in
mint condition and you know it.

01:23:47.064 --> 01:23:49.522
Okay, so here's the story.

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:53.109
I was showing Cathy here
some luxury property in Capri,

01:23:53.195 --> 01:23:56.063
when I realized that this
lady's got some high-class taste.

01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:58.360
And I don't just mean
for real estate, nope.

01:23:58.492 --> 01:24:00.324
Cathy's an animal lover, see...

01:24:00.452 --> 01:24:02.865
But she doesn't just like
regular doggies and birdies.

01:24:03.163 --> 01:24:06.577
She likes special furry
friends who are maybe... Oh!

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:08.499
...a little illegal.
Is that right, Cathy?

01:24:08.585 --> 01:24:10.872
Yes, it is. Now, Cathy, what
is it you wanted to start?

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:12.836
It was a monastery or something?

01:24:12.923 --> 01:24:16.633
A rare animal sanctuary
and spa. I love it.

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:19.593
So I say to Cathy, "You'll
have to meet my friends."

01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:21.171
We hopped in the dinghy,

01:24:21.265 --> 01:24:23.222
we set sail, and here we are!

01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:26.681
Cathy, I want y'all
to meet South Africa's

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:30.309
most celebrated and discreet
endangered species dealer,

01:24:30.649 --> 01:24:32.686
Imka Bekker.

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:42.734
Say, what's wrong, Imka?

01:24:42.953 --> 01:24:44.819
Exotic cat got your tongue?

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.954
No. Howzit, Cathy?

01:24:51.670 --> 01:24:54.629
It's such a pleasure to meet
a fellow wildlife enthusiast.

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.172
I love the springboks, myself.

01:24:56.466 --> 01:24:59.425
Me, too. Me, too. Look at
me being a total jackass.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:02.299
I forgot to introduce
Imka's right-hand woman.

01:25:02.723 --> 01:25:03.884
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:25:03.974 --> 01:25:07.433
if y'all ever need a crocodile
just wrestled into submission,

01:25:07.728 --> 01:25:09.765
Sheila Malarkey is your gal.

01:25:11.565 --> 01:25:14.273
Oh, but Sheila lost
her tongue tragically

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:18.983
to a very small but
ferocious red-crested wombat.

01:25:20.198 --> 01:25:21.484
God bless her soul.

01:25:22.659 --> 01:25:23.945
Shame.

01:25:24.828 --> 01:25:27.195
She can sign, though. Can't you, Sheila?

01:25:29.124 --> 01:25:30.124
Yes.

01:25:31.501 --> 01:25:33.367
Yes, she can.

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:41.168
Okey-dokey. Yoh. Okay, okay.

01:25:41.595 --> 01:25:42.595
What's she saying?

01:25:42.679 --> 01:25:44.966
Okey-dokey. She says, everyone, please,

01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:49.009
up to the house and, please,
enjoy some of her ice cream.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:51.644
That's right, ladies and
gentlemen. Who likes ice cream?

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:54.765
I scream, you scream. Everybody
follow me, ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:54.900 --> 01:25:56.812
We're headin' up this
stone path, right here.

01:25:56.902 --> 01:25:59.019
Cathy, take this.
Everybody, look at Cathy.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.897
She's the alpha dog. I want you
to follow her all the way up.

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:04.510
Keep going! At the top, you're
gonna find a little penguin man.

01:26:04.534 --> 01:26:06.571
He's gonna spark the fuse
on the barbecue, baby.

01:26:06.662 --> 01:26:08.745
'Cause we're havin' red meat, baby!

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:22.963
This year I made $6 million.

01:26:23.637 --> 01:26:24.637
So far.

01:26:25.138 --> 01:26:26.299
Impressive.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:28.298
How irritating.

01:26:28.475 --> 01:26:31.092
But together, we could
make so much more.

01:26:31.561 --> 01:26:33.518
So much more.

01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:36.723
You guys are fantastic at what you do.

01:26:37.150 --> 01:26:39.437
My nana would absolutely love you.

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:41.151
The three of us.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:43.984
That'd be one hell of a team.

01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:52.450
You played me.

01:26:52.541 --> 01:26:56.911
Penny, the only thing I
never lied about was you.

01:27:08.598 --> 01:27:09.679
Listen.

01:27:10.767 --> 01:27:12.929
First million pays us back.

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:15.595
The second million will be your apology.

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:18.102
Yeah, and if you ever
double-cross us again,

01:27:18.191 --> 01:27:20.183
I withhold sex for a whole year.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:22.063
Or six months.

01:27:22.154 --> 01:27:24.020
No, let's go with 24 hours.

01:27:24.865 --> 01:27:26.072
For like...

01:27:26.491 --> 01:27:29.905
Until midmorning, I will
not be open as a shop.

01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:31.493
You done? Okay.

01:27:31.705 --> 01:27:32.825
So don't cross us ever again.

01:27:33.123 --> 01:27:34.455
Deal.

01:27:34.541 --> 01:27:36.373
So, are we doin' this?

01:27:46.178 --> 01:27:47.794
Come on! They went down this way.

01:27:47.929 --> 01:27:48.929
Hurry up!

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:59.021
Damn it! We lost them.

01:27:59.107 --> 01:28:00.314
How could you lose them?

01:28:01.234 --> 01:28:03.942
How could you give 'em £200,000?

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:06.487
Uh, designer nipples are not cheap.

01:28:06.656 --> 01:28:08.989
Plus, that's like 500 American dollars.

01:28:09.075 --> 01:28:10.355
It really isn't. Hey! Hey, buddy!

01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:13.490
Did you see two women
run by here a minute ago?

01:28:13.955 --> 01:28:17.198
Oh. Yeah, with massive wads of cash?

01:28:17.417 --> 01:28:18.453
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:18.543 --> 01:28:19.543
They ran that way.

01:28:19.711 --> 01:28:20.827
Let's go!

01:28:21.505 --> 01:28:23.872
Come on! Radio for backup or somethin'.

01:28:35.185 --> 01:28:37.893
Lucky Christmas dress, you did it again.

01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:42.773
I must say, Penny.

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:45.563
These outfits are terribly clever.

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.733
Old but gold.

01:28:50.784 --> 01:28:52.525
Happy Christmas.

01:28:52.994 --> 01:28:55.281
Thomas, I got you a
present. Thank you, Santa.

01:28:55.413 --> 01:28:57.075
No. I'm still here.

01:32:28.585 --> 01:32:30.479
Hortense, is that what that's used for?

01:32:30.503 --> 01:32:32.119
I don't see any butter on that knife.

01:32:32.589 --> 01:32:35.957
Now, Enrique, you were saying that
even though you yourself have benefited

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:38.634
economically from
immigrating to America,

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:42.426
you don't feel any additional Guatemalans
should be allowed into Palm Beach?

01:32:42.515 --> 01:32:45.098
Yes, I believe we're at the
tipping point in this moment.

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:46.642
What ist thou looking at?

01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:48.769
Stop skulking in the corner.

01:32:49.314 --> 01:32:52.398
Thy had thy hand on Rosalind's bosom!

01:32:52.776 --> 01:32:54.108
Dost thou deny it?

01:32:54.194 --> 01:32:56.402
Oh. Sweet Hortense had her suitor's body

01:32:56.488 --> 01:32:58.195
exhumed the day after he was trampled.

01:32:59.115 --> 01:33:00.276
It's folly, though.

01:33:00.408 --> 01:33:01.761
The family will never accept him.

01:33:01.785 --> 01:33:03.697
You just don't like
him because he's black.

01:33:04.162 --> 01:33:06.825
Sister, may I please sing my song now?

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:08.558
Ooh, yes, of course, darling, of course.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:11.368
Hortense has written a song
to celebrate our engagement.

01:33:11.461 --> 01:33:12.827
Isn't that marvelous?

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:14.795
No, wait, I wanted the lute.

01:33:14.964 --> 01:33:16.250
It is the lute.

01:33:16.341 --> 01:33:17.377
Hmm.

01:33:19.803 --> 01:33:23.217
All right, this is a Hortense original.

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:34.727
<i>Wedding</i>

01:33:38.071 --> 01:33:39.071
<i>Death</i>

01:33:42.826 --> 01:33:45.489
She had the finest tutors,
but you can't teach talent.

01:33:47.539 --> 01:33:49.030
Bon appétit!
