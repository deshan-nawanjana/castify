did I do last night?"

Yep. Pretty wild,

We were really drunk,

about it, okay?

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:53.917

Never happened.

Never happened.

1074
01:05:56.086 --> 01:05:58.555
Fine. Let's just
forget about it.

It's not like
you two had sex.

1076
01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:04.028
Have you had sex?

1077
01:06:04.061 --> 01:06:06.063
Shut up, Cooper!
Jamie, relax.

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:09.566
Okay, fine.
I'll give it a rest.

your Frommer's?

looking at colleges
and visiting some friends.

1109
01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:42.186
But several days ago,
she suddenly
changed her mind.

01:08:42.219 --> 01:08:43.553
She would not tell me why.

1111

up her bag and left.

she's always been very
interested in the classics,

Greek and Roman literature
and history,

1120
01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:09.279
and she's always
enjoyed the ocean,

1121
01:09:09.313 --> 01:09:12.249
so she found a program that
combines all her interests.

1122

Okay, then I guess
we'll go to Rome, then.

Unfortunately, Mieke's only
in Rome for orientation.

Tomorrow her group boards
a boat and she'll be
gone for the summer.

then she gets on that boat
and she's gone.

through this, guys, but...

your parents,

I'll walk, I'll hitchhike,

Mieke somehow.

Right here.

1175
01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:25.642
The Vatican has been used
as a papal residence

One of our English-speaking

has called in sick.

these peoples also?

1188
01:13:07.884 --> 01:13:09.352
How big is Vatican City?

1189
01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:10.820
.5 square kilometers.

1190
01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:12.989
Who built the colonnades?

1191
01:13:13.022 --> 01:13:15.925
Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1656.

1192
01:13:15.959 --> 01:13:17.026
Where are the bathrooms?

1193
01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.962
Floors 2, 6 and 7.

1194
01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:22.265
Next I'll take you to where
the College of Cardinals
elects a new pope.

1195
01:13:22.298 --> 01:13:25.735
When this happens, white smoke
is sent up from the Vatican.

1196
01:13:25.769 --> 01:13:27.070
Mieke's gotta be
around here somewhere.

01:13:28.472 --> 01:13:29.673
Let's go.

1198
01:13:38.682 --> 01:13:41.217

Excuse me, miss.
What is this?

1202
01:13:48.692 --> 01:13:50.594
That is the bell
of San Marco.

1203
01:13:50.627 --> 01:13:52.996
When the Pope dies,
the Cardinal Vicar of Rome

1204
01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.765
rings this bell to notify
the people of Rome.

1205
01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:58.434
Next we will view
the Sistine Chapel.
Follow me, please.

Come on.

Which way did they go?

01:14:06.309 --> 01:14:08.512
That way. I'd stake
my reputation on it.

Oh, no. It's okay.
I'm Catholic.

1226
01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:58.728
Take it off, god damn it!

Cooper, not again!

1401
01:25:34.730 --> 01:25:36.098
(KNOCKING)

1402
01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:37.433
Hold on, this could be
my new roommate.

1403
01:25:44.507 --> 01:25:46.675
COOPER: What's the freak
look like?

1404
01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:49.578
Is he a dork or is he cool?
Better not be cooler than me.

1405
01:25:50.279 --> 01:25:51.447
COOPER: Is he bigger than me?

1406
01:25:52.515 --> 01:25:54.683
I just got your last email.
What are you doing here?

1407
01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:56.685
Going to college.

1408
01:25:58.221 --> 01:25:59.322
You're going to college here?

1409
01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:02.758
What dorm?
This one.

1410
01:26:03.492 --> 01:26:04.593
Room 214.

1411
01:26:08.931 --> 01:26:10.233
How is this possible?

1412
01:26:11.634 --> 01:26:13.336
I guess they thought
I was a guy.

1413
01:26:14.837 --> 01:26:17.240
Now who would be dumb enough
to make a mistake like that?

1414
01:26:26.515 --> 01:26:28.817
COOPER: Do I hear kissing?

1415
01:26:28.851 --> 01:26:31.320
Are you making out with
your new roommate, Scotty?

1416
01:26:31.887 --> 01:26:33.188
(GIGGLING)

1417
01:26:34.957 --> 01:26:35.791
COOPER: Scotty?

1418
01:26:36.325 --> 01:26:39.228
Scotty? Scotty!

1419
01:26:39.262 --> 01:26:42.130
* Scotty doesn't know
that Fiona and me

1420
01:26:42.164 --> 01:26:44.533
This happy ending
is bullshit.

1421
01:26:44.567 --> 01:26:47.636
When does the fairy get laid?
I'm outta here.

1422
01:26:47.670 --> 01:26:50.473
* Still she's on her knees
and Scotty doesn't know

1423
01:26:51.274 --> 01:26:53.542
* Oh, Scotty doesn't know

1424
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:56.845
Catchy tune.
Fuckin'-A, man.

1425
01:27:01.617 --> 01:27:04.653
* Fiona says
she's out shopping

1426
01:27:06.822 --> 01:27:11.594
* But she's under me
and I'm not stopping

1427
01:27:11.627 --> 01:27:14.062
(CHANTING) Scotty
doesn't know!
Scotty doesn't know!

1428
01:27:14.096 --> 01:27:16.765
Scotty doesn't know!

1429
01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:19.268
Hello, and welcome to

1430
01:27:19.302 --> 01:27:22.405
Amsterdam's finest and most
luxurious youth hostel.

1431
01:27:22.438 --> 01:27:23.772
Sounds great.

1432
01:27:23.806 --> 01:27:26.275
There is no bathroom,
nor is there one nearby.

1433
01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:30.446
* I can't believe
he's so trusting

1434
01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:33.649
(GIGGLES) Sorry.

1435
01:27:33.682 --> 01:27:35.984
* While I'm right
behind you thrusting

1436
01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:39.588
Get it?
She got it.

1437
01:27:39.622 --> 01:27:42.925
If you do not wish to have
your valuables stolen,

1438
01:27:42.958 --> 01:27:46.662
I suggest destroying them
or discarding them right now.

1439
01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:49.698
You can also try
hiding your valuables...

1440
01:27:50.299 --> 01:27:51.467
In your anus.

1441
01:27:52.134 --> 01:27:53.302
Drink?

1442
01:27:58.974 --> 01:28:00.776
I'm gonna rip away his pants
and look at his dick, okay?

1443
01:28:00.809 --> 01:28:03.612
(LAUGHING)
Ready? Quit. Shut up.

1444
01:28:03.646 --> 01:28:04.813
Sorry. I know
I fucked it up.

1445
01:28:06.415 --> 01:28:08.417
Yes! You take her hair...

1446
01:28:08.451 --> 01:28:12.287
And one strand at a time,
pull it out!

1447
01:28:12.321 --> 01:28:14.457
Use her
like a humping post!

1448
01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:17.025
Jenny, this is Europe.

1449
01:28:17.059 --> 01:28:19.027
They have orange juice ads
with lesbians and dildos.

1450
01:28:21.364 --> 01:28:22.731
ANNOUNCER: Hapi djus.

1451
01:28:24.567 --> 01:28:25.901
You got to show them
something they haven't seen.

1452
01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:31.073
* Fiona's got him
on the phone

1453
01:28:31.106 --> 01:28:33.776
* And she's trying
not to moan

1454
01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:37.513
* It's a three-way call
and he knows nothing

1455
01:28:37.546 --> 01:28:39.748
* Nothing
Scotty doesn't know

1456
01:28:39.782 --> 01:28:42.618
* Scotty doesn't know
Scotty doesn't know

1457
01:28:42.651 --> 01:28:46.288
Should a fire occur,
due to our faulty wiring,

1458
01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:51.093
or the fireworks
factory upstairs,
you will be incinerated,

1459
01:28:51.126 --> 01:28:54.363
along with the valuables
you have hidden
in your anus.

1460
01:28:54.397 --> 01:28:57.199
* So don't tell Scotty
Scotty doesn't know

1461
01:28:57.232 --> 01:28:58.701
* Really want to go

* The parking lot
why not?

1465
01:29:08.877 --> 01:29:11.346
* It's so cool
when you're on top

1466

(BUBBLING)
(GIGGLING)

1467
01:29:14.617 --> 01:29:16.952
* Life is so hard
'cause Scotty doesn't know

1468
01:29:16.985 --> 01:29:18.754
* Scotty doesn't know

1469
01:29:18.787 --> 01:29:21.824
Fuck off!
Get out of it,
you wankers!

1470
01:29:21.857 --> 01:29:25.494
Go on, you Gaelic fucking
garlic-breath tossers!

1471
01:29:25.528 --> 01:29:27.730
Piss off! Get in here
and say that, mate!

1472
01:29:27.763 --> 01:29:30.165
Come on! Fucking come
and have it!

1473
01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:32.167
You fucking beep?

1474
01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:35.037
We'll beep, you bastard,
all over your fucking nose!

1475
01:29:35.070 --> 01:29:36.371
Fuck off!

1476
01:29:36.405 --> 01:29:38.541
Go on, you French bastards!

1477
01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:41.143
Get on the other side
of the road, you pricks!

1478
01:29:41.176 --> 01:29:42.978
Go on out of it!

1479
01:29:43.011 --> 01:29:44.246
Fuck off!

1480
01:29:44.279 --> 01:29:45.448

No, keep rubbing it.
