00:01:05.498 --> 00:01:07.864
putting the lawyer himself
at the controls.

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:12.234
Listen, I'm going to take off, okay?
I'm gonna try and catch the 2:00 back.

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.603
You're leaving the seminar now?
It's not even intermission.

00:01:14.674 --> 00:01:18.235
- I don't think you can do that.
- No, it's fine. Just cover for me, okay?

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:20.575
- Get it all.
- I guess.

00:01:20.647 --> 00:01:23.377
- Listen, could we have your badge?
- Yeah.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.385
It's worth two free drinks
at the Meet and Greet.

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:42.593
Hello.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:45.832
I'm going to the airport.
I'm kind of in a hurry, too.

00:01:47.407 --> 00:01:49.272
Sir, your seat belt
seems to be broken.

00:01:49.342 --> 00:01:51.139
What do you recommend I do?

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:54.703
I recommend you stop being such a faggot.

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:57.240
You're in the back seat.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.050
Jesus.

00:02:01.754 --> 00:02:03.119

Hello?

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:37.278
Hey, boy.

00:03:37.383 --> 00:03:40.113
Good boy, Orson.
Where's Mommy?

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.819
Honey?

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.456
Heidi?

[woman moaning]

00:04:14.153 --> 00:04:15.120
Mitch!

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:20.153
What are you doing home?
You totally scared me!

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.752
I scared you?
Because for a second, I thought...

00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:26.423
I don't even want to say it.

00:04:26.499 --> 00:04:28.763
[moaning]

00:04:30.436 --> 00:04:31.733
Wow.

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:34.773
That's, like, pretty hard-core.

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.638
Yeah, I know.

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:40.145
No, I'm not judging.
Don't be embarrassed.

00:04:40.213 --> 00:04:43.307
This is a major turn-on.
Let's go with this.

00:04:43.383 --> 00:04:45.749
- Is this what you do when I'm gone?
- Mitch, wait.

00:04:45.852 --> 00:04:49.754
No, I mean, I do it myself every once
in a while, but to magazines.

00:04:49.822 --> 00:04:51.722
Okay, Mitch, we need to talk.

00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.315
- Hello!
- Aah!

00:04:53.393 --> 00:04:54.883
[couple screaming]

00:04:55.862 --> 00:04:56.920
[barking]

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.397
Be honest.

00:04:59.465 --> 00:05:02.559
Please tell me this is the first time
this has happened.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:07.596
Well, do you want me to be honest, or you
want me to tell you this is the first time?

00:05:07.674 --> 00:05:11.610
- Jesus, what is wrong with you?
- Nothing is wrong with me!

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:13.646
I've tried to tell you about this.

00:05:13.713 --> 00:05:15.647
What? When?

00:05:16.549 --> 00:05:18.949
- All the time!
- Like when?

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:23.116
- Like, when we're in bed and stuff.
- In bed?

00:05:24.324 --> 00:05:26.724
I thought you were just talking dirty.

00:05:26.793 --> 00:05:29.990
I was, but I was being serious.

00:05:33.566 --> 00:05:36.228
You've said some really sick stuff.

00:05:36.302 --> 00:05:37.599
You have to admit it,

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:41.265
we haven't exactly been living the most
exciting lives in the world.

00:05:41.341 --> 00:05:44.777
This is a totally different kind
of satisfaction for me.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:46.471
It's purely sexual.

00:05:46.546 --> 00:05:48.639
Ooh!

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.584
[crying]
I'm really sorry.

00:05:55.621 --> 00:05:57.282
[doorbell rings]

00:06:04.397 --> 00:06:05.227
Hello.

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:06.492
Yeah?

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.861
I'm here for the gang bang.

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:11.230

[church bell rings]
[pipe organ playing]

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:17.132
You look a little pale, Mitch.
You need to breathe.

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:19.404
Let a little blood up in your face there,
will ya?

00:06:19.478 --> 00:06:22.504
- I don't want to breathe.
- You should be proud of yourself.

00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:26.312
Do you have any idea how hard it is to land
a girl as sexually enlightened as Heidi is?

00:06:26.385 --> 00:06:29.183
A girl like that comes around, what,
once every hundred years?

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:31.519
I wasn't looking for a girl like that.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.753
Columbus wasn't looking for America,
but that seemed to work out for everybody.

00:06:35.527 --> 00:06:37.654
You're here.
You know what I mean?

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.222
Hey, I just want to thank you
one last time for being here.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.961
It's the best day ever.

00:06:43.035 --> 00:06:46.630
Don't even start with me, Franklin, okay?
You need to walk away from this ASAP.

00:06:46.705 --> 00:06:49.333
- What?
- You need to get out, Frankie.

00:06:49.408 --> 00:06:53.003
[wedding march plays]

00:06:56.315 --> 00:06:59.807
This is it. It's now or never. You need
to get out of here while you're still single.

00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:03.912
- I'm not single.
- She's 30 yards away, you're single now.

00:07:03.989 --> 00:07:07.857
Come on, Marissa's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:10.395
Why don't you give that six months.
You don't think that'll change?

00:07:10.462 --> 00:07:12.487
I got a wife, kids.

00:07:12.564 --> 00:07:15.431
Do I seem like a happy guy to you,
Frankie?

00:07:15.901 --> 00:07:18.426
There's my wife. See that?

00:07:18.504 --> 00:07:21.473
Always smiling? Hi, honey.
Judging, watching, "Look at the baby."

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:24.202
She's coming down the aisle, Beanie.
Let it go.

00:07:26.845 --> 00:07:30.042
Let me be the first to say
congratulations to you then.

00:07:30.115 --> 00:07:33.881
You get one vagina for the rest of your life.
Real smart. Way to work it through.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:37.411
- [Mitch:] Don't listen to him.
- [Frank:] I need my inhaler.

00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:42.252
It takes a man to give away an angel.
You're a sweetheart.

00:07:42.328 --> 00:07:44.353
You look beautiful.

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:45.761
Great.

00:07:49.101 --> 00:07:50.432
Dearly beloved,

00:07:50.502 --> 00:07:52.629
we are gathered here together

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:55.299
to join Franklin and Marissa...

00:07:55.374 --> 00:07:56.739
Don't do it!

00:07:58.110 --> 00:07:59.839
[coughs loudly]

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.672
My throat is dry.
I'm sorry.

00:08:03.315 --> 00:08:04.612
I'm a smoker.

00:08:05.217 --> 00:08:06.514
Okay.

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:07.950
# Turn around

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:10.989
# Every now and then
I get a little bit lonely

00:08:11.056 --> 00:08:14.822
# And you're never coming round
Turn around

00:08:14.893 --> 00:08:18.226
# Every now and then
I get a little bit tired

00:08:18.297 --> 00:08:22.165
# Of listening to the sound of my tears

I get a little bit terrified

# I see the fuckin' look in your eyes
Turn around, bright eyes

# Fuckin' every now and then
I fall apart

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:49.221
# And I need you now tonight

00:08:49.294 --> 00:08:52.661
# I fuckin' need you more than ever

[singing off key]
# Look in your eye

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:59.230
# And then I fall apart
I need you more than ever

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:00.236
Mitch Martin?

00:09:01.006 --> 00:09:02.234
Yeah.

00:09:06.311 --> 00:09:07.573
Nicole!

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.414
My God!

00:09:10.482 --> 00:09:12.746
This is crazy!

00:09:12.818 --> 00:09:15.116
I can't believe it's you!

00:09:17.656 --> 00:09:18.748
God.

00:09:19.758 --> 00:09:22.454
- What are you doing here?
- I was invited.

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:29.232
The last time that I had heard,
you had moved to...

00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:31.098
- What do you call it?
- Denver.

00:09:31.737 --> 00:09:33.671
The Sunshine State.

00:09:33.739 --> 00:09:35.001
Denver!

00:09:35.074 --> 00:09:37.508
Gorgeous!
Gorgeous!

00:09:40.546 --> 00:09:41.740
Oh, boy.

00:09:42.548 --> 00:09:44.175
Are you okay?

00:09:44.249 --> 00:09:45.648
No, I'm...

00:09:45.717 --> 00:09:48.311
Yeah, I just feel a little...

00:09:49.688 --> 00:09:50.950
fucked up.

00:09:51.390 --> 00:09:54.882
Yeah, Marissa told me about your
girlfriend. I'm very sorry.

00:09:57.529 --> 00:10:01.295
The thing about that one is,
is it's not just that.

00:10:01.834 --> 00:10:04.667
It's a combination of things.

00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:07.500
We had a dog,
we had a great place,

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:10.565
but all just...
[deflating noise]

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:14.840
You know what?
I think you should have some of this.

00:10:14.913 --> 00:10:17.381
- What's in this one?
- Coffee.

00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:21.413
[slurping]

00:10:21.687 --> 00:10:24.986
[laughing, then screams]
Ow! Oww! Jesus!

00:10:25.524 --> 00:10:28.721
- I am so sorry! Please, just...
- No, don't touch!

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:31.354
- I can fix it. Just...
- Mitch, really.

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:35.025
- No, Mitch!
- What are you doing to this poor girl?

00:10:35.100 --> 00:10:37.466
Mitch, stop it!
I got it.

00:10:37.536 --> 00:10:40.130
No. Inappropriate.
Stop it right now.

00:10:40.205 --> 00:10:42.196
- Sweetie, there's a bathroom over here.
- Thank you.

00:10:42.274 --> 00:10:44.640
Mitch, honey? Hon?

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:46.701
Why don't you go get some air, okay?
Walk it off.

00:10:46.778 --> 00:10:48.643
No, wait a second.

00:10:48.714 --> 00:10:50.181
Yeah?

00:10:50.249 --> 00:10:53.309
- Put in a good word for me.
- Yeah, okay.

00:10:54.486 --> 00:10:58.115
[yodeling]
# Lay, oh-de-lay, oh-de-lay hee hoo!

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:03.787
# Sparkling, clear and lovely

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:05.688
# You're my

00:11:06.765 --> 00:11:08.756
# Lady

00:11:09.501 --> 00:11:11.765
Hey, Marissa!

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:13.702
You're the lady.

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:17.465
[applause, clinking glasses]

00:11:27.052 --> 00:11:28.713
Can't hear you!

00:11:29.888 --> 00:11:30.877
Excuse me.

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:34.983
I'd like to say I'm really glad
and proud to be here tonight.

00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:40.488
I'm glad to see Frank's dad made it out.
I haven't seen him in eight years.

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:42.397
That's great.
Congratulations.

00:11:42.467 --> 00:11:44.492
I love you, Dad!

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:47.232
True love is hard to find.

00:11:47.306 --> 00:11:49.399
Sometimes you think you have true love,

00:11:49.474 --> 00:11:52.841
and then you catch the early flight
home from San Diego,

00:11:52.911 --> 00:11:56.142
and a couple of nude people
jump out of your bathroom blindfolded

00:11:56.215 --> 00:12:00.311
Iike a goddamn magic show,
ready to double-team your girlfriend...

00:12:00.385 --> 00:12:04.151
It stops right there
and it continues right here,

00:12:04.223 --> 00:12:07.590
because I think what Mitch is trying to say
is that true love is blind.

00:12:09.494 --> 00:12:11.860
Let's raise our glasses,
whatever we got in front of us.

00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:13.921
Salute. Health and happiness.

00:12:14.533 --> 00:12:15.864
Cheers, everybody.

00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:19.403
I love you so much, Frankie.
I love you.

00:12:19.471 --> 00:12:21.336
I'm not a talker.

00:12:21.406 --> 00:12:23.704
I love you.
Congratulations.

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:48.124
I thought you said near campus.
This is practically on-campus. It's sick.

00:12:48.201 --> 00:12:50.396
- This is great.
- How did you land this place?

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:52.370
I don't know, it was pretty easy, actually.

00:12:52.438 --> 00:12:56.067
A professor lived here for, like,
30 years, and then he died.

00:12:56.175 --> 00:12:57.506
That's awesome!

00:12:59.379 --> 00:13:00.971
That's awesome.

00:13:01.047 --> 00:13:03.311
A little housewarming.

00:13:03.383 --> 00:13:05.317
To new beginnings.

00:13:06.753 --> 00:13:07.845
Thanks.

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:13.325
Actually, I gave this to you
for your wedding.

00:13:14.861 --> 00:13:16.658
This model?

00:13:16.729 --> 00:13:19.061
No, this exact one.

00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.865
I'm sorry.

00:13:21.934 --> 00:13:23.868
I'm embarrassed.
I'm sorry.

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:25.164
It's okay.

00:13:25.238 --> 00:13:26.967
I hope you like it.

00:13:27.607 --> 00:13:30.041
I love it.
Thank you.

00:13:30.109 --> 00:13:32.100
This place is unbelievable.

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:34.237
- You like it?
- How could you still be depressed?

00:13:34.314 --> 00:13:37.715
This is the probably the best thing
that's ever happened to us.

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:39.376
- Us?
- Yeah, us.

00:13:39.452 --> 00:13:42.319
Do not get selfish on me here, okay?
Now stay with me.

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:44.322
You put a bar in over there, right?

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:48.588
Couple La-Z-Boys to fill it out, a smarter
couch. You could put a hot tub anywhere.

00:13:48.661 --> 00:13:50.390
Max, can you earmuff it for me?

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:54.462
We're gonna get so much ass here,
it's gonna be sick.

00:13:54.534 --> 00:13:56.593
I'm talking crazy, boy-band ass.

00:13:56.669 --> 00:13:58.967
That sounds like a lot of fun, but

00:13:59.038 --> 00:14:02.030
I need a little time to get
my life back together.

00:14:02.108 --> 00:14:04.975
We need to throw a big
kick-ass party to start things off.

00:14:05.044 --> 00:14:08.309
Absolutely.
Break it in a little, meet the neighbors.

00:14:08.381 --> 00:14:10.315
Come on, Mitch.
You know what I'm talking about.

00:14:10.383 --> 00:14:11.645
Break it in.

00:14:11.718 --> 00:14:15.176
The real estate guy was really
adamant about not having...

00:14:15.254 --> 00:14:18.155
I don't think you realize what
a huge opportunity this is for you.

00:14:18.224 --> 00:14:20.920
Girls love a guy who's in your
particular situation.

00:14:20.993 --> 00:14:22.153
What situation?

00:14:22.228 --> 00:14:24.287
Mitch, you're on the rebound.

00:14:24.364 --> 00:14:26.730
You're like an injured fawn
nursed back to health,

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.632
who's finally gonna be rereleased
into the wilderness.

00:14:29.702 --> 00:14:31.260
[glass breaking]
Sorry.

00:14:31.337 --> 00:14:32.929
[baby crying]
Please be careful.

00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:35.667
- I'm sorry. You okay?
- Don't say sorry to me, say it to the baby.

00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:37.334
- You upset him.
- Sorry, baby.

00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:39.310
It's okay. It happens.

00:14:39.379 --> 00:14:41.677
We should go tropical with this thing.

00:14:41.748 --> 00:14:45.013
Like sand from wall to wall. I know a great
sand guy, we'll get it at price.

00:14:45.084 --> 00:14:46.142
Sand in here?

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.813
Or foam, whatever.
Something in here.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:51.516
- You understand what I'm talking about?
- Absolutely.

00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:54.185
I'm good either way.
Just need to run it by Marissa.

00:14:56.796 --> 00:14:58.787
I'm messing with you guys!
It's a joke!

00:14:58.865 --> 00:15:00.264
[baby cries]

00:15:00.333 --> 00:15:02.233
It's not funny.
And now the baby is upset.

00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:04.326
[loud music]

00:15:04.404 --> 00:15:06.964
[engine revs]

00:15:08.808 --> 00:15:12.437
[music continues]

00:15:12.512 --> 00:15:14.742
[shouts:] Hey!

00:15:17.417 --> 00:15:18.076
Hey!

00:15:18.818 --> 00:15:20.479
Hey, honey!

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.581
I brought you an iced tea!

00:15:22.655 --> 00:15:24.885
No, thanks. I got a fresh beer.

00:15:24.991 --> 00:15:27.152
Can you turn that off for a second?

00:15:28.895 --> 00:15:30.886
[music stops]
[engine sputters]

00:15:30.963 --> 00:15:34.126
Wow. That's really loud.

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.531
Yeah. Thanks.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:38.729
I took the restrictor plate off,
give the Red Dragon a little more juice.

00:15:38.805 --> 00:15:43.037
But let's keep that on the down low.
She's not exactly street legal.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.269
Hey, Mike!

00:15:44.343 --> 00:15:45.469
Right.

00:15:45.545 --> 00:15:48.605
- So, what's up?
- Nothing much.

00:15:48.681 --> 00:15:51.514
I was hoping we might get to those
thank you notes tomorrow night.

00:15:51.584 --> 00:15:54.109
Honey, I got Mitch's thing tomorrow night.

00:15:54.187 --> 00:15:56.519
Oh, that's right.
I totally forgot.

00:15:56.589 --> 00:15:58.352
But I can skip it.

00:15:58.424 --> 00:16:00.449
Oh! No.

00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:03.023
Don't be silly.

00:16:03.095 --> 00:16:06.963
I mean, I wouldn't want you changing
your whole life just for me.

00:16:08.334 --> 00:16:10.700
I'll give Lara a call
and we'll plan a girls' night.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:13.068
- lt'll be fun.
- Thanks.

00:16:13.139 --> 00:16:14.868
You're the best.

00:16:15.675 --> 00:16:17.768
Just as long as you promise to take it easy,
you know.

00:16:17.844 --> 00:16:21.109
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

00:16:21.814 --> 00:16:25.215
You've come a long way since Frank the
Tank, and we don't want him coming back.

00:16:25.318 --> 00:16:28.879
Honey, Frank the Tank
is not coming back, okay?

00:16:28.955 --> 00:16:32.083
That part of me is over.
It's water under the bridge.

00:16:32.158 --> 00:16:33.785
I promise.

00:16:43.535 --> 00:16:46.197
[crowd cheering]

00:16:47.472 --> 00:16:48.666
Nice, right?

00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:50.674
This is incredible.
How did you do this?

00:16:50.742 --> 00:16:53.336
With all the people here,
and the speakers.

00:16:53.412 --> 00:16:55.880
I thought we were having
a small get-together.

00:16:55.948 --> 00:16:58.610
It's one of many
small get-togethers.

00:16:58.684 --> 00:17:00.584
That's why you got the house, brother.

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:02.176
You're having fun?

00:17:02.254 --> 00:17:04.779
- I'm having a great time.
- Good.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:08.850
What else have you got planned?
A student band or something?

00:17:08.927 --> 00:17:10.258
Yeah, that's it.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:13.765
I got a student alt rock band
coming on stage next.

00:17:13.832 --> 00:17:15.459
I own six Speaker Cities.

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:18.367
I'm worth $3.5 million,
that the government knows about.

00:17:18.437 --> 00:17:21.372
I got more electronics up there
than a damn KlSS concert.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.809
You think I'd roll out that kind of red carpet
for a fuckin' marching band?

00:17:25.878 --> 00:17:27.368
Just make sure you can see the stage.

00:17:27.913 --> 00:17:29.847
Excuse me. Pardon me.

00:17:29.915 --> 00:17:33.112
I just want to get through this door,
if you don't mind.

00:17:33.185 --> 00:17:34.345
Thank you.

00:17:34.419 --> 00:17:37.149
This is the guy I was talking about.
This is his house.

00:17:37.222 --> 00:17:40.658
- What's up, man?
- No, that's my friend, Mitch.

00:17:40.726 --> 00:17:43.194
My friend Mitch, he owns the house.

00:17:43.262 --> 00:17:46.959
Anyway, come hit this right here.
You need to hit this.

00:17:47.032 --> 00:17:50.661
No, I appreciate it, but I told my wife
I wouldn't drink tonight.

00:17:51.236 --> 00:17:54.501
Besides, I've got a big day tomorrow.
But you guys have a great time.

00:17:54.573 --> 00:17:57.064
A big day? Doing what?

00:17:57.142 --> 00:18:00.043
Well, actually,
pretty nice little Saturday.

00:18:00.112 --> 00:18:01.704
We're going to Home Depot.

00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:05.243
Buy some wallpaper,
maybe get some flooring.

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.276
Stuff like that. Maybe Bed, Bath
and Beyond, I don't know.

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:10.844
I don't know if we'll have enough time.

00:18:13.325 --> 00:18:16.317
You know what? Give me that thing.
I'll do one.

00:18:16.395 --> 00:18:19.626
He gonna do one!
He gonna do one!

00:18:24.236 --> 00:18:26.431
That's a talented man right there.

00:18:30.208 --> 00:18:32.642
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Fill it up again!

00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:35.942
God, that's good.
It's so good!

00:18:36.014 --> 00:18:38.608
Once it hits your lips,
it's so good.

00:18:38.784 --> 00:18:42.242
Thank you very much, guys. This will be
happening at this house all year.

00:18:42.321 --> 00:18:44.380
So just get ready,
don't burn yourselves out tonight.

00:18:44.456 --> 00:18:48.324
I wanna thank you very much for coming to
the official Mitch Martin Freedom Festival.

00:18:52.297 --> 00:18:54.697
For those who don't know
who Mitch Martin is,

00:18:54.766 --> 00:18:56.893
he's the very successful,

00:18:56.969 --> 00:19:00.063
very disease-free gentleman
standing by the mini-bar.

00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:06.938
Now, courtesy of Speaker City,

00:19:07.012 --> 00:19:10.778
which is slashing prices on everything
from beepers to DVD players,

00:19:10.849 --> 00:19:15.183
give a warm Harrison University
welcome to my pal

00:19:15.253 --> 00:19:18.814
and your favorite,
Mister Snoop Dogg.

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:20.653
[crowd cheering]

00:19:23.695 --> 00:19:25.959
# Yeah
Get up

00:19:26.765 --> 00:19:28.733
# You know what

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:30.802
# I'm thinking of a master plan

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:33.697
# Cuz ain't nothing but sweat
Inside my hand

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:36.070
# So I dig into my pockets
All my money is spent

00:19:36.141 --> 00:19:38.371
# So I dig deeper
But still coming up with lint

00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:40.934
# So I start my mission
Leave my residence

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.447
# I'm thinkin' how can I get
Some dead presidents

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.450
[crowd cheering]
Frank! Frank!

00:19:48.787 --> 00:19:49.981
Whoo!

00:19:56.061 --> 00:19:57.892
Frank the Tank!

00:19:57.963 --> 00:20:00.659
Frank the Tank!

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:03.995
You know it!

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:05.730
You know it!

00:20:10.575 --> 00:20:12.873
# A pen and a paper
A stereo, a tape

00:20:12.944 --> 00:20:17.472
[rapping, indistinct]

00:20:17.816 --> 00:20:19.283
You're that guy.

00:20:19.351 --> 00:20:20.340
What?

00:20:20.419 --> 00:20:22.353
Mitch-a-Palooza, from the poster.

00:20:22.421 --> 00:20:23.854
Yeah, that's me.

00:20:23.922 --> 00:20:26.356
This party is great.
Nice work.

00:20:26.425 --> 00:20:28.791
My friends put it on for me.

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.387
They're kind of rereleasing me
out into the wild.

00:20:32.464 --> 00:20:34.728
What are you talking about?

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.358
Nothing. Sorry.

00:20:36.435 --> 00:20:41.031
# Got to have some thangs
So what you need is some game

00:20:41.106 --> 00:20:43.870
- # Say what
- # To get your paper, man

00:20:43.942 --> 00:20:46.672
- # Say what, say what, yeah
- # Oh, baby

00:20:46.745 --> 00:20:49.111
- # In a world of paper
- # Check me out, y'all

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:52.275
# Did somebody say make money money
Make money money money

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:54.545
# Make money money
Make money money money

00:20:54.619 --> 00:20:57.452
# Say make money money
Make money money money

00:20:57.522 --> 00:20:59.422
[crowd repeats]

00:21:01.226 --> 00:21:03.717
We're going streaking!

00:21:04.596 --> 00:21:06.359
[microphone squeals]

00:21:06.431 --> 00:21:08.991
[screams, disgusted groans]

00:21:09.267 --> 00:21:10.325
I'm sorry.

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:15.567
We're going streaking through the quad
and into the gymnasium.

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:16.971
Come on, everybody!

00:21:17.042 --> 00:21:18.600
Come on, Snoop!

00:21:19.411 --> 00:21:20.400
Snoop-a-loop!

00:21:20.479 --> 00:21:21.468
Snoop!

00:21:21.847 --> 00:21:23.940
No, it's cool. I'm cool.

00:21:24.015 --> 00:21:25.949
Bring your green hat. Let's go.

00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:28.417
Come on, everybody, we're going!

00:21:28.487 --> 00:21:29.977
Here we go!

00:21:30.055 --> 00:21:32.819
Man, man.
Man, put the music back on.

00:21:32.891 --> 00:21:35.451
Let's get
the party back cracking up in here.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:36.289
[crowd cheers]

00:21:36.361 --> 00:21:39.023
Whoo! Come on!

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:41.361
We're streaking.
Come on!

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:44.163
Come on, every...
We're... come on!

00:21:44.236 --> 00:21:46.966
Whoo! Whoo!

00:21:47.038 --> 00:21:50.405
We're streaking.
We're streaking!

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:52.500
Whooo!

00:21:52.577 --> 00:21:54.238
Come on!

00:21:55.614 --> 00:21:56.706
Oh, tell her!

00:21:57.182 --> 00:21:58.649
Marissa, I totally forgot.

00:21:58.717 --> 00:22:03.017
I know it's a little belated, but we got you
the perfect wedding present!

00:22:03.088 --> 00:22:06.182
Come on, you guys, I told you,
you don't have to get me anything.

00:22:06.258 --> 00:22:10.194
Our friend Ashley had this guy come over
and teach a blow job class.

00:22:10.495 --> 00:22:12.929
- It was incredible.
- A class?

00:22:12.998 --> 00:22:15.796
And he's really good,
so we had to book him way in advance.

00:22:15.867 --> 00:22:17.494
Why should I go to a class?

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:21.403
Bernard should be the one going to class.
I swear, the man is orally challenged.

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:25.771
- Wait a second, is that guy...
- [Frank whooping]

00:22:25.844 --> 00:22:27.675
Oh, my God.

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.246
That's disgusting!

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:34.015
Why am I looking at that?

00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:36.647
Why are you slowing down?

00:22:36.721 --> 00:22:39.485
Just drive. Go.
[horns honking]

00:22:40.258 --> 00:22:41.247
Frank?

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.689
No way.

00:22:45.864 --> 00:22:46.853
Frank!

00:22:47.666 --> 00:22:49.156
Hey, honey.

00:22:50.302 --> 00:22:52.327
What the hell are you doing?

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:56.500
We're streaking. We're going up
through the quad to the gymnasium.

00:22:57.409 --> 00:22:59.240
Who's streaking?

00:22:59.311 --> 00:23:01.142
There's more coming.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.780
Frank, get in the car.

00:23:03.848 --> 00:23:05.748
- Everybody's doing it.
- Now!

00:23:05.817 --> 00:23:06.806
Okay.

00:23:12.123 --> 00:23:14.683
Whoa! Scooch over.

00:23:19.931 --> 00:23:21.592
Hey, ladies.

00:23:21.866 --> 00:23:25.324
Hey, Frank.
Looks like it's a little cold out there, huh?

00:23:25.403 --> 00:23:28.099
[girls giggling]

00:23:28.473 --> 00:23:29.963
Please, guys.

00:23:30.442 --> 00:23:32.239
Honey, do you think KFC is still open?

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.211
[girls laughing]

00:23:38.751 --> 00:23:41.982
[lawn mower]

00:23:42.054 --> 00:23:44.113
[alarm buzzes]

00:23:49.995 --> 00:23:51.929
Oh, shit.

00:23:55.167 --> 00:23:56.657
Good morning.

00:23:58.137 --> 00:24:00.128
Now, that was a party.

00:24:03.709 --> 00:24:06.075
Since when are you so shy?

00:24:06.145 --> 00:24:07.908
No, I'm not.
I just...

00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:11.472
Did I snore last night?
Sometimes I snore when I'm drunk.

00:24:12.318 --> 00:24:14.912
I don't remember.

00:24:14.987 --> 00:24:17.046
I don't think so.

00:24:19.024 --> 00:24:21.788
Listen, about last night.

00:24:22.695 --> 00:24:27.029
I just got out of a very serious
and traumatic relationship.

00:24:28.267 --> 00:24:31.031
I'm kind of in a weird place right now.

00:24:32.004 --> 00:24:33.335
What?

00:24:33.405 --> 00:24:35.703
Relax, Rich, it's not a big deal.

00:24:36.709 --> 00:24:39.439
Mitch, with an "M."

00:24:40.546 --> 00:24:42.673
Right. Look.

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:47.985
Whatever. We were just having a little fun.
You have nothing to worry about.

00:24:48.053 --> 00:24:49.350
No.

00:24:49.421 --> 00:24:51.889
Yeah, you're right.
I'm okay with it.

00:24:51.957 --> 00:24:54.221
It's casual. I was just...

00:24:54.293 --> 00:24:57.023
I got to go to class, so...

00:24:57.096 --> 00:25:00.361
So, how do we do this? Shall l...

00:25:00.432 --> 00:25:02.525
You want to leave me your number?

00:25:02.601 --> 00:25:05.263
You don't even have to worry about it.

00:25:09.108 --> 00:25:11.008
See you around.

00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:14.738
Bye.

00:25:16.815 --> 00:25:18.043
I love you.

00:25:18.117 --> 00:25:21.917
At Speaker City, we're slashing prices
on everything from DVD players

00:25:21.987 --> 00:25:24.080
to camcorders,
and everything in between.

00:25:24.156 --> 00:25:27.421
Our courteous staff will educate you
on a wide selection of state-of-the-art

00:25:27.493 --> 00:25:29.484
home theater equipment and accessories.

00:25:29.562 --> 00:25:32.156
Show us a competitor's price.
We'll beat it.

00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:35.997
If we can't beat it, I'll give you
the keys to the store. Literally.

00:25:36.068 --> 00:25:37.399
Figuratively, I mean.

00:25:37.469 --> 00:25:40.734
The only thing that sounds better
than our speakers are our prices!

00:25:40.806 --> 00:25:42.103
Hi, silly kid.

00:25:43.108 --> 00:25:45.975
What do you think? Honestly.
Shoot me straight.

00:25:46.045 --> 00:25:47.307
Really good.

00:25:47.379 --> 00:25:49.370
- You look great.
- Really?

00:25:51.116 --> 00:25:53.448
God, I went a little bit...

00:25:53.519 --> 00:25:55.851
Got crazy last night.

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:59.049
Yeah, I still haven't heard from Frank.
I'm a little worried.

00:25:59.124 --> 00:26:01.024
Hello?
[cans clink]

00:26:02.761 --> 00:26:04.592
Come on in. Jesus!

00:26:04.663 --> 00:26:06.631
Is this one of your guys here?

00:26:06.699 --> 00:26:09.463
- About three fire hazards over here.
- What are you doing, man?

00:26:13.606 --> 00:26:17.064
Cheese, is that you?

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:21.774
Hello, Mitch, Bernard.
I see you guys haven't changed much.

00:26:21.847 --> 00:26:22.814
Who is this?

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:25.111
Remember Cheese,
Rodney's kid brother?

00:26:25.184 --> 00:26:29.086
Actually, my name isn't Cheese anymore.
It's Gordon Pritchard.

00:26:29.154 --> 00:26:30.382
Oh, yeah!

00:26:30.456 --> 00:26:32.390
Cheese!

00:26:32.458 --> 00:26:34.983
Didn't we lock you in a dumpster one time?

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.618
I got out.

00:26:36.695 --> 00:26:39.721
Cool, man.
I'm glad you did.

00:26:42.101 --> 00:26:44.365
- You had a good time last night?
- Yeah.

00:26:44.436 --> 00:26:47.837
There might be some whippits
lying around if you want them.

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:50.431
- No, thanks. I'm working.
- Working what?

00:26:50.509 --> 00:26:51.669
Campus patrol?

00:26:52.544 --> 00:26:54.978
- Try again.
- You a Jehovah's Witness?

00:26:55.047 --> 00:26:56.844
- [Beanie and Gordon laugh]
- I'm the dean.

00:26:56.915 --> 00:26:58.940
Dean Pritchard. Yeah.

00:26:59.018 --> 00:27:02.146
And as of this morning,
this house has been rezoned.

00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:06.281
It is now exclusively
for campus use only.

00:27:06.358 --> 00:27:07.882
What are you talking about?

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:11.521
You can't just do that. I've already paid
the first and last month's rent!

00:27:11.597 --> 00:27:12.859
Take a look at that.

00:27:13.899 --> 00:27:17.699
You have a week to vacate the premises,
and I thank you for your cooperation.

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:19.067
Great.

00:27:19.405 --> 00:27:21.339
- Can I ask you a question?
- Absolutely not.

00:27:21.407 --> 00:27:24.899
It's been good seeing you guys.
It looks like you're doing great.

00:27:36.621 --> 00:27:38.885
Frank, this is a safe place.

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:42.893
It's a place where we can feel free
sharing our feelings.

00:27:42.961 --> 00:27:47.398
Think of my office as a nest
in a tree of trust and understanding.

00:27:47.465 --> 00:27:48.989
We can say anything here.

00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:50.993
Anything?

00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:55.566
It's okay, honey.
That's why we came.

00:27:59.010 --> 00:28:04.539
Well, I guess l...
Deep down I'm feeling a little confused.

00:28:05.217 --> 00:28:08.675
I mean, suddenly you get married

00:28:08.753 --> 00:28:11.313
and you're supposed
to be this entirely different guy.

00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:13.220
I don't feel different.

00:28:13.558 --> 00:28:16.083
Take yesterday, for example.

00:28:16.161 --> 00:28:20.222
We were out at the Olive Garden
for dinner, which was lovely.

00:28:20.298 --> 00:28:21.993
And...

00:28:22.067 --> 00:28:27.027
I happened to look over during the meal
and see a waitress taking an order,

00:28:27.105 --> 00:28:32.304
and I found myself wondering
what color her underpants might be.

00:28:33.211 --> 00:28:34.701
Her panties.

00:28:37.449 --> 00:28:42.113
Odds are they're probably
basic white, cotton underpants.

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:46.817
But I started thinking,
"Well, maybe they're silk panties."

00:28:46.892 --> 00:28:48.621
"Maybe it's a thong."

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:54.097
"Maybe it's something really cool
that I don't even know about."

00:28:54.165 --> 00:28:57.657
You know? And I started feeling...

00:28:58.069 --> 00:28:59.058
What?

00:28:59.804 --> 00:29:02.796
I thought we were in the trust tree,
in the nest. Are we not?

00:29:02.874 --> 00:29:05.570
- We are. It's okay.
- Okay?

00:29:06.645 --> 00:29:09.808
It's okay. Please continue.

00:29:10.248 --> 00:29:12.842
I don't know
where I was going with that.

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:18.451
I guess what I'm trying to say
is that now that I'm married,

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:22.323
I'm definitely feeling
a little freaked out about the fact

00:29:22.394 --> 00:29:26.558
that I'm gonna have sex
with only one person

00:29:28.133 --> 00:29:30.294
for the rest of my life.

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:34.766
Walsh tells me
your San Diego trip was a blast!

00:29:34.873 --> 00:29:36.135
Yeah.

00:29:36.207 --> 00:29:37.640
How was Hooters?

00:29:37.709 --> 00:29:39.768
I actually didn't go to Hooters.

00:29:39.844 --> 00:29:41.436
Yeah, right.

00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:42.980
Skittles?

00:29:43.048 --> 00:29:44.413
No, thanks.

00:29:44.482 --> 00:29:46.973
Listen. I got a call from Manetti.

00:29:47.052 --> 00:29:51.148
He tells me that your Sunshine Square
proposal is totally fucked.

00:29:51.222 --> 00:29:52.746
What's wrong with it?

00:29:52.824 --> 00:29:56.282
Well, for one thing, it violates
the zoning restrictions set forth

00:29:56.361 --> 00:29:59.990
in the National Historical
Preservation Act of 1 966.

00:30:00.065 --> 00:30:02.795
Most notably, clause four.

00:30:02.867 --> 00:30:04.129
Shall I continue?

00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:06.727
- Actually, I'm familiar with that item...
- Honey.

00:30:06.805 --> 00:30:08.796
- Hi, Dad, am I interrupting?
- No, come in.

00:30:10.375 --> 00:30:13.572
I don't think you've met my daughter.
Darcie, this is Mitch Martin.

00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:17.681
Nice to meet you, Mitch.

00:30:17.749 --> 00:30:19.774
Hi. Nice to meet you.

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:22.183
- How was the slumber party?
- Great. You know,

00:30:22.253 --> 00:30:24.414
movies and popcorn.

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.421
She's an angel.

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:30.726
It makes me sound an old man, but I can't
believe how fast she's growing up.

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:33.593
- Dad, stop.
- I'm sorry honey, but it's true.

00:30:33.665 --> 00:30:38.159
To think that in just seven months
you'll be graduating from high school!

00:30:38.236 --> 00:30:39.931
[coughs violently]

00:30:41.006 --> 00:30:42.837
You okay?

00:30:42.907 --> 00:30:44.841
I thought you said high school.

00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:46.900
Yeah.
Shocking, isn't it?

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:49.774
Yes, it is.

00:30:59.057 --> 00:31:00.354
Give me a break.

00:31:00.425 --> 00:31:02.017
Hey, Mitch.

00:31:05.964 --> 00:31:09.127
Hey, man. Did you have a good day?

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.031
Not too bad.

00:31:12.237 --> 00:31:13.670
What's going on?

00:31:13.738 --> 00:31:17.936
I thought maybe I could crash here
tonight, if that's all right.

00:31:18.009 --> 00:31:20.910
Marissa is going through
some personal stuff.

00:31:22.447 --> 00:31:26.850
Personal stuff like you running through
the neighborhood drunk and naked?

00:31:26.918 --> 00:31:30.479
That and some other stuff.

00:31:32.023 --> 00:31:33.957
No problem.
Make yourself at home.

00:31:34.025 --> 00:31:35.253
Thanks.

00:31:35.927 --> 00:31:36.562
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

00:31:36.562 --> 00:31:39.690
Gentlemen, we're discussing
a brand-new way to look at a fraternity.

00:31:39.765 --> 00:31:45.294
In other words, forget all the normal rules
that apply to both college and society,

00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.134
because this is a very big idea,
my friends.

00:31:48.206 --> 00:31:52.370
We are talking about a non-exclusive,
egalitarian brotherhood

00:31:52.444 --> 00:31:55.413
where community status
and more importantly, age,

00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:57.710
have no bearing whatsoever.

00:31:58.784 --> 00:32:00.979
Yeah? From the guy who probably
won't get in.

00:32:01.053 --> 00:32:03.749
- I go to school here.
- Okay.

00:32:03.822 --> 00:32:07.781
I was curious, what association
will you have with the actual university?

00:32:07.859 --> 00:32:09.986
- Who are these people?
- I don't know.

00:32:10.062 --> 00:32:13.395
Legally speaking,
there will be a loose affiliation,

00:32:13.465 --> 00:32:16.832
but we will give nothing back
to the academic community.

00:32:16.902 --> 00:32:20.861
As well as provide no public service
of any kind. This much I promise.

00:32:20.939 --> 00:32:23.169
What the hell is going on here?

00:32:23.241 --> 00:32:25.732
Guys, this is a very special occasion.

00:32:25.811 --> 00:32:29.770
The Godfather himself has been kind
enough to grace us with his presence.

00:32:29.848 --> 00:32:31.179
- The Godfather!
- [applause]

00:32:31.249 --> 00:32:34.582
This is his damn house.
He lives here, he sleeps 20 feet away.

00:32:36.888 --> 00:32:38.856
We need to talk.

00:32:39.124 --> 00:32:40.113
Kitchen.

00:32:41.193 --> 00:32:44.526
Sit good for me. I'm gonna talk
to Uncle Mitch for a second.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:46.388
There you go, buddy.

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:49.662
- How long have these people been here?
- All day.

00:32:49.735 --> 00:32:52.329
That party we had last night
has given us all kinds of street cred.

00:32:52.404 --> 00:32:54.167
What are you talking about?

00:32:54.239 --> 00:32:57.675
This is called "rush."
We're officially starting a fraternity.

00:32:57.743 --> 00:32:59.734
I like it. It's genius!

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:01.438
You've got to be kidding me.

00:33:01.513 --> 00:33:03.606
You heard Pritchard, all right?
We're obligated to do this.

00:33:03.682 --> 00:33:07.778
This house, he says, is zoned specifically
for social services and student housing.

00:33:07.853 --> 00:33:09.684
Fraternity solves both of those.

00:33:09.755 --> 00:33:12.451
But this is my house.
I live here, Beanie.

00:33:12.524 --> 00:33:15.857
I'm 30 years old.
None of us are enrolled in the college.

00:33:15.927 --> 00:33:19.590
I understand that. You're focused
on all the wrong sort of details.

00:33:19.665 --> 00:33:22.634
Did you or did you not
have a good time at the party?

00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:24.498
I had an awesome time.

00:33:24.903 --> 00:33:26.962
I know you had an awesome time.

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:29.507
The entire town knows
you had an awesome time.

00:33:29.574 --> 00:33:32.134
I'm trying to ask Mitch whether
he had an awesome time.

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.905
- I had a good time.
- Okay, that's good.

00:33:33.979 --> 00:33:36.004
Wouldn't you want those good times
to keep going?

00:33:36.081 --> 00:33:38.413
- More good...
- God. I mean...

00:33:38.483 --> 00:33:42.249
I don't understand. I don't know why it's
so hard for you to admit you want this.

00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.687
We got 40 guys that want this.
There must be a reason for it.

00:33:45.757 --> 00:33:48.021
Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm.

00:33:48.093 --> 00:33:51.995
I know you guys are trying to help,
but the truth of the matter is,

00:33:52.064 --> 00:33:55.898
I've had a hell of a day,
an even worse month.

00:33:55.967 --> 00:34:00.028
And the fact is,
I've got 40 strangers out in my living room

00:34:00.105 --> 00:34:02.835
and all I want to do is
get some fuckin' sleep.

00:34:02.908 --> 00:34:07.174
So, I'm sorry, but we're not
starting a fraternity.

00:34:07.245 --> 00:34:10.442
I don't know why you got to do it
in front of the kid, with the "F'ing."

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:12.608
All you got to do is
say "earmuffs" to him.

00:34:12.684 --> 00:34:14.709
Then you can say,
"fuck, shit, bitch," whatever you want.

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:16.117
Cock. Balls.

00:34:16.188 --> 00:34:18.986
I'm just proving a point.
You don't have to celebrate it, Frank.

00:34:19.057 --> 00:34:21.457
- Sorry.
- Don't say sorry to me.

00:34:21.526 --> 00:34:24.154
You let down Frank, you let down me,
you let down Max, most importantly.

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:26.424
And right about now,
I'm having a real hard time

00:34:26.498 --> 00:34:30.059
trying to figure out why I take my time out of
my schedule to try to help you get over...

00:34:30.135 --> 00:34:32.160
Earmuffs. That whore that you dated.

00:34:32.237 --> 00:34:37.072
Wanna go out and see the other guys?
Uncle Mitch is sorry.

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:40.211
Say "yes."

00:34:40.278 --> 00:34:41.370
Yes.

00:34:43.315 --> 00:34:44.976
[squealing tires]

00:34:48.353 --> 00:34:50.378
Here's the deal.
Listen up!

00:34:50.456 --> 00:34:53.323
All together, we've picked
1 4 pledges.

00:34:53.392 --> 00:34:55.326
Wait, who's this guy?

00:34:55.394 --> 00:34:56.827
That's Blue.

00:34:56.895 --> 00:34:59.261
He's an old Navy vet
who hangs around my store a lot.

00:34:59.331 --> 00:35:01.060
But don't worry about it.
He's legit.

00:35:01.133 --> 00:35:03.658
He looks like he's 1 00 years old.
He wants to pledge?

00:35:03.735 --> 00:35:07.364
Are you kidding me?
The Old Man River won't shut up about it.

00:35:07.439 --> 00:35:09.373
Go time!

00:35:10.442 --> 00:35:12.103
[squealing tires]

00:35:24.823 --> 00:35:27.485
Don't make this any harder
on yourself!

00:35:31.730 --> 00:35:34.130
[squealing tires, horns beeping]

00:35:40.105 --> 00:35:41.037
What's going on?

00:35:41.106 --> 00:35:43.597
You tell anyone about this,
I'll fuckin' kill you!

00:35:43.675 --> 00:35:46.610
I'm kidding. We'll have him back tonight.
Okay, sweetie?

00:35:46.678 --> 00:35:48.009
Let's go!

00:35:49.181 --> 00:35:51.081
[squealing tires]

00:35:51.617 --> 00:35:53.812
[van engine roaring]

00:35:55.487 --> 00:35:57.216
[tires squeal]

00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:02.190
Come on, let's go.
There we go, Blue.

00:36:02.261 --> 00:36:04.422
[tires squeal]

00:36:12.404 --> 00:36:14.372
Congratulations, gentlemen.

00:36:14.439 --> 00:36:16.532
You should all be
very proud of yourselves.

00:36:16.608 --> 00:36:19.577
Each and every one of you
has been hand-picked

00:36:19.645 --> 00:36:23.137
to represent our inaugural
pledge class.

00:36:23.215 --> 00:36:25.775
Over the next 21 days,

00:36:25.851 --> 00:36:32.415
you're all going to experience intense
mental and physical strain.

00:36:32.791 --> 00:36:34.281
[screams:] D-ahhh!!

00:36:35.127 --> 00:36:37.095
Frank, just pace yourself.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.058
Copy that. Just got
a little overexcited. Sorry.

00:36:41.133 --> 00:36:45.365
At this point
you may be asking yourself,

00:36:45.437 --> 00:36:50.170
"Why am I holding
this 30-pound cinderblock in my hands?"

00:36:51.877 --> 00:36:54.209
You might also ask yourself,

00:36:55.247 --> 00:37:00.583
"Why does this cinderblock
have a long piece of string

00:37:01.486 --> 00:37:03.147
tied to it?"

00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:06.019
And finally,

00:37:07.926 --> 00:37:11.919
"Why's the other end of this string
tied securely

00:37:12.497 --> 00:37:14.397
to your penis?"

00:37:15.634 --> 00:37:18.933
And the answer, ladies, is trust.

00:37:19.972 --> 00:37:23.203
This is your first test.

00:37:23.775 --> 00:37:25.299
Spanish!

00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:27.978
Do you trust we've provided you
with enough slack

00:37:28.046 --> 00:37:30.606
so your block will land safely
on the lawn?

00:37:30.682 --> 00:37:32.206
Sir, yes, sir.

00:37:32.284 --> 00:37:34.081
- And Blue!
- Yes, sir?

00:37:34.152 --> 00:37:36.484
Do you trust that I do not want
to see you die here tonight?

00:37:36.555 --> 00:37:38.887
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Blue, you're my boy!

00:37:38.957 --> 00:37:40.288
Thank you, sir.

00:37:42.794 --> 00:37:44.352
About face.

00:37:45.063 --> 00:37:47.531
[drum cadence]

00:37:47.666 --> 00:37:49.429
Step to the edge!

00:37:53.372 --> 00:37:55.772
Pledges, prepare to release!

00:37:57.976 --> 00:37:59.568
One...

00:37:59.945 --> 00:38:01.207
two...

00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:03.910
three! Release!

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:04.971
[yelling]

00:38:07.753 --> 00:38:10.017
Aahh!

00:38:11.290 --> 00:38:12.552
[unison]
Oh...!

00:38:12.691 --> 00:38:14.625
[girlish squeals]

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:17.190
Wasn't meant to happen
like that, Weensie!

00:38:17.262 --> 00:38:19.924
Walk it off, big guy.
We're coming down.

00:38:20.499 --> 00:38:22.490
# One, two, three, four

00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:24.592
# One, two, three, four

00:38:24.670 --> 00:38:27.036
# I've been laid more times than God

00:38:27.105 --> 00:38:29.266
# Got six kids in Laung-Pau-Lad

00:38:29.341 --> 00:38:33.300
# One two three four
One two three four

00:38:33.478 --> 00:38:37.847
# I don't know, but it's been said
One more lap and I'll be dead

00:38:37.916 --> 00:38:39.781
- # One two three four...
- Faster!

00:38:41.453 --> 00:38:44.422
Jesus. Who are these people?

00:38:47.392 --> 00:38:49.952
Patricia, get security
to the South Lawn.

00:38:50.028 --> 00:38:52.724
We have an illegal off-road vehicle
operating without a permit.

00:38:52.798 --> 00:38:54.925
They've already been called, sir.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.264
Call them again.

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:06.543
It's been two weeks.
How are these guys still a fraternity?

00:39:06.611 --> 00:39:08.374
They're not a fraternity, sir.

00:39:08.447 --> 00:39:11.382
They've been approved for temporary
status by the student council.

00:39:11.450 --> 00:39:13.782
Half these guys don't even
go to the school.

00:39:13.852 --> 00:39:15.843
You see the one guy, he's like 90.

00:39:15.921 --> 00:39:18.685
Technically, that doesn't matter.
They found a loophole.

00:39:18.757 --> 00:39:20.247
- A loophole?
- Yes.

00:39:20.325 --> 00:39:21.883
Well, it's interesting, sir.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:25.327
As stupid as they appear,
they're actually very good at paperwork.

00:39:25.397 --> 00:39:27.126
It's quite an anomaly.

00:39:27.733 --> 00:39:30.497
I'm sorry, is that funny?
Are you a standup comic?

00:39:30.569 --> 00:39:32.059
Is that what you do now?

00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:37.201
This is me leaving. This is me leaving.

00:39:39.945 --> 00:39:41.936
[copier whirs]

00:39:48.987 --> 00:39:50.682
There he is.

00:39:51.556 --> 00:39:53.285
What's going on, brother?

00:39:53.358 --> 00:39:55.588
Nothing.
Just making some copies.

00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:58.385
See you later.

00:39:58.463 --> 00:40:00.658
Hey, Mitch, hang on a second.

00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:03.530
I heard you guys are
starting up a fraternity.

00:40:03.602 --> 00:40:05.001
Who told you that?

00:40:05.070 --> 00:40:07.163
Nobody. Is it true?

00:40:07.239 --> 00:40:09.673
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Right.

00:40:09.741 --> 00:40:12.209
It sounds cool, man.
I want in.

00:40:13.345 --> 00:40:16.644
Listen to me.
There is no fraternity.

00:40:16.715 --> 00:40:19.047
I don't even know
what you're talking about.

00:40:19.117 --> 00:40:21.813
You listen to me.
I need this, okay?

00:40:21.887 --> 00:40:26.085
My wife, my job, my kids.
Every day is exactly the same.

00:40:26.158 --> 00:40:28.490
I go golfing on Sundays.

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:30.653
I hate golf.

00:40:30.729 --> 00:40:33.061
Don't blackball me, Mitch.
Please.

00:40:33.131 --> 00:40:36.726
I am not blackballing you.
We work together, Walsh.

00:40:36.802 --> 00:40:39.999
And I don't want to mix work
with whatever it is I do at home.

00:40:40.372 --> 00:40:43.432
Trust me, you're not
missing anything, anyways.

00:40:43.508 --> 00:40:44.668
Really?

00:40:44.743 --> 00:40:47.177
Heard you hooked up
with Goldberg's daughter.

00:40:47.546 --> 00:40:50.174
Sorry. Sorry.

00:40:51.216 --> 00:40:53.309
That is untrue!

00:40:57.255 --> 00:40:59.780
Hey, Mitch, all I'm saying is
think about it, okay?

00:40:59.858 --> 00:41:01.257
Think about it!

00:41:01.459 --> 00:41:03.586
So what?
Who cares if you work with the guy?

00:41:03.662 --> 00:41:06.096
I do. I mean, I have a career
to worry about.

00:41:06.164 --> 00:41:10.191
You're killing me. You really need
to start embracing this whole thing here.

00:41:10.268 --> 00:41:13.203
The frustrating thing is I don't think
you appreciate everything I did for you.

00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:15.262
- For me?
- Yeah, for you.

00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:18.571
You think I like avoiding my wife and kids
to hang out with 1 9-year-old girls all day?

00:41:18.643 --> 00:41:20.338
- Yeah, I do.
- Well, I don't, man.

00:41:20.412 --> 00:41:22.607
- I'm doing this whole thing for you.
- Hello.

00:41:22.681 --> 00:41:25.912
Nicole, how's it going?
Who's this?

00:41:25.984 --> 00:41:28.214
This is my daughter, Amanda.
Say hi, sweetie.

00:41:28.286 --> 00:41:30.652
Hi, Amanda.
You remember Nicole, right?

00:41:30.722 --> 00:41:34.180
Yeah, we did a little chicken dancing
at the wedding, actually.

00:41:34.259 --> 00:41:36.420
- How you been?
- Fine, thanks.

00:41:36.494 --> 00:41:37.290
Good.

00:41:37.362 --> 00:41:40.297
I actually wanted
to apologize to you about the wedding.

00:41:40.365 --> 00:41:42.230
I hope I didn't embarrass you.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.235
It's okay.
You just embarrassed yourself.

00:41:45.303 --> 00:41:48.932
- I brought you a housewarming gift.
- That is really nice.

00:41:49.007 --> 00:41:52.773
It's just a CD holder, you know, for your
desk or whatever. I thought it was...

00:41:52.844 --> 00:41:55.438
No, that thing's a piece of crap.
Awful.

00:41:56.748 --> 00:41:59.478
- I stopped selling it six months ago.
- Please, hey, Beanie.

00:41:59.551 --> 00:42:01.178
- Thanks.
- A lot of complaints.

00:42:01.252 --> 00:42:03.550
- But it's a nice gesture, I think.
- No, this is cool.

00:42:03.621 --> 00:42:05.111
Hey, Godfather!

00:42:05.190 --> 00:42:07.590
- What's up?
- Yo, you the man, dog!

00:42:07.659 --> 00:42:09.092
See you around, homey!

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:11.151
Did that guy just call you
the Godfather?

00:42:11.229 --> 00:42:13.891
Must be joking around or something.

00:42:13.965 --> 00:42:15.626
Where are you guys living now?

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.794
We're staying with my dad for awhile,
until I find something better.

00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:20.838
The move's been a little rough on Amanda.

00:42:20.905 --> 00:42:25.604
My son Max is turning six on Sunday.
We're having a birthday party for him.

00:42:25.677 --> 00:42:28.043
Just like, petting zoo and clowns,
stuff like that.

00:42:28.113 --> 00:42:30.047
But you guys are welcome to come,
if you like.

00:42:30.115 --> 00:42:32.174
- Great idea! You should definitely come.
- Okay.

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:35.811
What do you guys like better?
Nurse or cheerleader?

00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:39.087
Hi, Nicole.

00:42:39.624 --> 00:42:41.091
Hi, Frank.

00:42:41.159 --> 00:42:43.650
It's a nice doll you have there.

00:42:43.728 --> 00:42:45.821
Yeah, thanks.
She's okay.

00:42:46.831 --> 00:42:48.321
Did you have fun at the wedding?

00:42:49.234 --> 00:42:51.031
Yeah, it was fun.

00:42:52.537 --> 00:42:55.233
I'm just staying here, for right now.

00:42:55.306 --> 00:42:57.035
Anyways, we'll see you Sunday then.

00:42:57.108 --> 00:42:59.008
Sunday, right. Okay.

00:42:59.077 --> 00:43:00.908
- Bye. Say bye.
- Bye.

00:43:02.113 --> 00:43:03.341
Bye.

00:43:10.455 --> 00:43:12.650
- Hi, you've reached Marissa.
- And Frank!

00:43:12.724 --> 00:43:15.090
We're not here,
so leave us a message.

00:43:15.159 --> 00:43:16.786
Hey, honey, it's me.

00:43:16.861 --> 00:43:20.490
Listen, just was calling to check in.

00:43:20.565 --> 00:43:24.228
I been kind of busy lately.
A lot of paperwork, stuff like that.

00:43:24.302 --> 00:43:25.291
Damn it.

00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:29.932
If you are satisfied, press "1. "
To rerecord, press "2. "

00:43:30.942 --> 00:43:33.877
Hey, Marissa, it's me.
Listen.

00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:36.311
Gonna be in the neighborhood
a little bit later.

00:43:36.381 --> 00:43:40.249
Didn't know if you wanted to
get together for frozen yogurt sometime,

00:43:40.318 --> 00:43:42.616
or maybe even a whole meal of food.

00:43:42.687 --> 00:43:45.247
If that'd be agreeable...
Stupid.

00:43:45.323 --> 00:43:49.419
If you are satisfied, press "1. "
To rerecord, press "2. "

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:53.023
Hey, Marissa, it's Frank Ricard...

00:43:54.432 --> 00:43:55.558
Okay, ladies.

00:43:55.633 --> 00:43:58.602
The secret to a good B.J. is focus.

00:43:58.670 --> 00:44:00.900
I don't care
if it's your husband of 1 0 years

00:44:00.972 --> 00:44:06.000
or some hot sailor you met
at TGl Friday's a couple months ago.

00:44:06.077 --> 00:44:07.601
Who never did call me back

00:44:07.679 --> 00:44:11.115
but did leave me with a
little something called herpes.

00:44:11.182 --> 00:44:14.151
Which I then gave to the dog.

00:44:14.752 --> 00:44:16.344
But that's neither here nor there.

00:44:17.221 --> 00:44:19.018
Grab your vegetables.

00:44:19.090 --> 00:44:20.751
[girls giggle]

00:44:22.427 --> 00:44:25.453
["Hungry Like the Wolf"plays]

00:44:25.563 --> 00:44:28.191
Who's hungry? Who's hungry?

00:44:28.266 --> 00:44:30.393
Come on.
Is this guy for real?

00:44:30.468 --> 00:44:33.631
Yeah, he's fine.
He's the best there is.

00:44:33.705 --> 00:44:36.799
Ladies, our thumbs are down,
our wrists are flexed,

00:44:36.874 --> 00:44:39.308
and we're gonna position
ourselves for insertion.

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:44.207
Ready? Do it.

00:44:46.217 --> 00:44:48.811
Um hmm.
Good, Marissa.

00:44:48.886 --> 00:44:51.719
You can use a little teeth
but don't be a biter.

00:44:54.192 --> 00:44:56.285
Now you're going to do
the work, ladies.

00:44:56.361 --> 00:44:59.125
These carrots are not going
to ejaculate themselves.

00:44:59.197 --> 00:45:01.631
Get into it.
Very good.

00:45:01.699 --> 00:45:03.428
Very good.

00:45:03.501 --> 00:45:05.992
Good, good, good.
Not so good.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:07.935
Please, what are you doing?

00:45:08.005 --> 00:45:10.132
You're not Romulus sucking on
the teats of the mother wolf.

00:45:10.208 --> 00:45:12.142
If you know your Greek mythology.

00:45:12.210 --> 00:45:14.144
Ladies, we are giving head here.

00:45:14.212 --> 00:45:16.180
We're not breast feeding
from a mythological beast.

00:45:16.247 --> 00:45:18.010
[laughing]

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:20.380
Oh, that's funny to you?
'Cause you won't be laughing

00:45:20.451 --> 00:45:22.385
when somebody prematurely
pops in your face.

00:45:22.453 --> 00:45:25.889
It stings, and that is now
why I have a lazy eye.

00:45:25.957 --> 00:45:28.858
Thank you very much.
Continue, please, continue.

00:45:28.926 --> 00:45:31.394
Up and in.

00:45:31.929 --> 00:45:33.954
And mind the stepchildren.

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:36.158
Mind the stepchildren.

00:45:46.844 --> 00:45:50.507
[music plays from house]

00:45:53.818 --> 00:45:57.117
Marissa, come on.
That's it.

00:46:01.392 --> 00:46:03.622
I like what I see.
Don't be afraid to arch it.

00:46:05.963 --> 00:46:08.761
Marissa, come on.
That's it.

00:46:11.502 --> 00:46:14.699
Everybody can learn from Marissa.
I'm gonna take a quick five.

00:46:14.772 --> 00:46:16.763
You guys continue.

00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:20.934
Nice work, Marissa.

00:46:21.979 --> 00:46:24.948
Way to give a hundred and ten percent.

00:46:25.016 --> 00:46:27.507
When I get back there,
I'm gonna show you something I call

00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:30.179
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Penis."

00:46:31.189 --> 00:46:32.315
Did you see that movie?

00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:36.121
I really like it 'cause of
the flying and the magic.

00:46:36.561 --> 00:46:39.496
[glass breaking]
Bastard!

00:46:39.697 --> 00:46:41.995
Someone just make a bad mistake!

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:44.928
[kung-fu scream]

00:46:51.008 --> 00:46:54.341
Jesus Christ, Frank!
What the hell are you doing here?

00:46:54.412 --> 00:46:56.175
You know this person?

00:46:56.247 --> 00:46:58.306
I am so sorry.
Are you hurt?

00:46:58.382 --> 00:47:00.351
- Yes, I'm hurt.
- [groaning]

00:47:06.256 --> 00:47:08.554
Bob's not here. They're on the rocks.

00:47:11.862 --> 00:47:14.387
You've outdone yourself once again.

00:47:14.465 --> 00:47:17.400
It's nice, right?
Spanish, what the hell are you doing?

00:47:17.468 --> 00:47:20.164
Man, I'm just getting some water, yo.
This suit is crazy hot.

00:47:20.237 --> 00:47:24.037
Put your head on. Are you nuts?
That can be very traumatic for these kids.

00:47:24.108 --> 00:47:26.474
- You're right, I'm sorry, sir.
- Don't "sorry" me.

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:29.011
Shake the tail when you walk, man.
You're better than that.

00:47:29.079 --> 00:47:30.239
Take it easy.

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:31.906
You don't see me breaking
the fourth wall.

00:47:32.149 --> 00:47:33.980
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

00:47:34.051 --> 00:47:35.916
- Nice costume.
- Thanks a lot.

00:47:35.986 --> 00:47:38.250
- This is a great party.
- When'd you get here?

00:47:38.322 --> 00:47:41.257
Just a few minutes ago.
This is my boyfriend, Mark.

00:47:41.325 --> 00:47:44.761
Flew over from Colorado yesterday.
This is Mitch and Beanie.

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:46.386
How's it hanging, boys?

00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:47.521
Pleasure to meet you.

00:47:47.598 --> 00:47:50.158
So, listen, somebody told me

00:47:50.234 --> 00:47:52.668
you guys are in a fraternity,
is that right?

00:47:52.736 --> 00:47:55.170
- No.
- A fraternity. Is that true?

00:47:55.239 --> 00:47:59.869
Not really. I mean, no.
It's more kind of like a social club.

00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:02.411
We just kinda watch football
and hang out.

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:05.039
Hang out and spank each other, I bet.

00:48:05.115 --> 00:48:07.242
It's not like that.
We don't take it too seriously...

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:10.411
Blue! How come there's no ice
in my lemonade?

00:48:10.487 --> 00:48:11.954
Sorry, sir!

00:48:12.022 --> 00:48:14.456
You drop down
and you give me ten!

00:48:14.525 --> 00:48:15.890
- Now!
- Yes, sir.

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.684
Let's go!

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:18.921
That's Frank.

00:48:20.164 --> 00:48:22.997
I'm gonna go ahead and give you these.
It's my work phone. Call me.

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.658
Speaker City. I own all six locations.

00:48:25.202 --> 00:48:28.933
Max wants to open up his gifts,
but I thought maybe one would be all right?

00:48:29.006 --> 00:48:31.907
Come on in here, Maxy.
You guys mind giving me a minute?

00:48:31.975 --> 00:48:34.705
We'll talk surround sound
and everything else later. I'll cut you a deal.

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:36.803
I'm not gonna hold you over
the coals for it.

00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.541
How you doing, bud?
What a day!

00:48:38.615 --> 00:48:41.379
We can open Uncle Frank's,
but we got to wait for the others.

00:48:41.452 --> 00:48:44.114
I don't know who's more excited,
Frank or Max.

00:48:44.188 --> 00:48:46.884
Rip it up! Go at there. What is it?

00:48:46.957 --> 00:48:50.188
Could it be a space ship?
Let's see what we got!

00:48:50.260 --> 00:48:52.387
Yay!

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:55.891
What do you think, Max, huh?
It's got three speeds.

00:48:55.966 --> 00:49:01.962
[children's song playing]

00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.739
Damn it.

00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:11.708
Excuse me.
I'll have one of those.

00:49:13.317 --> 00:49:15.148
I'm Mark. What's your name?

00:49:15.219 --> 00:49:16.311
Tracy.

00:49:17.688 --> 00:49:20.418
Nice meeting you, Tracy.

00:49:20.557 --> 00:49:23.526
- Right on there.
- There we go.

00:49:23.594 --> 00:49:26.085
Okay, you can go back out
and play now.

00:49:26.163 --> 00:49:27.425
Come on.

00:49:27.498 --> 00:49:31.059
There. Take your doll. Okay.

00:49:33.203 --> 00:49:35.865
I think she likes you.
She ignores most people.

00:49:35.939 --> 00:49:37.429
I feel honored.

00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:43.773
So, Mark, he seems like
an interesting guy.

00:49:43.847 --> 00:49:45.371
He's harmless.

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:48.049
- How long have you two been together?
- Two years now.

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:52.649
I told him I had a crush on you
in high school and I think I got him jealous.

00:49:52.723 --> 00:49:54.623
You had a crush on me?

00:49:54.691 --> 00:49:57.888
You got to be kidding me.
I was obsessed with you.

00:49:57.961 --> 00:50:02.523
Not in a dangerous way, you know.
I just watched you a lot, from a distance.

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:04.794
How come you never
asked me out then?

00:50:04.868 --> 00:50:07.462
You were pretty intimidating back then.

00:50:07.538 --> 00:50:11.998
You were always with older guys.
You had that Whitesnake jean jacket.

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:15.203
You smoked Marlboro Reds.
You were way out of my league.

00:50:17.347 --> 00:50:20.009
I still have the Whitesnake
jean jacket.

00:50:20.651 --> 00:50:23.984
I'm still pretty intimidated by you.

00:50:27.524 --> 00:50:31.483
You're bad.

00:50:31.662 --> 00:50:34.358
You're right. I am bad.

00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:39.095
I'm sorry...

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:41.467
- I guess we're not knocking?
- Excuse me.

00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:43.836
Excuse me, I've got to get
back to work.

00:50:43.907 --> 00:50:46.432
...just returning these Band-Aids.

00:50:47.711 --> 00:50:49.736
What are you gonna do?
Tell on me?

00:50:49.813 --> 00:50:53.749
You know you can't, buddy.
It's guy code. Okay?

00:50:53.984 --> 00:50:57.044
Guys don't tell on other guys.
That's, uh...

00:50:57.120 --> 00:50:58.781
something chicks do.

00:50:59.656 --> 00:51:01.248
[gargles]

00:51:01.325 --> 00:51:03.486
You're not a chick, are you?

00:51:06.229 --> 00:51:10.029
All right. Good talk.
I'll see you out there.

00:51:18.542 --> 00:51:20.134
Hey there, buddy.

00:51:20.210 --> 00:51:21.939
Need a friend?

00:51:22.846 --> 00:51:24.438
Yeah, me, too.

00:51:27.718 --> 00:51:28.707
Hey.

00:51:35.125 --> 00:51:37.616
[pony whinnies, Frank whistles]

00:51:37.694 --> 00:51:39.821
Wow.

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:42.490
- She's a beauty, ain't she?
- Yeah.

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:44.761
What kind of gun is this?

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:46.735
That's a tranquilizer gun.

00:51:46.803 --> 00:51:50.068
If any of these little fuckers decide to freak
out on the kids,

00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:51.573
I get to take them down.

00:51:53.176 --> 00:51:55.144
Ain't that right, mother?
What?

00:51:55.212 --> 00:51:57.305
That's what I thought. Shut up.

00:51:57.681 --> 00:51:59.911
Hey, be careful with that.

00:51:59.983 --> 00:52:02.713
That's the most powerful
tranq gun on the market.

00:52:02.786 --> 00:52:04.378
Got her in Mexico.

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:06.786
- Cool.
- Yeah, it is cool.

00:52:06.857 --> 00:52:09.792
They say it could puncture
the skin of a rhino from a hundred...

00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:13.057
Oww! Oh...

00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:18.499
Yes!

00:52:18.568 --> 00:52:20.126
That's awesome!

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:22.333
What?

00:52:22.806 --> 00:52:25.400
You just took one
in the jugular, man!

00:52:25.475 --> 00:52:28.672
Ha! Whoa.

00:52:29.179 --> 00:52:30.271
Yes!

00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:31.813
[laughing]

00:52:31.882 --> 00:52:33.679
Oh, my God.

00:52:34.618 --> 00:52:37.246
Oh, my God, I did.
Is this bad?

00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:39.282
Is this bad?

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:42.086
You should pull that out.
That shit is not cool.

00:52:44.928 --> 00:52:46.225
Wait.

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:48.821
[distorted voice]
Wait. Pull what out?

00:52:48.899 --> 00:52:52.426
The dart, man.
You got a fuckin' dart in your neck.

00:52:55.472 --> 00:52:58.407
You're craz... You're crazy, man.

00:52:58.475 --> 00:53:00.340
You're crazy.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:02.105
I like you.

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:04.574
But you're crazy.

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:08.016
I feel tired.

00:53:15.258 --> 00:53:19.194
# Happy birthday to you

00:53:19.262 --> 00:53:22.254
No!

00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:10.510
# Because a vision softly creeping

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:15.040
# Left its seeds while I was sleeping

00:54:16.253 --> 00:54:19.381
This is the most beautiful day.

00:54:20.524 --> 00:54:21.991
Yes.

00:54:22.726 --> 00:54:24.557
It really is.

00:54:25.896 --> 00:54:30.959
- # Within the sound of silence
- [chewing]

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:33.697
I've missed you, Frank.

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:36.170
I'm so glad you're back.

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.131
I've missed you too, honey.

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:42.308
You look gorgeous.

00:54:43.547 --> 00:54:45.606
You're sweet.

00:54:45.682 --> 00:54:49.209
# I turned my collar
To the cold and damp

00:54:53.657 --> 00:54:56.125
[gagging]

00:54:57.294 --> 00:55:00.320
- He just French kissed me!
- [crowd groaning]

00:55:00.397 --> 00:55:01.659
[moaning]

00:55:05.701 --> 00:55:07.032
This better work.

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:08.938
The board members are beginning to ask
questions about this "civilian fraternity."

00:55:08.938 --> 00:55:10.997
The board members are beginning to ask
questions about this "civilian fraternity."

00:55:11.073 --> 00:55:13.371
Don't worry, it'll work.

00:55:14.643 --> 00:55:18.477
Here she comes.
Her name is Megan Huang.

00:55:18.547 --> 00:55:19.980
She's student council president,

00:55:20.049 --> 00:55:23.780
prelaw, star of the tennis team,
a very promising young woman.

00:55:23.852 --> 00:55:25.752
A young woman with a lot to lose.

00:55:25.821 --> 00:55:27.379
- Megan, hello.
- Hi.

00:55:27.456 --> 00:55:29.048
Have a seat.

00:55:35.397 --> 00:55:37.922
I'm sure you know Dean Pritchard.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.490
Don't turn around.

00:55:42.271 --> 00:55:45.866
Megan, this little fraternity
over on Brook Street

00:55:45.941 --> 00:55:49.775
has become quite an inconvenience
for us, okay?

00:55:49.845 --> 00:55:54.009
And as student body president,
you approved their temporary status.

00:55:54.083 --> 00:55:58.076
Unfortunately, you alone
have the ability to revoke it.

00:55:58.153 --> 00:56:00.587
So, we're gonna need you to
go ahead and do that.

00:56:00.656 --> 00:56:03.989
Revoke it? Why?
Everybody loves those guys.

00:56:04.059 --> 00:56:08.359
They throw the sickest parties.
I met my boyfriend at their casino night.

00:56:08.430 --> 00:56:10.295
Uh-huh, that's great.

00:56:10.366 --> 00:56:13.767
It says here you are applying
to Columbia Law School.

00:56:13.836 --> 00:56:16.566
Wow, that's a tough school
to get into.

00:56:16.638 --> 00:56:20.631
You know, Dean Pritchard has
some serious connections at Columbia.

00:56:21.443 --> 00:56:23.001
Are you bribing me?

00:56:26.048 --> 00:56:28.278
Don't make life
harder on yourself, Chang.

00:56:28.350 --> 00:56:29.874
It's Huang.

00:56:30.552 --> 00:56:33.646
Whatever.
How's the tennis season going?

00:56:34.056 --> 00:56:37.787
I made some minor changes,
but overall it's okay.

00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.658
- It's a pretty standard lease.
- Okay, great.

00:56:40.729 --> 00:56:44.756
Thank you for taking a look at it for me.
This stuff always confuses me.

00:56:44.833 --> 00:56:46.027
Anytime.

00:56:46.201 --> 00:56:49.932
So, you and Mark are
moving in together?

00:56:50.539 --> 00:56:54.703
Yeah.
Well, financially it makes sense, so...

00:56:55.210 --> 00:56:59.772
You know, there's something
I think you should know...

00:57:00.749 --> 00:57:02.512
about Mark.

00:57:02.584 --> 00:57:04.074
What is it?

00:57:04.520 --> 00:57:07.819
Well...
[sighs deeply]

00:57:09.458 --> 00:57:12.325
Relationships are a lot of work.

00:57:12.394 --> 00:57:15.420
And, I guess what I'm saying is...

00:57:20.269 --> 00:57:21.793
Good luck.

00:57:22.905 --> 00:57:25.339
Oh, okay.
Well, thank you.

00:57:25.407 --> 00:57:27.238
Yeah. Listen.

00:57:27.309 --> 00:57:31.678
I was thinking maybe sometime
we could get some dinner or something?

00:57:31.747 --> 00:57:33.738
- Yeah.
- If that's okay with you.

00:57:33.816 --> 00:57:35.647
- I'd like that.
- Yeah.

00:57:35.717 --> 00:57:40.313
Of course, leave it to me to wait until
you've got a boyfriend

00:57:40.389 --> 00:57:42.186
to finally ask you out.

00:57:42.257 --> 00:57:44.020
Timing was never your thing.

00:57:44.093 --> 00:57:45.424
No.

00:57:47.496 --> 00:57:49.430
Okay, so, thank you.

00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:53.566
And, call me about dinner.

00:57:53.635 --> 00:57:55.865
- I will.
- Excuse me, sir!

00:57:56.171 --> 00:57:57.900
We have a situation, sir!

00:57:57.973 --> 00:58:00.203
What are you guys doing here?
I said never at work.

00:58:00.275 --> 00:58:01.765
But it's an emergency.

00:58:01.844 --> 00:58:04.312
We can only buy KY Jelly
in the 4-ounce tubes.

00:58:04.379 --> 00:58:09.373
Industrial size cans will take up to
3 to 4 business days, so we're screwed.

00:58:09.451 --> 00:58:10.577
What's all that for?

00:58:10.652 --> 00:58:12.779
It's Blue's birthday.
We're having a KY wrestling match.

00:58:12.855 --> 00:58:16.188
You know what?
Can we talk about this later, please?

00:58:20.062 --> 00:58:23.031
I'm going again, baby!

00:58:23.098 --> 00:58:24.963
- [crowd cheering]
- Whoo-hoo!

00:58:32.441 --> 00:58:34.636
Yeah! Yeah!

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:37.702
This doesn't seem fair!
I'm on a roll!

00:58:49.058 --> 00:58:50.685
Rip his head off!

00:58:50.759 --> 00:58:53.159
Rip his head off!

00:58:53.229 --> 00:58:56.665
[romantic music plays]

00:58:56.732 --> 00:58:59.030
[indistinct conversation, giggling]

00:58:59.435 --> 00:59:02.233
[inhaling]

00:59:05.474 --> 00:59:07.374
I like your room.

00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:10.970
Thanks a lot. It's kind of
a home away from home for me.

00:59:11.046 --> 00:59:13.207
All the posters are mine.

00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:16.882
I don't usually like fraternity guys.
They're such losers.

00:59:16.952 --> 00:59:21.082
But, you're like... mature.

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:22.918
Mature?

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:24.186
Yeah.

00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:27.627
So, where do you sleep, anyway?

00:59:27.696 --> 00:59:30.392
Usually, I sleep at home.

00:59:30.466 --> 00:59:32.832
Sometimes I do crash here.

00:59:32.902 --> 00:59:36.303
This is a futon, actually.
It pulls out, you know.

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:37.930
Cool, I didn't realize.

00:59:38.541 --> 00:59:40.236
Can I see it?

00:59:40.709 --> 00:59:42.233
The futon?

00:59:42.611 --> 00:59:43.976
Yeah.

00:59:46.982 --> 00:59:48.313
Wow.

00:59:50.786 --> 00:59:52.686
Amy, I'm sorry.

00:59:53.255 --> 00:59:56.520
I'm married.
And I can't do this.

00:59:56.592 --> 00:59:58.560
I don't want this to get weird, but...

00:59:58.627 --> 01:00:01.221
Right. I see.

01:00:01.897 --> 01:00:04.695
But why don't you
leave me your number?

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.895
This way, if something happens to my wife,
I can give you a call.

01:00:07.970 --> 01:00:10.734
- I don't think so.
- Okay, that was a bad idea.

01:00:10.806 --> 01:00:13.172
[bell ringing]

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:16.700
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to tonight's main event!

01:00:22.284 --> 01:00:25.447
In this corner,
weighing in at 1 10 pounds,

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:28.422
and pushing 89 years of age,

01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:31.653
the recent recipient of a brand-new
plastic hip,

01:00:31.727 --> 01:00:34.059
Joseph "Blue" Pulasky!

01:00:34.129 --> 01:00:36.723
[crowd cheering]

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.933
And in the opposite corner,
with a combined weight of 21 0 pounds,

01:00:43.005 --> 01:00:45.735
hailing from Hayden dormitory,

01:00:45.808 --> 01:00:47.833
Jenny and Jeanie!

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.209
[crowd cheering]

01:00:53.716 --> 01:00:56.708
Fighters, are you ready?

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.079
Blue, you sure
you're okay with this?

01:01:01.156 --> 01:01:03.989
Just ring the fucking bell, you pansy.

01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:07.454
Let's get it on!
[bell dings]

01:01:07.529 --> 01:01:09.121
[blowing whistle]

01:01:12.101 --> 01:01:14.729
- Come on.
- Come on, grandpa, let's go.

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:17.101
Let's go, birthday boy!

01:01:17.172 --> 01:01:20.039
What's the matter, you scared?

01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:21.406
Hello?

01:01:29.384 --> 01:01:32.547
[acoustic guitar plays]

01:01:37.492 --> 01:01:41.758
# I close my eyes

01:01:42.330 --> 01:01:46.733
# Only for a moment
And the moment's gone

01:01:47.803 --> 01:01:51.762
# All my dreams

01:01:52.741 --> 01:01:56.802
# Pass before my eyes
In curiosity

01:01:58.513 --> 01:02:00.811
# Dust in the wind

01:02:00.882 --> 01:02:04.147
Looks like we better put the KY wrestling
on hold for a while.

01:02:04.219 --> 01:02:06.312
Good idea.

01:02:06.388 --> 01:02:10.757
Please don't beat yourself up
over this thing. It's not your fault.

01:02:10.826 --> 01:02:13.158
Damn it, Blue was old.

01:02:13.228 --> 01:02:15.992
That's what old people do.
They die.

01:02:16.064 --> 01:02:17.691
I'm sorry.

01:02:18.533 --> 01:02:22.936
# All we are is
Dust in the wind

01:02:25.073 --> 01:02:30.705
# Ah-ah-ah!

01:02:31.613 --> 01:02:33.240
You're my boy, Blue!

01:02:33.748 --> 01:02:35.648
You're my boy.

01:02:39.287 --> 01:02:41.619
It's been a weird month, huh?

01:02:41.690 --> 01:02:43.157
Yeah.

01:02:44.826 --> 01:02:48.455
Listen, I'm sorry I didn't call you
on your birthday.

01:02:48.530 --> 01:02:50.555
My birthday, what do you mean?

01:02:50.632 --> 01:02:52.395
Yeah, last Thursday.

01:02:53.768 --> 01:02:56.737
- You forgot your birthday, didn't you?
- Damn it!

01:02:56.805 --> 01:02:58.796
I'm such an idiot.

01:03:00.141 --> 01:03:05.135
- What have you been doing?
- I've been keeping busy.

01:03:06.248 --> 01:03:10.617
I... tried to join a new gym.

01:03:11.253 --> 01:03:13.312
That was one thing.

01:03:13.622 --> 01:03:17.786
And there's other stuff.
I can't remember, but, keeping busy.

01:03:17.859 --> 01:03:21.590
You know, I've missed you.
You know?

01:03:21.663 --> 01:03:23.358
I want you to know that.

01:03:23.431 --> 01:03:27.026
I was even thinking maybe tonight
we could get together back at home,

01:03:27.102 --> 01:03:29.900
and, I don't know,
maybe put on the Sisqo CD...

01:03:29.971 --> 01:03:32.633
I don't think that's such a good idea.

01:03:32.908 --> 01:03:35.342
Really? You don't?

01:03:35.410 --> 01:03:37.344
I don't know.

01:03:37.879 --> 01:03:40.541
Maybe we rushed into this,
you know?

01:03:41.449 --> 01:03:45.579
I mean, it just doesn't
feel right, does it?

01:03:47.188 --> 01:03:49.053
Being married?

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:52.422
What do you mean?

01:03:53.695 --> 01:03:56.596
I mean, I think we should
get a divorce.

01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.300
Like a real divorce?

01:04:01.303 --> 01:04:02.668
Yeah.

01:04:03.204 --> 01:04:04.603
Gotcha.

01:04:06.074 --> 01:04:07.905
Okay, well...

01:04:09.444 --> 01:04:10.775
I'm sorry.

01:04:10.845 --> 01:04:13.575
No. Actually, I got to run.

01:04:15.116 --> 01:04:18.677
But, if I don't talk to you,

01:04:18.753 --> 01:04:21.347
keep on, keep trucking, you know?

01:04:23.892 --> 01:04:26.292
Okay, good stuff.

01:04:37.939 --> 01:04:40.169
Well, what do you think?

01:04:40.241 --> 01:04:42.368
Yeah, it's okay.

01:04:42.444 --> 01:04:44.674
- Just okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:45.847 --> 01:04:49.806
I had Mitch take a look at the lease.
He thinks it sounds like a good deal.

01:04:49.884 --> 01:04:52.717
You had Mitch look at the lease?
When?

01:04:52.787 --> 01:04:55.187
Last week,
I stopped by his office.

01:04:55.256 --> 01:04:57.554
- Oh, God.
- What?

01:04:58.360 --> 01:05:00.260
I don't know.

01:05:00.595 --> 01:05:02.654
I'm not so sure about that guy.

01:05:02.731 --> 01:05:04.926
Mitch? Why? He's so sweet.

01:05:05.633 --> 01:05:08.693
Something I saw last week,
at the birthday party.

01:05:08.770 --> 01:05:10.397
What did you see?

01:05:10.472 --> 01:05:13.305
I didn't want to get into this, but...

01:05:13.808 --> 01:05:17.767
I walked in on him, and he was
harassing one of the caterers.

01:05:17.846 --> 01:05:19.245
A young girl.

01:05:19.547 --> 01:05:21.174
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:21.249 --> 01:05:23.979
He was being aggressive
and grabbing her and stuff.

01:05:24.052 --> 01:05:26.782
It was disgusting.
I didn't want to say anything

01:05:26.855 --> 01:05:28.413
'cause he's your friend.
[cell phone rings]

01:05:28.490 --> 01:05:30.822
- Hello?
- Hey Nicole, it's Mitch.

01:05:30.892 --> 01:05:32.416
Hi, Mitch.

01:05:32.494 --> 01:05:35.395
I was thinking, if you're not too busy,

01:05:35.463 --> 01:05:37.761
maybe I'd take you up
on that cup of coffee.

01:05:38.299 --> 01:05:41.393
- Now's not really a good time.
- Look.

01:05:41.770 --> 01:05:46.366
I'm really sorry about the other day.
I want the chance to explain everything.

01:05:46.441 --> 01:05:49.342
- I don't think so.
- It's...

01:05:49.577 --> 01:05:52.341
It's been kind of a tough day,

01:05:52.414 --> 01:05:54.814
and it'd really mean a lot.

01:05:55.383 --> 01:05:57.408
[sizzling]

01:05:58.119 --> 01:06:01.350
Listen, there are a few things
I wanted to clear up,

01:06:01.423 --> 01:06:05.951
because I get the feeling you have
an entirely distorted view of who I am.

01:06:06.027 --> 01:06:08.689
Really? What would
ever give you that idea?

01:06:08.763 --> 01:06:11.732
Okay, that's one pecan pie
and two coffees.

01:06:11.800 --> 01:06:15.463
And don't worry. For the Godfather,
it's always on the house.

01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:18.170
- Not here.
- I know who you are.

01:06:18.239 --> 01:06:20.537
I am Avi. I'm a big supporter
of what you guys are doing.

01:06:20.608 --> 01:06:21.472
Thank you.

01:06:21.543 --> 01:06:25.138
You are beautiful.
No offense, though. He is the king.

01:06:25.213 --> 01:06:27.738
You are taking coffee and pie
with a living legend.

01:06:27.816 --> 01:06:30.250
That's very kind,
but I insist, I'll pay.

01:06:30.318 --> 01:06:32.252
Your money, it's not good here.

01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:34.686
- Okay.
- I look forward to pledging next semester.

01:06:36.157 --> 01:06:39.923
Okay, now don't you think
this is going a little far?

01:06:39.994 --> 01:06:43.122
I heard one of your pledges died.
Is that true?

01:06:43.832 --> 01:06:46.801
Well, yes.
But he was really old.

01:06:46.868 --> 01:06:49.701
And I feel pretty confident that
when we get the autopsy back,

01:06:49.771 --> 01:06:52.001
it'll show that it was probably
of natural causes.

01:06:52.073 --> 01:06:56.339
Look, to be honest, you're really not
the person I thought you were.

01:06:56.411 --> 01:06:58.845
But it's okay. It's not a big deal.

01:06:58.913 --> 01:07:01.211
I think that I am that person.

01:07:01.282 --> 01:07:04.911
And I feel more like myself now
than I have in a really long time.

01:07:04.986 --> 01:07:08.114
So, that's why you go around
harassing young women?

01:07:08.189 --> 01:07:09.918
- Doing what?
- The caterer.

01:07:09.991 --> 01:07:13.017
At the birthday party.
Mark told me about her.

01:07:13.094 --> 01:07:16.461
Wait a second.
I didn't want to say anything,

01:07:16.531 --> 01:07:19.762
but Mark is the one
who was acting inappropriate.

01:07:19.834 --> 01:07:22.029
- You are unbelievable.
- It's true.

01:07:22.103 --> 01:07:23.900
Hey, look who it is.

01:07:23.972 --> 01:07:25.633
Hey, Mitch.

01:07:25.707 --> 01:07:27.072
Darcie, hey.

01:07:27.142 --> 01:07:30.111
Hi. I've been meaning to call you.

01:07:30.178 --> 01:07:32.476
I just didn't want you
to worry about my dad.

01:07:32.547 --> 01:07:35.380
He doesn't know anything,
so it's totally cool.

01:07:35.450 --> 01:07:36.644
Her dad?

01:07:36.751 --> 01:07:38.480
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:44.055
You know, it's nothing, really.
I mean, they actually work together.

01:07:44.826 --> 01:07:50.059
We gotta run, 'cause we got this prom
committee thing, so I'll see you around.

01:07:50.131 --> 01:07:51.063
Sorry.

01:07:51.132 --> 01:07:52.656
Bye.

01:07:53.401 --> 01:07:55.494
Prom committee thing?

01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:58.061
That I actually can explain.

01:07:58.139 --> 01:08:00.198
Right, I'm sure you can.

01:08:00.275 --> 01:08:02.835
- I have to go.
- Please wait a second.

01:08:02.911 --> 01:08:05.812
No, really. I have to go.

01:08:10.251 --> 01:08:12.719
Hey. Chicks.

01:08:12.787 --> 01:08:14.721
Don't worry for her.

01:08:14.789 --> 01:08:17.952
Love, it's a motherfucker.

01:08:50.058 --> 01:08:53.721
Dear Mitch, if you're holding this letter,
you already know.

01:08:53.795 --> 01:08:58.095
The house has been boarded up.
The windows, the doors, everything.

01:08:58.166 --> 01:09:00.999
We're at the Comfort Inn,
room 1 12.

01:09:01.069 --> 01:09:03.094
I love you. Frank.

01:09:03.605 --> 01:09:07.803
Due to these infractions,
not only will your house be repossessed,

01:09:07.876 --> 01:09:11.368
but those of you who are students
will be expelled from the university

01:09:11.446 --> 01:09:14.609
for your participation in
a non-sanctioned fraternity.

01:09:14.682 --> 01:09:18.379
Please take a moment to
allow this information to sink in.

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:20.318
[sirens wailing]

01:09:22.724 --> 01:09:25.887
Good. Believe me,

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:31.023
the actions taken by the student council
have come as a great shock to me.

01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:34.198
But unfortunately, there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:09:34.269 --> 01:09:38.171
Thank you for your time.
Good luck, and God bless America.

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:43.110
[static]

01:09:43.778 --> 01:09:45.473
He can't do that.

01:09:45.547 --> 01:09:47.606
This guy's playing hardball.

01:09:48.483 --> 01:09:51.714
I got to say,
I'm kind of impressed by him.

01:09:51.786 --> 01:09:53.151
Well, we're expelled.

01:09:53.221 --> 01:09:55.689
My life is over and I'm gonna wind up
working at Red Lobster.

01:09:55.757 --> 01:09:59.523
- You already work in Red Lobster.
- Yeah, but it's part time, dick.

01:09:59.594 --> 01:10:02.188
- Guys.
- Hey, listen.

01:10:02.263 --> 01:10:06.723
This is a serious situation.
I mean, I'm kicked out of school.

01:10:08.203 --> 01:10:10.637
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My mom's gonna kill me.

01:10:10.705 --> 01:10:12.935
Come on, she's not gonna kill you.

01:10:13.007 --> 01:10:16.340
Yes, she is. I'm the first one
to go to college in my family.

01:10:16.411 --> 01:10:21.610
When I left, she said,
"Weensie, if you screw this up, I'll kill you."

01:10:21.983 --> 01:10:24.008
She showed me the knife.

01:10:24.252 --> 01:10:27.551
- [Weensie sobbing]
- [Beanie: ] Shhh.

01:10:27.889 --> 01:10:32.223
Mitch is a lawyer, buddy.
He's gonna take care of this thing, okay?

01:10:32.293 --> 01:10:33.954
It's gonna be all right.

01:10:37.098 --> 01:10:39.259
He was supposed to be Luke Skywalker.

01:10:39.334 --> 01:10:41.962
Guys, still want to be in the fraternity?

01:10:43.972 --> 01:10:47.032
We've been waiting all semester
for you to ask us that.

01:10:47.108 --> 01:10:49.338
Good. I need your help with something.

01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:52.038
Off the record.
You do this, you're in.

01:10:52.113 --> 01:10:53.546
Sir, yes, sir.

01:10:53.615 --> 01:10:57.483
Okay. Walsh, I need you to track down
a copy of University Code 7-A,

01:10:57.552 --> 01:10:59.611
- then fax it to this number immediately.
- Got it.

01:10:59.687 --> 01:11:02.019
- I need to talk to you.
- Give me five minutes.

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:04.957
Booker, make two copies of this petition,
have it notarized,

01:11:05.026 --> 01:11:07.586
and then messenger it over
to 34 Langley, and then I need-

01:11:07.662 --> 01:11:11.063
Listen, Donald tells me you got these guys
working prep for the arbitration.

01:11:11.132 --> 01:11:14.329
I told you five times, I want them working
the Sunshine Square deal.

01:11:14.402 --> 01:11:16.996
Well, I locked
the Sunshine Square deal yesterday,

01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:19.335
so now I have them helping
with the arbitration,

01:11:19.407 --> 01:11:22.035
and I'd appreciate it if you let me
handle my own team,

01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:25.204
and don't get on my ass
every time I'm trying to do something.

01:11:26.681 --> 01:11:28.171
All right.

01:11:28.249 --> 01:11:30.240
Wanna make sure
you're on top of it.

01:11:30.318 --> 01:11:31.751
Well, I am.

01:11:31.819 --> 01:11:34.014
Well, good. Carry on.

01:11:34.088 --> 01:11:37.148
See? That's why they call him
the Godfather.

01:11:37.225 --> 01:11:38.055
Hey.

01:11:39.227 --> 01:11:41.388
Just take care of it.

01:11:44.065 --> 01:11:48.331
Gentlemen, I got some good news
and I got some bad news.

01:11:48.403 --> 01:11:50.268
Did a little research.

01:11:50.338 --> 01:11:53.705
What Pritchard did, technically,
is illegal.

01:11:53.775 --> 01:11:55.766
We have the right to a formal evaluation

01:11:55.843 --> 01:11:58.505
before they can deny
our official application.

01:11:58.580 --> 01:12:02.516
However, we're now subject to
a charter certification review

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.051
given by the board of trustees.

01:12:04.118 --> 01:12:05.483
Damn it.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:09.185
Wait. Wait, what does
that mean exactly?

01:12:09.257 --> 01:12:13.159
According to university bylaws,
it's a thorough inspection of the fraternity,

01:12:13.227 --> 01:12:15.218
and our contribution to the community.

01:12:15.296 --> 01:12:17.560
Focus is on five categories:

01:12:17.632 --> 01:12:20.965
Academics, athletics, community service,

01:12:21.035 --> 01:12:23.663
debate, and school spirit.

01:12:24.038 --> 01:12:26.905
Good luck to everybody.
It was nice to know you all.

01:12:26.975 --> 01:12:28.875
And I'll see you around campus.

01:12:28.943 --> 01:12:31.878
Actually, all of us are
being tested. Yeah.

01:12:31.946 --> 01:12:34.938
What are you talking about?
I'm not even in school.

01:12:35.016 --> 01:12:38.611
It's in the bylaws. Every member
of the fraternity is subject to review

01:12:38.686 --> 01:12:41.154
in every category,
including academics.

01:12:41.222 --> 01:12:44.123
Mitch, can you come here a second?
I don't mind popping for breakfast.

01:12:44.192 --> 01:12:46.820
I do speakers. I don't do tests.

01:12:47.328 --> 01:12:49.057
This is unbelievable.

01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:52.930
What happened to, "needing brotherhood
now more than ever?" They need us.

01:12:53.001 --> 01:12:55.060
Come on, college is
overrated anyway.

01:12:55.136 --> 01:12:58.367
I built Speaker City from the ground up.
I can barely read. Truth.

01:12:58.439 --> 01:13:02.466
This damn thing was your idea,
and you convinced me to do it,

01:13:02.543 --> 01:13:04.534
and now people's lives are ruined.

01:13:04.612 --> 01:13:07.046
Ruined? Like, whose life is ruined?

01:13:07.115 --> 01:13:09.174
Well, let's see.

01:13:09.417 --> 01:13:10.975
Blue's dead.

01:13:11.052 --> 01:13:13.020
Frank's divorced.

01:13:13.087 --> 01:13:16.921
I've lost my house.
Nicole thinks I'm a total jackass.

01:13:16.991 --> 01:13:21.291
And now we got nine kids who are gonna
get expelled from school,

01:13:21.362 --> 01:13:23.557
and you're not even gonna
help 'em out.

01:13:37.311 --> 01:13:41.509
Is this thing gonna go down smooth or
what? I'm missing 1 8 holes of golf here.

01:13:41.582 --> 01:13:44.415
One hundred percent.
I got creative with some of their tests.

01:13:44.485 --> 01:13:46.009
It should make for
a very entertaining day.

01:13:46.087 --> 01:13:48.681
I'm going to enjoy kicking
these assholes off campus.

01:13:48.756 --> 01:13:49.620
Ditto.

01:13:51.058 --> 01:13:55.051
Welcome, everyone, to the official
debate section of the charter review.

01:13:56.230 --> 01:13:58.630
Unfortunately,

01:13:58.699 --> 01:14:02.931
the captain of the university debate
team had a scheduling conflict. Yeah.

01:14:03.004 --> 01:14:06.701
So, we had to bring someone else in
to fill in for this event.

01:14:07.208 --> 01:14:11.975
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
the co-host of CNN's Crossfire,

01:14:12.046 --> 01:14:15.538
famed political consultant,
the Raging Cajun,

01:14:15.616 --> 01:14:17.345
Mr. James Carville.

01:14:17.451 --> 01:14:19.510
[applause]

01:14:22.123 --> 01:14:23.886
- Thank you.
- Don't clap.

01:14:23.958 --> 01:14:27.155
Thank you, Dean Pritchard.
It's an honor and pleasure to be here, sir.

01:14:27.228 --> 01:14:29.355
Topic number one.

01:14:31.065 --> 01:14:34.159
What is your position
on the role of government

01:14:34.235 --> 01:14:38.103
in supporting innovation
in the field of biotechnology?

01:14:38.906 --> 01:14:41.340
Well, Dean, I'm glad you
asked that question...

01:14:41.409 --> 01:14:44.537
I'd like to jump in and take that one,
Jimmy, if you don't mind.

01:14:45.980 --> 01:14:48.039
Have at it, hoss.

01:14:48.115 --> 01:14:50.049
Why doesn't he wait for an easy one?

01:14:57.224 --> 01:14:59.920
Recent research has shown
the empirical evidence

01:14:59.994 --> 01:15:02.622
for globalization of
corporate innovation is very limited.

01:15:02.697 --> 01:15:05.860
And as a corollary, the market
for technologies is shrinking.

01:15:05.933 --> 01:15:08.424
As a world leader,
it is important for America to provide

01:15:08.502 --> 01:15:10.663
systematic research grants
for our scientists.

01:15:10.738 --> 01:15:14.674
I believe there will always be a need for us
to have a well-articulated innovation policy

01:15:14.742 --> 01:15:18.041
with emphasis on
human resource development. Thank you.

01:15:18.346 --> 01:15:20.075
[applause]

01:15:22.516 --> 01:15:23.778
Where'd that come from?

01:15:23.851 --> 01:15:25.512
What happened? I blacked out.

01:15:25.586 --> 01:15:27.110
It was awesome.

01:15:27.188 --> 01:15:29.986
That was interesting.
Thank you very much.

01:15:30.057 --> 01:15:33.356
And your rebuttal,
Mr. Carville?

01:15:33.427 --> 01:15:37.454
We have no response.

01:15:37.832 --> 01:15:39.732
That was perfect.

01:15:42.937 --> 01:15:46.270
That's the way you do it!
That's the way you debate.

01:15:56.650 --> 01:15:58.208
Number 1 2.

01:15:58.619 --> 01:16:03.386
Which of the following is
a generally accepted graphical technique

01:16:03.457 --> 01:16:06.915
for determining first order
system parameters?

01:16:07.661 --> 01:16:11.995
Is it, A, Harriot's method
of solving cubics?

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:15.401
B, Pythagorean triplets?

01:16:15.469 --> 01:16:19.633
Or C, the migration method of graphing
quadratic functions?

01:16:22.643 --> 01:16:24.611
Harriot's method of solving cubics.

01:16:24.678 --> 01:16:27.670
The answer is A, Harriot's method
of solving cubics.

01:16:33.988 --> 01:16:35.615
Good test.

01:16:44.765 --> 01:16:47.097
All right, Frank. Let's do this.

01:16:48.202 --> 01:16:49.635
Go Harrison!

01:16:49.703 --> 01:16:51.102
# Everybody dance now!

01:16:57.945 --> 01:16:59.970
# Everybody dance now!

01:17:07.521 --> 01:17:09.250
# Give me the music

01:17:11.659 --> 01:17:13.456
# Give me the music

01:17:14.562 --> 01:17:16.996
# Everybody dance now!

01:17:22.803 --> 01:17:26.000
# Everybody dance now!

01:17:29.143 --> 01:17:31.111
- Yes!
- Wow.

01:17:31.178 --> 01:17:32.509
[drumming]

01:17:39.220 --> 01:17:41.188
Go, Cougars!

01:17:44.658 --> 01:17:46.455
[pained screams]
Oh, no!

01:17:48.329 --> 01:17:51.127
Help me! Help me!

01:17:53.167 --> 01:17:54.361
[laughing]

01:17:55.002 --> 01:17:57.334
Dean Pritchard,
can I talk to you for a second?

01:17:57.404 --> 01:17:58.996
Megan, I'm a little busy.

01:17:59.073 --> 01:18:01.701
I didn't get into
Columbia Law School.

01:18:01.775 --> 01:18:03.333
How awful.

01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:06.504
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:07.672
You're right, I did say that.

01:18:07.748 --> 01:18:09.841
No one at Columbia
has even heard of you.

01:18:09.917 --> 01:18:11.179
Oh, Megan.

01:18:11.652 --> 01:18:14.780
Look, I did my part.
Now you have to do yours.

01:18:14.855 --> 01:18:17.187
- That's how bribes work.
- I know how bribes work.

01:18:17.258 --> 01:18:19.749
I bribe people all the time,
but I changed my mind. It's a free country.

01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:21.886
Lesson learned.

01:18:23.564 --> 01:18:25.532
[banging on locker]

01:18:25.599 --> 01:18:27.123
Damn it!

01:18:28.102 --> 01:18:32.038
Sorry, guys, I lost my composure out there.
I'm an idiot.

01:18:32.106 --> 01:18:35.405
Frankie, don't worry about it.
We'll make those points up, I promise you.

01:18:35.476 --> 01:18:37.706
- Your skin's gonna grow back, too.
- [wincing]

01:18:37.778 --> 01:18:39.245
I'm sorry.

01:18:39.313 --> 01:18:41.508
Okay, how many events
do we actually have left here?

01:18:41.582 --> 01:18:45.211
One. Frank's accident
definitely set us back.

01:18:45.286 --> 01:18:49.245
But if we pass...
If we pass athletics, we're in.

01:18:49.323 --> 01:18:52.190
All right, everybody!
That's what I'm talking about, guys.

01:18:52.259 --> 01:18:54.750
We've made a great effort so far.
Let's just keep it up!

01:18:54.829 --> 01:18:58.663
That's right! We can't have anyone
freak out out there, okay?

01:18:58.733 --> 01:19:02.032
We've got to keep our composure!
We've come too far.

01:19:02.103 --> 01:19:05.300
There's too much to lose!
We've got to just keep our composure!

01:19:05.373 --> 01:19:09.639
For your final test, I've chosen the men's
gymnastics team's all-around competition.

01:19:09.710 --> 01:19:13.578
And participants in the three events
will be chosen at random by me,

01:19:13.647 --> 01:19:14.841
right now.

01:19:14.915 --> 01:19:17.247
Let's see, rings.

01:19:17.318 --> 01:19:18.751
Bernard.

01:19:18.819 --> 01:19:21.583
Okay, great.
Floor exercise.

01:19:21.655 --> 01:19:24.249
How about Frank? Great.

01:19:24.325 --> 01:19:29.627
And for the vault competition,
oh, I don't know...

01:19:29.697 --> 01:19:31.324
How about...

01:19:32.900 --> 01:19:34.765
- You.
- Me?

01:19:35.069 --> 01:19:37.435
Yeah. Is there a problem with that?

01:19:39.373 --> 01:19:43.901
[Chariots of Fire theme plays]

01:20:18.546 --> 01:20:20.480
I'm still holding.

01:20:21.248 --> 01:20:22.579
Still holding!

01:20:26.754 --> 01:20:28.949
It's physically impossible.

01:20:29.023 --> 01:20:32.288
Don't worry.
Abdul is there to spot you.

01:20:36.297 --> 01:20:38.128
We're waiting, gentlemen.

01:20:38.199 --> 01:20:40.997
Just hit the board as hard
as you can and shut your eyes.

01:20:41.068 --> 01:20:42.865
- You ready?
- Have fun with it.

01:20:42.937 --> 01:20:45.565
Go! Come on!

01:20:52.279 --> 01:20:53.541
Come on!

01:20:59.086 --> 01:21:01.145
[high-pitched scream]

01:21:07.294 --> 01:21:09.922
Oh, my God! Yes!

01:21:09.997 --> 01:21:12.659
[cheering and whooping]

01:21:19.273 --> 01:21:21.434
[congratulating, indistinct]

01:21:22.643 --> 01:21:24.133
[Weensie:] Hey, I did good.

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:29.745
Congratulations, gentlemen.
You put forth quite an effort.

01:21:29.817 --> 01:21:30.977
You really did.

01:21:31.051 --> 01:21:34.179
But, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

01:21:34.255 --> 01:21:36.246
You didn't pass your review.

01:21:37.658 --> 01:21:41.025
What are you talking about?
We finished with an 84%.

01:21:41.095 --> 01:21:43.791
Yes, you people did finish
with an 84%,

01:21:43.864 --> 01:21:48.096
but unfortunately, another pledge of yours
scored a "0" in every category.

01:21:48.168 --> 01:21:49.260
What pledge?

01:21:49.336 --> 01:21:52.828
A Joseph "Blue" Pulasky.

01:21:55.309 --> 01:21:59.746
Hey, man, Blue's dead.
He passed away two weeks ago.

01:21:59.813 --> 01:22:02.247
He's listed right here
on your official chapter roster,

01:22:02.316 --> 01:22:05.945
and those zeroes drop your average
to a 58%.

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:08.750
Come on, you got to be kidding me.

01:22:08.822 --> 01:22:10.847
It's been quite a journey.

01:22:11.959 --> 01:22:14.587
You're gonna be all right.
You'll be all right, Frank.

01:22:15.129 --> 01:22:18.428
- Come on, now, big cat.
- I have no reason to live.

01:22:18.499 --> 01:22:20.729
We're gonna find you
a one-bedroom apartment,

01:22:20.801 --> 01:22:23.702
get you back on your feet,
maybe move you in over at Beanie's...

01:22:23.771 --> 01:22:25.432
It's not gonna be the same.

01:22:25.506 --> 01:22:27.974
Didn't quite work out
for you fellas, did it?

01:22:28.042 --> 01:22:30.943
You know what? I recommend
you drive off immediately,

01:22:31.011 --> 01:22:33.343
before something
extremely bad happens.

01:22:33.414 --> 01:22:35.143
- I'm scared.
- Excuse me, Mitch?

01:22:35.216 --> 01:22:36.444
Am I interrupting?

01:22:36.517 --> 01:22:39.782
Megan, you are. If you could leave,
it would be tremendous for all of us.

01:22:39.854 --> 01:22:42.379
I thought you guys might
find this interesting.

01:22:42.656 --> 01:22:46.057
You said if I revoked their charter,
you'd get me into Columbia.

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:47.924
- I did say that.
- Look...

01:22:47.995 --> 01:22:51.453
I did my part, now you have to do yours.
That's how bribes work.

01:22:51.532 --> 01:22:53.159
I know how bribes work...

01:22:53.234 --> 01:22:55.202
You know what?
Just, let me...

01:22:56.203 --> 01:22:58.103
Bird-dog him, Frankie!

01:23:00.741 --> 01:23:02.265
Coming through!

01:23:03.477 --> 01:23:05.809
- Go that way!
- Slow down, man!

01:23:10.351 --> 01:23:13.115
Pritchard, hey, it's over.

01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:17.446
Hand over the tape. It's over.
It's over, okay?

01:23:17.525 --> 01:23:18.753
You know where the rest
of the guys are?

01:23:18.826 --> 01:23:21.761
I don't know, we all spread out...
Ow!

01:23:21.829 --> 01:23:23.296
What are you doing?
What are you...

01:23:25.032 --> 01:23:27.091
Time out. Time out.

01:23:27.168 --> 01:23:28.760
[glass shattering]

01:23:32.206 --> 01:23:34.697
Excuse me! Excuse me!

01:23:34.775 --> 01:23:36.470
Gentlemen...
Oh, God!

01:23:44.919 --> 01:23:46.819
Wait, wait, my shoulder.

01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:54.750
This man accosted me!

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.692
You are all witnesses!
He accosted me!

01:23:56.764 --> 01:23:58.755
- Frank!
- [Frank groaning]

01:24:02.903 --> 01:24:04.768
Frank, are you okay?

01:24:05.039 --> 01:24:08.440
Mitch, I'm so cold.

01:24:10.811 --> 01:24:12.870
Come on, big cat.

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:14.915
I think I see Blue.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.775
He looks glorious.

01:24:17.852 --> 01:24:20.320
- Stay with me.
- Okay.

01:24:21.155 --> 01:24:22.918
I did good.

01:24:24.525 --> 01:24:26.254
You did great.

01:24:57.057 --> 01:24:58.285
Hi.

01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:02.495
Hey! Wow...

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:04.925
How are you?

01:25:04.998 --> 01:25:06.295
I'm okay.

01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.434
You know, I got that apartment.

01:25:08.502 --> 01:25:10.732
Good for you. That's great.

01:25:10.804 --> 01:25:13.295
And you were right about Mark.

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:14.671
What happened?

01:25:14.742 --> 01:25:19.202
Let's just say I caught him red-handed
and it wasn't pretty.

01:25:20.381 --> 01:25:22.815
I guess I thought he could change,
you know?

01:25:22.883 --> 01:25:24.214
I don't know.

01:25:25.786 --> 01:25:27.879
So, you're moving out?

01:25:28.255 --> 01:25:31.884
Yeah, I'm moving into a new place,

01:25:31.959 --> 01:25:33.950
far, far away from here.

01:25:34.027 --> 01:25:36.052
What about your little fraternity?

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:39.861
Well, they're upgrading,
moving into a new facility.

01:25:39.933 --> 01:25:42.299
And to tell you the truth,

01:25:42.369 --> 01:25:45.634
they don't have much use for
the Godfather anymore.

01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:51.100
I hope you'll still think I'm cool
even without all this.

01:25:51.178 --> 01:25:53.203
I think I can deal with it.

01:25:53.280 --> 01:25:54.941
I appreciate it.

01:25:55.516 --> 01:25:57.950
Although, you know,
I have to say,

01:25:58.018 --> 01:26:02.580
I have always been a little curious
about what goes on inside these places.

01:26:02.656 --> 01:26:04.180
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:10.091
I do have another 1 2 hours
on my lease.

01:26:10.164 --> 01:26:13.998
I'd be more than happy to
show you around.

01:26:14.268 --> 01:26:15.360
Really?

01:26:15.436 --> 01:26:16.630
Yeah.

01:26:17.571 --> 01:26:19.129
Maybe for a minute.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.205
Great.

01:26:21.842 --> 01:26:23.571
Happy Tuesday to you out there.

to the Godfather.

01:26:30.284 --> 01:26:33.219
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be here today, Mitch.

01:26:33.287 --> 01:26:35.084
I'd probably be dead.

Face down in
a drained pool somewhere.

01:26:39.426 --> 01:26:42.088
A quick note to all you
future brothers out there,

brand-new house on campus, located
at Dean Pritchard's former residence.

01:26:46.633 --> 01:26:49.227
You all remember that crazy bastard.

01:26:50.604 --> 01:26:53.835
We'd love for you to join us
this Saturday at our open house

01:26:53.907 --> 01:26:57.934
for some chips, soda,
and some late-night streaking.

01:26:58.011 --> 01:27:00.502
Little right. Little more.

01:27:01.048 --> 01:27:03.175
Yeah, that's good enough.
That's good enough.

01:27:03.784 --> 01:27:05.911
- Welcome aboard, Booker.
- Thank you, sir.

01:27:05.986 --> 01:27:08.420
- Walsh. Well done.
- Frank the Tank.

01:27:08.489 --> 01:27:10.354
Why don't you get me
a fresh beer?

01:27:10.424 --> 01:27:11.618
You serious?

01:27:11.692 --> 01:27:12.818
Now!

01:27:13.193 --> 01:27:16.492
Now! Hurry, you sorry son-of-a-bitch!

# Going down the only road
I've ever known

01:27:23.737 --> 01:27:27.605
# Like a drifter I was born
To walk alone

# And I've made up my mind

[horn blaring]
Aahh!

01:27:50.731 --> 01:27:52.028
Oh, shit.

01:28:03.243 --> 01:28:07.407

# All we are is
Dust in the wind

01:28:31.338 --> 01:28:33.272
Stay in the goal.

01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.774
We gotta stay in the goal.
You can't be walking around.

01:28:35.842 --> 01:28:38.106
You're killing me.
Can we stay between the posts?

01:28:38.178 --> 01:28:41.705
I want focus, I want intensity,
and I want "1,2,3"!

01:28:41.782 --> 01:28:42.908
Woofers!

01:28:42.983 --> 01:28:46.885
Go, go, go, eat 'em up!
Hungry! Eat 'em up!

01:28:46.954 --> 01:28:51.050
Caleb, you know what to do in the box.
We talked about it, in the box!

01:28:51.124 --> 01:28:53.092
Chill out, we're up by six.

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:57.893
That ref's a real prick out there.
That's right, you heard me, my man!

01:28:57.965 --> 01:29:01.765
Number four's been throwing elbows,
and someone's kid's gonna get hurt.

01:29:01.835 --> 01:29:03.234
What?

01:29:03.303 --> 01:29:05.134
Let's make it official then, jackass!

01:29:05.205 --> 01:29:06.968
Let's make it official!

01:29:07.841 --> 01:29:10.867
Get the clipboard.
I'll be in the car, all right?

01:29:10.944 --> 01:29:13.003
- Have some respect for yourself.
- Thank you.

01:29:13.747 --> 01:29:16.716
Is that Frank the Tank?

01:29:16.783 --> 01:29:18.876
Hey. Heidi.

01:29:19.753 --> 01:29:22.688
- How you doing?
- I'm doing really good.

01:29:22.756 --> 01:29:25.589
I got into body painting.

01:29:25.659 --> 01:29:27.490
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah.

01:29:27.561 --> 01:29:28.653
That's great.

01:29:28.729 --> 01:29:31.391
Well, you're looking
very healthy.

01:29:31.465 --> 01:29:34.764
Oh, thanks.
Yeah, so are you.

01:29:34.835 --> 01:29:36.769
Oh, thank you.

01:29:36.837 --> 01:29:40.204
So, I heard you and Marissa
split up. Is that true?

01:29:40.273 --> 01:29:42.138
Yeah, we did.

01:29:42.876 --> 01:29:44.810
You poor baby.

01:29:45.612 --> 01:29:47.170
You know, I'm having
this get-together

01:29:47.247 --> 01:29:48.839
at my place
tomorrow night.

01:29:49.016 --> 01:29:52.747
Like a few lnternet friends.
You should swing by.

01:29:52.819 --> 01:29:54.810
- Really?
- Totally.

01:29:55.656 --> 01:29:57.089
- Okay.
- All right.

01:29:57.157 --> 01:30:00.320
- That sounds awesome.
- See you tomorrow night.

01:30:03.163 --> 01:30:04.494
Awesome.

01:30:04.564 --> 01:30:05.997
Yes!

01:30:08.902 --> 01:30:10.767
I am back!

01:30:10.837 --> 01:30:12.532
[whooping]

01:30:14.841 --> 01:30:16.706
You know it!
