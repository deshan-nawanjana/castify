01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:12.907
I mean, what do you think?
You want another beer?

01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:14.469
No, no, no, thank you.

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:17.204
- You sure?
- Yeah, and I do have to go.

01:05:17.346 --> 01:05:21.510
Uh, you know, hey, listen,
I'm so happy, uh, that we did this.

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:23.174
The kid hates me, Wally.

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:29.655
No, no, no.
No, I don't think, uh, Sebastian hates you.

01:05:29.792 --> 01:05:32.386
No, no, he does.
He's told me a couple times.

01:05:32.728 --> 01:05:34.525
Oh, well, um...

01:05:35.264 --> 01:05:38.495
It's just, oh, man, he's got some, uh...

01:05:39.668 --> 01:05:41.863
- Rough edges?
- Yeah, that's it, yeah. I mean, he's...

01:05:42.004 --> 01:05:45.838
He worries a lot, he questions everything.
He's really...

01:05:45.975 --> 01:05:48.170
- Neurotic?
- Yes, that's the word.

01:05:48.310 --> 01:05:50.107
So, what's the problem?

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.679
Well, I don't really relate to that.

01:05:53.816 --> 01:05:55.147
Well...

01:05:58.053 --> 01:06:01.784
Neurotic is simply an intense form
of introspection, okay?

01:06:01.924 --> 01:06:03.755
So you're basically calling him
introspective,

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:05.861
and being introspective is good, okay?

01:06:05.995 --> 01:06:09.453
It's walking around with an opinion,
with a point of view,

01:06:09.598 --> 01:06:12.692
- with some sort of nice kind of direction.
- Yeah, yeah. You've got it too.

01:06:12.835 --> 01:06:15.395
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, those rough edges.

01:06:15.538 --> 01:06:17.472
I mean, don't get me wrong,
it's beautiful.

01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.975
Thanks. Hey, what's not beautiful to you?
You know?

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:25.774
See? You did it again.
That's it, you got that focus.

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:29.908
But that's how we're alike, Wally,
we're both determined.

01:06:30.052 --> 01:06:34.079
Sebastian may be, uh,
resistant to me now, but I'll get through.

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:37.283
Life throws you curveballs,
that's for sure, right?

01:06:37.426 --> 01:06:39.758
I mean, a few months ago,
I was planning on having children

01:06:39.895 --> 01:06:42.125
with a woman
who I'm pretty sure I'll never see again.

01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:44.732
A few months ago?

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:46.266
- Yep.
- That's it, huh?

01:06:46.402 --> 01:06:49.838
And now I'm crazy about a woman
who paid me for my sperm.

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.601
How about that curveball?

01:06:53.042 --> 01:06:54.475
Bam!

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:58.671
Sebastian's gonna get through this.
We're gonna lick this thing.

01:06:58.814 --> 01:07:03.012
He doesn't need to have this dark cloud
hanging over his head.

01:07:03.152 --> 01:07:04.779
What do you think,
you want another beer?

01:07:04.920 --> 01:07:07.013
WALLY: Oh, the guy was just...
He just would not stop.

01:07:07.156 --> 01:07:08.851
He just kept going
and talking and talking.

01:07:08.991 --> 01:07:12.119
You know, he thinks that it's his kid.
He thinks that he's my best friend.

01:07:12.261 --> 01:07:15.697
Wants me to give him advice on how
to be a better father to my son, you know?

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.628
It's just like a nightmare.
He's e-mailing me.

01:07:17.766 --> 01:07:20.496
He's smiling at me all the time.
He's hitting me with the big teeth.

01:07:20.636 --> 01:07:22.900
- Wants me to go fly-fishing with him.
- Yeah, and why...?

01:07:23.038 --> 01:07:24.505
I don't understand. Why are we here?

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:27.609
Because I gotta exchange this frame.
Sebastian wants one from the new line.

01:07:27.743 --> 01:07:30.871
- It's a sterling-silver 5-by-7.
- Oh, I see.

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:33.675
Well, that's so nice that
you're taking an interest in his hobbies,

01:07:33.816 --> 01:07:36.614
but, um, listen,
I think the first order of business

01:07:36.752 --> 01:07:38.720
is for you to take care of this thing
with Kassie.

01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.515
Why are we waiting? Why the wait?

01:07:40.656 --> 01:07:43.022
Please, I know that, all right?
I've been trying to do that.

01:07:43.158 --> 01:07:45.854
- But everything is all turned around now.
- Turned around?

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:49.358
I'm turned around.

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:52.695
That night,
she said she thought we had energy.

01:07:52.835 --> 01:07:55.895
Ooh. That's a new twist.
Never heard that before.

01:07:56.038 --> 01:07:57.096
It was very weird though.

01:07:57.239 --> 01:07:59.264
Her mouth is saying
she's spending time with Roland,

01:07:59.408 --> 01:08:01.137
but her eyes are screaming, "Save me!"

01:08:01.277 --> 01:08:03.905
Ah. So go with that. Go with the eyes.

01:08:04.046 --> 01:08:07.914
And now I think
that I have feelings for her.

01:08:08.951 --> 01:08:12.648
Really? You think so?
It's only been, uh, 13 years.

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:15.488
Please, I know you've been saying that
for a very long time.

01:08:15.624 --> 01:08:18.092
- Now I'm finally saying it.
- Well, this is all good news.

01:08:18.227 --> 01:08:20.559
That's just... You're in love
with the mother of your child.

01:08:20.696 --> 01:08:22.186
Meanwhile, she's falling for Roland.

01:08:22.331 --> 01:08:25.164
And I know that I could save all of this
by just telling her the truth,

01:08:25.301 --> 01:08:28.168
but if I do that, I lose everything, right?

01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:31.471
And if you don't?

01:08:31.974 --> 01:08:35.102
Then I'll never be more
than Uncle Wally.

01:08:36.312 --> 01:08:37.438
That's no good.

01:08:37.579 --> 01:08:39.342
WALLY: Hi, excuse me.
- Yes?

01:08:39.481 --> 01:08:42.245
This is old, this is new.
I'd like this instead of this.

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:43.442
- Yes?
- Okay.

WALLY: Hi.
- Oh, thank God you picked up. Okay.

01:09:04.039 --> 01:09:08.942
- I'm in Michigan, and, um...
- Oh, at, uh, Camp Roland, huh?

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:12.741
Uh, yes, Wally, I'm with Roland.
He's got a cabin up here.

01:09:12.881 --> 01:09:14.678
WALLY:
Been in the family for 30 years.

01:09:14.817 --> 01:09:17.615
Yeah, yeah, it has been.
How do you know that?

01:09:17.753 --> 01:09:21.211
- He told me.
- I didn't know that you guys, uh, spoke.

01:09:21.357 --> 01:09:23.791

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:28.759
- What was that buzzing noise?
- I have to feed the phone.

- They don't have cell service up there?
- Well, apparently not on this island.

01:09:32.601 --> 01:09:36.662
So, Wally, Sebastian wanted to go
and spend the weekend with Liam.

01:09:36.805 --> 01:09:39.774
And since he's been having some trouble
making friends, I let him do it.

01:09:39.908 --> 01:09:44.845
But then Liam's mom called me
and told me that Sebastian has lice.

01:09:44.980 --> 01:09:47.949
- Lice?
- Calm down, Wally, it's lice.

01:09:48.083 --> 01:09:49.516
I did not say leprosy, okay?

01:09:49.651 --> 01:09:53.587
Would you please not Wally this
into a situation worse than it already is?

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:55.781
Hang on,
did you just use my name as a verb?

01:09:55.924 --> 01:09:58.757
Yeah, yeah, I did. I do that sometimes.

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:01.294
Listen, Wally,
can you please, please help me out?

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:04.922
I trust you, and you're the only person
currently in New York City

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.466
that he can stand.

01:10:06.602 --> 01:10:08.627

about this entire thing.

I'm out the first flight tomorrow.

There's no flights tonight, so I really...

- You know, I'm...
- Okay, all right. Enough.

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:17.271
I pick him up,
I take him to the emergency room?

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:19.438
You don't take him
to the emergency room. It's lice.

01:10:19.581 --> 01:10:23.073
Okay, so your place
and just plant him in front of the TV?

01:10:23.218 --> 01:10:25.413
- What do you want from me?
- Yeah, that would be great.

01:10:25.554 --> 01:10:28.717
But there's a couple more things that
you're gonna have to do before that, okay?

01:10:28.857 --> 01:10:31.519
Do you, um? Do you have a pen?

01:10:40.836 --> 01:10:43.236
WALLY:
All right, don't move, I'll be right back.

01:10:53.215 --> 01:10:55.706
KASSIE: After you've picked up
Sebastian, stop at Duane Reade.

01:10:55.851 --> 01:10:57.182
There's one on our corner.

01:10:57.319 --> 01:11:02.780
Buy a box of heavy-duty garbage bags,
shower caps, and the lice medicine.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.893

a prescription.

stuff all of his clothes in a trash bag
while he gets in the tub.

01:11:19.408 --> 01:11:22.206
Here we go. All right, arms up, arms up.
There we go.

01:11:22.344 --> 01:11:25.507
And now I'll get you to sit down over here.
We're gonna take off your pants.

Okay, real good, there we go.
And now let's get in the bathroom.

01:11:32.287 --> 01:11:35.415
KASSIE: Make sure he keeps the stuff
on his head for only ten minutes.

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:39.516
And whatever you do,
don't get it in his eyes.

01:11:39.661 --> 01:11:40.719
And while he's doing that,

01:11:40.863 --> 01:11:43.525
you can strip both beds of pillowcases,
comforters and sheets.

these few little things in here, please.

And let me get this.
And I'll see you in a minute, okay?

KASSIE: And then bag up all of
the throw pillows and stuffed animals.

01:11:54.042 --> 01:11:58.945
Make sure those bags are shut airtight
so those lice will suffocate.

Why does everyone ask me that?
