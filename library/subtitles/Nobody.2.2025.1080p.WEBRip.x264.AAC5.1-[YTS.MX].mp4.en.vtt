00:50:14.710 --> 00:50:16.943
So if I walk out of here,

00:50:16.979 --> 00:50:19.614
you leave me
and my family alone,

00:50:19.649 --> 00:50:21.406
'cause that's all I want.

00:50:21.442 --> 00:50:23.318

From the moment you've shown up,

00:50:29.156 --> 00:50:31.355
you've put my men
in the fucking ER.

00:50:31.391 --> 00:50:33.821
There's no way
you are just some family man.

00:50:35.357 --> 00:50:38.098
De-escalate? Fuck you.

00:50:38.134 --> 00:50:40.795
Plummerville was A-OK
before you showed up.

00:50:41.802 --> 00:50:43.666
Wherever I go...

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:48.143
I could so easily
kill you right now.

00:50:49.313 --> 00:50:51.179
But...

00:50:55.420 --> 00:50:56.844
You're lucky.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.221
You catch me on a good day.

00:51:03.492 --> 00:51:05.055
Go.

00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:06.920
Get the fuck out of here.

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.529
