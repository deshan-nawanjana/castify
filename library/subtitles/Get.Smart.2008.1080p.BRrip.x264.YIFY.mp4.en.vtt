7
00:02:24.455 --> 00:02:27.720
And this display is all that's left
of CONTROL, a secret spy agency...

8
00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:31.589
...which once battled against
the criminal syndicate known as KAOS.

9
00:02:31.762 --> 00:02:34.492
CONTROL was disbanded
at the end of the Cold War.

10
00:02:34.932 --> 00:02:37.924
Okay, up next, an exhibit...

11
00:03:44.368 --> 00:03:48.634
Judy, the elevator is still doing that thing
where it drops really fast.

12
00:03:48.806 --> 00:03:50.467
Are you sure Maintenance fixed that?

13
00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:51.972
Let me check.

14
00:03:52.143 --> 00:03:53.906
Yep, they fixed it.

15
00:03:55.846 --> 00:03:57.143
See you later.

16
00:04:00.217 --> 00:04:01.980
- Hey, Max.
- Agent 50.

17
00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:05.614
16 floors down,
how'd a fly even get in here?

18
00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:07.155
- Hey, Max.
- Max!

19
00:04:07.325 --> 00:04:08.656
Hey, Larabee, 91.

20
00:04:08.826 --> 00:04:12.387
Yeah, big day. Could be
your last chance to push a pencil.

21
00:04:12.563 --> 00:04:14.394
Field-agent test results are due.

22
00:04:14.565 --> 00:04:18.661
Oh. Is that today?
I wasn't really thinking about it.

23
00:04:18.836 --> 00:04:21.270
Can you imagine Max as an agent?
Little suit, little shoes.

24
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.229
Uh-oh. Two-nerd pile-up.

25
00:04:25.576 --> 00:04:26.978
- Move!
- Ow!

26
00:04:26.978 --> 00:04:27.478
- Move!
- Ow!

27
00:04:27.478 --> 00:04:27.705
- Move!
- Ow!

28
00:04:27.878 --> 00:04:30.642
Pretty boys. Nothing but empty suits.

29
00:04:30.815 --> 00:04:33.841
- Good morning, Bruce, Lloyd.
- Why would you wanna be an agent?

30
00:04:34.018 --> 00:04:37.784
I mean, lab guys like us, analysts like you,
we're the real soldiers.

31
00:04:37.955 --> 00:04:40.321
We're the true guardians
of freedom and democracy.

32
00:04:40.491 --> 00:04:42.959
And I hear we're getting
a new cappuccino machine.

33
00:04:43.127 --> 00:04:44.560
No, that's only for agents.

34
00:04:45.162 --> 00:04:46.288
Oh.

35
00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.103
Hey, Agent 23 is back.

36
00:05:10.388 --> 00:05:12.219
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

37
00:05:12.923 --> 00:05:14.823
- Welcome back, 23.
- Maxie.

38
00:05:14.992 --> 00:05:16.857
So how was the assassination?

39
00:05:17.028 --> 00:05:19.826
Maxie, you know assassinations
are specifically prohibited...

40
00:05:19.997 --> 00:05:21.862
...by executive order 12333.

41
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.001
23, you kill me.

42
00:05:27.171 --> 00:05:29.401
- I could if I wanted to.
- Yes, you... Oh. Oh!

43
00:05:29.573 --> 00:05:32.098
Did you see that face he made? Scary.

44
00:05:35.112 --> 00:05:38.445
Six months' work. 18 million dollars.

45
00:05:39.817 --> 00:05:41.751
Fricking agents, man.

46
00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.250
Come on, let's see it.

47
00:05:43.421 --> 00:05:48.222
A lot of chatter in this region
involves nuclear material.

48
00:05:48.392 --> 00:05:51.919
You may remember
from page 627 of my last report...

49
00:05:52.096 --> 00:05:54.894
...that there has been an uptick
in KAOS interest in nukes.

50
00:05:57.134 --> 00:05:59.967
To wit, I offer
the following conversation.

51
00:06:00.137 --> 00:06:02.298
What are you doing? Are you texting?

52
00:06:02.473 --> 00:06:05.704
Yeah, letting my fiancee know
we won't be able to get married in June.

53
00:06:05.876 --> 00:06:07.434
I'll still be in this meeting.

54
00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:09.971
Can I see that a second?
- Yeah.

55
00:06:10.381 --> 00:06:11.405
That's great.

56
00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.809
That's weird. You lost your signal.

57
00:06:14.985 --> 00:06:16.953
Sorry to interrupt, Maxie, go ahead.

58
00:06:17.488 --> 00:06:19.718
Next time use your own damn phone.

59
00:06:21.058 --> 00:06:23.151
Good morning, men. No, offense, Karen.

60
00:06:23.327 --> 00:06:24.589
Snappy tie.

61
00:06:24.762 --> 00:06:27.560
Sorry I'm late, but I just came out
of a budget meeting...

62
00:06:27.732 --> 00:06:31.725
...with our incredibly abrasive, dismissive
and sarcastic vice president.

63
00:06:31.902 --> 00:06:33.062
It's no problem.

64
00:06:33.237 --> 00:06:38.231
I have obtained a snippet,
at great risk to a busboy in Balahd.

65
00:06:42.012 --> 00:06:44.242
"Aftab, how is your coffee?"

66
00:06:45.216 --> 00:06:48.083
"Good, Dalip, it's decaf.

67
00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.216
How is yours?"

68
00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:53.515
"It is good also.

69
00:06:53.891 --> 00:06:56.223
How is your muffin?"

70
00:06:57.762 --> 00:06:59.127
Powerful stuff.

71
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:01.964
So "muffin," then, is a code word?

72
00:07:02.133 --> 00:07:03.794
No, it is comfort food...

73
00:07:03.968 --> 00:07:06.835
...and quite frankly, more
fattening than most people realize.

74
00:07:07.004 --> 00:07:08.403
Which begs the question...

75
00:07:08.572 --> 00:07:12.736
...why would two
hardened KAOS agents...

76
00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.708
...risk the carbs?

77
00:07:16.714 --> 00:07:19.205
Because they are under
a great deal of stress.

78
00:07:19.383 --> 00:07:21.044
- Hence the decaf.
- For Aftab, yes.

79
00:07:21.218 --> 00:07:23.584
Dalip takes his full-strength. Why?

80
00:07:23.754 --> 00:07:26.552
Because he has been sleeping
on the couch for three days...

81
00:07:26.724 --> 00:07:29.994
...because he called his sister-in-law
a "leathery hag."

82
00:07:30.194 --> 00:07:30.494
People often say things
in anger they don't really mean.

83
00:07:30.494 --> 00:07:33.019
People often say things
in anger they don't really mean.

84
00:07:33.197 --> 00:07:37.190
Leathery hag, fat cow, ungrateful whore.

85
00:07:37.368 --> 00:07:42.237
Just words, really, that shouldn't
be used against you in a custody hearing.

86
00:07:42.740 --> 00:07:45.971
Let it go, man. Those kids
don't even look like you.

87
00:07:46.443 --> 00:07:48.070
Can we put a pin in this, please...

88
00:07:48.245 --> 00:07:51.009
...and go back to Max's
extraordinarily detailed report?

89
00:07:51.182 --> 00:07:52.945
Thank you, Chief. All I'm saying is...

90
00:07:53.117 --> 00:07:55.984
...that until we understand
that our enemies are also human...

91
00:07:56.153 --> 00:07:57.814
...we will never defeat them.

92
00:07:57.988 --> 00:08:03.654
Yes, they are bad guys, but that
is what they do, not who they are.

93
00:08:03.961 --> 00:08:05.724
Let's continue listening...

94
00:08:05.896 --> 00:08:09.764
...and bear in mind that the next 100 pages
can get a little bit dry.

95
00:08:09.934 --> 00:08:11.731
Come on...

96
00:08:23.314 --> 00:08:26.306
Easy, Durat! This stuff is radioactive.

97
00:08:26.483 --> 00:08:28.451
One slip-up, and it's "ka-fricking-boom!"

98
00:08:28.619 --> 00:08:29.779
Shtarker.

99
00:08:31.121 --> 00:08:35.023
This is KAOS.
We don't "ka-fricking-boom" here.

100
00:08:35.526 --> 00:08:37.153
Sorry, Mr. Siegfried.

101
00:08:37.328 --> 00:08:40.764
Get it in the truck,
and let's burn this place to the ground.

102
00:08:40.931 --> 00:08:43.422
But if we have what we want,
why burn the building?

103
00:08:50.808 --> 00:08:53.072
Any more questions?

104
00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:18.293
Missed me!

105
00:09:20.638 --> 00:09:23.732
All right! All right! I'm out!

106
00:09:23.908 --> 00:09:25.899
He was lying, Max. It was a good shot.

107
00:09:26.076 --> 00:09:27.373
Thanks.

108
00:09:27.544 --> 00:09:30.240
I am so sick of training.
I wanna get out in the field.

109
00:09:30.414 --> 00:09:34.180
Give it up, 23! It's just you
and Maxi-pad against the six of us.

110
00:09:34.351 --> 00:09:37.582
Oh, gee, Maxi-pad,
I've never heard that one before!

111
00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:39.990
I never have actually heard that before.

112
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:48.225
23, you're bleeding.

113
00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:52.294
It's a knife wound from the last mission.
My blood gets pumping, it seeps.

114
00:09:52.469 --> 00:09:53.834
Hey, Maxine!

115
00:09:54.004 --> 00:09:56.734
Come over here
and we'll play a game I like to call:

116
00:09:56.907 --> 00:09:58.772
"Let's Go to the Dog Show."

117
00:09:58.943 --> 00:10:01.070
I put a collar on you
and make you my bi...!

118
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.118
I think I really got inside his head.

119
00:10:08.285 --> 00:10:08.619
I am not proud of what I just did.

120
00:10:08.619 --> 00:10:09.950
I am not proud of what I just did.

121
00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:11.747
Game over, Chatty Cathy.

122
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:19.761
Game over when I say it's over.

123
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:21.720
- Okay.
- Wet willy.

124
00:10:23.534 --> 00:10:25.229
Okay. Who wants lunch?

125
00:10:25.402 --> 00:10:28.769
Well, excellent work, 23,
but I could've handled it my...

126
00:10:31.875 --> 00:10:35.311
- Max, the Chief wants to see you.
- It is nice to see you too!

127
00:10:42.753 --> 00:10:44.118
You wanted to see me, Chief?

128
00:10:44.288 --> 00:10:46.756
Yes, Max, yes, please, sit down.

129
00:10:46.924 --> 00:10:50.451
Your field-agent test results
just came in and...

130
00:10:51.862 --> 00:10:54.524
- Something wrong with your ear?
- Absolutely not.

131
00:10:54.698 --> 00:10:57.132
Would you like me
to wait while you answer that?

132
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:58.393
Answer what?

133
00:10:58.569 --> 00:11:00.503
Nothing. You were saying?

134
00:11:00.671 --> 00:11:03.071
I was saying the results
are quite extraordinary.

135
00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.232
In fact, your essay on existentialism
was quite amazing.

136
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:07.934
I left that section blank.

137
00:11:08.112 --> 00:11:09.909
Blank? Brilliant.

138
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.570
Brilliant, Max.

139
00:11:11.749 --> 00:11:14.411
- You passed with flying colors.
- Yes!

140
00:11:14.585 --> 00:11:17.076
You know what, sir?
I can't say that I am shocked.

141
00:11:17.254 --> 00:11:19.984
I felt good about this year's test,
in light of the fact...

142
00:11:20.157 --> 00:11:22.853
...that in previous years,
my fitness has been an issue.

143
00:11:30.367 --> 00:11:31.391
Personal best.

144
00:11:31.568 --> 00:11:34.469
But not anymore. I'm ready for duty.

145
00:11:34.638 --> 00:11:36.765
I know how hard
you've prepared for this...

146
00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.737
...and how much this means to you...

147
00:11:38.909 --> 00:11:41.070
...but I'm afraid I can't promote you.

148
00:11:41.245 --> 00:11:44.772
- What?
- I can't afford to give up my best analyst.

149
00:11:44.948 --> 00:11:48.145
I mean, the amount of chatter
you get through, and the reports...

150
00:11:48.318 --> 00:11:50.445
...I mean, they go way beyond
the raw data.

151
00:11:51.155 --> 00:11:57.219
So to be clear, you're not promoting me,
because I do such a great job.

152
00:11:58.062 --> 00:12:01.498
Max, the way you and I work
is becoming a lost art form.

153
00:12:01.665 --> 00:12:04.463
I spend half my days
trying to convince the vice president...

154
00:12:04.635 --> 00:12:07.433
...that intelligence comes
from humans and not satellites.

155
00:12:07.604 --> 00:12:11.040
Men with hunches,
that's where the real work gets done.

156
00:12:11.208 --> 00:12:13.142
I'm very proud of you, Max...

157
00:12:13.677 --> 00:12:15.838
...very proud of you...

158
00:12:16.013 --> 00:12:17.878
...but I need you where you are.

159
00:12:41.872 --> 00:12:44.170
<i>I am sorry, but we can never be.</i>

160
00:12:44.341 --> 00:12:48.368
Despite today's setback,
I will at some point become a field agent...

161
00:12:48.545 --> 00:12:49.807
...and when that happens...

162
00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:53.245
...one phone call could take me
to the other side of the world.

163
00:12:53.851 --> 00:12:57.685
Who am I kidding? I'm a middle-aged
man who's missed the train.

164
00:12:58.355 --> 00:13:01.984
You don't deserve this.
I don't deserve you.

165
00:13:02.159 --> 00:13:04.627
You're so young and so full of life.

166
00:13:05.696 --> 00:13:06.822
Don't do it, Fang.

167
00:13:07.698 --> 00:13:08.995
Don't love me.

168
00:13:11.502 --> 00:13:12.799
Here.

169
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:14.938
- Oh, great.
- Sorry.

170
00:13:15.105 --> 00:13:17.573
That was my last mile.
I have no idea how fast it was.

171
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:20.073
You were moving.
It's not easy to knock me down.

172
00:13:20.244 --> 00:13:22.474
I have a low center of gravity.
Pretty solid.

173
00:13:22.646 --> 00:13:24.978
I'm just gonna call that one a 4:50.

174
00:13:25.149 --> 00:13:29.142
Impressive. I once ran a 5:16.

175
00:13:29.319 --> 00:13:32.186
Oh, really? That's, uh, slower.

176
00:13:32.356 --> 00:13:33.846
Not everything's a competition.

177
00:13:34.124 --> 00:13:35.853
Well, if it were, I'd win.

178
00:13:36.026 --> 00:13:38.221
Ah. Are you flirting with me?

179
00:13:39.296 --> 00:13:41.389
Not at all. Are you flirting with me?

180
00:13:41.565 --> 00:13:43.328
That depends. Is it working?

181
00:13:43.867 --> 00:13:45.698
Not at all.

182
00:13:45.869 --> 00:13:48.337
Well, nice meeting you!
I admire your focus!

183
00:13:51.942 --> 00:13:53.534
Am I invisible?

184
00:14:29.413 --> 00:14:32.211
Bruce, Lloyd, what happened?

185
00:14:32.382 --> 00:14:34.907
And what is that ungodly smell?

186
00:14:35.285 --> 00:14:36.582
Fear.

187
00:14:38.322 --> 00:14:39.619
I'll be back.

188
00:14:45.762 --> 00:14:46.854
Freeze.

189
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:48.327
Freeze.

190
00:14:48.966 --> 00:14:50.490
- No, you freeze.
- You freeze.

191
00:14:50.667 --> 00:14:52.794
- I told you to freeze.
- Freeze times infinity.

192
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:54.267
Oh, my God.

193
00:14:55.072 --> 00:14:56.471
- You.
- You.

194
00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:58.437
- Are you CONTROL?
- I'm Maxwell Smart.

195
00:14:58.609 --> 00:15:00.577
I am a CONTROL analyst. Who are you?

196
00:15:02.346 --> 00:15:03.904
I'm Agent 99.

197
00:15:04.081 --> 00:15:07.278
Oh, my word. You are Agent 99?

198
00:15:07.451 --> 00:15:10.181
- I am a huge fan!
- Thank you.

199
00:15:20.731 --> 00:15:22.460
What are you doing?

200
00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:24.656
I'm right here, just talk to me!

201
00:15:24.835 --> 00:15:27.269
I'm going to cause a diversion.
You run and get help.

202
00:15:27.437 --> 00:15:29.405
- I really don't think that that's a...
- Shh.

203
00:15:29.573 --> 00:15:31.507
- Did you just...?
- Shh!

204
00:15:49.693 --> 00:15:50.887
Go, go, go!

205
00:15:51.395 --> 00:15:52.419
Wait!

206
00:15:54.865 --> 00:15:56.230
Somebody shut it off!

207
00:16:04.207 --> 00:16:06.971
Good, 23, just in time.
I think I got one of them.

208
00:16:09.012 --> 00:16:10.604
Is that the Chief?

209
00:16:12.049 --> 00:16:13.676
Yes, it is.

210
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:15.078
Sorry about that, Chief.

211
00:16:15.686 --> 00:16:17.677
Is that a dent in his head?

212
00:16:34.571 --> 00:16:36.266
Hi. Hi.

213
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.273
Agent 13, you are in a tree.

214
00:16:39.443 --> 00:16:42.708
Yeah, communications got knocked down,
so they put me in a tree.

215
00:16:42.879 --> 00:16:44.870
- Old-school stuff.
- Glad to see you're okay.

216
00:16:45.048 --> 00:16:46.072
Yeah, yeah.

217
00:16:46.616 --> 00:16:49.949
Well, I have to get going.
Would you raise up the walkway, please?

218
00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.418
You don't have to get going.
You don't have to go.

219
00:16:52.589 --> 00:16:53.783
Yeah, I've got a meeting.

220
00:16:53.957 --> 00:16:55.549
- How you been?
- I've been well.

221
00:16:55.726 --> 00:16:58.456
- Everything good?
- It's great. Well, I gotta...

222
00:16:58.628 --> 00:17:00.220
Could you come back this way?

223
00:17:01.431 --> 00:17:03.092
Yeah, yeah, I think I will.

224
00:17:03.433 --> 00:17:04.764
What time?

225
00:17:05.235 --> 00:17:07.760
Well... Mm.

226
00:17:08.171 --> 00:17:09.900
I get it.

227
00:17:11.007 --> 00:17:12.998
Who wants to talk to a guy in a tree?

228
00:17:13.176 --> 00:17:14.473
I get it.

229
00:17:15.579 --> 00:17:18.377
Hang in there.
Don't cry, don't... Please don't cry.

230
00:17:39.403 --> 00:17:41.496
Okay. Let's get started.

231
00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:44.333
You'll have to bear with me,
I'm still a little fuzzy.

232
00:17:44.508 --> 00:17:46.976
I got a pretty good
hit in the head yesterday.

233
00:17:47.144 --> 00:17:51.137
Yes, it was dark in there.
You probably tripped.

234
00:17:51.314 --> 00:17:54.374
I hurt my knee. It was smoky too.

235
00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:57.878
All right, here's what we know.

236
00:17:58.054 --> 00:18:00.852
Wait. Chief, I request
the cone of silence.

237
00:18:01.024 --> 00:18:04.755
Max, not the cone of silence.
We're in a safe room, for God's sakes.

238
00:18:04.928 --> 00:18:06.520
We thought CONTROL was safe.

239
00:18:07.297 --> 00:18:08.628
Okay. Lloyd.

240
00:18:12.569 --> 00:18:16.403
Okay, we have reason to believe
that our security was breached by KAOS.

241
00:18:16.573 --> 00:18:18.837
- You have to speak up.
- Can you hear me?

242
00:18:19.009 --> 00:18:20.840
- I'm not hearing anyone.
- What?

243
00:18:21.011 --> 00:18:22.945
- Can you hear me?
- What did you say?

244
00:18:23.113 --> 00:18:25.673
- Bruce, it's not working.
- It's not working!

245
00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:29.748
Chief! I hit you in the head
with a fire extinguisher!

246
00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:31.888
No, no, no, we're not ready yet.

247
00:18:32.055 --> 00:18:33.989
Okay. All right.

248
00:18:34.157 --> 00:18:36.421
- It doesn't work, get rid of it.
- Turn it off.

249
00:18:36.593 --> 00:18:39.187
This thing is no good.
It's a useless piece of garbage.

250
00:18:39.362 --> 00:18:41.523
- Turn it off!
- Larabee, you all right?

251
00:18:41.698 --> 00:18:43.632
Larabee wants out!

252
00:18:48.371 --> 00:18:51.169
Today's the day, and we're gonna
get rid of this damn thing.

253
00:18:51.341 --> 00:18:53.935
- That is cold. That's cold.
- All right, easy.

254
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:55.737
All right, are we done?

255
00:18:55.912 --> 00:18:57.277
Yep. I can hear now.

256
00:18:57.447 --> 00:19:00.541
Sorry, Chief, someone led me to believe
the cone was ready.

257
00:19:00.717 --> 00:19:03.413
For the record, I never actually
used the word "ready."

258
00:19:03.587 --> 00:19:06.147
"I'll show them the cone.
The cone's the shizzle."

259
00:19:06.323 --> 00:19:07.722
- You said that to me.
- All right, shut up.

260
00:19:08.425 --> 00:19:09.449
Listen up, people.

261
00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:11.958
There's been a rash of thefts
of nuclear material...

262
00:19:12.128 --> 00:19:14.562
...especially yellowcake,
over the last three months.

263
00:19:14.731 --> 00:19:19.361
Now, based on Max's intel, we were
able to get Agent 38 inside KAOS.

264
00:19:19.536 --> 00:19:21.731
We must've been close
to uncovering something...

265
00:19:21.905 --> 00:19:23.736
...so KAOS hit us and they hit us hard.

266
00:19:23.907 --> 00:19:25.675
They hacked our system...

267
00:19:25.876 --> 00:19:26.176
...and learned the identities
of all our field agents.

268
00:19:26.176 --> 00:19:28.576
...and learned the identities
of all our field agents.

269
00:19:28.745 --> 00:19:30.804
Around the world
our people are under attack.

270
00:19:38.188 --> 00:19:41.885
Our only lead is the maker of the bomb
KAOS used against us.

271
00:19:42.058 --> 00:19:43.582
Vladimir Krs...

272
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:45.694
- It's pronounced "Krstic," sir.
- Yes...

273
00:19:47.063 --> 00:19:48.428
Krstic.

274
00:19:49.933 --> 00:19:54.267
Yes. He is a Bosnian national, and one
of KAOS' favorite munitions suppliers.

275
00:19:54.437 --> 00:19:57.235
Unfortunately, we have no idea
where he is.

276
00:19:57.407 --> 00:19:59.534
Actually, sir, we do. He is in Russia.

277
00:19:59.709 --> 00:20:02.735
- How do you know that?
- It was on page 482 of my report.

278
00:20:05.081 --> 00:20:06.708
Doesn't anybody read my reports?

279
00:20:07.951 --> 00:20:11.409
All right, our mission is clear, people.
Find Krs...

280
00:20:11.588 --> 00:20:13.180
- Krstic.
- Yes. Find him!

281
00:20:13.356 --> 00:20:15.347
- Kris Kringle. Fish stick.
- Yes, Krs...

282
00:20:15.525 --> 00:20:17.117
- Okay, I got it, I got it.
- Krstic.

283
00:20:17.294 --> 00:20:20.889
Use him to get to KAOS,
then recover the stolen nuclear material...

284
00:20:21.064 --> 00:20:23.498
...before they can do something
less than friendly...

285
00:20:23.667 --> 00:20:27.626
...and maybe, if we're lucky,
we can apprehend the man behind it all...

286
00:20:27.804 --> 00:20:28.896
...Siegfried.

287
00:20:29.072 --> 00:20:31.973
Pictured here with his
number two man, Shtarker.

288
00:20:32.142 --> 00:20:34.975
How are we gonna do that
when our agents are compromised?

289
00:20:35.145 --> 00:20:38.012
Put me out there, Chief.
I'm not afraid to expose myself.

290
00:20:38.181 --> 00:20:40.240
Do you ever think before you speak?

291
00:20:40.417 --> 00:20:42.817
No, I just whip it out there.
It's what's best.

292
00:20:42.986 --> 00:20:44.647
Fortunately, we have other options.

293
00:20:44.821 --> 00:20:49.588
99 recently underwent massive plastic
surgery, so her new face is not known yet.

294
00:20:49.759 --> 00:20:52.694
We also have a new agent, Agent 86.

295
00:20:52.862 --> 00:20:54.124
Who's that, sir?

296
00:20:54.297 --> 00:20:55.924
It's you, Max.

297
00:20:57.734 --> 00:20:59.361
All right, Maxie.

298
00:21:00.637 --> 00:21:01.661
You did it.

299
00:21:03.607 --> 00:21:05.370
Lloyd, may I have the C.O.S. Please?

300
00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:11.374
I'm so happy!

301
00:21:11.548 --> 00:21:15.644
I'm so happy!
This is the best day of my life!

302
00:21:17.887 --> 00:21:21.323
Max, you didn't push
the button hard enough.

303
00:21:21.491 --> 00:21:23.982
- So you could hear me?
- Yes.

304
00:21:24.794 --> 00:21:27.160
- Right.
- Excuse me, Chief, just a thought.

305
00:21:27.330 --> 00:21:31.266
- I'm not questioning your judgment...
- 99, I insist on complete honesty.

306
00:21:31.434 --> 00:21:34.460
If you have something to say to me,
I wish you would just say it.

307
00:21:34.638 --> 00:21:36.970
Max has no experience.
I don't want him as my partner.

308
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:40.541
Well, that is a sucker punch
to the gonads.

309
00:21:43.046 --> 00:21:46.982
Hey, Max. We got you a lovely
parting gift for your first mission.

310
00:21:47.150 --> 00:21:49.414
Oh, a pocketknife.

311
00:21:49.586 --> 00:21:51.918
Not just a pocketknife, Swiss Army knife.

312
00:21:52.088 --> 00:21:54.579
Comes with tweezers, pliers,
a tiny magnifying glass.

313
00:21:54.758 --> 00:21:57.921
Fish scaler, a saw, a flamethrower,
chisel, a wire-crimping tool.

314
00:21:58.094 --> 00:21:59.959
- What was that thing you said?
- Chisel?

315
00:22:00.130 --> 00:22:01.893
Before that.
Did you say flamethrower?

316
00:22:02.065 --> 00:22:03.396
- Yeah.
- Check it.

317
00:22:06.036 --> 00:22:08.197
We also added a crossbow
that fires harpoons...

318
00:22:08.371 --> 00:22:12.102
...connected to spider-silk nano-thread.
Has the strength of steel cable.

319
00:22:12.275 --> 00:22:14.766
It's a time-consuming,
labor-intensive technology.

320
00:22:14.944 --> 00:22:17.071
The spiders
have to be individually milked.

321
00:22:17.247 --> 00:22:19.215
And they do not like it.

322
00:22:19.382 --> 00:22:20.713
No, they don't.

323
00:22:20.884 --> 00:22:22.852
Gentlemen, you're the best.

324
00:22:23.353 --> 00:22:24.377
Thanks.

325
00:22:41.438 --> 00:22:43.838
Ladies and gentlemen,
while you are in your seats...

326
00:22:44.007 --> 00:22:46.202
...please keep your seatbelts fastened.

327
00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:49.704
I feel really good about us as partners.

328
00:22:49.879 --> 00:22:51.574
23 says that's important.

329
00:22:52.315 --> 00:22:54.943
"Trust is a must." That's what 23 says.

330
00:22:55.118 --> 00:22:56.142
Does he?

331
00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:59.311
You and I share a bond, I think.

332
00:22:59.489 --> 00:23:03.653
We both know what it feels like to look
in the mirror and not like what we see.

333
00:23:03.827 --> 00:23:06.625
You with the surgery,
me with the weight loss.

334
00:23:06.896 --> 00:23:08.887
I wanna show you something.

335
00:23:13.069 --> 00:23:14.161
That was me.

336
00:23:14.337 --> 00:23:16.237
Wow, impressive.

337
00:23:16.406 --> 00:23:18.067
Congratulations.

338
00:23:18.241 --> 00:23:19.731
Thank you.

339
00:23:22.345 --> 00:23:25.280
This is me.

340
00:23:26.116 --> 00:23:27.845
Wow.

341
00:23:28.017 --> 00:23:29.917
Very impressive, 99.

342
00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:33.180
You were truly hideous back then.

343
00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:38.284
Since we are going
to be portraying husband and wife...

344
00:23:38.461 --> 00:23:40.827
...maybe we should get our story set.

345
00:23:41.164 --> 00:23:42.654
Okay, good idea.

346
00:23:44.534 --> 00:23:49.028
We met at a marketing convention in Vegas.
Married a year later. No kids.

347
00:23:49.205 --> 00:23:51.105
I like your parents, but you hate mine.

348
00:23:51.274 --> 00:23:52.639
Do we want kids?

349
00:23:52.809 --> 00:23:55.676
Well, you do,
but I'm concentrating on my career.

350
00:23:55.845 --> 00:23:58.609
I don't know if that's fair.
I mean, I'm older than you are.

351
00:23:58.782 --> 00:24:01.808
- Well, not by much.
- Really?

352
00:24:03.386 --> 00:24:06.719
When they gave me a new face,
I had them...

353
00:24:07.557 --> 00:24:09.650
...take a couple years off.

354
00:24:09.826 --> 00:24:11.316
You know, why not?

355
00:24:12.162 --> 00:24:16.861
Well, if that's the case, then you are
at an advanced age, and you should be...

356
00:24:17.033 --> 00:24:18.830
Well, no. I was never...

357
00:24:19.002 --> 00:24:23.200
I'm just saying that your eggs could dry up
and fall out of your uterus.

358
00:24:23.373 --> 00:24:25.739
So time is of the essence.

359
00:24:26.843 --> 00:24:29.812
- That's your opinion.
- No, that is a medical fact.

360
00:24:29.979 --> 00:24:32.675
There is a lot of time
for me to make this decision.

361
00:24:32.849 --> 00:24:35.249
I will not be rushed into it
by you or my mother.

362
00:24:35.418 --> 00:24:37.852
- You don't have much time.
- Where is the drink cart?

363
00:24:42.559 --> 00:24:43.548
Uh-oh.

364
00:24:43.726 --> 00:24:45.489
- What?
- Six o'clock.

365
00:24:46.362 --> 00:24:49.957
Don't turn around, don't turn around.
Use your peripherals.

366
00:24:54.404 --> 00:24:55.735
Do you see him?

367
00:24:56.005 --> 00:24:59.270
I'm just widening my eyes.
I'm not actually seeing anything more.

368
00:24:59.442 --> 00:25:01.876
The big guy that might as well
be holding up a sign:

369
00:25:02.045 --> 00:25:03.842
"I'm an assassin, here to kill you."

370
00:25:04.013 --> 00:25:06.413
Okay, 99, you know what?
That is profiling.

371
00:25:06.583 --> 00:25:11.213
Just because he is large doesn't
necessarily mean that he is a bad guy.

372
00:25:13.122 --> 00:25:15.682
Oh. Wow.

373
00:25:15.859 --> 00:25:18.953
That's a bad guy.
That's a really bad guy.

374
00:25:19.128 --> 00:25:20.891
- You don't say.
- Did you see his face?

375
00:25:21.064 --> 00:25:22.088
Yes.

376
00:25:22.265 --> 00:25:25.632
His head looks like
one of the Easter Island heads.

377
00:25:27.871 --> 00:25:29.862
You know what?
I'm doing the same thing.

378
00:25:30.039 --> 00:25:32.906
That's profiling,
and I will have none of it.

379
00:25:33.076 --> 00:25:36.910
Darn it, I have gum on my new shoes.

380
00:25:41.918 --> 00:25:44.250
- He's trying to light his shoe.
- It's a shoe bomb!

381
00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:45.682
- Get him!
- It's gum.

382
00:25:45.855 --> 00:25:49.347
- He's got a gun!
- Not... Gum! Not... No! Gum!

383
00:25:52.562 --> 00:25:54.120
Gum!

384
00:25:54.297 --> 00:25:56.322
Federal marshal, you're under arrest.

385
00:25:56.499 --> 00:25:59.900
Sir, I believe you just shattered
my coccyx.

386
00:26:01.204 --> 00:26:03.934
<i>Folks, we may
be experiencing a little turbulence.</i>

387
00:26:04.107 --> 00:26:06.667
<i>The "fasten seatbelt" sign
has been turned on.</i>

388
00:26:08.511 --> 00:26:11.275
Well, you were no help whatsoever.

389
00:26:11.447 --> 00:26:15.144
How could I help?
I'm just a woman with a dusty old uterus.

390
00:26:15.318 --> 00:26:17.616
I never said dusty.

391
00:26:18.254 --> 00:26:20.313
We're close to the drop site.
I'll go first.

392
00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.516
- Gonna be all right with your cuffs?
- No cuffs can contain me.

393
00:26:25.328 --> 00:26:27.319
Excuse me, violent sky marshal.

394
00:26:28.264 --> 00:26:29.492
What do you want?

395
00:26:29.666 --> 00:26:31.133
I have to squeeze the lemon.

396
00:26:31.301 --> 00:26:32.791
Ugh.

397
00:26:33.269 --> 00:26:34.668
You heard me.

398
00:26:34.837 --> 00:26:37.032
Squeeze the lemon.

399
00:26:50.153 --> 00:26:53.554
- Do you work out?
- Occasionally.

400
00:26:53.723 --> 00:26:55.884
Yeah, I'm big on protein. Protein's great.

401
00:27:09.005 --> 00:27:11.872
I gotta get it out. I gotta get that out!

402
00:27:13.843 --> 00:27:16.744
That's in there, that's in there.

403
00:27:25.521 --> 00:27:27.182
No time for pain.

404
00:27:27.357 --> 00:27:29.052
Over the drop zone.

405
00:27:35.264 --> 00:27:37.095
Ball sack!

406
00:27:46.576 --> 00:27:48.203
Son of a hamster.

407
00:27:48.378 --> 00:27:50.608
You all right in there?
- Yeah. Yes, I am.

408
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:52.040
Everything's fine.

409
00:27:52.215 --> 00:27:54.274
Mother of pearl!

410
00:28:01.624 --> 00:28:03.182
That burns!

411
00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:04.690
Last chance.

412
00:28:08.264 --> 00:28:11.961
<i>Airlock activated. Three, two, one.</i>

413
00:28:16.539 --> 00:28:18.370
First package away.

414
00:28:25.948 --> 00:28:27.882
Absolutely, I love cats.

415
00:28:28.051 --> 00:28:29.075
- Really?
- Yeah.

416
00:28:35.258 --> 00:28:36.725
Damn.

417
00:28:50.306 --> 00:28:52.137
Second package away.

418
00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.594
Oh, good, you heard me.

419
00:29:15.465 --> 00:29:17.330
Third package away.

420
00:29:18.434 --> 00:29:19.458
Third package?

421
00:29:25.708 --> 00:29:27.835
99, Easter Island.

422
00:29:35.051 --> 00:29:39.886
- I'll be right back!
- Where could you possibly be going?

423
00:30:04.881 --> 00:30:08.112
Okay, never do that again!

424
00:30:08.284 --> 00:30:10.309
- Stop hanging on me!
- Never! Stop it!

425
00:30:16.659 --> 00:30:20.322
Max, I can't reach my reserve!
Do something!

426
00:30:28.004 --> 00:30:30.370
That would have definitely
worked on me.

427
00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:34.909
Are you crazy?
If I can't pull my chute, you'll die too!

428
00:30:55.097 --> 00:30:56.758
- Aim for the haystack.
- Stop talking.

429
00:30:56.933 --> 00:30:59.697
- Aim for the haystack, it's softer.
- Stop talking!

430
00:31:01.470 --> 00:31:02.869
You missed it.

431
00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:33.761
Okay, not to keep dwelling on this...

432
00:31:33.936 --> 00:31:36.268
...but that was some kiss.

433
00:31:36.439 --> 00:31:37.963
How did you know that would work?

434
00:31:38.140 --> 00:31:40.802
Have you kissed other men
who plummeted to their deaths?

435
00:31:40.977 --> 00:31:42.001
Okay, you know what?

436
00:31:42.178 --> 00:31:46.581
So far, our entire partnership has consisted
of me getting you out of trouble.

437
00:31:46.749 --> 00:31:49.013
Do you know why?
It is because you keep leading.

438
00:31:49.485 --> 00:31:51.646
So here's how we stop that. I lead now.

439
00:31:51.821 --> 00:31:53.948
I'm the one with experience.
You know nothing.

440
00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:55.814
I beg to differ.

441
00:31:55.992 --> 00:31:58.688
I looked up your field agent exam,
and I scored...

442
00:31:58.861 --> 00:32:00.852
- My what?
- Your field agent exam.

443
00:32:01.030 --> 00:32:02.793
I scored eight points higher than you.

444
00:32:02.965 --> 00:32:04.057
This is not a classroom.

445
00:32:04.233 --> 00:32:06.758
That's the difference between
an A plus and an A minus.

446
00:32:06.936 --> 00:32:10.667
- You'll get us killed if you don't listen!
- A minus!

447
00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:14.273
Okay, you're faced with an assassin.
What do you do?

448
00:32:14.443 --> 00:32:17.879
- I take out my gun, and I would shoot...
- You don't have a gun.

449
00:32:18.047 --> 00:32:19.810
- I did until you took it.
- Bang. You're dead.

450
00:32:19.982 --> 00:32:21.210
- No, I'm not.
- Bang. You're dead.

451
00:32:21.384 --> 00:32:22.646
- Stop shooting me.
- You are dead.

452
00:32:22.818 --> 00:32:24.786
- I don't like it when you shoot me.
- Bang. Bang. Bang.

453
00:32:24.954 --> 00:32:26.114
- Stop it.
- Bang. Bang.

454
00:32:26.289 --> 00:32:29.452
Stop shooting me more.
You already said I was... Hey.

455
00:32:29.959 --> 00:32:31.483
Throw out your manual.

456
00:32:31.661 --> 00:32:35.062
Out here there are no grades,
there's only dead, and not dead.

457
00:32:36.165 --> 00:32:40.192
You know, I am not completely
incompetent without a gun.

458
00:32:40.369 --> 00:32:43.395
I am a master in the art of Hwa Rang Do.

459
00:32:46.742 --> 00:32:48.869
- I was not ready.
- That's my point.

460
00:32:49.045 --> 00:32:50.342
Yeah, you know what? That...

461
00:32:50.513 --> 00:32:52.674
Hey, what was that?

462
00:32:57.753 --> 00:33:01.484
Max is halfway to Moscow. Don't tell me
you're still translating that Russian.

463
00:33:01.657 --> 00:33:03.215
They talk fast, it's hard.

464
00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.885
It takes like eight of these morons
to do what Max did.

465
00:33:07.063 --> 00:33:09.258
I can't wait till we finish
the Hymie project.

466
00:33:09.432 --> 00:33:11.457
All these stupid agents will be obsolete.

467
00:33:11.634 --> 00:33:13.124
- Bye-bye.
- What's a Hymie?

468
00:33:13.302 --> 00:33:16.396
Hybrid Mechanical Intelligence Entity.
Basically a robot.

469
00:33:16.572 --> 00:33:18.506
It's a stolen KAOS technology.

470
00:33:18.674 --> 00:33:21.074
Being reprogrammed. Top-secret.
Need-to-know.

471
00:33:21.243 --> 00:33:22.938
And you don't need.

472
00:33:23.346 --> 00:33:26.611
I'm a trained killer.
I can kill you with anything in this office.

473
00:33:26.782 --> 00:33:29.751
You wanna die by Post-its?
Because I could make that happen.

474
00:33:29.919 --> 00:33:31.614
And that's a slow death.

475
00:33:33.122 --> 00:33:34.453
Larabee.
- Yeah.

476
00:33:34.623 --> 00:33:36.352
- Were you the last one to use the copier?
- Yeah.

477
00:33:36.525 --> 00:33:37.685
You left it jammed.

478
00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:40.192
So? Why don't you...

479
00:33:40.563 --> 00:33:41.860
...unjam it?

480
00:33:42.031 --> 00:33:45.023
- Just open the door, read the instructions.
- This your stapler?

481
00:33:45.201 --> 00:33:47.761
- Yeah, want me to show you how to use it?
- No.

482
00:33:49.505 --> 00:33:50.529
Unjam that.

483
00:33:50.706 --> 00:33:51.934
- 23.
- Yes.

484
00:33:52.108 --> 00:33:54.633
- Can I have a moment, please?
- Sure.

485
00:33:55.277 --> 00:33:56.471
Yes, Chief.

486
00:33:56.645 --> 00:33:59.808
Let me tell you about a pattern
that's beginning to emerge.

487
00:33:59.982 --> 00:34:02.177
As a former field agent,
I'm very much aware...

488
00:34:02.351 --> 00:34:05.445
...of how difficult it is
to make the transition to office life.

489
00:34:05.621 --> 00:34:07.145
He didn't unjam the copier.

490
00:34:07.323 --> 00:34:10.588
We have rules here. If you don't
follow the rules, then what are we?

491
00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.924
I'll tell you what we're not. We're not
people who jam staples into people's heads.

492
00:34:15.097 --> 00:34:16.724
That's CIA crap.

493
00:34:16.899 --> 00:34:19.094
All right, look, Chief, I'm your best guy.

494
00:34:19.268 --> 00:34:22.760
I don't belong in an office making copies.
I should be out there with Max.

495
00:34:22.938 --> 00:34:25.372
Look, 23, no more stapling today.

496
00:34:26.809 --> 00:34:28.106
Just hold on.

497
00:34:34.450 --> 00:34:36.509
So how do you know this place?

498
00:34:36.685 --> 00:34:38.983
Well, as an analyst,
I like to keep my ears open.

499
00:34:39.155 --> 00:34:40.554
It's amazing what you learn...

500
00:34:40.723 --> 00:34:44.523
...listening to chatter.
In fact, Ladislas Krstic loves this place.

501
00:34:44.693 --> 00:34:49.630
As do many KAOS agents.
Cafe Minsk-Pinsk in Smolensk.

502
00:34:49.799 --> 00:34:51.994
It doesn't get any better than "thinsk."

503
00:34:53.369 --> 00:34:55.337
You see what I just did?

504
00:34:55.504 --> 00:34:58.132
I added an "insk" at the end,
made it sound Russian.

505
00:34:58.307 --> 00:34:59.865
Should've smacked you harder.

506
00:35:00.042 --> 00:35:01.373
Is that your default setting?

507
00:35:01.544 --> 00:35:04.012
Do you just punch people
in the face willy-nilly?

508
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.148
"It's Tuesday,
I'll punch Max in the face."

509
00:35:06.315 --> 00:35:09.011
"A box of kittens,
time to punch Max in the face."

510
00:35:09.185 --> 00:35:11.517
"I'm having bread,
time to punch Max in the face."

511
00:35:11.687 --> 00:35:13.211
You know, I love bread...

512
00:35:13.389 --> 00:35:15.721
...and I know bread
has a few carbs, but...

513
00:35:15.891 --> 00:35:17.950
...I've never really been afraid of carbs...

514
00:35:18.127 --> 00:35:22.564
...because it seems like no matter
how many I eat, I stay "thinsk."

515
00:35:37.813 --> 00:35:40.008
I'm sorry, are you talking to me?

516
00:35:40.182 --> 00:35:41.911
<i>No sprechen Sie Russian.</i>

517
00:36:25.995 --> 00:36:28.964
Boy, you know what? I will tell you,
I love your country.

518
00:36:29.131 --> 00:36:32.430
No more Communism.
No rules of any kind, really.

519
00:36:32.601 --> 00:36:36.264
I'm filling my suitcase with steroids
and art from ancient Mesopotamia.

520
00:36:36.438 --> 00:36:40.067
Ran over an old woman yesterday.
Best vacation I've ever had.

521
00:36:43.779 --> 00:36:45.770
Time to take my pill.

522
00:36:52.254 --> 00:36:54.586
There was a guy in the bathroom
who's really hot.

523
00:36:56.225 --> 00:36:57.749
Okay...

524
00:36:57.927 --> 00:37:00.054
No, no, no. Radioactive hot.

525
00:37:00.229 --> 00:37:03.494
Although he did have a certain
rugged quality that some find appealing.

526
00:37:03.666 --> 00:37:05.634
How did you know he was radioactive?

527
00:37:06.001 --> 00:37:09.493
My watch is a Geiger counter.
You don't have one of these? Huh.

528
00:37:09.939 --> 00:37:12.908
Listen, I think he was part
of the nuclear theft in Chechnya.

529
00:37:13.075 --> 00:37:14.269
We should follow him.

530
00:37:14.443 --> 00:37:16.070
I gotta say, Max...

531
00:37:16.812 --> 00:37:18.279
...you picked a good restaurant.

532
00:37:56.285 --> 00:37:57.377
Of course.

533
00:37:58.187 --> 00:37:59.620
Tripe soup.

534
00:37:59.788 --> 00:38:02.882
- This must be Ladislas Krstic's house.
- What?

535
00:38:03.058 --> 00:38:06.619
Tripe soup is his favorite dish.
It was in the mission dossier.

536
00:38:06.795 --> 00:38:08.888
Let's just see what we're
up against, okay?

537
00:38:17.473 --> 00:38:19.464
I didn't get to eat at the restaurant.

538
00:38:19.642 --> 00:38:22.839
And if you skip a meal,
the next meal you overindulge.

539
00:38:23.012 --> 00:38:25.071
- Well, let me. I've got nails.
- It's a recipe for...

540
00:38:27.016 --> 00:38:28.347
You owe me $3.

541
00:38:30.219 --> 00:38:33.382
More guards.
We'll have to figure out a way in.

542
00:38:39.294 --> 00:38:40.318
Miniature blowgun.

543
00:38:40.496 --> 00:38:42.691
You don't have one of these?

544
00:38:42.865 --> 00:38:46.926
These darts are tipped with a tranquilizer
derived from the skin of a lizard...

545
00:38:47.102 --> 00:38:49.229
<i>...known as los zapatos de la muerte.</i>

546
00:38:49.405 --> 00:38:50.497
"The shoes of death."

547
00:38:51.407 --> 00:38:52.704
Excuse me.

548
00:38:53.242 --> 00:38:56.439
They're 40 yards out,
that's definitely the edge of my range.

549
00:38:56.612 --> 00:39:00.275
I'm going to have to give this one
a little something extra.

550
00:39:15.998 --> 00:39:17.522
Wow.

551
00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.258
You look spectacular.

552
00:39:19.435 --> 00:39:20.561
Thanks.

553
00:39:20.869 --> 00:39:22.700
You don't look too bad yourself.

554
00:39:23.972 --> 00:39:25.234
Is that a wig?

555
00:39:25.407 --> 00:39:26.931
Yeah, it came with the dress.

556
00:39:27.609 --> 00:39:31.636
- How did I get into these clothes?
- That's not important. Let's go.

557
00:39:34.917 --> 00:39:36.214
Am I wearing boxers?

558
00:39:39.254 --> 00:39:42.485
For future reference,
I usually prefer briefs...

559
00:39:42.658 --> 00:39:45.092
...for their security and peace of mind.

560
00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.592
Going free-bird is not exactly ideal.

561
00:39:47.930 --> 00:39:49.591
I don't like it.

562
00:40:05.481 --> 00:40:07.415
There must be 200 people here.

563
00:40:07.583 --> 00:40:10.677
Finding Krstic will be like
finding a needle in a haystack.

564
00:40:19.595 --> 00:40:20.857
I'd love to dance.

565
00:40:21.029 --> 00:40:24.988
English? But you understand Russian?
Very impressive.

566
00:40:25.667 --> 00:40:27.259
Shall we?

567
00:40:28.103 --> 00:40:29.798
I hope your date doesn't mind.

568
00:40:29.972 --> 00:40:31.872
Oh, he's not my date.

569
00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:35.203
He's just a local horse groomer
I hired to drive me around.

570
00:40:35.377 --> 00:40:39.370
It's a tragic story. He's quite deaf.
Really not bright.

571
00:40:40.315 --> 00:40:43.876
I am going to dance now.

572
00:40:44.186 --> 00:40:48.122
You go get yourself some punch.

573
00:40:49.358 --> 00:40:50.791
Okay.

574
00:40:52.027 --> 00:40:54.495
I don't even know
how much gets through.

575
00:41:03.372 --> 00:41:04.862
Chief, I need your help.

576
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.371
You're on. Go ahead.

577
00:41:06.542 --> 00:41:07.668
<i>We have found Krstic.</i>

578
00:41:07.843 --> 00:41:10.403
<i>I searched his house.
I can't find his computer network.</i>

579
00:41:10.579 --> 00:41:10.979
Get me an infrared satellite scan.

580
00:41:10.979 --> 00:41:12.207
Get me an infrared satellite scan.

581
00:41:12.381 --> 00:41:15.475
I have to get back to 99,
she is in grave danger.

582
00:41:18.754 --> 00:41:20.654
Your house is so beautiful.

583
00:41:20.989 --> 00:41:23.389
It must be difficult to go to work.

584
00:41:24.393 --> 00:41:26.827
I don't have to go very far.

585
00:42:02.497 --> 00:42:04.226
I don't think so.

586
00:42:04.566 --> 00:42:06.124
I wasn't talking to you.

587
00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:11.429
Me?

588
00:42:13.208 --> 00:42:14.368
I don't know.

589
00:42:14.543 --> 00:42:16.101
It'll be fun.

590
00:42:16.511 --> 00:42:17.535
Trust me.

591
00:43:09.364 --> 00:43:11.161
You are so light on your feet.

592
00:43:11.333 --> 00:43:12.766
I recently lost 150 pounds.

593
00:43:13.101 --> 00:43:14.898
So did I.

594
00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:17.300
Isn't it great?
I have so much more energy now.

595
00:43:17.472 --> 00:43:18.939
Me too.

596
00:44:25.674 --> 00:44:27.869
- Thanks for jumping.
- No problem.

597
00:44:51.733 --> 00:44:53.758
Thank you for the lovely dance.

598
00:45:15.524 --> 00:45:17.389
Did you see anything
while I was dancing?

599
00:45:17.559 --> 00:45:20.926
Just once, but I don't think you expected
him to lift you so high.

600
00:45:22.297 --> 00:45:25.323
Anyway, I found out that the office
is in the guest house.

601
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:27.092
Really? How'd you do that?

602
00:45:27.269 --> 00:45:29.931
Show him a little decolletage,
cleavage, bat your eyes?

603
00:45:30.105 --> 00:45:32.096
I'm not judging, just detecting a pattern.

604
00:45:32.274 --> 00:45:34.640
- Ready to work?
- I'm ready to work. You ready?

605
00:45:34.810 --> 00:45:36.744
- Oh, my God.
- You're just having fun showing your:

606
00:45:45.253 --> 00:45:47.517
Six guards.
We are going to need another way in.

607
00:45:47.689 --> 00:45:49.850
Stand by, Max. Larabee, let's go. Move it.

608
00:45:50.292 --> 00:45:52.419
- What'd you do?
- I can't find the right screen.

609
00:45:52.594 --> 00:45:54.789
It was here a second ago,
then it went away.

610
00:45:54.963 --> 00:45:57.625
- What did you hit?
- Don't yell at me. It's not helping!

611
00:45:57.799 --> 00:45:59.266
If you don't find that screen...

612
00:45:59.434 --> 00:46:02.369
...I'm gonna have you hunting
for land mines, with a hammer!

613
00:46:05.373 --> 00:46:07.364
<i>Got it, Max. There is one other entrance.</i>

614
00:46:07.542 --> 00:46:08.600
What kind of entrance?

615
00:46:08.777 --> 00:46:11.678
The kind where you'll wanna
throw your shoes out afterwards.

616
00:46:12.347 --> 00:46:16.340
Oh, great, rats.
It's not enough that there's poop.

617
00:46:16.518 --> 00:46:21.455
You know what, I never saw James Bond
in rats or poop, let alone rats and poop.

618
00:46:22.324 --> 00:46:25.225
Look, a rat riding on a piece of poop.

619
00:46:25.393 --> 00:46:28.123
Stop it. It's just a storm drain.

620
00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.833
Here it is.

621
00:46:45.213 --> 00:46:48.842
Exploding dental floss.
You don't have this? Hm.

622
00:46:58.426 --> 00:47:00.326
Three, two...

623
00:47:00.996 --> 00:47:02.020
...one.

624
00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.547
Right.

625
00:47:32.394 --> 00:47:33.554
Come on.

626
00:47:50.712 --> 00:47:52.077
Are you staring at my butt?

627
00:47:52.948 --> 00:47:54.745
No, I am not.

628
00:47:54.916 --> 00:47:57.248
I might have been before, but I am...

629
00:47:57.419 --> 00:48:00.149
Now I am again. All right, I'm stopping.

630
00:48:00.322 --> 00:48:03.382
Pay attention to what I'm doing,
so that you can follow me exactly.

631
00:48:03.792 --> 00:48:05.054
Yep.

632
00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:27.744
Okay, Max. Little heads-up.

633
00:48:27.916 --> 00:48:30.976
High-intensity lasers. Whatever
part of you does touch gets sliced.

634
00:48:31.152 --> 00:48:34.315
One more reason
why boxers were a bad idea.

635
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:49.001
All right, so do I have to do it
exactly like that?

636
00:48:49.170 --> 00:48:50.364
Just come on.

637
00:49:04.085 --> 00:49:06.485
That's impressive. Wow.

638
00:49:08.790 --> 00:49:10.485
Careful, this one's tricky.

639
00:49:10.659 --> 00:49:12.126
Good.

640
00:49:12.294 --> 00:49:13.318
Very good.

641
00:49:15.530 --> 00:49:16.690
Okay, it's not that good.

642
00:49:36.384 --> 00:49:37.578
Max. Max.

643
00:49:37.819 --> 00:49:39.081
Stay calm.

644
00:49:40.989 --> 00:49:43.685
Max, keep it together. Keep it together.

645
00:49:44.726 --> 00:49:46.250
Max. Max.

646
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:49.421
Careful! No, no.

647
00:49:49.597 --> 00:49:51.497
He's nibbling. That's not cheese!

648
00:49:53.301 --> 00:49:54.529
Max, be quiet!

649
00:50:02.844 --> 00:50:04.835
Okay, shall we?

650
00:50:43.284 --> 00:50:44.774
Did I hear something?

651
00:50:44.953 --> 00:50:48.223
Yes, there were some
tap dancers in the hallway.

652
00:50:50.558 --> 00:50:53.652
Damn it. I can't get into their system.
Biometric security.

653
00:50:53.828 --> 00:50:55.591
If you don't mind, 99...

654
00:51:00.802 --> 00:51:04.898
The old "steam sticks to everything
but the oil from the last thumb print" trick.

655
00:51:05.073 --> 00:51:06.097
Here we go.

656
00:51:06.341 --> 00:51:09.572
- Shipments of explosives.
- Your boyfriend is a very bad man.

657
00:51:09.744 --> 00:51:12.907
- And a really good kisser.
- Ignoring that.

658
00:51:16.017 --> 00:51:18.747
Look at that shipment of detonators.
It's a little odd.

659
00:51:18.920 --> 00:51:20.820
Well, he is a bomb-maker.

660
00:51:20.989 --> 00:51:24.186
No. What is odd is that it was shipped
to a bakery in Moscow.

661
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:26.919
These detonators can also be used
for nuclear bombs.

662
00:51:27.095 --> 00:51:28.926
I think this is our connection to KAOS.

663
00:51:42.010 --> 00:51:43.534
I set that up.

664
00:51:54.355 --> 00:51:55.617
Let her go.

665
00:51:56.057 --> 00:51:57.456
No.

666
00:52:01.463 --> 00:52:04.955
I'm not totally incompetent
without a gun, you know.

667
00:52:29.691 --> 00:52:30.817
Thanks for the help.

668
00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.385
That's enough. Pity.

669
00:52:35.029 --> 00:52:39.227
I'm about to shoot beautiful woman
and her retard stable boy.

670
00:52:39.434 --> 00:52:40.458
And yet...

671
00:52:41.336 --> 00:52:43.531
...I will sleep like baby.

672
00:52:49.511 --> 00:52:52.036
- Not bad for a rookie.
- Not bad for an old lady.

673
00:53:02.724 --> 00:53:03.884
Siegfried here.

674
00:53:04.058 --> 00:53:06.185
<i>How could you possibly screw this up?</i>

675
00:53:06.361 --> 00:53:07.851
Krstic was a fool.

676
00:53:08.029 --> 00:53:09.030
<i>- And they got lucky.
- Who's that? Who's speaking?</i>

677
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.531
<i>- And they got lucky.
- Who's that? Who's speaking?</i>

678
00:53:09.531 --> 00:53:10.759
<i>- And they got lucky.
- Who's that? Who's speaking?</i>

679
00:53:10.932 --> 00:53:12.058
That's no one, sir.

680
00:53:12.233 --> 00:53:15.031
<i>They're heading towards you.
Don't disappoint me again.</i>

681
00:53:15.203 --> 00:53:16.693
Don't worry, sir. They won't get pa...

682
00:53:18.439 --> 00:53:19.531
Why does he do that?

683
00:53:19.707 --> 00:53:21.572
Don't look at me. I'm no one.

684
00:53:21.743 --> 00:53:23.233
And don't you forget it.

685
00:53:23.545 --> 00:53:25.775
Everyone here can be replaced.

686
00:53:25.947 --> 00:53:27.608
I even have backup for you.

687
00:53:27.782 --> 00:53:29.773
It's called a rhinoceros.

688
00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:58.408
I think it's time to find new wheels.
Pull over.

689
00:54:04.452 --> 00:54:06.818
I feel good about the mission so far,
don't you?

690
00:54:06.988 --> 00:54:08.250
So far, sure.

691
00:54:08.423 --> 00:54:10.323
I think we work very well together.

692
00:54:10.491 --> 00:54:11.822
Like at the mansion.

693
00:54:11.993 --> 00:54:16.123
The way I held that guy's hair
while you punched him in the throat.

694
00:54:16.297 --> 00:54:18.162
That was nice.

695
00:54:18.833 --> 00:54:19.857
Nice?

696
00:54:20.034 --> 00:54:21.695
Yeah, well, good teamwork.

697
00:54:21.869 --> 00:54:23.336
What are you doing?

698
00:54:23.504 --> 00:54:26.029
I'm just saying that I think
we're very compatible.

699
00:54:26.207 --> 00:54:29.643
I think that you are confusing adrenaline
with, I don't know...

700
00:54:29.811 --> 00:54:31.369
...some other kind of hormone.

701
00:54:31.546 --> 00:54:33.946
- No. That's not...
- Know what, Max? Just stop it.

702
00:54:35.116 --> 00:54:37.846
Let me give you a lesson
that I had to learn the hard way.

703
00:54:38.019 --> 00:54:40.180
You can't trust anyone out here,
not even me.

704
00:54:40.355 --> 00:54:43.051
I mean, you know,
I could be a double agent.

705
00:54:43.625 --> 00:54:45.957
The break-in at CONTROL
was probably an inside job.

706
00:54:46.127 --> 00:54:49.187
It happened just as I got back.
How do you know that it wasn't me?

707
00:54:50.164 --> 00:54:52.724
- What are we talking about here?
- Let's just find a car.

708
00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:55.562
Which one's gonna attract
the least attention?

709
00:54:56.070 --> 00:54:59.665
All right, well, we have
a couple Soviet-era sedans here...

710
00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:03.242
...we have that tractor, that cart...

711
00:55:04.045 --> 00:55:06.240
...and... That'll work.

712
00:55:07.248 --> 00:55:10.115
- No.
- Yes.

713
00:55:10.284 --> 00:55:11.683
No.

714
00:55:12.020 --> 00:55:13.214
Yes.

715
00:55:16.858 --> 00:55:19.850
- Oh, yeah, we are really under the radar.
- Will you relax?

716
00:55:20.028 --> 00:55:22.895
Since the fall of Communism,
everybody has one of these here.

717
00:55:50.324 --> 00:55:52.087
There's our little KAOS bakery.

718
00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:55.388
I don't have to remind you,
but this isn't like the last place.

719
00:55:55.563 --> 00:55:59.090
There's no party, there's no dancing.
Everyone in there is a trained killer.

720
00:55:59.267 --> 00:56:01.132
Do you understand? Okay.

721
00:56:01.302 --> 00:56:03.770
Did they explain to you
how your belt buckle works?

722
00:56:03.938 --> 00:56:06.964
No, but the technology for holding
up pants hasn't changed much.

723
00:56:07.141 --> 00:56:09.109
- Max.
- Hey, what?

724
00:56:09.577 --> 00:56:12.375
This one has a compartment.
Inside there's a pill.

725
00:56:12.547 --> 00:56:15.607
If captured, it would cause death
in nine seconds.

726
00:56:15.783 --> 00:56:16.807
Great.

727
00:56:17.351 --> 00:56:20.320
But how exactly do I get them to take it?

728
00:56:22.457 --> 00:56:26.359
- Not much of a laugher, are you?
- Here. Put this on.

729
00:56:26.527 --> 00:56:27.926
- On what?
- On your molar.

730
00:56:28.096 --> 00:56:31.224
It's a tooth radio. It sends sound
up your jawbone, into your ear.

731
00:56:31.399 --> 00:56:35.563
I can't hear anything outside your mouth,
so if you get in trouble, you have to say so.

732
00:56:35.737 --> 00:56:36.726
Is it working?

733
00:56:40.208 --> 00:56:42.073
- Is it working?
- Yes.

734
00:56:42.243 --> 00:56:43.471
Good.

735
00:56:43.644 --> 00:56:44.668
Okay.

736
00:56:44.846 --> 00:56:47.542
Well, you know what to do.
Good luck in there.

737
00:56:47.715 --> 00:56:49.376
You too.

738
00:57:17.545 --> 00:57:19.376
<i>Free rugelach?</i>

739
00:57:19.547 --> 00:57:22.311
No, thank you.
I am here for something else.

740
00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:23.947
Bread?

741
00:57:24.118 --> 00:57:28.054
- Something hot.
- We have rolls that just came out.

742
00:57:28.222 --> 00:57:30.850
Even hotter. Much, much hotter.

743
00:57:31.192 --> 00:57:33.353
I already have boyfriend.

744
00:57:34.162 --> 00:57:36.756
- All right...
- Although, I could make exception.

745
00:57:36.931 --> 00:57:37.955
No, that's okay.

746
00:57:38.132 --> 00:57:41.329
Sure? Flour sacks in back,
very comfortable.

747
00:57:41.502 --> 00:57:44.994
I don't think we are on the same page.

748
00:57:45.339 --> 00:57:49.298
I'm here because Ladislas Krstic sent me.

749
00:57:49.477 --> 00:57:52.139
Ah. Take number.

750
00:57:53.447 --> 00:57:55.516
But I'm the only one here.

751
00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:01.848
Oh.

752
00:58:31.452 --> 00:58:32.749
Who are you?

753
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.616
My name is Nudnik Shpilkes.
Who are you?

754
00:58:35.790 --> 00:58:38.384
- I am Siegfried.
- Did you say Siegfried?

755
00:58:39.727 --> 00:58:40.716
Max!

756
00:58:40.962 --> 00:58:41.986
Yes.

757
00:58:42.163 --> 00:58:44.063
I understand that you're
the man to see...

758
00:58:44.232 --> 00:58:47.292
...if someone is interested in acquiring
items of a nuclear nature.

759
00:58:47.468 --> 00:58:51.029
- How do I know you're not CONTROL?
- Lf I were CONTROL, you'd already be dead.

760
00:58:51.205 --> 00:58:53.139
If you were CONTROL, you'd be dead.

761
00:58:53.307 --> 00:58:57.266
Well, neither of us is dead,
so I'm obviously not from CONTROL.

762
00:59:01.007 --> 00:59:02.998
That actually makes sense.

763
00:59:04.343 --> 00:59:07.403
Follow me, Mr. Shpilkes.

764
00:59:13.619 --> 00:59:15.644
Test. Test.

765
00:59:18.858 --> 00:59:21.656
Ah. The "Ode to Joy"
from Beethoven's Ninth.

766
00:59:21.828 --> 00:59:25.821
Stone deaf when he wrote it.
Syphilis. Fun stuff.

767
00:59:26.465 --> 00:59:30.993
Yes, a personal favorite.
A bit familiar, but it ends with a bang.

768
00:59:32.338 --> 00:59:33.828
You're doing great, Max.

769
00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:38.067
What I'm about to show you is
the inner sanctum of our entire operation.

770
00:59:38.244 --> 00:59:40.769
The inner sanctum
of the entire operation?

771
00:59:44.650 --> 00:59:45.708
Yes.

772
00:59:54.594 --> 00:59:56.061
This is it?

773
00:59:56.229 --> 00:59:57.662
Of course not. I lied.

774
00:59:57.830 --> 00:59:59.127
He does that.

775
00:59:59.298 --> 01:00:02.267
I'm going to kill you,
and then I'm going to kill your partner.

776
01:00:02.435 --> 01:00:04.198
I don't know who you're talking about.

777
01:00:09.408 --> 01:00:13.003
Ah. Mrs. Shpilkes must be lost.

778
01:00:13.179 --> 01:00:16.444
I think it's only fair to warn you,
this facility is surrounded...

779
01:00:16.616 --> 01:00:19.517
...by a highly trained team
of 130 Black Op snipers.

780
01:00:19.685 --> 01:00:21.653
- I don't believe you.
- Would you believe...

781
01:00:21.821 --> 01:00:23.812
...two dozen Delta Force commandos?

782
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:26.515
- No.
- How about Chuck Norris with a BB gun?

783
01:00:27.093 --> 01:00:28.526
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.

784
01:00:31.197 --> 01:00:34.894
Well, Mr. Shtarker,
I think you've underestimated me...

785
01:00:35.067 --> 01:00:37.058
...and the element of surpr...!

786
01:00:47.146 --> 01:00:49.876
99, we've been compromised. Get out.

787
01:01:09.769 --> 01:01:11.464
<i>Access denied.</i>

788
01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:43.825
<i>Access denied. Access denied.</i>

789
01:01:44.003 --> 01:01:46.471
<i>Access denied.</i>

790
01:01:59.518 --> 01:02:00.542
Max, where are you?

791
01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:02.950
99, I found the yellowcake.

792
01:02:03.122 --> 01:02:04.783
Of course you did, it's a bakery.

793
01:02:04.957 --> 01:02:07.619
No, not yellow "cake" cake,
yellowcake uranium.

794
01:02:07.793 --> 01:02:12.287
Although there is yellow "cake" cake
here as well.

795
01:02:13.132 --> 01:02:14.394
Oh, Max.

796
01:02:42.128 --> 01:02:43.755
Max, do you read...?

797
01:02:43.929 --> 01:02:45.191
99!

798
01:02:45.364 --> 01:02:47.195
What happened to your radio?

799
01:02:47.366 --> 01:02:50.358
I swallowed it. I can get it back,
but you may not want it.

800
01:02:50.536 --> 01:02:52.338
- Good Lord.
- Listen...

801
01:02:52.538 --> 01:02:52.838
...I've placed charges
at points all over the building.

802
01:02:52.838 --> 01:02:55.068
...I've placed charges
at points all over the building.

803
01:02:55.241 --> 01:02:58.938
What? Max, you can't blow up a building
full of radioactive material!

804
01:02:59.111 --> 01:03:03.013
I know that, 99. I've placed only enough
charges to safely bury the weapons lab.

805
01:03:04.050 --> 01:03:05.244
Max, that's brilliant.

806
01:03:05.418 --> 01:03:09.218
Wow. That's maybe the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

807
01:03:37.616 --> 01:03:41.552
- I don't get it, I thought he was dead!
- I will say this, he is not a quitter.

808
01:03:58.037 --> 01:04:00.539
This is just ridiculous!

809
01:04:06.779 --> 01:04:07.803
99!

810
01:04:07.980 --> 01:04:09.106
Wake up, 99.

811
01:04:09.281 --> 01:04:11.442
Maybe you should kiss him again.

812
01:04:14.386 --> 01:04:17.685
Wait, I know that voice.
The chatter! Dalip.

813
01:04:25.464 --> 01:04:26.658
Ow! That was me!

814
01:04:30.569 --> 01:04:32.571
- Max?
- I'm... Yep, still fighting.

815
01:04:51.690 --> 01:04:56.150
Now, Dalip, I can prove that I know you.
Your favorite dish is chicken tikka!

816
01:04:56.929 --> 01:04:59.955
<i>Like me, you enjoy
American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest.</i>

817
01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.114
Ow.

818
01:05:15.114 --> 01:05:15.614
Ow.

819
01:05:15.614 --> 01:05:15.909
Ow.

820
01:05:25.658 --> 01:05:28.821
Wait, wait, Dalip,
there's something else that I know.

821
01:05:28.994 --> 01:05:30.154
Max. Max.

822
01:05:30.329 --> 01:05:34.060
Your marriage is in trouble.
Your darling wife, Zeenat, is leaving you.

823
01:05:34.667 --> 01:05:36.862
But there is still hope.

824
01:05:37.036 --> 01:05:38.503
Do you love her?

825
01:05:43.742 --> 01:05:47.576
- Wha...?
- Then show her. Go home for lunch.

826
01:05:47.746 --> 01:05:50.306
Take her with you the next time
you go to kill someone.

827
01:05:50.716 --> 01:05:52.308
She just wants to be with you...

828
01:05:52.484 --> 01:05:54.748
...and that means
less time with her sister...

829
01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:57.616
...who we both know is undermining
your relationship.

830
01:05:58.457 --> 01:06:00.891
Kick the gun to me.

831
01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.618
99, please.

832
01:06:03.362 --> 01:06:04.920
Big people feel pain too.

833
01:06:17.076 --> 01:06:18.407
What are you doing?

834
01:06:19.211 --> 01:06:21.611
Oh, no. Oh, no.

835
01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.407
Max!

836
01:06:25.784 --> 01:06:30.414
Okay. Okay. That's all right. That's okay.

837
01:06:32.524 --> 01:06:35.687
Her sister's such a bitch.

838
01:06:43.235 --> 01:06:45.533
- You all right?
- Yeah. That was amazing.

839
01:06:46.839 --> 01:06:48.204
Thank you.

840
01:06:50.309 --> 01:06:51.833
We gotta go.

841
01:07:00.386 --> 01:07:01.410
99.

842
01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:10.956
- What was that?
- I cramped up.

843
01:07:13.465 --> 01:07:14.955
Come on. Come here.

844
01:07:15.334 --> 01:07:16.995
Good idea.

845
01:07:17.169 --> 01:07:20.900
We will climb up with you,
and we'll all go... together.

846
01:07:30.883 --> 01:07:32.214
He left us here.

847
01:07:32.551 --> 01:07:34.178
What a douche.

848
01:07:51.904 --> 01:07:54.805
Missed it by that much.

849
01:07:58.610 --> 01:08:01.545
Well, that's convenient. Shoot them.

850
01:08:10.055 --> 01:08:12.353
Whatever you do, 99, don't look down!

851
01:08:12.524 --> 01:08:16.153
I'm gonna try to get us over to that ledge!
We can do this, 99!

852
01:08:17.496 --> 01:08:18.554
Max.

853
01:08:19.198 --> 01:08:20.222
Right.

854
01:08:25.070 --> 01:08:26.298
Thanks, Chief.

855
01:08:26.905 --> 01:08:28.429
Okay, no problem.

856
01:08:28.607 --> 01:08:31.440
The Chief is thrilled.
He sent 23 out to observe the cleanup.

857
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:32.634
Great.

858
01:08:33.846 --> 01:08:38.112
Listen, is it possible that you could
answer a personal question?

859
01:08:38.283 --> 01:08:40.114
It's possible.

860
01:08:40.953 --> 01:08:43.046
Why did you change your looks?

861
01:08:44.189 --> 01:08:47.818
Oh. Um...
That's not really a personal question.

862
01:08:48.127 --> 01:08:51.619
Things from my non-work sphere
spilled into my work sphere.

863
01:08:51.797 --> 01:08:55.733
Facts became known, identities were
compromised, and I became a brunette.

864
01:08:55.901 --> 01:08:58.961
Wow. That is a great story...

865
01:08:59.138 --> 01:09:02.539
...in which you revealed
absolutely nothing about yourself.

866
01:09:07.980 --> 01:09:09.607
I blew a mission.

867
01:09:11.383 --> 01:09:16.047
I was involved with someone from work.
I lost focus. The mission blew up.

868
01:09:16.221 --> 01:09:20.681
I broke it off with that person,
but my identity had already been revealed.

869
01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:22.417
So I had two choices.

870
01:09:22.594 --> 01:09:25.290
I could either spend the rest of my life
behind a desk...

871
01:09:26.165 --> 01:09:28.133
...which would be like
eight hours a day...

872
01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:30.996
...of scraping a cheese grater
against my forehead.

873
01:09:31.170 --> 01:09:33.001
- Oh, you know.
- Yes.

874
01:09:33.172 --> 01:09:35.800
Or I could change my face,
so that's what I did.

875
01:09:38.644 --> 01:09:43.308
And it was painful,
but it needed to be done, and s...

876
01:09:47.753 --> 01:09:51.052
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
- Okay.

877
01:09:54.526 --> 01:09:56.790
I used to look like my mom.

878
01:10:02.167 --> 01:10:05.159
I used to look like
two of my moms put together.

879
01:10:43.408 --> 01:10:46.241
Sir, if I may ask...

880
01:10:46.411 --> 01:10:48.572
...how did you choose the target?

881
01:10:48.747 --> 01:10:51.113
- Why Los Angeles?
- Major city...

882
01:10:51.283 --> 01:10:53.148
...Iots of media attention...

883
01:10:53.552 --> 01:10:55.213
...and the president will be there.

884
01:10:55.721 --> 01:10:58.986
Still, it's too bad
about all the dead movie stars.

885
01:10:59.157 --> 01:11:00.454
Yes.

886
01:11:00.626 --> 01:11:04.995
What will we do without
their razor-sharp political advice?

887
01:11:09.501 --> 01:11:12.595
Oh, my God, have you eaten the crew?

888
01:11:13.105 --> 01:11:15.665
Oh, look, it understands.

889
01:11:15.841 --> 01:11:17.502
Get back to work.

890
01:11:33.759 --> 01:11:37.923
No, that's not possible.
No, no, no. Max said that...

891
01:11:40.365 --> 01:11:41.525
No.

892
01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:47.204
That doesn't make any sense.

893
01:11:48.974 --> 01:11:51.909
Yellowcake uranium, warheads,
an entire production line.

894
01:11:52.077 --> 01:11:55.046
There's nothing here
but what used to be a bakery.

895
01:11:55.213 --> 01:11:57.773
There are no weapons?
No radioactivity of any kind?

896
01:11:57.950 --> 01:12:00.714
Nothing. I've swept the entire area,
and it's clean.

897
01:12:00.886 --> 01:12:04.083
- But Max said that he s...
- Did you see the evidence yourself?

898
01:12:04.590 --> 01:12:05.921
No.

899
01:12:06.325 --> 01:12:09.123
No, every time he found something,
he was alone.

900
01:12:15.334 --> 01:12:17.131
What do you want me to do with Max?

901
01:12:17.302 --> 01:12:18.792
- Do with Max?
- Max?

902
01:12:21.406 --> 01:12:23.897
You were right when you said
I shouldn't trust you.

903
01:12:25.744 --> 01:12:26.938
Give me the phone.

904
01:12:31.249 --> 01:12:33.717
And who might this be? Siegfried?

905
01:12:33.885 --> 01:12:35.045
<i>Hello, Max.</i>

906
01:12:35.220 --> 01:12:36.244
Chief?

907
01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:40.453
Knockout gas, 99?

908
01:12:40.626 --> 01:12:43.993
Please. I have trained my body
to be impervious to...

909
01:12:44.162 --> 01:12:45.493
That's new stuff.

910
01:12:48.433 --> 01:12:49.957
Oh, Max.

911
01:12:57.376 --> 01:12:59.401
I'm very disappointed, Max.

912
01:12:59.578 --> 01:13:02.479
I thought you and I were supposedly
cut from the same cloth.

913
01:13:02.648 --> 01:13:04.843
How can you think
that I am a double agent?

914
01:13:05.017 --> 01:13:07.485
You lied about finding evidence
of radioactivity.

915
01:13:07.653 --> 01:13:09.951
Killed Krstic before
anybody could question him.

916
01:13:10.122 --> 01:13:13.319
There's a matter of your
stoving my head in with a fire extinguisher.

917
01:13:13.492 --> 01:13:17.429
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me,
because you were in a mini coma.

918
01:13:17.429 --> 01:13:17.793
I said I was sorry. You just didn't hear me,
because you were in a mini coma.

919
01:13:17.963 --> 01:13:19.658
You've made CONTROL a laughingstock.

920
01:13:19.831 --> 01:13:22.629
The vice president wants to shut us down,
you know.

921
01:13:25.404 --> 01:13:26.428
99.

922
01:13:27.139 --> 01:13:28.731
This whole week...

923
01:13:29.374 --> 01:13:30.636
...last night...

924
01:13:31.576 --> 01:13:32.770
...you know me.

925
01:13:32.944 --> 01:13:34.377
Apparently not.

926
01:13:35.180 --> 01:13:36.374
Oh, my God!

927
01:13:36.548 --> 01:13:38.641
You two? You and Max?

928
01:13:38.817 --> 01:13:41.513
You said we had to break up
because we work together.

929
01:13:41.687 --> 01:13:42.881
Oh, my God! You and 23?

930
01:13:43.488 --> 01:13:45.956
I am so sexually threatened right now.

931
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:52.920
<i>You have reached...</i>

932
01:13:53.098 --> 01:13:54.963
<i>... the United States
Department of Homeland Security.</i>

933
01:13:55.133 --> 01:13:57.601
<i>For threats against
the continental United States, press 1.</i>

934
01:13:57.769 --> 01:14:00.533
<i>For threats against Hawaii, press 2.
For threats against Puerto Rico...</i>

935
01:14:02.207 --> 01:14:05.643
You know, you're the only human being
I know who snores when he's awake?

936
01:14:05.811 --> 01:14:07.438
<i>If you're calling from a rotary...</i>

937
01:14:07.612 --> 01:14:10.206
Okay, today's threat assessment.

938
01:14:10.382 --> 01:14:14.876
- There are 72 threats on the list. Mike?
- Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

939
01:14:15.053 --> 01:14:18.318
Okay, we have a deteriorating situation
in Venezuela.

940
01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:21.050
We have a deteriorating situation
in Afghanistan.

941
01:14:21.226 --> 01:14:23.922
What about the deteriorating situation
in North Korea?

942
01:14:24.096 --> 01:14:25.961
- I was getting to that.
- When? Next week?

943
01:14:26.131 --> 01:14:28.463
Yes, next Tuesday,
right after I kick your ass.

944
01:14:28.633 --> 01:14:32.865
Gentlemen, when we argue,
the terrorists win.

945
01:14:36.341 --> 01:14:39.105
Anyway, last night at a private dinner...

946
01:14:39.277 --> 01:14:42.974
...President Kim Jong-il
made a very odd threat to, and I quote:

947
01:14:43.148 --> 01:14:45.742
"Make a pudding from the bones
of Americans."

948
01:14:45.917 --> 01:14:47.748
That guy's insane.

949
01:14:47.919 --> 01:14:51.946
Doesn't he know bones are crunchy?
Who'd want a crunchy pudding?

950
01:14:53.992 --> 01:14:55.016
War room.

951
01:14:55.193 --> 01:14:59.186
Finally. My name is Siegfried,
and I represent KAOS.

952
01:14:59.364 --> 01:15:03.562
<i>Over the past few months, we have
assembled a stockpile of nuclear weapons...</i>

953
01:15:03.735 --> 01:15:08.638
<i>... which we have distributed
to 20 unfriendly, unstable dictators.</i>

954
01:15:09.407 --> 01:15:12.672
For the moment, KAOS retains
the bomb activation codes...

955
01:15:12.844 --> 01:15:16.746
...but we will release the codes
unless our demands are met.

956
01:15:16.915 --> 01:15:17.973
What are your demands?

957
01:15:18.150 --> 01:15:20.209
200 billion dollars by 3 p.m.

958
01:15:20.385 --> 01:15:22.910
200 billion dollars by 3 p. M?

959
01:15:23.088 --> 01:15:24.487
<i>You seem a bit slow.</i>

960
01:15:24.656 --> 01:15:27.853
- Is there someone else I can talk to?
- Good one.

961
01:15:28.426 --> 01:15:31.156
Look, Siegfried,
we don't negotiate with terrorists...

962
01:15:31.329 --> 01:15:33.661
...and you're obviously bluffing.
Take a hike.

963
01:15:33.832 --> 01:15:35.459
What? Are you kidding me?

964
01:15:35.634 --> 01:15:39.263
You spent the morning talking about
pudding, and you ignore a credible threat?

965
01:15:39.437 --> 01:15:41.905
Credible? Come on.
KAOS has been defunct for 20 years.

966
01:15:42.073 --> 01:15:44.598
With all due respect,
the CIA knows nothing about KAOS.

967
01:15:44.776 --> 01:15:47.210
CONTROL has to be in charge here.

968
01:15:47.379 --> 01:15:50.371
- Like when you bombed that bakery?
- Muffins of mass destruction.

969
01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:54.411
That's it!
I've been waiting for this since Nixon.

970
01:15:54.586 --> 01:15:57.817
- Here we go.
- I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!

971
01:15:57.989 --> 01:16:00.048
- Okay!
- Okay! Come on!

972
01:16:03.361 --> 01:16:05.955
It seems like they don't believe you.

973
01:16:06.531 --> 01:16:10.865
Which is why we've arranged
for a little demonstration.

974
01:16:58.850 --> 01:17:00.647
Chief, you wanted to see me?

975
01:17:00.819 --> 01:17:04.220
Yes. You and 23 are coming with me
to see the president.

976
01:17:04.389 --> 01:17:07.119
- Can't you call him?
- Vice president won't let me through.

977
01:17:07.525 --> 01:17:10.358
I can't believe we have to go
all the way to Los Angeles.

978
01:17:10.528 --> 01:17:12.359
Why is the president never here?

979
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:15.090
I'm sure whatever he's doing
is vital to the nation.

980
01:17:15.467 --> 01:17:17.332
"Good night, moon.

981
01:17:18.103 --> 01:17:21.038
Good night,
cow jumping over the moon."

982
01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:25.339
Actually, I think you would suck
as my teacher.

983
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:28.001
Well, from wh...

984
01:17:28.947 --> 01:17:31.677
Hey, Smart. Happy birthday.

985
01:17:38.924 --> 01:17:40.687
I'm fat!

986
01:17:50.635 --> 01:17:52.068
Gentlemen.

987
01:17:54.339 --> 01:17:57.137
Oh. Good, the itchy kind.

988
01:17:57.309 --> 01:17:58.401
My favorite.

989
01:17:58.576 --> 01:18:00.373
Does this one also have smallpox?

990
01:18:03.548 --> 01:18:05.675
And that was a human tooth.

991
01:18:05.850 --> 01:18:09.547
<i>- American Top 40.
- With Ryan Seacrest.</i>

992
01:18:09.721 --> 01:18:12.554
<i>Here's a sweet dedication
from a little lady named Dalip.</i>

993
01:18:12.724 --> 01:18:14.191
<i>It's to her boyfriend, Max.</i>

994
01:18:14.359 --> 01:18:18.887
<i>"Meet me in L.A.
Things will be very hot. Nuclear hot. "</i>

995
01:18:19.064 --> 01:18:22.431
<i>I don't know, if I were Max,
I would get myself to L.A.</i>

996
01:18:32.243 --> 01:18:34.609
Hey! Dumb guards!

997
01:18:34.779 --> 01:18:39.011
Why don't you come in here so I can
make you my pretty little girlfriends.

998
01:18:39.184 --> 01:18:40.651
You'll have to shower for weeks!

999
01:18:42.887 --> 01:18:44.650
But you will never get the smell off...

1000
01:18:44.823 --> 01:18:47.053
You two seem very angry.

1001
01:18:48.793 --> 01:18:50.920
Thank you, sir, may I have another?

1002
01:18:53.231 --> 01:18:54.799
I was kidding.

1003
01:19:02.941 --> 01:19:06.536
9-4-3-6-8.

1004
01:19:10.148 --> 01:19:13.083
9-4-3-6-8.

1005
01:19:30.135 --> 01:19:31.898
Turn around slowly.

1006
01:19:34.105 --> 01:19:37.404
Guys, you have to believe me.
I am not a double agent.

1007
01:19:37.575 --> 01:19:40.066
- We never thought you were.
- Yeah, we love you, man.

1008
01:19:40.245 --> 01:19:43.009
Then what's with the firearm
and the freak-show expressions?

1009
01:19:43.181 --> 01:19:44.580
For the security cameras.

1010
01:19:44.749 --> 01:19:48.014
If it looks like we let you go,
we'd totally get fired.

1011
01:19:48.186 --> 01:19:49.244
Got it.

1012
01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:53.357
So where are the Chief and 99?

1013
01:19:53.525 --> 01:19:55.493
They flew to L.A.
To talk to the president.

1014
01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.060
I need to get out of here
before someone stops me.

1015
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:59.821
- Overpower us.
- Good idea.

1016
01:19:59.998 --> 01:20:01.659
Bruce, I will smash you in the face.

1017
01:20:01.833 --> 01:20:04.427
- Thank you.
- Lloyd, I'll simulate your disembowelment.

1018
01:20:04.602 --> 01:20:06.126
Ready? One...

1019
01:20:06.304 --> 01:20:08.704
Not yet! I haven't punched yet.
React when I punch.

1020
01:20:08.873 --> 01:20:10.238
- Oh, yeah.
- One...

1021
01:20:10.408 --> 01:20:12.171
...two, three.

1022
01:20:13.611 --> 01:20:15.238
- Wrong way.
- Okay, wait.

1023
01:20:15.413 --> 01:20:17.881
- Sometimes I faint.
- I'm not going to hit you.

1024
01:20:18.049 --> 01:20:21.644
No, but when I see blood, or when
I talk about blood, or think about blood...

1025
01:20:21.820 --> 01:20:24.482
There will be no blood.
Hang in there. Hang in, buddy.

1026
01:21:11.803 --> 01:21:13.464
What are you doing, dummkopf?

1027
01:21:13.638 --> 01:21:17.404
Running out in the middle of the road!
You could get hit by a car!

1028
01:21:17.876 --> 01:21:20.401
Well, that was ironic.

1029
01:21:34.692 --> 01:21:36.182
Chief, I'm not buying it.

1030
01:21:36.361 --> 01:21:39.353
With all our satellites,
there's no way anybody could possibly...

1031
01:21:39.531 --> 01:21:41.795
...have nuclear bombs
that we wouldn't know about.

1032
01:21:41.966 --> 01:21:43.365
"Nuclear!"

1033
01:21:43.768 --> 01:21:45.326
- What's that?
- Sorry.

1034
01:21:45.503 --> 01:21:48.836
Mr. President, if I could just
please show you some data, you'd agree...

1035
01:21:49.007 --> 01:21:50.531
Well, just back up here a second.

1036
01:21:50.708 --> 01:21:52.699
First thing I'd like to know is...

1037
01:21:52.877 --> 01:21:55.038
...what did the vice president
say about this?

1038
01:21:55.213 --> 01:21:58.944
I'm afraid the vice president and I had
a less-than-cordial encounter yesterday.

1039
01:21:59.117 --> 01:22:00.880
- Less-than-cordial, you say?
- Yes, sir.

1040
01:22:01.052 --> 01:22:02.076
I'll say.

1041
01:22:03.454 --> 01:22:06.150
The chairman of joint chiefs
sent me this little movie.

1042
01:22:06.324 --> 01:22:07.985
Put it right here on my cell phone.

1043
01:22:08.159 --> 01:22:10.150
Let me share this with you.
This is my favorite part.

1044
01:22:10.328 --> 01:22:12.819
<i>I got a new pacemaker, I can go all day!</i>

1045
01:22:14.699 --> 01:22:15.893
Oh, Chief.

1046
01:22:16.067 --> 01:22:17.227
Very sweet tackle.

1047
01:22:17.402 --> 01:22:19.893
Look. Look at the surprise on his face.

1048
01:22:20.071 --> 01:22:22.403
I probably owe you an apology
for that, sir.

1049
01:22:22.574 --> 01:22:24.166
No. Please, just save your breath.

1050
01:22:24.342 --> 01:22:26.606
But I have to agree
with that son of a bitch.

1051
01:22:26.778 --> 01:22:29.110
We cannot respond to every threat.

1052
01:22:30.481 --> 01:22:31.914
Case closed.

1053
01:22:55.506 --> 01:22:56.530
Max?

1054
01:22:56.708 --> 01:22:57.834
<i>Hello, 99.</i>

1055
01:22:58.009 --> 01:22:59.840
Trace 99's call, now!

1056
01:23:00.011 --> 01:23:01.876
<i>- Where are you?
- That's not important.</i>

1057
01:23:02.046 --> 01:23:05.948
<i>What is important is that KAOS has planted
a bomb somewhere in Los Angeles.</i>

1058
01:23:06.117 --> 01:23:08.085
We got him. He's still in Washington.

1059
01:23:08.253 --> 01:23:11.518
<i>Listen, while I was in my cell,
I had some time to think.</i>

1060
01:23:13.658 --> 01:23:18.721
<i>I realized that even though I was accused
of something I didn't do, I was happy.</i>

1061
01:23:19.163 --> 01:23:24.032
<i>Because at least for a little while,
I got to live my dream of being an agent.</i>

1062
01:23:25.036 --> 01:23:26.799
<i>And I got to be with you.</i>

1063
01:23:26.971 --> 01:23:29.804
<i>I learned that you have
a mean right cross...</i>

1064
01:23:29.974 --> 01:23:33.171
<i>... you are almost as good
a dancer as me...</i>

1065
01:23:33.344 --> 01:23:36.575
<i>- ... and you used to look like your mom.
- Max.</i>

1066
01:23:36.748 --> 01:23:40.081
<i>Please, 99. All I'm asking is for you
to look me in the eyes...</i>

1067
01:23:40.251 --> 01:23:42.845
<i>... and tell me that
you don't feel something too.</i>

1068
01:23:43.621 --> 01:23:44.781
Freeze!

1069
01:23:44.956 --> 01:23:48.722
Oh, Max. How could I look in your eyes?

1070
01:23:50.094 --> 01:23:51.356
Just turn around.

1071
01:23:58.770 --> 01:24:00.761
Why are you talking into your shoe?

1072
01:24:00.938 --> 01:24:04.339
The old "call forwarding
from the shoe phone to the cell phone...

1073
01:24:04.509 --> 01:24:07.842
...so you don't know where I am,
then I appear on the roof behind you...

1074
01:24:08.012 --> 01:24:10.003
...and surprise everyone" trick.

1075
01:24:10.181 --> 01:24:12.046
- Don't move.
- What are you doing?

1076
01:24:12.216 --> 01:24:13.240
How did you get here?

1077
01:24:16.421 --> 01:24:18.514
Do you have another one of these?

1078
01:24:22.327 --> 01:24:23.351
It doesn't matter.

1079
01:24:23.528 --> 01:24:26.497
What matters is that there is a bomb,
and I'm here to find it.

1080
01:24:26.664 --> 01:24:28.825
- How do you know this?
- I'd rather not say.

1081
01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:30.991
Max, there are millions of lives at stake.

1082
01:24:31.169 --> 01:24:34.366
If you have credible information
from a reliable source...

1083
01:24:34.539 --> 01:24:36.734
...I wanna know it,
and I wanna know it now.

1084
01:24:37.809 --> 01:24:40.676
I heard it from America's sweetheart,
Ryan Seacrest.

1085
01:24:40.845 --> 01:24:42.176
- Whoa.
- Come on.

1086
01:24:42.347 --> 01:24:43.939
It was a coded message.

1087
01:24:44.115 --> 01:24:47.482
Max, we're running out of time here.
What are you talking about?

1088
01:24:47.652 --> 01:24:51.486
I received a tip from a KAOS agent
who I befriended at the bakery.

1089
01:24:56.994 --> 01:24:58.757
I think we should trust him, Chief.

1090
01:24:58.930 --> 01:25:00.898
Absolutely, Chief.
I'm with 99 on that one.

1091
01:25:01.065 --> 01:25:03.863
Every time I look at Max's puppy eyes,
I'm a goner.

1092
01:25:04.035 --> 01:25:07.835
Oh, my God. You've really never
had anyone break up with you, have you?

1093
01:25:09.407 --> 01:25:12.308
Chief, you said that you and I are alike.

1094
01:25:12.477 --> 01:25:14.843
That we are both old-fashioned men.

1095
01:25:15.513 --> 01:25:17.640
Well, I have an old-fashioned hunch.

1096
01:25:17.815 --> 01:25:22.377
I have a hunch that you have a hunch
that I am telling the truth.

1097
01:25:23.488 --> 01:25:24.580
Max...

1098
01:25:26.023 --> 01:25:29.254
Any double agent who escapes
from a high-security holding situation...

1099
01:25:29.427 --> 01:25:33.022
...only to fall into the arms of
the people that got him in the first place...

1100
01:25:33.197 --> 01:25:36.997
...is either an idiot or not a double agent,
and I don't think you're an idiot.

1101
01:25:37.769 --> 01:25:38.793
Thank you, Chief.

1102
01:25:39.437 --> 01:25:42.770
Now, we know that the president
is in town.

1103
01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:46.740
- But what exactly is he doing here today?
- Max.

1104
01:25:46.911 --> 01:25:51.211
- Yes. We need to find out his itinerary.
- But, Max, the...

1105
01:25:51.382 --> 01:25:54.112
I know, 99. I need to go get a paper.

1106
01:26:03.494 --> 01:26:05.018
We're in position. More or less.

1107
01:26:05.196 --> 01:26:08.131
Roger. I have the whole
security system online. Just remember...

1108
01:26:08.299 --> 01:26:12.065
Yes, we know.
How about a little radio silence?

1109
01:26:12.236 --> 01:26:15.907
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

1110
01:26:15.907 --> 01:26:16.236
I wanna quit, but what can I do?
He's married to my sister.

1111
01:26:16.407 --> 01:26:20.867
By the way, I reviewed the security tapes
from the explosion at the bakery...

1112
01:26:21.045 --> 01:26:25.072
...and I know that you let those
CONTROL agents get away.

1113
01:26:25.249 --> 01:26:27.513
So unless you do your job today...

1114
01:26:27.685 --> 01:26:33.817
...your lovely wife, Zeenat,
will have eaten her last kebab.

1115
01:26:55.513 --> 01:26:59.415
<i>Blue team, check for access violation
at quadrant three, sector seven.</i>

1116
01:26:59.584 --> 01:27:00.608
Copy that.

1117
01:27:01.986 --> 01:27:03.146
Go.

1118
01:27:20.638 --> 01:27:22.333
That's it. You're there.

1119
01:27:54.105 --> 01:27:55.834
Door secure.

1120
01:28:28.372 --> 01:28:30.636
We need to get everyone out
and shut this place.

1121
01:28:30.808 --> 01:28:32.275
We've swept the building.

1122
01:28:32.443 --> 01:28:36.209
The Secret Service doesn't make mistakes
like the fabulous bakery boys.

1123
01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.314
Who told you about that? Who told you?

1124
01:28:38.482 --> 01:28:40.746
Take it easy.
You'll give yourself a heart attack.

1125
01:28:40.918 --> 01:28:43.546
And this day will not include
me blowing into your mouth.

1126
01:28:43.721 --> 01:28:46.713
- You want a piece of me?
- Come on, Chief! He's not worth it.

1127
01:28:46.891 --> 01:28:48.518
- Hey.
- I'm shaking. I'm shaking.

1128
01:28:48.693 --> 01:28:49.717
You better watch it.

1129
01:28:49.894 --> 01:28:51.384
Let me at him!

1130
01:29:00.805 --> 01:29:02.705
<i>From Los Angeles, California...</i>

1131
01:29:02.873 --> 01:29:04.208
<i>... we welcome you to a live broadcast...</i>

1132
01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:04.709
<i>... we welcome you to a live broadcast...</i>

1133
01:29:04.909 --> 01:29:06.900
<i>... of our concert for the president.</i>

1134
01:29:07.078 --> 01:29:09.546
<i>Dignitaries from around the world
have gathered.</i>

1135
01:29:09.714 --> 01:29:14.151
<i>We will be broadcasting from the Walt
Disney Concert Hall throughout the evening.</i>

1136
01:29:14.318 --> 01:29:16.752
There has got to be another way in.

1137
01:29:16.921 --> 01:29:19.822
Why are we even still here?
There are 50 other perfect targets.

1138
01:29:19.991 --> 01:29:23.392
The Golden Gate Bridge, Space Needle.
There's no chatter to support this.

1139
01:29:23.561 --> 01:29:26.359
And you know what,
I'm done with this. Stop!

1140
01:29:26.530 --> 01:29:29.988
Wait a minute, 23.
You're radioactive hot.

1141
01:29:30.167 --> 01:29:32.226
When were you exposed to radioactivity?

1142
01:29:32.403 --> 01:29:35.702
I just got back from Russia.
Half the people there are radioactive.

1143
01:29:35.873 --> 01:29:36.897
The bakery.

1144
01:29:37.074 --> 01:29:39.702
You said you swept the area
and everything was clean.

1145
01:29:39.877 --> 01:29:42.277
- I did, and it was.
- Really?

1146
01:29:42.446 --> 01:29:45.040
Was there anyone else there,
or do we just trust you?

1147
01:29:45.516 --> 01:29:46.540
23.

1148
01:29:47.718 --> 01:29:49.413
Your knife wound is seeping.

1149
01:29:50.021 --> 01:29:51.852
Sudden rise in blood pressure?

1150
01:29:52.023 --> 01:29:55.356
Perhaps you're nervous because
there is a bomb here and you know it.

1151
01:29:55.526 --> 01:29:58.984
And what is with the briefcase?
Could that actually be the football?

1152
01:29:59.163 --> 01:30:02.155
You mean the computer
containing the bomb activation codes?

1153
01:30:02.333 --> 01:30:06.201
Exactly. I have no interest in a real football
unless it is signed by Joe Montana...

1154
01:30:06.370 --> 01:30:08.565
...and I don't believe that's the case.

1155
01:30:10.307 --> 01:30:12.070
Well, 23?

1156
01:30:12.877 --> 01:30:14.902
You know what? We're out of time.

1157
01:30:16.414 --> 01:30:18.473
You follow us, she dies.

1158
01:30:28.292 --> 01:30:29.987
Stop this car!

1159
01:30:30.394 --> 01:30:33.795
Max! You idiot!
What the hell is wrong with you?

1160
01:30:33.964 --> 01:30:37.297
You don't just slap your hands
on a government vehicle!

1161
01:30:38.836 --> 01:30:43.205
All right, that's it! When we get back
to Washington, you morons are through!

1162
01:30:46.343 --> 01:30:49.801
Damn it. How have you gotten
away with this for so long?

1163
01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:52.346
I can't believe none of us saw it,
especially me.

1164
01:30:52.516 --> 01:30:54.916
Don't beat yourself up.
You'll be dead soon anyway.

1165
01:30:57.455 --> 01:30:59.514
Chief, he's heading
southbound on Grand.

1166
01:30:59.690 --> 01:31:01.282
Thanks, Bruce. Keep us posted.

1167
01:31:01.926 --> 01:31:05.555
<i>Hey!
CONTROL assholes who just stole my vehicle!</i>

1168
01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:10.167
<i>I know you're listening! You two dickwads
put one scratch on that car...</i>

1169
01:31:11.368 --> 01:31:12.733
<i>What was that?</i>

1170
01:31:12.903 --> 01:31:14.666
Sorry, I'm losing you.

1171
01:31:15.439 --> 01:31:16.463
What the?

1172
01:31:17.942 --> 01:31:20.433
All right, fellas.
20 dollars if you hit the car.

1173
01:31:22.446 --> 01:31:26.280
Chief, I have to say,
this whole thing really steams my clams.

1174
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:29.146
I cannot get over the fact
that 23 is a traitor.

1175
01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:30.719
Sand trap!

1176
01:31:30.888 --> 01:31:33.721
Now I know how you felt
when you thought I was a traitor.

1177
01:31:33.891 --> 01:31:35.153
Tractor!

1178
01:31:35.326 --> 01:31:38.193
I don't know how I missed it.
I'm usually very observant.

1179
01:31:38.362 --> 01:31:39.693
Swordfish!

1180
01:31:46.871 --> 01:31:49.271
- Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I don't know.

1181
01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:53.308
Were you thinking, "Holy shit, holy shit,
a swordfish almost went through my head?"

1182
01:31:53.477 --> 01:31:55.001
If so, yes.

1183
01:31:55.179 --> 01:31:56.476
Come on.

1184
01:32:19.003 --> 01:32:22.564
On behalf of the United States Government,
I hereby commandeer this plane.

1185
01:32:23.474 --> 01:32:25.374
The device is armed.
I hope you're moving.

1186
01:32:25.543 --> 01:32:28.512
Don't worry, sir. I'll be well clear.

1187
01:32:32.983 --> 01:32:34.917
<i>Chief, they're headed
southbound on l- 47.</i>

1188
01:32:35.085 --> 01:32:36.916
Thanks, Bruce. I got them!

1189
01:32:37.788 --> 01:32:39.517
I need to get down to that car!

1190
01:32:39.690 --> 01:32:43.182
No, no good. If I get too low,
he'll hear me coming!

1191
01:32:46.997 --> 01:32:48.965
I have another idea.

1192
01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:51.461
What are you doing?

1193
01:32:53.971 --> 01:32:56.667
Get back in the plane!
You're gonna kill yourself!

1194
01:32:57.975 --> 01:32:59.272
Hang on!

1195
01:33:15.793 --> 01:33:17.385
Hang on! We're going in!

1196
01:33:22.166 --> 01:33:23.292
Sorry, Max.

1197
01:33:28.906 --> 01:33:31.568
Tuesday's not gonna work.
Cannot do Tuesday, I'm already...

1198
01:33:31.742 --> 01:33:33.710
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Sean! Sean! Sean!

1199
01:33:33.878 --> 01:33:35.903
See how annoying that is?

1200
01:33:56.233 --> 01:33:56.667
See, this is your problem.
Some men like women more feminine!

1201
01:33:56.667 --> 01:34:00.125
See, this is your problem.
Some men like women more feminine!

1202
01:34:00.304 --> 01:34:01.771
- I'm not feminine?
- No.

1203
01:34:01.939 --> 01:34:03.065
I'm not feminine?

1204
01:34:13.984 --> 01:34:15.542
Freeze!

1205
01:34:15.819 --> 01:34:17.514
That was so cool.

1206
01:34:18.422 --> 01:34:19.753
Max!

1207
01:34:28.265 --> 01:34:29.289
Damn it to hell.

1208
01:34:39.109 --> 01:34:41.236
You know, I might be more help
if you untie me!

1209
01:34:41.512 --> 01:34:43.878
There's a knife in my right front pocket!

1210
01:34:50.354 --> 01:34:51.582
Stop it! Stop it!

1211
01:34:52.056 --> 01:34:53.080
What?

1212
01:34:54.325 --> 01:34:56.919
That's not my knife! That's not my...

1213
01:34:57.461 --> 01:34:58.758
I got it!

1214
01:35:05.469 --> 01:35:07.130
No, 99, don't touch that!

1215
01:35:10.474 --> 01:35:11.964
Oh, my Lord.

1216
01:35:33.664 --> 01:35:35.757
Yeah! The kid's still got it.

1217
01:35:41.572 --> 01:35:42.596
Max, hurry!

1218
01:35:44.675 --> 01:35:46.438
Hold on, 99!

1219
01:35:52.483 --> 01:35:56.351
Chief, we can't stop the car! We have
the football, but we do not know the code!

1220
01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.987
We need to figure out something!

1221
01:35:58.155 --> 01:36:00.988
These tracks are taking us back downtown,
towards the bomb!

1222
01:36:05.429 --> 01:36:08.296
We gotta get you out of there,
and you won't survive the jump!

1223
01:36:08.465 --> 01:36:09.489
I'm coming to get you!

1224
01:36:34.525 --> 01:36:36.584
- Oh, God!
- Hold on, 99!

1225
01:36:38.062 --> 01:36:40.860
It's not over, Max!
I'll take that briefcase!

1226
01:36:41.031 --> 01:36:43.090
If you want it, you'll have to take it!

1227
01:36:43.534 --> 01:36:47.061
- That's what I just said!
- I know, I'm just trying to annoy you!

1228
01:37:35.819 --> 01:37:37.719
Unusual but effective.

1229
01:37:45.496 --> 01:37:47.396
- You all right?
- I'm fine!

1230
01:37:53.704 --> 01:37:55.137
Max!

1231
01:37:55.873 --> 01:37:56.897
Max, your foot!

1232
01:38:02.846 --> 01:38:05.815
- I wish we had more time!
- What?

1233
01:38:26.170 --> 01:38:29.333
- Max!
- No!

1234
01:38:50.194 --> 01:38:51.661
Oh, Max.

1235
01:38:57.734 --> 01:38:59.224
No. No!

1236
01:39:04.875 --> 01:39:07.343
I wish we had more time too.

1237
01:39:10.047 --> 01:39:11.844
So you did hear me?

1238
01:39:14.651 --> 01:39:15.675
Max?

1239
01:39:19.856 --> 01:39:21.687
But the train...

1240
01:39:22.693 --> 01:39:24.888
Missed it by that much.

1241
01:39:44.214 --> 01:39:46.114
"Operation Joy"?

1242
01:39:47.618 --> 01:39:51.452
The "Ode to Joy" will end with a bang.

1243
01:39:56.526 --> 01:39:59.689
- Chief!
- Yeah, Maxie! Are you okay?

1244
01:39:59.863 --> 01:40:03.924
Listen, I think the final notes
of the "Ode to Joy" trigger the bomb!

1245
01:40:04.101 --> 01:40:05.898
We have to stop the concert!

1246
01:40:06.069 --> 01:40:07.366
I'm on it.

1247
01:40:43.874 --> 01:40:47.435
My buttocks are really stinging
from being dragged.

1248
01:40:56.687 --> 01:40:59.121
Hey, grandpa, I already told you...

1249
01:40:59.856 --> 01:41:03.053
Speak up, son.
I'm an old man, you know.

1250
01:41:14.304 --> 01:41:16.568
I like that tackling part.

1251
01:41:20.877 --> 01:41:23.641
I am so, so sorry about that.

1252
01:41:23.814 --> 01:41:25.611
Wait! No, no, let him go.

1253
01:41:26.583 --> 01:41:28.676
- There is a bomb.
- Where?

1254
01:41:28.852 --> 01:41:31.844
Would you believe in the piano?

1255
01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:39.526
Whoa. How did we miss that?
That is huge.

1256
01:41:39.996 --> 01:41:44.490
- Max. Was that...?
- A total guess, yes, it was.

1257
01:41:53.276 --> 01:41:55.767
That old son of a gun
can take a hit, huh?

1258
01:42:03.120 --> 01:42:07.523
- Do you think I should tell him?
- No. Let's just savor the moment.

1259
01:42:16.199 --> 01:42:18.531
He's a funny son of a bitch, isn't he?

1260
01:42:19.236 --> 01:42:21.704
This is the proudest moment of my life!

1261
01:42:24.641 --> 01:42:26.199
Bomb not go off.

1262
01:42:26.376 --> 01:42:28.936
Oh, really, bright-eyes?
What alerted you?

1263
01:42:29.112 --> 01:42:32.240
Was it no "Boom, boom," or the lack
of a mushroom cloud?

1264
01:42:32.416 --> 01:42:35.112
It was the mushroom cloud for me.

1265
01:42:36.086 --> 01:42:40.955
Well, you did your job,
so I suppose I can't kill your wife.

1266
01:42:41.358 --> 01:42:44.953
Although to be honest,
I'd be doing the sighted world a favor.

1267
01:42:53.403 --> 01:42:55.701
What good hang time, huh?

1268
01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:59.671
Yes, Mr. President.
Thank you and goodbye, sir.

1269
01:42:59.876 --> 01:43:03.403
86, the President wanted me
to convey his personal thanks...

1270
01:43:03.580 --> 01:43:07.311
...and to tell you how impressed he was
with that dragged-by-a-train thing.

1271
01:43:07.484 --> 01:43:11.580
Well, sir, as an agent, I have trained
myself to be impervious to pain.

1272
01:43:12.989 --> 01:43:15.219
Ah! Hey, it's Fang.

1273
01:43:15.392 --> 01:43:18.054
I wanted him to be a surprise.

1274
01:43:18.228 --> 01:43:21.356
99, please, nobody here
knows that we're dating.

1275
01:43:21.531 --> 01:43:23.089
Yes, they do.

1276
01:43:24.367 --> 01:43:25.664
On the cheek.

1277
01:43:26.770 --> 01:43:28.499
- Let's go.
- Maybe a little one?

1278
01:43:29.473 --> 01:43:33.375
Hey, new guy. Hold up a second.
Welcome to CONTROL.

1279
01:43:33.543 --> 01:43:36.774
We have a tradition called "pick on
the new guy." Here's how it works.

1280
01:43:36.947 --> 01:43:39.939
- We pick on the new guy.
- And you can't do anything about it.

1281
01:43:40.116 --> 01:43:41.481
Let's try one.

1282
01:43:42.319 --> 01:43:45.311
- You dropped your pencil.
- Did you hear the man?

1283
01:43:45.722 --> 01:43:48.987
I don't see a man, I see two little girls.

1284
01:43:49.159 --> 01:43:53.186
I think I'll call you Maureen,
and you Brittany.

1285
01:43:53.363 --> 01:43:56.696
- New guy did not.
- New guy did.

1286
01:43:56.867 --> 01:43:58.858
- Okay, new guy...
- I got this.

1287
01:43:59.336 --> 01:44:00.826
And I'm going to enjoy it.

1288
01:44:01.004 --> 01:44:02.995
That will make me happy, Maureen.

1289
01:44:03.406 --> 01:44:04.430
Maureen.

1290
01:44:05.909 --> 01:44:07.171
Ow! What's in there?

1291
01:44:07.744 --> 01:44:09.575
- And just for the record.
- What's in there?

1292
01:44:11.147 --> 01:44:12.637
My name is not "new guy."

1293
01:44:13.884 --> 01:44:15.249
My name is Hymie.

1294
01:44:15.418 --> 01:44:17.818
Now, if you ladies will excuse me.

1295
01:44:20.223 --> 01:44:21.986
This is gonna be so fun.

1296
01:44:22.158 --> 01:44:23.750
Make him high-five me.

1297
01:44:58.128 --> 01:44:59.356
Max, we're gonna be late.

1298
01:45:03.366 --> 01:45:06.028
Oh, Max. Let Maintenance
take care of it.

1299
01:45:10.173 --> 01:45:11.265
Ah!

1300
01:45:11.441 --> 01:45:13.375
<i>You've gotta be kidding me!</i>
