01:00:32.861 --> 01:00:34.761


01:00:40.569 --> 01:00:43.629
Jesus, Dale. It's a murder,

01:00:43.805 --> 01:00:46.239
I know. You don't have to

01:00:46.408 --> 01:00:49.400
There was a great deal on nuts.

01:00:49.578 --> 01:00:50.772


01:00:50.946 --> 01:00:55.178
I'm doing Pellit, you're gonna do Harken,

01:00:55.417 --> 01:00:57.908
- Copy that.

01:01:28.316 --> 01:01:29.749


01:01:34.322 --> 01:01:36.187
Thank you, Kimmy.

01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:37.949


01:01:38.126 --> 01:01:40.424
See you next time.

01:01:40.595 --> 01:01:43.962
- Thank you, Bill.

01:01:51.773 --> 01:01:53.365


01:01:54.009 --> 01:01:55.306


01:01:56.211 --> 01:01:57.235


01:02:04.586 --> 01:02:05.917


01:02:07.656 --> 01:02:09.556
- Hey.

01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:13.053
- What do you know about Julia?

01:02:13.228 --> 01:02:15.219
...because this woman

01:02:15.397 --> 01:02:18.594
- How's it going over there?

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:23.394
Just... I'm waiting for, you know,

01:02:23.571 --> 01:02:26.039


01:02:26.207 --> 01:02:28.937
Wonder what, uh,

01:02:29.110 --> 01:02:30.839


01:02:31.012 --> 01:02:34.846
And we'll have to work at this every day,

01:02:35.016 --> 01:02:38.349
I want all of you forever, you and me,

01:02:56.171 --> 01:02:58.435


01:02:59.841 --> 01:03:03.106


01:03:05.213 --> 01:03:06.805


01:03:06.982 --> 01:03:08.711


01:03:27.202 --> 01:03:31.161
Jesus. Where does this guy

01:03:34.409 --> 01:03:36.001


01:03:54.329 --> 01:03:56.388


01:04:02.837 --> 01:04:05.670


01:04:10.745 --> 01:04:14.044


01:04:19.154 --> 01:04:22.055
- Yeah, Dale?

01:04:22.757 --> 01:04:25.521
Look, I know

01:04:26.428 --> 01:04:28.259
...I don't think

01:04:28.430 --> 01:04:29.454


01:04:29.631 --> 01:04:32.691
I know. I've been thinking

01:04:32.867 --> 01:04:35.427
- Yeah, let's just call it off.

01:04:35.603 --> 01:04:37.730
- What?

01:04:37.906 --> 01:04:38.964


01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.631
I don't know. He's walking

01:04:42.077 --> 01:04:44.841
- You think he's onto us?

01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:47.214


01:04:47.382 --> 01:04:48.406


01:04:51.119 --> 01:04:54.111
Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ,

01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:55.654


01:04:55.824 --> 01:04:59.191
Holy shit. Pellit opened up the door,

01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.521
...he fell down, he shot him again

01:05:01.696 --> 01:05:05.257
He shot him? Wait, what's going on?

01:05:05.433 --> 01:05:07.458
Nick? Say something.

01:05:07.635 --> 01:05:10.832
Nick! Nick, Nick, talk to me.

01:05:11.005 --> 01:05:12.097


01:05:12.273 --> 01:05:14.741
- How's Pellit doing?

01:05:22.016 --> 01:05:25.952
I gotta get out of here before somebody

01:05:26.121 --> 01:05:27.520


01:05:27.689 --> 01:05:31.591
I might throw up a couple times in the toilet

01:05:33.995 --> 01:05:35.053


01:05:35.230 --> 01:05:36.527


01:05:47.575 --> 01:05:49.270


01:05:49.444 --> 01:05:51.435
"Calm"?

01:05:51.613 --> 01:05:55.105
- I know. A guy you were gonna kill anyway.

01:05:55.316 --> 01:05:56.977
- What?

01:05:57.152 --> 01:05:59.211
I freaked out and panicked,

01:05:59.387 --> 01:06:01.821
Are you kidding?

01:06:01.990 --> 01:06:03.014


01:06:03.191 --> 01:06:06.183
You think when it came down to it,

01:06:06.361 --> 01:06:10.195
I don't know. Maybe you're right.

01:06:10.365 --> 01:06:13.459
- "Now"?

01:06:13.635 --> 01:06:15.227
- Did you sleep with her?

01:06:15.403 --> 01:06:17.803
Tell me you didn't sleep with her.

01:06:17.972 --> 01:06:20.236
But this time it wasn't my fault,

01:06:20.408 --> 01:06:22.774
You will be a suspect

01:06:22.944 --> 01:06:25.970
At first I was surveilling her,

01:06:26.147 --> 01:06:30.311
- She's incredibly hot, by the way. So hot.

01:06:30.485 --> 01:06:32.680
Next thing,

01:06:32.854 --> 01:06:33.878


01:06:34.055 --> 01:06:35.989


01:06:36.157 --> 01:06:38.557
- Like she knew I was watching.

01:06:38.726 --> 01:06:40.887
Slowly, seductively,

01:06:41.062 --> 01:06:42.927


01:06:43.097 --> 01:06:45.998
- Next she makes herself a little snack.

01:06:46.167 --> 01:06:47.191


01:06:47.368 --> 01:06:48.926
- Then a banana.

01:06:49.103 --> 01:06:52.630
- And finally, a hot dog. I mean, come on.

01:06:52.807 --> 01:06:55.674
Three penis-shaped foods,

01:06:55.843 --> 01:06:58.437
Eating them in that weird order?

01:06:58.613 --> 01:06:59.671


01:06:59.847 --> 01:07:02.748
Fine. So you took the penis foods

01:07:02.917 --> 01:07:06.717
No, no. God, no. I took her invitation

01:07:06.921 --> 01:07:09.185
She lured me in. It was

01:07:09.357 --> 01:07:11.848
Something clinically wrong with you.

01:07:12.026 --> 01:07:14.859
Come on. That's not nice, okay?

01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:16.519


01:07:16.698 --> 01:07:19.326
Can we move on?

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:23.163
All right, okay. Let me think. Okay,

01:07:23.338 --> 01:07:25.738
We call the cops

01:07:25.907 --> 01:07:27.932


01:07:28.109 --> 01:07:31.545
Harken's in jail, Pellit's in hell,

01:07:31.713 --> 01:07:33.908
...and all three of us

01:07:34.082 --> 01:07:36.312
It could work. An anonymous tip,

01:07:36.484 --> 01:07:37.508


01:07:37.685 --> 01:07:40.620
Gotta be from a pay phone, though,

01:07:40.788 --> 01:07:43.814
- Exactly.

01:07:44.859 --> 01:07:47.521
All right. Where do you even

01:07:47.695 --> 01:07:49.663


01:07:49.831 --> 01:07:52.629
Oh, yeah, I guess that's a good point.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.233


01:07:54.636 --> 01:07:57.400
- What is this?

01:07:57.572 --> 01:07:59.699
What?

01:08:07.482 --> 01:08:09.245


01:08:10.685 --> 01:08:12.277


01:08:13.988 --> 01:08:17.685
- Are you the owner of this vehicle?

01:08:17.892 --> 01:08:23.262
We got an APB on a gray Toyota Prius,

01:08:23.431 --> 01:08:24.659
- How come?

01:08:24.832 --> 01:08:26.800
- Did I talk to you?

01:08:27.235 --> 01:08:29.931


01:08:30.104 --> 01:08:33.164
A traffic cam caught this car

01:08:33.341 --> 01:08:36.799
- Would you know anything about that?

01:08:37.245 --> 01:08:40.214


01:08:40.381 --> 01:08:42.406
- Have you been drinking?

01:08:42.750 --> 01:08:43.978


01:08:44.152 --> 01:08:46.347
- This guy and the mouth in the back.

01:08:47.622 --> 01:08:49.783
I'm gonna need you

01:08:49.957 --> 01:08:51.151


01:08:51.526 --> 01:08:52.652


01:08:54.729 --> 01:08:58.790
I cannot believe I let you talk me into

01:08:58.966 --> 01:09:01.093
Are you kidding me?

01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:03.601
- Being hypothetical?

01:09:07.942 --> 01:09:11.969
Do you wanna explain

01:09:12.146 --> 01:09:14.341


01:09:14.515 --> 01:09:16.676


01:09:18.286 --> 01:09:19.514


01:09:20.688 --> 01:09:23.623
- I'm a drag racer.

01:09:23.791 --> 01:09:24.849


01:09:25.560 --> 01:09:27.084


01:09:30.498 --> 01:09:31.590


01:09:31.766 --> 01:09:34.098


01:09:34.268 --> 01:09:36.463


01:09:36.637 --> 01:09:40.937
Hour later we find the car. You happened to

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:43.907
- A registered sex offender.

01:09:44.078 --> 01:09:48.208
And this guy. Who happens to be working

01:09:48.683 --> 01:09:50.082


01:09:51.452 --> 01:09:52.680


01:09:53.554 --> 01:09:58.924
Oh, wow. What were you doing at his

01:09:59.961 --> 01:10:02.452


01:10:03.097 --> 01:10:06.999
I was making love.

01:10:07.168 --> 01:10:09.295


01:10:10.638 --> 01:10:13.198
- Detectives...

01:10:13.374 --> 01:10:16.036
If one of us knew, you know,

01:10:16.210 --> 01:10:20.544
...and he was willing to

01:10:21.215 --> 01:10:24.673
...he would be entitled

01:10:24.852 --> 01:10:27.685
No. He would be entitled

01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:30.680
If he knew who the shooter was

01:10:30.858 --> 01:10:32.723


01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.791
Glad none of us

01:10:34.962 --> 01:10:40.059
Listen, if you think we're gonna believe

01:10:40.234 --> 01:10:42.395


01:10:44.238 --> 01:10:49.266
Okay, wait. By saying

01:10:49.911 --> 01:10:52.709
...you're implying that

01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:56.475
...which would only be the case if we

01:10:56.784 --> 01:10:59.651
No. We just brought you in

01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:03.351


01:11:03.524 --> 01:11:06.857


01:11:07.028 --> 01:11:09.826
...constituting probable cause

01:11:09.997 --> 01:11:11.021


01:11:11.199 --> 01:11:15.693
Well, uh, then, pursuant to

01:11:16.671 --> 01:11:20.129
...I believe we are free to go.

01:11:20.775 --> 01:11:22.208


01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:25.212


01:11:25.379 --> 01:11:28.212


01:11:28.683 --> 01:11:30.173


01:11:30.351 --> 01:11:32.444
We gotta get back to your car.

01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:35.088
We get a cab? Take the train?

01:11:35.256 --> 01:11:38.919
- You ever been on a subway in this town?

01:11:39.093 --> 01:11:41.857
Law & Order, okay? You can

01:11:42.029 --> 01:11:43.860
- We showed them, huh?

01:11:44.031 --> 01:11:45.555


01:11:45.733 --> 01:11:49.863
There was a few conversations about ratting

01:11:50.037 --> 01:11:51.299


01:11:51.472 --> 01:11:54.270
That's for you, hotshot.

01:11:55.142 --> 01:11:57.269
You boys don't get

01:11:57.445 --> 01:12:02.542
Our forensics team is sweeping the Pellit

01:12:02.917 --> 01:12:05.750
And I'll tell you something.

01:12:10.424 --> 01:12:12.483


01:12:14.228 --> 01:12:16.594
Why would you put his whole bathroom

01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:20.757
- I didn't I know I had DNA in my butt.

01:12:20.935 --> 01:12:23.403
You just like shoving shit in your ass,

01:12:23.571 --> 01:12:25.368


01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:29.499
I don't have money for a lawyer. I bought

01:12:29.677 --> 01:12:32.612
...then I gave the rest of my motherfucking

01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:34.372


01:12:34.549 --> 01:12:38.542
- He's covered us this far, right? Five grand?

01:12:38.753 --> 01:12:41.017
- Shut up about that!

01:12:43.824 --> 01:12:46.224


01:12:46.394 --> 01:12:49.886
- Hello, Motherfucker.

01:12:50.064 --> 01:12:52.897
Whatever happened to

01:12:53.067 --> 01:12:54.728


01:12:54.902 --> 01:12:57.735
One of our intended victims

01:12:57.905 --> 01:12:59.497
- Shut the fuck up.

01:12:59.674 --> 01:13:01.539


01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:05.167
Thank you, but we had nothing to do

01:13:05.346 --> 01:13:06.870


01:13:07.048 --> 01:13:10.745
Kurt's DNA's all over the apartment because

01:13:10.918 --> 01:13:13.443
That's not the point.

01:13:13.621 --> 01:13:15.748
I got you. First thing first,

01:13:15.923 --> 01:13:17.481


01:13:17.992 --> 01:13:20.722
- I need $5000.

01:13:20.895 --> 01:13:22.487
- Two thousand?

01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:25.757


01:13:26.667 --> 01:13:28.601


01:13:28.769 --> 01:13:30.293
- Pay for his drink.

01:13:30.471 --> 01:13:31.961


01:13:32.139 --> 01:13:35.233
The guy that killed the other guy,

01:13:35.409 --> 01:13:37.240


01:13:37.411 --> 01:13:39.345


01:13:39.614 --> 01:13:44.017
Get him to confess to the murder

01:13:44.185 --> 01:13:45.846


01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:49.183
That how they got you

01:13:53.394 --> 01:13:55.453
- I ain't never murder nobody.

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:57.561


01:13:57.732 --> 01:14:00.701
Wait, no. You said you did a dime

01:14:00.868 --> 01:14:04.099
It was some nasty shit,

01:14:04.271 --> 01:14:07.001
- You implied it.

01:14:08.342 --> 01:14:10.435


01:14:13.247 --> 01:14:15.841
You guys ever see the movie

01:14:16.017 --> 01:14:17.041


01:14:17.218 --> 01:14:18.879
- Never seen that.

01:14:19.053 --> 01:14:22.819
What happened was is that I took a video

01:14:22.990 --> 01:14:25.458
They was waiting right outside the exit.

01:14:25.626 --> 01:14:27.651
- You did 10 years for video piracy?

01:14:27.828 --> 01:14:30.524
- They take that shit so serious, man.

01:14:30.698 --> 01:14:32.290


01:14:32.466 --> 01:14:35.629
...from some guy whose biggest crime

01:14:35.803 --> 01:14:38.237
- So you do know the movie.

01:14:38.406 --> 01:14:42.308
Everyone knows the movie. That's not

01:14:42.476 --> 01:14:47.072
Hang on a second, something doesn't

01:14:47.248 --> 01:14:51.514
So you just call yourself a video pirate,

01:14:51.686 --> 01:14:54.177
Why do you carry a gun on you,

01:14:54.355 --> 01:14:55.845
- A gun?

01:14:56.023 --> 01:14:58.150
- I don't wanna see it.

01:14:59.226 --> 01:15:02.320
- It's a Sidekick. I'm gonna be in the car.

01:15:02.496 --> 01:15:06.592
You grab at it like a gun and you confuse

01:15:06.767 --> 01:15:08.428
- Let's go.

01:15:08.836 --> 01:15:13.432
Look, you don't go into a bar and

01:15:13.607 --> 01:15:15.802
It was never a black-white thing.

01:15:15.976 --> 01:15:17.944


01:15:18.112 --> 01:15:20.103


01:15:30.491 --> 01:15:32.220


01:15:32.393 --> 01:15:33.553


01:15:33.728 --> 01:15:38.028
Yeah, it does. Okay, tape recorder's ready

01:15:38.199 --> 01:15:42.135
It was a pretty big investment so I should

01:15:42.303 --> 01:15:44.498
- No way. No, I'll do it.

01:15:44.672 --> 01:15:46.697
You'll have to duct-tape that

01:15:46.874 --> 01:15:49.274
I can't tape this to my chest.

01:15:49.443 --> 01:15:52.310
Just put it in your pocket.

01:15:52.947 --> 01:15:57.145
So, what do we do? Wait for him to come

01:15:57.318 --> 01:16:00.810
One of us gets in the chair, spins around

01:16:00.988 --> 01:16:02.819
- I'm in the chair.

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:04.855
- Why are you in the chair?

01:16:05.025 --> 01:16:08.483
Maybe we should get three chairs

01:16:08.662 --> 01:16:09.754


01:16:09.930 --> 01:16:12.398
That's not intimidating,

01:16:14.135 --> 01:16:15.261


01:16:15.436 --> 01:16:16.630


01:16:18.973 --> 01:16:21.567
Okay. It's a false alarm.

01:16:21.742 --> 01:16:22.970


01:16:23.144 --> 01:16:24.975


01:16:25.146 --> 01:16:27.011


01:16:27.181 --> 01:16:30.480
You're the young man who helped Dave

01:16:30.651 --> 01:16:32.949
- That's him.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:37.079
- How is he?

01:16:37.658 --> 01:16:39.853
- Did I invite you?

01:16:40.027 --> 01:16:41.858


01:16:42.029 --> 01:16:44.122
- These are my plus-twos.

01:16:44.298 --> 01:16:46.323
Oh, we should hide.

01:16:47.368 --> 01:16:51.304
Someone get the lights.

01:16:52.173 --> 01:16:55.973
I'm Kurt, by the way. I didn't

01:16:56.143 --> 01:16:59.271
- Oh, hey, Rhonda. Hi. Hi.

01:16:59.480 --> 01:17:02.005
Nick didn't tell me

01:17:02.183 --> 01:17:04.310


01:17:05.686 --> 01:17:07.381


01:17:11.926 --> 01:17:13.917


01:17:14.094 --> 01:17:16.392


01:17:16.564 --> 01:17:17.758


01:17:18.632 --> 01:17:20.930
- So you were surprised?

01:17:21.101 --> 01:17:22.363


01:17:23.838 --> 01:17:25.305


01:17:25.472 --> 01:17:28.202


01:17:28.542 --> 01:17:32.103
I think we got him. Ha, ha.

01:17:33.314 --> 01:17:34.906


01:17:35.082 --> 01:17:37.482
He's gone off on his own.

01:17:37.651 --> 01:17:39.380
- You guys ready?

01:17:39.553 --> 01:17:41.350
Stay close, okay?

01:17:41.722 --> 01:17:44.156


01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:47.327


01:17:48.529 --> 01:17:50.292


01:17:50.564 --> 01:17:53.362
What are you doing here?

01:17:53.534 --> 01:17:56.059
- We know what you did.

01:17:56.237 --> 01:17:58.330


01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.639


01:18:01.475 --> 01:18:03.943
So, what is this, then?

01:18:05.045 --> 01:18:07.843


01:18:08.449 --> 01:18:11.714
...because you saw me

01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.080


01:18:16.023 --> 01:18:17.490


01:18:18.192 --> 01:18:20.387


01:18:20.561 --> 01:18:23.792
Pellit? Trust me, Pellit's name

01:18:23.964 --> 01:18:26.398


01:18:26.567 --> 01:18:29.035
Yeah, that's right.

01:18:29.203 --> 01:18:30.795


01:18:30.971 --> 01:18:32.802
Hold that thought,

01:18:32.973 --> 01:18:37.535
I walked right up to his door, I put

01:18:37.711 --> 01:18:40.942
Then you know what? You know

01:18:41.115 --> 01:18:43.083


01:18:43.717 --> 01:18:45.582


01:18:46.453 --> 01:18:50.321
So if you think

01:18:50.491 --> 01:18:55.053
...who won't do exactly the same thing

01:18:55.229 --> 01:18:56.355


01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:59.624
Know who thinks you're a pussy?

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.233


01:19:02.536 --> 01:19:08.600
You walk into my house on

01:19:10.244 --> 01:19:11.802


01:19:13.247 --> 01:19:15.078


01:19:15.716 --> 01:19:18.207


01:19:18.385 --> 01:19:19.716
- And...?

01:19:19.887 --> 01:19:22.515


01:19:23.257 --> 01:19:25.851
I didn't know it was your birthday.

01:19:26.026 --> 01:19:28.654
- What do you got?

01:19:28.829 --> 01:19:30.126
- I'll get the car.

01:19:30.297 --> 01:19:34.324
We had him, we had the whole goddamn

01:19:34.601 --> 01:19:35.761
Hey!

01:19:35.936 --> 01:19:36.960


01:19:37.137 --> 01:19:39.537
My, uh, stomach was bothering me.

01:19:39.707 --> 01:19:41.971
He confessed everything,

01:19:42.142 --> 01:19:43.609
Kurt, what happened there?

01:19:43.777 --> 01:19:45.768
...she was giving me a tour

01:19:46.213 --> 01:19:49.046
- Ow! What are you...?

01:19:49.216 --> 01:19:51.309
Knock it off.

01:19:55.089 --> 01:19:57.717


01:19:58.258 --> 01:20:01.489
She's just very hot. And I'm weak.

01:20:01.662 --> 01:20:02.788


01:20:04.164 --> 01:20:06.132
- Back it up, back it up.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.790
- They found my DNA.

01:20:07.968 --> 01:20:12.371
Go backwards. Go backwards.

01:20:12.973 --> 01:20:16.374
- You are obsessed with your asshole!

01:20:16.543 --> 01:20:19.444
Shut it down. Let's start talking about

01:20:19.613 --> 01:20:22.548
- The current situation won't work.

01:20:22.716 --> 01:20:24.013


01:20:24.184 --> 01:20:26.744
Damn right.

01:20:27.087 --> 01:20:29.783
I can't live in Mexico.

01:20:29.957 --> 01:20:31.857


01:20:32.026 --> 01:20:34.586
- You'd rather be in jail the rest of your life?

01:20:35.963 --> 01:20:38.124
I'm getting a call. I gotta get this.

01:20:38.599 --> 01:20:39.759


01:20:39.933 --> 01:20:42.663
Uh, look, Julia,

01:20:42.836 --> 01:20:44.895
- Hey, I'm not here.

01:20:45.072 --> 01:20:47.302
I actually meant to

01:20:47.474 --> 01:20:49.271


01:20:49.443 --> 01:20:52.606
- No, don't do that. Wait. Wait.

01:20:52.780 --> 01:20:55.908
We gotta buy coats and sweaters

01:20:56.083 --> 01:20:58.347


01:20:58.519 --> 01:21:00.851
I'm sort of tired of you

01:21:01.021 --> 01:21:02.420


01:21:02.589 --> 01:21:06.218
I'm not toying with you. I'm gonna

01:21:06.393 --> 01:21:09.260
Wait, wait, wait.

01:21:09.596 --> 01:21:11.257
- I'm gonna have sex with you.

01:21:11.432 --> 01:21:13.559


01:21:13.734 --> 01:21:15.395


01:21:15.569 --> 01:21:18.834
Details? I'm in a car with people.

01:21:19.073 --> 01:21:22.406
- I don't care if it's not a great time.

01:21:22.576 --> 01:21:24.601
I'm gonna make you feel good.

01:21:24.778 --> 01:21:27.246
With my fingers and my tongue

01:21:27.414 --> 01:21:29.314


01:21:29.483 --> 01:21:32.111
All right, I'm gonna put my penis

01:21:32.286 --> 01:21:34.584


01:21:36.490 --> 01:21:37.889


01:21:40.394 --> 01:21:42.919
- What the fuck?

01:21:44.164 --> 01:21:46.155
- Oh, my God!

01:21:48.402 --> 01:21:50.097


01:21:52.606 --> 01:21:55.939
Hey, are you gonna slap me in the face

01:21:56.110 --> 01:21:58.408
Yes, I'll slap you in the face

01:21:58.579 --> 01:22:01.844
- This guy's fucking crazy.

01:22:02.316 --> 01:22:04.341
- Don't get in a wreck.

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:08.147


01:22:08.322 --> 01:22:09.846


01:22:10.023 --> 01:22:12.924
...and I'll rub my naked butt

01:22:13.093 --> 01:22:14.685


01:22:14.862 --> 01:22:16.887
...and we're both really chafed up

01:22:23.470 --> 01:22:26.337
Not good. Get us out of here!

01:22:26.507 --> 01:22:27.531


01:22:29.510 --> 01:22:31.603
- Come on.

01:22:31.778 --> 01:22:33.507
- What else?

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:35.580
...jam my skull

01:22:37.851 --> 01:22:39.876


01:22:40.053 --> 01:22:43.386
And I'll dance on your boobies,

01:22:45.959 --> 01:22:49.122


01:22:49.296 --> 01:22:50.627


01:22:50.797 --> 01:22:52.788
Nice job fucking the crazy

01:22:52.966 --> 01:22:55.298
Maybe I should have been

01:22:55.469 --> 01:22:56.527


01:22:56.703 --> 01:22:58.432


01:22:58.605 --> 01:22:59.663


01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:02.775
Good evening, Mr. Buckman.

01:23:02.943 --> 01:23:05.377
Our onboard sensors

01:23:05.546 --> 01:23:07.673
That's because

01:23:07.848 --> 01:23:10.715
I will alert the authorities

01:23:10.884 --> 01:23:12.977
Don't call the cops.

01:23:13.153 --> 01:23:17.146
No, Gregory, they think we murdered

01:23:19.059 --> 01:23:20.754
What's going on?

01:23:20.928 --> 01:23:23.897
Whoa. Oh, no, no, no. I didn't do that.

01:23:24.064 --> 01:23:26.430
I remotely disabled your engine.

01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:28.329


01:23:28.502 --> 01:23:30.402
...whenever a driver

01:23:30.571 --> 01:23:33.165
I pay 19 bucks a month

01:23:33.373 --> 01:23:36.274
Remain with your vehicle.

01:23:36.443 --> 01:23:39.207
Gregory, I thought you were

01:23:54.661 --> 01:23:57.129
Get out of the car, all of you.

01:24:00.033 --> 01:24:03.093
- Remember I saved your life that one time?

01:24:05.439 --> 01:24:07.339
Just take it easy with that...

01:24:07.507 --> 01:24:09.168


01:24:09.343 --> 01:24:12.801
Which means I can shoot all of you

01:24:12.980 --> 01:24:14.971
...if I really wanted to,

01:24:15.148 --> 01:24:17.616
You're not gonna shoot us twice

01:24:17.784 --> 01:24:18.944


01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.854
I got a better idea. I'm gonna tell

01:24:24.024 --> 01:24:27.653
And when I found out,

01:24:27.828 --> 01:24:29.318
- That's crazy.

01:24:29.496 --> 01:24:33.330
Because I don't see one shred

01:24:33.500 --> 01:24:35.991
And besides, I'm the guy

01:24:36.169 --> 01:24:37.431


01:24:39.606 --> 01:24:41.437


01:24:41.608 --> 01:24:43.371


01:24:43.543 --> 01:24:44.942
- Catch!

01:24:45.112 --> 01:24:47.012
- Goddamn it, Dale.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.672
You can't win a marathon without

01:24:51.385 --> 01:24:53.945
- What does that mean?

01:24:59.793 --> 01:25:01.055
- Everybody freeze!

01:25:01.228 --> 01:25:03.423


01:25:03.597 --> 01:25:06.532
Thank God.

01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:08.668


01:25:08.835 --> 01:25:10.530
- That's not true!

01:25:10.704 --> 01:25:13.468
I found out they murdered someone.

01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:16.541
Please protect me from them.

01:25:16.710 --> 01:25:19.076
All right, take it easy.

01:25:19.413 --> 01:25:23.110
Hey, what is this?

01:25:23.283 --> 01:25:24.807


01:25:24.985 --> 01:25:28.045
- A tape recorder. Did you turn that off?

01:25:28.221 --> 01:25:30.587
- So listen to us, officer.

01:25:30.757 --> 01:25:33.783
Listen to us for one second.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.257


01:25:35.429 --> 01:25:38.660
...and he was gonna shoot us once

01:25:38.832 --> 01:25:41.062
- You are insane.

01:25:43.804 --> 01:25:46.329


01:25:46.506 --> 01:25:48.235


01:25:48.608 --> 01:25:50.132


01:25:50.310 --> 01:25:52.210
No, no. Of course not, no.

01:25:52.379 --> 01:25:55.041
...jam my skull

01:25:55.215 --> 01:25:57.649
I'll dance on your boobies,

01:25:57.818 --> 01:25:58.842


01:25:59.019 --> 01:26:02.352
Don't judge. I have a thing with my boss.

01:26:02.522 --> 01:26:04.012


01:26:07.761 --> 01:26:08.853


01:26:09.029 --> 01:26:10.428
- Shit!

01:26:10.597 --> 01:26:12.394
Thing must have stopped

01:26:12.566 --> 01:26:14.227
Before this guy

01:26:14.401 --> 01:26:16.926
I told you, these guys are liars.

01:26:17.104 --> 01:26:18.901


01:26:19.072 --> 01:26:21.563
- He shot himself.

01:26:23.777 --> 01:26:25.574
- Cuff them.

01:26:25.746 --> 01:26:28.510
- You don't need to cuff us.

01:26:28.682 --> 01:26:30.309


01:26:30.484 --> 01:26:31.883


01:26:32.052 --> 01:26:33.849


01:26:34.054 --> 01:26:36.181
I should mention

01:26:36.356 --> 01:26:39.189
...to record all conversations

01:26:39.359 --> 01:26:41.657
- Who the hell's that?

01:26:41.828 --> 01:26:43.386
- His name is Almonan.

01:26:43.563 --> 01:26:45.121
Atmanad.

01:26:45.298 --> 01:26:47.630
- Atmanad is what it was!

01:26:47.801 --> 01:26:50.599


01:26:50.771 --> 01:26:53.399
- Play it just after the crash.

01:26:53.573 --> 01:26:56.269
You're not gonna listen to this.

01:26:56.443 --> 01:26:58.502


01:26:58.678 --> 01:27:01.647
Which means I can shoot all of you

01:27:01.815 --> 01:27:04.249
...if I really wanted to,

01:27:04.418 --> 01:27:05.885
- That's it.

01:27:08.422 --> 01:27:11.823
That is not proof. That's just a car.

01:27:11.992 --> 01:27:14.552
Looks like I'm getting that promotion

01:27:14.961 --> 01:27:16.952
To answer your question,

01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:19.257
- You fucked my wife?

01:27:19.433 --> 01:27:20.457


01:27:23.570 --> 01:27:24.867


01:27:26.039 --> 01:27:27.472


01:27:27.641 --> 01:27:29.268


01:27:29.443 --> 01:27:31.638
- Good Will Hunting.

01:27:31.812 --> 01:27:33.439
- That's so great.

01:27:33.613 --> 01:27:36.741
Good Will Hunting rip. Instead of

01:27:36.917 --> 01:27:38.976
- Felt like a moment.

01:27:39.152 --> 01:27:41.552
So in the end,

01:27:41.721 --> 01:27:44.315
Actually, we did later that night

01:27:44.491 --> 01:27:46.516


01:27:46.693 --> 01:27:49.560
...they ultimately agreed

01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:51.356


01:27:51.832 --> 01:27:55.529
...there's no laws on the books against

01:27:55.702 --> 01:27:57.795
Anyway,

01:27:57.971 --> 01:28:03.238
...on all fours in prison for 25 to life,

01:28:03.944 --> 01:28:07.607
It's a great job, I got a solid raise

01:28:07.781 --> 01:28:09.078


01:28:09.249 --> 01:28:12.946
- Morning.

01:28:13.119 --> 01:28:15.883
- I am.

01:28:16.056 --> 01:28:19.025
- You too, Mr. Sherman.

01:28:19.726 --> 01:28:21.626


01:28:21.795 --> 01:28:24.889
I appreciate the opportunity

01:28:25.232 --> 01:28:26.722


01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:29.562
From what I hear, people say

01:28:30.937 --> 01:28:32.837
Mr. Sherman,

01:28:33.006 --> 01:28:34.030


01:28:34.207 --> 01:28:35.435


01:28:35.609 --> 01:28:38.578


01:28:38.745 --> 01:28:40.679


01:28:40.847 --> 01:28:43.213
- You hear that?

01:28:43.383 --> 01:28:45.476
Sounds like there's someone

01:28:45.685 --> 01:28:50.054
Why don't we let this

01:28:50.223 --> 01:28:51.622


01:28:51.791 --> 01:28:54.055


01:28:54.227 --> 01:28:56.422


01:28:57.731 --> 01:29:01.599
Meanwhile, the Pellit family put the most

01:29:01.768 --> 01:29:04.760
...which wasn't Kurt.

01:29:04.938 --> 01:29:08.840
Because he realized that when you're

01:29:09.009 --> 01:29:12.376
- Hey, Kurt. Come in.

01:29:12.546 --> 01:29:13.570


01:29:13.747 --> 01:29:17.513
If there's anything I can do to help out

01:29:17.684 --> 01:29:19.845
- What baby?

01:29:20.921 --> 01:29:23.913
- I'm not pregnant.

01:29:25.425 --> 01:29:26.551


01:29:26.927 --> 01:29:28.485


01:29:29.029 --> 01:29:33.466
I was thinking perhaps

01:29:33.633 --> 01:29:34.657


01:29:35.035 --> 01:29:38.596
Ultimately, he decided his only choice

01:29:38.772 --> 01:29:42.765


01:29:42.943 --> 01:29:45.104


01:29:45.545 --> 01:29:47.479


01:29:49.115 --> 01:29:50.707


01:29:50.884 --> 01:29:52.476
- You like that, Dale?

01:29:52.652 --> 01:29:54.483


01:29:55.689 --> 01:29:59.625
Oh, gosh, do I wish

01:30:02.495 --> 01:30:03.723


01:30:03.897 --> 01:30:06.661
I'm so sorry, but I couldn't keep it

01:30:06.833 --> 01:30:08.994
- She was talking to your penis!

01:30:09.169 --> 01:30:12.900
Julia, this is my good friend,

01:30:13.073 --> 01:30:14.734


01:30:14.908 --> 01:30:16.967
- Give me some of that.

01:30:17.143 --> 01:30:19.839
Now, Kenny here, he'll do

01:30:20.013 --> 01:30:22.072
- Yeah, it's true.

01:30:22.248 --> 01:30:24.978
But that's why I asked him

01:30:25.151 --> 01:30:29.281
Really? Is this all you've got?

01:30:29.456 --> 01:30:31.014


01:30:31.191 --> 01:30:34.752
Say hi to my cameraman.

01:30:34.928 --> 01:30:36.657


01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:38.627


01:30:38.798 --> 01:30:40.231


01:30:40.400 --> 01:30:43.369
Julia, shut the fuck up for a second,

01:30:43.536 --> 01:30:45.470


01:30:45.639 --> 01:30:50.906
I'm going to take a very nice, very expensive

01:30:51.077 --> 01:30:54.205
Let's call it a honeymoon, all right?

01:30:54.414 --> 01:30:59.442
Then I'm going to return

01:30:59.619 --> 01:31:04.556
Because if you so much as look

01:31:04.724 --> 01:31:07.454


01:31:07.627 --> 01:31:13.532


01:31:14.401 --> 01:31:16.995


01:31:24.911 --> 01:31:28.745
How's the hair? Is it good, is it great?

01:31:30.383 --> 01:31:35.787
I had no idea that you called

01:31:38.892 --> 01:31:40.450


01:31:41.895 --> 01:31:43.021


01:31:46.199 --> 01:31:49.396


01:31:49.736 --> 01:31:52.933
This place is awful. It's like

01:31:53.106 --> 01:31:54.300


01:31:54.474 --> 01:31:57.068


01:31:57.243 --> 01:32:01.043


01:32:02.415 --> 01:32:04.280


01:32:11.758 --> 01:32:12.782


01:32:12.959 --> 01:32:14.893
- You're good? He's good.

01:32:15.261 --> 01:32:17.786
Or else little Stacy here's

01:32:17.964 --> 01:32:21.365


01:32:24.137 --> 01:32:26.731


01:32:28.608 --> 01:32:31.304
Have you ever in your life

01:32:34.047 --> 01:32:36.811


01:32:38.284 --> 01:32:39.478


01:32:44.023 --> 01:32:46.583
Now I'm sneezing dust bunnies.

01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:48.751


01:32:48.928 --> 01:32:50.657
Is that my brain?

01:32:50.830 --> 01:32:52.263


01:32:52.432 --> 01:32:54.263
I want a lollipop.

01:32:54.434 --> 01:32:57.198
Do you have MDMA?

01:33:02.509 --> 01:33:04.340


01:33:06.012 --> 01:33:10.881
What is your projected outside date

01:33:19.692 --> 01:33:21.421


01:33:23.997 --> 01:33:26.295
- Oh, hi! Hi! Hello.

01:33:26.466 --> 01:33:27.694


01:33:29.502 --> 01:33:32.733
Wouldn't mind bending her over a barrel

01:33:32.906 --> 01:33:34.305


01:33:34.474 --> 01:33:36.442
- It's a phrase.

01:33:36.609 --> 01:33:40.443
Yeah, it is. It certainly is.

01:33:40.613 --> 01:33:42.877
- Really?

01:33:43.049 --> 01:33:44.073


01:33:44.250 --> 01:33:45.911


01:33:46.219 --> 01:33:47.914
Beautiful.
