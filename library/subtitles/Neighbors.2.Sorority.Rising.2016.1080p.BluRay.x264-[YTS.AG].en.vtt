00:00:41.792 --> 00:00:44.716
Okay. Oh, you <i>know</i> it.

2
00:00:44.878 --> 00:00:46.238
- Okay.
- Okay.

3
00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:47.690
- There we go.
<i>- That's</i> it.

4
00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.307
<i>- That's good.
- Okay.</i>

5
00:00:49.383 --> 00:00:51.806
<i>- Okay.
- I'm okay.</i>

6
00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:53.269
- Ah!
- Shh.

7
00:00:53.428 --> 00:00:55.031
Do you want me to put a
pillow over your mouth?

8
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:56.682
You gonna choke me or something?
What?

9
00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:57.974
Is it like a new sexy thing?

10
00:00:58.141 --> 00:00:59.643
No, so Stella won't wake up.

11
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.454
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
I'll just be quiet. - RIPPED BY ELAJOHN

12
00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:02.821
Okay.

13
00:01:07.901 --> 00:01:08.902
Shh.

14
00:01:08.986 --> 00:01:10.408
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.118
I'm having a hard time.

16
00:01:12.322 --> 00:01:13.414
I'm a vocal lover.

17
00:01:16.702 --> 00:01:17.703
Oh.

18
00:01:18.078 --> 00:01:19.705
What was that?
Nothing.

19
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:21.474
Just looked like you might throw up.
I'm fine.

20
00:01:21.498 --> 00:01:23.045
You're sure?
No, I'm fine.

21
00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:25.336
Is it me? Are you
nauseated by me?

22
00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:26.420
Come on.

23
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.172
Baby, you're my bear.

24
00:01:28.338 --> 00:01:30.011
You look awfully nauseous.
I'm fine.

25
00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.455
Did you eat a crab salad again?

26
00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.183
You did, didn't you? No.

27
00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.185
Oh, no.

28
00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.685
Okay.

29
00:01:41.518 --> 00:01:42.895
That's fine.

30
00:01:43.562 --> 00:01:45.360
Stop. Just stop.
Sorry, it's...

31
00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:47.608
You're so sexy though.
Thanks, baby.

32
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.692
You're sure you're okay?

33
00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:51.032
Honey, I'm completely
and totally...

34
00:01:54.323 --> 00:01:55.449
Sorry.

35
00:01:55.574 --> 00:01:57.497
Baby, I think
I might be pregnant.

36
00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.036
That's great!

37
00:01:59.703 --> 00:02:01.922
Sweetie, that's fantastic!

38
00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.419
Ugh.

39
00:02:03.498 --> 00:02:04.778
Sorry.
Why don't we...

40
00:02:04.833 --> 00:02:06.631
Is it weird that I came?

41
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.859
They're gonna be
here in five minutes.

42
00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.383
I gotta poo!
You already pooed.

43
00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.652
I need to poo twice sometimes!
When I'm nervous I poo twice!

44
00:02:14.676 --> 00:02:15.862
You're gonna have to poo later!

45
00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:17.263
Fuck! Fine!

46
00:02:19.056 --> 00:02:20.199
Stella, how do you keep finding

47
00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.349
Mommy's dildo?

48
00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:23.860
Just put it away, okay?

49
00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.067
When did she start saying
"no" all the time?

50
00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:28.448
I don't know. Hide
your unmentionables.

51
00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:30.400
Hide your bongs!

52
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.754
What's that smell?
It's bong water.

53
00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:45.798
Hey! Welcome home.
Hi!

54
00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:47.425
Yeah, come in.

55
00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.928
If you decide to buy
the house, that is.

56
00:02:50.087 --> 00:02:51.760
They might.
They like it.

57
00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.050
Yes. Great.
Well, yeah, so...

58
00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:57.641
Sorry. I know it's annoying
to keep on dropping in.

59
00:02:57.803 --> 00:02:59.405
No. Not annoying at all.
Not annoying at all.

60
00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:00.772
What's annoying about this?

61
00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:02.015
So guys.

62
00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:04.935
Here's the thing.

63
00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.561
We'll take it!

64
00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:07.729
On...

65
00:03:07.813 --> 00:03:08.985
Oh, that was totally...

66
00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:10.278
All right.

67
00:03:10.774 --> 00:03:11.775
That was scary.

68
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:12.943
We love suspense.

69
00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.160
Oh, boy. Look.

70
00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:16.371
Guess your daughter
found your vibrator.

71
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.493
Stella.

72
00:03:17.572 --> 00:03:18.619
She just keeps finding it.

73
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:19.951
I don't know what's going on.

74
00:03:20.117 --> 00:03:22.119
Stels, put that away.
No.

75
00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:23.471
Stels! She just
learned that word.

76
00:03:23.495 --> 00:03:26.169
Don't even worry. I think I have
that same one at home, right?

77
00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.296
But ours is in black.

78
00:03:31.253 --> 00:03:32.630
Black cock.

79
00:03:34.005 --> 00:03:35.382
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Dude.

80
00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.263
Maybe we should sign some stuff.

81
00:03:37.426 --> 00:03:38.518
Why don't we.

82
00:03:38.635 --> 00:03:39.835
Yep. I think
we should do that.

83
00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:44.617
We sold our house!
We sold our house!

84
00:03:44.641 --> 00:03:45.938
We did it!
Whoo!

85
00:03:47.144 --> 00:03:49.272
Don't get too psyched because
you haven't sold it yet.

86
00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:50.446
You're in escrow.

87
00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:54.210
What's that bullshit? Were
you trying to fuck us over?

88
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:55.294
What the fuck are
you talking about?

89
00:03:55.318 --> 00:03:56.671
I asked you months
ago if you understood

90
00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:58.447
what escrow was,
and you said yes.

91
00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:00.341
Just say it one more time.
Maybe say it one more time.

92
00:04:00.365 --> 00:04:01.759
You know, just
refresh our memories.

93
00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:02.783
Okay. Very simple.

94
00:04:02.826 --> 00:04:05.830
Escrow is a 30-day period wherein
the buyer of the new house

95
00:04:05.912 --> 00:04:07.539
gets to do
inspections and whatnot.

96
00:04:07.622 --> 00:04:09.249
And assuming
everything goes well

97
00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.552
and nothing changes with the living
situation to spook them or something,

98
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:13.716
you close. Okay?

99
00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:15.342
So wait. Do we
have escrows on

100
00:04:15.422 --> 00:04:16.941
the other house we just
bought in the suburbs?

101
00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:18.433
No. You have no
escrow on that house.

102
00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:20.018
Why the fuck not?

103
00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:22.141
Because that house
had multiple offers.

104
00:04:22.304 --> 00:04:23.304
And you screamed at me,

105
00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.186
"Do whatever you have to
do to get that house."

106
00:04:25.223 --> 00:04:26.475
Yeah, I remember that.

107
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:28.281
So, I did it. So you
have no escrow there.

108
00:04:28.351 --> 00:04:30.103
And then I asked
you three times,

109
00:04:30.228 --> 00:04:32.026
"Do you understand
what escrow is?"

110
00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:33.691
And once again

111
00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:35.659
you just nodded.

112
00:04:35.776 --> 00:04:37.494
Just like you are right now.

113
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.829
This is how the real
estate crisis happened.

114
00:04:40.864 --> 00:04:43.617
Buyers can pop by
at any time, okay?

115
00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:45.244
- Okay.
- Okay.

116
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.163
So, your 30 days "do not
fuck up" clock starts now.

117
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:49.891
Could you just watch
your language, please?

118
00:04:49.915 --> 00:04:51.087
She's holding a dildo.

119
00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:53.251
That's not a dildo.
That is a...

120
00:04:54.503 --> 00:04:55.503
Toy.

121
00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:57.092
From a cartoon.

122
00:04:57.255 --> 00:04:59.678
Mmm-hmm. Japanese,
anime cartoon.

123
00:05:00.383 --> 00:05:02.602
Well, I watch that cartoon
every night.

124
00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:05.397
Ah, Jesus Christ,
man, we're getting old.

125
00:05:05.555 --> 00:05:06.556
Why do you say that?

126
00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:07.898
Because our friends are dying.

127
00:05:08.892 --> 00:05:10.144
Who's dying?

128
00:05:10.352 --> 00:05:12.104
Do you remember Joe Waterston?
Yeah.

129
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:13.981
Dead.
Really?

130
00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:16.112
Yeah. Had this little weird
mole on his shoulder.

131
00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.949
Was driving to get it checked
out, hit by a bus. Dead.

132
00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:21.529
Are you okay, man?

133
00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.414
No, I'm not okay, man.

134
00:05:23.615 --> 00:05:25.538
I'm freaking out about
Paula having a baby.

135
00:05:25.617 --> 00:05:26.834
I don't think I can do it.

136
00:05:26.952 --> 00:05:28.763
Dude, you're gonna be a good parent.
Don't worry.

137
00:05:28.787 --> 00:05:30.755
No, I'm not.
I don't know anything.

138
00:05:30.914 --> 00:05:32.514
Do you know you
can't leave a baby alone?

139
00:05:32.541 --> 00:05:33.541
If you're at home

140
00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:36.382
and you want the baby to stay while
you go see a movie? Unacceptable.

141
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:37.508
That I do know.

142
00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:38.773
You knew that?
I did know that.

143
00:05:38.797 --> 00:05:40.219
How the fuck are
you gonna have two?

144
00:05:40.298 --> 00:05:42.972
I don't even understand
how that physically works.

145
00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:44.237
I'm actually not that worried.

146
00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:45.763
I'm a good father
to one daughter.

147
00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:48.164
I think I'll be a good father
to two daughters.

148
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.352
Come on.
What?

149
00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.107
You're not a good father.

150
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:55.443
Fuck you. I'm
a good parent. Okay?

151
00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:56.652
Okay, okay, okay.
Yeah.

152
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.751
Well, tell yourself that,
because before you know it,

153
00:05:58.775 --> 00:06:00.869
Stella is gonna be
a tween who hates you,

154
00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:03.948
and it's gonna be your fault because
you let her play with Kelly's dildo.

155
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:05.703
Because you're a bad parent.

156
00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:07.204
Me and Kelly are good parents.

157
00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:08.724
Don't take your
shit out on me, okay?

158
00:06:08.785 --> 00:06:11.755
All I'm saying, thank
God, I'm having a boy.

159
00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.958
'Cause girls are fuckin' hard.

160
00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.592
What are you talking about?

161
00:06:15.667 --> 00:06:17.419
Man, it's just easier
with boys, you know?

162
00:06:17.502 --> 00:06:19.470
Like, when a boy
gets laid, it's awesome.

163
00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:21.677
When a girl gets laid, it's bad.

164
00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.012
That's not true.

165
00:06:23.174 --> 00:06:24.485
You want your
daughter to have sex?

166
00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:26.477
You're gonna be like,
"Hey, Jimmy, good news.

167
00:06:26.636 --> 00:06:27.808
"Stella just got fucked.

168
00:06:27.971 --> 00:06:29.411
"Come on over
let's have some beers."

169
00:06:53.663 --> 00:06:55.665
Yay!
Yay!

170
00:06:55.832 --> 00:06:57.880
Welcome to Phi Lambda!

171
00:06:58.043 --> 00:06:59.135
Yay!

172
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.803
This is such an exciting year.

173
00:07:00.962 --> 00:07:02.464
If you're lucky,
and you make the cut,

174
00:07:02.631 --> 00:07:04.133
you will be joining a sisterhood

175
00:07:04.215 --> 00:07:05.717
and making best
friends for life.

176
00:07:05.884 --> 00:07:07.181
Yay!

177
00:07:07.344 --> 00:07:09.424
We're getting a hot tub.

178
00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:10.688
Yay!

179
00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:13.350
We have all brand
new feather duvets.

180
00:07:14.184 --> 00:07:15.185
That's dope.

181
00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.688
And we got a new chef,
and we're going gluten-free.

182
00:07:20.774 --> 00:07:22.151
Hi. What are you doing?

183
00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:28.620
I totally should've offered it
to you first, man. I'm sorry.

184
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.333
Pecking order, you know?

185
00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:32.039
Who hits it first?
No, you go for it.

186
00:07:32.202 --> 00:07:33.795
No, we don't hit
joints here, ever.

187
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:35.848
That's against the rules. You're
gonna have to take that out.

188
00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:36.873
Cup!

189
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.542
Cup.

190
00:07:39.626 --> 00:07:42.425
This is $12. There's
hash oil in the middle.

191
00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:43.546
Cup!

192
00:07:46.424 --> 00:07:47.971
Your parties must
totally suck ass

193
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:49.553
if you can't smoke weed.
Am I right?

194
00:07:49.719 --> 00:07:50.720
Oh, damn!

195
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.198
We don't throw parties here.

196
00:07:52.222 --> 00:07:53.269
No sorority can.

197
00:07:53.348 --> 00:07:54.948
According to the
Greek Council, we can't.

198
00:07:55.016 --> 00:07:56.393
Really?

199
00:07:56.476 --> 00:07:57.819
No, this is an actual,
real thing.

200
00:07:57.936 --> 00:07:59.279
In the United States of America,

201
00:07:59.354 --> 00:08:02.153
sororities are not allowed to
throw parties in their houses.

202
00:08:02.232 --> 00:08:03.575
Only frats can.

203
00:08:03.733 --> 00:08:04.905
Google it.

204
00:08:08.196 --> 00:08:09.539
Oh, my God! Really?

205
00:08:09.739 --> 00:08:10.911
You just don't party?

206
00:08:11.074 --> 00:08:12.576
No, of course we party, stupid.

207
00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:14.002
We just do it at frats.

208
00:08:14.077 --> 00:08:15.078
Yes!

209
00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.168
Phi Lambda!

210
00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.762
Hey!
Oh, hi!

211
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.923
Sorry, if I interrupted.
No, I...

212
00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:28.401
I don't actually
know anyone here,

213
00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:29.694
so I was just
rereading old texts,

214
00:08:29.718 --> 00:08:30.878
so I don't look like a loser.

215
00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:32.137
So was I.

216
00:08:32.262 --> 00:08:34.139
No one was texting me.

217
00:08:34.305 --> 00:08:36.057
Are you rushing Phi Lambda?

218
00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.350
Yes, I'm Beth.

219
00:08:37.475 --> 00:08:38.601
I'm Shelby.

220
00:08:38.768 --> 00:08:40.395
This is exciting, right?
Yes!

221
00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.563
First frat party.

222
00:08:41.730 --> 00:08:43.277
Yeah, totally.

223
00:08:43.356 --> 00:08:44.403
Totally.

224
00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:47.281
Ten in the bucket.
Yeah, go.

225
00:08:47.402 --> 00:08:48.824
Hey, what's up?
Ten in the bucket.

226
00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:49.903
Okay.

227
00:08:49.946 --> 00:08:50.947
You're cool.
Get in there.

228
00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:54.125
Uh, no way.
This is all of my money.

229
00:08:54.242 --> 00:08:56.119
No, no. We got a runner!
Thank you so much!

230
00:09:15.805 --> 00:09:17.324
Oh, my God. I feel
like this entire room

231
00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:20.318
is just a giant arrow pointing
upstairs so they can fuck us.

232
00:09:20.477 --> 00:09:21.478
Oh, my God!

233
00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.030
'Sup? You wanna
go upstairs?

234
00:09:29.152 --> 00:09:30.449
Who are you asking?

235
00:09:30.612 --> 00:09:33.161
I don't wanna be rude. I really
don't have a preference.

236
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:34.370
No.

237
00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:35.533
'Scuse!

238
00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.044
This isn't exactly
what I expected, you know?

239
00:09:38.203 --> 00:09:40.672
Yeah, you mean this fucking
sucks, right? Yeah.

240
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:42.266
And does no one
know that the same song

241
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.633
keeps playing
over and over again?

242
00:09:43.708 --> 00:09:44.709
Oh, my God, I noticed!

243
00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:46.437
And it makes me want
to blow my brains out.

244
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.480
Hi, I'm Nora, by the way.

245
00:09:47.504 --> 00:09:48.881
Hi, I'm Nora.
Yeah, no.

246
00:09:48.963 --> 00:09:50.323
Let's get out of here!
Let's leave!

247
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:52.809
I am so happy I
found you guys-

248
00:09:52.884 --> 00:09:54.386
That was the most
weird party ever.

249
00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:56.697
I thought college parties were
supposed to be fun or something.

250
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:59.019
Yeah, I felt unsafe.

251
00:09:59.182 --> 00:10:00.729
It was super rapey in there.

252
00:10:00.892 --> 00:10:04.192
If I'm being honest,
I've never done drugs before,

253
00:10:04.354 --> 00:10:06.072
but college is
about new experiences.

254
00:10:06.231 --> 00:10:08.859
And here I am,
and I'm gonna do weed.

255
00:10:09.234 --> 00:10:10.235
Okay.

256
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.533
Just take a little bit.

257
00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:15.331
Wow, that's a big hit.

258
00:10:17.033 --> 00:10:18.876
Oh, my God.
Are you okay?

259
00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.955
Oh, my God. Do you need some water?
Are you okay?

260
00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.874
Oh, my God. I think
she's gonna boot.

261
00:10:24.999 --> 00:10:26.171
If she boots, I boot.

262
00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:31.430
You're beautiful.

263
00:10:31.714 --> 00:10:32.761
She's good.

264
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.935
I think this is my thing now!

265
00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:37.321
I can't believe you
never smoked in high school.

266
00:10:37.345 --> 00:10:38.531
What did you do in high school?

267
00:10:38.555 --> 00:10:40.148
I didn't tell
you guys. Okay.

268
00:10:40.765 --> 00:10:44.565
Um, I've been in a pretty intense
relationship since third grade.

269
00:10:44.686 --> 00:10:46.654
Oh, my God,
like Cory and Topanga?

270
00:10:48.439 --> 00:10:49.691
Stop!
Yes, exactly.

271
00:10:49.858 --> 00:10:50.858
That's such a good call.

272
00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.878
That's the cutest thing I've
ever heard in my literal life.

273
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:54.074
Yeah, exactly like that.

274
00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:57.366
Personally, I've made
love to three men.

275
00:10:57.532 --> 00:10:58.749
Two were black.

276
00:10:59.242 --> 00:11:01.119
And one was Indian.

277
00:11:02.245 --> 00:11:04.543
Um, I've done like
everything, but...

278
00:11:05.582 --> 00:11:06.925
But what?

279
00:11:07.041 --> 00:11:08.418
Like everything you can do,

280
00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:10.595
but that one thing.

281
00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:13.636
You've never eaten
out a guy's ass before?

282
00:11:16.426 --> 00:11:17.643
No, no.

283
00:11:17.802 --> 00:11:19.270
No. I mean, I dunno.

284
00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:22.774
High school kind of sucked,
if we're being totally honest.

285
00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:25.435
Yeah, my dad was super strict,
I had really early curfews.

286
00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:26.996
When he dropped
me off at college,

287
00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:28.237
he gave me a rape whistle

288
00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.782
and this huge speech on how to
behave myself <i>as</i> a young woman.

289
00:11:31.107 --> 00:11:33.155
Yeah, I mean, because
of all that I guess

290
00:11:33.318 --> 00:11:36.663
I didn't really have much of a social
life when I was in high school.

291
00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:38.539
Girl, you don't have
to say it. We get it.

292
00:11:41.784 --> 00:11:42.831
You had no friends.

293
00:11:43.578 --> 00:11:44.750
Knock, knock, knock!

294
00:11:45.455 --> 00:11:47.298
Hey! R.A. coming through.

295
00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:49.130
<i>What up, homes'?</i>

296
00:11:49.292 --> 00:11:50.509
Hi, Dustin!

297
00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:52.511
Kind of smells a little funky!

298
00:11:58.259 --> 00:11:59.260
Hmm.

299
00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:03.647
- Okay. Are we clone here, guys?
<i>- Um...</i>

300
00:12:03.973 --> 00:12:05.600
First warning,
just the first warning.

301
00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:09.479
I'm kidding.

302
00:12:09.812 --> 00:12:11.359
You're adults.
You're in college.

303
00:12:11.522 --> 00:12:13.524
You scared the crap out of me.

304
00:12:13.691 --> 00:12:14.752
Were all of you smoking weed?

305
00:12:14.776 --> 00:12:15.776
We smoked weed.

306
00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:17.320
God damn it!

307
00:12:17.487 --> 00:12:18.830
I fucking knew it!

308
00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:22.117
You don't do drugs.
Do you?

309
00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:23.955
Okay, we're cool?

310
00:12:24.118 --> 00:12:26.621
I'll see you fools later.
Hit me up if you need me.

311
00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:27.789
Peace.

312
00:12:28.122 --> 00:12:29.499
God.

313
00:12:29.666 --> 00:12:30.792
Oh, my God.

314
00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:34.179
I am so sick and tired of all
these guys coming into our lives

315
00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:35.680
and trying to
tell us what to do.

316
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.191
We're not little girls anymore.

317
00:12:37.215 --> 00:12:39.013
We are strong adult women.

318
00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.320
Yeah, and sororities can't
even throw their own parties.

319
00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:42.971
We can't even
enjoy the frat party.

320
00:12:43.054 --> 00:12:44.727
We can't have fun in our dorm.

321
00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:45.927
You know what we should do?

322
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.023
We should start
our own sorority.

323
00:12:49.394 --> 00:12:51.434
One that can party the way
that we want to. Mmm-hmm.

324
00:12:51.521 --> 00:12:53.523
And like, most importantly,

325
00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:56.450
we can make sisters for life.
Yeah!

326
00:12:56.526 --> 00:12:58.128
I wanna be your sister.
I wanna be your sister.

327
00:12:58.152 --> 00:12:59.153
Okay-Oh, my God!

328
00:12:59.362 --> 00:13:01.911
BFF!
BFF! BFF!

329
00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:04.622
I told you guys to
shut the fuck up!

330
00:13:07.036 --> 00:13:08.663
Poker night!

331
00:13:19.215 --> 00:13:21.388
Selfie stick!

332
00:13:24.304 --> 00:13:27.353
Yeah. So I've been designing
Outback Steakhouses.

333
00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:30.018
Congrats.
Lots of Outbacks.

334
00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:31.829
But, dude, tell me what's
going on with your app.

335
00:13:31.853 --> 00:13:33.230
Changing the world and shit.

336
00:13:33.313 --> 00:13:34.735
You know, one dick at a time.

337
00:13:36.607 --> 00:13:38.701
Seriously, that's a great idea, man.
Thank you!

338
00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.953
An app that makes
pics of your dick bigger.

339
00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.038
I meant to tell you,
I enjoyed your TED Talk.

340
00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.794
Oh, thank you so much.
Thanks for watching.

341
00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:46.493
You're so successful.

342
00:13:46.868 --> 00:13:49.838
Well, I'm still a cop,
which is not that bad.

343
00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.380
You know,
it's a lot of rules now.

344
00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:53.254
We gotta wear body
cameras and all of that.

345
00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.653
I don't know why
they gave me one.

346
00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.061
It's not like I'm
gonna shoot myself.

347
00:13:56.085 --> 00:13:58.508
But, hey, I figured if you
can't beat 'em, join 'em.

348
00:13:58.629 --> 00:14:00.733
What are you up to, man? How you doing?
Yeah, that's real good.

349
00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:03.385
Work's been a little
bit of a bummer.

350
00:14:03.676 --> 00:14:05.678
They eliminated
the shirtless models,

351
00:14:05.762 --> 00:14:08.936
so now I have to walk around
in this monkey suit.

352
00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:10.767
Looks like
a really soft sweater.

353
00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:11.994
And then you
know what else, too?

354
00:14:12.018 --> 00:14:14.612
I'm the oldest person
there now by six years.

355
00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.569
I had to cover
for my boss, Mason,

356
00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.441
because he had to
go to his "prom."

357
00:14:18.775 --> 00:14:20.903
When did everyone in
retail get so young?

358
00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:22.613
Hmm.

359
00:14:22.779 --> 00:14:25.123
I just feel, like, really
undervalued, you know?

360
00:14:26.449 --> 00:14:28.201
Yeah, for real.

361
00:14:28.326 --> 00:14:30.249
- At least I have you guys.
- You do!

362
00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:31.830
- I love you guys, man.
- You do.

363
00:14:31.913 --> 00:14:32.960
Delta Psi, man.

364
00:14:33.039 --> 00:14:34.479
Once a week, Delta
week every Monday-

365
00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:35.583
Yeah.
Gotcha.

366
00:14:35.666 --> 00:14:37.668
So, uh, Darren.
Mmm-hmm.

367
00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:39.253
How much you putting in?

368
00:14:39.629 --> 00:14:41.131
I'm going

369
00:14:42.465 --> 00:14:43.466
all in.

370
00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:45.301
Big hand!

371
00:14:45.468 --> 00:14:46.828
Man, what do you got,
a full house?

372
00:14:46.969 --> 00:14:48.061
Hopefully, one day.

373
00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:55.316
<i>Well, you done done
me and you bet I felt it</i>

374
00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.276
Oh, my God.
Our song.

375
00:14:58.314 --> 00:14:59.736
What's going on?

376
00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.321
<i>I fell right through the cracks</i>

377
00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:04.158
<i>Now I'm trying to get back</i>

378
00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:07.870
<i>Oh, I won't hesitate</i>

379
00:15:08.074 --> 00:15:09.496
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

380
00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.498
<i>No more, no more</i>

381
00:15:11.661 --> 00:15:14.631
<i>It cannot wait</i>

382
00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:17.004
<i>I'm yours</i>

383
00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:18.505
Oh, my God.

384
00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.179
The Greeks believed
we were each half of a whole.

385
00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:25.555
Peter, you are the half
that makes me whole-

386
00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:28.056
This is happening! Oh. my God!
Is this happening?

387
00:15:28.136 --> 00:15:29.446
Look, I don't know
what the rules are-.

388
00:15:29.470 --> 00:15:31.768
I don't know who is
supposed to propose to who.

389
00:15:31.848 --> 00:15:33.325
And you're not a ring guy.
You don't have to wear it.

390
00:15:33.349 --> 00:15:35.192
You know, I guess.
No. That's okay.

391
00:15:35.351 --> 00:15:37.103
Wear it for me.
All right.

392
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:38.622
Will you marry me,
Peter McCallister?

393
00:15:38.646 --> 00:15:40.990
Yes, you know I will!
Yes! Put it on.

394
00:15:41.524 --> 00:15:43.367
Okay, one, two, three!

395
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:52.127
USA! USA! USA!

396
00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:54.003
Did he ever tell
you about college?

397
00:15:54.078 --> 00:15:55.580
College was crazy, man!

398
00:15:55.955 --> 00:15:57.878
He used to just crush it.

399
00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.792
Slay tang.

400
00:15:59.876 --> 00:16:01.128
No.
Oh, wow.

401
00:16:01.294 --> 00:16:02.887
You were out of
your mind a little bit.

402
00:16:03.045 --> 00:16:04.388
I was figuring stuff out.

403
00:16:04.505 --> 00:16:07.099
Yeah, figuring stuff
out knee-deep in pussy.

404
00:16:07.216 --> 00:16:08.263
Oh...

405
00:16:08.342 --> 00:16:09.559
I also used to...

406
00:16:09.719 --> 00:16:11.392
I ate pussy.

407
00:16:12.638 --> 00:16:13.890
Not as much as him.

408
00:16:14.223 --> 00:16:15.725
By the way, is it cool...

409
00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.482
Can we talk about the living
situation real quick?

410
00:16:18.561 --> 00:16:20.404
Dude, don't sweat that.
Yeah?

411
00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:21.823
Darren, you can
move in any time.

412
00:16:21.898 --> 00:16:23.616
Dude, he's basically
here every night.

413
00:16:24.066 --> 00:16:25.909
Thank you so much!
Yeah. Right. Okay.

414
00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:29.243
Seriously, though. Would it
be cool if Darren moved in

415
00:16:29.530 --> 00:16:35.037
and then you did
not live here anymore?

416
00:16:35.244 --> 00:16:36.461
What do you mean? Why?

417
00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:39.082
I mean, we're engaged.

418
00:16:39.248 --> 00:16:41.922
What did you think
was gonna happen?

419
00:16:42.335 --> 00:16:43.729
That you two would
move into your room,

420
00:16:43.753 --> 00:16:45.972
and that I would
live in my room.

421
00:16:46.172 --> 00:16:47.719
For happily ever after.

422
00:16:47.798 --> 00:16:50.347
We're thinking maybe, because
Darren works from home

423
00:16:50.426 --> 00:16:53.976
that maybe we would
turn it into an office.

424
00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:57.688
And then, maybe one day

425
00:16:58.267 --> 00:17:01.111
uh, a baby's room.

426
00:17:01.437 --> 00:17:03.280
No, babies are real small.
They are.

427
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:06.401
They're tiny, they're the
size of a little shoebox-

428
00:17:06.692 --> 00:17:08.194
Huh. Doesn't take
up the whole room.

429
00:17:08.277 --> 00:17:09.745
Think of a counter
argument, but I...

430
00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:10.821
Yeah.

431
00:17:10.905 --> 00:17:12.282
Dude, I was just fucking joking.

432
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.792
You were fucking...
Totally fucking with you.

433
00:17:14.951 --> 00:17:16.248
You know what?

434
00:17:16.410 --> 00:17:17.707
I need to go for a run.

435
00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.056
You're gonna go right now for...

436
00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.640
I'm happy for you guys.
I love you guys.

437
00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:23.046
Bring it in, man. Yeah.
Oh, yeah.

438
00:17:24.627 --> 00:17:25.879
Love you, dude.
Love you, man.

439
00:17:26.212 --> 00:17:28.715
Teddy, don't you wanna grab
your shoes, at least?

440
00:17:38.933 --> 00:17:41.436
Look, ladies, the owner of
this house is super cool.

441
00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:44.238
He's like me.
He's cool, he's dope.

442
00:17:44.313 --> 00:17:45.530
You can do anything here.

443
00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:49.823
You can party, you can stay up
all night, play on your phones.

444
00:17:49.902 --> 00:17:51.620
Snapchat that shit,
I don't care.

445
00:17:51.696 --> 00:17:53.039
And smoke weed.

446
00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:55.203
The question is can you afford it?
What's your name?

447
00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:56.367
Shelby.
Shelby.

448
00:17:56.492 --> 00:17:57.664
Look, I'm Team Shelby.

449
00:17:57.827 --> 00:17:59.500
What's your name?
Nora.

450
00:17:59.787 --> 00:18:01.255
Nora. I'm Team Nora.

451
00:18:01.831 --> 00:18:03.003
What?
Beth.

452
00:18:03.207 --> 00:18:04.299
Okay, I'm good.

453
00:18:04.417 --> 00:18:07.170
Look, girls, normally,
it's $25,000 a month.

454
00:18:07.253 --> 00:18:09.802
But I'm willing to offer
it to you for $5,000.

455
00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:11.599
Wow. Can you afford
five grand a month?

456
00:18:11.674 --> 00:18:12.675
No.

457
00:18:13.384 --> 00:18:16.183
Oh, I'm getting
a call-Hold on, please.

458
00:18:16.345 --> 00:18:17.517
Did his phone ring?

459
00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:19.432
I'm so sorry. I have
to take this call.

460
00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.317
It's another
ragtag group of girls

461
00:18:21.392 --> 00:18:22.752
trying to start
their own sorority.

462
00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:25.029
They're real
alternative, real edgy.

463
00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:26.279
What to do?

464
00:18:26.439 --> 00:18:28.000
Guys, we gotta act fast.
What are we gonna do?

465
00:18:28.024 --> 00:18:29.626
I don't know. We don't
have enough for a month.

466
00:18:29.650 --> 00:18:31.027
Shit, what do we do?

467
00:18:31.110 --> 00:18:32.421
I don't know.
You're looking at me

468
00:18:32.445 --> 00:18:33.755
and I don't
really know what to...

469
00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:35.531
Whoa.
Okay, guys.

470
00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:38.209
There is a beautiful centaur
sitting thoughtfully over there.

471
00:18:38.701 --> 00:18:39.827
Who are you?

472
00:18:39.994 --> 00:18:41.712
I'm Teddy Sanders.

473
00:18:43.623 --> 00:18:45.216
I used to live here.

474
00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:47.519
- Why are you limping?
- Are you okay?

475
00:18:47.543 --> 00:18:49.671
I just ran here, barefoot.

476
00:18:50.046 --> 00:18:51.047
Really far.

477
00:18:51.213 --> 00:18:52.214
Huh.

478
00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.192
You guys are thinking about
renting this place?

479
00:18:54.216 --> 00:18:55.217
Maybe.

480
00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:57.224
What do you guys want
with such a big house?

481
00:18:57.303 --> 00:18:58.646
We're starting our own sorority

482
00:18:58.721 --> 00:18:59.813
outside the system

483
00:18:59.889 --> 00:19:01.849
- that can totally do whatever it wants.
- Yeah.

484
00:19:02.058 --> 00:19:04.686
Mmm-hmm. Like throw dope-ass
parties and totally rage-

485
00:19:04.852 --> 00:19:06.149
A sorority that can party?

486
00:19:06.395 --> 00:19:07.612
Kappa Nu.

487
00:19:07.688 --> 00:19:09.486
What's wrong with
fraternity parties?

488
00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:11.617
What isn't?

489
00:19:11.734 --> 00:19:13.532
We threw great parties here.

490
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:15.743
Pimps and Hoes,

491
00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:18.124
CEOs and Corporate Hoes,

492
00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:20.417
Boise Boys and Ida-Hoes.

493
00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:22.416
They're, like, super sexist.

494
00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:24.543
Every party is, like, themed hoe.

495
00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:26.999
I mean...

496
00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.255
Jeez.

497
00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:32.714
Oh, no! Oh, God!

498
00:19:33.422 --> 00:19:34.469
Mmm-hmm.

499
00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:36.263
Yeah, I see your point.

500
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:38.519
Honestly, though, it's kind
of a fucking moot point.

501
00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:41.689
We got to figure
out something else.

502
00:19:41.764 --> 00:19:42.890
We can't afford this place.

503
00:19:43.099 --> 00:19:45.339
How much money do you guys
have between the three of you?

504
00:19:45.434 --> 00:19:46.981
Maybe a few thousand dollars.

505
00:19:47.061 --> 00:19:48.779
That's if you really
pool it all together,

506
00:19:48.896 --> 00:19:50.569
and that's for
the entire school year.

507
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.533
So use that as a down payment,

508
00:19:52.608 --> 00:19:55.031
throw a rush event,
get a bunch of members.

509
00:19:55.277 --> 00:19:56.449
They'll pay their dues,

510
00:19:56.529 --> 00:19:58.827
plus you'll have an army of
people to make money for you.

511
00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:01.159
And then pretty soon, you're
a full-fledged sorority.

512
00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:03.244
Right? Do you guys have
the rental agreement?

513
00:20:03.411 --> 00:20:07.416
I don't understand one thing
that you just said to us.

514
00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.463
Last week, I was
sleeping in a bunk bed.

515
00:20:09.542 --> 00:20:10.543
Yeah.

516
00:20:10.626 --> 00:20:11.878
I can't make an Eggo!

517
00:20:11.961 --> 00:20:13.554
I can't make one.
I don't know how.

518
00:20:13.629 --> 00:20:15.597
We're 18. We know
what we wanna do.

519
00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:17.804
We have no earthly idea
how to accomplish it.

520
00:20:17.967 --> 00:20:20.311
I ran Delta Psi for four years.

521
00:20:20.636 --> 00:20:22.730
I could definitely help you.
Okay.

522
00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:25.061
I mean, would that be, like,

523
00:20:25.891 --> 00:20:27.609
of value to you?

524
00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:31.985
Yeah, that'd be,
like, of tremendous value.

525
00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:33.315
Really?

526
00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:35.784
We should, like, celebrate!

527
00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:36.861
Yeah!
Okay.

528
00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:39.413
Dude, who wants to
take a rip on the zip?

529
00:20:39.697 --> 00:20:40.966
Go for it!
Dude, check this out!

530
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.991
Okay.

531
00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.751
I swear, we used to
ride this baby tandem.

532
00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:47.417
Check this out. Delta Psi!

533
00:20:48.330 --> 00:20:49.377
On...

534
00:20:49.457 --> 00:20:50.504
Dude, are you okay?

535
00:20:50.666 --> 00:20:52.464
I'm fine.
Yeah, I'm good.

536
00:20:52.626 --> 00:20:54.424
Legally, this is
not my responsibility.

537
00:20:55.254 --> 00:20:56.301
We'll take it.

538
00:20:57.339 --> 00:20:58.431
Dope!

539
00:20:59.842 --> 00:21:00.934
Are you okay, dude?

540
00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.251
Yeah, I'm totally fine.

541
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:03.429
I'm really hyped.

542
00:21:03.512 --> 00:21:04.906
I think it's gonna be
the perfect house for us.

543
00:21:04.930 --> 00:21:06.074
Yeah, I'm so excited, you guys.

544
00:21:06.098 --> 00:21:07.350
It's gonna be good.

545
00:21:07.516 --> 00:21:09.189
- I'll see you guys soon.
- Thank you.

546
00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:10.352
Thanks.

547
00:21:10.436 --> 00:21:11.437
Is that Teddy Sanders?

548
00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:13.147
Oh, shit. Oh, no.
Who are they?

549
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:14.607
GO, go!
Guys. go-

550
00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.490
Go, get out of here.
I'll explain later, okay?

551
00:21:17.193 --> 00:21:19.036
Mac! Kelly! Hey,
Yo!

552
00:21:19.195 --> 00:21:20.196
What's going on?

553
00:21:20.362 --> 00:21:21.363
What's going on, man?

554
00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:23.119
What are you guys doing here?

555
00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.201
You live here. Yeah, of course.
Who are they?

556
00:21:25.284 --> 00:21:26.456
Don't worry about them.

557
00:21:26.535 --> 00:21:27.536
Okay.

558
00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.042
So, I see you guys are moving?

559
00:21:29.205 --> 00:21:30.457
Moving on up, yeah.

560
00:21:30.623 --> 00:21:31.715
Well, heck.

561
00:21:31.874 --> 00:21:33.685
You could have done that
when I was living here.

562
00:21:33.709 --> 00:21:35.211
That would have been nice.

563
00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:36.879
Yeah, I know. Just
weren't ready yet.

564
00:21:37.213 --> 00:21:39.557
I have a criminal record
now because of you guys.

565
00:21:40.382 --> 00:21:42.305
Look out.

566
00:21:42.468 --> 00:21:44.937
No, for real. Like,
it's hard to get jobs.

567
00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:47.157
So, it's been really tough.

568
00:21:47.181 --> 00:21:48.450
So, what are you
doing here? Buddy.

569
00:21:48.474 --> 00:21:49.701
Yeah, what brings
you to the hood?

570
00:21:49.725 --> 00:21:51.227
You guys will
find out soon enough.

571
00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:52.394
What does that mean?
Huh?

572
00:21:52.478 --> 00:21:54.151
Don't worry about it.
It's cool.

573
00:21:54.563 --> 00:21:56.907
It's good to see you guys.
Kind of missed you.

574
00:21:57.066 --> 00:21:58.067
See you soon.

575
00:21:58.609 --> 00:21:59.826
All right. See ya.

576
00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:16.260
<i>Yo. You wanna rush
the coolest sorority ever?</i>

577
00:22:16.335 --> 00:22:17.587
<i>This is the one.</i>

578
00:22:17.753 --> 00:22:21.098
<i>Kappa Nu welcomes you.</i>

579
00:22:41.277 --> 00:22:42.995
What the hell?

580
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:45.452
Oh.

581
00:22:46.282 --> 00:22:48.034
There's people there.

582
00:22:48.117 --> 00:22:49.664
Somebody move in?

583
00:22:49.910 --> 00:22:52.083
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me.

584
00:22:52.538 --> 00:22:54.131
Hi.
Hi.

585
00:22:54.206 --> 00:22:55.753
What the fuck?

586
00:22:55.833 --> 00:22:57.585
What's happening here?

587
00:22:57.668 --> 00:22:59.636
"Kappa Nu. Wants you."
What the fuck?

588
00:22:59.712 --> 00:23:01.680
Hi! We're your neighbours.
Hi. Hello!

589
00:23:01.755 --> 00:23:02.755
Oh, hi.

590
00:23:02.798 --> 00:23:04.596
Mac and Kelly.
Hi, I'm Kelly.

591
00:23:04.675 --> 00:23:07.394
Are your parents around
or something like that?

592
00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:08.770
Oh, no, no, no.

593
00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:10.556
Meet the girls of Kappa Nu.

594
00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.103
What's that then?

595
00:23:12.224 --> 00:23:13.601
It's our sorority.

596
00:23:16.061 --> 00:23:20.658
Hi, neighbours!

597
00:23:21.358 --> 00:23:23.702
Do you want
a beer or a mocktail?

598
00:23:23.861 --> 00:23:25.579
Like a mommy mocktail?
Congratulations.

599
00:23:25.738 --> 00:23:27.035
Oh, sure.
I'll take a mocktail.

600
00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:29.036
Get this woman a mocktail.

601
00:23:29.116 --> 00:23:30.413
Great. Thank you.

602
00:23:30.492 --> 00:23:32.494
Shelby will get them for you.
Thank you.

603
00:23:32.661 --> 00:23:34.129
Thanks a lot.

604
00:23:34.538 --> 00:23:36.381
What the fuck?
What are we gonna do?

605
00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:37.917
I don't fucking know.

606
00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.469
The buyers are not gonna
want to live next to a house

607
00:23:40.586 --> 00:23:41.838
with a fucking sorority in it.

608
00:23:42.004 --> 00:23:43.231
No, no. ls now a good
time to freak out?

609
00:23:43.255 --> 00:23:44.455
Should I freak out?
No, no, no.

610
00:23:44.548 --> 00:23:45.984
Should I start screaming?
Come on. No, no.

611
00:23:46.008 --> 00:23:47.726
Okay, look.

612
00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:49.641
We've just gotta
convince them to chill.

613
00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:51.722
We just need them
to behave themselves.

614
00:23:51.805 --> 00:23:53.325
We just ask them not to
party while we're escrow.

615
00:23:53.349 --> 00:23:54.350
We'll be fine.

616
00:23:54.433 --> 00:23:56.777
As soon as we're not escrow,
go fucking apeshit.

617
00:23:57.019 --> 00:23:58.066
Hey. guys.

618
00:23:58.187 --> 00:23:59.689
Hey.
What's up?

619
00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:02.366
Um, can we have a quick chat
with you guys for a second?

620
00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.443
We kind of had
a question for you guys.

621
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.908
You see, we live next door,
we just sold our house,

622
00:24:06.987 --> 00:24:09.035
and we're escrowing
for the next 30 days.

623
00:24:09.114 --> 00:24:12.459
And, basically, if anything
happens that spooks those buyers,

624
00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:16.380
they'll pull out of the deal, and
we'll own two homes and be fucked.

625
00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:20.714
So it'd just be great if
you could be mellow and low-key,

626
00:24:20.876 --> 00:24:23.880
and just basically not party
for 30 days- And that's it.

627
00:24:23.963 --> 00:24:25.148
Then we'll be gone.
You go crazy.

628
00:24:25.172 --> 00:24:26.358
We'll be out of
your hair. Yeah.

629
00:24:26.382 --> 00:24:27.383
Urn...

630
00:24:28.342 --> 00:24:29.559
Well, here's the thing.

631
00:24:29.718 --> 00:24:34.565
A really big part of us creating
this sorority is because

632
00:24:34.807 --> 00:24:37.526
fraternities are
allowed to party

633
00:24:37.643 --> 00:24:40.362
and sororities are
not allowed to party.

634
00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:41.738
Really?
What?

635
00:24:41.897 --> 00:24:44.241
Yeah, so partying is
a really big deal for us.

636
00:24:44.525 --> 00:24:46.402
And you guys have
a daughter, I'm sure

637
00:24:46.527 --> 00:24:48.404
you'd want her to have
equal rights <i>as</i> guys.

638
00:24:49.321 --> 00:24:53.622
As a man, I could not
agree with you more,

639
00:24:53.742 --> 00:24:56.837
and could not
support your cause more.

640
00:24:56.912 --> 00:25:00.166
I think my wife has
some thoughts though

641
00:25:00.249 --> 00:25:02.843
on maybe why you guys could
approach this differently.

642
00:25:03.085 --> 00:25:04.257
Kelly.
What?

643
00:25:05.295 --> 00:25:06.342
Take it.

644
00:25:07.423 --> 00:25:09.175
Ladies, we can come
to some sort of

645
00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:11.101
compromise here, can't we?

646
00:25:11.176 --> 00:25:13.554
I'm sure maybe...
No means no!

647
00:25:13.929 --> 00:25:14.930
'Sup, neighbours?

648
00:25:15.139 --> 00:25:16.186
Teddy?

649
00:25:16.265 --> 00:25:17.517
Welcome to soon enough.

650
00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.852
What does that mean?

651
00:25:20.102 --> 00:25:21.524
You don't remember
when I told you

652
00:25:21.645 --> 00:25:23.067
that you'd find out soon enough?

653
00:25:23.689 --> 00:25:25.569
I think a lot of this
is going on in your head-.

654
00:25:25.607 --> 00:25:27.234
I'm mentoring this sorority.

655
00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:28.656
Why?
That's a thing?

656
00:25:28.777 --> 00:25:29.778
Yes, it's a thing.

657
00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:30.950
Why are you doing that?

658
00:25:31.113 --> 00:25:33.491
I don't know.
Why do butterflies fly?

659
00:25:33.574 --> 00:25:34.666
To drink nectar.

660
00:25:35.409 --> 00:25:38.162
I don't know why things do
what they do, but what I do

661
00:25:38.537 --> 00:25:41.791
is facilitate the act of
partying in this house.

662
00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:42.958
What?

663
00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:44.839
So let's rage!

664
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:52.142
Missed you guys.

665
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:57.393
<i>These are the rules for
a successful sorority.</i>

666
00:25:57.473 --> 00:25:58.474
<i>Rule number one.</i>

667
00:25:58.682 --> 00:26:01.481
<i>Use these money buckets
to keep track of your cash.</i>

668
00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.484
<i>Five buckets a month
equals house rent.</i>

669
00:26:04.772 --> 00:26:05.819
<i>Rule number two.</i>

670
00:26:06.315 --> 00:26:09.159
<i>Keep getting pledges and you
can dress them up like idiots.</i>

671
00:26:10.319 --> 00:26:11.696
Minions! Minions!

672
00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:13.948
They got a hilarious
army of fucking Minions.

673
00:26:14.156 --> 00:26:15.876
I love Minions, and now
I have to hate them.

674
00:26:15.949 --> 00:26:17.509
They're making me
hate something I love.

675
00:26:21.663 --> 00:26:24.166
<i>Rule number three.
Throw the type of parties</i>

676
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:26.001
<i>that show what you
guys are all about.</i>

677
00:26:26.085 --> 00:26:27.678
Hillary Clinton.

678
00:26:27.753 --> 00:26:30.723
Joan of Arc orders
you to pass the joint.

679
00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:32.432
First Lady Hillary Clinton?

680
00:26:32.591 --> 00:26:34.184
Or Senator Hillary Clinton?

681
00:26:34.301 --> 00:26:35.803
Or future President
Hillary Clinton?

682
00:26:36.595 --> 00:26:38.723
Oprah, we're out of beer.

683
00:26:38.806 --> 00:26:40.854
Everybody look under their chairs.

684
00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.853
You're all getting beer!

685
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:48.278
You get a beer, you get
a beer, you get a beer.

686
00:26:48.524 --> 00:26:49.867
I love you, Oprah.

687
00:26:50.025 --> 00:26:51.493
Could you please be quiet?

688
00:26:51.652 --> 00:26:53.370
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

689
00:26:56.448 --> 00:26:58.246
<i>I cannot tell you
how thankful I am...</i>

690
00:27:00.953 --> 00:27:02.955
<i>I love you so much.</i>

691
00:27:09.294 --> 00:27:12.173
It's not fair!
They're too young!

692
00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:19.896
Why don't they shut up!

693
00:27:20.055 --> 00:27:21.375
- Just stop it!
- Stop it!

694
00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:22.520
Shut up!

695
00:27:34.194 --> 00:27:35.195
Please.
Please!

696
00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:36.548
We're begging you!
All right, listen.

697
00:27:36.572 --> 00:27:40.167
I cannot shut down a sorority that's
trying to become independent.

698
00:27:40.242 --> 00:27:41.243
Why not?

699
00:27:41.326 --> 00:27:43.328
It's a PR nightmare.

700
00:27:43.412 --> 00:27:44.664
What's the nightmare?

701
00:27:44.746 --> 00:27:45.747
For example,

702
00:27:45.831 --> 00:27:49.335
"Sexist female dean
shuts down sorority."

703
00:27:50.419 --> 00:27:52.421
That is reverse sexism.

704
00:27:52.588 --> 00:27:54.090
Which is, in and of itself,

705
00:27:54.173 --> 00:27:55.390
a sexist thing to do.

706
00:27:55.591 --> 00:27:58.936
There's no such thing as
reverse sexism, Mr. White Man.

707
00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:01.768
Oh, okay. Hey, don't
talk to me like that,

708
00:28:01.847 --> 00:28:03.019
because I am Jewish.

709
00:28:03.098 --> 00:28:04.099
I am a minority.

710
00:28:04.224 --> 00:28:06.602
Well, less of you.
Like Labradoodles.

711
00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:07.777
Okay.

712
00:28:07.936 --> 00:28:10.780
Look, if they get three strikes
they have to shut down, right?

713
00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:12.979
As far as I'm concerned,
they have infinite strikes.

714
00:28:13.108 --> 00:28:15.452
I see we're playing outside
the rules of the system,

715
00:28:15.611 --> 00:28:17.739
so why don't we go to Plan B?

716
00:28:17.905 --> 00:28:22.376
Here's a little something
to change your mind.

717
00:28:22.993 --> 00:28:24.336
Mmm.

718
00:28:27.122 --> 00:28:28.749
Do we have a deal, chancellor?

719
00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:29.833
No.

720
00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:31.294
You know what, fuck you!

721
00:28:31.376 --> 00:28:32.593
Unleash the hounds, sweetie.

722
00:28:32.753 --> 00:28:34.881
That's how you talk
in front of your daughter?

723
00:28:35.047 --> 00:28:36.441
Oh, I think we know
how to be parents.

724
00:28:36.465 --> 00:28:38.843
She's a baby, She doesn't
retain any of that shit.

725
00:28:38.926 --> 00:28:40.394
Well, yes she will.
No, she doesn't.

726
00:28:40.469 --> 00:28:41.470
Watch.

727
00:28:41.803 --> 00:28:43.430
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

728
00:28:43.597 --> 00:28:44.644
Fuck.

729
00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:47.818
What's she watching on her iPad?
Goodfellas.

730
00:28:48.018 --> 00:28:49.895
Ha, ha, ha.
Jokes on you.

731
00:28:49.978 --> 00:28:51.821
I don't know what she's
watching on that iPad.

732
00:28:53.565 --> 00:28:54.645
What are we gonna do?

733
00:28:54.775 --> 00:28:55.992
We have an inspection soon.

734
00:28:56.151 --> 00:28:58.279
The buyers could literally
drive by at any moment,

735
00:28:58.362 --> 00:28:59.989
say, "Oh, the house
has a few leaks,

736
00:29:00.072 --> 00:29:01.745
"and there's 20
fucking psychopathic

737
00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:03.166
"teenagers living
next door."

738
00:29:03.283 --> 00:29:04.580
We're gonna have two houses.

739
00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.845
And then we'll have no houses.

740
00:29:05.869 --> 00:29:07.121
And then we're screwed.

741
00:29:07.246 --> 00:29:08.247
We're totally screwed.

742
00:29:08.330 --> 00:29:09.673
Hi, sweetie. Hi, baby.
Hey.

743
00:29:09.831 --> 00:29:10.934
We just got to get rid of them.

744
00:29:10.958 --> 00:29:12.101
I couldn't talk to those girls.

745
00:29:12.125 --> 00:29:13.311
No. We had middle
ground with the guys.

746
00:29:13.335 --> 00:29:14.461
We could talk to the guys.

747
00:29:14.544 --> 00:29:15.921
Yes!
They look at us like

748
00:29:16.004 --> 00:29:17.941
it was like their grandparents
walked into that house.

749
00:29:17.965 --> 00:29:20.514
Right? Stella is not gonna
turn out like that.

750
00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:21.593
No.
No.

751
00:29:21.677 --> 00:29:23.304
She'll be our best
friend forever-Yeah.

752
00:29:23.428 --> 00:29:25.396
She loves talking to us.
Yeah. We're a team.

753
00:29:25.472 --> 00:29:26.564
Right, Stella?

754
00:29:26.640 --> 00:29:28.483
Come over here, Stella.
Come here.

755
00:29:30.769 --> 00:29:32.191
Honey, wanna come over here?

756
00:29:32.271 --> 00:29:35.024
What the fuck? What
the fuck is wrong with her?

757
00:29:35.732 --> 00:29:37.700
Play with your toy, sweetie.
Play with your toy.

758
00:29:37.776 --> 00:29:39.629
Just keep playing with your toy.
Give him a kiss.

759
00:29:39.653 --> 00:29:41.496
You know who kids listen to?

760
00:29:41.697 --> 00:29:43.825
Their parents. Celebrities.
Their parents.

761
00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:46.827
What's up...

762
00:29:46.994 --> 00:29:48.337
Hey, Dad!

763
00:29:48.453 --> 00:29:49.454
You started a sorority?

764
00:29:49.538 --> 00:29:50.848
You're supposed to
be living in the dorm,

765
00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:53.000
not in some old
dilapidated mansion!

766
00:29:53.083 --> 00:29:54.130
This is what you want?

767
00:29:54.209 --> 00:29:56.229
You wanna live like some
sort of a drifter murderer?

768
00:29:56.253 --> 00:29:57.550
I can do whatever I want here.

769
00:29:57.713 --> 00:29:58.856
Dad, that's the
point of college.

770
00:29:58.880 --> 00:29:59.927
I'm my own parent.

771
00:30:00.007 --> 00:30:01.975
When did you start
talking like Eminem?

772
00:30:02.050 --> 00:30:04.178
I'm gonna talk like this.
I'm gonna talk like that.

773
00:30:04.344 --> 00:30:05.470
This is ridiculous!

774
00:30:05.554 --> 00:30:07.181
Look at that pizza,
how old is that?

775
00:30:07.264 --> 00:30:09.187
The cheese is moldy on that.

776
00:30:09.391 --> 00:30:10.517
Cheese is mold.

777
00:30:10.726 --> 00:30:12.228
I can eat it,
whenever I want it.

778
00:30:12.311 --> 00:30:14.188
God, have you
inherited my stupid gene?

779
00:30:14.271 --> 00:30:15.272
Look at you.

780
00:30:15.355 --> 00:30:16.995
So you get to be just
as dumb as boys now?

781
00:30:17.065 --> 00:30:18.317
Is that what you learned here?

782
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.627
You are going back to the dorm!

783
00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.528
No! This is where
I chose to live.

784
00:30:21.611 --> 00:30:23.454
It is only Kappa Nu.

785
00:30:27.075 --> 00:30:29.544
Looks like my
little girl's growing up.

786
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:32.922
Thanks, Dad.

787
00:30:33.874 --> 00:30:37.845
I can buy your girlfriends and
you some brunch, if you want?

788
00:30:38.003 --> 00:30:39.255
I kind of need some new jeans.

789
00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:40.596
Oh, we can go shopping then.

790
00:30:40.756 --> 00:30:42.008
Yeah, cool.

791
00:30:43.258 --> 00:30:44.818
How did it go? Yeah.
They gonna be cool?

792
00:30:44.843 --> 00:30:46.070
Did you punish them or whatever?

793
00:30:46.094 --> 00:30:48.517
I tried my best, but
there's nothing I can do.

794
00:30:48.597 --> 00:30:49.598
What do you mean?
What?

795
00:30:49.681 --> 00:30:50.682
Ah. You'll know.

796
00:30:50.766 --> 00:30:52.234
When they're two
years old, you can

797
00:30:52.351 --> 00:30:53.870
get them to do
almost anything you want.

798
00:30:53.894 --> 00:30:56.094
Get a little bit older, and
it's harder to control them.

799
00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:58.652
I do not understand
a word she says.

800
00:30:59.066 --> 00:31:01.740
But it was good to see her.

801
00:31:01.902 --> 00:31:04.576
- The house is so quiet without her.
- Oh...

802
00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.201
I'm fine.

803
00:31:09.576 --> 00:31:10.577
Gosh.

804
00:31:11.078 --> 00:31:12.295
Beautiful child.

805
00:31:13.872 --> 00:31:14.873
Can I hold her?

806
00:31:14.956 --> 00:31:17.630
No, no, no. That's okay.
That's great.

807
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:19.878
Is that a dildo
dressed as a princess?

808
00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:24.220
Nope. That is a popular children's
cartoon character of today.

809
00:31:26.051 --> 00:31:27.644
Thank you for trying.

810
00:31:28.929 --> 00:31:30.226
- Hey, meanies!
- Hi!

811
00:31:30.389 --> 00:31:31.732
You called my parents?

812
00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:33.476
Yes, we did call your parents.

813
00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:34.977
Yes. We did.
We actually did.

814
00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:36.061
Oh, really?

815
00:31:36.228 --> 00:31:37.980
It's 30 days!
It's just 30 days!

816
00:31:38.146 --> 00:31:40.240
It's 30 days! Then
we won't be escrow!

817
00:31:40.315 --> 00:31:42.693
Then we'll be out of your hair!
It's 30 fucking days.

818
00:31:42.776 --> 00:31:44.574
It's all we're asking for.

819
00:31:44.778 --> 00:31:45.825
It's on.

820
00:31:45.987 --> 00:31:47.239
No, no, no.
No.

821
00:31:47.322 --> 00:31:49.074
Nothing's on.
Why would it be on?

822
00:31:49.157 --> 00:31:51.000
No, it's on. But we're
turning it off.

823
00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:53.388
If we turned it on, we can turn it off.
Can we just turn it off?

824
00:31:53.412 --> 00:31:54.413
It's on.

825
00:31:56.456 --> 00:31:59.084
Hey, Mac!
Hey, Mac!

826
00:32:01.169 --> 00:32:03.672
Great! I see more
of you have moved in.

827
00:32:05.006 --> 00:32:07.680
This is private property.
You're trespassing.

828
00:32:07.843 --> 00:32:09.186
Hey, Mac.

829
00:32:09.344 --> 00:32:11.597
Looks like Beth needs some
suntan lotion on her.

830
00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:12.977
I think she's okay.

831
00:32:13.056 --> 00:32:14.854
Leave me alone.
You're not going.

832
00:32:18.186 --> 00:32:19.426
Where am I?

833
00:32:25.444 --> 00:32:26.616
Oh, no.

834
00:32:26.695 --> 00:32:27.912
I killed a girl!

835
00:32:29.030 --> 00:32:30.657
I'm on painkillers,
motherfucker!

836
00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.787
Kappa Nu!

837
00:32:33.201 --> 00:32:35.374
What the fuck is wrong with you?

838
00:32:38.165 --> 00:32:40.384
Get away! Go away!

839
00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:46.006
Get out of here, you animals!

840
00:32:46.131 --> 00:32:47.633
This isn't working!

841
00:32:47.757 --> 00:32:49.350
You're only making them sexier!

842
00:32:51.553 --> 00:32:55.148
I don't like it!
I don't like it!

843
00:32:57.225 --> 00:32:58.898
What the hell was that?
Was that a bird?

844
00:33:04.441 --> 00:33:06.193
What the hell is that?

845
00:33:10.030 --> 00:33:11.077
Oh, no!

846
00:33:11.198 --> 00:33:12.245
Oh, God! Tampons!

847
00:33:12.407 --> 00:33:13.408
Oh, that's filthy!

848
00:33:13.533 --> 00:33:14.750
Stop it, you animals!

849
00:33:15.243 --> 00:33:16.745
Get off! Stop it!
Oh!

850
00:33:16.912 --> 00:33:18.038
Oh, my God! Mac!

851
00:33:18.413 --> 00:33:20.040
The other window is open!

852
00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:25.508
That was really funny!

853
00:33:25.587 --> 00:33:27.510
Where'd you guys get
so much fake blood?

854
00:33:27.589 --> 00:33:29.341
Oh, from our vaginas.

855
00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:30.425
That was real?

856
00:33:30.509 --> 00:33:33.058
Yeah, it was our uterine
wall sloughing off.

857
00:33:33.386 --> 00:33:34.933
You just threw...

858
00:33:35.096 --> 00:33:37.269
That was really gross.

859
00:33:38.934 --> 00:33:40.777
Ugh. Why'd
you do that?

860
00:33:40.852 --> 00:33:42.695
That was way over the line.

861
00:33:42.854 --> 00:33:44.356
Whoa. That's,
like, super sexist.

862
00:33:44.439 --> 00:33:46.191
It was really fucking funny.

863
00:33:46.358 --> 00:33:47.405
You would've been like,

864
00:33:47.484 --> 00:33:49.378
"It's so funny,"
if it was a bag of dicks-

865
00:33:49.402 --> 00:33:51.325
"Look, it's a bag of
dicks on the window!"

866
00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:52.621
No, that...

867
00:33:56.451 --> 00:33:58.078
A bag of dicks.

868
00:34:01.790 --> 00:34:03.792
Yeah, you got me.
That's funny.

869
00:34:04.668 --> 00:34:05.965
A bag of dicks.

870
00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:09.931
Here's the deal.
First inspection, tomorrow.

871
00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:11.888
We need help-We have
to get rid of the girls

872
00:34:12.008 --> 00:34:13.736
tomorrow, from the house,
between 10:00 and 5:00.

873
00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.760
Exactly.

874
00:34:14.803 --> 00:34:17.852
If our home owners see these
girls, our escrowment's gonna end.

875
00:34:17.931 --> 00:34:19.158
And these girls are fucked, man.

876
00:34:19.182 --> 00:34:20.368
They're from
another fucking planet.

877
00:34:20.392 --> 00:34:21.827
Yeah. They're
worse than the guys.

878
00:34:21.851 --> 00:34:24.320
Look. Brainstorming
sesh starting now.

879
00:34:24.646 --> 00:34:26.648
Guys, a play on a classic.

880
00:34:26.815 --> 00:34:28.488
We "hoes before bros" them.

881
00:34:28.650 --> 00:34:29.742
No, no, no.

882
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:31.003
No. That's not gonna work. Why?

883
00:34:31.027 --> 00:34:33.029
Because you put hoes before bros.
Always. Yeah.

884
00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.299
It worked with the guys. Why
won't it work with the girls?

885
00:34:35.323 --> 00:34:37.291
Because girls are
much smarter than guys!

886
00:34:37.450 --> 00:34:38.576
That is sexist!

887
00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:40.495
- That's not sexist.
- What is it?

888
00:34:40.662 --> 00:34:42.130
Not when it's against guys.

889
00:34:42.205 --> 00:34:43.331
That's not sexist.

890
00:34:43.498 --> 00:34:45.000
I don't even know what's sexist.

891
00:34:45.166 --> 00:34:46.418
Hey, men's rights.

892
00:34:46.585 --> 00:34:48.007
No, fuck you!

893
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:49.647
Are you okay?
Why are you itching?

894
00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:50.718
What's wrong with you?

895
00:34:50.797 --> 00:34:52.149
Did you get poison
oak or something?

896
00:34:52.173 --> 00:34:53.299
Here's the deal.

897
00:34:54.134 --> 00:34:55.135
We got bedbugs.

898
00:34:55.218 --> 00:34:56.845
- No! Gross!
- Oh, my God!

899
00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:57.989
I'm sorry. I come
to this restaurant.

900
00:34:58.013 --> 00:34:59.156
I don't wanna be embarrassed.

901
00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.491
That's even worse!
Don't embarrass us!

902
00:35:00.515 --> 00:35:01.607
<i>It's gross!</i>

903
00:35:01.683 --> 00:35:03.661
Hey, it's fine, okay? We're
dealing with the problem.

904
00:35:03.685 --> 00:35:05.805
We tented our house. We have
to be out for three days.

905
00:35:09.649 --> 00:35:12.448
This is such a good idea.
These clothes have so many bedbugs.

906
00:35:12.527 --> 00:35:14.171
Just shut up, we just
gotta infest them fast!

907
00:35:14.195 --> 00:35:15.631
Here's some more pledges.
They're bedbugs!

908
00:35:15.655 --> 00:35:16.655
Boom!

909
00:35:16.698 --> 00:35:17.758
These are my best pants!

910
00:35:17.782 --> 00:35:18.843
I don't care about
your fucking pants.

911
00:35:18.867 --> 00:35:20.744
All I care about is bedbugs.
Get it in. Hurry.

912
00:35:20.827 --> 00:35:22.907
It's so hot in here. Can't
see in this fucking thing.

913
00:35:23.038 --> 00:35:24.307
That sheet has so many bedbugs.

914
00:35:24.331 --> 00:35:26.709
I feel them!
I can feel them! Get it off!

915
00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:27.883
Oh, my God!

916
00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:34.220
Hello, hello!

917
00:35:34.382 --> 00:35:36.805
We're entering!
Put on your clothes!

918
00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:37.969
Hi!
Hi!

919
00:35:38.136 --> 00:35:39.888
Welcome!
Hello.

920
00:35:40.055 --> 00:35:41.682
Great! Good to
see you guys!

921
00:35:41.848 --> 00:35:43.117
Good to see you again.
Welcome back!

922
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:44.518
The place looks great.
Yes.

923
00:35:44.726 --> 00:35:46.228
I brought my boyfriend by.

924
00:35:46.394 --> 00:35:48.738
Just kidding. It's the mold
inspector, the old mold king.

925
00:35:48.897 --> 00:35:50.458
You don't think there's
actually mold here, do you?

926
00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:53.736
We kind of smelled a little something
weird when we were here before.

927
00:35:53.902 --> 00:35:54.962
Just wanted to
double-check.

928
00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:56.078
Why not, right?
Yeah.

929
00:35:56.571 --> 00:35:57.571
Great!
Cool.

930
00:35:57.614 --> 00:35:58.866
That's why we're here.

931
00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.343
What's going on
over there, by the way?

932
00:36:00.367 --> 00:36:01.368
New tenants?

933
00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:03.036
Yes, a new family
moved in next door

934
00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:04.722
and they're just doing
a little fumigating.

935
00:36:04.746 --> 00:36:06.999
Very nice, quiet, lovely family.

936
00:36:07.123 --> 00:36:08.124
Family, huh?

937
00:36:08.208 --> 00:36:10.688
It must be pretty big. That place
is huge, like eight bedrooms.

938
00:36:10.752 --> 00:36:11.753
It is.
It is.

939
00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:14.259
This is a very religious family.

940
00:36:14.339 --> 00:36:16.842
They're Jewish,
and they're lovely.

941
00:36:16.925 --> 00:36:18.552
Yeah, why did you
just do... You know?

942
00:36:18.802 --> 00:36:19.928
Anyway, they're lovely.

943
00:36:20.136 --> 00:36:22.434
I think there they
are now, actually.

944
00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:24.733
- Look! It's our Jewish neighbours.
- Oh, hello-

945
00:36:24.891 --> 00:36:26.438
Proof they actually exist.

946
00:36:29.229 --> 00:36:30.230
And she's pregnant.

947
00:36:30.397 --> 00:36:32.445
Got another
little Jew in the oven.

948
00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:36.379
Why don't we start
the mold inspection?

949
00:36:36.403 --> 00:36:37.403
Come into your house.

950
00:36:37.445 --> 00:36:38.867
Come on in.
Come into your home.

951
00:36:38.947 --> 00:36:40.699
Why don't we start in your kitchen?
Yes.

952
00:36:40.782 --> 00:36:41.829
This place is weird.

953
00:36:41.908 --> 00:36:43.000
Yeah.

954
00:36:51.126 --> 00:36:52.799
Uh, Teddy, where are
you gonna be staying?

955
00:36:53.962 --> 00:36:55.464
Uh, right now?

956
00:36:55.630 --> 00:36:57.430
I'm helping a bunch of
girls build a sorority.

957
00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.910
They're moving
into our old house,

958
00:36:58.967 --> 00:37:00.527
so I'll probably
just move in with them.

959
00:37:01.219 --> 00:37:02.846
It's a big step forward for me.

960
00:37:05.056 --> 00:37:06.273
Okay.
Yeah.

961
00:37:06.433 --> 00:37:07.730
That's super weird.

962
00:37:07.809 --> 00:37:09.849
It's actually not weird.
It's actually super normal.

963
00:37:10.228 --> 00:37:11.872
Whatever makes you happy, right?

964
00:37:11.896 --> 00:37:13.614
Darren, can you
back the fuck off?

965
00:37:13.773 --> 00:37:15.491
Whoa, whoa,
Teddy! Relax!

966
00:37:15.734 --> 00:37:17.702
I finally found somewhere
that I'm good at,

967
00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:19.074
where I'm valued!

968
00:37:19.237 --> 00:37:20.317
You want to criticize that?

969
00:37:20.488 --> 00:37:23.412
What I was saying is that
it's just a little weird

970
00:37:23.491 --> 00:37:24.834
for a grown man to be helping

971
00:37:24.909 --> 00:37:26.252
a bunch of girls
make a sorority.

972
00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:27.555
Doesn't that sound crazy to you?

973
00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:30.139
No... Did you know that sororities
don't have the right to party?

974
00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:32.258
You know, there's no
legal right to party.

975
00:37:32.333 --> 00:37:34.006
Yes, there is a legal
right to party...

976
00:37:34.169 --> 00:37:35.796
Garf! Back me up, Garf.

977
00:37:35.962 --> 00:37:37.022
Man, just leave me out of it.

978
00:37:37.046 --> 00:37:38.047
Okay.

979
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:40.359
Look, I'm your best friend.
I'm just trying to be honest.

980
00:37:40.383 --> 00:37:41.430
Oh, yeah?

981
00:37:41.509 --> 00:37:42.601
Well, took you long enough.

982
00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:44.004
What's that supposed to mean?

983
00:37:44.179 --> 00:37:45.897
You didn't tell me
your biggest secret

984
00:37:45.972 --> 00:37:47.690
through all of college, man!

985
00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:50.435
Where is this even
coming from right now?

986
00:37:50.518 --> 00:37:52.691
You told Garf first!

987
00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.735
He was bi-curious
most of sophomore year.

988
00:37:54.814 --> 00:37:56.236
He was the logical
person to tell!

989
00:37:56.316 --> 00:37:57.693
Sometimes you gotta suck a dick

990
00:37:57.776 --> 00:37:59.296
to realize you
don't like sucking dick.

991
00:38:00.528 --> 00:38:02.701
You're just mad
because you're fucking lost.

992
00:38:02.864 --> 00:38:05.037
The rest of us,
we've moved forward.

993
00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.328
Garf's a cop, Scoonie's
got his own business,

994
00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:08.912
I'm getting married.

995
00:38:09.037 --> 00:38:10.880
And you're moving
into a fucking sorority.

996
00:38:15.752 --> 00:38:16.799
You know what?

997
00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:19.848
Those sisters are better brothers
to me than you ever were.

998
00:38:20.548 --> 00:38:21.595
You're not my brother.

999
00:38:22.050 --> 00:38:24.269
Don't say shit
you can't take back.

1000
00:38:24.552 --> 00:38:26.896
Bros before hoes.

1001
00:38:27.222 --> 00:38:28.724
Don't call them hoes.

1002
00:38:29.182 --> 00:38:30.934
That's not cool anymore.

1003
00:38:36.022 --> 00:38:37.990
All right, ladies,
we gotta talk finances.

1004
00:38:38.066 --> 00:38:39.534
Okay, it's really serious.

1005
00:38:39.609 --> 00:38:41.532
The fumigation took
so much of our money

1006
00:38:41.611 --> 00:38:42.922
that we're down to
two money buckets.

1007
00:38:42.946 --> 00:38:44.423
And I don't know what
we're gonna do about it.

1008
00:38:44.447 --> 00:38:46.575
Okay. What if we use our
Minions to make us money?

1009
00:38:46.658 --> 00:38:48.660
Oh, no. Their plates are
full cleaning the house.

1010
00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.541
Ahhh!

1011
00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:56.501
Maranda.

1012
00:38:56.668 --> 00:38:59.512
Doesn't your brother sell weed
on some farm outside of town?

1013
00:38:59.671 --> 00:39:01.014
Yeah, I did say that.

1014
00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:02.173
My brother, Daffodil.

1015
00:39:02.257 --> 00:39:05.602
Why don't we spend all of our
bucket money on Daffodil's weed

1016
00:39:05.677 --> 00:39:07.429
and sell it at
the tailgate this weekend?

1017
00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:09.063
Holy shit!
Fuck, yeah!

1018
00:39:09.222 --> 00:39:11.691
We can make it
rain on them hoes!

1019
00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.352
I love that idea!
We can make T-shirts

1020
00:39:13.434 --> 00:39:14.902
with glitter glue.
Kappa Nu.

1021
00:39:14.978 --> 00:39:16.776
- It's not a good idea.
- I like it.

1022
00:39:16.855 --> 00:39:18.698
It won't make enough money.
Excuse me?

1023
00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:20.334
Everyone at the tailgate's
gonna be selling weed.

1024
00:39:20.358 --> 00:39:21.359
I got it.

1025
00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:23.490
We're gonna corner
the market on weed

1026
00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:26.494
by ratting out every other
drug dealer in town.

1027
00:39:26.656 --> 00:39:28.624
That way Kappa Nu

1028
00:39:28.867 --> 00:39:31.996
is the only group selling
weed at the tailgate.

1029
00:39:32.078 --> 00:39:33.330
Fuck yes!

1030
00:39:33.413 --> 00:39:35.882
F you guys!
That shit's brilliant!

1031
00:39:35.957 --> 00:39:38.881
Guys, guys...
Guys, this is really risky.

1032
00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.187
- We gonna sell...
- Weed!

1033
00:39:40.211 --> 00:39:41.811
- We gonna smoke...
- Weed!

1034
00:39:41.921 --> 00:39:42.922
What we gonna sell?

1035
00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.048
Weed!

1036
00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:46.681
God damn it! God damn it!
God damn it!

1037
00:39:46.926 --> 00:39:49.429
You're acting like children.
You need to listen to me.

1038
00:39:49.637 --> 00:39:52.265
I've been down this road.
I know what I'm doing.

1039
00:39:52.515 --> 00:39:55.035
And I have some wisdom- And I feel
like I'm protecting you guys.

1040
00:40:18.166 --> 00:40:19.167
Am I right?

1041
00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.720
Teddy. We just voted and we've
decided it's best for you if you go.

1042
00:40:23.254 --> 00:40:24.255
When?

1043
00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:25.632
Just now.

1044
00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:26.807
With our phones.

1045
00:40:26.966 --> 00:40:28.092
What? No.

1046
00:40:28.176 --> 00:40:29.177
No.

1047
00:40:29.260 --> 00:40:30.762
No, you can't do this to me!

1048
00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.597
I thought we were sisters.

1049
00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.307
We were supposed to be a team.

1050
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.358
Why is this happening?
You can't do this to me!

1051
00:40:36.601 --> 00:40:38.274
I quit my job!

1052
00:40:38.561 --> 00:40:40.063
Well, we didn't
tell you to do that.

1053
00:40:40.229 --> 00:40:42.106
I liquidated my 401 K for this.

1054
00:40:42.273 --> 00:40:43.399
What's a 401 K?

1055
00:40:43.566 --> 00:40:45.068
I don't know, now!

1056
00:40:45.193 --> 00:40:46.633
Look, I'm so happy
that you helped us

1057
00:40:46.736 --> 00:40:48.158
get to this place that we're in.

1058
00:40:48.237 --> 00:40:51.582
You really let us spread our
wings and fly as women.

1059
00:40:51.866 --> 00:40:52.913
This is all I have!

1060
00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:54.627
I thought we were
in this together.

1061
00:40:54.869 --> 00:40:57.213
You're not like us, dude.

1062
00:40:57.747 --> 00:40:59.294
You're an old person.

1063
00:41:03.211 --> 00:41:04.258
No, you're right.

1064
00:41:05.546 --> 00:41:07.298
I've been playing
for the wrong team.

1065
00:41:09.926 --> 00:41:11.473
I'll be seeing you around.

1066
00:41:12.053 --> 00:41:13.646
Okay.

1067
00:41:17.642 --> 00:41:21.272
I wasn't, like, too
harsh on him, was I?

1068
00:41:21.437 --> 00:41:24.611
No, no. You were fine.
You were great. You were good.

1069
00:41:27.110 --> 00:41:28.111
It's fine.

1070
00:41:28.695 --> 00:41:31.198
Well, now that Daddy's gone,

1071
00:41:31.489 --> 00:41:33.537
time to get feisty.

1072
00:41:36.995 --> 00:41:39.248
Hello? 9-1-1?

1073
00:41:39.414 --> 00:41:41.416
I need to report
three different addresses

1074
00:41:41.541 --> 00:41:43.509
that are currently
selling marijuana.

1075
00:41:43.668 --> 00:41:45.386
Yes, ganja.

1076
00:41:45.962 --> 00:41:49.307
Get on the fucking ground!

1077
00:41:49.465 --> 00:41:50.717
Put it in your mouth!

1078
00:41:50.883 --> 00:41:52.180
Yeah, you like it, don't you?

1079
00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:53.570
Watkins, what are
you doing, man?

1080
00:41:53.594 --> 00:41:55.517
This is your training day!
What's training day?

1081
00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.057
This is your training day!

1082
00:41:57.432 --> 00:41:58.649
Get down!

1083
00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:04.321
You're not in
the Academy anymore, private.

1084
00:42:06.274 --> 00:42:07.617
Oh, sorry.

1085
00:42:07.692 --> 00:42:10.866
Oh. You guys gotta come
to the precinct with us.

1086
00:42:11.029 --> 00:42:12.872
You ride in the car.
We got bottled water.

1087
00:42:13.031 --> 00:42:15.284
We'll stop at P.F. Chang's,
Chipotle, whatever you need.

1088
00:42:15.491 --> 00:42:17.789
Passing that mold
inspection was a miracle!

1089
00:42:18.119 --> 00:42:19.746
Praise be.
Yeah. No shit.

1090
00:42:19.912 --> 00:42:23.633
If they drive past here and
they see the girls, it's over.

1091
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:25.436
The worst part of
this whole fucking thing,

1092
00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.895
I'm so stressed out,
all I want to do

1093
00:42:26.919 --> 00:42:28.216
is chill out and smoke a joint,

1094
00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:30.499
and my dealer doesn't have any weed.
He's fucking dry!

1095
00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:31.668
Good luck finding any.

1096
00:42:31.758 --> 00:42:33.110
- Jesus Christ, man!
- Whoa!

1097
00:42:33.134 --> 00:42:34.511
How the fuck did
you get in here?

1098
00:42:34.677 --> 00:42:35.917
None of that matters right now.

1099
00:42:36.054 --> 00:42:38.615
I want to help you guys stop that
sorority before it gets too late.

1100
00:42:38.639 --> 00:42:39.640
Really?

1101
00:42:39.807 --> 00:42:40.933
That's right.

1102
00:42:41.059 --> 00:42:42.060
I'm switching sides.

1103
00:42:42.769 --> 00:42:44.612
Nice! That's awesome! Cool!
Yes!

1104
00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:46.899
FYI, Kelly, I'm still down.

1105
00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.817
Stop it.

1106
00:42:49.317 --> 00:42:50.677
Okay. I know
you're not gonna fuck.

1107
00:42:50.735 --> 00:42:52.032
It still hurts my feelings.

1108
00:42:52.111 --> 00:42:53.784
He's just having a joke.

1109
00:42:53.946 --> 00:42:55.823
Kappa Nu has cornered
the market on weed.

1110
00:42:55.990 --> 00:42:57.082
Oh, no!
Oh, God.

1111
00:42:57.241 --> 00:42:58.242
Oh, yes!

1112
00:42:58.409 --> 00:42:59.970
Until Monday, they are
the only purveyors

1113
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:01.496
of weed in the greater
Ardendale area.

1114
00:43:01.662 --> 00:43:03.474
Holy shit! Do you think they'll
sell me some? Oh, my God-

1115
00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:05.375
No.
Fuck!

1116
00:43:05.458 --> 00:43:06.926
They have seven pounds of weed.

1117
00:43:07.001 --> 00:43:08.969
They can sell it for $50
a gram if they want to.

1118
00:43:09.045 --> 00:43:10.513
That's over $1,000 an ounce,

1119
00:43:10.588 --> 00:43:12.056
$16,000 a pound.

1120
00:43:12.131 --> 00:43:16.102
All said and done, if they move
it all, that's over $112,000.

1121
00:43:16.260 --> 00:43:17.728
Dude.
We should do this.

1122
00:43:17.804 --> 00:43:19.272
You're incredible at math.

1123
00:43:19.347 --> 00:43:21.270
Nah, I suck at math.
I'm good at weed.

1124
00:43:21.432 --> 00:43:22.433
It's the same thing.

1125
00:43:22.558 --> 00:43:24.185
No, this is weed.

1126
00:43:24.435 --> 00:43:26.413
Just pretend it's seven
pounds of meat, just try it.

1127
00:43:26.437 --> 00:43:27.939
Why would I even be buying meat?

1128
00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:29.232
I don't know.
You're hungry.

1129
00:43:29.398 --> 00:43:30.695
Are you talking burgers?

1130
00:43:30.775 --> 00:43:31.776
Steaks.

1131
00:43:31.943 --> 00:43:33.570
How much does a gram
of steak go for?

1132
00:43:33.736 --> 00:43:35.776
I don't know. Why would I
be selling grams of steak?

1133
00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:37.119
Fair enough.

1134
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:39.158
Their plan is to sell
the weed at the tailgate.

1135
00:43:39.283 --> 00:43:41.001
And believe me,
that's enough for them

1136
00:43:41.077 --> 00:43:42.221
to stay in the house
through your escrow.

1137
00:43:42.245 --> 00:43:43.667
God.
What do we do?

1138
00:43:43.830 --> 00:43:46.150
If we steal their weed, they
won't be able to pay the rent.

1139
00:43:46.249 --> 00:43:47.726
All of the members
that they've recruited

1140
00:43:47.750 --> 00:43:49.127
will have to rush
other sororities,

1141
00:43:49.210 --> 00:43:50.211
and that will be that.

1142
00:43:50.378 --> 00:43:51.647
What's in this for you, bro?
Yeah.

1143
00:43:51.671 --> 00:43:54.424
Honestly, I just
want to be valued.

1144
00:43:54.590 --> 00:43:55.682
Well, it begs the question.

1145
00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:58.198
How the fuck are we supposed to beat them?
There's 15 of them!

1146
00:43:58.261 --> 00:44:00.480
No, they have 15 individuals.
RIPPED BY ELAJOHN

1147
00:44:00.638 --> 00:44:02.356
They're not a cohesive unit.

1148
00:44:02.515 --> 00:44:05.359
They don't understand the most
important rule of sisterhood.

1149
00:44:05.518 --> 00:44:07.395
There's no "I" in sorority.

1150
00:44:07.562 --> 00:44:09.064
Yeah, there is.
There's two actually.

1151
00:44:09.230 --> 00:44:10.322
Actually, there's just one.

1152
00:44:10.439 --> 00:44:11.611
No, that's a "Y."

1153
00:44:11.774 --> 00:44:13.242
No, in the middle.
That's an

1154
00:44:13.401 --> 00:44:15.449
Two "I"s, straddling the "Y".

1155
00:44:15.611 --> 00:44:19.036
S-O-R-R-I-A-Y-O-R-I-T-Y.

1156
00:44:19.365 --> 00:44:20.366
What?

1157
00:44:20.449 --> 00:44:22.344
There's a "U" in there that
you guys are all missing.

1158
00:44:22.368 --> 00:44:27.920
S-O-R-R-I-R-O-I-T-I-T-Y.

1159
00:44:28.082 --> 00:44:30.176
Sorriroi-tity? KELLY:
That's how you spell it.

1160
00:44:30.334 --> 00:44:31.478
You think the "tity" is silent?

1161
00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.302
Look, we're all getting
sidetracked right now!

1162
00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:34.843
Guys, bottom line is

1163
00:44:35.006 --> 00:44:37.555
we need to figure out a way
to infiltrate that tailgate.

1164
00:44:37.967 --> 00:44:39.093
Tailgate?

1165
00:44:39.343 --> 00:44:40.344
Tailgate.

1166
00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:42.848
Tailgate.

1167
00:44:44.223 --> 00:44:45.224
Tailgate! Tailgate!

1168
00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:22.011
High pie!

1169
00:45:22.178 --> 00:45:24.556
Yes, you.
Come on! Pot pie!

1170
00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:27.396
Weed for women!
It's only 20 bucks!

1171
00:45:27.558 --> 00:45:29.652
Kappa Nu weed.
It's charity weed.

1172
00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:30.936
High pie.

1173
00:45:31.062 --> 00:45:32.289
Come on!
It's just $20 a slice!

1174
00:45:32.313 --> 00:45:34.315
Come get your pie!
Pot pie, guys!

1175
00:45:36.484 --> 00:45:38.612
First off, you look
fucking horrifying.

1176
00:45:38.736 --> 00:45:40.579
What? It's a clown, man.
People love clowns.

1177
00:45:40.821 --> 00:45:42.869
Jesus fucking Christ!

1178
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:43.991
Stop doing that!

1179
00:45:44.158 --> 00:45:45.918
Don't do that again.
Okay? I will give birth.

1180
00:45:45.993 --> 00:45:47.791
Guys, listen!
Here's the plan.

1181
00:45:47.954 --> 00:45:50.628
I'm gonna get up on stage
and I'm gonna dance,

1182
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.963
distracting the girls
just long enough for Mac

1183
00:45:53.042 --> 00:45:54.794
to run around
and steal the weed.

1184
00:45:54.961 --> 00:45:57.430
Kelly, Paula, I need you
both to drive getaway.

1185
00:45:57.505 --> 00:45:59.865
I can't have you running around
here 'cause you're pregnant.

1186
00:46:00.174 --> 00:46:02.176
Wait, just you dancing is enough

1187
00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:03.637
to distract the entire sorority?

1188
00:46:03.719 --> 00:46:04.720
I don't know about that.

1189
00:46:04.845 --> 00:46:06.518
That'll work.
It usually works.

1190
00:46:06.681 --> 00:46:08.200
I don't even know
where we are right now.

1191
00:46:08.224 --> 00:46:09.271
Okay.

1192
00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:10.351
I'm ready.
All right.

1193
00:46:12.144 --> 00:46:13.566
Oh, shit! Fuck!

1194
00:46:13.813 --> 00:46:14.985
What's wrong?
Damn it.

1195
00:46:15.314 --> 00:46:17.191
No! I don't have
the baby oil.

1196
00:46:17.316 --> 00:46:18.317
What's the big deal?

1197
00:46:18.401 --> 00:46:19.544
No, it's the most
important thing!

1198
00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:21.570
With baby oil, you get,
like, two extra lines here.

1199
00:46:21.654 --> 00:46:22.654
Really?

1200
00:46:22.697 --> 00:46:24.217
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
God damn it-

1201
00:46:25.533 --> 00:46:26.580
All right, let's go!

1202
00:46:26.993 --> 00:46:28.415
Ooh, that's hot!

1203
00:46:28.577 --> 00:46:30.671
Oh, that's really hot!
Ow! It burns!

1204
00:46:30.746 --> 00:46:31.747
Rub that shit in.

1205
00:46:31.872 --> 00:46:34.375
All right, rub it in.
Rub it in.

1206
00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:35.459
Jeez.

1207
00:46:35.543 --> 00:46:36.760
Oh, my God!
God bless you, kid.

1208
00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:37.883
Kelly?
What?

1209
00:46:37.962 --> 00:46:40.385
What the fuck are you doing?
We're in a rush, Mac.

1210
00:46:40.506 --> 00:46:42.224
Come on, Mac. Get his thighs.
Okay.

1211
00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.194
<i>Yo, what's up!
Clear the stage,</i>

1212
00:46:44.218 --> 00:46:45.720
clear the stage!

1213
00:46:45.886 --> 00:46:47.103
<i>I got something to say.</i>

1214
00:46:47.263 --> 00:46:49.891
<i>This song right here goes out
to my girls in Kappa Nu.</i>

1215
00:46:50.057 --> 00:46:53.061
<i>I know we've been going through
some rough times lately.</i>

1216
00:46:53.227 --> 00:46:54.427
<i>But I love you.</i>

1217
00:46:55.855 --> 00:46:57.072
<i>DJ, let's shake that booty.</i>

1218
00:46:57.231 --> 00:46:58.403
You got this, right, Beth?

1219
00:46:58.566 --> 00:46:59.806
Yes, I got this.
I'm right here.

1220
00:47:34.018 --> 00:47:35.019
Fuck!

1221
00:47:50.951 --> 00:47:52.669
No! He showed dick!

1222
00:47:54.663 --> 00:47:55.710
Oh, no!

1223
00:47:55.873 --> 00:47:57.546
The weed!
Oh, shit!

1224
00:47:57.708 --> 00:47:58.709
It's all gone!

1225
00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:01.470
Oh, my God! It's all gone!
It's all gone!

1226
00:48:02.296 --> 00:48:04.469
Chester the fucking
Cheetah took our weed!

1227
00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:06.035
Get the fucking bag of weed!

1228
00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:08.643
Get the weed!

1229
00:48:11.347 --> 00:48:12.974
God, I hate clowns!

1230
00:48:13.099 --> 00:48:14.316
Get out of the way!

1231
00:48:15.684 --> 00:48:17.812
Get another exit.
Find the exit!

1232
00:48:17.895 --> 00:48:19.215
I'm blocked!
I'll get another car!

1233
00:48:19.397 --> 00:48:21.024
Go! Go!
Oh, No!

1234
00:48:35.746 --> 00:48:37.043
Move, move, move!

1235
00:48:37.289 --> 00:48:39.007
Fuck!

1236
00:48:39.083 --> 00:48:40.255
Get out of the way!

1237
00:48:47.216 --> 00:48:48.684
I got your weed!

1238
00:48:49.009 --> 00:48:50.010
Move!

1239
00:48:50.678 --> 00:48:52.271
Which one is it?
Where's the weed?

1240
00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.840
Give me the fucking weed!

1241
00:49:01.939 --> 00:49:03.191
Who's laughing now, clown?

1242
00:49:03.524 --> 00:49:04.644
Who's laughing now?
Ow! Stop!

1243
00:49:05.943 --> 00:49:07.945
It's garbage!
It's not weed!

1244
00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:09.113
Oh, fuck!

1245
00:49:09.196 --> 00:49:10.413
The weed! The weed!

1246
00:49:11.574 --> 00:49:12.621
Go for it!

1247
00:49:14.326 --> 00:49:15.418
Oh, shit!

1248
00:49:16.203 --> 00:49:17.921
Okay, wait! Mac,

1249
00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:20.549
you can do this.

1250
00:49:27.548 --> 00:49:29.221
4-20!

1251
00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:36.140
Oh, fuck!

1252
00:49:48.068 --> 00:49:49.320
On your right!
Take it!

1253
00:49:49.403 --> 00:49:51.701
I'm All-State track
and field, bitch!

1254
00:50:17.348 --> 00:50:18.349
Come on!

1255
00:50:20.434 --> 00:50:21.606
Come on!

1256
00:50:21.685 --> 00:50:22.937
Hurry!

1257
00:50:27.316 --> 00:50:28.317
On, shit!

1258
00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:29.443
Here she comes!

1259
00:50:30.611 --> 00:50:33.114
Free weed! Take it! Free weed!
Weed for everyone!

1260
00:50:33.614 --> 00:50:34.661
Free weed!
Free weed!

1261
00:50:38.953 --> 00:50:41.376
That's all our weed!
How are we gonna pay rent?

1262
00:50:42.122 --> 00:50:44.875
You're really turning me on
with your muscles right now.

1263
00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.092
Two pounds coming!

1264
00:50:46.168 --> 00:50:47.670
You look...
Are you in pain?

1265
00:50:47.753 --> 00:50:49.551
They're just a little heavy.
Yeah. Yeah.

1266
00:50:49.838 --> 00:50:51.966
<i>I</i> love you! Shit!

1267
00:50:52.132 --> 00:50:55.762
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

1268
00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:57.472
Ah!

1269
00:50:58.013 --> 00:50:59.014
Oh, fuck!

1270
00:50:59.181 --> 00:51:02.811
- This is a fucking shame, but
it's also pretty fun. - WhOO...

1271
00:51:02.977 --> 00:51:04.024
Thank you, dude.
Yeah.

1272
00:51:04.103 --> 00:51:05.946
Dude, those girls
were out of control!

1273
00:51:06.105 --> 00:51:09.735
No, those girls were out of
control until we controlled them.

1274
00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:10.961
You really controlled them.

1275
00:51:10.985 --> 00:51:12.128
You have to remind yourself that

1276
00:51:12.152 --> 00:51:14.120
any situation is
actually controllable

1277
00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:18.410
because parents are smart and kids,
by comparison, are fucking stupid.

1278
00:51:18.576 --> 00:51:20.544
You have it figured out.
You can't do anything

1279
00:51:20.703 --> 00:51:23.798
until you know the answer
to one simple question.

1280
00:51:23.956 --> 00:51:25.629
"Who is Teddy Sanders?"
Mmm.

1281
00:51:25.791 --> 00:51:27.631
It's a very important
question to ask yourself.

1282
00:51:27.668 --> 00:51:30.638
Before I got anywhere
in life, I asked myself,

1283
00:51:30.796 --> 00:51:32.048
"Who is Mac Radner?"

1284
00:51:32.214 --> 00:51:34.012
And I said, "Who are
you, Kelly Dhundee?"

1285
00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.318
Your maiden name's Dundee?

1286
00:51:35.342 --> 00:51:37.219
No, it's got an Dhundee.

1287
00:51:37.344 --> 00:51:38.345
<i>Like Crocodile Dundee?</i>

1288
00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:40.514
It's "Dhundee." It's a
different name altogether.

1289
00:51:40.681 --> 00:51:42.909
I know it's a different name,
but it's just a coincidence.

1290
00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:43.934
<i>Crocodile Dundee.</i>

1291
00:51:44.018 --> 00:51:45.395
It's nothing like it!

1292
00:51:45.561 --> 00:51:47.108
No. Nothing like that.

1293
00:51:47.187 --> 00:51:49.781
But anyway, that's what you need to know.
Who is Teddy Sanders?

1294
00:51:49.982 --> 00:51:51.209
Buddy, what are you doing today?

1295
00:51:51.233 --> 00:51:52.405
Yeah, what's your...

1296
00:51:52.484 --> 00:51:54.202
What your overall
game plan here?

1297
00:51:54.361 --> 00:51:55.533
Just in life.

1298
00:51:55.696 --> 00:51:58.825
I'll probably play
some games on my phone,

1299
00:51:58.991 --> 00:52:02.040
and walk around for a little
bit until I tire myself out,

1300
00:52:02.202 --> 00:52:04.296
then go to sleep in my car.

1301
00:52:04.872 --> 00:52:06.124
Probably.

1302
00:52:06.999 --> 00:52:08.216
So sad.

1303
00:52:09.209 --> 00:52:12.213
Um, do you wanna
maybe crash here?

1304
00:52:12.630 --> 00:52:14.303
Really, I won't
take up too much room?

1305
00:52:14.381 --> 00:52:15.661
You could sleep
in Stella's room.

1306
00:52:15.758 --> 00:52:18.056
She takes up this much space.

1307
00:52:18.218 --> 00:52:19.344
Yeah.

1308
00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:24.433
Thank you, guys-

1309
00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:25.726
No, thank you.

1310
00:52:26.185 --> 00:52:27.311
It means a lot to me.

1311
00:52:27.394 --> 00:52:29.442
I can see that. It's
not that big a deal.

1312
00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:31.364
No, it is a big deal.

1313
00:52:32.858 --> 00:52:33.905
Thank you.
Okay.

1314
00:52:36.111 --> 00:52:37.533
Thank you.

1315
00:52:37.696 --> 00:52:39.257
Do you have any more of these?

1316
00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:41.625
Yes, there's heaps in the kitchen.
Help yourself.

1317
00:52:41.784 --> 00:52:42.956
Are they baby food?

1318
00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:44.249
Technically.

1319
00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:46.209
- Babies eat good food.
- Yeah.

1320
00:52:46.372 --> 00:52:47.589
This is awesome.

1321
00:52:47.748 --> 00:52:48.965
Go get them.

1322
00:52:54.588 --> 00:52:56.886
That's cute.
Look at him.

1323
00:52:58.300 --> 00:53:01.395
He inhaled so much weed smoke
he tuckered himself out.

1324
00:53:03.305 --> 00:53:04.682
All right.

1325
00:53:07.101 --> 00:53:08.853
Guys, we lost our nest egg.

1326
00:53:09.019 --> 00:53:10.987
We lost all of our weed
and our rent is due.

1327
00:53:11.063 --> 00:53:12.189
What are we supposed to do?

1328
00:53:12.272 --> 00:53:13.416
Beth, what happened?
I thought you were the one

1329
00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.709
stopping the old people
from getting the weed.

1330
00:53:14.733 --> 00:53:16.280
No! Do not blame me!

1331
00:53:16.443 --> 00:53:17.843
You saw what was
happening up there.

1332
00:53:17.903 --> 00:53:20.452
I am a human woman.
I had to watch that.

1333
00:53:20.656 --> 00:53:22.456
I was on the whipped cream.
You were on the...

1334
00:53:22.491 --> 00:53:23.635
We watch things together...

1335
00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:26.128
She was in charge of the weed.
You were in charge of the weed.

1336
00:53:26.286 --> 00:53:28.380
No, no! Stop it!

1337
00:53:28.539 --> 00:53:30.099
Stop it, don't you
see what's happening?

1338
00:53:30.791 --> 00:53:32.394
This is what the old
people want us to do.

1339
00:53:32.418 --> 00:53:33.965
They wanna tear us apart.

1340
00:53:34.211 --> 00:53:37.465
They know that if we're a
united front, we can't lose.

1341
00:53:37.548 --> 00:53:39.300
Because we are sisters.

1342
00:53:39.466 --> 00:53:40.694
And for the first
time in my life,

1343
00:53:40.718 --> 00:53:41.945
I feel like I belong right now.

1344
00:53:41.969 --> 00:53:44.392
This is so much better than I
ever thought college could be.

1345
00:53:44.555 --> 00:53:48.276
This is the most fun I've ever
had and I went to space camp.

1346
00:53:48.434 --> 00:53:49.811
I haven't slept in,
like, a week.

1347
00:53:49.977 --> 00:53:51.538
I just don't want to
miss out on anything.

1348
00:53:51.562 --> 00:53:52.654
You guys are so much fun.

1349
00:53:52.813 --> 00:53:54.440
We're never gonna
lose each other.

1350
00:53:54.606 --> 00:53:56.859
I mean, what do you call a
house full of united women?

1351
00:53:57.317 --> 00:53:58.318
A brothel.

1352
00:53:58.402 --> 00:53:59.870
No, man.

1353
00:53:59.945 --> 00:54:01.071
A sorority.

1354
00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:02.656
Oh...

1355
00:54:02.823 --> 00:54:04.666
Okay. This is the problem.

1356
00:54:04.992 --> 00:54:06.261
We're never gonna
solve our money issues

1357
00:54:06.285 --> 00:54:07.965
when we're in this
war with the old people.

1358
00:54:07.995 --> 00:54:09.681
What can we do? We're
gonna give the old people

1359
00:54:09.705 --> 00:54:11.141
a taste of their own
medicine. All right?

1360
00:54:11.165 --> 00:54:13.167
They tried to tear us apart.
Yeah.

1361
00:54:13.333 --> 00:54:15.335
So, what are we gonna do?

1362
00:54:17.045 --> 00:54:18.165
We're gonna tear them apart!

1363
00:54:18.255 --> 00:54:19.347
Yeah.

1364
00:54:19.673 --> 00:54:22.096
I mean, unless you guys think
that's too intense of a plan.

1365
00:54:22.176 --> 00:54:26.397
Shelby, they would never say you
were too intense if you were a man.

1366
00:54:26.889 --> 00:54:29.392
Yeah, own that shit, queen. Yeah.

1367
00:54:29.558 --> 00:54:32.653
Let's do this,
team! Yeah!

1368
00:54:35.773 --> 00:54:37.320
Ah. What do
we think of that?

1369
00:54:38.317 --> 00:54:40.695
"Oh, my prince, come for me!

1370
00:54:41.403 --> 00:54:42.404
"Come for me."

1371
00:54:42.488 --> 00:54:44.608
"No, I won't.
I'm not coming for you."

1372
00:54:44.823 --> 00:54:46.791
Yellow stars.

1373
00:54:47.493 --> 00:54:49.040
What color for
her dress? Mmm?

1374
00:54:51.371 --> 00:54:52.714
What is the water doing?

1375
00:54:52.873 --> 00:54:53.999
It's boiling.

1376
00:54:54.166 --> 00:54:56.544
Pretty cool, huh?
What we do now,

1377
00:54:56.710 --> 00:54:58.883
we're gonna add
the eggs to it. Okay?

1378
00:54:59.046 --> 00:55:00.566
You put eggs in the water?
Yeah. Watch.

1379
00:55:01.882 --> 00:55:03.429
- Did you hear that?
- Ah!

1380
00:55:03.592 --> 00:55:04.593
It's hot!

1381
00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:06.362
Oh, dude, don't fucking touch it!
I told you it's hot!

1382
00:55:06.386 --> 00:55:09.014
Oh, my gosh! I thought
it was like Jacuzzi hot.

1383
00:55:09.181 --> 00:55:11.058
- No, it's boiling hot!
- Oh.

1384
00:55:11.308 --> 00:55:14.107
Now, we add the eggs, and
we hard-boil them, okay?

1385
00:55:14.269 --> 00:55:16.271
Don't put the eggs in there.
It's gonna melt them.

1386
00:55:16.355 --> 00:55:19.029
No, it hard-boils them.
It makes them hard.

1387
00:55:19.191 --> 00:55:20.738
Why would it make eggs hard?

1388
00:55:20.901 --> 00:55:22.781
What do you mean, "Why
would it make eggs hard?"

1389
00:55:22.861 --> 00:55:24.704
It makes pasta soft-.

1390
00:55:25.614 --> 00:55:26.615
Whoa.

1391
00:55:26.907 --> 00:55:28.079
That's a good point.

1392
00:55:29.243 --> 00:55:30.495
She looks fantastic.

1393
00:55:30.744 --> 00:55:31.745
Look at this.

1394
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:33.251
I think this is
a gorgeous color.

1395
00:55:34.915 --> 00:55:37.794
- Oh, I love coloring in.
- I love it!

1396
00:55:38.418 --> 00:55:40.261
She's quite overdressed
really, isn't she?

1397
00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:44.266
She's just in a garden
somewhere in a ball gown.

1398
00:55:44.758 --> 00:55:47.056
Do you see people sometimes
that I don't see?

1399
00:55:48.554 --> 00:55:49.976
You can tell me.

1400
00:55:50.138 --> 00:55:52.391
Honey, I'm home!

1401
00:55:52.558 --> 00:55:53.743
I've always wanted to say that.

1402
00:55:53.767 --> 00:55:55.007
It's fun.
I say it all the time.

1403
00:55:55.060 --> 00:55:56.687
Really?
Yeah.

1404
00:55:57.771 --> 00:56:00.149
<i>"Dear Mac, I know
everything seemed good between us,</i>

1405
00:56:00.232 --> 00:56:03.111
<i>"but I've been lying to you and myself.
I'm freaking out. From Kelly."</i>

1406
00:56:03.277 --> 00:56:04.277
What?

1407
00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:06.447
What's she talking about?
That's gotta be a joke.

1408
00:56:06.613 --> 00:56:08.081
She must be fucking with me.

1409
00:56:08.240 --> 00:56:09.457
Yeah, she's joking around.

1410
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:19.673
That is so fucked up.
You bad, girl!

1411
00:56:19.751 --> 00:56:21.378
Oh, yeah. It's on!

1412
00:56:21.628 --> 00:56:23.630
I'm gonna call her.
Definitely call her.

1413
00:56:23.797 --> 00:56:25.970
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck!
Fuck. He's calling.

1414
00:56:26.133 --> 00:56:27.485
Hang up, hang up.
Decline, decline-

1415
00:56:27.509 --> 00:56:28.601
What's going on right now?

1416
00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:30.933
- It's okay!
- Hang it up!

1417
00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.660
Just stay chill. Every/thing's fine.
What should I do right now?

1418
00:56:41.273 --> 00:56:42.274
Huh?

1419
00:56:58.332 --> 00:57:00.460
Where did she go?

1420
00:57:00.626 --> 00:57:02.845
I know exactly where she went.

1421
00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:04.467
What?

1422
00:57:10.844 --> 00:57:13.939
Mac, I've been up all night!
I'm worried sick!

1423
00:57:14.097 --> 00:57:17.021
Please just text me
something. I'm worried.

1424
00:57:23.023 --> 00:57:24.024
What?

1425
00:57:35.243 --> 00:57:36.460
Fucking Jimmy.

1426
00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:37.583
Let's go, I'm hungry!

1427
00:57:37.704 --> 00:57:38.864
Trying to get this tweet out.

1428
00:57:38.914 --> 00:57:40.006
How do you spell Trump?

1429
00:57:40.082 --> 00:57:41.379
Jimmy.

1430
00:57:41.541 --> 00:57:43.384
Hey, what's up, Kel?
Where is he?

1431
00:57:43.710 --> 00:57:45.383
Where's who?
You're lying to me!

1432
00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:47.681
You're a fucking terrible actor!
Tell me where he is!

1433
00:57:47.756 --> 00:57:48.848
Uh, I don't know.

1434
00:57:49.007 --> 00:57:51.110
He told me that you'd pretend
you didn't know where he was.

1435
00:57:51.134 --> 00:57:52.306
Tell me where he is!
Ow, no.

1436
00:57:52.386 --> 00:57:53.433
Hey, Kel!

1437
00:57:53.595 --> 00:57:56.098
Where is Mac? Mac is missing,
and Jimmy knows where he is.

1438
00:57:56.264 --> 00:57:58.266
Fucking tell her
where the fuck he is!

1439
00:57:58.433 --> 00:57:59.869
I was with you last night.
I don't know.

1440
00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:02.066
I know you're protecting
some stupid bro code.

1441
00:58:02.145 --> 00:58:03.522
Just tell me where he is.

1442
00:58:03.605 --> 00:58:04.707
Bro code?
No, there's no bro code.

1443
00:58:04.731 --> 00:58:06.542
He likes you more than me.
He tells me that every day.

1444
00:58:06.566 --> 00:58:08.503
You're fucking lying to me, Jimmy!
Tell me where he is!

1445
00:58:08.527 --> 00:58:09.653
I'm not lying.

1446
00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:11.416
Excuse me. Why is
there so much language...

1447
00:58:11.446 --> 00:58:12.447
This is an emergency!

1448
00:58:12.572 --> 00:58:14.842
My husband Mac has vanished, and
this man knows where he is!

1449
00:58:14.866 --> 00:58:16.243
Well, tell her!
Tell me!

1450
00:58:16.326 --> 00:58:17.578
Tell her!
Fucking tell her!

1451
00:58:17.828 --> 00:58:18.828
Whoa! Oh!

1452
00:58:18.912 --> 00:58:20.272
You don't have to do that.
Tell me!

1453
00:58:23.542 --> 00:58:25.419
He's in jail for child porn!

1454
00:58:25.544 --> 00:58:27.888
What? No! I'm lying! I
don't know where he is!

1455
00:58:27.963 --> 00:58:29.340
No, no, no!

1456
00:58:29.423 --> 00:58:30.566
Call him on the phone now!
Call him!

1457
00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:31.637
You deserved that, Jimmy.

1458
00:58:31.758 --> 00:58:33.931
Hold on! Hold on!
Call him!

1459
00:58:34.011 --> 00:58:35.684
Here, here.
Fuck it!

1460
00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:38.940
It broke the skin.

1461
00:58:39.099 --> 00:58:40.316
<i>Kelly?</i>

1462
00:58:40.475 --> 00:58:42.161
<i>Why do you have Jimmy's phone?
Where are you?</i>

1463
00:58:42.185 --> 00:58:43.985
<i>Are you around here? Are
you hiding somewhere?</i>

1464
00:58:44.021 --> 00:58:45.701
Where are you?
I'm in your office!

1465
00:58:45.772 --> 00:58:47.274
I've been looking for you.

1466
00:58:47.441 --> 00:58:48.543
<i>I went where you
told me to meet you!</i>

1467
00:58:48.567 --> 00:58:49.614
Where are you?

1468
00:58:49.693 --> 00:58:52.162
In Sydney, Australia!
<i>What?</i>

1469
00:58:52.237 --> 00:58:53.659
Outside the Opera House!

1470
00:58:53.864 --> 00:58:55.081
You're in Australia?

1471
00:58:55.157 --> 00:58:58.036
Yeah, I just got off a plane. I've
been on a plane for 18 hours!

1472
00:58:58.326 --> 00:58:59.452
What's happening?

1473
00:58:59.536 --> 00:59:00.583
We've been hacked!

1474
00:59:01.246 --> 00:59:03.590
"Kappa Nu fooled you."

1475
00:59:03.749 --> 00:59:04.921
Kappa Nu?

1476
00:59:05.083 --> 00:59:07.051
Prank war!
Airbags, airbags!

1477
00:59:07.127 --> 00:59:08.174
Airbags!

1478
00:59:08.295 --> 00:59:11.048
<i>Airbags! This is not</i> a <i>drill!
All butts up!</i>

1479
00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:12.966
All butts up! Go!

1480
00:59:17.179 --> 00:59:20.308
I might do the bridge walk
and then I'm gonna come home.

1481
00:59:21.266 --> 00:59:23.143
It's a barely used refrigerator.

1482
00:59:29.483 --> 00:59:31.235
"Old people shit?"

1483
00:59:38.825 --> 00:59:41.499
"Kappa Nu
steals from you."

1484
00:59:41.661 --> 00:59:42.958
They robbed us?

1485
00:59:43.038 --> 00:59:44.290
This is so fucked!

1486
00:59:44.331 --> 00:59:46.504
We should call the police!
We can't call the police!

1487
00:59:46.583 --> 00:59:48.426
We stole their weed.
We're in too deep!

1488
00:59:48.585 --> 00:59:50.508
You know what? Girls
are worse than guys!

1489
00:59:50.712 --> 00:59:51.804
I'm just gonna say it!

1490
00:59:51.922 --> 00:59:53.845
I know that's not
feminist, but fuck that!

1491
00:59:53.924 --> 00:59:55.401
At least they didn't
take Stella's toys.

1492
00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:56.486
Oh, don't give me that!

1493
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:59.104
I've been awake for four days.
I'm so tired!

1494
00:59:59.846 --> 01:00:02.224
It's 3:00 a.m.
where I am in Australia!

1495
01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.647
We are so fucked!

1496
01:00:04.726 --> 01:00:06.353
We're in a drug
war with teenagers.

1497
01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:08.539
We don't have any furniture.
We're gonna go bankrupt.

1498
01:00:08.563 --> 01:00:11.191
We made so many bad choices
throughout this process.

1499
01:00:11.274 --> 01:00:13.368
We're about to have two girls!
Two kids!

1500
01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:15.838
That's completely irresponsible of us.
We can't take care of one-

1501
01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:17.205
I know I'm not a good parent.

1502
01:00:17.364 --> 01:00:18.684
Oh, fuck that.
I'm the bad parent.

1503
01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:20.663
Now, shut it down.
No. You don't get this one!

1504
01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:22.744
I'm the bad parent!
I'm the bad parent.

1505
01:00:23.036 --> 01:00:25.664
Last week, I found her
chewing on a nugget of weed.

1506
01:00:25.747 --> 01:00:27.308
I don't know how long she
had it in her mouth for.

1507
01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:28.629
Was it the Indica or Sativa?

1508
01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:31.052
It was Indica! She slept
for, like, nine hours after.

1509
01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:32.470
I'm the bad parent.

1510
01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:33.889
When she was six months old,

1511
01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:35.181
I dropped her on her head.

1512
01:00:35.257 --> 01:00:37.225
So did I.
What?

1513
01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.769
One time, I went to Taco
Bell, I left her at home.

1514
01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:41.188
I forgot she existed.

1515
01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:42.365
She almost died over a Gordita.

1516
01:00:42.389 --> 01:00:43.891
I'm such a bad parent.

1517
01:00:44.057 --> 01:00:45.559
Well, maybe we're
both bad parents!

1518
01:00:51.898 --> 01:00:52.899
Oh, no.

1519
01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.572
It's Wendy, the realtor.

1520
01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:57.028
My clients are
backing out of escrow.

1521
01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:58.405
Yeah.
What?

1522
01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.700
We drove by the house
yesterday and saw Kappa Nu.

1523
01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:02.218
How do you know
the name of the sorority?

1524
01:01:02.242 --> 01:01:03.585
I went to college,
too, you know.

1525
01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:05.871
Omega Theta.
Let's roll out!

1526
01:01:06.037 --> 01:01:07.163
Why the hell is he here?

1527
01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:08.669
I thought you were my clients.

1528
01:01:08.748 --> 01:01:10.921
We hired him because you
just forgot to mention

1529
01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:13.925
the sorority that lives next to
our new house, so that's why.

1530
01:01:14.004 --> 01:01:16.098
Okay. Well, congratulations
because you hired a joke.

1531
01:01:16.339 --> 01:01:17.556
Oh, shove it, Wendy.

1532
01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:18.901
Oh, shove it right
back at ya, Oliver!

1533
01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:21.098
Why don't you shove it?
Shove it right back at ya!

1534
01:01:21.178 --> 01:01:22.771
We fucked once.

1535
01:01:22.971 --> 01:01:24.097
Not applicable.

1536
01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.899
I just feel like
we're escrowing apart

1537
01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.689
and we should be
escrowing together.

1538
01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:29.537
Exactly, guys. Can we just
escrow together for a minute?

1539
01:01:29.561 --> 01:01:31.081
And the truth is,
they're lovely girls.

1540
01:01:31.188 --> 01:01:33.361
Lovely girls. Super nice girls.
We promise you.

1541
01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.520
I don't think that they are

1542
01:01:34.566 --> 01:01:36.785
because we literally saw
them robbing your house.

1543
01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:39.033
Well, thanks for
fucking stopping them!

1544
01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.923
You just stood there while
they robbed our house?

1545
01:01:40.947 --> 01:01:42.119
It wasn't like that.

1546
01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.618
You didn't tell us
about the sorority!

1547
01:01:44.784 --> 01:01:47.207
Is there anything we can do?
We're desperate!

1548
01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:50.057
Yeah, you can magically make the
sorority that lives next door to you

1549
01:01:50.081 --> 01:01:51.128
disappear by tomorrow.

1550
01:01:53.710 --> 01:01:54.711
Is it real?

1551
01:01:54.794 --> 01:01:57.217
No! Maybe it's just the old
people messing with us.

1552
01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.317
No. It's a real eviction notice.
I called the landlord-

1553
01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:00.776
Okay, maybe the landlord
<i>was</i> just one of

1554
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.560
the old people pretending
to be the landlord.

1555
01:02:02.594 --> 01:02:04.141
No. We're actually
being evicted, okay?

1556
01:02:04.221 --> 01:02:05.768
We have no money to pay for it,

1557
01:02:05.847 --> 01:02:07.770
because we spent all of
our money on the weed.

1558
01:02:07.849 --> 01:02:10.443
So now we need
five buckets of money

1559
01:02:10.518 --> 01:02:12.771
otherwise, we're gonna
get kicked out tomorrow.

1560
01:02:13.146 --> 01:02:14.999
We're gonna lose the house.
We're gonna lose the house?

1561
01:02:15.023 --> 01:02:17.752
We're gonna lose our sisters, 'cause
we're gonna be put in separate dorms.

1562
01:02:17.776 --> 01:02:18.961
Then we're gonna
have no friends anymore,

1563
01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.158
and it's gonna be just like
high school all over again.

1564
01:02:21.363 --> 01:02:23.424
What are we gonna do? I mean,
how do frats make money?

1565
01:02:23.448 --> 01:02:25.542
They throw parties and
they charge for them.

1566
01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.740
But no one's gonna pay money
to come to our parties.

1567
01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:29.847
Yeah, it's not like a frat
bro is gonna walk up and be like,

1568
01:02:29.871 --> 01:02:31.591
"Ooh, you look good
in your normal clothes."

1569
01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:32.791
Wait!

1570
01:02:32.874 --> 01:02:33.966
"I love your sweater!"

1571
01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.214
Girls, I have an idea.

1572
01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:36.503
Okay.

1573
01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:38.843
You're not going
to like it though.

1574
01:02:39.297 --> 01:02:40.469
We have to throw a party.

1575
01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:42.550
No. When we throw
parties we lose money.

1576
01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:44.511
No, not one of our
really fun parties

1577
01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.434
that we actually
have a good time at.

1578
01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:47.856
I mean it's, like, empowering.

1579
01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:49.992
We have to throw a really
shitty frat brother party.

1580
01:02:50.016 --> 01:02:51.768
One where the frat
brothers like it so much,

1581
01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:53.645
they actually pay us to come to.

1582
01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:55.164
And then they really
like it so much, they tell

1583
01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:57.566
all their other
douchy frat brother friends

1584
01:02:57.649 --> 01:02:58.901
and they all pay us, too.

1585
01:02:58.984 --> 01:03:00.327
Like the one we
met each other at?

1586
01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:02.320
The other option here
is losing the house,

1587
01:03:02.445 --> 01:03:04.163
and if we lose the house
we lose Kappa Nu.

1588
01:03:04.364 --> 01:03:06.162
I'm not gonna lose you guys.

1589
01:03:06.574 --> 01:03:07.791
- Okay.
- All right.

1590
01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:09.335
- Let's go tell the girls.
- Okay.

1591
01:03:09.494 --> 01:03:10.962
We don't want to
lose this sorority.

1592
01:03:11.037 --> 01:03:12.960
We don't want to
lose our house, okay?

1593
01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:14.712
That's why we gotta

1594
01:03:15.583 --> 01:03:18.336
dress a little "hotter
than we usually do."

1595
01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:19.504
I'm hot!

1596
01:03:19.587 --> 01:03:20.884
I fucked the pizza man.

1597
01:03:21.047 --> 01:03:23.049
I gave him five <i>stars</i> on Yelp.

1598
01:03:23.216 --> 01:03:24.433
You have chips in your hair.

1599
01:03:25.468 --> 01:03:26.469
Yeah.

1600
01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:46.757
Look at the production
value on this video.

1601
01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:49.910
We are totally fucked!
We're gonna be bankrupt!

1602
01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:51.919
No, no, no!
Look closer.

1603
01:03:52.078 --> 01:03:53.170
They've lost their way.

1604
01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.544
They've become everything
that they've hated.

1605
01:03:56.541 --> 01:03:58.669
- Jesus Christ.
- They're vulnerable.

1606
01:03:58.752 --> 01:04:01.346
They're relying fully on this
party to support this house.

1607
01:04:01.421 --> 01:04:02.421
He's right.

1608
01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:04.624
If we shut down this party,
the sorority will dissolve.

1609
01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:06.152
It's time to show
them who's adults,

1610
01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:07.428
and spank their little bottoms.

1611
01:04:07.594 --> 01:04:08.686
I wanna spank them all.

1612
01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:10.764
Let's do what parents
do better than anything,

1613
01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:14.560
stop young people
from having fun!

1614
01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:22.950
Come on in, guys!

1615
01:04:25.403 --> 01:04:27.906
Hey, hope you let yourself
in this party later on.

1616
01:04:29.991 --> 01:04:31.334
You're funny.

1617
01:04:32.494 --> 01:04:34.246
Call your friends, okay?
Tell them to come.

1618
01:04:34.412 --> 01:04:35.629
And bring money!

1619
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:38.963
We shut this motherfucker
down at all costs.

1620
01:04:39.125 --> 01:04:41.503
Y'all go in, shut it
down from the inside.

1621
01:04:41.669 --> 01:04:43.262
Me and Kelly stay, call the cops

1622
01:04:43.338 --> 01:04:44.840
shut it down from the outside.

1623
01:04:44.964 --> 01:04:46.966
Inside, outside.
Got it.

1624
01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:55.525
Now I'm ready.

1625
01:04:56.684 --> 01:04:58.561
Now, I'm ready.

1626
01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:00.488
Jesus Christ, man.
Ow!

1627
01:05:07.362 --> 01:05:08.488
Hey!
Hey.

1628
01:05:08.655 --> 01:05:09.952
What's going on, Kappa Nu?

1629
01:05:10.115 --> 01:05:12.009
Bro, it's only 20 bucks. You've
gotta get down here now.

1630
01:05:12.033 --> 01:05:14.832
They're gonna get wet
everywhere, I swear to God!

1631
01:05:14.994 --> 01:05:17.543
There's so many fucking hot
bitches here, it's ridiculous.

1632
01:05:17.622 --> 01:05:20.171
It's like a hot bitch fiesta.

1633
01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:22.131
They're, like, all
ripe and ready to pop!

1634
01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:24.838
How much money have we made? How
many money buckets do we have?

1635
01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.724
This punch tastes kind of funny.

1636
01:05:27.882 --> 01:05:29.475
We didn't put out any punch.

1637
01:05:29.634 --> 01:05:30.681
Oh, no.

1638
01:05:30.844 --> 01:05:31.987
I'm gonna start phase two, okay?

1639
01:05:32.011 --> 01:05:33.979
Phase two, is we have
to stop the old people

1640
01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:36.057
from calling the cops, okay?

1641
01:05:36.224 --> 01:05:38.067
If you see any old people
in here, stop them!

1642
01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:40.732
I don't like this.
Me neither.

1643
01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:42.693
No! Stop drinking that.

1644
01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.824
Ha! My tongue is numb.

1645
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:46.150
Just blend in.

1646
01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.320
Yes, blend, blend, blend.

1647
01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:49.963
Oh, excusez-moi.

1648
01:05:53.408 --> 01:05:55.911
It's a good party. I am
gonna text my friends.

1649
01:05:56.077 --> 01:05:57.624
No, it's all a lie.
It's a deception.

1650
01:05:57.745 --> 01:05:59.338
They don't think
you're funny, okay?

1651
01:05:59.497 --> 01:06:01.340
What? Oh, fuck me!

1652
01:06:01.541 --> 01:06:03.384
Oh, you okay?
What's wrong?

1653
01:06:03.543 --> 01:06:05.716
I shouldn't have
eaten that McRib.

1654
01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:06.880
It's no big deal.

1655
01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:09.525
I'm just having the worst cramps in
my life every five, six minutes.

1656
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:11.347
Yeah, I think you're
going into labor.

1657
01:06:11.509 --> 01:06:13.386
No, no, no. The baby's
not due till tomorrow.

1658
01:06:13.511 --> 01:06:14.888
You're definitely
going into labor.

1659
01:06:14.971 --> 01:06:16.188
You need to be timing this.

1660
01:06:17.265 --> 01:06:18.767
Oh, it's passed.
I feel great.

1661
01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:20.035
I told you,
she's not going into labor.

1662
01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:21.060
She's all good, dude.

1663
01:06:21.144 --> 01:06:23.238
Whoo!
There she goes.

1664
01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:25.114
You should really go after her.

1665
01:06:25.273 --> 01:06:27.401
She's the boss of her
own body, all right?

1666
01:06:27.567 --> 01:06:28.784
The last night of freedom!

1667
01:06:28.943 --> 01:06:30.069
I love you!

1668
01:06:30.195 --> 01:06:31.287
I love you, bubba!

1669
01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.873
We have to get upstairs. That's
where the power source is.

1670
01:06:34.073 --> 01:06:35.513
What are you doing?
Don't drink that!

1671
01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.034
What's wrong?

1672
01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:39.124
Come on, dude! Never
drink the punch!

1673
01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.584
Oh. Whoo!
Let's go.

1674
01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:53.551
I saw you with Teddy.

1675
01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.186
Why were you with Teddy?

1676
01:06:55.553 --> 01:06:56.554
Shh.

1677
01:06:56.638 --> 01:07:00.438
We're gonna kill the power
and shut down the party.

1678
01:07:01.601 --> 01:07:02.944
What?

1679
01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:06.777
I got real fucked
up really quickly just now.

1680
01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.442
Me, too.

1681
01:07:08.608 --> 01:07:10.326
But all I had was the punch.

1682
01:07:10.610 --> 01:07:12.533
Shit! We got Cosby'd!

1683
01:07:17.617 --> 01:07:18.618
Yes!

1684
01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.791
Kappa Nu,

1685
01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:26.843
good night to you.

1686
01:07:36.928 --> 01:07:39.477
They must have an
alternate power source.

1687
01:07:39.639 --> 01:07:44.270
Banana! Banana! Banana!

1688
01:07:44.435 --> 01:07:45.982
Must stop you!

1689
01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.818
Oh, my God. Look how
big my tongue is.

1690
01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.800
Look how big my tongue is.

1691
01:07:56.197 --> 01:07:57.198
Ew!

1692
01:07:57.323 --> 01:07:59.200
Shit! Fuck!

1693
01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:01.369
Party's big enough, let's
call the cops. Okay.

1694
01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:02.537
Hey, sweet tart!

1695
01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:05.207
It's a little hard to call the
cops without a phone, ain't it?

1696
01:08:05.373 --> 01:08:07.000
Give us that back!
No!

1697
01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:08.292
Drop it!

1698
01:08:08.459 --> 01:08:10.132
Whoa. Ah!
Ooh.

1699
01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:11.504
What the fuck?

1700
01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:13.014
Called a cord, dumb-ass!

1701
01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:14.799
Fucking old people phone!

1702
01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:19.141
What the hell?

1703
01:08:19.304 --> 01:08:20.430
Where are our phones?

1704
01:08:20.513 --> 01:08:21.513
Oh, what, these?

1705
01:08:21.556 --> 01:08:23.229
How'd you get those?

1706
01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:26.527
Come on.

1707
01:08:28.313 --> 01:08:29.665
Yo! I couldn't find
the power source.

1708
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:31.441
Shelby took our phones.
Do you have a phone?

1709
01:08:31.524 --> 01:08:33.492
No, I don't have a phone.
Iran out of data.

1710
01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:34.698
Shit!

1711
01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:36.005
- I'm in here, guys.
- Garage.

1712
01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:37.622
Don't try and find me though.

1713
01:08:40.074 --> 01:08:42.623
Oh, you're getting warmer.
Getting warmer.

1714
01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.204
You're definitely
getting warmer.

1715
01:08:44.370 --> 01:08:45.713
Ooh, ooh.
You're getting warmer.

1716
01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:46.964
<i>Getting warmer.</i>

1717
01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.132
<i>Bingo.</i>

1718
01:08:49.208 --> 01:08:50.255
Shit!

1719
01:08:50.335 --> 01:08:51.552
No!

1720
01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:54.189
I'm not gonna let you out until we're
done raising money, all right?

1721
01:08:54.213 --> 01:08:55.760
There's energy
bars in the corner.

1722
01:08:56.007 --> 01:08:58.068
There's some water, and there's
a poo bucket if you need it.

1723
01:08:58.092 --> 01:08:59.093
Shit!

1724
01:08:59.177 --> 01:09:00.895
You come back here, young lady!

1725
01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:02.573
Kelly! Help us! Shelby!
RIPPED BY ELAJOHN

1726
01:09:02.597 --> 01:09:03.849
Come back here!

1727
01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:06.730
Come back here right now.

1728
01:09:06.893 --> 01:09:08.895
It's locked. She locked it.

1729
01:09:09.062 --> 01:09:11.406
Okay. Calm down,
let me think.

1730
01:09:12.273 --> 01:09:13.900
All right here's the plan.

1731
01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:16.445
We're gonna throw everything
we can at this door.

1732
01:09:16.611 --> 01:09:18.033
What are you doing?

1733
01:09:18.196 --> 01:09:19.556
I'm pooing!
When I'm nervous I poo!

1734
01:09:19.697 --> 01:09:20.698
Look away.

1735
01:09:20.865 --> 01:09:23.914
Suck it back up.
We gotta get out of here.

1736
01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:25.249
Yo, get out of the way.

1737
01:09:25.411 --> 01:09:26.458
Big man!

1738
01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.167
Come on!

1739
01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:33.969
Ooh.
Shit!

1740
01:09:34.128 --> 01:09:37.428
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1741
01:09:37.882 --> 01:09:40.010
Let's try something else.

1742
01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.219
I'm fine.

1743
01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:47.809
Oh, shit! Mac, you okay?

1744
01:09:47.892 --> 01:09:48.893
I'm good.

1745
01:09:53.690 --> 01:09:54.691
Ooh.

1746
01:09:54.816 --> 01:09:56.238
You broke my bike.

1747
01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:57.660
That didn't work.

1748
01:09:57.777 --> 01:09:59.120
No! Do you got
another one in you?

1749
01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.446
I think...

1750
01:10:05.243 --> 01:10:06.620
That's it.

1751
01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:08.963
That's our way out.

1752
01:10:10.623 --> 01:10:11.749
That's way too high up.

1753
01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:12.921
No, it's not.

1754
01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.752
What are you gonna do?

1755
01:10:15.128 --> 01:10:16.730
I don't have the keys.
Can you hot-wire it?

1756
01:10:16.754 --> 01:10:17.954
We can drive through the wall.

1757
01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:19.411
No, I don't know
how to hot-wire.

1758
01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:21.638
But I do know
a thing or two about

1759
01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.012
airbags.

1760
01:10:26.639 --> 01:10:28.641
Set it down really soft.

1761
01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:34.943
Okay.

1762
01:10:35.273 --> 01:10:37.651
Now if we do this correctly,

1763
01:10:37.817 --> 01:10:41.492
the force from that airbag should
blast us straight through that vent.

1764
01:10:42.029 --> 01:10:44.498
Okay. Who's gonna do it?

1765
01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:46.659
I'm gonna do it.
Thank God.

1766
01:10:46.826 --> 01:10:48.294
I don't think
I could do this-.

1767
01:10:49.787 --> 01:10:51.255
You okay, man?

1768
01:10:51.539 --> 01:10:53.883
Are we gonna still
hang out after this?

1769
01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.009
Are you gonna
wanna hang out with me?

1770
01:10:56.169 --> 01:10:57.512
Yeah.

1771
01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:00.219
And like even though,
like, the war is over,

1772
01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:03.385
I wanna, sort of, be of
value, you know, to you?

1773
01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:05.519
Yeah.

1774
01:11:07.472 --> 01:11:08.724
Prove it.

1775
01:11:09.015 --> 01:11:10.358
Prove what?

1776
01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:12.484
Hug me.

1777
01:11:14.228 --> 01:11:15.354
I'm good.

1778
01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:17.027
Give me a hug.

1779
01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:18.692
Give me a real hug.

1780
01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.235
What does that do?

1781
01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:22.403
It solidifies the bond, bro.

1782
01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.369
Bring it in.

1783
01:11:28.701 --> 01:11:31.045
I appreciate you man.
Thank you.

1784
01:11:32.205 --> 01:11:34.048
This is actually really nice.

1785
01:11:36.667 --> 01:11:39.170
Oh, man.
This just feels good.

1786
01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.385
Yeah, I like that.
Boom! Yeah!

1787
01:11:41.547 --> 01:11:43.720
That's it. Powerful.
Power. Yeah!

1788
01:11:44.717 --> 01:11:46.310
Yeah!

1789
01:11:46.511 --> 01:11:47.683
Yeah!

1790
01:11:47.762 --> 01:11:49.435
All right, that's a little much.

1791
01:11:49.597 --> 01:11:50.849
Thanks, buddy!

1792
01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:53.234
Oh, dude. I like this
broing down shit.

1793
01:11:53.392 --> 01:11:55.190
Dude, we are bros, okay?
Yes.

1794
01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:57.071
Let's do this man!
All right.

1795
01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:58.527
Okay, before you do this,

1796
01:11:58.689 --> 01:12:01.693
maybe just make 100% sure that...

1797
01:12:01.776 --> 01:12:03.278
you're all lined up.

1798
01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:04.570
Get ready?

1799
01:12:04.695 --> 01:12:07.824
One! Two! And three! Two! Three!

1800
01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:10.538
Oh, God!

1801
01:12:10.785 --> 01:12:12.787
Oh, no!
Are you okay?

1802
01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.710
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1803
01:12:14.872 --> 01:12:16.215
I'm fine. I got this.

1804
01:12:16.374 --> 01:12:17.717
No, you don't got this at all.

1805
01:12:17.792 --> 01:12:19.419
You for sure have
a concussion, man.

1806
01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:22.134
Dude. I'm okay. I
just need 10 minutes.

1807
01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.578
No! I'm gonna
take it from here.

1808
01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.350
Be careful.

1809
01:12:31.806 --> 01:12:32.807
Okay.

1810
01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.276
It's time.

1811
01:12:44.110 --> 01:12:45.953
Time to save my family.

1812
01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:52.118
Are you okay?

1813
01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:53.411
It worked!

1814
01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:56.630
Oh, God.

1815
01:12:58.958 --> 01:12:59.959
Whoo.

1816
01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:01.836
Hey, girls!
Guess what?

1817
01:13:02.003 --> 01:13:03.596
I got rid of the old people.

1818
01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:05.631
They're trapped in
the garage. We're fine.

1819
01:13:05.798 --> 01:13:06.799
What is that?

1820
01:13:06.966 --> 01:13:08.246
Boob! Boob! Boob!

1821
01:13:12.638 --> 01:13:13.639
This party sucks.

1822
01:13:14.265 --> 01:13:15.938
I can't be here anymore.

1823
01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:17.352
Guys, guys.
We're good.

1824
01:13:17.435 --> 01:13:18.482
Are we though?

1825
01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:19.987
Wet T-shirt contest!

1826
01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:22.486
No! Stop!

1827
01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.168
You're all winners.
You're all winners.

1828
01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:25.489
Yeah, baby!

1829
01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:27.161
I think I'm quitting-.

1830
01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:28.321
Yeah, I'm quitting, too.

1831
01:13:28.487 --> 01:13:29.488
I'm out.

1832
01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:31.491
No! You all can't quit.
We'll figure it out!

1833
01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:32.783
Wait!

1834
01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.549
Wait! Girls, let's just
talk about this for a second. Okay?

1835
01:13:35.578 --> 01:13:37.046
Stop it! Slow down!

1836
01:13:37.204 --> 01:13:38.330
Hold up! Stop!

1837
01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:40.875
Just stop moving!
Okay? Look...

1838
01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:43.886
Oh, God. The party's
even bigger.

1839
01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.015
What the fuck?
What happened?

1840
01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.551
I've been roofied,
so if anyone's

1841
01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:51.181
ever wanted to have sex with me,

1842
01:13:51.260 --> 01:13:52.432
tonight's the night.

1843
01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.864
The plan is almost done, okay?

1844
01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:56.482
I got the old people away.
Everything's fine.

1845
01:13:56.557 --> 01:13:57.649
We're Kappa Nu.

1846
01:13:57.725 --> 01:14:00.444
This isn't Kappa Nu-This
is not what we set out for.

1847
01:14:00.519 --> 01:14:02.487
That's what? That's it?
You're gonna quit?

1848
01:14:02.563 --> 01:14:04.531
Oh, come on. Don't blame us.
You ruined this-

1849
01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:06.109
I look like Nicki Minaj!

1850
01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:07.614
I look like Snooki.

1851
01:14:07.693 --> 01:14:10.367
I was the only one trying to save this.
This was all my idea.

1852
01:14:10.446 --> 01:14:12.574
You're literally
running away to quit.

1853
01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:13.967
Whole fucking thing's imploding.

1854
01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:16.369
So we're gonna destroy
their friendship?

1855
01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:18.167
No, we're just...

1856
01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:19.462
<i>We got escrows,</i> dude.

1857
01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:23.335
We tried. We tried our <i>asses</i> off.
This <i>is</i> not gonna work.

1858
01:14:23.417 --> 01:14:26.717
The whole system is against us
and that's all there is to it-

1859
01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:28.969
All right. I give up.

1860
01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:32.389
We live in a sexist world and there
is nothing we can do about it.

1861
01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.061
I can't believe
this is actually over.

1862
01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:35.896
And now I'm gonna
lose all my friends

1863
01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:37.532
and it's gonna be just
like I was in high school.

1864
01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:38.899
I just wish we had never started

1865
01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.727
this stupid sorority
in the first place.

1866
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:41.936
I don't like this.

1867
01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:43.271
They shouldn't be saying that.

1868
01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:44.571
They're just kids.

1869
01:14:45.356 --> 01:14:46.357
No, it's over.

1870
01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:48.409
No, it's done.

1871
01:14:48.567 --> 01:14:50.911
Hey, hey,
hey! Ladies!

1872
01:14:52.571 --> 01:14:53.663
Get your shit together!

1873
01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:55.082
What's with the meltdown?

1874
01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:58.787
You're strong, powerful women and
you're trying to buck the system.

1875
01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.748
You're just away from home for the
first time and you're scared.

1876
01:15:01.831 --> 01:15:03.003
I am scared.

1877
01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:04.208
You got this.

1878
01:15:04.291 --> 01:15:06.269
You know what the right thing to do is.
You know what's right.

1879
01:15:06.293 --> 01:15:07.437
We know the right
decision to make.

1880
01:15:07.461 --> 01:15:08.508
We know it.

1881
01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:09.907
What's the right
decision to make?

1882
01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:11.762
Don't give up on yourselves.

1883
01:15:11.924 --> 01:15:13.221
Give us a little more.

1884
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:14.736
You get knocked down,
you get up again.

1885
01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.762
They're never
gonna keep you down.

1886
01:15:16.971 --> 01:15:18.973
Did you just make that up?

1887
01:15:19.056 --> 01:15:20.478
Kelly.

1888
01:15:20.683 --> 01:15:22.651
Tell them to make
out with each other.

1889
01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:26.322
Tell them the house isn't
Kappa Nu, they are.

1890
01:15:26.647 --> 01:15:29.446
This house isn't your
sorority, you are!

1891
01:15:29.608 --> 01:15:31.155
No, the mom is right.

1892
01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.587
Why are we doing this right now?

1893
01:15:32.611 --> 01:15:34.172
Why don't we just throw
the party we wanna throw

1894
01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:35.924
and worry about what's
gonna happen tomorrow?

1895
01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:37.495
It doesn't matter
if we lose that.

1896
01:15:37.575 --> 01:15:40.419
It matters if we lose this.

1897
01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:49.421
- You guys.
- I'm so happy.

1898
01:15:51.464 --> 01:15:52.465
Ooh...

1899
01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:53.800
Sisters' hug!

1900
01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:56.477
I wanna see
them kiss so fucking bad.

1901
01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:59.281
All right, let's kick all
these douchebags out of our house-

1902
01:15:59.305 --> 01:16:01.558
Good speech, sweetie!
Thanks, baby.

1903
01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:02.687
Where did that come from?

1904
01:16:02.808 --> 01:16:03.855
We have a daughter, baby.

1905
01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:05.120
What happens with
our escrows now?

1906
01:16:05.144 --> 01:16:07.372
I don't know, but I think it's
the best possible outcome.

1907
01:16:07.396 --> 01:16:08.397
Okay.

1908
01:16:09.648 --> 01:16:11.992
Jimmy! Jimmy!
Where are you?

1909
01:16:12.234 --> 01:16:13.611
Oh, fuck! Paula.

1910
01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:20.285
Guys, I think I was wrong.

1911
01:16:20.451 --> 01:16:21.748
It's not the McRib.

1912
01:16:22.661 --> 01:16:24.254
Oh, my God! No!

1913
01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:25.582
Oh, God!

1914
01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:27.257
It's got my foot!

1915
01:16:27.416 --> 01:16:29.384
It's a breech! It's a breech!
Ugh!

1916
01:16:30.002 --> 01:16:32.221
Go to the hospital!

1917
01:16:32.421 --> 01:16:34.344
I love you.
I love you!

1918
01:17:04.662 --> 01:17:06.039
Are we gonna lose our house?

1919
01:17:06.205 --> 01:17:08.674
I mean we have no money, so we're
definitely losing it. Yeah.

1920
01:17:08.749 --> 01:17:10.877
Well, we better blow it out!

1921
01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:16.139
Guys, this party is
amazing. You did it.

1922
01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:19.435
The first sorority that can party.
We'd all love to join.

1923
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:20.557
Who's "we"?

1924
01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:29.737
Uh, drop your dues in the
bucket if you wanna join.

1925
01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.147
Do we have to wear hoodies?

1926
01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.736
I mean, no offense to you guys,
but I like to dress pretty.

1927
01:17:33.899 --> 01:17:36.573
No, dude. You can totally
wear whatever you want.

1928
01:17:36.944 --> 01:17:38.491
Welcome to Kappa Nu.

1929
01:17:38.571 --> 01:17:39.914
Welcome, you guys!

1930
01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:44.667
Oh, my God!

1931
01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:45.744
Come in.

1932
01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:48.664
Money in the bucket. Just
some money in the bucket.

1933
01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:50.465
Yeah, just throw it
in the bucket.

1934
01:18:03.846 --> 01:18:04.847
Hey, Pete.

1935
01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.056
Pete.

1936
01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:07.725
Pete, wake up, man.

1937
01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:09.268
Pete.

1938
01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:10.857
Dude, what the fuck?

1939
01:18:10.936 --> 01:18:12.279
What are you doing?

1940
01:18:12.438 --> 01:18:14.190
Just calm down.
Just listen.

1941
01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:16.108
I'm sorry, okay?

1942
01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:17.948
I'm sorry.

1943
01:18:18.110 --> 01:18:19.202
When you two got engaged,

1944
01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:20.905
I was in a bad place

1945
01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.290
and I thought I was
losing my best friend.

1946
01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:26.328
Then I realized I'm
never gonna lose you

1947
01:18:27.077 --> 01:18:28.829
because we're brothers.

1948
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.797
Forever.

1949
01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:33.042
Right?
For life.

1950
01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.757
I'm not losing a best friend,

1951
01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:37.964
I'm gaining a best
friend's husband.

1952
01:18:40.299 --> 01:18:41.425
Motherfucker!

1953
01:18:41.467 --> 01:18:44.141
Hey, hey, hey! It's okay.
It's all right.

1954
01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:45.530
Teddy and I are just making up.

1955
01:18:45.554 --> 01:18:46.646
Okay.

1956
01:18:49.808 --> 01:18:51.651
Um, can I ask you something?

1957
01:18:52.228 --> 01:18:53.275
Yeah, man.

1958
01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:59.322
Would you maybe
wanna be my best man?

1959
01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.454
Holy shit. Really?
Yeah.

1960
01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:03.798
Yes, I'll be your
best man, dude.

1961
01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.995
I love you.
Love you, dude.

1962
01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:07.501
You, too!

1963
01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:09.958
- Come over here.
- Get over here!

1964
01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.088
I have two brothers now.

1965
01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:23.017
I see your shitty
be-yourself party

1966
01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.803
is even more popular than
your fucking sell-out party.

1967
01:19:25.970 --> 01:19:26.971
So, that's fantastic.

1968
01:19:27.096 --> 01:19:29.690
Actually, it's really
good for you

1969
01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:33.478
because we are prepared to give
back to you for helping us

1970
01:19:33.686 --> 01:19:36.360
with your escrowdom.

1971
01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:38.857
We've made a shit ton of money,

1972
01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:40.985
eight buckets,
actually, full of money,

1973
01:19:41.151 --> 01:19:42.869
and we have way too
many people wanting

1974
01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:44.667
to join our sorority
than we have room for.

1975
01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:46.862
Yeah, we can actually afford
to fill two houses now-

1976
01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:49.956
Can we rent your
house for overflow?

1977
01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:52.713
- Yeah.
- Just an idea.

1978
01:19:52.871 --> 01:19:57.547
We are prepared to offer you four
buckets of money per month in rent.

1979
01:19:57.626 --> 01:19:58.627
Five.

1980
01:19:59.712 --> 01:20:01.464
Five. We'll do it
for five buckets.

1981
01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:03.382
Per month. Five
buckets per month.

1982
01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:05.017
Five buckets it is.

1983
01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:08.145
Fuck, yes!
Eat shit! We win!

1984
01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:09.768
Give us more!

1985
01:20:09.888 --> 01:20:11.060
You can do this every month?

1986
01:20:11.140 --> 01:20:12.141
When can we move in?

1987
01:20:12.224 --> 01:20:14.443
Right now! Who cares?
Give us the money! Yes!

1988
01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.638
We're gonna be landlords!
How hard could it be?

1989
01:20:17.396 --> 01:20:18.739
Fuck it.
Fuck you!

1990
01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:22.234
Thank you!

1991
01:20:22.401 --> 01:20:24.620
Overflow party!

1992
01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.097
Oh, man.

1993
01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:50.228
I'm gonna miss this place.

1994
01:20:50.763 --> 01:20:52.606
Our first house.

1995
01:20:52.765 --> 01:20:54.187
When Stella was a little baby.

1996
01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:55.351
Mmm-hmm.

1997
01:20:55.517 --> 01:20:56.997
That's where she
took her first steps.

1998
01:20:57.102 --> 01:20:58.399
Yep.

1999
01:20:58.604 --> 01:21:00.044
That's where she
said her first word.

2000
01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:03.529
Those are the little notches
when she was growing taller.

2001
01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:05.035
You see your little notches?

2002
01:21:05.194 --> 01:21:06.787
Remember those, Stels?

2003
01:21:09.573 --> 01:21:11.371
It's all going by so fast, huh?

2004
01:21:11.533 --> 01:21:12.785
Yeah, it's crazy.

2005
01:21:12.951 --> 01:21:13.952
Yep.

2006
01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:15.496
Okay.

2007
01:21:15.579 --> 01:21:16.922
Let's go.

2008
01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:18.583
Come this way?

2009
01:21:37.226 --> 01:21:38.569
It's our new house!

2010
01:21:38.644 --> 01:21:40.692
You can't even
see the neighbours.

2011
01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:49.079
You know what? I think
we are good parents.

2012
01:21:49.154 --> 01:21:50.906
I mean, we parented Teddy.

2013
01:21:50.989 --> 01:21:53.833
We parented 30
crazy sorority girls.

2014
01:21:54.118 --> 01:21:55.745
Well, we're trying.
Yeah.

2015
01:21:55.828 --> 01:21:57.138
Because that's all
you can do, right?

2016
01:21:57.162 --> 01:21:58.379
I think so.

2017
01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:00.583
The truth is, it doesn't
even matter if we're

2018
01:22:00.666 --> 01:22:02.293
good parents or not,
because one day,

2019
01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:03.844
our daughters are
going to look at us

2020
01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:05.424
just like those
sorority girls do.

2021
01:22:05.504 --> 01:22:07.427
They're not gonna want
anything to do with us.

2022
01:22:07.506 --> 01:22:09.099
They're not gonna
wanna talk to us.

2023
01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:10.266
It breaks my heart.

2024
01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:11.343
Momma.

2025
01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.012
Are you scared?

2026
01:22:14.513 --> 01:22:15.605
I'm scared.

2027
01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:16.682
Come on, sweetie.

2028
01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:21.195
Come on, sweetie.

2029
01:22:22.146 --> 01:22:24.069
Hey, cheeky girl!

2030
01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:25.695
Hey, sweetie.
How are you?

2031
01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:26.960
Do you wanna go to sleep?

2032
01:22:26.984 --> 01:22:28.128
Do you want to go to sleep?

2033
01:22:28.152 --> 01:22:29.369
Not yet.

2034
01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:31.743
Not yet? You wanna just hang
out for a little bit more?

2035
01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:34.730
Can you play
Peek-a-boo?

2036
01:22:35.075 --> 01:22:36.076
Peek-a-boo!

2037
01:22:38.537 --> 01:22:39.709
Ooh.

2038
01:22:40.581 --> 01:22:41.833
Peek-a-boo!

2039
01:22:42.249 --> 01:22:43.546
Peek-a-boo!

2040
01:22:44.585 --> 01:22:45.677
Peek-a-boo!

2041
01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:47.921
You'll always be really
nice to us, won't you?

2042
01:22:48.005 --> 01:22:49.357
You'll always be our
best friend, right?

2043
01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:51.181
We'll always have things
to talk about, right?

2044
01:22:51.383 --> 01:22:52.384
Mmm-hmm.

2045
01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.483
Hey!
Hey, sweetie!

2046
01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:04.859
Hey, sweetie!

2047
01:23:05.022 --> 01:23:06.239
I'm not sad.

2048
01:23:06.398 --> 01:23:07.615
No, I'm fine.

2049
01:23:08.150 --> 01:23:10.619
I love you, sweetie.

2050
01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:12.446
Love you.

2051
01:23:23.248 --> 01:23:24.851
How do you feel'? Good?

2052
01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.297
Yeah.

2053
01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.128
The nerves are kicking
in a little bit.

2054
01:23:28.212 --> 01:23:30.260
Well, you look great.
Thanks!

2055
01:23:30.422 --> 01:23:32.641
You all right? You
seem really nervous.

2056
01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.718
I'm having a little
bit of a meltdown.

2057
01:23:34.927 --> 01:23:36.679
Just remember, man,

2058
01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:40.395
Darren loves you more than
anyone in the entire world-

2059
01:23:41.683 --> 01:23:43.606
Darren cherishes his
friendship with you.

2060
01:23:45.187 --> 01:23:47.906
Darren can't imagine
his life without you.

2061
01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:52.532
And Darren is proud
to call you his best friend.

2062
01:23:52.611 --> 01:23:54.238
You're not talking
about Darren, are you?

2063
01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:55.413
No, not really.

2064
01:23:56.281 --> 01:23:57.783
Let's get you
married though, huh?

2065
01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:01.165
All right, everybody.
Look alive, look alive!

2066
01:24:01.245 --> 01:24:05.250
We have Groom One and he is ready
to walk along with his best man.

2067
01:24:05.415 --> 01:24:06.462
You ready for us?

2068
01:24:06.625 --> 01:24:09.094
I'm proud of you, man.
You found your niche.

2069
01:24:09.211 --> 01:24:10.891
This just seemed like
a logical conclusion.

2070
01:24:10.963 --> 01:24:12.055
Gay wedding planning.

2071
01:24:12.130 --> 01:24:14.804
It's a great job, and you can
do it with a criminal record-

2072
01:24:14.883 --> 01:24:16.885
My only skill is
planning parties.

2073
01:24:16.969 --> 01:24:20.519
And, for some reason, gay guys
specifically, they just respond to me.

2074
01:24:20.639 --> 01:24:22.437
It's because you're a great guy.

2075
01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:23.892
Thanks, man.

2076
01:24:23.976 --> 01:24:25.870
And they probably wanna
fuck the shit out of you.

2077
01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:27.737
Hey, I didn't say it.

2078
01:24:27.813 --> 01:24:28.985
You did.

2079
01:24:29.773 --> 01:24:30.865
Delta Psi.

2080
01:24:31.191 --> 01:24:32.659
Delta Psi.

2081
01:24:33.318 --> 01:24:34.945
Let's get you married, okay?

2082
01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:36.204
Yes. Let's do it.

2083
01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.452
And we are walking.

2084
01:24:39.157 --> 01:24:41.251
Hey, guys, we're
home with baby Mildred!

2085
01:24:41.785 --> 01:24:43.708
Welcome home!
How's it going?

2086
01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:44.788
How was the birth?

2087
01:24:45.038 --> 01:24:47.166
It's over now.
Yes.

2088
01:24:47.249 --> 01:24:48.341
Did you shit on the table?

2089
01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:50.294
No.
Me neither.

2090
01:24:50.377 --> 01:24:51.378
Pro.

2091
01:24:51.461 --> 01:24:53.054
So much shit.

2092
01:24:54.881 --> 01:24:57.009
Aw. You got a present for
your new little sister?

2093
01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.802
Baby's first dildo.

2094
01:24:58.885 --> 01:25:00.558
Thank you, Stella.

2095
01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:02.355
Oh, my God. You guys
are just like us.

2096
01:25:03.056 --> 01:25:04.148
Go on, show them.

2097
01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:06.352
This is
Jimmy Jr.'s favorite.

2098
01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:10.234
We kind of have a "no veins
rule" with our vibrators.

2099
01:25:10.314 --> 01:25:11.874
Maybe get one without a
ball sack attached to it.

2100
01:25:11.898 --> 01:25:14.777
Put that away.
Put it away.

2101
01:25:14.985 --> 01:25:18.034
Are you ready to meet
your cousin, Jimmy Jr}?

2102
01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:19.914
Look at her.

2103
01:25:21.033 --> 01:25:23.877
Look at this.
Families are meeting.

2104
01:25:24.911 --> 01:25:26.629
Look at that.
Oh, my God.

2105
01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:29.003
“Hi, Jimmy Jr.
I'm Mildred."

2106
01:25:29.249 --> 01:25:30.250
Cute.

2107
01:25:30.542 --> 01:25:33.967
"Hi, Mildred.
One day, we are going to fuck!"

2108
01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:35.690
"No,
that's never going to happen

2109
01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:38.092
"because my parents are gonna
teach me to respect myself

2110
01:25:38.175 --> 01:25:39.973
"and stay away
from guys like you."

2111
01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:41.554
I could do this all day.
I could, too.

2112
01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:43.197
We're gonna go. We're gonna
get out of your hair.

2113
01:25:43.221 --> 01:25:45.064
Thank you for watching Stella.
Thank you, guys.

2114
01:25:45.223 --> 01:25:46.520
Oh, my God. Anytime.

2115
01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.647
Bye. She's beautiful.

2116
01:25:47.726 --> 01:25:49.478
Thanks, you guys.
Thanks, guys.

2117
01:25:49.895 --> 01:25:51.021
Bye.

2118
01:25:52.064 --> 01:25:53.407
We did it.
We did it.

2119
01:25:53.482 --> 01:25:55.234
We had another kid.
We got another one.

2120
01:25:56.068 --> 01:25:57.411
I love you.
I love you.

2121
01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:01.407
Stella, you wanna
kiss your sister? Hey.
