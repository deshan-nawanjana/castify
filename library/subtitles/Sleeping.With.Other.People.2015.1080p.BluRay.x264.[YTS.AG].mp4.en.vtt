Matthew, are you gonna fuck me, or what?

00:01:13.669 --> 00:01:15.770
On it like a bonnet. On it like
a bonnet. On it like a bonnet

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:19.638
- Alright, fight club, what the hell is going on here?
- I'm a guest!

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:22.376
Unless someone signed you into
the building. You are not a guest.

00:01:22.377 --> 00:01:25.412
- <i>Alright? Please.</i>
- Aw, man! I miss my friend.

00:01:25.413 --> 00:01:27.148
- Don't take that tack with me.
- My friend lives here...

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:28.180
Please don't put me in this position.

00:01:28.181 --> 00:01:29.383
Why are you doing this?

00:01:29.384 --> 00:01:31.352
<i>I'm gonna have to call
the campus police.</i>

00:01:31.353 --> 00:01:33.385
Well... uh, now, Jordan,
uh, she's my guest.

00:01:33.387 --> 00:01:34.722
- Uh, my...
- She's your guest, Harper?

00:01:34.723 --> 00:01:36.257
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah.

00:01:36.258 --> 00:01:37.656
She's, uh... Hi, Stephanie... hi, uh...

00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:40.560
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Stephanie. Thank you. Mm-hmm.

00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:43.364
Stephanie... Sanders.

00:01:43.365 --> 00:01:44.831
Stephanie Sanders. Right here.

00:01:44.832 --> 00:01:46.832
- Take care of her, okay?
- Oh, yeah. No, I got this.

00:01:46.833 --> 00:01:48.736
This is all taken care of. You
don't have to worry about that.

00:01:48.737 --> 00:01:50.237
- Thank you.
- Okay.

00:01:50.238 --> 00:01:51.772
- Thanks, man. Sorry.
- Thank you.

00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:55.276
- Oh, rock and roll.
- What?

00:01:55.277 --> 00:01:57.612
- I said, rock and roll.
- Oh.

00:01:57.613 --> 00:01:59.546
Alright, this is uh... This is us.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.272
"Us." You're funny.

00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:09.457
Nice porn.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:11.313
Ha ha. Yeah. Ha...

00:02:12.527 --> 00:02:13.983
Nice panties.

00:02:15.495 --> 00:02:17.298
- Who are you?
- I'm Jake.

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:18.933
Lainey.

00:02:18.934 --> 00:02:20.734
It's a nickname they give
to people named Elaine.

00:02:20.735 --> 00:02:21.903
<i>Elaine's great name.</i>

00:02:21.904 --> 00:02:24.804
- It's like, Elaine! Elaine...
- Hey!

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:29.409
If you ever even mention The Graduate
again, I will slit your throat.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.136
Okay, Lainey. Glad we got that cleared up.

00:02:34.415 --> 00:02:36.917
Welcome to my Thursday night. Huh?

00:02:36.918 --> 00:02:39.387
You, uh... You wanna watch porn?

00:02:39.388 --> 00:02:40.877
Smoke drugs?

00:02:41.422 --> 00:02:44.292
Ugh! This sucks!

00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:46.861
- Mm.
- You know what I was gonna do tonight?

00:02:46.862 --> 00:02:49.429
Judging from your outfit,
I'd say scale a mountain?

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.298
- Lose my virginity.
- <i>Hold on a second...</i>

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.466
You were gonna lose your
virginity to Matthew Sobvechik

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:55.570
in 11B at Wein Dormitory?

00:02:55.571 --> 00:02:58.271
He's the TA in my pre-med bio class.

00:02:58.272 --> 00:03:00.975
I'm deliberately failing to
get work sessions with him.

00:03:00.976 --> 00:03:04.376
We fool around after he teaches
me things I already know.

00:03:04.378 --> 00:03:06.947
Jesus! How Matthew Sobvechik managed to bag

00:03:06.948 --> 00:03:09.281
such a delightfully unhinged hottie

00:03:09.282 --> 00:03:11.953
by being the most boring, fucking guy

00:03:11.954 --> 00:03:15.356
on this entire floor is beyond me.

00:03:15.357 --> 00:03:17.959
- Well, I'm in love with him.
- <i>Come on.</i>

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.726
There's no way you love Matthew Sobvechik

00:03:19.727 --> 00:03:21.928
the Pontiac Aztec of people.

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:24.398
Lainey, you having sex
with Matthew Sobvechik

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:26.565
is basically the same thing

00:03:26.566 --> 00:03:29.469
as me telling an Aborigine
in the Australian outback

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.837
<i>that he's about to
listen to the Beatles</i>

00:03:30.838 --> 00:03:33.374
<i>for the first time, and then
I play him Blues Traveler.</i>

00:03:33.375 --> 00:03:35.643
That's a cruel joke, for I
will have just tricked him

00:03:35.644 --> 00:03:37.944
into thinking Blues Traveler

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:40.846
is the greatest band of all time, okay?

00:03:40.847 --> 00:03:44.483
Now, if you were to sleep
with Matthew Sobvechik

00:03:44.484 --> 00:03:47.454
you would be addicted to mediocrity
for the rest of your life.

00:03:47.455 --> 00:03:49.656
<i>And that barely
covered vagina of yours</i>

00:03:49.657 --> 00:03:51.524
<i>deserves better than that.</i>

00:03:51.525 --> 00:03:55.796
It doesn't deserve John Popper,
it deserves John Lennon. Okay?

00:03:55.797 --> 00:03:57.497
You understand me?

00:03:57.498 --> 00:04:01.290
I'm talkin' about, like, the
"White Album", not "Hook."

00:04:03.305 --> 00:04:04.839
Tell me what sex is like.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.541
Oh, my God! You've got a one track mind.

00:04:07.542 --> 00:04:09.744
Fuck you. Enlighten me.

00:04:09.745 --> 00:04:11.379
You want me to tell you
what sex is like, huh?

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.204
- Mm-hmm. Tell me.
- Okay.

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:17.050
Better be ready.

00:04:17.051 --> 00:04:19.586
- You ready?
- Yes.

00:04:19.587 --> 00:04:21.521
Sex is like, uh...

00:04:21.522 --> 00:04:24.725
It's like kissing with your entire body.

00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:27.294
Very sensual experience.

00:04:27.295 --> 00:04:30.564
It's like shooting heroin
in a... in a controlled yet

00:04:30.565 --> 00:04:33.400
moist environment, you know?

00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:35.369
You know what it's like ...it's
like... it's like Times Square at night.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:39.429
I mean... just the right tinge of danger.

00:04:40.509 --> 00:04:41.965
Sorry.

00:04:46.415 --> 00:04:48.104
Oh, my God.

00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:49.774
What?

00:04:51.353 --> 00:04:52.886
Yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

00:04:52.887 --> 00:04:56.590
Yeah. So I haven't technically...

00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:59.527
...actually really done it yet.

00:04:59.528 --> 00:05:01.028
Why're you laughing at me? That's not...

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:02.797
But you're so old.

00:05:02.798 --> 00:05:05.799
Fuck you. I didn't call you an old virgin.

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.003
I'm not... I'm shocked.
I'm shocked. You're so cute.

00:05:09.004 --> 00:05:10.937
Why're you giving me shit?

00:05:10.938 --> 00:05:13.773
Y-you can't get the most boring dude

00:05:13.774 --> 00:05:16.509
in the dorm to sleep with you.

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:18.745
You know... that... I
mean, that's ridiculous.

00:05:18.746 --> 00:05:20.436
You're the one that's should be...

00:05:23.985 --> 00:05:26.020
No, I'm... I'm sorry.

00:05:26.021 --> 00:05:27.854
I... I'm... I'm...

00:05:27.855 --> 00:05:29.422
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset.

00:05:29.423 --> 00:05:30.657
I thought... I was just joking around.

00:05:30.658 --> 00:05:33.148
You know, I thought we were
joking around. So I was joking.

00:05:36.464 --> 00:05:38.732
This was all, just very romantic

00:05:38.733 --> 00:05:41.124
and then you just fucked it up.

00:05:44.038 --> 00:05:45.528
It was?

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.061
What is this?

00:06:07.062 --> 00:06:08.763
Get it off.

00:06:08.764 --> 00:06:10.220
Jesus.

00:06:15.103 --> 00:06:17.927
I'm so, so sweaty. All this on...

00:06:21.843 --> 00:06:23.131
You're incredible.

00:06:24.678 --> 00:06:27.269

that cab? Sydney Bristow style?

Thank God you stopped,
okay? Please. Please...

00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:33.746

- I'm... okay. Maybe you're right.

00:07:33.747 --> 00:07:35.615
- You might be right.
- How could you fuck her, Jake?

00:07:35.616 --> 00:07:38.818
I look, sorry, I... Ow! Ooh! That got me!

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.688
How could you even kiss
me after you fucked her?

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:42.154
What are we doing in
the middle of the street?

00:07:42.155 --> 00:07:43.990
Ugh! Because I hope we fucking die!

00:07:43.992 --> 00:07:47.061
Will you get... whoa!
Fuckin' please, come on!

00:07:47.062 --> 00:07:50.564
Let's get off the street, okay?
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.

00:07:50.565 --> 00:07:55.235
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, I appreciate
your anger, I really do, okay.

00:07:55.236 --> 00:07:57.972
And Lord knows, I could use the exercise

00:07:57.973 --> 00:08:01.040
but I do believe there are exactly
3 points we should discuss, okay?

00:08:01.041 --> 00:08:04.277
First off, in our initial
conversations about exclusivity

00:08:04.278 --> 00:08:08.081
I distinctly recall you saying
something about "staying casual," yeah?

00:08:08.082 --> 00:08:09.649
- I only said that...
- Most likely because you thought

00:08:09.651 --> 00:08:11.084
that was what I wanted to hear, yes?

00:08:11.085 --> 00:08:14.121
- Yes.
- Okay. Well, me taking you at your word

00:08:14.122 --> 00:08:16.923
doesn't make me an asshole, it
does however make you a liar.

00:08:16.924 --> 00:08:18.657
Ugh! You're such a piece of shit...

00:08:18.658 --> 00:08:21.560
Hey. Second... second point. Okay?

00:08:21.561 --> 00:08:24.064
If you really, actually wanted monogamy

00:08:24.065 --> 00:08:27.535
why have casual sex
with me for three months?

00:08:27.536 --> 00:08:30.804
You know, I mean, If you wanna grow
flowers, you don't plant 'em in a closet.

00:08:30.805 --> 00:08:35.975
So either you're stupid or deep down
inside you don't want monogamy either.

00:08:35.976 --> 00:08:38.078
You fucked my best friend.

00:08:38.079 --> 00:08:40.613
Which brings me to my
third and final point.

00:08:40.614 --> 00:08:43.750
Your chief complaint is
not that I screwed someone

00:08:43.751 --> 00:08:45.718
it is <i>who</i> I screwed.

00:08:45.719 --> 00:08:47.621
That's what it's about, right?

00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:50.623
So much like your, uh,
the counter-intuitive plan

00:08:50.624 --> 00:08:52.660
to secure an exclusive relationship

00:08:52.661 --> 00:08:54.828
with a guy that you
don't actually wanna date.

00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:57.130
<i>Moi.</i> Your issue with me and Sarah...

00:08:57.131 --> 00:08:58.366
- Do not say her name.
- Was a lot...

00:08:58.367 --> 00:09:02.803
Your issue with us is purely
driven by a societal insecurity.

00:09:02.804 --> 00:09:06.740
Not to mention, a culturally
infused female competition.

00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:09.043
Oh! My heart goes out to you ladies.

00:09:09.044 --> 00:09:11.977
Baby, you're a bad liar.

00:09:11.978 --> 00:09:14.346
You're not stupid.

00:09:14.347 --> 00:09:18.017
And she can't hold a candle to you.

00:09:18.018 --> 00:09:19.819
Can we please go home?

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.088
Please?

00:09:22.089 --> 00:09:24.024
You know, get out of these wet clothes.

00:09:24.025 --> 00:09:26.449
And dry each other off using friction.

00:09:29.763 --> 00:09:30.896
Yeah?

00:09:30.897 --> 00:09:33.732
- Yeah.
- Good.

00:09:33.734 --> 00:09:34.790
Whoa!

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:42.141
- You got a girlfriend, Charles?
- No.

00:09:42.142 --> 00:09:45.044
Playing the field, hmm?

00:09:45.045 --> 00:09:47.714
Be careful.

00:09:47.715 --> 00:09:49.505
- You know?
- Why?

00:09:51.651 --> 00:09:53.708
I don't know if I have time to answer that.

00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:02.630
Wow. Bathroom fucking stinks.

00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:05.932
Um, what were we talking
about? So I said to Jack.

00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:09.302
I said, "Jack, Lainey and
I, we're looking to buy.

00:10:09.303 --> 00:10:11.905
Maybe have a kid."

00:10:11.906 --> 00:10:14.007
I hope it's okay that
I said that, by the way.

00:10:14.008 --> 00:10:16.043
I mean, you haven't changed
your mind or anything, have you?

00:10:16.044 --> 00:10:18.211
Because I know you don't
wanna get married, but you know

00:10:18.212 --> 00:10:20.713
I do think it's important we make
some sort of commitment to each other

00:10:20.714 --> 00:10:24.683
and I think buying a
place, maybe Kensington

00:10:24.684 --> 00:10:26.686
maybe Prospect Heights.

00:10:26.688 --> 00:10:29.054
What's up, little nugget, what
are you doing with the notebook?

00:10:29.056 --> 00:10:31.724
Sam. I have to read you something.

00:10:31.725 --> 00:10:34.261
You've been writing again?

00:10:34.262 --> 00:10:36.796
- Sweetie, that's great!
- No...

00:10:36.797 --> 00:10:38.130
- I was never writing.
- Honey, yes!

00:10:38.131 --> 00:10:40.400
- It was one short story...
- Yes! That is great!

00:10:40.401 --> 00:10:42.301
No, listen. Listen...

00:10:42.302 --> 00:10:44.038
I wanna tell you something, look at me.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:47.207
Look at me, okay? I know you love teaching.

00:10:47.208 --> 00:10:50.176
But that's not a real thing. I
mean, this is great. This is...

00:10:50.177 --> 00:10:52.245
Can you please just not interrupt
me while I read this, please.

00:10:52.246 --> 00:10:54.346
- Just listen to it. Let me get through all of it.
- I won't.

00:10:54.347 --> 00:10:56.149
I don't think I interrupt you, but go on.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.984
- Don't.
- I don't.

00:10:57.986 --> 00:11:00.420
- Please don't interrupt.
- I would love to hear it.

00:11:00.421 --> 00:11:02.578
- Okay, mister.
- Wow me.

00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:05.780
- Sam.
- Lainey.

00:11:09.196 --> 00:11:14.434
"My therapist suggested that
I attend a 12 step program

00:11:14.435 --> 00:11:16.937
for recovery from a love addiction

00:11:16.938 --> 00:11:18.338
and romantic obsession..."

00:11:18.339 --> 00:11:20.741
I'm sorry... beep, beep,
squeak, um, hello...

00:11:20.742 --> 00:11:22.808
Did you say "Love addiction?"

00:11:22.809 --> 00:11:25.212
- "And romantic obsession..."
- Sweetie. Sweetie.

00:11:25.213 --> 00:11:28.214
- You might as well face it, you're addicted to love.
- "Obsession..."

00:11:28.215 --> 00:11:30.384
- Huey Lewis.
- No, it's Robert Palmer.

00:11:30.385 --> 00:11:32.018
"That I've had for the last 10 years.

00:11:32.020 --> 00:11:35.121
"As a result I have been
able to stay faithful to you

00:11:35.122 --> 00:11:37.189
- for the past 6 months..."
- Okay, let me just stop you because...

00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:41.261
- I feel like...
- Sam, I'm trying to tell you something.

00:11:41.262 --> 00:11:43.163
- I know. I would love to hear what you're telling me.
- Sam.

00:11:43.164 --> 00:11:46.033
- Can you listen to what I'm saying to you...
- I'm trying to.

00:11:46.034 --> 00:11:48.367
Yeah. I'm listening.

00:11:48.368 --> 00:11:51.038
"I wanna move forward in our
relationship in an honest way."

00:11:51.039 --> 00:11:56.343
Oh, I know it. Bein' Honest ...honest,
critical appraisal is the foundation...

00:11:56.344 --> 00:11:58.433
Sam, I cheated on you.

00:12:13.126 --> 00:12:14.951
You cheated on me?

00:12:19.767 --> 00:12:22.857
Baby, how many times?

00:12:25.906 --> 00:12:27.230
16.

00:12:33.281 --> 00:12:34.915
I don't even know 16 guys.

00:12:34.916 --> 00:12:36.916
- 16 guys...
- No, the same guy.

00:12:36.917 --> 00:12:38.841
16 times.

00:12:41.255 --> 00:12:42.322
- Who?
- It doesn't matter...

00:12:42.323 --> 00:12:44.024
- Tell me who.
- It doesn't...

00:12:44.025 --> 00:12:46.025
- My brother?
- No.

00:12:46.026 --> 00:12:47.461
- Was it my brother?
- No.

00:12:47.462 --> 00:12:48.395
- Was it my brother?
- Stop.

00:12:48.396 --> 00:12:50.163
You know I'm not attracted to your brother.

00:12:50.164 --> 00:12:51.564
Who's so fuckin' hot?

00:12:51.565 --> 00:12:54.266
Who is better than my brother?

00:12:54.267 --> 00:12:56.068
- I'm not gonna tell you...
- I deserve to know.

00:12:56.069 --> 00:12:57.069
- No, I'm...
- I deserve to know.

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:00.273
I've been getting his
second fucking servings.

00:13:00.274 --> 00:13:04.077
I've been tasting his sweat.
Who's juices have I tasted?

00:13:04.078 --> 00:13:06.947
If I've been drinking his
juices, I wanna know who it is.

00:13:06.948 --> 00:13:09.348
I'm not gonna involve him in
this and make things worse.

00:13:09.349 --> 00:13:14.854
Oh, oh. You involved my brother
when you fucked him 16 times!

00:13:14.855 --> 00:13:18.525
Who can tell what that
fuckin', swarthy man...

00:13:18.526 --> 00:13:20.993
What? Get out of here! Get out of here!

00:13:20.994 --> 00:13:23.295
Please! Why did you
have to do this in public

00:13:23.296 --> 00:13:25.030
were you trying to humiliate me?

00:13:25.032 --> 00:13:27.534
Look it! Look it! He's
looking! I'm embarrassed.

00:13:27.535 --> 00:13:30.102
- You won!
- I was sacred that you would freak out.

00:13:30.103 --> 00:13:31.938
Yeah! Oh, well you thought right.

00:13:31.939 --> 00:13:34.596
Get ready for a Classic Sam freak out!

00:13:37.477 --> 00:13:39.512
Sam, wait. I'm sorry.

00:13:39.513 --> 00:13:43.183
Please, please, don't leave... I'm sorry.

00:13:43.184 --> 00:13:46.520
I wanna make this work.
I'm trying to get better.

00:13:46.521 --> 00:13:48.454
You can't get better.

00:13:48.455 --> 00:13:52.014
Lainey, you're not an addict, okay?

00:13:55.629 --> 00:13:57.719
You're just a whore.

00:13:59.498 --> 00:14:01.523
You're a whore!

00:14:04.939 --> 00:14:06.896
You're a fuckin' whore!

00:14:58.425 --> 00:15:00.192
Before I started this program

00:15:00.193 --> 00:15:03.329
I thought "love" was a feeling.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.197
But that's bullshit, it's not a feeling

00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:08.793
<i>it's a decision,
like everything else.</i>

00:15:08.794 --> 00:15:12.639
<i>And I see now that when I was in
my addiction I made the decision</i>

00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:17.309
<i>over and over again to choose
sex over my self-worth.</i>

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:19.112
<i>And it doesn't mean that
I don't like sex now</i>

00:15:19.113 --> 00:15:22.481
it doesn't mean that I'm
not a sexual person. Gail.

00:15:22.482 --> 00:15:24.517
I don't need to go trolling online looking

00:15:24.518 --> 00:15:26.185
<i>for women to go down on.</i>

00:15:26.186 --> 00:15:28.053
<i>I don't need to fuck
8 guys on one night.</i>

00:15:28.055 --> 00:15:30.689
<i>I don't deny what I've
done. I embrace my past.</i>

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:32.693
<i>Yes, I did once call one of my
neighbors in the middle of the day</i>

00:15:32.694 --> 00:15:35.027
<i>when he was at work and said,
"Grab some condoms and meet me</i>

00:15:35.028 --> 00:15:38.596
<i>at that delicious soft
pretzel place." Who cares?</i>

00:15:38.597 --> 00:15:43.035
I did let someone put a protein
bar up my ass once. Big deal.

00:15:43.036 --> 00:15:45.472
<i>I did hack into my
supermarket's Instagram account</i>

00:15:45.473 --> 00:15:49.041
<i>and posted a picture of my asshole
and said, there was a sale on asshole.</i>

00:15:49.042 --> 00:15:51.666
<i>And then said, "Come and lick
my asshole if you're bald."</i>

00:16:02.089 --> 00:16:04.078
Of all the gin joints.

00:16:05.392 --> 00:16:07.148
No way.

00:16:08.295 --> 00:16:10.120
- <i>Jake.</i>
- Yes.

00:16:14.035 --> 00:16:17.069
Oh, my God. Were y-you
just in that meeting?

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:18.771
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure was. Uh-huh.

00:16:18.772 --> 00:16:21.964
Yeah. Had to get out of there,
though. It was making me super horny.

00:16:23.777 --> 00:16:27.680
Wow. It's been... What? 12 years?

00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:30.083
I think it might actually be longer. Yeah.

00:16:30.084 --> 00:16:32.140
- Wow.
- Yeah. You look good.

00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:35.521
- So do you.
- Thank you.

00:16:35.522 --> 00:16:39.059
Wow! The "Old virgin."

00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.395
Don't you mean the one that got away?

00:16:41.396 --> 00:16:43.462
- Stop.
- <i>Oh, last thing I remember, we had that...</i>

00:16:43.463 --> 00:16:46.632
awesome night together
and you just sort of...

00:16:46.633 --> 00:16:49.567
- Disappeared.
- <i>Oh, plus you were all hung up on that guy</i>

00:16:49.568 --> 00:16:51.070
that lived next door to me, the boring guy.

00:16:51.071 --> 00:16:53.040
The, uh, Marcus, or, uh...

00:16:53.041 --> 00:16:54.341
- Matthew.
- <i>That's right.</i>

00:16:54.342 --> 00:16:55.608
I heard he's a lady doctor now.

00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:57.376
- Oh?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

00:16:57.377 --> 00:16:58.612
<i>You ever see him around?</i>

00:16:58.613 --> 00:17:00.713
I assume like... doctor things?

00:17:00.714 --> 00:17:02.581
- Aren't you a doctor now?
- Oh, I didn't do that.

00:17:02.582 --> 00:17:04.251
I didn't end up going to med school.

00:17:04.252 --> 00:17:05.618
- Oh.
- I teach...

00:17:05.619 --> 00:17:07.187
- Cool.
- Now, yeah, kids.

00:17:07.188 --> 00:17:08.554
- Great.
- Kindergarten.

00:17:08.555 --> 00:17:10.157
Alright.

00:17:10.158 --> 00:17:11.824
You? What do you... what do you...

00:17:11.825 --> 00:17:14.325
A buddy and I created this
CDN and we're selling it

00:17:14.326 --> 00:17:16.162
to a digital media provider...
And you're bored already?

00:17:16.163 --> 00:17:17.264
- No.
- You just asked me.

00:17:17.265 --> 00:17:19.800
I know. I'm sorry. I have to...

00:17:19.801 --> 00:17:22.535
<i>Respond to that booty
text I assume, right?</i>

00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:24.602
Oh, come on, Lainey.

00:17:24.603 --> 00:17:26.305
I was watchin' you in there.

00:17:26.306 --> 00:17:29.810
I saw ya. Checkin' your
phone every 5 minutes.

00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:32.646
<i>All that tension in your shoulders.
Legs crossed, playin' with your hair...</i>

00:17:32.647 --> 00:17:34.648
- Why are you here?
- <i>Hmm.</i>

00:17:34.649 --> 00:17:36.782
- To pick up women?
- No, no, Heaven's no.

00:17:36.783 --> 00:17:39.717
No, not women, no. Just you evidently.

00:17:41.588 --> 00:17:43.422
I'll see you around.

00:17:43.423 --> 00:17:45.691
Hopefully not here.

00:17:45.692 --> 00:17:47.182
Yeah.

00:17:47.862 --> 00:17:49.684
Hey, I'm on Facebook!

00:17:50.832 --> 00:17:53.556
What... a weird thing to say out loud.

00:18:09.784 --> 00:18:13.419
- You know, I have one last question... actually...
- Oh, come on. Come on.

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:18.491
It's like... um, when I sign
this, what happens to everything

00:18:18.492 --> 00:18:21.495
that Xander and I worked on,
like, all the content we created?

00:18:21.496 --> 00:18:26.197
We dissolve all past and current product.
And you'll work exclusively for us.

00:18:26.198 --> 00:18:29.736
Yeah. Right. Time to settle down.

00:18:29.737 --> 00:18:33.640
- That's true. That's true. But what if we have...
- No. No.

00:18:33.641 --> 00:18:37.343
I will straight up murder you if
you do not sign this immediately.

00:18:37.344 --> 00:18:39.179
Xander, I'm lookin' out for us.

00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.913
You're lookin' out for us?
No, I'm lookin' out for us.

00:18:40.914 --> 00:18:42.782
- You're being a dick...
- <i>Here's the thing, guys.</i>

00:18:42.783 --> 00:18:45.885
I don't negotiate, but my lawyers do.

00:18:45.886 --> 00:18:48.755
So if you wanna reopen the terms
of the contract, that's fine

00:18:48.756 --> 00:18:51.291
I'm just gonna go grab some lunch.

00:18:51.292 --> 00:18:56.630
No, alright. Alright. Alright. Alright.
Okay. You know... y... you just...

00:18:56.631 --> 00:18:58.465
<i>You don't have to go for lunch yet.</i>

00:18:58.466 --> 00:19:00.255
Okay.

00:19:04.438 --> 00:19:06.739
Congrats, boys. You
have officially sold out.

00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.440
Fuck yes!

00:19:09.442 --> 00:19:12.545
Oh, my God!

00:19:12.546 --> 00:19:14.581
- I really thought you were gonna fuck this up.
- Me too.

00:19:14.582 --> 00:19:18.919
- I really did. He fucks everything in life up.
- Yeah, yeah, I do.

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.754
I have two beautiful children

00:19:20.755 --> 00:19:23.354
both are gonna have
ridiculously terrible teeth.

00:19:23.355 --> 00:19:26.593
So you're getting braces,
you're getting braces

00:19:26.594 --> 00:19:28.349
you're getting braces!

00:19:29.528 --> 00:19:32.253
Hey. You going to lunch? Can I come with?

00:19:34.266 --> 00:19:37.304
Dinner maybe? How about brunch
with my folks, you'll love them.

00:19:37.305 --> 00:19:38.271
- You're smart, handsome...
- Thank you.

00:19:38.272 --> 00:19:40.873
And now have stocks vesting until 2018.

00:19:40.874 --> 00:19:42.409
You can go get any woman you want.

00:19:42.410 --> 00:19:44.275
Really? Well, I still choose you.

00:19:44.276 --> 00:19:46.212
Why? Because I happened
to be in your eye-line?

00:19:46.213 --> 00:19:47.613
Possibly because you're uninterested.

00:19:47.614 --> 00:19:49.716
Most likely because you're
stunning and successful.

00:19:49.717 --> 00:19:51.382
- I'm divorced.
- His loss.

00:19:51.383 --> 00:19:52.986
- I have a kid.
- I love kids.

00:19:52.987 --> 00:19:54.121
Kids love me. I basically am a kid.

00:19:54.122 --> 00:19:57.224
- And I don't sleep with my employees.
- I quit.

00:19:57.225 --> 00:19:58.756
Goodbye, Jacob.

00:19:58.758 --> 00:20:00.715
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

00:20:01.629 --> 00:20:03.729
- Huh.
- What?

00:20:03.730 --> 00:20:05.599
Paula's somethin' else, huh?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.266
Yeah, she really is.

00:20:07.267 --> 00:20:09.301
She was vibin' me pretty
hard in that meeting.

00:20:09.302 --> 00:20:11.871
- Well, you're a married man.
- Yeah, I know. I made sure to tell her.

00:20:11.872 --> 00:20:13.974
- 'Cause I was, like, I didn't wanna embarrass her...
- Yeah, yeah.

00:20:13.975 --> 00:20:15.674
- That's good. Let her down easy.
- Yeah.

00:20:15.675 --> 00:20:18.978
<i>Good afternoon, Dr.
Sobvechik's office.</i>

00:20:18.979 --> 00:20:22.615
<i>I'm sorry the doctor's not available
right now. May I take a message?</i>

00:20:22.616 --> 00:20:25.950
Elaine. Elaine Dalton?

00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:31.358
Yes, um... sorry. It's Lainey.
Only my father calls me Elaine.

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:34.383
Mm-hmm. Dr. Sobvechik will see you now.

00:20:43.270 --> 00:20:46.439
You didn't have to make an appointment.

00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:49.797
This used to be our move. Me
pretending to be a patient.

00:20:53.014 --> 00:20:54.979
You look great.

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:57.816
It's been a while.

00:20:57.817 --> 00:21:00.075
I get worried when you disappear.

00:21:01.521 --> 00:21:03.789
Me too.

00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.814
It's really good to see you.
W... what do you wanna talk about?

00:21:08.461 --> 00:21:10.384
- I can't see you anymore.
- I agree.

00:21:12.699 --> 00:21:14.823
Yeah. I think...

00:21:16.403 --> 00:21:19.773
- We need to be over.
- I asked Emma to marry me.

00:21:19.774 --> 00:21:21.474
I mean, she kept bringing it up.

00:21:21.475 --> 00:21:23.374
Thought it was the right thing to do.

00:21:23.375 --> 00:21:25.299
<i>Dr. Sobvechik's office...</i>

00:21:27.047 --> 00:21:29.082
Oh, you and Emma got back together?

00:21:29.083 --> 00:21:32.074
Yes, uh... uh did I not tell you that?

00:21:40.361 --> 00:21:45.064
- How is Sam?
- He is... fine.

00:21:45.065 --> 00:21:46.522
Good.

00:21:50.371 --> 00:21:53.896
Glad we ended it face to
face. You were right to come.

00:22:02.917 --> 00:22:04.417
Will you do me a favor?

00:22:04.418 --> 00:22:07.911
Will you erase your number from my phone?

00:22:09.956 --> 00:22:12.147
I won't be able to do it.

00:23:07.614 --> 00:23:09.648
Is this what you want, Elaine?

00:23:09.649 --> 00:23:11.182
Yes.

00:23:11.183 --> 00:23:13.574
I want it all the time.
It's all I think about.

00:23:58.998 --> 00:24:01.256
<i>Good afternoon, Dr.
Sobvechik's office.</i>

00:24:02.701 --> 00:24:05.193
<i>I'm sorry the doctor is
unavailable right now.</i>

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.608
<i>- He's getting married.
- Who would marry him?</i>

00:24:09.609 --> 00:24:12.511
<i>Like, can she consent?
Is she in a coma?</i>

00:24:12.512 --> 00:24:15.781
I mean, who is this person?
Where do you find her?

00:24:15.782 --> 00:24:17.917
Some sort of, like, website

00:24:17.918 --> 00:24:20.820
for people who want to have
a horrible, painful life...

00:24:20.821 --> 00:24:24.523
I think I need to stop having
sex all together for a while.

00:24:24.524 --> 00:24:26.792
No, alright. The problem isn't sex.

00:24:26.793 --> 00:24:28.092
The problem is Captain Amazing

00:24:28.094 --> 00:24:29.661
has monopolized your vag for like a decade

00:24:29.662 --> 00:24:30.830
and now you're a pod person.

00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:33.099
But maybe if I'm not having any sex...

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.101
And become a sexually anorexic? No.

00:24:35.102 --> 00:24:36.969
What? Is that a real thing?

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.138
Yeah, of course it's a real thing.

00:24:38.139 --> 00:24:40.873
Sexual anorexian. It's like
depriving yourself of sex

00:24:40.874 --> 00:24:45.543
because of low self-esteem,
or abuse or other gnarly shit.

00:24:45.544 --> 00:24:47.246
That's great. That's another dysfunction
I have to worry about developing.

00:24:47.247 --> 00:24:49.849
It's like enough with this shit.

00:24:49.850 --> 00:24:51.718
Sobvechik! It's like enough!

00:24:51.719 --> 00:24:53.918
I mean, you can do so much better.

00:24:53.919 --> 00:24:56.021
I don't care if it's a woman
or if it's somebody else

00:24:56.022 --> 00:24:59.557
just anything but the schmuck.

00:24:59.558 --> 00:25:02.128
I feel like people are looking at us.

00:25:02.129 --> 00:25:03.129
The guy I lost my virginity to

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:05.030
was at my sex addicts meeting.

00:25:05.032 --> 00:25:06.865
What do you think that means?

00:25:06.866 --> 00:25:08.267
It's a sign.

00:25:08.268 --> 00:25:12.804
You should fuck that guy. A lot.

00:25:12.805 --> 00:25:16.642
<i>I don't think everyone should just be
running around fucking willy-nilly, okay?</i>

00:25:16.643 --> 00:25:21.202
In your specific case I do think
you should fuck that sex addict.

00:25:24.817 --> 00:25:27.052
♪ One look in the mirror ♪

00:25:27.054 --> 00:25:30.412
♪ And I know the party is over ♪♪

00:25:32.625 --> 00:25:34.183
You have lipstick on your teeth.

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.564
- Thank you.
- This is my wife! This is Blainey.

00:25:38.565 --> 00:25:40.865
- Lainey. Lainey... with an L.
- Oh.

00:25:40.866 --> 00:25:43.457
What's wrong with you?

00:25:43.967 --> 00:25:45.970
- Never make it end.
- This is, uh, Lainey! Lainey, Naomi.

00:25:45.971 --> 00:25:48.908
- Oh, may God.
- This is my wife.

00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:51.811
Shots. I'm getting everybody shot. Shots
for all round. We're going to keep it going.

00:25:51.812 --> 00:25:54.046
Top shelf, bro, because
we're rich as shit now.

00:25:54.047 --> 00:25:56.849
- Okay, stop screaming that.
- Rich as shit!

00:25:56.850 --> 00:26:00.018
I'm telling you, someone's gonna
murder us if you keep screaming...

00:26:00.019 --> 00:26:05.024
I don't care. We're in a cool
bar. I just bought a Tesla!

00:26:05.025 --> 00:26:07.927
That's not true. We are borrowing
a Tesla to see if we like it.

00:26:07.928 --> 00:26:10.862
- Yeah.
- Listen, are you guys, um...

00:26:10.863 --> 00:26:13.165
- Are you guys sleeping with each other?
- No.

00:26:13.166 --> 00:26:15.868
- Oh, good. Oh, my God, good.
- What're you guys talking about?

00:26:15.869 --> 00:26:17.937
I'm telling her not to
have sex with you! Sorry.

00:26:17.938 --> 00:26:21.596
Oh, yeah, well you're too late! 'Cause
we lost our virginity to each other!

00:26:23.611 --> 00:26:25.143
- Are you serious?
- You didn't know.

00:26:25.144 --> 00:26:28.380
- Yeah, I told him earlier.
- We all knew. You didn't know!

00:26:28.382 --> 00:26:30.616
- That's a beautiful story.
- Yeah.

00:26:30.617 --> 00:26:32.250
- So romantic.
- Right!

00:26:32.251 --> 00:26:33.885
Here we go. Bring it in.

00:26:33.886 --> 00:26:36.089
- To virginity!
- To virginity!

00:26:36.090 --> 00:26:37.813
Get lost.

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.660
- Here we go.
- I gotta go. I just gonna go outside for a...

00:26:42.661 --> 00:26:45.930
That was good. Naomi still
has her anal virginity.

00:26:45.931 --> 00:26:48.634
That's not true. A lot of guys
have been up there, just not you.

00:26:48.635 --> 00:26:50.169
Oh, wait, wait. Girl, girl, girl...

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:52.104
- Lainey, her name's Lainey.
- Lainey. Lainey, I'm sorry.

00:26:52.105 --> 00:26:54.273
Quick question before
you walk out the door...

00:26:54.274 --> 00:26:59.245
Are you the reason that my friend Jake
here is like, the biggest slut in the world?

00:26:59.246 --> 00:27:01.213
- What are you doing?
- I'm saying, like

00:27:01.214 --> 00:27:03.416
he puts his dick in like,
every sticky hole he finds.

00:27:03.417 --> 00:27:05.217
- That's not true.
- It gross.

00:27:05.218 --> 00:27:06.352
- Xander.
- But like I'm jels.

00:27:06.353 --> 00:27:08.687
Come on.

00:27:08.688 --> 00:27:10.355
- No, I'm just kidding.
- I don't know. I don't know.

00:27:10.356 --> 00:27:12.056
I'm just kidding. I know it's
not you. I know it's not you.

00:27:12.057 --> 00:27:14.360
- I know it's because his dad molested him.
- What?

00:27:14.361 --> 00:27:16.728
- What?
- Now everybody knows!

00:27:16.729 --> 00:27:18.031
He was a boy scout leader.

00:27:18.032 --> 00:27:20.900
- Yeah.
- Bro, you're welcome. You're welcome.

00:27:20.901 --> 00:27:23.135
- How am I welcome?
- I just set that up for you.

00:27:23.136 --> 00:27:25.271
- Wait a minute, where is she going?
- Yeah, don't let her get away.

00:27:25.272 --> 00:27:28.006
Dude, you gotta chase after her.

00:27:28.007 --> 00:27:31.075
- She's your lobster, man.
- I know. Okay, alright.

00:27:31.077 --> 00:27:33.211
She seems...

00:27:33.212 --> 00:27:34.313
- Awesome.
- Amazing.

00:27:34.314 --> 00:27:37.149
Hey, Lainey!

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.084
- What are you doin'? Where are you going?
- Sorry, sorry, yeah.

00:27:40.086 --> 00:27:42.921
I just... I wanna thank you
for tonight. It was great.

00:27:42.922 --> 00:27:45.890
Just go... go in and have
fun with your friends.

00:27:45.891 --> 00:27:48.760
I just... I Facebooked
you because I thought...

00:27:48.761 --> 00:27:50.763
I should start dating again, I'm
trying to get over this guy...

00:27:50.764 --> 00:27:52.488
Was this supposed to be a date?

00:27:54.101 --> 00:27:56.168
Oh shit, it was...

00:27:56.169 --> 00:27:59.304
Oh hell. I'm an idiot,
I'm sorry, I'm a dick.

00:27:59.305 --> 00:28:01.907
I'm sorry, I didn't... I didn't know. I...

00:28:01.908 --> 00:28:03.175
Well, hey... hey, how
about we go on a date?

00:28:03.176 --> 00:28:05.044
This is a date now. We'll go out.

00:28:05.045 --> 00:28:07.112
- So now it's...
- Yeah, it's a date. Let's go on a date.

00:28:07.113 --> 00:28:09.915
This is good. I'll go inside,
I'm gonna get my jacket

00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:13.986
then I'll come out and
we'll, uh... date it up.

00:28:13.987 --> 00:28:17.957
<i>Matthew Sobvechik? That guy had all
the charm of a broken Etch a sketch.</i>

00:28:17.958 --> 00:28:21.494
It feels so freeing to tell someone
about it. Who actually knows him.

00:28:21.495 --> 00:28:24.764
Okay, you're gonna have to explain
this to me. I mean, is he packing? Huh?

00:28:24.765 --> 00:28:26.931
Is that what's going on?
Does it tip in hundreds?

00:28:26.932 --> 00:28:28.801
Read you the Polar Express before bedtime?

00:28:28.802 --> 00:28:30.768
You know, it's pretty average actually.

00:28:30.770 --> 00:28:34.106
Ah, Goddammit! Even his junk is boring.

00:28:34.107 --> 00:28:37.110
God damn boring dick!

00:28:37.111 --> 00:28:40.012
That's so weird, and
you're a catch! It's true.

00:28:40.013 --> 00:28:43.015
You know, I'm serious. You've
got a strong vocabulary.

00:28:43.016 --> 00:28:46.307
You look dynamite in a tank
top. It's just... what gives?

00:28:46.754 --> 00:28:47.842
I guess...

00:28:50.957 --> 00:28:54.959
I guess, I just thought
eventually he'd choose me.

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.830
- Mm-hmm.
- And so I always chose him.

00:28:57.831 --> 00:29:00.999
If he texted I'd think of
an excuse. I'd lie, I'd...

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.003
- That's psychotic.
- Mm. Thanks.

00:29:04.004 --> 00:29:05.970
Well, I mean it's not your fault.

00:29:05.971 --> 00:29:07.907
You know, little girls are told

00:29:07.908 --> 00:29:10.176
that someday they're gonna find the one.

00:29:10.177 --> 00:29:11.811
What they don't tell
you guys is that the one

00:29:11.812 --> 00:29:13.079
might be a complete fucking dickhead

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:15.948
with a boring heroin penis that
turns you all into a sex addict

00:29:15.949 --> 00:29:17.016
that's what they leave
out in the Disney movies...

00:29:17.017 --> 00:29:18.217
I'm not sex addict.

00:29:18.218 --> 00:29:19.317
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Me neither.

00:29:19.318 --> 00:29:20.419
I went to a few meetings

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.986
because my therapist suggested

00:29:21.987 --> 00:29:24.055
that I go, that it... that it might help.

00:29:24.056 --> 00:29:26.524
- But it didn't, so I stopped.
- Okay.

00:29:26.525 --> 00:29:28.259
What's your excuse?

00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.829
- Me?
- Yeah.

00:29:29.830 --> 00:29:30.862
My girlfriend said if I didn't go

00:29:30.863 --> 00:29:31.930
she'd break up with me.

00:29:31.931 --> 00:29:33.099
So I went to a meeting.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.793
She broke up with me anyway. I'm cured.

00:29:35.794 --> 00:29:38.317
- Well why did she want you to go?
- I don't know.

00:29:42.542 --> 00:29:46.512
She... some have suggested

00:29:46.513 --> 00:29:50.048
that I have a little bit of
a problem staying faithful

00:29:50.049 --> 00:29:53.352
for long periods of
time... Or possibly at all.

00:29:53.353 --> 00:29:56.455
Oh. And it all comes out.

00:29:56.456 --> 00:30:01.193
Look, once I come to the
realization that I'm with...

00:30:01.194 --> 00:30:02.527
...the wrong girl...

00:30:02.528 --> 00:30:04.563
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't know how to end it.

00:30:04.564 --> 00:30:08.399
- So you sabotage it by sleeping with other people?
- Mm. Exactly.

00:30:08.401 --> 00:30:11.469
Yeah. Obviously they get upset

00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:14.606
but then comes the whole rigmarole
of, like, "You're afraid to commit"

00:30:14.607 --> 00:30:17.476
and it's like "No, I just
don't wanna commit to you."

00:30:17.477 --> 00:30:20.044
But I can't say that, because
that's, like, mean on top of mean.

00:30:20.045 --> 00:30:22.014
You know, so it's "No, no,
no. It's not you, it's me.

00:30:22.015 --> 00:30:25.284
I don't like you."

00:30:25.285 --> 00:30:27.186
- You know, like that.
- Yeah, that's harsh.

00:30:27.187 --> 00:30:28.888
- That's harsh, right You can't say that.
- That's pretty harsh.

00:30:28.889 --> 00:30:31.524
So instead I'd rather
just say something like...

00:30:31.525 --> 00:30:32.891
"I fucked your sister."

00:30:32.892 --> 00:30:35.460
- Much better.
- Well, it's honest.

00:30:35.461 --> 00:30:38.063
You have to fuck the sister
in order for it to work.

00:30:38.065 --> 00:30:40.064
- It's like I'd rather...
- Be the bad guy than tell the truth.

00:30:40.065 --> 00:30:43.357
- See. You get it.
- Oh, yeah. But I'm psychotic.

00:30:45.305 --> 00:30:47.473
But like an approachable psychotic.

00:30:47.474 --> 00:30:50.074
- That's the thing I don't think I mentioned earlier.
- You like it?

00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:52.378
Yeah, it's like... it's
like Ted Bundy, you know.

00:30:52.379 --> 00:30:54.979
You can't get him into a
van by just being a jerk.

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:56.181
You've got to have a certain...

00:30:56.182 --> 00:30:58.350
...way about you.

00:30:58.351 --> 00:31:00.919
- Appetite?
- That would be... that would be something.

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.189
- Yes, yes, yes.
- I'm hungry again.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:05.056
Already?

00:31:05.057 --> 00:31:07.959
Well, you know, that's Dim Sum for you.

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:09.128
- I have snacks... I have snacks at home.
- Yeah.

00:31:09.129 --> 00:31:11.596
I have, uh, this is
actually... This is my train.

00:31:11.597 --> 00:31:12.965
- What here? Oh, yeah, yeah.
- So...

00:31:12.966 --> 00:31:14.300
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Alright.

00:31:14.301 --> 00:31:16.267
So, I'll probably gonna hit the road.

00:31:16.268 --> 00:31:18.670
- Yeah.
- Jake, thank you.

00:31:18.671 --> 00:31:20.973
- Yeah.
- Oh.

00:31:20.974 --> 00:31:23.575
Hey, this was a... We did
it. That was a good date.

00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:26.312
- We did the date.
- You know, I think it was the first...

00:31:26.313 --> 00:31:27.979
I think it might have been the
first date I've ever been on

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:29.114
so I don't really have
much to compare it to

00:31:29.115 --> 00:31:30.381
but, you know, it seemed solid.

00:31:30.382 --> 00:31:31.417
- Good.
- Yeah.

00:31:31.418 --> 00:31:33.651
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:31:33.652 --> 00:31:35.220
Shit.

00:31:35.221 --> 00:31:37.523
What?

00:31:37.524 --> 00:31:40.081
I, uh, I want to fuck you.

00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:41.659
- What?
- I know.

00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.362
- No!
- What do you mean no?

00:31:43.363 --> 00:31:46.297
What? What? What did I do?

00:31:46.298 --> 00:31:47.932
- Stop wanting to.
- I mean, are you kidding me?

00:31:47.933 --> 00:31:49.468
It's kinda hard. I mean, look at you.

00:31:49.469 --> 00:31:51.704
I mean, you're so pretty
and you're vulnerable

00:31:51.705 --> 00:31:53.538
and it's just like you might as
well be wearing a sign that says

00:31:53.539 --> 00:31:54.672
"Solve my problems with your penis, Jake."

00:31:54.673 --> 00:31:57.275
Jake, we just spent the
entire evening talking about

00:31:57.276 --> 00:31:59.644
how we screw up every sexual
relationship we've ever have.

00:31:59.645 --> 00:32:03.716
I know, I... I right. I mean, and yet
here I am like wanting... just now.

00:32:03.717 --> 00:32:06.352
So, maybe... we gotta just be friends.

00:32:06.353 --> 00:32:10.588
Yes, that is the mature,
responsible thing to do, uh...

00:32:10.589 --> 00:32:12.991
...for each other and
ourselves, yes I agree.

00:32:12.992 --> 00:32:14.592
Okay, but then we've got
to come up with a system.

00:32:14.593 --> 00:32:16.161
- If we're gonna be friends, you know...
- Okay.

00:32:16.162 --> 00:32:17.996
- And I want to be good friends...
- It's fair.

00:32:17.997 --> 00:32:22.066
So, maybe we come up with a safe word

00:32:22.068 --> 00:32:24.335
for if we're having sexual tension
and then we'll stop whatever...

00:32:24.336 --> 00:32:25.404
So, if you're doing something
sexy or I'm doing something sexy.

00:32:25.405 --> 00:32:27.672
- Or feeling attracted.
- Okay, but it's mutual?

00:32:27.673 --> 00:32:29.007
- So it is mutual?
- The word.

00:32:29.008 --> 00:32:30.375
You're saying it's mutual?

00:32:30.376 --> 00:32:32.343
- It could be mutual.
- That's a yes.

00:32:32.344 --> 00:32:34.279
- I may or may not need to use the word.
- That's a yes.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.414
- We'll have to see in the future...
- Hmm. Okay, alright.

00:32:35.415 --> 00:32:37.550
Well, let's... well, alright.
Say, uh, say it for me.

00:32:37.551 --> 00:32:38.685
- Uh, yeah. Anything.
- Let's go, come up with one. What you got.

00:32:38.686 --> 00:32:40.986
I'll do anything. What do
you... You pick it, and yes.

00:32:40.987 --> 00:32:42.487
- It's Avocado.
- No. Can't do that.

00:32:42.488 --> 00:32:45.224
- No. It's an immediate veto?
- No, no, no.

00:32:45.225 --> 00:32:47.025
Well, I mean, it's too
sexual. It's too sexual. Uh...

00:32:47.026 --> 00:32:49.327
- "Avocado" is too sexual?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:32:49.328 --> 00:32:51.996
I mean... I mean you've got to see the
way I eat an avocado and you'll be like...

00:32:51.997 --> 00:32:53.666
That's like... You know, do that to me.

00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:57.236
- It's like Guam.
- Guam? Like the country Guam? No!

00:32:57.237 --> 00:32:59.337
No, I knew a girl whose
father was from Guam

00:32:59.338 --> 00:33:01.439
and she literally had one
of the best natural bodies

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.341
I've ever seen in my life.

00:33:02.342 --> 00:33:03.640
Noodle salad.

00:33:03.641 --> 00:33:05.176
"Noodle salad?" that's a sex thing.

00:33:05.177 --> 00:33:06.276
- That's a... that's...
- What?

00:33:06.277 --> 00:33:08.080
That's a bunch of guys putting

00:33:08.081 --> 00:33:09.280
flaccid dicks into someone's mouth.

00:33:09.281 --> 00:33:10.516
That's... that's called a noddle salad.

00:33:10.517 --> 00:33:12.584
That is not a thing.

00:33:12.585 --> 00:33:15.688
I mean it absolutely is a
thing. I know it's a thing.

00:33:15.689 --> 00:33:19.458
- Go to noodlesalad.org...
- Now, I feel like you're just trying to find problems.

00:33:19.459 --> 00:33:21.494
I would make the argument
that you are just suggesting

00:33:21.495 --> 00:33:24.229
only things that can only
be perceived as sexual.

00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:26.631
- So, okay, so it needs to be more violent.
- Mm-hmm, something extra.

00:33:26.632 --> 00:33:27.733
- Yeah, I mean...
- Dick in a mousetrap!

00:33:27.734 --> 00:33:29.134
Yikes! What is that?

00:33:29.135 --> 00:33:30.401
- Oh!
- That's awful!

00:33:30.403 --> 00:33:31.337
- You don't like it.
- No!

00:33:31.338 --> 00:33:32.604
- That's the one.
- What? Are you kid...

00:33:32.605 --> 00:33:34.473
We'll shorten it to mousetrap.

00:33:34.474 --> 00:33:36.641
- Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye.
- Mousetrap? Alright.

00:33:36.642 --> 00:33:37.810
- Uh-oh.
- Goodbye.

00:33:37.811 --> 00:33:39.310
I'm going. I'm going for it.

00:33:39.311 --> 00:33:41.246
- Yeah. Live on the edge.
- Goodnight.

00:33:41.247 --> 00:33:44.105
Careful. Bye.

00:33:44.617 --> 00:33:46.819

we stopped sleeping together.

No, no. He noticed.

it the same way, you know.

"Oh gosh, I... I wonder
how crack is doing?"

00:37:33.978 --> 00:37:36.582

remember that girl Renee?

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:00.038

00:38:18.724 --> 00:38:20.359
I do have HPV though

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.392
and I hope it's the one
that gives you dick cancer.

00:38:22.393 --> 00:38:25.464
Emoji of a heart. XXX Renee.

00:38:25.465 --> 00:38:27.366
Well, that's sort of normal.

00:38:27.367 --> 00:38:28.900
You actively stalked someone today

00:38:28.901 --> 00:38:31.337
your perception of normal might
be a little skewed, my dear.

00:38:31.338 --> 00:38:33.105
- <i>Okay, you slept with her.</i>
- Mm-hmm.

00:38:33.106 --> 00:38:35.473
- Rocked her face.
- Mm-hmm.

00:38:35.474 --> 00:38:36.975
- Yes, with my body.
- You didn't call her.

00:38:36.976 --> 00:38:38.911
I lost my phone in a cab.

00:38:38.912 --> 00:38:42.381
- <i>And you unleashed her Khaleesi.</i>
- Yeah. Wait.

00:38:42.382 --> 00:38:43.515
You mean like "Game of Thrones" Khaleesi?

00:38:43.516 --> 00:38:48.486
Yes. Either A, we make
multiple babies with you.

00:38:48.487 --> 00:38:51.489
Or B, we cut your dick off.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.094
Jesus. I... I've got my fingers
crossed out here for an option C.

00:38:55.095 --> 00:38:58.129
C, you appease her.

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.399
And how do you appease your Khaleesi?

00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:03.024
<i>I spend about a
month's rent on this.</i>

00:39:06.139 --> 00:39:08.540
- What do you think?
- Yeah.

00:39:08.541 --> 00:39:10.942
I mean, you should
definitely wear stuff over it.

00:39:10.943 --> 00:39:13.834
Nice neg. Mousetrap.

<i>Just pick a TV and
we'll get out of here.</i>

00:39:43.610 --> 00:39:45.877
- So tell me what happened.
- Oh, right.

00:39:45.878 --> 00:39:48.080
Okay, yeah, so, uh, I've been
seeing this girl Thea, alright?

00:39:48.081 --> 00:39:49.147
Uh, she's Black.

00:39:49.148 --> 00:39:51.449
- And...
- <i>Wait stop.</i>

00:39:51.450 --> 00:39:54.441
Does this story end with you
doing something super racist?

00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:56.187
Oh, my God. No!

00:39:56.188 --> 00:39:59.857
Why are you telling me she's Black?

00:39:59.858 --> 00:40:03.251
I don't know. I... I'm just trying to
give you a mental picture that's all.

00:40:03.896 --> 00:40:07.533
Okay. Racist. Keep going.

00:40:07.534 --> 00:40:09.634
<i>Okay. Well, we go see a
movie. During the day.</i>

00:40:09.635 --> 00:40:12.069
<i>And she's super smart and
cool and also gorgeous</i>

00:40:12.070 --> 00:40:15.440
but I do what we talked
about. I do not sleep with her.

00:40:15.441 --> 00:40:17.842
You're so strong. I'm so proud.

00:40:17.843 --> 00:40:20.446
Hey. Not all of us can remain
celibate for a year, alright?

00:40:20.447 --> 00:40:22.647
I'm just waiting for the right guy.

00:40:22.648 --> 00:40:25.650
The white guy? Whose racist now?

00:40:25.651 --> 00:40:27.986
- The right guy.
- Oh, the right guy.

00:40:27.987 --> 00:40:30.189
Oh, the one you waited for
10 years. That right guy?

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:32.024
You know, he's married now, that one?

00:40:32.025 --> 00:40:33.057
What're we doing in this aisle?

00:40:33.058 --> 00:40:35.627
Can I finish my story please?

00:40:35.628 --> 00:40:38.730
I wait 4 days and then I
call her and we go out again.

00:40:38.731 --> 00:40:40.933
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Alright. No, sex.</i>

00:40:40.934 --> 00:40:42.667
<i>I mean, we hook up
but I don't, like,</i>

00:40:42.668 --> 00:40:43.700
<i>finger her or anything.</i>

00:40:43.701 --> 00:40:44.736
<i>Awesome.</i>

00:40:44.737 --> 00:40:45.802
<i>So I call her last night</i>

00:40:45.804 --> 00:40:47.070
<i>and I'm like</i>

00:40:47.071 --> 00:40:48.072
"Hey, do you wanna go see

00:40:48.074 --> 00:40:48.906
the new Wes Anderson movie?"

00:40:48.907 --> 00:40:50.576
Ugh!

00:40:50.577 --> 00:40:52.544
What? Well, and then she's like...

00:40:52.545 --> 00:40:54.679
Jake, what are you doing?

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:57.615
And I'm like, "Oh, of course
Wes Anderson is a such a stupid

00:40:57.616 --> 00:40:59.650
white guy thing to suggest," you know.

00:40:59.651 --> 00:41:02.120
- Okay, racist. And also dumb. Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

00:41:02.121 --> 00:41:03.654
You two need any help?

00:41:03.655 --> 00:41:05.190
Uh, no, no, we're good.

00:41:05.191 --> 00:41:06.990
She just takes a while to make a decision.

00:41:06.991 --> 00:41:08.794
- I do.
- Yeah, you got it. Yeah.

00:41:08.795 --> 00:41:10.894
So I'm like "Well do you
wanna go see something else?"

00:41:10.895 --> 00:41:11.929
And then she says...

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:14.165
Why haven't we had sex yet?

00:41:14.166 --> 00:41:15.201
<i>Do you just want to be friends?</i>

00:41:15.202 --> 00:41:18.236
<i>'Cause honestly I
have enough friends.</i>

00:41:18.237 --> 00:41:20.293
Where are you right now?

00:41:23.208 --> 00:41:25.432
Oh, my God!

00:41:31.283 --> 00:41:32.850
Oh!

00:41:32.851 --> 00:41:34.552
That was awesome.

00:41:34.553 --> 00:41:36.009
Oh, my God.

00:41:36.754 --> 00:41:38.745
Oh, golly...

00:41:39.825 --> 00:41:42.861
Oh, sorry if I was too
noisy, but that was like...

00:41:42.862 --> 00:41:44.561
I don't know what got into me.

00:41:44.562 --> 00:41:45.653
Hey.

00:41:46.231 --> 00:41:48.288
Did you, uh...

00:41:48.933 --> 00:41:50.602
- No.
- Oh.

00:41:50.603 --> 00:41:52.538
But don't take it personally.

00:41:52.539 --> 00:41:54.762
I don't orgasm during sex that much.

00:41:55.775 --> 00:41:59.076
So? Lots of women don't cum during sex.

00:41:59.077 --> 00:42:02.281
So? No, no, no. That has
never happened to me before.

00:42:02.282 --> 00:42:03.649
<i>What positions did you do?</i>

00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:05.316
Um. No. We did everything.

00:42:05.317 --> 00:42:06.050
But, what's your favorite position?

00:42:06.051 --> 00:42:08.553
I don't know. The regular one?

00:42:08.554 --> 00:42:11.723
The regular. Come on.

00:42:11.724 --> 00:42:14.158
- From behind.
- Exactly. Because you hate your dad.

00:42:14.159 --> 00:42:15.893
Oh, my God.

00:42:15.894 --> 00:42:17.129
<i>Mousetrap!</i>

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.695
- All set.
- Hmm.

00:42:18.696 --> 00:42:20.965
And can I just say, we think you two

00:42:20.966 --> 00:42:23.968
are the coolest married couple ever.

00:42:23.969 --> 00:42:25.770
- That's... We don't get that enough.
- So sweet.

00:42:25.771 --> 00:42:26.704
- Thank you.
- That's really sweet.

00:42:26.705 --> 00:42:27.940
- Yeah. Happy holidays.
- Let's go, hon.

00:42:27.941 --> 00:42:29.308
Happy holidays. Yes.

00:42:29.309 --> 00:42:31.176
I will just meet you
out by, uh, our minivan.

00:42:31.177 --> 00:42:32.709
- I'll meet you out front.
- Okay, great.

00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:34.013
- I'll have to move the car seat.
- Mm-hmm.

00:42:34.014 --> 00:42:35.979
- And then there will be plenty of room.
- A whole thing.

00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.915
Bye.

00:42:37.916 --> 00:42:40.218
Car seat? We already have a kid?

00:42:40.219 --> 00:42:42.619
You know, it's just
like... When do you orgasm?

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:43.656
You know what, when does it happen to you?

00:42:43.657 --> 00:42:46.624
- When I'm with Matthew.
- Yeah, yeah, okay.

00:42:46.625 --> 00:42:47.715
That's it.

00:42:48.927 --> 00:42:50.894
That's it?

00:42:50.895 --> 00:42:52.663
Okay, well, that just explained everything.

00:42:52.664 --> 00:42:56.835
That... that's... I mean you
haven't had an orgasm in a year.

00:42:56.836 --> 00:43:00.104
<i>Come on, that's bullshit.
Not even when you masturbate?</i>

00:43:00.106 --> 00:43:02.239
<i>Lainey, you've got to be kidding me!</i>

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:04.308
What you don't mastur... Why not?

00:43:04.309 --> 00:43:07.212
What... I don't kno...
I mean, I've tried to!

00:43:07.213 --> 00:43:10.616
I try. I just, I don't know, I... I...

00:43:10.617 --> 00:43:12.282
- I get bored.
- Bored?

00:43:12.283 --> 00:43:15.019
- But I feel good when I'm with Matthew.
- How's that boring?

00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:17.188
I don't... I don't know. I don't
know how to recreate that myself.

00:43:17.189 --> 00:43:19.625
Okay. Well, fuck the TV.

00:43:19.626 --> 00:43:21.024
I'm gonna teach you how
to finger yourself today.

00:43:21.025 --> 00:43:23.060
Right now, okay?

00:43:23.061 --> 00:43:26.131
- What?
- It's... it's go time, sister.

00:43:26.132 --> 00:43:28.899
- Alright. Let's go. Alright.
- Okay.

00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:30.067
- No, no. This is a good thing.
- Oh, boy.

00:43:30.068 --> 00:43:31.335
It's about time. Get it out.

00:43:31.336 --> 00:43:32.669
- Okay.
- I'm excited.

00:43:32.670 --> 00:43:34.739
For the purposes of today's tutorial

00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:36.741
your vagina will be played by this

00:43:36.742 --> 00:43:38.843
former bottle of green tea.

00:43:38.844 --> 00:43:40.344
- Looks just like it.
- Okay. Good to know.

00:43:40.345 --> 00:43:41.311
So, here's what we do.

00:43:41.312 --> 00:43:43.680
First thing, you take, uh, take this guy...

00:43:43.681 --> 00:43:45.716
...this, uh, index finger
and you're gonna just, uh

00:43:45.717 --> 00:43:47.684
slide in there... like that, okay?

00:43:47.685 --> 00:43:48.654
And you're gonna curve it up a little bit

00:43:48.655 --> 00:43:50.922
and I want you to tap the roof like that.

00:43:50.923 --> 00:43:53.323
You see that? That's your G
Spot alright, you got that?

00:43:53.324 --> 00:43:54.859
- Yeah. I'll check it out.
- Okay, good.

00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.661
Alright, now, next move,
alright, you're gonna take

00:43:56.662 --> 00:43:58.663
the middle finger here, alright?
And you know, the bad boy, right?

00:43:58.664 --> 00:44:00.265
You're gonna have to pop that in as well

00:44:00.266 --> 00:44:01.832
and you're gonna have
that one tapping the roof

00:44:01.833 --> 00:44:04.201
and then this one, the
middle finger is going to be

00:44:04.202 --> 00:44:07.672
you know, sort of circling, uh,
this, uh, just like fleshy gap area.

00:44:07.673 --> 00:44:09.706
- My cervix? Jesus.
- Yeah, sure.

00:44:09.707 --> 00:44:12.009
Okay, y-you know what it's
called. Wonderful. Good for you.

00:44:12.010 --> 00:44:13.878
Okay, yes, so you're gonna
go after the cervix here.

00:44:13.879 --> 00:44:16.214
So you're gonna mind the
gap, right, tap the roof.

00:44:16.215 --> 00:44:19.451
- "Mind the gap. Tap the roof."
- You got it.

00:44:19.452 --> 00:44:21.953
Alright, now, at this point you wanna start
thinking about something, uh, arousing.

00:44:21.954 --> 00:44:23.788
You know, like, uh, maybe
you wanna think about

00:44:23.789 --> 00:44:25.690
the guy you lost your virginity to perhaps.

00:44:25.691 --> 00:44:27.426
- Gross.
- Okay, and then you're gonna start to get wet.

00:44:27.427 --> 00:44:28.460
You're gonna start to get wet

00:44:28.461 --> 00:44:30.861
and then you're gonna
start to feel some, uh...

00:44:30.862 --> 00:44:32.896
...contractions in your vagina, alright?

00:44:32.897 --> 00:44:35.232
At that point you're gonna
wanna squeeze your vagina harder

00:44:35.233 --> 00:44:37.435
than it wants to go, okay.

00:44:37.436 --> 00:44:39.471
- And that's called...
- Kegeling.

00:44:39.472 --> 00:44:41.806
Well, it's pronounced
"Kee-gul-ing," but it doesn't matter.

00:44:41.807 --> 00:44:42.940
Uh, I got into med school!

00:44:42.941 --> 00:44:45.276
I think I know how it's pronounced.

00:44:45.277 --> 00:44:47.145
What? You did? You didn't tell me that.

00:44:47.146 --> 00:44:49.246
Oh yeah. I got in, uh, Michigan.

00:44:49.247 --> 00:44:52.984
- Wow! Lane, that's great.
- I know.

00:44:52.985 --> 00:44:55.120
Alright.

00:44:55.121 --> 00:44:57.921
Well, uh, are you... I mean, are
you gonna go? What are you thinking?

00:44:57.922 --> 00:45:00.058
Well, I... I mean, I have until
the end of the summer to decide.

00:45:00.059 --> 00:45:01.225
- So, I just...
- Mm-hmm.

00:45:01.226 --> 00:45:03.428
- Keep going!
- Oh, right. Yeah, um...

00:45:03.429 --> 00:45:05.429
Okay, yeah, da, da, da. Okay, let's see.

00:45:05.430 --> 00:45:07.866
So, uh, do you know what a dirty DJ is?

00:45:07.867 --> 00:45:09.399
- No.
- You don't? Okay, great.

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.769
Okay, so the biggest
misconception that guys

00:45:11.771 --> 00:45:14.071
have about the clitoris,
uh, if they can find it

00:45:14.072 --> 00:45:16.039
- is that they're too nice to it. Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.076
Like... that's the problem.

00:45:17.077 --> 00:45:19.810
I mean, you know, the
trick is to be a little

00:45:19.811 --> 00:45:20.945
rude to the clitoris, okay?

00:45:20.946 --> 00:45:22.080
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

00:45:22.081 --> 00:45:24.815
Just go to town on this
little motherfucker right here.

00:45:24.816 --> 00:45:25.917
You just... like you
just... Tweet, tweet, tweet.

00:45:25.918 --> 00:45:27.118
You know, so that's the dirty DJ.

00:45:27.119 --> 00:45:28.419
You know, like you're scratching
a record. You know, this...

00:45:28.421 --> 00:45:30.844
Tweet tweet tweet.

00:45:31.523 --> 00:45:33.024
Let... let... let the drummer...

00:45:33.025 --> 00:45:35.893
Let... let... let the
drummer get wicked, right?

00:45:35.894 --> 00:45:37.261
And you just really wanna
work that little bugger.

00:45:37.262 --> 00:45:39.464
You know, remember like
the old IBM ThinkPads?

00:45:39.465 --> 00:45:41.199
- Mm-hmm.
- And that little nub. Right?

00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:43.100
Okay, so you just really
go after it like that.

00:45:43.101 --> 00:45:44.368
- Just like this. Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:45:44.369 --> 00:45:47.338
Right, so, uh, you have that
that's... that's phase three.

00:45:47.339 --> 00:45:49.841
- Mm-hmm.
- So, again, you know... Yeah, perfect.

00:45:49.842 --> 00:45:52.042
- Natural. Okay? Yeah, so tap the roof.
- I know.

00:45:52.043 --> 00:45:54.379
Mind the gap. Oh, see.
Okay, yeah. Work all three.

00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:56.413
- He's there.
- Look at that. It's like you're doing...

00:45:56.414 --> 00:45:58.015
- Right there.
- Oh boy, oh boy.

00:45:58.016 --> 00:46:01.118
It's like, I feel like
Anne Sullivan teaching

00:46:01.119 --> 00:46:03.154
Helen Keller about water and
everything else is amazing.

00:46:03.155 --> 00:46:04.321
- What a breakthrough!
- Mm-hmm.

00:46:04.322 --> 00:46:05.356
- Yeah, that's it.
- Like that?

00:46:05.357 --> 00:46:06.857
Yeah, you know, just take a night

00:46:06.858 --> 00:46:09.928
crack open a bottle of rose and...

00:46:09.929 --> 00:46:12.496
...just have multiple orgasms.

00:46:12.497 --> 00:46:15.590
If you want, you know... You know...

00:46:19.137 --> 00:46:21.506
Uh, primatologists actually
believed that... that

00:46:21.507 --> 00:46:26.111
women evolved this way so that, uh...

00:46:26.112 --> 00:46:29.435
...they could mate with as many
men in one session as possible.

00:46:30.483 --> 00:46:32.417
- Fucking awesome. You know that's...
- Yeah.

00:46:32.418 --> 00:46:36.154
- That's neat.
- Multiple orgasms for multiple partners, you know.

00:46:36.155 --> 00:46:38.256
Sure, yeah.

00:46:38.257 --> 00:46:41.124
Gang bangs, and such.

00:46:41.126 --> 00:46:42.616
Yeah.

00:46:44.963 --> 00:46:47.065
- I'm gonna go home.
- Yeah. Me too.

00:46:47.066 --> 00:46:48.899
- No, no. You live here.
- Yes I do!

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:49.934
- Okay.
- Bye!

00:46:49.935 --> 00:46:51.002
- Bye now.
- Thank you.

00:46:51.003 --> 00:46:52.493
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:55.273 --> 00:46:57.107
<i>I think... I think
it's a little bit weird</i>

00:46:57.108 --> 00:46:58.309
<i>that a straight dude had
to tell you all that.</i>

00:46:58.310 --> 00:47:00.511
I think it's sort of great.

00:47:00.512 --> 00:47:02.881
I mean, he's... he's actually
dating. He's not cheating.

00:47:02.882 --> 00:47:05.449
And I... and I hardly think
about Matthew. Like ever.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:07.352
Yeah, 'cause you're in a
relationship with each other.

00:47:07.353 --> 00:47:09.220
No, we're not.

00:47:09.221 --> 00:47:10.855
Oh, you're not out there!

00:47:10.856 --> 00:47:13.257
I mean, this Jake guy
is taking up emotional

00:47:13.258 --> 00:47:16.227
real estate that could be
occupied by a real option, okay?

00:47:16.228 --> 00:47:17.562
You leased the space out to Matthew.

00:47:17.563 --> 00:47:19.297
Rent free I might add.

00:47:19.298 --> 00:47:21.565
And now, you... you just
replaced him with another

00:47:21.566 --> 00:47:25.136
unavailable avoidant
breeder you don't fuck.

00:47:25.137 --> 00:47:28.172
- Like where's the fucking...
- Hey babe. Sorry, I'm late.

00:47:28.173 --> 00:47:29.540
Look at this little baby face.

00:47:29.541 --> 00:47:31.509
It's beautiful. Oh, my God.

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:33.244
Very sick in the head though.

00:47:33.245 --> 00:47:35.112
Very sick in the head.

00:47:35.113 --> 00:47:37.915
- How's your fake boyfriend?
- Oh, my God!

00:47:37.916 --> 00:47:40.885
- We're just friends!
- Men and women can't be friends.

00:47:40.886 --> 00:47:42.253
It's like life 101. Stop lying to yourself.

00:47:42.254 --> 00:47:45.323
Come one! That's bullshit.
It's the 21st century.

00:47:45.324 --> 00:47:47.591
We know that's not true.
You and I are friends.

00:47:47.592 --> 00:47:50.161
But sex doesn't get in
the way of our friendship.

00:47:50.162 --> 00:47:52.429
I'm not attracted to you.
And I have zero penises.

00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:55.365
- I am.
- Hi, George.

00:47:55.366 --> 00:47:57.435
- Hi, it's me. Your girlfriend.
- What? Oh!

00:47:57.436 --> 00:47:59.170
I like bad girls with daddy issues.

00:47:59.171 --> 00:48:00.971
She's 22, she'll fuck anyone.

00:48:00.972 --> 00:48:02.907
- Wait. I'm sorry, no.
- You know.

00:48:02.908 --> 00:48:05.999
Serious, she's probably fucked
everyone in here but I don't even care.

00:48:09.381 --> 00:48:11.116
You got a minute?

00:48:11.117 --> 00:48:13.906
Not really. I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

00:48:14.652 --> 00:48:17.021
- I was thinking.
- Oh, yeah?

00:48:17.022 --> 00:48:19.946
Do you wanna come to Henry's
birthday party this weekend?

00:48:20.658 --> 00:48:22.594
- Really?
- <i>Yep.</i>

00:48:22.595 --> 00:48:24.495
Xander, in the 8 years
I've known you as a father

00:48:24.496 --> 00:48:27.598
you have never once invited me to
any function involving your children.

00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:30.133
- Hear me out. I was thinking.
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

00:48:30.135 --> 00:48:32.202
Maybe you and Lainey...

00:48:32.203 --> 00:48:35.239
Ah, I knew it! No. See,
Lainey and I are not dating.

00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:37.641
I know that. I'm not
saying you have to date her.

00:48:37.642 --> 00:48:39.209
I'm not saying you have
to come as a couple.

00:48:39.210 --> 00:48:42.212
I'm just saying arrive
at the party together.

00:48:42.213 --> 00:48:44.549
Come as friends or whatever this
fucked up thing you guys have...

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:46.984
- We're... we're best friends.
- <i>No, we're best friends!</i>

00:48:46.985 --> 00:48:49.286
- That's not true.
- <i>What?</i>

00:48:49.287 --> 00:48:51.689
Look, she's my best friend and I would say

00:48:51.690 --> 00:48:53.691
by circumstance and certainly duration

00:48:53.692 --> 00:48:55.393
you would be my next best friend.

00:48:55.394 --> 00:48:57.995
Okay, you know what, I'll even allow that.

00:48:57.996 --> 00:49:02.000
- You're my last single friend, I can't have you...
- So what?

00:49:02.001 --> 00:49:03.100
- Hey.
- What are you talking about?

00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:05.536
- Yes.
- We have a meeting with group sales in 20.

00:49:05.537 --> 00:49:06.370
- Are you two prepared.
- Huh?

00:49:06.371 --> 00:49:07.604
Not at all.

00:49:07.605 --> 00:49:09.974
Should I reschedule the meeting

00:49:09.975 --> 00:49:11.643
when you are ready? 5 or 6 months from now?

00:49:11.644 --> 00:49:13.545
I would make it a cool 7.

00:49:13.546 --> 00:49:15.279
Yeah, 7 at least.

00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:18.049
Shit, I'm not available
then. Oh, well, I tried.

00:49:18.050 --> 00:49:19.484
See you in 20?

00:49:19.485 --> 00:49:21.084
You got it, boss.

00:49:21.085 --> 00:49:24.354
- Oh, yeah. Mousetrap
- What the fuck is that?

00:49:24.355 --> 00:49:27.424
- That was repartee.
- That's... that's exactly why I can't have you at the party.

00:49:27.425 --> 00:49:29.294
Because you have repartee with everybody.

00:49:29.295 --> 00:49:31.129
You love repartee.

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:33.330
All you want to do is flit around the party

00:49:33.331 --> 00:49:35.264
flirt with the moms.

00:49:35.265 --> 00:49:38.001
<i>And then they all get mad, and
then they turn on each other.</i>

00:49:38.002 --> 00:49:41.071
Then they yell at Naomi,
then Naomi yells at me.

00:49:41.072 --> 00:49:43.374
Then they won't let their
kids play with my kids.

00:49:43.375 --> 00:49:46.276
Then I have to play with my kids
because my kids have no friends.

00:49:46.277 --> 00:49:49.246
I'm raising friendless
children because of you.

00:49:49.247 --> 00:49:50.381
- Do you understand?
- <i>I...</i>

00:49:50.382 --> 00:49:54.017
It is a cascading shit
storm that is your creation.

00:49:54.018 --> 00:49:57.589
A tremendous amount of Malcolm
Gladwellian logic jumps.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:01.625
We'll you've spent 10,000
hours fucking my life up.

00:50:01.626 --> 00:50:04.129
- <i>So bring Lainey to the party.</i>
- Okay. Fine.

00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:07.197
I will, uh, you know, on
behalf of your children and...

00:50:07.198 --> 00:50:09.167
...and Naomi, I will, uh...

00:50:09.168 --> 00:50:10.335
I'll talk to Lainey and see what we can do.

00:50:10.336 --> 00:50:14.137
Listen, I'm not saying you
and Lainey need to date.

00:50:14.139 --> 00:50:16.540
I'm just saying, for the first time

00:50:16.541 --> 00:50:18.664
I'm a little bit optimistic...

00:50:19.412 --> 00:50:22.169
...you might not become that creepy guy.

00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.048
But he's got a point.

00:50:24.049 --> 00:50:26.149
I'm gonna be the creepy old dude!

00:50:26.151 --> 00:50:28.353
Like, that's sucks and then what happens

00:50:28.354 --> 00:50:30.522
when my dick doesn't get
as hard as it used to, okay.

00:50:30.523 --> 00:50:32.789
'Cause that's gonna happen. It's
gonna happen, it's inevitable.

00:50:32.791 --> 00:50:34.525
And... and young chicks
don't put up with that shit

00:50:34.526 --> 00:50:36.194
they have no time for that.

00:50:36.195 --> 00:50:38.295
And older women are gonna be

00:50:38.296 --> 00:50:40.597
no way near into my nonsense. Okay?

00:50:40.598 --> 00:50:42.567
Just not into it at all.

00:50:42.568 --> 00:50:44.201
It's... it's at that point, what do I do?

00:50:44.202 --> 00:50:46.404
I just buy the fedora
and move to Miami, right?

00:50:46.405 --> 00:50:48.138
Make a golf cart in my
own motor transportation.

00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:49.540
I've never seen you like this.
I... I... you're spinning.

00:50:49.541 --> 00:50:51.643
- I can't believe it. I mean...
- You're spinning, and honestly.

00:50:51.644 --> 00:50:52.743
Get... get lucky and... and happy about...

00:50:52.744 --> 00:50:53.610
Honestly you sound like a woman.

00:50:53.611 --> 00:50:54.578
You know, bachelor, bachelor parties

00:50:54.579 --> 00:50:57.147
for people third marriages. Like, that's...

00:50:57.148 --> 00:50:59.205
What... what is that? That's crazy.

00:51:00.151 --> 00:51:02.286
- It's him.
- Him who?

00:51:03.521 --> 00:51:05.156
He never calls. He always texts.

00:51:05.157 --> 00:51:06.622
Okay, no! Don't... don't answer that.

00:51:06.623 --> 00:51:07.591
- Jake! Jake!
- Don't answer it. No.

00:51:07.592 --> 00:51:09.093
- Give me the phone!
- No. Absolutely...

00:51:09.095 --> 00:51:09.962
Lainey, what are you doing?

00:51:09.963 --> 00:51:12.196
Hey, you don't do this anymore, okay?

00:51:12.197 --> 00:51:13.463
Remember? We're okay.

00:51:13.465 --> 00:51:14.433
I'm sorry, yeah.

00:51:14.434 --> 00:51:15.365
You got to breathe. Lainey, please breathe.

00:51:15.366 --> 00:51:17.733
- Is there a problem?
- What? Uh, yeah.

00:51:17.734 --> 00:51:19.504
My wife, she's prone to panic attacks.

00:51:19.505 --> 00:51:22.239
It's this guy she's sleeping
with. Uh, it's alright.

00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:25.176
Okay, it's... Hey dude get
the fuck out of here, I got it.

00:51:25.177 --> 00:51:26.478
- Oh, easy. Alright, alright.
- Okay? Thank you.

00:51:26.479 --> 00:51:30.315
I appreciate you concern,
Superman! Fly away.

00:51:30.316 --> 00:51:33.118
Baby, just breath, okay? Will you? Okay?

00:51:33.119 --> 00:51:34.886
Okay? Here. Come on, sit down.

00:51:34.887 --> 00:51:36.420
You're gonna be okay. It's alright.

00:51:36.421 --> 00:51:39.122
You just got to breathe. Please. Okay?

00:51:39.124 --> 00:51:40.891
Okay?

00:51:40.892 --> 00:51:43.261
Yeah. There you go.

00:51:43.262 --> 00:51:45.529
Lainey, this is just fear, alright?

00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:48.921
A really, really large dose of fear.

00:51:51.137 --> 00:51:52.669
That's all that's going on.

00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:54.671
A little adrenaline, in a bad way.

00:51:54.672 --> 00:51:56.697
Does that make sense?

00:51:58.408 --> 00:52:00.377
Also...

00:52:00.378 --> 00:52:02.346
...mousetrap.

00:52:02.347 --> 00:52:05.148
Complete and total mousetrap right now.

00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:08.386
- Oh, my God.
- Stop. You're so fucked up.

00:52:08.387 --> 00:52:10.254
I'm fucked up? What are you talking about?

00:52:10.255 --> 00:52:12.524
You... you went Kathy Bates in "Misery"

00:52:12.525 --> 00:52:13.590
in the middle of Central Park.

00:52:13.591 --> 00:52:16.493
You know... come on.
Maybe we're both fucked up.

00:52:16.494 --> 00:52:18.663
At least give me that. Come
on. You wanna get out of here?

00:52:18.664 --> 00:52:21.165
Yeah, Central Park sucks.

00:52:21.166 --> 00:52:23.835
No, it's... I mean, it's just
a goddamn bird toilet anyway.

00:52:23.836 --> 00:52:25.636
You know, it's... ugh!

00:52:25.637 --> 00:52:28.929
Almost done. Just one more.

00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:36.381
<i>This is the greatest
movie ever made.</i>

00:52:36.382 --> 00:52:37.681
Yeah, of course you love it.

00:52:37.682 --> 00:52:39.683
- Look at her.
- <i>God I love you.</i>

00:52:39.684 --> 00:52:41.286
That's you, baby.

00:52:41.287 --> 00:52:44.111
I love you! I'm gonna
murder you while I love you.

00:52:45.423 --> 00:52:47.192
That's the second time you said that. Hmm.

00:52:47.193 --> 00:52:48.348
Said what?

00:52:49.295 --> 00:52:50.894
You called me baby just now.

00:52:50.895 --> 00:52:53.864
And you said it the other day too.

00:52:53.865 --> 00:52:55.465
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

00:52:55.467 --> 00:52:56.868
No, I mean, it was a total accident.

00:52:56.869 --> 00:52:57.901
- I don't...
- That's okay.

00:52:57.902 --> 00:53:00.360
- I don't know why I would...
- Oh.

00:53:01.307 --> 00:53:03.363
- Yeah.
- Oh.

00:53:14.353 --> 00:53:16.410
Do you want talk about it?

00:53:19.325 --> 00:53:20.747
Talk about what?

00:53:22.260 --> 00:53:25.317
We're not a couple bur we act like one.

00:53:31.436 --> 00:53:32.669
Yeah.

00:53:32.670 --> 00:53:35.295
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...

00:53:36.874 --> 00:53:38.375
I mean, I guess I've been...

00:53:38.376 --> 00:53:39.877
...putting this
conversation off for a while.

00:53:39.878 --> 00:53:41.745
- We don't have to...
- No. No. No. It's good.

00:53:41.746 --> 00:53:44.004
It's good. We should. Um...

00:53:46.552 --> 00:53:49.042
Um, okay, well...

00:53:50.856 --> 00:53:53.457
You take this risk...

00:53:53.458 --> 00:53:55.425
...when you start sleeping with people.

00:53:55.426 --> 00:53:57.327
You know, you, uh...

00:53:57.328 --> 00:53:59.796
...you risk losing them, right?

00:53:59.798 --> 00:54:02.466
For me, I... you know, I've...
never slept with someone

00:54:02.467 --> 00:54:04.457
I wasn't willing to lose.

00:54:06.603 --> 00:54:09.029
Except one time.

00:54:10.008 --> 00:54:11.832
And, um...

00:54:13.512 --> 00:54:18.049
And it... kills me that you're
probably gonna go to Michigan.

00:54:18.050 --> 00:54:19.983
And it kills me that
I can't ask you to stay

00:54:19.984 --> 00:54:22.687
because I have no right
to, you know, and...

00:54:22.688 --> 00:54:24.388
Oh.

00:54:24.389 --> 00:54:26.857
So I just want to ...spend as much time

00:54:26.858 --> 00:54:29.951
with my best friend as I possibly can.

00:54:30.895 --> 00:54:33.453
Before I lose her again.

00:54:36.869 --> 00:54:38.803
I'm sorry. I'm being
selfish. I know it's like...

00:54:38.804 --> 00:54:41.329
No. You're telling the truth.

00:54:43.007 --> 00:54:45.642

00:55:53.679 --> 00:55:56.147

- It's you're birthday!

00:55:59.584 --> 00:56:01.386
Actually, it's, uh, it's Henry's.

00:56:01.387 --> 00:56:03.687
- He's seven. She's not seven.
- Oh.

00:56:03.688 --> 00:56:05.056
But, you know, I'm so
happy you guys are here.

00:56:05.057 --> 00:56:08.593
Oh, my God. Are you guys high?

00:56:08.594 --> 00:56:10.894
- We're actually rolling.
- Ecstasy?

00:56:10.895 --> 00:56:12.995
You know, that's how
actually Henry was conceived.

00:56:12.996 --> 00:56:14.498
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

00:56:14.499 --> 00:56:16.033
- Well that explains a lot.
- Full circle.

00:56:16.034 --> 00:56:18.001
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Don't have a baby, guys.

00:56:18.002 --> 00:56:20.670
No offense, but seriously, just...

00:56:20.671 --> 00:56:22.138
- Yeah.
- Be safe. You know what I mean.

00:56:22.139 --> 00:56:25.008
- But I'm so happy you guys are here. Okay.
- It's so good to see you.

00:56:25.009 --> 00:56:27.044
Oh, transformers guy didn't show up...

00:56:27.045 --> 00:56:29.679
- Are you kidding?
- No, no, no. Oh, my God.

00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:31.315
- Just kidding. No. Okay.
- It feels soft and smooth.

00:56:31.316 --> 00:56:34.185
No, and so there's a little bit of a
meltdown. It's a little bit of a crisis.

00:56:34.186 --> 00:56:35.986
- Hey, here you go.
- Oh, is this for Henry?

00:56:35.987 --> 00:56:37.621
- Yeah.
- Oh, great.

00:56:37.622 --> 00:56:39.690
He loves New York ladies flip flops.

00:56:39.691 --> 00:56:41.426
Oh, no, no, no. Those are mine.
Those are for me. Those are me.

00:56:41.427 --> 00:56:42.127
Sorry, that shouldn't be in there.

00:56:42.128 --> 00:56:42.960
It's just a shitload of candy.

00:56:42.961 --> 00:56:45.562
Great. Okay. Um, that'll be nice.

00:56:45.563 --> 00:56:47.998
- Are those hot pads also for Henry?
- Yes.

00:56:47.999 --> 00:56:50.133
- Okay.
- Can I just hold them now?

00:56:50.135 --> 00:56:51.767
Sure. Okay, come in.

00:56:51.768 --> 00:56:55.137
<i>Okay, hopefully she

Naomi, put on track 7 on my workout mix.

00:57:30.742 --> 00:57:32.743
Wait. Hey, Lainey. You...
you don't have to do this.

00:57:32.744 --> 00:57:34.610
It's not your responsibility.

00:57:34.611 --> 00:57:37.848
Okay, relax. I do this for a living.

00:57:37.849 --> 00:57:40.116
Also, 2 minutes ago, I accepted

00:57:40.117 --> 00:57:42.486

- No, deals with kids.

00:57:47.825 --> 00:57:49.992
She told me to relax, and the word lasted

00:57:49.993 --> 00:57:52.017
for like 4 seconds.

00:57:52.831 --> 00:57:54.264

Oh, wow, that's weird.

01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:19.743

01:00:26.783 --> 01:00:30.286
Ah, hi, you two. Are you guys married?

01:00:30.287 --> 01:00:33.757
This is my son, and he really liked
dancing with you. Didn't you, buddy?

01:00:33.758 --> 01:00:36.027
Dude, are you really using
your kid to hit on my friend?

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:38.094
Shut up. Ignore him. He's on drugs.

01:00:38.095 --> 01:00:40.297
Paul, nice to meet you.

01:00:40.298 --> 01:00:42.899
We're headin' out. But here's my info.

In case you feel like you might need it.

01:00:45.003 --> 01:00:46.837
Come on, buddy. You can drive.

01:00:46.838 --> 01:00:49.272
Oh, boy, "In case you might need it?"

01:00:49.273 --> 01:00:51.974
Why would you need his info?

01:00:51.975 --> 01:00:54.343
You're jealous.

01:00:54.344 --> 01:00:56.112
I'm going to assume it's
because you're coming down

01:00:56.113 --> 01:00:57.713
off a powerful drug.

01:00:57.714 --> 01:00:59.149
First part, false. Second part, true.

01:00:59.150 --> 01:01:00.750
"Chris Smith."

01:01:00.751 --> 01:01:02.053
Hold on. What?

01:01:02.054 --> 01:01:04.689
His name's Chris Smith?

01:01:04.690 --> 01:01:06.323
It is?

01:01:06.324 --> 01:01:09.160

01:01:10.429 --> 01:01:13.262
- No.

01:01:13.263 --> 01:01:15.199
I always thought he'd
be heavier with a beard.

01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:17.333
- Leave him alone.
- I love it. It's great.

01:01:17.334 --> 01:01:18.868
Okay, I'm gonna try it again, alright?

01:01:18.869 --> 01:01:20.369
Just see if any of the water goes down.

01:01:20.370 --> 01:01:22.794
I'm gonna see how much
I can drink. Here we go.

01:01:27.878 --> 01:01:30.448
I love those "Rush
Hour" movies. Oh, my God.

01:01:30.449 --> 01:01:32.749
Anything that African American guy says

01:01:32.750 --> 01:01:34.317
anything at all and I'm laughing, you know.

01:01:34.318 --> 01:01:37.087
Hmm. Mm-hmm. Yeah.

01:01:37.088 --> 01:01:40.389
- Shit, that was dumb.
- No, Chris. It's fine.

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.392
They're great. They're such good movies.

01:01:42.393 --> 01:01:44.462
I was married for 8 years.

01:01:44.463 --> 01:01:48.755
And I just... I haven't
done this in a while.

01:01:49.367 --> 01:01:51.658
Me neither.

01:01:52.804 --> 01:01:54.137
Are you okay?

01:01:54.139 --> 01:01:56.806
Yeah. Yeah.

01:02:05.117 --> 01:02:06.605
Yeah.

01:02:07.284 --> 01:02:09.942
Be rude to it.

01:02:14.159 --> 01:02:15.648
Yeah.

01:02:24.168 --> 01:02:26.792
That was ridiculous.

01:02:28.907 --> 01:02:32.109
The Dirty DJ was our thing, okay?

01:02:32.110 --> 01:02:33.277
- Jake.
- That was our thing.

01:02:33.278 --> 01:02:35.111
Okay, let me be super clear here.

01:02:35.112 --> 01:02:36.547
Mm-hmm. Please.

01:02:36.548 --> 01:02:39.482
We don't have things that are sexual.

01:02:39.483 --> 01:02:44.053
We don't sleep with each
other, so we don't have things.

01:02:44.054 --> 01:02:46.790
Okay, but you know what I mean, alright?

01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:49.258
I taught you that as a gift to you.

01:02:49.259 --> 01:02:52.562
That was not a Chris Smith gift, okay?

01:02:52.563 --> 01:02:54.531
So. I don't get mad when you bring
other chicks to our restaurant.

01:02:54.532 --> 01:02:56.500
- Our restaurant?
- Yes.

01:02:56.501 --> 01:02:59.102
Oh, thank you. Yeah. Our restaurant?

01:02:59.103 --> 01:03:01.003
I didn't know we put a
down payment on this place.

01:03:01.004 --> 01:03:02.372
Come on.

01:03:02.373 --> 01:03:04.040
You know, I love it that you get ownership

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:06.210
over a randomly selected dumpling spot

01:03:06.211 --> 01:03:09.845
but me, I can't share with you
the slightest disappointment

01:03:09.847 --> 01:03:11.481
over you co-opting an
original idea of mine.

01:03:11.483 --> 01:03:12.515
- Co... Okay.
- Yeah.

01:03:12.516 --> 01:03:13.550
First of all, you are not

01:03:13.551 --> 01:03:15.552
the Mark Zuckerberg of vaginas.

01:03:15.553 --> 01:03:16.620
I don't know who that is.

01:03:16.621 --> 01:03:20.591
And secondly, do not
gaslight me with SAT words

01:03:20.592 --> 01:03:22.559
and sliding scale morality.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:24.361
- I'm not one of your dates.
- That is very true.

01:03:24.362 --> 01:03:25.596
No. You are not one of my dates.

01:03:25.597 --> 01:03:26.596
- And I'm glad. Thank you.
- Some water.

01:03:26.597 --> 01:03:27.832
- No, the lady doesn't need it.
- Excuse me.

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:29.566
- She doesn't deserve that.
- I would like that, please.

01:03:29.567 --> 01:03:30.600
I actually would like the water.

01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:32.870
Sir, I-I can't stress enough

01:03:32.871 --> 01:03:34.103
if we give her water I
don't know what happens.

01:03:34.104 --> 01:03:35.037
You need to give me this water.

01:03:35.038 --> 01:03:37.540
See she's addicted. This is an addict.

01:03:37.541 --> 01:03:39.575
This is... I've seen it
a hundred times with her.

01:03:39.576 --> 01:03:41.410
You gotta trust me.

01:03:41.411 --> 01:03:43.112
You have lost your mind.

01:03:43.113 --> 01:03:46.015
Well, you have lost your water.

01:03:46.016 --> 01:03:49.074
So... I guess we're tied.

01:03:50.487 --> 01:03:52.890
I wanna be able to talk
you about this kinda thing.

01:03:52.891 --> 01:03:55.192
I sense that. That's obvious.
I just don't know why.

01:03:55.193 --> 01:03:57.361
You talk to me about chicks
you screw all the time.

01:03:57.362 --> 01:03:59.618
That's different.

01:04:00.964 --> 01:04:03.033
- Why?
- 'Cause I'm going inside them.

01:04:03.034 --> 01:04:04.368
This you're talking
about someone inside you

01:04:04.369 --> 01:04:05.902
that's just... ugh!

01:04:05.903 --> 01:04:06.993
- Duh.
- Grody.

01:04:09.474 --> 01:04:13.175
This is the Bieder contract that
has to go to legal for comments.

01:04:13.177 --> 01:04:15.545
Knock knock. Hey, you got a minute?

01:04:15.546 --> 01:04:19.149
Um... Ah, I mean... real minute?

01:04:19.150 --> 01:04:20.349
A New York minute. I don't
know... yeah, a real minute.

01:04:20.350 --> 01:04:22.018
60 seconds. Sure.

01:04:22.019 --> 01:04:23.520
Okay.

01:04:23.521 --> 01:04:25.454
Um, what was the other thing?

01:04:25.455 --> 01:04:26.957
Oh, yeah, buzz me for the 3 o'clock.

01:04:26.958 --> 01:04:28.058
<i>And that's it. Okay.</i>

01:04:28.059 --> 01:04:30.083
Yeah, don't fuck that up.

01:04:30.561 --> 01:04:32.529
You got to let them have it.

01:04:32.530 --> 01:04:34.964
Hey, will you, uh, sign this for me please?

01:04:34.965 --> 01:04:36.265
Well, I have to know what it is first.

01:04:36.266 --> 01:04:38.935
Oh, it's a nullification of my contract.

01:04:38.936 --> 01:04:43.472
It says I resign and forfeit any
vesting stock options to Xander.

01:04:43.473 --> 01:04:46.410
And why would you do that?

01:04:46.411 --> 01:04:49.078
Oh, right, no. Because I
want to go on a date with you.

01:04:49.079 --> 01:04:52.648
Silly. Uh, if you can just
sign the back here. 3 places.

01:04:52.649 --> 01:04:54.117
You can use my pen if you'd like.

01:04:54.119 --> 01:04:57.254
And as you can see I've
executed my half, so...

01:04:57.255 --> 01:05:00.023
You stand to make over $5
million in the next 2 years.

01:05:00.024 --> 01:05:03.492
No shit? Wow! That's great.

01:05:03.494 --> 01:05:05.494
Uh, but I mean I never really factor

01:05:05.496 --> 01:05:07.598
money in my decision making, so...

01:05:07.599 --> 01:05:09.032
...it doesn't change what I'm doing.

01:05:09.033 --> 01:05:10.234
I appreciate the hardball

01:05:10.235 --> 01:05:13.569
but obviously I can't take a
request like this seriously.

01:05:13.570 --> 01:05:14.671
But the seriousness of my request

01:05:14.672 --> 01:05:17.207
is reflected in the hardball.

01:05:17.208 --> 01:05:20.098
So I don't... I don't know what to do here.

01:05:24.081 --> 01:05:25.314
Okay. I'll go on one date with you

01:05:25.315 --> 01:05:27.250
if you answer a question truthfully.

01:05:27.251 --> 01:05:29.085
Get the spanks. I love it. Yeah.

01:05:29.086 --> 01:05:32.689
I answer all questions
truthfully, but fire away.

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:36.959
What on earth makes you think
that I'm worth $5 million?

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.652
What makes you think you're not?

01:05:44.635 --> 01:05:46.236
Get outta here. Get back to work.

01:05:46.237 --> 01:05:47.471
- I'm on break.
- So take this...

01:05:47.472 --> 01:05:49.506
- I'm on break.
- ...and get out of my office.

01:05:49.507 --> 01:05:51.096
Okay.

01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:54.066
Alright. To be continued.

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.768
TTFN.

01:05:57.514 --> 01:06:00.283
<i>Um, you know, I mean...</i>

01:06:00.284 --> 01:06:02.051
Ta-ta for now.

01:06:02.052 --> 01:06:05.022
My ex has my son this weekend.

01:06:05.023 --> 01:06:07.491
And I know a place with cheap tequila.

01:06:07.492 --> 01:06:09.692
We should go there. That sounds great.

01:06:09.693 --> 01:06:12.129
Can you keep your mouth shut?

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:14.363
Yeah. I mean, not once we get there.

01:06:14.364 --> 01:06:16.099
Tequila makes me so chatty.

01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.067
In a good way I think.

01:06:18.068 --> 01:06:20.536
- You mean out here.
- <i>Just... Yes, mouth shut, please.</i>

01:06:20.537 --> 01:06:23.129
- Not gonna say a peep.
- Get outta here!

01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:27.642
Back to work, you.

01:06:27.643 --> 01:06:29.134
<i>Yes!</i>

01:06:31.782 --> 01:06:34.017
<i>There you are.</i>

01:06:34.018 --> 01:06:35.786
Hey, thanks for comin', Lainey.

01:06:35.787 --> 01:06:38.653
Partners always have to
do these bullshit events.

01:06:38.654 --> 01:06:40.122
I hope your heels are comfortable

01:06:40.123 --> 01:06:41.023
'cause you're gonna be standing

01:06:41.024 --> 01:06:43.460
and talking to boring people all night.

01:06:43.461 --> 01:06:45.462
Chris, I'm having a great time.

01:06:45.463 --> 01:06:47.330
Thank you for inviting me.

01:06:47.331 --> 01:06:49.888
And these shoes are still uncomfortable.

01:06:51.536 --> 01:06:53.024
<i>Elaine?</i>

01:06:53.438 --> 01:06:55.071
Hi, Matthew.

01:06:55.072 --> 01:06:57.506
- Good to see you.
- This is Chris.

01:06:57.508 --> 01:06:59.508
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, Matthew.

01:06:59.510 --> 01:07:02.111
Matthew and I were at
Columbia around the same time.

01:07:02.112 --> 01:07:05.148
Oh. Your name is Elaine?

01:07:05.150 --> 01:07:07.718
- Lainey is a nickname.
- I didn't know that.

01:07:07.719 --> 01:07:11.120
Oh, Elaine, you've never
met my wife, have you?

01:07:11.121 --> 01:07:13.257
- I haven't.
- Let me introduce you. Emma?

01:07:13.258 --> 01:07:16.292
- Come here.
- Excuse me.

01:07:16.293 --> 01:07:17.728
This is Elaine.

01:07:17.729 --> 01:07:19.462
So nice to meet you, Emma.

01:07:19.463 --> 01:07:20.663
- This is Chris.
- Hi.

01:07:20.664 --> 01:07:22.598
- Hi.
- When are you due?

01:07:22.599 --> 01:07:25.201
- October.
- Congratulations.

01:07:25.202 --> 01:07:27.603
- Your first?
- Yes. It's a boy.

01:07:27.604 --> 01:07:30.306
We're so excited.

01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:31.574
Matthew will be delivering him.

01:07:31.575 --> 01:07:33.643
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:07:33.644 --> 01:07:35.678
- OB-GYN?
- Yes. You?

01:07:35.679 --> 01:07:37.480
Uh, partner over at Garrison and Shingle.

01:07:37.481 --> 01:07:39.415
- A man of the law.
- Yeah.

01:07:39.416 --> 01:07:41.150
I've worked with you
guys when I was a mediator

01:07:41.151 --> 01:07:42.518
on Thorpe V. Bronwin.

01:07:42.519 --> 01:07:45.121
- Sure.
- Elaine, what is it that you do?

01:07:45.122 --> 01:07:46.456
- I teach kindergarten.
- That's right.

01:07:46.458 --> 01:07:48.356
I think I knew that.

01:07:48.357 --> 01:07:50.818
Would you excuse me? I'm just
gonna run to the ladies' room.

01:07:57.401 --> 01:07:58.435
<i>Okay, can I cut to the chase?</i>

01:07:58.436 --> 01:07:59.468
<i>I would love that.</i>

01:07:59.469 --> 01:08:00.836
I love cutting to chases. Do it.

01:08:00.838 --> 01:08:02.873
Okay, so you're a womanizer.

01:08:02.874 --> 01:08:04.474
Hey!

01:08:04.476 --> 01:08:05.343
How did you know that?

01:08:05.344 --> 01:08:07.210
- Everybody knows that.
- Everybody?

01:08:07.211 --> 01:08:09.178
Your interns call you a Jump Back Jake.

01:08:09.179 --> 01:08:10.279
- I have a nickname?
- A nickname.

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.515
- That's how bad it is.
- Wow!

01:08:11.516 --> 01:08:13.350
It's not bad. I...

01:08:13.351 --> 01:08:14.317
Or that's how good it is!

01:08:14.318 --> 01:08:16.252
Right? Well, see, that's what I'm saying.

01:08:16.253 --> 01:08:17.453
I... I mean, I assumed
they would speak about me

01:08:17.454 --> 01:08:18.653
but I thought I was gonna be more along

01:08:18.654 --> 01:08:19.690
the lines of something like...

01:08:19.691 --> 01:08:21.558
- Stellar Yelp reviews?
- Yeah.

01:08:21.559 --> 01:08:22.525
Stellar Yelp reviews.

01:08:22.526 --> 01:08:25.796
- So can I ask?
- Yeah, how do I stop you?

01:08:25.797 --> 01:08:29.565
- Mmm.
- Were you a fat teenager?

01:08:29.566 --> 01:08:32.903
Did you... No, seriously, did you
not get along with your mother?

01:08:32.904 --> 01:08:35.304
Do you just... do you not like women?

01:08:35.305 --> 01:08:37.640
Do you feel suffocated
by them as soon as you...

01:08:37.641 --> 01:08:39.742
Yeah, I mean, no, it's
none of those things.

01:08:39.743 --> 01:08:41.577
God, those are all bad.

01:08:41.578 --> 01:08:43.835
No, I think it was...

01:08:45.617 --> 01:08:49.585
I think it was because I was
like a... like a late bloomer.

01:08:49.586 --> 01:08:50.720
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:53.857
- Me too.
- Mmm. Mm-hmm.

01:08:53.858 --> 01:08:55.626
That's amazing. No shit.

01:08:55.627 --> 01:08:57.493
I mean, it's different for women.

01:08:57.494 --> 01:08:59.618
I waited until my wedding night.

01:09:01.331 --> 01:09:03.266
Did you grow up in America?

01:09:03.267 --> 01:09:06.701
Holy shit! I don't think I've ever...

01:09:06.702 --> 01:09:08.437
No, I've never met anybody

01:09:08.438 --> 01:09:10.407
that actually waited
until their wedding day.

01:09:10.408 --> 01:09:12.643
That's like Bobby Fischer kind of scarcity.

01:09:12.644 --> 01:09:15.244
Okay, well I grew up
very, very religiously.

01:09:15.245 --> 01:09:18.180
- What is your excuse?
- Hmm.

01:09:18.182 --> 01:09:20.951
Yeah, my excuse, well, I think it's a...

01:09:20.952 --> 01:09:25.353
I... I thought it was something
that should be special.

01:09:25.354 --> 01:09:27.890
I think I literally sprouted...

01:09:27.891 --> 01:09:30.294
...a vagina when I said that.

01:09:30.295 --> 01:09:31.327
Check, please.

01:09:31.328 --> 01:09:32.496
There's a Georgia O'Keeffe

01:09:32.497 --> 01:09:34.398
painting in my pants as we speak.

01:09:34.399 --> 01:09:37.233
- There are worse things.
- That's true.

01:09:37.234 --> 01:09:38.801
Pollock. Ooh.

01:09:41.837 --> 01:09:43.940
Yeah, but that was that...
that's why I... I, yeah.

01:09:43.941 --> 01:09:45.374
I mean, I had a bunch of
friends that had done it

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:47.476
and it just... I don't know.

01:09:47.477 --> 01:09:50.313
At some point I realized
it wasn't gonna be special

01:09:50.314 --> 01:09:51.914
and so I just wanted to get it over with

01:09:51.915 --> 01:09:55.140
and it's never been special ever since.

01:09:55.919 --> 01:09:58.555
- So who was the girl?
- Hmm.

01:09:58.556 --> 01:09:59.590
Do you remember?

01:10:01.792 --> 01:10:03.527
- You need to get that?
- Nope.

01:10:03.528 --> 01:10:05.595
- Please.
- No, no, no. It's just a friend.

01:10:05.596 --> 01:10:07.230
Well, you can still get the phone.

01:10:07.231 --> 01:10:08.166
- I don't wanna get the phone.
- Okay.

01:10:08.167 --> 01:10:10.122
It's just a friend. It's no big deal.

01:10:11.868 --> 01:10:14.926
<i>Your call has been forwarded
to an automatic voice...</i>

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:32.755
Are you one of Matthew's patients?

01:10:32.756 --> 01:10:35.259
No. I went to Columbia.

01:10:35.260 --> 01:10:38.394
I'm surprised Matthew hasn't mentioned you.

01:10:38.395 --> 01:10:41.120
Well, I haven't seen him in a long time.

01:10:42.667 --> 01:10:46.303
It shouldn't bother me but I
don't like meeting his patients.

01:10:46.304 --> 01:10:49.428
It's so weird meeting someone
when your husband has seen her...

01:10:49.873 --> 01:10:51.973
You know...

01:10:51.974 --> 01:10:55.233
Of course. Yeah, I'd feel the same way.

01:10:59.917 --> 01:11:02.885
Lainey, everything okay?

01:11:02.886 --> 01:11:04.620
Oh, I gotta go. Chris,
I'm so sorry I'm leaving.

01:11:04.621 --> 01:11:06.290
I'm... I'm sick.

01:11:06.291 --> 01:11:07.590
Oh, no. Well, let me...
let me drive you home.

01:11:07.591 --> 01:11:10.661
- No. Please...
- Is everything alright?

01:11:10.662 --> 01:11:11.994
I'm just not feeling well.

01:11:11.995 --> 01:11:15.032
Oh. We should take our driver.

01:11:15.033 --> 01:11:17.732
Emma and I are gonna stick
around for another hour or so.

01:11:17.733 --> 01:11:20.835
But he can drop you off and
be back in 20 minutes. Easy.

01:11:20.836 --> 01:11:22.470
You don't know where I live.

01:11:22.471 --> 01:11:24.573
That's so nice. Are you sure?

01:11:24.574 --> 01:11:26.076
Yeah. She'll never get
a cab out at this hour.

01:11:26.077 --> 01:11:27.877
It's no trouble.

01:11:27.878 --> 01:11:29.078
Look, I'm really supposed to mingle a bit

01:11:29.079 --> 01:11:30.013
but if you want me to come...

01:11:30.014 --> 01:11:31.982
No, it's fine. I'll call you tomorrow.

01:11:31.983 --> 01:11:32.949
Okay.

01:11:32.950 --> 01:11:35.483
Oh yeah, yeah. You're sick. Feel better.

01:11:35.484 --> 01:11:38.009
Bye, Chris. Thank you so much for tonight.

01:11:38.989 --> 01:11:41.347
It's no trouble. Thank you.

01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:45.429
So it's the black town car.
It's across the street...

01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:47.096
I know what your car looks
like. I don't need it.

01:11:47.097 --> 01:11:48.898
I like your date. He seems nice.

01:11:48.899 --> 01:11:51.934
- Fuck you, Matt.
- Why haven't you returned any of my calls?

01:11:51.935 --> 01:11:53.470
- I blocked your number.
- Why?

01:11:53.471 --> 01:11:55.504
Because I'm not an asshole.

01:11:55.506 --> 01:11:57.096
Okay.

01:12:07.951 --> 01:12:09.353
Uh-huh. No, no.

01:12:09.354 --> 01:12:11.488
What? What?

01:12:11.489 --> 01:12:13.045
You're so greedy.

01:12:15.791 --> 01:12:17.928
- Uh-huh.
- What? What do you want me to do?

01:12:17.929 --> 01:12:20.486
I want you to do nothing.

01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:24.634
I want you to do exactly

01:12:24.635 --> 01:12:27.426
what you don't normally do.

01:12:28.038 --> 01:12:30.428

Yes.

<i>It's right here on the right side.</i>

01:14:45.742 --> 01:14:47.099
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:15:03.627 --> 01:15:05.719
I just tried calling you.

01:15:06.697 --> 01:15:09.054
- My phone died.
- Hmm.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.725
So how was your day?

01:15:14.005 --> 01:15:15.626
Swell.

01:15:17.807 --> 01:15:20.099
Want to come up?

01:16:43.094 --> 01:16:45.126
- It's over.
- Hmm.

01:16:45.127 --> 01:16:47.997
He didn't choose me.

01:16:47.998 --> 01:16:51.322
You never told him to
make a choice, you know.

01:16:56.106 --> 01:16:58.563
How was Paula?

01:16:59.010 --> 01:17:00.733
Hmm.

01:17:03.046 --> 01:17:05.304
I was a mess.

01:17:07.385 --> 01:17:09.875
She nice to you?

01:17:11.955 --> 01:17:13.612
Yes.

01:17:15.324 --> 01:17:17.816
- Good.
- Hmm.

01:17:35.077 --> 01:17:37.335
What's up?

01:17:38.447 --> 01:17:41.606
Are we in love with each other?

01:17:54.297 --> 01:17:56.721
What are we gonna do about it?

01:18:05.443 --> 01:18:07.933
What do you wanna do?

01:18:10.948 --> 01:18:12.471
Nothing.

01:18:16.252 --> 01:18:18.876
There's nothing to do.

01:18:25.195 --> 01:18:27.951
I love you for free, Lainey.

01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:34.203
I love you for free, Jake.

01:19:27.090 --> 01:19:30.926
I guess I can't talk you
into a road trip to Ann Arbor?

01:19:30.927 --> 01:19:33.328
Tempting. Tempting, but no.

01:19:33.329 --> 01:19:35.297
Paula and I are taking
Oliver upstate tomorrow.

01:19:35.298 --> 01:19:37.065
Hmm.

01:19:37.066 --> 01:19:38.968
Do you want me to grab
the rest of the boxes?

01:19:38.969 --> 01:19:41.003
No, Kara and George are
shipping it to me on Monday.

01:19:41.004 --> 01:19:43.839
- Cool. Alright.
- I'm good. I'm good.

01:19:43.841 --> 01:19:46.074
- You got it all figured out.
- Yeah.

01:19:46.075 --> 01:19:48.844
Alright, well...

01:19:48.846 --> 01:19:50.313
...last chance to ditch med school

01:19:50.314 --> 01:19:51.413
and run away with me, huh?

01:19:51.414 --> 01:19:53.183
Come on, what do you say? Let's go.

01:19:53.184 --> 01:19:56.051
You just sneak in here,
I'll drive. Bounce around.

01:19:56.052 --> 01:19:58.853
You know, unfortunately
I don't sleep with men

01:19:58.854 --> 01:20:00.556
in relationships anymore.

01:20:00.557 --> 01:20:02.491
- This new crazy thing.
- Gotcha.

01:20:02.493 --> 01:20:04.227
No, that's okay. That's okay.

01:20:04.228 --> 01:20:05.327
I stopped cheating anyway.

01:20:05.328 --> 01:20:08.786
So, bad timing. What happened to us?

01:20:10.066 --> 01:20:12.100
We're getting a chance to start over.

01:20:12.101 --> 01:20:13.569
That's true.

01:20:13.570 --> 01:20:15.604
- Just in time...
- Oh, yeah.

01:20:15.605 --> 01:20:16.605
- If you ask me.
- Oh, yeah.

01:20:16.606 --> 01:20:19.665
Yeah, before things got
really bad, and weird.

01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:27.950
Alright, well, goodbye forever.

01:20:27.951 --> 01:20:30.776
Goodbye forever. Again.

01:20:32.189 --> 01:20:35.447
Up top. There you go. Yup.

01:20:41.398 --> 01:20:43.756
Thank you, Jake.

01:20:44.901 --> 01:20:46.658
For what?

01:20:48.605 --> 01:20:51.897
For teaching me how to love someone.

01:20:55.112 --> 01:20:57.001
Anytime.

01:21:00.917 --> 01:21:02.919
I'll get this for you,
you've got to close this.

01:21:02.920 --> 01:21:04.009
Yep.

01:21:06.590 --> 01:21:09.925
It would be kinda cool though if
you could just hang onto the back.

01:21:09.926 --> 01:21:12.528

Uh, alright, drive safe.

- Yeah?
- Hmm.

orange slices after a game.

Thank you. That's like
$400 worth of frozen yogurt.

01:22:36.446 --> 01:22:39.282
- Holy toppings!
- She just said it's every topping.

01:22:39.283 --> 01:22:41.416

- What do you say?

01:22:53.197 --> 01:22:55.130
Alright. I'll allow it.

01:23:00.304 --> 01:23:02.270
Yeah, 'cause that's... 'cause
that's what kids wanna do.

01:23:02.271 --> 01:23:03.305
They don't want to go swimming.

01:23:03.306 --> 01:23:04.773
They want to go to brunch.

01:23:04.774 --> 01:23:06.274
Thanks, Jake.

01:23:06.275 --> 01:23:08.165
There you go.

01:23:09.279 --> 01:23:11.346
<i>You have really changed, my friend.</i>

01:23:11.347 --> 01:23:14.082
- <i>Yes.</i>
- I have to say, I don't mind it.

01:23:14.083 --> 01:23:15.083
I don't know what that whole thing

01:23:15.084 --> 01:23:17.353
was with Lainey but it
really turned you around

01:23:17.354 --> 01:23:19.678
in the right direction.

01:23:20.122 --> 01:23:21.756
How's she doin'?

01:23:21.757 --> 01:23:24.359
- Lainey?
- Yeah.

01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:27.152
I don't know. We haven't talked in a while.

01:23:29.298 --> 01:23:33.603
Look at her, passing
out toppings like, uh...

01:23:33.604 --> 01:23:35.337
She's just like a dealer.

01:23:35.338 --> 01:23:37.039
- What?
- <i>You're mad?</i>

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.373
- No, but are you...
- <i>You're happy.</i>

01:23:38.374 --> 01:23:39.774
- <i>You're both?</i>
- You're crazy.

01:23:39.775 --> 01:23:40.644
Are you mappy? You're mappy?

01:23:40.645 --> 01:23:42.411
I'm just gonna say you're mappy.

01:23:42.412 --> 01:23:43.546
- I can't...
- Have you thought this through?

01:23:43.547 --> 01:23:44.480
- I know it's a birthday gift.
- I can't go to France.

01:23:44.481 --> 01:23:45.414
- <i>Okay.</i>
- I can't take off work.

01:23:45.415 --> 01:23:47.716
'Cause I'm pretty sure there's gonna be

01:23:47.717 --> 01:23:50.752
a very nice suite in a 5 star
hotel just waiting for ya.

01:23:50.753 --> 01:23:53.221
<i>But you're right. It's a bad
idea. Maybe you shouldn't go.</i>

01:23:53.222 --> 01:23:55.424
But I've got to find someone
now with your exact name

01:23:55.425 --> 01:23:58.094
that can go to Europe and use that room.

01:23:58.095 --> 01:24:00.729
- Anybody here named Paula?
- Shh.

01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:02.665
- You're crazy.
- Settle down, people.

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:03.799
- No, not at all.
- Are you kidding?

01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:05.535
I think this is a great idea.

01:24:05.536 --> 01:24:07.502
When did you get this good?

01:24:07.503 --> 01:24:10.161
I spent a long time being bad.

01:24:12.242 --> 01:24:14.676
I just... I mean. I just... just...

01:24:17.247 --> 01:24:18.648
What?

01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:22.041
Uh, I'm sorry, I just...

01:24:23.153 --> 01:24:25.254
<i>I know this guy from somewhere.</i>

01:24:25.255 --> 01:24:27.722
- With the glasses.
- <i>I can't put my finger on it.</i>

01:24:27.723 --> 01:24:29.980
- From work?
- No.

01:24:32.261 --> 01:24:35.264
- Your neighbor?
- No, I...

01:24:35.265 --> 01:24:37.098
I feel like he had longer hair.

01:24:37.099 --> 01:24:39.501
Maybe he's an actor?

01:24:39.502 --> 01:24:42.026
Maybe I knew him at Colum...

01:24:42.806 --> 01:24:44.296
Columbia.

01:24:48.444 --> 01:24:50.179
You know what? I'm...
I'm... You mind if I run

01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.346
over there just to see if it's him?

01:24:51.347 --> 01:24:53.181
- Okay, baby.
- <i>Alright.</i>

01:24:53.182 --> 01:24:55.240
Be right back.

01:24:58.287 --> 01:25:00.312
Well, we can talk about it.

01:25:01.190 --> 01:25:02.680
Sobvechik?

01:25:03.594 --> 01:25:05.083
Yeah.

01:25:06.730 --> 01:25:09.088
- Oh, you're pregnant.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:25:19.909 --> 01:25:22.267
You boring, fuckin', asshole!

01:25:24.213 --> 01:25:25.870
Sorry, sorry.

01:25:27.917 --> 01:25:31.220
Hey! Hey! Jake!

01:25:31.221 --> 01:25:33.456
Somebody do something.

01:25:33.457 --> 01:25:35.947
- Jake, Jake!
- That's for my girl, you shit!

01:25:36.425 --> 01:25:38.183
Fuck you!

01:25:38.794 --> 01:25:41.287
Come on. Get up! Come on.

01:25:42.899 --> 01:25:45.268
You fucking boring piece of shit!

01:25:45.269 --> 01:25:47.325
<i>Fucking tourist.</i>

01:25:48.838 --> 01:25:50.305
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:25:57.813 --> 01:26:00.215
- Matthew, my water broke...
- Honey!

01:26:00.216 --> 01:26:01.650
<i>Honey!</i>

01:26:01.651 --> 01:26:03.952
- We need a doctor.
- I'm a doctor! I'm her doctor!

01:26:03.953 --> 01:26:05.755
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:26:05.756 --> 01:26:09.324
I am her husband. That is
my wife and that is my baby.

01:26:09.325 --> 01:26:11.726
And this motherfucker I don't even know...

01:26:11.727 --> 01:26:13.751
- Let's go!
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

01:26:13.931 --> 01:26:15.463
<i>Fucking maniac.</i>

01:26:15.464 --> 01:26:17.365
That's my husband! Oh, my God!

01:26:17.366 --> 01:26:19.602
- <i>Oh, my God!</i>
- No! No!

01:26:19.603 --> 01:26:23.737
♪ Well if you ever go ♪

01:26:23.738 --> 01:26:27.443
♪ Darlin' I'll be... ♪

01:26:27.444 --> 01:26:28.611
No!

01:26:28.612 --> 01:26:30.211
No!

01:26:30.213 --> 01:26:31.514
No!

01:26:31.515 --> 01:26:33.648
<i>Matthew! Hey! Hey!</i>

01:26:33.649 --> 01:26:35.218
He didn't do anything.

01:26:35.219 --> 01:26:36.419
We were just having brunch

01:26:36.420 --> 01:26:40.956
and then this fucker comes
out of nowhere and decks him!

01:26:40.957 --> 01:26:43.826
The Henley wearing bullshit motherfucker!

01:26:43.827 --> 01:26:46.528
<i>Oh, my God, this isn't
happening. I need a tissue.</i>

01:26:46.529 --> 01:26:48.318
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:58.129
Hey.

01:27:04.347 --> 01:27:06.282
They're gonna book you for assault.

01:27:06.283 --> 01:27:08.973
What? Why? What did I...

01:27:10.587 --> 01:27:12.911
Sorry, bad joke.

01:27:14.291 --> 01:27:15.790
So you're gonna need
someone to bail you out.

01:27:15.791 --> 01:27:18.384
Oh, come on. Paula...

01:27:20.463 --> 01:27:22.353
- I don't need a hardball...
- My girl?

01:27:22.797 --> 01:27:24.322
What?

01:27:25.434 --> 01:27:28.536
- What are you...
- My girl. Who's your girl?

01:27:28.538 --> 01:27:29.704
Well, I can explain that. That just like...

01:27:29.705 --> 01:27:31.674
Who's your girl, Jake?

01:27:31.675 --> 01:27:32.841
I was...

01:27:32.842 --> 01:27:34.477
That guy's a fucking asshole

01:27:34.478 --> 01:27:36.443
who was really shitty
to a good friend of mine.

01:27:36.444 --> 01:27:38.480
- Okay?
- You can't even say it.

01:27:38.481 --> 01:27:41.005
You can't even look at
me and just say her name.

01:27:43.753 --> 01:27:45.321
- I don't even...
- Give me the courtesy.

01:27:45.322 --> 01:27:46.522
What are you talking...

01:27:46.523 --> 01:27:49.692
I haven't even spoken
to her since she left.

01:27:49.693 --> 01:27:52.528
I'm... I didn't do anything wrong here.

01:27:52.529 --> 01:27:54.430
- Okay?
- You've been playing house.

01:27:54.431 --> 01:27:55.898
- Oh, Shit!
- I let my son...

01:27:55.899 --> 01:27:57.732
- What are you talkin' about?
- ...fall in love with you.

01:27:57.733 --> 01:27:59.634
- Oh come on, that is not true.
- You've been lying this whole time.

01:27:59.635 --> 01:28:01.671
I'm not... I have not lied! I have...

01:28:01.672 --> 01:28:06.006
I have not... I am... I would
not lie to you. To him, okay?

01:28:06.007 --> 01:28:08.344
I wasn't trying to hurt you.

01:28:08.345 --> 01:28:10.779
- Wow, you really, you really...
- Really what?

01:28:10.780 --> 01:28:11.947
2 different people, my friend.

01:28:11.948 --> 01:28:14.916
Oh, come on. I am not, okay?

01:28:14.917 --> 01:28:16.618
But you're gonna figure it out.

01:28:16.619 --> 01:28:19.109
Figure what... What are you doing?

01:28:19.890 --> 01:28:21.981
Y-y-you're
just gonna go?

01:28:23.627 --> 01:28:24.894
Okay.

01:28:24.895 --> 01:28:25.928
Great.

01:28:25.929 --> 01:28:27.519
Great, okay.

01:28:28.497 --> 01:28:30.455
Great!

01:28:32.636 --> 01:28:34.569
Wonderful.

01:28:34.570 --> 01:28:35.738
Fuckin'...

01:28:40.444 --> 01:28:42.509
Who wants more wine?

01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:43.746
- I'll take some.
- Great.

01:28:46.047 --> 01:28:47.349
<i>Hello?</i>

01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:49.117
Hey, baby.

01:28:49.118 --> 01:28:51.019
- <i>Jake?</i>
- Yeah.

01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.555
Yeah, yeah. How you doin'?

01:28:53.556 --> 01:28:58.661
Um, I-I'm fine. Where
are you calling me from?

01:28:58.662 --> 01:29:00.129
Hey, did you know they
don't have a separate jail

01:29:00.130 --> 01:29:02.564
for cool people who fucked up?

01:29:02.565 --> 01:29:03.998
<i>Just one big old jail for everyone.</i>

01:29:03.999 --> 01:29:07.125
Jake. What happened?

01:29:08.739 --> 01:29:12.597
Well, I ran into our old
college buddy, Matthew Sobvechik.

01:29:14.677 --> 01:29:17.545
Oh, baby, what did you do?

01:29:17.547 --> 01:29:20.515
Well, I, um...

01:29:20.516 --> 01:29:24.719
I, uh, sorta beat the shit out of him.

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:27.389
- <i>Fucked up his life a little bit.</i>
- ...what it was.

01:29:27.390 --> 01:29:29.179
Why did you do that?

01:29:30.594 --> 01:29:32.183
I, um...

01:29:33.130 --> 01:29:35.421
Well I just, um...

01:29:37.167 --> 01:29:39.425
I just really miss you.

01:29:40.770 --> 01:29:43.627
<i>Yeah, I think about
you like, all the time.</i>

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:46.840
<i>You know what, the word
think is... is wrong</i>

01:29:46.841 --> 01:29:48.643
because I don't actively do anything.

01:29:48.644 --> 01:29:51.169
You're just... here.

01:29:56.484 --> 01:29:58.853
<i>But I didn't... I didn't
think I'd remember you.</i>

01:29:58.854 --> 01:30:00.922
<i>You know I thought that I
would forget about all of it.</i>

01:30:00.923 --> 01:30:04.993
<i>And I, uh, didn't. You
know, I just, uh...</i>

01:30:04.994 --> 01:30:06.895
<i>I know we're no good at this shit.</i>

01:30:06.896 --> 01:30:08.763
<i>And that's why we agreed
to stop seeing each other.</i>

01:30:08.764 --> 01:30:10.555
<i>So we wouldn't fuck it up but...</i>

01:30:11.901 --> 01:30:14.501
But I want you to come back.

01:30:14.502 --> 01:30:18.129
I need you to... Because, uh...

01:30:21.011 --> 01:30:26.270
Because I'd rather fail with
you than win with anyone else.

01:30:33.088 --> 01:30:34.545
<i>Hello?</i>

01:30:37.127 --> 01:30:40.662
- <i>Lainey, are you still there?</i>
- Just keep talking.

01:30:40.663 --> 01:30:42.964
I love hearing your voice.

01:30:42.965 --> 01:30:45.033
- <i>I love hearing you say my name.</i>
- Oh, you do?

01:30:45.034 --> 01:30:46.202
- <i>Jake.</i>
- Lainey!

01:30:46.203 --> 01:30:48.103
- <i>Jake.</i>
- Lainey!

01:30:48.104 --> 01:30:49.138
- Jake.
- <i>I love you so much.</i>

01:30:49.139 --> 01:30:50.705
- I love you.
- <i>Lainey, Lainey, Lainey.</i>

01:30:50.706 --> 01:30:53.108
- I love you!
- I love you so much!

01:30:53.109 --> 01:30:55.076
- Hey, I love you.
- <i>I love you, Jake!</i>

01:30:55.077 --> 01:30:56.612
- Give me the phone.
- Lainey, Lainey! No, no.

01:30:56.613 --> 01:30:58.912
What are you doing? Fucking take it.

01:30:58.914 --> 01:31:01.050
Okay, honey, you're on speaker
phone in a police station.

01:31:01.051 --> 01:31:04.619
- Be very careful what you say.
- Hello, police.

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:08.056
I love you. I love you. Don't...
don't hurt anymore people.

01:31:08.057 --> 01:31:12.760
Easy. Easy. Watch it! Back off! Back off!

01:31:12.761 --> 01:31:17.732
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

01:31:17.733 --> 01:31:22.460
<i>- I love you! I love you!
- Jake, I love you.</i>

01:31:30.011 --> 01:31:31.602
Yes?

01:31:32.148 --> 01:31:34.282
Yes.

01:31:34.283 --> 01:31:37.174
<i>I will communicate the message.</i>

01:31:38.889 --> 01:31:41.022
<i>Mr. Sobvechik will
not be joining us.</i>

01:31:41.023 --> 01:31:42.756
<i>We will have to postpone.</i>

01:31:42.757 --> 01:31:45.125
Come on. This is the third time.

01:31:45.126 --> 01:31:46.996
<i>My client has a newborn he
has to spend time with...</i>

01:31:46.997 --> 01:31:49.898
<i>We have made a generous
offer to settle this lawsuit.</i>

01:31:49.899 --> 01:31:53.068
<i>Your client is clearly
dragging this thing out...</i>

01:31:53.069 --> 01:31:55.126
<i>We'll be in touch to reschedule.</i>

01:32:05.748 --> 01:32:09.018
I forgot that Pinkerton
was an alias of yours.

01:32:09.019 --> 01:32:11.377
You never caught that reference.

01:32:13.289 --> 01:32:15.246
Madame Butterfly.

01:32:16.324 --> 01:32:18.058
Just because I don't applaud your intellect

01:32:18.059 --> 01:32:20.684
doesn't mean I don't notice it.

01:32:28.771 --> 01:32:30.005
Mathew...

01:32:30.006 --> 01:32:32.206
I need you to swear

01:32:32.207 --> 01:32:34.108
that you didn't plan this.

01:32:34.109 --> 01:32:36.312
I didn't plan this.

01:32:36.313 --> 01:32:37.711
Jake's offering you a lot of money

01:32:37.712 --> 01:32:39.881
to settle this emotional distress lawsuit

01:32:39.882 --> 01:32:41.915
so just take it.

01:32:41.917 --> 01:32:44.219
Or what? Are you... are you threatening me?

01:32:44.220 --> 01:32:45.921
I don't need to threaten you.

01:32:45.922 --> 01:32:49.757
Let me guess. I drop it, or
you tell Emma we slept together.

01:32:49.758 --> 01:32:52.582
- I'd tell her what I know.
- Which is what?

01:32:54.729 --> 01:32:58.156
I know that you stop
breathing when you kiss.

01:33:00.136 --> 01:33:03.171
That when you lean in to
whisper, you put your lips

01:33:03.172 --> 01:33:05.830
right up against the back of my earlobe.

01:33:07.009 --> 01:33:08.876
That you kiss the back of my neck before

01:33:08.877 --> 01:33:11.635
you slip my coat over my shoulders.

01:33:14.184 --> 01:33:17.207
I remember every
compliment you ever gave me.

01:33:18.287 --> 01:33:21.312
Everything you ever did to me in bed.

01:33:22.891 --> 01:33:24.158
And the day you made me yours.

01:33:24.159 --> 01:33:26.362
The day you said...

01:33:26.363 --> 01:33:30.064
..."Elaine, I wish I could have known you

01:33:30.065 --> 01:33:32.701
"when you were a little girl,
so that I could've been..."

01:33:32.702 --> 01:33:34.826
"Could've been your true love."

01:33:36.239 --> 01:33:38.696
I remember too, you know.

01:33:40.141 --> 01:33:42.734
Would any of it sound familiar to Emma?

01:33:44.346 --> 01:33:46.648
Some, yeah.

01:33:46.649 --> 01:33:47.550
I don't think she needs to know

01:33:47.551 --> 01:33:49.184
the things she holds close to her heart

01:33:49.185 --> 01:33:52.143
were rehearsed on someone else.

01:33:54.990 --> 01:33:56.848

Am I allowed to leave the state?

01:34:11.841 --> 01:34:13.073
Because I booked us a flight back

01:34:13.074 --> 01:34:14.376
to Michigan at 10:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.

01:34:14.377 --> 01:34:16.710

There's gonna be a honeymoon.

01:34:22.818 --> 01:34:23.786
I got us the penthouse suite

down at the plaza right down the road here.

01:34:25.086 --> 01:34:26.454

- Mm-hmm.

01:34:26.455 --> 01:34:27.755

01:34:36.265 --> 01:34:38.198
I can't believe we lost our virginity

01:34:38.199 --> 01:34:41.001
to each other and saved
ourselves for marriage.

01:34:41.002 --> 01:34:42.836
- Yeah.
- That's pretty great.

01:34:42.837 --> 01:34:43.906

Yeah, yeah. It's been a while.

01:34:49.078 --> 01:34:51.012
But I know what your
situation is down there.

01:34:51.013 --> 01:34:53.938
Oh, really? Yeah, how's my situation?

01:34:54.917 --> 01:34:57.941
Are you kidding? It's perfect.

01:35:00.221 --> 01:35:04.448

Well, from safe word to code word, I guess.

01:35:18.773 --> 01:35:20.341

- Let's go fuck first.

01:35:20.342 --> 01:35:21.943
- Then we'll meet them down there.
- We gotta do it now, yeah.

01:35:21.944 --> 01:35:23.311

01:35:25.046 --> 01:35:26.181
Absolutely. How long shall
I tell him we're going to be?

01:35:26.182 --> 01:35:29.784
- A couple of hours.
- Really? Luck guy, aren't I?

01:35:29.785 --> 01:35:31.152
Yeah, and then we'll still go get married.

01:35:31.153 --> 01:35:32.354

01:36:33.482 --> 01:36:35.550

I have had like, actual intercourse...

01:36:40.289 --> 01:36:42.357
I bet they're counting
like, foreplay and stuff.

01:36:42.358 --> 01:36:44.992
No, but maybe they are.

Frankly, I'd be shocked
if they made it at all.

01:36:48.297 --> 01:36:50.198
I bet this sex thing is a ruse.

01:36:50.199 --> 01:36:52.000
- For what?
- They're having trouble.

01:36:52.001 --> 01:36:54.035

01:36:54.036 --> 01:36:54.937
Second thoughts?

01:36:54.938 --> 01:36:56.904
They literally just got back together.

01:36:56.905 --> 01:36:59.974
I know. But now they
have this whole sex thing.

01:36:59.975 --> 01:37:02.344
- I don't know.
- First of all...

01:37:02.345 --> 01:37:04.411
...we had sex, at the last minute

01:37:04.412 --> 01:37:05.848
right before we got married.

01:37:05.849 --> 01:37:08.216
- I don't think that's true.
- Really?

01:37:08.217 --> 01:37:11.019
You don't remember someone sneaking
into my room right before...

01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:13.855
Who? Who? I'll murder him.

01:37:13.856 --> 01:37:16.023
Text us if you're gonna do this.

01:37:16.024 --> 01:37:18.425
And we'll be there. I've got
the rings, the whole deal.

01:37:18.426 --> 01:37:21.363
- So just, uh...
- We're gonna have sex for 9 minutes.

01:37:21.364 --> 01:37:22.964
We're gonna have sex...

01:37:22.965 --> 01:37:24.432
Yes, we're gonna have sex for 9 minutes.

01:37:24.433 --> 01:37:28.237
Now, I... Now, I'm super happy with 4 to 6.

01:37:28.238 --> 01:37:31.038
4 to 6 minutes or 46 inches?

01:37:31.039 --> 01:37:33.975
- Both.
- I can get to like, 6 and a quarter.

01:37:33.976 --> 01:37:35.611
- I'll show you, right now!
- Prove it.

01:37:35.612 --> 01:37:37.445
- Alright.
- It is so cold.

01:37:37.446 --> 01:37:38.947
- I can't get hard right now.
- Do show me.

01:37:38.948 --> 01:37:40.948
- I can't get hard right now.
- Alright.

01:37:40.949 --> 01:37:42.516
- Ooh, I wanna though.
- Here.

01:37:42.517 --> 01:37:44.019
If they're gonna be 90 minutes...

01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:46.421
- Will this help?
- Yeah. Ooh, that's do it then.

01:37:46.422 --> 01:37:48.112
It's doin' somethin'.

01:37:48.991 --> 01:37:50.991
Ooh, there's a kid lookin' at me.

01:37:50.992 --> 01:37:53.127
The kid's locked eyes with me.

01:37:53.128 --> 01:37:55.063
- Hey.
- We made it work.

01:37:55.064 --> 01:37:58.366
12 years. Who would've thought?

01:37:58.367 --> 01:38:01.068
I bet... I bet my brother 7 and I'd be out.

01:38:01.069 --> 01:38:03.470
- I had to give him $5000.
- What?

01:38:03.471 --> 01:38:05.072
Yeah, 5 years ago.

01:38:05.073 --> 01:38:07.442
I gave him $5000, remember you were so mad?

01:38:07.443 --> 01:38:08.609
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

01:38:08.610 --> 01:38:10.010
- I paid him that...
- You said...

01:38:10.011 --> 01:38:11.979
Because I... I lasted longer.

01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:13.737
You said you got into a car accident.

01:38:14.617 --> 01:38:17.218
It's weird to look at you for this long.

01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:20.188
- What do you mean?
- I never look at you.

01:38:20.189 --> 01:38:22.813
You gotta get a good gander.

01:38:25.627 --> 01:38:27.394
What are you doin'? Don't dance.

01:38:27.395 --> 01:38:30.965
Don't dance, please. Ugh!

01:38:30.966 --> 01:38:32.634
I don't like it. What
are you... what are you...

01:38:32.635 --> 01:38:35.103
Don't grind up on me.

01:38:35.104 --> 01:38:36.537
- What?
- There's not even music.

01:38:36.538 --> 01:38:39.474
Really? There's music in my body.

01:38:39.475 --> 01:38:41.376
Now, something's gonna
happen. Let's get outta here.
