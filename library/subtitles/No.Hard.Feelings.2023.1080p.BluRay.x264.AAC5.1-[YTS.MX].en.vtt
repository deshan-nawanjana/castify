I'm assuming that I'm here

and the reason
you haven't found anyone yet

265

you called a professional.

- [Maddie] Mm.

315

and the Buick is yours?

316
00:17:07.694 --> 00:17:10.571

319

do you mean date him or date him?

- Yes.
- Yeah, that's correct.

321

- Date him.
- Date him hard.

322

Okay.

323
00:17:24.670 --> 00:17:26.213

324
00:17:26.213 --> 00:17:28.715

Should I jump out and surprise him?

He was a drug dog for the state police,
but they forced him into retirement

you're a suitable candidate.

Because I can't have dogs of my own.

with the dog if you move?

You can come back another day, though.

You could do that.

Then you wouldn't have to worry
about a car or property taxes.

No. No way I'm gonna be on call

[poignant music playing]

864
00:43:24.146 --> 00:43:25.939

00:43:35.073 --> 00:43:36.992
I had to switch schools...

868
00:43:37.993 --> 00:43:40.579
after I had a sleepover in ninth grade
and everybody found out

869
00:43:40.579 --> 00:43:43.874
that I still slept
in my parents' room sometimes, so...

870
00:43:46.418 --> 00:43:50.881
It turned into this rumor
that I slept in the same bed with them...

871
00:43:52.216 --> 00:43:54.801
and then it became
that I had sex with them.

872
00:43:57.930 --> 00:43:58.931
It was awful.

873
00:43:59.556 --> 00:44:02.267
Probably why I spend so much time alone.

874
00:44:02.267 --> 00:44:03.769
You don't have any friends?

875

Yeah, I have tons of friends, just online.

878
00:44:15.906 --> 00:44:17.950
- Jody's my old nanny.
- Turn around.

879
00:44:28.544 --> 00:44:31.171
I'm sorry
I couldn't have sex with you today.

880
00:44:32.756 --> 00:44:35.843
I guess I'm just a bit of a romantic.

881
00:44:36.885 --> 00:44:37.719
It's okay.

882
00:44:38.887 --> 00:44:41.348
Maybe we could spend the day
together tomorrow?

883

1206
01:03:21.134 --> 01:03:23.220
Just getting a beer, Frosted.

1207
01:03:23.220 --> 01:03:24.596
Did she just call me Frosted?

1208
01:03:24.596 --> 01:03:26.723
That, my friends,
is what we call a bully, huh?

1209
01:03:26.723 --> 01:03:29.893
Oh, no, not a phone.
Someone help, I'm being filmed.

1210
01:03:32.187 --> 01:03:33.605
Have you seen Percy?

1211
01:03:33.605 --> 01:03:37.067
Oh, yo, <i>mami.</i> How old are you?

1212
01:03:38.026 --> 01:03:39.027
Twenty-three.

1213
01:03:39.027 --> 01:03:40.654
Damn, you old as fuck.

1214
01:03:40.654 --> 01:03:44.199
- No disrespect. He loves cougars.
- I fuck with the big cats.

1215
01:03:44.199 --> 01:03:46.326
Why don't you two big cats
fuck each other, then?

1216
01:03:46.326 --> 01:03:48.120
Whoa!

1217
01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:49.997
- Is that an insult?
- Shut the front door.

1218
01:03:50.873 --> 01:03:51.999
It sure is, professor.

1219
01:03:51.999 --> 01:03:54.835
Why is us having sex
with each other an insult? I'm confused.

1220
01:03:54.835 --> 01:03:58.088
- Say what you just said. Say that again.
- No, I didn't mean it in a homophobic way.

1221
01:03:58.088 --> 01:03:59.965
How'd you mean it, then?

1222
01:03:59.965 --> 01:04:02.426
It was a joke. I'm not--
I've been with girls.

1223
01:04:02.426 --> 01:04:04.261
I'm not homophobic.

1224
01:04:04.261 --> 01:04:07.097
Where the fuck did you come from?
Stop filming me. No comment.

1225
01:04:08.974 --> 01:04:10.517
[girl 1] Whose mom is that?

1226
01:04:13.228 --> 01:04:14.897
Have you seen Percy?

1227
01:04:16.106 --> 01:04:17.024
[laughing]

1228
01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:18.275
Oh, my God.

1229
01:04:18.275 --> 01:04:20.777
[laughs mockingly] Was that funny?

1230
01:04:20.777 --> 01:04:22.696
He's with Natalie upstairs.

1231
01:04:22.696 --> 01:04:24.406
[dramatic rock music playing]

1232
01:04:24.406 --> 01:04:25.616
Hey!

1233
01:04:32.539 --> 01:04:34.166
Move! Coming through.

1234
01:04:35.959 --> 01:04:37.794
- Percy?
- Yeah?

1235
01:04:37.794 --> 01:04:39.338
Wait, your name's Percy?

1236
01:04:39.338 --> 01:04:40.464
Yeah.

1237
01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:43.592
Percy?

1238
01:04:44.384 --> 01:04:46.094
Sorry. Continue.

1239
01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:47.262
Percy?

1240
01:04:49.515 --> 01:04:51.308
Doesn't anyone fuck anymore?

1241
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:55.771
Percy?

1242
01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:57.356
Percy?

1243
01:04:58.357 --> 01:04:59.733
Open this door!

1244
01:04:59.733 --> 01:05:00.817
Percy!

1245
01:05:01.610 --> 01:05:04.488
Percy, open this door.
This is your last chance.

1246
01:05:13.747 --> 01:05:15.707
[screaming]

1247
01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:18.126
- Did you fuck him?
- Oh, my God.

1248
01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:20.045
Did you fuck him?

1249
01:05:20.045 --> 01:05:21.713
Calm down. Please, nothing happened.

1250
01:05:21.713 --> 01:05:22.923
The room is spinning.

1251
01:05:22.923 --> 01:05:24.341
You're drunk already?

1252
01:05:24.341 --> 01:05:27.177
No, he took something.
I don't know. I think it was a pill.

1253
01:05:27.177 --> 01:05:31.557
Percy? Did you take something?
Percy, did you take a pill?

1254
01:05:35.060 --> 01:05:36.436
Come... [grunting]

1255
01:05:40.566 --> 01:05:43.151
Stick your fingers down your throat.
Make yourself throw up.

1256
01:05:43.151 --> 01:05:45.320
- I don't wanna.
- Deeper, deeper.

1257
01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:46.947
[whining]

1258
01:05:46.947 --> 01:05:48.156
[yells]

1259
01:05:48.156 --> 01:05:49.825
No. [whines]

1260
01:05:49.825 --> 01:05:50.993
[Maddie] Let me do it!

1261
01:05:50.993 --> 01:05:52.286
[gagging]

1262
01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:00.252
[Maddie] Do you feel better?

1263
01:06:01.545 --> 01:06:03.672
Not even at all.

1264
01:06:03.672 --> 01:06:07.301
I didn't know
you couldn't drink on Ibuprofen.

1265
01:06:08.635 --> 01:06:09.970
That's what you took?

1266
01:06:11.847 --> 01:06:14.558
- Found her.
- Okay, who told the joke?

1267
01:06:14.558 --> 01:06:16.059
Your fucking parents are here?

1268
01:06:16.059 --> 01:06:19.479
You think our son would have
a party without our consent?

1269
01:06:19.479 --> 01:06:21.648
That's it. Come on. You don't belong here.

1270
01:06:21.648 --> 01:06:24.526
I don't belong here?
I've fucking lived here my whole life!

1271
01:06:24.526 --> 01:06:25.611
You don't belong here.

1272
01:06:25.611 --> 01:06:29.031
You don't belong
at a high-school party, miss.

1273
01:06:29.031 --> 01:06:31.033
Oh, well, yeah-- We're leaving.

1274
01:06:31.033 --> 01:06:32.618
- Let me get--
- Stay away from her.

1275
01:06:32.618 --> 01:06:33.660
Stay back. Okay?

1276
01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:36.163
- I said, let go of her--
- Stay back!

1277
01:06:36.163 --> 01:06:38.373
- Get out of here. Come on.
- Don't touch me! Percy--

1278
01:06:38.874 --> 01:06:40.167
- [wheezing]
- [crowd] Oh!

1279
01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:43.295
Oh, shi-- Oh, fuck! Oh, sh-- Maddie.

1280
01:06:43.295 --> 01:06:45.547
[gasping]

1281
01:06:49.009 --> 01:06:49.885
Fuck!

1282
01:06:50.719 --> 01:06:51.720
We should go.

1283
01:07:02.439 --> 01:07:05.692
I just want you to know
I would never hurt you.

1284
01:07:08.987 --> 01:07:10.239
[in raspy voice] I know.

1285
01:07:10.239 --> 01:07:11.406
[clears throat]

1286
01:07:14.743 --> 01:07:15.953
I'm ready for you.

1287
01:07:17.871 --> 01:07:19.915
- [in normal voice] Are you sure?
- Yes.

1288
01:07:22.626 --> 01:07:23.460
Okay.

1289
01:07:24.503 --> 01:07:25.337
I, um...

1290
01:07:34.346 --> 01:07:36.765
I don't know.
Where's the perforation?

1291
01:07:38.851 --> 01:07:40.018
Let me help you.

1292
01:07:46.233 --> 01:07:47.609
I love you.

1293
01:07:49.695 --> 01:07:52.698
[tender, pensive music playing]

1294
01:07:53.782 --> 01:07:56.243
Percy, you're drunk.

1295
01:07:57.578 --> 01:07:58.579
A little.

1296
01:07:59.413 --> 01:08:03.500
Is that all right?
I mean, I still love you.

1297
01:08:04.126 --> 01:08:06.420
I don't think we should do this
when you're drunk.

1298
01:08:07.045 --> 01:08:08.630
Not for your first time.

1299
01:08:09.673 --> 01:08:10.507
Okay.

1300
01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:15.053
I think we should wait.

1301
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:17.514
If that's what you want.

1302
01:08:19.850 --> 01:08:21.018
That's what I want.

1303
01:08:32.821 --> 01:08:35.490
- Well, look what the cat dragged in.
- [chuckles]

1304
01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:38.118
- Fun night?
- Yeah, yeah, really fun.

1305
01:08:38.118 --> 01:08:39.368
That's good.

1306
01:08:40.245 --> 01:08:42.497
Hey, I'll drive you to work. We can chat.

1307
01:08:43.665 --> 01:08:45.834
Uh, actually,
would it be all right if I drive?

1308
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:50.589
I'm thinking about getting my license,
so, you know, I could use the practice.

1309
01:08:50.589 --> 01:08:52.549
My son, the licensed driver?

1310
01:08:52.549 --> 01:08:55.426
Yeah, it'll just...
You know, if I have a car,

1311
01:08:55.426 --> 01:08:57.095
it'll be easier to see my girlfriend.

1312
01:08:57.804 --> 01:09:00.015
Oh! Your girlfriend?

1313
01:09:01.225 --> 01:09:04.728
Yeah. Her name is, uh, Maddie.

1314
01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:08.398
She's on the older side.
Uh, but she's really, really fun.

1315
01:09:09.358 --> 01:09:10.776
- Fun's important.
- Yeah.

1316
01:09:10.776 --> 01:09:14.988
She doesn't really wanna do long-distance,
so I'm not gonna go to Princeton.

1317
01:09:16.823 --> 01:09:17.658
What?

1318
01:09:18.658 --> 01:09:21.828
Just, you know, Maddie's here.

1319
01:09:22.578 --> 01:09:23.705
Just makes sense for us.

1320
01:09:23.705 --> 01:09:25.832
- You're going to Princeton.
- Uh-huh.

1321
01:09:25.832 --> 01:09:27.042
I'm not.

1322
01:09:27.917 --> 01:09:29.711
- I'm 19.
- Okay.

1323
01:09:29.711 --> 01:09:31.171
I'm an adult now.

1324
01:09:31.171 --> 01:09:34.383
I can make my own decisions.
And I'm going to stay here, okay?

1325
01:09:35.008 --> 01:09:35.843
Um...

1326
01:09:35.843 --> 01:09:39.470
Sweetie, why don't you go wait in the car?
And Daddy will be right out.

1327
01:09:43.809 --> 01:09:45.185
What the fuck was that?

1328
01:09:50.314 --> 01:09:51.567
Just relax, okay?

1329
01:09:52.192 --> 01:09:55.279
You drive for a living.
Let me take this one.

1330
01:09:57.990 --> 01:10:01.618
She's angling for the Tesla.
Call her right now. I'm gonna yell at her.

1331
01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:03.078
- You're gonna yell at her?
- Yeah.

1332
01:10:03.078 --> 01:10:06.290
You're gonna yell at the one person
who can convince him to go to college?

1333
01:10:06.290 --> 01:10:08.292
- You're right. You're right.
- I know.

1334
01:10:08.292 --> 01:10:10.544
You think that they, uh...? That...?

1335
01:10:10.544 --> 01:10:12.087
Call her. Call her now.

1336
01:10:13.338 --> 01:10:15.340
[buzzing]

1337
01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:20.220
Hi.

1338
01:10:21.013 --> 01:10:22.639
I was gonna call you.

1339
01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:24.600
Listen, I don't think I can do this.

1340
01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:26.685
<i>Percy has gotten way too attached.</i>

1341
01:10:27.311 --> 01:10:28.937
You can have the car.

1342
01:10:30.105 --> 01:10:31.106
Really?

1343
01:10:32.191 --> 01:10:33.358
Even though we didn't...?

1344
01:10:33.358 --> 01:10:37.029
Uh, listen, you got him out of his shell,
and that's all we wanted.

1345
01:10:37.029 --> 01:10:40.365
But now he's got this idea
that he wants to stay in Montauk,

1346
01:10:40.365 --> 01:10:43.911
and you need to convince him
that he has to go to college.

1347
01:10:46.538 --> 01:10:47.372
Yeah.

1348
01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:51.168
Great. Great.
I'll sign over the title today.

1349
01:10:54.254 --> 01:10:57.257
[Maddie on speaker] <i>So if I can convince
him to go to Princeton, I get the car?</i>

01:10:57.257 --> 01:10:59.176
<i>I don't have to have sex with him anymore?</i>

1351
01:10:59.176 --> 01:11:01.261
- Hello? Maddie? Hello?
- Maddie?

[poignant music playing]

1354
01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.561
Can I try some wine?

1355
01:11:52.396 --> 01:11:53.313
- Yeah.
- Sure.

1356
01:11:53.313 --> 01:11:55.065
- I think that's okay.
- Mm-hm.

1357
01:12:03.073 --> 01:12:04.950
Okay. That's good.

1358
01:12:04.950 --> 01:12:05.868
[Laird] Easy there.

1359
01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:17.379
[Allison] Sweetie, please.

1360
01:12:18.046 --> 01:12:20.424
- You wanna savor it. Savor it.
- Yeah.

1361
01:12:20.424 --> 01:12:21.925
[doorbell chimes]

1362

[mischievous music playing]

1363
01:12:34.062 --> 01:12:35.772
Oh!

1364
01:12:35.772 --> 01:12:37.900
Did I double-book?

1365
01:12:45.657 --> 01:12:48.118
Aren't you guys gonna
ask Maddie about herself?

1366
01:12:49.328 --> 01:12:52.497
Oh, uh, Maddie, where are you--?
Where are you from?

1367
01:12:52.497 --> 01:12:55.751
Um, here, actually. I'm from here.

1368
01:12:55.751 --> 01:12:58.504
Yeah, in fact, she's never--
You've never left, right?

1369
01:12:58.504 --> 01:13:01.215
Well, it's so beautiful here,
I don't blame you.

1370
01:13:02.424 --> 01:13:03.592
This chicken is delicious.

1371
01:13:03.592 --> 01:13:04.760
Oh, thank you.

1372
01:13:05.385 --> 01:13:07.721
- Mom, you didn't make it. Inez did.
- Percy.

1373
01:13:08.639 --> 01:13:11.892
Well, the important thing is
that it's delicious.

1374
01:13:11.892 --> 01:13:13.769
I think the important thing is the truth.

1375
01:13:14.853 --> 01:13:18.106
And I haven't been
