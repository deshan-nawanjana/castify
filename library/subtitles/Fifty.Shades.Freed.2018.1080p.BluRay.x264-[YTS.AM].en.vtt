00:10:51.651 --> 00:10:53.609
Because I can.

185
00:10:55.045 --> 00:10:56.612
-♪ Let me let you just

186
00:10:56.656 --> 00:10:58.745
-♪ Lay me down

187
00:10:58.788 --> 00:11:00.703
♪ Turn me on

188
00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:05.577
♪ Take it all tonight.

189
00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.062
I should misbehave more often.

190
00:11:12.106 --> 00:11:14.412
Yeah, maybe you should.

191
00:11:14.456 --> 00:11:17.198
-Mm.

192
00:11:17.241 --> 00:11:18.765
Hey, Ros, what's up?

193
00:11:18.808 --> 00:11:20.810
I'm-I'm sorry to interrupt
your honeymoon.

194
00:11:20.854 --> 00:11:23.117
We had a fire in the main
server room this morning.

195
00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.901
-No.

196
00:11:24.945 --> 00:11:26.468
And the damage
could have been much worse.

197
00:11:26.511 --> 00:11:27.643
The fire suppression system
kicked in.

198
00:11:27.687 --> 00:11:29.384
It looks like arson.

199
00:11:29.427 --> 00:11:32.169
Someone planted
an explosive device.

200
00:11:32.213 --> 00:11:33.910
This guy.

201
00:11:33.954 --> 00:11:36.434
Security is sweeping the room
for fingerprints and DNA.

202
00:11:36.478 --> 00:11:38.045
Did he get any data?

203
00:11:38.088 --> 00:11:40.569
He took some of your
personal files, and then he

204
00:11:40.612 --> 00:11:42.571
might have set the fire
to cover his tracks.

205
00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:43.877
Uh, can you go back?

206
00:11:47.054 --> 00:11:48.577
Oh, my God.

207
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:49.796
That's Jack.

208
00:11:49.839 --> 00:11:51.058
Who's Jack?

209
00:11:51.101 --> 00:11:53.669
Jack Hyde,
formerly of S.I.P.

210
00:11:53.713 --> 00:11:55.453
- Uh, he was my boss.
- Uh-huh.

211
00:11:55.497 --> 00:11:57.760
Not anymore.
He's been dealt with.

212
00:11:57.804 --> 00:11:59.893
I'm sorry, we need to go home.

213
00:11:59.936 --> 00:12:02.504
Ros, can you tell Andrea
I need the jet

214
00:12:02.547 --> 00:12:03.897
in Nice tomorrow, please?

215
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.116
Got it.
I-I'm sorry, Mrs. Grey.

216
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.596
Oh, don't be.

217
00:12:14.951 --> 00:12:17.127
Why would Jack do that?
It's insane.

218
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.175
What?

219
00:12:21.218 --> 00:12:22.872
I got a report from the FAA.

220
00:12:22.916 --> 00:12:24.831
They don't think
that the helicopter crash

221
00:12:24.874 --> 00:12:26.397
was an accident.

222
00:12:26.441 --> 00:12:28.095
They said it looks
like sabotage.

223
00:12:28.138 --> 00:12:29.661
Sabotage?
Why wouldn't you tell me that?

224
00:12:29.705 --> 00:12:31.315
I didn't want you to worry.

225
00:12:31.359 --> 00:12:33.143
You think Jack did that, too?

226
00:12:33.187 --> 00:12:34.710
Why would he be going
to these lengths?

227
00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.494
I don't know.

228
00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:41.064
But don't worry.

229
00:12:41.108 --> 00:12:43.632
I swore I'd keep you safe,
and I will.

230
00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:56.558
Linc.

231
00:12:56.601 --> 00:12:57.864
Grey.

232
00:12:57.907 --> 00:12:58.952
Hello.

233
00:12:58.995 --> 00:13:00.562
This is my wife, Anastasia.

234
00:13:00.605 --> 00:13:02.999
-Ah, Mrs. Grey.
-Hi.

235
00:13:03.043 --> 00:13:05.045
Congratulations.

236
00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:06.481
-Thank you.

237
00:13:06.524 --> 00:13:07.961
And good luck.

238
00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:12.008
What was that?

239
00:13:12.052 --> 00:13:14.010
Never mind.

240
00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:16.230
Tell me.

241
00:13:16.273 --> 00:13:18.580
It's Elena's ex.

242
00:13:19.929 --> 00:13:21.496
Mr. Robinson?

243
00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:22.976
Yes.

244
00:13:23.019 --> 00:13:24.586
He doesn't like me very much.

245
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:26.240
I could tell.

246
00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.898
Ana, that's not funny.

247
00:13:34.117 --> 00:13:36.250
-Oh, uh...

248
00:13:36.293 --> 00:13:38.861
Mr. and Mrs. Grey,
welcome home.

249
00:13:38.905 --> 00:13:40.123
-Hi, Gail.
-Thank you.

250
00:13:40.167 --> 00:13:41.255
Uh, Sawyer, ma'am.

251
00:13:41.298 --> 00:13:42.386
Hello. Hi.

252
00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:43.648
This is my colleague, Prescott.

253
00:13:43.692 --> 00:13:45.563
-Hi.

254
00:13:45.607 --> 00:13:47.609
-Keep it simple.

255
00:13:47.652 --> 00:13:49.480
They'll be in charge
of your personal security.

256
00:13:49.524 --> 00:13:51.439
Oh.

257
00:13:51.482 --> 00:13:52.832
Both of you?

258
00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:54.485
We'll mostly take turns,
Mrs. Grey.

259
00:13:54.529 --> 00:13:55.965
You won't even know we're here.

260
00:13:56.009 --> 00:13:58.838
That seems unlikely,
but thank you.

261
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.058
-Come on.
-Can I get you something to eat

262
00:14:02.102 --> 00:14:03.625
-I'm good.

263
00:14:03.668 --> 00:14:05.714
Anastasia?

264
00:14:05.757 --> 00:14:07.063
Some tea, perhaps?

265
00:14:07.107 --> 00:14:08.891
Yeah. Yes. Thank you.

266
00:14:08.935 --> 00:14:11.459
I mean, please and thank...
and thank you.

267
00:14:13.113 --> 00:14:15.332
-I'll be in my office.
-Okay.

268
00:14:15.376 --> 00:14:16.899
Laters, baby.

269
00:14:16.943 --> 00:14:19.467
Now, when you have a moment,

270
00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.731
we should discuss how you'd
like to run the household.

271
00:14:22.774 --> 00:14:24.907
Run the household?

272
00:14:24.951 --> 00:14:26.691
The dinner menus,

273
00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:29.259
-the wine list,
uh, the flowers. -Oh.

274
00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:32.523
And what changes
you'd like made to the decor.

275
00:14:32.567 --> 00:14:34.525
Um...

276
00:14:34.569 --> 00:14:37.746
I-I know it's a lot
to take in, Mrs. Grey.

277
00:14:37.789 --> 00:14:38.965
There's no rush.

278
00:14:39.008 --> 00:14:40.444
Can't you just call me Ana?

279
00:14:40.488 --> 00:14:43.839
Well, Mr. Grey likes
to be called Mr. Grey,

280
00:14:43.883 --> 00:14:45.841
so that would be a little odd.

281
00:14:45.885 --> 00:14:47.843
Right. Okay.

282
00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:49.453
Now, what would you like
for tonight?

283
00:14:49.497 --> 00:14:51.107
I have boeuf bourguignon...

284
00:14:51.151 --> 00:14:52.804
Actually, I was kind of
thinking that maybe

285
00:14:52.848 --> 00:14:56.112
I could just cook dinner
for Christian tonight.

286
00:14:56.156 --> 00:14:57.374
Mrs. Grey.

287
00:14:57.418 --> 00:14:58.985
I'm so sorry. You prob...

288
00:14:59.028 --> 00:15:01.726
I don't want to mess up
your plans. I'm sorry.

289
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:05.034
Mrs. Grey, this is your home.

290
00:15:05.078 --> 00:15:06.993
:
This is your kitchen.

291
00:15:07.036 --> 00:15:08.951
You don't need
to ask permission.

292
00:15:08.995 --> 00:15:11.040
Now, why don't I show you
what's in the fridge,

293
00:15:11.084 --> 00:15:12.955
and you can take it from there.

294
00:15:12.999 --> 00:15:15.523
Perfect.

295
00:15:17.568 --> 00:15:19.266
Perfect timing.

296
00:15:20.832 --> 00:15:22.269
Where's Gail?

297
00:15:22.312 --> 00:15:23.879
I gave her the night off.

298
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:25.272
Sit.

299
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:32.670
Medium rare,
just how Sir likes it.

300
00:15:32.714 --> 00:15:35.108
I could get used to this.

301
00:15:35.151 --> 00:15:38.372
Well, we're kind of married,
so you might have to.

302
00:15:38.415 --> 00:15:40.417
I mean you in my kitchen.

303
00:15:42.419 --> 00:15:45.509
-Mm. -You mean barefoot
and pregnant?

304
00:15:47.903 --> 00:15:49.513
That was a joke.

305
00:15:49.557 --> 00:15:51.689
Yeah.

306
00:15:51.733 --> 00:15:54.605
I'm assuming it wasn't
the "barefoot" part

307
00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:57.260
that made you nearly choke
on your food.

308
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:02.613
You do want to have kids
someday, right?

309
00:16:02.657 --> 00:16:05.138
Someday, sure.

310
00:16:08.054 --> 00:16:10.317
You don't really sound sure.

311
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.275
You know what I am sure about?

312
00:16:12.319 --> 00:16:13.494
Hmm?

313
00:16:13.537 --> 00:16:14.930
That's great steak.

314
00:16:14.974 --> 00:16:16.279
Christian.

315
00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.938
Do you not want to have kids?

316
00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:24.766
Of course.

317
00:16:24.809 --> 00:16:27.987
One day, just not now.

318
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:31.164
I'm not ready to share you
with anyone.

319
00:16:41.696 --> 00:16:43.132
Mrs. Grey.

320
00:16:43.176 --> 00:16:45.265
Thank you.

321
00:16:49.356 --> 00:16:50.487
Hey, Brendan.

322
00:16:50.531 --> 00:16:51.923
Morning, Miss Steele.

323
00:16:51.967 --> 00:16:53.925
Welcome back,
Miss Steele. -Hi.

324
00:17:10.551 --> 00:17:12.118
Ana.

325
00:17:12.161 --> 00:17:13.597
Nice of you to join us.

326
00:17:13.641 --> 00:17:14.642
Hi, Liz.

327
00:17:14.685 --> 00:17:17.166
Am... am I in the right office?

328
00:17:17.210 --> 00:17:18.776
We had a makeover.

329
00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.388
Mr. Roach wanted to welcome
the new fiction editor.

330
00:17:21.431 --> 00:17:23.216
Who's the new fiction editor?

331
00:17:23.259 --> 00:17:24.826
You are.

332
00:17:24.869 --> 00:17:27.437
You got a promotion.

333
00:17:28.569 --> 00:17:29.918
I got a promotion?

334
00:17:29.961 --> 00:17:32.529
And you weren't even here.

335
00:17:32.573 --> 00:17:33.965
Ana!

336
00:17:34.009 --> 00:17:35.706
-Hi, Hannah.
: Hi.

337
00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:37.273
Hi.

338
00:17:37.317 --> 00:17:39.884
Hi. Welcome back.

339
00:17:39.928 --> 00:17:41.712
-Amazing.

340
00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:43.192
I'm gonna let you
get settled in.

341
00:17:43.236 --> 00:17:45.716
And, Ana, good luck.
Not that you need it.

342
00:17:47.457 --> 00:17:49.024
So...

343
00:17:49.068 --> 00:17:51.722
who is that beautiful man?

344
00:17:51.766 --> 00:17:54.290
Oh, that's Sawyer,
my personal security.

345
00:17:54.334 --> 00:17:55.726
Oh.

346
00:17:55.770 --> 00:17:58.729
I know.
It's very, very fancy.

347
00:17:58.773 --> 00:18:01.645
Um, can we find a spot for him?

348
00:18:01.689 --> 00:18:03.473
I might have an opening.

349
00:18:03.517 --> 00:18:05.214
-Hannah!
: What?

350
00:18:05.258 --> 00:18:06.868
Down, girl.

351
00:18:06.911 --> 00:18:08.783
Uh, everything's
in relatively the same spot.

352
00:18:08.826 --> 00:18:10.785
Oh, and I asked I.T.
to change your e-mail.

353
00:18:12.308 --> 00:18:14.267
Because they still have you
as Ana Steele

354
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:15.572
instead of Ana Grey.

355
00:18:15.616 --> 00:18:16.921
Oh.

356
00:18:16.965 --> 00:18:20.229
Um, l-let's just leave it

357
00:18:20.273 --> 00:18:21.578
-for a while.
-Done.

358
00:18:21.622 --> 00:18:23.145
And Boyce Fox is in town.

359
00:18:23.189 --> 00:18:25.016
I have penciled him in
for 11:00.

360
00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.715
-Amazing. Awesome.

361
00:18:27.758 --> 00:18:29.108
-Thank you. Thanks, Hannah.
-Yeah.

362
00:18:29.151 --> 00:18:30.283
Oh, wait, hold on.

363
00:18:33.547 --> 00:18:35.375
For your collection.

364
00:18:35.418 --> 00:18:37.159
Paris?

365
00:18:37.203 --> 00:18:39.030
Thank you.

366
00:18:39.074 --> 00:18:40.554
It's good to have you back, Ana.

367
00:18:40.597 --> 00:18:42.643
It's good to be back.

368
00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:46.342
♪

369
00:19:01.052 --> 00:19:02.880
This is amazing, Ana.

370
00:19:02.924 --> 00:19:04.099
I-I can't thank you enough.

371
00:19:04.143 --> 00:19:05.883
Well, you did the work.

372
00:19:10.845 --> 00:19:12.716
Hi. How can I help you?

373
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.718
Christian Grey
for Miss Ana Steele.

374
00:19:14.762 --> 00:19:17.417
Now, when am I gonna see pages
for book two?

375
00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:20.159
Already?
Um, well, I've written

376
00:19:20.202 --> 00:19:21.812
three chapters so far.

377
00:19:21.856 --> 00:19:23.510
Christian.

378
00:19:23.553 --> 00:19:25.990
Um, Boyce, this is my husband,
Christian Grey.

379
00:19:26.034 --> 00:19:28.036
Christian, this is Boyce Fox.

380
00:19:28.079 --> 00:19:29.864
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Absolutely.

381
00:19:29.907 --> 00:19:31.213
Do you mind?

382
00:19:31.257 --> 00:19:33.172
I need a word
with Miss Steele here.

383
00:19:33.215 --> 00:19:35.391
Uh, no. Actually, no, we're
not... we're not finished.

384
00:19:35.435 --> 00:19:38.873
Uh, you know, I'm just gonna
grab a coffee real quick.

385
00:19:38.916 --> 00:19:40.831
It was nice to meet you.

386
00:19:45.053 --> 00:19:46.533
Good-looking guy.

387
00:19:46.576 --> 00:19:48.578
Seriously, Christian?

388
00:19:48.622 --> 00:19:51.146
You're vetting my authors now?

389
00:19:53.279 --> 00:19:54.802
I tried e-mailing you.

390
00:19:54.845 --> 00:19:56.586
It bounced.

391
00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:59.110
There's no Anastasia Grey
at S.I.P.

392
00:20:00.373 --> 00:20:02.157
I know.

393
00:20:02.201 --> 00:20:04.072
Ana Steele is the name
I use at work.

394
00:20:04.115 --> 00:20:07.206
And I know you're gonna say
I don't need to work,

395
00:20:07.249 --> 00:20:10.121
but I can't stay home
and-and do lunches

396
00:20:10.165 --> 00:20:11.514
and choose wallpaper.

397
00:20:11.558 --> 00:20:13.429
I would lose my mind.

398
00:20:13.473 --> 00:20:15.649
I work because I love my job.

399
00:20:15.692 --> 00:20:17.390
Understood.

400
00:20:17.433 --> 00:20:19.740
But you can't love it
as Ana Grey?

401
00:20:19.783 --> 00:20:22.786
I need to have
my own identity here.

402
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:26.050
People already think I got
to where I am because of you.

403
00:20:26.094 --> 00:20:27.617
But you didn't.
You got this

404
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:31.186
through hard work and talent.

405
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:33.188
Why does it matter
what you call yourself?

406
00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.972
Who gives a shit
what people think?

407
00:20:35.016 --> 00:20:36.800
Well, apparently, you do.

408
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:40.021
Would you change your name
for me?

409
00:20:41.152 --> 00:20:42.328
Yes.

410
00:20:42.371 --> 00:20:44.286
If it meant that much to you.

411
00:20:45.505 --> 00:20:46.897
Okay.

412
00:20:46.941 --> 00:20:48.421
I'll think about it.

413
00:20:48.464 --> 00:20:50.161
You will?

414
00:20:50.205 --> 00:20:52.207
Yeah.

415
00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:56.298
That's how this works,
remember?

416
00:20:56.342 --> 00:20:58.605
Talk, listen...

417
00:20:58.648 --> 00:21:00.955
work stuff out.

418
00:21:00.998 --> 00:21:02.652
Now, get lost.

419
00:21:02.696 --> 00:21:04.263
I gotta find my author.

420
00:21:04.306 --> 00:21:06.526
And you need to shave.

421
00:21:09.964 --> 00:21:11.661
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

422
00:21:13.576 --> 00:21:16.144
I might not be done by then.

423
00:21:16.187 --> 00:21:20.279
My boss's boss's boss
is kind of a pain in the ass.

455
00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:00.117

Christian.

460
00:23:18.179 --> 00:23:19.441
Hi.

461
00:23:19.485 --> 00:23:21.574
-Mwah. Anastasia.
-Hi.

462
00:23:21.617 --> 00:23:23.924
This is Gia Matteo,
the architect.

463
00:23:23.967 --> 00:23:26.100
You were, um, at our wedding.

464
00:23:26.143 --> 00:23:28.232
-Mm-hmm.
-Gia's a friend of Elliot's.

465
00:23:28.276 --> 00:23:30.365
This location is perfect.

466
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:34.064
I'm going to build you
a fabulous house.

467
00:23:34.108 --> 00:23:35.805
I'd like to show Ana inside.

468
00:23:35.849 --> 00:23:37.894
Of course.

469
00:23:37.938 --> 00:23:40.636
-That GQ profile on you...

470
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.378
I love what you're doing
in Africa.

471
00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.511
Oh, thank you.

472
00:23:45.554 --> 00:23:48.992
Now, let me show you
what I have in mind.

473
00:23:51.865 --> 00:23:54.824
A state-of-the-art,
self-sufficient smart house.

474
00:23:54.868 --> 00:23:58.001
Marine steel,
self-cleaning glass,

475
00:23:58.045 --> 00:24:02.092
a guest wing with an
entertaining area to the west.

476
00:24:02.136 --> 00:24:04.660
And this infinity pool

477
00:24:04.704 --> 00:24:07.620
will really make that view
of the Sound.

478
00:24:09.186 --> 00:24:12.407
Um, you want to tear
the whole house down?

479
00:24:12.451 --> 00:24:13.930
Don't you?

480
00:24:13.974 --> 00:24:15.366
It's so dated.

481
00:24:15.410 --> 00:24:16.846
I like it.

482
00:24:16.890 --> 00:24:18.892
I think it has character.

483
00:24:20.981 --> 00:24:24.767
Well, a new house
would be a statement

484
00:24:24.811 --> 00:24:26.769
and ecologically efficient.

485
00:24:26.813 --> 00:24:29.772
I mean, these older places
are so impractical.

486
00:24:30.904 --> 00:24:32.340
It's up to you.

487
00:24:32.383 --> 00:24:33.820
Actually, it's up to my wife.

488
00:24:35.343 --> 00:24:36.910
What she says goes.

489
00:24:36.953 --> 00:24:38.389
Excuse me.

490
00:24:38.433 --> 00:24:39.826
Sure.

491
00:24:39.869 --> 00:24:41.262
Hey, Ros.

492
00:24:41.305 --> 00:24:42.916
- Christian, hey.
- Yeah.

493
00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:44.570
I suppose we could reuse

494
00:24:44.613 --> 00:24:47.529
-some of the existing stone.
-Gia.

495
00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.580
I'm sure you're
very good at what you do.

496
00:24:54.623 --> 00:24:57.452
Otherwise, Christian wouldn't
have asked for your input.

497
00:24:57.496 --> 00:24:59.280
But...

498
00:24:59.323 --> 00:25:02.196
please stop speaking to my
husband as if I weren't here.

499
00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:04.590
Ana...

500
00:25:04.633 --> 00:25:07.375
I have designed
many prestige projects.

501
00:25:07.418 --> 00:25:09.551
You may call me Mrs. Grey.

502
00:25:09.595 --> 00:25:12.075
And this is not
a prestige project.

503
00:25:12.119 --> 00:25:14.338
This is gonna be our home.

504
00:25:14.382 --> 00:25:17.472
So, if you want this job,

505
00:25:17.516 --> 00:25:20.040
I suggest you stop
making eyes at my husband

506
00:25:20.083 --> 00:25:21.737
and keep your hands
to yourself.

507
00:25:21.781 --> 00:25:25.872
Or you can go and climb back
into your shit-colored car

508
00:25:25.915 --> 00:25:27.743
and drive back to Seattle.

509
00:25:27.787 --> 00:25:29.353
It's up to you.

510
00:25:31.268 --> 00:25:35.925
Look, I'm sorry, Mrs. Grey,
but I would never...

511
00:25:38.232 --> 00:25:39.973
:
It won't happen again.

512
00:25:41.975 --> 00:25:43.411
Everything okay?

513
00:25:43.454 --> 00:25:44.804
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

514
00:25:44.847 --> 00:25:47.546
We were just discussing
an alternative approach.

515
00:25:47.589 --> 00:25:51.724
Something less in your face.

516
00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:53.856
More respectful.

517
00:25:55.292 --> 00:25:57.599
Sure.

518
00:25:57.643 --> 00:26:00.341
Why don't I start over?

519
00:26:01.821 --> 00:26:03.562
-Yeah.

520
00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:05.172
Okay.

521
00:26:18.359 --> 00:26:20.143
It's not bad.

522
00:26:34.244 --> 00:26:36.246
I'll draw up new plans,

523
00:26:36.290 --> 00:26:38.684
and you'll have them
in the next two weeks.

524
00:26:38.727 --> 00:26:41.121
Great.
We look forward to it.

525
00:26:41.164 --> 00:26:42.470
Mr. Grey.

526
00:26:42.513 --> 00:26:43.602
Thanks, Gia.

527
00:26:44.690 --> 00:26:45.995
Mrs. Grey.

528
00:26:51.218 --> 00:26:53.089
-This is gonna be fun.

529
00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:54.917
I'm paying for extra security,

530
00:26:54.961 --> 00:26:56.745
and you're scarier
than any of them.

531
00:26:56.789 --> 00:26:58.660
-Here.

532
00:27:00.227 --> 00:27:03.099
You could handle her,
you can handle this.

533
00:27:03.143 --> 00:27:05.188
♪

534
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:20.377
Whoa, Ana.

535
00:27:20.421 --> 00:27:21.422
Easy. Ana!

536
00:27:24.947 --> 00:27:26.340
Sure beats Wanda.

537
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.134
We've lost Taylor and Sawyer.

538
00:27:38.178 --> 00:27:40.484
Slackers.

539
00:27:40.528 --> 00:27:42.791
-I'm a race car driver.

540

541
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:48.928
The SUV. I see it.

542
00:27:51.887 --> 00:27:53.454
We're being followed.

543
00:27:53.497 --> 00:27:54.890
That Dodge?

544
00:27:54.934 --> 00:27:56.892
Sawyer ran the plates.
They're fake.

545
00:27:56.936 --> 00:27:58.677
-Lose him.

546
00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:00.417

straight up?

732

Honestly, I don't know
if I want to know the answer.

1066
00:58:14.621 --> 00:58:16.275
It's a miracle he talks at all.

1067
00:58:16.318 --> 00:58:18.233
When Mom and Dad
first brought him home,

1068
00:58:18.277 --> 00:58:19.800
he never spoke.

1069
00:58:19.844 --> 00:58:22.281
He didn't cry.
I mean, he's never cried.

1070
00:58:22.324 --> 00:58:23.935

1071
00:58:23.978 --> 00:58:25.589

wasn't looking, though.

1072

1077
00:58:36.425 --> 00:58:38.863

00:58:51.223 --> 00:58:53.355

00:58:53.399 --> 00:58:55.967
Well, guess we could go back
through town.

1085
00:58:56.010 --> 00:58:58.796
I got some errands to run, too.

1086
00:59:00.145 --> 00:59:01.755
Sir.

1087
00:59:01.799 --> 00:59:03.235
This just came in.

1088
00:59:03.278 --> 00:59:05.411
More background on Hyde.

1089
00:59:05.454 --> 00:59:07.239
Went to Princeton
on a scholarship,

1090
00:59:07.282 --> 00:59:09.241
graduated summa cum laude.

1091
00:59:09.284 --> 00:59:10.590
Smart guy.

1092
00:59:10.634 --> 00:59:11.852
Worked for publishers

1093
00:59:11.896 --> 00:59:14.463
in New York and Chicago
before S.I.P.

1094
00:59:14.507 --> 00:59:16.248
What else?

1095
00:59:16.291 --> 00:59:17.945
We tracked down
an ex-assistant.

1096
00:59:17.989 --> 00:59:19.512
Seems Hyde slept with her.

1097
00:59:19.556 --> 00:59:22.080
Made a sex tape,
used it to blackmail her.

1098
00:59:22.123 --> 00:59:23.385
Jesus.

1099
00:59:23.429 --> 00:59:24.735
Has she told the police?

1100
00:59:24.778 --> 00:59:26.258
She wouldn't go on record.

1101
00:59:26.301 --> 00:59:27.999
And another thing--
apparently, Hyde was

1102
00:59:28.042 --> 00:59:30.262
in and out of foster homes
in Detroit.

1103
00:59:30.305 --> 00:59:31.916
So was I.

1104
00:59:33.047 --> 00:59:34.396
Good work.

1105
00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:35.572
-Keep digging.
-Sir.

1106
00:59:35.615 --> 00:59:36.616
And, Taylor...

1107
00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:38.009
Ana's still shaken up.

1108
00:59:38.052 --> 00:59:39.488
Not a word about this for now.

1109
00:59:39.532 --> 00:59:41.055
Yes, sir.

1110
00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.497
Oh, yes!

1111
00:59:48.541 --> 00:59:49.847
-I don't know.

1112
00:59:49.890 --> 00:59:52.371
It's really low in the back.

1113
00:59:52.414 --> 00:59:54.416
-It's hot.
-Yeah, but...

1114
00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:57.376
Oh, Christian's gonna
love this dress.

1115
00:59:57.419 --> 00:59:59.726
Help. My zipper is stuck.

1116
00:59:59.770 --> 01:00:00.858
Oh.

1117
01:00:00.901 --> 01:00:01.946
Let me see.

1118
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:23.184
-Ta-da!

1119
01:00:23.228 --> 01:00:24.664
What do you think?

1120
01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.100
Oh, my God.

1121
01:00:26.144 --> 01:00:27.449
I know.

1122
01:00:27.493 --> 01:00:28.842
Look at you.
You're like a valentine.

1123
01:00:28.886 --> 01:00:30.061
-Turn around.

1124
01:00:30.104 --> 01:00:31.802
-Look at her.

1125
01:00:31.845 --> 01:00:33.281
-Elliot's gonna love it.
-He's gonna love it.

1126
01:00:33.325 --> 01:00:34.848
Mm. Oh!

1127
01:00:34.892 --> 01:00:36.415
-Shoes.
-Shoes!

1128
01:00:36.458 --> 01:00:38.547
-Let's have a drink.
-Mm. Oh!

1129
01:00:38.591 --> 01:00:40.549
-Oh, girl, look at you.

1130
01:00:40.593 --> 01:00:42.813
Here you go. I know,
it's kind of like a napkin.

1131
01:00:47.818 --> 01:00:50.559
Tell me you didn't wear that
to go hiking.

1132
01:00:50.603 --> 01:00:52.257
Of course I did.

1133
01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:53.693
I did.

1134
01:00:53.737 --> 01:00:56.087
It's, um...

1135
01:00:56.130 --> 01:00:59.351
good for sweating and...

1136
01:00:59.394 --> 01:01:01.440
has full range of motion.

1137
01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:03.094
It's very short.

1138
01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:04.617
I know.

1139
01:01:06.401 --> 01:01:08.099
And it's not
too far from here...

1140
01:01:10.405 --> 01:01:12.886
...to here...

1141
01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:16.281
-to there.

-And to here.

1143

So just don't bend over.

1144
01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:22.635
We should be fine.

1145
01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.161

01:01:27.205 --> 01:01:29.424

in town today, Gina?

1151

Um...

1161

At a certain point, uh,

the idea of spending
the rest of my life

1163
01:02:12.772 --> 01:02:17.951
with one person
seemed unimaginable.

1164
01:02:17.995 --> 01:02:21.781
And then I met Kate.

1165
01:02:21.825 --> 01:02:24.697
And I fell head over heels
in love.

1166
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:31.791

and there is

1227

I'm sorry, Mrs. Grey,

1228
01:05:34.582 --> 01:05:38.195
but my lieutenant asked me
to check something out.

1229
01:05:38.238 --> 01:05:40.675
Jack Hyde claims you and him
were sleeping together

1230

when he worked at S.I.P.

-He tried to break it off,

1232
01:05:45.071 --> 01:05:47.378
you got upset,
and you made up this whole

1233
01:05:47.421 --> 01:05:48.857
sexual assault story
to get him fired.

1234
01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:51.164
! -Says he came
to your apartment to try

1235
01:05:51.208 --> 01:05:52.992
and straighten things out,
but your security people

1236
01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.776
got involved
and it all went south.

1237
01:05:54.820 --> 01:05:56.691
No, that is complete bullshit.

1238
01:05:56.735 --> 01:05:58.563
I'll put that down as a denial.

1239
01:05:58.606 --> 01:06:00.782
-Jack attacked me.
-Right.

1240
01:06:00.826 --> 01:06:03.307
He attacked me,
and then he tried to kidnap me.

1241
01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:04.873
Do you believe
what he's saying?

1242
01:06:04.917 --> 01:06:06.614
Officially, Mrs. Grey,

1243
01:06:06.658 --> 01:06:08.312
it doesn't matter
what I believe.

1244
01:06:09.487 --> 01:06:11.054
Unofficially,

1245
01:06:11.097 --> 01:06:13.012
I believe Hyde
is a lying piece of shit

1246
01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:15.362
who will say anything
to get bail.

1247
01:06:15.406 --> 01:06:17.060
You need to be ready for that.

1248
01:06:17.103 --> 01:06:18.452
Thank you for your time.

1249
01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:20.411
Wait, Jack is applying
for bail?

1250
01:06:20.454 --> 01:06:23.457
Noon today,
municipal courthouse.

1251
01:06:27.374 --> 01:06:30.073
Does your client deny forcing
entry into this penthouse?

1252
01:06:30.116 --> 01:06:32.510
He does not, Your Honor.
However, my client

1253
01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:34.947
had exhausted all legitimate
means of redress

1254
01:06:34.991 --> 01:06:36.470
and merely wanted to confront

1255
01:06:36.514 --> 01:06:38.255
the parties responsible
for destroying his career.

1256
01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:41.040
I think he wanted to do more
than confront them, counselor.

1257
01:06:41.084 --> 01:06:45.175
These are not the actions of an
innocent man seeking redress.

1258
01:06:45.218 --> 01:06:48.134
However,
given his clean record,

1259
01:06:48.178 --> 01:06:49.875
the court will grant bail.

1260
01:06:49.918 --> 01:06:52.095
-Set at $500,000.
-Your Honor.

1261
01:06:52.138 --> 01:06:53.661
Next case.

1262
01:06:55.707 --> 01:06:57.752
Okay.

1263
01:06:57.796 --> 01:06:59.319
Let's go.

1264
01:07:58.378 --> 01:07:59.858
Hello.

1265
01:07:59.901 --> 01:08:01.425
Mrs. Grey,
I've caught you at last.

1266
01:08:01.468 --> 01:08:03.731
This is Dr. Greene.

1267
01:08:03.775 --> 01:08:07.387
Dr. Greene, uh, I'm sorry
I haven't called you back.

1268
01:08:07.431 --> 01:08:10.303
That's okay, but you've missed
your last two appointments.

1269
01:08:10.347 --> 01:08:12.566
Can you come to my office
this afternoon?

1270
01:08:15.047 --> 01:08:17.136
I did leave a lot of messages.

1271
01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:19.399
I know.
I-I've been so busy,

1272
01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.967
it just kind of
slipped through the cracks.

1273
01:08:22.010 --> 01:08:23.316
Hmm.

1274
01:08:23.360 --> 01:08:24.926
Before we start...

1275
01:08:36.677 --> 01:08:39.071
It seems you're pregnant,
Mrs. Grey.

1276
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.773
It's, uh... I'm...

1277
01:08:45.817 --> 01:08:47.123
What?

1278
01:08:47.166 --> 01:08:49.603
The shot is almost
100% effective

1279
01:08:49.647 --> 01:08:51.953
when administered regularly.

1280
01:08:55.914 --> 01:08:57.176
-There.

1281
01:08:57.220 --> 01:08:58.743
Its heartbeat.

1282
01:08:59.874 --> 01:09:01.049
Where?

1283
01:09:01.093 --> 01:09:04.052
Just there.

1284
01:09:05.576 --> 01:09:07.795
It's just like a little blip.

1285
01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:10.233
I'd say it's six, seven weeks.

1286
01:09:10.276 --> 01:09:12.539
:
Little blip.

1287
01:09:12.583 --> 01:09:14.541
How'd it go today?

1288
01:09:14.585 --> 01:09:18.415
Uh, good. I got a visit
from Detective Clark.

1289
01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:24.377
Apparently, Hyde is trying
to say that I came on to him.

1290
01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:26.684
He expects people
to believe that?

1291
01:09:26.727 --> 01:09:28.642
It's his word against mine.

1292
01:09:33.604 --> 01:09:35.693
Is that what's bothering you?

1293
01:09:35.736 --> 01:09:38.652
Ana, no one will believe him.

1294
01:09:38.696 --> 01:09:41.089
And the other assistants,
they'll tell the detectives

1295
01:09:41.133 --> 01:09:42.874
-he did the same...
-I'm pregnant.

1296
01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:48.227
Six or seven weeks.

1297
01:09:52.492 --> 01:09:54.886
You forgot your shot?

1298
01:09:57.018 --> 01:09:58.585
Christ, Ana.

1299
01:09:58.629 --> 01:10:00.370
I'm sorry.

1300
01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:01.719
I know it's not good timing.

1301
01:10:01.762 --> 01:10:03.416
I had plans for us.

1302
01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:04.896
I wanted to give you the world,

1303
01:10:04.939 --> 01:10:07.768
not diapers and vomit
and shit.

1304
01:10:10.684 --> 01:10:13.426
Do you really think
that I'm ready to be a father?

1305
01:10:13.470 --> 01:10:16.124
No. I don't.

1306
01:10:16.168 --> 01:10:18.257
And I'm not ready
to be a mother, either,

1307
01:10:18.301 --> 01:10:19.911
but we'll just figure it out.

1308
01:10:22.827 --> 01:10:25.873

Why are you behaving like this?

1384
01:16:27.321 --> 01:16:28.714
I don't know.
Maybe you should go

1385
01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:30.542
ask your friend, Mrs. Robinson.

1386
01:16:31.674 --> 01:16:33.763
What?

1387
01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.416

1388
01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:38.506
I've been picking up your shit,
Christian.

1389
01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:40.508
I told you we're just friends.

1390
01:16:40.552 --> 01:16:43.120
The time for talking to me
was yesterday.

1391
01:16:43.163 --> 01:16:46.166
But instead, you decided
to go get drunk with the woman

1392
01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:49.213
who taught you how to fuck
when you were a child.

1393
01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:53.609
The going gets rough,
and you go running to her.

1394
01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:57.569
I thought you were better
than that.

1395
01:16:57.613 --> 01:16:59.049
It wasn't like that.

1396
01:17:09.973 --> 01:17:11.539
Did you sleep with her?

1397
01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:13.324
No. What do you think,
I'd cheat on you?

1398
01:17:13.367 --> 01:17:14.717
You did.

1399
01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.937
You confided in her
about our private life.

1400
01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:20.026
You chose her over me.

1401
01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.943
And then you came home,

1402
01:17:23.987 --> 01:17:26.772
and you said that I would
choose this baby over you.

1403
01:17:28.295 --> 01:17:31.168
And you know what?
If I have to, I will.

1404
01:17:32.517 --> 01:17:35.085
I will choose this baby
over anybody

1405
01:17:35.128 --> 01:17:38.566
because that is what
decent parents do.

1406
01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:41.047
It's what your mother
should have done for you,

1407
01:17:41.091 --> 01:17:43.702
and I am so sorry
that she didn't, Christian.

1408
01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.704
I am sorry.

1409
01:17:45.748 --> 01:17:48.838
But you are not a kid anymore,
Christian.

1410
01:17:48.881 --> 01:17:51.405
You need to grow the fuck up.

1411
01:18:03.896 --> 01:18:06.290
You're not happy
about this baby.

1412
01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:07.770
I got that.

1413
01:18:07.813 --> 01:18:09.772
I am not ecstatic, either,

1414
01:18:09.815 --> 01:18:12.078
given the timing
and your reaction.

1415
01:18:12.122 --> 01:18:14.515
But babies happen
when you have sex,

1416
01:18:14.559 --> 01:18:17.040
and you and I tend
to do a lot of that.

1417
01:18:18.389 --> 01:18:21.044
So we can either
do this together...

1418
01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:24.743
...or I will do it without you.

1419
01:18:24.787 --> 01:18:26.527
And what about us?

1420
01:18:26.571 --> 01:18:30.270
Well, when your husband prefers
the company of his ex-mistress,

1421
01:18:30.314 --> 01:18:32.838
it doesn't really say much
for your marriage, does it?

1422
01:18:32.882 --> 01:18:34.710
Elena and I just talked.

1423
01:18:34.753 --> 01:18:36.363
I was too angry with you.

1424
01:18:36.407 --> 01:18:38.061
I'm angry with you, Christian.

1425
01:18:38.104 --> 01:18:39.584

You fucked up.

1427
01:18:42.021 --> 01:18:43.849
Yes, I fucked up,
and I'm sorry.

1428
01:18:43.893 --> 01:18:46.330
I'm standing here
telling you I'm sorry.

1429
01:18:46.373 --> 01:18:48.245
Okay, she doesn't...

1430
01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:50.638
she doesn't mean anything

1431
01:18:50.682 --> 01:18:52.597

1432

01:19:25.804 --> 01:19:27.023
Hey.

1441
01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:28.589
Kate Kavanagh
called you three times.

1442
01:19:28.633 --> 01:19:30.548
And your husband called.
He wanted me to remind you

1443
01:19:30.591 --> 01:19:32.811
that he is flying down
to Portland, but he'll be back

1444
01:19:32.855 --> 01:19:34.465
-this afternoon.

1445
01:19:34.508 --> 01:19:36.467
-Yeah.

1446
01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:38.469
Are you okay?
Can I get you a latte?

1447
01:19:38.512 --> 01:19:40.166
No, thank you.

1448
01:19:40.210 --> 01:19:41.820
Ana Grey's office.

1449
01:19:41.864 --> 01:19:43.604
-Hey, Hannah, it's Kate.
-Miss Kavanagh.

1450
01:19:43.648 --> 01:19:45.345
Yes, she is.

1451
01:19:45.389 --> 01:19:47.565
Give me one moment,
and I'll transfer you.

1452
01:19:53.832 --> 01:19:55.181
Kate.

1453
01:19:55.225 --> 01:19:56.835
Hey.
Christian's looking for you.

1454
01:19:56.879 --> 01:19:58.837
He called me at like 6:00 a.m.

1455
01:19:58.881 --> 01:20:00.970
Uh, it's fine. He found me.

1456
01:20:01.013 --> 01:20:03.407
What's going on

1457
01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:05.626
Mm-hmm. I'm just at work,
and I'm so busy.

Can I call you back?

Okay.

1460
01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:10.806
But, hey, you know I'm here
for you, right?

1461
01:20:11.894 --> 01:20:12.938
:
I know.

1462
01:20:12.982 --> 01:20:15.332
Oh, Ana.

1463

Kate, don't.

Yeah.

Bye.

Hi, Mia.

Damn, it's good
to hear your voice.

Jack?

1470
01:20:51.890 --> 01:20:53.544
We never got a chance
to talk last week.

1471
01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:54.937
How the hell are you?

1472

How are you calling me?

1473

-You should be in j...

1474
01:20:59.115 --> 01:21:01.465
I'm out on bail, sweetheart.

1475
01:21:02.901 --> 01:21:04.729

Yeah. Cool spec, too.

1478
01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:10.778
Zeiss lens.

1479

-20-megapixel camera.

Yeah, I picked her up
outside the gym.

1482

security never learns.

1483

Christian Grey.

I'm smarter.

I've got more balls than him.
He had it so easy.

1487
01:21:30.059 --> 01:21:31.408
They should have picked me.

than two hours, Jack.

to take my job.

Or you'll get his little sister
back in pieces.

01:30:54.187 --> 01:30:55.362
and it's headed east.

1619
01:31:00.150 --> 01:31:01.499
Liz, what are you doing?

1620
01:31:01.543 --> 01:31:03.066
Why are you doing this?

1621
01:31:03.109 --> 01:31:04.937
-Shut up.

1622
01:31:04.981 --> 01:31:06.809
They're at Fourth and
South Michigan, heading south.

1623
01:31:06.852 --> 01:31:08.811
Fourth and Michigan.

1624
01:31:08.854 --> 01:31:10.682
Roger that.
All units be advised,

1625
01:31:10.726 --> 01:31:12.292
suspect vehicle
is a blue Durango

1626
01:31:12.336 --> 01:31:14.207
headed south on Fourth
through Georgetown.

1627
01:31:17.559 --> 01:31:19.474
Taylor, right here.

1628
01:31:19.517 --> 01:31:21.171
Over the bridge to South Park.

1629
01:31:35.577 --> 01:31:37.492
-Oh, my God.

1630
01:31:40.582 --> 01:31:42.235
-Mia.

1631
01:31:42.279 --> 01:31:43.889
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1632
01:31:43.933 --> 01:31:45.456
No. No.

1633
01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.892
You made it.

1634
01:31:46.936 --> 01:31:48.546
-20 minutes to spare.
-Jack, I brought you

1635
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:50.330
all the money.
It's all in the car.

1636
01:31:50.374 --> 01:31:53.377
-Just let me have Mia.
-We'll get to that.

1637
01:31:53.420 --> 01:31:54.813
Did you lose her phone?

1638
01:31:54.857 --> 01:31:57.990
Yeah, in the alleyway
by the bank.

1639
01:31:58.034 --> 01:32:00.515
-Good.

1640
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:04.170
They're stopped.

1641
01:32:04.214 --> 01:32:05.563
The signal stopped.

1642
01:32:05.607 --> 01:32:07.434
Carrie Street, north.
Ten blocks. Hurry.

1643
01:32:07.478 --> 01:32:09.524
We have two units
converging on that area.

1644
01:32:09.567 --> 01:32:10.786
With you in three minutes.

1645
01:32:14.311 --> 01:32:16.574
Jack, please just let us go.

1646
01:32:18.315 --> 01:32:20.796
That's for SIP,
you stuck-up little bitch.

1647
01:32:20.839 --> 01:32:22.841
Thanks for fucking up my life.

1648
01:32:24.321 --> 01:32:26.584
Jesus, Jack, stop.

1649
01:32:26.628 --> 01:32:29.587
I did what you wanted.
I gave you what you asked for.

1650
01:32:29.631 --> 01:32:30.980
You think you can humiliate me?

1651
01:32:31.023 --> 01:32:32.416
-No.
-You bitch!

1652
01:32:33.765 --> 01:32:35.245
Where's Christian now,
Ana, huh?

1653
01:32:35.288 --> 01:32:36.463
Jack, don't.

1654
01:32:36.507 --> 01:32:38.161
You said you wouldn't kill her.

1655
01:32:38.204 --> 01:32:40.293
And she's not dead.
Not yet.

1656
01:32:40.337 --> 01:32:41.730
You have the money.
Leave her. Let's go.

1657
01:32:41.773 --> 01:32:43.296
Fuck the money.
I don't give a shit

1658
01:32:43.340 --> 01:32:44.471
-about the money.
-Enough.

1659
01:32:56.658 --> 01:32:58.268
All units, cell phone signal

1660
01:32:58.311 --> 01:33:00.270
has been triangulated
to South Park, east of...

1661
01:33:00.313 --> 01:33:02.272
Taylor, grab Mia.

1662
01:33:02.315 --> 01:33:04.622
Ana

1663
01:33:04.666 --> 01:33:06.450
Ana, can you hear me?

1664
01:33:06.493 --> 01:33:08.234
Stay with me, Ana.

1665
01:33:08.278 --> 01:33:10.802
Breathe. Breathe.

1666
01:33:10.846 --> 01:33:13.805
Stay with me, Ana. Ana.

1667
01:33:16.939 --> 01:33:18.593
Please be careful.

1668
01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:20.551
She's pregnant.

1669
01:33:23.293 --> 01:33:24.816
Please stay back, Mr. Grey.

1670
01:33:24.860 --> 01:33:26.601
Let us help your wife.

1671
01:33:59.416 --> 01:34:02.114
I was so awful to her, Mom.

1672
01:34:02.158 --> 01:34:05.552
The things I said,
I want to take 'em all back.

1673
01:34:07.642 --> 01:34:09.600
Sweetheart, if there was

1674
01:34:09.644 --> 01:34:11.428
no room in marriage
for mistakes,

1675
01:34:11.471 --> 01:34:14.561
none of them would last
more than a week.

1676
01:34:14.605 --> 01:34:16.433
Tell her you're sorry.

1677
01:34:16.476 --> 01:34:18.217
And mean it.

1678
01:34:18.261 --> 01:34:20.176
Then give her a little time.

1679
01:34:21.612 --> 01:34:23.353
I thought she was leaving me.

1680
01:34:23.396 --> 01:34:26.138
Not this one.

1681
01:34:26.182 --> 01:34:28.619
She's tenacious.

1682
01:34:28.663 --> 01:34:31.535
Especially about things
that she loves.

1683
01:34:31.578 --> 01:34:33.972
And she does love you,
Christian.

1684
01:34:35.757 --> 01:34:38.542
You know that, don't you?

1685
01:34:38.585 --> 01:34:40.283
Yeah.

1686
01:34:40.326 --> 01:34:41.632
Yeah, I do.

1687
01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:43.242
Good.

1688
01:34:47.725 --> 01:34:49.640
Oh, sweetheart.

1689
01:35:02.566 --> 01:35:05.047
- Anastasia.
- I'll call Dr. Bartlet.

1690
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:06.613
Hey.

1691
01:35:06.657 --> 01:35:08.572
How are you feeling?

1692
01:35:11.357 --> 01:35:13.533
Is the baby...
the baby's okay?

1693
01:35:13.577 --> 01:35:15.753
The baby's fine.

1694
01:35:15.797 --> 01:35:17.799
Baby's fine.

1695
01:35:17.842 --> 01:35:19.670
Thank God.

1696
01:35:22.194 --> 01:35:23.979
Is Mia okay?

1697
01:35:24.022 --> 01:35:26.068
Yes.

1698
01:35:26.111 --> 01:35:27.722
Mia's fine.

1699
01:35:33.466 --> 01:35:35.033
Hey.

1700
01:35:44.042 --> 01:35:48.133
Ana, I want to have
this baby with you.

1701
01:35:48.177 --> 01:35:50.875
I was just scared.

1702
01:35:50.919 --> 01:35:54.618
I wanted your world
to begin and end with me.

1703
01:35:54.661 --> 01:35:56.489
It does.

1704
01:35:58.753 --> 01:36:00.102
Christian, it does.

1705
01:36:00.145 --> 01:36:01.799
You're my whole life.

1706
01:36:05.890 --> 01:36:07.500
Are you crying?

1707
01:36:09.241 --> 01:36:11.156
-Come here.

1708
01:36:26.824 --> 01:36:29.305
Why didn't you tell me
what was going on?

1709
01:36:31.176 --> 01:36:32.395
I couldn't.

1710
01:36:33.526 --> 01:36:35.093
Jack threatened me.

1711
01:36:35.137 --> 01:36:36.834
What happened to him?

1712
01:36:36.878 --> 01:36:38.880
He'll live.

1713
01:36:38.923 --> 01:36:41.708
I can't believe
I shot somebody.

1714
01:36:41.752 --> 01:36:43.101
You should have aimed higher.

1715
01:36:46.888 --> 01:36:48.498
Liz was helping him.

1716
01:36:48.541 --> 01:36:50.326
Blackmail.

1717
01:36:50.369 --> 01:36:53.198
She had sex with Hyde,
and he filmed it.

1718
01:36:53.242 --> 01:36:56.288
Seems he did that
with all his assistants.

1719
01:36:56.332 --> 01:36:58.247
Oh, my God.

1720
01:37:04.688 --> 01:37:08.083
I know you think you're gonna
be a really shitty dad.

1721
01:37:09.214 --> 01:37:10.868
But you're not.

1722
01:37:13.218 --> 01:37:14.872
This baby's gonna love you.

1723
01:37:16.047 --> 01:37:18.571
Unconditionally.

1724
01:37:21.183 --> 01:37:23.272
Just like you loved
your mother.

1725
01:37:25.927 --> 01:37:28.320
You just have to forgive her.

1726
01:37:31.671 --> 01:37:33.021
Shares in Lincoln Industries

1727
01:37:33.064 --> 01:37:34.936
were suspended today
on news of a hostile takeover

1728
01:37:34.979 --> 01:37:36.938
by Seattle entrepreneur
Christian Grey.

1729
01:37:36.981 --> 01:37:38.853
The announcement came
on the same day

1730
01:37:38.896 --> 01:37:41.377
founder and CEO John Lincoln
was fired by his own board.

1731
01:37:41.420 --> 01:37:44.032
It's alleged Lincoln
misused company finances

1732
01:37:44.075 --> 01:37:46.425
-to post bail for one Jack Hyde,

1733
01:37:46.469 --> 01:37:48.514
currently under arrest
on charges

1734
01:37:48.558 --> 01:37:50.386
of kidnapping and extortion.

1735
01:37:50.429 --> 01:37:52.214
A spokesperson
for Grey Enterprises

1736
01:37:52.257 --> 01:37:54.651
said Lincoln Industries would
be broken up and its assets...

1737
01:38:00.178 --> 01:38:03.747
What is happening?
Are you cooking?

1738
01:38:03.790 --> 01:38:05.444
:
Yeah. I got this.

1739
01:38:06.968 --> 01:38:08.708
Prepare to be amazed.

1740
01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:13.104
Shit.

1741
01:38:17.282 --> 01:38:18.805
What's this?

1742
01:38:18.849 --> 01:38:19.981
It's more information on Hyde.

1743
01:38:20.024 --> 01:38:22.070
Open it.

1744
01:38:25.029 --> 01:38:26.901
Whoa.

1745
01:38:28.163 --> 01:38:30.905
Look at his foster family.

1746
01:38:36.736 --> 01:38:38.260
That's Hyde.

1747
01:38:38.303 --> 01:38:39.914
That's me.

1748
01:38:39.957 --> 01:38:41.698
You were in foster care
with him?

1749
01:38:41.741 --> 01:38:43.918
I must have been.

1750
01:38:43.961 --> 01:38:45.049
Do you remember these people?

1751
01:38:45.093 --> 01:38:46.659
Do you know these kids?

1752
01:38:46.703 --> 01:38:48.270
I barely remember anything
before I was adopted.

1753
01:38:48.313 --> 01:38:49.575
I was too young.

1754
01:38:49.619 --> 01:38:50.968
That must have been
what he meant

1755
01:38:51.012 --> 01:38:52.752
when he said
that you owe him a life.

1756
01:38:52.796 --> 01:38:55.886
Because your parents
adopted you and not him.

1757
01:39:05.548 --> 01:39:06.941
What's going on?

1758
01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:14.165
If I'd been left in the system,

1759
01:39:14.209 --> 01:39:16.820
who knows how I
would have turned out?

1760
01:39:16.863 --> 01:39:19.823
That could be me.
Maybe that should have been me.

1761
01:39:19.866 --> 01:39:21.651
Hey. No.

1762
01:39:21.694 --> 01:39:24.436
You are nothing like him.

1763
01:39:26.395 --> 01:39:30.355
You were given a life
with advantages, yes, but...

1764
01:39:30.399 --> 01:39:32.227
look what you made of it.

1765
01:39:34.142 --> 01:39:36.318
You're a man of honor.

1766
01:39:37.884 --> 01:39:40.191
And you treat people well.

1767
01:39:40.235 --> 01:39:41.801
You care.

1768
01:39:41.845 --> 01:39:44.848
No one could ever say that
about a man like Hyde.

1769
01:39:44.891 --> 01:39:46.850
No matter who raised him.

1770
01:39:50.941 --> 01:39:52.725
I love you.

1771
01:39:54.292 --> 01:39:56.164
Now, if you could only cook.

1772
01:39:56.207 --> 01:39:58.296
-You'd be perfect.
-Oh, God.

1773
01:39:58.340 --> 01:39:59.863
Okay.

1774
01:40:03.867 --> 01:40:04.999
Fuck it.

1775
01:40:05.042 --> 01:40:07.001
Let's get takeout.

1776
01:40:13.050 --> 01:40:15.835
-Yeah.

1777
01:40:15.879 --> 01:40:17.707
It seems that they've found

1778
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:20.014

is buried.
