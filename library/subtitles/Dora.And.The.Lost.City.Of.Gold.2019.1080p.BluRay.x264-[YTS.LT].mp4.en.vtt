Oh, man! Ooh!

00:01:57.883 --> 00:02:00.018
<i>Dora the Explorer!</i>

00:02:06.157 --> 00:02:08.625
Dora! Diego!
It's time for dinner.

00:02:08.627 --> 00:02:11.227
But, Mami,
we're about to explore.

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.129
No. Now come on.

00:02:13.131 --> 00:02:14.830
Besides,
Diego has to be up early tomorrow.

00:02:14.832 --> 00:02:16.333
He's moving to the city,
remember?

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:18.200
His mom has a new job.

00:02:18.202 --> 00:02:20.904
Oh, yeah. I remember.

00:02:20.906 --> 00:02:22.871
Dora, what did we say
about dressing up Boots?

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.946
He's a wild monkey, honey.
He's not meant to be in human clothes.

00:02:32.984 --> 00:02:36.022
- This is delicious!
- Wow, this is good.

00:02:36.987 --> 00:02:39.057
- Mmm!
- <i>¡Delicioso!</i>

00:02:40.092 --> 00:02:42.795
Can you say <i>"delicioso"?</i>

00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:47.633
Say <i>"delicioso"!</i>

00:02:49.801 --> 00:02:51.571
She'll grow out of it.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.073
Mmm.

00:02:54.873 --> 00:02:56.542
<i>¡Delicioso!</i>

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.711
Don't start.
Just gotta let it go.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:04.048
Tío, what is Parapata?

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.018
Parapata
is a great Inca legend.

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:09.921
An ancient city...

00:03:10.623 --> 00:03:13.055
now lost in time.

00:03:13.057 --> 00:03:14.858
Explorers for hundreds of years

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:16.359
have been searching for it
in vain.

00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.096
And, well, ever since
we moved here to the jungle,

00:03:19.098 --> 00:03:20.496
we've been trying to find it.

00:03:20.498 --> 00:03:22.065
Is there gold there?

00:03:22.067 --> 00:03:24.967
Stories say
there's more gold there

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.005
than the rest of the world
combined.

00:03:28.506 --> 00:03:31.107
So when we find it,
do we get to keep the gold?

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:34.244
- Um...
- No, no. Nobody keeps the gold.

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:37.680
We want to document Parapata
for archeological purposes.

00:03:37.682 --> 00:03:40.283
See, we're explorers,
we're not treasure hunters.

00:03:40.285 --> 00:03:44.623
And as explorers, well,
then the discovery of new places...

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:46.891
that's the treasure.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:49.793
- What?
- I don't get it.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:52.128
Okay, Cole, honey,
they're six.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.496
Treasure hunting bad,
exploring good.

00:03:54.498 --> 00:03:55.932
- Oh.
- Okay.

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:57.000
I just said that!

00:03:57.002 --> 00:03:59.237
Eh. Not really.

00:04:00.171 --> 00:04:02.805
I bet the lost city of Parapata

00:04:02.807 --> 00:04:05.709
has golden statues
of jungle cats.

00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:07.911
And monkeys.
Like Boots.

00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:09.513
Monkeys are the best.

00:04:09.515 --> 00:04:11.847
No way!
Jaguars are way cooler.

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.952
Monkeys can swing
and climb and talk to us.

00:04:15.486 --> 00:04:16.686
No, they can't.

00:04:16.688 --> 00:04:17.854
Boots isn't talking to you.

00:04:17.856 --> 00:04:19.022
He can talk.

00:04:19.024 --> 00:04:21.924
I know better!
I'm older than you.

00:04:21.926 --> 00:04:24.094
I think
you're just yelling at me

00:04:24.096 --> 00:04:25.895
because you're sad
you're leaving.

00:04:25.897 --> 00:04:28.700
Of course that's why
I'm yelling at you.

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:56.594
Keep this.
Best friends forever.

00:04:57.428 --> 00:04:59.263
Until our next
adventure, <i>prima.</i>

00:05:00.032 --> 00:05:02.101
Till our next adventure,
<i>primo.</i>

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.270
- Come on, Diego.
- <i>Vamos.</i>

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.174
<i>Adiós, Dora.</i>

00:05:24.388 --> 00:05:25.457
Diego!

00:05:38.936 --> 00:05:42.972
Hi! I'm Dora! And I'm being chased
by a herd of angry pygmy elephants.

00:05:42.974 --> 00:05:45.410
Can you say,
"angry pygmy elephants"?

00:05:48.813 --> 00:05:51.217
Better luck next
time, angry elephants.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.654
Pardon me, black caiman...

00:05:57.388 --> 00:05:59.791
largest predator in the Amazon.

00:06:00.491 --> 00:06:01.960
Aw, babies.

00:06:02.794 --> 00:06:05.164
Bye!

00:06:07.532 --> 00:06:08.664
And that's Boots!

00:06:08.666 --> 00:06:10.032
Hi, Boots.

00:06:10.034 --> 00:06:12.368
"Hi, Dora.
What's today's adventure?"

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.142
Today, we continue our
decades-long search for Parapata.

00:06:16.775 --> 00:06:18.777
Ooh, look!

00:06:20.546 --> 00:06:22.412
Golden poison frog.

00:06:22.414 --> 00:06:25.982
Its skin is lethally toxic and
can cause full-body paralysis.

00:06:25.984 --> 00:06:28.620
Can you say,
"severe neurotoxicity"?

00:06:29.787 --> 00:06:32.424
Bye, deadly frog. Have a nice day.

00:06:36.327 --> 00:06:38.662
Oh! A rockfall!

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.431
This cave wasn't here before.

00:06:50.976 --> 00:06:53.809
Sorry, hairy-legged
vampire bat family.

00:06:58.717 --> 00:07:00.116
Ohh.

00:07:00.118 --> 00:07:01.886
Ancient Inca.

00:07:23.108 --> 00:07:25.878
Parapata.

00:07:32.818 --> 00:07:35.187
Come on, Boots.

00:07:36.755 --> 00:07:40.993
If you just believe in yourself,
anything is possible.

00:07:57.075 --> 00:07:58.907
I'm okay, Boots!

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:03.582
Uh... Could you maybe go and
get Mami and Papi for me?

00:08:09.154 --> 00:08:11.121
Hey, now can I see the statue?

00:08:11.123 --> 00:08:12.922
- Did you finish chopping the wood?
- Yeah.

00:08:12.924 --> 00:08:15.924
Honey, you scared us to death today.
If Boots hadn't found us...

00:08:15.926 --> 00:08:19.796
I'm sorry. It's just I'm pretty sure
it's from the reign of Pachacuti.

00:08:19.798 --> 00:08:22.032
I mean, the markings,
they look like some sort of...

00:08:22.034 --> 00:08:24.169
- Map.
- What?

00:08:25.871 --> 00:08:27.272
A map!

00:08:29.741 --> 00:08:31.110
This is it.

00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.880
This is the missing piece.

00:08:35.579 --> 00:08:37.915
We found Parapata!

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.055
Wait, why aren't you guys...
more excited?

00:08:43.388 --> 00:08:44.753
Uh...

00:08:44.755 --> 00:08:47.257
- You guys figured it out, didn't you?
- What?

00:08:47.259 --> 00:08:50.062
- You know where Parapata is.
- No.

00:08:50.962 --> 00:08:52.262
You red-tacked it.

00:08:52.264 --> 00:08:54.663
- We did?
- We never use the red tack.

00:08:54.665 --> 00:08:57.032
- You know where it is!
- We should have waited on the red tack.

00:08:57.034 --> 00:08:59.768
- Definitely, definitely bad call.
- Okay, we did figure it out.

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:02.305
- -The Inca
reached an area in Peru

00:09:02.307 --> 00:09:04.007
that nobody thought
was possible.

00:09:04.009 --> 00:09:07.643
And that's where your mother
and I are gonna find Parapata.

00:09:07.645 --> 00:09:09.048
And me.

00:09:10.981 --> 00:09:14.551
I'm sorry, sweetie, you're just not
ready, and you proved that to us today.

00:09:14.553 --> 00:09:16.152
No, no, no,
I'm ready, Mami...

00:09:16.154 --> 00:09:17.854
I'm sorry,
but we've made up our minds.

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:19.325
- Mami...
- No.

00:09:25.697 --> 00:09:26.966
Honey...

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.066
you do know the jungle.

00:09:30.068 --> 00:09:31.301
It's a part of you.

00:09:31.303 --> 00:09:33.369
But you're all alone
out there.

00:09:33.371 --> 00:09:35.338
And why is that a bad thing?

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:38.375
Because we won't always be there
to pull you up.

00:09:39.010 --> 00:09:41.547
Go to the city. Make friends.

00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.354
Dora, hurry!
You have a flight to catch.

00:09:52.356 --> 00:09:54.856
But I don't
want to go to the city.

00:09:54.858 --> 00:09:57.226
- I won't know anyone there.
- You'll know your family.

00:09:57.228 --> 00:10:00.830
Yeah, you used to be so close to Diego.
I'll bet he's missed you, too.

00:10:00.832 --> 00:10:04.734
- -The point is,
I think it would be good...

00:10:04.736 --> 00:10:07.570
for you to be in the world
around kids your own age.

00:10:07.572 --> 00:10:10.273
- It might help.
- Help what?

00:10:10.275 --> 00:10:12.609
Honey, you're wearing a boa
around your neck.

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:14.411
I know.

00:10:14.413 --> 00:10:17.148
- It's a boa... as a boa.
- That's funny.

00:10:18.716 --> 00:10:22.350
- Put the boa down.
- Honey, there's something else we gotta discuss.

00:10:22.352 --> 00:10:23.753
- I can handle this.
- Okay.

00:10:23.755 --> 00:10:25.053
Take a seat, young lady.

00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:26.490
- What's happening?
- Come on.

00:10:27.192 --> 00:10:28.590
We're gonna have a talk.

00:10:28.592 --> 00:10:30.625
About the dangers
of the big city.

00:10:30.627 --> 00:10:33.595
See, you're gonna be invited
to some parties.

00:10:33.597 --> 00:10:36.566
And some of these parties,
they're called "raves."

00:10:36.568 --> 00:10:38.334
The people there
are called ravers.

00:10:38.336 --> 00:10:41.104
Yeah, and they love glow sticks

00:10:41.106 --> 00:10:44.172
and candy necklaces
and Hacky Sacks.

00:10:44.174 --> 00:10:46.611
The music, it sounds like this:

00:10:56.154 --> 00:10:58.323
<i>♪ Can't stop it ♪</i>

00:11:10.399 --> 00:11:11.736
<i>♪ Go get it ♪</i>

00:11:13.771 --> 00:11:16.574
Yeah, it's very aggressive.
Very aggressive.

00:11:19.577 --> 00:11:20.611
Yeah.

00:11:21.712 --> 00:11:22.746
Okay.

00:11:23.747 --> 00:11:27.251
Well, be careful.
That's what we want to say.

00:11:28.953 --> 00:11:31.921
- I should've just said that.
- I think it would've been easier.

00:11:31.923 --> 00:11:34.657
Honey, here's your satellite phone.
Call us anytime.

00:11:34.659 --> 00:11:37.026
And you can track
our coordinates on your map.

00:11:37.028 --> 00:11:39.330
But it's not the same.

00:11:39.963 --> 00:11:41.897
I'm an explorer, like you.

00:11:41.899 --> 00:11:46.270
Oh, honey, you have
the whole world to explore!

00:11:46.837 --> 00:11:48.204
Go see it.

00:11:48.206 --> 00:11:50.005
Make friends.

00:11:50.007 --> 00:11:51.809
That's real exploring.

00:11:52.477 --> 00:11:53.909
But...

00:11:53.911 --> 00:11:55.177
I don't know how.

00:11:55.179 --> 00:11:57.248
Yes, you do.

00:11:58.082 --> 00:12:01.419
Just be yourself, Dora. Okay?

00:12:04.088 --> 00:12:06.424
Come on.
You're gonna miss your flight.

00:12:07.025 --> 00:12:08.459
<i>Te quiero.</i>

00:12:10.161 --> 00:12:11.628
Dora...

00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:14.466
no monkeys in the city.

00:12:17.635 --> 00:12:20.103
She knows, buddy.

00:12:46.564 --> 00:12:48.031
Wow!

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:50.735
Hi! I'm Dora! <i>¡Soy Dora!</i>

00:12:51.169 --> 00:12:52.701
I'm Dora! Hi!

00:12:52.703 --> 00:12:54.805
It's nice to meet you. Hi!

00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:02.244
- Do you see her?
- No.

00:13:02.246 --> 00:13:04.282
What if
we don't recognize her?

00:13:05.549 --> 00:13:06.916
Excuse me! Sorry!

00:13:06.918 --> 00:13:08.884
- Excuse me! Sorry!
- Hey, watch it!

00:13:08.886 --> 00:13:12.287
- I don't think that's gonna be a problem.
- Excuse me! Sorry!

00:13:12.289 --> 00:13:15.356
Dora! Welcome to the city.

00:13:15.358 --> 00:13:17.325
Tía Sabrina!

00:13:17.327 --> 00:13:19.262
- And Tío Nico!
- Dora!

00:13:19.264 --> 00:13:21.431
Hi! I missed you guys so much.

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:23.166
- And Diego!
- Uh, hi.

00:13:23.168 --> 00:13:24.903
Wow!

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:32.307
Wow! You're so skinny and tall!
Like a palmito tree.

00:13:32.309 --> 00:13:34.043
You don't even look like you.

00:13:34.045 --> 00:13:38.013
- Um... thank you?
- We're gonna have so much fun!

00:13:38.015 --> 00:13:42.084
You are way more energetic than I remember.

00:13:42.086 --> 00:13:43.455
Let's go!

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.930
- Ah, Dora.
- <i>¡Abuelita!</i>

00:13:57.635 --> 00:13:59.904
Oh, I missed you!

00:14:00.605 --> 00:14:03.239
Look at you! Such a big girl!

00:14:03.241 --> 00:14:05.041
And still with the bangs.

00:14:09.914 --> 00:14:12.281
Wow!

00:14:12.283 --> 00:14:13.483
It's so pink.

00:14:13.485 --> 00:14:15.518
And everything matches.

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.088
Yeah, my parents
thought you'd like it.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:20.726
Hey, I brought you something.

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:25.261
What is that?

00:14:25.263 --> 00:14:29.401
The candy bar that we split before
you left the jungle. Remember?

00:14:31.169 --> 00:14:32.368
Where's yours?

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:33.802
Um...

00:14:33.804 --> 00:14:36.674
Well, I...
probably ate it.

00:14:37.342 --> 00:14:39.010
Like ten years ago.

00:14:39.744 --> 00:14:41.043
Oh.

00:14:41.045 --> 00:14:42.545
Sorry. I'm...

00:14:42.547 --> 00:14:44.614
I just thought
that we were gonna

00:14:44.616 --> 00:14:47.349
mush them back together again.

00:14:47.351 --> 00:14:48.587
It's cool.

00:14:51.289 --> 00:14:52.924
This is gonna be great!

00:14:53.424 --> 00:14:54.992
Okay. Well...

00:14:55.626 --> 00:14:57.462
you should get some sleep.

00:14:59.731 --> 00:15:01.129
Good night, <i>prima.</i>

00:15:01.131 --> 00:15:02.967
<i>Buenas noches, primo.</i>

00:15:04.135 --> 00:15:05.370
Okay.

00:15:11.909 --> 00:15:14.645
Mm? Mmm.

00:15:25.722 --> 00:15:31.563

I always sing.
Helps me remember what to bring.

00:15:50.146 --> 00:15:51.382
Wow!

00:15:52.884 --> 00:15:54.018
What?

00:15:54.619 --> 00:15:56.388
This is how we get to school?

00:15:57.355 --> 00:15:59.422
Hold on. Do you mind?

00:15:59.424 --> 00:16:01.724
Just take that off.

00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:03.628
Do a little of that.

00:16:04.861 --> 00:16:08.098
- Hm.
- Is this to fit in with the indigenous people?

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.331
- I just want you to have a good first day.
- Mm.

00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:12.268
And if I don't talk to you,
don't take it personal, okay?

00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:13.569
We're all just trying
to survive high school.

00:16:13.571 --> 00:16:14.840
It's a horrible nightmare.

00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.848
Just be yourself.

00:16:25.850 --> 00:16:28.085
I'm new here!
What's your name?

00:16:28.718 --> 00:16:30.152
Wow.

00:16:30.154 --> 00:16:31.321
Whoa!

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:33.522
Okay, young lady. Bag, table.

00:16:33.524 --> 00:16:36.027
<i>Hola, soy Dora.</i>
And this is Backpack.

00:16:36.394 --> 00:16:38.159
Yeah.

00:16:38.161 --> 00:16:41.599
- What is this?
- A flare. In case of emergency.

00:16:42.066 --> 00:16:43.101
Oh.

00:16:43.534 --> 00:16:44.600
It works!

00:16:44.602 --> 00:16:46.701
Oh, and what are these?

00:16:46.703 --> 00:16:48.771
Iodine pills to sanitize water.

00:16:48.773 --> 00:16:50.873
Personal generator.

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:52.742
Two-way radio.

00:16:52.744 --> 00:16:54.643
Five-day
emergency food supply kit.

00:16:54.645 --> 00:16:57.446
OneLink Shelter System
with DoubleNest Hammock.

00:16:57.448 --> 00:16:58.750
You know, for cliff sleeping.

00:17:01.052 --> 00:17:03.186
You can't bring any of this
in here.

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.619
Pick it up after school.

00:17:04.621 --> 00:17:06.222
What's going on?

00:17:06.224 --> 00:17:07.723
But I can bring my yo-yo?

00:17:07.725 --> 00:17:11.360
You realize that a yo-yo
is by far my deadliest weapon.

00:17:11.362 --> 00:17:12.528
Really?

00:17:14.431 --> 00:17:16.497
I'm sorry. We're late.
Dora, let's go.

00:17:16.499 --> 00:17:18.367
Come on, let's go!

00:17:18.369 --> 00:17:19.869
Cupcakes for charity!

00:17:19.871 --> 00:17:22.940
Save the rain forest!
Cupcakes for charity!

00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:27.642
- What happened to the rain forest?
- It's being destroyed.

00:17:27.644 --> 00:17:29.211
Oh, no! Which one?

00:17:29.213 --> 00:17:32.150
Daintree? Yasuni? El Yunque?
Hoh? Tongass? Kakum?

00:17:32.784 --> 00:17:34.483
Uh... all of them?

00:17:34.485 --> 00:17:36.785
Ranching and agriculture
are some of the greatest threats

00:17:36.787 --> 00:17:38.253
facing the Amazon today.

00:17:38.255 --> 00:17:39.921
But I believe
that with focused conservation

00:17:39.923 --> 00:17:41.624
and plant-based diets,

00:17:41.626 --> 00:17:43.462
we can help the rain forest
thrive again.

00:17:45.763 --> 00:17:47.397
Who are you?

00:17:47.399 --> 00:17:48.664
Why are you smart?

00:17:48.666 --> 00:17:50.733
And what are you doing
in my school?

00:17:50.735 --> 00:17:53.168
Dora.
Home-schooled by professors.

00:17:53.170 --> 00:17:56.640
Parents misjudged me as irresponsible
and lacking in socialization.

00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:58.840
Oh.

00:17:58.842 --> 00:18:01.343
Have a cupcake on the house.

00:18:01.345 --> 00:18:02.578
Thank you!

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.916
- Have a great day.
- You, too. Bye!

00:18:06.684 --> 00:18:09.351
- She seems nice.
- She's not.

00:18:09.353 --> 00:18:10.552
That's Sammy Moore.

00:18:10.554 --> 00:18:11.888
She's an honor roll student,

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:13.956
tri-varsity athlete
and class president.

00:18:13.958 --> 00:18:17.493
Oh, so she must be
very admired by her peers.

00:18:17.495 --> 00:18:20.029
What, her? No way.

00:18:20.031 --> 00:18:23.432
Everyone hates her. She's literally,
like, the worst person on Earth.

00:18:25.736 --> 00:18:28.039
Hi! I'm Dora! Cool shirt.

00:18:29.439 --> 00:18:30.842
Whoa!

00:18:32.109 --> 00:18:33.542
We're not there.

00:18:33.544 --> 00:18:37.545
Earth.
We're more like over... here.

00:18:37.547 --> 00:18:38.983
Want me to correct it?

00:18:39.382 --> 00:18:40.619
Ah.

00:18:41.785 --> 00:18:44.218
Ah.

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.387
There we go.

00:18:45.389 --> 00:18:47.488
You... into astronomy?

00:18:47.490 --> 00:18:49.324
Of course I am. Who isn't?

00:18:49.326 --> 00:18:51.126
- -What's that?
Is there a problem?

00:18:51.128 --> 00:18:52.895
That's the morning bell.
We're late now. Thank you.

00:18:52.897 --> 00:18:54.599
Oh, goodbye.
Here's a cupcake.

00:18:55.565 --> 00:18:57.099
- Thank you!
- That's Randy Warren.

00:18:57.101 --> 00:18:58.867
You don't want
to talk to him, either, okay?

00:18:58.869 --> 00:19:00.304
Why?

00:19:01.604 --> 00:19:03.007
That's why.

00:19:05.141 --> 00:19:08.577
Okay, let's see who did
the reading last night.

00:19:08.579 --> 00:19:10.946
Who is Moby Dick...

00:19:10.948 --> 00:19:14.885
and why is this story
still significant today?

00:19:17.155 --> 00:19:18.353
Oh.

00:19:18.355 --> 00:19:20.856
Thank God. Someone else.

00:19:20.858 --> 00:19:23.125
You're new, yes?

00:19:23.127 --> 00:19:24.894
Well, say hello.

00:19:24.896 --> 00:19:27.862
<i>Hola.</i> I'm Dora.
I'm Diego's cousin.

00:19:27.864 --> 00:19:29.898
And Moby Dick is a whale.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.766
The novel exemplifies
the Western writer's

00:19:31.768 --> 00:19:34.436
nostalgic appropriation of
colonized indigenous cultures,

00:19:34.438 --> 00:19:37.742
which explains its reified
status in American fiction today.

00:19:38.742 --> 00:19:40.709
Where did you transfer from,
Dora?

00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:43.446
The jungle.

00:19:43.448 --> 00:19:46.249
My parents are both professors.
I do a lot of reading.

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:47.882
Dork-a!

00:19:47.884 --> 00:19:49.318
Thank you, Dora.

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:51.957
It looks like we have
a new star in the class.

00:19:53.724 --> 00:19:55.791
Not sure
I made myself clear earlier.

00:19:55.793 --> 00:19:59.227
But if you're going to take a shot
at the queen, you better not miss.

00:19:59.229 --> 00:20:02.397
There is nothing more dangerous
than a wounded animal.

00:20:02.399 --> 00:20:05.834
A lot of things are more
dangerous than a wounded animal.

00:20:05.836 --> 00:20:09.773
- A healthy one, for a start.
- Stop! Just... stop.

00:20:11.708 --> 00:20:13.111
I'm watching you.

00:20:22.186 --> 00:20:24.954
Goodbye, everyone!
Great job today!

00:20:24.956 --> 00:20:26.621
We did it!
We finished school!

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:19.935
I love this song!

00:22:19.937 --> 00:22:21.236
You want to dance?

00:22:21.238 --> 00:22:23.906
Sorry, Dora,
I can't really dance.

00:22:23.908 --> 00:22:26.574
- Okay.
- But...

00:22:26.576 --> 00:22:29.313
I can hold my breath
for seven minutes, though.

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.849
My parents left me unsupervised
at the community pool a lot.

00:22:33.851 --> 00:22:36.551
Pretending to drown
is a good way to get attention.

At least I got people
dancing and clapping.

00:23:41.851 --> 00:23:43.186
They were mocking you.

00:23:43.188 --> 00:23:44.852
They were laughing
at you and me!

00:23:44.854 --> 00:23:46.955
You've been here for weeks.
How do you not see that?

00:23:46.957 --> 00:23:49.657
I see it. I'm not stupid.

00:23:49.659 --> 00:23:52.628
But I have to be myself.
That's all I know how to do.

00:23:52.630 --> 00:23:54.196
Well, just stop doing it.

00:23:54.198 --> 00:23:55.763
For, like, one day
just stop being you

00:23:55.765 --> 00:23:57.532
and just be normal.

00:23:57.534 --> 00:24:00.601
Diego, we used to be so close.
Why are things so different now?

00:24:00.603 --> 00:24:02.405
Because, Dora,
this isn't the jungle,

00:24:02.407 --> 00:24:03.973
where you can
just do whatever you want

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:05.374
and be best friends
with a monkey.

00:24:05.376 --> 00:24:08.176
This is high school.
It's life or death.

00:24:08.178 --> 00:24:11.549
And it was hard enough already without
having to take care of the class weirdo.

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:23.995
Dora?

00:24:26.296 --> 00:24:27.398
Dora?

00:24:37.507 --> 00:24:38.610
Okay.

00:24:44.515 --> 00:24:48.553
Sometimes
we all need to hide. No?

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:56.425
I guess...
I never felt lonely

00:24:56.427 --> 00:24:59.030
when I was by myself
in the jungle.

00:25:00.197 --> 00:25:03.799
But now that
I'm surrounded by kids,

00:25:03.801 --> 00:25:06.033
I feel alone all the time.

00:25:14.111 --> 00:25:17.946
- I think Diego hates me.
- Ah.

00:25:17.948 --> 00:25:19.248
No.

00:25:20.082 --> 00:25:23.388
You are <i>familia, mi amor.</i>
Huh?

00:25:26.857 --> 00:25:28.559
- <i>Abuelita.</i>
- Hm?

00:25:30.428 --> 00:25:32.330
Am I a weirdo?

00:25:32.896 --> 00:25:34.532
Mm...

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.502
no more than the rest of us.

00:25:40.003 --> 00:25:41.570
That's not a "no."

00:25:41.572 --> 00:25:45.073
Let's get you
some <i>frijolitos,</i> okay?

00:25:48.345 --> 00:25:50.646
<i>Okay, here's
the scavenger hunt list.</i>

00:25:50.648 --> 00:25:52.147
You know the drill.

00:25:52.149 --> 00:25:55.417
Team up in groups of four
and go get some photos.

00:25:55.419 --> 00:25:58.286
Oh, and if anybody needs me,
I'll be in the cafeteria...

00:25:58.288 --> 00:26:00.388
questioning my life choices.

00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:03.292
- Can I be on your team?
- Do you guys need a fourth person?

00:26:03.294 --> 00:26:04.829
Hey, guys, us four?

00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:07.295
Can I be on your team?

00:26:07.297 --> 00:26:08.664
- Hey, guys.
- Can I be on your team?

00:26:09.432 --> 00:26:11.632
You've got to be kidding me.

00:26:11.634 --> 00:26:12.900
Hm.

00:26:12.902 --> 00:26:14.503
Of course this is happening.

00:26:14.505 --> 00:26:18.572
There's something really icy
happening between you two.

00:26:18.574 --> 00:26:21.642
- Was it the Disco Dork-a dance?
- Well, I'm glad you brought it up...

00:26:21.644 --> 00:26:23.378
I'm just kidding,
I don't actually care.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.615
Okay. "Find something that's
more than 1,000 years old.

00:26:26.617 --> 00:26:29.618
Oldest relic gets two
extra points." Come on!

00:26:29.620 --> 00:26:32.388
Oh, my gosh.
Could you be any bossier?

00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:35.390
- Excuse me? "Bossier." Really?
- Yeah.

00:26:35.392 --> 00:26:39.026
What's next? "Shrill?" Or am I
being too "difficult" for you?

00:26:39.028 --> 00:26:42.467
You left that out of your Misogyny 101 class.

00:26:44.067 --> 00:26:46.135
What?
Do you have something to say?

00:26:46.137 --> 00:26:48.438
I'm just so scared right now.

00:26:50.975 --> 00:26:52.907
What about
this Egyptian exhibit?

00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:56.244
Anything Egyptian would be
the oldest relic by far.

00:26:56.246 --> 00:26:58.112
- Guys?
- Psst.

00:26:58.114 --> 00:27:00.549
I think I may be able
to help you.

00:27:00.551 --> 00:27:02.517
Overheard
about your scavenger hunt.

00:27:02.519 --> 00:27:04.386
You were looking
at the Egyptian posters.

00:27:04.388 --> 00:27:06.955
- When does it open?
- Oh, that's the problem, two weeks.

00:27:06.957 --> 00:27:09.593
They're unloading it today in the basement.

00:27:11.562 --> 00:27:14.663
Look...
If it means that much to you,

00:27:14.665 --> 00:27:16.300
there may be
a way for you to get down there.

00:27:30.014 --> 00:27:32.348
This best not be
some wild goose chase.

00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:36.452
I sure hope it is.
I love chasing wild geese.

00:27:36.454 --> 00:27:39.286
Until you catch one.
Then it is not fun.

00:27:39.288 --> 00:27:41.725
A caught goose
is just the meanest!

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:56.838
Well, it's grouped by origin, so the Ancient
Egyptian stuff should be in this aisle.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:58.072
- Whoa.
- Oh.

00:27:58.074 --> 00:28:00.176
- Hi.
- Oh, no, she's been caught!

00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:02.211
And I can totally explain
why I'm here.

00:28:02.213 --> 00:28:03.811
- Someone's coming.
- Come with me, miss.

00:28:03.813 --> 00:28:05.113
Hide! Hide!

00:28:05.115 --> 00:28:06.215
- Where?
- There, there, there!

00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:10.819
Look what I found
sneaking around.

00:28:10.821 --> 00:28:13.754
Ah. An interloper.

00:28:13.756 --> 00:28:14.858
A thief.

00:28:15.492 --> 00:28:18.563
Or maybe an explorer.

00:28:19.796 --> 00:28:22.830
- <i>Hola, Dora.</i>
- Hi, I'm Dora, and...

00:28:22.832 --> 00:28:25.202
Wait, you already knew my name?

00:28:25.937 --> 00:28:28.206
Hey. You gotta help me.

00:28:29.171 --> 00:28:31.439
I guess we win
the scavenger hunt.

00:28:31.441 --> 00:28:33.675
What? Hey, no.

00:28:33.677 --> 00:28:35.178
Let me go!

00:28:36.179 --> 00:28:39.013
- Hey, no!
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:28:39.015 --> 00:28:41.349
- What's going on?
- Is this a scavenger hunt?

00:28:41.351 --> 00:28:43.051
What are you guys doing in here?

00:28:44.521 --> 00:28:47.388
Sleep tight, Dora,
and when you wake up,

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:51.428
you will help us find your
parents, and then... Parapata.

00:29:03.006 --> 00:29:04.441
What's happening?

00:29:05.642 --> 00:29:07.141
Where are we?

00:29:15.686 --> 00:29:18.521
I think... we're being unloaded
from a plane.

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.690
We're not on a plane.
We can't...

00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:26.195
Oh, my God, we're on a plane!
Oh...

00:29:26.197 --> 00:29:27.596
We've left the country
without ID.

00:29:27.598 --> 00:29:29.367
We need to alert
the US consulate.

00:29:39.342 --> 00:29:40.841
Dora, what happened?

00:29:46.115 --> 00:29:47.115
They're treasure hunters?

00:29:47.117 --> 00:29:48.282
Why did I take Mandarin?

00:29:48.284 --> 00:29:49.484
What are you guys saying?

00:29:52.555 --> 00:29:54.257
We gotta get out of here.

00:29:56.794 --> 00:29:59.729
Oh, look, Dora brought a knife
on the field trip, everybody.

00:30:03.734 --> 00:30:06.670
I see three mercenaries. Armed.

00:30:07.405 --> 00:30:08.673
Wait, there's a fourth.

00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:11.505
I think he saw me.

00:30:11.507 --> 00:30:13.574
- He's coming for us.
- Ah!

00:30:13.576 --> 00:30:18.248
- Okay. I am not here.
- I'm an avatar.

00:30:22.886 --> 00:30:24.753
Dora! It is you!

00:30:24.755 --> 00:30:27.622
- Who are you?
- I'm a friend of your parents.

00:30:27.624 --> 00:30:29.189
I'm rescuing you, Dora!

00:30:29.191 --> 00:30:31.092
Come with me
if you want to live...

00:30:32.162 --> 00:30:33.227
Where did he go?

00:30:33.229 --> 00:30:34.997
Did... Did he die?

00:30:35.966 --> 00:30:38.667
I'm okay! I'm okay.
I need your help.

00:30:38.669 --> 00:30:41.272
But we have to run. Now!

00:30:45.007 --> 00:30:46.374
Boss!

00:30:46.376 --> 00:30:48.310
Get them!

00:30:48.312 --> 00:30:51.411
My parents did not sign
a permission slip for the jungle!

00:30:51.413 --> 00:30:53.282
Why are we here?

00:30:53.284 --> 00:30:55.283
Where's the museum?
Why, why, why?

00:30:55.285 --> 00:30:58.353
- How do we get out of here?
- I don't know!

00:30:58.355 --> 00:31:01.725
- Getting you out of the box was as far as my plan went.
- Huh?

00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.530
Huh!
Swiper at the ready!

00:31:08.532 --> 00:31:11.034
Whatever happens,
get that map.

00:31:11.601 --> 00:31:13.702
Swiper, yes, swiping.

00:31:13.704 --> 00:31:15.404
What kind of rescue is this?

00:31:15.406 --> 00:31:17.138
It's the only one you've got.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:18.542
Here. Let me try.

00:31:19.243 --> 00:31:20.778
- <i>Hola.</i>
- What the...

00:31:22.412 --> 00:31:24.612
Hey!
That fox just swiped my map!

00:31:24.614 --> 00:31:26.648
Where is it?
Where is it? Where is it?

00:31:26.650 --> 00:31:29.553
What part of, "The fox just swiped my map"
don't you understand? Come on, help me!

00:31:31.488 --> 00:31:33.589
Gotcha!
There you are, my little friend.

00:31:33.591 --> 00:31:36.427
No swiping, you...
you... swiper!

00:31:41.598 --> 00:31:45.466
Yeah, oh!
Oh!

00:31:45.468 --> 00:31:46.703
Ohh!

00:31:51.441 --> 00:31:52.507
She's amazing.

00:31:52.509 --> 00:31:53.776
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Uh-oh!

00:31:55.312 --> 00:31:56.781
Oh, shoot!

00:31:59.282 --> 00:32:02.787
Man! I'm stuck upside-down.

00:32:06.556 --> 00:32:08.457
Swiper, no...

00:32:09.292 --> 00:32:11.894
- Good job, Swiper.
- I know, man.

00:32:11.896 --> 00:32:13.030
Get her!

00:32:15.099 --> 00:32:16.367
Dora!

00:32:18.168 --> 00:32:20.003
- Now what do we do?
- Come on, come on!

00:32:20.937 --> 00:32:23.407
- Where did our rescuer go?
- He ran away!

00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.808
- Get in!
- Open this door, man!

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:28.746
- Get in!
- I'm not joking, man!

00:32:30.479 --> 00:32:32.982
Viper, get the truck!
Don't let them escape!

00:32:34.651 --> 00:32:36.417
- Hold on!
- Ohh!

00:32:46.330 --> 00:32:47.564
Sorry!

00:32:54.204 --> 00:32:55.639
Are they following?

00:32:59.676 --> 00:33:01.275
Where have they gone?

00:33:01.277 --> 00:33:04.678
This is the only road for miles.
Keep your eyes peeled.

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:06.484
Not anymore.

00:33:07.650 --> 00:33:09.818
Are you kids okay?

00:33:12.890 --> 00:33:14.255
Oh.

00:33:14.257 --> 00:33:16.457
- Not really.
- "Not really"?

00:33:16.459 --> 00:33:17.993
Understatement of the century.

00:33:17.995 --> 00:33:20.594
I was just kidnapped
and chased by bad guys!

00:33:20.596 --> 00:33:23.731
And a fox with a mask!
Everyone saw that, right?

00:33:23.733 --> 00:33:25.867
Like, why does that fox
need to remain anonymous?

00:33:25.869 --> 00:33:28.836
Who is gonna recognize
one specific fox?

00:33:28.838 --> 00:33:30.839
- Mm.
- How did you know my name?

00:33:30.841 --> 00:33:32.907
You were an infant
the last time I saw you.

00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:35.976
My name is Alejandro Gutierrez.
I'm a professor of ancient languages

00:33:35.978 --> 00:33:38.178
at San Marcos University
in Lima, Peru.

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:42.583
Your parents and I were in constant
contact during their time here.

00:33:42.585 --> 00:33:46.288
Then two weeks ago,
your parents' calls stopped.

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:48.890
Since then... <i>silencio.</i>

00:33:48.892 --> 00:33:51.359
- That means silence.
- Yeah. I got that one.

00:33:51.361 --> 00:33:54.029
They haven't answered any of my
sat phone call for weeks, either.

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:57.298
Your father sent me this just a
week before, in case I could help.

00:33:57.300 --> 00:33:58.867
Ah, Papi's journal!

00:33:58.869 --> 00:34:00.568
So I came here
to make sure they were okay.

00:34:00.570 --> 00:34:02.137
Tracked them this far.

00:34:02.139 --> 00:34:04.939
I've been staking it out,
hoping for a sign from them.

00:34:04.941 --> 00:34:10.845
And then I saw you poke your head out of
that crate and I said to myself, "Dora!"

00:34:10.847 --> 00:34:13.314
Dora the...
kidnapped teenager!

00:34:13.316 --> 00:34:15.950
But how did you recognize me?

00:34:15.952 --> 00:34:18.486
Well, you look
sort of exactly the same.

00:34:18.488 --> 00:34:22.856
But... I'm afraid I have no idea
where to find your parents.

00:34:22.858 --> 00:34:25.392
Don't worry. I can track
my parents in the jungle.

00:34:25.394 --> 00:34:26.561
Let's go!

00:34:26.563 --> 00:34:27.829
Hold up.

00:34:27.831 --> 00:34:29.497
Or we could call
the local police

00:34:29.499 --> 00:34:32.033
and have them come rescue us
with, like, a SWAT team.

00:34:32.035 --> 00:34:34.602
Hmm. Yeah, that sounds like
another solid option.

00:34:34.604 --> 00:34:36.137
Of course!

00:34:36.139 --> 00:34:38.872
Hello? 911?
Can you please come and get us?

00:34:38.874 --> 00:34:42.010
We're at the corner
of Rain and Forest.

00:34:42.012 --> 00:34:45.280
Okay, I get it!
I just want to go home.

00:34:45.282 --> 00:34:47.485
We're gonna die out here.

00:34:48.017 --> 00:34:49.216
Look around you.

00:34:49.218 --> 00:34:52.720
This is the kind of place
where people die.

00:34:52.722 --> 00:34:56.457
I mean, in a way, every place is
the kind of place where people die.

00:34:56.459 --> 00:34:59.327
- Okay, well, that's a bummer notion.
- Guys, guys.

00:34:59.329 --> 00:35:03.398
Listen, finding Dora's parents is
our best chance of getting home.

00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.367
My aunt and uncle
will know what to do.

00:35:05.369 --> 00:35:08.202
Dora's my cousin, I can't
just let her go off with some...

00:35:08.204 --> 00:35:10.637
strange and anxious man
we just met.

00:35:10.639 --> 00:35:11.907
Thank you, Diego.

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:14.209
Now let's go
find Dora's parents.

00:35:29.325 --> 00:35:31.695
Look! In there!
That's their car!

00:35:41.171 --> 00:35:44.271
Here. This is it.
Our family symbol.

00:35:44.273 --> 00:35:47.209
- This is where they started hiking.
- Are we there?

00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:49.943
Where are your parents?
I don't see your parents.

00:35:49.945 --> 00:35:52.180
We can't go any further by car.

00:35:52.182 --> 00:35:54.649
- The jungle gets too dense.
- So how do we...

00:35:54.651 --> 00:35:57.885
We must enter the jungle
on foot.

00:35:57.887 --> 00:36:00.990
Luckily, I prepared
for this possibility.

00:36:02.758 --> 00:36:06.693
Okay, I may have gone
a little overboard on supplies.

00:36:06.695 --> 00:36:07.931
Be my guest.

00:36:11.901 --> 00:36:14.704
This is a legit nightmare!

00:36:19.575 --> 00:36:21.642
I'm not going in first, though.

00:36:21.644 --> 00:36:24.081
You go first, Dora.
It feels right.

00:36:25.249 --> 00:36:27.881
You all
have nothing to worry about.

00:36:27.883 --> 00:36:30.218
The jungle is perfectly safe!

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:33.857
Just don't touch anything.
Or breathe too deeply.

00:36:38.028 --> 00:36:39.063
Oh.

00:36:47.169 --> 00:36:49.606
Are you sure
your parents went this way?

00:36:51.675 --> 00:36:53.142
Okay, what are these?

00:36:53.843 --> 00:36:55.144
Warning signs.

00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:57.479
Totems.

00:36:57.481 --> 00:36:59.847
Legend tells
of a deadly ancient militia

00:36:59.849 --> 00:37:02.983
dedicated to protecting Parapata
from outside eyes.

00:37:02.985 --> 00:37:05.419
No one has seen
<i>Los Guardianes Perdidos...</i>

00:37:05.421 --> 00:37:08.289
The Lost Guardians,
for centuries.

00:37:15.365 --> 00:37:16.731
What was that?

00:37:16.733 --> 00:37:18.466
Quechua.

00:37:18.468 --> 00:37:20.968
Ancient Inca. Impressive.

00:37:20.970 --> 00:37:22.805
What does it mean?

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:26.176
"All those that seek Parapata...

00:37:27.077 --> 00:37:28.742
shall surely perish."

00:37:28.744 --> 00:37:31.879
Okay, I am ready for my parents
to come and get me now.

00:37:31.881 --> 00:37:33.680
You have nothing to worry about.

00:37:33.682 --> 00:37:37.286
I promise. I mean,
there's no need to overreact.

00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:43.327
Get it off! Get it off!
Get it off!

00:37:49.398 --> 00:37:54.771
And that was just an example
of the dangers of overreacting.

00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:19.827
You okay?

00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:21.197
Fine. Totally fine.

00:38:22.898 --> 00:38:25.935
Hey. I found one of
those red loops.

00:38:26.836 --> 00:38:28.702
My parents' symbol.

00:38:28.704 --> 00:38:32.274
- We must be getting close.
- Oh, thank you, thank you!

00:38:32.276 --> 00:38:34.078
We're going home.

00:38:41.918 --> 00:38:43.553
This is my parents' camp.

00:38:44.486 --> 00:38:47.789
Or was.
I mean, this is their stuff.

00:38:50.093 --> 00:38:51.758
Someone's watching.

00:38:53.095 --> 00:38:54.731
I can feel it.

00:39:00.602 --> 00:39:02.769
Aha!

00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:04.472
Kill it! Quickly, kill it!

00:39:04.474 --> 00:39:05.939
Boots! Oh!

00:39:05.941 --> 00:39:08.843
Oh, Boots,
I'm so happy to see you!

00:39:08.845 --> 00:39:10.711
She knows this monkey?

00:39:10.713 --> 00:39:12.479
Of course she knows this monkey.

00:39:13.950 --> 00:39:16.651
Thank goodness.

00:39:16.653 --> 00:39:18.519
He saw them.

00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:22.490
Oh, sorry. This is Boots.
Boots, these are my friends.

00:39:22.492 --> 00:39:24.158
They're here to help me.

00:39:24.160 --> 00:39:26.794
No. We're here to get saved.

00:39:26.796 --> 00:39:28.963
Oh, and FYI,
we are not friends.

00:39:35.939 --> 00:39:37.370
They did this quickly.

00:39:37.372 --> 00:39:39.340
- See how they rushed it?
- Yeah.

00:39:39.342 --> 00:39:43.678
Still, I can track my parents
better than any mercenaries.

00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.116
We just have to
get to them first.

00:39:51.488 --> 00:39:54.955
Uh, may we stop for a moment?
I need to do a thing.

00:39:54.957 --> 00:39:56.957
- What?
- Just a thing.

00:39:56.959 --> 00:39:58.128
What thing?

00:39:58.861 --> 00:40:00.597
I know what this is.

00:40:01.564 --> 00:40:05.635
- You have to poo.
- No. That isn't it.

00:40:06.702 --> 00:40:09.403
Of course I have to poo!
I haven't pooed in 48 hours!

00:40:09.405 --> 00:40:12.073
I'm sweating,
and every step is agony!

00:40:12.075 --> 00:40:14.242
Well, don't look at me
cover your ears!

00:40:14.244 --> 00:40:15.542
Probably should've said
"cover your ears"

00:40:15.544 --> 00:40:18.012
before you said "poo"
like, 47 times.

00:40:18.014 --> 00:40:20.483
There's no need to be afraid.

00:40:21.117 --> 00:40:22.318
I have an idea.

00:40:23.218 --> 00:40:26.120
- Let's turn this into a song.
- Let's not.

00:40:26.122 --> 00:40:28.122
You know what?
I think it's passed.

00:40:28.124 --> 00:40:31.160
Why don't we just go back
to the group, and we can just...

00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:37.832
Seriously? You had that
in your backpack, too?

00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:39.600
A poo shovel.

00:40:39.602 --> 00:40:43.303
<i>♪ It's time to dig

00:40:43.305 --> 00:40:44.905

00:40:44.907 --> 00:40:48.608

00:41:02.425 --> 00:41:06.026
I believe in you, Sammy.
I believe that you can do this.

00:41:06.028 --> 00:41:08.997
Also, medically,
you have to do this.

00:41:08.999 --> 00:41:11.899
Okay, bye! Come on, Boots.

00:41:11.901 --> 00:41:14.071
Ah.

00:41:15.872 --> 00:41:17.271
She's good.

00:41:17.273 --> 00:41:19.606
There's nothing to be afraid of.

00:41:21.244 --> 00:41:23.077
Not good. Not good at all.

00:41:23.079 --> 00:41:25.213
Go, go, go!

00:41:27.416 --> 00:41:31.454
Real arrows flying at us!
Real arrows flying at us!

00:41:35.858 --> 00:41:37.791

00:41:37.793 --> 00:41:39.160

00:41:39.162 --> 00:41:41.930
Ah!

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:43.430
- Run!
- Look away! Look away!

00:41:43.432 --> 00:41:44.966
- Sorry, no time!
- We saw nothing!

00:41:44.968 --> 00:41:47.434
- Run for your life!
- We gotta go!

00:41:47.436 --> 00:41:48.470
Ahh!

00:41:49.405 --> 00:41:51.405
- What is happening?
- It's the curse!

00:41:51.407 --> 00:41:54.675
The curse is gonna perish us.
We're gonna perish all over the place!

00:41:54.677 --> 00:41:56.246
There, there! Follow me!

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.982
This way!

00:42:07.590 --> 00:42:10.158
I'm hit! They hit me!
I'm bleeding out!

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.628
I am losing life force!

00:42:12.928 --> 00:42:16.129
Oh, no, no, no! No, it's a juice box.
It's just a juice box.

00:42:23.171 --> 00:42:25.943
I think we're safe. For now.

00:42:33.282 --> 00:42:36.716
Not safe. Not safe! Not safe!

00:42:40.689 --> 00:42:43.189
I want to go home!
I want to go home!

00:42:58.173 --> 00:43:00.643
I'm okay! I'm okay!

00:43:02.878 --> 00:43:04.246
Guys...

00:43:04.981 --> 00:43:07.113
I can't say for sure...

00:43:07.115 --> 00:43:13.320
because I'm fairly confident I just
sustained a... serious brain injury,

00:43:13.322 --> 00:43:15.455
but I do believe...

00:43:15.457 --> 00:43:19.126
we may have just met
<i>Los Guardianes Perdidos.</i>

00:43:19.128 --> 00:43:20.628
The Lost Guardians.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:22.796
I thought you said
they were just legends.

00:43:22.798 --> 00:43:25.999
These are the same Inca sun
symbols that were on those totems.

00:43:26.001 --> 00:43:28.334
So these are like,
legit arrows?

00:43:28.336 --> 00:43:30.470
Like, kill-people arrows?

00:43:30.472 --> 00:43:33.309
The markings
are quite authentic.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:36.780
Hey, you okay?

00:43:37.881 --> 00:43:39.116
"Okay?"

00:43:39.615 --> 00:43:40.747
Okay?

00:43:40.749 --> 00:43:42.584
No, I'm not okay, okay?

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:43.983
I want to go home!

00:43:43.985 --> 00:43:46.352
I want to be staring at my
phone, in an ice-cold room,

00:43:46.354 --> 00:43:48.455
drinking
a frozen coffee beverage!

00:43:48.457 --> 00:43:52.026
And I know that makes me sound real
basic, but that is what I want!

00:43:52.028 --> 00:43:53.894
Oh, and by the way,
the poo song lied.

00:43:53.896 --> 00:43:56.896
Yeah, it was totally dangerous,
arrows rained down on me.

00:43:56.898 --> 00:43:58.734
I hate it here!

00:43:59.769 --> 00:44:01.535
Uh! Uh!

00:44:01.537 --> 00:44:04.241
And I can't even storm off
'cause this jungle will eat me!

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:06.909
Maybe a song will help.

00:44:08.043 --> 00:44:10.410
<i>♪ It's okay
To freak out sometimes ♪</i>

00:44:10.412 --> 00:44:11.678
<i>♪ It's really okay... ♪</i>

00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:14.251
No more songs!

00:44:22.724 --> 00:44:23.759
Okay.

00:44:46.615 --> 00:44:48.717
Are you here
to yell at me, too?

00:44:49.686 --> 00:44:53.590
Nah. Actually, I'm here
to avoid getting yelled at.

00:44:57.494 --> 00:45:00.664
It's scary to be responsible
for other people.

00:45:01.697 --> 00:45:03.799
It's easier when you're alone.

00:45:05.901 --> 00:45:07.303
Is it?

00:45:15.977 --> 00:45:20.448
Look, I know she can be like,
a real pain in the butt sometimes, but...

00:45:21.117 --> 00:45:24.220
she's not all bad, I guess.

00:45:33.095 --> 00:45:34.961
You have an attraction for her.

00:45:34.963 --> 00:45:37.263
What? No.

00:45:37.265 --> 00:45:39.133
No, I definitely
never said that.

00:45:39.135 --> 00:45:41.135
You know,
a life-threatening situation

00:45:41.137 --> 00:45:44.071
can often accelerate the
mating process in many species!

00:45:44.073 --> 00:45:47.608
Okay, no.
Just slow your roll.

00:45:47.610 --> 00:45:50.579
And please don't ever
say the word "mating" again.

00:45:51.313 --> 00:45:54.316
- Ever.
- Mm. Mm-hmm.

00:45:54.985 --> 00:45:56.785
Let's just get out of here.

00:45:57.952 --> 00:46:00.322
Are we even going the right way?

00:46:11.233 --> 00:46:12.468
What?

00:46:13.302 --> 00:46:14.803
Fox tracks.

00:46:27.349 --> 00:46:31.184
I scouted the area.
There's a freshly-cut path to the north,

00:46:31.186 --> 00:46:32.720
some ruins to the east.

00:46:32.722 --> 00:46:34.787
- Did you find any more of their markings?
- No.

00:46:34.789 --> 00:46:37.992
- Okay, then we head north.
- That's the path they took.

00:46:37.994 --> 00:46:39.894
- Hi, guys!
- Shh!

00:46:39.896 --> 00:46:41.331
What was that?

00:46:46.269 --> 00:46:47.770
Oh. Ah.

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:51.972
Ah-oh!

00:46:59.648 --> 00:47:01.314
What, you're scared
of monkeys now?

00:47:01.316 --> 00:47:03.617
Monkeys can carry
three times their body weight.

00:47:03.619 --> 00:47:06.153
So that's a yes?
Viper's scared of monkeys.

00:47:06.155 --> 00:47:08.155
It's just a monkey fact.

00:47:08.157 --> 00:47:09.392
That's all it is.

00:47:14.729 --> 00:47:17.265
Where are those guys?

00:47:17.267 --> 00:47:20.069
They're definitely dead.
It's just you and me now.

00:47:21.037 --> 00:47:23.504
Of course...
we'll have to start a family.

00:47:23.506 --> 00:47:25.071
We are not starting a family.

00:47:25.073 --> 00:47:27.309
Eh, give it a few days.

00:47:28.477 --> 00:47:31.211
Uh! Hey!
Where have you guys been?

00:47:31.213 --> 00:47:34.247
- Hi, guys.
- Look, I'm really sorry, Dora.

00:47:34.249 --> 00:47:36.149
It's fine.
It's fine, Sammy.

00:47:36.151 --> 00:47:39.153
We saw the mercenaries.
They're ahead of us.

00:47:39.155 --> 00:47:41.321
We'll have to follow the
mercenaries from a safe distance.

00:47:41.323 --> 00:47:45.093
No. We're not following them.
My parents didn't go that way.

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:48.829
My father says that the way to
Parapata passes through an opera house.

00:47:48.831 --> 00:47:50.430
The opera house was built
hundreds of years ago

00:47:50.432 --> 00:47:51.798
by Europeans
during the rubber boom.

00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:53.602
There'll be nothing
but ruins by now.

00:47:54.236 --> 00:47:55.805
This is the way they went.

00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.576
This must be it.

00:48:01.443 --> 00:48:03.679
Or was it.

00:48:06.448 --> 00:48:09.515
It doesn't look like any opera
singers have been here for a while.

00:48:09.517 --> 00:48:11.486
Yeah.

00:48:11.488 --> 00:48:14.187
The Europeans
may have built it, but...

00:48:14.189 --> 00:48:16.090
the jungle has taken it back.

00:48:24.633 --> 00:48:27.200
Ew, my feet.

00:48:27.202 --> 00:48:28.769
Why does the ground
feel like chocolate pudding?

00:48:28.771 --> 00:48:30.570
Excuse me.

00:48:30.572 --> 00:48:33.341
Wait, wait, wait!

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:35.776
I ate a lot of <i>frijoles</i>
and <i>chimichangas.</i>

00:48:38.713 --> 00:48:41.816
I ate <i>chile con carne.</i>

00:48:43.852 --> 00:48:46.387
I ate <i>mucho pozole.</i>

00:48:46.389 --> 00:48:49.189
Um...

00:48:49.191 --> 00:48:53.630
Wait. Anyone else notice
the walls are getting higher?

00:48:54.796 --> 00:48:56.865
Quicksand!

00:49:00.068 --> 00:49:01.501
You got to be kidding me!

00:49:01.503 --> 00:49:02.936
Quicksand really exists?

00:49:02.938 --> 00:49:05.671
I thought it was just
a video game thing.

00:49:05.673 --> 00:49:07.075
Like <i>Pitfall!</i>

00:49:07.610 --> 00:49:08.876
It's a classic.

00:49:08.878 --> 00:49:10.611
How do we get out
of this stuff?

00:49:10.613 --> 00:49:13.512
Okay, rule number one
of quicksand: don't panic.

00:49:13.514 --> 00:49:15.383
You'll only
get sucked in further.

00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:17.686
Lie down flat on your back.

00:49:18.454 --> 00:49:20.586
You have to
distribute your weight.

00:49:20.588 --> 00:49:22.057
Okay. All right.

00:49:24.193 --> 00:49:26.861
No, no, no.
I'm not doing that.

00:49:26.863 --> 00:49:28.794
Yeah.
No, this feels super wrong.

00:49:28.796 --> 00:49:31.030
Now make little
movements with your legs

00:49:31.032 --> 00:49:33.633
to make space for the water
to get between the sand.

00:49:33.635 --> 00:49:37.704
And once your legs are free,
simply backstroke out of the quicksand.

00:49:37.706 --> 00:49:40.274
Oh, give me a break.
We're gonna die in here.

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:47.015
Look, look! It's working!
It's working!

00:49:54.055 --> 00:49:55.090
Come on.

00:50:02.331 --> 00:50:04.064
Thanks.

00:50:04.066 --> 00:50:07.468
- Help me!
- Alejandro, you have to stop moving.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:08.571
Stay sti...

00:50:10.572 --> 00:50:12.674
Why have you all gone quiet?

00:50:13.209 --> 00:50:14.541
It's bad, isn't it?

00:50:17.713 --> 00:50:19.615
Oh, no! Shoo!

00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:26.454
Cha!
No, no no! Not on the face.

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:28.955
Not on the face. Ahh!

00:50:28.957 --> 00:50:31.559
It's another male.
They will now fight.

00:50:31.561 --> 00:50:33.260
No, no!

00:50:33.262 --> 00:50:35.664
Ahh!

00:50:36.733 --> 00:50:38.698
I'm not sure
those guys are fighting.

00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.202
Oh, it's a female.

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:43.870
They are not fighting.
They are mating!

00:50:45.807 --> 00:50:48.374
- Get it off!
- Quick, someone go get a branch.

00:50:48.376 --> 00:50:51.447
- I'm sinking!
- No, no, wait!

00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.080
Guys, come back!

00:50:54.082 --> 00:50:56.350
It's a jungle full of
trees and I can't find a branch.

00:50:56.352 --> 00:50:57.584
Oh, oh, no!

00:50:57.586 --> 00:51:00.555
Alejandro! Alejandro!

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:02.957
I see feet. Human feet!

00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:04.126
Over here!

00:51:05.193 --> 00:51:10.532
Okay, everyone.
One, two, three! Ahh!

00:51:24.881 --> 00:51:26.812
- I'm alive?
- Yes!

00:51:26.814 --> 00:51:30.117
- I'm alive! I'm alive!
- Yes!

00:51:30.119 --> 00:51:33.956
- I'm alive! I'm alive!
- Yes!

00:51:34.689 --> 00:51:38.827
I'm alive, I'm alive...

00:51:41.229 --> 00:51:43.632
I thought I was gonna die.

00:51:44.633 --> 00:51:47.537
I thought I was gonna die.

00:51:49.671 --> 00:51:52.205
It's so awkward
when adults cry.

00:51:52.207 --> 00:51:54.642
You just don't know
where to look.

00:51:54.644 --> 00:51:56.746
And I was stupid!

00:51:57.780 --> 00:52:00.283
And then a scorpion went...

00:52:01.249 --> 00:52:03.753
mating on my head.

00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:09.823
I'm so sorry.

00:52:09.825 --> 00:52:11.794
My whole life is a lie.

00:52:12.628 --> 00:52:13.794
I'm a fraud.

00:52:13.796 --> 00:52:15.765
- No! No.
- Yes.

00:52:16.698 --> 00:52:19.133
Everyone thinks that sometimes,
Alejandro.

00:52:19.135 --> 00:52:20.399
I'm a bad guy.

00:52:20.401 --> 00:52:21.836
- No.
- Yes.

00:52:21.838 --> 00:52:24.671
- No. No. No.
- No, yes, I am. Yes.

00:52:24.673 --> 00:52:28.374
I'm a... I'm a bad guy!

00:52:28.376 --> 00:52:33.148
No, you are not a bad guy.
No one is, deep down inside.

00:52:34.717 --> 00:52:37.287
- Thank you, Dora.
- Come on.

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:40.255
Where are we?

00:52:41.356 --> 00:52:42.592
Someone lives here.

00:52:44.559 --> 00:52:46.262
And that someone's coming.

00:53:02.677 --> 00:53:05.144
She hasn't seen my parents.

00:53:05.146 --> 00:53:09.149
And she doesn't seem very
interested in helping me find them.

00:53:09.151 --> 00:53:11.484
Perhaps she knows
how to get to Parapata.

00:53:11.486 --> 00:53:12.854
Parapata!

00:53:14.856 --> 00:53:16.323
She seemed
pretty interested in that.

00:53:24.832 --> 00:53:27.269
Are they supposed to be us?

00:53:36.378 --> 00:53:37.780
Yah!

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:44.917
That seemed bad, right?

00:53:44.919 --> 00:53:47.019
- Everyone thinks that was bad?
- Yeah, a little bit.

00:54:04.974 --> 00:54:07.106
What? What did she say?

00:54:07.108 --> 00:54:10.876
She said anyone
seeking Parapata is cursed.

00:54:10.878 --> 00:54:12.879
Well, that's great.

00:54:12.881 --> 00:54:16.350
But she also said she knows how
to get you guys back downriver.

00:54:16.352 --> 00:54:18.417
She can take you home.

00:54:18.419 --> 00:54:19.686
All of you.

00:54:19.688 --> 00:54:22.523
Yes. Yes! I am saved!

00:54:22.525 --> 00:54:24.957
I... mean,

00:54:24.959 --> 00:54:27.994
only if you are cool
without us, obviously.

00:54:27.996 --> 00:54:31.465
You got me into this mess,
but I guess you're getting me out of it,

00:54:31.467 --> 00:54:33.669
so we'll call it even.

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:39.205
I'm coming with you.
I can't let you go alone.

00:54:39.207 --> 00:54:42.244
I mean, plus you're my cousin.
There's, like, rules about that.

00:54:48.717 --> 00:54:50.419
This is where we split up.

00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.163
Oh, my...

00:55:03.932 --> 00:55:07.904
I... I hope you don't die
or anything.

00:55:09.171 --> 00:55:10.273
You, too.

00:55:19.881 --> 00:55:21.183
Is she staring at us?

00:55:21.849 --> 00:55:23.418
- Yeah.
- Okay, time to go.

00:55:26.188 --> 00:55:27.787
Diego, Dora, let's go.

00:55:31.427 --> 00:55:33.327
- Hm?
- She says stick to the path.

00:55:33.329 --> 00:55:36.332
Oh. Let's go.
Bye, guys.

00:55:36.932 --> 00:55:38.501
Good luck, Dora.

00:55:47.108 --> 00:55:50.278
- -Why is she in
such a hurry to get us out of here?

00:55:56.818 --> 00:55:58.153
Randy, wait, stop.

00:55:58.686 --> 00:56:00.421
Oh, no. Oh, no!

00:56:00.423 --> 00:56:02.888
No, no, no, come on!
We've got to warn them!

00:56:15.202 --> 00:56:17.972
Not something you see every day.

00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:20.541
Are you sure about this?

00:56:20.543 --> 00:56:24.046
Well, she said this
was the way we had to go.

00:56:25.814 --> 00:56:29.385
Don't touch anything.

00:57:05.387 --> 00:57:07.954
Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:57:07.956 --> 00:57:09.291
We did it!

00:57:11.593 --> 00:57:13.095
Oops.

00:57:23.439 --> 00:57:25.004
It spat in my face!

00:57:26.474 --> 00:57:28.675
- We're in a spore field!
- Don't breathe it in!

00:57:28.677 --> 00:57:30.977
- Let's get out of here!
- It's okay. It's okay.

00:57:30.979 --> 00:57:33.412
If these were poisonous spores,
we'd all be dead by now.

00:57:33.414 --> 00:57:36.518
Come on, Diego...
Oh, whoa.

00:57:37.686 --> 00:57:38.921
What?

00:57:39.688 --> 00:57:42.525
- What?
- Oh, boy.

00:57:45.093 --> 00:57:46.961
What's happening?

00:57:46.963 --> 00:57:48.461
- You... You look weird.
- You look weird.

00:57:48.463 --> 00:57:50.296
- No, you look weird.
- You... No, you.

00:57:50.298 --> 00:57:52.832
- No, you! You!
- You! You! Him!

00:57:56.939 --> 00:57:59.106
I don't need these clothes
anymore!

00:57:59.108 --> 00:58:01.374
Oh!

00:58:01.376 --> 00:58:02.975
Blech!

00:58:02.977 --> 00:58:05.245
I'm sure this will pass.
It's fine!

00:58:05.247 --> 00:58:06.946
Fine? Are you kidding me?

00:58:06.948 --> 00:58:09.251
This is incredible!

00:58:10.751 --> 00:58:12.151
Hi, Dora!

00:58:12.153 --> 00:58:14.687
Hi there, Map!
Oh, I thought I lost you.

00:58:14.689 --> 00:58:18.325
You can never lose me.
I'm always with you!

00:58:18.327 --> 00:58:19.658
Hi, Dora.

00:58:19.660 --> 00:58:20.794
Backpack!

00:58:20.796 --> 00:58:22.431
My mouth is a zipper!

00:58:23.064 --> 00:58:24.530
- Hi, Dora.
- Hm.

00:58:24.532 --> 00:58:26.666
- I don't know you, small rock.
- Oh.

00:58:26.668 --> 00:58:29.570
- But it's nice to make your acquaintance.
- Ah.

00:58:29.572 --> 00:58:30.836
Everyone is here!

00:58:30.838 --> 00:58:33.409
Whoo-hoo!

00:58:36.345 --> 00:58:38.547
Look! Papi's journal!

00:58:39.682 --> 00:58:40.847
Wait!

00:58:43.452 --> 00:58:44.751
Oh!

00:58:44.753 --> 00:58:46.954
- Ooh.
- You okay, Dora?

00:58:46.956 --> 00:58:49.655
I can't. I'm not ready.

00:58:49.657 --> 00:58:52.460
Take my hand.
Let's try this together.

00:58:53.695 --> 00:58:54.963
Yay!

00:59:03.070 --> 00:59:05.037
Sammy! Randy!

00:59:05.039 --> 00:59:06.275
We've got you, Dora.

00:59:06.775 --> 00:59:08.410
Thanks, guys!

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:16.149
- <i>What do we do?</i>
- <i>Oh, we should sing her a song.</i>

00:59:16.151 --> 00:59:17.450
<i>She likes songs.</i>

00:59:17.452 --> 00:59:18.917
<i>♪ Please be alive, Dora ♪</i>

00:59:18.919 --> 00:59:20.320
<i>♪ Don't be dead ♪</i>

00:59:20.322 --> 00:59:21.720
<i>♪ That sounds like something ♪</i>

00:59:21.722 --> 00:59:23.555
<i>♪ That you would have said ♪</i>

00:59:25.593 --> 00:59:28.227
- Oh, I'm not very good at this.
- It worked!

00:59:28.229 --> 00:59:29.896
She's waking up.

00:59:29.898 --> 00:59:31.300
Hey!

00:59:32.133 --> 00:59:34.033
- Randy?
- Oh, thank goodness.

00:59:34.035 --> 00:59:36.370
Boots!

00:59:36.372 --> 00:59:37.340
Ohh.

00:59:38.139 --> 00:59:40.039
Sammy!

00:59:40.041 --> 00:59:42.177
- Hi.
- You came back.

00:59:43.211 --> 00:59:45.644
- You have a nice voice.
- Well...

00:59:45.646 --> 00:59:47.580
sometimes
a song's the best idea.

00:59:47.582 --> 00:59:48.682
Ohh.

00:59:48.684 --> 00:59:50.015
But not often.

00:59:50.017 --> 00:59:52.253
Oh, and don't tell anyone
I did that.

00:59:53.322 --> 00:59:55.224
You're going to be okay.

01:00:19.213 --> 01:00:22.284
You know, Dora, I...

01:00:24.952 --> 01:00:28.123
I never forgot
about the jungle.

01:00:28.622 --> 01:00:30.025
And you...

01:00:30.726 --> 01:00:33.028
you were my best friend...

01:00:33.996 --> 01:00:36.298
and my first friend.

01:00:36.999 --> 01:00:39.301
I'm glad
I'm here with you, Dora.

01:00:39.934 --> 01:00:41.503
I mean, this...

01:00:42.403 --> 01:00:44.905
this is our next adventure,
<i>prima.</i>

01:00:44.907 --> 01:00:47.209
Our next adventure, <i>primo.</i>

01:00:55.284 --> 01:00:58.186
I... I had the weirdest dream.

01:00:59.655 --> 01:01:01.524
Ah! Ah!

01:01:29.684 --> 01:01:33.854
The entrance to Parapata should
be somewhere in these mountains.

01:01:33.856 --> 01:01:36.021
Oh, that's great.
For the first time,

01:01:36.023 --> 01:01:38.626
I'm actually feeling really good
about how things are...

01:01:47.401 --> 01:01:49.537
Ignore what I just said.

01:01:57.945 --> 01:01:59.646
Whoa.

01:01:59.648 --> 01:02:01.350
This was all hidden down here?

01:02:02.851 --> 01:02:06.188
Well, great.
Now we're stuck in a hole.

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.593
Wow.

01:02:13.061 --> 01:02:15.061
Stars.

01:02:15.063 --> 01:02:16.631
It's a star map.

01:02:17.097 --> 01:02:18.765
Classic us.

01:02:18.767 --> 01:02:22.138
But the stars
aren't in the correct place.

01:02:22.537 --> 01:02:24.338
Awesome.

01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.673
It's a jungle puzzle!

01:02:26.675 --> 01:02:29.575
I don't think
this is a jungle puzzle.

01:02:29.577 --> 01:02:32.378
Mainly because there's no
such thing as a jungle puzzle.

01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:35.948
Listen, I've seen several movies
about the jungle.

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:38.917
To solve this, we have to get
the stars in the right place.

01:02:38.919 --> 01:02:41.187
And when we do,
these big stone wheels will turn

01:02:41.189 --> 01:02:42.523
and the treasure
will be revealed.

01:02:42.525 --> 01:02:44.023
It's gonna be awesome.

01:02:44.025 --> 01:02:45.425
I just need to figure out

01:02:45.427 --> 01:02:47.396
how to move the first piece.

01:02:47.796 --> 01:02:48.898
Oh.

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.934
Are you sure
you should be touching that?

01:02:56.338 --> 01:02:57.839
What is that?

01:02:58.639 --> 01:03:01.173
That does not sound
like a good noise.

01:03:01.175 --> 01:03:04.577
Oh, wait. The stars
are in the right position.

01:03:04.579 --> 01:03:06.447
It's the southern hemisphere.

01:03:07.282 --> 01:03:09.316
I was just looking at it
the wrong way.

01:03:09.318 --> 01:03:11.417
It's still
a jungle puzzle, right?

01:03:13.389 --> 01:03:16.222
Oh! Oh! I don't think
this is a jungle puzzle.

01:03:16.224 --> 01:03:19.725
- This is a <i>puquio.</i>
- What the flip is a <i>puquio?</i>

01:03:19.727 --> 01:03:22.028
It's an ancient
underground aqueduct.

01:03:22.030 --> 01:03:25.865
Inca engineers built some of the most
elaborate irrigation systems ever devised.

01:03:25.867 --> 01:03:28.204
Water, from above, using gravity.

01:03:28.803 --> 01:03:30.169
- Oh!
- Ah, ah!

01:03:30.171 --> 01:03:33.506
- Oh, oh!
- Stop pulling levers, Randy!

01:03:33.508 --> 01:03:36.477
Ahh! I'm trying to find
the off switch!

01:03:44.519 --> 01:03:48.421
Okay, if this is an aqueduct, we just
need to somehow open the sluice gate.

01:03:48.423 --> 01:03:50.055
How do you know
so much about aqueducts?

01:03:50.057 --> 01:03:52.392
We learned about them
last year in history class.

01:03:52.394 --> 01:03:55.564
You were there. It was the week
you wore a lot of red and pink.

01:03:57.398 --> 01:03:59.164
I look at you a lot, okay?

01:03:59.166 --> 01:04:02.501
We need to find the sluice gate.
Where is the sluice gate?

01:04:02.503 --> 01:04:04.872
Please stop saying
"sluice gate."

01:04:14.581 --> 01:04:17.517
That must be the mechanism
that controls the sluice gate.

01:04:17.519 --> 01:04:20.921
That's what it's called, okay? We have
bigger thing to deal with right now!

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:23.388
Everyone give me a hand.
It's gonna take all of us.

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:27.363
One, two, three!

01:04:48.483 --> 01:04:51.816
This is our last chance.
It's now or never.

01:04:51.818 --> 01:04:55.023
Who here can hold their breath
for seven minutes?

01:04:56.057 --> 01:04:57.724
It's hard to tell
with all of this water,

01:04:57.726 --> 01:04:59.658
but I'm assuming none
of your hands are raised.

01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.363
This one's mine.

01:05:42.204 --> 01:05:43.572
Ohh!

01:05:44.506 --> 01:05:45.741
Whoa, ah!

01:06:01.055 --> 01:06:02.789
Ah! Ahh!

01:06:02.791 --> 01:06:04.526
Ah! Whoa!

01:06:19.206 --> 01:06:20.241
Dora!

01:06:20.809 --> 01:06:22.441
- Dora!
- What?

01:06:22.443 --> 01:06:25.211
- Oh, honey. Oh, honey!
- Dora!

01:06:25.213 --> 01:06:26.812
- Mami!
- Oh!

01:06:26.814 --> 01:06:29.182
- My baby girl.
- Honey! Honey!

01:06:29.184 --> 01:06:30.718
Hey! Ohh!

01:06:31.485 --> 01:06:35.220
Randy did it! We're alive!

01:06:35.222 --> 01:06:38.990
- <i>Tía, tío.</i>
- Okay, can somebody please tell me what's going on?

01:06:38.992 --> 01:06:41.595
We were kidnapped by mercenaries
who were after Parapata.

01:06:41.597 --> 01:06:45.633
Oh, I did something epic!
I'm basically a superhero!

01:06:47.102 --> 01:06:48.434
Oh!

01:06:48.436 --> 01:06:49.803
Hi, Dora's parents.

01:06:49.805 --> 01:06:52.070
Okay, honey,
who are all these people?

01:06:52.072 --> 01:06:55.476
We're Dora's friends.
From school.

01:06:56.345 --> 01:06:57.913
Oh.

01:07:00.347 --> 01:07:01.481
It's fine. Fine.

01:07:01.483 --> 01:07:03.283
We're on a field trip.

01:07:03.285 --> 01:07:04.684
And where are the mercenaries?

01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:07.352
Alejandro saved us from them.
And he's with us!

01:07:07.354 --> 01:07:09.254
- Who?
- Your old friend.

01:07:09.256 --> 01:07:13.859
Alejandro, from the university.
You... You sent him your journal.

01:07:13.861 --> 01:07:17.062
My journal was stolen
days before the expedition.

01:07:17.064 --> 01:07:18.733
Bravo team...

01:07:20.133 --> 01:07:22.202
this is Alpha leader.

01:07:22.803 --> 01:07:27.407
You don't know him, do you?

01:07:29.244 --> 01:07:31.343
Ohh. <i>Miércoles.</i>

01:07:31.345 --> 01:07:33.012
- We found them.
- Honey, come here.

01:07:33.014 --> 01:07:36.082
- Get back, kids.
- Delta rendezvous point.

01:07:36.084 --> 01:07:37.617
You have my location.

01:07:37.619 --> 01:07:40.787
- You lied to me.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:07:40.789 --> 01:07:42.856
- No, I outwitted you...
- That's the same thing.

01:07:42.858 --> 01:07:45.894
...as I have outwitted every
adversary that came before you.

01:07:46.561 --> 01:07:47.827
Hey!

01:07:47.829 --> 01:07:49.528
Who would have believed

01:07:49.530 --> 01:07:51.030
that my greatest achievement,

01:07:51.032 --> 01:07:52.298
the final act

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.633
in a prosperous
treasure-hunting career

01:07:54.635 --> 01:07:59.171
would find me squaring off against
a socially inept jungle nerd...

01:07:59.173 --> 01:08:01.841
- Hey, hey, hey!
- ...and three high school losers.

01:08:01.843 --> 01:08:03.376
I don't know them,
so whatever.

01:08:03.378 --> 01:08:06.912
Now, if you please...

01:08:06.914 --> 01:08:08.916
you will lead me to Parapata.

01:08:10.184 --> 01:08:12.551
But you can't get inside.
It's impenetrable.

01:08:14.923 --> 01:08:17.289
- "Impenetrable!" -That
means you can't get inside.

01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:18.925
- I know!
- Okay.

01:08:18.927 --> 01:08:20.027
Shut up!

01:08:21.263 --> 01:08:23.165
You wouldn't want anything
to happen to her...

01:08:24.398 --> 01:08:26.735
now, would you?

01:08:27.268 --> 01:08:29.401
- Of course not.
- Good.

01:08:29.403 --> 01:08:30.903
Good, good.

01:08:30.905 --> 01:08:34.807
So, if everyone just plays nice,
I'll get my gold,

01:08:34.809 --> 01:08:37.579
and you'll be on your way home
safe and sound.

01:08:38.612 --> 01:08:41.115
You're a smart family, right?

01:08:41.883 --> 01:08:45.586
So make the smart choice. Hm?

01:08:48.156 --> 01:08:50.158
We're moving out! Let's go!

01:08:59.166 --> 01:09:02.301
I'm so sorry.
This is all my fault.

01:09:02.303 --> 01:09:04.436
If we do what he says,
we'll be okay.

01:09:04.438 --> 01:09:06.372
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

01:09:06.374 --> 01:09:07.740
No, we're sorry.

01:09:07.742 --> 01:09:09.641
- We love you so much!
- It's our fault.

01:09:09.643 --> 01:09:11.910
Can you all shut up back there?

01:09:11.912 --> 01:09:16.615
I've had to listen to your
mindless positivity for three days!

01:09:16.617 --> 01:09:21.453
Your relentless good-natured
spirit is a holy nightmare!

01:09:21.455 --> 01:09:24.724
So just shut up! Shut up!

01:09:24.726 --> 01:09:28.327
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Shut up!

01:09:28.329 --> 01:09:30.495
No more talking.

01:09:30.497 --> 01:09:33.134
And definitely no more singing.

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:46.511
Why have you stopped here?

01:09:46.513 --> 01:09:48.715
This is it, isn't it?

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:50.249
- No, no, no. It, uh...
- No, no, no.

01:09:50.251 --> 01:09:52.620
- Hey, wait.
- No, please, wait!

01:10:02.095 --> 01:10:03.298
Wow.

01:10:12.607 --> 01:10:14.242
Parapata.

01:10:15.143 --> 01:10:17.342
It's real!

01:10:17.344 --> 01:10:19.846
We make camp
tonight by those gates.

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:21.480
Come on.

01:10:21.482 --> 01:10:22.751
<i>¡Órale!</i>

01:10:36.363 --> 01:10:38.129
No, Boots, quit it! No!

01:10:38.131 --> 01:10:40.067
Papi wants us
to do what they say.

01:11:03.390 --> 01:11:05.960
<i>♪ These boots are made
for walkin' ♪</i>

01:11:11.366 --> 01:11:12.934
What's going on back here?

01:11:15.736 --> 01:11:17.069
- Oops.
- Kids!

01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:18.340
Run!

01:11:24.179 --> 01:11:27.049
Wow, it really is
the deadliest weapon.

01:11:29.517 --> 01:11:31.920
Viper!
What's going on back there?

01:11:36.523 --> 01:11:38.026
Put that down.

01:11:38.593 --> 01:11:40.028
What happened?

01:11:40.527 --> 01:11:42.294
Viper got yo-yoed.

01:11:42.296 --> 01:11:44.329
- Again?
- Again.

01:11:44.331 --> 01:11:46.200
Take the professors
to the gate.

01:11:48.135 --> 01:11:50.338
I spent days
with these brats.

01:11:51.138 --> 01:11:53.442
I know what they'll do next.

01:11:55.477 --> 01:11:57.976
Diego! Sammy!

01:11:57.978 --> 01:11:59.645
Randy! Where are you guys?

01:12:05.519 --> 01:12:06.985
Boots!

01:12:06.987 --> 01:12:08.756
You shouldn't have done that!

01:12:10.592 --> 01:12:14.793
So what if he's a double-crossing
mercenary treasure hunter?

01:12:14.795 --> 01:12:18.099
My parents are gonna show him the
treasure and he's gonna let us all go.

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:25.273
He's gonna kill them,
isn't he?

01:12:28.977 --> 01:12:31.079
He's gonna kill all of us.

01:12:33.247 --> 01:12:34.448
Oh, no.

01:12:36.483 --> 01:12:38.253
I can't save them.

01:12:40.054 --> 01:12:41.956
Not by myself.

01:12:45.660 --> 01:12:47.229
I'm just a kid.

01:12:50.497 --> 01:12:51.531
You're not a kid.

01:12:52.332 --> 01:12:55.801
But you're not
a grownup either, Dora.

01:12:55.803 --> 01:12:57.604
You're a teenager.

01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:59.941
It's a super confusing time.

01:13:01.409 --> 01:13:06.345
But the fact is, you're right...
you can't do it by yourself.

01:13:06.347 --> 01:13:09.448
Good news
is you have friends now.

01:13:09.450 --> 01:13:13.554
And together,
anything is possible.

01:13:15.857 --> 01:13:17.259
Boots, you can talk?

01:13:18.492 --> 01:13:22.194
Boots. Hey, Boots.
Boots, come on. Boots.

01:13:22.196 --> 01:13:24.128
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah.
Ooh, ooh...

01:13:24.130 --> 01:13:26.998
- Hey, did you guys hear that?
- Uh, you talking to a monkey?

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.700
No, no,
Boots was talking to me.

01:13:28.702 --> 01:13:30.535
Maybe she hit her head.

01:13:30.537 --> 01:13:33.338
Come on, guys,
we have to save my parents.

01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:36.508
How? We are teenagers
armed with yo-yos.

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:38.276
All Alejandro wants
is the gold.

01:13:38.278 --> 01:13:40.046
And if we can
get inside Parapata,

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:42.381
we can trade the treasure
for my parents.

01:13:42.383 --> 01:13:45.650
But how are we going
to get into Parapata?

01:13:45.652 --> 01:13:48.053
We're gonna figure it out.
Together.

01:13:49.890 --> 01:13:51.593
Tonight.

01:14:17.617 --> 01:14:18.853
Huh?

01:14:24.224 --> 01:14:25.927
Whatcha got there?

01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:31.398
It's just a little frog.

01:14:34.768 --> 01:14:36.938
Huh? Hmm.

01:14:39.441 --> 01:14:42.510
Oh. Oh, man...

01:14:45.946 --> 01:14:48.482
Good job, golden poison frog.

01:14:54.388 --> 01:14:58.092
There must be a way to open
the gates from the outside.

01:14:58.925 --> 01:15:00.629
Hey, guys, look at these.

01:15:01.528 --> 01:15:03.061
Each one has a lever.

01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:05.463
I was wrong
about jungle puzzles, okay?

01:15:05.465 --> 01:15:08.301
There is no such thing
as a jungle puzzle.

01:15:08.303 --> 01:15:11.736
Wait, don't do that!
Look. Traps.

01:15:11.738 --> 01:15:14.606
Could be arrows, or poison.

01:15:14.608 --> 01:15:17.176
It looks like
there's traps everywhere.

01:15:17.178 --> 01:15:19.247
This is
one heavy security system.

01:15:20.447 --> 01:15:22.916
So, how do we know
which levers to pull?

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.552
There are so many
combinations.

01:15:25.152 --> 01:15:26.521
What the...

01:15:36.664 --> 01:15:39.263
Guys, look down.

01:15:39.265 --> 01:15:41.900
Looks like constellations.

01:15:41.902 --> 01:15:43.802
Classic us. Again.

01:15:43.804 --> 01:15:47.008
This is <i>Yawar
Mayu,</i> the Inca night sky.

01:15:48.808 --> 01:15:52.713
Ah. Look. Some of the stones
retain the light longer.

01:15:53.414 --> 01:15:55.317
This is <i>anka,</i> the eagle.

01:15:55.849 --> 01:15:57.084
Look.

01:15:59.586 --> 01:16:02.186
And that's <i>atuq,</i> the fox.

01:16:02.188 --> 01:16:05.258
That's... right there.

01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.793
This one looks like a serpent.

01:16:08.795 --> 01:16:11.999
- Are there any more?
- This one's <i>otorongo,</i> the jaguar.

01:16:13.334 --> 01:16:15.333
This must be the fourth lever.

01:16:15.335 --> 01:16:18.673
Okay, but...
which one should we pull first?

01:16:21.241 --> 01:16:22.908
Maybe we pull 'em all at once?

01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:25.013
Well, that's a pretty big maybe.

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:29.217
At least if we die,
we all get to die together, right?

01:16:34.655 --> 01:16:36.358
On three, we pull.

01:16:38.759 --> 01:16:40.028
Ready?

01:16:50.137 --> 01:16:51.372
One...

01:16:52.772 --> 01:16:54.008
two...

01:16:54.575 --> 01:16:55.677
three.

01:17:06.687 --> 01:17:09.087
Okay. It's official.
Movies lie.

01:17:21.134 --> 01:17:22.771
It's a jungle puzzle.

01:17:24.338 --> 01:17:28.440
It's a real... freaking...
jungle puzzle.

01:17:28.442 --> 01:17:32.079
That is so awesome!
I'm sorry I doubted you, movies.

01:17:47.327 --> 01:17:49.328
I've never
seen anything like it.

01:17:49.330 --> 01:17:53.300
This is the discovery
of a lifetime!

01:17:58.839 --> 01:18:00.806
I guess
this must be the temple.

01:18:00.808 --> 01:18:03.208
The gold, right?

01:18:03.210 --> 01:18:05.310
This is totally
where the gold's hidden.

01:18:05.312 --> 01:18:08.413
Everything the Inca treasured
will be in here.

01:18:08.415 --> 01:18:09.882
But remember...

01:18:09.884 --> 01:18:12.051
we're explorers,
not treasure hunters.

01:18:12.053 --> 01:18:14.886
We're not treasure hunters,
but Alejandro sure is.

01:18:14.888 --> 01:18:16.490
So let's be quick.

01:18:17.124 --> 01:18:19.661
Come on. I don't do last.

01:18:35.942 --> 01:18:37.378
It's empty.

01:18:37.978 --> 01:18:39.410
I don't get it.

01:18:39.412 --> 01:18:41.078
I don't see any doors.

01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:43.547
This can't be all that there is.

01:18:43.549 --> 01:18:45.851
I don't see any treasure.

01:18:45.853 --> 01:18:49.187
It was probably cleaned
out by Spanish <i>conquistadores.</i>

01:18:49.189 --> 01:18:51.457
Or the British.
Or the French.

01:18:51.459 --> 01:18:53.628
Or the Americans
and the United Fruit Company.

01:18:54.929 --> 01:18:56.364
Oh! Ah!

01:18:57.631 --> 01:19:00.201
I found this bowl.
It could be treasure.

01:19:00.901 --> 01:19:02.234
That's a sun bowl.

01:19:02.236 --> 01:19:04.269
You tilt the bowls
to reflect the sunlight.

01:19:04.271 --> 01:19:06.538
So that must mean there's...

01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:10.108
Look! There's an opening in the
wall for the sun to shine in.

01:19:10.110 --> 01:19:12.110
Well,
this flashlight can be our sun.

01:19:12.112 --> 01:19:14.215
Here, Boots.

01:19:19.385 --> 01:19:21.321
Ooh!

01:19:22.790 --> 01:19:24.222
Huh. Now what?

01:19:24.224 --> 01:19:27.528
We have to angle the bowl
to the right place in the room.

01:19:30.263 --> 01:19:33.998
- Clearly they loved geometry.
- They fit together symmetrically.

01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.538
- The golden ratio!
- 51 degrees.

01:19:39.540 --> 01:19:43.742
Okay, Randy,
angle your bowl 51 degrees to Diego.

01:19:43.744 --> 01:19:45.944
Okay.

01:19:45.946 --> 01:19:48.183
Okay, Diego... to me.

01:19:51.451 --> 01:19:52.686
Yeah.

01:19:53.187 --> 01:19:54.653
Okay.

01:19:54.655 --> 01:19:57.123
Now I'll turn mine 51 degrees

01:19:57.125 --> 01:19:58.893
and we'll see where it lands.

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.266
A door!
It's opening a door, guys.

01:20:08.268 --> 01:20:10.638
- Ah!
- Ha!

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:16.344
Just hold the beam
until the doors are fully open.

01:20:17.879 --> 01:20:21.582
What is that? Some sort
of Ancient Inca group hug?

01:20:25.686 --> 01:20:27.618
It slipped. I'm sorry.

01:20:31.023 --> 01:20:32.324
Oh, guys...

01:20:32.326 --> 01:20:34.529
- you might want to look up.
- Huh?

01:20:35.896 --> 01:20:37.762
The jungle puzzles
are turning on us!

01:20:37.764 --> 01:20:40.267
The door's closing!
Everyone run!

01:20:42.003 --> 01:20:44.772
Come on, Boots!

01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:50.010
Dora, Dora!
Try and pull it open.

01:20:52.812 --> 01:20:53.878
It isn't enough!

01:21:04.157 --> 01:21:06.391
Thank you! Thank you!

01:21:06.393 --> 01:21:09.395
Oh, Boots.
Good job, buddy!

01:21:09.397 --> 01:21:12.500
Whoa. That's some hallway.

01:21:13.834 --> 01:21:16.267
It's like it goes on forever.

01:21:16.269 --> 01:21:19.937
- At the end, is that...
- ...a giant golden monkey?

01:21:19.939 --> 01:21:22.373
We did it, guys.
We found the treasure.

01:21:23.943 --> 01:21:26.046
Wait, these skulls,
they look like a...

01:21:29.416 --> 01:21:30.481
warning.

01:21:31.585 --> 01:21:33.485
Oh, come on!

01:21:46.465 --> 01:21:48.669
Ahh! Spears!

01:21:50.170 --> 01:21:52.671
Okay! Okay, I know
what we have to do.

01:21:52.673 --> 01:21:55.574
When we get to the bottom of the hallway,
we have to jump at the same time.

01:21:55.576 --> 01:21:58.610
- It's too far!
- What? We will never make it!

01:21:58.612 --> 01:22:00.613
No, it's an illusion, okay?
Trust me.

01:22:01.714 --> 01:22:04.451
It's okay, Sammy.
Just let go. It's okay.

01:22:05.786 --> 01:22:06.985
Okay.

01:22:06.987 --> 01:22:10.122
Three, two, one. Go!

01:22:15.161 --> 01:22:16.463
Now! Jump!

01:22:26.307 --> 01:22:31.008
It was a forced perspective.
A trick to fool thieves and trespassers!

01:22:31.010 --> 01:22:32.211
Good job, Diego.

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:34.212
Ancient Inca group hug
for the win, guys.

01:22:45.259 --> 01:22:48.193
The monkey looked a
lot more impressive back there.

01:22:48.195 --> 01:22:49.729
Looks pretty impressive to me.

01:22:50.897 --> 01:22:53.731
- Is that an emerald?
- It's bigger than a basketball!

01:22:53.733 --> 01:22:55.769
I think we found
the treasure, guys.

01:22:56.402 --> 01:22:57.637
No.

01:22:59.072 --> 01:23:00.939
This is the last puzzle.

01:23:00.941 --> 01:23:02.443
Look.

01:23:03.043 --> 01:23:04.778
This is a <i>quipu.</i>

01:23:05.612 --> 01:23:07.781
Inca written language.

01:23:08.415 --> 01:23:11.949
"Make an offering to the Gods...

01:23:11.951 --> 01:23:15.720
of that which is most revered."

01:23:15.722 --> 01:23:18.192
What did the Inca
revere the most?

01:23:18.793 --> 01:23:20.695
That's easy!

01:23:23.496 --> 01:23:25.133
The same as me:

01:23:26.299 --> 01:23:27.899
Gold.

01:23:27.901 --> 01:23:29.267
Oh, crud.

01:23:29.269 --> 01:23:31.903
Thanks for getting through
the tough stuff for me.

01:23:31.905 --> 01:23:35.740
Once again, I only had
to follow Miss Know-It-All,

01:23:35.742 --> 01:23:39.513
and she led me straight to the gold.

01:23:44.317 --> 01:23:45.753
Gold. Gold!

01:23:46.553 --> 01:23:49.089
Lots and lots of gold!

01:23:49.956 --> 01:23:52.958
The answer to the puzzle
is obvious.

01:23:52.960 --> 01:23:56.627
The Incas built monuments
to their gods with it.

01:23:56.629 --> 01:24:02.268
Gold is as close to touching
the sun as the Incas could get.

01:24:30.363 --> 01:24:32.530
It's happening!

01:24:32.532 --> 01:24:34.267
It's happening!

01:24:34.735 --> 01:24:36.737
It's happening!

01:24:37.237 --> 01:24:39.805
I beat you! I won!

01:24:39.807 --> 01:24:43.809
I beat you, I won!
I beat you, I won! Ha!

01:24:43.811 --> 01:24:46.144
The treasure
is going to be mine!

01:24:46.146 --> 01:24:48.279
You were wrong about me,
Alejandro.

01:24:48.281 --> 01:24:50.515
I'm not a know-it-all.

01:24:50.517 --> 01:24:52.985
But by now, I do know you.

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:55.887
I knew that you would
follow us in here.

01:24:55.889 --> 01:24:58.824
And I knew that you would let us
take all the risk for you.

01:24:58.826 --> 01:25:03.694
I knew the final Inca test would carry dire
consequences for those who should fail it.

01:25:03.696 --> 01:25:06.198
Which is why we...

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.167
are over here, and you...

01:25:09.169 --> 01:25:12.569
Well, you're standing
right there.

01:25:14.674 --> 01:25:17.878
Ah! Ahh!

01:25:27.287 --> 01:25:28.822
Oh!

01:25:32.692 --> 01:25:34.626
I'm still alive!

01:25:34.628 --> 01:25:36.927
Powell! Viper!

01:25:36.929 --> 01:25:39.965
Help me!
Get in here! Now!

01:25:39.967 --> 01:25:42.033
My mercenaries
are on their way.

01:25:42.035 --> 01:25:44.368
This isn't over yet!

01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:07.892
- Dora!
- Oh, honey!

01:26:07.894 --> 01:26:11.195
Mami! Papi!
I'm so sorry.

01:26:11.197 --> 01:26:13.297
It's fine.
How cool is this?

01:26:13.299 --> 01:26:15.499
Look at these guys,
that's a real crossbow.

01:26:15.501 --> 01:26:17.235
Honey.
That's a real crossbow, yep.

01:26:17.237 --> 01:26:19.636
It's the Lost Guardians
of Parapata.

01:26:19.638 --> 01:26:23.708
Ridiculous! There are no Lost Guardians.
I made them up.

01:26:23.710 --> 01:26:25.980
No, they're super real, bro.

01:26:52.071 --> 01:26:54.107
I think this is when we perish.

01:26:57.009 --> 01:26:59.045
Dora!

01:27:38.084 --> 01:27:39.984
- Be strong, honey, okay?
- You choose the right thing.

01:27:39.986 --> 01:27:41.889
Yep.

01:29:03.336 --> 01:29:06.339
She did it.

01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:19.820
- Thank you. Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:29:23.889 --> 01:29:25.226
Honey.

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:30.227
It's like nothing I've...

01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:32.433
Ever imagined.

01:29:37.836 --> 01:29:39.807
It's breathtaking.

01:29:42.942 --> 01:29:44.476
Monkey.

01:29:45.411 --> 01:29:49.215
Really big gold monkey.

01:29:53.519 --> 01:29:55.118
Say goodbye
to your little friend.

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:56.520
What is happening?

01:29:56.522 --> 01:29:59.123
- Swiper!
- <i>Adiós,</i> losers!

01:30:01.628 --> 01:30:03.461
Everyone get out of here!

01:30:03.463 --> 01:30:06.330
- What about the gold?
- It doesn't matter!

01:30:06.332 --> 01:30:08.065
Wait, guys! What about me?

01:30:08.067 --> 01:30:09.833
You can't leave me here!

01:30:09.835 --> 01:30:11.869
Dora! Randy! Help me!

01:30:11.871 --> 01:30:14.073
We're a team! Guys!

01:30:16.710 --> 01:30:17.978
Dora, come on!

01:30:23.150 --> 01:30:25.149
I knew the answer was water!

01:30:25.151 --> 01:30:26.751
Can you give me another go?

01:30:26.753 --> 01:30:30.187
I was joking about the gold!
Of course not gold!

01:30:30.189 --> 01:30:32.259
Water is precious!

01:30:32.791 --> 01:30:34.294
Honey, let's go!

01:30:40.799 --> 01:30:42.867
And you'll never
find it now, man!

01:30:42.869 --> 01:30:45.035
We gotta go!
I love Parapata,

01:30:45.037 --> 01:30:46.372
but I don't want
to be stuck here forever.

01:30:52.012 --> 01:30:53.112
Uh-oh.

01:30:54.446 --> 01:30:57.450
- Boots!
- Get off me, monkey!

01:30:58.018 --> 01:30:59.253
Ow!

01:30:59.920 --> 01:31:02.189
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:08.094
Oh, man. The indignity!

01:31:13.834 --> 01:31:15.333
That's it.

01:31:15.335 --> 01:31:17.068
- Dora, no!
- Dora, wait!

01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:19.005
What are you doing?

01:31:44.798 --> 01:31:46.364
- Oh, wow.
- Ah!

01:31:46.366 --> 01:31:49.303
Dora! You did it!

01:32:16.929 --> 01:32:20.798
Should we put up a sign saying,
"Choose the water"?

01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:22.937
No? Okay.

01:32:23.437 --> 01:32:24.302
Dora...

01:32:33.812 --> 01:32:35.946
Hey.

01:32:35.948 --> 01:32:40.219
Look, I know we weren't exactly friends
when this trip started, but I...

01:32:45.924 --> 01:32:47.427
I like you, too.

01:32:50.164 --> 01:32:53.334
- Dora's staring at us again, isn't she?
- Yeah.

01:32:54.701 --> 01:32:56.003
Okay.

01:33:04.744 --> 01:33:06.211
Mom, Dad!

01:33:24.464 --> 01:33:26.767
We have some exciting news.

01:33:28.335 --> 01:33:31.535
We're going back
into the jungle in a few weeks.

01:33:31.537 --> 01:33:35.407
We'll be gone for a few months, no
contact, just us against the elements.

01:33:35.409 --> 01:33:36.641
Mm-hmm.

01:33:36.643 --> 01:33:38.112
Me and your mom.

01:33:39.946 --> 01:33:41.381
And you.

01:33:46.119 --> 01:33:48.222
We're onto something big, Dora.

01:33:50.557 --> 01:33:52.123
About that.

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:54.359
Someone pulled a
lever, not sure who, but...

01:33:54.361 --> 01:33:57.263
- You. You!
- You know who it was.

01:33:57.696 --> 01:33:58.765
I think...

01:34:00.532 --> 01:34:03.303
I think I want to go back
to the city.

01:34:06.372 --> 01:34:08.705
I know the jungle pretty well.

01:34:08.707 --> 01:34:09.774
Okay.

01:34:09.776 --> 01:34:12.046
But high school...

01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:16.247
I think I need more time
to study that culture.

01:34:16.249 --> 01:34:17.548
- Mm.
- Mm-hmm.

01:34:17.550 --> 01:34:20.084
And its indigenous people.

01:34:20.086 --> 01:34:22.790
- Right. Yeah, sure.
- Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh.

01:34:24.022 --> 01:34:26.358
- That's good.
- I love you guys.

01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:28.228
- We love you, too.
- We love you, sweetheart.

01:34:37.269 --> 01:34:41.140
Oh, God, what is happening?

01:34:43.675 --> 01:34:47.313
- She has a life of her own now.
- I'm so happy for her.

01:34:48.048 --> 01:34:49.914
I'm so happy.

01:34:49.916 --> 01:34:52.417
It's gonna be okay, babe.
It's gonna be okay.

01:34:52.419 --> 01:34:54.452
It's not gonna be okay!

01:34:54.454 --> 01:34:59.356
But I'm so happy for her.
