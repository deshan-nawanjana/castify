I can't find Manny's Tingy.

00:13:04.449 --> 00:13:06.905
You know, it's probably time...

00:13:07.244 --> 00:13:10.529
...for him to move on
from that ratty old blanket anyway.

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:12.947
GREG:<i> Manny was given Tingy
right after he was born.</i>

00:13:13.125 --> 00:13:15.413
<i>Back then, Tingy was a fluffy blue blanket.</i>

00:13:15.794 --> 00:13:17.870
<i>But now, it's a couple of pieces of yarn</i>

00:13:18.046 --> 00:13:20.086
<i>held together with raisins and boogers.</i>

00:13:20.424 --> 00:13:22.215
You don't think he cares anymore?

00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:25.924

00:13:27.931 --> 00:13:28.962
What?

00:13:29.307 --> 00:13:30.932
Look at this garbage.

00:13:31.268 --> 00:13:33.889
GREG: <i>My dad and I
don't agree on anything, except for...</i>

00:13:34.146 --> 00:13:35.640
<i>...the comic</i> Li'l Cutie.

00:13:35.772 --> 00:13:38.098
<i>We both hate it.
But we can't stop reading it!</i>

You're my BFF... Best Father Forever!

00:13:42.821 --> 00:13:44.446
- It's not even a joke!
- I know.

00:13:44.781 --> 00:13:48.316
Can we please focus?
We need to find Manny's Tingy.

00:13:48.452 --> 00:13:49.531
(EXHALES) Ohh!

00:13:49.661 --> 00:13:51.453
I'm going to be late for work.

00:13:52.497 --> 00:13:53.778
See you!

Hey, Dad.

00:15:37.727 --> 00:15:39.352
Are you... sweating?

00:15:39.813 --> 00:15:43.763
Yeah, I just finished up
some sports... playing.

00:15:44.025 --> 00:15:45.140
Uh-huh.

00:15:45.819 --> 00:15:47.099
How was your day?

00:15:47.404 --> 00:15:50.524
Horrible! Manny
still hasn't recovered from losing Tingy.

00:15:51.074 --> 00:15:55.368
Well, maybe it's for the best.
I think he should really move on.

00:15:55.996 --> 00:15:57.276
Tingy!

00:15:58.331 --> 00:16:01.451
Tingy! Oh, my gosh, honey,
you found your blanket!

did it end up in the...

You didn't.

You played video games all day.

00:16:41.082 --> 00:16:42.197
Me? (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

00:16:43.251 --> 00:16:46.205
No. I've been playing sports.

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:50.706
That's it! No more
video games for the rest of the summer!

00:16:51.259 --> 00:16:52.290
You can't do that!

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.132
Oh, yeah, I can! I will! I am!

You think this is funny?

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:06.815
It's amusing.

00:17:08.109 --> 00:17:10.897
Well, then how about no video games and...

00:17:11.196 --> 00:17:14.980
...no television for the rest of the summer?
Does that make you laugh?

Dad, no!

00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.992

Frank!

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:45.346
What are you doing?
First Tingy, and now Greg's video games?

00:17:45.647 --> 00:17:47.521
General Lee isn't going to paint himself.

00:17:48.984 --> 00:17:50.182
This is important.

00:17:50.318 --> 00:17:53.936
You can't take away everything they love
and disappear downstairs.

00:17:54.322 --> 00:17:57.193
You need to get
to Greg's level and really engage with him.

00:17:58.076 --> 00:18:00.365
Find an activity you both enjoy.

00:18:01.663 --> 00:18:05.198
What are we going to do,
play <i>Twisted WarlockalL</i> day?

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.786
I hate to say it,
but we have absolutely nothing in common.

00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.210
What Greg needs is a role model.

00:18:11.506 --> 00:18:14.957
Someone he can look up to.
Sit down and talk with him.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:17.466
I do, but he doesn't listen to me.

00:18:17.762 --> 00:18:21.048
Trust me, hanging out
together is no fun for either of us.

00:18:23.184 --> 00:18:24.560
You always complain that your father

00:18:24.686 --> 00:18:25.966
never spent enough time with you

00:18:26.104 --> 00:18:27.384
when you were young.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:31.313
Now you're doing the same thing.

00:18:33.695 --> 00:18:36.316
Be the father you wish
your father had been.

00:18:40.952 --> 00:18:42.233
You're right.

00:18:45.707 --> 00:18:47.664
I should put in more time.

00:18:49.044 --> 00:18:51.001

FRANK: You know...

00:19:09.397 --> 00:19:10.856
...it takes a while to get here

00:19:10.982 --> 00:19:12.357
and it's an effort to get the boat out...

00:19:13.234 --> 00:19:14.693
...but this is what it's all about.

00:19:14.986 --> 00:19:17.442

quality time together.

00:19:19.407 --> 00:19:21.447

Well...

00:19:38.343 --> 00:19:40.300
...we should think about getting back.

00:19:45.266 --> 00:19:46.891
GREG: <i>As bad as this was...</i>

00:19:47.185 --> 00:19:50.803
<i>...Mom 's idea of
a good summer activity was even worse.</i>

00:19:51.106 --> 00:19:52.564
I'm so glad...

00:19:52.857 --> 00:19:54.980
...you all decided
to become founding members

00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:57.233
of the Reading Is Fun Club!

00:19:57.779 --> 00:19:58.810
So...

00:19:59.114 --> 00:20:00.822
...let's share the books you brought.

00:20:06.704 --> 00:20:09.160
I'm not so sure these
qualify as literature.

00:20:09.457 --> 00:20:12.411
How about I get some real books? Classics.

00:20:13.128 --> 00:20:14.752
Something to stimulate your minds.

00:20:16.214 --> 00:20:17.756
I'll be right back!

00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:23.168
Thank you so much, Gregory,
for making the summer a time...

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.012
...to study and write book reports.

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:28.675
You think I want to do this?
My summer's turned into a nightmare.

00:20:28.893 --> 00:20:30.518
You should come with me
to the country club!

two numbers are missing.

00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:54.283
That means there's only
100 different numbers it could be.

I've got it!

00:20:56.254 --> 00:20:59.789

it could be until I get the right one.

MR. JEFFERSON: We were
about to call the police.

00:48:17.018 --> 00:48:21.098
We're very disappointed in you, Rowley.
Very disappointed.

00:48:27.362 --> 00:48:29.153
They let us off easy!

00:48:30.657 --> 00:48:33.942
Why are you upset?
They didn't even yell at us.

00:48:34.202 --> 00:48:35.993
They almost yelled.

00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:39.491
That was nothing. My parents would
have screamed their heads off.

00:48:39.833 --> 00:48:41.291
They're disappointed in me.

00:48:41.543 --> 00:48:43.666
Big deal. Better than getting punished.

00:48:44.045 --> 00:48:47.331

(SIREN WAILING)
- I don't think so.

00:51:38.344 --> 00:51:41.215

getting into trouble with that Rowley kid.

to the country club today.

sneak yourself in and then sneak me in.

to get me past the front desk.

to invite you anymore.

01:03:48.782 --> 01:03:50.063
What kind of music do they play?

01:03:50.367 --> 01:03:52.739
Anything! They can play anything.

01:04:03.547 --> 01:04:04.578
Hey!

01:04:05.299 --> 01:04:06.330
Where were you?

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:09.337
Rodrick, you are going to owe
me the rest of your life.

01:04:10.137 --> 01:04:12.924
I got Löded Diper a gig...

01:04:13.307 --> 01:04:16.012
...playing at Heather Hills' Sweet Sixteen.

01:04:17.311 --> 01:04:18.425
Really?

01:04:18.896 --> 01:04:19.975

Löded Diper activate.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.542
- You have her favorite song.
- Song, check.

01:04:41.835 --> 01:04:43.460
- She wants you in tuxes.
- Tuxes, check.

01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:45.201
You're ignoring
everything I'm saying, aren't you?

01:04:45.297 --> 01:04:46.412
Ignoring you, check.

01:04:46.673 --> 01:04:50.541
Don't worry, little bro.
It's going to be a good show. The best.

01:04:55.766 --> 01:04:59.716
Rowley! What are you doing next week?
Löded Diper needs roadies!

01:05:00.020 --> 01:05:02.143
How can you
stand to be near me when I lied?

01:05:02.773 --> 01:05:04.053
- What?
- I'm a liar.

01:05:04.358 --> 01:05:06.647
You can never trust me again.

01:05:06.777 --> 01:05:08.734
The sacred bond of our
friendship is broken.

01:05:09.029 --> 01:05:12.730
Rowley, I get it.
You didn't want to hurt my feelings.

01:05:14.034 --> 01:05:17.237
And I didn't mean to
get you in trouble with the Cranium Shaker.

01:05:17.704 --> 01:05:19.163
That's all right.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:23.668
It was actually pretty fun.
Now we can say we've really lived.

01:05:23.961 --> 01:05:26.416
So what about the gig?

01:05:26.713 --> 01:05:28.172
I've always wanted to be a roadie!

01:05:36.390 --> 01:05:38.181
Rise and shine, buddy!

01:05:38.892 --> 01:05:40.684
Don't want to be late for work.

01:05:40.978 --> 01:05:44.347
I'll drop you off at
the way to the office, okay?

01:05:45.149 --> 01:05:47.188
GREG: <i>Now Holly knows I'm not a member,</i>

01:05:47.359 --> 01:05:49.435
<i>there's no reason
to sneak into the country club.</i>

01:05:49.736 --> 01:05:51.776
<i>But if my dad finds out I don't really have</i>

01:05:51.947 --> 01:05:54.023

01:05:54.408 --> 01:05:55.522
Thanks, Dad.

01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:02.829
<i>I'm even
considering telling him I got downsized.</i>

01:06:02.958 --> 01:06:04.073
FRANK: Hey.

01:06:06.587 --> 01:06:08.378
GREG: <i>But I don't think he'll like it.</i>

01:06:09.089 --> 01:06:10.880
<i>The thing is, I'm using...</i>

01:06:11.175 --> 01:06:14.460
<i>...so many identities,
I'm having trouble keeping track of them.</i>

01:06:14.761 --> 01:06:16.719
MR. JEFFERSON:
This bill is five times the normal amount.

01:06:17.097 --> 01:06:18.378
I'm sorry, Mr. Jefferson,

01:06:18.557 --> 01:06:22.056
but your son has been
ordering a lot of smoothies this month.

01:06:22.436 --> 01:06:24.227
There he is now.

01:06:24.855 --> 01:06:26.135
That is not my son.

01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:28.064
Of course. That's Roland Gropper.

01:06:28.358 --> 01:06:29.639
Good morning, Arthur!

01:06:29.943 --> 01:06:31.224
Hey, Rowley!

01:06:31.612 --> 01:06:34.399
Rowley! My man! What's up?

01:06:36.783 --> 01:06:39.072
Hey! You forgot your sunblock.

01:06:40.621 --> 01:06:41.652
Frank Heffley.

01:06:42.956 --> 01:06:45.578
Your son racked up
a lot of charges on my account.

01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:48.165
What? He works here. Tell him.

01:06:48.462 --> 01:06:51.997
There must be some mistake.
We don't employ minors.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:04.268
(QUIETLY) Do you not work here?

01:07:07.314 --> 01:07:08.773
Maybe not.

(SIGHS)

01:07:30.504 --> 01:07:33.955
$260 worth of smoothies?
What were you thinking?

01:07:35.175 --> 01:07:37.796
I didn't know
you get charged for what you order.

01:07:42.683 --> 01:07:43.714
I'll pay.

01:07:44.017 --> 01:07:45.048
Very good, sir.

01:08:04.788 --> 01:08:08.655
Aren't you going to yell at me?
Aren't you mad?

01:08:11.211 --> 01:08:12.326
No.

01:08:14.381 --> 01:08:16.670
I'm just disappointed.

01:08:24.224 --> 01:08:25.505
(SIGHS) We've got some serious trouble.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:27.724
Not you. Me.

01:08:28.061 --> 01:08:29.342
Yeah, mostly you.

01:08:29.730 --> 01:08:31.687

STUDENT 1: <i>I used to play video games.</i>

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:02.925
I was playing all the time...
sometimes two hours a day.

01:09:03.263 --> 01:09:06.549
I'd lie to my parents
and tell them I was studying when...

01:09:06.933 --> 01:09:10.267
...really, I'd sneak to the
mall to hang out with my friends.

01:09:10.604 --> 01:09:13.391
My parents sent me to Spag Union.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:15.600
My parents sent me to Spag Union.

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:18.440
I don't waste my time
with video games anymore.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.652
Spag Union taught me there's more

01:09:20.822 --> 01:09:22.731

You have 48 hours to
prove to Dad you don't need Spag Union.

01:09:54.856 --> 01:09:55.936
How?

01:09:56.817 --> 01:10:00.945
By being the all-time
best Wilderness Explorer there ever was.

You can't go to Spag Union!
I don't want to go to school without you!

Come on, Stan. There's
plenty of good sites.

Give me a break. You don't know the
first thing about camping.

BARRETT: You know the rules,
Stan. Whoever gets

01:11:25.113 --> 01:11:27.355
here first gets the pick of the campsites.

01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:31.067
The best way to
lay claim to a camp is to put tents on it.

Doesn't look like there's any room...

...for troops here,
but there's still plenty of good sites.

01:12:24.297 --> 01:12:29.090
Yeah, it's mighty convenient
being so close to the bathrooms.

01:12:39.354 --> 01:12:42.106
You all know the story
of the muddy hand, don't you?

01:12:43.483 --> 01:12:46.270
It was a dark and stormy
night, like this one.

01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:47.933
It is not stormy.

01:12:48.196 --> 01:12:51.945
In these very woods,
an old woodsman, a kindly soul...

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.992
...was chopping wood in the rain for

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.987
a group of Wilderness Explorers.

01:12:56.454 --> 01:12:57.486
So what happened?

01:12:57.622 --> 01:12:58.701
FREGLEY: Nothing.

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:00.326
If you consider the old woodsman

01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:02.665
chopping off his own hand was nothing!

01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.956
Didn't the Wilderness Explorers help him?

01:13:05.088 --> 01:13:06.119
FREGLEY: No.

01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:08.213
They got scared and ran away.

01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:09.462
Why would they do that?

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:12.006
Back at camp, the boys got to talking.

01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:15.549
They decided that
they should have helped the old woodsman

01:13:15.682 --> 01:13:17.306
because he was helping them.

01:13:17.684 --> 01:13:21.516
But when they got
back to his cottage, his body was gone!

01:13:21.896 --> 01:13:22.928
Gone?

01:13:23.064 --> 01:13:24.689
All that was left...

01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:26.649
...was his hand!

01:13:26.901 --> 01:13:28.645
I don't like this story.

01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:32.813
Not one of those boys was ever seen again.

01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:35.406
The only clue to what happened was

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.819
a muddy handprint on the side of the tent.

01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:40.532
They say the muddy hand
is still out there...

01:13:41.541 --> 01:13:44.210
...looking for more Wilderness Explorers...

01:13:45.211 --> 01:13:46.243
...and...

01:13:46.671 --> 01:13:48.000
...revenge!

01:13:50.050 --> 01:13:51.330
I don't buy it.

01:13:51.885 --> 01:13:53.842

- Do what?
- Hit me in the hand with a mallet!

- Me?
- Yeah, you, with the mallet in your hand!

Why am I mad?

01:14:41.101 --> 01:14:42.844
Because I keep messing up.

01:14:44.229 --> 01:14:48.013
Look, everybody messes up. Even me.

01:14:50.235 --> 01:14:52.856

They weren't even arranged in formation!
What a bunch of losers.

Don't make things worse.
You'll end up at Spag Union for sure.
