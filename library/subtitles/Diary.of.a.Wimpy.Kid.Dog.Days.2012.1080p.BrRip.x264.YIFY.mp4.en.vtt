540

<i>Mom and Dad make us all go. Which is bad...</i>

541
00:31:45.152 --> 00:31:48.272

doesn't pass the smell test.

544
00:31:53.661 --> 00:31:55.321
Yes, it does. It totally does!

545
00:31:59.834 --> 00:32:00.829
Here, sweetie.

546
00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.955
Thanks.

547
00:32:06.173 --> 00:32:08.960
With my boys, it's go, go, go!

548
00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:11.132
I have to wrestle them in every night.

Same with my boys.

550
00:32:13.597 --> 00:32:16.883
They're in my Wilderness
Explorers troop now. They love it!

551
00:32:17.184 --> 00:32:19.971
I loved being in the Wilderness Explorers.

552
00:32:20.604 --> 00:32:22.312
- You did?
- Yeah. Loved it.

553
00:32:22.606 --> 00:32:26.307
That one camping trip
we took as kids, you cried the whole time.

554
00:32:27.194 --> 00:32:30.148
Well, I broke my arm in two places.

555
00:32:31.282 --> 00:32:32.313
Cried the whole time.

Yeah, I...

557
00:32:34.368 --> 00:32:35.483
It hurt.

558
00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:39.321
You know what?
You should join the Wilderness Explorers.

559

I'm more of an indoor person.

560
00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:43.239
Exactly. When's the next meeting?

561
00:32:43.544 --> 00:32:45.537
The waiting list for our
troop is a mile long.

Is that your dog? We grew up with a dog.

565
00:32:52.386 --> 00:32:54.343
Nutty. Frank named him.

566
00:32:54.638 --> 00:32:56.927
You can never be too young
to learn responsibility.

567
00:32:57.057 --> 00:32:58.682
You should get your boys a dog.

568
00:32:59.727 --> 00:33:01.684
Yeah. That's a great idea.

569
00:33:06.317 --> 00:33:09.187
I think I'll speak to Dad
about my suspicions.

570
00:33:09.904 --> 00:33:11.279
Do whatever you want.

571
00:33:13.073 --> 00:33:14.354
I will.

I don't really have a job.

Holly Hills is a member,

00:33:24.043 --> 00:33:26.119

I can hang out with her.

So is Heather Hills there, too?

579
00:33:32.593 --> 00:33:34.217
- Heather who?
- I want in.

580
00:33:35.095 --> 00:33:37.468
I can't get you in there.
I go as Rowley's guest.

581
00:33:37.765 --> 00:33:39.307
I'll go as your guest.

582
00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:41.593
I can't bring the guest. I am the guest.

583
00:33:41.727 --> 00:33:43.138
There's no guest for the guest.

No.

Very good, sir.

Aren't you mad?

Stan. Whoever gets

1131
01:11:25.113 --> 01:11:27.355
here first gets the pick of the campsites.

1132
01:11:27.616 --> 01:11:31.067

but there's still plenty of good sites.

Yeah, it's mighty convenient
being so close to the bathrooms.

1145

You all know the story
of the muddy hand, don't you?

1146
01:12:43.483 --> 01:12:46.270
It was a dark and stormy
night, like this one.

1147
01:12:46.653 --> 01:12:47.933
It is not stormy.

1148
01:12:48.196 --> 01:12:51.945
In these very woods,
an old woodsman, a kindly soul...

1149
01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:53.992
...was chopping wood in the rain for

1150
01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:55.987
a group of Wilderness Explorers.

1151
01:12:56.454 --> 01:12:57.486
So what happened?

1152
01:12:57.622 --> 01:12:58.701
FREGLEY: Nothing.

1153
01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:00.326
If you consider the old woodsman

1154
01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:02.665
chopping off his own hand was nothing!

1155
01:13:03.378 --> 01:13:04.956
Didn't the Wilderness Explorers help him?

1156
01:13:05.088 --> 01:13:06.119
FREGLEY: No.

1157
01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:08.213
They got scared and ran away.

1158
01:13:08.383 --> 01:13:09.462
Why would they do that?

1159
01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:12.006
Back at camp, the boys got to talking.

1160
01:13:12.679 --> 01:13:15.549
They decided that
they should have helped the old woodsman

1161
01:13:15.682 --> 01:13:17.306
because he was helping them.

1162
01:13:17.684 --> 01:13:21.516
But when they got
back to his cottage, his body was gone!

1163

Gone?

1164
01:13:23.064 --> 01:13:24.689
All that was left...

1165
01:13:25.025 --> 01:13:26.649
...was his hand!

1166
01:13:26.901 --> 01:13:28.645
I don't like this story.

1167
01:13:29.029 --> 01:13:32.813
Not one of those boys was ever seen again.

1168
01:13:33.199 --> 01:13:35.406
The only clue to what happened was

1169
01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:37.819
a muddy handprint on the side of the tent.

1170
01:13:38.705 --> 01:13:40.532

is still out there...
