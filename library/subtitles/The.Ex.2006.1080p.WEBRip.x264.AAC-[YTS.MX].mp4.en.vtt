SOFIA KOWALSKI: Allan?

00:00:35.483 --> 00:00:36.316
TOM REILLY: No.

00:00:36.441 --> 00:00:37.459
SOFIA KOWALSKI: Christoper?

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:39.275
TOM REILLY: Hm, no.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:40.441
Nigel?

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:41.733
No.

00:00:41.858 --> 00:00:43.191
[sighs]

00:00:43.316 --> 00:00:44.941
Leonard, that's cute.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:46.441
That's so cute!

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.816
We have a little fat kid
that likes internet porn.

00:00:48.941 --> 00:00:49.775
What about Hans?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.691
What about Adolf?

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:51.816
That's great.

00:00:51.858 --> 00:00:53.900
It rings, rolls off the tongue.

00:00:54.025 --> 00:00:55.858
Charles!

00:00:55.983 --> 00:00:57.233
It's a classic.

00:00:57.358 --> 00:00:58.917
You can't find anything
wrong with Charles.

00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:00.191
Are you kidding me?

00:01:00.316 --> 00:01:02.076
Do you know what the
nickname for Charles is?

00:01:02.191 --> 00:01:02.983
What?

00:01:03.108 --> 00:01:04.691
Chucky.

00:01:04.816 --> 00:01:06.126
How am I supposed
to fall asleep with

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.667
a little red-haired
toddler named Chucky

00:01:07.691 --> 00:01:08.731
sleeping in the next room?

00:01:08.775 --> 00:01:09.775
Just forget the book, OK?

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.525
We don't need the book.

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.150
Let's come up with our own name,
like Apple or Destiny's Child.

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:17.608
I got an idea.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.900
Just look at me, right?

00:01:20.025 --> 00:01:22.358
What's the first name
that pops into your head?

00:01:22.483 --> 00:01:23.483
Doofus.

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:24.941
[giggles]

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:26.150
OK, you go.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.150
First name that
pops into your head.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:29.775
Boobies.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.483
You want to name
our child Boobies?

00:01:31.608 --> 00:01:33.275
I'm saying that I'm open to it.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.275
Honey.

SOFIA KOWALSKI:
Sweetie, the book

00:01:38.441 --> 00:01:39.459
says it's best to
come up with a name

00:01:39.483 --> 00:01:40.316
before the birth of the baby.

00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:41.441
[sighs]

00:01:41.483 --> 00:01:42.584
Will you relax with the book?

00:01:42.608 --> 00:01:43.608
You're obsessed.

00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:45.233
Honey!

00:01:45.358 --> 00:01:47.525
You know doing research makes
me feel more comfortable.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.733
Speaking of which, I've
decided not to do an epidural.

00:01:50.858 --> 00:01:51.650
What?

00:01:51.775 --> 00:01:53.191
Yep.

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:55.400
Apparently, natural childbirth's
better for the baby.

00:01:55.525 --> 00:01:58.525
But everybody says
the pain is unbearable.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.316
Whatever's best
for Baby Big Nose.

00:02:01.441 --> 00:02:02.983
Big nose?

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:05.228
Oh sorry that's just the
name that popped into my head

00:02:05.275 --> 00:02:07.816
when I was looking at you.

00:02:07.941 --> 00:02:09.566
Oh, that's very funny.

00:02:09.691 --> 00:02:11.025
That's very funny.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.441
[screams] [laughter]

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:13.400
Honey, please!

00:02:13.525 --> 00:02:16.150
You're making me pee!

00:02:16.275 --> 00:02:17.441
Whoa, whoa. Look at the time.

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:18.983
- I've got to go.
- Oh.

00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:20.108
Promotion day.

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:23.191
Good luck, sweetheart.

00:02:23.316 --> 00:02:25.191
Hey, I love you.

00:02:25.316 --> 00:02:26.316
I love you.

00:02:32.025 --> 00:02:32.900

How the hell are you, man?

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:37.858
What's going on?

00:02:37.983 --> 00:02:38.733
Good, Forrest.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:40.400
How are you?

00:02:40.525 --> 00:02:42.645
The last time I saw you,
you were with Sofia Kowalski.

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:44.983
Yeah, we... we got
married actually.

00:02:45.108 --> 00:02:46.483
Way to go, man.

00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:48.209
You know I was never one
of the people that said

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:49.400
she was out of your league.

00:02:49.525 --> 00:02:50.691
In their face, right?

00:02:50.816 --> 00:02:52.358
Yeah.

00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:53.563
We're about to have a baby.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.358
Congratulations
that's fantastic!

00:02:55.483 --> 00:02:56.775
Yeah, good stuff.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.251
My wife and I just did
that deal in December.

00:02:58.275 --> 00:03:00.316
Kids are expensive
as hell though.

00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:02.441
You know I just made
SVP at Armstrong,

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:06.108
making 500 grand a year and
we're barely making ends meet.

00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.584
We just got a beach
house in the Hamptons.

00:03:07.608 --> 00:03:08.900
Oh.

00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:12.733
Piece of advice, you
want the most ass ever?

00:03:12.858 --> 00:03:14.066
Please.

00:03:14.191 --> 00:03:15.209
Get your wife a beach house.

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:16.775
Oh.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.733
I'm serious I can't
keep her off my junk.

00:03:18.858 --> 00:03:20.691
I'll have to remember that.

00:03:20.816 --> 00:03:22.334
Hey, come out to
the Hamptons sometime.

00:03:22.358 --> 00:03:23.483
We'll go sailing.

00:03:23.608 --> 00:03:24.667
- I'll bring my yacht!
- Even better.

00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:26.108
- OK.
- All right.

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:29.691
$500,000 a year,
can you believe that?

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:31.108
I went to school
with this idiot,

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:34.358
he's one of the stupidest
people I ever met.

00:03:34.483 --> 00:03:35.816
Where did I go wrong?

00:03:35.941 --> 00:03:36.941
Dude, you're a cook.

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:38.525
I know.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:39.917
Should've become
a hedge fund guy,

00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.566
I'd be getting ass
out in East Hampton.

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:45.358
OK people!

00:03:45.483 --> 00:03:47.441
There's a lot of hungry
stockbrokers up there.

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:48.733
They're counting on you.

00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:54.233
What's wrong?

00:03:54.358 --> 00:03:55.709
Somebody left a bunch
of salmon out overnight.

00:03:55.733 --> 00:03:57.400
Leon's docking everybody's pay.

00:03:57.525 --> 00:03:58.691
That's ridiculous.

00:03:58.816 --> 00:04:00.733
Well, you've got
to talk to him, Tom.

00:04:00.858 --> 00:04:02.025
No, no, no, no, no.

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:03.150
Not me this time, guys.

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:04.733
Sorry.

00:04:04.858 --> 00:04:06.084
Tommy, you're the only guy
that can stand up to him.

00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:07.417
Paco, my wife's
about to have a baby.

00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:08.733
I need this promotion.

00:04:08.858 --> 00:04:10.292
Well this guy's going
to dock our pay, man.

00:04:12.025 --> 00:04:13.233
Let's go, ladies!

00:04:13.358 --> 00:04:14.941
I don't pay you to
stand around all day.

00:04:15.066 --> 00:04:16.233
Hey, Summers.

00:04:16.358 --> 00:04:17.858
Look I need you to
work on Sunday, OK?

00:04:17.983 --> 00:04:19.834
Leon my sister's getting
married on Sunday, remember?

00:04:19.858 --> 00:04:21.400
Oh. Well, you know what?

00:04:21.525 --> 00:04:22.917
You got to tell me that when
I'm making out the schedule.

00:04:22.941 --> 00:04:24.334
I can't keep track of
everyone's social life.

00:04:24.358 --> 00:04:25.542
- I did tell you.
- I'll sub for him, Leon.

00:04:25.566 --> 00:04:27.816
Paco, silencio.

00:04:27.941 --> 00:04:29.108
Summers, I'm sorry.

00:04:29.233 --> 00:04:31.566
You got to be here
Sunday, that's it.

00:04:31.691 --> 00:04:33.150
I don't make the rules.

00:04:33.275 --> 00:04:34.275
Oh wait, yes I do.

00:04:37.275 --> 00:04:38.515
You got something to say Riley?

00:04:38.608 --> 00:04:40.816
'Cause, uh, I'd love to hear it.

00:04:40.941 --> 00:04:43.025
Leon, you're an asshole.

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.775
And you're fired.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:45.650
What?

00:04:45.775 --> 00:04:46.900
Oh, ay dios mio.

00:04:47.025 --> 00:04:48.650
You heard me,
Banderas, hit the road.

00:04:48.775 --> 00:04:50.691
Go on back to your
10-family shack

00:04:50.816 --> 00:04:52.400
and watch Telemundo all day.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:53.858
I don't give a shit, all right?

00:04:59.858 --> 00:05:01.775
OK, we both got a
little carried away.

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.191
I admit it, you admit it.

00:05:03.316 --> 00:05:05.233
Let's... let's just have
a cool down period, OK?

00:05:05.358 --> 00:05:06.376
Do you want to use my apron?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:07.480
I can get most of that off.

00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:11.292
Are you kidding
me, [inaudible]??

00:05:11.316 --> 00:05:12.775

with a pork chop!

Stop, stop, stop, stop!

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.941
Come on!

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:22.941
We're sor... We're sorry.

00:05:23.066 --> 00:05:24.150
We're sorry. We're sorry.

00:05:24.275 --> 00:05:25.066
We're sorry.

00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:25.983
We're sorry.

00:05:26.108 --> 00:05:28.983
You're fired too.

Oh I'm so fat.

Don't give me that
crazy look, Kimmie.

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:05.650
I see you.

00:06:05.775 --> 00:06:07.626
I have too much to do before
I got to get out of here.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:08.441
KAREN: Hey, Sof.

00:06:08.566 --> 00:06:10.108
Can I ask you something?

00:06:10.233 --> 00:06:12.941
Do you really think you can
raise a kid on Tom's salary?

00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:15.400
He's getting promoted
to Head Lunch Chef.

00:06:15.525 --> 00:06:17.108
We're going to be fine.

00:06:17.233 --> 00:06:19.126
I have to say I have a hard
time seeing you as a housewife.

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.108
I am not going
to be a housewife.

00:06:21.233 --> 00:06:23.441
I'm going to be a full-time mom.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:25.066
Of course, yeah.

00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:30.733

Hello?

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.941
Now?

00:06:40.066 --> 00:06:41.251
Tom's self-conscious 'cause his

00:06:41.275 --> 00:06:42.608
peep has a little curve to it.

00:06:42.733 --> 00:06:43.983
[laughter]

00:06:44.108 --> 00:06:45.400

00:06:47.316 --> 00:06:48.650
What are you two giggling about?

00:06:48.775 --> 00:06:51.316
Your cute little curve.

00:06:51.441 --> 00:06:53.566
I'll get you another pillow.

00:06:53.691 --> 00:06:56.650
Babe, please don't
talk about my curve.

00:06:56.775 --> 00:06:57.858
My curve is private.

00:06:57.983 --> 00:07:00.025
Sweetie, she's
our delivery nurse.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.670
Eventually she's

What now?

00:07:04.941 --> 00:07:06.417
Most women poop at some
point during the birth,

00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:07.191
I told you that.

00:07:07.316 --> 00:07:08.483
No, no.

I'm pretty sure I
would remember that.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.608
So, which way does it curve?

00:07:11.733 --> 00:07:12.525
Don't answer that.

it's just her left.

00:07:20.816 --> 00:07:22.025
It's OK.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.400
Really.

00:07:23.525 --> 00:07:25.400
It's the most natural
thing in the world.

00:07:25.525 --> 00:07:27.084

00:07:32.066 --> 00:07:33.834
I told you those contractions
were going to get stronger.

00:07:33.858 --> 00:07:35.458
But don't worry, you
still have some time

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:36.941
before they get real nasty.

00:07:37.066 --> 00:07:38.191
That wasn't nasty?

00:07:38.316 --> 00:07:39.608
That wasn't nasty?

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:40.816
Hell no.

00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:42.191
Tom, I think I changed my mind.

00:07:42.316 --> 00:07:43.108
I want the drugs.

00:07:43.233 --> 00:07:44.483

00:07:44.608 --> 00:07:47.066
I... I... I could probably
score you some weed.

00:07:47.191 --> 00:07:49.275
Sophia, you turned
down the epidural.

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:51.733
And the anesthesiologist
is in surgery now.

00:07:51.858 --> 00:07:53.358
Baby, what about
all the research?

00:07:53.483 --> 00:07:54.233

and now she totally regrets it.

She's in a lot of pain...

have a name for our son.

a setback, baby.

But we're going to
get through this.

00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:51.510
The important thing
is that we have

00:09:51.608 --> 00:09:54.858

And we love each other, right?

00:10:05.608 --> 00:10:07.208
Do you remember how
we decided that I was

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:08.900
going to stay home
with our baby and you

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:10.316
were going to support us?

00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:11.626
But Sofia, it was the
principle of the thing.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:12.876
You should have seen this go...

It's always the
principle of the thing!

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.920
First it was a museum
job, but then you

00:10:17.025 --> 00:10:19.126
didn't want to turn into a
pretentious social climber.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.775

become a magazine

tell your editor he's a whore.

00:10:22.775 --> 00:10:23.983
Not an actual whore, Sofia.

00:10:24.108 --> 00:10:26.358
A whore to the
entertainment industry.

00:10:26.483 --> 00:10:28.775

They don't like what they
do, they hate their boss,

00:10:35.191 --> 00:10:37.551
they're bored most of the time,
that's what having a job is!

00:10:37.608 --> 00:10:38.608
Mm-hmm.

00:10:40.733 --> 00:10:42.275
OK, well.

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.441
What if this whole thing
was a message from God?

00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:48.150
What do you think
God's trying to tell us?

00:10:48.275 --> 00:10:50.167
Maybe he's trying to tell
us that it's time for us

00:15:21.858 --> 00:15:23.618
You know, I've been
here longer than anybody.

00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:24.900
30 years.

00:15:25.025 --> 00:15:27.316
Last year, a
visionary took over.

00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:30.066
His name, Don Wollebin.

00:15:30.191 --> 00:15:31.275
Guys!

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.800
Guys, I want you
to meet Tom Reilly,

00:15:32.858 --> 00:15:34.858
our new assistant
associate creative.

00:15:34.983 --> 00:15:37.025
[BOTH] Hey, Tom.

00:15:37.150 --> 00:15:37.900
It's Manny.

00:15:38.025 --> 00:15:39.441
- He's Doug.
- Oh oh.

00:15:39.566 --> 00:15:40.650
- Oh oh.
- Oh.

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:42.066
Oh oh. DOUG: What's that?

00:15:42.191 --> 00:15:43.191
What you trying to do?

00:15:43.233 --> 00:15:44.650
Is that going somewhere?

00:15:44.775 --> 00:15:45.816
It's off.

00:15:45.941 --> 00:15:46.941
Catch.

00:15:47.025 --> 00:15:47.816
Whoa.

00:15:47.941 --> 00:15:49.316
Whoops.

00:15:49.441 --> 00:15:50.608
Nice, Manny!

00:15:50.733 --> 00:15:51.941
Can't let my man down.

00:15:52.066 --> 00:15:53.525
You got to catch it, Tom.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.691
The yes ball gets thrown
around the office all day long.

00:15:56.816 --> 00:15:59.691
It's a way of showing
that we're all in sync.

00:15:59.816 --> 00:16:01.191
Oh.

00:16:01.316 --> 00:16:02.626
Once you start thinking
about stuff in a new way,

00:16:02.650 --> 00:16:05.025
it'll turn your whole
world upside down.

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:05.983
Ha ha.

00:16:06.108 --> 00:16:07.108
Come on.

00:16:09.525 --> 00:16:12.275
[WHISPERS] Oh my god.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.858
BOB KOWALSKI: People just
aren't eating as much fried fish

00:16:14.983 --> 00:16:16.150
anymore.

00:16:16.275 --> 00:16:19.066
So Don says, let's
shift the paradigm.

00:16:19.191 --> 00:16:22.941
Forget fried fish, let's
reinvent the tartar sauce

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:27.066
as a hamburger spread,
call it Pickle Whip,

00:16:27.191 --> 00:16:28.983
and sell it to teenagers.

00:16:29.108 --> 00:16:30.191
That's classic Wollebin.

00:16:30.316 --> 00:16:31.525
[laughter]

00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:33.150
BOB KOWALSKI: No question.

00:16:33.275 --> 00:16:36.191
Now last but not least, I
want to introduce all of you

00:16:36.316 --> 00:16:40.608
to our new assistant associate
creative, Tom Reilly!

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.400
[applause]

00:16:44.233 --> 00:16:45.358
Thank you all.

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:46.917
I'm sure that this
experience will...

00:16:46.941 --> 00:16:47.691
Sit down, Tom.

00:16:47.816 --> 00:16:48.900
It's all right.

00:16:49.025 --> 00:16:51.900
Hey, Tom.

00:16:52.025 --> 00:16:55.691
[laughter]

00:16:55.816 --> 00:16:57.066
MAN: Throw it.

00:16:57.191 --> 00:17:03.733
[chatter]

00:17:03.858 --> 00:17:04.858
BOB KOWALSKI: Yes!

00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:09.358
Oh I don't want too many.

00:17:09.483 --> 00:17:10.275
Or do I?

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.900
[chatter]

00:17:12.025 --> 00:17:13.025
Go long!

00:17:15.775 --> 00:17:16.608
Come on, buddy.

00:17:16.733 --> 00:17:17.773
You got to jump for those.

00:17:21.525 --> 00:17:22.525
Uh, unfortunately I

00:17:22.566 --> 00:17:24.108
I can't.

00:17:24.233 --> 00:17:27.608
And I... and I haven't been
able to, Tom, since I was five.

00:17:30.608 --> 00:17:31.808
It's great to meet you though.

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.358
My name's Chip Sanders.

00:17:34.483 --> 00:17:36.691
This is the guy you're
going to be working under.

00:17:36.816 --> 00:17:40.066
[music playing]

00:17:41.650 --> 00:17:42.983
Hey, Chip.

00:17:43.108 --> 00:17:44.542
I... I'm really sorry
about what just happened.

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:45.400
I feel like an idiot.

00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:47.191
Hold it right there, Tom.

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.566
We don't apologize at Sunburst.

00:17:49.691 --> 00:17:53.150
You know the Japanese have
a term called moushiwake.

00:17:53.275 --> 00:17:55.400
It's a way of
saying you're sorry

00:17:55.525 --> 00:17:57.400
and taking responsibility.

00:17:57.525 --> 00:18:00.150
At Sunburst, if you feel
you've fallen short,

00:18:00.275 --> 00:18:05.733
you write a moushiwake on one
of these little yellow pads.

00:18:05.858 --> 00:18:07.608
Here, there you go.

00:18:07.733 --> 00:18:10.191
Just go ahead, write it down.

00:18:10.316 --> 00:18:13.025
Chip, I'm sorry I threw
the imaginary ball...

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:14.230
It's supposed to be silent.

00:18:20.941 --> 00:18:22.275
Tom, don't you worry about it.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.880
If I got depressed
every time somebody

00:18:23.983 --> 00:18:25.542
made a joke at my expense,
I'd never get out of bed.

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:26.626
Oh, I wasn't making a joke.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:27.900
I didn't

00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:30.233
Tom, you'll be working
under the best here.

00:18:30.358 --> 00:18:32.191
Oh, sticky.

00:18:32.316 --> 00:18:33.566
I'm sorry.

00:18:33.691 --> 00:18:36.941
Chip just won Ohio
Advertiser of the Year.

00:18:37.066 --> 00:18:38.358
Oh, congratulations.

00:18:38.483 --> 00:18:40.066
I don't do it for the awards.

00:18:40.191 --> 00:18:45.733
He created Senor Tomato for
the Ketchup Caliente Campaign.

00:18:45.858 --> 00:18:47.483
Caliente!

00:18:47.608 --> 00:18:48.608
[laughter]

00:18:48.691 --> 00:18:50.400
[speaking Spanish]

00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:51.525
I love this guy.

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:53.066
Yeah I'm pretty proud of him.

00:18:53.191 --> 00:18:54.917
There's not a lot of Latino
characters in advertising.

00:18:54.941 --> 00:18:58.650
Oh he seems like a
really nice role model.

00:18:58.775 --> 00:19:03.441
Well it's nice to do
well, but also to do good.

00:19:03.566 --> 00:19:04.941
[speaking Spanish]

00:19:05.066 --> 00:19:06.358
[baby laughs]

00:19:06.483 --> 00:19:07.775
SOFIA KOWALSKI:
Look whose awake.

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:09.441
It's Mr. Stinky Winky.

00:19:09.566 --> 00:19:12.775
[baby laughs]

00:19:13.983 --> 00:19:16.525
It's Mr. Stinky Winky's pinkies.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:20.108
You made mommy a nice
little poo, a stinky poo.

00:19:20.233 --> 00:19:21.483
Yes you did.

00:19:21.608 --> 00:19:26.400
[adult baby talk]
He backed away.

00:19:26.525 --> 00:19:30.483
His hand holding the
purple crayon shook.

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:33.441
You don't understand a
word I'm saying, do you?

00:19:33.566 --> 00:19:36.400
Johnson told the Senate
subcommittee he was satisfied

00:19:36.525 --> 00:19:39.108
with the President's budget,
even though it represented

00:19:39.233 --> 00:19:41.733
a 6% decrease from last year.

00:19:41.858 --> 00:19:45.108
[music playing]

00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:56.358
So, you married Sofia Kowalski.

00:19:56.483 --> 00:19:58.316
You are one lucky man.

00:19:58.441 --> 00:19:59.441
Thanks.

00:19:59.483 --> 00:20:00.608
You love her, Tom?

00:20:00.733 --> 00:20:01.858
Oh yeah.

00:20:01.983 --> 00:20:03.608
You earn her love
every single day?

00:20:03.733 --> 00:20:05.108
I believe I do, Chip.

00:20:05.233 --> 00:20:06.273
That's all I need to hear.

00:20:10.525 --> 00:20:14.691
So listen, I want you to know
that I don't care whether you

00:20:14.816 --> 00:20:16.525
got this job through
family connections

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:18.150
or had to earn it
like the rest of us.

00:20:18.275 --> 00:20:20.941
What's important is that
you're here and that's awesome.

00:20:21.066 --> 00:20:22.358
OK, well.

00:20:22.483 --> 00:20:24.001
I'm... I'm just excited
to jump in, whatever you

00:20:24.025 --> 00:20:25.084
got for me just let me know...

00:20:25.108 --> 00:20:26.275
Hang on there, killer.

00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.983
We're going to walk
before we run, OK?

00:20:28.108 --> 00:20:30.108
Did you see Karate Kid?

00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:31.066
Yeah.

00:20:31.191 --> 00:20:32.691
Miyagi, Macchio.

00:20:32.816 --> 00:20:34.191
OK?

00:20:34.316 --> 00:20:36.441
And right now we're in the
wax on, wax off period.

00:20:39.608 --> 00:20:42.983
Advertising here,
advertising never here.

00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:50.066
TEEN [ON TV]: She and my
mom got in a heated argument

00:20:50.191 --> 00:20:51.816
and my mom took
her to the ground

00:20:51.941 --> 00:20:54.691
and started hitting her while
my dad stood over top laughing.

00:20:54.816 --> 00:20:55.876
MAN 1 [ON TV]:
Did you later find

00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:57.025
out that that was not true?

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:58.233
Hearsay.

00:20:58.358 --> 00:20:59.718
MAN 2 [ON TV]:
[inaudible] hearsay.

00:20:59.816 --> 00:21:01.775
MAN 1 [ON TV]: Did you
ever hear your sister

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:04.358
say that she hated your mother?

00:21:04.483 --> 00:21:05.566
TEEN [ON TV]: Constantly.

00:21:08.608 --> 00:21:09.941
Hi.

00:21:10.066 --> 00:21:10.941
Hi.

00:21:11.066 --> 00:21:12.400
What are doing?

00:21:12.525 --> 00:21:13.941
Nothing.

00:21:14.066 --> 00:21:15.358
Are those Snaps?

00:21:15.483 --> 00:21:16.275
Yeah.

00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:17.233
That's pretty cool.

00:21:17.358 --> 00:21:18.525
CHILD: It's pretty stupid.

00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:20.566
My dad won't let me
watch TV anymore.

00:21:20.691 --> 00:21:21.441
That's bullshit, dude.

00:21:21.566 --> 00:21:23.566
Yeah.

00:21:23.691 --> 00:21:26.316
This is all I can do.

00:21:26.441 --> 00:21:28.525
You want to trade?

00:21:28.650 --> 00:21:31.483
Just kidding.

00:21:31.608 --> 00:21:33.733
Uh, that on...
That one was a dud.

00:21:33.858 --> 00:21:35.483
It happens.

00:21:35.608 --> 00:21:39.108
So during the school year, I
live with my mom in New Jersey.

00:21:39.233 --> 00:21:41.025
And I spend the summer
here with my dad.

00:21:41.150 --> 00:21:43.275
But he's at work all the time.

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.483
And all my friends
live back in Parsippany

00:21:45.608 --> 00:21:47.233
so it's pretty [inaudible].

00:21:47.358 --> 00:21:50.483
[music playing]

00:21:53.525 --> 00:21:55.233
Hey, think fast.

00:21:55.358 --> 00:21:59.191
[laughs] I'm just
messing with you.

00:21:59.316 --> 00:22:00.650
I'm Carol, by the way.

00:22:00.775 --> 00:22:01.525
Tom.

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:02.733
Hey, Tom.

00:22:02.858 --> 00:22:03.876
- Can I give you some advice?
- Yeah.

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:04.775
Get out of here.

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:06.525
Run, run as fast as you can.

00:22:06.650 --> 00:22:10.150
Walk out that door
and don't look back.

00:22:10.275 --> 00:22:11.025
I'm just kidding.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.941
[laughs] But not really.

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:17.858
[laughs] This is
going to be awesome.

00:22:17.983 --> 00:22:19.263
Somebody's eating Chip's yogurt.

00:22:19.316 --> 00:22:20.501
CHIP SANDERS: Yo,
Carol, watch your legs.

00:22:20.525 --> 00:22:23.441
No breaks, thank you.

00:22:23.566 --> 00:22:24.441
How we doing, gang?

00:22:24.566 --> 00:22:25.358
Huh?

00:22:25.483 --> 00:22:28.650
[music playing]

00:22:31.025 --> 00:22:32.816
Uh oh.

00:22:32.941 --> 00:22:34.900
Either one of you
two guys seen wh...

00:22:35.025 --> 00:22:38.316
[music playing]

00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:44.400
Is this your yogurt?

00:22:44.525 --> 00:22:46.066
Uh huh.

00:22:46.191 --> 00:22:48.351
Oh 'cause... 'cause Bob had
said something about, like,

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:50.900
free snacks in the kitchen.

00:22:51.025 --> 00:22:51.858
Muffins.

00:22:51.983 --> 00:22:53.066
Muffins are for everyone.

00:22:53.191 --> 00:22:54.501
Yogurt's mine,
everyone knows that.

00:22:54.525 --> 00:22:57.941
But listen, my
fault, you're new.

00:22:58.066 --> 00:22:59.667
I'll just... I'll just
go buy you another one.

00:22:59.691 --> 00:23:00.858
No no.

00:23:00.983 --> 00:23:02.858
I'm your mentor, I
should've told you.

00:23:02.983 --> 00:23:04.667
I'll go hungry today,
that'll be my punishment.

00:23:04.691 --> 00:23:05.733
No no, please.

00:23:05.858 --> 00:23:07.126
At least finish
the rest of this.

00:23:07.150 --> 00:23:09.066
No, you've already
done about 2/3

00:23:09.191 --> 00:23:10.631
of that, why don't
you finish it off.

00:23:10.691 --> 00:23:11.400
OK? Enjoy.

00:23:11.525 --> 00:23:15.900
It's peach, my favorite.

00:23:16.025 --> 00:23:19.275
I give you one week.

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.233
SOFIA KOWALSKI: Who is that?

00:23:20.358 --> 00:23:22.691
Who is that?

00:23:22.816 --> 00:23:26.108
Hi, Dad.

00:23:26.233 --> 00:23:27.316
Dad, I pooped today.

00:23:27.441 --> 00:23:28.816
What did you do?

00:23:28.941 --> 00:23:31.441
Can you please change
my diaper, Dad?

00:23:31.566 --> 00:23:32.900
My dad loves Chip.

00:23:33.025 --> 00:23:34.983
He's like the son he never had.

00:23:35.108 --> 00:23:36.816
What about me?

00:23:36.941 --> 00:23:37.691
It's totally different.

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:40.441
You're his son-in-law.

00:23:40.566 --> 00:23:42.150
Chip's a great guy, babe.

00:23:42.275 --> 00:23:45.983
He just, I don't know, he seems
a little angry or something.

00:23:46.108 --> 00:23:47.792
Well maybe you'd be a
little angry too if you'd

00:23:47.816 --> 00:23:49.025
lost the use of your legs.

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:49.900
It's not that.

00:23:50.025 --> 00:23:50.900
I don't... I don't know.

00:23:51.025 --> 00:23:53.358
He just... he's nice.

00:23:53.483 --> 00:23:56.066
I just... I think he
might have a dark side.

00:23:56.191 --> 00:23:58.691
Tom, is your first
week on the job.

00:23:58.816 --> 00:24:00.775
I really hope you're
not picking a fight.

00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:02.566
I'm not saying
anything bad about him.

00:24:02.691 --> 00:24:06.066
Everybody has a dark
side, I have a dark side.

00:24:06.191 --> 00:24:07.941
I'm very dangerous.

00:24:08.066 --> 00:24:08.941
Oh, yeah?

00:24:09.066 --> 00:24:10.900
Yeah.

00:24:11.025 --> 00:24:12.900
Come here.

00:24:13.025 --> 00:24:19.400
[toilet flushes]

00:24:19.525 --> 00:24:21.858
'Sup?

00:24:21.983 --> 00:24:23.566
Who is that person?

00:24:23.691 --> 00:24:25.771
That's Wesley, he's dad
doesn't want him to watch TV.

00:24:30.191 --> 00:24:33.733
I don't see the wisdom of
selling directly to consumers.

00:24:33.858 --> 00:24:35.917
Do you remember we spoke
about Smith and Hawkins, Sir?

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.441
2000% sales growth?

00:24:37.566 --> 00:24:39.275
We've got a
three-pronged strategy,

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.691
web advertising, product
partnerships, and print ads.

00:24:42.816 --> 00:24:44.566
Actually, it's a
four-pronged strategy.

00:24:44.691 --> 00:24:46.108
You forgot about direct mailing.

00:24:46.233 --> 00:24:47.917
Direct mailing is not
part of this strategy.

00:24:47.941 --> 00:24:48.733
Actually it is.

00:24:48.858 --> 00:24:49.650
No it's not.

00:24:49.775 --> 00:24:51.275
Uh, it is Chip.

00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.480
If you'd took the time to
read the report like I did.

00:24:53.525 --> 00:24:56.441
Pages 23 through
29, direct mailing.

00:24:56.566 --> 00:24:59.400
I specifically
said no junk mail.

00:24:59.525 --> 00:25:03.316
Now, no junk mail means
no direct mailing!

00:25:03.441 --> 00:25:06.441
Did my son say
you could do this?

00:25:06.566 --> 00:25:07.775
This meeting is over.

00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:09.816
Goodbye.

00:25:09.941 --> 00:25:13.108
[sighs]

00:25:13.233 --> 00:25:15.150
I'm really sorry.

00:25:15.275 --> 00:25:17.191
I guess I shouldn't
have said that.

00:25:17.316 --> 00:25:20.525
That report was for
internal distribution only.

00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.650
That's what for internal
distribution only means.

00:25:23.775 --> 00:25:27.691
Mr. Hordhaus' son asked
us not to tell his father

00:25:27.816 --> 00:25:29.316
about the direct mailing.

00:25:29.441 --> 00:25:31.900
Because in five years, when
direct mailing takes effect,

00:25:32.025 --> 00:25:33.441
Mr. Hordhaus will be dead.

00:25:33.566 --> 00:25:35.525
MR. HORDHAUS [ON INTERCOM]:
I can still hear you.

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.941
[sighs]

00:25:37.066 --> 00:25:38.941
I guess you can kiss
that account goodbye.

00:25:39.066 --> 00:25:41.400
Bob, I'm really sorry.

00:25:41.525 --> 00:25:42.900
I mean moushiwake.

00:25:43.025 --> 00:25:45.025
I'll... I'll write a, I'll
write a moushiwake, Bob.

00:25:45.066 --> 00:25:47.483
Bob, if anybody should be
writing a moushiwake, it's me.

00:25:47.608 --> 00:25:49.108
Tom is my responsibility.

00:25:49.233 --> 00:25:50.983
Chip, please.

00:25:51.108 --> 00:25:52.941
He's the one who screwed up.

00:25:53.066 --> 00:25:55.108
Wollebin gets back
from Nepal tomorrow.

00:25:55.233 --> 00:25:57.733
I don't want to tell him
you blew a major account

00:25:57.858 --> 00:25:59.316
on your second day.

00:25:59.441 --> 00:26:00.691
I'm going say it was me.

00:26:00.816 --> 00:26:02.358
Oh, no no.

00:26:02.483 --> 00:26:04.459
No I can't let you take the
rap for that, let me do it.

00:26:04.483 --> 00:26:06.650
Absolutely not, Chipper.

00:26:06.775 --> 00:26:10.525
It's my family, I'll
clean up the mess.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:11.441
Well thank you, Bob.

00:26:11.566 --> 00:26:13.483
I... I appreciate that.

00:26:13.608 --> 00:26:14.608
Let's go back to work.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.066
[music playing]

00:26:22.191 --> 00:26:23.233
Hey, uh, Tom?

00:26:23.358 --> 00:26:24.816
It's probably none
of my business

00:26:24.941 --> 00:26:27.733
but, um, I doubt I'd ever
let my father-in-law take

00:26:27.858 --> 00:26:29.233
the bullet for me like that.

00:26:29.358 --> 00:26:31.042
You know what, Chip, it
is none of your business.

00:26:31.066 --> 00:26:33.566
Sofia.

00:26:33.691 --> 00:26:36.025
We are the Tigers!

00:26:36.150 --> 00:26:37.900
And we're not cocky.

00:26:38.025 --> 00:26:40.150
But we'll run you over...

00:26:40.275 --> 00:26:41.941
[BOTH] Like a kawasaki.

00:26:42.066 --> 00:26:43.233
Vroom vroom! [Laughs]

00:26:43.358 --> 00:26:44.150
Hey, baby

00:26:44.275 --> 00:26:45.441
Sofia... hey!

00:26:45.566 --> 00:26:46.400
Let me... let me...
Let me see the baby.

00:26:46.525 --> 00:26:47.941
Let me see the baby.

00:26:48.066 --> 00:26:50.650
Oh my gosh, look
what you've made!

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:51.525
Who's the father?

00:26:51.650 --> 00:26:52.650
Have you found him?

00:26:52.775 --> 00:26:56.650
[laughs] Sofia, ready, OK.

00:26:56.775 --> 00:26:58.650
Remember this?

00:26:58.775 --> 00:27:03.650
[BOTH] Let me tell you
what we are, W-I-N-N-E-R.

00:27:03.775 --> 00:27:04.608
That's it.

00:27:04.733 --> 00:27:06.025
Second half, second half.

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.900
[BOTH] Let me tell you
what you are, L-O-S-E-R!

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:12.733
That's great.

00:27:12.858 --> 00:27:16.150
And Riverside
Tigers out of sight.

00:27:16.275 --> 00:27:18.566
[BOTH] Riverside
Tigers dynamite.

00:27:18.691 --> 00:27:19.733
And that guy.

00:27:19.858 --> 00:27:21.066
Hang on, hang on.

00:27:21.191 --> 00:27:22.691
Explode!

00:27:22.816 --> 00:27:23.816
Explode.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.483
Explode!

00:27:25.608 --> 00:27:26.941
[laughs]

00:27:27.066 --> 00:27:28.358
Explode?

00:27:28.483 --> 00:27:30.316
Come on, you remember
our song, Chips Ahoyers.

00:27:30.441 --> 00:27:31.441
Come on, I got you.

00:27:31.525 --> 00:27:32.650
Ready?

00:27:32.775 --> 00:27:33.525
Ha.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.441
Explode!

00:27:34.566 --> 00:27:37.441
[applause]

00:27:39.983 --> 00:27:42.775
Oh yeah.

00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.358
I can't believe he
remembered all the moves.

00:27:45.483 --> 00:27:48.066
Oh yeah, he's a real champ.

00:27:48.191 --> 00:27:50.431
Bet he had a huge crush on
you in high school, didn't he?

00:27:50.525 --> 00:27:51.650
[laughs]

00:27:51.775 --> 00:27:56.400
Well, we did sort
of have sex once.

00:27:56.525 --> 00:27:58.733
What?

00:27:58.858 --> 00:28:01.058
I thought you said he was
paralyzed from the waist down.

00:28:01.108 --> 00:28:04.025
Well, not completely.

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:06.566
So, you just like forgot
to tell me about it.

00:28:06.691 --> 00:28:08.233
Sweetie it was a long time ago.

00:28:08.358 --> 00:28:10.376
I didn't want you thinking
about that when you met the guy.

00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.834
It's just... I don't
know, it's gross.

00:28:11.858 --> 00:28:14.191
I think you showed
really bad judgment.

00:28:14.316 --> 00:28:15.608
Why?

00:28:15.733 --> 00:28:18.816
Because no offense to
Chip, but he's a dick.

00:28:18.941 --> 00:28:22.358
You're not really
jealous, are you?

00:28:22.483 --> 00:28:26.650
Don't you know I'm saving
my special cheer for you?

00:28:26.775 --> 00:28:27.983
You have a special cheer?

00:28:28.108 --> 00:28:29.441
Yeah.

00:28:29.566 --> 00:28:31.400
Really?

00:28:31.525 --> 00:28:33.358
Can I see it?

00:28:33.483 --> 00:28:34.816
Show me upstairs.

00:28:34.941 --> 00:28:37.733
[door closes]

00:28:37.858 --> 00:28:40.191
Hi.

00:28:40.316 --> 00:28:42.900
Hello, Wesley.

00:28:43.025 --> 00:28:44.233
Can I get you anything?

00:28:44.358 --> 00:28:46.316
Hm, I'm all right.

00:28:46.441 --> 00:28:47.441
Got my twizzer.

00:28:50.066 --> 00:28:50.858
You got it?

00:28:50.983 --> 00:28:52.316
Yeah, I got it.

00:28:52.441 --> 00:28:54.108
[inaudible]

00:28:54.233 --> 00:28:56.775
So you, uh, spend any time at
your own house there, Wesley?

00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:01.400
Wesley's mom lives in New
Jersey, and his dad works late.

00:29:01.525 --> 00:29:02.900
Oh.

00:29:03.025 --> 00:29:05.775
Well I'm glad we could help out.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:07.733
Welcome to the family, Wesley.

00:29:07.858 --> 00:29:09.025
Thanks, Tom.

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:10.650
Hey, guys.

00:29:10.775 --> 00:29:13.358
You want to see
something really cool?

00:29:13.483 --> 00:29:14.483
Sure.

00:29:17.483 --> 00:29:18.483
SOFIA KOWALSKI: Oh.

00:29:21.233 --> 00:29:21.983
Oh.

00:29:22.108 --> 00:29:23.900
[laughs]

00:29:24.025 --> 00:29:25.858
Wesley, you're going
to hurt yourself.

00:29:25.983 --> 00:29:28.066
That was awesome.

00:29:28.191 --> 00:29:29.733
Wait a second, this is it.

00:29:30.775 --> 00:29:31.650
What are you doing?

00:29:31.775 --> 00:29:33.066
The Pickle Whip Campaign.

00:29:33.191 --> 00:29:36.275
This is how I'm going
to redeem myself.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.626
You got to promise me you're
never going to do that again.

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:40.316
Do that again.

00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:41.775
Nah, I don't feel so good.

00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:42.650
Oh come on, buddy.

00:29:42.775 --> 00:29:43.775
I need this for work.

00:29:43.816 --> 00:29:44.650
I don't know.

00:29:44.775 --> 00:29:45.775
I'll give you 20 bucks.

00:29:45.816 --> 00:29:47.025
Tom!

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:47.900
Done and done.

00:29:48.025 --> 00:29:50.858
[music playing]

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.191
There's my little Karate Kid.

00:29:56.316 --> 00:29:59.525
You know, Tom, when I told you
to meet me at the gym at 7:45,

00:29:59.650 --> 00:30:00.691
I didn't mean 47.

00:30:00.816 --> 00:30:02.025
I'm so sorry, Chip.

00:30:02.150 --> 00:30:03.709
Listen, I think I have
a really cool idea

00:30:03.733 --> 00:30:04.834
for the Pickle Whip Campaign.

00:30:04.858 --> 00:30:06.098
- Last night...
- you know what.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:07.626
First of all, I need
you to calm down.

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.191
I'm pretty calm.

00:30:09.316 --> 00:30:11.209
Great, we're going to start
by just painting the fence.

00:30:11.233 --> 00:30:12.816
You know what I mean?

00:30:12.941 --> 00:30:15.222
Because today is not for work
ideas, today is for bonding.

00:30:15.275 --> 00:30:17.525
We're going to exercise
together like men.

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:19.941
You know how to exercise
like a man, Tom?

00:30:20.066 --> 00:30:21.906
I'm guessing there won't
be any Pilates, right?

00:30:21.983 --> 00:30:23.650
[brakes screech]

00:30:23.775 --> 00:30:25.525
Of course there won't
be any Pilates, Tom.

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.358
I've got wheels for legs, OK?

00:30:27.483 --> 00:30:29.233
I can never do Pilates.

00:30:29.358 --> 00:30:31.678
No matter how super you and
your little sissy friends think

00:30:31.733 --> 00:30:33.150
it is.

00:30:33.275 --> 00:30:34.650
We're going to play basketball.

00:30:34.775 --> 00:30:35.775
You play basketball?

00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:36.900
That's right.

00:30:36.941 --> 00:30:38.400
Of course you do, all right.

00:30:38.525 --> 00:30:41.066
Well, we'll play basketball.

00:30:41.191 --> 00:30:42.358
Could you hold that for me?

00:30:42.483 --> 00:30:43.358
Thank you.

00:30:43.483 --> 00:30:44.816
[sighs]

00:30:44.941 --> 00:30:48.233
[chatter]

00:30:53.691 --> 00:30:54.691
Chip, no.

00:30:54.733 --> 00:30:56.108
Tom, yes.

00:30:56.233 --> 00:30:57.667
I already told the guys
you were going to join us.

00:30:57.691 --> 00:30:59.191
Come on, you're
going to love it.

00:30:59.316 --> 00:31:00.876
I don't feel comfortable
doing that, man, I'm sorry.

00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:01.900
Oh come on.

00:31:01.941 --> 00:31:03.233
What do you mean comfortable?

00:31:03.358 --> 00:31:04.792
We do this all the time
with able-bodied guys,

00:31:04.816 --> 00:31:06.691
you'll have fun.

00:31:06.816 --> 00:31:08.084
Well if they're
all cool with it.

00:31:08.108 --> 00:31:09.650
Absolutely they're cool with it.

00:31:09.775 --> 00:31:11.358
Are you cool with it?

00:31:11.483 --> 00:31:12.650
Are you down?

00:31:12.775 --> 00:31:14.691
Come on, get in
there and saddle up.

00:31:14.816 --> 00:31:17.136
The rules are basically the
same, except for the dribbling.

00:31:17.233 --> 00:31:18.775
OK?

00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.792
Player in possession of the
ball may not push his chair

00:31:20.816 --> 00:31:22.983
more than twice in
succession with one

00:31:23.108 --> 00:31:24.900
or both hands in
either direction

00:31:25.025 --> 00:31:27.358
without first tapping the
ball to the floor again.

00:31:27.483 --> 00:31:28.775
OK?

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:30.620
Basically two consecutive
pushes constitutes

00:31:30.733 --> 00:31:31.525
a traveling violation.

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:33.066
You got that, right?

00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:34.959
Oh and don't move your legs
at all during the game,

00:31:34.983 --> 00:31:36.858
the players consider
that poor etiquette.

00:31:36.983 --> 00:31:39.066
Fellas!

00:31:39.191 --> 00:31:41.358
Oh boy.

00:31:41.483 --> 00:31:43.441
CHIP SANDERS: Hello hello.

00:31:43.566 --> 00:31:45.066
All right, listen.

00:31:45.191 --> 00:31:46.733
I'm going to play with Eddie.

00:31:46.858 --> 00:31:48.316
New guy, you get the Colonel.

00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:49.983
Colonel?

00:31:50.108 --> 00:31:51.108
- You any good?
- No.

00:31:51.233 --> 00:31:52.733
- Can you shoot?
- No.

00:31:52.858 --> 00:31:54.316
- [inaudible]?
- Slow.

00:31:54.441 --> 00:31:55.525
Good at defense?

00:31:55.650 --> 00:31:57.650
I'm more of a
beginner, actually.

00:31:57.775 --> 00:31:58.816
I like you.

00:31:58.941 --> 00:31:59.691
Thank you.

00:31:59.816 --> 00:32:00.650
You're honest.

00:32:00.775 --> 00:32:02.400
I don't like fakers.

00:32:02.525 --> 00:32:04.941
I don't like fakers.

00:32:05.066 --> 00:32:06.525
Nobody likes a faker, sir.

00:32:06.650 --> 00:32:08.233
Just, uh, try your best.

00:32:08.358 --> 00:32:09.751
And by all means, keep your
hands in off the guard rails.

00:32:09.775 --> 00:32:11.608
Or else, somebody could
come along and smash!

00:32:11.733 --> 00:32:13.025
Ah!

00:32:13.150 --> 00:32:14.441
Game on, guys.

00:32:14.566 --> 00:32:16.358
Thought we're teammates?

00:32:16.483 --> 00:32:18.443
CHIP SANDERS: Hey bro, you
can't leave me up here!

00:32:18.483 --> 00:32:20.483
CHIP [VOICE OVER]:
Watch this, huh.

00:32:20.608 --> 00:32:21.626
Which way do you want me to go?

00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:22.483
No, this way.

00:32:22.608 --> 00:32:23.608
And that's a pick.

00:32:23.733 --> 00:32:24.775
Right back.

00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.525
Here comes a score.

00:32:26.650 --> 00:32:29.191
That's a little defensive, you
need to learn how to play, OK?

00:32:29.316 --> 00:32:30.066
Focus.

00:32:30.191 --> 00:32:31.025
[music playing]

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.400

00:32:35.941 --> 00:32:36.775
This way, buddy.

00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:40.108

00:32:43.108 --> 00:32:44.441
Ah!

00:32:44.566 --> 00:32:45.941
MAN 3: Sorry.

00:32:46.066 --> 00:32:49.400
[chatter]

00:32:51.983 --> 00:32:54.816
I'm open!

00:32:54.941 --> 00:32:55.941
Ah!

00:32:56.025 --> 00:32:57.025
What!

00:33:01.775 --> 00:33:02.975
MAN 4: That's going to happen.

00:33:05.483 --> 00:33:06.275
Get that thing in here.

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.400
Move it!

00:33:10.983 --> 00:33:12.150
OK, 10-10.

00:33:12.275 --> 00:33:13.358
Game point.

00:33:13.483 --> 00:33:14.650
Bring it.

00:33:14.775 --> 00:33:16.066
Ball's in.

00:33:16.191 --> 00:33:18.441
Right, work it back around.

00:33:18.566 --> 00:33:19.566
Here we go.

00:33:19.608 --> 00:33:20.900
Hey!

00:33:21.025 --> 00:33:21.816
You missed it!

00:33:21.941 --> 00:33:23.858
Back to me.

00:33:23.983 --> 00:33:25.108
This is what you want, pal.

00:33:25.233 --> 00:33:27.066
Hey!

00:33:27.191 --> 00:33:30.025
Shoot, kid!

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.025
[chatter]

00:33:33.775 --> 00:33:34.775
Ooh ooh.

00:33:40.941 --> 00:33:41.816
[laughs]

00:33:41.941 --> 00:33:43.691
In your face!

00:33:43.816 --> 00:33:45.025
MAN 5: Good job.

00:33:45.150 --> 00:33:46.566
Guys, his leg just moved.

00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:47.691
MAN 5: What?

00:33:47.733 --> 00:33:49.108
What are you talking about?

00:33:49.233 --> 00:33:50.400
MAN 5: Oh my gosh.

00:33:50.525 --> 00:33:52.316
You can walk?

00:33:52.441 --> 00:33:54.316
Uh, I think there
must be a little bit

00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:55.483
of a misunderstanding.

00:33:55.608 --> 00:33:56.608
Chip, can you?

00:34:01.150 --> 00:34:03.775
Ooh ooh, looks like trouble.

00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.150
[chatter]

00:34:06.275 --> 00:34:10.775
Moushiwake on the
whole mix-up thing, Tom.

00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.941
In my defense, I
was able to pry you

00:34:13.066 --> 00:34:15.025
from the Colonel's death
grip about five seconds

00:34:15.150 --> 00:34:16.275
after you blacked out.

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:17.983
Thank you so much, Chip.

00:34:18.108 --> 00:34:18.941
Don't you mention it.

00:34:19.066 --> 00:34:20.650
You're my dog.

00:34:20.775 --> 00:34:22.095
All right, let's
go take a shower.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:23.608
Did you bring your shampoo?

00:34:23.733 --> 00:34:27.358
No, uh... oh my god.

00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:28.775
Ah!

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:30.775
Careful.

00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:32.941
You want to put the towel
around your waist, or

00:34:33.066 --> 00:34:34.441
I'm all set.

00:34:34.566 --> 00:34:37.650
Now, Tom, didn't you want
to tell me a little idea

00:34:37.775 --> 00:34:40.316
for the Pickle Whip Campaign?

00:34:40.441 --> 00:34:42.066
No, I'm... I'm cool.

00:34:42.191 --> 00:34:44.167
Good, 'cause you're still real
new at the company, big guy.

00:34:44.191 --> 00:34:45.733
All right?

00:34:45.858 --> 00:34:47.126
You're a long ways from being
ready to pitch any ideas,

00:34:47.150 --> 00:34:48.816
let's not get ahead
of ourselves, OK?

00:34:48.941 --> 00:34:50.025
Fine.

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.733
And, Tom, it's
OK to look at him.

00:34:52.858 --> 00:34:53.858
He likes it.

00:34:53.983 --> 00:34:54.775
Don't ya?

00:34:54.900 --> 00:34:58.233
[music playing]

00:35:02.358 --> 00:35:03.358
Ow!

00:35:06.733 --> 00:35:10.608
You, uh, you hit my face.

00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:12.834
If you want to feel your
insignificance in the vastness

00:35:12.858 --> 00:35:16.025
of the universe, I
mean really feel it,

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.816
try boarding in the Himalayas.

00:35:18.941 --> 00:35:21.066
You, inspire me.

00:35:21.191 --> 00:35:22.431
Sorry about your face, brother.

00:35:25.066 --> 00:35:27.316
That's Don Wollebin.

00:35:27.441 --> 00:35:28.775
Oh.

00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:30.025
Power Pickle.

00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:32.066
He's Senor Tomato,
only less Mexican,

00:35:32.191 --> 00:35:34.483
and twice the attitude.

00:35:34.608 --> 00:35:37.566
Power Pickle loves
extreme skating,

00:35:37.691 --> 00:35:41.941
he loves extreme snowboarding,
also enjoys extreme skydiving.

00:35:42.066 --> 00:35:45.441
Most of all, he enjoys
extreme lunching.

00:35:45.566 --> 00:35:47.108
[laughs]

00:35:47.233 --> 00:35:48.025
That's good.

00:35:48.150 --> 00:35:49.775
It's phallic.

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.441
Oops.

00:35:51.566 --> 00:35:53.650
That feels like a commercial.

00:35:53.775 --> 00:35:54.816
Exactly.

00:35:54.941 --> 00:35:57.525
Nobody likes commercials.

00:35:57.650 --> 00:36:00.150
You know, that's true too.

00:36:00.275 --> 00:36:01.501
Well I have something
actually, uh...

00:36:01.525 --> 00:36:02.400
Who's this?

00:36:02.525 --> 00:36:04.275
Uh, uh, this is Tom Reilly.

00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.275
He's our new assistant
associate creative.

00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:09.400
Tom, it's... it's... it's...
Generally the creatives,

00:36:09.525 --> 00:36:13.983
or the associate creatives,
who make these proposals.

00:36:14.108 --> 00:36:19.400
It is better to listen to a
wise beggar than a rich fool.

00:36:19.525 --> 00:36:21.608
I want to hear the beggar.

00:36:21.733 --> 00:36:23.358
OK, thank you.

00:36:23.483 --> 00:36:27.441
I... I saw this kid do this kind
of funny trick the other day.

00:36:27.566 --> 00:36:30.816
And, I don't know, I think
it would make a hilarious ad.

00:36:30.941 --> 00:36:32.301
You... tell me what
you guys think.

00:36:37.525 --> 00:36:40.483
[laughter]

00:36:41.483 --> 00:36:44.400
No way!

00:36:44.525 --> 00:36:45.525
MAN 6: That's funny.

00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.983
Congratulations, Tom.
You did it.

00:36:52.108 --> 00:36:52.900
Oh.

00:36:53.025 --> 00:36:55.566
[applause]

00:36:57.233 --> 00:36:58.542
Tom, I want you going down
to Lion's Pride tomorrow

00:36:58.566 --> 00:36:59.876
to show this thing
to Jack Connor.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:00.650
Chip?

00:37:00.775 --> 00:37:01.900
Boss?

00:37:02.025 --> 00:37:03.042
You're Tom's
wing-man on this thing.

00:37:03.066 --> 00:37:06.691
Wing-man is.

00:37:06.816 --> 00:37:08.525
How about that?

00:37:08.650 --> 00:37:10.316
Do you mountain bike?

00:37:10.441 --> 00:37:11.858
Uh, yeah.

00:37:11.983 --> 00:37:13.501
I just... whenever I...
Whenever I get the chance

00:37:13.525 --> 00:37:15.292
I mean, there's some
amazing trails around here,

00:37:15.316 --> 00:37:16.441
especially at dawn.

00:37:16.566 --> 00:37:18.108
It's all inspiring.

00:37:18.233 --> 00:37:21.525
We should go sometime, hm?

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:22.441
Yeah.

00:37:22.566 --> 00:37:24.400
All right.

00:37:24.525 --> 00:37:25.608
Yeah, great.

00:37:25.733 --> 00:37:27.816
I got to get a bike.

00:37:27.941 --> 00:37:30.941
[guitar playing]

00:37:31.066 --> 00:37:32.876
TOM REILLY: Hey, I hope
there's no hard feelings 'cause

00:37:32.900 --> 00:37:34.941
I thought your
whole extreme pickle

00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:36.275
thing was... was really cool.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.459
When he was like,
you know, skydiving...

00:37:37.483 --> 00:37:39.066
Tom.

00:37:39.191 --> 00:37:42.525
Let me tell you something, if
you think I care about Power.

00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:43.983
Pickle, you're sorely mistaken.

00:37:44.108 --> 00:37:45.358
OK?

00:37:45.483 --> 00:37:46.959
I can think up ideas
like that in my sleep.

00:37:46.983 --> 00:37:49.233
And someday, when I'm
kicking ass in Barcelona,

00:37:49.358 --> 00:37:51.900
I'm going to look back
on this whole campaign

00:37:52.025 --> 00:37:58.483
as some sad,
pathetic, little joke.

00:37:58.608 --> 00:37:59.858
He said that?

00:37:59.983 --> 00:38:01.542
I have no idea what
he was talking about.

00:38:01.566 --> 00:38:04.233
There's this ad agency
in Barcelona called Idea.

00:38:04.358 --> 00:38:06.941
They're like cutting
edge euro geniuses.

00:38:07.066 --> 00:38:09.233
Chip applied for a job there.

00:38:09.358 --> 00:38:10.542
Nobody's supposed
to know about it

00:38:10.566 --> 00:38:12.691
but I saw him
mailing off a bunch

00:38:12.816 --> 00:38:14.650
of Senor Tomato figurines.

00:38:14.775 --> 00:38:16.400
That guy is out of his mind.

00:38:16.525 --> 00:38:18.691
Tell me about it.

00:38:18.816 --> 00:38:20.608
He is great in the sack though.

00:38:20.733 --> 00:38:21.858
How do you know?

00:38:21.983 --> 00:38:24.108
Nancy slept with
him last Christmas.

00:38:24.233 --> 00:38:27.358
She said it was the
best sex she ever had.

00:38:27.483 --> 00:38:30.275
Apparently he can like
balance on his arms,

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:31.941
and then the angle
makes it intense

00:38:32.066 --> 00:38:33.626
- because you're sitting...
- Yeah, I really

00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:34.970
I don't want to
hear about it, OK?

00:38:38.191 --> 00:38:40.066
What the hell?

00:38:40.191 --> 00:38:42.275
What?

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.275
Someone stole the
picture of my wife.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.691
[doorbell rings]

00:38:47.775 --> 00:38:49.566
Sofia Kowalski.

00:38:49.691 --> 00:38:50.691
Abby March, wow.

00:38:50.733 --> 00:38:51.566
Hey!

00:38:51.691 --> 00:38:53.441
It is so good to see you.

00:38:53.566 --> 00:38:54.816
And who is this little guy?

00:38:54.941 --> 00:38:57.108
This is Oliver.

00:38:57.233 --> 00:38:58.941
Petey?

00:38:59.066 --> 00:39:03.983
Petey, do you want
to give Oliver a hug?

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:04.900
Yeah?

00:39:05.025 --> 00:39:07.150
Oh, that's a big yes!

00:39:07.275 --> 00:39:08.025
Yes.

00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:09.650
Oh yes.

00:39:09.775 --> 00:39:13.441
Loves, oh, oh loves.

00:39:13.566 --> 00:39:14.650
Loves for your new friend.

00:39:14.775 --> 00:39:15.775
Oh.

00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:22.400
The akana as an a aids
indigestion, and helps

00:39:22.525 --> 00:39:24.941
with gas and constipation.

00:39:25.066 --> 00:39:27.108
Shall we ask permission?

00:39:27.233 --> 00:39:30.566
[chatter]

00:39:44.608 --> 00:39:46.900
Did you need some?

00:39:47.025 --> 00:39:48.066
Um?

00:39:48.191 --> 00:39:50.941
Its Bag Balm, and dairy farmers

00:39:51.066 --> 00:39:52.983
use it as a moisturizer
for cow udders.

00:39:53.108 --> 00:39:56.316
And it is the best thing in
the world for sore nipples.

00:39:56.441 --> 00:39:58.066
It's wonderful.

00:39:58.191 --> 00:39:59.316
Right.

00:39:59.441 --> 00:40:01.233
BOB KOWALSKI: Tom,
look at this lamp.

00:40:03.941 --> 00:40:07.316
Wollebin just gave this to me
to thank me for hiring you.

00:40:07.441 --> 00:40:08.650
Wow.

00:40:08.775 --> 00:40:11.608
You know, it hasn't
been exactly smooth

00:40:11.733 --> 00:40:14.025
for me since he took over.

00:40:14.150 --> 00:40:15.441
Hm.

00:40:15.566 --> 00:40:17.209
Anyway, I just wanted
to tell you that I think

00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:20.358
you're doing a great job, son.

00:40:20.483 --> 00:40:24.733
Well thank you, dad.

00:40:24.858 --> 00:40:27.400
Have you seen my whales?

00:40:27.525 --> 00:40:28.566
What?

00:40:28.691 --> 00:40:30.566
Have I showed you my whales?

00:40:30.691 --> 00:40:32.441
No.

00:40:32.566 --> 00:40:36.066
Sometimes I just sit in
here and stare at them.

00:40:36.191 --> 00:40:38.358
It's so peaceful.

00:40:38.483 --> 00:40:42.150
I even give them names.

00:40:42.275 --> 00:40:43.650
That one... ow fuck!

00:40:43.775 --> 00:40:44.775
Are you OK?

00:40:44.816 --> 00:40:46.400
That lamp is hotter than shit!

00:40:46.525 --> 00:40:49.900
[music playing]

00:41:02.608 --> 00:41:03.400
[baby crying]

00:41:03.525 --> 00:41:04.400
Shh.

00:41:04.525 --> 00:41:05.525
Come on, buddy.

00:41:05.566 --> 00:41:08.316
[baby crying]

00:41:14.566 --> 00:41:15.400
Hi.

00:41:15.525 --> 00:41:17.483
Hello, wife.

00:41:17.608 --> 00:41:20.191
Hello, child.

00:41:20.316 --> 00:41:21.316
Daddy's home.

00:41:21.358 --> 00:41:22.900
He's been like this all day.

00:41:23.025 --> 00:41:24.483
Oh no.

00:41:24.608 --> 00:41:27.358
What's wrong [inaudible] bear?

00:41:27.483 --> 00:41:28.775
Come here, little bear.

00:41:31.441 --> 00:41:34.941
Come on, you've
got to be kidding me.

00:41:35.066 --> 00:41:35.941
What's with the bike?

00:41:36.066 --> 00:41:37.441
TOM REILLY: It's hot, right?

00:41:37.566 --> 00:41:39.525
Wollebin asked me to go
mountain biking with him.

00:41:39.650 --> 00:41:42.025
He asked me right after
he put me in charge

00:41:42.150 --> 00:41:44.150
of the Pickle Whip Campaign.

00:41:44.275 --> 00:41:45.150
$1,200?

00:41:45.275 --> 00:41:46.316
Oh, babe, a b...

00:41:46.441 --> 00:41:48.691
A bike like that
should cost 1,500.

00:41:48.816 --> 00:41:49.917
Try and bend those rims, try.

00:41:49.941 --> 00:41:51.025
Kick them.

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:52.167
You can't bend
those rims, they're

00:41:52.191 --> 00:41:53.775
called high performance rims.

00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.275
Honey, you've never been
mountain biking in your life.

00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.501
Look, if you want me to return
the bike, I'll return the bike.

00:41:58.525 --> 00:41:59.667
I want you to return the bike.

00:41:59.691 --> 00:42:00.858
You know what?

00:42:00.983 --> 00:42:02.334
No, I'm not going
to return the bike.

00:42:02.358 --> 00:42:04.525
Because I think physical
fitness is important

00:42:04.650 --> 00:42:06.983
and I think it's
good for my career.

00:42:07.108 --> 00:42:08.983
My day was terrible.

00:42:09.108 --> 00:42:10.983
This girl I hated in
high school came over

00:42:11.108 --> 00:42:12.941
and made me go to her
baby group and everyone

00:42:13.066 --> 00:42:14.566
called me a bad mommy.

00:42:14.691 --> 00:42:16.691
You're an amazing mommy.

00:42:16.816 --> 00:42:19.900
Daddy gets the go mountain
biking with Wollebin.

00:42:20.025 --> 00:42:21.400
Chip can't go mountain biking.

00:42:21.525 --> 00:42:23.483
Tom.

00:42:23.608 --> 00:42:25.566
It was a joke.

00:42:25.691 --> 00:42:28.108
I don't think making fun of
people's handicap is funny.

00:42:28.233 --> 00:42:29.233
It was a joke.

00:42:34.983 --> 00:42:36.900
Asleep in under five minutes.

00:42:37.025 --> 00:42:39.025
Daddy's got the magic touch.

00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:42.108
So what does Wesley get out
of this whole Pickle Whip thing?

00:42:42.233 --> 00:42:43.501
I already got him
to sign a release.

00:42:43.525 --> 00:42:47.608
He gets $1,000 if the ad airs.

00:42:47.733 --> 00:42:48.983
What you doing?

00:42:49.108 --> 00:42:50.441
It's Bag Balm, Tom.

00:42:50.566 --> 00:42:53.316
These are for cow's udders.

00:42:53.441 --> 00:42:54.525
Rub on udders.

00:42:54.650 --> 00:42:55.441
Wow.

00:42:55.566 --> 00:42:57.150
I don't know, sweetie.

00:42:57.275 --> 00:42:58.501
It just feels like the whole
thing's a little exploitative

00:42:58.525 --> 00:42:59.816
of Wesley.

00:42:59.941 --> 00:43:01.275
Oh, I get it.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:03.775
I think I see what's happening.

00:43:03.900 --> 00:43:05.691
Somebody's a little jealous.

00:43:05.816 --> 00:43:06.941
What?

00:43:07.066 --> 00:43:08.275
Oh come on.

00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.000
You're used to being
the star and now I'm

00:43:10.025 --> 00:43:11.275
in the limelight a little bit.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.525
It's probably driving
you crazy, admit it.

00:43:14.650 --> 00:43:15.650
Admit it.

00:43:27.441 --> 00:43:28.441
Score a touchdown...

00:43:28.483 --> 00:43:29.683
It's not going to happen, Tom.

00:43:35.816 --> 00:43:36.816
Use the Bag Balm.

00:43:40.108 --> 00:43:41.748
CHIP SANDERS: Jack,
good to see you again.

00:43:41.775 --> 00:43:42.816
How are you?

00:43:42.941 --> 00:43:44.167
Please meet Tom
Reilly, he's been

00:43:44.191 --> 00:43:45.650
helping me out on the campaign.

00:43:45.775 --> 00:43:47.066
Riley, is it?

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:49.691
Do you have Irish blood
in you, by any chance?

00:43:49.816 --> 00:43:51.650
Me father's father
was an Irishman.

00:43:51.775 --> 00:43:53.650
So I have a wee bit
of the leprechaunry.

00:43:56.525 --> 00:43:57.525
Are you making fun of me?

00:44:01.233 --> 00:44:02.483
No I'm... I'm sorry.

00:44:02.608 --> 00:44:07.441
I... I... I thought that
was a fake accent.

00:44:07.566 --> 00:44:08.650
Why?

00:44:08.775 --> 00:44:09.566
I don't know.

00:44:09.691 --> 00:44:13.108
I... I... I don't know.

00:44:13.233 --> 00:44:14.525
Well that was unfortunate.

00:44:14.650 --> 00:44:16.042
Jack, you're going to
love the new campaign.

00:44:16.066 --> 00:44:17.066
Let's jump right in.

00:44:24.775 --> 00:44:28.108
[laughter]

00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:30.816
I mean, is that something?

00:44:30.941 --> 00:44:32.608
Is that incredible or what?

00:44:32.733 --> 00:44:35.941
When I saw that kid,
I said that's it.

00:44:36.066 --> 00:44:38.306
We've all just said hello to
the new face of Pickle Whip.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.691
Well done, Chip.

00:44:39.816 --> 00:44:41.650
Thanks so much, Jack.

00:44:41.775 --> 00:44:44.483
I'm so sorry, but you're going
to all have to excuse me.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:49.608
Jack, [whispers]

00:44:49.733 --> 00:44:51.358
Oh, certainly, of course.

00:44:51.483 --> 00:44:52.941
Great.

00:44:53.066 --> 00:44:55.983
And Tom, do us a favor
please, and present the market

00:44:56.108 --> 00:44:57.400
penetration strategy.

00:45:00.275 --> 00:45:02.691
Market penetration strategy.

00:45:02.816 --> 00:45:07.525
Something that's very important
to today's youth market.

00:45:07.650 --> 00:45:09.941
Penetration.

00:45:10.066 --> 00:45:14.358
Um, let's stick with long range,
because that way we know we're

00:45:14.483 --> 00:45:18.150
going to maximize P, profit.

00:45:18.275 --> 00:45:20.525
Isn't p price?

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:23.566
You're thinking of upper
case, this is a lower case.

00:45:23.691 --> 00:45:27.025
P. Write that down, here we go.

00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.025
Next slide.

00:45:28.150 --> 00:45:29.983
[chatter]

00:45:31.608 --> 00:45:35.233
That's just J and Q. There
they are, next slide.

00:45:35.358 --> 00:45:39.191
Have you talked to Chris
about the penetration strategy?

00:45:39.316 --> 00:45:40.400
Chris?

00:45:40.525 --> 00:45:41.566
Chris Caldwell.

00:45:41.691 --> 00:45:44.233
Your director of
market research.

00:45:44.358 --> 00:45:46.900
Oh, Chris Chris.

00:45:47.025 --> 00:45:48.941
Chris Chris, yes.

00:45:49.066 --> 00:45:51.441
I talked to him this
morning, he loves it.

00:45:51.566 --> 00:45:55.691
Chris Caldwell is a woman.

00:45:55.816 --> 00:45:57.441
Yes.

00:45:57.566 --> 00:45:59.483
Why did you say he?

00:45:59.608 --> 00:46:02.275
It's a little joke we have.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:10.400
Everybody calls Chris a he
because she looks like a man.

00:46:10.941 --> 00:46:13.191
She had a little mustache.

00:46:13.316 --> 00:46:16.858
But it's gone, she...
She... she waxed it.

00:46:16.983 --> 00:46:18.566
She looks great.

00:46:18.691 --> 00:46:21.191
If you guys see her, you got
to tell her how good she looks.

00:46:21.316 --> 00:46:23.816
Because we're all...
We're all proud of her.

00:46:33.108 --> 00:46:34.691
Tom?

00:46:34.816 --> 00:46:36.792
Sorry I had to duck out, how'd
the rest of the meeting go?

00:46:36.816 --> 00:46:38.001
How do you think it went, Chip?

00:46:38.025 --> 00:46:39.775
You left me high
and dry in there.

00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.358
I'm sorry, I had
a medical emergency.

00:46:41.483 --> 00:46:42.275
Yeah right.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.525
What kind of emergency?

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:46.376
Well I don't really enjoy
talking about it in front

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.840
of other people,
but if you must know

00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:50.358
I sometimes have a bladder
control problem, OK?

00:46:50.483 --> 00:46:52.376
It's very embarrassing but
it is one of the things

00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.876
that you have to
deal with when you're

00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:55.150
paralyzed from the waist down.

00:46:59.275 --> 00:47:02.650
[music playing]

00:47:05.275 --> 00:47:08.608
[indistinct voices]

00:48:02.525 --> 00:48:04.483
BOB KOWALSKI: A toast.

00:48:04.608 --> 00:48:08.316
You know, Tom, to be honest
for a long time Amelia

00:48:08.441 --> 00:48:11.066
and I have been wondering
how long it's going to take

00:48:11.191 --> 00:48:12.292
you to get your act together.

00:48:12.316 --> 00:48:13.108
Bob!

00:48:13.233 --> 00:48:16.191
Amelia, please!

00:48:16.316 --> 00:48:21.733
It's taken you awhile, but you
finally realized who you are.

00:48:21.858 --> 00:48:24.275
You're an ad man.

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:25.400
To Tom Reilly.

00:48:32.316 --> 00:48:34.066
Ad man.

00:48:34.191 --> 00:48:36.108
TOM REILLY: You look
up to me now, buddy.

00:48:36.233 --> 00:48:38.400
But when you get a
little bit older,

00:48:38.525 --> 00:48:41.900
you're going to realize
that your dad has absolutely

00:48:42.025 --> 00:48:43.775
no idea what he's doing.

00:48:43.900 --> 00:48:47.025
[baby sounds]

00:48:48.941 --> 00:48:50.261
I don't want to
go back out there.

00:48:52.858 --> 00:48:55.650
I don't want to go back out
there, so how about you and me,

00:48:55.775 --> 00:48:57.566
we're just going to
sit in here until you

00:48:57.691 --> 00:48:58.941
crap your pants again.

00:48:59.066 --> 00:49:00.066
OK?

00:49:02.775 --> 00:49:04.983
Are you OK?

00:49:05.108 --> 00:49:06.400
Yeah, why?

00:49:06.525 --> 00:49:08.566
Chip said and you
blew up at him today.

00:49:08.691 --> 00:49:09.483
What?

00:49:09.608 --> 00:49:10.983
He called you?

00:49:11.108 --> 00:49:12.334
He called me because
he was worried about you.

00:49:12.358 --> 00:49:13.917
He said you were
acting kind of hostile.

00:49:13.941 --> 00:49:14.941
I'm acting hostile?

00:49:17.858 --> 00:49:19.691
Oh my god that son of a bitch.

00:49:26.150 --> 00:49:28.691
Jack Connor tore me a
new asshole this morning.

00:49:28.816 --> 00:49:30.525
What the hell is
the matter with you?

00:49:30.650 --> 00:49:31.691
Bob, moushiwake, OK?

00:49:31.816 --> 00:49:33.066
But Chip hung me out to dry.

00:49:33.191 --> 00:49:34.941
Jack said that you
made fun of his mother

00:49:35.066 --> 00:49:35.858
for having a mustache.

00:49:35.983 --> 00:49:37.108
That's not true.

00:49:37.233 --> 00:49:38.673
I said Chris Caldwell
had a mustache.

00:49:38.733 --> 00:49:40.316
Chris Caldwell
doesn't have a mustache!

00:49:40.441 --> 00:49:41.841
I know, but I
thought Chris Caldwell

00:49:41.900 --> 00:49:44.150
was a man because Chris
is often a man's name.

00:49:46.775 --> 00:49:48.525
Three creatives came
to me this morning

00:49:48.650 --> 00:49:50.191
and said that you
were humiliating.

00:49:50.316 --> 00:49:51.650
Chip about his disability!

00:49:51.775 --> 00:49:53.316
Chip is trying to sabotage me!

00:49:53.441 --> 00:49:54.691
Chip was trying to mentor you!

00:49:54.816 --> 00:49:57.025
He came to me and said,
how can I help him?

00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.983
Don't you see?

00:49:58.108 --> 00:49:59.608
That's part of his plan!

00:49:59.733 --> 00:50:01.900
He's like a... he's like a
mind game genius, that guy!

00:50:02.025 --> 00:50:05.191
You know, you may not care
that I put my job on the line

00:50:05.316 --> 00:50:06.691
to get you hired.

00:50:06.816 --> 00:50:08.983
But you moved your family
1,000 miles for this,

00:50:09.108 --> 00:50:12.191
you've got to pull
yourself together!

00:50:12.316 --> 00:50:14.525
Just washing our hands.

00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:16.275
Yeah, I just put
him down for a nap.

00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.876
I'm desperate for a
little grown-up talk.

00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.233
Did de Palma come back to you?

00:50:19.358 --> 00:50:20.983
Yeah, yeah, yeah
we got a court date.

00:50:21.108 --> 00:50:23.066
No... no no the other file no.

00:50:23.191 --> 00:50:24.983
Honey, I'm so sorry
it's crazy here.

00:50:25.108 --> 00:50:25.858
Can I call you later?

00:50:25.983 --> 00:50:26.983
Sure.

00:50:36.816 --> 00:50:38.191
Hey, Tom.

00:50:38.316 --> 00:50:39.316
Wait up.

00:50:39.358 --> 00:50:40.376
Sorry about that back there.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.400
Rough times, huh?

00:50:41.441 --> 00:50:43.025
Yeah.

00:50:43.150 --> 00:50:44.334
Hey, looks like someone could
use a good listener, buddy.

00:50:44.358 --> 00:50:45.733
Huh?

00:50:45.858 --> 00:50:47.816
I just don't think I fit
into this place, Manny.

00:50:47.941 --> 00:50:49.400
Oof, I've been there, man.

00:50:49.525 --> 00:50:50.358
You?

00:50:50.483 --> 00:50:51.358
You are Sunburst!

00:50:51.483 --> 00:50:52.275
What are you talking about?

00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.400
Oh you think so, huh?

00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:01.525
The second I bought
this little guy,

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:02.959
made me feel a
whole lot more him.

00:51:02.983 --> 00:51:03.983
- OK.
- Want to try it on?

00:51:04.025 --> 00:51:05.275
No no.

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:07.233
Why don't you keep it?
'Cause that's yours.

00:51:07.358 --> 00:51:09.566
It's not really a
hipness thing, I just

00:51:09.691 --> 00:51:11.171
I'm not getting along
with Chip at all

00:51:11.233 --> 00:51:12.417
and that's really
starting to mess up

00:51:12.441 --> 00:51:14.816
my relationship with my wife.

00:51:14.941 --> 00:51:16.858
Well, I think
today's your lucky day.

00:51:16.983 --> 00:51:19.025
I'm studying to be a
marriage counselor.

00:51:19.150 --> 00:51:20.150
Really?

00:51:20.191 --> 00:51:21.441
Yeah.

00:51:21.566 --> 00:51:23.286
I thought it'd be a
great way to meet women.

00:51:23.316 --> 00:51:24.400
And men.

00:51:24.525 --> 00:51:25.608
Oh, wow.

00:51:25.733 --> 00:51:27.126
Guess that increases
your odds, huh?

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.709
Yeah, you know, I like
having sex with women.

00:51:28.733 --> 00:51:31.275
But men are better cuddlers,
you know what I mean?

00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.691
Sure, sure I do.

00:51:33.816 --> 00:51:36.358
Well, at this point, Manny,
I would try anything.

00:51:36.483 --> 00:51:38.084
I love my wife so much
but I don't even know

00:51:38.108 --> 00:51:39.233
how to talk to her anymore.

00:51:39.358 --> 00:51:40.608
You know?

00:51:40.733 --> 00:51:41.917
How am I supposed to
tell her I'm miserable

00:51:41.941 --> 00:51:42.941
when she's so happy here?

00:51:43.025 --> 00:51:46.316
[laughter]

00:51:54.233 --> 00:51:56.608
Sofia, remember
that the laughter

00:51:56.733 --> 00:52:01.983
starts deep within and then just
comes ro... ro... rolling out.

00:52:02.108 --> 00:52:03.691
Ha ha ha.

00:52:03.816 --> 00:52:09.358
Yeah, I really only laugh
when something funny happens.

00:52:09.483 --> 00:52:12.525
I've noticed that
Oliver isn't very happy.

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:14.025
He never smiles.

00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:15.858
He smiles all the time.

00:52:15.983 --> 00:52:19.483
He's... he just isn't
smiling right now.

00:52:19.608 --> 00:52:21.691
Now you're not going
to like this, Sofia.

00:52:21.816 --> 00:52:24.483
But you are a very
unhappy person

00:52:24.608 --> 00:52:27.275
and I don't think
it's good for Oliver.

00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:28.876
You're not going to
like this either, Abby,

00:52:28.900 --> 00:52:30.400
but you're an idiot.

00:52:30.525 --> 00:52:34.191
And your son,
Petey, is a dipshit.

00:52:34.316 --> 00:52:35.650
It's OK.

00:52:35.775 --> 00:52:37.608
[baby crying]

00:52:37.733 --> 00:52:38.733
I know, sweetie.

00:52:38.775 --> 00:52:40.983
Here, it's Professor Polar Bear.

00:52:41.108 --> 00:52:42.608
It's Professor Polar Bear.

00:52:42.733 --> 00:52:44.358
It's Professor Polar Bear.

00:52:44.483 --> 00:52:47.858
[horn honks]

00:52:49.441 --> 00:52:52.816
[baby crying]

00:52:55.441 --> 00:52:59.025
Let's start by taking
a nice, deep breath.

00:52:59.150 --> 00:53:00.858
Just relax.

00:53:00.983 --> 00:53:01.775
OK?

00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:04.400
[phone rings]

00:53:04.525 --> 00:53:06.483
Mom!

00:53:06.608 --> 00:53:08.316
Mom answer the phone!

00:53:08.441 --> 00:53:10.733
So sorry.

00:53:10.858 --> 00:53:12.483
Mom!

00:53:12.608 --> 00:53:14.459
Answer the phone and don't come
down here I'm having a session!

00:53:14.483 --> 00:53:17.066
[phone rings]

00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.720
Many of the exercises
I'm studying

00:53:19.816 --> 00:53:21.983
are a little new agey
so I hope you guys will

00:53:22.108 --> 00:53:23.650
just trust me and roll with it.

00:53:23.775 --> 00:53:24.566
Sure.

00:53:24.691 --> 00:53:25.525
Sure, mate.

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:26.941
Great.

00:53:27.066 --> 00:53:30.025
Let's start by holding
each other's genitals.

00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:31.316
OK, I'm leaving.

00:53:31.441 --> 00:53:32.501
No, not... not holding, poking.

00:53:32.525 --> 00:53:33.775
No you're not poking anything.

00:53:33.900 --> 00:53:34.691
Babe, he's kidding.

00:53:34.816 --> 00:53:35.608
Tell me you're kidding?

00:53:35.733 --> 00:53:36.941
I'm kidding.

00:53:37.066 --> 00:53:38.650
Sort of lighten the
mood, that's all.

00:53:38.775 --> 00:53:40.501
- Lightening the mood, come on.
- That's all that is.

00:53:40.525 --> 00:53:41.608
OK, you know what?

00:53:41.733 --> 00:53:44.108
Don't sit down, I've
got an exercise.

00:53:44.233 --> 00:53:47.191
This is called I'm upset bat.

00:53:47.316 --> 00:53:50.025
It's a great way to get to
the root of hurt feelings.

00:53:50.150 --> 00:53:51.900
You'll each complete
the sentence,

00:53:52.025 --> 00:53:55.566
I'm upset that, and then
tap each other with the bat.

00:53:55.691 --> 00:53:56.900
OK?

00:53:57.025 --> 00:53:59.066
Now, Sofia, you go first.

00:53:59.191 --> 00:54:05.441
Um, I'm upset that you
bought that mountain bike.

00:54:05.566 --> 00:54:07.358
Now tap him.

00:54:07.483 --> 00:54:08.275
Good.

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.858
Tom.

00:54:09.983 --> 00:54:14.983
Oh I'm upset that we haven't
had sex in a long time.

00:54:17.775 --> 00:54:19.335
I'm upset that you
didn't get the chance

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.167
to have an eight-pound baby
shoot out of your vagina.

00:54:21.191 --> 00:54:23.108
Maybe then you'd understand!

00:54:23.233 --> 00:54:23.983
Good!

00:54:24.108 --> 00:54:25.441
That's great.

00:54:25.566 --> 00:54:27.941
I'm upset that you banged Chip!

00:54:28.066 --> 00:54:29.233
- You banged Chip?
- No.

00:54:29.358 --> 00:54:30.650
Yes!

00:54:30.775 --> 00:54:33.108
I'm upset that you just
told him I banged Chip!

00:54:33.233 --> 00:54:34.525
Ow!

00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:36.450
You're not supposed to
hit people in the face.

00:54:38.858 --> 00:54:40.816
I'm upset that you
talked me into coming here.

00:54:40.941 --> 00:54:43.483
Don't hit me anymore, please.

00:54:43.608 --> 00:54:44.650
Please don't hit me more.

00:54:55.608 --> 00:54:58.900
[laughter]

00:55:01.483 --> 00:55:02.691
No, that was helpful.

00:55:02.816 --> 00:55:04.042
Well look what I
grabbed on the way out.

00:55:04.066 --> 00:55:07.233
[laughter]

00:55:07.358 --> 00:55:08.441
I love you so much.

00:55:08.566 --> 00:55:09.775
I love you too.

00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:11.316
But, are you happy?

00:55:14.483 --> 00:55:17.025
You can tell me.

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:18.275
I...

00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.441
Wait, that might
be the babysitter.

00:55:20.566 --> 00:55:21.691
Hello?

00:55:21.816 --> 00:55:24.025
So I'm looking
through the 1989 Tigers.

00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:26.066
Paw and I see a
picture of a very

00:55:26.191 --> 00:55:28.025
pretty girl in a Yaz t-shirt.

00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:29.691
Yeah, you know what?

00:55:29.816 --> 00:55:31.751
I can't really talk right now,
can I call you back later?

00:55:31.775 --> 00:55:36.150
Chip which, thanks for making
the last four years so awesome.

00:55:36.275 --> 00:55:39.900
Too cool to be forgotten.

00:55:40.025 --> 00:55:42.042
Boy, those words have gotten
me through some pretty tough

00:55:42.066 --> 00:55:43.066
times.

00:55:44.900 --> 00:55:47.483
[chatter]

00:56:04.358 --> 00:56:06.733
I got you.

00:56:06.858 --> 00:56:10.191
[mumbling]

00:56:26.525 --> 00:56:28.066
Tom.

00:56:28.191 --> 00:56:32.108
Tom is a man with vision and
I want him in that meeting.

00:56:32.233 --> 00:56:34.775
Take this down to video tech
first thing in the morning.

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.275
I want them to put the tag
on it, and then make dubs.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.275
Dubs, OK.

00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:39.400
Bye.

00:56:42.816 --> 00:56:46.191
[whale sounds]

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:54.150
Careful.

00:56:54.275 --> 00:56:57.650
[music playing]

00:57:27.816 --> 00:57:28.608
TOM REILLY: Hey!

00:57:28.733 --> 00:57:30.066
Hey, buddy!

00:57:30.191 --> 00:57:31.900
There's something
that I wanted to see!

00:57:32.025 --> 00:57:34.941
We're going to do that cool
hamburger trick again, buddy.

00:57:35.066 --> 00:57:36.316
I can't.

00:57:36.441 --> 00:57:37.584
What are you talking
about, sure you can.

00:57:37.608 --> 00:57:38.900
I don't eat meat anymore.

00:57:39.025 --> 00:57:40.483
What?

00:57:40.608 --> 00:57:42.126
I saw this show yesterday
about how they made meat.

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:43.900
It's all about killing animals.

00:57:44.025 --> 00:57:46.025
You became a
vegetarian yesterday?

00:57:46.150 --> 00:57:47.233
Yeah, so what?

00:57:47.358 --> 00:57:48.398
All right, cool, whatever.

00:57:48.483 --> 00:57:49.691
We'll get you a veggie burger.

00:57:49.816 --> 00:57:50.983
Nah.

00:57:51.108 --> 00:57:53.900
Wesley, you'll get to be famous!

00:57:54.025 --> 00:57:56.566
Like Harry Potter or Urkel.

00:57:56.691 --> 00:57:58.733
Tom, it's not going to happen.

00:57:58.858 --> 00:58:00.316
End of discussion.

00:58:00.441 --> 00:58:02.233
Don't be an idiot, Wesley.

00:58:02.358 --> 00:58:03.733
That's mine!

00:58:03.858 --> 00:58:06.608
Now you'll get it back
when you eat a hamburger.

00:58:06.733 --> 00:58:07.733
Hey! Come here!

00:58:07.775 --> 00:58:08.525
Help!

00:58:08.650 --> 00:58:09.483
Wesley!

00:58:09.608 --> 00:58:10.608
Wesley!

00:58:10.650 --> 00:58:11.650
Wesley!

00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:16.650
Wesley!

00:58:16.775 --> 00:58:18.150
I'm not done talking to you!

00:58:18.275 --> 00:58:21.400
Can I help you?

00:58:21.525 --> 00:58:23.983
Hey.

00:58:24.108 --> 00:58:26.941
I just moved in next door.

00:58:27.066 --> 00:58:28.150
Nice to meet you.

00:58:28.275 --> 00:58:29.635
Just talking to
Wesley, he's great.

00:58:38.066 --> 00:58:39.941
SOFIA KOWALSKI: Tom?

00:58:40.066 --> 00:58:42.400
Yeah?

00:58:42.525 --> 00:58:44.608
Were you just yelling at Wesley?

00:58:44.733 --> 00:58:46.084
I need you to talk
to that kid, Sophia.

00:58:46.108 --> 00:58:47.691
His priorities are
way out of line.

00:58:47.816 --> 00:58:49.191
What are you talking about?

00:58:49.316 --> 00:58:51.358
I accidentally taped
over the video of Wesley.

00:58:51.483 --> 00:58:53.108
We got to get him to
eat another burger.

00:58:53.233 --> 00:58:55.650
Honey, if he doesn't want to
do it just find somebody else.

00:58:55.775 --> 00:58:58.025
Sure, honey, I'll just
get one of the other kids

00:58:58.150 --> 00:59:00.275
on the block who can swallow
a hamburger in one bite.

00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.608
I'm sure there's not a
gag reflex on the block!

00:59:02.733 --> 00:59:04.400
OK you've got to calm down.

00:59:04.525 --> 00:59:05.608
You're acting crazy.

00:59:05.733 --> 00:59:06.566
I'm acting crazy?

00:59:06.691 --> 00:59:07.441
That little twerp...

00:59:07.566 --> 00:59:09.858
[knocking]

00:59:09.983 --> 00:59:10.983
Could you get that?

00:59:15.275 --> 00:59:16.566
Hi.

00:59:16.691 --> 00:59:19.066
I believe your husband
has my son's skateboard.

00:59:23.566 --> 00:59:26.858
[chatter]

00:59:33.816 --> 00:59:36.775
MAN 6: Let's open up
some windows over there.

00:59:36.900 --> 00:59:39.233
Tom, you are not
going to believe this.

00:59:39.358 --> 00:59:43.150
Bob left the Wesley tape
on his desk and we lost it.

00:59:43.275 --> 00:59:44.650
No shoes on the prayer mat!

00:59:44.775 --> 00:59:46.316
We found the culprit.

00:59:46.441 --> 00:59:49.566
Somebody left the bulb
touching a stack of paper.

00:59:49.691 --> 00:59:51.316
Dammit!

00:59:51.441 --> 00:59:52.983
Jesus Christ, Bob.

00:59:53.108 --> 00:59:54.525
It's just an accident.

00:59:54.650 --> 00:59:57.400
No no no, it's been a
series of mistakes, Tom.

00:59:57.525 --> 00:59:59.650
Earlier this week he
cost us a major account.

00:59:59.775 --> 01:00:01.941
Could have been the
next Smith and Hawkin.

01:00:02.066 --> 01:00:03.608
Don I can fix this.

01:00:03.733 --> 01:00:05.025
I can fix it.

01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:07.900
All I got to do is get
Wesley on tape again.

01:00:08.025 --> 01:00:09.566
Trust me, I can fix it.

01:00:14.483 --> 01:00:15.983
Go for help, now.

01:00:16.108 --> 01:00:18.566
Go!

01:00:18.691 --> 01:00:20.650
TOM REILLY: I'm not going
to hurt you, Wesley.

01:00:20.775 --> 01:00:22.900
I just want to talk to you.

01:00:23.025 --> 01:00:27.525
Look what I got, $1,000 from
my very own bank account.

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:29.191
Huh? For you!

01:00:29.316 --> 01:00:30.525
What do you say?

01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:32.858
My lawyer said I
can't talk to you, dude.

01:00:32.983 --> 01:00:34.150
- Your lawyer?
- Hey!

01:00:34.275 --> 01:00:35.316
Get away from the kids!

01:00:35.441 --> 01:00:36.441
Get away from the kids!

01:00:36.483 --> 01:00:37.275
I'm just talking...

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.733
Ah!

01:00:39.858 --> 01:00:40.691
Ah!

01:00:40.816 --> 01:00:41.816
Are you crazy?

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.900
Ah!

01:00:47.191 --> 01:00:51.025
[indistinct voice]

01:00:51.150 --> 01:00:53.025
I will.

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:54.441
Wait, mom, Tom just got home.

01:00:54.566 --> 01:00:56.983
Let me... let me
call you right back.

01:00:57.108 --> 01:00:58.650
My dad got fired.

01:00:58.775 --> 01:01:01.358
What?

01:01:01.483 --> 01:01:02.483
I told him to wait.

01:01:02.525 --> 01:01:03.775
I was going to fix everything.

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.441
He got blamed for...
For some kind of fire?

01:01:06.566 --> 01:01:08.816
Oh my god, it's not about that.

01:01:08.941 --> 01:01:12.108
You see the Wesley video got
destroyed in the fire, so...

01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:14.233
The Wesley video?

01:01:14.358 --> 01:01:16.025
What?

01:01:16.150 --> 01:01:19.775
Well you told me you
taped over the Wesley video.

01:01:19.900 --> 01:01:21.066
I know.

01:01:21.191 --> 01:01:22.417
And what I'm trying
to explain to you

01:01:22.441 --> 01:01:24.233
is that it wasn't one thing.

01:01:24.358 --> 01:01:25.838
But Wollebin knows
that the tape thing

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.233
wasn't my dad's fault, right?

01:01:27.358 --> 01:01:29.400
Sofia, it's a very
complicated situation.

01:01:29.525 --> 01:01:30.685
Well did you tell him or not?

01:01:30.775 --> 01:01:31.900
Yes or no?

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:33.733
It wouldn't have
made a difference!

01:01:33.858 --> 01:01:35.025
I don't believe you.

01:01:35.150 --> 01:01:36.608
You know what, Sofia?

01:01:36.733 --> 01:01:38.173
If you'd helped me
get Wesley to redo

01:01:38.275 --> 01:01:39.876
the video instead of taking
his side, none of this

01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:40.650
would have happened.

01:01:40.775 --> 01:01:41.983
Are you insane?

01:01:42.108 --> 01:01:43.626
Your dad was going
to get fired anyway.

01:01:43.650 --> 01:01:45.610
What do you want me to
volunteer to get fired too?

01:01:45.650 --> 01:01:47.233
I tried to fix it,
it didn't work.

01:01:47.358 --> 01:01:49.191
I'm sorry.

01:01:49.316 --> 01:01:51.400
I'm doing all of
this for you, Sophia.

01:01:51.525 --> 01:01:53.191
Everything! You have it so easy!

01:01:53.316 --> 01:01:54.626
You get to hang out
with Oliver all day!

01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:56.316
You think I like what I'm doing?

01:01:56.441 --> 01:01:57.542
You think I like
that stupid job?

01:01:57.566 --> 01:01:58.400
I hate it!

01:01:58.525 --> 01:01:59.858
I am completely miserable!

01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:06.900
Sofia.

01:02:07.025 --> 01:02:07.900
SOFIA KOWALSKI: I'm
going to my parents.

01:02:08.025 --> 01:02:09.105
Call me when you calm down.

01:02:22.233 --> 01:02:25.608
[music playing]

01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:45.400
Sweet ride, Tom.

01:02:45.525 --> 01:02:47.358
I thought this thing
was a Poon magnet.

01:02:47.483 --> 01:02:49.191
What the hell are
you doing here, Chip?

01:02:49.316 --> 01:02:50.542
I was just in the neighborhood.

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:52.858
Did I see Sofia leaving
with a suitcase?

01:02:52.983 --> 01:02:53.858
Don't worry about it.

01:02:53.983 --> 01:02:55.566
Is it work, Tom?

01:02:55.691 --> 01:02:57.001
Because I have heard that you've
blown your way through quite

01:02:57.025 --> 01:02:58.376
a few jobs and the
one thing about women

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.691
is that they can smell
failure a mile away.

01:03:00.816 --> 01:03:02.108
It's not work, OK?

01:03:02.233 --> 01:03:03.483
Is it sexual?

01:03:03.608 --> 01:03:05.525
Is there a midget
living in the basement?

01:03:05.650 --> 01:03:07.770
If there is, they are selling
the pump on the internet

01:03:07.816 --> 01:03:09.025
but I do not know if it works.

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:10.441
I don't need a pump!

01:03:10.566 --> 01:03:13.483
I thought of Sofia
alone and vulnerable.

01:03:13.608 --> 01:03:15.150
I don't like it

01:03:15.275 --> 01:03:16.626
I swear to God, Chip, if
you go anywhere near my wife,

01:03:16.650 --> 01:03:17.650
I will...

01:03:17.691 --> 01:03:18.983
What are you going to do, Tom?

01:03:19.108 --> 01:03:21.066
You're going to catch us
on your hidden camera?

01:03:21.191 --> 01:03:22.275
How do you know about that?

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:25.441
Let's drag.

01:03:25.566 --> 01:03:28.900
[screams]

01:03:34.525 --> 01:03:36.483
Son of a bitch.

01:03:36.608 --> 01:03:37.608
Chip!

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.066
Chip!

01:03:42.191 --> 01:03:44.775
I could not make
it up the steps.

01:03:44.900 --> 01:03:45.691
Hope I'm not imposing.

01:03:45.816 --> 01:03:48.983
[music playing]

01:04:22.025 --> 01:04:23.441
[laughter]

01:04:23.566 --> 01:04:26.191
Oh, it's not easy swimming
with just your arms.

01:04:26.316 --> 01:04:28.275
Especially when the
water's just 38 degrees.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.525
I can't believe
you're still alive!

01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:31.941
Always been a risk-taker, Sofia.

01:04:32.066 --> 01:04:34.941
I do like to test the limits.

01:04:35.066 --> 01:04:37.025
Chip, you fill this
house with warmth.

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:39.691
And we can really
use that right now.

01:04:39.816 --> 01:04:41.483
It isn't just that
Bob got fired,

01:04:41.608 --> 01:04:43.128
- but Tom and Sofia have been...
- Mom!

01:04:43.191 --> 01:04:44.066
Mom!

01:04:44.191 --> 01:04:45.271
Difficult. Well you have.

01:04:47.983 --> 01:04:49.025
Anyway.

01:04:49.150 --> 01:04:51.066
Anyway, I, uh, I rented a movie.

01:04:51.191 --> 01:04:52.900
I've got it in my
saddlebag, I was going

01:04:53.025 --> 01:04:54.983
to go home and watch it alone.

01:04:55.108 --> 01:04:58.983
Love to share it if
you guys are up to it.

01:04:59.108 --> 01:04:59.900
You want to see a movie?

01:05:00.025 --> 01:05:01.025
Sure, Chip.

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.733
MAN 7 [ON TV]: Make
yourself comfortable.

01:05:05.858 --> 01:05:07.733
I have some things to
do in the bathroom.

01:05:07.858 --> 01:05:08.858
WOMAN 2 [ON TV]: OK.

01:05:18.733 --> 01:05:20.608
I want you.

01:05:20.733 --> 01:05:23.608
What do I do?

01:05:23.733 --> 01:05:24.773
MAN 7 [ON TV]: Everything.

01:05:32.191 --> 01:05:33.066
That's OK.

01:05:33.191 --> 01:05:35.566
[doorbell rings]

01:05:38.191 --> 01:05:40.150
Sofia, I need to talk to you.

01:05:40.275 --> 01:05:42.525
Listen, you have every
right to be upset with me.

01:05:42.650 --> 01:05:43.751
Sweetie, I'm not angry. I just...

01:05:43.775 --> 01:05:44.566
Finish.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:45.566
Let me finish, OK?

01:05:45.691 --> 01:05:47.316
I finally figured it out.

01:05:47.441 --> 01:05:49.191
I didn't put the wrong
tape in the camera.

01:05:49.316 --> 01:05:50.608
- Chip switched it!
- What?

01:05:50.733 --> 01:05:52.150
Yeah, I was right
all along, baby.

01:05:52.275 --> 01:05:53.834
He's been trying to
sabotage me since day one

01:05:53.858 --> 01:05:55.358
and now I have proof.

01:05:55.483 --> 01:05:57.001
You can see his face, the
reflection, on my computer...

01:05:57.025 --> 01:05:58.316
Hi, Tom.

01:05:58.441 --> 01:06:00.233
What's he doing here?

01:06:00.358 --> 01:06:01.417
What are you doing with my son?

01:06:01.441 --> 01:06:02.441
Get the baby away from

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:03.733
Tom, cool it!

01:06:03.858 --> 01:06:05.441
Why don't you take the baby?

01:06:05.566 --> 01:06:07.376
What did you come over here
to get with my wife, Hot Wheels?

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.691
- [BOTH] Tom!
- Hot Wheels?

01:06:08.816 --> 01:06:10.691
Chip came over because
he heard dad got fired.

01:06:10.816 --> 01:06:11.691
Oh and how did that happen?

01:06:11.816 --> 01:06:12.858
Huh?

01:06:12.983 --> 01:06:14.303
The same way my
chair got shorter?

01:06:14.358 --> 01:06:17.275
The same way gay porn
got put on my computer?

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:19.066
You had everybody
fooled didn't you?

01:06:19.191 --> 01:06:20.233
You cripple?

01:06:20.358 --> 01:06:21.150
[BOTH] Tom!

01:06:21.275 --> 01:06:22.275
That's enough.

01:06:22.316 --> 01:06:23.608
Poor me, I'm in a wheelchair.

01:06:23.733 --> 01:06:25.501
Everybody feel sorry for
me and have sex with me

01:06:25.525 --> 01:06:26.900
because I can't use my legs.

01:06:27.025 --> 01:06:28.066
Or can he?

01:06:28.191 --> 01:06:29.608
He can walk.

01:06:29.733 --> 01:06:30.566
I have proof.

01:06:30.691 --> 01:06:31.441
What's that?

01:06:31.566 --> 01:06:32.650
What?

01:06:32.775 --> 01:06:33.941
Get up, you faker.

01:06:34.066 --> 01:06:35.275
You can walk.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.566
Let's show them how you walk!

01:06:36.691 --> 01:06:39.900
[screaming]

01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:49.233
Tom the man can't walk!

01:06:49.358 --> 01:06:50.150
Oh, yeah?

01:06:50.275 --> 01:06:51.025
Let's find out!

01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:53.941
[screaming]

01:06:55.983 --> 01:06:57.150
He's dead!

01:06:57.275 --> 01:06:58.275
I'm OK.

01:07:00.858 --> 01:07:02.608
This isn't Chip, it's Danny!

01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:03.566
Danny?

01:07:03.691 --> 01:07:05.858
He's Chip's twin brother.

01:07:05.983 --> 01:07:09.316
He died in an accident
about five years ago.

01:07:09.441 --> 01:07:10.775
He was my hero.

01:07:10.900 --> 01:07:12.025
Tom, get down here!

01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.983
Out of the house!

01:07:13.108 --> 01:07:14.275
Out of the house! Out!

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:15.608
BOB KOWALSKI: Tom!

01:07:15.733 --> 01:07:16.900
I found

01:07:17.025 --> 01:07:18.108
I found it... I saw his

01:07:18.233 --> 01:07:19.316
Tom, out!

01:07:19.441 --> 01:07:20.709
I saw his reflection
in... in my...

01:07:20.733 --> 01:07:21.483
Out!

01:07:21.608 --> 01:07:24.233
Out!

01:07:24.358 --> 01:07:25.733
For god's sakes, Tom.

01:07:25.858 --> 01:07:27.358
What the hell is
the matter with you?

01:07:27.483 --> 01:07:29.775
You just threw a disabled
man down a flight of stairs!

01:07:29.900 --> 01:07:31.483
Moushiwake, Bob.

01:07:31.608 --> 01:07:33.816
Now obviously I was wrong
about the cripple thing,

01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:38.025
but he's the one responsible
for you getting fired.

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:40.733
What the hell is wrong with you?

01:07:40.858 --> 01:07:43.858
You could've just killed him!

01:07:43.983 --> 01:07:45.650
Sofia

01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:46.566
I think you should go.

01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:50.025
[music playing]

01:08:18.066 --> 01:08:19.525
Are you sure you're OK?

01:08:19.650 --> 01:08:21.358
I'm fine.

01:08:21.483 --> 01:08:27.858
Um, what I'm really
worried about is you.

01:08:27.983 --> 01:08:31.775
Um, I can tell that
you're not happy

01:08:31.900 --> 01:08:35.483
and I think that it... it
might be because you're

01:08:35.608 --> 01:08:38.191
on the wrong track.

01:08:38.316 --> 01:08:40.525
I don't... I don't know.

01:08:40.650 --> 01:08:44.775
Maybe it's because you're
still looking for something

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:46.733
that you haven't found yet.

01:08:46.858 --> 01:08:47.858
You know, I mean...

01:08:50.316 --> 01:08:52.775
I... I know that I am.

01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:54.275
You know, I mean,
everybody thinks

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.525
that I've got everything,
you know, the Ohio.

01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:58.941
Advertiser of the Year.

01:08:59.066 --> 01:09:01.733
And probably be hired
to go to Barcelona soon.

01:09:01.858 --> 01:09:03.983
But I don't have anybody
I can share that with.

01:09:04.108 --> 01:09:09.941
You know, and the one person
that really does it for me

01:09:10.066 --> 01:09:15.150
is a girl that I met
back in high school.

01:09:15.275 --> 01:09:20.316
We are the Tigers and we're
not cocky, but we're run you...

01:09:20.441 --> 01:09:21.316
You know, kawasaki.

01:09:21.441 --> 01:09:22.858
Do you what I mean?

01:09:22.983 --> 01:09:25.816
I've still got your panties
from that time that...

01:09:25.941 --> 01:09:27.400
OK, Chip, I...

01:09:27.525 --> 01:09:28.566
It's time to go.

01:09:28.691 --> 01:09:30.150
OK, it's tough to hear I get it.

01:09:42.066 --> 01:09:43.546
Stay the hell away
from my wife, Chip.

01:09:46.275 --> 01:09:48.691
I got a newsflash
for you, Sparky.

01:09:48.816 --> 01:09:50.441
Your wife's gone.

01:09:50.566 --> 01:09:53.042
She's way out of your league and
she's finally realized it, OK?

01:09:53.066 --> 01:09:54.400
It's over.

01:09:54.525 --> 01:09:55.400
Easy.

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:56.608
Huh?

01:09:56.733 --> 01:09:57.959
You think I can't
defend myself just

01:09:57.983 --> 01:09:59.441
'cause I'm in a wheelchair?

01:09:59.566 --> 01:10:00.816
No I know Hapkido!

01:10:00.941 --> 01:10:03.650
Ah!

01:10:03.775 --> 01:10:05.255
That's for stealing
my yogurt, douche.

01:10:09.483 --> 01:10:13.108
You know what the worst
part is for me, Chip?

01:10:13.233 --> 01:10:15.400
You're a horrible person.

01:10:15.525 --> 01:10:18.066
I mean there is
just nobody worse.

01:10:18.191 --> 01:10:19.711
And yet because of
what you had to deal

01:10:19.816 --> 01:10:22.191
with being in that
chair, I actually still

01:10:22.316 --> 01:10:24.316
feel guilty for hating you.

01:10:24.441 --> 01:10:27.233
You know what I hate
most about you, Tom?

01:10:27.358 --> 01:10:28.917
It's not your gay voice,
probably thought I was

01:10:28.941 --> 01:10:30.400
going to say your gay voice.

01:10:30.525 --> 01:10:32.150
Actually no, but thank you.

01:10:32.275 --> 01:10:33.483
It's that you're weak.

01:10:33.608 --> 01:10:36.025
I've defeated you in
every possible way.

01:10:36.150 --> 01:10:38.030
I neutered you at work,
I've turned your in-laws

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:41.275
against you, and I'd say
I'm at most three days away

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.150
from mounting your
slutty wife again

01:10:43.275 --> 01:10:45.733
and you've got the
gall to pity me.

01:10:48.441 --> 01:10:50.441
Yeah.

01:10:50.566 --> 01:10:52.733
I guess I do.

01:10:52.858 --> 01:10:53.858
Yeah, don't.

01:11:01.775 --> 01:11:04.275
It's a miracle, he can stand.

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.233
I knew it!

01:11:05.358 --> 01:11:08.608
[screaming]

01:11:14.525 --> 01:11:18.233
You banged my wife with that
giant, uncircumcised ant-eater!

01:11:18.358 --> 01:11:19.525
Can't breathe, Tom.

01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:25.410
Why the hell would you
spend your entire life

01:11:25.525 --> 01:11:26.605
pretending to be paralyzed?

01:11:26.650 --> 01:11:28.775
What's wrong with you?

01:11:28.900 --> 01:11:31.191
You ever try to park at
the mall during Christmas?

01:11:31.316 --> 01:11:34.441
Or do you have any idea how much
easier it is to get sympathy

01:11:34.566 --> 01:11:36.066
sex when you can't walk?

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:37.400
You're a sociopath.

01:11:37.525 --> 01:11:38.834
Oh don't get the
wrong idea, I actually

01:11:38.858 --> 01:11:40.066
needed that chair for a while.

01:11:40.191 --> 01:11:42.400
When I was 14, I got
into a surprisingly

01:11:42.525 --> 01:11:44.108
violent hacky sack accident.

01:11:44.233 --> 01:11:46.514
And then a few weeks later,
came out here for high school,

01:11:46.566 --> 01:11:48.191
decided I'd milk
it a little bit.

01:11:48.316 --> 01:11:49.996
Do you think I'm not
going to tell everyone

01:11:50.025 --> 01:11:52.150
that's ever met you, you freak?

01:11:52.275 --> 01:11:53.955
You just threw an
innocent, handicapped guy

01:11:53.983 --> 01:11:54.983
down the stairs.

01:11:55.025 --> 01:11:57.483
No one's going to believe you.

01:11:57.608 --> 01:12:00.400
And, you know, you were just at
a very distinct advantage just

01:12:00.525 --> 01:12:03.150
then when you threw
me to the ground.

01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.191
All of my martial
arts training has

01:12:05.316 --> 01:12:07.858
been from the seated position.

01:12:07.983 --> 01:12:11.191
[screaming]

01:12:12.775 --> 01:12:14.066
Give it up, Chief.

01:12:14.191 --> 01:12:15.231
You're never going to win.

01:12:18.108 --> 01:12:20.025
See you at school tomorrow!

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:23.441
[phone rings]

01:12:25.983 --> 01:12:27.441

I am the Executive

the ad agency in Barcelona.

01:12:38.025 --> 01:12:39.816
You sent to us your resume.

01:12:39.941 --> 01:12:41.275
Yes! Hello!

01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:42.191
Ola!

good, thank you very much.

01:12:45.316 --> 01:12:47.042
Will you indulge me
please, sir, for one moment

01:12:47.066 --> 01:12:50.025
and allow me to say to you that
your work is absolutely genius?

01:12:50.150 --> 01:12:52.566
Senor Tomato is, in
a word, spectacular.

01:12:52.691 --> 01:12:53.483
Jesus, yes.

01:12:53.608 --> 01:12:54.775
Uh, thank you.

01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:56.150
Gracias.

very, very welcome.

01:12:57.358 --> 01:12:58.650
I come to the point.

01:12:58.775 --> 01:13:00.983
You, sir, are being
chosen for the position

01:13:01.108 --> 01:13:02.608
of Director Creativo.

01:13:02.733 --> 01:13:05.900
Can you fly to Barcelona
[speaking Spanish] please?

01:13:06.025 --> 01:13:07.316
Sure! Si!

01:13:07.441 --> 01:13:08.191
Gracias.

01:13:08.316 --> 01:13:09.108
Super.

MAN 9 [ON TV]: Tom!

01:13:17.150 --> 01:13:18.792
Wildman here, we set up a
meeting with the Wesley kid.

01:13:18.816 --> 01:13:20.126
But you probably
know all about it,

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:21.983
seeing as your
wife is his lawyer.

01:13:22.108 --> 01:13:22.858
Screw it.

01:13:22.983 --> 01:13:24.691
I'll send Chip...

01:13:24.816 --> 01:13:25.608
Shit!

01:13:25.733 --> 01:13:29.025
[music playing]

01:13:36.608 --> 01:13:37.608
Bob!

01:13:40.941 --> 01:13:42.858
Have you seen Sofia?

01:13:42.983 --> 01:13:45.483
No, I went to buy more scotch.

01:13:45.608 --> 01:13:47.275
When I... when I got
back she was gone.

01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:48.650
You all right?

01:13:48.775 --> 01:13:51.608
Bob, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:13:51.733 --> 01:13:55.358
The Wesley tape wasn't
destroyed in the fire, I

01:13:55.483 --> 01:13:56.983
I accidentally taped over it.

01:13:57.108 --> 01:13:58.691
Sofia told me last night.

01:13:58.816 --> 01:14:01.650
I told her the same
thing I'll say to you.

01:14:01.775 --> 01:14:06.483
The only person responsible
for me losing my job is me.

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:09.691
I also started the fire.

01:14:09.816 --> 01:14:10.816
It was an accident, I...

01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:15.483
I... I wasn't aware.

01:14:15.608 --> 01:14:17.525
Are you... are you OK?

01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:20.191
I bent over backwards
to sell Wollebin's vision

01:14:20.316 --> 01:14:23.275
and I, you know

01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:26.275
I knew in the back of
my mind it was bullshit.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:27.608
- It is bullshit, Bob.
- It is.

01:14:27.733 --> 01:14:29.066
- Screw him.
- Screw him!

01:14:29.191 --> 01:14:30.191
Screw him!

01:14:33.566 --> 01:14:36.108
You're all right, kid.

01:14:36.233 --> 01:14:37.733
You're all right.

01:14:37.858 --> 01:14:41.483
Sofia's getting ice cream
with Chip at Eddy's Sweets.

01:14:41.608 --> 01:14:42.608
Thank you, Bob.

01:14:50.275 --> 01:14:51.066
Oh Jesus, Tom.

01:14:51.191 --> 01:14:51.983
You got to take a shower!

01:14:52.108 --> 01:14:53.108
I'm sorry.

01:14:55.816 --> 01:14:57.016
BOB KOWALSKI: Go get her, son!

01:15:02.066 --> 01:15:04.983
KID: Hey, 5 bucks to whoever can
knock that tool off his bike.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.691
[laughs]

01:15:16.275 --> 01:15:17.275
Oh.

01:15:26.525 --> 01:15:27.751
These rims aren't
supposed to bend.

01:15:27.775 --> 01:15:31.066
