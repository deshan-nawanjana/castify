[wind blowing]

00:00:44.916 --> 00:00:46.333
[suspenseful music playing]

00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:50.750
[narrator] <i>Though many know
the tragic love story</i>

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.541
<i>of Antony and Cleopatra,</i>

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:54.625
<i>the wayward Roman general</i>

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:57.833
<i>who fell madly in love
with the enchanting Egyptian queen,</i>

00:00:57.916 --> 00:00:59.916
<i>both of them taking their lives</i>

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.083
<i>rather than face a world
without each other,</i>

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.041
<i>few know the secret story</i>

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:09.500
<i>of the most sought-after prize
and unsolved puzzle of their time.</i>

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:12.625
<i>The mystery of Cleopatra's third egg.</i>

00:01:13.625 --> 00:01:17.541
<i>On their wedding day,
as a symbol of his undying devotion,</i>

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:21.625
<i>Mark Antony presented Cleopatra
with three bejeweled eggs,</i>

00:01:21.708 --> 00:01:24.166
<i>each one more exquisite than the last.</i>

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:29.750
<i>For centuries, these eggs were thought
to be nothing more than myth, rumor.</i>

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.041
<i>But then, in 1907,</i>

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:36.625
<i>just outside of Cairo,
a local farmer unearthed two of them.</i>

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:39.833
<i>Some say the third egg was never found.</i>

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:41.708
<i>Others claim it was discovered,</i>

00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:45.791
<i>but just as quickly lost,
never to be seen again.</i>

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:49.166
<i>Join us as we explore that very question.</i>

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.791
<i>What happened to Cleopatra's lost egg?</i>

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:53.833
<i>Who may hold it in their possession?</i>

00:01:53.916 --> 00:01:56.916
<i>And most importantly,
will we ever see the day in which</i>

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.208
<i>all three eggs are reunited
for the first time in over 2,000 years?</i>

00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:06.375
<i>Cleopatra's first egg
is on display for all to see</i>

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:10.333
<i>at the world-famous Museo Nazionale
di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome.</i>

00:02:10.416 --> 00:02:13.875
<i>The second egg has been
sold at auction numerous times</i>

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:16.375
<i>and currently is held
in a private collection.</i>

00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:18.625
[dramatic music playing]

00:02:32.458 --> 00:02:35.166
[machinery whirring]

00:04:14.041 --> 00:04:16.208
[indistinct chatter]

00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:17.375
You're not a cop.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.041
You're right, I'm not.

00:04:19.125 --> 00:04:21.500
You know what I mean, Agent.
Your badge is no good here.

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.208
So no American cowboy stuff.

00:04:23.291 --> 00:04:25.083
Don't worry. Left my chaps at home.

00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:26.625
You sure about this?

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.541
I know how he thinks.
He's gonna do it today. Trust me.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:32.041
All right, then, here we go.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:36.458
[woman speaking Italian]

00:04:37.791 --> 00:04:39.671
- [man in English] Impossible.
- I'm not asking.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.166
You need to shut the museum down,
evacuate your visitors,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.458
and seal all ingress
and egress points immediately.

00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:47.000
And Interpol has the authority
to compel me to do so?

00:04:47.083 --> 00:04:48.500
Don't test me, Director.

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:49.625
You should listen to her.

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:51.208
And who are you? Her bodyguard?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:54.791
This is Special Agent John Hartley
of the FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:57.791
He's a consulting profiler
who specializes in art crime.

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.166
You don't look like a profiler.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.958
Yeah, I get that a lot.

00:05:03.541 --> 00:05:06.541
Forty-one hours ago, Agent Hartley
received credible intelligence that

00:05:06.625 --> 00:05:10.000
the most wanted art thief in the world,
a man named Nolan Booth,

00:05:10.083 --> 00:05:12.583
intends to steal
the Egg of Cleopatra today.

00:05:13.916 --> 00:05:15.750
Who provided you this information?

00:05:15.833 --> 00:05:16.833
The Bishop.

00:05:16.916 --> 00:05:18.458
You cannot be serious.

00:05:18.958 --> 00:05:23.125
My dear, The Bishop is nothing more
than a boogeyman story in the art world.

00:05:23.208 --> 00:05:25.250
It's a catch-all concept.
It's someone to blame

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.053
when you and your friends
in law enforcement

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:29.541
are too incompetent to solve the case.

00:05:29.625 --> 00:05:33.208
Listen to me, unless we stop it,
that egg is gonna be stolen today.

00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:35.000
In fact, it may already be gone.

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:45.333
[guard speaking Italian]

00:05:45.416 --> 00:05:47.416
[regal musical flourish]

00:05:52.041 --> 00:05:53.441
[in English] Already gone, you say?

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:58.833
Now, if you'll excuse me, Inspector,
I believe I owe your supervisor a call.

00:06:01.875 --> 00:06:04.000
Do you have thermal sensors in this room?

00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.041
- Of course we do.
- Show it to me.

00:06:17.375 --> 00:06:18.833
[director] You're wasting our time.

00:06:18.916 --> 00:06:21.708
What, may I ask, are you looking for?

00:06:21.791 --> 00:06:25.333
Well, you see, Cleopatra's first egg
is covered in 18-karat gold.

00:06:25.416 --> 00:06:26.916
And gold reflects radiation.

00:06:27.666 --> 00:06:29.958
That egg should be
reflecting the heat in this room.

00:06:30.041 --> 00:06:31.833
It should be red, not blue.

00:06:33.083 --> 00:06:35.541
It's probably just an error
in the thermal sensor.

00:06:35.625 --> 00:06:37.500
Well, there's only one way to find out.

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:46.583
Hey, sorry, big man, but there's
no food or drink in the museum.

00:06:49.666 --> 00:06:50.666
Thank you.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.120
No, no, wait a moment.
What do you think you're doing?

00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:58.083
[woman] Relax, it's fine.
He knows what he's doing.

00:06:58.166 --> 00:06:59.291
[crowd murmuring]

00:06:59.375 --> 00:07:01.541
[crowd gasping]

00:07:01.625 --> 00:07:04.541
[sizzling]

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:18.666
Seal the room. Now!

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.520
- [alarm blaring]
- [people exclaiming]

00:07:23.208 --> 00:07:25.083
[dramatic music playing]

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:27.375
[people screaming]

00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.083
Move! Move!

00:07:34.125 --> 00:07:35.583
He's heading for the exit.

00:07:37.958 --> 00:07:39.291
[grunts]

00:07:40.083 --> 00:07:41.666
[breathing heavily]

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:47.958

00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:51.416
[motor whirring]

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:52.583
[breathing heavily]

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:57.875
Oh.

00:08:01.333 --> 00:08:02.833
[device emitting high-pitched sound]

00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:05.958
Freeze!

00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:07.333
[people screaming]

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.708
[people shouting]

00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:11.625
[panting]

00:08:15.125 --> 00:08:17.000
[both panting]

00:08:51.041 --> 00:08:53.101
[guard 1 in Italian] He is here.
Send reinforcements.

00:08:53.125 --> 00:08:54.125
[panting]

00:09:00.208 --> 00:09:01.291
[guard 1 speaking Italian]

00:09:01.375 --> 00:09:02.833
[grunts]

00:09:02.916 --> 00:09:04.041
- [grunting]
- [gasps]

00:09:04.916 --> 00:09:06.208
[guard grunts]

00:09:06.291 --> 00:09:07.291

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:22.208
[guard 2 grunts]

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:27.416
He's on the scaffolding.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.375
We're gonna need more... [grunts]

00:09:33.125 --> 00:09:34.875
[screaming]

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.500
[groans]

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:46.750
[screams, grunts]

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:53.958
[both grunting]

[guards exclaiming]

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:13.958
[screams]

00:10:17.458 --> 00:10:20.458
- [chuckling] Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Ah. [tuts]

00:10:20.541 --> 00:10:23.208
[in English] Jesus,
you scared me. [chuckles]

00:10:24.666 --> 00:10:27.833
I know you. You're the... You're the slow
bald guy that's been chasing me.

00:10:27.916 --> 00:10:29.291
What do you got in the bag?

00:10:30.041 --> 00:10:32.125
You're American. What brings you to Rome?

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.000
Gelato, the Colosseum.

00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:36.851
- Oh, it's beautiful. Beautiful place.
- Yeah.

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:38.833
- First time?
- Yep.

00:10:38.916 --> 00:10:42.583
[Booth] That was a fun foot chase, right?
Lots of twists and turns. Hijinks.

00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:43.906
Who knew it'd end up like this?

00:10:43.958 --> 00:10:45.833
- I did.
- Right.

00:10:45.916 --> 00:10:48.750
Fun's over, Nolan Booth.
Give me the bag, turn around,

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:50.892
put your hands behind your back.
You're under arrest.

00:10:50.916 --> 00:10:53.875
Okay. Well, hold on one sec.
I just have two questions.

00:10:53.958 --> 00:10:55.458
Okay. Um...

00:10:55.541 --> 00:10:58.125
First question,
where'd you get that jacket?

00:10:58.208 --> 00:10:59.458
It's a statement piece.

00:10:59.958 --> 00:11:02.916
Somewhere there is a very nude cow
whispering...

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000
[whispers] ..."Worth it."

00:11:04.541 --> 00:11:07.541
And number two, on the whole
arresting me thing, I totally get it.

00:11:07.625 --> 00:11:10.208
You know, baby did a bad, bad thing. Yeah.

00:11:10.291 --> 00:11:13.250
But you don't happen to have,
like, a badge or somethin'

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:15.791
tucked away in the turtleneck, do you?

00:11:16.416 --> 00:11:18.708
I don't need to show you my badge
because I've got a gun.

00:11:18.791 --> 00:11:20.750
Here's the thing.
You're putting me in a pickle.

00:11:20.833 --> 00:11:22.793
Without identification,
how do I know who you are?

00:11:22.875 --> 00:11:24.666
For all I know, you could be the bad guy,

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.291
and I could be the other bad guy.

00:11:29.083 --> 00:11:30.875
You're right. I am the bad guy.

00:11:30.958 --> 00:11:33.750
Now shut up and give me the bag
before I shoot you in the mouth.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.090
- I'm gonna give this to you.
- [Hartley] Good.

00:11:36.583 --> 00:11:39.750
Yeah, I'm just gonna give it to you
'cause I don't even want it.

00:11:39.833 --> 00:11:41.750
For the record, none of this feels good.

00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:43.000
Booth, don't move!

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:44.083
[Hartley grunts]

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:46.125

[both grunting]

00:12:00.083 --> 00:12:01.416
[Booth] Whoa!

00:12:02.625 --> 00:12:04.083
[grunts, groaning]

00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.625
[woman panting]

00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:08.208
Come on, let's go.

00:12:42.291 --> 00:12:43.791

- [groans]
- [man shouting]

00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:50.583
Where are you going?

00:12:50.625 --> 00:12:51.625
Asshole!

00:12:53.625 --> 00:12:54.750
[panting]

00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:56.553
[in English]
Can you hold on to this for me?

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.250
- Thanks.
- [sputtering]

00:13:26.375 --> 00:13:28.434
[in Italian] What the hell?
You idiot! Are you blind?

00:13:28.458 --> 00:13:30.791
[in English] Shit. [grunts]

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.000

00:14:43.916 --> 00:14:44.916
[gulps]

00:14:54.541 --> 00:14:58.208
Special Agent John Hartley, FBI.
We met earlier.

00:14:58.833 --> 00:15:02.375
Aren't you a little outside
your jurisdiction?

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:04.250
I am.

00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:07.791
Good thing these guys aren't.

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:09.000
[man shouts]

00:15:10.916 --> 00:15:11.916
[guns cocking]

00:15:12.750 --> 00:15:13.750
Wow!

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.666
Hi, guys.
Don't take your shoes off or anything.

00:15:20.916 --> 00:15:22.236
You sure you brought enough guns?

00:15:22.291 --> 00:15:24.250
What can I say? I like to be thorough.

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:27.041
[Booth] No way, José.

00:15:27.125 --> 00:15:30.791
- The intrepid Inspector Das.
- [scoffs]

00:15:30.875 --> 00:15:34.375
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
I'll take that. Thank you.

00:15:34.458 --> 00:15:36.833
- It's nice to meet a fan.
- [Das] Oh, that's cute.

00:15:36.916 --> 00:15:38.583
You wanna know what else is cute?

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:40.750
Because you're wanted
in 18 separate countries,

00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:43.114
I get to choose which one of them
detains you until trial,

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:44.583
given your escape history.

00:15:44.666 --> 00:15:45.866
What are you, six for six now?

00:15:45.916 --> 00:15:48.000
Yeah. One more
and I get a Shawshank jacket.

00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:48.958
Keep making your jokes

00:15:49.041 --> 00:15:51.476
because I'm about to send you
to the worst place in the world.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.708
Your Instagram account?

00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:55.875
You know,
I'm really starting to not like you.

00:15:55.958 --> 00:15:57.166
Oh, come on!

00:15:57.250 --> 00:15:59.583
Not like me? You don't even know me.

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:01.791
We could have a lot in common.

00:16:01.875 --> 00:16:05.625
[scoffs] Maybe I don't know you,
but I've been building a profile on you,

00:16:05.708 --> 00:16:08.625
ever since you stole William Strang's
<i>Lady with a Red Hat </i>from the Tate

00:16:08.708 --> 00:16:09.958
back in 2014.

00:16:10.041 --> 00:16:11.375
You can't prove that was me.

00:16:17.125 --> 00:16:18.416
I got that on Etsy.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.680
I've been tracking
your scores for a while.

00:16:22.708 --> 00:16:25.041
So let me take a crack
at who I think you really are.

00:16:25.875 --> 00:16:26.916
Sure thing. Yeah.

00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:29.333
- Only child.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:16:29.416 --> 00:16:32.375
[Hartley] Dad's a Swiss cop,
Mom's an American professor.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.708
You started stealing
between the ages of six and eight.

00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:39.791
You found out
you had a real talent for it.

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:41.750
It made you feel special, different.

00:16:41.833 --> 00:16:44.583
You like to work alone.
You don't like a team.

00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:47.708
The only jobs you take are the ones
that make the big, splashy headlines,

00:16:47.791 --> 00:16:51.833
which tells me that you only do it
for the thrill and not the money.

00:16:51.916 --> 00:16:54.458
Are you insane? I love the money.

00:16:55.375 --> 00:16:58.750
I'm not done yet.
I'm just getting to the good part.

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:00.208
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:03.250
A lot of thieves out there
who claim to only do it for the money.

00:17:03.333 --> 00:17:04.625
That's not unusual.

00:17:05.208 --> 00:17:08.375
But what is unusual
is the risk that you take.

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:10.250
The chances.

00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:15.916
It's as though you wanna get caught
so you can escape,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.791
just to prove yourself all over again,

00:17:17.875 --> 00:17:20.416
and prove that
you're better than everybody else

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.833
and that you're worthy.

00:17:22.916 --> 00:17:24.583
Worthy of what? This speech?

00:17:24.666 --> 00:17:26.041
Your father's love.

00:17:36.416 --> 00:17:37.750
Congratulations.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.458
How'd you find me?

00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:43.708
Well, the same way I knew that
you were gonna steal the egg in Rome.

00:17:45.625 --> 00:17:46.916
[whispers] The Bishop.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.166
[whispers] The Bishop.

00:17:49.208 --> 00:17:50.875
[normally] Get him ready to move.

00:17:56.416 --> 00:17:58.791
[police radio chatter]

00:18:08.083 --> 00:18:09.083
Booth, I'm curious.

00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:12.791
How does it feel to be sold out
by the most wanted art thief in the world?

00:18:13.291 --> 00:18:15.500
I'm the most wanted art thief
in the world.

00:18:16.791 --> 00:18:17.791
You were.

00:18:18.916 --> 00:18:20.291
[Das] Wait. Wait here.

00:18:23.791 --> 00:18:26.500
There's no chance I'm putting
that thing in the same van as him.

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:32.166
- See you at the airfield.
- I'll see you there.

00:18:33.375 --> 00:18:34.958
[suspenseful music playing]

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:45.458
[car engines starting]

00:18:54.666 --> 00:18:56.833
[officer speaking Indonesian]
[alarm buzzing]

00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:58.833
[in English] Door open.

00:19:33.208 --> 00:19:34.500
[sighs]

00:19:34.583 --> 00:19:35.833
All right. We're good.

00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:52.375
- [upbeat music playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

00:19:53.333 --> 00:19:54.625
Thank you.

00:20:01.208 --> 00:20:02.208
Hi, there.

00:20:06.458 --> 00:20:08.498
- You leaving town?
- [Hartley] Flight's in an hour.

00:20:08.541 --> 00:20:09.625
Something up?

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.416
You could say that. Hmm.

00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.000
Okay. What's going on?

00:20:14.083 --> 00:20:16.375
[chuckles] Funny,
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:26.118
What are you doing with that?

00:20:26.166 --> 00:20:32.125
Oh, this priceless piece
of ancient cultural whatnot?

00:20:32.625 --> 00:20:33.916
[gasps]

00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:37.583
[dramatic music playing]

00:20:38.208 --> 00:20:39.583
Oops!

00:20:39.666 --> 00:20:41.166
Booth gave us a fake egg.

00:20:41.250 --> 00:20:43.500
I'll admit,
Booth was my first thought too.

00:20:43.583 --> 00:20:45.809
Then I asked myself,
"How well do you really know someone

00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:47.708
you only met 72 hours ago?"

00:20:47.791 --> 00:20:49.458
And someone whose official credentials

00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:52.083
came solely by
a written interagency communiqué.

00:20:52.166 --> 00:20:57.875
So I called up the Assistant Director
of the BAU at Quantico, really nice lady.

00:20:57.958 --> 00:20:59.083
She'd never heard of you.

00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:00.708
- That's impossible.
- [Das] Is it?

00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:01.875
Yes, it's impossible.

00:21:01.958 --> 00:21:04.198
As impossible as a John Hartley
with a Swiss bank account

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.458
that received an $8 million wire transfer

00:21:06.541 --> 00:21:09.500
from an encrypted third-party
on the same day the egg was stolen?

00:21:09.583 --> 00:21:12.875
Quite a coincidence,
wouldn't you say, Agent?

00:21:12.958 --> 00:21:14.791
[officer 1 shouting in Italian]

00:21:16.875 --> 00:21:18.958
[officer 2 over radio]
<i>We have eyes on target.</i>

00:21:19.041 --> 00:21:22.875
Listen, whatever you think this is,
whatever you think I did, I didn't do.

00:21:23.458 --> 00:21:26.333
Someone's behind this.
The Bishop, maybe even Booth himself.

00:21:26.416 --> 00:21:28.517
- I'm being set up.
- Maybe you are, maybe you're not.

00:21:28.541 --> 00:21:31.017
Until I figure it out,
I'm gonna keep you where I can find you.

00:21:31.041 --> 00:21:34.416
Now, normally,
I'm not a vindictive person, but,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.250
well, I trusted you
and you hurt my feelings.

00:21:37.833 --> 00:21:39.458
So I picked someplace extra special.

00:21:39.541 --> 00:21:42.500
It's a bit of a black site.
Kind of the land due process forgot.

00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:44.750
You're under arrest, Agent Hartley.

00:21:44.833 --> 00:21:47.083
Das, look at me. Look at my eyes.

00:21:50.666 --> 00:21:51.791
I didn't do this.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:56.708
I don't believe you.

00:21:57.208 --> 00:21:59.083
[ominous music playing]

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.458
[inmates shouting indistinctly]

00:22:38.208 --> 00:22:40.083
[inmates laughing]

00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:57.291
You a top or a bottom? [grunts]

00:22:57.375 --> 00:23:00.500
Doesn't matter.
Prison's gonna decide for us.

00:23:00.583 --> 00:23:01.833
You gotta be shittin' me.

00:23:01.916 --> 00:23:04.583
[Booth] Well, I'll say one thing
about ol' Inspector Das,

00:23:04.666 --> 00:23:05.958
she's got a real sense of humor.

00:23:06.458 --> 00:23:07.833
Put 'er there, roomie.

00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:11.708
You're right, we should wash up first.

00:23:11.791 --> 00:23:13.708
It's okay. You're safe here.

00:23:15.541 --> 00:23:19.666
Except if they find out you're a cop.
Then they're gonna wanna kill you.

00:23:19.750 --> 00:23:21.041
[alarm buzzing]

00:23:23.333 --> 00:23:27.625
[indistinct chatter]

00:23:28.208 --> 00:23:31.125
[Booth] Bishop must have seen you
coming from a mile away.

00:23:31.208 --> 00:23:33.125
Got your trust after selling me out.

00:23:33.208 --> 00:23:36.541
Can't run a con without gaining
the mark's trust first, that's page one.

00:23:37.250 --> 00:23:39.500
I know how a confidence scheme works,
trust me.

00:23:39.583 --> 00:23:41.666
[Booth] Well, you do now, that's for sure.

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:45.000
The same mystery thief who ratted me out
is the same one who framed you.

00:23:45.083 --> 00:23:46.958
That seems like a coincidence,
don't you think?

00:23:47.541 --> 00:23:50.083
This is not a coincidence. This is a plan.

00:23:50.708 --> 00:23:54.166
In one move, The Bishop took out
her lead competitor and lead investigator.

00:23:54.916 --> 00:23:56.541
- Two birds, one stone.
- Egg.

00:23:56.625 --> 00:23:59.041
- What?
- Two birds, one egg.

00:23:59.125 --> 00:24:01.625
It's kind of a lay-up.
Even Post Malone gets it.

00:24:02.291 --> 00:24:04.791
This is farm-to-table, right? Thank you.

00:24:04.875 --> 00:24:06.500
I don't understand why.

00:24:06.583 --> 00:24:09.823
Why would The Bishop go to the trouble of
framing me when she already has the egg?

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.166
I mean, what's left?

00:24:12.666 --> 00:24:14.166
Three hundred million dollars?

00:24:14.791 --> 00:24:16.958
You're kidding.
I never heard of a price tag like that.

00:24:17.041 --> 00:24:17.958
No one has.

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:21.000
But you don't understand,
that's not the price for just one egg.

00:24:21.583 --> 00:24:22.750
Here's the deal.

00:24:22.833 --> 00:24:26.375
Whoever brings
this Egyptian billionaire all three eggs

00:24:26.458 --> 00:24:30.583
by the night of his daughter's wedding
gets all the marbles.

00:24:30.666 --> 00:24:33.958
Turns out,
Mr. Big Daddy Big Bucks' daughter,

00:24:34.041 --> 00:24:35.166
guess what her name is?

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:36.666
Stop guessing, it's Cleopatra.

00:24:37.333 --> 00:24:41.458
I mean, these people are horrible.
But I like money, so...

00:24:42.041 --> 00:24:43.208
So how does that work?

00:24:43.791 --> 00:24:46.458
No one knows where the third egg is.
It's never been found.

00:24:46.541 --> 00:24:49.833
I'm not gonna lie,
that's a bit of a problem.

00:24:49.916 --> 00:24:51.958
I was gonna deal with
the second egg first.

00:24:52.041 --> 00:24:53.333
Then the rest.

00:24:53.416 --> 00:24:56.666
[sighs] All right, well,
Bureau intel says that the second egg

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:58.458
is owned by an international arms dealer.

00:24:58.541 --> 00:25:00.250
Sotto Voce. I know all about this guy.

00:25:00.333 --> 00:25:02.666
His dad tried to strangle him
when he was 14.

00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:05.041
Nobody can stand
this son of a bitch. [chuckles]

00:25:06.083 --> 00:25:08.125
<i>Apparently, it left
quite the impression on him.</i>

00:25:08.208 --> 00:25:11.500
<i>And strangling folks
became sort of a hobby for him.</i>

00:25:12.208 --> 00:25:13.291
<i>He's a big fan.</i>

00:25:13.375 --> 00:25:14.625
[man choking]

00:25:14.708 --> 00:25:17.041
[Booth] <i>Sotto Voce is super scary.</i>

00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:18.666
<i>But he's not above having a good time.</i>

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:22.000
<i>Throws a masquerade party every year
for his top buyers</i>

00:25:22.083 --> 00:25:25.208
<i>in his I-probably-have-a-tiny-penis villa
in Valencia.</i>

00:25:25.291 --> 00:25:27.500
<i>Gunrunners are a little touchy
about their identity.</i>

00:25:27.583 --> 00:25:30.958
<i>So the</i> Eyes Wide Shut <i>thing
takes the edge off for everyone.</i>

00:25:31.041 --> 00:25:34.000
<i>Now, what none of these
evil one-percenters know</i>

00:25:34.083 --> 00:25:36.583
<i>is that upstairs,
locked away in a secret vault,</i>

00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:39.458
<i>Dr. Shirtless has in his possession</i>

00:25:39.541 --> 00:25:42.375
<i>an ancient piece of pricelessness
that I like to call...</i>

00:25:43.583 --> 00:25:45.541
<i>Cleopatra's second egg.</i>

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.875
And it's just begging for me to steal it.

00:25:49.958 --> 00:25:52.708
I'd be on my way there right now
if you weren't such a super cop.

00:25:54.750 --> 00:25:56.059
- Don't do that.
- [whispers] What?

00:25:56.083 --> 00:25:57.708
- Don't do that.
- [whispers] Do what?

00:25:57.791 --> 00:26:01.416
- I know what you're doing. Listen.
- [whispers] I'm not doing anything.

00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:04.750
[whispering] These guys here,
if they find out you're a C-O-P...

00:26:04.833 --> 00:26:08.250
This is a room full of convicted murderers
and toilet vodka enthusiasts.

00:26:08.333 --> 00:26:10.416
We gotta make sure
they know you're not a cop.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.791
- [yelling] <i>Nyet politsiya.</i>
- [in English] Listen to me. I beg...

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.958
Guys? <i>Nyet politsiya. </i>Not a cop.

00:26:18.041 --> 00:26:21.458
This man is not a cop, all right?

00:26:21.541 --> 00:26:23.625
Get that through
your thick skulls right now!

00:26:23.708 --> 00:26:26.375
He's a profiler for the FBI,

00:26:26.458 --> 00:26:30.416
which does fall under the umbrella
of law enforcement, but not a cop.

00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.916
It's similar, but it's not the same thing.
It's a complicated backstory.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.666
This is our good friend,
Special Agent John Hartley.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:39.208
Let's give him a warm welcome
to the prison, guys.

00:26:39.875 --> 00:26:40.916
[prisoner 1 clears throat]

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.916
[prisoner 2 coughs]

00:26:44.875 --> 00:26:48.000
Thank you, guys. [whispering]
I don't think anyone heard me. We're good.

00:26:48.083 --> 00:26:49.833
All's quiet on the western front.

00:26:49.916 --> 00:26:52.166
- Nobody's... Oh, no.
- [objects clattering]

00:26:52.250 --> 00:26:55.375
[Booth] Yep.
Drago Grande heard. Here he comes.

00:26:57.333 --> 00:26:59.291
[whispering] Okay, be cool.
Don't embarrass me.

00:27:02.625 --> 00:27:03.958
[normally] Hello, sir.

00:27:05.291 --> 00:27:06.500
<i>Politsiya.</i>

00:27:08.291 --> 00:27:09.375
You die.

00:27:09.458 --> 00:27:11.125
[whispering] Okay, he knows.

00:27:11.833 --> 00:27:13.125
He knows you're a cop.

00:27:13.708 --> 00:27:14.791
The jig is up.

00:27:22.958 --> 00:27:24.916
[all exclaiming]

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.083
[whispering] It's okay.

00:27:27.291 --> 00:27:28.375
You can...

00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:31.458
You can have mine.
You need some nourishment.

00:27:33.791 --> 00:27:36.833
[all exclaiming]

00:27:36.916 --> 00:27:40.000
[whispering] You should get up.
You look like a little bitch right now.

00:27:40.083 --> 00:27:41.416
I say that as a friend.

00:27:44.333 --> 00:27:45.416
[Hartley sighs]

00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:47.041
Okay, look.

00:27:47.625 --> 00:27:50.083
I don't wanna do
the whole prison fight thing with you...

00:27:50.166 --> 00:27:54.375
- [soft] You got this. I'm in your corner.
- So please, no fight.

00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:56.750
Let's just go back and finish our meals.

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:58.583
[both grunting]

00:27:59.166 --> 00:28:01.125
[grunts, groans]

00:28:01.208 --> 00:28:03.208
[all cheering]

00:28:11.416 --> 00:28:13.708
- No. No...
- [guard in Russian] Back to your cell!

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:15.958
[Booth in English] God...

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.458
All that working out.

00:28:19.041 --> 00:28:21.802
You still get your ass spanked
by a toothless man with tuberculosis...

00:28:21.833 --> 00:28:23.958
Okay. Okay.

00:28:24.041 --> 00:28:27.083
If you ever pull shit like that again,
it'll be the last thing you do.

00:28:27.166 --> 00:28:28.250
Right.

00:28:28.333 --> 00:28:30.625
- You don't know me, Booth.
- No.

00:28:30.708 --> 00:28:32.291
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

00:28:32.375 --> 00:28:34.416
Okay. Thank God, you're here.

00:28:35.791 --> 00:28:37.750
[in Russian] The captain wants to see you.

00:28:37.833 --> 00:28:38.666
Let's go!

00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:39.875
[in English] Him?

00:28:39.958 --> 00:28:41.583
Oh, no, us. Okay.

00:28:49.541 --> 00:28:50.666
[Booth sighs]

00:28:53.583 --> 00:28:54.708
Hello, boys.

00:28:55.458 --> 00:28:56.625
Oh, my God.

00:28:56.708 --> 00:28:57.791
Wow.

00:28:58.791 --> 00:29:00.250
You're the captain?

00:29:00.333 --> 00:29:03.250
You might benefit
from a little career change. [chuckles]

00:29:03.333 --> 00:29:05.208
I mean, I'm... I don't think runway,

00:29:05.291 --> 00:29:08.250
but definitely
regional catalog work, fliers...

00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:09.333
She's The Bishop.

00:29:09.416 --> 00:29:11.958
No shit, dipdick!

00:29:12.041 --> 00:29:15.208
It's so nice to finally meet you,
Mr. Booth.

00:29:15.291 --> 00:29:17.916
Such a thrill to be face-to-face

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.416
with the second-best art thief
in the world.

00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:24.875
Oh, I see what you did there.
That's... [chuckles]

00:29:24.958 --> 00:29:28.083
Yeah, you got lucky
a couple of times early on, you know?

00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:31.250
But you can't name one time
in the past year that you beat me.

00:29:31.333 --> 00:29:33.041
- Helsinki.
- My parachute failed.

00:29:33.125 --> 00:29:34.041
Jakarta.

00:29:34.125 --> 00:29:36.166
- My Segway sank.
- Macau.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:38.250
Nobody knew that Miley Cyrus
was going to be there.

00:29:38.291 --> 00:29:39.916
It was a completely unannounced show.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.875
You can have excuses or results.

00:29:42.958 --> 00:29:44.625
- [whispers] Not both.
- [scoffs]

00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:46.791
What are we doing here? What do you want?

00:29:46.875 --> 00:29:48.750
To have a chat.

00:29:48.833 --> 00:29:50.166
First of all, Agent Hartley,

00:29:50.291 --> 00:29:54.041
please accept my sincerest apologies
for the whole mix-up in Rome.

00:29:54.125 --> 00:29:56.666
<i>You see, after I stole the egg in Bali,</i>

00:29:56.750 --> 00:30:01.958
<i>I then made an $8 million deposit
into an account registered in your name.</i>

00:30:02.625 --> 00:30:06.916
<i>Then, all I had to do was sit back
and wait for Das to take the bait.</i>

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.666
[cell phone ringing]

00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:12.541
<i>A few clever keystrokes
and a well-timed call intercept.</i>

00:30:12.625 --> 00:30:14.791
[The Bishop] <i>FBI BAU Director's office.</i>

00:30:14.875 --> 00:30:16.958
And poof. [gasps]

00:30:17.041 --> 00:30:19.333
[mockingly] Bye-bye, Agent John Hartley.

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:22.583
Hello, suspicious suspect.

00:30:22.666 --> 00:30:24.333
Funny, don't you think?

00:30:24.416 --> 00:30:26.125
[laughing]

00:30:26.208 --> 00:30:28.083
Shut up. You deleted my life.

00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:30.208
And now I'm stuck in a cell
with this idiot.

00:30:31.291 --> 00:30:34.041
Well, down to business then.

00:30:34.125 --> 00:30:36.750
At the risk of stating the obvious,

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:39.375
I have the first egg in my possession,

00:30:39.458 --> 00:30:43.666
and in less than 48 hours,
I'm gonna have the second one as well.

00:30:45.041 --> 00:30:49.416
But that leaves an issue. The final egg.

00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:52.000
Well, too bad for you.
Nobody knows where the third egg is.

00:30:52.791 --> 00:30:54.166
He didn't tell you?

00:30:54.791 --> 00:30:56.125
You didn't tell him?

00:30:56.791 --> 00:30:59.059
- Didn't tell me what?
- I don't know what she's talking about.

00:30:59.083 --> 00:31:01.458
Your cellmate here
knows exactly where the third egg is.

00:31:01.541 --> 00:31:04.833
She's lying. I do not know
where the third egg is. I swear to God.

00:31:05.875 --> 00:31:08.208
[Booth] <i>I know where the third egg is.
I swear to God.</i>

00:31:08.750 --> 00:31:12.291
Yes, that is me. Scratch that.
That was me. I did say that.

00:31:12.375 --> 00:31:14.625
When were you gonna tell me
about the third egg?

00:31:14.708 --> 00:31:18.000
I was never gonna tell you
about the third egg because you're a cop.

00:31:18.083 --> 00:31:20.458
[The Bishop]
My offer to you, Mr. Booth, is this.

00:31:20.541 --> 00:31:24.750
Tell me where the third egg is,
I'll get you out of here and give you 10%.

00:31:24.833 --> 00:31:26.041
Rock-hard pass.

00:31:26.125 --> 00:31:28.125
I'm sorry we couldn't do business.

00:31:28.916 --> 00:31:31.166
Well, perhaps a few more days in here

00:31:31.250 --> 00:31:35.125
with the prospect
of thousands more to come

00:31:36.041 --> 00:31:37.875
will help change your mind. [chuckles]

00:31:38.833 --> 00:31:40.916
I'll stop by once I have the second egg.

00:31:41.416 --> 00:31:44.625
Oh, and when I do,
the offer's gonna be 5%.

00:31:44.708 --> 00:31:48.291
[in Russian] Thank you, Captain.
Labor detail for them both.

00:31:49.833 --> 00:31:52.625
[in English] Bye. Don't miss me too much.

00:31:52.708 --> 00:31:53.916
Ta-ta!

00:31:56.416 --> 00:31:58.083
Oh, hey, guys. [chuckles] Okay!

00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:00.958
[Hartley]
If we work together to catch her,

00:32:01.041 --> 00:32:03.333
I can do things
to The Bishop you can't do.

00:32:03.416 --> 00:32:05.016
[Booth]
There's no need to be disgusting.

00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:07.541
[both grunting]

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.916
Here we go. Three, two, one.
Lift with your neck.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.250
I mean put her in prison. For life.

00:32:15.125 --> 00:32:18.625
When that happens, guess who becomes
number one art thief in the world again?

00:32:20.666 --> 00:32:23.708
Teamwork? It feels weird in my mouth.

00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:24.875
Are you carrying your side?

00:32:24.958 --> 00:32:27.833
- I'm offended you'd even ask me that.
- [grunting]

00:32:27.916 --> 00:32:30.750
- Do something. It's slipping.
- Oh, relax, baldylocks.

00:32:31.375 --> 00:32:32.500
[grunts]

00:32:35.875 --> 00:32:38.041
See? Teamwork.

00:32:39.250 --> 00:32:43.208
Team. Team. Team.
[chuckling] It feels weird in my mouth.

00:32:43.291 --> 00:32:44.291
It does.

00:32:44.833 --> 00:32:49.083
Say what you will about Russian prisons,
the soap is incredible.

00:32:49.166 --> 00:32:51.927
- Are we doing this together or not?
- No added chemicals or perfumes.

00:32:51.958 --> 00:32:54.500
It's just pure
good ol' fashioned glycerin.

00:32:55.416 --> 00:32:58.083
- Ooh. Smell it.
- I'm not gonna smell it.

00:32:58.166 --> 00:33:00.791
Sotto Voce's masquerade ball
is tomorrow night,

00:33:00.875 --> 00:33:03.309
which means, if we're gonna beat
The Bishop to the second egg,

00:33:03.333 --> 00:33:06.291
we have to be on the other side
of these walls by tomorrow morning.

00:33:06.375 --> 00:33:07.895
I already know how I'm gonna steal it.

00:33:07.958 --> 00:33:10.851
It'll take adjustment now The Bishop'll
be there, but I'll beat her to the punch.

00:33:10.875 --> 00:33:13.083
"I"? What about "we"?

00:33:13.166 --> 00:33:16.041
Why are you wearing the hairnet?
You're bald.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:22.625
Okay, fine. You can be my plus-one
to Sotto Voce's party.

00:33:23.333 --> 00:33:27.583
[Hartley] Thanks. Clock's tickin'.
We gotta get outta here. What's the plan?

00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:29.250
[Booth] I'm working on it.

00:33:30.875 --> 00:33:33.166
You're working on it?
You sound like you're working on it.

00:33:33.250 --> 00:33:36.583
They say the most important part
of any plan is a good night's sleep.

00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:40.666
Isn't the actual plan part
the most important part of the plan?

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:42.541
A lotta people make that mistake.

00:33:48.708 --> 00:33:50.583
Back in Bali, that thing you said,

00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:53.916
about me and my father, how'd you know?

00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:58.625
I hate to break it to you,
but you're not a complex case.

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.208
The one thing
that doesn't quite line up for me is

00:34:01.291 --> 00:34:04.958
how the son of a Swiss police captain
turns to a life of high crime.

00:34:05.041 --> 00:34:06.083
Short version?

00:34:07.875 --> 00:34:11.833
My father was a prolific asshole.

00:34:12.791 --> 00:34:13.875
Long version?

00:34:15.333 --> 00:34:17.125
When I was eight years old,

00:34:18.916 --> 00:34:21.083
my dad thought I stole his watch.

00:34:21.666 --> 00:34:24.125
He loved that piece of metal
more than anything.

00:34:26.041 --> 00:34:29.000
He asked me if I stole it.
I told him I didn't.

00:34:29.791 --> 00:34:32.625
He said he knew that I had
and that I was lying.

00:34:33.291 --> 00:34:35.708
He didn't speak to me again after that.

00:34:35.791 --> 00:34:38.541
Not on Christmas. Not on my birthday.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:45.291
He went almost a full year,
just utter silence.

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.916
Like I didn't even exist.

00:34:50.583 --> 00:34:52.000
Then one night, he...

00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:56.750
He comes home
and he sits down at the dinner table...

00:34:58.625 --> 00:34:59.958
And there it is.

00:35:00.041 --> 00:35:02.250
There's the watch, the missing watch,

00:35:02.958 --> 00:35:04.541
right there on his wrist.

00:35:04.625 --> 00:35:07.416
Found out later that he put it
in his desk at work

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:10.208
and it got buried behind some papers
or something like that.

00:35:10.291 --> 00:35:12.500
But he never apologized. He just, uh...

00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.333
He just looked me in the eye
and said, "How was your day at school?"

00:35:18.958 --> 00:35:21.833
Then he kept askin',
"How was your day at school?"

00:35:21.916 --> 00:35:23.458
And I never answered him.

00:35:24.958 --> 00:35:27.458
I just stared at him.
I didn't eat. I didn't drink.

00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:31.083
Next week,
I found myself in boarding school.

00:35:34.458 --> 00:35:35.833
[snoring]

00:35:35.916 --> 00:35:36.916
Really?

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.041
[laughing]

00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:41.083
[inhales] I'm kidding.

00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.500
Hey.

00:35:44.916 --> 00:35:46.083
I'm sorry about all that.

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:49.958
Oh, no, no, no, no,
it's all right. [sniffs]

00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:51.750
You learn a valuable lesson, you know?

00:35:52.625 --> 00:35:54.166
It doesn't matter what you do,

00:35:56.125 --> 00:35:58.125
only matters what they think you've done.

00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:01.083
How about your old man?

00:36:02.708 --> 00:36:03.875
I don't talk about him.

00:36:03.958 --> 00:36:05.083
[Booth chuckles]

00:36:07.125 --> 00:36:08.125
That bad, huh?

00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:11.375
[suspenseful music playing]

00:36:22.333 --> 00:36:23.416
[Booth] Good news.

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:26.541
I slept like a baby after
our little therapy session last night.

00:36:27.041 --> 00:36:28.041
Better news,

00:36:28.375 --> 00:36:31.375
I've got our escape plan
down to a simple three-step process.

00:36:31.916 --> 00:36:33.750
All right, I'll bite.
What's the first step?

00:36:33.833 --> 00:36:36.208
- [whistles] Create a distraction.
- With soap?

00:36:36.875 --> 00:36:39.416
You know what happens
when you mix soap, which is pure glycerin,

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.291
with a cleaning solution
that's essentially nitric acid?

00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:44.416
- You get nitroglycerin.
- You get nitroglycerin.

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:45.375
We should run.

00:36:45.458 --> 00:36:47.375
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go.

00:36:47.458 --> 00:36:49.500
[machine whirring rapidly]

00:36:50.208 --> 00:36:51.541
[man grunts]

00:36:51.625 --> 00:36:54.166
[guards shouting in Russian]

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:55.833
[all grunting]

00:36:56.875 --> 00:36:58.000
[screams]

00:36:59.208 --> 00:37:01.000
- [guard 1 grunts]
- [guard 2 speaks Russian]

00:37:02.208 --> 00:37:03.666
[grunting continues]

00:37:09.416 --> 00:37:10.416
[all straining]

00:37:11.583 --> 00:37:12.583
[all grunting]

00:37:24.625 --> 00:37:27.583
[inmates clamoring]

00:37:30.541 --> 00:37:32.301
[in English]
It's locked. We need a key card.

00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:33.541
Step two, plan ahead.

00:37:33.625 --> 00:37:35.791
- Where'd you get that?
<i>- Nyet politsiya.</i>

00:37:36.291 --> 00:37:37.208
He's not a cop!

00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:38.416
[grunts]

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:50.625
[phone rings]

00:37:53.458 --> 00:37:54.916
What's the plan... Son of a bitch!

00:37:56.416 --> 00:37:59.041
- [in Russian] What? Understood.
- [indistinct chatter on phone]

00:38:03.625 --> 00:38:05.625
[in English] What are you doing?
What's step three?

00:38:05.666 --> 00:38:06.791
[shushes]

00:38:13.125 --> 00:38:14.166
[Booth] Step three...

00:38:16.166 --> 00:38:17.208
Rock Jenga.

00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:30.833
You first.

00:38:31.416 --> 00:38:33.958
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

00:38:34.041 --> 00:38:35.250
[in Russian] Get back!

00:38:35.333 --> 00:38:36.458
[gun cocking]

00:38:43.500 --> 00:38:44.500
This way.

00:38:52.166 --> 00:38:55.625
They're outside the walls.
Secure the perimeter.

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:57.291
[guards exclaiming in Russian]

00:39:10.583 --> 00:39:11.583
[Hartley grunting]

00:39:12.958 --> 00:39:15.416
[Booth exclaiming]

00:39:15.500 --> 00:39:16.750
[breathing heavily]

00:39:16.833 --> 00:39:18.291
[in English] Thank you. [panting]

00:39:18.375 --> 00:39:21.541
[breathing heavily]

00:39:22.166 --> 00:39:24.375
Okay. Okay.

00:39:39.833 --> 00:39:41.625
Can you fly a helicopter?

00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:44.083
Does the back of your head
look like a huge penis?

00:39:46.208 --> 00:39:47.791
The answer is yes!

00:39:48.291 --> 00:39:50.291
[Russian pop music playing]

00:39:55.916 --> 00:39:58.166
Oh, that's fun. This is my best friend.

00:39:58.875 --> 00:40:00.291
[guard grunts]

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.083
- We're not friends.
- We're best friends.

00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:05.873
- [in Russian] They're over here!
- [in English] Go!

00:40:20.458 --> 00:40:21.625
[grunts]

00:40:25.208 --> 00:40:26.875
I can't believe nobody saw that.

00:40:27.833 --> 00:40:28.875
[guards shouting]

00:40:28.958 --> 00:40:30.333
[in Russian] Here they are! Fire!

00:40:32.375 --> 00:40:33.500
[guards continue shouting]

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.041
[Booth in English] Okay.

00:40:42.125 --> 00:40:43.000
Oh.

00:40:43.083 --> 00:40:44.125
That's in Russian.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
[guards speaking indistinctly]

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.125
[guards shout]

00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.625
[in Russian] Go, he just has a pistol!

00:41:03.791 --> 00:41:05.250
[guards speaking indistinctly]

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.375
[guard] The forklift!

00:41:09.458 --> 00:41:11.833
[helicopter powering up]

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:22.291
[beeping]

00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:24.416
[gasps]

00:41:25.291 --> 00:41:28.666
[yelling]

00:41:30.333 --> 00:41:32.916
[grunting]

00:41:33.875 --> 00:41:35.000
[grunts, winces]

00:41:35.708 --> 00:41:36.708
Huh.

00:41:40.958 --> 00:41:42.166
[panting]

00:41:44.291 --> 00:41:46.000
[grunting]

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.416
[guards speaking indistinctly]

00:41:55.791 --> 00:41:57.541
[helicopter whirring]

00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:05.750
[guards speaking indistinctly]

00:42:10.125 --> 00:42:11.125
Uh-oh.

00:42:13.750 --> 00:42:15.041
[guards yelling]

00:42:30.750 --> 00:42:32.083
[in English] Son of a bitch.

00:42:36.375 --> 00:42:37.375
[in Russian] Reload!

00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:40.708
[in English] Shit.

00:42:48.291 --> 00:42:49.291
[grunts]

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.250
Oh, you made it. Thank God!

00:42:53.333 --> 00:42:54.666
[grunting]

00:42:54.750 --> 00:42:55.791
I was praying for you.

00:42:55.875 --> 00:42:57.958
Don't give me that shit.
You were gonna leave me?

00:42:59.125 --> 00:43:00.375
You said, "Save yourself."

00:43:00.458 --> 00:43:02.250
I said, "Go,"
but I didn't mean without me.

00:43:02.333 --> 00:43:04.416
You said, "Go save yourself."

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.500
And I was gonna carry you with me
in my heart like an eternal flame,

00:43:07.583 --> 00:43:08.791
you stupid complainer.

00:43:08.875 --> 00:43:09.750
[alarm beeping]

00:43:09.833 --> 00:43:11.291
[Booth] Why is that blinking?

00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.791
- [beeping intensifies]
- [Booth] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:43:20.958 --> 00:43:22.250
[Booth] Ooh! Incoming!

00:43:22.666 --> 00:43:23.666
[Hartley grunts]

00:43:28.458 --> 00:43:29.916
[panting]

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.416
[exclaiming in relief]

00:43:33.708 --> 00:43:35.875
[triumphant music playing]

00:43:39.125 --> 00:43:40.166
[exhales]

00:43:41.416 --> 00:43:43.583
[Hartley panting]

00:43:43.666 --> 00:43:45.708
See? Easy-peasy.

00:43:52.958 --> 00:43:55.583
[The Bishop] I know it sounds
like a tough childhood,

00:43:55.666 --> 00:43:57.916
but my father made me who I am today.

00:43:59.916 --> 00:44:01.541
Maybe that's my problem.

00:44:02.666 --> 00:44:07.250
I'm so focused on winning all the time,
on being the best at what I do,

00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:11.458
that I can never
just fully relax and just be.

00:44:13.625 --> 00:44:14.791
Is that normal?

00:44:15.458 --> 00:44:16.958
[muffled] How the fuck would I know?

00:44:22.916 --> 00:44:24.083
[The Bishop] What?

00:44:24.166 --> 00:44:26.958
I'm not a therapist.
I'm an intelligence analyst.

00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:28.041
I'm sorry.

00:44:29.458 --> 00:44:31.666
[sighs] I'm just dealing
with a lot right now

00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:33.833
and you seemed like
someone I could talk to.

00:44:34.333 --> 00:44:36.041
And it's so rare in my line of work

00:44:36.125 --> 00:44:38.333
to find someone
who's just there to listen.

00:44:38.958 --> 00:44:39.958
Thank you.

00:44:40.666 --> 00:44:44.333
Anyway, I'm sorry
to rope you into all of this,

00:44:44.416 --> 00:44:46.166
but just using your terminal here

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.625
to ensure that the origin point
of my message is untraceable.

00:44:49.708 --> 00:44:52.333
Best way to do it is
from within the system itself.

00:44:52.416 --> 00:44:55.791
They should really work on
patching the security vulnerability.

00:44:55.875 --> 00:44:56.916
It's embarrassing.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.875
Did you know that 99%
of all tracking protocols

00:44:59.958 --> 00:45:02.041
focus on third-party movements? [scoffs]

00:45:03.666 --> 00:45:07.291
No one ever expects the call
to come from inside the house, as it were.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:12.083
Hence, your computer, your office.

00:45:12.166 --> 00:45:13.916
Oh. Here we go.

00:45:14.625 --> 00:45:18.166
Just need to slow down my competition,
such as they are.

00:45:41.916 --> 00:45:44.375
I'm afraid that's
all the time we have for today.

00:45:44.875 --> 00:45:49.125
I'm gonna have to end our session here.
Have a lovely day.

00:45:49.208 --> 00:45:50.208
Freeze!

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.625
- [grunts, groans]
- [winces]

00:45:58.708 --> 00:45:59.833
[sighs] See?

00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:03.291
This is why we can't have nice things.

00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:07.125
'Cause the moment I trust someone,
they tap the foot alarm beneath their desk

00:46:07.208 --> 00:46:09.250
and then I'm forced
to do things like this.

00:46:10.166 --> 00:46:13.041
I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed.

00:46:13.125 --> 00:46:15.500
I really thought you were different.

00:46:16.416 --> 00:46:18.666
Well, fool me once...

00:46:20.958 --> 00:46:22.625
I'm gonna leave now and when he wakes up,

00:46:22.708 --> 00:46:25.333
you're going to tell him
that you triggered the alarm falsely

00:46:25.416 --> 00:46:28.041
and in his haste,
he tripped coming through the door.

00:46:28.875 --> 00:46:30.708
And if you decide not to do that,

00:46:31.333 --> 00:46:34.708
I want you to remember
one critically important thing.

00:46:35.416 --> 00:46:39.625
I know everyone you work with
and every member of your family.

00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.208
And I also know your browser history.

00:46:44.041 --> 00:46:45.881
- [clicks tongue]
- [dramatic musical flourish]

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.000
[aircraft whooshing]

00:46:50.083 --> 00:46:52.916
[triumphant music playing]

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.416
[both laughing]

00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:03.333
Nolan.

00:47:03.416 --> 00:47:05.666
Tambwe! Come on, bring it in.

00:47:06.458 --> 00:47:07.458
[Tambwe] Oh.

00:47:08.666 --> 00:47:10.416
I can't thank you enough for this.

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.625
I'm just glad
I could finally repay my debt to you.

00:47:12.708 --> 00:47:13.833
And now I'm in yours.

00:47:13.916 --> 00:47:15.291
[Tambwe laughs]

00:47:15.375 --> 00:47:16.726
- Come, everything is ready.
- Alright.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:18.309
- I have juice boxes.
- That's very good.

00:47:18.333 --> 00:47:21.708
Hey. Tambwe got us a costume change,
so we can get out of these filthy duds.

00:47:21.791 --> 00:47:22.875
Oh. I'm so sorry.

00:47:22.958 --> 00:47:26.000
Tambwe, this is Agent John Hartley

00:47:26.083 --> 00:47:29.291
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
It's a funny story.

00:47:29.375 --> 00:47:32.166
A lot of his colleagues have
put a lot of your colleagues in prison.

00:47:32.250 --> 00:47:33.250
It's exciting.

00:47:34.958 --> 00:47:36.125
No juice boxes for you.

00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:58.750
[exhales]

00:47:59.583 --> 00:48:00.750
Oh, I see.

00:48:00.833 --> 00:48:03.458
Nice jacket, while I "Gotta dance."

00:48:03.541 --> 00:48:06.083
All right, man.
Don't even start with me, okay?

00:48:06.166 --> 00:48:07.875
At least you're comfortable.

00:48:10.625 --> 00:48:12.958
Well, clearly you have
this whole thing figured out.

00:48:13.041 --> 00:48:16.041
- You wanna walk me through it?
- I do. Here's the deal.

00:48:16.125 --> 00:48:17.208
<i>During the party,</i>

00:48:17.291 --> 00:48:20.208
<i>the guests and the staff
are required to stay on the main floor,</i>

00:48:20.291 --> 00:48:21.851
<i>and upstairs, the door to the egg room,</i>

00:48:21.875 --> 00:48:24.541
<i>well, that's locked and heavily guarded.</i>

00:48:24.625 --> 00:48:27.083
But there's another way in.
Hidden entrance.

00:48:27.166 --> 00:48:28.375
<i>Here's what I'm thinkin'.</i>

00:48:28.458 --> 00:48:31.000
<i>We dress up in matching black pajamas</i>

00:48:31.083 --> 00:48:34.000
<i>and sneak past the featured extras
and into the bedroom.</i>

00:48:35.458 --> 00:48:39.625
<i>Then, we slip through the study
and get our hands on his precious.</i>

00:48:39.708 --> 00:48:42.708
- Is that the egg?
- [shushes]

00:48:42.791 --> 00:48:43.791
I'm sorry.

00:48:49.791 --> 00:48:51.333
- You are amazing.
- I know.

00:48:52.791 --> 00:48:53.791
Wow.

00:48:54.875 --> 00:48:56.291
- Hey, dickhead.
- Hmm?

00:48:56.375 --> 00:48:58.583
Your last brilliant plan
had some kinks in it.

00:48:58.666 --> 00:48:59.583
Mmm-hmm.

00:48:59.666 --> 00:49:01.916
So, what kinda security surveillance
are we looking at?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.291
Well, the guy's an arms dealer,

00:49:03.375 --> 00:49:06.416
so, you know, every square inch

00:49:14.541 --> 00:49:15.875

00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:32.791

things get a little tricky.</i>

00:49:32.875 --> 00:49:35.708

00:49:39.541 --> 00:49:42.666
<i>So you can't drill it
and you can't make it go boom.</i>

00:49:42.750 --> 00:49:45.583
<i>The only way through it
is with facial and voice recognition.</i>

00:49:45.666 --> 00:49:48.541
<i>And there's only one face
and one voice that opens it.</i>

00:49:49.041 --> 00:49:50.541
Sotto Voce.

00:49:50.625 --> 00:49:52.958
How are we gonna get
his voice and his facial?

00:49:53.041 --> 00:49:55.625
Well, first off,
a positive mental attitude helps.

00:49:56.125 --> 00:50:00.291
But so does some pretty kick-ass
deepfake technology.

00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:03.750
Spooky, right?

00:50:03.833 --> 00:50:05.958
If you have
more than 12 images on the Internet,

00:50:06.541 --> 00:50:09.958
I can send your mom
a video of you mouth-sexing a goat.

00:50:10.041 --> 00:50:13.416
I'm not saying I'm gonna do that,
I'm just saying I could if I wanted to.

00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:15.666
If I had enough time and enough pictures.

00:50:15.750 --> 00:50:16.791
[shutter clicking]

00:50:17.916 --> 00:50:20.000
But wait, there's more.

00:50:20.083 --> 00:50:24.333
<i>There's also a 12-digit randomly-generated

<i>and Sotto Voce's phone can only be found
in Sotto Voce's pants.</i>

00:50:30.583 --> 00:50:32.875
So, yeah, easy-peasy.

00:50:33.458 --> 00:50:35.658
Oh, no, no, no! There's one more thing.
Kinda important.

00:50:35.708 --> 00:50:40.875
We're gonna need his thumbprint 'cause
he never upgraded his iPhone -4, so...

00:50:40.958 --> 00:50:43.416
So if we don't get his thumbprint,
we can't get the egg.

00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.083
Oh, my God.

00:50:46.291 --> 00:50:48.875
You can learn. This is amazing.

00:50:48.958 --> 00:50:50.166
You are not sparkly enough.

00:50:50.250 --> 00:50:52.476
I'm gonna get you a matching vest
to go with those pants.

[Booth] Check, check. Roger Dodger.
What's your 20, free bird?

00:51:40.583 --> 00:51:43.166
You don't have to do that.
I'm standing right next to you.

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.250
I'm not used to using these stupid things,

00:51:45.333 --> 00:51:47.291
and I'm not used
to working with a partner.

00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:49.916
We're not partners.
This is a marriage of convenience.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.166
I want a divorce
and I'm keeping the kids.

00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:53.583
Let's just do this.

00:51:53.666 --> 00:51:56.833
I'll get the thumbprint,
you get Sotto Voce's phone.

We've got a party crasher.

00:52:32.291 --> 00:52:35.583
Yeah, it's no biggie. No biggie.
We knew she'd be here.

00:52:36.208 --> 00:52:37.750
We're here for the egg, not her.

00:52:37.833 --> 00:52:40.041
Speak for yourself. I'm going in.

00:52:40.791 --> 00:52:43.208
What are you doing?
That's not part of the plan.

00:52:43.291 --> 00:52:44.291
Plans change.

00:52:45.916 --> 00:52:46.916

00:52:50.625 --> 00:52:51.833
Beautiful.

00:52:55.875 --> 00:52:58.625
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

00:52:58.708 --> 00:53:01.791
It's just impossible for me
to tell who you are with that mask on.

00:53:03.833 --> 00:53:05.375
- How about now?
- [gasps theatrically]

00:53:05.458 --> 00:53:07.250
Agent Hartley!

00:53:09.375 --> 00:53:10.875
So it was you all along.

00:53:11.708 --> 00:53:13.708
Such a clever disguise.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.583
Well, I suppose you and Mr. Booth,
wherever he is,

00:53:18.666 --> 00:53:21.125
are here to try to beat me
to the second egg.

00:53:21.208 --> 00:53:23.791
<i>- Even the playing field.</i>
- Don't tell her anything.

00:53:23.875 --> 00:53:26.291
I'm not here for the egg.
I'm here to clear my name,

<i>which means all I need is you.</i>

00:53:27.625 --> 00:53:29.250
You're literally telling her everything.

We both know that this whole thing
is gonna end with you in handcuffs.

00:53:36.166 --> 00:53:39.125
Promises, promises.

00:53:48.541 --> 00:53:49.625
[sighs]

00:53:55.041 --> 00:53:57.583
Careful now. We don't wanna cause a scene.

00:53:57.666 --> 00:53:59.546
Don't care.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.083
Oh, good, you're dancing with her.

00:54:08.625 --> 00:54:10.708
Not bad for a convict.

00:54:10.791 --> 00:54:15.583
Speaking of which,
how's it going with your partner in crime?

00:54:15.666 --> 00:54:18.083
Has he told you
where the third egg is yet?

00:54:18.166 --> 00:54:20.041
Well, if he did, I wouldn't tell you.

00:54:21.250 --> 00:54:23.583
That's a no. He must not trust you.

00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:27.416
You trust your partner?

[The Bishop]
<i>What makes you think I have one?</i>

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:32.833
Well, no one would be able to pull off
the scores you have alone.

00:54:32.916 --> 00:54:34.083
It's impossible.

00:54:34.208 --> 00:54:35.208
[scoffs]

00:54:40.791 --> 00:54:42.041
So what now?

00:54:42.125 --> 00:54:44.083
You're gonna arrest me right here,

00:54:44.625 --> 00:54:48.416
without a badge or a gun,
outside of your jurisdiction,

00:54:49.375 --> 00:54:52.250
and in front of a room full of criminals?

00:54:54.625 --> 00:54:56.666
Is that your plan, Agent Hartley?

00:54:56.791 --> 00:54:57.791
[laughs]

00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.583
Shit!

00:55:06.666 --> 00:55:09.291
[Booth] <i>Incoming! Got the print.
Get the hell out of there.</i>

00:55:11.916 --> 00:55:15.333
Or perhaps you just
didn't think this all the way through.

00:55:18.833 --> 00:55:21.416
You're coming with me. Party's over.

[Sotto Voce clears throat]

00:55:28.208 --> 00:55:31.583
Watching you dance with this man
at my party has made me quite jealous.

00:55:31.666 --> 00:55:33.875
Well, I had to get your attention somehow.

00:55:35.666 --> 00:55:36.708
Didn't I?

00:55:38.375 --> 00:55:39.375
May I?

00:55:40.333 --> 00:55:41.916
Like you said, it's your party.

00:55:46.708 --> 00:55:47.708
Apologies.

00:55:51.375 --> 00:55:52.541
We needed to get his phone,

00:55:52.625 --> 00:55:54.833
not waste time
playing footsie with The Bishop.

00:55:54.916 --> 00:55:57.458
Don't worry. I got it.

00:55:58.458 --> 00:55:59.625
Excuse me.

00:56:00.500 --> 00:56:02.958
You're kidding. Nice pull!

00:56:03.041 --> 00:56:04.750
How'd you know Sotto Voce would cut in?

00:56:04.833 --> 00:56:09.458
Well, Sotto Voce is a 5'5" alpha male
with textbook Napoleon complex.

00:56:09.541 --> 00:56:13.666
So any time another male dances with
the most desirable woman at his party,

00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:17.666
well, he has no choice
but to step in and assert his dominance.

00:56:18.208 --> 00:56:19.708
You sneaky little minx.

00:56:19.791 --> 00:56:21.708
Where'd you learn that? Profiler school?

00:56:21.791 --> 00:56:22.791
High school.

00:56:32.541 --> 00:56:35.500
[song ends]

00:56:42.916 --> 00:56:44.041
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:56:45.083 --> 00:56:49.958
it is my sincere pleasure
to welcome you all to my humble home.

00:56:50.041 --> 00:56:52.375
- [crowd chuckle]
- Now's the time. He's speechifying.

00:56:52.458 --> 00:56:54.184

was a man of conviction...

00:57:02.708 --> 00:57:04.791
Oh! Terribly, terribly sorry, sir.

00:57:05.375 --> 00:57:06.416
You imbecile!

00:57:06.958 --> 00:57:09.416
- Oh...
- Don't put your hands on me, peasant.

00:57:10.083 --> 00:57:13.000
[in Spanish] I'm so sorry, sir.
[in English] A thousand apologies.

00:57:13.083 --> 00:57:15.458
I don't need your apologies,
I need a washroom.

00:57:15.541 --> 00:57:16.541
Take him.

00:57:17.125 --> 00:57:18.375
Right this way, sir.

00:57:18.458 --> 00:57:20.208
[whispers] Let's get you hosed down.

00:57:20.291 --> 00:57:24.333
[Sotto Voce] This pistol
was my father's prized possession.

00:57:24.416 --> 00:57:27.583
I've kept it close to my heart
since the day I killed him with it.

00:57:27.666 --> 00:57:30.541
I was never permitted
to touch this as a boy.

00:57:30.625 --> 00:57:31.625
[Booth] Right this way.

What's going on there?

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:44.083

[speech continues indistinctly]

00:58:01.458 --> 00:58:03.333
Something's off. I'm calling it in anyway.

00:58:03.416 --> 00:58:07.000
Don't be an idiot.

No, no, no, no, no.

00:59:24.833 --> 00:59:26.041
We gotta go.

00:59:48.041 --> 00:59:50.250

Oh, my God!

You're like a well-dressed wall.

00:59:57.541 --> 00:59:58.583
What are you doing?

00:59:58.666 --> 00:59:59.750
Trying to ruin the mission.

00:59:59.833 --> 01:00:02.166
Well, mission accomplished.
Find the print.

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:03.250
God damn it!

01:00:03.875 --> 01:00:07.166
Come on, come on, come on,
you little bastard. Where are you?

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Shit!

01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:20.625
Gotcha.

Okay, it's deepfake time.

Sotto Voce.

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:05.125
Right.

01:01:08.250 --> 01:01:10.410
[in Spanish] I thought
Mr. Voce was still at the party?

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.750
Send a team.

01:01:14.416 --> 01:01:17.166
Security, we have a code red.

01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:21.125
[Das in English] Hey!

01:01:24.625 --> 01:01:26.458
You know,
for a guy who claims he's innocent,

01:01:26.541 --> 01:01:28.916
you sure do hang around
with a lot of criminals.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.375
I am innocent.

01:01:30.458 --> 01:01:32.791
He's a pretty damn good thief
for his first time.

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:34.392
- I'm not good at it.
- [Booth] You are.

01:01:34.416 --> 01:01:36.101
- Don't say that.
- Don't sell yourself short.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:37.684
- Shut up.
- Hector Deflector over here.

01:01:37.708 --> 01:01:39.333
He's not good at taking a compliment.

01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:42.625
I need you to understand,
The Bishop is behind this entire thing.

01:01:42.708 --> 01:01:43.708
She set me up.

01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:47.666
Well, if this is all The Bishop's doing
and you really are innocent, prove it.

01:01:48.916 --> 01:01:52.208
Go on, detain your friend.

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:53.333
We're not friends.

01:01:53.416 --> 01:01:55.291
- We're work wives.
- We're not work wives.

01:01:55.375 --> 01:01:57.267
- We're sister wives.
- We're not any kind of wives.

01:01:57.291 --> 01:01:58.416
Shut up! Both of you.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.125
You either arrest him
or I arrest you both.

01:02:03.833 --> 01:02:06.041
What's it gonna be, Agent Hartley?

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.041
- I'm sorry, man.
- Oh...

01:02:13.666 --> 01:02:14.875
Oh, come on!

01:02:14.958 --> 01:02:16.601
- You're under arrest.
- You're gonna listen?

01:02:16.625 --> 01:02:18.500
After all we've been through together...

01:02:25.625 --> 01:02:26.791
[whispers] I hate you.

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:30.666
- [in normal voice] Tight enough? Jesus!
- [sighs] See?

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.333
I'm a good guy.

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.291
But sometimes I do bad things.

[Booth grunts]

01:02:40.833 --> 01:02:43.166
- Hartley!
- Let's grab that egg and get out of here.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:45.050
You don't wanna talk
about what just happened?

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:46.767
- What you talking about?
- We had a moment.

01:02:46.791 --> 01:02:49.333
- We didn't have a moment.
- No, we had a moment.

01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.583

01:03:06.875 --> 01:03:08.916
You look awful.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:13.041
Hmm. You know, there was an easier way in,

01:03:13.125 --> 01:03:16.208
but I doubt very much
that you could've managed it.

01:03:16.291 --> 01:03:17.458
[Booth scoffs]

01:03:17.541 --> 01:03:20.791
Now that I have two out of the three eggs,

01:03:22.666 --> 01:03:25.958
I'll give you one last chance
to take me up on my offer.

01:03:26.583 --> 01:03:28.684
- Well, here's my counteroffer.
- [The Bishop] Mm-hmm.

01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:30.125
- You're under arrest.
- Oh, my God.

01:03:30.208 --> 01:03:31.375
Read the room.

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:35.958
I told you, this would end
with you in handcuffs.

01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:38.541
You're so embarrassing.
He's so embarrassing.

01:03:39.458 --> 01:03:41.125
Tell you what, Agent Hartley.

01:03:43.083 --> 01:03:44.083
You wanna arrest me?

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:46.000
Come...

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:49.833
Arrest me.

01:03:50.583 --> 01:03:52.833
I just want the egg. So, uh...

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.208

This is easy.

Sir, we have a problem in the vault room.

01:05:15.458 --> 01:05:16.458
Excuse me.

01:05:16.541 --> 01:05:17.875

Bro, I didn't...
I didn't see the handcuffs coming.

01:06:05.291 --> 01:06:06.916
Mm, was a nice touch.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.166
God, this is such a confusing erection.

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:10.809
You can't ever tell anybody about this.

01:06:10.833 --> 01:06:13.233
- [Booth] I'll never tell anybody. Promise.
- [Hartley] Okay.

01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:17.916
[footsteps approaching]

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:18.833
[Booth] Okay.

01:06:18.916 --> 01:06:21.750
Oh, whoa, hold on, hold on.
No, don't shoot.

01:06:22.750 --> 01:06:25.750
I'm not trying to be a tattletale.
We didn't steal your egg, okay?

01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:27.041
I mean, we tried.

01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:28.958
But she got it.

01:06:29.666 --> 01:06:31.208
[Hartley] He's telling you the truth.

01:06:31.708 --> 01:06:32.875
Is that so?

01:06:35.125 --> 01:06:37.708
Thank you. Oh. All right.

01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:46.958
Would you like to make
a confession, my lady?

01:06:49.125 --> 01:06:51.166
It's a pleasure doing business with you.

01:06:51.750 --> 01:06:53.250
I told you they'd come.

01:06:58.291 --> 01:06:59.625
[laughing] Oh, ho, ho, ho.

01:06:59.708 --> 01:07:01.083

01:07:26.666 --> 01:07:28.541
[both breathing heavily]

01:07:28.625 --> 01:07:32.291
Down here, beneath the bulls,
no one will hear your screams.

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:34.291
[exhales] That's called foreshadowing.

01:07:34.375 --> 01:07:35.976
- I know what it's called.
- Was making sure.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
You don't look like an English major.

01:07:38.083 --> 01:07:40.875
- Shut up.
<i>- Buongiorno, </i>everybody!

01:07:40.958 --> 01:07:43.208
- Perfect!
- [sing-song] I brought champagne.

01:07:43.291 --> 01:07:45.750
I would introduce you,
but I believe you've already met

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:47.250
my lovely business associate.

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:48.166
[Booth] Yes.

01:07:48.250 --> 01:07:50.291
I told you The Bishop
was working with somebody.

01:07:50.375 --> 01:07:52.541
It's a marriage of convenience.

01:07:52.625 --> 01:07:55.416
You're familiar with that concept,
aren't you?

01:07:56.666 --> 01:07:59.708
You see, the dashing Mr. Voce here

01:07:59.791 --> 01:08:02.125
already held the second egg
in his possession.

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:05.000
So, I approached him with my own offer,

01:08:05.083 --> 01:08:07.458
which brings us to the part

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:12.166
where you tell us where the third egg is.

01:08:13.416 --> 01:08:15.958
[both laugh]

01:08:20.083 --> 01:08:21.958
Piss off for a thousand years.

01:08:23.208 --> 01:08:25.916
Oh, bummer.
I really wanted to do it the easy way.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:31.625
That's okay. I'll get the information
from you by hurting him.

01:08:33.083 --> 01:08:34.208
I'm sorry, what?

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:35.666
I love this plan.

01:08:39.041 --> 01:08:41.333
[The Bishop] You two share a special bond.

01:08:41.416 --> 01:08:43.833
Otherwise, why would you
risk your lives together

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:45.250
attempting to steal the egg?

01:08:45.333 --> 01:08:48.125
Isn't that right, Agent Hartley?

01:08:48.208 --> 01:08:50.875
There is no bond between us.
I barely know the guy.

01:08:50.958 --> 01:08:52.916
Booth, tell her we're not friends.

01:08:54.791 --> 01:08:56.791
- She knows about us, pal.
- That's bullshit.

01:08:56.875 --> 01:08:59.250
She knows about our special bond,
that you were my best man.

01:08:59.333 --> 01:09:00.413
Son of a bitch. He's lying.

01:09:00.958 --> 01:09:04.000
If she hurts you bad enough,
if she gets really creative with it,

01:09:04.083 --> 01:09:06.208
I'm gonna have no choice
but to tell her everything.

01:09:07.041 --> 01:09:11.333
Now, Mr. Booth, where is the third egg?

01:09:12.916 --> 01:09:15.583
Okay, here I go.

01:09:15.666 --> 01:09:17.250
[lazily] No, don't. Wait.

[Hartley] No.

01:09:32.916 --> 01:09:36.625
I guess now we find out what kind
of friend you really are, Mr. Booth,

01:09:36.708 --> 01:09:39.416

to my favorite place.

I'll tell you, all right?

- It's in Egypt.
- [The Bishop] Where in Egypt?

01:10:38.833 --> 01:10:40.934
[Booth] There's a hidden chamber
in the Great Pyramid.

01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:43.416
Lidar discovered it a year ago.
They haven't opened it yet.

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:46.833
- How do you know the egg is there?
- My mother was an Egyptologist.

01:10:46.916 --> 01:10:49.333
I could read hieroglyphics

01:10:49.875 --> 01:10:52.000
That hidden chamber

01:10:53.166 --> 01:10:56.166

01:10:56.750 --> 01:10:59.791
They buried the third egg there
when the other two went missing.

01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:02.416
The scans show it
sitting there plain as day.

01:11:04.666 --> 01:11:06.250
The third egg never left Egypt.

01:11:08.958 --> 01:11:11.791
He's not lying. I read about the chamber.

01:11:14.291 --> 01:11:15.666

Not without me.

01:13:55.916 --> 01:13:58.333
I got a pretty good idea
where she's going because of you.

01:13:58.416 --> 01:14:00.541
- So, goodbye.
- I lied.

01:14:05.333 --> 01:14:07.000
- I lied.
- What do you mean, "you lied"?

01:14:07.083 --> 01:14:09.142
I lied about everything.
All of it. That whole thing.

01:14:09.166 --> 01:14:12.000
I lied to you, I lied to her,
I lied to Baby Jesus.

01:14:12.791 --> 01:14:13.791
All of 'em.

01:14:15.458 --> 01:14:20.750
Look, the point is,
is that the third egg isn't in Egypt.

01:14:20.833 --> 01:14:22.541
Right. I don't give a shit about the egg.

01:14:22.625 --> 01:14:25.416
I care about arresting The Bishop
and clearing my name.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:28.583
Right. But you won't get to The Bishop
unless you get to the egg.

01:14:28.666 --> 01:14:30.250
And I know where the egg is.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:32.291
Just get me out of here.

01:14:32.375 --> 01:14:34.500
I'll get the egg
and you'll get The Bishop.

01:14:35.916 --> 01:14:36.916
Come on!

01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:40.416
[softly] Pretty please?

01:14:46.083 --> 01:14:47.083
Thoughts?

01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:49.166
[crowd cheering]

01:14:49.250 --> 01:14:50.250
You hear that?

01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:56.833
[yells]

01:14:56.916 --> 01:14:58.166
[breathing heavily]

01:15:00.750 --> 01:15:01.750
Hey, hey, hey.

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:03.666
Up here.

01:15:04.125 --> 01:15:07.000
We'll disappear into the crowd.
We'll be home free.

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:09.083
[ominous music playing]

01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:13.208
[crowd cheering]

01:15:15.208 --> 01:15:17.583
[indistinct chatter]

01:15:22.083 --> 01:15:23.458
[bellows]

01:15:23.541 --> 01:15:24.916
Oh, shit!

01:15:25.791 --> 01:15:28.291
I think we're gonna get out of here.

01:15:28.833 --> 01:15:30.125
[exclaims] Shit!

01:15:35.458 --> 01:15:37.666
- No, no. Don't move. Don't move.
- Why?

01:15:37.750 --> 01:15:40.708
Bulls have terrible eyesight.
But they can sense motion.

01:15:40.791 --> 01:15:42.208
You're thinking of <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

01:15:42.291 --> 01:15:45.708
No! I saw a nature documentary
starring David Attenborough.

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:48.958
You're thinking of Richard Attenborough
from <i>Jurassic Park.</i>

01:15:49.041 --> 01:15:50.916
[all yelling in Spanish]

01:15:53.083 --> 01:15:56.083
<i>Vámonos. Vámonos.</i>
They're telling me to run.

01:15:56.166 --> 01:15:58.125
If you run, you die.

01:15:58.208 --> 01:15:59.541
[snorting]

01:16:00.791 --> 01:16:02.666
All right, yes or no,
was Jeff Goldblum in it?

01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:05.750
Oh, my God! It was <i>Jurassic Park.</i>
That's Jeff Goldblum.

01:16:05.833 --> 01:16:06.750
Asshole!

01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.208
- [bull snorts]
- [grunts]

01:16:08.291 --> 01:16:10.083
- [groans]
- [crowd gasps]

01:16:13.083 --> 01:16:15.333
[Booth] Run, run, run, run, run
or you will die!

01:16:15.416 --> 01:16:16.791
[bellowing]

01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.041
A-ha... [grunts]

01:16:27.958 --> 01:16:29.541
[crowd cheering]

01:16:29.625 --> 01:16:30.791
Ah.

01:16:32.166 --> 01:16:33.291
Thank you!

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:38.333
What's your problem?

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.000
Don't run?

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:41.958
Don't run?

01:16:43.166 --> 01:16:45.046
[Booth] You gonna be
this grumpy the whole trip?

01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:47.166
Wait till you see our ride.
You're gonna love it.

01:16:56.208 --> 01:16:58.750
This is fun, isn't it?

01:16:58.833 --> 01:17:01.000
Riding the rails hobo-style.

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:04.166
You ever see, um, uh, <i>Sullivan's Travels?</i>

01:17:04.666 --> 01:17:05.708
No, I haven't.

01:17:05.791 --> 01:17:07.833
And no, it's not, all right? Cough it up.

01:17:07.916 --> 01:17:09.708
Where are we headed?
Where's the third egg?

01:17:09.791 --> 01:17:11.416
All right, fine.

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.041
I've been thinking about this a lot,
and I can't tell you.

01:17:15.750 --> 01:17:17.208
What do you mean, you can't tell me?

01:17:17.291 --> 01:17:20.083
It's not so much of a "can't,"
it's more of a "won't."

01:17:21.458 --> 01:17:22.458
[exclaims]

01:17:23.916 --> 01:17:25.375
Take me to the third egg, Booth.

01:17:25.458 --> 01:17:26.958
[train horn blowing]

01:17:31.125 --> 01:17:32.125
You wanna do it?

01:17:32.166 --> 01:17:33.416
[suspenseful music playing]

01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:34.541
Do it.

01:17:35.416 --> 01:17:36.583
You can't, can you?

01:17:37.125 --> 01:17:40.000
'Cause even though you're
running around with me, playing the thief,

01:17:40.958 --> 01:17:42.916
you're not a real bad guy, Bubba.

01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:49.458
[suspenseful music builds]

01:17:49.541 --> 01:17:51.166
[Booth screams]

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:56.833
Let's get something straight right now.

01:17:58.250 --> 01:17:59.416
That was terrifying.

01:18:00.708 --> 01:18:03.791
Look, it's not that
I don't care about you.

01:18:03.875 --> 01:18:06.041
It's that I don't care about anyone.

01:18:08.458 --> 01:18:09.458
My dad was a crook.

01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:13.083
A con man, actually.

01:18:13.166 --> 01:18:15.291
[emotional music playing]

01:18:15.375 --> 01:18:16.375
He was the best.

01:18:17.708 --> 01:18:20.833
Then on my 13th birthday,
he didn't show up.

01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:23.291
My mom and I never saw him again.

01:18:27.916 --> 01:18:28.916
Wow.

01:18:30.916 --> 01:18:32.916
We really got some dads, huh?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:35.041
It's a miracle we're not both strippers.

01:18:35.125 --> 01:18:36.833
[chuckles] Yeah.

01:18:36.916 --> 01:18:39.250
[chuckles]

01:18:40.541 --> 01:18:43.666
Look, your dad was a cop,
so you became a crook.

01:18:44.291 --> 01:18:46.583
My dad was a crook, so I became a cop.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.500
We're not that different.

01:18:49.166 --> 01:18:51.291
I'm not asking you
to care about me, Booth.

01:18:52.416 --> 01:18:53.791
I'm asking you to help me.

01:18:54.666 --> 01:18:58.625
Help me catch The Bishop
and clear my name,

01:18:58.708 --> 01:19:02.916
and I will help you become the number one
art thief in the world again.

01:19:04.875 --> 01:19:07.250
It's the only chance I have
to get my life back.

01:19:08.458 --> 01:19:09.458
Please.

01:19:18.833 --> 01:19:21.791
April, 1945.

01:19:25.125 --> 01:19:27.625
<i>The Red Army's at the gate,
days from taking Berlin.</i>

01:19:28.208 --> 01:19:30.041
<i>It's game over for the Nazis,</i>

01:19:30.125 --> 01:19:33.416
<i>and that's when a forgotten Mr. Nobody
named Rudolph Zeich,</i>

01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:36.166
<i>Hitler's personal
art and antiquities dealer,</i>

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:39.916
<i>and the only man ever rumored
to have held Cleopatra's third egg</i>

<i>in his hands,</i>

01:19:41.666 --> 01:19:45.583
<i>hopped a steamer ship
and fled Germany for Argentina.</i>

01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:48.333
<i>The manifest shows
he traveled with just a single suitcase.</i>

01:19:48.416 --> 01:19:55.333
<i>Oh, and sixteen five-ton cargo containers
logged only as holding machine parts.</i>

01:19:57.375 --> 01:20:00.291
<i>Now, why would an art dealer
leave his patron's side</i>

01:20:00.375 --> 01:20:01.815
<i>and travel halfway around the globe,</i>

01:20:01.875 --> 01:20:06.041
<i>with nearly 100 tons
of so-called machine parts?</i>

01:20:07.208 --> 01:20:10.208
<i>For 70 years,
amateur sleuths, treasure hunters,</i>

01:20:10.291 --> 01:20:14.083
<i>and adult virgins everywhere
became obsessed with this question,</i>

01:20:15.041 --> 01:20:20.208
<i>obsessed with finding what they believed
had to be Hitler's lost bunker,</i>

01:20:20.291 --> 01:20:23.083
<i>hidden somewhere in South America.</i>

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.583
<i>And my dad was one of them.</i>

01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:30.583
<i>He'd spend weekends
holed up in his office,</i>

01:20:30.666 --> 01:20:33.375
<i>poring over old maps
and declassified files.</i>

01:20:34.583 --> 01:20:37.708
<i>Holidays, he'd drive hours away
to obscure auctions,</i>

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:39.958
<i>where he'd bid on the strangest things.</i>

01:20:42.666 --> 01:20:45.666
<i>Including a watch.</i>

01:20:48.291 --> 01:20:54.583
<i>And not just any watch.
Creepy Nazi art guy Rudolph Zeich's watch.</i>

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:58.791
<i>That same watch
my father chose to love more than me.</i>

01:20:58.875 --> 01:21:00.958
<i>What a dick.</i>

01:21:04.750 --> 01:21:07.000
<i>Never wanted anything to do
with his treasure hunt,</i>

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:08.458
<i>even after he passed.</i>

01:21:09.583 --> 01:21:11.958
<i>That was my father's thing,
and he could have it.</i>

01:21:20.666 --> 01:21:23.916
<i>But when I discovered what was inside it,</i>

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:28.916
<i>I knew right then that I held in my hand</i>

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.750
<i>the secret to the third egg's location.</i>

01:22:02.250 --> 01:22:04.625
[Hartley] Booth,
you've had me traveling for three days

01:22:04.708 --> 01:22:07.125
and hiking in circles for eight hours.

01:22:07.208 --> 01:22:08.750
That map better be right.

01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:11.000
[Booth] Relax, we'll find it.

01:22:11.083 --> 01:22:12.750
[Hartley] Say we find it.

01:22:12.833 --> 01:22:14.916
How can you be sure
the egg is actually there?

01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:18.166
- [Booth] What do you mean?
- I get that Rudolph the red-nosed Nazi guy

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:21.166
is rumored to be the last person
to ever hold the egg in his hands,

01:22:21.250 --> 01:22:25.666
and that this mystery bunker is rumored
to have all this stolen treasure.

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:28.708
How can you be sure
the third egg itself is actually there?

01:22:28.791 --> 01:22:29.791
Faith.

01:22:31.916 --> 01:22:32.750
Faith?

01:22:32.833 --> 01:22:34.291
I'm sorry, I just wanna be clear.

01:22:34.375 --> 01:22:37.541
So we're out in the middle of nowhere
based on faith?

01:22:38.083 --> 01:22:40.458
Or "gut vibe" if you're
not into the whole religious thing.

01:22:40.541 --> 01:22:41.541
No.

01:22:41.875 --> 01:22:44.708
You know, the kinda thing I'm into
is a good plan.

01:22:44.791 --> 01:22:47.083
A smart plan, the opposite of this.

01:22:47.166 --> 01:22:50.250
Relax. I have good news.
If I'm reading this map right...

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:52.666
We're here.

01:22:52.750 --> 01:22:54.083
- We're where?
- We've arrived.

01:22:54.166 --> 01:22:55.208
X marks the spot.

01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:58.041
X... What spot? X marks the spot.

01:22:58.125 --> 01:23:00.416
We're here. Here it is. Great job!

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.875
- Please don't yell at me.
- You found it! Booth found it.

01:23:02.958 --> 01:23:04.750
There's no bunker. There's shit here.

01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:07.017
- I'm just telling you what the map says.
- There's no bunker.

01:23:07.041 --> 01:23:08.416
Tell me, what does the map say?

01:23:09.208 --> 01:23:11.125
Oh, shit!

01:23:13.166 --> 01:23:14.916
Yeah, it's gonna be a long walk back.

01:23:15.958 --> 01:23:17.875
You know what I blame?
I blame the compass.

01:23:17.958 --> 01:23:20.541
I got this thing back in Scouts.
It's been a little wonky.

01:23:20.625 --> 01:23:22.208
It was never my strong suit.

01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:23.476
- Can I see this?
- Absolutely.

01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:24.708
- Can I see this?
- Of course.

01:23:26.375 --> 01:23:27.415
I see what the problem is.

01:23:28.125 --> 01:23:29.916
- That's the problem.
- Oh. That is not kind.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.640
You know what's not kind?
Dragging me out in the middle of nowhere,

01:23:32.666 --> 01:23:35.166
halfway around the world,
based on a goddamn hunch!

01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:36.458
[metal clangs]

[triumphant music playing]

01:24:29.916 --> 01:24:31.000
[Booth] Holy shit!

01:24:44.708 --> 01:24:46.708
[Booth whistling "The Raiders March"]

01:24:51.125 --> 01:24:52.125
[whistling stops]

01:25:00.583 --> 01:25:02.583
Guess they're paying the utilities.

01:25:04.291 --> 01:25:06.041
It's gotta be hydroelectric power,

01:25:06.791 --> 01:25:09.083
which means there's
running water somewhere down here.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.750
Look at that door.
Nothing hiding behind there.

01:25:19.708 --> 01:25:21.291
How are we gonna get through this?

01:25:24.791 --> 01:25:28.041
Oh, shit!

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:32.375
You have got to be kidding.

01:25:38.458 --> 01:25:39.833
Is that your father's watch?

01:25:39.916 --> 01:25:43.083
No. It's the watch from <i>Pulp Fiction.</i>

01:25:43.666 --> 01:25:45.375
Yes, it's my father's watch.

01:25:46.083 --> 01:25:49.458
- I thought you said you smashed it.
- I had it repaired. Is that a problem?

01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:52.125
No, it's not a problem.
Glad you're not touchy about it.

01:25:52.208 --> 01:25:53.208
Please shut up.

01:25:56.416 --> 01:25:57.250
[clangs]

01:25:57.333 --> 01:25:59.250
Uh, fun with magnets. All right.

01:26:02.500 --> 01:26:04.875

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:12.833
Dad...

01:26:15.333 --> 01:26:16.875
Please be good crazy.

01:26:21.416 --> 01:26:24.166
- [clicking]
- [dull thud]

01:26:24.250 --> 01:26:26.500
- [chains rattling]
- [metal thudding]

01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:29.750
[thudding stops]

01:26:40.791 --> 01:26:42.208
[both grunting]

01:27:19.833 --> 01:27:22.208
Forget the egg,
let's just steal this stuff.

01:27:22.291 --> 01:27:24.166
[Hartley]
We're not here to steal anything.

01:27:24.250 --> 01:27:27.375
Uh, actually we are.
We're here to steal the egg.

01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:28.698
[Hartley] You know what I mean.

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:32.083
[Booth] Oh, I steal it, it's stealing,
and you steal it, it's what?

01:27:32.166 --> 01:27:34.250
How about we just shut up?
And by we, I mean you.

01:27:34.333 --> 01:27:35.791
[Booth] You're also rude too.

01:27:36.833 --> 01:27:38.666
Rude to boot.

01:27:39.708 --> 01:27:41.541
[Hartley] How are we gonna find this egg?

01:27:41.625 --> 01:27:42.833
[Booth] I don't know.

01:27:43.375 --> 01:27:45.750
Look for a box that says "MacGuffin."

01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:03.791
Oh!

01:28:03.875 --> 01:28:05.333
Do you know what this is?

01:28:05.833 --> 01:28:07.708
This is...

01:28:07.791 --> 01:28:12.875
Yes, this is
a 1931 Mercedes-Benz Grosser 770.

01:28:13.541 --> 01:28:16.041
I could flip this for $25 million, easy.

01:28:16.125 --> 01:28:18.625
There's, like, three of these left
on the planet. Four!

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:21.000
There's four now.

01:28:21.083 --> 01:28:22.458
Three quarter-inch steel,

01:28:22.541 --> 01:28:25.125
reinforced armor-plating,
bullet-resistant glass,

01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:27.625
and a 24-karat gold inlay.

01:28:28.208 --> 01:28:29.833
This is a convertible tank.

01:28:29.916 --> 01:28:32.833
And it's in mint condition.
I bet you this thing still runs.

01:28:32.916 --> 01:28:34.750
Too bad it was driven by Nazi scum.

01:28:34.833 --> 01:28:36.392
It's a shame we're gonna have to burn it.

01:28:36.416 --> 01:28:38.250
How did they get it down here anyway?

01:28:38.333 --> 01:28:41.416
They carry it down the stairs
in tiny pieces and reassemble?

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:42.500
Through there.

01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:47.416
Place must have been built off
one of those old copper mines.

01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:50.208
The shafts down here are massive
and go on for miles.

01:28:50.791 --> 01:28:53.958
Build the bunker, bring in the loot,
seal the shaft...

01:28:54.041 --> 01:28:55.083
Bob's your uncle.

01:28:55.625 --> 01:28:57.000
Who's your daddy?

01:28:57.083 --> 01:28:58.708
[Hartley] That's not how it goes.

01:28:58.791 --> 01:28:59.875
[Booth] I know.

01:29:04.125 --> 01:29:08.458
Well, labels, Nazis, dum-dums.

01:29:13.583 --> 01:29:15.750
[Booth guffawing]

01:29:15.833 --> 01:29:19.000
[triumphant music playing]

01:29:22.916 --> 01:29:23.916
[clangs]

01:29:28.875 --> 01:29:29.875
Five-second rule.

01:29:29.916 --> 01:29:33.791
It's fine. Totally fine.
Not a scratch on it.

01:29:33.875 --> 01:29:36.625
Are you sure you don't wanna
flip this one? I got a guy.

01:29:36.708 --> 01:29:38.416
Let me save you the trouble.

01:29:39.458 --> 01:29:40.666
[sighs]

01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:42.916
Your entrances are bullshit.

01:29:43.000 --> 01:29:44.375
Egypt? [scoffs]

01:29:45.041 --> 01:29:48.458
Did you really think I ran right off
to the pyramids on your good word?

01:29:48.541 --> 01:29:51.500
All I had to do was wait for you two
to escape from Sotto Voce,

01:29:51.583 --> 01:29:53.750
and you led me right to the third egg,

01:29:53.833 --> 01:29:55.875
which I'm going to take from you now.

01:29:56.666 --> 01:29:59.333
So, uh, hand it over.

01:30:00.375 --> 01:30:01.916
Come on, don't be shy.

01:30:05.083 --> 01:30:07.583
[mockingly] Good job. Attaboy.

01:30:08.375 --> 01:30:09.625
- [door opens]
- [cocks gun]

01:30:09.708 --> 01:30:10.833
Drop your weapon!

01:30:13.541 --> 01:30:14.875
[rapid gunshots]

01:30:14.958 --> 01:30:16.791
[in Spanish] This way! On that side.

01:30:20.625 --> 01:30:22.291
[in English] How did she find us?

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:24.791
I followed you. She must have followed me.

01:30:26.833 --> 01:30:27.833
No shit!

01:30:31.041 --> 01:30:33.517
Why are you shooting at them?
I thought you were on their side.

01:30:33.541 --> 01:30:35.666
I am on their side. They shot at me first.

01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.166
How are we gonna get out of here?

01:30:41.916 --> 01:30:42.916
We take that.

01:30:43.416 --> 01:30:45.583
I don't think that's
gonna make it up the stairs.

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:48.500
- [cocks gun]
- It ain't going up the stairs.

01:30:50.291 --> 01:30:51.291
Cover us.

01:30:53.458 --> 01:30:55.208
[officers shouting]

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:03.458
[engine cranks]

01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:09.416
- Go, go, go!
- I'm trying!

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:10.500
Let's go.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.916
- [engine starts]
- Huh? Ha-ha!

01:31:21.208 --> 01:31:23.000
[officers shouting in Spanish]

01:31:29.833 --> 01:31:30.833
Let's go!

01:31:33.208 --> 01:31:34.375
- Throw it.
- What?

01:31:34.458 --> 01:31:35.458
Now!

01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:49.226
[Das in Spanish]
You two with me, the rest of you follow.

01:31:49.250 --> 01:31:50.250
Go!

01:31:52.625 --> 01:31:53.958
[engines revving]

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:14.250
[in English] I'm all out.

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.708
[grunts]

01:32:33.916 --> 01:32:35.416
[in Spanish] Pull over!

01:32:37.083 --> 01:32:38.083
[grunts]

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:40.625
[both grunting]

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:47.125
[tires screeching]

01:32:55.833 --> 01:32:57.500
- [male officer] Shit!
- [engine revving]

01:32:59.666 --> 01:33:00.833
[exclaims]

01:33:02.958 --> 01:33:03.958
Whoa!

01:33:04.458 --> 01:33:05.708
[grunts]

01:33:08.041 --> 01:33:09.375
[grunting]

01:33:14.958 --> 01:33:16.791
[grunting]

01:33:33.416 --> 01:33:34.916
[in English] Bishop, the egg!

01:33:36.958 --> 01:33:38.333
[both grunting]

01:33:41.208 --> 01:33:42.375
[both grunting]

01:33:48.166 --> 01:33:49.166
[both grunting]

01:33:51.041 --> 01:33:52.375
[gun cocks]

01:33:58.416 --> 01:33:59.750
[both grunting]

01:34:02.791 --> 01:34:03.916
[screams]

01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:08.708
[yells]

01:34:20.833 --> 01:34:22.541
[dramatic music playing]

01:34:27.708 --> 01:34:29.125
[laughs]

01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:32.208
[grunting]

01:34:39.250 --> 01:34:40.458
[Booth] You saved me.

01:34:40.541 --> 01:34:43.500
You love me. You love me like crazy.

01:34:51.333 --> 01:34:52.958
- Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
- Shit!

01:34:58.208 --> 01:34:59.458
We're running out of road.

01:35:00.041 --> 01:35:02.916
Hold on to something!
If we stop, they'll catch us.

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:04.583
Then let's get caught.

01:35:04.666 --> 01:35:07.416
We can escape later.
It works for me all the time.

01:35:07.500 --> 01:35:09.666
Make sure to kick clear of the car.

01:35:09.750 --> 01:35:12.333
- I would like to workshop this idea.
- Oh, shit!

01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:18.500
[exclaiming]

01:35:26.791 --> 01:35:28.041
[muffled yelling]

01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:33.458
[tires screech]

01:35:34.666 --> 01:35:36.000
[panting]

01:35:52.333 --> 01:35:53.333
[exclaims]

01:35:54.625 --> 01:35:56.208
[gasping]

01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:09.250
[panting]

01:36:12.583 --> 01:36:14.291
It's just like we drew it up, right?

01:36:16.375 --> 01:36:17.375
Hartley?

01:36:20.041 --> 01:36:21.083
Hartley?

01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:30.500
Hartley?

01:36:36.833 --> 01:36:38.166
You will be missed.

01:36:43.791 --> 01:36:44.916
[groans softly]

01:36:47.791 --> 01:36:51.125
Oh, shit! God damn it.

01:36:51.208 --> 01:36:52.208
Hartley?

01:36:53.291 --> 01:36:56.000
Hartley? Hartley?

01:36:56.541 --> 01:36:58.708
Hey, where are you, you big idiot?

01:36:58.791 --> 01:37:00.375
[Hartley] Who are you calling an idiot?

01:37:01.541 --> 01:37:02.541
I'm right here.

01:37:10.250 --> 01:37:12.291
- Did you just choose me over the egg?
- No.

01:37:12.375 --> 01:37:14.791
- Well, it kinda looks like you did.
- I didn't.

01:37:14.875 --> 01:37:16.541
You went running in there to rescue me.

01:37:16.625 --> 01:37:18.041
I left my phone in there.

01:37:18.666 --> 01:37:21.000
You only have
a finite amount of time to save it.

01:37:21.083 --> 01:37:23.000
Stick it in a bag of rice,
it's a whole thing.

01:37:23.083 --> 01:37:24.291
You thought I was dead.

01:37:24.375 --> 01:37:26.351
I didn't think you were dead.
I wished you were dead.

01:37:26.375 --> 01:37:28.958
I saw you splashing around.
"Hartley! Hartley!"

01:37:29.041 --> 01:37:31.791
Yes, okay, I wanted to pull you out,

01:37:31.875 --> 01:37:35.250
save you, get your hopes up,
and then pull you, shove you under.

01:37:35.333 --> 01:37:37.333
[panting]

01:37:49.333 --> 01:37:52.291
Look, I'm not gonna
make a big deal out of this.

01:37:53.166 --> 01:37:55.250
I'm not gonna gloat. It's not who I am.

01:37:55.333 --> 01:37:57.791
Would some people say
that this is very embarrassing for you?

01:37:57.875 --> 01:37:59.958
Yes, of course. Of course they would.

01:38:00.041 --> 01:38:02.125
Probably everybody.

01:38:03.083 --> 01:38:04.541
But that's not important right now.

01:38:04.625 --> 01:38:08.000
What's important is that
you realize you lost and I won.

01:38:08.083 --> 01:38:09.083
We.

01:38:09.791 --> 01:38:13.125
We won. Together. Friendship. Teamwork.

01:38:13.208 --> 01:38:14.875
It's called the moral of the story.

01:38:14.958 --> 01:38:18.041
And something that I've been
wanting to say for years

01:38:18.125 --> 01:38:19.541
to your face is...

01:38:20.333 --> 01:38:21.500
Checkmate.

01:38:22.375 --> 01:38:23.625
Oh, that feels good.

01:38:23.708 --> 01:38:26.291
I've got two eggs, you've got one,
and you think you won?

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:28.708
How's that work exactly?

01:38:28.791 --> 01:38:31.333
I don't have to win
in order for you to lose.

01:38:31.416 --> 01:38:33.500
That's the best part of this whole thing.

01:38:33.583 --> 01:38:36.416
As long as I have the third egg,
you can't win.

01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:38.730
I don't care about the money anymore.

01:38:38.791 --> 01:38:40.416
Honestly, look at your face right now.

01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:42.583
That face right there.
Just... Yeah. Perfect.

01:38:42.666 --> 01:38:46.666
Resting failure face.
I mean, in a word, priceless.

01:38:46.750 --> 01:38:48.625
Also, it just gets better.

01:38:48.708 --> 01:38:51.541
As an added bonus,
my friend here, at no extra charge,

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:55.500
is gonna give you
a lifetime supply of prison.

01:38:55.583 --> 01:38:58.500
So... [in accent] That's-a nice.

01:38:59.291 --> 01:39:00.708
- Stand up.
- Stand up.

01:39:06.583 --> 01:39:07.863
Told you how this was gonna end.

01:39:19.708 --> 01:39:23.666
[ominous music playing]

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:25.750
You're right. I am the bad guy.

01:39:25.833 --> 01:39:28.625
I know how a confidence scheme works,
trust me.

01:39:28.708 --> 01:39:30.083
You don't know me, Booth.

01:39:30.708 --> 01:39:33.208
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:40.083
What the fuck?

01:39:41.083 --> 01:39:41.916
Look at him.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.708
Resting failure face. Priceless.

01:39:45.291 --> 01:39:47.208
This whole time you were working for her?

01:39:47.291 --> 01:39:48.666
Not for, with.

01:39:48.750 --> 01:39:51.833
- Like partners.
- Yeah, we're both The Bishop.

01:39:51.916 --> 01:39:53.875
Has he told you
where the third egg is yet?

01:39:54.458 --> 01:39:56.791
- [The Bishop shrieks]
- [Hartley grunts]

01:39:56.875 --> 01:39:58.791
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:39:58.875 --> 01:40:00.041
- Ready? [grunts]
- Yep.

01:40:01.708 --> 01:40:02.541
Surprise!

01:40:02.625 --> 01:40:03.958
[both chuckle]

01:40:04.666 --> 01:40:06.083
There are two bishops in chess.

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:08.416
- And a whole lotta pawns.
- Hmm.

01:40:09.666 --> 01:40:12.375
[Hartley] <i>I passed the first egg
on to her in Bali.</i>

01:40:12.458 --> 01:40:14.208
She took the second egg from Sotto Voce.

01:40:14.291 --> 01:40:17.291
And the third egg, well,
the only way for us to get our hands on it

01:40:17.375 --> 01:40:20.083
was if you led us right to it,
which you did.

01:40:20.166 --> 01:40:22.166
I thought for sure
you were gonna see through my

01:40:22.250 --> 01:40:24.125
"We're not partners,
I gotta clear my name,

01:40:24.208 --> 01:40:26.125
I'm Johnny Law, blah, blah, blah."

01:40:26.666 --> 01:40:29.208
To be honest, I thought
