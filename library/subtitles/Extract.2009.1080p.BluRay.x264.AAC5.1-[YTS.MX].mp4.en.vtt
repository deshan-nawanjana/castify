WEBVTT

00:00:36.611 --> 00:00:39.404
SALESMAN 1: Yeah,
it's expensive, but it's sweet.

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.575
Yeah. Are you familiar with
Gibson humbucking pickups at all, or...

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.247
No, I'm sorry. I actually don't play.
It's for my dad for his 50th birthday.

00:00:48.331 --> 00:00:49.748
That's... That's really sweet.

00:00:49.832 --> 00:00:51.708
Yeah, my sisters
and I are all chipping in, so...

00:00:51.793 --> 00:00:55.796
Your dad will love these humbuckings.
I mean, they really kick ass.

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.297
Excuse me,
I just have a quick question about...

00:00:57.382 --> 00:01:00.050
So, what kind of music
does your dad play?

00:01:00.134 --> 00:01:01.260
Um...

00:01:02.345 --> 00:01:05.180
I guess it's kind of jazz-ish, maybe?

00:01:05.556 --> 00:01:08.600
This is an excellent jazz guitar.
Pat Metheny plays one of these.

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.686
- Probably the best one.
- Yeah.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.813
Is your dad into Metheny at all?

00:01:12.897 --> 00:01:16.316
Oh, I'm sorry.
I actually have no idea who that is.

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:19.736
Pat Metheny is probably
the best fusion player of our times.

00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:21.947
He's like the Jake E. Lee
of fusion guitar players.

00:01:22.031 --> 00:01:24.449
- Yeah, are you into fusion?
- Yeah.

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:26.243
I don't really know what that is, either.

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:30.205
It's just... I was asking because I...
I play fusion guitar. Just curious.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.623
Yeah, I play fusion, too, actually.

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:32.791
SALESMAN 1: I teach kids.
I work with kids.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.084
- Really?
- Yeah, I work with a lot of kids.

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:35.127
One quick...

00:01:35.211 --> 00:01:36.461
SALESMAN 1: You should come
check our band out.

00:01:36.546 --> 00:01:39.047
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- Okay. Sure. That's awesome.

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:40.299
Yeah. So what do you think?

00:01:40.383 --> 00:01:43.302
Well, do you guys maybe have it
in other colors?

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:45.429
Color? You mean finishes.

00:01:45.513 --> 00:01:47.472
- SALESMAN 1: Meant finishes.
- Yeah, sorry.

00:01:47.557 --> 00:01:49.391
We have a sunburst. It's beautiful.

00:01:49.475 --> 00:01:51.476
Yeah, I just stocked one of those
in the back. I can go grab it.

00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:52.644
- No, I can pick it up.
- You want to see it?

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.271
- No, I'll get it. It comes with a case.
- I'll get it.

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:57.149
- I'm going to get the case.
- CINDY: Yeah, okay. Thank you.

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:58.483
I'm gonna get...
I'm gonna grab the case.

00:01:58.568 --> 00:01:59.860
CINDY: (CHUCKLING) Awesome.

00:02:07.243 --> 00:02:10.120
(SINGING) Well, I said, friend

00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:13.665
Don't take her, she's all I've got

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:19.921
Please don't take her love
away from me

00:02:20.923 --> 00:02:23.800
I'm beggin' you, friend

00:02:24.427 --> 00:02:27.179
Don't take her, she's all I've got

00:02:27.263 --> 00:02:29.264
Oh, shit!

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.311
She's everything in life I'll ever need

00:02:35.271 --> 00:02:37.397
She is life

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:41.860
When I want to live

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:48.658
She's everything to me in life
that life can give

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:50.869
She's my water

00:02:50.953 --> 00:02:53.121
That's not really my thing.

00:02:53.247 --> 00:02:55.207
When I need a drink

00:02:56.542 --> 00:02:59.419
She's the first thought in my mind

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:01.213
- Hey, Step.
- Hi there, Joel.

00:03:01.297 --> 00:03:03.131
- Mary.
- Hello, Joel.

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:04.966
Let me tell you now, friend

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.054
Don't take her, she's all I've got

00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:15.352
Please don't take her love
away from me

00:03:16.521 --> 00:03:18.939
I'm beggin' you, friend

00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:22.984
Don't take her, she's all I've got

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:30.117
She's everything in life
I'm ever gonna need

00:03:30.993 --> 00:03:33.453
She's my fingers

00:03:34.831 --> 00:03:37.624
When I want to feel

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:44.256
She's the only thing in life to me
that's really real

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.134
Let me tell you now, friend

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.012
Don't take her, she's all I've got

00:03:52.723 --> 00:03:57.102
Please don't take her love
away from me

00:03:58.229 --> 00:04:00.856
I'm beggin' you, friend

00:04:01.357 --> 00:04:02.649
You know, I don't know what to...

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:05.402
- They come in and...
- That's right. They're doing...

00:04:06.362 --> 00:04:11.950
She's everything in life
I'm ever gonna need

00:04:15.997 --> 00:04:17.205
DEAN: You should come by tonight.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.499
It's half-price well drinks
while the game's going.

00:04:19.584 --> 00:04:21.418
Well, you always
give me free drinks, though.

00:04:21.502 --> 00:04:23.545
I know. You should come by.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:26.339
Might as well. There's no action going
on at my house, that's for sure.

00:04:26.424 --> 00:04:28.383
Why not? Is your wife out of town?

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:31.178
No, I just haven't been laid
in about a month.

00:04:34.765 --> 00:04:37.684
Hey, did you get this job
through Job 1?

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:40.520
Me, too.

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.355
I started right there
on the assembly line,

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.982
just like you.

00:04:44.567 --> 00:04:47.444
Only I did better. Forty crates a day.

00:04:49.197 --> 00:04:52.407
That's right, vato.
I'm the best sorter in here.

00:04:53.701 --> 00:04:57.662
Yep. Probably gonna make me
floor manager at the end of this year.

00:04:57.747 --> 00:04:59.456
- That's why they made me full-time.
- You see that?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.708
That new guy? He's holding us up.

00:05:01.792 --> 00:05:04.503
It's not my job to tell him
to hold the line, either.

00:05:04.587 --> 00:05:08.882
Hey. My band's playing on Friday.
You should check us out.

00:05:09.383 --> 00:05:11.426
It's pronounced "God's cock."

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:15.305
What kind of music do you listen to?
Rock?

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:16.515
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:19.017
Yeah. Yeah. You'll like this.

00:05:19.101 --> 00:05:22.145
Ladies are free,
so bring some chicks, okay?

00:05:24.315 --> 00:05:26.107
Typical, typical.

00:05:26.484 --> 00:05:28.693
I'm just going to sit here.

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:29.903
You're not going to shut it off?

00:05:29.987 --> 00:05:31.154
I'm not going to hold the line.

00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:35.158
If they're not going to do their jobs,
I'm not going to do mine.

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:38.203
Well, if I don't get home
before about 8:00,

00:05:38.287 --> 00:05:39.538
she puts on the sweatpants,

00:05:39.622 --> 00:05:41.790
and once the sweatpants are on,
I get nothing.

00:05:41.874 --> 00:05:43.750
You know, it's over.

00:05:43.834 --> 00:05:45.001
Shit.

00:05:47.964 --> 00:05:49.297
Damn it!

00:05:51.634 --> 00:05:53.552
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

00:05:53.636 --> 00:05:55.595
What is he doing?
That's what I want to know.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.764
- Yeah? Why you ganging up on us?
- That is your job.

00:05:57.848 --> 00:06:00.559
We can't do our job
if they don't do their job!

00:06:00.643 --> 00:06:03.061
We're the only ones
that do our work around here!

00:06:03.145 --> 00:06:06.147
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:08.775
What is the problem? Let's settle down.

00:06:08.859 --> 00:06:10.026
Mary.

00:06:10.111 --> 00:06:11.861
(SHUSHING)

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.574
Hector's new here, okay?

00:06:15.658 --> 00:06:18.827
It's gonna take him a couple of days,
so you've got to be patient.

00:06:18.911 --> 00:06:20.912
Step, listen. This is something
you're gonna have to deal with

00:06:20.997 --> 00:06:22.330
if you want to be floor manager,
you got that?

00:06:22.415 --> 00:06:23.623
Exactly.

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:26.585
Great. Well, let's clean all this up, okay,
and get back to rolling.

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.503
We cannot afford to fall behind today.
Let's go.

00:06:28.588 --> 00:06:30.505
Back to your station.

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:33.592
See that? We always get the blame.

00:06:33.676 --> 00:06:35.594
Jesus, they're like a bunch of
damn children, you know?

00:06:35.678 --> 00:06:37.137
I feel like a babysitter.

00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:40.140
Sorry I missed the drama this morning.
I was showing boy genius down there

00:06:40.224 --> 00:06:42.309
how to back up a forklift.

00:06:42.643 --> 00:06:44.603
(SCOFFS) Look at him.

00:06:44.687 --> 00:06:47.397
That's his whole career, you know?
Driving that damn forklift.

00:06:47.481 --> 00:06:49.608
You'd think he'd want to learn how.

00:06:49.692 --> 00:06:51.943
Well, he does have that band
that he's involved in, as well.

00:06:52.028 --> 00:06:53.820
(SCOFFS) Yeah, right. Band.

00:06:53.904 --> 00:06:57.198
I bet you dollars to donuts
he sucks at that, too.

00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.785
- Then you got dinkus down there.
- Who? Mary?

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.163
No, no. The other one.
What's-her-face?

00:07:03.372 --> 00:07:07.375
She asked me, or rather "aksed me,"
for more personal days.

00:07:08.002 --> 00:07:09.085
Just like that.

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:12.631
I told her maybe if she figures out
how to fill out her timesheets correctly,

00:07:12.715 --> 00:07:15.216
I will give her more personal days.

00:07:15.718 --> 00:07:19.346
Don't worry. She will never fill out
her timesheets correctly.

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.722
I better get out of here.

00:07:20.806 --> 00:07:24.851
Got to beat
that 8:00 sweatpant-deadline thing.

00:07:36.614 --> 00:07:39.157
Oh, shit. Do not notice me.

00:07:39.241 --> 00:07:42.744
Do not notice me. Just go back inside.
Go back inside.

00:07:43.537 --> 00:07:45.288
God damn it! Hey.

00:07:53.589 --> 00:07:56.841
Hey, Joel. Glad I caught you.
How have you been?

00:07:56.926 --> 00:07:59.177
I'm in such a hurry right now, Nathan.

00:07:59.261 --> 00:08:00.637
Yeah? You've been busy?

00:08:00.721 --> 00:08:02.138
Yes. Very, very, very busy.

00:08:02.223 --> 00:08:04.516
And I'm so busy right now,
I gotta go make a phone call.

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.726
Gotta call the office
before they all leave for the day.

00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:10.313
Yeah. Hey, listen.
Real quick, while I've got you here,

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:13.274
what are you guys doing
November 17th?

00:08:15.444 --> 00:08:18.279
On the 17th? Um...

00:08:18.823 --> 00:08:21.616
On the 17th,
I think that we're out of town.

00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.660
Oh, yeah? Where you going?

00:08:23.744 --> 00:08:25.286
(CLICKS TONGUE)

00:08:25.496 --> 00:08:29.124
- Um...
- Wait a minute. I meant the seventh.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:32.544
You guys will definitely
be in town then, right?

00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.170
Yep.

00:08:34.255 --> 00:08:37.382
Great. Leslie and I are going
to this dinner.

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:40.885
It's an annual thing.
We go every year with the Rotary Club.

00:08:40.970 --> 00:08:44.055
It's for charity.
It's just a whole lot of fun.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.558
And we would like to invite you
and Suzie

00:08:46.642 --> 00:08:48.059
to be our guests at our table...

00:08:48.144 --> 00:08:51.646
Nathan, I just... I don't think that that's
something that we're gonna want to do.

00:08:51.731 --> 00:08:52.897
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:08:52.982 --> 00:08:54.524
Why not? It's a lot of fun.

00:08:54.608 --> 00:08:56.317
I don't know.

00:08:57.278 --> 00:09:00.613
Suzie doesn't like going
to those kinds of things.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:02.490
Why not?

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:06.745
We wouldn't know anybody,
and she gets really uncomfortable.

00:09:06.829 --> 00:09:08.413
- Oh, it's not like that.
- Sure it is.

00:09:08.497 --> 00:09:12.917
No, she won't feel uncomfortable.
It's not formal or anything.

00:09:13.002 --> 00:09:15.879
It's just a real loose bunch.

00:09:16.297 --> 00:09:17.297
You know, I...

00:09:17.381 --> 00:09:20.008
Tell you what. Why don't we do this?

00:09:20.634 --> 00:09:22.010
I'm gonna go ahead
and buy those tickets,

00:09:22.094 --> 00:09:23.970
since they're gonna sell out fast.

00:09:24.054 --> 00:09:26.973
You talk to Suzie. See what she says.

00:09:27.057 --> 00:09:29.434
Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a call.

00:09:29.518 --> 00:09:32.145
You know how it is
when the wives start talking.

00:09:32.229 --> 00:09:34.189
(CHUCKLING)

00:09:34.273 --> 00:09:36.065
- I can almost hear it...
- We're gonna talk about this later.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:38.109
Got to make the call.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.000
Sorry, Joel, I almost forgot.

00:09:54.084 --> 00:09:56.252
The tickets are $40 a plate.

00:09:56.337 --> 00:10:00.465
Now, I know that's a little bit steep,
but the food is fantastic.

00:10:00.549 --> 00:10:02.634
So, that's $80 total.
There's no tax or anything.

00:10:02.718 --> 00:10:04.636
Nathan, I really gotta get inside
and make this phone call.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.971
You and I are gonna talk about this
some other time, okay?

00:10:07.056 --> 00:10:09.557
You go do that. Hey, Joel?

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.434
If you want us to look out
after the house

00:10:11.519 --> 00:10:13.686
while you're gone or anything,
we can do that.

00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:16.189
- I appreciate that.
- Okay. Yup.

00:10:16.857 --> 00:10:19.442
Hey, where you guys going, anyway?

00:10:21.904 --> 00:10:22.987
We're going on vacation.

00:10:23.072 --> 00:10:27.742
Gosh, I tell you, Leslie and I would love
to go on a vacation with you guys.

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:32.956
I gotta go.

00:10:33.582 --> 00:10:35.166
All right, then.

00:10:35.251 --> 00:10:36.835
I appreciate it, Nathan.
Thank you so much.

00:10:36.919 --> 00:10:38.628
You do your thing.

00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:42.465
Joel? One more thing.

00:10:43.467 --> 00:10:44.843
Hey, Joel?

00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:53.434
- Hon.
- Hi.

00:10:53.769 --> 00:10:56.145
Man, that Nathan won't shut up.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:59.691
Oh, I know. What an asshole.
That wife of his is even worse.

00:10:59.775 --> 00:11:02.735
I mean, I wonder how long he would
talk if you just let him go, you know?

00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:06.072
I'm actually afraid
to go into our own front yard sometimes

00:11:06.156 --> 00:11:08.783
because I'm afraid
he's going to be milling around.

00:11:08.868 --> 00:11:10.368
Remember when we had our condo?

00:11:10.452 --> 00:11:12.871
We could just go
straight from the garage inside.

00:11:12.955 --> 00:11:14.581
No one would bother us.

00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:15.832
We could walk to 7-Eleven.

00:11:15.916 --> 00:11:16.916
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)

00:11:17.001 --> 00:11:19.711
We didn't have to worry
about plumbers or pool cleaners.

00:11:19.795 --> 00:11:21.754
Speaking of that,
we've got to hire a new pool cleaner.

00:11:21.839 --> 00:11:24.591
He never checks the chlorine levels.

00:11:27.011 --> 00:11:29.679
Sorry, it's just this new synthetic vanilla

00:11:29.763 --> 00:11:31.472
has a much higher triple point
than we thought,

00:11:31.557 --> 00:11:33.349
which means that
the new cookies-and-cream extract

00:11:33.434 --> 00:11:35.393
that we've been working on
could really work,

00:11:35.477 --> 00:11:39.439
and I just... I gotta get to this
before Weber Flavors beats us to it,

00:11:39.523 --> 00:11:42.901
'cause if something like this caught on,
it could be big.

00:11:43.527 --> 00:11:45.653
Could sell the company.

00:11:47.656 --> 00:11:50.533
Do you remember
that logo that you designed

00:11:50.618 --> 00:11:52.785
for the original
cookies-and-cream extract?

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:56.205
I still have that framed in my office.
Do you remember it?

00:11:56.290 --> 00:12:00.168
Yeah. And now I design coupons.

00:12:04.256 --> 00:12:06.674
Do you want to go to the bedroom?

00:12:08.344 --> 00:12:11.304
- Oh, I'm a little tired.
- Really?

00:12:11.388 --> 00:12:14.766
Yeah, just... I don't know.
It's the middle of the week.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:16.935
It's not the middle of the week.
It's Monday, baby.

00:12:17.019 --> 00:12:18.019
It's Monday? Shit!

00:12:18.103 --> 00:12:20.229
- What happened?
- Dancing with the Stars.

I gotta get a house
that's got a bathroom

00:12:30.324 --> 00:12:32.825
that doesn't share a wall with the TV.

00:12:32.910 --> 00:12:34.827
Why would you do that?

00:12:34.912 --> 00:12:37.246
Because it is a little tough to jerk it

00:12:37.331 --> 00:12:39.791
with the TV blaring at you
through the wall, Dean.

00:12:39.875 --> 00:12:41.668
Well, why don't you use
one of the other two bathrooms?

00:12:41.752 --> 00:12:43.711
It'd be too suspicious.
We don't use those bathrooms.

00:12:43.796 --> 00:12:46.214
I'll just...
I'll put some insulation in or something.

00:12:46.298 --> 00:12:47.715
Insulation?

00:12:48.050 --> 00:12:51.302
You do not need
to put fiberglass in your walls

00:12:51.387 --> 00:12:53.972
because you have so much
masturbation shame.

00:12:54.056 --> 00:12:57.266
You need to take responsibility
for yourself and snap one off

wherever you want to
in your own home.

00:12:59.770 --> 00:13:03.147
You own your house.
You own your own business.

I mean,
you used to be a bartender here.

00:13:05.317 --> 00:13:06.651
Now look at what you have.

00:13:06.735 --> 00:13:09.237
I know, but come on. What...
What, really, do I have?

00:13:09.321 --> 00:13:10.738
Okay? It's a pain in the ass.

00:13:10.823 --> 00:13:12.949
I work all the time.
What does it get me?

00:13:13.033 --> 00:13:15.034
Nobody cares about extracts,
certainly not my wife.

The stock guy with the shitty band
probably gets laid more often than I do.

00:13:18.622 --> 00:13:21.666
Yeah, but he probably lives
in a really crappy apartment.

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.085
I would very gladly move
into a crappy apartment

00:13:24.169 --> 00:13:27.088

wasn't right next to the TV.

CINDY: It belonged to my father.

00:13:29.633 --> 00:13:32.969
He passed away last month
and we have all these stupid bills,

00:13:33.053 --> 00:13:35.054
and it's just been really hard for me,
you know?

00:13:35.139 --> 00:13:37.515
He was really into fusion.

00:13:38.142 --> 00:13:40.351
You know, I'm not supposed to say this,

00:13:40.436 --> 00:13:43.146
but given the circumstances,

00:13:43.564 --> 00:13:45.857
you know, you could take this
down to the music store

00:13:45.941 --> 00:13:47.191
and get a lot better deal.

00:13:47.276 --> 00:13:50.194
No, that's okay. Really.
I just wanna get this over with.

00:13:50.279 --> 00:13:52.864
- I just want it gone.
- I understand. I understand. Here.

00:13:52.948 --> 00:13:56.909
I just... I want you to have a little extra.
Here. Come on.

00:13:57.453 --> 00:14:00.997
- No. No, no, no. I couldn't. No. No.
- No, no. Just... Just take the money.

00:14:01.081 --> 00:14:04.000
You've been through enough already.
Come on.

00:14:04.585 --> 00:14:06.210
Okay. Okay.

00:14:06.295 --> 00:14:08.046
Oh, my gosh.

God bless you. Thank you so much.
Thank you.

Hey.

Are we still looking into
replacing her with a robot?

00:14:21.477 --> 00:14:24.020
Yeah, sure. But we might not have to.

00:14:24.104 --> 00:14:25.480
You're not gonna believe this,
but remember that guy,

00:14:25.564 --> 00:14:27.231
Michael J. Natherton
from General Mills,

00:14:27.316 --> 00:14:29.525
who called a while back, talking like
he might want to buy us out?

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:31.569
Yeah. I thought you said
that he wasn't serious,

00:14:31.653 --> 00:14:32.779
he was just kicking the tires.

00:14:32.863 --> 00:14:35.323
Yeah, well, he's serious now.
He just made us an offer.

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:37.158
- I mean, a real offer.
- Are you kidding me?

00:14:37.242 --> 00:14:39.118
It must be part of some
bigger strategic move,

00:14:39.203 --> 00:14:42.121
because this is over market value,
I think.

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.418
Wow.

00:14:49.046 --> 00:14:52.090
I might be able to finally unload
all this stuff and retire, huh?

00:14:52.174 --> 00:14:53.466
I mean,
there's a lot of details to work out,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:56.511
but, yeah, this... This could be great.

00:14:56.595 --> 00:15:00.348
He says he'll call back next week.
What should I tell him?

00:15:02.017 --> 00:15:03.893
You tell him, "Hell, yes."

00:15:03.977 --> 00:15:05.603
Adiós, dinkus.

00:15:08.190 --> 00:15:09.273
You see that?

00:15:09.358 --> 00:15:11.609
I already warned him.
This is the last time.

00:15:11.693 --> 00:15:13.820
I'm just gonna sit here.

00:15:23.205 --> 00:15:24.997
Oh, no. What now?

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:36.843
(EXCLAIMING)

00:15:37.678 --> 00:15:38.719
Oh!

00:16:10.252 --> 00:16:14.088
I knew it. That's what happens
when you don't pay attention.

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:16.299
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:16:20.345 --> 00:16:23.931
Yeah, all right.
Just call me if you hear anything else.

00:16:26.435 --> 00:16:27.685
He definitely lost one of them,
and they think

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:30.021
that they can reattach the other one,
but they're not sure.

00:16:30.105 --> 00:16:32.231
Wow. That's hardcore.

00:16:32.316 --> 00:16:33.858
I have no idea how this happened.

00:16:33.942 --> 00:16:36.027
We've got such a good safety record,

00:16:36.111 --> 00:16:38.196
and we comply
with all the safety codes.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.532
I think it was just some kind
of a freak accident, you know?

00:16:41.617 --> 00:16:43.326
Well, you probably have insurance
for that, right?

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:45.870
Yeah, of course. He's probably
gonna get a huge settlement.

00:16:45.954 --> 00:16:47.705
Yeah, I would think so.

00:16:47.789 --> 00:16:50.666
I mean, it's your balls.

00:16:51.627 --> 00:16:55.588
It kind of makes you think, doesn't it,
how fragile we all are?

00:16:56.048 --> 00:16:59.383
Especially our balls.
They're just hanging there.

00:16:59.843 --> 00:17:01.344
A little sack.

00:17:01.637 --> 00:17:04.555
Any minute,
could just be cut off forever.

00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:07.350
What'd life be like,
walking around without testicles?

00:17:07.434 --> 00:17:08.726
Can you imagine that shit?

00:17:08.810 --> 00:17:11.229
Yeah, actually,
I rarely use my balls anymore at all.

00:17:11.313 --> 00:17:12.271
What about the other night?

00:17:12.356 --> 00:17:14.315
I thought you were gonna rub one out
to Dancing with the Stars.

00:17:14.399 --> 00:17:16.359
I mean that, you know,

00:17:16.443 --> 00:17:19.695
Suzie and I have sex
maybe once every three months.

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:23.324
You know,
sexual frustration is really hard.

00:17:24.076 --> 00:17:26.118
But I may have a solution.

00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:29.330
- What?
- You need to take some Xanax.

00:17:31.333 --> 00:17:33.251
Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety?

00:17:33.335 --> 00:17:37.088
It's good for all psychological problems
in the DSM-IV.

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:41.384
Xanax basically
just makes you feel good.

00:17:41.927 --> 00:17:44.470
That's why it works for everything.

00:17:45.097 --> 00:17:47.682
I take it for the common head cold.

00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:51.852
I think it would work great
for sexual frustration.

00:17:52.104 --> 00:17:54.021
- Want me to get you some?
- No, I don't.

00:17:54.106 --> 00:17:58.109
You know what else is good?
Codeine cough syrup.

00:17:58.819 --> 00:18:00.945
- For what?
- It's just good.

00:18:35.814 --> 00:18:37.064
FEMALE OPERATOR: What listing?

00:18:37.149 --> 00:18:41.068
Don Wilkinson or Step Wilkinson.

00:18:41.153 --> 00:18:43.696
- One moment.
- Can I have the address, please?

00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:45.531
I'm sorry.
I'm not showing anything for either.

00:18:45.615 --> 00:18:48.200
There's a D. Wilkinson,
but it's unlisted.

00:18:49.619 --> 00:18:51.245
Okay. Thank you.

00:18:56.043 --> 00:18:57.168
So, the guys at General Mills

00:18:57.252 --> 00:18:59.962
got wind of this whole
testicular incident

00:19:00.047 --> 00:19:01.797
and they're worried.

00:19:01.882 --> 00:19:04.175
If Step decides to sue us
beyond the insurance settlement,

00:19:04.259 --> 00:19:06.761
that could be a serious liability.

00:19:06.845 --> 00:19:08.512
How is Step doing, anyway?

00:19:08.597 --> 00:19:11.349
Better.
I guess he might be going home today.

00:19:11.433 --> 00:19:12.433
Oh, good.

00:19:12.517 --> 00:19:13.851
Anyway, I guess
we don't have to worry about it.

00:19:13.935 --> 00:19:16.187
He says he's not going to sue us.

00:19:16.271 --> 00:19:18.147
(IMITATING STEP) Says he
wouldn't want something for nothing,

00:19:18.231 --> 00:19:20.691
you know, and what's right is right.

00:19:20.776 --> 00:19:22.943
He's being pretty mellow about this.

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:24.278
Yeah.

00:19:24.946 --> 00:19:27.782
I think when you lose your balls,
it kind of mellows you out.

00:19:30.118 --> 00:19:32.203
Oh, by the way,
guess who asked for a raise today?

00:19:32.287 --> 00:19:34.789
- Who?
- Dinkus. Can you believe that?

00:19:34.873 --> 00:19:36.707
Brian, you know,
you call everyone here dinkus.

00:19:36.792 --> 00:19:38.626
I don't know who you're talking about.

00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:40.795
- You know, forklift dinkus.
- Oh.

00:19:41.588 --> 00:19:44.215
I thought you call him "boy genius."

00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:47.134
Oh, right. Yeah.
Well, boy genius asked for a raise.

00:19:47.219 --> 00:19:48.552
I said, "Are you kidding me?

00:19:48.637 --> 00:19:50.054
"You almost got somebody
killed last week."

00:19:50.138 --> 00:19:52.515
And then he tried to blame it
on dinkus over there.

00:19:52.599 --> 00:19:54.725
You know, you really ought to learn
the employees' names.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:56.435
Yeah, I was thinking about that,
but then I figured,

00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.063
hey, if this deal goes through
next week, I won't have to.

00:19:59.147 --> 00:20:03.734
It's not like I'm gonna be inviting dinkus
and boy genius over for dinner.

00:20:03.944 --> 00:20:07.238
Oh, Joel, let me introduce you
to the new temps here.

00:20:07.322 --> 00:20:09.657
One of them wanted to meet you.

00:20:10.742 --> 00:20:12.660
Joel, this is Cindy.

00:20:14.329 --> 00:20:15.746
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:20:17.082 --> 00:20:18.499
(MOUTHING) Oh, my God.

00:20:18.583 --> 00:20:20.334
And...

00:20:22.504 --> 00:20:23.921
I'm sorry. I forgot your name.

00:20:24.005 --> 00:20:25.131
- Victor.
- Victor! Right.

00:20:25.215 --> 00:20:27.383
Hi. Joel. Welcome.

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:30.177
- Okay.
- BRIAN: Mmm-hmm.

00:20:42.023 --> 00:20:43.732
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:20:44.484 --> 00:20:50.614
Look, I'm so sorry, but are you really
the owner of this entire place?

00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:52.575
Yeah.

00:20:52.659 --> 00:20:55.703
I mean, like, you...
You started it and everything?

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:58.372
Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.542
Oh, my God. How?

00:21:03.378 --> 00:21:07.089
Just... You really wanna hear this?
A lot of people think it's boring.

00:21:07.174 --> 00:21:09.925
No, no. I... Really, I do. I wanna know.

00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:13.304
I mean, did you, like,
invent extract or something?

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.640
- Kind of.
- Really?

00:21:16.725 --> 00:21:18.809
Well, my mother used to...

00:21:18.894 --> 00:21:21.937
My mother used to make
these root-beer cookies,

00:21:22.022 --> 00:21:24.440
and I always noticed
that the cookie dough

00:21:24.524 --> 00:21:26.150
tasted better
than the cookies themselves,

00:21:26.234 --> 00:21:27.401
and I thought, "Why is that?"

00:21:27.486 --> 00:21:29.195
And it turns out that a lot of the flavor

00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:31.864
in the root-beer extract evaporates
when you cook it,

00:21:31.948 --> 00:21:35.284
and so when I was in graduate school,
in chemistry,

00:21:35.368 --> 00:21:38.204
I figured out a way
to use this synthetic derivative

00:21:38.288 --> 00:21:41.165
of the wintergreen component,
and it just...

00:21:41.249 --> 00:21:45.753
It doesn't evaporate as easily.
And from that, you know...

00:21:46.755 --> 00:21:47.922
Wow.

00:21:48.673 --> 00:21:52.843
I mean, you... You figured
all of that out, like, with your brain!

00:21:52.928 --> 00:21:55.763
- Yeah.
- Oh, you must be really rich.

00:21:56.223 --> 00:21:59.517
I've got a 7 Series BMW
and some pretty nice clothes.

00:21:59.601 --> 00:22:01.602
You know so many people.

00:22:01.686 --> 00:22:04.855
- I...
- Oh, my God. You are really popular.

00:22:06.316 --> 00:22:07.775
(LAUGHING)

00:22:08.735 --> 00:22:09.735
What?

00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:13.322
It's just really cute
how your sixes look like eights.

00:22:13.782 --> 00:22:15.824
Or is it more like your eights
look like sixes?

00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:17.284
Which one is it?

00:22:17.369 --> 00:22:18.869
Hey, dude.
You wanna hit some golf balls, man?

00:22:18.954 --> 00:22:21.080
Hey, Dean. Cindy, here.

00:22:21.164 --> 00:22:22.623
Oh, damn.

00:22:23.124 --> 00:22:25.834
Goodness. Hi. Dean.

00:22:25.919 --> 00:22:28.254
Entrepreneur, spiritualist, healer.

00:22:28.338 --> 00:22:29.380
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

00:22:29.464 --> 00:22:31.173
Nice to meet you.
Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.

00:22:31.258 --> 00:22:32.550
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Welcome aboard.

00:22:32.634 --> 00:22:35.344
We're gonna play some golf,
but maybe we could all just hang out?

00:22:35.428 --> 00:22:37.096
- Dean?
- Dude.

00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:39.723
Does she work here?

00:22:39.808 --> 00:22:41.058
Yeah, she's a temp.

00:22:41.142 --> 00:22:44.019
- She's a tramp?
- Temp!

00:22:44.104 --> 00:22:47.523
And please don't stare at her.
Get away from the window.

00:22:48.858 --> 00:22:50.484
I like it, Joel. I like your style.

00:22:50.569 --> 00:22:53.279
Well, I didn't hire her.
She came over through Job 1.

00:22:53.363 --> 00:22:55.197
They just sent her over
like everyone else.

00:22:55.282 --> 00:22:59.910
Job 1, huh?
I got to give those guys a call, man.

00:23:01.121 --> 00:23:05.082
I have never seen a woman
anywhere near that hot working here.

00:23:05.166 --> 00:23:09.253
Makes sense, though, huh?
I mean, hot girls need jobs, too, right?

00:23:10.005 --> 00:23:11.589
Do they really?

00:23:12.132 --> 00:23:16.260
I mean, most of your temps
look like winos, man, and they're guys.

00:23:16.344 --> 00:23:19.263
- You wanna hear something weird, too?
- Yeah.

00:23:19.347 --> 00:23:21.765
I think that she was flirting with me.

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.267
Really?

00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:25.603
- Could be wrong.
- No, I'm sure, man.

00:23:25.687 --> 00:23:28.439
Dude, you could probably have any girl
out there, that's walking around,

00:23:28.523 --> 00:23:30.774
anyone that you see right now
with the hairnet on, man,

00:23:30.859 --> 00:23:31.859
you could probably nail.

00:23:31.943 --> 00:23:34.278
- I don't know about that.
- I'm telling you, man,

00:23:34.362 --> 00:23:35.696
you're the king of this whole domain.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:37.656
This is your place.
You're the ruler here.

00:23:37.741 --> 00:23:39.742
You're the king of the...

00:23:39.826 --> 00:23:41.076
What is this shit
you're making out here?

00:23:41.161 --> 00:23:43.287
It's extract,
and it's spray-dried flavoring, and...

00:23:43.371 --> 00:23:45.414
You're the extract king, man.

00:23:45.498 --> 00:23:47.750
And these females out here sense that,

00:23:47.834 --> 00:23:49.877
and you can have them if you want that,
you know?

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:53.547
I personally wouldn't, because
they're not sexually attractive to me,

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:56.508
but, you know, that girl right there,

00:23:57.093 --> 00:23:59.386
- good for you, Joel.
- MARY: Somebody stole my purse!

00:23:59.471 --> 00:24:00.804
What the shit?

00:24:00.889 --> 00:24:05.934
My purse is stolen! It's gone! He did it!
He stole my purse! You!

00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:07.811
You stole my purse! He did it!

00:24:07.896 --> 00:24:09.480
- He did it! He stole my purse!
- Hey, wait, wait!

00:24:09.564 --> 00:24:10.564
- I told you about him!
- Calm down!

00:24:10.649 --> 00:24:11.649
Calm down one minute, will you?

00:24:11.733 --> 00:24:13.942
I'm not gonna calm down!
I'm gonna call the cops!

00:24:14.027 --> 00:24:17.488
Will you please time out?
I speak the language, okay? Hector.

00:24:19.532 --> 00:24:21.909
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

00:24:23.411 --> 00:24:25.579
- You know, purse-o?
- Purse! That's right!

00:24:25.664 --> 00:24:26.830
You stole my purse
and took my money!

00:24:26.915 --> 00:24:28.707
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute, okay?
- He stole my purse.

00:24:28.792 --> 00:24:31.335
Give me a break, please?
How do you know it's stolen?

00:24:31.419 --> 00:24:33.796
I know it's stolen because it's gone,
that's how!

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.838
What does it look like?

00:24:34.923 --> 00:24:37.341
It's a white leather
multi-colored patchwork purse

00:24:37.425 --> 00:24:40.552
with a turquoise lining
and a cute little teddy bear in a tutu!

00:24:58.655 --> 00:25:01.532
(SINGING) You didn't have to love me
like you did

00:25:01.616 --> 00:25:04.076
But you did, but you did

00:25:04.703 --> 00:25:06.954
And I thank you

00:25:07.372 --> 00:25:10.249
You didn't have to love me like you did

00:25:10.333 --> 00:25:12.626
But you did, but you did

00:25:13.461 --> 00:25:15.629
And I thank you

00:25:16.381 --> 00:25:19.967
But you took your love to someone else

00:25:20.468 --> 00:25:24.346
I wouldn't know what it meant
to be loved to death

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.976
You made me feel like I've never felt

00:25:29.519 --> 00:25:33.439
Kisses so good I had to holler for help

00:25:33.565 --> 00:25:36.567
You didn't have to hold it, but you did

00:25:36.651 --> 00:25:39.069
But you did, but you did

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:41.530
And I thank you

00:25:51.499 --> 00:25:54.585
You can go ahead of me
if that's all you got.

00:25:55.211 --> 00:25:56.920
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

00:25:57.005 --> 00:25:58.505
Are you sure?

00:25:59.299 --> 00:26:02.259
That's really, really sweet of you.
Thank you.

00:26:02.343 --> 00:26:04.928
I can't believe
I'm buying Reynold's Extract.

00:26:05.013 --> 00:26:08.015
I mean, I work at the factory, you know?

00:26:08.099 --> 00:26:10.225
Really? I work there, too.

00:26:10.852 --> 00:26:11.935
Are you serious?

00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.481
Yeah, I sure do.
Well, I used to, but... Yeah.

00:26:15.857 --> 00:26:17.691
Well, I just started working there.

00:26:17.776 --> 00:26:20.652
Yeah, I'm the fastest sorter there.

00:26:21.196 --> 00:26:24.031
- Really?
- Yeah. Forty crates a day.

00:26:24.574 --> 00:26:26.950
They were gonna make me
floor manager.

00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:28.160
Well, I'm Cindy.

00:26:30.997 --> 00:26:32.498
(DOOR CLOSES)

00:26:46.387 --> 00:26:49.807
We don't do it anymore, you know?
It's... We just... I don't know what to do.

00:26:49.891 --> 00:26:53.477
We're turning into one of those
brother-sister couples.

00:26:53.895 --> 00:26:55.562
You do kind of look alike.

00:26:55.647 --> 00:26:57.314
- No, we don't.
- Okay.

00:26:57.816 --> 00:26:59.024
And to make things worse,

00:26:59.108 --> 00:27:03.153
Dean, I cannot get
that Cindy girl out of my mind.

00:27:03.822 --> 00:27:06.740
And how often am I going
to meet a girl that pretty

00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:09.827
and that into food flavoring? It's just...

00:27:09.911 --> 00:27:11.495
You know she practically
asked me out?

00:27:11.579 --> 00:27:13.497
She gave me her phone number
and everything.

00:27:13.581 --> 00:27:16.250
Asked me if I was going to that party
where Rory's band is playing.

00:27:16.334 --> 00:27:17.501
- Can you believe that?
- Really?

00:27:17.585 --> 00:27:19.419
- Yeah.
- What are you going to do?

00:27:19.504 --> 00:27:20.504
What do you mean,
what am I gonna do?

00:27:20.588 --> 00:27:22.172
I'm gonna do nothing.
I can't cheat on Suzie.

00:27:22.257 --> 00:27:25.342
I just got to power through it
until I'm too old to get it up, you know?

00:27:25.426 --> 00:27:26.593
Then I'll be all right.

00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:28.512
What if Suzie cheated on you?

00:27:28.596 --> 00:27:30.931
(SCOFFS) Right. Come on.

00:27:31.015 --> 00:27:34.226
Listen, man. I like Suzie.
You know what I'm saying?

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.853
And I got nothing against her,

00:27:35.937 --> 00:27:39.606
but what if she's feeling
the same way you were? Right?

00:27:39.774 --> 00:27:42.985
What if she cheated on you?
Would that bother you?

00:27:45.113 --> 00:27:48.949
I don't... No, I guess...
No, I guess it wouldn't, at this point.

00:27:49.033 --> 00:27:50.742
I guess that's a little weird, isn't it?

00:27:50.827 --> 00:27:53.954
Yeah, a bit, but, you know,
do you think she would do it?

00:27:54.038 --> 00:27:55.539
- What? Cheat on me? No.
- You sure?

00:27:55.623 --> 00:27:58.125
Well, I don't know, actually.
Hang on. She might.

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:00.460
Suzie might.
She could be tempted, I suppose.

00:28:00.545 --> 00:28:02.796
If some really studly guy hit on her...

00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:07.342
So, you're saying
that she would cheat on you

00:28:07.427 --> 00:28:09.052
if she were placed in temptation's way,

00:28:09.137 --> 00:28:11.930
and yet you're in temptation's way
and you're not cheating on her?

00:28:12.015 --> 00:28:13.765
- That's right.
- Okay, bro.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.225
Here's what you need to do.

00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:18.186
- I don't want drugs, Dean.
- There are ways,

00:28:18.938 --> 00:28:22.524
ancient ways from Aztec times

00:28:22.942 --> 00:28:27.654
of getting your wife to cheat on you,
if that is what you need.

00:28:27.739 --> 00:28:28.864
Let's hear it.

00:28:28.948 --> 00:28:31.950
You hire a gigolo

00:28:33.077 --> 00:28:35.746
to have an affair with your wife.

00:28:37.081 --> 00:28:40.334
- What?
- I'm serious, bro. I know a guy.

00:28:40.418 --> 00:28:42.252
- You know a gigolo?
- Yes, I do.

00:28:42.337 --> 00:28:43.503
How do you know a gigolo?

00:28:43.588 --> 00:28:45.380
- This guy, Brad.
- Brad the gigolo?

00:28:45.465 --> 00:28:49.217
Yes, who comes in here all the time.
He's friends of Cliff.

00:28:49.302 --> 00:28:52.304
You hire Brad.
He has an affair with Suzie.

00:28:52.722 --> 00:28:55.223
All right. Yeah. Don't you have
another customer to help or something?

00:28:55.308 --> 00:28:57.309
Dude, you just told me
that you wouldn't mind

00:28:57.393 --> 00:28:58.936
if she fooled around
with somebody else.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.062
And if she fools around
with somebody else,

00:29:00.146 --> 00:29:03.106
you have no guilty feelings
about hooking up with Cindy.

00:29:03.191 --> 00:29:08.445
All your problems are solved.
Stroke-of-genius idea on my part.

00:29:08.529 --> 00:29:10.948
Jesus Christ,
maybe I will try some of your Xanax.

00:29:11.032 --> 00:29:12.824
- Come on.
- Seriously.

00:29:13.618 --> 00:29:15.535
I think what I'm gonna do is,
I'm gonna sit Suzie down

00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:16.662
and I'm just gonna talk to her about it.

00:29:16.746 --> 00:29:19.331
- Bing!
- No, that was a joke.

00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:21.124
Not a joke.

00:29:21.209 --> 00:29:23.001
- Joking.
- Serious.

00:29:25.213 --> 00:29:27.172
This gonna shut you up?

00:29:30.343 --> 00:29:31.885
Tell me what this stuff does, again.

00:29:34.055 --> 00:29:36.932
STEP: Yeah, I just believe
what's right is right.

00:29:37.016 --> 00:29:38.350
CINDY: That's right, Step.

00:29:38.434 --> 00:29:41.478
And what's right is
for you to send a message

00:29:41.562 --> 00:29:46.108
so that a horrible accident like this
never happens to anybody ever again.

00:29:46.192 --> 00:29:48.652
That's why I got a lawyer for you.

00:29:49.237 --> 00:29:51.071
You want to know who?

00:29:51.406 --> 00:29:54.324
- Who?
- The guy on all the bus-stop benches.

00:29:54.409 --> 00:29:56.952
- Joe Adler? You got me Joe Adler?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:29:57.036 --> 00:29:58.245
Yeah.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:01.081
You're so good to me, Cindy.

00:30:06.087 --> 00:30:08.505
Okay. Oh, my gosh. Step, I'm sorry.

00:30:08.589 --> 00:30:10.507
You're getting me aroused,

00:30:10.591 --> 00:30:12.259
and I'm getting you aroused,

00:30:12.343 --> 00:30:14.845
and your doctor said
that you should not get aroused

00:30:14.929 --> 00:30:16.763
till after the trial.

00:30:17.223 --> 00:30:19.016
Step, I'm so sorry.

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:22.811
I'm sorry. I think we should go.
I'm sorry.

00:30:26.691 --> 00:30:29.860
STEP: Man. Look at all them mallards.

00:30:29.944 --> 00:30:32.779
I knew I should have brought
the Mossberg.

00:30:33.823 --> 00:30:35.157
DEAN: Shit.

00:30:35.241 --> 00:30:37.993
Do you remember what color
that pill was I gave you?

00:30:38.077 --> 00:30:40.287
- What?
- Damn it.

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:42.539
I don't think it was Xanax.

00:30:42.623 --> 00:30:46.084
Could have been Ritalin or Special K.

00:30:48.337 --> 00:30:49.963
I don't care. What?

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:53.675
Well, Special K is a horse tranquilizer.

00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.219
It sometimes has weird effects
on humans.

00:30:56.304 --> 00:30:57.721
Hey, it's nothing to worry about.

00:30:57.805 --> 00:31:00.474
Probably just shouldn't drink anymore.

00:31:01.059 --> 00:31:02.517
Remember that thing
you were talking about?

00:31:02.602 --> 00:31:04.728
- About the gigolo?
- Yeah?

00:31:04.812 --> 00:31:06.855
You don't think that is wrong?

00:31:06.939 --> 00:31:08.607
You don't think that
that is morally wrong?

00:31:08.691 --> 00:31:10.150
What could be morally wrong
about that?

00:31:10.234 --> 00:31:11.818
Yeah, I don't know.

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:15.363
Look, man.
If she doesn't wanna do anything,

00:31:15.448 --> 00:31:17.365
she doesn't have to, okay?

00:31:17.450 --> 00:31:20.744
But if she does,
then she's the one who sinned,

00:31:20.828 --> 00:31:22.120
and you're the one
who can go out there

00:31:22.205 --> 00:31:24.581
and drop the Joel-pole
in whoever the hell you want to.

00:31:24.665 --> 00:31:26.208
And that's what's morally appropriate.

00:31:26.292 --> 00:31:30.253
I cannot... I can't see anything
morally wrong with it, either,

00:31:30.338 --> 00:31:32.547
and... And he's a friend of yours, right?
What is his name?

00:31:32.632 --> 00:31:33.840
Brad. You want me
to get on the phone with him?

00:31:33.925 --> 00:31:35.258
No, no. Just hang on.

00:31:35.343 --> 00:31:38.178
It's very weird
to even talk about this, Dean.

00:31:38.262 --> 00:31:43.517
Dude, all you got to do is tell her
he's coming to be the new pool guy

00:31:43.601 --> 00:31:46.978
or whatever, and see what happens.
Seriously.

00:31:47.063 --> 00:31:50.607
If she doesn't go for it, terrific.

00:31:50.691 --> 00:31:53.902
Now you just feel better for not
fooling around in the first place.

00:31:54.028 --> 00:31:57.447
I think you're right,
and we do need a new pool cleaner.

00:31:57.532 --> 00:31:58.949
That's a sign, bro.

00:31:59.033 --> 00:32:02.035
Yeah, I just... I don't know. It's so nuts.

00:32:03.371 --> 00:32:05.413
You got to listen to the universe.

00:32:05.498 --> 00:32:07.833
Why don't you have
another drink, man?

00:32:07.917 --> 00:32:10.085
You know what?
Why don't I go call Brad?

00:32:10.169 --> 00:32:12.295
See what he has to say about this?

00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:13.922
What the hell.

00:32:15.925 --> 00:32:20.512
It seems pretty clear, right?
I mean, it's $200, right?

00:32:20.596 --> 00:32:22.180
Yeah. It's 200.

00:32:22.849 --> 00:32:26.143
Well, yeah. I mean, you know,
I'm getting my 10%.

00:32:26.227 --> 00:32:28.270
Come on, Dean. What are you?
You're a pimp now?

00:32:28.354 --> 00:32:31.398
I don't think they call it a pimp
when it's with a male prostitute, Joel.

00:32:31.482 --> 00:32:33.900
- All right.
- DEAN: They have another name for it.

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:36.862
It's not a john,
but it's something like that.

00:32:36.946 --> 00:32:38.572
They call it something else.

00:32:38.656 --> 00:32:39.906
Look, I'm the one
who hooked this whole thing up.

00:32:39.991 --> 00:32:40.991
- I get it.
- DEAN: Okay?

00:32:41.075 --> 00:32:42.492
You have nothing to worry about
'cause it all comes out

00:32:42.577 --> 00:32:43.869
- of his money, anyway.
- All right!

00:32:43.953 --> 00:32:45.871
- Fine.
- So, it's $200.

00:32:45.955 --> 00:32:47.414
Yep. 220.

00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:49.207
- Dean!
- What?

00:32:49.292 --> 00:32:51.042
I have a question.

00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:52.586
Yep.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:57.340
So, are you, like,
gonna watch or something?

00:32:59.177 --> 00:33:02.679
No, no. No, no. No, I'm...
I'm not even gonna be there.

00:33:02.763 --> 00:33:05.348
I'm gonna be at work.
Don't you remember? We covered this.

00:33:05.433 --> 00:33:08.602
- Didn't we cover this?
- Look, dude, here's the story.

00:33:08.686 --> 00:33:10.562
What you're gonna do is,

00:33:10.646 --> 00:33:13.398
you're just gonna go
to Joel's house, okay,

00:33:13.482 --> 00:33:15.692
pretending to be the new pool cleaner.

00:33:15.776 --> 00:33:19.905
When you get there, you will simply
attempt to seduce Joel's wife.

00:33:19.989 --> 00:33:21.698
If she does not respond,

00:33:21.782 --> 00:33:23.867
you will simply
clean the pool and leave.

00:33:23.951 --> 00:33:25.911
That's it. It's just that simple.

00:33:25.995 --> 00:33:32.626
So you're not gonna, like,
try to touch my ass or anything?

00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:40.967
Listen. He will be at work.

00:33:41.844 --> 00:33:45.138
You will go by when he is not there,

00:33:45.806 --> 00:33:49.601
and you will pose as the pool cleaner

00:33:50.019 --> 00:33:52.270
trying to seduce the wife.

00:33:53.522 --> 00:33:54.940
(LAUGHING)

00:33:55.024 --> 00:33:56.858
I see. Yeah. I get it now.

00:33:56.943 --> 00:33:58.318
- It's so simple.
- BRAD: Yeah. I'm sorry. Cool.

00:33:58.402 --> 00:33:59.861
Yeah. You're not even gonna be there.

00:33:59.946 --> 00:34:01.738
DEAN: No, he will not be there.

00:34:01.822 --> 00:34:04.449
He will not be at the house.
You will be at the house.

00:34:04.533 --> 00:34:06.493
The wife will be at the house. He will...

00:34:06.577 --> 00:34:08.578
- BRAD: Not be...
- Not be at the house.

00:34:08.663 --> 00:34:12.082
Cool. No problem.
This is gonna be great.

00:34:12.166 --> 00:34:15.043
Now, I want you to remember
that she might not go for it.

00:34:15.127 --> 00:34:17.254
So, awesome, yeah.
No, I can hardly wait.

00:34:17.338 --> 00:34:19.172
- She might not go for it.
- This is going to be awesome.

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:22.884
Awesome. Hey, man,
if you know of anybody else

00:34:22.969 --> 00:34:27.764
who might need, you know, what I do,
like lonely housewives and shit,

00:34:27.848 --> 00:34:29.015
you think you could tell them
about me?

00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.434
Because I figure
if I can get enough of them,

00:34:31.519 --> 00:34:33.979
then maybe I could quit
my landscaping job.

00:34:34.063 --> 00:34:37.274
That would be awesome,
because I hate landscaping, dude,

00:34:37.358 --> 00:34:39.567
and I like getting laid a lot better.

00:34:39.652 --> 00:34:42.862
And I'm always seeing all kinds of
horny housewives out at the clubs,

00:34:42.947 --> 00:34:45.073
so, like I say,
if your wife has any housewife...

00:34:45.157 --> 00:34:48.326
Brad, you're killing me, man.
All right? Good talking to you.

00:34:48.411 --> 00:34:51.413
- All right.
- Good talking, all right, bro? Later.

00:34:51.497 --> 00:34:52.706
BRAD: Oh? You know what else
I was thinking, man?

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:55.292
- Later on, Brad. Good night, man.
- BRAD: All right, cool.

00:34:55.376 --> 00:34:58.795
Hey, let me give you a ride home.
You're not in any condition to drive.

00:34:58.879 --> 00:35:00.130
I know.

00:35:01.090 --> 00:35:03.842
This... Are you sure about this guy?
This...

00:35:04.343 --> 00:35:06.428
DEAN: Oh, yeah, man. He's real cool.

00:35:06.512 --> 00:35:08.763
He just gets a little fired up
before each job.

00:35:08.848 --> 00:35:11.516
It's just... He doesn't seem that bright.

00:35:12.393 --> 00:35:15.937
I mean, what do you expect?
He's a whore.

00:35:36.709 --> 00:35:37.667
CINDY: Hey.

00:35:37.752 --> 00:35:41.588
Wow, looks like you had
one of those nights, huh?

00:35:42.548 --> 00:35:44.215
So, where was I?

00:35:51.307 --> 00:35:53.183
Oh, shit.

00:35:54.810 --> 00:35:55.852
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

00:35:55.936 --> 00:35:57.520
- Hello?
- Hey, Dean.

00:35:57.605 --> 00:35:59.856
- Joel.
- Thank God you're awake.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.359
Did that really happen last night?

00:36:02.443 --> 00:36:05.612
We go through with that?
That gigolo stuff?

00:36:05.905 --> 00:36:07.072
As far as I know.

00:36:07.156 --> 00:36:09.783
- God damn it!
- What?

00:36:10.117 --> 00:36:13.036
What was I thinking?
We got to call that off right now.

00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:15.789
Can you call that guy?
What's his name?

00:36:16.082 --> 00:36:18.833
Brad. Okay. Yeah, man. I'll call him.

00:36:18.918 --> 00:36:21.127
Yeah, tell him I'll pay him anyway.
Not to... Not to worry about it.

00:36:21.212 --> 00:36:22.629
Just tell him not to go over there.

00:36:22.713 --> 00:36:24.714
What was I thinking?

00:36:24.799 --> 00:36:27.217
All right, chill. Chill. I'll call him.

00:36:27.301 --> 00:36:29.469
Thanks for the drugs, Dean.

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:35.850
Actually, I don't have his digits.

00:36:36.394 --> 00:36:38.186
What're you talking about?
Thought you called him last night.

00:36:38.270 --> 00:36:41.898
- Yeah, but I got his number from Cliff.
- You get it from Cliff again.

00:36:41.982 --> 00:36:45.402
Cliff doesn't have a phone right now.
I got it from him at the bar.

00:36:45.486 --> 00:36:47.153
Motherfucker!

00:36:49.490 --> 00:36:53.034
What's the boy's last name?
I'll call information.

00:36:53.828 --> 00:36:55.453
I don't remember. It's a Mexican name.

00:36:55.538 --> 00:36:56.621
Mexican?

00:36:56.705 --> 00:36:57.789
For Christ's sake, Dean,

00:36:57.873 --> 00:36:59.749
the guy's got blonde hair
and blue eyes. Come on.

00:36:59.834 --> 00:37:02.252
I thought it was strange, too,
a guy who looks like that

00:37:02.336 --> 00:37:05.338
had a Mexican last name,
but I don't judge people, you know?

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:08.758
I mean, might not have been Mexican.
Could have been a Filipino name.

00:37:08.843 --> 00:37:12.345
I think it's Lopez or Sanchez.

00:37:13.681 --> 00:37:14.806
Or Gutiérrez.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.684
Shit. I got to get home
and head him off.

00:37:18.686 --> 00:37:20.019
- Joel, we got to talk.
- Not now, Brian.

00:37:20.104 --> 00:37:21.104
- It's kind of important.
- Not now, pal.

00:37:21.188 --> 00:37:22.147
- Not now.
- It's kind of really important.

00:37:22.231 --> 00:37:23.398
- It's about Step.
- JENNY: There's a Brad Chavez

00:37:23.482 --> 00:37:25.233
on Line 1 for you.

00:37:27.570 --> 00:37:29.904
- Who?
- Brad Chavez.

00:37:30.489 --> 00:37:31.948
Brad Chavez?

00:37:32.032 --> 00:37:33.533
You want me to take a message?

00:37:33.617 --> 00:37:37.495
No, no. That's the pool cleaner.
I better take that.

00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.498
Hello?

00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:42.459
- Hey, is this Joel?
- Yes, it is.

00:37:42.543 --> 00:37:44.669
- Hey, man. It's Brad.
- Hey. Thank God.

00:37:44.753 --> 00:37:46.212
Mission accomplished, dude.

00:37:46.297 --> 00:37:48.882
It worked. She totally went for it.

00:37:49.925 --> 00:37:53.845
You were not even supposed
to be there for another 45 minutes.

00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:56.389
Oh, really? Yeah.

00:37:57.391 --> 00:37:59.309
I totally forgot what time
you guys told me,

00:37:59.393 --> 00:38:02.854
and I was so excited about it
I just went over there.

00:38:04.398 --> 00:38:05.565
Um...

00:38:06.567 --> 00:38:10.570
So, then, you... She actually...
You guys...

00:38:10.654 --> 00:38:12.363
Yep. It was easy.

00:38:13.282 --> 00:38:15.742
Easy? What does that mean, easy?

00:38:16.827 --> 00:38:20.330
No, I don't mean easy like
she was easy or anything like,

00:38:20.414 --> 00:38:22.624
"Your wife's a slut," or anything.

00:38:22.708 --> 00:38:25.585
I just meant it wasn't hard
to get her to...

00:38:26.712 --> 00:38:27.670
Never mind.

00:38:27.755 --> 00:38:30.632
Tell me. Tell me what happened.
I want to hear it all.

00:38:30.716 --> 00:38:32.884
- You sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

00:38:33.761 --> 00:38:37.305
Okay. Well, she let me in,

00:38:37.932 --> 00:38:40.016
so I just went back
like I was cleaning the pool,

00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:42.727
and I don't know anything
about pool cleaning, right?

00:38:42.811 --> 00:38:45.230
So, I was totally just faking it,

00:38:45.648 --> 00:38:47.273
and she was in her bathing suit,

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.943
so I struck up a conversation.

00:38:50.694 --> 00:38:52.529
This is a really nice house.

00:38:52.613 --> 00:38:53.988
Thank you.

00:38:54.448 --> 00:38:56.366
Is it your dad's house?

00:38:56.784 --> 00:38:58.535
No, it's... It's ours.

00:38:58.619 --> 00:39:01.454
Oh. Wow.

00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:05.833
You look so young
to be living in a house this nice.

00:39:05.918 --> 00:39:06.918
(GIGGLING)

00:39:07.002 --> 00:39:08.336
What?

00:39:09.004 --> 00:39:13.132
Do you have any sunscreen?
I forgot mine.

00:39:14.009 --> 00:39:15.426
Sure.

00:39:15.511 --> 00:39:17.345
BRAD: And, see, I thought that was
pretty smart of me, right,

00:39:17.429 --> 00:39:19.055
to ask to borrow the sunscreen,

00:39:19.139 --> 00:39:22.642
because that way I could ask
if she wanted some

00:39:22.726 --> 00:39:24.727
and I could rub some
on her back, right?

00:39:24.812 --> 00:39:27.063
Instead of me just coming out
and asking to rub some on her back.

00:39:27.147 --> 00:39:29.691
It was pretty smooth, huh?

00:39:29.775 --> 00:39:34.279
Anyway, once I started rubbing lotion
all over her body,

00:39:34.363 --> 00:39:36.573
- the rest was pretty easy. She...
- All right! That's it!

00:39:36.657 --> 00:39:38.616
Stop it! I don't need to hear any more.

00:39:38.701 --> 00:39:40.410
Okay. Okay, dude.

00:39:40.494 --> 00:39:44.289
Well, hey, listen,
if you have anyone else that

00:39:44.373 --> 00:39:47.709
you want to referral me to

00:39:47.793 --> 00:39:50.878
or, like, if you want me to do
your wife again, I can...

00:39:50.963 --> 00:39:53.214
No! I've got to go. Goodbye.

00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.764
- Oh! Damn it!
- Yoo-hoo. Hey!

00:40:05.853 --> 00:40:07.854
- How's it going?
- I'm real busy, actually.

00:40:07.938 --> 00:40:10.106
Well, I'm not gonna keep you long.

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.067
I went ahead
and got those tickets for that dinner

00:40:13.152 --> 00:40:16.154
we talked about going to together
on the seventh.

00:40:16.238 --> 00:40:18.865
I think I mentioned
that they were 40 apiece.

00:40:18.949 --> 00:40:22.744
Well, as it turns out,
they're a tad more this year. 55.

00:40:22.828 --> 00:40:24.704
I told you that we really
didn't want to go to that thing.

00:40:24.788 --> 00:40:25.788
Don't you remember that?

00:40:25.873 --> 00:40:28.458
I know you said something
about Suzie feeling uncomfortable,

00:40:28.542 --> 00:40:31.586
but like I say,
she won't feel uncomfortable at all.

00:40:31.670 --> 00:40:34.339
She could wear a pantsuit,
if that's the issue.

00:40:34.423 --> 00:40:37.550
- It's not formal or anything.
- No. It's not the problem, Nathan.

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:40.803
What? Does she not like
to wear a dress ever?

00:40:40.888 --> 00:40:42.388
I gotta go.

00:40:42.473 --> 00:40:45.558
One more thing! I'm busy, too.

00:40:56.111 --> 00:41:00.365
Joel, I was thinking,
maybe we could go on vacation,

00:41:00.908 --> 00:41:02.200
just the two of us.

00:41:02.284 --> 00:41:04.577
We haven't done something like that
in a long time,

00:41:04.662 --> 00:41:07.789
and I know they have really
great deals right now in the Caribbean.

00:41:07.873 --> 00:41:09.749
I hate the Caribbean.

00:41:10.459 --> 00:41:11.834
Really? Why?

00:41:11.919 --> 00:41:13.586
'Cause it sucks.

00:41:15.422 --> 00:41:18.174
But I thought you liked
going to hot places,

00:41:18.258 --> 00:41:20.677
you know, so you can wear your shorts.

00:41:20.761 --> 00:41:23.763
I don't feel so good.
I'm gonna go to bed.

00:41:24.973 --> 00:41:26.599
Is it the food?

00:41:44.118 --> 00:41:47.203
Well, actually, I'm in, like,
five bands right now,

00:41:47.287 --> 00:41:50.540
but God's Cock is basically
the same four guys as Fight Head,

00:41:50.624 --> 00:41:53.626
but Fight Head's more of, like,
a thrash skate-punk-type thing,

00:41:53.711 --> 00:41:57.046
whereas God's Cock is more like
melodic grindcore.

00:41:57.131 --> 00:42:00.591
So, it's five bands,
but it's four groups of guys.

00:42:02.177 --> 00:42:05.430
She is so nice.
I wish they'd hire more people like her.

00:42:05.514 --> 00:42:06.764
Mmm-hmm.

00:42:07.307 --> 00:42:10.059
Can't believe he's still working here.

00:42:10.144 --> 00:42:12.395
Did you know
that Sylvia's wallet is missing?

00:42:12.479 --> 00:42:14.063
She thinks it was stolen.

00:42:14.148 --> 00:42:16.107
And guess who was
in the locker room last?

00:42:16.191 --> 00:42:17.567
Hector.

00:42:19.319 --> 00:42:20.737
Hey. Did you guys hear the rumor?

00:42:20.821 --> 00:42:22.488
Jim said Joel and Brian
are going to sell the company.

00:42:22.573 --> 00:42:24.240
Rich said the same thing, too.

00:42:24.324 --> 00:42:27.243
He said they'll probably make millions
and billions of dollars, too.

00:42:27.327 --> 00:42:28.911
Shut the fuck up.

00:42:28.996 --> 00:42:29.996
You mean, I'm working my ass off

00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:31.706
and those guys are gonna make
all that money?

00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:33.583
I work harder than anybody.

00:42:33.667 --> 00:42:37.420
If you add it all up,
I lift over 200,000 pounds a week.

00:42:37.504 --> 00:42:38.713
We should do something.

00:42:38.797 --> 00:42:40.131
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:42:40.215 --> 00:42:43.176
Here. Ladies are free,
so bring some chicks.

00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:44.802
GABRIELLA: Mmm-hmm.

00:42:46.096 --> 00:42:47.472
- You got a sec?
- Yeah.

00:42:47.556 --> 00:42:49.223
I think we might have
a really big problem here.

00:42:49.308 --> 00:42:50.600
I don't know what happened,
but all of a sudden,

00:42:50.684 --> 00:42:52.769
Step says he doesn't want
to settle anymore.

00:42:52.853 --> 00:42:54.729
I think he might have talked to a lawyer.

00:42:54.813 --> 00:42:57.440
Like I say, the General Mills guys
don't wanna make the offer official

00:42:57.524 --> 00:42:59.233
until this whole thing is settled, so...

00:42:59.318 --> 00:43:01.736
All right, well, don't worry about it.

00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:03.613
Step's probably just chest-beating,
you know?

00:43:03.697 --> 00:43:05.740
He does this all the time.
He gets all wound up, talks big,

00:43:05.824 --> 00:43:07.283
and then he usually backs down.

00:43:07.367 --> 00:43:09.494
And that was with his balls, so,

00:43:09.578 --> 00:43:12.747
- I'll talk to him.
- Okay. All right. The sooner the better.

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:17.543
(NATHAN EXCLAIMS)

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.337
There he is. Hey.

00:43:20.547 --> 00:43:22.381
I can't talk today.

00:43:23.050 --> 00:43:25.301
- Almost missed you.
- I can't talk right now, Nathan.

00:43:25.385 --> 00:43:27.637
Hey, I noticed you got
a new pool cleaner today.

00:43:27.721 --> 00:43:28.888
How is he?

00:43:28.972 --> 00:43:30.681
We're thinking about
changing services.

00:43:30.766 --> 00:43:34.644
I got to get inside...
Hang on, you mean yesterday, right?

00:43:34.728 --> 00:43:36.354
- Huh?
- The pool cleaner that you saw,

00:43:36.438 --> 00:43:38.564
you saw him yesterday,
not today, right?

00:43:38.649 --> 00:43:40.650
No, today. The new guy.

00:43:43.278 --> 00:43:44.737
What did he look like?

00:43:44.822 --> 00:43:47.532
Well, you know,
blonde-haired kid about yea high.

00:43:47.616 --> 00:43:50.159
Good-looking kid. Real good-looking.

00:43:50.244 --> 00:43:51.494
In fact, Leslie even commented...

00:43:51.578 --> 00:43:53.663
You're absolutely sure
that you saw him today,

00:43:53.747 --> 00:43:55.081
and not yesterday?

00:43:55.165 --> 00:43:56.541
- Yeah.
- No doubt?

00:43:56.625 --> 00:43:59.669
No, no doubt about it. It was today.
I came home for lunch.

00:43:59.753 --> 00:44:02.421
Yesterday, I had this bear of
a sales conference.

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.507
This guy just went on.

00:44:04.925 --> 00:44:08.177
Hey, do you think I could go ahead
and get that check from you?

00:44:08.262 --> 00:44:10.429
It's 110...

00:44:10.806 --> 00:44:12.807

00:44:16.645 --> 00:44:18.104
- Yeah, is this Brad?
- Yeah.

00:44:18.188 --> 00:44:19.605
What were you doing
at my house today?

00:44:21.149 --> 00:44:22.233
Oh!

00:44:24.945 --> 00:44:26.779
- Nothing.
- Bullshit.

00:44:27.447 --> 00:44:29.782
Look, don't worry about it, dude.

00:44:30.617 --> 00:44:31.617
I won't charge you for this one.

00:44:31.785 --> 00:44:33.703
You had sex with my wife again?

00:44:33.787 --> 00:44:38.541
Well, I figured we already did it once,
so what's the big deal, right?

00:44:38.625 --> 00:44:41.878
- Besides, I'm not going to charge you.
- You're not going to charge...

00:44:41.962 --> 00:44:43.713
You are going to charge me
and I am going to pay you,

00:44:43.797 --> 00:44:46.424
because you are not going to have sex
with my wife for free, all right?

00:44:46.508 --> 00:44:50.219
Now, listen. If I ever catch you
anywhere near my house ever again,

00:44:50.304 --> 00:44:52.597
it's not going to be great, all right?

00:44:52.681 --> 00:44:56.309
Okay, listen, if you know
of anyone else who needs...

00:45:01.273 --> 00:45:02.899
Hey, do you want to,

00:45:03.358 --> 00:45:05.151
I don't know, go out or something?

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:07.570
We can go to 7-Eleven
and get pizza sticks.

00:45:07.654 --> 00:45:10.031
I have this work thing I gotta go to.

00:45:10.490 --> 00:45:12.867
Rory's band's playing.
Everyone's got to go.

00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:13.678
I cannot believe
that my wife slept with that guy.

00:46:14.763 --> 00:46:16.305
I thought you said
it wouldn't bother you.

00:46:16.390 --> 00:46:18.975
Well, I guess
I didn't think about it long enough.

00:46:19.059 --> 00:46:21.978
It was so easy for him, too.
I can't stand that.

00:46:22.062 --> 00:46:23.771
Maybe I'm just lousy in the sack.

00:46:23.855 --> 00:46:25.314
No, man. It's not your fault.

00:46:25.399 --> 00:46:28.734
I told you,
my man Brad just crushes ass, dude.

00:46:29.861 --> 00:46:32.321
I'm sorry if, you know... I'm sorry.

That's all right. That's all right.
Apparently you're right.

What is it with women?
They say they don't care about looks,

00:46:37.619 --> 00:46:38.869
they just want a guy
who's smart and funny,

00:46:38.954 --> 00:46:40.830
but they always just end up laughing

- For real? Why?
- Why do you think?

00:46:52.384 --> 00:46:56.012
Unreal. You hire a guy to do a job
on one day,

00:46:56.096 --> 00:47:01.183
and he comes back the next day,
drops it in your wife again for free.

Yeah, well, I'm not letting him do it
for free. I am paying him.

Well, I mean,
should I contact Brad for my 20 bills

or should I go to you, or...

Don't even worry about that right now.

with the economics of it later.

and I'm a little bit of a character,

Okay? So, I want you to listen to me.

00:47:45.187 --> 00:47:47.938
You should try smoking a little pot.

- That's a drug.
- It's not a drug. It's a flower.

00:47:52.527 --> 00:47:56.614
It has healing properties.
Stress is a killer.

got a beer, or even some wine...

00:48:56.424 --> 00:48:57.842
- It's not really my thing.
- Bullshit.

00:48:57.926 --> 00:49:00.678
Come on, Joel.
Man, he thinks he gets paranoid.

00:49:00.762 --> 00:49:02.680
- I do get paranoid.
- Okay.

00:49:03.306 --> 00:49:05.307
You familiar with the Graffix bong?

00:49:05.392 --> 00:49:07.184
- You ever used one before?
- No.

00:49:07.269 --> 00:49:09.728
Okay. Put your thumb right here.

00:49:09.813 --> 00:49:13.065
Hey! You put your right thumb here,
on the carburetor.

00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:19.280
Now, when I tell you to let go,
I want you to let go and inhale hard.

00:49:19.906 --> 00:49:21.323
Okay. Exhale!

00:49:22.409 --> 00:49:23.784
- I'm going to let you guys do this.
- Bullshit!

00:49:23.869 --> 00:49:25.035
This doesn't work for me.
Just give mine to Dean.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.037
- Exhale hard!
- I get paranoid, so I don't...

00:49:27.122 --> 00:49:28.664
Exhale!

00:49:28.748 --> 00:49:30.082

Man, you do get paranoid
when you get stoned.

when he jumped at you?

Hey, dude, man.
You should call that girl now.

00:51:01.967 --> 00:51:02.967
Well, yeah, what time is it?

00:51:03.051 --> 00:51:06.428
Time for you to call her
and finally get laid, man. Come on!

00:51:06.513 --> 00:51:08.055
- All right.
- DEAN: It's 12:30, man.

00:51:08.139 --> 00:51:09.932
She's probably at home now.

00:51:13.061 --> 00:51:14.478
What does she look like?

00:51:14.562 --> 00:51:19.858
She's... She has dark hair.
She's kind of pretty,

00:51:19.943 --> 00:51:23.028
and, you know, working-class looking.

00:51:25.573 --> 00:51:27.157
What do you mean by that?

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:36.959
That she's kind of slutty-looking?

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:44.633
Kind of. Yeah.

doesn't have call waiting.

You do get paranoid
when you are stoned, huh?

00:52:42.776 --> 00:52:47.529
Seriously, though, I hate call waiting.

00:52:47.614 --> 00:52:48.822
Okay, man.

00:52:49.449 --> 00:52:53.035
You're too stoned.
I'm gonna dial the number for you.

00:53:03.713 --> 00:53:07.132
I'll tell you
why you're getting a busy signal.

This is my number.

you're trying to get me so paranoid.

Thanks for having me. It's been cool.

See you guys later.

Oh, my God. Joel, are you all right?
What happened?

00:54:16.703 --> 00:54:22.040
I'm fine. I'm fine. Just got
my ass kicked. Just back to sleep.

00:54:22.667 --> 00:54:24.835
- But...
- Honey, just...

00:54:24.919 --> 00:54:26.336
By who? What happened?

Some guy at Sidelines, just...
Night-night.

My God, you should go to the hospital
so you can get checked out, maybe.

No, no, no, I just
want to go to sleep right now. Shh!

- Are you sure you're okay?
- Honey, just don't worry about it, okay?

every day. Not a big deal. Back to bed.

- Can I get you some ice?
- I'm set.

Oh, my God.

Not returning my calls.

00:55:05.210 --> 00:55:09.213
Oh, shit. We got trouble.
He did talk to a lawyer.

you see on all the bus-stop bench ads.

He's got that freak-show hairdo.
I mean, you got to see this guy.

00:55:16.763 --> 00:55:18.430
He is a human turd.

00:55:20.767 --> 00:55:22.643
Shit. What happened to you?

00:55:22.727 --> 00:55:25.062
I fell down some stairs. Joe Adler?

00:55:25.146 --> 00:55:27.231
Yeah. I mean,
this could be a real problem.

00:55:27.315 --> 00:55:28.899
We could be really screwed here.

00:55:29.442 --> 00:55:33.070
(SIGHS) And we got to hire a couple of
new people because Cindy's quitting.

00:55:33.154 --> 00:55:35.781
And did you know
she's been going out with Step?

00:55:38.785 --> 00:55:39.826
What?

- Yeah.

- I know. Weird.

And they didn't even meet here.

00:55:46.334 --> 00:55:49.586
They met, like, at some grocery store
or something, totally random.

You know, how a jimmy-john
little dingle berry like him

ends up with a girl like Cindy
is beyond me.

I'd like to go ahead and fire Hector.

00:56:08.481 --> 00:56:10.482
It's got to be him. Who else could it be?

Uh, no. Do not fire Hector.

00:56:15.321 --> 00:56:17.948
- Why not?
- Just... Just trust me on this.

look worse than mine if...

near my house or my wife again,

that she doesn't even know
that I paid you to have sex with her?

and I tell her right now

Did he do a good job cleaning the pool?

Well, I...

00:58:48.808 --> 00:58:51.893
Did he get all the leaves?
'Cause it doesn't look really clean.

It doesn't look like he did a good job.

we're going to be using him anymore.

- Okay?

Can I take you to the doctor?

Nope!

- No, thank you!

01:00:33.788 --> 01:00:34.996
Step, I don't want to tell you what to do,

01:00:35.081 --> 01:00:37.749
but I just want you
to think about this, you know.

01:00:38.543 --> 01:00:41.753
If you go beyond the settlement,
you continue with the lawsuit,

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.672
you could bankrupt that company.

01:00:43.756 --> 01:00:45.549
And people are going to lose their jobs,

01:00:45.633 --> 01:00:47.592
a lot of people are gonna be
pissed off at you, so...

01:00:47.677 --> 01:00:49.678
No, I ain't worried about that.

01:00:49.762 --> 01:00:52.389
I can kick anybody's ass
at that whole company.

01:00:53.099 --> 01:00:54.140
Yeah.

01:00:54.225 --> 01:00:57.769
PHIL: Well, I'm gonna kick somebody's
ass if you don't close that screen door!

01:00:58.938 --> 01:01:00.146
Brad, we can't. I'm sorry.

01:01:00.231 --> 01:01:02.482
- We have to stop doing this.
- Why?

01:01:02.567 --> 01:01:05.318
Because it's not right,
and I feel horrible,

01:01:05.403 --> 01:01:08.029
and you have to start cleaning the pool.

01:01:08.281 --> 01:01:09.865
(FLIES BUZZING)

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:15.871
But I've never felt this way
about anyone before,

01:01:15.955 --> 01:01:18.164
and I've been with a lot of chicks.

01:01:19.834 --> 01:01:25.547
Okay, look, Brad.
I love my husband. I really do.

01:01:25.631 --> 01:01:30.010
And this was a mistake. I'm sorry.
I don't know what got into me.

01:01:30.094 --> 01:01:36.224
I was bored and frustrated,
and I was not feeling particularly pretty.

01:01:36.309 --> 01:01:38.476
But we just... We have to stop this.

01:01:38.936 --> 01:01:42.355
This has made me realize
I really want to make my marriage work.

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:44.608
I'm sorry.

01:01:44.942 --> 01:01:47.861
This doesn't mean that we can't still
see each other, though, right?

01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:51.948
Yes, that's...
That's exactly what it means.

01:01:52.825 --> 01:01:53.992
Why?

01:01:55.369 --> 01:01:58.079
Because of everything that I just said.

01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.207
Do you need me to say it again?

01:02:02.001 --> 01:02:03.251
(SIGHS)

01:02:03.461 --> 01:02:04.920
Can I see you tomorrow?

01:02:05.296 --> 01:02:07.130
- No.
- Can I see you Thursday?

01:02:07.214 --> 01:02:08.757
- No.
- Can I see you Friday?

01:02:08.841 --> 01:02:11.343
Okay. You know what?
You have to go. Come on.

01:02:13.179 --> 01:02:16.348
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Okay. Okay. Just... Okay.

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.933
We'll talk about it later.

01:02:20.311 --> 01:02:22.520
Oh, my God. What a moron.

01:02:26.901 --> 01:02:28.401
- Hey. Are you ready?
- Huh?

01:02:28.486 --> 01:02:31.029
The meeting with Step's lawyer,
or lawyers.

01:02:31.364 --> 01:02:33.823
- It's today, remember? Now.
- Shit.

01:02:33.908 --> 01:02:36.368
I should fire all three of you

01:02:36.452 --> 01:02:40.163
because you laughed at me
when I bought those bus-bench ads.

01:02:40.247 --> 01:02:43.708
But this Step guy? He's the Holy Grail.

01:02:44.335 --> 01:02:48.838
You see, if both his balls
had been knocked clean off,

01:02:48.923 --> 01:02:51.841
he'd be a good case,
but not a great case.

01:02:51.926 --> 01:02:54.803
A man with no balls is no man at all.

01:02:54.887 --> 01:02:57.263
And a jury will never feel
they can walk in the shoes

01:02:57.348 --> 01:03:00.100
of a ball-less, neutered, he-she freak.

01:03:00.601 --> 01:03:05.021
But Step? He's got one ball, barely.

01:03:05.106 --> 01:03:11.569
To a jury he's still a man, and that
manhood is hanging on by a thread.

01:03:11.946 --> 01:03:15.281
I'm telling you,
this guy is a Powerball jackpot.

01:03:15.366 --> 01:03:16.700
The fucking...

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:20.245
Hello. I'm Joe Adler.

01:03:21.372 --> 01:03:23.665
- Hi, Joe. Brian. This is Joel.
- Nice to see you.

01:03:23.749 --> 01:03:24.749
- How are you?
- Hi.

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:26.042
You see those guys up there?

01:03:26.127 --> 01:03:28.294
I heard those are the guys
from General Mills.

01:03:28.379 --> 01:03:31.256
Look, if they're gonna sell this place
and cash out and leave me with no job,

01:03:31.340 --> 01:03:33.049
then I should get some
of that cash, man.

01:03:33.134 --> 01:03:34.259
I mean, it's only fair.

01:03:34.343 --> 01:03:36.302
I've been working here for,
like, two years.

01:03:36.387 --> 01:03:38.972
It's bullshit, man. I work my ass off.

01:03:39.056 --> 01:03:41.349
Remember, Hector, I was telling you
how hard I worked my ass off?

01:03:41.434 --> 01:03:45.478
I've been working here 14 years.
We can get jobs at GemCo like that.

01:03:45.563 --> 01:03:47.856
And at GemCo,
all the employees are owners.

01:03:47.940 --> 01:03:49.691
It even says so on the nametags.

01:03:49.775 --> 01:03:51.651
But the thing is,
I don't want to work at GemCo.

01:03:51.736 --> 01:03:53.236
GemCo sucks, man.

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:55.405
They make you do calisthenics. Yeah.

01:03:55.489 --> 01:03:58.366
That's right.
We could work at Southwest Airlines.

01:03:58.451 --> 01:04:00.326
But I don't want to work
at Southwest, either.

01:04:00.411 --> 01:04:02.287
They make you do the limbo.

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:03.705
That is messed up.

01:04:03.789 --> 01:04:06.374
Yeah, I would be the laughingstock
of the grindcore community.

01:04:06.459 --> 01:04:08.334
If we quit, this place couldn't run.

01:04:08.419 --> 01:04:10.879
They wouldn't be able to sell this place
for anything.

01:04:10.963 --> 01:04:15.383
Well, that's why what we should do is,
is we should all go on strike,

01:04:15.468 --> 01:04:18.720
demand stock in the company
before it sells.

01:04:19.138 --> 01:04:20.847
If General Mills knew
that we were on strike,

01:04:20.931 --> 01:04:24.142
they would not buy this place
until that strike was over.

01:04:24.769 --> 01:04:28.354
See, that way, Joel and Brian
would have to give us stock.

01:04:30.524 --> 01:04:33.568
Yeah. We should do it.
We should strike.

01:04:33.652 --> 01:04:35.653
That's what I've been saying
this whole time.

01:04:36.822 --> 01:04:38.406
We've gone through everything,

01:04:38.491 --> 01:04:41.910
and the only way we would even
consider a settlement

01:04:41.994 --> 01:04:45.246
would be to the tune of the number
you see on the bottom of Page 18.

01:04:45.331 --> 01:04:46.956
Does everyone have this?

01:04:50.878 --> 01:04:51.920
What?

01:04:52.004 --> 01:04:54.089
We don't have this kind of money,
not even close.

01:04:54.173 --> 01:04:56.341
Not in cash, you don't. Of course not.

01:04:56.842 --> 01:05:00.428
But if you were to sell off your assets,
the property lease, the equipment...

01:05:00.513 --> 01:05:02.931
Are you... Are you shitting me?
This would bankrupt us.

01:05:03.015 --> 01:05:04.599
This is what I've been trying
to tell you about, Joel.

01:05:04.683 --> 01:05:06.726
If you think that I'm just going to give up

01:05:06.811 --> 01:05:08.770
this entire company
that I've built from the ground up...

01:05:08.854 --> 01:05:10.855
How about what my client gave up?

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:14.192
His testicles! How about that?

01:05:14.568 --> 01:05:16.528
In fact, I'll make a deal with you.

01:05:17.321 --> 01:05:19.781
We will drop this case right now

01:05:19.865 --> 01:05:24.744
if you come over here
and put your testicles right here

01:05:24.829 --> 01:05:27.205
and let me slam this door like this!

01:05:28.374 --> 01:05:31.459
Go ahead. We can settle this right now.

01:05:31.544 --> 01:05:34.963
Call it even.
I will drop this case right now

01:05:35.047 --> 01:05:39.259
if you let me slam your balls
in this door,

01:05:39.343 --> 01:05:41.803

to my client!

01:05:41.887 --> 01:05:44.889
Yep. Those are definitely the guys
from General Mills.

a negotiation going on right there.

01:05:48.853 --> 01:05:51.312
That is definitely
what that looks like to me.

01:05:51.397 --> 01:05:53.356
What are we going to do?
I got car payments.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.233
They're going to take away my Geo.
They've done it before.

01:05:55.317 --> 01:05:57.652
We got to act fast.
They could be about to close the deal.

01:05:57.736 --> 01:06:00.405

We need to do one of those walkouts.
That's what we need to do.

Basically, we were...
We were thinking...

01:07:16.982 --> 01:07:22.070
We were just thinking...
Well, Rory had initially pointed out

01:07:22.154 --> 01:07:25.156
that you guys are doing this deal
with General Mills,

01:07:26.283 --> 01:07:31.329
and we just think that...
Well, we were considering the idea...

01:07:31.413 --> 01:07:34.415
We think that maybe
we should get a piece of it.

01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:37.919
And, you know,
so what we decided is...

01:07:38.003 --> 01:07:40.296
What everybody has decided is
that if we don't,

01:07:40.381 --> 01:07:44.425
then what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna...

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:47.971
Hang on. You want a piece? Right?

01:07:48.430 --> 01:07:50.765
- Yeah.
- Yeah, if we could.

Listen, Joel,
I need to tell you something.

01:08:52.244 --> 01:08:55.830
You've been really busy at the factory
for the last couple years,

01:08:55.914 --> 01:08:58.958
and ever since
I started working at home,

01:08:59.043 --> 01:09:01.753
it seems like, I don't know,
maybe I just wasn't feeling

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.505
- as pretty as I used to feel, and I just...
- You banged the pool cleaner.

01:09:04.590 --> 01:09:05.715
- What?
- Is that what you're trying to tell me?

01:09:05.799 --> 01:09:07.467
You had sex with Brad.

01:09:09.053 --> 01:09:10.887
- You knew?
- Yeah, I knew. I hired him.

01:09:10.971 --> 01:09:12.805
Yeah, I know you hired him,
but how did you know that...

01:09:12.890 --> 01:09:16.517
I didn't hire him to clean the pool.
I hired him to have sex with you.

01:09:16.602 --> 01:09:17.602
What?

01:09:19.646 --> 01:09:21.981
Wait... Why?

01:09:24.443 --> 01:09:26.694
I hired him to have an affair with you,

01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:30.698
because I wanted to have an affair
and not feel guilty,

01:09:30.783 --> 01:09:35.161
but I was very, very drunk, and I was
on some kind of a horse tranquilizer.

01:10:03.982 --> 01:10:07.193
Dean, you know, he gave me some pill.

01:10:07.903 --> 01:10:09.237
God, you asshole.

01:10:09.321 --> 01:10:10.905
- I'm the asshole?
- Yes! I'm leaving.

01:10:10.989 --> 01:10:12.323
Suzie, technically
I didn't even do anything.

01:10:12.408 --> 01:10:14.075
You could've just said,
"No, thanks, just clean the pool."

01:10:14.159 --> 01:10:16.077
None of this would've happened
if you hadn't hired him.

01:10:16.161 --> 01:10:18.663
Hey, guys. Glad I caught you.

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:21.332
You guys hardly ever answer the door.

01:10:21.417 --> 01:10:23.584
- Now's not a really good time.
- I'm leaving.

01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:26.754
When do you think
would be a good time, you think?

01:10:26.839 --> 01:10:28.756
I don't know. I don't know.

01:10:28.841 --> 01:10:30.758
- See, the thing is...
- How about tomorrow?

01:10:30.843 --> 01:10:32.135
- You want to come by tomorrow?
- Great.

01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:33.886
- Okay?
- What time?

01:10:34.721 --> 01:10:36.639
I don't know. Just sometime tomorrow
would be great.

01:10:36.723 --> 01:10:40.518
Okay, great. So, if you could go and
have that check, that would be great.

01:10:40.602 --> 01:10:42.353
- It's 110.
- Okay.

01:10:42.438 --> 01:10:45.606
- That's two plates at $55 a plate.
- Okay, okay.

01:10:45.691 --> 01:10:47.400
- I'm going to close this.
- Okay.

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.682
(INAUDIBLE)

01:11:45.292 --> 01:11:46.626
- Joel?
- Hi.

01:11:46.710 --> 01:11:50.213
Hey, what...
How did you know that I was here?

01:11:50.297 --> 01:11:53.007
I'm actually staying here, too.
I thought I saw you, so...

01:11:53.091 --> 01:11:54.175
Come in. Sorry.

01:11:54.259 --> 01:11:57.720
Do you want something to drink?
I have soda.

01:11:58.096 --> 01:11:59.263
No, thanks.

01:11:59.973 --> 01:12:02.767
Listen, I am so sorry
about what happened with Willie.

01:12:02.851 --> 01:12:05.937
He gets crazy.
That's why I had to move out,

01:12:06.021 --> 01:12:08.397
so, have a seat.

01:12:11.276 --> 01:12:13.569
- That's Mary's purse, right?
- Huh?

01:12:13.654 --> 01:12:16.280
Right there. That's Mary's purse, right?

01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:21.994
Uh, no, that's my bag. So, wait. How are
things at work? How is everybody?

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:31.587
This is Mary's purse, and you stole it.

01:12:32.047 --> 01:12:33.214
Am I right?

01:12:34.299 --> 01:12:38.261
Joel, that's my bag.
It probably just looks like hers.

01:12:38.804 --> 01:12:40.555
You know,
there's a lot of them out there.

01:12:40.639 --> 01:12:42.473
I have never seen another one.

01:12:43.475 --> 01:12:46.018
Or another teddy in a fucking tutu.

01:12:48.939 --> 01:12:52.692
- Now, what are you doing with Step?
- Huh?

01:12:52.776 --> 01:12:55.152
You're the only reason
that he's suing this company, right?

01:12:55.237 --> 01:12:59.073
Do you have any idea how much work
I put into building up that company?

01:12:59.157 --> 01:13:01.284
Do you have any clue? Do you care?

01:13:02.786 --> 01:13:04.662
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna take this.

01:13:04.746 --> 01:13:06.372
If it really is your bag,
you can call the police,

01:13:06.456 --> 01:13:08.541
you can tell them that I stole it.
All right?

01:13:09.835 --> 01:13:11.419
On second thought,
I'm gonna call them right now

01:13:11.503 --> 01:13:13.504
and I'm gonna tell them
that you stole it.

01:13:16.341 --> 01:13:19.010
- Joel, please don't.
- Why?

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:21.929
Joel, please don't call the police.
I'm on probation,

01:13:22.014 --> 01:13:24.265
and I will go to jail for a really long time.

01:13:24.349 --> 01:13:25.433
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that

01:13:25.517 --> 01:13:27.310
before you started
ripping off my employees.

01:13:27.394 --> 01:13:29.729
Joel, please? Listen, I promise you

01:13:29.813 --> 01:13:32.023
I will leave Step alone
and he will drop the lawsuit.

01:13:32.107 --> 01:13:33.441
How do I know that?

01:13:34.234 --> 01:13:35.651
You can keep the bag.

01:13:35.736 --> 01:13:38.946
If I don't leave Step alone,
if he doesn't drop the lawsuit,

01:13:39.031 --> 01:13:40.865
then you can turn me in.

01:13:45.203 --> 01:13:48.623
Yeah, that...
And Sylvia's wallet and Jim's watch?

01:13:48.707 --> 01:13:50.625
You got those? Can I have those, too?

01:13:55.589 --> 01:13:59.759
I guess that works. I mean, great.

01:14:01.678 --> 01:14:04.263
I bet you weren't even
into food flavoring, were you?

01:14:04.348 --> 01:14:05.598
Mmm-mmm.

01:14:06.058 --> 01:14:08.934
What is your deal?
How do you end up like this?

01:14:09.519 --> 01:14:10.811
(SOBBING)

01:14:11.271 --> 01:14:12.355
Hey?

01:14:13.273 --> 01:14:15.191
Hey? This is what I'm talking about.

01:14:15.275 --> 01:14:18.444
This manipulation here with the tears.
I'm not gonna fall for that.

01:14:18.528 --> 01:14:19.654
Forget it.

01:14:20.864 --> 01:14:24.575
You better not be faking it, okay,
because I'm actually feeling bad.

01:14:25.243 --> 01:14:26.285
Hello?

01:14:30.082 --> 01:14:31.415
Are you faking it?

01:14:34.419 --> 01:14:40.299
Well, I'm sorry. You know, I just...
You know, I just...

01:14:41.176 --> 01:14:44.011
I was just curious about
how somebody ends up like this.

01:14:44.096 --> 01:14:45.471
All right. Just...

01:14:47.099 --> 01:14:48.474
(SHUSHING)

01:14:49.267 --> 01:14:53.020
Very sorry. Okay? Don't worry about it.

01:14:54.773 --> 01:14:57.692
I just thought I'd just ask how a...

01:15:21.299 --> 01:15:23.718
Cindy? Cindy?

01:15:25.762 --> 01:15:26.887
Shit.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:50.327
(SINGING) Who were you thinking of
when we were making love last night?

01:15:52.497 --> 01:15:56.876
Was it a good-looking stranger
or a close friend of mine?

01:15:59.796 --> 01:16:05.509
You didn't want to quit
when we was into it last night

01:16:08.972 --> 01:16:11.849
Joel hasn't been in all morning.
Can you believe that?

01:16:12.392 --> 01:16:14.477
If we come in late, we get in trouble.

01:16:14.561 --> 01:16:15.644
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:16.229 --> 01:16:17.480
(GASPS)

01:16:18.815 --> 01:16:21.275
And Hector didn't steal it. Cindy did.

01:16:24.196 --> 01:16:25.488
Can you believe that?

01:16:25.572 --> 01:16:28.824
Blaming Cindy just to protect Hector.
Typical.

01:16:34.998 --> 01:16:38.000
We really do need to go
to the grocery store, Step.

01:16:41.254 --> 01:16:42.922
You heard from Cindy lately?

01:16:43.006 --> 01:16:46.008
It's been over three days
since she borrowed your truck.

01:16:46.843 --> 01:16:48.761
Maybe we ought to call the cops
or something...

01:16:48.845 --> 01:16:52.598
Look, she'll be back, all right?
She wouldn't steal my truck.

01:16:52.682 --> 01:16:53.808
Okay.

01:16:57.896 --> 01:17:00.147
That's the last bottle of Pepsi.

01:17:00.232 --> 01:17:04.068
Maybe I'll just call Domino's
and have them deliver some Pepsi.

01:17:06.404 --> 01:17:09.657
Still, if she didn't steal your truck

01:17:09.741 --> 01:17:12.743
and she didn't get into an accident,
what do you reckon...

01:17:12.828 --> 01:17:16.205
Shut up about Cindy, already,
before I kick your fat ass!

01:17:18.583 --> 01:17:20.626
WOMAN: Domino's.
Hello, Mr. Wilkinson.

01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:21.710
Hello.

01:17:26.091 --> 01:17:27.091
- BRIAN: Hey.
- Hey, Brian.

01:17:27.175 --> 01:17:28.509
Step's here to see you.

01:17:29.886 --> 01:17:32.555
Is he? Great. Bring him in.

01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:34.890
He's outside at the loading dock.

01:17:34.975 --> 01:17:39.562
He wants to talk to you alone out there
for some reason. You know?

01:17:39.646 --> 01:17:40.980
Man to man.

01:17:44.651 --> 01:17:48.112
I'm sick and tired of dealing
with that Adler fellow.

01:17:48.864 --> 01:17:53.284
Truth is, I just want my old life back.
I just wanna get back to work.

01:17:54.411 --> 01:17:57.705
You know? I'm a working man.
That's what I do.

01:17:58.206 --> 01:18:01.709
The problem is,
if I bankrupt the company,

01:18:02.627 --> 01:18:04.962
there won't be a job for me
to go back to.

01:18:05.839 --> 01:18:07.965
You don't have to bankrupt
the company.

01:18:08.633 --> 01:18:11.719
Well, if I drop the lawsuit,
you'll sell the company,

01:18:11.803 --> 01:18:16.390
and the new company, well, who'd
want to hire somebody with one ball?

01:18:16.808 --> 01:18:22.313
Well, you know, listen, I don't think
they're actually allowed to ask,

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:23.939
so you're okay.

01:18:26.276 --> 01:18:28.402
You know, I'm a working man, too,
Step. You know?

01:18:28.486 --> 01:18:32.781
I make extract. That's what I do.
You know? Vanilla.

01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:37.661
Cherry. Root beer. S'mores.

01:18:38.455 --> 01:18:40.915
And a lot of people don't think that
that's very cool,

01:18:40.999 --> 01:18:44.168
but I think that it is pretty cool, so,

01:18:45.837 --> 01:18:48.005
why would I want to sell this place?

01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:53.010
I think that I just got distracted
with Dean and the drugs

01:18:53.094 --> 01:18:55.888
and the gigolos and...

01:18:59.351 --> 01:19:02.519
You know, what I'm saying is
that I'm thinking about maybe

01:19:02.604 --> 01:19:04.355
not selling the company.

01:19:05.190 --> 01:19:07.608
That is, if there isn't a lawsuit.

01:19:08.443 --> 01:19:10.527
There is going to be
that insurance money, Step,

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:12.279
so what do you think?

01:19:13.198 --> 01:19:14.865
Yeah, that sounds fair to me.

01:19:17.077 --> 01:19:18.661
But under one condition.

01:19:19.913 --> 01:19:21.205
What's that?

01:19:21.706 --> 01:19:23.707
You make me floor manager.

01:19:29.506 --> 01:19:30.506
(WHISTLES)

01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:32.007
Hold the line!

01:19:32.092 --> 01:19:33.133
(BELL RINGING)

01:19:33.218 --> 01:19:34.551
Thank you.

01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:36.887
Okay.

01:19:38.181 --> 01:19:40.683
Everybody gather around! Listen up!

01:19:45.230 --> 01:19:50.985
Okay. First of all, I want to say that
I've decided not to sell the company.

01:19:51.945 --> 01:19:53.237
All right?

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:58.158
And, secondly, I'm making Step here
the new floor manager.

01:19:58.827 --> 01:20:01.912
Anybody doesn't like that,
I hear they're hiring over at GemCo.

01:20:02.747 --> 01:20:05.457
Remember, though, at GemCo,
the owner doesn't know your names.

01:20:05.542 --> 01:20:06.834
You'll probably never even meet him.

01:20:06.918 --> 01:20:09.712
He's, like,
in some corporate office somewhere.

01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:11.755
Here, you know, I'm just upstairs.

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:14.717
You can come up there and you can
tell me if you got a problem, okay?

01:20:14.801 --> 01:20:16.301
That's all. Okay?

01:20:17.012 --> 01:20:18.512
Step, the floor is yours.

01:20:20.098 --> 01:20:21.098
(MARY SCOFFS)

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:22.516
You're not selling?

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.600
(BELL RINGING)

01:20:23.685 --> 01:20:24.977
I'm not selling.

01:20:25.395 --> 01:20:27.521
You better start learning
their names, Brian.

01:20:29.107 --> 01:20:30.149
(GROANS)

01:20:30.233 --> 01:20:31.984
- You just go off to work and do...
- Yeah.

01:20:32.068 --> 01:20:36.238
Hey! You two get back to work!
Quit your yapping.

01:20:43.955 --> 01:20:45.789
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:20:58.386 --> 01:20:59.636
Hey, man.

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:04.308
Look, I know you probably
want to kick my ass.

01:21:04.392 --> 01:21:08.604
I just wanted to tell you that
I'm not gonna see Suzie anymore,

01:21:08.688 --> 01:21:10.314
so you don't have to worry.

01:21:10.815 --> 01:21:12.483
She's really into you, dude.

01:21:12.984 --> 01:21:16.236
I guess that's why
she married you and shit.

01:21:16.821 --> 01:21:17.946
Whatever.

01:21:18.490 --> 01:21:21.992
You're a really lucky guy,
and I'm sorry if I messed shit up.

01:21:22.410 --> 01:21:23.786
Why'd you have to get hung up
on Suzie?

01:21:23.870 --> 01:21:25.412
You could have any girl you want.

01:21:25.497 --> 01:21:29.374
Yeah, but I want Suzie.
I can't have her.

01:21:29.501 --> 01:21:31.293
You had her 15 times.

01:21:32.337 --> 01:21:33.670
Well, yeah.

01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:38.592
But she doesn't love me, dude.
It's just not the same.

01:21:39.177 --> 01:21:42.304
- Anyway, I just wanted to tell you that.
- All right. You told me.

01:21:43.723 --> 01:21:45.474
All right. Later.

01:21:53.525 --> 01:21:58.487
Hey, so, I was wondering,
I quit my landscaping job,

01:21:58.571 --> 01:22:02.407
and I don't really think I'm cut out
for the whole gigolo thing.

01:22:02.492 --> 01:22:07.746
You know? So, do you think
you might have, like, an opening

01:22:07.831 --> 01:22:10.791
or whatever at the extract plant?

01:22:10.875 --> 01:22:12.876
I'm not going to give you a job. Okay?

01:22:14.295 --> 01:22:15.462
Yeah. Sorry.

01:22:21.928 --> 01:22:25.639
Or just come by the office
and fill out an application.

01:22:25.723 --> 01:22:27.391
I'll see what I can do, okay?

01:22:28.226 --> 01:22:29.977
Cool. Thanks, man.

01:22:32.981 --> 01:22:34.481
There he goes.

01:22:35.108 --> 01:22:37.568
Johnny Horse-cock. Rolling.

01:22:39.404 --> 01:22:41.989
You know, I'm starting to think
this might have been a mistake.

01:22:42.073 --> 01:22:44.700
- Really?
- Maybe it was my fault, you know?

01:22:44.784 --> 01:22:46.535
- Maybe it was your fault.
- No, it's yours.

01:22:46.619 --> 01:22:48.704
A lot of blame to go around here.

01:22:48.788 --> 01:22:53.125
I think there are some people
who just aren't meant to do drugs, Joel.

01:22:54.252 --> 01:22:56.378
I think you're one of those people, man.

01:23:03.303 --> 01:23:04.469
Hello?

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:06.305
Shit.

01:23:08.641 --> 01:23:11.101
Why are you cleaning
the pool yourself?

01:23:11.186 --> 01:23:12.895
New guy didn't work out?

01:23:12.979 --> 01:23:14.771
Yeah, no, didn't work out.

01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.442
Boy, it's just hard
to get good help, huh?

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:19.651
Yeah.

01:23:20.361 --> 01:23:21.778
(CHUCKLES)

01:23:22.572 --> 01:23:25.616
Hey. Did you get a chance
to write that check?

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:30.370
Nathan, Joel and I are not going
to that dinner. Okay?

01:23:31.414 --> 01:23:34.333
Gee, I wish you would have told me that
before I went and bought those tickets.

01:23:34.417 --> 01:23:36.960
Joel never agreed to it,
and neither did I.

01:23:38.463 --> 01:23:41.256
Well, it sure sounded like
you guys were coming.

01:23:41.341 --> 01:23:43.383
I mean, Leslie was going
to talk to you about it,

01:23:43.468 --> 01:23:45.302
but you don't return our calls.

01:23:45.929 --> 01:23:49.223
I mean, I already bought those tickets,
and they're non-refundable.

01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:53.060
I really wish you guys had been
a little more clear with me.

01:23:55.146 --> 01:23:57.439
Well, then,
let me be clear with you now.

01:23:58.274 --> 01:24:01.944
When we say things like,
"I don't think so,"

01:24:02.028 --> 01:24:03.737
or "I'm not sure,"

01:24:03.821 --> 01:24:08.408
or we close the door in your face,
that means, "No."

01:24:08.493 --> 01:24:09.993
Why can't you get that?

01:24:10.536 --> 01:24:12.579
- Well, it...
- Shut up! Okay.

01:24:12.664 --> 01:24:16.208
Let me be even more clear
with you, Nathan.

01:24:16.292 --> 01:24:18.335
We don't like you.

01:24:18.795 --> 01:24:20.837
Is that clear enough for you?

01:24:20.922 --> 01:24:24.633
You're dull. You talk too much.
You never listen.

01:24:24.717 --> 01:24:26.260
You're always in our yard.

01:24:26.344 --> 01:24:28.762
I don't know what the hell
you're barbecuing over there,

01:24:28.846 --> 01:24:30.389
but it stinks.

01:24:30.473 --> 01:24:34.226
You lay out in your front yard
and listen to your car radio!

01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:37.604
You are the worst neighbor
in the world.

01:24:37.689 --> 01:24:41.358
We don't like you. Is that clear enough
for you, Nathan? Is that clear?

01:24:41.442 --> 01:24:42.734
Shut up!

01:24:43.027 --> 01:24:44.278
Nathan?

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.698
Nathan? Nathan?

01:24:48.658 --> 01:24:50.534
(CHURCH ORGAN PLAYING)

01:25:14.559 --> 01:25:16.101
(CHATTERING)

01:25:20.064 --> 01:25:21.398
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:25:23.901 --> 01:25:25.235
Are you okay?

01:25:27.739 --> 01:25:30.157
I think I might have killed him, Joel.

01:25:30.241 --> 01:25:33.327
The last thing he heard was me
yelling at him to shut up.

01:25:33.411 --> 01:25:36.204
Well, he did talk a lot.

01:25:36.289 --> 01:25:40.334
Yeah. He was going on and on.
I finally lost it.

01:25:40.418 --> 01:25:43.462
I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
Probably just a coincidence, you know.

01:25:43.546 --> 01:25:46.256
I don't know. I just...
I still feel really guilty about it.

01:25:46.549 --> 01:25:50.927
I actually told Leslie I would go
to that Rotary Club dinner tonight.

01:25:51.929 --> 01:25:54.306
She said Nathan
would have wanted it that way.

01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:56.099
I said I'd go to that, too.

01:25:56.809 --> 01:25:57.893
Oh.

01:26:02.273 --> 01:26:05.817
So, who was this woman that you
wanted to have the affair with, anyway?

01:26:05.902 --> 01:26:09.696
She was just some criminal drifter.

01:26:12.658 --> 01:26:13.700
It wasn't that great.

01:26:13.785 --> 01:26:17.079
You know, I thought that she was
really into food flavoring and...

01:26:17.163 --> 01:26:18.705
- Really?
- Yeah, I should have known better.

01:26:18.790 --> 01:26:20.457
Nobody's into food flavoring.

01:26:21.334 --> 01:26:23.752
Well, I don't know.
I mean, you guys sell a lot of that stuff.

01:26:23.836 --> 01:26:25.379
People are into it.

01:26:31.761 --> 01:26:33.553
You should know, by the way,

01:26:34.639 --> 01:26:36.139
I hired Brad.

01:26:37.141 --> 01:26:39.893
Yeah, I know. You told me that,
remember? The whole...

01:26:39.977 --> 01:26:43.563
No, sorry,
not for the sex thing or the pool.

01:26:43.898 --> 01:26:46.149
I mean that I hired him for the factory.

01:26:46.818 --> 01:26:49.152
Why? He's a total moron.

01:26:49.237 --> 01:26:51.905
Yeah, I know.
This is going to sound kind of weird,

01:26:51.989 --> 01:26:54.699
but I felt sorry for him.

01:26:55.618 --> 01:26:57.494
Yeah. So did I.

01:27:00.832 --> 01:27:03.291
Well, my car's over here, so,

01:27:04.168 --> 01:27:07.170
I guess I'll see you at the Rotary Club?

01:27:09.090 --> 01:27:10.632
Yeah, I'll see you there.

01:27:15.012 --> 01:27:16.263
Suzie?

01:27:17.598 --> 01:27:19.599
Should we maybe just take one car?

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:22.644
Yeah. We probably should.

01:27:23.438 --> 01:27:24.604
Yeah.

01:27:26.899 --> 01:27:30.026
I thought that was
a surprisingly tasteful funeral.

01:27:30.111 --> 01:27:34.197
JOEL: Yes, it was. You know, when
I was looking down on him, I thought,

01:27:34.699 --> 01:27:37.993
"This might be the longest
I've ever seen him with his mouth shut."

01:27:38.077 --> 01:27:40.537
SUZIE: Yeah. I didn't expect
that many mourners.

01:27:40.997 --> 01:27:42.706
There were a lot of people there.

01:27:42.790 --> 01:27:43.832
JOEL: Yeah.

01:27:46.794 --> 01:27:51.006
(SINGING) You have been
a friend of mine, rainy day woman

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:55.594
That woman of mine, she ain't happy

01:27:56.012 --> 01:27:59.306
Till she finds something wrong
and someone to blame

01:27:59.390 --> 01:28:01.057
If it ain't one thing,
it's another one on the way

01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:02.726
(PHONE RINGING)

01:28:04.270 --> 01:28:05.562
ON ANSWERING MACHINE:
Hey. You've reached Cindy.

01:28:05.646 --> 01:28:07.147
I'm not here, so leave a message.

01:28:10.693 --> 01:28:12.110
Where the hell is she?

01:28:14.739 --> 01:28:17.949
How long does it take to get some
goddamned cigarettes around here?

01:28:23.206 --> 01:28:24.706
VALET: Here you are, sir.

01:28:27.293 --> 01:28:28.752
JOE: What the fuck?

01:29:22.515 --> 01:29:24.849
Oh, rainy day woman

01:29:25.643 --> 01:29:29.896
I've never seem to see you for
the good times or the sunshine

01:29:31.440 --> 01:29:35.652
You have been a friend of mine,
rainy day woman

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:37.195
Woman
