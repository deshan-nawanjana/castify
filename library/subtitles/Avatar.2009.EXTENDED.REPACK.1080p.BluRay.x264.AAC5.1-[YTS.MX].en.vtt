00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.948
May the All Mother...

2
00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:07.548
...smile upon our first meeting.

3
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.858
Not bad. You sound a little formal.

4
00:15:11.525 --> 00:15:13.923
I studied for five years...

5
00:15:13.931 --> 00:15:15.989
...but there is much to learn.

6
00:48:35.675 --> 00:48:38.589
Calm people, calm.

7
00:48:44.275 --> 00:48:47.110
What are you doing, Tsu'tey?

8
00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.623
These demons are forbidden here.

9
00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.598
There has been a sign.

10
00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.841
This is a matter for the Tsahik.

11
00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:03.899
Bring him.

12
00:50:26.650 --> 00:50:27.649
Father...

13
00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:30.299
...I see you.

14
00:50:42.450 --> 00:50:43.449
This creature...

15
00:50:44.250 --> 00:50:46.361
...why do you bring him here?

16
00:50:48.775 --> 00:50:50.348
I was going to kill him...

17
00:50:50.350 --> 00:50:52.189
...but there was a sign from Eywa.

18
00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:57.661
I have said no dreamwalker
will come here.

19
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:01.093
His alien smell fills my nose.

20
00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:15.560
Step back!

21
00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.646
I will look at this alien.

22
00:52:18.100 --> 00:52:19.348
A warrior!

23
00:52:19.350 --> 00:52:20.848
I could kill him easily!

24
00:52:20.850 --> 00:52:21.849
No!

25
00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:28.698
This is the first warrior
dreamwalker we have seen.

26
00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:31.605
We need to learn more about him.

27
00:52:33.946 --> 00:52:35.019
My Daughter...

28
00:52:35.825 --> 00:52:40.298
...you will teach him our way...

29
00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:43.898
...to speak and walk as we do.

30
00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:46.554
- Why me? That's not fair...
- Enough.

31
01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.088
This alien will learn nothing...

32
01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:28.649
...a rock sees more...

33
01:00:30.050 --> 01:00:31.049
...look at him.

34
01:10:01.025 --> 01:10:03.681
Look how big you are.

35
01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.392
You are so pretty.

36
01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:29.303
I see you, Brother

37
01:15:30.100 --> 01:15:31.953
...and thank you.

38
01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.265
Your spirit goes with Eywa.

39
01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:40.798
Your body stays behind...

40
01:15:40.800 --> 01:15:43.554
...to become part of The People.

41
01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.666
That moron's going to die.

42
01:21:19.700 --> 01:21:21.683
Don't be afraid, warrior.

43
01:33:25.025 --> 01:33:29.386
You are now a son of the Omaticaya.

44
01:33:30.775 --> 01:33:33.881
You are part of The People.

45
01:41:20.700 --> 01:41:22.550
Tsu'tey will lead the war party.

46
01:41:29.650 --> 01:41:30.825
Stop please!

47
01:41:32.150 --> 01:41:34.312
This will only make it worse.

48
01:41:37.150 --> 01:41:39.466
We will strike them in the heart.

49
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:58.037
I have something to say...

50
01:43:01.025 --> 01:43:02.508
...to all of you.

51
01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:39.398
You see?

52
01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:41.399
It is a demon in a false body.

53
01:50:05.600 --> 01:50:06.748
Father!

54
01:50:06.750 --> 01:50:07.848
Mother!

55
01:50:07.850 --> 01:50:11.198
Eytukan, I have something to say.

56
01:50:11.200 --> 01:50:12.199
Listen!

57
01:50:13.500 --> 01:50:15.040
Speak, Jakesully.

58
01:50:16.225 --> 01:50:18.803
A great evil is upon us...

59
01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:24.166
The Sky People are coming
to destroy Hometree.

60
01:51:39.525 --> 01:51:40.615
Bind them.

61
01:51:42.250 --> 01:51:43.437
Leave now!

62
01:52:40.175 --> 01:52:43.535
Have no fear.

63
01:53:05.430 --> 01:53:07.994
Take the ikran, attack from above.

64
01:54:42.475 --> 01:54:44.073
Get everyone to the forest.

65
01:59:30.750 --> 01:59:31.921
Father!

66
01:59:47.900 --> 01:59:49.255
Daughter...

67
01:59:50.100 --> 01:59:55.040
take... my... bow.

68
01:59:56.850 --> 02:00:02.196
Protect The People.

69
02:11:45.675 --> 02:11:48.015
Tsu'tey, son of Ateyo...

70
02:11:49.100 --> 02:11:51.210
...I stand before you...

71
02:11:52.125 --> 02:11:55.506
...ready to serve the Omaticaya people.

72
02:13:50.750 --> 02:13:54.423
Hear us please, All Mother.

73
02:13:54.425 --> 02:13:56.579
Eywa, help her.

74
02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.142
Take this spirit into you...

75
02:14:02.950 --> 02:14:06.383
...and breathe her back to us.

76
02:14:08.650 --> 02:14:10.624
Let her walk among us...

77
02:14:13.475 --> 02:14:16.140
...as one of The People.
