Housekeeping!

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.694
Arm yourselves, gentlemen.

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.848
Okay, this is the last time I'm gonna
say it, and then I'll drop it.

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:04.142
But what about my
jeans club idea?

00:02:04.166 --> 00:02:06.168
Right? Twenty dollars a month

00:02:06.627 --> 00:02:09.188
for access to over
10,000 pairs of jeans?

00:02:09.212 --> 00:02:10.315
Who wouldn't buy that?

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.942
Well, almost everybody we
asked about it. Right?

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:14.426
What about my hot-tutor idea?

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.156
Kids would study harder if their
tutor was really hot, right?

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.908
We just needed to build up our...
our stable of tutoresses.

00:02:20.932 --> 00:02:23.745
Yeah, well, maybe when you called
them a "stable of tutoresses"

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:26.456
on the Craigslisting...
that was a bad idea.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.082
We could come up
with other names.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.418
The whole point is that
it's a weird concept

00:02:30.442 --> 00:02:33.695
to hire women to take off
their clothes for children.

00:02:34.988 --> 00:02:37.884
Why am I coming up with the ideas, right?
I'm not the idea guy.

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:40.178
Darren, that's you.
You're the idea guy.

00:02:40.202 --> 00:02:41.846
I'm the "why."
You're the "what."

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.264
Baby Dunc, you're the "how."

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:46.059
So let's put it into high
gear right now, baby.

00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:47.977
Why? Because our lives suck.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:51.105
I did my part. What are we
gonna do about it, Darren?

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.774
And how are we gonna
do it, Baby Dunc?

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:54.442
Let's go! Let's freakin'...

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:58.029
put it into high gear.

00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:00.782
Yeah, let's kick it into high gear.
Sell me some salvia.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:02.700
- I'm about to get high.
- Darren.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:05.119
Darren, you're a drug addict.
And I'm here to help.

00:03:05.143 --> 00:03:07.997
- I got you. There you go.
- Thank you, baby.

00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.332
Enjoy that.

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.042
- Ooh.
- What the hell are you doing, man?

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:12.960
I'm a hustler. "I'm a...
I'm a hustler."

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:15.630
I'm basically the Rick Ross
of our friendship tripod.

00:03:15.654 --> 00:03:16.881
What's the big deal?

00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:18.716
Weed does not do
the trick anymore.

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.635
- This stuff does.
- Really great.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.720
I'm not gonna become the
mom from Moonlight.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:25.098
Yeah, no. I know what
that movie's about.

00:03:25.122 --> 00:03:26.957
I steered clear of that one.

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:29.936
I'm more of a La La Land guy.

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.020
La-la boy.

00:03:34.131 --> 00:03:36.007
Bye-bye.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.945
Latro.

00:03:41.138 --> 00:03:42.990
- Gonna start tweakin'.
- Yeah.

00:03:43.014 --> 00:03:45.576
He's gonna start tweakin'!

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.830
Oh, my God. Look at the
size of this dude's load!

00:03:48.854 --> 00:03:50.164
- What?
- Look at this thing!

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.208
Don't touch it.

00:03:52.232 --> 00:03:53.918
That's a heavy hitter.

00:03:53.942 --> 00:03:55.128
Whoa. Yeah, no.

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:57.004
It's like Nickelodeon Gak.

00:03:59.072 --> 00:04:01.426
- The consistency's thick, like flubber.
- Mm.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.761
Rub some on our shoes, see
if we can play basketball.

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:06.931
I mean, his nut sack
must be gigantoid.

00:04:06.955 --> 00:04:08.808
- Yeah.
- Right? Just big old sack

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:10.768
- to produce that.
- I don't really wanna imagine

00:04:10.792 --> 00:04:12.145
any nut sacks,

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:15.231
but I will say the only thing that
would make me blow a load that big

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:18.401
is a really hot babe, right?
I am right?

00:04:18.425 --> 00:04:21.446
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.448
I mean, look. They're
everywhere, man.

00:04:23.472 --> 00:04:25.241
There's one. There's one.

00:04:25.265 --> 00:04:27.034
This guy's busting loads
all over this room.

00:04:27.058 --> 00:04:28.369
That's what we should be doing.

00:04:28.393 --> 00:04:30.329
We should be busting
loads into condoms

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:32.415
or maybe even not into
condoms if she's tested.

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:37.295
He's chuggin' champagne
like a freakin' boss!

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:40.381
I'm over here... I'm holding on to
the poop side of this scrubber.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:42.258
Sure, yes. I've heard
all of this before.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:46.429
We should be wearing diamonds, collecting
albino pythons, dating on Raya.

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:47.847
Raya?

00:04:47.871 --> 00:04:49.265
We're not, okay? We're here.

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.249
This is our life.

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:54.979
That's still fizzy. It's pretty good.
You might want some.

00:04:55.003 --> 00:04:56.898
- What was that?
- Oh, he's tweaking.

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:59.901
Here, here. Grab a condom. Put it
on his face. I'll take a picture.

00:04:59.925 --> 00:05:02.779
Oh, you are a dog.

00:05:02.803 --> 00:05:06.449
- That's what he gets.
- Oh, my God.

00:05:06.473 --> 00:05:08.409
Ooh, we got the snakeskin.

00:05:08.433 --> 00:05:10.620
- Don't do drugs.
- No!

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.288
- Okay.
- No!

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.415
- Put it on his face.
- Take the photo.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.292
- Take the picture. Take a photo.
- No.

00:05:16.316 --> 00:05:18.252
I will as soon as you
put it on his face.

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:20.963
- I'm not going to. Just take the photo.
- Just put it on his face.

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.966
- He'll get an STD.
- All the ejac is inside of the condom.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.551
Take the photo.

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:26.761
Grab it!

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:28.095
The outside, the woman...

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:29.972
She could have one, obviously.

00:05:29.996 --> 00:05:31.790
- Well, she...
- Hey!

00:05:34.543 --> 00:05:35.520
What's wrong with him?

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:36.562
- Yep. Darren!
- No!

00:05:36.586 --> 00:05:38.189
- All right, just stop.
- Darren.

00:05:38.213 --> 00:05:39.941
Okay. Joel, I got this. Come on.

00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:41.984
You want some salvia? Huh?

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:43.861
Get the fuck out of my room.

00:05:43.885 --> 00:05:45.238
Get out, maids.

00:05:45.262 --> 00:05:47.156
We're not maids.
We're housekeepers.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.826
- Not even that hot.
- Yeah, dude, you're not even that hot.

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.537
I was talking about
the chick, Baby Dunc.

00:05:52.561 --> 00:05:54.288
Yeah, so was I.

00:05:54.312 --> 00:05:56.707
It's 2018. You can
call chicks dudes now.

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.084
- Okay.
- You can.

00:05:58.108 --> 00:06:00.044
What the heck are
you guys doing?

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:03.113
Hey, dude. See?

00:06:05.574 --> 00:06:07.701
Is he high again?

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:10.012
No.

00:06:10.036 --> 00:06:12.932
I don't think he's being truthful.
I have to call Mitch.

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:14.082
Wish you wouldn't.

00:06:14.457 --> 00:06:16.185
- Don't do that!
- Hi, Mitch.

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:18.128
- It's Cassie.
- Don't do that to your boy.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:20.856
- Jesus Christ.
- What?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.358
Pick him up. Put
him on the cart.

00:06:22.382 --> 00:06:25.236
Come on, Darren.
Come on, come on.

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.737
Jesus.

So they were yelling at hotel
guests and smoking dope.

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:39.166
- Is that right?
- Yes.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.210
Yelling at guests,
screaming obscenities.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:44.237
Well, Tums... boys will be boys.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.425
You still want that associate
manager promotion, don't you?

00:06:47.449 --> 00:06:50.386
Well, honey, tonight is
your chance to prove it.

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:51.971
All right?

00:06:51.995 --> 00:06:54.181
Hope you got your balls on, now.

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:57.518
No, I have...

00:06:57.542 --> 00:07:01.063
Uh, yes, I have giant, uh, lady...
lady parts

00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.714
that hang like balls.

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.443
They're also called ovaries.
Those are inside.

00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:08.946
Good, 'cause we have got a shit storm
of a party heading our way tonight.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.531
Boys, I'm gonna need
you working too.

00:07:10.555 --> 00:07:12.283
Toni... what? Are you serious?

00:07:12.307 --> 00:07:15.286
Corky! This is Mr. Ahmad.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:18.998
He is the personal attaché
of the Bey of Tunisia.

00:07:19.022 --> 00:07:21.542
Oh, like the butler
from Fresh Prince?

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:22.501
Very neat.

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:25.463
- I'm far from a butler.
- Wonder what happened to that guy.

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:27.506
Oh, that dude's paid.
He's doing fine.

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.216
Bey Awadi. The rich
dude from Instagram?

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.593
This is who we speak of.

00:07:30.617 --> 00:07:32.094
Aw, I love that dude.

00:07:32.118 --> 00:07:34.180
He takes all the pictures
with the hot models

00:07:34.204 --> 00:07:35.723
and the guns and
the hovercrafts,

00:07:35.747 --> 00:07:37.892
and the hot models shooting
guns on hovercrafts.

00:07:37.916 --> 00:07:40.394
Yeah, didn't he poop
off the Eiffel Tower?

00:07:40.418 --> 00:07:41.562
- Mm-mm, no.
- Yeah.

00:07:41.586 --> 00:07:45.024
He paid a man $10,000 to
poop off the Eiffel Tower.

00:07:45.048 --> 00:07:46.901
That's what's up.

00:07:46.925 --> 00:07:48.945
He pays dudes tons of
money all the time

00:07:48.969 --> 00:07:50.887
- to do, like, stupid shit.
- Wow.

00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:52.323
- Dudes.
- What?

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:53.807
We should pitch him the...

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.079
We should... pitch in tonight.

00:07:58.103 --> 00:08:00.289
At the party. And
be a team player.

00:08:00.313 --> 00:08:04.126
Also, I should mention, uh, no cameras.
That includes cell phones.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:08.130
- Privacy... a great concern of the Bey.
- All right, copy that. Give them up, boys.

00:08:08.154 --> 00:08:09.489
- What, now?
- Yeah.

00:08:09.864 --> 00:08:13.761
Hashtag "right now." What is it with
you kids and the phones? Come on.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.829
You'll get 'em back at
the end of the night.

00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:19.082
Okay. Now...

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:22.293
you guys have some place to be?
I bet you do, huh?

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:24.838
So fucking get there!

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.234
Oh, hey!

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:30.528
Sack up now, Tums.
Big night, right?

00:08:30.552 --> 00:08:31.594
Yes!

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:34.615
I can't get in there.

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:37.493
I call her Tums 'cause she
relieves my heartburn.

00:08:37.517 --> 00:08:39.453
Always been a nickname guy,

00:08:39.477 --> 00:08:42.814
even when I was
back QB-ing at USC.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:44.834
Our security team should
be arriving soon.

00:08:44.858 --> 00:08:45.876
Great.

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:47.795
Hey, wanna go for one?

00:08:47.819 --> 00:08:48.879
- No.
- Blue.

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.298
- Forty-two! Hut, hut, hut, huh?
- What are we doing?

00:08:51.322 --> 00:08:52.591
- Wanna go?
- I don't know what...

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:54.093
All right. Fuck it.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.095
Oh!

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.763
Right in the numbers!

00:08:57.787 --> 00:08:58.764
I still got it.

00:08:58.788 --> 00:09:00.540
I'll race you down there.
Come on!

00:09:08.214 --> 00:09:09.966
<i>Don't be stingy, papi.</i>

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:16.097
- Kisses.
<i>- You like that?</i>

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:18.141
<i>It's for you.</i>

00:09:20.518 --> 00:09:23.521
- Uh, I have to go.
<i>- Okay, bye. Bye, sexy.</i>

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.905
Hey. I'm Ray.

00:09:32.864 --> 00:09:36.034
Mitch usually has me run security
for these special events.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.204
Uh, but you look like you
know what you're doing.

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.808
I'm just here for
the payday, right?

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:43.917
That makes two of us.

00:09:44.584 --> 00:09:45.585
Aah!

00:09:59.766 --> 00:10:02.119
Donald, get linked up with
our offshore bank accounts

00:10:02.143 --> 00:10:03.370
as soon as possible.

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:04.789
Well, you didn't bring me along

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.583
'cause I look like the black
nerd from Die Hard...

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:08.667
'cause I don't.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:11.069
Roger, I'm sick of it.

00:10:11.694 --> 00:10:13.798
We need to secure the
building and arm the exits

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:17.242
with our explosive triggers before
we can take control of the rooftop.

00:10:17.951 --> 00:10:21.454
So until then, consider
yourselves "hotel security."

00:10:22.163 --> 00:10:25.351
And once the Bey gives us
his account access codes

00:10:25.375 --> 00:10:27.293
and Donald transfers
the money...

00:10:27.919 --> 00:10:29.254
we pull out.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.817
Gentlemen... let's move.

00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:36.136
Oh, and... someone
get rid of the body.

00:10:39.848 --> 00:10:41.992
You should grab his ankles.
You're good at that.

00:10:42.016 --> 00:10:45.603
- Fuck off, fag.
- Ooh.

00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:56.340
You'd seriously wanna
pitch the Bey of Tunisia

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:57.675
one of our million-dollar ideas?

00:10:57.699 --> 00:10:59.718
- Yeah.
- If we're pitching an idea...

00:10:59.742 --> 00:11:02.179
- We're pitching!
- What are we pitching?

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:05.432
We could go with my
jeans club idea.

00:11:05.456 --> 00:11:06.392
Hot tutors.

00:11:06.416 --> 00:11:09.478
Medieval Times: breakfast,
lunch, and tournament?

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.815
I don't ever wanna hear about
Medieval Times BLT ever again.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.441
Okay, they only do dinner.

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:17.027
We would do breakfast and lunch.
That's two more meals!

00:11:17.051 --> 00:11:20.114
We would totally knock 'em out
of the medieval dining space.

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.323
Oh, that's a huge market.

00:11:21.347 --> 00:11:24.493
Okay, you guys have good ideas? I wanna
hear 'em. I'm excited to hear 'em.

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:26.537
I feel like I'm the only one

00:11:26.561 --> 00:11:28.229
crushing ideas out the gate.

00:11:29.522 --> 00:11:31.458
Skintendo Joysuit?

00:11:31.482 --> 00:11:34.044
Uh, what? No. Baby Dunc...

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:36.338
Yeah, we're going Skintendo.
I like it.

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.032
All right, you know what?
I hate to be this guy,

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:41.594
but that dude's not gonna
invest in Skintendo.

00:11:41.618 --> 00:11:43.202
Not in a million Willenniums.

00:11:43.703 --> 00:11:46.539
So, it's like that?

00:11:47.457 --> 00:11:50.561
We finally have a shot

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:53.981
to fulfill our childhood dreams

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:57.216
and you guys wanna let
it float on past?

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:00.970
It's... like... dat?

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:05.910
I don't know about you,

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:07.995
but I don't wanna be picking
up nut-stuffed condoms

00:12:08.019 --> 00:12:11.081
for the rest of my life without knowing
what type of sex they had with it.

00:12:11.105 --> 00:12:13.083
Was it missionary? Was it doggy?

00:12:13.107 --> 00:12:15.669
Was it doggy butt? Was it side-style butt?
I don't know.

00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:20.633
Yeah, Alexxx, we all wanna know how
people are fucking each other, okay?

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:22.134
- Obviously.
- It's obvious.

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:24.595
- Mostly all I think about.
- Yeah, I mean, I can keep going.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.639
- Cowgirl, reverse cowgirl.
- Plow-girl.

00:12:26.663 --> 00:12:28.557
- Where you take the legs and you...
- Yeah.

00:12:28.581 --> 00:12:30.601
I'm just saying, we
don't have the Joysuit.

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:33.103
Right? There's no screen
to play Lumber Jackson.

00:12:33.127 --> 00:12:34.230
- Right.
- Okay.

00:12:34.254 --> 00:12:37.066
You ready? Okay, you're the QB.
You're the running back.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:38.609
Giving you the ball.
Run with it.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:41.445
You need to write down all
the technical mumbo jumbo

00:12:41.469 --> 00:12:43.530
so the Bey understands
what this thing is.

00:12:43.554 --> 00:12:45.032
- Right?
- That's a lot of work.

00:12:45.056 --> 00:12:47.284
Darren, I'm gonna get you
markers, a poster board.

00:12:47.308 --> 00:12:49.119
You're gonna draw Lumber Jackson

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:52.122
so beautifully...
muscles just popping.

00:12:52.146 --> 00:12:54.708
Shredded, baby!

00:12:54.732 --> 00:12:57.962
And you're gonna draw the Skintendo.
Right? The whole Joysuit.

00:12:57.986 --> 00:13:00.756
Make it look pretty, and then I'm
gonna pitch that motherfucker.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:03.884
- Okay.
- Dollar-dollar bills, y'all.

00:13:03.908 --> 00:13:06.387
Boom! Put it in.

00:13:06.411 --> 00:13:07.972
Dew'd Crew in full effect!

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:12.351
Finally fulfilling our destiny
of being childhood billionaires.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:13.560
Let's do it! Hands in.

00:13:13.584 --> 00:13:15.771
Everybody put your hands in.
Hands in.

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:17.940
Put your fist in.
Put your fist in.

00:13:17.964 --> 00:13:19.775
Dew'd Crew!

00:13:19.799 --> 00:13:21.777
- I fucking love you guys. I'm so excited.
- Okay.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:24.071
- Yes! I'll go get supplies.
- All right.

00:13:24.095 --> 00:13:27.116
Yeah, just, uh, go get
those markers, man. Sick.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.409
What the fuck was that?

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:29.702
What?

00:13:29.726 --> 00:13:31.620
I mean, c-come on. He's
gonna pitch something.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:32.997
It might as well be Skintendo.

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.498
Listen, dum-dum.

00:13:34.522 --> 00:13:36.458
We can't pitch any
of the upgrades.

00:13:36.482 --> 00:13:40.028
We can't pitch the wireless connectivity,
the friend-controller mode.

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.132
Because if we do,
Alexxx is gonna know

00:13:43.156 --> 00:13:45.426
that we've been working
on Skintendo without him.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.160
I'm just sick of working
here, all right?

00:13:47.285 --> 00:13:49.054
We should've told him
from the beginning.

00:13:49.078 --> 00:13:50.097
No, no. What?

00:13:50.121 --> 00:13:52.224
He would've turned it into
some moneymaking idea,

00:13:52.248 --> 00:13:54.268
and that's not what it is to us.
Right?

00:13:54.292 --> 00:13:56.353
- Right.
- And we're not gonna tell him now,

00:13:56.377 --> 00:13:58.188
'cause he'll probably just...

00:13:58.212 --> 00:14:00.274
kill himself. Or someone.
I don't know.

00:14:00.298 --> 00:14:03.760
I can just see him going into a rage and...
biting people. Children.

00:14:04.552 --> 00:14:06.238
Bitten children.
Blood on your hands.

00:14:06.262 --> 00:14:07.698
Fine.

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.534
So we pitch Bey,
he laughs us off,

00:14:10.558 --> 00:14:14.788
and we go back to working on the idea...
together, secretly.

00:14:17.398 --> 00:14:18.524
The fuck is that?

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:21.128
- It's a vape pen, Baby Dunc.
- Okay.

00:14:21.152 --> 00:14:23.422
Well, you look like a
tool smoking that thing.

00:14:23.446 --> 00:14:25.841
Well, I'm not "smoking" it.

00:14:25.865 --> 00:14:27.176
I'm vaping it.

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:34.457
Ah, these your boys?

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:37.770
I believe so. Mr. Drothers.

00:14:37.794 --> 00:14:41.523
- Mr. Ahmad. We, uh, spoke over the phone.
- Please. Conrad.

00:14:41.547 --> 00:14:45.611
- This is Donald. This is Erma.
- You brought your girlfriend, huh?

00:14:45.635 --> 00:14:47.053
I'm not his girlfriend.

00:14:48.221 --> 00:14:49.221
Noted.

00:14:50.306 --> 00:14:52.368
So did you guys, uh,
meet up with Ray?

00:14:52.392 --> 00:14:54.286
Ray isn't going to make it.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:57.480
But I assure you, he briefed me.
Thoroughly.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:01.818
Okay, Conrad.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.154
If Ray briefed you
so thoroughly...

00:15:05.905 --> 00:15:08.926
he left out the most important
detail of the evening.

00:15:16.249 --> 00:15:17.291
No hats.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.897
No hats. I guess the Bey likes to
be the only guy wearing a hat.

00:15:21.921 --> 00:15:24.525
Which I get, you know,
'cause I'm a hat guy myself.

00:15:24.549 --> 00:15:27.593
But, uh... really, love
the Kangol, but...

00:15:28.052 --> 00:15:29.655
Maybe call you Kangol-roo.

00:15:29.679 --> 00:15:30.739
Uh...

00:15:30.763 --> 00:15:33.117
Kangol-roo, huh? How about that?

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.827
Come on. Let's go
have a party, huh?

00:15:34.851 --> 00:15:35.977
Let's have some fun.

00:15:36.561 --> 00:15:38.980
I'm gonna dance with
you tonight, my dear.

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:45.421
<i>♪ Have a word for your brother ♪</i>

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:48.715

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.351
Whoo!

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.895
Catch me, dudes!

00:16:01.919 --> 00:16:04.398
<i>- ♪ Really love one another... ♪</i>

00:16:04.422 --> 00:16:07.609
Yeah, so I met Bey... Uh,
he was doing a TED Talk

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.195
in Vegas... on being 'bout it.

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.948
We had a moment, and now
we're good friends.

00:16:12.972 --> 00:16:17.035
Well, we're not good friends, actually.
I w... I would say... acquaintances.

00:16:17.059 --> 00:16:19.329
You know what? I'm hoping
to meet him tonight.

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:21.331
Keep your eyes peeled. The
Bey's somewhere here.

00:16:21.355 --> 00:16:23.792
Whoa! Oh! Action Bronson
right over here.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:27.111
Excuse me, Mr. Bronson. Can I
interest you in a pulled pork...

00:16:27.612 --> 00:16:28.988
barbecue quesadilla...

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.115
with corn relish.

00:16:35.495 --> 00:16:37.538
Fuck, that's fuckin'
delicious, man.

00:16:38.164 --> 00:16:39.457
I'm glad you enjoyed it.

00:16:40.333 --> 00:16:42.394
- He spit it out but said it was delicious.
- Yes.

00:16:42.418 --> 00:16:45.481
Maybe he's watching his calorie intake.
He is wearing athletic wear.

00:16:45.505 --> 00:16:47.006
Ho-ly shit.

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:48.840
There he is...

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:50.467
the Bey.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:54.096
Oh, my God, he is the man.

00:16:54.597 --> 00:16:57.493
Even his little dog has
100,000 followers.

00:16:57.517 --> 00:16:59.077
- Wow.
- Yeah, I don't know,

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.746
it looks like he's having fun.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.915
We should probably just
let him do his thang.

00:17:02.939 --> 00:17:05.834
Maybe we, uh, hang in the cut?
You know, have him come to us?

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.586
"The cut"? There's no cut.

00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:09.421
Action's in the cut.

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.381
We're not gonna be in the cut if...
Whatever.

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:12.758
Let's go. It's game time.

00:17:12.782 --> 00:17:15.385
Hey, yo, I had this pet
hyena once, right?

00:17:15.409 --> 00:17:16.803
Then that motherfucker died.
Ehh!

00:17:16.827 --> 00:17:18.680
More appeteezees for the Bey.

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:21.725
Then I had that motherfucker
stuffed, put a Fleshlight in back,

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.769
and then I fucked the
shit out that bitch.

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:26.772
It's like necrophilia
and bestiality in one.

00:17:26.796 --> 00:17:28.565
It's hilarious!

00:17:28.589 --> 00:17:30.943
That is hilarious.

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.778
Pulled pork quesadilla...

00:17:32.802 --> 00:17:35.822
- with a corn relish, anyone?
- Yo.

00:17:35.846 --> 00:17:38.325
That sounds bomb as
fyuck right now.

00:17:38.349 --> 00:17:39.743
Throw one into my open mouth.

00:17:39.767 --> 00:17:40.827
- Really?
- Yeah, bro.

00:17:40.851 --> 00:17:42.436
- Okay.
- Ah...

00:17:43.854 --> 00:17:46.208
- Oh, I nailed it!
- Make it rain!

00:17:46.232 --> 00:17:47.400
- Makin' it rain!
- Come on!

00:17:48.943 --> 00:17:51.964
Oh, that shit was dope. I'm
covered in grease, baby.

00:17:51.988 --> 00:17:53.924
- Yo, you're my dude.
- Thank you so much.

00:17:53.948 --> 00:17:55.842
And this shit is on punto.

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.427
Hey, um...

00:17:57.451 --> 00:17:58.971
Bey-Bey, may I ask
you a question?

00:17:58.995 --> 00:18:01.372
- What that, bro?
- Do you like black people?

00:18:04.208 --> 00:18:06.019
Because Lumber
Jackson is the first

00:18:06.043 --> 00:18:09.064
full-body-controlled
blaxploitation video game ever.

00:18:09.088 --> 00:18:12.025
Now, using our revolutionary
Skintendo Joysuit technology...

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:14.403
Excuse me. Step
away immediately.

00:18:14.427 --> 00:18:16.363
Yo, Ahmad, chill
the fuck out, bro.

00:18:16.387 --> 00:18:18.156
I'm trying to listen to the man.

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:19.700
- Thank you.
- I'm chilled out.

00:18:19.724 --> 00:18:21.994
I arranged this
chilled-out party.

00:18:22.018 --> 00:18:23.537
I got Shaggy to perform.

00:18:23.561 --> 00:18:24.538
Uh, Shaggy?

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:27.332
Man, busted-ass Shaggy ain't
performing shit, a'ight?

00:18:27.356 --> 00:18:29.376
And put that dusty-ass
BlackBerry away.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:31.837
This primitive-ass,
prehistoric motherfucker.

00:18:31.861 --> 00:18:34.798
I'm sorry, guys, 2018, this
dude ain't got a touch screen?

00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:35.966
You big fucking tree.

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.718
Goddamn.

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:39.219
What a bitch-ass.

00:18:39.243 --> 00:18:41.430
- He's just a butler.
- Yeah, you suck.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:43.390
Yeah, you got low self-esteem.
Fuck off, bro.

00:18:43.414 --> 00:18:45.684
Anyway, you were
saying, my dude?

00:18:45.708 --> 00:18:47.978
That suit controls that
video game character?

00:18:48.002 --> 00:18:49.313
- Yes, actually.
- Oh, yeah.

00:18:49.337 --> 00:18:51.857
- And here...
- Yeah, this is the schematics right here.

00:18:51.881 --> 00:18:53.483
You know, I built
it, programmed it.

00:18:53.507 --> 00:18:55.152
Oh, my God.

00:18:55.176 --> 00:18:57.779
Bro, please approach us and
just unzip your trousers

00:18:57.803 --> 00:18:59.906
and pull that dick out
so we could just see

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:02.909
what the penis head of a
genius really looks like.

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.661
- Know what I'm saying?
- Pull your dick out.

00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.205
Well, to be honest, uh, it would
be my penis head pulled out.

00:19:07.229 --> 00:19:09.708
I'm the genius that came up with
the whole concept, the idea.

00:19:09.732 --> 00:19:11.043
I'm not gonna pull my dick out.

00:19:11.067 --> 00:19:12.753
Oh, okay. That's a
cute little cartoon,

00:19:12.777 --> 00:19:14.254
but did you build
the motherfucker?

00:19:14.278 --> 00:19:16.673
- Yeah, no, we have.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, we built it.

00:19:16.697 --> 00:19:18.592
And there's actually
some new features too,

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.010
like, uh, friend-control mode,

00:19:20.034 --> 00:19:23.430
where, uh, you can actually control the
person wearing the Skintendo Joysuit.

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:25.557
It's... it's revolutionary.

00:19:25.581 --> 00:19:28.352
Damn. Oh, yo, yo, I'm gonna
need, like, three of those

00:19:28.376 --> 00:19:30.562
for, like, blap, blap, blap.
You know what I'm saying?

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:33.065
'Cause I love fucking white women.
Makes me feel powerful,

00:19:33.089 --> 00:19:35.249
especially if I can control
them, you know what I mean?

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:39.863
Yes! I forgot about friend-control mode.
But you know who didn't forget about it?

00:19:39.887 --> 00:19:43.158
Sony and Microsoft when we
pitched them this idea.

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:45.911
And they were super into it. But
you know what I said to them?

00:19:45.935 --> 00:19:47.371
Fuck y'all!

00:19:47.395 --> 00:19:49.831
'Cause the Dew'd Crew wants
to do business with the Bey.

00:19:49.855 --> 00:19:52.042
The Dew'd Crew? Wait, wait, wait.
Time-out, time-out.

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:53.710
'Cause y'all drink
mad Mountain Dew?

00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:54.878
You got it!

00:19:54.902 --> 00:19:56.254
Yes, that's exactly right.

00:19:56.278 --> 00:19:57.381
- How did you...
- Wow.

00:19:57.405 --> 00:20:01.468
Yo, motherfucker, me too!
Holy shit, dude!

00:20:01.492 --> 00:20:04.578
- You ever fuck with Baja Blast?
- Oh, you know I do. You know I do!

00:20:04.704 --> 00:20:05.764
- So good.
- Ah, man...

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:07.683
- Code Red over here!
- This is Code Red boy.

00:20:07.707 --> 00:20:08.874
Fuck, I love you guys!

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.603
Let's talk numbers. How much
money we talking about?

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:13.730
Bey Awadi. Sorry, this...
this feels like

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:16.608
just the sort of frivolous investment
we spoke about not partaking in.

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:21.113
My dude, just because you told me not to,
why don't you "par-take" my checkbook out

00:20:21.137 --> 00:20:24.366
and then write these
motherfuckers a check

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.577
for
200-frivolous-fucking-thousand-dollars

00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:30.914
so they can chase their goddamn dreams?
Am I right? Yezzir.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.833
Oh, and then please scrub
out my hyena's pussy,

00:20:32.857 --> 00:20:34.710
'cause I'm trying to
fuck that shit later.

00:20:34.734 --> 00:20:36.253
You should fuck it.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.713
Treat yo'self. Oh, my God!

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.089
Cool. Get the fuck out of here.

00:20:39.113 --> 00:20:41.216
- Oh, my God. Yeah. Okay.
- Go. Get out, get out.

00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.884
We'll talk more numbers later.

00:20:42.908 --> 00:20:44.219
- Thank you.
- Bye, take care.

00:20:44.243 --> 00:20:47.180
All right, y'all. I'm
spending paper tonight.

00:20:47.204 --> 00:20:48.497
It's just the beginning!

00:20:49.081 --> 00:20:50.249
Not happening.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.979
Apologies, Corky. Let's go, boys.
Let's go.

00:20:54.003 --> 00:20:55.522
Let's go!

00:20:55.546 --> 00:20:58.883
Cassie! Cassie! Tums!

00:20:59.425 --> 00:21:00.861
Tums, meet me at the elevator.

00:21:00.885 --> 00:21:02.446
- Come on, boys.
- But our check.

00:21:09.852 --> 00:21:11.771
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, I was just...

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:14.875
Yeah, we're going.

00:21:14.899 --> 00:21:18.319
- Get up. Get out of here.
- Ow. Goddamn.

00:21:21.697 --> 00:21:26.011
These three idiots just tried to sell
a goddamn video game to the Bey!

00:21:26.035 --> 00:21:27.596
I thought I told you to sack up!

00:21:27.620 --> 00:21:29.931
I'm sorry. I didn't...

00:21:29.955 --> 00:21:32.601
You didn't... You didn't
want that promotion?

00:21:32.625 --> 00:21:34.335
Yeah, you made
that pretty clear.

00:21:35.294 --> 00:21:37.272
Boys! You're fired.

00:21:37.296 --> 00:21:39.524
- Yeah.
- No fucking way, Mitch.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:40.525
He was assaulted.

00:21:40.549 --> 00:21:42.426
Out! Out you go!

00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:45.221
- We're going.
- Cassie...

00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:49.475
- get back to work.
- Yes, sir.

00:21:53.896 --> 00:21:56.666
That's quite a stiff arm
you got there, huh?

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.402
You all right? Huh? That paw
of yours need a little ice?

00:22:01.821 --> 00:22:04.716
- My hand is fine.
- Ah.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:07.260
Well, how about a little ice
for those nipples, huh?

00:22:11.247 --> 00:22:13.683
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

00:22:13.707 --> 00:22:15.084
Yeah, you like that, huh?

00:22:15.709 --> 00:22:16.752
Oh, that's hot.

00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:19.439
Oh, that is hot, lady.

00:22:19.463 --> 00:22:20.857
You wanna play?

00:22:20.881 --> 00:22:22.651
- I do.
- Okay.

00:22:22.675 --> 00:22:25.529
- Oh, I knew it. Oh.
- What about this?

00:22:25.553 --> 00:22:27.614
- Yeah. Ooh.
- Mm.

00:22:27.638 --> 00:22:29.682
Speaking of stiff...

00:22:33.811 --> 00:22:36.122
Not my pecker!

00:22:38.107 --> 00:22:40.210
Whoopsie-daisy.

00:22:40.234 --> 00:22:42.587
All I'm saying is,

00:22:42.611 --> 00:22:44.923
you win some, you lose some.

00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:48.552
The key to our jiggy fuckin' lifestyle
is tucked in that butler's pocket.

00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:51.078
My name is Alexxx with three Xs.

00:22:53.289 --> 00:22:55.874
I'm about to go explosive
on these motherfuckers!

00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:58.645
Three X means
"poison," by the way.

00:22:58.669 --> 00:23:01.856
- Uh, it's also a Vin Diesel movie.
- Shut the fuck up.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.858
Yeah, well, it's also
spicy barbecue sauce.

00:23:03.882 --> 00:23:06.570
But I think we all know I meant
it in the explicit fashion!

00:23:09.888 --> 00:23:12.600
My darling, have you
lost your fucking mind?

00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:16.288
Get him out of here. If they see
him before we secure the build...

00:23:24.445 --> 00:23:25.755
<i>Lock down all exits.</i>

00:23:25.779 --> 00:23:28.883
<i>We have three waiters on
the run and they know.</i>

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:30.951
<i>Donald, it's time.</i>

00:23:31.493 --> 00:23:32.536
Copy that.

00:23:34.496 --> 00:23:38.393
Hey, fellas. Bey Awadi's security here.
We just have one question.

00:23:38.417 --> 00:23:39.561
What's your question?

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:42.171
- Do you wanna die?
- What?

00:23:44.423 --> 00:23:46.401
Whoa, hey, hey.

00:24:03.359 --> 00:24:04.878
What, y'all don't pack a lunch?

00:24:04.902 --> 00:24:07.088
Man, take these clowns up
to the roof with the rest.

00:24:07.112 --> 00:24:08.632
- Okay.
- Let's go.

00:24:08.656 --> 00:24:09.549
Easy, man.

00:24:09.573 --> 00:24:11.176
Locking down perimeter now.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.328
<i>Attention, all units. Operation
Trespass begins now.</i>

00:24:14.453 --> 00:24:16.246
Sweep the hotel.

00:24:16.664 --> 00:24:19.434
Lock and arm all exits
with breach sensors.

00:24:19.458 --> 00:24:21.061
We are taking over.

00:24:21.085 --> 00:24:23.271
- Move! Get down, stay down.
- Hey, everybody be calm!

00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:25.649
Just do what they say.
Everything's gonna be okay.

00:24:25.673 --> 00:24:27.359
Right? Right?

00:24:27.383 --> 00:24:30.153
Oh!

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:33.406
Oh! Oh, shit! Oh, fuck!

00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:35.391
Shit. Fuck.

00:24:36.350 --> 00:24:39.019
Yo, what the fuck, man? You're
supposed to be guarding the party.

00:24:39.561 --> 00:24:40.646
Party's over.

00:24:50.739 --> 00:24:52.717
Darren, stop vaping, all right?

00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:55.387
- I can't breathe!
- Just shut up! Okay?

00:24:55.411 --> 00:24:57.347
As these doors open,
they're gonna be waiting,

00:24:57.371 --> 00:24:59.248
ready to cut cocks.

00:25:00.290 --> 00:25:01.601
We'll hide. Hide in the shaft.

00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:03.603
- Here, just help me up. Help me up.
- What?

00:25:03.627 --> 00:25:06.648
- Ow. Just... what are you doing?
- Oh... oh!

00:25:06.672 --> 00:25:08.191
- I found the latch.
- Oh, seriously?

00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:09.895
- I think I found it.
- Well, go... get in.

00:25:13.846 --> 00:25:15.055
Shit.

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:17.534
They climbed into
the elevator shaft.

00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:20.310
They could be anywhere.
Keep your eyes open.

00:25:28.610 --> 00:25:30.422
Gotta just get the thing...

00:25:30.446 --> 00:25:33.633
- You said you found a latch.
- No, I said I think I found a latch.

00:25:33.657 --> 00:25:35.260
Shut up, Baby Dunc.

00:25:35.284 --> 00:25:36.284
Whoa.

00:25:36.702 --> 00:25:37.703
No one's there.

00:25:38.746 --> 00:25:39.872
Follow me.

00:25:41.039 --> 00:25:42.892
Wait, I think we should
turn ourselves in.

00:25:42.916 --> 00:25:43.977
What? No. Go!

00:25:44.001 --> 00:25:45.812
Not turning ourselves in.
That's pussy shit.

00:25:45.836 --> 00:25:47.230
They might appreciate
the gesture.

00:25:47.254 --> 00:25:50.191
Yeah, and they might cut our dicks off.
We gotta get out and go for help.

00:25:50.215 --> 00:25:52.569
We're not gonna go for help.
Slide down this rail.

00:25:52.593 --> 00:25:53.987
- It'll be badass.
- What?

00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:55.363
Yeah.

00:25:57.431 --> 00:25:58.992
Oh! Oh, shit.

00:25:59.016 --> 00:26:02.102
- I need help.
- That was not badass. Come on!

00:26:07.858 --> 00:26:09.753
All exits confirmed as locked.

00:26:09.777 --> 00:26:11.528
No sign of the waiters.

00:26:15.324 --> 00:26:17.385
They locked the doors and
we don't have our phones!

00:26:17.409 --> 00:26:19.369
- We're screwed!
- No shit, Baby Dunc.

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.496
We gotta get a landline.

00:26:28.337 --> 00:26:29.505
Clear.

00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:35.052
- I got two.
- Quick, take 'em up with the rest.

00:26:35.469 --> 00:26:36.863
<i>- Ándale, bitch.</i>

00:26:42.434 --> 00:26:43.685
Let's move.

00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:50.126
<i>Tie them together.</i>

00:26:50.150 --> 00:26:52.879
One collar per group.

00:26:52.903 --> 00:26:55.799
Now, listen up... if
you want to live.

00:26:55.823 --> 00:26:57.967
These collars are
linked to sensors

00:26:57.991 --> 00:27:02.639
that we have placed at every
entrance of this building.

00:27:02.663 --> 00:27:06.917
Anyone who attempts
to enter or exit,

00:27:07.501 --> 00:27:08.978
they detonate.

00:27:09.002 --> 00:27:11.147
It's fucked up, right?

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:13.441
- You missed me.
- Collect their cell phones

00:27:13.465 --> 00:27:15.360
if they still have them.

00:27:15.384 --> 00:27:18.112
And if they try
anything funny, well...

00:27:19.972 --> 00:27:23.117
refrain from killing
anyone unless I tell you.

00:27:23.141 --> 00:27:24.410
We're not here to murder.

00:27:24.434 --> 00:27:26.454
We're here to collect
a toll from Bey Awadi

00:27:26.478 --> 00:27:29.040
for trespassing
on American soil.

00:27:29.064 --> 00:27:31.334
You ain't touching
my stacks, bro.

00:27:31.358 --> 00:27:32.836
Really?

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.879
"In case of threat of
violence or act of terror,

00:27:34.903 --> 00:27:37.298
please do not challenge
or defy assailants.

00:27:37.322 --> 00:27:39.134
Comply with their
demands at all times."

00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:41.219
Did you read that in the
manual or something?

00:27:41.243 --> 00:27:42.637
No.

00:27:42.661 --> 00:27:44.347
Well, yes, but... who cares?

00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:46.683
It gives me everything I need
to keep the hotel in order,

00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:49.060
- no matter what.
- This lady just shit her pants.

00:27:49.084 --> 00:27:50.728
Is that in the manual too?

00:27:50.752 --> 00:27:54.148
I... I did... I did
not shit my pants.

00:27:54.172 --> 00:27:56.359
I just want to make that clear.

00:27:56.383 --> 00:27:58.027
Are you calling me a liar?

00:27:58.051 --> 00:28:00.864
No, I'm saying you're very smart and
you're picking up on something.

00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:03.825
Maybe someone... someone
did shit their pants.

00:28:03.849 --> 00:28:05.434
And I'm not gonna say who.

00:28:06.727 --> 00:28:08.913
- But someone.
- Get her out of here.

00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:12.166
- Yeah, get her out of here. Damn it.
- Get you out of here.

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:14.669
Oh, it's dripping.

00:28:14.693 --> 00:28:15.962
And now it hit my anklet.

00:28:15.986 --> 00:28:17.922
And my toe ring.

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.384
We are locked down, boss.

00:28:21.408 --> 00:28:24.596
And I'm very close to accessing
the offshore accounts.

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.763
<i>I know, I know.</i>

00:28:25.787 --> 00:28:28.040
"Close only counts in
horseshoes and hand grenades."

00:28:28.832 --> 00:28:30.083
I wasn't gonna say that.

00:28:30.459 --> 00:28:31.769
The phones are dead.

00:28:31.793 --> 00:28:34.188
No Internet either.
No Wi-Fi, no DSL.

00:28:34.212 --> 00:28:37.442
Jesus, this guy has so many tabs open.
It's stressing me the fuck out.

00:28:37.466 --> 00:28:39.611
Guys, they cut the lines.

00:28:39.635 --> 00:28:40.928
It's what they do.

00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:44.223
It's... what I'd do.

00:28:45.224 --> 00:28:47.142
Hey, stop talking cool. Okay?

00:28:50.687 --> 00:28:51.687
Clear.

00:28:56.777 --> 00:28:58.922
Oh, my God. There's two
guys out there with guns.

00:28:58.946 --> 00:29:00.965
- They're coming this way.
- That's it. I'm done.

00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:03.343
Wait, what are you...
What's with the pockets?

00:29:03.367 --> 00:29:05.553
- I'm showing them I'm unarmed.
- Shut up.

00:29:05.577 --> 00:29:07.597
We can think of something.
We can take 'em.

00:29:07.621 --> 00:29:09.098
Darren, just think of something.

00:29:09.122 --> 00:29:11.041
I can't. I got nothing, man.

00:29:11.959 --> 00:29:14.086
- I...
- Fine.

00:29:15.379 --> 00:29:17.297
- What are you...
- I got an idea.

00:29:18.507 --> 00:29:20.467
I haven't done this
in a long time.

00:29:31.979 --> 00:29:35.232
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

00:29:43.115 --> 00:29:44.300
Whoa!

00:29:44.324 --> 00:29:45.867
What the fuck?

00:29:47.786 --> 00:29:49.180
Look at this freaky fuck.

00:29:49.204 --> 00:29:51.665
Hey, Rich, come in here.
You gotta see this.

00:29:54.835 --> 00:29:55.812
Jesus.

00:29:55.836 --> 00:29:57.879
Rest in peace, you
horny bastard.

00:30:00.382 --> 00:30:01.985
What's your problem?

00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:04.028
I just don't like the
way this job is going.

00:30:04.052 --> 00:30:06.805
- Everything's falling apart.
- Ah. Hey, hey, hey.

00:30:07.556 --> 00:30:10.201
By this time tomorrow,
we'll be sitting poolside

00:30:10.225 --> 00:30:12.019
sipping Coronas in Cabo, right?

00:30:14.062 --> 00:30:16.148
I just don't wanna see
you getting hurt.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.108
You're sweet.

00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.152
I love you.

00:30:23.363 --> 00:30:24.906
I love you too.

00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.099
- Yeah.
- Real quick.

00:30:33.123 --> 00:30:34.416
Okay, yeah.

00:30:52.184 --> 00:30:53.894
Ew, right?

00:30:57.314 --> 00:30:59.232
- Stop!
- Sorry. Hey.

00:30:59.858 --> 00:31:01.419
Hmm?

00:31:01.443 --> 00:31:05.173
You go around, grab the
corner of the sheet...

00:31:17.667 --> 00:31:18.667
Psst!

00:31:29.054 --> 00:31:30.823
Hit 'em with the lamp!

00:31:30.847 --> 00:31:32.116
Wha...

00:31:39.189 --> 00:31:40.708
Oh, I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.

00:31:41.983 --> 00:31:43.920
Are you all right?

00:31:46.196 --> 00:31:47.322
Rich? Rich?

00:31:50.534 --> 00:31:52.595
- Ow.
- Uh...

00:31:52.619 --> 00:31:55.848
Oh! Freeze! Shit.

00:31:55.872 --> 00:31:58.101
You just killed the
man of my dreams.

00:31:58.125 --> 00:31:59.727
- Now you're gonna die.
- No, no.

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:03.171
He's just knocked out. Like the movie
<i>Friday. "He got knocked the fuck out!"</i>

00:32:10.429 --> 00:32:13.616
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I killed him.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.640
I'll be your boyfriend.

00:32:23.900 --> 00:32:25.068
I didn't do it.

00:32:32.576 --> 00:32:34.470
Baby Dunc, are you okay?

00:32:36.413 --> 00:32:37.723
I think you killed him.

00:32:40.083 --> 00:32:41.602
Sorry I didn't help,

00:32:41.626 --> 00:32:44.713
but I got punched in the
chest really hard one time.

00:32:46.756 --> 00:32:50.153
We killed the bad guys.
My plan worked!

00:32:50.177 --> 00:32:51.362
What... hey, stop it!

00:32:51.386 --> 00:32:53.114
Your plan didn't work.
You got them horny

00:32:53.138 --> 00:32:54.699
and got me 300
kicked in the chest.

00:32:54.723 --> 00:32:56.284
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine!

00:32:56.308 --> 00:32:58.619
We got these bitches right
where we want them.

00:32:58.643 --> 00:33:01.247
- Now we gotta just go through their shit.
- Alexxx, no! No!

00:33:01.271 --> 00:33:03.458
Leave their stuff alone.
You're gonna make them madder.

00:33:03.482 --> 00:33:06.002
Baby Dunc, what are you talking about?
This is video games 101.

00:33:06.026 --> 00:33:09.046
- You kill bad guys, you take their shit.
- It's true.

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:10.506
Like you never
played video games.

00:33:10.530 --> 00:33:12.240
- Go close the fucking door.
- Okay, yeah.

00:33:13.450 --> 00:33:14.450
We got zip ties.

00:33:16.620 --> 00:33:19.765
We got a fucking gun.
We got a big-ass knife.

00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:22.643
By the way, I get next kill. You
guys are being total kill hogs...

00:33:25.754 --> 00:33:29.150
- What did you do?
- Okay, and that is where the trigger is.

00:33:29.174 --> 00:33:30.860
- Oh, my God.
- Now we know that.

00:33:30.884 --> 00:33:32.469
I'm gonna go put on pants, so...

00:33:33.053 --> 00:33:34.697
Oh, yeah, no. Good
call, good call,

00:33:34.721 --> 00:33:37.909
you're gonna wanna be fully clothed when
you fucking blow your head off, man!

00:33:37.933 --> 00:33:39.911
Why are you getting
dressed in the closet?

00:33:39.935 --> 00:33:41.895
We've already seen your
dick, balls, and butthole.

00:33:42.812 --> 00:33:45.166
- You guys saw my butthole?
- A lot.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:47.835
- I haven't shaved in months.
- Okay, this is it.

00:33:47.859 --> 00:33:51.088
I'm stressing out. Alexxx, get back
here and sell me salvia right now, man!

00:33:51.112 --> 00:33:53.841
Yeah, Darren, I'm not gonna
sell you salvia right now

00:33:53.865 --> 00:33:57.178
'cause we're kind of under
attack from terrorists.

00:33:57.202 --> 00:33:59.972
Every time you open that, I see your dick.
We need to get outta here.

00:33:59.996 --> 00:34:04.060
We need to get away from bad people.
We need to get help from good people.

00:34:04.084 --> 00:34:07.396
If you wanna bail on the Bey and the
Skintendo Joysuit to go get help,

00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:09.106
fine, we can do that.

00:34:09.130 --> 00:34:10.983
But we gotta do it
in a badass fashion,

00:34:11.007 --> 00:34:13.236
or we're gonna look like
total fucking pussies.

00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:14.612
We are pussies!

00:34:14.636 --> 00:34:17.240
- We don't have to look like it, Baby Dunc!
- Don't call me that.

00:34:17.264 --> 00:34:19.784
Darren, think of something
dope and badass to get us out.

00:34:19.808 --> 00:34:22.286
- What?
- Baby Dunc, implement the thing

00:34:22.310 --> 00:34:24.563
that Darren's about to think of.
Go.

00:34:26.273 --> 00:34:27.941
I'm not coming up
with the plan, okay?

00:34:37.492 --> 00:34:40.471
- Shit! I thought of something.
- What?

00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:41.788
Is it something I can build?

00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.684
- Yeah.
- Fuck.

00:34:44.708 --> 00:34:46.835
Why do I have to be so
goddamn industrious?

00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:50.481
Hey, guys? If you guys
thought my dick was small,

00:34:50.505 --> 00:34:52.525
it's 'cause the AC was
really blasting earlier.

00:34:52.549 --> 00:34:53.592
So that's the reason.

00:34:54.509 --> 00:34:57.071
- It's super hot, right?
- It's very hot.

00:34:57.095 --> 00:34:58.096
Alexxx, I...

00:34:59.055 --> 00:35:00.682
you've got nothing
to be ashamed of.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.941
If you... don't pull too much on this
one, 'cause then this one gets pulled.

00:35:12.569 --> 00:35:14.130
What the fuck, man?

00:35:14.154 --> 00:35:16.591
Eagle Eye has been
watching you, Bey Awadi.

00:35:16.615 --> 00:35:20.011
The... the U.S. militia faction?
What do they want with him?

00:35:20.035 --> 00:35:22.263
Sometimes the government's
politically correct hands

00:35:22.287 --> 00:35:24.557
get tied in knots, forcing
people to protect their lands

00:35:24.581 --> 00:35:26.350
from unwanted invasions.

00:35:26.374 --> 00:35:27.917
"Invasions."

00:35:28.251 --> 00:35:29.812
I'm not a fuckin' invader, bro.

00:35:29.836 --> 00:35:32.523
I love America. I went
to Florida State.

00:35:32.547 --> 00:35:33.691
Peep the bill, bro.

00:35:33.715 --> 00:35:35.776
I'm here to have fun, fuck,

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.695
drink, pop Molly.

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.322
What's more American
than that, bro?

00:35:39.346 --> 00:35:40.573
Money.

00:35:40.597 --> 00:35:43.451
Five hundred million dollars
transferred into an offshore account.

00:35:43.475 --> 00:35:46.954
Five hundred million? You are crazy, Mr.
Albino Bad Guy.

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:48.331
That's not gonna happen.

00:35:48.355 --> 00:35:50.249
He doesn't have that
kind of cash flow.

00:35:50.273 --> 00:35:52.692
I-it's all tied up in
assets, uh, bonds...

00:35:53.193 --> 00:35:56.922
Does this free up
some of those assets?

00:35:56.946 --> 00:35:58.466
I get it.

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:01.510
This is a prank. It's just
kind of dark, man, like...

00:36:01.534 --> 00:36:03.370
Knoxville, you can come out now!

00:36:03.745 --> 00:36:06.265
No! Steve-O! Steve, you okay?

00:36:06.289 --> 00:36:09.125
- Come on, man. We told you we can't.
- Th-th-there is a way.

00:36:10.043 --> 00:36:11.812
Oh, dear.

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:14.899
An account a-access code. Only,
uh, he and his father have it.

00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:16.567
What the fuck are you doing?

00:36:16.591 --> 00:36:18.611
He's playing nice.

00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:20.863
Now it's your turn.

00:36:20.887 --> 00:36:23.783
I can't, okay? If... if
I give you those codes,

00:36:23.807 --> 00:36:26.202
- my dad'll kill me, a'ight?
- What's its name?

00:36:26.226 --> 00:36:28.704
Wh... what?

00:36:28.728 --> 00:36:29.705
The dog.

00:36:29.729 --> 00:36:31.374
The dog?

00:36:31.398 --> 00:36:33.209
- Mm.
- Lil Puma.

00:36:33.233 --> 00:36:34.794
Little Puma. Hi, pal.

00:36:34.818 --> 00:36:37.505
Oh, that's a good boy.

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:38.964
Come to Uncle Conrad.

00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:40.925
We have a couple of those
extra breach sensors.

00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:42.659
Get them with a
corresponding collar.

00:36:43.326 --> 00:36:45.429
Be careful with his hip
dysplasia, please.

00:36:45.453 --> 00:36:48.641
Of course, of course. You know,
I love dogs. Big dogs, usually.

00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:50.476
Little dogs not
much, but this one

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.353
has a great personality.

00:36:52.377 --> 00:36:54.254
No, no, no. What...
what are you doing?

00:36:56.715 --> 00:36:58.758
There you go, Lil Puma.
Go get it, boy.

00:37:00.301 --> 00:37:02.822
- Oh, thank you very much.
- Don't do it.

00:37:02.846 --> 00:37:03.906
Puma, stay. Stay, Puma.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:06.575
No!

00:37:10.979 --> 00:37:12.230
Why is this thing beeping?

00:37:12.814 --> 00:37:15.668
Oh, shit!

00:37:21.531 --> 00:37:24.909
I must have given you the nine...
which was upside down.

00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.245
That is my bad.

00:37:27.704 --> 00:37:30.057
The lesson still stands.

00:37:30.081 --> 00:37:33.793
The account numbers, or there
will be more bloodshed.

00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.213
Do it, Bey Awadi.

00:37:40.258 --> 00:37:41.861
Okay. Okay, clear. Go.

00:37:41.885 --> 00:37:43.195
- Ready?
- Yeah.

00:37:48.808 --> 00:37:51.704
Zip-tie zip line. Baby
Dunc, you genius.

00:37:51.728 --> 00:37:54.498
Uh, it was my idea. You know,
I saw the scaffolding.

00:37:54.522 --> 00:37:56.041
I said, "Home
Alone-style zip line."

00:37:56.065 --> 00:37:58.169
- Okay, it's fine. Good work.
- Thanks.

00:37:58.193 --> 00:38:02.548
Okay. Are you ready to be Tom Brady?
Because that's what's about to go down.

00:38:02.572 --> 00:38:05.301
You're gonna become
Tom Brady, Alexxx.

00:38:05.325 --> 00:38:06.552
- Fuckin' Tom Brady, dog.
- Yes.

00:38:06.576 --> 00:38:08.262
- Yeah, you're Tom Brady.
- Tom Brady, dog!

00:38:08.286 --> 00:38:10.663
Yeah, you're Tom Brady.

00:38:10.789 --> 00:38:13.642
Shh.

00:38:13.666 --> 00:38:16.312
Here we go.

00:38:22.967 --> 00:38:25.154
I'm Tom Brady!

00:38:25.178 --> 00:38:26.947
- Tom Brady!
<i>- ♪ We the Brady Bunch ♪</i>

00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:29.974
<i>- ♪ We the Brady Bunch ♪ - The what?
What? Brady Bunch?</i>

00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:32.560
Do you think Tom Brady
is in The Brady Bunch?

00:38:33.561 --> 00:38:35.247
Yeah, it's the dad, right?

00:38:35.271 --> 00:38:36.707
- No.
- No, he isn't.

00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:38.250
Oh, I thought that's who we...

00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:41.629
He was cool, though. He was really cool.
He had a hell of a... arm.

00:38:41.653 --> 00:38:44.173
Okay, why don't you just show
us how my zip line works, Joel?

00:38:44.197 --> 00:38:46.383
- Yeah.
- Right, right. Um...

00:38:46.407 --> 00:38:50.638
Okay, so basically, I rigged
up this ironing board,

00:38:50.662 --> 00:38:52.223
- like a harness.
- Right.

00:38:52.247 --> 00:38:54.850
And then you kind of use it
like a hang glider. Okay...

00:38:54.874 --> 00:38:56.060
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:38:56.084 --> 00:38:57.686
Kevin McCallister
would be proud.

00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:58.979
Maybe even Tom Brady.

00:38:59.003 --> 00:39:00.564
- Don't talk about Tom Brady.
- Who's he?

00:39:00.588 --> 00:39:02.566
- Just don't talk about him.
- All right.

00:39:02.590 --> 00:39:03.651
Quarterback.

00:39:03.675 --> 00:39:05.361
Here's what we're gonna do.

00:39:05.385 --> 00:39:08.656
We are gonna shoot rock, paper,
scissors to find out who goes first.

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.116
Okay, but no "two out
of three" bullshit.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.684
- Whoever wins wins.
- Right.

00:39:12.809 --> 00:39:14.537
- Fair and square, right? Okay.
- Yes, yeah.

00:39:14.561 --> 00:39:16.413
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

00:39:16.437 --> 00:39:18.082
- Yes.
- Fuck!

00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:20.042
- Thank God.
- Fuck!

00:39:20.066 --> 00:39:22.169
Let's go again. Two out of three.
Let's be fair.

00:39:22.193 --> 00:39:24.171
- What? You just said...
- No, do not do this, okay?

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:26.465
It could've happened to any
of us, just happened to you.

00:39:26.489 --> 00:39:29.760
Yeah, maybe, or maybe hella
long ago, you guys were like,

00:39:29.784 --> 00:39:33.597
"If we ever do rock, paper, scissors
with Alexxx, we should shoot paper."

00:39:34.998 --> 00:39:37.685
Because two guys shooting
paper, that's suspect.

00:39:37.709 --> 00:39:39.103
- I can't...
- Yeah.

00:39:39.127 --> 00:39:41.021
Okay, just forget it.
Let's shoot again.

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:43.274
- What? No.
- Yes, thank you, Baby Dunc.

00:39:43.298 --> 00:39:45.734
- How about, don't be a sore loser?
- Don't call me a loser.

00:39:45.758 --> 00:39:47.319
Hey, guys, stop fighting.

00:39:47.343 --> 00:39:48.988
We'll make a dummy
and do a test run.

00:39:49.012 --> 00:39:52.408
- We have a dummy right here.
- No, we'll just use one of the dead bo...

00:40:05.945 --> 00:40:08.197
Oh, my God!

00:40:17.874 --> 00:40:20.019
Oh, God!

00:40:25.298 --> 00:40:26.525
A little help.

00:40:26.549 --> 00:40:27.550
Help!

00:40:28.843 --> 00:40:30.178
Oh, fuck.

00:40:37.226 --> 00:40:39.663
Hey, give me half
your Which Wich.

00:40:39.687 --> 00:40:41.582
Well, if I wanted to
eat a half a sandwich,

00:40:41.606 --> 00:40:43.375
I'd have brought half
a sandwich, Chet.

00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:44.752
Think you're pretty smart, huh?

00:40:44.776 --> 00:40:46.629
You the one installing
a seven-layer firewall

00:40:46.653 --> 00:40:49.757
to mask a $1/2-billion transaction
at the world's third-largest bank

00:40:49.781 --> 00:40:52.176
using only your wife's
tablet, or is that me?

00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:53.802
Oh, that's right. It's me.

00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.310
- Way to go, Baby Dunc.
- Huh?

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:03.354
What? You... This is your plan!

00:41:03.378 --> 00:41:05.814
No, I said, "Home
Alone-style zip line."

00:41:05.838 --> 00:41:07.566
This is Home Alone 3 at best.

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.110
We were supposed to look cool as
shit coming out of the window,

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.153
doing a badass exit.

00:41:11.177 --> 00:41:13.364
Now we look like a bunch
of losers hanging up here.

00:41:13.388 --> 00:41:14.531
Oh, God.

00:41:16.557 --> 00:41:18.744
- What the fuck?
- The police!

00:41:18.768 --> 00:41:19.995
Hey, we're up here!

00:41:20.019 --> 00:41:22.581
Thank you so much.
Thank you, God.

00:41:22.605 --> 00:41:25.292
Police! Yeah! Holla! Hooty-hoo!

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:28.921
- Oh! Oh, shit.
- What the fuck?

00:41:28.945 --> 00:41:31.256
- Oh, my God.
- What are you doing up there?

00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:33.866
There are people in
the hotel with guns!

00:41:33.992 --> 00:41:35.719
- No!
- Shooting people!

00:41:35.743 --> 00:41:37.429
- You're all fuckin' pigs!
- Get us down!

00:41:37.453 --> 00:41:38.806
Fuck you, copper!

00:41:38.830 --> 00:41:40.641
They're here to help us.

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:43.352
We're not gonna look cool as
shit getting saved by the LAPD.

00:41:43.376 --> 00:41:44.979
Do you even listen
to Kendrick Lamar?

00:41:45.003 --> 00:41:46.838
Are there people up
there with guns or not?

00:41:46.963 --> 00:41:48.607
Yes, there are! That
is one right there!

00:41:48.631 --> 00:41:50.776
He is a man with a gun. He
tried to cut off our dicks.

00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.070
Oh, fuck you. You wish
I touched your dick.

00:41:53.094 --> 00:41:55.114
We're coming up there.
What room number is that?

00:41:55.138 --> 00:41:58.033
- Nine seventeen!
- We're coming up there now!

00:41:58.057 --> 00:41:59.100
Don't fucking move.

00:42:05.148 --> 00:42:06.691
LAPD. Open the door.

00:42:09.777 --> 00:42:11.422
Are you aware you've
got three waiters

00:42:11.446 --> 00:42:13.239
hanging outside the
ninth-floor window?

00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:16.885
Sir, walking away from
a cop is a bad idea.

00:42:16.909 --> 00:42:20.222
I will arrest you for obstruction.
Open the fucking door!

00:42:20.246 --> 00:42:21.748
Shit.

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:26.270
Officer down! Officer down!

00:42:26.294 --> 00:42:27.855
Hank, I need backup!

00:42:27.879 --> 00:42:30.524
I got you, Danny. I'm calling for backup.
I'm coming right now.

00:42:30.548 --> 00:42:32.443
- Stay there!
- No! No, no, no!

00:42:32.467 --> 00:42:35.154
- Don't leave us up here.
- Guys, it's too late. Okay?

00:42:35.178 --> 00:42:36.780
Let's wiggle our
asses back in there,

00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:38.907
kill some bad guys, and get
our fucking check back.

00:42:38.931 --> 00:42:40.576
I'm not risking my
life for the check.

00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.828
Why not? It's our dreams, right?

00:42:42.852 --> 00:42:46.707
No! The check is your dream. My
dream is just working on Skintendo.

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:47.916
But now you can!

00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.919
And we are! Okay? We have been!

00:42:50.943 --> 00:42:52.379
- Baby Dunc...
- Without you!

00:42:55.615 --> 00:42:57.509
Oh, what the fuck?

00:42:58.785 --> 00:43:00.870
Band-Aids and butter beans!
We're online.

00:43:02.038 --> 00:43:04.207
Conrad, we're online.
Awaiting an access code.

00:43:06.417 --> 00:43:08.002
Speak clearly.

00:43:09.212 --> 00:43:10.671
And speak quickly.

00:43:11.631 --> 00:43:13.633
Fuck. Fuck!

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.300
Fifty-three...

00:43:16.385 --> 00:43:17.386
Twenty-two...

00:43:18.554 --> 00:43:20.157
Zero two...

00:43:20.181 --> 00:43:21.492
Zero two...

00:43:21.516 --> 00:43:24.661
- Thirty-three...
- Thirty-three...

00:43:24.685 --> 00:43:26.705
- Sixty-nine.
- Six-nine.

00:43:28.481 --> 00:43:30.459
I want verbal confirmation
from you, Darren.

00:43:30.483 --> 00:43:32.527
Are you working on the
fucking game without me?

00:43:33.152 --> 00:43:34.152
Affirmative.

00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:37.424
You motherfuckers!

00:43:37.448 --> 00:43:40.219
I'm gonna wiggle us back in
there, you backstabbing bitches!

00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:48.268
Sixty-nine, 420, 69.

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:50.270
- I'm serious!
- Sixty-nine, 69, 69.

00:43:50.294 --> 00:43:51.294
Oh, shit!

00:43:56.175 --> 00:43:57.593
What the fuck?

00:44:01.556 --> 00:44:02.723
Conrad, hold on.

00:44:04.392 --> 00:44:05.911
Shit.

00:44:05.935 --> 00:44:07.121
We've had a breach.

00:44:07.145 --> 00:44:08.914
Oh, God.

00:44:08.938 --> 00:44:10.398
Sixth floor, security room.

00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:12.960
What do you mean? Who...
who is it?

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.236
Who the fuck are you? Huh?

00:44:16.404 --> 00:44:17.697
Huh? You SWAT?

00:44:18.197 --> 00:44:19.424
Are you SEALs?

00:44:19.448 --> 00:44:20.867
Transporters?

00:44:21.742 --> 00:44:24.888
Answer me right the fuck now, or
I'll plug you in three seconds.

00:44:24.912 --> 00:44:25.912
Uh...

00:44:29.584 --> 00:44:31.019
- One...
- No.

00:44:31.043 --> 00:44:32.170
Please.

00:44:33.671 --> 00:44:35.173
- Two...
- Please.

00:44:40.469 --> 00:44:41.989
- No!
- No, no. Wait, wait, wait...

00:44:42.013 --> 00:44:43.866
Three!

00:44:47.685 --> 00:44:49.580
Oh, fuck.

00:44:49.604 --> 00:44:51.522
Oh... oh, my God.

00:44:52.106 --> 00:44:54.334
I'm a genius! I
wiggled us back in.

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:57.504
Whoo!

00:44:57.528 --> 00:45:00.340
<i>Donald, kill them and
then enter the code.</i>

00:45:00.364 --> 00:45:02.033
<i>You do have the code,
right, Donald?</i>

00:45:02.783 --> 00:45:03.677
<i>Donald?</i>

00:45:03.701 --> 00:45:04.845
<i>Donald?</i>

00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:09.832
There's a cop at the lobby door.
We shot him.

00:45:10.541 --> 00:45:11.751
But he got away.

00:45:15.254 --> 00:45:16.899
Why are you looking
at me like that, huh?

00:45:16.923 --> 00:45:18.692
You're the sneaky fucks.

00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:21.153
The backstabbers, the
betrayers, the Judas...

00:45:21.177 --> 00:45:22.404
Judases? Judas?

00:45:22.428 --> 00:45:26.033
The one that betrayed Jesus?
Judas, right?

00:45:26.057 --> 00:45:27.576
Yeah, you're the
fucking Judases.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.286
Let's stop with the
name-calling, guys.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.704
- Backstabbers.
- Great.

00:45:30.728 --> 00:45:32.873
Okay, guys, new rule:
always double-check

00:45:32.897 --> 00:45:35.858
that dead bad guys are
actually dead bad guys.

00:45:36.275 --> 00:45:37.836
Holy shit!

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.403
This is a dead bad guy!

00:45:40.154 --> 00:45:43.926
I don't know, I feel like my dead bad guy
is way worse than your dead bad guy.

00:45:43.950 --> 00:45:45.719
"My dead bad"? That's
not your dead bad guy.

00:45:45.743 --> 00:45:47.220
These are just dead bad guys.

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:49.580
Looks like a human-sized
ketchup packet exploded.

00:45:50.915 --> 00:45:52.517
- Damn it.
- What?

00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:54.102
Computer's busted. I
can't get online.

00:45:54.126 --> 00:45:56.980
Yeah, he is full-on spaghetti
and meat sauce down here.

00:45:57.004 --> 00:46:00.383
- Guys. I found a phone.
- What?

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:03.737
Wait a second.

00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:05.864
Why does the dead bad guy
have this dude's number?

00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:08.283
- Who?
- What are you, a fucking owl?

00:46:08.307 --> 00:46:10.869
Yeah, I would love to
be an owl, Darren.

00:46:10.893 --> 00:46:13.562
So I could soar off into the
night hella majestically.

00:46:22.571 --> 00:46:25.324
Wait, you have a phone? You
have to call for help.

00:46:26.283 --> 00:46:29.054
Shh. No.

00:46:29.078 --> 00:46:30.389
I think he just screened me.

00:46:30.413 --> 00:46:33.058
He screened the dead guy.
Don't take it personally.

00:46:33.082 --> 00:46:34.434
Shut up. Voicemail.

00:46:34.458 --> 00:46:36.812
Hey, this is Darren and Joel.

00:46:36.836 --> 00:46:38.105
Yeah, I'm here too, so...

00:46:38.129 --> 00:46:41.108
And Alexxx. The, uh... the
Dew'd Crew from the roof.

00:46:41.132 --> 00:46:42.359
- Remember?
- Say "Skintendo."

00:46:42.383 --> 00:46:44.277
We are calling to find
out what's going on.

00:46:44.301 --> 00:46:46.363
There's, like... people
shooting and stuff.

00:46:46.387 --> 00:46:49.449
Please give me a call back at this number,
uh, when it's a good time for you.

00:46:49.473 --> 00:46:50.659
Okay, give me the phone.

00:46:50.683 --> 00:46:52.536
- We'll talk then.
- It's not a conference call.

00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:54.621
We're not waiting for
him to call back.

00:46:54.645 --> 00:46:57.249
You didn't even bring up the
two most important things:

00:46:57.273 --> 00:47:01.253
the Bey and, I don't know,
how about the fucking check?

00:47:01.277 --> 00:47:02.963
- Come on.
- The check.

00:47:02.987 --> 00:47:04.715
Mention a dead body.
That'd be nice.

00:47:04.739 --> 00:47:06.425
Been a while since
I've left a voicemail.

00:47:06.449 --> 00:47:07.718
I'm gonna call him back, so...

00:47:07.742 --> 00:47:10.053
It's rude to just call right back.
You leave a message,

00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:11.596
- let them call you back.
- Darren...

00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:17.352
Ahmad, you dumb fuck. You
gotta call somebody, yo.

00:47:17.376 --> 00:47:20.772
- Fuck the police. Except for right now.
- You're gonna get us killed.

00:47:20.796 --> 00:47:23.775
You didn't turn it in. You're
putting everyone's lives at risk.

00:47:23.799 --> 00:47:25.944
I'm sorry, is there something
we should be discussing?

00:47:25.968 --> 00:47:27.029
No.

00:47:32.725 --> 00:47:35.495
Hold up.

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:38.874
Why aren't you taking his phone?

00:47:38.898 --> 00:47:40.375
No, I don't see any phone.

00:47:40.399 --> 00:47:42.544
Um, you guys just
be quiet over here.

00:47:42.568 --> 00:47:45.338
Your fucking creepy blue eyes
don't see the phone lighting up

00:47:45.362 --> 00:47:46.757
in his pocket right there?

00:47:46.781 --> 00:47:49.801
Also, it's making a noise.
It's going, "vuh, voo, vuh."

00:47:49.825 --> 00:47:51.327
It's over!

00:47:52.161 --> 00:47:54.306
Cut me free. Now!

00:47:54.330 --> 00:47:57.309
Wait, wait, wait. Hey...
this is not my fault.

00:47:57.333 --> 00:48:00.228
Erma derailed the entire operation
the moment she got here.

00:48:00.252 --> 00:48:02.064
And has anyone
noticed her accent?

00:48:02.088 --> 00:48:05.525
The German accent? It's fake!
She grew up in Pacoima!

00:48:05.549 --> 00:48:07.110
Come on. She's a lunatic!

00:48:07.134 --> 00:48:08.695
Is this true, Erma?

00:48:08.719 --> 00:48:10.805
Yeah, I'm a lunatic.

00:48:11.222 --> 00:48:13.825
No, no, no. No. Give me...

00:48:13.849 --> 00:48:15.911
- Give me the gun.
- Gladly. See, told you.

00:48:15.935 --> 00:48:17.829
- I mean, what was I supposed to do?
- Right.

00:48:17.853 --> 00:48:19.647
Kill her. Like this.

00:48:30.533 --> 00:48:32.803
Lovely.

00:48:32.827 --> 00:48:35.680
Honestly, did not know
I was gonna do that.

00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:37.182
This whole thing was you?

00:48:37.206 --> 00:48:38.850
Mm, giving orders the whole time

00:48:38.874 --> 00:48:43.230
from the... "dusty-ass
BlackBerry" in my pocket.

00:48:43.254 --> 00:48:46.399
Physical keyboards aren't
so stupid now, are they?

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:48.652
Nah, they're still dumb as fuck,

00:48:48.676 --> 00:48:52.656
and you still got atrocious-ass
halitosis, but I'm surprised.

00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:56.827
Yeah, well, at least my breath doesn't
smell like old-ass hyena pussy.

00:48:56.851 --> 00:48:58.435
Oh, God.

00:49:01.438 --> 00:49:05.234
- Hello, Donald, you cheeky sausage.
- What?

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:08.088
No, I think that
Donald guy's dead.

00:49:08.112 --> 00:49:09.714
He either was sucked
out of a window,

00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:12.008
or he choked on a computer.
So what's going on up there?

00:49:12.032 --> 00:49:14.970
- Speakerphone.
- Who is this?

00:49:14.994 --> 00:49:17.013
- Speaker.
- I'm going on speakerphone.

00:49:17.037 --> 00:49:18.098
- Dew'd Crew here.
- Hey.

00:49:18.122 --> 00:49:19.516
Lumber Jacks...

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:21.834
- What? Uh, hi?
- How's the Bey doing?

00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.063
Wait, why do you have
this guy's number?

00:49:26.714 --> 00:49:27.983
Wait, are you a bad guy too?

00:49:28.007 --> 00:49:30.318
Well, I suppose so, yes.

00:49:30.342 --> 00:49:35.598
But, um, you have just forced me
to become... unmistakably evil.

00:49:38.642 --> 00:49:40.603
Oh, fuck.

00:49:41.353 --> 00:49:43.039
I'll take the access codes now.

00:49:43.063 --> 00:49:44.063
Nah.

00:49:44.857 --> 00:49:47.961
Sorry, motherfucker. Can't do it.
That dude? I didn't know him.

00:49:47.985 --> 00:49:50.463
Shit, he might've let me live
if I gave him the codes.

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:52.174
But you? Fuck you.

00:49:52.198 --> 00:49:54.843
I know if I give you
the codes, I'm dead.

00:49:54.867 --> 00:49:56.678
And I know why.

00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:58.555
'Cause I made you eat
that hooker's booty

00:49:58.579 --> 00:50:00.265
at my birthday party, isn't it?

00:50:02.082 --> 00:50:05.729
This motherfucker ate a hooker's booty.
You had crabs in your teeth for a week.

00:50:05.753 --> 00:50:07.689
Remember shoving your face

00:50:07.713 --> 00:50:10.442
right up in that crab-infested
booty hole, bro?

00:50:10.466 --> 00:50:12.194
'Cause I do, you fucking loser.

00:50:12.218 --> 00:50:15.780
You dumb fucking fuck-hole.

00:50:15.804 --> 00:50:19.284
- You fucking suck.
- Very well.

00:50:19.308 --> 00:50:21.912
I'll acquire my
compensation another way.

00:50:21.936 --> 00:50:24.581
And while I wait to
get paid, I'll...

00:50:24.605 --> 00:50:26.875
torture you. And kill you.

00:50:26.899 --> 00:50:30.712
Erma! We are sending a video to
the United States government.

00:50:30.736 --> 00:50:34.841
Oh! Also... bring me Shaggy.

00:50:34.865 --> 00:50:36.075
What the hell's going on?

00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:39.137
The fucking butler?

00:50:41.372 --> 00:50:43.082
Hey, guys, check it out.

00:50:47.127 --> 00:50:48.563
Whoa.

00:50:48.587 --> 00:50:50.130
Pigs brought the whole farm.

00:50:51.090 --> 00:50:53.652
- Yeah.
- Turn on the news.

00:50:53.676 --> 00:50:54.843
Turn on the news.

00:50:55.636 --> 00:50:57.304
Okay.

00:50:58.931 --> 00:51:00.367
<i>Steve-O!</i>

00:51:00.391 --> 00:51:02.035
- There, there, there.
<i>- Steve-O!</i>

00:51:02.059 --> 00:51:03.954
<i>Give me that mic.
Give me that mic!</i>

00:51:03.978 --> 00:51:06.164
<i>Steve-O, if you can hear
me in the spirit world...</i>

00:51:06.188 --> 00:51:08.375
<i>I love you, brother.</i>

00:51:08.399 --> 00:51:10.669
<i>It should've been you!
It should've been you.</i>

00:51:10.693 --> 00:51:13.362
<i>You. And</i> Channel 8.

00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:17.008
<i>Uh, okay, I'm... I'm just being
told we've received a video</i>

00:51:17.032 --> 00:51:18.677
<i>from the terrorists.</i>

00:51:18.701 --> 00:51:22.204
<i>Warning: what you're about to see may
not be suitable for younger viewers.</i>

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:24.182
<i>Good evening.</i>

00:51:24.206 --> 00:51:28.043
<i>As you probably know, I've taken control
of the Level Hotel, Los Angeles.</i>

00:51:28.669 --> 00:51:30.772
<i>I had intentions of
only taking money</i>

00:51:30.796 --> 00:51:33.632
<i>from a disrespectful and
arrogant billionaire child...</i>

00:51:34.842 --> 00:51:37.970
<i>but that was derailed by
some idiotic waiters.</i>

00:51:38.512 --> 00:51:40.156
Are we the idiotics?

00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:41.783
No, stupid. We're maids.

00:51:41.807 --> 00:51:46.705
<i>So now I'm holding 106 hostages
until I receive $500 million</i>

00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:49.249
<i>and a helicopter, which I
will fly out of the U.S.</i>

00:51:49.273 --> 00:51:53.378
<i>and release... the
remaining hostages.</i>

00:51:53.402 --> 00:51:57.197
<i>Oh, I should add: any breach of
this building will trigger...</i>

00:51:58.073 --> 00:52:00.302
<i>an explosive collar,</i>

00:52:00.326 --> 00:52:02.554
<i>creating a mess no one
wants to clean up.</i>

00:52:02.578 --> 00:52:06.808
<i>Additionally, I will kill one
hostage every 15 minutes</i>

00:52:06.832 --> 00:52:11.021
<i>to ensure prompt payment,
starting... now.</i>

00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:13.398
<i>Oh, shit. That's hot.</i>

00:52:13.422 --> 00:52:16.443
<i>Bro... listen, man, listen.
We brothers. We brothers.</i>

00:52:16.467 --> 00:52:18.719
<i>We're supposed to
be brothers, man!</i>

00:52:19.803 --> 00:52:22.365
<i>- I could get you
Stacey Dash's number.</i>

00:52:22.389 --> 00:52:24.534
Oh, shit!

00:52:24.558 --> 00:52:26.369
No, no, no, no. What?

00:52:26.393 --> 00:52:29.331
<i>As you can see, I'm holding
up my end of the bargain.</i>

00:52:29.355 --> 00:52:30.790
<i>I hope you do the same.</i>

00:52:30.814 --> 00:52:34.669
<i>And now, on a lighter note,
another must-see TV moment:</i>

00:52:34.693 --> 00:52:37.863
<i>a very chill performance...
by Shaggy.</i>

00:52:39.448 --> 00:52:40.884
<i>Yeah, uh...</i>

00:52:40.896 --> 00:52:42.344
<i>Don't kill Shaggy. I
fuckin' love Shaggy.</i>

00:52:42.368 --> 00:52:44.679
- What is happening?
- Don't kill Shaggy. Don't kill Shaggy.

00:52:44.703 --> 00:52:49.142
<i>I wanna do this song that I wrote for
the earthquake victims of Haiti.</i>

00:52:49.166 --> 00:52:50.584
- <i>Sing "It Wasn't Me"!
</i>- Uh...

00:52:51.543 --> 00:52:54.022
<i>Dude, that's not really appropriate for...
for what...</i>

00:52:54.046 --> 00:52:56.274
<i>No one wants to hear
that Haiti shit!</i>

00:52:56.298 --> 00:52:58.735
<i>Okay? They want "It Wasn't
Me." I want "It Wasn't Me."</i>

00:52:58.759 --> 00:52:59.944
<i>Sing "It Wasn't Me."</i>

00:52:59.968 --> 00:53:01.738
- Sing it!
- Shaggy, please!

00:53:01.762 --> 00:53:02.846

00:53:34.378 --> 00:53:37.190
Shag, too soon, but I'm out.

00:53:37.214 --> 00:53:40.652
Yeah, yo, by all means.

00:53:40.676 --> 00:53:42.556
What's the nearest room
that can accommodate us?

00:53:42.678 --> 00:53:44.155
Uh, the conference room.

00:53:44.179 --> 00:53:47.534
But, ooh, it's dressed for
a convention tomorrow,

00:53:47.558 --> 00:53:50.286
so if you don't mind, I would
appreciate if we just stayed upstairs,

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.496
not to mess it up.

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.456
- Take everyone to the conference room!
- Okay.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.833
Come on, let's move.

00:53:54.857 --> 00:53:58.086
I don't herd cattle.
I'll be hunting waiters.

00:53:58.110 --> 00:54:00.988
Bilbo, Dildo, you come with me.

00:54:01.864 --> 00:54:05.510
You don't ask for respect, little girl.
You take it.

00:54:08.662 --> 00:54:10.557
Move it, ladies. You got legs.
Use 'em.

00:54:10.581 --> 00:54:12.517
- Move it, people.
- What the fuck is the holdup?

00:54:12.541 --> 00:54:15.562
- Everybody out.
- Keep moving! Let's go!

00:54:15.586 --> 00:54:17.129
Come on!

00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:22.509
Darren, look.

00:54:24.178 --> 00:54:25.238
They're going inside.

00:54:25.262 --> 00:54:26.305
So what?

00:54:26.972 --> 00:54:28.366
So they're contained.

00:54:28.390 --> 00:54:31.435
You can't contain
machine guns, Darren.

00:54:31.894 --> 00:54:33.562
How much salvia did you smoke?

00:54:34.771 --> 00:54:36.833
Shit, how much more
do you have of that?

00:54:36.857 --> 00:54:39.794
I mean, there's a lot here,
but it is covered in glass.

00:54:39.818 --> 00:54:42.172
Not the sandwich, your salvia.
How much?

00:54:42.196 --> 00:54:44.907
Oh, so now you want my help.

00:54:45.407 --> 00:54:46.843
Hmm, sure.

00:54:46.867 --> 00:54:48.619
Grab those guns and follow moi.

00:54:57.794 --> 00:55:00.380
You got glass. You got
glass in your hair.

00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:07.238
I'm flippin' keys.

00:55:07.262 --> 00:55:11.493
Well, not yet, actually. I've got
some serious rebranding to do.

00:55:11.517 --> 00:55:15.788
Turns out salvia isn't a very sexy drug
and no one likes it except for Darren...

00:55:15.812 --> 00:55:17.624
And, weirdly, the
JV softball team.

00:55:17.648 --> 00:55:20.710
- Those girls get fuckin' wild.
- Okay, yeah, whatever, man.

00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:22.945
- This is perfect. This is great.
- Okay.

00:55:24.404 --> 00:55:27.074
Alexxx? Do you live here?

00:55:27.491 --> 00:55:29.344
Because it looks
like you live here.

00:55:29.368 --> 00:55:32.347
I don't live here. No, you
know who I think lives here?

00:55:32.371 --> 00:55:33.515
Josué.

00:55:33.539 --> 00:55:36.750
Yeah, the maintenance guy? That guy's...
that guy's a weirdo.

00:55:37.167 --> 00:55:39.437
Yeah, like I was saying
about the rebranding...

00:55:39.461 --> 00:55:43.525
um, you know, like the Marlboro
man, but this is "Uncle Sal."

00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:45.985
Sal-via? Get it?

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:49.197
Dude, there's, like, a "Buffalo Bill went
to Costco" amount of lotion over here.

00:55:49.221 --> 00:55:52.641
- Pfft. Hey, the salvia's back here, so...
- Yeah, yeah.

00:55:53.183 --> 00:55:55.828
Oh! And what is this?

00:55:55.852 --> 00:55:58.164
This is an oil painting
of you on a throne

00:55:58.188 --> 00:55:59.916
with money hanging
out of your pockets

00:55:59.940 --> 00:56:02.168
and a bunch of tits
hovering around your head.

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.712
Seems like he... he's a true
artist for real, but...

00:56:04.736 --> 00:56:06.089
that is weird, admittedly.

00:56:06.113 --> 00:56:08.341
- Salvia is this way, so...
- Yeah, okay.

00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:10.284
So Josué is up here
painting you and...

00:56:11.368 --> 00:56:15.848
beating off to a porno parody of your
favorite childhood movie, Flubber?

00:56:15.872 --> 00:56:17.850
<i>"Flubbher." That's funny.</i>

00:56:17.874 --> 00:56:19.185
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

00:56:19.209 --> 00:56:20.419
Huh.

00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:26.234
Fine! Yes, I live here, okay? I jerk
off up here. I paint myself here.

00:56:26.258 --> 00:56:28.945
I jerk off while painting myself.
Is that what you wanted to hear?

00:56:28.969 --> 00:56:30.530
- Jesus Christ.
- This isn't that bad.

00:56:30.554 --> 00:56:31.781
I'm saving up all the money,

00:56:31.805 --> 00:56:33.866
so I'm gonna buy a Maybach
in like six years.

00:56:33.890 --> 00:56:36.828
I'm an adult homeless man
stuck in a balling-ass body,

00:56:36.852 --> 00:56:38.663
but I put my pride aside

00:56:38.687 --> 00:56:40.874
and took you to my grow house
to save the fucking day.

00:56:40.898 --> 00:56:43.626
- So you're welcome.
- Well, it's a grow closet at best,

00:56:43.650 --> 00:56:46.671
but it's definitely enough salvia to
hotbox the whole conference room.

00:56:46.695 --> 00:56:49.716
I mean, we can knock them on their
asses, take their weapons, lock them in.

00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.051
- We could kill 'em.
- No, not kill them.

00:56:52.075 --> 00:56:54.012
What do you mean? You
guys already got a kill.

00:56:54.036 --> 00:56:57.432
I haven't gotten a kill yet, so it's...
It's kind of fair that I'd get one.

00:56:57.456 --> 00:56:58.850
You can have my kill.

00:56:58.874 --> 00:57:00.560
I don't want your kill.
I want my own.

00:57:00.584 --> 00:57:02.770
Look... I like this plan.

00:57:02.794 --> 00:57:06.232
Cool, good. We gotta figure out how to
get the smoke into the conference room.

00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:08.526
I'm thinking the maintenance breezeway.
The vents there?

00:57:08.550 --> 00:57:09.944
If we can go in the ducts...

00:57:09.968 --> 00:57:11.571
No, I don't... I can't.

00:57:11.595 --> 00:57:13.072
Figure it out. Look at all this.

00:57:13.096 --> 00:57:14.741
- Build something, man.
- I mean,

00:57:14.765 --> 00:57:16.350
there's a ton of lotion.

00:57:17.142 --> 00:57:19.704
What, we should just jerk the
goons off into submission?

00:57:19.728 --> 00:57:21.164
Just build something, man!

00:57:21.188 --> 00:57:23.291
This is a trash heap. There's
nothing I can use here.

00:57:23.315 --> 00:57:25.150
Yeah, this is all my
belongings, so...

00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:28.504
Hold on.

00:57:28.528 --> 00:57:32.050
I got it. I got it! I'll draw it up
so you know what I'm talking about.

00:57:32.074 --> 00:57:34.385
Oh, the wheels are turning!

00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:36.304
All right. So what
do I get to do?

00:57:36.328 --> 00:57:38.222
You? Oh, nothing.

00:57:38.246 --> 00:57:40.999
You just stay out of the way.
Okay? You've done enough.

00:57:43.460 --> 00:57:45.146
On your feet!

00:57:45.170 --> 00:57:46.463
On your feet now!

00:57:49.257 --> 00:57:51.027
- Ooh, tough guy.
- Shut up.

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.947
- Shut up!
- Yeah, you smell bad.

00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:56.098
What, did you shit
in your pants?

00:57:56.556 --> 00:57:57.951
Shit.

00:57:57.975 --> 00:57:59.869
Wow, wow. You think
I'm scared of you

00:57:59.893 --> 00:58:02.789
'cause you got a gun in my face?
Fuck off.

00:58:02.813 --> 00:58:04.582
Bet you think you're
gonna buy respect

00:58:04.606 --> 00:58:06.209
with all that money too, huh?

00:58:06.233 --> 00:58:08.127
Well, it bought you respect.

00:58:08.151 --> 00:58:11.363
What, you think these people like
you because they follow you online?

00:58:12.656 --> 00:58:14.801
You know, half his
followers are bots.

00:58:14.825 --> 00:58:16.886
Okay? He's not as
famous as you think.

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:19.889
Yo, point is, I blow
their fucking minds.

00:58:19.913 --> 00:58:21.999
All you do is hate and take.

00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:27.188
Well, um... why don't we...

00:58:27.212 --> 00:58:29.840
"blow their minds" now?

00:58:32.926 --> 00:58:34.219
You there. Bring him over here.

00:58:34.720 --> 00:58:37.031
I didn't do anything.
What's going on?

00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:40.201
Oh, no, no. Jesus... oh, God.

00:58:40.225 --> 00:58:41.411
Please don't hurt me.

00:58:41.435 --> 00:58:44.104
My intentions are to
do quite the opposite.

00:58:45.689 --> 00:58:47.834
Strip his pants. Bend
him over the table.

00:58:47.858 --> 00:58:50.027
No. What the fuck?

00:58:50.569 --> 00:58:51.903
What...? No.

00:58:53.572 --> 00:58:54.572
Oh, Jesus.

00:58:55.866 --> 00:58:56.866
Let me up.

00:58:57.284 --> 00:58:58.827
You made me eat that...

00:59:00.579 --> 00:59:04.058
hooker ass.

00:59:04.082 --> 00:59:05.459
Yeah.

00:59:06.585 --> 00:59:09.564
Now let's see you
muster any respect

00:59:09.588 --> 00:59:13.818
after you toss this
fat fuck's salad.

00:59:13.842 --> 00:59:15.594
Whoa, whoa. Ahmad! Ahmad.

00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:18.114
Whoa, it's so dark.

00:59:18.138 --> 00:59:20.640
Do it, or he's a dead man.

00:59:21.266 --> 00:59:23.310
All right, I just wanna
say one thing, dog.

00:59:24.561 --> 00:59:25.687
Didn't have to be this way.

00:59:28.273 --> 00:59:29.333
Oh!

00:59:34.696 --> 00:59:35.822
Stop...

00:59:36.907 --> 00:59:40.261
What the fuck? Ooh,
what the fuck?

00:59:40.285 --> 00:59:44.932
- Yeah.
- Ooh. Wait... wait, okay.

00:59:44.956 --> 00:59:46.684
Whoa. Are you guys seeing this?

00:59:46.708 --> 00:59:49.270
Do you see this?
Bey's eating my ass.

00:59:49.294 --> 00:59:53.149
I'm getting my salad
tossed by Bey!

00:59:53.173 --> 00:59:54.901
Someone 'Gram this!

00:59:54.925 --> 00:59:57.570
- Right, enough...
- I'm not done, motherfucker!

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.307
All right, stop it! Get him up.
Up. Enough, enough!

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:04.351
Just a little bit longer.

01:00:05.435 --> 01:00:06.412
What happened?

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.039
You tried to embarrass me?

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:09.499
I done fucked 10,000 women.

01:00:09.523 --> 01:00:12.293
You don't think I ate a grip
of dude-booties along the way?

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:14.611
Yeah-yeah!

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.864
You may not be able to feel
embarrassment. I get it.

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:20.593
But prepare to feel suffering.

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:25.598
Let's try this again.

01:00:25.622 --> 01:00:29.102
Bring me the correct
corresponding breach sensor.

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:38.402
Oh, I-I hope he can swim.
Ah! Oh!

01:00:38.426 --> 01:00:40.387
- What...
- Oh, oh, oh.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.824
- What the fuck, man?
- Squat.

01:00:42.848 --> 01:00:44.474
Okay.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.869
These. We know what these do.

01:00:46.893 --> 01:00:48.955
- No. Ahmad, Ahmad...
- Yeah.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:52.023
Oh, oh. Oh, is that... yeah.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:00:59.549
Lower.

01:00:59.573 --> 01:01:00.949
Lower.

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:02.616
Perfect.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:05.912
Fuck, they got Chet!

01:01:06.454 --> 01:01:09.583
How the fuck is that possible?
They're fuckin' waiters.

01:01:13.128 --> 01:01:14.462
Weren't you just

01:01:15.046 --> 01:01:18.466
a fucking garbageman
a few years ago?

01:01:24.055 --> 01:01:25.307
This way.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.020
I don't really appreciate you putting
my résumé in the street like that.

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:31.873
Tell me you were driving

01:01:31.897 --> 01:01:33.732
- the fucking truck.
- Fuck you, man.

01:01:40.739 --> 01:01:42.425
- That should do it.
- Good.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.177
All right, so we patch
into the air duct.

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:46.596
We hit the switch. We
wait 30, 45 seconds.

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.080
Until the bad guys pass out. We
zip tie them, take their guns,

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:52.018
and free the hostages. I know.
It's my plan.

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:54.044
Okay, cool. You can have
a sticker or something.

01:01:54.169 --> 01:01:55.689
- What are you doing? Come on.
- Sorry.

01:01:56.713 --> 01:01:58.316
All right, pick a gun.

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.943
No, no. I am not using a gun.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:03.362
All right? My brain
is my weapon.

01:02:03.386 --> 01:02:05.072
And it is fully loaded, sir.

01:02:05.096 --> 01:02:07.700
Okay, fine. Then you
wheel the cart.

01:02:07.724 --> 01:02:10.352
What did I say? Please don't
do that, okay? Just...

01:02:11.144 --> 01:02:12.479
grab the extension cord.

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:14.397
Let's go.

01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:40.691
- You feeling tired yet?
- Fuck you.

01:02:40.715 --> 01:02:42.860
You're like the worst
Bond villain ever.

01:02:42.884 --> 01:02:44.779
You might as well just
kill me, 'cause...

01:02:44.803 --> 01:02:47.138
I ain't gettin' tired.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:50.183
Well, Lil Puma looks
kind of tuckered out.

01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:52.852
Maybe we should put him
out of his misery.

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:26.612
Wowee!

01:03:26.636 --> 01:03:29.407
Now, that... that was fun.
Oh, God.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:30.616
Take respect.

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.909
- Don't ask.
- Yeah!

01:03:31.933 --> 01:03:33.494
- Take.
- Oh!

01:03:33.518 --> 01:03:35.705
Did you see all the fuckin'
blood in that water?

01:03:35.729 --> 01:03:39.458
How much blood was in that dog?
It's like a fuckin' bloodhound!

01:03:39.482 --> 01:03:40.501
All right, mister!

01:03:40.525 --> 01:03:44.714
I think we have all had
just about enough! Right?

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:47.675
Your treatment of our hotel
guest is unacceptable,

01:03:47.699 --> 01:03:51.095
not to mention your complete and
utter disregard for hotel property!

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.139
And you killed the
little rat puppy!

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:57.101
As acting manager of the Level
Hotel, I am telling you,

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:58.853
this ends now!

01:03:58.877 --> 01:04:01.087
Oh, God.

01:04:03.131 --> 01:04:05.234
Just... There you are.

01:04:05.258 --> 01:04:06.343
That's better.

01:04:08.094 --> 01:04:09.304
Look at the time.

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:13.767
It appears the U.S. government
doesn't care about you.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:17.187
In 60 seconds, someone will die.

01:04:18.313 --> 01:04:20.774
But, uh, I think I'm
done with killing.

01:04:21.316 --> 01:04:24.694
For a little while,
at least, um...

01:04:27.572 --> 01:04:28.674
Don't talk.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.135
- You.
- Oh, shit.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:32.178
No. Babe.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:34.180
Do something.
Volunteer as tribute.

01:04:34.204 --> 01:04:35.222
- Do something!
- Up.

01:04:35.246 --> 01:04:36.974
Do something! Oh, God. Okay.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:38.625
And...

01:04:40.919 --> 01:04:43.147
No way. You.

01:04:43.171 --> 01:04:44.857
Cut them free, please.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:45.881
Step forward.

01:04:53.264 --> 01:04:54.617
Now...

01:04:54.641 --> 01:04:55.767
fight to the death.

01:04:57.394 --> 01:04:59.246
What? No.

01:04:59.270 --> 01:05:02.333
I'm sending this... Oh!

01:05:02.357 --> 01:05:04.234
To the news next.

01:05:05.276 --> 01:05:07.380
- Look, I'm not killing her.
- Okay.

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.323
One of you kill the other...
or I shoot you both.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:14.929
<i>Look, anybody who can see
this, I don't wanna do this!</i>

01:05:14.953 --> 01:05:17.390
<i>I am not a murderer!</i>

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:18.873
<i>You got that right!</i>

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:21.876
- Christ.
<i>- Shit, I killed him.</i>

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:23.837
<i>J-Joel...</i>

01:05:24.546 --> 01:05:26.232
<i>Now, that's what I
call television.</i>

01:05:26.256 --> 01:05:27.691
<i>But let's not do it again.</i>

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:29.676
<i>Bring me my money,
my helicopter.</i>

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:32.988
- Did they put the money together yet?
- Just now.

01:05:33.012 --> 01:05:34.615
Tell 'em to get the
chopper up now.

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:35.639
Yes, sir.

01:05:37.267 --> 01:05:39.394
Hey, dude. Keep it down.

01:05:49.904 --> 01:05:52.174
Hey. Hurry the fuck up.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:54.093
Okay, do you want me
to be fast or quiet?

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:56.011
'Cause that guy's about
to kill somebody.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:58.121
Come on, go, go, go, go, go, go.

01:06:07.088 --> 01:06:08.798
Come on, come on, move it.

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.294
It was just working. Oop.

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:29.962
You're gonna die so
fast compared to me.

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:31.964
Okay. It's ready.

01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.675
- I got the torch. Need a lighter.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.

01:06:34.699 --> 01:06:36.594
Okay, just hand it to me.
All right.

01:06:36.618 --> 01:06:38.053
And, uh, plug in the fan.

01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:40.288
- Hurry!
- I'm going to. Where's the extension cord?

01:06:41.331 --> 01:06:42.975
Oh, was I supposed
to bring that?

01:06:42.999 --> 01:06:44.709
Yeah, I said bring it.

01:06:45.418 --> 01:06:48.588
Yeah, well, you also said
you didn't need my help.

01:06:49.172 --> 01:06:51.775
Then you cut me out
of the Skintendo.

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:54.427
So, I don't know, I guess I
was just a little confused.

01:06:56.346 --> 01:06:59.057
- Alexxx, no.
- Dude.

01:06:59.432 --> 01:07:01.827
Please do not be a
complete piece of shit

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.746
and tell me you brought
that extension cord.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.896
Mm-mm-mm.

01:07:05.647 --> 01:07:08.209
You're playing games because we
wouldn't let you be in charge?

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:10.461
Dude, those people
are counting on us.

01:07:10.485 --> 01:07:13.380
Forget it. It's fine. Just... you're
gonna have to build a longer tube,

01:07:13.404 --> 01:07:14.298
some kind of conduit.

01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:17.134
Just get some more fucking...
grocery bags or...

01:07:17.158 --> 01:07:18.636
- Uh...
- No, no, no.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:19.553
Fuck you.

01:07:19.577 --> 01:07:22.973
You are so fucking
selfish, it's disgusting.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:27.394
I'm serious when I say
this, as maybe a friend,

01:07:27.418 --> 01:07:28.812
but you better...
watch your back.

01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:30.189
Dude, you watch your back.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:31.857
- No, dude, behind you!
- Watch your back!

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:37.196
Fuck!

01:07:37.220 --> 01:07:39.323
Don't shoot them, you idiot.

01:07:39.347 --> 01:07:40.640
They're mine.

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.536
Damn it.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:57.824
Well, well.

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:02.120
Looks like Little Miss Tough Girl
ain't so tough anymore, is she?

01:08:03.871 --> 01:08:06.708
We gonna have some fun.

01:08:10.587 --> 01:08:12.964
- Split up!
- Split up!

01:08:14.257 --> 01:08:16.342
Shit! Go this way!

01:08:20.179 --> 01:08:21.657
- No!
- Oh, shit!

01:08:21.681 --> 01:08:22.950
What are you doing? Split up!

01:08:22.974 --> 01:08:24.726
- Yeah, we did!
- I meant all of us.

01:08:25.351 --> 01:08:28.855
I need a minute, man. I got to
take a little trip somewhere.

01:08:29.230 --> 01:08:31.584
What? Oh, fuck no.

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:34.420
You're gonna smoke salvia while
we're being hunted by murderers?

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:35.504
That's right. Know why?

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:37.756
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm
being hunted by murderers.

01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:40.116
Oh, yeah, suck it down,
you fuckin' sicko.

01:08:44.078 --> 01:08:45.848
What about Alexxx, man?
We got to find him.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:49.184
Shit!

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:10.331
Get ready to be my first kill!

01:09:10.355 --> 01:09:13.358
Yeah? Be prepared
to be my millionth.

01:09:16.361 --> 01:09:17.361
Yeah, right!

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.548
If you'd said nine or ten,

01:09:19.572 --> 01:09:21.634
I'd be like, "This guy's a
murderer," but a million?

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.136
It's way too many!
That's too many murders!

01:09:24.160 --> 01:09:25.370
No!

01:09:41.386 --> 01:09:42.386
No!

01:09:54.941 --> 01:09:57.002
Oh, God!

01:09:57.026 --> 01:10:01.280
I'm gonna fucking kill
you, you son of a bitch.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.492
My bad.

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:08.538
Oh! I'm so sorry!

01:10:09.247 --> 01:10:12.208
I'm sorry! I don't want to!

01:10:14.752 --> 01:10:16.754
Fuck you!

01:10:30.643 --> 01:10:31.643
Follow me.

01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:43.156
Great. Back in El
Jizzblaster's room.

01:10:44.031 --> 01:10:46.075
- So what now?
- Nothing.

01:10:47.160 --> 01:10:49.304
Okay? We're done.

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:52.015
You ruined our best shot
at ending all this.

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:53.332
Fuck you!

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:57.295
Okay, good. You're fired up.

01:10:57.879 --> 01:11:00.357
So I won't take that personally.
Now let's use that energy...

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.942
Alexxx, take it personally.

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:04.552
We're done following
you around for good.

01:11:08.139 --> 01:11:12.745
Whatever. You guys are doing
A-okay without me, right?

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.080
Working in secret on
the Skintendo Joysuit?

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:16.623
How long has that
been going on, huh?

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:18.000
Jesus Christ. Years.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:21.920
I can't believe I followed a
loser like you around for years.

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:23.297
I'm not a loser!

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:26.532
Whoa! Hey! No!

01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.720
You just shot at me?

01:11:29.744 --> 01:11:31.871
I shot near you, bitch.

01:11:32.997 --> 01:11:33.998
Okay.

01:11:35.291 --> 01:11:36.291
Me too, then.

01:11:39.337 --> 01:11:40.463
You son of a...

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.028
Guys! Stop.

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:47.279
Shut up, Baby Dunc.

01:11:47.303 --> 01:11:50.515
My name is Joel, you idiots!

01:11:54.519 --> 01:11:56.646
Oh, shit! Oh!

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:01.316
Oh!

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.595
Oh, I wish this were
fucking loaded, dude,

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:14.139
'cause then I would put it there
right through your skull!

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:16.683
Well, if this was loaded, I'd
come sideways on you like ka-kow.

01:12:16.707 --> 01:12:19.561
Really? 'Cause it'd come out the other
side, and I'd just suture it up.

01:12:19.585 --> 01:12:21.522
Oh, okay, well, then my
gun has a bayonet on it,

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:22.981
and I'd, ugh,
un-suture your face!

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:24.858
Oh, really? Guess what.
I got more sutures.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:27.694
- Suture, suture, suture.
- What, motherfucker? You spell "suture"!

01:12:27.718 --> 01:12:28.761
You spell "suture"!

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:30.429
I'm doing this too.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:35.494
I wish this were
fuckin' loaded, dude.

01:12:38.479 --> 01:12:39.522
This is loaded.

01:12:42.233 --> 01:12:44.193
Rich to Mr. Ahmad. I
found those waiters.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:45.921
We're housekeepers.

01:12:45.945 --> 01:12:49.174
<i>Perfect timing. Bring them to the
conference room. I'll kill them next.</i>

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:51.868
Too late. They're already dead.

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:53.887
Oh, good.

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:55.389
Erma got them?

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:58.124
<i>No, me. I'll be up in five.</i>

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:02.044
Mr. Ahmad. There's a
chopper approaching.

01:13:04.797 --> 01:13:06.215
You guys look exhausted.

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:08.634
Let's hit the spa.

01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:11.053
Move!

01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:16.410
I've been waiting for these
pics for a long-ass time now.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:20.664
Yo, the guys are
gonna love this.

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:22.064
You look motherfucking insane.

01:13:23.691 --> 01:13:26.628
Come on, that shit is funny. I know
you got a big-ass dick on your face,

01:13:26.652 --> 01:13:28.088
but hey, poo-poo head?

01:13:28.112 --> 01:13:29.752
- That's some funny shit right...
- Mm-mm.

01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:32.617
I thought that shit was funny.

01:13:38.748 --> 01:13:40.767
Okay, okay, okay.
You hate America.

01:13:40.791 --> 01:13:42.185
Man, I get that.

01:13:42.209 --> 01:13:43.979
Slavery, drones,

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:46.607
they just discontinued the KFC
Double Down out of nowhere,

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:48.650
but, like, come on,
man, we're good guys.

01:13:51.886 --> 01:13:53.095
I'm here for the money.

01:13:53.804 --> 01:13:56.658
And after this job, Jared and I were
finally gonna get away from it all.

01:13:56.682 --> 01:13:58.994
Is that the, uh...
the guy upstairs?

01:13:59.018 --> 01:14:01.330
- Yeah, it's the guy upstairs.
- What is that?

01:14:01.354 --> 01:14:02.497
What is that?

01:14:04.607 --> 01:14:07.044
You don't know what it's like
to lose someone like that.

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:08.378
I do.

01:14:08.402 --> 01:14:09.862
I pushed them away myself.

01:14:10.404 --> 01:14:13.741
Oh, fuck.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:17.411
Don't fuck with me, asshole.

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:19.705
I'm just getting started.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.269
Now, you know what? Let's
relax a little bit.

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.711
Let's turn these off.

01:14:26.295 --> 01:14:27.630
There you go.

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:29.130
Now...

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:32.319
What's next on your spa menu...

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:36.389
Have you guys ever had...

01:14:37.014 --> 01:14:39.159
a lava stone massage?

01:14:39.183 --> 01:14:40.494
No.

01:14:40.518 --> 01:14:41.912
We're maids, man.

01:14:41.936 --> 01:14:43.747
We can't even
afford a lava lamp.

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:46.249
Oh, they're fabulous.

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:53.423
Oh, this is gonna feel so good.

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:56.885
For me. It's gonna
really, really hurt you.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:58.136
No. No, no, no!

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.056
- Oh, yeah!
- Fuck!

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.540
Let's get out those knots!

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:06.061
- Stop it! Just stop! Stop doing it.
- Stop!

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:08.504
Please. We're sorry we killed
your friend, seriously.

01:15:09.463 --> 01:15:10.463
My what?

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:13.092
- My what?
- Your friend.

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:15.011
My friend?

01:15:15.761 --> 01:15:18.240
- You sound like my dad!
- Okay.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:19.866
He wasn't my friend!

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.225
He was my everything!

01:15:21.851 --> 01:15:22.744
Ow!

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.705
Hey, fuckface!

01:15:24.729 --> 01:15:28.125
- Alexxx, stop. What are you doing?
- No, no, no, no. Fuck this crybaby.

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:31.211
Oh, why you being such
a fucking cwybaby?

01:15:31.235 --> 01:15:32.945
"Ooh, my lover's dead."

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:34.655
You know what you should do?

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.843
Take your own dick, shove
it up your own butt,

01:15:37.867 --> 01:15:40.053
impregnate it, have a butt baby.

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:42.097
You know what I'd call him?

01:15:42.121 --> 01:15:43.432
Jared Jr.

01:15:43.456 --> 01:15:45.183
- Hey, fuck you.
- Fuck you.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.686
You just earned
yourself a deep tissue.

01:15:47.710 --> 01:15:50.022
This guy and the fucking
puns, am I right?

01:15:54.759 --> 01:15:55.801

Am I dead?

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:38.928
Is he dead?

01:16:41.764 --> 01:16:42.848
Ew.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:45.935
This dude definitely just
shit himself, didn't he?

01:16:46.060 --> 01:16:47.228
Yeah.

01:16:47.812 --> 01:16:50.106
That was a really good
idea about the oil spill.

01:16:50.898 --> 01:16:54.544
Yeah, thanks. I wasn't, uh, sure
what your plan was, but yeah.

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:58.256
Yeah, I didn't really
have a plan, per se.

01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.699
I mean, it is me,
after all, so...

01:17:04.203 --> 01:17:07.623
I just wanted to do something
selfless for you guys for once.

01:17:08.999 --> 01:17:09.999
Yeah.

01:17:11.127 --> 01:17:13.212
And that's what you bring
to the table, man.

01:17:14.004 --> 01:17:18.509
When we're ready to just lay
down and die, you step up.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:23.490
I would cry if it wasn't such
a bitch-ass thing to do.

01:17:23.514 --> 01:17:24.616
So I'm not going to.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.308
- Don't cry.
- Do not cry.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:28.561
Got this.

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:31.456
But I will let you guys know...

01:17:31.480 --> 01:17:33.291
that I fucking love you, dog.

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:36.902
- I really love you.
- Darren, I fucking love you.

01:17:37.862 --> 01:17:38.863
Count me in.

01:17:41.782 --> 01:17:42.782
What's up?

01:17:43.450 --> 01:17:46.596
- And also with you.
- Take it, just take it.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:50.600
That's fine. I'm okay with you
repressing your emotions for now,

01:17:50.624 --> 01:17:53.502
because I understand the type
of upbringing that you've had.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:57.131
And just know that if we
make it out of here alive,

01:17:57.965 --> 01:17:59.526
I wanna see those upgrades.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.302
I wanna be that dude that...

01:18:02.094 --> 01:18:04.030
that helps you guys
get your ideas made.

01:18:04.054 --> 01:18:06.116
I wanna be the fertilizer.
I am the shit.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.995
And you guys are the little idea seeds
that are gonna be planted within me,

01:18:10.019 --> 01:18:11.454
and we are gonna blossom...

01:18:11.478 --> 01:18:14.249
and make a little
Skintendo flower.

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:20.547
You know what?

01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:22.406
Let's build Skintendo right now.

01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:25.385
Don't know what I said. I
sort of was just talking.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:27.387
Let's do it. Tonight.

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:28.787
But why? For what?

01:18:29.663 --> 01:18:31.391
To kill bad guys.

01:18:31.415 --> 01:18:33.727
- Fuck yes.
- So what do you say?

01:18:33.751 --> 01:18:35.145
Baby Dunc, you ready?

01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:36.169
Sorry.

01:18:37.671 --> 01:18:38.565
Joel.

01:18:38.589 --> 01:18:41.276
- You up for this?
- Yeah.

01:18:41.300 --> 01:18:42.718
I can make it happen.

01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:47.973
And I think I know how. Oh!

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.435
- Just got my baby hairs.
- Sure.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:54.915
How exactly does this
friend-control mode thing work?

01:18:54.939 --> 01:18:58.460
Okay, so you know how the suit can
control the character in the game?

01:18:58.484 --> 01:18:59.461
I do, yeah.

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:02.321
Friend-control mode takes that
concept to another level.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:07.010
But I didn't have any of my material,
so I had to use the electro stim pads

01:19:07.034 --> 01:19:10.096
to control his muscles. Unfortunately,
I ran out of stim pads,

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:12.390
so it can pretty much
just walk and spin.

01:19:12.414 --> 01:19:15.268
Which is why I loaded the fists
full of those lava stones.

01:19:15.292 --> 01:19:18.897
So it's kind of like a, uh,
swinging sledgehammer type thing.

01:19:18.921 --> 01:19:20.005
Nice work, Joel.

01:19:21.548 --> 01:19:23.902
Sledgehammer spin-punching
robo-zombie.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:25.195
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:19:25.219 --> 01:19:28.490
And the air fresheners
are because...

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:30.075
- He shit himself earlier.
- Mm-hm.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:31.451
- So...
- In the spa.

01:19:31.475 --> 01:19:33.475
- Little funky.
- Right, okay. Let's see something.

01:19:33.936 --> 01:19:35.747
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:37.540
Oh, punching. Oh.

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:38.959
- Ooh, shit!
- Nice.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:40.377
- It's good.
- Cool.

01:19:40.401 --> 01:19:41.419
Okay, uh-oh.

01:19:41.443 --> 01:19:43.255
- Give me a shimmy-shimmy.
- We should, uh...

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:44.339
Shake-a-shake-a-shake.

01:19:44.363 --> 01:19:46.049
- Dab it on him. Dab it on him.
- Attack?

01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:48.009
- Alexxx, let's attack, please.
- Wiggle, wiggle.

01:19:48.033 --> 01:19:49.201
Yep, okay, yep.

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:50.845
Nope, nope! No, no, no, no.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.597
- Okay, all right.
- It's just actually...

01:19:52.621 --> 01:19:53.765
no, I'm not ready.

01:19:53.789 --> 01:19:55.149
I have to tell you
guys something,

01:19:55.249 --> 01:19:57.793
and it's been weighing
on me for a long time.

01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.022
- I am...
- A gay guy.

01:20:01.046 --> 01:20:03.733
Yep, we know. Zero to hero, go!

01:20:03.757 --> 01:20:05.217
Just don't have time, sorry.

01:20:08.387 --> 01:20:09.990
Rich, where have you been?

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:11.533
And what...

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:13.225
what are you... what
are you wearing?

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:16.830
Yo. It's the suit.

01:20:16.854 --> 01:20:18.498
Fuck you, bad guys.

01:20:18.522 --> 01:20:20.083
Fuck you, bad guys!

01:20:21.984 --> 01:20:24.320
<i>♪ Gimme fuel, gimme fire

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:31.386

01:20:31.410 --> 01:20:32.578

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.897

01:20:42.921 --> 01:20:45.191
Yeah! Oh, I spun right...
you saw that.

01:20:45.215 --> 01:20:47.360
What do you mean, "we know"?

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:50.554
You've come out to us a hundred times.
It's your drunk thing. Get the guy.

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.870
Yeah, the first time was
prom our senior year,

01:20:56.894 --> 01:20:58.872
and then a bunch of
times in New Orleans.

01:20:58.896 --> 01:21:03.043
Something about Bourbon Street, man.
It brings it out of you, and then...

01:21:03.067 --> 01:21:05.462
Then when we got Osama bin
Laden, we all got really drunk,

01:21:05.486 --> 01:21:07.905
and you wouldn't shut the fuck
up about how gay you were.

01:21:14.244 --> 01:21:16.931
Why didn't you say anything?
This shit weighs heavily on me.

01:21:16.955 --> 01:21:20.018
You've never brought it up sober, so
we were kind of waiting for you to...

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.353
well, do what you're doing now.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:23.605
This is the moment, yeah. I
suppose this is the moment.

01:21:23.629 --> 01:21:25.440
And by the way,
congrats on coming out.

01:21:25.464 --> 01:21:26.983
- This is a big deal.
- Yeah.

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:28.068
- Huge.
- That is huge.

01:21:28.092 --> 01:21:30.653
Hey, look, the Skintendo Joysuit's working.
That's awesome.

01:21:30.677 --> 01:21:32.989
- Damn right.
- Yeah, I'm actually really surprised

01:21:33.013 --> 01:21:34.973
the Dirt Devil batteries
aren't overheating.

01:21:56.829 --> 01:21:58.914
That was fucking dope.

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:01.417
Let's do this.

01:22:04.002 --> 01:22:06.398
Well, let's fuck some shit up.

01:22:06.422 --> 01:22:09.150
Whoa, Joel, suddenly not
scared of everything.

01:22:09.174 --> 01:22:11.403
Yeah. That was when I
was in the closet.

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:13.595
Now I'm the most powerful
thing in the world...

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:17.141
a pissed-off gay dude.

01:22:18.976 --> 01:22:21.079
Stay in the back, because
we have guns and you don't.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:22.539
- Yep.
- Don't need one.

01:22:22.563 --> 01:22:23.623
- Ready?
- Let's do this.

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:26.376
Let's do this! Let's
do this shit!

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.902
Dew'd Crew!

01:22:29.403 --> 01:22:31.363
Bump it, bump it...

01:22:40.998 --> 01:22:43.476
Stop shooting, or he's dead.

01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.771
Yo, butler dude! It's over, man.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.524
I am not a butler!

01:22:49.548 --> 01:22:51.568
Yeah, right, and
we're not waiters.

01:22:51.592 --> 01:22:52.569
We're not.

01:22:52.593 --> 01:22:54.404
- Well, we're waiters.
- We're like... okay.

01:22:54.428 --> 01:22:57.097
Look, cops have the place
surrounded, so drop your guns!

01:22:57.681 --> 01:22:59.868
Good advice.

01:22:59.892 --> 01:23:04.622
Put... your guns... down.

01:23:04.646 --> 01:23:05.689
Erma!

01:23:06.482 --> 01:23:08.793
- What happened to your face?
- Shut up!

01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:09.878
Go get the money.

01:23:09.902 --> 01:23:11.421
Let's go!

01:23:11.445 --> 01:23:14.198
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:23:14.656 --> 01:23:17.635
I do not appreciate the way you've
been trying to kill us tonight.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.721
- I don't think she cares, man.
- Mm.

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:21.556
Erma, have your fun and
get up to the roof.

01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:22.849
Alan, grab what you can.

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:27.687
Oh, shit, your boyfriend's leaving. You
should probably roll with him, right?

01:23:27.711 --> 01:23:30.982
He is not... my boyfriend!

01:23:31.006 --> 01:23:32.567
Okay, you're single.
Cool. What's up?

01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:36.762
I... am a trained
killer on a job.

01:23:37.471 --> 01:23:38.514
And you...

01:23:39.306 --> 01:23:41.099
are in my office.

01:23:44.019 --> 01:23:46.730
Uh, Joel, what are you doing? She's
gonna blow your brains out, man.

01:23:48.941 --> 01:23:53.529
You... need to apologize.

01:23:54.112 --> 01:23:55.112
Okay?

01:23:55.405 --> 01:23:56.740
He's gay now.

01:24:05.999 --> 01:24:07.668
Oh, shit.

01:24:13.131 --> 01:24:16.385
I don't do apologies, faggot.

01:24:16.927 --> 01:24:20.114
Ooh, I know you didn't
just call me the F word!

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:21.908
Joel, you haven't even
fucked a dude yet.

01:24:21.932 --> 01:24:23.660
Yes, I have.

01:24:23.684 --> 01:24:25.644
And in the butt's
better than vagina.

01:24:26.311 --> 01:24:28.623
- Way better.
- Chicks have butts too, though.

01:24:32.317 --> 01:24:35.088
Oh! Whoa, dude, I just
slapped the shit out of her.

01:24:35.112 --> 01:24:37.048
- Yeah, you did.
- That was awesome. Nice, Joel.

01:24:37.072 --> 01:24:38.091
- Look out!
- Watch out!

01:24:38.115 --> 01:24:39.217
Oh!

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:41.660
This ends now!

01:24:44.454 --> 01:24:46.099
- Oh, man!
- Oh, no.

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:50.395
- Get him, Erma!
- Come on, Joel!

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:52.087
Let's go, Joel!

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:54.691
Take that!

01:24:54.715 --> 01:24:56.276
- Yeah!
- Little fucker!

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.218
Yeah, fuck you, bitch!

01:25:00.053 --> 01:25:04.516
You like that? You like picking on
people 'cause they're different?

01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:14.776
No, no! Joel!

01:25:22.868 --> 01:25:24.161
Right in the numbers.

01:25:39.301 --> 01:25:40.862
Yes!

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:42.322
Yes!

01:25:42.346 --> 01:25:44.181
- You get outta here.
- Ha!

01:25:45.807 --> 01:25:47.577
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:25:47.601 --> 01:25:50.455
Baby Dunc with the slam dunk.

01:25:50.479 --> 01:25:53.124
Yes! Tom fucking Brady!

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:54.125
- Not Tom Brady.
- No.

01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:56.085
- He plays football, not basketball.
- Slam dunk.

01:25:56.109 --> 01:25:57.962
If anyone's Tom Brady,
it's my man Mitch.

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:00.089
- We thought you were dead, dude.
- Mitch, your dick.

01:26:00.113 --> 01:26:02.467
Eh, don't worry about it, boys.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.052
We live in Los Angeles.

01:26:04.076 --> 01:26:08.514
Eh, I give it eight weeks before me
and the Swamp Thing get reattached,

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:11.100
or regrown, or whatever the hell
they're gonna do to get us back

01:26:11.124 --> 01:26:13.144
to fuckin' half this
town, am I right, boy?

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:15.355
Is everybody okay? Huh?

01:26:15.379 --> 01:26:17.940
Cassie, huh? You okay?

01:26:17.964 --> 01:26:22.070
Yeah, I-I'm a little shaken, but I feel...
Oh, I feel okay.

01:26:22.094 --> 01:26:25.531
Hey... that promotion is yours.

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:27.200
- Really?
- You earned it.

01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:30.078
- Yes.
- Now put my pecker on ice, huh?

01:26:30.102 --> 01:26:31.287
Wow, what a night, boys.

01:26:31.311 --> 01:26:34.165
I have been crawling around
this hotel for hours.

01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.750
- Ooh.
- You know what, Mitch?

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:37.859
- Huh?
- I have a better idea.

01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:41.673
How's about I call corporate and
tell them what a disgusting

01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:46.284
excuse for a man you are and demand
that you be fired immediately?

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:50.455
No, not because I want
your job or a promotion.

01:26:50.956 --> 01:26:54.936
Because I want you to know
that if you behave like a pig,

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.962
you deserve to get
stuck like one.

01:27:00.841 --> 01:27:04.195
- Wow!
- Sixty-one yards.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:07.490
New Mexico High School
state record, boy or girl.

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:09.742
I'll make it up.

01:27:09.766 --> 01:27:12.519
Let me just get my head together,
and we'll talk about it, all right?

01:27:13.186 --> 01:27:14.414
Hey!

01:27:14.438 --> 01:27:16.999
Somebody get my dick for me there, huh?
A little help?

01:27:20.861 --> 01:27:22.547
- Where's Erma?
- She's gone.

01:27:22.571 --> 01:27:24.090
What, you didn't grab any money?

01:27:24.114 --> 01:27:25.133
No, I just want...

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:27.719
Get this thing in
the air already.

01:27:27.743 --> 01:27:30.888
Okay, but I haven't actually
technically flown this type of...

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:32.557
Alan, helicopter, air, now!

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:34.458
I'm not the one that
shot the pilot!

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.477
- Hey!
- Wait!

01:27:53.977 --> 01:27:57.481
Why are their pockets inside out?
Why are their pockets inside out?!

01:27:58.398 --> 01:28:00.752
We're the waiters from before!

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:02.378
We want to buy the Bey back!

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:05.155
Please, we got all your money, look!
You can have it all!

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:08.634
We just want the Bey!

01:28:08.658 --> 01:28:11.512
If I give you the Bey, they
shoot me out of the sky.

01:28:11.536 --> 01:28:15.141
We brought an empty bag! The
Bey can just climb inside!

01:28:15.165 --> 01:28:16.058
What?

01:28:16.082 --> 01:28:18.978
They'll never know that
he left the helicopter,

01:28:19.002 --> 01:28:20.545
and you get all your money!

01:28:22.672 --> 01:28:23.965
Okay! Hurry!

01:28:26.635 --> 01:28:27.945
Goddamn.

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.614
Get in. Come on.

01:28:29.638 --> 01:28:31.949
Look, I'm saving you, dude.
I'm saving you.

01:28:31.973 --> 01:28:33.058
Shut the fuck up.

01:28:34.643 --> 01:28:36.245
You fucking asshole!

01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:37.789
I will fucking kill you, dog!

01:28:37.813 --> 01:28:40.357
- Don't you fucking close that...
- Let's get him out of here.

01:28:41.358 --> 01:28:43.252
- All right, you got all the money.
- Right.

01:28:43.276 --> 01:28:44.796
Thanks. You're not
gonna regret this.

01:28:44.820 --> 01:28:47.256
Let's make sure of that.

01:28:47.280 --> 01:28:48.490
Oh!

01:28:50.492 --> 01:28:51.493
Jesus.

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:54.955
- Get rid of him.
- Goddamn it.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:58.208
Alan, let's go.

01:29:01.253 --> 01:29:02.337
Open it up!

01:29:05.173 --> 01:29:06.067
Come on, open it.

01:29:06.091 --> 01:29:07.819
He's alive.

01:29:07.843 --> 01:29:09.821
- Oh, my God! Oh, shit!
- Are you okay?

01:29:09.845 --> 01:29:11.656
Fuck, that motherfucker shot me!

01:29:11.680 --> 01:29:14.033
I can't believe he's getting
away with this shit!

01:29:14.057 --> 01:29:16.434
He's not. Watch this shit.

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:18.185
Cassie.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:20.438
Time to let the dogs out.

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:22.583
Over. You gotta say "over."

01:29:22.607 --> 01:29:25.503
Okay, everybody, that's it!
Let's go! Let's go!

01:29:25.527 --> 01:29:26.987
Let's go!

01:29:28.697 --> 01:29:30.007
Faster!

01:29:42.961 --> 01:29:43.961
No.

01:29:45.005 --> 01:29:46.214
No!

01:29:48.925 --> 01:29:50.945
It worked!

01:29:50.969 --> 01:29:52.947
He fucking blew up.

01:29:52.971 --> 01:29:55.741
Yes! Oh, man. It's kind
of fun being badass.

01:29:55.765 --> 01:29:57.952
Yeah, yeah, it is,
uh, pretty exciting.

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.747
- I told you guys.
- You did.

01:30:01.771 --> 01:30:03.982
You did, man. I'm
sorry I doubted you.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:08.546
- Get me to a fucking hospital!
- Yep, okay.

01:30:08.570 --> 01:30:09.570
Dumb fucks!

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:17.722
Okay, so, you know,

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:20.016
we'll start working on the
Skintendo Joysuit right away

01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:21.350
and then keep you in the loop.

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:23.311
Yeah, and we are going
to need another check.

01:30:23.335 --> 01:30:24.228
Yeah.

01:30:24.252 --> 01:30:26.105
Our lives are in a pretty
bad place right now,

01:30:26.129 --> 01:30:28.107
and that check is gonna
change our lives forever.

01:30:28.131 --> 01:30:30.818
Fuck are you talking about? I'm not
writing you guys another check.

01:30:30.842 --> 01:30:32.695
Hold on. Wait one second.

01:30:32.719 --> 01:30:35.281
Why aren't you gonna... Oh,
he's concussed, right?

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:38.034
He's got something up with his brain?
Is it jiggling around in there?

01:30:38.058 --> 01:30:41.579
Bitch, the only reason I wrote
that check was to piss off Ahmad,

01:30:41.603 --> 01:30:45.041
'cause that shit made me laugh.

01:30:46.858 --> 01:30:47.984
Oh, my tummy.

01:30:49.361 --> 01:30:51.005
Get me the fuck up out of here.

01:30:51.029 --> 01:30:52.173
Come on.

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:54.884
And play with my balls. Make
sure my dick still works.

01:30:54.908 --> 01:30:57.762
I do not get that. He seemed like
such a stand-up guy on the Instagram.

01:30:57.786 --> 01:30:59.138
- He's an asshole.
- Piece of shit.

01:30:59.162 --> 01:31:01.599
Excuse me. Hey, guys,
um, I'm Mark Cuban.

01:31:01.623 --> 01:31:03.726
I'm a friend of the Bey's.
I was up there tonight.

01:31:03.750 --> 01:31:06.187
- I saw you guys had that bodysuit thing.
- Yeah.

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:07.313
Holy fuckin' shit!

01:31:07.337 --> 01:31:10.650
Oh, yeah, yup, we're
gettin' Shark Tanked.

01:31:10.674 --> 01:31:13.527
Mark Cuban wants to buy
the Skintendo Joysuit!

01:31:13.551 --> 01:31:15.655
Skintendo Joysuit? That's
what you named it?

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:17.740
- Yeah, I named it.
- Good name, right?

01:31:17.764 --> 01:31:20.409
That's bad. No. I'm
definitely not interested.

01:31:20.433 --> 01:31:25.164
However, what you just went through
tonight was pretty hard-core.

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:28.125
I'd like to buy your story,
turn it into a video game

01:31:28.149 --> 01:31:29.710
starring you guys,

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:33.214
voiced over and visually modeled
after famous actors, of course.

01:31:33.238 --> 01:31:35.216
- I call Sean Astin.
- Mark-Paul Gosselaar, please!

01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:37.677
Uh, Cara Delevingne.
I don't know.

01:31:37.701 --> 01:31:39.178
- Whoever we can get.
- I don't know.

01:31:39.202 --> 01:31:41.389
- All right, guys.
- Awesome. Thank you so much.

01:31:41.413 --> 01:31:42.932
Oh, he even walks cool.
Sick blanket.

01:31:42.956 --> 01:31:44.436
- See you, Marky Cubes.
- Ring-a-ling.

01:31:44.749 --> 01:31:45.851
- Sweet.
- That was awesome!

01:31:45.875 --> 01:31:46.960
That's funny. Wow.

01:32:02.642 --> 01:32:04.995
Announcement! Announcement!
Shut... shut up.

01:32:05.019 --> 01:32:07.206
Shut up real quick. I'm
gonna make an announcement.

01:32:07.230 --> 01:32:08.791
Hey, look. Now, I know

01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:13.629
we are the millionaire video game mavens
that chartered this Costa Rica cruise

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:15.881
for 100 of our closest
friends, yes,

01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:19.385
but I wanna congratulate
you guys for having...

01:32:19.409 --> 01:32:22.346
the best butt-cheeks
in the business!

01:32:22.370 --> 01:32:23.597
You guys are hot as fuck.

01:32:23.621 --> 01:32:25.850
And shake 'em if you got 'em!

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:27.643
Whoa!

01:32:29.335 --> 01:32:31.480
Dinner bell's ringing.
Come and get it, boys.

01:32:31.504 --> 01:32:35.884
- Come and get it, huh?
- Joel, I am so proud of you, dude.

01:32:36.301 --> 01:32:37.862
Not a day goes by that I miss

01:32:37.886 --> 01:32:41.264
that shy, closeted bitch that
you once were, and I mean that.

01:32:41.681 --> 01:32:43.576
- Thanks, man.
- And Darren?

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:46.162
I am beyond thrilled that you are
no longer a controlling asshole

01:32:46.186 --> 01:32:49.206
who needs to smoke
salvia just to get by.

01:32:49.230 --> 01:32:51.125
Haven't touched the
stuff since that night.

01:32:51.149 --> 01:32:52.585
- Good.
- You know that.

01:32:52.609 --> 01:32:54.295
Yeah.

01:32:54.319 --> 01:32:57.256
Just, uh, doing cocaine now, you know.
But for fun.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.883
It's better for you.

01:32:58.907 --> 01:33:01.427
Ah! This is the best, guys.

01:33:01.451 --> 01:33:04.013
Look at us. Rich beyond
our wildest dreams.

01:33:04.037 --> 01:33:06.265
- Darren doing cocaine for fun.
- Shh.

01:33:06.289 --> 01:33:09.351
Joel is, like, fricking wiggling his
dick around, just begging for cock.

01:33:09.375 --> 01:33:11.645
Hey, I'm not... I'm
not begging yet.

01:33:12.670 --> 01:33:15.649
Oh! Darren, tell Alexxx
about that video game idea.

01:33:15.673 --> 01:33:17.526
Oh, yeah. Okay.

01:33:17.550 --> 01:33:18.802
New idea, new game:

01:33:19.302 --> 01:33:22.055
leprechauns... but they're tall.

01:33:22.931 --> 01:33:24.808
Oh, that is a clever twist.

01:33:26.184 --> 01:33:29.789
No. Nope. I'm not all about
making money anymore.

01:33:29.813 --> 01:33:32.398
You know what I'm about?
Best friends.

01:33:33.566 --> 01:33:34.734
Put your hands in.

01:33:36.528 --> 01:33:39.006
Dew'd Crew!

01:33:39.030 --> 01:33:41.050
Booty bump, a-booty bump!

01:33:41.074 --> 01:33:43.385
Yes! We're gonna live forever!

01:33:43.409 --> 01:33:45.179
