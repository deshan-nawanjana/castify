00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.370
<i>Fear.
Treachery. Bloodlust.</i>

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.409
<i>Thousands of years ago...</i>

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.808
<i>these were the forces
that ruled our world.</i>

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.970
<i>A world where prey
were scared of predators.</i>

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.569
<i>And predators had an uncontrollable...</i>

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.210
<i>biological urge...</i>

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.886
<i>to maim, and maul, and...</i>

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.527
Blood! Blood! Blood!

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.728
And death.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.766
Back then, the world was divided in two.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.684
Vicious predator...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.525
or meek prey.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.001
But over time,
we evolved.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.807
And moved beyond
our primitive, savage ways.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.402
Now, predator and prey live in harmony.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.844
And every young mammal has
multitudinous opportunities.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.921
Yeah.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.523
I don't have to cower in a herd anymore.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.247
Instead, I can be an astronaut.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.443
I don't have to be
a lonely hunter anymore.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.967
Today, I can hunt for tax exemptions.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.965
I'm gonna be an actuary!

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.284
And I can make the world a better place.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.090
I am going to be...

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.963
a police officer!

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.800
Bunny cop?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.651
That is the most
stupidest thing I ever heard.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.565
It may seem impossible
to small minds...

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.040
I'm looking at you, Gideon Grey.

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.405
But, just 211 miles away...

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.127
stands the great city of Zootopia!

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.643
Where our ancestors first
joined together in peace...

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.206
and declared that anyone
can be anything!

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.081
Thank you and good night!

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.440
Judy, you ever wonder
how your mom and me...

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.210
got to be so darn happy?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.361
Nope.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.211
Well, we gave up on our dreams
and we settled. Right, Bon?

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.562
Oh, yes, that's right, Stu.
We settled hard.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.610
See, that's the beauty
of complacency, Jude.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.041
If you don't try anything new,
you'll never fail.

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:28.651
I like trying actually.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.245
What you father means, hon...

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.925
is it's gonna be difficult...

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.401
impossible even, for you
to become a police officer.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.045
Right. There's never been a bunny cop.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.280
- No.
- Bunnies don't do that.

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.321
- Never.
- Never.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.331
Oh. Then, I guess
I'll have to be the first one.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.449
Because I am gonna make...

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.126
the world a better place.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.681
Or, uh, heck,
you know, you want to talk...

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.126
about making the world
a better place...

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.089
no better way to do it than
becoming a carrot farmer.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.123
Yes! Your dad, me...

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.567
your 275 brothers and sisters.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.370
- We're changing the world!
- Yeah.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.523
- One carrot at a time.
- Amen to that.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.160
Carrot farming is a noble profession.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.201
Mmm-hmm.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.800
Just putting the seeds
in the ground.

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.604
Ah, at one with the soil.
Just getting covered in dirt.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.000
You get it, honey.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.360
It's great to have dreams.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.920
Yeah. Just as long as you don't...

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.405
believe in them too much.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.206
Where'd the heck she go?

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.120
Give me
your tickets right now...

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.531
or I'm gonna kick your...

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:21.085
- meek little sheep butt.
- Ow!

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.645
Cut it out, Gideon!

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.201
Baa! Baa!
What are you gonna do? Cry?

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.290
Hey! You heard her. Cut it out.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.369
Nice costume, loser.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.523
What crazy world are you living in...

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.927
where you think
a bunny could be a cop?

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.162
Kindly return my friend's tickets.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.481
Come and get them.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.483
But watch out, because I'm a fox...

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.688
and like you said in your
dumb little stage play...

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.201
us predators used to eat prey.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.681
And that killer instinct
is still in our "Dunnah."

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:49.968
Uh, I'm pretty much sure
it's pronounced "DNA."

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.605
Don't tell me what I know, Travis.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.763
You don't scare me, Gideon.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.608
You scared now?

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.807
Look at
her nose twitch!

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:58.960
She is scared!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.445
Cry little baby bunny.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.681
Cry, Cry...

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.482
Oh, you don't know
when to quit, do you?

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.444
I want you to remember this moment...

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.560
the next time you think...

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.201
you will ever be anything more
than just a stupid...

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.091
carrot-farming, dumb bunny.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.681
That looks bad.

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.370
Are you okay, Judy?

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.648
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:34.607
- Here you go.
- Oh!

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.449
Wow! You got our tickets!

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:37.966
You're awesome, Judy!

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.522
Yeah, that Gideon Grey doesn't
know what he's talking about.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.802
Well, he was right about one thing.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.688
I don't know when to quit.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.207
Listen up, cadets.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.930
Zootopia has 12 unique...

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.401
ecosystems within its city limits.

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.687
Tundratown...

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.921
Sahara Square...

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.924
Rainforest District, to name a few.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.328
You're gonna have
to master all of them...

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.767
before you hit the streets,
or guess what?

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.849
You'll be dead!

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.929
Scorching sandstorm!

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:14.605
You're dead, Bunny Bumpkin!

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.241
1,000-foot fall!

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.606
Whoa!

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.484
You're dead, Carrot Face!

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.928
Frigid ice wall!

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:24.605
Whoop!

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.360
You're dead, Farm Girl!

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.205
Enormous criminal.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.084
You're dead. Dead, dead, dead!

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:38.846
Whoa...

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:40.645
Filthy toilet!

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.325
You're dead, Fluff Butt.

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:45.167
<i>Just quit and go home, fuzzy bunny!</i>

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.600
<i>There's never been
a bunny cop.</i>

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.761
<i>- Never.
- Never.</i>

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:50.446
<i>Just a stupid,
carrot-farming dumb bunny.</i>

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.490
<i>As mayor of Zootopia,
I am proud to announce...</i>

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.929
<i>that my Mammal inclusion
initiative has produced...</i>

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.731
<i>its first police academy graduate.</i>

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.650
<i>Valedictorian of her class...</i>

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.242
<i>ZPD's very first rabbit officer...</i>

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.482
<i>Judy Hopps.</i>

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.051
Oh, gosh.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.200
<i>Assistant Mayor Bellwether, her badge.</i>

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.731
<i>- Oh, yes. Right!
- Thank you.</i>

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:43.280
Yay, Judy!

00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:44.680
<i>Judy...</i>

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.367
<i>it is my great privilege
to officially assign you...</i>

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:50.050
<i>to the heart of Zootopia:</i>

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.765
<i>Precinct One.</i>

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.923
<i>City Center</i>

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:56.689
Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.690
I won't let you down.

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:00.529
This has been my dream
since I was a kid.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.248
It's a real proud day for us little guys.

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.080
Bellwether, make room,
will you? Come on.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.447
Okay, Officer Hopps.
Let's see those teeth!

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.364
- Officer Hopps, right here!
- Look this way please!

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.080
Hold still. Smile!

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.726
We're real
proud of you, Judy.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.365
Yeah. Scared, too.

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:17.726
- Yes.
- Really, it's kind of...

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.887
a proud-scared combo.

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.487
I mean, Zootopia. So far away.
Such a big city.

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.607
Guys...

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.729
I've been working for this my whole life.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.967
We know. And we're just...

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.248
a little excited for you, but terrified.

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.041
The only thing we have
to fear is fear itself.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.721
And also bears.
We have bears to fear, too.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.246
Say nothing of lions and wolves.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.481
- Wolves?
- Weasels.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:38.801
You play cribbage with a weasel.

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:39.961
Yeah. And he cheats
like there's no tomorrow.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.161
You know what, pretty much...

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.084
all predators.
And Zootopia's full of them.

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.241
Oh, Stu.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.731
And foxes are the worst.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.571
Actually, your father does
have a point there.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:50.011
It's in their biology.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.446
Remember what happened
with Gideon Grey?

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.091
When I was nine.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:56.250
Gideon Grey was a jerk
who happened to be a fox.

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.289
I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks.

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.171
Sure, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case...

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.401
we made you a little care...

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.567
- package to take with you.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.880
And I put some snacks in there.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.880
- This is fox deterrent.
- Yeah, that's safe...

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.081
- to have that. Okay.
- This is fox repellent.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.201
The deterrent and the repellent...

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.361
- that's all she needs.
- Check this out!

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.760
Oh, for goodness sake.

00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:13.524
She has no need for a fox Taser, Stu.

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:15.967
Oh, come on. When is there not
a need for a fox Taser?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.766
Okay, look! I will take this,
to make you stop talking.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:20.720
Terrific! Everyone wins!

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:23.446
<i>Arriving, Zootopia Express.</i>

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.047
Okay, gotta go! Bye!

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:29.761
Bye, Judy!

00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:31.211
Bye, Judy!

00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.281
Mmm.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:38.050
I love you guys.

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:40.689
Love you, too.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:43.162
Oh, cripes, here come
the waterworks.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:44.560
Oh, Stu, pull it together.

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.281
Bye, everybody!

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.686
- Bye-bye, Judy!
- Bye, Judy!

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.490
I love you!

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.883
Bye! Bye!

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Goodbye!

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:12.081
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.167
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.571
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:24.362
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.130
<i>I messed up tonight
I lost another fight</i>

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:32.967
<i>Lost to myself
But I'll just start again</i>

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.282
<i>I keep falling down</i>

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.562
<i>I keep on hitting the ground</i>

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.290
<i>But I always get up now</i>

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.402
<i>To see what's next</i>

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:45.642
<i>Birds don't just fly</i>

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.722
<i>They fall down and get up</i>

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:57.850
<i>Nobody learns
without getting it wrong</i>

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.929
<i>I won't give up
No I won't give in</i>

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:06.086
<i>Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again</i>

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.202
<i>No I won't leave</i>

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.648
<i>I want to try everything</i>

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.004
<i>I want to try
even though I could fail</i>

00:11:15.200 --> 00:11:18.568
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.768
<i>Till I reach the end</i>

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:22.803
<i>Then I'll start again</i>

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.369
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:31.121
<i>I want to try
even though I could fail</i>

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.962
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.441
<i>Try everything</i>

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:39.048
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:40.885
<i>Try everything</i>

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.362
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.450
<i>Try everything</i>

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.761
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:56.245
<i>I'll keep on making those new mistakes</i>

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:04.205
<i>I'll keep on making them every day</i>

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.161
<i>Those new mistakes</i>

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.604
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:24.890
<i>Try everything</i>

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.371
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.090
<i>Try everything</i>

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.208
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.169
<i>Try everything</i>

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.481
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.365
<i>Try everything</i>

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:45.761
<i>I'm Gazelle. Welcome to Zootopia.</i>

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.361
Welcome to the Grand Pangolin Arms.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.331
Luxury apartments with charm.

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.000
Complimentary delousing
once a month.

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.241
Don't lose your key.

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.646
Thank you.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.928
Oh, hi! I'm Judy, your new neighbor.

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.207
Yeah? Well, we're loud.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:02.362
Don't expect us to apologize for it.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.527
Greasy walls.

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.926
Hey, shut up!

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.241
Rickety bed.

00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:10.440
- You shut up!
- You shut up!

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.806
Will you shut up?

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.047
Crazy neighbors.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.281
I said, "Shut up!"

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.760
I love it!

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.200
Shut your mouth,
shut up.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.600
Shut up!

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.961
Ah...

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.361
Come on!

00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.329
He bared his teeth first!

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm!

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.920
Excuse me.

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:43.486
Down here.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:44.881
Hi.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.008
O-M-Goodness!

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.124
They really did hire a bunny!
What!

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.725
I gotta tell you, you are even cuter...

00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:53.166
than I thought you'd be!

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.607
Oh, ah. You probably didn't know...

00:13:55.720 --> 00:13:58.564
but a bunny can call
another bunny "cute"...

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.211
but when other animals do it...

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.250
it's a little...

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:06.167
I am so sorry!
Me, Benjamin Clawhauser...

00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:08.084
the guy everyone thinks
is just a flabby...

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:11.244
donut-loving cop,
stereotyping you. Oh...

00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:13.402
No, it's okay. Oh, you've actually got...

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:15.164
- There's a...
- Um... A what?

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.686
In your neck. The fold.

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.564
- Where? Oh!
- The... Mmm-hmm. Yes.

00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.610
There you went,
you little dickens! Mmm.

00:14:22.920 --> 00:14:24.729
I should get to roll call,
which way do I...?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.480
Oh, Bullpen's over there to the left.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:29.160
- Great. Thank you.
- Aw...

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.360
That poor little bunny's
gonna get eaten alive.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:45.769
Hey, Officer Hopps.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.764
You ready to make the world
a better place?

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.400
Atten-hut!

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.929
Hut! Hut! Hut!

00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.124
All right. All right! Everybody sit.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:04.531
I've got three items on the docket.

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.525
First... we need to acknowledge...

00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:09.409
the elephant in the room.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:11.081
Francine...

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.201
Happy birthday.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.611
Oh, yeah.

00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:16.366
Oh. Oh.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.441
Number two.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.564
There are some new recruits
with us I should introduce...

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.800
but I'm not going to...

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.689
because I don't care.

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.566
Finally, we have 14
missing mammal cases.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.167
All predators, from a giant polar bear...

00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.651
to a teensy little otter.

00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:37.845
And City Hall is right up
my tail to find them.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:41.283
This is priority number one.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.606
Assignments.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:44.001
Officers Grizzoli...

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.401
Fangmeyer, Delgato.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.641
Your teams take missing mammals...

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.604
from the Rainforest District.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.891
Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard.

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.407
Your teams take Sahara Square.

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:56.683
Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby.

00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:58.843
Tundratown.

00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:01.845
And finally, our first bunny...

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.560
Officer Hopps.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.361
Parking Duty.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.126
Dismissed.

00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:10.004
Parking duty?

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.361
- Chief!
- Hmm.

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.480
Chief Bogo?

00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.287
Sir, you said there were
14 missing mammal cases.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.090
- So?
- So, I can handle one.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.446
You probably forgot...

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:23.682
but I was top of my class
at the Academy.

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.361
Didn't forget. Just don't care.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.562
Sir, I'm not just some token bunny.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.046
Well, then writing 100 tickets a day...

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.571
should be easy.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.445
100 tickets. I'm not gonna
write 100 tickets.

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:40.722
I'm gonna write 200 tickets.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.041
Before noon.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:40.927
Boom!

00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.043
200 tickets before noon!

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:46.520
Oh...

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:49.200
201.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:53.486
Hey, watch where you're going, fox!

00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.167
Mmm.

00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:22.324
Where'd he go?

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.566
Listen, I don't know what
you're doing skulking...

00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.000
around during daylight hours...

00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:43.368
but I don't want any trouble in here.

00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:45.329
So, hit the road.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.369
I'm not looking for
any trouble either, sir.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:50.370
I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop...

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:52.051
for my little boy.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.847
You want the red or the blue, pal?

00:19:01.600 --> 00:19:02.681
Aw...

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.445
I'm such a...

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:06.767
Oh, come on, kid. Back up.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:07.887
Listen, buddy. What?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.126
There aren't any fox ice cream joints...

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.521
in your part of town?

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:11.760
Uh, no, no. There are.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.561
There are. It's just, my boy,
this goofy little stinker...

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.046
he loves all things elephant.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.690
Wants to be one when he grows up.

00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:20.804
Is that adorable?

00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:22.201
Oh!

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.563
Who the heck am I to crush
his little dreams, huh? Right?

00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.368
Look, you probably can't read, fox...

00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:28.561
but the sign says...

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:31.764
"We reserve the right
to refuse service...

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.207
"...to anyone." So, beat it.

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:36.403
You're holding up the line.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.122
Hello? Excuse me.

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:42.527
Hey, you're gonna have
to wait your turn...

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:44.244
like everyone else, meter maid.

00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:46.369
Actually, I'm an officer.

00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:47.925
Just had a quick question.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.884
Are your customers aware...

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.445
they're getting snot and mucus...

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.840
with their cookies and cream?

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.966
What are you talking about?

00:19:56.200 --> 00:19:58.362
Well, I don't want to
cause you any trouble...

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.606
but I believe scooping ice cream...

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.120
with an ungloved trunk is a Class 3...

00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.441
health code violation.

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.242
Which is kind of a big deal.

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.360
Of course, I could let you off
with a warning...

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:12.086
if you were to glove those
trunks and, I don't know...

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:15.608
finish selling this nice dad
and his son a...

00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:16.841
What was it?

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.962
A Jumbo Pop. Please.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.964
A Jumbo Pop.

00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:23.881
$15.

00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.129
Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.483
Oh, no. Are you kidding me?
I don't have my wallet.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.324
I'd lose my head if it weren't
attached to my neck.

00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:35.606
That's the truth.

00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:37.569
Oh, boy. I'm sorry, pal.

00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.444
Got to be about the worst birthday ever.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.768
Please don't be mad at me.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:43.606
Thanks anyway.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.125
Keep the change.

00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:53.283
Officer, I can't
thank you enough.

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:56.171
So kind, really. Can I pay you back?

00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:58.807
Oh, no, my treat. It just...

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.690
You know, it burns me up
to see folks...

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:02.968
with such backward attitudes
toward foxes.

00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:05.925
I just wanna say you're
a great dad and just a...

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.970
a real articulate fella.

00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:10.844
Oh, well, that is high praise.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:13.611
It's rare that I find someone
so non-patronizing.

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:14.880
Officer...

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.086
Hopps. Mister...

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.447
Wilde. Nick Wilde.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:20.005
And you, little guy...

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.004
You want to be an elephant
when you grow up?

00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.366
You be an elephant.

00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:25.648
Because this is Zootopia.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:29.043
Anyone can be anything.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.040
Oh, boy, I tell him that all the time.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:34.004
All right, here you go. Two paws. Yeah.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.526
Oh, look at that smile.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.170
That's a "happy birthday" smile.

00:21:37.400 --> 00:21:39.687
All right, give her a little
bye-bye toot-toot.

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:42.206
Toot-toot!

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480
Bye, now.

00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:44.600
Goodbye!

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:00.847
Oh!

00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.884
Hey, little Toot-Toot...

00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.087
Popsicles!

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:53.406
Get your popsicles!

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.081
Oh.

00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.841
Lumber delivery.

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:21.041
What's with the color?

00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:22.201
The color?

00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:24.044
Uh, that's red wood.

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.568
39, 40. There you go.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:30.609
Way to work that diaper, big guy.

00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.726
Hey, no kiss bye-bye for daddy?

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.965
You kiss me tomorrow,

00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:38.121
I'll bite your face off.

00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.921
<i>Ciao.</i>

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:47.249
Well. I stood up for you,
and you lied to me.

00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.641
You liar!

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.490
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:52.648
And I'm not the liar. He is.

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.281
Hey!

00:23:57.480 --> 00:24:00.245
All right, slick Nick,
you're under arrest.

00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.766
Really? For what?

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.321
Gee, I don't know. How about
selling food without a permit.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.680
Transporting undeclared
commerce across borough lines.

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:07.841
False advertising.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.811
Permit. Receipt of declared commerce.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.321
And I didn't falsely advertise
anything. Take care.

00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.682
You told that mouse the
Popsicle sticks were redwood!

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.281
That's right. "Red wood ."
With a space in the middle.

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.811
Wood that is red.

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.601
You can't touch me, Carrots.

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.240
I've been doing this since I was born.

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:26.084
You're gonna want to refrain
from calling me Carrots.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.840
My bad. I just naturally assumed...

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:30.042
you came from some little
carrot-choked Podunk, no?

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.160
Uh, no!

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:32.446
Podunk is in Deerbrooke County...

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.720
and I grew up in Bunnyburrow.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.287
Okay. Tell me if this story
sounds familiar.

00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.807
Naive little hick with
good grades and big ideas...

00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.691
decides, "Hey, look at me!
I'm gonna move to Zootopia...

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:44.644
where predators
and prey live in harmony...

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:45.847
and sing 'Kumbaya. "'

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.969
Only to find, whoopsie...

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.565
we don't all get along.

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.364
And that dream of becoming
a big city cop?

00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:53.562
Double whoopsie. She's a meter maid.

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.080
And, whoopsie number three-sie...

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:57.248
no one cares about her or her dreams.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.369
And soon enough, those dreams die...

00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.925
and our bunny sinks into emotional...

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.120
and literal squalor living
in a box under a bridge...

00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.527
till finally she has no choice
but to go back home...

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:08.087
with that cute, fuzzy-wuzzy
little tail between...

00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360
her legs to become...

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:10.965
You're from Bunnyburrow,
is that what you said?

00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:14.044
So how about a carrot farmer.
That sound about right?

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.929
Oh!

00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:19.720
Be careful, now,
or it won't just...

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.171
be your dreams getting crushed.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:25.564
Hey! Hey! No one tells me
what I can or can't be!

00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:27.728
Especially not some jerk...

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.849
who never had the guts to try to be...

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.406
anything more than a Popsicle hustler.

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.002
All right, look.
Everyone comes to Zootopia...

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:38.004
thinking they can be anything they want.

00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.605
Well, you can't.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.882
You can only be what you are.

00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.321
Sly fox, dumb bunny.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.329
I'm not a dumb bunny.

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.811
Right. And that's not wet cement.

00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.720
You'll never be a real cop.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.320
You're a cute meter maid, though.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.644
Maybe a supervisor one day.

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.803
Hang in there.

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:17.568
<i>Everybody hurts</i>

00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:21.327
<i>By myself</i>

00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.807
<i>You can't do nothing right babe</i>

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.923
<i>I'm a loser</i>

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.163
Oh, hey, it's my parents.

00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:56.806
<i>Oh, there she is! Hi, sweetheart!</i>

00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.086
<i>Hey there, Jude the dude.</i>

00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.804
<i>How was your first day on the force?</i>

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:01.723
<i>- It was real great.
- Yeah?</i>

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.200
<i>Everything you ever hoped?</i>

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.680
Mmm. Absolutely.

00:27:04.880 --> 00:27:06.325
And more.

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:09.126
Everyone's so nice
and I feel like I'm really...

00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:10.845
<i>- making a difference.
- Wait a second.</i>

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.400
<i>Holy cripes, Bonnie, look at that.</i>

00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.925
<i>Oh, my sweet heaven!</i>

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.128
<i>Judy. are you a meter maid?</i>

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.601
Oh, this? No! Oh, no. This is
just a temporary thing.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.320
<i>Oh, it's the safest job on the force!</i>

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:21.686
<i>Oh, she's not a real cop.</i>

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:22.887
<i>Our prayers have been answered!</i>

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.126
<i>Glorious day!</i>

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.321
<i>Oh, meter maid! Meter maid!</i>

00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:28.171
<i>- Meter maid! Meter maid!
- Dad. Dad. Dad!</i>

00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.200
It's been a really long day.
I should really...

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:31.361
<i>That's right you get some rest.</i>

00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:32.760
<i>Those meters aren't gonna
maid themselves.</i>

00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.326
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:36.650
Buh-bye.

00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:42.891
Hey, buddy, turn down
that depressing music.

00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.680
Leave
the meter maid alone.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:47.171
Didn't you hear her conversation?

00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.441
She feels like a failure!

00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.320
- Oh, shut up!
- You shut up!

00:27:50.360 --> 00:27:51.361
You shut up!

00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:52.607
You shut up!

00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:54.569
Tomorrow's another day.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.967
Yeah,
but it might be worse!

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.411
I was 30 seconds over!

00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:04.968
Ugh! Yeah, you're a real hero, lady!

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.841
My mommy says she wishes
you were dead.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:10.767
Uncool, rabbit.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:13.047
My tax dollars pay your salary.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.524
I am a real cop. I am
a real cop. I am a real cop.

00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:21.291
Hey, hey, hey! You, bunny!

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.329
Sir. If you have a grievance,

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.329
you may contest your citation
in traffic court.

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.369
What are you talking about? My shop!

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.329
- It was just robbed! Look!
- Oh!

00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.965
He's getting away!

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.611
Are you a cop or not?

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.531
Oh, yes! Yes! Don't worry, sir!
I've got this!

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:40.761
- Stop!
- Huh?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:42.040
Stop, in the name of the law!

00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:44.801
Catch me if you can, Cottontail!

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:50.923
Whoa! Whoa!

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.326
Whoa.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.521
Coming through!

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.250
This is Officer McHorn, we got a 10-31.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.487
I got dibs!

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.165
Officer Hopps. I am in pursuit!

00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.125
Whoo-whoo!

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.846
Whoa!

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.600
Ha!

00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.450
You!

00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:17.600
Freeze!

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.802
Hey, meter maid! Wait for the real cops!

00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.121
Stop!

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.120
Oh...

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.041
Oh!

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Sorry. Coming through.

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:53.367
Excuse me. Excuse me. Pardon.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.201
Bon voyage-e, flat foot!

00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:09.041
Huh?

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.730
Ha! Oh...

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.291
Hey, stop right there!

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.806
Have a donut, copper!

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.962
Oh, my God. Did you see
those leopard print jeggings?

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.200
Oh!

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:32.605
I love your hair.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.161
Thank you.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.408
Come to papa.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.166
Okay. You're gonna
have to be patient...

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.646
and wait in line
just like everyone else...

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.928
Mrs. Otterton. Okay?

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.722
I popped the weasel!

00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.604
Hopps!

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.210
Abandoning your post.

00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.770
Inciting a scurry.

00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:02.883
Reckless endangerment of rodents.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:04.923
But, to be fair...

00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:06.480
you did stop a master criminal...

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:08.608
from stealing two dozen moldy onions.

00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:10.567
Mmm. Hate to disagree with you, sir...

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:11.886
but those aren't onions.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.320
Those are a crocus varietal...

00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.731
<i>called midnicampum holicithias.</i>

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.280
They're a Class-C botanical, sir.

00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:17.401
Well, I grew up in a family...

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.681
where plant husbandry
was kind of a thing.

00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.649
Shut your tiny mouth now!

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.289
Sir, I got the bad guy.

00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.561
That's my job.

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.524
Your job is putting tickets...

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.000
on parked cars!

00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:29.041
<i>Chief...</i>

00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:30.880
<i>uh, Mrs. Otterton's here
to see you again.</i>

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.251
<i>- Not now.
- Okay, I just didn't know . .</i>

00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:33.367
<i>If you'd want to take it this time.</i>

00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:34.521
<i>She seems really upset.</i>

00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.840
- Not now!
- Sir...

00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.724
I don't want to be a meter maid...

00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.962
I want to be a real cop.

00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:43.289
Do you think the mayor asked
what I wanted...

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.042
when he assigned you to me?

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:46.246
But, sir, if...

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:47.720
Life isn't some cartoon musical...

00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:49.131
where you sing a little song...

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:52.688
and your insipid dreams
magically come true.

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:56.288
So, let it go.

00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:57.970
Chief Bogo, please.

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:59.724
Five minutes of your time. Please.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.960
I'm sorry, sir.

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.202
I tried to stop her.
She is super-slippery.

00:32:03.480 --> 00:32:05.005
I gotta go sit down.

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:08.529
Ma'am, as I've told you,
we're doing everything we can.

00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:11.081
My husband has been missing
for 10 days.

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.566
His name is Emmitt Otterton.

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.800
Yes, I know.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.888
He's a florist.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.525
We have two beautiful children.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.324
He would never just disappear.

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.445
Ma'am, our detectives
are very busy.

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:23.687
Please.

00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.604
There's got to be somebody
to find my Emmitt.

00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:27.887
Mrs. Otterton...

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:28.960
I will find him.

00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:30.560
Oh!

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.090
Thank you.

00:32:32.480 --> 00:32:33.527
- Bless you.
- Oh!

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.284
Bless you, little bunny.

00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:37.727
Oh.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.081
Take this.

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.527
Find my Emmitt. Bring him home...

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.643
to me and my babies, please.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.166
Mrs. Otterton, please wait out here.

00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.000
Of course. Oh, thank you both so much.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.520
One second.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.684
You're fired.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.006
What? Why?

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.480
Insubordination!

00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.330
Now. I'm going to open this door...

00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:58.885
and you're going to tell that otter...

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.331
you're a former meter maid...

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:02.528
with delusions of grandeur...

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.449
who will not be taking the case!

00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:07.490
I just heard Officer Hopps
is taking the case.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.006
Assistant Mayor Bellwether.

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.560
The Mammal Inclusion Initiative...

00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:12.523
is really starting to pay off.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.280
Mayor Lionheart is just gonna
be so jazzed!

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.521
No, no, let's not tell
the Mayor just yet.

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.491
And I've sent it and it is
done, so I did do that.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:21.720
All right. Well, I'd say
the case is in good hands.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:24.001
Us little guys really need to
stick together, right?

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:25.481
Like glue.

00:33:25.720 --> 00:33:27.006
Good one.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:29.123
Just call me if you ever
need anything, okay?

00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.240
You've always got a friend
at City Hall, Judy.

00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.651
All right, bye-bye.

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.882
Thank you, ma'am.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.880
I will give you 48 hours.

00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.207
Yes!

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.561
That's two days to find Emmitt Otterton.

00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.721
Okay.

00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.930
But, you strike out, you resign.

00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:52.082
Oh! Uh...

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.161
Okay.

00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:56.281
Deal!

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.400
Splendid.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:34:00.091
Clawhauser will give you
the complete case file.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.480
Here you go.

00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.085
One missing otter.

00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.841
That's it?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.004
Yikes! That is the smallest
case file I've ever seen.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.402
Leads, none.
Witnesses, none.

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:13.090
And you're not
in the computer system yet...

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.442
so resources, none!

00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.091
Oh, I hope you didn't stake
your career...

00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.930
on cracking this one!

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.248
Okay.
Last known sighting.

00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:28.967
Can I just borrow... Thank you.

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.047
Popsicle?

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.805
The murder weapon.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.451
Get your Popsicle.

00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:40.281
Yeah. Because that...
What does that mean?

00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:41.521
It means...

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.721
I have a lead.

00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.766
Hi! Hello? It's me, again!

00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:55.964
Hey, it's Officer Toot-Toot.

00:34:56.120 --> 00:34:57.963
No. Actually, it's Officer Hopps...

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.200
and I'm here to ask you
some questions about a case.

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:01.401
What happened, meter maid?

00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.840
Did someone steal a traffic cone?

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.610
It wasn't me.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.005
Hey, Carrots, you're going
to wake the baby.

00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.161
I gotta get to work.

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.487
This is important, sir.

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:14.849
I think your $10 worth
of popsicles can wait.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.129
I make
200 bucks a day, Fluff!

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:21.483
365 days a year, since I was 12.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:23.250
And time is money. Hop along.

00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.244
Please, just look at the picture.

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.811
You sold Mr. Otterton
that Popsicle, right?

00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:27.967
Do you know him?

00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.161
I know everybody.

00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.603
And I also know that, somewhere...

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.966
there's a toy store missing
its stuffed animal...

00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.765
so why don't you get back to your box?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.800
Fine. Then we'll have
to do this the hard way.

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:41.010
Did you just boot my stroller?

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.009
Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:45.840
Ha! For what?
Hurting your feelings?

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.206
Felony Tax Evasion.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.686
Yeah, $200 a day, 365 days a year...

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.046
since you were 12.

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.203
That's two decades, so times 20...

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.966
which is $ 1,460, 000, I think.

00:35:58.200 --> 00:36:00.282
I mean,
I am just a dumb bunny...

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:01.731
but we are good at multiplying.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.649
Anyway, according to your tax forms...

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.486
you reported, let me see here... zero!

00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:09.371
Unfortunately, lying on a federal form...

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.891
is a punishable offense.

00:36:11.240 --> 00:36:12.526
Five years jail time.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.882
Well, it's my word against yours.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.649
<i>200 bucks a day, Fluff!</i>

00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:20.565
<i>365 days a year, since I was 12.</i>

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.484
Actually, it's your word against yours.

00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.484
And if you want this pen,
you're going to help me...

00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.011
find this poor, missing otter...

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.969
or the only place you'll be
selling popsicles...

00:36:28.120 --> 00:36:30.168
is the prison cafeteria.

00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:33.083
It's called a hustle, sweetheart.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.363
She hustled you.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:42.051
She hustled you good!

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.369
You a cop now, Nick.
You gonna need one of these.

00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:47.687
Have fun...

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:48.926
working with the fuzz!

00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:52.611
Start talking.

00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.246
I don't know where he is.

00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:56.566
I only saw where he went.

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:57.761
Great. Let's go.

00:36:59.160 --> 00:37:01.003
It's not exactly a place for, uh...

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.441
a cute little bunny.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:04.404
Don't call me cute. Get in the car.

00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:06.841
Okay. You're the boss.

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.486
Om!

00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.851
Hi.

00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.120
Hello?

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:29.605
Om!

00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.291
Um, hello?

00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:33.523
Hello? Hello?

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.520
Hmm?

00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:38.160
- Hello. My name is...
- Oh...

00:37:38.240 --> 00:37:39.480
You know, I'm going to hit...

00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:41.489
the pause button right there...

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:43.842
because we're all good
on Bunny Scout cookies.

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.889
Uh... no.

00:37:46.120 --> 00:37:48.327
I'm Officer Hopps, ZPD.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:50.722
I'm looking for a missing mammal...

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:52.245
Emmitt Otterton, right here...

00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:55.006
who may have frequented
this establishment.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:37:59.647
Hmm.

00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:02.326
Yeah, old Emmitt.

00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:04.847
Haven't seen him in a couple of weeks.

00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.169
But, hey, you should talk
to his yoga instructor.

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:10.010
I'd be happy to take you back.

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.491
Oh, thank you so much.
I'd appreciate that...

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.005
more than you can imagine,
it would be such...

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.849
- Ohh! You are naked!
- Huh?

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:18.004
Oh, for sure, we're
a naturalist club.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:21.249
Yeah. In Zootopia,
anyone can be anything.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.443
These guys, they be naked.

00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:26.570
Nangi's just on the other side
of the Pleasure Pool.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.201
Oh, boy.

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:37.169
Does this make you uncomfortable?

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:40.728
Because if so, there is no
shame in calling it quits.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.889
Yes, there is.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.043
Boy, that's the spirit.

00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.845
Yeah, some mammals say...

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.371
the naturalist life is weird...

00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.483
but you know what I say is weird?

00:38:51.720 --> 00:38:53.609
Clothes on animals!

00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.050
- Here we go.
- Mmm...

00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:58.368
As you can see, Nangi's an elephant...

00:38:58.560 --> 00:39:00.881
so she'll totally remember everything.

00:39:01.080 --> 00:39:02.161
Hey, Nangi.

00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.050
These dudes have some questions...

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:05.525
about Emmitt the otter.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.640
Who?

00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:08.449
Uh... Emmitt Otterton?

00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:10.240
Been coming to your
yoga class for like...

00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:11.441
6 years?

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.205
I have no memory of this beaver.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.084
He's an otter, actually.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:17.080
He was here a couple
Wednesdays ago, remember?

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120
No.

00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.201
Yeah, he was wearing...

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:21.726
a green cable-knit sweater vest...

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.082
and a new pair of corduroy slacks.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:27.244
Oh, and a paisley tie,
sweet Windsor knot.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.283
Real tight. Remember that, Nangi?

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.726
No.

00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.924
Yeah, and we both walked
him out, and he got into...

00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:35.611
this big old white car
with a silver trim.

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:38.605
Needed a tune-up. The third
cylinder wasn't firing.

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.768
- Remember that, Nangi?
- No.

00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.160
Uh...
You didn't happen to catch...

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.567
the license plate number, did you?

00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.604
Oh, for sure. It was 2-9...

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:50.569
T-H-D...

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.649
- 0-3.
- 0-3. Wow.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.440
This is a lot of great info. Thank you.

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:57.609
Told you Nangi has a mind
like a steel trap.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:40:01.646
I wish I had a memory like an elephant.

00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.128
Well, I had a ball.

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.600
You are welcome for the clue...

00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.848
and seeing as how any moron
can run a plate...

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.810
<i>I will take that pen and bid you adieu.</i>

00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.760
The plate. I can't run a plate.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.246
I'm not in the system yet.

00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:18.324
Give me the pen, please.

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:20.090
What was it you said?

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:22.282
"Any moron can run a plate"?

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:25.410
Gosh. If only there were
a moron around...

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:27.090
who were up to the task.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.731
Rabbit, I did what you asked!

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.490
You can't keep me on the hook forever.

00:40:30.680 --> 00:40:33.251
Not forever. Well, I only
have 36 hours left...

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:34.964
to solve this case.

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.561
So can you run the plate or not?

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.247
Actually, I just remembered...

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.811
<i>I have a pal at the DMV.</i>

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:45.520
<i>Flash is the fastest guy in there.</i>

00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.330
If you need something done, he's on it.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:49.010
I hope so. We are
really fighting the clock...

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:50.161
and every minute counts.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:55.090
Wait. They're all sloths?

00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.964
You said this was going to be quick!

00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:26.690
Are you saying
that because he's a sloth...

00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:28.171
he can't be fast?

00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.840
I thought in Zootopia,
anyone could be anything.

00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:32.640
Flash, Flash, hundred-yard dash.

00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:33.920
Buddy, it's nice to see you.

00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:36.969
Nice to...

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:38.961
see you...

00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:41.447
too.

00:41:41.720 --> 00:41:43.961
Hey, Flash, I'd love you
to meet my friend.

00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.680
Uh, darling, I've forgotten your name.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.761
Hmm.

00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.360
Officer Judy Hopps, ZPD, how are you?

00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.846
I am...

00:41:51.440 --> 00:41:52.487
doing...

00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:54.371
just...

00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.721
Fine?

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:58.042
...as well as...

00:41:58.280 --> 00:41:59.406
I can...

00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:00.881
- be.
- Hmm.

00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.166
- What...
- Hang in there.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:03.447
...can I...

00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:05.525
- do...
- Well, I was hoping...

00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.040
- you could run a...
- ...for you...

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:08.161
Well, I was hoping you could...

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:09.241
...today?

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.401
Well, I was hoping you could
run a plate for us.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.250
We are in a really big hurry.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.161
Sure.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.686
What's the...

00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:23.009
- plate...
- 2-9-T...

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.287
...number?

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:27.163
2-9-T-H-D-0-3

00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:37.401
Two...

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.886
nine...

00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:43.208
T-H-D-0-3.

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:45.286
...T...

00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:47.531
H-D-0-3.

00:42:48.440 --> 00:42:49.440
...H...

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:51.403
D-0-3.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.681
- ...D...
- Mmm-hmm.

00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.211
0-3.

00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.560
...0...

00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.681
3.

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.000
Hey, Flash, want to hear a joke?

00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.286
No!

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.086
Sure.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:11.290
Okay. What do you call
a three-humped camel?

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.691
I don't...

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:15.046
know.

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.401
What...

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:17.481
do...

00:43:17.680 --> 00:43:19.284
you call...

00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.244
- a...
- Three-humped camel.

00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:22.970
...three-humped...

00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:24.160
camel?

00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160
Pregnant.

00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.120
Ha-ha! Yes, very funny, very funny.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:44.640
Can we please just focus on the...

00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.966
- Hey...
- Wait, wait, wait!

00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:47.446
...Priscilla!

00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:48.841
Oh, no!

00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.290
Yes...

00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:53.010
Flash?

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.127
- What...
- Oh!

00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.200
Do...

00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:56.964
- No!
- ...you call a...

00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.400
A three-humped camel? "Pregnant!"

00:43:58.480 --> 00:43:59.480
Okay, great, we got it.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.927
- ...three... humped...
- Please just...

00:44:14.560 --> 00:44:16.130
- Here...
- Yeah. Hurry.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.328
- ...you...
- Thank you . "2-9-T-H-D-0-3."

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.401
...go.

00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:21.967
It's registered
to Tundratown Limo Service.

00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.280
A limo took Otterton,
and the limo's in Tundratown!

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.361
It's in Tundratown!

00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.280
Way to hustle, bud.
I love you. I owe you.

00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:29.089
Hurry! We gotta beat
the rush hour, and...

00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:31.561
It's night?

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.002
Closed. Great.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.400
Mmm.
And I will bet you...

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:38.171
you don't have
a warrant to get in. Hmm?

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.209
Darn it. It's a bummer.

00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:42.209
You wasted the day on purpose.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.323
Madam, I have a fake badge.

00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:46.562
I would never impede
your pretend investigation.

00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:49.565
It's not a pretend
investigation. Look, see?

00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:52.041
See him? This otter is missing.

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.841
Well, then they should've
gotten a real cop to find him.

00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.246
What is your problem?

00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:58.480
Does seeing me fail somehow
make you feel better...

00:44:58.560 --> 00:45:00.244
about your own sad, miserable life?

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:02.448
It does. 100%.

00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.849
Now, since you're sans warrant...

00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.845
I guess we're... done?

00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:13.604
Fine. We are done. Here's your pen.

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.086
Hey!

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:20.965
First off, you throw like a bunny.

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.168
Second, you're a very sore loser.

00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.646
See you later, Officer Fluff.

00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:27.611
So sad this is over.
I wish I could've helped more.

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.842
The thing is, you don't need a warrant...

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.161
if you have probable cause...

00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:32.360
and I'm pretty sure I saw...

00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:35.125
a shifty lowlife climbing the fence.

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:37.761
So you're helping plenty. Come on.

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:42.646
2-9-T-H-D-0-3.
This is it!

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:52.766
Polar bear fur.

00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:57.325
- Oh, my God!
- What? What?

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.240
The Velvety Pipes of Jerry Vole.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.364
But on CD.

00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:04.011
Who still uses CDs?

00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:12.527
Carrots, if your otter was here...

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.404
he had a very bad day.

00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:18.367
Those are claw marks.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:20.690
You ever seen anything like this?

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.007
No.

00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.925
Oh, wait, look.

00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:28.208
This is him,
Emmitt Otterton.

00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:30.761
He was definitely here.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.082
What do you think happened?

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:37.080
Well, now,
wait a minute.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.725
Polar bear fur,
Rat Pack music, fancy cup?

00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:43.520
I know whose car this is. We got to go.

00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:44.721
Why? Whose car is it?

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:46.400
The most feared crime-boss
in Tundratown.

00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.726
They call him Mr. Big.

00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:50.281
And he does not like me.
So we gotta go!

00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.204
I'm not leaving. This is a crime scene.

00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:53.486
Well, it's gonna be
an even bigger crime scene...

00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.720
if Mr. Big finds me here...

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.330
so we're leaving right now.

00:46:58.040 --> 00:46:59.040
Raymond!

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:01.567
And is that Kevin? Long time, no see.

00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.086
And, speaking of "no see"...

00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:06.409
how about you forget you saw me, huh?

00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:07.766
For old times' sake?

00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.887
That's a no.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:20.889
Oh...

00:47:22.880 --> 00:47:23.927
What did you do that made...

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:25.206
Mr. Big so mad at you?

00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.842
I, uh, I may have sold him
a very expensive wool rug...

00:47:29.040 --> 00:47:32.886
that was made from the fur of a skunk...

00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.083
...'s butt.

00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.401
Oh, sweet cheese and crackers.

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.480
Is that Mr. Big?

00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:55.727
No.

00:47:55.840 --> 00:47:56.921
What about him?

00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:58.400
- Is that him?
- No!

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.441
That's got to be him.

00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.440
Stop talking, stop talking, stop talking!

00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:14.449
- Huh.
- Mr. Big, sir.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:15.607
This is a simple...

00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:18.321
Yeah. Here...

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:20.321
Mmm...

00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:22.490
This is a simple misunderstanding.

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:23.640
Oh...

00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.280
You come here, unannounced...

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:27.164
on the day my daughter
is to be married.

00:48:27.560 --> 00:48:28.482
Well, actually, we were brought here...

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.640
against our will, so...

00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:33.521
The point is, I did not know
that it was your car...

00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:36.201
and I certainly did not know
about your daughter's wedding.

00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:37.441
Meh.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.329
I trusted you, Nicky.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.489
I welcomed you into my home.

00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:43.808
We broke bread together.

00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.288
Gram-mama made you a cannoli.

00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:48.722
And how did you repay my generosity?

00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:52.851
With a rug made from the butt
of a skunk.

00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.809
A skunk-butt rug.

00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:56.530
You disrespected me.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:58.842
You disrespected my Gram-mama...

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.480
who I buried in that skunk butt rug.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.526
I told you never to show
your face here again...

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:06.681
but here you are...

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:09.645
snooping around with this...

00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:11.160
What are you? A performer?

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:12.486
What's with the costume?

00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:13.720
Sir. I am a...

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:15.211
Mime! She is a mime.

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:17.363
This... mime cannot speak.

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.521
You can't speak if you're a mime.

00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.165
- No, I am a cop.
- Ugh...

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.765
And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.526
And my evidence puts him in your car.

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:26.165
So intimidate me all you want.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.442
I'm going to find out
what you did to that otter...

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.080
if it's the last thing I do.

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.880
Meh.

00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:36.005
Then I have only one request.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.602
Say hello to Gram-mama. Ice 'em.

00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.205
Whoa!

00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.731
I didn't see nothing!
I'm not saying nothing!

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.126
And you never will.

00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:45.930
- Please! No, no, no!
- Put me down!

00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.367
If you're mad at me about
the rug, I've got more rugs!

00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.610
Oh, Daddy! It's time for our dance!

00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:55.246
Oh, what did we say?

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:57.562
No icing anyone at my wedding!

00:49:57.840 --> 00:50:00.207
I have to, baby. Daddy has to.

00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.400
Ice 'em.

00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.480
No, no, no!

00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.600
Wait. Please!

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:06.884
She's the bunny
that saved my life yesterday!

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:08.451
From that giant donut.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:09.680
This bunny?

00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:11.490
Yeah! Hi!

00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.041
Hi. I love your dress.

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.049
- Oh. Thank you.
- Oh.

00:50:16.360 --> 00:50:17.360
Put 'em down.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.445
You've done me a great service.

00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:24.762
I will help you find the otter.

00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.921
I will take your kindness
and pay it forward.

00:50:35.520 --> 00:50:37.120
Smile.

00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:39.404
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:43.164
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.360
Hmm.

00:50:57.920 --> 00:50:59.604
Otterton
is my florist.

00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:02.441
He's like a part of the family.

00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.610
He had something important
he wanted to discuss.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.684
That's why I sent that car to pick him up.

00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:11.164
But he never arrived.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:12.965
Because he was attacked.

00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.806
No. He attacked.

00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.367
Otterton?

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.604
Otterton. He went crazy.

00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.805
Ripped up the car, scared
my driver half to death...

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.321
and disappeared into the night.

00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.729
But he's a sweet little otter.

00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:35.966
Hmm. My child, we may
be evolved, but deep down...

00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.487
we are still animals.

00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.607
<i>You want to find Otterton,</i>

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.648
<i>talk to the driver of that car</i>

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.325
<i>His name is Manchas...</i>

00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:48.171
<i>lives in the Rainforest District.</i>

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.806
<i>Only he can tell you more.</i>

00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.244
Mr. Manchas?

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.369
Judy Hopps, ZPD.

00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:01.683
We just wanna know what
happened to Emmitt Otterton.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:07.601
You...

00:52:07.840 --> 00:52:09.001
should be asking...

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.526
- what happened to me.
- Whoa!

00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.044
Uh, a teensy otter did that?

00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:17.401
What happened?

00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:19.688
He was an animal.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
<i>Down...</i>

00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:24.527
<i>on all fours.</i>

00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:28.931
<i>He was a savage!</i>

00:52:39.800 --> 00:52:40.926
There was no warning.

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.970
He just kept yelling about
the Night Howlers.

00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:47.044
Over and over. The Night Howlers.

00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.449
So you know about
the Night Howlers, too?

00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:52.051
Good. Good, good.

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:53.884
Because the Night Howlers...

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.890
are exactly what we are here
to talk about.

00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.451
- Right?
- Yup.

00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:01.243
So, uh, so you just open the door...

00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.965
and tell us what you know...

00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:05.402
and we will tell you
what we know. Okay?

00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.088
Okay.

00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.083
Clever fox.

00:53:15.800 --> 00:53:17.928
Mr. Manchas?

00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.200
Buddy?

00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.280
Are you...

00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.440
okay?

00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:29.924
Run. Run!

00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:35.967
What is wrong with him?

00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:37.486
I don't know!

00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:43.520
Jump!

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:47.160
Come on!

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.600
- Head down!
- Oh. Oh!

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.480
Officer Hopps to Dispatch.

00:53:56.720 --> 00:53:58.370
Are you familiar with Gazelle,
greatest singer

00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:00.280
of our lifetime,
angel with horns?

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:01.970
Okay, hold on. Keep watching.

00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:03.400
Who's that beside her? Who is it?

00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.728
<i>Wow, you are one hot dancer,
Benjamin Clawhauser</i>

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.721
It's me! Did you think it was real?

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:11.880
It looks so real!

00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:14.646
It's not, it's just a new app.
Hold on a second.

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.166
<i>Clawhauser!</i>

00:54:16.440 --> 00:54:18.647
Clawhauser, listen to me,
we have a 10-91!

00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.171
<i>Jaguar gone savage!</i>

00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:21.440
Vine and Tuh-junja!

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:23.210
- It's "Tuh-hunga!"
- Whoa!

00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.200
<i>Okay, we're
sending backup! Hopps?</i>

00:54:25.440 --> 00:54:26.851
<i>Hopps!</i>

00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.440
There!

00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.885
Head for the sky trams!

00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:41.844
Get in! Carrots.

00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:43.040
Carrots!

00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.160
Go!

00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:47.329
No, no, no!

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:48.760
Buddy.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.843
One predator to another...

00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.086
No, no, no...

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.849
Now, I can tell you're a little tense...

00:54:57.040 --> 00:54:59.280
so I'm just gonna give you
a little personal space! Ah!

00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.283
Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go!

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.290
- I'm gonna let go!
- No, you, what?

00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.249
- One, two...
- No...

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.368
I said, do not... Rabbit!

00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.086
Carrots. You saved my life.

00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.891
Well. That's what we do at the ZPD.

00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.528
Hmm.

00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:45.490
Well, this should be good.

00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:47.731
I thought this was
just a missing mammal case...

00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.410
but it's way bigger.

00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:51.682
Mr. Otterton did not just disappear.

00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.885
I believe he and this jaguar,
they went savage, sir.

00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:58.726
Savage? This isn't
the Stone Age, Hopps.

00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:00.729
Animals don't "go savage."

00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:04.089
I thought so, too, until I saw this.

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:08.811
What? He was right here.

00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.565
The "savage" jaguar?

00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:13.765
Sir, I know what I saw.
He almost killed us!

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.722
Or, maybe any aggressive predator...

00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.081
looks savage to you rabbits.

00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:20.241
Let's go!

00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.480
Wait, sir.

00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.290
I'm not the only one who saw him.

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.130
Nick!

00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:27.489
You think I'm gonna believe a fox?

00:56:27.720 --> 00:56:29.370
Well, he was a key witness, and I...

00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.523
Two days to find the otter...

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.569
or you quit.

00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.762
That was the deal.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.604
Badge.

00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:44.921
- But, sir, we...
- Badge!

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.566
Uh, no.

00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:54.245
What did you say, fox?

00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:57.967
Sorry. What I said was, "no."

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.806
She will not be giving you that badge.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.729
Look, you give her a clown vest...

00:57:02.840 --> 00:57:04.729
and a three-wheeled joke-mobile...

00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.200
and two days to solve a case...

00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.884
you guys haven't cracked in two weeks?

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.801
Yeah.

00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:11.485
It's no wonder she needed
to get help from a fox.

00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.802
None of you guys
were gonna help her, were you?

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.320
- Ho...
- Here's the thing, Chief.

00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:16.805
You gave her the 48 hours...

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.968
so, technically, we still have...

00:57:19.240 --> 00:57:21.288
10 left to find our Mr. Otterton...

00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.642
and that is exactly what we're gonna do.

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.080
So, if you'll excuse us...

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:28.329
we have a very big lead
to follow and a case to crack.

00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.811
Good day.

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.166
Officer Hopps.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:01.205
Thank you.

00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:04.681
Never let them see that they get to you.

00:58:06.040 --> 00:58:07.201
So...

00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.761
things do get to you?

00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:12.361
No, I mean, not anymore...

00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.164
but I was small...

00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.521
and emotionally unbalanced
like you once.

00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.807
Har-har.

00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.803
No, it's true.

00:58:20.040 --> 00:58:23.044
I think I was 8, or maybe 9...

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:25.163
and all I wanted to do...

00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:28.523
was join the Junior Ranger Scouts.

00:58:28.720 --> 00:58:31.121
<i>So, my mom scraped together
enough money...</i>

00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.561
<i>to buy me a brand-new uniform...</i>

00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.127
<i>because, by God, I was gonna fit in.</i>

00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:39.643
<i>Even if I was the only
predator in the troop.</i>

00:58:39.880 --> 00:58:40.880
<i>The only fox.</i>

00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:42.040
Okay, Nick.

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.525
<i>I was gonna be
part of a pack.</i>

00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:45.051
Ready for initiation?

00:58:45.240 --> 00:58:47.083
Yeah. Pretty much born ready.

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:49.006
<i>I was so proud.</i>

00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:52.721
Okay.

00:58:52.920 --> 00:58:55.241
Now, raise your right paw
and deliver the oath.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.924
I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave...

00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:02.010
loyal, helpful, and trustworthy.

00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.005
Even though you're a fox?

00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:07.766
What?

00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.320
No. No! What did I do wrong, you guys?

00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:14.442
No, please! Tell me!
What did I do wrong?

00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.369
<i>What did I do?</i>

00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.845
No...

00:59:18.200 --> 00:59:19.565
If you thought we would ever
trust a fox...

00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:20.721
without a muzzle...

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.770
you're even dumber than you look!

00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.201
Cry baby.

00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.931
Aw, is he gonna cry?

00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:46.166
<i>I learned
two things that day.</i>

00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.640
<i>One...</i>

00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:51.845
I was never gonna let anyone
see that they got to me.

00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:54.967
And two?

00:59:55.160 --> 00:59:57.766
If the world's only gonna see a fox...

00:59:57.920 --> 01:00:00.287
as shifty and untrustworthy...

01:00:00.480 --> 01:00:03.450
there's no point in trying
to be anything else.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:07.167
Nick, you are so much more than that.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.964
Boy, look at that traffic down there.

01:00:13.160 --> 01:00:14.764
How about we go out to Chuck
in Traffic Central.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:16.800
Chuck, how are things looking
on the Jam Cams?

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.962
Nick, I'm glad you told me.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:22.411
The Jam Cams.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.251
- Seriously. It's okay.
- No, no, no.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:28.450
There are traffic cameras everywhere!

01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.284
All over the canopy!

01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:31.920
Whatever happened to that jaguar...

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.201
The traffic cams would have caught it!

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.686
- Bingo!
- Ho-ho!

01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.080
Pretty sneaky, slick!

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:39.728
However, if you didn't have
access to the system before...

01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:43.407
I doubt Chief Buffalo Butt
is gonna let you into it now.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.846
No.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.001
But I have a friend
at City Hall who might.

01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:51.611
Sir, if we could just review
these very important...

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.081
Sir...

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.406
I'm so sorry. Sir!

01:00:54.640 --> 01:00:57.689
Okay. I heard you, Bellwether.
Just take care of it.

01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.767
Please. And clear
my afternoon. I'm going out.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.240
No, no! But, sir,
you do have a meeting...

01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.441
with Herds and Grazing.

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.885
Sir, if I could just...

01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:08.489
Oh, mutton chops.

01:01:10.360 --> 01:01:11.771
Assistant Mayor Bellwether?

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.081
We need your help.

01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.920
We just need to get into
the traffic cam database.

01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:26.931
So fluffy!

01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.121
Hey!

01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.565
Sheep never let me get this close.

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.240
You can't just touch a sheep's wool!

01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:32.441
It's like cotton candy.

01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:33.521
Stop it!

01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:34.647
Where to?

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.010
Uh, Rainforest District,
Vine and Tujunga.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.360
There! Traffic
cams for the whole city.

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.528
Oh, this is so exciting,
actually!

01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:44.400
I never get to do
anything this important.

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.881
But you're the Assistant Mayor
of Zootopia.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.401
Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary.

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.041
I think Mayor Lionheart
just wanted the sheep vote.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.600
But he did give me that nice mug.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.486
- Oh.
- Hmm.

01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:57.165
Feels good to be appreciated.

01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:58.646
<i>Smell-wether!</i>

01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:01.531
Ugh. That's a fun little name
he likes to use.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.569
I called him Lion-fart once.

01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:04.921
He did not care for that.
Let me tell you...

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.240
it was not a good day for me.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:07.327
Yes, sir?

01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:08.731
<i>I thought you were going
to cancel my afternoon!</i>

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:10.849
Oh, dear. I better go.

01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:12.565
Let me know what you find.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.643
It was really nice for me to be...

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:15.881
<i>- While we're young...
- Oh...</i>

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.809
<i>Smell-wether!</i>

01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:20.884
You think when she goes
to sleep she counts herself?

01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.804
Oh, shush. Okay, traffic cams.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.164
Tujunga, Tujunga... We're in.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.360
- Who are these guys?
- Ugh.

01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:37.610
Timberwolves.
Look at these dumb-dumbs.

01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:44.811
Bet you a nickel
one of them is gonna howl.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.280
And there it is.

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.171
What is it with wolves
and the howling? It's like...

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:51.243
Howlers. Night Howlers.

01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.562
That's what Manchas
was afraid of! Wolves!

01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:55.160
The wolves are the Night Howlers.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:56.366
If they took Manchas...

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:58.090
I'll bet they took Otterton, too.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:03:00.766
All we gotta do is find out
where they went.

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:09.361
Wait, where did they go?

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.249
You know, if I wanted
to avoid surveillance...

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.606
because I was doing
something illegal...

01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:13.887
which I never have...

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:15.689
I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.601
Which would put them out...

01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:19.810
right there.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.483
Well, look at you, Junior Detective.

01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.762
You know, I think you'd actually...

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:27.843
make a pretty good cop.

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.809
Ugh. How dare you.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:31.241
Acacia Alley?

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.606
Ficus Underpass.

01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.160
- South Canyon.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.440
They're heading out of town.

01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:37.405
Where does that road go?

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.207
Gary, quit it!

01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.446
You're gonna start a howl.

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.160
I didn't start it!

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.361
Come on.

01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.811
You are a clever bunny.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.729
It looks like
this was a hospital.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.450
You know, after you. You're the cop.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.640
Hmm.

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.686
- Okay, all clear.
- Ugh.

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.041
Huh.

01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.687
All this equipment is brand new.

01:05:38.360 --> 01:05:39.361
Carrots.

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.087
Claw marks.

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:45.726
Yeah, huge, huge claw marks.
I mean, what kind of...

01:06:05.320 --> 01:06:07.163
Mr. Manchas.

01:06:17.040 --> 01:06:18.280
It's him.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:20.688
We found our otter.

01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:22.365
Mr. Otterton.

01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:25.843
My name is Officer Judy Hopps.
Your wife sent me to find you.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.560
We're gonna get you out of here now.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.486
Or not.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.921
Guess he's in no rush
to get home to the missus.

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.249
11, 12, 13, 14...

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.450
Not including Manchas, it's 14.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.485
Chief Bogo handed out
14 missing mammal files.

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.687
They're all here.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.646
All the missing mammals are right here.

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.525
Enough! I don't
want excuses, Doctor!

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:55.801
I want answers.

01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:57.086
Mayor Lionheart, please.

01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.964
We're doing everything we can.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:00.241
Really?

01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:02.126
Because I got a dozen
and a half animals here...

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.844
who have gone off-the-rails crazy...

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.525
and you can't tell me why.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.451
Now, I'd call that awfully far
from "doing everything ."

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.681
Sir...

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.684
it may be time to consider their biology.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.729
What? What do you mean "biology?"

01:07:13.920 --> 01:07:16.571
The only animals
going savage are predators.

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:19.525
We cannot keep it a secret.
We need to come forward.

01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:22.527
Hmm. Great idea. Tell the public.

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.000
And how do you think they're...

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.684
gonna feel about their mayor...

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.524
who is a lion?

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:28.841
I'll be ruined!

01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.126
Well,
what does Chief Bogo say?

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.448
Chief Bogo doesn't know.

01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:35.490
And we are going to keep it that way.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.523
Oh, no, no, no!

01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:38.807
Someone's here.

01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.530
Sir, you need to go, now!

01:07:40.760 --> 01:07:42.364
Security! Sweep the area!

01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.124
Great! We're dead. We're dead.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.727
That's it. I'm dead,
you're dead. Everybody's dead!

01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:56.007
Can you swim?

01:07:56.240 --> 01:07:58.925
What? Can I swim?
Yes, I can swim. Why?

01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:11.725
No, no, no!

01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:22.851
Carrots! Hopps! Judy!

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.204
We gotta tell Bogo!

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.840
<i>Wow!</i>

01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:30.806
<i>You are one hot dancer, Chief Bogo.</i>

01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:35.004
- Chief Bogo!
- Not now!

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:37.242
- Wait, is that Gazelle?
- No.

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:40.131
<i>I'm Gazelle, and
you are one hot dancer</i>

01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.130
You have the app too? Oh...

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.526
Chief!

01:08:44.800 --> 01:08:46.006
Clawhauser, can't you see
I'm working...

01:08:46.160 --> 01:08:47.366
on the missing mammal cases?

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.642
Oh, oh, oh! Yes of course!
About that, sir.

01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.121
Officer Hopps just called.

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.321
She found all of them.

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:55.162
<i>Wow! I'm impressed.</i>

01:08:58.240 --> 01:08:59.526
Mayor Lionheart,
you have the right...

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:00.886
to remain silent. Anything...

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.691
You don't understand. I was
trying to protect the city!

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:05.922
You were just trying to protect your job.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:09.090
No. Listen, we still don't
know why this is happening.

01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:11.243
It could destroy Zootopia.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:12.761
You have the right to remain silent.

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.166
Anything you say can and will...

01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:15.840
be used against you in a court of law.

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:19.043
You have the right...

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.200
<i>Ladies
and gentlemammals.</i>

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.010
<i>14 mammals went missing...</i>

01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:28.967
<i>and all 14 have been found
by our newest recruit...</i>

01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:30.560
<i>who will speak to you in a moment.</i>

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.000
<i>But first let me remind you...</i>

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:33.041
Ugh. I'm so nervous.

01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.009
Okay. Press Conference 101.

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:36.281
You wanna look smart?

01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.720
Answer their question
with your own question...

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.930
and then answer that question.
Like this.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:42.525
"Excuse me. Officer Hopps...

01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:44.444
"uh, what can you tell us
about the case?"

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.205
"Well, was this a tough case?

01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.368
"Yes. Yes, it was." You see?

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:50.324
You should be there with me.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.800
We did this together.

01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.129
Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.402
Hmm. Funny you should say that...

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.881
because I've been thinking...

01:10:00.160 --> 01:10:04.563
It would be nice to have a partner.

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:12.170
Here. In case you need
something to write with.

01:10:14.760 --> 01:10:16.000
<i>At twenty-two hundred hours...</i>

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:17.650
<i>we found all these missing animals...</i>

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.247
Officer Hopps, it's time.

01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:21.806
<i>They appear to be
in good health, physically . .</i>

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.760
<i>...if not emotionally</i>

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.362
So now, I'll turn things over...

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:29.285
to the officer who cracked the case.

01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:31.210
Officer Judy Hopps.

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:34.609
- Officer Hopps!
- Officer Hopps!

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:35.841
Over here!

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.960
Yes?

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:38.605
What can you tell us about
the animals that went savage?

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.408
Well, the animals
in question, um...

01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.568
Are they all different species?

01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:50.723
Yes. Yes, they are.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.123
Okay,
so what is the connection?

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.328
Oh, all we know is that they...

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.050
are all members of the predator family.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:01.251
So, predators are
the only ones going savage?

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:04.007
That is ac... Yes, that is accurate. Yes.

01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:05.520
Why? Why is this happening?

01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.841
We still don't know.

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.441
It may have something
to do with biology.

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.846
What do you
mean by that?

01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:17.043
A biological component.

01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.568
You know, something in their DNA.

01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:23.641
In their DNA? Can you
elaborate on that, please?

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:27.766
Yes, what I mean is,
thousands of years ago...

01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:33.971
uh, predators survived through
their aggressive...

01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:35.844
hunting instincts.

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.007
For whatever reason...

01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:39.329
they seem to be reverting back...

01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:41.410
to their primitive, savage ways.

01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:43.000
Of course they did.

01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.683
<i>Aw, is he gonna cry?</i>

01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:47.763
Officer
Hopps, could it happen again?

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.811
It is possible. So we must be vigilant.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.607
And we at the ZPD are prepared
and are here to protect you.

01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.046
Will more mammals go savage?

01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:57.406
What is being done to protect us?

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.761
Have you considered

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.041
a mandatory quarantine on predators?

01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.770
Okay, thank you, Officer Hopps.

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.480
Uh, that's all the time that we have.

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:04.766
No more questions.

01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:08.606
Was I okay?

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.887
Oh, you did fine.

01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:12.766
Oh, that went so fast.

01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.046
I didn't get a chance to mention you...

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:15.440
or say anything about how we...

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.926
Oh, I think you said plenty.

01:12:18.440 --> 01:12:19.601
What do you mean?

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.241
"Clearly there's
a biological component?"

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.046
"These predators may be
reverting back...

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.282
"to their primitive, savage ways?"

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.045
Are you serious?

01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:31.727
I just stated the facts of the case.

01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:34.247
I mean, it's not like
a bunny could go savage.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.289
Right. But a fox could, huh?

01:12:36.520 --> 01:12:38.807
Nick, stop it. You're not like them.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.844
Oh, there's a "them" now?

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:42.200
Ugh. You know what I mean.

01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:43.685
You're not that kind of predator.

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.331
The kind that needs to be muzzled?

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.846
The kind that makes you think...

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.480
you need to carry around fox repellent?

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.761
Yeah, don't think I didn't...

01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:53.366
notice that little item
the first time we met.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.803
So let me ask you a question.
Are you afraid of me?

01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.767
Do you think I might go nuts?

01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:03.089
Do you think I might go savage?

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.402
Do you think I might try to...

01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:06.527
eat you?

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:11.725
I knew it.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.321
Just when I thought somebody
actually believed in me, huh.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:20.246
Probably best if you don't
have a predator as a partner.

01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:28.168
No. Nick. Nick!

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.289
Officer Hopps! Were you just
threatened by that predator?

01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:32.130
No, he's my friend.

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.129
We can't even trust our own friends?

01:13:34.320 --> 01:13:36.004
That is not what I said! Please!

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.160
Are we safe?

01:13:37.240 --> 01:13:39.240
Have any
of our foxes gone savage?

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.641
<i>More bad news
in this city gripped by fear</i>

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:43.683
<i>A caribou is in critical condition...</i>

01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.921
<i>the victim of a mauling...</i>

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.923
<i>by a savage polar bear</i>

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:49.600
<i>This, the 27th such attack,
comes just one week...</i>

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.009
<i>after ZPD Officer Judy Hopps
connected the violence...</i>

01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.851
<i>to traditionally predatory animals.</i>

01:13:56.160 --> 01:13:57.889
<i>Meanwhile, a peace rally organized...</i>

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.604
<i>by pop star Gazelle...</i>

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.165
<i>was marred by protest.</i>

01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:03.249
<i>Go back to the forest predator!</i>

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.970
<i>I'm from the savanna!</i>

01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.003
<i>Zootopia is a unique place.</i>

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:10.602
<i>It's a crazy, beautiful, diverse city...</i>

01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:13.161
<i>where we celebrate our differences.</i>

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.725
<i>This is not the Zootopia I know</i>

01:14:16.320 --> 01:14:19.369
<i>The Zootopia I know
is better than this.</i>

01:14:19.640 --> 01:14:21.768
<i>We don't just blindly assign blame.</i>

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.128
<i>We don't know why these
attacks keep happening...</i>

01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:31.889
<i>but it is irresponsible...</i>

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.247
<i>to label all predators as savages.</i>

01:14:40.680 --> 01:14:42.728
That's not my Emmitt.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.641
<i>We cannot
let fear divide us.</i>

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:52.368
<i>Please give me back
the Zootopia I love.</i>

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.925
Come on, Hopps.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.360
The new mayor wants to see us.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:15:00.887
The mayor? Why?

01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:04.005
It would seem you've arrived.

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:08.731
Clawhauser?

01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:10.564
What are you doing?

01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:11.921
Um...

01:15:12.520 --> 01:15:14.329
They thought it would be better...

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:16.722
if a predator such as myself...

01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.247
wasn't the first face that you see...

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:21.568
when you walk into the ZPD.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.290
What?

01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.445
They're gonna move me to records.

01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:26.567
It's downstairs.

01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.083
It's by the boiler.

01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.725
Hopps!

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.085
Um, I don't understand.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.244
Our city is 90% prey, Judy...

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.926
and right now
they're just really scared.

01:15:47.720 --> 01:15:50.610
You're a hero to them. They trust you.

01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:53.770
And so that's why Chief Bogo and I...

01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:57.089
want you to be
the public face of the ZPD.

01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:04.611
I'm... not...

01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.290
I'm not a hero.

01:16:08.120 --> 01:16:11.488
I came here to make
the world a better place...

01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.210
but I think I broke it.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:17.365
Don't give yourself
so much credit, Hopps.

01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:19.040
The world has always been broken...

01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:21.122
that's why we need good cops.

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.801
Like you.

01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:30.321
With all due respect, sir, a good cop...

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.803
is supposed to serve and protect.

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.122
Help the city.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.887
Not tear it apart.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.602
I don't deserve this badge.

01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.806
Hopps...

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:49.083
Judy, you've worked
so hard to get here.

01:16:49.320 --> 01:16:51.687
It's what you wanted
since you were a kid.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.644
You can't quit.

01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.809
Thank you for the opportunity.

01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:16.765
A dozen carrots.

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.080
- Thanks.
- Have a nice day.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:19.321
Come on.

01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.842
Hey, there, Jude. Jude the dude.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:30.844
Remember that one?
How we doing?

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.161
I'm fine.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:34.607
You are not fine. Your ears are droopy.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:38.123
Why did I think
I could make a difference?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.044
Because you're a trier, that's why.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.884
You've always been a trier.

01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:43.286
Oh, I tried.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:45.522
And it made life so much worse...

01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:47.404
for so many innocent predators.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:48.721
Oh, not all of them, though.

01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:49.921
Speak of the devil.

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.201
Right on time.

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:56.051
Is that Gideon Grey?

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.203
Yep. It sure is. We work with him now.

01:17:58.480 --> 01:17:59.527
He's our partner.

01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.567
And we never
would have considered it...

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:01.767
had you not opened our minds.

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:02.840
That's right.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:04.126
I mean, Gid's turned into one of...

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:05.920
the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows.

01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:09.730
That's...

01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:12.611
That's really cool, you guys.

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:14.440
Gideon Grey.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.081
I'll be darned.

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.487
Hey, Judy. I'd just like
to say I'm sorry...

01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:20.642
for the way I behaved in my youth.

01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:24.129
I had a lot of self-doubt,
and it manifested itself...

01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.328
in the form of unchecked rage
and aggression.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:28.642
I was a major jerk.

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:33.242
Oh, I know a thing or two
about being a jerk.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:36.966
Anyhow, I brought y'all these pies.

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:39.840
Hey, kids, don't you run through...

01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:41.325
<i>that midnicampum holicithias.</i>

01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.606
Whoa, whoa, whoa...

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:44.603
Well, now, there's a $4 word, Mr. H.

01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:47.446
My family always just
called them Night Howlers.

01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:50.365
I'm so... What did you say?

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.280
Oh, Gid's talking about
those flowers, Judy.

01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:54.050
I use them to keep the bugs
off the produce...

01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:55.770
but I don't like the little
ones going near 'em...

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.326
on account of what happened
to your uncle Terry.

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:59.449
Yeah, Terry ate one whole
when we were kids...

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.641
and went completely nuts.

01:19:00.920 --> 01:19:03.127
He bit the dickens out of your mother.

01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.601
A bunny can go savage.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:07.803
Savage? Well, that's a strong word.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:09.200
But it did hurt like the devil.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.321
Well, sure it did!

01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:12.004
There's a sizable divot in your arm.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.445
I'd call that savage.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.803
Night Howlers aren't wolves,
they're flowers!

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:19.486
The flowers are making
the predators go savage!

01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:20.687
That's it!

01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:22.171
That's what I've been missing!

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:23.881
Oh, keys!

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:25.360
Keys, keys, keys! Hurry! Come on!

01:19:25.600 --> 01:19:27.967
Oh! Thank you! I love you! Bye!

01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:34.560
You catch
any of that, Bon?

01:19:34.760 --> 01:19:35.841
Not one bit.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:37.485
Oh, that makes me
feel a little bit better.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.642
I thought she was talking
in tongues or something.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.564
Who is it?

01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:00.000
I need to find Nick.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.531
Please.

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:03.841
Nick?

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.846
Nick!

01:20:08.480 --> 01:20:10.005
Oh, Nick.

01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.049
Night Howlers aren't wolves.

01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:13.924
They're toxic flowers.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.244
I think someone is targeting
predators on purpose...

01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.721
and making them go savage!

01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:20.406
Wow.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.523
Isn't that interesting?

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.126
Wait... Wait! Listen...

01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:28.691
I know you'll never forgive me!

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:29.927
And I don't blame you.

01:20:30.920 --> 01:20:33.890
I wouldn't forgive me either.
I was ignorant...

01:20:34.920 --> 01:20:38.561
And irresponsible and small-minded.

01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:42.566
But predators shouldn't suffer
because of my mistakes.

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.443
I have to fix this.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.281
But I can't do it without you.

01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:53.325
And after we're done...

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.244
you can hate me.

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:57.886
And... And that'll be fine.

01:20:58.120 --> 01:21:01.329
Because I was a horrible friend...

01:21:01.560 --> 01:21:02.925
and I hurt you...

01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:09.571
and you can walk away knowing
that you were right all along.

01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:13.725
I really am just a dumb bunny.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:21.281
<i>I really am
just a dumb bunny.</i>

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.209
<i>I really am just a dumb bunny.</i>

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:29.330
Don't worry, Carrots.
I'll let you erase it...

01:21:29.440 --> 01:21:30.601
in 48 hours.

01:21:33.440 --> 01:21:35.886
All right. Get in here.

01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:41.805
Okay. Oh, you bunnies.
You're so emotional.

01:21:42.080 --> 01:21:44.401
There we go. Deep breath.

01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:46.602
Are you just trying to steal the pen?

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.290
Is that what this is?

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.123
You are standing on my tail,
though. Off, off, off, off...

01:21:51.240 --> 01:21:52.240
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.811
Ooh, I thought you guys
only grew carrots.

01:21:59.960 --> 01:22:01.689
Mmm. What's the plan?

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.524
We are gonna follow the Night Howlers.

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:04.966
Okay. How?

01:22:05.160 --> 01:22:06.446
Know this guy?

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:09.008
Uh-huh. I told you. I know everybody.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:13.450
Well, hello. Step right up.
Anything you need, I got it.

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.131
All your favorite movies!

01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.806
I got movies that haven't
even been released yet.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:21.484
Hey, 15% off! 20!
Make me an offer! Come on!

01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:25.327
Well, well, look who it is.
The duke of bootleg.

01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:26.720
What's it to you, Wilde?

01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:28.171
Shouldn't you be melting down
a Popsicle or something?

01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.760
Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy.

01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.644
We both know those
weren't moldy onions...

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:34.006
I caught you stealing.

01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:35.320
What were you gonna do with...

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.441
those Night Howlers, Wezzleton?

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:38.528
It's Weaselton! Duke Weaselton!

01:22:38.800 --> 01:22:40.529
And I ain't talking, rabbit.

01:22:40.800 --> 01:22:42.848
And there ain't nothing
you can do to make me.

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:45.520
Ice him.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.001
You dirty rat!

01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:51.161
Why are you helping her? She's a cop!

01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:54.569
And the godmother
to my future granddaughter.

01:22:54.720 --> 01:22:56.643
I'm gonna name her Judy.

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:58.171
Oh!

01:22:58.720 --> 01:22:59.846
Ice this weasel.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:02.360
All right, all right, please!
I'll talk! I'll talk.

01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:03.890
I stole them Night Howlers
so I could sell 'em.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:05.844
They offered me what I couldn't refuse.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000
Money.

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:09.049
And to whom did you sell them?

01:23:09.240 --> 01:23:10.480
A ram named Doug.

01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:12.090
We got a drop spot underground.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.321
<i>Just watch it.</i>

01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.204
<i>Doug is the opposite of friendly</i>

01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.845
<i>He's unfriendly</i>

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:29.365
Come on.

01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:43.924
The weasel wasn't lying.

01:23:44.200 --> 01:23:45.611
Yeah, looks like old Doug's cornered...

01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.125
the market on Night Howlers.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.650
You got Doug here.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:34.768
What's the mark?

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:39.170
Cheetah in Sahara Square. Got it.

01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:41.000
You serious? Yeah, I know they're fast.

01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:42.281
I can hit him.

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:44.482
Listen, I hit a tiny little otter...

01:24:44.680 --> 01:24:46.240
through the open window
of a moving car.

01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:02.482
Yeah, I'll buzz you
when it's done.

01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:03.681
Or you'll see it on the news.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.171
You know, whichever comes first.

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:09.648
Hey, Doug, open up!
We've got your latte.

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.201
All right. Woolter and Jesse
are back, so I'm leaving now.

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.521
Out.

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:15.170
Hey. Where
are you going? Get back here!

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:17.203
What are you doing?
He's gonna see you!

01:25:17.600 --> 01:25:18.840
What are you looking at? Hey!

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.607
Whatever you're thinking,
stop thinking it. Carrots!

01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:23.681
Carrots!

01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:26.003
It better have
the extra foam this time.

01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:30.281
Hey, open up!

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.681
What are you doing?
You just trapped us in here.

01:25:32.920 --> 01:25:34.570
We need to get this
evidence to the ZPD!

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.730
Okay. Great! Here it is. Got it!

01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.849
- No. All of it!
- Wait, what?

01:25:42.680 --> 01:25:45.160
Oh, great, you're a conductor now, huh?

01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.691
Hey, listen. It would take a miracle...

01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:48.165
to get this rust-bucket going.

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.849
Well. Hallelujah.

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:54.487
We kinda got a situation at the lab.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:56.210
Oh, it just got worse!

01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.206
Mission accomplished.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.367
Would it be premature for me...

01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:01.840
to do a little victory toot-toot?

01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:04.366
All right. One toot-toot.

01:26:06.720 --> 01:26:09.246
Well, I can cross that
off the bucket list.

01:26:20.120 --> 01:26:22.691
I may have to rescind
that victory toot-toot.

01:26:24.520 --> 01:26:25.885
Maybe that's just hail.

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:27.526
Come here!

01:26:29.800 --> 01:26:30.926
Back off! Oh!

01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:33.887
Whoa!

01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:37.121
Incoming!

01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:40.761
Carrots!

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.365
Don't stop! Keep going!

01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.800
No, no! Please stop!

01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:45.769
Do not stop this car!

01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:55.401
Whoa!

01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:57.961
Oh!

01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:09.446
Speed up, Nick! Speed up!

01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:10.920
There's another train coming!

01:27:11.160 --> 01:27:12.730
Trust me. Speed up!

01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:17.966
Stop the train!

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:20.881
Hey!

01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.644
Need some help?

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.525
Oh, no, no, no!
Too fast! Too fast!

01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:28.601
Hold on!

01:27:28.920 --> 01:27:29.920
Ahh!

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.764
I think this is our stop!

01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:54.331
Okay, maybe some
of the evidence survived.

01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:01.487
Oh!

01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:05.365
Everything is gone.

01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:07.841
We've lost it all.

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:09.007
Yeah...

01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:10.885
Oh, except for this.

01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:13.811
- Ow.
- Ooh, Nick! Yes!

01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:16.048
Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD.

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:18.888
Cut through
the Natural History Museum!

01:28:30.560 --> 01:28:31.607
There it is!

01:28:31.680 --> 01:28:32.681
Judy!

01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:34.845
Judy!

01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:36.849
Mayor Bellwether!

01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:38.320
We found out what's happening.

01:28:38.360 --> 01:28:40.169
Someone's darting
predators with a serum.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.203
That's what's making them go savage.

01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.250
I'm so proud of you, Judy.
You did just a super job!

01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:47.687
Thank you, ma'am.

01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:53.083
How did you know where to find us?

01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.049
I'll go ahead and
I'll take that case now.

01:28:55.240 --> 01:28:56.526
Uh, you know what?

01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:00.321
I think Nick and I will just
take this to the ZPD.

01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.047
Run.

01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.571
Get them.

01:29:12.400 --> 01:29:13.447
Ahh!

01:29:14.040 --> 01:29:15.121
Carrots!

01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:17.690
I got you!

01:29:17.800 --> 01:29:19.245
Come here, come here.

01:29:21.400 --> 01:29:23.448
Okay, now just relax.

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:25.768
Whoops... Blueberry?

01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.041
Pass.

01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:30.922
Come on out, Judy.

01:29:31.160 --> 01:29:32.366
Take the case.

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:33.607
Get it to Bogo.

01:29:33.880 --> 01:29:35.530
I'm not gonna leave you
behind. That's not happening.

01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:36.966
I can't walk.

01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:38.201
Just... We'll think of something.

01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.647
We're on
the same team, Judy.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:44.771
Underestimated, underappreciated.

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.082
Aren't you sick of it?

01:29:49.880 --> 01:29:53.601
Predators.
They may be strong and loud...

01:29:53.800 --> 01:29:57.441
but prey outnumber predators 10 to 1.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.161
Think of it.

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.289
90% of the population...

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:06.642
united against a common enemy.

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:09.288
We'll be unstoppable.

01:30:12.880 --> 01:30:13.927
Huh?

01:30:15.280 --> 01:30:16.805
Over there!

01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:21.641
Help!

01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:34.646
Well, you should have just stayed...

01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.086
on the carrot farm, huh?

01:30:36.320 --> 01:30:38.800
It really is too bad.
I... I did like you.

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.526
What are you going to do? Kill me?

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.643
No, of course not.

01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:45.841
He is.

01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:49.005
No! Oh, Nick!

01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:52.286
Yes, police! There's a savage fox...

01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.129
in the Natural History Museum.

01:30:54.320 --> 01:30:56.448
Officer Hopps is down! Please, hurry.

01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:59.008
No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:02.121
Oh, but he can't help it, can he?

01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:04.567
Since preds are just biologically...

01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:06.802
predisposed to be savages.

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.686
Gosh. Think of the headline!

01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:24.851
"Hero cop killed by savage fox."

01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:28.043
So that's it? Prey fears predator...

01:31:28.200 --> 01:31:29.690
and you stay in power?

01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:31.405
Yeah, pretty much.

01:31:31.640 --> 01:31:32.687
It won't work!

01:31:32.960 --> 01:31:35.361
Fear always works.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:36.846
And I'll dart every predator...

01:31:36.960 --> 01:31:38.724
in Zootopia to keep it that way.

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:42.921
Oh, Nick.

01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:44.726
No.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.565
Bye-bye, bunny.

01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:55.007
Bleh...

01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:59.244
Blood! Blood! Blood and death.

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:00.720
All right, you know, you're milking it.

01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.160
Besides, I think we got it.
I think we got it.

01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.641
We got it up there,
thank you, Yakety-yak!

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:06.450
You laid it all out beautifully.

01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:07.640
What?

01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:09.480
Yeah... Oh, are you
looking for the serum?

01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:10.561
Well, it's right here.

01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:12.200
What you've got in the weapon there?

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.647
Those are blueberries.
From my family's farm.

01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.763
They are delicious.
You should try some.

01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:21.248
I framed Lionheart.
I can frame you, too.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:23.761
It's my word against yours.

01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:25.969
Ooh, actually...

01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.690
<i>And
I'll dart every predator . .</i>

01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:29.251
<i>In Zootopia to keep it that way.</i>

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.280
...it's your word against yours.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:35.083
It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom.

01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.965
<i>Former mayor Dawn Bellwether
is behind bars today...</i>

01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:47.284
<i>guilty of masterminding
the savage attacks...</i>

01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:49.448
<i>that have plagued Zootopia of late.</i>

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.449
<i>Her predecessor, Leodore Lionheart...</i>

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.170
<i>denies any knowledge of her plot...</i>

01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.641
<i>claiming he was just trying
to protect the city.</i>

01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:58.287
<i>Did I falsely imprison those animals?</i>

01:32:58.480 --> 01:32:59.686
<i>Well, yes. Yes, I did.</i>

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.849
<i>It was a classic
"doing the wrong thing...</i>

01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.650
<i>"for the right reason" kind of a deal.</i>

01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.530
<i>In related news, doctors say...</i>

01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.961
<i>the Night Howler antidote
is proving effective...</i>

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:10.965
<i>in rehabilitating
the afflicted predators.</i>

01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:15.240
Emmitt.

01:33:15.600 --> 01:33:17.967
Oh, Emmitt.

01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:22.767
Thank you.

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.370
<i>When I was a kid...</i>

01:33:27.600 --> 01:33:31.161
<i>...I thought Zootopia
was this perfect place.</i>

01:33:31.360 --> 01:33:35.809
<i>Where everyone got along
and anyone could be anything.</i>

01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:38.240
<i>Turns out...</i>

01:33:38.400 --> 01:33:40.120
<i>real life's a little bit
more complicated...</i>

01:33:40.200 --> 01:33:42.851
<i>than a slogan on a bumper sticker</i>

01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:44.769
<i>Real life is messy.</i>

01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:50.162
<i>We all have limitations.
We all make mistakes.</i>

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:52.369
<i>Which means, hey, glass half-full...</i>

01:33:52.480 --> 01:33:54.767
<i>we all have a lot in common.</i>

01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.731
<i>And the more we try
to understand one another...</i>

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:00.850
<i>the more exceptional
each of us will be.</i>

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:03.683
<i>But we have to try.</i>

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.566
<i>So, no matter what type
of animal you are...</i>

01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:09.210
<i>from the biggest elephant...</i>

01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:12.731
<i>to our first fox...</i>

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:18.051
<i>I implore you... Try.</i>

01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:21.687
<i>Try to make the world a better place.</i>

01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:24.367
<i>Look inside yourself...</i>

01:34:24.560 --> 01:34:26.210
<i>and recognize that change...</i>

01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.968
<i>starts with you.</i>

01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:31.885
<i>It starts with me.</i>

01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:36.202
<i>It starts with all of us.</i>

01:34:44.480 --> 01:34:47.290
All right. All right, enough! Shut it!

01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:51.326
We have some new recruits
with us this morning...

01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:52.721
including our first fox.

01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.885
Who cares?

01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:56.246
Huh, you should have your own line...

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.401
of inspirational greeting cards, sir.

01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:58.801
Shut your mouth, Wilde.

01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:00.850
Assignments.

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:03.560
Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato...

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:05.571
Tundratown SWAT.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.888
Snarlov, Higgins, Wolfard...

01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:09.929
undercover.

01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:12.606
Hopps, Wilde.

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.165
Parking duty.

01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:16.004
Dismissed.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:17.924
Just kidding!

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:19.764
We have reports of a street racer...

01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:21.251
tearing up Savannah Central.

01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.840
<i>Find him, shut him down.</i>

01:35:24.280 --> 01:35:26.726
So, are all rabbits bad drivers...

01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:27.961
or is it just you?

01:35:29.960 --> 01:35:31.166
Oops. Sorry.

01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:33.964
Sly bunny.

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:35.481
Dumb fox.

01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:37.529
You know you love me.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:39.444
Do I know that?

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.488
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:58.248
Sir, you were going 115 miles per hour.

01:35:58.360 --> 01:35:59.964
I hope you have a good explanation.

01:36:01.720 --> 01:36:02.767
Flash?

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.962
Flash? Hundred yard dash?

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.926
Nick.

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.281
<i>Good evening,
Zootopia!</i>

01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.767
<i>Come on, everybody.
Put your paws up!</i>

01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:20.162
<i>I messed up tonight</i>

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.084
<i>I lost another fight</i>

01:36:22.320 --> 01:36:25.642
<i>Lost to myself
But I'll just start again</i>

01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.002
<i>I keep falling down</i>

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:30.328
<i>I keep on hitting the ground</i>

01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:33.763
<i>But I always get up now
To see what's next</i>

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.163
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.325
<i>Till I reach the end
And then I'll start again</i>

01:36:42.600 --> 01:36:46.810
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.607
<i>I want to try even though
I could fail</i>

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:54.490
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:59.210
<i>Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again</i>

01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.325
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:07.161
<i>I want to try even though
I could fail</i>

01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:10.964
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:13.010
<i>Try everything</i>

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.249
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:17.330
<i>Try everything</i>

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.130
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:37:20.040 --> 01:37:21.530
<i>Try everything</i>

01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.165
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:27.440
<i>Put your paws
in the air. Come on!</i>

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:34.851
<i>Look how far you've come</i>

01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:36.889
<i>You filled your heart with love</i>

01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:41.091
<i>Baby, you've done enough
Take a deep breath</i>

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:45.251
<i>Don't beat yourself up
No need to run so fast</i>

01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:49.650
<i>Sometimes we come last
But we did our best</i>

01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.322
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:57.201
<i>Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again</i>

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:01.371
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

01:38:01.600 --> 01:38:03.170
<i>I want to try</i>

01:38:03.400 --> 01:38:05.289
<i>Even though I could fail</i>

01:38:06.560 --> 01:38:08.961
<i>I won't give up
No, I won't give in</i>

01:38:09.880 --> 01:38:13.885
<i>Till I reach the end
Then I'll start again</i>

01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:18.290
<i>No, I won't leave
I want to try everything</i>

01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:23.281
<i>I want to try even though
I could fail</i>

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:31.048
<i>I'll keep on making those new mistakes</i>

01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:39.847
<i>I'll keep on making them every day</i>

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.130
<i>Those new mistakes</i>

01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.683
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:48.850
<i>Try everything</i>

01:38:48.960 --> 01:38:50.724
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!</i>

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:53.010

<i>Come on!</i>

01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:11.691
<i>Shake your tails with me. Come on!</i>

01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.120
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:21.965
<i>I'll keep on making
those new mistakes</i>

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:33.602
