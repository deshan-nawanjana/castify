1
00:01:10.882 --> 00:01:12.007
Doctor's log.

2
00:01:12.098 --> 00:01:15.211
It's day 243 in this...

3
00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:17.425
Portobello purgatory.

4
00:01:18.257 --> 00:01:20.674
My only companion is a rock I named stone.

5
00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.527
The question is,
for whom am I narrating this?

6
00:01:29.657 --> 00:01:33.149
It seems I've become a featured player
in the theater of the absurd.

7
00:01:33.257 --> 00:01:36.549
Marooned in deep space
by that wretched blue rodent.

8
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:40.968
But it's all good, thanks to a breathable
atmosphere and my supreme intellect,

9
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.282
sharpened against the only competitor
savvy enough to bring it.

10
00:01:44.283 --> 00:01:45.965
Chanterelle to d4.

11
00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:50.539
I've been striving to make fungi
into a functional drink of choice...

12
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.757
Mushroom coffee.

13
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.336
With limited...

14
00:01:57.218 --> 00:01:58.625
Limited...

15
00:02:00.095 --> 00:02:01.553
Limited...

16
00:02:02.328 --> 00:02:03.572
Success.

17
00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:09.968
But today, day 243,

18
00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:13.257
has brought a new optimism
to my most pressing endeavor...

19
00:02:13.696 --> 00:02:18.235
Planetus exodus to returnicus
and kick blue butticus.

20
00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.840
If my calculations are correct,

21
00:02:26.842 --> 00:02:29.578
and there's no reason to say "if"
because they always are...

22
00:02:30.956 --> 00:02:34.748
This quill is going to power
my masterpiece.

23
00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.424
Let's light this candle...

24
00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:41.852
And see who comes a-knockin'.

25
00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.968
Greetings!

26
00:03:56.065 --> 00:03:57.760
Klaatu barada nikto.

27
00:04:08.253 --> 00:04:10.324
Agent stone?
Now!

28
00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:21.994
Thank you, stone.

29
00:04:23.465 --> 00:04:28.197
It's time to say goodbye
to this piece-of-shiitake planet!

30
00:04:53.197 --> 00:04:54.987
Where did you get that?

31
00:04:58.897 --> 00:05:01.846
From a little blue menace
on the planet called earth.

32
00:05:04.132 --> 00:05:06.340
I'd be happy to show you the way.

33
00:05:41.191 --> 00:05:42.442
They're still on us.

34
00:05:43.332 --> 00:05:44.499
This'll slow 'em down.

35
00:06:11.322 --> 00:06:14.094
Watch out. Excuse me.
Pardon me. Coming through.

36
00:06:15.162 --> 00:06:17.556
Good evening, gentlemen.
Mind if I drive?

37
00:06:19.303 --> 00:06:20.678
Better buckle up.

38
00:06:28.597 --> 00:06:30.235
How we doing back there?

39
00:06:31.257 --> 00:06:32.848
And now this way.

40
00:06:41.915 --> 00:06:44.853
I'm sorry.
I don't speak duct tape.

41
00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:47.507
- What the heck are you?
- Fear not, citizen.

42
00:06:47.509 --> 00:06:51.588
I am the hero you need
and the hero you deserve.

43
00:06:51.674 --> 00:06:54.132
The blue dawn that banishes the darkest...

44
00:06:54.191 --> 00:06:55.358
Holy crap!

45
00:06:59.613 --> 00:07:02.596
Don't worry.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

46
00:07:07.502 --> 00:07:09.014
- What are those?
- Bombs. Bombs.

47
00:07:09.015 --> 00:07:10.639
They're bombs!
Those are bombs!

48
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.850
Relax. They're not even lit.

49
00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:16.046
So I'll say again, nobody's gonna get...

50
00:07:17.424 --> 00:07:19.491
I was wrong!
We're all gonna die!

51
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.553
Why aren't you slowing down?

52
00:07:23.554 --> 00:07:25.516
That would require brakes.

53
00:07:27.686 --> 00:07:30.139
It's hot. Hot, hot, hot!
Hot, hot, hot!

54
00:07:30.141 --> 00:07:31.591
Why don't you just let
the police handle this?

55
00:07:31.593 --> 00:07:35.125
Because that's not what heroes do.

56
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.180
Thank you very much.
Please hold your applause.

57
00:07:44.848 --> 00:07:47.547
Do you hear that?
There's one bomb left.

58
00:07:50.086 --> 00:07:53.211
- Did you check under the seat?
- Of course I checked under the seat!

59
00:07:54.758 --> 00:07:56.425
You are terrible at this!

60
00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.114
You know what?

61
00:07:57.115 --> 00:07:59.755
Your negative attitude
is not helping anyone.

62
00:08:00.031 --> 00:08:01.805
It's in your spiky things!

63
00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:05.524
I can never find anything in here.

64
00:08:06.797 --> 00:08:09.091
Drained it from downtown!

65
00:08:10.183 --> 00:08:13.180
See? I told you
nobody would get hurt.

66
00:08:15.598 --> 00:08:17.524
Holy sherbet!

67
00:08:19.216 --> 00:08:20.695
Oh, hello.

68
00:08:20.696 --> 00:08:23.516
Don't panic.
This is only a drill.

69
00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:09.291
- Come here!
- No need to thank me, citizens.

70
00:09:09.383 --> 00:09:12.008
All in a night's work for...

71
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:14.260
Blue justice!

72
00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:17.180
You're a terrible hero!

73
00:09:28.929 --> 00:09:31.500
- Morning, Wade!
- Morning, Sonic!

74
00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:41.828
Good morning, green hills!

75
00:10:00.322 --> 00:10:01.405
Come on.

76
00:10:24.503 --> 00:10:25.503
Sonic.

77
00:10:25.988 --> 00:10:27.894
I miss you, longclaw.

78
00:10:28.398 --> 00:10:30.245
I'm trying to make you proud.

79
00:10:39.278 --> 00:10:43.029
And now for a little shut-eye.

80
00:10:47.234 --> 00:10:48.942
Ozzy, morning breath!

81
00:10:48.967 --> 00:10:51.286
Sonic. Are you still in bed?

82
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:53.779
You're supposed to meet Tom, remember?

83
00:10:55.513 --> 00:10:59.138
All right, all right, I'm up!
I'm up.

84
00:11:00.573 --> 00:11:01.864
What a day.

85
00:11:04.404 --> 00:11:06.099
Thanks for coming out, bud.

86
00:11:06.895 --> 00:11:09.932
I feel like you and me,
we haven't had much time together lately.

87
00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:14.633
How's it going over there?
You getting any bites?

88
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:24.133
I can't swim!
Help!

89
00:11:24.142 --> 00:11:26.396
If I die, don't look in my closet!

90
00:11:26.398 --> 00:11:29.065
Hey, hey, you're good.
You're all right. Come on.

91
00:11:29.966 --> 00:11:32.693
- It's freezing.
- All right, okay. Take it easy.

92
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:36.560
You're good. Okay.

93
00:11:40.008 --> 00:11:42.883
But now that you've had a nap and a bath...

94
00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:47.982
I went up to your room last night
to bring you some new comics and...

95
00:11:51.567 --> 00:11:53.106
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

96
00:11:53.107 --> 00:11:54.226
I wouldn't come any closer,

97
00:11:54.227 --> 00:11:57.425
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

98
00:11:57.427 --> 00:11:58.898
Oh, no. Oh, no.

99
00:11:59.450 --> 00:12:01.714
I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here quick!

100
00:12:01.716 --> 00:12:03.630
Oh, no, here comes another one!

101
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.133
Go. Now. Save yourself.

102
00:12:06.135 --> 00:12:07.572
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop right there.

103
00:12:07.573 --> 00:12:08.925
I wouldn't come any closer,

104
00:12:08.927 --> 00:12:12.077
because this little hedgehog
had way too many chili dogs.

105
00:12:12.078 --> 00:12:13.474
Oh, no. Oh, no.

106
00:12:14.096 --> 00:12:16.185
I'm so embarrassed.
Get out of here...

107
00:12:16.383 --> 00:12:18.357
I knew I should've used real farts.

108
00:12:21.258 --> 00:12:22.974
- How many times are we gonna do this?
- What?

109
00:12:22.981 --> 00:12:25.637
Cast your line and not catch anything?
Seems like a billion.

110
00:12:25.638 --> 00:12:27.341
I think you know what I'm talking about.

111
00:12:27.933 --> 00:12:30.433
The lying.
The sneaking out.

112
00:12:30.492 --> 00:12:32.020
The pretending to be Batman.

113
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:35.021
- Blue justice, trademark pending.
- Whatever. You're being reckless.

114
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:37.050
Not this conversation again.

115
00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:39.013
Hey. It's no fun for me, either.

116
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:41.504
But if you keep being irresponsible,
we're gonna keep having this conversation.

117
00:12:41.505 --> 00:12:44.035
How is it irresponsible to use my powers?

118
00:12:44.036 --> 00:12:47.008
Sonic, you destroyed an entire city block!

119
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.927
That block was already messed up.
Who cares?

120
00:12:49.929 --> 00:12:53.606
Look, I stopped a robbery.
I was a hero.

121
00:12:53.607 --> 00:12:56.919
No, you put people in danger
and that's not what a hero does.

122
00:13:00.008 --> 00:13:02.185
You're supposed to be my friend.

123
00:13:02.224 --> 00:13:03.911
Stop trying to be my dad.

124
00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:10.515
I can take care of myself.

125
00:13:10.591 --> 00:13:15.175
Sonic, taking care of yourself
is not what being a hero's all about.

126
00:13:15.328 --> 00:13:17.693
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

127
00:13:18.675 --> 00:13:22.193
And right now, whether you want to hear
this or not, you are still just a kid.

128
00:13:22.675 --> 00:13:26.175
You got some more growing up to do
before you're ready to be the big hero.

129
00:13:27.214 --> 00:13:28.714
But trust me when I tell you,

130
00:13:28.716 --> 00:13:31.263
there will come a time
when your powers will be needed.

131
00:13:33.318 --> 00:13:35.482
But you don't choose that moment.

132
00:13:35.956 --> 00:13:37.779
That moment chooses you.

133
00:13:39.508 --> 00:13:40.758
Look at you.

134
00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:43.419
Look at that.
I just got goose bumps.

135
00:13:43.675 --> 00:13:45.425
Wait a second.
Did you steal that from Oprah?

136
00:13:45.427 --> 00:13:48.286
No, sir.
That is a wachowski family special.

137
00:13:48.633 --> 00:13:52.872
Came from my dad,
in this very boat, on this very lake.

138
00:13:53.883 --> 00:13:56.489
He would always try and steer me
in the right direction.

139
00:13:57.255 --> 00:13:59.695
And that's what maddie and
I have always tried to do with you.

140
00:14:00.508 --> 00:14:03.888
So, until your moment arrives,

141
00:14:04.695 --> 00:14:07.112
I want you to work on
being a little more responsible.

142
00:14:08.633 --> 00:14:09.716
Comprende?

143
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:11.800
Comprende.

144
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:13.883
High five on it.

145
00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:18.301
Yeah! Donut lord and the blue blur
are back at it again!

146
00:14:18.302 --> 00:14:19.341
Hang on.

147
00:14:20.075 --> 00:14:21.075
Speedboat!

148
00:14:25.218 --> 00:14:26.489
Sonic!

149
00:14:28.548 --> 00:14:32.298
How excited are you,
going to Hawaii with me?

150
00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:33.669
Oh, yeah!

151
00:14:36.817 --> 00:14:40.304
Welcome to Sonic air,
the fastest way to travel.

152
00:14:40.341 --> 00:14:42.364
Now boarding groups one and two.

153
00:14:44.258 --> 00:14:46.773
Sonic, this is so fun!

154
00:14:46.774 --> 00:14:49.598
I'm sorry, ma'am, you're group three.
Please wait your turn.

155
00:14:49.599 --> 00:14:52.879
- Anyone from groups one and two? Nobody?
- Just let him get it out of his system.

156
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.388
Okay, then everybody else right this way.

157
00:14:55.633 --> 00:14:56.758
Thank you.

158
00:15:01.675 --> 00:15:02.800
And you, sir?

159
00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:05.966
Terrible shirt detected.

160
00:15:06.050 --> 00:15:07.050
There we go.

161
00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:11.138
Okay, you're free to go. Enjoy your trip.
Bye-bye now.

162
00:15:11.425 --> 00:15:12.425
Okay.

163
00:15:13.653 --> 00:15:14.513
Bring it in.

164
00:15:14.514 --> 00:15:17.591
Tom, I'm about to be
hedgehog of the house for the first time.

165
00:15:17.675 --> 00:15:20.379
I think I'm a little mature
to hug you goodbye.

166
00:15:20.380 --> 00:15:22.024
Okay, what about a power bump?

167
00:15:22.508 --> 00:15:24.383
- Power bump?
- Yes, power bump.

168
00:15:24.411 --> 00:15:25.671
That's more like it.

169
00:15:25.958 --> 00:15:27.794
- Wachowski!
- Wachowski!

170
00:15:28.008 --> 00:15:30.552
Okay, use this one to get back home.

171
00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:34.488
All right, we're off.
Be good.

172
00:15:34.596 --> 00:15:36.496
Yes.
You have our number.

173
00:15:36.497 --> 00:15:37.723
Sorry! Can't hear you!

174
00:15:37.724 --> 00:15:39.495
You're traveling through a
cross-dimensional portal!

175
00:15:39.497 --> 00:15:40.911
- Miss you already!
- Okay?

176
00:15:40.912 --> 00:15:42.747
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!

177
00:15:44.344 --> 00:15:46.583
Okay, it's 48 hours until they come back.

178
00:15:46.584 --> 00:15:50.700
We've got TV channels, streaming channels,
a house full of food and no supervision.

179
00:15:51.925 --> 00:15:53.008
Let's do this.

180
00:17:21.112 --> 00:17:23.653
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

181
00:17:23.767 --> 00:17:24.892
I found him!

182
00:17:25.172 --> 00:17:27.297
I just hope I'm not too late.

183
00:17:45.690 --> 00:17:46.714
He's close.

184
00:17:46.716 --> 00:17:49.180
I just need a way to reach him
without being spotted.

185
00:17:51.349 --> 00:17:53.922
Standard human transport.
Perfect.

186
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:07.446
Oh, boy.

187
00:18:11.982 --> 00:18:14.078
Aloha!

188
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.515
- How's it going, bud?
- Oh, you know.

189
00:18:16.516 --> 00:18:19.383
Just a quiet night at home,
settling in with a good book.

190
00:18:19.393 --> 00:18:22.352
- And you? What's up with you?
- I was just calling to say we're here.

191
00:18:22.466 --> 00:18:25.640
But now every word out of your mouth
is making me suspicious.

192
00:18:25.641 --> 00:18:26.281
What?

193
00:18:26.282 --> 00:18:30.216
You got to relax, buddy.
You're at the four seasons oahu.

194
00:18:30.225 --> 00:18:32.750
Have a Mai Tai.
Enjoy some time with your wife.

195
00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:34.961
Get sunburned somewhere embarrassing.

196
00:18:35.042 --> 00:18:37.214
This weekend is about you.

197
00:18:37.216 --> 00:18:40.070
You know what? You're right.
We power-bumped on it.

198
00:18:40.071 --> 00:18:41.359
So whatever it is you're doing,

199
00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.883
I'm sure you can undo it
by the time we get home, yeah?

200
00:18:43.895 --> 00:18:48.860
Exactly! I mean, I am deeply offended
by such accusations!

201
00:18:48.867 --> 00:18:50.390
So, how's Rachel's fiance?

202
00:18:50.466 --> 00:18:53.550
Is he as good-looking in person
as he is in pictures?

203
00:18:55.550 --> 00:18:56.866
Somehow better-looking.

204
00:18:56.867 --> 00:19:00.413
Wow! You're about to be
the third best-looking dude in the family.

205
00:19:00.414 --> 00:19:02.430
But, hey, still on the podium.

206
00:19:03.383 --> 00:19:06.031
All right,
I better go and introduce myself.

207
00:19:06.828 --> 00:19:07.929
Stay out of trouble.

208
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.140
Trouble? Don't worry.
Everything here is completely normal.

209
00:19:12.142 --> 00:19:13.899
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

210
00:19:14.961 --> 00:19:16.727
Hey! I was just
coming over to say hi.

211
00:19:16.735 --> 00:19:19.781
You've got a lot of nerve coming up
in here after what you did to my fiancee.

212
00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:22.813
- Wait. What?
- Totaling her car?

213
00:19:23.175 --> 00:19:25.758
Leaving her tied to a chair?
I should rip you limb from limb.

214
00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:31.408
Oh, my god, look at your face!

215
00:19:31.409 --> 00:19:33.962
Tommy, breathe, baby. Breathe.
I was kidding.

216
00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:36.272
- Hey, man, I was totally kidding.
- Okay.

217
00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.258
- You were kidding.
- Yeah.

218
00:19:39.341 --> 00:19:42.401
I'm sorry. Rachel put me up to it.
It was totally her idea.

219
00:19:43.002 --> 00:19:44.298
That rascal.

220
00:19:44.299 --> 00:19:48.815
Listen, I don't know if you're aware.
Rachel does not care for you at all.

221
00:19:49.133 --> 00:19:50.573
I'm aware. Yeah.

222
00:19:50.977 --> 00:19:53.103
Seriously, bro, you got work to do.

223
00:19:53.217 --> 00:19:54.682
- Hey!
- Hey.

224
00:19:54.683 --> 00:19:57.051
Good to see you!
Thanks for coming, Tom.

225
00:19:57.134 --> 00:19:59.300
- Really glad you came.
- Really?

226
00:20:01.095 --> 00:20:03.050
Great to see you, too.
Congratulations.

227
00:20:03.052 --> 00:20:05.719
I mean, you guys, you guys
seem really happy together.

228
00:20:05.801 --> 00:20:07.792
You know, you're all right,
Thomas wachowski.

229
00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:12.034
- Can we Bury the hatchet?
- I'd love that.

230
00:20:12.035 --> 00:20:13.035
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

231
00:20:13.042 --> 00:20:15.894
- All right, bring it in!
- All right! Great.

232
00:20:16.565 --> 00:20:19.363
And if you screw up my wedding,
I will end you.

233
00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:26.206
All right, ozzy,
it's movie night at casa de Sonic,

234
00:20:26.214 --> 00:20:27.516
and it's your turn to pick.

235
00:20:27.592 --> 00:20:30.134
But I am not watching snow dogs again.

236
00:20:30.217 --> 00:20:33.105
That movie is the worst!

237
00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:37.092
Blackout!

238
00:20:38.456 --> 00:20:40.808
Ozzy.

239
00:20:41.342 --> 00:20:43.230
Sorry, buddy.
Everything's okay.

240
00:20:50.157 --> 00:20:53.548
Excuse me.
We did not order a poltergeist.

241
00:21:03.376 --> 00:21:07.181
If this is the pizza guy,
this is really unprofessional.

242
00:21:25.025 --> 00:21:26.275
Eggman?

243
00:21:29.551 --> 00:21:32.782
Hello, hedgehog.

244
00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:35.051
Did you miss me?

245
00:21:36.426 --> 00:21:40.985
I don't know how you got back,
but you made a big mistake coming here.

246
00:21:40.986 --> 00:21:43.947
Au contraire, mon frere.

247
00:21:44.204 --> 00:21:46.662
The mistake was thinking you'd won.

248
00:21:46.801 --> 00:21:49.301
But that was just a prelude,
an hors d'oeuvre,

249
00:21:49.303 --> 00:21:51.735
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

250
00:21:51.736 --> 00:21:53.095
I get it.

251
00:21:54.551 --> 00:21:56.469
I don't think you do.

252
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:58.058
But you're about to.

253
00:21:58.134 --> 00:22:00.829
And so will that idiot sheriff
and his wife.

254
00:22:03.212 --> 00:22:05.046
And your little dog too!

255
00:22:23.974 --> 00:22:25.141
Pitiful.

256
00:22:25.407 --> 00:22:28.228
What? Who are you?

257
00:22:29.191 --> 00:22:32.540
Where are my manners?

258
00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:36.134
Sonic, meet knuckles.

259
00:22:36.136 --> 00:22:38.430
My new bffae.

260
00:22:38.431 --> 00:22:41.884
Bestest friend forever and ever!

261
00:22:41.975 --> 00:22:45.100
Look, robotnik, I don't care
who you brought to help you.

262
00:22:45.102 --> 00:22:47.032
You're never going to get my power.

263
00:22:47.092 --> 00:22:50.064
Do I look like I need your power?

264
00:23:00.217 --> 00:23:04.694
So nice when diabolical evil
lives up to the hype.

265
00:23:07.507 --> 00:23:09.053
Where is it?

266
00:23:09.334 --> 00:23:12.310
You want it?
Here it comes.

267
00:23:12.311 --> 00:23:17.350
I was expecting more of you.
You're unskilled.

268
00:23:17.735 --> 00:23:19.204
Untrained.

269
00:23:20.207 --> 00:23:23.022
And unworthy!

270
00:23:24.553 --> 00:23:27.764
You forgot one.
Unstoppable.

271
00:23:53.715 --> 00:23:57.527
It is my destiny
to do what my ancestors could not...

272
00:23:57.528 --> 00:24:01.676
To restore the ultimate power
to the home of my people.

273
00:24:02.661 --> 00:24:06.161
Ultimate power?
I don't know what you're talking about.

274
00:24:06.301 --> 00:24:07.871
You've got the wrong guy.

275
00:24:07.886 --> 00:24:09.926
Ultimate power?

276
00:24:10.259 --> 00:24:13.051
Now you're speaking my language.

277
00:24:13.053 --> 00:24:16.301
Don't play dumb with me,
apprentice of longclaw.

278
00:24:16.392 --> 00:24:17.850
You knew longclaw?

279
00:24:17.852 --> 00:24:22.254
Longclaw and her people were
the sworn enemy of my tribe, the echidna.

280
00:24:22.256 --> 00:24:27.410
We fought and died at their hands,
and now you will die at mine.

281
00:24:37.923 --> 00:24:39.982
Come on. Get in!
I'm on your side.

282
00:24:39.983 --> 00:24:42.009
I'm sorry. Who are you?

283
00:24:43.071 --> 00:24:45.201
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

284
00:24:47.753 --> 00:24:49.959
Get us out of here!
Go, go, go, go, go!

285
00:24:53.954 --> 00:24:55.157
He's gone rabid!

286
00:24:56.954 --> 00:24:58.822
Gross! Is he licking it?

287
00:24:59.634 --> 00:25:00.847
See ya!

288
00:25:00.969 --> 00:25:03.493
Make sure to get your shots, eggman!

289
00:25:17.176 --> 00:25:20.884
Wow. Okay. Let me just say
it is an honor to finally meet you, Sonic.

290
00:25:20.886 --> 00:25:22.428
Is it okay if I call you Sonic?

291
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:25.386
Everyone calls me tails.
You're probably wondering why.

292
00:25:25.387 --> 00:25:27.749
Let me guess.
Because of the extra tail?

293
00:25:27.764 --> 00:25:29.957
That's right!
I should've known you'd get that.

294
00:25:29.981 --> 00:25:33.738
Cool. Also, what is going on?
Robotnik's back?

295
00:25:33.739 --> 00:25:36.707
And who is
Clifford the big red rage monster?

296
00:25:36.709 --> 00:25:38.784
That's knuckles, the last of the echidnas

297
00:25:38.785 --> 00:25:41.371
and the most dangerous warrior
in the galaxy.

298
00:25:41.418 --> 00:25:43.667
He's obsessed with finding
the master emerald.

299
00:25:43.668 --> 00:25:45.842
Are you serious?
The master emerald?

300
00:25:45.933 --> 00:25:47.714
That's just a bedtime story.

301
00:25:47.715 --> 00:25:49.254
Well, he believes it's real.

302
00:25:49.285 --> 00:25:51.895
And he must think
you're the key to finding it.

303
00:25:53.715 --> 00:25:55.467
Red light!
Give me the wheel!

304
00:25:55.469 --> 00:25:57.570
- Hey, what are you...
- Move your foot.

305
00:26:05.207 --> 00:26:06.551
I think we lost him.

306
00:26:14.329 --> 00:26:17.168
We did not lose him.
We definitely did not lose him!

307
00:26:22.449 --> 00:26:24.384
I've got an idea.
Do you trust me?

308
00:26:24.467 --> 00:26:26.847
Of course not!
I literally just met you!

309
00:26:26.848 --> 00:26:28.842
- Just let me. Come on!
- What are you doing?

310
00:26:47.873 --> 00:26:49.123
We're flying.

311
00:26:49.809 --> 00:26:52.201
Did your butt just turn into a helicopter?

312
00:26:53.165 --> 00:26:54.998
A butt-copter!

313
00:26:55.529 --> 00:26:58.863
Only Sonic the hedgehog
could come up with something like that.

314
00:27:14.046 --> 00:27:16.397
Foxy move.

315
00:27:17.301 --> 00:27:19.342
You want something done right...

316
00:27:20.696 --> 00:27:23.920
You have to hire someone
you can push around.

317
00:27:25.842 --> 00:27:26.842
All caps.

318
00:27:45.051 --> 00:27:48.778
Doctor, where are you?

319
00:27:55.481 --> 00:27:56.614
Freak.

320
00:28:04.462 --> 00:28:06.540
I, I'm sorry, folks.

321
00:28:06.548 --> 00:28:09.267
I have to close early.
Everybody out!

322
00:28:09.465 --> 00:28:12.507
Everybody out.
Thank you for visiting the mean bean.

323
00:28:12.509 --> 00:28:14.707
All right, good night.
Good night.

324
00:28:33.811 --> 00:28:35.139
He's back.

325
00:28:36.467 --> 00:28:38.826
He's back!

326
00:29:33.212 --> 00:29:35.618
That's more like it.

327
00:29:36.467 --> 00:29:39.470
I've been re-hatched!

328
00:29:51.123 --> 00:29:55.357
So, my massively metacarpaled friend,

329
00:29:55.366 --> 00:29:56.342
you mentioned...

330
00:29:56.343 --> 00:30:00.684
Ultimate power.

331
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:01.990
Back at the house?

332
00:30:02.256 --> 00:30:03.693
The master emerald?

333
00:30:03.694 --> 00:30:04.933
It does not concern you.

334
00:30:05.016 --> 00:30:08.016
I got you off that planet
and you brought me to the hedgehog.

335
00:30:08.161 --> 00:30:10.286
We have no more use for each other.

336
00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:12.983
Well, I hate to be a contrarian, but...

337
00:30:13.551 --> 00:30:14.676
I think we might.

338
00:30:16.295 --> 00:30:18.633
You think these machines
are a match for me?

339
00:30:18.709 --> 00:30:22.576
I will shatter them
like the bones from a fallen...

340
00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:24.444
They are stairs.

341
00:30:29.876 --> 00:30:34.420
You see, earth is my turf, g.

342
00:30:34.551 --> 00:30:37.301
If you don't know how to floss,
you'll be lost without me.

343
00:30:37.303 --> 00:30:40.248
I understand nothing
of what you just said.

344
00:30:40.255 --> 00:30:44.524
I help you retrieve the emerald,
and you use it to...

345
00:30:45.668 --> 00:30:51.350
Destroy the hedgehog!

346
00:30:51.352 --> 00:30:53.466
You're suggesting an alliance.

347
00:30:53.467 --> 00:30:57.530
Around here we simply
grip each other's hands tightly.

348
00:31:02.717 --> 00:31:06.560
You truculent space bumpkin!

349
00:31:06.561 --> 00:31:09.100
You've crushed my favorite hand!

350
00:31:09.259 --> 00:31:11.522
Really?
My hand is uninjured.

351
00:31:12.592 --> 00:31:14.982
But I'm now convinced of your commitment.

352
00:31:14.983 --> 00:31:16.634
"Oh, goody,"

353
00:31:16.717 --> 00:31:20.217
he exclaimed,
while he reset two of his knuckles.

354
00:31:20.227 --> 00:31:22.498
I'm...

355
00:31:22.709 --> 00:31:28.115
Delighted to be on the same team.

356
00:31:35.630 --> 00:31:36.922
Road trip!

357
00:31:37.467 --> 00:31:39.509
I'll let you stick your nose
out the window.

358
00:31:41.717 --> 00:31:43.467
Sonic, where are we?

359
00:31:43.632 --> 00:31:46.007
Welcome to the Wade cave.

360
00:31:46.009 --> 00:31:49.051
Which is something
I hope to someday say to a woman.

361
00:31:49.134 --> 00:31:50.801
A woman who's not my mom.

362
00:31:51.209 --> 00:31:52.924
Wade, focus.

363
00:31:52.926 --> 00:31:56.634
We need to figure out why knuckles thinks
I'm the key to finding the master emerald.

364
00:31:56.717 --> 00:31:58.634
And why did he mention longclaw?

365
00:31:59.498 --> 00:32:01.889
There must be a connection.

366
00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.467
Wait a minute.
There is.

367
00:32:04.009 --> 00:32:07.926
Look. There's an emerald symbol
on the map longclaw gave me.

368
00:32:08.006 --> 00:32:09.884
I never knew what it meant before.

369
00:32:10.592 --> 00:32:12.259
Something's happening.

370
00:32:25.442 --> 00:32:26.817
Longclaw?

371
00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:28.361
Hello, Sonic.

372
00:32:28.517 --> 00:32:31.892
If you're watching this,
then something has happened to me.

373
00:32:31.968 --> 00:32:34.802
And I pray
you've made it to earth unharmed.

374
00:32:35.384 --> 00:32:39.675
This world has been chosen
for a very important reason.

375
00:32:39.677 --> 00:32:43.833
It's the secret location
of the master emerald.

376
00:32:45.427 --> 00:32:49.474
The emerald has the power
to turn thoughts into reality.

377
00:32:49.896 --> 00:32:52.865
Like the stay puft marshmallow man
from ghostbusters.

378
00:32:52.872 --> 00:32:56.934
In the wrong hands it could threaten
all life in the universe.

379
00:32:57.010 --> 00:32:59.927
Protecting the emerald was my sacred duty.

380
00:33:00.010 --> 00:33:03.982
And now I must pass
that responsibility to you.

381
00:33:04.802 --> 00:33:07.468
This is my moment.

382
00:33:07.692 --> 00:33:11.505
Follow the map, find the emerald,
and keep it safe.

383
00:33:11.635 --> 00:33:13.177
My dear Sonic,

384
00:33:13.267 --> 00:33:16.544
you have a heart
like no creature I've ever known.

385
00:33:16.851 --> 00:33:18.583
I love you so much.

386
00:33:20.169 --> 00:33:21.385
Goodbye.

387
00:33:23.075 --> 00:33:24.841
No, no, no, wait.

388
00:33:31.677 --> 00:33:33.857
I won't let you down, longclaw.

389
00:33:35.591 --> 00:33:38.758
So is that you, your dad?

390
00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.958
What?

391
00:33:40.302 --> 00:33:41.302
No?

392
00:33:42.052 --> 00:33:45.199
According to this map,
the first clue is in Siberia.

393
00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:47.341
It's a compass
that will lead to the emerald.

394
00:33:47.424 --> 00:33:50.341
And with knuckles already here,
it's a race.

395
00:33:50.343 --> 00:33:51.638
Knuckles?

396
00:33:52.093 --> 00:33:53.871
I knew a kid in middle school
named knuckles.

397
00:33:53.872 --> 00:33:55.802
Could fit his whole fist in his mouth.

398
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.892
If this is the same knuckles,
we are screwed.

399
00:33:59.894 --> 00:34:02.458
This knuckles, that knuckles.
It doesn't matter.

400
00:34:02.523 --> 00:34:04.190
We're gonna get there first.

401
00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.262
What do you mean, "we"?

402
00:34:09.263 --> 00:34:10.271
You're coming with me.

403
00:34:10.818 --> 00:34:11.818
No, no, no, no, no.

404
00:34:11.885 --> 00:34:15.254
I just came here to warn you.
I'm not a field guy.

405
00:34:15.255 --> 00:34:19.341
Don't worry. I got your back.
I won't let anything happen to you.

406
00:34:20.468 --> 00:34:24.685
It's a power bump.
On earth, it means an unbreakable promise.

407
00:34:24.692 --> 00:34:27.341
Okay, I'm in.

408
00:34:42.678 --> 00:34:45.398
Doctor. It's really you.

409
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:47.804
You look different.

410
00:34:48.177 --> 00:34:51.146
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

411
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:57.675
I knew it. I knew it!
I knew you'd come back, sir.

412
00:34:57.677 --> 00:35:00.382
I never stopped steaming
your Austrian goat's milk.

413
00:35:06.052 --> 00:35:07.385
Could use some mushroom.

414
00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.732
You brought something.

415
00:35:11.192 --> 00:35:14.161
Some kind of space porcupine.

416
00:35:14.468 --> 00:35:17.468
Porcupine?
I am an echidna!

417
00:35:17.552 --> 00:35:20.301
Trained since birth
in all forms of lethal combat,

418
00:35:20.302 --> 00:35:22.614
destined to restore honor to my tribe,

419
00:35:22.615 --> 00:35:26.435
and willing to destroy
anything that gets in my way.

420
00:35:26.927 --> 00:35:28.302
Welcome to the team.

421
00:35:34.510 --> 00:35:36.846
That means he trusts you, stone.

422
00:35:37.052 --> 00:35:40.002
Now let's renovate this dump!

423
00:35:40.427 --> 00:35:42.932
Latte with steamed Austrian goat milk!

424
00:36:03.093 --> 00:36:04.577
Good one. Solid.

425
00:36:11.552 --> 00:36:13.304
- Sorry, fellas.
- That's game!

426
00:36:14.009 --> 00:36:16.015
That's how we do!
That's how we do!

427
00:36:16.017 --> 00:36:19.171
- But are they good at math?
- Teamwork makes the dream work!

428
00:36:19.218 --> 00:36:20.991
Sorry about that, big Tom.

429
00:36:21.185 --> 00:36:23.085
- Are you good?
- All good. Fine.

430
00:36:23.093 --> 00:36:26.467
Hey. Thanks for inviting me out to hang
with you and your groomsmen.

431
00:36:26.468 --> 00:36:28.421
Good quality bonding.

432
00:36:28.423 --> 00:36:29.825
You know, bro,

433
00:36:29.843 --> 00:36:32.343
those guys right there,
they're way more than my groomsmen.

434
00:36:32.427 --> 00:36:33.787
That's my squad.

435
00:36:33.788 --> 00:36:35.592
Never would've made it through life
without 'em.

436
00:36:35.593 --> 00:36:36.802
Get over here!

437
00:36:36.877 --> 00:36:38.702
Yeah, I'm coming! I'm coming!

438
00:36:39.254 --> 00:36:42.240
- I'll catch you later.
- Hey. Yeah!

439
00:36:42.241 --> 00:36:44.553
Let me know if you're ready
for some power yoga.

440
00:36:44.554 --> 00:36:46.704
- You bet.
- Come on, Tommy boy. Let's go.

441
00:36:46.705 --> 00:36:47.364
Let's go.

442
00:36:47.366 --> 00:36:48.510
Don't make me.

443
00:36:49.593 --> 00:36:50.677
What am I doing?

444
00:36:50.679 --> 00:36:51.971
Hey, uncle Tommy!

445
00:36:52.135 --> 00:36:53.850
Hey, girls!

446
00:36:53.851 --> 00:36:55.061
How you do.

447
00:36:55.195 --> 00:36:57.060
- Are those the wedding rings?
- Uh-huh.

448
00:36:57.061 --> 00:36:57.991
May I?

449
00:36:57.992 --> 00:37:01.776
This little ring bearer
has been taking her job very seriously.

450
00:37:01.783 --> 00:37:04.179
- She's been practicing all morning.
- I can see that.

451
00:37:04.181 --> 00:37:06.468
How very responsible of you.

452
00:37:06.470 --> 00:37:08.550
Except aren't there supposed
to be two wedding rings?

453
00:37:08.968 --> 00:37:10.093
Uh-oh.

454
00:37:11.334 --> 00:37:15.210
- Uncle Tommy?
- Hang on. What's going on here?

455
00:37:17.177 --> 00:37:18.609
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

456
00:37:18.616 --> 00:37:19.518
Bye.

457
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:21.116
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

458
00:37:24.085 --> 00:37:26.490
That's right!
Groom in the building!

459
00:37:26.491 --> 00:37:27.999
Look at those guys.

460
00:37:28.225 --> 00:37:30.031
I wish Sonic had that.

461
00:37:30.177 --> 00:37:32.609
- Muscles?
- Control yourself.

462
00:37:33.468 --> 00:37:37.093
No. Buddies.
Wingmen. A squad.

463
00:37:37.327 --> 00:37:41.007
Sonic doesn't have anything like that.
He's flying solo.

464
00:37:41.640 --> 00:37:43.936
Baby, you got to relax.

465
00:37:43.937 --> 00:37:45.709
You're at the four seasons.

466
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:49.295
Have a Mai Tai.
Spend some time with your wife.

467
00:37:49.296 --> 00:37:52.319
That's what he said.
Seriously, his exact words.

468
00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:56.335
See? He's a smart kid.
He'll find his way.

469
00:37:56.726 --> 00:37:59.733
I absolutely cannot find my way.

470
00:37:59.734 --> 00:38:03.523
We are completely, totally,
unequivocally lost.

471
00:38:04.661 --> 00:38:06.215
Sonic, in this weather,

472
00:38:06.216 --> 00:38:09.077
there's no way we're gonna get
any readings on this thing!

473
00:38:09.294 --> 00:38:11.186
- Should we go back?
- No, no, no.

474
00:38:11.187 --> 00:38:14.827
There's a light up ahead.
Maybe we can take shelter in there.

475
00:38:19.968 --> 00:38:21.201
Perfect.

476
00:38:21.202 --> 00:38:24.309
Are you sure about this?
We don't know who's inside.

477
00:38:24.393 --> 00:38:27.643
Don't worry.
On earth, people are very welcoming,

478
00:38:27.645 --> 00:38:31.398
and love taking complete strangers
into their homes.

479
00:39:01.369 --> 00:39:02.369
Run.

480
00:39:04.843 --> 00:39:06.427
Table for two, please!

481
00:39:08.633 --> 00:39:11.115
What would you like to order?

482
00:39:11.116 --> 00:39:12.820
Two beef stews, please.

483
00:39:17.935 --> 00:39:21.241
- Where'd you get all these cool gadgets?
- I invented 'em.

484
00:39:21.302 --> 00:39:23.218
That's kinda my thing.

485
00:39:23.302 --> 00:39:26.156
In fact,
my inventions are how I discovered you.

486
00:39:26.593 --> 00:39:29.272
Remember that night at the baseball field?

487
00:39:29.273 --> 00:39:32.718
Your energy blast reached all the way
to my home planet.

488
00:39:32.802 --> 00:39:37.427
I saw you save your whole village
from that crazy mustache guy.

489
00:39:37.517 --> 00:39:40.725
Wait, so you've been watching me
this whole time?

490
00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:42.423
Even in the shower?

491
00:39:42.796 --> 00:39:44.408
That's a trick question.

492
00:39:44.410 --> 00:39:46.819
Sonic the hedgehog prefers bubble baths.

493
00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:48.240
Man, you're good!

494
00:39:48.241 --> 00:39:50.635
When I learned knuckles was on your trail,

495
00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.675
I knew I couldn't just sit back
and watch anymore.

496
00:39:53.677 --> 00:39:55.413
I had to come warn you.

497
00:39:56.570 --> 00:39:58.350
What? Hang on one sec.

498
00:39:58.351 --> 00:39:59.921
Donut lord is checking in.

499
00:40:01.809 --> 00:40:05.687
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

500
00:40:05.843 --> 00:40:07.754
Dot, dot, dot.

501
00:40:08.302 --> 00:40:10.427
Dot, dot, dot.

502
00:40:11.184 --> 00:40:13.201
Dot, dot, dot.

503
00:40:13.249 --> 00:40:15.101
Dot, dot, dot.

504
00:40:15.343 --> 00:40:17.927
Dot, dot, dot.

505
00:40:18.427 --> 00:40:19.427
Doctor,

506
00:40:20.427 --> 00:40:23.148
why are we working with this imbecile?

507
00:40:24.093 --> 00:40:29.038
Because that simpleminded space trash
is the key to something extraordinary.

508
00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:32.523
Something to help you get revenge
on the hedgehog.

509
00:40:32.635 --> 00:40:34.202
Think bigger, stone.

510
00:40:34.427 --> 00:40:37.760
The emerald he seeks
could power my wildest designs.

511
00:40:37.843 --> 00:40:40.413
My genius wouldn't just
be recognized on earth.

512
00:40:40.421 --> 00:40:43.420
It would spread virally
to every corner of the galaxy,

513
00:40:43.421 --> 00:40:47.031
allowing me to harness
all the negative forces of the universe

514
00:40:47.434 --> 00:40:49.684
and commune with darkness itself.

515
00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.656
Wow. That sounds big.

516
00:40:52.802 --> 00:40:55.968
It's been on my vision board for years.
It's the law of attraction.

517
00:40:56.052 --> 00:40:57.531
Didn't you see the secret?

518
00:40:58.718 --> 00:41:00.764
Kaplooey!

519
00:41:00.835 --> 00:41:01.877
Kaplooey.

520
00:41:01.968 --> 00:41:05.350
"Another boring night at home."

521
00:41:05.351 --> 00:41:07.267
The hedgehog has returned home!

522
00:41:07.343 --> 00:41:10.976
Falsa.
Which is Latin for "wrong-o."

523
00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:16.038
According to my worldwide network
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

524
00:41:16.427 --> 00:41:17.960
all the way

525
00:41:18.635 --> 00:41:22.984
from the majestic hinterlands
of eastern Siberia.

526
00:41:23.643 --> 00:41:26.960
He's a long-distance liar!

527
00:41:31.218 --> 00:41:33.765
Yeah, there's more where that came from.

528
00:41:35.802 --> 00:41:38.406
Tiny magic hedgehog destroyed.

529
00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:41.476
Now let's begin our quest.

530
00:41:44.177 --> 00:41:45.343
Wait.

531
00:41:45.481 --> 00:41:48.366
What about your Minion?
The goat milker.

532
00:41:48.592 --> 00:41:50.925
There's no room on the ship for stone.

533
00:41:50.927 --> 00:41:53.718
I say we ditch him,
ghost him, blow him off.

534
00:41:53.898 --> 00:41:55.148
Dishonor!

535
00:41:56.177 --> 00:41:59.234
"Dis" is how I roll.

536
00:42:07.226 --> 00:42:10.421
I'm sorry, but I asked for the beef stew.

537
00:42:10.499 --> 00:42:13.635
Your breath smells like goat poop.

538
00:42:14.369 --> 00:42:16.241
What did you say?

539
00:42:20.304 --> 00:42:21.718
What's going on?

540
00:42:22.343 --> 00:42:25.210
Maybe they think it's my birthday?

541
00:42:25.799 --> 00:42:29.341
Don't worry, I'll take care of this.
Okay, everybody, take it easy.

542
00:42:29.343 --> 00:42:31.385
I'm sure there's
a perfectly good explanation

543
00:42:31.387 --> 00:42:34.031
for whatever my friend said or did.

544
00:42:34.537 --> 00:42:35.634
Stand back.

545
00:42:35.843 --> 00:42:37.260
I just farted.

546
00:42:42.708 --> 00:42:43.881
Meow?

547
00:42:43.882 --> 00:42:46.210
Throw these monsters in the fire!

548
00:42:49.885 --> 00:42:53.382
Oh, no, no. Come on, guys.
Take it easy. Let's talk this through.

549
00:42:53.553 --> 00:42:54.991
Let's talk this through!

550
00:42:56.226 --> 00:42:58.632
Come on, come on.
Scanning siberian customs.

551
00:42:59.124 --> 00:43:02.510
- There's got to be something in here.
- Tails, whatever you're doing, do it fast.

552
00:43:02.702 --> 00:43:03.635
I think I got it!

553
00:43:03.718 --> 00:43:05.927
Pivonka!
Pivonka!

554
00:43:06.202 --> 00:43:08.515
Pivonka!

555
00:43:35.802 --> 00:43:36.802
Da.

556
00:43:37.343 --> 00:43:38.599
Pivonka!

557
00:43:40.177 --> 00:43:42.520
Tails, what's a "pivonka"?

558
00:43:42.521 --> 00:43:45.426
It's a siberian custom
to resolve disputes.

559
00:43:45.427 --> 00:43:48.185
If we win, they let us go.
If we lose...

560
00:43:53.722 --> 00:43:55.682
Okay, we have to grab the
map and get out of here.

561
00:43:56.065 --> 00:43:56.925
Where's the map?

562
00:43:56.927 --> 00:43:59.819
Oh, no. I left it on the table!
Look!

563
00:44:07.468 --> 00:44:08.593
What?

564
00:44:31.788 --> 00:44:34.671
Oh, my god, it's a dance fight.

565
00:44:36.273 --> 00:44:38.052
Sonic, what do we do?

566
00:44:38.143 --> 00:44:40.773
We dance and get that map.

567
00:44:42.562 --> 00:44:43.671
Here we go.

568
00:44:46.070 --> 00:44:48.410
Okay, now let's do.
No, we're gonna go...

569
00:44:55.397 --> 00:44:56.686
Okay.

570
00:45:05.394 --> 00:45:09.436
Okay, this is not going well.
Channing Tatum makes it look so easy.

571
00:45:09.511 --> 00:45:11.256
Wait, Sonic. Look!

572
00:45:16.027 --> 00:45:18.238
The map!
Come on, let's grab it!

573
00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:23.370
You want?

574
00:45:23.636 --> 00:45:25.066
Come get.

575
00:45:25.824 --> 00:45:26.824
Freaks!

576
00:45:27.553 --> 00:45:29.002
Freaks!

577
00:45:29.003 --> 00:45:31.188
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

578
00:45:31.303 --> 00:45:33.469
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

579
00:45:33.471 --> 00:45:35.760
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

580
00:45:35.761 --> 00:45:37.392
Freaks! Freaks! Freaks!

581
00:45:37.394 --> 00:45:39.969
What's wrong, tails?
Come on. I need you!

582
00:45:40.053 --> 00:45:42.969
I can't do this, Sonic.
I'm not brave like you.

583
00:45:43.053 --> 00:45:45.719
My gadget got us in this mess,
and I lost your map,

584
00:45:45.729 --> 00:45:48.191
and we're gonna get tossed into a fire!

585
00:45:52.901 --> 00:45:54.816
New deejay coming in.

586
00:45:57.719 --> 00:45:59.719
Come on, pal.
I got an idea.

587
00:46:00.003 --> 00:46:01.847
They called us freaks,

588
00:46:02.441 --> 00:46:04.191
so let's get freaky.

589
00:46:04.644 --> 00:46:07.074
Just follow my moves.
You'll be fine.

590
00:46:35.101 --> 00:46:37.907
All right!
Backup dancers!

591
00:46:42.352 --> 00:46:43.586
Here we go!

592
00:47:04.823 --> 00:47:07.597
There's a lot of me up here!

593
00:47:12.678 --> 00:47:15.253
I love pivonka!

594
00:47:17.894 --> 00:47:21.699
And big dismount!

595
00:47:23.519 --> 00:47:24.519
Yeah!

596
00:47:28.178 --> 00:47:29.675
I'll take that.

597
00:47:35.011 --> 00:47:36.270
We did it!

598
00:47:36.307 --> 00:47:39.636
That was amazing!
Way to go, tails.

599
00:47:48.248 --> 00:47:52.941
Wow. Only Sonic the hedgehog
could win a dance battle that epic.

600
00:47:52.948 --> 00:47:54.185
Well, stick with me, pal.

601
00:47:54.187 --> 00:47:58.187
Earth can be a scary place, but I know
everything about this old pale blue dot.

602
00:47:58.344 --> 00:48:00.053
Do you really mean that?

603
00:48:00.136 --> 00:48:03.719
I mean, not everything. But I watch
a lot of discovery channel and...

604
00:48:03.729 --> 00:48:06.604
I meant about me being your pal.

605
00:48:08.303 --> 00:48:09.719
Of course, buddy.

606
00:48:13.011 --> 00:48:14.613
Comin' in hot.

607
00:48:14.928 --> 00:48:17.636
Growing up, I didn't have any friends.

608
00:48:17.726 --> 00:48:20.643
Everyone in my village
thought my two tails were weird.

609
00:48:20.719 --> 00:48:22.469
Hey, I know that feeling.

610
00:48:22.471 --> 00:48:26.512
But then I saw you,
the fastest creature in the galaxy.

611
00:48:26.678 --> 00:48:30.769
You were weird too.
But you were a legend.

612
00:48:31.053 --> 00:48:34.699
That made me think,
maybe being weird isn't so bad.

613
00:48:34.701 --> 00:48:37.878
You inspired me to leave my village,

614
00:48:37.928 --> 00:48:40.601
to find you and help you in your mission.

615
00:48:41.469 --> 00:48:43.261
I'm really glad you're here, tails.

616
00:48:43.738 --> 00:48:45.581
I'm glad I'm here too, Sonic.

617
00:48:51.219 --> 00:48:54.355
Well, might as well get some sleep.

618
00:48:54.363 --> 00:48:56.580
This feels like a good place
to spend the night.

619
00:48:56.581 --> 00:48:58.580
You'll be able to get clear readings
on your gizmo thing

620
00:48:58.581 --> 00:49:00.855
once the storm is over, so I...

621
00:49:12.928 --> 00:49:14.495
Night, tails.

622
00:49:28.178 --> 00:49:31.475
Tails. Tails.
We have a situation.

623
00:49:38.081 --> 00:49:40.993
Today's forecast calls for
clear, sunny skies

624
00:49:40.994 --> 00:49:43.969
and a 100% chance of adventure.

625
00:49:43.978 --> 00:49:47.436
I pinpointed the coordinates.
It's right up ahead.

626
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:02.800
Hey, tails. Wait up.

627
00:50:07.914 --> 00:50:12.824
Okay, we got a giant owl door.
Seems encouraging.

628
00:50:25.553 --> 00:50:26.786
Check this out.

629
00:50:26.787 --> 00:50:29.772
- Can you translate that?
- Yeah.

630
00:50:31.084 --> 00:50:34.194
Ages ago, a fearsome group of warriors,

631
00:50:34.201 --> 00:50:35.768
known as the echidnas,

632
00:50:35.770 --> 00:50:38.123
forged the seven chaos emeralds

633
00:50:38.219 --> 00:50:42.139
into the most unstoppable weapon
ever created.

634
00:50:45.147 --> 00:50:46.886
The master emerald.

635
00:50:46.969 --> 00:50:49.638
With it, a single warrior

636
00:50:49.639 --> 00:50:52.256
could defeat entire armies.

637
00:50:54.469 --> 00:50:57.162
Believing no one should have such power,

638
00:50:57.912 --> 00:51:00.498
an order of heroes recovered the emerald

639
00:51:00.803 --> 00:51:03.506
and swore to protect it from evil.

640
00:51:04.743 --> 00:51:06.301
Sounds like the owls and the echidnas

641
00:51:06.303 --> 00:51:08.761
have been fighting each other
for centuries.

642
00:51:08.844 --> 00:51:10.912
Like vin diesel and the rock.

643
00:51:12.597 --> 00:51:13.897
Wait for me.

644
00:51:20.428 --> 00:51:24.678
Okay, giant owl door, giant owl.
Makes sense.

645
00:51:35.961 --> 00:51:38.944
Wait a second.
I've seen these symbols before.

646
00:51:42.959 --> 00:51:44.381
Here we go.

647
00:51:52.803 --> 00:51:54.389
Well, that did something.

648
00:52:11.901 --> 00:52:15.105
- The compass!
- This will lead us to the emerald!

649
00:52:20.635 --> 00:52:23.176
Hey, you got a little something on your...

650
00:52:23.178 --> 00:52:25.964
Oh, no. Tails, get back.

651
00:52:30.667 --> 00:52:31.706
Run!

652
00:52:39.019 --> 00:52:40.080
That guy again?

653
00:52:40.081 --> 00:52:43.594
Heads up, my little stalagmites.
Someone call an uber?

654
00:52:43.678 --> 00:52:47.316
Hey, thanks for doing all the hard stuff.

655
00:52:50.386 --> 00:52:52.511
But we'll take it from here.

656
00:52:52.964 --> 00:52:55.094
Okay, we really gotta talk
about your new look.

657
00:52:55.096 --> 00:52:57.983
It's like professor x
meets the monopoly man.

658
00:52:58.011 --> 00:53:01.753
And what kind of genius
shows up to Siberia in a convertible?

659
00:53:01.761 --> 00:53:04.761
The kind of genius
that can turn up the heat...

660
00:53:06.521 --> 00:53:08.425
With a flick of a switch.

661
00:53:20.015 --> 00:53:22.594
Good one!
I'm sure that wasn't important.

662
00:53:24.893 --> 00:53:27.242
Tails, that's our exit.
Come on.

663
00:53:41.206 --> 00:53:42.206
Let's split up.

664
00:53:42.261 --> 00:53:44.761
- You go high, I go low.
- Right.

665
00:53:44.844 --> 00:53:47.722
Quick little stretch and here we go.

666
00:53:59.178 --> 00:54:00.718
So you want to play?

667
00:54:05.795 --> 00:54:07.256
That's new.

668
00:54:18.328 --> 00:54:19.617
Sonic!

669
00:54:32.881 --> 00:54:34.366
Snowball fight!

670
00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:43.741
It's too easy.
Come on, challenge me!

671
00:54:57.719 --> 00:55:00.834
We are talking style and pizzazz.

672
00:55:08.053 --> 00:55:10.866
Yeah!
I make this look good.

673
00:55:13.136 --> 00:55:15.569
Oh, great. The winter soldier.

674
00:55:22.261 --> 00:55:25.592
For a guy named knuckles,
you are really bad at punching.

675
00:55:25.678 --> 00:55:28.469
Surrender the compass!
You are no match for me.

676
00:55:28.471 --> 00:55:31.010
I've been training for this
my entire life.

677
00:55:31.011 --> 00:55:34.636
And I had no training at all,
yet here I am ahead of you.

678
00:55:34.719 --> 00:55:36.912
That's gotta be embarrassing.

679
00:55:43.326 --> 00:55:44.748
My rings!

680
00:55:47.511 --> 00:55:51.147
Has anyone ever told you
you've got serious anger issues?

681
00:55:51.156 --> 00:55:53.615
You mock me with your weak jokes,

682
00:55:53.616 --> 00:55:55.886
but you know nothing about me, hedgehog.

683
00:55:55.888 --> 00:56:00.279
Well, I know you echidnas have a habit of
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

684
00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:03.476
Ruining your life?
Another bad joke.

685
00:56:03.478 --> 00:56:06.654
I lost everything because of you.

686
00:56:06.655 --> 00:56:09.761
My tribe was on the verge
of its greatest victory.

687
00:56:09.926 --> 00:56:12.801
The last of the owl warriors
had been located.

688
00:56:12.803 --> 00:56:16.553
Soon longclaw's emerald secrets
would be ours.

689
00:56:16.644 --> 00:56:20.217
But my father stopped me
from joining the fight.

690
00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.492
He said my moment
to honor our tribe would come,

691
00:56:23.553 --> 00:56:26.029
but it was not this moment.

692
00:56:26.030 --> 00:56:28.386
Those were the last words he spoke to me.

693
00:56:28.889 --> 00:56:31.030
I never saw him again.

694
00:56:32.467 --> 00:56:34.928
We both lost everything that day.

695
00:56:37.123 --> 00:56:39.060
- Goodbye, Sonic.
- No!

696
00:56:39.061 --> 00:56:40.763
Longclaw!

697
00:56:45.136 --> 00:56:47.011
Sonic! Are you okay?

698
00:56:47.013 --> 00:56:48.326
Deceiver!

699
00:56:49.233 --> 00:56:51.475
No, it wasn't a trick.

700
00:56:51.810 --> 00:56:54.636
Tails, take the compass
and get out of here!

701
00:56:57.594 --> 00:56:59.136
Yeah!

702
00:56:59.928 --> 00:57:02.185
Later, haters!

703
00:57:05.178 --> 00:57:06.303
Tails!

704
00:57:13.375 --> 00:57:14.959
Tails, come on. Wake up.

705
00:57:15.097 --> 00:57:17.805
He chose helping the fox
over pursuing the compass.

706
00:57:17.929 --> 00:57:22.281
Of course he did.
New friend, same pathetic weakness.

707
00:57:32.387 --> 00:57:35.718
Oh, no. No, no, no.
We're in real trouble here.

708
00:57:35.726 --> 00:57:37.513
Come on, tails.
I need you to fly us out of here.

709
00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.976
Time to wake up.

710
00:57:46.156 --> 00:57:49.275
See ya, kids.
Enjoy the fresh powder.

711
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:15.554
Did you...

712
00:58:21.195 --> 00:58:24.109
These rings signify the...

713
00:58:29.945 --> 00:58:31.054
Sorry.

714
00:58:31.484 --> 00:58:33.007
Thought it was on silent.

715
00:58:39.429 --> 00:58:40.851
These rings...

716
00:58:42.933 --> 00:58:44.523
So help me, Thomas!

717
00:58:49.273 --> 00:58:50.552
Okay, sorry, sorry.

718
00:58:50.554 --> 00:58:52.452
Excuse me, this is an emergency.

719
00:58:53.821 --> 00:58:54.984
Sorry.

720
00:59:00.663 --> 00:59:03.015
What? This better be important.
I just...

721
00:59:03.593 --> 00:59:04.593
Are you skiing?

722
00:59:04.595 --> 00:59:06.845
Snowboarding, actually.
But I need your help now.

723
00:59:06.847 --> 00:59:09.241
Life or death situation this very second.

724
00:59:09.242 --> 00:59:11.366
I need you to use the ring
I gave you to save me.

725
00:59:11.367 --> 00:59:12.570
Like right now.

726
00:59:12.572 --> 00:59:14.866
Okay, slow down.
I don't even know where you are.

727
00:59:14.867 --> 00:59:17.030
You just gotta picture
where you want the ring to go.

728
00:59:17.031 --> 00:59:18.429
So picture this.

729
00:59:21.015 --> 00:59:23.992
Oh, my god. Okay, okay.
Hang on.

730
00:59:32.210 --> 00:59:33.210
What?

731
00:59:34.556 --> 00:59:35.804
Did you throw it?

732
00:59:36.762 --> 00:59:38.959
- Oh, god.
- What? Tell me what "oh, god."

733
00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.983
I mixed up the rings
when I was teasing jojo.

734
00:59:40.984 --> 00:59:42.648
What? Where is it then?
Where is it then?

735
00:59:46.804 --> 00:59:47.804
You don't want to know.

736
00:59:47.991 --> 00:59:49.217
But I do, Tom.

737
00:59:49.218 --> 00:59:50.687
I very much want to know,

738
00:59:50.688 --> 00:59:53.262
before I become
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

739
00:59:53.345 --> 00:59:55.334
Hang tight, buddy.
I got this.

740
00:59:55.335 --> 00:59:57.304
With this ring, Rachel...

741
00:59:57.749 --> 00:59:59.179
Hey! Hi.

742
01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:01.749
Everything okay, bud?

743
01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:03.233
- Not really.
- What are you doing?

744
01:00:03.234 --> 01:00:07.062
This is gonna sound crazy, but I need to see
that ring for just one second, one second.

745
01:00:07.064 --> 01:00:09.747
- Have you lost your mind?
- I'm gonna give it right back, I promise.

746
01:00:09.748 --> 01:00:12.444
- Please, Randall, it's really important.
- No, bro. Go sit down.

747
01:00:12.445 --> 01:00:15.233
- Give me the ring, please?
- Randall, don't look at him, look at me.

748
01:00:15.234 --> 01:00:15.820
Randall, Randall.

749
01:00:15.821 --> 01:00:17.475
- One second.
- Put the ring on my finger.

750
01:00:17.476 --> 01:00:20.530
- No, Randall, listen to me.
- Randall! Look at me. Ring on my finger.

751
01:00:20.531 --> 01:00:23.262
- Give me the ring! Just one second.
- Put a ring on it!

752
01:00:24.012 --> 01:00:25.387
Please, love? Okay?

753
01:00:25.470 --> 01:00:26.210
With this ring...

754
01:00:26.211 --> 01:00:28.156
- Yes, baby.
- I'm so sorry about this.

755
01:00:38.392 --> 01:00:40.696
- Snow, my god.
- Oh, boy.

756
01:00:41.509 --> 01:00:44.212
Incoming!

757
01:00:54.387 --> 01:00:55.804
Anybody hurt?

758
01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.152
- Sonic!
- Hawaii.

759
01:00:58.153 --> 01:00:59.153
Are you okay?

760
01:00:59.270 --> 01:01:01.220
What's happening?
Are you hurt?

761
01:01:01.304 --> 01:01:03.620
- No, no, no, I'm fine.
- Okay, good.

762
01:01:03.621 --> 01:01:06.887
- Because you're in so much trouble!
- Okay, you calm down.

763
01:01:06.970 --> 01:01:08.304
You talk.

764
01:01:08.387 --> 01:01:09.804
Okay, quick version.

765
01:01:09.887 --> 01:01:13.293
Robotnik is back on earth
and he's after a magic emerald.

766
01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:17.075
We need to get it back
or the world is doomed.

767
01:01:17.470 --> 01:01:18.495
Tails!

768
01:01:18.496 --> 01:01:22.253
- Wait! All this happened since yesterday?
- Wait. Who's tails?

769
01:01:22.254 --> 01:01:23.371
Tails, can you hear me?

770
01:01:23.832 --> 01:01:25.425
Oh, lord, there are two of them now.

771
01:01:25.426 --> 01:01:28.202
Okay, okay, let me think, let me think.
Tails, come on, buddy.

772
01:01:32.413 --> 01:01:33.246
Hey!

773
01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:36.715
Randall, why do all of your friends
have weapons?

774
01:01:38.543 --> 01:01:42.121
You really should have taken me up
on that brunch, Mr. and Mrs. Wachowski.

775
01:01:42.304 --> 01:01:43.345
Olive garden guy?

776
01:01:43.347 --> 01:01:46.184
It's okay, everyone.
We're federal agents.

777
01:01:47.267 --> 01:01:49.395
You, too, agent. Go ahead.

778
01:01:55.720 --> 01:01:59.804
You mean to tell me
that this entire wedding was a setup?

779
01:01:59.887 --> 01:02:01.753
- Rachel, wait a minute.
- What?

780
01:02:01.754 --> 01:02:02.707
That's correct, ma'am.

781
01:02:02.708 --> 01:02:06.590
Every single aspect of operation catfish
was a complete fabrication.

782
01:02:07.387 --> 01:02:09.332
Operation catfish?

783
01:02:09.637 --> 01:02:11.676
So is everyone here an agent?

784
01:02:12.624 --> 01:02:14.184
Are you an agent?

785
01:02:14.749 --> 01:02:16.114
Son of a...

786
01:02:16.345 --> 01:02:19.679
Was the florist an agent?
How about the photographer?

787
01:02:20.304 --> 01:02:22.067
The woman who waxed my...

788
01:02:22.804 --> 01:02:24.098
At the spa?

789
01:02:25.684 --> 01:02:28.012
- Is jojo an agent?
- Rachel.

790
01:02:28.514 --> 01:02:30.639
- What?
- Rachel, listen to me.

791
01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:34.059
I'm done listening!
I am done listening!

792
01:02:34.262 --> 01:02:37.262
I am so sorry.
I am so sorry.

793
01:02:37.375 --> 01:02:39.239
I really am.
I am so sorry.

794
01:02:41.325 --> 01:02:42.996
No. Hey, no!

795
01:02:44.007 --> 01:02:46.504
Let him go! Hey!

796
01:02:49.054 --> 01:02:50.473
Sonic, hang on.

797
01:02:51.265 --> 01:02:53.731
- Take it easy. It's not worth it.
- Tom!

798
01:02:54.345 --> 01:02:57.058
Sonic is not a threat.
He's on our side.

799
01:02:57.059 --> 01:02:58.929
He's an uncontrolled extraterrestrial.

800
01:02:59.012 --> 01:03:01.504
And your days of aiding
and abetting him are over.

801
01:03:01.845 --> 01:03:04.254
Secure them in the hotel
until the chopper arrives.

802
01:03:04.637 --> 01:03:05.887
You're making a mistake.

803
01:03:05.970 --> 01:03:07.739
Hold on, major a-hole!

804
01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:10.144
This is still my day,

805
01:03:10.145 --> 01:03:13.667
and someone is gonna explain to me
what the hell is going on here!

806
01:03:13.668 --> 01:03:17.378
After the events in San Francisco,
a global task force was created,

807
01:03:17.379 --> 01:03:20.262
devoted to protecting our planet
from alien threats.

808
01:03:20.264 --> 01:03:23.043
That day,
guardian units of nations was born.

809
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:25.863
- G-u-n. Seriously?
- Gun, yeah.

810
01:03:25.864 --> 01:03:28.926
Look, what about protecting our planet
from Dr. Robotnik?

811
01:03:29.679 --> 01:03:31.054
Robotnik is dead.

812
01:03:31.056 --> 01:03:33.181
You're wrong.
He's back.

813
01:03:33.337 --> 01:03:35.895
And you just hauled away the only ones
who could stop him.

814
01:03:38.858 --> 01:03:40.699
Sounds like robotnik
might be back in play.

815
01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.371
If he is, I want him found immediately.

816
01:03:44.366 --> 01:03:46.770
And cancel my five o'clock
at the olive garden.

817
01:03:47.317 --> 01:03:48.802
- Aunt maddie?
- Yeah.

818
01:03:48.804 --> 01:03:50.559
Sonic and his friend dropped this.

819
01:03:57.406 --> 01:03:58.720
I have an idea.

820
01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:00.986
And I want to have a word with my fiance.

821
01:04:01.123 --> 01:04:03.007
And that word is "murder."

822
01:04:08.137 --> 01:04:10.179
Hey, come on.
You can't just leave us in here.

823
01:04:10.262 --> 01:04:13.874
My friend is hurt!
He needs a doctor, a vet, anyone!

824
01:04:14.845 --> 01:04:18.093
Tails, you got to wake up, buddy.
Please wake up.

825
01:04:26.242 --> 01:04:27.374
All clear.

826
01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:32.304
All right. Game plan.

827
01:04:32.387 --> 01:04:35.076
I get inside the hotel and find
where they're hiding Tom and Sonic.

828
01:04:35.077 --> 01:04:37.054
Okay.
Then I find Randall, right?

829
01:04:37.056 --> 01:04:38.725
And then I squeeze the breath

830
01:04:38.726 --> 01:04:43.218
from his lying, deceitful,
perfectly manscaped body!

831
01:04:45.176 --> 01:04:46.885
I'm going through a lot right now.

832
01:04:46.895 --> 01:04:50.273
- So let me process this my own way, okay?
- Sure, sure.

833
01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.233
- No judgment.
- Should've brought a journal.

834
01:04:52.234 --> 01:04:53.406
Okay...

835
01:04:53.859 --> 01:04:57.726
Okay. Is this meant to be a weapon?
This is adorable.

836
01:04:58.538 --> 01:05:00.015
Take that, Randall!

837
01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:01.748
Run, Randall!

838
01:05:01.886 --> 01:05:03.302
All right.

839
01:05:03.663 --> 01:05:05.514
- We're about to find out.
- All right!

840
01:05:05.515 --> 01:05:07.429
Let's go kick some Booty.

841
01:05:20.516 --> 01:05:22.343
Rachel! No. Rachel!

842
01:05:23.259 --> 01:05:24.523
In a minute.

843
01:05:30.335 --> 01:05:31.452
Stop right there!

844
01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:32.905
Get the bag.

845
01:05:41.522 --> 01:05:42.811
He's gonna come back down, right?

846
01:05:42.813 --> 01:05:44.166
I don't know.

847
01:05:44.429 --> 01:05:45.492
Good luck!

848
01:05:47.874 --> 01:05:50.413
Look. Tom and Sonic
have to be inside.

849
01:05:50.637 --> 01:05:52.429
I got a fiance to vaporize.

850
01:05:52.512 --> 01:05:54.218
- Watch your back, sis.
- Okay.

851
01:05:57.148 --> 01:05:58.148
Randall!

852
01:06:05.566 --> 01:06:08.101
We got her. Move in.

853
01:06:12.070 --> 01:06:13.327
Okay.

854
01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:30.601
I did not mean to do that!

855
01:06:43.345 --> 01:06:45.304
Something bothering you, agent?

856
01:06:45.749 --> 01:06:48.476
I just feel a little guilty
about what I did to Rachel, sir.

857
01:06:49.179 --> 01:06:51.429
Don't worry about it.
We'll send her a gift card.

858
01:06:51.512 --> 01:06:53.937
Now, I propose a toast.

859
01:06:56.923 --> 01:06:59.913
To a perfectly executed operation.

860
01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:06.121
Sir, we're under attack.

861
01:07:26.387 --> 01:07:30.202
Randall, wifey's home!

862
01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:36.577
Oh, my god. Rachel.

863
01:08:00.895 --> 01:08:03.728
What a woman.

864
01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:07.460
You no-good,

865
01:08:08.212 --> 01:08:11.514
lowdown, dirty, lying...

866
01:08:11.515 --> 01:08:12.688
Rachel, just listen to me.

867
01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:17.374
What kind of twisted sicko
tricks someone into a fake wedding?

868
01:08:19.387 --> 01:08:21.952
Party's over, bridezilla.
Stop right there.

869
01:08:23.178 --> 01:08:25.311
You son of a...

870
01:08:25.312 --> 01:08:26.906
- Have it your way.
- No!

871
01:08:27.437 --> 01:08:29.062
No!

872
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:36.444
Very disappointing, agent handel.

873
01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:42.637
- Is that supposed to be a weapon?
- I don't know, but we gonna find out.

874
01:08:42.727 --> 01:08:45.144
Haven't you caused enough trouble
for one day?

875
01:08:45.153 --> 01:08:47.679
I haven't even begun causing trouble.

876
01:08:48.179 --> 01:08:51.577
Hell hath no fury like a bride scorned.

877
01:08:58.137 --> 01:09:00.859
Looks like it's real, huh?

878
01:09:04.679 --> 01:09:06.054
No. Right.

879
01:09:07.962 --> 01:09:10.695
Be honest.
How bad is it?

880
01:09:11.027 --> 01:09:14.156
Not bad at all.
You got tased. You'll be fine.

881
01:09:18.298 --> 01:09:21.715
- I'm so cold.
- You landed on our ice sculpture.

882
01:09:22.047 --> 01:09:23.312
Get up.

883
01:09:29.058 --> 01:09:30.207
Just...

884
01:09:30.628 --> 01:09:33.874
Just tell me the truth, for once.

885
01:09:34.694 --> 01:09:39.375
Is there anything about you
or about us that was real?

886
01:09:39.638 --> 01:09:43.227
Rachel, look at me.

887
01:09:44.219 --> 01:09:48.494
Before I met you, I didn't think
that I was even capable of real happiness.

888
01:09:49.543 --> 01:09:52.179
But that all changed
when you walked into my life.

889
01:09:53.013 --> 01:09:56.125
And I ended up breaking the first rule
of undercover work.

890
01:09:56.471 --> 01:09:57.846
Which is?

891
01:09:58.596 --> 01:10:00.071
Never fall in love.

892
01:10:13.138 --> 01:10:15.805
- Maddie!
- We're busting out of here.

893
01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:17.085
How'd you get past the guards?

894
01:10:17.087 --> 01:10:19.226
Because that little fox
is into some crazy stuff.

895
01:10:19.227 --> 01:10:20.399
Come on.

896
01:10:21.783 --> 01:10:23.555
- Let's go.
- You're amazing.

897
01:10:34.096 --> 01:10:37.335
The owls were fools to think
they could hide this.

898
01:11:15.221 --> 01:11:16.388
What's happening?

899
01:11:17.926 --> 01:11:19.593
Wait for it.

900
01:11:31.221 --> 01:11:33.651
Yes. Eureka!

901
01:11:34.687 --> 01:11:36.502
I've found it!

902
01:11:55.841 --> 01:11:57.169
Sonic.

903
01:11:58.971 --> 01:12:01.013
- What is that?
- A big problem.

904
01:12:01.763 --> 01:12:03.680
The compass led robotnik to the emerald.

905
01:12:03.682 --> 01:12:05.935
That's got to be hundreds of miles away.

906
01:12:07.221 --> 01:12:10.638
All right. Huddle up.
Let's figure out a plan.

907
01:12:10.911 --> 01:12:12.926
- Together.
- There's no time for that.

908
01:12:12.927 --> 01:12:14.950
I'm the only one
that can get there fast enough.

909
01:12:14.951 --> 01:12:18.021
Sonic, this is way too big for you
to do by yourself.

910
01:12:18.408 --> 01:12:20.380
You see that little fox over there?

911
01:12:20.445 --> 01:12:23.445
He came all the way across the universe
to meet his hero.

912
01:12:23.513 --> 01:12:26.927
And what did his hero do?
I practically got him killed.

913
01:12:27.305 --> 01:12:29.365
You know what?
You were right.

914
01:12:29.805 --> 01:12:33.707
My moment came and I blew it.
I'm no hero.

915
01:12:33.708 --> 01:12:34.708
- Wait.
- No.

916
01:12:34.763 --> 01:12:37.096
I'm not letting anyone else get hurt
because of me.

917
01:12:37.188 --> 01:12:39.214
I'm gonna fix this while I still can.

918
01:12:40.636 --> 01:12:42.261
Sonic!

919
01:12:42.348 --> 01:12:44.115
Sonic, wait!

920
01:12:46.450 --> 01:12:48.341
Hold on. Hold on.
Wait, wait, wait.

921
01:12:48.471 --> 01:12:51.145
- Don't move. Don't move.
- Take it easy, little guy. You're hurt.

922
01:12:51.146 --> 01:12:54.896
But we have to help him.
You don't know what he's up against.

923
01:13:01.992 --> 01:13:03.367
You believe us now?

924
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:11.513
Hey, Bob!

925
01:13:11.515 --> 01:13:13.568
Hey, Maria, how you doing?

926
01:13:17.012 --> 01:13:18.035
Working on my moves.

927
01:13:18.036 --> 01:13:20.680
Just keepin' it green.
No need to burn the fuel.

928
01:13:20.682 --> 01:13:22.083
Speaking of fuel...

929
01:13:28.210 --> 01:13:29.585
Closed?

930
01:13:31.146 --> 01:13:32.510
That doesn't seem right.

931
01:13:45.474 --> 01:13:46.490
Close.

932
01:13:50.728 --> 01:13:52.020
Yes.

933
01:13:52.177 --> 01:13:54.802
Makeover, makeover.
Look at you.

934
01:13:54.825 --> 01:13:56.262
Freeze! Police!

935
01:13:57.560 --> 01:14:00.012
Oh, my god, you got robot hands.
You got robot hands.

936
01:14:00.013 --> 01:14:03.357
- No, they're gloves.
- Get 'em up. Now spread your fingers!

937
01:14:04.501 --> 01:14:07.513
Now wiggle 'em!
Wiggle your digits!

938
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:11.794
Yes! Like you just finished
a big musical number.

939
01:14:12.930 --> 01:14:14.169
Good.

940
01:14:14.555 --> 01:14:16.099
Why is there a light on your head?

941
01:14:19.904 --> 01:14:22.255
'Cause I'm the sheriff
for the weekend, pal.

942
01:14:31.055 --> 01:14:32.317
Water.

943
01:14:32.318 --> 01:14:34.396
Why did it have to be water?

944
01:14:37.356 --> 01:14:39.731
Okay, you can do this.

945
01:14:43.332 --> 01:14:44.915
Gotta go fast.

946
01:16:27.907 --> 01:16:31.243
I don't want to die like this!
It's derivative!

947
01:16:32.672 --> 01:16:34.571
Make room for daddy!

948
01:16:42.039 --> 01:16:43.101
Two and two.

949
01:16:43.194 --> 01:16:46.953
Great!
We're still bipedals, more or less.

950
01:16:50.243 --> 01:16:51.500
Fire in the hole!

951
01:16:53.583 --> 01:16:57.047
I've solved it. There is a booby trap
every seven seco...

952
01:17:03.513 --> 01:17:05.008
That was a little early.

953
01:17:06.419 --> 01:17:10.320
So glad it didn't cut off my mustache.

954
01:17:10.321 --> 01:17:12.844
Hey, little red wrecking ball.

955
01:17:13.305 --> 01:17:15.638
I know you're dying
to get your emerald on,

956
01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:19.618
but can we be a little bit more mindful
of our surroundings?

957
01:17:19.930 --> 01:17:21.188
May I?

958
01:17:27.626 --> 01:17:30.209
In 30 feet, turn left.

959
01:17:30.234 --> 01:17:32.571
Work smarter, not harder.

960
01:17:53.596 --> 01:17:55.354
My pelvis.

961
01:17:59.369 --> 01:18:03.869
Okay, secret temple,
let's see what you've got.

962
01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.563
No, no, no! No!

963
01:18:18.093 --> 01:18:19.493
No.

964
01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.180
Yes!

965
01:18:27.138 --> 01:18:29.055
You have arrived at your destination.

966
01:18:29.145 --> 01:18:32.145
Wow. That really
opened up the space.

967
01:18:32.228 --> 01:18:35.187
I can't even picture it
with an impenetrable wall now.

968
01:18:35.263 --> 01:18:37.380
And the rubble is always a nice touch.

969
01:18:46.451 --> 01:18:50.122
At last.
The master emerald.

970
01:18:50.221 --> 01:18:51.471
Ultimate power.

971
01:18:51.473 --> 01:18:54.306
Soon order will be restored.

972
01:18:54.431 --> 01:18:57.482
All because of what we have done together.

973
01:18:57.809 --> 01:19:00.443
Such a lovely sentiment, knuckles.

974
01:19:00.664 --> 01:19:03.451
I think I feel a single tear forming.

975
01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:07.279
Sadly...

976
01:19:08.318 --> 01:19:13.076
You're as useful to me now
as a backstage pass to limp bizkit.

977
01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:29.013
Nailed it.

978
01:19:30.534 --> 01:19:34.026
This guy is always trying to spoil
a bad thing!

979
01:19:35.013 --> 01:19:37.759
You guys are here, too?
Took the long way, huh?

980
01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.763
Is everything a joke to you?

981
01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:43.073
Why must you constantly interfere
with my destiny?

982
01:19:43.079 --> 01:19:46.842
Because my destiny is to protect
my friends and family.

983
01:19:46.974 --> 01:19:49.369
I think I just threw up in my mouth.

984
01:19:49.533 --> 01:19:55.198
And if you want that emerald,
you're gonna have to go through me.

985
01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:20.254
The echidna's taking no prisoners today!

986
01:20:20.494 --> 01:20:24.455
Sonic has heart,
but will he lose the quill to live?

987
01:20:25.869 --> 01:20:29.830
I don't want to fight you,
but you're not giving me much choice.

988
01:20:36.180 --> 01:20:39.235
Too easy.
Let's do this.

989
01:21:05.893 --> 01:21:10.627
Why don't you stand still
and die with honor?

990
01:21:10.635 --> 01:21:11.854
Let me think about it.

991
01:21:12.033 --> 01:21:15.768
Okay, I thought about it and I pass.

992
01:21:25.133 --> 01:21:26.711
Hi there, beautiful.

993
01:21:27.898 --> 01:21:30.110
You're the real deal, aren't you?

994
01:21:30.513 --> 01:21:34.149
Where have you been all my life?

995
01:21:37.969 --> 01:21:40.516
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

996
01:21:43.763 --> 01:21:46.638
Knuckles, stop.
Robotnik's stealing the emerald!

997
01:21:46.721 --> 01:21:49.327
What kind of fool do you take me for?

998
01:21:49.328 --> 01:21:50.513
Just look.

999
01:21:53.063 --> 01:21:54.396
Mine.

1000
01:21:55.638 --> 01:21:58.640
Wait!
That wasn't the deal.

1001
01:22:01.805 --> 01:22:04.431
You poor, naive creature.

1002
01:22:04.514 --> 01:22:05.931
It's not your fault.

1003
01:22:06.029 --> 01:22:09.654
A more advanced intellect would have seen
this move coming a mile away.

1004
01:22:09.722 --> 01:22:11.783
Or 1.6 kilometers.

1005
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:15.064
But I trusted you!
You were my friend!

1006
01:22:21.885 --> 01:22:24.878
I'm sorry.
That just hit me funny.

1007
01:22:25.250 --> 01:22:30.675
Let this be my final lesson to you,
you dim-witted celestial skin tag.

1008
01:22:31.306 --> 01:22:32.681
Friends...

1009
01:22:32.764 --> 01:22:36.764
Are open, honest
and vulnerable with each other.

1010
01:22:36.847 --> 01:22:39.604
Which means x squared
times the hypotenuse of y squared,

1011
01:22:39.605 --> 01:22:42.745
divided by the absolute value
of friendship, equals...

1012
01:22:42.806 --> 01:22:43.847
Dookie!

1013
01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.313
Oh, no.

1014
01:22:53.337 --> 01:22:58.728
Chaos is power!

1015
01:23:17.264 --> 01:23:18.889
Let's get out of here!

1016
01:23:30.931 --> 01:23:32.471
Knuckles!

1017
01:23:36.602 --> 01:23:39.759
Water again?
Come on!

1018
01:24:38.008 --> 01:24:42.501
- You saved me.
- Don't talk to me. I'm not in the mood.

1019
01:24:43.597 --> 01:24:48.314
How dare you attack me
in my hour of sorrow!

1020
01:24:48.542 --> 01:24:50.369
Why did you save me?

1021
01:24:51.751 --> 01:24:53.900
Because you saved me first,

1022
01:24:53.902 --> 01:24:57.569
which clearly gave you
a tactical advantage I do not understand.

1023
01:24:57.639 --> 01:25:01.697
It wasn't a tactic.
I couldn't just let you die.

1024
01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:07.056
Why? I've been trying to destroy you
since the moment we met.

1025
01:25:07.244 --> 01:25:11.056
Because being a hero
isn't about taking care of yourself.

1026
01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:14.556
It's about taking responsibility
for other people.

1027
01:25:16.847 --> 01:25:20.097
Wise words.
An ancient earth proverb?

1028
01:25:20.181 --> 01:25:22.597
No, sir,
that's a wachowski family special.

1029
01:25:22.681 --> 01:25:24.681
I got it from a guy in a rowboat.

1030
01:25:25.392 --> 01:25:27.204
Someone who means a lot to me.

1031
01:25:28.847 --> 01:25:30.556
Wait a second.
What's that sound?

1032
01:25:32.602 --> 01:25:36.734
Only Sonic the hedgehog
needs rescuing this much.

1033
01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.415
That sly little fox!

1034
01:25:41.798 --> 01:25:44.634
Come on, knucklehead.
We're not beat yet.

1035
01:25:44.847 --> 01:25:47.814
On the mountain,
you told me you'd lost everything.

1036
01:25:48.021 --> 01:25:49.521
The way I did.

1037
01:25:49.597 --> 01:25:52.347
But you seem so hopeful and free.

1038
01:25:53.347 --> 01:25:57.533
How did you move forward
despite failing again?

1039
01:25:57.681 --> 01:26:01.017
And again. And again.
And again. And again.

1040
01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.789
Okay, I didn't fail that much.
But I didn't do this all alone.

1041
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:07.547
I found a new family.
New friends.

1042
01:26:07.548 --> 01:26:08.954
And you can too.

1043
01:26:11.314 --> 01:26:13.845
You don't have to be alone anymore.

1044
01:26:18.472 --> 01:26:21.017
Are you kidding me with that handshake?

1045
01:26:23.318 --> 01:26:24.735
I'm done playing games, pal.

1046
01:26:26.409 --> 01:26:28.400
You're gonna tell me what I want to know.

1047
01:26:30.633 --> 01:26:34.275
And I am asking you for the last time...

1048
01:26:36.264 --> 01:26:38.722
What would you like on your bagel?

1049
01:26:38.978 --> 01:26:40.722
I'm not telling you anything.

1050
01:26:40.724 --> 01:26:43.640
And that is a display bagel.

1051
01:26:43.806 --> 01:26:47.014
I don't get it with you!
I mean, I've tried everything.

1052
01:26:47.097 --> 01:26:50.722
I was good cop. I was bad cop.
I was cop who offers you a bagel.

1053
01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:51.914
And nothing. It's like...

1054
01:26:51.915 --> 01:26:54.065
That is a display bagel.
Wow.

1055
01:27:03.462 --> 01:27:05.281
Doctor, you're here.

1056
01:27:07.139 --> 01:27:12.202
Yes, I'm here, and yet i'm...

1057
01:27:13.389 --> 01:27:15.272
Not all there.

1058
01:27:15.295 --> 01:27:16.662
Sir, are you feeling okay?

1059
01:27:16.664 --> 01:27:20.789
I'm more than okay.

1060
01:27:21.472 --> 01:27:24.597
I'm upgraded.

1061
01:27:24.681 --> 01:27:27.722
Sinister 3.0.

1062
01:27:27.806 --> 01:27:32.433
My game is next level.

1063
01:27:37.154 --> 01:27:38.202
Hi.

1064
01:27:40.974 --> 01:27:44.861
I can smell the electricity

1065
01:27:44.862 --> 01:27:47.435
in your brain.

1066
01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:51.608
You smell like a snack plate.

1067
01:27:52.639 --> 01:27:55.764
Yeah, that's fair.
I had a couple today.

1068
01:27:56.306 --> 01:27:57.928
Sit down.

1069
01:28:02.431 --> 01:28:04.092
In the chair.

1070
01:28:06.915 --> 01:28:08.412
I didn't know.

1071
01:28:09.306 --> 01:28:11.763
'Cause he, 'cause he
was in the chair, so I didn't.

1072
01:28:11.764 --> 01:28:12.405
Okay.

1073
01:28:12.472 --> 01:28:14.795
Sir? We have a problem.

1074
01:28:20.222 --> 01:28:23.234
- All teams in position!
- Set up a perimeter!

1075
01:28:23.347 --> 01:28:25.160
Move! Move! Move!

1076
01:28:40.274 --> 01:28:44.220
Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.

1077
01:28:45.014 --> 01:28:47.712
After all these years,

1078
01:28:48.139 --> 01:28:49.847
what I finally got...

1079
01:28:51.014 --> 01:28:53.220
Is a solution.

1080
01:29:03.681 --> 01:29:05.556
- Commander.
- Status report.

1081
01:29:05.639 --> 01:29:09.014
Robotnik is in there with stone
and a hostage. Possibly local pd.

1082
01:29:09.097 --> 01:29:12.472
I'm not saying he's dumb,
but if he is local pd,

1083
01:29:12.556 --> 01:29:14.220
this town's in a lot of trouble.

1084
01:29:14.972 --> 01:29:16.264
- Wade.
- Wade.

1085
01:29:30.670 --> 01:29:31.670
Okay.

1086
01:29:32.604 --> 01:29:35.146
Rockin' that new spring collection, I see.

1087
01:29:35.303 --> 01:29:39.717
Well, if it isn't the pastry king.

1088
01:29:39.847 --> 01:29:41.186
The donut lord.

1089
01:29:41.472 --> 01:29:43.732
A real genius would remember
the name of the guy

1090
01:29:43.733 --> 01:29:45.536
who helped kick your butt off this planet.

1091
01:29:45.537 --> 01:29:47.944
And I'll do it again if you mess
with green hills.

1092
01:29:48.389 --> 01:29:52.522
Congratulations on your oh-so-temporary
sense of superiority.

1093
01:29:52.547 --> 01:29:54.865
You're finished, robotnik!
We've taken everything.

1094
01:29:54.866 --> 01:29:57.849
Your lab, your drones, your funding!

1095
01:29:57.850 --> 01:30:01.678
Let's see how big of a man you are
without your silly little robots.

1096
01:30:02.431 --> 01:30:04.452
Would you like to see...

1097
01:30:05.798 --> 01:30:08.217
How big a man I can be?

1098
01:30:18.806 --> 01:30:21.972
Welcome to the new norm.

1099
01:30:32.264 --> 01:30:33.944
My god!

1100
01:30:37.569 --> 01:30:41.248
Doctor! Take me with you!

1101
01:31:05.634 --> 01:31:07.462
He's taking everything apart.

1102
01:31:08.333 --> 01:31:09.986
He's building something.

1103
01:31:17.540 --> 01:31:20.158
That can only be one thing.

1104
01:31:20.165 --> 01:31:22.439
The fearsome power of the emerald.

1105
01:31:22.522 --> 01:31:26.522
If that thing really turns thoughts
into power, we are in big trouble.

1106
01:31:26.597 --> 01:31:28.837
Robotnik has a lot of bad thoughts.

1107
01:31:28.839 --> 01:31:31.421
Hey, Sonic,
are you sure it was a good idea

1108
01:31:31.422 --> 01:31:33.264
bringing you-know-who aboard?

1109
01:31:33.363 --> 01:31:37.113
Knuckles isn't really a bad guy.
He's just a little mixed up.

1110
01:31:37.188 --> 01:31:38.896
I am not mixed up!

1111
01:31:39.314 --> 01:31:44.518
I have steely focus. And I'm complex.
And that's a lot for some people.

1112
01:31:44.688 --> 01:31:47.939
Hope you're not still mad
I hit you with that car.

1113
01:31:48.056 --> 01:31:49.806
I was completely uninjured.

1114
01:31:49.889 --> 01:31:53.431
And my revenge will come
when you least expect it, fox.

1115
01:32:24.514 --> 01:32:27.388
Sir, you're magnificent!

1116
01:32:27.389 --> 01:32:29.615
Thank you, sycophant.

1117
01:32:29.616 --> 01:32:32.024
Your admiration is inevitable.

1118
01:32:41.834 --> 01:32:43.264
I knew it!

1119
01:32:43.347 --> 01:32:46.116
Just like the stay puft marshmallow man.

1120
01:32:46.951 --> 01:32:48.662
World domination playlist.

1121
01:33:02.516 --> 01:33:03.682
Fall back.

1122
01:33:04.889 --> 01:33:07.893
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

1123
01:33:09.722 --> 01:33:11.806
How are we supposed to beat this thing?

1124
01:33:11.889 --> 01:33:12.931
We need a plan.

1125
01:33:13.014 --> 01:33:15.276
Knuckles, use your strength to...

1126
01:33:15.639 --> 01:33:17.972
Jump off the plane. Wow.

1127
01:33:18.056 --> 01:33:21.972
Okay, this is what we're gonna do.
Step 1: Light taunting.

1128
01:33:21.974 --> 01:33:23.826
Step 2: I have no idea.

1129
01:33:27.097 --> 01:33:28.264
Sonic!

1130
01:33:31.454 --> 01:33:33.264
Nice action figure, eggman.

1131
01:33:33.266 --> 01:33:36.470
Does it do anything
or just stand there looking ugly?

1132
01:33:39.813 --> 01:33:42.713
Like a blister, he keeps coming back!

1133
01:33:43.565 --> 01:33:46.805
He's on the okay-to-kill list.
Shoot the missiles. Make a decision.

1134
01:33:46.806 --> 01:33:49.728
I need a moment, sir.
I'm trying to figure out how to do this.

1135
01:33:49.735 --> 01:33:51.439
Did you even glance at a manual?

1136
01:33:51.735 --> 01:33:53.901
- No!
- I'll do it.

1137
01:33:54.013 --> 01:33:55.564
Pardon my lightning.

1138
01:33:55.571 --> 01:33:57.619
You might want to ground yourself.

1139
01:34:00.744 --> 01:34:03.400
I'm gonna pop that thing open
like a can of chili...

1140
01:34:05.639 --> 01:34:07.286
Hang on!

1141
01:34:20.484 --> 01:34:22.494
- Yeah!
- Close one.

1142
01:34:23.502 --> 01:34:24.986
Sonic!

1143
01:34:28.571 --> 01:34:30.057
Robotnik!

1144
01:34:31.823 --> 01:34:33.015
Deceiver!

1145
01:34:33.098 --> 01:34:35.143
Die, mosquito.

1146
01:34:47.522 --> 01:34:48.698
I felt that.

1147
01:35:07.473 --> 01:35:08.932
What just happened?

1148
01:35:08.941 --> 01:35:12.371
It's the stache masher.
Right here in the manual.

1149
01:35:14.487 --> 01:35:16.898
Return to sender.

1150
01:35:24.621 --> 01:35:25.955
Stone?

1151
01:35:27.307 --> 01:35:31.723
Great. Next thing you know, there'll be
a report about a hostile work environment.

1152
01:35:34.488 --> 01:35:37.778
Those were our best attacks,
and they did nothing!

1153
01:35:37.873 --> 01:35:40.504
We can't beat robotnik as
long as he's got that emerald.

1154
01:35:40.506 --> 01:35:41.723
He's too powerful.

1155
01:35:41.765 --> 01:35:44.753
Look, we aren't strong enough
to beat robotnik on our own.

1156
01:35:44.754 --> 01:35:46.182
But there's three of us.

1157
01:35:46.256 --> 01:35:49.423
Your strength, your smarts and my speed.

1158
01:35:49.515 --> 01:35:51.644
Together.
That's how we win.

1159
01:35:51.645 --> 01:35:55.957
So we make our stand here
on the field of battle.

1160
01:35:55.964 --> 01:35:57.196
As a team.

1161
01:35:57.614 --> 01:35:59.067
This is it.

1162
01:36:00.140 --> 01:36:03.082
This is our moment.

1163
01:36:04.848 --> 01:36:06.770
Time to fight.

1164
01:36:13.835 --> 01:36:17.543
Bad time to say this,
but I don't actually have a plan.

1165
01:36:18.314 --> 01:36:20.147
Tails, any ideas?

1166
01:36:20.223 --> 01:36:21.890
We have to find his weak spot.

1167
01:36:21.973 --> 01:36:23.598
I suggest the groin.

1168
01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.800
What? No. No!

1169
01:36:25.802 --> 01:36:28.519
Traditionally, yes,
the groin is the weakest spot.

1170
01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:30.683
Stop saying "groin."

1171
01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:32.239
Hedgehog!

1172
01:36:32.645 --> 01:36:33.809
Look out!

1173
01:36:36.707 --> 01:36:39.121
I know what his weak spot is.
It's me.

1174
01:36:39.223 --> 01:36:41.051
I'm the groin!

1175
01:36:43.801 --> 01:36:46.675
Think about it.
I live rent-free in this dude's head.

1176
01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:48.644
So if I go out there and rile him up...

1177
01:36:48.645 --> 01:36:51.033
He'll focus on only you,
leaving himself open

1178
01:36:51.034 --> 01:36:53.472
to a flanking maneuver
from me and the fox!

1179
01:36:53.473 --> 01:36:56.308
Hedgehog,
you are a brave and noble warrior.

1180
01:36:56.309 --> 01:36:59.000
Go to your certain death with honor.

1181
01:36:59.002 --> 01:37:01.699
We're gonna have to work
on your pep talks, pal.

1182
01:37:01.700 --> 01:37:03.661
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

1183
01:37:07.270 --> 01:37:08.717
All right, mustache.

1184
01:37:08.957 --> 01:37:11.557
You want me?
Come and get me.

1185
01:37:12.246 --> 01:37:14.515
You don't tell me
about coming and getting.

1186
01:37:14.598 --> 01:37:16.975
I am on the cutting edge
of coming and getting!

1187
01:37:16.976 --> 01:37:18.840
Coming, getting.

1188
01:37:18.842 --> 01:37:23.582
Coming, getting.
Coming, getting. Coming, getting.

1189
01:37:26.207 --> 01:37:27.996
You're really heavy.

1190
01:37:28.012 --> 01:37:31.012
That's because I am one
million percent muscle.

1191
01:37:31.019 --> 01:37:32.480
Faster, fox!

1192
01:37:34.023 --> 01:37:37.413
- Go! Move, guys! Move back!
- Let's go, that's it! Go, go, go!

1193
01:37:37.414 --> 01:37:38.475
- Keep going!
- Go! Go!

1194
01:37:38.476 --> 01:37:40.397
- No, no! Stop!
- Stop the truck!

1195
01:37:40.398 --> 01:37:42.140
Tom, what happened here?

1196
01:37:42.804 --> 01:37:45.194
- You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Let's get our kid.

1197
01:37:45.195 --> 01:37:46.875
- We need your truck!
- We need your truck!

1198
01:37:52.416 --> 01:37:54.937
Coming, getting.

1199
01:37:57.645 --> 01:37:59.750
So what's the plan here?

1200
01:38:00.280 --> 01:38:04.480
You gonna build a big robot house?
Get yourself a big robot wife?

1201
01:38:04.557 --> 01:38:09.132
I'm going to enslave humanity
and force them to service my machines.

1202
01:38:09.382 --> 01:38:11.814
First, green hills.
Then the universe.

1203
01:38:11.816 --> 01:38:13.117
Then the multiverse.

1204
01:38:13.223 --> 01:38:16.304
Then who knows?
Maybe that'll be enough.

1205
01:38:16.598 --> 01:38:18.172
Full disclosure?

1206
01:38:18.814 --> 01:38:21.593
You won't be there.

1207
01:38:26.429 --> 01:38:28.429
Eye lasers?
Really?

1208
01:38:40.578 --> 01:38:42.718
Snot rocket!

1209
01:38:44.057 --> 01:38:45.250
No, no, no!
No, no, no!

1210
01:38:53.598 --> 01:38:55.098
Giving up already?

1211
01:38:55.437 --> 01:38:59.414
Not so tough when you're fighting someone
700 times your size, are ya?

1212
01:39:01.056 --> 01:39:03.514
You can't beat me!

1213
01:39:03.804 --> 01:39:07.312
I'm all-powerful!
All-knowing!

1214
01:39:09.515 --> 01:39:11.890
All-seeing.

1215
01:39:12.648 --> 01:39:15.260
Looks like your fancy robot has a glitch.

1216
01:39:15.261 --> 01:39:17.054
Is it me? What about me?
I'm over here.

1217
01:39:17.055 --> 01:39:18.765
Up top! Down below!
Behind you!

1218
01:39:19.506 --> 01:39:21.592
I'm over here.
Sorry! Over here.

1219
01:39:22.114 --> 01:39:23.322
Too slow!

1220
01:39:23.348 --> 01:39:25.390
- You can't outsmart me.
- Missed me again.

1221
01:39:25.392 --> 01:39:27.482
I'm the outsmarter-er!

1222
01:39:31.679 --> 01:39:34.638
I didn't outsmart you.
I'm just the distraction.

1223
01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:35.932
Robotnik!

1224
01:39:36.479 --> 01:39:39.442
I am also a hologram.

1225
01:39:39.443 --> 01:39:41.348
Disloyal.

1226
01:39:41.432 --> 01:39:44.349
"Dis" is how I roll.

1227
01:40:12.812 --> 01:40:14.374
Where's my emerald?

1228
01:40:15.013 --> 01:40:17.303
No, no, no, no!
No, no, no!

1229
01:40:17.304 --> 01:40:19.585
Computer, auxiliary power.

1230
01:40:28.598 --> 01:40:31.203
The emerald.
It's right there.

1231
01:40:31.695 --> 01:40:33.788
Move, you hunk of junk!

1232
01:40:38.264 --> 01:40:41.324
I have to reach it.

1233
01:41:04.645 --> 01:41:06.075
Come on, come on, come on.

1234
01:41:07.944 --> 01:41:10.270
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

1235
01:41:19.098 --> 01:41:20.175
No!

1236
01:41:20.176 --> 01:41:21.434
We got you, Sonic.

1237
01:41:22.707 --> 01:41:23.981
Hold on!

1238
01:41:37.097 --> 01:41:39.520
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

1239
01:41:40.894 --> 01:41:41.894
Okay.

1240
01:41:47.348 --> 01:41:49.613
I got the emerald.
We could still defeat him.

1241
01:41:49.614 --> 01:41:52.903
Come on, come on.
How does this thing work? What do I do?

1242
01:41:54.059 --> 01:41:55.123
What?

1243
01:41:55.682 --> 01:41:58.778
No. No, no, no, no!
No, no, no, no!

1244
01:42:02.381 --> 01:42:06.801
Look at the happy little family.

1245
01:42:12.135 --> 01:42:14.856
You have to get away from me.
I'm the one he wants.

1246
01:42:14.857 --> 01:42:15.890
Hey.

1247
01:42:16.476 --> 01:42:18.237
We're not going anywhere.

1248
01:42:18.613 --> 01:42:19.877
We're family.

1249
01:42:23.465 --> 01:42:25.518
And families stick together...

1250
01:42:27.987 --> 01:42:29.440
No matter what.

1251
01:42:32.265 --> 01:42:33.721
I love you guys.

1252
01:42:34.307 --> 01:42:36.182
We love you too, Sonic.

1253
01:42:44.348 --> 01:42:46.364
No!

1254
01:42:47.989 --> 01:42:50.418
I got him!

1255
01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:54.184
I finally got him!

1256
01:42:59.140 --> 01:43:01.114
What was that?

1257
01:43:46.725 --> 01:43:49.031
It's over, eggman.

1258
01:43:50.348 --> 01:43:53.098
I like the new look.
It works for you.

1259
01:43:53.763 --> 01:43:56.763
What do you say
we just let bygones be bygones?

1260
01:43:56.765 --> 01:44:00.757
I did some things, you did some things.
There are good people on both sides.

1261
01:44:02.468 --> 01:44:06.023
Surely two intelligent beings

1262
01:44:07.057 --> 01:44:09.499
can work these things out!

1263
01:44:21.237 --> 01:44:23.515
- Come on, buddy. Come on.
- Get him, Sonic!

1264
01:44:23.598 --> 01:44:25.213
Yeah. Come on.

1265
01:44:42.139 --> 01:44:43.624
It's like that?

1266
01:44:44.644 --> 01:44:47.210
Okay, we're not friends.

1267
01:44:51.182 --> 01:44:53.960
Later, hater!

1268
01:45:04.848 --> 01:45:06.614
- Sonic!
- Buddy!

1269
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:08.932
Wait! You cannot touch him!

1270
01:45:09.270 --> 01:45:12.004
The hedgehog holds
the power of the emerald.

1271
01:45:12.398 --> 01:45:16.379
I am sorry.
He is no longer the Sonic you once knew.

1272
01:45:16.527 --> 01:45:17.527
What?

1273
01:45:37.538 --> 01:45:39.499
You got to try this.

1274
01:45:44.890 --> 01:45:48.223
Okay.
He is exactly the Sonic you once knew.

1275
01:45:50.098 --> 01:45:51.741
- Uh-huh.
- Uh-huh.

1276
01:46:00.027 --> 01:46:01.250
Sonic!

1277
01:46:03.483 --> 01:46:05.434
Bring it in, bud.

1278
01:46:06.723 --> 01:46:08.348
It's good to be back in blue.

1279
01:46:08.432 --> 01:46:11.765
The golden god thing was fun,
but blue has always been more my color.

1280
01:46:11.848 --> 01:46:12.932
Looks good on you.

1281
01:46:13.015 --> 01:46:18.730
Sonic, you were the most powerful hero
in the universe, and you let it go.

1282
01:46:18.731 --> 01:46:19.903
Why?

1283
01:46:21.386 --> 01:46:24.511
Because I still have
some growing up to do.

1284
01:46:26.723 --> 01:46:30.832
- And I kind of like being a kid.
- And you're not just any kid.

1285
01:46:31.138 --> 01:46:32.676
You're our kid.

1286
01:46:33.022 --> 01:46:34.286
That's right.

1287
01:46:34.515 --> 01:46:37.160
- Bring it in!
- Yay. Hugs.

1288
01:46:37.161 --> 01:46:40.200
It's a good thing we didn't do this before.
You would've blown up.

1289
01:46:47.885 --> 01:46:49.398
You fixed it.

1290
01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:52.814
I've spent my whole life
questing for this.

1291
01:46:52.890 --> 01:46:54.423
Now I have it.

1292
01:46:54.424 --> 01:46:56.058
Now we have it.

1293
01:46:56.141 --> 01:46:58.724
What do we do with it?
What next?

1294
01:46:58.808 --> 01:47:01.127
There were once two orders of heroes

1295
01:47:01.128 --> 01:47:05.455
who protected the galaxy from those
who would use the emerald for evil.

1296
01:47:05.456 --> 01:47:09.613
But they have all passed on
to the great battleground in the sky.

1297
01:47:09.615 --> 01:47:12.643
So we start a new order.
The three of us.

1298
01:47:12.724 --> 01:47:14.433
This is no light task.

1299
01:47:14.516 --> 01:47:19.542
We must make a vow to use our powers
to keep the universe safe,

1300
01:47:20.016 --> 01:47:21.849
to watch out for each other.

1301
01:47:22.143 --> 01:47:23.648
Our new tribe.

1302
01:47:24.035 --> 01:47:24.849
I know!

1303
01:47:24.933 --> 01:47:27.636
- A power bump!
- Good idea.

1304
01:47:28.399 --> 01:47:31.941
It's an earth custom.
An unbreakable promise.

1305
01:47:32.183 --> 01:47:33.474
Very well.

1306
01:47:34.266 --> 01:47:36.596
A power bump it is.

1307
01:47:37.856 --> 01:47:39.523
Power bump!

1308
01:47:43.433 --> 01:47:47.558
It's truly a beautiful day for baseball
here in green hills.

1309
01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:49.349
An exciting lineup today

1310
01:47:49.351 --> 01:47:52.948
with the debut appearance
of two new players!

1311
01:47:52.949 --> 01:47:56.981
On the mound,
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

1312
01:47:57.065 --> 01:47:59.846
miles "tails" prower,

1313
01:47:59.847 --> 01:48:04.847
facing off against the powerhouse,
knuckles the echidna.

1314
01:48:05.898 --> 01:48:07.773
I don't understand.

1315
01:48:07.856 --> 01:48:10.023
Why am I angry at the enemy ball?

1316
01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:11.347
You're not angry.

1317
01:48:11.356 --> 01:48:14.995
You just want to hit it as hard as you can
and then run around the bases.

1318
01:48:14.996 --> 01:48:19.667
But if my quest ends where I am standing,
why run at all?

1319
01:48:20.010 --> 01:48:22.557
I can't with this guy.
Why do I even try?

1320
01:48:22.558 --> 01:48:25.424
This is just a game.
We're out here having fun.

1321
01:48:25.425 --> 01:48:26.849
Just having some fun.

1322
01:48:27.128 --> 01:48:28.349
Fun.

1323
01:48:29.639 --> 01:48:32.182
All right!
Give him the heat, tails!

1324
01:48:32.183 --> 01:48:34.066
Hope you're ready for my fastball.

1325
01:48:34.073 --> 01:48:36.488
Your fastball will be dishonored.

1326
01:48:36.645 --> 01:48:38.635
And so will you, fox.

1327
01:48:38.636 --> 01:48:41.432
- Easy, guys!
- Don't think about it too much.

1328
01:48:41.433 --> 01:48:44.979
Just keep your elbow up,
eye on the ball and give it a ride.

1329
01:48:44.980 --> 01:48:46.707
A ride? To where?

1330
01:48:50.516 --> 01:48:52.113
Power bump!

1331
01:48:57.156 --> 01:48:58.614
Victory is mine!

1332
01:48:58.616 --> 01:49:01.096
Hey, no fair!
That shouldn't count.

1333
01:49:01.097 --> 01:49:03.558
First base is also mine!

1334
01:49:03.894 --> 01:49:08.224
- I think that was our only ball.
- I have conquered the second of the bases!

1335
01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:09.979
Who wants ice cream?

1336
01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:11.141
Knocked the cover off that.

1337
01:49:11.143 --> 01:49:13.238
- Ice cream!
- Ice cream, yeah!

1338
01:49:14.473 --> 01:49:17.931
I am having the fun!
What is ice cream?

1339
01:49:18.269 --> 01:49:21.266
It's a dessert.
If you like fun, you're gonna love it.

1340
01:49:21.675 --> 01:49:24.768
Yum. Dessert.
Does it have grapes in it?

1341
01:49:24.769 --> 01:49:26.698
No, not usually.

1342
01:49:26.699 --> 01:49:28.207
I'm proud of our little guy.

1343
01:49:28.849 --> 01:49:32.191
I really like his new friends,
especially the red one.

1344
01:49:32.391 --> 01:49:35.016
- He cracks me up.
- Heck of a swing too.

1345
01:49:35.106 --> 01:49:37.856
Come on, fox.
Our dessert adventure awaits.

1346
01:49:37.858 --> 01:49:39.316
- Good job, guys.
- Yeah.

1347
01:49:39.356 --> 01:49:42.832
You too, baby. Let's go get some ice cream.
Come on, come on.

1348
01:49:43.890 --> 01:49:46.056
I'm happy for you, pal.

1349
01:49:46.058 --> 01:49:49.224
Got your wingmen.
Perfect friends to grow up with.

1350
01:49:49.308 --> 01:49:52.691
- Come on, knuckles.
- My victory chariot!

1351
01:49:54.698 --> 01:49:57.535
I've got a lot more than that...
Dad.

1352
01:50:03.112 --> 01:50:04.445
Race you to the truck.

1353
01:50:06.099 --> 01:50:07.516
One, two, three, go!

1354
01:50:08.099 --> 01:50:10.224
No, don't go easy on me.
I want your best.

1355
01:50:10.316 --> 01:50:13.274
Sonic, I have just been told
they have sprinkles.

1356
01:50:13.349 --> 01:50:17.016
Ice cream and sprinkles?
This is your new destiny.

1357
01:50:17.550 --> 01:50:22.128
What a perfect meal to celebrate
my victory over you in base of ball.

1358
01:50:22.130 --> 01:50:25.199
- What?
- I mean, you barely beat me.

1359
01:50:25.399 --> 01:50:27.899
You've never been beaten so hard.

1360
01:50:32.370 --> 01:50:33.816
Can't forget this.

1361
01:52:32.931 --> 01:52:34.806
Agent, I want an update.

1362
01:52:35.012 --> 01:52:37.700
Still searching, sir.
We haven't found any sign of robotnik.

1363
01:52:37.802 --> 01:52:40.141
No one could've survived that crash.

1364
01:52:40.224 --> 01:52:43.201
He's toast.
Good riddance.

1365
01:52:43.391 --> 01:52:46.141
What a mess that lunatic made.

1366
01:52:46.895 --> 01:52:50.044
Sir, there's something else.

1367
01:52:50.148 --> 01:52:53.690
When we were wiping robotnik
off our database, we found something.

1368
01:52:53.766 --> 01:52:57.965
A file buried deep in our system
and dating back over 50 years.

1369
01:52:57.966 --> 01:53:00.524
- What was it?
- Coordinates, sir.

1370
01:53:00.641 --> 01:53:02.591
Coordinates? To what?

1371
01:53:03.224 --> 01:53:05.183
A secret research facility.

1372
01:53:05.831 --> 01:53:07.414
It was a black site, sir.

1373
01:53:08.141 --> 01:53:10.912
Someone worked very hard
to keep this hidden.

1374
01:53:11.974 --> 01:53:13.183
My god.

1375
01:53:14.141 --> 01:53:15.677
Project shadow.
