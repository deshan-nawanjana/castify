00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.650
WOMAN:
Good night, sweetheart.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.630
BOY:
Good night, Mom.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:39.780
MAN:
Sleep tight, kiddo.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.790
( light switch clicks )

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.590
( door closes )

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.590
( owl hooting )

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.600
( owl hooting )

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.160
( ticking )

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.370
( wind blowing gently )

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.260
( door creaking open )

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.710
( gasps softly )

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.200
( wind blowing )

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:21.510
( gasps )

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.070
( wind whistling )

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.140
( gurgling snarl )

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.130
( screaming )

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.610
( screaming louder )

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.600
Whoa!

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.630
( shrieking )

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.350
( screaming )

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.720
Oh! Aye! Oh! Oh!

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.840
( shrieking )

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.140
( alarm blaring )

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.410
( yelps )

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.390
COMPUTER VOICE:
Simulation terminated.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:12.840
Simulation terminated.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:17.250
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.050
Simulation terminated.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.220
All right,
Mr. Bile, is it?

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.870
Uh... my friends
call me Phlegm.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.040
Uh-huh.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.230
Mr. Bile, can you tell me
what you did wrong?

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.440
I fell down?

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:30.280
No, no, before that.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.040
Can anyone tell me
Mr. Bile's big mistake?

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.600
Anyone?

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.260
( coughs )

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.130
( groans )

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.670
Let's take a look
at the tape.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:40.760
Here we go.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.850
Uh, right...
puh-puh-puh-puh...

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.380
Ah! There, see?

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.330
The door.
You left it wide open.

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.210
( whimpers )

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.010
( all murmuring )

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.970
And leaving the door open
is the worst mistake

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.710
any employee can make
because...?

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:56.540
Um... it could let in a draft?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.060
It could let in

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:00.140
a child!

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.440
Oh! Mr. Waternoose!

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.130
There is nothing more toxic
or deadly than a human child.

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.470
A single touch could kill you!

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.520
Leave a door open

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.490
and a child could walk
right into this factory!

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.530
Right into the monster world!

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.950
I won't go
in a kid's room!

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.970
You can't make me!

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.960
You're going in there
because we need this.

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:23.290
( children screaming )

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.210
( whimpering )

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:26.410
( static and feedback )

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.410
( screaming stops )

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.570
Our city is counting on you

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.830
to collect those children's
screams.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.650
Without scream,
we have no power.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.780
Yes, it's dangerous work

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.750
and that's why I need
you to be at your best.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.810
I need scarers who are
confident, tenacious

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.690
tough, intimidating.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.130
I need scarers like... like...
James P. Sullivan.

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.310
( snoring )

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:56.180
Hey! Good morning,
Monstropolis.

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.560
It's now five after
the hour of 6:00 A.M.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:00.030
in the big monster city.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.790
Temperature's a
balmy 65 degrees--

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.750
which is good news
for you reptiles--

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.170
and it looks like it's
going to be a perfect day

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.250
to maybe, hey,
just lie in bed, sleep in

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.110
or simply... work out that flab
that's hanging over the bed!

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:13.680
Get up, Sulley!

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.470
--( screaming )
--( honking )

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:19.390
I don't believe I ordered
a wake-up call, Mikey.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.530
Hey! Less talk, more pain,
marshmallow boy!

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.090
--Feel the burn!
--( growling )

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.560
You call yourself
a monster?

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:25.580
( growling )

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:27.030
Scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet!

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.210
Oop! The kid's awake!

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.950
Okay, scary feet, scary feet,
scary feet, scary feet--

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.990
kid's asleep!

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.990
( roaring )

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.250
Twins! In a bunk bed!

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.600
( growling )

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.080
Ooh! I thought I had you there.

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.580
Okay, Sulley, here we go.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.920
You ready? Follow it.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.000
Oh! It's over here!

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.190
Oh, look over there!

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.650
Don't let the kid
touch you!

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:44.770
Don't let it touch you!

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.610
* I don't know,
but it's been said *

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.250
* I love scaring kids in bed! *

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.200
Come on, fight that plaque!
Fight that plaque!

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.690
Scary monsters
don't have plaque!

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:53.960
1 18... do you have 1 19?

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.590
Do I see 120?

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.910
Oh, I don't believe it!

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.370
I'm not even
breaking a sweat.

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.390
Not you!

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:00.640
Look! The new
commercial's on!

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:01.820
( yells )

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.970
ANNOUNCER:

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.250

We warm your home.

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:11.800
We light your city.

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:13.570
I'm Monsters, Incorporated.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.890
Hey, look! Betty!

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.250
ANNOUNCER:

to produce superior scream

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.360
refined into clean,
dependable energy.

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.730
Every time you turn something on

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.070
Monsters, Incorporated,
is there.

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:30.050
I'm Monsters, Incorporated!

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:31.790
ANNOUNCER:
We know the challenge--

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.720
the window of innocence
is shrinking.

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:36.140
Human kids are harder to scare.

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.800
Of course, M.I. is prepared
for the future

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:40.090
with the top scarers...

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.200
( child screaming )

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.780
the best refineries

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.670
and research
into new energy techniques.

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.860
Okay, here I come.

tomorrow... today!

WATERNOOSE:
We're M.I.--
Monsters, Incorporated.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.470
We scare because we care.

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:03.070
I can't believe it.

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.190
Oh, Mike...

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.700
I was on TV!

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.370
Did you see me?
I'm a natural!

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:09.400
( phone rings )

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.430
Hello.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:11.440
I know!

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.440
Hey, wasn't I great?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.690
Did the whole
family see it?

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:14.870
It's your mom.

00:07:14.950 --> 00:07:17.060
What can I say?
The camera loves me.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.880
( bicycle bell rings )

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.720
I'm telling you, big daddy

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:33.230
you're going to be seeing this
face on TV a lot more often.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.190
Yeah? Like, on
Monstropolis@s Most Wanted?

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:36.490
( mocking laughter )

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.980
You've been jealous
of my good looks

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:39.160
since the
fourth grade, pal.

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:40.620
Have a good day, sweetie.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:42.820
You, too, hon.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:44.840
Whoo!
Okay, Sulley, hop on in.

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:45.970
Nope. Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:46.980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.260
Where you going?
What are you doing?

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:50.150
Mikey, there's a scream
shortage. We're walking.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.280
--Walking?!
--Yep.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:52.250
No, no, no, my baby.

00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:53.250
Come on. Come on.

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.450
Look, she needs
to be driven.

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.960
Bye, baby.
I... I'II call you!

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.820
MIKE:
Hey, genius,
you want to know why

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:00.180
I bought the car? Huh?

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:01.190
Not really.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:02.290
To drive it!

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.650
You know, like,
on the street?

00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:05.020
With the honk-honk
and the vroom-vroom

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.040
and no walking involved.

00:08:06.170 --> 00:08:07.040
( mock whining )

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.550
Give it a rest,
will you, butterball?

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.210
Come on, you could
use the exercise.

00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:11.660
I could use
the exercise?!

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.730
Look at you.
You have your own climate!

00:08:13.850 --> 00:08:16.020

Morning, Mike!
Morning, Sulley!

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.710
Hey! Morning, kids.

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.720
Hey, kids.

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.720
How you doing?

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:22.420
Bye, Mike!
Bye, Sulley!

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:24.220

00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:30.990

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.640
Ah, nuts.

00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.660
( singing )

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:36.340
Hey, hey, hey! Fellas!

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.370
Hey, Tony!

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.750
Tony! Ba-da-bing!

00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.810
--Tony!
--Hey, Tony!

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.780
Pow, pow,
pow, pow, pow!

00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.320
I hear somebody's
close to breaking

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:44.340
the all-time
scare record.

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.600
Ah, just trying
to make sure

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:47.060
there's enough scream
to go around.

00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:48.150
( laughing )

00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.440
Hey! On the house!

00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:51.410
--Hey, thanks!
--Grazie!

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.220
MIKE:
Ba-da-bing!

00:08:53.330 --> 00:08:54.990
( startled gasp )

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.950
Oh, great.

00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.060
Hey, Ted!

00:08:58.130 --> 00:08:59.600
Good morning!

00:08:59.730 --> 00:09:01.080
( clucking )

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:04.260
See that, Mikey?

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.720
Ted's walking to work.

00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:06.990
Big deal.

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:08.770
Guy takes five steps
and he's there.

00:09:14.890 --> 00:09:16.390
( phones ringing )

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.120
FEMALE MONSTER:
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:20.370
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.
Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.420
Morning, Sulley.

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:22.420
Morning, Ricky.

00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.460
Hey, it's
the Sullster!

00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.620
See you on the scare floor,
buddy!

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:25.820
Hey, Marge.
Hey, how was jury duty?

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:27.430
Morning, Sulley!

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:28.810
Hey!

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.980
Hey, it's still
leaning to the left.

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.260
It is not!

00:09:33.310 --> 00:09:34.270
Hey, fellas.

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:35.270
Hey, Jerry.

00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.620
Hey, Mr. Sullivan!

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:39.430
Guys, I told you,
call me Sulley.

00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:40.510
( nervous giggling )

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.510
I don't think so.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.470
We just wanted to wish
you good luck today.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.580
Hey. Hey, hey,
hey, hey!

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.900
Come on, get lost,
you two.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.360
You're making him
lose his focus.

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:48.350
Oh. Sorry.

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.350
See you later,
fellas.

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.220
Go get 'em,
Mr. Sullivan!

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.340
Quiet! You'II make
him lose his focus.

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.420
Oh, no. Sorry!

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:56.390
Shut up!

00:09:56.430 --> 00:09:58.260
-( phones ringing )
-Monsters, Inc. Please hold.

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.450
Monsters, Inc.
I'II connect you.

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.790
Ms. Fearmonger is on vacation.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:03.020
Would you like her voice mail?

00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:05.800
Oh, Schmoopsie-poo.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:07.670
-( snakes squealing )
-Googley Bear!

00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.870
Happy birthday.

00:10:08.950 --> 00:10:11.480
Oh, Googley-woogley,
you remembered!

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:12.870
Hey, Sulley-wulley.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.200
Oh, hey, Celia...

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:15.340
weelia.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.050
( clears throat ):
Happy birthday.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.400
Thanks.

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.340
So, uh... are we going
anywhere special tonight?

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.860
I just got us
into a little place

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.950
called, um...
Harryhausen's.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:27.000
( gasps )

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:28.190
Harryhausen's?!

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.350
But it's impossible to
get a reservation there!

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:32.390
Not for Googley Bear.

00:10:32.510 --> 00:10:34.110
I will see you
at quitting time

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:35.420
and not a minute later.

00:10:35.510 --> 00:10:36.500
Okay, sweetheart.

00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:37.930
Think romantical
thoughts.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:40.060
* You and me *

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:41.490
* Me and you *

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.890
* Both of us together! *

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.310
You know, pal, she's the one.

00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:47.730
That's it.
She is the one!

00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:49.330
I'm happy for you.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.000
Oh, and, uh,
thanks for hooking me up

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:52.440
with those reservations.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.170
Oh, no problem.

00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.580
They're under the
name Googley Bear.

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:55.630
Oh, good ide...

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.780
You know,
that wasn't very funny.

00:10:57.900 --> 00:10:58.960
( gasps )

00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:01.270
What the...?

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:02.270
Wazowski!

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:03.240
( screams )

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.460
( grunts )

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.480
( chuckling )

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:06.730
What do you know?

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.600
It scares little kids
and little monsters.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.710
I wasn't scared.

00:11:10.790 --> 00:11:12.990
I have... allergies.

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.150
( coughing )

00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.760
Uh-huh. Sure.

00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:17.720
Hey, Randall, save it for
the scare floor, will you?

00:11:17.830 --> 00:11:19.330
I'm in the zone today,
Sullivan.

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.280
Going to be doing
some serious scaring.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.800
Putting up some big numbers.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:23.930
Wow, Randall.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:24.930
That's great.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.630
That should make it
even more humiliating

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.950
when we break the record first.

00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:28.490
Ha, ha!

00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:30.110
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:31.420
Do you hear that?

00:11:31.510 --> 00:11:34.390
It's the winds of change.

00:11:35.850 --> 00:11:38.540
( mocking voice ):
''You hear it?
You hear the winds of ch...?''

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.870
Oh, what a creep.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.100
One of these days,
I am really...

00:11:42.290 --> 00:11:44.780
going to let you
teach that guy a lesson.

00:11:46.990 --> 00:11:48.370
( deep croaking )

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.780
( liquid squishing )

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.940
Chalooby! Baby!

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.080
MIKE:
Good morning, Roz

00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.070
my succulent
little garden snail.

00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.660
And who would
we be scaring today?

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:05.010
Wazowski, you didn't file
your paperwork last night.

00:12:05.190 --> 00:12:06.690
Oh, that darn paperwork.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.250
Wouldn't it be easier
if it all just blew away?

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.480
( chair squeaking )

00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.900
Don't let it happen again.

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.500
Yes, well, I'II, uh...

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.910
I'II try to be less careless.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.340
I'm watching you, Wazowski.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.420
Always watching.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.470
Whoo! She's nuts.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.430
Always!

00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:28.580
CELIA ( over PA ):
All scare floors are now active.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.440
Assistants, please report
to your stations.

00:12:31.590 --> 00:12:32.870
( metallic clunk )

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.470
( machine beeps, bell dings )

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:51.500
( bell dings )

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:11.980
( clanking and whirring )

00:13:16.430 --> 00:13:17.680
( chime rings )

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:21.320
Okay, people, eastern seaboard
coming on-line.

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:23.360
We got scarers coming out!

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:29.900
( dramatic brass fanfare
playing )

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.210
Ooh, they're
so awesome.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.700
( knuckles cracking )

00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:03.580
( clanging and growling )

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:05.910
( snarls )

00:14:09.890 --> 00:14:10.920
( blowing )

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.150
( growling )

00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.430
Hey... may
the best monster win.

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:30.920
I plan to.

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:32.040
( bell ringing )

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:34.870
We are on in seven... six...

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.600
five... four... three...

00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:40.740
two...

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:43.380
( horn blaring )

00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:44.290
( growls )

00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:46.940
You're the boss.
You're the boss.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.090
You're the big,
hairy boss.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.290
( child screaming )

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:57.090
( bell dings )

00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.380
Oh, I'm feeling good today,
Mikey!

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.440
Yeah!

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.700
MIKE:
Whoa!

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:03.030
Attaboy.
Attaboy.

00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:04.360
Another door coming right up.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:07.010
( whirring and clanking )

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:08.370
( child screaming )

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.480
( bell dings )

00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:12.320
( growling )

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.640
You're still behind,
Randall.

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:15.740
You know, maybe I should realign
the scream intake valve.

00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:16.890
Just get me
another door!

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:17.920
A door! Yes, door!

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:20.400
( child screaming )

00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:22.200
( bell dings )

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.490
( bells dinging )

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:27.510
( beeping )

00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:28.410
( metallic clanking )

00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:29.410
( click and hiss )

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:31.940
( children screaming )

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:34.290
( bells dinging )

00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:36.720
( children screaming )

00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:45.730
Well, Jerry, what's
the damage so far?

00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:48.390
We may actually
make our quota today, sir.

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.380
Hmm. First time
in a month.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:53.580
( gurgling and burping )

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.140
Huh?!

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.490
( door buzzing )

00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:58.460
( screaming and sobbing )

00:15:58.540 --> 00:15:59.980
What happened?

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.170
The kid almost
touched me!

00:16:01.250 --> 00:16:02.560
She got this close
to me!

00:16:02.610 --> 00:16:03.860
She wasn't
scared of you?

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:05.040
She was only six!

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:06.430
I could've been dead!

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:08.410
I could've died!

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:10.600
Keep it together, man.

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:11.810
( whistling )

00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.430
Hey! We got a dead
door over here!

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:14.930
--We're coming!
--Coming!

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.630
--Look out!
--Out of the way!

00:16:16.690 --> 00:16:18.620
--Coming through!
--Excuse us.

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.160
( whimpering )

00:16:21.270 --> 00:16:23.800
We've lost 58 doors
this week, sir.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.820
Oh, kids these days.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:28.560
They just don't get
scared like they used to.

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.690
Let her rip!

00:16:30.780 --> 00:16:33.500
( buzzing )

00:16:35.650 --> 00:16:37.670
( metallic clank )

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.350
( eerie blubbering )

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.420
( child screaming )

00:16:41.490 --> 00:16:42.420
( bell dings )

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:43.420
Uh, sir?

00:16:43.490 --> 00:16:44.420
What?!

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.000
Look.

00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.210
CELIA ( over PA ):
Attention.

00:16:48.300 --> 00:16:50.310
We have a new scare leader:
Randall Boggs.

00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.490
( snickering )

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:54.130
( assistants cheering )

00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.150
( children screaming )

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:00.360
( knuckles cracking )

00:17:00.410 --> 00:17:01.340
Slumber party.

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.340
( laughing )

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.430
Whoo!

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.980
( beeping )

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:06.560
CELIA ( over PA ):
Never mind.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:08.380
Hey! Watch it!

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.760
( Sulley laughing )

00:17:10.950 --> 00:17:13.670
Well, James, that was
an impressive display!

00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:15.780
Oh, just doing my job,
Mr. Waternoose.

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:17.910
Of course, I did
learn from the best.

00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.280
( both laughing )

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.410
If I don't see a new door at
my station in five seconds

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:25.260
I will personally put you
through the shredder!

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:26.430
( screams )

00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:29.140
Hey, Wazowski, nice job!

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.680
Those numbers
are pretty sweet.

00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.090
Are they?

00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:33.550
You know,
I hadn't even noticed.

00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:35.120
And, uh...
how is Georgie doing?

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.330
He's doing great!

00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.730
I love working
with that big guy.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.740
( child screaming )

00:17:38.850 --> 00:17:39.970
Keep the doors coming,
Charlie.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.140
I'm on a roll today.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.920
George and I
are like brothers.

00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:43.980
( gasping )

00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.580
2319! We have a 2319!

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:48.680
( gasping )

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.340
( alarm blaring )

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.540
COMPUTER VOICE ( over PA ):
Red alert! Red alert!

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:56.080
Red alert! Red alert! Red alert!

00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.640
FEMALE ( over PA ):
George Sanderson

00:17:57.740 --> 00:17:59.430
please remain motionless.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.690
Prepare for decontamination.

00:18:00.770 --> 00:18:02.020
Get it off!

00:18:02.110 --> 00:18:03.610
JERRY:
Duck and cover, people!

00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:08.850
Oh, not the CDA.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.070
( siren wailing )

00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.990
CDA AGENT:
Move! Move! Move!

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.600
Coming through, please.
Stand aside.

00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:20.970
CDA AGENT 2:
Clear the contaminated area.

00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:21.990
( screams )

00:18:22.030 --> 00:18:23.760
CDA AGENT:
This is a 2319 in progress.

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:24.760
Keep the area clear.

00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:25.980
Coming through.
Watch yourself.

00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:27.190
( grunts )

00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.580
( whimpering )

00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:31.450
Stand back.

00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.370
Careful.

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.660
( metallic clang )

00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:35.990
( drills whirring )

00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:41.350
( all gasping )

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:43.500
( muff
ed explosion )

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.130
( drills whirring )

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:48.470
All clear.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.130
Situation is niner-niner-zero.

00:18:50.190 --> 00:18:51.730
Ready for decon.

00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:52.920
Hey, thanks, guys.

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:54.150
That was a close one.

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.610
Okay.

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.590
( shears buzzing )

00:18:57.770 --> 00:18:59.340
( screaming )

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.360
( whimpering )

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.330
( ripping )

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.620
( screaming )

00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:08.050
JERRY:
Okay, people, take a break!

00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:09.460
We got to shut down
for a half-hour

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.640
and reset the system.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:13.250
An entire scare floor
out of commission.

00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:15.310
What else can go wrong?

00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.060
Oh... what a day.

00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:20.950
We're just going through
a rough time, sir.

00:19:21.060 --> 00:19:23.140
Everyone knows you're going
to get us through it.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.120
Tell that to the
board of directors.

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.700
( slurping )

00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:28.400
James, this company

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:31.190
has been in my family
for three generations.

00:19:31.370 --> 00:19:34.350
I would do anything to
keep it from going under.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:35.790
Oh, so would I, sir.

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:37.250
Well...

00:19:37.350 --> 00:19:40.000
Say, I could use your help
with something.

00:19:40.150 --> 00:19:41.620
Anything, sir.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:43.700
You see, we've hired
some new scare recruits

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:45.710
and frankly, they're...
they're, um... uh...

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.360
Inexperienced?

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:48.930
Oh, they stink!

00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:50.270
Uh-huh.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:52.150
And I thought maybe
you might come by tomorrow

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.770
and give them a demonstration.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.870
Show them what it takes
to be a top scarer, huh?

00:19:57.030 --> 00:20:00.070
I'II start out with the old
Waternoose jump-and-growl.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:01.770
( growling loudly )

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.760
Ha! Oh, oh, yes!

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:05.220
Now, that's my boy!

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:06.650
( both laughing )

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:10.620
( ringing )

00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:13.720
JERRY:
Let's go, everybody!

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.200
All doors must be returned!

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:16.890
No exceptions!

00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:22.720
--Oh, yeah.
--Whoo!

00:20:22.790 --> 00:20:24.650
I've never seen anything
like you today.

00:20:24.730 --> 00:20:25.980
You were on
a roll, my man.

00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:27.090
Another day like this

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:28.410
and that scare record's
in the bag.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:29.400
That's right, baby!

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.400
Uh-huh.

00:20:34.510 --> 00:20:36.110
So get this--
as if dinner wasn't enough

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:38.230
I'm taking her to a monster
truck rally afterwards.

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:39.270
Nice.

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.630
What's on your agenda?

00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:42.280
I'm going to head home
and work out some more.

00:20:42.420 --> 00:20:44.340
Again? You know, there's
more to life than scaring.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:45.510
( sniff'
ng )

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:46.830
Whew. Hey, can I
borrow your odorant?

00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:48.400
Yeah. I got, uh...

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:51.270
smelly garbage or old dumpster.

00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:52.350
You got low tide?

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:53.360
No.

00:20:53.430 --> 00:20:54.360
How about wet dog?

00:20:54.430 --> 00:20:55.390
Yep. Stink it up.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:58.160
( growling )

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.510
You know, I am so romantic

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:01.270
sometimes I think
I should just marry myself.

00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:02.580
Give me a
break, Mike.

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.130
What a night of romance
I got ahead of me.

00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:06.460
Tonight is about me

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:08.300
and Celia.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.940
Ooh, the love boat
is about to set sail.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.010
( imitating ship horn )

00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:13.230
'Cause I got
to tell you, buddy

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.430
that face of hers,
it just makes my heart go...

00:21:15.550 --> 00:21:16.480
Yikes!

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:17.670
Hello, Wazowski.

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.470
Fun-filled evening
planned for tonight?

00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:22.510
Well, as a
matter of fact...

00:21:22.660 --> 00:21:25.320
Then I'm sure you
filed your paperwork

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.060
correctly... for once.

00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:31.850
Your stunned silence
is very reassuring.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:33.930
Oh, no. My scare reports--
I left them on my desk

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:35.960
and if I'm not at the restaurant
in five minutes

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.190
they're going to give
our table away!

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:38.200
What am I going to tell...

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.200
Schmoopsie-poo.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.780
Hey, Googley Bear.
Want to get going?

00:21:40.850 --> 00:21:42.000
Do I ever!
It's just that...

00:21:42.050 --> 00:21:43.170
What?

00:21:43.210 --> 00:21:44.210
Uh, you know,
there's a small....

00:21:44.280 --> 00:21:45.470
I don't understand.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.250
It's just that I forgot
about some paperwork

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:48.470
I was supposed to file.

00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:50.090
Mike was reminding me.

00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:51.220
Thanks, buddy.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:52.340
Whoo.

00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:53.800
I was? I mean, I was!
Yeah, I was.

00:21:53.930 --> 00:21:55.210
Oh, okay.
Let's go then.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:56.220
We're going!

00:21:56.300 --> 00:21:57.220
On my desk, Sulley.

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:58.510
The pink copies
go to Accounting

00:21:58.600 --> 00:21:59.880
the fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.120
and goldenrod ones
go to Roz.

00:22:01.230 --> 00:22:02.130
Huh!

00:22:02.230 --> 00:22:03.290
Leave the puce.

00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:09.050
SULLEY:
Pink copies go to Accounting,
the fuchsia ones go to Roz.

00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:11.290
No, fuchsia ones
go to Purchasing.

00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.200
The goldenrod ones go to Roz.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.940
Man, I have no idea
what puce is.

00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:21.170
Oh, that's puce.

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.750
Hmm?

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:27.650
Uh, hello?

00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:29.980
Anyone?

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.340
There's a door here.

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:33.390
Hmm.

00:22:45.910 --> 00:22:48.120
( door latch clicking )

00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:49.660
( door creaking )

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:53.050
( whispering ):
Hello?

00:22:53.090 --> 00:22:54.050
Hey.

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:55.050
Psst.

00:22:55.090 --> 00:22:56.790
Anybody scaring in here?

00:22:56.890 --> 00:22:58.780
Hello?

00:22:58.900 --> 00:22:59.860
Yo!

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:08.420
Hmm.

00:23:08.510 --> 00:23:09.470
( thump )

00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:12.580
( thump )

00:23:14.650 --> 00:23:15.610
( thump )

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:17.740
( speaking baby talk )

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:18.490
( screams )

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.440
Whoa! Ah! Ah!

00:23:21.890 --> 00:23:23.550
Oh!

00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:25.830
( giggling ):
Here.

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:27.110
Gotcha!

00:23:27.230 --> 00:23:28.990
( yells )

00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.190
( squeals in delight )

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:32.230
Eh!

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:34.310
( giggling )

00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.910
( yells )

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:37.840
( giggles )

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.440
( gasps, then whimpers )

00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:41.330
( squeals in delight )

00:23:41.410 --> 00:23:42.980
( giggling )

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:44.140
( laughs )

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:45.300
Oh!

00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.210
( loud crashing, toy squeaking )

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:49.630
Yeow!

00:23:50.890 --> 00:23:51.850
( gasps )

00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.760
( toy ducks quacking )

00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.860
( yelling )

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.860
( toy ducks quacking )

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.300
( quacking )

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:18.440
Eww.

00:24:18.550 --> 00:24:20.920
( toy ducks quacking )

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.300
( sighs )

00:24:24.390 --> 00:24:25.290
( yells )

00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:27.630
( panting )

00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.030
( toys quacking and squeaking )

00:24:33.170 --> 00:24:35.340
( squeaking )

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.040
Whew.

00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.500
( Sulley screams )

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:51.060
( little girl
speaking baby talk )

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.560
Kitty!

00:24:52.650 --> 00:24:53.770
( speaking baby talk )

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:54.780
No, no-- stay back.

00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:56.230
( speaking baby talk )

00:24:58.060 --> 00:24:59.210
( stutters in fear )

00:24:59.290 --> 00:25:00.250
( giggling )

00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.430
( speaking baby talk )

00:25:05.830 --> 00:25:07.370
( whine of disgust )

00:25:07.470 --> 00:25:11.280
( little girl
speaking baby talk faintly )

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.270
( whimpers )

00:25:13.370 --> 00:25:14.660
( door latch clicking )

00:25:18.150 --> 00:25:20.070
Hmm.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:31.850
( speaking baby talk )

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:33.020
( faint squeal
of delight )

00:25:35.230 --> 00:25:37.510
( sneezes )

00:25:49.310 --> 00:25:51.460
( murmur of conversation )

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.180
( knives being sharpened )

00:25:58.020 --> 00:25:59.300
PHOTOGRAPHER:
And hold it.

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.390
( shutter clicks )

00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.080
ALL:
Get a paper bag!

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:07.000
Mmm.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.500
( laughing )

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.070
Oh, Michael, I've had
a lot of birthday...

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:13.800
well, not a
lot of birthdays

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.960
but this is the
best birthday ever.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.000
Hmm.

00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.130
What are you
looking at?

00:26:19.210 --> 00:26:20.300
I was just thinking

00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:22.270
about the first time
I laid eye on you--

00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:23.440
how pretty you looked.

00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:24.570
Stop it!

00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:25.870
Your hair was
shorter then.

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:27.390
Mm-hmm. I'm thinking
about getting it cut.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.420
( faint squeal of fear )

00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.610
No, no, I like
it this length.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.620
( sighs of relief )

00:26:30.730 --> 00:26:32.170
I like everything
about you.

00:26:32.260 --> 00:26:33.320
Just the other day

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:34.640
someone asked me who I thought

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.590
the most beautiful monster was
in all of Monstropolis.

00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:37.660
You know what I said?

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.080
What did you say?

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.100
I said...

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.570
--Sulley?
--Sulley?

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:43.700
No! No, no.

00:26:43.810 --> 00:26:45.050
That's not
what I was going to say.

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:46.610
Mike, you're not making sense.

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.280
SULLEY:
Hi, guys!

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:49.790
What a coincidence,
running into you here!

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:51.390
Uh, I'm just going
to order something to go.

00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:52.350
Michael...

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.350
Sulley!

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:54.570
I wonder what's good here.

00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:56.090
Get out of here.
You're ruining everything.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.270
I went back to get
your paperwork

00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:58.280
and there was a door.

00:26:58.360 --> 00:26:59.320
What?

00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:02.330
( rattling )

00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:03.360
A door?!

00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:04.320
Randall was in it.

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.320
Wait a minute.
Randall?

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.360
That cheater!

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.190
He's trying
to boost his numbers!

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:09.550
There's something else.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.560
What?!

00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:11.820
Ook-lay in the ag-bay.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:12.830
What?!

00:27:12.900 --> 00:27:13.830
Look in the bag.

00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.600
What bag?

00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:17.790
( sighs )

00:27:18.980 --> 00:27:20.770
( gasps )

00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:22.510
( giggling )

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:23.800
Oh!

00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.070
They don't have
anything I like here.

00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.050
So take care, Celia!

00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:27.110
Excuse me, sir.

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:28.110
What's going on?

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:29.560
Celia, please try
to understand.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:32.490
I have to do something!

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:33.520
Michael?

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.130
PHOTOGRAPHER:
On three.

00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:36.380
One... two....

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.390
( squeals and giggles )

00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.350
( screaming )

00:27:39.470 --> 00:27:40.390
A kid!

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.620
Boo!

00:27:41.670 --> 00:27:43.330
( all screaming )

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:47.360
A kid!

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:51.240
There's a kid here--
a human kid!

00:27:51.350 --> 00:27:52.980
( exclaiming in baby talk )

00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:54.970
Oh!

00:27:55.050 --> 00:27:56.390
CELIA:
Googley Bear!

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.830
( yelling )

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.100
( blows raspberry )

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:04.280
Come on!

00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:08.540
( monsters screaming in terror )

00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:09.880
MIKE:
Let's get out of here!

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.170
CDA HELICOPTER PILOT:
Please remain calm.

00:28:12.370 --> 00:28:13.390
This is not a drill.

00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.300
( siren wailing,
tires screeching )

00:28:15.370 --> 00:28:17.320
CDA AGENT 1 :
We have an 835 in progress.

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:18.370
Please advise.

00:28:18.410 --> 00:28:20.620
Michael? Michael?

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.830
Oh, Celia.

00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.420
--Please come with me.
--Ow. Stop pushing.

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:25.370
Hey, get your hands off
my Schmoopsie-poo!

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.690
Building clear.
Ready for decontamination.

00:28:27.850 --> 00:28:30.730
Well, I don't think that date
could have gone any worse.

00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:31.910
( explosion )

00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.560
( electrical buzzing )

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:39.460
If witnesses are to be believed

00:28:39.570 --> 00:28:41.710
there has been
a child security breach

00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:44.040
for the first time
in monster history.

00:28:44.170 --> 00:28:45.550
We can neither confirm nor deny

00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.690
the presence of a human child
here tonight.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.410
Well, a kid flew right over me

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.780
and blasted a car
with its laser vision!

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.150
I tried to run from it,
but it picked me up

00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:56.710
with its mind powers
and shook me like a doll!

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.680
It's true!
I saw the whole thing!

00:28:58.750 --> 00:29:01.340
It is my
professional opinion

00:29:01.490 --> 00:29:04.270
that now is the time
to... panic!

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:05.710
Oh-oh.

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:07.810
( both yelling )

00:29:07.930 --> 00:29:09.110
Oh, it's coming!

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.450
It's coming!

00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.320
( giggling ):
Boo!

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.580
( both screaming )

00:29:13.630 --> 00:29:15.520
( distant sirens wailing )

00:29:16.670 --> 00:29:18.300
( delighted cry )

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:20.140
( yelling )

00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:21.620
No, no, no, no, no!

00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.800
Come here, kid.

00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.840
Whee.

00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.560
No, don't touch those,
you little...!

00:29:27.650 --> 00:29:28.580
Oh, now

00:29:28.650 --> 00:29:29.680
those were alphabetized.

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:30.840
It's okay, it's all right.

00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:32.230
As long as it doesn't
come near us

00:29:32.290 --> 00:29:33.250
we're going to be okay.

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:34.250
( sneezes )

00:29:34.290 --> 00:29:35.410
( screams )

00:29:36.290 --> 00:29:37.480
( yelling in pain )

00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.840
( whimpering in fear )

00:29:38.930 --> 00:29:40.080
Wanna ride on it!

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:42.460
Da, da-da.

00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:43.460
Da-da-da.

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.520
Oh, y-you like this?

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:45.530
Fetch!

00:29:45.570 --> 00:29:46.530
( giggles )

00:29:46.570 --> 00:29:48.140
( gasps )

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.580
Hey, hey, that's it!

00:29:49.670 --> 00:29:51.560
No one touches
little Mikey!

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.440
( whining )

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:55.440
Mike, give her the bear.

00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:58.210
Oh, no.

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.010
( piercing scream )

00:30:00.150 --> 00:30:01.500
( electrical buzzing )

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.230
( screaming and crying
continue )

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:09.340
( buzzing continues )

00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:12.590
( exclaiming in fear )

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:13.910
Make it stop, Sulley!

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.190
Make it stop!

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:16.480
Look!
See the bear?

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:17.590
Ooh, nice bear.

00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:18.600
( screams )

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:19.760
Sulley!

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.900
See?

00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.130
Ooh, bear, ooh.

00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.870
Oh, he's
a happy bear.

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:25.550
* He's not crying,
neither should you *

00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.020
* Or we'II be
in trouble *

00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.170
* 'Cause they're gonna find us *

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:30.300
* So please stop crying *

00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.440
* Right now. *

00:30:31.490 --> 00:30:32.610
Good, good, Sulley.
Keep it up.

00:30:32.690 --> 00:30:33.900
You're doing great.

00:30:34.090 --> 00:30:35.270
* Ooh, the happy bear,
he has no... *

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.510
( screaming )

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:37.870
She touched me!

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.950
Sulley, the bear!

00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:39.930
The bear!

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.020
Give her the...

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.540
Whoa!

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:46.510
( giggles )

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.980
( screaming with laughter )

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:49.860
( electrical buzzing
grows louder )

00:30:49.970 --> 00:30:51.000
( light bulb shatters )

00:30:51.110 --> 00:30:52.040
( giggles )

00:30:52.180 --> 00:30:53.710
What was that?

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.770
( thumping )

00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.770
I have no idea

00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.610
but it would be
really great

00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:59.250
if it didn't
do it again.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.470
( giggles )

00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:01.930
Shh, shh, shh.

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:03.140
Shh...

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:04.210
shh.

00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.020
Shh...

00:31:15.130 --> 00:31:16.320
Ah!

00:31:19.910 --> 00:31:21.060
How could I do this?

00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:22.550
How could I be so stupid?

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.180
This could destroy
the company.

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:25.210
The company?

00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:26.690
Who cares
about the company?!

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:27.710
What about us?

00:31:27.780 --> 00:31:29.220
That thing is
a killing machine!

00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.370
* La-la-la-la-la-la *

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.410
I bet it's just waiting
for us to fall asleep

00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:34.610
and then wham!

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:36.420
Oh, we're easy prey,
my friend-- easy prey.

00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:38.380
We're sitting targets.

00:31:38.490 --> 00:31:39.390
Okay, look, I think

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:40.770
I have a plan here.

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:44.000
Using mainly spoons, we dig
a tunnel under the city

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:46.060
and release it into the wild.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:48.210
Spoons.

00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:49.710
That's it, I'm out of ideas.

00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:51.240
We're closed.
Hot air balloon?

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.970
Too expensive.
Giant slingshot?

00:31:53.110 --> 00:31:54.000
Too conspicuous.

00:31:54.110 --> 00:31:55.130
Enormous wooden horse?
Too Greek!

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.410
( speaking baby talk )

00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:00.570
No plan. No plan.

00:32:00.650 --> 00:32:02.950
Can't think.
Can't think.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:04.050
Flatlining.

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.050
Uh, Mike?

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.300
I think she's getting tired.

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.250
Well, then
why don't you

00:32:09.390 --> 00:32:11.790
find someplace
for it to sleep?

00:32:11.890 --> 00:32:13.490
While I think of a plan!

00:32:15.130 --> 00:32:16.760
Are you sleepy?

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:18.820
You want to sleep?

00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:20.020
ls that what you want?

00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.420
Huh?

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:33.490
( crunching )

00:32:33.650 --> 00:32:34.960
Okay, all right.

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:36.560
I'm making a nice little area
for you to...

00:32:36.690 --> 00:32:37.780
( giggling )

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.420
No. Hey, hey,
that's my bed!

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.960
You're going to get
your germs all over it.

00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:44.150
( sighing ):
Fine.

00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.570
My chair is
more comfortable anyway.

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.040
( yells )

00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:49.060
What?

00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.290
( speaking fearfully )

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.030
it's just a closet.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.160
Will you go to sleep?

00:32:58.080 --> 00:32:59.770
Hey, that looks like Randall.

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:02.280
Randall's your monster.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.300
You think he's going
to come through the closet

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:06.380
and scare you.

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:08.410
Oh, boy, how do I explain this?

00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.520
Uh, it's empty.

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.970
--See?
--Ah!

00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:12.720
No monster in here.

00:33:16.330 --> 00:33:17.840
Well, now there is

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:20.460
but I'm not going to scare you.

00:33:20.670 --> 00:33:21.690
I'm off-duty.

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.050
Okay.

00:33:27.140 --> 00:33:31.400
How about I sit here,
until you fall asleep?

00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.800
Go ahead.

00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:36.290
Go to sleep.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.310
Now.

00:33:37.390 --> 00:33:40.240
Now... go.

00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:41.640
Uh, you...

00:33:41.690 --> 00:33:42.910
go...

00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.120
to...

00:33:44.190 --> 00:33:45.190
sleep.

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:46.800
( imitating snoring )

00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:48.270
( giggles )

00:33:51.740 --> 00:33:53.430
( sighs in relief )

00:34:10.420 --> 00:34:12.790
( door creaks softly )

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:20.270
Hey, Mike,
this might sound crazy

00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.260
but I don't think
that kid's dangerous.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.510
Really? Well, in that case,
let's keep it.

00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:26.650
I always wanted a pet
that could kill me!

00:34:26.770 --> 00:34:28.050
Now, look.

00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.840
What if we just put
her back in her door?

00:34:29.910 --> 00:34:31.380
What?

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:32.440
Mike, think about it.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.050
If we send her back,
it's like it never happened.

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.140
Everything goes back to normal.

00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:36.140
Is that a joke?

00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:37.270
Tell me you're joking.

00:34:38.950 --> 00:34:41.290
Sulley, I'd like to think
that, given the circumstances

00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:43.120
I have been extremely
forgiving up to now

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.470
but that is a horrible idea!

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:45.770
What are we going to do?

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.680
March right out into
public with that thing?

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.290
Then I guess we just waltz
right up to the factory, right?

00:34:51.070 --> 00:34:53.530
I can't believe we are waltzing
right up to the factory.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.680
Sulley, a mop, a couple of
lights and some chair fabric

00:34:56.840 --> 00:34:58.440
are not going
to fool anyone!

00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:00.750
Just think about
a few names, will you?

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.090
Loch Ness, Bigfoot,
the Abominable Snowman--

00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:05.680
they all got one thing
in common, pal-- banishment.

00:35:05.780 --> 00:35:07.160
We could be next!

00:35:07.220 --> 00:35:08.430
Don't panic--
we can do this.

00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:09.570
Hey, how you doing, Frank?

00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:10.680
Hey, guys.

00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.780
Everything's going

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.100
to be okay.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.150
( gasping )

00:35:14.190 --> 00:35:16.110
( equipment buzzing loudly )

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:19.690
Number One wants this place
dusted for prints.

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:21.040
Careful with that.

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:22.510
I got a good view from here.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:24.230
A little lower.

00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.830
This was recovered
at the scene.

00:35:27.070 --> 00:35:27.900
Don't panic.
Don't panic!

00:35:28.070 --> 00:35:29.000
Don't tell me
not to panic.

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:29.970
Just keep it together.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.000
Everything is not okay!

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:32.070
LITTLE GIRL:
Boo.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:33.580
...could be contaminated.

00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:34.800
Gentlemen, safety

00:35:34.850 --> 00:35:36.060
is our number one concern.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.400
If there's anything that...

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:38.510
not now, not now.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:40.090
Oh, hello, little one.

00:35:40.190 --> 00:35:41.880
Where did you come from?

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:42.980
Mr. Waternoose!

00:35:43.090 --> 00:35:44.720
Ah, James!
ls this one yours?

00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:48.410
Actually, that's my, uh,
cousin's sister's daughter, sir.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.360
Yeah, it's, uh...

00:35:50.430 --> 00:35:53.150
''Bring an Obscure
Relative to Work Day.''

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.770
Hmm, must have missed the memo.

00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:56.020
Well, listen, James

00:35:56.070 --> 00:35:58.500
why don't you stop by
the simulator after lunch today

00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.340
and give us
that scare demonstration

00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:01.590
we talked about, huh?

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:03.150
Oh, oh, sir, uh....

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.560
Excuse me,
Mr. Waternoose?

00:36:04.610 --> 00:36:05.860
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:08.220
All right then, I'II see
you this afternoon, James.

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.490
That is, if these gentlemen
haven't shut us down.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:11.680
Oh, boy.

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:12.680
Oh, a scare demo.

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:13.780
Well, that is great.

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:14.910
Why am I
the last to know?

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.130
We can bring your cousin's
sister's daughter along.

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:18.290
She'II be a big hit!

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:19.420
( equipment buzzing loudly )

00:36:19.530 --> 00:36:20.580
Halt!

00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:21.620
( yelling )

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:22.720
Stop him!

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:24.460
Hold him down.

00:36:28.210 --> 00:36:29.360
Come on,
the coast is clear.

00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.970
Okay, all we have to do
is get rid of that thing.

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.160
So, wait here while
I get its card key.

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.490
But she can't stay here.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:36.760
This is the men's room.

00:36:36.850 --> 00:36:39.470
That is the weirdest thing
you have ever said.

00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.900
It's fine. It's okay.

00:36:41.050 --> 00:36:42.140
Look, it loves it here!

00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:43.270
It's dancing with joy!

00:36:43.350 --> 00:36:44.600
Uh, uh, uh, uh.

00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:46.710
I'II be right back
with its door key.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.040
( laughs )

00:36:48.130 --> 00:36:50.620
That's a cute little
dance you've got.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.360
It almost looks
like you've got to...

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:54.070
( whining )

00:36:54.170 --> 00:36:56.050
Oh.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.080
( singing in baby talk )

00:37:03.910 --> 00:37:05.800
( singing stops )

00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:09.560
Uh, are you
done in there?

00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.000
( squeals )

00:37:11.050 --> 00:37:13.480
Ah! Sorry. Sorry.

00:37:13.590 --> 00:37:16.240
( singing )

00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:25.250
( toilet flushes )

00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:27.510
Okay, you
finished now, right?

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:28.890
Hello?

00:37:30.370 --> 00:37:31.300
( yells )

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:34.820
Boo.

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.220
( giggles )

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:38.520
( sighs )

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.180
( giggling )

00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:44.240
( chuckles )

00:37:44.350 --> 00:37:47.070
Where did she go?

00:37:47.290 --> 00:37:49.500
Oh, did she disappear?

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.060
Did she turn invisible?

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:53.860
( giggling softly )

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.440
I just have no idea.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:58.370
Gotcha!

00:37:58.470 --> 00:38:01.090
Boo.

00:38:01.210 --> 00:38:02.490
( giggles )

00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.300
Hey, you're good.

00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:07.250
( sighs )

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.510
Be relaxed,
be relaxed, be relaxed.

00:38:13.650 --> 00:38:15.190
Roz, my tender,
oozing blossom

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:16.790
you're looking
fabulous today.

00:38:16.860 --> 00:38:18.070
Is that a new haircut?

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:19.210
Come on, tell me.

00:38:19.290 --> 00:38:20.540
It's a new haircut,
isn't it?

00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:21.650
That's got to be
a new haircut.

00:38:21.730 --> 00:38:22.690
New makeup?
You've had a lift.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.110
You've had a tuck.
You've had something.

00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.020
Something has been
inserted in your skin

00:38:26.130 --> 00:38:27.320
that makes you look like...

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.030
( sighs )

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:30.350
Listen, I need a favor.

00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:32.360
Randall was working
late last night

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.750
out on the scare floor.

00:38:33.810 --> 00:38:36.500
I really need the key
for the door he was using.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.240
Well, isn't that nice?

00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.590
But guess what?

00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.980
You didn't turn in
your paperwork last night.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.010
He didn't... I...
no paperwork?

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.070
This office is now closed.

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.790
( Mike screams in pain )

00:38:51.460 --> 00:38:53.280
Ready or not, here I come!

00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.220
I'm getting warmer.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:56.480
Any second now.

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:59.640
Fee fi fo...

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.890
What are you doing?!

00:39:00.970 --> 00:39:02.700
I-I'm looking
for the kid.

00:39:02.810 --> 00:39:03.890
You lost it?!

00:39:03.970 --> 00:39:05.220
No, no, she was just....

00:39:05.340 --> 00:39:07.010
( squeals )

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:08.300
Here she is.

00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.340
( whining )

00:39:09.450 --> 00:39:10.730
Hey, what's the matter?

00:39:10.810 --> 00:39:13.500
RANDALL:
I already told your buddies
I haven't seen anything.

00:39:13.650 --> 00:39:15.060
CDA AGENT:
All right, carry on.

00:39:23.330 --> 00:39:24.420
( splashing )

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:26.540
Randall!
Thank goodness!

00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:28.970
What are we going to do
about the child?

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:30.220
Shh!

00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.420
Shh, shh, shh.

00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.400
( door slams open )

00:39:44.450 --> 00:39:45.470
( door slams open )

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.440
The front page!
It's on the front page.

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.350
The child--
the one you were after.

00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:55.520
Will you be quiet?!

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.680
Don't you think I'm aware
of the situation?

00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.520
I was up all night
trying to find it.

00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.080
I did a simple
calculation

00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.570
factoring in the size
of the sushi restaurant.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.180
The child
may have escaped!

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:06.840
Yeah, well, until
we know for sure

00:40:06.910 --> 00:40:09.080
we're going to act like nothing
happened, understand?

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.910
You just get the machine
up and running.

00:40:10.980 --> 00:40:12.130
I'II take care of the kid.

00:40:12.210 --> 00:40:14.360
And when I find whoever
let it out, they're dead!

00:40:14.450 --> 00:40:15.830
Oh!

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.730
Why are you still here?

00:40:18.790 --> 00:40:19.940
Come on, go!

00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:21.170
Move! Now!

00:40:21.260 --> 00:40:22.630
FUNGUS:
Ow, ow! I'm not here.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.770
SULLEY ( whispering ):
They're gone.

00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:26.400
( squeaking and splashing )

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.220
LITTLE GIRL:
Eww.

00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.500
MIKE:
This is bad.

00:40:29.530 --> 00:40:31.000
This is so very bad.

00:40:31.070 --> 00:40:32.640
What were they talking
about a machine?

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:33.730
Who cares? Oh!

00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:35.310
Look, don't panic--
all we have to do

00:40:35.410 --> 00:40:37.040
is call her door down
and send her home.

00:40:37.110 --> 00:40:38.450
You're right,
you're right.

00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.720
We're just two regular joes
on our way to work.

00:40:40.810 --> 00:40:42.120
We will blend right in.

00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:43.590
Top of the mornin', fellas!

00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:45.090
Hey, what's
shakin', bacon?

00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:46.240
Did you lose weight?

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.340
Or a limb?

00:40:47.390 --> 00:40:48.630
You have
her card key, right?

00:40:48.690 --> 00:40:49.970
Of course
I have her card key.

00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:51.430
I told you
I'd get her card key.

00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.640
I went and got
her card key

00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:54.710
and now I have her card key.

00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.010
Okay, here we go.

00:40:58.100 --> 00:40:59.220
Take care of yourself.

00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:01.350
Try not to run
through any more closets.

00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:02.650
( giggles )

00:41:02.770 --> 00:41:05.200
Mike, that's
not her door.

00:41:05.310 --> 00:41:06.870
What are you
talking about?

00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:08.540
Of course it's her door.
It's her door.

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:10.660
No, her door was white
and it had flowers on it.

00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.540
No. It must have been
dark last night

00:41:12.610 --> 00:41:13.860
because this is its door.

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:15.070
( polka music playing )

00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:16.140
Hey, you hear that?

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:18.140
Sounds like
fun in there!

00:41:18.250 --> 00:41:19.630
Okay, send me a postcard, kid.

00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:21.160
That's Mike Wazowski, care of

00:41:21.250 --> 00:41:23.460
22 Mike-Wazowski-
you-got-your-life-back lane.

00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.160
Mowki Kowski.

00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.920
Very good.
Now bon voyage!

00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:28.440
Bye-bye!
Come on.

00:41:28.530 --> 00:41:30.130
Look at the stick.
See the stick?

00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.410
Go get the stick!
Go fetch.

00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:33.420
Mike, this isn't
Boo's door.

00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:34.820
Boo? What's Boo?

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.270
That's what I decided
to call her.

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:38.810
Is there a problem?

00:41:38.940 --> 00:41:40.640
Sulley, you're not
supposed to name it.

00:41:40.710 --> 00:41:43.010
Once you name it, you start
getting attached to it!

00:41:43.150 --> 00:41:44.140
Now put that thing

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.060
back where it came from,
or so help me...

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:51.910
Oh, hey!

00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:54.580
We're rehearsing a scene
for the upcoming company play

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:56.990
called Put That Thing
Back Where lt Came From

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.410
Or So Help Me%

00:41:58.530 --> 00:41:59.490
( Mike laughing )

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:00.590
It's a musical!

00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:02.650
* Put that thing back where
it came from or so help me *

00:42:02.830 --> 00:42:03.890
* Bom-bom, bom-bom,
bom-bom... *

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:04.930
* So help me,
so help me. *

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.290
And cut!

00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.430
We're still
working on it.

00:42:07.500 --> 00:42:08.460
It's a work
in progress

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.110
but, hey,
we need ushers.

00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.270
Sulley, I've had enough.

00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:13.070
Now say good-bye to...
where'd it go?

00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:14.140
What'd you do with it?

00:42:14.210 --> 00:42:15.170
( gasps ):
Where is she?

00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:16.270
I don't believe it.

00:42:16.380 --> 00:42:17.630
She got away
from you again?!

00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:18.770
Well, that is just...

00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:19.910
Wait a minute.

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:21.460
The sun is coming up.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:22.770
This is perfect!

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.680
She's gone!

00:42:24.790 --> 00:42:26.100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.120
Where are you going?

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.440
Sulley, please,
don't blow this.

00:42:28.560 --> 00:42:30.420
Not when we're so close
to breaking the record.

00:42:30.560 --> 00:42:31.810
Somebody else
will find the kid.

00:42:31.870 --> 00:42:33.210
It'II be their problem,
not ours!

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.160
She's out of our hair!

00:42:35.270 --> 00:42:36.680
What are you
two doing?

00:42:36.740 --> 00:42:38.820
They're rehearsing a play.

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.510
* She's out of our hair! *

00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:41.660
Can it, Wazowski!

00:42:41.710 --> 00:42:44.650
So, what do you think of that
kid getting out, Sullivan?

00:42:44.810 --> 00:42:45.960
Pretty crazy, huh?

00:42:46.110 --> 00:42:47.870
Oh, yeah, crazy.

00:42:47.950 --> 00:42:49.070
Word on the street is the kid's

00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:50.240
been traced back
to this factory.

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:51.530
You haven't seen anything,
have you?

00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:53.090
Uh, well, uh...

00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:54.310
No, no way!

00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:56.630
But if it was
an inside job

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:58.580
I'd put my money
on Waxford.

00:42:58.690 --> 00:42:59.810
Waxford?

00:42:59.890 --> 00:43:01.140
Yeah, the one
at station six.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:02.730
You know, he's got
them shifty eyes.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:03.990
Hey, Waxford!

00:43:04.170 --> 00:43:05.250
Sulley!

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:06.840
CELIA:
Michael Wazowski!

00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:09.790
( whimpers )

00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:12.020
last night was one
of the worst nights

00:43:12.110 --> 00:43:13.680
of my entire life,
bar none!

00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.220
( hissing )

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.430
I thought
you cared about me.

00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:18.510
Honey, please.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.850
Schmoopsie, I thought
you liked sushi.

00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:22.450
CELIA:
Sushi? Sushi?!!

00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:25.080
You think this is
about sushi?!

00:43:30.830 --> 00:43:31.980
Wazowski!

00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.630
Michael! Mike...

00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:35.050
Men.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:36.200
( panting )

00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:37.610
Breathe. Keep breathing.

00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:47.850
Whew.

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:49.030
Yikes!

00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:50.870
Where's the kid?

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:52.620
Kid? What kid?

00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.160
lt's here in
the factory, isn't it?

00:43:54.290 --> 00:43:55.470
You're not
pinning this on me.

00:43:55.560 --> 00:43:56.770
It never would
have gotten out

00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:58.520
if you hadn't been
cheating last night!

00:43:58.590 --> 00:43:59.620
Cheating?

00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:02.660
Cheating. Right.

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:06.540
Okay, I think I know how
to make this all go away.

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:10.640
What happens when the whistle
blows in five minutes?

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.300
Uh... I get a time-out?

00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:16.100
Everyone goes to lunch!

00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.450
Which means the scare floor
will be...?

00:44:20.850 --> 00:44:22.000
Painted?

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.000
Empty! It'II be
empty, you idiot!

00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:26.850
You see that clock?

00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:29.130
When the big hand
is pointing up

00:44:29.330 --> 00:44:31.410
and the little hand
is pointing up

00:44:31.530 --> 00:44:33.900
the kid's door
will be in my station.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.270
But when the big hand
points down

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:38.890
the door will be gone.

00:44:39.070 --> 00:44:42.040
You have until then
to put the kid back.

00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.830
Get the picture?

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.440
( roaring playfully )

00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:55.910
Boo!

00:44:55.990 --> 00:44:57.490
( giggles )

00:44:57.590 --> 00:44:58.520
No.

00:44:58.590 --> 00:44:59.680
Hey, you! Halt!

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.330
He's the one.

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:02.770
The one from
the commercial!

00:45:02.890 --> 00:45:03.950
Affirmative.
That's him.

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.280
Can we get
an autograph?

00:45:05.330 --> 00:45:06.870
Oh, oh, sure.
No problem.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:10.070
You can make that out
to Bethany, my daughter.

00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:11.420
Yes. Let's see...

00:45:11.470 --> 00:45:13.290
''From your scary friend

00:45:13.410 --> 00:45:15.010
best wishes...''

00:45:15.070 --> 00:45:17.030
So I said,
''If you talk to me

00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.350
like that again,
we're through!''

00:45:19.480 --> 00:45:20.470
What'd she say?

00:45:20.610 --> 00:45:21.700
You know my mom.

00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.440
She sent me to my room.

00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:25.280
See you guys later,
take it easy.

00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:26.470
Bottoms up!

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:30.490
( gasps in horror )

00:45:43.470 --> 00:45:44.590
No!

00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:48.160
( singing )

00:45:48.380 --> 00:45:49.270
Whoa!

00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:50.530
Hey.

00:45:50.580 --> 00:45:52.660
( growling )

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.350
Oh, well, hello, there.

00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.570
What's your name?

00:45:55.650 --> 00:45:57.440
Mike Wazowski!

00:45:58.790 --> 00:46:01.380
( machinery pounding loudly )

00:46:09.770 --> 00:46:11.690
( grinding and chopping )

00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.150
( panting )

00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:34.770
( moans )

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:37.990
Sulley!

00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:39.760
Oh, Sulley.

00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.240
Okay, Sulley, come on, enough.

00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:45.350
Hey, you guys seen
Sulley anywhere?

00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:46.620
Nope. Sorry.

00:46:46.770 --> 00:46:47.890
Oh, Sulley!

00:46:48.010 --> 00:46:50.440
Boy, Wazowski looks
like he's in trouble.

00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:51.990
( squeaking and quacking )

00:46:52.110 --> 00:46:53.360
2319!

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:55.050
We have a 2319!

00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:56.270
Oh, dear.

00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:57.540
Get him!

00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.980
Sulley? Sulley!

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:03.960
( moaning )

00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:05.080
Sulley!

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.250
Oh, great news, pal.

00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:07.670
I got us a way out of this mess

00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:08.880
but we got to hurry.

00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.020
Where is it?

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.210
( whimpering )

00:47:12.330 --> 00:47:14.160
Sull, that's
a cube of garbage.

00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.580
( squeaks )

00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.790
Uh-oh.

00:47:16.940 --> 00:47:19.720
I-I can still hear
her little voice.

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.380
BOO:
Mike Wazowski!

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:22.760
Hey, I can hear her, too.

00:47:22.850 --> 00:47:24.380
BABY MONSTERS:
Mike Wazowski!

00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:26.110
How many kids
you got in there?

00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:28.040
Mike Wazowski!

00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:29.340
Kitty!

00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.020
Boo!

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:33.500
Boo, oh,
you're all right!

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:35.540
I was so worried!

00:47:35.630 --> 00:47:39.950
Don't you ever run away from me
again, young lady!

00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:42.820
Oh, but I'm so glad
you're safe.

00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:46.040
My, what an affectionate father.

00:47:46.170 --> 00:47:48.160
Actually, she's
my cousin's sister's...

00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:49.200
Okay, Sulley.

00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:50.270
That's enough.
Let's go.

00:47:50.370 --> 00:47:51.270
Mike Wazowski!

00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:52.340
Yeah, yeah.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:53.790
Step aside, kid.
We're in a...

00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:54.740
( screams in pain )

00:47:54.850 --> 00:47:55.650
( screams with laughter )

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:56.450
( electrical buzzing )

00:47:56.550 --> 00:47:57.510
( light bulbs shattering )

00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:58.740
( gasping )

00:47:58.820 --> 00:48:01.120
( baby monsters screaming
and crying )

00:48:01.250 --> 00:48:03.720
Will you stop
making Boo laugh?

00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:05.490
I didn't, so come on!

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:08.030
( screaming and crying
continue )

00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:09.220
I still don't understand.

00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.220
You've got Boo's door?

00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:11.230
I'II explain later.

00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:12.230
Run.

00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:13.640
Okay, let's move,
let's move, let's move.

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:14.760
Come on.

00:48:14.870 --> 00:48:16.690
Oh, please be there, please
be there, please be there.

00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.340
There it is!

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:19.370
Just like Randall said!

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:20.470
Randall?
What a minute.

00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:21.470
( cries out in fear )

00:48:21.510 --> 00:48:22.470
Oh, hey.

00:48:22.510 --> 00:48:23.410
One, two, three, four!

00:48:23.450 --> 00:48:24.410
Get the kid back
through the door!

00:48:24.450 --> 00:48:25.410
Hey, hey.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.630
We're going to get
our lives back.

00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:27.640
The nightmare is over.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:28.640
Hey, it's okay, Boo.

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:29.520
What's the matter?

00:48:29.550 --> 00:48:30.800
Come on, it's time to move!

00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:31.850
Mike, what are you thinking?

00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:32.850
We can't trust Randall.

00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:33.850
He's after Boo.

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.850
Who cares?
Let's go.

00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:35.950
This is a limited time offer.

00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:36.950
No, no.

00:48:37.090 --> 00:48:37.960
I don't like this.

00:48:38.060 --> 00:48:40.430
Look, Sulley, you wanted
her door and there it is.

00:48:40.530 --> 00:48:41.490
Now, let's move.

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.160
No, Mike.

00:48:43.270 --> 00:48:45.380
( sighs ):
You want me to prove
everything's on the up-and-up?

00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:47.070
Fine! He wants the door,
I get the door...

00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:47.940
( whispering ):
Mike, wait!

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.610
He's a paranoid delusional
furball.

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:53.180
Mike!

00:48:57.850 --> 00:48:59.290
( whimpers in fear )

00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:05.130
( whining )

00:49:05.190 --> 00:49:06.820
Shh, shh, shh.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:23.570
( small cry of surprise )

00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:44.580
( lunch bell rings )

00:49:52.310 --> 00:49:55.600
Hey, Sulley,
where you been all day?

00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.250
Sulley? Sulley?

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:12.660
Huh?

00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:14.140
( whispering ):
Mike?

00:50:14.230 --> 00:50:15.160
Mike?

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:17.950
Where are you?

00:50:18.070 --> 00:50:19.830
You in there?

00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:21.790
Where are you, buddy?

00:50:21.910 --> 00:50:22.900
Mike?

00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:24.320
Hey.

00:50:30.750 --> 00:50:32.190
( door thunks )

00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:35.130
( excited baby talk )

00:50:35.190 --> 00:50:36.720
Boo, way to go.

00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:37.780
( giggles )

00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.980
It's okay.

00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:52.070
( door clunks shut )

00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:06.160
( pipes whistling and venting )

00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.850
( distant voices )

00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.110
RANDALL:
Yes! I got the kid!

00:51:18.230 --> 00:51:19.640
FUNGUS:
Oh, huzzah!

00:51:19.700 --> 00:51:20.660
That's great news.

00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:22.530
Not that I was concerned,
of course.

00:51:22.670 --> 00:51:24.210
Just get over
here and help me!

00:51:24.270 --> 00:51:25.140
Come on, come
on, come on.

00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:26.200
While we're young
here, Fungus!

00:51:28.550 --> 00:51:30.850
( both straining )

00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:32.710
Kid needs to take
off a few pounds.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.780
( yelps )

00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.780
Wazowski?!

00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:40.200
Where is it,
you little one-eyed cretin?

00:51:40.320 --> 00:51:41.480
Okay, first of all,
it's cree-tin.

00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.480
If you're going
to threaten me

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:43.580
do it properly.

00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.710
Second of all, you're nuts
if you think kidnapping me

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:47.590
is going to help you cheat
your way to the top!

00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.040
( chuckling evilly )

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:53.330
You still think this is about
that stupid scare record?

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.770
Well... I did, right up
until you chuckled like that

00:51:56.910 --> 00:52:00.140
and now I'm thinking
I should just get out of here.

00:52:00.310 --> 00:52:03.580
I am about to revolutionize
the scaring industry

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:07.080
and when I do, even
the great James P. Sullivan

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:08.760
is going to be
working for me.

00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.910
MIKE:
Well

00:52:09.990 --> 00:52:12.230
somebody's certainly
been a busy bee.

00:52:12.360 --> 00:52:13.960
First, I need to know
where the kid is

00:52:14.060 --> 00:52:15.310
and you're going
to tell me.

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:16.580
Yeah, I don't
know anything.

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:17.590
Uh-huh, sure.

00:52:17.730 --> 00:52:18.600
MIKE:
I don't.

00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:19.790
I mean, I don't.

00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:21.210
Oh-oh.

00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.650
( mechanical clanging
and grinding )

00:52:22.770 --> 00:52:23.730
What's that?

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.080
Come on.
Wait, wait, wait.

00:52:25.210 --> 00:52:26.490
Oh-oh. Oh-oh.
Oh, come on.

00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.500
No, no, no, no, no.

00:52:27.610 --> 00:52:28.700
Come on,
hey, hey, hey.

00:52:28.810 --> 00:52:30.470
This thing is moving.

00:52:30.610 --> 00:52:32.560
I don't like big...

00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:34.860
moving things that are
moving towards me.

00:52:34.950 --> 00:52:36.390
No! Come on!

00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.890
Hey, Randall!

00:52:38.050 --> 00:52:41.160
Say hello
to the scream extractor.

00:52:41.290 --> 00:52:43.210
Hello.

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:44.540
Come on,
where you going?

00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:45.550
We'II talk.

00:52:45.630 --> 00:52:46.780
Come on,
we'II have a latte!

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:47.820
Come on.

00:52:47.930 --> 00:52:49.590
We can talk
about this.

00:52:49.670 --> 00:52:52.450
( electrical whirring starts,
then grows louder )

00:52:52.570 --> 00:52:55.290
What's that thing?
What is that thing?

00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:56.590
Wait, wait, wait!

00:52:56.670 --> 00:52:57.760
Stop, stop!

00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.150
No, no!

00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.200
Come on, hey!

00:53:00.280 --> 00:53:01.690
( deep, resonating whirring )

00:53:01.810 --> 00:53:03.480
Help! Help! Help!

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:04.510
Help!

00:53:04.610 --> 00:53:06.500
( yelling )

00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:10.990
( noise dies away )

00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:12.110
Oh, for...

00:53:12.220 --> 00:53:13.540
What did you
do wrong this time?

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:14.650
I don't know.

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:15.880
I calibrated the drive...

00:53:15.930 --> 00:53:17.370
Go check the machine!

00:53:17.430 --> 00:53:19.480
There must be something wrong
with the scream intake valve.

00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:22.160
That's the problem
with these 3250 units...

00:53:22.330 --> 00:53:24.250
Huh?

00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:29.160
Hmm.

00:53:39.390 --> 00:53:40.640
Psst!

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:42.260
Fungus.
Fungus.

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:44.430
You like cars, huh?

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:45.970
'Cause I got a really nice car.

00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.400
If you let me go,
I'II give you...

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:49.780
a ride in the car.

00:53:49.830 --> 00:53:51.240
Please, Fungus?

00:53:51.330 --> 00:53:53.060
I'm sorry, Wazowski,
but Randall said

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:55.860
I'm not allowed to fraternize
with victims of his evil plot.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:56.960
( gasps )

00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.450
( clanging )

00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:59.820
Hmm...

00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:01.800
( zapping )

00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.960
( electrical whirring )

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:07.150
( clanking, rattling, whirring )

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.240
( gasps )

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:09.240
( muff
ed screams )

00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:10.020
What happened?

00:54:10.090 --> 00:54:11.780
Where's Wazowski?

00:54:11.890 --> 00:54:13.520
( muff
ed screams )

00:54:13.590 --> 00:54:15.410
( shuts off machine )

00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.810
Where is he?!

00:54:16.890 --> 00:54:18.520
( whimpering )

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:19.680
( growls )

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.950
( whimpering )

00:54:21.130 --> 00:54:22.190
( squeals )

00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:23.480
Come on!

00:54:23.530 --> 00:54:25.070
This is crazy.
He's going to kill us!

00:54:25.170 --> 00:54:27.280
CDA AGENT 1 :
Careful.
That could be contaminated.

00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:28.880
We got to get out of here now!

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:31.440
We can start a whole new life
somewhere far away.

00:54:31.580 --> 00:54:32.820
Good-bye, Monsters, Inc.!

00:54:32.910 --> 00:54:34.700
Good-bye, Mr. Waternoose!

00:54:34.810 --> 00:54:36.190
No, Mike, wait!

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:37.620
Hey, what are you doing?

00:54:37.720 --> 00:54:39.190
Follow me. I have an idea.

00:54:39.250 --> 00:54:41.910
No! No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no...

00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:44.140
COMPUTER VOICE ( over PA ):
Simulation terminated.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:45.470
WATERNOOSE:
No, no, no, no, no.

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:46.610
What was that?

00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.410
You're trying to scare the kid,
not lull it to sleep.

00:54:49.560 --> 00:54:52.440
I was going for a
snake
ninja approach

00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:53.850
with a little hissing.

00:54:53.970 --> 00:54:54.860
( hisses )

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:57.330
How many times
do I have to tell you?

00:54:57.440 --> 00:54:59.070
It's all about presence!

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.130
About how you enter the room!

00:55:01.210 --> 00:55:02.620
Mr. Waternoose!

00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:04.600
James! Perfect timing.

00:55:04.750 --> 00:55:06.190
No, no. Sir, you
don't understand.

00:55:06.310 --> 00:55:08.170
Ah, now, show these monsters
how it's done.

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.210
What? No, no,
I can't...

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.280
Sir...
sir, you have

00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.250
to listen to me.

00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.310
Pay attention, everyone.

00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.320
You're about to see

00:55:13.420 --> 00:55:14.800
the best in
the business.

00:55:14.890 --> 00:55:15.820
Reset the simulator.

00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:16.820
But-but, sir!

00:55:16.890 --> 00:55:18.200
MOTHER:
Good night, sweetheart.

00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:19.610
ANIMATRONIC BOY:
Night, Mom.

00:55:19.690 --> 00:55:20.620
Kitty!

00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:21.750
No, Boo, no, no!

00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:23.460
Now, give us a big, loud roar.

00:55:23.570 --> 00:55:25.330
Mr. Waternoose,
there's no time for this.

00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:27.100
Come on. What are you
waiting for? Roar!

00:55:27.170 --> 00:55:28.070
But-but-but, sir!

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:28.940
Roar!

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.280
( groans )

00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:31.620
( roaring ferociously )

00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:33.180
( shrieking in terror )

00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:34.780
( gasps )

00:55:34.940 --> 00:55:35.970
( roaring ferociously )

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:37.130
( squeals )

00:55:37.180 --> 00:55:39.420
( Boo crying )

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.540
( students applauding )

00:55:40.620 --> 00:55:41.580
WATERNOOSE:
Well done.

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:43.350
Well done, James.

00:55:43.420 --> 00:55:44.860
Boo?

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.550
--All right, gentlemen,
I hope you've learned...
--Right this way, everyone.

00:55:47.690 --> 00:55:49.260
...a valuable lesson
in scaring today.

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:50.770
( fearful whimper )

00:55:50.860 --> 00:55:52.110
( whines softly )

00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:53.540
Boo.

00:55:53.660 --> 00:55:55.140
( nervous grunt )

00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:57.060
( whining )

00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:59.390
Boo?

00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:02.650
( panicked grunts )

00:56:02.770 --> 00:56:03.930
( door slams )

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.730
Boo, it's me.

00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:07.970
( squealing )

00:56:09.010 --> 00:56:10.520
( gasps ):
The child!

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:11.610
Sir, she isn't toxic.

00:56:11.680 --> 00:56:13.510
I know it sounds
crazy, but trust me.

00:56:13.650 --> 00:56:14.550
Boo?

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:15.680
No, no, no, no.

00:56:15.790 --> 00:56:16.690
It's okay.

00:56:16.790 --> 00:56:17.810
I was just...

00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:19.080
( whimpering in fear )

00:56:19.130 --> 00:56:21.050
No, no, no, no, no,
don't be scared.

00:56:21.130 --> 00:56:22.860
That wasn't real.

00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:24.050
It's just a...

00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:25.260
I was just...

00:56:25.330 --> 00:56:26.550
( crying ):
No...

00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:30.920
( Boo continues crying )

00:56:36.180 --> 00:56:37.590
( Boo sobbing )

00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:38.960
Boo.

00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:40.520
MIKE:
...and he was going
to test it out

00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.540
on that sweet,
little girl.

00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:44.380
--Boo.
--Now that we have her...

00:56:44.490 --> 00:56:45.670
...he is trying
to kill us.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:47.510
This whole thing
is Randall's fault.

00:56:47.590 --> 00:56:48.810
Randall?

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:51.320
Yes. And we can take you to his
secret lab, which is right here

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.390
in this factory.

00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:53.680
How could this happen?

00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.650
Oh, how could this happen?

00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.840
Does anyone else
know about this?

00:56:57.930 --> 00:56:58.890
No, sir.

00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:00.470
Good.

00:57:00.570 --> 00:57:03.390
This company can't afford
any more bad publicity.

00:57:03.540 --> 00:57:07.640
Now, before we do
anything else, let's...

00:57:07.810 --> 00:57:10.020
take care of the child.

00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:16.880
Oh, I never thought things
would come to this...

00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:19.930
not in my factory.

00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:23.260
I'm sorry you boys
got mixed up in this.

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:24.840
Especially you, James.

00:57:24.930 --> 00:57:26.630
But now we can set

00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:30.150
everything straight again
for the good of the company.

00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:31.420
( whirring )

00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:32.880
( thunk )

00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.060
MIKE:
Uh...

00:57:34.110 --> 00:57:36.310
sir, that's not her door.

00:57:36.480 --> 00:57:38.010
I know, I know.

00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:41.970
It's yours.

00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.170
( startled gasps )

00:57:43.250 --> 00:57:44.340
( grunts )

00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:46.530
( yelling )

00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.420
No!

00:57:48.620 --> 00:57:49.930
( gasps )

00:57:50.020 --> 00:57:54.020
( voice echoing ):
Boo!

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.290
( gasps )

00:57:58.360 --> 00:57:59.330
No! No!

00:57:59.370 --> 00:58:01.380
No! No! No! No!

00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:02.490
No!

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:03.820
( desperate grunts )

00:58:03.940 --> 00:58:04.900
lt's too late!

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:06.540
We're banished, genius.

00:58:06.610 --> 00:58:08.430
We're in the human world!

00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:11.840
Oh, what a great idea, going
to your old pal Waternoose!

00:58:11.980 --> 00:58:14.130
Too bad he was in
on the whole thing!

00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:17.800
All you had to do was listen
to me-- just once!

00:58:18.020 --> 00:58:20.130
But you didn't, did you?

00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:22.660
You're still not listening!

00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:25.510
( yelling )

00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:29.730
( Sulley grunting and groaning )

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:30.990
Take that!

00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:32.700
( growling )

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.440
( gasps in horror )

00:58:37.170 --> 00:58:39.480
Welcome to the Himalayas!

00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:41.910
( wind gusting )

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:43.650
''Abominable''!

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:44.680
( chuckles )

00:58:44.750 --> 00:58:45.970
Can you believe that?

00:58:46.050 --> 00:58:47.780
Do I look abominable to you?

00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:50.730
Why can't they call me
the Adorable Snowman or...

00:58:50.850 --> 00:58:53.580
or the Agreeable Snowman,
for crying out loud?

00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:54.980
I'm a nice guy.

00:58:55.060 --> 00:58:56.340
Snow cone?

00:58:56.430 --> 00:58:57.360
Yuck.

00:58:57.430 --> 00:58:58.360
No, no, no.

00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:59.970
Don't worry--
it's lemon.

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:02.180
Uh, how about
you, big fella?

00:59:02.270 --> 00:59:04.380
Snow cone?

00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:09.050
Did you see the way she...
looked at me?

00:59:09.310 --> 00:59:10.720
( sighs )

00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:12.600
Ah, poor guy.

00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:13.770
I understand.

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.450
lt ain't easy
being banished.

00:59:15.580 --> 00:59:16.900
Take my buddy, Bigfoot.

00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:18.140
When he was banished

00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:21.130
he fashioned an enormous diaper
out of poison ivy.

00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.150
Wore it on his head
like a tiara.

00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:24.790
Called himself King Itchy.

00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:27.580
Ah, it won't be so hard for
you guys, though, you know.

00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:29.170
I mean, how lucky
can you get?

00:59:29.230 --> 00:59:30.740
Banished with your
best friend.

00:59:30.830 --> 00:59:32.240
He is not my friend.

00:59:32.330 --> 00:59:34.220
Oh. I just assumed you
were buddies, you know

00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:35.840
when I saw you out
there in the snow

00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:36.870
hugging and all that.

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:37.990
Look at that big jerk.

00:59:38.070 --> 00:59:39.480
Ruined my life, and for what?

00:59:39.580 --> 00:59:40.660
A stupid kid!

00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:42.630
Because of you,
I am now stuck

00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:44.250
in this frozen
wasteland!

00:59:44.350 --> 00:59:45.310
Wasteland?

00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:47.720
I think you mean wonderland!

00:59:47.880 --> 00:59:50.250
I mean, how about
all this fabulous snow, huh?

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.880
Oh, and wait till you see
the local village.

00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:54.560
Cutest thing in the world.

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.870
I haven't even mentioned
all the free yak's milk.

00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.560
What... what did you say?

00:59:58.660 --> 00:59:59.590
Yak's milk.

00:59:59.660 --> 01:00:01.360
Milking a yak
ain't exactly a picnic.

01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:03.160
You know, once you pick
the hairs out

01:00:03.270 --> 01:00:04.230
it's very nutritious.

01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:05.680
No, no. Something
about a village.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.020
Where?
Are there kids in it?

01:00:07.070 --> 01:00:08.190
Kids? Sure.

01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:10.350
Tough kids, sissy kids,
kids who climb on rocks...

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.400
Where is it?!

01:00:11.480 --> 01:00:12.850
It's at the bottom
of the mountain.

01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.060
Around a three-day hike.

01:00:14.110 --> 01:00:15.420
Oh, three days?!

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.860
We need to get there now!

01:00:16.950 --> 01:00:17.910
( thump )

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:21.910
( ding )

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:29.720
You want to go to the village?

01:00:29.830 --> 01:00:32.130
Okay, rule number one
out here.

01:00:32.230 --> 01:00:33.320
Always...

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.460
No.

01:00:34.570 --> 01:00:36.740
Never go out in a blizzard.

01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:38.470
We need to get to Boo.

01:00:38.610 --> 01:00:39.950
( grunts, then gasps )

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:41.830
Boo?!

01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:43.280
What about us?

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:44.310
( grunts )

01:00:44.410 --> 01:00:46.010
Ever since that kid
came in

01:00:46.110 --> 01:00:47.520
you've ignored
everything I've said

01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.730
and now look where we are!

01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:52.380
Oh, we were about
to break the record, Sulley.

01:00:52.490 --> 01:00:53.930
We would have had it made!

01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:55.240
None of that matters now.

01:00:55.290 --> 01:00:57.790
None of it matter...

01:00:57.930 --> 01:00:59.110
Wa-wait a second.

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.340
None of it matters?

01:01:01.460 --> 01:01:02.970
( sighs )

01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:04.510
MIKE:
Okay.

01:01:04.570 --> 01:01:06.550
That's.... no. Good. Great.

01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:09.260
So, now the truth comes out,
doesn't it?

01:01:09.370 --> 01:01:12.540
Oh, would you
look at that?

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.470
We're out of
snow cones, uh...

01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:16.210
Let me... just go outside

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:17.560
and make some more.

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:21.870
Sulley, what about everything
we ever worked for?

01:01:22.090 --> 01:01:25.260
Does that matter?
Huh?

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:27.310
And what about Celia?

01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:31.140
I am never... never
going to see her again.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.800
Doesn't that matter?

01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:37.190
( sighs )

01:01:38.470 --> 01:01:39.850
What about me?

01:01:39.970 --> 01:01:41.510
I'm your pal.

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:43.620
I'm... I'm your best friend.

01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:45.790
Don't I matter?

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.220
( sighs )

01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.400
I'm sorry, Mike.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.330
I'm sorry we're stuck out here.

01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:55.570
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

01:01:55.690 --> 01:01:57.320
But Boo's in trouble.

01:01:57.460 --> 01:01:59.250
I think there might
be a way to save her

01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.900
if we can just
get down to that...

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:01.920
''We''?

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.760
Whoa, whoa, whoa. ''We''?

01:02:03.930 --> 01:02:05.150
No.

01:02:05.230 --> 01:02:07.250
There's no ''we'' this time, pal.

01:02:07.370 --> 01:02:09.540
I-if-if you want
to go out there

01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:10.950
and freeze to death

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:13.380
you be my guest...

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:16.320
because you're on your own.

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:34.650
* *

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.060
( wind whistles )

01:02:53.350 --> 01:02:55.850
Hey, I got more snow cones!

01:03:01.290 --> 01:03:02.220
Ohh!

01:03:07.170 --> 01:03:08.090
Ahh!

01:03:15.210 --> 01:03:15.660
Ahh!

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:16.640
( yells )

01:03:16.680 --> 01:03:19.720
( grunting and groaning )

01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:26.330
( wind howling )

01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:32.150
( distant child screaming )

01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:39.380
( children screaming )

01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:44.380
Oh, come on, now, George.

01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.980
I know you can do this.

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.240
I picked out an easy door
for you-- in Nepal.

01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:51.400
Nice, quiet Nepal.

01:03:51.550 --> 01:03:53.180
You know, you're right.

01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:54.430
Here, take this.

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.150
Go get 'em, Georgie!

01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.950
Gangway! Look out!
Coming through!

01:03:58.050 --> 01:03:59.300
Sorry, George.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:00.700
Hey, you can't just...

01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:01.720
( gasps )

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.720
23...

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.390
( gagging )

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.750
( whistling )

01:04:08.870 --> 01:04:10.020
Out of the way!

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.030
--Hey!
--Whoa!

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.570
Don't!

01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:14.240
( gasps )

01:04:14.310 --> 01:04:15.460
( whimpers )

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:16.720
Finally!

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:18.920
I never should have
trusted you with this.

01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:21.480
Because of you, I had
to banish my top scarer!

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:23.880
With this machine,
we won't need scarers.

01:04:24.020 --> 01:04:26.190
Besides, Sullivan got
what he deserved.

01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.260
Sullivan was twice the scarer
you will ever be!

01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:30.350
( low growl )

01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.580
( panting )

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:32.580
( clanging )

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:33.880
( grunting )

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:35.270
( yells with effort )

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:40.360
( mechanical whirring )

01:04:40.530 --> 01:04:42.070
( gasps )

01:04:42.270 --> 01:04:44.450
Kitty!

01:04:44.570 --> 01:04:45.600
( whirring and hissing )

01:04:45.710 --> 01:04:47.340
( yelling )

01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:48.720
( shrieking )

01:04:48.810 --> 01:04:49.900
( roaring )

01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.610
Kitty!

01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:53.350
Sullivan?

01:04:53.410 --> 01:04:54.630
( grunting )

01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.500
Wh-whoa!

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:00.840
Kitty!

01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:01.980
Sorry, Boo.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:03.430
Stop him!

01:05:03.530 --> 01:05:04.640
( growls )

01:05:04.730 --> 01:05:07.130
Let's get you home.

01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:07.840
( panting )

01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.820
( blow lands )

01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.860
Ooh!

01:05:09.930 --> 01:05:11.240
WATERNOOSE:
Finish him off!

01:05:11.330 --> 01:05:12.290
Oh! Ooh! Oh!

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.260
( clanging )

01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:16.630
( thunk )

01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:19.750
You don't know how long

01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.660
I've wanted to do
that, Sullivan.

01:05:22.810 --> 01:05:23.740
( grunts )

01:05:23.810 --> 01:05:24.770
( chuckles )

01:05:25.850 --> 01:05:27.480
( punches landing )

01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:28.510
Hah!

01:05:28.590 --> 01:05:29.450
Ooh!

01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:30.800
( shrieks )

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:33.670
( panting )

01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.680
Ooh!

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:35.880
Mike?!

01:05:35.930 --> 01:05:37.720
Look, it's not that I
don't care about the kid.

01:05:37.830 --> 01:05:39.050
Mike, you don't
understand.

01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:40.860
Yes, I do. I was
just mad, that's all.

01:05:40.930 --> 01:05:42.310
I needed some time to think.

01:05:42.430 --> 01:05:44.350
But you shouldn't
have left me out there.

01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:45.430
( thump )

01:05:45.470 --> 01:05:46.850
I'm being attacked!

01:05:46.940 --> 01:05:48.220
No, I'm not attacking you.

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.460
I'm trying to be honest.

01:05:49.510 --> 01:05:50.470
Just hear me out.

01:05:50.510 --> 01:05:51.690
You and I are a team.

01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:54.400
Nothing is more important
than our friendship.

01:05:54.510 --> 01:05:55.470
I-I-I know, kid.

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:56.600
He's too sensitive.

01:05:56.720 --> 01:05:58.320
( gagging )

01:05:58.380 --> 01:05:59.150
( whining cry )

01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:00.500
Come on, pal.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.190
If you start crying,
I'm going to cry

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:03.730
and I'II never get through this.

01:06:03.820 --> 01:06:06.320
I'm sorry
I wasn't there for you

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:07.390
but I am now.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:08.230
Ow!

01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.670
Sulley, I am baring
my soul here.

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.780
The least you could do
is pay attention!

01:06:12.930 --> 01:06:14.500
( yells in pain )

01:06:14.640 --> 01:06:16.560
( sighs in relief )

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.810
Hey, look at that--
it's Randall! It's...

01:06:18.910 --> 01:06:19.870
Oh.

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:21.120
Come on!

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.490
WATERNOOSE:
Get up!

01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.440
There can't be
any witnesses.

01:06:24.550 --> 01:06:25.760
There won't be.

01:06:26.210 --> 01:06:27.300
I'm glad you came back, Mike.

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.850
Somebody's got take care
of you, you big hairball.

01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:30.980
( Celia screaming )

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.620
( screaming )

01:06:32.790 --> 01:06:33.650
Ow!

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.680
Schmoopsie-poo,
I really can't talk.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.780
Come on!

01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:38.360
Michael, if you
don't tell me

01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:40.540
what's going on right
now, we are through!

01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:41.820
You hear me? Through!

01:06:41.900 --> 01:06:42.990
Here's the truth.

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.800
You know the kid that they're
looking for-- Sulley let her in.

01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:45.860
We tried to
send her back

01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:47.250
but Waternoose
had this secret plot

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:49.640
and now Randall's right behind
us and he's trying to kill us!

01:06:49.770 --> 01:06:52.940
You expect me to believe that
pack of lies, Mike Wazowski?!

01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:54.450
Mike Wazowski!

01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:55.730
( startled yell )

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:57.160
I love you, Schmoopsie-poo!

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.980
RANDALL:
Move it! Look out, you...

01:06:59.120 --> 01:06:59.820
Oh!

01:06:59.950 --> 01:07:00.820
...idiot!

01:07:00.950 --> 01:07:01.980
( huff'
ng )

01:07:02.050 --> 01:07:03.970
Look out. Coming through,
here, coming through!

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.340
Make way. Move it!

01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:06.640
Hurry up, hurry up.

01:07:06.760 --> 01:07:08.580
There they are!

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:11.480
Celia: ( over PA )
Attention, employees:
Randall Boggs

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:14.410
has just broken
the all-time scare record.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.500
Huh?

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:16.500
No, I didn't.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:17.660
Get out of my way!

01:07:17.700 --> 01:07:18.660
( clamoring )

01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:20.240
Go get 'em, Googley Bear!

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.430
( Boo shrieks )

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.590
There it is!

01:07:22.640 --> 01:07:24.180
RANDALL:
Get off my tail!

01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.370
Let me through!

01:07:29.350 --> 01:07:30.440
Sulley,
what are you doing?

01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:31.450
Grab on, Mike!

01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:32.570
Are you out of your...?

01:07:32.650 --> 01:07:33.900
( screaming )

01:07:37.020 --> 01:07:38.430
( whirring )

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:40.000
( Mike whimpering )

01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:43.510
MIKE:
Sulley, what are we doing?

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:46.770
We have to get Boo's door
and find a station.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:50.550
MIKE:
What a plan--
simple, yet insane!

01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.790
( growls )

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:54.220
Whoa.

01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:04.760
--( gasps )
--Oh, boy.

01:08:04.820 --> 01:08:06.650
Hold on!

01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.740
( Mike screaming )

01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:13.050
( screaming )

01:08:13.230 --> 01:08:14.830
( clinking )

01:08:14.970 --> 01:08:15.800
Wow!

01:08:15.870 --> 01:08:16.790
Don't look down!

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.690
( teeth chattering )

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:21.660
( rattling )

01:08:21.810 --> 01:08:22.700
( startled gasp )

01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:28.150
( screaming )

01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:31.840
( shrieking )

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.710
I'm gonna be sick.
I'm gonna be sick!

01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.740
Whoa!

01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:39.290
( screaming )

01:08:39.460 --> 01:08:40.480
Oh, no!

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:44.310
( chugging and clanking )

01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.710
No!

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:46.980
Aah...

01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.770
Boo's door?

01:08:47.830 --> 01:08:48.630
There it is!

01:08:48.670 --> 01:08:51.970
MIKE:
How are we supposed
to get to it now?

01:08:54.540 --> 01:08:56.750
Oh, it's a dead
end, Sulley!

01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:57.900
( gasps )

01:08:58.050 --> 01:08:59.200
MIKE:
There he is.

01:08:59.310 --> 01:09:00.270
Make her laugh.

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:01.050
What, Sulley?!

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:01.690
Just do it!

01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:03.510
Oh... ow!

01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:04.610
( laughing )

01:09:04.650 --> 01:09:06.220
( squealing laughter )

01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:09.840
( engines starting )

01:09:09.990 --> 01:09:12.170
SULLIVAN:
Get it open.

01:09:12.330 --> 01:09:13.900
Here he comes.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.040
Give me that kid!

01:09:16.170 --> 01:09:18.600
( birds twittering )

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:19.980
( Boo giggling )

01:09:20.070 --> 01:09:22.090
Why couldn't we
get banished here?

01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:24.350
Come on. We got to
find another door.

01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:26.440
( gasps )

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.700
Look, Boo's door!

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:35.110
( grunting )

01:09:36.050 --> 01:09:36.950
There he is!

01:09:37.050 --> 01:09:38.240
Hurry up, hurry up!

01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.830
Give me your hand.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.800
( screaming )

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:43.960
( grunts )

01:09:45.730 --> 01:09:47.070
Come on, it slides,
it slides!

01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:48.190
Ooh, right, right, right.

01:09:48.330 --> 01:09:49.580
( panting )

01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:52.340
( gasps )

01:09:52.440 --> 01:09:53.850
Jump!
I'm behind you!

01:09:58.840 --> 01:09:59.800
Come on!

01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:03.990
Hurry up! Keep moving!

01:10:04.050 --> 01:10:05.330
Get inside!

01:10:05.450 --> 01:10:07.310
Ooh! That was weird.

01:10:07.450 --> 01:10:08.350
( grunts )

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:09.740
Mike?

01:10:09.890 --> 01:10:11.270
Oh, sorry, buddy.

01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.540
( stunned mumbling )

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:16.440
( growls )

01:10:17.530 --> 01:10:18.780
( electronic whirring )

01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:19.790
Oh!

01:10:19.870 --> 01:10:21.950
I hope that hurt, lizard boy!

01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:23.670
( laughing )

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:28.780
Great job, buddy.
We lost him.

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.810
( squeals )

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:30.810
Boo!

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:31.810
Ha, ha!

01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:32.810
No!

01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:35.120
( screaming )

01:10:35.250 --> 01:10:36.880
Nice working with you!

01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:37.920
Get it open!

01:10:38.050 --> 01:10:39.650
--I'm trying!
--Open the door!

01:10:39.790 --> 01:10:41.260
Come on, get in here!

01:10:44.590 --> 01:10:46.070
( Boo crying )

01:10:48.130 --> 01:10:50.630
( grunting )

01:10:50.770 --> 01:10:51.980
Boo!

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.340
( panting )

01:10:55.570 --> 01:10:56.530
There they are!

01:11:00.710 --> 01:11:02.410
Sulley, what are you doing?

01:11:02.510 --> 01:11:03.860
Sulley!

01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:04.870
( Sulley grunts )

01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.880
( Mike grunts )

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:06.880
( yells )

01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:09.640
Looks like we caught
the express, pal.

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:10.850
Do you see them?

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.430
Straight ahead!

01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:15.710
No...

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.720
( stifled cry )

01:11:24.300 --> 01:11:26.320
( grunting nervously )

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:37.220
Kitty!

01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:38.310
Boo!

01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:39.880
( yelling )

01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:42.990
( whimpering )

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:47.770
RANDALL:
Look at everybody's
favorite scarer now!

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.400
You stupid, pathetic waste!

01:11:50.500 --> 01:11:51.460
( thump )

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:56.580
You've been number one
for too long, Sullivan.

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:58.790
Now your time is up!

01:11:58.870 --> 01:12:00.730
And don't worry.

01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.880
I'II take good care of the kid.

01:12:04.050 --> 01:12:04.940
No!

01:12:04.980 --> 01:12:06.610
( yelling )

01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:09.690
( Boo grunting
and Randall gagging )

01:12:09.850 --> 01:12:11.550
( Randall groaning )

01:12:22.470 --> 01:12:24.450
( gagging )

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:26.330
( roaring angrily )

01:12:26.440 --> 01:12:28.550
She's not scared
of you anymore.

01:12:28.710 --> 01:12:30.180
( roars angrily )

01:12:30.310 --> 01:12:32.390
Looks like you're out of a job.

01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.700
( gulps )

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:34.840
All right, come on,
over the plate.

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:36.000
Let's see
the ol' stuff here, pal.

01:12:36.150 --> 01:12:37.720
Come on, now, chuck him,
chuck him, baby. Hum, baby.

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:38.840
Hum, baby,
here's the pitch.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:40.200
Wait, please, don't,
don't, don't!

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:41.050
No!

01:12:41.220 --> 01:12:42.050
And he is...
out of here!

01:12:42.190 --> 01:12:43.400
( crickets chirping )

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:45.950
BOY:
Mama, another gator
got in the house.

01:12:46.090 --> 01:12:47.020
Another gator?!

01:12:47.090 --> 01:12:48.950
Give me that shovel!
Come here!

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:50.470
( clanging, yelling )

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:52.420
Get him, mama!
Get that gator!

01:12:53.530 --> 01:12:54.940
Care to do the honors,
Mikey?

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:57.760
With pleasure.

01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.340
( thud )

01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:05.790
( baby talk )

01:13:05.880 --> 01:13:07.160
That's right, Boo.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:08.340
You did it.

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:09.540
You beat him.

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:10.540
( raspberry )

01:13:10.590 --> 01:13:11.990
Come on.

01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:16.340
Okay, Boo,
it's time to go home.

01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.630
Take care of yourself,
and be a good girl, okay?

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:19.850
( gasps )

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:21.050
Oh, no!

01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.020
The power's out!

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:23.470
Make her laugh again.

01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:24.850
All right, I got a move here.

01:13:24.930 --> 01:13:26.210
It'II bring down the house.

01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:27.360
Up...

01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:28.530
( metallic clang )

01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:29.730
( groans softly )

01:13:29.810 --> 01:13:32.010
Oh, sorry, she didn't see that.

01:13:32.170 --> 01:13:33.710
What?! What'd you do,
forget to check

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:35.060
if her stupid hood was up

01:13:35.210 --> 01:13:36.300
ya big dope?!

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:38.560
( singsong ):
Uncle Mike, try not to yell
in front of her.

01:13:38.650 --> 01:13:40.180
You know we still need her
to laugh.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:41.210
Right.

01:13:41.290 --> 01:13:42.210
( laughs )

01:13:42.290 --> 01:13:43.920
Hey, Boo, just kidding. Look!

01:13:43.990 --> 01:13:44.950
( gibberish )

01:13:44.990 --> 01:13:46.530
Funny, right? Huh?
See what the...

01:13:46.590 --> 01:13:47.650
These are the jokes, kid.

01:13:47.790 --> 01:13:48.850
Whoa!

01:13:48.930 --> 01:13:50.720
What's happening?

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.840
SULLIVAN:
Hold on!

01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:56.140
When the door lands
in this station, cut the power.

01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:59.210
You'II have the child
and the criminals responsible

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.710
for this whole mess.

01:14:01.810 --> 01:14:03.700
Great.
A welcoming committee!

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:05.570
What are we going to do?!

01:14:05.710 --> 01:14:09.230
( electrical humming )

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:13.220
( clang )

01:14:17.290 --> 01:14:18.380
This is the CDA.

01:14:18.460 --> 01:14:19.550
Come out slowly

01:14:19.630 --> 01:14:21.190
with the child
in plain sight.

01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:23.500
Okay, okay.

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:24.590
You got us.

01:14:24.630 --> 01:14:25.720
Here we are.

01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:26.730
Here's the kid.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:28.270
I'm cooperating.

01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:30.230
But before you take us away,
I have one thing to say:

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:31.270
( gags )

01:14:31.340 --> 01:14:32.680
Catch!

01:14:32.770 --> 01:14:34.690
( all shouting ):
2319!

01:14:34.810 --> 01:14:36.410
We have a toxic
projectile!

01:14:36.550 --> 01:14:38.080
Halt! After the suspect!

01:14:38.150 --> 01:14:39.550
Cover the area!
Bring in reinforcements!

01:14:39.650 --> 01:14:41.150
WATERNOOSE:
Stop him!

01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:43.740
( Boo squeaks )

01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:45.040
Come on.

01:14:45.150 --> 01:14:47.300
Don't let them get away.

01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:48.350
What...?!

01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:49.540
No, wait, wait!

01:14:49.590 --> 01:14:51.190
Come back!
He has the child!

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.540
( frustrated growl )

01:14:54.730 --> 01:14:56.460
( Boo squeaks )

01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:59.000
Sullivan? Sullivan!

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:00.700
Give me the child!

01:15:00.770 --> 01:15:01.920
Me not go!

01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:02.900
Give her to me!

01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:06.320
( panting )

01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.850
( grunts )

01:15:09.780 --> 01:15:11.540
( metallic creaking )

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:16.000
WATERNOOSE:
Open this door!
Open this door!

01:15:16.190 --> 01:15:17.850
( growling and pounding )

01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:19.750
Hey!

01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:21.330
Sullivan!

01:15:21.390 --> 01:15:22.260
( yells )

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.030
WATERNOOSE:
Don't do it.

01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:24.870
( beep )

01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.700
Come on.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.710
Don't go in that room!

01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:30.400
( yelling )

01:15:30.540 --> 01:15:32.780
I think we stopped him, Boo.

01:15:32.910 --> 01:15:33.990
You're safe now.

01:15:34.070 --> 01:15:37.240
You be a good girl, okay?

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:39.880
This has gone
far enough, James.

01:15:39.980 --> 01:15:41.320
She's home now!
Just leave her alone!

01:15:41.410 --> 01:15:42.530
I can't do that!

01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:43.670
She's seen too much.

01:15:43.750 --> 01:15:45.350
You both have.

01:15:45.450 --> 01:15:46.800
It doesn't have to be this way.

01:15:46.850 --> 01:15:48.460
I have no choice!

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.580
Times have changed.

01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:51.260
Scaring isn't enough anymore.

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.740
But kidnapping children?!

01:15:52.830 --> 01:15:54.360
I'II kidnap
a thousand children

01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:55.900
before I let
this company die

01:15:56.000 --> 01:15:57.730
and I'II silence anyone

01:15:57.830 --> 01:15:59.630
who gets in my way!

01:15:59.730 --> 01:16:01.010
No!

01:16:01.070 --> 01:16:03.370
( child@s voice ):
Good night, Mom.

01:16:03.470 --> 01:16:05.170
( woman@s voice ):
Good night, sweetheart.

01:16:05.240 --> 01:16:06.140
Good night, Mom.

01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.450
What, wh-what is this?!
What? Who? Huh?

01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.820
COMPUTER:
Simulation terminated.
Simulation terminated.

01:16:10.910 --> 01:16:12.900
Well, I don't know
about the rest of you guys

01:16:12.980 --> 01:16:14.900
but I spotted
several big mistakes.

01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.430
But-but-but how-how did...?
How did...?

01:16:16.490 --> 01:16:17.640
MIKE:
You know what?

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:20.440
Let's watch my favorite part
again... shall we?

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.600
( repeating ):
I'II kidnap a thousand children
before I let this company die.

01:16:23.790 --> 01:16:25.590
What...? Wha...?

01:16:25.700 --> 01:16:27.620
I'II kidnap
a thousand children before...

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.110
( baby talk )

01:16:29.230 --> 01:16:30.610
Shh, shh, shh, shh!

01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:32.210
Shh!

01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:33.230
I'II get him.

01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:34.390
All right,
come with us, sir.

01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:35.490
Wh-what are
you doing?

01:16:35.640 --> 01:16:36.600
Take your
hands off me!

01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:37.700
You can't
arrest me!

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:38.990
I hope you're happy, Sullivan!

01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:41.220
You've destroyed this company.
Monsters, Incorporated is dead!

01:16:41.350 --> 01:16:43.870
Where will everyone
get their scream now?!

01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:46.260
The energy crisis
will only get worse

01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:47.920
because of you!

01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:49.300
( loud clang )

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.300
Stay where you are.

01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:54.350
Huh?

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.770
Number One
wants to talk to you.

01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:57.910
Attention!

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:05.990
Hello, boys.

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:07.070
BOTH:
Roz?!

01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:10.950
Two and a half years
of undercover work

01:17:11.150 --> 01:17:13.030
were almost wasted

01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:16.600
when you intercepted
that child, Mr. Sullivan.

01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:20.210
Of course, without your help,
I never would have known

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:23.170
that this went all the way up
to Waternoose.

01:17:23.320 --> 01:17:25.050
( baby talk )

01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.700
( gasps )

01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.980
ROZ:
Now...

01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:29.670
about the girl...

01:17:29.730 --> 01:17:32.840
I just want to
send her home.

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:34.160
Very good.

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:35.320
( chiming tones )

01:17:35.370 --> 01:17:37.100
Bring me a door shredder.

01:17:37.170 --> 01:17:40.280
What, you mean... you mean,
I can't see her again?

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:43.670
That's the way it has to be.

01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:46.820
I'II give you
five minutes.

01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:53.300
( whirring hum )

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:59.100
Well, so long, kid.

01:17:59.230 --> 01:18:01.150
Mike Wazowski!

01:18:01.230 --> 01:18:02.670
Yeah.

01:18:02.730 --> 01:18:07.790
Ah, Boo,
it's been fun.

01:18:08.010 --> 01:18:09.350
Go ahead.

01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:11.810
Go grow up.

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.870
( door creaking )

01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:24.860
( squealing in delight )

01:18:24.960 --> 01:18:26.110
( laughing )

01:18:30.630 --> 01:18:31.560
Uh-uh, B-Boo...?

01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:32.560
( speaking baby talk )

01:18:32.630 --> 01:18:33.720
Um... Boo?

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:35.210
( speaking baby talk )

01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.420
Oh, look at that.

01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:38.680
Yeah, you know...

01:18:38.810 --> 01:18:40.500
Oh, that's cute, yeah.

01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:41.630
( baby talk )

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:42.830
Uh, Boo, um...

01:18:42.910 --> 01:18:43.840
( squeaking toy )

01:18:43.910 --> 01:18:45.350
Well, that's very nice.

01:18:45.450 --> 01:18:47.180
( giggling )

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.630
Come here, you!

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.900
( squeals )

01:18:50.050 --> 01:18:52.000
( both laughing )

01:18:56.760 --> 01:18:59.510
* Oh, he's a happy bear... *

01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.230
( giggling )

01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:03.350
( baby talk )

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.090
Nothing's coming
out of your closet

01:19:07.170 --> 01:19:08.680
to scare you
anymore, right?

01:19:08.770 --> 01:19:09.830
Mm...

01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:12.280
Yeah.

01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.750
Good-bye, Boo.

01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:17.500
Kitty.

01:19:17.620 --> 01:19:19.660
Kitty has to go.

01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:38.880
* *

01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:02.210
Boo!

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:04.510
( gasps )

01:20:04.600 --> 01:20:07.610
Kitty?

01:20:07.770 --> 01:20:10.010
( motor buzzing loudly )

01:20:13.740 --> 01:20:14.930
( clicks off )

01:20:15.010 --> 01:20:16.350
None of this

01:20:16.410 --> 01:20:19.290
ever happened, gentlemen.

01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:23.930
And I don't want to see
any paperwork on this.

01:20:26.490 --> 01:20:28.600
( door closes )

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.920
Take him away.

01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:49.930
( all murmuring )

01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:51.970
I bet we get
the rest of the day off.

01:20:52.050 --> 01:20:53.200
You idiot!

01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:55.300
They're going to shut down
the factory!

01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:57.120
( all gasp )

01:20:57.190 --> 01:20:59.210
I'm telling you, pal,
when that wall went up

01:20:59.320 --> 01:21:01.730
you should have seen the look
on Waternoose's face.

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:03.970
Whoo-hoo! I hope we get
a copy of that tape.

01:21:04.100 --> 01:21:05.280
Hey, you all right?

01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:07.410
Come on, pal,
cheer up, we did it!

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:08.560
We got Boo home.

01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:10.850
Ah, sure, we put the factory
in the toilet, and...

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.340
gee, hundreds of people
will be out of work now.

01:21:13.540 --> 01:21:15.750
Not to mention the angry mob
that'II come after us

01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:17.670
when there's no more power,
but, hey...

01:21:17.810 --> 01:21:20.690
at least we had
some laughs, right?

01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:25.740
Laughs...

01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:27.130
( crickets chirping )

01:21:27.260 --> 01:21:28.950
( wind blowing softly )

01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:31.750
( door quietly creaks open )

01:21:41.370 --> 01:21:42.550
( boy gasps )

01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:46.640
Hey, is this thing on?
Hello?

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:48.310
Hello?
Testing, testing.

01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.790
Hey, good evening.
How are you?

01:21:49.850 --> 01:21:51.190
How are you?
Nice to see you.

01:21:51.310 --> 01:21:53.270
I tell you, it's good
to be here in... your room.

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:54.500
Where you from?

01:21:54.580 --> 01:21:55.800
Never mind.

01:21:55.890 --> 01:21:57.810
You're in
kindergarten, right?

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.010
Oh, I love kindergarten.

01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:00.790
Best three years of my life.

01:22:01.890 --> 01:22:03.240
Of my life.

01:22:03.330 --> 01:22:04.260
But I love sports.

01:22:04.330 --> 01:22:05.580
Dodgeball
was the best.

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:06.590
Oh, yeah.

01:22:06.660 --> 01:22:08.040
I was the fastest one out there.

01:22:08.130 --> 01:22:09.800
Course I was the ball.

01:22:09.900 --> 01:22:11.600
But I...

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:13.210
was the ball, see?

01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:14.880
All right.

01:22:19.110 --> 01:22:20.680
( rumbling )

01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:22.320
( rumbling gets louder )

01:22:22.380 --> 01:22:23.530
( gurgling )

01:22:23.580 --> 01:22:25.500
Ah...

01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:26.830
( huge burp )

01:22:26.890 --> 01:22:28.010
Ah?

01:22:28.050 --> 01:22:29.620
( laughing )

01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.810
Hey, thanks a lot.

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.050
I'II be here all week.

01:22:32.090 --> 01:22:33.790
Remember to tip your waitresses.

01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:35.620
( guffawing )

01:22:35.730 --> 01:22:37.010
( rippling gurgle )

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.410
( bell dings )

01:22:38.470 --> 01:22:39.620
Great job, Mikey.

01:22:39.730 --> 01:22:41.810
You filled your quota on
the first kid of the day.

01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:43.060
Not bad, huh?

01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.280
You know, only somebody
with perfect comedic timing

01:22:45.410 --> 01:22:47.200
could produce this much energy
in one shot.

01:22:47.310 --> 01:22:48.750
Uh-huh, and the fact
that laughter is

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.290
ten times more
powerful than scream

01:22:50.380 --> 01:22:51.440
had nothing to do with it.

01:22:51.550 --> 01:22:52.670
( clears throat )

01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:53.960
CELIA:
Oh, Googley Bear.

01:22:54.010 --> 01:22:56.290
Come here, you.

01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:57.350
Schmoopsie-poo!

01:22:57.420 --> 01:22:58.380
Googley.

01:22:58.450 --> 01:22:59.540
Whoa!

01:22:59.620 --> 01:23:00.710
( snakes chittering )

01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:01.850
( Mike giggling )

01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:02.950
Girls!
Girls, put...

01:23:03.060 --> 01:23:05.200
Stop, stop, stop!

01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:07.600
Michael,
you're such a charmer.

01:23:07.730 --> 01:23:09.040
Hey, did you bring
the magazine?

01:23:09.100 --> 01:23:10.410
They just delivered
a whole box.

01:23:10.470 --> 01:23:11.430
Let me see it!

01:23:11.470 --> 01:23:12.520
( laughing )

01:23:12.670 --> 01:23:14.110
Sulley and I
made the cover, right?

01:23:14.240 --> 01:23:17.440
( whispering ):
I don't believe it.

01:23:17.670 --> 01:23:19.210
( sympathetically ):
Googley Bear...

01:23:19.310 --> 01:23:22.480
I'm on the cover
of a magazine!

01:23:22.710 --> 01:23:24.060
Ow!

01:23:24.110 --> 01:23:25.490
( chattering )

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.650
( jittering blubbers )

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.740
Oh, this is great!

01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:33.260
( humming happily )

01:23:33.390 --> 01:23:35.090
( child laughing uproariously )

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.320
( bell dings )

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:39.020
Oh.

01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:44.200
( distant laughter )

01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:45.710
( kazoo whirs )

01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.600
( toy horn toots )

01:23:57.150 --> 01:23:58.270
MIKE:
Hey, Sulley!

01:23:58.320 --> 01:23:59.730
( yells )

01:23:59.850 --> 01:24:00.910
Hey, uh, Mike.
I was, uh, just...

01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:02.080
Well, listen,
if you got a minute

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:03.530
there's something
I want to show you.

01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:04.550
But-but-but...

01:24:04.590 --> 01:24:05.550
Okay, close
your eyes.

01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:06.650
Follow me.
Come on.

01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.660
I-I-I...

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:08.850
No peeking.

01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:10.450
Keep coming, keep coming,
keep coming.

01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:11.590
Come on,
keep coming.

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.790
Keep coming,
keep coming.

01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:13.960
Mike...

01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:15.540
Follow the sultry
sound of my voice.

01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:16.600
Okay, stop.

01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.600
Open them.

01:24:18.840 --> 01:24:20.570
Ta-da!

01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.310
Mike...

01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.630
Is that...?

01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:24.930
Sorry it took

01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:26.100
so long, pal.

01:24:26.220 --> 01:24:28.580
It was a lot of wood
to go through.

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.250
You know,
it only works

01:24:30.350 --> 01:24:32.270
if you have
every piece.

01:24:45.640 --> 01:24:47.400
( whirring hum )

01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:59.050
( creaking )

01:24:59.150 --> 01:25:01.260
Boo?

01:25:01.350 --> 01:25:03.050
BOO:
Kitty!

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:15.290
( bouncy blues melody plays )

01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:19.060
Sulley:
* If I were a rich man *

01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:23.150
* With a million or two *

01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:26.130
Mike:
* I'd live in
a penthouse *

01:25:26.350 --> 01:25:30.730
* In a room
with a view *

01:25:30.950 --> 01:25:32.740
* And if I were handsome *

01:25:32.820 --> 01:25:33.780
No way.

01:25:33.820 --> 01:25:34.970
It could happen.

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:39.160
* Those dreams
do come true *

01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:43.200
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:47.150
* Wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

01:25:47.370 --> 01:25:50.890
* Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:53.310
* Wouldn't have nothing *

01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:54.980
Can I tell
you something?

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:57.250
* For years
I have envied *

01:25:57.410 --> 01:25:58.440
You were green with it.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:02.230
* Your grace
and your charm *

01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:07.090
* Everyone loves
you, you know *

01:26:07.290 --> 01:26:10.460
* Yes, I know,
I know, I know *

01:26:10.630 --> 01:26:13.830
* But I must admit it *

01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:18.260
* Big guy, you
always come through *

01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:23.500
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

01:26:26.010 --> 01:26:29.560
BOTH:
* You and me together *

01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:33.430
* That's how it
always should be *

01:26:33.590 --> 01:26:39.440
* One without the other
don't mean nothing to me *

01:26:39.690 --> 01:26:44.210
* Nothing to me *

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:46.000
* Yeah, I wouldn't
be nothing *

01:26:46.130 --> 01:26:47.670
* No *

01:26:47.740 --> 01:26:51.190
* If I didn't
have you to serve *

01:26:51.370 --> 01:26:55.150
* I'm just a punky
little eyeball *

01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:58.930
* And a funky
optic nerve *

01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:02.790
* Hey, I never
told you this *

01:27:03.050 --> 01:27:05.550
* Sometimes I get
a little blue *

01:27:05.650 --> 01:27:07.220
Looks good on you.

01:27:07.290 --> 01:27:09.500
* But I wouldn't
have nothing *

01:27:09.660 --> 01:27:12.570
* If I didn't
have you... *

01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:16.060
Let's dance.

01:27:16.230 --> 01:27:18.340
Look, Ma,
I'm dancing!

01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:22.860
Would you let me lead?

01:27:22.970 --> 01:27:24.540
Look at that.
It's true.

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:26.760
Big guys are light
on their feet.

01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:28.000
Don't you dare dip me.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:30.350
Don't you dare dip me,
don't you dare dip me.

01:27:30.450 --> 01:27:32.400
Ow. I should
have stretched.

01:27:32.520 --> 01:27:35.810
* Yes, I wouldn't
be nothing *

01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.390
* If I didn't have you *

01:27:38.490 --> 01:27:39.870
I know what you
mean, Sulley.

01:27:39.990 --> 01:27:40.890
* Because... *

01:27:40.990 --> 01:27:42.400
* I wouldn't know
where to go *

01:27:42.460 --> 01:27:43.740
* Me, too,
because I... *

01:27:43.800 --> 01:27:45.910
* Wouldn't know
what to do *

01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:47.660
Why do you keep
singing my part?

01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:50.490
BOTH:
* I don't have to say it *

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.760
Ah, say it anyway.

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:52.760
* 'Cause we... *

01:27:52.810 --> 01:27:55.430
* Both know it's true *

01:27:55.540 --> 01:28:00.050
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:03.900
* I wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

01:28:04.050 --> 01:28:08.280
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:14.540
* Wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you. *

01:28:14.790 --> 01:28:15.760
( music ends )

01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.780
One more time.

01:28:17.930 --> 01:28:19.630
( music begins again )

01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:20.600
lt worked!

01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:22.460
* I don't have
to say it *

01:28:22.540 --> 01:28:23.850
Where'd everybody
come from?

01:28:23.970 --> 01:28:25.990
* 'Cause we both
know it's true *

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:28.000
Let's take it
home, big guy.

01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:32.020
BOTH:
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have *

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:35.770
* I wouldn't have nothing if I
didn't have *

01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:41.010
* I wouldn't have nothing
if I didn't have you *

01:28:41.220 --> 01:28:43.240
* You, you *

01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:45.380
* A, E, I, O... *

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.220
* That means you, yeah. *
