00:01:12.912 --> 00:01:16.456
Pull yourself together, Teddy.
Pull yourself together.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.547
It's just water.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.717
It's a lot of water.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.052
A lot of ...

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:34.682
Come on.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.876
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm fine, I just ...

00:02:02.837 --> 00:02:05.755
I just can't ...
Can't stomach the water.

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:11.928
- You're my new partner.
- That's right.

00:02:13.013 --> 00:02:16.015
Not the best way to meet,
with my head halfway down the toilet.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.144
Doesn't exactly square with
"Teddy Daniels, the man, the legend,"

00:02:19.228 --> 00:02:21.688
- I'll give you that.
- The legend?

00:02:21.772 --> 00:02:24.440
What the hell you boys smoking
over there in Portland, anyway?

00:02:24.525 --> 00:02:27.902
Seattle. I came from
the office in Seattle.

00:02:30.614 --> 00:02:32.782
How long you been with the Marshals?

00:02:32.867 --> 00:02:34.284
Four years.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.204
So you know how small it is.

00:02:38.622 --> 00:02:39.706
Sure.

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.710
What about you?
You got a girl? Married?

00:02:44.545 --> 00:02:45.795
I was.

00:02:57.892 --> 00:02:59.267
She died.

00:02:59.894 --> 00:03:03.229
- Jesus. I don't ...
- Don't worry about it.

00:03:04.273 --> 00:03:07.859
There was a fire at the apartment
building while I was at work.

00:03:07.943 --> 00:03:09.652
Four people died.

00:03:09.737 --> 00:03:13.573
It was the smoke that got her,
not the fire. See, that's important.

00:03:13.657 --> 00:03:15.366
I'm sorry, boss.

00:03:15.451 --> 00:03:18.244
Where are my goddamn cigarettes?

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.413
Oh, here, have one of mine.

00:03:20.497 --> 00:03:24.000
I could've sworn they were
in my jacket before I got on.

00:03:24.084 --> 00:03:26.794
Government employees
will rob you blind.

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:30.465
Thanks.

00:03:31.508 --> 00:03:34.260
They give you a briefing about
the institution before you left?

00:03:34.345 --> 00:03:37.013
All I know is it's a mental hospital.

00:03:37.848 --> 00:03:39.432
For the criminally insane.

00:03:40.976 --> 00:03:43.144
Well, if it's just folks running
around hearing voices ...

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:46.689
and chasing after butterflies,
they wouldn't need us.

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:58.701
- Is that where we're headed?
- Yep.

00:03:59.203 --> 00:04:01.579
The other side of the island
is rock bluffs ...

00:04:01.664 --> 00:04:04.207
all the way down
to the edge of the water.

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:07.752
The dock,
it's the only way on or off.

00:04:08.837 --> 00:04:11.798
We'll be casting off
as soon as you two are ashore.

00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:14.509
I'd appreciate it
if you'd hurry up about it.

00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:17.345
- Why?
- Storm's coming.

00:04:43.747 --> 00:04:46.374
Never seen a Marshals badge before.

00:04:48.043 --> 00:04:49.919
I'm Deputy Warden McPherson,
gentlemen.

00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:51.170
Welcome to Shutter Island.

00:04:51.255 --> 00:04:54.299
I'll be the one taking you
up to Ashecliffe.

00:05:06.603 --> 00:05:09.480
Your boys seem a little on edge,
Mr. McPherson.

00:05:09.565 --> 00:05:11.941
Right now, Marshal, we all are.

00:05:55.986 --> 00:05:58.237
Electrified perimeter.

00:06:00.074 --> 00:06:01.824
How can you tell?

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:04.744
I've seen something like it before.

00:06:33.273 --> 00:06:37.193
All right. You gentlemen will be
accorded all the help we can give,

00:06:37.277 --> 00:06:40.238
but during your stay,
you will obey protocol.

00:06:40.322 --> 00:06:41.697
Is that understood?

00:06:41.782 --> 00:06:43.157
Absolutely.

00:06:43.617 --> 00:06:46.953
The red brick building on your
right is Ward A, the male ward.

00:06:47.037 --> 00:06:50.415
Ward B, the female ward,
is the one on your left.

00:06:50.499 --> 00:06:53.459
Ward C is that building
on the bluffs.

00:06:53.544 --> 00:06:55.128
An old Civil War fort.

00:06:55.212 --> 00:06:57.630
The most dangerous patients
are housed there.

00:06:57.714 --> 00:06:59.632
Admittance to Ward C is forbidden ...

00:06:59.716 --> 00:07:02.385
without the written consent
and physical presence ...

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:05.012
of both myself and Dr. Cawley.

00:07:05.097 --> 00:07:06.889
Is that understood?

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.268
You act like insanity is catching.

00:07:13.147 --> 00:07:16.399
You are hereby required
to surrender your firearms.

00:07:17.901 --> 00:07:21.279
Mr. McPherson, we are duly appointed
federal marshals.

00:07:21.363 --> 00:07:23.865
We are required to carry our firearms
with us at all times.

00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:26.951
Executive order 319 of the
Federal Code of Penitentiaries ...

00:07:27.035 --> 00:07:29.078
states that when inside a penitentiary,

00:07:29.163 --> 00:07:32.582
the officers of that institution
have final authority.

00:07:35.461 --> 00:07:39.464
Gentlemen, you will not get through
this gate with your firearms.

00:07:58.901 --> 00:08:02.195
Okay. Now that the official
stuff's done, come on, boys,

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:04.238
what do you say we go find Dr. Cawley?

00:08:16.293 --> 00:08:18.961
When did she escape? This prisoner?

00:08:19.046 --> 00:08:23.216
I'm afraid Dr. Cawley will have to
fill you in on the situation. Protocol.

00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.426
Correctional officers
at a mental institution,

00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:27.678
that's a weird sight,
if you don't mind me saying.

00:08:27.763 --> 00:08:31.182
It's the only facility of its
kind in the U.S., even the world.

00:08:31.266 --> 00:08:33.809
We take only the most dangerous,
damaged patients,

00:08:33.894 --> 00:08:35.853
ones no other hospital can manage.

00:08:35.938 --> 00:08:37.855
And it's all due to Dr. Cawley.

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:39.857
He's created something
really unique here.

00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:43.528
It's a hospital for people our society
normally considers beyond treatment.

00:09:08.136 --> 00:09:10.096
Top of his class
at Johns Hopkins, then Harvard ...

00:09:11.515 --> 00:09:13.266
IDs, gentlemen.

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:18.896
Show your badges, gentlemen.

00:09:18.981 --> 00:09:22.942
Dr. Cawley's been consulted
numerous times by Scotland Yard,

00:09:23.026 --> 00:09:25.486
- MI5, the OSS ...
- Why?

00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.197
What do you mean?

00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:32.785
What do intelligence agencies
want to consult a psychiatrist about?

00:09:32.869 --> 00:09:35.162
I guess you'll have to ask him.

00:09:45.007 --> 00:09:47.049
- Marshal Daniels.
- Doctor.

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:49.093
Marshal Aule.

00:09:49.553 --> 00:09:52.263
Thank you, Deputy Warden.
That will be all.

00:09:52.347 --> 00:09:55.016
Yes, sir. Pleasure, gentlemen.

00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:58.352
He had a lot to say about you.

00:09:58.437 --> 00:10:01.647
McPherson's a good man.
He believes in the work we do here.

00:10:01.732 --> 00:10:04.025
And what would that be, exactly?

00:10:04.109 --> 00:10:07.778
A moral fusion between law and order
and clinical care.

00:10:07.863 --> 00:10:10.865
Pardon me, Doc.
A what between what and what?

00:10:17.831 --> 00:10:20.875
Those paintings are quite accurate.

00:10:20.959 --> 00:10:22.835
Used to be the kind of patients
we deal with here ...

00:10:22.919 --> 00:10:26.130
were shackled and left
in their own filth.

00:10:26.214 --> 00:10:27.506
They were beaten,

00:10:27.591 --> 00:10:29.842
as if whipping them bloody
would drive the psychosis out.

00:10:29.926 --> 00:10:32.011
We drove screws into their brains,

00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:35.931
we submerged them in icy water
until they lost consciousness ...

00:10:36.767 --> 00:10:38.476
or even drowned.

00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:40.519
- And now?
- We treat them.

00:10:40.604 --> 00:10:42.813
Try to heal, try to cure.

00:10:42.898 --> 00:10:44.523
And if that fails,
at least we provide them ...

00:10:44.608 --> 00:10:47.860
with a measure of comfort
in their lives. Calm.

00:10:47.944 --> 00:10:51.197
These are all violent offenders, right?

00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:53.532
I mean, they've hurt people.

00:10:54.326 --> 00:10:58.037
- Murdered them in some cases.
- In almost all cases, yes.

00:10:58.121 --> 00:10:59.955
Then, personally, Doctor,
I'd have to say,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:02.416
screw their sense of calm.

00:11:04.002 --> 00:11:07.755
It's my job to treat my patients, not
their victims. I'm not here to judge.

00:11:07.839 --> 00:11:10.466
- So this female prisoner ...
- Patient.

00:11:11.301 --> 00:11:13.219
Excuse me. Patient,

00:11:13.303 --> 00:11:18.391
one Rachel Solando,
escaped sometime in the last 24 hours.

00:11:18.475 --> 00:11:22.395
- Last night between 10:00 and midnight.
- Is she considered dangerous?

00:11:22.479 --> 00:11:26.107
You could say that.
She killed all three of her children.

00:11:27.025 --> 00:11:29.902
She drowned them in the lake
behind her house.

00:11:29.986 --> 00:11:33.280
She took them out one by one,
held their heads under till they died,

00:11:33.365 --> 00:11:36.242
then she brought them back inside and
arranged them around the kitchen table.

00:11:36.326 --> 00:11:39.662
She ate a meal there
before a neighbor dropped by.

00:11:41.623 --> 00:11:42.748
And what about the husband?

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:46.544
He died on the beaches of Normandy.
She's a war widow.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:49.588
She starved herself
when she first came here.

00:11:49.673 --> 00:11:52.508
She insisted the children weren't dead.

00:12:02.352 --> 00:12:05.104
Sorry, Doctor. You don't happen
to have an aspirin, do you?

00:12:05.188 --> 00:12:07.940
- Prone to headaches, Marshal?
- Sometimes. But today,

00:12:08.024 --> 00:12:11.986
- I'm a little more prone to seasickness.
- Ah, dehydration.

00:12:12.237 --> 00:12:13.863
- You all right, boss?
- Yeah.

00:12:13.947 --> 00:12:16.657
In that case, you're quite right.
The simpler the better.

00:12:16.742 --> 00:12:18.284
Thanks so much.

00:12:19.161 --> 00:12:22.163
Rachel still believes
the children are alive.

00:12:22.706 --> 00:12:25.708
She also believes this place
is her home in the Berkshires.

00:12:27.753 --> 00:12:30.087
- You're kidding me.
- She's never once in two years ...

00:12:30.172 --> 00:12:31.839
acknowledged that she's
in an institution.

00:12:31.923 --> 00:12:35.801
She believes we're all deliverymen,
milkmen, postal workers.

00:12:35.886 --> 00:12:38.095
To sustain the delusion
that her children never died,

00:12:38.180 --> 00:12:40.181
she's created
an elaborate fictional structure,

00:12:40.265 --> 00:12:43.642
and she gives us all
parts to play in that fiction.

00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:46.645
So have you searched the grounds yet?

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:49.315
The warden and his men
scoured the island.

00:12:49.399 --> 00:12:50.900
Not a trace.

00:12:51.485 --> 00:12:56.030
And what's more disturbing is we don't
know how she got out of her room.

00:12:56.114 --> 00:12:59.909
It was locked from the outside,
and the only window is barred.

00:13:02.746 --> 00:13:06.207
It's as if she evaporated
straight through the walls.

00:13:12.088 --> 00:13:15.925
I brought her right back here
after group therapy, locked her in,

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:19.011
came back for midnight rounds,
she was gone.

00:13:25.811 --> 00:13:30.022
Seriously, Doctor, how is it possible
that the truth never gets through to her?

00:13:30.106 --> 00:13:33.025
I mean,
she's in a mental institution, right?

00:13:33.109 --> 00:13:35.110
Seems like something you'd notice
from time to time.

00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:37.363
How many pairs of shoes
are the patients given?

00:13:37.447 --> 00:13:38.823
Two pairs.

00:13:38.907 --> 00:13:43.160
Sanity's not a choice, Marshal.
You can't just choose to get over it.

00:13:43.745 --> 00:13:47.122
So, she left here barefoot?

00:13:47.791 --> 00:13:50.543
Come on, Doc, she couldn't
get 10 yards in that terrain.

00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:53.212
Marshal?

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:14.233
This is definitely
Rachel's handwriting.

00:14:14.317 --> 00:14:17.152
I have no idea
what the law of four is, though.

00:14:17.237 --> 00:14:20.072
- It's not a psychiatric term?
- I'm afraid not.

00:14:20.156 --> 00:14:21.657
"Who is 67?"

00:14:22.909 --> 00:14:23.993
Fuck if I know.

00:14:24.077 --> 00:14:27.121
I have to say that's quite close
to my clinical conclusion.

00:14:27.998 --> 00:14:29.915
Think it's just random scribblings?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.752
Oh, no, not at all. Rachel's smart.
Brilliant, in fact.

00:14:33.837 --> 00:14:35.254
This paper could be important.

00:14:35.338 --> 00:14:38.215
Excuse me, Doctor,
but we're gonna have to hold on to this.

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.675
Of course.

00:14:41.595 --> 00:14:44.471
And you say
she had to come through here?

00:14:44.556 --> 00:14:48.809
After lights out,
the orderlies play cards in here.

00:14:48.894 --> 00:14:52.229
Last night, there were seven men
sitting at the base of those stairs ...

00:14:52.314 --> 00:14:53.772
playing stud poker.

00:14:53.857 --> 00:14:56.901
Yet somehow,
Rachel managed to slip past them.

00:14:57.611 --> 00:14:58.611
Why?

00:14:58.695 --> 00:15:01.322
How? She turns invisible?

00:15:02.198 --> 00:15:04.283
Doctor, we're gonna need access
to the personnel files ...

00:15:04.367 --> 00:15:05.409
of all the medical staff.

00:15:05.493 --> 00:15:08.287
The nurses, the guards, the orderlies,
anyone who was working then.

00:15:08.371 --> 00:15:10.497
We'll take your request
under consideration.

00:15:10.582 --> 00:15:13.876
This is not a request, Doctor.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.462
This is a federal facility,
and a dangerous prisoner ...

00:15:16.546 --> 00:15:18.756
- Patient.
patient ...

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.133
has escaped. Now, you will comply or ...

00:15:21.217 --> 00:15:23.552
All I can say is
I'll see what I can do.

00:15:23.637 --> 00:15:28.599
Doctor, we're gonna need to speak
with the staff. Do you understand?

00:15:28.683 --> 00:15:30.893
I'll assemble them in the common room
after dinner.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.270
If you have any further questions,

00:15:33.355 --> 00:15:36.649
feel free to join the deputy warden
in the search.

00:15:49.079 --> 00:15:50.621
It's 11 miles
to the nearest land ...

00:15:50.705 --> 00:15:52.414
and the water's freezing.

00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:55.542
Current was strong last night,
tide pushing in.

00:15:55.627 --> 00:15:57.211
She'd have drowned
or been crushed on the rocks,

00:15:57.295 --> 00:16:00.464
and her body would have
washed back up on shore.

00:16:03.426 --> 00:16:06.679
What about those caves
down there? Have you checked them?

00:16:06.763 --> 00:16:09.139
No way she could get there.

00:16:09.224 --> 00:16:12.017
The bases of those cliffs
are covered in poison ivy,

00:16:12.102 --> 00:16:16.146
live oak, sumac, a thousand plants
with thorns as big as my dick.

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:20.109
You said yourself, Marshal,
she's got no shoes.

00:16:25.407 --> 00:16:28.117
All right, let's check the other side.

00:16:33.498 --> 00:16:36.458
- What's that tower?
- It's an old lighthouse.

00:16:37.127 --> 00:16:39.920
The guards already searched inside it.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:44.049
What's in there? More patients?

00:16:44.134 --> 00:16:46.260
Sewage treatment facility.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.639
It's getting dark soon.
I'm calling this off for tonight.

00:16:50.724 --> 00:16:52.266
Let's go, boys!

00:16:56.146 --> 00:16:58.063
You were on watch
on the landing, huh?

00:16:58.148 --> 00:17:01.567
Yeah. Couldn't nobody get in or out
of their room on that corridor ...

00:17:01.651 --> 00:17:03.402
without me seeing.

00:17:03.486 --> 00:17:08.198
Okay, Rachel Solando, who else does
she have to pass to get down here?

00:17:14.414 --> 00:17:17.082
Me. Glen Miga.

00:17:18.334 --> 00:17:19.918
Sir, I didn't see nothing.

00:17:20.336 --> 00:17:22.337
And you were at your post all night?

00:17:22.422 --> 00:17:24.757
Yeah, but I didn't see a thing.

00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:27.968
Glen.

00:17:29.637 --> 00:17:30.804
Glen.

00:17:33.641 --> 00:17:35.392
Tell me the truth.

00:17:36.519 --> 00:17:37.811
I ...

00:17:39.856 --> 00:17:42.107
I maybe went to the bathroom.

00:17:42.609 --> 00:17:45.277
What? You breached protocol.
Christ ...

00:17:45.361 --> 00:17:47.696
I wasn't gone more than a minute.

00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:50.783
All right, look. Let's back up here.
Let's all just back up.

00:17:50.867 --> 00:17:54.286
Miss Solando was put in her room
for lights out.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.790
Does anyone here know
what she did before that?

00:17:57.874 --> 00:17:59.583
Anyone?

00:18:00.085 --> 00:18:01.126
Come on, anyone, anyone,

00:18:01.211 --> 00:18:02.377
anyone, anyone.

00:18:03.088 --> 00:18:05.464
She was in a group therapy session.

00:18:05.548 --> 00:18:08.383
Huh. Anything unusual occur?

00:18:09.552 --> 00:18:11.261
Define "unusual."

00:18:11.763 --> 00:18:12.805
Excuse me?

00:18:12.889 --> 00:18:17.267
This is a mental institution, Marshal,
for the criminally insane.

00:18:17.352 --> 00:18:19.311
Usual isn't a big part of our day.

00:18:21.356 --> 00:18:22.981
I will rephrase.

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:26.985
Did anything happen last night
during group therapy that was more,

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:29.571
let's say, I don't know,
memorable than ...

00:18:29.656 --> 00:18:31.406
- Normal?
- Exactly.

00:18:32.158 --> 00:18:33.867
No. Sorry.

00:18:34.244 --> 00:18:37.538
Did Miss Solando say anything
during group therapy?

00:18:38.414 --> 00:18:40.707
She was worried about the rain.

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:43.043
And she hated the food here.

00:18:43.294 --> 00:18:45.254
Complained constantly,

00:18:45.338 --> 00:18:47.089
last night included.

00:18:48.466 --> 00:18:51.593
So you were there.
Was there a doctor present?

00:18:52.387 --> 00:18:55.013
Yes, Dr. Sheehan led the discussion.

00:18:56.015 --> 00:18:57.474
Dr. Sheehan?

00:18:58.184 --> 00:19:00.519
Yes, he was running the session.

00:19:01.938 --> 00:19:05.816
He's Rachel's primary, the psychiatrist
who directly oversees her care.

00:19:05.942 --> 00:19:06.942
Huh.

00:19:08.653 --> 00:19:10.863
We're gonna need
to speak with Dr. Sheehan.

00:19:10.947 --> 00:19:15.450
I'm afraid that won't be possible.
He left on the ferry this morning.

00:19:15.535 --> 00:19:18.871
His vacation was already planned.
He'd been putting it off too long.

00:19:18.955 --> 00:19:23.709
You're in a state of lockdown,
a dangerous patient has escaped,

00:19:23.793 --> 00:19:27.963
and you let her primary doctor
leave on vacation?

00:19:28.798 --> 00:19:30.299
Well, of course. He's a doctor.

00:19:35.138 --> 00:19:38.390
Do you have the phone number
for where he's gone?

00:19:38.892 --> 00:19:41.226
Hello? Hello?

00:19:42.979 --> 00:19:45.981
Hello? Anybody there?

00:19:47.275 --> 00:19:49.359
I'm sorry, sir, but it's all down.
All the lines.

00:19:49.444 --> 00:19:51.320
The storm's hitting the mainland
like a hammer.

00:19:51.404 --> 00:19:53.363
If you get it working,
come find me immediately.

00:19:53.448 --> 00:19:55.908
The marshals need to make
an important call.

00:19:55.992 --> 00:19:57.326
Yes, sir.

00:20:00.413 --> 00:20:03.373
Hello? Hello?

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:05.542
I'm afraid I have
evening rounds in the wards,

00:20:05.627 --> 00:20:09.379
but I'll be having drinks and a cigar
at my house around 9:00,

00:20:09.464 --> 00:20:11.465
if you'd care to drop by.

00:20:11.549 --> 00:20:13.842
Good. We can talk then, right?

00:20:16.012 --> 00:20:18.305
We have been talking, Marshal.

00:20:34.864 --> 00:20:38.075
Gotta say, I'm thinking I got
in the wrong line of public service.

00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:41.620
It is a little overwhelming.
It was constructed during the Civil War,

00:20:41.704 --> 00:20:44.957
the same time as the military fort
housing Ward C.

00:20:52.131 --> 00:20:54.299
This is the original
commander's quarters.

00:20:54.384 --> 00:20:57.970
When Uncle Sam got the bill,
the commander was court-martialed.

00:20:58.054 --> 00:21:00.097
I can see why.

00:21:00.181 --> 00:21:02.724
Nice music. Who is that? Brahms?

00:21:03.559 --> 00:21:04.685
No.

00:21:13.152 --> 00:21:16.238
- It's Mahler.
- Quite right, Marshal.

00:21:17.156 --> 00:21:20.951
Forgive me, gentlemen.
My colleague, Dr. Jeremiah Naehring.

00:21:29.711 --> 00:21:32.546
Quartet for Piano and Strings
in A minor.

00:21:36.092 --> 00:21:37.676
Your poison, gentlemen?

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.595
- Rye, if you got it.
- Soda and ice, please. Thanks.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:45.434
Oh? You don't indulge in alcohol?
I'm surprised.

00:21:47.103 --> 00:21:50.439
Isn't it common
for men in your profession to imbibe?

00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.775
Common enough. And yours?

00:21:55.445 --> 00:21:56.570
I'm sorry?

00:21:56.654 --> 00:21:59.531
- Your profession, Doctor. Psychiatry.
- Yes.

00:21:59.615 --> 00:22:01.950
I always heard it was overrun
with boozers and drunks.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.954
Not that I've noticed.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.874
What's that?
Iced tea in your glass, there?

00:22:10.168 --> 00:22:14.671
Excellent, Marshal. You have
outstanding defense mechanisms.

00:22:15.631 --> 00:22:19.551
You must be quite adept
at interrogations, hmm?

00:22:27.477 --> 00:22:31.021
Men like you are my specialty,
you know?

00:22:31.689 --> 00:22:33.398
Men of violence.

00:22:33.483 --> 00:22:35.359
Now that's a hell
of an assumption to make.

00:22:35.443 --> 00:22:38.111
No assumption. No, not at all.
You misunderstand me.

00:22:38.196 --> 00:22:41.198
I said you are men of violence.

00:22:41.282 --> 00:22:44.409
I'm not accusing you
of being violent men.

00:22:44.494 --> 00:22:45.494
That's quite different.

00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:48.413
No, please. Please.
Edify us, Doctor.

00:22:51.167 --> 00:22:53.085
You both served overseas, huh?

00:22:53.169 --> 00:22:54.419
It's not much of a stretch, Doc.

00:22:54.504 --> 00:22:58.006
For all you know, we were
both paper pushers over there.

00:22:58.091 --> 00:22:59.549
No, you were not.

00:23:15.650 --> 00:23:16.650
Since the schoolyard,

00:23:16.734 --> 00:23:20.779
neither of you has ever walked away
from a physical conflict.

00:23:20.863 --> 00:23:23.031
No, no, not because you enjoy it,

00:23:23.116 --> 00:23:26.993
but because retreat isn't something
you consider an option.

00:23:27.328 --> 00:23:28.912
We weren't raised to run, Doc.

00:23:28.996 --> 00:23:32.416
Ah! Yes. "Raised."

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.545
And who raised you, Marshal?

00:23:37.046 --> 00:23:38.213
Me?

00:23:39.465 --> 00:23:41.049
- Wolves.
- Ah!

00:23:44.429 --> 00:23:46.555
Very impressive defense mechanisms.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.741
Do you believe
in God, Marshal?

00:24:53.998 --> 00:24:55.874
No, I'm quite serious.

00:25:01.797 --> 00:25:04.466
You ever seen a death camp, Doctor?

00:25:09.805 --> 00:25:10.805
Huh?

00:25:19.857 --> 00:25:21.858
His English really is very good.

00:25:21.943 --> 00:25:24.778
You hit the consonants
a tad hard, though.

00:25:25.863 --> 00:25:27.531
You're a German?

00:25:28.407 --> 00:25:30.742
Is legal immigration a crime, Marshal?

00:25:30.826 --> 00:25:33.245
Oh, I don't know, Doctor. You tell us.

00:25:35.498 --> 00:25:38.750
Now, listen. We're gonna need
those files on Sheehan ...

00:25:38.834 --> 00:25:40.627
and the rest of the staff as well.

00:25:40.711 --> 00:25:43.838
No personnel files will
be released to you. Period.

00:25:43.923 --> 00:25:47.008
- We're gonna need those files.
- Out of the question.

00:25:47.093 --> 00:25:49.761
Bullshit, out of the question! Bullshit!

00:25:49.845 --> 00:25:52.639
Just who the hell's in charge here,
anyway, huh?

00:25:52.723 --> 00:25:56.268
Dr. Naehring acts as liaison
to our Board of Overseers.

00:25:56.352 --> 00:25:58.520
He relayed your request,
and it's been refused.

00:25:58.604 --> 00:26:01.940
Refused? They don't have the authority
to refuse, and neither do you, sir.

00:26:02.024 --> 00:26:05.735
Marshal, continue your investigation
and we'll do all we can to help.

00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:07.404
This investigation is over.

00:26:07.488 --> 00:26:09.781
We're gonna file our reports
and we're gonna hand it over to ...

00:26:09.865 --> 00:26:12.367
- Hoover's boys.
- Hoover's boys. That's right.

00:26:12.451 --> 00:26:16.204
We'll be taking the ferry back
in the morning. Come on, Chuck.

00:26:24.797 --> 00:26:26.214
Nice night.

00:26:32.179 --> 00:26:35.223
You'll be bunking
in the orderlies' quarters.

00:26:47.028 --> 00:26:51.072
Hey, boss. We really packing it in?

00:26:51.699 --> 00:26:52.866
Why?

00:26:53.409 --> 00:26:57.704
I guess ... I don't know, I just
never really quit anything before.

00:26:58.122 --> 00:27:00.957
We haven't heard the truth
once yet, Chuck.

00:27:01.667 --> 00:27:05.295
Listen, Rachel Solando didn't slip out
of a locked cell, barefoot,

00:27:05.379 --> 00:27:06.588
without any help.

00:27:07.757 --> 00:27:09.674
I think she had a lot of help.

00:27:10.384 --> 00:27:12.969
Maybe Cawley's sitting up
in his mansion right now ...

00:27:13.054 --> 00:27:15.347
rethinking his whole attitude.

00:27:16.432 --> 00:27:19.893
- Maybe, in the morning, we'll be ...
- You're bluffing?

00:27:20.394 --> 00:27:22.145
I didn't say that.

00:27:40.581 --> 00:27:43.208
I found a whole stack of these, Teddy.

00:27:43.918 --> 00:27:46.378
Jesus, are you ever sober anymore?

00:27:47.463 --> 00:27:50.131
I killed a lot of people in the war.

00:27:51.884 --> 00:27:53.760
Is that why you drink?

00:27:56.597 --> 00:27:58.098
Are you real?

00:27:59.266 --> 00:28:00.308
No.

00:28:04.313 --> 00:28:05.980
She's still here.

00:28:06.649 --> 00:28:07.982
Who?

00:28:09.068 --> 00:28:10.318
Rachel?

00:28:11.654 --> 00:28:13.196
She never left.

00:28:27.002 --> 00:28:30.714
Remember when we stayed in the cabin
in the summer, Teddy?

00:28:31.507 --> 00:28:33.216
We were so happy.

00:28:35.594 --> 00:28:37.053
She's here.

00:28:37.513 --> 00:28:39.097
You can't leave.

00:28:51.944 --> 00:28:53.778
I'm not gonna leave.

00:28:55.114 --> 00:28:57.031
I love you so much.

00:29:01.412 --> 00:29:03.955
I'm just bones in a box, Teddy.

00:29:04.039 --> 00:29:05.081
No.

00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:08.042
I am.

00:29:10.921 --> 00:29:12.839
You have to wake up.

00:29:14.717 --> 00:29:16.217
I won't go.

00:29:17.303 --> 00:29:18.803
You're here.

00:29:20.723 --> 00:29:24.601
I'm not. You have to face that.

00:29:27.813 --> 00:29:29.272
But she is.

00:29:31.484 --> 00:29:32.901
So is he.

00:29:34.987 --> 00:29:36.196
Who?

00:29:38.657 --> 00:29:40.033
Laeddis.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.664
- I have to go.
- No.

00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.419
No, please. Please.
I need to hold on to you.

00:29:52.087 --> 00:29:54.756
- Just a little bit longer, please.
- Oh, God, Teddy.

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.841
You have to let me go.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:29:59.636
I can't.

00:30:31.252 --> 00:30:33.419
Ain't gonna be no ferry in this shit.

00:30:38.634 --> 00:30:39.968
Doctor!

00:30:40.386 --> 00:30:42.178
Doctor, Doctor.

00:30:42.263 --> 00:30:45.265
We need to interview the patients who
were in Rachel's group therapy session.

00:30:45.349 --> 00:30:47.267
I thought your investigation
was finished.

00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:50.311
Well, it's not like
we could take the ferry.

00:30:50.396 --> 00:30:53.356
Now, was Rachel receiving any
other treatments for her illnesses?

00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:58.570
Do you know the state of the mental
health field these days, gentlemen?

00:30:58.654 --> 00:31:00.822
No, not a clue, Doctor.

00:31:00.906 --> 00:31:02.240
War.

00:31:02.324 --> 00:31:05.076
The old school believes
in surgical intervention.

00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.661
Psychosurgery.

00:31:06.745 --> 00:31:09.706
Procedures like
the transorbital lobotomy.

00:31:10.833 --> 00:31:14.127
Some say the patients
become reasonable, docile.

00:31:14.211 --> 00:31:16.504
Others say they become zombies.

00:31:16.589 --> 00:31:18.756
- And the new school?
- Psychopharmacology.

00:31:18.841 --> 00:31:21.092
A new drug has just been approved
called Thorazine,

00:31:21.176 --> 00:31:24.345
which relaxes psychotic patients,
you could say tames them.

00:31:24.430 --> 00:31:25.763
And which school are you, Doctor?

00:31:25.848 --> 00:31:30.393
Me? I have this radical idea that
if you treat a patient with respect,

00:31:30.477 --> 00:31:34.606
listen to him, try and understand,
you just might reach him.

00:31:37.526 --> 00:31:39.903
Come on, Marge. It's okay.

00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.489
- These patients, huh?
- Even these.

00:31:43.574 --> 00:31:45.992
What should be a last resort
is becoming a first response.

00:31:46.076 --> 00:31:49.954
Give them a pill, put them in
a corner, it all goes away.

00:31:50.039 --> 00:31:52.290
Rachel Solando was
on a combination of drugs ...

00:31:52.374 --> 00:31:54.292
meant to keep her
from becoming violent,

00:31:54.376 --> 00:31:57.462
but it was only
intermittently effective.

00:31:57.546 --> 00:31:59.172
The greatest obstacle
to her recovery ...

00:31:59.256 --> 00:32:02.216
was her refusal
to face what she had done.

00:32:03.010 --> 00:32:04.218
"Was."

00:32:04.762 --> 00:32:09.641
Is there a reason you keep referring
to your patient in the past tense, Doctor?

00:32:12.269 --> 00:32:15.772
Look outside, Marshal.
Why do you think?

00:32:22.738 --> 00:32:24.322
Next up is Peter Breene.

00:32:24.406 --> 00:32:26.741
Assaulted his father's nurse
with broken glass.

00:32:26.825 --> 00:32:30.370
Nurse survived, but her face
is permanently disfigured.

00:32:30.454 --> 00:32:31.913
I can't wait.

00:32:31.997 --> 00:32:38.169
She'd smile at me. She was so sweet,
but you could see it in her eyes.

00:32:38.253 --> 00:32:41.631
She liked to be naked, to suck cock.

00:32:43.050 --> 00:32:44.759
Okay, Mr. Breene.

00:32:45.511 --> 00:32:48.805
And then she asked me
if she can have a glass of water?

00:32:48.889 --> 00:32:52.058
Alone, in the kitchen,
like that's no big deal?

00:32:53.018 --> 00:32:56.104
- Well, why was that a big deal?
- It was obvious.

00:32:56.188 --> 00:33:00.400
She wanted me to pull out my thing
so that she could laugh at it.

00:33:02.486 --> 00:33:03.945
Mr. Breene.

00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:08.116
We need to ask you
some questions, okay?

00:33:10.285 --> 00:33:12.537
When I cut her, she screamed.

00:33:14.456 --> 00:33:17.166
But  ... she scared me.

00:33:18.293 --> 00:33:21.462
- What did she expect?
- Interesting.

00:33:22.464 --> 00:33:26.092
But we're here
to talk about Rachel Solando, okay?

00:33:26.176 --> 00:33:28.219
Rachel Solando. Do you ...

00:33:28.303 --> 00:33:30.555
Do you know that
she drowned her own kids?

00:33:30.639 --> 00:33:32.765
She drowned her kids!

00:33:32.850 --> 00:33:35.893
This is ... This is a sick fucking world
we live in, I'll tell you that.

00:33:35.978 --> 00:33:37.729
But you know what?
They should be gassed.

00:33:37.813 --> 00:33:42.066
All of them.
The retards, the killers, the niggers.

00:33:42.151 --> 00:33:44.777
You kill your own kid, gas the bitch.

00:33:48.157 --> 00:33:49.991
Could you stop that?

00:33:51.535 --> 00:33:53.911
- That nurse ...
- Please, stop that.

00:33:53.996 --> 00:33:57.081
That nurse,
maybe she had kids, huh?

00:33:59.001 --> 00:34:00.418
A husband.

00:34:01.545 --> 00:34:03.880
Just trying to make ends meet,

00:34:05.257 --> 00:34:07.550
lead a normal life.

00:34:08.552 --> 00:34:10.803
It says in your file that ...

00:34:11.764 --> 00:34:14.348
you tore her face off. Didn't you?

00:34:15.851 --> 00:34:16.809
Congratulations.

00:34:16.894 --> 00:34:19.812
No more normal for her,
not ever again. No.

00:34:21.648 --> 00:34:24.275
Do you know what she was afraid of?

00:34:27.071 --> 00:34:28.112
You.

00:34:28.197 --> 00:34:30.448
Could you stop that? Please?

00:34:32.451 --> 00:34:33.826
Stop that!

00:34:34.703 --> 00:34:36.120
Please! Stop!

00:34:36.205 --> 00:34:38.372
Do you know a patient
named Andrew Laeddis? Do you?

00:34:38.457 --> 00:34:39.665
No! No.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.793
- Boss. What's up?
- Fine.

00:34:41.877 --> 00:34:43.878
- I wanna go back. I wanna go.
- Peter!

00:34:43.962 --> 00:34:47.590
Come on! I got him. Peter! Peter!
Hey, Peter!

00:34:47.674 --> 00:34:50.468
- Go back. I wanna go back.
- Come on, Peter.

00:34:50.552 --> 00:34:51.677
- I don't wanna see him.
- Easy now.

00:34:51.762 --> 00:34:54.555
- I don't wanna see him anymore.
- It's okay. It's all right.

00:35:00.687 --> 00:35:04.398
Oh, I'll never get out of here.
I'm not sure that I should.

00:35:06.235 --> 00:35:08.736
Excuse me for saying this,
Miss Kearns ...

00:35:08.821 --> 00:35:11.572
- Mrs.
- Mrs. Kearns.

00:35:13.242 --> 00:35:16.160
But you seem quite normal.

00:35:16.245 --> 00:35:19.455
I mean, in comparison
to the other patients here.

00:35:19.540 --> 00:35:23.167
Well, I have my dark days.
I suppose everybody does.

00:35:24.253 --> 00:35:27.964
The difference is most people
don't kill their husbands with an ax.

00:35:28.757 --> 00:35:29.799
Ah.

00:35:29.967 --> 00:35:32.677
Although, personally,
I think if a man beats you ...

00:35:32.761 --> 00:35:37.598
and fucks half the women he sees,
and no one will help you,

00:35:38.308 --> 00:35:42.103
axing him isn't the least
understandable thing you could do.

00:35:43.438 --> 00:35:44.856
Maybe you shouldn't get out.

00:35:46.650 --> 00:35:51.028
What would I do if I did?
I don't know the world anymore.

00:35:51.113 --> 00:35:55.825
They say there are bombs
that can reduce whole cities to ash.

00:35:55.909 --> 00:36:01.247
And what do you call them, televisions,
voices and faces coming from a box.

00:36:01.415 --> 00:36:03.916
I hear enough voices already.

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:07.628
What can you tell us about Rachel?

00:36:09.214 --> 00:36:10.339
Um ...

00:36:10.507 --> 00:36:13.718
Not much. She keeps to herself.

00:36:13.802 --> 00:36:17.221
She believed her kids were alive.

00:36:18.015 --> 00:36:20.349
She thought she was still living
in the Berkshires,

00:36:20.434 --> 00:36:25.396
and we were all her neighbors,
the milkmen, postmen ...

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.023
Deliverymen.

00:36:28.025 --> 00:36:30.651
And Dr. Sheehan was there that night?

00:36:30.736 --> 00:36:34.322
Yes. He talked about anger.

00:36:37.159 --> 00:36:40.286
Tell me about him. What's he like?

00:36:42.414 --> 00:36:43.789
Uh, he's, uh ...

00:36:46.501 --> 00:36:48.169
Okay. Nice.

00:36:49.504 --> 00:36:51.964
Not hard on the eyes,
as my mother would say.

00:36:54.885 --> 00:36:58.221
- Did he ever make a pass at you?
- No.

00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:02.683
No, Dr. Sheehan's a good doctor,
he would never ...

00:37:04.144 --> 00:37:05.394
Um ...

00:37:06.063 --> 00:37:08.356
Could I have
a glass of water, please?

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:09.857
No problem.

00:37:24.706 --> 00:37:27.041
- Thank you, Marshal.
- Sure.

00:37:30.754 --> 00:37:34.131
I just have one more question
for you, Mrs. Kearns.

00:37:37.386 --> 00:37:40.680
Did you ever meet a patient
named Andrew Laeddis?

00:37:43.767 --> 00:37:44.934
No.

00:37:46.311 --> 00:37:47.979
Never heard of him.

00:37:53.902 --> 00:37:55.069
She was coached.

00:37:55.654 --> 00:37:58.239
She used practically the same words
as Cawley and the nurse,

00:37:58.323 --> 00:38:01.742
like she'd been told exactly what to say.
- Who's Andrew Laeddis?

00:38:06.331 --> 00:38:10.668
You asked every one of those patients
back there about him. Who is he?

00:38:14.506 --> 00:38:17.967
What the hell, boss?
I'm your partner, for Christ's sake.

00:38:18.051 --> 00:38:19.927
We just met, Chuck.

00:38:20.345 --> 00:38:23.931
You've been on the beat for a long time.
You've got a duty. You've got a career.

00:38:24.016 --> 00:38:28.436
What I'm doing,
it's not exactly by the book.

00:38:29.855 --> 00:38:32.648
I don't give a damn
about by-the-book, boss.

00:38:32.733 --> 00:38:35.609
I just wanna know
what the hell's going on.

00:38:39.865 --> 00:38:42.491
When this case came over the wires,

00:38:43.368 --> 00:38:46.370
I requested it specifically,
you understand?

00:38:46.788 --> 00:38:47.997
Why?

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:51.959
Andrew Laeddis,

00:38:52.794 --> 00:38:54.962
he was the maintenance man
in the apartment building ...

00:38:55.047 --> 00:38:57.214
where my wife and I lived.

00:38:58.258 --> 00:38:59.508
Okay.

00:39:01.345 --> 00:39:03.387
He was also a firebug.

00:39:06.183 --> 00:39:08.809
Andrew Laeddis lit the match ...

00:39:11.563 --> 00:39:14.482
that caused the fire
that killed my wife.

00:39:22.699 --> 00:39:24.158
Let them out!

00:39:26.828 --> 00:39:30.164
- What happened to Laeddis?
- He got away with it.

00:39:30.248 --> 00:39:32.666
Laeddis got away with it
and then he disappeared.

00:39:32.751 --> 00:39:35.753
About a year ago, I open up
the paper and there he is.

00:39:35.837 --> 00:39:40.341
Ugly-looking son of a bitch. Huge scar
from his right temple down to his left lip.

00:39:40.425 --> 00:39:43.886
Eyes different colors.
Not the type of face you'd forget.

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:47.098
He burned down a schoolhouse,
killed two people,

00:39:47.182 --> 00:39:48.933
said voices told him to do it.

00:39:49.017 --> 00:39:51.644
First he went to prison,
then he got transferred here.

00:39:51.728 --> 00:39:53.938
- Then what?
- Then nothing.

00:39:54.022 --> 00:39:57.775
He vanished like he never existed.
No record whatsoever.

00:39:57.859 --> 00:40:00.236
Pretty sure he's not in Ward B.
That leaves Ward C.

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.612
Or he could be dead.

00:40:01.696 --> 00:40:04.281
So could Rachel Solando,
for that matter.

00:40:04.366 --> 00:40:06.951
Lot of places to hide a body here.

00:40:07.744 --> 00:40:10.663
Only one place
no one would really notice.

00:40:22.217 --> 00:40:26.303
That patient, Bridget Kearns,
when she sent me for water,

00:40:26.388 --> 00:40:29.306
she said something to you back there,
didn't she?

00:40:29.391 --> 00:40:30.516
No.

00:40:32.436 --> 00:40:33.727
Come on, boss.

00:40:37.607 --> 00:40:39.150
She wrote it.

00:40:54.583 --> 00:40:59.670
Boss! We gotta get indoors. It's turning
into a fucking Kansas out here.

00:40:59.754 --> 00:41:02.006
- Hold on.
- No, let's go!

00:41:04.885 --> 00:41:06.343
Watch out!

00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:09.680
Jesus!

00:41:11.433 --> 00:41:13.726
- Come on! Up there!
- Let's go!

00:41:16.396 --> 00:41:18.355
Get in there! Let's go!

00:41:21.985 --> 00:41:23.194
Boss!

00:41:30.285 --> 00:41:32.328
- God!
- Jesus Christ!

00:41:33.663 --> 00:41:35.623
Damn it. God!

00:41:44.299 --> 00:41:47.593
- You okay, boss?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

00:41:54.601 --> 00:41:56.685
So if Laeddis is here,

00:41:57.771 --> 00:42:00.147
what are you gonna do about it?
- Mmm.

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:04.193
I'm not here to kill Laeddis.

00:42:11.868 --> 00:42:14.703
If it was my wife,
I'd kill him. Twice.

00:42:25.465 --> 00:42:30.094
When we got through the gates
at Dachau, the SS guards surrendered.

00:42:38.687 --> 00:42:44.358
The Kommandant tried to kill himself
before we got there, but he ...

00:42:45.527 --> 00:42:46.819
He botched it.

00:42:48.363 --> 00:42:50.364
Took him an hour to die.

00:42:55.537 --> 00:42:59.206
When I went outside,
I saw all the bodies on the ground.

00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:05.379
Too many to count.

00:43:32.073 --> 00:43:33.907
Too many to imagine.

00:43:36.536 --> 00:43:38.245
So, yeah, the ...

00:43:40.415 --> 00:43:42.333
The guards surrendered,
we took their guns,

00:43:42.417 --> 00:43:44.335
and we lined them up.

00:44:28.546 --> 00:44:30.673
It wasn't warfare. It was ...

00:44:32.717 --> 00:44:34.218
It was murder.

00:44:37.722 --> 00:44:40.641
Yeah, I've had enough of killing.

00:44:43.144 --> 00:44:45.145
That's not why I'm here.

00:44:46.189 --> 00:44:49.024
So what is this all about?

00:44:50.276 --> 00:44:56.156
After Laeddis vanished, I started doing
some checking on Ashecliffe.

00:44:57.659 --> 00:45:00.744
A lot of people know about this place,
but no one wants to talk.

00:45:00.829 --> 00:45:02.329
You know, it's like it ...

00:45:02.831 --> 00:45:04.873
It's like they're scared or something.

00:45:06.835 --> 00:45:09.920
You know, this place is funded
by a special grant ...

00:45:10.839 --> 00:45:13.674
from The House
Un-American Activities Committee?

00:45:13.758 --> 00:45:16.927
HUAC? And how exactly
are we fighting the communists ...

00:45:17.011 --> 00:45:19.346
from an island in Boston Harbor?

00:45:19.973 --> 00:45:22.599
By conducting experiments on the mind.

00:45:24.018 --> 00:45:25.477
At least that's my guess.

00:45:25.562 --> 00:45:27.271
And you think that's going on here?

00:45:27.355 --> 00:45:29.857
Like I said, no one would talk, right?

00:45:29.941 --> 00:45:32.609
Till I found somebody
who used to be a patient here.

00:45:32.694 --> 00:45:37.072
Guy's name is George Noyce.
Nice college kid. Socialist.

00:45:37.157 --> 00:45:39.199
He gets offered some money
to do a psych study.

00:45:39.284 --> 00:45:40.659
Guess what they were testing?

00:45:40.744 --> 00:45:41.827
Toothpaste.

00:45:41.911 --> 00:45:44.288
So, he starts
seeing dragons everywhere.

00:45:44.372 --> 00:45:49.376
He almost beats his professor to death.
Ends up here in Ashecliffe, Ward C.

00:45:50.044 --> 00:45:53.505
They release him after one year, right?
And what does he do?

00:45:53.590 --> 00:45:58.510
Two weeks on the mainland, he walks
into a bar, stabs three men to death.

00:45:59.304 --> 00:46:04.016
His lawyer pleads insanity, but Noyce,
he stands up in the courtroom and he ...

00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.562
He begs the judge for the electric chair.
Anywhere but a mental hospital.

00:46:09.189 --> 00:46:11.774
Judge gives him life in Dedham Prison.

00:46:12.817 --> 00:46:15.611
- And you found him.
- Yeah, I found him.

00:46:15.695 --> 00:46:18.197
Well, he's a mess.

00:46:19.783 --> 00:46:21.909
But it's pretty clear
from what he tells me.

00:46:21.993 --> 00:46:23.118
What?

00:46:23.203 --> 00:46:25.245
They're experimenting on people here.

00:46:26.039 --> 00:46:27.748
I don't know, boss.

00:46:29.042 --> 00:46:32.294
- How do you believe a crazy guy?
- That's the beauty of it, isn't it?

00:46:32.378 --> 00:46:36.632
Crazy people, they're the perfect
subjects. They talk, nobody listens.

00:46:37.217 --> 00:46:38.884
I stood at Dachau.

00:46:39.135 --> 00:46:43.806
We saw what human beings are capable
of doing to each other, right?

00:46:43.890 --> 00:46:46.475
For Christ's sakes, we fought
a goddamn war to stop them,

00:46:46.559 --> 00:46:51.438
and now ... Now I find out it may be
happening here? On our soil? No.

00:46:52.607 --> 00:46:55.234
So what are you
really here to do, Ted?

00:46:55.944 --> 00:46:59.738
I'm gonna get the proof,
I'm gonna go back,

00:46:59.823 --> 00:47:02.074
and I'm gonna blow
the lid off this place.

00:47:02.784 --> 00:47:04.117
That's it.

00:47:04.911 --> 00:47:06.411
Wait a minute.

00:47:06.996 --> 00:47:09.790
You started asking around
about Ashecliffe,

00:47:09.874 --> 00:47:11.291
waiting for a chance
to get out here,

00:47:11.376 --> 00:47:13.961
and then suddenly
they need a U.S. Marshal?

00:47:14.045 --> 00:47:17.923
Yeah, I got lucky. There was a patient
escape. It was the perfect excuse.

00:47:18.007 --> 00:47:21.009
No, no, no, boss.
Luck doesn't work that way.

00:47:21.094 --> 00:47:22.761
The world doesn't work that way.

00:47:22.846 --> 00:47:26.139
They got an electrified fence
around a septic facility.

00:47:26.224 --> 00:47:29.351
Ward C is inside a Civil War fort?

00:47:29.435 --> 00:47:33.105
A Chief of Staff with ties to the OSS?
Funding from HUAC?

00:47:33.189 --> 00:47:37.776
I mean, Jesus Christ, everything about
this place stinks of government ops.

00:47:37.861 --> 00:47:39.862
- What if they wanted you here?
- Bullshit.

00:47:39.946 --> 00:47:42.072
- You were asking questions.
- Bullshit! Bullshit!

00:47:42.156 --> 00:47:43.657
Bullshit. We came here
for Rachel Solando.

00:47:43.741 --> 00:47:46.618
Where's one shred of evidence
she even existed?

00:47:46.703 --> 00:47:47.870
There's no way
they could've known ...

00:47:47.954 --> 00:47:49.329
I'd be assigned to this case.
There's no way.

00:47:49.414 --> 00:47:52.749
What if while you were looking into
them, they were looking into you?

00:47:52.834 --> 00:47:56.044
All they had to do was fake an escape
to get you here, and now they have you.

00:47:56.129 --> 00:47:57.921
Now they have us both. Here! Now!

00:48:02.176 --> 00:48:04.511
Marshals, are you out here?

00:48:04.596 --> 00:48:06.930
This is Deputy Warden McPherson.

00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:08.682
Marshals!

00:48:08.766 --> 00:48:10.767
How about that? They found us, huh?

00:48:10.852 --> 00:48:13.353
It's an island, boss.
They're always gonna find us.

00:48:14.731 --> 00:48:16.356
I know you're in there.

00:48:17.942 --> 00:48:21.111
We're getting off this goddamn island.
You and me. Come on.

00:48:25.825 --> 00:48:27.534
- Come on!
- Go, go!

00:48:37.337 --> 00:48:40.464
Get dried off.
Dr. Cawley wants to talk to you now.

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:44.635
And hurry up! This thing is turning
into a goddamn hurricane!

00:48:49.807 --> 00:48:54.144
I dropped those suits off to be cleaned.
Should be ready by tomorrow.

00:48:54.228 --> 00:48:57.022
That is, if we all don't
wash away first.

00:48:57.106 --> 00:49:01.568
You know, speaking of which, I'm afraid
your smokes are pretty much done for.

00:49:02.153 --> 00:49:03.320
So ...

00:49:04.989 --> 00:49:07.115
This is our only choice, huh?

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.243
Got something really nice in a
prison gray if that don't work for you.

00:49:10.328 --> 00:49:13.246
Now that you mention it,
these are just fine.

00:49:13.957 --> 00:49:17.042
That's why I must repeat my insistence
that all Ward C patients ...

00:49:17.126 --> 00:49:19.378
be placed in manual restraints.

00:49:19.462 --> 00:49:22.798
If the facility floods,
they'll drown. You know that.

00:49:23.257 --> 00:49:24.508
That would take
a lot of flooding.

00:49:24.592 --> 00:49:25.550
We're on an island ...

00:49:25.635 --> 00:49:27.260
in the middle of the ocean
during a hurricane.

00:49:27.345 --> 00:49:30.013
A lot of flooding seems
like a distinct possibility.

00:49:30.098 --> 00:49:32.432
It's a gamble, Stephen.
Say the power fails.

00:49:32.517 --> 00:49:33.767
There's a backup generator.

00:49:33.851 --> 00:49:36.561
And if that goes,
the cell doors will open.

00:49:38.106 --> 00:49:40.357
Where are they going to go? Mmm?

00:49:40.441 --> 00:49:43.443
They can't just hop a ferry, scoot over
to the mainland and wreak havoc.

00:49:43.528 --> 00:49:44.528
Oh, you're quite right.

00:49:44.612 --> 00:49:47.781
They're far more likely
to wreak havoc right here on us.

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.618
If they're manacled to the floor,
they'll die.

00:49:51.953 --> 00:49:53.829
This is 24 human beings.

00:49:54.455 --> 00:49:55.789
And you can live with that, can you?

00:49:55.957 --> 00:49:59.960
Well, frankly, if it were up to me,
I'd put all 42 in Wards A and B ...

00:50:00.044 --> 00:50:01.378
in manual restraints as well.

00:50:01.462 --> 00:50:04.339
- Excuse me! Excuse me.
- Marshal.

00:50:04.424 --> 00:50:06.967
I'm sorry, Doctor.
I just have one quick question.

00:50:07.051 --> 00:50:08.260
Yes, I'll be with you in a moment.

00:50:08.344 --> 00:50:11.346
When we spoke this morning
about Rachel Solando's note ...

00:50:11.431 --> 00:50:13.140
"The law of four." I love that.

00:50:13.224 --> 00:50:16.768
...you said you had no idea what that
second line could refer to, correct?

00:50:17.937 --> 00:50:22.190
"Who is 67?" Yes, I'm afraid
I still don't. None of us do.

00:50:22.275 --> 00:50:24.943
Uh-huh. Nothing comes to mind?

00:50:27.655 --> 00:50:28.864
Nothing?

00:50:32.827 --> 00:50:37.873
Because I believe I just heard you say
there are 24 patients in Ward C ...

00:50:37.957 --> 00:50:40.417
and 42 patients in Wards A and B,

00:50:40.501 --> 00:50:43.962
which means there's a total of,
what, 66 patients at this facility?

00:50:45.631 --> 00:50:46.631
That is correct, yes.

00:50:50.094 --> 00:50:52.512
Well, it seems to me
Rachel Solando was suggesting ...

00:50:53.264 --> 00:50:56.391
that you have a 67th patient, Doctor.

00:50:57.977 --> 00:50:59.394
But I'm afraid we don't.

00:50:59.479 --> 00:51:01.938
This is ridiculous.
What are they doing here?

00:51:02.023 --> 00:51:04.191
We're doing our goddamn job.

00:51:04.525 --> 00:51:07.194
Didn't McPherson tell you
the good news?

00:51:07.737 --> 00:51:10.197
No.
What's the good news, Doctor?

00:51:10.865 --> 00:51:12.616
Rachel's been found.

00:51:13.659 --> 00:51:15.035
She's here.

00:51:16.204 --> 00:51:17.704
Safe and sound.

00:51:29.383 --> 00:51:31.426
There's not a mark on her.

00:51:35.056 --> 00:51:36.473
Who are these men?

00:51:39.852 --> 00:51:41.436
Why are they in my house?

00:51:41.521 --> 00:51:46.024
Police officers, Rachel.
They have a few questions.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:50.737
Ma'am.

00:51:54.117 --> 00:51:58.703
There has been a sighting of a known
communist subversive in this area,

00:51:58.788 --> 00:52:00.705
passing out literature.

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:03.708
Here?

00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.546
In this neighborhood?

00:52:07.630 --> 00:52:09.381
Yes, I'm afraid so.

00:52:10.758 --> 00:52:14.344
Now if you could tell us what
you did yesterday, where you were,

00:52:14.428 --> 00:52:16.555
it would really help us
narrow down our search.

00:52:18.224 --> 00:52:19.432
Yes, um ...

00:52:22.186 --> 00:52:23.520
Well, I, um ...

00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:29.276
I made breakfast
for Jim and the children,

00:52:30.945 --> 00:52:32.362
and then I ...

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.449
packed Jim's lunch and he left.

00:52:40.121 --> 00:52:42.789
Then I sent the children
off to school.

00:52:47.211 --> 00:52:48.461
And then ...

00:52:54.886 --> 00:52:57.929
I decided to take a long swim
in the lake.

00:53:04.812 --> 00:53:06.021
I see.

00:53:09.734 --> 00:53:11.276
And after that?

00:53:15.907 --> 00:53:17.532
Um ...

00:53:19.452 --> 00:53:20.785
After that,

00:53:30.588 --> 00:53:32.214
I thought of you.

00:53:38.221 --> 00:53:42.182
I'm sorry, ma'am, I don't know
what you're talking about.

00:53:45.186 --> 00:53:48.146
Don't you know
how lonely I've been, Jim?

00:53:54.111 --> 00:53:55.195
You're gone.

00:53:59.450 --> 00:54:00.909
You're dead.

00:54:05.957 --> 00:54:07.832
I cry every night.

00:54:13.839 --> 00:54:16.049
How am I supposed to survive?

00:54:17.551 --> 00:54:18.718
God.

00:54:29.105 --> 00:54:32.399
Rachel, it'll be all right.

00:54:35.653 --> 00:54:37.696
I'm so sorry, but every ...

00:54:39.407 --> 00:54:42.242
Everything's gonna
be all right. Okay?

00:54:44.161 --> 00:54:45.620
I buried you.

00:54:47.957 --> 00:54:50.583
I buried an empty casket.
Your body rained down,

00:54:50.668 --> 00:54:54.170
lumps of flesh splashing into
the sea, eaten by sharks.

00:54:58.426 --> 00:55:01.052
My Jim's dead,
so who the fuck are you?

00:55:04.473 --> 00:55:06.141
Who the fuck are you?

00:55:06.892 --> 00:55:08.018
- Who are you?
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

00:55:08.102 --> 00:55:09.686
- Who are you?
- It's okay. Rachel. Rachel, it's all right.

00:55:09.770 --> 00:55:12.272
Let me go! No!

00:55:13.941 --> 00:55:16.067
- Rachel, it's okay.
- Look at me, look at me.

00:55:19.363 --> 00:55:22.282
I'm sorry about that.
I didn't want to interrupt.

00:55:22.366 --> 00:55:24.701
I thought she might
tell you something.

00:55:24.785 --> 00:55:28.705
We found her down by the
lighthouse, skipping stones.

00:55:28.789 --> 00:55:30.957
We've no idea how she got out, but ...

00:55:31.042 --> 00:55:33.418
I'm gonna have to ask you
to go down into the basement.

00:55:33.502 --> 00:55:35.462
There's food, water and cots.

00:55:35.546 --> 00:55:38.798
It's the safest place to be
when the hurricane hits.

00:55:43.095 --> 00:55:45.305
Are you all right? You look pale.

00:55:45.389 --> 00:55:47.182
I'm fine. It's just ...

00:55:48.642 --> 00:55:50.226
Boss, are you okay?

00:55:51.228 --> 00:55:53.813
It's just so goddamn bright, isn't it?

00:55:53.898 --> 00:55:58.234
Photosensitivity, headaches sometimes.
Marshal, are you having a migraine?

00:55:58.319 --> 00:55:59.986
I'll be all right.

00:56:02.073 --> 00:56:04.324
Come on, I got you.

00:56:06.118 --> 00:56:07.744
What's wrong with him?

00:56:07.828 --> 00:56:10.246
Take these, Marshal. Couple of hours,
you'll be as clear as a bell.

00:56:10.331 --> 00:56:12.332
- What's wrong with him?
- He's having a migraine.

00:56:12.416 --> 00:56:14.709
Imagine someone sawed open
your head, filled it with razors,

00:56:14.794 --> 00:56:17.504
and shook it as hard as they could.
Take the pills, Marshal.

00:56:17.588 --> 00:56:19.714
- I don't ... I don't want the pills.
- It'll stop the pain.

00:56:19.799 --> 00:56:21.716
Marshal, take the pills.

00:56:25.679 --> 00:56:27.680
He's going to need to lie down.

00:56:33.354 --> 00:56:34.312
Oh, my God!

00:56:34.397 --> 00:56:35.730
There's broken glass
all over the floor.

00:56:35.815 --> 00:56:37.315
- Make sure all the meds are locked up.
- Watch your back.

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.483
Make sure everything's okay in Ward B.

00:56:38.567 --> 00:56:39.859
Go down to the infirmary and see ...

00:56:39.944 --> 00:56:41.277
if there's any more ...
- All right, Doctor.

00:56:41.362 --> 00:56:45.156
Give him a bed. This one here.

00:56:45.241 --> 00:56:48.827
- Over here. All right, boss.
- Yeah, that's it.

00:56:48.911 --> 00:56:49.994
- You have him?
- Yes.

00:56:50.079 --> 00:56:52.163
Careful. All right.

00:56:53.249 --> 00:56:55.875
Could be worse right now.
He'll be all right.

00:57:02.216 --> 00:57:03.633
Who is that?

00:57:03.717 --> 00:57:06.219
Him? That's the warden.

00:57:08.889 --> 00:57:13.184
Don't you worry about him, all right?
Come on. Lay back. Lay back.

00:57:17.273 --> 00:57:20.692
He looks like
an ex-military prick, huh?

00:57:20.776 --> 00:57:22.735
Well, you know what? I ain't
gonna argue with you on that one.

00:58:49.073 --> 00:58:51.491
You should have saved me.

00:58:53.410 --> 00:58:55.787
You should have saved all of us.

00:59:22.856 --> 00:59:26.776
Hey, buddy.

00:59:28.821 --> 00:59:30.071
Hey.

00:59:30.155 --> 00:59:31.447
Laeddis.

00:59:33.075 --> 00:59:34.242
Yeah.

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.623
My ...

00:59:45.129 --> 00:59:46.212
My buddy.

00:59:47.673 --> 00:59:49.674
No hard feelings, right?

00:59:53.596 --> 00:59:54.679
Yeah.

00:59:56.223 --> 00:59:57.890
No hard feelings.

01:00:11.322 --> 01:00:13.531
A little something for later,

01:00:17.036 --> 01:00:19.621
'cause I know how much you need it.

01:00:25.836 --> 01:00:29.881
The clock's ticking, my friend.
We're running out of time.

01:00:40.726 --> 01:00:42.477
Give me a hand here.

01:01:04.750 --> 01:01:06.250
I could get into trouble.

01:01:34.655 --> 01:01:35.988
I'm dead.

01:01:38.951 --> 01:01:40.493
I'm so sorry.

01:01:42.162 --> 01:01:44.163
Why didn't you save me?

01:01:45.165 --> 01:01:50.795
I tried. I wanted to, but by the time
I got there, it was too late.

01:02:12.901 --> 01:02:14.026
See?

01:02:17.364 --> 01:02:19.198
Aren't they beautiful?

01:03:13.962 --> 01:03:16.047
Why are you all wet, baby?

01:03:18.759 --> 01:03:20.426
Laeddis isn't dead.

01:03:21.804 --> 01:03:23.304
He isn't gone.

01:03:24.515 --> 01:03:26.098
He's still here.

01:03:28.393 --> 01:03:29.602
I know.

01:03:30.562 --> 01:03:32.063
You need to find him, Teddy.

01:03:32.564 --> 01:03:34.774
You need to find him
and you kill him dead.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.918
It's okay.

01:04:03.971 --> 01:04:06.722
- Security to Ward A. Okay.
- Ward A. I got it.

01:04:06.807 --> 01:04:08.808
The generator room's flooded.

01:04:08.892 --> 01:04:11.143
- Ward A. Ward A.
- See what we need in Ward B.

01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.728
Let's go.

01:04:13.063 --> 01:04:14.605
You okay, boss?

01:04:17.234 --> 01:04:19.235
This goddamn migraine.

01:04:19.319 --> 01:04:23.197
The backup generator's failed.
The whole place has gone crazy.

01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:26.200
What do you want to do?

01:04:32.583 --> 01:04:35.585
- Christ.
- Dan? Relax. Nope, nope, nope.

01:04:35.669 --> 01:04:38.087
You don't wanna do that.
Put it down. Now. Put it down.

01:04:38.171 --> 01:04:41.757
Grab him, grab him, grab him,
grab him! Get him, get him!

01:04:45.762 --> 01:04:48.806
You need to go find him
'cause he needs to be here.

01:04:48.891 --> 01:04:51.434
You think the whole electrical
system is fried?

01:04:51.518 --> 01:04:54.270
I'd say it's a good possibility, yeah.

01:04:54.354 --> 01:04:57.398
- All the electronic security, the fences ...
- Why are you always running?

01:04:57.482 --> 01:05:00.651
the gates, the doors.
- Why is it you every time? Come on.

01:05:00.736 --> 01:05:04.697
Nice day for a stroll, don't you think?
To Ward C, for example.

01:05:07.284 --> 01:05:10.369
- Come on.
- Maybe we'll run into Andrew Laeddis.

01:05:15.375 --> 01:05:18.336
The guy I told you about,
George Noyce?

01:05:18.420 --> 01:05:21.130
He told me this is where
they keep the worst ones.

01:05:21.214 --> 01:05:23.841
Guys even the other inmates
are scared of.

01:05:25.719 --> 01:05:28.012
Did Noyce give you anything
on the layout?

01:05:28.096 --> 01:05:31.849
Not really. All he remembered was
people screaming day and night,

01:05:31.934 --> 01:05:34.644
no windows and iron bars everywhere.

01:05:34.728 --> 01:05:35.895
Watch your head!

01:05:56.208 --> 01:05:58.209
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Jesus.

01:05:58.502 --> 01:06:00.544
First time on Ward C, huh?

01:06:01.588 --> 01:06:03.297
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:03.382 --> 01:06:04.423
We heard stories, but ...

01:06:04.508 --> 01:06:07.134
Trust me, son, you haven't heard shit.

01:06:07.594 --> 01:06:09.762
We got most of the bugsies
locked down now,

01:06:10.097 --> 01:06:12.014
but some of them are still loose.

01:06:12.099 --> 01:06:14.809
And if you see one,
don't try to restrain him yourselves.

01:06:14.893 --> 01:06:17.269
These fuckers will kill you. Clear?

01:06:18.355 --> 01:06:21.273
All right, get your asses moving then.
Go on.

01:07:17.998 --> 01:07:19.331
He's here.

01:07:23.336 --> 01:07:26.756
Laeddis. I can feel him.

01:07:31.011 --> 01:07:32.762
Tag! You're it!

01:07:32.846 --> 01:07:34.847
Wait! Boss! Ted!

01:07:44.399 --> 01:07:46.067
Hey! Hey!

01:07:47.527 --> 01:07:48.694
Teddy.

01:08:30.654 --> 01:08:32.113
Listen to me.

01:08:33.198 --> 01:08:36.117
Listen, I don't wanna leave here,
all right?

01:08:36.576 --> 01:08:38.786
I mean, why would anybody want to?

01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:42.331
We hear things here
about the outside world.

01:08:42.415 --> 01:08:45.835
- About atolls, about H-bomb tests.
- Teddy, where are you?

01:08:45.919 --> 01:08:47.920
You know how a hydrogen bomb works?

01:08:48.004 --> 01:08:51.257
- I know. With hydrogen! With hydrogen.
- Ah, that's funny.

01:08:51.341 --> 01:08:54.260
- Boss!
- Other bombs explode, right?

01:08:55.095 --> 01:08:56.679
But not the hydrogen bomb.

01:08:56.763 --> 01:09:02.226
It implodes, creating an explosion
to the thousandth, the millionth degree!

01:09:02.686 --> 01:09:04.311
- Do you get it?
- Yeah! Yeah.

01:09:04.396 --> 01:09:05.980
- Do you?
- I get it, I get it!

01:09:06.064 --> 01:09:07.314
Let him go!

01:09:10.944 --> 01:09:12.027
No!

01:09:21.288 --> 01:09:23.289
No! No!

01:09:24.708 --> 01:09:26.458
What are you doing?

01:09:26.751 --> 01:09:29.461
Jesus Christ, Teddy. Jesus!

01:09:29.796 --> 01:09:31.046
Oh, you got Billings.

01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:33.632
What the fuck's
the matter with you guys?

01:09:33.717 --> 01:09:34.800
Catch them, not kill them!

01:09:34.885 --> 01:09:37.845
- He jumped us.
- You, give me a hand with him.

01:09:37.929 --> 01:09:40.347
We've gotta get him to
the infirmary. God damn it.

01:09:40.432 --> 01:09:43.017
No, no! Not you, not you.
Take a walk.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.146
Come on. Cawley's gonna have
my goddamn balls for this.

01:10:18.094 --> 01:10:20.304
Laeddis.

01:10:40.533 --> 01:10:42.117
Laeddis.

01:10:53.171 --> 01:10:55.756
Stop me, please,

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.383
before I kill more.

01:10:59.386 --> 01:11:01.887
Stop me before I kill more.

01:11:02.305 --> 01:11:04.223
Laeddis.

01:11:12.315 --> 01:11:14.233
Please, please.

01:11:18.488 --> 01:11:20.447
I see you all.

01:11:21.199 --> 01:11:24.576
Laeddis.

01:11:30.917 --> 01:11:33.669
You told me I'd be free of this place.

01:11:34.754 --> 01:11:36.672
You promised.

01:11:38.258 --> 01:11:39.717
You lied.

01:11:40.260 --> 01:11:41.593
Laeddis.

01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:48.434
Laeddis?

01:11:48.893 --> 01:11:51.478
That's pretty damn funny.

01:11:53.898 --> 01:11:56.442
- Your voice.
- Don't you recognize it?

01:11:57.736 --> 01:11:59.862
After all the talks we had?

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:02.823
After all the lies you told me?

01:12:02.907 --> 01:12:04.700
Let me see your face.

01:12:05.201 --> 01:12:07.161
They say I'm theirs now.

01:12:08.288 --> 01:12:10.622
They say I'll never leave here.

01:12:11.875 --> 01:12:14.043
Your match is about to go out.

01:12:16.629 --> 01:12:19.381
- Let me see your goddamn face! Now!
- Why?

01:12:19.799 --> 01:12:21.258
So you can lie to me more?

01:12:22.135 --> 01:12:24.345
- This isn't about the truth.
- Yes, it is.

01:12:24.512 --> 01:12:28.015
- It's about exposing the truth.
- It's about you!

01:12:28.308 --> 01:12:29.808
And Laeddis.

01:12:31.144 --> 01:12:33.103
That's all it's ever been about.

01:12:34.189 --> 01:12:37.900
I was incidental. A way in.

01:12:41.237 --> 01:12:43.906
George ... George Noyce.

01:12:45.075 --> 01:12:48.535
No. It's not possible.
You can't be here.

01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:49.995
You like it?

01:12:51.706 --> 01:12:53.624
Who did this to you, George?

01:12:53.708 --> 01:12:54.958
You did.

01:12:55.502 --> 01:12:56.919
What the hell do you mean?

01:12:57.003 --> 01:13:01.173
All your talk. All your fucking talk,
and I'm back in here because of you.

01:13:01.257 --> 01:13:03.842
George, how did they get you
out of Dedham, huh?

01:13:03.927 --> 01:13:05.094
However this happened, I ...

01:13:05.178 --> 01:13:07.137
I'm gonna find a way to fix this,
you understand me?

01:13:07.222 --> 01:13:11.100
I'll never get out now. I got out once.
Not twice, never twice.

01:13:11.184 --> 01:13:13.060
Just tell me how they got you here.

01:13:13.144 --> 01:13:15.854
They knew! Don't you get it?

01:13:16.523 --> 01:13:19.316
Everything you were up to.
Your whole plan.

01:13:20.110 --> 01:13:23.779
This is a game.
All of this is for you.

01:13:24.489 --> 01:13:28.951
You're not investigating anything.
You're a fucking rat in a maze.

01:13:30.328 --> 01:13:31.537
Georgie ...

01:13:32.163 --> 01:13:35.290
- George, you're wrong. You're wrong.
- Oh, really?

01:13:36.376 --> 01:13:38.377
Been alone much since you got here?

01:13:40.046 --> 01:13:41.713
I've been with my partner.

01:13:42.382 --> 01:13:44.133
You never worked with him before,
have you?

01:13:46.511 --> 01:13:48.929
He's a U.S. Marshal. He's ...

01:13:49.013 --> 01:13:51.849
You never worked
with him before, have you?

01:13:54.644 --> 01:13:58.522
George, look, I know people.
I trust this man.

01:14:03.486 --> 01:14:05.487
Then they've already won.

01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:09.575
Fuck.

01:14:14.330 --> 01:14:17.374
And they're gonna take me
to the lighthouse.

01:14:19.002 --> 01:14:20.836
They're gonna cut into my brain.

01:14:22.297 --> 01:14:23.922
And I'm only here ...

01:14:24.257 --> 01:14:25.591
because of you!

01:14:26.634 --> 01:14:29.011
George, I'm gonna get you out of here.

01:14:29.095 --> 01:14:31.346
You're not going to the lighthouse.
You're not.

01:14:31.431 --> 01:14:34.183
You can't dig out the truth
and kill Laeddis at the same time.

01:14:34.267 --> 01:14:37.853
You gotta make a choice.
You understand that, don't you?

01:14:38.271 --> 01:14:41.273
- I'm not here to kill anyone.
- Liar!

01:14:41.357 --> 01:14:44.443
I'm not gonna kill him,
I swear to you! I swear.

01:14:44.694 --> 01:14:46.069
She's dead.

01:14:47.113 --> 01:14:48.780
She ... Let her go.

01:14:50.283 --> 01:14:51.658
Let her go.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.913
Tell him, Teddy.
Tell him why.

01:14:58.625 --> 01:15:01.293
You gotta do it.
There's no other way.

01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.420
- Let her go.
- Tell him about the day ...

01:15:03.505 --> 01:15:06.381
you brought me my locket.
- You gotta do it!

01:15:06.466 --> 01:15:09.885
How I told you my heart was breaking
and you asked me why.

01:15:09.969 --> 01:15:12.846
She's fucking with your head.

01:15:12.931 --> 01:15:14.806
And I told you it was from happiness.

01:15:14.891 --> 01:15:17.351
She's gonna kill you.
She's gonna kill you.

01:15:20.396 --> 01:15:23.649
You wanna uncover the truth?
You gotta let her go.

01:15:25.818 --> 01:15:27.486
- I can't.
- You have to let her go!

01:15:27.570 --> 01:15:29.446
I can't! I can't.

01:15:36.329 --> 01:15:38.872
Then you'll never leave this island.

01:15:44.629 --> 01:15:45.837
Dolores.

01:15:52.845 --> 01:15:54.471
He's not in this ward.

01:15:56.683 --> 01:15:59.685
He was transferred out of here.

01:16:01.854 --> 01:16:06.692
If he's not in Ward A,
there's only one place he can be.

01:16:12.574 --> 01:16:14.116
The lighthouse.

01:16:21.457 --> 01:16:22.541
Hey,

01:16:25.044 --> 01:16:26.545
God help you.

01:16:35.388 --> 01:16:36.638
Boss, we got problems.

01:16:36.723 --> 01:16:39.308
McPherson and Cawley
are in the building.

01:16:39.392 --> 01:16:41.143
They heard an orderly went batshit
on a patient.

01:16:41.227 --> 01:16:44.104
They're looking all over the place for
him and they're on their way to the roof.

01:16:44.188 --> 01:16:46.064
Let's get the hell out of here.
This way.

01:16:49.068 --> 01:16:51.403
Just keep going. We belong here.

01:17:01.247 --> 01:17:03.040
What happened to you?

01:17:03.124 --> 01:17:04.750
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:06.668
where were you?

01:17:07.045 --> 01:17:11.798
After we got that guy to the infirmary,
I took a little detour to patient records.

01:17:11.883 --> 01:17:14.009
Did you ever find Laeddis?

01:17:14.093 --> 01:17:16.011
No. No, I never found him.

01:17:16.095 --> 01:17:19.014
Well, I got the next best thing.
His intake form.

01:17:19.098 --> 01:17:21.224
It was the only thing in his files.
There's no session notes,

01:17:21.309 --> 01:17:25.020
no incident reports, no photographs,
just this. It was weird.

01:17:25.104 --> 01:17:26.772
Here. Take a look.

01:17:27.607 --> 01:17:28.940
I'll look at it later.

01:17:30.943 --> 01:17:32.235
What's the matter, boss?

01:17:33.112 --> 01:17:35.614
I'll look it over later, that's all.

01:17:37.575 --> 01:17:40.952
- Ashecliffe's that way.
- I'm not going to Ashecliffe.

01:17:42.455 --> 01:17:44.414
I'm going to that lighthouse.

01:17:44.499 --> 01:17:46.833
I'm gonna find out what the fuck
is happening on this island.

01:18:00.973 --> 01:18:02.391
There it is.

01:18:03.226 --> 01:18:07.229
Damn. We're too far south.
We're gonna have to double back.

01:18:07.313 --> 01:18:09.523
There's no way we could cross
those rocks.

01:18:09.607 --> 01:18:11.274
There could be a way
behind those trees.

01:18:11.359 --> 01:18:14.444
Maybe a path that goes around the
rocks and leads over to the lighthouse.

01:18:14.529 --> 01:18:15.570
- Boss ...
- Come on.

01:18:15.655 --> 01:18:18.031
Wait, wait, what are we doing?
We got the intake form.

01:18:18.116 --> 01:18:19.908
It's proof there's a 67th patient,

01:18:19.992 --> 01:18:22.828
which they said, repeatedly,
doesn't exist.

01:18:23.287 --> 01:18:26.498
I'm getting to that lighthouse.
You understand?

01:18:28.835 --> 01:18:30.544
What the hell can I say to you
to stop you?

01:18:30.628 --> 01:18:32.921
Why would you want to, Chuck? Why?

01:18:33.005 --> 01:18:34.840
Because climbing down there
when it's dark ...

01:18:34.924 --> 01:18:38.093
is a thin step short of suicide,
that's why.

01:18:38.177 --> 01:18:41.596
Okay, maybe you better
sit this one out then.

01:18:43.182 --> 01:18:45.183
You brought me into this, boss,

01:18:45.268 --> 01:18:48.603
and now we're trapped here on
this rock, on this island,

01:18:48.688 --> 01:18:50.230
with no one to rely on but each other,

01:18:50.314 --> 01:18:53.775
and now you're acting like ...
- Like what? Like what?

01:18:54.402 --> 01:18:55.902
How am I acting?

01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:03.660
What the hell happened back there
in those cells, Ted?

01:19:08.374 --> 01:19:11.126
What do you think the weather's like
in Portland, Chuck?

01:19:11.711 --> 01:19:13.378
I'm from Seattle.

01:19:16.007 --> 01:19:17.257
Seattle.

01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:21.720
I'm going on ...

01:19:22.555 --> 01:19:23.764
alone.

01:19:26.142 --> 01:19:29.019
- I'm going with you, boss.
- I said alone.

01:19:30.730 --> 01:19:31.855
Fine.

01:19:58.508 --> 01:19:59.758
Damn it!

01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:02.052
Damn it.

01:20:07.266 --> 01:20:10.143
I knew it wouldn't take long,
but I couldn't get to it.

01:20:10.228 --> 01:20:11.770
The tide was up.

01:20:20.029 --> 01:20:24.866
Chuck!

01:21:26.429 --> 01:21:27.679
Come on!

01:22:03.049 --> 01:22:04.215
Chuck!

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:06.718
Where are you, Chuck?

01:22:31.369 --> 01:22:35.455
Chuck!

01:23:19.959 --> 01:23:21.334
Who are you?

01:23:23.462 --> 01:23:26.297
I'm Teddy Daniels. I'm a cop.

01:23:27.675 --> 01:23:29.384
You're the marshal.

01:23:30.344 --> 01:23:32.012
That's right.

01:23:34.181 --> 01:23:38.059
Would you mind taking your hand
from behind your back, please?

01:23:38.144 --> 01:23:39.978
Why? Why?

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:44.482
I wanna make sure that
what you're holding won't hurt me.

01:23:52.158 --> 01:23:53.867
I'm gonna keep this ...

01:23:55.369 --> 01:23:56.870
if you don't mind.

01:23:57.705 --> 01:23:59.122
Fine by me.

01:24:08.174 --> 01:24:09.507
You're ...

01:24:10.926 --> 01:24:12.761
You're Rachel Solando.

01:24:14.346 --> 01:24:15.764
The real one.

01:24:19.769 --> 01:24:21.394
Did you kill your children?

01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:25.023
I never had children.

01:24:25.691 --> 01:24:27.484
I was never married.

01:24:29.028 --> 01:24:32.572
And before I was a patient at
Ashecliffe, I worked here.

01:24:33.199 --> 01:24:35.784
You ... You were a nurse?

01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.080
I was a doctor, Marshal.

01:24:43.501 --> 01:24:45.210
You think I'm crazy.

01:24:45.586 --> 01:24:48.922
- No. No, no, I never ...
- And if I say I'm not crazy?

01:24:50.132 --> 01:24:52.550
Well, that hardly helps, does it?

01:24:53.385 --> 01:24:55.887
That's the Kafkaesque genius of it.

01:24:59.183 --> 01:25:01.476
People tell the world you're crazy,

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:05.480
and all your protests to the contrary
just confirm what they're saying.

01:25:06.065 --> 01:25:09.234
I'm not following you. I'm sorry.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:11.820
Once you're declared insane,

01:25:11.904 --> 01:25:15.406
then anything you do is called
part of that insanity.

01:25:15.491 --> 01:25:21.079
Reasonable protests are denial.
Valid fears, paranoia.

01:25:21.163 --> 01:25:22.747
Survival instincts are ...

01:25:23.749 --> 01:25:25.208
defense mechanisms.

01:25:25.543 --> 01:25:29.254
You're smarter than you look, Marshal.
That's probably not a good thing.

01:25:30.131 --> 01:25:32.799
- Tell me something.
- Yeah.

01:25:33.968 --> 01:25:35.760
What happened to you?

01:25:36.595 --> 01:25:40.014
I started asking about these
large shipments of sodium amytal ...

01:25:40.099 --> 01:25:41.850
and opium-based hallucinogens.

01:25:41.934 --> 01:25:43.643
Psychotropic drugs.

01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:47.397
I asked about the surgeries, too.

01:25:49.441 --> 01:25:51.609
You ever heard of
a transorbital lobotomy?

01:25:53.154 --> 01:25:55.864
They zap the patient
with electroshock,

01:25:55.948 --> 01:25:58.783
then go through the eye
with an ice pick,

01:26:00.953 --> 01:26:03.037
pull out some nerve fibers.

01:26:05.457 --> 01:26:07.917
Makes the patients much more obedient.

01:26:08.002 --> 01:26:09.335
Tractable.

01:26:10.796 --> 01:26:12.297
It's barbaric,

01:26:13.299 --> 01:26:14.799
unconscionable.

01:26:15.801 --> 01:26:19.554
Do you know how pain
enters the body, Marshal? Do you?

01:26:20.806 --> 01:26:22.265
Depends on where you're hurt?

01:26:22.349 --> 01:26:24.893
No, it has nothing
to do with the flesh.

01:26:25.311 --> 01:26:27.312
The brain controls pain.

01:26:28.147 --> 01:26:32.525
The brain controls fear, empathy, sleep,
hunger, anger. Everything.

01:26:34.862 --> 01:26:36.654
What if you could control it?

01:26:37.156 --> 01:26:40.158
- You mean the brain?
- Recreate a man ...

01:26:40.826 --> 01:26:45.413
so he doesn't feel pain or love
or sympathy.

01:26:46.957 --> 01:26:48.416
A man who can't be interrogated,

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.211
because he has no memories
to confess.

01:26:53.797 --> 01:26:57.467
You can never take away
all a man's memories. Never.

01:26:57.551 --> 01:27:01.679
Marshal, the North Koreans
used American POWs ...

01:27:01.764 --> 01:27:03.431
during their brainwashing experiments.

01:27:03.515 --> 01:27:06.935
They turned soldiers into traitors.
That's what they're doing here.

01:27:07.019 --> 01:27:09.103
They're creating ghosts
to go out in the world ...

01:27:09.188 --> 01:27:12.440
and do things sane men ...
Sane men never would.

01:27:12.524 --> 01:27:15.860
To have that kind of ability,
that kind of knowledge,

01:27:15.945 --> 01:27:18.613
that would take years.
- Years. Years of research.

01:27:18.697 --> 01:27:21.407
Hundreds of patients to experiment on.

01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:26.621
Fifty years from now, people will
look back and say, here, this place,

01:27:26.956 --> 01:27:29.165
is where it all began.

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:34.045
The Nazis used the Jews, Soviets used
prisoners in their own Gulags, and we,

01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:38.341
we tested patients on Shutter Island.

01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:41.678
No, they won't.

01:27:42.638 --> 01:27:43.638
No.

01:27:46.100 --> 01:27:48.226
You do understand ...

01:27:50.771 --> 01:27:53.064
that they can't let you leave.

01:27:53.357 --> 01:27:56.693
I am a federal marshal.
They can't stop me.

01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:03.157
I was an esteemed psychiatrist
from a respected family.

01:28:05.244 --> 01:28:06.869
Didn't matter.

01:28:09.581 --> 01:28:13.626
Let me ask you.
Any past traumas in your life?

01:28:15.004 --> 01:28:16.254
Yes.

01:28:17.423 --> 01:28:19.507
But why would that matter?

01:28:19.591 --> 01:28:21.884
Because they're gonna point
to some event in your past ...

01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:24.470
and say it's the reason
you lost your sanity.

01:28:24.555 --> 01:28:29.934
So that when they commit you here,
your friends and colleagues will say,

01:28:30.019 --> 01:28:31.936
"Of course he cracked.

01:28:32.938 --> 01:28:34.188
"Who wouldn't
after what he'd been through?"

01:28:34.273 --> 01:28:36.774
They can say that about anyone,
anyone at all.

01:28:36.859 --> 01:28:39.819
The point is
they're gonna say it about you.

01:28:43.073 --> 01:28:46.868
- How's your head?
- My head?

01:28:46.952 --> 01:28:50.371
Any funny dreams lately?
Trouble sleeping?

01:28:52.583 --> 01:28:56.919
- Headaches?
- I am prone to migraines, yes.

01:28:57.004 --> 01:28:58.296
Jesus.

01:29:00.591 --> 01:29:04.093
You haven't taken any pills,
have you? I mean, even aspirin?

01:29:04.178 --> 01:29:06.346
- The aspirin?
- Jesus.

01:29:07.014 --> 01:29:10.725
And you ate the food in the cafeteria
and drank the coffee they gave you?

01:29:10.809 --> 01:29:14.187
You tell me, at least, that you've
been smoking your own cigarettes.

01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:19.275
No.

01:29:20.361 --> 01:29:21.736
No, I haven't.

01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:24.572
It takes 36 to 48 hours
for neuroleptic narcotics ...

01:29:24.656 --> 01:29:27.241
to reach workable levels
in the bloodstream.

01:29:29.036 --> 01:29:30.870
Palsy comes first,

01:29:31.789 --> 01:29:35.249
first the fingertips,
then eventually the whole hand.

01:29:36.168 --> 01:29:40.338
Seen any walking nightmares
lately, Marshal? Huh?

01:29:42.841 --> 01:29:45.802
Tell me what goes on
in that lighthouse.

01:29:46.678 --> 01:29:48.012
Tell me.

01:29:49.181 --> 01:29:50.807
Brain surgery.

01:29:51.475 --> 01:29:55.937
The let's-open-the-skull-and-see-
what-happens-if-we-pull-on-this kind.

01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:59.357
The learned-it-from-the-Nazis kind.

01:30:01.443 --> 01:30:03.903
That's where they create the ghosts.

01:30:05.322 --> 01:30:09.200
Who knows about this?
On the island, I mean. Who?

01:30:11.537 --> 01:30:12.787
Everyone.

01:30:12.871 --> 01:30:16.582
Come on. The nurses? The orderlies?

01:30:17.167 --> 01:30:20.461
- They couldn't possibly know ...
- Everyone.

01:30:39.398 --> 01:30:40.940
You can't stay here.

01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:42.859
They think I'm dead,
that I drowned.

01:30:42.943 --> 01:30:45.945
I'm afraid if they come looking
for you, they might find me.

01:30:46.029 --> 01:30:48.406
I'm sorry, but you have to go.

01:30:55.038 --> 01:30:56.664
I'm gonna come back for you.

01:30:56.748 --> 01:30:59.709
I won't be here. I move during
the day. New places every night.

01:30:59.793 --> 01:31:02.128
But I could come get you,
get you off this island.

01:31:02.212 --> 01:31:04.130
Haven't you heard a word I've said?

01:31:05.007 --> 01:31:08.259
The only way off the island is
the ferry, and they control it.

01:31:09.219 --> 01:31:11.262
You'll never leave here.

01:31:20.606 --> 01:31:22.398
I had a friend.

01:31:22.483 --> 01:31:24.984
I was with him yesterday,
but we got separated.

01:31:26.111 --> 01:31:27.778
Have you seen him?

01:31:28.947 --> 01:31:30.281
Marshal,

01:31:31.825 --> 01:31:33.951
you have no friends.

01:32:06.276 --> 01:32:07.818
There you are.

01:32:10.656 --> 01:32:13.324
We were wondering
when you'd show up.

01:32:14.952 --> 01:32:16.494
Have a seat.

01:32:16.954 --> 01:32:18.246
Come on.

01:32:28.924 --> 01:32:31.551
Taking a leisurely stroll, were we?

01:32:32.636 --> 01:32:35.680
I was just looking around.

01:32:38.642 --> 01:32:41.060
Did you enjoy God's latest gift?

01:32:42.688 --> 01:32:44.021
- What?
- God's gift.

01:32:46.191 --> 01:32:47.525
The violence.

01:32:50.362 --> 01:32:54.740
When I came downstairs in my home
and I saw that tree in my living room,

01:32:54.825 --> 01:32:58.661
it reached out for me
like a divine hand.

01:33:00.872 --> 01:33:02.707
God loves violence.

01:33:05.377 --> 01:33:08.212
- I hadn't noticed.
- Sure you have.

01:33:09.381 --> 01:33:11.549
Why else would there be so much of it?

01:33:11.883 --> 01:33:13.259
It's in us.

01:33:13.802 --> 01:33:15.136
It's what we are.

01:33:16.555 --> 01:33:18.889
We wage war, we burn sacrifices,

01:33:18.974 --> 01:33:21.517
and pillage and plunder and tear
at the flesh of our brothers.

01:33:21.602 --> 01:33:25.521
And why? Because God gave us
violence to wage in his honor.

01:33:28.734 --> 01:33:31.152
I thought God gave us moral order.

01:33:31.236 --> 01:33:34.238
There's no moral order
as pure as this storm.

01:33:34.865 --> 01:33:38.409
There's no moral order at all.
There's just this,

01:33:39.036 --> 01:33:41.203
can my violence conquer yours?

01:33:46.585 --> 01:33:49.003
- I'm not violent.
- Yes, you are.

01:33:50.130 --> 01:33:52.548
You're as violent as they come.

01:33:53.258 --> 01:33:56.844
I know this
because I'm as violent as they come.

01:33:56.928 --> 01:33:59.096
If the constraints
of society were lifted,

01:33:59.181 --> 01:34:01.849
and I was all that stood
between you and a meal,

01:34:01.933 --> 01:34:05.311
you would crack my skull with
a rock and eat my meaty parts.

01:34:07.272 --> 01:34:08.856
Wouldn't you?

01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:14.070
Cawley thinks you're harmless,
that you can be controlled,

01:34:14.154 --> 01:34:16.030
but I know different.

01:34:16.657 --> 01:34:18.407
- You don't know me.
- Oh, but I do.

01:34:18.492 --> 01:34:21.118
- No, you don't. You don't know me at all.
- Oh, I know you.

01:34:21.745 --> 01:34:24.455
We've known each other for centuries.

01:34:33.799 --> 01:34:36.717
If I was to sink my teeth
into your eye right now,

01:34:36.802 --> 01:34:40.137
would you be able to stop me
before I blinded you?

01:34:44.267 --> 01:34:45.893
Give it a try.

01:34:47.437 --> 01:34:49.146
That's the spirit.

01:35:23.890 --> 01:35:27.226
Don't worry, because we're going
to get you back to your room.

01:35:28.145 --> 01:35:29.812
- Not really.
- Something I've seen.

01:35:29.896 --> 01:35:31.147
Okay.

01:35:36.361 --> 01:35:38.112
Where have you been?

01:35:38.196 --> 01:35:40.948
Oh, just wandering.
Just looking at your island.

01:35:41.032 --> 01:35:44.702
Oh, I forgot you're leaving
now that Rachel's been found.

01:35:45.537 --> 01:35:46.954
- Stop looking at him.
- For sure. Yeah.

01:35:47.038 --> 01:35:49.081
Stop looking at him.
Stop looking at him.

01:35:50.375 --> 01:35:52.209
- Big meeting?
- Oh, yes.

01:35:52.294 --> 01:35:53.544
- It's okay. I'm ...
- I don't like that.

01:35:54.212 --> 01:35:56.213
Apparently there was
an unidentified man ...

01:35:56.298 --> 01:35:57.590
in Ward C yesterday.

01:35:57.674 --> 01:36:01.051
He subdued a highly dangerous
patient quite handily.

01:36:01.636 --> 01:36:02.636
Is that so?

01:36:02.721 --> 01:36:05.181
It seems he had a long conversation
with a paranoid schizophrenic,

01:36:05.265 --> 01:36:06.474
George Noyce.

01:36:06.558 --> 01:36:09.351
Well, I don't remember
what I'm supposed to remember.

01:36:09.436 --> 01:36:11.145
We're gated down. We're fine.

01:36:11.229 --> 01:36:15.274
This Noyce, you said his name was,
he's delusional?

01:36:15.358 --> 01:36:18.068
Oh, extremely.
He can be quite upsetting.

01:36:18.153 --> 01:36:19.862
As a matter of fact, two weeks ago,

01:36:19.946 --> 01:36:24.408
a patient got so wound up by one
of Noyce's stories that he beat him up.

01:36:25.118 --> 01:36:26.577
- Hmm.
- Cigarette?

01:36:28.872 --> 01:36:30.664
No, thanks. I quit.

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:35.795
- So you're taking the ferry?
- Yes, absolutely.

01:36:35.879 --> 01:36:38.589
I think we've gotten
all we came here for, so ...

01:36:39.424 --> 01:36:40.758
"We," Marshal?

01:36:42.761 --> 01:36:46.347
Speaking of which,
have you seen him, Doctor?

01:36:46.431 --> 01:36:47.598
Who?

01:36:48.433 --> 01:36:50.142
My partner, Chuck.

01:36:52.479 --> 01:36:55.314
You don't have a partner, Marshal.
You came here alone.

01:36:57.776 --> 01:36:59.944
You know, I've built
something valuable here,

01:37:00.028 --> 01:37:03.197
and valuable things have a way of
being misunderstood in their own time.

01:37:03.281 --> 01:37:05.366
Everyone wants a quick fix.
They always have.

01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:09.036
I'm trying to do something that people,
yourself included, don't understand.

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:12.081
And I'm not going to give up
without a fight.

01:37:13.917 --> 01:37:15.543
I can see that.

01:37:17.462 --> 01:37:18.587
Mmm.

01:37:19.631 --> 01:37:22.258
So, tell me again about your partner.

01:37:23.969 --> 01:37:25.594
What partner?

01:37:28.348 --> 01:37:29.431
It's fine.

01:38:17.772 --> 01:38:21.191
She made a mess.
I cleaned it up. She made a mess again.

01:38:30.869 --> 01:38:32.244
Marshal,

01:38:33.622 --> 01:38:35.247
going somewhere?

01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:38.459
I'm just heading out
to the ferry, so ...

01:38:38.543 --> 01:38:42.087
Ah! Oh, well,
I'm afraid it's the other way.

01:38:43.632 --> 01:38:44.715
Oh?

01:38:45.717 --> 01:38:50.387
If you'll wait a moment, I'll find you
someone who can take you to the dock.

01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:58.896
- What's this, Doctor? Huh? What's this?
- It's just a sedative.

01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:02.149
- A precaution.
- Oh! A precaution.

01:39:04.361 --> 01:39:07.947
What are you going to do? Kill me?

01:39:08.281 --> 01:39:11.075
- Marshal.
- You think you deserve it?

01:39:11.159 --> 01:39:13.953
For what, hmm? Provoking you?

01:39:14.746 --> 01:39:17.581
Well, forgive me.
What doesn't provoke you?

01:39:18.124 --> 01:39:21.085
- Remarks? Words?
- Nazis?

01:39:21.711 --> 01:39:25.756
Well, that, too.
And, of course, memories, dreams.

01:39:26.841 --> 01:39:31.095
Did you know that the word "trauma"
comes from the Greek for "wound"?

01:39:31.763 --> 01:39:34.515
And what is the German word
for "dream"?

01:39:34.599 --> 01:39:36.767
Traum. Ein Traum.

01:39:38.144 --> 01:39:41.105
Wounds can create monsters,
and you ...

01:39:41.773 --> 01:39:44.149
You are wounded, Marshal.

01:39:45.193 --> 01:39:48.362
And wouldn't you agree,
when you see a monster,

01:39:49.072 --> 01:39:50.823
you must stop it?

01:39:51.408 --> 01:39:52.616
Yeah.

01:39:53.785 --> 01:39:55.619
- I agree.
- Yes.

01:39:56.454 --> 01:39:57.538
Yeah.

01:40:14.764 --> 01:40:17.016
I told him that we'd take
about an hour to do it.

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:20.185
Yeah. Did they say
we're going to do the first floor?

01:40:20.270 --> 01:40:21.520
How long you been the clock?

01:40:21.604 --> 01:40:23.981
I've been on for 18 hours straight.

01:40:24.441 --> 01:40:25.983
Nice paycheck.

01:40:42.459 --> 01:40:44.543
What are you doing, baby?

01:40:49.340 --> 01:40:51.842
- You gotta get to the ferry.
- No.

01:40:52.594 --> 01:40:53.886
No, no.

01:40:55.096 --> 01:40:56.263
Yeah.

01:40:57.390 --> 01:41:02.269
If the world thinks that Chuck is dead,
then he's perfect for their experiments.

01:41:03.354 --> 01:41:05.606
There's only one place they'd take him.

01:41:08.234 --> 01:41:10.778
- You go there and you'll die.
- He's my partner.

01:41:10.862 --> 01:41:12.946
If they are hurting him, if they're
holding him against his will,

01:41:13.031 --> 01:41:14.740
I've gotta bring him out.

01:41:14.949 --> 01:41:16.992
I can't lose anyone else.

01:41:17.077 --> 01:41:18.327
Don't go, Teddy, please.

01:41:18.411 --> 01:41:21.830
- Please, don't do this. Don't go.
- I'm sorry, honey.

01:41:25.418 --> 01:41:27.211
I'm sorry, honey.

01:41:28.296 --> 01:41:31.340
I love this thing
because you gave it to me,

01:41:33.718 --> 01:41:35.552
but the truth is ...

01:41:37.222 --> 01:41:39.389
it is one fucking ugly tie.

01:42:19.597 --> 01:42:20.764
No.

01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.056
Don't move. Stay where you are.

01:43:46.059 --> 01:43:47.476
Are you gonna kill me?

01:43:49.145 --> 01:43:51.688
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

01:45:44.302 --> 01:45:46.178
Why are you all wet, baby?

01:45:48.389 --> 01:45:51.641
- What did you say?
- You know exactly what I said.

01:46:04.739 --> 01:46:06.990
The rifle's empty, by the way.

01:46:13.498 --> 01:46:14.998
Have a seat.

01:46:21.506 --> 01:46:23.924
For God's sake, dry off.
You'll catch cold.

01:46:25.551 --> 01:46:26.676
All right.

01:46:30.223 --> 01:46:32.140
How badly did you hurt the guard?

01:46:33.851 --> 01:46:36.853
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:46:40.024 --> 01:46:41.942
Yes, he's here.

01:46:42.026 --> 01:46:46.029
Have Dr. Sheehan take a look
at your man before you send him up.

01:46:46.114 --> 01:46:50.826
So Dr. Sheehan came in on the ferry
this morning, huh?

01:46:51.786 --> 01:46:53.286
Not exactly.

01:46:54.330 --> 01:46:57.374
You blew up my car.
I really loved that car.

01:46:58.292 --> 01:47:00.377
Sorry to hear about that.

01:47:03.673 --> 01:47:06.049
Tremors are getting pretty bad.

01:47:06.676 --> 01:47:09.094
How are the hallucinations?

01:47:09.178 --> 01:47:13.348
Get out of here, Teddy.
This place is gonna be the end of you.

01:47:17.103 --> 01:47:18.228
Not bad.

01:47:18.312 --> 01:47:20.897
- They'll get worse.
- I know.

01:47:21.774 --> 01:47:26.069
Dr. Solando,
she told me about the neuroleptics.

01:47:26.612 --> 01:47:29.072
Did she, now? And when was this?

01:47:29.157 --> 01:47:33.952
I found her, Doctor,
in a cave out by the cliffs.

01:47:34.036 --> 01:47:36.580
- But you'll never get to her.
- I don't doubt it,

01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:39.207
considering she's not real.

01:47:41.127 --> 01:47:44.254
Your delusions are more severe
than I thought.

01:47:45.465 --> 01:47:47.632
You're not on neuroleptics.

01:47:48.092 --> 01:47:49.968
You're not on anything,
as a matter of fact.

01:47:50.052 --> 01:47:52.679
Then what the fuck is this? Huh?
What the fuck is this?

01:47:52.763 --> 01:47:53.763
Withdrawal.

01:47:54.765 --> 01:47:56.725
Withdrawal? From what?

01:47:56.809 --> 01:47:59.144
I haven't had a goddamn drink
since I've been on this island.

01:47:59.228 --> 01:48:00.854
Chlorpromazine.

01:48:01.689 --> 01:48:04.941
I'm not a fan of pharmacology,
but I have to say, in your case ...

01:48:05.443 --> 01:48:08.695
- Chloraproma-what?
- Chlorpromazine.

01:48:08.779 --> 01:48:12.782
The same thing we've been giving you
for the past 24 months.

01:48:14.076 --> 01:48:16.203
Oh, so for the past two years, you ...

01:48:16.287 --> 01:48:19.581
You've had somebody slipping me drugs
in Boston. Is that it?

01:48:19.665 --> 01:48:21.124
Not Boston.

01:48:21.626 --> 01:48:22.792
Here.

01:48:23.586 --> 01:48:27.547
You've been here for two years.
A patient of this institution.

01:48:31.302 --> 01:48:33.470
After everything
I've seen here, Doctor,

01:48:35.139 --> 01:48:38.558
you really think you're gonna
convince me I'm crazy, huh?

01:48:38.643 --> 01:48:40.602
Do you know the kind of people
that I deal with every day?

01:48:40.686 --> 01:48:42.562
I'm a U.S. Marshal, for God's sakes.

01:48:42.647 --> 01:48:44.523
You were a U.S. Marshal.

01:48:44.607 --> 01:48:48.401
Here's a copy of the intake form
you broke into Ward C for.

01:48:48.486 --> 01:48:49.861
Proof of the 67th patient.

01:48:49.946 --> 01:48:51.112
If you'd gotten it to the mainland,

01:48:51.197 --> 01:48:52.989
you could have blown the lid
off this place.

01:48:53.074 --> 01:48:54.449
- Wait. Where did ... Where did you ...
- Yet somehow,

01:48:54.534 --> 01:48:57.452
you couldn't find time to look at it.
Well, read it now.

01:48:58.329 --> 01:48:59.704
Go ahead.

01:49:03.501 --> 01:49:07.337
"Patient is highly intelligent, highly
delusional decorated Army veteran.

01:49:07.421 --> 01:49:10.006
"Present for the liberation of Dachau.

01:49:11.259 --> 01:49:13.885
"Former U.S. Marshal.
Known proclivity for violence.

01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:17.222
"Shows no remorse for his crime
because he denies the crime ever ...

01:49:17.306 --> 01:49:18.348
"Ever took place.

01:49:18.432 --> 01:49:20.308
"Highly developed
and fantastical narratives,

01:49:20.393 --> 01:49:22.769
"which preclude
facing the truth of his actions."

01:49:22.853 --> 01:49:25.522
I've had enough of this bullshit!
Where's my partner, huh?

01:49:25.606 --> 01:49:27.190
Where's Chuck? Where is he?

01:49:27.984 --> 01:49:29.693
Let's try this another way.

01:49:29.777 --> 01:49:32.320
Your wife's maiden name was Chanal,
am I correct?

01:49:32.405 --> 01:49:33.822
Don't you even talk about her.
Don't you ...

01:49:33.906 --> 01:49:35.782
I'm afraid I have to.

01:49:37.827 --> 01:49:39.995
Notice anything
these four names have in common?

01:49:40.204 --> 01:49:41.705
It's your rule of four.

01:49:42.164 --> 01:49:43.290
Andrew, what do you see?

01:49:43.374 --> 01:49:46.376
If you've done anything to my partner,
Doctor, that is a violation of ...

01:49:46.460 --> 01:49:48.878
Focus, Andrew! What do you see?

01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:52.382
The names have the same letters.

01:49:53.259 --> 01:49:56.678
Edward Daniels has exactly the
same 13 letters as Andrew Laeddis.

01:49:56.762 --> 01:49:58.972
The same as Rachel Solando
and Dolores Chanal.

01:49:59.056 --> 01:50:01.141
The names are anagrams
for each other.

01:50:01.225 --> 01:50:03.810
Your tactics,
they're not gonna work on me.

01:50:03.894 --> 01:50:06.688
You came here for the truth.
Here it is.

01:50:06.772 --> 01:50:08.773
Your name is Andrew Laeddis.

01:50:08.858 --> 01:50:12.402
The 67th patient at Ashecliffe
is you, Andrew.

01:50:14.238 --> 01:50:15.196
Bullshit.

01:50:15.281 --> 01:50:17.490
You were committed here
by court order 24 months ago.

01:50:17.575 --> 01:50:20.910
Your crime is terrible, one
you can't forgive yourself for,

01:50:20.995 --> 01:50:23.330
so you invented another self.

01:50:25.541 --> 01:50:26.958
All right.

01:50:27.460 --> 01:50:30.128
Let's get down
to the facts, all right?

01:50:30.212 --> 01:50:33.089
You've created a story
in which you're not a murderer.

01:50:33.174 --> 01:50:37.218
You're a hero, still a U.S. Marshal, only
here at Ashecliffe because of a case,

01:50:37.303 --> 01:50:38.803
and you've uncovered a conspiracy ...

01:50:38.888 --> 01:50:42.432
so that anything we tell you
about who you are, what you've done,

01:50:42.516 --> 01:50:44.559
you can dismiss as lies, Andrew.

01:50:44.644 --> 01:50:45.935
My name is Edward Daniels.

01:50:46.020 --> 01:50:50.273
I've been hearing this fantasy for
two years now. I know every detail.

01:50:50.358 --> 01:50:52.317
Patient 67, the storm,

01:50:52.401 --> 01:50:55.612
Rachel Solando, your missing partner,
the dreams you have every night.

01:50:55.696 --> 01:50:58.114
You were at Dachau, but you may
not have killed any guards.

01:51:02.161 --> 01:51:05.830
I wish I could let you
just live in your fantasy world.

01:51:05.915 --> 01:51:07.374
I really do.

01:51:08.250 --> 01:51:10.460
But you're violent, trained, dangerous.

01:51:10.544 --> 01:51:12.837
You're the most dangerous patient
we have.

01:51:12.922 --> 01:51:15.215
You've injured orderlies, guards,
other patients.

01:51:15.299 --> 01:51:17.217
Two weeks ago,
you attacked George Noyce.

01:51:17.301 --> 01:51:19.552
No, no. I am fucking on to you, Doctor.

01:51:19.637 --> 01:51:21.513
- You had Noyce beaten.
- Of course I didn't!

01:51:21.597 --> 01:51:23.682
Give me one reason
why I would even touch him!

01:51:23.766 --> 01:51:26.142
Because he called you Laeddis,

01:51:26.227 --> 01:51:29.270
and you'd do anything not to be him.

01:51:29.355 --> 01:51:32.941
I have a transcript of the conversation
you had with Noyce yesterday.

01:51:33.025 --> 01:51:37.070
"This is about you, and, Laeddis,
that's all it's ever been about."

01:51:38.989 --> 01:51:41.491
No, no. He's saying
this is about me and Laeddis.

01:51:41.575 --> 01:51:43.451
When you asked him
what happened to his face,

01:51:43.536 --> 01:51:46.913
he said, now here I'm quoting again,
"You did this."

01:51:46.997 --> 01:51:49.124
No, no, he meant that it was my fault.

01:51:49.208 --> 01:51:51.209
You almost killed him.

01:51:52.878 --> 01:51:55.672
The warden and the Board of Overseers
are determined something be done.

01:51:55.756 --> 01:51:57.465
It's been decided ...

01:51:57.550 --> 01:52:00.385
that unless we can bring you
back to sanity now,

01:52:00.678 --> 01:52:01.970
right now,

01:52:02.263 --> 01:52:05.682
permanent measures will be taken to
ensure you can't hurt anyone ever again.

01:52:09.186 --> 01:52:12.522
They'll lobotomize you, Andrew.
Do you understand?

01:52:16.777 --> 01:52:18.695
Yeah, I understand.

01:52:19.530 --> 01:52:21.740
I understand just fine.

01:52:22.366 --> 01:52:26.453
If I don't play along
with your little game here,

01:52:26.537 --> 01:52:29.664
Dr. Naehring's gonna turn me
into one of his ghosts.

01:52:30.124 --> 01:52:31.499
But what about my partner?

01:52:31.584 --> 01:52:36.045
You gonna tell the U.S. Marshal's office
that he's a defense mechanism?

01:52:37.923 --> 01:52:39.382
Hello, boss.

01:52:56.233 --> 01:52:59.402
What the fuck
is going on here? Hmm?

01:53:00.488 --> 01:53:01.571
Huh?

01:53:01.906 --> 01:53:05.533
You working for him?

01:53:06.368 --> 01:53:07.869
I'm sorry. There wasn't any other way.

01:53:07.953 --> 01:53:10.872
Someone had to stick with you,
keep you safe.

01:53:13.751 --> 01:53:15.877
You been watching me, huh?

01:53:16.837 --> 01:53:18.922
Watching me every minute.

01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.132
Who are you?

01:53:21.884 --> 01:53:22.967
Who are you? Tell me.

01:53:23.636 --> 01:53:25.637
Don't you recognize me, Andrew?

01:53:27.056 --> 01:53:30.767
I've been your primary psychiatrist
for the last two years.

01:53:31.352 --> 01:53:33.228
I'm Lester Sheehan.

01:53:39.693 --> 01:53:42.362
- I told you ― I told you about my wife, I ―
- I know.

01:53:42.446 --> 01:53:45.698
I climbed down a cliff to get you.
I trusted you.

01:53:45.783 --> 01:53:49.410
I risked everything to come in here
after you. Everything!

01:53:49.495 --> 01:53:52.247
- I know, boss.
- We're running out of time here, Andrew.

01:53:53.791 --> 01:53:55.375
I swore before
the Board of Overseers ...

01:53:55.459 --> 01:53:59.379
that I could construct the most
radical, cutting-edge role-play ...

01:53:59.463 --> 01:54:01.714
ever attempted in psychiatry,
and it would bring you back.

01:54:01.799 --> 01:54:04.175
I thought that if we let
you play this out ...

01:54:04.927 --> 01:54:08.555
we could get you to see how untrue,
how impossible it is.

01:54:09.640 --> 01:54:12.100
You've had the run of the place
for two days.

01:54:12.184 --> 01:54:15.478
Tell me, where are
the Nazi experiments?

01:54:15.563 --> 01:54:17.355
The satanic ORs?

01:54:30.995 --> 01:54:34.539
Andrew, listen to me.

01:54:35.249 --> 01:54:36.833
If we fail with you,

01:54:37.585 --> 01:54:41.504
then everything that we've tried to do
here will be discredited. Everything.

01:54:43.632 --> 01:54:46.801
We're on the front lines of a war
here, old boy.

01:54:47.553 --> 01:54:50.430
And right now,
it all comes down to you.

01:54:57.354 --> 01:55:00.064
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Andrew! Andrew! No. No.

01:55:00.149 --> 01:55:03.359
My name is Edward Daniels!

01:55:03.444 --> 01:55:05.486
This one's loaded.
I can tell by the weight.

01:55:05.571 --> 01:55:08.156
I see. And that's your firearm,
Marshal? You're sure?

01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.449
My initials are on the side.

01:55:09.533 --> 01:55:11.826
There's a dent in the barrel
from when Philip Stacks shot at me.

01:55:11.911 --> 01:55:14.037
You're not gonna fuck with my mind
on this one, Doctor!

01:55:14.121 --> 01:55:15.163
Then blast away.

01:55:15.247 --> 01:55:18.583
Because that's the only way
you're ever getting off this island.

01:55:24.673 --> 01:55:26.549
Andrew, please don't.

01:55:37.436 --> 01:55:38.728
My gun.

01:55:45.319 --> 01:55:47.904
What did you do to my goddamn gun?

01:55:48.322 --> 01:55:50.490
It's a toy, Andrew.

01:55:52.993 --> 01:55:55.078
We're telling you the truth.

01:55:55.579 --> 01:55:58.831
Dolores was insane,
manic-depressive, suicidal.

01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.585
You drank, stayed away,
ignored what everyone told you.

01:56:02.670 --> 01:56:03.795
You moved to that lake house ...

01:56:03.879 --> 01:56:07.006
after she purposely set
your city apartment on fire.

01:56:07.091 --> 01:56:08.383
- You were ...
- You're lying!

01:56:08.467 --> 01:56:11.928
- Andrew! Andrew, stop. No.
- You drugged the cigarettes!

01:56:12.012 --> 01:56:13.846
- All you've done is lie!
- Andrew. Andrew.

01:56:13.931 --> 01:56:16.474
Your children.
Andrew, your children.

01:56:17.226 --> 01:56:19.894
Simon. Henry.

01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:21.562
I never had any children.

01:56:21.647 --> 01:56:25.692
Your wife drowned them
at the cabin by the lake.

01:56:25.776 --> 01:56:28.987
And here, the little girl,
the one you dream of ...

01:56:29.697 --> 01:56:31.364
every night.

01:56:31.448 --> 01:56:32.615
I never had a little girl.

01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:36.285
The one who tells you over and over
that you should have saved her,

01:56:36.370 --> 01:56:38.287
saved them all.

01:56:38.372 --> 01:56:40.832
Your daughter, her name was Rachel.

01:56:40.916 --> 01:56:43.793
Are you going to deny
that she ever lived?

01:56:44.545 --> 01:56:46.295
Andrew, are you?

01:57:09.278 --> 01:57:11.362
I'm so sorry, baby.

01:57:15.743 --> 01:57:18.119
I told you not to come in here.

01:57:18.579 --> 01:57:22.540
I told you this
would be the end of you.

01:57:42.895 --> 01:57:44.228
I'm back!

01:57:44.855 --> 01:57:47.607
We got him just outside of Oklahoma.

01:57:47.691 --> 01:57:50.234
Must've stopped 10 places
in between here and Tulsa.

01:57:50.319 --> 01:57:52.403
I could sleep for a week.

01:57:56.366 --> 01:58:05.917
Dolores?

01:58:10.714 --> 01:58:13.007
And he said, "Take up
your bed and walk." But God?

01:58:13.092 --> 01:58:14.133
Dolores?

01:58:14.218 --> 01:58:15.510
Then he said, "Take up
your bed and walk."

01:58:15.594 --> 01:58:17.595
Forgive sins, but God?

01:58:28.565 --> 01:58:29.941
Dolores?

01:58:55.259 --> 01:58:56.509
Baby,

01:58:58.554 --> 01:59:00.429
why are you all wet?

01:59:02.766 --> 01:59:04.308
I missed you.

01:59:11.692 --> 01:59:13.359
I wanna go home.

01:59:16.488 --> 01:59:17.989
You are home.

01:59:23.162 --> 01:59:24.996
Where are the kids?

01:59:27.624 --> 01:59:28.624
Hmm?

01:59:29.042 --> 01:59:30.793
They're in school.

01:59:34.965 --> 01:59:36.966
It's Saturday, honey.

01:59:38.135 --> 01:59:40.344
School's not in on Saturday.

01:59:42.973 --> 01:59:44.599
My school is.

01:59:57.946 --> 01:59:59.488
Oh, my God.

02:00:01.783 --> 02:00:03.242
Oh, my God!

02:00:16.381 --> 02:00:19.091
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

02:00:23.263 --> 02:00:24.847
Oh, my God, no.

02:00:28.936 --> 02:00:29.936
Come on, come on.

02:00:44.243 --> 02:00:47.370
No. No. Please, God.

02:00:49.373 --> 02:00:50.873
Please, God, no!

02:00:51.083 --> 02:00:54.126
No!

02:00:56.380 --> 02:01:07.890
No.

02:01:52.269 --> 02:01:53.477
Baby.

02:02:12.289 --> 02:02:14.790
Let's put them
at the table, Andrew.

02:02:15.625 --> 02:02:18.836
We'll dry them off.
We'll change their clothes.

02:02:21.006 --> 02:02:23.424
They'll be our living dolls. Huh?

02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:30.222
Tomorrow we can take
them on a picnic.

02:02:35.228 --> 02:02:37.188
If you ever loved me, Dolores,

02:02:38.565 --> 02:02:40.107
please stop talking.

02:02:46.323 --> 02:02:47.823
I love you.

02:02:56.541 --> 02:02:58.125
Set me free.

02:03:02.798 --> 02:03:04.215
Oh, baby.

02:03:07.677 --> 02:03:09.595
We'll give them baths.

02:03:12.849 --> 02:03:16.060
- I love you, baby.
- I love you, too.

02:03:16.144 --> 02:03:17.937
- I love you so much.
- I love you so much.

02:03:18.021 --> 02:03:19.021
I love you. I ...

02:03:42.963 --> 02:03:45.548
Oh, baby.

02:03:51.346 --> 02:03:52.680
Andrew.

02:03:54.724 --> 02:03:56.725
Andrew, can you hear me?

02:03:57.018 --> 02:04:00.896
Rachel. Rachel, Rachel.

02:04:03.150 --> 02:04:04.442
Rachel?

02:04:06.945 --> 02:04:08.404
Rachel who?

02:04:11.283 --> 02:04:13.367
Rachel. Rachel Laeddis.

02:04:14.536 --> 02:04:16.287
My daughter.

02:04:19.875 --> 02:04:21.625
Why are you here?

02:04:24.838 --> 02:04:26.380
Because I killed my wife.

02:04:26.465 --> 02:04:28.591
And why did you do that?

02:04:32.095 --> 02:04:35.264
Because she murdered our children,

02:04:38.185 --> 02:04:39.727
and she told me to let her go.

02:04:43.773 --> 02:04:46.942
- Who's Teddy Daniels?
- He doesn't exist.

02:04:49.279 --> 02:04:51.739
Neither does Rachel Solando.
I made them up.

02:04:51.823 --> 02:04:55.784
- Why?
- We need to hear you say it.

02:05:02.375 --> 02:05:05.586
After she tried to kill herself
the first time,

02:05:07.631 --> 02:05:09.590
Dolores told me she ...

02:05:10.550 --> 02:05:14.803
She had an insect living
inside her brain.

02:05:16.806 --> 02:05:21.519
She could feel it
clicking across her skull,

02:05:21.603 --> 02:05:25.814
just pulling the wires just for fun.

02:05:29.486 --> 02:05:31.278
She told me that.

02:05:32.739 --> 02:05:35.574
She told me that,
but I didn't listen.

02:05:39.287 --> 02:05:41.580
I loved her so much, you know.

02:05:42.999 --> 02:05:44.625
Why did you make them up?

02:05:47.254 --> 02:05:51.173
Because I can't take knowing
that Dolores killed our children.

02:05:55.011 --> 02:05:56.345
And I ...

02:05:58.848 --> 02:06:03.352
I killed them 'cause I didn't
get her help, you know.

02:06:07.566 --> 02:06:09.191
I killed them.

02:06:13.989 --> 02:06:15.114
Here's my fear, Andrew.

02:06:15.198 --> 02:06:18.409
We broke through once before,
nine months ago,

02:06:18.493 --> 02:06:19.493
and then you regressed.

02:06:22.038 --> 02:06:25.374
- I don't remember that.
- I know.

02:06:26.876 --> 02:06:28.669
You reset, Andrew.

02:06:29.129 --> 02:06:33.215
Like a tape playing over and over
on an endless loop.

02:06:34.467 --> 02:06:35.926
I hope that what we've done here
will be enough ...

02:06:36.011 --> 02:06:39.138
to stop it
from ever happening again,

02:06:39.222 --> 02:06:42.725
but I need to know
you've accepted reality.

02:06:49.232 --> 02:06:51.984
You came after me, huh, Doctor?

02:06:53.862 --> 02:06:57.740
You tried to help me
when no one else would.

02:07:09.544 --> 02:07:12.421
My name's Andrew Laeddis,

02:07:19.429 --> 02:07:22.890
and I murdered my wife
in the spring of '52.

02:07:47.624 --> 02:07:49.625
How we doing this morning?

02:07:50.210 --> 02:07:53.462
- Good. And you?
- Can't complain.

02:08:03.765 --> 02:08:05.349
So what's our next move?

02:08:06.643 --> 02:08:08.102
You tell me.

02:08:13.316 --> 02:08:15.150
We gotta get off this rock, Chuck.

02:08:16.319 --> 02:08:17.611
Get back to the mainland.

02:08:17.696 --> 02:08:20.656
Whatever the hell's going on here,
it's bad.

02:08:42.595 --> 02:08:45.597
Don't worry, partner,
they're not gonna catch us.

02:08:51.354 --> 02:08:54.189
That's right.
We're too smart for them.

02:08:55.316 --> 02:08:57.443
Yeah, we are, aren't we?

02:09:13.084 --> 02:09:15.836
You know,
this place makes me wonder ...

02:09:16.379 --> 02:09:18.464
Yeah, what's that, boss?

02:09:19.424 --> 02:09:21.383
Which would be worse,

02:09:22.218 --> 02:09:23.886
to live as a monster ...

02:09:36.191 --> 02:09:37.483
Teddy?
