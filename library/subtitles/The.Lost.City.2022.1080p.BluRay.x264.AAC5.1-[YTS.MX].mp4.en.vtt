WEBVTT

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:46.862
You were incredible.

00:00:47.518 --> 00:00:49.727
My heart is still racing.

00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:52.937
I felt it too.

00:00:53.041 --> 00:00:54.974
All thanks to your
brute strength, Dash,

00:00:55.077 --> 00:00:58.218
and your knowledge of ancient
Aramaic mathematics.

00:00:58.322 --> 00:01:01.221
Please. This has nothing to
do with my two doctorates

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:03.396
and my master's in Gender Studies

00:01:04.293 --> 00:01:07.262
and everything to do
with you, Dr. Lovemore.

00:01:07.711 --> 00:01:09.609
The truth is,

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:12.094
I never thought I would
find the Lost City of D.

00:01:12.198 --> 00:01:15.132
I would choose your words carefully.

00:01:15.235 --> 00:01:16.996
They will be your last.

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:20.862
You led me right to King Kalaman's tomb

00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:24.555
and his queen's
legendary Crown of Fire.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.558
And now I will be very rich,

00:01:27.662 --> 00:01:30.354
and you will be very dead.

00:01:31.286 --> 00:01:34.669
Hold up. Are these...
Are these your snakes?

00:01:34.772 --> 00:01:36.394
No, they were just here.

00:01:36.498 --> 00:01:38.949
There were just hundreds
of snakes in this temple

00:01:39.052 --> 00:01:40.916
just waiting for us to show up?

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.125
- Who feeds them? You feed them?
- No, what do they eat?

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.438
Why is that one not biting that
guy? Why is that happening?

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:47.504
Are they trained not to bite
henchmen or something?

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:48.406
Yeah, well...

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.788
I mean, the
snake-to-temple ratio alone...

00:01:50.892 --> 00:01:53.342
This is ridiculous. Delete.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.518
I... I think my character
can still work.

00:01:56.622 --> 00:01:58.347
Delete.

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.626
Loretta, you still have
a story to write.

00:02:01.316 --> 00:02:02.628
Delete.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.873
<i>Hey, it's me, Beth.</i>

00:02:06.977 --> 00:02:09.393
<i>I don't want to pull the whole
"I'm your publisher" card, but I am.</i>

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:11.844
<i>And I'm really looking forward
to seeing this last chapter.</i>

00:02:11.947 --> 00:02:13.984
<i>But no pressure. No,
there actually is pressure.</i>

00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:18.264
<i>The exact amount of pressure that
motivates you but doesn't paralyze you.</i>

00:02:18.367 --> 00:02:19.748
<i>You got this.</i>

00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.268
Thank you.

00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:24.408
<i>Me again.</i>

00:02:24.511 --> 00:02:26.375
<i>Okay, so everything
is set for the book tour,</i>

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.309
<i>but, uh, the only thing we
need is a book to tour with.</i>

00:02:29.413 --> 00:02:31.553
<i>I can't help but get the feeling
that you're not finishing</i>

00:02:31.657 --> 00:02:34.107
<i>because you don't want
to leave your house.</i>

00:02:34.211 --> 00:02:39.388
<i>Listen, I know these last five years
have been hard after John's passing,</i>

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:42.875
<i>and it feels easier to
live in your bathtub,</i>

00:02:42.978 --> 00:02:45.636
<i>drinking Chardonnay on ice.</i>

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.535
<i>But, girl, there is a great
big world waiting for you</i>

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.642
<i>and a book tour that I can't cancel,
so just make it happen, all right?</i>

00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:52.988
<i>Love you, bye!</i>

00:03:12.007 --> 00:03:13.526
We have to keep going.

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.047
Let's see what's on the
other side of that door.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.256
But what if there isn't anything?

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:22.086
There's only one way to find out.

00:03:22.984 --> 00:03:24.917
Then Lovemore realized

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.298
the treasure she
wanted was lost forever

00:03:27.402 --> 00:03:29.784
and her adventures
were coming to an end.

00:03:29.887 --> 00:03:31.026
That doesn't feel right.

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:32.925
Yeah, but that's it.

00:03:33.028 --> 00:03:34.478
That's the end.

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:45.075
Well, John,

00:03:45.661 --> 00:03:46.766
here I go.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.148
Dulcius ex asperis.

00:03:55.671 --> 00:03:58.433
- Okay, honey, it's showtime.
- Are you sure about this?

00:03:58.536 --> 00:04:02.126
Because I have a wedgie in the
back and in the front in this thing.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.473
I feel like a nerdy figure skater.

00:04:04.577 --> 00:04:07.269
- Sexy. Stunner. I'm all about it.
- No, it's not. It's not.

00:04:07.373 --> 00:04:09.306
- How do I move in this?
- Don't touch it.

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.618
- I'm not touching it. I'm holding it out.
- Stop it. Will you stop?

00:04:11.722 --> 00:04:13.897
Get it out now 'cause
you can't do that onstage.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.692
And we're done. And
we're done. Okay, good.

00:04:16.796 --> 00:04:18.694
Do I need to be wearing
a glitter onesie?

00:04:18.798 --> 00:04:20.248
You only have to wear
this for two hours.

00:04:20.351 --> 00:04:22.319
Do not mess this up, do you
hear me? This is on loan.

00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:24.424
Everyone's wearing sequins right now.

00:04:25.943 --> 00:04:28.014
- Why is she taking my photo?
- This is Allison.

00:04:28.118 --> 00:04:30.430
She is our new social media manager.

00:04:30.534 --> 00:04:33.364
And she's gonna be helping us
target that younger demographic.

00:04:33.468 --> 00:04:35.953
Meaning women in their 30s
who wish they were in their 20s.

00:04:36.057 --> 00:04:37.575
Hey, what's up?

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:41.027
Um, I took over your socials,
so this morning you tweeted,

00:04:41.131 --> 00:04:46.308
"Where are my ladies at? Meet
me at Ballroom G at 5:00 p.m.

00:04:46.412 --> 00:04:47.862


00:04:47.965 --> 00:04:50.830


00:04:50.934 --> 00:04:53.488
Okay, we are having fun. Let's go.

00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:56.560
We need to remind people
that you are still alive.

00:04:56.663 --> 00:04:58.079
People know I'm alive.

00:04:58.182 --> 00:05:00.150
And to remind them why this used to be

00:05:00.253 --> 00:05:02.324
- the best selling franchise.
- In Romance.

00:05:02.428 --> 00:05:05.051
Yes, which is the top
revenue-generating literary category.

00:05:05.155 --> 00:05:08.020
Revenue-generating isn't how I would
describe our presales right now.

00:05:08.123 --> 00:05:10.263
Just think of this as a way
that uses word of mouth.

00:05:10.367 --> 00:05:11.989
Oh, you want word of mouth?
Here we go. How's this?

00:05:12.093 --> 00:05:14.889
"The only thing more lost than
the city is the author herself."

00:05:14.992 --> 00:05:16.752
"Loveless." "Passionless."

00:05:16.856 --> 00:05:20.756
Uh, "Way past her prime." And, oh,
"This is fake history at its worst."

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.035
A book tour could
change everything, okay?

00:05:23.138 --> 00:05:25.451
We have to remind the fans
why they love you so much.

00:05:25.554 --> 00:05:29.144
Real history. I merely season
it with a smidge more nudity.

00:05:29.248 --> 00:05:31.457
History had a ton of nudity.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.391
<i>Deep exploration.</i>

00:05:34.494 --> 00:05:36.980
<i>Steamy wondering.</i>

00:05:37.083 --> 00:05:42.123
<i>Will Lovemore and Dash find Queen
Taha's priceless Crown of Fire?</i>

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:44.021
<i>Join them on their search.</i>

00:05:44.125 --> 00:05:46.058
So, listen, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:47.404
There's so many people.

00:05:47.507 --> 00:05:49.647
I know how much you
hate doing these things,

00:05:49.751 --> 00:05:52.478
so I've invited Alan to do
the Q and A with you today.

00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:54.583
- What?
- And the rest of the book tour.

00:05:54.687 --> 00:05:57.655
Beth, I expressly asked not to do any
more events with Dash... Alan, Alan!

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:00.589
- He's gonna humiliate me.
- He's not gonna humiliate you.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:03.730
Thank you. You're very good at your
job. Thank you so much. Thank you.

00:06:03.834 --> 00:06:05.042
Let me help you with that.

00:06:05.146 --> 00:06:07.044
He is... He's a body wash commercial.

00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:09.012
He's always glistening
all over the place.

00:06:09.115 --> 00:06:12.015
There hasn't been an event
where his shirt didn't come flying off.

00:06:12.118 --> 00:06:13.637
- You wish.
- Well, he's already here,

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.881
so put on your big-girl panties
and let's get out there.

00:06:15.984 --> 00:06:19.160
Remember, no grumpy face, big
words or boring academic talk.

00:06:19.263 --> 00:06:22.542
Yes! Yes!

00:06:22.646 --> 00:06:24.579
Come on, RTP!

00:06:24.682 --> 00:06:26.167
Ha-ha!

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.514
Yes, my Lovemore-heads!

00:06:28.617 --> 00:06:32.069
I am so excited to introduce to you

00:06:32.173 --> 00:06:36.004
the award-winning author, Loretta Sage!

00:06:36.108 --> 00:06:38.662
- Beth, I can't do this. I'm not ready.
- Are you kidding me?

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.491
Listen, I've got your
back. You got this.

00:06:40.595 --> 00:06:42.114
Go give the people what they want.

00:06:42.217 --> 00:06:44.081
- It's not me they want.
- Get out there now!

00:06:46.635 --> 00:06:50.467
Hi. How are you? Nice
to see you. Thank you.

00:06:55.817 --> 00:06:57.543
Yep. Mount it.

00:06:59.994 --> 00:07:02.893
Mount it. Mount it. Okay.

00:07:02.997 --> 00:07:04.688
Find your center.

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:08.347
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.211
The sexiest...

00:07:10.314 --> 00:07:14.318
...most influential
hero of a generation.

00:07:14.422 --> 00:07:15.630
That's a bit strong.

00:07:15.733 --> 00:07:18.357
His 20th cover of an
Angela Lovemore novel.

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:21.084
Dash McMahon!

00:07:26.537 --> 00:07:29.057
Oh, my God! Dash!

00:07:51.735 --> 00:07:54.082
- Take a bow.
- I already did mine. I did mine.

00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:57.154
Okay, come on. One more. I got you.

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:13.826
Did you guys rehearse that? Oh, my God.

00:08:13.929 --> 00:08:17.761
I'm loving this chemistry
between you two, and I got to say,

00:08:17.864 --> 00:08:20.005
I love this book.

00:08:20.108 --> 00:08:21.178
- Oh, thank you, Ray.
- Thank...

00:08:21.282 --> 00:08:22.628
Spoiler alert.

00:08:22.731 --> 00:08:24.009
A really bold choice

00:08:24.112 --> 00:08:26.045
to not have them go
into the tomb at the end.

00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:27.771
Talk about what went into this one.

00:08:27.874 --> 00:08:31.326
I mean, this one's such a
special book for me personally.

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.260
I... I don't know how to say
how much it means to me

00:08:34.364 --> 00:08:36.469
that Loretta, word
writer extraordinaire,

00:08:36.573 --> 00:08:39.610
has, you know, named the book after me.

00:08:39.714 --> 00:08:41.543
The Lost City of Dash.

00:08:41.647 --> 00:08:42.751
The Lost City of D.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.099
Um, but that's not
what the D stands for.

00:08:45.202 --> 00:08:47.791
- It's D for "dick," right?
- No dick, no.

00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:51.001
It's based on the name of an ancient
tribe, Dapocagihou-dysphem-ica.

00:08:51.105 --> 00:08:55.661
And, um, it was too difficult for the
European colonizers to pronounce,

00:08:55.764 --> 00:08:59.044
- so, in true colonial fashion they abbreviated it.
- No one cares about this.

00:08:59.147 --> 00:09:00.873
That's so interesting. Okay.

00:09:00.976 --> 00:09:03.289
How about we take some
questions from the audience?

00:09:03.393 --> 00:09:05.188
Yes.

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:09.433
Dash, what's your
favorite romantic moment?

00:09:09.537 --> 00:09:14.059
What I would really like to know is what
is Loretta's favorite romantic moment?

00:09:14.162 --> 00:09:16.095
Ooh, spicy.

00:09:16.199 --> 00:09:18.132
Oh, uh...

00:09:18.235 --> 00:09:20.927
Well, being a sapiosexual...

00:09:21.031 --> 00:09:23.240
Oh, is that when they do
the snakes around the...

00:09:23.344 --> 00:09:27.417
No. That's someone
who finds, uh, intellect

00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:31.421
or intelligence, uh,
very sexy, you know.

00:09:31.524 --> 00:09:32.629
Same.

00:09:33.112 --> 00:09:34.355
Really?

00:09:34.458 --> 00:09:36.874
Dash! Rip off your shirt!

00:09:36.978 --> 00:09:40.706
No, no, no. We're not gonna do that
today. We're here for Loretta's book.

00:09:40.809 --> 00:09:42.673
Do we have questions for Loretta?

00:09:42.777 --> 00:09:47.954
Uh, yes, studious-looking young
lady? What would you like to ask me?

00:09:48.058 --> 00:09:50.095
Can you rip off Dash's shirt?

00:09:51.648 --> 00:09:54.478
No, no. We're not gonna
do this again. Sorry.

00:09:54.582 --> 00:09:57.102
Rip it off! Rip it off!

00:09:57.205 --> 00:09:59.518
Rip it off! Rip it off! Rip it off!

00:09:59.621 --> 00:10:03.349
Of course. Of course, yes. Can do.

00:10:04.316 --> 00:10:05.593
Is this happening?

00:10:05.696 --> 00:10:07.422
- You don't have to do this.
- Oh, we have to.

00:10:07.526 --> 00:10:09.597
We have to give the people
what they want. Yes, yes.

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:12.427
We have to give the people
what they want, yes.

00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:15.775
Ladies and gentlemen, enjoy.

00:10:15.879 --> 00:10:20.539
Because The Lost City of
D is Dash's final adventure.

00:10:20.642 --> 00:10:22.713
If there even is a next book,

00:10:22.817 --> 00:10:25.923
it will open with Lovemore
receiving the tragic news

00:10:26.027 --> 00:10:28.374
of his untimely death.

00:10:28.478 --> 00:10:29.858
What?

00:10:29.962 --> 00:10:31.412
Shit. I'm sorry. My smartwatch
is stuck.Ow. Hold on.

00:10:31.515 --> 00:10:32.585
I know. Don't pull it.

00:10:32.689 --> 00:10:34.208
It's okay. Just be real still.

00:10:34.311 --> 00:10:35.726
- No. That's pulling it.
- You're pulling it.

00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.419
You're gonna rip my
wig off. No, you can't...

00:10:42.837 --> 00:10:43.803
Oh, my!

00:10:43.907 --> 00:10:45.322
- Oh, my God.
- Is he okay?

00:10:45.426 --> 00:10:47.048
God, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

00:10:47.152 --> 00:10:49.809
- I'm so sorry.
- You're a bad person.

00:10:49.913 --> 00:10:54.159
Stick around for the costume
contest at 6:00 p.m.

00:10:55.021 --> 00:10:57.265
"If there is another book"?

00:10:57.369 --> 00:11:02.270
I'm investing everything
we've got into this tour, okay?

00:11:02.374 --> 00:11:05.825
I just don't think I have another
Dash and Lovemore adventure in me.

00:11:05.929 --> 00:11:07.310
How does Dash die?

00:11:07.413 --> 00:11:09.553
- Was it the snakes?
- No.

00:11:09.657 --> 00:11:12.004
Okay, so I have something
that I have to take care of.

00:11:12.107 --> 00:11:14.558
You guys have an interview
in the next suite in ten minutes.

00:11:14.662 --> 00:11:17.078
So can you please do me
a favor and be grown-ups

00:11:17.182 --> 00:11:18.700
and get yourselves there on your own?

00:11:18.804 --> 00:11:20.012
Okay. Thank you so much.

00:11:20.806 --> 00:11:22.877
Does he die from a staph infection?

00:11:24.844 --> 00:11:26.915
It is a staph infection. I knew it.

00:11:28.089 --> 00:11:29.470
I-I... All right.

00:11:29.573 --> 00:11:32.645
Look, I get it if you need
a break or something,

00:11:32.749 --> 00:11:34.751
- but you can't just kill me, okay?
- Okay.

00:11:34.854 --> 00:11:39.238
I hate that I have to ask this, but
you do know you're not Dash, right?

00:11:39.342 --> 00:11:41.516
Dash is a character I made up.

00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:42.862
Dash?

00:11:45.693 --> 00:11:46.935
Thanks.

00:11:47.039 --> 00:11:48.247
Thank you.

00:11:50.732 --> 00:11:53.010
- Loretta, it's this way.
- No, I think it's this way.

00:11:53.114 --> 00:11:55.461
Can't you see that Dash
means so much to people?

00:11:55.565 --> 00:11:57.429
- Means so much to you.
- Not to me.

00:11:57.532 --> 00:11:59.189
Well, yeah, to me, but
to other people too.

00:11:59.293 --> 00:12:02.261
- What about Beth?
- You know what? Beth is gonna be fine.

00:12:02.365 --> 00:12:06.196
She's gonna find plenty fresh,
young writers full of great ideas.

00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.302
You can transition gracefully

00:12:08.405 --> 00:12:10.752
into the shirt-on phase
of your modeling career,

00:12:10.856 --> 00:12:12.202
and I can be left alone.

00:12:12.306 --> 00:12:14.031
Everybody is happy.

00:12:14.135 --> 00:12:15.930
No, it's this way.

00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:17.863
Beth says you don't even
leave the house anymore.

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:20.003
I don't feel like that's very happy.

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:23.006
You should be going out in the world,
filling yourself up on new experiences.

00:12:23.109 --> 00:12:25.353
I'm already filled up.
I'm full. I'm fully satiated.

00:12:25.457 --> 00:12:28.805
Why would you want to be stuck at home
alone when you could see the world?

00:12:28.908 --> 00:12:30.427
You could be visiting ancient Greece.

00:12:30.531 --> 00:12:33.430
Okay. How could I visit ancient Greece?

00:12:33.534 --> 00:12:35.570
I get it. Because
you're afraid of flying.

00:12:35.674 --> 00:12:39.091
No. Because ancient
Greece is in the past.

00:12:39.194 --> 00:12:40.748
Just like Dash.

00:12:40.851 --> 00:12:44.061
Okay. You want to know who
else is stuck in the past? You are.

00:12:44.165 --> 00:12:46.926
You're so afraid of life hurting
you again that you've stopped living.

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:49.343
You're like a human mummy.

00:12:50.827 --> 00:12:52.863
I didn't, um...

00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:55.314
Oh.

00:12:55.418 --> 00:12:57.558
Mummies are human.

00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:08.810
Stupid... Oh, crap.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.848
I'm so sorry. I-I will clean this up.

00:13:11.951 --> 00:13:14.437
I am not a litterer,
I-I assure you that.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.026
Do you, um... Do you think you
could, uh, call a car for me, please?

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.649
Thank you. Thank you.

00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:23.584
Bring the car around.

00:13:23.687 --> 00:13:25.137
God, is that someone's retainer?

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.588
I've never said the right
thing one time around her.

00:13:27.691 --> 00:13:29.624
I get nervous because
she opens her mouth,

00:13:29.728 --> 00:13:34.180
and just an encyclopedia of beautifulness
comes out, and I just never say...

00:13:34.284 --> 00:13:35.596
You know she's trying to kill me?

00:13:35.699 --> 00:13:37.874
I just need those tomatoes.

00:13:37.977 --> 00:13:40.325
You're right. No, you're right.

00:13:40.428 --> 00:13:41.912
I should apologize. Thank you, man.

00:13:42.016 --> 00:13:44.259
- I appreciate that very, very much.
- You're welcome.

00:13:54.408 --> 00:13:56.686
Uh, Loretta Sage. Yeah.

00:14:01.898 --> 00:14:03.002
Uh...

00:14:04.314 --> 00:14:05.522
Hiya.

00:14:05.626 --> 00:14:07.110
Uh, I did not order an UberPool.

00:14:07.213 --> 00:14:10.182
Someone wants to meet you.
We'll have you right back.

00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:11.459
Um...

00:14:14.945 --> 00:14:16.222
Loretta!

00:14:16.326 --> 00:14:17.845
Loretta! Loretta?

00:14:20.744 --> 00:14:22.608
Uh, Loretta?

00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:25.300
- Did you say "Loretta"?
- Yeah.

00:14:25.404 --> 00:14:26.612
- Follow that SUV, man.
- No.

00:14:26.716 --> 00:14:28.476
- Come on, please!
- No, no, no.

00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.652
I'm not helping any more handsome
strangers. Fool me once. Mm-mmm.

00:14:31.755 --> 00:14:35.069
What is this, Taken? Am I "tooken"?

00:14:35.172 --> 00:14:36.588
Am I sold already?

00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:39.694
Am I... Am I sold to him?

00:14:39.798 --> 00:14:43.457
- Ow. Stop.
- Oh, no. Did this feel creepy?

00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.183
I said don't make it creepy, guys.

00:14:46.287 --> 00:14:48.116
I'm so sorry about the setting.

00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:50.809
I just flew in. I was in a
real panic to meet you.

00:14:50.912 --> 00:14:52.983
I didn't have time to
dress the place up much.

00:14:53.087 --> 00:14:55.883
I read you love cheese,
so I just got them all.

00:14:55.986 --> 00:15:00.059
Are you the one who's been
emailing me for photos of my feet?

00:15:00.163 --> 00:15:02.027
No. Um...

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.445
And I promise what I'm about to show
you is gonna make you very happy.

00:15:07.204 --> 00:15:08.413
But first, a little bit

00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:11.726
about the mysterious
rogue you see before you.

00:15:11.830 --> 00:15:14.108
Uh, my name is Abigail Fairfax.

00:15:14.211 --> 00:15:17.145
- Abigail?
- It's a gender-neutral name, like Leslie or Beverly.

00:15:17.249 --> 00:15:20.942
Yes, but you're Abigail Fairfax
of the media-mogul Fairfaxes?

00:15:21.874 --> 00:15:25.084
Didn't you just take
over your company or...

00:15:25.188 --> 00:15:29.123
No, that was my brother, actually.
That was Leslie. We're all very proud.

00:15:29.226 --> 00:15:32.333
Ah. Yes, I should say so,
at such a young age to...

00:15:32.437 --> 00:15:34.369
Some might even say too young.

00:15:34.473 --> 00:15:37.200
But that world never
really interested me.

00:15:37.303 --> 00:15:39.892
My passions, as you may know,

00:15:39.996 --> 00:15:43.102
lie in the hidden things in the world,

00:15:43.206 --> 00:15:45.829
things which defy possession.

00:15:45.933 --> 00:15:48.970
Um, some might call me a collector.

00:15:49.074 --> 00:15:52.767
But there is one
obsession in particular

00:15:52.871 --> 00:15:54.976
that has held me captive.

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:57.634
The Crown of Fire

00:15:57.738 --> 00:16:00.119
and its cascading red diamonds.

00:16:00.223 --> 00:16:03.882
Is this a... Is this a
hidden-camera thing?

00:16:03.985 --> 00:16:07.575
So imagine my surprise
when, in your new book,

00:16:07.679 --> 00:16:10.958
amidst the pages of coital reverie,

00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:11.890
was something...

00:16:11.993 --> 00:16:14.064
- Oh, God...
- quite magnificent.

00:16:15.928 --> 00:16:18.483
I get it. I get it. I
so get it right now.

00:16:18.586 --> 00:16:19.898
Oh, my gosh.

00:16:20.001 --> 00:16:22.176
I literally thought you
guys kidnapped me.

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:24.765
I mean, this is marketing,
right? Beth set this up?

00:16:24.868 --> 00:16:27.768
This was so good, you
guys. This was amazing.

00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:31.116
You, with your gun and your mustache

00:16:31.219 --> 00:16:34.188
and your, "You'd better get
in there" and you know...

00:16:35.396 --> 00:16:36.915
Oh, my God.

00:16:37.018 --> 00:16:40.781
You, with the G.I. Joe
tone-on-tone outfit.

00:16:40.884 --> 00:16:45.889
Your fictional archaeologist was making
real translations of a dead language.

00:16:45.993 --> 00:16:48.892
- Mm-hmm.
- Something nobody else has been able to do.

00:16:48.996 --> 00:16:51.412
Well, nobody else had ever tried.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:53.345
Is that right? Am I
saying the right thing?

00:16:53.448 --> 00:16:55.105
Except you, right?

00:16:55.209 --> 00:16:57.176
Except me!

00:16:57.280 --> 00:16:59.006
Yes. See, it turns out

00:16:59.109 --> 00:17:02.423
Loretta Sage was once a young
college girl doing her dissertation

00:17:02.527 --> 00:17:05.391
on the dead language of
the D with her future husband,

00:17:05.495 --> 00:17:08.602
dreaming of finding Kalaman's
tomb and the Crown of Fire.

00:17:08.705 --> 00:17:11.812
I was sorry to read you gave
up your search after he died.

00:17:11.915 --> 00:17:13.538
But what that means is,

00:17:14.815 --> 00:17:16.713
you're all I have left.

00:17:16.817 --> 00:17:19.992
All-All you have left for... what?

00:17:20.096 --> 00:17:21.131
Hmm.

00:17:22.926 --> 00:17:24.169
Oh.

00:17:24.272 --> 00:17:25.653
Here we go.

00:17:39.771 --> 00:17:41.496
What is this?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:45.293
I believe it is describing the
exact location of Kalaman's tomb,

00:17:45.397 --> 00:17:48.849
in which Taha and her
priceless headdress are buried.

00:17:48.952 --> 00:17:51.092
Well, if this were authentic,

00:17:51.196 --> 00:17:56.546
you would still have
to uncover an entire city

00:17:56.650 --> 00:17:59.687
that nobody has been able to find.

00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:01.447
I found it.

00:18:01.551 --> 00:18:04.692
On a tiny, forgotten island in
the Atlantic called Isla Hundida.

00:18:04.796 --> 00:18:08.351
What I have not been able to
find is Kalaman's final resting place.

00:18:08.454 --> 00:18:12.735
This piece of parchment is the
only clue we found among the ruins.

00:18:12.838 --> 00:18:15.979
I need someone who can
decipher these symbols.

00:18:16.601 --> 00:18:18.154
I need you.

00:18:19.293 --> 00:18:20.743
- Well...
- Miss Sage,

00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:24.229
surely this isn't how you
want your story to end.

00:18:24.332 --> 00:18:26.921
We both had our dreams
crushed by bad luck,

00:18:27.025 --> 00:18:29.268
or in my case, an
arse-kissing little brother,

00:18:29.372 --> 00:18:32.478
but this is our chance
to show them all.

00:18:32.582 --> 00:18:34.170
Come with me... to the island.

00:18:34.273 --> 00:18:39.416
Translate these symbols and
help me find the Crown of Fire.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.143
You can name your price.

00:18:44.767 --> 00:18:47.597
I must respectfully decline.

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:53.672
Well...

00:18:55.294 --> 00:18:57.262
I can't say I'm not disappointed.

00:18:58.159 --> 00:19:00.645
But I understand how you feel.

00:19:03.993 --> 00:19:05.753
Will you at least let
us give you a ride?

00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:10.137
Oh, no, thank you. I'll call
for my own car, and I'll just...

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:35.472
I don't feel like you're listening
to me. This is urgent, and we...

00:19:35.576 --> 00:19:38.510
Okay, so the police are saying
that they put out an APB...

00:19:38.613 --> 00:19:40.270
- APB...
- on an SUV,

00:19:40.374 --> 00:19:42.617
- and there's this 24-hour rule...
- Why is there a rule?

00:19:42.721 --> 00:19:45.137
- ...and they won't do anything until...
- What about the FBI or the CIA?

00:19:45.241 --> 00:19:47.208
- They said to call the police.
- I'm sure Loretta's fine.

00:19:47.312 --> 00:19:49.901
When I was in college, my
friend Nicki went missing.

00:19:50.004 --> 00:19:51.626
Everyone was, like, freaking out.

00:19:51.730 --> 00:19:54.077
But then she was just in her car.

00:19:54.181 --> 00:19:57.356
She was dead, but we
found her. She wasn't gone.

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:01.809
Um, what about...
Maybe we could get a PI

00:20:01.913 --> 00:20:04.432
or, like, you know,
private security or...

00:20:04.536 --> 00:20:06.434
What about an extraction
team, like the movie?

00:20:06.538 --> 00:20:09.023
Yes! But who does that?
The ex-military, right?

00:20:09.127 --> 00:20:11.716
Oh, yeah. I think I actually have
somebody that could help us.

00:20:11.819 --> 00:20:14.788
- Oh.
- I did this meditation retreat,

00:20:14.891 --> 00:20:16.962
and there was this trainer guy there.

00:20:17.066 --> 00:20:18.584
You should see this guy meditate.

00:20:18.688 --> 00:20:20.103
But he's ex-Navy SEAL.

00:20:20.207 --> 00:20:24.004
He... He's a special ops
trainer. What was his name?

00:20:24.694 --> 00:20:25.833
Yeah. Jack Trainer.

00:20:25.937 --> 00:20:27.559
So he's a trainer named Jack Trainer?

00:20:27.662 --> 00:20:29.837
That's how I have everybody in
my phone. See, "Janice Mom."

00:20:29.941 --> 00:20:31.390
"Larry Doorknob." "Stacy Butt Stuff."

00:20:31.494 --> 00:20:34.186
Look, this is what this
guy does. He finds people.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:36.568
If there's anybody that
can help us, it's him.

00:20:43.506 --> 00:20:46.026
- <i>Jack Trainer.</i>
- Oh, so his name is actually Jack Trainer.

00:20:46.129 --> 00:20:50.030
Hi, uh, this is Alan from
"Touching Your Inner Self."

00:20:51.514 --> 00:20:53.343
The meditation retreat?

00:20:55.069 --> 00:20:58.141
Anyway, uh, okay. Our friend
Loretta has been kidnapped,

00:20:58.245 --> 00:20:59.694
and no one's helping us.

00:20:59.798 --> 00:21:01.282
<i>How long she been missing?</i>

00:21:01.386 --> 00:21:02.628
Maybe two hours now.

00:21:02.732 --> 00:21:04.044
<i>Who is that?</i>

00:21:04.147 --> 00:21:08.186
Um, this is B... This
is Beth. I'm Beth.

00:21:08.289 --> 00:21:10.705
And Allison is on too, sir.

00:21:10.809 --> 00:21:13.018
<i>Did she have any Wi-Fi-enabled devices?</i>

00:21:13.122 --> 00:21:16.021
- She's got her phone, right?
- No, I have her phone.

00:21:16.125 --> 00:21:18.748
Oh! She has a smartwatch.
It ripped my wig off.

00:21:18.852 --> 00:21:21.786
<i>What was that scenario?
Never mind. Open the phone.</i>

00:21:21.889 --> 00:21:23.442
- <i>Go to the smartwatch app.</i>
- All right.

00:21:23.546 --> 00:21:25.859
<i>Then hit "Find My Smartwatch."</i>

00:21:25.962 --> 00:21:28.896
Oh, my... That is so good.
That's why we called.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.450
<i>"Anticipate the difficult
by managing the easy."</i>

00:21:31.554 --> 00:21:35.247
- Is that Oprah or Deepak?
<i>- Laozi fromTao-te Ching.</i>

00:21:35.351 --> 00:21:36.559
Oh, my God.

00:21:36.662 --> 00:21:38.354
It's in the Atlantic.

00:21:38.457 --> 00:21:40.805
- She's on a plane?
- How can you tell that?

00:21:40.908 --> 00:21:43.083
'Cause she can't swim that fast.

00:21:43.186 --> 00:21:44.636
<i>Doesn't sound like a ransom scenario.</i>

00:21:44.739 --> 00:21:47.363
<i>My guess is blood sport,
Hunger Games type situation.</i>

00:21:47.466 --> 00:21:50.297
<i>Possibly some coke-fueled
dark web scavenger hunt.</i>

00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:52.437
<i>Real clown shit. We'll
have to move fast.</i>

00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:55.474
- How do we pay you?
- <i>Cryptocurrency. Cash App.</i>

00:21:55.578 --> 00:21:59.064
<i>I'll have her back within 48 hours
or your next rescue is free.</i>

00:21:59.168 --> 00:22:00.652
How many people need a next rescue?

00:22:00.755 --> 00:22:02.274
More than you'd think.

00:22:02.378 --> 00:22:04.207
<i>- I'm gonna need that phone.</i>
- I'll bring it to you.

00:22:04.311 --> 00:22:07.072
<i>Let me know where she lands.
I'll meet you there, Alan.</i>

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.123
Hello.

00:22:27.713 --> 00:22:28.853
Where am I?

00:22:28.956 --> 00:22:30.958
Um, you're on my plane.

00:22:31.062 --> 00:22:32.270
It's nice, isn't it? Hmm?

00:22:32.373 --> 00:22:34.203
The seats are made
of mama llama leather.

00:22:34.306 --> 00:22:37.413
Well, I'm getting off your plane.

00:22:37.516 --> 00:22:38.897
Unchain me!

00:22:39.001 --> 00:22:40.554
That's your seat belt.

00:22:41.141 --> 00:22:43.005
Did you chloroform me?

00:22:43.108 --> 00:22:45.317
People actually do that?

00:22:47.699 --> 00:22:50.357
Well, you know, it's
a classic for a reason.

00:22:51.047 --> 00:22:52.290
My body feels drunk.

00:22:52.393 --> 00:22:54.292
It'll wear off in a bit. I am sorry.

00:22:54.395 --> 00:22:56.811
I just couldn't wait around
for you to change your mind.

00:22:56.915 --> 00:22:59.366
- Stop playing jelly.
- Time is not on our side.

00:22:59.469 --> 00:23:02.196
You see, the volcano
we're excavating around

00:23:02.300 --> 00:23:04.267
has developed a bad
case of indigestion.

00:23:04.371 --> 00:23:06.235
I'm rather worried that when it blows,

00:23:06.338 --> 00:23:08.409
everything that's left of the
Lost City will be destroyed.

00:23:08.513 --> 00:23:10.411
Oh, my God. My legs don't work.

00:23:10.515 --> 00:23:15.934
So, this is our last chance to
find both the tomb and the crown.

00:23:16.038 --> 00:23:18.074
Oh, God. Oh!

00:23:18.178 --> 00:23:20.456
Don't worry. That's
just our final descent.

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:26.565
But it is the beginning of the
greatest adventure of your life.

00:24:35.186 --> 00:24:37.257
Welcome to the Lost City.

00:24:46.887 --> 00:24:48.302
How did you find it?

00:24:48.406 --> 00:24:50.546
So, the city was built on a lava dome.

00:24:50.649 --> 00:24:53.342
As the volcano became active,
the dome filled with lava,

00:24:53.445 --> 00:24:56.069
and sunken things rose to the surface.

00:24:56.172 --> 00:24:58.071
The D exposed itself.

00:24:58.174 --> 00:25:01.212
- The entire city?
- No, no. Just the tip.

00:25:01.315 --> 00:25:04.525
As soon as I heard rumors of the ruins,
I flew over and bought the place.

00:25:04.629 --> 00:25:07.908
- The site?
- No. The island. The southern half.

00:25:08.012 --> 00:25:10.359
I got a good deal 'cause
this is where the lava flows.

00:25:10.462 --> 00:25:12.706
We've been excavating for a year now.

00:25:13.776 --> 00:25:16.330
One doesn't kidnap a
romance novelist on day one.

00:25:16.434 --> 00:25:18.470
Ah, yes, as the saying goes.

00:25:18.574 --> 00:25:21.577
Rafi doesn't like it. Do you, Rafi?

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:24.856
He says we're
disrespecting his heritage.

00:25:24.959 --> 00:25:28.204
But not a lot of other job options
on the island, are there, Rafi?

00:25:28.308 --> 00:25:30.379
Beggars can't be choosers.

00:25:40.216 --> 00:25:42.046
No more charcuterie, I take it.

00:25:42.149 --> 00:25:44.255
Mmm. Please. I'm not a monster.

00:25:44.358 --> 00:25:46.188
Whatever you need, just shout.

00:25:47.706 --> 00:25:52.573
Uh, leave one hand free.
She has some translating to do.

00:25:53.781 --> 00:25:55.024
And then what?

00:25:55.128 --> 00:25:57.647
Loretta, I really wish
you would try and see

00:25:57.751 --> 00:25:59.891
what an exciting
opportunity this is for us.

00:25:59.994 --> 00:26:03.895
I believe this text describes
the exact location of the tomb.

00:26:03.998 --> 00:26:06.518
It's a logographic system.

00:26:07.278 --> 00:26:09.866
Like cuneiform or hieroglyphics.

00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:13.767
Now, if you have other documents
that possibly I can compare...

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.148
Yeah, no luck there.

00:26:15.251 --> 00:26:18.047
We found some scratching
at a nearby waterfall,

00:26:18.151 --> 00:26:19.048
but it was useless.

00:26:19.152 --> 00:26:20.705
Just pictures of women.

00:26:20.808 --> 00:26:25.399
Look, I, too, wish your dear
old dead archaeologist husband

00:26:25.503 --> 00:26:28.230
was here to help, but he's not, so,

00:26:28.333 --> 00:26:31.440
time to shine, Loretta,
sex-book writer.

00:26:32.855 --> 00:26:34.581
They will come for me.

00:26:35.168 --> 00:26:36.893
Who, exactly?

00:26:36.997 --> 00:26:38.723
Your... Your many cats?

00:26:38.826 --> 00:26:40.621
Oh, I don't have cats.

00:26:41.208 --> 00:26:43.037
Somehow even more sad.

00:26:43.141 --> 00:26:46.110
I have a hamster, asshole!

00:26:46.213 --> 00:26:47.870
You have a hamster's asshole?

00:26:47.973 --> 00:26:51.736
No, there was a... there was
a comma between... Forget it.

00:26:51.839 --> 00:26:55.257
I bet your brother never
had to kidnap anyone!

00:27:45.997 --> 00:27:47.585
Good to see you, man.

00:27:47.688 --> 00:27:49.311
- Phone.
- Right.

00:28:01.185 --> 00:28:02.427
What?

00:28:02.531 --> 00:28:05.119
Yeah, I was thinking
that I could, you know,

00:28:05.223 --> 00:28:06.811
maybe just sort of come with you.

00:28:06.914 --> 00:28:08.675
- Why?
- To help.

00:28:08.778 --> 00:28:12.920
I know CPR. I know some
light karate. CrossFit certified.

00:28:13.024 --> 00:28:14.543
Okay, okay, listen, listen!

00:28:15.406 --> 00:28:17.097
I just... It's my fault.

00:28:17.201 --> 00:28:19.306
Not the kidnapping and stuff,

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:22.482
but, like, I said some really
mean stuff to her, and I regret it,

00:28:22.585 --> 00:28:24.208
and I just need to take it back.

00:28:24.311 --> 00:28:25.692
I called her a human mummy.

00:28:27.038 --> 00:28:28.453
Mummies are human.

00:28:29.109 --> 00:28:31.525
I'm aware of that now, yes.

00:28:31.629 --> 00:28:34.666
That is true.

00:28:34.770 --> 00:28:35.771
Please.

00:28:37.048 --> 00:28:39.740
All right, Alan, I can't
be responsible for you.

00:28:40.707 --> 00:28:41.708
Okay. Yeah.

00:28:41.811 --> 00:28:44.780
- I need you to stay in the car.
- Yeah.

00:28:44.883 --> 00:28:46.989
- In the car.
- In the car.

00:28:47.092 --> 00:28:49.543
- The whole time.
- The whole time?

00:28:49.647 --> 00:28:50.889
Whole time.

00:28:50.993 --> 00:28:52.236
Mm-hmm.

00:28:53.996 --> 00:28:55.273
Yes!

00:29:02.211 --> 00:29:03.557
This is me.

00:29:04.455 --> 00:29:06.733
Really? Is this what
the SEAL teams use?

00:29:06.836 --> 00:29:09.494
"Only a fool chooses
a horse by its color."

00:29:09.598 --> 00:29:12.394
Right, right. The Tao-te Ching?

00:29:12.497 --> 00:29:15.638
No, it was on the sign back
there at the rental place.

00:29:24.164 --> 00:29:25.372
Thank you.

00:29:58.198 --> 00:29:59.648
What? What?

00:30:01.891 --> 00:30:03.893
I was hoping to
invite you to breakfast,

00:30:03.997 --> 00:30:06.655
but it looks like you
still have work to do.

00:30:07.621 --> 00:30:09.382
Uh, wait, wait, wait.

00:30:09.485 --> 00:30:11.004
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

00:30:11.107 --> 00:30:13.109
I believe this says

00:30:13.213 --> 00:30:15.215
"rest" or "resting."

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:18.218
So it would be, "Kalaman
and his treasure..."

00:30:18.322 --> 00:30:22.809
And then there are some missing
pieces, and then "rest," "resting,"

00:30:22.912 --> 00:30:26.330
and something about "tears," so...

00:30:28.124 --> 00:30:29.125
Resting where?

00:30:29.229 --> 00:30:30.437
Hmm? Oh!

00:30:30.541 --> 00:30:33.302
Didn't say. It doesn't say.

00:30:34.648 --> 00:30:37.651
Miss Sage, I need you to do better.

00:30:37.755 --> 00:30:41.206
Then next time maybe don't
kidnap a romance novelist, hmm?

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:43.519
My God, this shouldn't be this hard!

00:30:43.623 --> 00:30:45.556
It is not some pauper's
grave we're looking for.

00:30:45.659 --> 00:30:47.937
It is a monument to a great man!

00:30:48.041 --> 00:30:49.974
King Kalaman was
ambitious, he was powerful,

00:30:50.077 --> 00:30:52.528
he was the first man to
build a city in the Atlantic.

00:30:52.632 --> 00:30:55.289
The eyes of his subjects
would have turned to him.

00:30:55.393 --> 00:30:58.638
He would have had a
pyramid, a ziggurat, a tower

00:30:58.741 --> 00:31:00.709
to hold his Crown of Fire.

00:31:00.812 --> 00:31:03.712
All I need to know is where it is.

00:31:03.815 --> 00:31:07.060
I don't know if you recall,
but you only said translate it.

00:31:07.163 --> 00:31:09.303
I-I translated it.

00:31:10.097 --> 00:31:11.685
Translate it again.

00:31:17.311 --> 00:31:20.349
One day, we're gonna laugh about this.

00:31:20.453 --> 00:31:22.593
Such an adventure we're having.

00:31:25.699 --> 00:31:30.048
I should go with you, just
for backup and awesomeness.

00:31:31.015 --> 00:31:32.672
This is pretty awesome.

00:31:32.775 --> 00:31:35.433
You got nature, the radio.

00:31:36.572 --> 00:31:40.196
Yeah, you're right, but it's
very, very important to me

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.164
that she knows that
I came to rescue her.

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:43.959
Why? Do you like this woman?

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.169
No, I just brought snacks and stuff.

00:31:47.272 --> 00:31:49.447
And she gets a little
grumpy when she's hungry.

00:31:49.551 --> 00:31:52.968
Blood pressure drops. And I get that
because I'm a five-meal-a-day kind of guy.

00:31:53.071 --> 00:31:55.867
Do you keto, by the way?
You look like you keto.

00:31:55.971 --> 00:31:57.662
- No.
- No. Yeah.

00:31:57.766 --> 00:31:59.492
You don't need it.

00:31:59.595 --> 00:32:01.079
What is it?

00:32:01.183 --> 00:32:04.773
I just want her to think of me
as more than a cover model.

00:32:04.876 --> 00:32:09.122
But, Alan, you are so much
more. You're my lookout.

00:32:09.225 --> 00:32:12.574
Okay, can I at least do the
part where I put her in the car

00:32:12.677 --> 00:32:16.405
and I just go, "Shh. You're safe now"?

00:32:17.475 --> 00:32:19.477
Sure, champ. She'll love that.

00:32:19.581 --> 00:32:21.445
Oh, you're just going? Going to start?

00:32:21.548 --> 00:32:23.964
You're starting the mission now? Okay.

00:32:48.161 --> 00:32:50.370
Oh!

00:32:59.413 --> 00:33:00.898
Go to sleep.

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.859
- Alan.
- What?

00:33:30.962 --> 00:33:32.723
This is a breach of trust, Alan.

00:33:32.826 --> 00:33:34.379
I can help. Let me help.

00:33:37.762 --> 00:33:40.420
Stay close. Stay alive.

00:33:45.287 --> 00:33:46.530
Hey.

00:33:51.465 --> 00:33:52.984
Go to sleep.

00:33:55.366 --> 00:33:59.473
I got his head. What do I do with his
head? I'm just gonna set him down.

00:34:05.618 --> 00:34:06.826
No.

00:34:07.412 --> 00:34:08.586
Hey, hey, no!

00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:09.898
No, no, no!

00:34:17.457 --> 00:34:19.286
Ooh, yeah! Ooh.

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.356
Ow.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.013
Teamwork, yeah!

00:34:22.117 --> 00:34:25.396
Great effort, Alan, but that
man was already unconscious.

00:34:25.499 --> 00:34:27.191
I was already wound up.

00:34:28.123 --> 00:34:30.884
Just don't do it when I'm...

00:34:33.956 --> 00:34:35.233
Hi.

00:34:37.477 --> 00:34:39.203
Oh!

00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:42.102
On your seven!

00:34:47.038 --> 00:34:48.108
Oh!

00:34:52.906 --> 00:34:54.839
Trainer, he's not asleep!

00:34:54.943 --> 00:34:57.117
Stay... Stay down. Stay down.

00:34:59.775 --> 00:35:02.295
- You're doing great.
- Thanks.

00:35:02.398 --> 00:35:03.917
Where you going?

00:35:12.063 --> 00:35:13.547
Loretta Sage?

00:35:14.031 --> 00:35:14.825
Yes.

00:35:14.928 --> 00:35:16.792
I'm getting you out of here.

00:35:17.828 --> 00:35:20.865
- Why are you so handsome?
- My dad was a weatherman.

00:35:23.074 --> 00:35:23.903
A-Alan?

00:35:24.006 --> 00:35:26.043
- Yeah.
- What are you doing here?

00:35:26.146 --> 00:35:28.942
- Uh, irregardless, I'm here to save you.
- That's not...

00:35:29.046 --> 00:35:31.289
- I think he meant "regardless."
- Yes.

00:35:32.705 --> 00:35:36.674
Ooh, uh, does she need saving in there,
Trainer? I think she's fine there.

00:35:36.778 --> 00:35:39.953
No, no, leave it. Don't take
their stuff. They'll come after us.

00:35:42.611 --> 00:35:44.164
Alan, why do you keep doing that?

00:35:44.268 --> 00:35:46.235
Why do you keep doing
that? I had that one.

00:35:46.339 --> 00:35:48.859
It's just getting mean
now. It's unnecessary.

00:35:48.962 --> 00:35:50.723
I'm sorry. I just wanted to get one in.

00:35:50.826 --> 00:35:53.118
Excuse me. Would it be possible
to remove me from the chair?

00:35:53.142 --> 00:35:53.898
No time.

00:35:54.002 --> 00:35:56.418
No time? There's been so much chitchat.

00:35:56.521 --> 00:35:57.833
We should definitely go.

00:35:57.937 --> 00:35:59.559
Let's go! Let's go!

00:36:25.412 --> 00:36:26.551
Why are things exploding?

00:36:34.214 --> 00:36:35.250
I got...

00:36:36.907 --> 00:36:38.115
Okay.

00:36:39.012 --> 00:36:40.289
Shh...

00:36:40.393 --> 00:36:42.291
Shh. You're safe now.

00:36:42.395 --> 00:36:43.534
You're...

00:36:43.637 --> 00:36:45.778
How... How are you so calm?

00:36:45.881 --> 00:36:48.366
- That was my... That was my line.
- Here.

00:36:50.506 --> 00:36:52.405
- What?
- Is that Reiki?

00:36:52.508 --> 00:36:54.959
- Are you healing me?
- I think so.

00:36:55.063 --> 00:36:58.273
- Ah.
- As Laozi says, "To the mind that is still..."

00:36:58.376 --> 00:37:01.276
- "...the whole universe surrenders."
- Hey, yeah, I know some...

00:37:01.379 --> 00:37:04.175
I know some, um, quotes that
could be good for this moment.

00:37:04.279 --> 00:37:06.005
In omnia paratus.

00:37:06.902 --> 00:37:08.766
"Ready for anything."

00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:11.527
Maybe we shouldn't be just
staring lovingly into each other's eyes

00:37:11.631 --> 00:37:15.083
like you're gonna fall
in love like I'm not here.

00:37:15.635 --> 00:37:16.601
Who are you?

00:37:16.705 --> 00:37:19.432
Just a guy trying to do his job.

00:37:19.535 --> 00:37:22.331
And right now, that job
is to get this lovely lady...

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:24.678
Oh! Oh.

00:37:24.782 --> 00:37:26.680
Oh, God. Okay.

00:37:27.854 --> 00:37:30.063
No. What is happening?

00:37:33.515 --> 00:37:35.482
Okay. What do we do?

00:37:35.586 --> 00:37:37.691
We need to do... I can't see.

00:37:37.795 --> 00:37:39.210
I don't like it!

00:37:39.314 --> 00:37:40.798
Here. Here!

00:37:40.902 --> 00:37:43.352
- Why would you throw a gun?
- Seriously?

00:37:44.733 --> 00:37:47.563
- Get me out of the chair.
- I can't. We don't have time.

00:37:51.119 --> 00:37:53.190
Gotta squeeze! You got
to do a Kegel or something!

00:37:53.293 --> 00:37:55.675
- Kegel it!
- What do you think a Kegel is?

00:37:55.779 --> 00:37:58.160
I'm not in it, not in! Still not in!

00:37:58.264 --> 00:38:00.645
- You got to go in more.
- Stop. Stop. Stop it!

00:38:00.749 --> 00:38:02.751
Oh, oh, oh!

00:38:02.855 --> 00:38:06.375
Oh, God. Get in the car, get in
the car! Start the car! Start the car!

00:38:06.479 --> 00:38:07.756
- Go, go.
- Move your leg.

00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:10.172
- Which one?
- Both of them! Move them!

00:38:13.935 --> 00:38:15.902
- Forward, forward!
- Okay. Okay.

00:38:16.006 --> 00:38:20.320
- I'm going! I'm going! Okay!
- Drive!

00:38:21.459 --> 00:38:25.084
Shh. You're safe now. Shh.

00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:28.121
Ow.

00:38:28.225 --> 00:38:30.365
- Shh. You're safe now.
- No, I'm not. Not safe.

00:38:30.468 --> 00:38:32.229
Oh, no, am I bleeding?

00:38:32.332 --> 00:38:35.335
- I don't think that's yours.
- Oh, no, that's a lot of blood.

00:38:36.647 --> 00:38:38.476
Cheese and rice!

00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.064
- Are those his brains?
- What?

00:38:40.168 --> 00:38:42.135
I think his brains are on my face!

00:38:42.239 --> 00:38:45.863
Definitely his brains are in my
mouth. I can taste his thoughts!

00:38:45.967 --> 00:38:47.175
Focus on the road.

00:38:47.278 --> 00:38:49.418
He just liked training people. Trainer.

00:38:49.522 --> 00:38:52.387
- What are you talking about?
- He loved me.

00:38:52.490 --> 00:38:55.079
Can you just scooch
the car over to the left?

00:38:55.183 --> 00:38:58.911
- Get it off. Get it off.
- Oh, God.

00:38:59.014 --> 00:39:00.291
Watch out!

00:39:04.502 --> 00:39:07.402
Oh! Oh! Oh!

00:39:09.645 --> 00:39:11.406
Oh, did you see...

00:39:14.374 --> 00:39:15.410
No.

00:39:20.829 --> 00:39:22.141
Oh.

00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:25.903
Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:39:26.455 --> 00:39:27.940
Oh, no.

00:39:36.362 --> 00:39:37.915
Oh, no.

00:39:38.605 --> 00:39:40.400
Alan?

00:39:40.504 --> 00:39:44.094
Oh, holy Christmas. Are
you okay? Are you okay?

00:39:44.197 --> 00:39:46.268
Do you think you could
get me out of here?

00:39:46.372 --> 00:39:47.925
Yeah. Okay.

00:39:48.029 --> 00:39:50.928
- You just flew out of the car.
- I did. I did, indeed.

00:39:51.032 --> 00:39:52.481
Okay. I got you. I got you.

00:39:52.585 --> 00:39:55.036
Can you get me out of the
chair? Get me out of the chair.

00:39:55.139 --> 00:39:56.969
You're right. You're
right. You're right.

00:39:58.315 --> 00:40:00.144
- Is that... Is that a nail filer?
- Yeah.

00:40:00.248 --> 00:40:01.732
- Can you just rip it?
- It's working.

00:40:01.835 --> 00:40:03.630
And maybe next time
I toss a gun at you,

00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.632
you can catch it instead of ducking.

00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:08.946
How about the next time you toss a
gun at me, you say, "Hey, Alan, catch"?

00:40:09.050 --> 00:40:10.914
Then maybe do that before you throw it?

00:40:11.017 --> 00:40:13.123
Well, "here" is a synonym for "catch."

00:40:13.226 --> 00:40:14.745
No, "here" is not a
cinnamon for "catch."

00:40:14.848 --> 00:40:16.920
In a colloquial kind
of way, yes, it is.

00:40:17.023 --> 00:40:19.129
You say, "Here," I
toss you a sweatshirt.

00:40:19.232 --> 00:40:21.234
You say, "Here," I toss you a pen.

00:40:21.338 --> 00:40:24.410
How 'bout just, "Hey! Catch! Gun!"

00:40:24.513 --> 00:40:27.516
Anything that you want to throw, I'll
catch it because you said, "Catch."

00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:29.380
And I'll catch it because you said it.

00:40:29.484 --> 00:40:31.900
That is also an option, and
then we would have a gun with us.

00:40:32.004 --> 00:40:33.108
That's a thing.

00:40:33.212 --> 00:40:35.490
- Be careful.
- Okay, we need to call...

00:40:35.593 --> 00:40:37.250
Be careful.

00:40:37.354 --> 00:40:39.873
We need to call for help, get to
the airport and get out of here.

00:40:39.977 --> 00:40:41.979
And I am driving.Okay.

00:40:44.188 --> 00:40:47.053
Oh. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:40:56.787 --> 00:40:59.169
Okay, call for... call for help.

00:40:59.272 --> 00:41:01.067
Where's your phone?

00:41:04.450 --> 00:41:05.485
Okay.

00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:11.940
- Tell me you caught them.
- I tagged the blond one.

00:41:13.597 --> 00:41:16.427
Oh, Loretta.

00:41:16.531 --> 00:41:18.602
What are you thinking?

00:41:18.705 --> 00:41:21.812
You might've killed one of them,
but his partner's still with her.

00:41:21.915 --> 00:41:25.574
And he is clearly
skilled, highly trained

00:41:26.575 --> 00:41:28.232
and very dangerous.

00:41:38.035 --> 00:41:42.108
So, Miss Sage said she
was gonna leave the event,

00:41:42.212 --> 00:41:46.871
then got in a car and left the event?

00:41:46.975 --> 00:41:49.667
- Did you try calling her?
- She doesn't have her phone.

00:41:49.771 --> 00:41:51.186
- Stolen phone.
- Didn't say that.

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:53.050
Where's my magnifier?

00:41:53.154 --> 00:41:55.156
Listen, can you please help with Nana?

00:41:55.259 --> 00:41:57.641
I don't want her hearing about
Loretta 'cause it's going to upset her.

00:41:57.744 --> 00:42:00.816
- What about Loretta?
- Nothing, Nana. She just went on a trip.

00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:02.197
Good. Yeah.

00:42:02.301 --> 00:42:04.751
That girl needed to
get out of the house.

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:09.032
So, this is the thing. Loretta's
phone is not stolen. I took it.

00:42:09.135 --> 00:42:13.588
I gave it to Alan. Alan then gave
it to the trainer, uh, Jack Trainer.

00:42:13.691 --> 00:42:15.969
And that is how we found her wearable.

00:42:16.073 --> 00:42:17.764
- And who's Alan?
- Dash.

00:42:17.868 --> 00:42:20.698
- What's that?
- He's the hero in all of her books.

00:42:20.802 --> 00:42:23.839
- Nana. Hey, slut.
- Mm-mmm.

00:42:23.943 --> 00:42:26.877
Let's go in the other room and talk
about whichever war you lived through.

00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.122
Okay. Come on, it'll be
fun. I'm sorry. It'll be fun.

00:42:30.225 --> 00:42:32.158
Listen, Loretta Sage is missing.

00:42:32.262 --> 00:42:34.471
When I looked at her smartwatch,
it said that she had flown

00:42:34.574 --> 00:42:36.231
to some island I've
never even heard about.

00:42:36.335 --> 00:42:38.061
That means y'all need to
do something about this.

00:42:38.164 --> 00:42:40.546
And if you can't, I will, and
that won't look good for you.

00:42:40.649 --> 00:42:43.376
Pretty sure that's
outside our jurisdiction.

00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:46.517
- You'd have to call the Feds.
- Okay.

00:42:46.621 --> 00:42:49.002
And if you do go to the Feds,
put in a good word for me.

00:42:49.106 --> 00:42:51.488
- For me.
- For us.

00:42:57.114 --> 00:42:58.633
Oh, oh.

00:43:05.674 --> 00:43:07.918
What are you gonna do,
put the car back together?

00:43:08.021 --> 00:43:10.231
Well... we could...

00:43:26.143 --> 00:43:28.835
- Where did you say the phone was?
- Passenger glove.

00:43:28.939 --> 00:43:30.699
- What?
- Passenger glove compartment.

00:43:30.803 --> 00:43:32.045
Goodness.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:34.669
Oh, my God.

00:43:34.772 --> 00:43:37.016
Oh, my God. No phone, no
car. We're so gonna die out...

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:38.845
- Here.
- What is this?

00:43:38.949 --> 00:43:40.606
Boots for the jungle.

00:43:41.469 --> 00:43:43.298
It's not exactly hiking boots, but...

00:43:43.402 --> 00:43:46.059
I figured your feet would be killing
you after wearing heels for this long.

00:43:46.163 --> 00:43:48.510
It was the best we could
do. They're Allison's. Sorry.

00:43:49.304 --> 00:43:51.375
Oh. Okay, well, thank you.

00:43:51.479 --> 00:43:53.274
Here, oh, I got you cheese.

00:43:53.377 --> 00:43:55.172
- Oh, my God.
- You got to stay hydrated.

00:43:55.276 --> 00:43:57.243
- Thank you so much.
- They didn't have glass bottles,

00:43:57.347 --> 00:43:59.349
so we'll definitely hold
onto it and recycle.

00:44:01.937 --> 00:44:06.632
Okay, so what we need to do is find a
phone, we need to call the authorities,

00:44:06.735 --> 00:44:09.635
and we need to wait here until
somebody comes and rescues us.

00:44:09.738 --> 00:44:13.259
Uh... This... This is the rescue.

00:44:13.363 --> 00:44:14.640
No one else is coming.

00:44:14.743 --> 00:44:16.711
- I'm sorry?
- I'm the rescue.

00:44:16.814 --> 00:44:19.748
It was originally just gonna be me,
then I was like, Trainer should come.

00:44:19.852 --> 00:44:21.578
Oh, Trainer. Rest in peace.

00:44:21.681 --> 00:44:25.927
So, our best bet is to get to the
airport. See this road right here?

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:28.723
From this area, just take a shortcut
through the jungle to the road.

00:44:28.826 --> 00:44:30.725
Did you just say "shortcut
through the jungle"?

00:44:30.828 --> 00:44:32.347
- Yeah.
- Okay, do you see us?

00:44:32.451 --> 00:44:34.970
- Uh-huh.
- You are not Dash, and I'm not Lovemore. Okay?

00:44:35.074 --> 00:44:36.489
I'm Loretta, and you are Alan.

00:44:36.593 --> 00:44:38.905
- And jungles eat people like us, okay?
- Eat people.

00:44:39.009 --> 00:44:42.323
And I don't want to mess up the jumpsuit.
It's on loan. So we're gonna stay put.

00:44:42.426 --> 00:44:44.359
We're not just gonna
stand around here, okay?

00:44:44.463 --> 00:44:45.843
We're gonna go through the jungle,

00:44:45.947 --> 00:44:48.052
we're gonna go to the
airport and find a phone,

00:44:48.156 --> 00:44:50.251
so you can have your cake
and get what you want.

00:44:50.275 --> 00:44:51.159
"And eat it too"?

00:44:51.263 --> 00:44:53.713
If that's what you want to do
with your cake, fine. Let's go.

00:44:53.817 --> 00:44:55.750
- That's the only thing you do with cake.
- Not mine.

00:44:55.853 --> 00:44:58.304
I don't know what your people
do, but my people eat it.

00:44:58.408 --> 00:45:00.617
You could give it to someone as a gift.

00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.929
Those people are still
going to eat the cake.

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:04.586
Everybody eats cake.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:06.519
What about the kind people jump out of?

00:45:06.623 --> 00:45:09.557
- They don't eat it, when they're in it.
- Oh, my God.

00:45:35.859 --> 00:45:37.447
What did they kidnap you for anyhow?

00:45:37.550 --> 00:45:39.414
Is it some weird sex stuff like Taken?

00:45:39.518 --> 00:45:41.071
Oh, my God, thank you.

00:45:41.174 --> 00:45:43.901
I thought so too, but the
guy's one of the Fairfaxes.

00:45:44.005 --> 00:45:45.834
- Beverly?
- No, the older one.

00:45:45.938 --> 00:45:49.390
The really odd one that had the
vlog on finding Montezuma's treasure.

00:45:49.493 --> 00:45:51.909
The dude that was on the news
for trying to raise the Titanic?

00:45:52.013 --> 00:45:53.808
Yes, he's looking
for the Crown of Fire.

00:45:53.911 --> 00:45:57.881
Wait a minute. Like the actual
Crown of Fire? Like the one...

00:45:57.984 --> 00:46:01.333
- So those ruins were...
- They were the Lost City of D, yes.

00:46:01.436 --> 00:46:03.749
- What? Are you kidding me right now?
- Shh.

00:46:03.852 --> 00:46:05.302
This is like your book.

00:46:05.406 --> 00:46:08.236
So we're basically on a Lovemore
and Dash adventure right now?

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.342
What is that?

00:46:10.445 --> 00:46:12.930
What if Fairfax
actually finds the crown?

00:46:13.034 --> 00:46:14.415
He won't. He won't.

00:46:16.589 --> 00:46:17.694
- Where do we go?
- Uh...

00:46:17.797 --> 00:46:19.765
Oh, oh, oh.

00:46:22.837 --> 00:46:24.977
Okay, uh, we need to get in the water.

00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:27.186
- W-What?
- We need to go by river.

00:46:27.290 --> 00:46:29.119
No, no, I don't really do water.

00:46:29.222 --> 00:46:31.570
What do you mean, "do water"? I'm
not asking you to procreate with it.

00:46:31.673 --> 00:46:34.124
Uh, my body and water
don't really go together.

00:46:34.227 --> 00:46:36.575
How do you feel about dying? Oh, God.

00:46:36.678 --> 00:46:38.542
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're okay. You're okay.

00:46:38.646 --> 00:46:41.476
- I got you. Fine.
- I can swim. I can swim. Thank you very much.

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:43.651
- Where are you going?
- I'm crossing.

00:46:43.754 --> 00:46:45.722
No, we have to stay in the water.

00:46:45.825 --> 00:46:48.276
I researched aquatic counter-tracking
for my book, A Year in the Bush.

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.382
They'll lose our tracks in the water.

00:46:50.485 --> 00:46:53.281
Why is it warm here?
Wait, are you peeing?

00:46:53.385 --> 00:46:55.387
Just go around it.

00:47:24.174 --> 00:47:25.693
Okay, I think...

00:47:25.796 --> 00:47:27.695
I think we lost them, right?

00:47:27.798 --> 00:47:30.801
Yeah. That wasn't so bad. Yeah.

00:47:30.905 --> 00:47:32.562
Okay, uh...

00:47:32.665 --> 00:47:35.081
- Don't panic.
- What do you mean, don't panic?

00:47:35.185 --> 00:47:36.393
- Just don't panic.
- No.

00:47:36.497 --> 00:47:38.257
Stop saying "panic." I'm panicking now.

00:47:38.361 --> 00:47:40.224
You have something on your back.

00:47:41.743 --> 00:47:42.537
No!

00:47:42.641 --> 00:47:44.125
- Stop screaming.
- What is that?

00:47:44.228 --> 00:47:45.471
- What is that?
- Stop screaming.

00:47:45.575 --> 00:47:47.024
- Do you have any on you?
- No. No.

00:47:47.128 --> 00:47:48.578
Why don't you have any on you?

00:47:48.681 --> 00:47:50.476
Maybe the jumpsuit scared
them off. I don't know.

00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:52.098
- Get 'em off.
- Oh, my God.

00:47:52.202 --> 00:47:54.722
Okay. No, I can't touch those
blood-gorged mucous sacks.

00:47:54.825 --> 00:47:56.275
- Can you fling it?
- Right now.

00:47:56.379 --> 00:47:57.759
- Get it.
- Just pick it and fling it.

00:47:57.863 --> 00:47:59.761
- Just pick it and fling it.
- You pick it and fling it!

00:47:59.865 --> 00:48:01.936
- Can you spin it off?
- Please, get it off.

00:48:02.039 --> 00:48:04.076
I don't like touching
it. I'm feeling faint.

00:48:04.179 --> 00:48:07.286
- They're sucking my soul out.
- Okay, okay. Stop, stop, stop.

00:48:08.943 --> 00:48:11.186
Don't make that sound.

00:48:14.776 --> 00:48:16.260
How many of them are there?

00:48:16.364 --> 00:48:17.883
Oh, there's not many.

00:48:17.986 --> 00:48:19.988
- It feels like there's so many.
- What are you...

00:48:20.092 --> 00:48:21.404
- I feel so many.
- Oh!

00:48:21.507 --> 00:48:24.061
- Holy mother of God!
- Why are you praying?

00:48:24.165 --> 00:48:27.202
Is it that bad? It can't be that
bad. Is it that bad? How many?

00:48:27.306 --> 00:48:28.549
It's not great.

00:48:28.652 --> 00:48:30.309
They're gonna suck every bit of me out.

00:48:30.413 --> 00:48:33.070
Just please stop speaking. I
just need to... need to get low.

00:48:33.174 --> 00:48:34.900
Hold on a second.

00:48:35.003 --> 00:48:37.799
Oh, God! I can feel them just...
they're just sucking out so much.

00:48:37.903 --> 00:48:40.768
I'm gonna be like a shriveled-up
skin sack when they're done.

00:48:40.871 --> 00:48:42.839
You cannot tell my dad
I died this way, okay?

00:48:42.942 --> 00:48:46.981
You gotta tell him I was wrestling an
anaconda with a sword or something.

00:48:47.084 --> 00:48:49.880
I'm like a blood Jamba Juice.
They're just sucking it all out.

00:48:49.984 --> 00:48:51.606
Why are they all on my butt though?

00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:54.333
Kind of like picking anchovies
off my Caesar salad.

00:48:54.437 --> 00:48:56.162
- It's actually not so bad.
- Anchovies?

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:57.854
Why do you go to food right now?

00:48:57.957 --> 00:49:00.822
Just find the queen, and
let's be done with this.

00:49:00.926 --> 00:49:03.273
Think you're good. I need
to just check your front.

00:49:03.376 --> 00:49:05.620
Okay. I can't look.

00:49:07.864 --> 00:49:09.175
Is it bad?

00:49:09.279 --> 00:49:12.385
- Uh, wow.
- What is it? Just say it.

00:49:12.489 --> 00:49:15.837
I mean, you expect
it to, you know, not...

00:49:15.941 --> 00:49:18.668
Then suddenly there
it is, and it is, uh...

00:49:18.771 --> 00:49:21.015
- You know, you get excited for a person.
- What?

00:49:21.118 --> 00:49:23.742
- I mean, I'm excited for all people.
- Why are you excited?

00:49:23.845 --> 00:49:26.158
Well, you know, people
wonder, they wonder,

00:49:26.261 --> 00:49:27.884
but they don't know, right?

00:49:27.987 --> 00:49:30.473
They don't, until
suddenly they do know,

00:49:30.576 --> 00:49:34.891
and then they... they know
something that wasn't known before.

00:49:34.994 --> 00:49:36.858
Just... Do I have any leeches or not?

00:49:36.962 --> 00:49:41.069
Oh, your plucky warrior
hangs in tranquil solitude.

00:49:41.173 --> 00:49:42.277
What?

00:49:42.381 --> 00:49:44.521
No, you're good. You're good.

00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:47.386
We were so brave just then.

00:49:47.490 --> 00:49:49.733
Why do they go for the butt so much?

00:50:11.030 --> 00:50:13.895
What's that song you're singing?

00:50:13.999 --> 00:50:17.002
A song my abbi used to
sing to me when I was a kid.

00:50:17.968 --> 00:50:20.626
"If you suck life from the island...

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:23.526
...the island will suck of you."

00:50:23.629 --> 00:50:27.564
Your grandma sang you songs about
getting sucked off by an island?

00:50:27.668 --> 00:50:30.015
It doesn't translate super well.

00:50:30.912 --> 00:50:33.743
Is phantom leech
syndrome, like, a thing?

00:50:33.846 --> 00:50:35.848
They don't lay eggs, do they?

00:51:24.966 --> 00:51:26.174
Queen Taha?

00:51:39.774 --> 00:51:44.158
"King Kalaman and his
treasure laid to rest..."

00:51:45.090 --> 00:51:48.749
laid to rest in the
well of endless tears.

00:51:48.852 --> 00:51:50.785
"Laid to rest in the
well of endless tears."

00:51:50.889 --> 00:51:52.753
- What does that mean?
- Loretta!

00:51:53.443 --> 00:51:55.169
You gave me a heart attack.

00:51:55.859 --> 00:51:57.516
Where'd you go?

00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:03.142
What is this?

00:52:03.246 --> 00:52:06.490
I'm not sure, but maybe
they gathered here?

00:52:09.045 --> 00:52:11.703
Can you imagine being right here,

00:52:11.806 --> 00:52:14.464
right in this very spot back then?

00:52:14.567 --> 00:52:16.293
The stories that they told?

00:52:16.397 --> 00:52:19.158
So much history I'm
sure happened right here.

00:52:24.474 --> 00:52:25.855
They've got us cornered.

00:52:25.958 --> 00:52:27.650
- Okay. We've got to go up. Come on.
- What?

00:52:27.753 --> 00:52:30.860
Have you seen what I'm wearing?
I'm in a glitter straitjacket.

00:52:30.963 --> 00:52:33.932
There's nowhere to go
but up. Come on. Let's go.

00:52:34.035 --> 00:52:37.590
Oh! I should not be doing
this. I'm too old for this.

00:52:37.694 --> 00:52:38.799
No, you're not. You're beautiful.

00:52:38.902 --> 00:52:40.559
I didn't say I'm not beautiful.

00:52:40.663 --> 00:52:42.561
I said I'm too old to be doing this.

00:52:42.665 --> 00:52:46.289
My skill is sitting and thinking
and eating when I can't think.

00:52:46.392 --> 00:52:48.809
Yeah, you definitely could be
wearing better shoes for this.

00:52:48.912 --> 00:52:50.811
You brought me these shoes.

00:52:50.914 --> 00:52:53.468
I can't go any further.
I can't go any further.

00:52:53.572 --> 00:52:55.298
I'm not doing so great here.

00:52:55.401 --> 00:52:56.817
You got it. Come on.

00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.784
I know you think that
you're safer holding on,

00:52:58.888 --> 00:53:00.165
but you have to keep going.

00:53:00.268 --> 00:53:02.167
- I can't. I can't, I can't.
- Okay?

00:53:02.961 --> 00:53:04.410
- Do you smell that?
- Smell what?

00:53:04.514 --> 00:53:06.274
- I smell something.
- Is it a predator? What is it?

00:53:06.378 --> 00:53:08.311
- A downward cascading fire?
- You got to smell deeper.

00:53:08.414 --> 00:53:09.588
I don't smell anything!

00:53:13.005 --> 00:53:16.250
Take a big, deep breath.

00:53:16.353 --> 00:53:17.665
All right.

00:53:17.769 --> 00:53:19.391
Good job.Okay.

00:53:19.494 --> 00:53:23.119
- That was manipulative. Thank you.
- Yeah, it was.

00:53:23.222 --> 00:53:25.708
Here we go. I'm gonna help
you out a little bit, all right?

00:53:25.811 --> 00:53:27.882
- One, two, three... Here we go!
- What are you doing?

00:53:27.986 --> 00:53:29.366
- Get out of there.
- Come on.

00:53:29.470 --> 00:53:31.541
- No, no, don't flex.
- That's my hoo-hoo.

00:53:31.644 --> 00:53:34.578
Just ride the head. Keep the
hands moving and ride the head.

00:53:34.682 --> 00:53:35.994
- Oh, God.
- You're doing great.

00:53:36.097 --> 00:53:38.755
Sorry about the scratchy
haircut. Come on.

00:53:58.844 --> 00:54:01.088
Dulcius ex asperis.

00:54:01.674 --> 00:54:03.055
What was that?

00:54:03.159 --> 00:54:04.677
Oh, nothing.

00:54:04.781 --> 00:54:07.025
It was just something
that John and I would say

00:54:07.128 --> 00:54:10.269
after we finished
something big, like a...

00:54:10.373 --> 00:54:12.340
like an archaeological
dig or a manuscript.

00:54:12.444 --> 00:54:15.758
It's Latin. It means
"sweeter after difficulty."

00:54:16.897 --> 00:54:18.277
What's...

00:54:18.381 --> 00:54:20.314
What's Latin for "Loretta's a badass"?

00:54:20.417 --> 00:54:24.905
I am a badass. I climbed a mountain.

00:54:25.008 --> 00:54:27.977
Oh, my God. I wish Beth
could've seen us do this.

00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.911
- Oh, God. Beth.
- Don't worry about Beth.

00:54:31.014 --> 00:54:34.500
She's probably got the whole
navy after us right now.

00:54:34.604 --> 00:54:37.676
<i>I get that you think you have to
go to the island authorities yourself,</i>

00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:41.197
<i>but don't worry, I'm keeping
Loretta's socials super active.</i>

00:54:41.300 --> 00:54:43.682
<i>Just tweeted, "Did I
just get kidnapped?</i>

00:54:43.786 --> 00:54:47.306
<i>

00:54:47.410 --> 00:54:49.067
And you're traveling alone?

00:54:49.170 --> 00:54:52.001
Yes, I'm traveling alone.
Mm-hmm. I'm single.

00:54:52.587 --> 00:54:53.796
Then this might work.

00:54:53.899 --> 00:54:55.728
- Okay! Talk to me.
- You'll hit New York.

00:54:55.832 --> 00:54:59.353
From there, you'll fly to Guinea, where
you can pick up a puddle jumper.

00:54:59.456 --> 00:55:00.526
A what?

00:55:01.458 --> 00:55:02.943
- Small plane.
<i>- Yeah, no leg room.</i>

00:55:03.046 --> 00:55:04.220
That's fine. I'll take it.

00:55:04.323 --> 00:55:06.360
- <i>Or you could just come home.</i>
- Thank you.

00:55:14.230 --> 00:55:16.715
We need something more flammable.
Everything is just so wet.

00:55:16.819 --> 00:55:18.337
What's in here? What's in your bag?

00:55:18.441 --> 00:55:20.305
- Uh...
- Oh, a lot. Okay.

00:55:20.408 --> 00:55:21.858
What are you doing?

00:55:21.962 --> 00:55:23.826
Okay. Face masks.

00:55:23.929 --> 00:55:25.344
Yeah, that was like
a gift-basket thing.

00:55:25.448 --> 00:55:27.415
You brought a scented
candle into the jungle?

00:55:27.519 --> 00:55:28.796
My mom gave me that.

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.453
It was like a weird
gift for Mother's Day.

00:55:30.556 --> 00:55:32.835
Your mom gives you
gifts for Mother's Day?

00:55:34.146 --> 00:55:34.940
Noir...

00:55:35.044 --> 00:55:37.011
Eucalyptus rosemary oil. Ooh.

00:55:37.598 --> 00:55:38.875
Oh, that smells good.

00:55:38.979 --> 00:55:41.153
Um... Oh, okay. All right.

00:55:41.257 --> 00:55:42.879
Whoo! Yes!

00:55:42.983 --> 00:55:45.433
Yes, I made fire!

00:55:45.537 --> 00:55:49.092
- That's pretty impressive. You have to...
- It is a beautiful fire.

00:55:49.196 --> 00:55:51.129
Who would have thought?

00:55:51.232 --> 00:55:53.717
Oh, you're just, um,
taking your shirt off?

00:55:54.822 --> 00:55:56.859
That looks really uncomfortable.

00:55:56.962 --> 00:55:58.861
Are you okay? The back?

00:55:58.964 --> 00:56:03.037
Yeah. That is why I don't do water.

00:56:03.141 --> 00:56:05.419
- Okay.
- My body becomes an eighth-grader's face.

00:56:05.522 --> 00:56:08.387
Do you have anything for it?
Like some ointment or something?

00:56:08.491 --> 00:56:10.389
Yeah, I do. Well, I did.

00:56:10.493 --> 00:56:12.564
It was in a little, tiny little bottle.

00:56:12.667 --> 00:56:14.635
It was this. I'm sorry.

00:56:14.738 --> 00:56:16.775
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

00:56:16.879 --> 00:56:18.225
It's okay.

00:56:18.328 --> 00:56:20.641
- Hold on. Yes. Come here. Come here.
- What?

00:56:20.744 --> 00:56:23.161
- Come here. Sit down.
- Let me see.

00:56:23.264 --> 00:56:24.748
- Just sit down.
- Right here?

00:56:24.852 --> 00:56:26.060
Yeah.

00:56:27.268 --> 00:56:28.891
Okay.

00:56:28.994 --> 00:56:30.858
Oh, no, you don't have to
touch it. It's okay. It's fine.

00:56:30.962 --> 00:56:32.964
I touched your engorged sacks, so...

00:56:35.173 --> 00:56:36.899
- The leeches.
- Oh, okay.

00:56:37.002 --> 00:56:39.798
Okay, this might be a little bit cold.

00:56:40.972 --> 00:56:42.697
- Sorry.
- Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

00:56:42.801 --> 00:56:44.078
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:56:44.182 --> 00:56:46.149
Maybe this is how Dash should die.

00:56:46.253 --> 00:56:49.290
Horrible eczema
outbreak. That's so sexy.

00:56:49.394 --> 00:56:50.913
I could make it work.

00:56:51.361 --> 00:56:52.397
Yeah?

00:56:53.053 --> 00:56:54.502
All right, then.

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:57.505
How would you write this?

00:56:57.609 --> 00:56:59.093
Okay.

00:57:00.992 --> 00:57:04.305
"Warmed by the fragrant fire..."

00:57:04.409 --> 00:57:06.859
Mm-hmm.

00:57:06.963 --> 00:57:08.861
Starting strong.Mm-hmm.

00:57:08.965 --> 00:57:12.072
"Lovemore's hands explored the..."

00:57:13.832 --> 00:57:16.317
The contoured scenery

00:57:16.421 --> 00:57:18.009
of Dash's body.

00:57:20.149 --> 00:57:22.841
Familiar terrain made

00:57:22.945 --> 00:57:25.292
new and exciting with every...

00:57:26.224 --> 00:57:28.571
"with every scarlet rim."

00:57:29.675 --> 00:57:31.367
And that didn't, uh...

00:57:32.195 --> 00:57:33.714
didn't turn her off?

00:57:33.817 --> 00:57:35.026
No.

00:57:35.854 --> 00:57:37.683
"Because with every cardinal ridge,

00:57:38.684 --> 00:57:41.101
Lovemore discovered
another letter in the language

00:57:41.204 --> 00:57:43.310
"that only their bodies spoke."

00:57:44.345 --> 00:57:46.382
And what were their bodies saying?

00:57:48.349 --> 00:57:49.902
"Take me..."

00:57:51.801 --> 00:57:53.423
Take me,

00:57:54.010 --> 00:57:55.701
"take me."

00:57:55.805 --> 00:57:57.117
How's that?

00:57:57.945 --> 00:57:59.222
It was good.

00:57:59.326 --> 00:58:01.052
- Your back. I mean, how is your back?
- Good.

00:58:01.155 --> 00:58:02.570
- Okay. You sure?
- Yeah.

00:58:02.674 --> 00:58:07.230
- I also meant my back. Right there, yeah.
- Okay.

00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:16.515
Supplies.

00:58:18.655 --> 00:58:22.935
Okay, I'm chilly. I think I'm gonna
probably turn in in a little bit.

00:58:23.039 --> 00:58:24.247
- Okay.
- You good?

00:58:24.351 --> 00:58:27.009
Yeah, I'm fire... fine. I'm fine.

00:58:27.112 --> 00:58:30.046
I'm not "fire." I'm fine by the fire.

00:58:30.736 --> 00:58:32.462
Okay. All right.

00:58:40.367 --> 00:58:43.680
Uh, it's up to you, but if you're cold,

00:58:43.784 --> 00:58:47.995
maybe we could probably both
fit in here, if you wanted to.

00:58:48.651 --> 00:58:50.377
Both of us?

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:53.518
- Only if you want to. I mean, it's just...
- Yeah, no, that sounds...

00:58:53.621 --> 00:58:55.106
Uh...

00:58:55.209 --> 00:58:56.590
Okay. How do you...

00:58:56.693 --> 00:58:58.661
You can go first,
then I'll figure it out.

00:58:58.764 --> 00:59:01.905
No, no, you go. It's definitely
a "ladies first" type of situation.

00:59:02.009 --> 00:59:04.667
- Keep hands out of the bag at all times.
- That's what I was gonna do.

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:06.427
- Butt to butt.
- Hands out and butt to butt.

00:59:06.531 --> 00:59:09.844
- Yeah. What do I do?
- Just get in. Go ahead and sit.

00:59:09.948 --> 00:59:12.640
I sit first? Okay. I'm in.

00:59:14.194 --> 00:59:16.782
You're too heavy. You're gonna
flip this thing like a cruise ship.

00:59:16.886 --> 00:59:19.544
You watch yourself.
Hold on. I'm not in.

00:59:19.647 --> 00:59:22.823
Why is this engaging my core so much?

00:59:23.617 --> 00:59:25.515
How 'bout you shimmy?

00:59:25.619 --> 00:59:27.724
- I can't breathe. I'm not breathing.
- Are you good?

00:59:27.828 --> 00:59:29.140
My face.

00:59:29.726 --> 00:59:30.969
Yeah. Okay.

00:59:34.076 --> 00:59:35.560
Hands are out. Butt to butt.

00:59:35.663 --> 00:59:36.699
Okay.

01:00:07.902 --> 01:00:09.490
Well!

01:00:09.594 --> 01:00:10.733
Come on.

01:00:10.836 --> 01:00:12.493
Come on! Let's hear it!

01:00:12.597 --> 01:00:16.083
Let's give a nice round
of applause to Loretta!

01:00:16.187 --> 01:00:17.809
She earned it.

01:00:17.912 --> 01:00:21.778
A geriatric shut-in left you
holding your dicks in the jungle.

01:00:21.882 --> 01:00:23.263
Good job, Loretta.

01:00:23.366 --> 01:00:25.886
Boss, come on. People are dying now.

01:00:25.989 --> 01:00:29.648
Don't you think that maybe
this has all gone too far?

01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:32.617
Is it really worth it?

01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:36.103
I am on the cusp of
attaining the unattainable.

01:00:36.207 --> 01:00:39.210
Something singular,
something no nation,

01:00:39.313 --> 01:00:42.903
no emperor, no brownnosing
brothers ever have.

01:00:43.006 --> 01:00:46.113
The legendary Crown of Fire.

01:00:46.562 --> 01:00:47.701
So, yes.

01:00:47.804 --> 01:00:50.117
Yes, I would definitely
say it's worth it.

01:00:59.851 --> 01:01:01.370
Excuse me!

01:01:01.473 --> 01:01:04.373
Excuse me, sir. I need to get
to my next connecting flight.

01:01:04.476 --> 01:01:05.822
No flight.

01:01:05.926 --> 01:01:08.515
The pilot is sick. Come tomorrow.

01:01:08.618 --> 01:01:10.758
No, no, sir. I cannot come
tomorrow. I need to do this today.

01:01:10.862 --> 01:01:15.591
I need to get to the island Isla
Hundida tonight. Lives are at stake.

01:01:15.694 --> 01:01:17.179
Come tomorrow.

01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:22.701
- Excuse me, miss?
- Yes?

01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:26.878
I couldn't help but overhear
you say that you like steak.

01:01:26.981 --> 01:01:30.261
Okay, this is a little bit crazy,

01:01:30.364 --> 01:01:32.159
but I also like steak.

01:01:32.263 --> 01:01:34.610
- What?
- I also like steak.

01:01:34.713 --> 01:01:38.165
Would you like to,
maybe, I don't know...

01:01:38.269 --> 01:01:41.099
- Maybe there's a...
- No. "Lives are at stake."

01:01:41.203 --> 01:01:42.963
I need to go to the island tonight.

01:01:43.066 --> 01:01:44.482
- Ah.
- Yes.

01:01:44.585 --> 01:01:46.173
- Even more serious.
- Extremely.

01:01:46.277 --> 01:01:49.280
Well, I believe that I
may be able to assist you.

01:01:49.383 --> 01:01:51.316
I have a cargo plane.

01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:56.183
Maybe after I make my delivery,
we could swing by your island.

01:01:56.287 --> 01:01:59.082
I'm about to ask you something,
and you better tell me the truth.

01:01:59.186 --> 01:02:01.050
Have you ever murdered anyone before?

01:02:01.153 --> 01:02:04.398
No!

01:02:07.988 --> 01:02:10.715
I don't know if I really buy it,
but let me tell you something.

01:02:10.818 --> 01:02:15.064
If you ever think about murdering
me, I promise, I will murder you first.

01:02:15.167 --> 01:02:16.514
My pleasure.

01:02:16.617 --> 01:02:18.757
You are weird. Let's go.

01:03:14.157 --> 01:03:17.575
"King Kalaman and his
treasure laid to rest in the well

01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:19.646
of endless tears."

01:03:21.337 --> 01:03:22.511
What is that?

01:03:23.684 --> 01:03:27.136
Oh, it's a... it's a thing.
I mean, it's not, uh...

01:03:27.239 --> 01:03:29.483
You know, it's not
what you think it is.

01:03:29.587 --> 01:03:33.384
So it's not Fairfax's fragment
of an ancient parchment?

01:03:33.487 --> 01:03:37.284
Okay. It's what you think it is.

01:03:37.388 --> 01:03:38.837
Loretta, I thought you
were smarter than that.

01:03:38.941 --> 01:03:41.737
Fairfax is never gonna
stop hunting us now.

01:03:41.840 --> 01:03:42.841
What were you thinking?

01:03:42.945 --> 01:03:44.912
We have a volcano
that could bury the tomb

01:03:45.016 --> 01:03:48.571
before we get to it, before we see
it, before we preserve its memory.

01:03:48.675 --> 01:03:50.608
- This is...
- I'm sorry. Is that what we're doing?

01:03:50.711 --> 01:03:53.231
'Cause no one told me.
When were you gonna tell me?

01:03:53.335 --> 01:03:54.750
Why would I tell you?

01:03:54.853 --> 01:03:56.683
We're in this together. I
came here to rescue you.

01:03:56.786 --> 01:03:58.478
You know you're not Dash, right?

01:03:58.581 --> 01:04:00.825
You don't ride in on a
white horse to rescue people.

01:04:00.928 --> 01:04:05.208
You... spray yourself with bronzer and
you stand in front of wind machines,

01:04:05.312 --> 01:04:06.831
which is great for you.

01:04:06.934 --> 01:04:09.592
How would you have any
idea what I'm actually like?

01:04:09.696 --> 01:04:12.630
I know you. You're a
pretty open book, Alan.

01:04:12.733 --> 01:04:14.528
- Okay, then who am I?
- Really?

01:04:14.632 --> 01:04:15.667
Yeah.

01:04:17.738 --> 01:04:19.947
O... Okay, uh...

01:04:20.051 --> 01:04:23.157
You were a homecoming king and
you coasted on your good looks to LA,

01:04:23.261 --> 01:04:25.781
but then realized that being the most
handsome kid in the middle of nowhere

01:04:25.884 --> 01:04:27.610
doesn't mean you're going to be a star.

01:04:27.714 --> 01:04:29.543
Until one day, when a woman
who couldn't publish her book

01:04:29.647 --> 01:04:33.236
on Spanish colonization in the Atlantic
decided to write a romance novel,

01:04:33.340 --> 01:04:35.273
uh, chose you at
random to be on the cover.

01:04:35.377 --> 01:04:38.794
Lucky for you and her, the
novels were a smashing success.

01:04:38.897 --> 01:04:41.900
She kept writing her
schlock, you kept posing,

01:04:42.004 --> 01:04:47.458
um, you know, neither one of us
becoming who we'd hoped we would be.

01:04:47.561 --> 01:04:51.669
Uh, and then one day,
we both die in the jungle

01:04:51.772 --> 01:04:55.673
on one of those Atlantic islands
I wrote about all those years ago.

01:04:55.776 --> 01:04:56.812
Right?

01:04:58.158 --> 01:04:59.470
Mm-hmm.

01:05:10.757 --> 01:05:12.483
It was Sarasota, by the way.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.588
It's not nowhere.

01:05:14.692 --> 01:05:16.935
I grew up there with
my mom and two sisters.

01:05:17.039 --> 01:05:18.074
And yeah...

01:05:19.075 --> 01:05:21.768
I started modeling 'cause
I wanted to get away.

01:05:21.871 --> 01:05:23.804
It was the only job
that I could think of

01:05:23.908 --> 01:05:27.152
that could take me to all of the
places that I always dreamed of going.

01:05:27.256 --> 01:05:28.568
Then finally to Los Angeles,

01:05:28.671 --> 01:05:31.433
where I posed on the cover
of your romance novel.

01:05:31.536 --> 01:05:34.436
And I was so embarrassed that
one of my friends might've seen me

01:05:34.539 --> 01:05:36.679
in that wig on the cover of your book

01:05:36.783 --> 01:05:39.441
that I avoided talking
to them for months.

01:05:40.407 --> 01:05:41.891
And then one day,

01:05:42.616 --> 01:05:44.480
I'm walking home,

01:05:44.584 --> 01:05:47.379
and I hear this lady yell, "Dash!"

01:05:47.483 --> 01:05:50.003
She runs up, and she is so happy.

01:05:50.106 --> 01:05:53.869
Then I thought, "How
could I be this embarrassed

01:05:53.972 --> 01:05:56.665
about something that
makes people this happy?"

01:06:00.013 --> 01:06:01.704
Loretta, you can do whatever you want.

01:06:01.808 --> 01:06:03.913
If you don't want to
write anymore, don't write.

01:06:04.017 --> 01:06:08.504
But don't minimize the people that
love your work by calling it schlock.

01:06:08.608 --> 01:06:11.162
That's not fair to them.

01:06:12.370 --> 01:06:15.269
You know what's ironic? I thought
you of all people would know

01:06:15.373 --> 01:06:17.824
not to judge a book by its cover.

01:06:21.897 --> 01:06:24.486
Judge a book by its cover model.

01:06:55.965 --> 01:06:57.139
Alan?

01:06:57.242 --> 01:06:58.520
Alan.

01:07:10.497 --> 01:07:11.843
There's two of them.

01:07:17.953 --> 01:07:20.645
- Loretta! I'm over here!
- Alan!

01:07:21.715 --> 01:07:24.787
Alan! Motorcycles and
guns, motorcycles and guns!

01:07:24.891 --> 01:07:27.031
Come on, this way!

01:07:27.134 --> 01:07:28.757
Stop shooting!

01:07:34.003 --> 01:07:35.971
- Just give 'em the parchment!
- I can't.

01:07:36.074 --> 01:07:38.732
Yes, you can, actually. You just
say, "Here," and throw it at 'em.

01:07:38.836 --> 01:07:41.148
Right. And then I'm sure
they'll happily let us go.

01:07:41.252 --> 01:07:43.254
- Okay, keep down.
- How do they keep finding us?

01:07:43.357 --> 01:07:45.843
- You're basically a walking disco ball.
- We need to come up with a plan.

01:07:45.946 --> 01:07:47.016
I have an idea.

01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:48.570
We're gonna dig a
hole, throw our voices.

01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:50.606
"We're over here." Can
you sound like a bird?

01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:53.022
- No, I have a plan.
- Alan, please, I'm thinking.

01:07:53.126 --> 01:07:56.819
- I know, but I have a plan.
- Please, just let me think about...

01:07:56.923 --> 01:08:00.547
- Wait a minute. They're shooting at you.
- Yeah, that's why we're hiding.

01:08:00.651 --> 01:08:02.963
No. No, no, no. They're
shooting only at you.

01:08:03.067 --> 01:08:05.587
They won't shoot me. It's
my brain that's valuable.

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:09.556
What? I don't think you actually
hear the things you say sometimes.

01:08:09.660 --> 01:08:12.352
- Maybe I can shield you.
- You are not shielding me.

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.699
- I should be shielding you.
- Why? Because I'm a woman?

01:08:14.803 --> 01:08:17.875
- That's supremely sexist.
- Well, look, I don't think using women as human shields

01:08:17.978 --> 01:08:20.705
is exactly the change that Gloria
Seinfeld had in mind, do you?

01:08:20.809 --> 01:08:23.639
- Gloria Steinem?
- Whatever. Her too. You know what? Fine.

01:08:23.743 --> 01:08:26.815
- Please mansplain sexism to me right now.
- Oh, my God. I am a woman.

01:08:26.918 --> 01:08:29.024
I can't mansplain anything.

01:08:29.127 --> 01:08:33.856
Uh, I'm a feminist, and I think a
woman can do anything a man can do.

01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:36.410
- We just need to stay here until they get tired.
- I have an idea.

01:08:36.514 --> 01:08:38.205
- Please can I tell you my plan?
- Alan!

01:08:38.309 --> 01:08:41.623
This is not a situation you can
get out of by ripping your shirt off.

01:08:41.726 --> 01:08:43.659
Not my shirt.

01:09:15.104 --> 01:09:16.416
Three!

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:18.107
- Yes!
- Oh!

01:09:22.215 --> 01:09:24.079
Oh.

01:09:24.182 --> 01:09:27.427
That was different
than I had in my head.

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:31.603
- I just wanted us to stop them.
- Could it have been the wind that made it do that?

01:09:31.707 --> 01:09:33.813
No, I think it was us.
I think... we did it.

01:09:33.916 --> 01:09:36.332
We did the one guy,
right? But that was, like...

01:09:36.436 --> 01:09:39.784
We just wanted him to stop. But I think
the other guy could've moved, really.

01:09:39.888 --> 01:09:42.028
So, that was... that one was on him.

01:09:42.131 --> 01:09:44.996
Even if we weren't here,
that could've happened.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.826
Why are you gonna stop next to a cliff?

01:09:46.929 --> 01:09:49.380
They were wearing helmets,
so maybe they're...

01:09:49.483 --> 01:09:51.658
But the rest of their body
didn't have a helmet.

01:09:51.762 --> 01:09:52.970
So there'd just be a head.

01:09:53.073 --> 01:09:55.351
They were driving recklessly, right?

01:09:55.455 --> 01:09:57.181
Don't be mean on a bike.

01:09:57.871 --> 01:09:59.631
Don't do mean stuff on a bike.

01:10:03.428 --> 01:10:05.672
I mean, perhaps they're fine.

01:10:05.776 --> 01:10:08.192
Yeah, probably not. But that's okay.

01:10:08.295 --> 01:10:12.575
That's all right. You know,
things happen. Let's go.

01:10:14.785 --> 01:10:17.960
- You gonna put it back together?
- It's on loan.

01:10:30.766 --> 01:10:33.079
- Look at me.
- Okay.

01:10:33.976 --> 01:10:36.013
What more can I do, you know?

01:10:36.116 --> 01:10:38.049
You've done so much already, Beth.

01:10:38.153 --> 01:10:41.190
My poor, sweet, little
Nana has lost her sight.

01:10:41.294 --> 01:10:44.021
The book release is
a complete disaster,

01:10:44.124 --> 01:10:45.781
which I've leveraged everything on,

01:10:45.885 --> 01:10:48.232
so I'm probably, most
definitely broke right now.

01:10:48.335 --> 01:10:51.580
And most importantly,
I've lost a writer.

01:10:51.683 --> 01:10:53.237
Who does that? Who loses a writer?

01:10:53.340 --> 01:10:57.862
Okay, Beth, you remind
me of my best friend, Randy.

01:10:57.966 --> 01:11:00.451
Always looking out for other people,

01:11:00.554 --> 01:11:02.902
never taking care of herself.

01:11:03.903 --> 01:11:05.318
Isn't that right, Randy?

01:11:07.838 --> 01:11:09.701
She's like my therapist,
this one over here.

01:11:09.805 --> 01:11:11.911
LOL. "Laughing Out Loud."

01:11:12.014 --> 01:11:13.982
After you take care of your friend,

01:11:14.879 --> 01:11:16.225
how about we go to a beach?

01:11:16.329 --> 01:11:18.814
- What?
- Look, I have a pickup in Hawaii.

01:11:18.918 --> 01:11:20.885
She doesn't have to come.

01:11:20.989 --> 01:11:23.785
Okay! Okay, you can come!

01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:25.890
She's hilarious.

01:11:26.684 --> 01:11:28.513
Let me ask you something.

01:11:28.617 --> 01:11:30.722
We're all sitting here chitchatting,
but who's flying the plane?

01:11:30.826 --> 01:11:32.759
- Autopilot.
- What?

01:11:32.863 --> 01:11:35.589
Sir, go to the cockpit, fly the plane.

01:11:36.038 --> 01:11:37.039
Okay.

01:11:37.799 --> 01:11:39.559
I'm going to go land the plane.

01:11:39.662 --> 01:11:41.112
Okay.

01:11:41.216 --> 01:11:43.114
No, no, no. Take the
goat. Please, take the goat.

01:11:43.218 --> 01:11:45.876
She's on break. Enjoy the flight!

01:12:21.290 --> 01:12:22.636
- Hi.
- Hola.

01:12:27.089 --> 01:12:29.781
This English dude came in
and basically kidnapped her.

01:12:31.922 --> 01:12:35.235
<i>Hey, it's Beth. Please leave a message,
and I'll get right back to you.</i>

01:12:35.339 --> 01:12:38.204
Uh, hi, Beth.

01:12:38.307 --> 01:12:39.308
It's me.

01:12:39.412 --> 01:12:41.241
Uh, I'm alive!

01:12:41.966 --> 01:12:44.003
Uh, listen, um...

01:12:45.314 --> 01:12:46.350
Uh...

01:12:47.799 --> 01:12:51.907
I'm sorry that I blew up the book tour.

01:12:52.011 --> 01:12:53.736
Um...

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:56.222
I was just afraid

01:12:57.361 --> 01:12:59.018
and selfish. Uh...

01:12:59.121 --> 01:13:01.848
Oh, here comes
Alan. I'll call you back.

01:13:05.024 --> 01:13:08.027
So, uh, police are
searching for Fairfax,

01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:10.581
and they're gonna provide
us protection while we're here.

01:13:10.684 --> 01:13:12.514
Did they say how long we'd be here?

01:13:12.617 --> 01:13:15.275
They're gonna try to get us on a
puddle jumper later this evening.

01:13:15.379 --> 01:13:17.588
But, uh, they said in the
meantime, the inn is really nice,

01:13:17.691 --> 01:13:20.280
and we can get cleaned up
and maybe a change of clothes.

01:13:20.384 --> 01:13:21.799
Okay.

01:13:25.251 --> 01:13:26.804
Okay. Yeah.

01:14:19.581 --> 01:14:21.031
Thank you.

01:14:21.617 --> 01:14:24.862
Come on.

01:14:24.966 --> 01:14:26.208
Dance with your husband.

01:14:26.312 --> 01:14:28.107
- No, no, no.
- He's not my husband.

01:14:28.210 --> 01:14:29.936
- It's okay.
- Dance with him.

01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:32.525
No, no. She doesn't want to.
She doesn't have the right shoes.

01:14:32.628 --> 01:14:35.148
Actually, it's the only thing
these shoes are right for.

01:14:35.252 --> 01:14:37.495
You don't have to do this.

01:14:37.599 --> 01:14:39.359
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:40.257 --> 01:14:41.223
Yeah?

01:15:59.853 --> 01:16:01.545
I wonder what she's saying.

01:16:03.926 --> 01:16:05.411
It's folklore.

01:16:06.826 --> 01:16:08.862
Love song about a woman

01:16:08.966 --> 01:16:12.280
whose lover died, and she
didn't want to leave his side.

01:16:13.315 --> 01:16:16.146
So she laid down and refused to get up.

01:16:16.732 --> 01:16:18.493
Must be scary.

01:16:18.596 --> 01:16:22.497
Having to face your future without
the person that you planned it with.

01:16:34.854 --> 01:16:36.407
What was that?

01:16:38.547 --> 01:16:42.206
Excuse me. Excuse me. The,
um... the last line that you sang.

01:16:42.310 --> 01:16:44.657
¿Quién llorará junto a mí?

01:16:47.591 --> 01:16:50.421
"The island will weep for me
in the well of endless tears."

01:16:50.525 --> 01:16:53.907
What is that, the well of endless
tears? Is that a real place, or...

01:16:54.011 --> 01:16:55.633
Sinkhole place.

01:16:57.428 --> 01:16:59.154
Thank you. Gracias, gracias.

01:16:59.258 --> 01:17:01.329
- Come here, come here.
- What is it?

01:17:02.951 --> 01:17:04.780
Hey, on the parchment, it said,

01:17:04.884 --> 01:17:08.957
"King Kalaman and his treasure laid
to rest in the well of endless tears."

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:11.166
I thought maybe it was a metaphor.

01:17:11.684 --> 01:17:13.237
It's not.

01:17:13.341 --> 01:17:16.206
The Well of Endless Tears is a place.

01:17:16.309 --> 01:17:18.311
It's a sinkhole.

01:17:18.415 --> 01:17:20.589
There's a sinkhole on the map.

01:17:21.935 --> 01:17:23.696
I think the tomb is there.

01:17:23.799 --> 01:17:26.181
- This is so much better than your books.
- What?

01:17:26.285 --> 01:17:27.769
There's like... No, I
don't mean any offense.

01:17:27.872 --> 01:17:29.771
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- It's, like, equal.

01:17:29.874 --> 01:17:32.083
- I'm kidding. I'm kidding.
- Look at you. You want to go there.

01:17:32.187 --> 01:17:34.051
- What? No.
- I can see. Yes, you do.

01:17:34.155 --> 01:17:37.261
That would be insane. That
would be insane. I just... I just...

01:17:37.365 --> 01:17:41.748
It's just that we're so close
to it, but, you know, we can't...

01:17:41.852 --> 01:17:43.164
No.

01:17:43.267 --> 01:17:45.959
This is your story. How
do you want to write it?

01:17:46.753 --> 01:17:49.066
I'd like to know that it's there,

01:17:49.170 --> 01:17:50.826
that all this meant something.

01:17:50.930 --> 01:17:52.794
Okay. Then let's go.

01:17:52.897 --> 01:17:54.761
We'll stay one more day.
As soon as the sun's up,

01:17:54.865 --> 01:17:56.625
we're gonna go find the
Well of Endless Tears.

01:17:56.729 --> 01:17:59.594
- But what if it's nothing?
- So what? Then we say we tried.

01:17:59.697 --> 01:18:00.940
And Fairfax?

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:03.460
The cops are after Fairfax.
Don't worry about him.

01:18:04.564 --> 01:18:05.358
This is crazy.

01:18:05.462 --> 01:18:07.153
- Yeah, but look at you.
- What?

01:18:07.257 --> 01:18:10.225
It's the very first time I've
ever seen you totally unafraid.

01:18:10.846 --> 01:18:12.572
And alive.

01:18:12.676 --> 01:18:15.196
I'm gonna go tell them our plans
have changed and find us a ride.

01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:16.749
Where are you going?

01:18:20.408 --> 01:18:22.479
I see you met my friend here.

01:18:22.582 --> 01:18:26.966
He told me you were just
about to jump on a plane,

01:18:27.069 --> 01:18:29.520
without so much as saying goodbye.

01:18:29.624 --> 01:18:33.041
I said, "No way. Not my Loretta.

01:18:33.144 --> 01:18:37.597
Not when she's the only one
who can lead me to the tomb."

01:18:41.014 --> 01:18:43.085
Stop squeezing so hard.

01:18:43.914 --> 01:18:46.710
Ow. Get your hands off of me!

01:18:47.573 --> 01:18:49.437
Ow! Let go!

01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.128
I-I need a car.

01:18:51.232 --> 01:18:53.164
A car, an auto. Does
anybody have an auto?

01:19:01.656 --> 01:19:02.726
No, no. No.

01:19:03.451 --> 01:19:04.762
I-I-I need an auto.

01:19:04.866 --> 01:19:06.212
I'll trade you my watch.

01:19:06.316 --> 01:19:07.731
It's a really expensive
watch. Do you have a car?

01:19:07.834 --> 01:19:09.353
It's a Bulgari. This
thing glows in the dark.

01:19:09.457 --> 01:19:11.252
- It's waterproof.
- I have motorcycle.

01:19:24.851 --> 01:19:26.612
Cool, isn't it?

01:19:26.715 --> 01:19:29.822
I always thought, why can't your
personal tank also have a minibar?

01:19:29.925 --> 01:19:31.410
Have a drink.

01:19:31.513 --> 01:19:33.066
Do you mind?

01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:34.585
Uh, yes.

01:19:34.689 --> 01:19:36.829
He has a bit of a grudge
against you, I'm afraid.

01:19:36.932 --> 01:19:39.728
Something about a motorbike
accident his friends had?

01:19:39.832 --> 01:19:41.005
Why are you doing this?

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:42.869
I want something nobody else has.

01:19:43.767 --> 01:19:45.596
When my father gifted...

01:19:48.668 --> 01:19:50.187
As I was saying,

01:19:50.291 --> 01:19:53.224
when my father gifted his empire

01:19:53.328 --> 01:19:55.779
to my baby brother...

01:20:02.820 --> 01:20:04.339
Who is that?

01:20:13.072 --> 01:20:15.281
Is that a Ken doll on a moped?

01:20:16.075 --> 01:20:17.594
I know him from somewhere.

01:20:17.697 --> 01:20:19.354
Oh, I-I-I doubt that.

01:20:19.458 --> 01:20:21.667
Because what you are looking at

01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:24.670
is a highly trained combat specialist,

01:20:24.773 --> 01:20:28.363
forged in the furnaces
of Afghanistan, Iraq,

01:20:28.467 --> 01:20:31.055
Kuwait, Sa... Sarasota...

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:33.230
Incredible skin. No eczema problems.

01:20:33.334 --> 01:20:37.027
And he will not stop until I am safe!

01:20:37.130 --> 01:20:39.340
So you pull this space tank over,

01:20:39.443 --> 01:20:42.584
unless you would like to
perish like his friends did.

01:20:42.688 --> 01:20:46.105
And he is responsible
for their perishment.

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:48.901
He might not have meant to,

01:20:49.004 --> 01:20:52.283
but they... perished, so...

01:21:07.229 --> 01:21:08.472
Okay, who-who is this?

01:21:08.576 --> 01:21:10.474
I have seen him somewhere before.

01:21:12.959 --> 01:21:14.202
No, no, no.

01:21:14.305 --> 01:21:16.031
That's your cover model, isn't it?

01:21:16.135 --> 01:21:18.413
Yes. I knew I knew him from somewhere.

01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:20.381
Get up there.

01:21:20.484 --> 01:21:21.865
And kill him creatively.

01:21:21.968 --> 01:21:24.074
I love watching hunks fail.

01:21:26.421 --> 01:21:28.665
I guess I-I will have that drink.

01:21:30.356 --> 01:21:31.633
Oh, shit.

01:21:31.737 --> 01:21:34.291
Is it okay if I just top 'er off?

01:21:34.395 --> 01:21:35.568
Yeah, that's fine, but...

01:21:35.672 --> 01:21:37.639
Oh, my God, have you
used a glass before?

01:21:37.743 --> 01:21:39.089
Sorry.

01:21:39.192 --> 01:21:40.677
What would Jack Trainer do?

01:21:42.886 --> 01:21:43.956
It's hot in here.

01:21:44.059 --> 01:21:47.062
Anyone else feeling how hot it is?

01:21:47.166 --> 01:21:48.236
Are you trying to be sexy?

01:21:48.339 --> 01:21:50.134
This is very weird. Please, stop.

01:21:50.238 --> 01:21:52.136
I could set your world on fire.

01:22:02.733 --> 01:22:05.046
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!

01:22:05.149 --> 01:22:06.875
Go to sleep! Sleep!

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:11.121
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:22:11.224 --> 01:22:12.502
Time-out.

01:22:12.605 --> 01:22:13.537
Time-in!

01:22:19.370 --> 01:22:22.201
No! Don't shoot her! I need her!

01:22:23.858 --> 01:22:25.722
Oh, Jesus!

01:22:25.825 --> 01:22:27.240
Ow, ow, ow.

01:22:31.175 --> 01:22:33.592
Move your foot! Move your foot!

01:22:36.664 --> 01:22:38.873
Go to sleep, asshole.

01:22:38.976 --> 01:22:40.633
Get out there! Look!

01:22:45.224 --> 01:22:46.536
A bigger guy?

01:22:46.639 --> 01:22:47.847
Oh, no.

01:22:49.193 --> 01:22:50.436
What?

01:22:52.921 --> 01:22:53.853
Move it!

01:22:55.579 --> 01:22:57.892
No, no, no. No, no, no.

01:22:58.789 --> 01:23:00.688
Hey! Get in.

01:23:01.205 --> 01:23:02.310
Him or me?

01:23:06.417 --> 01:23:11.215
This is not one of your cheap,
vapid lady-fantasy books, Loretta.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:13.286
This is real life.

01:23:14.218 --> 01:23:16.082
And we will kill him.

01:23:16.186 --> 01:23:17.912
Tell us where the tomb is.

01:23:32.582 --> 01:23:33.893
Hi. So, whoever's in charge,

01:23:33.997 --> 01:23:36.620
I need you to send
officials to go here.

01:23:36.724 --> 01:23:37.828
Here.

01:23:38.967 --> 01:23:40.797
We are closed.

01:23:40.900 --> 01:23:42.246
You're closed?

01:23:44.179 --> 01:23:47.286
You know I've been trying to
take a nap for a year and a half?

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:48.943
A year and a half.

01:23:49.875 --> 01:23:52.981
I have been burning
the candle at both ends,

01:23:53.085 --> 01:23:54.431
the midnight oil,

01:23:54.535 --> 01:23:57.503
since way before my
friend got kidnapped.

01:23:57.607 --> 01:23:59.470
And all I want to do

01:24:00.023 --> 01:24:02.163
is kick my feet back

01:24:02.266 --> 01:24:03.509
and drink some wine

01:24:03.613 --> 01:24:05.994
that I'm probably too tired to drink.

01:24:06.098 --> 01:24:08.031
And I want a massage.

01:24:08.134 --> 01:24:12.794
I want someone to massage
my shoulders and my feet,

01:24:12.898 --> 01:24:14.934
and I want it at the same time.

01:24:15.038 --> 01:24:18.731
And I don't care if logistically
that doesn't make sense.

01:24:18.835 --> 01:24:21.492
Because I have worked hard.

01:24:22.355 --> 01:24:24.806
The same way that I know that you have.

01:24:25.704 --> 01:24:27.913
So I hate to ask you

01:24:28.016 --> 01:24:30.398
to leave this place
open a few more minutes,

01:24:30.501 --> 01:24:32.434
because if we don't,

01:24:32.538 --> 01:24:36.093
a very close friend of
mine and her cover model

01:24:36.197 --> 01:24:37.957
are going to die.

01:25:00.808 --> 01:25:02.361
No good way in, boss!

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.605
What about the caves?

01:25:05.364 --> 01:25:06.710
That's too dangerous!

01:25:06.814 --> 01:25:09.817
Well, we'll be very careful then.

01:25:23.382 --> 01:25:24.694
Well, come on!

01:25:29.388 --> 01:25:31.217
- This way.
- I have a rule about

01:25:31.321 --> 01:25:32.840
not going into super creepy caves.

01:25:44.196 --> 01:25:47.130
- Julian?
- His name is Julian?

01:25:47.233 --> 01:25:50.098
He seems more like a Buck or a Bruce.

01:25:50.202 --> 01:25:51.686
Lead the way.

01:25:55.379 --> 01:25:57.761
Go on. Don't be scared.

01:26:27.515 --> 01:26:29.310
Watch your step there.

01:26:29.413 --> 01:26:30.587
Bruce!

01:26:30.691 --> 01:26:31.692
- Julian. Oh, no!
- Julian!

01:26:31.795 --> 01:26:33.417
Whoa.

01:26:33.521 --> 01:26:35.040
Whoa.

01:26:35.696 --> 01:26:37.180
Well...

01:26:38.008 --> 01:26:39.734
Let's not have his death be in vain.

01:26:39.838 --> 01:26:42.599
- Onward and upward.
- What do you mean onward?

01:26:42.703 --> 01:26:45.153
We're not gonna go and
get him now, are we?

01:26:45.257 --> 01:26:46.672
Oh, man.

01:26:59.064 --> 01:27:00.721
- It's nothing.
- Okay.

01:27:00.824 --> 01:27:03.516
Yeah. Look, let's just
go back to the boat.

01:27:03.620 --> 01:27:05.484
This is over. Nobody else has to die.

01:27:05.587 --> 01:27:07.762
No, no, no. Ha-ha! It's a breeze.

01:27:07.866 --> 01:27:10.316
There's a tunnel. This
could lead to the tomb.

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.284
- That's not person-sized.
- Ah, speak for yourself.

01:27:12.387 --> 01:27:14.665
Come on. It's
practically a kiddie slide.

01:27:14.769 --> 01:27:17.082
- More like a rock sphincter.
- Or a troll anus.

01:27:17.185 --> 01:27:19.567
All right, well, you are
going through the anus...

01:27:19.670 --> 01:27:20.982
The hole... the tunnel!

01:27:21.086 --> 01:27:23.088
- Why her?
- You are our canary in the coal mine.

01:27:23.191 --> 01:27:24.606
No, that's impossible. I can't.

01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:26.160
Please let us know if you get through.

01:27:26.263 --> 01:27:28.576
If we don't hear from
you, Fabio's got to die.

01:27:28.679 --> 01:27:30.854
Wait, I'm the damsel in distress?

01:27:31.544 --> 01:27:32.787
It's okay. I'm fine.

01:28:08.823 --> 01:28:11.274
I can't. I'm so sorry. I can't.

01:28:11.377 --> 01:28:13.103
- Hey.
- What?

01:28:13.828 --> 01:28:15.796
Hey, you smell that?

01:28:15.899 --> 01:28:18.833
You mean centuries worth of bat
feces? Yes, I definitely smell that.

01:28:18.937 --> 01:28:21.146
You gotta take a big breath for me.

01:28:26.254 --> 01:28:27.635
There you go.

01:28:27.738 --> 01:28:29.602
You can do it, Loretta.

01:28:42.546 --> 01:28:45.308
I think I see a way out.

01:28:48.863 --> 01:28:51.072
Oh, cheese and rice!

01:28:55.766 --> 01:28:57.113
I made it!

01:28:57.216 --> 01:28:58.700
I made it!

01:28:58.804 --> 01:29:01.289
See? Totally safe.

01:29:02.290 --> 01:29:03.360
Go on. Your turn.

01:29:05.052 --> 01:29:07.951
I'm coming through!
Be right there, okay?

01:30:12.119 --> 01:30:14.259
Why would they build this here?

01:30:15.363 --> 01:30:17.089
But how is anyone supposed to worship

01:30:17.193 --> 01:30:18.884
or remember you if
they can't even see it?

01:30:18.988 --> 01:30:20.851
They aren't.

01:30:20.955 --> 01:30:23.924
This isn't a monument
to Kalaman's power.

01:30:25.028 --> 01:30:27.617
It's a hiding place
for a grieving woman.

01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:31.172
Taha came here to
be with her fallen lover.

01:30:32.829 --> 01:30:34.279
She just wanted to be alone.

01:30:35.936 --> 01:30:37.454
Taha doesn't want us here.

01:30:37.558 --> 01:30:38.904
God, shut up, Rafi.

01:30:39.008 --> 01:30:40.871
It's just the volcano.

01:30:42.528 --> 01:30:43.840
Come on.

01:30:48.983 --> 01:30:50.640
We have to keep going.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.477
All right. Let's go, Muscles.

01:31:01.271 --> 01:31:03.101
Open it up.

01:31:03.204 --> 01:31:05.655
- Don't disturb them.
- She will be wearing the headdress.

01:31:05.758 --> 01:31:08.347
Come on. We didn't come all
this way just to pay our respects.

01:31:08.451 --> 01:31:10.108
I can't, um...

01:31:12.869 --> 01:31:15.078
- Uh...
- I'm sorry, abuela.

01:31:36.306 --> 01:31:37.618
What is that?

01:31:39.758 --> 01:31:42.174
Are those... seashells?

01:31:42.933 --> 01:31:45.798
The crown is made of seashells?

01:31:45.902 --> 01:31:47.455
Where's the treasure?

01:31:48.456 --> 01:31:49.906
She's holding him.

01:31:52.702 --> 01:31:54.462
You mean the dead guy?

01:32:00.986 --> 01:32:02.194
Look.

01:32:04.196 --> 01:32:05.922
It's their courtship.

01:32:06.026 --> 01:32:09.926
Kalaman is searching
the island for something.

01:32:12.756 --> 01:32:14.344
Rare red seashells.

01:32:14.448 --> 01:32:19.453
To prove his love, he gave her
one shell every day for a year

01:32:19.556 --> 01:32:21.110
and made them into a crown,

01:32:21.213 --> 01:32:24.009
bright red like the
flame of their love,

01:32:24.113 --> 01:32:27.495
until the day came where
she accepted his proposal.

01:32:27.599 --> 01:32:29.359
It was never about jewels.

01:32:29.463 --> 01:32:33.191
Kalaman and Taha's
riches weren't material.

01:32:35.124 --> 01:32:37.057
It was their love.

01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:39.507
That's what it meant. That was enough.

01:32:39.611 --> 01:32:40.819
So that's it?

01:32:41.716 --> 01:32:44.616
All of that time and money

01:32:45.444 --> 01:32:49.034
spent on, what, just a cheap metaphor?

01:32:49.138 --> 01:32:51.933
- It's a pretty rich metaphor.
- Oh, shut up!

01:32:52.037 --> 01:32:54.074
We got to go. We got to go now.

01:32:54.177 --> 01:32:57.353
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, no, no. You are staying here.

01:32:57.456 --> 01:32:59.527
You think it's all so sweet and poetic.

01:32:59.631 --> 01:33:02.116
Well, then you can stay here
and spend your last moments

01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:05.154
pondering the richness
of that metaphor.

01:33:05.844 --> 01:33:08.122
- Get in.
- What? Come on, man.

01:33:08.226 --> 01:33:10.676
- Oh, God. Just get in. Get in the tomb.
- Okay, okay.

01:33:10.780 --> 01:33:13.403
It's better to be buried alive
than buried dead, I guess.

01:33:13.507 --> 01:33:16.786
- It's really not.
- You know, it is a shame, really.

01:33:16.889 --> 01:33:18.408
This is a hell of a story.

01:33:18.512 --> 01:33:21.204
Pity you won't be around
to tell it. Come on.

01:33:21.308 --> 01:33:22.895
- But they'll die.
- So will you

01:33:22.999 --> 01:33:25.588
if you don't stop being such
a snowflake! Get over here!

01:33:35.184 --> 01:33:37.186
This is fine. This is not
an active nightmare

01:33:37.289 --> 01:33:38.946
I've had since I was 14 years old.

01:33:40.706 --> 01:33:42.191
Ow!

01:33:42.294 --> 01:33:46.022
Why are you going
so fast? It's not a race.

01:33:51.027 --> 01:33:53.340
Wait, no! What are you
doing? Come back here!

01:33:53.443 --> 01:33:58.138
You may have bought the island,
but now the island owns you!

01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:00.485
You can't just leave me here!

01:34:02.521 --> 01:34:04.903
Rafi! Come back!

01:34:07.077 --> 01:34:08.493
I need a boat!

01:34:17.916 --> 01:34:20.021
Hey, hey, stop! Stop!

01:34:22.023 --> 01:34:23.887
Help! Help!

01:34:23.991 --> 01:34:26.096
One of the locals just stole my boat!

01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:27.960
Have you seen a woman?

01:34:28.064 --> 01:34:31.171
She's a brunette in
a sequined jumpsuit.

01:34:31.274 --> 01:34:35.278
No. Is she in some sort of trouble?

01:34:46.945 --> 01:34:48.671
It's kind of funny.

01:34:50.086 --> 01:34:51.881
I used to think this...

01:34:51.984 --> 01:34:53.883
this sort of thing was so romantic.

01:34:53.986 --> 01:34:55.367
Yeah?

01:34:55.471 --> 01:34:58.819
Being locked in a coffin
about to be buried by lava,

01:34:58.922 --> 01:35:01.511
or... cuddling dead people?

01:35:02.305 --> 01:35:05.377
Just laying down with a lost love.

01:35:05.481 --> 01:35:06.689
Like Taha did.

01:35:09.243 --> 01:35:10.451
God.Oh...

01:35:11.038 --> 01:35:12.419
Oh, God.

01:35:12.522 --> 01:35:14.731
I'm sorry.

01:35:14.835 --> 01:35:17.286
I'm sorry that I couldn't save you.

01:35:17.389 --> 01:35:19.357
I'm sorry I couldn't be Dash.

01:35:19.943 --> 01:35:21.221
You're right.

01:35:22.256 --> 01:35:23.809
You're nothing like Dash.

01:35:23.913 --> 01:35:26.950
You didn't ride in on a
white horse to save me.

01:35:27.054 --> 01:35:32.439
You rode in on a... borrowed
scooter with a broken muffler.

01:35:33.819 --> 01:35:35.235
Yeah.

01:35:35.338 --> 01:35:38.238
I never could've
written a Dash like you.

01:35:40.136 --> 01:35:42.069
'Cause I never knew

01:35:42.759 --> 01:35:44.554
a Dash like Alan.

01:35:44.658 --> 01:35:47.108
I was so afraid of
being hurt by life again

01:35:47.212 --> 01:35:48.593
that I just stopped living.

01:35:48.696 --> 01:35:50.698
Couldn't see the good
things in front of me.

01:35:50.802 --> 01:35:54.288
I'm just so sorry I
didn't see you sooner.

01:35:55.255 --> 01:35:56.980
I have a confession too.

01:35:57.084 --> 01:36:00.984
See, I was really liking where
this new story of ours was headed.

01:36:01.088 --> 01:36:04.298
I just wanted to see how it
was gonna turn out, I guess.

01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:08.164
The Adventures of Loretta and Alan.

01:36:10.270 --> 01:36:12.202
No, it would need a
better title than that.

01:36:12.306 --> 01:36:14.274
Yeah, definitely. Definitely.

01:36:15.413 --> 01:36:19.209
Sorry. Just... Taha's
femur is poking me.

01:36:22.903 --> 01:36:24.663
Rafi must have left that.

01:36:24.767 --> 01:36:27.287
How do you forget your
crowbar? It's gonna help us escape.

01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:29.012
No, he left it on purpose.

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:30.807
Oh, cool. I always liked him.

01:36:30.911 --> 01:36:32.326
- One...
- Okay.

01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:34.259
- ...two, three!
- Okay.

01:36:34.363 --> 01:36:38.298
I would've preferred him to not leave
us here in the first place, but...

01:36:38.988 --> 01:36:39.816
Okay.

01:37:00.872 --> 01:37:03.081
Dulcius ex asperis.

01:37:07.430 --> 01:37:09.329
Sweeter after difficulty.

01:37:15.956 --> 01:37:17.406
Go up! Run for the trees!

01:37:18.614 --> 01:37:21.513
Wait. Nope. Never
mind. Trees are on fire.

01:37:21.962 --> 01:37:23.653
Okay.

01:37:25.241 --> 01:37:27.105
We can go back through the tunnel.

01:37:28.071 --> 01:37:29.349
Nope. Tunnel's a no-go.

01:37:34.457 --> 01:37:36.425
Um, okay. I'm open to other ideas.

01:37:36.528 --> 01:37:40.083
There's a current. We
can follow it into the ocean.

01:37:40.187 --> 01:37:41.809
How do we know
what's on the other side?

01:37:42.327 --> 01:37:43.397
We don't.

01:37:45.226 --> 01:37:47.367
There's only one way to find out.

01:37:48.920 --> 01:37:50.577
- Worth the rash.
- Yeah?

01:38:11.563 --> 01:38:12.564
Alan?

01:38:21.021 --> 01:38:22.263
Alan!

01:38:59.715 --> 01:39:00.716
Alan?

01:39:00.819 --> 01:39:03.512
A... Alan?

01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:05.721
Alan!

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.726
Oh, my God! You're alive!

01:39:10.829 --> 01:39:13.073
- I'm alive.
- Oh, my God. I thought I killed you.

01:39:16.041 --> 01:39:17.008
Is that Beth?

01:39:17.111 --> 01:39:18.354
Loretta!

01:39:18.975 --> 01:39:20.149
Beth!

01:39:20.252 --> 01:39:21.909
Beth! Beth!

01:39:22.013 --> 01:39:23.255
Beth!

01:39:28.916 --> 01:39:30.297
Beth, you're here!

01:39:30.953 --> 01:39:32.161
Why are you here?

01:39:32.264 --> 01:39:35.060
I told you I got your back, girl!

01:39:35.647 --> 01:39:37.442
I'm so sorry!

01:39:37.546 --> 01:39:39.651
I destroyed the jumpsuit!

01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:41.101
What?

01:39:41.204 --> 01:39:43.724
Never mind! Later.

01:39:43.828 --> 01:39:45.830
I found a British guy in a cave.

01:39:45.933 --> 01:39:48.418
I thought he was a little
boy, but he has a full beard.

01:39:48.522 --> 01:39:51.801
Beth, that's Fairfax! He kidnapped us!

01:39:51.905 --> 01:39:54.666
He's a bad guy, Beth!
He killed my trainer!

01:39:54.770 --> 01:39:55.771
Get him!

01:39:56.288 --> 01:39:57.462
Stop him!

01:40:05.297 --> 01:40:07.507
I got your back, girl.

01:40:09.647 --> 01:40:11.614
Where were you running? It's a boat.

01:40:11.718 --> 01:40:13.236
This guy's hilarious.

01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.066
Got you.

01:40:15.169 --> 01:40:16.446
Swim over to the rock!

01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:18.621
- I don't got you. No, I got you.
- I got you.

01:40:18.725 --> 01:40:20.623
We're gonna get you.
It's gonna be okay.

01:40:20.727 --> 01:40:23.315
<i>"Finding refuge on a nearby rock,</i>

01:40:23.419 --> 01:40:25.525
<i>he lifted her from the water,</i>

01:40:25.628 --> 01:40:28.804
<i>his powerful arms
pulling her body close.</i>

01:40:28.907 --> 01:40:30.046
<i>Alan whispered..."</i>

01:40:30.150 --> 01:40:32.704
<i>Shh. You're safe now.</i>

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.780
<i>"In that moment, Loretta could feel
a new adventure was just beginning."</i>

01:40:41.057 --> 01:40:43.715
"The heart-pounding passion
of the narrow escape

01:40:43.819 --> 01:40:46.753
only inflamed Loretta's desire for him.

01:40:46.856 --> 01:40:51.067
She was thirsty for the hot lava
soon to be pulsing from his..."

01:40:51.171 --> 01:40:54.761
Don't you go stopping
right at the good part.

01:40:56.107 --> 01:40:57.936
It's nothing she hasn't read before.

01:40:58.040 --> 01:40:59.420
Didn't I tell you?

01:40:59.524 --> 01:41:02.527
The most beautiful beach in the world.

01:41:02.631 --> 01:41:05.944
Maybe later, I'll show you
the Cove of Enchantment?

01:41:06.048 --> 01:41:07.636
No, you can take Randy.

01:41:07.739 --> 01:41:11.398
Remember, you are
my platonic man friend.

01:41:11.501 --> 01:41:14.539
Platonic? I like the sound of that.

01:41:14.643 --> 01:41:17.300
Not sure what it means,
but I like the sound of it.

01:41:17.404 --> 01:41:19.613
Here you go, Randy.

01:41:21.373 --> 01:41:23.686
- My dear.
- You are an angel. Thank you.

01:41:24.342 --> 01:41:25.757
How did you know?

01:41:37.666 --> 01:41:40.461
- Nice way to end a book tour, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:41:41.014 --> 01:41:42.843
Um...

01:41:42.947 --> 01:41:47.192
You know, I have a phrase I like to
use in moments like these, actually.

01:41:47.296 --> 01:41:48.538
Um...

01:41:50.023 --> 01:41:51.438
Quid deinde?

01:41:52.577 --> 01:41:55.753
It's Latin. It means,
uh, "What's next?"

01:41:57.651 --> 01:41:59.170
Quid cogitas?

01:41:59.273 --> 01:42:00.654
Mmm.

01:42:01.379 --> 01:42:02.552
Buca di Beppo.

01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:07.627
- Yeah. I know zero other Latin.
- No. Yes.

01:42:07.730 --> 01:42:10.664
I looked it up for this
moment right now.

01:42:11.492 --> 01:42:13.633
So, what does come next?

01:42:13.736 --> 01:42:16.221
- How would you write this?
- I don't know.

01:42:16.325 --> 01:42:18.879
- How would you write it?
- Do we really want me to write this?

01:42:18.983 --> 01:42:21.330
- Just try. Take a stab at it.
- Okay. I'll write it.

01:42:21.433 --> 01:42:22.780
Okay.

01:42:22.883 --> 01:42:25.886
"We were... They were,
uh... standing on a beach."

01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:27.923
Sets the stage for the audience.
They know where we are.

01:42:28.026 --> 01:42:29.821
You're already laughing.
Why are you laughing at me?

01:42:29.925 --> 01:42:31.720
- I'm not laughing. I'm smiling.
- You are.

01:42:31.823 --> 01:42:35.827
"There are palm trees above a brown

01:42:36.690 --> 01:42:39.313
bark-like hair of the maiden.

01:42:39.417 --> 01:42:41.281
"There is a dead jellyfish..."

01:42:41.384 --> 01:42:43.835
All you're doing is describing what
you're actually seeing right now.

01:42:43.939 --> 01:42:46.769
"He's nervous because
he really likes her."

01:42:47.632 --> 01:42:49.669
It's nice writing.

01:42:49.772 --> 01:42:51.084
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:42:51.187 --> 01:42:52.292
I'll keep going.

01:42:52.395 --> 01:42:53.983
"He looked deep in her eyes."

01:42:54.087 --> 01:42:57.538
The only thing that could compare
to the pulse of that ocean

01:42:58.332 --> 01:42:59.402
"was the throbbing in the..."

01:42:59.506 --> 01:43:02.612
- Okay, no, you can't throb.
- Why not?

01:43:02.716 --> 01:43:04.442
Can't come out of
the gate with a throb.

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:06.858
- You throb all the time.
- I don't come out of the gate with it.

01:43:06.962 --> 01:43:08.860
- You have to earn the throb.
- Who made you the queen of throb?

01:43:08.964 --> 01:43:12.657
It's usually a chapter four thing. You
want it brought up appropriately in four.

01:43:12.761 --> 01:43:14.866
I think you throb in all
the chapters. "Pulsating."

01:43:14.970 --> 01:43:16.903
It's a precursor to throb.

01:43:17.006 --> 01:43:19.112
- "Undulating."
- You just jumped to five.

01:43:19.215 --> 01:43:22.080
- How 'bout they just kiss? Why not?
- Just like a regular kiss?

01:43:22.184 --> 01:43:24.048
Yeah. Like a
beginning-of-the-chapter kiss.

01:43:24.151 --> 01:43:25.739
I'm good at starting...

01:43:29.605 --> 01:43:31.089
How was that? Any notes?

01:43:31.849 --> 01:43:35.231
Very good first chapter attempt.

01:45:00.489 --> 01:45:01.973
Psst!

01:45:02.629 --> 01:45:04.113
Psst.

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:06.081
Psst.

01:45:08.152 --> 01:45:09.118
Mother...

01:45:09.222 --> 01:45:10.948
You were dead.

01:45:11.051 --> 01:45:13.916
Your brains came out of your
face and hit the back of my throat.

01:45:14.020 --> 01:45:16.574
- He was in my mouth.
- Don't say he was in your mouth.

01:45:16.677 --> 01:45:18.300
- I could taste you.
- Don't ever say that.

01:45:18.403 --> 01:45:23.581
We only use 10% of our brain,
so I just switched to another 10%.

01:45:23.684 --> 01:45:26.515
So, you're okay?

01:45:26.618 --> 01:45:28.310
One hundred percent.

01:45:28.413 --> 01:45:29.898
Meaning 10%.

01:45:30.001 --> 01:45:31.761
We thought you were dead.

01:45:31.865 --> 01:45:34.592
Naturally, I have some anger
issues I need to let go of.

01:45:34.695 --> 01:45:37.043
- Of course.
- And resentment.

01:45:38.941 --> 01:45:40.287
So good to see you, man.

01:45:40.391 --> 01:45:42.462
Okay, let's keep the chatter down.

01:45:42.565 --> 01:45:46.949
We're closing our eyes and
reconnecting to our breath.

01:45:48.019 --> 01:45:49.124
Great.

01:45:49.952 --> 01:45:50.953
Great.
