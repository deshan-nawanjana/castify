1
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.570
Oh!

2
00:00:44.578 --> 00:00:46.876
Ow!

3
00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.044
Help! Help!

4
00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.346
Am I dead?

5
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.014
You're not dead.

6
00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.455
You've been taken
against your will.

7
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.425
Kobe? Who is that?

8
00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:08.066
Dr. Phil?
What the hell's going on?

9
00:01:08.134 --> 00:01:11.831
I don't know. I was doing a show
on teens with abandonment issues...

10
00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:13.634
and suddenly, I woke up here.

11
00:01:13.707 --> 00:01:16.801
Man, those kids
are gonna be pissed.

12
00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.736
Hello, gentlemen.

13
00:01:19.813 --> 00:01:22.373
You don't know me,
but I know you.

14
00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:25.680
You both play games
with other people for a living...

15
00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.653
but, today, you play a game
for your lives.

16
00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:32.590
Right now, you are both
breathing in a deadly nerve gas.

17
00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.628
You have 120 seconds to reach
the antidote...

18
00:01:35.695 --> 00:01:36.992
or you die.

19
00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.088
Oh, my God!
We better get out of here!

20
00:01:39.165 --> 00:01:41.258
Let the game begin.

21
00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:44.267
There!

22
00:01:51.077 --> 00:01:54.012
Hit the metal arm
with something.

23
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.672
There.

24
00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.918
Damn it!

25
00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.523
Sorry.

26
00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:13.930
Shaquille, I'm not angry at you...

27
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.833
but we are one minute
away from death.

28
00:02:16.903 --> 00:02:19.303
Just shut out the "No" voice.

29
00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.806
Own your success.

30
00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:26.639
Oh!

31
00:02:28.081 --> 00:02:31.380
Just make the damn basket!

32
00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.781
What the hell was that for?

33
00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.550
You hurt my feelings.

34
00:02:37.624 --> 00:02:40.684
Your feelings?
To hell with your feelings!

35
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.887
Everybody with their feelings!

36
00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:45.989
"I'm obese."
"My kid's a brat." "Help me. Help me."

37
00:02:46.066 --> 00:02:47.328
Just shut up!

38
00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.391
Why can't I fix anyone?

39
00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:53.929
I'm so dumb and worthless!
Mama was right! Mama was right!

40
00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:57.704
Hey, hey! Pull yourself together.
You're a brilliant doctor.

41
00:02:57.777 --> 00:02:59.802
Not exactly.

42
00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.009
- What?
- I-I just tell people to "get real."

43
00:03:04.084 --> 00:03:06.518
I'm not even a psychologist.

44
00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:08.315
I'm... an electrician.

45
00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:12.822
I failed you, Shaq.
I failed you.

46
00:03:21.134 --> 00:03:22.692
- Booyah!
- Yes!

47
00:03:26.072 --> 00:03:27.664
30 seconds left!

48
00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:32.945
This will never work.

49
00:03:33.013 --> 00:03:36.073
Of course- he wants us
to cut through our feet.

50
00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.184
You go first.

51
00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:41.550
Bullshit.

52
00:03:41.621 --> 00:03:43.555
Yeah.

53
00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:45.614
You're probably not man enough.

54
00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.387
I guess your mama was right.

55
00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:51.187
Never!

56
00:03:51.264 --> 00:03:54.597
Who's the coward now, Mama?

57
00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.601
Candy from a baby.

58
00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.798
- Oh, my God!
- I did it. We're saved.

59
00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:06.437
- What's wrong?
- Wrong foot.

60
00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:12.244
Motherfu-

61
00:04:24.798 --> 00:04:26.561
No one believed

62
00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:29.363
in the early years
of the 21st century

63
00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:31.461
that our world was being
watched...

64
00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:35.440
the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize the creatures

65
00:04:35.508 --> 00:04:37.271
in a drop of water.

66
00:04:57.931 --> 00:05:00.923
Yet across the gulf of space

67
00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.561
a terrible evil prepared
to unleash itself

68
00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:08.539
upon an unsuspecting human race.

69
00:05:20.954 --> 00:05:23.889
You're up early.
Come back to bed.

70
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:27.557
Come on.

71
00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.890
Please.

72
00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:54.376
Hello? Hello?

73
00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:58.189
Tom! Oh!

74
00:06:00.093 --> 00:06:03.927
I know you missed me.
Oh, I missed you too. God, you look great.

75
00:06:03.997 --> 00:06:06.488
I wanted to come by to thank you
for setting up that job interview for me.

76
00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:10.093
This isn't a good time.

77
00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:12.730
I just need something to keep me busy
now that Cody's out of the house.

78
00:06:12.805 --> 00:06:14.773
He just turned 11.

79
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:16.570
I enrolled him in military
school last year.

80
00:06:16.643 --> 00:06:18.907
It's supposed to be
a great program.

81
00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:22.038
Boy, kids, you know,
they just grow up so fast.

82
00:06:22.115 --> 00:06:24.583
So I heard
that you were dating again.

83
00:06:24.651 --> 00:06:26.881
Knowing you,
I bet she's brainy.

84
00:06:26.953 --> 00:06:28.443
"Quixotic."

85
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:30.148
90 points!

86
00:06:43.736 --> 00:06:46.864
Oh, you know, your work with
the elderly really inspired me, Tom.

87
00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:50.569
I mean, they have
so much to teach us...

88
00:06:50.643 --> 00:06:52.770
and we have so much
to teach them.

89
00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.780
You know, ultimately, they...
really are just like us...

90
00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:58.408
only... older.

91
00:06:58.484 --> 00:07:01.976
Anyway, I'm hoping that
a new career will help

92
00:07:02.055 --> 00:07:05.582
keep my mind off of...
bad memories.

93
00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:09.822
I'm sure you have memories, too.
He's the kind of person you never forget.

94
00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.921
Sometimes, I wake up in
the middle of the night

95
00:07:11.998 --> 00:07:14.728
wondering where he is,
and then I remember.

96
00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:19.261
I know you miss him, too,
but it's really been hardest on me.

97
00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:21.307
I'm rattling on, but if you
don't vent your emotions...

98
00:07:21.374 --> 00:07:25.037
they just well up inside of you
and burst out.

99
00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:27.841
The harder you try,
the harder it all gets...

100
00:07:27.914 --> 00:07:30.212
till you just can't
shake it off anymore.

101
00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:31.272
Oh!

102
00:07:31.351 --> 00:07:34.343
Like you're carrying around
this enormous burden.

103
00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.445
Sometimes your problems
get so big.

104
00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:41.827
- And then what do you say to yourself?
- Jesus!

105
00:07:41.894 --> 00:07:45.295
Yes, you can turn to religion
or family and friends...

106
00:07:45.365 --> 00:07:47.959
but in the end,
you're still in agony.

107
00:07:48.034 --> 00:07:50.525
Maybe that's why
I want to become a nurse.

108
00:07:50.603 --> 00:07:54.505
I'm just- I'm so in tune
with everyone's emotions.

109
00:07:54.574 --> 00:07:57.304
I guess I've always had
a knack for being-

110
00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.975
Oh, my-

111
00:08:26.406 --> 00:08:29.705
Ryan, go home.
You've been working 16 straight hours.

112
00:08:29.776 --> 00:08:32.040
Come on, I need the overtime.

113
00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:34.011
Don't worry. Okay?

114
00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.548
I'm wide-

115
00:08:38.651 --> 00:08:43.088
Ryan! What are you doing?

116
00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:46.957
That was gold bullion-

117
00:08:49.095 --> 00:08:51.086
No, not the monkeys!

118
00:08:56.402 --> 00:08:58.870
They're loose!

119
00:09:03.142 --> 00:09:05.474
Damn it, Tom!
What the hell happened back there?

120
00:09:05.545 --> 00:09:07.638
Aw, come on, Ed.
That could've happened to anyone.

121
00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:10.308
Oh, yeah?
You know what your problem is?

122
00:09:10.383 --> 00:09:13.443
As soon as the going gets tough,
you give up.

123
00:09:13.519 --> 00:09:15.885
You're right. I quit.

124
00:09:15.955 --> 00:09:17.616
Ah, you don't get it, do you?

125
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.659
You could be the best,
if only you'd see things through.

126
00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.218
- I don't know.
- Give me a break.

127
00:09:23.296 --> 00:09:26.424
What can I tell you, Ed?
I guess I'm no good.

128
00:09:26.499 --> 00:09:28.228
Maybe I just don't have what it takes.

129
00:09:28.301 --> 00:09:32.203
What are you talking about?
You secured that tricky H-500 unit, didn't you?

130
00:09:32.271 --> 00:09:34.068
Aw, come on. That was easy.

131
00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:44.782
Tom Ryan.
I haven't seen you in a while.

132
00:09:44.851 --> 00:09:49.049
Well, I spend every waking minute
of my life operating a crane.

133
00:09:49.122 --> 00:09:51.113
God, I hate my job.

134
00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.887
Yo, Tom! Where you been?

135
00:09:57.964 --> 00:09:59.454
Mahalik.

136
00:09:59.532 --> 00:10:01.363
Yo, C.J.,
this is my boy Tom Ryan.

137
00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:03.595
We used to work together
down at the docks.

138
00:10:03.669 --> 00:10:04.829
Ya-hi! Ya-hi! Ya-hi!

139
00:10:04.904 --> 00:10:07.566
- Hey, Tom. How's the family, man?
- You remember Marilyn?

140
00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:10.165
- Your lovely wife- how could I forget?
- She dumped me.

141
00:10:10.243 --> 00:10:13.178
Yeah, I know.
I slept with her a few times.

142
00:10:13.246 --> 00:10:14.679
- What?
- Me too.

143
00:10:14.747 --> 00:10:17.773
You guys talking about Marilyn?
Great lay.

144
00:10:17.850 --> 00:10:20.114
My pops introduced me to her.

145
00:10:20.186 --> 00:10:22.211
Ever since the divorce,
it's like my life has no purpose.

146
00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.085
Half the time I walk around
feeling like a zombie.

147
00:10:24.157 --> 00:10:26.523
Yo, don't joke about zombies.
That shit there- that's real.

148
00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:29.026
Yo, you know Nashawn,
down on 120th Street?

149
00:10:29.095 --> 00:10:30.084
Yeah.

150
00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:32.927
She told me that she heard a zombie
going through her trash the other day.

151
00:10:32.999 --> 00:10:34.830
The next morning,
she turned up missing.

152
00:10:34.901 --> 00:10:37.028
- Uh-
- What? Okay, back up.

153
00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:39.037
How in the hell
do you "turn up missing"?

154
00:10:39.105 --> 00:10:41.801
'Cause nobody knows where you are
when they realize you ain't there!

155
00:10:41.874 --> 00:10:43.136
Guys, I'm trying to ask-

156
00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:46.303
So you telling me that you can appear
and disappear at the same time.

157
00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:48.904
No, man. You can't appear
and disappear at the same time.

158
00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:51.006
- The bitch ain't David Copperfield!
- Uh, guys-

159
00:10:51.083 --> 00:10:52.482
Mmm. No, no.

160
00:10:52.552 --> 00:10:54.986
But you can't be gone from one place
and show up somewhere else entirely.

161
00:10:55.054 --> 00:10:57.045
So when you turn up,
you're never missing.

162
00:10:57.123 --> 00:10:59.489
And when you're missing,
you never turn up.

163
00:10:59.559 --> 00:11:02.187
Unless... you a zombie.

164
00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:03.694
Damn!

165
00:11:03.763 --> 00:11:06.698
Hey, that's some plausible shit right there.
You should blog about that.

166
00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:09.667
- I'm gonna put that on MySpace.
- You do that!

167
00:11:09.735 --> 00:11:11.396
Hey, Tom.

168
00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:14.497
You know what you need to do, man?
You need to get away from all this.

169
00:11:14.574 --> 00:11:17.475
- You need to take a break.
- Oh, I don't know.

170
00:11:17.543 --> 00:11:21.035
No, no. He's right, man. You should
come fishing with us one weekend.

171
00:11:21.113 --> 00:11:24.082
Me and Mahalik, we found
this great spot last summer.

172
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:26.482
Yeah. A great spot.

173
00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.091
Hey. You cold?

174
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:40.060
- L-Little bit.
- Hmm.

175
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:50.238
Hey. Look, man, um-

176
00:11:50.309 --> 00:11:52.174
I'm not on the down-low
or nothing, all right?

177
00:11:52.245 --> 00:11:55.681
Oh, that's cool, man.
Me, neither.

178
00:11:58.985 --> 00:12:01.249
- Hey, what you doing?
- Relax, man.

179
00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.754
I'm just trying to grab some nuts.

180
00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:13.554
C.J., what are you doin'?

181
00:12:13.633 --> 00:12:16.261
- I just wanna eat some peanuts.
- Huh?

182
00:12:16.335 --> 00:12:19.668
See? Peanuts.

183
00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.191
Ooh, baby.

184
00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:35.038
Yeah...
we caught a lot of fish.

185
00:13:35.114 --> 00:13:36.604
Yeah.

186
00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:40.115
Black cod.

187
00:13:40.186 --> 00:13:42.279
Damn.

188
00:13:42.355 --> 00:13:45.256
Tom, you don't-
I don't want you thinking that-

189
00:13:45.324 --> 00:13:47.155
Hopefully, this doesn't
affect your opin-

190
00:13:47.226 --> 00:13:49.524
Why would you do that,
and that's my first time meeting him?

191
00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:04.072
Late again, Tom.

192
00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:07.340
- Hey, Marilyn.
- I thought you were moving.

193
00:14:07.413 --> 00:14:11.315
It's all I can afford right now. You took
everything in the divorce except my name.

194
00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:13.648
No, actually, the judge
granted me that yesterday.

195
00:14:13.719 --> 00:14:16.017
You're now officially known
as "Horace P. MacTitties."

196
00:14:17.256 --> 00:14:20.157
I'm sure your new husband is pleased.

197
00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:22.888
He's a good man.
A provider, unlike you.

198
00:14:22.962 --> 00:14:24.793
You never cared
about our children.

199
00:14:24.864 --> 00:14:27.355
Hey, that's not true.
I'm a great dad.

200
00:14:27.433 --> 00:14:29.901
Kids!

201
00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:30.993
Dad?

202
00:14:37.143 --> 00:14:39.008
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Rachel.

203
00:14:39.078 --> 00:14:41.842
How's it going there,
uh... Princess?

204
00:14:42.848 --> 00:14:44.713
It's locked.

205
00:14:47.953 --> 00:14:49.477
Hey! Let me help you
with that, muffin.

206
00:14:49.555 --> 00:14:51.045
- I should do that.
- It's no problem.

207
00:14:51.123 --> 00:14:53.114
- I honestly don't mind.
- Neither do I.

208
00:14:53.192 --> 00:14:55.057
Fine. You take it.

209
00:14:55.127 --> 00:14:57.527
I'll see you on Tuesday.

210
00:14:57.596 --> 00:14:58.927
Hey, Marilyn.

211
00:14:58.998 --> 00:15:02.229
That's a good look for you,
being pregnant.

212
00:15:03.636 --> 00:15:05.900
I'm not pregnant!

213
00:15:05.971 --> 00:15:08.963
I didn't meant to-
I'm sorry.

214
00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.908
If you want to make things right,
maybe you should start with our kids.

215
00:15:11.977 --> 00:15:14.912
You're right. Those kids
are all I have in this world.

216
00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.642
Well, the kids... and my car.

217
00:15:17.717 --> 00:15:20.379
Ow!

218
00:15:23.022 --> 00:15:27.049
Mr. Koji, looks like we need
someone new for the Norris account.

219
00:15:27.126 --> 00:15:28.616
Again?

220
00:15:28.694 --> 00:15:31.754
Every day we don't have someone looking
after this woman, I lose big money.

221
00:15:31.831 --> 00:15:35.289
- What happened to last girl?
- Yoko. Take a look.

222
00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:37.801
Holy shit!

223
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:40.464
Someone put a towel under her
or something. Christ!

224
00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:44.441
It's the Norris house, Mr. Koji.
They say it's cursed.

225
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:46.501
There no such thing as a curse.

226
00:15:46.579 --> 00:15:48.240
Don't be ridiculous.

227
00:15:48.314 --> 00:15:50.680
Those just old wives' tales.

228
00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:54.413
I need someone there today
or I'm in big trouble.

229
00:15:57.423 --> 00:15:59.414
Hello. I'm Cindy Campbell.

230
00:15:59.492 --> 00:16:01.756
I'm looking for a job
in home health care.

231
00:16:03.195 --> 00:16:05.686
I was recommended by a family friend,
but unfortunately, he committed-

232
00:16:05.765 --> 00:16:08.529
Oh, my God!

233
00:16:08.601 --> 00:16:10.660
Don't mind her.
She slip and fall.

234
00:16:10.736 --> 00:16:14.035
You my new best employee.
Ready start today?

235
00:16:14.106 --> 00:16:16.040
Oh, it's so fast. I don't know.

236
00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:18.372
Oh, trust me.
Uh, you're gonna love this job.

237
00:16:18.444 --> 00:16:20.878
Come on, I show you.
We can be there 10 minutes.

238
00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.059
Come! Come!

239
00:16:45.704 --> 00:16:48.400
Mr. Koji?

240
00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:53.507
Hello?

241
00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:05.854
Oh, my God! Oh!

242
00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:07.256
Okay, oh.

243
00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:09.692
- Oh, let's get you up and-
- Oh!

244
00:17:09.762 --> 00:17:12.356
Okay, come on.
Here we go.

245
00:17:12.431 --> 00:17:15.059
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- There you are.

246
00:17:15.134 --> 00:17:16.931
I see you've met Mrs. Norris-
she catatonic.

247
00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:19.470
Yes, I was just trying
to get her back up on the bed.

248
00:17:19.538 --> 00:17:21.597
I was afraid
that she would be hurt.

249
00:17:21.674 --> 00:17:23.869
You know, when I came in,
I just saw her lying here on the floor.

250
00:17:23.943 --> 00:17:26.673
Of course, of course. I help.
You grab her legs, I grab her arms.

251
00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:29.043
Mrs. Norris,
I'm here to take care of you.

252
00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:32.943
Yes, I'm very happy
to meet you, too.

253
00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:38.021
See? This job perfect for you.
Let me show you rest of house.

254
00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.183
Right this way.

255
00:17:40.259 --> 00:17:42.227
So, what do you think?

256
00:17:42.294 --> 00:17:48.199
I don't know. There's something
strange about this house.

257
00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:51.031
- A presence.
- A presence? Don't be silly.

258
00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:52.866
- Nothing wrong with this house.
- It's funny.

259
00:17:52.938 --> 00:17:56.374
I always dreamt I would live
in a house like this with my husband...

260
00:17:56.442 --> 00:17:59.570
but I guess that's all just in the...

261
00:18:00.846 --> 00:18:01.904
past.

262
00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:04.074
Who wants to see upstairs?

263
00:18:05.150 --> 00:18:08.415
It's a nice neighborhood
close to schools and shopping.

264
00:18:08.487 --> 00:18:11.923
There are hardwood floors throughout.
Passed almost every inspection.

265
00:18:11.991 --> 00:18:15.552
Big backyard goes back 100 feet.

266
00:18:21.133 --> 00:18:23.101
And in here is the bathroom.

267
00:18:23.168 --> 00:18:24.795
Very big, very...

268
00:18:26.472 --> 00:18:28.633
nice.

269
00:18:28.707 --> 00:18:30.265
It is nice.

270
00:18:30.342 --> 00:18:32.572
It seems like
it'd be a great place to work...

271
00:18:32.645 --> 00:18:35.443
but I just can't shake
this feeling of... evil.

272
00:18:35.514 --> 00:18:37.482
Evil? That crazy talk.

273
00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:44.781
Do you know anything about
the people who used to live here?

274
00:18:44.857 --> 00:18:48.486
People? No, nothing about people.
I don't remember anything.

275
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.996
Mr. Koji, did something strange
happen in this house?

276
00:18:52.064 --> 00:18:53.656
Strange? Don't be silly.

277
00:18:53.732 --> 00:18:55.632
This house perfectly normal.

278
00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:59.467
I'm sure you're right, and yet...
it's as if someone's watching us.

279
00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:04.499
Mr. Koji?

280
00:19:04.576 --> 00:19:07.943
That was me...
just excited about hiring you.

281
00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:10.948
Very, very enthusiastic!

282
00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:16.716
We offer medical and dental
and two weeks' paid vacation!

283
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:20.316
I'm hoping...
you can start today!

284
00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:22.451
Maybe get in a whole week!

285
00:19:22.528 --> 00:19:24.223
You put in for this job...

286
00:19:24.296 --> 00:19:26.491
we got wonderful opportunities for you.

287
00:19:26.565 --> 00:19:30.023
Mr. Koji, is there something
you're not telling me about this?

288
00:19:35.507 --> 00:19:38.670
I was... dirty.

289
00:19:39.979 --> 00:19:43.813
So... the job?

290
00:19:43.882 --> 00:19:45.509
I'll take it.

291
00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:53.589
Get your glove!
I'm in the backyard!

292
00:19:53.659 --> 00:19:56.594
Robbie, come on.
Let's go!

293
00:19:56.662 --> 00:19:59.495
That's not how you're going
to get through to him.

294
00:19:59.565 --> 00:20:01.760
Look, Rach, this is guy stuff.

295
00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:05.031
You got to trust me.

296
00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:08.039
<i>All right, Robbie, you ready
for the Tom Ryan Express?</i>

297
00:20:18.450 --> 00:20:21.886
Yeah, maybe, one day,
I can grow up to be just like you.

298
00:20:21.954 --> 00:20:25.014
All right,
I know I let you kids down...

299
00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.786
but you have no idea
how hard it is to be a father.

300
00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:31.455
Well, when you start,
let me know.

301
00:20:40.873 --> 00:20:42.568
You okay?

302
00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:44.233
My eyes! My eyes!

303
00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:52.044
Oh, much... better.

304
00:20:53.152 --> 00:20:55.245
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

305
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.447
I've taken balls
to the face before.

306
00:20:57.523 --> 00:21:00.321
Hi. I'm Cindy Campbell,
your new neighbor.

307
00:21:00.392 --> 00:21:02.360
Tom, Tom Ryan.

308
00:21:02.428 --> 00:21:04.896
You, uh, live here
all by yourself?

309
00:21:04.963 --> 00:21:06.954
Well, I'm-I'm taking care
of Mrs. Norris...

310
00:21:07.032 --> 00:21:10.763
but... yes, for the first time
in my life, I'm on my own.

311
00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:12.269
I know that feeling.

312
00:21:13.338 --> 00:21:16.637
- It wasn't always that way.
- I know.

313
00:21:16.708 --> 00:21:18.835
You thought you'd found
your soul mate.

314
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:20.845
Yes.

315
00:21:20.913 --> 00:21:22.904
And then one day
you come home...

316
00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:26.280
and find your so-called soul mate
in bed with a complete stranger.

317
00:21:26.351 --> 00:21:29.616
Well, not a complete stranger-
Sammy Sosa.

318
00:21:30.823 --> 00:21:32.950
Sound familiar?

319
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:36.152
No, not at all.

320
00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.396
But I do know what it's like
to be in that much pain...

321
00:21:39.465 --> 00:21:42.298
and the worst part is
you have to suffer through it-

322
00:21:42.367 --> 00:21:44.767
- Alone?
- It looks like we have a lot in-

323
00:21:44.837 --> 00:21:47.305
Common.

324
00:21:47.372 --> 00:21:50.068
- We're already finishing each other's-
- Dinner.

325
00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:53.571
Sentences.

326
00:21:54.746 --> 00:21:58.773
Well... maybe all we really need
is a friend.

327
00:21:58.851 --> 00:22:01.411
I'd like that.

328
00:22:01.487 --> 00:22:03.751
Well, I better get back
to Mrs. Norris.

329
00:22:03.822 --> 00:22:06.290
It's time to put her catheter in,
and then after that...

330
00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:08.349
I've got to scrub
in between her fat folds...

331
00:22:08.427 --> 00:22:10.554
and I've got to lance her boils.

332
00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.392
I've got to open her up
and then-

333
00:22:43.128 --> 00:22:45.392
...empty the colostomy bag and...

334
00:22:45.464 --> 00:22:47.659
Mop up the drool.

335
00:22:47.733 --> 00:22:49.598
That's wonderful.

336
00:22:49.668 --> 00:22:52.330
- I'll see you around?
- Definitely.

337
00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:54.497
Okay.

338
00:22:56.074 --> 00:22:58.565
Okay, Mrs. Norris,
time to dig out that doody bubble.

339
00:24:03.642 --> 00:24:06.736
Whoa... Oh! Ow!

340
00:24:22.661 --> 00:24:24.686
Mrs. Norris?

341
00:24:24.763 --> 00:24:27.323
Have you noticed anything
strange about this house?

342
00:24:27.399 --> 00:24:30.334
- Yes! Yes!
- No?

343
00:24:30.402 --> 00:24:31.369
Yes!

344
00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:34.234
Oh, you're probably right.
Guess I'm just being silly.

345
00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:38.272
Just relax now.

346
00:24:38.343 --> 00:24:41.073
Here we go. Okay.

347
00:24:41.146 --> 00:24:44.377
Oh, you poor thing.
You don't have to be scared.

348
00:24:44.449 --> 00:24:47.543
I'm here to take care of you.

349
00:24:47.619 --> 00:24:50.986
You know, I think you and I
are going to be wonderful friends.

350
00:24:51.056 --> 00:24:54.856
I do. That's right. Just relax.

351
00:24:54.926 --> 00:24:57.326
Let's get in those ears.

352
00:24:57.396 --> 00:25:00.263
Okay. All right.

353
00:25:00.332 --> 00:25:03.961
That's right.
Oh, it feels good.

354
00:25:06.138 --> 00:25:08.606
Okay.

355
00:25:08.674 --> 00:25:11.165
You love this, don't you?

356
00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:14.542
It's nice and warm.
Feels good, doesn't it?

357
00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:17.775
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

358
00:25:17.849 --> 00:25:20.215
I'm so sorry!

359
00:26:39.297 --> 00:26:42.198
Robbie!

360
00:26:42.267 --> 00:26:44.201
Come on!

361
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:46.533
Let's toss the old pigskin!

362
00:26:53.779 --> 00:26:55.337
Ooh.

363
00:26:55.414 --> 00:26:58.315
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.
Are you all right?

364
00:26:58.383 --> 00:27:00.977
It's okay.
My throat cushioned the blow.

365
00:27:01.052 --> 00:27:04.647
Thank God.
I lost my temper. My son's-

366
00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:06.987
What's wrong?
You look scared.

367
00:27:07.058 --> 00:27:08.923
Oh, nothing. It's just-

368
00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:11.428
There's something
going on in this house.

369
00:27:11.496 --> 00:27:13.760
Last night, I saw a face.

370
00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:16.494
- Did it have a nose?
- Yes.

371
00:27:16.568 --> 00:27:18.331
That does sound like a face.

372
00:27:18.403 --> 00:27:21.861
And then there was
this weird hand in the shower...

373
00:27:21.940 --> 00:27:24.204
and this horrible thing
on the stairs.

374
00:27:24.276 --> 00:27:26.608
I can't go through
this all again.

375
00:27:26.678 --> 00:27:29.670
Oh, I get it.
There's some other guy.

376
00:27:29.748 --> 00:27:32.911
You still love him, don't you?
I wish you both the best.

377
00:27:32.984 --> 00:27:36.010
Wait! You don't understand.

378
00:27:36.087 --> 00:27:39.955
It's painful to talk about,
but you deserve to know.

379
00:27:41.827 --> 00:27:44.227
I was married once.

380
00:27:44.296 --> 00:27:48.528
- Get out the way, bitch!
- Don't call me no bitch! You ain't shit!

381
00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.465
Shut your ass up, snow ho!

382
00:27:52.938 --> 00:27:56.601
Well... actually, married twice.

383
00:27:58.376 --> 00:28:00.435
My husband and I
were living our dream.

384
00:28:00.512 --> 00:28:04.175
Ladies and gentlemen,
your challenger, Cindy Campbell.

385
00:28:06.184 --> 00:28:09.449
Stay loose, Cindy.
Remember your training. Keep your focus.

386
00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:14.592
Always think, where's
the next punch coming-

387
00:28:14.659 --> 00:28:17.287
After 20 fights, I was undefeated.

388
00:28:17.362 --> 00:28:19.489
Only one fighter stood
between me and the belt.

389
00:28:19.564 --> 00:28:21.555
You got this chick.
She's nothing.

390
00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:23.362
Tiffany Stone!

391
00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:30.473
Cindy, listen to me.

392
00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:33.238
I know you're scared, but I believe in you.
You can win this.

393
00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:36.610
And if I do win, George, then will you
tell me what my nickname means?

394
00:28:36.681 --> 00:28:38.615
Yes. I promise.

395
00:28:38.683 --> 00:28:41.413
Okay. Now just stick with the jab
and lead with your right.

396
00:28:41.486 --> 00:28:43.511
Watch your footwork.

397
00:28:43.588 --> 00:28:46.113
Let's go!

398
00:28:54.599 --> 00:28:58.296
Whoa, whoa! You do that one more time,
I'm taking a point off, you hear me?

399
00:29:00.872 --> 00:29:03.773
I got it, I got it!
Dude, check it out!

400
00:29:11.082 --> 00:29:13.778
I can't take it anymore!

401
00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:26.155
And that's when I lost my cool

402
00:29:26.231 --> 00:29:28.529
and made the biggest mistake
of my life.

403
00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.534
Cindy, no!

404
00:29:31.770 --> 00:29:33.237
Ooh, a nickel!

405
00:29:39.811 --> 00:29:42.803
No!

406
00:30:22.988 --> 00:30:25.388
Get out of the way!

407
00:30:25.457 --> 00:30:27.755
George!

408
00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:31.421
No!

409
00:30:31.496 --> 00:30:34.829
If I hadn't have thrown that punch,
none of it would've happened.

410
00:30:34.899 --> 00:30:37.697
- I blame myself for it all.
- As well you should.

411
00:30:37.769 --> 00:30:41.705
But, Cindy, the past is the past.

412
00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:44.435
Maybe you ought to think
about your future.

413
00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:46.500
If I'm ever going to love again...

414
00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:49.012
it has to be with somebody
who'll be there for me.

415
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.413
Well, I don't have a great track record
in that department. Just ask my son.

416
00:30:52.484 --> 00:30:55.180
I have.
What's an "cock monger"?

417
00:30:56.655 --> 00:30:58.748
Uh... that's not really important.

418
00:30:58.823 --> 00:31:01.348
What matters is
I've let a lot of people down.

419
00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:03.826
Oh.

420
00:31:03.895 --> 00:31:07.058
- I should go.
- Wait!

421
00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:11.659
Maybe I'm just not meant
to be happy...

422
00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:16.999
but something about you
makes me want to try.

423
00:31:35.527 --> 00:31:37.722
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

424
00:31:40.632 --> 00:31:43.123
Why is the sky so dark?

425
00:31:43.201 --> 00:31:45.294
Why is the wind moving
towards the storm?

426
00:31:47.105 --> 00:31:49.573
Why don't any of us have driers?

427
00:31:49.641 --> 00:31:53.099
I've never seen clouds
like that before!

428
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:03.854
- You okay?
- Yeah.

429
00:32:03.922 --> 00:32:05.856
- Can you believe that thunder?
- No.

430
00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:08.893
That storm is so fierce.
I've never seen anything like it.

431
00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.690
- I haven't either.
- Imagine being out there.

432
00:32:11.763 --> 00:32:15.130
That last one sounded really close.

433
00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:18.328
Don't worry- lightning never
strikes in the same place twice.

434
00:32:20.305 --> 00:32:23.103
- Where's Rachel?
- I thought she was with you.

435
00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:29.212
Oh, there you are.

436
00:32:37.722 --> 00:32:39.986
Okay. That's it. We're fine.

437
00:32:40.058 --> 00:32:42.583
That last bolt of lightning
smelled like a-

438
00:32:42.660 --> 00:32:44.821
Giant turd.

439
00:32:44.896 --> 00:32:48.889
Yes, the... lightning.

440
00:32:48.967 --> 00:32:51.458
I'll go look for Robbie.

441
00:32:55.306 --> 00:32:57.399
Turn it again,
see if it'll start.

442
00:32:57.475 --> 00:33:00.603
I don't know what's going on.
The car's not working, it's just not working.

443
00:33:00.678 --> 00:33:03.670
Start!

444
00:33:03.748 --> 00:33:06.080
Go!

445
00:33:07.719 --> 00:33:11.155
My bowels have stopped moving!
Why?

446
00:33:11.222 --> 00:33:14.316
- How's it going, Marvin?
- I just had this car working; now it's dead.

447
00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:16.986
- Try changing the solenoid.
- Good idea.

448
00:33:17.061 --> 00:33:19.325
Death to America!

449
00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:23.498
Aw, shit!

450
00:33:43.988 --> 00:33:45.478
Run!

451
00:34:35.106 --> 00:34:38.132
Beautiful outfit!

452
00:34:38.209 --> 00:34:40.200
Thanks.

453
00:34:41.346 --> 00:34:44.247
- Where's your ride, G?
- Move it, dawg!

454
00:35:00.365 --> 00:35:03.129
Hello?

455
00:35:04.335 --> 00:35:06.269
"Haro"?

456
00:35:07.538 --> 00:35:09.529
Hibachi. Benihana. Teriyaki.

457
00:35:09.607 --> 00:35:12.804
Nagasaki. Okinawa.
Hokkaido. Yokohama.

458
00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:16.813
Karate. Judo. Sumo. Samurai.

459
00:35:16.881 --> 00:35:20.817
Nissan. Honda. Mitsubishi. Subaru.

460
00:35:20.885 --> 00:35:24.719
Hara-kiri. Tsunami.
Kamikaze. Banzai.

461
00:35:24.789 --> 00:35:28.919
Yamaha. Nikon. Casio. Aiwa.

462
00:35:30.295 --> 00:35:34.163
Minolta. Hitachi. Seiko. Toshiba.

463
00:35:34.232 --> 00:35:36.723
Buddha! Shitake kimono!

464
00:35:36.801 --> 00:35:41.670
Tempura. Sushi. Sashimi!

465
00:35:41.739 --> 00:35:43.468
Fujitsu!

466
00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:52.614
I can't read that.

467
00:35:52.684 --> 00:35:55.244
That's better.

468
00:36:00.191 --> 00:36:02.091
Let's go, honey!
Let's go! Let's go!

469
00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:05.086
Robbie, Dad's home!

470
00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:11.365
What is it?
What's going on?

471
00:36:11.436 --> 00:36:13.666
Death.

472
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.376
- Dad, talk to me. What's happening?
- There's no time to explain.

473
00:36:28.453 --> 00:36:30.182
Alien attack!

474
00:36:30.254 --> 00:36:33.121
Well, actually,
that about sums it up.

475
00:36:33.191 --> 00:36:35.625
Fill this up with food.
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

476
00:36:37.462 --> 00:36:41.364
My ass!

477
00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:45.800
Penis.

478
00:36:46.637 --> 00:36:47.831
We gotta go.

479
00:36:53.077 --> 00:36:55.238
- Cindy!
- Tom!

480
00:36:55.313 --> 00:36:57.213
- Run for it!
- Where are you going?

481
00:36:57.281 --> 00:37:01.183
Someone's out there, somebody
who knows a way to stop all of this.

482
00:37:01.252 --> 00:37:03.345
- Oh, you wouldn't understand.
- I understand.

483
00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:06.913
- Come with me.
- Oh, I'd like to, but my kids.

484
00:37:06.991 --> 00:37:09.892
I... guess this is good-bye.

485
00:37:09.961 --> 00:37:13.453
When this is all over, promise me that
you'll find me, that you'll never forget me...

486
00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:16.432
that you won't give up
until I'm back in your arms.

487
00:37:16.501 --> 00:37:18.833
- Alive?
- Yes.

488
00:37:18.903 --> 00:37:20.666
I promise.

489
00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:25.869
Good-bye, Cindy.

490
00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.610
Hey, wait!

491
00:37:32.683 --> 00:37:36.414
A solenoid... for luck.

492
00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:49.589
Marvin!
You put a solenoid in?

493
00:37:49.667 --> 00:37:51.999
Yeah, I got one
from that crackhead over there.

494
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:53.731
- Get in.
- Why should we?

495
00:37:53.805 --> 00:37:57.639
Because you're my responsibility now,
and like it or not, I'm all you've got.

496
00:37:58.209 --> 00:38:00.677
Ow!

497
00:38:01.679 --> 00:38:03.943
- Hey. Hey!
- Thank God.

498
00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:06.142
Hey! What are you doing?

499
00:38:06.217 --> 00:38:09.152
- Get in the car, Marvin.
- Come on, Tom, stop joking around.

500
00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:11.745
Get in the car, Marvin,
or you're gonna die.

501
00:38:11.823 --> 00:38:14.223
Okay, fine.

502
00:38:17.128 --> 00:38:19.995
- No, wait for me to-
- Still locked.

503
00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:22.658
- Why are you reaching at the same time?
- What do you mean?

504
00:38:22.733 --> 00:38:24.530
- All right, on three.
- You counting now?

505
00:38:24.602 --> 00:38:26.627
One, two, three, open the door!

506
00:38:26.704 --> 00:38:29.036
- Okay, on three.
- One, two-

507
00:38:29.107 --> 00:38:30.802
Three.

508
00:38:30.875 --> 00:38:33.173
- Don't do that. You're trying to annoy me.
- It's still locked.

509
00:38:33.244 --> 00:38:35.235
I'm going on three. One, two-

510
00:38:35.313 --> 00:38:36.905
Don't count when I count.
I have a problem with that.

511
00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:38.778
- What's the matter with you?
- Turn your mouth sideways.

512
00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:41.045
- If you look at me I lose count.
- What are you crazy?

513
00:38:41.119 --> 00:38:43.451
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

514
00:38:43.521 --> 00:38:45.853
- Don't do it the same time.
- You said "three."

515
00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:47.447
- You go on "four." Can you count?
- Four.

516
00:38:47.525 --> 00:38:49.959
- So on your "three" or my "four"?
- There's only one "three."

517
00:38:50.027 --> 00:38:52.325
- I'm tryin' to get in the car.
- Then you do it on "four."

518
00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:55.092
You said, "three." So are you doin' it
on "three" or am I doin' it on "two"?

519
00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:56.997
- For Christ's sake!
- I heard "three."

520
00:38:57.068 --> 00:38:58.626
If the count is "three,"
you do it on "four."

521
00:38:58.703 --> 00:39:00.295
- Now it's "four."
- Why would you go on "four"?

522
00:39:00.371 --> 00:39:02.236
You gave me "four" first
and you stole my "four."

523
00:39:02.306 --> 00:39:03.967
- But I have to count to "three" first.
- You stole my "four."

524
00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:06.441
- Just let me say "three."
- I've got wait on you now, huh?

525
00:39:06.511 --> 00:39:08.069
- You want the black man to wait again?
- Do whatever you want.

526
00:39:08.146 --> 00:39:11.081
- That's what I've been doin'.
- Why would you do that?

527
00:39:11.149 --> 00:39:13.674
Why would you reach for it when
I say "three"? That's what this is about.

528
00:39:13.751 --> 00:39:15.218
Do I still go on "four"?

529
00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:17.481
When I say "three,"
don't worry about "four."

530
00:39:17.555 --> 00:39:18.988
You got all the time in the world!

531
00:39:19.056 --> 00:39:23.152
You can go home, watch television
and come back and then open the door!

532
00:39:23.227 --> 00:39:24.421
- Fine.
- One-

533
00:39:24.495 --> 00:39:27.055
No. No "one." I'm out.
No thank you.

534
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:30.692
I'll take the next one.
Does that work for you?

535
00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:32.998
- Jesus.
- Attitude.

536
00:39:35.106 --> 00:39:36.869
Seriously, I'd rather be dead.

537
00:39:38.943 --> 00:39:41.070
GIRL
"A girl had a pet duck.

538
00:39:41.145 --> 00:39:43.340
"She fed and took care
of her pet duck.

539
00:39:43.414 --> 00:39:48.078
"But one day, the duck got loose
and ran away from the girl.

540
00:39:48.152 --> 00:39:50.712
"The duck ran down the road
and kept running...

541
00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:52.449
until he found a pond."

542
00:39:52.523 --> 00:39:56.152
Mr. President,
we've just received word...

543
00:39:56.227 --> 00:39:58.525
the planet is under attack by aliens.

544
00:39:58.596 --> 00:40:00.188
Oh. Okay.

545
00:40:00.264 --> 00:40:02.027
"The duck went back"-

546
00:40:02.099 --> 00:40:05.000
Sir? They've already wiped out
some of our cities.

547
00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:07.469
If nothing is done,
they'll kill us all.

548
00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:09.733
I see. Well, I'll handle that
in a minute.

549
00:40:09.807 --> 00:40:13.402
But right now, I need to find out
what's happening with the duck.

550
00:40:13.477 --> 00:40:17.208
Sir, with each passing moment,
more people will die.

551
00:40:17.281 --> 00:40:19.715
The people are gonna die
regardless...

552
00:40:19.784 --> 00:40:22.378
but this duck still has
a fighting chance.

553
00:40:22.453 --> 00:40:27.117
I've read the story before, Mr. President.

554
00:40:27.191 --> 00:40:29.216
The duck dies.

555
00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:33.219
My God!
That's horrible.

556
00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:36.323
Mr. President, the aliens?
We're under attack.

557
00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.233
You mean, right now all of these
children's parents could be dead?

558
00:40:40.771 --> 00:40:43.296
Kids! Kids, please!

559
00:40:43.374 --> 00:40:45.740
It's not as bad as it seems.

560
00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:49.405
They didn't die alone. I'm sure they
died with all the other people you loved.

561
00:40:51.048 --> 00:40:53.346
Even Santa Claus?

562
00:40:53.417 --> 00:40:56.386
No, of course not.
There's no such thing as Santa Claus.

563
00:40:59.857 --> 00:41:02.325
Just like the Tooth Fairy,
completely made up.

564
00:41:03.227 --> 00:41:05.752
Easter Bunny-
Never existed.

565
00:41:06.931 --> 00:41:09.126
The female orgasm.

566
00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:12.169
Wait and see what happens
when you try to find it.

567
00:41:13.271 --> 00:41:16.172
What's wrong? Your parents
all getting divorces?

568
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:19.437
I can give them a little advice,
if you'd like.

569
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:22.343
Oh, I forgot.
They're all dead.

570
00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:25.678
All right now, let's go on to
another story, "Rumpelforeskin."

571
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:28.446
"Stiltzkin," sir.
We have to get you to the White House.

572
00:41:28.519 --> 00:41:30.180
I just don't get kids.

573
00:41:30.254 --> 00:41:33.314
- Remind me to sign that abortion bill.
- Yes, sir.

574
00:41:45.836 --> 00:41:47.599
You may leave
through the forward exit doors...

575
00:41:47.672 --> 00:41:49.936
or the gaping hole
in the side of the plane.

576
00:41:50.007 --> 00:41:51.998
We realize you have
a choice in airlines...

577
00:41:52.076 --> 00:41:55.239
and we appreciate
you flying with Southern Coast Air.

578
00:41:55.313 --> 00:41:56.610
- Thank you.
- Hello?

579
00:41:59.917 --> 00:42:02.852
Hey! That's mine! I found it!

580
00:42:04.221 --> 00:42:06.985
- Cindy?
- Brenda?

581
00:42:07.058 --> 00:42:10.550
Oh, my God.
It's been so long.

582
00:42:10.628 --> 00:42:13.028
Yeah, too long.

583
00:42:13.097 --> 00:42:14.997
I thought you were dead.

584
00:42:15.066 --> 00:42:17.057
Oh, I thought
you were dead, too.

585
00:42:17.134 --> 00:42:19.534
What are you doing here?
Were you on this plane?

586
00:42:19.603 --> 00:42:21.662
No, I'm trying to get a good story.

587
00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:24.469
I'm a reporter now.
I work for the local news.

588
00:42:24.542 --> 00:42:26.134
Wow, you're really doing
well for yourself.

589
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:29.737
I was on assignment.
Take a look at this.

590
00:42:29.814 --> 00:42:31.509
Here's Detroit.

591
00:42:33.284 --> 00:42:35.809
And here's Detroit after the attack.

592
00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:40.353
Oh, my God.

593
00:42:40.424 --> 00:42:43.086
The attack was devastating.

594
00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:45.856
It's over, Cindy.
Humanity has lost the war.

595
00:42:45.930 --> 00:42:47.921
No, no. There's still hope.

596
00:42:47.998 --> 00:42:50.796
I have reason to believe that there's
someone here that has the answers...

597
00:42:50.868 --> 00:42:54.133
maybe even a way for us to fight back.

598
00:42:54.205 --> 00:42:57.538
Come on.
It would make a great story.

599
00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:59.940
Maybe. But how are
we supposed to get there?

600
00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:01.944
None of these cars work.

601
00:43:02.012 --> 00:43:03.877
Wait. See if this works.

602
00:43:06.884 --> 00:43:10.183
Hey! I got the last working car
in New York!

603
00:43:10.254 --> 00:43:13.189
This is our road, bitches! Ha-ha!

604
00:43:17.928 --> 00:43:20.624
You're right, Cindy.
That worked pretty well.

605
00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.029
I-

606
00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.907
Look at all the injured.

607
00:43:33.978 --> 00:43:35.570
It's so sad.

608
00:43:36.847 --> 00:43:39.338
Big-ass rat, man!

609
00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:41.317
Oh! That sewer took forever to fix!

610
00:43:41.385 --> 00:43:44.081
Man, I'm gonna need
a hot bath after all of that-

611
00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:45.816
What the hell happened here?

612
00:43:50.394 --> 00:43:53.090
- Zombies!
- Damn!

613
00:43:54.632 --> 00:43:56.031
Let's go!

614
00:43:57.501 --> 00:43:59.162
Don't let 'em bite you!

615
00:43:59.236 --> 00:44:02.034
Good news!
They can still feel electricity.

616
00:44:02.106 --> 00:44:05.234
Grandma?
The zombies have got my grandma!

617
00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:08.039
Die, Grandma! Die! Die!

618
00:44:08.112 --> 00:44:11.775
- I loved you! I loved you!
- Mahalik?

619
00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:14.215
Look what they did
to my grandmama!

620
00:44:14.285 --> 00:44:17.686
Whoa!

621
00:44:19.123 --> 00:44:21.057
That woman raised me from birth.

622
00:44:28.833 --> 00:44:31.631
Hey, he's got a car. He's got a car.

623
00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:33.693
Give us the car and the keys!

624
00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:37.366
This isn't my car.
I would, but I can't. It's not my car.

625
00:44:37.441 --> 00:44:41.275
It's not my car. Don't worry, kids.
The doors are locked.

626
00:44:41.345 --> 00:44:43.040
There's no possible way they can-

627
00:44:43.113 --> 00:44:46.708
Pull the robot out of chocolate.
But that's just common sense. Oh, waiter!

628
00:44:48.018 --> 00:44:50.248
- Daddy!
- Kids!

629
00:44:54.859 --> 00:44:57.419
Whoa!

630
00:44:58.496 --> 00:45:00.760
Why?

631
00:45:00.831 --> 00:45:02.890
Well.

632
00:45:02.967 --> 00:45:05.936
Get back! Get back!

633
00:45:09.940 --> 00:45:12.534
Gimme the gun.
I'm taking the car.

634
00:45:12.610 --> 00:45:14.601
What do I do about him?

635
00:45:14.678 --> 00:45:17.010
I don't want the car.
I just need a gun.

636
00:45:17.081 --> 00:45:19.345
No way I'm giving up the gun.
I want the car.

637
00:45:19.416 --> 00:45:23.409
So, you need a gun,
and you want a car.

638
00:45:23.487 --> 00:45:26.684
- What do you want?
- Well, I've never owned a knife.

639
00:45:26.757 --> 00:45:29.419
Okay. Let's all switch on three.

640
00:45:29.493 --> 00:45:32.360
One, two, three.

641
00:45:34.365 --> 00:45:36.333
Is this right?

642
00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:39.528
I don't think so.

643
00:45:41.171 --> 00:45:44.299
Dad, they're taking the car.

644
00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:48.038
Yes, well, uh, let's keep going.

645
00:45:48.112 --> 00:45:51.047
What?
That's it? You're giving up?

646
00:45:51.115 --> 00:45:53.447
Yeah, that's right. I'm giving up.

647
00:45:53.517 --> 00:45:55.849
You want a hero?
Go find someone else.

648
00:45:55.920 --> 00:45:58.320
Why?

649
00:45:59.723 --> 00:46:02.351
Let's go.

650
00:46:02.426 --> 00:46:04.792
Now, let me get this straight:

651
00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:08.764
The girl hugged the duck,
and then it dies?

652
00:46:08.832 --> 00:46:11.392
Mr. President,
the nation is under attack.

653
00:46:11.468 --> 00:46:13.163
Get me Homer Landsquiddy.

654
00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:15.728
You mean, "Homeland Security."

655
00:46:17.308 --> 00:46:20.004
Sir, this woman was an eyewitness
to one of the attacks.

656
00:46:20.077 --> 00:46:22.671
- What can you tell us?
- They're indestructible.

657
00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:25.408
The clothing was burned off
everyone's bodies.

658
00:46:25.482 --> 00:46:28.110
There were naked people
everywhere.

659
00:46:28.185 --> 00:46:30.653
- Were you naked?
- No.

660
00:46:30.721 --> 00:46:32.518
Thank God.
Some good news at last.

661
00:46:32.590 --> 00:46:34.421
Get her a souvenir.

662
00:46:54.445 --> 00:46:58.006
Lil' Kim-
Lil' Kim got my sandwich.

663
00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:02.247
Look out-
Russell Crowe's got a phone!

664
00:47:02.319 --> 00:47:04.879
R. Kelly, don't pee on me!

665
00:47:05.990 --> 00:47:08.049
My lovely lady lumps!

666
00:47:08.125 --> 00:47:10.116
Where are we?

667
00:47:10.194 --> 00:47:13.391
I'm not sure,
but I think we're close.

668
00:47:13.464 --> 00:47:16.922
It's supposed to be near mile 62.

669
00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:18.730
Is something wrong?

670
00:47:18.802 --> 00:47:21.100
No, it's just...

671
00:47:21.171 --> 00:47:24.607
I met this guy,
and I wonder if he's safe.

672
00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:26.609
Oh, you'd love him, Brenda.

673
00:47:26.677 --> 00:47:29.737
What's his name?
I might've already loved him.

674
00:47:29.813 --> 00:47:31.576
Tom Ryan.

675
00:47:31.649 --> 00:47:34.777
Yeah, did him.
Big, fat Chinese guy?

676
00:47:34.852 --> 00:47:37.946
No... No.

677
00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:41.389
But he is the kind of guy that I'd like
to share the rest of my life with.

678
00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:48.555
Cindy! Look!

679
00:47:56.573 --> 00:47:58.268
What is this place?

680
00:47:58.342 --> 00:48:01.072
I don't know, but the boy's father's
somewhere in there.

681
00:48:01.145 --> 00:48:03.079
We'll have to sneak our way in.

682
00:48:03.147 --> 00:48:05.138
But we're not gonna
blend in dressed like this.

683
00:48:05.215 --> 00:48:08.150
- Brenda, look.
- He's a wonderful boy.

684
00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.710
Ezekiel?

685
00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:40.716
Ezekiel, where are you?

686
00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:50.556
Ezekiel,
shall we have a foot race?

687
00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:52.561
No cheating.

688
00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:17.010
That's him!

689
00:49:17.087 --> 00:49:19.385
He's cute.

690
00:49:22.392 --> 00:49:27.227
Friends, friends. Do not fear the noise
of those of whom we do not speak.

691
00:49:27.297 --> 00:49:29.492
There is a gentle truce
between our village

692
00:49:29.566 --> 00:49:32.091
and the creatures
beyond their borders.

693
00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:34.034
Now, who would like to say grace?

694
00:49:34.104 --> 00:49:36.004
Ooh!

695
00:49:36.073 --> 00:49:37.904
Ah, Ezekiel.

696
00:49:39.209 --> 00:49:41.200
Pee-pee.

697
00:49:41.278 --> 00:49:44.213
Pee-pee vagina.

698
00:49:46.450 --> 00:49:48.543
Amen.

699
00:49:56.693 --> 00:49:58.923
Father?

700
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:01.658
Holly.

701
00:50:01.732 --> 00:50:04.064
For what purpose
do you interrupt

702
00:50:04.134 --> 00:50:08.537
the celebration
of the domestic partnership

703
00:50:08.605 --> 00:50:10.903
of Mordecai and Hoss?

704
00:50:10.974 --> 00:50:12.908
The guards caught
two outsiders near the cabin.

705
00:50:19.616 --> 00:50:21.049
Who are you?

706
00:50:21.118 --> 00:50:24.178
I must speak with you.
I was sent by your son.

707
00:50:24.254 --> 00:50:26.313
Don't be ridiculous.

708
00:50:26.390 --> 00:50:28.654
- I have no son.
- That's not true!

709
00:50:28.725 --> 00:50:31.023
I know who you are.
I've seen the pictures.

710
00:50:31.094 --> 00:50:34.222
- I was young. I needed the work.
- No.

711
00:50:34.298 --> 00:50:35.890
At Mrs. Norris's house.

712
00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:38.366
I didn't know whose house it was.

713
00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:40.869
They drugged me.
Never mind that.

714
00:50:40.938 --> 00:50:45.068
You're outsiders.
The council will decide your fates.

715
00:50:51.181 --> 00:50:54.708
The question of the outsiders
is now at hand.

716
00:50:54.785 --> 00:50:58.380
But first, Martha,
have you some tidings?

717
00:50:58.455 --> 00:51:00.821
Nathaniel Winston
and Alice Smith

718
00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.859
have informed me
of their intentions.

719
00:51:02.926 --> 00:51:06.123
He intends to have sex with her
as soon as possible.

720
00:51:06.196 --> 00:51:10.257
She intends to put up a mild fight
and then give in.

721
00:51:16.773 --> 00:51:19.799
Amos, something does trouble you?

722
00:51:20.844 --> 00:51:25.247
We now have a majority
of those who wish to say "I'm"...

723
00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:27.647
instead of “I am."

724
00:51:27.718 --> 00:51:30.050
- I'm for that.
- I am against it.

725
00:51:31.188 --> 00:51:33.486
Silence!

726
00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:35.422
We have more important matters
to discuss.

727
00:51:35.492 --> 00:51:38.950
I fear that the presence
of the outsiders

728
00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:42.487
will attract those of whom
we do not speak.

729
00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:45.763
If you talk about those
of whom we do not speak...

730
00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:48.134
have you not spoken of that

731
00:51:48.205 --> 00:51:50.002
about which we do not talk?

732
00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:53.008
Do not speak of that
of about which

733
00:51:53.076 --> 00:51:57.877
we talk of not speaking...
about.

734
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:10.853
Elder Hale. We should welcome
the outsiders among us.

735
00:52:10.928 --> 00:52:14.386
Jeremiah, ought not
your tongue be held?

736
00:52:14.464 --> 00:52:17.194
I am sorry, Elder Hale...

737
00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:21.465
but sometimes my tongue wiggles
beyond my ability to control it.

738
00:52:23.373 --> 00:52:27.173
This is a problem with which
I have had much experience.

739
00:52:27.244 --> 00:52:30.338
Maybe I could help him in a room
in which there are no others.

740
00:52:31.715 --> 00:52:33.945
Or you can all watch.
I don't give a shit.

741
00:52:34.017 --> 00:52:36.850
Silence.

742
00:52:40.557 --> 00:52:45.017
After this, how about you take
your thing of which we do not speak...

743
00:52:45.095 --> 00:52:47.290
and slide it up in my place
of which I like-

744
00:52:47.364 --> 00:52:49.298
Silence!

745
00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:51.698
The elders will consult.

746
00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:01.904
Ah. Much better.

747
00:53:35.112 --> 00:53:39.048
I'm not in my house, am I?

748
00:53:39.116 --> 00:53:41.016
No.

749
00:53:44.187 --> 00:53:48.920
Outsiders, we have decided
to let you stay with us...

750
00:53:48.992 --> 00:53:52.291
so that you'll be safe from
those from of whom we do not-

751
00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:54.489
Or don't.

752
00:53:54.564 --> 00:53:56.054
Speak.

753
00:53:56.133 --> 00:53:59.159
But now that you are
a part of our village...

754
00:53:59.236 --> 00:54:01.295
understand this:

755
00:54:01.371 --> 00:54:03.498
You may never leave.

756
00:54:03.573 --> 00:54:06.804
No! No!

757
00:54:06.877 --> 00:54:09.402
How did your son die?

758
00:54:09.479 --> 00:54:12.004
- The fate of the world is at stake.
- You know what to do.

759
00:54:12.082 --> 00:54:13.743
Was it you? Did you kill him?

760
00:54:13.817 --> 00:54:15.751
This is some shit
up with which we will not put.

761
00:54:15.819 --> 00:54:18.310
- I'm for that.
- I am against it.

762
00:54:21.658 --> 00:54:24.923
This village isn't
what it used to be.

763
00:54:27.330 --> 00:54:30.697
Just hours after
the devastating alien attack...

764
00:54:30.767 --> 00:54:34.066
world leaders have gathered
at the United Nations.

765
00:54:34.137 --> 00:54:36.833
In this, mankind's darkest hour...

766
00:54:36.907 --> 00:54:39.239
the human race has turned, as one...

767
00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:41.243
to the wisdom and leadership

768
00:54:41.311 --> 00:54:43.836
of the President
of the United States.

769
00:54:43.914 --> 00:54:47.850
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

770
00:54:47.918 --> 00:54:49.886
Go get 'em, tiger.

771
00:54:49.953 --> 00:54:51.944
They mean you, sir.

772
00:54:52.022 --> 00:54:53.819
Oh, yes, of course.

773
00:55:02.833 --> 00:55:07.031
So... an Indian, a Frenchman
and the Pope are all on a plane.

774
00:55:07.104 --> 00:55:11.006
The pilot says,
"Hey, are any of you not circumcised?"

775
00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:14.009
So the Pope lifts up
his robe and says...

776
00:55:14.077 --> 00:55:16.773
"Shut up, stupid.
You don't even speak English."

777
00:55:18.381 --> 00:55:20.713
The Israeli asked the Japanese guy
to open his eyes...

778
00:55:20.784 --> 00:55:23.218
but the Japanese man says,
"I'm not squinting, you crazy Jew.

779
00:55:23.286 --> 00:55:26.653
You're the one who sold me
these cheap glasses."

780
00:55:26.723 --> 00:55:29.385
What's the difference between
a Belgian and a lump of dog shit?

781
00:55:29.459 --> 00:55:33.020
The Belgian drinks wine,
but the dog shit smells good.

782
00:55:37.434 --> 00:55:41.336
But, on a serious note,
I'm here today at the, uh...

783
00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:44.903
"un"...because the Earth
has been attacked.

784
00:55:44.975 --> 00:55:47.842
I'm happy to report that we may
have found a way to fight back.

785
00:55:47.911 --> 00:55:50.402
My military advisers
at the Pentagram

786
00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.243
have managed
to do the impossible.

787
00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:55.978
They have captured one
of the alien heat ray guns.

788
00:55:56.052 --> 00:56:00.318
As you know, the heat ray destroys the body,
leaving behind nothing but clothes.

789
00:56:00.390 --> 00:56:03.553
Our engineers have managed to reverse
the polarity of the weapon

790
00:56:03.627 --> 00:56:06.926
in the hopes that it can now
be turned against

791
00:56:06.997 --> 00:56:09.056
the alien invaders.

792
00:56:13.336 --> 00:56:16.362
Well, where was I?

793
00:56:16.439 --> 00:56:19.602
Ah, yes. We expect that the
alien shields will be vulnerable

794
00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:22.167
to this reconfigured weapon.

795
00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:27.514
People, please! Please!

796
00:56:27.584 --> 00:56:32.920
Please, people. Now, I know that this
new technology may seem frightening...

797
00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:36.425
but I believe that deep down
inside this heat cannon

798
00:56:36.493 --> 00:56:37.926
is our best chance.

799
00:56:37.994 --> 00:56:40.428
Let me give you a demonstration.

800
00:56:40.497 --> 00:56:43.193
Now let's see if this thing
is plugged in.

801
00:56:45.769 --> 00:56:47.930
Uh... it's not a very pretty sight.

802
00:56:48.004 --> 00:56:50.268
Everything's loose
and flapping around.

803
00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:52.308
Look at this little pink thing.

804
00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:02.409
Someone get some lubricant,
and we'll slather it around in here.

805
00:57:02.485 --> 00:57:04.817
There.

806
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:20.663
Harper. Good God,
these people are all naked.

807
00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:24.104
Have you no shame?
Have you no decency?

808
00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:26.438
- Sir, you're naked, too.
- I am?

809
00:57:26.509 --> 00:57:29.171
- I thought this was a wrinkly leather coat.
- Sir!

810
00:57:29.246 --> 00:57:30.838
- These aren't buttons?
- No!

811
00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:33.246
I've been pulling this thing
up and down like a zipper.

812
00:57:33.316 --> 00:57:34.977
Mr. President, please.

813
00:57:35.051 --> 00:57:37.485
There goes that duck again.

814
00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:45.494
Yo, man, you see this red weed?

815
00:57:45.562 --> 00:57:47.553
Nope.

816
00:57:47.631 --> 00:57:49.565
Dad, how much further till Mom's?

817
00:57:49.633 --> 00:57:51.464
I don't know.

818
00:57:51.534 --> 00:57:54.128
I'm not sure how much longer
I can carry your sister.

819
00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:57.503
I've been walking
this entire time.

820
00:57:57.574 --> 00:58:00.168
- Then who the hell is-
- I'll pay you.

821
00:58:00.243 --> 00:58:02.837
Stay close, Rachel.

822
00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:06.348
Dad, look!

823
00:58:06.416 --> 00:58:09.214
Hey! Hey! You guys!
I want to help!

824
00:58:09.286 --> 00:58:11.220
Robbie! Oh, no.

825
00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:16.223
Don't move. For God's sake,
stay right there. I'll be right back!

826
00:58:16.293 --> 00:58:19.285
Hey! Hey, you guys!
I want to help.

827
00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.461
Awesome!

828
00:58:23.533 --> 00:58:26.127
- Wait!
- Are you crazy?

829
00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:28.329
No!
They'll pay for half my college.

830
00:58:29.739 --> 00:58:31.604
Kick ass.

831
00:58:31.675 --> 00:58:33.506
Robbie!

832
00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:35.510
- Yes!
- What's the matter with you?

833
00:58:35.578 --> 00:58:38.843
Hey, look at that guy.
This is so cool!

834
00:58:40.917 --> 00:58:44.648
Robbie! Robbie!

835
00:58:50.126 --> 00:58:52.651
Rachel! Rachel!

836
00:58:52.729 --> 00:58:55.027
Little girl, are you alone?

837
00:58:55.098 --> 00:58:57.157
You need to come with me.

838
00:58:57.233 --> 00:58:59.224
I'll keep you safe, right, kids?

839
00:58:59.302 --> 00:59:00.735
Uh-uh.

840
00:59:00.804 --> 00:59:02.863
- Do you have a little brother?
- Get away from her!

841
00:59:06.343 --> 00:59:08.004
Run away, kids!

842
00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.540
Toward the tripod,
if you have to!

843
00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.945
Don't go! I've got a Ferris wheel
and a chimp...

844
00:59:13.016 --> 00:59:15.450
and a big, soft bed
we can all get in.

845
00:59:19.989 --> 00:59:22.389
No, please!

846
00:59:22.459 --> 00:59:23.756
Not my real face!

847
00:59:23.827 --> 00:59:25.692
Not my real face!

848
00:59:25.762 --> 00:59:27.787
No!

849
00:59:33.436 --> 00:59:35.028
Over here.

850
00:59:35.105 --> 00:59:38.199
Follow me to safety.

851
00:59:38.274 --> 00:59:41.402
- Ow!
- Follow me to safety.

852
00:59:41.478 --> 00:59:44.413
- I don't know about this.
- I'm an excellent judge of character.

853
00:59:44.481 --> 00:59:46.972
All right. Yeah.

854
01:00:12.142 --> 01:00:15.077
That's it.

855
01:00:15.145 --> 01:00:16.373
Oh, Brenda.

856
01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:20.815
Yes! You did it!

857
01:00:20.884 --> 01:00:24.581
You have learned quickly
and produced splendid butter.

858
01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:27.122
Are you sure you have not
churned before?

859
01:00:27.190 --> 01:00:29.681
Well, we don't call it churning
where I come from.

860
01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:39.197
Pee-pee vagina.

861
01:00:53.383 --> 01:00:55.317
Quick! Into the cellar.

862
01:00:55.385 --> 01:00:57.910
No!

863
01:00:57.987 --> 01:01:01.013
This is the cellar.
That's the cesspool.

864
01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.682
Damn it!

865
01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:06.559
Quick!

866
01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:29.918
Boogedy-boogedy-boogedy.

867
01:01:29.986 --> 01:01:32.147
Boogedy-boogedy-boogedy-boogedy.

868
01:01:32.222 --> 01:01:35.055
Hey! You're not monsters.

869
01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:38.885
Old Lady Henderson?

870
01:01:38.962 --> 01:01:41.362
And Pig-Face Joe!

871
01:01:46.569 --> 01:01:48.434
What happened?

872
01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:49.995
It is Henry.

873
01:01:50.073 --> 01:01:52.633
He has suffered a heart attack

874
01:01:52.709 --> 01:01:54.700
brought on by this knife.

875
01:01:56.145 --> 01:01:58.045
Who did this?

876
01:01:58.114 --> 01:02:00.048
It was... Ezekiel.

877
01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.876
Henry, you need a hospital.

878
01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:06.444
It's not too late.
We can help you.

879
01:02:06.523 --> 01:02:09.651
Perhaps you could start by
not leaning on the knife.

880
01:02:12.762 --> 01:02:14.423
Do not be concerned for him,
Cindy.

881
01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:17.955
We have sent our most qualified
villager for medicines.

882
01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:33.038
I am so dead.

883
01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:35.710
Please, leave me alone
with Cindy and Brenda.

884
01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.377
I have much to tell them.

885
01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.816
Listen carefully to me.

886
01:02:42.892 --> 01:02:44.883
I am not long for this world.

887
01:02:44.961 --> 01:02:46.929
- Pussy.
- Brenda!

888
01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:50.796
What? 50 Cent got shot nine times.
He's still walking around.

889
01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:53.927
Tell me, Henry, who killed the boy?
Was it you?

890
01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:57.837
No, I loved him and his mother
very much.

891
01:02:57.907 --> 01:02:59.898
I should have been with him
when he died.

892
01:02:59.976 --> 01:03:02.240
It was horrible.

893
01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:04.337
What happened?
You must tell me.

894
01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:06.575
They went to a boxing match.

895
01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:09.083
It was a women's
championship title fight.

896
01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:13.386
And there was
a terrible accident.

897
01:03:13.456 --> 01:03:15.617
Oh, my God.

898
01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:28.436
Only in America!

899
01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:35.838
All this time, I've been
searching for his killer

900
01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:37.880
when it was me, Brenda.

901
01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.881
It was all my fault.

902
01:03:39.949 --> 01:03:42.679
Henry, your son told me
that if I found his killer...

903
01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:44.720
I would know how
to defeat the aliens.

904
01:03:44.787 --> 01:03:47.722
And he was right.
Don't you see?

905
01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:50.918
All you have to do is-

906
01:03:54.230 --> 01:03:56.323
Who the hell
let his ass out of jail?

907
01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:58.162
His brother, the sheriff.

908
01:04:01.537 --> 01:04:04.506
Fuckin' "A."

909
01:04:09.412 --> 01:04:11.642
There you go, sweetie.

910
01:04:11.714 --> 01:04:13.648
We're gonna die, aren't we?

911
01:04:13.716 --> 01:04:17.846
Hey, nothing's gonna happen to you.
I haven't lost anyone yet.

912
01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.378
- You've lost Robbie.
- Except Robbie.

913
01:04:21.457 --> 01:04:25.860
None of that matters right now.
What's important is that I'm here with you.

914
01:04:25.928 --> 01:04:27.862
Try and get some sleep, okay?

915
01:04:29.132 --> 01:04:31.191
Sing me
"Lullaby and Good Night"?

916
01:04:32.969 --> 01:04:35.335
I don't know that one.

917
01:04:35.405 --> 01:04:37.930
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?

918
01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:40.066
I'm sorry, Rachel,
I don't that one, either.

919
01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:19.247
Hey. Come on in.

920
01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:21.909
Have a seat.

921
01:05:21.984 --> 01:05:24.976
- The name's Oliver.
- Tom Ryan.

922
01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.687
I found this place.
Plenty of food-

923
01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:33.527
Along with two freshly killed
busybodies upstairs...

924
01:05:33.596 --> 01:05:36.793
who "owned" the place.
We could stay here forever.

925
01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:39.630
- Are you afraid?
- Of course I'm afraid.

926
01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:41.863
I'm not.
I've been around death plenty.

927
01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.429
I used to drive an ambulance
in the city...

928
01:05:44.507 --> 01:05:48.102
but, apparently, I wasn't
a very strong driver.

929
01:05:48.177 --> 01:05:50.509
It seems I was killing more people
than I was saving.

930
01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:53.276
Something about that siren
got me excited.

931
01:05:53.349 --> 01:05:56.910
Wham! Carnage.

932
01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:59.420
But this is different.
This is a war.

933
01:05:59.489 --> 01:06:01.787
No, it's an extermination.

934
01:06:01.858 --> 01:06:04.622
It's no more of a war than there's a war
between men and maggots...

935
01:06:04.694 --> 01:06:07.026
or dragons and wolves...

936
01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:11.226
or men riding dragons,
throwing wolves at maggots.

937
01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.997
Damn it, Tom. Can't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

938
01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:17.562
These aliens must have a weakness.

939
01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:20.040
I heard that the Japs killed
a few of 'em over in Kikkoman.

940
01:06:20.109 --> 01:06:22.942
Kikkoman.
That's-That's soy sauce.

941
01:06:23.012 --> 01:06:24.775
Right, yeah. Low sodium.

942
01:06:24.847 --> 01:06:28.010
What I'm trying to say, Tom, is that you
and I should be fighting these things.

943
01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.484
It's us that should be coming up
from under the ground.

944
01:06:30.553 --> 01:06:32.612
Of course, we'll have to
bury ourselves first...

945
01:06:32.688 --> 01:06:34.019
but it'll be worth it.

946
01:06:34.090 --> 01:06:36.217
Cool breeze. No sunblock. Worms.

947
01:06:36.292 --> 01:06:39.284
When we build our own tripods,
they'll have four legs.

948
01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.330
I gotta show ya something.

949
01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.692
We'll tunnel up from behind
and scare the piss out of ‘em.

950
01:06:52.708 --> 01:06:55.199
Wish we had some shovels,
don't you?

951
01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:06.617
Dad.

952
01:08:12.722 --> 01:08:15.190
Daddy!

953
01:08:15.258 --> 01:08:16.885
Rachel!

954
01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:23.262
Rachel! Rachel!

955
01:08:32.608 --> 01:08:35.543
What's the secret, Brenda?
What am I missing?

956
01:08:37.747 --> 01:08:40.716
Oh, please!
More fake monsters?

957
01:08:48.624 --> 01:08:52.253
Cindy!

958
01:09:08.044 --> 01:09:11.241
Help! Help!

959
01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:15.607
I promised I'd find you, didn't I?

960
01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:32.196
Where are we?
What is this?

961
01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:35.328
Some kind of basket
attached to the tripod.

962
01:09:35.404 --> 01:09:37.065
Jesus!

963
01:09:37.139 --> 01:09:40.040
I know, it's horrible.
But why?

964
01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:41.940
What are the aliens
gonna do to us?

965
01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.945
I don't know,
but they're taking everyone-

966
01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.709
young, old, rich, poor, Chingy.

967
01:09:57.893 --> 01:09:59.986
- Daddy!
- Rachel!

968
01:10:00.062 --> 01:10:03.463
- No!
- Daddy! Help!

969
01:10:03.532 --> 01:10:05.432
Tom!

970
01:10:15.277 --> 01:10:17.939
Am I dead?

971
01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:20.107
You're not dead.

972
01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:32.259
- Brenda!
- Cindy!

973
01:10:32.328 --> 01:10:35.126
Hey... could be worse.

974
01:10:37.933 --> 01:10:41.198
- You want to switch?
- Okay.

975
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:44.171
Brenda, look!

976
01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:47.835
I don't believe it!
The aliens killed a dinosaur!

977
01:10:52.014 --> 01:10:56.110
Hello, humans.
Welcome to the inside of the command tripod.

978
01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.387
Where's Rachel? What have
you done with my daughter?

979
01:10:59.455 --> 01:11:03.323
All in good time, Tom.
But first, I want to play a game.

980
01:11:03.392 --> 01:11:07.192
The devices you wear
will trigger in 60 seconds.

981
01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:11.723
The switch on the wall
behind Cindy will disable them.

982
01:11:11.801 --> 01:11:13.666
But where is the key?

983
01:11:13.736 --> 01:11:15.328
I'll give you a hint, Cindy.

984
01:11:16.772 --> 01:11:18.501
Let the game begin.

985
01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:22.305
I... I don't get it.

986
01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:27.008
Okay...
maybe this will help you "see."

987
01:11:33.956 --> 01:11:37.551
You want me to... cut something?

988
01:11:37.626 --> 01:11:40.891
That should be obvious, yes.

989
01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:44.399
No.

990
01:11:46.535 --> 01:11:49.561
No!
The key is behind your eye, okay?

991
01:11:55.578 --> 01:11:58.911
Zoltar, get in here!
This one's gonna do it!

992
01:12:02.952 --> 01:12:05.216
Fake eye.

993
01:12:05.287 --> 01:12:07.619
Bad bar fight in '96.

994
01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:13.861
Oh.

995
01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:19.967
Oh... oh, I hope this doesn't
come between us.

996
01:12:20.035 --> 01:12:22.026
Of course not.

997
01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:31.439
Is it too late
for me to try this on?

998
01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.379
Silence!
The game is not yet over.

999
01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.546
- Rachel!
- Daddy!

1000
01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:40.054
- Robbie!
Daddy!

1001
01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:48.225
The only thing keeping
your children alive, Tom, is you.

1002
01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:50.788
Well, we had a good run.

1003
01:12:54.470 --> 01:12:57.132
Ha! You weren't expecting that,
were you?

1004
01:12:57.206 --> 01:13:00.141
On the contrary,
I was counting on it.

1005
01:13:05.915 --> 01:13:08.611
I call it..."the nutcracker."

1006
01:13:08.684 --> 01:13:10.618
Why?

1007
01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:13.416
Of course.

1008
01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:24.259
Tempura. Sushi. Sashimi!

1009
01:13:28.204 --> 01:13:30.468
Oh, my- Oh, my gosh.

1010
01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:34.134
Of course. Follow the blood.
Henry was his stepdad.

1011
01:13:34.210 --> 01:13:36.701
You're the little boy's real father!

1012
01:13:36.779 --> 01:13:38.679
Where did you even meet her?

1013
01:13:38.747 --> 01:13:41.215
It was spring break in Cabo. So what?

1014
01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.615
I blended in.
Seriously, who gives a crap?

1015
01:13:43.686 --> 01:13:45.017
What's this?

1016
01:13:47.523 --> 01:13:49.457
Enjoy your purple nurple, Tom.

1017
01:13:52.728 --> 01:13:54.821
Please, your son
wouldn't want this.

1018
01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:57.695
His soul walks the Earth because
of the pain you've caused him.

1019
01:13:57.766 --> 01:14:00.394
No. I have crossed a galaxy
for revenge.

1020
01:14:00.469 --> 01:14:02.664
But it's my fault.
Let the others go.

1021
01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:05.901
Oh, I don't think so.
Look upon him as he writhes!

1022
01:14:05.975 --> 01:14:09.376
Hey, Cindy!
Look, I'm on TV, y'all! Check it out!

1023
01:14:09.445 --> 01:14:11.538
I'm gonna give a shout out
to all my peeps!

1024
01:14:13.983 --> 01:14:15.678
Have you lost your mind?

1025
01:14:15.751 --> 01:14:18.185
No one... bitch slaps... Brenda!

1026
01:14:18.254 --> 01:14:20.415
Zoltar, help!

1027
01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:23.925
Oh, oh!
This is some bullshit!

1028
01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:27.360
I know you hold a grudge against humanity
for your son's death, but-

1029
01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.761
Oh, wet willy!

1030
01:14:29.832 --> 01:14:33.063
Killing us won't bring
your little boy back.

1031
01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:36.036
No. You will all pay
for what you have done.

1032
01:14:36.105 --> 01:14:38.198
Besides,
I've already built this thing.

1033
01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:42.702
When the trap closes on you,
it will lock the chain in place.

1034
01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:44.769
Your children will be saved...

1035
01:14:44.847 --> 01:14:47.441
but you will suffer a terrible death.

1036
01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:50.178
Can you hang on
to the ones you love?

1037
01:14:50.252 --> 01:14:52.379
You have 60 seconds.

1038
01:14:53.956 --> 01:14:57.619
- No.
- Don't worry, kids. I won't quit on you.

1039
01:14:59.161 --> 01:15:01.095
It's okay to let go, Dad.

1040
01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.723
All you ever had to do
was show that you loved me.

1041
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.264
And show me what it means
to be a man.

1042
01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.861
And show me
that I could love again.

1043
01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:12.769
We forgive you, Dad.

1044
01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.954
The spikes- they stopped!

1045
01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.991
- Kids!
- Daddy!

1046
01:15:36.332 --> 01:15:39.301
Are you... sparing our lives?

1047
01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.302
Anyone can hold a grudge...

1048
01:15:41.370 --> 01:15:43.668
but it takes real courage to forgive.

1049
01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:47.675
- The invasion is over.
- And?

1050
01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:50.803
And I guess I'm sorry or something.
I don't know.

1051
01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.506
Like you mean it.

1052
01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:54.515
Okay.

1053
01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:57.177
I'm sorry for killing millions of people.
Whatever!

1054
01:15:57.252 --> 01:15:59.914
Wait... where's Brenda?

1055
01:16:02.524 --> 01:16:04.151
What?

1056
01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:06.626
We're at peace now.
I was just sealing the deal.

1057
01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:11.229
Come on, Brenda. Let's go.

1058
01:16:11.300 --> 01:16:15.202
Bye, Zoltar!
Don't lose my number!

1059
01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:19.297
Tell me you didn't catch something.

1060
01:16:19.375 --> 01:16:22.276
Nah, it's cool.
She said she was a virgin.

1061
01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:26.846
We are so fucked.

1062
01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:43.998
Mommy!

1063
01:16:48.871 --> 01:16:50.168
Thank you.

1064
01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:54.303
Hey, look, kids- Grandpa.

1065
01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.007
No, that's my new husband.

1066
01:17:04.787 --> 01:17:09.417
Oh, I think it's romantic-
the way love can find anyone.

1067
01:17:13.328 --> 01:17:16.786
And so, love triumphed in the end...

1068
01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:19.163
and the invaders were destroyed.

1069
01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:21.964
For this world, our world...

1070
01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:24.005
is the world of man.

1071
01:17:24.072 --> 01:17:27.098
We have earned the right
to live here...

1072
01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:31.545
and as long as we love,
humanity will prevail.

1073
01:17:31.613 --> 01:17:35.447
Each of our enemies has failed
in their quest to defeat us...

1074
01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:40.250
each has been undone
by their own nefarious plans.

1075
01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:43.780
Among all worlds,
across all galaxies...

1076
01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:47.522
we stand above, we stand alone.

1077
01:17:47.596 --> 01:17:52.226
None can threaten our existence,
none can challenge our spirit.

1078
01:17:52.301 --> 01:17:54.235
And why?

1079
01:17:54.303 --> 01:17:57.602
Of all the qualities
that make us unique...

1080
01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.335
it is love that is
our greatest strength...

1081
01:18:00.409 --> 01:18:03.037
and because of love, mankind-

1082
01:18:07.082 --> 01:18:10.313
Thank you.
Hello, and welcome to the show.

1083
01:18:10.385 --> 01:18:14.151
We have got a very special man
with some very special news.

1084
01:18:14.223 --> 01:18:17.454
That's right- he's in the building!
The man who saved the world!

1085
01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:19.790
Put your hands together
for Tom Ryan!

1086
01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:25.459
- Yes!
- My best friend.

1087
01:18:34.409 --> 01:18:36.673
Whoo!

1088
01:18:41.316 --> 01:18:44.114
- Wow.
- That's it?

1089
01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:45.881
Okay.

1090
01:18:50.092 --> 01:18:53.459
- So, you're in love.
- I am. I'm in love.

1091
01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:01.000
He's lost it.
The boy's lost it.

1092
01:19:01.069 --> 01:19:03.697
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

1093
01:19:09.344 --> 01:19:11.938
- You are adorable when you are in love.
- Thank you.

1094
01:19:12.014 --> 01:19:15.313
- Tell us all about her.
- She's great. She's really terrific.

1095
01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:17.045
So it's complicated.

1096
01:19:17.119 --> 01:19:19.383
Yeah, you were saying
that-that she's complex, I guess.

1097
01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:21.285
Shut up!

1098
01:19:29.898 --> 01:19:33.163
- Ow!
- You're insane. Tom Ryan is insane!

1099
01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:35.260
- I'm insane!
- Are you happy?

1100
01:19:35.337 --> 01:19:37.305
- You're happy?
- I'm so happy. Hey! Look!

1101
01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:42.105
Whoa!

1102
01:19:42.177 --> 01:19:44.168
Tom. Okay, you've got balls.

1103
01:19:46.748 --> 01:19:50.309
Yeah!

1104
01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:52.182
Shoe!

1105
01:19:57.025 --> 01:19:59.516
I love Cindy Campbell!

1106
01:19:59.595 --> 01:20:02.029
I can jump on things!

1107
01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:05.033
Whoa!

1108
01:20:08.503 --> 01:20:11.734
Wowee-wowee-wowee-wowee-wowee!

1109
01:20:11.807 --> 01:20:13.741
Wowee- wowee-wowee-wowee!

1110
01:20:13.809 --> 01:20:17.142
Ya-ha! Whoa!

1111
01:20:21.450 --> 01:20:23.247
Okay, um, Tom...
isn't Cindy here?

1112
01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:26.082
I know she's here.
Cindy, I know you're in the building.

1113
01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:28.486
- Cindy! Cindy!
- Cindy! Cindy!

1114
01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:33.551
- Let's bring her out right now!
- I love this woman! I love this woman!

1115
01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:45.006
Oh, God! God!

1116
01:20:45.073 --> 01:20:48.008
Oh, God!
