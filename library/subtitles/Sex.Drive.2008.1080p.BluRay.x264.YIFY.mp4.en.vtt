Hello, my name is Sean Anders.
Screenwriter and director of <i>Sex Drive. </i>

00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:14.246
Hi, John. I didn't see you there.

00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:19.157
-This is John Morris.
-Screenwriter and producer of <i>Sex Drive. </i>

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.060
-Welcome to the unrated...
-Uncircumcised...

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.427
...edition of...

00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:25.398
<i>-... Sex Drive.
-Sex Drive. </i>

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:27.958
How many times has this happened to you?

00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:32.370
You purchase an unrated DVD to view
with your friends. Only with your friends...

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.570
Only to find that you got the same
old movie with a few extra curse words,

00:00:36.644 --> 00:00:38.942
and maybe an additional tit or two.

00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:41.073
-What a jip.
-And how...

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.480
Not this time.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.714
That's right, John.
On this unrated DVD we promise you,

00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:48.119
the viewer,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.149
a genuinely wacky, zany
and unrated viewing experience.

00:00:53.228 --> 00:00:56.129
-We promise...
-Plus, we promise more tits.

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:58.461
Bare tits like these.

00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:02.032
These tits are good.

00:01:03.038 --> 00:01:06.007
Plus, more cock, like this.

00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:09.042
That's good cock, John.

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:13.777
That's right, John, and that's not all,
we promise lots of additional scenes,

00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:18.182
takes and other bullshit
that will make the movie way too long.

00:01:18.253 --> 00:01:21.017
And this means a lower standard
of filmmaking for you,

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:22.078
-the viewer.
-The viewer.

00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:26.851
So, if you've never seen <i>Sex Drive</i> before,
please, for real,

00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:29.396
do not watch this version first.

00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:33.195
Watch the real theatrical version
and then come back and watch this one.

00:01:33.268 --> 00:01:34.360
Why?

00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:38.998
Yes, because this version
of the movie is going to suck.

00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:50.073
Sorry, but I couldn't help but notice you.
I have this exact same tribal tattoo.

00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:52.119
Mine's one my... It's on my back.

00:01:52.187 --> 00:01:55.987
But actually I have a town car outside
if you wanna go see...

00:02:03.098 --> 00:02:05.293

Why don't you do one more?

IAN: We open up against Michigan
in two weeks.

00:02:30.525 --> 00:02:32.925
Coach's got me hitting the bench
pretty hard.

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.227
Shit. How much is a lot?

00:02:42.971 --> 00:02:45.064
One... No, two.

00:02:50.044 --> 00:02:52.911
I'm putting up three hundy.

00:03:01.756 --> 00:03:03.849
Well, let's see, Tasty.

00:03:07.162 --> 00:03:08.322
(EXHALES)

00:03:09.197 --> 00:03:10.289
Wow!

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:12.788
Um...

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.738
Wow, you're really pretty. I've never seen...

00:03:18.106 --> 00:03:19.300
No, stop it, stop it.

00:03:19.374 --> 00:03:23.140
Don't be so fucking desperate.
Come on, be a dick. Be cool.

00:03:32.554 --> 00:03:33.782
Not bad.

00:03:35.223 --> 00:03:36.383
I've seen better.

00:03:41.796 --> 00:03:43.354
Yeah, whatever.

00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:49.027
Coach's got us running two-a-days,
so I gotta bounce.

Ian, wake up, faggot. Judge rolls in 20,

00:05:40.415 --> 00:05:42.474
so if you want a ride to work
you better get your poop in a group.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.677
-Okay, I'll be right down.
-No. Now, Clay Aiken.

-All right.
-No, now, homo.

00:05:46.821 --> 00:05:48.846

-No, no, no, no. Now, sissy.

-Just...
-No, now, chode-stroker.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.350
Now, ball bag.

Hey...

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:04.768
-Ow! Cut it out.
-Hurts, doesn't it?

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.966
Shut up! I'm trying to sleep.

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:11.209
Hey, Big D, sorry. Go back to sleep.
You're golden.

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:14.009
-You, get your ass up.
-Give me a minute.

00:06:14.248 --> 00:06:15.772
What're you doing under there, huh?

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:19.286
What're you doing?
You're firing off your skin pistol?

00:06:19.687 --> 00:06:21.348
Come on, get up. What are you hiding?

00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:23.413
You got a big fattie under there, don't you?

00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:27.723
Yeah, you do. You're stroking it, too.
What the F?

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:32.432
Your little brother's sleeping
not ten feet away. Jesus Christ!

Good. My boys are all here.

-Can it, Rex.

Hey, way to go!

00:06:54.922 --> 00:06:58.380
Ian, you wanna get off your duff
and come over here and give Karen a hug?

Um...

-Can we do that later?

-No, no, honey. It's okay.

-You queer?
-What?

-God damn it! I knew it!
-I didn't say anything.

Exactly. If someone asks you
if you're a pole smoker,

you just deny it, straight off.

Ian, you're 18,
and you've never had a girlfriend.

That's how people wind up getting gay,
you know.

the shaft or the balls?

-That's gross.
-You like them both, don't you?

It's like, sometimes like, Tuesdays you want
the big, old fucking shiny-ass cock,

00:08:53.875 --> 00:08:57.276
and Wednesdays and Thursdays
you're on to the balls.

like you can almost see your reflection
in that fucking cock.

but your whole trying too hard thing,

00:13:24.712 --> 00:13:27.374
it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:29.780
And I think you're better than that,
Kimberly.

00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.753
-But all I was saying was that...
-Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?

00:13:34.922 --> 00:13:36.913
I mean, Christ,
I'm out buying him clothes right now.

00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:40.859
He's 18 years old.
I don't have to do that shit anymore.

00:13:40.928 --> 00:13:45.456
Look, Judy, listen, I'm sorry,
I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.

00:13:47.067 --> 00:13:50.798
Well, it's official, Lance,
your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:53.169
What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.141
No, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.043
All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

00:13:59.113 --> 00:14:02.105
Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

00:14:02.183 --> 00:14:05.880
And whatever you do, man,
always wear a rubber. Christ.

00:14:05.953 --> 00:14:08.786
Nice. Always classy.

00:14:08.856 --> 00:14:12.622
Hey, come on, Lance, I didn't mean it like...
Come on, dawg.

00:14:16.297 --> 00:14:20.165
Hey, sir. I've got something yummy
for your little girl.

(SCREAMING)

00:14:22.736 --> 00:14:26.672

(WOMAN SCREAMS)

00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:36.072
-Ian? Oh, my God, dude, what happened?
-IAN: I don't know.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:38.550
Is there a cock and balls
on the front of me again?

00:14:38.619 --> 00:14:41.110
-Like a little tree trunk.
-IAN: Thank you.

00:14:42.256 --> 00:14:44.121
Oh, my God.

00:14:47.094 --> 00:14:51.053
-Whoa. You look pretty.
-God, shut up, Ian!

00:14:51.131 --> 00:14:55.033
What? I'm just saying,
you usually dress so... You look nice.

00:14:55.102 --> 00:14:57.434
Ian, why do you got to work the mouth
when you talk to us?

00:14:57.504 --> 00:15:00.996
-Yeah, Ian.
-Sorry, it's a... It's a habit.

00:15:01.075 --> 00:15:04.101
Hey, that girl you work with, Becca,
you gonna bring her to my party tonight?

00:15:04.178 --> 00:15:08.877
-Yeah, I asked her. She said no.
-Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.

00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:11.417
That's what you say about everyone.

00:15:11.485 --> 00:15:13.476
She made you wear
the fucking costume again, right?

00:15:13.554 --> 00:15:15.988
-You know, I don't mind...
-Dude, if you told her to fuck off,

00:15:16.056 --> 00:15:19.389
she'd be two knuckles deep right now
daydreaming about your big black cock.

00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:20.654
Ian, do not listen to him.

00:15:20.728 --> 00:15:23.424
Okay, girls want a nice guy
who's gonna treat them well.

00:15:23.497 --> 00:15:25.124
-Really?
-Yes. Really.

00:15:25.199 --> 00:15:27.429
Look, all I'm saying is
everybody wants a challenge.

00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:29.901
-Everybody wants...
-What they can't get. I know, I got it.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.303
Do you get it? 'Cause I mean, it feels like
I'm teaching you to walk sometimes.

00:15:33.374 --> 00:15:37.367
-That shit does not work.
-It works on you.

00:15:37.444 --> 00:15:39.207
No, it doesn't.

00:15:43.817 --> 00:15:45.284
Felicia!

00:15:45.552 --> 00:15:49.318
Balls! I got to go.
Evil cousin's spending the weekend.

00:15:49.390 --> 00:15:52.257
-Pretty cousin?
-Ian, she's the anti-Christ.

00:15:52.326 --> 00:15:55.454
-She's still super hot.
-Fuck you, too. See you.

00:15:56.497 --> 00:15:57.589
So what happened with Becca?

00:15:57.665 --> 00:15:59.257
You been doing like I told you,
being a dick?

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:03.793
Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick.
I'd say... No, not really.

00:16:04.738 --> 00:16:06.706
I mean, you know,
I've sort of been practicing

00:16:06.774 --> 00:16:09.971
your whole being-a-dick thing
with this girl I met online.

00:16:10.044 --> 00:16:12.012
-And I get it, but I just...
-Thanks.

00:16:12.079 --> 00:16:13.910
I don't think I could do that for real.

00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:16.074
Dude, sure you can.
I believe in you, you know.

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.916
You just got to stop worrying
about being the good guy all the time.

00:16:19.987 --> 00:16:22.080
I mean, okay,
look at Andy and Randy over there.

00:16:22.156 --> 00:16:24.021
You think they care
what women think about them?

00:16:24.124 --> 00:16:26.024
They could give a fuck.

00:16:26.627 --> 00:16:29.357

-What's up, what's up?

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:32.797
Hi. I'm collecting for
the underprivileged children of Ecuador.

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:34.265
-Would you like to help?
-Not really.

00:16:34.368 --> 00:16:36.802
-We don't have any money.
-No jobs.

00:16:37.638 --> 00:16:39.105
You wanna party?

00:16:39.173 --> 00:16:41.334
Um... I'm kind of working right now.

00:16:41.408 --> 00:16:43.740
-When are you done?
-Yeah, what are you doing after?

00:16:43.811 --> 00:16:45.369
I have a church thing tonight.

00:16:45.446 --> 00:16:47.380
-Kick ass, we'll come.
-Yeah, where is it?

00:16:47.448 --> 00:16:49.473
Is there gonna be
more hot snatch like you there?

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:52.542
Those guys are total nards.
They never get anywhere.

00:16:52.619 --> 00:16:54.553
That's just 'cause they don't know
how to close.

00:16:54.621 --> 00:16:56.248
But they're ability to open
is fucking heroic.

00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.024
-Do you wear thong underpants?
-Do you want us to take our shirts off?

00:16:59.093 --> 00:17:01.425
-What color bra are you wearing?
-Is your mom hot, too?

00:17:01.495 --> 00:17:03.087
Are you into me?

00:17:03.163 --> 00:17:04.892
-Where do you live?
-What color car do you have?

00:17:04.965 --> 00:17:06.626
-Where do you live?
-What's your address?

00:17:06.734 --> 00:17:08.395
-Do you want us to come over?
-Do you like pizza?

00:17:08.469 --> 00:17:10.369
We've been to a motel.

00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:18.109
-Fuck off, donut.
-Rex, it's me.

00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:21.280
What the fuck is this all about?

00:17:21.348 --> 00:17:25.250
I broke the key off of our locker.
I couldn't get my clothes out.

00:17:25.319 --> 00:17:29.221
Stow that shit in the trunk.
Christ, you look like a Mexican butt-hole.

00:17:33.861 --> 00:17:35.726

00:17:39.299 --> 00:17:41.164
Becca? Hey.

00:17:41.635 --> 00:17:44.604
Wow, I didn't know
that you were coming over.

00:17:45.472 --> 00:17:50.637
Cool. I didn't even know
that you knew where I lived. I mean...

00:17:50.711 --> 00:17:53.373
-Yeah, I do.
-Yeah.

00:17:53.447 --> 00:17:56.883
-So...
-Oh! It's a funny story. I broke...

00:17:56.950 --> 00:18:00.750
I broke my key off
and Ron let me borrow the...

00:18:00.821 --> 00:18:04.552
Anyway, so this is great.
You changed your mind.

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:05.853
Now, the party, it doesn't start

00:18:05.926 --> 00:18:09.760
-for a few hours.
-Actually, I was wondering if Dylan's here.

00:18:12.099 --> 00:18:14.567
-Dylan?
-Yeah. Is he here?

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:17.035
-My 14-year-old brother Dylan?
-Yeah.

00:18:17.104 --> 00:18:22.064
-DYLAN: Nice underpants, Ian.
-Snap! Dang, that was funny.

00:18:22.142 --> 00:18:24.133
You know he's 14, right?

I love it.

-Hey, congrats. Good to see you.
-Hey.

00:19:03.450 --> 00:19:05.213
Is this the plan?

00:19:14.661 --> 00:19:18.927
Ian, dude, there's like 80 wet chicks here.
Get off your wallflower ass.

00:19:18.999 --> 00:19:21.968
-Are you smoking cigars now?
-Yes.

00:19:22.035 --> 00:19:25.300
-Hey, Lance. Tight party.
-Okay, rude.

00:19:25.372 --> 00:19:27.203
You can see
I'm having a conversation here.

00:19:27.274 --> 00:19:30.209
Now, I'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

00:19:30.277 --> 00:19:31.608
-Thank you.
-We're sorry.

00:19:31.678 --> 00:19:33.646
-Don't apologize to her.
-I'm sorry.

00:19:33.714 --> 00:19:35.409
Don't apologize to me.

who Felicia's talking to.

where you going?

00:19:50.764 --> 00:19:53.232

-Yeah. No. I don't know.

-You used to be on my paper route.
-Okay, sure. My mom likes you.

'cause that's where...

You know, I read that they have
a really great astronomy program.

00:20:40.414 --> 00:20:42.348
I don't know if that's
what you're going there for or...

00:20:42.416 --> 00:20:48.082
Because it's really high elevation,
and you can see the stars really well...

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:52.220
Planets.

00:20:52.826 --> 00:20:56.318

That's really suggestive.

I'm not saying that
you're gonna do that on my, well...

-I asked you first.
-Nothing.

00:21:27.194 --> 00:21:30.960
No, I just... I spilled beer on my shirt,
so then I had to...

-Yeah, right. I wish.

at your place this weekend?

It'll be fun.

-Yeah.

-I'm 25 years old.
-I don't know what he's talking about.

00:48:39.591 --> 00:48:44.153
I got nothing. There's no bars.
You know, it probably just needs water.

00:48:44.463 --> 00:48:45.987
Got any in the trunk?

00:48:46.198 --> 00:48:48.792
Hey, sweetheart, men are talking.
We got this one.

00:48:48.867 --> 00:48:51.836
Yeah, thanks,
but this happened to my brother's car once

Hi. I'm Amanda Crew, professional actor.

02:09:06.446 --> 02:09:08.778
You know in all the teen unrated DVDs,

02:09:08.849 --> 02:09:12.410
you never really get to see
the star's naughty parts.

02:09:12.886 --> 02:09:16.322
Well, that is gonna change today.

02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:18.290
That's right. Take a seat,

02:09:18.358 --> 02:09:21.191
maybe close the door
so mom doesn't come in.

02:09:21.261 --> 02:09:24.162
Get all ready. Looks good.

02:09:25.565 --> 02:09:26.896
Here we go.

02:09:30.637 --> 02:09:32.127
Suckers!

02:09:33.774 --> 02:09:35.071
This is serious matter.

02:09:36.176 --> 02:09:37.336
Run for your life.

02:09:37.411 --> 02:09:40.005
MAN 1: Oh, shit! You know what?
We see the fake balls on the table there.

02:09:40.080 --> 02:09:41.104
(ALL LAUGHING)

02:09:41.181 --> 02:09:43.911
MAN 2: All right. We'll shoot another. Cut.
MAN 3: Cut.
