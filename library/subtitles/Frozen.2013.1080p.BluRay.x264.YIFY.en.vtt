00:01:20.817 --> 00:01:34.042
<font color="#00ffff">FROZEN</font>

2
00:01:52.846 --> 00:01:59.072
Born of cold and winter air
and mountain rain combining.

3
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:03.574
This icy force
both foul and fair.

4
00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:07.379
Has a frozen heart worth mining.

5
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.073
So cut through the heart,
cold and clear.

6
00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:14.359
Strike for love and
strike for fear.

7
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.246
See the beauty sharp and sheer.

8
00:02:17.247 --> 00:02:23.554
Split the ice apart
and break the frozen heart.

9
00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:27.178
Ho! Watch your step!
Let it go!

10
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.303
Ho! Watch your step!
Let it go!

11
00:02:32.122 --> 00:02:33.387
Beautiful! Powerful!

12
00:02:33.388 --> 00:02:34.583
Dangerous! Cold!

13
00:02:34.584 --> 00:02:36.966
Ice has a magic can't be controlled.

14
00:02:36.967 --> 00:02:39.219
Stronger than one, stronger than ten

15
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.771
Stronger than a hundred men!

16
00:02:44.613 --> 00:02:49.838
Born of cold and winter air
and mountain rain combining.

17
00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:52.021
This icy force
both foul and fair

18
00:02:52.022 --> 00:02:54.503
has a frozen heart worth mining.

19
00:02:54.624 --> 00:02:57.116
Cut through the heart,
cold and clear.

20
00:02:57.117 --> 00:02:59.642
Strike for love and strike for fear.

21
00:02:59.643 --> 00:03:01.968
There's beauty and
there's danger here.

22
00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:04.326
Split the ice apart!

23
00:03:04.327 --> 00:03:10.037
Beware the frozen heart.

24
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:16.203
Come on, Sven!

25
00:03:41.286 --> 00:03:43.689
Elsa. Psst

26
00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.812
Elsa!

27
00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:49.214
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

28
00:03:49.215 --> 00:03:52.297
Anna, go back to sleep.

29
00:03:52.797 --> 00:03:57.416
I just can't. The sky's
awake, so I'm awake,

30
00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.955
so we have to play.

31
00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:02.726
Go play by yourself.

32
00:04:08.372 --> 00:04:11.115
Do you want to build a snowman?

33
00:04:12.095 --> 00:04:14.639
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

34
00:04:18.141 --> 00:04:21.424
Do the magic! Do the magic!

35
00:04:26.149 --> 00:04:27.430
- Ready?
- Uhhm...

36
00:04:31.473 --> 00:04:34.117
This is amazing!

37
00:04:36.099 --> 00:04:38.240
Watch this!

38
00:04:45.868 --> 00:04:48.989
Hi, I'm Olaf and I
like warm hugs.

39
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.553
I love you, Olaf.

40
00:05:02.582 --> 00:05:05.825
- Alright. - Catch me!
- Gotcha!

41
00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:09.390
- Again!
- Wait!

42
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.492
Slow down!

43
00:05:13.873 --> 00:05:16.615
Anna!

44
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.602
Anna?

45
00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:26.967
Mama! Papa!

46
00:05:34.552 --> 00:05:37.815
You ok, Anna.
I Got you.

47
00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:42.334
Elsa, what have you done?
This is getting out of hand!

48
00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:46.025
It was an accident. I'm sorry,
Anna.

49
00:05:46.404 --> 00:05:50.148
- She's ice cold.
- I know where we have to go.

50
00:06:09.445 --> 00:06:11.167
Ice?

51
00:06:11.168 --> 00:06:13.510
Faster, Sven!

52
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:17.073
Sven!

53
00:06:19.755 --> 00:06:22.078
Please... Help!

54
00:06:22.538 --> 00:06:24.399
My daughter!

55
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.031
He is the king!

56
00:06:38.714 --> 00:06:40.554
Trolls...?

57
00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:43.317
Shush. I'm trying to listen.

58
00:06:43.417 --> 00:06:46.960
Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

59
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:48.902
Your Majesty!

60
00:06:48.903 --> 00:06:51.365
Born with the powers or cursed?

61
00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:54.128
Born. And they're
getting stronger.

62
00:06:56.711 --> 00:06:59.547
You are lucky it
wasn't her heart.

63
00:06:59.548 --> 00:07:02.349
The heart is not
so easily changed,

64
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.012
But the head can be persuaded.

65
00:07:05.013 --> 00:07:06.819
Do what you must.

66
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:09.662
I recommend we remove all magic,

67
00:07:09.663 --> 00:07:13.565
even memories of magic to be
safe...

68
00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:18.630
But don't worry,
I'll leave the fun.

69
00:07:22.934 --> 00:07:24.996
She will be okay.

70
00:07:24.997 --> 00:07:27.973
But she won't remember I have
powers?

71
00:07:27.974 --> 00:07:30.941
- It's for the best.
- Listen to me, Elsa,

72
00:07:30.942 --> 00:07:34.426
your power will only grow.

73
00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:37.767
There is beauty in it...

74
00:07:38.549 --> 00:07:41.471
But also great danger.

75
00:07:41.472 --> 00:07:44.049
You must learn to control it.

76
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.617
Fear will be your enemy.

77
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.742
No. We'll protect her. She can
learn to control it. I'm sure.

78
00:07:53.764 --> 00:07:55.444
Until then,

79
00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:59.068
we'll lock the gates.
We'll reduce the staff.

80
00:07:59.108 --> 00:08:02.270
We will limit her
contact with people,

81
00:08:02.271 --> 00:08:05.474
and keep her powers
hidden from everyone.

82
00:08:07.916 --> 00:08:10.479
Including Anna.

83
00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:22.470
Elsa?

84
00:08:24.211 --> 00:08:27.594
Do you want to build a snowman?

85
00:08:27.595 --> 00:08:30.838
Come on let's go and play.

86
00:08:30.839 --> 00:08:34.335
I never see you anymore.
Come out the door.

87
00:08:34.336 --> 00:08:37.378
It's like you've gone away.

88
00:08:37.379 --> 00:08:39.885
We used to be best buddies,

89
00:08:39.886 --> 00:08:45.252
and now we're not.
I wish you would tell me why.

90
00:08:45.432 --> 00:08:48.533
Do you want to build a snowman?

91
00:08:48.534 --> 00:08:50.576
It doesn't have
to be a snowman.

92
00:08:50.577 --> 00:08:52.837
Go away, Anna.

93
00:08:52.838 --> 00:08:55.923
Okay bye.

94
00:09:01.687 --> 00:09:04.588
The gloves will help.
See...

95
00:09:04.589 --> 00:09:07.366
- Conceal it.
- Don't feel it.

96
00:09:07.367 --> 00:09:09.694
Don't let it show.

97
00:09:11.957 --> 00:09:14.843
Do you want to build a snowman?

98
00:09:14.844 --> 00:09:17.962
Or ride our bike
around the halls?

99
00:09:18.142 --> 00:09:20.342
I think some company
is overdue...

100
00:09:20.343 --> 00:09:23.401
I've started talking to
the pictures on the walls.

101
00:09:23.402 --> 00:09:24.547
Hang in there, Joan.

102
00:09:24.548 --> 00:09:28.145
It gets a little lonely
all these empty rooms.

103
00:09:28.146 --> 00:09:32.136
Just watching the hours tick by.

104
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:39.697
I'm scared. It's
getting stronger.

105
00:09:39.698 --> 00:09:40.984
Getting upset only
makes it worse.

106
00:09:40.985 --> 00:09:42.304
Calm down.

107
00:09:42.305 --> 00:09:46.788
No. Don't touch me. Please.
I don't want to hurt you.

108
00:09:54.116 --> 00:09:56.358
See you in two weeks.

109
00:09:58.021 --> 00:10:02.024
- Do you have to go?
- You'll be fine, Elsa.

110
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.501
Elsa?

111
00:10:42.502 --> 00:10:46.025
Please, I know you're in there

112
00:10:46.305 --> 00:10:49.427
People are asking
where you've been,

113
00:10:50.308 --> 00:10:53.731
They say have courage
and i'm trying to...

114
00:10:53.732 --> 00:10:58.576
I'm right out here for you.
Just let me in.

115
00:10:59.076 --> 00:11:01.498
We only have each other.

116
00:11:01.499 --> 00:11:03.801
It's just you and me.

117
00:11:03.802 --> 00:11:07.344
What are we gonna do?

118
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:14.911
Do you want to build a snowman?

119
00:11:39.494 --> 00:11:43.397
Three Years Later

120
00:11:50.505 --> 00:11:53.321
- Welcome to Arendelle!
- Thank you, sir!

121
00:11:53.322 --> 00:11:56.210
Watch your Steps please.
The Gates Will opening Soon.

122
00:11:56.211 --> 00:11:58.032
Why do I have to wear this?

123
00:11:58.033 --> 00:12:00.015
Because the Queen
has come of age.

124
00:12:00.016 --> 00:12:02.030
It's Coronation Day!

125
00:12:02.031 --> 00:12:04.598
That's not my fault.

126
00:12:11.164 --> 00:12:14.067
- What do you want, Sven?
- Give me a snack!

127
00:12:14.068 --> 00:12:17.169
- What's the magic word?
- Please!

128
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:19.591
A.. a... a... a! Share!

129
00:12:19.673 --> 00:12:22.710
I can't believe they're
finally opening up the gates!

130
00:12:22.711 --> 00:12:24.891
And for a whole day!

131
00:12:24.892 --> 00:12:26.678
Faster, Persi!

132
00:12:26.679 --> 00:12:31.664
Ah, Arendelle, our most
mysterious trade partner.

133
00:12:31.665 --> 00:12:34.632
Open those gates so
I may unlock your secrets

134
00:12:34.633 --> 00:12:36.647
and exploit your riches.

135
00:12:36.648 --> 00:12:38.348
Did I just say that out loud?

136
00:12:38.349 --> 00:12:39.982
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to

137
00:12:39.983 --> 00:12:41.648
see the Queen and the Princess.

138
00:12:41.649 --> 00:12:43.829
I bet they're absolutely lovely.

139
00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.797
I bet they are beautiful.

140
00:12:50.682 --> 00:12:52.542
Princess Anna...?

141
00:12:53.204 --> 00:12:55.265
Huh? Yeah?

142
00:12:55.425 --> 00:12:58.009
- Sorry to wake you, ma'am but...
- No, no, no. You didn't.

143
00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:00.891
I've been up for hours.

144
00:13:04.995 --> 00:13:06.295
Who is it?

145
00:13:06.296 --> 00:13:09.557
It's still me, ma'am.
The gates will open soon.

146
00:13:09.558 --> 00:13:12.462
- Time to get ready.
- Of course!

147
00:13:12.982 --> 00:13:14.623
Ready for what?

148
00:13:14.624 --> 00:13:16.800
Your sister's coronation, ma'am.

149
00:13:16.801 --> 00:13:20.069
My sister's cor-neration...

150
00:13:22.431 --> 00:13:24.892
It's coronation day!

151
00:13:26.195 --> 00:13:28.457
It's coronation day!

152
00:13:29.438 --> 00:13:31.814
The window is open!
So's that door!

153
00:13:31.815 --> 00:13:34.367
I didn't know they
did that anymore.

154
00:13:34.368 --> 00:13:38.725
Who knew we owned
8000 salad plates...?

155
00:13:38.786 --> 00:13:41.422
For years I have roamed
these empty halls

156
00:13:41.423 --> 00:13:43.618
Why have a ballroom
with no balls?

157
00:13:43.619 --> 00:13:48.115
Finally, they're
opening up the gates!

158
00:13:48.235 --> 00:13:50.912
There'll be real,
actual people -

159
00:13:50.913 --> 00:13:53.239
It'll be totally strange.

160
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:57.302
But wow am I so ready
for this change!

161
00:13:57.303 --> 00:14:02.067
For the first time in forever,

162
00:14:02.068 --> 00:14:06.491
There'll be music,
there'll be light.

163
00:14:06.492 --> 00:14:11.116
For the first time in forever,

164
00:14:11.117 --> 00:14:16.021
I'll be dancing
through the night.

165
00:14:16.022 --> 00:14:18.110
Don't know if i'm
elated or gassy,

166
00:14:18.111 --> 00:14:21.212
But i'm somewhere in that zone

167
00:14:21.213 --> 00:14:26.890
'Cause for the first
time in forever,

168
00:14:27.872 --> 00:14:32.616
I won't be alone. I can't
wait to meet everyone...

169
00:14:33.077 --> 00:14:35.378
What if I meet "the one"?

170
00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:38.406
Tonight, imagine me gown and all

171
00:14:38.407 --> 00:14:40.732
Fetchingly draped
against the wall.

172
00:14:40.733 --> 00:14:45.249
The picture of
sophisticated grace.

173
00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:47.891
I suddenly see him
standing there,

174
00:14:47.892 --> 00:14:50.292
a beautiful stranger
tall and fair.

175
00:14:50.293 --> 00:14:54.777
I wanna stuff some
chocolate in my face!

176
00:14:54.778 --> 00:14:57.274
But then we laugh and
talk all evening,

177
00:14:57.275 --> 00:14:59.861
Which is totally bizarre.

178
00:14:59.862 --> 00:15:04.046
Nothing like the life
i've led so far.

179
00:15:04.125 --> 00:15:08.310
For the first time in forever,

180
00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:13.254
There'll be magic,
There'll be fun.

181
00:15:13.274 --> 00:15:17.577
For the first time in forever,

182
00:15:17.578 --> 00:15:22.363
I could be noticed by someone.

183
00:15:22.364 --> 00:15:24.985
And I know it is totally crazy

184
00:15:24.986 --> 00:15:27.988
To dream i'd find romance.

185
00:15:27.989 --> 00:15:33.473
But for the first time in forever,

186
00:15:34.175 --> 00:15:37.297
At least I've got a chance!

187
00:15:42.903 --> 00:15:47.201
Don't let them in.
Don't let them see.

188
00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:51.731
Be the good girl
You always have to be.

189
00:15:52.833 --> 00:15:56.553
Conceal. Don't feel.

190
00:15:56.554 --> 00:15:58.918
Put on a show.

191
00:15:58.919 --> 00:16:03.302
Make one wrong move
and everyone will know.

192
00:16:04.222 --> 00:16:05.783
But it's only for today.

193
00:16:05.784 --> 00:16:08.200
It's only for today!
It's agony to wait.

194
00:16:08.201 --> 00:16:09.967
It's agony to wait.

195
00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:13.345
Tell the guards
to open up the...

196
00:16:13.346 --> 00:16:16.354
The gate!

197
00:16:17.856 --> 00:16:20.028
For the first time in forever.

198
00:16:20.029 --> 00:16:22.213
Don't let them in
don't let them see

199
00:16:22.214 --> 00:16:25.632
I'm getting what
i'm dreaming of.

200
00:16:25.633 --> 00:16:27.839
Be the good girl you
always have to be

201
00:16:27.840 --> 00:16:31.318
A chance to change
my Only world

202
00:16:31.319 --> 00:16:33.489
Conceal. Conceal. Don't feel.

203
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:38.154
- A chance to find true love
- Don't See, Don't Feel, Don't Let them know.

204
00:16:38.155 --> 00:16:41.130
I know it all ends tomorrow,

205
00:16:41.131 --> 00:16:44.279
So it has to be today!

206
00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:49.299
Cause for the first
time in forever...

207
00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:55.311
For the first time in forever!

208
00:16:56.451 --> 00:17:01.496
Nothing's in my way!

209
00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:09.123
- Hey!
- I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

210
00:17:09.581 --> 00:17:10.482
Hey!

211
00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:14.408
- I-ya, no. No. I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

212
00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:17.108
Yeah, I just wasn't looking
where I was going.

213
00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:21.675
- But I'm great, actually.
- Oh, thank goodness.

214
00:17:26.479 --> 00:17:29.002
Prince Hans of the
Southern Isles.

215
00:17:29.042 --> 00:17:31.859
- Princess Anna of Arendelle.
- Princess...?

216
00:17:31.860 --> 00:17:33.967
My Lady.

217
00:17:37.029 --> 00:17:39.172
Hi... again.

218
00:17:39.311 --> 00:17:40.872
Oh boy.

219
00:17:40.873 --> 00:17:42.905
Ha. This is awkward.
Not you're awkward,

220
00:17:42.906 --> 00:17:44.970
but just because
we're... I'm awkward.

221
00:17:44.971 --> 00:17:46.436
You're gorgeous. Wait, what?

222
00:17:46.437 --> 00:17:47.720
I'd like to formally
apologize for

223
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:50.622
hitting the Princess of
Arendelle with my horse...

224
00:17:50.623 --> 00:17:52.522
And for every moment after.

225
00:17:52.523 --> 00:17:55.400
No. No-no. It's fine.
I'm not THAT Princess.

226
00:17:55.401 --> 00:17:58.210
I mean, if you'd hit my
sister Elsa, that would be...

227
00:17:58.211 --> 00:18:00.011
‘Cuz, you know...

228
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:01.792
Hello.

229
00:18:01.793 --> 00:18:05.796
But, lucky you,
it's-it's just me.

230
00:18:05.977 --> 00:18:07.898
Just you?

231
00:18:14.585 --> 00:18:16.467
The bells. The coronation.

232
00:18:16.468 --> 00:18:17.887
I... I...

233
00:18:17.888 --> 00:18:21.550
I better go. I
have to... I better go.

234
00:18:21.651 --> 00:18:23.453
Bye!

235
00:19:08.575 --> 00:19:11.818
Your Majesty, the gloves.

236
00:19:30.609 --> 00:19:34.026
[formal, in Old Norse] Sehm hon
hell drr in-um hell-gum Ayg-num ok

237
00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:41.584
krund ee thes-um hellgah Stahth,
ehk teh frahm fur-ear Uthear...

238
00:19:41.585 --> 00:19:44.884
...Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

239
00:19:44.885 --> 00:19:48.412
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

240
00:20:05.089 --> 00:20:08.031
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

241
00:20:09.532 --> 00:20:13.276
Princess Anna of Arendelle!

242
00:20:17.199 --> 00:20:21.604
Here? Are you sure? I do not
think I suppose to... Okay

243
00:20:29.831 --> 00:20:31.732
Hi.

244
00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:35.396
Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

245
00:20:37.218 --> 00:20:39.620
- You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

246
00:20:39.621 --> 00:20:41.761
You look beautifuller.
I mean, not fuller.

247
00:20:41.762 --> 00:20:43.924
You don't look fuller,
but more beautiful.

248
00:20:43.925 --> 00:20:46.047
Thank you.

249
00:20:46.266 --> 00:20:49.849
So, this is what a
party looks like?

250
00:20:50.851 --> 00:20:52.104
It's warmer than I thought.

251
00:20:52.105 --> 00:20:56.116
And what is that amazing smell?

252
00:20:56.176 --> 00:20:59.879
Chocolate.

253
00:21:02.561 --> 00:21:06.065
Your Majesty. The
Duke of Weaseltown.

254
00:21:06.066 --> 00:21:07.698
Weselton. The
Duke of Weselton..

255
00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:09.587
Your Majesty,

256
00:21:09.588 --> 00:21:11.990
As your closest
partner in trade,

257
00:21:11.991 --> 00:21:13.234
It seems only fitting
that I offer you

258
00:21:13.235 --> 00:21:15.995
Your first dance as queen.

259
00:21:23.041 --> 00:21:25.427
Thank you... Only I don't dance.

260
00:21:25.428 --> 00:21:28.046
But my sister does.

261
00:21:28.647 --> 00:21:30.788
- Lucky you...
- Oh, I don't think...

262
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:33.525
If you swoon, let me
know, I'll catch you.

263
00:21:33.526 --> 00:21:35.032
Sorry.

264
00:21:35.033 --> 00:21:38.015
Like an agile peacock...

265
00:21:38.656 --> 00:21:41.797
Speaking of, so great
to have the gates open.

266
00:21:41.798 --> 00:21:44.175
Why did they shut them
in the first place?

267
00:21:44.176 --> 00:21:46.443
Do you know the
reason? Hmm?

268
00:21:46.784 --> 00:21:48.603
- No.
- No..

269
00:21:48.604 --> 00:21:50.225
Oh, all right. Hang on.

270
00:21:50.226 --> 00:21:52.684
They don't call me "the
little dipper" for nothing.

271
00:21:52.685 --> 00:21:58.374
Like a chicken... with the
face of a monkey... I fly.

272
00:21:59.435 --> 00:22:02.118
Let me know when you're ready
for another round, M'Lady.

273
00:22:03.175 --> 00:22:05.340
Well, he was sprightly.

274
00:22:05.341 --> 00:22:07.421
Especially for a man in heels.

275
00:22:07.422 --> 00:22:11.641
- Are you okay?
- I've never been better.

276
00:22:11.642 --> 00:22:13.828
This is so nice.

277
00:22:13.829 --> 00:22:16.609
I wish it could be like this
all the time.

278
00:22:16.610 --> 00:22:18.693
Me too...

279
00:22:21.616 --> 00:22:22.737
But it can't.

280
00:22:22.738 --> 00:22:25.980
- Why not? If...
- It just can't.

281
00:22:29.844 --> 00:22:32.006
Excuse me for a minute.

282
00:22:40.674 --> 00:22:43.256
- Glad I caught you.
- Hans!

283
00:22:53.225 --> 00:22:58.930
I often had the whole parlor to
myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

284
00:22:58.931 --> 00:23:01.732
Your physique helps I'm sure too.

285
00:23:06.378 --> 00:23:09.079
- What's this?
- I was born with it,

286
00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:11.496
Although I dreamt I was
kissed by a troll.

287
00:23:11.497 --> 00:23:12.943
I like it.

288
00:23:12.944 --> 00:23:15.866
Yeah, The whole thing!
You got it.

289
00:23:16.107 --> 00:23:18.944
Okay wait, wait. So you
have how many brothers?

290
00:23:18.945 --> 00:23:21.131
Twelve older brothers.

291
00:23:21.132 --> 00:23:23.629
Three of them pretended
I was invisible...

292
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:25.955
literally... for two years.

293
00:23:25.956 --> 00:23:28.733
- That's horrible.
- It's what brothers do.

294
00:23:28.734 --> 00:23:30.459
And sisters.

295
00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:32.413
Elsa and I were really
close when we were little.

296
00:23:32.414 --> 00:23:37.307
But then, one day
she just shut me out, and...

297
00:23:37.526 --> 00:23:39.308
And I never knew why.

298
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:41.830
I would never shut you out.

299
00:23:43.753 --> 00:23:46.650
Okay, can I just say
something crazy?

300
00:23:46.651 --> 00:23:48.156
I love crazy.

301
00:23:48.157 --> 00:23:52.781
All my life has been a
series of doors in my face.

302
00:23:52.782 --> 00:23:55.924
And then suddenly
I bump into you.

303
00:23:55.925 --> 00:23:58.086
I was thinking the same thing,
because like...

304
00:23:58.087 --> 00:24:02.530
I've been searching my whole
life to find my own place.

305
00:24:02.550 --> 00:24:04.683
And maybe it's the
party talking,

306
00:24:04.684 --> 00:24:06.849
Or the chocolate fondue.

307
00:24:06.850 --> 00:24:08.994
- But with you...
- But with you...

308
00:24:08.995 --> 00:24:10.601
I found my place.

309
00:24:10.602 --> 00:24:12.103
I see your face.

310
00:24:12.104 --> 00:24:16.103
And it's nothing like
i've ever known before.

311
00:24:16.104 --> 00:24:20.367
Love is an open... door!

312
00:24:20.887 --> 00:24:25.617
- Love is an open... door...
- Door...

313
00:24:25.618 --> 00:24:27.533
Love is an open... door...

314
00:24:27.534 --> 00:24:30.495
With you!
With you!

315
00:24:30.496 --> 00:24:34.560
Love is an open door.

316
00:24:40.847 --> 00:24:42.506
- I mean it's crazy.
- What?

317
00:24:42.507 --> 00:24:44.645
- We finish each other's...
- Sandwiches!

318
00:24:44.646 --> 00:24:46.010
That's what I was gonna say!

319
00:24:46.011 --> 00:24:49.068
I've never met someone...
Who thinks so much like me.

320
00:24:49.069 --> 00:24:50.675
Jinx... jinx again.

321
00:24:50.676 --> 00:24:55.699
Our Mental Synchronization
Can have but one explanation,

322
00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:59.638
You and I were
just meant to be.

323
00:24:59.639 --> 00:25:02.266
- Say goodbye.
- Say goodbye.

324
00:25:02.267 --> 00:25:05.288
To the pain of the past.

325
00:25:05.289 --> 00:25:08.886
We don't have to
feel it anymore!

326
00:25:08.887 --> 00:25:12.256
Love is an open... door!

327
00:25:13.678 --> 00:25:18.480
Love is an open door!

328
00:25:18.481 --> 00:25:23.400
Life can be so much more...
with you! With you!

329
00:25:23.401 --> 00:25:27.495
Love is an open... door.

330
00:25:28.732 --> 00:25:30.933
Can I say something crazy...?

331
00:25:31.094 --> 00:25:32.975
Will you marry me?

332
00:25:32.976 --> 00:25:35.196
Can I just say something
even crazier?

333
00:25:35.197 --> 00:25:36.938
Yes.

334
00:25:41.844 --> 00:25:45.706
Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we
just get around you there?

335
00:25:45.707 --> 00:25:47.743
Thank you.
Oh, there she is.

336
00:25:47.744 --> 00:25:50.351
Elsa! I mean... Queen...

337
00:25:50.352 --> 00:25:53.133
Me again.
May I present,

338
00:25:53.134 --> 00:25:55.631
Prince Hans of the
Southern Isles.

339
00:25:55.632 --> 00:25:57.497
Your Majesty.

340
00:25:57.498 --> 00:26:00.421
We would like...
your blessing...

341
00:26:00.721 --> 00:26:03.363
of... our marriage!

342
00:26:03.723 --> 00:26:05.745
- Marriage...?
- Yes!

343
00:26:05.746 --> 00:26:07.146
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

344
00:26:07.147 --> 00:26:09.308
Well, We haven't worked out
all the details ourselves.

345
00:26:09.309 --> 00:26:11.153
We'll need a few
days to plan the ceremony.

346
00:26:11.154 --> 00:26:12.234
Of course we'll have soup,

347
00:26:12.235 --> 00:26:13.452
roast, and ice cream and then...

348
00:26:13.453 --> 00:26:15.026
Wait. Would we live here?

349
00:26:15.027 --> 00:26:16.748
- Here?
- Absolutely!

350
00:26:16.749 --> 00:26:17.428
Anna...

351
00:26:17.429 --> 00:26:19.689
Oh, we can invite all twelve of
your brothers to stay with us...

352
00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:21.033
What? No, no, no, no, no.

353
00:26:21.034 --> 00:26:22.289
Of course we have the room. I don't know.
Some of them must...

354
00:26:22.290 --> 00:26:23.623
Wait. Slow down.

355
00:26:23.624 --> 00:26:25.314
No one's brothers
are staying here.

356
00:26:25.315 --> 00:26:27.245
No one is getting married.

357
00:26:27.246 --> 00:26:28.605
Wait, what?

358
00:26:28.606 --> 00:26:31.991
May I talk to you, please?
Alone.

359
00:26:32.171 --> 00:26:33.973
No. Whatever you
have to say, you...

360
00:26:33.974 --> 00:26:36.074
you can say to both of us.

361
00:26:36.434 --> 00:26:39.511
Fine. You can't marry
a man you just met.

362
00:26:39.512 --> 00:26:41.418
You Can if it's true love.

363
00:26:41.419 --> 00:26:43.340
Anna, what do you
know about true love?

364
00:26:43.341 --> 00:26:47.225
More than you. All you know
is how to shut people out.

365
00:26:48.285 --> 00:26:51.509
You asked for my blessing,
but my answer is no.

366
00:26:51.568 --> 00:26:53.770
Now, Excuse me.

367
00:26:53.771 --> 00:26:55.511
Your Majesty, if I
may ease your...

368
00:26:55.512 --> 00:26:58.174
No, you may not. And I-I
think you should go.

369
00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:00.091
The party is over.
Close the gates.

370
00:27:00.092 --> 00:27:01.217
Yes, Your Majesty.

371
00:27:01.218 --> 00:27:02.674
What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

372
00:27:02.675 --> 00:27:04.100
Give me my glove!

373
00:27:04.101 --> 00:27:08.024
Elsa, please. Please. I can't
live like this anymore.

374
00:27:09.325 --> 00:27:11.167
Then leave.

375
00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:17.733
What did I ever do to you?!

376
00:27:17.734 --> 00:27:19.477
Enough, Anna.

377
00:27:19.478 --> 00:27:21.255
No. Why? Why do
you shut me out?!

378
00:27:21.256 --> 00:27:23.068
Why do you shut the world out?!

379
00:27:23.069 --> 00:27:24.913
What are you so afraid of?!

380
00:27:24.914 --> 00:27:27.462
I said, enough!

381
00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:37.062
Sorcery. I knew there was

382
00:27:37.063 --> 00:27:39.653
something dubious going on here.

383
00:27:40.194 --> 00:27:42.296
Elsa...?

384
00:27:48.321 --> 00:27:50.403
There she is.

385
00:27:53.329 --> 00:27:55.297
Your Majesty! Long live the Queen!
Queen Elsa...

386
00:27:55.298 --> 00:27:57.363
Come drink with us.

387
00:27:57.364 --> 00:27:59.552
Queen Elsa.

388
00:28:01.635 --> 00:28:04.938
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

389
00:28:15.566 --> 00:28:17.287
There she is! Stop her!

390
00:28:17.288 --> 00:28:18.781
Please, just stay away from me.

391
00:28:18.782 --> 00:28:20.572
Stay away!

392
00:28:22.794 --> 00:28:25.616
Monster... Monster!

393
00:28:32.724 --> 00:28:35.125
Elsa!

394
00:28:39.931 --> 00:28:42.052
Elsa...

395
00:28:47.118 --> 00:28:49.379
Wait, please!

396
00:29:01.070 --> 00:29:02.986
Elsa, stop!

397
00:29:02.987 --> 00:29:05.135
- Anna!
- No.

398
00:29:10.779 --> 00:29:13.381
The fjord.

399
00:29:30.918 --> 00:29:33.238
- Snow?
- Snow?

400
00:29:33.239 --> 00:29:34.240
Yes, snow!

401
00:29:34.241 --> 00:29:36.442
- Are you all right?
- No.

402
00:29:36.443 --> 00:29:39.746
- Did you know?
- No.

403
00:29:40.006 --> 00:29:41.768
Look! It's snowing!
It's snowing!

404
00:29:41.769 --> 00:29:43.450
The Queen has cursed this land!

405
00:29:43.451 --> 00:29:45.166
She must be stopped!

406
00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:47.392
- You have to go after her.
- Wait, no!

407
00:29:47.393 --> 00:29:49.405
You! Is there sorcery
in you, too?

408
00:29:49.406 --> 00:29:51.556
Are you a monster, too?

409
00:29:51.557 --> 00:29:54.493
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

410
00:29:54.494 --> 00:29:56.742
That's right she is.

411
00:29:56.743 --> 00:29:58.561
In the best way.

412
00:29:58.562 --> 00:30:00.235
And my sister's not a monster.

413
00:30:00.236 --> 00:30:01.986
She nearly killed me.

414
00:30:01.987 --> 00:30:03.554
- You slipped on ice.
- Her ice!

415
00:30:03.555 --> 00:30:06.109
It was an accident.
She was scared.

416
00:30:06.110 --> 00:30:09.188
She didn't mean it. She
didn't mean any of this...

417
00:30:09.189 --> 00:30:11.463
Tonight was my
fault. I pushed her.

418
00:30:11.464 --> 00:30:14.166
So I'm the one that
needs to go after her.

419
00:30:14.167 --> 00:30:16.074
- What? - Yeah.
- Bring me my horse, please.

420
00:30:16.075 --> 00:30:18.562
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

421
00:30:18.563 --> 00:30:20.463
Elsa's not dangerous.

422
00:30:20.464 --> 00:30:22.360
I'll bring her back,
And I'll make this right.

423
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:24.107
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

424
00:30:24.108 --> 00:30:27.210
I need you here to take
care of Arendelle.

425
00:30:27.211 --> 00:30:29.213
On my honor.

426
00:30:30.694 --> 00:30:33.795
I leave Prince Hans in charge!

427
00:30:34.377 --> 00:30:36.659
Are you sure you can trust her?

428
00:30:36.660 --> 00:30:38.435
I don't want you getting hurt.

429
00:30:38.436 --> 00:30:40.242
She's my sister,

430
00:30:40.243 --> 00:30:42.544
She would never hurt me.

431
00:31:22.763 --> 00:31:25.945
The Snow glows white
on the mountain tonight,

432
00:31:25.946 --> 00:31:29.649
Not a footprint to be seen.

433
00:31:29.650 --> 00:31:32.911
A kingdom of isolation

434
00:31:32.912 --> 00:31:36.515
And it looks like i'm the queen.

435
00:31:37.355 --> 00:31:43.621
The wind is howling like
this swirling storm inside.

436
00:31:44.362 --> 00:31:49.588
Couldn't keep it in,
Heaven knows I tried...

437
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:54.786
Don't let them in,
Don't let them see,

438
00:31:54.787 --> 00:31:58.270
Be the good girl
you always have to be.

439
00:31:58.271 --> 00:32:03.241
Conceal, Don't feel,
Don't let them know.

440
00:32:04.381 --> 00:32:07.784
Well, Now they know.

441
00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:11.447
Let it go. Let it go.

442
00:32:11.448 --> 00:32:14.946
Can't hold it back anymore.

443
00:32:14.947 --> 00:32:18.314
Let it go. Let it go.

444
00:32:18.315 --> 00:32:22.337
Turn away and Slam the door.

445
00:32:22.538 --> 00:32:28.364
I don't care what
they're going to say.

446
00:32:29.025 --> 00:32:32.989
Let the storm rage on.

447
00:32:33.009 --> 00:32:36.772
The cold never
bothered me anyway.

448
00:32:40.315 --> 00:32:46.341
It's funny how some distance
makes everything seem small.

449
00:32:46.601 --> 00:32:50.038
And the fears that
once controlled me

450
00:32:50.039 --> 00:32:54.447
Can't get to me at all.

451
00:32:54.448 --> 00:32:57.991
It's time to see what I can do,

452
00:32:57.992 --> 00:33:01.533
To test the limits
and Break through.

453
00:33:01.534 --> 00:33:05.753
No right, No wrong,
No rules for me...

454
00:33:05.754 --> 00:33:08.421
I'm free!

455
00:33:09.163 --> 00:33:12.746
Let it go! Let it go!

456
00:33:12.747 --> 00:33:16.302
I am one with the wind and sky.

457
00:33:16.303 --> 00:33:19.864
Let it go! Let it go!

458
00:33:19.865 --> 00:33:23.655
You'll never see me cry.

459
00:33:23.876 --> 00:33:27.253
Here I stand and...

460
00:33:27.254 --> 00:33:30.561
Here I'll stay.

461
00:33:30.562 --> 00:33:34.606
Let the storm rage on...

462
00:33:42.253 --> 00:33:48.459
My power flurries through
the air into the ground.

463
00:33:49.299 --> 00:33:55.525
My soul is spiraling in frozen
fractals all around.

464
00:33:56.147 --> 00:34:02.431
And one thought crystallizes
like An icy blast...

465
00:34:02.812 --> 00:34:05.709
I'm never going back,

466
00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:10.420
the past is in the past!

467
00:34:10.421 --> 00:34:14.062
Let it go! Let it go!

468
00:34:14.063 --> 00:34:17.661
And i'll rise like
the break of dawn.

469
00:34:17.662 --> 00:34:21.149
Let it go! Let it go!

470
00:34:21.150 --> 00:34:25.274
That perfect girl is gone.

471
00:34:25.373 --> 00:34:31.340
Here I stand in
the light of day.

472
00:34:33.601 --> 00:34:38.885
Let the storm rage on!

473
00:34:39.327 --> 00:34:43.070
The cold never
bothered me anyway.

474
00:34:48.055 --> 00:34:52.379
Elsa! Elsa!

475
00:34:54.641 --> 00:34:56.642
Elsa, It's me, Anna...

476
00:34:56.643 --> 00:35:00.047
Your sister who didn't mean
to make you freeze the summer.

477
00:35:00.186 --> 00:35:03.789
I'm sorry. It's all
my f-f-fault.

478
00:35:05.451 --> 00:35:07.433
Of course, none of this
would have happened

479
00:35:07.434 --> 00:35:09.594
if she'd just told me
her secret... ha...

480
00:35:09.595 --> 00:35:12.237
She's a stinker.

481
00:35:16.742 --> 00:35:19.524
Oh no. No. No. No.
Come back. No.

482
00:35:20.245 --> 00:35:22.886
Oooo-kay

483
00:35:27.872 --> 00:35:30.654
Snow, it had to be snow,

484
00:35:30.655 --> 00:35:33.693
She couldn't have had
tr-tr-tropical magic

485
00:35:33.694 --> 00:35:37.841
that covered the f-f-fjords
in white sand and warm...

486
00:35:38.562 --> 00:35:40.504
Fire! Whoa!

487
00:36:04.667 --> 00:36:07.909
Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

488
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:09.972
Ooh! And sauna...

489
00:36:17.779 --> 00:36:19.340
Big summer blow out.

490
00:36:19.341 --> 00:36:21.642
Half off swimming suits, clogs,

491
00:36:21.643 --> 00:36:24.764
And a sun balm of my
own invention, yah?

492
00:36:25.306 --> 00:36:26.887
Oh, great.

493
00:36:26.888 --> 00:36:29.354
For now, how about boots,

494
00:36:29.355 --> 00:36:31.751
Winter boots... and dresses?

495
00:36:31.752 --> 00:36:34.534
That would be in our winter
department.

496
00:36:38.559 --> 00:36:42.722
Oh. Um, I was just wondering;
has another young woman,

497
00:36:42.723 --> 00:36:46.050
The Queen perhaps, I don't
know, passed through here?

498
00:36:46.051 --> 00:36:49.608
Only one crazy enough to be out
in this storm is you, dear.

499
00:36:56.095 --> 00:36:57.827
You and this fellow... Hoo hoo.

500
00:36:57.828 --> 00:36:59.857
Big summer blow out.

501
00:37:04.603 --> 00:37:06.584
- Carrots.
- Hah?

502
00:37:07.826 --> 00:37:09.586
Behind you.

503
00:37:09.587 --> 00:37:12.509
Oh, right. Excuse me.

504
00:37:12.690 --> 00:37:15.412
A real howler in July, Yes?

505
00:37:15.413 --> 00:37:17.535
Where ever could
it be coming from?

506
00:37:17.975 --> 00:37:20.076
The North Mountain.

507
00:37:20.077 --> 00:37:21.698
North Mountain.

508
00:37:21.759 --> 00:37:23.345
That'll be forty.

509
00:37:23.346 --> 00:37:24.862
Forty? No, ten.

510
00:37:24.863 --> 00:37:26.493
Oh dear, that's no good. See

511
00:37:26.494 --> 00:37:28.158
These are from our winter stock,

512
00:37:28.159 --> 00:37:30.165
where supply and demand
have a big problem.

513
00:37:30.166 --> 00:37:32.470
You want to talk about a
supply and demand problem?

514
00:37:32.471 --> 00:37:34.144
I sell ice for a living.

515
00:37:34.145 --> 00:37:36.100
Ooh, that's a rough business
to be in right now.

516
00:37:36.101 --> 00:37:38.354
I mean, that is really...

517
00:37:38.393 --> 00:37:39.734
Ahem. That's unfortunate.

518
00:37:39.735 --> 00:37:41.587
Still forty. But I
will throw in a

519
00:37:41.588 --> 00:37:43.739
visit to Oaken's sauna. Hoo hoo!

520
00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.021
Hi, family.

521
00:37:47.382 --> 00:37:50.090
Ten's all I got. Help me out.

522
00:37:50.091 --> 00:37:52.827
Ten will get you
this and no more.

523
00:37:52.828 --> 00:37:54.409
Okay, just tell me
one thing. What was

524
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:56.025
happening on the North Mountain?

525
00:37:56.026 --> 00:37:58.333
Did it seem magical?

526
00:37:58.954 --> 00:38:01.375
Yes! Now, back up

527
00:38:01.376 --> 00:38:03.577
while I deal with
this crook here.

528
00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:08.663
What did you call me?

529
00:38:08.723 --> 00:38:11.305
Okay. Okay, I'm-Ow! Whoa!

530
00:38:11.565 --> 00:38:13.827
Bye bye.

531
00:38:17.892 --> 00:38:20.974
No Sven, I didn't
get your carrots.

532
00:38:21.455 --> 00:38:23.836
But I did find us
a place to sleep.

533
00:38:23.837 --> 00:38:26.020
And it's free.

534
00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:28.621
I'm sorry about this violence.

535
00:38:28.622 --> 00:38:30.383
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

536
00:38:30.384 --> 00:38:32.178
So We'll have good feelings.

537
00:38:32.179 --> 00:38:34.627
Just the outfit and boots, yah?

538
00:38:44.758 --> 00:38:48.404
Reindeers are
better than people.

539
00:38:48.405 --> 00:38:51.982
Sven, Don't you
think that's true?

540
00:38:51.983 --> 00:38:55.280
Yeah, People will beat you
& Curse you & Cheat you.

541
00:38:55.281 --> 00:38:58.083
Every one of em's
bad, Except you.

542
00:38:58.084 --> 00:39:00.130
Oh, Thanks, Buddy.

543
00:39:00.131 --> 00:39:03.493
But People smell better than
Reindeers.

544
00:39:03.494 --> 00:39:07.416
Sven, Don't you think i'm right?

545
00:39:07.417 --> 00:39:11.360
That's once again true,
For all Except you

546
00:39:11.361 --> 00:39:14.684
You got me. Let's
call it a night.

547
00:39:14.685 --> 00:39:16.925
Good night.

548
00:39:16.926 --> 00:39:21.390
Don't let the Frostbite bite.

549
00:39:24.293 --> 00:39:26.340
Nice duet.

550
00:39:26.518 --> 00:39:27.719
Oh, it's just you.

551
00:39:27.722 --> 00:39:29.318
What do you want?

552
00:39:29.319 --> 00:39:32.081
I want you to take me
up the North Mountain.

553
00:39:34.663 --> 00:39:37.144
I don't take people places.

554
00:39:37.145 --> 00:39:38.987
Let me rephrase that...

555
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:42.481
Take me up the
North Mountain...

556
00:39:42.482 --> 00:39:44.272
Please.

557
00:39:50.097 --> 00:39:52.499
Look, I know how to
stop this winter.

558
00:39:54.702 --> 00:39:56.524
We leave at dawn...

559
00:39:56.625 --> 00:39:59.246
And you forgot
the carrots for Sven.

560
00:40:00.447 --> 00:40:02.869
Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't...

561
00:40:03.690 --> 00:40:06.974
We leave now. Right now.

562
00:40:18.284 --> 00:40:20.665
Hang on! We like to go fast!

563
00:40:20.666 --> 00:40:21.405
I like fast!

564
00:40:21.406 --> 00:40:24.681
Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down.
This is fresh lacquer.

565
00:40:24.682 --> 00:40:26.711
Seriously, were you
raised in a barn?

566
00:40:27.773 --> 00:40:30.835
Ew. No, I was
raised in a castle.

567
00:40:31.978 --> 00:40:35.675
So tell me, what made the
Queen go all ice-crazy?

568
00:40:35.676 --> 00:40:38.843
Oh well, it was all my fault.

569
00:40:38.844 --> 00:40:41.321
I got engaged but then she
freaked out because...

570
00:40:41.322 --> 00:40:43.623
I'd only just met him,
you know, that day.

571
00:40:43.624 --> 00:40:45.649
And she said she wouldn't
bless the marriage...

572
00:40:45.650 --> 00:40:49.471
Wait. You got engaged to
someone you just met that day?

573
00:40:49.472 --> 00:40:52.112
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad
and so she got mad

574
00:40:52.113 --> 00:40:53.356
and then she tried to walk away,

575
00:40:53.357 --> 00:40:54.633
and I grabbed her glove...

576
00:40:54.634 --> 00:40:56.386
Hang on. You mean to tell me

577
00:40:56.387 --> 00:41:00.764
you got engaged to
someone you just met that day?

578
00:41:00.765 --> 00:41:02.967
Yes. Pay attention.
But the thing is...

579
00:41:02.968 --> 00:41:05.202
she wore the gloves
all the time,

580
00:41:05.203 --> 00:41:07.438
So I just thought, maybe she
has a thing about dirt.

581
00:41:07.439 --> 00:41:11.234
Didn't your parents ever
warn you about strangers?

582
00:41:11.433 --> 00:41:13.534
Yes, they did...

583
00:41:13.535 --> 00:41:15.972
But Hans is not a stranger.

584
00:41:15.973 --> 00:41:18.640
Oh yeah? What's his last name?

585
00:41:18.641 --> 00:41:20.501
Of-the-Southern-Isles?

586
00:41:20.502 --> 00:41:21.968
- What's his favorite food?
- Sandwiches.

587
00:41:21.969 --> 00:41:23.398
- Best friend's name?
- Probably John.

588
00:41:23.399 --> 00:41:24.645
- Eye color.
- Dreamy.

589
00:41:24.646 --> 00:41:26.267
- Foot size?
- Foot size doesn't matter.

590
00:41:26.268 --> 00:41:27.589
Have you had a
meal with him yet?

591
00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:28.944
What if you hate
the way he eats?

592
00:41:28.945 --> 00:41:30.686
What if you hate the
way he picks his nose?

593
00:41:30.687 --> 00:41:31.864
Picks his nose?

594
00:41:31.865 --> 00:41:32.972
And eats it.

595
00:41:32.973 --> 00:41:35.938
Excuse me, sir. He's a prince.

596
00:41:36.317 --> 00:41:37.939
All men do it.

597
00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.556
Look it doesn't
matter, it's true love.

598
00:41:41.557 --> 00:41:43.645
Doesn't sound like true love.

599
00:41:43.646 --> 00:41:45.967
Are you some sort
of love expert?

600
00:41:46.106 --> 00:41:49.008
No. But I have friends who are.

601
00:41:49.009 --> 00:41:51.205
You have friends who are
love experts?

602
00:41:51.206 --> 00:41:53.332
- I'm not buying it
- Stop talking.

603
00:41:53.333 --> 00:41:54.815
No, no, no. I'd like
to meet these...

604
00:41:54.816 --> 00:41:56.595
No, I mean it.

605
00:41:57.369 --> 00:41:58.470
Ssshhh.

606
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:12.992
Sven, go. Go!

607
00:42:14.013 --> 00:42:15.352
- What are they?
- Wolves.

608
00:42:15.353 --> 00:42:16.494
Wolves?

609
00:42:19.037 --> 00:42:20.578
- What do we do?
- I've got this.

610
00:42:20.579 --> 00:42:22.835
You just... don't
fall off and don't get eaten.

611
00:42:22.836 --> 00:42:24.341
- But I wanna help.
- No.

612
00:42:24.342 --> 00:42:25.193
Why not?

613
00:42:25.194 --> 00:42:26.078
Because I don't
trust your judgment.

614
00:42:26.079 --> 00:42:27.640
Excuse me?!

615
00:42:27.641 --> 00:42:29.221
Who marries a man she just met?

616
00:42:29.222 --> 00:42:31.248
It's true love!

617
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:35.016
Christopher!

618
00:42:35.017 --> 00:42:36.974
It's Kristoff!

619
00:42:40.838 --> 00:42:42.719
Duck!

620
00:42:46.342 --> 00:42:49.045
- You almost set me on fire!
- But I didn't.

621
00:42:55.391 --> 00:42:56.763
Get ready to jump, Sven!

622
00:42:56.764 --> 00:42:58.434
You don't tell him what to do!

623
00:42:58.875 --> 00:43:01.896
I do! Jump, Sven!

624
00:43:16.451 --> 00:43:18.934
But I just paid it off.

625
00:43:18.973 --> 00:43:23.395
Uh-oh. No, no, no.

626
00:43:23.396 --> 00:43:25.098
Grab on!

627
00:43:25.099 --> 00:43:27.401
Pull, Sven! Pull!

628
00:43:38.231 --> 00:43:41.996
I'll replace your
sled and everything in it.

629
00:43:43.397 --> 00:43:47.600
And I understand if you don't
want to help me anymore.

630
00:43:52.725 --> 00:43:54.827
Of course I don't want
to help her anymore.

631
00:43:54.828 --> 00:43:57.149
In fact, this whole
thing has ruined me

632
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:59.770
For helping anyone ever again.

633
00:43:59.992 --> 00:44:03.855
- But she'll die on her own.
- I can live with that.

634
00:44:04.095 --> 00:44:08.679
But you won't get your
new sled if she's dead.

635
00:44:08.941 --> 00:44:10.962
You know sometimes I really
don't like you.

636
00:44:10.963 --> 00:44:13.363
Hold up. We're coming.

637
00:44:13.364 --> 00:44:14.505
You are?!

638
00:44:14.506 --> 00:44:18.729
I mean, sure. I'll
let you tag along.

639
00:44:28.558 --> 00:44:32.762
- Arendelle.
- It's completely frozen.

640
00:44:34.543 --> 00:44:37.240
But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

641
00:44:37.241 --> 00:44:39.287
- Will she?
- Yeah.

642
00:44:39.288 --> 00:44:41.991
Now come on. This way to
the North Mountain?

643
00:44:43.251 --> 00:44:46.235
More like this way.

644
00:45:17.444 --> 00:45:21.608
I never knew winter
could be so beautiful.

645
00:45:22.129 --> 00:45:25.711
Yeah! It really is beautiful,
isn't it?

646
00:45:25.712 --> 00:45:27.733
But it's so white.

647
00:45:27.734 --> 00:45:29.473
You know, how about
a little color?

648
00:45:29.474 --> 00:45:33.013
I'm thinking like maybe some
crimson, chartreuse...

649
00:45:33.014 --> 00:45:35.793
How about yellow... no,
not yellow.

650
00:45:35.794 --> 00:45:38.803
Yellow and snow? Brrrr... no go.

651
00:45:42.088 --> 00:45:44.008
Am I right?

652
00:45:44.009 --> 00:45:45.690
- Hi!
- You're creepy.

653
00:45:45.711 --> 00:45:47.491
- I don't want it!
- Backatchya!

654
00:45:47.492 --> 00:45:49.053
- Please don't drop me.
- Come on, it's just a head.

655
00:45:49.054 --> 00:45:50.045
Don't!

656
00:45:50.046 --> 00:45:51.069
All right, we got
off to a bad start.

657
00:45:51.070 --> 00:45:53.337
Ew, ew, the body!

658
00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.609
Wait, what am I looking
at right now?

659
00:45:57.610 --> 00:45:59.784
Why are you hanging off
the earth like a bat?

660
00:46:00.464 --> 00:46:02.866
Alright. Wait one second.

661
00:46:03.848 --> 00:46:06.444
- Oooh! Thank you!
- You're welcome.

662
00:46:06.445 --> 00:46:08.767
Now I'm perfect.

663
00:46:08.768 --> 00:46:10.192
Well, almost.

664
00:46:10.193 --> 00:46:12.495
It was like my whole
life got upside down.

665
00:46:13.276 --> 00:46:14.808
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry!
I was just...

666
00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:16.373
- Woo! Head rush!
- Are you okay?

667
00:46:16.374 --> 00:46:19.837
Are you kidding me?
I am wonderful!

668
00:46:19.838 --> 00:46:21.562
I've always wanted a nose.

669
00:46:21.563 --> 00:46:24.842
So cute. It's like a
little baby unicorn.

670
00:46:24.843 --> 00:46:26.969
What? Hey! Whoa.

671
00:46:26.970 --> 00:46:29.431
Oh, I love it even more! Hah...

672
00:46:29.912 --> 00:46:32.193
All right, let's start
this thing over.

673
00:46:32.194 --> 00:46:37.059
Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I
like warm hugs.

674
00:46:37.199 --> 00:46:38.700
Olaf?

675
00:46:41.222 --> 00:46:43.905
That's right, Olaf.

676
00:46:44.346 --> 00:46:47.648
And you are?

677
00:46:47.909 --> 00:46:49.248
Oh, um... I'm Anna.

678
00:46:49.249 --> 00:46:51.607
And who's the funky-looking
donkey over there?

679
00:46:51.608 --> 00:46:53.272
That's Sven.

680
00:46:53.273 --> 00:46:55.154
Uh-huh. And who's
the reindeer?

681
00:46:55.155 --> 00:46:56.415
Sven.

682
00:46:56.416 --> 00:46:59.379
Oh. They're... oh, okay...
Makes things easier for me.

683
00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:01.813
Ha. Aw, look at him
tryin' to kiss my nose.

684
00:47:01.814 --> 00:47:03.318
I like you, too!

685
00:47:03.319 --> 00:47:05.579
Olaf, did Elsa build you?

686
00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:06.765
Yeah. Why?

687
00:47:06.766 --> 00:47:08.868
- You know where she is?
- Yeah. Why?

688
00:47:08.869 --> 00:47:10.509
Do you think you could
show us the way?

689
00:47:10.510 --> 00:47:12.891
- Yeah. Why?
- How does this work?

690
00:47:13.073 --> 00:47:15.413
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus
here.

691
00:47:15.414 --> 00:47:17.876
- Yeah, Why?
- I'll tell you Why.

692
00:47:17.877 --> 00:47:19.898
We need Elsa to
Bring back summer.

693
00:47:19.899 --> 00:47:21.640
- Summer?
- Uhum.

694
00:47:21.641 --> 00:47:23.295
Oh, I don't know why but

695
00:47:23.296 --> 00:47:26.685
I've always loved the idea of summer,

696
00:47:26.686 --> 00:47:30.183
And Sun, and all things hot.

697
00:47:30.184 --> 00:47:31.348
Really?

698
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:33.651
I'm guessing you don't have
much experience with heat.

699
00:47:33.852 --> 00:47:35.232
Nope!

700
00:47:35.233 --> 00:47:38.096
But sometimes I like
to close my eyes

701
00:47:38.097 --> 00:47:41.898
and imagine what it'd be
like when summer does come.

702
00:47:44.722 --> 00:47:48.965
Bees'll buzz, Kids'll blow
dandelion fuzz

703
00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:54.111
And i'll be doing
whatever snow does in summer.

704
00:47:55.613 --> 00:48:00.215
A drink in my hand, my snow up
against the burning sand.

705
00:48:00.216 --> 00:48:04.581
Probably getting gorgeously
tanned in summer.

706
00:48:04.761 --> 00:48:06.693
I'll finally see
a summer breeze,

707
00:48:06.694 --> 00:48:08.925
blow away a winter storm

708
00:48:09.245 --> 00:48:10.677
and find out what happens to

709
00:48:10.678 --> 00:48:14.410
solid water, When it gets warm.

710
00:48:15.772 --> 00:48:20.235
And I can't wait to see, what
my buddies all think of me.

711
00:48:20.295 --> 00:48:25.200
Just imagine how much
cooler i'll be in summer!

712
00:48:29.844 --> 00:48:31.764
The hot and the cold
are both so intense,

713
00:48:31.765 --> 00:48:34.649
Put ‘em together, It
just makes sense!

714
00:48:38.472 --> 00:48:40.494
Winter's a good time
to stay in and cuddle,

715
00:48:40.495 --> 00:48:42.816
But put me in summer
and i'll be a...

716
00:48:43.857 --> 00:48:45.597
Happy Snowman!

717
00:48:45.598 --> 00:48:49.523
When life gets rough I like
to hold on to my dream

718
00:48:49.542 --> 00:48:54.567
of relaxing in the summer
sun just letting off steam!

719
00:48:56.009 --> 00:48:59.611
Oh the sky will be Blue...

720
00:48:59.612 --> 00:49:03.254
And you guys'll be there too.

721
00:49:03.255 --> 00:49:08.920
When I finally do what frozen
things do in summer!

722
00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:11.303
- I'm gonna tell him.
- Don't you dare.

723
00:49:11.964 --> 00:49:17.849
In summer!

724
00:49:19.191 --> 00:49:21.997
So, Come on! Elsa's this way.

725
00:49:21.998 --> 00:49:24.770
Let's go bring back summer!

726
00:49:24.771 --> 00:49:26.617
I'm coming!

727
00:49:27.679 --> 00:49:29.660
Somebody's got to tell him.

728
00:49:34.585 --> 00:49:36.982
No. No. You've got the
bark facing down.

729
00:49:36.983 --> 00:49:39.049
The bark needs to be face-up.

730
00:49:39.089 --> 00:49:40.635
Bark down is drier.

731
00:49:40.636 --> 00:49:42.111
- Bark up.
- Bark down.

732
00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:44.134
Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

733
00:49:44.135 --> 00:49:47.211
Arendelle is indebted
to you, Your Highness.

734
00:49:47.212 --> 00:49:49.529
The castle is open. There's soup

735
00:49:49.530 --> 00:49:51.815
and hot glogg in the Great Hall.

736
00:49:51.816 --> 00:49:53.122
Here. Pass these out.

737
00:49:53.123 --> 00:49:54.825
Prince Hans, are we just

738
00:49:54.826 --> 00:49:56.559
expected to sit here and freeze

739
00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:59.928
while you give away all of
Arendelle's tradable goods?

740
00:49:59.929 --> 00:50:01.533
Princess Anna has
given her orders and...

741
00:50:01.534 --> 00:50:03.171
And that's another thing!

742
00:50:03.172 --> 00:50:05.074
Has it dawned on you
that your princess

743
00:50:05.075 --> 00:50:07.009
may be conspiring with
a wicked sorceress...

744
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:08.195
to destroy us all?

745
00:50:08.196 --> 00:50:11.720
Do not question the Princess.
She left me in charge,

746
00:50:11.721 --> 00:50:14.983
and I will not hesitate to protect
Arendelle from treason.

747
00:50:15.303 --> 00:50:17.244
Treason?!

748
00:50:22.269 --> 00:50:25.177
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy.
Easy. Easy.

749
00:50:27.134 --> 00:50:30.597
Princess Anna's horse. What
happened to her? Where is she?

750
00:50:31.138 --> 00:50:33.339
Princess Anna is in trouble.

751
00:50:33.340 --> 00:50:36.196
I need volunteers to go
with me to find her!

752
00:50:36.197 --> 00:50:39.725
I volunteer two men, my Lord!

753
00:50:39.726 --> 00:50:41.586
Be prepared for anything,

754
00:50:41.587 --> 00:50:44.229
And should you
encounter the Queen,

755
00:50:44.330 --> 00:50:47.467
You are to put an
end to this winter.

756
00:50:47.468 --> 00:50:49.715
Do you understand?

757
00:50:53.238 --> 00:50:56.601
So how exactly are you
planning to stop this weather?

758
00:50:56.602 --> 00:50:59.243
Oh, I am gonna
talk to my sister.

759
00:50:59.244 --> 00:51:01.296
That's your plan?
My ice business is

760
00:51:01.297 --> 00:51:03.381
riding on you talking
to your sister.

761
00:51:03.382 --> 00:51:05.089
Yup.

762
00:51:05.090 --> 00:51:07.066
So you're not at
all afraid of her?

763
00:51:07.067 --> 00:51:08.912
- Why would I be?
- Yeah.

764
00:51:08.913 --> 00:51:12.010
I bet Elsa's the nicest,
gentlest,

765
00:51:12.011 --> 00:51:14.038
Warmest person ever.

766
00:51:14.039 --> 00:51:15.735
Oh, look at that.

767
00:51:15.736 --> 00:51:17.661
I've been impaled.

768
00:51:22.205 --> 00:51:24.148
What now?

769
00:51:26.730 --> 00:51:28.481
It's too steep. I've
only got one rope,

770
00:51:28.482 --> 00:51:30.311
And you don't know how
to climb mountains.

771
00:51:30.312 --> 00:51:32.355
Says who?

772
00:51:33.356 --> 00:51:34.677
What are you doing?

773
00:51:34.678 --> 00:51:38.821
I'm going to see my sister.

774
00:51:38.822 --> 00:51:42.820
You're going to kill yourself.
I wouldn't put my foot there.

775
00:51:42.821 --> 00:51:44.667
- You're distracting me.
- Or there.

776
00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:46.848
How do you know Elsa even
wants to see you?

777
00:51:46.849 --> 00:51:48.559
I'm just blocking you out cause

778
00:51:48.560 --> 00:51:50.892
I gotta concentrate here.

779
00:51:51.413 --> 00:51:53.032
You know, most
people who disappear

780
00:51:53.033 --> 00:51:54.711
into the mountains
want to be alone.

781
00:51:54.712 --> 00:51:58.290
Nobody wants to be alone.
Except maybe you...

782
00:51:58.291 --> 00:52:02.104
I'm not alone...
I have friends, remember?

783
00:52:02.303 --> 00:52:04.519
You mean the love experts?

784
00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.967
Yes, the love experts!

785
00:52:09.270 --> 00:52:11.451
Please tell me I'm almost there.

786
00:52:12.133 --> 00:52:14.874
Does the air seem a bit
thin to you up here?

787
00:52:15.996 --> 00:52:18.357
- Hang on.
- Hey, Sven?

788
00:52:18.358 --> 00:52:20.937
Not sure if this is going to
solve the problem, but I found

789
00:52:20.938 --> 00:52:23.382
a staircase that leads exactly
where you want it to go.

790
00:52:23.383 --> 00:52:26.846
Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

791
00:52:27.007 --> 00:52:30.709
Thanks! That was like a
crazy trust exercise.

792
00:52:44.824 --> 00:52:48.331
Now that's ice. I might cry.

793
00:52:48.332 --> 00:52:52.069
Go ahead. I won't judge.

794
00:52:58.936 --> 00:53:02.620
All right, take it easy.
Come here, I gotcha.

795
00:53:02.721 --> 00:53:05.562
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

796
00:53:06.964 --> 00:53:08.805
Flawless.

797
00:53:13.449 --> 00:53:16.532
Knock... Just knock...

798
00:53:17.954 --> 00:53:20.016
Why isn't she knocking...?

799
00:53:20.437 --> 00:53:23.219
Do you think she
knows how to knock?

800
00:53:27.443 --> 00:53:30.806
It opened. That's a first.

801
00:53:31.708 --> 00:53:33.507
You should probably
wait out here.

802
00:53:33.508 --> 00:53:34.066
What?

803
00:53:34.067 --> 00:53:36.010
Last time I introduced her to
a guy, she froze everything.

804
00:53:36.011 --> 00:53:40.655
But. But... Oh come on,
It's a palace made of ice.

805
00:53:40.656 --> 00:53:42.892
- Ice is my life.
- Bye, Sven.

806
00:53:42.893 --> 00:53:44.859
You too, Olaf.

807
00:53:44.860 --> 00:53:47.136
- Me?
- Just give us a minute.

808
00:53:47.137 --> 00:53:48.823
Okay.

809
00:53:49.503 --> 00:53:54.187
One... two... Three... four...

810
00:54:05.279 --> 00:54:09.943
Elsa? It's me... Anna.

811
00:54:13.365 --> 00:54:15.008
Anna?

812
00:54:18.550 --> 00:54:22.373
Wow...
Elsa, you look different...

813
00:54:22.374 --> 00:54:25.892
It's a good different...
And this place

814
00:54:25.893 --> 00:54:28.600
- Is amazing.
- Thank you.

815
00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.402
I never knew what
I was capable of.

816
00:54:31.703 --> 00:54:34.439
I'm so sorry about what
happened. If I'd known...

817
00:54:34.440 --> 00:54:36.167
No, it's okay.

818
00:54:36.507 --> 00:54:38.649
You don't have to apologize

819
00:54:38.650 --> 00:54:41.693
But you should
probably go, please.

820
00:54:41.833 --> 00:54:43.769
But I just got here.

821
00:54:43.770 --> 00:54:45.696
You belong in Arendelle.

822
00:54:45.697 --> 00:54:49.279
- So do you.
- No, Anna. I belong here.

823
00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:51.501
Alone.

824
00:54:51.502 --> 00:54:54.004
Where I can be who I am,

825
00:54:54.144 --> 00:54:55.900
Without hurting anybody.

826
00:54:55.901 --> 00:54:58.728
- Actually, about that...
- 58...59...60.

827
00:54:58.969 --> 00:55:00.850
Wait. What is that?

828
00:55:00.851 --> 00:55:04.032
Hi, I'm Olaf and I
like warm hugs.

829
00:55:04.033 --> 00:55:06.034
Olaf?

830
00:55:06.035 --> 00:55:09.159
You Built me. You remember that?

831
00:55:09.358 --> 00:55:11.280
And You're alive?

832
00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.742
Um... I think so?

833
00:55:15.063 --> 00:55:17.766
He's just like the one
we built as kids.

834
00:55:18.648 --> 00:55:20.268
Yeah!

835
00:55:20.269 --> 00:55:22.630
So we were so close.

836
00:55:22.631 --> 00:55:24.912
We can be like that again.

837
00:55:26.014 --> 00:55:28.676
Slow Down...

838
00:55:30.839 --> 00:55:32.879
Anna!

839
00:55:35.223 --> 00:55:37.524
No, We can't.

840
00:55:37.525 --> 00:55:39.171
- Goodbye, Anna.
- Elsa, wait...

841
00:55:39.172 --> 00:55:41.688
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

842
00:55:41.689 --> 00:55:44.650
You don't have to protect me.
I'm not afraid.

843
00:55:45.133 --> 00:55:47.368
Please don't shut me out again.

844
00:55:47.369 --> 00:55:49.335
Please don't slam the door.

845
00:55:49.336 --> 00:55:53.518
You don't have to keep your
distance anymore.

846
00:55:53.519 --> 00:55:56.562
Cause for the first time in
forever,

847
00:55:56.563 --> 00:55:58.744
I finally understand.

848
00:55:58.745 --> 00:56:03.183
For the first time in forever,
We can fix this hand in hand.

849
00:56:03.184 --> 00:56:05.465
We can head down
this mountain Together.

850
00:56:05.466 --> 00:56:08.493
You don't have to live in fear.

851
00:56:08.494 --> 00:56:12.557
‘Cause for the first time in forever,

852
00:56:12.558 --> 00:56:15.960
I will be right here.

853
00:56:15.961 --> 00:56:18.897
Anna, Please go back home.

854
00:56:18.898 --> 00:56:21.246
Your life awaits.

855
00:56:21.526 --> 00:56:25.143
Go enjoy the sun
And open up the gates.

856
00:56:25.144 --> 00:56:28.727
- Yeah, But...
- I know! You mean well,

857
00:56:28.728 --> 00:56:31.174
But leave me be.

858
00:56:31.175 --> 00:56:35.247
Yes, I'm alone But
I'm alone and Free.

859
00:56:35.248 --> 00:56:40.604
Just stay away and
you'll be safe from me.

860
00:56:41.285 --> 00:56:43.256
- Actually, We're not.
- What do you mean You're not?

861
00:56:43.257 --> 00:56:44.906
I get the feeling
you don't know?

862
00:56:44.907 --> 00:56:46.758
What do I not know?

863
00:56:46.759 --> 00:56:52.215
Arendelle's in deep
deep deep deep snow.

864
00:56:53.065 --> 00:56:54.095
What?

865
00:56:54.096 --> 00:56:58.174
You kind of set off an eternal
winter... everywhere.

866
00:56:58.175 --> 00:56:59.600
Everywhere?

867
00:56:59.601 --> 00:57:00.763
It's okay, you can
just unfreeze it.

868
00:57:00.764 --> 00:57:01.958
No, I can't.

869
00:57:01.959 --> 00:57:04.721
- I don't know how.
- Sure you can.

870
00:57:04.722 --> 00:57:06.107
I know you can!

871
00:57:06.108 --> 00:57:10.246
‘Cause for the first time in forever,

872
00:57:10.247 --> 00:57:12.984
I'm such a Fool!
I can't be Free!

873
00:57:12.985 --> 00:57:15.316
You don't have to be afraid.

874
00:57:15.317 --> 00:57:17.821
No escape
From the storm inside of me!

875
00:57:17.822 --> 00:57:20.000
We can work this out together.

876
00:57:20.001 --> 00:57:21.894
I can't control the curse!

877
00:57:21.895 --> 00:57:25.697
We'll reverse the storm
you've made.

878
00:57:25.698 --> 00:57:28.300
Anna, Please, You'll
only make it worse!

879
00:57:28.301 --> 00:57:29.201
Don't panic.

880
00:57:29.202 --> 00:57:30.502
There's so much fear!

881
00:57:30.503 --> 00:57:32.303
We'll make the sun shine bright.

882
00:57:32.304 --> 00:57:33.305
You're not safe here!

883
00:57:33.306 --> 00:57:35.507
We can face this
thing together...

884
00:57:41.400 --> 00:57:45.103
I can't!

885
00:57:52.111 --> 00:57:55.093
Anna. Are you okay?

886
00:57:55.214 --> 00:57:58.956
- I'm okay... I'm fine.
- Who's this?

887
00:57:58.957 --> 00:58:02.034
Wait, it doesn't matter.
Just... You have to go.

888
00:58:02.035 --> 00:58:05.042
No, I know we can figure
this out together...

889
00:58:05.043 --> 00:58:08.605
How? What power do you
have to stop this winter?

890
00:58:08.606 --> 00:58:09.748
To stop me?

891
00:58:09.749 --> 00:58:11.099
Anna, I think we should go.

892
00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:13.549
No. I'm not leaving
without you, Elsa.

893
00:58:13.550 --> 00:58:16.113
Yes, you are.

894
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.957
Stop. Put us down!

895
00:58:25.958 --> 00:58:27.759
Go away!

896
00:58:30.947 --> 00:58:32.808
Heads up!

897
00:58:33.129 --> 00:58:35.650
Watch out for my butt!

898
00:58:36.072 --> 00:58:39.070
It is not nice to throw people!

899
00:58:39.071 --> 00:58:40.815
Wow, Wow, Wow Feisty pants.
Ok, Relax.

900
00:58:40.816 --> 00:58:42.557
Just Calm down. Calm down.

901
00:58:42.558 --> 00:58:43.478
All Right. I'm Okay.

902
00:58:43.479 --> 00:58:44.677
Just let the snow man be.

903
00:58:44.678 --> 00:58:46.478
- I'm Calm...
- Great.

904
00:58:46.482 --> 00:58:47.980
Oh... Come on!

905
00:58:52.506 --> 00:58:53.548
Uh-oh. See. Now
you made him mad!

906
00:58:53.549 --> 00:58:54.624
I'll distract him.

907
00:58:54.625 --> 00:58:56.590
You guys go.

908
00:58:56.591 --> 00:58:59.214
No, no, not you guys.

909
00:58:59.715 --> 00:59:01.755
This just got a
whole lot harder.

910
00:59:19.612 --> 00:59:21.554
What are you doing?

911
00:59:24.698 --> 00:59:26.419
I got him!

912
00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.661
It's a hundred foot drop.

913
00:59:29.662 --> 00:59:31.364
It's two hundred.

914
00:59:33.006 --> 00:59:34.981
- What's that for?
- I'm digging a snow anchor.

915
00:59:34.982 --> 00:59:37.288
Okay. What if we fall?

916
00:59:37.289 --> 00:59:39.201
There's twenty feet
of fresh powder down there

917
00:59:39.202 --> 00:59:41.147
It'll be like
landing on a pillow...

918
00:59:41.148 --> 00:59:43.115
Hopefully.

919
00:59:45.276 --> 00:59:47.097
Okay, Anna. On three.

920
00:59:47.098 --> 00:59:49.254
- One...
- Okay. You tell me when...

921
00:59:49.255 --> 00:59:51.377
- Two...
- I'm ready to go...I was born ready! Yes!

922
00:59:51.378 --> 00:59:53.144
Calm down.

923
00:59:55.186 --> 00:59:56.585
Tree!

924
00:59:56.586 --> 01:00:01.953
What the...
Whoa! That happened.

925
01:00:03.134 --> 01:00:05.936
Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.

926
01:00:09.539 --> 01:00:12.360
There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!

927
01:00:12.361 --> 01:00:15.767
Where'd ya guys go? We totally
lost Marshmallow back there!

928
01:00:16.448 --> 01:00:19.171
Hey. We were just
talking about you.

929
01:00:19.204 --> 01:00:21.645
Ll good things, all good things.

930
01:00:21.646 --> 01:00:23.292
No!

931
01:00:25.855 --> 01:00:29.258
This is not making much of a
difference! Is it?

932
01:00:30.419 --> 01:00:32.040
Olaf!

933
01:00:32.221 --> 01:00:35.803
- Hang in there, guys!
- Go Faster!

934
01:00:36.045 --> 01:00:38.207
Wait, what?

935
01:00:44.272 --> 01:00:45.913
Kristoff!

936
01:00:47.434 --> 01:00:50.131
Don't come back!

937
01:00:50.132 --> 01:00:52.180
We won't.

938
01:00:59.206 --> 01:01:02.209
Hey, you were right.
Just like a pillow.

939
01:01:02.715 --> 01:01:04.216
Olaf!

940
01:01:04.291 --> 01:01:07.653
I can't feel my legs!
I can't feel my legs!

941
01:01:08.594 --> 01:01:10.215
Those are my legs.

942
01:01:10.216 --> 01:01:12.418
Ooh. Hey, do me a favor,
grab my butt.

943
01:01:12.598 --> 01:01:14.558
Oh, That feels better.

944
01:01:14.559 --> 01:01:16.962
Hey, Sven! He found us.

945
01:01:16.963 --> 01:01:19.049
Who's my cute little reindeer?

946
01:01:19.050 --> 01:01:21.367
Don't talk to him like that.

947
01:01:23.909 --> 01:01:25.750
Here.

948
01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:28.774
- You okay?
- Thank you.

949
01:01:30.115 --> 01:01:32.037
Um... How's your head?

950
01:01:33.018 --> 01:01:34.479
I mean, It's fine.
Ah... I'm good.

951
01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.974
Ha. I've got a thick skull.

952
01:01:35.975 --> 01:01:39.964
I don't have a skull...
Or bones.

953
01:01:39.965 --> 01:01:41.805
So...

954
01:01:41.806 --> 01:01:44.508
- So Now what?
- Now what?

955
01:01:44.709 --> 01:01:46.329
Now what?!

956
01:01:46.330 --> 01:01:49.391
Oooh! What am I gonna do?

957
01:01:49.392 --> 01:01:51.379
She threw me out.
I can't go back to

958
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.400
Arendelle with the
weather like this.

959
01:01:53.401 --> 01:01:54.370
And then there's
your ice business...

960
01:01:54.371 --> 01:01:57.221
Hey, hey, don't worry
about my ice business...

961
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.601
- Worry about your hair?!
- What?

962
01:01:59.602 --> 01:02:01.573
Just fell off a cliff. You
should see your hair.

963
01:02:01.574 --> 01:02:06.148
- No, yours is turning white.
- White? It's... what?

964
01:02:06.149 --> 01:02:08.770
It's because she
struck you, isn't it?

965
01:02:08.771 --> 01:02:10.912
Does it look bad?

966
01:02:11.533 --> 01:02:12.994
- No.
- You hesitated.

967
01:02:12.995 --> 01:02:16.412
No, I didn't. Anna,
you need help. Okay? Come on.

968
01:02:16.413 --> 01:02:19.795
- Okay! Where are we going?
- To see my friends.

969
01:02:19.796 --> 01:02:22.645
- The love experts?
- Love experts?!

970
01:02:22.646 --> 01:02:25.081
And don't worry, they'll
be able to fix this.

971
01:02:25.082 --> 01:02:27.348
How do you know?

972
01:02:27.588 --> 01:02:30.011
Because I've seen
them do it before.

973
01:02:30.611 --> 01:02:33.834
I like to consider
myself a love expert.

974
01:02:37.778 --> 01:02:41.422
Get it together. Control it.

975
01:02:41.561 --> 01:02:45.419
Don't feel. Don't feel.

976
01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:47.806
Don't feel!

977
01:03:01.841 --> 01:03:04.924
Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

978
01:03:07.426 --> 01:03:10.229
- Are you cold?
- A little.

979
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:14.692
Wait. Come here.

980
01:03:18.256 --> 01:03:21.579
So, about my friends...

981
01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:25.143
Well, I say friends, they're
more like family...

982
01:03:25.282 --> 01:03:27.735
Anyway, when I was
a kid, it was just me and Sven

983
01:03:27.736 --> 01:03:30.487
until you know, they took us in.

984
01:03:30.729 --> 01:03:32.588
- They did?
- Yeah.

985
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:34.371
I don't want to
scare you, they can be

986
01:03:34.372 --> 01:03:36.187
a little bit inappropriate...

987
01:03:36.188 --> 01:03:39.594
And loud... very loud...

988
01:03:39.595 --> 01:03:41.989
They're also stubborn
at times, And a little

989
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:46.222
Overbearing. And heavy.
Really, really heavy. Which you...

990
01:03:46.223 --> 01:03:48.238
But You know, you okay.
They're fine. They mean well.

991
01:03:48.239 --> 01:03:50.967
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

992
01:03:52.288 --> 01:03:54.885
Okay then...

993
01:03:54.886 --> 01:03:57.446
Meet my family.

994
01:03:57.447 --> 01:03:59.105
Hey, guys!

995
01:03:59.106 --> 01:04:00.996
They're rocks.

996
01:04:02.598 --> 01:04:06.721
He's crazy.

997
01:04:08.905 --> 01:04:11.803
Hey, Wow... I pretty Recognize
you, What's so much Weigh?

998
01:04:11.927 --> 01:04:14.928
I'll distract them
while you run.

999
01:04:14.929 --> 01:04:19.693
Hi, Sven's family!
It's nice to meet you!

1000
01:04:19.694 --> 01:04:22.430
Anna, because I love
you, I insist you run.

1001
01:04:22.431 --> 01:04:26.519
Understand you're love experts!

1002
01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:29.063
Why aren't you running?

1003
01:04:29.664 --> 01:04:32.179
Okay. Um... I'm gonna go...

1004
01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:34.929
No, no, no. Anna, wait!

1005
01:04:36.469 --> 01:04:38.551
Kristoff!

1006
01:04:42.916 --> 01:04:44.777
Kristoff's home!

1007
01:04:44.778 --> 01:04:46.840
Kristoff! Kristoff's home!
It's been too long!

1008
01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:48.936
Kristoff's home!

1009
01:04:48.937 --> 01:04:50.842
Wait? Kristoff?

1010
01:04:50.843 --> 01:04:52.744
- Yeah.
- Oh, lemme look at you!

1011
01:04:52.745 --> 01:04:54.485
Oh, take off your clothes,
Kristoff, I wash them.

1012
01:04:54.486 --> 01:04:56.108
Ah! No. I'm gonna keep
my clothes on, Look.

1013
01:04:56.109 --> 01:04:57.764
Great to see you all.

1014
01:04:57.765 --> 01:05:00.066
- But where's grand Pabbie?
- He's napping.

1015
01:05:00.067 --> 01:05:01.815
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1016
01:05:01.816 --> 01:05:03.528
And I earned my fire crystal.

1017
01:05:03.529 --> 01:05:05.011
I passed a kidney stone.

1018
01:05:05.012 --> 01:05:06.417
Kristoff, Pick me up.

1019
01:05:06.418 --> 01:05:09.074
You're getting big...
Good for you.

1020
01:05:09.075 --> 01:05:11.862
Trolls? They're trolls.

1021
01:05:14.105 --> 01:05:19.191
- He's brought a girl!
- He's brought a girl!

1022
01:05:21.752 --> 01:05:22.893
What's going on?

1023
01:05:22.894 --> 01:05:24.293
I've learned to
just roll with it.

1024
01:05:24.294 --> 01:05:27.822
Let me see. Bright eyes.
Working nose. Strong teeth.

1025
01:05:27.823 --> 01:05:31.279
Yes, yes, yes. She'll do
nicely for our Kristoff.

1026
01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:32.152
Wait. Oh. Um. No.

1027
01:05:32.153 --> 01:05:34.787
You've got the wrong idea.
That's not why I brought her here.

1028
01:05:34.788 --> 01:05:37.097
Right. We're not. I'm not...

1029
01:05:37.098 --> 01:05:39.067
What's the issue, dear?

1030
01:05:39.068 --> 01:05:42.205
Why are you
holding back from such a man?

1031
01:05:42.206 --> 01:05:43.308
Is it the clumpy way he walks?

1032
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:44.444
What?

1033
01:05:44.445 --> 01:05:46.614
- Or the Grumpy way he talks?
- No.

1034
01:05:46.615 --> 01:05:48.307
Or the pear-shaped,
square-shaped

1035
01:05:48.308 --> 01:05:50.298
weirdness of his feet? - Hey!

1036
01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.252
And though we know
he washes well

1037
01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:55.618
he always ends up sorta smelly.

1038
01:05:55.619 --> 01:05:59.606
But you'll never meet a fella
who's as sensitive and sweet.

1039
01:05:59.607 --> 01:06:00.347
That's nice.

1040
01:06:00.348 --> 01:06:02.373
So he's a bit of a fixer upper.

1041
01:06:02.374 --> 01:06:04.431
So he's got a few flaws.

1042
01:06:04.432 --> 01:06:07.102
- Like his peculiar brain, dear.
- His thing for the reindeer.

1043
01:06:07.103 --> 01:06:09.110
- That outside a few of nature's laws.
- This is not about me!

1044
01:06:09.111 --> 01:06:11.299
So he's a bit of a fixer upper,

1045
01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.521
But this we're certain of...

1046
01:06:13.522 --> 01:06:18.165
You can fix this fixer upper
up with a little bit of love.

1047
01:06:18.205 --> 01:06:20.377
Can we just stop
talking about this?!

1048
01:06:20.378 --> 01:06:22.582
We've got a real,
actual problem here.

1049
01:06:22.583 --> 01:06:27.308
I'll say... So tell me dear,
Is it the way that he runs scared?

1050
01:06:27.309 --> 01:06:29.594
Or that he's socially impaired?

1051
01:06:29.595 --> 01:06:32.752
Or that he only likes
to tinkle in the Woods?

1052
01:06:32.753 --> 01:06:33.878
I do not need to know that.

1053
01:06:33.879 --> 01:06:36.322
Are you holding
back your fondness

1054
01:06:36.323 --> 01:06:38.799
Due to his unmanly blondness?

1055
01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.846
Or the way he covers up
that he's the honest goods?

1056
01:06:43.508 --> 01:06:45.200
He's just a bit of a fixer upper.

1057
01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:46.892
He's got a couple a' bugs.

1058
01:06:46.893 --> 01:06:47.992
No, I don't.

1059
01:06:47.993 --> 01:06:50.075
His isolation is confirmation of

1060
01:06:50.076 --> 01:06:52.456
his desperation
for healing hugs.

1061
01:06:52.556 --> 01:06:57.160
So he's a bit of a fixer
upper, But we know what to do.

1062
01:06:57.161 --> 01:06:59.033
The way to fix up this fixer

1063
01:06:59.034 --> 01:07:01.205
upper is to fix him up with you.

1064
01:07:02.566 --> 01:07:04.447
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Enough!

1065
01:07:04.448 --> 01:07:07.630
She's engaged to someone
else. Okay?!

1066
01:07:10.654 --> 01:07:13.230
So she's a bit of a fixer upper,

1067
01:07:13.231 --> 01:07:14.937
That's a minor thing.

1068
01:07:14.938 --> 01:07:17.413
This quote “engagement”
Is a flex arrangement.

1069
01:07:17.414 --> 01:07:20.124
And by the way,
I don't see no Ring.

1070
01:07:20.125 --> 01:07:22.127
So she's a bit of a fixer upper,

1071
01:07:22.128 --> 01:07:24.130
Her brain's a bit betwixt.

1072
01:07:24.131 --> 01:07:26.366
Get the fiance out
of the way And

1073
01:07:26.367 --> 01:07:28.900
the whole thing will be fixed!

1074
01:07:30.713 --> 01:07:32.689
We aren't saying
you can change him

1075
01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:35.076
'Cause people don't
really change.

1076
01:07:35.537 --> 01:07:37.770
We're only saying that love's a force

1077
01:07:37.771 --> 01:07:40.302
That's powerful and strange.

1078
01:07:40.321 --> 01:07:42.714
People make bad
choices if they're

1079
01:07:42.715 --> 01:07:45.140
mad or scared or stressed.

1080
01:07:45.141 --> 01:07:47.568
But throw a little
love their way...

1081
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:50.030
throw a little love their way.

1082
01:07:50.031 --> 01:07:52.253
And you'll bring out their best!

1083
01:07:52.254 --> 01:07:54.509
True love brings out the best!

1084
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:57.029
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper,

1085
01:07:57.030 --> 01:07:59.220
that's what it's all about.

1086
01:07:59.399 --> 01:08:02.018
Father, sister, brother! 
We need each other

1087
01:08:02.019 --> 01:08:04.736
to raise us up and round us out.

1088
01:08:04.737 --> 01:08:07.439
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper,

1089
01:08:07.440 --> 01:08:10.341
But when push comes to shove.

1090
01:08:10.342 --> 01:08:12.634
The only fixer upper fixer
that can fix a fixer upper is

1091
01:08:12.635 --> 01:08:17.959
True, True, True, True, Love

1092
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:22.860
Love, Love, Love, True Love...
True-e-e-e-e-e.

1093
01:08:22.861 --> 01:08:26.819
Do you, Anna, take Kristoff to
be your trollfully wedded...

1094
01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:28.006
Wait, what?!

1095
01:08:28.007 --> 01:08:30.048
You're getting married.

1096
01:08:32.190 --> 01:08:34.192
She's as cold as ice.

1097
01:08:36.214 --> 01:08:38.549
There's strange magic here!

1098
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:41.118
- Grand Pabbie!
- Bring her to me.

1099
01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:46.042
Anna, your life is in danger.

1100
01:08:46.043 --> 01:08:49.706
There is ice in your heart,
put there by your sister.

1101
01:08:49.707 --> 01:08:54.731
If not removed, to solid ice
will you freeze, forever.

1102
01:08:54.732 --> 01:08:56.331
What ...? No.

1103
01:08:56.332 --> 01:08:58.004
But you can remove it, Right?

1104
01:08:58.005 --> 01:08:59.710
I can not, I'm sorry Kristoff...

1105
01:08:59.711 --> 01:09:03.981
If it was her head
that would be easy.

1106
01:09:03.982 --> 01:09:08.484
But only an act of true love
can thaw a frozen heart.

1107
01:09:08.924 --> 01:09:10.565
An act of true love?

1108
01:09:10.566 --> 01:09:13.688
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1109
01:09:19.274 --> 01:09:21.791
Anna, we've got to get
you back to Hans.

1110
01:09:21.792 --> 01:09:22.917
Hans.

1111
01:09:22.918 --> 01:09:24.839
Pull us out, Sven.

1112
01:09:27.082 --> 01:09:30.483
- Olaf! Come on.
- I'm coming!

1113
01:09:30.484 --> 01:09:34.989
Let's go kiss Hans!
Who is this Hans?!

1114
01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:46.289
We are here to find
Princess Anna.

1115
01:09:46.290 --> 01:09:48.215
Be on guard,

1116
01:09:48.216 --> 01:09:51.184
but no harm is to come
to the Queen.

1117
01:09:51.725 --> 01:09:54.166
- Do you understand?
- Yes, sir.

1118
01:10:15.907 --> 01:10:17.989
The Queen.

1119
01:10:32.402 --> 01:10:35.004
Up there!
Come on!

1120
01:10:38.408 --> 01:10:40.630
No, Please.

1121
01:10:46.415 --> 01:10:48.497
Stay away!

1122
01:10:49.699 --> 01:10:51.500
Fire! Fire

1123
01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:53.983
Get her! Get her!

1124
01:11:49.415 --> 01:11:51.155
Queen Elsa!

1125
01:11:51.156 --> 01:11:54.160
Don't be the monster
they fear you are.

1126
01:12:41.443 --> 01:12:44.486
No...What have I done?

1127
01:12:50.732 --> 01:12:52.432
Why did you bring me here?

1128
01:12:52.433 --> 01:12:54.494
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1129
01:12:54.495 --> 01:12:58.093
But I'm a danger to Arendelle.
Get Anna.

1130
01:12:58.094 --> 01:13:00.761
Anna has not returned...

1131
01:13:01.643 --> 01:13:04.255
If you would just stop the winter,

1132
01:13:04.256 --> 01:13:07.168
bring back summer... please.

1133
01:13:07.709 --> 01:13:11.371
Don't you see... I can't.

1134
01:13:14.515 --> 01:13:17.857
You have to tell them to let me go.

1135
01:13:18.739 --> 01:13:21.220
I will do what I can.

1136
01:13:44.522 --> 01:13:47.644
- Just hang in there.
- Come on, buddy, faster!

1137
01:13:54.932 --> 01:13:56.564
I'll meet you
guys at the castle!

1138
01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.230
Stay out of sight, Olaf!

1139
01:13:58.231 --> 01:14:00.158
I will!

1140
01:14:11.868 --> 01:14:14.090
It's Princess Anna!

1141
01:14:21.698 --> 01:14:24.459
Are you g-gonna be okay?

1142
01:14:25.702 --> 01:14:27.762
Don't worry about me.

1143
01:14:27.763 --> 01:14:30.945
- Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick.
- My Lady.

1144
01:14:30.946 --> 01:14:34.303
Get her warm and find
Prince Hans, immediately.

1145
01:14:34.304 --> 01:14:36.342
We will. Thank you.

1146
01:14:36.343 --> 01:14:38.613
Make sure she's safe!

1147
01:14:56.450 --> 01:14:58.465
I'm going back out to look for
Princess Anna.

1148
01:14:58.466 --> 01:15:00.487
You cannot risk going
out there again.

1149
01:15:00.488 --> 01:15:01.614
If anything happens to her...

1150
01:15:01.615 --> 01:15:03.547
If anything happens
to the Princess,

1151
01:15:03.548 --> 01:15:05.778
you are all Arendelle has left.

1152
01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.537
He's in here. Prince Hans.

1153
01:15:10.538 --> 01:15:13.045
Anna. You're so cold.

1154
01:15:13.046 --> 01:15:14.320
- Hans, you have to kiss me.
- What?

1155
01:15:14.321 --> 01:15:16.047
Now. Now.

1156
01:15:16.048 --> 01:15:18.568
We'll give you two some privacy.

1157
01:15:18.569 --> 01:15:20.292
What happened out there?

1158
01:15:20.293 --> 01:15:22.048
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1159
01:15:22.049 --> 01:15:23.333
You said she'd never hurt you.

1160
01:15:23.334 --> 01:15:24.916
I was wrong.

1161
01:15:25.097 --> 01:15:26.919
Anna?

1162
01:15:28.681 --> 01:15:33.344
She froze my heart and only an
act of true love can save me.

1163
01:15:34.726 --> 01:15:36.807
A true love's kiss.

1164
01:15:46.576 --> 01:15:48.759
Oh, Anna...

1165
01:15:49.259 --> 01:15:52.481
If only there was someone
out there who loved you.

1166
01:15:52.482 --> 01:15:54.244
What?

1167
01:15:56.707 --> 01:15:59.488
You said you did.

1168
01:16:00.310 --> 01:16:02.813
As thirteenth in line in my own

1169
01:16:02.814 --> 01:16:05.349
kingdom, I didn't
stand a chance. I knew...

1170
01:16:05.350 --> 01:16:08.091
I'd have to marry
into the throne somewhere...

1171
01:16:08.092 --> 01:16:10.058
What are you talking about?

1172
01:16:10.059 --> 01:16:12.341
As heir, Elsa was
preferable, of course.

1173
01:16:12.342 --> 01:16:14.658
But no one was getting
anywhere with her.

1174
01:16:14.659 --> 01:16:16.064
- But you...
- Hans?

1175
01:16:16.065 --> 01:16:17.621
You were so desperate for love,

1176
01:16:17.622 --> 01:16:20.528
You were willing to marry
me, just like that.

1177
01:16:21.650 --> 01:16:23.632
I figured, after we
married, I'd have

1178
01:16:23.633 --> 01:16:25.648
to stage a little accident for Elsa.

1179
01:16:25.649 --> 01:16:28.174
Hans. No, stop.

1180
01:16:28.175 --> 01:16:30.068
But then she doomed
herself, and you were

1181
01:16:30.069 --> 01:16:31.994
dumb enough to go after her.

1182
01:16:31.995 --> 01:16:33.260
Please.

1183
01:16:33.261 --> 01:16:37.999
All that's left now is to kill
Elsa and bring back summer.

1184
01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:40.699
You're no match for Elsa.

1185
01:16:40.700 --> 01:16:43.329
No, you're no match for Elsa

1186
01:16:43.330 --> 01:16:46.333
I, on the other hand, am
the hero who is

1187
01:16:46.334 --> 01:16:49.635
going to save Arendelle
from destruction.

1188
01:16:50.197 --> 01:16:52.799
You won't get away with this.

1189
01:16:54.021 --> 01:16:56.502
Oh, I already have.

1190
01:17:01.147 --> 01:17:04.230
Please, somebody help.

1191
01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:09.775
Please, please!

1192
01:17:11.817 --> 01:17:13.484
It's getting colder
by the minute.

1193
01:17:13.485 --> 01:17:16.700
If we don't do something soon,
We'll all freeze to death.

1194
01:17:17.542 --> 01:17:21.886
- Prince Hans.
- Princess Anna is...

1195
01:17:22.306 --> 01:17:24.028
- Dead.
- What...?

1196
01:17:24.088 --> 01:17:27.112
What happened to her?

1197
01:17:30.493 --> 01:17:34.237
She was killed by Queen Elsa.

1198
01:17:35.279 --> 01:17:37.180
Her own sister.

1199
01:17:37.181 --> 01:17:40.363
At least we got to say
our marriage vows...

1200
01:17:41.805 --> 01:17:44.286
before she died in my arms.

1201
01:17:45.769 --> 01:17:47.769
There can be no doubt now,

1202
01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:51.427
Queen Elsa is a monster and
we are all in grave danger.

1203
01:17:51.428 --> 01:17:55.837
Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you.

1204
01:17:56.739 --> 01:17:58.479
With a heavy heart,

1205
01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.445
I charge Queen
Elsa of Arendelle with treason

1206
01:18:03.545 --> 01:18:06.628
and sentence her to death.

1207
01:18:18.618 --> 01:18:19.619
Hurry Up!

1208
01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:23.383
She's dangerous. Move quickly
and be careful.

1209
01:18:23.384 --> 01:18:25.686
The Door not open!

1210
01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:57.409
What is it, buddy?
Hey, watch it.

1211
01:18:57.410 --> 01:18:59.297
What's wrong with you?

1212
01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.782
I don't understand you
when you talk like that.

1213
01:19:05.302 --> 01:19:08.226
Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

1214
01:19:09.246 --> 01:19:11.649
No, Sven! We're not going back!

1215
01:19:11.650 --> 01:19:14.351
She's with her true love.

1216
01:19:20.612 --> 01:19:22.297
What the...

1217
01:19:24.501 --> 01:19:26.622
Anna!

1218
01:19:51.627 --> 01:19:53.668
Help.

1219
01:19:58.073 --> 01:20:01.016
Anna. Oh no.

1220
01:20:13.506 --> 01:20:18.132
Olaf?
Olaf. Get away from there.

1221
01:20:19.292 --> 01:20:22.319
So this is heat... I love it.

1222
01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.578
Ooh! But don't touch it!

1223
01:20:33.185 --> 01:20:36.894
So, where's Hans? What
happened to your kiss?

1224
01:20:36.895 --> 01:20:40.831
I was wrong about him.
It wasn't true love.

1225
01:20:40.853 --> 01:20:42.532
Huh. But we ran all the way here?

1226
01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:46.096
Please Olaf, you can't
stay here, you'll melt.

1227
01:20:46.097 --> 01:20:47.614
I am not leaving here until we find

1228
01:20:47.615 --> 01:20:50.180
some other act of true love to save you.

1229
01:20:50.181 --> 01:20:52.357
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1230
01:20:52.358 --> 01:20:55.357
I don't even know what love is.

1231
01:20:55.358 --> 01:20:58.589
That's okay, I do...
Love is...

1232
01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:01.871
putting someone else's needs
before yours, like, you know,

1233
01:21:01.872 --> 01:21:03.894
how Kristoff brought
you back here

1234
01:21:03.895 --> 01:21:06.216
to Hans and left you forever.

1235
01:21:08.919 --> 01:21:11.941
Kristoff loves me?

1236
01:21:12.703 --> 01:21:16.885
Wow, you really don't know
anything about love, do you?

1237
01:21:16.886 --> 01:21:17.907
Olaf, you're melting.

1238
01:21:17.908 --> 01:21:21.229
Some people are worth melting for.

1239
01:21:26.295 --> 01:21:29.057
Just maybe not right this second.

1240
01:21:30.479 --> 01:21:32.981
Don't worry, I've got it!

1241
01:21:34.582 --> 01:21:36.103
We're going to get through...

1242
01:21:36.104 --> 01:21:39.186
Oh, wait. Hang on.
I'm getting something.

1243
01:21:40.068 --> 01:21:44.411
It's Kristoff and Sven!
They're coming back this way.

1244
01:21:44.491 --> 01:21:45.972
They-they are?

1245
01:21:45.973 --> 01:21:49.456
Wow, he's really moving fast.
Huh... I guess I was wrong.

1246
01:21:49.457 --> 01:21:50.939
I guess Kristoff doesn't love

1247
01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.640
you enough to leave you behind.

1248
01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:54.701
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1249
01:21:54.702 --> 01:21:56.253
No, no, no, no, no. You need to

1250
01:21:56.254 --> 01:21:57.839
stay by the fire and keep warm.

1251
01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:01.048
- I need to get to Kristoff.
- Why?

1252
01:22:01.128 --> 01:22:03.749
Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

1253
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:06.071
There's your act of
true love right there,

1254
01:22:06.072 --> 01:22:08.554
Riding across the fjords like a valiant,

1255
01:22:08.555 --> 01:22:11.337
pungent reindeer king!
Come on!

1256
01:22:13.799 --> 01:22:15.601
Look out!

1257
01:22:24.269 --> 01:22:26.531
Back this way!

1258
01:22:27.092 --> 01:22:28.873
We're trapped.

1259
01:22:50.453 --> 01:22:52.655
Slide, Anna.

1260
01:23:00.984 --> 01:23:02.905
We made it!

1261
01:23:03.466 --> 01:23:05.807
Go, Go, Go, Go...

1262
01:23:17.598 --> 01:23:20.122
Come on, buddy, faster.

1263
01:23:21.602 --> 01:23:23.986
Kristoff!

1264
01:23:32.634 --> 01:23:34.874
Kristoff!

1265
01:24:29.687 --> 01:24:32.110
Sven!

1266
01:24:41.177 --> 01:24:43.319
Good boy.

1267
01:24:54.009 --> 01:24:55.931
Kristoff.

1268
01:24:59.055 --> 01:25:00.997
Anna!

1269
01:25:03.358 --> 01:25:05.059
Elsa.

1270
01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:07.943
You can't run from this!

1271
01:25:09.184 --> 01:25:12.926
- Just take care of my sister.
- Your sister?

1272
01:25:12.927 --> 01:25:15.519
She returned from the mountain
weak and cold.

1273
01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:18.412
She said you froze her heart.

1274
01:25:18.971 --> 01:25:22.376
I tried to save her,
but it was too late.

1275
01:25:22.576 --> 01:25:26.280
Her skin was ice. Her hair
turned white...

1276
01:25:26.580 --> 01:25:30.383
Your sister is dead...
because of you.

1277
01:25:30.384 --> 01:25:31.685
No!

1278
01:25:54.306 --> 01:25:56.028
Kristoff?

1279
01:25:57.650 --> 01:25:59.710
Anna!

1280
01:26:10.763 --> 01:26:12.622
Elsa?

1281
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:22.172
No!

1282
01:26:33.904 --> 01:26:35.903
Anna!

1283
01:26:36.706 --> 01:26:42.271
Oh, Anna... no... no, please no.

1284
01:26:47.255 --> 01:26:49.097
Anna.

1285
01:26:50.779 --> 01:26:52.720
Anna?

1286
01:27:32.979 --> 01:27:35.240
Anna?

1287
01:27:37.022 --> 01:27:39.224
Oh, Elsa.

1288
01:27:39.225 --> 01:27:41.726
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1289
01:27:42.748 --> 01:27:44.689
I love you.

1290
01:27:45.469 --> 01:27:49.974
An act of true love will
thaw a frozen heart.

1291
01:27:50.656 --> 01:27:53.117
Love... will thaw...

1292
01:27:53.619 --> 01:27:56.294
Love... Of course.

1293
01:27:56.295 --> 01:27:59.624
- Elsa?
- Love.

1294
01:28:45.927 --> 01:28:47.728
I knew you could do it.

1295
01:28:47.729 --> 01:28:51.566
Hands down, this is the
best day of my life...

1296
01:28:51.567 --> 01:28:54.146
and quite possibly the last.

1297
01:28:54.147 --> 01:28:56.957
Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.

1298
01:28:59.780 --> 01:29:02.802
Hey, my own personal flurry.

1299
01:29:12.632 --> 01:29:15.714
Anna? But she froze your heart.

1300
01:29:15.715 --> 01:29:19.458
The only frozen heart
around here is yours.

1301
01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:45.741
I will return this
scoundrel to his country.

1302
01:29:45.742 --> 01:29:47.685
We shall see what his twelve big

1303
01:29:47.686 --> 01:29:49.661
brothers think of his behavior.

1304
01:29:49.662 --> 01:29:51.328
Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.

1305
01:29:51.329 --> 01:29:53.028
This is unacceptable.

1306
01:29:53.029 --> 01:29:55.247
I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear.

1307
01:29:55.248 --> 01:29:58.453
I've been traumatized.
Ow! My neck hurts.

1308
01:29:58.454 --> 01:30:01.380
Is there a doctor I could... No?

1309
01:30:01.381 --> 01:30:04.126
I demand to see the Queen!

1310
01:30:04.127 --> 01:30:06.802
I have a message from the Queen.

1311
01:30:06.803 --> 01:30:09.270
Arendelle will henceforth and forever

1312
01:30:09.271 --> 01:30:11.141
no longer do business of any sort

1313
01:30:11.142 --> 01:30:12.867
with Weaseltown.

1314
01:30:12.868 --> 01:30:15.550
Weselton. It's Weselton!

1315
01:30:15.551 --> 01:30:19.288
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- Come on! Ow, Okay, Okay...

1316
01:30:19.289 --> 01:30:21.707
- Pole.
- Oops. So Sorry.

1317
01:30:21.708 --> 01:30:24.359
Okay. Okay. Here we are.

1318
01:30:27.082 --> 01:30:29.823
I owe you a sled.

1319
01:30:32.045 --> 01:30:33.658
Are you serious?

1320
01:30:33.659 --> 01:30:35.569
Yes. And it's the latest model.

1321
01:30:35.810 --> 01:30:37.350
No. I can't accept this...

1322
01:30:37.351 --> 01:30:40.413
You have to. No returns.
No exchanges. Queen's orders.

1323
01:30:40.414 --> 01:30:41.694
She's named you the official

1324
01:30:41.695 --> 01:30:44.517
Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.

1325
01:30:44.518 --> 01:30:46.398
- What? That's not a thing.
- Sure it is.

1326
01:30:46.399 --> 01:30:49.876
And it even has a cup
holder... Do you like it?

1327
01:30:49.877 --> 01:30:52.645
Like it? I love it...

1328
01:30:52.886 --> 01:30:55.208
I could kiss you!

1329
01:30:55.769 --> 01:30:57.821
I could. I mean I'd like to.
I'd...

1330
01:30:57.822 --> 01:30:59.907
May I? We me... I mean, may we?

1331
01:30:59.908 --> 01:31:01.995
Wait, what?

1332
01:31:02.015 --> 01:31:04.076
We may.

1333
01:31:07.218 --> 01:31:09.221
Summer!

1334
01:31:12.704 --> 01:31:14.946
Hello.

1335
01:31:31.122 --> 01:31:33.503
Are you ready?

1336
01:31:56.786 --> 01:31:58.546
I like the open gates.

1337
01:31:58.547 --> 01:32:01.089
We are never closing them again.

1338
01:32:03.231 --> 01:32:04.703
What? Oh, Elsa,
they're beautiful,

1339
01:32:04.704 --> 01:32:06.208
but you know I don't ska...

1340
01:32:06.209 --> 01:32:08.476
Come on, you can do it!

1341
01:32:08.776 --> 01:32:09.681
Hey, girls!

1342
01:32:11.779 --> 01:32:13.580
Hey, guys.
