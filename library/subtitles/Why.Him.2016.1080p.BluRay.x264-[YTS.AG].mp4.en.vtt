WEBVTT

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.037
Hey, babe.
So happy to see you!

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.232
Hi! I got your flowers.
That was so sweet of you.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.960
Of course.
Well, I know you're finishing

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.433
your Global Health
paper today

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.176
and you've been working
really hard on it.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.193
Well, I'm almost done,
so, maybe

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.797
you want to come over
and Netflix and chill and...

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.240
What?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.198
You mean you want to fuck?

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.237
I did not say that!

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.435
Oh, my God!
I know.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.120
No! I was being
more subtle than that!

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.200
I know. I'm sorry.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.555
Yes, I am so down for that.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.438
It's been like
three fucking days.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.160
My balls are
so blue right now,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.793
like dark blue,
Uh-oh.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.949
Like almost black.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.076
No, I'm fucking serious.
Here, check it out.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.589
I believe you.
I believe you.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.760
Okay.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.831
I'll see your
almost-black balls later.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.920
Cool, Steph.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.076
Come over any time after 6:00.
Okay, hun?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.117
Okay. Dude,
we are going to Netflix

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.873
and chill this shit so hard.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.077
Peaky Blinders. Kimmy Schmidt!

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.593
Movember's over.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.554
Time to shave the pornstache.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.514
Sorry. Making a Murderer!

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.119
Narcos!

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.033
Stranger Things!

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.555
Black balls!

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.556
Anyways,
Ned followed his dreams

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.517
and turned a run-down
old printing press

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.953
into the industry
powerhouse

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.156
known today
as the Fleming Company.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.976
Best boss in the world!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.036
The Fleming Company!

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.394
We're talking

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.551
brochures for
Steelcase furniture,

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.876
half the specialty jobs
in Grand Rapids

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.555
and who could forget
the Domino's Pizza circular?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.831
But before all that...

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.151
Ned met a young Michigan
Wolverine, Barbara Welsh.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.032
How did this
older guy get me?

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.715
Ned took her on their first date
to see his favorite band...

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.997
Kiss!
Kiss!

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.434
My favorite band, too!

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.828
Rock and roll!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.353
A few years later,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.715
the stork brought
my sister, Stephanie.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.199
Aw!

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.032
She's so cute.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.871
They weren't close at all.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.395
Oh, dropping her off at school.
Yeah.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.119
Then came me, Scotty F.

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.349
Did we have another child?

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.456
I forgot about that second baby.
Oh, we had another child.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.629
Anyways, Big Cheese.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:27.840
I'm sorry, guys.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.911
I promised myself
I wasn't gonna do this.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.353
Aw...

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.072
But I love you, Dad.
Happy Birthday.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.195
Way to go, Scotty!

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.793
I love you, too, buddy.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.200
Thank you. Wow!

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.472
That was fantastic.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.440
We've got
one last surprise for you.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.920
That's right.
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.752
live from her dorm room
at Stanford...

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.751
it's my sister, Stephanie!

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.679
Hi, everyone!
Hey, honey!

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.592
Hey, Steph!
Hey, it's Kevin!

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.352
Hi, Kevin!
Kevin.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.317
Can we see?
Sorry.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.198
Hi, Momma.
Hi!

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.395
Hi, Dad.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.754
The birthday boy.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.955
Hey, honey.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.871
You guys look like
you're having so much fun.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.519
And I wish I could
be there with you.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.278
She's so sweet.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.759
Yeah.
Get out.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.036
Yeah, I just wanted to say,
Dad, that I love you.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.519
I love you, too, honey.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.908
I love you more.
No, you don't.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.240
Love you to the moon
and back.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.072
I'll let you win this round.
Okay, Pops?

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.317
Even though you're now like...

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.675
...ancient.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.159
You are still...

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.400
What are you doing here?

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.993
You asked me
to come over.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.696
You're early.
I said after 6:00.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.896
All right.
Give me a sec,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.016
- I'm on the phone.
- Got it.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:33.296
Sorry.
It's just my friend. Anyway.

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.676
Happy birthday to you

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.836
Oh, my goodness.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.115
Oh, Laird, what are you...

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.336
Go finish your call.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.320
I'm just getting ready
to Netflix and chill, baby.

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.840
No, not now, Laird.
Oh, my goodness.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.920
Kimmy Schmidt!

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.176
Pull up your pants.
Marco Polo.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.918
Oh, my God!

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.640
How do you make it stop?

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.096
Whoa, whoa, Mom,
you just took a screenshot.

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.475
Happy, happy birthday
Happy, happy birthday

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.696
Kevin, help her out. Kevin.

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.790
Happy birthday, happy birthday

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:13.628
Mi oh my,
it's a wonderful life

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.510
It's a wonderful life
with you by my side

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.195
Mi oh my,
it's a wonderful life

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:26.990
It's a wonderful life
with you by my side

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.816
Hey, there he is.
Happy birthday, Big Cheese.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840
Thanks, Jim.

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.713
Jerry.
Hey, Ned.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.936
Fun dinner last night.
Hey, Jerry.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:34.960
Thanks. Lou.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.360
Hey, Cheese,
can I have a minute?

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:38.232
Sure. Good morning, Joyce.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.839
Great party.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.638
Hold all his calls.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.513
You gotta
be kidding me.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.432
Big Lots is
bailing out on us?

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.318
We've had that account
since '06.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.277
They're moving all their
print work to China.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.440
Oh, God.

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:55.398
Cheese, we're already getting
pummeled by Evite, Stamp-Free

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.959
and the rest of those
dot-coms.

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.634
And at this rate,
we'll be Chapter 11 by March.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.080
What about
Dick's Sporting Goods?

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.118
Well, I mean, I'm still
trading calls with my guy.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.236
But, Ned,
can I be honest with you?

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.000
I can't keep this
from Patty much longer.

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.874
Lou, haven't I
kept us going?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.795
Yeah. I mean,
it's what you do.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.554
I just need a little
more time. That's all.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.711
You are the maestro.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.075
Maybe you'll pull off
a Christmas miracle.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:23.549
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.915
By the way, good job keeping
that game face last night.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Oh. Thanks.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.399
That was some
shindig, man.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:29.480
Yeah, it was fun.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.152
Well, till the kid
had his farter

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.673
all over the screen
in 3-D.

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.989
I was like, "Whoa!

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:35.480
"That's a lot, man."

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.640
And get this...

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.358
Stephanie now wants us
to fly out...

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.159
to meet the man behind the
crack over the holidays.

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.760
With everything
that's going on here,

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:44.096
that's the last thing
I want to do.

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.439
Well, hold on now.

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.158
This is the first
serious boyfriend?

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.391
Yeah. Apparently.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.639
I mean, it's so strange.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.031
I mean, Stephanie and I
have always been so close.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.919
And yet she has never even
mentioned this guy.

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.354
That's the way
it goes, Cheese.

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:02.915
I thought I knew everything
about Lou Junior,

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.280
when he was down
at Ohio State.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.789
Out of nowhere,

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.757
he comes dragging home
this Buckeye

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.753
that he's been dating
for over a year.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.319
No.
Yeah.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.153
Nice girl, but still.
She's so controlling.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.318
I'm sorry.
I don't mean it like that

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:18.879
because I don't know her
that well.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.274
But I don't like her.

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.668
I don't.
Lou.

00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.353
It's just what happens,
you know?

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.476
Lou, what is the point
of all this?

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.199
Go out there and meet him.

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.271
I know we going through
a lot right now

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.830
but hell, Lou Junior is talking
about getting married in May.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.920
Married.

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.070
Once they're not
under your roof,

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:38.191
there's no telling
what they're into.

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.793
Oh, uh, that reminds me.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:41.336
He does want you
to speak at the wedding

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.669
and say some kind words.
Oh.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.195
I told him that I would
talk to you about it.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.960
And they'd like to get married
at your house in the backyard.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.031
Well...
But anyway...

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:55.313
I'm just saying you might want to
get out there and meet this kid.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.708
Because, I mean,
you saw it.

00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.155
You saw it,
he's a free spirit.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:00.880
You mean...

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.593
You heard him
come into the room.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:04.512
He came in there guns blazing.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.752
He had that revved up energy
where he was like...

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:09.075
bow-bow-bow-bow.

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.390
He just wants to go
and go and go...

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:13.710
and just morning,
noon and night,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.199
and "Stephanie, here I am.

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.920
"Stephanie, here I come.
I'm coming again."

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.672
I remember being that age,
don't you?

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:21.159
Just always ready.

00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:31.016
Come on, it's lovely weather

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:33.235
For a sleigh ride
together with you

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:35.314
Thanks for coming.

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:40.716
Oh, gosh,
it is so gorgeous here.

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.030
I'm very excited that you
guys are all out here.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200
We're very excited.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.096
There's a few things that
I wanna tell you about Laird

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.032
that I didn't feel like getting into
over the phone because...

00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.348
Watch, honey...

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:51.949
You missed our exit.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.496
Actually,
I missed it on purpose.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.953
Laird and I thought,

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.670
it'd be better if we all
stayed at his house.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:58.795
His house?

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.720
When did this come up?
Did you know about this?

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:04.071
Are you sure
his parents have enough room?

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.616
I mean, he doesn't
live with his parents.

00:09:05.640 --> 00:09:08.029
Honey, we're not gonna be
comfortable at some crash pad.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.589
He lives by himself.
It's not a crash pad,

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:12.318
but it's much nicer
than the Sheraton.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.913
Nicer than
the club floor?

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.399
I smooth-talked the manager.

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.516
We got a suite
at the regular rate.

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.636
What? That's what
I'm talking about, Big Cheese.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.438
That is impressive.
We have to turn back.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.192
Free continental breakfast.
Yes.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.736
Mint on the pillow,
turndown service,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.056
all things available
at the Sheraton.

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.536
I mean, is your lover
going to have that?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.790
Your lover? Your lover?

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.956
We already all know
that you've seen his penis.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.109
What?
Scott!

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.200
What?

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.476
Sleigh bells ring
Are you listening

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.948
Well, this is cute.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.872
Actually,
this is the gatehouse.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.595
Gatehouse?

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.917
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000
What the heck?

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:53.310
Is that
a facial recognition scanner?

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:55.555
Mmm-hmm.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:56.834
That's so cool.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:02.433
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is the new bird

00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:04.158
The hedge is moving.

00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:08.114
He sings a love song
As we go along

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.714
Walking in a winter wonderland

00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:13.917
Honey, who exactly
are you dating?

00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.976
Laird started this company
called Guerrilla Gang.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.399
You play Ape Assassins,
right?

00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.754
Are you kidding me?

00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.256
Yeah, that was my jam
in the eighth grade.

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280
Great, that's him.

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.476
So, he makes video games?

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.280
- Apps, Dad.
- This is it!

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.793
This is his house?
Mmm-hmm.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.316
Are you sure this isn't
an Apple Store or something?

00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.760
Oh, my God.

00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:32.239
What is up, you gang?

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.634
I know!

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.756
The Flemings are here.
You have arrived!

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:37.717
Hi, buddy. Hi.

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.434
Hello, sweetheart.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.549
Don't touch anything.
How was traffic?

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:43.696
It was okay.
Hi, they're here!

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.720
Hello.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:46.153
Hello to you, Ned Fleming.

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.760
Barbara.
Yes.

00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:51.110
You are perfect.

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:53.271
Well, thank you.
Oh, my God.

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.120
And this must be the main man.
Scotty, huh?

00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.151
Yup.
All right. Hey.

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.033
- Who are you?
- Gustav.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.553
I am Gustav. Yes.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.078
I never know
how to describe you.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.312
Um, well, estate manager
is cool, Stephy, yes.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.515
That works.

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.875
I used to run
the Four Seasons group in Asia

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:11.473
but after some point,
you know,

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.336
the corporate life becomes
a bit of a snooze-fest.

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.157
You know, "Tiffany's this,
Cartier that."

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.715
But, you know. Just dot,
dot, dot. Enough already.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.472
You know what I'm
talking about, Ned.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.840
Oh, yeah. Sure.

00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960
Boring.

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.673
Where's Laird?
Laird is upstairs.

00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.592
He is just finishing
a teleconference.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720
He'll be right out.

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.279
Oh, okay.
Why don't we go up then?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.360
Laird, I'm Ned.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.440
No, no, no.

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:31.576
No, this is Randy.
That's not Laird.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.600
He's our intern.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:36.036
Just graduated
summa cum laude at MIT.

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.997
So Randy, shake a leg.
Get their luggages.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.309
Yes, sir.

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:43.075
The motherfucking Flemings
are in the house!

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.160
Yes!

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:47.030
This is fucking awesome!

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.111
Get up here.
I'm so psyched to meet you.

00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:52.280
Family, baby.
Fuck yeah!

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.999
Oh, my God.

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.513
Scotty.

00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.752
Yes, my brotha!
Welcome.

00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.148
Hey, Barb.
Hi.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.869
Oh.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:05.960
Welcome.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.071
Hey, Ned. All right.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:09.593
Oh, yes.

00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:12.038
Yes.
Yes.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:13.474
Yes.
So glad you're here.

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.834
Yes.
Hey. Hi.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:16.075
Hey, baby.
Hi.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.909
I fucking missed you.

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.196
Why aren't you wearing a shirt
on your body?

00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:22.280
Oh.

00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.520
Don't worry about that.
I have a little surprise.

00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:27.273
Let's stay half an hour and
then we go back to the hotel.

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.032
That's a good plan.
Thank you.

00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.553
Dad, come on.
This place is so sick.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.477
Yeah, it's sick.
25 minutes.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.560
That's it.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.149
Hey! Just leave her alone.

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:41.713
Hey, oh, Ned. Ned.

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.314
Ned, would you look at that.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.833
That's your face, Sis.
Oh.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.194
Very good likeness.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.389
Oh, thanks. Yeah.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.199
The Stephy tattoo. I got it, like,
a week after we met, right?

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.918
One week. You know,
right on my heart.

00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.315
Great. Okay, do you guys
want to go see the house?

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:56.520
Uh...
We probably should...

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:58.671
We came to stop and say hey.
Yeah. We should go.

00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880
Actually, no.

00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.600
No. Before we go, um...

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:04.392
I have a little surprise
for everybody.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.710
Shit.
I'm fucking nervous.

00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:08.096
Do you want to
consult me about it?

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.256
You want to talk to me
before you...

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.271
You know what? No, I'm just
jumpin' in. All right?

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.480
I'm just going to do this.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.312
Laird, it's going to be
fucking great.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.078
Ta-da!

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.829
Oh, my God.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.238
I just got it done
this morning

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.958
Yeah.
I bet it's red, huh?

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.189
I need a little feedback.

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.436
Is that our Christmas card?
Yes.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.273
Yeah! That's exactly what
I used. How'd you know?

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.616
Look, he even got
Noodle in there.

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.789
Hurt like balls.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.396
Gosh, it says "Happy Holidays"
and everything.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:35.629
What?

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.677
Get the fuck out of here.
Okay.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:39.114
It says "Happy Holidays?"

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.280
Barb, fuck you.

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:41.634
God damn.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:43.512
I gave the guy
the Christmas card.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.136
I didn't know he put
"Happy Holidays" on there.

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.513
Wow.
Fuck.

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.472
Guess it's stuck on there,
huh?

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.908
Oops.
Fuck.

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:51.991
Well, you know,
you guys were coming over...

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.913
I was so excited, I just had
to do something, you know?

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:57.674
Well, that is something,
all right.

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.559
You know what? Sometimes, you
just got to say, "Fuck it."

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680
Fuck it!

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.829
You should...
Laird,

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.911
this is a 15-year-old child.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.513
So, we don't really...

00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.238
Oh, shit.

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:10.595
- You don't say fuck?
- No, Mom, I...

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:11.760
Heck yeah, I cuss.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:12.955
No, you don't.

00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:14.160
You do?
Yeah.

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.673
Oh, he cusses.
No, you don't.

00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:17.096
Yeah, bro, what's your
favorite cuss word?

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.120
Oh, boy.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.280
Don't egg him on like that.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.395
What's your favorite?

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.071
- Uh...
- Hmm.

00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:25.349
Titties.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:26.839
Titties? Titties.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.240
Stop it. Stop that.

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.713
Titties? Classic.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.871
Okay. We should be going.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.553
Nice one. What else you got?
Asshole.

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:35.216
Asshole.
All right. That's enough.

00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.376
Okay. Another good body part.

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:37.833
What else?
Dicking. Double dicking.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.479
Double dicking.
Okay.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.834
Wait. Hold on.
Double dicking?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.656
Are you happy?
That's a new one on me, bro.

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.680
What the fuck is that?

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:46.030
What the hell is that?
Is that like dick to dick?

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.476
Okay! Good night!
We're going to the hotel.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:52.757
This kid is nasty
and I fucking like it.

00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.239
Yeah.
Yes!

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:55.833
All right, let's do the tour.

00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.216
I'll show you around!
All right?

00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.468
Just throw your shit anywhere.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.960
You little double-dicker,
come on.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.040
Throw your stuff anywhere.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:02.314
By the way,
I'm a huge fan.

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.719
I'm part of
the online Ape Army.

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.840
Awesome.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.440
You know, this is what I was trying
to tell you guys in the car.

00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:09.118
This is okay here?

00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:11.358
Do you want to
take your coat off?

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.112
Uh, no.
Nope. I'm fine.

00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:14.599
Come on, guys.

00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:16.736
All right,
so this here's the kitch.

00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:18.273
This is where
we keep the food.

00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:19.475
The dining room.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:22.279
That's a sculpture
of a couple people fucking.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.711
Painting of a fat squirrel.

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.552
And this one's called
"Triple Team,"

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.999
self-explanatory.

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:30.438
All right. This is the den.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:33.433
These dudes are just
testing out video games.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.392
Ned, Stephy says that you're
pretty serious about your bowling,

00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.351
so I had
a couple lanes installed.

00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:42.195
Oh, my God.

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.376
None of this was here?

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.400
No.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.517
You said you were fixing
a crack in the foundation.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.272
Is that us?

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.870
Yeah, I got the images off
your league's Facebook page.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.189
That's so insane.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.828
Dad, look, he even got in
your signature "crotch chop."

00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.828
Oh, yeah.

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.040
Wow.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:01.336
All right, this here is
where we develop a few apps

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:03.237
for the Apple and
Android platforms.

00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.158
Hey, gang,
say hi to the Flemings.

00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:06.429
Hey, guys.
Hey, what's up?

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:09.398
Wait, I don't understand.
Do your employees live here?

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.358
Uh, maybe some of them do.
I don't really know.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:15.550
Gustav is actually
an amazing architect.

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.278
We designed
this place together.

00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.396
When did you
go to Machu Picchu?

00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.471
Hun, when did
you put these up?

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:23.358
What the heck is that moose?

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.669
That's a Phillip Manfredi.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.068
Great pick-up, Barb.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.277
Stephy told me that you're this amazing
art and photography professor.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.032
- That's awesome.
- Mmm-hmm.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.431
I teach a couple of classes
at a local community college.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.079
Don't be so modest, Mom.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:38.116
You're an amazing
photographer.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.271
Oh, that looks like
a real dead moose.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:43.794
Well, that's exactly
what it is, Ned.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.679
A dead moose
suspended in its own urine.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.478
It's meant to
symbolize the way

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.835
that our culture
has imprisoned our minds.

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080
Oh.

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:54.595
I got to tell you, Ned,

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:56.989
great art really
gets me aroused.

00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.720
It's actually
a very strong aphrodisiac.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.835
Laird.

00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.536
Not that you need any help getting
turned on by that gorgeous woman.

00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:04.629
Honey.

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.438
What? Your mom
is beautiful.

00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.471
She is. She deserves
some props for that.

00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:11.632
Well, I'll take a compliment
wherever I can get one.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:14.070
Well, here's another one.
You got a bangin' bod, too.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.195
All right.

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.554
Hey, what's going on,
everyone?

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.318
Richard Blais, everybody.

00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:21.995
This is the maestro
of molecular gastronomy.

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:23.673
Oh, my God.

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.990
That's that cute one
from Top Chef.

00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:27.798
Oh, he's the one
who goes, "Bam!"

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.236
No, that's Emeril.
He's a fucking dick, that guy.

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:32.668
Dickie Blais what's up?

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.435
Yeah, so Laird thought it would be a
fun idea to do a pop-up restaurant

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:37.680
just in your honor tonight.

00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.313
Did he?
Yeah.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:41.198
And I have here
a little amuse-bouche.

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.296
So if anyone's looking for
a little pre-dinner snack,

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.389
you can head on up here.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:46.232
Count me in,
'cause I'm famished.

00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:47.320
All right.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:48.520
There are so many surprises.

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:50.640
I know.

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.016
You're hungry, you've come
to the right place.

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.519
I've got surf
and turf for you.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.795
Steak and lobster.

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.075
Yum, yum.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:01.113
My version of surf and turf,
edible soil and plankton foam.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.759
Dig in.
Oh.

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:05.189
Wow, can't wait for dinner.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.360
No.

00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:09.680
Hey, so I think
it's going great, right?

00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.717
I think they've already
accepted me.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.314
I'm getting a little bit
of a different vibe.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.913
Oh, really?
Like what?

00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.399
Don't try so hard.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.834
I'm not,
what do you mean?

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:20.911
You put in a bowling alley
for my dad

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.953
and you got a tattoo of my
entire family on your back.

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.395
Oh.

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.520
Was the tattoo too much?

00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:27.715
Yes.
Fuck.

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.437
Shit, I knew it.

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.079
Yeah, Gustav said
the same thing.

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.309
Okay, don't worry...

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:36.392
I won't get any more tattoos
of them while they're here.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:37.629
Thank you.
Okay.

00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.875
I love you.

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.272
I love you, too.

00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.360
Okay.

00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.456
Oh, one more thing, stop
calling them motherfuckers

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:50.118
and talking about
how hot my mom is.

00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.999
Well, she's sneaky sexy,
took me by surprise.

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:57.073
Dude, she is a MILF,
like a genuine MILF.

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:00.397
And if it wasn't your MILF,
she'd be a MIWF...

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.073
a mother I would fuck.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.275
Mmm-mmm.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.998
But I won't.
Okay.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.871
Of course.
Thank you.

00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.638
All right, it's pretty.
Yeah.

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:15.840
You know...

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.640
It's a lot.

00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.479
Yes! I mean, the moose...
Yes.

00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:24.318
And the language.
Come on!

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.038
Mmm-hmm.
A real moose!

00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.230
And he's coming onto your mother.
That's not okay.

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.594
And the tattoo?

00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.957
The tattoo! And how...

00:19:32.120 --> 00:19:33.758
32
Oh, my. And you're...

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:35.069
22.
Yes!

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:37.310
You didn't like the mural
of you and Scotty

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.600
down in the new bowling alley?

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:40.756
The bowling alley
with the mural is...

00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:42.438
And the bowling alley
is regulation.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.113
That's quite nice

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.192
and that's very rare
to have something that nice.

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:48.696
And the polish
that he used was quite...

00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:49.720
It was good. But...

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.949
I'm sorry.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.480
I should have told you.

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.952
About everything, of course.

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:02.557
Honestly, I didn't know how to
explain him over the phone.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.432
I just kept imagining...

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.153
Mom Googling Laird Mayhew

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:08.629
and you guys
jumping to conclusions

00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.029
before you even got
a chance to know him.

00:20:11.840 --> 00:20:13.592
Well, now we know him.

00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.714
No, you don't.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.438
You've been here
for 15 minutes.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.560
Yeah.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.558
Thank you.

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:24.896
I wouldn't have asked you
to come out here

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.120
and miss Christmas in Michigan

00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:29.556
for the first time ever,
if he wasn't...

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.039
...really important to me.

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.669
Hmm.

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.320
Okay.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.150
You'll give him a chance?

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.675
Okay. Okay, thank you.
Thank you.

00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.872
Come here.

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.480
I love you.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.039
I love you, too.

00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.398
So if I did Google him,
what would I find?

00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.480
Don't do it.

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:05.600
Oh.

00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:06.715
Just don't Google him.

00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.880
Oh.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:11.317
Well, I still don't see it.

00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:15.351
Darling, this is the male,
and he's thrusting.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.520
Oh, God.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.313
All right, everybody,
dinner is served!

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:21.516
Scotty! Come on,
grab a stump.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.875
Dad, you wanna
go there? Mom.

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.656
You sure you don't want
to take off your coat?

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:26.680
No. I'm good.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.990
We do it family style here,
so everyone just dig in.

00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.479
It's super cas.

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.875
Okay, so we have three dishes
for this evening.

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.996
We have sous-vide geoduck.

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.957
We have Mission-style
sea urchin burritos...

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:38.040
Yum.

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.394
...with edible paper.

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:41.398
Because you're a printer.

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.039
And last but not least...
Sweet.

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:45.839
...we have smoked
California bear.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Enjoy.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.393
Oh, shit!

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:49.709
Thanks, Blais.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.199
- Bear?
- Mmm.

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.640
Yo, Scotty,
you see The Revenant?

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.994
No, I wanted to,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.216
but my parents don't really
let me watch R-rated movies.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.880
You're darn right we don't.
He's only 15.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:22:00.235
You want some paper?
Yes, certainly. Thank you.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.879
I don't know
what section that is.

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:04.156
Because that bear
fucked that dude up!

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.593
Now we're gonna
fuck this bear up.

00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.233
Hey, what about
that language?

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.400
Oh, shit. Sorry.

00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:11.036
Ah, I think I've got
the arts section here.

00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.272
You better slow down, Barb.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.440
You're gonna be full
before you get to the funnies.

00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:19.475
Ned.

00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:28.076
So, um, how did
you two meet?

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.749
Uh, you want me to go?
Yeah.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:31.880
Okay.

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.195
Laird sponsored
a talk on campus

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.599
with Doctor Joanne Liu,

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:37.160
the head of
Doctors Without Borders.

00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.280
Oh!

00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.356
Melinda Gates
got me totally pumped

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.880
about issues
in the developing world.

00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960
Now I'm obsessed.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:44.315
Wow.

00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:46.792
- That's Bill Gates' wife.
- Yeah.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.279
- She's great.
- Yeah.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.759
That's terrific.

00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.480
That's Steph's field of interest, too,
so that's great.

00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.749
Yeah, I know.

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.400
Ned, you should've
seen her at the talk.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.756
She asked the most intelligent
question. I was blown away.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:00.959
Really? What did I say?

00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.235
You were like...

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.616
"Hey, what's
the connection between

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:05.915
"women's health
and population density

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.599
"in indigenous communities?"

00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.990
I was like,
"Bam! Who's that?"

00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:11.792
That's so sweet of you
to remember that.

00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.791
Of course I remember. Mmm...

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.840
- The first time I saw you.
- That's our girl.

00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:17.776
She's always been the smartest
person in the room.

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:18.800
So true.
Yeah.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.990
And the sexiest. My God.
Well.

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:23.196
I couldn't keep
my eyes off her.

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.679
Her hair, and her eyes.

00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:25.795
Very pretty eyes.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.518
The way her spine
gently arches

00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.158
to meet the top
of her tailbone.

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:31.816
I just wanna pitch a tent and live in there.
You know what I mean?

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.960
No.
You're taking it too far.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.118
Quite the outdoorsman.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:36.872
I just mean
she's got a great body.

00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:38.553
Oh, well, yes.
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:39.994
She's a darling girl.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:41.296
- Like you, Barb.
- Great genes.

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:42.320
Okay.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.554
Two fit women.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.358
I'll have to
agree with you there.

00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.317
Ol' Slamming Bod Barb.

00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:50.710
Two fit women
and two lucky dudes...

00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:52.509
And one double-dicker.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.831
Okay, well.

00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.198
Laird, when did you graduate
from Stanford?

00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.192
Oh, I didn't go
to Stanford, bro.

00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.920
I hardly even graduated
from high school.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.868
He's being modest.

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.176
He actually
started writing code

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:10.555
for Sun Microsystems
when he was 13.

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:12.318
That's true.
Wow, that's just like me.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.120
I've been interning
at the Fleming Company

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.519
since, what,
the seventh grade?

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.869
Mm-hmm. Yup.

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.996
Future CEO,
but you are going to college.

00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.656
I know, Dad. I know. I know.
Just like your sister.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.671
So, Steph,
weren't your surprised

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.673
that this big tech mogul
wanted to date you?

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.154
He said he was some
low-level programmer at Uber.

00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:33.669
I had no idea that
he sponsored the entire event.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.875
So he lied to you.

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.359
Oh, Ned, I had to.

00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.875
I mean there are so many gold
diggers in Silicon Valley.

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.389
They just wanna fuck you
for your tech money.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.232
Language, baby.
You gotta be careful.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.391
I didn't spill the beans
till April.

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.518
April? That's
eight months ago. What?

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:50.033
Steph, over the phone,
you said

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.856
you've only known each other
for a couple of months.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.916
It was super casual at first.
No.

00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.115
No, it was not.

00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.430
We exchanged I love you's
on the third date.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.016
Remember? Right after we...
The third date?

00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.216
made love in the hot tub
at Esalen in Big Sur?

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:01.240
No, no, no.

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:03.236
Where, what?
Esalen in Big Sur.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.435
Really?

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.596
Ned. Don't get
the wrong idea.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.593
It was not sexual at all.
It was so much more than that.

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:10.920
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'm confused.

00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.399
Did you have
intercourse or not?

00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:13.788
Scotty, shut it.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.376
Dad, I'm just trying to
connect the dots here.

00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:16.799
Look. Yeah, we did.

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:20.555
But what I'm saying is
I was transformed.

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.757
Stephy opened up
like a flower.

00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.319
You should have seen it.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:28.438
I shouldn't have seen it,
but now I feel like I have.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.999
I just want
your parents to know

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.360
that you're
living with someone

00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.152
who's completely
devoted to you.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.592
Wait a minute.
What-ing with someone?

00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.796
You say you're living together?
Yeah.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.434
No. We do not.

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.631
Okay, five nights
out of seven.

00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.512
Your stuff is here.

00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.000
You don't really
stay at the dorm.

00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:49.600
Do you have
a toothbrush here?

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:50.760
Yeah.
That's cohabitating.

00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.797
Scotty, stop talking
and eat your paper.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.678
Dad,
we do not live together.

00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:56.319
Yeah, we're cohabitating.

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.636
"Opened up like a flower."

00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:06.633
Honey, I'm looking at
the Esalen website right now

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.313
and there's nothing
dirty about it.

00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:11.153
You go up there for yoga
classes and things like that.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.993
They've been practically
living together for a year.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.639
Why didn't she
just tell us that?

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.197
Where the heck are the towels?

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.871
He's even affected Scotty.

00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.997
What is a double dicking,
for crying out loud?

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.555
Oh.
Uh...

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:29.680
There she is.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:31.273
Oh, my God.
Oh, yeah. She's gonna...

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:33.440
She better explain what
the heck is going on here.

00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:34.520
All right,
so be nice.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.976
Be like, "Oh, my God.
I love your boyfriend. He's so normal."

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.194
I'm good.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.315
Hi.

00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:42.395
Hi, uh...

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.312
I thought you'd be Stephanie.

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.515
Steph's super pooped.

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.672
We had a big fight because of
the way I behaved at dinner.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.080
Don't worry, we took a shower
together and worked it out.

00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.029
But I snuck out
to have a little check in.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:57.200
Okay. Well...

00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:07.995
Ned, would you
come join us?

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.359
I'm good here.

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:12.869
Oh, please.
This is an Alaskan king.

00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:14.553
There's so much room.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:17.513
So much room.

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.231
It'd really mean
a lot to me. Please?

00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.029
Okay.

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.760
Hey.

00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.069
I owe you two
an apology.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.240
When I get nervous

00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.039
all kinds of crap comes
flying out of my mouth

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.031
and I know that's not
how you guys roll.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120
No.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.071
I was just trying
to make a good impression.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.912
Yeah. Well, you did.
It was...

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.116
I mean you didn't,
but it's okay.

00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.352
It was an awkward dinner.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.278
It was a unique
situation for...

00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:54.072
Yeah, but let's all
just move on.

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:56.478
Okay. Great.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.640
Truth be told,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.031
I haven't spent a lot of time
with parental figures.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.312
I don't know if you know this,
but I never knew my father.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.559
Yeah, he picked up my mom
in this bar in Oakland.

00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.837
They had some sloppy car sex,
and then never spoke again.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.955
Yeah.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.230
I'm not really close
with my mom, either.

00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.590
To be frank, she's kind of
a motherfucking bitch.

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.596
If I had a nickel
for every time I...

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:24.389
Yeah.

00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:26.755
We're sorry to hear that.

00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.638
That's some tough stuff, pal.

00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:30.074
Yup. That's...

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.640
That's...

00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.995
All right. Well,
it's getting late, so...

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.120
Yeah.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.957
I'm in love
with your daughter, dudes.

00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.394
And I'm just so
fucking psyched

00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:40.311
to get to know
the people that raised her.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.515
Mmm-hmm.

00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:45.353
And we're gonna do Christmas
just like you do at home.

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.555
Tomorrow night,

00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.949
I'm gonna throw a party
in your honor.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.016
Oh, you don't have to
go to the trouble.

00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.109
You don't... It's not.

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.760
We're gonna do
all the holiday shit.

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.436
Okay. Hmm.
All the shit.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:59.990
Ned, I'd love some
guy time with you.

00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:02.310
So maybe we could take a walk
tomorrow morning?

00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.799
Okay.
Okay, cool.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.110
Justine, will you set Ned
an alarm for 6:30 a.m.?

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.280
You got it, Laird.

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.199
Ned, an alarm's been set for
you for 6:30 en la mañana.

00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.918
What? Who is that?

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.033
That's Justine.

00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:20.192
Yeah, she's like Siri,
but awesome.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:22.197
I got that chick from
The Big Bang Theory,

00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.679
Kaley Cuoco,
to do the voice.

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:24.840
J, say hi.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:27.190
Hey, Ned. Hey, Barb.
How are you guys?

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.075
- Hi.
- Oh, my God.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.792
Stephanie's told me
so much about you.

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.359
Anything you need, I'm here.

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.669
- Okay.
- Thank you.

00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:36.990
She can't...
Can she see us?

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.315
She says that she can't,
but I think that she can.

00:29:41.480 --> 00:29:43.240
What the fuck
are you talking about?

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.509
You know I can't see them.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.069
She's a perv.

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.240
Laird.

00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.352
Anyway, I hope you two have
a nice night's rest.

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.039
Yeah, have a good night.
Great night.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.235
Have a great night.
Yeah.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.396
My instinct is to
hug you right now.

00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.278
- Oh. No.
- I don't think you...

00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.629
That's okay.
Oh.

00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.711
Oh, my God.
Barb.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.074
Good night.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Peace.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.230
Baby, I want to trim your...

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.555
Baby, I want to trim your...

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.589
Baby, I want to trim your...

00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.391
Beautiful Christmas tree

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.913
I'm gonna bring along
my hatchet

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.909
My beautiful Christmas balls

00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.438
I'll sprinkle my snow
upon your tree

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.751
And hang a mistletoe
on your walls

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.311
Baby, I want to trim your...

00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.958
Oh, beautiful Christmas tree

00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:11.556
Barb? There's
no toilet paper.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.680
Uh-oh.

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.398
Would you get
a roll for me, please?

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:15.953
Papa make a poopie?

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:17.951
Yes. I made a poopie.

00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.394
Did Daddy do a doo-doo?

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.636
Barb, just get
the toilet paper, please?

00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.392
All right.
Well, you sit tight.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.833
I'm gonna go find you some TP.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Thank you.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.160
Of course.

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.792
Mr. Playboy.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.632
Unbelievable.

00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:35.349
Who is that?

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:38.471
She's a bit of a Plain Jane.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:39.834
Darling?
Yeah. Yup.

00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.759
Just, um, crack the door
and toss the roll, please.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.997
It's gonna be a little
more complicated than that.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.639
Good morning, Ned.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:49.469
It's Gustav.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:50.600
Great.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.996
As I've already told Barb,
we are a paperless household.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.159
Paperless? What?

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.195
It's a paperless
house, darling.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.509
I got that.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:04.719
But how am I supposed to
complete my business?

00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.518
Well, all Japanese toilets

00:32:06.680 --> 00:32:09.114
have a very effective
and pleasant cleaning spray.

00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:10.469
And I will be very happy

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:12.790
to walk you through the entire process.
Oh, God.

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.838
Ned, please locate the
control panel to your left.

00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:18.472
Okay, I see it.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:20.080
Now on that
control panel is a button

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.794
that shows an image
of water spraying up.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.797
Okay. And I just push it?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.149
Just press it, yes.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:32.079
Was that cologne?

00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.559
Oh!
Cologne? Oh, yes!

00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:36.194
That is a designer-scented
talcum powder.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:39.195
But that button should
not have activated that.

00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.193
Ned, that is what is called Big
Pony for Men by the Ralph Lauren.

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:43.429
I'm excited to try.

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.872
Can we please just continue?
All right.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:48.393
Ned?
Yes.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:50.551
I would like to apologize
sincerely again.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.190
This is the 2018 model
that you are on right now,

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.475
so they have not yet made

00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.551
an instruction manual
in English yet.

00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:00.871
So I'm going to take care
of this on my end, all right?

00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.753
So Ned, you focus on
your end in there

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:06.554
and I will focus
on your end out here.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:08.553
That's too good.
This is it.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.392
This should do it, Ned.

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:12.040
Okay. Something's whirring.

00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.036
Something's spinning around
in there.

00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.911
No! Turn it off!

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.116
Turn it off!
Turn it off! Turn it off!

00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.400
God!

00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:21.759
Oh, scheisse!

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.070
We are having some
technical difficulties.

00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:25.798
That was the vaginal cleanse.

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:26.920
The what cleanse?

00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:28.752
I just want a square
of toilet paper.

00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.069
The vaginal cleanse.

00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.514
Which I hear is refreshing

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:33.636
and apparently
also very stimulating.

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.429
Just saying.

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:42.960
Ned?

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:45.080
Really?

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.440
I'm so sorry, Ned...

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.831
but I'm going to have to manually
reboot the system from the inside.

00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:52.275
In here?

00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:53.759
I am so sorry.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:54.955
Fine.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.955
Why not?

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.795
Barb, would you
close the door? Sorry.

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.393
It's gonna be great.

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:08.792
Ned, I am blinders.

00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.515
I see nothing.
I smell nothing.

00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.471
The print is very small.
Mm-hmm.

00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:15.834
Okay, forgive me.

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.591
I can't see the instructions.

00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:25.032
All right.
What do we have here?

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.320
Hmm...

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:59.038
I had some
stomach problems last night.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.033
I think it was the bear.

00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:03.470
I can guarantee you,
it was the bear.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.837
Turning on the fan.

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.710
Great. Wunderbar.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.519
How'd it go?

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.389
I am so sorry
that it took so long.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.915
Ned, I'm going to need you
to be completely still

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:25.355
while we try to
lock in your location.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:27.835
I'm sitting on a toilet,
that's pretty still.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.355
Searching,
searching, und searching.

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:32.869
And we have target achieved!

00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.519
And sploosh!

00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:35.715
Oh!

00:35:47.560 --> 00:35:49.551
There you go, girls.

00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:51.073
You raise chickens?

00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:52.912
All free-range.

00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.274
Cows, too.

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.795
Pigs, artisanal llamas.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.313
Everything you eat here

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.550
comes from within
a 500-yard radius.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.115
I call it
"lawn to table eating."

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.280
There she is.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:05.954
Hey, Daisy.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.833
Oh.
Hi.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.072
Go on, get.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:13.880
So glad we're
doing this, Ned.

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.056
I feel like I know you after everything
that Steph's told me about you,

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.638
but still not the same...

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.554
Do you submit?
Fuck you!

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.273
Gustav!
Ned, stay away!

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.400
You wanna fight?

00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:33.800
Tap out!
No!

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.075
You want to tap out.

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.832
Okay, okay! Fine!

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.479
Nice work!

00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.136
And your reactions
are getting quicker.

00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:43.160
Really?
Absolutely.

00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:44.280
Thanks.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:46.480
I am so sorry, Ned. I just
didn't want you to get hurt.

00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.953
Wait, so you just do
this Pink Panther thing?

00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.519
Pink Panther?
Pink Panther?

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:54.955
The Pink Panther
from the Pink Panther movies.

00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:58.317
When Cato attacks Inspector
Clouseau to keep him sharp.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:00.096
Are those really old?
I never heard of it.

00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.155
I'm not familiar, either,

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.833
but it sounds
absolutely charming.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:05.959
Pink Panther.

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.513
The movies?
Mm-hmm.

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:11.670
Cato is his assistant,
his houseboy.

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:13.193
Houseboy?
Well, it's...

00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.316
That sounds racist.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.628
He did call him "my little
yellow friend." But...

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:20.096
I'm sorry, you have to
understand, Ned.

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.680
Laird is the CEO
of a massive tech company.

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:24.472
I don't like
bodyguards around

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.473
so I have Goose train me in case
I get kidnapped or whatever.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.319
By the way, your Chun Kuk Do
moves were very solid.

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.152
But what happened to
the evasive parkour?

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.514
Ah, evasive parkour.
Yeah.

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.033
I totally fucking spaced!

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.838
There's always
room to improve.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.035
All right.
Thanks, man.

00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.519
You got it, brother.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.352
All right, ciao for now,
you friends.

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.954
And you guys have
a lovely chat.

00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:46.640
Ned, come on. I wanna
show you my office.

00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:51.398
You know, that's like
classic Pink Panther.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.400
- This is where you work, huh?
- Yeah.

00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:58.552
I have a den in the house
where I do the financial stuff

00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.915
but this is where
all the big ideas happen.

00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.991
Don't you need
a computer and...

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.196
Nah. My girl Justine
records everything.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:06.475
Right, J?

00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.398
Yep, I'm here.
Hey, Ned.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:11.640
Hey, why don't you play back
a blip from yesterday's session?

00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.336
All right, hold on. Fuck. There's
so much shit up here in your Cloud.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.554
Okay, okay got it.

00:38:15.720 --> 00:38:18.393
Come on, idiot, think.
Names for games. Um...

00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.353
Ape Assassins Six:
Capuchin Chaos.

00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.875
Uh, Silverback Salsa.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.235
Baboon Bukkake.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:27.628
Fuck! Wow, that's awful!

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:28.755
Bad idea.

00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:29.915
Why? Why's that?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Uh...

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:32.559
What does that mean?

00:38:32.680 --> 00:38:33.680
Bukkake?

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.029
Oh, um...

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:36.958
Just means a lot of
things are happening

00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.256
and you're feeling
overwhelmed.

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.554
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:41.597
Yeah.
I've felt bukkake before.

00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:42.720
Hmm...

00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:48.074
Grab a seat. Make yourself
comf. Let's break it down.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.230
Just pop down
right here on the floor.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:55.868
There you go.

00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:01.072
Ned, I think you and
I have so much in common.

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.550
We see something we want
and we just dive in

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:05.720
and we take it.

00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:06.760
Know what I mean?

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.035
Yeah.

00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.788
Which is why...

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.074
...on Christmas Day...

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.717
I'm going to ask Stephy
to marry me.

00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:29.960
And I know
how tight you two are.

00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080
Mm-hmm.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:33.759
So I'd really, really

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:34.955
like your blessing.

00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.318
Uh, Laird.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:42.616
Really appreciate
you coming to me.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.640
'Course.

00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:45.990
But, uh, the answer's no.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.151
Dude, I'm so confused.

00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:54.356
What the fuck?
What the hell?

00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:55.794
This went so much differently

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.353
when I rehearsed it
with Gustav.

00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.636
Yeah. I asked you
and you were like,

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:01.113
"Yeah, dude. My son."

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:03.151
Laird. Listen to me, okay.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:07.469
Beside the fact that I don't know
you from a hole in the wall...

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.474
Stephanie is just not ready
for this step in her life.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.632
Oh, I'm totally getting
the signals that she is.

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:17.439
I'm her father,
I know her pretty well.

00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:19.437
Okay, all right.
All right, Ned...

00:40:19.640 --> 00:40:21.278
Dude, I know
I sprung this on you.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.994
My bad. Okay?
Let's just back it up.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:25.195
All right?
All right.

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.517
Why don't you give me a few
days to win you over, okay?

00:40:28.680 --> 00:40:29.874
And by Christmas morning...

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.508
I promise, you're going to be
calling me "son."

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.477
I'm gonna be
calling you "Dad".

00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.816
Don't think
that's going to happen.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.831
I think it's gonna, Dad.

00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:40.840
Don't.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:42.789
Dad, come on.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.536
Don't call me "Dad."
Don't call you "Dad"?

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:45.560
I'm not your dad.

00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.836
I mean,
you're gonna be my dad.

00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:48.920
No. No.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.758
What, Dad?

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:54.480
Okay, now you're
playing with me.

00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:56.391
All right. Dad.

00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.758
Look, Laird.

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:03.508
Why do you even care
about what I think?

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.033
You're Stephanie's father.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:09.039
I'm not gonna ask Stephanie to marry
me unless I have your blessing.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.194
Okay.

00:41:11.400 --> 00:41:12.674
Justine, did you get that?

00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:14.558
Totes.
Yeah, recorded every word.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:17.711
Totes. And totes is what?

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.758
It means totally. But totally's kind of long,
so "totes" is just easier.

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:23.720
Okay. Good.

00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:24.840
Okay.
Okay.

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.074
All right, cool.
Yeah.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.549
But you gotta
promise me

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.871
that you won't tell Steph
anything about this.

00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:33.594
About any of this.

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:36.394
Trust me, that is the last
thing in the world I will do.

00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.120
For reals, dude.
I want it to be a surprise.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.633
No word. I won't say a word.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:42.916
Barb and Scotty, too.
No clowning.

00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.475
No clowning.

00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:47.709
What?

00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:50.110
I'd just feel a lot better
about this if we pinky swore.

00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.795
Oh.

00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:01.277
I see what you mean.
Cool.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.712
Go get breakfast.
Okay.

00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:06.309
Fuck!

00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:08.429
Sup, guys?

00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:10.397
- Hey, boss.
- Mayhew!

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.616
...took a little longer

00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:15.438
Go into the school
gonna run another banger

00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.991
The fuck?
Come with me immediately.

00:42:18.840 --> 00:42:20.398
The hell is this room?

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.669
Randy, get the fuck out.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:22.955
Yes, sir, Gustav.
Mm-hmm.

00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.150
I am on the needles und pins.

00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:30.038
I need you to tell me
how it went right now

00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.155
or I'm going to burst.

00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:33.157
He said no!
What? Okay, okay.

00:42:33.360 --> 00:42:36.113
But how did you respond?

00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.959
I was blindsided, man.
I didn't know what to do.

00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.160
I challenged him.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.197
Okay.
I started calling him Dad.

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:45.510
Oy vey.
The fuck, man!

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.753
Why would you call him Dad?
You're putting him at unease!

00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:51.799
You have to find a way in.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.309
You have to do something
for him that's truly special

00:42:54.480 --> 00:42:56.835
so that he knows
that your intentions are pure.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.920
Dude, Goose, I don't know
how to talk to the guy.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.200
It's like we speak two different
languages or something.

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.320
You do.
Yeah.

00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:03.674
He speaks English.

00:43:03.840 --> 00:43:07.469
And you speak English with
resounding amounts of "fuck."

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.016
All right, Stephanie's been
on my case, too.

00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:10.040
Yes.
I got it.

00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:11.160
All right?
Okay.

00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:12.200
Right.
All right, man.

00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:13.360
Great.
Great.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.936
You just fucking really
hit me really hard.

00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.393
I know. I am sorry.

00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.518
It's just, Laird...

00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:22.035
...your relationship
with Miss Stephanie

00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.708
is very special.
It's the real deal.

00:43:24.840 --> 00:43:25.840
Hey.
Yes.

00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.838
Goose, I know I pay you
a shit-ton of money,

00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.359
but you're my best friend.

00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.636
Our friendship is priceless.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.030
Hey. Thanks, brother.

00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.514
Okay.

00:43:48.880 --> 00:43:51.075
Okay. Ow! Mercy. Mercy.

00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:53.520
Fuck.

00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.600
Bro, you're incredible.

00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.875
That was very imaginative

00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.439
how you took that
tender moment

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:00.960
and used it
as your pivot to attack.

00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.314
Yeah.
Very good.

00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:07.080
What's up, Cheese?

00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.076
I'm about to go to
the football game.

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:10.434
Lions, baby!

00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:11.874
Great. How's business?

00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.229
Tell me something good.

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.594
Oh, uh...

00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:17.110
I talked to my guy
over at Dick's Sporting Goods.

00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:18.856
Don't tell me
they're going with China, too.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.915
Worse.

00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:21.957
Freaking online banner ads.

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.917
No. Damn it.
All right, listen.

00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.269
I'm gonna call Don Millis at
Subaru of Southern Michigan.

00:44:28.440 --> 00:44:31.398
I heard a little rumor that they might
be looking for a new dance partner.

00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.113
Yeah, Don,
the big guy, right?

00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.032
You guys go back
to your car selling days.

00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:36.872
Yeah. It's worth a shot.
Listen...

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.632
I need you to go in
and pull his card

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.256
from my rolodex
while I look for a pen.

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:42.077
You got it, Cheese.
No, you got it.

00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.312
So how goes it in Cali?

00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:48.436
It feels like we've landed
in The Twilight Zone.

00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:49.600
Did you find the card?

00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.309
Yeah. I got it right here.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:53.833
Just hang on.

00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.393
I have nothing
to write with here.

00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:56.993
This whole house is paperless.

00:44:57.120 --> 00:44:58.120
Paperless?

00:44:58.280 --> 00:44:59.599
Well, how do you
wipe your ass?

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:00.720
You don't.

00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.916
They have these Japanese
toilets that...

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.880
It's one of those little
squat jobs, little squatter.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.639
No. Just... never mind.
Just give me the number.

00:45:08.800 --> 00:45:10.119
Hey, Ned, I'm here.

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:11.599
I can take it down for you.

00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.990
Justine, please just...
I'm fine.

00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.160
Just go away.

00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:16.616
All right,
I'm just trying to help.

00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.920
You don't have to be
such a dick.

00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:20.310
Whoa, whoa.
Cheese, who is that?

00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.656
She's got a foul little mouth.

00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.296
Is that the kid's secretary
you fighting with?

00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:25.754
No, no, no. That's the woman
who lives in the ceiling.

00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:26.920
Cheese, what she look like?

00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:27.960
The woman who lives...

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.176
You say she lives
in the ceiling?

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.919
She's a disembodied
voice that...

00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.678
Never mind.
I'll explain later.

00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:34.875
The voice sounds sexy.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.200
Are they using
somebody famous?

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.231
I wouldn't say too famous.

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.496
You know,
million dollars a week,

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.296
biggest show in the world,
no big deal.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.320
Lou.
She can hear me?

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.120
Of course I can hear you.

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.309
How you doin', baby?

00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:47.436
Better now
that I'm talking with you.

00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.600
Just give me the number.
I'm calling him now.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:55.353
Let's catch some waves.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.856
- Tsunami.
- That guy's cool.

00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.880
Yeah, Goose is the best.

00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.515
Oh...

00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:07.456
Laird, I'm gonna be
honest with you, buddy.

00:46:07.480 --> 00:46:08.480
Okay.

00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.511
Gorillas in board shorts
is a fun touch.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:11.680
Yeah.
I'll give you that.

00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:13.536
But when the only mission
is to get to shore,

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:14.920
I'm not feeling
enough drama there.

00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.040
You know?

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:19.355
You know what?
You're so fucking right.

00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.555
Fuck!

00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.376
We've been developing this
limp dick for months.

00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.016
You come and
you play it for five minutes,

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.712
you know exactly
what's wrong with it.

00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:28.030
You're a sharp little fucker.
You know that?

00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.879
Thank you.

00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:32.031
I mean, for real, man.
I appreciate it.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.399
It's just nice
to be listened to.

00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.349
What do you mean?

00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:38.336
I'm gonna be running
my dad's business one day.

00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.360
Uh-huh.

00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:42.352
But he won't even listen to any
of my ideas about innovation.

00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.033
What?
Right?

00:46:44.200 --> 00:46:45.394
You're next gen, dude.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.920
It's where all the new seeds come from.
Everyone knows that.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.176
And I told him that.
I was like...

00:46:49.200 --> 00:46:51.668
"Dad, if you're gonna unleash
me to my full potentsh...

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.960
"I need a seat
at the table."

00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.195
He just won't
listen to me.

00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:55.588
Um... Get that seat!

00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:56.760
I will get that seat.

00:46:56.920 --> 00:46:58.640
Gotta get that seat, Scotty.
That's my seat.

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.908
Nobody else touch it.
No.

00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.719
Where is that seat?
It's at the fucking table.

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:04.956
And I'm gonna
get that seat at that table.

00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.872
You deserve
a fucking throne, dawg.

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.400
Yeah, the Iron Throne.
Iron Throne.

00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.056
Iron Throne.
Game of Thrones over here!

00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:12.216
I'm breathing fire and grabbing
titties left and right.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:13.416
Fucking King Joffrey
up in this.

00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:14.440
Those are my titties!

00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.551
You're the next in line.
That's me.

00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.920
My man.

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.754
Oh, God.

00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.594
They're paying
your student loans.

00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:29.195
Oh.

00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:42.119
Stamp Free Invites.

00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:50.753
Oh, man.

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.116
Ho, ho, ho!

00:47:58.760 --> 00:47:59.795
Wow.

00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:01.240
Is that a horse?
That is a llama.

00:48:01.440 --> 00:48:02.440
Oh, a llama.
Hi.

00:48:02.520 --> 00:48:03.635
Hello.

00:48:03.800 --> 00:48:05.631
Oh, my goodness.
Hey, girl.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:07.119
We don't have those in...

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.639
Dad!

00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:10.950
There you are.
This is insane!

00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.473
Oh, you working on the books?

00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:14.471
Uh, yeah, you know.
Just the little stuff.

00:48:16.120 --> 00:48:18.475
I was thinking about
Laird's Christmas party.

00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.471
Gustav gave me a preview
of the guest list.

00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.551
And, Dad, it is a veritable
"who's who"

00:48:22.640 --> 00:48:24.039
of Silicon Valley
power players.

00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:25.838
Tyson Modell is coming!

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.831
Wait, who is he?
What?

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.016
He's the kid
who founded Ghostchat.

00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.109
Oh, right.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:31.696
He turned down three billion
dollars from Facebook,

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.153
and he's only
24 years old.

00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:35.470
I'm gonna broker a sit-down
between you two.

00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:38.716
Dad, thank you for telling me
to pack a blazer.

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:41.096
Now, should I throw on a tie or
should I keep it business casual?

00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:42.678
Scotty, just listen to me,
all right?

00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:44.910
Most of these
Internet companies

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.036
are built on
smoke and mirrors.

00:48:47.200 --> 00:48:48.235
What?

00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:49.360
Don't get sucked in.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.670
That whole industry
is based on hooey.

00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:53.956
I'm gonna drop
some knowledge on you.

00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:55.354
Times are changing, Pops.

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.556
And not everything you think
is hooey is hooey.

00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.671
Wow. That's profound.

00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.394
Profound.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.794
And you...

00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:07.157
Hooey-meister himself.

00:49:09.080 --> 00:49:10.911
You're nothing but an octopus.

00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:13.119
An octopus.

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:29.152
Merry fuckin' Christmas

00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:44.399
What are you pouring?

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.391
We are doing a deconstructed
eggnog tonight.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.596
Eggnog. Yes. Thank you.

00:49:48.760 --> 00:49:50.034
Where you from, boss?

00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:51.120
Michigan.

00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:52.753
Oh, Michigan.
You in the car business?

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:55.036
Uh, no. Printing.
Ned Fleming.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.758
Elon Musk.
Elon Musk?

00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.509
Yeah.
Tesla, Elon Musk?

00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.914
Yeah.
Wow.

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:02.240
How do you know Laird?

00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:03.714
Uh...

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.597
He's dating my daughter.

00:50:06.800 --> 00:50:08.074
Uh-oh.

00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.434
Nice talking to you.
Yeah.

00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.635
What?

00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.116
Oh, hey! Hi, honey!

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.470
Could I get a glass
of white wine, please?

00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:19.753
Ooh, hiya, handsome.
Hi!

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:21.592
You look great.
Oh, come on.

00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.432
No, you do.
Thank you.

00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.319
I'm just getting in
the holiday spirit.

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:30.155
So what were you talking to
Laird about for so long?

00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.791
I got the entire
Mayhew family saga.

00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.279
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.432
No, no, turns out it was
pretty interesting actually.

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:40.751
His mother was a secretary at
one of these tech companies.

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:43.275
Can I interest you
in a Kobe beef slider?

00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:44.759
Ooh, yum.
Real food?

00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.797
Yes, I'm starving.

00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.518
Wait, what?

00:50:48.840 --> 00:50:50.239
Oh, God.

00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:52.078
Ma'am? Kobe squirt?
No, thanks.

00:50:52.240 --> 00:50:53.240
Thank you.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.433
It's actually pretty tasty.

00:50:55.600 --> 00:50:58.592
Anyway, she saw all these
young programmers getting rich.

00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:01.320
So she basically
forced Laird

00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:05.439
to spend his entire childhood
inside, learning computers.

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:09.273
I think that's
kind of sad, right?

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.313
He ate it.
Hmm.

00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.159
He's an octopus.

00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:26.151
That kid is
wrapping his tentacles

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:27.998
around every member
of this family.

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.513
He's manipulating you.

00:51:29.680 --> 00:51:31.989
Darling, we need to bring this
down a notch.

00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:34.310
Okay? You think you're
at war with Laird.

00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.153
But he's not fighting.
It's just you.

00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:38.976
Come on,
let's go meet his friends.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.035
They look darling.

00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.832
Oh, God.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.958
Totally tanked porting the
thin-client apps for the JDK build.

00:51:45.160 --> 00:51:46.536
The fuck? So you had to
rewrite all the code?

00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:48.551
Mm-hmm. By myself.

00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:50.915
But did you do it?
Oh, you know I did!

00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.479
Hey, there they are!
Hi.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.640
Looking like a babe.

00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.869
Look who's looking sharp.

00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.314
Okay!
Hello!

00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:58.800
Tyson, these are Stephanie's parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Fleming.

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.871
Oh, no. Barb and Ned, please.

00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.758
So it was fucked up, man.

00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.512
It took me two weeks

00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:06.358
on the J2EE database...

00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:08.696
trying to get the interface
to react with the server...

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.711
so I can get the containers
up and running again.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:15.192
I'm sorry.
Tyson, what's a J2EE?

00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:17.231
Java 2 Platform
Enterprise Edition.

00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.714
Do you not write code?
Sorry.

00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.359
This guy's the worst.
Yeah.

00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:22.640
I'm actually more of a personal
relations kind of guy.

00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:25.280
Like account management, client services.
That kind of stuff.

00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:27.078
Dude, this kid is
fucking awesome.

00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:30.676
Yes, Ned is grooming Scotty
to take over our family business.

00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.840
That's right.

00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:33.552
We own a printing business
in Michigan.

00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.936
Really?
I'm sure you're familiar

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.280
with those two siblings
over there

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.072
since you're
in the printing business.

00:52:38.240 --> 00:52:40.515
Yo, brother-sister act!
You gotta meet this guy.

00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:41.600
Hello!

00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.432
Hey! Blaine
and Missy Pederman.

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.749
Hi, I'm Barb Fleming.

00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.239
This is my husband.
Ned.

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.868
I'm Scott Fleming.
Nice to meet you.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.712
I'm sorry, we were told
we might know you,

00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.074
but I'm afraid we don't.

00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:54.754
Blaine and Missy started
Stamp Free Invites.

00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.431
Oh, okay.

00:52:58.600 --> 00:52:59.749
Right.

00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.920
What's up?

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.456
Did the server forget
to send a reminder

00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:04.311
for your birthday party
or something?

00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:07.438
No, he is actually
in the printing business.

00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.759
Oh, shit.
Whoops.

00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.880
No, no.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.256
We didn't put you
out of business or anything?

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.280
No.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:15.675
What? Ruin our business?
No, no.

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.512
We're doing quite well.
Thank you.

00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:18.635
Oh, that's great!

00:53:18.760 --> 00:53:20.136
Good for you!
Honestly, good for you.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.832
We love little
mom-and-pop printers.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:24.076
So inspirational.
So important. Mm-hmm.

00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:25.593
My dad has more of a factory.

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:27.136
Not to brag,
but we're a pretty big shop.

00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:28.936
People need paper. They need
something to write on.

00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.656
They love the feel of that
card stock in their hands.

00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:31.680
Yeah.

00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:33.631
I've never heard
anyone say that.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:36.320
Hmm. We have not
found that at all.

00:53:36.480 --> 00:53:37.629
Yeah. Nope.

00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.416
I think we come from
two different worlds.

00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:40.475
Yes, we do.

00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.632
You better start learning code
pretty fucking fast, dude.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.074
Dude, Ned was crushing it

00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.794
since before you two were fighting
over your mother's titties.

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:49.720
Our mom
didn't breastfeed us.

00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:51.512
Laird, you know
we had a wet nurse.

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.680
Oh, I can tell.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.176
Boy, I'll tell you,
I don't know what's going on.

00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:56.200
I'm lost.

00:53:56.320 --> 00:53:57.594
I'm overwhelmed.
Yeah! Me, too.

00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.637
There's bukkake
floating all around me.

00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:00.875
What?
Hm?

00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:02.155
What's bukkake?

00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:03.355
Oh, Laird told me.

00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:05.033
It means when
you're overwhelmed

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:06.360
and you got too much going on.

00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.198
Oh, my gosh.
Can't figure things out.

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.669
Then, I'm drowning in bukkake
at this point.

00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:11.976
Okay, I'm gonna be
real with you guys.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.080
It means jizz on your face.

00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.520
I'm sorry?

00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:17.033
Bukkake means
covered in jizz.

00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.394
Tons of jizz, ejaculate.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.959
Usually after a gangbang.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:21.348
Not as bad as it sounds.

00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:22.714
Yeah,
post-gangbang.

00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.633
Or during. Depends
if someone finishes early.

00:54:25.840 --> 00:54:26.909
What the heck?

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.216
I was trying to
protect you, dude.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:29.832
- Protect me?
- Fucking Justine.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:31.149
You mean embarrass me?

00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.656
It was a really
sensitive conversation.

00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:33.696
I didn't want
to start talking

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.816
about guys jerking off
on each other.

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.336
Why'd you tell me
it was overwhelming?

00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.509
Justine brought it up!

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.194
I hope this is an opportune
time to show a video.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:41.360
It's not.

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.674
- Oh, God!
- Yeah.

00:54:42.880 --> 00:54:44.518
Oh, and this
is a teaching moment.

00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:45.999
- Here's another.
- Oh, my God.

00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:47.336
- No. Scotty.
- Don't look at that.

00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.157
It's all good.
You don't have to see this.

00:54:49.320 --> 00:54:50.878
Is that you?

00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:55.395
No.

00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.828
Oh, my God.

00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.998
We alive right now, now

00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:11.039
Let's get hot right now

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:13.477
We don't give a damn
about money

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.913
We alive right now

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:17.311
All we do is party, party

00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.515
And get hot right now

00:55:24.720 --> 00:55:26.073
Are you okay?

00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.955
Yeah!

00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.553
Come on, Daddy.
You're okay!

00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.557
Okay, I just need to
take a breather. One...

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:35.594
Do it again...

00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.318
Lost my mind,
I'm a lose it again

00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.038
I love this kid.

00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:41.395
Oh, my God!

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.033
Rage, rage the night away

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:44.712
Forget about the money
I spent today

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:46.512
Rage, rage the night away

00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:49.398
DDT your ass.
I love you, dawg.

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:52.436
Forget about the money
I spent today

00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:11.235
Hi, Pops.

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:14.360
I just need some fresh air.
Can I come?

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.754
We've always been straight
with each other, haven't we?

00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:26.920
Yeah, of course.

00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:28.336
Okay, I need to
ask you a question.

00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:29.475
And I mean this honestly.

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.834
Okay. What?

00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.000
You're scaring me.

00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:33.149
No. It's just...

00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:35.360
What?

00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.634
Why Laird?

00:56:37.800 --> 00:56:39.153
I mean, come on.
Oh, my God.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:40.912
Why?
Dad.

00:56:41.120 --> 00:56:43.111
You are so smart
and you're beautiful.

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:45.475
You could be dating anyone.
Why?

00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:47.000
I don't get it.
You want the truth?

00:56:47.120 --> 00:56:48.269
Yes.

00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.631
He kind of reminds me of you.

00:56:52.160 --> 00:56:53.160
What?

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:55.469
Me?
Yes.

00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:57.398
Okay, I need you
to explain that one.

00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:58.480
How?

00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:01.154
You're both the most honest
and authentic men that I know.

00:57:01.320 --> 00:57:02.776
It comes out
in totally different ways.

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:03.800
Oh, well...

00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:05.313
Laird has literally no filter.

00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.034
I don't know that to be true.
Is that right?

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:09.713
Okay.
Sorry.

00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:11.836
Trying to help you out here.

00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:14.839
But I swear his heart
is always in the right place.

00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:19.352
He's a very good guy.

00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:21.833
And I love him.

00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:27.880
You love him?

00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.994
What?

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.233
I'm processing.

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.560
We had the...
Very funny, Dad.

00:57:40.360 --> 00:57:42.157
Okay. Okay.

00:57:42.920 --> 00:57:44.558
Just try to be cordial.

00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:45.755
I will. I'll try.

00:57:45.920 --> 00:57:47.592
Okay? I'll try.
Try to what?

00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.398
I'll try to just...

00:57:50.720 --> 00:57:55.032
...understand
that person better.

00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.720
Come here.

00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.755
Hey.

00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:13.720
Hi.

00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:16.712
Long night.
What are you doing?

00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:19.599
Just chilling.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.636
Barb, is that my shirt?

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.711
I don't know, is it?

00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.438
Want me to take it off?

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:29.114
Would you, please?
I only brought two dress shirts.

00:58:29.280 --> 00:58:30.554
I really don't feel
like ironing

00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:32.073
while I'm on this trip.

00:58:33.920 --> 00:58:35.558
I'm so exhausted.

00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.629
Oh, yeah.

00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:40.119
Take it off, baby.

00:58:40.280 --> 00:58:43.716
Yeah! Take it off.
Take off those shoes, girl.

00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:47.156
Let me see those feet.
I wanna see those feet!

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.680
Did you hit your head
or something?

00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.109
Yeah. Let me
smell that shoe.

00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:52.256
You don't wanna
smell my shoe.

00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:53.280
Yeah, I want feet!

00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:55.436
I want those feet
out of those socks.

00:58:55.600 --> 00:58:56.919
Barb, what happened to you?

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.957
I am so stoned right now.

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.080
What?

00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.310
Yeah, I am so baked.

00:59:02.480 --> 00:59:04.277
I am like super baked.

00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:06.635
Barb. What?
Where did you?

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.439
I was very lonely
after you guys left.

00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:13.912
And I saw this guy,
and he had a cigarette.

00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.514
I thought it was one of those
electronic cigarettes.

00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:17.749
They're called E-cigs.

00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:18.840
Yeah.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.797
But turns out...

00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.791
I was vaping.

00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:23.995
What?

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:25.474
I was vaping.

00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.640
What is that?

00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:29.758
It's marijuana that comes
out of some kind of machine.

00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.632
Keep your voice down!
Ned, it's legal.

00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.633
Oh, this poor boy
had it for sleep apnea.

00:59:34.840 --> 00:59:37.638
At his age? So sad.
I'm going to bed. That's it.

00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.717
No, no, no. Wait!

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.136
- Barbara, I'm tired.
- Wait a minute.

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.160
And I've got a headache.

00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:44.311
Let's play a little bit, huh?
No, no.

00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:46.630
I'll give you
one of my patented massages.

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:48.119
Barb.
Let's take the Little Cheese

00:59:48.200 --> 00:59:49.315
out for a spin.
No, no, no.

00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:50.880
Come on, let me just see him.
Don't.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.616
I just want to see him.
Don't call him that.

00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.709
Please. Come on.

00:59:53.880 --> 00:59:54.915
Oh, my God!

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.560
You used to love getting high
and fooling around.

00:59:57.720 --> 00:59:59.119
What? Barb! No, Barb.

00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:01.016
We're on vacation!
But someone could walk...

01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.519
There's no locks
on the door!

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:03.680
What?

01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.559
Justine! Do you have any Kiss?

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:08.358
Oh, hell yeah!

01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:09.839
Are you kids gonna do it?
Yes.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.190
No.
We're doing it already.

01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.634
We're doing it right now.
Barb!

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.200
I'm doing it with my feet.
One foot.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:17.356
That's Kiss!
Honey, you love Kiss!

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:18.919
But not right now.

01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:25.349
Ned was made for loving Barb

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.555
Yell!

01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:32.958
Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:34.136
Look what I learned
at the party.

01:00:34.160 --> 01:00:35.160
What?

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.560
There was this real cute girl,
and she was going like this.

01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.032
She was doing this cute,
new dance.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.878
You're gonna
throw your back out.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.678
I'm not gonna throw my...

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:45.909
I'll throw you out.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.800
Let me get on you.
Wait, do you smell that?

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.432
I'm putting him in.
What is that scent?

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:50.749
There. Oh, it's in.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.552
What is that?
Oh, my God.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.755
Oh, my God!

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:58.918
Is that Indian Summer
by Priscilla Presley?

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.230
I used to wear
that perfume in the 90s.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.231
Yup, pumping some in.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.119
I saw you mentioned it on your
college reunion's Facebook page.

01:01:06.280 --> 01:01:07.918
I know what you like, Ned.

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:09.957
Oh, I know you do, dawg.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.350
Yeah, get in there. Get it!

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.039
Barb!
Get you some!

01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:15.952
Get it! Good. Oh, that's...
Okay.

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.599
Yeah. You're almost in there.

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.591
No, you're, like,
six inches away from it.

01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:22.035
Get in there.
Yeah, that's the spirit.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.753
Barb.
Oh! Yeah!

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:24.920
Barb!
That's good.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.911
Oh, that's good.
You're getting into it now.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.235
- That's it!
- No!

01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.470
No, no!
Take me! Yes! Take me!

01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:31.709
I'm not...
Take me.

01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.776
I'm taking you right to bed.
That's what I'm doing.

01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:35.074
Here you go. Yes.

01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:36.275
No, I wanna do sex.

01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.776
We are not gonna do sex.
No, honey.

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:38.915
But I want to.

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.376
Justine, turn all the music
off please...

01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:41.435
I wanna do it.

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.136
...and leave us alone
for the rest of the night.

01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.388
It's gonna be
full penetration!

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.788
Would you stop!

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.632
Psst... Hey, girl.

01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.639
Fifth button from the right.

01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.279
You'll thank me later.

There we go, girls.

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:31.440
Oh!

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.549
Okay. You all right?

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:35.233
Yeah. Oh, man.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.435
That's it.

01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:37.856
Dude, I thought
I was gonna make it.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.393
I know. You almost did, but...

01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.599
Very good evasive parkour.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.392
Yes, but the last move
you ate shit.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:44.675
I know.

01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.096
I'll put you
on the table later

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.400
and we'll do
a little adjustment.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:01.593
Ah!

01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:05.436
Christmas tree shopping
with the Big Cheese.

01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:07.750
Ned, you don't know
how excited I am about this.

01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:09.876
I don't know
if I ever mentioned this,

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.200
but I never had a father
to do this kind of stuff with.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.589
I'm glad we're getting
a chance to hang out.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.635
That's nice.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:19.751
Uh, it's not getting me hard.

01:04:20.720 --> 01:04:23.075
You need an erection
to buy a Christmas tree?

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:24.640
Helps.

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:27.953
I wanna get to
know you better.

01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:29.439
I mean, you're so perfect.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:32.353
Seriously, did you always
have your shit together?

01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:33.440
Oh, heck no.

01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:35.312
I got fired selling Datsuns.

01:04:37.400 --> 01:04:39.789
How'd you fuck up
selling little dogs?

01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.951
No. Datsuns.

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.675
What's that?

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.909
It's a car. Doesn't matter.

01:04:46.080 --> 01:04:47.354
It doesn't exist anymore.

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:48.999
But you're still here.

01:04:50.680 --> 01:04:53.831
You ever get nervous
about shifting tides?

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.629
Well, you know, every business
has its ups and downs.

01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:59.358
Yeah, I know it, bro.

01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:01.988
Guerrilla Gang, it's been
struggling a little bit.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.153
Really?

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.595
Yeah, it's just a fucking
tough landscape, dude.

01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.510
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.472
Whoa.

01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.668
Chills. Did you
come up with that?

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.159
No, Laird.

01:05:21.320 --> 01:05:22.320
Whoa, whoa.

01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.039
There she blows, Ned.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:27.198
It's our motherfucking tree.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.630
Why not? It'll look great
opposite your moose.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:32.396
Ned, Ned. Not that one.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:34.994
That one.

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:39.958
Oh, no. See, Laird...

01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.513
that doesn't belong
to this lot.

01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:42.680
See, it's owned by...

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.671
Wet games?
Wewt Games.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.068
Like, 'woot-woot'.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:47.633
I know those dudes.
They're dicks.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.392
Tried to rip off
Ape Assassins.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.835
Plus, it's the first Christmas
with the family, dude.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Gotta do it right.

01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:54.160
Hey, buddy.

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:55.200
Yeah.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.673
Can I borrow that chainsaw?

01:05:56.840 --> 01:05:57.875
Are you serious?

01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.520
Yeah.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:02.191
Fucking...

01:06:02.920 --> 01:06:04.035
Come on.

01:06:05.720 --> 01:06:06.869
Will you hurry up?

01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:08.553
I'm trying.

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.029
Come on, guy.
I need my chainsaw back.

01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.553
Just give me a second.

01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:13.960
Should we call
an ambulance now,

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.393
or wait till
he loses a finger?

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.549
Can I borrow those?

01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.669
Have at it.

01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:22.759
Okay. Laird just...

01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.989
Okay.

01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:25.080
Hand it over?

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.235
You sure, Ned?
Yup.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.518
Oh!

01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:35.917
Total fucking Dad move!

01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:51.789
Oh, shit!

01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:54.480
You keep on dancing
and the room gets hot

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:58.311
You drive us wild,
we'll drive you crazy

01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.392
I wanna rock and roll
all night...

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.232
Love Kiss!

01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.279
Kiss, baby!

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:12.839
These guys are awesome!

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.639
Stephanie and I do karaoke
to Kiss all the time.

01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.796
Dude, I know,
that's why I put it on!

01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.791
And we do
a pretty good job, too,

01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.109
if I might say so.
Oh, man.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.232
That's cute.
Yeah.

01:07:25.080 --> 01:07:27.594
Listen, Laird,
I've been thinking about

01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:29.272
our teepee talk yesterday.

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:30.959
Oh, dude, me too.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:32.951
I've got so many ideas
for the proposal.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:34.951
No.
No. Ned, hear me out.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:37.315
I was thinking about
getting the Goodyear blimp,

01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:38.560
releasing a thousand doves.

01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:39.675
No. Wait.

01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:41.200
Laird, just hold on
a second, okay?

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.320
Slow down.
Okay.

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:46.110
Look, I get it that Stephanie
really likes you.

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:47.280
But...
Uh-huh.

01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:49.638
Look. Man to man.
Yeah.

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.360
Now is not the time.

01:07:52.520 --> 01:07:55.592
Dude, Ned, I thought we were
getting past all that.

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.153
No, it's not me.

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:58.469
It's all about Stephanie.

01:07:58.640 --> 01:07:59.709
Stephanie?
Yes.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.840
I don't know, dude.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.992
These last few semesters
are gonna be so intense.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:05.639
And then there's graduation,

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:06.994
and she'll be
looking for a job.

01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.680
And who knows
where that will take her.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.353
It's just...
All right, Ned...

01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:11.816
I wasn't supposed to
tell you this,

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.558
but I just wanna
put your mind at ease.

01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:18.153
Stephanie is not going back
to school next semester.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:20.840
What?

01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:24.949
Dude, I know you're probably
shocked, but do not worry.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:26.832
She's already
got this awesome job

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:28.512
lined up
at this non-profit.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:32.035
What organization
is that exactly?

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.869
She's going to be president of
the Laird Mayhew Foundation.

01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.239
That's me.

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.189
Stephanie!

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.360
Barb?

01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.074
Everybody upstairs right now,
family meeting!

01:08:50.320 --> 01:08:51.896
Ned, would you like
me to schedule a meeting?

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:52.955
Oh, fuck off!

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:54.040
Just trying to help.

01:08:54.080 --> 01:08:55.576
You don't always have to be
such an asshole.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:56.828
Yes, I do!

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.391
Dad.
You are so dead.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.994
Shut up. Of course
I was going to tell you.

01:09:02.200 --> 01:09:03.679
I told Mom yesterday
at the mall.

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.856
I was just waiting for
the right time to bring it up

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:07.216
and that hasn't happened.
Wait a minute.

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:08.240
You knew?

01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:12.399
Honestly, honey, we thought
you might freak out.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.437
So we decided to wait until

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.755
after Christmas
to bring it up.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.960
But, okay, he told you
about the foundation, right?

01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.872
Yes.
Yes, okay.

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:22.376
This is a big part of
why I wanted you

01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.436
to come out here
and meet Laird.

01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:28.949
Stephanie, even if he wasn't
this abject lunatic,

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.235
which he is,

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.278
I still wouldn't
understand why.

01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:34.959
You've only got
a few semesters left

01:09:35.080 --> 01:09:36.195
before you graduate.

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.072
Why would you
just throw that away?

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.576
I'm not throwing
anything away, Dad.

01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:40.736
The year I spent
in Central America

01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:42.079
doing this kind of work,

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.430
I know you think that I'm
making some rash decision

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:47.600
and I'm not.

01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:50.115
We've spent months
figuring it out.

01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:51.508
All the months

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.716
where you didn't even tell us
you had a boyfriend.

01:09:53.880 --> 01:09:54.880
All those months?

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.753
Darling...

01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.439
I think you should
hear her out

01:09:58.600 --> 01:10:00.955
because it actually sounds
very interesting.

01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:02.080
Does it?

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:04.111
Are you
willing to listen to me?

01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:05.280
Give it your best shot.

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:08.793
The plan is to focus
on women's health

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.776
as a function of environmental
change in the Third World.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:11.800
Right.
All right.

01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:12.976
And when all that
goes belly-up,

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.200
you know what
you're left with?

01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:16.276
What?
Being a college dropout.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.959
That's it.
You don't get it.

01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:19.120
Oh, I don't get it?

01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.952
No, you just, like,
don't get it at all.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:22.799
Oh. What is that?

01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:25.429
It's a tattoo.

01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:26.953
With his name?
You got a tattoo?

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:29.116
You've marked your body
with his name on it.

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:30.349
Look at that, Barb!

01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:31.953
Oh, no.

01:10:32.160 --> 01:10:33.832
That is so cute.

01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.280
Let me see.
I wanna see.

01:10:35.320 --> 01:10:37.200
Laird's been telling me
I should get a neck tat.

01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.588
I see what
Laird is doing here.

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:40.600
I see what he's doing.

01:10:40.760 --> 01:10:44.150
He is trying to put his
imprint on this entire family.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:47.437
And that is why we've got
all these secrets now.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.999
And it's all because of him!

01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.037
Why do you have such
a big problem with Laird?

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:53.031
Great question.
You know why? Why?

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:55.156
Because of his influence,

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.673
you drop out of college.

01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:59.035
Because of his influence,
you get a "too."

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:00.320
Dad, I think you mean "tat."

01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.440
You definitely mean "tat."

01:11:01.480 --> 01:11:02.616
I mean "tat?"
It's not a "too?"

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.776
"Tat." No, it's not a "too."
No.

01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:05.313
No, I saw it on Geraldo.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:07.232
They call them "toos," okay?
Okay.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.470
This is what's going to be
your downward spiral.

01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.232
First you get a tattoo,

01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:12.992
then you start vaporizing.

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.792
- What?
- You're vaporizing.

01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.518
What are you talking about?

01:11:16.680 --> 01:11:19.638
When you have...
It's an e-cigarette.

01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:22.473
But instead of tobacco
or a fake tobacco,

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:24.358
no, you have marijuana
in that e-cigarette.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.748
Dad, I know what it is.
Yeah.

01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.319
How do you know
what it is?

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:30.358
Because I've been around.
Haven't I?

01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:33.195
Mm-hmm.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.952
Then you go
from there to heroin.

01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.075
Mm-hmm, that's right.

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.470
After that, after you
get hooked on drugs,

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.640
you know what happens next?

01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:40.720
What?

01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:41.856
You'll become a hooker,
a prostitute...

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:42.995
a pimp's bitch.

01:11:43.080 --> 01:11:44.752
That's what's
going to happen to you.

01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:46.194
I see it very clearly.

01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.868
Oh, my...
How long do I have?

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.917
I'm glad you asked.
Not long.

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:54.231
You keep going down this path,
at this rate, not long.

01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.868
You're clearly not in a place
to listen to me right now.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080
So I'm gonna go.

01:11:58.240 --> 01:11:59.560
Thank you, Pops,
for the guidance.

01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:00.914
Thank you.
You're welcome.

01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:49.438
When the line froze,
what did I see?

01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.115
A bad mother fucker
standing next to me

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.435
Boom!

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:59.949
Be free like a bird
so today I'ma fly

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.588
Bad, bad motherfucker
'til the day I die

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.592
Boss, let me
get this straight.

01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.875
You want me
to hack into

01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:08.791
Stephanie's
boyfriend's computer

01:13:08.960 --> 01:13:10.552
and find out
if there's any record

01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.119
of him starting a foundation?

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.320
Yes, I do.

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:15.391
Listen, Kevin,
you are my IT guy.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:16.680
I've got nowhere else to turn.

01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:19.149
You know I've always thought
so highly of Stephanie.

01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:21.629
Yeah, she thinks
a lot about you.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:23.677
Really? Oh, yeah.

01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:25.637
That's so crazy.
Now, listen.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.176
I know that this character
has money,

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.120
but there's something about
this whole foundation

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:30.480
that sounds like
a bunch of hooey.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:34.030
If this guy's running hooey,
then I'm gonna find out.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.400
Okay,
first thing's first, Ned,

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.038
you have to break into
his computer

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:39.839
and download a program
that I'm gonna send you.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.319
That's hacking?

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:45.990
I took a shower,
washing every body part...

01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:49.357
Yeah, okay.
I'm getting online.

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.991
Kevin, what are you doing?
Huh, baby?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.390
Oh, I'm helping Ned
with something IT-related.

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.834
Oh, tell Ned I said hi.

01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Okay.

01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.080
All right, webcam's on.

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.760
Okay, I'm in the office.

01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.836
All right, now get
in front of the computer.

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.918
All right, good.
Press the spacebar.

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.351
Oh, darn.
It's asking for a password.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.480
No surprise.

01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:16.195
A lot of guys have passwords related
to their girlfriends or their wives.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.878
Kevin, you're a genius.
That's what I have!

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:22.873
It's "Barbsguy1989."
The year we were married.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.348
The younger generation tends
to go a little bit racier.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:28.320
I'm gonna get into some
sensitive areas here,

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.719
so just bear with me.

01:14:29.880 --> 01:14:33.270
We need to focus on Stephanie's
more defining qualities

01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:35.078
that this guy
might latch onto.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.600
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.392
Would you just get to it?

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:40.391
For example, like,
would you say...

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.516
Stephanie has perky breasts?

01:14:44.240 --> 01:14:45.389
What?
Okay.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:47.198
I would say yes,
because she does.

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.874
Please try "Stephanie's boobs"
one word, no caps.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.075
I'm her dad!

01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:52.912
I understand that
you're her dad,

01:14:53.080 --> 01:14:54.672
but you gotta think like him.

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:55.915
Okay?

01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.760
No.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.438
We're gonna have to
kick it up a notch.

01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.278
You said that
this guy was edgy?

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:09.434
Please try
"Stephanie's tight ass."

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.595
Give that a whirl.

01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.631
Are you messing with me,
Dingle?

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:15.711
I wish I was messing with you.

01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:17.074
I'm trying to help you, Ned.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.475
Make the two "S's"
dollar signs in "ass."

01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:20.755
God!

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:23.275
I am going straight to hell
just for typing this.

01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.112
Tight ass.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.878
No.
Hey, guys?

01:15:28.080 --> 01:15:29.760
Do you wanna raise the volume
on the movie?

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:30.800
Okay.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.719
Okay. I'm just gonna list
some off, you type them in.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.430
All right,
try "Stephanie's sweet slit."

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:38.591
I am not writing that!

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.472
Okay,
"Stephanie's pink canoe."

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.680
No!

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.080
Listen, this isn't fun for me.

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.599
Oh, my God.
What is it?

01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:50.159
It's the password!

01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:52.356
The one piece of paper
in the entire house.

01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:53.936
What does it say?
I'm gonna log it in.

01:15:53.960 --> 01:15:56.110
"Stephanie's dude."

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.197
Aw, that's actually sweet.

01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.509
"2016."

01:16:00.680 --> 01:16:01.680
Boom! We're in.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840
Oh, gosh!

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.149
What? What is it?

01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:06.276
It's a nude photograph
of Stephanie.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.998
May I see it, please?
No.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.160
May I please see it?

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:10.753
I said no!
Okay.

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.840
Go to your EarthLink account
in the web browser.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:15.634
EarthLink, EarthLink, okay.
Press.

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:17.309
I give it my password.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.675
Okay.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:20.952
Okay.
I just emailed you a file.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.951
Download that and
open it on his desktop.

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:25.870
Ned, we're gonna fucking nail this guy!
We're good!

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.513
We're hacking, baby!

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.874
We're gonna nail him.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.280
We're gonna nail him the way
he's been nailing Stephanie.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.536
Just come with me right now.

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.560
What?

01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:34.696
Why are you
taking me to my office?

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:35.755
Everyone's downstairs.

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.478
Oh, shit! Someone's coming!
Okay. Escape!

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.595
Oh, God!

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:39.880
Baby,
what are we doing?

01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.313
Christmas Eve
is about to start.

01:16:41.480 --> 01:16:43.280
What is the matter with you?
What's happening?

01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:44.816
I specifically told you...
Don't say anything.

01:16:44.840 --> 01:16:48.196
that I wanted to be the one to
tell my dad about Stanford.

01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.200
I know. We were just...
Then why did you do it?

01:16:50.360 --> 01:16:52.669
We were bonding so hard,
it just sort of slipped out.

01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:55.638
You clearly have no
idea what this means to him.

01:16:55.840 --> 01:16:58.229
He was so proud of me
when I got into Stanford.

01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.359
He worked so hard
to make it happen.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:06.035
Me dropping out is like
a huge slap in his face.

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:07.920
Okay.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.235
I just never had anyone
like him in my life before.

01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:11.879
Oh, my God!

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.511
I thought we could
just talk it out.

01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:17.240
You could see how that's not
your place to do that, right?

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.509
Okay. Maybe not.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:19.829
Definitely not.

01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:22.355
Okay, you're right.
He was super pissed.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:26.431
Sometimes I feel like
you're not capable

01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.238
of being in a relationship.

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.675
It's time that
you get a handle

01:17:30.760 --> 01:17:32.600
on these father issues.

01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.715
Wow.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.393
That's the truth.

01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:38.435
When you call me
on my shit...

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.434
My God! It makes me
feel so close to you.

01:17:42.600 --> 01:17:45.797
Your honesty has
such an effect on me.

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.435
You're making me so
fucking horny right now.

01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.949
- What?
- Yeah.

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.598
That face is boner-bait.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:54.600
Can you not see
that I'm mad at you?

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.176
Yeah, I see it.
That's what's...

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:57.856
Oh, my God.
You're driving me crazy!

01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.711
You're not listening to me.

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:01.640
I'm listening.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.554
I'm sorry.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.789
Do you...

01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.639
You need therapy.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.308
Not working.
No?

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.754
Mm-mm. Not today, buddy.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.319
Okay. How about this?

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.075
Is this working?

01:18:19.280 --> 01:18:20.554
A little bit.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:22.429
Okay, how about this?

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:28.676
Okay. That's working
a little bit more.

01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.398
Laird,
I love you.

01:18:30.600 --> 01:18:31.919
But I'm still
mad at you.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.433
I'm sorry.

01:18:42.960 --> 01:18:44.678
I'm so sorry.
No, no!

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.120
Okay?

01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:47.360
Yes!

01:18:47.480 --> 01:18:48.480
No!

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.480
You...

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.016
I'm gonna make it up to you.
What is happening?

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:57.560
You just lie back, and I'll give you
an early Christmas present.

01:18:57.600 --> 01:18:59.636
You are
such a freak.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:00.949
I know.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:05.875
Here comes Santa.

01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.040
Oh, really?

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.151
Ho, ho, ho.
Oh, my God.

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.514
Merry Christmas.

01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:14.313
Somebody's been
naughty this year.

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:17.835
Boss?

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:20.195
Ned. Are you there? Hello?

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320
Hello?
Oh.

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:23.994
Yes. Kevin, I'm here.
What's happening?

01:19:24.120 --> 01:19:25.120
I'm in.

01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:26.680
Do you have access
to the Internet?

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.199
Yes, I do. Hold on.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:29.634
Wait a second.

01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:31.392
Log into your
EarthLink account.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:33.480
Okay. Got it.

01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.677
I'm gonna send these
to you right now.

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:38.796
Good.
You're done, Mayhew.

01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.355
What the fuck?

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:43.832
What happened?
Oh, my God.

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.319
Wait, what?
What's going on?

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:47.630
I don't know. He has my face.

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:48.856
What do you mean
he has your face?

01:19:48.880 --> 01:19:49.880
I'm locked out.

01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:51.353
I can't use
my computer anymore.

01:19:51.480 --> 01:19:52.480
What?
Stop that!

01:19:52.600 --> 01:19:54.000
What's happening?
He's onto us, Ned.

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.040
What are you doing?

01:19:55.200 --> 01:19:57.760
We have to abort.
Oh, God. Oh, no.

01:19:57.920 --> 01:20:01.071
Move back, motherfuckers
Mayhew's here

01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:02.200
Oh, fuck!

01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.440
He's a mythical creature, Ned.

01:20:03.520 --> 01:20:04.520
He's what?

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:08.073
What the fuck? Oh, God.

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.077
He's pulling out his penis!

01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:12.433
Oh, my God.

01:20:12.600 --> 01:20:14.511
He's balls deep
in my digital butt.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:18.216
Are you watching porn?

01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:19.355
Turn that off!

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:20.589
Ned, he's doing it!

01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:22.553
Marnie, it's not good!

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.558
Stay the fuck out!
Turn that off!

01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:25.755
Kevin!

01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920
Kevin!

01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:32.239
He has control of the house!

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:33.435
Come here!

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.376
Kevin, what is happening?
We gotta get out of here!

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.400
Go, go, go!

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.600
- What?
- Kevin!

01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.079
Kevin!

01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.876
Oh, my...

01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:57.639
Silent night

01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:01.509
Holy night

01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.676
All is calm

01:21:07.040 --> 01:21:09.508
All is bright

01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:13.468
Hi.
Hey.

01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:14.999
You know what?
Let's not fight.

01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:16.115
Okay.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.680
I'm sorry, truly, that you found out
about Stanford that way.

01:21:18.760 --> 01:21:19.760
Thank you.

01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.720
It was not okay of Laird,
and he knows that now.

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:23.256
But I'm confident
this is a really good idea.

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.936
Honey, before you continue,
I need to tell you something.

01:21:24.960 --> 01:21:27.599
Laird has been lying to you.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.160
I tried.

01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:30.759
No, no, no. Hey!
It's unbelievable!

01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.797
He is in serious
financial trouble.

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:34.757
In what way?
It's Christmas.

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:36.148
Ned, you're making a mistake.

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.595
He doesn't have enough money
to finance his business,

01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.079
let alone a foundation.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:41.856
What exactly
makes you think that?

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:43.199
Wait till you see this.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:44.475
What's this?
Here.

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:46.551
Look at this,
his own bank records.

01:21:46.720 --> 01:21:48.233
All in red.

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:51.349
Is this for real?

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:52.589
Yeah, it's true.

01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:55.360
Guerrilla Gang hasn't crushed
one in a couple of years.

01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.078
So you lied to me?

01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:58.434
I'm dropping out of school

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:00.960
to start a foundation that
you're supposed to be financing.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.109
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:22:02.280 --> 01:22:04.350
Baby, the foundation
is all good.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.278
What are you talking about?

01:22:06.480 --> 01:22:09.790
Ned, there has been
a very big misunderstanding.

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.918
These are only
Laird's business holdings.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.080
On the personal side...

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.376
I have put together
a moderate,

01:22:15.400 --> 01:22:17.231
conservative private
equity sleeve

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:19.277
that has been
performing delightfully.

01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:21.032
You could say that again.
Mm-hmm.

01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:22.599
So you followed
the Buffett rule?

01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:23.880
Always, dude.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.752
70/30, stocks to bonds.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:26.840
Buffet.

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:27.960
Nice.

01:22:28.040 --> 01:22:29.136
Your little hacker, Dingle...

01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.160
Hacker?

01:22:30.320 --> 01:22:31.992
...was worming down
the wrong hole.

01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:34.549
- Does he mean Kevin Dingle?
- Probably.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.079
No, must be another Dingle.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.674
Only dingle I know of
is the berries on the butt.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:40.637
Look, how much money
do you have?

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:41.816
Babe, you don't
have to answer this.

01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:42.909
Yes, he does.

01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:44.797
Fine! Full disclosure.

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.154
It's bad.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:50.078
I'm down to
my last 97 million.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.918
Laird.

01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:55.271
197 million.

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:57.875
Boom.

01:22:57.960 --> 01:23:00.155
He's just barely scraping by.

01:23:00.320 --> 01:23:01.480
All you had to do was ask me.

01:23:01.600 --> 01:23:03.636
Gentlemen, I need
Deck the Halls, allegro, now.

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.873
Deck the halls
with boughs of holly

01:23:07.080 --> 01:23:08.672
Ned, it's the holidays

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:10.478
and I think
we should start over.

01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:13.189
So this is for you.

01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.320
What is it?

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:19.600
It's a little
stocking stuffer.

01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:20.749
I think you'll like it.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.152
A phone?
Press the button.

01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.914
This is from my bank
in Grand Rapids.

01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.195
Merry Christmas.

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.416
Someone fill me in here.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:32.440
Well, Steph...

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:35.074
I bought
your father's company.

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:36.795
Sort of.

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.714
Ned, I purchased all your debt
as a Christmas present.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.199
What the fuck?

01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.517
You son of a bitch.
What?

01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.920
Dude, I'm trying to be nice,
so you can avoid bankruptcy.

01:23:47.440 --> 01:23:48.759
Are you guys
talking Chapter 11?

01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.160
I don't even wanna
hear that term.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:52.959
Okay, gentlemen,
I need Jingle Bells, and step on it!

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:56.317
I can't believe that
you didn't tell us about this.

01:23:56.480 --> 01:23:58.550
What? No, it's just...

01:23:58.760 --> 01:24:01.228
The business has been running
a little rough lately.

01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.096
I'm already working on
a new deal right now.

01:24:03.120 --> 01:24:05.031
So you had no idea?
No.

01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.640
How the hell
did you know about this?

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:08.797
It was Justine.
Oh.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:10.074
Yeah, it was me.

01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.976
She played me back a little bit of a
conversation you had the other day...

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:14.000
with a guy named Lou.

01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:16.636
Of course,
I had to help.

01:24:16.800 --> 01:24:18.376
Ned,
I'm sorry if I overstepped.

01:24:18.400 --> 01:24:19.400
Yep.

01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:21.516
But I was really,
really worried about you.

01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:23.272
She was.
No clowning.

01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.953
And just so
you don't stress,

01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:27.469
you're still gonna be
the Big Cheese, dude.

01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.551
I plan on being
a very hands-off owner.

01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:33.108
So what do you say, partner?

01:24:35.680 --> 01:24:37.320
- Ned, what are you...
- What the fuck?

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.357
Why would you do that, Dad?

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.440
Dad!

01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.919
Fuck you, paper man!

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.959
Oh, scheisse.

01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.120
Ned, I'm sorry, bro.

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:47.872
Are you okay? Oh, man.

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:49.314
My training,
it just takes over.

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.715
Everybody is feeling
a lot of tension.

01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:52.949
Calm down.
Dad!

01:24:53.960 --> 01:24:56.394
Or we can hit people square
in the face with an iPad.

01:24:58.400 --> 01:25:00.072
Disengage.
Disengage and run!

01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:05.336
Dude, that was kind of cool.
You gotta be honest.

01:25:05.360 --> 01:25:07.237
Ned, I love you.
I was just trying to help.

01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.800
Ooh!

01:25:11.560 --> 01:25:12.560
Laird, disengage him!

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.153
Ned, let go of his balls!

01:25:17.640 --> 01:25:19.358
Laird! Evasive parkour!

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:20.589
Laird, get away!

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:22.711
Evasive parkour!
Do the wall pop!

01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:24.560
Wall pop!

01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.758
Goose! Did you see that?

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:32.639
That's right! Because you
finally engaged your core!

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:33.800
Get down here!

01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.696
You see the difference of the feeling?
How it feels differently?

01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:37.755
I know!

01:25:38.720 --> 01:25:39.835
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

01:25:40.440 --> 01:25:41.736
Don't breathe in.
I'll save you, brother!

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.840
Scotty, no! Scotty!

01:25:42.880 --> 01:25:43.880
No, honey!

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:45.920
I'm here to save you, Laird!

01:25:50.600 --> 01:25:51.669
Scotty, watch out!

01:26:00.080 --> 01:26:01.877
Laird! You okay?

01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:04.040
Yeah!

01:26:04.200 --> 01:26:05.474
Fantastic!
You're okay.

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.678
You're okay.
Wait. Where's Scotty?

01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.114
Scotty! Oh, my God.

01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.357
Scotty!
He's under the moose!

01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.976
He's under the moose!

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:14.149
Scotty!

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:17.240
Oh, shit.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:19.670
These fucking moose balls
are in my mouth.

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:21.876
Oh, shit,
he's teabagging you, bro!

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.359
I got you.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:31.189
Come here. Come here.

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:33.032
Oh, my God. It's okay.

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.200
It's okay.

01:26:37.680 --> 01:26:39.989
Honey, I'm so sorry
it turned out this way.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:41.160
Me, too.

01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.000
I'll call you
when I get home.

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:45.111
Okay. Good luck with Scotty.

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:47.359
Thank you. I'll need it.
Yeah.

01:26:49.440 --> 01:26:52.079
Steph, listen. I never...

01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:54.435
I'm done listening.
Have a safe flight.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:59.632
See you, sis.
Bye, Scotty.

01:27:01.560 --> 01:27:03.949
Can't believe I have to
go back to toilet paper.

01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.433
Hey, Don Millis.
Merry Christmas, sir.

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.400
You too, Ned. Look, I hate
to call on Christmas.

01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.238
Oh, don't worry about that.

01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:19.152
It was great
catching up yesterday

01:27:19.320 --> 01:27:21.480
and I wanted to ring you
as soon as we made a decision.

01:27:21.560 --> 01:27:22.560
Okay.

01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:24.520
I talked with the group here
about your proposal

01:27:24.600 --> 01:27:26.192
and we just can't go for it.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:27.634
I'm sorry, pal.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:30.513
We really appreciate you offering
us such a sweetheart deal.

01:27:30.720 --> 01:27:33.296
But fact is we 're just not doing a
whole lot of printing these days.

01:27:33.320 --> 01:27:34.469
You know how it is.
Yes.

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:35.776
It's a whole new world, right?

01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:36.800
Yes.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:38.755
Sure is.

01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:40.720
I sure wish we could've
done business, Cheese.

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.159
All right, listen, um,

01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:44.715
if you're sure I can't
change your mind there, Don.

01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:46.108
Yeah, unfortunately not.

01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:47.992
Okay. All right.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.236
You have a happy holidays.
You, too, Ned!

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:52.799
Best to Barb and the kids.

01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:57.239
Excuse me, Ned?

01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:00.358
I'm sorry to bother you,
but your flight leaves in an hour.

01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.676
Must seem strange
to you, my friend

01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:08.239
I'll miss you.

01:28:08.320 --> 01:28:11.630
Some things are always
heaven sent

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:16.189
The more you want,
the harder it gets

01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.872
The more you let go,
the more you get

01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:22.439
It's a crazy...

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.032
...beautiful life

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:34.793
Some things make sense
and you don't know what

01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:39.391
It's a crazy beautiful life

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.311
Welcome home, Flemings!

01:28:48.480 --> 01:28:49.595
Lou, what...

01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:50.789
You guys must be freezing.

01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:53.155
Come on, get in here.
Let me get that. Come on, Cheese.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:54.600
Lou, what's going on?
Barbara, hey.

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.835
Hi.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.016
- Barb, you look great.
- There they are!

01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.508
Merry Christmas!

01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.909
Wow!

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:06.830
Um, Lou, I texted you that
I needed to talk to you.

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:08.000
I mean, what's...

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.151
Come on,
you hear this guy?

01:29:10.360 --> 01:29:11.759
Hank Rouse
from First National

01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:14.309
shot me a congratulatory
voicemail this morning

01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.839
about the
Mayhew deal.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000
You did it,
Big Cheese!

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:20.040
You pulled off
the Christmas miracle.

01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:24.156
Cheese, Cheese, Cheese!
Cheese, Cheese, Cheese!

01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.435
Barb!

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:27.440
Scotty.

01:29:27.600 --> 01:29:30.319
Ned, as a little token
of our appreciation,

01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:32.948
we all chipped in
and bought you something

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.759
that we're pretty sure
you don't own.

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.872
You shouldn't have.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:41.553
Open it. Yeah.

01:29:42.280 --> 01:29:43.280
Yeah, right there.

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:46.790
It's an iPad.

01:29:47.960 --> 01:29:49.313
Hit the home button
right there.

01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:50.480
Yeah.

01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:53.856
We had a little fun
with that down in Graphics.

01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:56.030
I got the images off
Scotty's Facebook page.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.718
He looks like a stand-up guy.

01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.552
Like a younger version
of you, Ned.

01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:03.355
Make a speech!

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.799
Speech!
Oh, yes, speech!

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:06.319
Speech, speech, speech.

01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:13.074
The heck is that?

01:30:17.240 --> 01:30:19.515
Laird, a jet and
a helicopter? Where are we?

01:30:19.720 --> 01:30:21.199
Hang on, babe. Almost there.

01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.359
One second.
Mayhew!

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.536
Guys, stay here
for a minute.

01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.696
Honey, go inside
and get a jacket.

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:37.896
That's Mayhew.
Is that the guy?

01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:38.920
Laird!

01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.194
Where are we?

01:30:40.360 --> 01:30:41.360
That looks weird.

01:30:41.440 --> 01:30:42.920
It's kind of Fifty
Shades of Grey-ish.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:44.712
Cold?
Yeah.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:49.508
And here we go.

01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.594
Surprise!

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:54.675
Hi, honey.

01:30:56.080 --> 01:30:57.195
Ta-da.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.278
You brought me home?
Yeah.

01:31:01.440 --> 01:31:03.078
Without telling me?

01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.550
I realize I violated the
sanctity of mystery date

01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.598
but I just thought the family
should all be together today.

01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.520
Okay, that wasn't your
place to do that, hon.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.471
Steph, I know,

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.039
but it is Christmas.

01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.275
And we're glad
to see you.

01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:17.509
This isn't what
she wanted.

01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.669
No, it's not.

01:31:18.760 --> 01:31:20.318
What I wanted was
for us to spend

01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.799
Christmas in
California together

01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:24.394
like I planned, before
everything went to shit

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.312
because you made it
all about yourself.

01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:28.469
Mm-hmm.

01:31:29.160 --> 01:31:30.388
You both did.

01:31:30.560 --> 01:31:31.754
I did?
Yes!

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.918
You idiots think you can
pass me back and forth

01:31:35.080 --> 01:31:36.911
like I'm your property
or something?

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:38.000
I'm done.

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:39.559
This is the worst
Christmas ever.

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.432
Steph.
Steph. Honey.

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:47.594
I think she's pissed.

01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:52.351
Yeah, she's pissed.

01:31:52.480 --> 01:31:53.480
Shit!

01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:57.753
I just thought that you guys
should be together today.

01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:01.355
All right.
Well, I'll leave you to it.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.633
Happy holidays, Ned.

01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.119
You too, Laird.

01:32:12.280 --> 01:32:13.759
Uh, Laird.

01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.951
You're doing a "I'm
gonna walk away slowly

01:32:16.040 --> 01:32:17.640
"'cause I really don't
wanna leave" walk.

01:32:19.840 --> 01:32:21.193
Maybe.

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:22.640
Come here.

01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.949
Come here.

01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:26.997
So what happened?
You didn't propose?

01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:28.275
How could I?

01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:29.520
I never got
your permission

01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:31.471
and we pinky-swore
I wouldn't ask without it.

01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:35.358
You are remarkable.

01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:39.876
You don't have a gear
to be dishonest, do you?

01:32:40.640 --> 01:32:42.039
Guess not, dude.

01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:46.712
Laird, you never needed
my permission

01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.199
to ask Stephanie
to marry you.

01:32:49.880 --> 01:32:52.030
But if it still means
anything to you,

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.549
you have my blessing.

01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.355
For reals?

01:32:58.920 --> 01:32:59.920
No clowning.

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.520
Whoa.

01:33:04.320 --> 01:33:06.709
But, Laird,
Stephanie's right.

01:33:06.880 --> 01:33:09.155
It's up to her.
It's always been up to her.

01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.309
Not us.

01:33:11.680 --> 01:33:14.240
It just took me a while
to realize that.

01:33:15.680 --> 01:33:16.715
It's so true.

01:33:17.680 --> 01:33:19.159
Dude, we were such jerks.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.509
Yeah.

01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:21.874
I bit your dick.

01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:24.672
Shaft and balls.
Oh.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:27.668
I'm sorry.

01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:29.918
I'm sorry, too, dude.

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:33.192
Look, Laird, if you wanna
ask Stephanie to marry you

01:33:33.360 --> 01:33:35.396
when the time
is right, just do it.

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:39.030
Okay. Is it cool
if I do it right now?

01:33:39.200 --> 01:33:41.430
Because, uh, just in case
it worked out

01:33:41.600 --> 01:33:44.717
I had Goose put a shit ton
of doves in the helicopter

01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:46.280
and I have
a couple other surprises.

01:33:46.440 --> 01:33:48.874
Laird, this is
totally your call.

01:33:49.040 --> 01:33:51.031
But can I give you
some advice?

01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:52.629
Dude, please.

01:33:52.720 --> 01:33:53.776
I'm so fucking
nervous right now.

01:33:53.800 --> 01:33:54.835
All right, look...

01:33:54.920 --> 01:33:58.196
Stephanie doesn't care about
all the bells and whistles.

01:33:58.400 --> 01:33:59.958
You know her.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.553
She cares about you.

01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.073
She loves you.

01:34:04.560 --> 01:34:06.437
So you get down
on one knee

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.709
and you speak to her
from your heart.

01:34:10.600 --> 01:34:12.238
That's what
you're best at.

01:34:14.160 --> 01:34:16.390
Isn't that right,
Justine?

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:18.399
Totally agree.

01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:19.960
Holy shit.

01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:23.233
My first time in Michigan.
It's cold as balls here.

01:34:24.400 --> 01:34:25.400
Yeah.

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.795
Dude, that's
fucking great!

01:34:28.600 --> 01:34:29.749
Do it Ned Fleming style.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.478
Old school!

01:34:31.680 --> 01:34:32.749
Fuck yes.

01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.638
Okay. Well, look...

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.816
I'll go in there and see if
I can get her to come out.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:39.840
Okay.

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.632
Good luck.
Thanks.

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.156
Hey, promise me
one thing.

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:49.952
You will treat
her well.

01:34:51.520 --> 01:34:54.478
Dude, I'm gonna treat her
like a motherfucking queen.

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:57.514
I'll take that.

01:34:57.680 --> 01:34:58.680
Okay.

01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:02.790
Gustav, change of plans.

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:05.554
We're go on the proposal.
No go on all that other shit.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:06.640
I have only one bar.

01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:08.199
You're saying
we are a go, yes?

01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:09.952
No. No go.

01:35:10.120 --> 01:35:12.111
Go on the proposal,
no go on the shit.

01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:14.191
Laird, are you saying
it's a no go

01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:16.476
or are you saying, "No. Go."?

01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.629
God damn it, Goose.

01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:19.656
You're making me fucking
nervous. Just shut up.

01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.272
Oh, I'm sorry. Good luck.

01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:23.789
Oh, and by the way,
please, Laird, breathe.

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:27.755
Okay.

01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.831
And no cursing, okay?

01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:31.513
Fuck, you're right. Good call.

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:34.755
Hi.

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.153
I'm sorry.

01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:43.315
I know that out in California
I disappointed you

01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.357
and that kills me.

01:35:45.520 --> 01:35:47.158
And I'm really sorry.

01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:51.680
I'm sorry, too.

01:35:53.720 --> 01:35:54.976
I threw you in the
deep end out there.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.400
I should've never
asked you to come.

01:35:56.520 --> 01:35:57.520
Honestly. No.

01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.079
No, you didn't do
anything wrong.

01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:00.389
What was I thinking?

01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:01.675
It was me.

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:05.069
It's just that, when we
got out to Laird's...

01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:09.398
I just didn't feel like
I knew you anymore

01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:12.032
and I got scared.

01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:15.518
I just went crazy.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:19.514
This is me.

01:36:22.040 --> 01:36:23.393
I'm doing good.

01:36:25.080 --> 01:36:26.399
Oh, Dad.

01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:33.640
Oh, my God.

01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:35.199
Okay, look. I forgot...

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.416
Oh, God.
He's still out there.

01:36:36.440 --> 01:36:37.509
I know.

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:38.856
In a tank top and a scarf.

01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:40.096
And he knew
we were coming to Michigan.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.120
Yeah.

01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.520
Why doesn't
he just come inside?

01:36:42.560 --> 01:36:43.896
He has to talk to you
about something...

01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:46.434
He kind of wants to make
things right with you.

01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:48.033
Oh, does he?
Yeah.

01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:51.272
I think it'd be cool
if you gave him a chance.

01:36:53.240 --> 01:36:55.549
You want me
to give Laird a chance?

01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:59.474
I thought that if you saw
fit to give him a chance...

01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:02.279
I thought that
it'd be cool.

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.720
That's all. Well?

01:37:05.840 --> 01:37:07.432
Hi.
Hey.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:09.556
What's going on?
Oh, my God, it's cold out here.

01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:11.910
I know you're pissed,
but just hear me out.

01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:13.479
Can we talk inside?
No.

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:14.640
Oh, my...
Look.

01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:17.399
Oh, my God.
It's so romantic.

01:37:17.600 --> 01:37:18.794
I told him to keep
it simple.

01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:20.154
Oh, our little girl.

01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:22.456
He's gonna get down to his
knee and keep it real simple.

01:37:22.480 --> 01:37:23.754
How do you know all this?

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.069
I gave him
a few pointers.

01:37:25.240 --> 01:37:26.468
Oh.

01:37:27.640 --> 01:37:29.471
This has been the
happiest year of my life.

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:34.591
And fly! Go, go, go! Go!

01:37:36.440 --> 01:37:38.271
Oh, no.
What?

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:41.600
Ah.

01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:44.951
Oh, my God.

01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:47.156
Goose. God damn it.
I said no go! No go!

01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:48.355
Oh, my...

01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:49.475
Oh, gosh. Wow.

01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:50.656
Why did he do that?
Smart boy.

01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:52.716
Absolute fucking shit fest.

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:55.438
Babe, I'm so
sorry. Uh...

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:00.159
Stephanie Fleming...

01:38:00.680 --> 01:38:02.033
will you...
Are you proposing?

01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:03.997
Yeah.

01:38:04.120 --> 01:38:05.838
Mmm-hmm.

01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:07.279
Did my dad know
about this?

01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.592
Yeah, I asked
for his blessing

01:38:09.680 --> 01:38:11.113
that first morning
back in Cali.

01:38:11.320 --> 01:38:13.356
Oh, my God.

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:14.795
Oh, my God!

01:38:14.960 --> 01:38:17.474
No wonder he acted
so crazy. Honey.

01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:19.551
Yeah, that's why he was
a little out of whack.

01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:21.790
Yeah, we could have had
a really nice holiday.

01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:24.673
I know. But we're all
good now. Okay?

01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:26.990
This is a lot.

01:38:28.320 --> 01:38:29.878
Oh, my God.
Stephanie Fleming...

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:31.440
That's a ring.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.357
Goose! No!

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.991
And, go! Go, guys!
Go, go, go!

01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.154
Stephanie!

01:38:44.560 --> 01:38:45.560
Oh, my God.

01:38:57.520 --> 01:39:00.830
Laird, what is Kiss
doing here?

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:02.829
Um, well...

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:06.075
Is that...
Whoa!

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.394
He got look-a-likes!

01:39:07.560 --> 01:39:09.516
Those aren't
look-a-likes, Ned.

01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:10.874
That's Gene and Paul.

01:39:11.040 --> 01:39:14.032
It's Gene and Paul!
Gene and Paul!

01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:16.236
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:17.799
Kiss is in
the front yard!

01:39:17.960 --> 01:39:20.428
Tonight

01:39:20.640 --> 01:39:23.029
I wanna give it all to you

01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:25.920
In the darkness

01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.753
Originally, I had this more
elaborate proposal plan

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.592
but your dad gave me
this awesome advice

01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:31.869
and told me
not to do it.

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.439
But they're here,

01:39:33.560 --> 01:39:35.437
and I know how much
you love their music, so...

01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:36.874
What? Hi.

01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:40.794
I was made
for lovin' you, baby

01:39:40.960 --> 01:39:44.714
You were made for lovin' me

01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:46.711
And I can't get...

01:39:50.240 --> 01:39:52.117
Is he still proposing?
What's...

01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.713
They've stopped
playing now.

01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:55.831
- His name's Ned.
- Oh, my God, are they...

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:56.960
What?

01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:58.096
Are they coming in the...
Oh, my God.

01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.216
They're coming up
the sidewalk!

01:39:59.240 --> 01:40:00.240
They're heading in!

01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:01.880
They're coming in our house!
Oh, my God!

01:40:01.920 --> 01:40:03.831
Everybody act natural!
Act naturally!

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.228
I have to redecorate
the house!

01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:17.749
Hey.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:18.920
Hi.

01:40:19.080 --> 01:40:20.115
Hi.

01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:23.429
Uh, hi.

01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.113
- I'm Ned.
- Hey, Ned.

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:27.429
Hi!
Hi!

01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:29.192
This is my wife, Barb.

01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:30.759
This is our friends,
Lou and Patty.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:31.989
It's Lou.

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:33.593
So excited
you're here.

01:40:33.760 --> 01:40:37.036
I gotta tell you.
Uh, we are huge fans.

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:40.875
We've been members of the Kiss
Army for, like, 30 years now.

01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.679
Yeah. Our first date was
the Crazy Nights Tour.

01:40:43.840 --> 01:40:46.274
Yeah! And, boy,
was that crazy.

01:40:46.360 --> 01:40:47.429
Crazy.

01:40:48.160 --> 01:40:49.160
Did you get laid?

01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:53.480
Um...

01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:56.312
I gave him a handjob.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.873
Scotty.

01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.992
I'm having
an awesome time,

01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:02.473
but are you having
a buffet here?

01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:04.198
Oh, my God.
What was I thinking?

01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:05.793
Are you hungry?
Starving.

01:41:05.960 --> 01:41:07.712
Oh, God, of course!
Where's our manners?

01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:08.835
We're terrible hosts.

01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.136
Let's get those
guitars, guys.

01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:11.354
Come on,
let me get that axe.

01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:13.709
See my body?

01:41:13.800 --> 01:41:14.800
Wow! Kiss is
in our house!

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:18.031
Yeah. I'm kind of
juiced up a little bit.

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:20.357
Oh! I almost forgot
about them.

01:41:20.520 --> 01:41:22.351
Well...
The happy couple.

01:41:22.520 --> 01:41:23.999
Congratulations.

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.839
She said no.

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:27.720
I'm sorry, what?

01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:29.154
She said no.

01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:32.040
Well...

01:41:33.720 --> 01:41:34.869
Honey.

01:41:35.520 --> 01:41:37.158
I'm so flattered

01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.351
that you wanna marry me

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:40.880
but I'm not ready
for that.

01:41:44.400 --> 01:41:45.719
And I'm gonna
finish school.

01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:47.199
For me.

01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:48.839
Because that's what
I wanna do.

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:50.519
Got it?

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.352
That's really smart.

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:55.273
It's just,
I had this big plan

01:41:56.400 --> 01:41:57.674
and it didn't work out.

01:41:58.520 --> 01:42:00.590
Yeah.
Well, that's life, pal.

01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:05.233
That is so
well put, Ned.

01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:07.712
It's really,
really smart.

01:42:07.880 --> 01:42:09.552
Dude, did you
come up with that?

01:42:09.720 --> 01:42:11.358
The words, "That's life?"

01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.199
Ned, you're so full of
practical wisdom...

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.176
I was just really
looking forward

01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.428
to you being
my father-in-law.

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:18.640
Aw.

01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.631
I'm not breaking
up with you.

01:42:21.800 --> 01:42:22.800
You're not?

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:23.920
No, honey.

01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:25.560
No, no, no.
I'm still your girlfriend.

01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:27.358
We're still together.

01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.440
Oh.

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.074
Oh, thank God!

01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:32.275
Come here.

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:44.389
Merry Christmas.

01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:45.560
Ned.
Hey.

01:42:45.680 --> 01:42:47.238
Dude, your employees
are so cool.

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:48.674
Yeah, they are.

01:42:48.840 --> 01:42:50.990
Maybe it was wrong of me
to interfere like that,

01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:52.957
but why don't you
let me save your company?

01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:56.072
No, Laird,
I can't.

01:42:56.240 --> 01:42:58.231
That old model
doesn't work anymore.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.271
I guess...
I don't know.

01:43:00.480 --> 01:43:02.277
I guess I just didn't
want to believe it.

01:43:03.120 --> 01:43:04.758
But since you
mentioned it...

01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:07.070
I do have a business idea
I wanna run by you.

01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:08.793
Dude, elevator pitch me!

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:10.154
Okay.

01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:12.794
No, hold on.

01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.315
This wasn't my idea at all.
One second.

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:17.232
- Scotty, come here.
- Yo, what's up?

01:43:17.320 --> 01:43:18.320
Come here.
Yeah?

01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:19.936
I want you to tell Laird
about the business idea

01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.359
you mentioned
on the plane.

01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:22.520
Go ahead.
Wait, really?

01:43:22.600 --> 01:43:23.600
Yeah.

01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:25.400
Told you to get that seat
at the table, bro.

01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:27.040
You did. He told me,
Dad. He was, like...

01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:28.256
"You're gonna
get that seat."

01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:29.696
I can't believe
I finally got the seat.

01:43:29.720 --> 01:43:30.948
Dragons and
titties, baby.

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.951
Dragons and titties!

01:43:33.200 --> 01:43:34.600
Breathe that fire.

01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:35.720
Get up in there.

01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:38.518
Get up
in those titties!

01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:40.000
Gonna get those dragons.

01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:41.949
Dad...

01:43:42.480 --> 01:43:43.799
Scotty!

01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:46.520
Stop motorboating your dad,
and elevator pitch me.

01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:48.119
Sorry. Uh...

01:43:48.480 --> 01:43:51.313
Laird, I can't stop thinking
about your toilets, dude.

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.152
My toilets?
Yeah.

01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:54.958
The fresh feeling,
the scented talc.

01:43:55.160 --> 01:43:57.310
I was thinking if you can
get the controls in English

01:43:57.480 --> 01:43:59.240
and maybe lower the price
point a little bit,

01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:00.456
we could have
a potentially untapped

01:44:00.480 --> 01:44:01.480
market here in America.

01:44:01.520 --> 01:44:03.158
Oh, shit.
Right?

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.976
And look, we can contact
a Japanese manufacturer

01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:06.035
about pricing...
Ooh.

01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.555
No, Scotty. Pardon my French,
but fuck that noise.

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.195
Whoa.

01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:13.312
Listen. We have a factory
right here in Grand Rapids

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.675
with 37 of the best employees
you're ever gonna want.

01:44:15.840 --> 01:44:17.751
Let's build our own.

01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:20.751
Hells yes, Grateful Ned!
Yeah!

01:44:20.840 --> 01:44:22.239
Boom!

01:44:24.400 --> 01:44:25.515
Okay, sorry. Yeah.

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:35.876
The first noel
the angels did say

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:41.393
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay

01:44:41.560 --> 01:44:47.112
In fields where they lay
keeping their sheep

01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:52.798
On a cold winter's night
that was so deep

01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.518
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.553
It turned out to be a pretty
cool holiday after all, huh?

01:44:58.400 --> 01:44:59.549
It did, son.

01:45:01.480 --> 01:45:02.480
Dude.

01:45:03.040 --> 01:45:04.040
What?

01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.000
Told you you'd be
calling me "son" by Christmas.

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.837
Oh.

01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:09.717
That's just
a figure of speech.

01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:10.915
Sure, Dad.

01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:25.480
Merry Christmas,
I don't want to fight tonight

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:34.233
Hello there, you gang!
It is I, Gustav.

01:45:34.400 --> 01:45:36.675
It's so great to see you!

01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:39.400
Hey, what do you think
of the new facial hair, huh?

01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.397
I'm based in Michigan now,
so you know...

01:45:41.600 --> 01:45:42.816
I'm trying to do this
whole kind of

01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:44.159
Paul Bunyan, Midwestern thing.

01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.440
I wanted to fill it all out.

01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:49.078
So Scotty, Laird, and Ned
took the printing company...

01:45:49.320 --> 01:45:50.456
turned it into
a toilet factory...

01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:51.959
and it's going great!

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:54.998
The toilet is water efficient
und eco-friendly.

01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:56.479
It's state of the art.

01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:59.757
I'm telling you, they have
invented the Tesla of toilets!

01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:01.468
It's amazing.

01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:03.312
Barbara has made sure
that each toilet

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:05.118
has a state of the art
vaginal cleanse.

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:09.872
You know
exactly what I'm saying.

01:46:10.040 --> 01:46:11.598
Every single model
comes with Justine.

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:12.800
Talk about a smart toilet.

01:46:12.960 --> 01:46:14.176
She knows
if you need a little sploosh

01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.200
or if you actually need

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.800
the fountains
of the Bellagio up there.

01:46:18.600 --> 01:46:21.034
Scotty has finally
got his seat at the table.

01:46:21.680 --> 01:46:22.715
It's beautiful.

01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:24.678
He went a little too far
with the dragons,

01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.240
and the titties,
and the motorboating.

01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.800
Oy vey.

01:46:29.560 --> 01:46:30.629
Oh, Miss Stephanie.

01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:33.309
She had the idea to link
the Fleming-Mayhew company

01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:35.277
with the new foundation.

01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:37.630
So now, they're sponsoring
sewage projects

01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:39.916
all over the Third World.
I told you.

01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:42.434
Smart, smart, smart girl.

01:46:43.000 --> 01:46:45.833
So, things are working out
really well for the gang here.

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:47.719
The company is
a smashing success.

01:46:48.320 --> 01:46:49.878
And my dear Laird

01:46:50.280 --> 01:46:52.475
has finally gotten
what he's always wanted.

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:54.194
To be part of a family.

01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.358
All right, ciao for now,
you friends.

01:46:59.440 --> 01:47:00.589
Until we meet again.

01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.776
Laird, it doesn't count as
a sneak attack if I can see...

01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:04.552
Fuck you, Goose!
Scheisse!

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:11.831
I wanna rock and roll
all night

01:47:12.840 --> 01:47:14.910
And party every day

01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:18.636
I wanna rock and roll
all night

01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:21.597
And party every day

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:27.759
You keep on saying
you'll be mine for a while

01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:31.397
You're looking fancy
and I like your style

01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:36.198
You drive us wild,
we'll drive you crazy

01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:41.999
You show us
everything you've got

01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:44.994
Baby, baby, it's quite a lot

01:47:45.720 --> 01:47:50.191
You drive us wild,
we 'll drive you crazy

01:47:52.520 --> 01:47:55.637
You keep on shouting,
you keep on shouting

01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:03.231
I wanna rock and roll
all night

01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:06.117
And party every day

01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:10.068
I wanna rock and roll
all night

01:48:11.320 --> 01:48:13.117
And party every day

01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:16.994
I wanna rock and roll
all night

01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:19.757
And party every day

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:23.429
I wanna rock and roll
all night

01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:26.392
And party every day
