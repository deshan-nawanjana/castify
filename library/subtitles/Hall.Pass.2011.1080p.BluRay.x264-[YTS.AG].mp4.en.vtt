00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.543
HALL PASS

2
00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.553
Do you recognize who this stud is
in the blue shorts right here?

3
00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:55.097
That's me
the summer I got out of college.

4
00:00:55.138 --> 00:00:58.141
Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles.

5
00:00:58.308 --> 00:01:00.102
Well, I still got a few.

6
00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:01.353
Where?

7
00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.188
They're hibernating.

8
00:01:04.982 --> 00:01:06.191
Who's that girl?

9
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:07.693
That's Mommy.

10
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.654
No, the young one standing next to you.

11
00:01:10.821 --> 00:01:12.447
That's Mommy.

12
00:01:12.656 --> 00:01:15.284
How come Mommy
doesn't wear a bikini anymore?

13
00:01:15.492 --> 00:01:17.619
Is it because of her fat ass?

14
00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:19.997
Yeah. I guess.

15
00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:23.333
What? No.
Who said Mommy has a fat ass?

16
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.960
Mommy did.

17
00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:26.587
Words hurt, Gunnar.

18
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:31.425
Hey, honey. We better get a move on. We
gotta meet up with Fred and Grace soon.

19
00:01:31.592 --> 00:01:33.635
No, I know, I know. I'm trying.

20
00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:35.554
How long do you think you're gonna be?

21
00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:39.016
Uh, 45 minutes?
Less, if you help with the kids.

22
00:01:39.183 --> 00:01:40.851
No, 45 minutes is good.

23
00:01:41.018 --> 00:01:44.021
And this photograph is of me
in high school.

24
00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:46.815
I'm kidding. A joke. Come on.

25
00:01:47.024 --> 00:01:51.486
Okay, come on. Bath time. Time to scrub
some backs and clean some cracks.

26
00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.076
I miss going out with you
on Saturday nights.

27
00:01:58.243 --> 00:02:01.163
I wanna have a new policy of going out
six nights a week without the kids.

28
00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.000
I think it would be good for us
to go out one night a week...

29
00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:08.295
-...where it's just you and me. It would be--
-You gotta be kidding.

30
00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:10.547
-What?
-You just checked out that girl's butt.

31
00:02:10.714 --> 00:02:13.050
-Who did?
-You did. And it's rude.

32
00:02:13.217 --> 00:02:15.385
-What? Do you think she noticed?
-I noticed.

33
00:02:15.552 --> 00:02:18.180
Oh, yeah, yeah.
I'm just spacy tonight, honey, I'm sorry.

34
00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:20.182
Hey, guys, come on. We're late.

35
00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.226
-Hey.
-Hi.

36
00:02:22.392 --> 00:02:23.727
-Hey, Rick.
-How you doing?

37
00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:26.438
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

38
00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.398
Grace, let me ask you a question.

39
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.026
Does Fred ever check out other women
in front of you?

40
00:02:31.193 --> 00:02:34.655
No, no. Fred's not a gawker.
He's a good boy. Ha, ha.

41
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:37.282
-Hmm.
-Come on, let's go say hi to Dr. Lucy.

42
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.910
-Let's go get a beer.
-Yeah.

43
00:02:40.077 --> 00:02:42.371
-Hey.
-Hi.

44
00:02:42.538 --> 00:02:44.581
-Congratulations.
-Thank you, thank you.

45
00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:46.291
Our first friend to win an award.

46
00:02:46.458 --> 00:02:48.877
Oh, stop it.
Listen, I don't deserve this thing.

47
00:02:49.044 --> 00:02:51.380
-Oh. Come on. Yes, you do. Yes, you do.
-Oh, come on.

48
00:02:51.547 --> 00:02:54.299
-The whole thing is just embarrassing.
-Stop it.

49
00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:55.759
What is this, amateur hour?

50
00:02:55.926 --> 00:02:58.428
How does your wife catch you
checking out another girl?

51
00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:01.265
She walked by and I glanced back
for like half a second.

52
00:03:01.431 --> 00:03:03.308
-Two beers, please.
-You got it.

53
00:03:03.475 --> 00:03:07.271
Hey, Quagmire, you don't wait for the girl
to walk past and glance back at her.

54
00:03:07.437 --> 00:03:11.775
You spot her from 15 feet away, turn, then
wait for her to walk into your line of vision.

55
00:03:11.942 --> 00:03:13.610
-What do you mean?
-Don't you get it?

56
00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:16.280
You can't help if her butt walks
where you're looking.

57
00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:18.574
Where you're looking.
It was your air space.

58
00:03:18.782 --> 00:03:20.242
-What could you do?
-Exactly.

59
00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:21.577
-Is that an original?
-No.

60
00:03:21.785 --> 00:03:22.953
-Who?
-Coakley.

61
00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.580
-Coakley? He did.
-Hey, guys.

62
00:03:24.746 --> 00:03:25.831
Hey, Missy.

63
00:03:25.998 --> 00:03:28.083
Drink up, guys.
Let's get this party started.

64
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.251
-Yes.
-Whoo!

65
00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.961
-Whoo! Ha, ha.
-Whoo! OW.

66
00:03:31.128 --> 00:03:34.214
Missy sure is looking chipper for
someone going through a divorce.

67
00:03:34.381 --> 00:03:35.757
Yeah. God.

68
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:37.676
You know what I love about divorc�es?

69
00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:38.969
They love sex.

70
00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.679
-Is that true?
-I don't know.

71
00:03:40.888 --> 00:03:44.349
-I like to think so, though. Ha, ha.
-You would like to think it was true.

72
00:03:44.516 --> 00:03:45.559
God.

73
00:03:45.726 --> 00:03:48.353
Look at those meatheads
checking out Missy.

74
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.898
-Do they think, they're invisible?
-I know.

75
00:03:51.064 --> 00:03:53.150
Hey, I thought you said Fred
isn't a gawker.

76
00:03:53.317 --> 00:03:56.028
He was standing right there.
I can't let him know I know.

77
00:03:56.195 --> 00:03:58.447
-It'll take all the fun out of it.
-Ha, ha.

78
00:03:58.614 --> 00:04:01.533
Oh, God, he has this stupid move
where he looks back...

79
00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.535
...and he waits for the girl to pass...

80
00:04:03.702 --> 00:04:06.663
...so that it seems like he couldn't
help but notice her ass. It's pathetic.

81
00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:11.835
You wanna hear a great idea?

82
00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:15.297
Why don't you go upstairs
and slip into something uncomfortable...

83
00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.257
...while I give the babysitter a ride home?

84
00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:20.636
I want to, honey. I really do.

85
00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.555
It's after midnight
and I gotta get up early with the kids.

86
00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:26.391
No, I'll get up with the kids.
I'll take them to the park.

87
00:04:26.558 --> 00:04:29.853
I'll take them to Finn's birthday party.
You just stay in bed...

88
00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.898
...and play back some of the more
acrobatic highlights...

89
00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:35.359
...from the show
I'm about to put on for you.

90
00:04:35.526 --> 00:04:38.904
-Mm. Okay. I'm in. Ha, ha.
-Ah.

91
00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:40.739
They're home!

92
00:04:40.906 --> 00:04:41.949
Sorry.

93
00:04:42.115 --> 00:04:44.868
He couldn't fall asleep.

94
00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:46.787
So how were the little monsters tonight?

95
00:04:46.954 --> 00:04:48.413
Perfect.

96
00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.415
That Gunnar is so cute.

97
00:04:50.582 --> 00:04:53.669
He's like a little monkey.
He just wants to climb all over me.

98
00:04:55.212 --> 00:04:56.213
Hmm.

99
00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.300
All right, here we are.

100
00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:02.678
Good night. Thank you.

101
00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.721
Mr. Mills, can I ask you something?

102
00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:05.889
Yeah, shoot.

103
00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:07.307
I was wondering, um....

104
00:05:08.016 --> 00:05:09.393
Could you buy me some beer?

105
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.644
Buy you some--?

106
00:05:11.061 --> 00:05:12.229
How old are you?

107
00:05:12.396 --> 00:05:14.398
I'll be 21 next week.

108
00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:18.110
-Wow. That's a biggie. Happy birthday.
-Yeah.

109
00:05:18.735 --> 00:05:20.070
So could you?

110
00:05:20.237 --> 00:05:22.739
Well, you know,
the law's pretty clear on this.

111
00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.117
I think you can get into a lot of trouble--

112
00:05:25.284 --> 00:05:27.119
Come on, I'm a junior in college.

113
00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:28.912
You drank when you were in college.

114
00:05:29.079 --> 00:05:31.915
-I....
-Besides, it's so arbitrary.

115
00:05:32.082 --> 00:05:34.585
How does it make sense that 20's
old enough to vote or watch porn...

116
00:05:34.751 --> 00:05:37.421
-...but it's too young to have a beer?
-Really?

117
00:05:37.588 --> 00:05:39.798
Twenty's old enough to, um--?

118
00:05:39.965 --> 00:05:42.634
-Vote?
-No. The other thing.

119
00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:45.679
Watch porn? Yeah. Half the girls
in those things are my age.

120
00:05:45.846 --> 00:05:49.600
I mean, unless it's that weird fetish stuff
where the women are, like, 40. Ha, ha.

121
00:05:49.766 --> 00:05:50.809
Mm.

122
00:05:50.976 --> 00:05:53.604
Look, I promise,
no one's gonna find out.

123
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:57.649
Join me down at the river. We'll listen
to some tunes and suck down a few beers.

124
00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:02.529
Oh....

125
00:06:07.075 --> 00:06:08.076
Freeze right there!

126
00:06:08.285 --> 00:06:10.329
You're under arrest for supplying alcohol
to a minor.

127
00:06:10.495 --> 00:06:11.955
Mills, you're fired!

128
00:06:12.206 --> 00:06:14.958
I award your wife the house,
the cars and half your wages.

129
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:18.462
I don't want you walking me down
the aisle. You cheated on Mom!

130
00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:21.006
I don't want you at my civil ceremony.
You cheated!

131
00:06:21.298 --> 00:06:22.299
Get out.

132
00:06:22.966 --> 00:06:24.009
What?

133
00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.306
What I mean is that I'm sorry,
I can't do that.

134
00:06:29.806 --> 00:06:30.849
Why not?

135
00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.355
Because it would be inappropriate,
Paige.

136
00:06:36.563 --> 00:06:39.983
What, is that your adult voice?
"That would be inappropriate, Paige."

137
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.027
-Come on, it's for the--
-No, Paige.

138
00:06:42.194 --> 00:06:45.197
What are you thinking?
I'm a married man. I have children.

139
00:06:45.364 --> 00:06:48.575
You think they'd like me at the river
alone drinking with a coed?

140
00:06:48.742 --> 00:06:52.496
I never said alone. My boyfriend
and his roommates are down there.

141
00:06:56.834 --> 00:06:59.336
Okay, you better head inside now.

142
00:06:59.503 --> 00:07:01.171
Good night, Paige.

143
00:07:01.505 --> 00:07:02.589
Ew.

144
00:07:02.756 --> 00:07:06.093
-What the hell were you thinking?
-Okay, scoot along now, Paige.

145
00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.140
Oh, thank God, you're still awake.

146
00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:15.477
Quiet. Gunnar just fell asleep.

147
00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:18.188
Okay. Let's tiptoe.

148
00:07:18.355 --> 00:07:21.441
-Be very quiet, but still excited.
-Ha, ha.

149
00:07:22.192 --> 00:07:23.735
-Okay.
-Ha, ha.

150
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.280
I'm scared.

151
00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:29.366
-Can I sleep with you tonight?
-Aw.

152
00:07:29.533 --> 00:07:31.368
-Daddy?
-No, absolutely not.

153
00:07:31.535 --> 00:07:33.620
Daddy, words hurt, you know.

154
00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:35.330
-Well....
-Come on, she's scared.

155
00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:37.374
-We can let her--
-What? Are you serious?

156
00:07:37.541 --> 00:07:39.877
Look, this isn't just
about her cockblocking me.

157
00:07:40.043 --> 00:07:43.380
I don't like that my daughter needs
someone to sleep with her every night.

158
00:07:43.547 --> 00:07:45.799
That's not gonna be good
when she goes to college.

159
00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:49.219
Well, can someone
at least read me a story?

160
00:07:49.845 --> 00:07:51.346
Okay, one quick story.

161
00:07:51.555 --> 00:07:53.140
Jump up.

162
00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.685
And what is this new expression,
words hurt?

163
00:07:56.852 --> 00:07:58.312
-Where did you get that?
-Mommy.

164
00:07:58.478 --> 00:07:59.521
-Mommy?
-Mm-hm.

165
00:07:59.688 --> 00:08:01.106
Okay, well,
Mommy isn't always right.

166
00:08:01.273 --> 00:08:03.734
You know what my dad had?
A belt. Yeah. Now, that hurt.

167
00:08:03.901 --> 00:08:06.111
"Amazingly, our plan worked.

168
00:08:06.278 --> 00:08:10.574
The gum kept the door from banging, and
we never heard 'Don't slam the door' again.

169
00:08:10.741 --> 00:08:11.783
The end."

170
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.785
-There. You look pretty, Daddy.
-Good.

171
00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:18.165
Okay, that was the last ponytail.
It's time for you to go night-night.

172
00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.417
Give me a big hug and a kiss.

173
00:08:20.584 --> 00:08:23.629
Mwah. Mwah.

174
00:08:24.296 --> 00:08:26.757
-I love you, Emma.
-I love you more.

175
00:08:26.924 --> 00:08:29.218
No, I love you more.

176
00:08:34.765 --> 00:08:37.309
Honey? Honey?

177
00:08:37.601 --> 00:08:39.102
Honey?

178
00:08:39.937 --> 00:08:42.272
No. No.

179
00:09:10.467 --> 00:09:12.052
I won. Unh.

180
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:16.431
Come on. Let's go to the slides, Gunnar.

181
00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.600
Can you believe
all the talent here today?

182
00:09:18.767 --> 00:09:19.768
I know.

183
00:09:19.977 --> 00:09:21.645
I mean, look at this buffet of ass.

184
00:09:21.812 --> 00:09:23.689
Imagine coming here back
when we were single.

185
00:09:23.856 --> 00:09:26.358
-Ooh. The damage we would do?
-Ha, ha, oh, boy.

186
00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:28.652
Oh, man. Oh.

187
00:09:28.819 --> 00:09:30.946
-Hey, did you get any action last night?
-Nah.

188
00:09:31.113 --> 00:09:33.782
Came close, but kids were awake
when we got home.

189
00:09:33.949 --> 00:09:35.617
-What about you, you get lucky?
-No.

190
00:09:35.784 --> 00:09:36.952
Well, I mean, kind of.

191
00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:39.538
You know, Grace conked out
right when we got home...

192
00:09:39.705 --> 00:09:42.499
...so I snuck out to the car,
rubbed one out.

193
00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:44.501
What are you, Knight Rider?

194
00:09:44.668 --> 00:09:47.296
Why can't you do it in the bathroom
like every other guy?

195
00:09:47.462 --> 00:09:50.174
What, and get caught by Grace?
No way. I can't risk that. Uh-uh.

196
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:51.884
No, besides, cars turn me on.

197
00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.011
It's where I lost my virginity.

198
00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:56.805
So I go out there, put the seat back,
pump some tunes.

199
00:09:57.014 --> 00:09:58.390
It's pretty nice.

200
00:10:00.184 --> 00:10:02.561
That's one of those things
they don't tell you, huh?

201
00:10:02.728 --> 00:10:03.812
What?

202
00:10:03.979 --> 00:10:06.773
That you're still gonna be jerking off
after you get married.

203
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:09.860
I mean, I thought that was just gonna be
a teenage thing, right?

204
00:10:10.027 --> 00:10:12.863
Yeah, I didn't see that one coming.

205
00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.364
I gotta get going.

206
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:17.117
I gotta drop the kids off
at a birthday party.

207
00:10:17.284 --> 00:10:19.745
Hmm. You wanna
get a coffee afterwards?

208
00:10:19.912 --> 00:10:22.122
Yeah. Guys, come on!

209
00:10:25.042 --> 00:10:26.877
You all right? You okay?

210
00:10:27.044 --> 00:10:28.378
Yeah.

211
00:10:28.545 --> 00:10:30.672
I tweaked my neck
on the 17th hole yesterday.

212
00:10:30.881 --> 00:10:33.675
I was 250 out. Had to get over
some water. I gave it my all.

213
00:10:33.842 --> 00:10:35.802
-I didn't know you played yesterday.
-Yeah.

214
00:10:35.969 --> 00:10:39.765
Hog-Head and I played some "Golden Tee"
at McGillicuddy's and it was like: Aah.

215
00:10:39.932 --> 00:10:42.893
Yeah, you gotta stretch.
Because even something like foosball...

216
00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:46.730
...I've thrown my back out where
it's, like, the thing where you--

217
00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:52.778
Oh, my God.

218
00:10:52.945 --> 00:10:54.905
-Hey. What can I get you?
-Small coffee.

219
00:10:55.072 --> 00:10:56.073
Sure.

220
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.368
Please don't have a nice ass.
Please don't have a nice ass.

221
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:02.788
Please don't have a nice--
Oh, come on, man.

222
00:11:02.955 --> 00:11:04.748
-That is ridiculous.
-I know.

223
00:11:04.915 --> 00:11:07.167
I did some recon. She's from Australia.

224
00:11:07.334 --> 00:11:10.587
-Of course she is. Shit. Don't bring me here.
-She's been here about a month. What?

225
00:11:10.754 --> 00:11:13.924
-Shh. Here she comes, here she comes.
-All right. Thanks.

226
00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:15.926
-Hey.
-Hi.

227
00:11:16.093 --> 00:11:19.513
Uh, iced coffee, one Splenda, right?

228
00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:21.431
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

229
00:11:21.598 --> 00:11:22.850
And for your mate?

230
00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:24.768
Same.

231
00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:27.187
-Two Splendas.
-Okay.

232
00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.192
-So pretty.
-Chik. Chik. Chik. zz.

233
00:11:32.359 --> 00:11:33.902
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

234
00:11:34.111 --> 00:11:36.446
Taking mental photographs
for my spank bank.

235
00:11:36.613 --> 00:11:37.823
Fred, come on, dude. Just--

236
00:11:44.288 --> 00:11:45.914
You need help.

237
00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:48.667
No. She already got us. Thank you.

238
00:11:48.834 --> 00:11:50.419
Wasn't a question.

239
00:11:50.586 --> 00:11:52.004
Kid's right.

240
00:11:52.171 --> 00:11:55.757
-Come on, guys, give it a rest.
-Hey, Ed. I didn't see you standing there.

241
00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.968
Because you were eye-banging
the java babe.

242
00:11:58.135 --> 00:11:59.178
-No.
-No.

243
00:11:59.344 --> 00:12:01.221
You're married men. She's half your age.

244
00:12:01.388 --> 00:12:03.473
Maybe a little growing up?
What do you think?

245
00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.393
Hey, I guess I'm gonna see you
at the housewarming party next weekend.

246
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.603
Huh?

247
00:12:07.769 --> 00:12:09.563
Yeah, next Saturday afternoon
at the new casa.

248
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.565
We're finally in.
We're having a little soiree.

249
00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:12.774
Hmm.

250
00:12:12.941 --> 00:12:15.402
-Next Satur-- I think that could be tough.
-Yeah, we're jammed.

251
00:12:15.569 --> 00:12:16.987
Your wives already RSVP'd.

252
00:12:17.154 --> 00:12:19.156
-Oh. Cool.
-Can't wait.

253
00:12:19.323 --> 00:12:21.158
Till then. Come on, pound the potato.

254
00:12:21.325 --> 00:12:23.744
-Pshh. Ha, ha.
-Uh-oh. Ha, ha.

255
00:12:23.911 --> 00:12:25.412
Pound it.

256
00:12:25.829 --> 00:12:26.997
Pshh.

257
00:12:27.164 --> 00:12:28.790
-Take care, guys.
-Okay.

258
00:12:28.999 --> 00:12:30.459
Bye, Ed.

259
00:12:30.667 --> 00:12:32.794
I'll pound his potato,
you know what I mean?

260
00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:35.464
-He's a good guy.
-He is a nice guy.

261
00:12:37.174 --> 00:12:38.634
-You open, Rick.
-I know.

262
00:12:38.842 --> 00:12:41.678
Okay, uh, I'll say three 9s.

263
00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.805
Conservative,
but that's what I'm going for.

264
00:12:44.014 --> 00:12:45.766
Where's Coakley?
Why didn't he show up?

265
00:12:45.933 --> 00:12:50.270
Coakley is in Arizona,
attending the Hawaiian Tropic regionals.

266
00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:52.689
-But of course. But of course.
-Four 9s.

267
00:12:52.856 --> 00:12:54.900
Imagine being Coakley, huh?

268
00:12:55.067 --> 00:12:57.861
That guy's single, he's loaded.
Chicks love him.

269
00:12:58.028 --> 00:12:59.863
He doesn't have to answer to anybody.

270
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.865
-Five 3s.
-Let me ask you something.

271
00:13:02.032 --> 00:13:04.785
How much would you pay to have your way
with a Hawaiian Tropic girl...

272
00:13:04.952 --> 00:13:06.453
...for a weekend, hmm?

273
00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.748
You can have anyone you want.
You know she's not gonna get pregnant.

274
00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:11.959
-No disease.
-Not gonna cry rape.

275
00:13:12.125 --> 00:13:14.753
Never hear from her again.
Your wife will never find out.

276
00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.506
How would I know
my wife wouldn't find out?

277
00:13:17.714 --> 00:13:18.757
It's a game.

278
00:13:18.924 --> 00:13:21.510
-I'm just saying if it was possible.
-It's a scenario.

279
00:13:21.718 --> 00:13:23.846
Like I'm a genie
and I can make it happen.

280
00:13:24.012 --> 00:13:26.932
-I can see that. A genie. Yeah. Ha, ha.
-Thank you. Thank you.

281
00:13:27.099 --> 00:13:30.018
I can grant you this wish
and make like it never happened.

282
00:13:30.185 --> 00:13:31.770
Okay. You know What? I'll say it.

283
00:13:31.979 --> 00:13:35.732
I would be willing to pay 250
of your American dollars.

284
00:13:37.234 --> 00:13:38.235
You cheap bastard.

285
00:13:38.402 --> 00:13:40.112
This is an investment, man.

286
00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:42.865
Get your rocks off, right?
Protect your wife's feelings.

287
00:13:43.073 --> 00:13:45.450
-I'm going deep with it. Five grand.
-Oh!

288
00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:47.494
-Five grand?
-Five grand, baby.

289
00:13:47.661 --> 00:13:50.164
And I know Hogwarts right here
would pay more.

290
00:13:50.330 --> 00:13:53.041
-Hey, guys. Hi.
-That's why he wears a tie.

291
00:13:53.625 --> 00:13:55.961
-Hey, Maggie.
-Hey, how's it going?

292
00:13:56.128 --> 00:13:58.422
Hey, do you remember
my brother-in-law, Flats?

293
00:13:58.589 --> 00:14:00.257
-Pleasure.
-Nice to see you again.

294
00:14:00.424 --> 00:14:01.466
-Who's winning?
-Uh-oh.

295
00:14:01.633 --> 00:14:03.594
This guy right here's got all the loot.

296
00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:04.845
-What?
-Ha, ha.

297
00:14:05.012 --> 00:14:08.515
Would you do me a favor and not tell Grace
that I have disposable income?

298
00:14:08.682 --> 00:14:10.475
She'll make me take her shopping...

299
00:14:10.642 --> 00:14:12.394
...or, like, see Kathy Griffin in concert.

300
00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.272
-Yeah.
-Okay.

301
00:14:15.439 --> 00:14:16.732
How'd the kids go down?

302
00:14:16.899 --> 00:14:20.110
Gunnar and Emma stalled for a while,
but they weren't too bad.

303
00:14:20.277 --> 00:14:23.405
-What about the baby?
-The baby? Not a peep.

304
00:14:23.614 --> 00:14:25.240
-I've been listening the whole time.
-Oh.

305
00:14:25.407 --> 00:14:26.575
-Yeah.
-All right.

306
00:14:26.742 --> 00:14:28.493
-Well, good night.
-Mwah.

307
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:30.662
-All right. Have fun.
-Okay.

308
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:33.373
-What is that? Four 7 s. Is that good?
-She's kidding.

309
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.459
-Maybe. Maybe I'm not kidding.
-Ha, ha.

310
00:14:35.626 --> 00:14:37.461
See you later.

311
00:14:41.632 --> 00:14:44.259
Hey, genie, can you make my dick work?

312
00:14:44.468 --> 00:14:46.178
Oh, you poor thing.

313
00:14:46.345 --> 00:14:49.181
Oh, silly Daddy
got the monitors mixed up.

314
00:14:51.475 --> 00:14:54.394
Oh, have you been listening
to those loudmouths all night?

315
00:14:54.561 --> 00:14:56.605
A question to you, Frederick, sir.

316
00:14:56.813 --> 00:15:00.651
How much would you be willing to spend
for a weekend of erotic pleasures...

317
00:15:00.817 --> 00:15:04.029
-...with one of the most beautiful women?
-Six grand.

318
00:15:04.196 --> 00:15:07.407
I've gotta figure a way to get
the money out of the checking account.

319
00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:09.993
-I assume the genie could help with that?
-Oh. I got you.

320
00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.037
-I'll just give you my routing number?
-Ha, ha.

321
00:15:12.204 --> 00:15:15.249
Hey, hey, put me down for 7500.

322
00:15:15.415 --> 00:15:18.794
Hog-Head,
please, man. You don't have $7500.

323
00:15:18.961 --> 00:15:20.379
Hey, be nice.

324
00:15:20.546 --> 00:15:22.756
Okay, Rickster. Ha, ha!

325
00:15:22.923 --> 00:15:24.132
What is your number?

326
00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:27.344
-Ahh, I don't know.
-Come on. You've gotta have a number.

327
00:15:27.511 --> 00:15:29.429
-I don't know.
-Any girl you choose.

328
00:15:29.596 --> 00:15:32.683
You could do anything you want.
The wife will never find out.

329
00:15:32.850 --> 00:15:35.435
Completely harmless.
One-time thing. What would you pay?

330
00:15:35.602 --> 00:15:38.355
-I honestly don't know.
-Ballpark, please.

331
00:15:38.522 --> 00:15:40.148
Well, I have a great wife...

332
00:15:40.315 --> 00:15:42.860
...so I wouldn't wanna do anything
to hurt her feelings.

333
00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.737
So I guess the real question becomes...

334
00:15:45.904 --> 00:15:47.197
...what wouldn't I pay?

335
00:15:48.782 --> 00:15:51.034
That's why this dude's wearing the hat.

336
00:15:51.869 --> 00:15:53.704
This house has gotta be
worth something, right?

337
00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.375
Now, mother-in-laws.
What do they go for on the black market?

338
00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:00.043
Fifty bucks, maybe?

339
00:16:00.210 --> 00:16:04.756
Fred said 6 grand?
Oh, God, what a douche bag.

340
00:16:04.923 --> 00:16:08.385
He won't even spend $60 on An Evening
With Kathy Griffin tickets for me...

341
00:16:08.552 --> 00:16:11.555
...but he's gonna give some
make-believe genie 6 G's?

342
00:16:11.722 --> 00:16:13.390
-Wanna hear something funnier?
-Yeah.

343
00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:15.684
Hog-Head McCormick said 7500.

344
00:16:15.851 --> 00:16:17.227
-Wow.
-What?

345
00:16:17.394 --> 00:16:20.856
Look, I mean, on the bright side,
they're not cheating on us, right?

346
00:16:21.023 --> 00:16:23.150
-Although that'd be kind of fun to watch.
-Ha, ha.

347
00:16:23.317 --> 00:16:25.068
I'd love to see the look
on the girl's face...

348
00:16:25.235 --> 00:16:27.738
...when she wakes up next to Fred
with his sleep apnea mask on.

349
00:16:29.072 --> 00:16:30.949
Are you kidding?
He wears one of those things...

350
00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:33.243
-...with the mask and the tube?
-Yeah, it's awful.

351
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:34.703
That is attractive.

352
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:36.872
Every time I wake up,
I think a plane's going down.

353
00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:42.169
You know, sometimes I wonder
if it wouldn't be better if they did cheat.

354
00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:43.378
Just got it over with.

355
00:16:43.545 --> 00:16:47.466
You mean rather than take
the slow boat to resentment?

356
00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:52.012
I'm just saying, maybe a little freedom
would be good for them, and for you.

357
00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:54.389
Have you ever considered giving
him a hall pass?

358
00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:57.309
-A What?
-A hall pass. A week off from marriage.

359
00:16:57.518 --> 00:16:58.560
-No.
-Heh.

360
00:16:58.727 --> 00:17:01.813
Wait a minute. Are you saying
let them go out and cheat?

361
00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.107
I'm saying, give them a week off
from marriage.

362
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:09.321
Look, most married men have very
foggy memories of their single days...

363
00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.449
...and they begin to believe
that if not for you...

364
00:17:12.616 --> 00:17:14.451
...they could be with these other women.

365
00:17:14.618 --> 00:17:15.744
That's Fred.

366
00:17:15.953 --> 00:17:18.580
I mean, he thinks
because he sees big tits all day long...

367
00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:21.416
...and he manages to make it home
without squeezing one...

368
00:17:21.625 --> 00:17:24.419
...that I should be greeting him
at the door like some hero.

369
00:17:24.586 --> 00:17:27.881
Maybe it's time to let them
go out there and find out what it's like.

370
00:17:28.048 --> 00:17:30.467
-Huh?
-It's called the reactance theory.

371
00:17:30.634 --> 00:17:33.053
It's a principle in psychology
which says...

372
00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:36.348
...that if you constantly tell someone
they can't do something...

373
00:17:36.515 --> 00:17:38.433
...they just want to do it
more than ever.

374
00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.562
Conversely, if you remove the taboo,
you remove the obsession.

375
00:17:41.728 --> 00:17:43.438
You know What? I have an idea, doc.

376
00:17:43.647 --> 00:17:47.609
Why don' t you let your husband have a
hall pass and let us know how it turns out?

377
00:17:47.818 --> 00:17:49.027
Oh, I have.

378
00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:52.948
Are you telling us you let Charlie
sleep with another woman?

379
00:17:53.115 --> 00:17:57.119
I'm not telling you that. I gave him
the freedom to choose for himself.

380
00:17:57.661 --> 00:17:58.871
And?

381
00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.832
All I know is our marriage
is better than ever.

382
00:18:13.969 --> 00:18:15.512
All right.

383
00:18:17.306 --> 00:18:19.975
Here, I'll get it. I'll get it, watch.
Watch, watch, watch.

384
00:18:20.517 --> 00:18:23.520
-Oh, wow, look at this place.
-Pretty good, huh?

385
00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:27.232
-Hey.
-There he is, the lord of the manor.

386
00:18:27.399 --> 00:18:30.235
You see the Prius? we're going green.

387
00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:31.570
I can see that.

388
00:18:31.737 --> 00:18:33.113
Everybody in the shack!

389
00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.449
-The grand tour's about to begin!
-Come on!

390
00:18:35.991 --> 00:18:37.159
I call it headquarters.

391
00:18:37.367 --> 00:18:41.246
And behind that wall, the war room.
A 300-square-foot humidor.

392
00:18:41.413 --> 00:18:45.375
The humidity in there never gets above
71 percent and never below 70.

393
00:18:45.542 --> 00:18:49.046
Oh! Unbelievable.
How does he come up with this stuff, huh?

394
00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:51.590
Aw, thank you, Mandy.
l threw in a backup generator...

395
00:18:51.757 --> 00:18:54.801
...in case we lose power
and the main genny doesn't kick in.

396
00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:56.386
It's absolutely epic, Ed.

397
00:18:56.553 --> 00:18:58.013
Who wants a Cubano, huh?

398
00:18:58.180 --> 00:19:01.725
Oh, wait a second, Eddie.
First I want to show them my headquarters.

399
00:19:01.892 --> 00:19:03.477
-Come, come.
-Everybody upstairs.

400
00:19:03.644 --> 00:19:05.812
Hey, Larry, I'll get you a cigar. Come on.

401
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:13.237
I can't stand these look-at-how-much-I-own
parties. They're obnoxious.

402
00:19:13.403 --> 00:19:17.407
When I got my fully loaded Honda Odyssey,
I didn't go around bragging about it, did I?

403
00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:21.036
Well, kind of. You made me drive
around town for two hours, remember?

404
00:19:21.203 --> 00:19:23.872
Well, I thought you'd like
to watch a movie in a minivan.

405
00:19:24.081 --> 00:19:26.750
-You never watched a movie in a minivan.
-No.

406
00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:29.044
But did you have
to hook your boat up to it?

407
00:19:29.253 --> 00:19:31.630
Yeah. Yeah. It's a touring edition, dick.

408
00:19:31.797 --> 00:19:33.632
Fridge, Sub-zero.

409
00:19:33.799 --> 00:19:37.761
The floors are French limestone
and the countertops are Brazilian granite.

410
00:19:37.928 --> 00:19:39.179
It's my paradise.

411
00:19:39.346 --> 00:19:42.891
With a price tag north of 240 large,
it better be paradise.

412
00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.269
See, this is why the terrorists hate us.

413
00:19:45.435 --> 00:19:48.522
Oh. I love Brazilian granite.
How come I don't have Brazilian granite?

414
00:19:48.689 --> 00:19:53.277
If you recall, we had to make a couple of
fairly substantial expenditures. Remember?

415
00:19:54.194 --> 00:19:55.737
Hey, gang, check this out.

416
00:19:55.904 --> 00:20:00.075
Oh. Honey, don't show them that.
They're gonna think we're wackos.

417
00:20:00.242 --> 00:20:03.036
Sweetie, don't keep me down.

418
00:20:03.912 --> 00:20:06.707
-What the hell is this?
-Get in here, you're gonna love this.

419
00:20:06.874 --> 00:20:08.959
Hey, where are the guys?

420
00:20:11.503 --> 00:20:14.715
Wow. This is like secret-agent stuff.

421
00:20:14.882 --> 00:20:16.884
I think a safe room is a bit over-the-top.

422
00:20:17.050 --> 00:20:19.511
Ed thought with the little ones
you can never be too cautious.

423
00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.638
Oh. You're such a good daddy.

424
00:20:21.805 --> 00:20:23.265
No, I disagree.

425
00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.350
Here comes Tweedledee and Tweedledum.

426
00:20:25.517 --> 00:20:27.978
Who gets a minivan
when they don't have any kids?

427
00:20:28.478 --> 00:20:31.523
Wow, man. You just don't understand
the insurance game, do you, Rick?

428
00:20:31.690 --> 00:20:34.735
-Ah, enlighten me.
-When you pull into a person's driveway...

429
00:20:34.902 --> 00:20:37.696
...to sell them insurance,
who do you think they'd rather see?

430
00:20:37.863 --> 00:20:40.282
Some knucklehead hotshot
in a convertible Sebring...

431
00:20:40.449 --> 00:20:42.117
...or a family man in a minivan?

432
00:20:42.284 --> 00:20:44.244
Where is everybody? Hello?

433
00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:46.997
-Guys, we're in here!
-They can't hear you.

434
00:20:47.164 --> 00:20:48.290
Room's soundproof.

435
00:20:48.499 --> 00:20:52.169
And bulletproof. Also, Curt Schilling's
been in here, because I know him.

436
00:20:52.794 --> 00:20:53.795
Hmm.

437
00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.800
I guess they must've gone upstairs.

438
00:20:59.885 --> 00:21:01.178
Look at this fucking thing.

439
00:21:02.137 --> 00:21:04.348
-I feel bad for Ed Jr.
-Mm-hm.

440
00:21:04.515 --> 00:21:06.725
It's one thing if you wanna look
like Admiral Dipshit...

441
00:21:06.892 --> 00:21:09.686
...but then you gotta do it to your kid?
Look at that little:

442
00:21:09.853 --> 00:21:10.896
It's awful.

443
00:21:11.647 --> 00:21:14.900
Got him, like, looking like
Thurston Howell too. "Eh...."

444
00:21:15.067 --> 00:21:17.819
Thanks for coming
to the war room, old chap.

445
00:21:17.986 --> 00:21:22.074
By the way, did I mention that my wife's
vagina never goes above 71% humidity?

446
00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.369
-Um, maybe we should turn this off.
-Not a chance.

447
00:21:25.536 --> 00:21:28.455
What happens
if you lose power during a blow...

448
00:21:28.622 --> 00:21:30.290
...and your main generator drops out?

449
00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:33.669
That's why we had the backup
genny installed in Britney's rumpus.

450
00:21:33.836 --> 00:21:35.712
-Here we go.
-Ah, good show.

451
00:21:35.879 --> 00:21:37.339
-In the rumpus?
-Right inside.

452
00:21:37.548 --> 00:21:39.424
And there's room in there with the stick?

453
00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:41.343
We had to rotate the stick a little.

454
00:21:41.552 --> 00:21:44.054
But then it gives you a little room
to get it up there!

455
00:21:44.221 --> 00:21:46.849
Absolutely.
Can wedge anything in that ass.

456
00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:49.393
Ha-ha-ha. Your English accent's great!

457
00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:50.894
Thank you.

458
00:21:51.061 --> 00:21:52.145
Speaking of installations...

459
00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:54.731
...what about the shiny new set of cans
on Mandy?

460
00:21:54.898 --> 00:21:55.983
-Oh....
-Oh, yeah.

461
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:58.986
Either that or she's buying her T-shirts
at Baby Gap.

462
00:21:59.152 --> 00:22:02.239
-I don't get the whole fake-boob thing.
-What don't you get?

463
00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:05.325
I like my bongos with a little mileage
on them, like Britney's.

464
00:22:06.702 --> 00:22:08.704
Britney's?
No way, those are like Baja miles.

465
00:22:08.871 --> 00:22:11.290
I like being able to get in there
and smoosh them...

466
00:22:11.456 --> 00:22:14.418
...hump them, Stretch Armstrong,
just bibbety-bap them all around.

467
00:22:14.585 --> 00:22:15.586
Okay. All right.

468
00:22:15.752 --> 00:22:18.255
But what about the correlation
between floppy boobs...

469
00:22:18.422 --> 00:22:19.673
...and large-mouth vaginas?

470
00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:20.883
Okay.

471
00:22:21.049 --> 00:22:24.094
You look down there, it's like,
"Hey, I'm Billy Big-mouth vagina."

472
00:22:24.261 --> 00:22:26.471
Home, home on the range

473
00:22:26.638 --> 00:22:29.641
Where the big-mouth vaginas
Feel strange

474
00:22:29.808 --> 00:22:31.977
-Where nothing is good
-Shh, shh, shh.

475
00:22:32.477 --> 00:22:34.646
And it can't fit your wood

476
00:22:34.897 --> 00:22:35.898
You know what I mean.

477
00:22:36.106 --> 00:22:37.608
Oh, relax. Come on, they can't hear us.

478
00:22:41.445 --> 00:22:44.740
You people are horrible! Horrible!

479
00:22:44.907 --> 00:22:47.117
Very disappointed, gentlemen.
Very disappointed.

480
00:22:54.625 --> 00:22:57.711
Hey, anyone thinking chocolate-chip
cookie dough in a waffle cone?

481
00:23:01.131 --> 00:23:02.549
Large-mouth vaginas?

482
00:23:04.259 --> 00:23:05.511
You thought that was funny?

483
00:23:06.136 --> 00:23:07.137
No.

484
00:23:07.304 --> 00:23:09.973
Really? You were laughing like a hyena
when he said it.

485
00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.727
Well, I was embarrassed for Fred,
to be honest. It was uncomfortable.

486
00:23:13.894 --> 00:23:15.562
What the hell is wrong with you two?

487
00:23:15.729 --> 00:23:17.940
You are completely obsessed with sex.

488
00:23:18.106 --> 00:23:21.026
Honey, obsessed is a very strong word.

489
00:23:21.193 --> 00:23:24.947
Oh, yeah? This morning you left the
computer on CockGobblers.com.

490
00:23:27.115 --> 00:23:30.202
I get my weather from that site.

491
00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:34.665
You know what really bothers me?

492
00:23:34.832 --> 00:23:39.086
This thing that you're all so obsessed
with is completely meaningless to you.

493
00:23:39.253 --> 00:23:42.381
Rick, you can't even tell me the month
that you lost your virginity.

494
00:23:42.548 --> 00:23:45.300
I can tell you the exact day and hour
that I lost mine.

495
00:23:46.134 --> 00:23:49.221
Well, honey, virginity's different for guys.

496
00:23:49.429 --> 00:23:53.058
The point is, I like sex too.
It means something to me.

497
00:23:53.225 --> 00:23:56.395
But that doesn't mean that I'm out
gawking at every guy I see.

498
00:23:56.562 --> 00:23:59.523
Okay, so I occasionally notice
other women. I'm sorry.

499
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:00.732
Occasionally?

500
00:24:00.899 --> 00:24:03.861
Driving in a car with you is like being
with a horny bobblehead.

501
00:24:04.027 --> 00:24:07.489
I notice women. I notice all women.
I do. And you wanna know why?

502
00:24:07.698 --> 00:24:11.076
-It's because of the way guys are wired.
-Oh, come on. Give me a break.

503
00:24:11.118 --> 00:24:13.162
It's true. It's just the way it is.

504
00:24:13.162 --> 00:24:15.622
It's not the way you think.
It's more like a curse.

505
00:24:15.622 --> 00:24:17.291
It's something you can't help.

506
00:24:17.332 --> 00:24:20.294
I thought when we got married
that it would stop, but it doesn't stop.

507
00:24:20.294 --> 00:24:22.087
It's just-- It's there.

508
00:24:22.254 --> 00:24:24.006
I'm giving you a hall pass.

509
00:24:24.214 --> 00:24:26.592
-A What?
-One week off from marriage.

510
00:24:27.217 --> 00:24:31.096
What, like a trial separation?
You are seriously overreacting.

511
00:24:31.263 --> 00:24:34.391
No, it's not a separation,
it's a hall pass.

512
00:24:34.558 --> 00:24:37.144
You can do whatever you want.
Get it out of your system.

513
00:24:37.311 --> 00:24:38.937
Wait a second, are you for real?

514
00:24:39.104 --> 00:24:41.356
Rick, this isn't something that I just....

515
00:24:42.107 --> 00:24:44.568
I think that you need this.
I think we need this.

516
00:24:44.735 --> 00:24:46.403
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

517
00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:49.072
It's not a yes-or-no offer,
and it's not a debate.

518
00:24:49.239 --> 00:24:52.534
Tomorrow morning I'm taking the kids
to my parents' Cape house.

519
00:24:52.701 --> 00:24:54.411
We'll be back next Sunday.

520
00:24:54.578 --> 00:24:56.830
Oh, great. So, what am I supposed to do?

521
00:24:58.916 --> 00:25:00.375
Whatever you want.

522
00:25:00.542 --> 00:25:04.379
As far as I'm concerned,
you have the week off from marriage.

523
00:25:08.926 --> 00:25:11.720
They've just added this porch.

524
00:25:11.887 --> 00:25:14.556
There's also a jogging path
right by the river.

525
00:25:14.723 --> 00:25:17.267
But also, what they've just put in
is a new bike trail--

526
00:25:17.434 --> 00:25:20.896
-Hello.
-Hey. Oh. What are you doing here?

527
00:25:21.104 --> 00:25:24.441
I called the office, they said you
were in the neighborhood. Nice place.

528
00:25:24.608 --> 00:25:27.486
This is my friend Fred. Fred,
say hello to Harold and Marcy Goldberg.

529
00:25:27.569 --> 00:25:29.446
They're just moving up from Long Island.

530
00:25:29.488 --> 00:25:31.865
Oh, mazeltov, folks. How are you?

531
00:25:31.907 --> 00:25:33.742
-You know what, let me give you a card.
-No, no, no.

532
00:25:33.742 --> 00:25:35.661
If you need any home, auto, life insurance.

533
00:25:35.786 --> 00:25:38.997
-Kind of the go-to mensch here in town.
-We're okay with insurance.

534
00:25:39.164 --> 00:25:42.251
That's what they all say until they
drop dead. Let me give you one.

535
00:25:42.459 --> 00:25:45.087
I don't think anyone's gonna drop dead.
But thanks, Fred.

536
00:25:45.254 --> 00:25:46.755
If you wanna take another look...

537
00:25:46.964 --> 00:25:49.591
...I'll be waiting right here
to answer any questions.

538
00:25:49.758 --> 00:25:52.636
-Thanks. Yeah.
-Ha, ha.

539
00:25:52.803 --> 00:25:55.597
What are you doing, man?
The mazeltov? Give me a break.

540
00:25:55.764 --> 00:25:58.684
-Sorry. You weren't answering your phone.
-No. I'm working.

541
00:25:58.851 --> 00:26:01.478
I just wanna see what
trouble you got into last night.

542
00:26:01.645 --> 00:26:03.438
-You know what Grace made me do?
-What?

543
00:26:03.605 --> 00:26:06.400
She drove me there to apologize.
Did Maggie give you grief...

544
00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:07.776
...when you got back home?

545
00:26:07.943 --> 00:26:09.194
-Kind of.
-Yeah?

546
00:26:11.738 --> 00:26:13.115
What happened?

547
00:26:13.282 --> 00:26:15.450
She gave me a hall pass.

548
00:26:15.659 --> 00:26:16.910
A What?

549
00:26:17.077 --> 00:26:19.621
It's like a week off from marriage.

550
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:21.665
Heh, heh. Yeah, right.

551
00:26:21.832 --> 00:26:24.001
-I'm serious.
-Fuck you.

552
00:26:24.168 --> 00:26:24.960
It's true.

553
00:26:25.085 --> 00:26:25.878
She's taking the kids

554
00:26:25.919 --> 00:26:29.339
and going up to her parents' beach house
till next Sunday.

555
00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:31.466
Wait, I don't get it. What--?

556
00:26:31.675 --> 00:26:33.927
Why aren't you
buying ticker tape for the parade?

557
00:26:34.011 --> 00:26:36.513
-I don't know how I feel about it.
-Feel about what?

558
00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:40.642
The hall pass. I don't-- It just--
Something doesn't seem quite right.

559
00:26:40.851 --> 00:26:43.353
You think Maggie might have
a brain tumor or something?

560
00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.524
No, no. It's like, just because your
wife says it's okay to cheat, is it?

561
00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:48.984
There's a part of me that's like:

562
00:26:49.193 --> 00:26:52.196
"Wow. You must've really pushed her
to get her to this point."

563
00:26:52.362 --> 00:26:55.991
Is that good for a marriage, that she's
willing to try something this insane?

564
00:26:56.074 --> 00:26:58.410
Absolutely. Come on.

565
00:26:58.619 --> 00:26:59.703
Doesn't it ever bother you

566
00:26:59.828 --> 00:27:02.414
that all of our wives' dreams come true
and ours don't?

567
00:27:02.581 --> 00:27:03.790
Look at Maggie, all right?

568
00:27:03.957 --> 00:27:06.168
She used to play house.
You bought her a house.

569
00:27:06.376 --> 00:27:09.505
She used to play with a Easy-Bake Oven.
You bought her a Viking.

570
00:27:09.713 --> 00:27:11.882
She wanted to be a mommy,
you made her a mommy.

571
00:27:12.049 --> 00:27:13.008
-GE.
-What GE?

572
00:27:13.091 --> 00:27:14.426
The oven's a GE.

573
00:27:14.551 --> 00:27:16.345
It doesn't matter,
you're not trying to sell anyway.

574
00:27:16.386 --> 00:27:17.930
Look at you,
you're not living your dreams.

575
00:27:18.096 --> 00:27:20.432
I don't see you hosting Wheel of Fortune.

576
00:27:20.557 --> 00:27:24.603
Your wife is living her dreams, and now
this woman, this saint of a woman...

577
00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:27.523
...she's giving you the opportunity
to live yours.

578
00:27:31.068 --> 00:27:34.112
Now you watch, this thing's gonna
end up biting Maggie in the ass.

579
00:27:34.279 --> 00:27:37.574
And I gotta admit, I lost a little
respect for Rick for accepting it.

580
00:27:37.741 --> 00:27:39.451
-Well, it wasn't really his choice.
-Mm-hm.

581
00:27:39.618 --> 00:27:41.203
This is really her call, Fred.

582
00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:43.872
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point.

583
00:27:44.039 --> 00:27:45.624
-You know what, maybe you're right.
-Huh.

584
00:27:45.791 --> 00:27:48.043
Maybe this is the progressive,
cool thing to do.

585
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:50.712
Yeah, that's not what I was saying.
I said--

586
00:27:51.088 --> 00:27:54.424
You are not getting a hall pass.
So you can cut the bullshit.

587
00:27:54.591 --> 00:27:55.759
What?

588
00:27:55.926 --> 00:27:59.096
Why would I need a hall pass, huh?
I got you!

589
00:27:59.263 --> 00:28:02.599
well, not tonight, you don't.
I'm bloated and I have cramps.

590
00:28:02.808 --> 00:28:06.353
Ah, shit. I forgot to take out the trash.

591
00:28:09.106 --> 00:28:13.735
Tonight's the night we'll make history

592
00:28:14.111 --> 00:28:19.491
Honey, you and I

593
00:28:20.075 --> 00:28:21.243
'Cause I'll take any risk

594
00:28:22.786 --> 00:28:27.583
To tie back the hands of time

595
00:28:28.584 --> 00:28:35.174
And stay with you here tonight

596
00:28:39.011 --> 00:28:45.392
I know you feel these are the worst of times

597
00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:50.439
I do believe it's true

598
00:28:50.856 --> 00:28:56.278
But I know
If the world just passed us by

599
00:28:56.445 --> 00:28:58.655
Baby, I know

600
00:29:00.324 --> 00:29:02.159
I wouldn't have the time

601
00:29:02.326 --> 00:29:04.119
No, no

602
00:29:04.286 --> 00:29:08.582
The best of times

603
00:29:10.292 --> 00:29:13.962
Okay, ma'am.
If you say he's yours, you can have him.

604
00:29:14.129 --> 00:29:15.839
Thank you, officer.

605
00:29:16.006 --> 00:29:19.343
-Is he going to jail?
-Thank you so much.

606
00:29:22.513 --> 00:29:26.350
What kind of sick prick
jerks off in his front yard?!

607
00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:28.143
I got a hall pass.

608
00:29:29.186 --> 00:29:30.771
What? How?

609
00:29:30.938 --> 00:29:33.774
Well, it doesn't matter how. I got one.

610
00:29:33.941 --> 00:29:35.901
Can you believe it? I got a hall pass.

611
00:29:36.068 --> 00:29:37.611
When does yours begin?

612
00:29:37.778 --> 00:29:39.363
Uh, 24 minutes ago.

613
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.740
Yeah, she's gonna go join Maggie
up at the Cape.

614
00:29:41.907 --> 00:29:44.409
It's just you and me, buddy,
for the next 6 days. Ha, ha.

615
00:29:45.702 --> 00:29:48.622
You realize how much easier this is,
having a hall-pass partner?

616
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:49.873
Yeah. Tell me about it.

617
00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.668
It's not just me.
It's gonna be Gary, Hog-Head, Flats.

618
00:29:52.835 --> 00:29:54.378
They're all coming out with us.

619
00:29:54.545 --> 00:29:56.797
Are you joking?
Those guys got hall passes?

620
00:29:56.964 --> 00:29:59.675
-No, no, no. They just wanna watch.
-Yeah. Watch What?

621
00:29:59.842 --> 00:30:02.803
Watch us reel in the babes. Ha, ha.

622
00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:06.390
That's good, that's good. You remember
how we dominated in JV basketball?

623
00:30:06.557 --> 00:30:07.599
Yeah, senior year.

624
00:30:07.766 --> 00:30:11.562
But that one game where we had a couple
fans in the stands, we played even better.

625
00:30:11.728 --> 00:30:14.982
-we're a couple of show ponies, aren't we?
-Yeah, we came alive!

626
00:30:15.148 --> 00:30:17.609
We gotta get out of here,
we're burning daylight.

627
00:30:17.776 --> 00:30:19.236
-Let me log out.
-You log out.

628
00:30:19.403 --> 00:30:22.489
-I'm gonna try to bang your receptionist.
-No, no, no! Fred. Fred.

629
00:30:22.656 --> 00:30:24.074
Let's keep the office clean.

630
00:30:24.241 --> 00:30:26.076
Wait till we hit the streets.

631
00:30:26.243 --> 00:30:27.870
Class act.

632
00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.570
This place is dead.

633
00:31:01.778 --> 00:31:05.908
Okay, well, the guy at the Comfy Nite Inn
said it doesn't really kick in till about 9:30.

634
00:31:06.116 --> 00:31:07.117
All right.

635
00:31:07.284 --> 00:31:09.286
Why are you guys staying at a hotel?

636
00:31:09.453 --> 00:31:13.582
Well, come on, Flats, I can't very well
bring a bunch of models back to my place.

637
00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:15.501
What if they end up stalking me?

638
00:31:15.667 --> 00:31:18.086
And Rick's house
has got a bunch of family photos...

639
00:31:18.253 --> 00:31:20.422
...and kids' drawings on the fridge,
you know?

640
00:31:20.631 --> 00:31:23.800
It ain't exactly an aphrodisiac for babes.

641
00:31:23.967 --> 00:31:25.177
Doesn't make boners.

642
00:31:25.344 --> 00:31:28.514
Hey, hey, talking of babes,
which one have you got your eyes on?

643
00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.724
-Come on, who are you gonna bone first?
-Uh....

644
00:31:31.183 --> 00:31:34.144
Hey, hey, hey. What about those two?
Why don't you go bang them?

645
00:31:34.311 --> 00:31:37.356
Or maybe the hostess. Someone
should definitely jump her bones.

646
00:31:37.523 --> 00:31:39.233
Guys, attempt to be cool.

647
00:31:39.399 --> 00:31:41.318
You know, we've got
the whole week, so....

648
00:31:41.485 --> 00:31:43.195
We'll get there, we'll get there.

649
00:31:43.403 --> 00:31:46.532
Are you guys sure Applebee's is the best
place to meet horny women?

650
00:31:46.698 --> 00:31:48.742
What are you thinking, Olive Garden?

651
00:31:48.909 --> 00:31:50.994
What do you want,
hot pussy or breadsticks?

652
00:31:51.161 --> 00:31:53.372
Wait a second, wait. Where's Coakley?

653
00:31:53.539 --> 00:31:56.041
-That's where we should be.
-Yeah. He's in Iceland.

654
00:31:56.208 --> 00:31:57.626
Why? What's he doing there?

655
00:31:57.793 --> 00:32:00.963
What do you think? Iceland has
the most beautiful women in the world.

656
00:32:01.171 --> 00:32:02.381
Yeah. Bj�rk.

657
00:32:02.548 --> 00:32:05.551
Okay, look. I'm taking the bull
by the horns right now, okay?

658
00:32:05.968 --> 00:32:07.845
You guys want beautiful women, right?

659
00:32:08.011 --> 00:32:09.847
I know a place that got ass on tap!

660
00:32:10.013 --> 00:32:13.141
Okay? And it's not Applebee's.
And it's not Olive Garden.

661
00:32:13.308 --> 00:32:14.309
Let's roll, baby.

662
00:32:14.518 --> 00:32:17.312
-Follow me, fellas, for some ass.
-Good. Okay. I like it.

663
00:32:17.479 --> 00:32:20.148
A man with a plan.
Okay. Where we going?

664
00:32:20.357 --> 00:32:21.483
Chili's.

665
00:32:21.650 --> 00:32:22.860
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

666
00:32:23.026 --> 00:32:25.821
Before we go bagging chicks,
I need a hunk of beef inside me.

667
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:28.824
You're not gonna get a better
hunk of beef than you get here.

668
00:32:28.991 --> 00:32:30.159
That's true. That's true.

669
00:32:30.325 --> 00:32:33.370
Look, we got a long night ahead of us.
Why don't we go fuel up?

670
00:32:35.664 --> 00:32:39.168
Okay, where to now?

671
00:32:40.961 --> 00:32:42.379
-Rick?
-Hmm?

672
00:32:42.588 --> 00:32:44.423
-Answer Flats.
-What's the question?

673
00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:47.676
What the hell are we doing for the rest
of the night?

674
00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.387
-We're gonna get laid, right?
-Yeah.

675
00:32:50.554 --> 00:32:52.389
Is that the plan? Yeah.

676
00:32:52.931 --> 00:32:55.559
I gotta go home and poo.

677
00:32:56.059 --> 00:32:57.728
Now?

678
00:32:57.895 --> 00:32:59.396
Why don't you just back one out here?

679
00:32:59.563 --> 00:33:02.191
Ooh, I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need
a bath afterwards.

680
00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:05.444
Come on, guys! All right, listen,
I say we go to a titty bar, yeah?

681
00:33:05.611 --> 00:33:08.405
Where there's tits, and we look at them,
and we smoke cigars.

682
00:33:08.572 --> 00:33:12.034
-That'll put a bit of lead back in the pencil.
-I got a better idea.

683
00:33:12.201 --> 00:33:15.370
I say we, uh, tie a bow on it
and put her to bed.

684
00:33:15.579 --> 00:33:18.582
It's gonna be a long week.
I think we need to pace ourselves.

685
00:33:18.749 --> 00:33:20.876
What? It's only 9:15.

686
00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:24.421
Mm. No, I'm with Rico. Freddie tie-tie.

687
00:33:24.588 --> 00:33:25.631
Oh, come on!

688
00:33:25.797 --> 00:33:28.884
Guys, guys, relax. This is just the calm
before the storm.

689
00:33:29.092 --> 00:33:33.764
That's right, that's right. Tonight we build
up some strength, and then tomorrow, pfft...

690
00:33:35.182 --> 00:33:36.600
...make landfall.

691
00:33:40.354 --> 00:33:43.023
This resort sure beats
the hell out of the Comfy Nite Inn.

692
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:45.442
-Why aren't you guys staying here?
-Too pricey.

693
00:33:45.609 --> 00:33:49.863
Besides, if you pay for golf you get full
access to the resort, including the pool bar.

694
00:33:50.030 --> 00:33:51.740
-Oh!
-Not bad, yeah?

695
00:33:51.949 --> 00:33:54.785
Mothers, lock up your daughters.
The dogs are off the leash.

696
00:33:54.952 --> 00:33:56.995
Gentlemen, look what I got here.

697
00:33:57.162 --> 00:33:58.205
What are those?

698
00:33:58.372 --> 00:33:59.832
Oh, just some brownies...

699
00:33:59.998 --> 00:34:01.500
-...of the pot variety.
-Whoa.

700
00:34:01.667 --> 00:34:03.585
-What?
-We're not on spring break.

701
00:34:03.752 --> 00:34:06.421
-Where'd you get those?
-From the guy who cleans my office.

702
00:34:06.630 --> 00:34:08.882
-Come on, who's in?
-Ehh. Ahh....

703
00:34:09.341 --> 00:34:10.801
No.

704
00:34:11.134 --> 00:34:12.594
Come on, you squares.

705
00:34:12.761 --> 00:34:14.513
It's not the same as when you smoke it.

706
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.350
When you eat it, it's a much more mellow
buzz. Makes you feel sort of relaxed.

707
00:34:18.684 --> 00:34:20.727
-Are they chocolatey?
-Yeah.

708
00:34:20.894 --> 00:34:23.939
You know what, Rick?
This is spring break.

709
00:34:24.106 --> 00:34:25.732
You guys got a hall pass.

710
00:34:25.899 --> 00:34:27.192
You need to live it up.

711
00:34:27.359 --> 00:34:29.736
Might help your rap with the ladies at
the pool later.

712
00:34:29.903 --> 00:34:33.031
-Ha, ha. Correct.
-You don't even have a hall pass.

713
00:34:33.198 --> 00:34:35.284
So? I can live vicariously
through you guys.

714
00:34:35.492 --> 00:34:38.328
It's not vicarious if you're
actually doing it, Hog-Head.

715
00:34:38.495 --> 00:34:40.622
Get off my back.
I'm just trying to enjoy a pastry here.

716
00:34:41.999 --> 00:34:43.041
Oh, what the hell.

717
00:34:43.208 --> 00:34:45.836
It's not like my game
could get any worse.

718
00:34:48.213 --> 00:34:49.840
-Come on.
-Do it.

719
00:34:50.007 --> 00:34:52.801
-All right, give me one of those things.
-Hee-hee.

720
00:34:54.052 --> 00:34:55.304
It's a bit naughty.

721
00:35:03.187 --> 00:35:04.688
Hurry up!

722
00:35:04.855 --> 00:35:07.149
What kind of soap do you use?

723
00:35:07.482 --> 00:35:09.318
-In the shower?
-Yeah.

724
00:35:09.526 --> 00:35:11.153
What's the matter with you?

725
00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:12.988
-Dove.
-I like Dove.

726
00:35:13.822 --> 00:35:16.325
I like it, it doesn't dry your skin out
so much.

727
00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:18.952
-Play through!
-Play through.

728
00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:20.829
Feel this.

729
00:35:22.873 --> 00:35:24.708
-That is so soft.
-Yeah.

730
00:35:24.875 --> 00:35:27.878
Golly, that is soft.
Hey, Hog-Head, come here, man.

731
00:35:28.045 --> 00:35:30.380
You gotta feel Rick's skin,
feel how soft it is.

732
00:35:30.547 --> 00:35:33.050
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Hog-Ass, you okay?

733
00:35:34.635 --> 00:35:36.053
What the hell is he doing?

734
00:35:37.429 --> 00:35:39.097
He's got back spasms.

735
00:35:39.264 --> 00:35:42.226
-Not him. Him.
-No, they were delicious.

736
00:35:42.392 --> 00:35:45.896
-Think your mother would give the recipe?
-Gary! what are you doing?

737
00:35:46.355 --> 00:35:49.024
I'm talking to the guy
who cleans my office!

738
00:35:49.191 --> 00:35:51.068
He says we took way too much!

739
00:35:51.235 --> 00:35:53.946
We're only supposed to eat,
like, a quarter of a brownie each!

740
00:35:55.781 --> 00:35:56.824
What?

741
00:35:56.990 --> 00:36:01.328
Look, this is the third time I've had to flag
your group, and you're on the 4th hole.

742
00:36:02.037 --> 00:36:04.540
Now, if I have to come out here again,
you're done.

743
00:36:04.706 --> 00:36:06.291
-Sorry, we're gonna pick it up.
-Ha, ha.

744
00:36:06.458 --> 00:36:07.626
I'll see you, Jorge.

745
00:36:11.505 --> 00:36:13.298
Where was the last place you saw it?

746
00:36:13.465 --> 00:36:17.427
On one of the fairways. I grabbed a club,
took a swing, looked around, gone.

747
00:36:17.594 --> 00:36:18.720
-Vanished?
-Yes.

748
00:36:18.887 --> 00:36:20.138
Dude, where's my golf cart?

749
00:36:20.305 --> 00:36:21.807
-Not funny.
-Fred, knock it off.

750
00:36:21.974 --> 00:36:23.767
Hey, guys, I need to take a poo.

751
00:36:23.934 --> 00:36:25.185
Give us a second here.

752
00:36:25.352 --> 00:36:26.770
I think it's been stolen.

753
00:36:26.937 --> 00:36:29.189
-Who's gonna steal a golf cart?
-Criminals.

754
00:36:29.356 --> 00:36:32.568
-It's probably jacked up on bricks now.
-Gary, you're being paranoid.

755
00:36:32.734 --> 00:36:35.946
-I'll tell you this. I do remember this.
-what's up with this shit?

756
00:36:36.113 --> 00:36:38.490
I saw it on the 11th tee.
That's the last I saw it.

757
00:36:38.657 --> 00:36:40.617
-We're on the sixth hole.
-They're cutting.

758
00:36:40.784 --> 00:36:42.077
Did we skip five holes?

759
00:36:42.286 --> 00:36:43.704
Shit, where are my kids?

760
00:36:43.871 --> 00:36:45.497
Anybody have any napkins?

761
00:36:46.165 --> 00:36:47.541
Come on, man!

762
00:36:47.749 --> 00:36:50.502
We're getting cut on
by the Joy Luck Club.

763
00:36:52.421 --> 00:36:53.547
Nobody cares about this?

764
00:36:53.714 --> 00:36:55.549
-Is that the marshal?
-Should we say something?

765
00:36:56.925 --> 00:36:58.594
Cops! Run for it! Cutters!

766
00:37:07.644 --> 00:37:11.231
Whoa. Oh....

767
00:37:11.398 --> 00:37:13.692
-Speed up, speed up!
-I can't! I've got it floored!

768
00:37:15.068 --> 00:37:16.487
Well, cut through the woods!

769
00:37:19.698 --> 00:37:21.533
-Come on!
-Come on! Come on!

770
00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.327
-Hurry!
-Hurry!

771
00:37:23.494 --> 00:37:25.913
-Go! Go! Go!
-Come on!

772
00:37:31.335 --> 00:37:32.878
Go, go, go!

773
00:37:45.724 --> 00:37:47.809
Ed. Britney.

774
00:37:48.018 --> 00:37:49.811
Clones.

775
00:37:59.530 --> 00:38:03.700
-Strike!
-Hey, ump! You're missing a hell of a game!

776
00:38:03.867 --> 00:38:05.869
Let's go. Come on, batter up. Let's go.

777
00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:08.664
Little hit. Little hit. Let's go, Gerry.

778
00:38:14.545 --> 00:38:15.546
Go, go, go!

779
00:38:16.129 --> 00:38:17.714
Safe!

780
00:38:19.216 --> 00:38:20.926
I don't know how you can be so calm...

781
00:38:21.093 --> 00:38:23.679
...knowing our husbands are out
chasing tail all over town.

782
00:38:23.887 --> 00:38:25.806
Shh, keep it down.

783
00:38:25.973 --> 00:38:27.891
Relax. Here's how I see it:

784
00:38:28.058 --> 00:38:31.186
Rick and Fred are like a couple of
domesticated cats scratching at the door.

785
00:38:31.353 --> 00:38:33.647
-Ha, ha.
-The first time you let them out...

786
00:38:33.856 --> 00:38:36.859
...they are so paralyzed with fear
they bolt back into the house.

787
00:38:37.025 --> 00:38:39.903
Okay, but we're not talking about
cats here. We are talking about dogs.

788
00:38:40.070 --> 00:38:41.947
Ha, ha. Well, what choice do we have?

789
00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:45.409
I don't know. I mean, why couldn't we
just keep the status quo?

790
00:38:45.576 --> 00:38:48.537
Were things that bad that we have
to do something this extreme?

791
00:38:48.704 --> 00:38:50.205
For me they were.

792
00:38:50.747 --> 00:38:52.749
Remember when we went
to Lucy's award thing?

793
00:38:52.916 --> 00:38:55.502
-Yeah.
-Well, that night Rick and I were gonna...

794
00:38:55.669 --> 00:38:56.712
-...you know.
-Yeah.

795
00:38:56.920 --> 00:39:00.549
I started wondering, who is he gonna
be thinking about when we're having sex?

796
00:39:00.716 --> 00:39:03.093
Is it gonna be that girl
that he checked out...

797
00:39:03.260 --> 00:39:06.513
...or is it gonna be somebody
he met that day or Missy Frankinopoulos?

798
00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:11.143
Or some Frankinopoulos monster where he
combines his favorite parts of all of them?

799
00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.854
-So when he came into the room....
-What?

800
00:39:14.021 --> 00:39:16.440
I pretended to be asleep.

801
00:39:17.816 --> 00:39:20.402
You're kidding. You don't--
You've never done that before?

802
00:39:20.611 --> 00:39:21.820
I do that all the time.

803
00:39:21.987 --> 00:39:23.614
-Really?
-Yes.

804
00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:27.284
I think it's our job as women that
between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m...

805
00:39:27.451 --> 00:39:28.785
...we just fake everything.

806
00:39:28.952 --> 00:39:31.455
-Ha, ha. Well, I don't know. I--
-Hey.

807
00:39:32.414 --> 00:39:34.666
I'm Gerry.
Thanks for coming out to support us.

808
00:39:34.833 --> 00:39:36.793
Yeah. That was so much fun.

809
00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.795
-Go Falmouth. Ha, ha.
-Ha, ha.

810
00:39:38.962 --> 00:39:40.005
Thanks.

811
00:39:40.172 --> 00:39:43.634
So we saw you guys sitting up there with
those kids. Are you nannies or something?

812
00:39:45.552 --> 00:39:47.387
No. Those are my kids.

813
00:39:47.554 --> 00:39:48.597
They're her kids.

814
00:39:48.805 --> 00:39:50.265
I'm not old enough to have kids.

815
00:39:51.308 --> 00:39:54.144
Come on. Guys, come on, let's go.
Let's pick it up.

816
00:39:54.311 --> 00:39:55.812
-What am I, your slave?
-See you.

817
00:39:55.979 --> 00:39:58.649
Pick up your own balls and bats!
Move your ass!

818
00:39:58.815 --> 00:40:00.526
-Thank you, Eddie.
-Ha, ha. Hey, Dad.

819
00:40:00.692 --> 00:40:02.569
Maggie, Grace.
Rick Coleman, my golf buddy.

820
00:40:02.736 --> 00:40:04.655
-He's the coach.
-Hey. Hi.

821
00:40:05.155 --> 00:40:06.949
Hope those clowns
weren't bothering you.

822
00:40:07.157 --> 00:40:10.410
-Oh, no, they were sweet.
-Yeah. No, no. Those were cute kids.

823
00:40:10.577 --> 00:40:13.539
We're going to the players' digs for
beer and brats. Join us?

824
00:40:13.997 --> 00:40:17.167
-Yeah.
-No. We have to get the kids home.

825
00:40:17.334 --> 00:40:20.420
Go. Go have some fun.
You haven't been out all week.

826
00:40:20.587 --> 00:40:23.382
Your mother and I have the kids.
We've got Paige. No problem.

827
00:40:23.549 --> 00:40:27.010
-I don't know. We weren't planning on--
-Come on. It's gonna be fun.

828
00:40:27.177 --> 00:40:30.097
We're gonna have a belly-flop contest
in the pool. You all can be judges.

829
00:40:30.264 --> 00:40:31.598
-Ha, ha. Uh--
-We're in.

830
00:40:31.765 --> 00:40:34.518
Great. Let me clean up
and you can follow me over.

831
00:40:34.685 --> 00:40:37.938
-Great.
-I'll go round up the kids.

832
00:40:38.355 --> 00:40:39.773
-What are you doing?
-Huh?

833
00:40:39.982 --> 00:40:44.278
Those guys are still in college.
And in case you forgot, we're married.

834
00:40:44.444 --> 00:40:48.198
Uh, to who? Because you know What?
The last that I checked...

835
00:40:48.365 --> 00:40:50.826
...Rick and Fred had the week off
from marriage...

836
00:40:50.993 --> 00:40:54.037
...so remind me again,
who are we married to?

837
00:40:56.999 --> 00:40:59.626
Well, I guess one beer won't kill us.

838
00:40:59.793 --> 00:41:01.336
Now, that's my girl.

839
00:41:01.545 --> 00:41:05.090
Come on, why can't we have some fun?
God knows our guys are living it up.

840
00:41:05.382 --> 00:41:08.218
What would you rather?
Make out with a guy or let him blow you?

841
00:41:08.385 --> 00:41:11.513
And you gotta pick one or your
whole family will die. That's the rule.

842
00:41:11.722 --> 00:41:13.140
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

843
00:41:13.307 --> 00:41:15.392
-How long would you have to make out?
-Ten minutes.

844
00:41:15.559 --> 00:41:17.102
-Tongue?
-Of course.

845
00:41:17.269 --> 00:41:19.021
How long would you have to
let him blow you?

846
00:41:19.229 --> 00:41:20.606
-Seven minutes.
-Seven?

847
00:41:20.772 --> 00:41:22.065
Couldn't last seven minutes.

848
00:41:22.232 --> 00:41:26.069
This is tricky because, obviously, getting
a blow job from a guy, you know, is bad...

849
00:41:26.236 --> 00:41:27.821
-...but I don't know.
-Oh.

850
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:30.574
Making out with him
is just so intimate, isn't it?

851
00:41:30.741 --> 00:41:33.076
What does he do for a living,
just out of interest?

852
00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:37.080
Okay, look. This is some bullshit,
okay? I'm out of here, man.

853
00:41:37.247 --> 00:41:40.626
I wanted to watch you guys pick up
chicks, not talk about dicks.

854
00:41:40.792 --> 00:41:45.506
Whoa. Greased Lightning, take your foot
off the gas. These things take time.

855
00:41:45.672 --> 00:41:49.384
Nah, Flats is right. This is day three.
You guys haven't even talked to a girl.

856
00:41:49.593 --> 00:41:51.762
That's not true.
Thanks to Gary's brownies...

857
00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:55.224
...I was talking to Judy on the drug
hotline most of last night.

858
00:41:55.432 --> 00:41:58.644
I'm gonna get going as well, guys.
See you later.

859
00:41:59.186 --> 00:42:01.230
Guys, it's all right if you strike out.

860
00:42:01.438 --> 00:42:05.067
For God's sakes,
at least take a couple of swings.

861
00:42:13.784 --> 00:42:17.746
Maybe we should just call the girls,
ask them to come home.

862
00:42:18.956 --> 00:42:20.749
Wait a second, you wanna quit?

863
00:42:21.166 --> 00:42:25.379
Fred, come on. We're not the same guys
we were 15 years ago when we were single.

864
00:42:25.546 --> 00:42:26.588
We've changed.

865
00:42:27.965 --> 00:42:31.051
No. No, you've changed.
All you're thinking about is yourself.

866
00:42:31.218 --> 00:42:32.928
I don't care. I'm exhausted.
I wanna go home.

867
00:42:34.471 --> 00:42:36.223
-I miss my wife and kids, okay?
-No.

868
00:42:36.390 --> 00:42:41.019
No, no, no.
Let me explain something to you, okay?

869
00:42:41.186 --> 00:42:44.273
If Maggie and Grace find out that we
can't get laid on our own...

870
00:42:44.481 --> 00:42:46.984
...they'll start thinking that we need
them to get laid.

871
00:42:47.151 --> 00:42:50.154
Do you realize what that'll do to the
balance of power in our homes? Do you?

872
00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:52.030
Ahh. Yeah.

873
00:42:52.322 --> 00:42:54.366
Maybe we just say that we did hook up.

874
00:42:54.533 --> 00:42:57.786
I can't. Grace will know I'm lying.
She always knows when I'm lying.

875
00:42:57.995 --> 00:42:59.288
And she doesn't forget.

876
00:42:59.496 --> 00:43:02.875
I once got caught giving her fake chow
and I didn't hear the end of it for years.

877
00:43:03.041 --> 00:43:05.794
-What's fake chow?
-When you're going south on them...

878
00:43:06.003 --> 00:43:08.922
...and don't wanna use your tongue,
so you use fingers and smack your lips.

879
00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:12.426
-Fake chow.
-Gotcha.

880
00:43:12.843 --> 00:43:16.096
-What if we hit a massage parlor?
-No way. That is giving up.

881
00:43:16.263 --> 00:43:17.556
You don't get it, do you?

882
00:43:17.723 --> 00:43:20.976
If we can't show something positive
can come from having a hall pass...

883
00:43:21.185 --> 00:43:22.853
...then the whole concept is dead.

884
00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:25.522
Not just for you and me,
but for all mankind.

885
00:43:29.067 --> 00:43:32.279
Okay, let's get out of here.
I know exactly where we should be.

886
00:43:32.446 --> 00:43:33.989
Here we go.

887
00:43:35.532 --> 00:43:37.242
Hey, what's with the helmet?

888
00:43:37.409 --> 00:43:40.245
Oh, chicks dig motorcycles. Come on.

889
00:43:46.752 --> 00:43:48.462
Hi, everybody.

890
00:43:50.464 --> 00:43:52.382
This is Stella Bass Band.

891
00:43:54.092 --> 00:43:56.136
We're here to tighten it up for you.

892
00:43:57.387 --> 00:44:00.933
First we want willie to tighten it up.

893
00:44:01.099 --> 00:44:02.142
What's that?

894
00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:06.313
I went online earlier this afternoon, got a
few pick-up lines to get the ball rolling.

895
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:10.192
"You must be from lreland because
when I look at you my penis is Dublin."

896
00:44:11.777 --> 00:44:14.822
You know What? I don't think
we need any phony pick-up lines.

897
00:44:14.988 --> 00:44:17.115
I think we can just be our natural selves.

898
00:44:17.282 --> 00:44:19.493
-Great, yeah. If you know how to.
-Oh, yeah.

899
00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:21.537
-Give me the helmet.
-Mm-hm.

900
00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.541
And right now,
there's a lot of people without jobs.

901
00:44:25.707 --> 00:44:27.918
So, you know, just suck it up.
This is gonna--

902
00:44:29.336 --> 00:44:30.963
Hello.

903
00:44:31.129 --> 00:44:32.214
-Hello.
-Hi.

904
00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:33.882
Hola.

905
00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:42.015
Wow. This is awkward. I feel like I'm at
my first junior-high mixer. You know?

906
00:44:42.224 --> 00:44:44.601
-When you don't know what to say.
-Ha, ha.

907
00:44:46.353 --> 00:44:50.274
Um, so are you women
from lreland perchance?

908
00:44:51.608 --> 00:44:53.110
-No.
-Really?

909
00:44:53.277 --> 00:44:55.362
Oh. I'm very surprised
to hear that news...

910
00:44:55.529 --> 00:44:59.449
...because when I look at you,
my wiener doubles in size.

911
00:44:59.825 --> 00:45:03.370
Oh, no, no, no.
He means that his penis is Dublin.

912
00:45:03.537 --> 00:45:04.955
Like the city in lreland.

913
00:45:05.122 --> 00:45:06.123
It's doubling.

914
00:45:13.797 --> 00:45:15.632
How about you, Rick? You have any kids?

915
00:45:15.799 --> 00:45:19.761
I really don't like kids. They're too needy.
Plus, it's smart to get married...

916
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:23.599
...if you're gonna have kids, and women
only like me for three months at a time.

917
00:45:24.975 --> 00:45:27.477
-Aah!
-That's what you get.

918
00:45:27.644 --> 00:45:30.063
How about you?
How long you been off the market?

919
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:32.900
-Over 20 years if you include dating.
-Whoa.

920
00:45:33.066 --> 00:45:35.611
We started going out
when I was a freshman in college.

921
00:45:35.819 --> 00:45:38.197
-And where is he?
-Um....

922
00:45:39.573 --> 00:45:41.408
He's back in Providence.

923
00:45:41.825 --> 00:45:43.452
Poor guy. All work and no play, huh?

924
00:45:46.038 --> 00:45:47.998
Yeah, something like that.

925
00:45:52.544 --> 00:45:54.505
Do you know how much
a polar bear weighs?

926
00:45:54.671 --> 00:45:55.756
No, how much?

927
00:45:55.923 --> 00:45:57.799
Enough to break the ice.
Hi, Fred Searing.

928
00:45:57.966 --> 00:45:59.843
Would you like
to try the Australian kiss?

929
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.221
It's like the French kiss
except down under.

930
00:46:03.597 --> 00:46:06.642
Excuse me? Do you think these bar
napkins smell like chloroform?

931
00:46:06.934 --> 00:46:09.186
I'm kidding. Fred Searing.
Can I buy you a drink?

932
00:46:12.523 --> 00:46:15.776
I feel like donkey-kicking everyone
in this bar. This is unbelievable.

933
00:46:15.943 --> 00:46:19.780
Hey. Hey, hey, keep your chin up, okay?
No one said this was gonna be easy.

934
00:46:19.947 --> 00:46:22.616
Even in college it took 50 rejections
for every one score.

935
00:46:22.783 --> 00:46:23.826
Yeah, yeah.

936
00:46:23.992 --> 00:46:26.495
Of course, it didn't sting as much
when you were drunk.

937
00:46:26.703 --> 00:46:29.289
That's what we should do, then.
We should get drunk.

938
00:46:29.456 --> 00:46:31.291
-You're right, we're too stiff.
-I know.

939
00:46:31.458 --> 00:46:33.252
Let's get the creative juices flowing.

940
00:46:33.418 --> 00:46:35.003
Let the soul come to the surface.

941
00:46:35.212 --> 00:46:37.005
That's when we're at our most charming.

942
00:46:37.214 --> 00:46:39.091
You say no to me?

943
00:46:39.383 --> 00:46:42.594
You say no to me? No, no, no.
Flip it!

944
00:46:42.761 --> 00:46:44.429
I say no to you!

945
00:46:44.596 --> 00:46:47.558
-Come on, let's go, baby. It's time to go.
-Oh, screw you!

946
00:46:47.724 --> 00:46:50.310
Look, hey,
you think your shit don't float?

947
00:46:50.477 --> 00:46:55.232
Let me tell you something. I wouldn't
titty-bang any of you in a snowstorm.

948
00:46:55.399 --> 00:46:57.442
-Come on, please?
-No!

949
00:46:57.609 --> 00:46:59.695
-You had your shot and you blew it!
-Come on.

950
00:46:59.862 --> 00:47:02.239
-Goodbye!
-You are the man tonight.

951
00:47:02.406 --> 00:47:06.034
Oh, hey! Betsy Ross!
You need a pole for that flag?

952
00:47:08.495 --> 00:47:11.081
Aw, what's the matter?
You can't get any bigger, you little bitch?

953
00:47:32.436 --> 00:47:33.729
Yeah!

954
00:47:42.237 --> 00:47:43.614
Go, go, go!

955
00:47:45.491 --> 00:47:46.533
Yeah!

956
00:47:57.044 --> 00:47:58.712
-Hi.
-Hi. Can I take your order?

957
00:48:00.839 --> 00:48:02.549
I'm not quite sure what I'm gonna get.

958
00:48:02.758 --> 00:48:05.177
Um, hmm.

959
00:48:08.263 --> 00:48:10.766
Hoo. Um....

960
00:48:10.933 --> 00:48:13.894
So just tell me today

961
00:48:14.061 --> 00:48:17.147
Um, hey, man, do you mind
if she takes my order?

962
00:48:19.483 --> 00:48:20.609
Why?

963
00:48:20.776 --> 00:48:22.903
Well, just.... You know, because....

964
00:48:23.946 --> 00:48:24.988
Because she's--

965
00:48:25.572 --> 00:48:28.075
She's taken my order before and it's--

966
00:48:28.242 --> 00:48:31.620
I'm thinking she'll remember it,
and it gets a little bit complicated...

967
00:48:31.787 --> 00:48:34.122
...so I'm thinking it could speed up
the process.

968
00:48:34.289 --> 00:48:36.083
You know, if it's not a big deal.

969
00:48:36.250 --> 00:48:38.585
Little help. Leigh?

970
00:48:38.752 --> 00:48:41.463
Your unique barista skills
have been requested.

971
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:43.131
Oh, hey.

972
00:48:43.298 --> 00:48:45.759
-Hi.
-What can I get you?

973
00:48:45.968 --> 00:48:47.302
Iced coffee, two Splendas.

974
00:48:48.387 --> 00:48:50.514
-That'll be $2.
-Nice tunes, by the way.

975
00:48:50.681 --> 00:48:53.350
You guys choose them yourself
or they come from Corporate?

976
00:48:53.517 --> 00:48:55.519
It's me. It's Snow Patrol.

977
00:48:55.686 --> 00:48:59.439
Oh, yeah. Good soundtrack.
Pretty good movie.

978
00:48:59.606 --> 00:49:03.944
Tell you one thing, Cuba Gooding definitely
does not belong in the snow, does he?

979
00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:08.532
You're thinking of Snow Dogs,
the kiddie flick.

980
00:49:08.699 --> 00:49:11.285
This is Snow Patrol, the band.

981
00:49:15.414 --> 00:49:16.957
Thank you for the tip.

982
00:49:17.166 --> 00:49:19.209
Ahem. I was making a joke.

983
00:49:19.376 --> 00:49:21.044
-No, you weren't.
-Yeah, I was.

984
00:49:21.211 --> 00:49:23.338
-You were dead serious.
-It was a joke.

985
00:49:29.553 --> 00:49:30.929
One sec.

986
00:49:31.847 --> 00:49:33.265
Hello?

987
00:49:34.224 --> 00:49:35.559
Here you go.

988
00:49:36.018 --> 00:49:40.314
Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced coffee,
mister. Hmm?

989
00:49:41.648 --> 00:49:42.733
Why are you smiling?

990
00:49:43.192 --> 00:49:47.529
You think this is some alligator-infested
moat? No one can get over there to you?

991
00:49:47.696 --> 00:49:50.949
You know, this whole kind of
I'm-on-the-inside, too-cool-for-school...

992
00:49:51.116 --> 00:49:53.118
...let's-make-fun-of
the-dorky-suburban-guy...

993
00:49:53.285 --> 00:49:56.330
...because-I'm-safe-on-this-side-of-the
counter routine's gonna get you hurt.

994
00:49:56.538 --> 00:49:59.333
Another thing?
After you've lost your parents' money...

995
00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:02.878
...on your avant-garde piece-of-crap
short film, you're gonna need a job.

996
00:50:03.045 --> 00:50:04.922
Guess what. It's guys like me that hire.

997
00:50:05.088 --> 00:50:07.841
Guys like me don't hire punks like you.
All right?

998
00:50:08.050 --> 00:50:11.136
So shape up. Good day, sir.

999
00:50:24.358 --> 00:50:26.401
I work out there.

1000
00:50:27.402 --> 00:50:30.239
Oh, really? Here?

1001
00:50:30.405 --> 00:50:34.034
Yeah, I work out at home but thinking
about taking my workouts public.

1002
00:50:34.201 --> 00:50:35.202
What do you squat?

1003
00:50:36.078 --> 00:50:41.416
Uh, well, I don't really squat. I just run on
the hamster wheel after work every day.

1004
00:50:41.583 --> 00:50:45.587
Ha, ha. The old hamster wheel.
Yeah. I'm on that baby too.

1005
00:50:49.633 --> 00:50:52.136
So did you, um, go to Harvard?

1006
00:50:52.303 --> 00:50:55.765
Yeah. I went to a party there once.

1007
00:50:58.186 --> 00:51:00.188
This is actually Harvard Health Care.

1008
00:51:00.354 --> 00:51:04.026
Yeah, I had to go in when I got a bunch
of tests done for my life insurance.

1009
00:51:04.193 --> 00:51:08.697
For your variable-term life insurance.
When you re-up on your death benefit, it--

1010
00:51:08.864 --> 00:51:11.159
Not a big deal. This is-- Ah.

1011
00:51:11.326 --> 00:51:14.705
This thing looks pretty good, though.
I like this. "Change your life."

1012
00:51:14.872 --> 00:51:15.956
it's a great place.

1013
00:51:16.123 --> 00:51:19.961
They've actually got a bar there,
so I always grab a beer after my workout.

1014
00:51:20.128 --> 00:51:22.714
- A bar? Ha, ha.
- it's a good routine.

1015
00:51:22.881 --> 00:51:24.549
Ha, ha. That sounds good.

1016
00:51:24.716 --> 00:51:28.262
If you decide to join, tell them Leigh
sent you and I'll get two free months.

1017
00:51:28.429 --> 00:51:30.681
Yeah. Sure thing, Leigh.

1018
00:51:30.848 --> 00:51:32.059
Rocking.

1019
00:51:32.226 --> 00:51:34.228
R-O-C-K in the U.S.A.

1020
00:51:35.562 --> 00:51:39.984
Or whatever they say in Australia.

1021
00:51:56.504 --> 00:51:58.632
Oh, I'm sorry. Ch.

1022
00:51:58.757 --> 00:52:00.968
Hi. Hello. Hi, Britney.

1023
00:52:01.134 --> 00:52:02.177
- Fred.
- Hello.

1024
00:52:02.344 --> 00:52:04.848
Hey. And hello to Alli--

1025
00:52:05.014 --> 00:52:06.182
- Come here.
- Anyway.

1026
00:52:06.307 --> 00:52:09.603
Mr. Searing? You pick up other day.
No more clothes here.

1027
00:52:09.770 --> 00:52:13.440
FRED: I know. I was just Corning by to let
you guys know what a great job you did.

1028
00:52:13.607 --> 00:52:15.777
As always.
Just the perfect amount of starch.

1029
00:52:16.278 --> 00:52:18.113
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1030
00:52:18.697 --> 00:52:20.616
Ah. I'm gonna head out.

1031
00:52:20.783 --> 00:52:23.703
Got a meeting across town in 'IO minutes,
so I should boogie.

1032
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:25.621
- Okay. Mm.
- Very nice seeing you.

1033
00:52:25.788 --> 00:52:29.293
Hey, if you get a chance,
please pound Ed's potato for me.

1034
00:52:29.459 --> 00:52:32.088
Okay. Uh, goodbye. Mwah.

1035
00:52:32.255 --> 00:52:34.299
Oh, don't do that. That's--

1036
00:52:34.465 --> 00:52:36.801
Okay. All right. Bye.

1037
00:52:53.572 --> 00:52:54.907
Hi.

1038
00:52:55.073 --> 00:52:56.158
You want a massage?

1039
00:52:56.325 --> 00:52:59.496
- Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You fill out form.

1040
00:53:05.503 --> 00:53:08.672
No, no, no. You know,
I'd prefer no paper trail.

1041
00:53:10.759 --> 00:53:12.928
Fill out form. It policy.

1042
00:53:13.094 --> 00:53:17.808
You know what? Um, honestly,
I'd prefer not to have anything in print.

1043
00:53:17.934 --> 00:53:19.852
- Little man. Scram.
- 1: Ha, ha.

1044
00:53:20.019 --> 00:53:22.314
How I know what you want
if you no fill out form?

1045
00:53:22.481 --> 00:53:25.025
I'll just say it to you. I'll just tell you.

1046
00:53:27.111 --> 00:53:29.697
- So, what you waiting for'?!
- Oh. Hey. Heh, heh.

1047
00:53:29.864 --> 00:53:32.576
Not very relaxing so far. Um....

1048
00:53:32.743 --> 00:53:34.745
Okay, um, come here.

1049
00:53:35.204 --> 00:53:39.376
Can I get a rub-and-tug
and finish off with a tea bag, please?

1050
00:53:41.628 --> 00:53:44.215
Okay. But must check with manager first.

1051
00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:45.591
No.

1052
00:53:47.218 --> 00:53:48.386
...rub-and-tug... tea bag...

1053
00:53:50.389 --> 00:53:52.975
- Um, she misheard. No.
- You must fill out form.

1054
00:53:53.141 --> 00:53:55.395
I said, rub, no tug.

1055
00:53:55.562 --> 00:53:57.564
And the tea bags were--
You heat those up.

1056
00:53:57.772 --> 00:54:00.776
You dip them in water, heat them up,
and put them on pressure--

1057
00:54:00.901 --> 00:54:03.445
How do I know more about massage
than you guys know about massage?

1058
00:54:03.612 --> 00:54:05.615
- That doesn't make sense.
- You are so busted.

1059
00:54:06.992 --> 00:54:08.034
Sorry. Oh, God.

1060
00:54:08.201 --> 00:54:09.870
Okay. Sorry.

1061
00:54:12.748 --> 00:54:15.251
- Shake it, shake it, shake it
- Like a tambourine

1062
00:54:15.418 --> 00:54:17.588
Shake it, shake it, shake it
You the one for me

1063
00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:19.590
Shake it, shake it, Mama
You the one for me

1064
00:54:19.756 --> 00:54:22.093
I'm realizing you're the only one
That's meant to be

1065
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.179
And when I wake up in the morning
All I wanna see

1066
00:54:24.345 --> 00:54:26.514
ls the sun and it's shining on you
Next to me

1067
00:54:26.681 --> 00:54:28.934
You got a little broken nail
Got a hair out of place

1068
00:54:29.101 --> 00:54:31.687
Got a little bit of extra middle
Right around the waist

1069
00:54:31.854 --> 00:54:34.107
- Shake it, shake it, shake it
- Like a tambourine

1070
00:54:34.274 --> 00:54:36.526
Shake it, shake it, shake it
You the one for me

1071
00:54:53.588 --> 00:54:55.090
Leigh?

1072
00:54:56.634 --> 00:54:58.385
Hey, girl.

1073
00:54:59.553 --> 00:55:00.639
An right!

1074
00:55:01.681 --> 00:55:03.767
Hey, Clyde. This is my friend....

1075
00:55:03.934 --> 00:55:05.185
- Rick.
- Rick.

1076
00:55:05.352 --> 00:55:06.479
He'd like to join.

1077
00:55:06.646 --> 00:55:07.772
Great.

1078
00:55:07.939 --> 00:55:10.441
- I'll get you signed right up.
- Okay.

1079
00:55:10.608 --> 00:55:12.486
- All right. I'll see you later on.
- Yeah.

1080
00:55:12.653 --> 00:55:16.323
Oh, Leigh, are you gonna grab a brew-ski
after your workout?

1081
00:55:16.490 --> 00:55:17.700
No.

1082
00:55:17.867 --> 00:55:19.077
Gonna grab two.

1083
00:55:20.161 --> 00:55:22.915
Meet me down here
in about one hour sharp.

1084
00:55:24.124 --> 00:55:25.918
Yeah. Peace it.

1085
00:55:36.347 --> 00:55:37.723
Ah.

1086
00:55:56.830 --> 00:55:58.164
Help!

1087
00:56:00.250 --> 00:56:02.211
I can't feel my legs!

1088
00:56:02.461 --> 00:56:04.755
I can't feel my muscles!

1089
00:56:07.467 --> 00:56:08.594
Holy shit!

1090
00:56:14.601 --> 00:56:16.269
- Did you faint, sir?
- No, I just....

1091
00:56:16.477 --> 00:56:18.898
I think I was in the hot tub too long.
I just....

1092
00:56:19.064 --> 00:56:20.816
My body just feels like jelly.

1093
00:56:20.983 --> 00:56:23.320
You're gonna be okay.
Just take a couple breaths.

1094
00:56:23.486 --> 00:56:25.071
Get me some towels.

1095
00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:28.784
No, no. Do me a favor.
Irish, switch places with this guy.

1096
00:56:28.993 --> 00:56:30.453
Why?

1097
00:56:38.378 --> 00:56:41.049
- Does this mean you're going steady?
- It's not funny.

1098
00:56:41.257 --> 00:56:44.677
This poor kid is spending his
hard-earned money on me. It's sad.

1099
00:56:45.262 --> 00:56:47.890
I mean, it's cute, but it's really sad.

1100
00:56:48.057 --> 00:56:51.978
You should be flattered. You're 38 years old
and you have college guys chasing you.

1101
00:56:52.145 --> 00:56:53.396
He thinks I'm 32.

1102
00:56:54.773 --> 00:56:58.736
What? Look, I just-- I feel bad if I
gave him the wrong impression, you know?

1103
00:56:58.945 --> 00:57:01.406
No, you didn't give him
the wrong impression.

1104
00:57:01.573 --> 00:57:03.992
"Dear Grace, our final game is tonight.

1105
00:57:04.159 --> 00:57:07.622
Please meet me at my place afterwards
to toast the best summer of my life.

1106
00:57:07.789 --> 00:57:10.917
Yours most truly, Gerald Ahern. "

1107
00:57:11.709 --> 00:57:13.212
Number 11.

1108
00:57:13.379 --> 00:57:15.381
Yeah, thanks for piling on.

1109
00:57:16.757 --> 00:57:18.218
I mean, I can't accept this.

1110
00:57:18.385 --> 00:57:20.554
I'm just gonna have to go
set him straight.

1111
00:57:26.936 --> 00:57:28.771
You know what I miss the most?

1112
00:57:29.106 --> 00:57:30.107
What?

1113
00:57:30.357 --> 00:57:31.400
The arch.

1114
00:57:31.858 --> 00:57:34.069
- The arch?
- Yeah.

1115
00:57:34.612 --> 00:57:38.616
You know that moment when you're taking
a girl's panties off for the very first time...

1116
00:57:38.825 --> 00:57:40.911
...and you don't know
if she's gonna stop you.

1117
00:57:41.078 --> 00:57:43.956
Then she gives
that tiny little pelvic arch thrust...

1118
00:57:44.123 --> 00:57:46.918
...to help you out,
let you know you're in the clear.

1119
00:57:47.085 --> 00:57:48.128
Smooth sailing.

1120
00:57:48.336 --> 00:57:49.880
I miss that.

1121
00:57:50.046 --> 00:57:51.924
- That's a nice moment.
- Yeah.

1122
00:57:53.676 --> 00:57:55.678
We let down the male species,
you know that?

1123
00:57:55.845 --> 00:57:58.348
Maybe you were right.
We should just call it quits...

1124
00:57:58.515 --> 00:58:01.351
- ... and just ask the girls to come home.
- No!

1125
00:58:01.518 --> 00:58:04.439
I want the hall pass, okay?

1126
00:58:04.606 --> 00:58:07.484
At first I wasn't sure,
but now I want the dream.

1127
00:58:07.651 --> 00:58:10.112
I don't even know
what the dream is anymore.

1128
00:58:10.279 --> 00:58:11.488
I'll tell you what it is.

1129
00:58:11.864 --> 00:58:14.826
I wanna remember what it feels like
to be with someone...

1130
00:58:14.993 --> 00:58:16.828
...who really wants to be with me...

1131
00:58:17.037 --> 00:58:18.706
...out of just pure desire...

1132
00:58:18.873 --> 00:58:22.668
...not because they have to
out of some sense of duty.

1133
00:58:24.504 --> 00:58:26.965
You know, all this arch talk's got me
craving some Mickey D's.

1134
00:58:27.132 --> 00:58:28.508
- Up for it?
- Yeah.

1135
00:58:34.182 --> 00:58:35.309
Hello?

1136
00:58:36.602 --> 00:58:39.480
Yeah. Yeah.

1137
00:58:39.855 --> 00:58:40.857
Okay.

1138
00:58:41.066 --> 00:58:43.735
All right. See you there.

1139
00:58:44.694 --> 00:58:45.737
Who was that?

1140
00:58:45.904 --> 00:58:48.324
Ah. That was just an angel from heaven.

1141
00:58:48.491 --> 00:58:49.992
Coakley's back in town.

1142
00:58:50.201 --> 00:58:51.495
- What?
- Yeah.

1143
00:58:51.662 --> 00:58:53.372
He wants to hang and he wants to bang.

1144
00:58:57.168 --> 00:58:58.878
Waiting for a sign

1145
00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:03.008
If I survive, I'll worship the moon

1146
00:59:04.885 --> 00:59:08.014
Or something, anything

1147
00:59:08.223 --> 00:59:12.185
Push the defrost button
on the microwave, boys.

1148
00:59:12.477 --> 00:59:14.981
The deep freeze is over.

1149
00:59:18.442 --> 00:59:20.237
And they talked

1150
00:59:20.404 --> 00:59:22.364
And they danced

1151
00:59:25.994 --> 00:59:27.829
Coakley.

1152
00:59:30.583 --> 00:59:31.667
Mm.

1153
00:59:33.419 --> 00:59:36.298
Okay, boys, you're on the clock now.

1154
00:59:36.464 --> 00:59:37.549
What?

1155
00:59:37.716 --> 00:59:40.969
You gotta hit them right out of the gate.
Half an hour from now you'll be old news.

1156
00:59:41.137 --> 00:59:44.056
Oh. Should we go talk
with this girl right here?

1157
00:59:44.223 --> 00:59:46.017
Don't waste your time, man.

1158
00:59:46.183 --> 00:59:47.227
Why?

1159
00:59:47.436 --> 00:59:49.688
Workaholic.
She'll be out of here in five minutes.

1160
00:59:49.855 --> 00:59:52.275
- What are you talking about?
- Look at her hand.

1161
00:59:52.442 --> 00:59:54.277
Carpal tunnel syndrome.

1162
00:59:54.485 --> 00:59:56.613
Even if she stayed,
you wouldn't want her.

1163
00:59:56.779 --> 01:00:01.452
You get a hand job from her, you need
the Jaws of Life to get you out of it.

1164
01:00:01.619 --> 01:00:03.371
Yeah, there she goes.

1165
01:00:03.538 --> 01:00:06.291
Wow. You're good.

1166
01:00:06.499 --> 01:00:07.959
Oh, hey. Hey.

1167
01:00:08.126 --> 01:00:10.713
- The tall blond, right here. Yeah.
- Hmm.

1168
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:14.468
Forget about it. It's an illusion.
She's surrounded by stootfish.

1169
01:00:14.676 --> 01:00:15.969
Stootfish?

1170
01:00:16.178 --> 01:00:19.682
When an eight surrounds herself
with less attractive women...

1171
01:00:19.849 --> 01:00:23.311
- ... to make her look like a 10.
- What are you talking about? She is a 10.

1172
01:00:23.519 --> 01:00:25.648
You make me laugh, Freddie.
Come on, try this.

1173
01:00:25.814 --> 01:00:27.149
All right.

1174
01:00:27.316 --> 01:00:29.485
- What is it?
- Now block everything out.

1175
01:00:29.652 --> 01:00:31.029
- Tell me what you see.
- Wha--?

1176
01:00:31.196 --> 01:00:34.324
Uh-huh. Okay, now watch this, man.

1177
01:00:34.532 --> 01:00:35.659
Hot.

1178
01:00:35.825 --> 01:00:36.994
Right.

1179
01:00:37.328 --> 01:00:39.497
- Not.
- Oh, my God.

1180
01:00:39.664 --> 01:00:41.249
Hot.

1181
01:00:43.252 --> 01:00:44.503
Not.

1182
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:46.797
- Holy shit!
- Ha-ha-ha.

1183
01:00:47.005 --> 01:00:49.717
That's amazing.
You're like A Beautiful Mind.

1184
01:00:51.261 --> 01:00:54.098
I can't do well
When I think you're gonna leave me

1185
01:00:54.265 --> 01:00:55.808
But I know I try

1186
01:00:56.892 --> 01:00:58.478
Are you gonna leave me now?

1187
01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.191
Can't you be believing now?

1188
01:01:05.361 --> 01:01:06.696
Hey, Mr. Mills.

1189
01:01:06.862 --> 01:01:08.698
Hey! Paige!

1190
01:01:08.864 --> 01:01:10.701
I thought you were down at the Cape.

1191
01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:14.162
Your in-laws took the kids for the weekend,
so I came home early.

1192
01:01:14.622 --> 01:01:16.958
- Okay.
- I turned 21 today.

1193
01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:18.418
I'm legal now.

1194
01:01:18.585 --> 01:01:20.170
- Oh, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

1195
01:01:20.379 --> 01:01:21.714
Yeah. You out celebrating?

1196
01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.216
Yeah, my cousin got me
and my aunt on the VIP list.

1197
01:01:24.842 --> 01:01:26.261
That's my Aunt Meg over there.

1198
01:01:26.678 --> 01:01:28.972
She's 45 years old and she still parties
like she's my age.

1199
01:01:29.139 --> 01:01:31.392
- Whoo!
- Wow.

1200
01:01:31.809 --> 01:01:34.061
So, Rick, how's the week off
from marriage going?

1201
01:01:34.270 --> 01:01:37.232
You don't mind if I call you Rick?
I am officially an adult now.

1202
01:01:37.399 --> 01:01:39.109
No, sure. But what did you just say?

1203
01:01:39.276 --> 01:01:43.072
I was asking you about that hall-pass thing.
I babysat for the Putneys last night.

1204
01:01:43.239 --> 01:01:44.907
I heard Mr. Putney talking about it.

1205
01:01:45.074 --> 01:01:47.745
Gary was talk--
who was he talking about it to?

1206
01:01:47.912 --> 01:01:50.039
- Just everyone at the barbecue.
- What?

1207
01:01:50.205 --> 01:01:52.583
Oh, I don't think he meant it
in a bad way.

1208
01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:56.087
I actually think it's cool of you to be
staying at the Comfy Nite Inn...

1209
01:01:56.254 --> 01:02:00.551
...instead of bringing girls back to your
home with the kids' pictures all taped up.

1210
01:02:00.718 --> 01:02:01.928
Thank you.

1211
01:02:02.094 --> 01:02:05.474
- What can I get you?
- Can I get three tequila shots, please?

1212
01:02:06.099 --> 01:02:09.729
By the way, I think that I owe you
an apology.

1213
01:02:09.896 --> 01:02:13.691
Last week when you drove me home,
I shouldn't have snapped at you like that.

1214
01:02:13.858 --> 01:02:18.405
No, no, no. Don't be ridiculous.
It was just a misunderstanding.

1215
01:02:18.614 --> 01:02:19.823
No, it wasn't.

1216
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:22.619
If you thought that I was
kind of coming on to you...

1217
01:02:22.827 --> 01:02:26.415
...it's probably because I kind of was.

1218
01:02:30.544 --> 01:02:35.342
- Fifty-seven bucks.
- What? Are you kidding me? That--

1219
01:02:35.801 --> 01:02:37.220
That seems a little stiff.

1220
01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:40.515
They're just kids in here. I don't see
how they afford these prices.

1221
01:02:40.974 --> 01:02:43.936
- Paige, I better get going.
- What? where are you going?

1222
01:02:44.103 --> 01:02:48.233
Paige, you're my kids' babysitter.
Have a happy birthday.

1223
01:02:49.234 --> 01:02:51.361
But my Aunt Meg wants to meet you.

1224
01:02:54.615 --> 01:02:57.243
- All right.
- Yeah! Getting wasted.

1225
01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.913
- Whoo! Mm.
- The spirits doth floweth.

1226
01:03:02.291 --> 01:03:03.750
- Aah!
- Yeah! Ha, ha.

1227
01:03:06.462 --> 01:03:08.923
That girl over there is looking at you.

1228
01:03:09.841 --> 01:03:13.637
Which one? What? The one that looks
like Chief from Cuckoo's Nest?

1229
01:03:13.804 --> 01:03:16.391
No, no, man. The one sitting next to her.

1230
01:03:18.727 --> 01:03:19.728
Oh, yeah.

1231
01:03:19.894 --> 01:03:22.982
She's very vulnerable.
She just quit cigarettes.

1232
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:24.525
How do you know?

1233
01:03:24.775 --> 01:03:28.322
Because she can't take her eyes
off the smokers over there.

1234
01:03:30.532 --> 01:03:32.368
How do you know
those aren't her friends?

1235
01:03:32.577 --> 01:03:36.039
- Come on, Coakley, give me a break.
- Well, that might be plausible...

1236
01:03:36.205 --> 01:03:38.000
...if her lips weren't shaking...

1237
01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:40.669
...and her fingernails weren't chewed
down to the nub.

1238
01:03:40.836 --> 01:03:44.883
And that bag, man. That's a little big
to be bringing into a club.

1239
01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:48.929
Unless she needs room
for a $5 foot-long.

1240
01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:51.474
- So you got a woman who quit smoking.
- Right.

1241
01:03:51.641 --> 01:03:54.645
She's tense, she's hungry.

1242
01:03:55.062 --> 01:03:57.564
And it all adds up to What?

1243
01:03:58.565 --> 01:04:00.068
That woman needs something in her mouth.

1244
01:04:00.234 --> 01:04:02.070
Aah, that's my boy! Let's go!

1245
01:04:02.236 --> 01:04:04.072
- Now?
- Right now, man. The universe is calling.

1246
01:04:04.238 --> 01:04:05.991
- I don't know if we need to go now.
- Come on.

1247
01:04:08.243 --> 01:04:09.662
Walking on a dream

1248
01:04:10.956 --> 01:04:13.208
How can I explain?

1249
01:04:14.834 --> 01:04:16.462
Talking to myself

1250
01:04:18.714 --> 01:04:20.591
Will I see again?

1251
01:04:22.511 --> 01:04:26.098
We are always running for the thrill of it
Thrill of it

1252
01:04:26.264 --> 01:04:29.852
Always pushing up the hill
Searching for the thrill of it

1253
01:04:30.019 --> 01:04:32.438
On and on and on
We are calling out

1254
01:04:32.605 --> 01:04:35.025
How late's this bitch
staying open tonight?

1255
01:04:35.192 --> 01:04:36.235
Ick.

1256
01:04:38.822 --> 01:04:41.783
Is it real now

1257
01:04:42.450 --> 01:04:45.913
When two people become one?

1258
01:04:46.122 --> 01:04:49.292
I can feel it

1259
01:04:50.127 --> 01:04:53.672
When two people become one

1260
01:04:53.839 --> 01:04:56.926
Is it real now

1261
01:04:57.677 --> 01:05:00.639
When two people become one?

1262
01:05:01.432 --> 01:05:04.018
I can feel it

1263
01:05:04.184 --> 01:05:05.227
Hey, girl.

1264
01:05:05.394 --> 01:05:06.813
Hey.

1265
01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.481
What are you doing here?

1266
01:05:08.648 --> 01:05:09.774
Just chilling.

1267
01:05:09.941 --> 01:05:11.652
Yeah, me too.

1268
01:05:11.861 --> 01:05:13.779
Just chilling and wiggling.

1269
01:05:14.155 --> 01:05:17.159
What happened to you yesterday?
Thought we were gonna get a beer.

1270
01:05:17.326 --> 01:05:18.452
Yeah. Uh....

1271
01:05:18.619 --> 01:05:23.666
I got caught up in my reps and my curls
and shit and just lost track of time.

1272
01:05:23.875 --> 01:05:27.170
So is this, like, your playground?
It seems like great energy in here.

1273
01:05:27.337 --> 01:05:29.465
No, I've actually never been here before.

1274
01:05:29.673 --> 01:05:32.343
A friend of mine's DJ'ing,
so I promised him I'd come.

1275
01:05:32.509 --> 01:05:34.346
Calling out and out again

1276
01:05:34.512 --> 01:05:35.805
Never looking down

1277
01:05:35.972 --> 01:05:38.224
So is this guy like your boyfriend
or something?

1278
01:05:38.391 --> 01:05:40.019
No, no, no.

1279
01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:42.313
Well, we messed around once,
but just a little.

1280
01:05:42.521 --> 01:05:44.566
And by a little you mean--?

1281
01:05:44.733 --> 01:05:46.026
Anal.

1282
01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:47.903
Okay. Yeah.

1283
01:05:49.071 --> 01:05:50.365
I'm joking.

1284
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:52.075
- Oh. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

1285
01:05:52.575 --> 01:05:56.372
He kissed me one night. Kissed him back.
It was a big mistake.

1286
01:05:58.624 --> 01:06:00.542
So, what's with the ring?

1287
01:06:00.709 --> 01:06:01.878
Yeah, I--

1288
01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:05.423
You ever heard of a hall pass?

1289
01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:09.679
All right, it's about time I take
the governor off this beyotch!

1290
01:06:10.304 --> 01:06:13.350
It was those tall skinny guys
and they were all over my yard.

1291
01:06:13.558 --> 01:06:16.561
But here's the weird thing.
I wasn't even afraid of them at all.

1292
01:06:16.728 --> 01:06:19.816
And when they asked me if I wanted to go
with them, I said, "Sure."

1293
01:06:19.983 --> 01:06:21.651
And I walked right in.

1294
01:06:21.818 --> 01:06:24.154
Oh, my God. You are so brave.

1295
01:06:24.321 --> 01:06:26.532
I would never climb
into one of those things.

1296
01:06:26.699 --> 01:06:29.995
Fred, would you ever just walk
into a UFO on your own?

1297
01:06:30.161 --> 01:06:32.914
I would if one came right now, sure.

1298
01:06:35.751 --> 01:06:37.253
Wow, so you're married?

1299
01:06:37.795 --> 01:06:41.717
Yeah. It wasn't like I was trying
to hide it. I mean, you know.

1300
01:06:41.883 --> 01:06:46.431
No, I just thought your wife might've died
and you're wearing it out of respect.

1301
01:06:46.597 --> 01:06:50.226
Oh, no.
No, she's still hanging in there.

1302
01:06:50.853 --> 01:06:52.855
Hey, you okay?
You keep checking your pulse.

1303
01:06:53.022 --> 01:06:57.444
Yeah. I just-- I got a little
chest cramp, but I'm working through it.

1304
01:06:57.610 --> 01:06:58.653
Ouch.

1305
01:06:58.820 --> 01:06:59.904
- Yeah.
- Heartburn?

1306
01:07:00.071 --> 01:07:05.286
No, it feels more like excessive
plaque build-up in the arteries.

1307
01:07:12.044 --> 01:07:13.880
Hi, Maggie. This is Isabel.

1308
01:07:14.047 --> 01:07:16.591
I went to clean the house today,
but nobody has been there...

1309
01:07:16.758 --> 01:07:18.761
...or slept in any of the beds this week...

1310
01:07:18.927 --> 01:07:21.138
...so I just cleaned the windows
and left early.

1311
01:07:21.305 --> 01:07:22.765
I hope you don't mind. Bye.

1312
01:07:31.317 --> 01:07:32.652
Hey.

1313
01:07:34.780 --> 01:07:35.989
What are you doing here?

1314
01:07:36.156 --> 01:07:39.076
I thought you might wanna help me
celebrate the end of the season.

1315
01:07:39.242 --> 01:07:40.495
Oh, um....

1316
01:07:41.162 --> 01:07:43.623
Uh, brought some good late-night eats.

1317
01:07:45.793 --> 01:07:49.129
Yeah. Yeah, come on in.

1318
01:07:52.509 --> 01:07:54.844
What are you doing, man? Come on.

1319
01:07:55.011 --> 01:07:59.100
You found your dream girl, now take her
back to the hotel and take care of business.

1320
01:07:59.266 --> 01:08:02.187
We don't have much in common.
I can't even talk to her.

1321
01:08:02.354 --> 01:08:05.357
Talk to her? Fred, now what do you want,
a pen pal or a poon pal?

1322
01:08:05.524 --> 01:08:07.652
I only got one shot at this, all right?

1323
01:08:07.819 --> 01:08:09.278
I think I can do better.

1324
01:08:09.445 --> 01:08:12.448
Every loser in Vegas
thinks they can do better.

1325
01:08:12.615 --> 01:08:16.370
You know what winners do? They walk
away from the table while they're up.

1326
01:08:18.247 --> 01:08:20.333
Licky like a sexy ear

1327
01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.210
Lick here

1328
01:08:24.755 --> 01:08:28.259
L-I licky C-K licky Y

1329
01:08:28.426 --> 01:08:31.513
Why? Because I am a licky-licky guy

1330
01:08:31.722 --> 01:08:32.723
Yeah!

1331
01:08:32.889 --> 01:08:35.435
L licky I-C licky K-Y

1332
01:08:35.601 --> 01:08:37.437
I'm just a licky girl

1333
01:08:37.603 --> 01:08:39.522
How do I know
if she'll come home with me?

1334
01:08:39.689 --> 01:08:43.652
Oh, she'll come home with you.
She's wearing a thong, man.

1335
01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:45.738
How do you know that?

1336
01:08:45.904 --> 01:08:47.449
I did a crawl-by.

1337
01:08:48.700 --> 01:08:50.410
Coakley.

1338
01:08:52.246 --> 01:08:54.457
Licky my sticky

1339
01:08:55.207 --> 01:08:56.792
Fuck it. Okay, here.

1340
01:08:57.753 --> 01:09:02.132
Give those to Rick.
I'm gonna take a cab back to the hotel. Oh.

1341
01:09:02.299 --> 01:09:03.384
- Freddie.
- What?

1342
01:09:05.094 --> 01:09:07.764
It has been an honor
to watch you grow up.

1343
01:09:11.518 --> 01:09:12.811
All right.

1344
01:09:12.978 --> 01:09:15.398
Licky like a Steadicam

1345
01:09:16.232 --> 01:09:17.233
Licky like a tangerine

1346
01:09:17.442 --> 01:09:21.280
We're taking the party back to my house.
Bring a girl or don't come, man.

1347
01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.090
Hey. There's my girl.

1348
01:09:36.882 --> 01:09:39.468
Come on in.
I'm just mixing up some margaronis.

1349
01:09:39.635 --> 01:09:41.971
We lost our final game today,
but I went yard.

1350
01:09:42.138 --> 01:09:43.473
Oh, that's good.

1351
01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:45.767
So, um, where is everybody?

1352
01:09:45.934 --> 01:09:48.771
They all went out to some party.
Come on in.

1353
01:09:48.938 --> 01:09:50.940
Gerry, I can't stay.

1354
01:09:51.899 --> 01:09:53.068
What?

1355
01:09:54.236 --> 01:09:55.320
Is everything okay?

1356
01:09:55.487 --> 01:09:57.489
Yeah. No, everything's fine.

1357
01:09:57.656 --> 01:10:02.078
Look, um, I really can't accept this.

1358
01:10:02.495 --> 01:10:03.580
Why not?

1359
01:10:03.747 --> 01:10:07.751
Because I'm a married woman, Gerry,
you know that.

1360
01:10:09.129 --> 01:10:10.630
Oh. Um....

1361
01:10:12.132 --> 01:10:17.346
Look, I'm really sorry if I made you
feel uncomfortable, Grace.

1362
01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:19.015
It's just...

1363
01:10:19.682 --> 01:10:20.851
...I really like you.

1364
01:10:22.352 --> 01:10:23.687
I like you too, Gerry.

1365
01:10:23.895 --> 01:10:26.941
And, no, you didn't make me feel
uncomfortable.

1366
01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:33.365
The mystery zone

1367
01:10:34.074 --> 01:10:35.534
All right

1368
01:10:37.912 --> 01:10:38.997
Wait, are you serious?

1369
01:10:39.164 --> 01:10:40.665
You might have appendicitis?

1370
01:10:40.874 --> 01:10:43.711
My stomach's rumbling
and I'm having these shooting pains.

1371
01:10:43.919 --> 01:10:45.504
I should take you to the hospital.

1372
01:10:45.713 --> 01:10:49.051
No, I'll be all right.
It's probably just this stupid patch.

1373
01:10:49.217 --> 01:10:51.094
I mean, I quit smoking and--

1374
01:10:52.554 --> 01:10:55.933
It's just-- I think I'm allergic to it,
and it makes me all queasy and--

1375
01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:59.021
- Oh.
- Plus, I had a bunch of drinks at the club.

1376
01:10:59.188 --> 01:11:00.689
Well, are you gonna throw up?

1377
01:11:00.898 --> 01:11:03.067
Oh. No, I can't.

1378
01:11:03.233 --> 01:11:05.570
Ooh, here. Here. Here.
Just take this just in case.

1379
01:11:05.737 --> 01:11:07.864
No, I'm one of those people
who can never throw up.

1380
01:11:09.658 --> 01:11:12.411
I wish I could throw up.
I know it would help.

1381
01:11:19.878 --> 01:11:21.881
Oh. Wow.

1382
01:11:22.757 --> 01:11:26.220
You know What?
I think I feel a little better.

1383
01:11:28.055 --> 01:11:29.598
That sneeze helped.

1384
01:11:30.933 --> 01:11:33.269
Take her wherever she wants to go.
Here you are.

1385
01:11:34.688 --> 01:11:37.274
But I never got your number!

1386
01:11:57.339 --> 01:12:00.218
- Can I help you?
- You must be Rick.

1387
01:12:00.719 --> 01:12:01.761
Go on.

1388
01:12:01.928 --> 01:12:04.807
Hi, my name's Meg. Paige's aunt.

1389
01:12:16.154 --> 01:12:18.573
I guess I still have a lot
to get out of my system...

1390
01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.993
...before I do the whole marriage trip,
you know?

1391
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.288
I'm one of those people that wants
to try everything once.

1392
01:12:24.455 --> 01:12:25.622
And the good things twice.

1393
01:12:27.250 --> 01:12:28.793
Oh, like swim with the dolphins.

1394
01:12:29.002 --> 01:12:32.339
- Yeah. I'd love to meet the Dalai Lama.
- Mm. Sure.

1395
01:12:32.548 --> 01:12:34.759
- Bungee jump.
- Oh, I've already done that.

1396
01:12:34.925 --> 01:12:36.969
- Skydiving.
- Skinny-dip in the Indian Ocean.

1397
01:12:37.136 --> 01:12:39.222
- Sleep with a married guy. Ha, ha.
- Ha, ha.

1398
01:12:40.766 --> 01:12:43.936
I just mean if that was one
of the things on the old bucket list...

1399
01:12:44.103 --> 01:12:47.148
...I could help you cross that off.
To sleep with a married guy.

1400
01:12:47.356 --> 01:12:50.152
Ahem. What'd you say, the Indian Ocean?

1401
01:12:50.319 --> 01:12:52.696
- I don't wanna be a homewrecker, Rick.
- No, no, no.

1402
01:12:52.863 --> 01:12:55.075
That's what I'm saying. I've got a pass.

1403
01:12:55.241 --> 01:12:58.828
You could do this with a clear conscience.
I'm not trying to sell you on it.

1404
01:12:58.995 --> 01:13:01.123
Those are the facts of the situation.

1405
01:13:03.042 --> 01:13:07.881
It's getting a little loud in here. Is there
somewhere a bit more quiet we could go?

1406
01:13:08.048 --> 01:13:10.384
Coakley's game room upstairs.
It's soundless.

1407
01:13:10.551 --> 01:13:13.221
- It's like space.
- Leigh!

1408
01:13:14.013 --> 01:13:16.100
- Leigh.
- Oh, this fucking guy.

1409
01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:17.768
Brent, what are you doing here?

1410
01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:20.437
The old dude invited me.
He invited the entire club.

1411
01:13:20.604 --> 01:13:22.857
You knew how important tonight was!

1412
01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:25.735
My whole family was there!
And they don't come to anything!

1413
01:13:25.902 --> 01:13:27.154
The fuck you looking at?

1414
01:13:27.321 --> 01:13:30.449
Everyone came tonight
and they stayed, except for you!

1415
01:13:30.616 --> 01:13:32.243
That's not respectful!

1416
01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:33.662
Okay, just calm down.

1417
01:13:33.829 --> 01:13:37.082
No! I would like to speak to you alone.
Alone.

1418
01:13:38.042 --> 01:13:40.086
I'll just be a second.

1419
01:13:50.473 --> 01:13:52.809
- Ahem. Uh, hey.
- Oh, hey.

1420
01:13:53.435 --> 01:14:00.402
Uh, sorry about being a little, you know,
quick on the trigger there. It's just, uh....

1421
01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:04.698
You know, you're so hot
I couldn't help myself.

1422
01:14:04.865 --> 01:14:05.992
Oh....

1423
01:14:06.617 --> 01:14:08.035
It's fine.

1424
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:11.498
Is, uh, everything okay?

1425
01:14:11.665 --> 01:14:14.209
Yeah. Yeah.

1426
01:14:19.507 --> 01:14:23.429
Uh.... No, everything's not okay.

1427
01:14:24.138 --> 01:14:25.556
Um....

1428
01:14:26.557 --> 01:14:29.311
Look, you're a great guy, Gerry.

1429
01:14:29.478 --> 01:14:32.189
But what just happened here....

1430
01:14:32.606 --> 01:14:35.818
Yeah, that can never happen again.

1431
01:14:35.985 --> 01:14:37.737
Okay?

1432
01:14:38.112 --> 01:14:39.114
Oh.

1433
01:14:39.323 --> 01:14:44.412
I mean, I know it's kind of hard
to understand after....

1434
01:14:45.246 --> 01:14:50.461
But, um, I really love my husband.

1435
01:14:51.504 --> 01:14:54.590
And in reality, you and me, here...

1436
01:14:54.757 --> 01:14:59.805
...this could never be more
than what it just was.

1437
01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:04.185
Yeah. I know that.

1438
01:15:04.352 --> 01:15:05.686
You do?

1439
01:15:05.853 --> 01:15:07.356
Well, yeah.

1440
01:15:07.523 --> 01:15:10.692
Yeah, no. I mean, jeez, um....

1441
01:15:10.859 --> 01:15:14.989
Look, no offense or anything,
but let's face it. You're a lot older than me.

1442
01:15:16.825 --> 01:15:19.286
- By--
- No, I don't mean that in a bad way.

1443
01:15:19.453 --> 01:15:24.668
It's just, you know, I didn't think we were
gonna start dating or anything, you know?

1444
01:15:26.044 --> 01:15:28.464
Jeez, can you imagine, like,
the looks that we would get?

1445
01:15:28.631 --> 01:15:31.509
It'd be like Hugh Hefner
and his girlfriends.

1446
01:15:31.676 --> 01:15:34.179
- Ha, ha. You'd be Hef.
- Yeah, I got that.

1447
01:15:34.638 --> 01:15:37.057
- Yeah.
- Hmm. Huh.

1448
01:15:37.725 --> 01:15:41.730
Um, you know What? I gotta get going.
We have a--

1449
01:15:41.896 --> 01:15:44.734
We have a team meeting in like 20 minutes.
It's a tradition.

1450
01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:47.319
It'd probably be really uncool
if I didn't--

1451
01:15:47.486 --> 01:15:48.988
Yeah, you don't have to explain.

1452
01:15:49.155 --> 01:15:50.240
Okay.

1453
01:15:50.407 --> 01:15:53.660
Um, well, seriously, though,
thanks for everything.

1454
01:15:53.869 --> 01:15:56.122
- You're awesome at sex.
- Oh.

1455
01:16:02.087 --> 01:16:05.424
I'm sure there's an explanation
for why he hasn't slept in your bed.

1456
01:16:05.591 --> 01:16:07.719
You know,
maybe he took a trip somewhere.

1457
01:16:07.886 --> 01:16:11.765
No. He can't. He has two houses closing
escrow this week. He has to be in town.

1458
01:16:11.931 --> 01:16:15.561
Maybe he has been home, but he can't
stand sleeping in your bed without you...

1459
01:16:15.728 --> 01:16:18.106
...so he's been racking on the couch and,
you know...

1460
01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:19.483
...banging all the women there.

1461
01:16:20.942 --> 01:16:22.527
Here, open. Oh.

1462
01:16:24.072 --> 01:16:25.239
You--

1463
01:16:25.698 --> 01:16:29.161
- Not bad, huh?
- All right. Yeah. Ha-ha-ha.

1464
01:16:35.001 --> 01:16:37.545
Um, I wonder what's keeping Grace.

1465
01:16:37.712 --> 01:16:39.757
She went over there
to break the kid's heart.

1466
01:16:39.965 --> 01:16:42.468
The least she could do
is lend a sympathetic ear.

1467
01:17:04.327 --> 01:17:06.287
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1468
01:17:08.082 --> 01:17:10.126
I hope you don't mind
me tracking you down.

1469
01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.002
Paige told me where you were staying.

1470
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:15.799
Please. No, not at all. No.
It's good to have company.

1471
01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:18.176
You've been very sweet to her.

1472
01:17:18.594 --> 01:17:22.890
Well, you know, she's a good kid. She's
a good kid and I do what I can for the kids.

1473
01:17:23.057 --> 01:17:28.021
She told me everything
and I have to admit, I was very impressed.

1474
01:17:28.188 --> 01:17:29.189
Hmm?

1475
01:17:29.357 --> 01:17:34.989
I mean, I know she came on to you twice,
and that both times you set her straight.

1476
01:17:35.156 --> 01:17:36.240
She came on to me?

1477
01:17:36.407 --> 01:17:38.159
Rick, enough with the chivalry.

1478
01:17:38.325 --> 01:17:43.415
I mean, come on. Paige has a crush on
you and you didn't take advantage of her.

1479
01:17:43.582 --> 01:17:47.670
I'm just saying, that is very cool.

1480
01:17:47.837 --> 01:17:53.218
Especially since you have
your wife's permission now.

1481
01:17:53.719 --> 01:17:55.179
Yeah.

1482
01:17:55.471 --> 01:17:56.555
I like that, Rick.

1483
01:17:58.808 --> 01:18:00.059
You have morals.

1484
01:18:01.853 --> 01:18:02.980
Yeah.

1485
01:18:03.147 --> 01:18:05.149
Well, all you have in this world
is your word.

1486
01:18:05.316 --> 01:18:06.358
Mm.

1487
01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:10.197
Quiet little voices

1488
01:18:10.363 --> 01:18:12.657
Creep into my head I'm young again

1489
01:18:12.824 --> 01:18:18.372
I'm young again, I'm young again
I'm young again

1490
01:18:18.539 --> 01:18:21.293
Quiet little monsters

1491
01:18:21.460 --> 01:18:23.670
Creep inside my bedroom wall

1492
01:18:23.837 --> 01:18:29.385
I'll fall for you, I'll fall for you
I'll fall for you

1493
01:18:29.594 --> 01:18:31.972
Quiet words of wisdom

1494
01:18:32.431 --> 01:18:34.809
Creep into your victim's ears

1495
01:18:34.975 --> 01:18:38.939
I'll die for you, I'll die for you
I'll die for you

1496
01:18:39.106 --> 01:18:41.442
- I love that picture.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1497
01:18:41.609 --> 01:18:43.903
- Yeah. That was a great day, man.
- It was.

1498
01:18:44.070 --> 01:18:46.072
Everybody had a great time
at that wedding.

1499
01:18:46.281 --> 01:18:48.242
I mean everybody.

1500
01:18:48.534 --> 01:18:50.994
You know, I went balls deep
in one of the bridesmaids.

1501
01:18:51.161 --> 01:18:52.372
Yeah, I remember.

1502
01:18:52.539 --> 01:18:57.962
She was a really pretty girl
with these big old floppy tits. Boom.

1503
01:18:58.129 --> 01:19:00.881
Hello? Bluh. Ha, ha.

1504
01:19:01.048 --> 01:19:02.758
You-- what was her name, man?

1505
01:19:02.926 --> 01:19:04.386
- Jenny. Yeah.
- Jenny.

1506
01:19:04.553 --> 01:19:06.596
My sister, Jenny.

1507
01:19:09.767 --> 01:19:12.061
Nice girl. Really sweet.

1508
01:19:12.812 --> 01:19:14.481
- And how's she doing?
- Good.

1509
01:19:14.648 --> 01:19:15.983
Oh, great, man, great.

1510
01:19:16.150 --> 01:19:19.320
- Still married.
- Oh, is she? Great. I'm glad it worked out.

1511
01:19:19.529 --> 01:19:22.282
Seemed like they were having problems,
you know?

1512
01:19:48.188 --> 01:19:49.647
- Hey.
- Hey.

1513
01:19:49.856 --> 01:19:50.857
There you are.

1514
01:19:51.024 --> 01:19:54.361
Uh, yeah.
I was thinking that you were gone.

1515
01:19:54.570 --> 01:19:57.281
No. I told you,
I just had to talk him off the ledge.

1516
01:19:57.448 --> 01:19:58.992
I sent him home. He's fine now.

1517
01:19:59.159 --> 01:20:01.495
- Ha, ha.
- You picked somewhere nice and quiet.

1518
01:20:01.661 --> 01:20:04.791
Yeah. Yeah, it is, uh, quiet in here.

1519
01:20:04.957 --> 01:20:09.588
You know, in fact, it's so quiet
I kind of just-- I kind of hit a wall.

1520
01:20:09.755 --> 01:20:12.049
Yeah, I was-- I'm gonna split.

1521
01:20:12.216 --> 01:20:14.385
Really? Are you--? You okay?

1522
01:20:14.594 --> 01:20:15.845
Yeah. No, I feel good.

1523
01:20:16.012 --> 01:20:20.559
I got a little tickle in my ear that I get
in the summer from mold spores that--

1524
01:20:20.726 --> 01:20:24.522
You gotta be careful because they'll come
into your throat. But no, no, I got....

1525
01:20:25.147 --> 01:20:26.525
I have commitments.

1526
01:20:26.691 --> 01:20:28.068
Wow.

1527
01:20:32.448 --> 01:20:34.408
Hey, relax.

1528
01:20:35.076 --> 01:20:37.204
Try not to think so much.

1529
01:20:38.413 --> 01:20:41.708
You have your wife
for the rest of your life.

1530
01:20:41.875 --> 01:20:43.878
Tonight, you can have me.

1531
01:20:45.964 --> 01:20:47.758
So I drink again

1532
01:20:48.592 --> 01:20:52.513
Oh, oh. And I play the game

1533
01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:55.475
Oh, oh. Like I did yesterday

1534
01:20:55.642 --> 01:20:58.604
Uh, you know What? I'm sorry.

1535
01:20:59.939 --> 01:21:03.359
I can't do this. I can't do this, I'm sorry.

1536
01:21:04.736 --> 01:21:07.197
Your wife didn't give you
a permission slip, did she?

1537
01:21:07.364 --> 01:21:08.407
No, no, she did.

1538
01:21:08.574 --> 01:21:11.744
Look, you are insanely beautiful
and sexy...

1539
01:21:11.911 --> 01:21:16.041
...and every cell in my body
is angry at me right now.

1540
01:21:16.208 --> 01:21:18.127
I've got, like, a mutiny on my hands.

1541
01:21:18.294 --> 01:21:20.505
I feel like I'm vibrating. Like....

1542
01:21:22.299 --> 01:21:23.758
But you see this area?

1543
01:21:24.634 --> 01:21:26.053
This spot right here.

1544
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:30.224
The first time I ever slept with Maggie back
in college, she fell asleep right here...

1545
01:21:30.391 --> 01:21:32.811
...and she left, like,
a little pool of drool...

1546
01:21:32.978 --> 01:21:35.981
...but it didn't really bother me.
It actually felt good.

1547
01:21:36.190 --> 01:21:39.402
And I thought, "I wanna marry this girl."

1548
01:21:39.569 --> 01:21:41.988
And then I did.
It was, like, a long shot.

1549
01:21:42.405 --> 01:21:44.909
And miraculously, it came through.

1550
01:21:45.075 --> 01:21:47.453
And then we had kids.
Emma, Gunnar and Mac.

1551
01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:52.167
And that's their spot. When they're
brand-new they'd sleep right here.

1552
01:21:52.334 --> 01:21:55.171
When it'd be 4 in the morning
you'd be holding their head...

1553
01:21:55.338 --> 01:21:58.674
...because their little necks don't have--
They're just kind of like--

1554
01:21:58.841 --> 01:22:01.845
And it's where we first
got to know each other.

1555
01:22:02.012 --> 01:22:06.476
And it doesn't matter
how beautiful you are....

1556
01:22:08.228 --> 01:22:10.147
I gotta go home.

1557
01:22:10.356 --> 01:22:12.900
I wanna go home.

1558
01:22:17.697 --> 01:22:21.661
Well, uh, you definitely have
a screw loose.

1559
01:22:22.745 --> 01:22:26.542
And you're probably going to regret this
for the rest of your life...

1560
01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:29.419
...but, uh, you know What?

1561
01:22:30.546 --> 01:22:32.090
You're a good guy.

1562
01:22:37.262 --> 01:22:39.223
Um, do you need a ride home?

1563
01:22:39.390 --> 01:22:42.685
No. It's only 2:30.
I'm gonna go back in the party.

1564
01:22:42.852 --> 01:22:44.521
Okay.

1565
01:22:44.688 --> 01:22:46.064
Peace it.

1566
01:22:46.231 --> 01:22:48.400
R-O-C-K in the U.S.A.

1567
01:23:04.711 --> 01:23:06.088
Hello?

1568
01:23:06.797 --> 01:23:07.840
Hello?

1569
01:23:08.007 --> 01:23:09.717
- Is this Fred Searing?
- No.

1570
01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:12.262
This is Trooper Frioli
of the Massachusetts State Police.

1571
01:23:12.429 --> 01:23:16.100
No, it's a friend of his. I just picked
up his phone. Is everything okay?

1572
01:23:23.609 --> 01:23:24.610
Yes, Rick. More tongue.

1573
01:23:25.986 --> 01:23:27.029
Oh, God.

1574
01:23:27.197 --> 01:23:28.281
Oh, yeah.

1575
01:23:28.448 --> 01:23:29.991
More tongue. More tongue.

1576
01:23:38.543 --> 01:23:40.462
There he is. Hey.

1577
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:41.755
What are you doing here?

1578
01:23:41.963 --> 01:23:44.300
What do you think?
I'm looking for my aunt.

1579
01:23:44.467 --> 01:23:46.093
Your aunt's staying here?

1580
01:23:47.762 --> 01:23:49.932
I know you and her are hooking up.

1581
01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:52.976
What? Paige, I have no idea
What you're talking about.

1582
01:23:53.143 --> 01:23:55.188
This is really bad timing.
I gotta get going.

1583
01:23:55.355 --> 01:23:58.608
Look, I saw her car in the parking lot.
I know she's here.

1584
01:23:58.775 --> 01:24:00.569
Okay, Paige. Enough, please.

1585
01:24:00.736 --> 01:24:02.863
Just because your wife
isn't faithful to you...

1586
01:24:03.030 --> 01:24:05.992
...doesn't mean you have to go around
screwing my family.

1587
01:24:08.161 --> 01:24:09.579
What?

1588
01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:13.876
Wow.

1589
01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:19.132
I guess somebody doesn't know
about the baseball coach.

1590
01:24:21.009 --> 01:24:22.846
Do the alphabet, Rick! Aah!

1591
01:24:26.015 --> 01:24:28.102
Fred, I need to talk to you.

1592
01:24:28.894 --> 01:24:31.355
Fred? I thought you were Rick.

1593
01:24:31.522 --> 01:24:33.525
No, I'm Rick.

1594
01:24:34.317 --> 01:24:36.319
- What?
- Please don't judge me.

1595
01:24:37.737 --> 01:24:41.033
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What did
they say? Is Grace gonna be okay?

1596
01:24:41.200 --> 01:24:44.454
They said she was in a car accident
and they took her to the hospital.

1597
01:24:44.621 --> 01:24:46.874
They wouldn't say any more
because I'm not you.

1598
01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:50.795
- All right. Calm down.
- This is my fault.

1599
01:24:50.962 --> 01:24:53.882
God is punishing me because
I'm the worst husband in the world.

1600
01:24:54.048 --> 01:24:55.551
No, you're not. Come on, come on.

1601
01:24:55.718 --> 01:24:58.053
Yes, I am. I've been bad, Rick.
I've been real bad.

1602
01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:01.057
- We've both been bad.
- I kissed your babysitter's aunt.

1603
01:25:01.224 --> 01:25:02.350
That's not so bad.

1604
01:25:02.517 --> 01:25:03.643
- On the vagina.
- Ooh.

1605
01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:06.647
- Oh!
- Whoa.

1606
01:25:06.814 --> 01:25:09.233
- No, no! No. Ooh.
- Hey! Oh!

1607
01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.526
Hey, what the hell?

1608
01:25:10.693 --> 01:25:11.737
No, no! No!

1609
01:25:11.945 --> 01:25:13.739
How do you like me now, Splenda boy?

1610
01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:15.449
Moron, this is my car!

1611
01:25:16.033 --> 01:25:18.411
- Oh. This is your car?
- Yes!

1612
01:25:18.578 --> 01:25:20.246
I'm sorry, I had no idea.

1613
01:25:20.413 --> 01:25:21.498
Hey! Hey!

1614
01:25:21.664 --> 01:25:23.959
You think I give a shit, pudge boy?

1615
01:25:24.126 --> 01:25:25.419
Why am I pudge boy?

1616
01:25:25.586 --> 01:25:28.088
Take it easy, okay? Relax.

1617
01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:29.382
No! You take it easy!

1618
01:25:29.549 --> 01:25:31.510
You think that you can
come into my club...

1619
01:25:31.676 --> 01:25:33.595
...take my girl
and then get away with it?

1620
01:25:33.763 --> 01:25:34.972
No. Not tonight, buddy.

1621
01:25:35.139 --> 01:25:37.934
But why would you even try to have sex
with the right Rick? He was mine.

1622
01:25:38.100 --> 01:25:39.811
- Ugh.
- Fuck, no!

1623
01:25:39.978 --> 01:25:41.563
You're not gonna get away with it!

1624
01:25:41.772 --> 01:25:43.398
- Never! Ever!
- Hey! Hey!

1625
01:25:43.607 --> 01:25:45.235
Brent?

1626
01:25:46.236 --> 01:25:47.695
Mother?

1627
01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:52.493
- What are you doing here?
- Wait, wait, wait. Aunt Meg is your mom?

1628
01:25:55.037 --> 01:25:56.706
How does he know your name?

1629
01:25:56.873 --> 01:25:59.167
- Well-- Kind of--
- We-- Sort of--

1630
01:25:59.334 --> 01:26:02.129
What? No. No, no, no.

1631
01:26:02.296 --> 01:26:03.923
No.

1632
01:26:04.131 --> 01:26:06.300
No. Are you telling me...

1633
01:26:06.509 --> 01:26:10.681
...that this 40-hour-week motherfucking
soccer dad took my girl...

1634
01:26:10.848 --> 01:26:12.600
...and this flabby asshole...

1635
01:26:14.060 --> 01:26:15.103
...my mother?

1636
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:17.438
No, no, no!
I didn't have sex with your mom.

1637
01:26:17.857 --> 01:26:21.318
- All I did was fake-chow her. All right?
- It's true.

1638
01:26:22.653 --> 01:26:25.991
- That's it. You two are dead men.
- Whoa! He's got a gun!

1639
01:26:26.157 --> 01:26:27.784
- No!
- What?

1640
01:26:27.993 --> 01:26:29.954
- Where did you get that?
- Grandpa's closet!

1641
01:26:32.164 --> 01:26:33.165
No! Brent!

1642
01:26:33.332 --> 01:26:35.669
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1643
01:26:36.295 --> 01:26:37.671
Go, go, go.

1644
01:26:40.008 --> 01:26:42.385
Go, go, go. Get down.

1645
01:26:42.552 --> 01:26:44.387
Am I scaring you, asshole?

1646
01:26:44.554 --> 01:26:45.931
Do you have a shot count?

1647
01:26:46.098 --> 01:26:47.433
- A shot count?
- Yeah!

1648
01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:49.643
No, I didn't get a fucking shot count.

1649
01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:51.104
Come here.

1650
01:26:52.606 --> 01:26:54.983
- Huh?
- Aah!

1651
01:26:56.694 --> 01:26:58.946
Shooter down. Let's roll!

1652
01:27:02.618 --> 01:27:04.161
- Go, go. Punch it. Punch it.
- I'm going.

1653
01:27:04.328 --> 01:27:06.038
- Get off me, Mom.
- Brent, stop it.

1654
01:27:09.042 --> 01:27:11.377
Oh, hell, no!

1655
01:27:14.381 --> 01:27:15.549
What the hell was that?

1656
01:27:15.716 --> 01:27:17.051
Go, go. Drive.

1657
01:27:18.803 --> 01:27:21.890
- He's coming through the back.
- What's up, assholes?

1658
01:27:22.057 --> 01:27:24.101
Swerve! Swerve! Swerve!

1659
01:27:28.397 --> 01:27:30.943
Okay. No, no. He's gone. Drive. Drive.
You shook him.

1660
01:27:33.237 --> 01:27:37.033
I don't believe this.
Maggie's having an affair.

1661
01:27:38.076 --> 01:27:39.202
What?

1662
01:27:43.165 --> 01:27:45.919
Well, you didn't give him a free pass
for nothing.

1663
01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:51.801
So come on. Just be honest.
What were you trying to accomplish?

1664
01:27:52.802 --> 01:27:54.387
I don't know.

1665
01:27:54.554 --> 01:27:56.597
I just felt like...

1666
01:27:59.852 --> 01:28:01.603
...he wasn't noticing me anymore.

1667
01:28:01.770 --> 01:28:06.067
And I wanted to feel wanted again.

1668
01:28:07.610 --> 01:28:12.449
And the truth is, I never really
thought he'd go through with it.

1669
01:28:22.962 --> 01:28:24.715
Oh, my God.

1670
01:28:24.882 --> 01:28:26.341
What?

1671
01:28:26.508 --> 01:28:28.719
This hall pass.

1672
01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:33.474
It was never for him.

1673
01:28:37.354 --> 01:28:38.772
It was for me.

1674
01:28:40.482 --> 01:28:42.485
I got a hall pass. Why shouldn't she?

1675
01:28:42.652 --> 01:28:44.154
She's a beautiful woman.

1676
01:28:44.321 --> 01:28:46.949
What guy isn't gonna wanna be
with a beautiful woman...

1677
01:28:47.158 --> 01:28:49.702
...whose husband decides
he's gonna take a week off?

1678
01:28:49.869 --> 01:28:53.457
Come on! what kind of hospital
doesn't have a live operator?

1679
01:28:53.665 --> 01:28:55.542
Fred! Fred, it's 4 a. m.

1680
01:28:56.501 --> 01:28:59.505
Uh-huh. And uh-huh.

1681
01:29:04.970 --> 01:29:08.474
Huh. There's something
you don't see a lot.

1682
01:29:09.017 --> 01:29:14.106
I took her for granted.
I took Maggie for granted. Yeah.

1683
01:29:14.941 --> 01:29:16.734
I feel like I'm gonna throw up, man.

1684
01:29:18.110 --> 01:29:19.362
Oh, great.

1685
01:29:19.529 --> 01:29:22.366
- Okay, pull over, man.
- No way. I can outrun them.

1686
01:29:22.533 --> 01:29:24.076
No, you can't! Not in this thing.

1687
01:29:24.243 --> 01:29:25.411
Watch me.

1688
01:29:27.372 --> 01:29:29.457
- Okay, now we got two of them.
- I don't care!

1689
01:29:29.624 --> 01:29:32.503
- I'm not stopping till I get to Grace.
- Are you crazy?

1690
01:29:32.670 --> 01:29:34.046
Yeah, I'm crazy!

1691
01:29:34.213 --> 01:29:35.673
I'm crazy about my wife!

1692
01:29:38.301 --> 01:29:39.719
What is happening?!

1693
01:29:41.722 --> 01:29:44.767
Aah! Brent, that hurts!

1694
01:29:52.652 --> 01:29:54.529
- Hey!
- What are you doing, man?

1695
01:29:54.696 --> 01:29:58.117
Hear me out, gentlemen.
I can explain every-- Unh. Unh.

1696
01:29:58.701 --> 01:30:00.202
Hold it!

1697
01:30:00.411 --> 01:30:01.537
Aah! Aah! No!

1698
01:30:03.915 --> 01:30:05.917
No, no. Okay, okay! Aah.

1699
01:30:06.084 --> 01:30:07.627
Oh, God. Grace needs me!

1700
01:30:08.169 --> 01:30:10.339
- Take it easy, buddy.
- I won't take it easy!

1701
01:30:10.506 --> 01:30:14.302
Okay, look. I did not stop because there's
a lunatic out there trying to kill us!

1702
01:30:14.468 --> 01:30:18.056
And my wife's been in an accident,
and I need to see if she's okay!

1703
01:30:18.223 --> 01:30:19.892
Because that woman is my life!

1704
01:30:20.058 --> 01:30:22.812
Is he the husband of Grace Searing?

1705
01:30:22.979 --> 01:30:25.565
Yes! Yes, I am. Is she okay?

1706
01:30:25.774 --> 01:30:27.902
Please.
Please, tell me she's gonna be okay.

1707
01:30:28.319 --> 01:30:30.738
She's having difficulty breathing.

1708
01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.452
Oh, my God.

1709
01:30:38.122 --> 01:30:39.290
Is she gonna live?

1710
01:30:39.457 --> 01:30:42.336
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. She's fine.
She just broke her nose.

1711
01:30:42.920 --> 01:30:44.755
We had to stuff some gauze up there.

1712
01:30:44.922 --> 01:30:47.424
She's gonna be a mouth breather
for about a week.

1713
01:30:47.634 --> 01:30:52.764
But, all in all, I would say
you're a very lucky guy.

1714
01:30:54.433 --> 01:30:55.517
Bless you, doctor.

1715
01:30:55.684 --> 01:30:57.686
I'll fucking kill you! Come here!

1716
01:30:57.853 --> 01:31:01.233
We didn't know what was going on
because he came in through the window.

1717
01:31:01.399 --> 01:31:03.068
That had been knocked out earlier...

1718
01:31:03.235 --> 01:31:05.154
...back when he fired the holes in there.

1719
01:31:05.321 --> 01:31:07.782
Rick! Rick! She's gonna be okay!

1720
01:31:07.949 --> 01:31:09.283
- She's okay?
- She's all right.

1721
01:31:09.450 --> 01:31:10.786
Hey, Anderson...

1722
01:31:11.453 --> 01:31:12.704
...these guys are clean.

1723
01:31:12.871 --> 01:31:15.291
That lunatic was attacking them
before he punched Officer Leska.

1724
01:31:16.668 --> 01:31:18.169
Anyway, he's in bracelets.

1725
01:31:18.336 --> 01:31:19.963
Well, I guess you're off the hook.

1726
01:31:20.171 --> 01:31:21.215
Thank you.

1727
01:31:21.382 --> 01:31:23.300
Can you believe it?
I get a second chance.

1728
01:31:23.467 --> 01:31:28.682
Fred, go in there and take care
of that woman. You're lucky to have her.

1729
01:31:29.432 --> 01:31:30.684
Okay. All right, thank you.

1730
01:31:30.850 --> 01:31:33.271
Put her on a pedestal.
The biggest one you can find.

1731
01:31:33.437 --> 01:31:36.190
Oh, wait! Rick, Rick, Rick.
Good luck with Mags.

1732
01:32:13.902 --> 01:32:15.905
Oh, God.

1733
01:32:16.322 --> 01:32:17.781
Oh, my God!

1734
01:32:19.491 --> 01:32:21.411
Oh, God.

1735
01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.878
Oh, my God. You poor thing.

1736
01:32:29.045 --> 01:32:31.047
Um, hold on a second.
Rick just walked in.

1737
01:32:31.505 --> 01:32:33.258
Grace has been in a car accident.

1738
01:32:33.425 --> 01:32:34.927
Yeah, I know. She's okay, though.

1739
01:32:35.093 --> 01:32:36.678
Fred's over there.

1740
01:32:36.845 --> 01:32:39.390
Oh. So they're letting you go?

1741
01:32:40.308 --> 01:32:41.517
Okay.

1742
01:32:41.684 --> 01:32:43.771
You're headed here. Great.

1743
01:32:43.979 --> 01:32:45.898
All right, I love you too.

1744
01:32:47.566 --> 01:32:49.569
God, she scared me to death.

1745
01:32:49.778 --> 01:32:51.363
Yeah.

1746
01:32:52.113 --> 01:32:53.740
Hi.

1747
01:32:54.992 --> 01:32:58.287
So, what are you doing here?

1748
01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:01.667
March 25th, 1989.

1749
01:33:03.252 --> 01:33:04.419
What?

1750
01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:08.883
That's the day I lost my virginity.
March 25th, 1989.

1751
01:33:09.259 --> 01:33:11.720
Approximately 10:30 p. m.

1752
01:33:13.472 --> 01:33:15.849
What are you talking about?
We were dating then.

1753
01:33:16.601 --> 01:33:18.770
I know. You were my first.

1754
01:33:19.646 --> 01:33:20.814
And you were my last.

1755
01:33:20.981 --> 01:33:22.858
And you've been everything in between.

1756
01:33:25.361 --> 01:33:26.487
Really?

1757
01:33:26.988 --> 01:33:28.115
Really.

1758
01:33:28.323 --> 01:33:30.158
Is that why you were crying that night?

1759
01:33:31.785 --> 01:33:35.290
I wasn't crying, I don't think.

1760
01:33:36.416 --> 01:33:38.377
And I was--?

1761
01:33:42.006 --> 01:33:43.925
I was your last?

1762
01:33:47.679 --> 01:33:49.222
You're my only.

1763
01:33:50.433 --> 01:33:52.184
Forever.

1764
01:34:02.572 --> 01:34:04.157
Whose car is that out front?

1765
01:34:04.365 --> 01:34:06.744
Oh, it's a friend of my dad.
Baseball player.

1766
01:34:06.910 --> 01:34:09.872
He came over last night.
Drank some wine.

1767
01:34:10.039 --> 01:34:13.043
He got a little frisky,
so I sent him home in a cab.

1768
01:34:13.376 --> 01:34:14.586
Define frisky.

1769
01:34:14.753 --> 01:34:18.841
Oh, don't worry. You were my last too.

1770
01:34:22.638 --> 01:34:24.598
But I can't say you were my first.

1771
01:34:24.765 --> 01:34:27.434
You know, words really do hurt.

1772
01:34:43.954 --> 01:34:47.124
So I mean, what were you doing driving
around at 1 in the morning?

1773
01:34:47.291 --> 01:34:50.379
No, I was just, um, upset about things...

1774
01:34:50.545 --> 01:34:54.424
...and I wasn't paying any attention,
and I think I must have hit some sand...

1775
01:34:54.591 --> 01:34:57.220
...and the next thing you know,
I'm running into a pole.

1776
01:34:59.097 --> 01:35:00.515
Grace.

1777
01:35:01.267 --> 01:35:02.643
I'm so sorry.

1778
01:35:02.810 --> 01:35:04.270
- For What?
- For What?

1779
01:35:04.436 --> 01:35:06.230
For putting you through all this.

1780
01:35:06.398 --> 01:35:08.275
Hey, I love you.

1781
01:35:08.441 --> 01:35:10.652
I love you too, Fred.

1782
01:35:11.278 --> 01:35:12.280
It's not your fault.

1783
01:35:12.446 --> 01:35:13.489
- Yes, it is.
- No.

1784
01:35:13.656 --> 01:35:16.450
This is all my fault.
I'm the one that caused all of this.

1785
01:35:16.617 --> 01:35:19.329
- Every single bit of this.
- "Horny old man"?

1786
01:35:19.496 --> 01:35:22.416
No. No, that's not me.
No, that was intended for Rick.

1787
01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.629
- Oh.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1788
01:35:26.796 --> 01:35:28.924
We need to talk about
what happened this week.

1789
01:35:29.091 --> 01:35:31.510
Oh, Grace, no, no. Come on,
do we really have to?

1790
01:35:31.677 --> 01:35:33.637
We really, really do.

1791
01:35:35.307 --> 01:35:39.144
Okay, look. Look, whatever happened
this week doesn't matter. Okay?

1792
01:35:39.311 --> 01:35:40.771
Because I love you and only you.

1793
01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:44.817
And I am gonna treat you like the queen
that you are for the rest of your days.

1794
01:35:44.985 --> 01:35:47.821
Okay? I'm gonna quit fantasy football
this year.

1795
01:35:47.988 --> 01:35:52.035
Even though I have the first pick.
And we can do that Master Cleanse thing...

1796
01:35:52.201 --> 01:35:56.624
...with the cayenne pepper and all that shit.
You will never have to shovel snow again.

1797
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:59.293
I'll do it, okay? Tennis elbow
be damned. I will do it.

1798
01:35:59.501 --> 01:36:01.045
But please, I am begging you...

1799
01:36:01.211 --> 01:36:04.883
...can we please just never, ever talk
about what happened this week?

1800
01:36:07.219 --> 01:36:09.388
- Um....
- Please.

1801
01:36:11.098 --> 01:36:12.559
Deal. Ha, ha.

1802
01:36:12.726 --> 01:36:14.978
- Really?
- Yeah.

1803
01:36:15.395 --> 01:36:16.480
Thank you.

1804
01:36:16.647 --> 01:36:18.149
Oh, thank you.

1805
01:36:18.316 --> 01:36:19.484
Oh, my God.

1806
01:36:19.692 --> 01:36:20.985
Oh, I love you, Grace.

1807
01:36:21.444 --> 01:36:23.321
- I love you too, Fred.
- Oh, God.

1808
01:36:26.033 --> 01:36:31.998
Does this mean that you will finally come
with me to An Evening With Kathy Griffin?

1809
01:36:34.919 --> 01:36:37.213
Last night, I fake-chowed a DJ's mom.

1810
01:37:16.259 --> 01:37:18.595
Let's talk about Miley Cyrus.
Who's got a stripper pole?

1811
01:37:20.264 --> 01:37:22.224
Oh, yes.

1812
01:37:22.433 --> 01:37:25.103
Fred, that is fantastic.

1813
01:37:25.270 --> 01:37:26.313
What's that?

1814
01:37:26.479 --> 01:37:29.316
Where did you find the Kathy Griffin
look-alike?

1815
01:37:29.482 --> 01:37:32.069
Oh, no. No, that is Kathy Griffin.

1816
01:37:32.653 --> 01:37:34.989
The Teen Awards,
where she went down there.

1817
01:37:35.157 --> 01:37:37.326
And then the dads in the audience,
they're all clapping.

1818
01:37:38.702 --> 01:37:39.870
Really?

1819
01:37:40.037 --> 01:37:42.790
Better be. Cost me 275 bucks
to get her here.

1820
01:37:43.416 --> 01:37:44.667
Plus bus fare.

1821
01:37:45.126 --> 01:37:46.962
Kathy Griffin's a delight, isn't she?

1822
01:37:47.129 --> 01:37:48.797
I've never seen them look happier.

1823
01:37:48.964 --> 01:37:51.091
- Who's that, dear?
- Maggie and Grace.

1824
01:37:51.718 --> 01:37:55.972
You know, I've been wondering
if maybe I should give you a hall pass.

1825
01:37:57.933 --> 01:37:59.185
That was amazing.

1826
01:37:59.352 --> 01:38:03.190
Thank you. It's nice finally to meet a
woman who's not obsessed with penis size.

1827
01:38:03.357 --> 01:38:04.941
I appreciate that.

1828
01:38:05.651 --> 01:38:07.277
- What the fuck is this?
- My husband!

1829
01:38:07.444 --> 01:38:09.197
Why are you with my wife?

1830
01:38:09.364 --> 01:38:11.616
- I've got hall pass. I have a hall pass.
- He's got a gun!

1831
01:38:11.783 --> 01:38:12.784
Aah!

1832
01:38:16.288 --> 01:38:19.292
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
What if the cops question me?

1833
01:38:19.668 --> 01:38:20.794
I'm weak.

1834
01:38:25.591 --> 01:38:30.096
Excuse me?
Have you seen my granddaughter?

1835
01:38:36.688 --> 01:38:38.648
Dude, up here.

1836
01:38:38.815 --> 01:38:42.528
That was fucking awesome.
We saw the whole thing.

1837
01:38:45.864 --> 01:38:48.702
This is racial profiling!
I wanna speak to a barrister!

1838
01:38:57.044 --> 01:38:59.172
So, what do you think?

1839
01:39:00.841 --> 01:39:02.926
Yeah. We'll give it a whirl. Why not?

1840
01:39:03.845 --> 01:39:09.351
Subrip & Sync: easytobeaman

1841
01:43:27.197 --> 01:43:32.328
Tonight's the night we'll make history

1842
01:43:32.495 --> 01:43:35.123
Honey, you and I

1843
01:43:38.711 --> 01:43:40.838
'Cause I'll take any risk

1844
01:43:41.047 --> 01:43:46.011
To tie back the hands of time

1845
01:43:47.805 --> 01:43:50.934
And stay with you here tonight

1846
01:43:59.068 --> 01:44:00.529
Huh?

1847
01:44:02.864 --> 01:44:04.241
Excuse me.

1848
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:06.035
What are you doing?

1849
01:44:06.869 --> 01:44:08.871
It's not what you think. I swear.

1850
01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:10.707
I was just giving him a faux job.

1851
01:44:10.873 --> 01:44:11.875
Yeah. A What?

1852
01:44:12.584 --> 01:44:14.128
A faux job.

1853
01:44:14.712 --> 01:44:17.507
When you go south on a guy,
but you don't use your mouth...

1854
01:44:17.674 --> 01:44:21.803
...you use your hands instead,
and then you make loud slurping noises.

1855
01:44:27.101 --> 01:44:28.228
Hmm.

1856
01:44:28.395 --> 01:44:30.313
Okay. Have a good night.

1857
01:44:30.480 --> 01:44:33.776
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Yeah. Night.

1858
01:44:34.485 --> 01:44:36.988
- They're nice, yeah?
- Yep.

1859
01:44:47.876 --> 01:44:50.546
Yeah, you're out of breath, Stephen.

1860
01:44:52.548 --> 01:44:55.761
And, action.

1861
01:44:58.430 --> 01:45:00.307
Fucking hell.

1862
01:45:01.184 --> 01:45:02.226
Wow.

1863
01:45:05.354 --> 01:45:06.481
Wow.

1864
01:45:08.150 --> 01:45:10.277
Good job, dude.

1865
01:45:10.861 --> 01:45:12.739
All right, well, good luck
finishing your movie.

1866
01:45:14.824 --> 01:45:17.327
I gotta change my drawers.
