-It's okay.

180
00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:24.396

I mean, to walk 20 miles for water,

181
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:26.732
and then to suddenly discover
that you're menstruating?

182
00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.901
-Oh, my God. I could not stop crying.
-Me, too.

183
00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.861
I literally could not stop crying.

184
00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:32.863
Me, too, but figuratively.

185
00:09:33.323 --> 00:09:36.283
No. No, literally.

186
00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.621
I literally could not stop crying.

187
00:09:41.206 --> 00:09:42.206
Quite sad.

188
00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:46.710
-Quite sad?
-Mmm.

189
00:09:46.836 --> 00:09:49.296
What he means is it's really very moving.

190
00:09:49.381 --> 00:09:50.631
Yeah.

191
00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:55.177
You have no idea what it is like

192

193

194
00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:05.813
That is true.

195

-Yes, please. Yes. Thank you.

-Yeah.

00:10:24.624 --> 00:10:26.083
PHIL: You should really read this.

202

getting her period in the desert.

to still do those book clubs, buddy.

you don't wanna do.

-Not me. Not anymore.
-What... What do you mean?

207
00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:40.806

-But you guys are happy.
-No, Phil, we're not.

210
00:10:46.104 --> 00:10:48.522
No, no, no. No, you guys are really happy.

211
00:10:48.606 --> 00:10:50.983
No, Phil, we're really not.

212
00:10:51.067 --> 00:10:55.612
Brad, okay, well,
why are we here, then, in your house,

213
00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.657
-having book club?
-I haven't told the kids.

214
00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.368
Can't tell the kids.

215
00:11:01.453 --> 00:11:03.495
Just, please, keep it under your hat
until next week

216
00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:05.664
when we go public with it. Don't tell Claire.

217
00:11:05.749 --> 00:11:10.586
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, what happened? I mean...

218
00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:13.172
I thought everything was fine. Really.

219
00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.966
The next thing I know,
Haley starts getting more and more distant,

220
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.677
and eventually she tells me,
and I'm quoting here,

221
00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:22.431
"I'm... I'm strangling
in the noose of sameness."

222
00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.892
So, at first, I was pissed. I really was.

223
00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.019
But then I realized,
I know what she's talking about, okay.

224
00:11:27.103 --> 00:11:28.937
We're just cemented
in these roles together,

225
00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.314
and there's no breaking out of it.

00:11:30.398 --> 00:11:31.482

227
00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:34.651

-Gedde Watanabe.

230

No matter how hard he tries,
he can't play a doctor.

231
00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.579
Oh, yeah. No. It'd be like,

232
00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.581
"Why is Long Duk Dong
dressed up like a doctor?"

233
00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.209
Right? And that's us!

234
00:11:50.794 --> 00:11:54.755
We're stuck.
We're just stuck in these roles,

235
00:11:54.839 --> 00:11:56.965
this routine, and it's...

236
00:11:57.592 --> 00:12:00.761
I mean, we're not even a couple anymore.
We're just, like...

237
00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.974
We're just excellent roommates.

238
00:12:06.059 --> 00:12:08.102
The most excellent roommates.

239
00:12:08.812 --> 00:12:13.816
-I... I don't think you're Long Duk Dong.
-What do you think?

240
00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:21.407
I know that Haley
must be hurting right now.

241
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:24.618
And I'm betting you
she's gonna change her mind.

242

243

you and Phil actually danced together?

246
00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:37.756
I don't know. Our wedding?

247
00:12:37.841 --> 00:12:40.884
Okay, well, I wanna dance every night.

248
00:12:40.969 --> 00:12:42.761
And I wanna take my top off,

249
00:12:42.846 --> 00:12:45.013
and I wanna get it on
with three guys at the same time

250
00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.098

251
00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.808
Three guys at once? That's a nightmare.

252

a recurring stress dream that I have.

-Oh, no. I got it.
-Yeah, there's that one.

I know that croutons make him gag.

260
00:13:11.082 --> 00:13:13.292

-You're still doing that, huh?
-Yes.

the same schedule.

-Yes, you are. Yes, you are.

Why are we talking about me?
You're the one going crazy.

271
00:13:41.571 --> 00:13:44.948

Because you are ashamed

-Oh, come on...

274

00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:34.699
don't use the same alias
as your ransom notes, you dick.

500
00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.117

501
00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:39.037
CLAIRE: Listen, we are just a regular,
boring couple from New Jersey.

502
00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:42.957
-Let's just get this done.
-Get what done? What do you want?

503
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:44.375
You know what we want.

504
00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.127
-We don't actually. We really don't.
-No, we don't.

505
00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:48.546
You know what we want.

506
00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:51.966
We want the flash drive!

507
00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:55.136
All right, all right, all right! Okay, I'm sorry.

508
00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:59.349
Did you really think you could steal
from Joe Miletto and get away with it?

509
00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:02.644
Okay, someone somewhere
is making a huge mistake.

510
00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.896
-Yeah, guys. Seriously, this is...
-This is a mistake.

511
00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.232
This is just a big, big,
goofy misunderstanding.

512
00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:09.609
-Yeah.
-We are Phil and Claire Foster.

513
00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:12.111
We don't know anything
about a ransom note.

514
00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:14.405
-We don't have a flash drive, I assure you.
-No.

515
00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.573
You were sitting at the table.

516
00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:17.784
The girl at the front said
you were the Tripplehorns.

517
00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:20.411
-No, no, no, no.
-Okay, let me... Okay. Let me explain.

518
00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:23.414
My husband, very sweetly, but delusionally,

519
00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:26.167
thought that we could
make it here early enough to get a table.

520
00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:27.752
And we didn't. We were late,

521
00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:30.838
because he won't listen
to the lady in the car,

522
00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:33.800
-so they were very rude to us.
-They were so rude! That one guy...

523
00:26:33.884 --> 00:26:36.386
And when we heard them
calling the reservation for Tripplehorns,

524
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.263
-he was, like, "Us! Us!"
-"Us! Us!" That's...

525
00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:40.223
CLAIRE: And so we took it.
PHIL: Just going for it.

526
00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:41.474
And then we had a great time.

527
00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:42.767
I'm not gonna lie to you.
We had a great time.

528
00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:45.478
-So much fun.
-The food, unbelievable.

529
00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:46.938
-So good.
-So good.

530
00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:49.107
-But then you came over...
-We had this rice thing...

531
00:26:49.191 --> 00:26:51.693
Look, shut up! I don't wanna hear that.

532
00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:55.196
So you just took
somebody else's reservation?

533
00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:56.614
-For the record, I was against it.
-I...

534
00:26:56.699 --> 00:26:58.408
But my husband gets
these plans in his head,

535
00:26:58.492 --> 00:27:01.202
-and it becomes, like, a thing.
-I'm an idiot sometimes.

536
00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:02.912
Shut up. Shut up.

537
00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.583
-I believe you're the Fosters.
-Thank you.

538
00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:10.086
I also believe
you go by the alias "Tripplehorn"

539
00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.796
-and that you stole my boss's property.
-No. No.

540
00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.173
And now you're just
too scared shitless to admit it.

541
00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:17.385
So I will give you three seconds
to give us back the flash drive!

542
00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.137
What... Okay. The three seconds game?

543
00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:21.389
Sorry, sir. But, you know,
I play this every day with my kids.

-That's not scary.

-One...

-That's a kill shot! God!

-He's gonna kill us both! What?
-I've got the flash drive.

554
00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:45.079
-Thought so.
-Where is it?

555
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.542
It's in the park.

556
00:27:49.626 --> 00:27:53.087
-The park?
-Could you be more specific?

557

Okay, this is what's gonna happen.

We're all gonna take
a little field trip to the Central Park,

exactly where it is. Okay?

00:35:12.194 --> 00:35:13.778
I'm not out of shape, I'm scared!

666
00:35:13.862 --> 00:35:16.572
Oh, my God. Me, too. Me, too.

667
00:35:17.032 --> 00:35:18.282
-You done?
-Mmm-hmm.

668
00:35:18.366 --> 00:35:20.493
-Okay.
-(VOMITING)

669
00:35:20.911 --> 00:35:23.287
Okay. Let it out.

670
00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:26.957
Let it all out.

671
00:35:27.542 --> 00:35:31.086
-Oh, my God. Are you bleeding?
-(GAGGING) It's the cabernet.

672
00:35:31.171 --> 00:35:33.214
Okay. We gotta go.

673
00:35:34.966 --> 00:35:37.301
I'm sorry. Do you have any gum?

674
00:35:38.303 --> 00:35:39.303
CLAIRE: Gum?

675
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.931
....precinct, Callahan speaking.

676
00:35:42.182 --> 00:35:44.183
ARROYO: I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to forgive me.

677
00:35:44.267 --> 00:35:46.101
I've already been on nine hours.

678
00:35:46.186 --> 00:35:49.563
So, one more time,
you were out at dinner where?

679
00:35:49.856 --> 00:35:50.898
At Claw.

680
00:35:50.982 --> 00:35:55.736
Claw. That place in TriBeCa with the $50
soup? How'd that work out for you?

681
00:35:56.071 --> 00:35:58.489
Not great. We couldn't get a table,

682
00:35:58.573 --> 00:36:00.699
so we ended up taking
somebody else's reservation.

683
00:36:02.035 --> 00:36:05.329
-You took someone's reservation?
-Yeah. Yeah. We took it...

684
00:36:05.413 --> 00:36:06.997
You just took a table?

685
00:36:07.082 --> 00:36:10.000
-(SCOFFS) Just like that?
-We know. Shocking.

686
00:36:10.085 --> 00:36:11.669
I was against it.

687
00:36:11.753 --> 00:36:16.006
Yeah. So, we're in the middle of dinner,
and these guys come up.

688
00:36:16.091 --> 00:36:17.925
Turns out these guys work for Joe Miletto.

689
00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:19.552
-Joe Miletto?
-That's what they said.

690
00:36:19.636 --> 00:36:21.136
But we didn't know that at the time.

691
00:36:21.221 --> 00:36:23.138
We thought they were
just guys from the restaurant.

692
00:36:23.223 --> 00:36:27.142
So we followed them into the alley,
and suddenly they just grab all of our stuff.

693
00:36:27.227 --> 00:36:28.686
That's why we don't have our IDs on us.

694
00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:29.854
(GASPING)

695
00:36:29.938 --> 00:36:31.605
Then... Yeah, it was scary. What?

696
00:36:31.690 --> 00:36:36.026
Then they start waving the guns around,
and they're talking about a flash drive.

697
00:36:36.111 --> 00:36:38.779
-Honey, why are you grabbing my knee?
-Because I just remembered

698
00:36:38.864 --> 00:36:42.324
that we are supposed to meet our friends,
who are a gay couple.

699
00:36:42.409 --> 00:36:44.660
The ones we met while night boating?

700
00:36:47.163 --> 00:36:49.498
Oh, my God!

701
00:36:49.583 --> 00:36:53.419
The bald and the crazy gay couple date...

702
00:36:53.503 --> 00:36:58.549
Shit my pants,
we forgot our gay couple dinner.

703
00:36:58.633 --> 00:37:00.426
-Oh, God!
-Can I say something here?

704
00:37:00.510 --> 00:37:01.552
Mmm-hmm.

705
00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:03.387
-Hello! Up here.
-PHIL: Yeah.

706
00:37:03.471 --> 00:37:06.724
-You two seem like a really nice couple.
-Thank you.

707
00:37:06.808 --> 00:37:09.268
Joe Miletto is not a nice man.

708
00:37:09.352 --> 00:37:13.731
Okay, take it from me.
He is genuinely a really mean, scary guy.

709
00:37:13.815 --> 00:37:16.901
Okay?
So if you're somehow blinking on his radar,

710
00:37:16.985 --> 00:37:18.986
we need to talk about
how we can help you.

711
00:37:19.070 --> 00:37:21.071
No, no, no. You don't understand.

712
00:37:21.156 --> 00:37:22.656
We took somebody's reservations.

713
00:37:22.741 --> 00:37:24.241
It was a terrible, terrible thing to do.

714
00:37:24.326 --> 00:37:25.618
So we need to leave
and ponder what we've done.

715
00:37:25.702 --> 00:37:27.494
-Honey, let's go.
-Stop!

716
00:37:27.746 --> 00:37:29.163
Sit down!

717
00:37:30.165 --> 00:37:33.751
Okay, you two can't be this weird.
What is going on?

718
00:37:37.005 --> 00:37:38.172
-Arroyo?
-Yeah.

719
00:37:38.256 --> 00:37:40.591
-Give me a second?
-Okay.

720
00:37:40.675 --> 00:37:44.386
Look, I'll be right back.
You two stay put, okay?

721
00:37:44.471 --> 00:37:46.013
Get your story together.

722
00:37:49.309 --> 00:37:51.018
Go, go, go, go!

723
00:38:00.070 --> 00:38:02.821
Oh, my God! Now the bad guys
are dressed up like cops.

724
00:38:02.906 --> 00:38:04.907
That's because the bad guys are cops.

725
00:38:07.327 --> 00:38:10.663
Why are there cops involved?
What is going on, Phil?

726
00:38:10.956 --> 00:38:14.458
-What are we going to do?
-Honey, honey,

727
00:38:14.542 --> 00:38:16.251
-it's okay. Just breathe.
-They are gonna kill us

728
00:38:16.336 --> 00:38:19.129
-and put our bodies in trash bags.
-No. It's gonna be all right. Just breathe.

729
00:38:19.214 --> 00:38:21.590
CLAIRE: They're gonna find us
where Giuliani put the homeless people.

730
00:38:21.675 --> 00:38:23.884
-Just breathe. Are you breathing?
-Only in.

731
00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:26.720
Honey, focus. Focus. Focus.

732
00:38:26.846 --> 00:38:28.555
Are you focusing?

733
00:38:29.516 --> 00:38:31.892
Okay. Okay.

734
00:38:32.352 --> 00:38:34.937
-Your eyes look crazy.
-I know, because I'm losing it.

735
00:38:35.021 --> 00:38:37.439
What are we gonna do? I'm losing it!
What are we gonna do?

736
00:38:37.524 --> 00:38:40.901
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

737
00:38:40.986 --> 00:38:43.153
We gotta get out of here.
We gotta go home.

738
00:38:43.238 --> 00:38:45.364
-We can't go home.
-What are you talking about, Phil?

739
00:38:45.448 --> 00:38:47.825
I am going home. I'm going home!

740
00:38:47.909 --> 00:38:50.744
Claire, they have our IDs.
They know where we live.

741
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:52.579
They know where we live.

742
00:38:53.289 --> 00:38:55.749
-Oh, my God. The kids.
-Oh, my God.

743
00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.129
(PHONE RINGING)

744
00:39:00.213 --> 00:39:02.548
-Hello?
-Hai-ya! Hai-ya!

745
00:39:06.553 --> 00:39:07.511
Hello?

746
00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:09.555
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Do you accept a collect phone call from...

747
00:39:09.639 --> 00:39:11.265
CLAIRE: Oh, my God!
This phone smells like urine!

748
00:39:11.349 --> 00:39:12.850
Yes, I... I accept.

749
00:39:12.934 --> 00:39:15.269
-Katy?
-Fosters, what up?

750
00:39:15.353 --> 00:39:17.021
Katy, are the kids okay?

751
00:39:17.105 --> 00:39:19.273
-Is everything okay?
-KATY: Yeah.

752
00:39:19.357 --> 00:39:22.609
Okay, listen to me. I'm gonna need you
to stay a little late tonight.

753
00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:25.529
-That is gonna be a problem for me.
-What?

754
00:39:25.613 --> 00:39:27.364
I actually have a party to get to.

755
00:39:27.449 --> 00:39:30.743
No. Why would you be going to a party?
You're babysitting.

756
00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:34.246
Yeah, I mean, you guys are the Fosters.
You're always home by 9:30.

757
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.582
Yeah, well, tonight, it just so happens

758
00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:38.917
that we're gonna be staying out
a little bit later.

759
00:39:39.002 --> 00:39:41.378
Nice. But I already promised my friends.

760
00:39:41.463 --> 00:39:43.714
-Could you talk to her?
-Okay. Okay.

761
00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:45.799
-Katy? Hi, it's Phil.
-Hi.

762
00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:47.384
Where's that frigging guy
when you need him?

763
00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:49.970
Katy, I don't have time to talk right now.
I'll pay you double to stay.

764
00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:52.389
That's really nice of you,
but I don't think that's gonna close it.

765
00:39:52.474 --> 00:39:53.557
Are you kidding me?

766
00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:55.225
-What? What is she saying?
-She's saying...

767
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.811
What is that little bitch saying?
Herjeans are too tight!

768
00:39:57.896 --> 00:40:01.482
You see, the thing is, my dad's been saying
I should jack your rate for a while now.

769
00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:03.734
So, I could miss the party,

770
00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:06.779
but, I think, rate-wise,
we're talking somewhere north of 30.

771
00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:08.238
I see them.

772
00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:10.574
-Pay it!
-Okay, fine. Fine. Katy, that's fine.

773
00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:12.618
Just get the kids out of the house
right now.

774
00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:14.453
Don't go out the front door.
Go out the back door.

775
00:40:14.537 --> 00:40:15.662
Take them over to your house.

776
00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:17.498
Okay, now I'm sensing
some kind of element of danger here.

777
00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:18.624
No. No.

778
00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:20.334
'Cause that's gonna run you
an extra five per.

779
00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.252
Fine! Fine! Just get the kids out right now!

780
00:40:22.337 --> 00:40:24.463
Tell them we love them
and everything is gonna be okay!

781
00:40:24.547 --> 00:40:26.048
Everything's okay! Tell them we love them.

782
00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:27.424
-Bye.
-Okay.

783
00:40:27.509 --> 00:40:29.176
Sucker. Kids!

784
00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:30.677
-Now what?
-They're safe. They're safe.

785
00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:33.472
We need to find someplace
with a lot of people. A lot of people.

786
00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:44.274
Hi, hi. Excuse me.

787
00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:46.443
Don't worry, we're not going to hurt you.

788
00:40:46.528 --> 00:40:49.279
Our names are Claire and Phil Foster.

789
00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:53.408
We are from New Jersey,
and through a series of strange events,

790
00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:55.536
we have been confused with someone else.

791
00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.789
And now, some unruly criminals,
who are also policemen...

792
00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:00.541
-Right.
-...are hunting us as prey.

793
00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:04.086
Again, we're not the bad guys, they are.
We're not going to hurt you.

794
00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.546
Honey, stop saying that,
'cause it makes it sound

795
00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.589
-like we are gonna hurt them.
-No, no. They get it.

796
00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:10.926
We need a place to hole up and hide,
and we don't have any money

797
00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.428
because these criminals, these dirty cops...

798
00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:15.848
Hey, hey.
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

799
00:41:15.932 --> 00:41:17.891
Okay, this is the oldest scam in the book.

800
00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:19.143
Beat it, junkies.

801
00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:20.769
-MAN: They make me sick.
-So dirty.

802
00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:22.563
Let's go.

803
00:41:22.856 --> 00:41:24.523
We are on our own.

804
00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:29.194
This whole night was a mistake.

805
00:41:29.279 --> 00:41:31.822
We never should've come in to this city.
This was a crazy idea.

806
00:41:31.906 --> 00:41:34.992
It wasn't a crazy idea.
It was just dinner in Manhattan.

807
00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:37.828
One night, one date where we're just not
talking about the kids the entire time

808
00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.414
-or what we have to do next week.
-And look where it got us.

809
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.040
We should call 91 1 .

810
00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:44.042
Honey, this is Joe Miletto
we're talking about.

811
00:41:44.127 --> 00:41:46.461
-So?
-So? Those cops that tried to kill us?

812
00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:47.963
They're in his pocket.

813
00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:50.883
This guy owns cops!
We can't trust any cops.

814
00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:53.802
What are we gonna do? We can't go home,
we can't go to the police...

815
00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:58.515
Okay, okay, okay.
Miletto, he wants the Tripplehorns, why?

816
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.100
Because they have the flash drive.

817
00:42:00.185 --> 00:42:03.437
All right,
what if they gave him the flash drive back?

818
00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:04.897
Why would they do that?

819
00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:07.524
Because we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna make them do it.

820
00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:09.943
Once Miletto has the flash drive,
this thing ends.

821
00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.695
Okay. I like that. I am completely with you.

822
00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:14.948
I just have to ask you one question,
and do not judge me.

823
00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.950
What is a flash drive?

824
00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:19.244
-Seriously?
-Phil, I can't...

825
00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:22.831
Okay, it's a little storage disk
that you stick in the side of a laptop.

826
00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:25.042
Oh, it's a computer sticky thing? That's...

827
00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:27.377
In my office we call it

-No, listen, anyway,

we were here, and Will.i.am thinks
he left his phone at the table,

so we need to check at the table.

Or, maybe he's
a big Jeanne Tripplehorn fan.

Doesn't even matter now, though,

1446
01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:03.058
because the computer sticky thing
is at the bottom of the East River,

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:29.834

let me break it down for you, all righty?

1457
01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:33.213
That guy over there.
Let's just say that guy is Crenshaw.

1458
01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.423
He's a DA. He's a good guy.

1459
01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:39.052
He should be busting
people like Joe Miletto.

1460
01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:42.347
He's a gangster. He's a bad guy.
He's very bad.

1461
01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.849
But Crenshaw can't bust Miletto,

1462
01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:49.271
because Crenshaw goes to Miletto's clubs
to get hookers.

1463
01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:53.733
Oh, boy, I hope she's really a hooker.
That would be amazing.

1464
01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:57.445
Now, Miletto makes
a flash drive implicating Crenshaw.

1465
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.489
Which Taste and Whippit steal

1466
01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.366
from The Peppermint Hippo,
where she works.

1467
01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:05.120
Right, they steal it
so they can blackmail the DA.

1468
01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.081
So, those two cops don't work for Miletto.
They work for Crenshaw.

1469
01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:09.165
Right.

1470
01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:12.294
And that's why Taste was acting so weird
when you mentioned Miletto's name.

1471
01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:15.130
-Right.
-Oh, my God, Phil, I totally got this.

1472
01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.799
-It has something to do with Crenshaw?
-It has...

1473
01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:19.968
Yes, honey, it has
everything to do with Crenshaw.

1474
01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.553
That's the key.

1475
01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.722
We have to find a way to get to Crenshaw.

1476
01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:27.934
Well, the Tripplehorns got to him
at The Peppermint Hippo.

1477
01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:30.812
And we're the Tripplehorns.

1478
01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.564
Hells yes, we are.

1479
01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.653
We're gonna need some help.

1480
01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:40.405
Oh, "whacked off"! Oh! Oh, God.

1481
01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.240
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah.

1482
01:17:46.412 --> 01:17:48.163
Hi.

1483
01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:50.373
Is that my tracksuit?

1484
01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.418
Yes, it was in the trunk of your Audi,

1485
01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.712
which is now parked
over by the East River,

1486
01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:59.341
and is probably
in need of significant repair,

1487
01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.676
for which I'm sure
I'll be able to pay you back

1488
01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:04.429
over the next several decades.
Also, on my tab,

1489
01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:08.767
I would like to add that super old gun
that I stole from your hallway,

1490
01:18:08.851 --> 01:18:11.644
which, incidentally, was not very useful.

1491
01:18:11.729 --> 01:18:13.438
It just went... (EXHALES)

1492
01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:15.357
PHIL: But that's not the reason we're here.

1493
01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:18.651
As impossible as this may be
to believe, Holbrooke,

1494
01:18:18.736 --> 01:18:23.365
our night has actually gotten weirder
since we saw you last.

1495
01:18:23.449 --> 01:18:26.409
There were cars, then we...
They got hooked, and...

1496
01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:27.869
One of them was your car. Anyway...

1497
01:18:27.953 --> 01:18:29.704
I've had an interesting night myself.

1498
01:18:29.789 --> 01:18:32.791
And I'm really tired, so as nice as it was
to see you again, Claire,

1499
01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.834
how about you two
go knock on somebody else's door, okay?

1500
01:18:34.919 --> 01:18:37.462
-No...
-No, no, no. No. Here's the thing.

1501
01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.716
I just wanted
to take my wife to dinner tonight.

1502
01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:45.053
I was just hoping
that we would have one night

1503
01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:49.641
where we could, you know, feel like new.

1504
01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:53.478
And now, all I want to do is get us home.

1505
01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:57.190
And I've got a plan.
I've got a way to do that.

1506
01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.568
I'm not very good with plans generally,
but I've got one.

1507
01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.779
And I need help.

1508
01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:05.490
And even though your pecs
make me wanna kill myself,

1509
01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:09.411
and your girlfriend is so hot it's like
looking through a shimmering jet engine,

1510
01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:14.165
I know, and I believe,
that there is a real person

1511
01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.961
that understands exactly
what I'm going through right now.

1512
01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:22.173
So, please, Holbrooke,
will you let us come in?

1513
01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:27.095
Will you let us explain to you
what we want?

1514
01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:32.559
And will you, for the love of God,

1515
01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:34.936
put on a fucking shirt?

1516
01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.987
-Come on in.
-(SOFTLY) Thank you.

1517
01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.841
-PHIL: Here it is. Remember the plan?
-Barely.

1518
01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:18.146
Let us in. This is a new girl.
She's working tonight.

1519
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.899
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm the new girl.

1520
01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.109
-Really?
-(FIRMLY) Yeah.

1521
01:20:23.194 --> 01:20:25.987
-And who are you?
-I am her pimp daddy.

1522
01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.822
(SCOFFS) You're her pimp?

1523
01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.116
That right.

1524
01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:33.286
-Really?
-Yeah, dummy, he's my pimp.

1525
01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:34.871
So can I go inside and start my shift,

1526
01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:39.250
or do I have to call Joey Miletto
and tell him that his bellboy made me late?

1527
01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.675
(WHISPERING) I don't really have gum.

1528
01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:51.679
-The locker rooms are on the left.
-Come on, pimp.

-(WHISPERING) Wait right here.
-Where are you going?

1531
01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.376
Hey, do you have anything in a size eight?

1532
01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.087
What? Gross. No.

Oh, no. That's for a monkey.

Okay.

Hey, I'm a man on the bottom.
You into that?

1537
01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:50.738
I'm sorry. I... Oh, my God!

1538
01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.907
I know. I know. Shut up. It's...

1539
01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:54.492
You look awesome!

1540
01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:58.204
Why is it so bright out here?
It's supposed to be dark and seedy.

1541
01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:01.457
Give a 40-year-old stripper/mom a break.

1542
01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:04.210
Look at your boobs!

1543
01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:06.796
I had to put it on backwards and spin it.

1544
01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.256
I think I lost a nipple.

1545
01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.675
No, you look great!

1546
01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.261
-For reals?
-Yeah, for reals.

1547
01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:16.347
It's the only one long enough
to cover my C-section scar.

1548
01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.601
-I cannot stop looking at your boobs.
-Come on.

-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

-Just pop it out.

Oh, that's gross. Why does he need that?

1580

Probably a lot of messes he makes in here.

Oh, I know you do. How much for a night?

$1 00,000.

that's worth that kind of money.

and talk about things privately?

Let's make this simple, okay?
You give me the flash drive,

1675
01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:18.686
or Collins is going to break
both your wife's arms.

1676
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.897
I put the flash drive someplace
no one is ever going to find it.

doesn't hear from us
every hour on the hour until we're safe,

1679
01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:30.281
then he will release
the contents of that drive.

we questioned tonight.

-Frank?

-What? Oh, my God! I am so lost.
-They were just about to leave, Joe.

1689

You know, they got a guy on the outside
that has the flash drive.

1690

Yeah, the flash drive. There's no play here.

You've seen the flash drive?

1692

Oh, don't worry, though.
We won't say a word about the pictures.

-Nothing.

-He doesn't know?
-Know what?

Oh, wow!
I kind of pulled a boner here. Sorry.

-You zip your vagina.

No. No, it's okay! When he says "vagina,"
he means your face.

You said that what was on that drive

1703
01:30:32.052 --> 01:30:34.178
were the city contracts
that I flowed your way.

I've been keeping the cops off your ass,

-and you're stashing dirty pictures of me?
-Really dirty, gross pictures.
