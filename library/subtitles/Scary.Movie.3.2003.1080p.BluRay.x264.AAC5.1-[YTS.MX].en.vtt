1
00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:26.859
...day after day you want.

2
00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.944
A store that one might...

3
00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:34.575
I hate television. It gives me headaches.

4
00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.828
You know, there's so many magnetic waves
traveling in the airspace

5
00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:39.705
because of TV and television,

6
00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:42.374
we're losing ten times as many
brain cells as we're supposed to.

7
00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:44.293
Please!

8
00:00:45.295 --> 00:00:49.173
"The cow says blank." Three letters.

9
00:00:50.258 --> 00:00:51.258
Dude!

10
00:00:51.926 --> 00:00:54.303
"Dude." I don't know.

11
00:00:54.387 --> 00:00:56.555
Magnetic waves, brain cells.

12
00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:58.640
I don't understand the connection
between all that stuff.

13
00:00:59.017 --> 00:01:00.768
You know what else I heard?

14
00:01:00.852 --> 00:01:03.187
Magnetic waves shrink silicone molecules.

15
00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:09.151
Oh, my God! Turn it off!

16
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.028
-It's not working!
-It's backwards!

17
00:01:11.154 --> 00:01:12.279
-What do we do?
-I don't know!

18
00:01:12.363 --> 00:01:13.655
Oh, God!

19
00:01:17.494 --> 00:01:20.537
Thank God. I can't afford to get any smaller.

20
00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:23.415
Come on. You're beautiful.

21
00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.584
I wish I had your legs.

22
00:01:25.668 --> 00:01:27.002
I wish I had your butt.

23
00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:29.630
-I wish I had your...
-Shaved pussy?

24
00:01:31.007 --> 00:01:32.508
Nobody's getting Snowball.

25
00:01:34.052 --> 00:01:37.763
Okay. That thing's kind of scary, anyway.

26
00:01:37.847 --> 00:01:40.182
-I know something even scarier.
-What?

27
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:41.809
Have you heard about this videotape?

28
00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:43.102
The one where they do it on the boat?

29
00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:45.104
And then in the car?
And then in the bathtub?

30
00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:48.357
And he's, like, "Hey, baby, I love you."
And she's, like, "Where are we?"

31
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.818
-And did you see the...
-No. Not that tape.

32
00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:53.445
The one with all the scary images.

33
00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.989
You know, after you watch the tape,
the phone rings,

34
00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:59.368
and this really scary voice comes on
and says you're gonna die in, like...

35
00:01:59.452 --> 00:02:01.829
Seven days.
Yeah, I saw that one with Josh last weekend.

36
00:02:02.038 --> 00:02:05.666
You were with Josh last weekend?
Oh, my God!

37
00:02:06.042 --> 00:02:07.209
My God!

38
00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:09.461
Oh, yes, I was.

39
00:02:11.172 --> 00:02:12.256
You ho!

40
00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:17.010
You know it!

41
00:02:30.567 --> 00:02:33.819
-This is really weird.
-Yeah.

42
00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.363
Big house, only one phone.

43
00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:50.127
Hello?

44
00:02:50.378 --> 00:02:54.464
I'm coming for you, my precious.

45
00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.302
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi, precious. Having fun?

46
00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:02.181
Ask her which bathroom
has a detachable showerhead.

47
00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:05.976
Anyway, we're just about to go to bed.

48
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.188
No. Not like that.

49
00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:12.774
Well, I guess a woman
would know how to touch a...

50
00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:19.114
Hello?

51
00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:20.300
Katie?

52
00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:35.774
Are you okay?

53
00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.893
God!

54
00:05:43.968 --> 00:05:45.761
Tom, did you hear...

55
00:05:46.554 --> 00:05:47.971
The dogs are acting strange.

56
00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:11.286
Sue!

57
00:06:12.455 --> 00:06:15.832
What are you doing out here?
We were worried sick.

58
00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.042
What's wrong?

59
00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.304
I wonder what they're trying to tell us.

60
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:42.067
And now, Washington, D.C.'s
leading morning news program,

61
00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:43.360
the Morning News.

62
00:06:43.694 --> 00:06:45.237
Good morning. I'm Ross Giggins.

63
00:06:45.321 --> 00:06:48.073
For our top story,
we turn now to Cindy Campbell.

64
00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:49.157
Thank you, Ross.

65
00:06:49.617 --> 00:06:52.244
There's a developing story
in Middleburg at this hour.

66
00:06:52.328 --> 00:06:57.082
A mysterious crop circle appeared
in local farmer, Tom Logan's cornfield.

67
00:06:57.166 --> 00:07:00.752
Elaborate prank
or extraterrestrial phenomenon?

68
00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:03.964
We'll update you
as soon as we have any further information,

69
00:07:04.048 --> 00:07:09.219
but, either way, it's clear something strange
is happening in that small town. Ross?

70
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:12.264
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

71
00:07:12.348 --> 00:07:14.516
Coming up, more news after this.

72
00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:18.270
-Cindy, you got a second?
-Sure.

73
00:07:18.354 --> 00:07:21.440
I want you to take a look at this
for that big strip-club exposé.

74
00:07:21.524 --> 00:07:23.442
But I'd rather stick with the crop circle story.

75
00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.861
Come on.
You know those things are just a hoax.

76
00:07:25.945 --> 00:07:28.864
No, I'm telling you,
I sense something about that cornfield.

77
00:07:28.948 --> 00:07:33.994
Call it women's intuition or ESPN or both,
but I can tell when danger's near. I just...

78
00:07:36.914 --> 00:07:39.624
-My eyes!
-Cindy, it's sweeps month.

79
00:07:39.709 --> 00:07:41.126
Ratings mean everything.

80
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:45.464
People want human-interest stories,
like the one you did yesterday.

81
00:07:45.548 --> 00:07:47.299
The report on breast augmentation?

82
00:07:47.717 --> 00:07:49.718
It was just ten minutes of topless women.

83
00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:51.720
I mean, come on.

84
00:07:52.638 --> 00:07:55.307
-Wow!
-Why are these so interesting?

85
00:07:55.391 --> 00:07:56.683
For God's sake!

86
00:07:57.685 --> 00:07:58.894
People don't care about this.

87
00:07:59.103 --> 00:08:02.689
They want hard-hitting stories
and in-depth coverage and... And...

88
00:08:02.899 --> 00:08:03.982
And twins!

89
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:27.839
You think it was the Kreisel boys
who cut that stuff into your corn?

90
00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:30.342
All I know is my crops are gone.

91
00:08:30.426 --> 00:08:33.720
The bank's gonna foreclose
if I can't pay the rent.

92
00:08:33.804 --> 00:08:37.349
I got 60 days to come up with $1.50.

93
00:08:38.434 --> 00:08:41.811
I'm sorry.
The last thing you needed was more...

94
00:08:42.772 --> 00:08:44.314
...hardship in your life.

95
00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:46.816
Especially after what happened to your...

96
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:49.319
Sheriff, I don't need your sympathy.

97
00:08:49.403 --> 00:08:51.821
I didn't mean to upset you, Father.

98
00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.908
Please. I'm not a minister anymore.

99
00:08:54.992 --> 00:08:57.619
I lost my faith that terrible night.

100
00:08:58.996 --> 00:09:03.250
Your faith will return,
just as sure as the sun will rise.

101
00:09:03.334 --> 00:09:04.668
Sounds like a long shot.

102
00:09:04.752 --> 00:09:09.256
Look, there's always an explanation
for all this so-called phenomenon.

103
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:10.423
Maybe you're right.

104
00:09:10.633 --> 00:09:12.634
It was probably just the Kreisels.

105
00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.761
And when I get through with them,

106
00:09:14.845 --> 00:09:18.431
I doubt you'll be seeing anything strange
on this farm for a long time.

107
00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.433
You'll see.

108
00:09:22.186 --> 00:09:24.980
You all right, Tom? Get some rest.

109
00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:38.034
George!

110
00:09:40.162 --> 00:09:43.081
I need you back here tomorrow night
after you pick up Sue.

111
00:09:43.165 --> 00:09:44.416
That tractor needs fixing.

112
00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.502
Sorry, dawg. I can't help you.
I have to get ready for my show.

113
00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:50.714
Not that stupid hip-hop stuff again.

114
00:09:50.798 --> 00:09:53.133
Damn it, George, when are you gonna
do something with your life?

115
00:09:53.217 --> 00:09:54.593
-I got a dream!
-What is your dream?

116
00:09:54.677 --> 00:09:55.760
To have a dream.

117
00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:00.140
George, all you've done
is chase adolescent fantasies.

118
00:10:00.224 --> 00:10:04.102
"I wanna be an astronaut, a cowboy,
gynecologist to the stars."

119
00:10:04.186 --> 00:10:05.937
And now, this stupid hip-hop thing.

120
00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:09.566
For your information,
this hip-hop thing is gonna get me paid.

121
00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.276
I'm gonna win that rap battle
tomorrow night.

122
00:10:11.527 --> 00:10:13.528
Rap battle? For God's sakes.

123
00:10:13.696 --> 00:10:15.614
You just hate me 'cause I'm black.

124
00:10:16.741 --> 00:10:18.408
You don't have any faith in me.

125
00:10:18.492 --> 00:10:20.327
You don't have any faith
in anything anymore.

126
00:10:20.411 --> 00:10:24.164
So why don't you just worry about you,
and I'll worry about...

127
00:10:42.224 --> 00:10:43.350
Cody.

128
00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:46.853
You're late again, Aunt Cindy.

129
00:10:46.937 --> 00:10:49.064
I'm sorry. I was stuck in traffic.

130
00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:52.734
-Cindy!
-Brenda, hi!

131
00:10:52.818 --> 00:10:54.569
It's great to see you!

132
00:10:55.571 --> 00:10:58.156
-It's been so long.
-Too long.

133
00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.616
I've been working so hard.

134
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.826
You know, I've had to spend
more and more time at the station.

135
00:11:01.911 --> 00:11:04.913
The news just keeps coming in.

136
00:11:04.997 --> 00:11:06.581
What was the assignment?

137
00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:08.416
Draw your family and friends.

138
00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.419
So, anyone new in your life, Cindy?

139
00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:15.006
Well, you know,
I just haven't found the right guy.

140
00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.759
I'm looking for something more
than just good sex.

141
00:11:17.843 --> 00:11:19.427
I know, you want commitment.

142
00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.930
No, I want great sex.
And when I meet that guy...

143
00:11:22.014 --> 00:11:24.432
That's what I'm talking about!

144
00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:27.352
You want a guy
that's gonna hit that thing hard, like...

145
00:11:29.397 --> 00:11:31.898
And then flip you over
and come at you from the other side.

146
00:11:32.024 --> 00:11:33.942
D-O-double-G.

147
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.028
Did I say stop drawing?

148
00:11:38.114 --> 00:11:41.616
And then he'll look at you,
like he gonna cut you.

149
00:11:43.285 --> 00:11:46.371
Brenda, you're so romantic.

150
00:11:47.331 --> 00:11:48.331
I guess.

151
00:11:48.749 --> 00:11:51.459
Look, when I meet Mr. Right, I'll know.

152
00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.337
Uncle George!

153
00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:56.673
Hey, sweetie, come here!

154
00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.341
How are you?

155
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.721
Go get your stuff, okay?

156
00:12:02.805 --> 00:12:05.390
I know you. You're Tom Logan's brother.

157
00:12:05.975 --> 00:12:08.351
-And you're that reporter, Cindy Campbell.
-Yeah.

158
00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:10.145
You did the story on our cop cycles.

159
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:12.063
Crop circles.

160
00:12:12.314 --> 00:12:13.481
Right.

161
00:12:14.316 --> 00:12:16.443
So, you're here to pick up your...

162
00:12:16.527 --> 00:12:18.027
Nephew. Cody.

163
00:12:18.654 --> 00:12:19.946
You don't dress like a farmer.

164
00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.573
My brother's the farmer.

165
00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:24.409
I'm the rapper.

166
00:12:24.493 --> 00:12:27.036
For real. And here's the 6-1-1 on that.

167
00:12:27.204 --> 00:12:29.831
That's phone repair. You mean 4-1-1.

168
00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.083
Right.

169
00:12:32.168 --> 00:12:35.044
So, I'll be doing the rap battle
at the 23 Club tomorrow night.

170
00:12:35.838 --> 00:12:37.005
I don't believe this shit.

171
00:12:37.089 --> 00:12:39.215
Word. You two should come down!

172
00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.594
I be rappin', I be cappin',
I be tappin', I be flappin',

173
00:12:42.678 --> 00:12:47.265
I be happening. Ding, bing, wing. Yo!

174
00:12:47.683 --> 00:12:50.226
-Sounds good.
-Would, could, should, 'hood.

175
00:12:51.145 --> 00:12:52.604
Gug, mug, dug, bug.

176
00:12:53.022 --> 00:12:55.648
If we say we'll come,
will you shut your ass up?

177
00:12:56.358 --> 00:13:00.111
Okay, then. Fresh.
I'll see you guys tomorrow night.

178
00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.864
-Okay. Bye.
-Peace out.

179
00:13:08.204 --> 00:13:10.038
Now, who the fuck did that?

180
00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.630
Honey, what is it?
Are you having one of your visions?

181
00:13:18.714 --> 00:13:21.090
There's a girl with black hair.

182
00:13:21.717 --> 00:13:23.343
She wants to kill you.

183
00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:28.890
Your period starts in three, two, one.

184
00:13:28.974 --> 00:13:31.518
What else? Cody, what else do you see?

185
00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:35.146
I see a little boy and a grown woman,
but no father.

186
00:13:35.731 --> 00:13:38.399
-Cody.
-I see you kneeling in dog shit.

187
00:13:38.609 --> 00:13:39.692
What?

188
00:13:40.736 --> 00:13:43.238
Oh, for God's sake.

189
00:13:43.572 --> 00:13:44.989
Cody, don't you understand?

190
00:13:45.074 --> 00:13:48.076
As long as we have each other,
that's all we need.

191
00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:50.912
Cody, I know things have been tough
for you since your mom died.

192
00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:55.333
God, I've been so selfish.
Always putting my career first.

193
00:13:55.417 --> 00:13:58.503
From now on,
I'm gonna be thinking about you 24...

194
00:13:59.129 --> 00:14:00.129
Damn!

195
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.966
Wait, Cindy!

196
00:14:19.775 --> 00:14:22.861
Honey, I'm gonna be leaving soon, so...

197
00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:37.667
Do you know who she is?

198
00:14:38.544 --> 00:14:40.128
No,

199
00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:42.463
but sometimes she talks to me.

200
00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.257
She's coming tonight.

201
00:14:57.855 --> 00:15:00.315
-Father Muldoon!
-Cindy.

202
00:15:00.399 --> 00:15:04.277
I'm so grateful you could come.
I've called all over for babysitters.

203
00:15:04.361 --> 00:15:06.696
I don't mind filling in now and then.

204
00:15:07.823 --> 00:15:09.574
Where is little Cody?

205
00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:14.913
I don't know.
He must be back in his room, playing.

206
00:15:15.164 --> 00:15:17.999
Anyway, make sure
Cody washes everywhere.

207
00:15:18.083 --> 00:15:20.960
Also, he has a little rash on his behind.

208
00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:24.213
Could you rub this lotion
on his little bottom?

209
00:15:24.298 --> 00:15:26.591
Just apply it liberally.

210
00:15:26.675 --> 00:15:28.843
Thank you, Father. Good night.

211
00:15:33.515 --> 00:15:34.766
Cody.

212
00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.988
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's getting thick up in here.

213
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:51.699
Hey, look,
before we get on with the battles tonight,

214
00:15:51.784 --> 00:15:53.534
I got a couple announcements to make.

215
00:15:53.619 --> 00:15:57.038
I know y'all are gonna wanna bust a cap
in the air for your favorite rapper,

216
00:15:57.122 --> 00:16:02.126
but if you could please hold on
to your gunfire until the end of the show.

217
00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.129
Now, look, let's just put the safeties on.

218
00:16:05.381 --> 00:16:08.216
It's on the left side of the gun
above the trigger guard.

219
00:16:10.886 --> 00:16:13.763
Will somebody get his ass out of here?
Get his ass up out of here!

220
00:16:14.056 --> 00:16:17.058
All right. DJ, spin that shit!

221
00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:40.790
-My bad.
-Mother...

222
00:16:44.378 --> 00:16:47.505
Brenda, is something wrong?
You look scared.

223
00:16:47.589 --> 00:16:50.425
I don't know.
All that stuff you was saying on TV,

224
00:16:50.759 --> 00:16:53.511
I just got a weird feeling
something bad is heading my way,

225
00:16:53.595 --> 00:16:56.723
like when you see an Asian person
behind the wheel of a car.

226
00:16:57.224 --> 00:16:58.766
Cindy, after the show,

227
00:16:59.184 --> 00:17:01.936
if I don't end up on all fours
with some anonymous guy,

228
00:17:02.021 --> 00:17:03.312
or drink an ass load of Cristal

229
00:17:03.397 --> 00:17:06.190
and have to sleep it off
in a dumpster behind the Sizzler,

230
00:17:06.275 --> 00:17:09.193
you think maybe you could come back
to my crib and hang out with me?

231
00:17:09.278 --> 00:17:10.528
I don't wanna be alone.

232
00:17:10.946 --> 00:17:12.363
Of course I will, Brenda.

233
00:17:12.448 --> 00:17:14.532
I love you!

234
00:17:14.616 --> 00:17:17.118
Pay my way, okay?

235
00:17:17.369 --> 00:17:20.830
Yo, yo, yo, George! What's up
with the man with the tightest rapping...

236
00:17:20.914 --> 00:17:22.540
-What's up, B? What's good?
-...on the streets, baby!

237
00:17:22.624 --> 00:17:24.042
-What's good with you, boy?
-Dude!

238
00:17:24.126 --> 00:17:26.044
-What's good, baby?
-Dude!

239
00:17:26.128 --> 00:17:29.756
Finally, the white man is gonna school
the black man on how to rap.

240
00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:30.923
-Yeah!
-Yeah, I guess.

241
00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:33.051
-Word.
-How many people are here, you think?

242
00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:34.177
Shit.

243
00:17:34.261 --> 00:17:38.056
I don't know, man.
100, 200 whitey-hating, chrome-packing,

244
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.808
ready to bust a cap in any white boy's ass
who ain't bringing that shit.

245
00:17:40.976 --> 00:17:43.269
-Yeah. At least. Yeah.
-Word.

246
00:17:43.645 --> 00:17:45.605
What's wrong, George?

247
00:17:45.689 --> 00:17:48.066
You ever wonder when it's time
to stop living up here

248
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:50.610
and start living down here?

249
00:17:50.694 --> 00:17:53.571
But what if we stop living over here
and move over there?

250
00:17:53.655 --> 00:17:55.907
Shit, my Aunt ShaNeequa
used to live over there, man,

251
00:17:55.991 --> 00:17:57.492
-but that bitch got evicted, though.
-Word?

252
00:17:57.576 --> 00:17:58.701
-Yeah, I'm dead serious.
-What for?

253
00:17:58.827 --> 00:18:00.953
-Mice.
-Mice? I thought she had rats.

254
00:18:01.038 --> 00:18:02.914
No, man. Rats are outside, mice are inside.

255
00:18:02.998 --> 00:18:05.041
Yo, but what if a mouse goes outside?
Does it become a rat?

256
00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:06.834
And if a rat is in the house, is it a mouse?

257
00:18:07.086 --> 00:18:09.087
I ain't never seen no mouse outside.
That's what I'm saying.

258
00:18:09.171 --> 00:18:10.505
That's because it's a rat, fool!

259
00:18:10.589 --> 00:18:13.841
Damn. Yeah, you might've just made a fact
just now. That's some real shit!

260
00:18:14.176 --> 00:18:16.010
-Fellas, what are you guys talking about?
-That's hot!

261
00:18:16.303 --> 00:18:19.180
Yo, George, you need something?
'Cause I will do anything for you.

262
00:18:20.849 --> 00:18:21.849
Anything.

263
00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:26.896
Well, about those chrome-packing,
whitey-hating gangsters, perhaps...

264
00:18:27.022 --> 00:18:29.148
-What he need is a hype man.
-Word!

265
00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:30.900
Yeah, yeah, a-come on.

266
00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:32.318
You can be his Spliff Star.

267
00:18:32.444 --> 00:18:33.444
That's me, that's what I do.

268
00:18:33.570 --> 00:18:36.739
That's my job, baby. That's what I do!
You know...

269
00:18:39.034 --> 00:18:41.160
That's what I do.
When you a hype man, you take them hits.

270
00:18:41.245 --> 00:18:42.620
Now, let's get out there, man!

271
00:18:43.038 --> 00:18:44.872
Heads or tail, playboy, what's it gonna be?

272
00:18:45.415 --> 00:18:47.208
You cannot escape your fate in the streets

273
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:49.919
Okay, I count cash, you count sheep

274
00:18:50.003 --> 00:18:52.296
You better not sleep on the beats, capisce

275
00:18:53.924 --> 00:18:55.758
All right, all right, all right! That was hot!

276
00:18:55.884 --> 00:18:58.970
That's what I'm talking about.
That was hot, right? Right?

277
00:18:59.054 --> 00:19:00.429
Yo, what do we think?

278
00:19:03.392 --> 00:19:05.560
I thought you were both absolutely dreadful.

279
00:19:06.687 --> 00:19:08.396
-Ghastly.
-What?

280
00:19:08.730 --> 00:19:10.731
I don't know what I'm doing here.

281
00:19:10.816 --> 00:19:13.442
This club is totally pathetic.

282
00:19:22.911 --> 00:19:23.995
Everybody put your hands up.

283
00:19:24.079 --> 00:19:26.998
This is it. You ready, George?
It's show time, baby.

284
00:19:27.082 --> 00:19:28.791
-Okay.
-I just want to let you know, man,

285
00:19:28.917 --> 00:19:32.086
that no matter what goes on
on that stage tonight,

286
00:19:33.130 --> 00:19:34.255
you'll always be in my heart.

287
00:19:34.464 --> 00:19:36.257
That's love. That's love right there.

288
00:19:36.425 --> 00:19:38.843
-I love you.
-That's what I'm talking about.

289
00:19:41.263 --> 00:19:43.347
-I love you, man. Can you feel it?
-That's what I'm talking about.

290
00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:46.517
-Hey, come here, y'all. Come here.
-Can you feel my love on your hip?

291
00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:48.102
-Can you feel it?
-I can't get around!

292
00:19:48.187 --> 00:19:49.353
-Okay.
-Come on, dawg!

293
00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:51.898
-That's what I'm talking about.
-You go out there and you rip it tonight.

294
00:19:51.982 --> 00:19:54.609
All right, man?
Do your thing tonight, all right?

295
00:19:54.693 --> 00:19:56.694
-Okay, cool. All right.
-We shouldn't have to do that.

296
00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:58.696
-We love each other.
-I'm gonna go bring you on.

297
00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.156
Let's do it, baby. We hyped!

298
00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:05.161
Yeah, all right, all right.
Y'all ready for the next throw down?

299
00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:08.372
To my left, we have the reigning champion,

300
00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.583
hailing from Fort Apache, the Bronx.

301
00:20:10.667 --> 00:20:11.876
BS 1-1-1.

302
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:14.712
Some of y'all call him
"Jealous Ones Still Envy."

303
00:20:14.838 --> 00:20:17.548
Some of y'all call him the Don Cartagena!

304
00:20:17.841 --> 00:20:19.800
Some of y'all call him Joey Crack.

305
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:24.805
-Stick 'em up!
-But tonight, let's give it up for Fat Joe!

306
00:20:27.017 --> 00:20:28.226
I gotta go against him?

307
00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:29.977
Give it up! Give it up!

308
00:20:30.145 --> 00:20:32.021
What, you think they're here to see Fat Joe?

309
00:20:32.105 --> 00:20:34.106
-Joe! Joe! Joe!
-Joe! Joe! Joe!

310
00:20:34.191 --> 00:20:36.317
No, man, they're saying, "Go! Go! Go!"

311
00:20:37.819 --> 00:20:38.986
Now our challenger.

312
00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:45.159
He's a farmer rapper, so you know
he been kicking the shit all day!

313
00:20:45.244 --> 00:20:47.411
Let's give it up for my man, George!

314
00:20:47.996 --> 00:20:50.915
That's what I'm talking about! Yeah, yeah!
Come on, everybody!

315
00:20:50.999 --> 00:20:53.292
-That's right.
-Put your hands...

316
00:20:53.377 --> 00:20:55.503
That's right. Okay, Joey Crack.

317
00:20:56.088 --> 00:20:58.881
You the reigning champion,
so you get to spit first.

318
00:20:59.007 --> 00:21:00.716
Yo, DJ, spin that shit!

319
00:21:03.262 --> 00:21:04.887
These guys can't be serious right here.

320
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:08.891
Standing Mini-Me, AKA
"I hope he ain't the one you fight with."

321
00:21:09.226 --> 00:21:12.103
Hey, yo, this nigga's mad corny
And he got no skills

322
00:21:12.187 --> 00:21:14.605
'Cause he's all right
But he's not real

323
00:21:14.773 --> 00:21:17.149
I don't mean to hurt your feelings
But you'll never get a deal

324
00:21:17.234 --> 00:21:19.694
'Cause he's all right
But he's not real

325
00:21:19.778 --> 00:21:22.863
You're a needle in the haystack
I'm the don, the city slicker

326
00:21:22.948 --> 00:21:26.617
Forget cows and milk your mom's
Her titties give ya that elixir

327
00:21:26.702 --> 00:21:27.743
Thought he wasn't?

328
00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:30.204
Bet this nigga end up
Having kids with his cousin

329
00:21:30.747 --> 00:21:33.124
Half-retarded
My number-one fan be like

330
00:21:34.042 --> 00:21:35.751
That means Fat Joe's the man!

331
00:21:36.044 --> 00:21:37.878
You're a liar in denial

332
00:21:38.171 --> 00:21:40.673
Kill your ass quicker than I died in Empire

333
00:21:41.216 --> 00:21:42.883
How dare you want to joust with me?

334
00:21:43.135 --> 00:21:45.678
Looking like you dying of SARS
Or mad cow disease

335
00:21:45.887 --> 00:21:48.055
You fake D-rabbit out to battle me

336
00:21:48.515 --> 00:21:51.392
Eight miles down the road
The farm's that-a-way

337
00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:54.228
Okay. No, no, wait a minute!

338
00:21:57.065 --> 00:22:00.526
All right! All right! That was hot!
That was tight, Fat Joe.

339
00:22:00.610 --> 00:22:05.573
Yo! Now, everybody,
give it up for my man, George!

340
00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:07.700
DJ, spin that shit!

341
00:22:15.083 --> 00:22:16.083
Bitch.

342
00:22:18.086 --> 00:22:20.212
Ho.

343
00:22:30.015 --> 00:22:32.016
Now everybody in the 2-0-2

344
00:22:32.267 --> 00:22:34.769
Throw your hands in the air
'Cause Fat Joe is through

345
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.105
Now everybody in the 2-0-2
Throw 'em up

346
00:22:38.607 --> 00:22:40.441
Check it out

347
00:22:40.692 --> 00:22:43.027
I'm a white boy
But my neck is red

348
00:22:43.111 --> 00:22:45.988
I put Miracle Whip
On my Wonder Bread

349
00:22:46.073 --> 00:22:48.699
My face is pale
I've never been in jail

350
00:22:48.784 --> 00:22:50.785
Me and Buffy spend
Every winter in Vail

351
00:22:50.952 --> 00:22:53.954
How many bitches have I slapped?
Zero

352
00:22:54.039 --> 00:22:56.457
And Martha Stewart happens to be my hero

353
00:22:56.666 --> 00:22:59.168
I grew up on a farm
And I was born with no rhythm

354
00:22:59.461 --> 00:23:02.046
Dr. Phil's my uncle
And I like to hang with him

355
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:04.465
I can't dance
I wear khaki pants

356
00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:07.426
My middle name's Lance
My grandma's from France

357
00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:09.970
So maybe I'm wack
'Cause my skin ain't black

358
00:23:10.138 --> 00:23:12.390
But you can't talk smack
'Cause whitey just struck back

359
00:23:19.314 --> 00:23:20.398
That's what I'm talking about, baby!

360
00:23:20.482 --> 00:23:22.024
-2-0-2, Fat Joe is through!
-2-0-2, Fat Joe is through!

361
00:23:22.109 --> 00:23:24.485
-Give it up for George!
-Yeah!

362
00:23:25.529 --> 00:23:27.405
That's my boy right there! That's what I'm...

363
00:23:27.489 --> 00:23:28.739
Oh, shit.

364
00:23:33.912 --> 00:23:35.704
-George. George. The hood.
-Hell, no!

365
00:23:36.123 --> 00:23:38.833
-Lose the hood.
-I know. We're in the 'hood now.

366
00:23:39.042 --> 00:23:41.335
-No, man.
-He's a dead man.

367
00:23:41.503 --> 00:23:43.963
You guys feeling me? In the 'hood?

368
00:23:51.847 --> 00:23:53.597
That's it. I'm done.

369
00:23:54.015 --> 00:23:56.016
Man, you can't give up rap just like that.

370
00:23:56.184 --> 00:23:57.768
Rap-schmap!

371
00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:59.937
Look, you still got it! See?

372
00:24:01.731 --> 00:24:03.816
Thanks for coming over tonight, Cindy.

373
00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:06.277
I guess I'm just going through a rough time.

374
00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:09.822
Brenda, you want to tell me
what's really bothering you?

375
00:24:12.617 --> 00:24:16.662
Well, there's something I need to...
I saw a tape.

376
00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:19.540
I think you should know about it.

377
00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:22.501
It had these really shocking images, Cindy.

378
00:24:22.586 --> 00:24:24.962
Brenda, it was Mardi Gras.

379
00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.174
I never drank vodka before,
and I was out of beads!

380
00:24:28.467 --> 00:24:30.217
No, not that tape, Cindy.

381
00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:32.553
Well, I guess it's just an urban legend.

382
00:24:33.054 --> 00:24:35.055
You watch it,

383
00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.893
and as soon as it's over,
your phone rings and a creepy voice says,

384
00:24:39.019 --> 00:24:40.895
"You're gonna die in seven days."

385
00:24:42.022 --> 00:24:43.397
And seven days later...

386
00:24:45.108 --> 00:24:46.108
When did you watch it?

387
00:24:46.568 --> 00:24:48.402
A week ago.

388
00:24:48.487 --> 00:24:51.572
-A week ago tonight.
-Brenda...

389
00:24:56.411 --> 00:24:58.078
Oh, my God!

390
00:24:59.289 --> 00:25:00.289
Brenda!

391
00:25:01.625 --> 00:25:04.293
Brenda! Oh, my God!

392
00:25:08.423 --> 00:25:10.549
Oh, my God, you bitch!

393
00:25:10.634 --> 00:25:11.967
Ketchup!

394
00:25:12.093 --> 00:25:14.220
You should have seen the look on your face!

395
00:25:16.431 --> 00:25:17.556
You got me!

396
00:25:20.227 --> 00:25:21.769
Brenda? Brenda?

397
00:25:22.938 --> 00:25:24.605
Oh, my God! Brenda!

398
00:25:27.734 --> 00:25:28.943
Brenda!

399
00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.953
-I can't believe you fell for that fake seizure!
-But it seemed so real!

400
00:25:39.162 --> 00:25:41.288
-It did, didn't it?
-And you peed!

401
00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.832
Yeah! I really sold that shit, didn't I?

402
00:25:45.335 --> 00:25:48.254
I just love the look on your face
when you are scared.

403
00:25:48.338 --> 00:25:50.464
Girl, you are too easy.

404
00:25:57.806 --> 00:26:00.558
I got you with the old fake hand!

405
00:26:03.144 --> 00:26:05.729
-Girl, you were scared!
-Well, I know!

406
00:26:05.939 --> 00:26:09.733
-Come on. I was just kidding.
-Well, you've taken it too far, Brenda.

407
00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:12.861
I'm gonna go get the rest of the popcorn!

408
00:26:19.536 --> 00:26:20.578
Cindy?

409
00:26:20.662 --> 00:26:23.080
Forget it. I am not falling for it again.

410
00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:42.474
Come on.

411
00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:44.268
Cindy, the news is on!

412
00:26:44.853 --> 00:26:47.438
Another little white girl
done fell down a well.

413
00:26:47.731 --> 00:26:50.441
Fifty black people
get their ass beat by police today,

414
00:26:50.525 --> 00:26:53.360
but the whole world gotta stop
for one little whitey down a hole.

415
00:26:59.117 --> 00:27:00.284
Cindy!

416
00:27:02.704 --> 00:27:04.705
The TV's leaking!

417
00:27:06.374 --> 00:27:07.374
Cindy?

418
00:27:08.376 --> 00:27:09.918
Cindy, something's wrong here.

419
00:27:26.102 --> 00:27:28.562
Cindy, this bitch is messing up my floor!

420
00:27:33.485 --> 00:27:34.902
Cindy, help me!

421
00:27:35.236 --> 00:27:36.403
I'm not listening.

422
00:27:39.407 --> 00:27:40.783
Get up, you little ugly bitch.

423
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:42.493
Come on. Let me see what you got.

424
00:27:42.786 --> 00:27:44.870
What you gonna do? That's all?

425
00:27:50.085 --> 00:27:51.543
I'm whupping her ass, Cindy!

426
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:52.961
Yeah! What's up?

427
00:28:07.227 --> 00:28:10.729
Cindy, please help me! Cindy!

428
00:28:11.940 --> 00:28:14.983
Okay, hang on a second. Hello?

429
00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:17.736
Father Muldoon here.
We're getting along famously.

430
00:28:17.946 --> 00:28:19.780
Thanks again, Father. Bye-bye.

431
00:28:20.198 --> 00:28:23.867
Brenda?

432
00:28:26.705 --> 00:28:28.122
Brenda!

433
00:28:41.136 --> 00:28:42.428
Oh, my God!

434
00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:45.806
Yes, yes, of course I'll tell her. Thank you.

435
00:28:47.851 --> 00:28:51.478
Sue's teacher, Brenda. She's dead.

436
00:28:53.481 --> 00:28:56.400
-I'd better tell her.
-No, no, no. I can do it.

437
00:29:02.657 --> 00:29:04.158
-Sue?
-Yes?

438
00:29:05.702 --> 00:29:08.495
-You know your teacher, Miss Brenda?
-Yeah?

439
00:29:08.705 --> 00:29:09.830
She's dead!

440
00:29:10.957 --> 00:29:14.418
Gone forever! Died a horrible, painful death!

441
00:29:14.961 --> 00:29:17.129
Gone, gone, gone, just like your dog!

442
00:29:17.464 --> 00:29:18.464
My dog's dead?

443
00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:22.259
I just ran him over with the car
when I drove in!

444
00:29:22.343 --> 00:29:24.678
Everyone you love around you is dying!

445
00:29:34.355 --> 00:29:36.190
Hello, Father.

446
00:29:36.274 --> 00:29:39.860
Don't call me "Father."
I haven't been a clergyman since...

447
00:29:43.364 --> 00:29:45.491
I'm sorry about that night.

448
00:29:46.409 --> 00:29:50.496
If I hadn't fallen asleep while driving
for that exact 20 minutes,

449
00:29:50.872 --> 00:29:54.124
if I hadn't drank that
exact whole bottle of Jägermeister,

450
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:59.129
if I hadn't raped and mutilated
that exact mulatto hitchhiker...

451
00:29:59.214 --> 00:30:00.881
-Sayaman...
-...if I hadn't been caught in that

452
00:30:00.965 --> 00:30:03.634
exact motel room
with those exact two boys...

453
00:30:03.718 --> 00:30:07.721
Sayaman. I don't see
what any of this has to do with Annie.

454
00:30:08.097 --> 00:30:10.766
I'm sorry. Those were other nights.

455
00:30:10.850 --> 00:30:13.352
But if it had been that night,

456
00:30:13.436 --> 00:30:17.147
I might have missed her. That terrible night.

457
00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.571
Hey!

458
00:30:37.961 --> 00:30:41.421
-It's your wife, Father. She's hurt.
-Annie?

459
00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:44.091
She was hit by a truck
and she's pinned against a tree.

460
00:30:44.759 --> 00:30:45.759
I don't understand.

461
00:30:46.219 --> 00:30:49.721
As long as the truck has her pinned,
she'll stay alive.

462
00:30:50.265 --> 00:30:51.682
I still don't get it.

463
00:30:56.104 --> 00:30:59.273
This is your wife.

464
00:31:01.109 --> 00:31:02.150
She broke her wiener?

465
00:31:05.363 --> 00:31:07.573
Look what happens to the taco.

466
00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:13.620
Look, I don't understand all this
fancy medical lingo. I wanna see Annie.

467
00:31:15.748 --> 00:31:17.833
She's split in half.

468
00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:21.795
You mean, like down-the-middle in half?

469
00:31:22.630 --> 00:31:23.630
At the waist.

470
00:31:24.090 --> 00:31:27.217
You mean this is the last time
I can talk to the top half?

471
00:31:28.469 --> 00:31:32.723
Yes. The truck is the only thing
that is holding her together.

472
00:31:33.474 --> 00:31:36.435
Let's say this is her bottom half.

473
00:31:37.145 --> 00:31:38.812
Can I squeeze in a few minutes with that?

474
00:31:40.148 --> 00:31:42.316
I'm not sure what you mean.

475
00:31:43.318 --> 00:31:45.736
-Let me explain.
-Tom.

476
00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.821
Go to her.

477
00:31:55.496 --> 00:31:58.582
Tom, I'll need a ride home.

478
00:32:01.711 --> 00:32:04.504
Hey, baby. How's it going?

479
00:32:05.965 --> 00:32:07.341
I'm dying, Tom.

480
00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.345
Don't talk like that. The truck barely hit you.

481
00:32:13.681 --> 00:32:16.850
Honey, kiss me one last time.

482
00:32:19.979 --> 00:32:22.314
Promise me you'll never remarry.

483
00:32:23.107 --> 00:32:24.232
I promise.

484
00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.818
And no sex, either.

485
00:32:28.404 --> 00:32:30.405
I'm sorry. I didn't catch that.

486
00:32:31.032 --> 00:32:34.159
-No sex.
-Honey, you're not speaking clearly.

487
00:32:34.243 --> 00:32:36.370
-Your injuries must be awful.
-No sex.

488
00:32:36.454 --> 00:32:38.163
-Cruel fate to shroud my wife's...
-No sex.

489
00:32:38.247 --> 00:32:39.748
-...dying words in mystery.
-No sex.

490
00:32:39.832 --> 00:32:41.792
-No sex!
-Poor Annie.

491
00:32:41.876 --> 00:32:44.920
We hardly knew her.
She'll be missed terribly.

492
00:32:45.004 --> 00:32:47.464
-Jesus.
-That's right, honey, go into the light.

493
00:32:47.548 --> 00:32:48.799
Look!

494
00:32:48.883 --> 00:32:51.343
Just tell George, "Swing away."

495
00:32:51.886 --> 00:32:53.220
Right. Swing away.

496
00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:56.139
Sure. That you understand.

497
00:32:58.142 --> 00:33:00.435
Annie? Annie!

498
00:33:02.605 --> 00:33:04.523
I'm sorry, dude.

499
00:33:04.607 --> 00:33:08.986
Don't call me dude.
I'm not a stoner anymore, not since...

500
00:33:10.905 --> 00:33:12.614
Goodbye, Tom.

501
00:33:28.589 --> 00:33:30.424
I'm so sorry, Mr. and Mrs. Meeks.

502
00:33:31.175 --> 00:33:32.384
Brenda was a good friend

503
00:33:32.844 --> 00:33:34.052
when she was alive.

504
00:33:34.137 --> 00:33:38.223
My sweet, sweet Brenda.
She looks so peaceful.

505
00:33:43.312 --> 00:33:46.523
If only God had taken us
instead of our daughter.

506
00:33:46.941 --> 00:33:50.444
And knowing your Brenda like I did,
I'd say she wishes the same thing.

507
00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:54.281
These just came today.

508
00:33:55.408 --> 00:33:57.659
Photos from a trip she took.

509
00:34:01.456 --> 00:34:03.623
-They're blank.
-Turn them around, honey.

510
00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:07.586
Yes, of course.

511
00:34:08.629 --> 00:34:10.589
-Who's this?
-That's Ralph.

512
00:34:10.965 --> 00:34:12.591
He's right over there.

513
00:34:18.931 --> 00:34:19.931
Cody?

514
00:34:20.016 --> 00:34:22.893
It's a boy. He's going to be an asshole.

515
00:34:23.644 --> 00:34:26.980
Smoke all you want.
You're gonna get hit by a bus.

516
00:34:27.482 --> 00:34:29.941
That's not fooling anyone.

517
00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.653
-Cindy.
-George.

518
00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:37.074
Hey. Sue wanted to pay her respects
to her teacher.

519
00:34:38.159 --> 00:34:40.410
-You?
-Brenda was my bitch.

520
00:34:40.495 --> 00:34:41.536
Of course.

521
00:34:44.832 --> 00:34:46.249
Are you okay?

522
00:34:46.334 --> 00:34:48.335
It's just the open coffin.

523
00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:50.545
I can't believe
they just leave it out here like this.

524
00:34:51.005 --> 00:34:53.173
-George, it's a wake.
-Awake?

525
00:34:53.257 --> 00:34:54.800
-Brenda! It's a miracle!
-No! George, stop!

526
00:34:55.009 --> 00:34:56.176
I thought you were dead!

527
00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.261
Sue, your teacher's alive!

528
00:34:58.346 --> 00:34:59.721
-Hello?
-What did he say?

529
00:34:59.806 --> 00:35:03.100
I got your back, George! I got your back!

530
00:35:04.352 --> 00:35:05.352
I'll tell you what!

531
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:10.941
Mahalik, she's alive! Brenda!

532
00:35:11.025 --> 00:35:14.277
-George, stop! She's dead!
-Brenda! No! We won't lose you again!

533
00:35:14.362 --> 00:35:16.363
Mahalik, help!

534
00:35:16.614 --> 00:35:17.614
Nothing!

535
00:35:21.119 --> 00:35:23.161
-She's not breathing!
-No!

536
00:35:23.287 --> 00:35:25.205
Live, damn it! Live!

537
00:35:25.289 --> 00:35:26.456
Don't!

538
00:35:26.833 --> 00:35:28.500
Live, damn it! Live!

539
00:35:30.086 --> 00:35:31.545
Let me open her windpipe!

540
00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:35.882
-Charles! Charles, stop them!
-Breathe!

541
00:35:39.595 --> 00:35:41.888
Someone stop them! What are they doing?

542
00:35:42.056 --> 00:35:43.431
Get off!

543
00:35:43.724 --> 00:35:45.725
She's alive! She's alive!

544
00:35:46.185 --> 00:35:48.562
Wake up! Brenda, Brenda, breathe!

545
00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:00.740
Clear!

546
00:36:00.825 --> 00:36:02.492
No!

547
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:09.082
I got something! I got something!

548
00:36:16.799 --> 00:36:18.175
-That's it!
-George!

549
00:36:18.259 --> 00:36:21.011
That's the last time I try to bring anyone
back from the dead.

550
00:36:21.095 --> 00:36:25.265
George, don't get down on yourself.
I know you were only trying to help.

551
00:36:25.349 --> 00:36:26.892
You're a good, caring person,

552
00:36:28.436 --> 00:36:29.728
which is why I like you.

553
00:36:31.189 --> 00:36:34.232
Thanks, Cindy,
but I don't wanna screw your life up, too.

554
00:36:34.317 --> 00:36:36.234
The most caring thing I could do
for everyone right now

555
00:36:36.319 --> 00:36:37.736
is to just get out of here.

556
00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:40.155
George! What about Sue?

557
00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:45.827
Yes. Of course. Once I get Sue, then...

558
00:36:45.953 --> 00:36:47.621
Wait!

559
00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:52.751
I could really use a friend right now.

560
00:36:54.795 --> 00:36:58.131
Brenda's gone, Cody resents me.

561
00:36:59.175 --> 00:37:02.385
And I'm caught up in something
I can't even...

562
00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:04.721
Oh, God, it's so hard!

563
00:37:04.805 --> 00:37:08.141
Well, you're beautiful
and you're pressing up against me.

564
00:37:10.645 --> 00:37:12.979
Look, Cindy,

565
00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:17.651
I know you'd never consider
going out with a guy like me,

566
00:37:17.735 --> 00:37:20.695
but if you're not too busy tomorrow night...

567
00:37:22.823 --> 00:37:25.659
-Is that a yes?
-Yes.

568
00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:35.252
Cindy, did Brenda ever talk to you
about a tape?

569
00:37:35.336 --> 00:37:37.003
She did mention something.

570
00:37:37.338 --> 00:37:39.297
Do you mind if I go upstairs
and look around?

571
00:37:39.507 --> 00:37:41.591
Yes, go. Of course. Go.

572
00:37:42.134 --> 00:37:44.970
Cody, I'll be right back, okay?

573
00:37:45.054 --> 00:37:49.516
You're getting laid tonight.
He doesn't know you're a guy.

574
00:38:48.951 --> 00:38:50.577
Oh, shit.

575
00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:32.118
Hello?

576
00:39:33.579 --> 00:39:35.955
What? Willie Mays?

577
00:39:37.541 --> 00:39:39.667
Who's gay? Hello?

578
00:39:39.752 --> 00:39:41.169
...me now?

579
00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:42.379
What?

580
00:39:42.463 --> 00:39:44.881
-Can you hear me now?
-Kind of.

581
00:39:44.965 --> 00:39:46.758
-Can you hear me now?
-Yes, perfect.

582
00:39:46.842 --> 00:39:49.886
-Seven days.
-Seven days?

583
00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.846
Oh, my God. I'm gonna die next Monday?

584
00:39:51.931 --> 00:39:55.475
Yes. No, wait. Monday.
That would be seven business days.

585
00:39:55.559 --> 00:39:59.562
-This is seven days starting now.
-So seven days to this very hour?

586
00:39:59.647 --> 00:40:01.856
My watch broke.
How am I gonna know the exact hour?

587
00:40:01.941 --> 00:40:04.526
Forget hours.
This day, seven days from now.

588
00:40:04.652 --> 00:40:07.153
But there's a holiday coming up.
Do you count the holiday as a day?

589
00:40:07.238 --> 00:40:09.030
Well, that depends. What holiday?

590
00:40:09.115 --> 00:40:11.241
-Martin Luther King Day.
-Then no.

591
00:40:11.325 --> 00:40:13.493
Why not? Everybody at work is taking it off.

592
00:40:13.577 --> 00:40:15.912
Jesus Christ, lady.
I'm giving you seven friggin' days.

593
00:40:15.996 --> 00:40:20.500
I can come over there now and kill
the shit out of you if you'd rather have that.

594
00:40:23.003 --> 00:40:24.879
George, I don't care what you say, man.

595
00:40:24.964 --> 00:40:26.840
I'm signing you up for another rap battle.

596
00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:29.259
Mahalik, I told you.
That part of my life is over.

597
00:40:29.343 --> 00:40:31.719
I said the same thing
about getting with CJ's sister.

598
00:40:31.804 --> 00:40:34.305
-But look at me. I'm still hitting that.
-He's still hitting it, man!

599
00:40:34.390 --> 00:40:36.683
And she fine as shit! That's my sister! What?

600
00:40:36.767 --> 00:40:37.934
It doesn't matter. I'm done.

601
00:40:38.018 --> 00:40:39.811
So, what are you gonna do
with the rest of your life, dawg?

602
00:40:39.895 --> 00:40:41.604
I don't know.

603
00:40:43.023 --> 00:40:45.191
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

604
00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:48.528
Maybe my brother was right.
Maybe I should just settle down.

605
00:40:51.073 --> 00:40:52.115
-What's up, then?
-Mother...

606
00:40:52.199 --> 00:40:53.199
I got another one, y'all.

607
00:40:53.284 --> 00:40:57.537
Well, George, man, you can't focus
on that shit, man. Let that go.

608
00:40:59.373 --> 00:41:02.208
Hey, you gotta try this shit, George.

609
00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:08.298
-Yo, man, you got to take the lid off!
-What's wrong with you, man?

610
00:41:08.382 --> 00:41:10.008
-Yes, of course.
-Sorry!

611
00:41:12.553 --> 00:41:14.512
-Hello?
-George, something terrible has happened.

612
00:41:14.597 --> 00:41:15.805
I really need your help.

613
00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:21.769
-Cindy, are you okay? What's going on?
-George! George, you have to help me.

614
00:41:21.854 --> 00:41:24.147
I just watched this tape,
the same tape that killed Brenda.

615
00:41:24.231 --> 00:41:27.692
And then the phone rang, and this voice
said that I was gonna die in seven days.

616
00:41:27.776 --> 00:41:30.361
Cindy, there's no such thing
as a killer videotape.

617
00:41:30.446 --> 00:41:31.779
Hell, yeah, there is!

618
00:41:31.864 --> 00:41:33.823
In fact, I know somebody
who can definitely help you with that.

619
00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:35.325
-You do? Who?
-Wait up, man.

620
00:41:35.409 --> 00:41:38.411
I heard Jamal from 90th Street,
he watched that tape last week.

621
00:41:38.496 --> 00:41:40.246
-And this morning he woke up dead.
-No!

622
00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.664
How in the hell do you wake up dead?

623
00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:43.208
'Cause you're alive when you go to sleep.

624
00:41:43.292 --> 00:41:44.876
-Wait. Just tell me who can help me.
-So you telling me

625
00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.586
that you can go to bed dead
and wake up alive?

626
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:49.297
You can't go to bed dead!
Man, that shit would be redundant.

627
00:41:49.381 --> 00:41:50.548
-Just tell me who.
-No, it wouldn't.

628
00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:52.800
'Cause you can go to bed and not be dead,

629
00:41:52.885 --> 00:41:54.552
and you can die but not be in a bed.

630
00:41:54.637 --> 00:41:58.473
But you are in a bed, man. That's how
you wake up dead in the first place, fool!

631
00:41:58.557 --> 00:42:00.558
Damn! That's some quantum shit
right there, man!

632
00:42:00.643 --> 00:42:02.644
-That's what I'm talking about.
-You should be teaching classes!

633
00:42:02.728 --> 00:42:05.313
-You steady dropping knowledge!
-Just tell me who can help me!

634
00:42:05.397 --> 00:42:06.814
-Damn!
-My Aunt ShaNeequa.

635
00:42:06.899 --> 00:42:08.775
Her and her man are into all this weird shit.

636
00:42:08.859 --> 00:42:10.985
They saw the tape
before anybody else knew about it.

637
00:42:11.070 --> 00:42:12.278
Matter of fact,
you should go see them tonight.

638
00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:14.531
-Tonight? Yeah.
-Yeah.

639
00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:16.908
But who will take care of Cody?

640
00:42:18.369 --> 00:42:20.203
George, we're gonna have so much fun.

641
00:42:20.287 --> 00:42:22.372
I have some jigsaw puzzles
and board games

642
00:42:22.456 --> 00:42:25.750
and baseball cards in my room,
and this really cool model airplane.

643
00:42:25.834 --> 00:42:27.210
-I'm gonna go get it.
-Sure.

644
00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:28.711
Okay, so I made him a snack,

645
00:42:28.796 --> 00:42:30.672
and you can give him some warm milk
if he can't go to sleep...

646
00:42:30.756 --> 00:42:31.756
Don't worry.

647
00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.508
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-Here it is.

648
00:42:33.592 --> 00:42:35.802
I'm great with kids. Heads up, Cody.

649
00:42:37.888 --> 00:42:39.639
And in case of emergencies,

650
00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.474
-I left some numbers...
-I'm okay.

651
00:42:42.226 --> 00:42:45.853
Sorry. You okay, kiddo? That a boy!

652
00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:51.734
And I guess that's it.

653
00:42:51.819 --> 00:42:54.237
-Okay, I'm off.
-Right.

654
00:42:54.822 --> 00:42:59.742
You know, it's funny.
All a child ever really wants is a family.

655
00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:01.077
Yo.

656
00:43:02.037 --> 00:43:04.581
-Cody really likes you.
-He's a good kid.

657
00:43:04.665 --> 00:43:06.124
Yeah.

658
00:43:08.711 --> 00:43:10.587
-Bye.
-Bye.

659
00:43:26.395 --> 00:43:29.314
-Hello?
-I know.

660
00:43:29.398 --> 00:43:32.191
You're Cindy. Be right with you.

661
00:43:32.693 --> 00:43:33.901
Aunt ShaNeequa?

662
00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:40.033
Bingo. But you can call me the Oracle.
And don't worry about that vase.

663
00:43:40.326 --> 00:43:42.910
What vase? Sorry, I didn't know.

664
00:43:45.706 --> 00:43:46.831
That vase.

665
00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:49.959
Please, sit.

666
00:43:55.591 --> 00:43:56.758
It was the chair.

667
00:44:04.224 --> 00:44:05.558
Yes, the chair.

668
00:44:06.977 --> 00:44:11.439
I know why you've come.
A great mystery lies ahead of you,

669
00:44:11.523 --> 00:44:13.733
but you must not shy away
from the challenge.

670
00:44:14.485 --> 00:44:16.611
Only you can be the one who will...

671
00:44:18.447 --> 00:44:19.697
-Orpheus?
-What, baby?

672
00:44:19.782 --> 00:44:20.823
Sweetie?

673
00:44:22.117 --> 00:44:24.035
I'm watching the game.

674
00:44:25.454 --> 00:44:26.704
Do you mind?

675
00:44:29.124 --> 00:44:30.500
The Lakers will win by 12.

676
00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:35.588
-So can you tell me about...
-The tape?

677
00:44:36.131 --> 00:44:39.050
-Yes. I watched it, and...
-The phone rang.

678
00:44:40.052 --> 00:44:43.596
-Right. And then this voice said...
-That you would die in seven days.

679
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:46.099
-Okay, that's getting...
-Extremely annoying.

680
00:44:46.183 --> 00:44:48.851
-Yeah.
-Try being married to her.

681
00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:51.813
I catch shit about women
I ain't slept with yet.

682
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:55.608
You made a copy of the tape. Let's see it.

683
00:44:56.026 --> 00:44:57.610
Yes, okay.

684
00:45:04.076 --> 00:45:05.326
ShaNeequa, can you tell me if...

685
00:45:05.411 --> 00:45:08.871
The tape is connected
to the crop circles and the aliens? Yes.

686
00:45:09.415 --> 00:45:12.750
But it's up to you
to discover how for yourself.

687
00:45:13.669 --> 00:45:15.962
-Look, it's a...
-Cigarette?

688
00:45:16.755 --> 00:45:18.673
I was going to say "lighthouse."

689
00:45:20.134 --> 00:45:22.427
Find that lighthouse. It's your destiny.

690
00:45:25.389 --> 00:45:27.724
Wait. What is that?

691
00:45:32.563 --> 00:45:34.689
Oh, my God.

692
00:45:53.500 --> 00:45:54.959
There we go.

693
00:45:57.045 --> 00:45:58.838
Now, baby...

694
00:45:59.631 --> 00:46:01.632
I knew that was gonna happen.

695
00:46:02.801 --> 00:46:04.302
Come on.

696
00:46:05.888 --> 00:46:08.681
Hell, no. Get your ass out the TV!

697
00:46:08.766 --> 00:46:12.310
What's wrong with you?
I'm gonna teach you not to be...

698
00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:14.520
-Get out that TV!
-Baby, no! No!

699
00:46:14.605 --> 00:46:16.439
-No! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go!
-Yeah!

700
00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:18.524
Come on, we gonna get another lawsuit.
Come on!

701
00:46:18.609 --> 00:46:20.234
She spit on me. I'll kill the bitch.

702
00:46:21.361 --> 00:46:24.405
You won. You won. You won. You won.

703
00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:25.823
-Upstairs. Upstairs.
-Okay. Okay.

704
00:46:25.908 --> 00:46:27.033
-Down low.
-Okay.

705
00:46:27.117 --> 00:46:28.618
-All right.
-Baby, no!

706
00:46:28.702 --> 00:46:31.829
-Kill her! Is you crazy? Is you crazy?
-Baby!

707
00:46:32.998 --> 00:46:34.248
-What you gonna brush now?
-Cool down.

708
00:46:34.333 --> 00:46:35.875
What you gonna brush now, huh?

709
00:46:37.544 --> 00:46:39.170
You picked the wrong TV to come out of.

710
00:46:44.718 --> 00:46:46.928
George? Cody?

711
00:46:50.224 --> 00:46:51.599
George?

712
00:46:52.768 --> 00:46:55.812
-What happened?
-I don't know.

713
00:46:55.896 --> 00:46:59.440
Cody and I were playing a fun game,
and then I looked down and...

714
00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:01.943
Yahtzee!

715
00:47:08.408 --> 00:47:09.450
No!

716
00:47:11.411 --> 00:47:13.204
Oh, my God!

717
00:47:13.622 --> 00:47:15.706
-How could you let him watch the tape?
-I didn't...

718
00:47:24.633 --> 00:47:27.176
-Hello?
-It's me.

719
00:47:27.261 --> 00:47:29.303
-How you doing?
-Fine.

720
00:47:29.805 --> 00:47:32.515
Enjoying your last week?
I can't wait to see you.

721
00:47:32.599 --> 00:47:35.434
-Six days now, right?
-Yeah.

722
00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:38.062
Well, it was great catching up,
but can I speak to Cody?

723
00:47:38.146 --> 00:47:40.439
Why? He didn't watch the tape.

724
00:47:40.524 --> 00:47:43.401
Yes, he did.
Come on, Cindy, I do this for a living.

725
00:47:43.485 --> 00:47:44.569
Leave us alone!

726
00:47:50.492 --> 00:47:51.826
-Hello?
-Hello,

727
00:47:51.910 --> 00:47:55.955
I'm calling from Reader's Digest
with a fantastic offer for Cody.

728
00:47:56.623 --> 00:47:59.542
No, you're not!
You're that evil little girl from the tape!

729
00:48:00.168 --> 00:48:03.379
Okay, you got me.
How about I just leave a message for him?

730
00:48:03.463 --> 00:48:05.131
Fine.

731
00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:10.636
Yeah. Okay, how do you spell that?

732
00:48:11.597 --> 00:48:15.141
Right. Okay, got it. Bye-bye.

733
00:48:21.815 --> 00:48:24.734
-I can't believe you let that happen.
-I know. I'm sorry, I screwed up...

734
00:48:24.818 --> 00:48:26.819
Listen, we can still save him.

735
00:48:26.904 --> 00:48:30.656
The answer to the tape,
to your crop circles, is at a lighthouse.

736
00:48:30.741 --> 00:48:33.451
-You think I'm crazy, don't you?
-Of course I do,

737
00:48:33.744 --> 00:48:36.871
but the last thing you need now
is a screw-up like me.

738
00:48:36.955 --> 00:48:39.665
-I'm gonna leave for good.
-Wait.

739
00:48:41.668 --> 00:48:44.754
Well, what should I tell Cody?

740
00:48:45.589 --> 00:48:48.466
Let him down easy.
Tell him I got called away on business.

741
00:48:48.550 --> 00:48:50.509
You'll think of something.

742
00:48:50.594 --> 00:48:52.929
Testicular cancer. He won't ask questions.

743
00:48:53.013 --> 00:48:56.182
-I knew you'd understand.
-George!

744
00:48:56.266 --> 00:49:02.271
Just be careful. Something weird
is going on at your farm. I know it.

745
00:49:02.356 --> 00:49:03.648
I don't know what you're talking about.

746
00:49:03.732 --> 00:49:05.900
Sometimes a sheep just needs
to be pushed through the fence.

747
00:49:05.984 --> 00:49:08.277
-What?
-Goodbye, Cindy.

748
00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.303
Sue?

749
00:49:34.388 --> 00:49:35.554
I can't sleep.

750
00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:39.558
Well, it's way past your bedtime.

751
00:49:41.561 --> 00:49:45.690
Won't you rock me to sleep
in your big, strong arms?

752
00:49:47.484 --> 00:49:49.402
There's plenty of room under the covers.

753
00:49:50.195 --> 00:49:52.071
It's a hot night.

754
00:49:52.572 --> 00:49:54.573
You don't need to wear pajamas.

755
00:49:56.493 --> 00:49:57.576
Where is my daughter?

756
00:49:57.869 --> 00:50:00.121
Are you mad? I am your daughter.

757
00:50:00.205 --> 00:50:01.872
No, you're not!

758
00:50:04.084 --> 00:50:05.835
Come here!

759
00:50:05.919 --> 00:50:08.587
-What did you do with Sue?
-I didn't touch her. I swear.

760
00:50:08.714 --> 00:50:12.341
-I don't believe you!
-Please! For God's sakes, she's a girl!

761
00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:13.551
You sick...

762
00:50:34.698 --> 00:50:36.198
Daddy!

763
00:50:36.283 --> 00:50:39.618
How do you like it, huh? Having fun?

764
00:50:56.928 --> 00:50:59.388
Tom, are you...

765
00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:02.558
What in the world?

766
00:51:05.145 --> 00:51:06.979
Look.

767
00:51:07.105 --> 00:51:08.689
What is that thing?

768
00:51:09.149 --> 00:51:10.816
I don't know.

769
00:51:11.401 --> 00:51:13.944
Maybe Cindy was right.

770
00:51:29.503 --> 00:51:31.754
Please, sir. All I need is five minutes.

771
00:51:31.838 --> 00:51:34.924
And I told you, Campbell,
no more paranoid on-air rants

772
00:51:35.008 --> 00:51:36.509
about the supernatural.

773
00:51:36.635 --> 00:51:40.179
I know. This station is about sex,
violence and the weather.

774
00:51:40.263 --> 00:51:41.931
Yes. That reminds me.

775
00:51:42.015 --> 00:51:44.934
We're gonna need that "Porn Star
Shot Dead in a Hurricane" story.

776
00:51:45.018 --> 00:51:46.560
One hour.

777
00:51:46.645 --> 00:51:48.938
Meanwhile, a tornado in Charleston

778
00:51:49.022 --> 00:51:51.607
threatens a clothing-optional beach
where, just yesterday,

779
00:51:51.691 --> 00:51:53.943
a naked couple was brutally murdered.

780
00:51:54.027 --> 00:51:55.778
-This just five miles from the spot...
-I'm sorry.

781
00:51:55.862 --> 00:51:58.280
...where the last naked couple
was brutally murdered.

782
00:51:58.365 --> 00:52:00.533
Turning now to sports.

783
00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:05.454
And an evil videotape that kills anyone
who watches it in seven days.

784
00:52:05.539 --> 00:52:07.957
It's true. We're all in danger.

785
00:52:08.041 --> 00:52:09.625
-There's an alien force out there...
-Oh, no.

786
00:52:09.709 --> 00:52:12.044
...that's trying to prevent you
from knowing the truth.

787
00:52:12.129 --> 00:52:14.421
-Campbell, are you insane?
-Trust me, it's a horrible fate.

788
00:52:14.506 --> 00:52:15.631
-Carson, I have to do this.
-Do you hear me?

789
00:52:15.715 --> 00:52:17.800
Correction, there really is no danger.

790
00:52:17.884 --> 00:52:20.553
Actually, I didn't really mean
anything I just said.

791
00:52:21.054 --> 00:52:23.472
Yes, I did. Every word of it.

792
00:52:23.557 --> 00:52:25.724
Everyone watching this
could be dead in a week.

793
00:52:32.232 --> 00:52:33.566
1-3-4-19...

794
00:52:36.236 --> 00:52:37.278
4-6-9...

795
00:52:37.362 --> 00:52:41.323
I been cleaning after this
dumb-ass cracker, Giggins, for 10 years.

796
00:52:41.408 --> 00:52:43.993
But I been waxing his bitch's ass for 12.

797
00:52:44.077 --> 00:52:45.578
Know what I'm saying, nigger?

798
00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:48.497
I ride that ho like your mama rides the bus.

799
00:52:48.582 --> 00:52:50.332
She likes her some chocolate.

800
00:52:50.417 --> 00:52:52.626
Sharpton for President, y'all. I'm outty.

801
00:52:53.587 --> 00:52:54.753
Peace.

802
00:52:55.714 --> 00:52:58.507
An evil videotape
that kills people in seven days?

803
00:52:58.592 --> 00:53:00.634
Alien forces threatening the world?

804
00:53:00.719 --> 00:53:02.469
And who in the hell is this Cindy Campbell?

805
00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:05.264
If what she says is true,
we're facing an unprecedented crisis.

806
00:53:05.348 --> 00:53:07.683
-Get me the President.
-You are the President.

807
00:53:07.767 --> 00:53:11.353
Good. Then I already know about this.
Let's order lunch.

808
00:53:11.438 --> 00:53:13.981
Sir, I think you need to go on TV

809
00:53:14.065 --> 00:53:17.693
and convince the people
that there is no such thing as a UFO.

810
00:53:17.777 --> 00:53:19.612
Don't spell in front of me, damn it.

811
00:53:20.447 --> 00:53:23.365
Aliens, sir. There's no such thing as aliens.

812
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:25.201
-That's not quite true.
-Sir?

813
00:53:25.285 --> 00:53:28.329
A year ago, a UFO crash-landed
in New Mexico.

814
00:53:28.622 --> 00:53:31.373
-A body may have been recovered.
-"May have been"?

815
00:53:31.458 --> 00:53:34.293
Well, there was a terrible mix-up.

816
00:53:34.377 --> 00:53:38.714
It was Thanksgiving.
The body was sent down to the kitchen.

817
00:53:38.798 --> 00:53:42.635
They shoved stuffing up its ass,
and we ate it at a state dinner.

818
00:53:42.719 --> 00:53:44.178
That's the last I saw of it.

819
00:53:44.262 --> 00:53:47.848
No, scratch that. There were
some sandwiches made the next day.

820
00:53:47.933 --> 00:53:50.559
-Mr. President! Listen to me carefully.
-Agent Thompson!

821
00:53:50.644 --> 00:53:51.936
Back away from that window!

822
00:53:52.395 --> 00:53:54.813
What? Did I forget
to put my pants on again?

823
00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:58.567
No, sir. It's just a feeling I've been
having since the news about the aliens.

824
00:53:58.652 --> 00:54:00.736
-Something's not right.
-I know what you mean.

825
00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:03.864
Like that feeling
that something's not right.

826
00:54:05.116 --> 00:54:07.243
What is it?

827
00:54:07.327 --> 00:54:09.161
Some old Tupac, sir.

828
00:54:11.498 --> 00:54:15.918
All Eyez on Me. Hey, this shit is banging.

829
00:54:16.002 --> 00:54:18.379
Thank you, sir. I appreciate it.

830
00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:34.038
Hello, Cindy.

831
00:55:37.083 --> 00:55:41.295
I am the Architect.
You have many questions.

832
00:55:43.757 --> 00:55:45.883
I've been watching you for a very long time.

833
00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:49.511
So I see.

834
00:55:49.888 --> 00:55:52.598
But what is the connection between
the crop circles and the videotape?

835
00:55:52.682 --> 00:55:56.143
The answer is simple.
You are the eventuality of an anomaly.

836
00:55:56.227 --> 00:55:58.812
You are inexorably seeking
a sedulant probability.

837
00:55:58.897 --> 00:56:01.690
-"Sedulant"?
-Grotesquery? No?

838
00:56:01.775 --> 00:56:04.985
What about "contingent affirmation"?
That's got to mean something.

839
00:56:05.070 --> 00:56:09.782
Hey! Hey! You put cameras in my bathroom?

840
00:56:11.284 --> 00:56:13.619
I can't... What is this?

841
00:56:13.703 --> 00:56:16.997
Oh, my God. Well, it was a long winter. I...

842
00:56:17.082 --> 00:56:19.750
-This is an invasion of...
-Sorry.

843
00:56:19.834 --> 00:56:22.669
I can't help it. It's very lonely in here.

844
00:56:22.754 --> 00:56:25.839
Ergo, I haven't been with anyone
in a very long time,

845
00:56:25.924 --> 00:56:29.510
not counting myself, or this chair.

846
00:56:30.220 --> 00:56:33.639
I call her... Linda.

847
00:56:34.099 --> 00:56:36.225
Could you just cut to the chase?
I'm kind of in a rush.

848
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:38.560
Why? You can always
sleep over if you want.

849
00:56:38.645 --> 00:56:40.729
Linda's built for two, and she vibrates.

850
00:56:40.814 --> 00:56:44.149
Stop it! Just tell me what I need to know!
Who is that little girl?

851
00:56:44.234 --> 00:56:45.651
Okay, okay!

852
00:56:48.154 --> 00:56:51.532
My wife and I wanted a child,
but she couldn't get pregnant.

853
00:56:51.616 --> 00:56:54.576
-Neither could I.
-So you adopted?

854
00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:57.162
We loved our daughter, but she was evil.

855
00:56:57.288 --> 00:57:01.875
Made the horses crazy, killed our puppies,
hid the remote, really sick shit.

856
00:57:02.168 --> 00:57:05.003
My wife took her to the old family farm
and drowned her in the well.

857
00:57:06.005 --> 00:57:08.590
I felt a simple time-out
would've been sufficient.

858
00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:12.261
But Tabitha imprinted her evil
on a videotape.

859
00:57:13.012 --> 00:57:16.098
-I never meant for it to get out, but...
-But what?

860
00:57:16.683 --> 00:57:19.268
I put it in the wrong box
and returned it to Blockbuster,

861
00:57:19.352 --> 00:57:21.437
instead of my copy of Pootie Tang.

862
00:57:21.521 --> 00:57:24.273
And it's been circulating
and killing ever since.

863
00:57:24.357 --> 00:57:26.150
Just like Pootie Tang.

864
00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.112
-But what does this have to do with aliens?
-I don't know.

865
00:57:30.196 --> 00:57:33.073
Perhaps Tabitha's summoning them
to kill us all.

866
00:57:33.158 --> 00:57:36.952
An alien invasion? I have to warn the world.

867
00:57:37.036 --> 00:57:39.496
It's already begun. You're too late.

868
00:57:40.206 --> 00:57:41.748
Oh, my God.

869
00:57:42.083 --> 00:57:44.334
But not too late to make an old man happy.

870
00:57:46.045 --> 00:57:48.088
What? What?

871
00:57:48.173 --> 00:57:50.966
And now, reports of lights in the sky.

872
00:57:51.050 --> 00:57:53.385
Glimpses of spacecraft.

873
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:57.431
Possible alien sightings
being reported all over the world.

874
00:57:57.515 --> 00:57:58.932
Are they aliens?

875
00:57:59.017 --> 00:58:01.477
The first video images are coming in.

876
00:58:01.561 --> 00:58:05.105
Disturbing home video tonight
from a ranch outside Sydney, Australia.

877
00:58:05.732 --> 00:58:08.150
Watch very carefully now.

878
00:58:08.234 --> 00:58:10.569
There. There it is. Let's see that again.

879
00:58:12.197 --> 00:58:13.780
Very, very disturbing.

880
00:58:14.324 --> 00:58:16.575
And this just in from São Paulo, Brazil.

881
00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:20.913
Let's see that again.

882
00:58:26.586 --> 00:58:29.254
Very, very disturbing.

883
00:58:30.048 --> 00:58:32.716
And this just in from south Texas.

884
00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:40.265
Do they pose a threat?
Only one thing's for certain.

885
00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:43.310
We are all going to be killed.

886
00:58:43.394 --> 00:58:44.978
We have to board up the house.

887
00:58:45.939 --> 00:58:47.523
Are you sure this is necessary, Wilson?

888
00:58:47.607 --> 00:58:49.775
Having an awards ceremony
at a time like this?

889
00:58:49.859 --> 00:58:52.986
Yes, sir.
Everything must appear business as usual.

890
00:58:53.071 --> 00:58:55.864
The nation, while not yet panicked,
is deeply disturbed.

891
00:58:55.949 --> 00:58:57.533
Right. Good, let's see
if we can steer that course,

892
00:58:57.617 --> 00:59:00.953
keeping everybody deeply disturbed.
We don't want a panic.

893
00:59:01.037 --> 00:59:03.539
Very few presidents
have faced a crisis like this.

894
00:59:03.623 --> 00:59:06.542
I wonder what President Ford
would've done.

895
00:59:06.626 --> 00:59:10.379
Well, if the buck stops here,
the buck stops here.

896
00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:15.509
Thank you, all,
and welcome to the White House.

897
00:59:15.593 --> 00:59:19.555
The Mother Teresa Awards recognize those

898
00:59:19.639 --> 00:59:22.641
who have overcome the severest
handicaps and disadvantages

899
00:59:22.725 --> 00:59:24.977
to help others in their communities.

900
00:59:25.061 --> 00:59:28.230
The young, the old, black and white.

901
00:59:28.314 --> 00:59:31.191
Our Native-American friends.
Hey, how are you?

902
00:59:31.276 --> 00:59:34.987
Hey, how are you? Hey, how are you?
Hey, how are you?

903
00:59:36.155 --> 00:59:38.490
Well, it is therefore my honor

904
00:59:38.575 --> 00:59:43.287
to present each and every one
of you with this symbol of merit.

905
00:59:48.626 --> 00:59:50.752
The room is secure, Mr. President.

906
00:59:50.837 --> 00:59:52.671
-Or is it?
-Sir?

907
00:59:52.755 --> 00:59:54.214
I've been thinking, Thompson.

908
00:59:54.674 --> 00:59:56.758
What if the aliens could
take over human bodies?

909
00:59:56.843 --> 00:59:59.553
They'd look just like us, or almost.

910
00:59:59.637 --> 01:00:01.263
I never thought of that, sir.

911
01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:03.307
We should be on alert
for anything suspicious.

912
01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:07.311
-They could be anywhere, even...
-Right here.

913
01:00:07.812 --> 01:00:10.439
My God. We'd never see the attack coming.

914
01:00:10.523 --> 01:00:13.066
-It's frightening, sir!
-Don't panic.

915
01:00:13.943 --> 01:00:17.446
We'll just move slowly toward the exit.

916
01:00:18.615 --> 01:00:21.283
At last we meet, Mr. President.

917
01:00:21.367 --> 01:00:24.578
It's happening. I knew it!
You'll never take me alive!

918
01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.748
She's scrambling my brain!

919
01:00:27.832 --> 01:00:29.124
I'll get her!

920
01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:34.921
No, you don't! Not on my watch!

921
01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.798
Good work, sir!

922
01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:40.761
Good God! The small ones have metal teeth!

923
01:00:40.845 --> 01:00:43.305
Jerry's Kids, my ass!

924
01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:48.894
Mr. President! Mr. President,
have you gone completely insane?

925
01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.479
Like a fox.

926
01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:53.982
We gotta talk to the one person
who saw this coming, Cindy Campbell.

927
01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:57.861
She knows how to defeat the aliens,
these filthy, rotten scum!

928
01:00:58.571 --> 01:01:01.114
You hideous creature! Get off my planet!

929
01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:02.449
No!

930
01:01:02.533 --> 01:01:05.118
-Mr. President, is everything all right?
-The exits are all blocked.

931
01:01:05.203 --> 01:01:06.662
I'll find one, sir.

932
01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.872
Everybody, clear!

933
01:01:11.042 --> 01:01:14.002
This way, sir! God, this is exciting!

934
01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:16.838
You're excited? You should feel my nipples.

935
01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.758
Cody? Cody?

936
01:01:20.593 --> 01:01:23.178
Cody, where are you? Honey?

937
01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:25.514
After today's incident in the East Room,

938
01:01:25.598 --> 01:01:28.100
the White House is now advising all citizens

939
01:01:28.184 --> 01:01:31.937
to board up their homes
and prepare for an alien invasion.

940
01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:33.897
Oh, no.

941
01:01:33.981 --> 01:01:36.525
And now, a News 8 exclusive,

942
01:01:36.609 --> 01:01:38.860
the killer videotape
you've been hearing about.

943
01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:40.487
-No...
-We're the only station that has it,

944
01:01:40.571 --> 01:01:44.241
and we're showing it all night. Very exciting.
Let's roll it again.

945
01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.372
There. Nobody's getting through
that sucker.

946
01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:54.000
That's great, George,
but we have to get down to the cellar.

947
01:01:55.044 --> 01:01:56.878
-George.
-Cindy.

948
01:01:56.963 --> 01:01:58.672
There's no time. Get down to the cellar.

949
01:01:58.756 --> 01:02:00.132
-Cody! Thank God!
-Aunt Cindy!

950
01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:03.427
-I've been worried sick about you.
-He just showed up about an hour ago.

951
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:05.512
-I tried to call.
-No, he didn't.

952
01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.599
-Okay, but I was gonna.
-No, he wasn't.

953
01:02:10.435 --> 01:02:13.019
Look, Cody, the point is
you can't just run away like that.

954
01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.564
I wanted to be with George.

955
01:02:15.648 --> 01:02:18.567
Honey, I know you want a dad, but...

956
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:22.988
Trust me, Cody, I'm not good at anything.
Why would I be good at that?

957
01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:24.573
Uncle George!

958
01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:39.629
It's gonna be okay, Cody.

959
01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:41.840
I'm going to die, aren't I?

960
01:02:42.925 --> 01:02:47.053
Cody, did I ever tell you what your mom
said about you the day you were born?

961
01:02:47.805 --> 01:02:48.847
No.

962
01:02:49.098 --> 01:02:53.143
I was in the delivery room with her.
She was having a hard time.

963
01:02:53.227 --> 01:02:54.811
Then you began to come out of her.

964
01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.231
And your mom screamed
and screamed in pain.

965
01:02:58.316 --> 01:03:01.735
She yelled, "Just kill me.
Bludgeon me with a bedpan.

966
01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:04.613
"Whatever you do, put me out of this pain."

967
01:03:04.697 --> 01:03:06.907
She was gushing torrents of blood.

968
01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:08.867
I have this all on tape
if you wanna see it someday.

969
01:03:09.702 --> 01:03:11.369
Well, finally you came out.

970
01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.580
Your mom cut your umbilical cord herself.

971
01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.583
Well, on the second try.

972
01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:19.336
The first time,
she snipped your penis in half.

973
01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:23.423
After all, she was drunk. Actually, drugged.

974
01:03:23.508 --> 01:03:26.134
We'd been out the night before,
celebrating Saint Patrick's Day,

975
01:03:26.219 --> 01:03:28.637
and she thought,
"Hey, I never tasted crystal meth."

976
01:03:28.721 --> 01:03:29.846
So she did just a little.

977
01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:32.808
-My penis?
-Yes.

978
01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.476
They sewed it on upside-down.

979
01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:38.814
-So that's why I pee up?
-Yes. We'll get it fixed, honey.

980
01:03:38.898 --> 01:03:41.733
It's on my list of things.
Right after we get TiVo.

981
01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.610
Anyway, there you were.

982
01:03:43.694 --> 01:03:48.490
And your mom turned to me, and she said
"Hey, you want him? Take him."

983
01:03:48.574 --> 01:03:52.661
Then she died. And I took you.
Do you know why?

984
01:03:53.913 --> 01:03:57.457
I had just lost my cat in a fire,
and I needed something to pet and feed.

985
01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.918
And I miss that cat, Cody.

986
01:04:00.586 --> 01:04:04.339
But I love you,
and nothing's ever gonna change that,

987
01:04:04.423 --> 01:04:07.008
not even the very painful death
we're about to experience.

988
01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:08.593
George! George.

989
01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:19.521
-Are they gone?
-I don't hear anything.

990
01:04:27.238 --> 01:04:30.198
-Don't worry, Sue. It'll be all right.
-It was Uncle George.

991
01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:32.367
Well, it's scary.

992
01:04:33.786 --> 01:04:36.204
Good work, Sue.

993
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:39.916
I don't know what stupid, idiotic thing
made these lights go off.

994
01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:42.961
All right, there's some spare fuses
in the crawlspace.

995
01:04:43.045 --> 01:04:44.629
If I can get to them,
I can get these lights back on.

996
01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:48.550
Quick, George, grab that railroad tie.

997
01:04:48.634 --> 01:04:50.260
Jam it against the door.

998
01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.306
My balls!

999
01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:58.226
Not those! Jesus!

1000
01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:00.061
No!

1001
01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.981
Uncle George! I'm scared!

1002
01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:05.108
Sweetie, come here. It's okay.

1003
01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.905
There's something
on the other side of the door.

1004
01:05:24.128 --> 01:05:25.337
I can't see anything.

1005
01:05:41.854 --> 01:05:43.021
Oh, my God.

1006
01:05:43.105 --> 01:05:44.439
Can you see them? What are they doing?

1007
01:05:44.523 --> 01:05:48.443
They're horrible.
They're grayish with big black eyes.

1008
01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:50.278
Their teeth are grotesque.

1009
01:05:52.531 --> 01:05:54.658
-I think they're giggling.
-What?

1010
01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.160
Oh, no.

1011
01:05:58.496 --> 01:05:59.537
Oh, no, I think...

1012
01:06:01.457 --> 01:06:03.041
I think they wanna eat me.

1013
01:06:07.046 --> 01:06:09.631
-Help!
-Cody! Oh, my God!

1014
01:06:09.715 --> 01:06:12.133
George. Swing away, George.

1015
01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.929
-I'm coming, Cody. I'll save you.
-Aunt Cindy, help!

1016
01:06:16.013 --> 01:06:17.055
Die!

1017
01:06:20.726 --> 01:06:23.311
Die! You damn aliens, let him go!

1018
01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:25.230
You're not getting in here!

1019
01:06:25.314 --> 01:06:27.065
-What else you got? Bring it!
-George...

1020
01:06:27.566 --> 01:06:29.067
There! Had enough?

1021
01:06:30.236 --> 01:06:31.903
Forget it, Cody. Thank me later.

1022
01:06:31.988 --> 01:06:34.990
Cody. Thank God. Come on.

1023
01:06:35.074 --> 01:06:37.242
-Daddy! Daddy!
-Sue!

1024
01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:43.832
Mahalik, what are you doing here?

1025
01:06:43.916 --> 01:06:45.792
Hey, man, I told you the 'hood's
always got your back.

1026
01:06:45.876 --> 01:06:48.003
Thank God. There's two of them at the door.

1027
01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:50.088
-What?
-They're gone.

1028
01:06:51.507 --> 01:06:54.926
Good. They couldn't get in.
I hear they can't open doors.

1029
01:06:55.219 --> 01:06:58.680
They mastered space flight, but they
can't get through a wooden door?

1030
01:06:58.764 --> 01:07:00.932
Look, the cellar's the safest place.

1031
01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.684
I say all the women and children stay here.

1032
01:07:03.602 --> 01:07:06.187
All right, and the men,
we go outside and fight.

1033
01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:08.773
Right. And what's
the cut-off age for children?

1034
01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.608
Come on, come on.

1035
01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.584
Follow me.

1036
01:07:41.057 --> 01:07:43.016
I'm sorry. I thought I was hitting the brake.

1037
01:07:43.976 --> 01:07:46.144
Now, we don't have to go
through insurance, do we?

1038
01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.189
Mr. President, what are you doing here?

1039
01:07:49.273 --> 01:07:50.565
I'm looking for Cindy Campbell.

1040
01:07:50.649 --> 01:07:52.567
She may hold the key
to defeating the aliens.

1041
01:07:53.402 --> 01:07:56.654
Good. The Air Force is here
with those new round planes.

1042
01:07:58.616 --> 01:08:00.825
We don't have round planes, sir.

1043
01:08:01.410 --> 01:08:04.496
Oh, my God.

1044
01:08:04.622 --> 01:08:06.581
Wait. Do you hear that?

1045
01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.552
-Yo, what's up, George?
-CJ!

1046
01:08:19.637 --> 01:08:21.596
I told you, the 'hood always got your back.

1047
01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:24.933
And I got the boys with me.
Get out the car, man.

1048
01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:27.435
-Yo, who we gonna shoot?
-Y'all ready to go step?

1049
01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:29.854
Well, let's go do this,
'cause I'm hyped right now, B!

1050
01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.107
-I'm real hyped!
-You stepped on my shoe, bitch!

1051
01:08:32.191 --> 01:08:35.110
Call me another bitch again,
and I'll park your truck dead in your ass.

1052
01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.153
-Calm down, man.
-Damn, homey!

1053
01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.571
-In the cornfield.
-They're coming!

1054
01:08:38.656 --> 01:08:39.697
Hey, look, don't even worry about that.

1055
01:08:39.782 --> 01:08:41.616
Me and my boys here, we gonna
go ahead and take care of this.

1056
01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:42.784
Hey, yo, come on, let's start it!

1057
01:08:42.868 --> 01:08:45.370
If I was you, son, I'd bust this shit right now.

1058
01:08:45.454 --> 01:08:47.205
-Your mama!
-I got your number, too, homey.

1059
01:08:47.289 --> 01:08:48.289
Hey! We over here, y'all!

1060
01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.792
He ain't gonna bust nothing.
I got nuts bigger than him, ya heard?

1061
01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:53.753
Percival, you country-ass,
maple-syrup nigger.

1062
01:08:53.838 --> 01:08:56.506
Y'all want some biscuits?
You want some biscuits?

1063
01:08:58.676 --> 01:09:00.176
Get down! Get down!

1064
01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:10.645
I can't believe what I just saw.

1065
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:14.899
These men died for their country.
Send flowers to their bitches and hos.

1066
01:09:20.197 --> 01:09:22.240
I can't break free!

1067
01:09:22.366 --> 01:09:25.410
Think! They must have
some kind of weakness.

1068
01:09:30.583 --> 01:09:31.833
I found it!

1069
01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:35.837
-Without their heads, they're powerless!
-Please, no. We mean you no harm.

1070
01:09:36.088 --> 01:09:38.840
We traveled to your planet
to find an evil little girl.

1071
01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:42.302
We must destroy her before seven days.

1072
01:09:42.386 --> 01:09:44.721
You mean you watched the videotape?

1073
01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:47.307
Our satellite picked up
what we thought was Pootie Tang.

1074
01:09:47.391 --> 01:09:49.017
That was a week ago.

1075
01:09:49.101 --> 01:09:53.980
And now our entire race will die
unless the girl is destroyed.

1076
01:09:55.482 --> 01:09:58.193
-See? They are peaceful.
-Well, if they're so peaceful, man,

1077
01:09:58.277 --> 01:10:00.445
why were they choking us
a few minutes ago?

1078
01:10:00.529 --> 01:10:02.488
That's how we say hello.

1079
01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:04.991
Hello! Nice to see you.

1080
01:10:05.075 --> 01:10:06.618
-Hello, hello.
-Hello, hello.

1081
01:10:06.702 --> 01:10:08.703
Well, how do you guys say goodbye?

1082
01:10:11.207 --> 01:10:12.540
I had to ask.

1083
01:10:12.625 --> 01:10:16.294
If you think that's strange,
you should see how we pee.

1084
01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.638
So we're not so different after all.

1085
01:10:29.683 --> 01:10:34.062
There's something about this place.
It's like I've seen it before.

1086
01:10:36.273 --> 01:10:37.315
Oh, my God.

1087
01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:45.490
This used to be their farm.
She died right here.

1088
01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.632
There's something down there.

1089
01:11:26.031 --> 01:11:27.949
-Push back. Follow through.
-Hey.

1090
01:11:28.033 --> 01:11:30.368
-Follow through.
-Yeah. You got it.

1091
01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:34.622
Just look at this.
Human beings and aliens working together.

1092
01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:37.667
We're all just one big galactic family.

1093
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:42.297
Family. That's just what
I've been running away from.

1094
01:11:42.381 --> 01:11:45.216
Well, that's because you're an idiot.

1095
01:11:55.519 --> 01:11:57.812
This is it.

1096
01:11:57.896 --> 01:12:01.149
My wife took her to the old family farm
and drowned her in the well.

1097
01:12:05.362 --> 01:12:09.240
The little girl. She's frightened of the well.

1098
01:12:29.803 --> 01:12:31.137
Cindy!

1099
01:13:08.967 --> 01:13:11.427
Time to go back down the well, bitch.

1100
01:13:14.056 --> 01:13:16.933
-Cindy!
-No. Don't hurt him!

1101
01:13:18.602 --> 01:13:21.145
Cindy, you have to come outside.
The aliens aren't invading...

1102
01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:25.108
Don't worry, Cody. I'll save you.

1103
01:13:25.859 --> 01:13:28.986
Wait! Wait. Don't do this.

1104
01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.280
You don't have to be evil.

1105
01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:35.326
I know what happened to you, Tabitha.

1106
01:13:37.621 --> 01:13:40.164
I know what your mom did. That was wrong.

1107
01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:43.251
You were just a little girl.
And you're still that little girl,

1108
01:13:43.335 --> 01:13:47.922
just a lot more corpsy
and with really bad teeth.

1109
01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:52.677
But maybe all you need is a mother.

1110
01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:57.473
And a father.

1111
01:14:11.029 --> 01:14:13.614
-We could be...
-A family.

1112
01:14:18.871 --> 01:14:20.746
Thank you all.

1113
01:14:20.831 --> 01:14:24.292
Your love has broken the curse
and freed my soul.

1114
01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:27.628
-I'll never have to kill again.
-Really?

1115
01:14:27.921 --> 01:14:31.382
Nah! I'm just screwing with you!

1116
01:14:34.052 --> 01:14:37.388
I just want to tell you both good luck.
We're all counting on you.

1117
01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:48.858
Now it's over.

1118
01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.778
No, no, it's okay. He's our friend.

1119
01:14:52.863 --> 01:14:56.616
Thank you for saving our species.
Now we must return to our home planet.

1120
01:14:56.700 --> 01:14:57.992
Goodbye, then.

1121
01:14:59.077 --> 01:15:00.578
Goodbye.

1122
01:15:19.765 --> 01:15:21.974
Hey, congratulations, George!

1123
01:15:22.059 --> 01:15:24.101
You know the 'hood always got your back.

1124
01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.270
Yeah, yeah! Come on!

1125
01:15:31.401 --> 01:15:32.610
-Bye!
-Thank you.

1126
01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:53.381
George, I'm so happy. Finally we're a family.

1127
01:15:53.465 --> 01:15:55.967
Yeah. You, me, and...

1128
01:15:56.718 --> 01:15:57.760
-Damn!
-Damn!

1129
01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.305
Cindy! George! Wait!
