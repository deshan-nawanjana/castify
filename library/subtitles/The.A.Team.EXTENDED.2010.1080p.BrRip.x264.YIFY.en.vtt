00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:50.980
SOMEWHERE IN MEXICO

2
00:00:54.422 ---> 00:01:00.843
Only a stubborn idiot would come here
alone, in a rescue mission.

3
00:01:00.843 --> 00:01:03.622
White did this one to speak.

4
00:01:03.622 --> 00:01:05.539
Then kill him.

5
00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:07.256
Come on, we expect General.

6
00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:13.001
Do not use your gun.

7
00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:15.367
Shoot him with his gun.

8
00:01:16.567 --> 00:01:17.662
Give it here.

9
00:01:26.097 --> 00:01:28.064
It stuck.

10
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:38.284
This has striker gun.

11
00:01:38.892 --> 00:01:40.587
Leave it.

12
00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:46.254
Dogs have never eaten anyone
for some time.

13
00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.619
Next time, buddy ...

14
00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.494
Make a plan.

15
00:01:57.114 --> 00:01:59.466
How bad are Catholic!

16
00:01:59.466 --> 00:02:01.536
You are just sick.

17
00:02:02.774 --> 00:02:04.433
Do not forget the money General.

18
00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:07.861
That white bribed wrong.

19
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.288
And he took with him a gun
without striker.

20
00:02:12.832 --> 00:02:14.363
Hammering

21
00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:29.445

Colonel Hannibal Smith

00:03:14.831 --> 00:03:17.220
Elsewhere In Mexico

25
00:03:52.862 --> 00:03:54.407
BOSCO B.A. BARACUS

26
00:03:54.407 --> 00:03:55.907
Where is my love, fool?

27
00:03:55.907 --> 00:03:58.704
It's alright, it's there.
So that's it?

28
00:03:58.704 --> 00:04:00.877
Will you retire?

29
00:04:00.877 --> 00:04:01.868
Yes.

30
00:04:01.868 --> 00:04:04.124
That's the problem, Bosco.
Or continue doing this,

31
00:04:04.124 --> 00:04:07.918
or do 15 years in jail
Cheeto's cousin in Mexico.

32
00:04:07.918 --> 00:04:10.851
Me feel equal.
You choose how you want it.

33
00:04:10.851 --> 00:04:12.900
Exactly. Easy or the hard way.

34
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.336
Poor

35
00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:35.953
Come on.

36
00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:43.008
Cheats soldier.

37
00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:46.247
Watch B.A.,
one to lose all your friends.

38
00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:49.189
BAD

39
00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.107
What are you doing, baby?

40
00:04:54.107 --> 00:04:57.010
Did you miss me?
Me miss you.

41
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.197
E. It's been so long.

42
00:04:59.197 --> 00:05:00.947
Far too long.

43
00:05:06.513 --> 00:05:08.040
- Move it!
- No!

44
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.752
Nice place. S stock?
I would like to invest here.

45
00:05:13.752 --> 00:05:18.055
I like this setting.
It is very Arizona.

46
00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:20.531
Very Texan. Good.

47
00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:24.188
Can I convince agent
to look.

48
00:05:24.418 --> 00:05:26.887
LIEUTENANT FACEMAN PECK

49
00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:31.097
I like flames
to see on Mars!

50
00:05:31.097 --> 00:05:32.354
Sorry.

51
00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:33.405
Baby ...

52
00:05:33.405 --> 00:05:36.338
Americanule. Military intelligence.

53
00:05:36.338 --> 00:05:37.213
Who?

54
00:05:37.213 --> 00:05:38.845
- You, man.
- No.

55
00:05:38.845 --> 00:05:41.154
I realize that
because you are caught in the tires.

56
00:05:41.154 --> 00:05:44.086
I'm happy.
Could not be better.

57
00:05:44.337 --> 00:05:46.955
Living my dream.

58
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:53.679
You come here to rob me
and I pass the border,

59
00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:56.844
but instead,
you slept with my wife.

60
00:05:56.844 --> 00:05:59.218
First, it is very good.

61
00:05:59.218 --> 00:06:01.614
Both hate you,
so that all together ...

62
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:03.553
Good morning.

63
00:06:03.553 --> 00:06:06.996
- Are you crazy! No!
- Now start the party!

64
00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.056
That's all you can?

65
00:06:54.615 --> 00:06:56.354
Damn!

66
00:06:56.354 --> 00:06:58.788
Move to right, slowly.

67
00:06:59.017 --> 00:07:00.907
Steal my car?

68
00:07:00.907 --> 00:07:02.566
We are on Candid Camera?

69
00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:06.447
I'm not a thief. But if you fail
my friend in time, dies.

70
00:07:06.447 --> 00:07:10.284
If you are a thief,
or are not criminal.

71
00:07:10.284 --> 00:07:15.078
Take your left hand on the wheel,
and right of the exchanger. Now.

72
00:07:15.078 --> 00:07:17.428
I would shoot me in the head, Dad.

73
00:07:17.428 --> 00:07:19.643
You know I did it do that.

74
00:07:21.672 --> 00:07:23.667
What the hell is wrong with you?

75
00:07:23.667 --> 00:07:26.684
Shoot a stranger?
Nor you, fool.

76
00:07:26.684 --> 00:07:27.568
Damn!

77
00:07:27.568 --> 00:07:29.715
I promise you heal.
Bandajeaza up with it.

78
00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.371
I know and I do a patch, you fool.

79
00:07:31.371 --> 00:07:33.133
I know it hurts,
but had to make myself understood.

80
00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:36.098
I do not hate pain.
I hate that you hit the car.

81
00:07:36.098 --> 00:07:37.603
What about you?

82
00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:43.357
Are you armed?

83
00:07:43.822 --> 00:07:46.346
Watch what you say, Dad.

84
00:07:46.346 --> 00:07:50.601
Be prepared to Golesti charger
if you talk bad my battalion.

85
00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:00.865
Colonel Hannibal Smith.

86
00:08:00.865 --> 00:08:02.633
Regiment 75.

87
00:08:02.633 --> 00:08:05.434
Battalion 4.
This is in Georgia.

88
00:08:05.434 --> 00:08:07.540
I know who you are, sir.

89
00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.024
Corporal B.A. Baracus.

90
00:08:09.024 --> 00:08:12.718
Former corporal. I was disband
because of crap.

91
00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:16.755
What a coincidence, corporal.

92
00:08:16.755 --> 00:08:21.469
Would appear as random things
all are part of a plan.

93
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:26.365
I let him eat dogs.

94
00:08:27.407 --> 00:08:31.360
Even in the middle of the desert
when I most needed,

95
00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.540
find a brother in arms.

96
00:08:36.627 --> 00:08:39.637
We need your help
to save another one.

97
00:08:40.462 --> 00:08:41.976
It's too late.

98
00:08:41.976 --> 00:08:46.560
Saving you expect ...
They eat dogs an hour ago.

99
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:51.085
You think you got me?
You think to kill me?

100
00:08:51.085 --> 00:08:54.734
- Can you drive?
- Better than any other, sir.

101
00:08:56.964 --> 00:08:59.293
Nobody knew where we are.

102
00:08:59.293 --> 00:09:02.644
I had no information.
That date, asshole.

103
00:09:03.015 --> 00:09:05.887
In two minutes,
I'll drink a cold beer,

104
00:09:05.887 --> 00:09:08.224
and you will be in flames.

105
00:09:08.224 --> 00:09:09.489
Take care, buddy.

106
00:09:09.984 --> 00:09:15.071
You gave a fuck.

107
00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:19.844
Think about it.

108
00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:26.767
Adios, motherfucker.

109
00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:42.054
Hannibal!

110
00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:45.579
Wait! What are you doing?

111
00:09:51.676 --> 00:09:52.632
Climb!

112
00:09:53.999 --> 00:09:55.545
B.A. Punch it.

113
00:10:07.823 --> 00:10:10.764
This is bullshit!

114
00:10:11.058 --> 00:10:14.413
Kill them!

115
00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:17.273
Stop!

116
00:10:17.273 --> 00:10:20.378
Please stop!

117
00:10:24.693 --> 00:10:27.014
How are you on?

118
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:30.150
That's not gonna be too nice.

119
00:10:37.030 --> 00:10:39.282
Honey.

120
00:10:40.094 --> 00:10:41.414
Baby ...

121
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:43.710
Give me some gum.

122
00:10:43.710 --> 00:10:46.438
Did you see his face Tuco?

123
00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.635
When he appeared ...
It was incredible!

124
00:10:48.635 --> 00:10:50.151
- How many times did I say?
- It was perfect!

125
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:52.050
- How many times did I say?
- It was wonderful!

126
00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:53.282
Whenever I told you, do?

127
00:10:53.282 --> 00:10:55.315
I had to knock on Tuco.

128
00:10:56.016 --> 00:10:57.869
You know what? Sorry.

129
00:10:57.869 --> 00:11:01.602
I am sorry that I did
Hannibal guide me.

130
00:11:01.602 --> 00:11:04.387
- Must take action.
- Your action was pathetic.

131
00:11:04.387 --> 00:11:06.165
Was to die.

132
00:11:06.165 --> 00:11:09.395
Was to kill me and me.
Was to kill him too.

133
00:11:15.626 --> 00:11:17.632
Thank you. Peck.

134
00:11:17.632 --> 00:11:19.868
Baracus. Charmed.

135
00:11:19.868 --> 00:11:21.694
Tried to rescue her.

136
00:11:21.694 --> 00:11:24.121
- Save her?
- Yes.

137
00:11:24.121 --> 00:11:25.373
How?

138
00:11:25.373 --> 00:11:28.147
Please share us
your plan and nine, Is.

139
00:11:29.718 --> 00:11:31.636
I never thought about it yet.

140
00:11:31.636 --> 00:11:33.602
Exactly. I had to think about.

141
00:11:40.942 --> 00:11:42.986
It killed the bastard!

142
00:11:42.986 --> 00:11:43.837
Come down here!

143
00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:57.988
- Hello.
- Chief.

144
00:11:57.988 --> 00:12:00.565
- I still walk the earth?
- Fortunately.

145
00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:02.781
- What you got for me?
- I prepared an early bird.

146
00:12:02.781 --> 00:12:05.430
- A medical helicopter.
- Medical Helicopter?

147
00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:06.916
This is yours.

148
00:12:06.916 --> 00:12:09.566
And the pilot, if you want to call
so, it is somewhere inside.

149
00:12:09.566 --> 00:12:11.729
- Take care of yourself, boss.
- Owe.

150
00:12:11.729 --> 00:12:13.529
I hope you make it up soon.

151
00:12:13.529 --> 00:12:17.580
Three years. Do not leave my girlfriend here.
I fought to have a take back.

152
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:19.116
Leave the keys and go back after it.

153
00:12:31.625 --> 00:12:33.461
Treat your wounds, Corporal.

154
00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:35.763
Hurry.
I'm going to look for the pilot.

155
00:12:40.915 --> 00:12:42.130
Hello.

156
00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:50.010
Doc. Got a minute
for a soldier wounded?

157
00:12:51.055 --> 00:12:52.533
CAPTAIN H.M. Murdock

158
00:12:52.533 --> 00:12:54.129
Decorated fighter pilot.

159
00:12:54.129 --> 00:12:56.298
In his opinion,
is the best in the world.

160
00:12:56.298 --> 00:12:58.323
It's completely crazy.

161
00:12:58.323 --> 00:13:01.284
Last week he tried to flee
resuscit�nd an ambulance.

162
00:13:01.284 --> 00:13:02.142
Free.

163
00:13:02.872 --> 00:13:03.933
Damn!

164
00:13:04.355 --> 00:13:05.666
My kind of man.

165
00:13:07.978 --> 00:13:11.408
- Was to ruin your tattoo.
- He saw Mr anybody. Murdock?

166
00:13:11.408 --> 00:13:14.069
- Old military tattoo.
- Mr. Murdock?

167
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:17.487
You'd think I was crazy
if I say that I have one?

168
00:13:17.487 --> 00:13:19.394
Eyes from injury.

169
00:13:19.394 --> 00:13:22.478
- Mr. Murdock?
- While not working, nurse.

170
00:13:22.478 --> 00:13:24.187
- Not now.
- Why you are not in psychiatry?

171
00:13:24.187 --> 00:13:27.506
Is it gas? It's from you?
Well, I smell gasoline.

172
00:13:27.506 --> 00:13:29.545
- What, in psychiatry?
- Is our patient.

173
00:13:29.545 --> 00:13:31.609
It's from him? I listened.
It's crazy.

174
00:13:31.609 --> 00:13:33.052
I treat or ...

175
00:13:33.052 --> 00:13:35.585
I graduate in medicine.
Johns Hopkins University.

176
00:13:35.585 --> 00:13:38.170
- I've told you sew a flash?
- There is no flash.

177
00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.881
What's with this fool?
S crazy?

178
00:13:40.881 --> 00:13:42.206
- You were!
- You caught fire.

179
00:13:42.206 --> 00:13:43.549
What?

180
00:13:43.549 --> 00:13:45.495
- You were!
- God!

181
00:13:45.495 --> 00:13:47.155
Take that from me.
Are you crazy?

182
00:13:57.245 --> 00:13:58.394
Stop.

183
00:13:58.394 --> 00:14:00.025
Are you a doctor?
Who's the doctor here?

184
00:14:00.025 --> 00:14:01.646
You are in a hospital.

185
00:14:01.646 --> 00:14:03.540
Everybody knew him
Mr. Murdock.

186
00:14:03.540 --> 00:14:06.281
If I knew?
He burned his hand.

187
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:08.404
Well, I sewed a flash.

188
00:14:08.404 --> 00:14:10.352
Look at me, son.

189
00:14:11.098 --> 00:14:13.460
I was told that you are a pilot
very skilled.

190
00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:15.922
- The best, sir.
- I do not get on a helicopter with this madness.

191
00:14:15.922 --> 00:14:18.104
Exactly. It's one
in your experiments?

192
00:14:18.104 --> 00:14:21.194
I am a true soldier.
I am a Ranger.

193
00:14:21.194 --> 00:14:22.862
I am concerned.

194
00:14:23.527 --> 00:14:25.425
I am a Ranger, sir.

195
00:14:25.425 --> 00:14:29.487
To reach me.
Are transferred to our care, Captain.

196
00:14:29.865 --> 00:14:32.958
- Thank you.
- Let 's get the hell out of here.

197
00:14:39.735 --> 00:14:41.239
Move!

198
00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.214
My beautiful!
Did you miss your daddy?

199
00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:50.317
Do, which is the most important
Working in a plane?

200
00:14:50.357 --> 00:14:53.750
Be one step ahead of the enemy
not to run it.

201
00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.787
Who says we run?

202
00:14:54.817 --> 00:14:57.203
Want to go with this madness?

203
00:14:57.313 --> 00:14:59.937
You spin me baby,
you spin me ...

204
00:15:01.395 --> 00:15:02.743
Propellers are right, sir.

205
00:15:02.772 --> 00:15:03.900
Who is this guy?

206
00:15:09.797 --> 00:15:12.232
Come on! Let's go!

207
00:15:12.272 --> 00:15:14.597
Murdock, lift helicopter in the air.

208
00:15:14.627 --> 00:15:17.581
Wait a minute, boss. I'll try something
I saw in a movie.

209
00:15:17.621 --> 00:15:19.696
What are you trying?
Get us the fuck out!

210
00:15:19.736 --> 00:15:21.852
We have a helicopter in the back.

211
00:15:22.401 --> 00:15:26.851
I have warned you guys.
We are bulletproof!

212
00:15:27.719 --> 00:15:29.437
Beware.

213
00:15:38.409 --> 00:15:39.737
You see, white boy.

214
00:15:39.776 --> 00:15:42.401
You destroy the van.
Kill you, fool!

215
00:15:42.431 --> 00:15:44.576
I was allowed to park there
s disability.

216
00:15:44.606 --> 00:15:46.941
- I knew you were crazy.
- This is a mistake.

217
00:15:55.005 --> 00:15:56.412
Fire!

218
00:16:03.009 --> 00:16:04.107
Throw them in the air.

219
00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:10.634
I've never done something like this
until now.

220
00:16:11.931 --> 00:16:12.959
Have you seen this?

221
00:16:12.999 --> 00:16:15.004
You saw the helicopter returned?

222
00:16:19.125 --> 00:16:21.520
You have a lot of training
air combat, eh?

223
00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.638
Do not look at me!
Look ahead!

224
00:16:24.065 --> 00:16:26.290
No longer than eight missiles.

225
00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:30.541
- Captain, get us out of here.
- Hold it. We must rise.

226
00:16:30.571 --> 00:16:31.949
Come on, baby.

227
00:16:40.362 --> 00:16:41.230
Launching missiles!

228
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.136
Misia!

229
00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:44.843
Come on!

230
00:16:44.873 --> 00:16:48.076
To tell you about
cautatoarele heat, guys.

231
00:16:48.106 --> 00:16:50.960
Go to a. ..

232
00:16:55.161 --> 00:16:56.647
Do, draw it inside.

233
00:16:56.977 --> 00:16:59.052
Damn!

234
00:16:59.182 --> 00:17:00.050
Grab on!

235
00:17:01.587 --> 00:17:02.525
Run!

236
00:17:07.535 --> 00:17:11.198
Close the door. I know that you've trained
in aviation, but this was ridiculous.

237
00:17:12.885 --> 00:17:13.992
You okay?

238
00:17:16.487 --> 00:17:19.341
Chief, the idea is to kill
by Tuco, not vice versa.

239
00:17:19.371 --> 00:17:22.015
Be one step ahead of the game
s plan.

240
00:17:24.051 --> 00:17:25.518
Being with two or three steps ...

241
00:17:25.558 --> 00:17:27.973
To know the movement of enemy
before you do ...

242
00:17:28.012 --> 00:17:29.370
This is a plan.

243
00:17:30.357 --> 00:17:32.972
Send details.

244
00:17:33.221 --> 00:17:38.751
General Tuco, you engaged in an attack
unauthorized on U.S. soldiers.

245
00:17:39.838 --> 00:17:41.606
No! You did attack me!

246
00:17:41.646 --> 00:17:46.735
Again, you have engaged in an attack
unauthorized on U.S. soldiers.

247
00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.413
American airspace.

248
00:17:52.443 --> 00:17:53.152
What?

249
00:17:53.182 --> 00:17:56.505
You gave a fuck.

250
00:17:58.241 --> 00:18:02.473
In other words, Adios son of a ...

251
00:18:07.362 --> 00:18:08.740
Yes!

252
00:18:09.748 --> 00:18:11.904
Bravo, captain.

253
00:18:11.924 --> 00:18:12.892
It was great!

254
00:18:12.932 --> 00:18:15.298
- That was not cool!
- You are a genius!

255
00:18:15.327 --> 00:18:16.535
Land that damn thing!

256
00:18:16.555 --> 00:18:18.561
Should not doubt you.

257
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.806
Is there a plan at all.

258
00:18:20.846 --> 00:18:24.508
And I like when a plane
go by the book.

259
00:18:38.947 --> 00:18:41.782
AFTER 8 YEARS
AND 80 OF MISSION SUCCESS

260
00:18:43.329 --> 00:18:44.596
BASE OF OPERATIONS "HeadHunter"

261
00:18:44.616 --> 00:18:46.174
Last days of withdrawal
U.S. troops in Iraq.

262
00:18:50.714 --> 00:18:52.560
Nothing like
Cooper's music.

263
00:18:56.472 --> 00:18:58.268
Napalm or gunpowder?

264
00:18:58.298 --> 00:19:00.842
Gunpowder!

265
00:19:05.542 --> 00:19:06.191
Murdock.

266
00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:07.768
You've burned all parties.

267
00:19:08.097 --> 00:19:11.931
- It's cursed.
- Give all the fire, buddy.

268
00:19:15.792 --> 00:19:17.140
- Want and secret sauce?
- Do not ...

269
00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:19.795
No, no secret sauce.

270
00:19:19.835 --> 00:19:22.290
Secret sauce? Are you crazy?
Everybody knows what e.

271
00:19:22.319 --> 00:19:25.163
Marinate Nobody can
a piece of meat as you do,

272
00:19:25.383 --> 00:19:28.397
but my face paralyzed
last time I ate the sauce.

273
00:19:28.457 --> 00:19:30.443
It was only a partial paralysis.
Come on. Trust me.

274
00:19:30.523 --> 00:19:33.068
Yes, sir.
A to dwell on it.

275
00:19:33.097 --> 00:19:34.844
I have things under control, sir.

276
00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:36.929
I do not think it's good to go
mission half paralyzed.

277
00:19:38.466 --> 00:19:40.102
Visitors.

278
00:19:46.869 --> 00:19:47.697
Yes ...

279
00:19:52.428 --> 00:19:54.384
I'ma little surprised
not gonna lie to you.

280
00:19:55.292 --> 00:19:56.240
Lieutenant.

281
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:58.276
Excuse me, I should tell you
and you too lieutenant?

282
00:19:58.316 --> 00:20:00.461
- No, you should call me captain.
- Captain ...

283
00:20:00.681 --> 00:20:02.926
- Captain?
- Exactly.

284
00:20:02.966 --> 00:20:05.400
Captain Crunch.
Look at you.

285
00:20:06.358 --> 00:20:09.192
I think you abandoned children
the family ...

286
00:20:09.212 --> 00:20:11.887
Without scales that can not advance.

287
00:20:11.917 --> 00:20:14.092
No honey, I gave
at you.

288
00:20:16.957 --> 00:20:20.609
My name is Percy.
Want to eat a pork roast?

289
00:20:20.639 --> 00:20:23.455
If you break every bone hand
you can do that?

290
00:20:23.495 --> 00:20:24.283
It is a nonsense.

291
00:20:24.323 --> 00:20:28.843
We've seen three years,
and want to talk about it?

292
00:20:33.374 --> 00:20:35.220
You what you want to talk?

293
00:20:37.385 --> 00:20:39.241
You've got my Seal's album?

294
00:20:39.271 --> 00:20:41.347
I never plan
Your answer to that.

295
00:20:41.377 --> 00:20:45.897
I heard nine times in a row.
We drank wine and bad guy, remember?

296
00:20:47.334 --> 00:20:49.191
Wait, if nothing.
Do what?

297
00:20:49.231 --> 00:20:50.588
You remember what?

298
00:20:50.628 --> 00:20:53.182
I was in the bedroom ...
Do not you remember?

299
00:20:53.222 --> 00:20:55.379
I remember everything
is that you left.

300
00:20:55.419 --> 00:20:59.879
That's the only memory
that I have with you.

301
00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:05.737
You are the best.

302
00:21:05.767 --> 00:21:07.912
Beware of trouble.

303
00:21:07.952 --> 00:21:09.868
Goodbye. Take care.

304
00:21:09.898 --> 00:21:11.594
Thank you.

305
00:21:13.201 --> 00:21:14.948
To hold the helmet on your head.

306
00:21:23.591 --> 00:21:23.950
Colonel.

307
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.875
My name is Lynch.
Are from the CIA.

308
00:21:26.915 --> 00:21:30.188
Lynch knew someone at the CIA
the time of operation "Desert Storm".

309
00:21:30.227 --> 00:21:32.424
I come from a long line
by Lynch.

310
00:21:32.454 --> 00:21:35.956
Have you ever thought why
that nobody trusts the CIA

311
00:21:35.966 --> 00:21:38.351
is that nobody knows you
real name?

312
00:21:39.948 --> 00:21:41.275
How can I help you,
Mr Lynch?

313
00:21:41.305 --> 00:21:44.139
I want to help me stop them
the former Saddam people

314
00:21:44.159 --> 00:21:47.102
stealing one billion dollars
within 30 hours.

315
00:21:47.751 --> 00:21:50.595
The only media capable
U.S. dollars to replicate

316
00:21:50.615 --> 00:21:53.809
was that of the Shah of Iran, which
disappeared during the war with Iraq.

317
00:21:53.849 --> 00:21:56.144
It is rumored that Saddam stole.

318
00:21:56.174 --> 00:21:57.921
And we recovered a
in Operation Desert Storm. "

319
00:21:57.951 --> 00:22:00.466
I recovered and molds.

320
00:22:01.893 --> 00:22:05.086
No matter. Should
other media to remove notes.

321
00:22:05.645 --> 00:22:07.371
Sir ...

322
00:22:08.269 --> 00:22:09.966
This happens
even as we speak.

323
00:22:13.767 --> 00:22:17.300
Iraqis have captured what's left
the National Printing Office,

324
00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:20.343
to print billions of dollars.

325
00:22:20.383 --> 00:22:23.568
And how are they going to remove
money and dies in Baghdad?

326
00:22:23.607 --> 00:22:27.619
Military convoy. People
former Iraqi secret service.

327
00:22:27.659 --> 00:22:28.647
Yes.

328
00:22:28.677 --> 00:22:30.564
Speed and targeted.

329
00:22:30.594 --> 00:22:32.659
How do you plan to stop them?

330
00:22:38.537 --> 00:22:41.351
There are rumors about someone dies

331
00:22:41.371 --> 00:22:44.136
which are out of town
by Saddam loyalists.

332
00:22:44.176 --> 00:22:45.503
Know something about this?

333
00:22:45.543 --> 00:22:49.065
Seriously. If you are planning
a recovery mission,

334
00:22:49.095 --> 00:22:50.881
warn,

335
00:22:50.921 --> 00:22:53.226
because it is my responsibility,
and job at stake.

336
00:22:53.266 --> 00:22:54.593
Seriously.

337
00:22:55.622 --> 00:22:57.019
Made.

338
00:22:57.039 --> 00:22:59.025
Take you to court martial.

339
00:22:59.743 --> 00:23:00.322
Okay.

340
00:23:00.862 --> 00:23:02.799
Understand the message.

341
00:23:02.829 --> 00:23:04.954
Send it and your lover
Colonel Smith.

342
00:23:04.994 --> 00:23:07.030
Not approaching Baghdad.

343
00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:08.257
You know ...

344
00:23:08.297 --> 00:23:12.319
Do not you come back again.
I thought he would come back.

345
00:23:12.348 --> 00:23:14.284
Now I am back.

346
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:20.152
Diablo, Nini esta ...

347
00:23:23.195 --> 00:23:24.792
You think they would succeed this?

348
00:23:24.822 --> 00:23:29.503
I would not say that ever
but are the best unit in the Army.

349
00:23:29.543 --> 00:23:31.908
Are specialists, but also ridiculous.

350
00:23:31.938 --> 00:23:36.848
- Do not lose the eye.
- Yes, madam.

351
00:23:39.183 --> 00:23:41.169
Diablo is not the devil?

352
00:23:41.229 --> 00:23:42.047
Yes.

353
00:23:43.624 --> 00:23:45.590
Zounds, Hannibal!
And what do you do?

354
00:23:45.629 --> 00:23:49.302
If it was my operation
and you wanted it, a first.

355
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:54.092
If you leave the Black Forest to be involved
one to become an international incident.

356
00:23:54.132 --> 00:23:57.256
There are soldiers, are only
students with fingers on the trigger.

357
00:23:57.286 --> 00:23:59.172
Who lead the field?

358
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:00.899
Pike.

359
00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.556
It's a bully, a character
cartoons.

360
00:24:07.586 --> 00:24:10.599
Hannibal, I received orders.

361
00:24:10.639 --> 00:24:13.253
Order to not get close to Baghdad.

362
00:24:13.283 --> 00:24:15.838
- And that's that.
- General ...

363
00:24:16.606 --> 00:24:18.592
Should I leave
little room for maneuver.

364
00:24:18.632 --> 00:24:21.336
I knew a Lynch.

365
00:24:21.376 --> 00:24:25.038
CIA agent stationed in Laos
in 1968.

366
00:24:26.725 --> 00:24:27.663
We have no connection.

367
00:24:27.693 --> 00:24:29.399
Are you sure?
Because I remember him.

368
00:24:32.214 --> 00:24:34.280
Go to Kabul in a few hours.

369
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:37.173
I turn over two days,
Assuming you clear the problem.

370
00:24:37.403 --> 00:24:39.220
Let him and others.

371
00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:42.144
Wearing bulletproof vest in basic.

372
00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:46.594
That should tell you
everything you should know about the CIA.

373
00:24:56.534 --> 00:24:59.578
I know that this has connection
with that of old.

374
00:24:59.598 --> 00:25:00.845
I know that ...

375
00:25:02.112 --> 00:25:04.398
Are ten times as man
only when I have known.

376
00:25:04.428 --> 00:25:06.684
I grow up quickly.

377
00:25:07.852 --> 00:25:11.595
Russ, I and my people can
settle this without bloodshed.

378
00:25:11.635 --> 00:25:13.661
Those molds can
all sorts of damage.

379
00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.207
Do not make me beg.

380
00:25:15.247 --> 00:25:16.944
I would love to see you begging.

381
00:25:20.027 --> 00:25:22.492
Are you my friend of many years.

382
00:25:22.532 --> 00:25:30.295
Most importantly, you and your people
are the most valuable unit

383
00:25:30.325 --> 00:25:32.550
that I ever had
under control.

384
00:25:33.648 --> 00:25:35.914
Tell me you do not beg.

385
00:25:37.411 --> 00:25:38.908
Now I beg you.

386
00:25:39.866 --> 00:25:42.700
Hannibal, please do not engage
this mission.

387
00:25:46.413 --> 00:25:47.949
Listen B.A.

388
00:25:48.109 --> 00:25:50.314
Live longer than stay.

389
00:25:50.354 --> 00:25:53.408
- We go to Baghdad.
- We have orders not to go there.

390
00:25:53.438 --> 00:25:55.224
- That's true but ...
- Smith.

391
00:25:57.030 --> 00:25:57.669
Pike.

392
00:25:57.699 --> 00:26:01.650
I understand that you and your gorilla
I steal missions. I hate that.

393
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:07.818
I thought that you are busy
set up to establish the dictatorship somewhere.

394
00:26:09.145 --> 00:26:10.263
It's still the weekend.

395
00:26:10.303 --> 00:26:12.109
For those things we do
during the week.

396
00:26:12.219 --> 00:26:13.725
Pops.

397
00:26:13.905 --> 00:26:15.213
Look at you.

398
00:26:15.253 --> 00:26:17.150
Not soldiers.

399
00:26:17.190 --> 00:26:20.812
You are assassins in polo shirts.

400
00:26:22.678 --> 00:26:24.584
We do in a week
as you do in a year.

401
00:26:24.624 --> 00:26:27.089
Soldiers brave, boy.

402
00:26:27.129 --> 00:26:29.514
And intelligence.

403
00:26:29.554 --> 00:26:31.160
You are missing you both.

404
00:26:33.306 --> 00:26:37.068
This is the Morrison's.
You stay in my operations.

405
00:26:37.108 --> 00:26:40.113
We have half a tank ...

406
00:26:40.143 --> 00:26:42.139
I say, came here for a reason.

407
00:26:42.179 --> 00:26:44.144
Do, and I said, forget it.

408
00:26:44.174 --> 00:26:45.861
The level of ambition at this woman ...

409
00:26:45.871 --> 00:26:47.388
I always put my foot
the plane, Colonel.

410
00:26:47.428 --> 00:26:50.741
Neither the gliders, paper airplanes,
ultralight ...

411
00:26:50.771 --> 00:26:52.248
- I let me make it up?
- No.

412
00:26:52.268 --> 00:26:55.611
The story of Mexico has been strong recently.
I saved your life.

413
00:26:55.651 --> 00:26:57.657
You should thank me
I have not beaten there in the hospital.

414
00:26:57.677 --> 00:26:59.034
I was parachutist.

415
00:26:59.074 --> 00:27:00.680
And fear as a hen.

416
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:02.107
263 jumps.

417
00:27:02.137 --> 00:27:03.225
One would be thanks enough.

418
00:27:03.255 --> 00:27:08.164
A helicopter flight we do not change.
Paratroopers are not afraid to fly.

419
00:27:08.244 --> 00:27:09.801
B.A., for the last time ...

420
00:27:09.821 --> 00:27:12.306
Nobody leaves the truck
after you catch.

421
00:27:12.446 --> 00:27:13.534
Okay?

422
00:27:13.574 --> 00:27:15.779
Drafts.

423
00:27:15.809 --> 00:27:17.984
Movements. Action Plan.

424
00:27:18.293 --> 00:27:19.871
Have a nice reading.

425
00:27:21.637 --> 00:27:23.893
So, Hannibal! That's it!

426
00:27:25.699 --> 00:27:27.555
It's madness.

427
00:27:28.822 --> 00:27:29.580
That's perfect.

428
00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.935
That's beyond crazy.

429
00:27:36.356 --> 00:27:37.523
Becomes better.

430
00:27:39.479 --> 00:27:42.772
B.A., we need a piece
metal to make a ramp.

431
00:27:42.782 --> 00:27:44.031
Come on, fool.

432
00:27:44.051 --> 00:27:46.236
Murdock, we need a battery.

433
00:27:46.276 --> 00:27:48.980
See if the boys in Black Forest
We can help.

434
00:27:49.728 --> 00:27:51.755
Press badge.
We need them.

435
00:27:51.895 --> 00:27:54.389
Check the program statements
Press and see what we spades in hand.

436
00:27:54.419 --> 00:27:58.102
Dude, I see you let down
sound amplifier.

437
00:27:58.131 --> 00:28:00.247
Microphone from CNN
always put on top.

438
00:28:00.287 --> 00:28:02.931
There are two cables,
make sure you ...

439
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:09.767
Murdock, we need
of a camera.

440
00:28:09.797 --> 00:28:11.154
See what you find.

441
00:28:14.357 --> 00:28:16.463
Excuse me.

442
00:28:16.493 --> 00:28:18.289
Hello.

443
00:28:18.409 --> 00:28:20.596
I am ...
I'm in love with you.

444
00:28:20.615 --> 00:28:24.668
Do you think we could make a ...
What did we talk? About retirement.

445
00:28:24.708 --> 00:28:26.913
A need to have
airbags.

446
00:28:26.943 --> 00:28:28.170
Many airbags.

447
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:30.326
- What newspaper are you?
- Le Monde.

448
00:28:30.625 --> 00:28:31.892
You Frenchwoman.

449
00:28:37.421 --> 00:28:40.096
- Are generally Parker. I need ...
- Okay.

450
00:28:40.126 --> 00:28:41.273
This is for you.

451
00:28:41.293 --> 00:28:43.319
Command and a single air strike.

452
00:28:43.708 --> 00:28:48.449
- Okay. See you there.
- No. We should go ...

453
00:28:48.479 --> 00:28:51.103
Should understand
what I say now.

454
00:28:51.143 --> 00:28:52.840
B.A., one we need to
a magnet.

455
00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:55.575
One strong.

456
00:28:59.097 --> 00:29:00.594
Have you ever seen Blue Man Group?

457
00:29:02.710 --> 00:29:03.707
The rest I do myself.

458
00:29:21.411 --> 00:29:25.322
Why did you give for a chance
to return here

459
00:29:25.342 --> 00:29:29.514
and tell the enemy
we may take life,

460
00:29:29.554 --> 00:29:33.566
but we will never
freedom!

461
00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:43.834
Are you ready?
Good luck.

462
00:29:43.864 --> 00:29:46.069
- Thanks.
- I could not help it.

463
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:53.775
General Morrison
Where is Hannibal Smith?

464
00:29:54.114 --> 00:29:56.539
Will leave the road in three hours.

465
00:29:57.577 --> 00:30:02.617
Molds and over one billion dollars
loaded into the back of the truck.

466
00:30:03.655 --> 00:30:08.066
Have to go exactly 7.4 km
until reaching the bridge.

467
00:30:12.317 --> 00:30:14.163
There our window ...

468
00:30:14.183 --> 00:30:15.630
And close quickly.

469
00:30:19.272 --> 00:30:22.246
These guys will open fire
The first sign of trouble.

470
00:30:27.316 --> 00:30:30.529
Make your point of entry
the hotel's basement.

471
00:30:32.177 --> 00:30:34.462
The place is full of guards.

472
00:30:52.284 --> 00:30:55.817
B.A., you sit in the alley
it stops the timer.

473
00:30:55.847 --> 00:30:59.699
- Have the bike ready.
- We go.

474
00:30:59.739 --> 00:31:01.376
There.

475
00:31:02.264 --> 00:31:04.211
About me, boss?

476
00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.293
I had a helicopter
somewhere.

477
00:31:08.323 --> 00:31:11.635
You have a few turns, stops the air?

478
00:31:12.254 --> 00:31:16.226
Looking for the next experience
near death.

479
00:31:16.256 --> 00:31:19.319
That only air support mission,
but they place the next.

480
00:31:19.339 --> 00:31:20.716
I promise.

481
00:31:20.756 --> 00:31:22.113
B.A.

482
00:31:22.502 --> 00:31:24.977
Fireworks start at 6:03.

483
00:31:28.151 --> 00:31:29.538
It's from me?

484
00:31:29.558 --> 00:31:32.242
No, I forgot. Are in a sewer
Iraq. Thanks, boss.

485
00:31:36.814 --> 00:31:39.488
Synchronization is everything, It.

486
00:31:40.815 --> 00:31:43.489
It's about precision.

487
00:31:50.065 --> 00:31:51.462
Why not?

488
00:31:52.690 --> 00:31:57.351
When you are under the trailer
Lose your truck from behind.

489
00:32:09.287 --> 00:32:11.394
These guys will come after you, is.

490
00:32:11.434 --> 00:32:13.879
B.A., then turn on you.

491
00:32:13.918 --> 00:32:16.254
Be sure to look both ways
before crossing,

492
00:32:16.273 --> 00:32:18.708
and the petrol tank is full.

493
00:32:29.585 --> 00:32:32.320
Will be more hostile to the board, B.A.

494
00:32:34.276 --> 00:32:36.511
Remove them from the perimeter.

495
00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:56.639
If approaching snipers back
do not worry.

496
00:32:56.649 --> 00:32:57.947
You keep me back.

497
00:33:09.832 --> 00:33:11.369
Gotcha.

498
00:33:11.798 --> 00:33:13.226
Bravo.

499
00:33:14.214 --> 00:33:17.577
Theory looks good, but still do not understand
a way out of Baghdad.

500
00:33:18.804 --> 00:33:19.522
I understand.

501
00:33:19.552 --> 00:33:21.758
B.A., turns right.

502
00:33:21.788 --> 00:33:23.794
Okay. Hang.

503
00:33:29.043 --> 00:33:30.670
- Be careful!
- Head down!

504
00:33:33.573 --> 00:33:35.291
Bravo B.A.!

505
00:33:36.329 --> 00:33:38.614
Made, removing airbags.

506
00:33:38.654 --> 00:33:41.519
We must ensure that it floats.

507
00:33:41.958 --> 00:33:43.355
Wonderful.

508
00:33:43.993 --> 00:33:46.110
One, two, three ...

509
00:33:51.119 --> 00:33:53.993
Chief, airbags are activated
impact, eh?

510
00:33:55.530 --> 00:33:57.585
B.A., pass into the container.

511
00:33:59.322 --> 00:34:01.108
We are attacked from behind.

512
00:34:19.311 --> 00:34:21.596
That's the plan
I have no confidence.

513
00:34:21.636 --> 00:34:24.001
Do not worry, It.
Are double wheels.

514
00:34:24.041 --> 00:34:26.585
If I was worried,
I hung container.

515
00:34:27.314 --> 00:34:28.641
Hang on, guys.

516
00:34:47.722 --> 00:34:51.096
We've shown me you!
Did you see the explosion?

517
00:34:51.126 --> 00:34:53.441
Murdock? What fool search here?

518
00:34:53.511 --> 00:34:55.826
Do not leave me locked up here!

519
00:34:56.016 --> 00:34:58.221
Boss, you played in that device
they need to raise

520
00:34:58.241 --> 00:34:59.937
a stuffed animal with a claw?

521
00:35:00.616 --> 00:35:02.282
It's like now.

522
00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:03.769
So.

523
00:35:04.986 --> 00:35:07.112
Have you locked it?

524
00:35:07.152 --> 00:35:09.337
Let me out of here.

525
00:35:09.367 --> 00:35:11.673
What are you doing? Even to ...

526
00:35:11.703 --> 00:35:13.000
Stay on top?

527
00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.114
What the hell is happening?
Are you crazy?

528
00:35:16.134 --> 00:35:17.910
Kill you, fools.

529
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:19.147
Bosco? You?

530
00:35:19.187 --> 00:35:20.454
Let me out of here!

531
00:35:20.494 --> 00:35:22.571
Let me out!

532
00:35:22.611 --> 00:35:24.317
That's not good. Does not seem happy.

533
00:35:45.844 --> 00:35:48.059
Ross. We landed.

534
00:35:48.099 --> 00:35:51.043
Roger.
Arrive in five minutes.

535
00:35:51.063 --> 00:35:52.939
I have with me a large bottle of whiskey.

536
00:35:52.979 --> 00:35:54.427
A bottle?

537
00:35:54.467 --> 00:35:57.141
Give us a shuttle.

538
00:35:57.181 --> 00:35:58.458
Who gives way?

539
00:35:59.676 --> 00:36:01.162
You!

540
00:36:01.232 --> 00:36:04.665
I will not tell you
that will kill you all!

541
00:36:04.705 --> 00:36:07.649
Kill you all!

542
00:36:07.679 --> 00:36:10.902
Chief, let me try something.

543
00:36:10.942 --> 00:36:12.239
Tries.

544
00:36:12.249 --> 00:36:14.484
Strange that they are more scared now
than during the mission?

545
00:36:14.514 --> 00:36:16.341
Bosco? 'm Murdock.

546
00:36:16.361 --> 00:36:18.337
Murdock, open the door!

547
00:36:18.377 --> 00:36:21.560
I make curry with coconut
as you like.

548
00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:22.538
It might work.

549
00:36:24.414 --> 00:36:26.141
And fried snacks?

550
00:36:26.161 --> 00:36:27.598
Course and fried snacks.

551
00:36:27.638 --> 00:36:29.534
- Snacks Simple ...
- Let 's go.

552
00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:34.134
- Here it is!
- I've cheated.

553
00:36:34.164 --> 00:36:34.753
I hate that.

554
00:36:34.783 --> 00:36:36.309
- Come on!
- Get away from me.

555
00:36:36.339 --> 00:36:39.223
I shook all parties.

556
00:36:39.253 --> 00:36:41.059
You know I hate flying.

557
00:36:41.089 --> 00:36:44.702
Are wet, smell ...
Not anymore money.

558
00:36:44.731 --> 00:36:45.939
Money does not buy happiness.

559
00:36:45.979 --> 00:36:49.842
Murdock, cook tonight.
Get ready for work.

560
00:36:52.855 --> 00:36:55.430
I love it when a plan
ends well.

561
00:37:01.539 --> 00:37:03.514
- Hannibal, who was in the car?
- General!

562
00:37:03.534 --> 00:37:04.193
Was general?

563
00:37:04.223 --> 00:37:06.877
Damn! General!

564
00:37:07.416 --> 00:37:08.594
Ross!

565
00:37:08.763 --> 00:37:10.400
General!

566
00:37:10.709 --> 00:37:11.637
God!

567
00:37:18.034 --> 00:37:19.991
Pike!
We are attacked from behind!

568
00:37:23.833 --> 00:37:25.110
Move!

569
00:37:26.876 --> 00:37:28.054
Get down!

570
00:38:10.297 --> 00:38:11.524
After we consulted

571
00:38:11.534 --> 00:38:14.717
I decided to go backward
the rank of first lieutenant.

572
00:38:16.084 --> 00:38:19.587
Lieutenant Sosa's nothing personal.
Lost molds.

573
00:38:19.627 --> 00:38:21.882
Were your responsibility.

574
00:38:22.331 --> 00:38:25.196
Consider yourself lucky that you get
to jail for that.

575
00:38:25.226 --> 00:38:27.232
Good day, Mr. Director McCready.

576
00:38:27.252 --> 00:38:28.489
Lieutenant. Are free.

577
00:38:28.519 --> 00:38:33.289
Colonel Smith, the Court found
no direct order

578
00:38:33.319 --> 00:38:35.435
from General Morrison

579
00:38:35.455 --> 00:38:38.539
for deployment
which are final.

580
00:38:38.568 --> 00:38:40.963
Honor,
was a secret operation.

581
00:38:40.993 --> 00:38:43.428
There has been no official order.

582
00:38:44.655 --> 00:38:48.388
So only one who can confirm
legitimacy of this operation

583
00:38:48.407 --> 00:38:50.264
died. Right, Colonel?

584
00:38:50.293 --> 00:38:51.142
No, your honor.

585
00:38:51.182 --> 00:38:54.095
Has not died.
General Morrison was murdered.

586
00:38:54.135 --> 00:38:59.006
Colonel, are in the army a long time.
I've seen units like yours.

587
00:38:59.046 --> 00:39:00.893
They are wicked.

588
00:39:00.903 --> 00:39:03.427
Such units have
a direct threat

589
00:39:03.467 --> 00:39:06.442
for rules and conduct military.

590
00:39:06.971 --> 00:39:10.763
Judge, Black Forest drive
Why was not brought before the court?

591
00:39:10.803 --> 00:39:16.281
Black Forest is personal
not subject to military rules.

592
00:39:17.139 --> 00:39:18.757
What's the plan, boss?

593
00:39:18.916 --> 00:39:20.343
Where is dropping?

594
00:39:20.373 --> 00:39:23.277
The mission was not finished yet
Lieutenant.

595
00:39:23.806 --> 00:39:26.161
We rehabilitated name

596
00:39:26.201 --> 00:39:28.078
we find Pike and molds.

597
00:39:28.108 --> 00:39:30.333
Whatever it takes.

598
00:39:31.371 --> 00:39:34.694
Your honor, these people
acted under my orders.

599
00:39:34.734 --> 00:39:37.887
Any action should be taken
only on me.

600
00:39:37.917 --> 00:39:41.410
No, sir. I attended all
voluntarily in this mission.

601
00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:44.434
- I want to be judged separately.
- Refusal to be tried separately.

602
00:39:44.464 --> 00:39:48.555
Under military code and that
justice, the Court awarded sentences

603
00:39:48.565 --> 00:39:51.179
each member
Alfa unit, or A-Team

604
00:39:51.219 --> 00:39:55.610
and require incarceration in prison
to safely separate

605
00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:57.875
a period of up to ten years.

606
00:39:57.905 --> 00:40:01.528
You are all free of rank

607
00:40:01.558 --> 00:40:03.694
and disband the dishonored.

608
00:40:07.366 --> 00:40:08.553
This is bullshit.

609
00:40:08.823 --> 00:40:10.470
Meeting suspended.

610
00:40:16.308 --> 00:40:19.321
- A shame.
- Do not get me.

611
00:40:20.319 --> 00:40:22.525
Quiet room!

612
00:40:22.684 --> 00:40:23.882
A shame!

613
00:40:23.892 --> 00:40:25.768
Are you happy, Charisse?

614
00:40:25.798 --> 00:40:28.143
- Colonel, control your people.
- Get your hands off me!

615
00:40:36.517 --> 00:40:38.193
Six months later

616
00:40:38.682 --> 00:40:43.832
MILITARY Detention Center
Fort Carson, Colorado

617
00:40:49.521 --> 00:40:51.447
Hello, Mr. Lynch.

618
00:40:51.477 --> 00:40:53.014
Been a while.

619
00:40:53.043 --> 00:40:57.404
You seem very relaxed.
There are many rooms here.

620
00:40:57.434 --> 00:40:59.350
Yes, that's so

621
00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.093
It seems that currently
have a technical fault.

622
00:41:03.133 --> 00:41:05.189
Go to resume.

623
00:41:05.218 --> 00:41:07.803
Hannibal ...
I can tell you Hannibal?

624
00:41:08.142 --> 00:41:10.188
Colonel can not tell you.

625
00:41:10.228 --> 00:41:12.114
Six months.

626
00:41:12.144 --> 00:41:19.010
I waited to escape from here
to collect the rest of your team

627
00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.457
and bring me dies.

628
00:41:20.487 --> 00:41:23.061
For six months I have heard
anything for you.

629
00:41:23.091 --> 00:41:26.155
Everyone thought
that you and your team work with Pike.

630
00:41:27.632 --> 00:41:29.308
Everyone except you.

631
00:41:30.935 --> 00:41:32.950
Pike killed Morrison.

632
00:41:32.990 --> 00:41:35.735
He set me up this to me
and my boys and stolen molds.

633
00:41:40.865 --> 00:41:42.492
I know where e.

634
00:41:44.428 --> 00:41:46.004
Nobody knows where e.

635
00:41:50.865 --> 00:41:52.003
It's the only photo with him.

636
00:41:52.043 --> 00:41:55.046
He was made a month ago,
somewhere in Europe.

637
00:41:55.076 --> 00:41:58.379
We believe that image
is from a surveillance camera.

638
00:42:00.714 --> 00:42:02.670
Frankfurt. Germany.

639
00:42:05.055 --> 00:42:06.692
How did you get that here?

640
00:42:06.732 --> 00:42:10.305
Time, Lynch.
Give me a minute and I'm good.

641
00:42:10.324 --> 00:42:12.390
If I get an hour is great.

642
00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:14.565
If you give me six months,

643
00:42:14.595 --> 00:42:15.693
are invincible.

644
00:42:15.923 --> 00:42:19.057
I know Pike.
Who is Arab?

645
00:42:19.117 --> 00:42:20.075
We do not know.

646
00:42:20.105 --> 00:42:23.757
We think he's the man
behind the whole thing.

647
00:42:23.787 --> 00:42:26.301
Can a broker, a buyer may.

648
00:42:27.599 --> 00:42:29.544
Lynch, we have enemies.

649
00:42:29.574 --> 00:42:31.450
You have limited options.

650
00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:34.335
My team has the best
chance to recover molds.

651
00:42:34.365 --> 00:42:37.489
- I'm not so sure.
- Then why did you come up here?

652
00:42:37.528 --> 00:42:40.962
You and your men in Langley
you print your own.

653
00:42:40.992 --> 00:42:43.616
So much about your patriotism.

654
00:42:43.956 --> 00:42:46.091
What you need from me?

655
00:42:46.820 --> 00:42:49.574
I promised my team
that they will rehabilitate the name.

656
00:42:49.614 --> 00:42:52.250
You understand best
value of a name.

657
00:42:56.202 --> 00:42:56.940
Listen.

658
00:42:56.980 --> 00:43:00.133
I throw depending

659
00:43:00.173 --> 00:43:02.927
and clean my folders

660
00:43:02.967 --> 00:43:04.703
and for my team.

661
00:43:04.743 --> 00:43:05.931
I can not get you out of here.

662
00:43:07.477 --> 00:43:09.174
Not legally, at least.

663
00:43:10.203 --> 00:43:13.785
That's something that me and boys
We understand very well.

664
00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:16.190
Make sure that the dosage is appropriate.
IN TETRODOTOXINA Cigar

665
00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:19.762
And when I say right
I mean perfect.

666
00:43:28.215 --> 00:43:29.662
Cuban.

667
00:43:29.752 --> 00:43:30.740
What a pity.

668
00:43:37.915 --> 00:43:40.748
Crematorium

669
00:44:18.991 --> 00:44:21.377
You is not allowed

670
00:44:21.397 --> 00:44:26.107
to get into my room.

671
00:44:29.141 --> 00:44:31.955
Satan walks into a bar ...

672
00:44:33.981 --> 00:44:36.505
Wait a minute. What's this?
A pool?

673
00:44:36.535 --> 00:44:38.082
Sauna?

674
00:44:38.112 --> 00:44:40.327
Yes, I know for a long time
with boys.

675
00:44:40.367 --> 00:44:42.722
How do you do that?

676
00:44:42.762 --> 00:44:45.606
It's not who you know Bob
but as you know.

677
00:44:45.636 --> 00:44:48.132
Your boy is back
Afghanistan?

678
00:44:48.172 --> 00:44:49.848
Yes, thank you for bringing him home.

679
00:44:49.888 --> 00:44:51.963
Me and his mother are you
very grateful.

680
00:44:52.003 --> 00:44:52.971
Captain.

681
00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:54.119
Hello.

682
00:44:54.159 --> 00:44:55.925
You forgot something on the bed.

683
00:44:59.389 --> 00:45:00.606
I could hide.

684
00:45:00.636 --> 00:45:02.133
Why I wanted to do this?

685
00:45:03.021 --> 00:45:04.607
I'm mad.
See you later.

686
00:45:04.637 --> 00:45:06.354
Lieutenant, thank you
for boots.

687
00:45:06.384 --> 00:45:08.729
What the hell! It was my pleasure.

688
00:45:13.959 --> 00:45:15.974
Smith escaped, Lieutenant.

689
00:45:17.032 --> 00:45:18.470
Let me go after him.

690
00:45:18.510 --> 00:45:21.703
Smith and his team work
with Pike and Black Forest.

691
00:45:21.723 --> 00:45:23.938
Can you make molds
back, sir.

692
00:45:25.615 --> 00:45:27.251
You know I can do that.

693
00:45:38.069 --> 00:45:40.135
Let me go!

694
00:45:54.754 --> 00:45:57.479
Are very tan.

695
00:46:00.243 --> 00:46:01.750
Stay on guard.
No one enters there.

696
00:46:04.225 --> 00:46:06.930
Data from day
were deleted.

697
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.208
Why not surprise me that?

698
00:46:08.248 --> 00:46:11.680
Cigar was in that book.

699
00:46:12.608 --> 00:46:14.903
- Subtle.
- Be careful.

700
00:46:14.923 --> 00:46:18.077
Image cameras
from prison. Yes?

701
00:46:18.117 --> 00:46:20.272
What you see
is a jamming device.

702
00:46:20.282 --> 00:46:22.967
It's high-tech locks
signal cameras

703
00:46:22.987 --> 00:46:24.774
whenever we have the chance
to catch him in the face.

704
00:46:24.804 --> 00:46:27.588
I see nothing.
Nobody knows who e.

705
00:46:27.618 --> 00:46:31.031
Which brings us to another question.
CIA Smith visited him in jail?

706
00:46:31.061 --> 00:46:34.194
Sounds crazy, but I think
that the CIA helped him escape.

707
00:46:34.334 --> 00:46:35.981
Who hired you?

708
00:46:36.011 --> 00:46:37.987
Same person
we undertook in Baghdad.

709
00:46:38.027 --> 00:46:40.212
Lynch. CIA.

710
00:46:40.252 --> 00:46:41.440
What are we talking here?

711
00:46:41.470 --> 00:46:43.555
Clean files, rehabilitation ...

712
00:46:43.695 --> 00:46:45.890
All of the above.

713
00:46:45.930 --> 00:46:48.116
What about Pike and dies?

714
00:46:48.185 --> 00:46:50.121
Revenge.

715
00:46:51.628 --> 00:46:53.344
Understand that you have become
religious in prison.

716
00:46:53.354 --> 00:46:54.433
There ...

717
00:46:54.473 --> 00:46:56.319
I became spiteful.

718
00:46:56.359 --> 00:46:57.556
All right.

719
00:47:00.291 --> 00:47:02.576
I know some guys who feel the same.

720
00:47:03.304 --> 00:47:04.532
I count on that.

721
00:47:05.290 --> 00:47:09.811

Hannibal.

727
00:47:45.847 --> 00:47:48.272
Baracus! Do not do it.

728
00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:50.926
- Where did it go?
- What to do?

729
00:47:53.233 --> 00:47:54.520
Baracus! Oh hell!

730
00:48:01.596 --> 00:48:04.410
- Sosa.
- Baracus and Peck have already died.

731
00:48:04.450 --> 00:48:06.056
- What?
- Murdock is the only remaining.

732
00:48:06.096 --> 00:48:07.603
- It's in Germany.
- Yes.

733
00:48:18.990 --> 00:48:21.764
How did you know that after the snatch
door to him bear the weight?

734
00:48:21.794 --> 00:48:23.729
I simply knew.

735
00:48:23.739 --> 00:48:25.705
- What is it? 100 pounds?
- 105.

736
00:48:25.935 --> 00:48:29.038
Remember the guy from Venezuela
seven years ago?

737
00:48:29.078 --> 00:48:30.346
Yes.

738
00:48:30.376 --> 00:48:31.753
But that was a dwarf.

739
00:48:31.793 --> 00:48:34.478
Here it is.

740
00:48:34.507 --> 00:48:37.032
- S back.
- Yes ...

741
00:48:37.072 --> 00:48:38.379
Glad I came.

742
00:48:38.419 --> 00:48:39.936
My man!

00:48:39.976 --> 00:48:41.652
- Glad to see you.
- I you.

744
00:48:42.381 --> 00:48:43.468
Thank you.

745
00:48:43.508 --> 00:48:45.585
- Looking good.
- Glad to see you.

746
00:48:50.315 --> 00:48:50.864
What?

747
00:48:50.903 --> 00:48:51.981
Where is the ridge?

748
00:48:52.021 --> 00:48:54.097
Do not you like my new haircut?

749
00:48:55.683 --> 00:48:58.238
If you like it?
I got lawn equipment.

750
00:48:58.358 --> 00:48:59.964
Yes. I have used.

751
00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:04.276
How are you?

752
00:49:06.531 --> 00:49:08.587
You can talk with us.

753
00:49:08.726 --> 00:49:10.622
Boys ...

754
00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:14.005
I can not kill anybody.

755
00:49:17.179 --> 00:49:17.888
What do you mean?

756
00:49:17.918 --> 00:49:19.894
We made a vow.

757
00:49:21.011 --> 00:49:25.043
- A vow?
- You know that I would do anything for you.

758
00:49:26.879 --> 00:49:28.525
But I can not even kill anybody.

759
00:49:29.763 --> 00:49:31.658
Perhaps old habits
die hard

760
00:49:32.088 --> 00:49:34.523
but all must perish.

761
00:49:35.262 --> 00:49:38.315
When I was a child
not heard in district

762
00:49:38.345 --> 00:49:42.467
than guns and thugs,
who received awards.

763
00:49:43.276 --> 00:49:45.730
From there came and crest.

764
00:49:47.307 --> 00:49:48.685
I was always war.

765
00:49:48.715 --> 00:49:51.250
To this are fighters.

766
00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.195
Hannibal can not
to go back to that.

767
00:49:54.243 --> 00:49:56.249
It helps release the Murdock,

768
00:49:58.555 --> 00:49:59.603
but can not kill anybody.

769
00:49:59.643 --> 00:50:03.006
Neither Pike? Even if this
we rehabilitate the name?

770
00:50:04.333 --> 00:50:07.267
My conscience is above.

771
00:50:07.986 --> 00:50:11.079
Where is that fool rattling?

772
00:50:17.695 --> 00:50:21.488
Military Hospital Psychiatry
Mannheim, Germany

773
00:50:21.748 --> 00:50:22.316
Murdock.

774
00:50:22.356 --> 00:50:23.544
Have you received a package ...

775
00:50:23.574 --> 00:50:26.028
... by Hannibal Smith.

776
00:50:31.038 --> 00:50:34.700
- What are these?
- Are so great!

777
00:50:34.810 --> 00:50:36.765
Movie!

778
00:50:36.775 --> 00:50:40.209
Are knight.
Sir, I need to bend your head.

779
00:50:40.229 --> 00:50:42.404
- Get on your feet.
- Movie!

780
00:50:42.424 --> 00:50:45.169
When you get up, bend your head.
I must not look in her eyes.

781
00:50:45.208 --> 00:50:47.055
Movie!

782
00:50:47.084 --> 00:50:48.941
Now you can watch me.
Talk to you.

783
00:50:48.970 --> 00:50:51.295
Movie!

784
00:50:55.817 --> 00:50:57.553
Movie!

785
00:51:02.433 --> 00:51:04.119
Excuse me. May I help you?

786
00:51:04.159 --> 00:51:06.504
Yes. Where is Captain Murdock?

787
00:51:06.544 --> 00:51:08.361
- In.
- Thanks.

788
00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.056
Police.

789
00:51:12.254 --> 00:51:14.419
Okay, quiet. Sit down.

790
00:51:22.073 --> 00:51:25.117
- Be careful, they are 3D.
- Are great.

791
00:51:26.944 --> 00:51:27.842
Captain Murdock.

792
00:51:27.972 --> 00:51:29.699
Remember me?

793
00:51:29.728 --> 00:51:31.405
Baghdad?

794
00:51:37.652 --> 00:51:40.974
- He has no point. It led to the raft.
- That it is here.

795
00:51:41.004 --> 00:51:43.909
And all his team escaped
than he.

796
00:51:44.947 --> 00:51:46.613
Film.

797
00:51:46.633 --> 00:51:48.879
Check the building.
To ensure that it alone.

798
00:51:48.918 --> 00:51:51.104
Yes, madam.

799
00:52:04.227 --> 00:52:05.474
Great Escape

800
00:52:18.777 --> 00:52:21.103
Captain? Waiting coach.

801
00:52:21.113 --> 00:52:23.079
Sorry, gotta go.
I can not stand the movie.

802
00:52:23.118 --> 00:52:24.545
Tell me how it ends.

803
00:52:24.555 --> 00:52:26.851
Charis, where are you?
Keep your beautiful baby.

804
00:52:26.861 --> 00:52:28.796
- Take care, B.A.
- Run!

805
00:52:31.322 --> 00:52:32.529
Bring the car!

806
00:52:34.435 --> 00:52:36.241
Just shoot us!

807
00:52:36.281 --> 00:52:38.038
- Have you seen bullet in 3D?
- Get inside.

808
00:52:38.068 --> 00:52:41.790
- Do you feel that you shoot.
- I shoot you, fool!

809
00:52:43.616 --> 00:52:44.753
Freeze!

810
00:52:44.783 --> 00:52:47.159
- Go through it.
- I told you to stop!

811
00:52:50.752 --> 00:52:52.119
Sorry, guys.

812
00:52:52.358 --> 00:52:54.015
It seems bound
to the airport.

813
00:52:54.044 --> 00:52:55.471
Let's go.

814
00:53:00.940 --> 00:53:02.218
Gentlemen.

815
00:53:02.248 --> 00:53:04.154
God! It's Hannibal Smith!

816
00:53:04.184 --> 00:53:07.227
It's one of you armed
or wanted?

817
00:53:07.267 --> 00:53:08.365
No.

818
00:53:08.405 --> 00:53:12.087
We are both
which means ...

819
00:53:12.117 --> 00:53:15.072
- It's a bad idea.
- Come on, stop being a child. Get.

820
00:53:15.102 --> 00:53:18.266
- We take the plane?
- For this I joined the army.

821
00:53:18.306 --> 00:53:19.892
It's the only chance of escape.
�mbarbateaza up and climbs on the airplane!

822
00:53:19.922 --> 00:53:23.195
Good luck. Owe, boys.
That's it.

823
00:53:23.225 --> 00:53:25.131
- Who has the keys? I must have it.
- What key are you talking?

824
00:53:25.161 --> 00:53:26.828
- I need keys.
- What?

825
00:53:26.867 --> 00:53:29.612
That's a bad idea.
I just removed from psychiatry.

826
00:53:29.622 --> 00:53:31.548
Hannibal, the pilot let go.

827
00:53:31.558 --> 00:53:33.545
- B.A., calm down. I will be fine.
- Take a pill.

828
00:53:33.555 --> 00:53:35.671
What's this? A I fall asleep?

829
00:53:35.711 --> 00:53:37.926
I'd better sleep,
if you do not I fall asleep.

830
00:53:37.966 --> 00:53:40.241
What buttons to press?

831
00:53:40.281 --> 00:53:41.638
- Shut up.
- Come, Murdock.

832
00:53:41.678 --> 00:53:43.105
This is your plan? Forget it.

833
00:53:43.145 --> 00:53:44.232
I am going to teach me.

834
00:53:44.272 --> 00:53:45.280
- What is?
- Come on.

835
00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.206
- Come, Murdock.
- I was lucky.

836
00:53:48.234 --> 00:53:49.672
Hang on, guys.

837
00:53:56.687 --> 00:53:58.204
Stop.

838
00:54:02.055 --> 00:54:03.772
Make your girlfriend returned.

839
00:54:03.812 --> 00:54:06.168
Put in reverse. Punch it!

840
00:54:06.178 --> 00:54:07.634
Go back!

841
00:54:08.243 --> 00:54:11.536
- Vs. Mecedes Benz C130.
- Off, Murdock.

842
00:54:13.145 --> 00:54:14.115
Go faster.

843
00:54:14.115 --> 00:54:15.752
- Faster!
- I tried.

844
00:54:16.436 --> 00:54:24.098
El Diablo, esta Nini ...

845
00:54:25.653 --> 00:54:27.711
God!

846
00:54:38.768 --> 00:54:40.206
Take us to the tower.

847
00:54:41.655 --> 00:54:44.297
Ladies and gentlemen, we expect
to some turbulence.

848
00:54:44.297 --> 00:54:48.774
Please stay on the job until
master ring signal stops.

849
00:54:48.973 --> 00:54:50.374
Do not worry, boys.

850
00:54:50.374 --> 00:54:53.007
Did not broke turmoil
never a plane.

851
00:54:55.798 --> 00:54:57.222
What the hell is that?

852
00:54:57.222 --> 00:55:01.694
Damn! We footsteps
drones armed with missiles.

853
00:55:01.694 --> 00:55:04.017
They always shoot down planes.

854
00:55:06.518 --> 00:55:07.732
Approaches.

855
00:55:07.732 --> 00:55:09.853
Launch counter-measures.

856
00:55:19.377 --> 00:55:20.493
Have you seen this?

857
00:55:20.493 --> 00:55:23.297
This is my dodge maneuver.

858
00:55:29.149 --> 00:55:30.764
Hang. God!

859
00:55:30.764 --> 00:55:32.443
We twist!

860
00:55:33.014 --> 00:55:35.496
Murdock, what are you doing?

861
00:55:36.183 --> 00:55:39.185
Do you remember Mexico?

862
00:55:40.699 --> 00:55:43.150
Ladies and gentlemen,
your pilot speaking.

863
00:55:43.150 --> 00:55:47.767
If you look on the right window,
a notice that the wing is on fire.

864
00:55:51.076 --> 00:55:52.600
- Tango fixed target.
- Roger.

865
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.102
- Launch rocket.
- Lieutenant Charis Sosa.

866
00:55:55.102 --> 00:55:58.958
Do not fell that plane!
Forced it to land.

867
00:55:58.958 --> 00:56:00.603
People wanted
is in that plane.

868
00:56:00.603 --> 00:56:03.976
- They stole a good American Army.
- Billy, I need room on the plane.

869
00:56:09.039 --> 00:56:10.462
The rocket was launched, sir.

870
00:56:14.141 --> 00:56:15.372
We hit.

871
00:56:15.372 --> 00:56:17.696
Hercules aircraft
was intercepted and shot down.

872
00:56:17.696 --> 00:56:20.252
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

873
00:56:30.127 --> 00:56:33.328
- I do not believe it.
- Sir, we have a tank dropped.

874
00:56:33.328 --> 00:56:34.477
What?

875
00:56:34.477 --> 00:56:38.967
- Disconnect immediately drones!
- There are 1,500 km away.

876
00:56:38.967 --> 00:56:40.317
Give me a direct line ...

877
00:56:40.317 --> 00:56:43.386
Must disconnect drones,
if not gonna have a hard life.

878
00:56:43.386 --> 00:56:44.946
We need those people in life!

879
00:56:50.992 --> 00:56:52.307
Everyone's alright?

880
00:56:52.307 --> 00:56:54.221
What chance have us believe the dead?

881
00:56:56.937 --> 00:56:58.270
Not too big.

882
00:56:58.270 --> 00:57:01.071
- Tell me that we are not on the plane.
- We are not on the plane.

883
00:57:01.071 --> 00:57:02.130
- Hannibal.
- Yes.

884
00:57:02.130 --> 00:57:05.078
If you are under 6000 meters
can breathe, right?

885
00:57:05.078 --> 00:57:06.691
What do you mean 6000 feet?

886
00:57:06.691 --> 00:57:09.250
- To draw some fire.
- What the hell!

887
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:12.534
Bosco, hold tight.
You open a window.

888
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:17.548
Yes!

889
00:57:17.791 --> 00:57:21.255
Show me what you know, you bastards!

890
00:57:22.816 --> 00:57:24.339
Yes!

891
00:57:25.531 --> 00:57:28.663
- Give me along!
- Why we are in a tank?

892
00:57:28.663 --> 00:57:31.281
- For the plane exploded.
- What plan? What?

893
00:57:31.281 --> 00:57:33.156
- When?
- Recently.

894
00:57:33.156 --> 00:57:34.744
They downed drones.

895
00:57:34.744 --> 00:57:36.103
What drones?

896
00:57:38.834 --> 00:57:41.354
Those still trying
to kill us.

897
00:57:41.354 --> 00:57:43.633
- You are to blame, Hannibal.
- Technically, not fly.

898
00:57:43.633 --> 00:57:46.157
I know we are in free fall!

899
00:57:52.113 --> 00:57:53.658
God!

900
00:57:55.096 --> 00:57:57.768
UFC2 was shot down.
We lost a drone.

901
00:57:57.768 --> 00:58:00.831
Hannibal, we have problems!

902
00:58:00.831 --> 00:58:02.364
Hang!

903
00:58:03.825 --> 00:58:05.108
Bestial!

904
00:58:06.391 --> 00:58:10.549
Do, pass the main gun.
It's a lake a mile away.

905
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:12.426
And what you got?

906
00:58:12.426 --> 00:58:15.213
Trust me.
Turn the cannon to 82 degrees.

907
00:58:15.213 --> 00:58:16.695
Fire in the hole!

908
00:58:17.696 --> 00:58:18.753
Fire!

909
00:58:21.091 --> 00:58:21.965
Fire!

910
00:58:25.478 --> 00:58:27.722
Try to shoot down
other drone?

911
00:58:27.722 --> 00:58:28.780
No.

912
00:58:28.780 --> 00:58:30.624
Try to fly the tank.

913
00:58:30.903 --> 00:58:33.818
- Pilot tank!
- You can fly a tank, you fool!

914
00:58:33.818 --> 00:58:35.844
- Turn to 16 degrees.
- I understand.

915
00:58:35.844 --> 00:58:36.877
Fire!

916
00:58:42.085 --> 00:58:43.659
Turn 34 degrees.

917
00:58:43.659 --> 00:58:45.691
- Hannibal.
- Wait.

918
00:58:46.248 --> 00:58:47.125
Fire!

919
00:58:50.941 --> 00:58:52.365
Kicking is confirmed?

920
00:58:52.365 --> 00:58:54.617
Turn the cannon in front and wait.

921
00:58:57.693 --> 00:59:00.403
- Murdock, close turret.
- Okay.

922
00:59:00.403 --> 00:59:02.522
- Did it work?
- Come on, sweetie.

923
00:59:02.522 --> 00:59:04.341
Tank is closed.

924
00:59:05.908 --> 00:59:07.847
They are too young to die!

925
00:59:07.847 --> 00:59:10.453
Boss! I have in the target.

926
00:59:10.745 --> 00:59:13.522
- Come on.
- It was an honor, gentlemen.

927
00:59:13.522 --> 00:59:16.732
- Come on, sweetie!
- The best flight of my life.

928
00:59:16.732 --> 00:59:20.006
- Shoot all you!
- Come on, sweetie!

929
00:59:22.365 --> 00:59:23.504
My driving?

930
00:59:37.367 --> 00:59:40.719
It's not fair to the fish!

931
00:59:40.719 --> 00:59:42.902
Trisorule!

932
00:59:44.510 --> 00:59:47.192
You and your bullshit.

933
00:59:47.192 --> 00:59:48.884
Throw a few ...

934
01:00:07.176 --> 01:00:08.373
Okay ...

935
01:00:08.573 --> 01:00:10.170
Busy bee, busy bee ...

936
01:00:11.267 --> 01:00:12.465
Guys, you can remove clothes.

937
01:00:13.364 --> 01:00:16.058
It is hot here.
Sweat like a slut in a church.

938
01:00:16.258 --> 01:00:17.156
- Sir?
- Yes.

939
01:00:17.355 --> 01:00:19.751
Smith and his team were involved
in a fight in a C130

940
01:00:19.851 --> 01:00:21.647
over the city Meinheim
in Germany.

941
01:00:22.745 --> 01:00:26.936
Not sure if a code
but it says here that sank a tanker.

942
01:00:28.433 --> 01:00:31.228
NORAD has no data
but there are reports on the spot.

943
01:00:33.024 --> 01:00:34.121
I am sure it is.

944
01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.812
A fisherman's wife says
he saw a tank coming out of lake

945
01:00:38.912 --> 01:00:40.309
led by a guy who looked like Murdoch.

946
01:00:40.908 --> 01:00:43.004
Excuse me.
In which direction is Berlin?

947
01:00:43.103 --> 01:00:44.600
Demanding indications to reach Berlin.

948
01:00:44.999 --> 01:00:46.297
That is impossible.

949
01:00:46.697 --> 01:00:49.790
Well, that would be the second time
you died weekly.

950
01:00:50.389 --> 01:00:52.484
That is possible?

951
01:00:57.573 --> 01:00:59.270
- What you got for me?
- Look at this.

952
01:00:59.569 --> 01:01:03.562
We have that picture
with Smith's prison visitor.

953
01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.056
I identified the issue yet.

954
01:01:07.154 --> 01:01:08.351
Hi, handsome.

955
01:01:10.148 --> 01:01:11.644
I've never seen this guy.

956
01:01:12.842 --> 01:01:14.438
I know this guy.

957
01:01:17.134 --> 01:01:18.331
Baghdad ...

958
01:01:19.429 --> 01:01:21.923
Get me to Langley.
Go fishing.

959
01:01:23.021 --> 01:01:23.919
I just heard it.

960
01:01:24.019 --> 01:01:26.613
I mean I heard that Vincent sold in pieces
but how are we involved?

961
01:01:26.648 --> 01:01:27.811
- Sir ...
- I was talking.

962
01:01:27.911 --> 01:01:29.108
- We are not involved.
- Can you stop?

963
01:01:29.407 --> 01:01:31.503
We have a secure line call
Lieutenant from Sosa.

964
01:01:31.802 --> 01:01:33.399
Lynch seeks the agent.

965
01:01:33.599 --> 01:01:36.992
- Not available. Never.
- Agent Lynch in Baghdad.

966
01:01:39.986 --> 01:01:41.383
Tent of General Morrison?

967
01:01:43.578 --> 01:01:44.776
Exit.

968
01:01:46.272 --> 01:01:51.364
- Why do we?
- Has a fantastic personality. Of that.

969
01:01:51.863 --> 01:01:54.357
- Who is speaking?
- Are crucial ...

970
01:01:55.155 --> 01:01:59.347
Lieutenant Sosa. Lynch agent talk?
Sorry, I do not know the second name.

971
01:01:59.446 --> 01:02:02.640
Neither do I.
How may I help Mrs lieutenant?

972
01:02:03.039 --> 01:02:07.131
I looked at a picture with you in prison
disciplinary Fort Carson.

973
01:02:08.928 --> 01:02:09.726
It's sexy.

974
01:02:09.826 --> 01:02:12.520
Have you visited the former colonel
Hannibal Smith in prison.

975
01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:19.506
I do not know what talking
Mrs. former captain.

976
01:02:19.705 --> 01:02:22.400
Agent <i> Mr Lynch
Smith's escape easier if you </ i>

977
01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:24.496
and help him now ...

978
01:02:28.388 --> 01:02:32.978
If you can prove something, your next
promotion should have five stars.

979
01:02:33.078 --> 01:02:35.872
And if you help recover
the matrix,

980
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:38.765
<i> will have to take out my way, </ i>

981
01:02:39.165 --> 01:02:40.263
<i> to disappoint you. </ i>

982
01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:51.639
I want to be tracked,
pursued her computer,

983
01:02:51.739 --> 01:02:54.534
any support is, I want to know everything.

984
01:02:54.634 --> 01:02:56.629
I want to be sniffing anything,

985
01:02:56.729 --> 01:02:58.626
I want to be monitored
any movement from this point.

986
01:02:58.726 --> 01:03:00.223
Realize that part
Department of Defense?

987
01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:04.114
I do not care if God no.
Do it.

988
01:03:05.611 --> 01:03:07.507
Head, look at that.

989
01:03:07.906 --> 01:03:11.299
I found this photo
Pike Konings his bank in Frankfurt.

990
01:03:11.699 --> 01:03:13.695
Those who saw him watching
him with an unknown Arab

991
01:03:13.795 --> 01:03:17.287
making regular road from the station to the bank
all in the last month.

992
01:03:18.085 --> 01:03:19.383
Pike becomes careless.

993
01:03:19.483 --> 01:03:21.279
Yes, but are likely
that Smith and his team

994
01:03:21.378 --> 01:03:22.576
to pursue them and they Pike and Arab?

995
01:03:22.775 --> 01:03:25.571
No, no, no, these are taken directly
Pentagon database.

996
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:28.365
It is absolutely impossible that Smith
and his team have that.

997
01:03:28.564 --> 01:03:31.957
I suppose I should have
more information than us all the time.

998
01:03:32.955 --> 01:03:37.645
Pike moved plates stolen from the bank Konings
in Frankfurt last month.

999
01:03:37.944 --> 01:03:42.035
Tomorrow, the last boxes containing
These boards will be transferred to the Arabs.

1000
01:03:42.834 --> 01:03:44.930
Will be the only time in the last six months

1001
01:03:45.030 --> 01:03:46.826
all boards
will be in one place.

1002
01:03:47.525 --> 01:03:49.720
Is the single best chance
ours to recover them.

1003
01:03:50.119 --> 01:03:53.313
Konings bank leaves
The 7:15 train to Zurich.

1004
01:03:54.211 --> 01:03:58.503
Lord, make sure
or not to take that train.

1005
01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:00.699
- It.
- Yes.

1006
01:04:00.798 --> 01:04:02.694
It's time to bring your former love.

1007
01:04:03.093 --> 01:04:04.191
If so good as I think

1008
01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:06.885
will be on the road to Frankfurt
to intercept these boards.

1009
01:04:09.980 --> 01:04:12.474
- Why did you tell her?
- Is a crusader.

1010
01:04:12.774 --> 01:04:15.767
- A need to have this at a time.
- Be careful around.

1011
01:04:15.968 --> 01:04:20.159
Sosa <i> agent, you have a phone.
Agent Sosa ...</ i>

1012
01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:22.055
Now it is more difficult.

1013
01:04:22.953 --> 01:04:26.246
If Sosa our aims must
Lynch suppose that one pursues it.

1014
01:04:28.342 --> 01:04:30.538
If you believe that it stays
between him and those boards,

1015
01:04:31.336 --> 01:04:32.733
will not hesitate to kill.

1 016
01:04:33.332 --> 01:04:35.527
Do, go to the station.

1017
01:04:38.122 --> 01:04:39.120
Are Sosa.

1018
01:04:40.916 --> 01:04:42.911
If there is a threat
Lynch's part, solved.

1019
01:04:43.311 --> 01:04:44.209
Hello?

1020
01:04:45.306 --> 01:04:47.601
<i> have permission to shoot. Again, you shoot. </ I>

1021
01:04:48.999 --> 01:04:49.997
Hello?

1022
01:04:56.483 --> 01:04:57.880
Something is wrong.

1023
01:05:00.675 --> 01:05:03.569
Retreat, guys.
I hate all that.

1024
01:05:03.869 --> 01:05:05.665
To see but not be seen.

1025
01:05:09.557 --> 01:05:12.151
- Hello, Agent Sosa.
- Have the guts to call me.

1026
01:05:12.251 --> 01:05:13.947
<i> had.
Was the only way to talk to you. </ I>

1027
01:05:14.147 --> 01:05:15.544
Lynch <i> you intercept all communications. </ i>

1028
01:05:15.843 --> 01:05:17.440
<i> team I want to retire now. </ i>

1029
01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.937
I will find you, Is.

1030
01:05:19.136 --> 01:05:21.633
No contact with her
or else directly.

1031
01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:22.830
Not if you find me first.

1032
01:05:30.314 --> 01:05:31.312
Come on.

1033
01:05:31.412 --> 01:05:32.810
Let me put handcuffs ...

1034
01:05:36.003 --> 01:05:37.400
Jesus!

1035
01:05:38.399 --> 01:05:40.794
- What are you doing?
- Trying to save you.

1036
01:05:44.885 --> 01:05:48.577
Charisse ... Come on, you know that we are innocent.

1037
01:05:49.276 --> 01:05:51.072
- You know that.
- Lying.

1038
01:05:51.571 --> 01:05:54.266
- As you lie in Baghdad.
- I knew

1039
01:05:54.366 --> 01:05:58.058
I knew nothing dies ... then.

1040
01:05:58.557 --> 01:06:00.752
You are a great liar!

1041
01:06:01.052 --> 01:06:03.846
Will you stop saying that? Thou hast lied!

1042
01:06:04.045 --> 01:06:04.944
- You are the one who lied ...
- When?

1043
01:06:05.044 --> 01:06:07.040
- Come on, you want to talk about this?
- Yes, to talk.

1044
01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:08.836
Did you know that I play, you wanted to play.

1045
01:06:09.036 --> 01:06:10.832
I became serious, and you've panicked.

1046
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:12.728
- I had panic? I did not panic.
- Yes.

1047
01:06:12.763 --> 01:06:14.324
- I did not panic.
- You panic.

1048
01:06:15.123 --> 01:06:16.719
And you ran.

1049
01:06:22.906 --> 01:06:24.504
Charisse, come ...

1050
01:06:24.703 --> 01:06:27.397
I am a federal fugitive.
You know exactly what you are.

1051
01:06:27.497 --> 01:06:30.092
You think I came to Frankfurt
paragraph to my old love problems?

1052
01:06:30.191 --> 01:06:30.990
No!

1053
01:06:31.689 --> 01:06:33.186
I came here
because we have not done that.

1054
01:06:33.386 --> 01:06:34.683
I came here
because we have staged it.

1055
01:06:34.882 --> 01:06:38.077
I came because
to follow the truth worth the risk.

1056
01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:45.461
And I believe in you
even if you do not believe me.

1057
01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:50.550
God, I had forgotten how beautiful you are.

1058
01:06:56.538 --> 01:06:59.432
Be careful on the phone.

1059
01:07:10.110 --> 01:07:11.208
Get him <i> guy </ i>

1060
01:07:11.407 --> 01:07:13.802
<i> guy fired! That guy shot </ i>

1061
01:07:15.698 --> 01:07:16.596
Fool!

1062
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:21.586
Damn. Where is Peck?

1063
01:07:21.885 --> 01:07:23.781
I have a few questions. Find it!

1064
01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.938
All right. To "dance".

1065
01:08:34.138 --> 01:08:36.433
Descend. Everyone is in position.
Ready to go.

1066
01:08:37.630 --> 01:08:38.928
Always stay close to me, sir.

1067
01:09:02.779 --> 01:09:04.076
How are you doing, big guy?

1068
01:09:04.375 --> 01:09:06.736
Murdock comes Arabs.

1069
01:09:06.771 --> 01:09:09.266
<i> is a throw into center field. </ i>

1070
01:09:09.465 --> 01:09:13.159
<i> Murdoch returns and manages to catch </ i>

<i> B.A., I dropped the case. </ i>

1072

<i> Pull me. I left here </ i>

1073
01:09:49.384 --> 01:09:50.682
B.A., take those cards!

1074
01:10:43.771 --> 01:10:46.765
Police responded to a call of an explosion
and gunshots in the building Konings.

1075
01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:49.160
Well, take us to that building
as fast as you can.

1076
01:10:49.259 --> 01:10:50.656
Yes, madame.

1077
01:11:08.221 --> 01:11:09.518
You made me something to work, Baracus.

1078
01:11:10.716 --> 01:11:15.207
Not thought to be in a physical form
so good. Fortunately, there are.

1079
01:11:15.707 --> 01:11:19.200
Where is the rest of the team? Smith? Peck?

1080
01:11:19.399 --> 01:11:21.395
That idiot pilot, which is his name?

1081
01:11:28.281 --> 01:11:30.676
I will force you out information, Baracus.
Let's see what you know.

1082
01:11:35.067 --> 01:11:37.162
Come ... What are you doing? Are you tired?

1083
01:11:37.262 --> 01:11:38.360
Not to hurt you, man.

1084
01:11:38.459 --> 01:11:39.856
No, I hurt you,
I will hurt you.

1085
01:11:45.944 --> 01:11:48.439
- I do not want to kill you, man.
- Do not want to kill me? Do not kill me.

1086
01:11:48.539 --> 01:11:49.537
You kill me, Baracus.

1087
01:11:49.637 --> 01:11:50.834
Do not play your game, Pike.

1088
01:11:50.934 --> 01:11:53.528
You do, because I
two left arms here, remember, right?

1089
01:11:53.927 --> 01:11:56.123
So as soon as
one to lie down arms after a start.

1090
01:11:56.223 --> 01:11:58.918
- I swear he would do.
- Not a coward, right?

1091
01:12:00.614 --> 01:12:01.911
No?

1092
01:12:07.499 --> 01:12:09.495
- Damn!
- You need a car, big guy?

1093
01:12:09.595 --> 01:12:11.192
You saved my life, man.
I could not shoot him.

1094
01:12:18.976 --> 01:12:21.670
Move!
Down! Down!

1095
01:12:38.935 --> 01:12:42.129
<i> Police! Hands up! </ I>

1096
01:12:52.508 --> 01:12:55.003
Yes ... so, are the police.

1097
01:12:55.402 --> 01:12:58.196
That is funny.
You are lucky that people around.

1098
01:12:58.695 --> 01:13:01.191
No, baby. You are lucky.

1099
01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.376
Okay, we have the Arab.

1100
01:13:08.974 --> 01:13:10.371
Sosa was at the station.

1101
01:13:10.870 --> 01:13:12.567
- Have you seen it?
- Yes.

1102
01:13:13.265 --> 01:13:16.159
- Did you talk to her?
- I had no choice, right?

1103
01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.055
- Trust me with this.
- I trust you ...

1104
01:13:18.454 --> 01:13:21.248
to make a bad decision.

1105
01:13:21.647 --> 01:13:23.844
What body part you think?

1106
01:13:23.943 --> 01:13:25.939
A Lynch's men attacked.
He had to react.

1107
01:13:26.238 --> 01:13:29.132
Please ...
Somehow I doubt it.

1108
01:13:29.232 --> 01:13:30.928
Hey, why are you angry?

1109
01:13:31.028 --> 01:13:33.723
We matrices.
You wanted to be busy, occupied.

1110
01:13:34.422 --> 01:13:35.619
I know that not stolen in November.

1111
01:13:37.216 --> 01:13:38.913
Will be pleased to know that we stole.

1112
01:13:41.308 --> 01:13:42.506
What?

1113
01:13:43.104 --> 01:13:44.302
Need to know.

1114
01:13:46.996 --> 01:13:48.393
Need to know.

1115
01:13:50.588 --> 01:13:53.482
You should know that
if I leave this life will follow.

1116
01:13:59.770 --> 01:14:01.666
How come you know?

1117
01:14:05.558 --> 01:14:09.051
Then you know who is he?

1118
01:14:17.533 --> 01:14:18.930
We all know.

1119
01:14:22.722 --> 01:14:23.919
Morrison?

1120
01:14:24.618 --> 01:14:25.715
Hell, no ...

1121
01:14:26.814 --> 01:14:28.111
Jesus.

1122
01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:33.401
I'm sure is a blessing.
Goodbye, friend.

1123
01:14:36.095 --> 01:14:38.791
- Thanks.
- Fucking hell!

1124
01:14:45.476 --> 01:14:47.771
Morrison?
Damn.

1125
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:49.569
Out.

1126
01:14:51.365 --> 01:14:52.662
Everyone. Out now.

1127
01:14:54.658 --> 01:14:59.848
When Lynch helped me to escape,
have been involved.

1128
01:15:01.245 --> 01:15:03.739
You wanted Pike to make a plan
for those with Lynch plates.

1129
01:15:04.338 --> 01:15:05.336
And you turned against him.

1130
01:15:06.234 --> 01:15:07.731
Just as you turned against us.

1131
01:15:07.930 --> 01:15:09.728
Lynch did not want to receive us in business.

1132
01:15:12.522 --> 01:15:13.919
He used us.

1133
01:15:15.016 --> 01:15:16.613
You brought it on insurance.

1134
01:15:17.511 --> 01:15:20.804
Was not thought
that you betray an old friend.

1135
01:15:21.502 --> 01:15:24.296
I just hit first, Hannibal.
I am a fighter.

1136
01:15:24.496 --> 01:15:26.292
You are a liar and a traitor!

1137
01:15:28.188 --> 01:15:31.083
Morrison knew that disguised
in Arabic. Why do not you tell me?

1138
01:15:31.183 --> 01:15:33.677
- I was not 100% sure.
- But 99%?

1139
01:15:34.376 --> 01:15:38.866
Did they deserve?
I mean, you think?

1140
01:15:39.265 --> 01:15:40.763
<i> As a place to kill </ i>

1141
01:15:40.963 --> 01:15:41.961
I was sure of it.

1142
01:15:42.260 --> 01:15:44.356
Still are. Of cards?

1143
01:15:45.154 --> 01:15:49.445
- I would not be called if I had not.
- Smith returned the plates,

1144
01:15:49.744 --> 01:15:51.840
Morrison kill him
and regains your life.

1145
01:15:52.239 --> 01:15:57.128
I want an amnesty for understanding
me and for each of my men

1146
01:15:57.527 --> 01:16:01.021
signed by the White House
The Head of State.

1147
01:16:01.720 --> 01:16:02.818
Did you hear?

1148
01:16:05.812 --> 01:16:08.905
- I need a little more time.
- How long?

1149
01:16:15.592 --> 01:16:17.988
- Give me five minutes.
- Look.

1150
01:16:22.578 --> 01:16:25.771
<i> - You cards?
- I would not be called if I had not. </ I>

1151
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:31.559
<i> Smith returned the plates, kill him
Morrison and regains your life. </ i>

1152
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.146
I saw his funeral.

1153
01:16:39.643 --> 01:16:41.938
You died a national hero.

1154
01:16:54.512 --> 01:16:55.909
Death is too easy.

1155
01:16:56.408 --> 01:16:58.902
Last thing
we need now is another lie.

1156
01:16:59.002 --> 01:17:01.796
Do not do this, Hannibal, please.
You owe me that.

1157
01:17:01.996 --> 01:17:03.892
I you owe you!

1158
01:17:04.391 --> 01:17:05.888
You tell them that we are innocent.

1159
01:17:11.078 --> 01:17:16.069
Hannibal is useless! What
May you and your boys fight now?

1160
01:17:16.169 --> 01:17:18.663
For grade, for reputation?

1161
01:17:18.763 --> 01:17:20.160
Means nothing!

1162
01:17:20.659 --> 01:17:25.549
You are condemned.
With or without plates, are federal fugitives.

1163
01:17:25.948 --> 01:17:29.241
And when they will finish with you,
Hannibal, or hold them.

1164
01:17:30.139 --> 01:17:33.931
Zulu 1 Zulu 1, are Broadsword.
You have permission to attack.

1165
01:17:34.230 --> 01:17:36.126
- "Broadsword", you invented it?
- Yes.

1166
01:17:36.425 --> 01:17:37.423
It is a great time.

1167
01:17:42.813 --> 01:17:44.310
You could do this?

1168
01:17:47.303 --> 01:17:50.198
Nine. What did Morrison.

1169
01:17:50.597 --> 01:17:54.389
No! I prefer to sit in front of platoon
execution than betray you, guys.

1170
01:17:55.786 --> 01:17:58.480
- Yes, but you have provided it.
- No.

1171
01:18:02.272 --> 01:18:03.370
I never realized it would follow that.

1172
01:18:08.959 --> 01:18:10.057
Run!

1173
01:18:23.631 --> 01:18:26.624
It's great. Look exactly
as in "Call of Duty", eh?

1174
01:18:27.223 --> 01:18:28.385
Okay, forget what.

1175
01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:31.214
No press statements and keep away
Press this place and local police.

1176
01:18:31.414 --> 01:18:33.609
Within a radius of five kilometers.
Prohibited flight area.

1177
01:18:34.108 --> 01:18:38.299
Send an e-mail agency, we need
plates of those goddamn back.

1178
01:18:39.796 --> 01:18:43.988
German police detained his whole team
for entering the Tower Konings.

1179
01:18:45.784 --> 01:18:47.680
Not working with teams, is Smith's team.

1180
01:18:48.379 --> 01:18:49.676
Only one act.

1181
01:18:58.159 --> 01:18:59.456
I like traveling alone.

1182
01:19:00.354 --> 01:19:04.745
It seems that loyalty no longer exists.

1183
01:19:06.142 --> 01:19:07.738
Smith thought you and work together.

1184
01:19:09.435 --> 01:19:10.333
You cheated.

1185
01:19:11.031 --> 01:19:13.526
Yes, we have weapons. No, we can retain them.

1186
01:19:16.022 --> 01:19:18.117
Want to make a deal?
I propose one.

1187
01:19:19.115 --> 01:19:23.007
How about to dedicate my near future ...

1188
01:19:24.006 --> 01:19:25.403
to destroy it yours?

1189
01:19:26.201 --> 01:19:29.594
How about to be clever
and begin to negotiate?

1190
01:19:30.691 --> 01:19:31.989
Before someone else to do it.

1191
01:19:34.684 --> 01:19:35.782
Lady was captain ...

1192
01:19:37.678 --> 01:19:40.272
If you have a paper
which looks exactly like this

1193
01:19:40.472 --> 01:19:43.266
then this young troubled mine.

1194
01:19:43.465 --> 01:19:44.563
Let's go.

1195
01:19:45.361 --> 01:19:46.858
How the hell they got
of an extradition order?

1196
01:19:47.357 --> 01:19:49.853
Sorry, Pike.
At least with me there were rules.

1197
01:19:49.952 --> 01:19:53.047
The CIA has rules. Just my
are stronger than yours.

1198
01:19:53.845 --> 01:19:54.743
Go.

1199
01:19:54.843 --> 01:19:57.139
You know, Lynch, if I could seal
with you in this room,

1200
01:19:57.239 --> 01:19:58.736
I make the world a great service.

1201
01:19:59.734 --> 01:20:00.532
It was not nice.

1202
01:20:00.931 --> 01:20:01.729
Lynch!

1203
01:20:04.623 --> 01:20:05.920
Stay near the fire, boys.

1204
01:20:06.519 --> 01:20:09.413
If that plane remained in the area
we can read the temperature of bodies.

1205
01:20:10.012 --> 01:20:14.003
Lynch is an idiot. He wanted
to kill us, although we knew that the cards.

1206
01:20:14.602 --> 01:20:16.797
Why not think one day unhappy?

1207
01:20:17.096 --> 01:20:18.693
Are you mad? You should be!

1208
01:20:19.292 --> 01:20:22.087
Who the hell cares plates? Morrison was
who alone can prove his innocence.

1209
01:20:22.286 --> 01:20:23.883
Without Morrison, we have nothing.

1210
01:20:26.178 --> 01:20:27.975
- What we gonna do, boss?
- DK, Murdock.

1211
01:20:29.272 --> 01:20:30.669
- Do not know.
- I know.

1212
01:20:32.965 --> 01:20:36.258
Lynch guy ... I think
I realized that follows.

1213
01:20:36.557 --> 01:20:38.652
- Have a plan, kid?
- How do we go from here?

1214
01:20:40.449 --> 01:20:41.646
Give me 20 minutes.

1215
01:20:46.436 --> 01:20:50.926
The dead Morrison, Smith and his team
dead in about 15 minutes

1216
01:20:51.325 --> 01:20:52.723
one to locate those matrices.

1217
01:20:52.923 --> 01:20:55.218
- What is it? You happy?
- Yes, I defeated.

1218
01:20:56.216 --> 01:20:58.810
After me wrong.
We had a deal, remember?

1219
01:20:59.010 --> 01:20:59.809
Not us.

1220
01:20:59.909 --> 01:21:01.705
- You, me and Morrison.
- November 2 Not directly.

1221
01:21:01.740 --> 01:21:03.002
And you two have conspired to exclude me?

1222
01:21:06.395 --> 01:21:09.489
- What are you doing? In the car?
- I do it in the car?

1223
01:21:09.524 --> 01:21:11.085
- I do this?
- I do it?

1224
01:21:11.484 --> 01:21:13.081
Bravo. It's brilliant.

1225
01:21:13.979 --> 01:21:15.176
What are you doing? What?

1226
01:21:15.675 --> 01:21:17.671
- Jesus.
- How's Kyle? Are you okay?

1227
01:21:18.569 --> 01:21:20.765
- I'm fine.
- Dude, you are far from well.

1228
01:21:21.064 --> 01:21:21.962
What are you doing?

1229
01:21:22.062 --> 01:21:23.959
- There is ...
- It's a shock.

1230
01:21:24.158 --> 01:21:26.354
It is a mute.
Screw in a clockwise direction.

1231
01:21:26.653 --> 01:21:28.549
Have you ever had such a weapon?
Have you ever held a gun in his hand like this?

1232
01:21:28.749 --> 01:21:29.946
It's amazing.

1233
01:21:31.343 --> 01:21:33.539
Can I make a last request? Do not leave
this guy to shoot me, please.

1234
01:21:40.625 --> 01:21:44.217
- If Sosa thinks that we are alive ...
- We believe that Morrison is alive.

1235
01:21:45.016 --> 01:21:47.311
Let's hope yet Lynch
Sosa's conversations intercepted them.

1236
01:21:50.903 --> 01:21:52.400
Are Sosa.

1237
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:54.396
General <i> Morrison is in my possession. </ i>

1238
01:21:55.594 --> 01:21:58.389
What? Sorry.
I can not hear. Who is?

1239
01:21:59.387 --> 01:22:01.383
- Okay, this was not thought out well.
- Really?

1240
01:22:01.682 --> 01:22:03.478
I mean, look, you must learn
how to kill me?

1241
01:22:03.779 --> 01:22:06.573
Do me a favor, OK?
Put the gun barrel near my head ...

1242
01:22:06.772 --> 01:22:08.070
- Are you sure?
- Yes, right there ...

1243
01:22:08.469 --> 01:22:10.265
Do not shoot someone else and
except me ...

1244
01:22:12.061 --> 01:22:13.358
- Look ...
- We are usually right.

1245
01:22:14.356 --> 01:22:16.851
Do not ever put handcuffs
a man who has his hands behind his back.

1246
01:22:17.050 --> 01:22:18.747
That makes it can see the hands.

1247
01:22:18.946 --> 01:22:21.241
- That was great.
- Did you like that?

1248
01:22:21.641 --> 01:22:23.537
I liked it. I liked a lot.

1249
01:22:23.836 --> 01:22:26.530
- You okay, asshole?
- Yeah, right.

1250
01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:27.827
Please put them handcuffs.

1251
01:22:28.427 --> 01:22:30.423
No need to ask again.
We do not need handcuffs.

1252
01:22:30.523 --> 01:22:31.521
Who's talking?

1253
01:22:32.119 --> 01:22:34.065
- Pistolarule by phone.
- Jesus.

1254
01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:36.012
- What?
- Hey, hey! Put the gun down.

1255
01:22:36.411 --> 01:22:38.706
Hey, you have robbed me.
Morrison did.

1256
01:22:39.006 --> 01:22:41.001
- I really want to shoot you.
- You hear that, sir.

1257
01:22:42.299 --> 01:22:46.090
<i> - Are you Smith?
- A former colonel by a former captain. </ I>

1258
01:22:46.589 --> 01:22:50.082
We have about 30 seconds <i>
to locate the signal, so listen ...</ i>

1259
01:22:50.481 --> 01:22:52.277
<i> We have evidence that we are innocent. </ i>

1260
01:22:52.976 --> 01:22:54.772
Okay, well, give back ...

1261
01:22:54.971 --> 01:22:57.366
You said it's on Morrison
General Morrison?

1262
01:22:57.765 --> 01:22:59.761
- Right.
- Is he alive?

1263
01:22:59.961 --> 01:23:03.255
<i> and healthy. Lynch tried to kill us. </ I>

1264
01:23:03.953 --> 01:23:05.450
Is too long to explain now

1265
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:08.845
Morrison's testimony but
blocked us from Lynch's order.

1266
01:23:12.936 --> 01:23:16.030
- Where are the plates?
- Also in my possession.

1267
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:20.221
Remember, Lynch believed to be dead.
I want to remain so.

1268
01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:22.316
- Give me a pen. A pen?
- Okay, when and where?

1269
01:23:22.516 --> 01:23:23.614
- A pen?
- I.

1270
01:23:23.714 --> 01:23:26.109
- Want to use a pen?
- At sunrise.

1271
01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:28.304
<i> I give it to you on a tray Morrison </ i>

1272
01:23:29.202 --> 01:23:32.896
and instead want a different process
before a civil court.

1273
01:23:33.394 --> 01:23:35.290
Okay, we had a deal.

1274
01:23:36.288 --> 01:23:40.181
The docks Los Angeles
over 48 hours. Any other lies ...

1275
01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.778
and understanding is no longer valid.

1276
01:23:44.572 --> 01:23:46.468
- I located?
- No.

1277
01:23:49.461 --> 01:23:52.555
Pike, believe in second chance?

1278
01:23:55.448 --> 01:23:56.346
Now think.

1279
01:23:57.045 --> 01:24:00.039
- It was too much?
- It was exactly as it should.

1280
01:24:02.833 --> 01:24:03.631
It's my turn.

1281
01:24:14.210 --> 01:24:15.308
Be careful on the phone.

1282
01:24:24.190 --> 01:24:26.385
- Are Sosa.
- Hello, beautiful.

1283
01:24:27.483 --> 01:24:28.481
Thank you.

1284
01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:41.055
Look at B.A., looks like a giant banana.

1285
01:24:43.151 --> 01:24:44.349
- Good morning, my friend.
- Good morning.

1286
01:24:49.837 --> 01:24:51.434
Rufay Pinkyou Denowich?

1287
01:24:55.026 --> 01:24:56.089
What was your passport?

1288
01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:58.319
You are in Tanzania?
My mother is from Tanzania.

1289
01:24:58.818 --> 01:25:00.514
- Shit.
- It happens.

1290
01:25:00.714 --> 01:25:01.812
Who is Ali Wababba?

1291
01:25:13.090 --> 01:25:15.285
Be prepared to intervene.
There are three in my right.

1 292
01:25:15.385 --> 01:25:16.982
Behind me are two
and yet one more thing.

1293
01:25:21.972 --> 01:25:22.870
Wait a minute ...

1294
01:25:31.752 --> 01:25:33.249
Murdock speaks.

1295
01:25:38.936 --> 01:25:40.533
- You tanzaneza?
- You do not?

1296
01:25:42.131 --> 01:25:44.526
- You have enough things, kid?
- Well ...

1297
01:25:44.725 --> 01:25:47.720
We have some tools
Atlantic crossing.

1298
01:25:48.219 --> 01:25:50.614
I was told that there are
only on the black market.

1299
01:25:51.013 --> 01:25:52.011
How to get there?

1300
01:25:53.008 --> 01:25:55.204
No planes, no boats, Murdock,
I talked about it.

1301
01:25:55.603 --> 01:25:57.100
Jesus!

1302
01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:00.093
I can travel with this.
Not safe!

1303
01:26:00.393 --> 01:26:04.185
Yes, you know I told you that one day
one to make you overcome your fear.

1304
01:26:04.584 --> 01:26:05.781
What?

1305
01:26:07.378 --> 01:26:08.875
Hey, this is not ...

1306
01:26:10.371 --> 01:26:11.369
Just not today.

1307
01:26:12.766 --> 01:26:14.529
Murdock, do not you remember what I said?

1308
01:26:14.563 --> 01:26:17.557
- I said get him after you inject.
- You get him after you inject.

1309
01:26:20.751 --> 01:26:21.849
My bad.

1310
01:26:47.895 --> 01:26:50.889
Damn! My head!

1311
01:26:54.682 --> 01:26:56.678
- Your favorite food.
- Give me that, Murdock.

1312
01:26:58.375 --> 01:27:00.969
- You and Toss Point?
- Voila.

1313
01:27:01.967 --> 01:27:02.965
Toss Point.

1314
01:27:05.160 --> 01:27:06.258
You left me unconscious again, right?

1315
01:27:07.256 --> 01:27:11.048
Welcome ... injection thing
and your leaving the unconscious ...

1316
01:27:11.746 --> 01:27:13.343
Hannibal and Face.

1317
01:27:13.742 --> 01:27:16.137
Your favorite food ... Murdock.

1318
01:27:16.736 --> 01:27:18.134
Why do I feel like I fell in front?

1319
01:27:20.628 --> 01:27:21.427
Tell me that.

1320
01:27:25.519 --> 01:27:27.814
Lynch is a paradox.
Murdock, do this?

1321
01:27:28.812 --> 01:27:33.402
That is the guy who has loved
anonymous, but loves drama.

1322
01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.595
Ese an administrator, not the operator.

1323
01:27:40.088 --> 01:27:44.079
Where is it?
Very good.

1324
01:27:45.177 --> 01:27:48.171
So his face is very
far from the impact location

1325
01:27:48.270 --> 01:27:50.368
and never dirty their hands
if you can.

1326
01:27:50.468 --> 01:27:51.765
One to change all that.

1327
01:27:52.164 --> 01:27:53.362
You can not cheat an underachiever.

1328
01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.751
No explosion, no flame
even a spark.

1329
01:27:58.786 --> 01:27:59.849
That is the beauty sweeps substance.

1330
01:27:59.949 --> 01:28:01.246
Softly, softly.

1331
01:28:02.443 --> 01:28:04.439
This guy has never attracted
his attention.

1332
01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:10.127
He always pulled the strings from elsewhere,
where was safe.

1333
01:28:12.123 --> 01:28:13.520
<i> mother. </ i>

1334
01:28:13.719 --> 01:28:15.615
Boss, why are so many things?

1335
01:28:16.014 --> 01:28:18.808
For that killed
is overrated, man.

1336
01:28:20.904 --> 01:28:23.300
So bring it on one guy
action instead.

1337
01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:27.691
<i> mother ...
Lynch </ i>

1338
01:28:28.789 --> 01:28:30.585
In the last place they want to be.

1339
01:28:33.479 --> 01:28:36.772
And one to film
the whole world could see it.

1340
01:28:38.269 --> 01:28:39.366
Do you have any questions?

1341
01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.055
- What is man?
- I will be okay.

1342
01:28:45.854 --> 01:28:46.851
It will be difficult, eh?

1343
01:28:49.346 --> 01:28:51.641
Well, I can not promise that you will not.

1344
01:28:52.938 --> 01:28:54.037
I read something ...

1345
01:28:55.035 --> 01:28:58.827
Victory by violence
is equivalent to a defeat.

1346
01:29:00.025 --> 01:29:01.423
For it is only for now.

1347
01:29:03.319 --> 01:29:04.417
Gandhi.

1348
01:29:05.315 --> 01:29:08.408
It is better to be violent
if there is violence in my heart,

1349
01:29:09.207 --> 01:29:12.500
Just take your mask nonviolence
to cover your impotence.

1350
01:29:14.895 --> 01:29:17.689
- Who said that?
- The same.

1351
01:29:19.086 --> 01:29:21.979
Gandhi was not afraid to fight
for what they believe.

1352
01:29:23.177 --> 01:29:25.272
What you think, B.A.?

1353
01:29:47.726 --> 01:29:48.625
What happened?

1354
01:29:49.622 --> 01:29:51.518
I have to think about it ...

1355
01:29:52.217 --> 01:29:53.614
This is ... no.

1356
01:29:54.412 --> 01:29:56.109
We always came back alive.

1357
01:29:56.508 --> 01:30:00.400
- All four, because of old.
- I know.

1358
01:30:00.435 --> 01:30:02.596
- I'm not him.
- Do I know that.

1359
01:30:02.695 --> 01:30:04.792
Murdock, Hannibal I'm not.

1360
01:30:06.588 --> 01:30:08.883
Who has the most to lose
of this, Face?

1361
01:30:09.582 --> 01:30:10.580
Eu.

1362
01:30:12.377 --> 01:30:13.474
And I trust you.

1363
01:30:15.570 --> 01:30:17.167
Yes, I know, Murdock.

1364
01:30:18.963 --> 01:30:19.961
You're crazy.

1365
01:30:24.651 --> 01:30:25.649
Not so crazy.

1366
01:30:43.314 --> 01:30:44.811
<i> our Eagles seem to have landed. </ i>

1367
01:30:45.010 --> 01:30:47.305

Okay, guys. You all ready?

1370
01:30:59.479 --> 01:31:00.876
Let's see.

1371
01:31:02.973 --> 01:31:04.270
Showtime.

1372
01:31:09.859 --> 01:31:11.256
Take it there on Smith. Watch it.

1373
01:31:12.953 --> 01:31:14.250
<i> ground team is in position </ i>

1374
01:31:15.148 --> 01:31:16.046
<i> waiting. </ i>

1375
01:31:18.141 --> 01:31:19.040
We are in position.

1376
01:31:21.335 --> 01:31:22.632
So a team of snipers.

1377
01:31:25.426 --> 01:31:28.619
Talks to supervise
time. Morrison is the main target.

1378
01:31:28.819 --> 01:31:30.016
Cards will come with it.

1379
01:31:32.012 --> 01:31:32.910
Yes?

1380
01:31:33.509 --> 01:31:36.104
<i> right, speaks with Sosa.
I want to hear you talk. </ I>

1381
01:31:36.204 --> 01:31:38.100
You lied, Sosa, I had an understanding.

1382
01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.097
Damn I want to hear the conversation ...
Thank you.

1383
01:31:40.196 --> 01:31:42.192
<i> I had an understanding, but an exchange. </ i>

1384
01:31:42.491 --> 01:31:45.685

- This is a complicated exchange. </ I>

1385
01:31:45.784 --> 01:31:47.082
<i> not you like it here. </ i>

1386
01:31:47.281 --> 01:31:50.674
<i> listen, or continue to remain a fugitive. </ i>

1387
01:31:50.874 --> 01:31:52.570
- No, no ...
- To God ...

1388
01:31:52.670 --> 01:31:55.963
I have here on Morrison and plates.
Are exposed, Sosa! Exposed!

1389
01:31:56.462 --> 01:31:59.755
- Do not do it on the docks.
- Listen, we do not teach.

1390
01:31:59.854 --> 01:32:02.214
Listen, we do not teach.

1391
01:32:02.249 --> 01:32:04.445
<i> must do
in my terms, if at all. </ i>

1392
01:32:04.544 --> 01:32:06.241
<i> Damn it! Damn you, Sosa </ i>

1393
01:32:06.741 --> 01:32:08.138
- Yes, and you hit it.
- Thanks.

1394
01:32:08.238 --> 01:32:11.432
B.A., go. Sosa cheated us.
Murdock ...

1395
01:32:12.529 --> 01:32:13.926
Come here in 10 minutes by helicopter.

1396
01:32:16.221 --> 01:32:18.218
Okay, moving.
You see? Moves.

1397
01:32:18.418 --> 01:32:19.915
For God, relax.

1398
01:32:20.513 --> 01:32:22.010
<i> are relaxed. Moving. </ I>

1399
01:32:22.409 --> 01:32:25.802
- Do not do this, Hannibal, please.
- That is Morrison. Shot him.

1400
01:32:26.002 --> 01:32:28.696
- Does the plates?
- Smith has plates. Pull out now.

1401
01:32:28.796 --> 01:32:30.292
- I got the viewfinder Morrison.
- Shoot now.

1402
01:32:33.685 --> 01:32:35.582
<i> little too close, kid. </ i>

1403
01:32:36.380 --> 01:32:38.976

- What are you doing?

1404
01:32:39.375 --> 01:32:42.668
<i> Where am I? Someone to tell me.
I smashed the thing </ i>

1405
01:32:44.465 --> 01:32:47.259
It was much easier
when there were three plastic cups.

1406
01:32:51.151 --> 01:32:53.945
Everyone is calm and attentive.

1407
01:32:55.841 --> 01:32:59.333
You beat a guy like Lynch
doing three things.

1408
01:32:59.733 --> 01:33:02.028
- What are they doing?
- Distraction.

1409
01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:06.718
What is happening?

1410
01:33:09.412 --> 01:33:10.310
Diversion.

1411
01:33:15.301 --> 01:33:17.297
It is a diversion.
Be aware of those containers.

1412
01:33:18.395 --> 01:33:19.792
Heading for exit
open fire!

1413
01:33:20.191 --> 01:33:22.885
Do not attack! Back!
Do not attack!

1414
01:33:27.475 --> 01:33:28.373
God!

1415
01:33:32.964 --> 01:33:35.658
- Attack!
- You are deceived by Smith.

1416
01:33:35.858 --> 01:33:38.352
Try to distract your attention
Lynch. Come on, be smart.

1417
01:33:38.951 --> 01:33:39.949
Kill them, kill them, kill them!

1418
01:33:42.743 --> 01:33:44.540
Contact us! On the boat!

1419
01:33:44.839 --> 01:33:46.038
<i> will fire missiles </ i>

1420
01:33:52.725 --> 01:33:53.523
And division.

1421
01:33:55.519 --> 01:33:58.512
It's a trap!
Retreat! Retreat now!

1422
01:33:58.612 --> 01:33:59.710
No, no, no!

1423
01:34:01.705 --> 01:34:02.603
Get out of here!

1424
01:34:05.498 --> 01:34:07.893
What is happening? What happens?

1425
01:34:08.292 --> 01:34:09.190
Bravo, kid.

1426
01:34:09.689 --> 01:34:11.086
<i> is Baracus </ i>

1427
01:34:11.186 --> 01:34:12.683
- Shoot him!
- Shut up, I know I do.

1428
01:34:13.082 --> 01:34:15.478
OK, fans,
is time for professionals.

1429
01:34:18.472 --> 01:34:20.069
B.A., pass the secondary position.

1430
01:34:22.264 --> 01:34:26.356
Well, the game has changed.
Look what I think about your plan.

1431
01:34:33.540 --> 01:34:34.538
Jesus!

1432
01:34:35.037 --> 01:34:37.033
Went great trick, Smith.

1433
01:34:37.432 --> 01:34:38.430
What the hell was that?

1434
01:34:38.729 --> 01:34:42.022
- Do what the hell was that?
- Pike fired at us!

1435
01:34:42.222 --> 01:34:44.317
- He made a hole in the ship.
- What about the plan?

1436
01:34:44.717 --> 01:34:47.112
Pike just broke our plan.
We do not have any plans.

1437
01:34:47.412 --> 01:34:49.707
- Get out there!
- You lose Hannibal.

1438
01:34:51.005 --> 01:34:53.001
- Cover me, I go to get those cards.
- Yes, sir.

1439
01:34:57.392 --> 01:34:58.989
Murdock, get outta there!

1440
01:35:00.286 --> 01:35:01.384
Resist!

1441
01:36:42.975 --> 01:36:43.973
Jesus!

1442
01:36:47.466 --> 01:36:49.960
Murdock, Pike has a higher position.
Left without ammunition, man.

1443
01:37:02.635 --> 01:37:03.533
Shit!

1444
01:37:03.932 --> 01:37:04.930
How are you aratosule?

1445
01:37:06.227 --> 01:37:08.223
Kid, I must admit,
was a good job.

1446
01:37:08.622 --> 01:37:11.516
Friends are like bullets.
There are never where you need them.

1447
01:37:15.009 --> 01:37:16.506
Do not take it personally, but ...

1448
01:37:17.304 --> 01:37:20.398
Look here, smile ...
and expected flash.

1449
01:37:23.791 --> 01:37:24.789
Baracus!

1450
01:37:50.038 --> 01:37:51.235
Lynch ...

1451
01:37:54.429 --> 01:37:56.025
Lynch ...

1452
01:38:01.914 --> 01:38:03.312
Come on, Lynch.

1453
01:38:07.104 --> 01:38:08.201
Lynch ...

1454
01:38:10.496 --> 01:38:12.692
Come on, Smith, crap ending.

1455
01:38:13.390 --> 01:38:15.486
Lynch, come on, Lynch.

1456
01:38:19.976 --> 01:38:22.870
Lynch. Where am I?

1457
01:38:26.263 --> 01:38:27.560
Come on, Lynch.

1458
01:38:30.355 --> 01:38:33.350
Lynch ... where, Lynch?

1459
01:38:36.344 --> 01:38:38.639
Lynch, Lynch ...

1460
01:38:38.939 --> 01:38:40.835
Lynch, Lynch ...

1461
01:38:41.733 --> 01:38:43.229
Lynch!

1462
01:38:57.798 --> 01:38:58.696
There you are, Hannibal.

1463
01:38:59.395 --> 01:39:00.892
I looked everywhere.

1464
01:39:02.089 --> 01:39:03.386
Do not let that fool you scar.

1465
01:39:03.885 --> 01:39:05.483
I have a pretty good taste.

1466
01:39:06.181 --> 01:39:07.779
Yours was a little better, but ...

1467
01:39:08.378 --> 01:39:12.170
containers and the whole thing ...

1468
01:39:12.569 --> 01:39:14.016
and fireworks ...

1469
01:39:14.051 --> 01:39:15.463
Lynch Lynch Lynch ...

1470
01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:17.858
Gosh, that was annoying.

1471
01:39:18.756 --> 01:39:21.250
But if you give him Pike
a rocket launcher,

1472
01:39:22.548 --> 01:39:23.846
is your tool.

1473
01:39:25.143 --> 01:39:26.141
Hannibal does not do this.

1474
01:39:26.241 --> 01:39:29.933
You know, Smith, you can have
best recipe in the world ...

1475
01:39:30.332 --> 01:39:32.827
- You owe me that.
- But you have to shoot bullets in battle.

1476
01:39:32.861 --> 01:39:34.623
- Hannibal, do not do this.
- Lynch, no!

1477
01:39:39.015 --> 01:39:40.413
Otherwise do not bake that cake.

1478
01:39:41.611 --> 01:39:44.305
Your witness, your weapon ... your problem.

1479
01:39:47.798 --> 01:39:49.993
You've served the country well.
Excuse me.

1480
01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.475
Hey, Ben, where have you been all my life?

1481
01:40:01.169 --> 01:40:04.662
Hannibal, what are you doing, man?
Bleeding?

1482
01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:06.059
Bleeding?

1483
01:40:07.555 --> 01:40:08.654
Do not get up.

1484
01:40:15.141 --> 01:40:16.139
God!

1485
01:40:16.239 --> 01:40:17.237
Damn.

1486
01:40:21.927 --> 01:40:23.024
Remained the best weapon.

1487
01:40:23.823 --> 01:40:27.016
I have a loaded gun in his hand.
"You'll shoot a bullet in the head.

1488
01:40:42.484 --> 01:40:43.682
I told you that you shoot.

1489
01:40:45.977 --> 01:40:47.574
And Kevlar vest saved my life.

1490
01:40:47.973 --> 01:40:50.069
The thing is that he'll be
of no use if you shoot in the head.

1491
01:40:50.867 --> 01:40:52.465
Yes, if you finish.

1492
01:40:54.460 --> 01:40:56.955
Hannibal, please do not do this.
Hannibal, please.

1493
01:40:57.155 --> 01:40:59.949
See, beat a guy like him
if you do three things.

1494
01:41:00.847 --> 01:41:02.842
- Distracting.
- What is happening?

1495
01:41:03.142 --> 01:41:04.140
Diversion ...

1496
01:41:05.337 --> 01:41:06.435
And divide.

1497
01:41:10.327 --> 01:41:13.522
And he put on demand
the whole world to see.

1498
01:41:16.816 --> 01:41:17.614
What ...?

1499
01:41:32.083 --> 01:41:33.380
It's good.

1500
01:41:35.675 --> 01:41:36.873
Surprise!

1501
01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:41.563
- Agent Pars!
- What did you say?

1502
01:41:42.860 --> 01:41:44.556
Pars agent, is not it your name?

1503
01:41:44.957 --> 01:41:47.552
At least that is the name written
on this mandate.

1504
01:41:47.652 --> 01:41:51.943
If you have a paper
showing exactly the same ...

1505
01:41:52.741 --> 01:41:54.637
No, it did not help.

1506
01:41:55.535 --> 01:41:56.633
Softly, softly ...

1507
01:41:58.928 --> 01:42:00.824
Are arrested for attempted murder

1508
01:42:00.923 --> 01:42:05.713
violations
matrices of government.

1509
01:42:10.104 --> 01:42:11.900
I think the plan worked.

1510
01:42:12.399 --> 01:42:15.193
Since the explosion
the vessel did not set it.

1511
01:42:15.692 --> 01:42:20.284
- You did.
- Hannibal, do not do this. Hannibal, please.

1512
01:42:20.319 --> 01:42:21.282
How are you?

1513
01:42:22.479 --> 01:42:23.876
Not good.

1514
01:42:24.276 --> 01:42:27.269
I mean, I feel all there.

1515
01:42:28.467 --> 01:42:29.963
Do this for a long time.

1516
01:42:30.961 --> 01:42:33.755
Okay, operator, that is all.
Take it, boys.

1517
01:42:39.743 --> 01:42:43.235
What is the difference between a bruise
and a blow to the head?

1518
01:42:45.131 --> 01:42:49.223
Murdock was wonderful.
You look good. Everything was great.

1519
01:42:50.821 --> 01:42:52.218
You did a good job. Are you okay?

1520
01:42:53.116 --> 01:42:54.114
Is something wrong?

1521
01:42:54.214 --> 01:42:57.607
Forget Hannibal to plan
next time.

1522
01:42:58.506 --> 01:42:59.703
All right. All right.

1523
01:43:00.402 --> 01:43:04.293
- How is your conscience, big guy?
- Quiet.

1524
01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.658
- Agent Sosa?
- I am.

1525
01:43:21.758 --> 01:43:22.857
- I want to talk with Sosa agent.
- I am.

1526
01:43:22.956 --> 01:43:25.251
From now on, your prisoner
remains in federal custody.

1527
01:43:25.351 --> 01:43:27.447
- I have a warrant for this man.
- From this moment ...

1528
01:43:27.547 --> 01:43:28.844
I'll be your doctor.

1529
01:43:29.143 --> 01:43:31.039
I'll be your doctor.
I will treat you. You need stitches?

1530
01:43:31.438 --> 01:43:33.634
Please tell me you need stitches.
I can sew very well.

1531
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:36.527
Gentlemen ...

1532
01:43:39.022 --> 01:43:44.510
CIA believes both ethical actions
and the modern standards of action.

1533
01:43:45.009 --> 01:43:49.799
Therefore, we want to offer our apologies
most sincerely for what happened.

1534
01:43:51.595 --> 01:43:54.391
- Good day. God bless you.
- Where you going?

1535
01:43:57.385 --> 01:43:58.383
Who?

1536
01:44:03.073 --> 01:44:04.370
I did not catch your name.

1537
01:44:07.064 --> 01:44:11.355
- My name is Lynch.
- Of course it is.

1538
01:44:14.249 --> 01:44:15.347
He said Lynch?

1539
01:44:31.216 --> 01:44:33.311
Everybody be quiet!

1540
01:44:33.411 --> 01:44:34.509
Bring plates.

1541
01:44:39.298 --> 01:44:41.893
- Lieutenant ...
- Sir, I knew that coming ...

1542
01:44:41.993 --> 01:44:43.091
- Give me a minute.
- Yes, sir.

1543
01:44:50.376 --> 01:44:51.673
It's a great destruction.

1544
01:44:52.172 --> 01:44:53.369
I got cards.

1545
01:44:55.066 --> 01:44:58.160
You will need to accuse everyone
escape from federal custody.

1546
01:44:58.261 --> 01:44:59.159
What?

1547
01:45:00.057 --> 01:45:03.051
I was wrongly convicted,
but still it is illegal to escape from prison.

1548
01:45:03.450 --> 01:45:06.344
Mr Smith and his team helped us
recover plates.

1549
01:45:06.443 --> 01:45:09.437
Federal fugitives are still
and to arrest him.

1550
01:45:10.335 --> 01:45:11.632
That is something minor, sir.

1551
01:45:12.530 --> 01:45:15.923
Perhaps her
But for you, Captain ...

1552
01:45:16.223 --> 01:45:17.819
Repromovam I had to grade.

1553
01:45:18.119 --> 01:45:21.112
So that will be handed
Sheriff Service in Long Beach ...

1554
01:45:21.811 --> 01:45:25.802
- I understand, but this ...
- This should be done.

1555
01:45:27.598 --> 01:45:29.195
They are Harry Houdini ...

1556
01:45:30.893 --> 01:45:32.390
Up, get out there.

1557
01:45:33.687 --> 01:45:34.486
Let us go.

1558
01:45:34.585 --> 01:45:36.981
- Wait, stop, stay.
- Move.

1559
01:45:37.979 --> 01:45:40.474
- That is wrong.
- Yes, worry not.

1560
01:45:40.574 --> 01:45:42.769
I will do my best as possible
entitled to it.

1561
01:45:43.867 --> 01:45:46.062
- I know it do that.
- Sorry.

1562
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:22.287
Nice plan, Is.

1563
01:46:22.885 --> 01:46:26.378
Yes, I put Lynch in prison.

1564
01:46:26.577 --> 01:46:29.372
I returned the cards. We stand
head up, I did the right thing.

1565
01:46:29.772 --> 01:46:32.665
Yes, I have closed us.
That is stupid.

1566
01:46:33.065 --> 01:46:34.963
We did it again, Hannibal.

1567
01:46:35.262 --> 01:46:37.457
I trusted the system
and came back against us.

1568
01:46:37.757 --> 01:46:40.551
Remember, boys, regardless
as may seem completely random,

1569
01:46:41.149 --> 01:46:42.247
There is always a plan.

1570
01:46:43.145 --> 01:46:43.943
Kid ...

1571
01:46:44.143 --> 01:46:48.135
Well, I didn
to do that, boss, but ...

1572
01:46:56.019 --> 01:46:57.715
I love it when a plan is made.
