00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.439
Good afternoon, Ms. Ocean.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:34.556
Hi.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.639
As you know, parole is a privilege.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.269
And one of the restrictions
on any parolee

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.629
is to avoid the company

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.673
of any person who has a criminal record
of any kind.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.192
That would include
most of your extended family.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.000
Yeah, that's obviously not something
I'm proud of.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.232
Would this pose an impossible challenge
for you?

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.549
No. No.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.111
I don't want that life.
I never wanted that life.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.919
My brother,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.315
may he rest in peace,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.477
was a criminal.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.233
I loved him,

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.595
but he was a conman.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.955
It was in his blood.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.520
- And it's not in your blood?
- No.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.990
No, sir. Um...

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.430
I fell for the wrong person.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.875
It was a mistake.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.195
Uh...

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.714
But it happened.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.790
And, um, if I were to be released,
I would, um...

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.600
Sorry.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.632
Wow, just saying that...

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.713
If I were to be released,

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.954
I would
just want the simple life.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.072
I just wanna hold down a job,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.117
make some friends,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.959
go for a walk after work
in the fresh air

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.354
and pay my bills.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.279
Simple life?

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.716
Nice one.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.439
- Heard about that?
- Who didn't?

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.829
I had five years to rehearse it.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.480
- Here's your stuff.
- Thank you.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.520
Nice watch.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.870
- It's my brother's.
- Left it to you?

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.594
I stole it.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.917
It's fine, Dina. He stole it, too.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.238
So we're still gonna get
a regular shipment next week.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.676
You take your cut,
plus a few extra cartons, okay?

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.198
I want you to trade 'em, not smoke 'em.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.553
<i>So where you going?</i>

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.030
<i>Well, I have 45 bucks, Dina.</i>

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.399
<i>I can go anywhere I want.</i>

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.514
Hi, I'd like to return these.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.194
Oh, of course.
Do you have your receipt?

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.999
No, but they're unopened.
They haven't been touched.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.514
I really need your receipt.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.237
They are sealed. They are brand-new.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.994
Do you have the credit card
that you used?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.629
This is ridiculous!
I bought these last week.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.439
Ma'am, you can try client services
on the sixth floor.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.836
You know what? Never mind.
I'll just keep 'em.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.390
Jesus.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.996
Can I at least get a bag?

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.150
Sure.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.470
Thank you.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.874
Hi. I'm checking out of room 2814.
Gary Randall.

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.992
- Did you have a pleasant stay?
- Terrific.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.670
Hey, my name is Monica.

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.156
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Or arrange transportation?

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.039
I think we're all set.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.877
<i>Hi, this is Mrs. Randall.
We just checked out of room 2814.</i>

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.872
<i>- May I speak with Monica, please?
- This is she.</i>

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:49.474
- Hi, Monica.
- Hi.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.670
Hi.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.117
Uh, we just found out
our flight was canceled.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.669
- Oh, no!
- I know, I know.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.639
And instead of staying
in some horrible airport hotel,

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.394
we were hoping that maybe we could get
our original room back?

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.233
Yeah, we can give you
that same room back.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.199
That would be amazing.
Thank you so much.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.713
<i>Um, we're just gonna go grab a bite.</i>

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.599
<i>Would it be possible
to get the maid in there now?</i>

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.035
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.919
<i>Perfect. We really appreciate it.</i>

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.110
<i>It's not a problem.</i>

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:16.839
<i>Thank you so much. We'll see you soon.</i>

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.634
Hi.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.360
I'm so sorry. Can you finish up later?
I just have to get off my feet.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.960
- Of course.
- Thank you so much.

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.230
- Have a great day.
- You, too!

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.919
Bye-bye.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.838
<i>And he did not move in!</i>

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.594
<i>And he wants his money back.</i>

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.717
<i>And he gets his money back.</i>

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.873
<i>If you said no, does that mean
you didn't take the money?</i>

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.395
What crate are you on?

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.756
Fifteen.

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.353
<i>Listen.
You think I like you?</i>

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:30.430
<i>You think I believe you?</i>

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.432
<i>You think I trust anything
that you're saying?</i>

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:34.239
<i>The answer is absolutely not.</i>

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.672
Guys, it's 9:30.

00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.432
It's too much. It's too much.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.273
It's three fingers from the top.

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.272
Not one, it's three.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.553
It's a rerun, April.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.672
She slept with her cousin,
crashed the car.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:52.280
The baby's not his.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.153
What's that taste like?

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.999
Vodka.

00:06:57.080 --> 00:06:59.311
Vodka. Exactly. But I don't want vodka.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.717
I want vodka and water.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.280
And do you wanna know why?

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.470
Uh, sure.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.075
'Cause when you're drunk,
it tastes like vodka.

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.873
- Right.
- Right.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.600
<i>I don't care!</i>

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:43.313
Oh, missed you, too.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.991
You better be in there.

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.359
I know you're there, Reuben.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.510
You can come on out.

00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:17.880
I was just paying my respects.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.315
From around the corner?

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.800
What are you doing here?

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:24.595
They thought I'd be the best one
to talk to you.

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.991
Hmm. Gotta go.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.755
He didn't want you to do this, Deborah.

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.910
Do what?

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.673
Whatever it is he wouldn't tell us
you're gonna do.

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:34.875
- Look, Deb.
- Hmm.

00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:38.556
Sometimes,
just knowing the job will work

00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:41.155
is satisfaction enough.

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.830
You don't actually gotta do it.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.353
What else did he say?

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.111
- He said it was brilliant.
- Oh, okay.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.079
And that you would probably
end up back in prison.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.391
I'm not gonna end up back in prison.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.110
Okay?

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.155
I gotta go.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.710
Be careful.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.431
You're looking sharp.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.633
- Mmm!
- Hey, hey! Take it easy.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.120
Been in the slammer.

00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:29.714
Oh, I just thought
you changed your number.

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.394
Did you get the credit line?

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.031
- Not yet.
- Why not?

00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.792
Because I don't know what it's for.

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.030
Oh, my God.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:40.350
Don't do that.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.671
Do what?

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:45.076
That would be my "I've just been in jail
for five years

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.554
"and my partner lets me down" face.

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.633
Hey, I'm not your partner. Yet.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.917
This is nice.
Chain-link, barb wire.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.954
Brought you something.

00:09:58.520 --> 00:09:59.510
Oh...

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.879
Um, can I exchange something you stole?

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.159
Well, if you're gonna have a problem
with stealing,

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:06.879
you're not gonna like
the rest of this conversation.

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.799
- What, we're gonna shoplift?
- Maybe.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.036
No. See, this is what you do.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.317
You make me guess and then,
I'm interested.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.473
And then you think because
I'm interested, that I wanna do it.

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.160
Don't you wanna do things
you're interested in?

00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.515
I'm interested in brain surgery.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:20.393
Well, we know that's not gonna happen.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.917
Whatever. You don't wanna tell me...

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.395
It's jewels.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.233
Spectacular, great, big, blingy,
big old Liz Taylor jewels

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.478
that are locked in a vault
50 feet underground.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.833
How do we get them out of the vault?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.793
They're gonna bring 'em to us.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.077
Oh, bugger!

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:49.070
Well...

00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.914
Nice place.

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.355
Try heating it.

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:54.200
There's a room for you upstairs.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:57.192
Your stuff's upstairs, too.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.351
You know, I borrowed some shit.
Figured you weren't using it.

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.030
So, is this your gallery?

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.190
Yeah, one of them.

00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.794
Hmm. Where are the others?

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.833
Well, I'm opening one in London.
Got plans for another one in Tokyo.

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:44.116
We're talking about LA,
but I'm not sure that makes sense.

00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.999
It's all a bit derivative
out there, you know?

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.879
So this is the only one
that exists?

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:50.350
Well, physically.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.278
Excuse me one second.

00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.480
Sorry. Sorry.

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.632
Oh, my God.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.319
I was meaning to call you.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:08.314
Jesus, it's great to see you.
You look...

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.709
Recently incarcerated?

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.314
Wonderful. You look wonderful.

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.119
Do you know what a shiv is?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.237
Okay, stop. Just stop.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:18.719
Oh, such a nice face.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.680
You know, inside,

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.079
you're what we call a pretty girl.

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.157
- I'll call the police.
- Okay.

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.796
Do you know what we do with snitches?

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.031
<i>- He saw you?
- Oh, yeah.</i>

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.833
<i>Why would you do
something like that?</i>

00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:39.556
Closure?

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:40.756
Bullshit!

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.911
Jesus!

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.114
So did you...

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.796
No.

00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.715
Just a little button.

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.476
<i>So at first, I thought banks.
'Cause you know...</i>

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.909
<i>That's where they have money?</i>

00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:14.753
<i>Exactly.
But that's kind of boring.</i>

00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:17.116
So then I thought 10 banks.

00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:20.034
Then I realized that would be maybe
coming from an angry place so...

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.316
- Good you realized that.
- Yes.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:23.520
Then I couldn't even hear myself think.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.717
You know, five women in one cell.

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.998
So I got myself thrown in solitary
for a little peace and quiet

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:31.837
and that's where
I finally came up with it.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.912
- It's still a museum.
- So?

00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.037
So, it's not like
robbing a liquor store.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.954
I'm sorry, I don't speak Ukrainian.

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.838
I said, "We're not robbing a museum."

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.072
- We're robbing someone in a museum.
- In a museum.

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.515
Yeah, you mentioned.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:18.716
Look.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.715
- Even if this was possible...
- It is possible.

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.877
Even if it was, we'd need, like,

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.032
20 people
and half a million dollars.

00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.110
Seven.

00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.270
Seven million?

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:29.953
Seven people and 20 grand.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.311
Why do you need to do this?

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.359
Because it's what I'm good at.

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.637
Uh, yeah.

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.558
You know what?
I have run this thing 1,000 times.

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:44.913
Every time I got caught, I fixed it.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.560
And in three years,
I wasn't getting caught anymore.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.315
By the time I was paroled,
it was running like clockwork.

00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:50.994
Perfectly.

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:54.239
And you were there with me,
every step of the way.

00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:56.119
Oh, honey, is this a proposal?

00:14:56.280 --> 00:14:58.237
Baby, I don't have a diamond yet.

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.196
Come on. Do you really wanna spend

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.073
the rest of your life
watering down well vodka?

00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.277
Because it's really kind of a waste.

00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.591
Come on. Take a bite.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.032
Just take a bite.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.511
- You're really irritating.
- Open.

00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:17.909
That's good.

00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:19.796
Very good.

00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:25.717
<i>So each year they host
the biggest party in the world.</i>

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.111
<i>And they always get
a huge celebrity to host.</i>

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.391
<i>This year, it's Daphne Kluger.</i>

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.551
<i>- Wow.
- Yeah. But she's not our mark.</i>

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.710
<i>So who's the mark?</i>

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:36.156
All right, who wants to go first?

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.029
Yes.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.395
Do you know who you're wearing?

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:40.755
Uh, ooh...

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.240
La Perla. It's black.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.596
No,
I mean who's dressing you?

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.353
I don't really know yet.

00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.715
The designer.

00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.998
I don't know yet.

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.594
But as soon as I do,

00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.712
you'll be the very first person
that I tell.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.712
Uh, next question?

00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:59.313
<i>- All right, we need a designer.
- Exactly!</i>

00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.600
Now a lot of these we could target.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:04.275
But Anna won't approve them
and Anna has to approve everything.

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.390
I know.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.755
There's a few
less-established choices

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.559
but they're not gonna give us
the juice we need.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.630
So...

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:13.359
Rose Weil.
Why do I know that name?

00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:15.273
She was big, in the '90s.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:17.636
Oh, my God, all the Edwardian collars
and the ruffles.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.877
Travesty. But Anna still likes her.

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:22.356
They do Easter together
every year in Kent.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.476
- Brits?
- Irish.

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:27.270
And she owes the IRS $5 million.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.600
<i>It's bad.</i>

00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.917
<i>There's a lien on her assets,
they've impounded her passport.</i>

00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.639
<i>The bank seized her townhouse.</i>

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:37.995
<i>She sounds amazing.</i>

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.150
<i>Yeah.</i>

00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:40.396
<i>I think we got lucky.</i>

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.398
<i>She gambled everything on this.</i>

00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:46.315
This is a flight to nowhere
without any peanuts.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.319
Self-financed.
Credit from an Omaha bank.

00:16:50.760 --> 00:16:52.035
Those guys over there?

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.471
The only ones
who'll still loan her money.

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.638
They look a little worried.

00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.714
Yeah, who can blame them?
This is a train wreck.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:22.799
Congratulations.

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:25.915
Who are you?

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.230
Big fans.

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.073
- Very big.
- Oh.

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:30.835
- That was...
- Just...

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.959
- Gorgeous.
- Mm-hmm.

00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.633
No, it wasn't.

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.079
It was a disaster.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.200
I think you're being
kind of hard on yourself.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.476
Very.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:43.593
Did you read this?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.829
It's by a blogger.

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:47.470
Oh.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.636
"Rose Weil.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:55.639
"Her new collection is like taking
a tour of your grandmother's closet.

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:58.355
"Just as dated, and just as musty.

00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.240
"The Eskimo shove their elders out
on an ice floe.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:02.436
"Just saying."

00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.074
That's very cruel.

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:06.118
But it doesn't make it true.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.554
How did I get here?

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.871
You spent $18 million in two years

00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:13.759
and had two houseboats on the Seine.

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:15.596
I'm old.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:17.478
Hey, you're not old.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:18.550
I'm old,

00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:20.559
and I'm going to prison.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.837
Then I'm going to be really,
really poor.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.879
Not necessarily.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.996
What if we could make all this go away?

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:31.516
Even get your passport back.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.390
How?

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.756
Dress Daphne Kluger for the Met Ball.

00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:41.710
Hmm.

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:43.515
Are you mad?

00:18:43.640 --> 00:18:44.710
Mmm-mmm.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.429
No, hang on a minute.

00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:48.830
Are you journalists?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.514
- Absolutely not.
- God, no.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.636
Uh-uh.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.395
Mmm.

00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:56.873
- She seems sort of tense.
- Can be.

00:18:56.960 --> 00:19:02.718
Good body. Good boobs. Huge features.
Eyes like Bambi.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:05.835
Yeah. She can take quite a lot.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:08.555
Maybe we could give her...

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.958
Maybe we could give her this.

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.512
God, no. Not chic.
We can do better than that.

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.036
It's called the Toussaint.

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:22.359
Named for Jeanne Toussaint, Cartier's
director of jewelry from '33 to '68.

00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:26.036
- It's over six pounds of diamonds.
- Right.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.271
After she died,
they sold it back to Cartier

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.875
and they've kept it
in their vault ever since.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:32.554
- They've never let it out.
- Mm-hmm.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:35.110
So then, how are we gonna get it out?

00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.312
Well, they might let it out for her.

00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.955
The theme of this year's ball
is European royalty,

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.476
of which the crown jewels
are a featured element.

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:51.077
So, if you were to insist
on the Toussaint

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.993
on behalf of Daphne Kluger...

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.440
Must be worth
quite a lot.

00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:06.510
Yeah.

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:08.838
- These are all Russians.
- They're hackers.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.150
Are there no hackers who aren't Russian?

00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.835
No, there's barely any Russians
who aren't hackers.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.193
- Just keep looking, please.
- Sure.

00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.190
Okay.

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.039
Sorry about Danny.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.675
Sorry about your pops.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:09.876
So, what are you doing here?

00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.632
I might have something for you.

00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.315
A job.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.278
You wanna run some stuff
through the store?

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:17.999
No, thank you.

00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:19.514
A little more than that.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.149
How long would it take you
to make seven pieces of jewelry

00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:26.357
if the stones were already cut?

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.194
Probably five or six hours.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:33.595
How long if I told you you didn't
have to live with your mother anymore?

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:36.189
Less.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.119
I'm never taking the F-train again.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.310
She's in.

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.073
She is in where?

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.671
This what you talking about?
Bunch of vases.

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.274
Yeah, that's the Egyptian wing.

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.270
She's in the Met?

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.476
Security cameras.

00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.078
There's a lot of 'em.

00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.190
My name's Debbie.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.477
- Nine Ball.
- What's your real name?

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.791
- Eight Ball.
- We use real names around here.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.753
Could I talk to you for a minute?

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.230
I asked you to get me a hacker.

00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.834
She is one of the best hackers
on the East Coast.

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.910
Oh, I'm honored...

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.957
She has other clients.
They don't know her real name either.

00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:16.794
- I'm sorry, "other clients"? Now?
- Yeah.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.714
Did you tell her what her cut was?

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.792
- Of course.
- And?

00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:30.791
Look. She's smoking!

00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.512
So, Nine Ball.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.272
Uh, do I call you Nine Ball? Nine...

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.999
Or Baller.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:45.071
Baller? Okay. Okay.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:46.630
Uh-oh.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.477
You know your footprint
is a disaster, right?

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:52.718
- I'm sorry, what?
- Your footprint.

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.116
- My footprint?
- Yes, ma'am.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.840
If you're planning to steal shit,
you definitely got to clean this up,

00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.520
'cause right now,
my little sister could hack you.

00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:03.715
Oh, right. 'Cause we had this guy...

00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:11.760
Gotcha.

00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:13.998
We'll clean that up.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:19.720
- Can I ask where we're going?
- You'll see in a minute.

00:23:19.880 --> 00:23:21.917
Right, we're going
to meet Doris Kluger...

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:22.990
- Daphne.
- Daphne.

00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:24.070
Someone even more famous.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.072
Someone who makes
Daphne Kluger jealous.

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:27.750
- Jealous?
- Hmm.

00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:31.672
In a minute, we're gonna
stand up. She's gonna sit down.

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:33.479
You'll recognize her. Just be cool.

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:34.875
- Aloof.
- But kind.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:36.440
- But not too kind.
- Yeah.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.116
You're sweating.

00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:39.839
- Yeah, look, I sweat.
- Don't.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.676
On her left hand is a tattoo.
I want you to take it, admire it,

00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:46.315
but make physical contact,
and that's when we'll get it.

00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:47.955
"It"? What's "it"?

00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:54.910
Hi.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.470
Wow.

00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.550
Oh, I know you!

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.549
Yes, I know you. I've seen you.
I've seen you in things.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.230
Yeah.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:05.869
- No, you're good. You're really good.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:06.950
Yeah.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.355
I just really wanted to say,
"Thank you."

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.790
Thank you?

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.873
For helping us
with the feline rescue project.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.030
Penelope Stern? Is she even old enough
to go to the Met Ball?

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:22.110
Apparently.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.873
Who cares
who's dressing her anyway?

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.670
Uh, I think <i>Page Six.</i>

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.240
I never met with Rose Weil.
You said I met with everybody.

00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.995
- You said she was a relic.
- I meant iconic.

00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:39.072
Do you want me to set up a meeting?

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.832
- Yes!
- Okay.

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.359
<i>I watched one
of her films last night.</i>

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.954
<i>She's actually really good.</i>

00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.793
<i>Whatever you do, don't fawn.</i>

00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.555
<i>- Just ignore her.
- Indifference, it's an aphrodisiac.</i>

00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.870
<i>Very little eye contact.</i>

00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:58.440
Rose.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.791
- Oh, Daphne. Ms. Kluger.
- Finally.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:05.629
So, thank you so much
for meeting me so last minute.

00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:08.958
I am such an admirer of yours.
I have so many of your pieces.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.636
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:16.634
So, this search... It has not been easy.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:20.350
And everything we've seen,
you know, it's been great.

00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:21.749
But it's been tired,

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.038
and you just...
You seem different.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.272
You know, like
you're immune to judgment.

00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.874
Like you're above all that.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.150
I'm sorry, what?

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:42.120
What is going on?

00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.199
Uh... Oh.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:47.273
Sorry. Um, what were you saying?

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.474
I'm trying to hire you for the Met Ball.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:54.915
Great. Thank you. My honor.

00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:56.870
Flattered.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:03.110
Wait till you see. This girl has some
of the best hands I've ever seen.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.033
Is this one sane?

00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.078
Hundred percent.

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.755
All right, here's how we're playing.
Red is money, okay?

00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:12.236
Really? Three-card Monte?

00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:16.599
Follow the Queen, live your dream.
But don't sleep. Don't sleep.

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:18.359
'Cause she might disappear,
you saw that?

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.160
It's lit, right? She came back, though.
She likes you.

00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.279
All right, let's hit it.
And we're following the Queen.

00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.080
And we're following the Queen.

00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.310
Is this our only choice?

00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.352
The turnover in pickpockets is huge.

00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.239
Where she at? Where that bitch at?

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.870
Where she at?

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:36.030
That one.

00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.600
Wanna call a lifeline on that one?

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:41.672
No. That one.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.712
All right. That one is mine.

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.752
- Come on, there's no hard feelings.
- Yeah.

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.838
And you're a real one, you know?
You know what I mean?

00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.033
Yeah, come back any time.

00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.474
- Not bad.
- Yeah. I thought so.

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:59.190
Turkey and provolone, please.

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.873
So, I'm lifting one necklace.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:04.317
- It's a very nice necklace.
- Uh, lettuce and tomato.

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.633
- And this is legit, the money?
- Hundred percent.

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:13.471
- Okay, I'm in.
- Great.

00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:17.758
Uh, can I get my watch back, please?

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:26.518
Thank you. And hers as well.

00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.119
No, I...

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.158
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.229
Who do we have,
who do we have? Uh...

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.996
- What about Ivy?
- No, still in jail.

00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.634
- Really?
- What about him?

00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:40.956
- Well, he's a him.
- So?

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.110
Don't want a him.

00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.230
Because it's a him
or because it's a "him"?

00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.310
No, he's not a "him."

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.073
- I barely know the guy.
- What's wrong with a him?

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:49.238
A him gets noticed, a her gets ignored,
and for once, we wanna be ignored.

00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.114
What about Tammy?

00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.360
Hey, buddy, can you do me a favor?
Can you take that outside?

00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.910
Debbie, I am with my family.
I told you...

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.195
<i>I'm outside.</i>

00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:25.633
- What?
<i>- I'm in your garage.</i>

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.039
- Deb?
- Hmm?

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.591
Deb, what are you doing here?
I thought you were in jail.

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:37.876
Mmm, I got out.

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:42.511
Look at all this. Thought you retired?

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.470
I did.

00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.235
Not as exciting as hijacking trucks

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.312
that are smuggling dishwashers
from Canada, right?

00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:51.039
Yeah, well, I don't do that anymore.

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.078
- But you were so very good at it.
- Thank you.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.358
Yeah. So these are all
for personal use, right?

00:28:56.520 --> 00:28:59.911
- What do you want?
- Just wanna reconnect.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.873
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.076
- Reconnect?
- Mm-hmm.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:05.920
You're not bored out here,
are you, Tam-Tam?

00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.834
No, I'm not bored out here at all.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.753
- Good, good.
- No.

00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.038
- Why would you ask that?
- Because I need a fence.

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.477
I told you I don't do that anymore.
I'm out.

00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:20.155
- It's a big job.
- I don't care.

00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:21.476
Do you want me to tell you
how big a job it is?

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.233
No. No, I really don't.

00:29:23.440 --> 00:29:25.318
I think I'm gonna tell you
how big the job is.

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.234
- Are you kidding?
- No.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.517
- Mommy, when's dinner ready?
- Shit!

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:38.757
Uh, sweetheart, I will be right there.
I'm so sorry. Mommy will be right there.

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:40.758
But I'm hungry!

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:44.158
I know, sweetheart, I promise,
I will be right there.

00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:50.194
- Thanks a lot.
- She sounds sweet.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.956
How do you explain all this
to your husband?

00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.160
eBay.

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:20.394
Okay, everybody.
Let's get started.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.632
We would like to present you all
with a hypothetical situation.

00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:36.759
- How hypothetical?
- Not very, unless we screw up.

00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:42.158
$16.5 million in each of your
bank accounts, five weeks from now.

00:30:44.520 --> 00:30:47.752
In three and a half weeks,
the Met will be hosting its annual ball

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.630
celebrating its new costume exhibit,
and we are going to rob it.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:53.554
Not the ball itself,

00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:56.474
but a very important set of diamonds
that will be attending the ball.

00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:59.110
On the neck of Daphne Kluger.

00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:00.760
Who Rose will be dressing.

00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:02.672
- The Toussaint?
- Very good.

00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.711
Once Daphne is inadvertently onboard,

00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:08.076
we can then get the necklace
out of the Cartier vault,

00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.277
hack the Met security system,
thank you, Nine Ball,

00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:12.115
and infiltrate the Gala,

00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.357
considered to be
one of the most exclusive...

00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:16.392
The most exclusive.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:20.196
The most exclusive party invitation
in America.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.076
So go home, get your affairs in order,

00:31:23.240 --> 00:31:25.152
because tomorrow, we begin pulling off

00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.791
one of the biggest jewelry heists
in history.

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:40.274
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the big city.

00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.910
- How long?
- Uh, not too long, I promise.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.633
I'll be back before you know it.

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.235
What are you gonna do?

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.552
I am going to help my friend Debbie
with her job.

00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:52.070
What kind of job?

00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.512
- It's complicated.
- Can I come with you?

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:58.157
No, sweetie, this is Mommy's
very special work trip.

00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:01.596
It is my account,
it is my money,

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.114
and the only reason I can't access it

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.032
is because I cannot remember
the make and model

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.520
of my second cousin's first car.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:08.552
So if you could just...

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.509
I don't wanna make a withdrawal,
I would like to make a deposit.

00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:14.953
Yes, I...

00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.915
- Hey, can I...
- Shh.

00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:21.433
Exactly, yes. Yes, I'll hold. What's up?

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:24.434
Oh, hey, I was wondering
if I can get a MetroCard,

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:27.559
'cause I'm skateboarding in
from Queens every day.

00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:30.116
Can I get a MetroCard?

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.119
- I don't have a MetroCard.
- You don't have a MetroCard?

00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.396
I don't have a MetroCard.

00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:35.914
What are you, a tourist?

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:40.592
- You're fascinating.
- That's it?

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:43.434
You're gonna just throw me one dub
for a MetroCard? That's it?

00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.910
How about this? We steal $50 million,

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.151
I'll buy everybody MetroCards.
How's that?

00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.350
Okay.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:53.800
- Is that your brother?
- Mm-hmm.

00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:55.430
He's hot.

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:57.160
You sure he's dead or...

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.356
No.

00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:05.036
Yes, sweetie,
Mommy is in her new job now.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.680
Charlie, will you do me a favor?
Can you put that right there?

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.633
What, sweetheart?

00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:10.915
Uh, uh, well...

00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.394
Mommy finds very special toys,
and then she finds new homes for them.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.590
Yes, exactly like your turtle.
That is exactly right.

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.717
Thank you so much, Charlie,
thank you.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:25.800
Sweetheart, I have to go.

00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.919
I just got a brand-new toy for Debbie,
and I can't wait to play with it.

00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:43.430
Zirconium.

00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:47.069
- I like it.
- Yeah, I bet you do. Unhand the man.

00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:48.720
- Thank you very much.
- Okay.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.477
Here are your very special glasses.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.750
If Rose can pull this off,
and that is a very big "if,"

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.196
these glasses will
scan the real necklace

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.954
and send a digital print
back to us here.

00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.840
Once we have that,

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.960
this thing will print
a replica of the necklace in zirconium.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:36.839
- Where is it?
- These are not the Toussaint.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.716
We thought you might
want to see these first.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:42.317
Right. What for?

00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:46.635
There are certain logistical problems
with that necklace.

00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.153
We wouldn't even know how to insure it.

00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:52.560
All right.

00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.560
"We were very clear
on the phone."

00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.790
Yes. We were very clear on the phone.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.758
We are only interested in the Toussaint.

00:34:57.840 --> 00:34:58.990
Yeah.

00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.759
Well, then, that would have to be
a much longer discussion.

00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.873
That necklace is valued at
over $150 million.

00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.277
Well, I'm not really a numbers person.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:19.434
It would require its own security team,
a new insurance policy.

00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.671
I'm sure you'll work out
all those details.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:23.672
Oh, it's not that simple.

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:26.680
I'm afraid the answer is no.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:29.190
No?

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.874
No.

00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:37.150
Look, can I be frank?

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.760
I have always loved Cartier.

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:45.153
I think, historically, this has been
the most significant house in the world.

00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:49.992
But there is a whole generation
out there who mispronounce your name.

00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:52.913
French can be difficult.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.030
<i>Oui.</i>

00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.676
Stop it.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:18.473
- Stop, that doesn't help. Stop.
- Okay, all right. All right.

00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.400
Mmm.

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.558
We're too far underground.
Can't get a signal.

00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.156
Very secure down here, huh?

00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.599
Five feet of solid concrete.

00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.157
You said you wanted to see it
in the light.

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.438
You wanted to see the necklace
in the light.

00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:49.550
Right!

00:37:51.320 --> 00:37:52.879
- This is light.
- No.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.278
No, she means real light.
Natural light, yes.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:59.672
The red carpet happens
while the sun is still out.

00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:03.157
- Yes, no, I'm afraid that's vital.
- It's vital.

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:06.836
Mmm. No, I must have the sun.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:08.957
She must have the sun.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:11.271
- How is this light, Ms. Weil?
- Um...

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.553
Yes, I think, yes, we have the sun.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.954
Much better.

00:38:19.440 --> 00:38:20.430
Hmm.

00:38:24.520 --> 00:38:25.715
- There it is!
- All right.

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:26.950
Hello, sexy.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.352
Come on, come on.

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.075
Ms. Weil. Is she okay?

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:54.153
- She's fine. She needs to take it in.
- Hmm.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.436
This is her process.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.310
It looks really good.

00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:02.000
- It's so clear.
- Yeah.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:03.510
Come on.

00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.719
No, okay. You gotta...

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.030
No. Yep.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.435
If you are done, Ms. Weil,

00:39:14.520 --> 00:39:15.954
we'd like to...

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.390
Return this to the vault.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.750
<i>Ms. Weil?</i>

00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:21.876
Ms. Weil.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:26.474
Yes!

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.950
I'm done.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.440
Sweet.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.749
Mmm-hmm.

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:45.957
Oh, my God!

00:39:56.920 --> 00:39:58.832
- Well?
- I don't know.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:00.998
Well, you don't know
because this is only a muslin.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.675
It's going to be pink, for a start.

00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.638
I know it's going to be pink,
but I don't know.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:06.473
Yeah, I feel like it's the waist.
I feel like it's just, like...

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.233
And then the bottom.
I don't know about the bottom.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.073
We can definitely change the hem.

00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.754
- It's the necklace.
- Oh, no. It's not the necklace.

00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:14.150
It is the necklace. It's just messy.

00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:17.199
No, it's not messy.
It's messy 'cause it's safety pins.

00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:18.675
No, you must remember the diamonds.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.796
It's gonna be diamonds.

00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.280
I just feel like I look huge.

00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.840
Daphne.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.390
Hey, Daphne, come here.
Come here. Come here.

00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.997
Listen, listen.
Deep breath... Deep breath.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.955
Listen, look.

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:35.720
You've got one of the greatest necks
in the world.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.436
In fact, you've got the only neck
that could carry this necklace off.

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.269
With your neck,
this necklace...

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:49.195
You are gonna walk into that Met Gala

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.071
and you are gonna light up the sky.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.357
Thank you.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:03.279
You're welcome.

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.557
If you like him, you go right,

00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:06.915
and if you don't...

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.110
- I go left.
- Yeah, you go left.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.470
Okay, that sounds easy.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:11.994
- So do you like him?
- I like him a lot.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.435
Okay, why?

00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.875
He looks kind.

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.030
I'm gonna swipe right.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.236
- Okay. All right.
- Oh, my God!

00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:19.510
So does that mean...

00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:20.670
He liked you back!
He likes you, too!

00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.240
What happens now? What happens now?

00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.153
- So you can message him.
- Okay.

00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:27.040
And you can say,
maybe, the eggplant emoji

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.112
or maybe the girl that does this.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:20.830
Excuse me.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:23.596
Can you help me with something?
I think I'm a little lost.

00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:24.750
Of course, ma'am.

00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.719
I feel like I'm going in circles.
I came from Egypt back there

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.394
and I'm trying to get to Oceana.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:31.916
It's a little confusing. You can go
down the stairs to your right

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:33.673
or you can go back where you came from,
right down there.

00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.752
- Okay.
- It might take a little bit longer.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.516
Excuse me, ma'am.

00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.719
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.880
<i>Here's
one for your morning commute.</i>

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.238
<i>Last night, political artist Banksy
made a surprise contribution to the Met.</i>

00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.756
<i>Our founding mothers
appeared at the Met last night.</i>

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.320
<i>Traffic at 15 after the hour.</i>

00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.637
<i>Your news, all the time.</i>

00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:14.715
<i>This is a major security breach.</i>

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.950
How is this even possible?

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.873
He did it at the Tate, too.

00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:21.678
So you're saying the system
your company designed for our museum

00:43:21.840 --> 00:43:23.832
does nothing to prevent someone
like Banksy...

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.593
Sir, we're a little more focused on

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.717
keeping things in
than keeping things out.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.960
- Stop.
- I know.

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.433
Hey! How about an "Excuse me"?

00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.235
Correct me if I'm wrong.

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.880
You and your company are responsible

00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:12.037
for monitoring and safeguarding...

00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:14.112
Hey, want me to get the trash?

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.876
What? No.

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:18.680
You sure?
'Cause you got a lot here, buddy.

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:19.996
Fine. Just hurry it up.

00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:26.319
The museum's agreement
with your father's company is very...

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:28.233
- Generous.
- Specific.

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.834
Have a nice night.

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:31.992
The board expects
McCallister Security

00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.879
to live up to
the letter of that agreement.

00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.872
<i>We'll do a full audit of the system</i>

00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.271
<i>and update any part of it
that needs to be changed.</i>

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.069
<i>What does that mean?</i>

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.431
<i>- We'll go in and fix it.
- When?</i>

00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:44.716
<i>Immediately.</i>

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:47.349
So, now that we've gotten them
to make changes to their system,

00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:49.870
we can make changes, too,
and not be detected.

00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:51.196
Can you pull up the cameras?

00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:53.352
They've got
every inch of this place covered.

00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:55.876
But here is not where
we're gonna hit it.

00:44:56.240 --> 00:44:58.596
We are gonna do it in a spot
they don't even care about.

00:44:58.680 --> 00:44:59.670
Nine Ball.

00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.360
Now it's a New York State law that

00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:04.716
no cameras can be mounted
in a public bathroom.

00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:06.957
Apparently, it's a privacy violation.

00:45:07.120 --> 00:45:08.110
Unless you're into that.

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.316
And once we get the Toussaint,

00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:11.392
we are gonna have to get it out of there
without being detected

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:14.195
and they're gonna go over their security
footage with a fine-tooth comb,

00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:17.080
and anyone seen exiting that bathroom

00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.150
is gonna be a suspect.

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:19.910
So...

00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.759
So we get a mule.

00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.277
Somebody else is gonna move it for us.

00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.991
How much space do you need outside
that bathroom to plant it on somebody?

00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.510
I don't know. Nine feet?

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:34.400
And how long is it gonna take us
to build a nine-foot blind spot?

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:36.160
- Moving a camera?
- Mm-hmm.

00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:38.431
Bit by bit, 10, 12 days.

00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:41.909
Great.

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.632
How long did it take you
to figure all this out?

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:46.110
Mmm.

00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.873
Five years, eight months, and 12 days.

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:52.709
Give or take.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.753
Cartier has hired
the best private security in the world.

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.872
Guillermo DeVita led the pope's security
for 10 years.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:04.077
And as you know,
they've never lost a pope.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:06.558
Yuri Eshel, former Mossad

00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:09.474
and IDF Special Forces,
elite commando unit.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.357
I'm pretty sure they're assassins.

00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:14.791
- Well, it's a nice necklace.
- Yeah.

00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:18.079
So you can go ahead
and just add them to your list.

00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.879
- What list?
- That list.

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:21.519
It's not a list.

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.872
Okay. Who is he?

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:52.113
Hey, boo.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:05.393
Oh, Paul.

00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.953
You poor thing.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:02.515
Look at that.

00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.313
Oh!

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:14.712
We don't even know if
it is Banksy. It could be an imitator.

00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:41.070
That's all you got?

00:49:03.720 --> 00:49:05.120
Sweet.

00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:23.675
Good afternoon. <i>Vogue.</i>

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.638
Thank you for coming in
so last minute.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.434
Oh, of course.
Thank you for having me.

00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:30.398
I guess you heard,
we lost one of our coordinators.

00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:31.994
Yes, and that sounded awful.

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.231
- Chiggers.
- I know.

00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.960
- What are those, anyway?
- It's like a mite, I think.

00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.470
It burrows into the skin
and lays its eggs inside.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.711
And then they hatch
and they dig their way out.

00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.917
Apparently, it can last for weeks.

00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.113
Well, you certainly seem qualified.

00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:48.550
Thank you.

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:49.995
Maybe overqualified.

00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.992
Well, how can anyone be overqualified?

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:54.038
This is the Met Gala after all.

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.590
Gala. Met Gala.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.510
- It's Gala.
- Gala.

00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.670
Is it Gala?

00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:02.160
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah.

00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:07.279
<i>Roger Federer again one game away</i>

00:50:07.400 --> 00:50:09.153
<i>from another championship.</i>

00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:11.313
<i>The love for Federer in this place
is just incredible.</i>

00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:12.510
Anna.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.229
Uh, yeah?

00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:16.437
You have that interview
for the Met staff position.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:17.750
- Do it, do it.
- Okay.

00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:20.992
<i>You cannot be serious!
A backhand down-the-line win!</i>

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.796
We're really short on desk space,
so you'll be down here.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.673
This way.

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.470
- Okay, so here is your desk.
- Thank you.

00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.791
- And Christina will get you started.
- Great. Thank you so much.

00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.950
- Have a good day!
- Thanks!

00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:39.156
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.834
Was that the bathroom that we passed?

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:42.070
Oh, yes, just down the hall.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.276
Thank you.

00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.080
This is unbelievable.

00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.190
That's Leo?

00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.920
- Leo-Leo?
- There's only one Leo.

00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:12.878
Oh, my God! Taylor Swift!

00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.235
You're so white!

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.790
Can't we just go to this?
Do we have to steal stuff?

00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:17.950
Yes!

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:19.993
- Where is she?
- Table four, 10 o'clock.

00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.716
Straightest shot to the bathroom
without putting her in Siberia.

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:25.600
- There's a blank spot next to her.
- It's for her date.

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.155
Who's her date?

00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:30.310
I don't know.

00:51:33.080 --> 00:51:34.070
- Hi.
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:36.197
but I've got the final guest list
for the Chairman's Dinner.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.470
Oh, great.

00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:39.877
- You have all their arrival times?
- All their arrival times,

00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.839
including a few additional names
at the bottom.

00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:44.630
Claude Becker?

00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.634
<i>His publicist was into it.
I barely had to ask.</i>

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.069
Hello.

00:51:57.240 --> 00:51:58.469
They put me next to you.

00:51:58.840 --> 00:51:59.910
Oh, lucky me.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.150
Hello.

00:52:01.960 --> 00:52:02.996
Claude Becker.

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:05.029
Daphne Kluger.

00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.355
The ego has landed.

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:22.433
<i>How did you ever fall for
this schmuck?</i>

00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:24.716
Seriously?

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:27.712
Lou and I were going through
a rough patch

00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:32.156
and I really wanted
a big score of my own.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.595
So he roped you in?

00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:35.751
Mmm, not really.

00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.472
- What, told you the truth?
- Mmm.

00:52:40.160 --> 00:52:41.992
Only way to con a con, right?

00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.395
B1.

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.434
<i>Lou and I were rigging Bingo
and running cheap cons at Roulette.</i>

00:52:55.600 --> 00:52:57.592
<i>Lucky if we made $1,000 a night.</i>

00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:02.038
- Bingo!
- Bingo call.

00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:04.277
<i>So a friend of mine set me up
with this art dealer</i>

00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:06.238
<i>and we worked out
a simple little hustle.</i>

00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:07.675
- Claude Becker?
- Right through there.

00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:08.876
Thank you.

00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:10.992
Hi. I'm Debbie.

00:53:11.640 --> 00:53:12.710
- Claude Becker.
- Oh.

00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.676
<i>When somebody
got interested in a piece,</i>

00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.600
<i>I'd pose as another buyer
and drive up the price.</i>

00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:26.515
<i>Money was good
and he was great in the kitchen.</i>

00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.712
Oh, my God, it's so good.

00:53:30.120 --> 00:53:31.156
One day,

00:53:31.640 --> 00:53:34.280
uh, he asked me to pose as the seller,
not the buyer.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.036
What did you do?

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.674
Well...

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.995
One signature, half a million dollars.

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.240
<i>He said it was simple.</i>

00:53:50.840 --> 00:53:53.480
<i>I'd hand them the documents,
and they'd slide me a check.</i>

00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:56.758
<i>The whole thing would take
a couple minutes, tops.</i>

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.150
Sorry we're late.

00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:08.549
- Not at all.
- It's okay.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:09.990
- Very nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:11.992
- It's a beautiful piece.
- Oh, we just love it!

00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:17.234
<i>He was right.
It all happened very quickly.</i>

00:54:17.440 --> 00:54:19.955
You have a right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney...

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.352
<i>It wasn't my painting.
She brought the picture to me.</i>

00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:25.432
She had documentation, signatures.

00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:26.954
And you two were dating?

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.396
What?

00:54:28.520 --> 00:54:29.749
Not saying a word.

00:54:30.760 --> 00:54:31.830
Are you sure?

00:54:33.920 --> 00:54:37.834
'Cause he's not being quite
as tight-lipped as you are.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.912
Are these your signatures?

00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.231
Yeah, I will testify.

00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:48.116
I was defrauded too, right?

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:49.680
I'll be right outside.

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:20.710
Hey!

00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.355
We need to talk.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.312
You better tell me
this is not what I think it is.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.358
What?

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.954
Claude Becker.

00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:31.836
I didn't do that.

00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.633
I'm not a croupier, okay?

00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:36.314
Or a tourist with a bucket of quarters.

00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:37.590
Don't con me.

00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.917
You do not run a job in a job!

00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.117
It's not going to matter.

00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:43.955
We are going to get caught.

00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.349
Stop it. We're not.

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.874
Why do you do this?

00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:52.034
Why can't you just do a job?

00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:53.833
Why does there always
have to be an asterisk?

00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:56.714
You frame him, I walk.

00:55:56.880 --> 00:55:58.030
Stop.

00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.560
This is just like last time.

00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:01.915
Lou. Lou!

00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:04.036
Lou.

00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.232
He sent me to jail.

00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.031
You have no idea what that's like.

00:56:13.920 --> 00:56:17.311
Yeah, well, he's gonna do it again.

00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:19.119
No, he's not.

00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:22.034
He's not.

00:56:36.920 --> 00:56:39.230
Good. Switching cameras.

00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.192
Walking towards the bathroom.

00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.120
Okay, in the blind spot.

00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:00.194
I'm gonna keep walking.

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:01.999
Nothin'.

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:03.480
Nothin'.

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:06.233
Okay, you're right there.

00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.596
<i>Twelve feet. Nice job!</i>

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.354
Thank you, Nine Ball.

00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.751
That easy. Don't mention it.

00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.356
What's hard?

00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.154
- Hey.
- Oh, hi!

00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:33.875
Sorry, listen, I know this
really isn't any of my business...

00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.271
- No, go ahead.
- It's just a little red flag here.

00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.796
But this caterer doesn't have
a nutritional specialist.

00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:41.720
- Okay.
- And we're running at 20% special meals.

00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:43.997
Vegan, gluten-free, low sodium, lactose.

00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:46.438
I just... I had a client get sued.

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:47.636
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.553
I don't think we should wing any
of this stuff.

00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.599
I think we are short a staff person.
We need a nutritionist.

00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:54.439
<i>- I do know someone.
- You do?</i>

00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:57.394
<i>Yeah, and she's great.
She just moved here from Australia.</i>

00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:04.356
Yes.

00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:06.034
Okay. Go.

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.317
Vendor, hallway, hallway.
Past the auditorium.

00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.914
Hallway, hallway, hallway, entry.

00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:13.072
Hi, hi! I'm so sorry I'm late.
Traffic was horrible.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.593
Okay...

00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:20.679
- Amita.
- Thank you.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:22.240
Constance.

00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:24.635
Nine Ball.

00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.755
And Lou.

00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.712
And Rose.

00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.200
Thank you.

00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.516
- And Debbie.
- Thank you.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:37.995
<i>Hi, I'm Daphne Kluger,</i>

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:41.477
<i>and this is your sneak peek
of this year's Costume Institute.</i>

00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.599
This is Dolce
and that's Galliano for Dior.

00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:46.592
- And that is McQueen.
- Wow.

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.639
- And who's dressing you tomorrow?
- Hmm. Rose Weil.

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.556
- Interesting.
- I know.

00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:53.239
I kind of thought
it was an unexpected choice.

00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:54.830
What's this over here?

00:58:54.920 --> 00:58:58.596
So these are the crown jewels
from eight royal families of Europe.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.560
Which is probably why there's a moat.

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.956
- So we can't go over there?
- No. God, no.

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:04.679
I wish we could. Anyway...

00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:07.157
Uh, they are on loan to us from Dmitri

00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.836
Very-Long-Russian-Last-Name
that I can't pronounce.

00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.760
We hear those aren't
the only jewels that'll be on display.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.673
- Who told you?
- I have sources.

00:59:15.120 --> 00:59:17.794
Well, since the cat's
already out of the bag...

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:22.000
Yes, I will be wearing a necklace that
Cartier has decided to loan me.

00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.119
It's called the Toussaint,
and it has been in a vault for 50 years.

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.032
And I'm
just a little excited.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.391
- Have you tried it on already?
- Maybe.

00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:32.029
- How many carats is it?
- Enough.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.240
Hey.

01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:14.470
- Hey.
- Hmm?

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.553
- Lipstick. What do you think?
- Oh.

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.880
Pink. Um, yeah. Barbie.

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:21.430
In a good way.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:23.390
Thank you.

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.638
- It's here.
- Right. Finally. Great.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:33.190
All right.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.671
- Oh, you haven't seen it.
- No.

01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:38.793
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:46.992
Ooh. That's a big box.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.595
All right.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.354
Holy crap!

01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.794
Should we, uh...

01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.838
- Let's try it on. See if it fits.
- Okay.

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.798
- Can I, uh...
- Sure.

01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.030
Whoa.

01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:14.600
That's heavy.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.796
Really heavy.

01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:17.474
Come to mama.

01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.550
All right. It might be a little...

01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:22.876
Just a tad cold. Right.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.190
Ooh!

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:27.795
- Oh.
- All right. Okay.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.234
- Oh, wow.
- Let me see. Right.

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.360
That goes in.

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.800
Look at you.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.480
Yep. There.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.313
- It fits.
- Oh.

01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.030
All right.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.309
It fits.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.030
Right, okay.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.920
We can get it off,
and then we can try the frock.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.992
- Okay.
- Um, hang on.

01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.200
Oh!

01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:52.714
Sorry, you cannot do it.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.110
I have to do it.
It requires a special magnet.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.839
- What?
- Cool.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.749
- Uh... Special magnet?
- Yes.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:04.878
- Oh.
- That's cool.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.837
That's brilliant. Brilliant.

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:10.194
Amazing, um...

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:15.595
Can I just see that again,
out of interest?

01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.671
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.550
That's amazing.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.437
Great. Let me just see.
So how does it work?

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.435
Hilda Schneider,
fashion reporter, <i>Der Spiegel.</i>

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:29.510
No.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.359
- Hilda Schneider, diplomatic attaché?
- No.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.755
- Lufthansa asset?
- Lufthansa.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:33.910
Problem.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:36.595
- With?
- From Rose.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.598
Oh, God.

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.796
Come on!

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:43.999
<i>Oh, my God, that is amazing.
And you can only do it with a magnet?</i>

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:45.719
<i>- Only the magnet.
- Let me just see...</i>

01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:47.553
Stop. Play it again.

01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.632
<i>Oh, my God, that is amazing.
And you can only do it with a magnet?</i>

01:02:51.800 --> 01:02:53.792
<i>- Only the magnet.</i>
- Zoom in a little bit.

01:03:07.640 --> 01:03:09.393
What, Leslie? I'm busy.

01:03:09.560 --> 01:03:10.880
Leslie?

01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.958
Hey, sis, um, we're in a bit of a jam
right now, and I need your help.

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:21.511
So it seems like they used
poly-magnets and a spring.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.558
It gives you attraction and repulsion

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.439
<i>in the same axis, you know?</i>

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:28.240
- Not really.
<i>- Well, they're drawn together.</i>

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.997
But don't touch, until you rotate it,
and then they lock.

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.760
It's real dope.
I'll go get you a positive

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:39.470
<i>and a negative pole in a loop.
That oughta work fine.</i>

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.479
You're a little genius, sis. Thank you.

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:43.994
Really? She fixed it?

01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:45.640
Really? You just asked me that?

01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.071
Okay, you guys. Sound check.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:02.511
- Nine Ball.
- Check.

01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.034
- Debbie.
- Check.

01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:06.032
- Constance.
- Yeah.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.316
- Amita.
- Yep.

01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.914
- Lou.
- Check.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.755
That shit was hectic.
Got chased by a cop!

01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.711
Okay, so this is my sister, everyone,
Veronica.

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.440
Check this out. Crazy.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:39.795
Tight. All right.
I owe you one, you little shit.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:41.394
Just get me a new ID.

01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:42.960
Go home.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.959
What do your parents do?

01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:50.795
Okay, we are up.
Is everybody on?

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.314
<i>- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.437
All right, ladies. Half an hour.

01:04:54.600 --> 01:04:56.512
Countdown starting now.

01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:01.954
Okay. First.
No need to be nervous.

01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:05.276
The food is better on the inside
than most people think,

01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:06.589
and even solitary

01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.399
can be kind of peaceful.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.271
I just wanna say, thank you.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:24.790
The last three weeks
have been amazing for me

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.520
and we've all worked very hard
for this moment.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.798
So, whatever happens tonight,
I want you to remember one thing...

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:34.997
You are not doing this for me.

01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.632
You are not doing this for you.

01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:41.473
Somewhere out there
is an eight-year-old girl

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.598
lying in bed,
dreaming of being a criminal.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:49.073
Let's do this for her.

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.870
Do not engage in informal conversation
with the guests, please.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.593
Do not have your cell phone on you.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.552
Please make sure your cell phone
is turned in to security

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:59.034
prior to the start of the event.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:00.270
Very important.

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.717
Do not slouch, cross your arms,
put your hands in your pockets.

01:06:03.800 --> 01:06:05.757
I know it's gonna be a long night.
I know you're gonna get tired...

01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.352
- Hello.
- Hello. How are you?

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:26.113
Edward, so good to see you.
Claude Becker.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:28.237
- Pleasure.
- And, of course, Rose Weil.

01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:30.198
- You two know each other?
- Yes.

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:32.357
My dear, is that the Toussaint?

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.478
I'd say you look like a million bucks,
but it's more like 100 million.

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.791
Thank you, it's 150 million actually.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.117
What inspired you for tonight's look?

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:45.070
Her.

01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:05.672
Unreal. So what makes this
such a fun night?

01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.479
I mean, you never know
who you're gonna see.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.120
It's like,
stars from all over the planet.

01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.113
Meeting actors,
people in the fashion industry.

01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:17.400
So, coming up next,
we have Serena Williams.

01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:19.711
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:20.916
I'm good, thank you.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.276
So, you've conquered the court,
you've conquered motherhood...

01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.591
- I'm trying.
- I mean, you are succeeding.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:28.275
Sorry, we're a little backed up today.
Your name?

01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.158
Uh, Hilda Schneider.

01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:32.993
Oh, here it is. Have a good night.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.160
Here, Heidi! Heidi!

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:16.518
Yes. Ready for tonight?

01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:29.393
- Hi, how are you?
- Nice to see you! Fantastic.

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:49.870
Ready to sit.

01:08:56.160 --> 01:08:57.640
- Hot sauce?
- Hot sauce.

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.276
- You good?
- Yeah. I'll see you soon?

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:35.271
Hey, no, we're closed.

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.030
We're closed.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:40.830
Come on, dude. It's right there.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:50.359
Yeah, I got her.

01:09:51.080 --> 01:09:52.400
Yeah, I see her.

01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:55.480
We're a go.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:00.400
Hi, everybody.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.835
- Hi.
- How are you?

01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.559
Hi. Good to see you.

01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.797
It's so good to see you.
You look amazing.

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.077
- You too. Cheers.
- Oh, yeah, cheers.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.671
No, no, these are real.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.200
Thank you very much. So kind of you.

01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:27.959
Okay, counting down.

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.435
Three, two, one.

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.109
Need a gluten-free
and a broiled fish for Table Eight.

01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:39.560
Where's the vegan for Table Four?

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:41.034
Over here.

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.115
Go, go, go.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:06.553
Oh, thank God!

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:13.590
Mmm.

01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.512
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.234
I'm so hungry.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:20.915
Mmm.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.071
I haven't eaten anything in three days.
I'm just like...

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.396
I'm sorry.

01:11:25.080 --> 01:11:26.116
Mmm.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.955
Am I being rude?

01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:31.075
She's in deep.

01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:33.230
Maybe half a bowl.

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.153
So, you're supposed to curtsy.

01:11:53.320 --> 01:11:56.074
They actually have a guy there
to teach you how to curtsy.

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:57.560
Yes, that's true.

01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.599
Anyway, I go in,
I'm doing this little knee bend.

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:04.151
And the Queen glares at me and says,
"That's not a curtsy."

01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:05.230
Really?

01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:09.149
So now, I am in a curtsy standoff
with the Queen of England.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.560
And...

01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:13.956
Are you okay?

01:12:14.520 --> 01:12:16.751
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.276
- Do you need to go to the bathroom?
- No.

01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:19.396
- I'm fine.
- Are you sure?

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:22.319
I'm at this curtsy standoff
with Queen...

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:25.440
- And she's...
- Are you okay? Do you need help?

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.319
I'm fine. Just give me one second,
hold on. I just need to get this...

01:12:29.680 --> 01:12:30.909
You all right?

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.839
Game on!

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.800
Excuse me, we need to...

01:13:11.400 --> 01:13:12.436
That's good.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.276
Okay, you're right on
the edge of the blind spot.

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.317
Hey, you all right?

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.797
You good? Oh, you poor thing.

01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.279
It's okay. You'll be okay.
Breathe, breathe.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.597
Breathe. Breathe.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.080
Breathe.

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:36.675
Okay, 10 seconds.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:37.876
Here we go.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:40.914
Hey, come here.

01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.510
This can't be here.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.000
You need to get this
into the kitchen right away.

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:46.077
- No problem.
- Okay, go. Go, go.

01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.430
Coming at you, Deb.

01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:48.920
Okay, here he comes.

01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.470
Oh.

01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:04.839
Okay, my mule is out.

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.758
All my ladies still in the dark.

01:14:10.160 --> 01:14:12.755
- Dude. Dude.
- Yo.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.073
- You have it?
- Have what?

01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:17.360
Oh, I smoked it.

01:14:17.520 --> 01:14:18.670
What do you mean, "smoked it"?

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.639
You know, Josh asked,
and he was like, "Hey, do you have..."

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.553
Guys, where is he? What's wrong?

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.350
What's happening?

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:28.155
Stalled in the hallway. Chitchattin'.

01:14:28.720 --> 01:14:29.915
<i>Tammy, you got
to get him moving now.</i>

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:38.993
I'm putting the soup down, I'm like...

01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:41.112
Hey! Hey, what the hell
are you guys doing?

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:42.714
You're not getting paid to talk.

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:44.712
- Let's go, come on.
- Yeah, sorry.

01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.673
Here, I'll take those.
I'll take those.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.195
Thanks.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.716
Bathroom break. Bathroom break!.

01:15:58.160 --> 01:15:59.389
That was intense.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:04.234
What?

01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.798
I don't know.
It could've fallen off in there.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.314
It could've fallen off back there.
I'm not sure.

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:22.914
I was just barfing my guts out.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:24.878
I was back at the table the whole time.

01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.356
Seal the exits.

01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:29.796
What? No. Do we have to make
such a big deal about this? Come on.

01:16:29.880 --> 01:16:32.270
- You better lock it up.
- Oh, come on!

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.552
- We need to clear the room.
- You can't do that.

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.359
We need to do a full sweep.

01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.510
We can't.

01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:39.394
Do you know who's here?

01:16:39.480 --> 01:16:41.756
You just lost $150 million.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.514
What would you do
if it was a Rembrandt missing, hmm?

01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:47.429
Dinner will resume shortly, I promise!

01:16:47.520 --> 01:16:49.034
Thank you so much
for your understanding.

01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:50.679
Just walk towards the stairs.

01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:55.480
Sealin' the exits.

01:16:58.920 --> 01:17:00.877
Gentlemen,
we're working in teams of two.

01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:02.997
We start at the perimeter
and work our way in.

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.395
Once you've been scanned

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.597
please go directly to the exit.

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.797
There will be someone there
that will show you where to go.

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.750
Do you know
what's going on here?

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:21.354
An item seems to have been lost.

01:17:21.520 --> 01:17:22.590
They're looking for it now.

01:17:22.760 --> 01:17:24.353
- Do you know what they lost?
- Diamonds.

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:26.435
Lots of diamonds.

01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:28.239
Diamonds? Really?
We're waiting around for diamonds?

01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.232
Sir, I really just need to go
to the bathroom.

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.559
Okay, shit's blowing up.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:38.157
Police coming, Cartier coming.

01:17:38.640 --> 01:17:40.233
A bunch of news people coming.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:42.070
Yeah.

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.709
Yeah, they're doing it.

01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:45.920
They're about halfway through.

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.231
Was there anything you did
or anyone you talked to

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:49.834
between your table and the bathroom?

01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:53.277
I was rather preoccupied at the time,
in case you didn't notice.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:04.118
Amita, there's a guy in the kitchen.

01:18:04.520 --> 01:18:06.000
<i>Just give it a few more minutes.</i>

01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.919
We don't have a few minutes.

01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.390
Oh, shit!

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.074
<i>He's right there.</i>

01:18:17.160 --> 01:18:18.230
<i>Tammy, how close?
Where are you now?</i>

01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:19.310
By the moat.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.998
Tammy, pull it out of the water.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.317
Just plant it in the water!
Just pull it out, right now!

01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:31.756
Found it!

01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.599
It was in the water.

01:18:34.680 --> 01:18:36.319
It must have fallen off
while you were running.

01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:37.670
May I?

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:38.796
We got it back.

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.158
Okay. I'll come back down.

01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.277
Constance, you good.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.399
Whoa, sick!

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.353
Uh-uh. There's glue,
there's glue, there's glue!

01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:24.710
Feeling better?

01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:26.315
I do now.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:03.274
Couple Scotches, please.

01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.353
Dear God!

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:37.870
Thank you.

01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:38.950
Oh.

01:22:40.360 --> 01:22:41.635
Very nice.

01:22:43.720 --> 01:22:44.710
<i>First of all,</i>

01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:47.952
I'm not a member of law enforcement.
I work with the insurance carrier.

01:22:48.120 --> 01:22:51.477
Which means I'm either looking for fraud
or I'm looking for the real necklace.

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:53.279
Beyond that, I couldn't care less.

01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.070
I'm afraid you won't find either here.

01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:58.556
We'll see about that, <i>Monsieur...</i>

01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:02.310
<i>- Monsieur?</i>
- Delarue-Broussard.

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:03.830
Okay.

01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.474
Lawrence, when did you last see

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:07.916
what you believe
to be the authentic item?

01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.719
When it left here for the Met Gala.

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.400
When did you know this was a fake?

01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:13.040
The moment it was returned.

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.270
And you two.

01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:17.475
You had your eyes on the necklace
the entire evening?

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:19.035
Apart from when Ms. Kluger had

01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:20.918
her unfortunate incident
in the public toilet.

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.116
That's correct.

01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:23.759
Did you accompany her inside?

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:25.355
It's a women's bathroom.

01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.710
It's a very big necklace.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.439
There is only one entrance in and out.

01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:30.080
We were stationed at the door.

01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.433
Did you check the plumbing?

01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:33.989
- No.
- I did.

01:23:34.720 --> 01:23:36.040
Okay, keep going forward.

01:23:40.360 --> 01:23:43.239
Squeaky clean, so to speak.

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:48.238
Whoever stole this necklace...

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.114
Managed to get out
without being detected.

01:23:53.520 --> 01:23:55.671
Which means we're looking
for someone very smart.

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:56.990
Gentlemen.

01:23:57.560 --> 01:24:01.076
I've seen a thoroughbred racehorse
thrown into a tree shredder.

01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:05.031
People will go to great lengths
to defraud an insurance carrier.

01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.629
There! What's this?

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.473
I'm saying that's not a blind spot.

01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:13.518
- What do you call that then?
- The bathroom.

01:24:14.400 --> 01:24:15.390
I don't see a bathroom.

01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:17.995
- That's...
- Because it's in the blind spot.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.835
What can someone steal
from a bathroom anyway?

01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:22.559
I don't know, toiletries,

01:24:22.720 --> 01:24:24.552
mints, hand towels,

01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:27.519
a six-pound diamond necklace,
apparently.

01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:28.910
Now, who's this?

01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.030
The busboy?

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:31.190
Do you know him?

01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:33.158
How would I know a busboy?

01:24:33.440 --> 01:24:34.476
Aren't we posh?

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:37.758
I don't know everyone who goes
in and out of the museum.

01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:39.035
Why do you care about a busboy?

01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:41.430
He's the only person who moves
in and out of the blind spot

01:24:41.520 --> 01:24:42.510
during the period in question.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:44.637
Could you please
stop calling it a blind spot?

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.390
Fine.

01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:49.758
The bathroom door that we can't see

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.156
because of your unique camera placement.

01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.030
This is the most sophisticated
museum security in the world.

01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:58.431
Every piece of art is recorded
from multiple angles.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:01.593
We just don't happen to keep art
in the bathroom.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.714
I'm not a critic, Kyle.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:05.919
I'm an insurance investigator.

01:25:06.560 --> 01:25:07.880
I didn't wanna do it.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.753
But Eric's all, like, "Come on!"

01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.832
I'm, like,
"Dude, I don't do that anymore."

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.271
He's, like,
"Everyone's out on the loading dock!"

01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:16.033
I know it was really stupid.

01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:17.954
I know I'm an asshole

01:25:19.080 --> 01:25:20.400
but it wasn't even my weed.

01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:23.870
I'm sorry, what?

01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:27.078
It wasn't my weed! Do you want me
to pee in a cup or something?

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.799
No, that won't be necessary.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.553
- Are you sure? I really don't mind.
- I'm positive.

01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:32.313
They put the necklace on me.

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.352
Then I walked the red carpet.

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:35.994
Then I saw the exhibit.

01:25:36.160 --> 01:25:37.913
Then I ate my soup.

01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.400
Then I hurled my guts out.

01:25:39.560 --> 01:25:40.676
Then the necklace was gone.

01:25:40.840 --> 01:25:42.433
And then everybody freaked out.

01:25:42.600 --> 01:25:45.320
And then they found it again, I thought.

01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:46.630
But, no?

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:48.470
This gentleman.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:50.914
- Claude Becker.
- Mm-hmm.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:53.871
He was my date.

01:25:54.440 --> 01:25:58.480
Was there ever a time you two were alone
while you were wearing the necklace?

01:26:04.320 --> 01:26:05.310
No.

01:26:06.560 --> 01:26:08.279
Anyone present with you in the bathroom?

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.636
My head was in a toilet bowl.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:12.790
How 'bout after?

01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:14.236
A lot of people.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:16.634
Do you know this woman?

01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.957
- No.
- Debbie Ocean, convicted felon.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:23.440
Her brother, Danny Ocean,

01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:24.750
more convicted felon.

01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:27.435
She was present on
the night of the incident.

01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:28.989
Did she steal the necklace?

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:31.476
Apparently not,
she's the only one with an alibi.

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.677
Smiling at the camera the entire time.

01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:36.037
Ooh, so...

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:39.358
So, I have five innocent people
who seem to be suspects

01:26:39.520 --> 01:26:41.910
and someone who should be a suspect
but isn't.

01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:43.995
I have cameras

01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:46.676
covering every inch of the museum

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.274
except for the loo,

01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:53.199
where $150 million was stolen
from that neck, your neck.

01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:55.520
- Interesting case.
- Mmm.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.920
Some days, I love my job.

01:26:58.080 --> 01:27:00.072
I love my job, too.

01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:27.833
You guys are fucked.

01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:29.910
Nice place.

01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.990
It must be a bitch to heat.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:33.753
Excuse me! You are trespassing.

01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.797
No. We asked her to come.

01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:37.280
You asked her to come?

01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:39.756
Oh.

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.077
We realized a few days ago
that Ms. Kluger...

01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:44.072
Was not a total fricking idiot.

01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:46.880
Might have gotten a sense
of what we were doing.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:54.600
You've got one of the greatest necks
in the world.

01:27:54.760 --> 01:27:56.114
<i>First of all,
if there's one thing</i>

01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.520
<i>I know, it's bad acting.</i>

01:27:57.600 --> 01:28:00.832
In fact, you've got the only neck
that could carry this necklace off.

01:28:02.280 --> 01:28:03.680
<i>And I almost never throw up.</i>

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.156
Even when I'm really wasted.

01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:08.880
It was in the water. It must have
fallen off while you were running.

01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.752
<i>And last but not least,</i>

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:16.194
<i>I never forget a face.</i>

01:28:16.280 --> 01:28:17.396
<i>Debbie Ocean.</i>

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.149
Yeah. Yeah.

01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:24.950
So, seems to me,
eight shares of 150 million

01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:27.919
is better than
seven shares of nothing, right?

01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:30.555
Chilly!

01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:33.599
Hi, Daph! Welcome to the team!
Let's not all high-five at once.

01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:36.150
Plus, I am the one
who is saving your asses

01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:37.754
- from insurance fraud.
- What?

01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.673
- Insurance fraud?
- I was gonna get to that.

01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:40.750
When?

01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:43.395
It seems that they've assigned
an insurance investigator...

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.517
Who's about to look up your ass
with a flashlight.

01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:47.637
- Who?
- Oh, this little <i>Columbo</i> dude,

01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:49.832
everything but the trench coat.
Totally on to you.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:51.753
His name is John Frazier.

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:52.956
- You know him?
- Yes.

01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:54.793
He busted my father twice
and my brother once.

01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:57.191
- He's family.
- All right. Lest we forget,

01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:59.875
this entire enterprise
was to keep me out of jail.

01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.474
Hey. No one's going to jail.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:02.960
- Are you sure?
- We expected this.

01:29:03.400 --> 01:29:04.436
We prepared for this.

01:29:04.520 --> 01:29:06.273
Yup, that's clear.

01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:09.519
We will not be the prime suspect.

01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.319
Okay, who will be the prime suspect?

01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:13.517
Well, there's a few.
We've got the security guys,

01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:16.798
- we've got the busboys...
- The shady guy who put you away.

01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:21.157
Wow!

01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:22.670
The boyfriend.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:26.000
<i>Yup. They were gonna be
looking for somebody.</i>

01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:28.596
Just had to make sure
it wasn't one of us.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.950
It's nice.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:32.270
Thanks.

01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:35.191
That is amazing! The precision...

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.270
Right?

01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:38.750
It's always the attention to detail
and the little grace notes

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:41.480
that really make something sing.

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:44.439
Why are you doing this?

01:29:45.120 --> 01:29:46.236
Uh...

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:51.440
I don't have that many close
female friendships.

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.915
And book clubs are the worst.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.633
So, I just thought, you know...

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:56.590
This could be something fun to share.

01:29:56.760 --> 01:29:58.797
You're becoming a criminal
because you're lonely?

01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:02.192
Who isn't sometimes, right?

01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:04.000
Are you an only child?

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.396
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>
in Miami?

01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.596
It's Shakespeare.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:13.114
She did summer stock at Williamstown,

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:14.555
plus a bunch of off-Broadway.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:15.955
What about this one? She looks good.

01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.952
Let's see. Regional theater

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.759
<i>but she trained at Juilliard.</i>

01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:21.877
It's really a magnificent piece.
This was your mother's?

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:24.111
Left to me after her passing.

01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:26.591
A Swedish prince gave it to her

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:30.039
in exchange for her deflowering.

01:30:30.320 --> 01:30:31.834
Are they worth something?

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.912
- Yes, they're worth quite a lot.
- Oh.

01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:37.152
"Take these," my mother said. "Now, go."

01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:38.470
It was moonlight...

01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:40.554
And then he said,

01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:44.318
"I'd give you every star in that sky."

01:30:45.240 --> 01:30:46.310
I'm sorry.

01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.199
It must be difficult for you.

01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:54.754
- Claude Becker?
- Yeah.

01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:55.956
- John Frazier.
- Hi.

01:30:56.040 --> 01:30:58.077
SPD Insurance. How are you?

01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:00.952
So, Claude...

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.032
Like Jean-Claude Van Damme.

01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:05.796
Isn't it?

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:06.996
What do you want?

01:31:07.160 --> 01:31:11.632
Here are some photographs of you
with Ms. Kluger.

01:31:11.800 --> 01:31:13.359
Now, as you can see,
there are many photographs

01:31:13.520 --> 01:31:15.910
where your hand
is on the back of her neck.

01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:18.072
I don't really remember
where my hands were.

01:31:18.200 --> 01:31:19.190
Ah...

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:20.630
To be you.

01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:21.830
Right?

01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:24.390
Problem is...

01:31:24.800 --> 01:31:27.998
The necklace has been stolen
and a fake has been put in its place.

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:29.913
Right now, you're the person
with the greatest opportunity...

01:31:30.080 --> 01:31:31.434
Why would I wanna steal a necklace?

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:34.398
That's what I keep asking myself.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:37.074
Why would this guy...

01:31:39.360 --> 01:31:40.874
Who's got everything...

01:31:42.200 --> 01:31:43.429
Two of these.

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.636
Why would that guy
wanna steal a necklace?

01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.160
And what was your answer?

01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:54.593
Maybe he doesn't have everything.

01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:56.710
I think we're done here.

01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:58.120
- Just a theory.
- Really.

01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.270
- A shot in the dark.
- We're done.

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.510
I'm probably wrong.

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:03.115
It's a beautiful piece,
and I want you to have it.

01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:06.156
I can't go any lower.
Just hold on one second.

01:32:08.480 --> 01:32:09.470
Hello?

01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:12.872
- Oh, hey.
- Hi.

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:14.994
What are you doing right now?

01:32:22.800 --> 01:32:23.916
Hello, John.

01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:25.275
Hello, Debbie.

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.993
You look well, how long's it been?

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.959
A few years. Minus good behavior.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:31.440
- Right.
- Yeah.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.717
Thank you for calling.
I was gonna call you.

01:32:33.880 --> 01:32:35.712
- Yeah, I didn't do it.
- Of course not.

01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:38.554
You were just on camera 20 feet away
while the jewels were being nicked.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:39.870
It's a coincidence.

01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.759
No. That's a solid alibi.

01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:44.833
What is it? Is it genetic?
Are the whole family like this?

01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:46.116
Except for my Aunt Ida.

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:48.272
- Librarian?
- Mmm. Homemaker.

01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:51.319
Right, I'm gonna make this easy for you.
I don't want you.

01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:54.115
I just want the necklace.

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:55.919
I don't care.
I'll say I found it in a cab.

01:32:56.080 --> 01:32:57.480
How about some of it?

01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:02.673
- How much?
- Hypothetically, 10%.

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:04.514
And where's the hypothetical rest?

01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:07.360
Oh, I don't know. Literally.

01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:10.396
Oh, God. This is exhausting!

01:33:10.640 --> 01:33:13.155
I mean, when they said come over,
I was like... Ugh...

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:16.751
You know, with the jet lag,
the time difference.

01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.593
Arsenal in the Cup Final this weekend.

01:33:18.680 --> 01:33:20.399
But now I'm here.
It's bloody interesting.

01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:21.550
Yeah?

01:33:27.160 --> 01:33:30.995
So, it's not just profit, it's revenge.
It's a twofer.

01:33:32.520 --> 01:33:34.796
He frames you, you frame him,
scores are settled.

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:35.990
I'm just the courier.

01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:38.231
All is right with the world,
it's brilliant.

01:33:39.320 --> 01:33:40.800
Just trying to help out an old friend.

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.993
You know, one day,
you are gonna have to let this go?

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:45.958
And one day, I will.

01:33:47.520 --> 01:33:50.592
Let's just say, for argument's sake,

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:53.676
that I do know where
there's a part of that necklace.

01:33:55.040 --> 01:33:56.554
Can you get a search warrant?

01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.878
I'd need probable cause.

01:34:01.400 --> 01:34:05.360
Well, we may or may not be
working on that right now.

01:34:09.480 --> 01:34:11.199
Do you wanna play a game?

01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:14.320
What kind of game?

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:17.720
A card game.

01:34:20.520 --> 01:34:22.159
- Uh...
- Uh-huh.

01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:26.356
- Uh-huh.
- Yes, yes!

01:34:35.280 --> 01:34:36.555
I'll be right back.

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.439
Where are you going?

01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:40.510
Wait.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:01.516
Where are you?

01:35:02.280 --> 01:35:04.272
I'll be right there.

01:36:11.240 --> 01:36:14.551
You have no idea how this
came to be in your possession?

01:36:14.840 --> 01:36:15.956
No.

01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:21.912
But you were Ms. Kluger's date the night
these necklaces were switched.

01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.229
Yes, I was.

01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.000
Does that strike you
as a rather large coincidence?

01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:35.990
Including a 33.18, D color,
internally flawless diamond...

01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:37.799
<i>Are you familiar
with a company called</i>

01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.837
<i>Becker Holdings, LLC?</i>

01:36:40.040 --> 01:36:41.235
<i>Of course.</i>

01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:44.239
<i>Well, it seems
four sweet old ladies,</i>

01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.397
<i>who apparently don't exist,</i>

01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:50.478
<i>have recently transferred
some very large sums of money</i>

01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:53.474
<i>into Becker Holdings, LLC.</i>

01:36:56.160 --> 01:36:58.720
<i>Do you know how that
might have happened, Mr. Becker?</i>

01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:06.679
I think I need to talk to my lawyer.

01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:09.440
I think you do.

01:37:17.480 --> 01:37:19.358
- To our dear friend Carl...
- Claude.

01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:23.957
Claude Becker.
May he rest in peace in prison.

01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:26.595
- Cheers.
- Love you, love you, love you.

01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.790
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.155
I have a question.

01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.430
So...

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.072
It's good that he went to jail,
'cause it's great that we didn't.

01:37:35.920 --> 01:37:40.199
But if you only sold the jewels
for 85 million,

01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:42.312
how does it work out
that we get 16 apiece?

01:37:45.240 --> 01:37:46.435
Do you wanna?

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:48.796
You thought we were just gonna steal
one necklace?

01:37:49.240 --> 01:37:51.277
What do you think we are,
a bunch of pussies?

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.274
<i>See, while everyone
was worried about</i>

01:37:54.360 --> 01:37:55.555
<i>what was happening around your neck...</i>

01:37:55.760 --> 01:37:57.672
<i>And you were hurling
your guts out...</i>

01:37:57.760 --> 01:37:58.750
<i>Thanks for that, by the way.</i>

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:00.710
It was amazing.

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.069
That was really impressive.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.356
That was really nice, actually.

01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.790
The place
kinda went on lockdown.

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.919
<i>The kitchen was cleared out, too.</i>

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:10.834
<i>And while everyone
was watching the entrance,</i>

01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.430
<i>we thought we'd check out the exhibit.</i>

01:38:15.200 --> 01:38:17.954
Because why would you
just steal one necklace,

01:38:20.360 --> 01:38:23.080
when you could steal more?

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:26.155
Holy shit!

01:38:26.320 --> 01:38:28.596
- That's a lot.
- Yeah.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:31.673
We didn't just print the Toussaint
from that thing.

01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.394
<i>We printed a lot ofjewels.</i>

01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.239
<i>Felt like I was working
at Kinko's.</i>

01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:37.510
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:40.439
<i>I decided to visit an old friend.</i>

01:38:49.160 --> 01:38:51.914
<i>Amazon sells
these 20-foot selfie sticks.</i>

01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:55.474
<i>All they saw was a quick, little blur.</i>

01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.150
<i>It was a temporary exhibit</i>

01:39:00.280 --> 01:39:01.794
<i>and they built this metal grid
to hang the dresses from.</i>

01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:06.792
<i>We just decided to suspend
Yen from that as well.</i>

01:39:26.520 --> 01:39:28.079
What if somebody came in?

01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:29.470
Oh, somebody did.

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.109
I'm sorry, ma'am, you can't be here.
We're clearing this whole area.

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:13.870
Ma'am.

01:40:16.160 --> 01:40:17.150
Calm down.

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:34.119
We're okay.

01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:11.797
<i>Stealing the necklace was great,</i>

01:41:12.080 --> 01:41:15.073
but without that diversion,
without clearing out the exhibit...

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.674
We wouldn't have been
able to grab these.

01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:18.190
These...

01:41:18.440 --> 01:41:23.993
Which bring your cuts
to $38,300,000 each.

01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:25.070
- Huh?
- Yeah.

01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:43.390
Yeah.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:48.275
Yeah, I know. It's so beautiful.

01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:04.953
Sweetie, I know, but you can't put gum
in your sister's hair.

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.680
I don't care if she tried to put it
in your nose first.

01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:24.752
What's up, YouTube? It's your girl!
Check out my new crib.

01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:26.638
I'm on the co-op board.

01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.994
- Cut!
- That's a cut!

01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:35.436
That's a cut!

01:42:36.480 --> 01:42:37.960
Resetting back to one.

01:42:38.120 --> 01:42:39.873
Uh, just, you know... Smoother.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.396
Just a little bit of space, please.
It was perfect.

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:45.080
I just need it faster and more damaged.
All right? Great.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:47.320
It's not that hard!

01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:06.754
You would've loved it.
