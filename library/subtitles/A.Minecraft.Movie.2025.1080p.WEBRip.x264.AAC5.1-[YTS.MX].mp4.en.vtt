00:10:23.056 --> 00:10:25.191
Think I come to storage auctions
for fun?

00:10:25.892 --> 00:10:27.193
I'm a businessman, Daryl.

00:10:27.227 --> 00:10:29.095
An investor.

00:10:29.129 --> 00:10:31.664
Well, I'm about to shovel some
coal into your choo-choo train.

00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:33.800
You're gonna love
this next unit.

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:35.969
It's got a waterbed.

00:10:36.002 --> 00:10:37.937
It's got some pickaxes.

00:10:37.971 --> 00:10:41.908
It's got a huge can
of mixed nuts.

00:10:41.941 --> 00:10:46.012
It's got an array
of unisex turquoise blouses.

00:10:46.045 --> 00:10:47.347
That sounds terrible.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.884
I think it's also got
a 1978 Atari Cosmos.

00:10:50.917 --> 00:10:54.154
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
1978 Atari Cosmos?

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:55.722
That's what it says here.

00:10:55.755 --> 00:10:57.157
Those things are worth
a frickin' fortune.

00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:58.458
Heck, yeah, they are.

00:10:58.491 --> 00:11:01.060
Bro,
if you make this happen for me,

00:11:01.094 --> 00:11:03.696
I will strongly consider
hanging out with you.

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:06.199
- You serious, bro?
- Yep.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:11.037
Two big buffaloes like us
out there, in the wild,

00:11:11.070 --> 00:11:14.274
wearing unisex
turquoise blouses.

00:11:14.974 --> 00:11:16.910
Oh, boy,
that's gonna cause a commotion.

00:11:16.943 --> 00:11:18.745
The ladies aren't
gonna know what...

00:11:18.778 --> 00:11:21.014
Listen, if you could keep
the hammer price under a hundy,

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.149
I'll make all your weird
fanboy dreams come true.

00:11:23.383 --> 00:11:24.184
Okay?

00:11:25.885 --> 00:11:28.922
Two loose cannons,
wearing turquoise blouses.

00:11:28.955 --> 00:11:31.224
Yeah. Let's do it.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:33.960
[Daryl] And we got 500 dollars,
500 dollars over here.

00:11:33.993 --> 00:11:36.129
We got 500 dollars.
We got six, do we have six?

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.264
Do we have 600 dollars?
We got 600 dollars over here.

00:11:38.298 --> 00:11:41.034
I'll go over here, 700 dollars,
we got 700 dollars.

00:11:41.067 --> 00:11:42.936
We got 700 dollars here.
We got 800 dollars over here.

00:11:42.969 --> 00:11:44.470
- [sighs]
- We got 850. Do we hear 850?

00:11:44.505 --> 00:11:46.239
Do we... 850 over here.

00:11:46.272 --> 00:11:48.141
Do we hear any more?
Do we hear 900? 900?

00:11:48.174 --> 00:11:50.310
Nine hundred, going once,
900 going twice.

00:11:50.343 --> 00:11:51.911
And 900 going three times.

00:11:51.945 --> 00:11:54.515
And sold to hometown hero,

00:11:54.548 --> 00:11:57.383
Garrett "The Garbage Man"
Garrison, for 900 dollars.

00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.422
[Garrett] I wouldn't cash that
for about six months.

00:12:02.455 --> 00:12:03.456
What?

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:07.126
[whoops] Come to papa! Cosmos!

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.328
Whoo! [blows]

[orb chiming softly]

00:12:19.038 --> 00:12:20.541
[Garrett] Daryl? Where is it?

00:12:20.574 --> 00:12:22.175
I'm sorry.
I didn't check the box.

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.378
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- [Garrett] Where's the Atari?

00:12:25.411 --> 00:12:27.280
- Whoa!
- There's no Atari in here!

00:12:27.313 --> 00:12:29.949
That does not mean
you can trash this unit!

00:12:29.983 --> 00:12:30.984
[Garret grunts loudly]

00:12:31.017 --> 00:12:32.885
I'm up against it, man, I'm...

00:12:32.919 --> 00:12:34.555
[panting]

00:12:34.588 --> 00:12:37.357
Oh, no. My store.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.926
My wrists aren't
what they used to be. I just...

00:12:39.959 --> 00:12:42.428
[panting]

00:12:42.462 --> 00:12:44.230
I need a win, man. I need...

00:12:45.098 --> 00:12:46.567
I need a win.

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.134
When are you gonna stop
looking for treasure

00:12:48.167 --> 00:12:50.036
inside a storage unit...

00:12:50.571 --> 00:12:53.540
and recognize
that the real treasure...

00:12:54.274 --> 00:12:56.009
...is inside your heart?

00:12:57.611 --> 00:12:59.012
[sighs deeply]

00:12:59.045 --> 00:13:00.813
[Daryl] Let's roll, everyone.

00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.316
This man has no respect
for the storage community.

00:13:06.185 --> 00:13:07.521
Daryl.

00:13:11.592 --> 00:13:12.825

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.481

00:13:36.015 --> 00:13:40.053
[screaming]

00:13:44.157 --> 00:13:47.060
Look, Chuglass
was not my first choice either,

00:13:47.093 --> 00:13:49.462
but it was Mom's dying wish
for us to live here.

00:13:50.463 --> 00:13:52.031
Or at least
that's how I interpreted it.

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:54.167
Yeah, I read something online.

00:13:54.467 --> 00:13:55.968
This place sucks.

00:13:56.002 --> 00:13:57.870
Anyways, rent is super low,

00:13:57.904 --> 00:13:59.405
and I've got
a full-time gig here,

00:13:59.439 --> 00:14:02.075
so it's not really an offer
we can turn down right now.

00:14:02.509 --> 00:14:04.110
[boy] Yeah, I get it.

00:14:04.143 --> 00:14:06.179
Look, I think you're really
gonna like it here.

00:14:08.281 --> 00:14:09.616
What's going on with that dude?

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.951
[screaming and sobbing]

00:14:15.488 --> 00:14:18.224
[girl] Oh, my gosh, Henry,
we're in Chuglass.

00:14:18.257 --> 00:14:19.959
Say hi to Chuggy the Chip.

00:14:26.432 --> 00:14:29.102
[girl] All right.
This is the new neighborhood.

00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:30.436
[Henry]
When was this house built?

00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:33.640
[laughing]
It's so nice to meet you.

00:14:33.674 --> 00:14:35.108
Yeah, nice to meet you.

00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.210
Uh, your new bosses
sent you this.

00:14:37.243 --> 00:14:38.945
Oh...

00:14:38.978 --> 00:14:41.914
Yeah, people love working
at the potato chip factory.

00:14:41.948 --> 00:14:43.449
Yeah, well, I'm, uh,

00:14:43.483 --> 00:14:45.151
I'm running their socials
for a little bit.

00:14:45.184 --> 00:14:47.253
I said I'd get
their follower count past 75.

00:14:47.286 --> 00:14:49.489
Nice! You must be Henry.

00:14:49.523 --> 00:14:51.424
Nice to meet you. I'm Dawn.

00:14:51.457 --> 00:14:54.093
Hi. Why is there an alpaca
hanging out of your car?

00:14:55.128 --> 00:14:57.330
[Dawn] Well, real estate's
not my only hustle.

00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.600
I also do some mobile zoo stuff
on the side.

00:14:59.633 --> 00:15:01.535
Anyhoo, I gotta run.

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.202
Call me if you need anything.

00:15:04.538 --> 00:15:08.274
Also...
I'm really sorry about your mom.

00:15:08.307 --> 00:15:10.243
It's really brave
what you're doing.

00:15:10.276 --> 00:15:11.377
I hope you know that.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:14.046
Thank you.

00:15:15.682 --> 00:15:18.985

- Chill out, man. I'm coming.

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:20.453
Golly!

Check it out.

00:16:02.729 --> 00:16:06.132
I made you Mom's signature
Tater Tot breakfast pizza.

00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:08.635
So you can hand out slices
on your first day.

00:16:08.669 --> 00:16:10.637
I thought you wanted me
to seem normal.

00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:11.705
I do.

00:16:11.738 --> 00:16:13.239
I'm just trying to help you out.

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.642
I got you some body spray.

00:16:15.676 --> 00:16:18.010
Signature scents are huge here.

00:16:18.311 --> 00:16:20.012
[Henry] Velvet Mischief?

00:16:20.046 --> 00:16:21.548
You're gonna want to spray it
and then walk into it.

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:23.483
Don't be too direct.
It's really powerful.

00:16:24.116 --> 00:16:25.652
- Okay.
- Love you.

00:16:26.352 --> 00:16:27.554
Love you, too. [sniffs]

[Henry]
Your store's really cool.

00:17:04.123 --> 00:17:05.592
Yeah, I know.

00:17:05.626 --> 00:17:07.594
Looking for anything
in particular?

00:17:07.628 --> 00:17:09.563
Nah,
just checking some stuff out.

00:17:09.596 --> 00:17:12.064
Non-committal.
Classic loser mentality.

00:17:12.098 --> 00:17:12.699
I can help.

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:16.302
I'm starting
a mentorship program

00:17:16.335 --> 00:17:18.705
for people who want to win
at the game of life.

00:17:18.739 --> 00:17:20.841
- Fifty bucks an hour.
- Cool.

00:17:20.874 --> 00:17:22.743
How do you actually win at life?

00:17:22.776 --> 00:17:25.612
[scoffs] That's literally
the answer I charge money for.

00:17:27.848 --> 00:17:29.415

What's with the breakfast pizza?

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:31.217
My sister made it.

00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:33.520
I'm supposed to hand out slices
at school to make friends.

00:17:33.554 --> 00:17:35.321
A little desperate for day one,
don't you think?

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:38.424
I also notice that
you're wearing Velvet Mischief.

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:40.527
It's a wonderful cologne.

00:17:40.561 --> 00:17:42.161
And I strongly believe
that every young man

00:17:42.194 --> 00:17:43.296
should have his own
signature scent.

00:17:44.631 --> 00:17:46.533

I applied very much.

Listen, I'm gonna give you
a hot Garbage tip.

00:17:49.402 --> 00:17:51.304
Friendship is like a puzzle.

00:17:51.337 --> 00:17:53.239
Sometimes you think you need
lots of pieces to be cool.

00:17:53.272 --> 00:17:55.474
And sometimes
it's just one piece to be cool.

00:17:55.709 --> 00:17:57.176
And people will be like,

00:17:57.209 --> 00:17:59.345
"That's not a puzzle,
that's a picture."

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:02.081
And they have a right to speak,
too.

00:18:02.716 --> 00:18:03.884
Any questions?

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:05.519
Yeah. Quite a few, actually.

00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:08.589
Listen, kid. The point is,
there's no "I" in team.

00:18:08.622 --> 00:18:10.557
But there are two in winning.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.225

that my husband, Clemente,

recently divorced me.

00:18:43.557 --> 00:18:47.159
And to be honest, I expected it
to hurt more than it does.

You know, the fire went out
on our marriage 20 years ago,

00:18:51.330 --> 00:18:53.767
but we stuck it out
for the dogs.

I teach gym, I teach art.

Financially,
I'm living in a nightmare, okay?

00:19:10.383 --> 00:19:13.219
I wouldn't wish my life
on my worst enemy.

Last year, I claimed
4,000 dollars on my tax return.

00:19:16.355 --> 00:19:19.693
So in the summer, I do clams
and oysters down by the airport.

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:22.596
But most of my money is tied up
in a drone kiosk at the mall.

do a still life.

Do the assignment next time.

00:19:52.425 --> 00:19:54.293
- [book thuds]
- [class giggling]

00:19:54.326 --> 00:19:55.796
That jetpack would never work.

00:19:55.829 --> 00:19:57.931
It's kind of foolproof,
actually. It's just math.

00:19:57.964 --> 00:20:00.600
My dad said math
has been debunked.

00:20:00.901 --> 00:20:03.603
Check it out. New kid thinks
he's a rocket scientist.

00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:04.871
[laughter]

00:20:04.905 --> 00:20:06.006
I'd love to be
a rocket scientist.

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:06.973
So prove it.

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:10.409

[whistle blows nearby]

00:20:35.035 --> 00:20:37.403
All right. Count us down, guys.

00:20:37.436 --> 00:20:41.273
[all]
Five, four, three, two, one!

00:20:43.009 --> 00:20:45.311
[kids exclaiming]

00:20:47.013 --> 00:20:49.281
Okay, so I know
that we're all very excited

00:20:49.315 --> 00:20:50.517
about the new rebrand,

00:20:50.884 --> 00:20:52.418
but I don't think you should

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.588
call your party bags,
"Salt Sacks."

00:20:57.456 --> 00:21:00.560

- [panting]

00:21:08.001 --> 00:21:09.435
Chuggy!

00:21:09.468 --> 00:21:10.704
Oh, no!

00:21:15.575 --> 00:21:17.343
[car alarms ringing in distance]

00:21:17.376 --> 00:21:18.779
I was never here, okay?

00:21:21.114 --> 00:21:23.683
Well, the good news
is nobody died.

00:21:23.984 --> 00:21:26.485
I'm sorry, okay?
It was an accident.

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:28.789
This could be grounds
for expulsion, Henry.

00:21:28.822 --> 00:21:30.624
I need you to call
your guardian.

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:32.491
[sighs]

[Garrett] <i>Game Over World.</i>

00:21:38.832 --> 00:21:40.567
Hey, uh,
Mr. Garbage Man, it's Henry.

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.068
The kid with the Tater Tot
breakfast pizza?

00:21:42.102 --> 00:21:43.904
[Garrett] <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

00:21:43.937 --> 00:21:46.006
- [fly buzzing fitfully]
<i>- I have a weird favor to ask.</i>

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:48.575
Uh, could you come to my school
and pretend to be my uncle?

00:21:48.608 --> 00:21:50.342
No way.
I don't do that stuff anymore.

00:21:50.376 --> 00:21:51.945
I have 26 bucks.

00:21:51.978 --> 00:21:53.814
["We Gotta Party"
by Jag Team playing]

- [tires screeching]
- [motor revving]

00:21:59.586 --> 00:22:00.921
Hi, I'm Henry's uncle.

00:22:02.856 --> 00:22:04.456
You?

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:05.826
The Trash Bag?

00:22:05.859 --> 00:22:07.794
It's actually "Garbage Man."

00:22:07.828 --> 00:22:10.063
Garbage Man, huh?

00:22:10.096 --> 00:22:13.365
You can bag me up
and take me to the curb anytime.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:15.836
But you gotta bungee the lid

00:22:15.869 --> 00:22:17.771
'cause I got a lot of raccoons
in there.

00:22:19.773 --> 00:22:21.808
Whoever divorced you
is a complete idiot.

00:22:23.442 --> 00:22:24.578

[Henry] <i>I just don't get it.
It should have worked.</i>

00:22:33.153 --> 00:22:34.654
The math is right.

00:22:34.688 --> 00:22:36.590
But I probably
just cost my sister her job.

00:22:37.489 --> 00:22:38.457
Oh, wow.

00:22:39.626 --> 00:22:40.794
You're super creative.

00:22:42.162 --> 00:22:43.730
Hey,
since you're going to juvie,

00:22:43.763 --> 00:22:45.999
you mind
if I get this flyer back?

00:22:46.032 --> 00:22:48.535
Paper don't grow on trees, and...

00:22:48.568 --> 00:22:50.103
not really allowed
in Kinko's anymore.

00:22:50.136 --> 00:22:51.470
Well, you can have my book, too.

00:22:52.739 --> 00:22:53.840
'Cause I'm done with it.

00:22:58.712 --> 00:23:00.847
So what's this stupid junk?

00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:02.082
Who cares?

00:23:03.482 --> 00:23:04.918
Probably some new age bullcrap.

00:23:05.785 --> 00:23:07.453
I could let it go for like 950.

00:23:07.486 --> 00:23:08.788
I wonder what it does.

00:23:13.627 --> 00:23:16.162

[stammering] Hey, dude. Dude?

00:23:41.888 --> 00:23:43.523

to go somewhere.

- [goats bleating]
- [Dawn grunts]

I'm sorry. I tried everything.
I didn't know who else to call.

No, it's okay. What's going on?

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:54.634
Henry's missing.
I tried the school.

00:23:54.668 --> 00:23:55.602
I tried his phone
a million times.

00:23:55.635 --> 00:23:56.870
He's not answering.

00:23:56.903 --> 00:23:58.004
He was supposed to be
home hours ago.

00:23:58.038 --> 00:23:59.673
I thought he'd still be
in detention

00:23:59.706 --> 00:24:01.741
for blowing up Chuggy The Chip.

00:24:02.742 --> 00:24:04.878
- That was him?
- Give me your phone.

00:24:04.911 --> 00:24:07.113
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, I can't believe this.

00:24:07.147 --> 00:24:09.115
We're here for one day, and he's
already the town villain.

00:24:09.149 --> 00:24:10.817
- [phone chimes]
- Got him!

00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:13.687
He's fine. He's just playing
in an abandoned mineshaft.

- What?

00:24:15.255 --> 00:24:17.657
Come on. I'll drive.

00:24:17.691 --> 00:24:19.759
You can feed Mr. Scribbles
this busted carrot

00:24:19.793 --> 00:24:21.561

that pretty face of yours.

We're not in Idaho anymore.

What are you making?

00:27:25.845 --> 00:27:27.881
Come closer. It's all right.

00:27:28.314 --> 00:27:29.949
Come on. I'm not gonna bite you.

Oh! How pretty.

find more gold?

Was I unclear when I said

00:28:13.193 --> 00:28:16.462
no one was to waste time
on art or leisure?

Dennis?

00:28:27.307 --> 00:28:31.911
You stole it from me,
and now you will retrieve it.

00:28:32.546 --> 00:28:35.148
It would be a privilege,
my liege.

00:28:35.348 --> 00:28:37.350
We're going to unbind you now.

00:28:39.085 --> 00:28:40.920
Don't do anything stupid.

00:28:40.954 --> 00:28:42.255
[scoffs] Of course not.

You can trust
this little dungeon pup.

Let me just...
Sneak attack... [gasps]

00:28:46.059 --> 00:28:48.795
Go ahead. Strike me down.

00:28:48.828 --> 00:28:52.865
My piglins will make a meal
of your beautiful wolf.

00:28:52.899 --> 00:28:54.367
How do I know
you're telling the truth?

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.970
There's only one way
to find out.

00:28:57.003 --> 00:28:59.906

and I am telling you, that thing

00:29:38.144 --> 00:29:39.812
doesn't understand
a word you're saying.

00:29:39.846 --> 00:29:41.247

We don't know any Dennis.

Then how'd you get that?

00:35:58.324 --> 00:36:01.360
Hey. <i>Relaje, muchacho.</i>
This is my property.

00:36:01.394 --> 00:36:03.396
Do you even know what that is?

00:36:03.429 --> 00:36:05.231
It's the Orb of Dominance.

00:36:05.264 --> 00:36:06.265
It's a cube.

00:36:06.298 --> 00:36:07.801
Okay. [exasperated shout]

You people seriously

have no idea
what you're dealing with.

00:36:10.737 --> 00:36:12.639
Hand it over
and no one gets hurt.

00:36:12.673 --> 00:36:14.206
No way!

00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.642
Okay, we need this thing
to get home.

00:36:15.676 --> 00:36:18.477
I hate to take a big,
fat dumparoo on your plans,

00:36:18.512 --> 00:36:19.846
but you can't get home.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.248
W-W-Wait. What do you mean
we can't get home?

00:36:22.281 --> 00:36:24.216
Not without the Earth Crystal.

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.353
You mean that little boxy thing?
Garbage Man busted it.

00:36:27.386 --> 00:36:28.287
Nuh-uh.

00:36:29.156 --> 00:36:31.223
Listen, Henry,
why don't you hold this?

00:36:31.257 --> 00:36:33.259
You got those good Frodo vibes,
kid.

00:36:33.292 --> 00:36:34.561
I got Frodo vibes.

00:36:34.594 --> 00:36:36.228
Are you implying
that we're stuck here?

00:36:36.262 --> 00:36:37.463
Yes!

00:36:37.496 --> 00:36:38.932
Unless you get
the Earth Crystal.

00:36:38.965 --> 00:36:40.801
It's your only way home.

00:36:40.834 --> 00:36:43.235
There's only one way
you could ever replace it,

00:36:43.269 --> 00:36:44.538
at the Woodland Mansion,

00:36:44.571 --> 00:36:46.707
but going there
would get you all killed!

00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:48.240
Well, so would staying here.

00:36:49.375 --> 00:36:50.610
Fair enough.

00:36:50.644 --> 00:36:51.845
Listen, I can get you home,

00:36:51.878 --> 00:36:53.714
but then you gotta
give me that Orb.

00:36:53.747 --> 00:36:54.981
So,
what are you gonna do with it?

00:36:55.015 --> 00:36:56.883
None of your concern!

00:36:57.416 --> 00:37:00.587
So, what do you say?
Do we have a deal?

00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:01.988
He did just kill,
like, 20 zombies.

00:37:02.022 --> 00:37:04.490
Pfft! More like 15, but okay.

00:37:05.458 --> 00:37:06.893
All right, Steve.

00:37:07.561 --> 00:37:08.962
Under two conditions.

00:37:08.995 --> 00:37:11.965
One, always address me,
because I'm the leader.

00:37:12.465 --> 00:37:13.967
Two, if you double-cross us...

- [Dawn] I'm so sorry.
- [grunts]

00:37:23.543 --> 00:37:25.946
We just met this man,
and he's not the leader.

00:37:25.979 --> 00:37:27.814
Hmm!

00:37:27.848 --> 00:37:29.616
Well, it looks like
Dr. Swollenstein here

00:37:29.649 --> 00:37:31.685
just got himself a deal.

Oh, my God.

00:37:38.692 --> 00:37:40.026
[Steve] All right.

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:41.728
First we need to load up
on some gear,

00:37:41.762 --> 00:37:43.530
or we're all gonna die.

00:37:43.563 --> 00:37:44.698
Let's go to Midport Village.

00:37:46.066 --> 00:37:47.934
This guy's lost his mind.

00:37:47.968 --> 00:37:48.869
[Steve] Move out!

00:37:53.907 --> 00:37:55.474

Oh, my God. Are you all right?
Oh, my God.

Oh, my God. Are you all right?

You're not gonna sue me,
are you?

00:38:30.043 --> 00:38:31.711
Because everyone wants to sue me

00:38:31.745 --> 00:38:33.980
once I hit them
with my Jeep Grand Cherokee.

00:38:34.014 --> 00:38:36.716
- Hurr.
- Oh, my.

00:38:37.050 --> 00:38:39.451
How about this? What if I
just take you to dinner?

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.588
Would you like to go to dinner?

00:38:41.621 --> 00:38:42.589
Huh.

00:38:50.496 --> 00:38:53.099
[Steve] Here it is.
Midport Village.

00:38:53.133 --> 00:38:55.001
I got a secret stash
of elite loot

00:38:55.035 --> 00:38:57.003
that'll help us survive
the Woodland Mansion.

00:38:57.037 --> 00:38:59.471
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
who are these guys?

00:38:59.506 --> 00:39:01.541
Oh, these dudes?
They're the villagers.

00:39:01.808 --> 00:39:04.443
They're total pacifists
and vegetarians.

00:39:04.476 --> 00:39:06.580
You don't bug them,
they won't bug you.

00:39:06.613 --> 00:39:09.916
They just like to chill, trade,
and eat buttloads of bread.

00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.585
They love crushing loaf.

00:39:11.618 --> 00:39:12.919
So they built all this?

00:39:12.953 --> 00:39:14.486
[Steve] Yeah, most of it.

00:39:14.521 --> 00:39:17.757
But the good stuff you see,
that's all Steve.

00:39:19.759 --> 00:39:22.629
Whoa. Is he some kind of king?

00:39:22.662 --> 00:39:23.563
[Steve] No.

00:39:24.865 --> 00:39:26.666
That's a legend.

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:29.102
Kid, anything you can
dream about here,

00:39:29.135 --> 00:39:30.670

Zero limits.
You know what I'm talking about.

00:39:33.173 --> 00:39:35.141

- Yeah.

00:39:35.575 --> 00:39:37.644

00:39:55.494 --> 00:39:56.897

Can I talk to you for a second?

00:46:43.870 --> 00:46:45.004
Sure thing.

00:46:46.139 --> 00:46:48.141
[launcher powers up]

00:46:49.876 --> 00:46:51.144
[axe clanging]

00:46:52.378 --> 00:46:53.880
What's up?

00:46:53.913 --> 00:46:55.848
You know that note
you left with the Orb?

00:46:55.882 --> 00:46:56.983
The one about the riches?

00:46:57.551 --> 00:46:58.451
I read it.

00:46:58.652 --> 00:47:00.920
Yeah. There's riches everywhere.

00:47:00.953 --> 00:47:03.389
I keep a fat stash of diamonds
at the Redstone Mines.

00:47:03.423 --> 00:47:04.591
So this treasure load,

00:47:04.625 --> 00:47:06.527
is it on the way
to this Mansion place?

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.494
Not really. It's a major detour.

00:47:08.529 --> 00:47:10.597
Plus, the mines can be perilous.

00:47:10.631 --> 00:47:12.165
Let me keep it simple for you,
Steve.

00:47:14.934 --> 00:47:17.236
No diamonds, no Orb.

00:47:19.005 --> 00:47:20.039
You smell what I'm steppin' in?

00:47:22.509 --> 00:47:23.943
Hurr...

00:47:26.145 --> 00:47:27.313
Good day.

00:47:27.347 --> 00:47:28.615
Huh...

00:47:29.449 --> 00:47:33.319
We need a map
to the Woodland Mansion.

00:47:33.353 --> 00:47:34.987
Uhhrr-uhr?

00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:36.189

Uh-oh.

00:47:40.059 --> 00:47:41.894
- Nat?
- Dawn?

00:47:41.928 --> 00:47:42.962
Something's going down.

00:48:01.582 --> 00:48:03.015
Huh.

00:48:05.218 --> 00:48:06.419
[Chungus] All right, guys,

00:48:06.452 --> 00:48:08.921
just start trashing
their produce.

00:48:08.955 --> 00:48:10.323
Villagers hate that.

00:48:13.025 --> 00:48:15.161

00:48:39.252 --> 00:48:40.420
Who are these guys?

00:48:40.453 --> 00:48:42.388
Piglins.
They must be after the Orb.

00:48:43.423 --> 00:48:44.957
[all grunting]

00:48:45.224 --> 00:48:48.461
Hey, Steve.
What's going on, dude?

00:48:48.695 --> 00:48:51.264
Crap! Chungus.

00:48:51.297 --> 00:48:55.101
I'm really sorry, but I have to
un-alive you and stuff.

00:48:55.134 --> 00:48:56.269
[yells sharply]

00:48:56.302 --> 00:48:58.004
Malgosha double-crossed me.

00:48:58.639 --> 00:49:00.541
We just need that Orb thingy.

00:49:00.574 --> 00:49:02.074
You know this guy?

00:49:02.108 --> 00:49:04.310
Yeah, we used to get
into some dungeon stuff.

00:49:04.343 --> 00:49:06.212
He seems nice,
but he's a killer!

00:49:06.245 --> 00:49:08.582
Wow, you look good, Bro-Hammer.

00:49:08.615 --> 00:49:09.982
You lose some weight?

00:49:10.016 --> 00:49:11.752
Stand back, boys.

00:49:11.785 --> 00:49:13.252
This pig is mine.

00:49:13.286 --> 00:49:14.420
No.

00:49:15.388 --> 00:49:17.658
I'm tired of you
getting all the glory.

00:49:18.491 --> 00:49:19.593
This pig is mine.

- We have to get to Henry.
- Yeah.

00:49:47.253 --> 00:49:48.321
Do you think we could
take these guys?

[Chungus] The party's over, bud.

00:50:54.555 --> 00:50:56.489
Just give me the Orb.

00:50:56.523 --> 00:50:58.257
Let me tell you something.
Let me tell you something!

00:50:58.559 --> 00:50:59.492

00:51:06.567 --> 00:51:08.301
I just saved your butt,
that's what happened.

00:51:08.334 --> 00:51:09.402
You can thank me later.

00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:11.538

He's my entire family.

He needs you alive, okay?

00:51:29.155 --> 00:51:30.591
We'll meet him back
at the Woodland Mansion.

01:05:23.657 --> 01:05:25.491
We didn't need
those stupid diamonds.

01:05:25.526 --> 01:05:26.693
I swear,
you are literally the most

01:05:26.727 --> 01:05:28.394
selfish person I've ever met.

01:05:28.428 --> 01:05:31.097
Whatever. I need them, okay?

01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:32.398
I need the diamonds,

01:05:32.432 --> 01:05:34.467
because I need the money,
because I'm broke.

01:05:35.268 --> 01:05:37.236
You wouldn't know
anything about that.

01:05:39.338 --> 01:05:42.509
My life sucks, kid. All right?
I'm a frickin' loser.

01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:44.578
There, I said it.

01:05:45.411 --> 01:05:47.413
I know it looks like I got it
all put together, right?

01:05:47.447 --> 01:05:50.016
I'm smart, funny, bilingual.

01:05:57.724 --> 01:05:59.158
But that's not the reality.

01:06:00.426 --> 01:06:01.961
I'm not doing well.

01:06:03.029 --> 01:06:05.364
I'm washed up, Hank,
and I'm gonna lose everything.

01:06:06.533 --> 01:06:08.201
And that's not the worst part.

01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:10.970
I'm alone.

01:06:11.805 --> 01:06:12.639
You weren't alone.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.174
I was your friend.

01:06:20.112 --> 01:06:21.648
Sorry about your finances.

01:06:22.549 --> 01:06:23.750
Shut up, Steve.

[Marlene] <i>Wow.</i>

01:06:30.256 --> 01:06:31.491
I feel like you get me, and
you're an incredible listener.

01:06:31.525 --> 01:06:35.629
And only people with emotional
intelligence are good listeners.

01:06:37.396 --> 01:06:39.633
You know, I just didn't think
it was in the cards

01:06:39.666 --> 01:06:42.034
that I would have another
first date, ever, you know?

01:06:42.502 --> 01:06:43.537
Hm.

01:06:44.437 --> 01:06:46.105
I wanna have the guts
to invite you

01:06:46.138 --> 01:06:47.674
over to my house for dessert.

01:06:48.107 --> 01:06:49.743
Huh. Uh-huh.

01:06:50.376 --> 01:06:51.578
Are you finished?

01:06:52.111 --> 01:06:53.614
No, I think he's Swedish.

01:06:54.146 --> 01:06:55.481
But we're done with our meal.

01:06:57.584 --> 01:07:00.621
There it is.
The Woodland Mansion.

01:07:00.654 --> 01:07:02.623
We're gonna get in there,
get the Earth Crystal

01:07:02.656 --> 01:07:04.357
and get you guys home.

01:07:04.390 --> 01:07:05.559
Follow me!

01:07:06.225 --> 01:07:07.193
Check this out.

01:07:07.828 --> 01:07:09.295
Let's do this.

01:07:09.328 --> 01:07:11.532
Pay close attention
to Papa Steve.

01:07:11.565 --> 01:07:13.767
The Woodland Mansion
has three floors.

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:17.370
The first floor
is loaded with Vindicators.

01:07:17.671 --> 01:07:19.205
Axe murderers, basically.

01:07:19.238 --> 01:07:20.574
Why is the third floor
on the first floor?

01:07:20.607 --> 01:07:22.308
I'm very confused.

01:07:22.341 --> 01:07:23.744
[Steve] I was trying
to make three floors,

01:07:23.777 --> 01:07:25.679
but I didn't have time to make,
like, a doll house.

01:07:25.879 --> 01:07:29.315
The second floor
crawls with Evokers.

01:07:29.348 --> 01:07:31.450
They wield powerful dark magic.

01:07:31.484 --> 01:07:33.119
This is the worst model
I've ever seen.

01:07:33.152 --> 01:07:34.320
Garrett, stop talking.

01:07:34.353 --> 01:07:35.656
We're trying
to figure out a plan.

01:07:35.689 --> 01:07:37.156
Bro, how long are you
gonna be mad at me for?

01:07:37.189 --> 01:07:38.391
I just got mad at you.

01:07:38.759 --> 01:07:40.293
Please don't be mad at me
for this, okay?

01:07:40.326 --> 01:07:42.361
But I accidentally stole the Orb
while you were crafting.

01:07:44.263 --> 01:07:45.832
Are we cool now?

01:07:45.866 --> 01:07:48.769
You are literally the worst
person in the entire world.

01:07:48.802 --> 01:07:52.438
Guys! Both of you,
eyes on my demonstraysh!

01:07:52.639 --> 01:07:55.374
Third floor houses
the Loot Chamber.

01:07:55.742 --> 01:07:57.343
That's where
the Earth Crystal is,

01:07:57.376 --> 01:07:59.680
but it's guarded by Endermen.

01:07:59.713 --> 01:08:02.381
Whatever you do,
do not look them in the eye.

01:08:02.415 --> 01:08:04.116
They'll fry your brains out.

01:08:04.150 --> 01:08:06.185
Okay, well I could build stairs
to the second floor,

01:08:06.218 --> 01:08:08.254
sneak in through the window,
and snag the Earth Crystal.

01:08:08.287 --> 01:08:10.156
That's a great idea, Hank.

01:08:10.189 --> 01:08:13.060
But to pull it off, we're gonna
need a pretty sweet diversion.

01:08:13.527 --> 01:08:15.428
You know what could work
on these guys?

01:08:15.461 --> 01:08:16.429
It sounds crazy.

01:08:16.462 --> 01:08:17.698

01:15:11.745 --> 01:15:13.279
Garrett,
you don't have to do this!

01:15:13.313 --> 01:15:15.048
Tell my story in song.

01:15:15.348 --> 01:15:18.718
Keep it metal. Keep it heavy.
Real instruments.

01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:20.820
Besides...

01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:24.924
I love luaus.

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:28.261
Spin kick.

01:15:30.730 --> 01:15:31.731
[roaring]

01:15:31.765 --> 01:15:33.299
[high battle cry]

01:15:35.201 --> 01:15:37.170
Garbage toss! Oh, crap!

01:15:37.704 --> 01:15:39.239
[Steve shouts]

01:15:39.272 --> 01:15:42.142
[Henry] No!

01:15:42.175 --> 01:15:44.210
[both yelling]

01:15:44.244 --> 01:15:47.280
We're going down!

01:15:47.781 --> 01:15:49.582
Brace for impact!

01:15:49.616 --> 01:15:52.619
[both yelling]

01:15:53.053 --> 01:15:54.854
[grunting]

01:16:03.329 --> 01:16:05.832
[Steve chuckles]

01:16:09.102 --> 01:16:10.637
- Dennis?
- [whines]

01:16:11.104 --> 01:16:13.106
- Dennis!
- [Dawn laughing]

01:16:13.139 --> 01:16:15.108
It's you! It's really you!

01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:17.577
[laughing]

01:16:18.178 --> 01:16:19.279
Gimme...

01:16:19.312 --> 01:16:21.347
[babbling affectionately]

01:16:22.715 --> 01:16:24.084
Oh!

01:16:24.117 --> 01:16:25.752
How'd you find me?

01:16:25.785 --> 01:16:27.120
He's one heck of a wolf.

01:16:27.153 --> 01:16:29.389
He led us right to you guys.

01:16:29.422 --> 01:16:31.925
Now I understand why you kept
yourself so filthy and smelly,

01:16:31.958 --> 01:16:33.226
so Dennis could find you
one day.

01:16:35.061 --> 01:16:36.062
Is he okay?

01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:38.264
He's fine. He's just resting.

01:16:38.298 --> 01:16:39.766
Good.

01:16:39.799 --> 01:16:41.201
It was a pretty rough
crash landing.

01:16:42.335 --> 01:16:43.870
Wait a minute. Where are we?

01:16:45.271 --> 01:16:47.273
- [Dawn laughing]
- Whoa!

01:16:49.442 --> 01:16:52.378
I wish Garbage Man
was here to see this.

01:16:52.412 --> 01:16:54.214
He would've loved
your mushroom hut.

01:16:54.247 --> 01:16:55.882
Yeah, I think so, too.

01:16:59.819 --> 01:17:02.155
[voice shaking]
I was so afraid that I lost you.

01:17:04.691 --> 01:17:06.025
I was so afraid
that I lost you, too.

01:17:08.328 --> 01:17:10.964
I am really sorry
about what I said.

01:17:12.799 --> 01:17:14.634
And I'm really sorry
about Garrett.

01:17:17.871 --> 01:17:19.439
[ghast shrieking]

01:17:19.472 --> 01:17:22.175
[Malgosha]
I'm only gonna say this once.

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:25.712
This thingy goes
on top of that thingy.

01:17:25.745 --> 01:17:27.280
Got it, Travis?

01:17:27.313 --> 01:17:31.217
It's gonna make a real cool
laser beam that'll darken...

01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:32.719
[shrieking]

01:17:32.752 --> 01:17:34.787
[Malgosha, growls] Never mind.

01:17:40.059 --> 01:17:43.296
[deep rumbling]

01:17:43.329 --> 01:17:45.431
- [zombies moaning]
- [bones rattling]

01:17:50.737 --> 01:17:51.938
[chattering]

01:17:55.041 --> 01:17:57.177
[all grumbling, growling]

01:17:59.746 --> 01:18:02.282
[Steve] No. No!

01:18:03.517 --> 01:18:06.819
The Great Darkening! It's begun.

01:18:06.853 --> 01:18:08.855
Malgosha's gathering
all her forces.

01:18:08.888 --> 01:18:10.924
She will destroy this land.

01:18:11.457 --> 01:18:14.360
Unless... we go get that Orb.

01:18:14.394 --> 01:18:16.229
Well, what're we doing here?

01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:19.465
Let's go fight some pigs.

01:18:19.499 --> 01:18:22.001
I'm ready.
I'm done with those pigs.

01:18:22.035 --> 01:18:22.936
Yeah, me too.

01:18:22.969 --> 01:18:25.171
Let's do it for Gar-Gar.

01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:28.007
First we mine, then we craft.

01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:29.742
Let's Minecraft!

01:18:29.776 --> 01:18:32.045
- [grunts] One, two, three.
- Team!

01:18:32.078 --> 01:18:33.746
- Get the Orb!
- Orb! What are you saying?

01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.381
- Minecraft.
- We should all say that.

01:18:35.415 --> 01:18:37.750
On three. One...
Forget it. There's no time!

01:18:39.185 --> 01:18:40.521
[Steve]
Show us what you got, Henry.

01:18:40.554 --> 01:18:42.222
[Henry] Okay. I got a plan.

01:18:42.255 --> 01:18:43.790
[Steve] Killer recipes.

01:18:43.823 --> 01:18:44.958
We're gonna have to move fast.

01:18:44.991 --> 01:18:46.326
Let's get to work!

01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:49.530
[Henry] <i>First we're gonna need
some iron ingots.</i>

01:18:49.563 --> 01:18:51.297
[sizzling]

01:18:54.167 --> 01:18:55.902
[grunts] Oh, yeah!

01:18:57.971 --> 01:18:59.138
[Henry]
<i>And the boots of Swiftness.</i>

01:19:01.508 --> 01:19:03.309
[Dawn]
<i>Time to light this place up.</i>

01:19:03.343 --> 01:19:05.044
- [bones rattling]
- Come on, boys.

01:19:07.347 --> 01:19:09.282
Have a nice flight!

01:19:11.851 --> 01:19:14.187
Yeah, man! Whoo!

01:19:14.220 --> 01:19:17.090
I bet you do. I bet you do!

01:19:17.123 --> 01:19:18.559
[Henry] <i>We're also gonna
need a ton of diamonds.</i>

01:19:18.592 --> 01:19:21.227
[grunting]

01:19:23.496 --> 01:19:24.897
[Steve]
Show me what you got, Nat.

01:19:25.865 --> 01:19:27.433
Whoa! Yeah!

01:19:28.569 --> 01:19:29.802
[Natalie] You want some, buddy?

01:19:33.406 --> 01:19:35.041
[excited chatter]

01:19:35.341 --> 01:19:36.309
We're ready.

01:19:36.342 --> 01:19:38.311
Let's go save the Overworld!

01:19:38.612 --> 01:19:40.813
[piglins roaring]

01:19:40.847 --> 01:19:42.949
[Malgosha cackling]

01:19:45.586 --> 01:19:47.086
All right, my piggies.

01:19:48.988 --> 01:19:53.192
Today,
we take the Overworld as ours!

01:19:53.226 --> 01:19:54.528
[all roaring]

01:19:54.561 --> 01:19:56.863
Attack their villages.

01:19:56.896 --> 01:20:00.567
Burn their homes
and their symmetrical farms.

01:20:01.234 --> 01:20:05.471
All they have created,
we destroy!

01:20:05.506 --> 01:20:08.808
[all roaring]

01:20:09.342 --> 01:20:11.612
Well, what are you
standing around for?

01:20:11.645 --> 01:20:12.979
Get out of here!

01:20:13.012 --> 01:20:15.281
Go on, bring me the gold!

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.289
[Natalie grunting]

01:20:27.226 --> 01:20:29.262
- [Iron grunting]
- [Natalie] Hurry, Henry!

01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:35.602
[heavy metallic grunting]

01:20:51.552 --> 01:20:54.420
[thudding, metallic footfalls]

01:20:56.657 --> 01:20:57.591
Uh?

01:21:03.296 --> 01:21:05.898
Hah! News flash!

01:21:06.132 --> 01:21:08.968
Iron Golems will not attack
unless provoked.

01:21:09.001 --> 01:21:11.070
[cackles]

01:21:11.672 --> 01:21:12.905
- [hollow clang]
- [arrow clatters]

01:21:12.939 --> 01:21:13.906
[exasperated groan]

01:21:17.544 --> 01:21:19.613
Real smooth, Travis!

01:21:24.618 --> 01:21:26.452
[high-pitched whistling]

01:21:36.362 --> 01:21:38.131
[piglins screeching]

01:21:39.465 --> 01:21:40.534
You ready?

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.034
Let's do this.

01:21:46.305 --> 01:21:48.374
[Natalie grunting]

01:21:55.982 --> 01:21:57.651
[Malgosha]
Oh, for goodness' sake!

01:21:57.684 --> 01:22:01.053
Well, what are you doing,
you big block of meat?

01:22:01.087 --> 01:22:03.222
Get down there and take care
of those Roundlings!

01:22:04.023 --> 01:22:05.491
[growling]

01:22:05.526 --> 01:22:07.393
[cackling]

01:22:11.264 --> 01:22:13.734
[roaring]

01:22:13.767 --> 01:22:15.702
How do you like them pork chops?

01:22:16.670 --> 01:22:18.572
[growling]

01:22:21.642 --> 01:22:22.576
Come on!

01:22:29.215 --> 01:22:30.416
[hooting laughter]

01:22:30.450 --> 01:22:31.685
[gasps] Huh?

01:22:36.322 --> 01:22:39.125
Okay, Goshe. Let's dance.

01:22:39.325 --> 01:22:40.627
Bring it on.

01:22:40.661 --> 01:22:42.261
[yells]

01:22:42.295 --> 01:22:43.597
[snarls]

01:22:46.165 --> 01:22:50.637
Sneak attack!

01:22:52.706 --> 01:22:53.640
[grunts]

01:22:53.674 --> 01:22:54.775
Hah!

01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:56.442
[grunts]

01:22:56.743 --> 01:22:58.277
[grunts] Ooh!

01:23:00.313 --> 01:23:01.347

01:23:02.215 --> 01:23:03.282
My diamond armor!

01:23:03.684 --> 01:23:05.318
Egg attack! Hyah!

01:23:05.819 --> 01:23:07.119
- Frizz!
- [Malgosha growls]

01:23:08.254 --> 01:23:09.756
What is this, breakfast?

01:23:09.790 --> 01:23:11.090
[grunts]

01:23:11.123 --> 01:23:12.191
- [chickens clucking]

- [thud]
- [agonized groan]

01:23:31.444 --> 01:23:33.079
Do it, Henry.

01:23:33.112 --> 01:23:34.113
I got this.

01:23:41.522 --> 01:23:42.556
[gasps]

01:23:44.357 --> 01:23:45.324
Go, Henry, go!

[bellowing]

01:23:56.737 --> 01:23:58.639
[sharp whistle]

01:23:58.672 --> 01:24:00.641
[Dawn] Hey, Captain Butt Crack!

01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:05.812
I got something for you.

01:24:07.213 --> 01:24:08.815
[guffawing]

01:24:10.383 --> 01:24:11.384
Get him, Dennis.

01:24:12.686 --> 01:24:14.788
- [wolves howling]
- [Dawn laughing]

01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:23.496
Whoo!
Take a bite outta that pig!

Finish this, Henry!

01:24:52.759 --> 01:24:54.628
[both grunting]

[screaming]

01:25:04.871 --> 01:25:06.807
Whoo-hooo!

01:25:10.777 --> 01:25:13.547
[grunting] Gotcha, kid!

01:25:13.580 --> 01:25:15.481
- [shrieking] Yes!
- Yes!

01:25:15.749 --> 01:25:17.718
[laughing] Yes!

01:25:17.751 --> 01:25:19.553
Garrett, you're alive!

01:25:19.586 --> 01:25:21.822
Yeah! [affectionate grunt]

01:25:21.855 --> 01:25:24.558
Between us, I used
Steve's water bucket trick.

01:25:24.591 --> 01:25:25.458
Pretty cool, huh?

01:25:25.859 --> 01:25:27.360
Little bit.

01:25:27.393 --> 01:25:28.862
Let's get this Orb and go home.

01:25:30.764 --> 01:25:33.667
[Natalie] Yes! Yes, go, Henry!

01:25:33.967 --> 01:25:36.202
All right, Hank.
It's fireball time.

01:25:36.235 --> 01:25:37.370
Grab that spear.

01:25:37.804 --> 01:25:39.706
I want you to jab it
in the tentacles.

01:25:40.574 --> 01:25:41.908
- Yeah.
- [ghast screeching]

01:25:41.942 --> 01:25:43.376
[Garrett] Whoo! Jab it!

01:25:45.378 --> 01:25:46.613
[Garrett] Yeah!

01:25:46.647 --> 01:25:48.214
How'd you learn how to do that?

01:25:48.247 --> 01:25:48.849
Don't ask.

01:25:50.851 --> 01:25:52.451
[Garrett] Whoo!

01:25:52.485 --> 01:25:53.419
Yeah!

01:26:00.761 --> 01:26:02.428
[groaning in pain]

01:26:03.897 --> 01:26:06.733
[joyful shrieking]

01:26:13.874 --> 01:26:14.875
[Malgosha] No!

01:26:15.909 --> 01:26:17.511
What have you done?

01:26:17.978 --> 01:26:19.278
The Orb!

01:26:25.919 --> 01:26:28.555
[cackling]

01:26:28.588 --> 01:26:30.590
[thudding footsteps]

01:26:48.642 --> 01:26:50.544
[orb humming]

01:26:52.913 --> 01:26:54.280
[Natalie] Yes!

01:26:58.785 --> 01:27:01.454
[laughs] It's good
to see you, Garbage Man.

01:27:01.487 --> 01:27:02.354
[Garrett] Yeah, it is.

01:27:06.492 --> 01:27:08.260
[Steve] Parry! Thrust!

01:27:09.663 --> 01:27:11.698
[breath rasping]

01:27:15.569 --> 01:27:17.571
You failed, witch.

01:27:17.604 --> 01:27:19.606
The Overworld lives on.

01:27:19.639 --> 01:27:22.943
You, too,
have fallen for the great lie.

01:27:22.976 --> 01:27:24.945
You'll never be happy.

01:27:25.444 --> 01:27:27.379
Deep down, you know.

01:27:27.413 --> 01:27:31.317
