about a guy who ate an
undercooked pork chop and...

got a worm that made his
brain swell up super fast.

Uh-huh.

38
00:04:05.997 --> 00:04:10.208
And to relieve the pressure, they had
to cut out a chunk of his skull.

39
00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:11.376
Oh, wow.

40
00:04:11.377 --> 00:04:15.839
Like a triangle of his skull, they
cut it right out of his head...

41
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.592
and they implanted
it in his groin...

42
00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:20.510
so it wouldn't die.

43
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:22.763
Otherwise, his brain would have...

44
00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:25.015
his head would have exploded.

45

Mmm-hmm.

46
00:04:26.142 --> 00:04:28.018
The skull was holding his brain...

47
00:04:28.019 --> 00:04:32.756
which was swelling, and his
head would have just exploded.

48
00:04:33.566 --> 00:04:36.568

You really like this guy, huh?

174
00:10:09.777 --> 00:10:12.445
So forget all this bullshit
and go surprise him.

175
00:10:12.446 --> 00:10:14.197
- It's not bullshit.
- It is.

176
00:10:14.198 --> 00:10:17.367
Put on something sexy, get
your ass out to Connecticut...

177
00:10:17.368 --> 00:10:19.853
and fix that young man's plumbing.

178
00:10:42.059 --> 00:10:44.302
- Don't worry, you look good.
- Thanks.

179
00:10:44.303 --> 00:10:46.163
- He'll love it.
- Who?

180
00:10:46.438 --> 00:10:48.173
Whoever.
(CHUCKLES)

181
00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:51.343
Here you go. Thanks for the ride.

182
00:10:52.236 --> 00:10:53.653
Need me to wait?

183
00:10:53.654 --> 00:10:55.347
Nah, I think I got it.

- Hi.
- Hi.

187
00:11:23.309 --> 00:11:25.268
I'm looking for Mark.

188
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:27.504
Oh. What's this about?

189
00:11:27.605 --> 00:11:30.106
I'm Carly. You must
be his housekeeper.

190
00:11:30.107 --> 00:11:32.509
No, I'm his wife, Kate.

191
00:11:36.822 --> 00:11:40.025
Is this some kind of
stripper-gram or something?

192
00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:42.144
Oh.

193
00:11:42.494 --> 00:11:44.746
No. No. I have the wrong address.

194
00:11:44.747 --> 00:11:47.232
I'm looking for a different Mark.

195
00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.401
Mark Kink.

196
00:11:49.627 --> 00:11:50.835
Mark King?

197
00:11:50.836 --> 00:11:52.712
No! No, no.

198
00:11:52.713 --> 00:11:55.215
He's a short guy? Bald?

199
00:11:55.216 --> 00:11:57.842
Lives a couple of
streets over on Clark.

200
00:11:57.843 --> 00:11:58.968
There is no Clark Street.

201
00:11:58.969 --> 00:12:00.220
Anyway...

202
00:12:00.221 --> 00:12:01.804
Ooh! Ah! Ah!

203
00:12:01.805 --> 00:12:03.373
Oh, my God!

204
00:12:03.974 --> 00:12:05.417
Shit.

205
00:12:07.978 --> 00:12:10.881
Um. I'll send you a
check for your urn.

(GRUNTS)

209
00:13:11.041 --> 00:13:12.776
What happened?

210
00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:16.212
It must be big. You were crazy
about him two days ago.

211
00:13:16.213 --> 00:13:20.216
It can't be the sex... you were a lot
nicer and your hair was more shiny.

212
00:13:20.217 --> 00:13:22.786
He has a wife, okay? He's married.

213
00:13:22.803 --> 00:13:24.721
You don't think you can take her?

214
00:13:24.722 --> 00:13:27.307
That's not the point.
I don't do married guys.

215
00:13:27.308 --> 00:13:29.600
I don't need to wreck
someone's home for a date.

216
00:13:29.601 --> 00:13:31.811
It's not always a wreck. Stan
and I were married when we met.

217
00:13:31.812 --> 00:13:33.813
We weren't happy. Now we are.

218
00:13:33.814 --> 00:13:35.648
You wrecked two marriages!

219
00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:38.901
First, one was mine, so that
doesn't count. Second of all.

220
00:13:38.902 --> 00:13:41.321
Stan's wife was fat,
with no sexual charisma.

221
00:13:41.322 --> 00:13:44.240
That marriage was doomed,
so it wasn't cheating.

222
00:13:44.241 --> 00:13:46.075
I don't think that's how it works.

223
00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:49.329
But I think a married guy
is a perfect fit for you.

224
00:13:49.330 --> 00:13:51.748
Mark was able to lead
a whole other life

225
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:53.666
without you even noticing.

226
00:13:53.667 --> 00:13:56.002
You need a guy with
something to keep him busy.

227

Not a wife!

I don't do this. I'm
too old for this shit.

00:14:00.966 --> 00:14:05.162
I've been dating for decades!
I don't need this anymore!

230
00:14:05.637 --> 00:14:08.264
Somebody's being negative.
I'm gonna go.

told me... words to live by.

There's someone here
to see you... Kate King.

237
00:14:37.169 --> 00:14:40.338
Hi. I'm Kate. I met you on Friday.

238
00:14:40.339 --> 00:14:45.410
Yeah, I remember. Sorry about
your urn. What are you doing here?

239
00:14:45.803 --> 00:14:48.638
Um, I found your number
in my husband's phone.

240
00:14:48.639 --> 00:14:50.014
So, um...

241
00:14:50.015 --> 00:14:52.350
Well, actually, the phone bill,

242
00:14:52.351 --> 00:14:54.811
because I couldn't crack
the code on his password.

243
00:14:54.812 --> 00:14:58.689
Which is fitting, as obviously I don't
know anything going on in his life.

244
00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:01.526
But, anyhow, I'm here.

245
00:15:01.527 --> 00:15:03.861
I thought maybe we could talk?

246
00:15:03.862 --> 00:15:06.155
No, we can't. If you
have any questions

247
00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:08.767
about your husband,
you should ask him.

248
00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:12.036
Oh, well, I would,
but I'm pretty sure...

249
00:15:12.037 --> 00:15:15.774
he's lying to me and sleeping
with you. (CHUCKLES)

250
00:15:17.709 --> 00:15:19.277

you would tell me I was crazy.

would be right at all.

The details do matter, because...

between having sex

Oh, my God! Did you do
it more than ten times?

get a game plan and leave.

work it out? Maybe that's an option.

if I can hold out.

What is going on?

696
00:37:55.858 --> 00:37:58.902
I don't know! There's
been wine, and...

697
00:37:58.903 --> 00:38:00.987
hand-holding during dinner.

698
00:38:00.988 --> 00:38:03.239
It just felt so good to
be touched, you know?

699
00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.367
Yeah, I do, because he
used to touch me, too.

700
00:38:06.368 --> 00:38:08.411
Ugh! Why do you say that?

701
00:38:08.412 --> 00:38:10.371
- A lot.
- I don't want to hear that.

702
00:38:10.372 --> 00:38:12.749
- Then why call me? For permission?
- No!

If you want to have sex
with your husband, do it

704
00:38:15.044 --> 00:38:17.712
I'm wondering, what if I
keep my clothes on...

705
00:38:17.713 --> 00:38:19.422
- while we're having sex?
- Really?

706
00:38:19.423 --> 00:38:24.594
What if the top part of me hated
him, while the bottom part of me...

707
00:38:24.595 --> 00:38:27.555
did all the dirty work? What if
he just put it in halfway...

708
00:38:27.556 --> 00:38:30.834
and then I took a really hot bath
after and really cleaned up?

709
00:38:30.935 --> 00:38:32.185
You're making a mistake.

710
00:38:32.186 --> 00:38:33.561
I'm trying not to.

711

- Not really.
- Yes, I am!

00:38:35.105 --> 00:38:38.900
If you're going to cave every
time he pays attention to you...

713
00:38:38.901 --> 00:38:40.276
leave me out of it.

853
00:45:56.672 --> 00:45:59.340

854
00:45:59.341 --> 00:46:01.884
Well, not me! So he must
be cheating on both of us.

Oh, my God, that's it!
He's cheating on us!

If he's not seeing you... I'm so
sorry I said that, that sucks...

858
00:46:10.060 --> 00:46:13.729
but if he isn't seeing you,
he's seeing someone else.

Think about it. Between
the two of us...

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:19.527
he has the perfect woman.
What else would he need?

not giving him... sex.

smell amazing. What is that?

is, you seem so nice...

you were the devil.

then asked for a divorce.

What an asshole!

Who cares what he says?

1026

Because it's not fair.

1027

He made me the bad guy.
And he's divorcing me?

happening, right?

and he picks that?

for fake-cheating?

01:15:36.241 --> 01:15:39.285
Well, it's going to suck
for a little while.

1381
01:15:39.286 --> 01:15:41.688
Then it's going to
suck a little less.

1382
01:15:41.788 --> 01:15:45.859
And then one day that
ring will just be a ring.

1383

be something you used to wear.

- It's pretty.
- You do?

"I wish I had a costume!"

- No. Not really.
- No?

Kate, you remember
my partner, Nick.

1417

Yes! Hi. It's been ages.

Good to see you again.

This is Cece. Kate's the one who
had the idea for SwipeSwitch.com.

- She's my little idea factory.
- (LAUGHS)

1424
01:17:50.458 --> 01:17:52.543
Maybe you should ask her
about ServiceCircuit.

1425
01:17:52.544 --> 01:17:54.086
Is that still circling the drain?

1426
01:17:54.087 --> 01:17:58.299
More like the toilet. But the potential's
there... we could make it work.

1428
01:18:00.427 --> 01:18:01.869
Two million.

We'll talk about it.

1430
01:18:04.973 --> 01:18:07.641
But if two million doesn't
work, we shut it down.

Thanks. I appreciate it.

Remember how tiny it was?

And we had the bathroom
in the kitchen?

It just seems like everything
was so simple then. You know?

was supposed to have sex with him.

- You saw him?
- He came over after work

1481
01:20:19.977 --> 01:20:22.557
- and he had his computer with him.
- Did you have sex?

1482

No! I know I said I would, but you
looked so sad when I won, I couldn't.

said I had Chlamydia!

That's right, bitch! Chlamydia!

1485
01:20:32.954 --> 01:20:35.523
He can't have sex till
he finishes his Z-Pak!

CARLY: Mark's not just a cheating
scumbag. He's also a thief.

1487

Look what I found. This is a list
of all the start-up companies...

1488
01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:46.091
Mark's invested in. Three are
offshore and one's a blind filing.

1489
01:20:46.092 --> 01:20:49.762
No board of directors,
a P.O. box for an address...

1490
01:20:49.763 --> 01:20:52.389
and it's been operating at a
total loss in the Bahamas.

1492
01:20:54.309 --> 01:20:57.561
That can't be right. Mark was talking
about ServiceCircuit last night.

1493
01:20:57.562 --> 01:20:59.480
They're putting more money into it.

1494

That's part of the con.

1495
01:21:00.982 --> 01:21:03.942
- We just need to find the bank he's using.
- KATE: I was with the board last night.

1496
01:21:03.943 --> 01:21:07.112
They seem really happy.
Mark is making them rich!

1497
01:21:07.113 --> 01:21:10.991
He's stealing, Kate. Making money
for them is the way he does it.

1498
01:21:10.992 --> 01:21:12.852
Kate, what's going on?

1499
01:21:12.994 --> 01:21:17.398
Nothing. I just think it's more
complicated than we thought.

1500
01:21:18.792 --> 01:21:20.626
You slept with him, didn't you.

1501
01:21:20.627 --> 01:21:23.170
One night, and you go
back to being a Stepford?

He must have literally
screwed your brains out!

1504
01:21:27.467 --> 01:21:31.178
So what? Maybe you just have to forgive
people in order to move forward.

1505
01:21:31.179 --> 01:21:33.138
But he didn't ask for
forgiveness, did he?

1506
01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:36.016
If you had something to lose,
you'd understand how hard this is.

- Both of you, stop.

- Seeing if Mark wants to hang out.

- What's wrong with you?
- KATE: Everything!

Everything is wrong with you.

1513
01:21:54.285 --> 01:21:59.899

trusting you over him. I am done!

No. And I feel like if Amber
won't talk to me, then...

lot of it, but some.

He gave me a Z-Pak.

around, and you should take one, too.

01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:25.300
AMBER: Though we did have to
significantly reduce your share.

1717

(MARK STUTTERING)

1718
01:38:29.655 --> 01:38:33.199
What is this? Why does it say zero?
Why's that even on here?

1719
01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:36.494
- The money you stole from ServiceCircuit?
- I don't know anything about that.

1720
01:38:36.495 --> 01:38:38.871
KATE: That's funny, neither
did I. But apparently...

1721
01:38:38.872 --> 01:38:42.875
I'm the CEO. I'm the CEO of
several companies, actually.

1722
01:38:42.876 --> 01:38:45.211
But sadly, I had to empty those
accounts, so you're broke.

1723
01:38:45.212 --> 01:38:48.047
(STAMMERING) Empty? What are
you talking about? How...?

1724
01:38:48.048 --> 01:38:49.757
CARLY: We looked. That's how.

1725
01:38:49.758 --> 01:38:51.843
That's what happens when
you piss people off.

1726
01:38:51.844 --> 01:38:56.347
What? You robbed me.
You three girls robbed me.

1727
01:38:56.348 --> 01:38:58.391
No way! I don't buy it.

1728
01:38:58.392 --> 01:39:01.352
You don't have it in you
to rip me off. No way.

1729
01:39:01.353 --> 01:39:03.187
- You sure about that?
- Yes!

1730
01:39:03.188 --> 01:39:08.093
Didn't you notice our skin?
That nice Bahamian glow?

1731
01:39:08.527 --> 01:39:10.862
- Incredible.
- He didn't even notice!

1732
01:39:10.863 --> 01:39:12.405
MARK: Honestly, Katie...

1733
01:39:12.406 --> 01:39:14.657
I don't know what's
going on with you,

1734
01:39:14.658 --> 01:39:17.034
but for your sake,
I hope you're lying.

1735
01:39:17.035 --> 01:39:19.745
It's your signature all
over those contracts.

1736
01:39:19.746 --> 01:39:22.748
It's you who's liable. So
don't threaten me, honey.

1737
01:39:22.749 --> 01:39:26.878
Because if you did empty those accounts,
you're the one going down, not me.

1738
01:39:26.879 --> 01:39:30.214
We thought you might say that.
Then Carly explained...

1739
01:39:30.215 --> 01:39:32.425
a concept called restitution.

1740
01:39:32.426 --> 01:39:35.328
Think of it as payback. That's
how we framed it with Nick.

1741
01:39:35.429 --> 01:39:37.430
(INTERCOM BEEPING)
You framed it with Nick, now?

1742
01:39:37.431 --> 01:39:40.766
You included Nick? Bullshit!
Now I know you're...

1743
01:39:40.767 --> 01:39:44.838
Hey, Nick! Hey, man! I... What?

1744
01:39:46.607 --> 01:39:48.941
I don't know what they told you.

1745
01:39:48.942 --> 01:39:51.569
They're having some kind
of group breakdown.

1746
01:39:51.570 --> 01:39:54.180
They didn't tell me anything.
They showed me.

1747
01:39:54.281 --> 01:39:58.284
It's over. I'm getting my ideas
direct from the factory now.

1748
01:39:58.285 --> 01:40:03.080
What? From her?! Is this some
kind of joke? You're firing me?

1749
01:40:03.081 --> 01:40:07.084
Firing you is the least of it. The only
reason you're not going to prison...

1750
01:40:07.085 --> 01:40:09.462
is because your wife
paid all the money back.

1751
01:40:09.463 --> 01:40:12.632
Oh, no, no, no. You're all lying.

1752
01:40:12.633 --> 01:40:17.261
It's bullshit. It's bullshit!
Global bullshit! I call bullshit!

1753
01:40:17.262 --> 01:40:18.804
Bullshit!

1754
01:40:18.805 --> 01:40:20.932
My wife's not some
criminal mastermind.

1755
01:40:20.933 --> 01:40:25.170
She needs freakin' brain camp!
That's my money!

Mark, you're not a
very nice person.

Shut up!

Hey, buddy! I'm here! Stop!

- It's already hooked.
- Come on. It's barely in the red!

- I guess you can afford it, then.

every part of you.
