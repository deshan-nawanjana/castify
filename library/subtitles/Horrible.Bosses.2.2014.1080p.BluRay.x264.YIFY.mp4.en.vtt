00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.620
Hey, hey. If you're coming in
for the morning grind...

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.460
it's another brutal Monday
out there traffic-wise.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.380
The 2 is slow-and-go to the 5.
A Sig Alert is bogging down the I-10.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.460
And if you're on the 405 freeway,
you're probably already late for work.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.380
If your boss gives you a hard time about it,
have him come down here and talk to...

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.580
- ...Rachel.
- Oh, no.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.460
Zing! Ha, ha. Thanks, Skip.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.140
But, hey, speaking of bosses,
after the break...

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.020
we get to meet three guys who are chasing
their dream of becoming their own bosses.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.220
Stay with us.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.700
And we're out. Very good, guys.
We're back in 90 seconds.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.580
Jesus Christ.
Dale, you gotta stop sweating, pal.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.820
- Oh, wow, you are wet.
- "Stop sweating." How do I stop sweating?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.540
This is a big deal.
We got everything riding on this.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.380
We've quit our jobs, I have three children
to think about now. How about that?

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.266
Think about this. You do a good job now,
you're gonna make your boys very proud.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.580
- Girls. I have three girls, dude.
- Right. You can't even tell at that age.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.140
- They basically look like potatoes with arms.
- Don't call my kids potatoes.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.100
- Respect the kids.
- Don't piss him off.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.700
- They wear pink!
- Calm him down.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.460
A lot of guys wear pink.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.820
- I have a pink polo shirt that I love.
- Come on.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.820
- Can we get a roll of paper towels?
- Can I get paper towels?!

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.300
Why are you barking at people?
He's saying please, you're just barking.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.180
- Bad manners.
- Buddy, dry your face.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.140
- He's freaking out.
- It's unbelievable.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.540
- Can you go on without me?
- Why don't you wait in the car?

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.060
Stop, this is gonna be easy.
You have to calm down.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.060
Look, Nick's gonna hit them with facts
and figures, because he's the brains, right?

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.860
You talk about how you and your wife fucked
and made three potatoes with arms.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:21.060
You're the heart. Me,
I'll do my thing, get in where I fit in.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.300
- You're the soul?
- No, I'm the dick and balls.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.380
- Got it.
- Why would I wanna be the soul?

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:28.980
- Just don't pass out. Just keep breathing.
- See? This will be easy.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.700
- All we have to do is be ourselves.
- Let's not. Ourselves is a Dumpster fire.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.140
- Let's be better. Let's try to elevate a little.
- That's a good note. Nobody be themselves.

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.220
All right, we're back in 20 seconds.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.180
Hey, fellas, thanks for coming.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.420
- Nice to meet you.
- Good morning. How are you?

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.780
Hey, my man. There's trouble.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.660
- Too much.
- Well, he went with it.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.140
- Dale Arbus.
- Pleasure to meet you, man.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.500
- Thanks for coming on. This will be fun.
- Yeah.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.350
Does that zip all the way down?

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.940
And we're back in five, four...

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.500
Get up, get up, get up, and get out

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.820
And we're back. You know,
every week we like to highlight...

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.980
local inventors and entrepreneurs
in our Big Idea Spotlight.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.180
That's right, Mike.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.303
And today we have three modern-day...

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.260
Edisons who've created a new shower gadget
they hope to really clean up with.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.700
Please, welcome Nick, Kurt and Dale.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.460
- Pleasure to be here.
- Before we get to the product, can you tell us...

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.660
what is it that inspired three regular
Joes to go into business for yourselves?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.900
We were all working at pretty
terrible jobs for some awful bosses.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.820
And thought if we got a chance to be our
own bosses, we'd do things differently.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.220
This might be our shot.

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.460
We didn't think we'd get the chance,
but Dale had an amazing idea.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.700
Don't go to Dale.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:47.740
And, we started meeting together
to talk about the invention...

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.860
instead of complaining about our jobs.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.340
Hey, I think that's exciting.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:55.700
Dale, you know, I just wanna know,
where did the idea come from...

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.580
- ...for a new showerhead?
- I have three kids.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.340
So that's the heart.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.060
- That's a blessing.
- Yeah, well, he has triplets.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.340
In all honesty, it's too many.
I'm pretty overwhelmed.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.700
Well, he's got them
on his mind, clearly.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.220
Let me answer the question.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.620
Dale, had just gotten back from one
of those self-service car washes...

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:16.860
- ...with the wand with the soap.
- It's got everything in one thing.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.860
He thought, "Why don't they make
one of these for your body?"

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.740
After we had a few beers,
we came up with the, Shower Buddy.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.700
- The Shower Buddy?
- I'm sorry, that name's not official yet.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.740
- No, he's wrong. It is official.
- I wanted the "Shower Daddy."

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.260
- "Shower Daddy" is worse on every level.
- I have to agree with Nick.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.540
Better than having
some strange dude with you.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.940
It's not some strange dude,
as I've said many times. It's your buddy.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.860
- Why would your buddy be in the shower?
- Why would your dad?

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.420
Don't scream on television.

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.740
You know what? How about you fellas
show us how this gizmo works?

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.831
- Right? Let's get it going.
- Yes. Make it rain. Yes. Work it, work it.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.940
Oh, this is awesome.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.340
Kurt's gonna turn on the shower.
You're gonna see the water come out.

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.780
After a bit, the shampoo's gonna automatically
be triggered out of the showerhead...

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.620
- No water pressure.
- The blue handle.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.980
- No water pressure.
- There's a pump on the back.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.420
- I could pump it manually.
- Dale's gonna help out. Thank you, buddy.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.140
- Pump.
- You got it?

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.300
- I got it.
- Yeah?

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.220
Water comes out,
the shampoo mixes with the water...

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.260
then shortly after that, conditioner.

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.820
You shower in half the time
with the Shower Buddy.

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:23.184
The average American... I don't know if you
know this.... spends 50 hours a week working.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.540
- Hand's cramping up.
- Here, let me help.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.300
...commuting.
If we can save you just five minutes...

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.106
- The whole rod's too dry, right?
- Yeah, spit on it.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.140
- Better?
- See, yeah. If you lube it up, it's better.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.660
Oh, no, absolutely.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.060
I'm sorry. There's a hole in the back.
I'm gonna stick my finger in it.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.740
We don't really care how you get it done.
Just get it done. Get it finished.

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.780
- Whatever it takes.
- Live TV, right?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.660
Live TV. What are you gonna do?

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.500
- Yeah. Here we go.
- Oh, here it comes.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.220
Hey!

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.460
- I told you.
- Works just as promised, okay?

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.660
- Now, go ahead and shut it off.
- It's so cool. I want one.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:01.780
You can't have this one. It's the prototype.
But we're looking for partners.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.180
I'll tell you right now. I'm sold.
I wanna invest.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:06.100
We got one. All right, Mike.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.340
Now, how would I get
in touch with you guys?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.780
- You go straight to Nickkurtdale.
- I'm sorry, what?

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.823
It's our website. Nickkurtdale. com.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.907
I'm positive I'm not hearing that right.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:19.109
It's our names: Nick, Kurt, Dale.

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.663
Nickkurtdale.

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.582
Y'all gotta change that name.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.540
Cannot believe
we never said it out loud before.

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.700
It looked so good on paper.

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.100
It was a nice dream while it lasted, but I think
it's time we all go beg for our jobs back.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:38.540
Maybe just accept the fact that we'll
always be cogs in the machine.

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.100
Wait. Cocks in the machine.
What is that?

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.620
"Cogs." Guh.

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:45.500
You know what? You're right.
We're not boss material.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.220
We're worker bees. We're grunts.

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.900
Oh, boy. That song. I can't hear
that now. Just put it on vibrate.

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.100
- Will you stop?
- Please?

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.020
- I picked this song to inspire us.
- It's not inspiring me.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.740
Look at this. Unknown caller.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.180
- Just answer it.
- Hello?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.265
Yup, this is one of the
Shower Buddy guys.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.020
Really? Yes. No, of course.
I know exactly who you are.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.860
Look up "Boulder Stream."
Boulder Stream.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.660
Thank you.
We're very proud of the product.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.940
- E-mail us the details, that'll be fine.
- Is that a real thing?

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.700
- Yeah, my e-mail?
- Not yours.

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:18.580
Yeah, it's phatballllz@hotmail.com.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:22.980
It's P-H-A-T-B-A-L-L...

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.184
L-L-Z...

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.500
@hotmail.com.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.060
Yeah. All right. Thank you. Yeah.

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.460
- See you tomorrow.
- Wow.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.140
Holy shit.
Boulder Stream loves the Shower Buddy.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.820
Who the fuck is Boulder Stream?

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:38.388
Only one of the largest
catalog retailers in North America.

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.902
You're gonna hear me roar

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.380
Nice.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:47.540
When you're in a good mood,
it's a good song. Bad mood, bad song.

00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.151
That's art. That's good art.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.780
- Man, this place is legit.
- Yeah, it's nice.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.580
- Did you see the free cookies?
- Yeah, you clearly have. That's four of those.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.140
- You're gonna have chocolate on your face.
- When we meet this guy...

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.420
when you shake his hand,
use your other hand and touch his elbow.

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.220
- It's a classy move.
- I don't know this move. Let me see.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.980
- Like that.
- Please, both sit down.

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.940
- That's nice.
- How about that? Not bad.

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.700
- That's really good.
- You got chocolate on your fingers.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.020
Now it's on my jacket.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.020
- Put water on it.
- I don't need water. That will set it.

00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:22.380
- Get the cookie away from me.
- No, it's like a fire-on-fire thing.

00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.620
No, the water will set it.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.340
Ha! There they are.
There are my shower buddies.

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.980
How are you? In the flesh.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.460
It's just like on that morning show.
You're always fighting. I love it.

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.060
- Yeah, it's a...
- Rex Hanson.

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:35.140
- Oh, hey. Kurt Buckman.
- Good to see you.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:36.940
- Nice to see you.
- Classy handshake.

00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:38.710
- Nick Hendricks.
- Nick, pleasure.

00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:40.180
Hey, Dale Arb...

00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.820
- Shoot. I just learned it.
- We can do it whichever way you want.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:46.740
- Right?
- To be clear, we're not racist.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:48.580
Well, that's good. We can use that.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.900
Why don't we grab the refreshments, coffee?
Grab some cookies.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.260
Let's head upstairs. Let's talk
about this product. Is that corduroy?

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.780
Step inside. Dreams do come true.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.580
You guys want something to drink?

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.020
- I'll take one.
- Sure.

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.780
- No. It's very early.
- No for us. Sorry.

00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:08.860
I'm gonna cut right to it, gentlemen.
The Shower Buddy: a home run.

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:11.420
Well, Mr. Hanson,
we couldn't be happier...

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.020
Mr. Hanson is my father. It's "Rex."

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.100
Please, sit down. Get comfortable.
Take a seat.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:22.380
We want you to know that we are a company
you can be very proud to be in business with.

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.460
- Our workers are all gonna have health care...
- I don't really give a shit about that.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:29.425
Do you see this?
This is Jimi Hendrix's actual guitar.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.580
Yeah. The one he did the fire and fingers
thing with. You like cool shit like this?

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.620
- We love cool shit.
- I'm into cool shit.

00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.220
- You like fucking samurais?
- Samurais? Sure.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.742
I knew you did. Get into business with me,
you're gonna have fucking loads of it.

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:46.180
- So you are offering to carry our product...?
- Wait a minute. Check this out.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.540
Miss Lang, will you
come in here a moment?

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.071
Now what?

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.991
Jesus fucking Christ.

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.740
Sweetheart, we were racking our brains.
What's a beer can made out of?

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.351
Do you mean aluminum?

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.826
- That'll be all, Miss Lang. Thank you.
- Okay.

00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:06.300
And where does she go now?

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.060
Now, that is the kind of cool shit
you have to look forward to.

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:13.300
Best part about this deal:
you're not gonna have to lift a finger.

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.180
My company will assume
all future product development...

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.060
outsource manufacturing to China...

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.780
and you receive a handsome one-time
development fee.

00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:24.220
- I wanna dig in on the one-time fee because...
- You see this football?

00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:28.345
This is the one Peyton Manning threw
and the guy caught it in his helmet. Keep it.

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:33.260
You know, Rex, the one-time fee thing, we're
not looking to give up control of the company.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.940
Right. We wanna handle all the manufacturing
and you guys do distribution.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.700
What, you manufacture? Here, in America?

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.100
- That's the plan.
- The American-dream thing.

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.820
Boys, I hate to break it to you,
but the American dream, it's made in China.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:48.420
Now, look, I respect your naïveté...

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:51.860
but I'm afraid that this deal
only happens one way.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:54.020
I did say "handsome fee," right?

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.980
Can I have one minute?
Just love to talk to my partners.

00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.865
You got it. Take your time.
I'll be over here.

00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.340
- Oh, boy.
- Man.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.900
- What do you think?
- I didn't wanna say anything...

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.300
but he means Eli Manning,
not Peyton Manning.

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:12.340
- Yeah. Maybe. Maybe. Kurt.
- I think she has an amazing fucking body...

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:15.540
but that accent puts her over the top.
It's insane. That dress.

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.780
Agreed on both points.
How about the deal?

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.020
- The deal. Gotta take it.
- We should take it.

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.580
- Take the money and get out.
- He's got cool shit.

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.500
- Imagine having your own cool shit.
- But look at this place.

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.220
I mean, these guys make loads
of money selling stuff...

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.740
and he just called our
Shower Buddy a home run.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.420
- Why sell a home run for a one-time fee?
- That's a good point.

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.380
I don't know. I could use
the money for Stacy and the girls.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.980
That's a good point. That's true.
I could use money.

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:42.660
I get that.
But maybe it's not just about the money.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.980
That's a good point.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.100
Maybe it's about never having to work
for anybody ever again.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.500
- That's right.
- Right? Being our own bosses.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.420
- I say we bet on ourselves.
- Me too.

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:52.660
- You're right.
- I'm in.

00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:53.980
I'm in. Let's do it.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.420
Okay. Rex. Ahem.

00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.380
- No deal.
- Sorry.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:00.740
- We're, betting on ourselves.
- Is that right?

00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.140
Yeah. And no hard feelings.
Honestly, we really appreciate the offer.

00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.583
- Sorry.
- Yeah. I can respect that.

00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:10.620
Takes some serious balls to walk away
from 3 million bucks.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:13.060
Hang on. Three million dollars?
We'll take that.

00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.700
Sorry. Offer's off the table.

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.100
We'll take half. Half is fine.
Can we have half?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.420
Ship's sailed.
Thank you so much for coming in.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.660
Dale, I'm gonna need that ball back.
Good luck building something in America.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.664
You know...

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:30.580
I built this company from
the bottom up here in America.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:34.820
- Dad, I didn't know you were back.
- What'd I tell you about using my office?

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.300
- I know, I just thought, you know...
- Bert Hanson.

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.820
You're the Shower Buddy guys?

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.540
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah. We are, sir.

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:46.500
I respect you gentlemen for wanting to
roll up your sleeves and build something...

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.700
stake your claim.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.506
Now, I came to
this country with nothing.

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.620
And through risk and hard work,
I made my own American dream come true.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.542
- Good for you.
- Well, here's what I'm gonna do.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.980
I'll refer you to my contact
at Pacific Shore National.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:09.140
- That's a bank.
- They won't balk at giving you a loan...

00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:14.744
once they hear that Bert Hanson just has
placed an initial order of, say...

00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:18.820
100,000 units?

00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:21.300
- A hundred-thousand Shower Buddies?
- Whoa. Ha!

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.380
You're gonna make
100,000 Shower Buddies?

00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.545
Dad, what are you talking about?
We never make this kind of deal.

00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:29.866
I'm sorry, sir.

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:34.540
But Boulder Stream needs
to be your exclusive retailer.

00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:38.820
- Let's think it over. Of course.
- We won't pick up the phone if anyone calls.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.540
- We have a deal?
- Yeah, you got a fucking deal.

00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:44.940
- Hey, all right. There it is.
- I got his elbow. Yeah.

00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:47.980
- I got some chocolate on you there.
- It doesn't matter.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.990
That's great. That is good news.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:55.500
So it's 20,000 square feet,
but it's a minimum five-year lease.

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:58.340
Twenty thousand. That sounds
like a lot more than we need.

00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.660
But we want something
we can grow into, right?

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.148
- And we have a really big order, Nick.
- Damn straight. Come on, Nick.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.140
- Nick. Nick.
- I don't know.

00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.741
- You know, I say we take it. I say we take it.
- Yes.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.740
- Yes, we do.
- Excellent.

00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:47.700
You've got no work experience at all.

00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.020
Is that bad?

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.540
Are you kidding? It's great.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.380
- You're enthusiastic and you're unjaded.
- And unqualified.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.700
- You know what? You're hired.
- Oops.

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:59.746
- Really?
- That was unexpected and, undeserving.

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:11.947
You're hired.

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.106
That's a yes. That's an obvious yes.

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.821
- Well, again...
- No résumé at all.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.540
Don't need it. Your eyes speak.
You seem honest.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:25.740
Hold on, pal.

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:27.860
- You're hired.
- Really?

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.142
- I mean, if you'll have us.
- Thank you.

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:31.620
- Becoming faster now.
- Well...

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.700
- Can you start on Saturday evening?
- Absolutely.

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.500
Okay, great, I'll get ahold of you.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.780
- Says here you've been convicted of a felony.
- That was bullshit.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:43.020
Word up, though, I get that, man.
Like, pfft, I had a similar thing.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.300
They tried to peg me as a child
sex offender. It was total bullshit.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.300
Oh, yo, yo, yo.
I ain't down with no kid-fuckers.

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.460
- I'm not down with kid shit either.
- Yeah, none of us are.

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.260
N-to-the-O, brother.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.660
We do not support that at all.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:16:01.741
But, you know, let's just give the guy a job.
Just... Yeah. I don't wanna upset this guy.

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.980
Well, tell you what, Tiffany.
You're hired.

00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.340
- I'm hired?
- Yeah, you are.

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:08.940
- There you go. There you go.
- Oh, thank you.

00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.820
We'll see you later. See you Monday.
Get out of here.

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.420
Kurt, you gotta stop hiring
hot unqualified women.

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:17.300
What's the point of being boss
if you can't stock the pond?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:20.140
You realize you can't sleep
with these women?

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.180
- What?
- You're the boss. It's sexual harassment.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:25.340
Remember sexual harassment?
I tried to kill my boss. Ring a bell?

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:27.620
I gotta fire them all now?
We just hired them.

00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.860
You can't fire them because you're not
allowed to sleep with them.

00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.141
Also sexual harassment.

00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:35.469
Why are we even doing this, then?

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.542
All right, let's talk dress code.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.900
- Forget it.
- There is no dress code.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.660
- Come on.
- You can dress however you want.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:48.340
Whatever makes you feel comfortable...
Well, there goes a shirt. All right.

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.700
- It's a choice.
- Well...

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.180
That's the wrong choice, though.
Gotta wear a shirt. That's the one...

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:56.589
He's walking away from me.
He might have been a bad hire.

00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:06.060
Who's having fun?

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.340
Hey, guys.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.900
Everybody seems very happy.
This was a great idea.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.467
Yeah, I know.
This could be an issue, though.

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.140
It is Bring Your Kids to Work Day,
not Put Your Kids to Work Day.

00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.620
They're not working.
They consider this playing.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.580
I tried to tell them to stop,
and they started crying.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:25.580
- They have boxed 1200 units already.
- Unethical... 1200?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.580
- Yeah.
- Well, that's productive, though.

00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:29.580
- Yeah.
- And they seem happy.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.540
- Let them play another ten minutes, maybe.
- I say we let them play through lunch.

00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.141
- Yeah. Legally I think I'll change the sign.
- Yeah.

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.060
Oh, boy. This is it.

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:43.830
Here we go. Here we go.

00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:00.940
- We did it. We're at 100,000.
- We did it?

00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:03.188
- Yeah.
- Let me see.

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.220
Woo-hoo-hoo!

00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:08.180
- This is a great idea.
- How do you think they mow this?

00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:11.260
- Sure we shouldn't have called ahead?
- No. He's gonna love it.

00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.740
Cake and balloons.
Don't think that's overdoing it?

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.140
No. I think he's gonna be psyched
the order's done three days early.

00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.180
I think he's gonna be flipping out
to see us out on his course.

00:18:20.280 --> 00:18:22.980
I wouldn't be surprised
if he gives us a membership.

00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:24.340
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.747
Oh, my God. I want that.

00:18:28.600 --> 00:18:29.860
Yeah!

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:31.260
Surprise. Ha, ha.

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:34.350
Sir, we finished your order
and it is ready to be shipped.

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:36.300
Excellent news.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:39.620
We got you a little cake that says,
"Thanks for believing in us!"

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:42.020
- And some balloons of course.
- We're the "us."

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:44.700
Congratulations, boys.
What an accomplishment.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.391
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

00:18:47.080 --> 00:18:49.420
I'm afraid I'm gonna have
to cancel that order.

00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.820
What'd he say?

00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.460
- Sounded like he said "cancel the order."
- What?

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.231
- Cancel what?
- Cancel the order.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.980
Don't need it.

00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.500
- Wait, no. That doesn't work.
- You can't do that.

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:03.510
- We went 500 grand in the hole.
- We were in business.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.340
- If you don't buy, we are ruined.
- It's a $500,000 order.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:11.101
- The American dream and all that.
- He's gonna putt. He's just gonna putt.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.180
- He makes the putt.
- Can you explain what's happening?

00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.260
- And why you're doing this?
- Yeah, sure. Fair question.

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.180
You see, boys, in one week
your bridge loan comes due...

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.980
and you won't be able to pay it.

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:26.620
And your loan officer has assured me
no extension will be granted.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:29.780
At that moment, your company
will go into foreclosure...

00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.420
and I will buy all of those units at auction
for pennies on the dollar.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.100
Cheaper than I could have gotten them
from the Chinese.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.340
- Oh, my fucking God.
- I can't believe this.

00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.260
Anyway, as an added bonus,
I will also own your patent...

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:44.900
and these gentlemen here will take over
manufacturing of our new product:

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:46.420
The Shower Pal.

00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.060
- It's a better name too.
- It is.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:49.580
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking hell.

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:53.140
Oh, Dad, that is a hell
of a fucking play.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:57.340
We should fit these guys for crowns
because they just got fucked royally.

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.340
Rex. No call for this MTV showboating.
They're aware of their defeat.

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.749
In these moments,
it's more impactful to be still.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.780
What about that stuff about hard work
and starting a company in America?

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.180
- The American dream and hard work.
- All bullshit?

00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.460
You honestly think
hard work creates wealth?

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:21.700
The only thing that creates
wealth is wealth.

00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.460
And we have it. You don't.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.140
Okay. Okay. You know what?

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:29.662
- Take it easy. Take it easy.
- I got it. Hey.

00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:33.460
Listen, bucko. You don't wanna
make enemies out of us, okay?

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.988
Whoa, easy. I didn't walk all up on you.

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:42.463
I make new enemies every day.
It's called business.

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.420
Thank you, gentlemen, for stopping by.
Have a lovely day.

00:20:48.520 --> 00:20:49.860
Rex, get the cake.

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.300
Rich motherfucking,
overprivileged, fucking assholes.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.300
What happened to decency?

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.900
- I'm gonna lose my house.
- Yeah.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.540
Stacy's gonna divorce me.
She's gonna marry some dude.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.660
- I'll have supervised visits at McDonald's.
- Fucking McDonald's.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:09.980
What were we thinking? Who bets
on themselves? Why did we do that?

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.500
- What?
- You're the one who talked me into it.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:13.980
I was on the fence.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:18.340
We're fucked! Our employees are fucked.
What about them? What about Lupe?

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.300
This is just a problem. That means all
we gotta do is come up with a solution.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.180
We'll put some ideas up on the board.

00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.060
That's what I'm talking about.
Here we go. Let's go.

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:30.180
- No idea's a bad idea.
- No idea's a bad idea.

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:32.064
- Who's gonna start us off?
- I got it.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:33.940
- Kurt.
- Kill these motherfuckers.

00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.180
- No, no.
- Murder! Yes.

00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.580
- You don't need to write that down.
- Kill them.

00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.351
- Let's fucking kill them! I want them dead!
- Kill them.

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:45.149
- We open up their brains and shove them...
- Then we fuck the skulls!

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.500
- I'm getting that taste, Nick.
- They're fucking dead!

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:52.020
- We're fucking doing it again!
- That's the Chicago way!

00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.580
- Chicago way!
- Cut them open. I want his family dead.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.545
I want his house burned down,
and I'll get a baseball bat.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.180
- Come on, man, come on.
- Fuck their skulls!

00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.586
- Come on.
- Come on.

00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.540
We'll fucking kill them.

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.700
If we've learned one thing about
ourselves, it's that we're not murderers.

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.580
- How does killing them get us our money?
- What do you mean?

00:22:11.680 --> 00:22:14.300
You harvest their organs,
sell them on the black market.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.580
Be fucking serious. Come on.
This is not helpful. Think seriously.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.340
You're right. There's other
things people have done.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.900
- There's plots.
- For money.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.500
- The plot of the movie Speed.
- Yes, there you go. Put a bomb on a bus.

00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:29.180
So we'll rig a bus so that when it goes
below 50 miles an hour, it blows up.

00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:31.940
- What the fuck is that?
- You said no idea was a bad idea.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.940
I was wrong. That idea sucks,
the movie sucks and so do you.

00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:37.420
That movie introduced us
to Sandy Bullock.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:40.180
Fuck you! I love Sandra Bullock!
I'm running hot.

00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:43.420
I'm sorry. I'm running hot.
The whole fucking thing's got me upset.

00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:45.540
Give me the marker,
I'll get a better idea.

00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:48.220
Want the marker?
Give me $500,000, that's what we need.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.900
- Gonna hold the marker ransom?
- Call it what you want.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.940
I need a half a million dollars. I don't
need shit ideas and a bunch of hot air.

00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.660
Come on.

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.305
Dale.

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.380
- Boom. Marker drop.
- "Kidnaping."

00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.620
- That's "kidnapping."
- With one more P it is. That's "kidnaping."

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.660
However the fuck you spell it. You know what
I'm talking about. Kidnapping. Come on.

00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:16.260
Wait a second. That's a fucking great idea.
Think about it. First of all, we kidnap Rex.

00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:18.220
- We get money from Bert.
- Ransom money.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.380
We save the business.

00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:20.540
No one has to die.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:22.620
- Nobody gets hurt.
- He is the kid of Bert.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.300
Right, but he's not super young.

00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:27.580
- So it's not super douchey and shit.
- It's not all molesty and shit.

00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.780
What do you know
about executing a kidnapping?

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.586
- What do you mean? You just...
- You get zip ties.

00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.780
You don't know shit about kidnapping.

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:39.340
Okay, we don't know a ton.
But I bet we know someone that does.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.180
- Who?
- Motherfucker Jones.

00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:44.900
- Oh, Jesus.
- Wouldn't it be good to see him?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.820
We're not gonna go see Motherfucker Jones
because we're not gonna "kidnape" anyone.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.940
Come on, this guy's
a master business prick.

00:23:53.040 --> 00:23:55.871
He's at the top of his game.
We need to figure out...

00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:00.502
Boy, look what we got.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:02.940
Is that a Sharpie?

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.860
- Hang on. What was a Sharpie doing there?
- You put it there.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.020
I did put it on there.

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.064
- You're in charge of marker distribution.
- I know I'm the marker guy.

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.780
Permanently on the board now.

00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:16.340
This illustrates my point, idiots.
We need to find somebody who's legitimate.

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:20.022
We need to find someone
who can get us our company back.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.541
Hello, Nick...

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:38.266
guy who saved my life...

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:40.220
guy who fucked my wife.

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.344
It was a blow job. It was
a blowjob, only. Didn't fuck her.

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.700
You got my e-mail?

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:47.900
I did. And I was very amused by it.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.220
I know Bert Hanson.
I like the cut of his jib.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:56.220
And I admire the way he bent you three idiots
over a barrel and showed you the 50 states.

00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:58.900
- See? Told you it was a saying.
- Wow.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.340
Now, Nick, just tell me something.

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:05.620
Why would you start production...

00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:09.540
without at least a guarantee
of 35 percent down...

00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:11.700
to cover manufacturing costs?

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.100
I mean, why would you do that?

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:17.667
- Is he telling a joke?
- Is something funny?

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:22.140
We assumed that we were dealing
with somebody who was ethical...

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:26.260
No, that's the wrong answer.
The right answer is because...

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:30.067
you're all fucking morons.

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.220
Boy, he shined a light on that, didn't he?
That's true. You're absolutely right.

00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.980
You thought I was such a bad boss.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.540
But, I don't know, I think running
your own company into the ground...

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:44.100
ruining the livelihood of your employees
is maybe a bit worse. What do you think?

00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.100
- That's fair.
- Should I be on the phone if I'm taking notes?

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:51.140
- I'm not getting any of what he's saying.
- It's just a lot of rhetorical questions.

00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:53.263
So, what do you want from me, Nick?

00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:57.300
With all due respect, you know
what makes a guy like that tick.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.740
So if you could give us some advice
on how to get our money back...

00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.865
I will play real nice at your next
parole hearing. How does that sound?

00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.661
- You would do that for me?
- Yes, I would.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.900
Okay. I think I can help you.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.980
He's gonna help? Okay, I got a notepad.
I got a notepad.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.540
From a legal standpoint...

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.820
"Legal standpoint."

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.580
...your options are...

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:21.460
- "Options are..."
- Legal options.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.980
...jack fucking shit.

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.420
I heard "Jack Leibowitz."
Is that an attorney?

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:29.100
- I'll write that down.
- Can we get his contact info?

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.620
Even if you had the money
to fight him in the courts...

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.060
his lawyers are just gonna
file motions and continuances...

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:39.860
long after you three pissant
little fuckups...

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:42.060
have blown your tiny little brains out.

00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:43.740
You saying nothing can be done?

00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.060
No, I said there's nothing you can do.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:49.580
There's plenty that could be done,
but you won't do it.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.660
- And do you wanna know why?
- No, not really.

00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.940
- Because you have no balls.
- I see.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.940
And your fathers had no balls.

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:01.060
You are all a product of
generations of ball-less men...

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.740
who were too weak or too frightened
to stand up and take what was theirs.

00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.460
And one day, you will pass on...

00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:12.460
your empty, shriveled sacs
to your own pitiful offspring.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.500
- I can't hear. What is he talking about?
- Our nut sacs, mostly.

00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.660
How'd that come up?

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:19.780
- Why don't you pitch him the kidnapping?
- Let the kidnapping go.

00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:22.580
- Pitch him the kidnapping.
- Show some balls, all right?

00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.260
Wanna see balls? Kidnap someone.

00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.060
You'll end up in here. You'll see
plenty of balls on your forehead.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.060
Why are they on my forehead?

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.340
- Was the dick on top of my head?
- Makes no sense.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.350
- Oh, I'm upside down.
- You sure are. Your face is getting fucked.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.700
Motherfucker.

00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:55.900
So y'all plan to use
the ransom to save your business.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.500
- Exactly, yeah. That's it.
- That's what we're hoping.

00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:01.590
Will you tell these idiots
how stupid that is, please?

00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.940
I like it.

00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.620
- Nice. See?
- I knew he'd like it.

00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:07.580
You're doing what you need to
to keep your business going.

00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.180
I had a dream for a long time
to get my own business.

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.381
Yeah.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.020
I wanted to open my own Pinkberry.

00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.020
- What the fuck is the chuckles about?
- Oh, I thought you were joking.

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.940
See how many crackers line up to get
that Captain Crunch-covered freezing shit?

00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.900
- I eat it three times a week. I love Pinkberry.
- Hey, that's awesome.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.140
- You like Pinkberry?
- I'm lactose intolerant.

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.340
- Right.
- You got an African-American belly?

00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.780
- Because black people suffer from lactose.
- Oh, okay, good, well...

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.300
- We got some kind of kinship.
- Yeah, cool, man.

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.140
- Stool soft?
- It can be.

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:39.980
- Bottom tender.
- Yeah, bottom's fine.

00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:43.220
If somebody took my Pinkberry,
I wouldn't take that sitting down.

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.260
- You would fight.
- I will cut a motherfucker in half.

00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.140
You wouldn't kidnap someone
because you can't successfully pull it off.

00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.340
Name me a kidnapping movie...

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.580
where the kidnappers weren't dead
or incarcerated at the end.

00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.260
- 9 to 5, asshole.
- 9 to 5.

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.100
- Name me two movies, then.
- You said name one.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:03.260
- I nailed one right on you.
- 9 to 5 was this movie...

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:07.100
I know what the fuck 9 to 5 is. It's about
the white bitch with the big titties.

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:09.380
- Yeah.
- She got old, the titties stayed young.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:11.700
I'm not gonna kidnap someone
based on 9 to 5.

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.620
- That's because you Jane Fonda.
- You're the scaredy-cat one.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.580
You're always the last to man up.
You're dragging your feet.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.340
Why are you here
if you're not gonna participate?

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.500
First of all, if anyone,
I'm the smart one. I'm Lily Tomlin.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:27.220
- But I won't have this conversation.
- Please, I'm Lily Tomlin, if anybody is.

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.020
Sitting in the big chair,
giving David O. Russell shit.

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.180
- Yeah, he's got the 'tude. You're Fonda, man.
- You're Jane Fonda.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.380
- That makes you Dolly Parton.
- Great. Woman's got her own theme park.

00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.940
- She's a national treasure.
- Two national treasures.

00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:42.461
Can I pose a question to you colonizers?

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:44.751
Happened a long time ago.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.189
How do you kidnap somebody
without them knowing...

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.184
they've been kidnapped?

00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.820
- Okay.
- You smarten up, and you don't even do it.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.830
- He's a black sphinx. I like it.
- He threw a riddle our way.

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.420
- How do you...?
- Voodoo. Voodoo?

00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.543
I can give you the answers.

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:04.860
- Fifty thousand.
- No.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.505
- We can't.
- Six hundred?

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.740
You should not run a Pinkberry. Sorry.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.420
- The weirdest negotiating style.
- We don't have money.

00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:15.261
You know, we're here because
we have zero dollars. We're broke.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:16.780
Fuck it. Give me the watch.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.260
- Nope.
- Give him your watch.

00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.260
- I'm not giving him this. This is a Tag Heuer.
- This is a wrist without a watch.

00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.260
Come on. It's just material things.
Can't take it with you.

00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.940
You can borrow it
while you tell us a shitty plan.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.461
All right.

00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.580
Slip him a mickey.

00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:37.740
Give me the watch back.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.460
You sneak into his crib at night.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:42.660
Find out whatever his beverage
of choice is before he goes to bed.

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.340
You slip the mickey in the beverage.
Knock him out nice and easy.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.580
And you keep that bitch sedated
until Daddy pays up.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.380
It's not a crazy idea,
but it's not worth a Swiss watch.

00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.380
- That could work.
- That's great. That makes total sense.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:58.900
- He doesn't see our faces.
- We're ghosts. We don't even exist.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.900
- When you say "mickey... "?
- A date-rape drug. Where do you get those?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.260
- Where do I get them?
- Yeah.

00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.620
Because of the hue of my skin
I know where to get date-rape drugs?

00:31:08.720 --> 00:31:11.820
- You brought up the date-raping.
- You got N word in your eyes.

00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:14.340
- Why are your eyes saying the N word?
- Klan eyes.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.820
- You've got Klan eyes.
- You ever take a eye test?

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:18.660
- Yes.
- All you pick out is the K.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.660
- I see every letter.
- He does have Klan eyes.

00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.980
You can see them poking out
behind that sheet.

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.980
- It's just ridic... I can't... It's so upsetting.
- Let me ask you a question.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:30.740
When you got raped by Julia, what did she
use to knock you out? Laughing gas?

00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:32.100
- Oh, right.
- That'll work.

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:34.540
- That's interesting.
- You have keys to the office?

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:36.230
- No, but I know the code.
- Yes.

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:38.420
Okay. You did it again.

00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:41.340
- For the record, I am not racist.
- You're the best. Thank you very much.

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.260
- Let's go. See you.
- Good to see you.

00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:46.340
Surprisingly helpful.
Any way I can get the watch back?

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.861
Fuck out of here, Jane Fonda.

00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:56.740
That's a tough one.
And you can't fuck all three, right?

00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:58.740
- You cannot.
- Not the game. Okay.

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.740
Well, then I would marry Peter,
kill Bobby, and fuck Greg.

00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.340
- That's what I'd do too.
- Yeah?

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.260
- I think that's the only way to play it.
- It makes sense.

00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.980
- How'd you do?
- I did great.

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:12.260
I got extra supplies. I think we
gotta be more careful this time.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.460
- Absolutely. So smart.
- I got a magazine to cut up the ransom note.

00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.340
- Can't be writing it by hand.
- Smart.

00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:18.580
Bride Again Magazine?

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.780
To throw the cops off if they start snooping
to figure out where the letters came from.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.060
- Dora the Explorer walkie-talkies?
- Awesome.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:29.180
- It's not a spy store. It's a convenience store.
- Didn't wanna just use our phones?

00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:33.060
Let's use our phones. They make a record
of everything that we say and do.

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.220
- Do you watch the news?
- My apologies.

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.540
Hey, Obama.
I'm breaking into my old office.

00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:40.300
It's just the three of us doing this,
not us and the NSA.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.100
I'm trying to help us out.

00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:44.260
- Did you get scissors?
- I got some scissors.

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.020
- I don't see any latex gloves in here.
- They're, like, super expensive.

00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.540
- How much?
- Nine bucks a pair.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:50.940
- That's ridiculous.
- Right?

00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:55.180
- It's the only thing you went in there to buy.
- She's got a ton of gloves in her office.

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:56.380
We'll just use those.

00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.300
You need them to get inside,
so we don't leave fingerprints.

00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.780
That's right. You dummy.
Don't you know that?

00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.700
Know what we can do?
We can use my golf gloves in my bag.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.420
He's got gloves in his golf bag.

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.180
Don't poke holes in everything.
I'm trying to help out.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.340
Guys, the team's back together.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.660
I call lookout.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.261
And I will let you know if I see Swiper.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.942
Nice. Let's go.

00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:27.980
How we doing in there, guys?

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.500
I got it. I got it. I got it.

00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:31.660
All good. How are things
out there, Nick?

00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:35.546
Things are good. Hey, can you not say
my name over the radio, please?

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.064
- Why not?
- Could be somebody on the frequency.

00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:41.220
Oh, yeah. It's a good point. Very smart.

00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.740
There you go.
That's using the old Hendricks brain.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.660
And there's the last name.

00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:48.260
- We should come up with code names.
- Absolutely.

00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.620
- Nick, where you landing on code names?
- I'd love it if you'd stop saying my name.

00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.187
- Just get the gas and get out here.
- Roger that.

00:33:57.400 --> 00:33:59.540
The Blade has acquired the target.

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:02.346
- Was that "The Blade"?
- That's my code name, Nick.

00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.420
We don't need code names.
Everybody knows who's talking.

00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.500
They're sounding pretty cool,
so let's try to land on a couple.

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:11.385
I'm gonna think up one real quick
and lay it on you.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:16.340
I'm coming in at you with The Majestic Lion.
I'm gonna be The Majestic Lion.

00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.620
Now we're talking.

00:34:17.720 --> 00:34:19.740
Not gonna call you that.

00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.860
That's a bummer there.
I'm gonna need a reason as to why.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:26.020
Because you're not a jungle cat,
and it's stupid as shit.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:27.460
- Fair point.
- Good catch.

00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.300
We should come up with one for him.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.740
- How about St. Nick?
- You've said my name four fucking times.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.340
If you could come back out
to the car, we can go home.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.340
You know what?
What if I drop the "Lion"?

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.540
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:41.020
- Somebody's here. Somebody's here.
- Just The Majestic?

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.060
I love that. I like that.

00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:48.426
Shut up about the code names. A bunch
of people just pulled up into the parking lot.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.625
Hello. Get your thumb off the butt...

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:58.389
Oh, my God.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:04.551
Real hot chick just pulled
into Julia's parking spot.

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.460
I think Julia's headed
into the building.

00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.460
If you'd get your thumb
off the fucking button and...

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.940
Fuck. Fucking idiots.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:16.780
Well, you know what? It's not my fault.
It's not my goddamn fault.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:19.740
I haven't done a thing illegal.
I can just drive out of here.

00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:22.386
I can just drive right home.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:25.740
No, I can't do that. I can't do that.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.180
They'll just fucking tell on me.

00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:32.020
All right, we're on our way to you.
Chickens have left the pot. My God, my God.

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.380
- The coop, I think.
- What?

00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.620
The "my God, my God"
does sounds like a thing.

00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.504
Oh, shit.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.506
Why don't you set the food up over there?
And we'll circle these chairs around.

00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.790
Dale?

00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.424
Kurt.

00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:09.620
God, grant us...

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.820
Oh, shit. It's a cult.
It's a fucking cult.

00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.340
...about our sex addiction
that we cannot change...

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.820
- Sex addiction.
- It's a sex addiction. Yeah.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.021
Neat.

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:25.180
So proud of you, every one of you,
for being here today.

00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:26.711
Shit.

00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.660
How's it going?

00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.261
Hi. It's going...

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.381
You know.

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.067
I'm in trouble.

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.301
- Save it.
- Okay.

00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:52.540
...something that happened
to them this week.

00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:57.100
Found this gentleman
loitering out in your hall.

00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.900
Oh, shit. Nick got busted.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.182
Says he knows he's in trouble.

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.220
- Yeah.
- We're all in trouble.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:07.780
You don't have to be afraid.
You're safe here.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.220
Okay.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.540
Sorry I'm late. What's up, brother?

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:16.580
Toby, why don't you grab a chair and bring
it in so this young man can join us?

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:18.748
Yeah...

00:37:19.560 --> 00:37:21.947
- Boy...
- What's your name, honey?

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:25.267
I am...

00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:31.304
I am Blanston.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.380
- Hi, Blanston.
- Hi.

00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.980
For a guy not into code names...

00:37:36.080 --> 00:37:37.300
- Big swing.
- Bold choice.

00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.540
- And I love it.
- Yeah.

00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:43.268
- It's nice to have fresh blood in the group.
- Appreciate it.

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:45.460
- Fresh, cute blood.
- Hey.

00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:50.300
Easy, Julia. Blanston, would you like to
share with us what's led you into recovery?

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:56.269
Well, okay.
I do have a very big problem.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.980
Just been hitting it hard.
I've been hitting it hard.

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.420
He thinks he's in an AA meeting.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:04.740
Getting together with the guys.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.820
Oftentimes, ending up just face down.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.180
Chugging one after the other.
Sometimes double-fisted, just:

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:15.020
You know?
You know what I'm talking about.

00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:18.420
So your sexual addiction,
it's homosexual in nature?

00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:22.060
My sex addiction? My sex addiction is...

00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:23.460
And then what did you say?

00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:28.020
- You like to fuck guys.
- No. My sex addiction is to ladies.

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:29.860
- Oh.
- You know. I'm addicted to women.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:31.107
Boring.

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.820
- Oh, fuck, I have to piss.
- What?

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:36.220
I have to piss. I'm nervous. I'm sorry.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.700
- Go, go, just pee.
- It's gonna make too much noise.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.580
No, no, just dip your dick
into the toilet.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:44.140
- Oh, sit down and do it? Okay.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:47.060
- It doesn't reach.
- What?

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.380
It doesn't reach. Should it reach?

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.180
I mean, I don't know if it's
about "should," but...

00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.540
- I'll put the seat up.
- Yeah, put the seat up...

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.620
- ...and just dip your butt in the bowl.
- Oh, my God.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.420
There we go.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.540
- Oh, shit, sorry.
- It's okay.

00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:05.540
- Sorry, I always flush.
- It's all right.

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.260
Okay, I'm just gonna wash my hands.

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.260
No. Why are you gonna wash your hands?

00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.700
- Why?
- I always wash my hands.

00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:13.020
- You have gloves on.
- Stuff gets under there.

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.860
- Fine, just be quiet. Okay, okay.
- Let me just wash them. I'll feel better.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:22.140
Oh, my God, Dale, stop.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.180
There's literally no element of sneak
in anything you're doing.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:27.180
- It's gross not to.
- I gotta go now too.

00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.462
- You gotta go?
- Yeah.

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.740
Do you golf with the other hand...?

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:40.580
- Don't whistle.
- I have to. The only way to get this train going.

00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:50.260
- Listen...
- Why did you flush?

00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:51.420
- It just happens.
- Why?

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.900
- It's a good habit.
- Shit.

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:04.860
- What is...?
- Shit. She's coming. Hide.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.380
But there was once, though.
There was once...

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:12.740
Oh, boy. If this is safe in here,
I'd love to shake this out and share it.

00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:14.940
Something must've happened.
Don't fall on me.

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.900
Don't worry. I took a parkour class
at the community center.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.780
Oh, he got her to go back.

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:22.540
- I was a boy.
- How old were you?

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:24.340
- I don't know. Young.
- Fourteen?

00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:27.500
I think we were.
Two 14-year-old boys at camp...

00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.460
and not knowing what we're doing...

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:33.460
and just wrestling.

00:40:33.560 --> 00:40:36.709
Ooh. Wrestling camp. Fourteen.

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:38.306
Nice.

00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.420
- Is he telling the truth?
- I... I don't know. But, I mean, if he is...

00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.260
- Good for him, right?
- Absolutely. That's great.

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.580
- Did you guys wear those tight little onesies?
- Singlets?

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.340
- Is that what they're called?
- That's right. Singlets.

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.860
Tight little spandex offering a clear little
outline of, say, a circumcised helmet?

00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:57.740
- Oh, boy.
- Am I getting warm?

00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.100
Okay, maybe someone else should share.

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.340
- No, no, no. Let's go to the unit.
- Sorry?

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:06.380
What was the unit like on this little b...?
Was it veiny? Smooth?

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.940
Little turtleneck? Anteater?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.260
I just... I don't know. Pretty normal.

00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:14.500
- Starter penis?
- Not the words I would've used, but...

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:17.580
It's good to have a gay friend
in your group too, you know?

00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.509
- It makes us more colorful.
- Yeah.

00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:23.660
Now, did this penis ever, at any point,
find its way into your mouth?

00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.180
- Jesus.
- Julia, no.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.980
- You're not gonna pull this stunt again.
- What stunt?

00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:31.220
Stopping a meeting early
so she can try to flip another gay.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.740
- Really?
- She always wants what she can't have.

00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.900
Listen, relax, okay? He's not even gay.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.060
He had one cock at 14 and it hasn't
made its way to his mouth yet.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.380
- Well, if you'd let me finish...
- So you did eat that cock.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.780
- You're asking if I sucked it?
- I know you sucked it.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.420
I just wanna hear you say it.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.060
- Blanston, you don't have to say it.
- Shut your mouth.

00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:51.780
- Shut up and let him share. You ate it?
- Please say yes.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.580
You wanna know if I ate that dick?

00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:56.580
Did you suck that cock like a Bomb Pop
down to the blue?

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.580
- You want the answer?
- Give it to me.

00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.660
I ate that dick, balls,
and licked that kid's sweaty asshole.

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.540
Damn right you did
because you are awesomely gay.

00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:07.740
I'm super gay. Never been straight.
Know what else I've never been?

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.580
- Inside a woman.
- Meeting adjourned.

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:11.260
- Everybody out.
- Son of a bitch.

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:13.940
Come on. Hurry it up.
Hurry it up. Come on.

00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:18.060
- See you later. Bye-bye. That's it.
- Okay, Julia, you are letting the addiction win.

00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.140
Oh, fuck you, Roz.
No one likes you anyway.

00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:22.380
Okay.

00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.940
- Let's get you prepped for a fill-n-drill.
- Let's do it.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:28.940
- Ever done it in a dentist's chair?
- I always wanted to nail my dentist.

00:42:29.040 --> 00:42:31.940
- He's a man.
- I'll make you forget all about him.

00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:36.140
Why don't you go get the chair ready?
I'm gonna visit the men's room real quick.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.620
Oh, you can do that on me.

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.790
Oh. Well, it's a...

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.780
And...?

00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:46.951
Well, first time on the slopes,
so I'm gonna stay off the black diamond.

00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.991
Either way.

00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:54.340
- You guys are so noisy. Let's go.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.660
Congrats. I'm so proud of you
for coming out.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.180
- I'm not gay. I'll be right out, okay?
- Come on.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:03.300
I think it'll be a little suspicious if I disappear.
Gonna complete the diversion.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.100
- We gotta go.
- Thought you were gay.

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:07.428
I'm not gay. Go on, go on.
I'll be right out.

00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:09.980
Oh. I get it. You're bi.

00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:11.540
I'm not bi.

00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:12.980
Not bi?

00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:16.982
- Do you have, an S? I need an S.
- S, yes.

00:43:17.280 --> 00:43:19.820
- How's that?
- Do you have a scarier S than that?

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.500
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, here.
This is from an article about bridezillas.

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:27.060
Yeah, that'll do it. Okay, can I read
you what I got right now?

00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.300
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:31.300
"Give us the $500,000..

00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:32.980
...or the little boy dies.

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:37.742
You have 24 hours."

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.820
I wish you were there to read it.
Sounds scary in that voice.

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.580
That's why I wanted scary letters.

00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:45.300
Hopefully he's hearing a voice
like that when he reads.

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:49.660
- But why "little boy"? Makes him sound 6.
- Don't wanna be like, "Or the grown man dies."

00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.180
- You're right. No, absolutely.
- It's not even...

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.540
- All right, glue stick, and I'm gonna lock this in.
- Oh, great, yeah.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:58.460
- First draft, final draft, right?
- How about that? Nice job.

00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:00.060
God, I tell you what.

00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:04.500
I hope this doesn't sound cocky.
I think we're really good at this.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:05.900
We're extremely good at it.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.866
I didn't wanna say anything,
but way better than murder.

00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.180
- A lot better than murder.
- We found our groove.

00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:12.580
- This is fun.
- It is kind of fun.

00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.300
- Nobody gets hurt.
- I always wanted to make a ransom note.

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.340
All here. Let's go.

00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.700
Son of a bitch. I knew I should've been
gluing them as I went along.

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.020
Oy, oy, oy.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.980
Hey. Hey. Talk to me. How was it?

00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:28.460
It was like something
I've just never encountered.

00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.660
What, a woman?

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.260
I mean, she's so free.
She's so eloquent with her body.

00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:37.060
I mean, all of that sexual energy...

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.980
it flows from this place
of deep tenderness, you know?

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.060
- It's called her vagina, Nick.
- Please don't talk like that. Come on, let's go.

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.740
Listen. He's being so protective.

00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:50.865
You're talking like you fell in love with her.
What, are you in love with her, Nick?

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.100
No, Dale.

00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.540
- That was a real long pause right there.
- That was a moment of silence.

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.420
I'm not in love with her.
That's ridiculous.

00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.900
She gave me a very rich
and positive experience.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.262
Oh, yeah? Better than wrestling camp?

00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:16.020
Oh, boy. Nice house.

00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.540
Well, he's doing well.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:19.820
Good for him.

00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:22.580
- All right, let's discuss our options.
- Breathe, and go.

00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:26.620
Hey, whoa. Guys, you can't just park
right in front of the guy's house.

00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.220
You wanna carry an unconscious dude
down the street?

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:31.220
He's gonna be way too heavy. Let's move.

00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.990
That's a good point. Good point.

00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.020
Wait, whoa. You can't just walk up
to the guy's front door.

00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:40.180
- Will you calm down? We have a plan.
- We have a plan. Just relax.

00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.101
Oh, do you? That's great.
That makes me feel a lot better.

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.420
- Okay, you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:48.384
Watch this. Go.

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.180
- Fuck.
- Fuck.

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:51.950
- It's a bust.
- It's locked.

00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:57.310
- The plan did not account for a locked door?
- Fifty-fifty chance it's gonna be open.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.500
- How do you figure that?
- Either locked or unlocked.

00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.740
- Fifty-fifty, yeah.
- It's basic math. What's up with you tonight?

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.580
- Give me your credit card.
- Good.

00:46:05.680 --> 00:46:07.740
- Plan B's got a credit card in it?
- Come on.

00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:09.540
- Your plan sucks.
- Your math sucks.

00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:10.780
That's what's going on.

00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:12.980
- Wait. What if he's in there?
- Oh, yeah.

00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.620
- How do we make sure?
- Why don't you ring the doorbell?

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:17.420
- I love it. Smart.
- Don't. Kurt.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.620
Oh, shit. Are you kidding?

00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.740
- It's dark. Don't think anybody's here.
- Don't hit it again.

00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.620
- You hear that?
- I know that song.

00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:29.620
- What is that?
- It's a song, right? Is it:

00:46:29.720 --> 00:46:31.380
No matter what you do

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.740
No, no.

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.100
I will always be with you

00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:35.620
- Who sings that?
- Badfinger.

00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:37.300
Doesn't matter what you do, girl

00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:38.580
Quiet.

00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:40.900
Ooh, girl, with you

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.260
You nailed it.

00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:43.620
Knock down the old gray wall

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:45.060
Shut the fuck up.

00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:47.180
- Hey, you're yelling.
- You're yelling.

00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:48.780
Do me a favor. Hurry up.

00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:52.507
Fail to open up the front door
so we can get the fuck out of here.

00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.660
Fuck.

00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.260
- What's "fuck"? What happened?
- We got a problem.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:46:59.500
- Yeah, see? Right there?
- Goddamn it.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.020
- There it is. Staring back at us.
- Okay, what now?

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:04.620
I guess we follow your idea
and we get out of here.

00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:07.340
- Yeah, we gotta go.
- No. Hey. My credit card's in there.

00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.780
- Call them and cancel.
- They'll send you a new one overnight.

00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:14.223
When they find the card, they'll know
we were here. It's pretty simple.

00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:16.542
- Oh, shit.
- They're gonna know you were here.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.068
Go, go. Car. Car.

00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.909
- What do you got going there?
- Finger-flage.

00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:34.660
Is that his wife?

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:37.340
No, that's a '93 Civic
and she's carrying dry cleaning.

00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:38.660
I'm gonna go with a maid.

00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:41.261
He married his maid?

00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:51.591
Mr. Rex, are you home?

00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.382
It me, Kim Song.

00:47:54.520 --> 00:47:57.829
I pick up your dry cleaning.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:11.190
- Okay, I got it.
- Wow.

00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:13.071
He's got good taste.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.580
It's bent, goddamn it.

00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:17.700
- Nice, clean lines, little pops of color.
- Let's go.

00:48:17.800 --> 00:48:18.860
- Go?
- What?

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.660
We just got inside. Let's stay.

00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:24.060
- So did she. Let's get the fuck out of here.
- Are you quitting on the plan?

00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.540
- Back in. Back in. He's here.
- Why? Who's here?

00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:31.500
- Mr. Rex.
- Oh, shit.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.586
Kim? You here?

00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.420
Kim, you grab my shirts?

00:48:40.520 --> 00:48:43.226
- Yes, Mr. Rex. I go hang up now.
- Great.

00:48:43.480 --> 00:48:45.309
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Kim. Kimbo.

00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:48.980
Take a look at this.
Tell me what you see.

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.990
Are you gonna leave this mess
in the bottom of my sink?

00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:53.900
The water?

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.460
Yes, the little water droplets
all over the bottom of my sink.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.820
I don't know what thatched hut
you grew up in, but this is disgusting.

00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.820
But it just water.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:05.340
Okay. Okay.

00:49:05.440 --> 00:49:07.304
Then you just fire.

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:11.220
You lose your job. Too bad for you.

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.468
Bye-bye.

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:19.227
Look at you. I got you again.

00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:21.700
Look at that little chubby face.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:24.660
You think I was gonna fire you
on your fucking birthday?

00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.864
Are you out of your mind, Mrs. Miyagi?
Get over here.

00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:30.220
Come here, you. Happy birthday.

00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.706
I got you something.

00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:40.620
That's a good one.

00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.744
That's top of the line.
That's like the Cadillac of plungers.

00:49:44.280 --> 00:49:45.980
That's just for here, though, okay?

00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.620
- No taking it home.
- No.

00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:49.740
Yeah, what's up, man?

00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:55.026
Yeah, no, I'm not busy at all. I'm just
making my maid's day. It's her birthday.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.100
Hey, Kim, seriously, though.
Can we keep a dry sink from here on in?

00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.586
Yes, Mr. Rex.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:02.660
What's up?

00:50:02.760 --> 00:50:04.300
No, fuck that, man.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.104
Kim.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.349
Dude, I'm trying. My dad is being
a total dick about the money.

00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.867
What's she doing?

00:50:57.600 --> 00:51:00.060
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- What is she doing?

00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.380
- Kurt. Kurt. Kurt.
- What? What? What?

00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:04.860
Oh, shit. That's my thing.
She's doing my thing.

00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:08.542
- I can't believe she's fucking doing that.
- She's not going in deep enough.

00:51:09.200 --> 00:51:11.507
- Do you think she's just cleaning?
- What a rookie.

00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:14.107
Okay, there she goes. Okay. All right.

00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:17.028
Kimchi.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.750
- There he is.
- Okay.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.180
- Oh, no. He's gonna brush his teeth.
- He is.

00:51:24.280 --> 00:51:26.060
- He's gonna do it.
- Here he goes.

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.820
- Do it.
- Do it.

00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.421
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:34.500
Yeah, get them nice and clean,
you son of a bitch.

00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:35.900
So satisfying.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.860
Wait, guys. Okay. Now what, though?
What are we doing? What do we do now?

00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:42.980
We wait for him to go to bed. Dale starts
the gas. I've got the ransom note.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:46.020
- Not now.
- He said, "Dale, start the gas."

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:47.340
I said, "Dale starts the gas."

00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:50.340
Later, you idiot. Turn that off.
We can't have the gas in here.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.820
Okay. I'll put this on the...

00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.580
- Turn it off.
- I'm trying to. It's broken or something.

00:51:54.680 --> 00:51:56.780
Are you kidding me?
Turn it the other way.

00:51:56.880 --> 00:52:00.180
We dropped it like a million times.
I think we broke it. No, see?

00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:02.220
- It's not doing anything.
- Let's get out.

00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:04.100
What? He's right outside.

00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.340
Shit. He's right there.
Then get the can out of here.

00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:09.580
Don't start laughing.
What is funny about this?

00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:11.460
Look at your face. Look at his face.

00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.860
- Oh, no.
- Dude, your face...

00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.060
The gas. Is this the gas?

00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.660
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.980
Hey. Listen. Keep it together.

00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.220
Yes, it's the gas.

00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.828
- It's pretty good.
- You keep it together.

00:52:27.520 --> 00:52:29.304
I was trying to hit him.

00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:32.980
- Guys.
- No, no, no.

00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:35.831
Okay. I'm good. I'm good. Let's...

00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:52.980
Shit. Kurt. Kurt, your phone.

00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.540
Your phone. Answer your phone.

00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:56.860
- I got it. I got it. I got it.
- Where are we?

00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:59.660
- Shut it off.
- Why is your wife calling me?

00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.740
Oh, shit. Oh, shit. She's probably freaking out.
I didn't come home last night.

00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:04.940
Quiet.

00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.427
Dude, get your fucking head
out of my crotch.

00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:16.860
Will you look at this fucking view
during the daytime? You kidding me?

00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.420
- He seems gone.
- Unbelievable.

00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:20.420
- Bed's made.
- I can't believe this.

00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:21.860
We should maybe just check.

00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:23.220
- Hey! Rex!
- Hey.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.820
Rex! Rex!

00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.749
Dale.

00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:30.587
Did you have a plan if he responded?

00:53:31.360 --> 00:53:35.060
- I didn't think that far ahead.
- You get even dumber in the mornings.

00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:36.700
- Why are you worried?
- Let's go.

00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.471
- You know, fifty-fifty chance he was here.
- Yeah.

00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:43.020
You know, Stacy's just gonna
completely flip out when I get home.

00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.740
- What kind of dad doesn't come home?
- Shut that down.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:49.700
If the worst thing that happens from this
clusterfuck is your domestic problems...

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:53.380
we can consider ourselves lucky.
We just dodged a huge bullet back there.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:56.060
We almost made
the worst decision of our lives.

00:53:56.160 --> 00:54:00.540
That's true. Know why? If he opens that
closet and sees us, we're in prison right now.

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:05.060
That's right. So we're very, very lucky.
What the fuck is the matter with us?

00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.140
I tell you what. If a couple tiny things
went our way, we could've pulled that off.

00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.500
We're not criminals. We suck at crime.
We're nice, normal guys.

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.260
- I like baseball. I wear pants.
- Yup.

00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.940
- Back to being cogs in the machine.
- Cogs. Cogs, dude.

00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.266
Cogs are good.

00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.900
It's a relief, you know?

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.060
It's like a weight lifted off your...
What is it, shoulders?

00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:27.423
- It's a fresh start where everything's...
- I'll call you guys later.

00:54:27.720 --> 00:54:29.660
- Please don't kill me.
- Fuck!

00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.620
- Oh, fuck.
- What the fuck is that?

00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:36.140
What the fuck is that? What did we do?
We kidnap him while we're high on nitrous?

00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:38.540
Then went back into the closet
and went to sleep?

00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.460
- Why would we do that?
- What?

00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.505
Is he crying?

00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:50.829
Oh, my God. The best.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.304
That was so good.

00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:55.980
Help me out.

00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.620
The look on your... Look at this.

00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.307
I really couldn't... Your fucking face.

00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.380
- Oh, my God.
- Hey, man. Yeah. Whoo-whee.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.140
You had us.

00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:17.911
Oh! Oh!

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.940
- What's happening?
- I don't know.

00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.268
- What's happening?
- Oh, boy.

00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:29.869
Oh, my God, you guys. Thank you.

00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:34.300
I have not laughed
like that in a long time.

00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.060
Oh, my God. Goddamn, that was great.
Food for the soul.

00:55:37.160 --> 00:55:39.260
Good, well, we were
just trying to be funny.

00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:41.940
- You know, no harm, no foul, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:43.900
Guys, I completely underestimated you.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.741
You fuckers have some low-hanging balls.
I mean it. I'm impressed.

00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.700
I mean, I wake up,
I find you three in my closet...

00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.540
along with a ransom note,
a big old bottle of nitrous.

00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:57.180
I'm like, "Holy shit.
These fuckers were gonna gas me."

00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:59.940
I'm about to call the cops when I think,
"Hold up a sec.

00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:02.108
These guys may be onto something."

00:56:03.160 --> 00:56:05.220
I wanna partner up on this thing.

00:56:05.320 --> 00:56:08.580
- What thing? What are you talking about?
- I'm not sure what you mean.

00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:11.101
- This thing. My kidnapping.
- Oh.

00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.264
Truth be told, Pop and I...

00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:17.980
we've hit a rough patch.
He's refusing to cover some of my expenses.

00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:22.220
Long story. Anyway, your timing could not
have been better. Is this a fucking marlin?

00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.740
Rex, this is, cool and all,
but we decided, like, we're out.

00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.700
- We're not doing crime.
- Not our thing.

00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.820
Yeah, no, he's right.
No, the kidnapping is off, actually.

00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:33.180
- No, no, no, it's on.
- No, it's off.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:35.820
No, it's totally on.
I sent the ransom note to my dad.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.340
- You what?
- You did what?

00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:40.862
It's brilliant. Who came up with
that thing about me being a little boy?

00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.180
- Beautiful.
- Thanks.

00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:47.101
I was a little insulted you only asked for
$500,000 for me. Is that all I'm worth?

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:50.061
No sweat. I tacked on another zero.

00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.390
- Five-hundred million?
- Wow, that's a ton.

00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:55.340
- Five million, guys.
- Five million.

00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.020
- Five million.
- Five. Right.

00:56:57.120 --> 00:57:01.340
Yeah, 5 million. One million dollars
for you guys, and 4 for me.

00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.144
Why don't we make that ransom call?

00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:04.980
Yeah, Rex, let's not.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:10.300
We appreciate the offer, and thank you for
not calling the cops, but we're gonna pass.

00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:11.500
- No.
- Yeah.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.420
Guys. Guys, how's this anything
but great news?

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.700
All I'm asking you to do is finish your
own plan but for double the money.

00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:22.060
Plus, it got a thousand times easier
because now I'm your inside man.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:23.700
I can make sure Dad pays up.

00:57:23.800 --> 00:57:25.540
And then when you, "set me free"...

00:57:25.640 --> 00:57:28.660
I tell the cops it was three
other morons that went that way.

00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:31.300
Oh. Wow. That's not the
worst idea I've ever heard.

00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:33.820
- It's better than our original idea.
- A lot better.

00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.460
Give us one second.

00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.700
Fucking what?

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:39.380
- We can't trust this guy.
- You can trust me.

00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:43.220
No, you're right. They burned us once already.
We're not gonna get burned again.

00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:45.580
- Nice try.
- Thanks but no thanks.

00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.860
- That's a Nick-Kurt-Dale no from us.
- Nick, Kurt and Dale.

00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.980
- So, thank you, but adios.
- Yeah.

00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:53.700
- Okay.
- You need a ride?

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.980
No. I think I'll hang out here.

00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.580
You know, escape from your clutches...

00:57:58.680 --> 00:58:00.380
and call the police.

00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.740
Go ahead. Call them.
We never kidnapped you.

00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.380
- Yeah, you did.
- We didn't.

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.340
- Yeah, you abducted me.
- We did not.

00:58:06.440 --> 00:58:08.180
Yeah, you brought me back here.

00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:11.260
- There was a struggle.
- Oh, shit. Come on, man.

00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.110
Things got broken.

00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.747
What the...?

00:58:15.440 --> 00:58:17.420
And then, you assaulted me.

00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.100
- Oh, shit.
- What?

00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.700
This guy's fucking nuts.

00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:22.620
Hey, Rex? It's off, pal.

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.220
Oh, and then you beat me. Mercilessly.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.940
Holy shit. He's Fight Clubbing himself.
We got a Fight Clubber.

00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.064
And then I found my way up here
and I found this phone.

00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:36.580
- I picked up the receiver...
- Oh, no.

00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.100
...and I dialed 9...

00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:40.460
- Don't, don't, don't.
- Come on. Joke's over.

00:58:40.560 --> 00:58:42.620
- ...1...
- Don't you hit the second 1.

00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:44.151
- Don't do it.
- Don't hit it.

00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:49.980
I don't know where I'm going.
I don't know where you find pay phones.

00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.420
- There's some pay phones at the park here.
- Okay.

00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:56.670
Boys, we are doing this.
The adventure begins. Who's fired up?

00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:02.220
Such a negative energy.
This is killing me. Guys, come on.

00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:06.220
- Can you scoot over just a smidge?
- No, I sit in the middle.

00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:08.380
- That's his seat.
- It's a whole thing, Rex.

00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.340
- I know. Just you're crowding me.
- I'm crowding this guy now?

00:59:11.440 --> 00:59:13.500
He's forcing us to kidnap him,
and I'm crowding him?

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:17.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy. Simmer down.
Kidnapping was your idea, remember?

00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.420
- But then we had the idea to not do it.
- Yeah, exactly.

00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:22.300
- I sit in the middle!
- Hey, hey.

00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.026
- Dale, just do what he says.
- For chrissake.

00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:27.791
Oh, God. That is nice.

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:29.865
This is way better.

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.063
This is bullshit, by the way.

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:43.580
Excuse me, Dr. Harris.
Was someone in the office last night?

00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:46.620
My sex-addiction group met here at 8.

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.700
Oh. Yes. But, doctor,
the keypad logged an earlier entrance.

00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:52.231
Really?

00:59:52.480 --> 00:59:54.389
Let's check our fancy new camera system.

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.740
That's a gay guy. It's so weird.
He didn't bone me like a gay guy.

01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:03.540
He only cried, like, a little bit.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.980
And he was oddly squeamish
about his own asshole, which is weird.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:09.911
- It's so weird.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.580
Is that Dale?

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:15.380
What's he doing with Kurt and Blanston?

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.389
- Should we call the police?
- No.

01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:18.946
No.

01:00:19.360 --> 01:00:20.950
I'll take care of them.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:23.351
Enjoy.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.550
It's good stuff. Learn something.

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:34.420
All right, it's ringing.

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:39.060
Remember, you guys hold all the cards.
Game faces. You are going to crush this.

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:42.184
Hold on. He knows what we sound like.
We gotta use an accent.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:45.385
- No accents. That's ridiculous.
- That's a great idea, Kurty.

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:46.900
Boulder Stream.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.300
- Who is this? The secretary?
- Accent. Yeah.

01:00:49.400 --> 01:00:52.788
Hey, homey. Let me speak
to Mr. Bert Hanson.

01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:56.540
No, I don't mind holding. I just barely
even called you right now already.

01:00:56.640 --> 01:00:58.740
- That's incredibly racist.
- Super racist.

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.100
Just do a Southern accent.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.620
Southern? Southern I got.
Southern. No problem.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.260
Hanson.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:08.580
Well, howdy there, partner.

01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:11.700
This here's the gents
what got your young'un and all.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:14.460
And, well, we got some
talking to do and...

01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:17.500
- Southern, not old prospector.
- I thought that was pretty good.

01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:22.380
Listen, you lowlife bottom-feeder, I don't
have time for this little fuck-around.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:25.740
Either this ends right now,
or it ends with bullets in your skulls.

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:29.300
Now, you hush. You don't scare us
one bit. We got your boy.

01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:33.983
- I bet that tears you up something fierce.
- How do I know you really have my boy?

01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:36.667
Dad.

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:39.980
Dad, is that you? Please. They're crazy.

01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:42.500
They told me if you call the police,
they'd kill me.

01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:45.620
Please. Please, do whatever they say.
I don't wanna die, Dad.

01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:47.580
No police.

01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:50.020
- God!
- Rex? Rex? Where are you?

01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.980
Now, you listen.
Y'all gonna have to rassle up...

01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.060
that 5 million bucks in cash.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:57.780
We're looking at all 100s.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.980
- Unmarked.
- Unmarked.

01:01:59.080 --> 01:02:01.980
- No tracers.
- No tracers and no dye packs neither.

01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.660
Otherwise, we gonna take your boy...

01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.300
and string him up by
his pretty little neck...

01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:12.940
with the roughest,
coarsest piece of rope we got...

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.420
in our rope inventory.

01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:18.544
You understand?
You got 24 hours before he dead.

01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.300
- Yes.
- That is how it's done.

01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.581
Let's go. All right.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.546
Guys, that was great.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:27.180
That was so much fun.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.020
- Absolutely.
- You were incredible.

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.820
- Thanks for getting us snacks, dude.
- You earned it.

01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.300
So now what? What do we do?

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.540
- Okay.
- What's the plan?

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.900
I say we go back to the office.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.620
Okay? Lay low for a little while.

01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:40.740
And we wait for that
money train to roll in.

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:43.780
- Choo-choo!
- Choo-choo, baby!

01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:48.300
- Oh! Turn up this song. I love this one.
- We're doing this thing.

01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:52.540
I hate to break up the car party, but, Rex,
you don't have a plan for the ransom drop...

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.540
and that is the part
where people get caught.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:59.180
Wow. The ransom drop is only hard
if the police are involved.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.300
Yeah. But what if he does call the police?
Because that wouldn't be good.

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.300
He's a billionaire. He's not gonna
risk my life over $5 million.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:10.940
After Kurt's little performance,
there's no way he's gonna call the cops.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.900
My performance? What about yours?
You were so in the moment.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.140
- You think so?
- You were great! And you were!

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.500
Get your mouths off his dick, okay?

01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.060
- Everyone was doing pretty good.
- Whoa. Take it down a notch.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:24.260
Wait. Shut up, shut up, shut up.
This is Stacy.

01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:26.580
Oh, my God. I forgot to call her.
Hi, honey.

01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.500
- Where have you been all night?
- Here's what happened.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.460
I fell asleep at the office, and...

01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.660
Really? Because Find My iPhone
said you weren't at the office.

01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:36.740
What, are you cheating on me, Dale?

01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:38.580
- Look, you're upset and...
- Oh, shit.

01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:41.580
- Oh, God. Goddamn it.
- He called the cops.

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.740
- Oh, we're busted.
- Busted? Oh, my God.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.420
- I'm not busted.
- Drive.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.860
No one is busted in a
bad sense of the word.

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.100
- Too late. Lupe's got us. Pull in.
- Put your head in my lap.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:56.340
Honey, no one's head's going in my lap. It's
something guys are saying now. I can't talk.

01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.220
- Hide, hide, hide.
- I am fucked.

01:03:58.320 --> 01:04:00.540
- Let's just go in. Be calm and be cool.
- Shit.

01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.660
- Hi.
- Gentlemen.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.060
- You own this establishment?
- This place here?

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.900
I don't know. Do you really
own anything in this lifetime?

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.300
- We're currently renting.
- It's all just material. Electrons, protons.

01:04:11.400 --> 01:04:12.831
- Yeah. We do.
- Technically.

01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.828
Let me ask you, has your company done
business recently with a Mr. Bert Hanson?

01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:22.580
- Barb Fanson? Doesn't ring a bell.
- Not really ringing a bell.

01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:24.780
- I don't think that we have.
- Not our guy.

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:27.820
That's interesting. The way I hear it,
you're working with him.

01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:30.820
And things didn't shake out
too well for you boys.

01:04:30.920 --> 01:04:32.260
- Oh, Bert.
- Oh. Bert Hanson.

01:04:32.360 --> 01:04:33.740
- Yeah.
- Is that what he said?

01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.140
- Bert Hanson? Oh, yeah. We know him.
- That guy.

01:04:36.240 --> 01:04:37.910
We had a business disagreement.

01:04:38.120 --> 01:04:39.660
- Big whoop.
- No big deal.

01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:42.900
- Water under the bridge.
- We're super friendly with the guy.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.060
You're very forgiving.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:47.500
Because almost everyone I've talked to
thinks he's an asshole.

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.460
- Do they think that?
- I could see that.

01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.700
Strong word. I don't know if I'd use it.

01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:55.300
We like the guy. Definitely don't think
his son deserves to be kidnapped.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:57.070
Kidnapped?

01:04:57.320 --> 01:04:59.422
Who said anything about kidnapping?

01:05:02.880 --> 01:05:04.106
- I wanna say you did.
- I didn't.

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:06.460
- I heard you say it.
- I didn't.

01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.380
- I feel like you did.
- I'm sure I did.

01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:11.100
You said "kidnapping."
I was like, "What a weird word."

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.588
- Should be more "kidnabbing."
- No, I did not. Did I say that?

01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.269
- I think you might have, sir.
- You sure?

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:21.749
Well, I got a little lost with
all their yammering, but pretty sure.

01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:26.060
All right, maybe I did.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:28.228
- Hey.
- It's been a long week.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:29.620
We'll be in touch.

01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:33.540
Yeah. Anytime you want. Don't worry,
because the main thing is that you said it...

01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:35.100
Stop talking. Stop talking.

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:37.740
You've done plenty, plenty of talking.

01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:40.910
Where you going? Come back here.
Come over here. We're going this way.

01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:45.580
I don't want you to thank me.
Just go home and enjoy your family.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:48.380
Enjoy the rest of the day off, everyone.
You've earned it.

01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.940
The police were just checking.
Making sure we're locking up at night.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:59.220
You know, they're keeping the
neighborhood safe. They're heroes.

01:05:59.320 --> 01:06:02.060
Okay, all taken care of.

01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.940
- No, everyone's gone.
- No, no, he...

01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:05.380
He's spinning out.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:09.141
I was really clear my life
was in danger.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:12.948
He called the police anyway.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.340
Yeah, and since he did...

01:06:16.440 --> 01:06:20.100
it's pretty clear that we're not gonna
be able to continue with the scam...

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:23.065
Five million dollars is nothing to him.

01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.140
But I guess it's worth more to him
than my life.

01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:30.580
- I'm his son, for chrissake.
- Oh, boy. We got a crier.

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:35.300
- Look how blue his eyes get when he's crying.
- I'm sorry. This is so fucking embarrassing.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.780
- Oh, no. No, no, no.
- No.

01:06:36.880 --> 01:06:38.900
Toilet paper here.
You can blow your nose.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.980
Just because your dad called the cops
doesn't mean he doesn't love you.

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.820
No, of course not. Oh, my gosh.
I'm sure it was just his first reaction.

01:06:46.920 --> 01:06:49.740
- He's scared, confused.
- It's natural. I mean, Dale's a dad.

01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.100
I'm a dad.

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:53.260
Can you imagine if someone
stole one of them?

01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.380
- I can't imagine.
- You would call the cops.

01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:58.260
No, I don't think I'd call the cops.
I couldn't take that risk.

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:01.341
- Different situation.
- Shit, I'm sorry.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:02.620
Bad example.

01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.700
Maybe some alone time would be helpful.

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.980
Why don't we step outside,
give him a minute?

01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.260
We'll come back, don't do anything rash.

01:07:09.360 --> 01:07:12.460
- Get the loose rope. I don't want him to...
- We can only hope.

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:14.389
Can I talk to you outside, please?

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.260
- Oh, boy.
- Man, I feel terrible for that guy.

01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:20.260
I know. Are you kidding me?
Poor, poor guy.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.620
- I mean, that is rough. Rough.
- Are you guys shitting me in there?

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.540
His dad sold him out for...
It was probably nothing to him.

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:28.180
- Pennies to him.
- The guy's rich.

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:31.380
That would rock me to my core.
Have a little empathy. Please?

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.500
Know what's going on? You're holding
a grudge right now. Yes, you do that.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.260
- You get all tight. You're gonna get cancer.
- You do.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:40.820
- I don't want that.
- Let the past be the past.

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:45.500
We're not in the fucking past. We're in
the goddamn present. And you guys...

01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.140
What are you talking about? You're acting
like you have Stockholm Syndrome.

01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.300
What is that?

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:51.620
- What, like jet lag?
- No.

01:07:51.720 --> 01:07:53.620
- Do I look tired to you?
- You don't. No.

01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:55.300
- You don't look tired.
- I'm fine.

01:07:55.400 --> 01:07:57.940
Stockholm Syndrome's when
you bond with your captors.

01:07:58.040 --> 01:08:00.820
Oh, okay. Well, then hold on a second.
He's the hostage.

01:08:00.920 --> 01:08:03.261
So this would be reverse
Stockholm Syndrome.

01:08:03.520 --> 01:08:05.980
Yeah, and we don't have that, okay?

01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.780
He's just a really, really,
really likable guy. I like him a lot.

01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.860
- He's really likable.
- The guy's a winner.

01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:13.580
It's nice to be around a winner.

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:17.420
- Oh, boy. It feels right, Nick. Come on.
- Here's what we're gonna do.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.540
We're gonna go in, tell him cops
were never part of this plan...

01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:23.346
and the shit ends now. Let's do it.

01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:28.060
- Okay, but hear us out about festering.
- Like you can't have a conversation.

01:08:28.160 --> 01:08:31.740
It was a wonderful idea.
Didn't work out.

01:08:31.840 --> 01:08:34.620
So I think the best thing to do
is just to pull the plug...

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:38.300
and you tell the police that the guys
who got you chickened out...

01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.180
let you go, they're long gone.

01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:44.260
- They didn't all chicken out.
- Now's not the time to back off, boys.

01:08:44.360 --> 01:08:47.660
I say we chop off a toe,
mail it to him and double the ransom.

01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:50.420
- Now you're talking. Chop, chop, chop.
- Yes! Wait, whose toe?

01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:52.860
- Not it. Not it. Not my toe.
- No one's toe.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:55.020
Keep your toes. Time to call it off.

01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:56.860
Nick. Nick. Come on.

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.062
- Nick, look at me.
- Oy.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.980
Look, man, if we give up now,
I'll be just fine, you know?

01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:04.220
But you guys, your employees,
for God's sake.

01:09:04.320 --> 01:09:06.380
- Dale's little boys.
- Girls, Kurt.

01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.026
- Hey, thanks. Yes.
- Yeah. You're all fucked.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.580
- Nick, come on.
- Come on.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:13.620
You can't roll over and die
when your back's against the wall.

01:09:13.720 --> 01:09:16.020
- Don't roll over and die.
- You gotta be careful.

01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:18.060
- You have to take what's yours.
- Take it!

01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.260
Put your name on it. Write your name
on it and say, "That's mine."

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:22.540
And take it.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.460
I think I'll take it from here, okay?

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.740
- He's got it.
- He's got it. Listen right here.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:29.180
- This is where you want it to come from.
- Not us.

01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.740
- I got it!
- Sorry, Rex. Sorry.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:33.783
- He's got it.
- Come on, man.

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.860
Help me help you get revenge
on my asshole dad...

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:39.900
- ...and get you paid a million bucks cash.
- Yes.

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.140
Boy, it sounds awesome,
but there's no way to get it done.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:45.740
That's not true. How about this?

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:49.100
How about if we just put our
heads together? We brainstorm a little.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:53.460
If we don't come up with a ransom plan
that you love, we pull the plug.

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.901
- Then you'd let us walk?
- You have my word.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.180
But if we do come up
with something really inspired...

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.382
then we're in it to win it.

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:06.627
Well, I can't stop anybody
from brainstorming.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:12.100
You're the best.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:14.541
- All right.
- I'll see you upstairs, man.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.420
Is "vagina" with a G or a J?

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:21.741
All right.

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.780
Let's run it down from the top.

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:28.462
Okay. First we tie up Rex in one
of those abandoned warehouses off 3rd.

01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:39.221
Then we call Bert on a dark phone.
It's prepaid and untraceable.

01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:45.629
Go to the bench on the 4th Street Bridge
to make the drop.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:48.620
Not long enough to trace the call.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.743
Goddamn it.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.900
These guys are pros.

01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.307
I want a tracer put in that bag.

01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.980
The police are sending everyone
they've got to watch the bridge.

01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.540
Weapons tight. Eyes on.

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.311
All right, tactical command, red team.

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.110
Here we go.

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.540
But when he gets there...

01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:19.860
he finds the dark phone
that I planted ahead of time.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:27.260
Then we call him from the second dark phone,
and tell him to proceed downtown.

01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:28.541
Hello.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:34.740
You'll wanna pull into the garage under
the Mandrake Hotel and park in Space 4421.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:36.380
There, you will find a red bag.

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:40.820
You will transfer the money into this bag, then
drive out and await the location of the drop.

01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.180
And we tell him if anyone follows
him in, his son's a fucking corpse.

01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.860
And when Bert drives
that far underground...

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.347
the police will lose the signal
from his wire.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:03.220
But when he arrives, instead of
finding a bag he finds you three.

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.580
Disguised. Armed. Dangerous.

01:13:05.680 --> 01:13:09.785
- Yeah, but the gun's not loaded, right?
- Of course not. Nobody gets hurt, come on.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.866
I then tell him to give me
his jacket and tie.

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.580
So just as the cops
are starting to sweat...

01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:25.820
Dad pulls out with the new red bag,
just as he was instructed.

01:13:25.920 --> 01:13:28.830
- Sir, we have the signal back.
- Thank God.

01:13:29.600 --> 01:13:33.386
Only it won't be my father driving.
It'll be our ringer.

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.540
- We're back on him, sir.
- How do you know it's him?

01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:40.460
I still have the cash
and I'm heading to the drop.

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:43.106
I guess it's him. Stay with him.

01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.260
So I drive to the Staples Center.

01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:48.623
Kings have Vancouver. Great matchup.
Place will be packed.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:54.780
Cops will stay with the money, wait for
the kidnappers to receive the drop.

01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.301
Hanson made the drop, stay on the money.

01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:04.827
We got our man. Take him down.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.546
Stay down.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:15.662
Son of a bitch.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.342
By the time the cops know
they've been had...

01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:23.629
Kurt's a ghost.

01:14:24.240 --> 01:14:27.230
And Nick and Dale
disappear with the cash.

01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:37.420
And, finally, I am rescued
from my hellish captivity.

01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:39.270
Thank you. Where's my dad?

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.900
Dad!

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.621
A week later, once the smoke clears,
we'll be sitting poolside, splitting up the cash.

01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:51.420
It's raining. Who wants it?
There's enough to share.

01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.660
Look what came. Who wants some tequila?

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.980
- It's cash.
- Thanks, babe.

01:14:58.080 --> 01:14:59.227
Hey, whoa, Dale.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.900
Get your goddamn kids
out of the fantasy.

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.180
Let them enjoy the pool,
let me enjoy the money.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.460
- They're not even allowed at this pool.
- I can't turn my mind off.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:09.260
- Guys. Guys. Guys.
- Will you stop it?

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:14.060
Come on. Let's not argue, okay?
We came up with an awesome plan.

01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.260
It is smart. It is mad creative.

01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:18.906
You know, you boys
continue to impress me.

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.900
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, man.

01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.380
- You came up with most of it, though.
- I did not.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:25.660
- You did.
- That is a lie. It was a team effort.

01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.500
You came up with going into the garage,
losing the signal.

01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:31.700
That was brilliant. Kurty came up
with the dark-phone business.

01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:34.900
- That's from "Grand Theft Auto." I took it.
- Genius. Dale...

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:38.900
I had the thing where you go on the zip line
to the trampoline to the skateboard.

01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:42.420
- Nick shot that down, if you remember.
- Yeah. It wasn't a good idea.

01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:44.140
It was a bad idea, it really was.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.981
You had a lot of bad ideas though
that led to good ideas. And that is value.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.785
Thanks, man.

01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:53.140
All right, Nick.
Look, my word is still good.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:56.423
You know, if you don't think
it can work, we call it off.

01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:58.864
It's up to you, buddy.

01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:02.620
Where do we get untraceable phones?

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.020
There we go. That's our guy.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.791
- This guy.
- There we go.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.460
Prepaid with bitcoins.

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:15.140
Jailbroken.

01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.820
A hundred percent untraceable.

01:16:16.920 --> 01:16:19.380
- We got it.
- Thanks. Solid. Thank you, Motherfucker.

01:16:19.480 --> 01:16:20.660
Good luck out there, boys.

01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:25.500
- What's that laugh about?
- I just said good luck.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:28.660
- That was a sinister giggle.
- You said it with a sinister giggle.

01:16:28.760 --> 01:16:31.780
I'm just saying that maybe you guys
might want a little advice.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:34.780
- Boy, that was predictable. No, thanks.
- We're good.

01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.460
- You know what, then? Get the fuck on.
- That's what I said. Get the fuck on.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.220
- Wait a minute.
- I don't like this.

01:16:40.320 --> 01:16:42.980
- I wanna hear what he has to say.
- Now you wanna hear?

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:46.707
- You got one on the hook.
- It'll cost 51 percent share of your company.

01:16:47.360 --> 01:16:48.980
You're out of your fucking mind.

01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:51.860
It's gonna cost you 2 percent share
of your company.

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:55.460
- So weird how you negotiate.
- It won't be in existence. You can have that.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:58.823
- There's a middle ground.
- Here's the advice, young men.

01:17:00.600 --> 01:17:02.509
Y'all criminals.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:05.300
- It's never good advice.
- I can't find the advice.

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.700
It's not even true, actually.
We're not criminals. All right?

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.540
- We got dicked into this.
- Shut up.

01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:13.180
See, you can't have this both ways.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.180
Every time you guys come here, you're like,
"We're a bunch of happy-go-lucky guys.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:20.500
Through no fault of our own,
we found ourselves in another pickle.

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:23.510
We can't get our fingers out
of our asses." Fuck that.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.460
You're fucking criminals.
You've tried to kill your bosses.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:31.140
One of them ended up dead. And now you
want to perpetrate a kidnapping?

01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:35.743
You three are the craziest motherfucking
criminals I've ever seen in my life.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.511
You wanna pull this shit off?

01:17:38.720 --> 01:17:40.106
You gotta act like it.

01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.261
Word.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.660
Oh. That was embarrassing.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.900
We're trying to do a super cool
slow-mo walk.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.500
- Come on, man.
- Easy.

01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.420
- It's over. Let's go.
- Where you going?

01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:03.540
- Moronic idea. I am mortified.
- Come on, man. Let's do the walk.

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.230
You gotta stick with it.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:11.380
What do you think?
Should I beat myself up more?

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:15.340
No, you don't need to hit yourself anymore.
I think we should just make the call.

01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:18.623
Hold on. Before we kick this thing off,
can I just say something?

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:23.540
I'm not really, good at this
kind of thing, you know?

01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:26.789
My mom died when I was 4, and...

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.466
You know, when you're raised
by Bert Hanson...

01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.584
most of your friends are shitheads.

01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:38.109
Yeah. I know I dragged you guys
into this, but I'm not sorry.

01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:40.631
Because...

01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:43.460
I'm really glad I met you guys.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.266
Anyway, I want you guys to have this.

01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:48.620
- What is it?
- It's an actual fang from Predator.

01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:50.265
- Predator the movie?
- Yep.

01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.580
I want you to have it.

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:53.986
- For real?
- Swear to God.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.661
Do you like Predator?

01:18:56.600 --> 01:18:57.980
Yeah, I like Predator.

01:18:58.080 --> 01:19:01.300
- Kurty?
- Yeah. Yeah, I like Predator too.

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:04.420
I mean "also," not the sequel.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:06.020
- Nick?
- Oh, well...

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:09.460
I didn't like Predator
when I first saw it...

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.504
but it grew on me quite a bit.

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.344
I like Predator a great deal.

01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:20.820
Are we talking about him or Predator?
I'm terrible with metaphors.

01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:23.180
- Let's make the phone call.
- It was lost on me.

01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:24.420
Most things are.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.140
Yeah.

01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:32.620
You got that cash?

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.500
- Yeah, I got it.
- Yeah.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:37.260
Now, I want you to sashay up
to the 4th Street Bridge.

01:19:37.360 --> 01:19:40.340
You're gonna find a bench about
halfway up, take a load off.

01:19:40.440 --> 01:19:43.660
And you bring the amount that we
agreed upon and you come alone.

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.182
And if you do, you will find your son
returned home lickety-splickety.

01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:52.260
Fourth Street Bridge, he's gonna
have him drop it over the side.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.340
Now, I want every inch covered,
but everyone holds a safe distance.

01:19:56.440 --> 01:19:58.660
Yeah, but not too safe a distance.
Understand?

01:19:58.760 --> 01:20:01.386
This bag is your number
fucking one priority.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.540
No, actually, your son's life
is our number one priority.

01:20:04.640 --> 01:20:06.071
Yeah, you know what I mean.

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.909
Yeah, I think I do.

01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.390
Does anybody have a visual?

01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:26.060
Bridge is still clear, chief.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:28.706
Hanson approaching. ETA, two minutes.

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:33.790
The Blade is in position.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:36.748
Majestic, in position.

01:20:37.120 --> 01:20:39.507
I am in...

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.742
Kill Shot is in position.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.466
- Whoa, "Kill Shot"?
- Yeah, I wanna be Kill Shot.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:48.980
- Then you are Kill Shot. I love it.
- Pretty sweet name there, Nick.

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.100
Ooh. We don't wanna use real names
if we're using code names, Dale.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:55.580
- Don't say my name, Kurt.
- Mine was an accident. Yours was on purpose.

01:20:55.680 --> 01:20:57.740
- I don't think yours was an accident.
- What?

01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.060
Why are we on walkie-talkies
in the same room?

01:21:00.160 --> 01:21:01.540
We're checking the equipment.

01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.100
We don't need to.
He's on a TV remote control.

01:21:04.200 --> 01:21:06.420
I was trying to participate.
I didn't have anything to...

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:10.260
Hey. Hold up. The Blade's got a visual.
He's here. He's here.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.700
- Here we go.
- Oh, shit.

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:14.860
- All right. Kill Shot, make the call.
- I'm dialing. Here we go.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:16.060
Oh, my God.

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.544
Hey, what's that? Who's calling you?

01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.829
- I don't know. It's blocked.
- Oh, no.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.740
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.300
- Who is this?
- It's me, dickless.

01:21:26.400 --> 01:21:28.380
You're supposed to call the dark phone.

01:21:28.480 --> 01:21:31.220
It's in your hand.
You were to tape that under the bench.

01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:33.502
No, that's not... Oh, wait.

01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:50.140
Oh, shit. So, what phone does he have?

01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:53.540
Bert has Kurt's phone
with our contact information on it.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:56.260
And the pictures of us
from when we used to be friends?

01:21:56.360 --> 01:21:58.580
Knock it off. Look, this is no big deal.

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:02.060
We'll do it tomorrow. As long as we
don't call, he'll never find it.

01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:03.261
He found it.

01:22:03.520 --> 01:22:04.860
- He what? How?
- We are screwed.

01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:07.660
- Shit.
- Wait, wait, wait. I got an idea. I got an idea.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:10.820
Call your phone. If he's talking,
he's not gonna look through it.

01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.540
- What's your number?
- You don't know?

01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:15.420
- I don't know my number.
- I don't know. I never call myself.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:17.340
I know both of your numbers. 323...

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:20.100
- That's all I need. I got there. Here we go.
- Okay, yes.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.507
- Here we go. Okay. All right. Ahem.
- Right, okay.

01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:28.627
Call coming in. "Roar" by Katy Perry.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:31.022
These guys are confident.

01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:32.620
Yeah, hello.

01:22:32.720 --> 01:22:34.540
Look like the grasshopper
found himself...

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.300
- ...a blade of grass to sit upon.
- Too much.

01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:40.540
- Hello.
- Let's get this over with, pretend cowboy.

01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:43.260
Now, listen, I need you to proceed
to the Mandrake Hotel.

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:47.420
I need you to go underground into parking.
I need you to get to Spot 4421.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:49.980
You're gonna see a big old bag there.
Fill it up.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:54.500
And then I need you to proceed north
onto Figueroa and await further instructions.

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.700
Wait, wait.

01:22:55.800 --> 01:22:59.980
And don't think we don't know you got the
law with you. That's something we do know.

01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.340
All right? So if any of them cavalry
follow you down in the garage...

01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:06.740
I'm personally gonna stick a hot poker
so far up your son's ass...

01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:10.661
I'm gonna pop his teeth like popcorn!

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:12.786
See? We're back on track.

01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:15.860
I gotta get that phone back.
So many dick pics.

01:23:15.960 --> 01:23:17.824
- Really?
- Yeah, not all mine, though.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:21.980
With game-time traffic, he could be here
in less than 10 minutes. How we doing?

01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.220
- Almost done.
- Where are the bellhop costumes?

01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.540
- What?
- Bellhop costumes.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.620
Aren't we dressed as bellhops
when we escape with the money?

01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:30.340
This place doesn't have bellhops.

01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.540
- It doesn't?
- No.

01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:34.220
I thought there was supposed to be
some sweet-ass...

01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.540
- What the fuck are these?
- It's not Halloween.

01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:38.980
- Best I could do on short notice.
- It's not scary.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.220
- Hey, how do I look?
- Who the hell are you?

01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.060
- It's me, Kurt.
- I know that part.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:46.060
Terrible. You don't look like Bert,
you look like Mark Twain.

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.940
None of this is like I pictured when we were
planning it. Everything was cooler.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:52.300
He just has to look good
from a distance.

01:23:52.400 --> 01:23:54.540
- Here we go. Let's do it.
- Let's roll.

01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:58.380
Let's just do what we gotta do, do it
confidently and, we should be fine.

01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:00.220
- Here we go.
- Oh.

01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.741
- Hi, boys.
- Oh, hi.

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.223
You staying at the hotel, or is this
your hotel? You staying here?

01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:11.020
I've been keeping my eye on you
since you broke into my office.

01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:14.140
I don't know what's going on here,
and I don't give a shit.

01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:17.700
- Why are you here? What do you want?
- I think you know what I want.

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:19.420
No, I'm not gonna sleep with you.

01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:21.900
Why can't this crazy bitch
get it through her head?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:24.540
- Keep it respectful. Sorry.
- Are you kidding me?

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.140
- Don't call her that.
- I'm gonna make this simple.

01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:29.460
I'm gonna call the police
and send you to jail.

01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:30.740
- Don't do that.
- Come on.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.704
Unless Dale plows me.

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:35.660
Why? Why me?
What is so special about me?

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:38.180
That's a fair question.
Everybody's wondering.

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.940
- I am.
- Did you ever collect anything, Dale?

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:43.380
- Don't get him going on this.
- What do I collect?

01:24:43.480 --> 01:24:45.180
- Tons of stuff.
- Encyclopedia Brown?

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.100
- New Beanie Babies, makes no sense.
- Battlestar Galactica.

01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.260
- Fine. I collect some stuff. Why?
- Okay, well, I collect cocks.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:52.580
- Cogs?
- Julia.

01:24:52.680 --> 01:24:54.780
- "Cocks."
- Oh, yeah. Well...

01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:56.860
Right up here.

01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:01.580
I've got quite an impressive trophy room
filled with cocks.

01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:03.020
- We're in there.
- Don't.

01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.984
And at night, when I close my eyes...

01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.981
I reflect on them...

01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.260
I alphabetize them...

01:25:09.880 --> 01:25:10.980
I dust them.

01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.780
Why are they dusty?

01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:15.187
But there's one little problem, Dale.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:19.820
See that space?
That empty space above the fireplace?

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:22.349
- See that?
- You got a cock missing?

01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:27.343
That's reserved for the only man
who's ever said no to this.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:29.982
Since I was 11 years old.

01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:32.983
That's you, Dale.

01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:34.581
My white whale.

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:38.860
Oh, okay. Well, I appreciate that.
I really do. That's sweet, I guess.

01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:41.820
But, hey, here's an idea.
My friend Kurt here loves to plow.

01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:44.260
- And maybe he could jump in for me...
- Absolutely.

01:25:44.360 --> 01:25:46.500
I could pinch-plow.
I got a real green thumb.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:52.020
We all know this is just the addiction talking.
If you're looking for more than a quick fix...

01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:55.380
I can provide you something
that's very meaningful, long-lasting.

01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:56.911
What? What are you talking about?

01:25:57.160 --> 01:25:58.420
I'm talking about us.

01:25:58.520 --> 01:26:00.380
- Us? All of us?
- No.

01:26:00.480 --> 01:26:01.620
- That's even better.
- No.

01:26:01.720 --> 01:26:05.020
More the merrier. I love this idea.
You got a lot of stuff sticking out.

01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:06.780
I got a lot of holes going in.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:10.780
At one point of the night, you'd better
make sure that, that one is in this one.

01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:13.580
- Thank you.
- That's not what I meant. You misunderstood.

01:26:13.680 --> 01:26:18.149
I'm gonna go freshen up. Why don't you
guys suck each other off to get ready?

01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:20.300
- Here we go.
- What are you doing?

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.940
What? She's making us fuck her.

01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.900
- I'm not gonna fuck anyone.
- Thank you.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.460
I'm willing to make love to her,
if that's required.

01:26:26.560 --> 01:26:28.822
- Are you serious?
- Can I borrow this razor?

01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.380
Yeah. Go nuts.

01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:32.700
Any requests? Landing strip?
Dinner roll?

01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:35.140
Whatever's there.
We're in a rush. Thanks.

01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:38.060
I don't wanna commit
adultery on my wife.

01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:41.540
No, it's not adultery if you're doing it
to save your family. Okay?

01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:44.420
You think Stacy and your girls
are gonna wait for you...

01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:47.060
- ...while you're in prison for 30 years?
- They're not.

01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:49.780
Can't we just come up
with some kind of plan, though?

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.980
Oh, yes. Absolutely. I got a plan.
Okay, here we go. Areas.

01:26:53.080 --> 01:26:54.820
I'll go butt, face, puss.

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:57.660
I cannot go in the puss.
That'll make me the most guilty.

01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:01.300
- Good call. How about this? Butt, face, puss.
- That's where I should be.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.460
I'm talking about a way where...
That's good.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:06.540
If we're switching positions,
she'll lose track of who's where.

01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.100
- Like the shell game.
- Three-card Monte. Exactly.

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.820
I can motorboat her boobies
and then smack on her butt.

01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:14.500
So long as nothing is done
in a cheap or degrading way.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:18.140
- We'll be as sensitive as Dr. Phil.
- I don't know if I can fuck this woman.

01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.700
- Think about your wife and girls.
- I'll think about my girls. I can get it done.

01:27:22.300 --> 01:27:24.187
All right?

01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:26.420
- Stacy.
- Oh, no.

01:27:26.520 --> 01:27:28.543
- How did you find me?
- Been there a while?

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:30.504
Find My iPhone.

01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:33.300
- I knew you were cheating on me.
- No, I'm not.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:36.180
- He's not. We're trying to stay out of prison.
- Prison?

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:37.540
No one's going to prison.

01:27:37.640 --> 01:27:40.660
- Because we were gonna kidnap someone.
- Kidnapping?

01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:43.300
- No. First, the man kidnapped himself.
- That's right.

01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.460
- He forced us...
- Dale wouldn't even do puss.

01:27:45.560 --> 01:27:48.340
- I didn't even wanna do the puss.
- I chose ass both times.

01:27:48.440 --> 01:27:52.220
I said puss will make me the most guilty.
You're not helping me! Shut up!

01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:54.340
Look, this is such
a stupid thing, honey.

01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:56.980
And easy, and nothing sexual
is even happening here.

01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.104
Come on, Dale,
this pussy isn't gonna eat itself.

01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:02.380
- Julia?
- Stacy.

01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:03.780
And the babies.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:06.980
Look at those babies.
Oh, Dale, they look just like you.

01:28:07.080 --> 01:28:08.700
- Listen to me.
- You are sick.

01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.507
- I'm not sick. Please. Can I just...?
- Do not follow me. Do not follow me.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:14.026
You fucking bitch.

01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.351
Sorry. Really didn't mean
for that to happen.

01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:19.948
Okay, Julia. You wanna fuck?

01:28:20.200 --> 01:28:21.301
Yeah.

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:24.380
Why not, right? My marriage is over.
It's basically ruined.

01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:26.740
So how about I ruin that pussy?
That sound good?

01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:28.540
- No, no, no. You're face.
- I'm puss.

01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:30.740
- Yeah.
- No, no, no. This one's all mine.

01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:32.100
What?

01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:34.500
- Let's do it. Let's do it in the shower.
- Attaboy.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:37.020
Is that what you want?
Nice and wet in here.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.740
- I can't save my marriage from prison.
- No, you can't.

01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.624
- Great, Dale.
- Let's roll.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.460
- We lost the wire.
- Shit.

01:28:52.560 --> 01:28:54.660
Should we send in an unmarked?

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.022
We can't risk it. We'll hold here.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.100
Hello. Howdy-do.

01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.700
- You go on this side.
- Stop.

01:29:15.800 --> 01:29:17.260
Hey.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:18.700
What the fuck is this?

01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:23.667
I do not need that sass-mouth. What I need
is that sack of cash. Now, get it over here.

01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.820
Don't you throw it at me.
You slide it. Do it again.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:28.784
- No, we'll keep it here.
- Check it.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:33.820
- Holy shit.
- Lookie there.

01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:35.980
- We did it.
- There's a pretty bag.

01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:41.140
Okay. All right. Hey. I'll also take that phone
you took from the bottom of that bench.

01:29:41.240 --> 01:29:42.500
What?

01:29:42.600 --> 01:29:45.660
- The cell phone. Give me the cell phone.
- Throw the phone to him.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.580
Now that fancy jacket
and that snappy tie.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.580
- Get them off. Get them over.
- No.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.340
- He say "no"?
- I think he said no.

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:53.500
But we got this.

01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:56.465
- Don't make me use this six-shooter.
- Man's got a shooter.

01:29:56.840 --> 01:29:58.340
You make me sick.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:30:01.460
You're what's wrong with America.
Everyone just wants a handout.

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:04.860
Take, take, take from the people
who earn their money honestly.

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.860
All right, let's not chitchat now.
The man does have a gun.

01:30:07.960 --> 01:30:10.780
You got a real lip on you.
I will shoot you in the chest.

01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.940
Well, go ahead. Shoot me.

01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:16.420
- You don't have the balls.
- Yeah, he does. He got big old balls.

01:30:16.520 --> 01:30:18.588
Big mouth. Nothing behind it.

01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.460
- Dude.
- Oh, my God.

01:30:22.560 --> 01:30:23.860
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:25.100
What did you do?

01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:26.660
- You shot him.
- No, I didn't.

01:30:26.760 --> 01:30:28.940
- You did.
- That was not supposed to be loaded.

01:30:29.040 --> 01:30:31.220
- What do you mean?
- That's not my fault.

01:30:31.320 --> 01:30:32.540
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, hold...

01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:46.220
Man. You should've seen
your faces right now...

01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:48.060
when you started blaming each other.

01:30:50.400 --> 01:30:51.740
What's happening right now?

01:30:52.240 --> 01:30:53.820
I'm fucking you over.

01:30:53.920 --> 01:30:57.740
- No, no. But we're all friends now.
- We are, but what a great twist, right?

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:01.860
At first I was just gonna take all the money
and throw you guys under the bus.

01:31:01.960 --> 01:31:03.380
I mean, come on. Duh.

01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:07.869
But then when Dad called the cops
and proved he doesn't give a fuck about me...

01:31:08.320 --> 01:31:10.660
I realized, why take
a few of his millions...

01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:13.860
when I can inherit all of them
and you guys can take the fall?

01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:18.340
In minutes, the police will be down here and
discover that you killed my poor father...

01:31:18.440 --> 01:31:21.180
with a gun you stole from my room
when you abducted me.

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:22.905
That is a lie!

01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.980
- He knows.
- He knows. He knows.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.860
Don't worry, guys.

01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:30.780
I'll take it from here.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.630
Sorry, Rex.

01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:33.940
But we got you.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:36.180
Why take a few of his millions...

01:31:36.280 --> 01:31:38.900
when I can inherit all of them
and you guys can take the fall?

01:31:39.000 --> 01:31:40.740
Ooh. Checkmate, bitch.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:47.100
- All right, here. Let's have that.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:49.302
- No, I... Right. Sorry.
- Thanks, man.

01:31:49.720 --> 01:31:52.500
Didn't wanna hold onto that
for two more minutes?

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.623
No, that was a gift.

01:31:55.200 --> 01:31:58.060
- Did you park the Prius in the back alley?
- I sure did.

01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.388
- Do you have the keys?
- Here you go.

01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:06.067
I'm really proud of you guys.

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:10.107
Seriously. You pulled together.
You worked like a team. Just like we planned.

01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:12.420
Dale, we had a lot of laughs.

01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:15.191
I really appreciate it.
I mean, you made me smile.

01:32:16.680 --> 01:32:20.102
Nick, I want you to smile more.
You know? Look at those frown lines.

01:32:20.600 --> 01:32:22.782
Take a vacation. Lighten up.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:26.140
- Kurt, I think I'm gonna miss you the most.
- Why?

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:27.980
Okay.

01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.260
Bye.

01:32:29.360 --> 01:32:30.500
Catch.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:31.820
- Don't...
- Goddamn it.

01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:34.671
Sorry. I just have good hands.
Fuck. Hang on a second.

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:36.140
Hey, freeze. Freeze.

01:32:36.740 --> 01:32:39.180
Dale, come on.
You think I'd give you a loaded gun?

01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.706
Shit.

01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.026
I gotta get going. Gotta wait to be saved
at the warehouse by the cops. See you.

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:51.660
Oh, shit. Good luck talking to the cops.
You have your dad's blood all over... Oh!

01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:55.500
- Can we not keep anything to ourselves?
- Fuck me. I'm so sorry.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:59.860
- That's worse than what I did. What did I do?
- You're friends with him. You introduced me.

01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:02.940
We're not gonna be afraid of
an unloaded gun, Rex, you dipshit.

01:33:03.040 --> 01:33:06.747
- He's got bullets. He's got bullets.
- He's got bullets? Fucking hell.

01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.780
Kurt, what are you? A 32 waist?

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:11.500
- Oh, dear God. He's gonna rape us.
- No.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.226
- Oh, you just want my...
- He just wants the pants.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:24.700
All-time shittiest idea you guys ever had.
Can't believe you talked me into this.

01:33:24.800 --> 01:33:27.020
- This guy's dead now.
- I know that.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.180
- He's dead.
- We should've stayed cogs.

01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.145
This is taking too damn long.

01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:34.066
Shit.

01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.660
This isn't about the bag.

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.660
This is the goddamn drop.

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:41.900
Move in. Everybody move in now.

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:47.020
- Take off the incriminating pants.
- Run around in my underwear?

01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:49.540
Why not throw the body in the trunk?
We got 5 million bucks.

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:51.820
There's police everywhere.
We're not gonna get away.

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.950
Oh, shit.

01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.420
- Grab the bag. Get the fuck in.
- Why?

01:34:01.520 --> 01:34:04.271
Lead the cops to that warehouse
before your boy gets there.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:09.430
If they see him out walking free,
they just might believe your ass. Let's go.

01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:11.461
Get the money.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:27.900
Hey. Hey, guys.

01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:30.100
Goddamn it. It's those idiots.

01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.340
I knew I never said anything
about kidnapping.

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:37.180
- Come on. Let's go.
- Following us is already a part of their plan.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:40.540
- You never know. Wanna make sure.
- What is the seat-belt situation?

01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:42.420
- I got mine.
- We should put them on.

01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:45.066
- Can I get under yours?
- Hold on to the dashboard.

01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:48.540
- Shit.
- This is the wrong way.

01:34:48.640 --> 01:34:51.220
This is the wrong way. Turn around.
Stop the car.

01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:53.860
- Who you texting?
- My lady.

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.189
- Put it down.
- If I don't check in, she goes crazy.

01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.229
By the way, what the hell were you doing
back there in that garage in the first place?

01:35:07.640 --> 01:35:09.140
What's that, now?

01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.620
- Holy shit.
- What's going on?

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:13.020
You were down there
to steal the ransom money.

01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.700
Listen, I hustle, I don't steal.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:17.540
What the fuck does that...?
What were you doing in the garage?

01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:20.900
I was thinking there was a chance...

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.740
the drop might go south,
and that guy would kill y'all.

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:26.860
And in such a scenario,
you'd rather me have the cash than him.

01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:29.540
- He was betting against us.
- You motherfucker.

01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:33.340
- I was honoring your potential death.
- Honoring us?

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:34.540
What are we, samurai?

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:36.700
Wait, hold on. Oh, hey. Train.

01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:38.948
- Train! Train! Train!
- Train!

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.060
- Nice! Woo-hoo!
- Damn it.

01:35:47.160 --> 01:35:48.780
That's how you lose the cops.

01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:51.790
- We're not supposed to lose the cops.
- Don't lose the cops.

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:54.940
That's the whole idea.

01:35:55.040 --> 01:35:57.460
- It was a good thought.
- Going back. This is great.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.940
I wish you'd slow down.
You wouldn't make mistakes.

01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:02.746
Don't criticize the man.
He's doing the best he can.

01:36:04.080 --> 01:36:06.148
Here, I'll let them know. Hold on.

01:36:06.400 --> 01:36:08.980
Hey. We're back. We'll stay here...

01:36:09.440 --> 01:36:11.340
till all this shit goes by.

01:36:11.440 --> 01:36:12.826
Then we'll all roll.

01:36:13.240 --> 01:36:15.980
What the fuck are these assholes doing?

01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:18.260
- They get that?
- Yeah, I think so.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:20.780
- What's that you're carrying around?
- What is that?

01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:22.260
It's for my kitties.

01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:23.860
- You got kittens?
- Surprising.

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:26.860
- I can't have kittens?
- Why you always jumping on everything?

01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.109
- It's weird you're hauling around a cat stand.
- I love pussy.

01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:33.220
- Hey, can I hop out and piss?
- No. We're in a car chase.

01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:36.780
- Super long train. I feel I could get it done.
- It is a lot of freight.

01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:46.260
Hold the line

01:36:46.360 --> 01:36:48.420
It probably needs...

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:49.860
Love isn't always on time

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:56.740
Hold the line

01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:59.546
It's just too goddamn easy.

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.380
- I feel like I could have pissed by now.
- Let him go. Open the door.

01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.423
- Caboose coming.
- Shit.

01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:58.424
Oh, shit. Cops.

01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:01.231
- Cops. Cops.
- Shit.

01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:05.740
- What happened?
- You lost your stuff.

01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:08.181
- What? Damn it.
- Yeah, you lost your cat stuff.

01:38:09.440 --> 01:38:11.820
Okay, there's a man there.
Watch out for him.

01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.067
Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:16.980
- Hey, we're boxed in here.
- Not for long.

01:38:17.080 --> 01:38:19.900
- No, no, no.
- I've always wanted to do this.

01:38:22.440 --> 01:38:24.460
Gotta make it last

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.420
I touch you once

01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:28.702
I touch you twice

01:38:41.960 --> 01:38:43.266
Shit.

01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:51.905
What?

01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:57.140
So where is this place?

01:38:57.240 --> 01:38:59.547
It's up here. Under the bridge.

01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:03.180
- What are you doing?
- You're supposed to go under the bridge.

01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:05.303
Relax.

01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:11.460
- The wheels are locked.
- Pump the brakes.

01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:13.100
- Shift down.
- Put it in park.

01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:14.347
I can't think.

01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:29.340
Bet y'all loving this fence now.

01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:31.140
I've come around
to the whole fence thing.

01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:33.300
I would've loved a seat belt too.

01:39:33.400 --> 01:39:35.980
Well, what's the next part
of the plan, Motherfucker?

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:51.305
There. There. There.

01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.700
- Hey. Hey, he's not here. We beat him.
- What?

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.061
- We beat him.
- Hey.

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:09.660
Hey, nice job...

01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.023
- Where's Motherfucker?
- I don't know.

01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:14.861
Cops. Cops.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:20.665
Hey.

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:24.460
- Get out of the car.
- Easy.

01:40:24.560 --> 01:40:27.620
- Hands up.
- Relax. Please, put your guns down.

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:30.020
We didn't kill anybody. I swear to God.

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.620
- I don't give a goddamn. Tell it to the judge.
- We didn't kidnap anybody.

01:40:33.720 --> 01:40:36.100
He kidnapped himself.
He'll sneak in any second.

01:40:36.200 --> 01:40:39.383
- He was supposed to be tied up to that chair.
- Right behind you.

01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.822
Who? Him?

01:40:42.560 --> 01:40:43.820
Yeah.

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:45.780
Aw, that looks bad. That looks bad.

01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.260
- This fucking guy.
- You gotta believe us.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:52.260
That's them. Those three, they tortured me,
then said they were gonna kill my dad.

01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:54.622
- Oh, don't listen to that.
- That's garbage.

01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.500
Tell me he's okay. Please.

01:40:57.600 --> 01:41:00.021
- I'm sorry, son.
- No.

01:41:01.240 --> 01:41:03.460
- No.
- He killed his father.

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:06.260
- He's a very strong actor. Bravo.
- Don't buy it.

01:41:06.360 --> 01:41:08.260
- Get on the ground.
- We're getting down.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:11.900
I can't believe you're buying that acting.
I mean, it's good, but...

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:14.421
You have the right to
remain silent, assholes.

01:41:14.800 --> 01:41:17.860
You have the right to
an attorney, asshole. You have...

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.260
Hey. Hey, that's my phone.
He has my phone.

01:41:24.360 --> 01:41:26.860
- The phone Bert had on the bench.
- Check that phone.

01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:30.860
If he was tied up here the whole time,
how could Rex have the same phone?

01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:33.260
- They switched pants!
- Yeah. They got it.

01:41:33.360 --> 01:41:35.428
- Check it.
- It's the same ringtone, sir.

01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:37.780
Yeah. That's my phone.

01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:40.631
I have the same ringtone.
It's an inspiring ringtone.

01:41:40.840 --> 01:41:43.180
You were here this whole time
with a cell phone...

01:41:43.280 --> 01:41:45.220
and didn't bother to call the police?

01:41:46.120 --> 01:41:49.429
- Yes.
- Shut the fuck up.

01:41:50.720 --> 01:41:51.780
Let me see it.

01:41:51.880 --> 01:41:53.982
I said let me see it.

01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:56.185
Okay.

01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:01.340
- Everybody move the fuck off.
- Yeah, he looks pretty guilty now, right?

01:42:01.440 --> 01:42:03.660
He's definitely suspect.

01:42:03.760 --> 01:42:05.140
Drop your fucking guns.

01:42:05.240 --> 01:42:07.980
You shoot this prick.
You shoot this prick right now.

01:42:08.080 --> 01:42:11.660
You drop your guns or I'll blow his
fucking head off. You hear me? Move.

01:42:11.760 --> 01:42:13.021
Move.

01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:16.340
He's gonna get away with this.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.980
- This guy doesn't quit.
- He's incredibly resilient.

01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:22.180
- You. Keys in the car?
- Keys are in the car.

01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:24.460
- This fucking guy.
- Calm down.

01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:27.900
This fucking guy took everything from me.
"Calm down, Dale"? No.

01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.020
- Fuck this fucking guy. He took my wife.
- All right, step away.

01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:34.660
- He took my kids. I'm gonna do something.
- Easy. What are you gonna do?

01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:38.069
- Look who's the predator now, bitch.
- Wait, Dale. What are you doing?

01:42:43.680 --> 01:42:45.430
- Dale.
- Oh, I'm shot.

01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.580
Get in there. Get him.

01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:53.340
Cuff this crazy asshole. And beat
the shit out of him while you're at it.

01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:55.420
- Oh, shit.
- Dale, buddy, you okay? Hey.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:56.620
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

01:42:56.720 --> 01:42:58.340
- Oh, shit.
- What was that?

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.180
Dale, let's put this down.
What was the plan here, buddy?

01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:04.540
- I overreacted. It's not even sharp.
- Adrenaline.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:06.020
Did it just graze me, or...?

01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:09.060
No, you got hit right in
the square of the fucking chest.

01:43:09.160 --> 01:43:11.300
- Went straight through.
- You're gonna be fine.

01:43:11.400 --> 01:43:13.820
No, I don't know about that.
That's a lot of blood.

01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:16.300
- Don't listen to him. You're gonna make it.
- Fuck.

01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:18.380
Hey, if you want hope, listen to him.

01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.940
If you want the truth, I'm your fucking guy,
all right? This is bad news.

01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:25.660
- Can we get some help here?
- Don't worry. We're gonna get you fixed up.

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.022
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Is it bad? Is it bad?

01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.860
- That's a big fucking hole.
- Yeah.

01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:33.540
- I'm gonna go to this light right here.
- If you've gotta go, you gotta go.

01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:37.301
- Please don't let me die with him talking.
- I'll take care of Stacy and your boys.

01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:47.860
- That couldn't be more annoying.
- I'm not trying to be annoying.

01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:49.860
- I'm trying to have fun.
- It's annoying.

01:43:49.960 --> 01:43:53.060
- It worked though. Look at that.
- Look who's talking. You okay?

01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.980
You've been drifting in and out.
Nice to hear you talking.

01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.220
So, what do the doctors say?
Am I gonna die?

01:43:58.320 --> 01:43:59.581
- Yes.
- Yes?

01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:01.620
- No.
- We're all gonna die.

01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:04.100
It's been touch-and-go,
but you're gonna be fine.

01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:05.620
Doctors are gonna let you out.

01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:08.380
- That's good.
- They did have to give you a bird's heart.

01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:09.900
- Oh, God.
- You okay with that?

01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:11.220
- No.
- He's kidding.

01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:14.020
- We're kidding.
- That heart would've been too old for me.

01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:15.180
How long was I out?

01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.660
- Two years.
- Really?

01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.020
- Four days.
- That's better.

01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.820
Why didn't you play?
Thought we were gonna say two years.

01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.420
We've got a woman president.

01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.260
Shit.

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:27.460
- Look who's here.
- Oh, my gosh. He's talking.

01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:29.820
- You're talking. Hi.
- We'll leave you alone.

01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:33.900
Please. Let me explain everything to you,
there are so many misunderstandings.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.980
- It's okay. Julia explained everything.
- Don't talk to her. She's crazy.

01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:41.380
She told me everything she put you
through because of her affliction.

01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.860
"Her affliction"?

01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:45.020
It's heartbreaking
what she's been through.

01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:47.580
- Hi.
- She also told me that my husband...

01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.465
is the only one that ever resisted her.

01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:53.940
- Okay.
- Dale, you are one lucky man.

01:44:54.040 --> 01:44:56.700
Your wife is so understanding
and caring.

01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:59.740
- Right.
- So beautiful.

01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.700
She has been so supportive
with the babies. And helpful.

01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:05.940
Oh. Please, it's the least I can do
to make amends for my bad behavior.

01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:07.140
Okay.

01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:09.580
I'm gonna find Dr. Mike,
tell him you're talking.

01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:13.300
Okay, good. Go get the doctor
because I'm feeling a little...

01:45:13.400 --> 01:45:14.780
What is going on here?

01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:18.780
What's up? I'm off the hook? No more
white-whale business? Or any of that?

01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:21.506
- No more. You're off the hook.
- Really?

01:45:22.880 --> 01:45:27.260
Did you know that when men are in a coma
they can still get an erection?

01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:29.980
It's true, Dale. Coma boners.

01:45:30.080 --> 01:45:31.940
"Coma boner"? What?

01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.220
Lots and lots of coma boners.

01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:39.340
Think about it.

01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:41.460
- Oh, shit.
- All right, well, I better go.

01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:44.186
I'm booking a spa day for me and Stacy.

01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:49.500
- I'm gonna fuck your wife, Dale.
- No, no.

01:45:49.600 --> 01:45:52.900
No. No, you're not.
Hang on. Hang on. No.

01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:55.060
- Hey, there she is.
- Boys.

01:45:55.160 --> 01:45:59.500
You look fantastic. You know, I've been
sending you a lot of unanswered texts.

01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:03.300
- That's not how you catch them.
- I think she said she's gonna fuck my wife.

01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.300
- Thought she already did.
- That horse may have left the barn.

01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:08.500
I figured those guys
have been bumping tacos.

01:46:08.600 --> 01:46:11.780
- Super touchy-feely lately.
- I can't process this. This is too much.

01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:14.140
Anyway, so, what's even going on?

01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:17.140
- Did we get in trouble with the police, or...?
- We did, yeah.

01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:20.071
- Yeah. A lot.
- We got arrested for a long list of felonies.

01:46:22.440 --> 01:46:25.740
But because you took a bullet for
the detective, DA got rid of the biggies.

01:46:25.840 --> 01:46:28.900
- Dropped some charges? Nice.
- You're like a little Kevin Costner.

01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.306
You're our bodyguard.

01:46:30.520 --> 01:46:33.500
Pretty sweet. All right,
so I'm guessing we saved the business.

01:46:33.600 --> 01:46:35.111
- Nope. We did not.
- We did not.

01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.144
The bank foreclosed a couple days ago.

01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:43.060
Going once, going twice, sold.
To D.H. Commercial Trust.

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:47.060
But there's good news. The guy who bought
the company is keeping us on to run it.

01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:52.220
- If we bring that down to $300, you've got...
- Lupe. All right.

01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:53.500
Hola, Lupe.

01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.103
- SkyMall?
- Sí, SkyMall.

01:46:59.640 --> 01:47:00.860
Great. That's great news.

01:47:00.960 --> 01:47:03.980
- SkyMall order is ready to ship.
- The boss is gonna love that.

01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:06.387
Yes. Let's go show him
these great numbers too.

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.784
Are we happy with these numbers?

01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:13.940
They're pretty good.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:16.020
- Room for improvement.
- We can do better.

01:47:16.120 --> 01:47:17.300
Oh, my God.

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:20.660
I just realized. You actually thought
you were bringing me good news.

01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:24.421
The three of you walked in with smiles
on your fucking pathetic faces.

01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:27.420
Why were you born?
Why were the three of you born?

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:31.020
Looking at you is like looking out
over the Grand Canyon of ineptitude.

01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.380
It's a wonder your parents
didn't smother you...

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.220
- Where you going?
- See you next week.

01:47:35.320 --> 01:47:37.660
I have an idea.
Why don't you try a suicide pact?

01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:41.860
And I'm not talking about throwing yourself
off a building or some sleeping-pills shit.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:44.142
I'm talking about,
you fuck each other to death.

01:47:44.360 --> 01:47:47.145
Where the fuck do you think
you're going? I own you!

01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:58.860
Well, we have several franchise
opportunities available in your area.

01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:01.780
But, purchasing a store requires...

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:04.900
a significant up-front investment.

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.944
Well, in that case...

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:14.780
start me off with three locations.

01:48:14.880 --> 01:48:18.100
I'm sure that we can
accommodate you, Mr. Jones.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.420
Please. Mr. Jones? That's my daddy.

01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.270
Call me Motherfucker.

01:48:29.400 --> 01:48:31.309
Every... This guy.

01:48:33.760 --> 01:48:37.980
Okay. First we tie up Rex in one
of those abandoned warehouses off 3rd.

01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:42.304
First we're gonna tie up Rex...

01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:45.660
First we're gonna tie up Rex...
Fuck off, everyone.

01:48:45.760 --> 01:48:50.180
As soon as Bert's car is underground,
the police lose...

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:52.420
Bert's car goes underground, right?

01:48:52.520 --> 01:48:54.987
Police lose the signal from the wire.

01:48:57.880 --> 01:49:01.220
Do you guys validate parking? Not you
personally, obviously, that'd be racist.

01:49:03.880 --> 01:49:06.221
You're gonna pull into Space 4421...

01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.860
I gotta call you back.

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:12.940
The bank foreclosed two days ago.

01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:16.260
- Hey, but there is good news.
- Really?

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.020
"Really?"

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:22.020
We need to talk to somebody legitimate.

01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:26.225
We need to find someone
who can get us our company back.

01:49:27.840 --> 01:49:30.460
I can't take you to the next scene
any better than that. I can't.

01:49:31.760 --> 01:49:34.140
Well, then I would marry Daniel Craig...

01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.540
I'd fuck Sean Connery
and kill Timothy Dalton.

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:40.300
I would marry Ed Helms, fuck Bradley
Cooper and kill Zach Galifianakis.

01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:44.860
Marry Crackle, fuck Snap,
kill Pop. Right?

01:49:44.960 --> 01:49:46.740
Oh, my God.
Do you know what this looks like?

01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.226
What?

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:50.620
It looks like we don't know
what we're doing.

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:53.900
Boy, I'd love it if you'd stop
saying my name.

01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:59.420
Hang on a second. Hey, freeze.

01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:01.740
Guess who's got the gun now.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:03.260
Me.

01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:10.100
Where do you think she learned it?

01:50:10.200 --> 01:50:12.621
Maybe from the first movie.

01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:18.980
- Get that chair ready. I'm gonna take a tinkle.
- Oh, but I'm thirsty.

01:50:19.080 --> 01:50:20.500
Save me a shake.

01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:23.510
I just can't say it.

01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:27.700
So you wanna use the ransom...

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:29.060
What is it?

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:32.900
"Y'all plan to use the ransom
to save y'all business."

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:34.460
I just like to hear you say it.

01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:38.300
Come on, man.

01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:40.860
Help me help you get revenge
on my asshole...

01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:44.862
- My asshole...
- Asshole dad.

01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:51.060
You have to take what's
yours in this... In this...

01:50:52.680 --> 01:50:54.620
- I mean, you have to...
- You have to...

01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:57.220
- ...take what's yours in this life.
- Take it.

01:50:57.320 --> 01:50:58.660
Grab it!

01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:03.900
You will pass your empty,
sac-less ball sacs...

01:51:04.000 --> 01:51:05.100
No, that's...

01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:10.905
"Empty shriveled sacs." They're shriveled.
I should know that just looking at you.

01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:20.740
That's your credit picture right there.

01:51:24.040 --> 01:51:26.260
- Here comes the heavy.
- I smell dog shit.

01:51:26.360 --> 01:51:27.905
- Do you really?
- Yeah.

01:51:28.960 --> 01:51:30.540
It might be your acting.
