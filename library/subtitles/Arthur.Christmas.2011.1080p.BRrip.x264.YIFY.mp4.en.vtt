Dear Santa, are you real?

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.588
If you live at the North Pole,

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:32.341
how come I can't see your house
when I look on Google Earth?

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.511
Are you Saint Nicholas?

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.139

have you eaten in all of history?

00:01:47.733 --> 00:01:50.902
How do you get all the presents
in the sack?

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.404
Does your sack have to
get bigger every year

00:01:53.572 --> 00:01:56.407

population growth?

00:01:56.575 --> 00:01:58.826

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:01.496

in one minute,

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.335

the whole world in just one night?

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:24.477

00:02:24.645 --> 00:02:26.437
that you'd have to go so fast,

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:31.400
it would make you and the sleigh
and the reindeer all burn up.

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:35.530

But how do you do it?

00:02:35.697 --> 00:02:40.576
For Christmas I would love
a pink Twinkle Bike with stabilizers.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:44.705

Missed a child. Dear, oh dear,

she's the one kid in the world

It's impossible.
