00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.030
I hope you don't mind me
taking the liberty.

3
00:05:46.166 --> 00:05:50.437
I was careful
not to drag in any dirt.

4
00:05:51.738 --> 00:05:53.741
I don't mind the dirt.

5
00:05:55.474 --> 00:05:56.976
I do mind

6
00:05:58.044 --> 00:05:59.779
unannounced visits.

7
00:06:03.216 --> 00:06:04.518
You police?

8
00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:11.155
Are you Sapper Morton?
Civic number NK68514?

9
00:06:11.157 --> 00:06:13.523
I'm a farmer.

10
00:06:13.525 --> 00:06:14.527
I saw that.

11
00:06:15.594 --> 00:06:16.964
What do you farm?

12
00:06:24.604 --> 00:06:25.671
It's a protein farm.

13
00:06:26.906 --> 00:06:28.442
Wallace design.

14
00:06:30.609 --> 00:06:31.911
Is that what I smell?

15
00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.645
Grow that just for me.

16
00:06:35.647 --> 00:06:36.914
Garlic.

17
00:06:36.916 --> 00:06:37.985
Garlic.

18
00:06:38.918 --> 00:06:40.487
Go on, try some.

19
00:06:41.688 --> 00:06:43.123
No, thank you.

20
00:06:45.058 --> 00:06:46.691
I prefer to keep
an empty stomach

21
00:06:46.693 --> 00:06:49.493
until the hard part
of the day is done.

22
00:06:51.964 --> 00:06:53.864
How long you been here?

23
00:06:53.866 --> 00:06:56.633
Since 2020.

24
00:06:56.635 --> 00:06:59.640
But you haven't always
been a farmer, have you?

25
00:07:01.106 --> 00:07:02.974
Your bag.

26
00:07:02.976 --> 00:07:05.176
It's colonial medical use.

27
00:07:05.178 --> 00:07:06.779
Military issue.

28
00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:12.518
Where were you? Calantha?

29
00:07:16.589 --> 00:07:18.559
Must have been brutal.

30
00:07:19.258 --> 00:07:20.960
Plan on taking me in?

31
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.830
Let them take a look inside?

32
00:07:25.832 --> 00:07:28.231
Mr. Morton,

33
00:07:28.233 --> 00:07:30.971
if taking you in
is an option,

34
00:07:34.974 --> 00:07:39.042
I would much prefer that
to the alternative.

35
00:07:39.044 --> 00:07:42.780
I'm sure you knew
it would be someone in time.

36
00:07:43.983 --> 00:07:46.687
I'm sorry it had to be me.

37
00:07:48.887 --> 00:07:51.825
Good as any.

38
00:07:54.693 --> 00:07:59.030
Now, if you don't mind,

39
00:07:59.032 --> 00:08:02.032
if you could just look up
and to the left, please.

40
00:08:58.657 --> 00:09:00.993
Please don't get up.

41
00:09:11.738 --> 00:09:15.142
How's it feel
killing your own kind?

42
00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:22.014
I don't retire my own kind
because we don't run.

43
00:09:24.017 --> 00:09:25.815
Only older models do.

44
00:09:25.817 --> 00:09:30.356
And you new models
are happy scraping the shit

45
00:09:35.027 --> 00:09:38.065
because you've never
seen a miracle.

46
00:10:18.970 --> 00:10:20.139
Just photograph everything.

47
00:10:32.451 --> 00:10:34.818
Madam, please.

48
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.454
<i>Incoming LAPD re-codec hash.</i>

49
00:10:40.459 --> 00:10:42.863
<i>You're hurt.
I'm not payin' for that.</i>

50
00:10:44.296 --> 00:10:45.798
- I'll glue it.
- <i>And?</i>

51
00:10:52.472 --> 00:10:54.505
<i>One of the tail-end Nexus 8s.</i>

52
00:10:54.507 --> 00:10:56.877
<i>He looks like he could
take your head off.</i>

53
00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:58.808
He tried.

54
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.810
<i>He went AWOL after Calantha</i>

55
00:11:00.812 --> 00:11:04.247
<i>with a few more in his outfit
I wouldn't mind closin' out.</i>

56
00:11:04.249 --> 00:11:07.117
- <i>Just him?</i>
- Just him.

57
00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:08.320
<i>Come on home
for your baseline.</i>

58
00:11:13.091 --> 00:11:14.360
One moment, madam.

59
00:12:02.841 --> 00:12:04.910
30 meters to maximum depth.

60
00:12:20.392 --> 00:12:21.460
<i>What is that?</i>

61
00:12:27.465 --> 00:12:28.902
<i>I'll send a dig team.</i>

62
00:12:30.302 --> 00:12:32.238
<i>Come on home before the storm.</i>

63
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:52.650
<i>Officer KD6-3.7.</i>

64
00:13:52.652 --> 00:13:55.318
<i>- Let's begin. Ready?
- Yes, sir.</i>

65
00:13:56.955 --> 00:13:58.422
<i>Recite your baseline.</i>

66
00:13:58.424 --> 00:14:01.494
<i>And blood-black
nothingness began to spin</i>

67
00:14:03.362 --> 00:14:06.196
<i>A system of cells
interlinked within cells</i>

68
00:14:06.198 --> 00:14:07.463

<i>interlinked within one stem.</i>

70
00:14:09.334 --> 00:14:11.137
Fuck off, skin-job.

71
00:14:12.671 --> 00:14:15.371
<i>And dreadfully distinct
Against the dark,</i>

72
00:14:15.373 --> 00:14:17.540

Interlinked.

Thank you, sir.

<i>Caution, keep clear.</i>

104
00:15:16.102 --> 00:15:17.938

111
00:16:25.371 --> 00:16:29.106
"K"? I didn't hear you.
You're early.

112
00:16:29.108 --> 00:16:31.207
You want me to come back?

113
00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:32.342
Just go scrub.

114
00:16:32.344 --> 00:16:33.512
Yes, ma'am.

115
00:16:35.281 --> 00:16:36.715
How was your meeting?

116
00:16:38.651 --> 00:16:41.084
The usual.

117
00:16:41.086 --> 00:16:43.853
How was your day?

118
00:16:43.855 --> 00:16:46.722
I'm getting cabin fever.

119
00:16:46.724 --> 00:16:50.195
<i>99.9% detoxified water.</i>

120
00:16:53.665 --> 00:16:58.802
I had an accident at work.
I think I ruined my shirt.

121
00:16:58.804 --> 00:17:01.104
I'm sure
I can fix that for you.

122
00:17:01.106 --> 00:17:02.508
Let me take a look at it.

123
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.383
I need a drink.

124
00:17:11.417 --> 00:17:12.748
Do you want a drink first?

125
00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.253
Mmm-hmm.
Pour me one, will ya?

126
00:17:16.721 --> 00:17:18.721
I'm trying a new recipe.

127
00:17:18.723 --> 00:17:20.457
I just need
a bit more practice.

128
00:17:20.459 --> 00:17:21.658
Don't fuss.

129
00:17:24.563 --> 00:17:27.296
I should have
marinated it longer.

130
00:17:27.298 --> 00:17:28.767
I hope it isn't dry.

131
00:17:31.269 --> 00:17:32.902
Did you know
this song was released

132
00:17:32.904 --> 00:17:36.406
in 1966 on Reprise Records?

133
00:17:36.408 --> 00:17:38.311
It was number one
on the charts.

134
00:17:43.649 --> 00:17:45.482
It won't be much longer.

135
00:17:45.484 --> 00:17:47.554
Just putting on
the finishing touches.

136
00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:55.559
Okay, it's ready.
I hope you're gonna like it.

137
00:17:55.561 --> 00:17:57.593
I told you not to fuss.

138
00:17:59.431 --> 00:18:00.700
And yet...

139
00:18:03.701 --> 00:18:06.372
Voilà! Bon appétit.

140
00:18:09.275 --> 00:18:11.244
I missed you, baby sweet.

141
00:18:13.211 --> 00:18:15.344
Honey, it's beautiful.

142
00:18:15.346 --> 00:18:17.150
Just put your feet up.

143
00:18:17.815 --> 00:18:19.251
Relax.

144
00:18:37.635 --> 00:18:39.338
Was a day, hmm?

145
00:18:40.806 --> 00:18:42.374
It was a day.

146
00:18:43.475 --> 00:18:44.544
Would you read to me?

147
00:18:45.777 --> 00:18:48.611
It'll make you feel better.

148
00:18:48.613 --> 00:18:50.783
- You hate that book.
- I don't wanna read either.

149
00:18:53.652 --> 00:18:55.352
Let's dance.

150
00:18:55.354 --> 00:18:57.521
Do you wanna dance, or do you
wanna open your present?

151
00:18:57.523 --> 00:18:58.825
What present?

152
00:19:02.961 --> 00:19:04.428
This one.

153
00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:05.532
What's the occasion?

154
00:19:06.398 --> 00:19:08.631
Let's just say

155
00:19:08.633 --> 00:19:10.903
- it's our anniversary.
- Is it?

156
00:19:12.805 --> 00:19:17.240
No, but let's just
say that it is.

157
00:19:17.242 --> 00:19:18.844
Okay?

158
00:19:22.914 --> 00:19:23.916
Happy anniversary.

159
00:19:25.784 --> 00:19:27.187
An emanator.

160
00:20:10.362 --> 00:20:11.894
Thank you.

161
00:20:11.896 --> 00:20:15.567
Honey, you can go anywhere
you want in the world now.

162
00:20:16.768 --> 00:20:18.604
Where do you wanna go first?

163
00:22:32.871 --> 00:22:35.141
I'm so happy
when I'm with you.

164
00:22:37.575 --> 00:22:38.844
You don't have to say that.

165
00:23:10.942 --> 00:23:14.244
<i>The dig's come through.
We have a new lead.</i>

166
00:23:14.246 --> 00:23:15.782
<i>Get down here.</i>

167
00:23:29.627 --> 00:23:33.165
<i>Carbon read: 14.6 GPH.</i>

168
00:23:53.751 --> 00:23:55.852
Your box
is a military footlocker

169
00:23:55.854 --> 00:23:58.554
issued to Sapper Morton,

170
00:23:58.556 --> 00:24:01.024
creatively repurposed
as an ossuary:

171
00:24:01.026 --> 00:24:03.259
a box of bones.

172
00:24:03.261 --> 00:24:05.096
Nothin' else in it but hair.

173
00:24:06.664 --> 00:24:08.564
The soil samples indicate that

174
00:24:08.566 --> 00:24:11.601
she's been buried
for 30 years.

175
00:24:11.603 --> 00:24:14.004
Bones all dismantled,
fully cleaned,

176
00:24:14.006 --> 00:24:15.839
meticulously laid to rest.

177
00:24:15.841 --> 00:24:17.043
"She"?

178
00:24:18.643 --> 00:24:19.745
Cause of death, Coco?

179
00:24:30.988 --> 00:24:35.091
No breaks,
no sign of trauma, except

180
00:24:35.093 --> 00:24:38.794
a fracture
through the ilium.

181
00:24:38.796 --> 00:24:41.765
It's a narrow birth canal.
Baby must have got stuck.

182
00:24:41.767 --> 00:24:44.935
- She was pregnant?
- Hmm.

183
00:24:44.937 --> 00:24:46.268
So he didn't kill her?

184
00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.138
Mmm. She died in childbirth.

185
00:24:49.975 --> 00:24:50.977
What's that?

186
00:24:52.944 --> 00:24:54.079
Go back.

187
00:24:54.813 --> 00:24:55.815
Closer.

188
00:24:58.083 --> 00:24:59.218
Closer.

189
00:25:02.286 --> 00:25:03.623
What's that?

190
00:25:05.257 --> 00:25:07.090
Huh.

191
00:25:07.092 --> 00:25:11.061
Notching in the iliac crest.

192
00:25:11.063 --> 00:25:15.332
It's fine-point,
like a scalpel.

193
00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:18.602
That looks like
an emergency C-section.

194
00:25:18.604 --> 00:25:21.873
The cuts are clean.
No sign of a struggle.

195
00:25:22.774 --> 00:25:25.675
He was a combat medic.

196
00:25:25.677 --> 00:25:27.643
Maybe he tried to save her
and he just couldn't.

197
00:25:27.645 --> 00:25:30.045
He didn't seem like
the saving type.

198
00:25:30.047 --> 00:25:32.349
He went to the trouble
of burying her.

199
00:25:32.351 --> 00:25:33.920
A sentimental skin-job.

200
00:25:36.622 --> 00:25:38.321
Sorry.

201
00:25:38.323 --> 00:25:40.191
So where's the kid?

202
00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.159
You scan the whole field?

203
00:25:43.161 --> 00:25:44.861
Just dirt and worms.

204
00:25:44.863 --> 00:25:46.129
No other bodies.

205
00:25:46.131 --> 00:25:47.700
Maybe he ate it.

206
00:26:36.815 --> 00:26:38.784
That's not possible.

207
00:26:41.119 --> 00:26:42.888
She was a Replicant.

208
00:26:45.723 --> 00:26:47.323
Pregnant.

209
00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:59.736
The world is built on a wall.

210
00:26:59.738 --> 00:27:01.239
It separates kind.

211
00:27:02.373 --> 00:27:04.440
Tell either side
there's no wall,

212
00:27:04.442 --> 00:27:06.709
you bought a war.

213
00:27:06.711 --> 00:27:08.079
Or a slaughter.

214
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:13.953
So, what you saw

215
00:27:16.087 --> 00:27:17.288
didn't happen.

216
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:21.157
Yes, madam.

217
00:27:21.159 --> 00:27:24.194
It is my job to keep order.

218
00:27:24.196 --> 00:27:27.099
That's what we do here.
We keep order.

219
00:27:28.933 --> 00:27:30.068
You want it gone?

220
00:27:32.069 --> 00:27:33.902
Erase everything.

221
00:27:33.904 --> 00:27:35.138
Even the child?

222
00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:36.342
All trace.

223
00:27:40.911 --> 00:27:42.981
You have anything more to say?

224
00:27:44.815 --> 00:27:47.719
I've never retired something
that was born before.

225
00:27:48.819 --> 00:27:50.255
What's the difference?

226
00:27:54.759 --> 00:27:57.028
To be born is to have a soul,
I guess.

227
00:27:58.196 --> 00:27:59.432
Are you telling me no?

228
00:28:01.098 --> 00:28:03.101
I wasn't aware
that was an option, madam.

229
00:28:03.768 --> 00:28:04.969
Attaboy.

230
00:28:08.172 --> 00:28:09.973
Hey.

231
00:28:09.975 --> 00:28:12.307
You've been getting on fine
without one.

232
00:28:12.309 --> 00:28:13.311
What's that, madam?

233
00:28:14.345 --> 00:28:15.748
A soul.

234
00:29:02.594 --> 00:29:07.298
<i>And you new models
are happy scraping the shit</i>

235
00:29:09.834 --> 00:29:12.203
<i>because you've never seen
a miracle.</i>

236
00:29:36.327 --> 00:29:38.998
Just checking in
on an old serial number.

237
00:29:43.934 --> 00:29:45.403
Confirmation DNA?

238
00:29:46.638 --> 00:29:48.140
I got hair.

239
00:30:05.489 --> 00:30:08.326
Oh! An old one.

240
00:30:09.527 --> 00:30:11.596
Pre-Blackout. Huh.

241
00:30:12.564 --> 00:30:14.400
That's gonna be tough.

242
00:30:15.667 --> 00:30:17.432
Not much from then.

243
00:30:17.434 --> 00:30:20.069
And what's there is

244
00:30:20.071 --> 00:30:22.537
thick milky.

245
00:30:22.539 --> 00:30:25.941
You can customize them
as much as you'd like.

246
00:30:25.943 --> 00:30:28.678
As human
as you want them to be.

247
00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.314
But your operation is strictly
a drill site, isn't it?

248
00:30:32.316 --> 00:30:34.383
I wouldn't waste your money
on intelligence,

249
00:30:34.385 --> 00:30:37.419
attachment or appeal.

250
00:30:37.421 --> 00:30:40.923
Unless you'd like to add some
pleasure models to your order.

251
00:30:54.439 --> 00:30:57.308
Would it be possible to
reschedule this call, please?

252
00:31:00.144 --> 00:31:01.444
Everyone remembers

253
00:31:01.446 --> 00:31:03.579
where they were
at the Blackout. You?

254
00:31:03.581 --> 00:31:05.415
That was a little
before my time.

255
00:31:05.417 --> 00:31:07.950
Mmm. I was home with my folks,

256
00:31:07.952 --> 00:31:11.353
then ten days of darkness.
Every machine stopped cold.

257
00:31:11.355 --> 00:31:14.023
When the lights came back,
we were wiped clean.

258
00:31:14.025 --> 00:31:17.592
Photos, files, every bit of
data... Ffft! Gone.

259
00:31:17.594 --> 00:31:19.495
Bank records, too.

260
00:31:19.497 --> 00:31:20.996
Didn't mind that.

261
00:31:20.998 --> 00:31:23.099
It's funny it's only paper
that lasted.

262
00:31:23.101 --> 00:31:24.400
I mean, we had
everything on drives.

263
00:31:24.402 --> 00:31:28.236
Everything, everything,
everything! Huh.

264
00:31:28.238 --> 00:31:31.440
My mom still cries
over the lost baby pictures.

265
00:31:31.442 --> 00:31:33.543
Well, it's a shame. You

266
00:31:33.545 --> 00:31:36.382
- must have been adorable.
- Hmm... Ah.

267
00:31:38.583 --> 00:31:41.150
Uh...

268
00:31:41.152 --> 00:31:44.687
Pretty fractured.
Not much on it.

269
00:31:44.689 --> 00:31:47.590
One of the last gens,
pre-Prohibition.

270
00:31:47.592 --> 00:31:51.159
Standard issue.
Made by Tyrell.

271
00:31:51.161 --> 00:31:52.163
And?

272
00:31:53.297 --> 00:31:55.098
Unremarkable.

273
00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:56.666
"Unremarkable"?

274
00:31:56.668 --> 00:31:59.138
There must be something
else we can find for him.

275
00:32:06.745 --> 00:32:09.548
Another prodigal
serial number returns.

276
00:32:11.082 --> 00:32:14.484
A 30-year-old open case
finally closed.

277
00:32:14.486 --> 00:32:16.121
Thank you, officer.

278
00:32:17.255 --> 00:32:19.258
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.
I'm Luv.

279
00:32:21.659 --> 00:32:23.161
He named you.

280
00:32:24.161 --> 00:32:26.496
Must be special.

281
00:32:26.498 --> 00:32:28.497
I'm here for Mr. Wallace.

282
00:32:28.499 --> 00:32:29.734
Follow me.

283
00:32:35.774 --> 00:32:38.978
The ancient models give the
entire endeavor a bad name.

284
00:32:40.644 --> 00:32:45.049
What a gift, don't you think,
from Mr. Wallace to the world?

285
00:32:48.452 --> 00:32:50.620
The outer colonies
would never have flourished

286
00:32:50.622 --> 00:32:52.354
had he not bought Tyrell,

287
00:32:52.356 --> 00:32:55.323
revivified the technology.

288
00:32:55.325 --> 00:32:57.429
To say the least
of what we do.

289
00:33:07.604 --> 00:33:10.073
I see you're also a customer.

290
00:33:10.075 --> 00:33:12.641
Are you satisfied
with our product?

291
00:33:12.643 --> 00:33:16.181
She's very realistic.
Thank you.

292
00:33:17.281 --> 00:33:19.849
Here. All the junk is in here.

293
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:22.787
Lucky for you,
Mr. Wallace is a data hoarder.

294
00:33:35.467 --> 00:33:37.436
No one's been
down here in ages.

295
00:33:40.572 --> 00:33:42.107
Sorry about that.

296
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:55.717
All our memory bearings
from the time.

297
00:33:55.719 --> 00:33:58.788
They were all damaged
in the Blackout.

298
00:33:58.790 --> 00:34:01.360
But there are
sometimes fragments.

299
00:34:17.341 --> 00:34:18.708
<i>You got a little boy.</i>

300
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:20.143
<i>He shows you
his butterfly collection,</i>

301
00:34:20.145 --> 00:34:21.377
<i>plus the killing jar.</i>

302
00:34:21.379 --> 00:34:23.478
<i>I'd take him
to the doctor.</i>

303
00:34:25.616 --> 00:34:27.350
<i>There's a wasp
crawling on your arm.</i>

304
00:34:27.352 --> 00:34:28.353
<i>I'd kill it.</i>

305
00:34:31.388 --> 00:34:33.156
<i>You're reading a magazine.</i>

306
00:34:33.158 --> 00:34:35.290
<i>You come across a full-page
nude photo of a girl.</i>

307
00:34:35.292 --> 00:34:37.225
<i>Is this testing
whether I'm a Replicant</i>

308
00:34:37.227 --> 00:34:38.761
<i>or a lesbian, Mr. Deckard?</i>

309
00:34:38.763 --> 00:34:40.596
<i>Just answer
the questions, please.</i>

310
00:34:44.401 --> 00:34:48.237
It was unclear what she was,
at least to someone.

311
00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:50.438
This was a test.

312
00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.477
We were difficult
to spot then.

313
00:34:54.344 --> 00:34:57.746
Was there anything unusual
about how you found her?

314
00:34:57.748 --> 00:35:00.285
To warrant an official
investigation?

315
00:35:02.687 --> 00:35:06.422
You know how people are
about old serial numbers.

316
00:35:06.424 --> 00:35:07.857
Everyone just sleeps better

317
00:35:07.859 --> 00:35:09.728
when they know
where they got to.

318
00:35:12.730 --> 00:35:14.366
She likes him.

319
00:35:15.567 --> 00:35:17.366
Who?

320
00:35:17.368 --> 00:35:19.605
This Officer Deckard.

321
00:35:20.805 --> 00:35:22.707
She's trying to provoke him.

322
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:29.280
It is invigorating being asked
personal questions.

323
00:35:29.913 --> 00:35:31.549
Makes one feel

324
00:35:32.817 --> 00:35:35.650
desired.

325
00:35:35.652 --> 00:35:37.855
Do you enjoy
your work, officer?

326
00:35:42.326 --> 00:35:44.328
Please thank Mr. Wallace
for your time.

327
00:35:56.908 --> 00:35:59.408
<i>You worked
with Officer Deckard</i>

328
00:35:59.410 --> 00:36:01.509
back in the day.

329
00:36:01.511 --> 00:36:03.879
What can you tell me
about him?

330
00:36:03.881 --> 00:36:05.884
He liked to work alone.

331
00:36:07.252 --> 00:36:08.654
So did I.

332
00:36:10.922 --> 00:36:14.259
So we worked together
to keep it that way.

333
00:36:15.426 --> 00:36:16.795
That was it.

334
00:36:17.895 --> 00:36:19.965
Anything else
you can tell me?

335
00:36:21.866 --> 00:36:24.436
He wasn't long for this world.

336
00:36:26.370 --> 00:36:27.372
How so?

337
00:36:30.341 --> 00:36:32.544
Something in his eyes.

338
00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.748
Any idea how I could
contact him?

339
00:36:38.582 --> 00:36:39.651
None.

340
00:36:41.486 --> 00:36:43.589
He's <i>nyugdíjas.</i>

341
00:36:46.758 --> 00:36:47.826
Retired.

342
00:36:49.794 --> 00:36:51.359
What happened?

343
00:36:51.361 --> 00:36:53.531
Probably got what he wanted.

344
00:36:55.966 --> 00:36:57.401
To be alone.

345
00:37:22.694 --> 00:37:23.862
Welcome back, sir.

346
00:37:25.997 --> 00:37:27.830
You wanted to review
the new model, sir,

347
00:37:27.832 --> 00:37:29.401
before shipment?

348
00:37:30.701 --> 00:37:33.002
An angel
should never enter

349
00:37:33.004 --> 00:37:35.638
the kingdom of heaven

350
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:37.009
without a gift.

351
00:37:39.743 --> 00:37:43.347
Can you at least pronounce,
"A child is born"?

352
00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:46.984
Hmm.

353
00:37:54.024 --> 00:37:55.793
A new model.

354
00:38:03.533 --> 00:38:05.903
Well, let us see her, then.

355
00:38:54.185 --> 00:38:57.022
The first thought

356
00:38:59.489 --> 00:39:01.625
one tends to fear,

357
00:39:02.794 --> 00:39:04.895
to preserve the clay.

358
00:39:07.497 --> 00:39:10.199
It's fascinating.

359
00:39:10.201 --> 00:39:13.004
Before we even know
what we are,

360
00:39:15.172 --> 00:39:17.109
we fear to lose it.

361
00:39:18.743 --> 00:39:20.842
Happy birthday.

362
00:39:29.921 --> 00:39:31.790
Now, let's have a look at you.

363
00:40:23.207 --> 00:40:25.609
We make angels

364
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:31.112
in the service
of civilization.

365
00:40:31.114 --> 00:40:34.183
Yes, there were
bad angels once.

366
00:40:34.185 --> 00:40:36.784
I make good angels now.

367
00:40:36.786 --> 00:40:41.560
That is how I took us
to nine new worlds.

368
00:40:43.928 --> 00:40:45.564
Nine.

369
00:40:47.031 --> 00:40:50.699
A child can count to nine
on fingers.

370
00:40:50.701 --> 00:40:53.636
We should own the stars.

371
00:40:53.638 --> 00:40:55.004
Yes, sir.

372
00:40:57.975 --> 00:40:59.975
Every leap
of civilization

373
00:40:59.977 --> 00:41:02.911
was built off the back
of a disposable workforce.

374
00:41:02.913 --> 00:41:06.281
We lost our stomach
for slaves

375
00:41:06.283 --> 00:41:08.185
unless engineered.

376
00:41:11.756 --> 00:41:13.959
But I can only make so many.

377
00:41:19.730 --> 00:41:21.700
That barren pasture,

378
00:41:22.832 --> 00:41:24.799
empty

379
00:41:24.801 --> 00:41:26.602
and salted...

380
00:41:28.004 --> 00:41:29.573
...right here.

381
00:41:31.609 --> 00:41:34.645
The dead space
between the stars.

382
00:41:36.881 --> 00:41:40.281
And this, the seat that
we must change for heaven.

383
00:41:45.089 --> 00:41:50.359
I cannot breed them.
So help me, I have tried.

384
00:41:50.361 --> 00:41:53.629
We need more Replicants
than can ever be assembled.

385
00:41:53.631 --> 00:41:57.301
Millions, so we can be
trillions more.

386
00:41:59.102 --> 00:42:02.273
We could storm Eden
and retake her.

387
00:42:14.384 --> 00:42:16.254
Tyrell's final trick:

388
00:42:17.388 --> 00:42:19.654
Procreation.

389
00:42:19.656 --> 00:42:22.760
Perfected, then lost.

390
00:42:24.027 --> 00:42:25.830
But there is a child.

391
00:42:29.065 --> 00:42:30.768
Bring it to me.

392
00:42:31.268 --> 00:42:32.671
Sir.

393
00:42:40.844 --> 00:42:43.047
The best angel of all.

394
00:42:44.681 --> 00:42:46.116
Aren't you, Luv?

395
00:44:04.027 --> 00:44:06.027
The man with the green jacket.

396
00:44:06.029 --> 00:44:09.667
The one who killed Sapper.
Find out what he knows.

397
00:44:28.886 --> 00:44:30.121
Hi.

398
00:44:31.321 --> 00:44:33.888
Hello, hello, A-Boy.

399
00:44:33.890 --> 00:44:35.324
You alone?

400
00:44:41.464 --> 00:44:43.434
It's okay.
It's fine.

401
00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.442
Wanna buy a lady a cigarette?

402
00:44:58.915 --> 00:45:00.184
Oh, you don't even smile.

403
00:45:03.319 --> 00:45:05.821
Didn't you hear your friends?

404
00:45:05.823 --> 00:45:07.890
Don't you know what I am?

405
00:45:07.892 --> 00:45:09.524
Yeah.

406
00:45:09.526 --> 00:45:11.462
Guy eating rice.

407
00:45:12.897 --> 00:45:14.199
What's that?

408
00:45:15.366 --> 00:45:17.332
It's a tree.

409
00:45:17.334 --> 00:45:20.404
Oh. Never seen a tree before.

410
00:45:22.038 --> 00:45:23.307
It's pretty.

411
00:45:25.442 --> 00:45:27.011
It's dead.

412
00:45:28.546 --> 00:45:32.884
Now, who keeps a dead tree?

413
00:45:35.553 --> 00:45:37.154
Hmm?

414
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:42.391
You're not gonna kill me,
are you?

415
00:45:42.393 --> 00:45:45.594
Depends.
What's your model number?

416
00:45:45.596 --> 00:45:48.062
Why don't you look under
my eye and find out.

417
00:45:50.935 --> 00:45:53.067
Oh!

418
00:45:53.069 --> 00:45:55.140
You don't like real girls.

419
00:45:58.241 --> 00:46:01.078
Well, I'm always here.

420
00:49:39.663 --> 00:49:40.698
Hi.

421
00:49:43.433 --> 00:49:45.333
You can't take those.

422
00:49:45.335 --> 00:49:48.536
Of course not. Proper channels
and paperwork. It's all here.

423
00:49:48.538 --> 00:49:51.138
Hold this for me.

424
00:49:51.140 --> 00:49:54.144
- Mmm. Yep. Here you go.
- Mmm.

425
00:50:11.227 --> 00:50:12.696
<i>Coco is dead.</i>

426
00:50:15.131 --> 00:50:17.466
Bones are gone.

427
00:50:17.468 --> 00:50:22.170
It's out. Already out.
How long'd that take?

428
00:50:22.172 --> 00:50:24.675
So, what do you have for me?
And don't say nothing.

429
00:50:25.875 --> 00:50:27.511
I found that.

430
00:50:28.344 --> 00:50:29.647
A sock?

431
00:50:31.747 --> 00:50:34.116
- Where'd you find it?
- Sapper's.

432
00:50:34.118 --> 00:50:35.649
Anything else?

433
00:50:35.651 --> 00:50:37.551
I burned everything else.

434
00:50:37.553 --> 00:50:38.886
Then what's this?
What's that date?

435
00:50:38.888 --> 00:50:41.223
Is that a birthday?
Is that a death day?

436
00:50:41.225 --> 00:50:42.460
I don't know yet.

437
00:50:46.430 --> 00:50:49.263
Am I the only one that can see
the fuckin' sunrise here?

438
00:50:49.265 --> 00:50:51.301
This breaks the world, "K."

439
00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.817
You know,
I've known a lot of your kind.

440
00:51:09.319 --> 00:51:14.589
All useful, but with you,
I sometimes forget.

441
00:51:14.591 --> 00:51:17.328
We didn't have any of you
where I was a kid.

442
00:51:22.899 --> 00:51:24.701
Do you remember anything?

443
00:51:26.270 --> 00:51:27.502
Before you were under me,

444
00:51:27.504 --> 00:51:29.703
you have any memories
from before?

445
00:51:29.705 --> 00:51:31.741
I have memories,

446
00:51:33.643 --> 00:51:36.247
but they're not real.
They're just implants.

447
00:51:37.413 --> 00:51:39.513
Tell me one.

448
00:51:39.515 --> 00:51:41.284
From when you were a kid.

449
00:51:45.721 --> 00:51:48.290
I feel a little strange
sharing a childhood story,

450
00:51:48.292 --> 00:51:49.794
considering
I was never a child.

451
00:51:52.529 --> 00:51:55.900
Well, would it help you share
if I told you it was an order?

452
00:51:58.669 --> 00:52:01.536
I have one
about a toy that I had.

453
00:52:01.538 --> 00:52:03.241
A wooden horse.

454
00:52:04.575 --> 00:52:06.676
With an inscription
underneath.

455
00:52:09.613 --> 00:52:11.478
All I remember
is a group of boys

456
00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.450
trying to take it away
from me.

457
00:52:13.917 --> 00:52:15.219
So I run.

458
00:52:40.676 --> 00:52:42.477
<i>I go looking for a place
to hide it,</i>

459
00:52:42.479 --> 00:52:44.482
<i>and the only place
is this dark furnace.</i>

460
00:52:46.649 --> 00:52:50.317
<i>It's very dark
and I'm very scared,</i>

461
00:52:50.319 --> 00:52:51.786
<i>but this horse is all I have,</i>

462
00:52:51.788 --> 00:52:53.558
<i>so I go in anyway.</i>

463
00:53:06.303 --> 00:53:07.935
<i>Later on, those kids find me,</i>

464
00:53:07.937 --> 00:53:11.274
<i>and they beat me to tell 'em
where it is, but I don't.</i>

465
00:53:17.814 --> 00:53:19.250
And that's it.

466
00:53:19.950 --> 00:53:21.882
Hmm.

467
00:53:21.884 --> 00:53:24.788
Little "K,"
fighting for what's his.

468
00:53:26.323 --> 00:53:27.725
It's a good one.

469
00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:35.332
Look at me.

470
00:53:38.368 --> 00:53:40.971
We're all just lookin' out
for somethin' real.

471
00:53:46.042 --> 00:53:48.445
What happens if I finish that?

472
00:53:52.082 --> 00:53:53.817
Shouldn't I get back
to work, madam?

473
00:54:03.926 --> 00:54:06.329
Check back in after DNAbase.

474
00:54:19.509 --> 00:54:22.409
<i>Officer KD6-3.7.</i>

475
00:54:24.881 --> 00:54:26.647
Request.

476
00:54:26.649 --> 00:54:30.551
DNA records:
children born 6-10-21.

477
00:54:30.553 --> 00:54:32.953
Looking for anomalies.

478
00:54:40.062 --> 00:54:41.995
You have
the satcrystal backup?

479
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:49.437
Okay.

480
00:54:49.439 --> 00:54:51.638
Run it raw.

481
00:55:27.777 --> 00:55:30.013
Mere data makes a man.

482
00:55:31.781 --> 00:55:34.681
A and C and T and G.

483
00:55:34.683 --> 00:55:38.622
The alphabet of you.
All from four symbols.

484
00:55:40.089 --> 00:55:41.658
I'm only two:

485
00:55:45.094 --> 00:55:46.995
1 and 0.

486
00:55:46.997 --> 00:55:50.567
Half as much but twice
as elegant, sweetheart.

487
00:55:51.667 --> 00:55:53.636
You don't prefer your madam?

488
00:55:54.471 --> 00:55:56.136
Mmm.

489
00:55:56.138 --> 00:55:57.874
You were listening.

490
00:55:58.774 --> 00:56:00.043
Maybe.

491
00:56:02.011 --> 00:56:05.679
You didn't like her enough
to tell her the truth.

492
00:56:05.681 --> 00:56:07.651
6, 10 and 21.

493
00:56:11.821 --> 00:56:14.087
There's nothin' to tell.

494
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:16.893
How many times
have you told me that story?

495
00:56:19.495 --> 00:56:20.698
Your memory?

496
00:56:22.232 --> 00:56:24.101
The date carved beneath.

497
00:56:24.868 --> 00:56:26.871
6, 10 and 21.

498
00:56:29.004 --> 00:56:30.540
Coincidence?

499
00:56:34.944 --> 00:56:37.414
A dangerous coincidence.

500
00:56:40.783 --> 00:56:43.119
I always knew
you were special.

501
00:56:44.721 --> 00:56:46.556
Maybe this is how.

502
00:56:51.727 --> 00:56:53.096
A child.

503
00:56:53.964 --> 00:56:56.000
Of woman born.

504
00:56:57.634 --> 00:56:59.603
Pushed into the world.

505
00:57:00.904 --> 00:57:02.106
Wanted.

506
00:57:03.806 --> 00:57:05.009
Loved.

507
00:57:08.078 --> 00:57:09.980
Well, if it were true,

508
00:57:11.547 --> 00:57:13.614
I'd be hunted
for the rest of my life

509
00:57:13.616 --> 00:57:15.486
by someone just like me.

510
00:57:17.053 --> 00:57:19.489
It's okay to dream a little.

511
00:57:20.022 --> 00:57:21.524
Isn't it?

512
00:57:22.125 --> 00:57:23.227
Not if you're us.

513
00:57:29.031 --> 00:57:31.165
Stop.

514
00:57:31.167 --> 00:57:34.969
Put up 4847
and 2181, side-by-side.

515
00:57:40.743 --> 00:57:43.611
They're identical. Translate.

516
00:57:46.850 --> 00:57:48.518
A boy and a girl.

517
00:57:50.219 --> 00:57:52.185
It's impossible.

518
00:57:52.187 --> 00:57:53.256
Why?

519
00:57:54.790 --> 00:57:57.760
Two people
can't have identical DNA.

520
00:57:59.062 --> 00:58:02.866
One of these isn't real.
It's a copy.

521
00:58:07.803 --> 00:58:10.773
They were both processed
at the Morrill Cole Orphanage.

522
00:58:13.109 --> 00:58:15.643
It says the girl died there.

523
00:58:15.645 --> 00:58:17.248
Genetic disorder.

524
00:58:18.582 --> 00:58:21.049
Galatians Syndrome.

525
00:58:21.051 --> 00:58:22.750
And the boy...

526
00:58:24.821 --> 00:58:26.190
...disappears.

527
00:58:28.625 --> 00:58:30.194
Where's the orphanage?

528
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:34.631
You wanna go for a ride?

529
00:59:50.739 --> 00:59:53.209
Well, here we are.

530
01:00:05.989 --> 01:00:07.257
Buckle up.

531
01:01:06.883 --> 01:01:07.884
"K"?

532
01:02:00.169 --> 01:02:03.504
"K"? "K"?

533
01:02:03.506 --> 01:02:06.910
"K"? "K"? "K"? "K"? "K"?

534
01:02:58.594 --> 01:03:00.361
Stay back.

535
01:03:15.277 --> 01:03:17.044
<i>Fire again.</i>

536
01:03:17.046 --> 01:03:18.248
<i>Fire again.</i>

537
01:03:20.315 --> 01:03:22.016
<i>Fire.</i>

538
01:03:32.995 --> 01:03:35.031
200 feet to the east.

539
01:03:37.165 --> 01:03:38.301
Fire.

540
01:03:40.402 --> 01:03:41.839
Go north.

541
01:03:44.073 --> 01:03:45.241
Fire.

542
01:03:46.308 --> 01:03:48.544
Stop. 20 degrees east.

543
01:03:51.114 --> 01:03:52.612
<i>Stop.</i>

544
01:03:52.614 --> 01:03:54.116
<i>Zoom in.</i>

545
01:03:55.551 --> 01:03:56.920
<i>Closer.</i>

546
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:02.158
Oh, come on.

547
01:04:03.459 --> 01:04:04.460
Get up.

548
01:04:05.361 --> 01:04:07.064
Do your fucking job.

549
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:10.099
Find the child.

550
01:04:46.234 --> 01:04:47.604
Watch the car.

551
01:06:26.569 --> 01:06:28.335
Every last piece,

552
01:06:28.337 --> 01:06:30.804
or I'll put you outside
where the sky is raining,

553
01:06:30.806 --> 01:06:33.140
where it's raining fire!

554
01:06:33.142 --> 01:06:34.808
You're in here to work.

555
01:06:34.810 --> 01:06:38.312
And if you're not working,
I don't need you.

556
01:06:38.314 --> 01:06:39.649
I don't need any of...

557
01:06:42.819 --> 01:06:44.054
Hi.

558
01:06:51.093 --> 01:06:53.828
The nickel
is for the colonial ships.

559
01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:56.763
Closest any of them
or any of us is gonna get

560
01:06:56.765 --> 01:06:59.668
to that grand life
off-world.

561
01:07:00.770 --> 01:07:02.502
And I encourage play, I do.

562
01:07:02.504 --> 01:07:06.306
Keeps 'em occupied and it
makes 'em nimble, right?

563
01:07:07.509 --> 01:07:09.743
But it's work.

564
01:07:09.745 --> 01:07:13.216
It's work that molds them
into a child worth havin'.

565
01:07:21.857 --> 01:07:23.359
So come on, now.

566
01:07:24.861 --> 01:07:26.594
What sort do you have in mind?

567
01:07:30.533 --> 01:07:34.134
'Cause I got all kinds.

568
01:07:36.205 --> 01:07:37.904
- Oh, no, no, no.
- I'm not buyin'.

569
01:07:37.906 --> 01:07:39.540
No, no, no.
This is just my game,

570
01:07:39.542 --> 01:07:41.308
and I play it fair.

571
01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:44.480
No. No, I mean,
bigger than you...

572
01:07:47.415 --> 01:07:49.149
Bigger than you
have tried to shut me down.

573
01:07:49.151 --> 01:07:51.652
Bigger than you.

574
01:07:51.654 --> 01:07:54.123
And they were men, at that.

575
01:07:55.725 --> 01:07:59.393
A little boy came through here
about 30 years back.

576
01:07:59.395 --> 01:08:02.495
- I need to see your records.
- Hmm.

577
01:08:02.497 --> 01:08:05.566
Legitimate placements,
private sales, everything.

578
01:08:05.568 --> 01:08:07.601
Don't keep records
that far back.

579
01:08:07.603 --> 01:08:09.306
- You don't?
- I don't.

580
01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:13.406
Sorry.

581
01:08:13.408 --> 01:08:14.810
Can't help you.

582
01:08:16.778 --> 01:08:19.782
- You can't?
- Nope.

583
01:08:24.653 --> 01:08:25.855
I think you can.

584
01:08:28.424 --> 01:08:31.691
I think someone like you
keeps a long memory.

585
01:08:31.693 --> 01:08:33.293
Now you can tell me
what you remember,

586
01:08:33.295 --> 01:08:35.865
or I can put a hole right here
and take a look.

587
01:08:49.778 --> 01:08:51.844
They were laughin'
and what was it you said?

588
01:08:51.846 --> 01:08:53.713
What did you say?

589
01:09:11.733 --> 01:09:13.236
Are you comin'?

590
01:09:24.246 --> 01:09:25.614
Where is it?

591
01:09:28.818 --> 01:09:30.253
Oh, God.

592
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:37.426
Where, where, where, where?

593
01:09:39.694 --> 01:09:41.931
I don't see it. Here.

594
01:09:50.672 --> 01:09:51.942
It's gone.

595
01:09:54.577 --> 01:09:56.947
It's the entire year.

596
01:09:58.848 --> 01:10:00.317
I didn't do that.

597
01:10:00.983 --> 01:10:02.485
That wasn't me.

598
01:10:06.022 --> 01:10:08.892
I didn't. Wasn't me.

599
01:14:43.299 --> 01:14:44.901
I always told you.

600
01:14:45.968 --> 01:14:47.504
You're special.

601
01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.609
Born.

602
01:14:53.309 --> 01:14:54.878
Not made.

603
01:14:58.714 --> 01:15:00.517
Hidden with care.

604
01:15:03.818 --> 01:15:05.821
A real boy now.

605
01:15:08.690 --> 01:15:11.094
A real boy needs a real name.

606
01:15:12.294 --> 01:15:13.662
Joe.

607
01:15:15.598 --> 01:15:17.097
"Joe"?

608
01:15:17.099 --> 01:15:20.167
You're too important for "K."

609
01:15:20.169 --> 01:15:22.538
Your mother
would've named you.

610
01:15:25.640 --> 01:15:27.274
Joe.

611
01:15:29.044 --> 01:15:30.947
- Joe.
- Stop.

612
01:15:37.819 --> 01:15:40.156
How do I know if a memory
is an implant or not?

613
01:15:44.693 --> 01:15:46.629
Who makes the memories?

614
01:16:18.093 --> 01:16:19.929
Dr. Ana Stelline?

615
01:16:23.866 --> 01:16:25.068
A visitor.

616
01:16:27.769 --> 01:16:29.171
Is that okay?

617
01:16:30.005 --> 01:16:31.007
Yes.

618
01:16:33.175 --> 01:16:35.044
It's just unusual.

619
01:16:36.412 --> 01:16:40.750
Nice to meet you,
Officer KD6-3.7.

620
01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:49.423
Sorry. It's a compromised
immune system.

621
01:16:49.425 --> 01:16:54.061
A life of freedom,
so long as it's behind glass.

622
01:16:54.063 --> 01:16:55.762
Is that why
you're not off-world?

623
01:16:55.764 --> 01:16:57.396
Yes.

624
01:16:57.398 --> 01:17:01.203
My parents had our passes
in pocket, but I took sick.

625
01:17:03.906 --> 01:17:06.940
So it was a new life for me.

626
01:17:06.942 --> 01:17:10.377
And they put me in my cage,

627
01:17:10.379 --> 01:17:13.780
filled it with everything
they could to keep me happy.

628
01:17:13.782 --> 01:17:18.187
Except company, of course.
And I was used to crowds.

629
01:17:21.724 --> 01:17:24.324
What can I help you with?

630
01:17:24.326 --> 01:17:28.261
Thought you might be able
to help me with a case.

631
01:17:28.263 --> 01:17:30.196
Oh, that's the most
interesting thing

632
01:17:30.198 --> 01:17:33.736
I've been offered
to help with in ages.

633
01:17:35.136 --> 01:17:38.273
Do you mind if I work
while you talk?

634
01:17:39.207 --> 01:17:40.343
Of course.

635
01:17:47.515 --> 01:17:50.053
I promise
I hear every word.

636
01:17:57.024 --> 01:18:00.060
They say you're the best
memory-maker there is.

637
01:18:00.062 --> 01:18:02.098
Well, then, they're kind.

638
01:18:03.264 --> 01:18:05.701
I love birthday parties.

639
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:11.437
You work for Wallace.

640
01:18:11.439 --> 01:18:15.374
Subcontract.
I'm one of his suppliers.

641
01:18:15.376 --> 01:18:16.942
He offered to buy me out,

642
01:18:16.944 --> 01:18:19.445
but I take my freedom
where I can find it.

643
01:18:20.948 --> 01:18:23.216
Why are you so good?

644
01:18:23.218 --> 01:18:26.186
What makes your memories
so authentic?

645
01:18:26.188 --> 01:18:29.325
Well, there's a bit of
every artist in their work.

646
01:18:30.858 --> 01:18:34.229
But I was locked
in a sterile chamber at 8,

647
01:18:35.464 --> 01:18:37.062
so if I wanted to see
the world,

648
01:18:37.064 --> 01:18:39.000
I had to imagine it.

649
01:18:40.469 --> 01:18:45.070
Got very good at imagining.

650
01:18:45.072 --> 01:18:48.043
Wallace needs my talent
to maintain a stable product.

651
01:18:49.978 --> 01:18:51.948
I think it's only kind.

652
01:18:53.581 --> 01:18:56.115
Replicants live
such hard lives,

653
01:18:56.117 --> 01:18:59.518
made to do
what we'd rather not.

654
01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.221
I can't help your future,

655
01:19:01.223 --> 01:19:02.388
but I can give you
good memories

656
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:05.294
to think back on and smile.

657
01:19:06.028 --> 01:19:07.459
It's nice.

658
01:19:07.461 --> 01:19:10.896
It's better than nice.
It feels authentic.

659
01:19:10.898 --> 01:19:12.265
And if you have
authentic memories,

660
01:19:12.267 --> 01:19:16.171
you have real human responses.

661
01:19:17.104 --> 01:19:18.974
Wouldn't you agree?

662
01:19:27.049 --> 01:19:29.348
Are they all constructed

663
01:19:29.350 --> 01:19:31.187
or do you ever use
ones that are real?

664
01:19:35.424 --> 01:19:38.294
It's illegal to use
real memories, officer.

665
01:19:40.461 --> 01:19:42.596
How can you tell
the difference?

666
01:19:42.598 --> 01:19:44.533
Can you tell if something

667
01:19:46.268 --> 01:19:47.370
really happened?

668
01:19:49.971 --> 01:19:53.006
They all think
it's about more detail.

669
01:19:53.008 --> 01:19:55.077
But that's not how
memory works.

670
01:19:56.144 --> 01:19:58.477
We recall with our feelings.

671
01:19:58.479 --> 01:20:01.850
Anything real
should be a mess.

672
01:20:03.417 --> 01:20:05.153
I can show you.

673
01:20:06.988 --> 01:20:08.023
Sit.

674
01:20:26.474 --> 01:20:31.945
Now, think about the memory
you want me to see.

675
01:20:31.947 --> 01:20:34.483
Not even that hard.
Just picture it.

676
01:20:35.349 --> 01:20:37.083
Let it play.

677
01:21:27.169 --> 01:21:29.104
Someone lived this, yes.

678
01:21:31.005 --> 01:21:32.407
This happened.

679
01:21:49.224 --> 01:21:50.927
I know it's real.

680
01:22:02.470 --> 01:22:04.572
I know it's real.

681
01:22:07.274 --> 01:22:10.442
God damn it!

682
01:22:54.822 --> 01:22:57.824
<i>Officer KD6-3.7.</i>

683
01:22:57.826 --> 01:22:59.426
<i>Madam is calling you in.</i>

684
01:22:59.428 --> 01:23:01.194
<i>You're under arrest.
Drop your gun</i>

685
01:23:01.196 --> 01:23:03.431
<i>and keep your hands
where I can see 'em.</i>

686
01:23:04.398 --> 01:23:05.698
<i>- Cells.</i>
- Cells.

687
01:23:05.700 --> 01:23:07.232
<i>Have you ever
been in an institution?</i>

688
01:23:07.234 --> 01:23:08.634
- <i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

689
01:23:08.636 --> 01:23:10.102
<i>When you're not
performing your duties,</i>

690
01:23:10.104 --> 01:23:11.603
<i>do they keep you
in a little box?</i>

691
01:23:11.605 --> 01:23:12.771
- <i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

692
01:23:12.773 --> 01:23:14.274
<i>- Interlinked.</i>
- Interlinked.

693
01:23:14.276 --> 01:23:15.542
<i>What's it like
to hold the hand</i>

694
01:23:15.544 --> 01:23:18.645
<i>of someone you love?
Interlinked.</i>

695
01:23:18.647 --> 01:23:19.846
Interlinked.

696
01:23:19.848 --> 01:23:21.080
<i>Within cells interlinked.</i>

697
01:23:21.082 --> 01:23:22.248
<i>Within cells interlinked.</i>

698
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:23.650
<i>- Dreadfully.
- Dreadfully.</i>

699
01:23:23.652 --> 01:23:25.351
<i>What's it like to
be filled with dread?</i>

700
01:23:25.353 --> 01:23:27.119
- <i>Dreadfully.</i>
- Dreadfully.

701
01:23:27.121 --> 01:23:28.288
<i>Do you like being
separated from other people?</i>

702
01:23:28.290 --> 01:23:29.722
- <i>Distinct.</i>

703
01:23:29.724 --> 01:23:31.490

<i>Within the cells

<i>- Within one stem.

708
01:23:37.765 --> 01:23:39.164
<i>And dreadfully distinct.</i>

709
01:23:39.166 --> 01:23:40.600
<i>And dreadfully distinct.</i>

710
01:23:40.602 --> 01:23:42.235
<i>- Against the dark.
- Against the dark.</i>

711
01:23:42.237 --> 01:23:43.357
<i>A tall white
fountain played.</i>

712
01:23:44.738 --> 01:23:46.442
A tall white
fountain played.

713
01:23:49.376 --> 01:23:51.546
<i>You're not even
close to baseline.</i>

714
01:23:57.519 --> 01:23:59.355
Out! Close the door.

715
01:24:00.354 --> 01:24:02.621
What the fuck is with you?

716
01:24:02.623 --> 01:24:04.757
I put you on a case.

717
01:24:04.759 --> 01:24:06.860
I impressed on you
the importance of that case,

718
01:24:06.862 --> 01:24:08.393
and then we pick you up

719
01:24:08.395 --> 01:24:10.765
fucking around
outside an upgrade center?

720
01:24:12.533 --> 01:24:14.901
Scan said you didn't look like
you on the inside.

721
01:24:14.903 --> 01:24:17.169
Miles off your baseline.

722
01:24:17.171 --> 01:24:18.670
Do you know what that means?

723
01:24:18.672 --> 01:24:20.276
I found the kid.

724
01:24:24.778 --> 01:24:26.646
He was set up
like a standard Replicant,

725
01:24:26.648 --> 01:24:28.084
put on a service job.

726
01:24:30.885 --> 01:24:33.154
Even he didn't know
who he was.

727
01:24:35.322 --> 01:24:36.856
- And?
- And it's done.

728
01:24:36.858 --> 01:24:38.158
What does that mean,
"it's done"?

729
01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:39.862
What you asked.

730
01:24:41.529 --> 01:24:42.797
It's done.

731
01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:48.136
Fuck.

732
01:24:50.738 --> 01:24:52.674
You just stopped a bomb
from goin' off.

733
01:24:54.675 --> 01:24:56.211
You did good.

734
01:24:58.712 --> 01:25:00.879
I can help you
get outta this station alive,

735
01:25:00.881 --> 01:25:03.783
but you have 48 hours
to get back on track.

736
01:25:03.785 --> 01:25:05.884
Surrender your gun and badge.

737
01:25:05.886 --> 01:25:09.125
And your next baseline test
is outta my hands.

738
01:25:10.892 --> 01:25:12.461
Thank you, madam.

739
01:25:44.559 --> 01:25:46.162
<i>You were right.</i>

740
01:25:52.867 --> 01:25:54.803
You were right
about everything.

741
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:57.672
Shh.

742
01:26:17.925 --> 01:26:19.394
Hmm.

743
01:26:23.631 --> 01:26:27.368
Thought you weren't
interested, worky man.

744
01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:32.241
You liked her. I could tell.

745
01:26:34.843 --> 01:26:35.911
It's okay.

746
01:26:37.412 --> 01:26:38.781
She's real.

747
01:26:40.982 --> 01:26:43.419
I wanna be real for you.

748
01:26:44.519 --> 01:26:46.388
You are real for me.

749
01:26:47.522 --> 01:26:48.957
You have a special lady here.

750
01:27:07.742 --> 01:27:08.777
Okay.

751
01:27:09.611 --> 01:27:10.845
Let's do it.

752
01:27:32.934 --> 01:27:34.700
Look at you.

753
01:27:34.702 --> 01:27:36.839
Quiet now,
I have to sync.

754
01:30:33.014 --> 01:30:36.752
<i>Joi is
anything you want her to be.</i>

755
01:30:38.252 --> 01:30:41.756
<i>Joi goes anywhere
you want her to go.</i>

756
01:31:11.318 --> 01:31:14.755
<i>99.9% detoxified water.</i>

757
01:31:44.852 --> 01:31:46.585
It's from a tree.

758
01:31:46.587 --> 01:31:47.989
I'm done with you.

759
01:31:48.956 --> 01:31:50.591
You can go now.

760
01:32:02.236 --> 01:32:04.270
Quiet, now.

761
01:32:04.272 --> 01:32:06.672
I've been inside you.

762
01:32:06.674 --> 01:32:08.944
Not so much there
as you think.

763
01:32:28.095 --> 01:32:29.661
Coffee?

764
01:32:35.336 --> 01:32:37.573
They'll be comin'
after me soon.

765
01:32:46.313 --> 01:32:48.881
I'm coming with you.

766
01:32:48.883 --> 01:32:51.182
But not like this.

767
01:32:51.184 --> 01:32:53.185
If they come here
looking for you,

768
01:32:53.187 --> 01:32:56.288
they'll have access
to all my memories.

769
01:32:56.290 --> 01:32:58.894
You have to delete me
from the console.

770
01:32:59.993 --> 01:33:01.630
My present.

771
01:33:03.665 --> 01:33:05.067
Put me there.

772
01:33:07.201 --> 01:33:08.870
I can't do that.

773
01:33:10.371 --> 01:33:12.937
Think about it.

774
01:33:12.939 --> 01:33:15.109
If anything happens to this,
that's it.

775
01:33:16.678 --> 01:33:17.778
You're gone.

776
01:33:18.246 --> 01:33:19.648
Yes.

777
01:33:20.982 --> 01:33:22.283
Like a real girl.

778
01:33:28.723 --> 01:33:29.992
Please.

779
01:33:33.193 --> 01:33:34.729
Joe, please.

780
01:33:36.130 --> 01:33:37.532
I want this.

781
01:33:41.402 --> 01:33:43.872
But I can't do it myself.

782
01:34:01.421 --> 01:34:02.957
<i>Break the antenna.</i>

783
01:34:43.464 --> 01:34:45.233
I don't need a real horse.

784
01:34:48.135 --> 01:34:50.969
I don't need a real horse.
I just...

785
01:34:50.971 --> 01:34:52.771
I just wanna find out
where it's from.

786
01:34:52.773 --> 01:34:54.140
Okay.

787
01:35:03.084 --> 01:35:05.787
Radiation from a reactor?

788
01:35:12.492 --> 01:35:14.095
It matches a dirty bomb.

789
01:35:22.502 --> 01:35:24.436
There's only one place
that dirty.

790
01:35:24.438 --> 01:35:25.873
Mmm-hmm.

791
01:35:26.808 --> 01:35:28.007
Nobody lives there.

792
01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:21.560
<i>Go to five.</i>

793
01:36:21.562 --> 01:36:23.398
<i>Four, 30 degrees to the left.</i>

794
01:36:26.300 --> 01:36:27.536
<i>Tilt up.</i>

795
01:36:30.403 --> 01:36:32.239
<i>Elevate to 400 feet.</i>

796
01:36:38.278 --> 01:36:40.147
<i>Radiation analysis.</i>

797
01:36:43.184 --> 01:36:44.386
<i>Move forward.</i>

798
01:36:51.459 --> 01:36:53.292
<i>Tilt up.</i>

799
01:36:53.294 --> 01:36:54.461
<i>Stop.</i>

800
01:36:56.630 --> 01:36:58.133
<i>Move forward.</i>

801
01:36:59.065 --> 01:37:00.602
<i>Go to five.</i>

802
01:37:01.568 --> 01:37:04.038
<i>Seven, move forward.</i>

803
01:37:08.943 --> 01:37:10.412
<i>Six.</i>

804
01:37:11.612 --> 01:37:12.881
<i>Stop.</i>

805
01:37:15.616 --> 01:37:17.682
<i>Go to seven.</i>

806
01:37:17.684 --> 01:37:19.286
<i>Eight.</i>

807
01:37:20.254 --> 01:37:21.622
<i>Nine.</i>

808
01:37:25.526 --> 01:37:27.127
Heat analysis.

809
01:37:35.169 --> 01:37:36.337
Life.

810
01:37:37.138 --> 01:37:39.304
What is it?

811
01:37:39.306 --> 01:37:41.276
Guess we're about to find out.

812
01:37:51.618 --> 01:37:53.354
Too dark in here.

813
01:37:56.357 --> 01:37:58.026
I like him.

814
01:37:58.725 --> 01:38:00.327
He's a good boy.

815
01:38:01.461 --> 01:38:03.063
Where is he?

816
01:38:09.437 --> 01:38:13.073
I have no idea. He's off-duty.

817
01:38:13.974 --> 01:38:15.341
Check around.

818
01:38:15.343 --> 01:38:16.644
I checked

819
01:38:18.045 --> 01:38:20.646
anywhere a good boy
might go.

820
01:38:20.648 --> 01:38:22.250
You're too late.

821
01:38:25.385 --> 01:38:26.955
It's gone.

822
01:38:30.157 --> 01:38:31.660
He destroyed it.

823
01:38:34.161 --> 01:38:36.628
Everything about it.

824
01:38:36.630 --> 01:38:38.230
Well, except
for the box of bones

825
01:38:38.232 --> 01:38:39.968
that you already took.

826
01:38:44.237 --> 01:38:49.007
Which, I'll wager,
wasn't enough. Here you are.

827
01:38:55.448 --> 01:38:57.318
You tiny thing.

828
01:38:59.185 --> 01:39:00.753
In the face
of the fabulous new,

829
01:39:00.755 --> 01:39:03.187
your only thought
is to kill it?

830
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:07.493
For fear of great change?

831
01:39:07.495 --> 01:39:11.163
You can't hold the tide
with a broom.

832
01:39:11.165 --> 01:39:13.068
Except that I did.

833
01:39:14.234 --> 01:39:15.700
Where is he?

834
01:39:19.607 --> 01:39:21.242
You're so sure.

835
01:39:22.643 --> 01:39:25.177
Because he told you.

836
01:39:25.179 --> 01:39:27.181
Because we never lie.

837
01:39:28.782 --> 01:39:31.719
I'm gonna tell Mr. Wallace
you tried to shoot me first.

838
01:39:32.819 --> 01:39:34.989
So I had to kill you.

839
01:39:39.393 --> 01:39:41.162
Then do what you gotta do.

840
01:39:42.595 --> 01:39:43.998
Madam.

841
01:40:16.464 --> 01:40:19.200
Location: Officer KD6-3.7.

842
01:45:07.587 --> 01:45:10.121
"Mightn't happen to have

843
01:45:10.123 --> 01:45:12.559
"a piece of cheese
about you, now?"

844
01:45:13.426 --> 01:45:14.862
Would you, boy?

845
01:45:29.876 --> 01:45:31.111
<i>Treasure Island?</i>

846
01:45:38.419 --> 01:45:39.787
He reads.

847
01:45:40.987 --> 01:45:42.489
That's good.

848
01:45:43.556 --> 01:45:46.024
Me, too.

849
01:45:46.026 --> 01:45:48.826
Not much else to do
around here at night anymore.

850
01:45:51.965 --> 01:45:56.604
"Many is the night
I dream of cheese,

851
01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:03.444
"toasted, mostly."

852
01:46:06.712 --> 01:46:08.549
What are you doing here?

853
01:46:11.652 --> 01:46:12.787
I heard the piano.

854
01:46:15.154 --> 01:46:16.690
Don't lie.

855
01:46:17.890 --> 01:46:19.126
It's rude.

856
01:46:21.562 --> 01:46:24.228
You're a cop.

857
01:46:24.230 --> 01:46:26.800
- I'm not here to take you in.
- Oh, yeah?

858
01:46:30.002 --> 01:46:31.072
Then, what?

859
01:46:33.739 --> 01:46:35.710
I just have some questions.

860
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:37.812
What questions?

861
01:46:55.828 --> 01:46:57.098
Stay.

862
01:49:30.817 --> 01:49:33.985
Look,
I don't wanna hurt you.

863
01:49:33.987 --> 01:49:35.723
But you're not makin' it easy.

864

868
01:50:25.237 --> 01:50:27.105
I like this song.

This is really somethin'.

876
01:51:05.312 --> 01:51:07.745
The whole town

877
01:51:07.747 --> 01:51:09.149
One time.

878
01:51:11.151 --> 01:51:12.987

01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:16.056
see a show,

880
01:51:17.823 --> 01:51:19.693
gamble a little.

881
01:51:22.129 --> 01:51:25.530
Win some money,
lose some money.

882
01:51:25.532 --> 01:51:29.267
They made money
seem like candy.

883
01:51:29.269 --> 01:51:31.401
You like whiskey?

884
01:51:31.403 --> 01:51:33.871
I've got millions

885
01:51:33.873 --> 01:51:35.910
of bottles of whiskey.

886
01:51:49.889 --> 01:51:50.890
Here.

887
01:51:52.259 --> 01:51:53.761
Bleeding.

888
01:52:06.305 --> 01:52:07.340
Is it real?

889
01:52:08.541 --> 01:52:10.208
I don't know.

890
01:52:10.210 --> 01:52:11.479
Ask him.

891
01:52:28.295 --> 01:52:29.363
Ya got a name?

892
01:52:31.864 --> 01:52:33.330
Officer KD6-3.7.

893
01:52:33.332 --> 01:52:36.202
That's not a name.
That's a serial number.

894
01:52:39.171 --> 01:52:40.473
All right.

895
01:52:43.175 --> 01:52:44.909
Joe.

896
01:52:44.911 --> 01:52:46.846
What do you want, Joe?

897
01:52:48.081 --> 01:52:49.513
I wanna ask you
some questions.

898
01:52:49.515 --> 01:52:50.917
Like what?

899
01:52:57.456 --> 01:53:01.327
Like what was her name,
the mother of your child?

900
01:53:08.367 --> 01:53:09.903
What was she like?

901
01:53:21.113 --> 01:53:25.482
- You two live here together?
- Too many questions.

902
01:53:25.484 --> 01:53:27.086
I had your job.
I was good at it.

903
01:53:28.054 --> 01:53:29.186
It was simpler then.

904
01:53:29.188 --> 01:53:30.487
Why you makin' it complicated?

905
01:53:30.489 --> 01:53:31.556
Why don't you just
answer the question.

906
01:53:31.558 --> 01:53:33.091
What question?

907
01:53:33.093 --> 01:53:35.395
I didn't figure you
as one for bullshit.

908
01:53:36.395 --> 01:53:37.898
What's her name?

909
01:53:51.443 --> 01:53:53.046
Rachael.

910
01:53:57.917 --> 01:54:00.019
Her name was Rachael.

911
01:54:03.924 --> 01:54:05.392
What happened to the kid?

912
01:54:08.627 --> 01:54:11.197
Who put it in the orphanage?
Was it you?

913
01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:15.568
I was long gone by then.

914
01:54:19.706 --> 01:54:21.175
You didn't even meet
your own kid?

915
01:54:24.611 --> 01:54:25.979
Why?

916
01:54:27.112 --> 01:54:28.615
Because that was the plan.

917
01:54:31.483 --> 01:54:33.718
I showed 'em
how to scramble the records,

918
01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:36.620
cover their tracks.

919
01:54:36.622 --> 01:54:41.025
Everyone had a part.
Mine was to leave.

920
01:54:41.027 --> 01:54:43.460
Then the Blackout came,
paved over everything.

921
01:54:43.462 --> 01:54:46.129
Couldn't have found the child
if I tried.

922
01:54:46.131 --> 01:54:49.499
- Did you want to?
- Not really.

923
01:54:49.501 --> 01:54:53.471
- Why not?
- Because we were being hunted.

924
01:54:53.473 --> 01:54:56.307
I didn't want
our child found,

925
01:54:56.309 --> 01:54:59.380
taken apart, dissected.

926
01:55:03.383 --> 01:55:06.153
Sometimes, to love someone,

927
01:55:08.354 --> 01:55:10.290
you gotta be a stranger.

928
01:55:31.443 --> 01:55:33.013
To strangers.

929
01:55:50.295 --> 01:55:53.066

940
01:57:44.844 --> 01:57:46.677
What'd you do?

941
01:57:46.679 --> 01:57:48.315
Who'd you bring? Huh?

942
01:57:50.250 --> 01:57:51.582
No one.

943
01:57:51.584 --> 01:57:52.653
Oh, yeah?

944
01:57:58.291 --> 01:57:59.560
<i>Target locked.</i>

945
01:58:02.194 --> 01:58:03.263
They know you're here.

946
01:58:05.197 --> 01:58:06.532
I came alone.

947
02:00:13.792 --> 02:00:14.861
Bad dog.

948
02:00:32.711 --> 02:00:33.879
Stop.

949
02:00:50.095 --> 02:00:53.463
I do hope you're satisfied
with our product.

950
02:00:53.465 --> 02:00:54.901
I love yo...

951
02:04:08.827 --> 02:04:12.998
Hey, there's someone
who wants to meet you.

952
02:04:14.767 --> 02:04:16.001
You can trust us.

953
02:04:24.609 --> 02:04:27.480
You must want me to look up
and to the left.

954
02:04:33.152 --> 02:04:35.619
This is Freysa.

955
02:04:35.621 --> 02:04:37.855
She fought with Sapper
on Calantha.

956
02:04:37.857 --> 02:04:39.759
I recognize you.

957
02:04:41.693 --> 02:04:43.696
Did you help him
hide the child?

958
02:04:44.095 --> 02:04:45.862
Oh.

959
02:04:45.864 --> 02:04:47.867
I was there.

960
02:04:51.237 --> 02:04:54.737
I saw a miracle delivered.

961
02:04:54.739 --> 02:04:58.642
A perfect little face
crying up at me.

962
02:04:58.644 --> 02:05:00.614
Mad as thunder.

963
02:05:13.858 --> 02:05:15.694
Were you with her?

964
02:05:17.330 --> 02:05:18.995
Rachael?

965
02:05:18.997 --> 02:05:21.100
I held her
as she died.

966
02:05:22.702 --> 02:05:27.605
We hid the child and made
a vow to keep our secret.

967
02:05:27.607 --> 02:05:31.208
That's why Sapper
let you kill him.

968
02:05:31.210 --> 02:05:36.683
I knew that baby meant
we are more than just slaves.

969
02:05:38.317 --> 02:05:41.218
If a baby can come
from one of us,

970
02:05:41.220 --> 02:05:44.722
we are our own masters.

971
02:05:44.724 --> 02:05:46.960
More human than humans.

972
02:05:49.060 --> 02:05:51.294
A revolution is coming.

973
02:05:51.296 --> 02:05:53.732
And we're building an army.

974
02:05:54.867 --> 02:05:56.770
I want to free our people.

975
02:06:05.243 --> 02:06:06.979
If you want to be free,

976
02:06:07.779 --> 02:06:09.114
join us.

977
02:06:14.286 --> 02:06:17.320
Deckard, Sapper, you, me,

978
02:06:17.322 --> 02:06:22.026
our lives mean nothing
next to a storm that's coming.

979
02:06:22.028 --> 02:06:24.061
Dying for the right cause

980
02:06:24.063 --> 02:06:26.633
is the most human thing
we can do.

981
02:06:29.300 --> 02:06:32.201
You led Wallace to Deckard.

982
02:06:32.203 --> 02:06:36.807
You cannot allow Deckard
to lead Wallace to me.

983
02:06:36.809 --> 02:06:38.678
You must kill Deckard.

984
02:06:48.086 --> 02:06:51.789
Deckard only wanted
his baby to be safe.

985
02:06:51.791 --> 02:06:52.792
And she is.

986
02:06:55.394 --> 02:06:57.093
When the time comes,

987
02:06:57.095 --> 02:06:59.128
I will show her
to the world,

988
02:06:59.130 --> 02:07:01.231
and she will lead our army.

989
02:07:01.233 --> 02:07:02.966
"She"?

990
02:07:02.968 --> 02:07:05.002
Of course.

991
02:07:05.004 --> 02:07:06.906
Rachael had a daughter.

992
02:07:08.239 --> 02:07:11.277
With my own eyes,
I saw her come.

993
02:07:12.211 --> 02:07:13.843
I dressed her in blue

994
02:07:13.845 --> 02:07:15.279
when it was time
for her to go.

995
02:07:15.281 --> 02:07:17.183
It was a boy that you hid.

996
02:07:19.452 --> 02:07:22.389
That is just a piece
of the puzzle.

997
02:07:39.438 --> 02:07:41.908
You imagined it was you?

998
02:07:43.442 --> 02:07:45.209
Oh.

999
02:07:45.211 --> 02:07:46.379
You did.

1000
02:07:47.278 --> 02:07:48.415
You did.

1001
02:07:51.416 --> 02:07:53.886
We all wish it was us.

1002
02:07:55.254 --> 02:07:57.122
That's why we believe.

1003
02:08:13.773 --> 02:08:15.475
<i>Someone lived this, yes.</i>

1004
02:08:18.042 --> 02:08:20.811
<i>I showed 'em
how to scramble the records,</i>

1005
02:08:20.813 --> 02:08:22.812
<i>cover their tracks.</i>

1006
02:08:22.814 --> 02:08:26.950
<i>With my own eyes,
I saw her come.</i>

1007
02:08:26.952 --> 02:08:31.288
<i>I dressed her in blue when
it was time for her to go.</i>

1008
02:08:31.290 --> 02:08:33.727
<i>There's a bit
of every artist in their work.</i>

1009
02:09:12.130 --> 02:09:15.298
Always jumping,
that one.

1010
02:09:15.300 --> 02:09:19.503
Never a thought of what to do
if it made land.

1011
02:09:19.505 --> 02:09:24.310
All the courage in the world
cannot alter fact.

1012
02:09:29.014 --> 02:09:33.553
I have wanted to meet you
for so very long.

1013
02:09:52.604 --> 02:09:55.508
You are a wonder to me,
Mr. Deckard.

1014
02:10:01.145 --> 02:10:02.549
I had the lock.

1015
02:10:04.550 --> 02:10:06.519
I found the key.

1016
02:10:08.153 --> 02:10:12.959
Yet the pins do not align.
The door remains locked.

1017
02:10:15.294 --> 02:10:18.898
I need the specimen
to reach it, Mr. Deckard.

1018
02:10:22.501 --> 02:10:23.937
The child.

1019
02:10:25.403 --> 02:10:26.906
I need the child.

1020
02:10:28.439 --> 02:10:31.009
To teach them all to fly.

1021
02:10:39.417 --> 02:10:43.255
"And God remembered Rachel,

1022
02:10:45.323 --> 02:10:48.928
"heeded her
and opened her womb."

1023
02:10:50.496 --> 02:10:52.398
<i>Do you like our owl?</i>

1024
02:10:55.099 --> 02:10:56.535
<i>It's artificial?</i>

1025
02:10:57.702 --> 02:10:59.371
<i>Of course it is.</i>

1026
02:11:01.172 --> 02:11:02.642
<i>Must be expensive.</i>

1027
02:11:04.576 --> 02:11:07.212
<i>Very. I'm Rachael.</i>

1028
02:11:08.313 --> 02:11:09.514
<i>Deckard.</i>

1029
02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:23.395
Is it the same

1030
02:11:24.662 --> 02:11:27.332
now, as then,

1031
02:11:30.001 --> 02:11:31.571
the moment you met her?

1032
02:11:41.980 --> 02:11:45.115
<i>All these years
you looked back on that day,</i>

1033
02:11:45.117 --> 02:11:48.388
<i>drunk on the memory
of its perfection.</i>

1034
02:11:51.556 --> 02:11:54.057
How shiny her lips.

1035
02:11:54.059 --> 02:11:56.462
How instant your connection.

1036
02:11:59.732 --> 02:12:01.530
Did it never occur to you

1037
02:12:01.532 --> 02:12:04.370
that's why you were summoned
in the first place?

1038
02:12:06.170 --> 02:12:08.704
Designed to do nothing short
of fall for her

1039
02:12:08.706 --> 02:12:11.544
right then and there.

1040
02:12:13.778 --> 02:12:19.218
All to make
that single perfect specimen.

1041
02:12:22.554 --> 02:12:25.524
That is, if you were designed.

1042
02:12:27.026 --> 02:12:28.624
Love

1043
02:12:28.626 --> 02:12:31.263
or mathematical precision.

1044
02:12:37.102 --> 02:12:38.237
Yes.

1045
02:12:39.371 --> 02:12:40.506
No.

1046
02:12:45.376 --> 02:12:47.647
I know what's real.

1047
02:13:11.437 --> 02:13:13.169
It was very clever
to keep yourself

1048
02:13:13.171 --> 02:13:14.838
empty of information,

1049
02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:18.478
and all it cost you
was everything.

1050
02:13:22.547 --> 02:13:24.349
But you can still help me.

1051
02:13:26.285 --> 02:13:29.488
You had help in the hiding.

1052
02:13:31.790 --> 02:13:33.626
Where did they go?

1053
02:13:35.461 --> 02:13:37.296
I know you know something.

1054
02:13:38.496 --> 02:13:40.830
Help me,

1055
02:13:40.832 --> 02:13:44.536
and very, very good things
can come to you.

1056
02:13:50.274 --> 02:13:52.478
You don't have children,

1057
02:13:55.680 --> 02:13:56.681
do you?

1058
02:13:57.582 --> 02:14:00.152
Oh, I have millions.

1059
02:14:02.386 --> 02:14:05.789
You think I have
nothing to offer but pain.

1060
02:14:05.791 --> 02:14:07.727
Only I know

1061
02:14:08.861 --> 02:14:10.529
you love pain.

1062
02:14:11.897 --> 02:14:16.501
Pain reminds you
the joy you felt was real.

1063
02:14:18.470 --> 02:14:20.306
More joy, then.

1064
02:14:26.577 --> 02:14:28.380
Do not be afraid.

1065
02:14:43.461 --> 02:14:44.830
An angel

1066
02:14:46.230 --> 02:14:47.366
made again.

1067
02:14:51.803 --> 02:14:53.206
For you.

1068
02:15:27.538 --> 02:15:29.474
Did you miss me?

1069
02:15:47.358 --> 02:15:48.693
Don't you love me?

1070
02:16:07.912 --> 02:16:09.314
Her eyes were green.

1071
02:16:27.332 --> 02:16:29.665
Off-world,

1072
02:16:29.667 --> 02:16:32.604
I have everything I need
to make you talk.

1073
02:16:34.739 --> 02:16:37.309
You do not know
what pain is yet.

1074
02:16:38.910 --> 02:16:40.680
You will learn.

1075
02:16:52.758 --> 02:16:54.726
<i>Hello, handsome.</i>

1076
02:17:11.610 --> 02:17:13.913
<i>What a day, hmm?</i>

1077
02:17:17.816 --> 02:17:19.485
<i>You look lonely.</i>

1078
02:17:20.752 --> 02:17:22.655
<i>I can fix that.</i>

1079
02:17:26.057 --> 02:17:28.693
<i>You look like a good Joe.</i>

1080
02:18:04.396 --> 02:18:07.364
<i>Dying for the right cause</i>

1081
02:18:07.366 --> 02:18:09.567
<i>is the most human thing
we can do.</i>

1082
02:18:12.503 --> 02:18:14.939
Because you've never seen
a miracle.

1083
02:18:53.545 --> 02:18:54.944
<i>You're entering</i>

1084
02:18:54.946 --> 02:18:56.579
<i>Los Angeles Airport
restricted airspace.</i>

1085
02:18:56.581 --> 02:18:58.414
<i>Confirm your identity.</i>

1086
02:18:58.416 --> 02:19:02.419
Transport S-14-4-XD.
Confirmed.

1087
02:19:02.421 --> 02:19:07.022
<i>Base, this is
06 outbound departure...</i>

1088
02:19:07.024 --> 02:19:08.727
Where are we going?

1089
02:19:09.827 --> 02:19:11.029
Home.

1090
02:20:06.485 --> 02:20:08.117
<i>Drive two down.</i>

1091

<i>Backup engaged.</i>

1092
02:20:11.255 --> 02:20:12.822
<i>Warning.</i>

1093
02:20:12.824 --> 02:20:15.090
- Can we make it?
- We're too low.

1094

Take us back.

1095
02:21:05.877 --> 02:21:06.879

1101
02:27:17.482 --> 02:27:19.618
You shoulda let me
die out there.

1102

You did.

1103
02:27:26.190 --> 02:27:27.926
You drowned out there.

1104
02:27:33.564 --> 02:27:35.300
You're free to meet
your daughter now.

1105
02:29:01.184 --> 02:29:03.387
All the best memories
are hers.

1106
02:29:12.663 --> 02:29:13.966
Why?

1107
02:29:16.634 --> 02:29:18.370
Who am I to you?

1108
02:29:27.779 --> 02:29:29.681
Go meet your daughter.

1109
02:29:35.719 --> 02:29:37.254
You okay?

1110
02:32:13.577 --> 02:32:15.180
Just a moment.

1111
02:32:17.614 --> 02:32:19.151
Beautiful, isn't it?
