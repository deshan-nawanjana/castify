00:01:32.541 --> 00:01:33.941
<i>I used to think</i>

3
00:01:33.943 --> 00:01:36.711
<i>this was the beginning
of your story.</i>

4
00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:45.820
<i>Memory is a strange thing.</i>

5
00:01:47.055 --> 00:01:50.391
<i>It doesn't work
like I thought it did.</i>

6
00:01:50.393 --> 00:01:55.096
<i>We are so bound by time,
by its order.</i>

7
00:02:16.518 --> 00:02:17.585
Okay.

8
00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:26.427
Okay. Come back to me.

9
00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.062
Come back to me.

10
00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:31.065
Come back to me.

11
00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:32.833
Stick 'em up!

12
00:02:34.003 --> 00:02:37.505
Are you the sheriff
in this here town?

13
00:02:37.507 --> 00:02:40.741
These are my tickle guns,
and I'm gonna getcha!

14
00:02:40.743 --> 00:02:42.476
No!

15
00:02:42.478 --> 00:02:46.013
You want me to chase you?
You better run!

16
00:02:47.816 --> 00:02:50.551
Ah!
Oh!

17
00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.735
<i>I remember
moments in the middle.</i>

18
00:03:10.806 --> 00:03:12.773
I love you.

19
00:03:13.708 --> 00:03:15.042
I hate you!

20
00:03:27.123 --> 00:03:29.089
<i>And this was the end.</i>

21
00:03:30.827 --> 00:03:31.692
Shhh...

22
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.934
Come back to me.

23
00:03:39.936 --> 00:03:41.802
You come back to me.

24
00:03:57.152 --> 00:03:58.686
<i>But now I'm not so sure</i>

25
00:03:58.688 --> 00:04:00.888
<i>I believe in beginnings
and endings.</i>

26
00:04:01.756 --> 00:04:06.026
<i>There are days that define
your story beyond your life.</i>

27
00:04:07.662 --> 00:04:09.763
<i>Like the day they arrived.</i>

28
00:04:21.176 --> 00:04:22.676
Good morning.

29
00:04:22.678 --> 00:04:23.544
Morning.

30
00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:28.983
Where is everyone?

31
00:04:30.519 --> 00:04:32.753
Okay. Well,
let's get started.

32
00:04:32.755 --> 00:04:35.656
Today we are talking
about Portuguese

33
00:04:35.658 --> 00:04:37.758
and why it sounds
so different

34
00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.060
from the other
romance languages.

35
00:04:40.062 --> 00:04:44.598
The story of Portuguese begins
in the kingdom of galicia...

36
00:04:46.068 --> 00:04:47.601
Sorry.

37
00:04:47.603 --> 00:04:49.870
...in the middle ages,

38
00:04:49.872 --> 00:04:53.641
where language was seen
as an expression of art.

39
00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.883
Any news
you want to share?

40
00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:06.220
Dr. banks, can you turn
the TV to a news channel?

41
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:25.706
<i>...but police have
already set up a blockade</i>

42
00:05:25.708 --> 00:05:26.974
<i>here around the area.</i>

43
00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:28.276
<i>As you can see,</i>

44
00:05:28.376 --> 00:05:29.944
<i>we've got just about
as close as we can,</i>

45
00:05:29.949 --> 00:05:30.546
<i>but unfortunately,</i>

46
00:05:30.746 --> 00:05:34.114
<i>Montana right now
is on complete lockdown.</i>

47
00:05:34.116 --> 00:05:37.251
<i>The object apparently
touched down 40 minutes ago,</i>

48
00:05:37.253 --> 00:05:39.186
<i>just north of i-94.</i>

49
00:05:39.188 --> 00:05:41.789
<i>We're waiting to hear
if this is perhaps</i>

50
00:05:41.791 --> 00:05:44.592
<i>an experimental vessel or...</i>

51
00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.727
<i>Hold on, it...</i>

52
00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:50.764
<i>I'm learning that more objects
like this have landed in</i>

53
00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:52.800
<i>as many as
eight other locations</i>

54
00:05:52.802 --> 00:05:54.868
<i>around the world.</i>

55
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.737
<i>Yes, can we?</i>

56
00:05:56.739 --> 00:06:00.007
<i>This is from
a site in hokkaido.</i>

57
00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.744
<i>This is worldwide.
It is happening right now.</i>

58
00:06:09.684 --> 00:06:11.652
Okay. Um...

59
00:06:12.721 --> 00:06:14.622
I'm sorry.
Class is dismissed.

60
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:57.731
You are an idiot!
You drove right into me!

61
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:02.202
You just ruined my car!

62
00:07:02.204 --> 00:07:05.072
<i>For now, we're simply
asking for cooperation</i>

63
00:07:05.074 --> 00:07:07.207
<i>while authorities
assess the object.</i>

64
00:07:07.209 --> 00:07:09.810
<i>So,
you're saying it's not ours?</i>

65
00:07:09.812 --> 00:07:11.278
<i>Do you even know
if it's from earth?</i>

66
00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.813
<i>We're still collecting
information.</i>

67
00:07:12.815 --> 00:07:14.081
<i>We're coordinating
with other countries.</i>

68
00:07:14.083 --> 00:07:16.016
<i>We're not the only ones to</i>

69
00:07:16.018 --> 00:07:18.218
<i>have one of these
in our backyard.</i>

70
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.321
<i>If this is some sort
of peaceful first contact,</i>

71
00:07:21.323 --> 00:07:23.057
<i>why send 12?</i>

72
00:07:23.059 --> 00:07:24.858
<i>Why not just one?</i>

73
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:37.438
Yeah, I know.
I saw that, too.

74
00:07:40.375 --> 00:07:42.409
Uh-huh.

75
00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:49.316
Uh-huh. I don't know, mom.

76
00:07:49.318 --> 00:07:52.119
I'm watching the same
news coverage you are.

77
00:07:55.056 --> 00:07:59.226
Well, mom, please don't
bother with that channel.

78
00:07:59.228 --> 00:08:01.795
How many times
do I have to tell you?

79
00:08:01.797 --> 00:08:03.163
Those people are idiots.

80
00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.801
Yeah, well,
do I sound nervous?

81
00:08:08.737 --> 00:08:10.471
Okay. Exactly. So...

82
00:08:11.873 --> 00:08:14.274
Um, me? Yeah, um,
you know me.

83
00:08:14.276 --> 00:08:16.210
I'm about the same.

84
00:08:20.215 --> 00:08:22.349
Mom, I'm fine.

85
00:08:23.284 --> 00:08:26.086
Okay, I'll call you later.
Bye.

86
00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:37.765
<i>And around eight
hours after landing,</i>

87
00:08:37.767 --> 00:08:39.900
<i>there are still no signs
of what might be called</i>

88
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:40.902
<i>"first contact."</i>

89
00:08:41.002 --> 00:08:45.038
<i>Now, the objects measure
at least 1,500 feet tall...</i>

90
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.775
<i>Two are reported to have
penetrated Russian airspace.</i>

91
00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:51.178
<i>One in Siberia, and the other
off the coast of the black...</i>

92
00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.013
<i>...above the ocean.</i>

93
00:08:53.015 --> 00:08:55.382
<i>So far, there are
12 unidentified objects</i>

94
00:08:55.389 --> 00:08:56.584
<i>spread across the globe.</i>

95
00:08:56.684 --> 00:08:59.453
<i>There is no obvious logic
to their locations</i>

96
00:08:59.455 --> 00:09:02.256
<i>and no evidence that
the ships are even occu...</i>

97
00:09:02.258 --> 00:09:05.926
<i>...entertain the idea that
if it is a kind of vessel,</i>

98
00:09:05.928 --> 00:09:08.328
<i>it may be unmanned.</i>

99
00:09:08.330 --> 00:09:11.398
<i>Regardless, we have a protocol
for scenarios like this.</i>

100
00:10:20.001 --> 00:10:22.135
<i>After Tuesday's
extraordinary events,</i>

101
00:10:22.137 --> 00:10:25.239
<i>the president this morning has
declared a state of emergency,</i>

102
00:10:25.241 --> 00:10:27.140
<i>with as many as
5,000 national guard</i>

103
00:10:27.142 --> 00:10:29.376
<i>being deployed to
the state of Montana alone.</i>

104
00:10:29.378 --> 00:10:32.012
<i>Borders are closed and
flights have been grounded,</i>

105
00:10:32.014 --> 00:10:33.981
<i>stranding millions
of travelers.</i>

106
00:10:33.983 --> 00:10:36.283
<i>Panic buying of gas,
water and food</i>

107
00:10:36.285 --> 00:10:38.151
<i>continues to escalate,</i>

108
00:10:38.153 --> 00:10:40.020
<i>and federal authorities
have temporarily lifted</i>

109
00:10:40.022 --> 00:10:43.090
<i>all caps on overtime
for law enforcement.</i>

110
00:10:43.092 --> 00:10:46.026
<i>The atf has put a temporary
ban on new gun licenses,</i>

111
00:10:46.028 --> 00:10:48.161
<i>forcing many
independent suppliers of</i>

112
00:10:48.163 --> 00:10:50.230
<i>hunting equipment and firearms</i>

113
00:10:50.232 --> 00:10:52.232
<i>to close their doors
to the public.</i>

114
00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:54.568
<i>Forty-eight hours later
and no further development...</i>

115
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:56.003
Two days...

116
00:10:56.005 --> 00:10:58.071
<i>...from the site of
the 12 ufos.</i>

117
00:10:58.073 --> 00:10:59.439
...and already,
the public expects us

118
00:10:59.441 --> 00:11:01.375
to know the answers.

119
00:11:01.377 --> 00:11:03.377
I'm colonel g.T. Weber.

120
00:11:05.178 --> 00:11:06.179
We never formally met,

121
00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:08.181
but two years ago, you did
some Farsi translations

122
00:11:08.183 --> 00:11:09.583
for army intelligence.

123
00:11:09.589 --> 00:11:10.385
Oh.

124
00:11:10.585 --> 00:11:13.520
You made quick work
of those insurgent videos.

125
00:11:13.522 --> 00:11:15.956
You made quick work
of those insurgents.

126
00:11:18.126 --> 00:11:21.161
You are on the top of
everyone's list

127
00:11:21.163 --> 00:11:23.463
when it comes
to translations.

128
00:11:23.465 --> 00:11:27.334
And you have another
two years in your ssbi,

129
00:11:27.336 --> 00:11:29.469
so you still have
top-secret clearance.

130
00:11:29.471 --> 00:11:32.940
That's why I'm in your
office and not at Berkeley.

131
00:11:34.075 --> 00:11:35.409
Okay.

132
00:11:43.584 --> 00:11:46.219
I have something I need you
to translate for me.

133
00:11:54.462 --> 00:11:56.563
<i>Why are you here?</i>

134
00:11:59.367 --> 00:12:02.135
<i>Can you...
Can you understand us?</i>

135
00:12:09.377 --> 00:12:11.044
<i>Where did you come from?</i>

136
00:12:19.454 --> 00:12:23.457
Now you heard it.
What do you make of it?

137
00:12:26.627 --> 00:12:28.395
Is that...

138
00:12:28.397 --> 00:12:30.130
Yes.

139
00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:34.134
How many?

140
00:12:34.136 --> 00:12:36.536
How many what?

141
00:12:36.538 --> 00:12:39.272
Um, how many, um, speaking?

142
00:12:42.076 --> 00:12:43.543
Two.

143
00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:48.415
Assume they were not
speaking at the same time.

144
00:12:48.417 --> 00:12:51.618
Are you sure?
Did they have mouths...

145
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:55.222
How would you approach
translating this?

146
00:12:56.024 --> 00:12:59.226
Do you hear any words?
Phrases?

147
00:13:01.162 --> 00:13:04.297
I don't...
I don't know.

148
00:13:04.299 --> 00:13:06.166
So what can you tell me?

149
00:13:06.168 --> 00:13:08.402
I can tell you that
it's impossible

150
00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:10.437
to translate
from an audio file.

151
00:13:10.439 --> 00:13:13.573
I would need to be there,
to interact with them.

152
00:13:13.575 --> 00:13:16.576
You didn't need that
with the Farsi translations.

153
00:13:16.578 --> 00:13:19.513
I didn't need it because
i already knew the language,

154
00:13:19.515 --> 00:13:21.648
but this...
This is... ah...

155
00:13:24.652 --> 00:13:26.086
I know what you're doing.

156
00:13:26.088 --> 00:13:27.287
Tell me what I'm doing.

157
00:13:27.387 --> 00:13:28.589
I'm not taking you
to Montana.

158
00:13:28.689 --> 00:13:31.124
It's all I can do to keep it
from turning into a tourist site

159
00:13:31.126 --> 00:13:32.426
for everybody who
has a ts clearance.

160
00:13:32.428 --> 00:13:34.461
I'm just telling you
what it would take

161
00:13:34.463 --> 00:13:36.063
to do this job.

162
00:13:36.065 --> 00:13:37.531
This is not
a negotiation.

163
00:13:37.533 --> 00:13:41.334
If I leave here,
your chance is gone.

164
00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.078
Good day.

165
00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:52.813
Colonel?

166
00:13:54.582 --> 00:13:56.149
You mentioned Berkeley.

167
00:13:56.151 --> 00:13:58.485
Are you going to
ask danvers next?

168
00:13:58.487 --> 00:13:59.753
Maybe.

169
00:13:59.755 --> 00:14:02.355
Before you commit to him,

170
00:14:02.357 --> 00:14:06.159
ask him the sanskrit word
for war and its translation.

171
00:14:14.169 --> 00:14:16.436
<i>An agreement on sharing
scientific discoveries</i>

172
00:14:16.438 --> 00:14:18.205
<i>looks closer tonight,</i>

173
00:14:18.207 --> 00:14:20.774
<i>as Russia and China join talks
at the united nations.</i>

174
00:14:20.776 --> 00:14:24.377
<i>Meanwhile, financial markets
across the world are in crisis</i>

175
00:14:24.379 --> 00:14:26.613
<i>as the dow Jones
industrial average fell</i>

176
00:14:26.615 --> 00:14:28.348
<i>over 2,000 points...</i>

177
00:14:46.267 --> 00:14:47.200
Morning.

178
00:14:47.202 --> 00:14:48.301
Colonel?

179
00:14:48.803 --> 00:14:50.403
<i>Gavisti.</i>

180
00:14:50.405 --> 00:14:52.405
He says it means
"an argument."

181
00:14:52.407 --> 00:14:54.141
What do you say
it means?

182
00:14:54.143 --> 00:14:55.609
A desire for more cows.

183
00:14:55.611 --> 00:14:57.310
Pack your bags.

184
00:14:58.679 --> 00:15:00.380
All right.
Give me 20 minutes?

185
00:15:00.382 --> 00:15:01.748
Takeoff in ten.

186
00:15:03.317 --> 00:15:04.684
Dr. banks.
Right this way, please.

187
00:15:19.433 --> 00:15:22.502
<i>Contact and
ready to approach...</i>

188
00:15:22.504 --> 00:15:25.172
Excuse me, Dr. banks, let me make
sure you're properly secured.

189
00:15:33.314 --> 00:15:34.581
You okay?

190
00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:18.625
<i>Sorry, I couldn't hear
what you were saying.</i>

191
00:16:18.627 --> 00:16:21.628
<i>"Language is the foundation
of civilization.</i>

192
00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.231
<i>"It is the glue that
holds a people together.</i>

193
00:16:24.233 --> 00:16:26.967
<i>"It is the first weapon
drawn in a conflict."</i>

194
00:16:28.302 --> 00:16:30.237
<i>Louise,
this is Ian Donnelly.</i>

195
00:16:30.239 --> 00:16:31.771
<i>Louise banks,
Ian Donnelly.</i>

196
00:16:31.773 --> 00:16:33.440
<i>That's quite a greeting.</i>

197
00:16:33.442 --> 00:16:35.442
<i>Yeah, well, you wrote it.</i>

198
00:16:35.444 --> 00:16:37.377
<i>Yeah.</i>

199
00:16:37.379 --> 00:16:39.613
<i>It's the kind of thing
you write as a preface.</i>

200
00:16:39.615 --> 00:16:41.715
<i>Dazzle them with the basics.</i>

201
00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:44.851
<i>Yeah, it's great.
Even if it's wrong.</i>

202
00:16:44.853 --> 00:16:47.354
<i>It's wrong?</i>

203
00:16:47.356 --> 00:16:49.656
<i>Well, the cornerstone of
civilization isn't language,</i>

204
00:16:49.658 --> 00:16:51.258
<i>it's science.</i>

205
00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.794
<i>Ian is a theoretical
physicist from los Alamos.</i>

206
00:16:55.796 --> 00:16:57.931
<i>You'll be reporting to me,
but you'll be working with him</i>

207
00:16:57.933 --> 00:16:59.532
<i>when you're in the shell.</i>

208
00:16:59.766 --> 00:17:01.167
<i>That's what
they're calling the ufo.</i>

209
00:17:01.168 --> 00:17:05.338
<i>Priority one: What do they
want and where are they from?</i>

210
00:17:05.539 --> 00:17:07.807
<i>And beyond that,
how did they get here?</i>

211
00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:10.510
<i>Are they capable of
faster-than-light travel?</i>

212
00:17:10.512 --> 00:17:13.947
<i>I've prepared a list of
questions to go over,</i>

213
00:17:13.949 --> 00:17:15.415
<i>starting with a series of</i>

214
00:17:15.417 --> 00:17:17.384
<i>"handshake"
binary sequences...</i>

215
00:17:17.386 --> 00:17:18.885
<i>How about
we just talk to them</i>

216
00:17:18.887 --> 00:17:21.454
<i>before we start throwing
math problems at them?</i>

217
00:17:23.624 --> 00:17:25.759
<i>This is why
you're both here.</i>

218
00:17:27.695 --> 00:17:29.462
<i>I'll bring
the coffee.</i>

219
00:17:31.565 --> 00:17:33.667
<i>Coffee with some aliens.</i>

220
00:19:43.564 --> 00:19:46.032
I want you to take
these two to Dr. kettler.

221
00:19:46.034 --> 00:19:47.934
Yes, sir.

222
00:19:47.936 --> 00:19:49.636
Follow the captain
to medical.

223
00:19:49.638 --> 00:19:51.438
It should take
just a few minutes,

224
00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.606
and then
we'll get started.

225
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:07.854
We'll take care of your bag.
I'll take your cell phones.

226
00:20:07.856 --> 00:20:09.823
Cell phones!

227
00:20:10.958 --> 00:20:12.859
Follow me.

228
00:20:12.861 --> 00:20:15.728
Put these on. You're gonna
wear them at all times.

229
00:20:28.576 --> 00:20:29.976
Sir, they're here.

230
00:20:30.744 --> 00:20:32.645
Louise banks?
Ian Donnelly?

231
00:20:32.947 --> 00:20:34.547
When was the last time
either of you have eaten?

232
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:35.882
Last night.
Same.

233
00:20:35.884 --> 00:20:37.784
Last time you did
something stressful?

234
00:20:37.786 --> 00:20:39.619
Does now count?

235
00:20:40.955 --> 00:20:42.489
Just saying...

236
00:20:42.491 --> 00:20:45.191
Uh, who was being carted off
in the medevac?

237
00:20:45.193 --> 00:20:48.828
Not everyone is able to
process experiences like this.

238
00:20:48.830 --> 00:20:50.830
I'm gonna get
some blood from you

239
00:20:50.832 --> 00:20:52.599
and give you
an immunization dose

240
00:20:52.601 --> 00:20:54.801
that covers a battery
of bacterial threats.

241
00:20:54.803 --> 00:20:57.937
Could you sign these, please?
And roll up your sleeves.

242
00:20:57.939 --> 00:20:59.506
Either of you
claustrophobic?

243
00:20:59.508 --> 00:21:00.907
No.
No.

244
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:03.610
Currently taking any medications?
Allergies?

245
00:21:03.612 --> 00:21:05.044
Pregnant?

246
00:21:05.046 --> 00:21:06.679
No.

247
00:21:06.681 --> 00:21:08.815
The booster is
a kick to your system,

248
00:21:08.817 --> 00:21:11.017
so you may experience
some side effects,

249
00:21:11.019 --> 00:21:12.752
nausea, dizziness,
headaches,

250
00:21:12.754 --> 00:21:15.522
a ringing in your ears,
like you have tinnitus.

251
00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:17.590
They wouldn't go,
either way.

252
00:21:26.902 --> 00:21:28.801
You see
what's happening to him?

253
00:21:28.901 --> 00:21:30.003
How does this even work?

254
00:21:30.103 --> 00:21:31.538
<i>The readings do not change,</i>

255
00:21:31.638 --> 00:21:32.540
<i>but I don't know,</i>

256
00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.008
<i>it's like we're insects
on a piece of paper,</i>

257
00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.176
<i>and they're easing us
out of the house.</i>

258
00:21:37.178 --> 00:21:40.013
<i>At exactly 112 minutes
and 19 seconds,</i>

259
00:21:40.015 --> 00:21:43.683
<i>gravity starts to shift
and slides us out of the room.</i>

260
00:21:43.685 --> 00:21:46.653
Have you found a scientific
explanation for it?

261
00:21:46.655 --> 00:21:48.054
Like,
is it for them?

262
00:21:48.056 --> 00:21:50.023
<i>Uh, no.
We think it's for us.</i>

263
00:21:50.025 --> 00:21:52.859
<i>Air doesn't seem to circulate
inside the chamber,</i>

264
00:21:52.861 --> 00:21:55.662
<i>so after about two hours,
we run out of oxygen.</i>

265
00:21:55.664 --> 00:21:59.165
It doesn't take 18 hours to
pump fresh air into a room.

266
00:21:59.167 --> 00:22:00.867
Atmosphere...

267
00:22:02.670 --> 00:22:03.970
Excuse me?

268
00:22:03.972 --> 00:22:06.139
If their atmosphere is
different from earth,

269
00:22:06.141 --> 00:22:07.707
it would certainly take hours

270
00:22:07.709 --> 00:22:09.976
to rebalance their O2 content
and pressure for us

271
00:22:09.978 --> 00:22:11.978
every time
they open their door.

272
00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.614
So, they could suffocate us
if they wanted.

273
00:22:14.616 --> 00:22:16.749
This is agent halpern
with the CIA.

274
00:22:16.751 --> 00:22:18.851
Let me get you two
to your stations.

275
00:22:18.853 --> 00:22:20.153
Yes, sir.

276
00:22:20.155 --> 00:22:22.989
Remember, we need answers
as soon as possible.

277
00:22:22.991 --> 00:22:24.857
What do they want?
Where are they from?

278
00:22:24.859 --> 00:22:26.192
Why are they here?

279
00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:27.660
This is the priority.

280
00:22:27.662 --> 00:22:29.662
Everyone, this is
Dr. Ian Donnelly.

281
00:22:29.664 --> 00:22:31.264
He'll be running
this team here.

282
00:22:31.266 --> 00:22:33.633
Have they responded
to anything?

283
00:22:33.635 --> 00:22:36.169
Shapes, patterns,
numbers, fibonacci?

284
00:22:36.171 --> 00:22:37.604
We can't tell
what they're saying

285
00:22:37.606 --> 00:22:39.639
when they respond
to "hello," so...

286
00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:42.208
Don't get ahead of yourself.

287
00:22:44.745 --> 00:22:46.079
What have you figured out?

288
00:22:46.081 --> 00:22:49.182
We're just getting started.
Good morning!

289
00:22:49.184 --> 00:22:52.185
This is Dr. Louise banks.
She'll be heading your team.

290
00:22:52.585 --> 00:22:53.787
It's a pleasure
meeting you.

291
00:22:53.987 --> 00:22:56.322
Dr. banks is taking over the
mission from Dr. Walker.

292
00:22:57.959 --> 00:23:00.760
That's a 15-minute warning.

293
00:23:00.762 --> 00:23:02.362
You scuba-dive before?

294
00:23:05.299 --> 00:23:07.934
What kind of radiation
exposure are we walking into?

295
00:23:07.936 --> 00:23:10.236
Nominal. These are
just for safety.

296
00:23:10.238 --> 00:23:13.039
So, is there any physical
contact with the, um...

297
00:23:13.041 --> 00:23:15.908
Am I the only one having
trouble saying "aliens"?

298
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.844
There's a wall.
Like, a glass wall.

299
00:23:17.846 --> 00:23:19.646
You can't
get to them.

300
00:23:20.848 --> 00:23:23.683
So, what do
they look like?

301
00:23:23.685 --> 00:23:25.852
You'll see soon enough.
Hurry up.

302
00:23:44.672 --> 00:23:47.340
<i>The suits are clumsy at first,</i>

303
00:23:47.342 --> 00:23:49.809
<i>but you get used to them.</i>

304
00:23:50.979 --> 00:23:52.912
<i>I'll open a second vehicle.</i>

305
00:24:00.354 --> 00:24:02.255
<i>We'll be there
in a few minutes.</i>

306
00:24:02.257 --> 00:24:04.424
<i>Make sure you hold on
to something.</i>

307
00:25:00.748 --> 00:25:04.250
<i>Copy, condor. We will observe,
but not initiate. Over.</i>

308
00:25:04.752 --> 00:25:06.419
Watch your step.

309
00:25:07.421 --> 00:25:09.422
<i>We'll keep
Alpha channel open. Over.</i>

310
00:25:09.424 --> 00:25:12.158
<i>Alpha, be advised.
Humidity increased since yesterday.</i>

311
00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.193
<i>Every 18 hours,</i>

312
00:25:14.195 --> 00:25:16.429
<i>the door opens up
at the bottom.</i>

313
00:25:18.966 --> 00:25:20.833
<i>That's where we go in.</i>

314
00:25:30.177 --> 00:25:30.965
<i>Zero movement.</i>

315
00:25:31.165 --> 00:25:33.246
<i>Alpha detail, clear
to proceed. Over.</i>

316
00:25:33.446 --> 00:25:34.447
<i>Copy, condor.</i>

317
00:25:34.448 --> 00:25:36.482
<i>Beginning our ascent now.
Over.</i>

318
00:25:41.922 --> 00:25:43.990
<i>Ten feet.</i>

319
00:25:47.494 --> 00:25:49.395
<i>Five feet.</i>

320
00:25:50.831 --> 00:25:53.132
<i>Two, one...</i>

321
00:26:10.851 --> 00:26:13.286
<i>Alpha clear to enter
antechamber.</i>

322
00:26:21.996 --> 00:26:23.963
<i>Moving into position.</i>

323
00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:34.841
<i>Thirty feet from target.</i>

324
00:26:34.842 --> 00:26:39.111
<i>Suit telemetry now full strength,
despite unknown interference.</i>

325
00:26:47.254 --> 00:26:49.989
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

326
00:27:11.311 --> 00:27:14.113
<i>Oxygen level: 20.3%.</i>

327
00:27:14.115 --> 00:27:16.616
<i>No known contaminates. Over.</i>

328
00:27:29.396 --> 00:27:31.564
<i>Radio signals are decreasing.</i>

329
00:27:31.566 --> 00:27:34.600
<i>90%, 85%...</i>

330
00:27:53.186 --> 00:27:55.288
Yeah, that just happened.

331
00:28:15.475 --> 00:28:16.943
<i>All right,
let's move!</i>

332
00:28:16.945 --> 00:28:18.144
<i>Time is wasting.</i>

333
00:28:18.946 --> 00:28:21.280
<i>You ready? You ready?</i>

334
00:28:22.249 --> 00:28:24.116
<i>Let's do it!</i>

335
00:28:24.118 --> 00:28:27.286
<i>Condor, I'm proceeding first
with captain marks, over.</i>

336
00:28:34.061 --> 00:28:37.129
<i>Gravity nominal
in the antechamber. Over!</i>

337
00:28:37.131 --> 00:28:39.332
<i>It's all good, sir.</i>

338
00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:41.133
<i>You can proceed.</i>

339
00:28:41.135 --> 00:28:43.569
<i>Stand by!
Okay, bring it up.</i>

340
00:28:49.141 --> 00:28:50.142
<i>Vitals are low.</i>

341
00:28:50.143 --> 00:28:53.446
<i>Radio signal strength
stable at 75%. Over.</i>

342
00:28:55.082 --> 00:28:57.049
You okay?

343
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:01.020
Yeah.

344
00:29:02.022 --> 00:29:03.589
Dr. banks?

345
00:29:07.427 --> 00:29:10.529
<i>You can do this. Come on.</i>

346
00:29:10.531 --> 00:29:12.398
<i>I don't know. I... I think...</i>

347
00:29:21.141 --> 00:29:22.742
<i>Grab her.</i>

348
00:29:35.188 --> 00:29:37.256
<i>Donnelly,
are you all right?</i>

349
00:29:38.458 --> 00:29:40.526
Dr. Donnelly, you good?

350
00:29:42.195 --> 00:29:44.463
<i>Dr. Donnelly,
are you all right?</i>

351
00:29:44.465 --> 00:29:46.532
<i>Please respond. Over.</i>

352
00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:48.267
<i>Yeah.</i>

353
00:29:51.204 --> 00:29:53.272
<i>Holy fuck!</i>

354
00:29:58.078 --> 00:29:59.412
<i>We're gonna
go down there,</i>

355
00:29:59.414 --> 00:30:02.281
<i>and you're gonna
start your job.</i>

356
00:30:02.283 --> 00:30:04.083
<i>Okay.
Okay?</i>

357
00:30:04.085 --> 00:30:05.284
<i>Okay.</i>

358
00:30:05.384 --> 00:30:06.486
<i>Everybody, move out!</i>

359
00:30:06.686 --> 00:30:08.220
<i>Alpha detail is in position.</i>

360
00:30:08.222 --> 00:30:09.755
<i>Team is in position.</i>

361
00:30:09.757 --> 00:30:11.424
<i>We're on the move.</i>

362
00:30:57.137 --> 00:30:59.338
<i>Condor, Alpha's now
in the nave.</i>

363
00:30:59.639 --> 00:31:02.174
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

364
00:31:34.674 --> 00:31:37.643
So, what happens now?

365
00:31:40.413 --> 00:31:42.214
They arrive.

366
00:32:45.745 --> 00:32:47.479
<i>Dr. banks?</i>

367
00:32:52.419 --> 00:32:54.553
Dr. banks?

368
00:32:55.555 --> 00:32:57.423
You can start.

369
00:33:02.229 --> 00:33:03.929
<i>...in airlock.</i>

370
00:33:03.931 --> 00:33:06.765
<i>Do not stop until you have
passed the airlock door.</i>

371
00:33:06.767 --> 00:33:08.801
<i>Do not attempt to
remove Hazmat suits</i>

372
00:33:08.803 --> 00:33:11.770
<i>without assistance
from authorized personnel.</i>

373
00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:13.439
<i>Repeat: Hazmat suits</i>

374
00:33:13.441 --> 00:33:16.442
<i>without assistance
from authorized personnel.</i>

375
00:33:16.444 --> 00:33:18.377
Wait. Just a minute.
Just a minute.

376
00:33:31.423 --> 00:33:32.424
Clear.

377
00:33:32.425 --> 00:33:33.659
- All right.
- Step on out, please.

378
00:33:33.827 --> 00:33:34.893
Now hold that.

379
00:33:37.931 --> 00:33:39.698
Am I fired?

380
00:33:39.933 --> 00:33:42.534
You're better
than the last guy.

381
00:33:42.536 --> 00:33:45.004
That doesn't
make me feel any better.

382
00:33:46.606 --> 00:33:49.808
You both have till 02:00 hours
to figure something out.

383
00:33:49.810 --> 00:33:52.411
Okay. What happens then?

384
00:33:52.413 --> 00:33:54.380
You go back in.

385
00:34:27.847 --> 00:34:30.015
<i>Violence continues to spread</i>

386
00:34:30.017 --> 00:34:32.985
<i>across the us today in
the wake of the 12 landings.</i>

387
00:34:32.987 --> 00:34:34.453
<i>The president has declared</i>

388
00:34:34.455 --> 00:34:36.455
<i>a mandatory
dusk-to-dawn curfew</i>

389
00:34:36.457 --> 00:34:38.624
<i>after the crackdown
by the national guard failed</i>

390
00:34:38.626 --> 00:34:41.493
<i>to prevent a third night of
looting across the country.</i>

391
00:34:41.495 --> 00:34:44.530
<i>In north Dakota,
144 members of</i>

392
00:34:44.532 --> 00:34:46.365
<i>the Saint Lawrence
pentecostal cult</i>

393
00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:49.368
<i>are feared dead after they set
their compound ablaze.</i>

394
00:34:49.370 --> 00:34:51.770
<i>Their website claims
the arrival of the aliens</i>

395
00:34:51.772 --> 00:34:53.605
<i>set in motion
a prophesy that...</i>

396
00:35:13.493 --> 00:35:16.528
Uh, we're up in 15.
You got any new intel?

397
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:20.632
<i>Yeah, we've been playing back
some of their sounds.</i>

398
00:35:20.634 --> 00:35:22.368
Where does that get you?

399
00:35:22.370 --> 00:35:23.969
<i>Well, they play audio
back at us,</i>

400
00:35:23.971 --> 00:35:26.372
<i>from an unseen source.</i>

401
00:35:26.374 --> 00:35:27.806
Audio of what?

402
00:35:27.808 --> 00:35:30.042
<i>Uh, it's bits of conversation
from the room.</i>

403
00:35:30.044 --> 00:35:32.010
<i>Random clips of dialogue.</i>

404
00:35:32.846 --> 00:35:35.481
<i>Really, we have nothing.</i>

405
00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:40.386
<i>T-minus 14 minutes
to shell access.</i>

406
00:35:40.388 --> 00:35:42.388
<i>T-minus 14 minutes
to shell access.</i>

407
00:36:04.544 --> 00:36:07.413
<i>T-minus 9 minutes
to shell access.</i>

408
00:36:07.415 --> 00:36:10.482
<i>T-minus 9 minutes
to shell access.</i>

409
00:36:10.484 --> 00:36:11.950
<i>What's that for?</i>

410
00:36:11.952 --> 00:36:13.952
<i>A visual aid.</i>

411
00:36:13.954 --> 00:36:16.789
<i>Look, I'm never gonna be
able to speak their words,</i>

412
00:36:16.889 --> 00:36:18.091
<i>if they are talking,</i>

413
00:36:18.291 --> 00:36:21.427
<i>but they might have some
sort of written language</i>

414
00:36:21.429 --> 00:36:23.429
<i>or basis for
visual communication.</i>

415
00:36:23.431 --> 00:36:25.864
<i>Okay.
Let's get started.</i>

416
00:36:35.942 --> 00:36:37.209
<i>Human.</i>

417
00:37:05.038 --> 00:37:06.705
<i>"Human."</i>

418
00:37:09.876 --> 00:37:13.912
<i>I'm human. What are you?</i>

419
00:37:25.124 --> 00:37:26.825
<i>Human.</i>

420
00:38:17.044 --> 00:38:18.243
<i>Oh my god!</i>

421
00:38:18.343 --> 00:38:19.545
<i>Are you getting this?</i>

422
00:38:19.745 --> 00:38:22.014
<i>Yes, sir!
It's uploading back to base camp.</i>

423
00:38:23.550 --> 00:38:26.818
<i>Louise,
that's incredible.</i>

424
00:38:41.067 --> 00:38:43.135
<i>Human.</i>

425
00:38:44.203 --> 00:38:46.271
<i>Human.</i>

426
00:38:46.273 --> 00:38:48.206
<i>Human.</i>

427
00:38:59.118 --> 00:39:02.721
<i>Okay, slow down now.</i>

428
00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:04.990
<i>Slow down.</i>

429
00:39:22.141 --> 00:39:24.610
<i>I don't wanna take away
from your success in there,</i>

430
00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:27.045
<i>but Dr. banks,
is this really the right approach?</i>

431
00:39:27.047 --> 00:39:30.315
<i>Trying to teach them
how to speak and read?</i>

432
00:39:30.317 --> 00:39:32.250
<i>That's gotta take longer.</i>

433
00:39:32.252 --> 00:39:35.721
<i>You're wrong. It's faster.</i>

434
00:39:37.724 --> 00:39:41.760
Everything you do in there, i have
to explain to a room full of men

435
00:39:41.762 --> 00:39:43.662
whose first
and last question is...

436
00:39:43.664 --> 00:39:45.764
"How can this
be used against us?"

437
00:39:45.766 --> 00:39:48.400
So you're gonna have to
give me more than that.

438
00:39:49.902 --> 00:39:51.670
Kangaroo.

439
00:39:52.639 --> 00:39:53.905
What is that?

440
00:39:53.907 --> 00:39:55.807
In 1770,

441
00:39:55.809 --> 00:39:57.309
captain James cook's ship
ran aground

442
00:39:57.311 --> 00:39:58.777
off the coast of Australia,

443
00:39:58.779 --> 00:40:00.646
and he led a party
into the country,

444
00:40:00.648 --> 00:40:02.214
and they met
the aboriginal people.

445
00:40:02.216 --> 00:40:03.915
One of the sailors
pointed at

446
00:40:03.917 --> 00:40:05.784
the animals
that hop around

447
00:40:05.786 --> 00:40:07.819
and put their babies
in their pouch,

448
00:40:07.821 --> 00:40:09.187
and he asked
what they were,

449
00:40:09.189 --> 00:40:11.390
and the aborigine said,
"kangaroo."

450
00:40:13.158 --> 00:40:14.159
And the point is?

451
00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.294
It wasn't till later
that they learned that

452
00:40:16.296 --> 00:40:19.131
"kangaroo" means
"i don't understand." So,

453
00:40:19.298 --> 00:40:22.300
I need this so that we don't
misinterpret things in there.

454
00:40:22.302 --> 00:40:25.003
Otherwise, this is gonna
take 10 times as long.

455
00:40:26.873 --> 00:40:28.140
I can sell that
for now.

456
00:40:29.776 --> 00:40:31.677
But I need you to submit
your vocabulary words

457
00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.045
before the next session.

458
00:40:33.047 --> 00:40:34.680
Fair.

459
00:40:34.682 --> 00:40:37.215
And remember what happened
to the aborigines.

460
00:40:37.217 --> 00:40:41.153
A more advanced race
nearly wiped them out.

461
00:40:48.362 --> 00:40:49.995
It's a good story.

462
00:40:49.997 --> 00:40:51.396
Thanks.

463
00:40:52.331 --> 00:40:54.066
It's not true.

464
00:40:54.068 --> 00:40:56.201
But it proves my point.

465
00:41:13.252 --> 00:41:15.320
<i>We think
we were able to reproduce</i>

466
00:41:15.322 --> 00:41:18.190
<i>some prime number
sequences back at them.</i>

467
00:41:18.192 --> 00:41:19.891
<i>So that's something.</i>

468
00:41:19.893 --> 00:41:22.227
Well, congratulations.
You're a parrot.

469
00:41:22.229 --> 00:41:23.929
<i>It's a lot more than that,
you cheeky bastard,</i>

470
00:41:23.931 --> 00:41:25.097
<i>don't you see?</i>

471
00:41:25.099 --> 00:41:27.132
<i>They can't seem to
follow our algebra,</i>

472
00:41:27.734 --> 00:41:31.103
<i>but complex behaviors,
that clicks.</i>

473
00:41:34.273 --> 00:41:38.009
Well that doesn't make
any sense at all, does it?

474
00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:44.049
Problem is,
not everyone shares our policy

475
00:41:44.051 --> 00:41:46.118
of being open
with the aliens.

476
00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.153
Have you met
general shang?

477
00:41:48.155 --> 00:41:50.388
The call sign for him
is big domino.

478
00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.823
Whatever shang does,

479
00:41:51.825 --> 00:41:53.892
at least four other nations
will follow.

480
00:41:53.894 --> 00:41:55.927
Louise? We have to
gain ground today.

481
00:41:55.929 --> 00:41:57.329
Okay.

482
00:41:57.331 --> 00:41:59.231
You have a vocabulary list
for me?

483
00:41:59.233 --> 00:42:00.899
I do.

484
00:42:04.971 --> 00:42:08.306
You're gonna teach them
your name and Ian's?

485
00:42:08.308 --> 00:42:10.008
Yes, so that
we can learn

486
00:42:10.010 --> 00:42:11.810
their names
if they have names,

487
00:42:11.812 --> 00:42:13.912
and then introduce
pronouns later.

488
00:42:13.914 --> 00:42:15.280
These are all
grade-school words:

489
00:42:15.282 --> 00:42:17.783
Eat, walk.

490
00:42:20.052 --> 00:42:21.853
Help me understand.

491
00:42:22.789 --> 00:42:24.389
Okay. Um...

492
00:42:27.794 --> 00:42:29.528
Oh, no, no, no!
Not the top!

493
00:42:34.967 --> 00:42:37.235
Okay, this is where
you wanna get to, right?

494
00:42:37.237 --> 00:42:38.937
That is the question.
Okay.

495
00:42:38.939 --> 00:42:41.139
So, first, we need to
make sure that

496
00:42:41.141 --> 00:42:43.275
they understand
what a question is.

497
00:42:43.277 --> 00:42:47.212
Okay, the nature of
a request for information

498
00:42:47.214 --> 00:42:48.947
along with a response.

499
00:42:48.949 --> 00:42:53.151
Then, we need to clarify
the difference between

500
00:42:53.153 --> 00:42:56.354
a specific "you"
and a collective "you,"

501
00:42:56.356 --> 00:43:00.525
because we don't wanna know
why Joe alien is here,

502
00:43:00.527 --> 00:43:03.495
we want to know
why they all landed.

503
00:43:03.497 --> 00:43:07.098
And purpose requires
an understanding of intent.

504
00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.400
We need to find out:

505
00:43:08.402 --> 00:43:10.402
Do they make
conscious choices?

506
00:43:10.404 --> 00:43:13.004
Or is their motivation
so instinctive

507
00:43:13.006 --> 00:43:15.874
that they don't understand
a "why" question at all?

508
00:43:15.876 --> 00:43:17.375
And... and biggest of all,

509
00:43:17.377 --> 00:43:19.845
we need to have enough
vocabulary with them

510
00:43:19.847 --> 00:43:21.479
that we understand
their answer.

511
00:43:24.016 --> 00:43:26.017
I get it.

512
00:43:26.019 --> 00:43:28.119
Stick to your list.

513
00:43:28.121 --> 00:43:29.588
Just

514
00:43:31.390 --> 00:43:33.458
don't add anything to it.

515
00:43:47.006 --> 00:43:49.074
<i>...are at 2.97.</i>

516
00:43:49.076 --> 00:43:51.209
<i>Oxygen level: 21.4%. Over.</i>

517
00:43:51.211 --> 00:43:53.945
<i>Condor, Alpha's now
in the nave.</i>

518
00:43:53.947 --> 00:43:56.882
<i>Setting up equipment
and telemetry. Over.</i>

519
00:43:56.884 --> 00:43:58.350
Let's get started.

520
00:44:08.027 --> 00:44:12.364
<i>Louise. Louise.
I am Louise.</i>

521
00:44:18.905 --> 00:44:20.906
<i>What is that?</i>

522
00:44:23.041 --> 00:44:24.042
<i>Is that a new symbol?
I can't tell.</i>

523
00:44:24.043 --> 00:44:27.312
<i>I don't know. I think it's
the symbol for human again.</i>

524
00:44:27.314 --> 00:44:30.048
<i>It just has a little
curl on the end,</i>

525
00:44:30.050 --> 00:44:32.050
<i>maybe to indicate
a question.</i>

526
00:44:32.052 --> 00:44:33.485
<i>I don't know.</i>

527
00:44:33.487 --> 00:44:34.920
<i>I don't know, Louise.</i>

528
00:44:34.922 --> 00:44:37.255
<i>I think
they're getting confused.</i>

529
00:44:37.257 --> 00:44:39.090
<i>Dr. banks,</i>

530
00:44:39.092 --> 00:44:41.126
<i>perhaps we should
move on to the next word.</i>

531
00:44:59.446 --> 00:45:00.979
<i>Dr. banks!</i>

532
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:03.415
<i>It's okay.</i>

533
00:45:03.417 --> 00:45:04.516
<i>What's going on?</i>

534
00:45:04.518 --> 00:45:06.084
<i>Hey! What are you doing?</i>

535
00:45:06.086 --> 00:45:07.352
Yeah, I'm fine.

536
00:45:07.354 --> 00:45:09.120
<i>Are you insane?</i>

537
00:45:09.122 --> 00:45:11.122
They need to see me.

538
00:45:11.124 --> 00:45:12.624
<i>She's taking off
her Hazmat suit.</i>

539
00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:16.361
Is it okay?

540
00:45:16.362 --> 00:45:17.595
<i>You're
risking contamination.</i>

541
00:45:17.597 --> 00:45:19.230
They need to see me.

542
00:45:19.232 --> 00:45:20.665
<i>Dr. banks...</i>

543
00:45:21.965 --> 00:45:22.767
<i>Dr. banks.</i>

544
00:45:22.867 --> 00:45:24.336
<i>She's walking
towards the screen.</i>

545
00:45:27.206 --> 00:45:29.140
<i>Should we abort?</i>

546
00:45:29.142 --> 00:45:31.309
<i>Recourse noted.
Stand by for further orders.</i>

547
00:45:31.311 --> 00:45:34.079
<i>Go back to your stations.</i>

548
00:46:48.487 --> 00:46:52.123
Now that's
a proper introduction. Hey.

549
00:47:03.235 --> 00:47:05.170
Louise.

550
00:47:07.473 --> 00:47:09.307
I am Louise.

551
00:47:09.309 --> 00:47:12.544
Ian, do you want to
introduce yourself?

552
00:47:15.181 --> 00:47:16.514
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

553
00:47:20.352 --> 00:47:22.487
Louise.

554
00:47:26.225 --> 00:47:27.826
<i>Screw it!</i>

555
00:47:31.597 --> 00:47:33.698
<i>Everybody dies, right?</i>

556
00:47:35.501 --> 00:47:39.270
<i>Sir, Donnelly is
taking off his Hazmat suit.</i>

557
00:47:39.272 --> 00:47:41.339
<i>Permission to abort?</i>

558
00:47:41.341 --> 00:47:43.108
<i>Continue the session.</i>

559
00:47:59.125 --> 00:48:00.758
Ian.

560
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:02.460
Louise.

561
00:48:03.662 --> 00:48:05.497
You...

562
00:48:06.765 --> 00:48:08.466
Who are you?

563
00:48:35.594 --> 00:48:37.495
I think those
are their names.

564
00:48:40.833 --> 00:48:42.800
They have names.

565
00:48:42.802 --> 00:48:45.336
So, what are
we gonna call them?

566
00:48:45.338 --> 00:48:46.838
I don't know.

567
00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.475
I was thinking
abbott and costello.

568
00:48:53.312 --> 00:48:54.779
Yeah.

569
00:48:54.781 --> 00:48:56.648
Yeah?
Yeah, I like it.

570
00:48:59.218 --> 00:49:01.319
I like it.

571
00:49:01.321 --> 00:49:02.687
Wow!

572
00:49:14.833 --> 00:49:17.435
<i>Team 1, exit your vehicle</i>

573
00:49:17.437 --> 00:49:21.206
<i>and proceed directly ahead
to the decontamination tent.</i>

574
00:49:26.278 --> 00:49:30.748
<i>Leave your respirator on until
you reach the equipment room.</i>

575
00:49:58.911 --> 00:50:01.646
I know. Shhh!

576
00:50:07.386 --> 00:50:10.255
<i>Team 2, exit your vehicles</i>

577
00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:13.691
<i>and continue to
the decontamination tent.</i>

578
00:50:13.693 --> 00:50:15.393
<i>Leave your respirators on</i>

579
00:50:15.395 --> 00:50:16.961
<i>and do not hesitate</i>

580
00:50:16.963 --> 00:50:18.896
<i>until you have reached
the equipment room.</i>

581
00:50:21.934 --> 00:50:23.601
<i>How do you feel?</i>

582
00:50:24.536 --> 00:50:26.437
Overworked.

583
00:50:26.439 --> 00:50:28.539
Well, I guess
i don't need to tell you

584
00:50:28.541 --> 00:50:29.941
you're putting yourself
at risk.

585
00:50:30.276 --> 00:50:33.611
There's no signs of
radiation poisoning yet.

586
00:50:33.613 --> 00:50:36.447
We'll see how
your blood tests look.

587
00:50:36.449 --> 00:50:38.950
For now, I'm gonna
give you another boost.

588
00:50:38.952 --> 00:50:40.551
Okay.

589
00:50:40.553 --> 00:50:42.453
No radiation.

590
00:50:42.455 --> 00:50:44.289
Nothing else
we can detect either,

591
00:50:44.291 --> 00:50:46.658
but I'd give them a strong
cocktail, regardless.

592
00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.527
It's the first time we've
made significant progress.

593
00:50:51.297 --> 00:50:54.999
All right.
We'll take the risk.

594
00:50:55.001 --> 00:50:56.567
Okay, honey...

595
00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:57.869
<i>What is going on there?</i>

596
00:50:57.871 --> 00:50:59.304
Honey...

597
00:50:59.306 --> 00:51:00.471
<i>Just tell me!</i>

598
00:51:00.473 --> 00:51:02.473
You don't need
to worry, okay?

599
00:51:02.475 --> 00:51:03.808
<i>How can I not worry?</i>

600
00:51:03.810 --> 00:51:06.811
Just calm down.

601
00:51:06.813 --> 00:51:10.715
<i>Becky asked me if the monsters
are going to kill daddy!</i>

602
00:51:10.717 --> 00:51:13.418
Honey,
it's not gonna happen.

603
00:51:15.821 --> 00:51:17.388
<i>Just stay safe.</i>

604
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:18.723
You don't need to worry.

605
00:51:18.725 --> 00:51:20.792
<i>Please! I'm so scared!</i>

606
00:51:23.762 --> 00:51:25.863
<i>All junior xenolinguistics</i>

607
00:51:25.865 --> 00:51:28.032
<i>and science personnel
must observe</i>

608
00:51:28.034 --> 00:51:30.802
<i>general curfew
unless expressly authorized</i>

609
00:51:30.804 --> 00:51:33.604
<i>for extended work hours
by unit cos.</i>

610
00:51:33.606 --> 00:51:37.375
<i>Curfew in effect
as of 2200 hours.</i>

611
00:51:37.743 --> 00:51:41.879
<i>Notice to all late workers,
fire watchers and night staff.</i>

612
00:51:41.881 --> 00:51:46.484
<i>Effective immediately, midnight
rations will be served all night.</i>

613
00:52:34.533 --> 00:52:36.768
<i>Here are some of
the many things</i>

614
00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:38.836
<i>we don't know about heptapods.</i>

615
00:52:38.838 --> 00:52:42.540
<i>Greek. Hepta, "seven."
Pod, "foot."</i>

616
00:52:42.542 --> 00:52:44.876
<i>Seven feet. Heptapod.</i>

617
00:52:46.577 --> 00:52:47.578
<i>Who are they?</i>

618
00:52:49.179 --> 00:52:50.848
<i>Trying to answer this
in any meaningful way</i>

619
00:52:50.850 --> 00:52:52.717
<i>is hampered by the fact that,</i>

620
00:52:52.719 --> 00:52:55.720
<i>outside being able to see them
and hear them,</i>

621
00:52:55.722 --> 00:52:58.856
<i>the heptapods leave
absolutely no footprint.</i>

622
00:53:00.559 --> 00:53:04.095
<i>The chemical composition of
their spaceship is unknown.</i>

623
00:53:04.097 --> 00:53:07.532
<i>The shell emits no waste,
no gas, no radiation.</i>

624
00:53:07.534 --> 00:53:10.802
<i>Assuming that the shells
communicate with each other,</i>

625
00:53:10.804 --> 00:53:13.538
<i>they do so without detection.</i>

626
00:53:13.540 --> 00:53:16.007
<i>The air between the shells
is untroubled</i>

627
00:53:16.009 --> 00:53:18.042
<i>by Sonic emission
or light wave.</i>

628
00:53:19.645 --> 00:53:22.079
<i>Are they scientists?
Or tourists?</i>

629
00:53:22.081 --> 00:53:23.681
<i>If they're scientists,</i>

630
00:53:23.683 --> 00:53:25.950
<i>they don't seem to ask
a lot of questions.</i>

631
00:53:28.921 --> 00:53:31.489
<i>Why did they park
where they did?</i>

632
00:53:31.491 --> 00:53:34.926
<i>The world's most decorated
experts can't crack that one.</i>

633
00:53:34.928 --> 00:53:36.694
<i>The most plausible theory is</i>

634
00:53:36.794 --> 00:53:37.996
<i>that they chose
places on earth</i>

635
00:53:38.196 --> 00:53:40.832
<i>with the lowest incidence
of lightning strikes.</i>

636
00:53:40.834 --> 00:53:42.867
<i>But there are exceptions.</i>

637
00:53:42.869 --> 00:53:44.969
<i>The next most
plausible theory is that</i>

638
00:53:44.971 --> 00:53:46.704
<i>sheena Easton had a hit song</i>

639
00:53:46.706 --> 00:53:48.139
<i>at each of these sites
in 1980.</i>

640
00:53:48.141 --> 00:53:49.941
<i>So, we just don't know.</i>

641
00:53:52.611 --> 00:53:54.979
<i>How do they communicate?</i>

642
00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:58.082
<i>Here, Louise is
putting us all to shame.</i>

643
00:53:58.084 --> 00:53:59.884
<i>The first breakthrough was</i>

644
00:53:59.886 --> 00:54:02.653
<i>to discover that
there's no correlation</i>

645
00:54:02.655 --> 00:54:06.524
<i>between what a heptapod says
and what a heptapod writes.</i>

646
00:54:21.173 --> 00:54:23.741
<i>Unlike all written
human languages,</i>

647
00:54:23.743 --> 00:54:26.177
<i>their writing
is semasiographic.</i>

648
00:54:26.179 --> 00:54:29.847
<i>It conveys meaning.
It doesn't represent sound.</i>

649
00:54:34.219 --> 00:54:36.554
<i>Perhaps they view
our form of writing</i>

650
00:54:36.556 --> 00:54:38.923
<i>as a wasted opportunity,</i>

651
00:54:38.925 --> 00:54:41.626
<i>passing up a second
communications channel.</i>

652
00:54:46.698 --> 00:54:49.600
<i>We have our friends
in Pakistan to thank</i>

653
00:54:49.602 --> 00:54:52.670
<i>for their study of
how heptapods write,</i>

654
00:54:52.672 --> 00:54:56.674
<i>because unlike speech,
a logogram is free of time.</i>

655
00:54:59.545 --> 00:55:01.612
<i>Like their ship
or their bodies,</i>

656
00:55:01.614 --> 00:55:03.981
<i>their written language
has no forward</i>

657
00:55:04.081 --> 00:55:05.183
<i>or backward direction.</i>

658
00:55:05.383 --> 00:55:09.687
<i>Linguists call this
non-linear orthography,</i>

659
00:55:09.689 --> 00:55:12.890
<i>which raises the question,
"is this how they think?"</i>

660
00:55:14.593 --> 00:55:17.862
<i>Imagine you wanted to write
a sentence using two hands,</i>

661
00:55:17.962 --> 00:55:19.464
<i>starting from either side.</i>

662
00:55:20.164 --> 00:55:22.767
<i>You would have to know
each word you wanted to use,</i>

663
00:55:22.769 --> 00:55:25.670
<i>as well as how much space
they would occupy.</i>

664
00:55:27.773 --> 00:55:29.874
<i>A heptapod can write
a complex sentence</i>

665
00:55:29.876 --> 00:55:32.076
<i>in two seconds, effortlessly.</i>

666
00:55:32.078 --> 00:55:35.012
<i>It's taken us a month
to make the simplest reply.</i>

667
00:55:35.014 --> 00:55:38.115
<i>Next, expanding vocabulary.</i>

668
00:55:38.117 --> 00:55:39.917
<i>Louise thinks it could
easily take another month</i>

669
00:55:39.919 --> 00:55:41.586
<i>to be ready for that.</i>

670
00:55:58.804 --> 00:56:00.605
Hey...

671
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.174
Oh, hey.

672
00:56:03.176 --> 00:56:05.610
Weber's looking for you.

673
00:56:05.612 --> 00:56:08.245
Yeah, well, why do you think
I'm hiding out here?

674
00:56:09.782 --> 00:56:11.282
Come on up!

675
00:56:13.218 --> 00:56:14.919
Thanks.

676
00:56:17.623 --> 00:56:19.890
Nice out here, huh?

677
00:56:19.892 --> 00:56:22.259
Yeah, it's a nice view.

678
00:56:22.261 --> 00:56:24.629
Away from the noise.

679
00:56:27.766 --> 00:56:29.867
You know, I was just
thinking about you.

680
00:56:32.771 --> 00:56:34.839
You approach language
like a mathematician.

681
00:56:34.841 --> 00:56:38.075
You know that, right?

682
00:56:38.077 --> 00:56:40.344
I will take that
as a compliment.

683
00:56:40.346 --> 00:56:41.979
Yeah, well, it is.

684
00:56:44.083 --> 00:56:48.019
As I watch you steer us around
these communication traps

685
00:56:48.021 --> 00:56:50.154
that I didn't
even know existed,

686
00:56:50.156 --> 00:56:51.989
it's like, "what?"

687
00:56:54.092 --> 00:56:56.093
I guess that's why I'm single.

688
00:56:56.095 --> 00:56:59.230
Trust me, you can
understand communication

689
00:56:59.232 --> 00:57:00.998
and still end up single.

690
00:57:10.142 --> 00:57:13.844
I feel like everything
that happens in there

691
00:57:13.846 --> 00:57:15.780
comes down to the two of us.

692
00:57:17.783 --> 00:57:19.850
Yeah, that's a good thing
though, right?

693
00:57:19.852 --> 00:57:21.285
You and I?

694
00:57:24.756 --> 00:57:28.125
Have you seen the jokers
that we're working with?

695
00:57:28.127 --> 00:57:29.827
Thank god I've got you!

696
00:57:40.971 --> 00:57:41.972
<i>Tonight,</i>

697
00:57:41.973 --> 00:57:45.242
<i>the first photograph
of the aliens goes viral.</i>

698
00:57:45.244 --> 00:57:48.112
<i>Biological contamination

00:57:48.212 --> 00:57:49.314

handling of the crisis.</i>

703
00:57:56.189 --> 00:57:59.156
<i>All this,
and more special coverage.</i>

704
00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.993
<i>First contact with whoever it
is that is inside that thing,</i>

705
00:58:02.995 --> 00:58:04.361
<i>and who's running the show?</i>

706
00:58:04.461 --> 00:58:05.463
<i>The government.</i>

707
00:58:05.663 --> 00:58:07.865
<i>That's right, folks,
the same government</i>

708
00:58:07.867 --> 00:58:10.401
<i>who ruined our healthcare
and bankrupted our military.</i>

709
00:58:10.501 --> 00:58:11.503
<i>Look at these people!</i>

710
00:58:11.603 --> 00:58:13.404
<i>Most of them
don't even have guns!</i>

711
00:58:13.406 --> 00:58:15.906
<i>We could be facing
a full-scale invasion.</i>

712
00:58:15.908 --> 00:58:17.341
<i>Our president's
willing to sit back</i>

713
00:58:17.343 --> 00:58:19.744
<i>and let them waltz in
and take our country.</i>

714
00:58:19.746 --> 00:58:22.046
<i>We are falling asleep
at the wheel, people!</i>

715
00:58:22.048 --> 00:58:24.281
<i>You know what I'm talking
about. I know you do.</i>

716
00:58:24.283 --> 00:58:26.817
<i>What if the smartest thing
we could do right now</i>

717
00:58:26.819 --> 00:58:28.753
<i>would be to give them
a show of force?</i>

718
00:58:28.755 --> 00:58:30.821
<i>I'm talking about
a shot across the bow.</i>

719
00:58:30.921 --> 00:58:32.023
<i>What do you think?</i>

720
00:58:32.123 --> 00:58:33.324
<i>Caller no. 1,
you're on the air.</i>

721
00:58:33.326 --> 00:58:34.825
<i>What do you think?</i>

722
00:59:00.919 --> 00:59:02.820
<i>What's this word?</i>

723
00:59:18.937 --> 00:59:20.237
<i>Planet.</i>

724
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:28.879
That's, like, um...
The earth is a planet.

725
00:59:28.881 --> 00:59:32.950
<i>Want to see my project
for miss garriott's class?</i>

726
00:59:32.952 --> 00:59:34.585
Yeah, little nose.

727
00:59:37.489 --> 00:59:40.357
We had to make up
our own TV show.

728
00:59:40.359 --> 00:59:42.426
If we had one.

729
00:59:42.428 --> 00:59:44.061
And who are
those two people?

730
00:59:44.063 --> 00:59:45.462
That's you and dad.

731
00:59:45.464 --> 00:59:47.064
The show is called

732
00:59:47.066 --> 00:59:49.266
"mommy and daddy
talk to animals."

733
00:59:49.268 --> 00:59:51.202
Oh!

734
00:59:51.204 --> 00:59:53.237
Well, it's lovely.

735
00:59:57.242 --> 00:59:58.609
Okay...

736
00:59:59.544 --> 01:00:01.245
Um...

737
01:00:02.514 --> 01:00:05.049
You know it's okay to be sad
that your dad and I...

738
01:00:05.051 --> 01:00:06.517
I know. I'm not.

739
01:00:08.453 --> 01:00:10.955
'Cause we both
love you very much.

740
01:00:10.957 --> 01:00:13.457
I know. It's just a cartoon.
It's not real.

741
01:00:13.459 --> 01:00:15.192
<i>Louise?</i>

742
01:00:19.197 --> 01:00:20.631
You all right?

743
01:00:21.566 --> 01:00:24.969
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

744
01:00:26.872 --> 01:00:31.141
I'm not sure it's something
i can... I can explain.

745
01:00:31.143 --> 01:00:34.044
When was your last
checkup with Dr. kettler?

746
01:00:34.046 --> 01:00:35.913
I'm okay.

747
01:00:35.915 --> 01:00:38.249
I'm gonna get some air.

748
01:00:38.251 --> 01:00:40.317
I'm okay.
All right.

749
01:00:40.319 --> 01:00:42.119
I'm fine. Yep.

750
01:01:41.146 --> 01:01:43.480
<i>How you feeling?</i>

751
01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:45.282
<i>Um...</i>

752
01:01:46.484 --> 01:01:51.088
I need some sleep,
but I'm fine.

753
01:01:51.090 --> 01:01:52.423
Yeah.

754
01:01:53.658 --> 01:01:56.093
You know, I was doing
some reading, um,

755
01:01:56.095 --> 01:01:57.494
about this idea

756
01:01:57.496 --> 01:02:01.031
that if you immerse yourself
into a foreign language,

757
01:02:01.033 --> 01:02:03.567
then you can actually
rewire your brain.

758
01:02:03.569 --> 01:02:05.636
The sapir-whorf hypothesis.

759
01:02:05.638 --> 01:02:07.638
Mm-hmm.

760
01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.373
The theory that, uh...

761
01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:11.442
It... it's the theory
that, uh,

762
01:02:11.444 --> 01:02:13.277
the language
you speak determines

763
01:02:13.279 --> 01:02:14.678
how you think and...

764
01:02:14.680 --> 01:02:17.314
Yeah. It affects
how you see everything.

765
01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:18.649
It was, uh...

766
01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:21.118
I'm curious...

767
01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:23.387
Are you dreaming
in their language?

768
01:02:33.164 --> 01:02:36.266
I may have had a few dreams,
but I don't...

769
01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:41.405
I don't think that that
makes me unfit to do this job.

770
01:03:00.625 --> 01:03:02.026
Did you sleep?

771
01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:03.227
A little.

772
01:03:04.162 --> 01:03:05.529
Do you know
mandarin?

773
01:03:09.701 --> 01:03:11.301
It is shifting.

774
01:03:18.209 --> 01:03:20.444
The voice
you're about to hear

775
01:03:20.446 --> 01:03:22.780
belongs to
a Chinese military chief...

776
01:03:24.182 --> 01:03:26.316
General shang.

777
01:03:26.318 --> 01:03:27.785
Pull it up!

778
01:03:30.722 --> 01:03:33.457
We got a satellite feed here
of who he's talking to,

779
01:03:33.459 --> 01:03:35.459
if you want to look.

780
01:03:35.461 --> 01:03:37.127
Wait, go back.

781
01:03:38.463 --> 01:03:40.130
Stop.

782
01:03:41.766 --> 01:03:44.068
He's saying that
each of the 12

783
01:03:44.070 --> 01:03:46.136
is offering
advanced technology.

784
01:03:48.206 --> 01:03:50.541
Go back again.
And play.

785
01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:53.677
Um...

786
01:03:53.679 --> 01:03:58.282
"Our science team is attempting
to decode the sets."

787
01:03:58.550 --> 01:04:01.285
"Sets." I don't know
what that means.

788
01:04:01.287 --> 01:04:03.220
Something about advantage,

789
01:04:03.222 --> 01:04:05.756
suits, honor and,
uh, flowers.

790
01:04:05.758 --> 01:04:07.458
I don't...

791
01:04:08.393 --> 01:04:10.427
I don't know. That's all.

792
01:04:10.429 --> 01:04:13.230
I don't know
what it means either.

793
01:04:13.232 --> 01:04:15.399
An hour ago,
China mobilized forces.

794
01:04:15.401 --> 01:04:18.235
And now, Russia's
following suit.

795
01:04:18.237 --> 01:04:20.370
Shang's about to
start something.

796
01:04:20.372 --> 01:04:22.439
Following suit. Suits.

797
01:04:24.375 --> 01:04:27.177
Suits, honor, flowers...

798
01:04:27.179 --> 01:04:29.847
Colonel, those are
all tile sets in mah-jongg.

799
01:04:31.583 --> 01:04:33.550
God, are they...

800
01:04:33.552 --> 01:04:36.753
Are they using a game to
converse with their heptapods?

801
01:04:38.389 --> 01:04:40.524
Maybe. Why?

802
01:04:40.526 --> 01:04:44.128
Well, let's say that i taught
them chess instead of English.

803
01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:46.196
Every conversation
would be a game.

804
01:04:46.198 --> 01:04:49.333
Every idea expressed through
opposition, victory, defeat.

805
01:04:49.335 --> 01:04:50.667
You see the problem?

806
01:04:50.669 --> 01:04:52.469
Hmm...

807
01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:54.738
If all I ever gave
you was a hammer...

808
01:04:54.740 --> 01:04:56.740
Everything's a nail.

809
01:04:58.309 --> 01:05:00.544
We need to ask
the big question.

810
01:05:01.579 --> 01:05:03.413
Ready or not.

811
01:05:16.394 --> 01:05:18.529
Yeah, I know,
but between there and there.

812
01:05:20.232 --> 01:05:22.466
Well, it's
time to go.

813
01:05:43.855 --> 01:05:45.756
Okay...

814
01:05:49.794 --> 01:05:52.296
Heptapods' purpose.

815
01:06:01.673 --> 01:06:05.442
Heptapod purpose earth.
What is your purpose?

816
01:06:12.383 --> 01:06:14.551
Do we only have costello?

817
01:06:19.490 --> 01:06:21.858
Okay. There you are.

818
01:06:43.381 --> 01:06:44.848
What does it say?

819
01:06:53.424 --> 01:06:55.292
Offer weapon.

820
01:06:59.964 --> 01:07:01.331
You saw what they wrote!

821
01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:02.633
Using a word
they don't fully understand.

822
01:07:02.635 --> 01:07:04.368
Could be a request.
A warning.

823
01:07:04.370 --> 01:07:07.371
Enough! Louise?

824
01:07:07.373 --> 01:07:09.473
We don't know
if they understand

825
01:07:09.475 --> 01:07:12.442
the difference between
a weapon and a tool.

826
01:07:12.444 --> 01:07:14.411
Our language, like
our culture, is messy,

827
01:07:14.413 --> 01:07:15.912
and sometimes,
one can be both.

828
01:07:15.914 --> 01:07:17.481
And it's quite possible

829
01:07:17.483 --> 01:07:19.750
that they're asking us
to offer them something,

830
01:07:19.752 --> 01:07:21.351
not the other way around.

831
01:07:21.353 --> 01:07:23.520
It's like the first
part of a trade.

832
01:07:23.522 --> 01:07:25.489
So, how do we clarify
their intentions

833
01:07:25.491 --> 01:07:26.823
beyond those two words?

834
01:07:26.923 --> 01:07:27.925
Well, I go back in.

835
01:07:28.125 --> 01:07:29.860
Right away, we go back in
and we clear this up.

836
01:07:29.862 --> 01:07:31.662
It's more complicated
than that.

837
01:07:31.664 --> 01:07:34.464
How is it more complicated
than that?

838
01:07:34.466 --> 01:07:36.633
Colonel,
the secretary of defense

839
01:07:36.635 --> 01:07:38.368
is on the line for you.

840
01:07:44.909 --> 01:07:46.877
We need to sit
on this information

841
01:07:46.879 --> 01:07:48.478
till we know what it means,

842
01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:50.447
so we aren't sharing it
with our enemies.

843
01:07:50.547 --> 01:07:51.449
We must consider the idea

844
01:07:51.649 --> 01:07:53.884
that our visitors are prodding
us to fight among ourselves

845
01:07:53.886 --> 01:07:56.553
until only one
faction prevails.

846
01:07:56.555 --> 01:07:58.555
There's no evidence of that.
Sure there is.

847
01:07:58.557 --> 01:08:00.924
Just grab a history book.

848
01:08:00.926 --> 01:08:04.695
The British with India,
the Germans with Rwanda.

849
01:08:04.697 --> 01:08:07.331
They even got
a name for it in Hungary.

850
01:08:11.836 --> 01:08:16.707
Yeah. We're a world
with no single leader.

851
01:08:16.709 --> 01:08:18.475
It's impossible to
deal with just one of us.

852
01:08:18.477 --> 01:08:20.844
And with the word
"weapon" now...

853
01:08:20.846 --> 01:08:24.648
Halpern. Yes, sir!

854
01:08:24.848 --> 01:08:31.848
PEPPER & LALASPAIN

855
01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:45.869
No confirmation yet.
Standing by.

856
01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:49.873
Anything?
What did they say?

857
01:08:51.075 --> 01:08:52.542
China and Russia
are off the grid.

858
01:08:52.642 --> 01:08:53.744
They aren't speaking
to anyone.

859
01:08:53.844 --> 01:08:57.614
Whatever they learned in their
last session has them spooked.

860
01:08:59.550 --> 01:09:00.717
Yes, sir!

861
01:09:00.719 --> 01:09:02.619
We have orders
to do the same.

862
01:09:02.621 --> 01:09:03.820
These are our allies!

863
01:09:03.822 --> 01:09:05.021
You can't shut us down!

864
01:09:05.023 --> 01:09:06.823
Put us on radio silence.
Do it.

865
01:09:06.825 --> 01:09:10.560
We received a message
from the hept... damn it!

866
01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:12.996
We need to be
talking to each other!

867
01:09:12.998 --> 01:09:15.866
You want to talk to them?
Find out what this means.

868
01:09:20.905 --> 01:09:23.006
<i>Base-camp talk
is now offline.</i>

869
01:09:23.008 --> 01:09:25.542
<i>All interpreters and
international liaisons,</i>

870
01:09:25.544 --> 01:09:29.446
<i>stand down and
report to unit coordinators.</i>

871
01:09:30.915 --> 01:09:33.683
We've never
re-entered a session before.

872
01:09:33.685 --> 01:09:36.453
Louise, trust me, okay?
We've got time.

873
01:09:36.455 --> 01:09:38.655
We've just gotta
step on it, all right?

874
01:09:38.657 --> 01:09:40.690
<i>"Use weapon."</i>

875
01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:42.192
<i>This is the alien message</i>

876
01:09:42.292 --> 01:09:44.494
<i>said to have provoked
the Chinese government</i>

877
01:09:44.496 --> 01:09:46.129
<i>to withdraw
their scientists from</i>

878
01:09:46.131 --> 01:09:47.864
<i>the international
mission today.</i>

879
01:09:47.866 --> 01:09:50.100
<i>In a statement,
general shang said,</i>

880
01:09:50.102 --> 01:09:52.469
<i>"China no longer trusts
the aliens</i>

881
01:09:52.471 --> 01:09:53.837
<i>"who want to divide us.</i>

882
01:09:53.839 --> 01:09:56.640
<i>"Humanity must be protected."</i>

883
01:09:56.642 --> 01:09:59.443
<i>China has asked for immediate
talks at the un.</i>

884
01:10:02.113 --> 01:10:04.114
<i>Alpha-one-niner,</i>

885
01:10:04.116 --> 01:10:05.782
<i>this is condor, over.</i>

886
01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:13.857
<i>Alpha-one-niner,
this is condor, come in. Over.</i>

887
01:10:18.463 --> 01:10:21.498
<i>Captain marks, condor
not receiving transmission.</i>

888
01:10:21.699 --> 01:10:23.700
<i>Squelch twice
if you hear line.</i>

889
01:10:24.635 --> 01:10:26.536
<i>Captain marks,
all escort units</i>

890
01:10:26.538 --> 01:10:28.238
<i>are ordered to
cease all activity.</i>

891
01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:01.204
No, no, no. Dr. banks,
you can't go in there.

892
01:11:01.206 --> 01:11:03.173
I just need to
ask one question.

893
01:11:03.175 --> 01:11:05.609
Dr. banks!
The session is finished.

894
01:11:05.611 --> 01:11:07.744
You can't... you can't go
back in. It's dangerous.

895
01:11:07.746 --> 01:11:09.646
Look, we just need
five minutes. Don't sweat it.

896
01:11:09.648 --> 01:11:11.548
Marks, let them go.

897
01:11:14.085 --> 01:11:16.086
Hey, abbott!

898
01:11:21.025 --> 01:11:24.160
So, what are we calling
this? Session 37?

899
01:11:24.162 --> 01:11:26.830
Uh, no, 36, part 2.

900
01:11:34.038 --> 01:11:35.739
Why are
they on their own?

901
01:11:35.741 --> 01:11:38.074
We've been attempting
to hail captain marks.

902
01:11:38.076 --> 01:11:39.943
The escort units
are not responding, sir.

903
01:11:39.945 --> 01:11:43.113
Why not? Send security.

904
01:11:46.617 --> 01:11:50.153
"Offer weapon,
question mark."

905
01:11:55.159 --> 01:11:57.761
Are you offering us
something?

906
01:12:06.203 --> 01:12:09.239
Technology,
apparatus, method?

907
01:12:09.241 --> 01:12:11.641
Yeah, see,
this is a different word.

908
01:12:11.643 --> 01:12:14.311
This... this segment,
it's a lot busier.

909
01:12:19.684 --> 01:12:23.219
Give technology

910
01:12:24.589 --> 01:12:26.222
now.

911
01:12:34.766 --> 01:12:36.800
What's he doing?

912
01:12:41.772 --> 01:12:43.740
<i>Captain, on your ten.</i>

913
01:12:52.717 --> 01:12:54.851
<i>Security detail inbound, sir.</i>

914
01:12:54.853 --> 01:12:57.621
<i>T-minus 4 minutes remaining.
We need to see this through.</i>

915
01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.723
<i>Okay, this is it.
Lock and load.</i>

916
01:12:59.725 --> 01:13:01.992
<i>We just need to
hold them off until it's done.</i>

917
01:13:01.994 --> 01:13:04.661
<i>Copy that. Warning shots
and suppressive fire only.</i>

918
01:13:04.761 --> 01:13:06.063
<i>Load up
and get to cover.</i>

919
01:13:06.163 --> 01:13:08.131
<i>Stay frosty and
we can avoid casualties.</i>

920
01:13:34.725 --> 01:13:37.193
Abbott wants me to
write on the barrier.

921
01:13:42.099 --> 01:13:44.034
Can you
even do that?

922
01:13:45.169 --> 01:13:47.037
I don't know.

923
01:14:02.887 --> 01:14:04.821
I can't do it
with both hands.

924
01:15:16.093 --> 01:15:17.961
Louise...

925
01:15:33.111 --> 01:15:34.410
What is that?

926
01:16:19.924 --> 01:16:22.492
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey. Take it easy.

927
01:16:22.494 --> 01:16:25.361
You suffered a concussion.
Just lay back.

928
01:16:28.299 --> 01:16:30.433
How do you feel?

929
01:16:38.442 --> 01:16:40.109
How is Ian?

930
01:16:40.111 --> 01:16:42.312
Same as you. He's okay.

931
01:16:43.547 --> 01:16:46.382
Who, um...
Who did this?

932
01:16:46.384 --> 01:16:48.251
Ah, some soldiers.

933
01:16:48.253 --> 01:16:50.520
They've been watching
too much TV.

934
01:16:53.457 --> 01:16:55.191
What is that?

935
01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:56.993
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

936
01:16:56.995 --> 01:17:01.364
The site's no longer secure.
We're standing by to evacuate.

937
01:17:01.366 --> 01:17:03.366
Where's Ian?

938
01:17:03.368 --> 01:17:06.336
Weber came and got him
maybe 10 minutes ago.

939
01:17:06.338 --> 01:17:09.205
He wouldn't leave until
he knew you were okay.

940
01:17:12.343 --> 01:17:14.010
Your whole tent
is on the clock

941
01:17:14.012 --> 01:17:16.913
to figure out whatever it is
you were given up there.

942
01:17:22.486 --> 01:17:24.087
This is all of it?

943
01:17:24.089 --> 01:17:26.589
The feed wasn't interrupted
by the explosion?

944
01:17:28.092 --> 01:17:30.126
Not as far as I can see.

945
01:17:31.428 --> 01:17:33.062
You see something?

946
01:17:33.064 --> 01:17:34.530
Oh, I don't know yet.

947
01:17:34.532 --> 01:17:37.467
I'm gonna need my team to get
together with Louise's team.

948
01:17:37.469 --> 01:17:39.168
I need everybody
working on this.

949
01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:40.603
We cannot leave.

950
01:17:40.703 --> 01:17:42.005
Glad to see
you're awake.

951
01:17:42.105 --> 01:17:45.074
We need to go back in and
explain this wasn't our fault.

952
01:17:45.076 --> 01:17:47.110
We can't go back inside.
We have to.

953
01:17:47.112 --> 01:17:49.445
What happened in there
was an attack.

954
01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:50.947
We can hope for the best,

955
01:17:51.047 --> 01:17:52.115
but I have orders to
prepare for retaliation.

956
01:17:52.117 --> 01:17:53.549
We may have to evacuate.

957
01:17:53.649 --> 01:17:54.851
No, that's the wrong move.

958
01:17:55.051 --> 01:17:57.053
As long as they stay,
we have to stay.

959
01:18:31.188 --> 01:18:33.222
Well, they're not leaving.

960
01:18:35.225 --> 01:18:37.126
Why does this feel worse?

961
01:18:41.532 --> 01:18:43.633
<i>China is
on the offensive.</i>

962
01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:45.468
<i>They're positioning
the military</i>

963
01:18:45.470 --> 01:18:47.236
<i>to blow the alien vessel
right out of the sky.</i>

964
01:18:47.238 --> 01:18:49.105
<i>And if this happens,</i>

965
01:18:49.107 --> 01:18:50.473
<i>we can't sit around
waiting for retaliation.</i>

966
01:18:50.475 --> 01:18:52.175
<i>So, get prepared.</i>

967
01:18:53.143 --> 01:18:55.411
<i>The air force and infantry
are standing by.</i>

968
01:18:55.413 --> 01:18:56.479
Yes, sir.

969
01:18:58.082 --> 01:19:01.651
<i>Tonight, China becomes
the first world power</i>

970
01:19:01.653 --> 01:19:04.487
<i>to declare war
against the aliens.</i>

971
01:19:04.489 --> 01:19:07.190
<i>Following the failure of
diplomatic efforts</i>

972
01:19:07.192 --> 01:19:08.658
<i>at the united nations,</i>

973
01:19:08.660 --> 01:19:12.128
<i>China has confirmed that its
language experts have tonight</i>

974
01:19:12.130 --> 01:19:14.530
<i>delivered an ultimatum
at the Shanghai site.</i>

975
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:15.832
<i>In a televised statement,</i>

976
01:19:16.032 --> 01:19:19.202
<i>general shang, chairman of
the people's liberation army,</i>

977
01:19:19.204 --> 01:19:23.039
<i>said the aliens have 24 hours
to leave Chinese territory</i>

978
01:19:23.041 --> 01:19:24.374
<i>or face destruction.</i>

979
01:19:24.376 --> 01:19:26.576
<i>And he urged
all other world leaders</i>

980
01:19:26.578 --> 01:19:29.679
<i>to unite with China
and take a similar stance.</i>

981
01:19:30.514 --> 01:19:34.317
<i>With a huge buildup of forces
at their landing sites,</i>

982
01:19:34.319 --> 01:19:37.153
<i>Pakistan, Russia and Sudan
are thought to be</i>

983
01:19:37.155 --> 01:19:38.721
<i>following China's lead.</i>

984
01:19:54.405 --> 01:19:56.472
It can't be random.

985
01:20:11.422 --> 01:20:14.157
It's going
to take us years.

986
01:20:19.096 --> 01:20:21.130
<i>What's this term here?</i>

987
01:20:24.201 --> 01:20:26.135
<i>Mom...</i>

988
01:20:28.605 --> 01:20:30.306
Mom...

989
01:20:30.308 --> 01:20:31.741
Hmm? Sweetie...

990
01:20:31.743 --> 01:20:34.177
Uh, what's this term
for that thing,

991
01:20:34.179 --> 01:20:36.145
like a...
Like a technical term,

992
01:20:36.147 --> 01:20:37.613
where we make a deal,

993
01:20:37.615 --> 01:20:39.682
and we both
get something out of it.

994
01:20:39.684 --> 01:20:41.551
A compromise.

995
01:20:41.553 --> 01:20:43.086
No...

996
01:20:43.088 --> 01:20:45.354
Like, it's a competition.

997
01:20:45.356 --> 01:20:47.090
Mm-hmm...

998
01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:48.591
But both sides end up happy.

999
01:20:49.793 --> 01:20:51.360
Like a win-win.

1000
01:20:51.362 --> 01:20:53.529
More science-y than that.

1001
01:20:53.531 --> 01:20:56.632
If you want science,
call your father.

1002
01:21:11.249 --> 01:21:12.381
Thank you.

1003
01:21:23.127 --> 01:21:24.794
Sorry.

1004
01:21:24.796 --> 01:21:26.262
It's okay.

1005
01:21:26.264 --> 01:21:28.231
I'm up.

1006
01:21:32.136 --> 01:21:33.603
What time is it?

1007
01:21:35.172 --> 01:21:37.206
It's time you opened that
bottle you've been hiding.

1008
01:21:41.678 --> 01:21:44.347
You cracked something,
didn't you?

1009
01:21:44.349 --> 01:21:45.615
Yeah. Come here.

1010
01:21:47.484 --> 01:21:49.185
Take a look
at this section.

1011
01:21:49.187 --> 01:21:51.821
It seems to be
talking about time.

1012
01:21:51.823 --> 01:21:54.557
Their symbol for time
is everywhere.

1013
01:21:54.559 --> 01:21:56.225
So what is this?

1014
01:21:57.494 --> 01:22:00.696
A formula for
faster-than-light travel?

1015
01:22:00.698 --> 01:22:02.832
Who can tell?

1016
01:22:02.834 --> 01:22:04.567
There are too many gaps.

1017
01:22:04.569 --> 01:22:06.235
Nothing's complete.

1018
01:22:06.237 --> 01:22:07.703
Then it dawned on me.

1019
01:22:07.705 --> 01:22:09.372
Come here.

1020
01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:12.208
Right here.

1021
01:22:12.210 --> 01:22:16.179
Stop focusing on the ones.
Look at the zeroes.

1022
01:22:16.181 --> 01:22:18.181
How much of
this is data?

1023
01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:20.716
How much of it
is negative space?

1024
01:22:20.718 --> 01:22:22.685
So, I measured it.

1025
01:22:24.321 --> 01:22:26.789
0.0833 recurring.

1026
01:22:32.529 --> 01:22:35.264
Perhaps you'd
like that as a fraction.

1027
01:22:38.202 --> 01:22:39.969
One of twelve.

1028
01:22:42.739 --> 01:22:46.375
What they're saying right here
is that this is one of 12.

1029
01:22:46.377 --> 01:22:48.344
"We are part
of a larger whole."

1030
01:22:48.346 --> 01:22:50.513
Or we're one of 12
contestants for the prize.

1031
01:22:50.515 --> 01:22:51.914
Why do I have
to talk to him?

1032
01:22:51.916 --> 01:22:53.482
We're all working together.

1033
01:22:53.484 --> 01:22:55.785
We need to talk to
the other sites,

1034
01:22:55.787 --> 01:22:58.487
help them with what they've
gotten from the heptapods.

1035
01:22:58.489 --> 01:22:59.689
We're blacked out.

1036
01:22:59.691 --> 01:23:01.924
China just threatened
to destroy their shell.

1037
01:23:02.024 --> 01:23:03.126
We're on our own.

1038
01:23:03.226 --> 01:23:04.894
But this says that all of
the pieces fit together.

1039
01:23:04.896 --> 01:23:06.862
And I'm telling you
that no one else cares.

1040
01:23:07.396 --> 01:23:08.397
Two hours ago,

1041
01:23:08.398 --> 01:23:10.700
we pulled this audio off
a secure channel in Russia.

1042
01:23:10.702 --> 01:23:13.502
Someone on the science team
there was broadcasting wide.

1043
01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:18.641
<i>In their final session,
the aliens said,</i>

1044
01:23:18.643 --> 01:23:21.711
<i>"there is no time.
Many become one."</i>

1045
01:23:21.713 --> 01:23:24.413
<i>I fear we have
all been given weapons.</i>

1046
01:23:24.415 --> 01:23:28.251
<i>If anyone is receiving this,
please...</i>

1047
01:23:34.291 --> 01:23:35.658
Well, I mean,

1048
01:23:36.793 --> 01:23:38.294
there are a lot of ways

1049
01:23:38.296 --> 01:23:39.662
you can interpret
what he said.

1050
01:23:39.664 --> 01:23:41.797
I don't need an interpreter
to know what this means.

1051
01:23:41.799 --> 01:23:43.933
Russia just executed
one of their own experts

1052
01:23:44.033 --> 01:23:45.135
to keep their secret.

1053
01:23:45.235 --> 01:23:47.803
"Many become one" could
just be their way of saying

1054
01:23:47.805 --> 01:23:49.672
"some assembly required."

1055
01:23:49.674 --> 01:23:51.540
Why hand it out to us
in pieces?

1056
01:23:51.542 --> 01:23:53.342
Why not just
give it all over?

1057
01:23:53.344 --> 01:23:55.611
What better way to force us
to work together for once?

1058
01:23:56.679 --> 01:23:57.980
Even if I did believe you,

1059
01:23:57.981 --> 01:24:00.750
how in the world are you gonna
get anybody else to play along

1060
01:24:00.752 --> 01:24:02.752
and give up their data?

1061
01:24:02.754 --> 01:24:05.288
We offer ours
in return.

1062
01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:06.689
Yeah?

1063
01:24:06.691 --> 01:24:08.357
A trade?

1064
01:24:08.359 --> 01:24:09.759
It's a non-zero-sum
game.

1065
01:24:12.462 --> 01:24:15.031
Non-zero-sum game.

1066
01:24:15.732 --> 01:24:18.000
That's it. Yeah.

1067
01:24:18.002 --> 01:24:19.935
Thanks.

1068
01:24:25.442 --> 01:24:28.311
Nine of
the landing sites have gone

1069
01:24:28.511 --> 01:24:29.513
total comms blackout.

1070
01:24:30.013 --> 01:24:31.614
Only way to reach them is
to physically drive there

1071
01:24:31.616 --> 01:24:33.983
and yell at the border guards,
which we're doing,

1072
01:24:33.985 --> 01:24:35.484
but it won't be
fast enough.

1073
01:24:35.486 --> 01:24:37.853
There must be a way to
get the message to them.

1074
01:24:37.855 --> 01:24:40.856
To our allies, maybe,
but it's too little too late.

1075
01:24:40.858 --> 01:24:43.592
<i>What we need is to get
all the other nations online</i>

1076
01:24:43.594 --> 01:24:45.594
<i>before one starts global war.</i>

1077
01:24:45.596 --> 01:24:47.596
<i>And there's no way
for us to reach them.</i>

1078
01:24:47.598 --> 01:24:50.666
Okay, hold on a second.
There is!

1079
01:24:50.668 --> 01:24:52.335
It's right above us.

1080
01:24:53.904 --> 01:24:55.671
That's problematic
for us right now.

1081
01:24:55.673 --> 01:24:58.808
The Pentagon's convinced
our shell will retaliate.

1082
01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:02.011
My guess is they'll order us
to evacuate within the hour.

1083
01:25:02.013 --> 01:25:03.879
Look,
they're not our enemy.

1084
01:25:03.881 --> 01:25:06.015
They've made no act of
aggression towards us.

1085
01:25:06.017 --> 01:25:08.351
Maybe this is
their way of being aggressive.

1086
01:25:08.353 --> 01:25:09.785
That's not
the question.

1087
01:25:09.787 --> 01:25:11.520
What is the question?

1088
01:25:11.522 --> 01:25:13.789
How do we get you
back in that room

1089
01:25:13.791 --> 01:25:15.558
when it's half a mile
straight up?

1090
01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.426
I think
our work here is done.

1091
01:25:18.528 --> 01:25:21.430
It's in the hands
of our superiors now.

1092
01:25:40.817 --> 01:25:43.018
What the hell
is she doing?

1093
01:26:35.872 --> 01:26:38.874
Oh, my god! Oh, god, no!

1094
01:28:59.683 --> 01:29:01.317
Costello...

1095
01:29:03.853 --> 01:29:05.821
Where's abbott?

1096
01:29:35.151 --> 01:29:36.952
I'm sorry.

1097
01:29:39.022 --> 01:29:41.123
We're sorry.

1098
01:29:44.761 --> 01:29:47.129
I need you to...

1099
01:29:47.131 --> 01:29:51.400
I need you to send a message
to the other sites.

1100
01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:12.054
I don't...

1101
01:30:12.056 --> 01:30:14.156
I don't understand.

1102
01:30:14.158 --> 01:30:18.260
What is your purpose here?

1103
01:30:44.688 --> 01:30:47.189
How can you
know the future?

1104
01:31:02.972 --> 01:31:05.274
I don't...

1105
01:31:06.876 --> 01:31:10.913
I don't understand.
Who is this child?

1106
01:31:15.952 --> 01:31:17.786
<i>The show is called</i>

1107
01:31:17.788 --> 01:31:20.222
<i>"mommy and daddy
talk to animals."</i>

1108
01:31:53.757 --> 01:31:57.126
Wait! No! Wait!

1109
01:32:46.109 --> 01:32:47.876
- Dr. banks!
- Louise!

1110
01:32:47.878 --> 01:32:49.478
Are you all right?

1111
01:32:52.448 --> 01:32:54.483
You all right?
Yeah. I'm all right.

1112
01:32:54.485 --> 01:32:56.084
What happened?

1113
01:32:56.086 --> 01:32:58.387
I'm trying to figure it out.
This is too big.

1114
01:32:58.389 --> 01:33:01.056
Doesn't matter now.
We have orders to evacuate.

1115
01:33:01.058 --> 01:33:02.257
Why?

1116
01:33:02.259 --> 01:33:04.393
Russia and Sudan
are following China.

1117
01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:08.463
I don't understand.

1118
01:33:08.465 --> 01:33:09.865
<i>Help me, mama.</i>

1119
01:33:10.834 --> 01:33:13.368
Louise?
Whoa!

1120
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:14.469
Mom!

1121
01:33:17.273 --> 01:33:18.941
Mama!

1122
01:33:21.211 --> 01:33:23.278
Sorry, honey.

1123
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:28.417
What day is it?
Do you know, baby?

1124
01:33:28.419 --> 01:33:30.252
Sunday.

1125
01:33:35.491 --> 01:33:38.894
Are you gonna leave me
like daddy did?

1126
01:33:38.896 --> 01:33:42.431
Oh, Hannah, honey,
your daddy didn't leave you.

1127
01:33:42.433 --> 01:33:44.533
You're gonna
see him this weekend.

1128
01:33:45.969 --> 01:33:49.104
He doesn't look at me
the same way anymore.

1129
01:33:57.013 --> 01:33:59.047
It's my fault.

1130
01:34:00.950 --> 01:34:04.186
I told him something that
he wasn't ready to hear.

1131
01:34:05.989 --> 01:34:07.589
What?

1132
01:34:09.459 --> 01:34:11.393
Well...

1133
01:34:11.395 --> 01:34:13.896
Believe it or not,

1134
01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:16.498
I know something
that's going to happen.

1135
01:34:18.534 --> 01:34:21.303
I can't explain how I know.
I just do.

1136
01:34:22.939 --> 01:34:26.208
And when I told your daddy,
he got really mad.

1137
01:34:27.911 --> 01:34:30.445
And he said I made
the wrong choice.

1138
01:34:32.982 --> 01:34:36.151
What?
What's going to happen?

1139
01:34:38.588 --> 01:34:43.025
It has to do with
a really rare disease.

1140
01:34:45.628 --> 01:34:48.130
And it's unstoppable.

1141
01:34:49.499 --> 01:34:52.234
Kind of like you are,

1142
01:34:52.236 --> 01:34:56.004
with your swimming
and your poetry

1143
01:34:56.006 --> 01:34:57.572
and all the other
amazing things

1144
01:34:57.574 --> 01:34:59.441
that you share
with the world.

1145
01:34:59.443 --> 01:35:01.143
I'm unstoppable?

1146
01:35:02.078 --> 01:35:03.712
Yeah.

1147
01:35:20.097 --> 01:35:21.663
I got you.

1148
01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.501
Louise? Louise?

1149
01:35:28.404 --> 01:35:31.206
I just realized why
my husband left me.

1150
01:35:31.208 --> 01:35:33.108
My husband left me.

1151
01:35:33.110 --> 01:35:34.376
You were married?

1152
01:35:34.378 --> 01:35:37.312
Come on!
Let's get out of here.

1153
01:36:11.314 --> 01:36:12.714
Mama?

1154
01:36:12.716 --> 01:36:14.316
Yeah?

1155
01:36:14.318 --> 01:36:17.019
Why's my name
Hannah?

1156
01:36:18.722 --> 01:36:21.690
Get those people
back, please.

1157
01:36:21.692 --> 01:36:24.559
Well, your name
is very special,

1158
01:36:24.561 --> 01:36:27.162
because it is
a palindrome.

1159
01:36:27.164 --> 01:36:30.699
It reads the same forward
and backward.

1160
01:36:30.701 --> 01:36:33.301
All right, guys,
give me a hand here.

1161
01:36:33.303 --> 01:36:35.303
Yes, sir.
That goes in the bag.

1162
01:36:39.575 --> 01:36:41.309
Ready to go!

1163
01:37:00.730 --> 01:37:03.799
<i>Evacuation underway.</i>

1164
01:37:07.170 --> 01:37:08.336
<i>Hey...</i>

1165
01:37:08.338 --> 01:37:12.407
We're done here!
We're taking this with us.

1166
01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:38.366
I can read it.

1167
01:37:42.705 --> 01:37:44.706
I know what it is.
What?

1168
01:37:44.708 --> 01:37:47.375
It's not a weapon.
It's a gift.

1169
01:37:47.377 --> 01:37:49.377
The weapon is
their language.

1170
01:37:49.379 --> 01:37:51.646
They gave it to us.
Do you know what that means?

1171
01:37:51.648 --> 01:37:54.783
So we can learn heptapod.
If we survive.

1172
01:37:54.785 --> 01:37:57.586
If you learn it,
when you really learn it,

1173
01:37:57.588 --> 01:38:00.122
you begin to perceive time
the way that they do,

1174
01:38:00.124 --> 01:38:03.258
so you can see
what's to come.

1175
01:38:03.260 --> 01:38:05.327
But time, it isn't
the same for them.

1176
01:38:05.329 --> 01:38:07.596
It's non-linear.

1177
01:38:07.598 --> 01:38:10.332
Look, we did our best,
but it wasn't enough.

1178
01:38:11.467 --> 01:38:13.268
The captain
will load you up.

1179
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:14.636
You're lifting off
in 5 minutes.

1180
01:38:14.638 --> 01:38:18.807
Ian, Louise, it was
an honor to work with you.

1181
01:38:18.809 --> 01:38:20.876
Good luck.

1182
01:38:24.514 --> 01:38:26.414
Hey, colonel...

1183
01:38:32.755 --> 01:38:35.357
I'm gonna find out
where we're going.

1184
01:38:42.698 --> 01:38:44.833
Wake up, mommy!

1185
01:39:20.436 --> 01:39:22.270
Dr. banks...

1186
01:39:23.339 --> 01:39:25.373
A pleasure.

1187
01:39:25.375 --> 01:39:28.743
General shang,
the pleasure is mine, really.

1188
01:39:28.745 --> 01:39:30.879
Your president said

1189
01:39:30.881 --> 01:39:34.316
he was honored to host me
at the celebration...

1190
01:39:34.318 --> 01:39:35.917
Yeah.

1191
01:39:35.919 --> 01:39:39.221
...but I confess,
the only reason why I'm here

1192
01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:42.791
is to meet you in person.

1193
01:39:44.227 --> 01:39:47.329
Me? Well, I'm flattered.
Thank you.

1194
01:39:47.697 --> 01:39:50.265
18 months ago,

1195
01:39:50.267 --> 01:39:52.801
you did something remarkable,

1196
01:39:52.803 --> 01:39:56.871
something not even
my superior has done.

1197
01:39:58.307 --> 01:39:59.908
And what's that?

1198
01:39:59.910 --> 01:40:01.710
You changed my mind.

1199
01:40:03.779 --> 01:40:07.983
You're the reason
for this unification,

1200
01:40:08.517 --> 01:40:12.520
all because you reached out
to me at my private number.

1201
01:40:14.457 --> 01:40:16.725
Your private number?

1202
01:40:16.727 --> 01:40:19.294
General, I... I don't know
your private number.

1203
01:40:25.401 --> 01:40:27.035
Now you know.

1204
01:40:28.571 --> 01:40:31.840
I do not claim to know
how your mind works,

1205
01:40:31.842 --> 01:40:36.678
but I believe it was important
for you to see that.

1206
01:40:38.447 --> 01:40:40.315
I called you, didn't I?

1207
01:40:41.384 --> 01:40:43.718
Yes, you did.

1208
01:40:54.497 --> 01:40:56.064
Louise!

1209
01:41:12.381 --> 01:41:15.450
All right,
let's shut down the system.

1210
01:41:15.452 --> 01:41:18.853
Sir? There's a sat line
here dialing China.

1211
01:41:20.690 --> 01:41:22.724
Here? What do
you mean "here"?

1212
01:41:24.827 --> 01:41:27.495
Come on, come on!

1213
01:41:27.497 --> 01:41:29.364
Whose phone is it?

1214
01:41:33.469 --> 01:41:34.836
It's your phone, sir.

1215
01:41:42.011 --> 01:41:43.678
Search base camp now.

1216
01:41:43.680 --> 01:41:45.947
Find out
who's using that phone.

1217
01:41:45.949 --> 01:41:47.782
And hold on to
those coordinates.

1218
01:41:47.784 --> 01:41:48.950
Yes, sir.

1219
01:41:48.952 --> 01:41:51.419
Come on... what do I say?

1220
01:41:52.355 --> 01:41:53.922
What do I say?

1221
01:42:04.734 --> 01:42:06.434
Come on.

1222
01:42:06.902 --> 01:42:09.971
I will never forget
what you said.

1223
01:42:20.649 --> 01:42:24.486
You told me
my wife's dying words.

1224
01:42:41.036 --> 01:42:42.904
We found the source
of the phone call.

1225
01:42:42.906 --> 01:42:44.839
It's in the clean room.
We're waiting for instructions.

1226
01:42:48.078 --> 01:42:49.978
What are you doing?

1227
01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:52.113
What are you doing?
Changing someone's mind.

1228
01:42:52.115 --> 01:42:54.115
Can you buy me 20 seconds?
We don't have time for this.

1229
01:42:54.117 --> 01:42:55.717
No, trust me.
Buy me 20 seconds.

1230
01:42:55.719 --> 01:42:57.819
Do you trust me?
Okay. Yeah.

1231
01:43:00.956 --> 01:43:04.726
Dr. banks, drop the phone
now or we shoot!

1232
01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:09.130
Drop it!

1233
01:43:09.132 --> 01:43:10.498
I'm sorry!

1234
01:43:11.968 --> 01:43:14.903
You are committing
an act of treason!

1235
01:43:19.909 --> 01:43:22.010
Yes.
Drop it!

1236
01:43:22.012 --> 01:43:23.778
It's done. I'm done.

1237
01:43:39.462 --> 01:43:41.930
<i>...blackout from

01:44:04.654 --> 01:44:06.187

1257
01:46:08.277 --> 01:46:10.812
<i>So, Hannah,</i>

1258
01:46:12.181 --> 01:46:14.983
<i>this is where
your story begins.</i>

1259
01:46:16.919 --> 01:46:19.087
<i>The day they departed.</i>

1260
01:46:23.025 --> 01:46:24.726
You all right?

1261
01:46:27.796 --> 01:46:32.367
<i>Despite knowing the journey
and where it leads,</i>

1262
01:46:35.170 --> 01:46:37.238
<i>I embrace it.</i>

1263
01:46:39.041 --> 01:46:42.710
<i>And I welcome
every moment of it.</i>

1264
01:46:43.646 --> 01:46:46.781
Ooh! Ah! Ooh!

1265
01:46:57.326 --> 01:47:01.996
H-a-n-n-a-h.

1266
01:47:15.811 --> 01:47:18.813
Now backward. H...

1267
01:47:18.815 --> 01:47:21.149
...a-n-n-a-h!

1268
01:47:21.151 --> 01:47:22.717
Hannah!

1269
01:47:22.719 --> 01:47:24.819
You ready, baby?

1270
01:47:27.356 --> 01:47:29.023
Hi!

1271
01:47:31.394 --> 01:47:33.761
Don't worry. See you.

1272
01:47:35.130 --> 01:47:36.798
Daddy!

1273
01:47:45.908 --> 01:47:47.375
You okay?

1274
01:47:51.914 --> 01:47:53.781
Are you ready?

1275
01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:58.953
Oh, guess what? Star stuff!

1276
01:48:01.390 --> 01:48:02.824
Ian?

1277
01:48:02.924 --> 01:48:03.826
Yeah?

1278
01:48:04.326 --> 01:48:07.795
If you could see your whole
life from start to finish,

1279
01:48:09.865 --> 01:48:11.966
would you change things?

1280
01:48:18.006 --> 01:48:22.076
Maybe I'd say
what I feel more often.

1281
01:48:22.078 --> 01:48:23.811
I... I don't know.

1282
01:48:39.228 --> 01:48:41.929
You know, I've had my head
tilted up to the stars

1283
01:48:41.931 --> 01:48:43.498
for as long as
i can remember.

1284
01:48:46.034 --> 01:48:48.503
You know what
surprised me the most?

1285
01:48:50.305 --> 01:48:52.440
It wasn't meeting them.

1286
01:48:57.179 --> 01:48:59.447
It was meeting you.

1287
01:49:39.354 --> 01:49:43.291
I forgot how good it felt
to be held by you.

1288
01:49:52.267 --> 01:49:54.335
You wanna make a baby?

1289
01:50:28.503 --> 01:50:31.272
Yes. Yeah.
