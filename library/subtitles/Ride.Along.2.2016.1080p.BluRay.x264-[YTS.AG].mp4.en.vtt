Let me ask you
a serious question.

00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:41.205
Maybe you not
cut out for this.

00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.248
That's not a question.
That's a statement.

00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:45.971
You know what? You was having such a
good time at your bachelor party,

00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:47.041
you wasn't even ready.

00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:48.121
Okay, James,
first of all,

00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:49.440
don't act like I wanted
to go to this club,

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:52.171
and stand on tables, and party
with a bunch of hot women.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:55.003
That didn't come out right.
So, I'm gonna start over.

Well, I'll tell you what's not
going on, a Pilates class.

I dunno what you're dressed
for, but it's stupid.

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.241
What happened?

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:17.405
One shooter. Obviously a professional.
Went right after AJ.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.527
Who the hell is AJ?

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.001
AJ's the hacker that we
came out here to question.

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:23.447
Now, your guys think
it's gang related.

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:24.806
I say that's bullshit.

00:40:24.880 --> 00:40:26.530
Because you're
an expert on local gangs?

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.250
No, I'm an expert
on bullshit.

00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:30.283
Well, expert,
how'd he get the gun in?

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.361
Gun was ceramic.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:34.481
Or plastic. I saw it.
It was a FN 5.7.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.441
It's undetectable. It's a downloadable
super pack in my video game.

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:40.842
Let me tell you something, you get
that pack, game over! Okay...

00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.844
That's how he got the gun in.

00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.085
The case I'm
working on right now,

00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.049
shooter got a gun
inside of a secured area.

00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.360
And get this,

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.443
the threads on the bullet matched
the casings of an FN 5.7.

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.522
Same M.O. Could be
the same shooter.

00:40:56.640 --> 00:40:58.210
Who was shot?
Port Commissioner.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.045
Could be connected.
Could be connected.

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.124
Ugh. It's like
watching rams mate.

00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:08.283
Why would somebody hire
a professional hitman

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.323
to take out a computer guy

00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.164
for a mid-level Atlanta dealer?

00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.361
Because he's annoying.

00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:16.091
If that was the case, you'd
be dead a long time ago.

00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.201
I'm just spit-balling.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.611
Fact is, he wouldn't.

00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.011
So, the guy who hit
the Port Commissioner

00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.726
is the same guy who
tried to hit your hacker.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.802
Maybe he's involved
with something bigger.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.001

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:28.889

"plus one" for the wedding.

You know what?
You should get in the car.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.489
I need to get somebody for you.
You need to get in the car.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.367
because the first name I
came across was Colette.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.487
I said, "Who is Colette?"

00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.210
More importantly,
"What's her ringtone?"

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.645

why are the Atlanta police

Well, we thought that you might
have a problem with theft.

an embezzlement

Don't remember
reporting it, though.

01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.763
I'm guessing that you
found the culprit.

a few of my city official
friends in Atlanta

01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.091
won't be too happy to learn

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.640
that one of their benefactors
is being harassed.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.085

It is true that one of you might
just receive a reprimand.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.846
But what if one of you is still
on his probationary period?

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.645
That particular officer,
he could be eliminated.

Listen, all I know is that I'm a
victim of a hacker who stole from me.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.406
I don't even want
to have him arrested.

01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.885

figure out how he got in,

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.564

from happening again.

01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.647
I'm worried that my

So, if you are
not here to help,

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.881
why did you come?

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.405
I heard you had
a Gucci toilet.

01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.524
I think we're done here.

you want to come

to erase on his big solar project.

tells that guy

shipments alone.

Why would he wanna hide
shipments of solar panels?

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.084
Because it's not solar panels.

Open it up!

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.207
All right, Ben, let me
know what we got, partner.

01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:07.964
Is it my birthday?

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.441
No!

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.891
Okay, it must be Christmas!

01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:12.881
What we got?

We had good intel.

01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:27.921
It was an unregistered,
off-the-books shipment.

01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.490
It was a clerical error.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.688

Mr. Pope, let me apologize.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:39.251
See, I don't get it.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:42.091
I've tried to be nice.
I've tried to be cool.

01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:45.369
Did I press charges when you
three crashed my party? No.

01:17:45.880 --> 01:17:46.847
But, now...

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:49.446
See, now, I'm pissed.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:52.086
I have a reputation to protect.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.927
This is gonna come out weird,

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:57.004
but I'm really, really rich.

01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:58.764
I mean, I make sick money.

01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:01.320

that money buys me?

begun to make calls

It's kind of hard to
think of any outcome

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.764
