everyone to Table Five,

overshadowing your wedding.

Perfect. Table Five,
that's the perfect table.

them right there.

ignored them all, Cori.

you a question.

358
00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:17.362
Have you looked at my Dreamboard
that I posted online?

359

Okay. And I got
a vision for my wedding.

And everybody on

510

But he thinks if he makes
this Miami run with me,

that he'll prove us all wrong.

512

So, I'm taking him,
so he can see for himself.

513

letting them know you in town.

If we're gonna be a team, you
gotta start to coordinate.

Listen to me, James!

Or plastic. I saw it.
It was a FN 5.7.

961

And get this,

967
00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.443
the threads on the bullet matched
the casings of an FN 5.7.

968
00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.522

the same shooter.

Fact is, he wouldn't.

979
00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.011
So, the guy who hit
the Port Commissioner

980
00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.726
is the same guy who
tried to hit your hacker.

981
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:24.802

with something bigger.

It's a little too much.

Tasha...

1147
00:47:05.560 --> 00:47:08.040
James may not understand
what you're saying, but I do.

1148
00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:09.884
I mean, you and AJ
obviously have a connection,

1149
00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.962
and you're trying to
honor him right now.

1150
00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.280
Right, James?

1151
00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:16.409
My question to everyone
standing here is,

1152
00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:18.809
is he honoring you,Tasha?

1153
00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.530
Because when I went through
this phone, here...

1154
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:21.567
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1155
00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:22.641
I was kinda thrown off

1156
00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:24.529
by what was going on
in the contact list.

1157
00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:25.931
Especially Favorites,

1158
00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:28.367
because the first name I
came across was Colette.

1159
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:29.487
I said, "Who is Colette?"

1160
00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:31.210
More importantly,
"What's her ringtone?"

1161
00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:32.645
So I played it.

'Cause it's hyper-sexual.

What's that

1166

So I said, "Maybe
that's the only one."

1167
00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:43.884
But then right underneath
it, I see "Bree."

1168
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:46.440
Bree? Yeah. Who is that?
What's her ringtone?

1169
00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:47.806

00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.045

It's true.

Well, disregard that.

1176
00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.889
So, then I started
thinking about you.

1177
00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.803
You're priority.
At least, I thought you were.

1178

But, then, I see your name
at the bottom of the list.

1179
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.408
So, I said, "Maybe he
saved the best for last."

1180
00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:08.891
Then I played
your ringtone, Tasha.

No. It's gator-free

just get to the desk quietly.

that he inputted himself,

Does that surprise you?

1721
01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:35.881
Perhaps the bigger
question is,

1722
01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.890
why are the Atlanta police
crashing my party?

1723
01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:42.362
Well, we thought that you might
have a problem with theft.

1724

Now that you
mention it, I did have

1725
01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.282
an embezzlement
issue this week.

1726
01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.761
Don't remember
reporting it, though.

1727
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.763
I'm guessing that you
found the culprit.

1728
01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:53.921
Hmm?

1729
01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.650
Oh, you douchebag.

1730
01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.210
I think you know
who took from me.

1731
01:10:57.280 --> 01:10:59.647
And if I don't get
some answers soon,

1732
01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:01.688
a few of my city official
friends in Atlanta

1733
01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.091
won't be too happy to learn

1734
01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.640
that one of their benefactors
is being harassed.

1735
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:07.085
In his own home, no less.

1736
01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.440
What, you gonna
snitch on us?

1737
01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.681
Do you think we care?

1738
01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.969
It is true that one of you might
just receive a reprimand.

1739
01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:16.846
But what if one of you is still
on his probationary period?

1740
01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.645
That particular officer,
he could be eliminated.

1741
01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:22.689
- Just like that.

the unemployment rate

1747
01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:34.082
Listen, all I know is that I'm a
victim of a hacker who stole from me.

1748
01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:35.406
I don't even want
to have him arrested.

1749
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.885
I just want to
figure out how he got in,

1750
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.564
so I can prevent it
from happening again.

1751
01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:42.647
I'm worried that my
charities are vulnerable.

1752
01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:45.402
So, if you are
not here to help,

1753
01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:46.881
why did you come?

1754
01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.405
I heard you had
a Gucci toilet.

1755
01:11:52.920 --> 01:11:54.524
I think we're done here.

1756
01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.485
My men will show you out.

1757
01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:58.724
And the next time
you want to come

1758
01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:01.007

1759

1761
01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:10.331
Now, I'm feeding
these people sliders,

01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:13.722

I don't want to be having?

1763
01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:15.565

going to shoot you.

1764

to make my point.

1772
01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.725

1773
01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:43.724
I just don't want to
get blood on my pants.

1774
01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.651
Okay, I found a discussion he tried
to erase on his big solar project.

1775
01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.366
Looks like Pope orders his guy

1776
01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:53.727
to delete certain shipments
from the manifest.

1777
01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:55.848
But he specifically
tells that guy

1778
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.081
to leave other
shipments alone.

1779
01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.322
Why would he wanna hide
shipments of solar panels?

1780
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.084
Because it's not solar panels.

1781
01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:04.811
He's got one of them hidden
shipments arriving tomorrow.

1782
01:13:04.880 --> 01:13:06.530
<font color="#808080">JAMES:</font> We need to find out
what's in that shipment.

1783
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:07.681
Wait.

1784
01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.966
Does that mean
what I think it means?

1785
01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:10.885
<font color="#808080">BEN:</font> We are on a stakeout!

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:15.604
You know, I think I really
proved myself this trip.

1788
01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:18.362
And, I guarantee you, James, that
truck gonna be full of drugs.

1789
01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:19.601
All right, man, slow down.

1790
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.651
If the Port Commissioner wasn't
cooperating, it could be a problem.

1791
01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.006
One to kill for.

1792
01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:27.970
He tried to cooperate, but
Pope still killed him anyway.

1793
01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.688
How do you know that?
I was there, on Pope's yacht.

1794
01:13:30.800 --> 01:13:32.006
When I told you to tell me
everything you know,

1795
01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.003
why you didn't tell me
everything you knew?

1796

1961
01:20:44.360 --> 01:20:46.442
I was just thinking about the
Port Commissioner's replacement.

1962
01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.761
It's weird how he showed up on
the bridge right after Pope.

1963
01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.841
So?

1964
01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.365
You don't kill
the Port Commissioner

1965
01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.090
if you don't control
the replacement.

1966

Look, if Nunez is in on it,

1970
01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.211
that means Pope is moving
contraband through the port.

1971
01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.169
Nunez? Charlie Nunez?

1972

Ben, I like this.

2284
01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:09.926
Before we go, let's loop
back around one more time!

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.445
I'mma show them what
we capable of, baby!

2286
01:36:11.520 --> 01:36:12.646
You could slow down
a little bit.

2287
01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.006
You ain't got nothing
to worry about!

2288
01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:15.121
You with the Black Hammer!

2289
01:36:15.200 --> 01:36:16.167
I'm just gonna get
a little more speed!

2290
01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:17.924
There's a boat
right in front of us.

2291
01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.041
I know how to
drive this boat!

2292
01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:20.281
That's the first thing
they teach you.
