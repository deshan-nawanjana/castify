00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.805
<i>I work in Human Resources
or "HR," as some people call it.</i>

3
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.326
<i>And I have this poster
in my office that says,</i>

4
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.971
<i>"Keep calm and go to your safe place."</i>

5
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.161
<i>Well, when I get a little stressed out
or my anxiety spikes,</i>

6
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.971
<i>I close my eyes
and picture my cul-de-sac,</i>

7
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.125
<i>and my wonderful wife, Karen,
and our two sons, Patrick and Mikey.</i>

8
00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.000
<i>Because that's the place where I know
everything is always okay.</i>

9
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.486
<i>No matter what.</i>

10
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.411
<i>Bye, Mikey, Patrick.
Bye, you guys.</i>

11
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.601
<i>Bye, guys.</i>

12
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.045
You can text us
the minute you get to camp.

13
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.207
Yeah, okay.

14
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.089
And if you get any ticks,
put it in the plastic baggie

15
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.289
with the date and time of the bite,
and I'll get them tested.

16
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.806
Change your socks. Okay, guys?
Change your socks.

17
00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.331
We love you. We love you.
We're gonna miss you.

18
00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.970
- Love you guys!
- Have so much fun!

19
00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.041
Be strong!

20
00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.081
Be strong.

21
00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.804
Oh.

22
00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.082
Did that bus driver
look sober to you, honey?

23
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.891
Because he gave me a really weird look
when I smelled his breath.

24
00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.803
Well, I think you just startled him.

25
00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.645
Huh! Look, there's Meg.

26
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.767
Hey, Meg.

27
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.608
- Whoo! I sold it.
- Oh!

28
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.728
- That was so fast.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.040
All cash buyers.

30
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.565
All cash buyers? That's fancy.

31
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.450
Yeah. And the best part is,
they didn't even see it.

32
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.170
They just saw the pictures online.

33
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.481
I haven't even met them
in person. It's crazy.

34
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.291
Who buys a house
without seeing it first?

35
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.601
I know. Maybe it's a celebrity,
you know?

36
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.160
Come on, Jeff.
No celebrity is gonna move here.

37
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.891
I hope it's not some kind of
meth lab situation.

38
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.006
Oh. There he is.

39
00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.242
- Sorry.
- Where have you been?

40
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.003
Kinko's was bananas.

41
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.320
It often is.

42
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.845
- Hey.
- Hey.

43
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.729
So exciting. New neighbors, right?

44
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.246
Oh, and, Karen,
I left your card in the foyer,

45
00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.561
- just in case they want a decorator.
- Thank you.

46
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.760
So, uh, did you tell

47
00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.645
Jeff about my new idea
for the guest bathroom?

48
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.445
No.

49
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.204
Artist's loft.

50
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.044
Think Brooklyn, okay?

51
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.970
Exposed brick,
visible plumbing. And...

52
00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:07.441
A urinal.

53
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.050
A urinal!

54
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.124
That's really for me.
Meg wants me standing up again.

55
00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.404
Well, I suppose I'd better get started
on the urinal.

56
00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.689
Yeah, no. I know
what you're getting started on.

57
00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.842
Empty house, kids are gone.

58
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.365
Wow-chick-a-wow-wow!

59
00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.441
Please.

60
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.325
- Honeymoon.
- All right, keep it PG, guys.

61
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.244
Well, we gotta go
flyer the subdivision anyway.

62
00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.085
- We're gonna pound the pavement.
- Yeah.

63
00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.483
- Jeff, you should try it hyena style.
- We'll try it.

64
00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.090
That's the noise I make.

65
00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.725
I think Meg has changed up
her medication, honey.

66
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.484
- What's Dan's excuse then?
- Ugh.

67
00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.804
Some of that stuff
they were saying was demented.

68
00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.370
- Disgusting.
- Yeah.

69
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.001
Phew!

70
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.447
But maybe they have a point.
I don't know.

71
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:00.921
Alone in the house.

72
00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:03.765
First time in a long time.

73
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.328

Great. I'll make popcorn.

86
00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.362
- Back it up.
- You got it.

87
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.522
- How much room we got?
- Almost there.

88
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.840
Hey, Bernie.

89
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.002
New neighbors aren't wasting
any time moving in, are they?

90
00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.527
Nope.

91
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.531
You're gonna clean that up,
right, Berno?

92
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.681
Always do.

93
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.683
Okay, have a good one.

94
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.365
Come on, guys. Let's get outta here.

95
00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.010
Come on, fellas. Let's go. Come on.

96
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.606
Hi, Jack. Good morning.

97
00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.921
Don't let anybody say that to you
on a plane. "Hijack."

98
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.201
Good morning, anyway.

99
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.327
Morning.

100
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.567
Hi, Diane.

101
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.005
Jeff, good morning.

102
00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:46.641
See those moving vans?

103
00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.484
Oh. Couldn't miss them.

104
00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.766
- Gosh!
- So,

105
00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.888
- any word on the new neighbors?
- No.

106
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.121
- Anything?
- Nothing.

107
00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.804
Guarantee they're no Dave and Bridget.

108
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.962
Well, at least the summer's
not a total loss.

109
00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.008
I mean, we got Junetoberfest
to look forward to.

110
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.570
- Yes, we do.
- And our jobs.

111
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.926
Always have our jobs.

112
00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.490
By the way, how's it going upstairs?

113
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.563
Jesus, Jeff. You know I can't
talk about what we do upstairs.

114
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.130
Yeah. I know. It's all right.

115
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.645
Uh... Hey, oh, by the way,

116
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.404
I still have those, uh,
indoor skydiving

117
00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.970
lessons if you wanna join me.

118
00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.400
My treat.

119
00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:18.810
Uh, this week's really hectic.
Kid stuff. But, maybe.

120
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:20.450
Just text me. Or I'll text you.

121
00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.642
Okay, we'll talk about it later.
Have a good one.

122
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.846
- All right.
- Hey, Sheila. Good morning.

123
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.801
Morning, Louise.

124
00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.600
Morning, Sharon.

125
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.523
Hi, Jeff. Dr. Fisher called.

126
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.647
Yeah? What did he say?

127
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.486
He said, "Please tell Jeff to stop
texting me about indoor skydiving."

128
00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.643
He's joking. He's a riot. Hey, Doug.

129
00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.167
Hey, Sanjay.

130
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.925
Hey, uh, Jeff.
Can I use your computer?

131
00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.729
I need to reorder my anti-depressants.

132
00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:55.684
Of course. <i>Mi computer, su computer.</i>

133
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.205
Where are you? Who's that?

134
00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.765
Oh, this is Jeff.

135
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.122
Jeff lets me use his computer because
security prohibits Internet upstairs.

136
00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.649
And why does Jeff have Internet?

137
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:10.411
Because Jeff does unimportant work.

138
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:12.769
Human Resources.

139
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.411
Are we getting written up?
'Cause I emailed him last night

140
00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:18.285
and apologized.
He said he was fine. And we have

141
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.647
- put this behind us.
- It's all fine.

142
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.447
I wouldn't be doing my job if we
didn't go over a couple of exercises.

143
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.841
So, grab a stress ball.

144
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.527
Really?

145
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:30.762
Okay, so, Margaret's gonna
show us, uh...

146
00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.410
the, uh, meaning of trust.

147
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.328
- Hey, Sanjay?
- Yeah?

148
00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.404
Did I tell you that I ate at
a Indian restaurant the other night?

149
00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.971
Yeah, I had to call
and make an Indian reservation.

150
00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.530
Yang, tell Oren how he makes you feel.

151
00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.800
Maybe you should just write us up.
That might be easier.

152
00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.009
I once knew an Indian who drank
so much tea, he died in his "tea-pee."

153
00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:58.521
That was a good one.

154
00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.250
Okay, Margaret. Go ahead.

155
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:51.766
Wow.

156
00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.767
Yes, I do feel
like you are jealous.

157
00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.365
I can sense the resentment

158
00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.444
every time I bring up
gravitational perturbations.

159
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.409
Is that bad? That sounds bad.
What is that? Is that like, uh...

160
00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:04.290
Gravitational perturbations?
That's a laugh!

161
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.931
Plus, what about my work?

162
00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.081
I mentioned velocity vectors
one time...

163
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.121
One time,

164
00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.362
and you try to get me
bumped down to Dhameer's team?

165
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.488
You were supposed
to calculate...

166
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.801
This is all because
I hooked up with Sharada.

167
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:23.928
You what?
You hooked up with Sharada Ganjali?

168
00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.644
I'll kill you!

169
00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:31.410
Oren, this is no way
to settle a workplace dispute!

170
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.925
Sharon, call security!

171
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.161
Hiya, Jeff!

172
00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.364
- Karen.
- Hey, honey!

173
00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.765
Hey, darling.

174
00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.051
Still spying on the neighbors?

175
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.771
Hi, there.

176
00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:55.161
Hello.

177
00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:57.927
You must be Jeff.

178
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.970
I'm Tim. This is my wife, Natalie.

179
00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.123
We're the Joneses!
Nice to meet you, Jeff.

180
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.407
Nice to meet you guys.
Uh, that was a joke about spying...

181
00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.881
It's a joke. I'd never spy on anyone.

182
00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.365
We love humor.

183
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.567
Humor...

184
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:16.490
So, Natalie was just telling me that
she's a social media consultant.

185
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.449
Yeah. I also write a cooking blog.

186
00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:19.931
Oh, I love blogs.

187
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.810
Yeah, and I work with a charity
for Sri Lankan orphans.

188
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.601
Those are my biggest passions.

189
00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.841
Natalie's got a big heart.

190
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.524
Aw, thank you, baby.

191
00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.646
Yeah, um...

192
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.850
- Why don't you tell them about, uh...
- What?

193
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.446
She has passions too. Why don't you
tell them about the urinal?

194
00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.047
No, honey!

195
00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.321
It's nothing.

196
00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:40.640
Oh, no, please. It sounds interesting.

197
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:44.448
I'm picking up a slight accent.
Is that Pittsburgh, maybe?

198
00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.761
- She's from Greece.
- Oh, God.

199
00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:48.205
No, but we've lived all over.

200
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:51.648
And now, it's finally time
to plant some roots. Right?

201
00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:52.921
Oh...

202
00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.846
I can't tell you how excited we are
to be here on Maple Circle.

203
00:10:56.920 --> 00:10:58.081
Such a lovely street.

204
00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.241
- It really is.
- Oh.

205
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.731
- Thank you.
- We love it.

206
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.451
It's fascinating. In other cultures,
they don't have anything like this.

207
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.726
No, they don't.

208
00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.040
In Chinese, for example.

209
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.724
They don't even have a word
for a street like this.

210
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.926
What? For cul-de-sac?

211
00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.968
No. No. I mean, they would say...

212
00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.410
Which is, loosely,

213
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:16.403
- "happy place of heart and mind."
- Right.

214
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.086
But it doesn't really capture
the essence of it, right?

215
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:20.730
But it's cool coming
out of your mouth.

216
00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.042
- Tim's a travel writer.
- Oh! Really?

217
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.969
- Wow! We love to travel.
- We do.

218
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:29.448
Yeah. We went to Epcot Center
last summer, was it? Yeah.

219
00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:32.524
You can go to every country,
like, within three blocks.

220
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.364
Perfect. That's what we like about it.

221
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.566
We went with the boys over there.

222
00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.449
That's Patrick and Mikey.
Patrick's leaning

223
00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.090
against the wheel.
He's just a real cuddler.

224
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.251
- They're beautiful.
- Adorable.

225
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.045
Mikey, uh, made this.

226
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.690
- Oh! Wow!
- What a talent!

227
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.844
- Speaking of which, we brought you...
- Yes, yes.

228
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.921
...a little something.

229
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:50.687
What?

230
00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.730
- That's amazing! Really?
- Give me a break!

231
00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.801
I made it myself.

232
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.121
- You made it yourself?
- Mmm-hmm.

233
00:11:58.360 --> 00:11:59.361
Oh...

234
00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.930
Wow. Look at this.

235
00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.126
- What is this?
- What is that?

236
00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:03.241
A sculpture.

237
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.685
Tim blows his own glass.

238
00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.569
Look at it in the light, honey.
It sort of...

239
00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:08.449
- That's gorgeous. Look at that.
- Gorgeous.

240
00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:09.681
- You made that?
- Yeah,

241
00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.250
it's a hobby I picked up in Hungary.

242
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.644
I wrote an article about this, uh,
Hungarian glass-blowing master, Yorgi.

243
00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:18.567
- Thank you. I don't know what to say.
- Oh, you don't need to say anything.

244
00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.850
Just put it right there
and use it as a conversation piece.

245
00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.843
- That's cool. Thank you very much!
- Thank you.

246
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:25.843
- Anyway, we should get going.
- Yeah.

247
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:27.889
- Yeah. We should.
- Oh. Okay.

248
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.042
Uh, I feel like I should
give you guys a gift.

249
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:31.360
I didn't know we were giving gifts.

250
00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.090
- That's not necessary.
- You want a stress ball?

251
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.525
No, you don't want a stress ball.
That would be stupid.

252
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.601
I'd love a stress ball.

253
00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.205
- Thank you.
- Yes! They really work.

254
00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.281
Thank you.

255
00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:40.368
- Let me just get this out of your way.
- No, Jeff will get that.

256
00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:41.680
- No, no, no.
- That's nice.

257
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.489
It's all good. We're neighbors now.

258
00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:45.046
All right.

259
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.131
Have you guys ever, uh, been to
or heard of, uh, Junetoberfest?

260
00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.929
- Junetoberfest?
- Yeah.

261
00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.451
You guys should really come.

262
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.522
It's our annual summer get-together.

263
00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.569
The whole neighborhood comes.
A really fun group.

264
00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.687
A lot of us work together.

265
00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.961
At MBI?

266
00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:03.641
Yeah. We have a dart tournament.
We have bratwurst.

267
00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:05.603
I make my own home brew,
which is my passion.

268
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.767
Good!

269
00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.205
How'd you know that Jeff works at MBI?

270
00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.281
Hmm?

271
00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:11.409
Jeff must've mentioned it.
Right, Jeff?

272
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.483
- No. No, he didn't.
- That's okay, honey...

273
00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.641
No, Jeff didn't mention it.

274
00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.441
The stress ball.

275
00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.806
Must've been a lucky guess,
I guess.

276
00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.326
- No, it's right there.
- Lucky guess. Yeah, we should go.

277
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.006
It's getting late.
Thank you so much for everything.

278
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.844
The coffee was delicious.

279
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.809
- Thank you.
- And we'll see you at Junetoberfest!

280
00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.762
So, let me show you a picture.
This is Tyler.

281
00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.842
And Tyler's gonna go
to asthma camp this summer.

282
00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:39.088
Oh, my God! He's so handsome!

283
00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.042
- Hiya, neighbor.
- Hey.

284
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:47.451
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

285
00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.885
"Seared yellowtail

286
00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.727
with lemon zest and ginger shavings."
Who the hell made this?

287
00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.246
Natalie. Apparently,
she can do everything.

288
00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.005
I'm sorry, but who wears that
to a barbecue?

289
00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.286
I mean, there are kids here.

290
00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.283
Come on, Meg.
It's just a summer dress.

291
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.920
It's a very short, very chic,
extremely flattering summer dress.

292
00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.684
Yeah, well, it's pornographic.

293
00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.329
Oh. Look at Dan pretending
to check his email.

294
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.528
If I find pictures of her ass
on his phone, BJ night is canceled.

295
00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:18.441
So, anyway, there I am,

296
00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.205
alone, in the middle
of the Empty Quarter, all by myself,

297
00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.886
with no water, dying of thirst.
I'm literally

298
00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.011
- writing a goodbye letter to Natalie.
- Oh.

299
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.162
And what do I see
coming up over the horizon?

300
00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.641
But the exact same camel...

301
00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.848
whose life I saved
three years earlier.

302
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:35.729
- Exact same one.
- Did he remember you?

303
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:37.962
No. No, Jeff.
He didn't remember me. He's a camel.

304
00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.687
But I was able to ride him
into civilization.

305
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:44.491
And I filed my story, with 15 minutes
to spare, thank you very much.

306
00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:45.641
Caught the next flight to Marrakesh

307
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.724
and was sitting in a café with Natalie
smoking hookah later that night.

308
00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.406
- No way!
- I wanna smoke a hookah in Marrakesh.

309
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.162
Well, Stacey,
I know it sounds very romantic.

310
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:58.006
But, trust me, the world can be
a very dark and disturbing place.

311
00:14:58.520 --> 00:14:59.567
Tim, you want a beer?

312
00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:01.005
Uh, sure. Yeah. Thank you.

313
00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.124
- Here you go.
- Ooh. There it is.

314
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.121
Mmm.

315
00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.481
Wow, good job... Ooh, ooh, ooh!
Buddy, buddy. Yeah, buddy. Wow!

316
00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:14.210
- That is a lot of blood.
- It's fine. It's okay.

317
00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:15.406
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

318
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:16.561
It's just gushing a bit.

319
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:17.721
- Just hold on to that.
- Yes.

320
00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:18.847
Give me this.

321
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:20.160
- It's sprung a leak.
- Just...

322
00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.288
- I feel a little bit light-headed.
- Close your hand around it.

323
00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:23.765
- If I could just maybe...
- No! No! no!

324
00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.400
You can't rattle me.

325
00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.811
Witness... Witness my destiny.

326
00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:33.564
Neighborhood champ,
five years in a row!

327
00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.049
Hey! You wanna give it a try?

328
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.167
- Me?
- Yeah!

329
00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.687
No,

330
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:41.330
- I'll only embarrass myself.
- "No" is not an answer.

331
00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.447
Come on. It's so easy.

332
00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.920
- It's a bad idea.
- Look,

333
00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.209
I'll even show you
the famous Craverston grip, okay?

334
00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.805
- All right.
- Put that in your hand.

335
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.609
Now hold it like a pencil.

336
00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.290
Now cock your wrist.

337
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.964
- Right.
- Good, good. Elbow out.

338
00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.530
And then you just kinda throw at it.

339
00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:56.641
Like this?

340
00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.211
This is good?

341
00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.851
Well, you kinda throw like a girl.

342
00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:04.810
But when a girl is as beautiful as you
she doesn't have to be good.

343
00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.449
Do you mind if I skip
the Craverston grip?

344
00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.051
Okay, good luck.

345
00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:28.964
Oh, my God! Look at that!

346
00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.165
Maybe I should show you
how to throw like a girl.

347
00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:42.130
Suck on that, Craverston.

348
00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:43.565
Shut up, Oren.

349
00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.287
Where's your girlfriend?

350
00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.371
Tim.

351
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.647
Oh, hey, Karen.
I was just looking for the bathroom.

352
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.330
You were in Jeff's den.

353
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.129
Yeah. I must've made a wrong turn.

354
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:11.281
Um...

355
00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.561
Lovely place you have here,
by the way. You have a great eye.

356
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.721
Thank you.

357
00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.165
Was that your design work
I saw downstairs?

358
00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.891
Jeff had mentioned something
about, uh, urinals.

359
00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:22.441
Yes. Oh, well,
the customer's always right.

360
00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.562
But, yeah, they are my drawings.

361
00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.642
Customer's always right.
Except when they're not.

362
00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.286
- Oh, the bathroom's that way, Tim.
- No, thank you, I'm fine.

363
00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:47.922
<i>That was one of
the best Junetoberfests</i>

364
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:50.208
we have ever, ever had.

365
00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:53.407
Have you ever seen a couple
move into a neighborhood

366
00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.970
so nicely as the Joneses?

367
00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:58.287
You don't you think there's
something off about them?

368
00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.805
I mean, they're so overly

369
00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:04.010
accomplished, and stylish
and affectionate with one another.

370
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.201
Uh...

371
00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.361
Why would they wanna live here?

372
00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:08.528
Karen, they told you,
they wanna settle down.

373
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:10.800
You know that he was
in your den today?

374
00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:12.167
Yeah, so?

375
00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:15.608
So, he can navigate
the bazaars of Marrakesh,

376
00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:18.968
but he gets "lost upstairs"
looking for a bathroom?

377
00:18:19.040 --> 00:18:20.724
Karen, let me tell you something
I learned years ago.

378
00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:24.049
When people have to poop,
they get embarrassed.

379
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:26.362
As do I, sometimes.

380
00:18:26.600 --> 00:18:28.523
Really? You think he had to poop?

381
00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:30.051
Probably, yes.

382
00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:34.002
You know, if the Joneses seem a little
bit more affectionate than we do,

383
00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:37.084
it's because they haven't had to mute
their passions the way we have

384
00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:38.730
'cause the kids have been around.

385
00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:42.247
But now, it's our time.
It's our summer. Watch my hand there.

386
00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:46.041
And I think it's time
to get busy sexually.

387
00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:47.485
♪ <i>Do-do-do-do...</i> ♪

388
00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.925

- Honey, I know we said every second...

390
00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.646
Look at the time. Look how late it is.

391
00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.405
It's traditional Gaffney foreplay.
Let me just do it.

392
00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.606
Come on, baby. Come on.

393
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:58.443
I'm so tired. But I pick up on things.

394
00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:00.363
I was the one who noticed
when the McNultys

395
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.442
were pirating the Yamamotos' cable.

396
00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:07.406
Yes, and intuition
is a wonderful thing.

397
00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.485
And take it from me,
somebody who has had 16 years

398
00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.851
of human resource experience,

399
00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:18.642
that the Joneses are perfectly nice,
normal, everyday people.

400
00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:29.290
I didn't know what to do.

401

Uh... So I figured

402
00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:37.681

Oh! You strong man!

403
00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.001
So you can help me out?

404
00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.209
Absolutely.
You came to the right guys.

405
00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.282
We Americans are good

419
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.365
This is embarrassing.

420
00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:44.841
Well, it happens.
Jeepers, let me help you.

421
00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:46.407
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

422
00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:47.970
What are you doing here?

423
00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:51.362
I found your love
of home brewing contagious.

424
00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:53.283
And I figured I could use a hobby.

425
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.206
Instead of glass blowing?

426
00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.484
Right. Besides that. Besides that.

427
00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.927
It's a cool hobby, but it's probably
not as manly as you'd like.

428
00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:04.688
Hey, Ed.
Set my friend up here.

429
00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.161
He's gonna need some wort chillers,
probably need some fizz drops.

430
00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:08.441
- Give him some yeast.
- You're the expert.

431
00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.204
- Yup.
- Don't let that yeast get infected.

432
00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.281
- Okay.
- I'm kidding.

433
00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:13.010
It's a joke.
It's a yeast infection joke.

434
00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.249
- Expensive hobby.
- It's more of a calling, Tim.

435
00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.246
- Hey, are you hungry?
- I'm famished.

436
00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.607
- You like Chinese?
- The food?

437
00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.840
Yeah.

438
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.251

442
00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.081
<i>Calling Natalie Jones.</i>

00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:54.721
Interesting.

450
00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:25.322
Hi, there! Nice to see you.
Yes, indeed.

451
00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:29.041
That's is my friend, Jeff.
This is Mr. and Mrs. Lu. Okay.

452
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.531
All right, we're gonna go on back.

453
00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:33.811
I know! I feel like I've been
putting on a little too much.

454
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:37.043
Thank you. Come on
back here, Jeff. Thank you.

455
00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.924
I'm doing a little piece on,
sort of, hidden gems around the city.

456
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.411
- Now, that place is good...
- Yeah?

457
00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.727
...but this place is great.
Come on, follow me.

458
00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.921
Ooh...

459
00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:48.809
It's good to get out of the
cul-de-sac every now and again.

460
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:49.881
Well, it is, yeah.

461
00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.166
- I love my cul-de-sac.
- There he is.

462
00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.446
I knew I felt your presence, man!

463
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:54.010
- What's up, brother?
- How are you, pal?

464
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.081
This is my friend, Jeff.

465
00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:56.241
Jeff, this is Ricky.
He owns the place.

466
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.606
- Hi, Ricky, how are you?
- What's up, Jeff?

467
00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.364
You don't have to bow down.
Don't be shy.

468
00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:00.921
Come on in, man. This guy's stiff!

469
00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:05.004
Welcome to the Cobra Club.

470
00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.929
Well, now,
this is Jeff's first time. So...

471
00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.651
Don't worry. We'll take
good care of him, man.

472
00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.801
Where do you want us?

473
00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.247
- Right there, man.
- Thank you. I'll take a <i>shéjiû</i>.

474
00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:18.526
- One?
- Yup.

475
00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.726
- Yeah. Two.
- Two?

476
00:26:19.800 --> 00:26:22.167
- Whatever he's having.
- Two <i>shéjiûs</i> coming up.

477
00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.527
So? A little different
than you were expecting?

478
00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.251
I gotta tell you. Spice and I
don't sit very well together.

479
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:31.881
There's certain ramifications the next
day, you know, toilet-wise, but...

480
00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.280
This is not that.

481
00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.761
Okay? It's not spicy,
but this is the real stuff.

482
00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.001
Oh, I'm ready.

483
00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:39.764
Actually, it reminds me
of when I went kayaking

484
00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.047
down the Pearl River to Zhongshan.

485
00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:44.766
It's just beautiful. A lot of places,

486
00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.171
just like this.

487
00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.288
You have a fascinating job.

488
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.931
- Come on. So do you, Jeff.
- Yes.

489
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.604
I'm sure you could
tell me some stories.

490
00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:55.322
I could tell you some stories
to make your skin crawl.

491
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.205
But I'm in HR.

492
00:26:57.280 --> 00:26:59.123
There's a certain wall
of secrecy around me, so...

493
00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.009
You could tell me,
but you'd have to kill me.

494
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.650
I'd probably just get in trouble
from corporate.

495
00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:07.007
You wouldn't actually kill me.
It's just an expression.

496
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.003
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

497
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.844
- Here we go. All right.
- Okay.

498
00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:13.207
Look at all these
little ethnic condiments.

499
00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.645
- So cool.
- That is...

500
00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.324
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

501
00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.731
Try this. Mmm...

502
00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:19.441
Okay.

503
00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.241
Mmm...

504
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:23.731
Wow! That's good!

505
00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:26.329
What is that? That looks like a snake.

506
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.526
<i>Shéjiû,</i> man.

507
00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:28.886
Snake wine.

508
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.081
That's real cobra.

509
00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.569
The alcohol neutralizes
most of the venom.

510
00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.290
Yeah, in Guangdong,
old dudes say

511
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:37.364
you drink snake wine,
makes your sack hang real low, man.

512
00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.805
Does it?

513
00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.849
Do you have a Arnold Palmer by chance?

514
00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:45.005
You guys want to hear
about tonight's offering?

515
00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.321
Yes. Show us what you got. Thank you.

516
00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:50.809
Where did you find this place? Yelp?

517
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:52.970
It's my job to find places like this.

518
00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.089
I talk to people, I go places.
And when I find a place that I like,

519
00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.685
I like to share it with people I like.

520
00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.331
<i>Shéjiû!</i> Okay, that's a live snake!

521
00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:02.084
Yes, Jeff. It's a snake restaurant.

522
00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:04.851
Yeah, but Panda Express,
they don't serve panda.

523
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.321
Do they?

524
00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.607
They call this "the 100-pace viper,"

525
00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.490
because if it bites you, that's how
far you're gonna get, man.

526
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:13.971
- Is that true?
- No!

527
00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:15.565
It's not true.

528
00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:16.926
It's probably closer to 50 paces,

529
00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.968
- honestly. It's very potent.
- Pretty bad, man.

530
00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:21.884
I'm afraid of snakes.
I'll eat 'em. But, I'm so sorry.

531
00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.849
Ricky knows what he's doing.
He's very good at his job.

532
00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.446
Come on, sit down, okay?
Just let him do his thing.

533
00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:27.646
- Yes.
- You're in good hands.

534
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.324
- Yes.
- Okay? Trust me.

535
00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.249
You're gonna wanna keep
your hands away from the head,

536
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.891
'cause it can actually still bite you.
So, just be very careful.

537
00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.725
Can I have a vegetable spring roll?

538
00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:39.325
Buddy...

539
00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:40.731
You're gonna be just fine. Here.

540
00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.086
- A little more of that.
- Yeah.

541
00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.286
- Yeah.
- Okay? This is good.

542
00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:50.049
- We might need another bottle of this.
- Yeah.

543
00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.009
Let's go ahead and get loosened up.

544
00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.128
- Yeah. Snake it up.
- Yeah.

545
00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.164
One second. That's Karen. Hello?

546
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.481
Remember I told you something
was off about the Joneses?

547
00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.289
Well, my instincts were right.

548
00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.488
<i>I just followed Natalie to the mall
and I have two words for you.</i>

549
00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.285
<i>Sarah Palin.</i>

550
00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.921
<i>And guess what?</i>

551
00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.048
There is a Chinese word
for cul-de-sac. It's...

552
00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.841
I'm sorry, I'm having
a hard time hearing you.

553
00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:21.651
The point is, the Joneses
are not who they say they are.

554
00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.285
Okay. Hold on. I'm sorry.

555
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.808
Karen, I'm-I'm actually,
lunching with, uh, Tim right now.

556
00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.531
There's nothing weird
going on whatsoever. I think...

557
00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.321
I think you're just sublimating
your anxiety about the kids.

558
00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.881
<i>You're having insecurities
about, you know, your career...</i>

559
00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:44.371
Don't even begin to go there!

560
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.126
I don't throw your man crush
in your face.

561
00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:49.363
I don't have a man crush!
I don't have a man crush.

562
00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:52.205
I had it once in my life,
when I was a boy.

563
00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.567
<i>- You mean Bruce?</i>
- She likes to be called Caitlyn.

564
00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.443
No, no, no,
you're absolutely right.

565
00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.769
- Hello, Karen.
- Natalie!

566
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.486
What a surprise!

567
00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.882
You've got no clothes on.
You're on the phone.

568
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:31.724
I'm gonna go.

569
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:34.410
To be continued.

570
00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:39.449
I was just leaving Tim a voice mail.

571
00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:40.601
Oh...

572
00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:43.160
He likes to hear from me
when I'm trying on lingerie.

573
00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.366
I tell him what I'm putting on,
how it looks.

574
00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:50.606
How it makes me feel.

575
00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.805
It looks great!
I'm sure he...

576
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.325
I'm sure he's happy to know that.

577
00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:56.121
Tell him from me.

578
00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:00.603
Yeah, it's one of our things.
Keeps the spark alive.

579
00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.648
Do you and Jeff
have a thing?

580
00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:05.405
Yes, Jeff and I have a thing.

581
00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.051
We...

582
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.930
We do it really fast in case
the kids come running into our room.

583
00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.727
Sounds like you're very sexual people.

584
00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.682
- But your kids are gone, aren't they?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah.

585
00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.923
Time for something new.
Is that why you're buying lingerie?

586
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.490
Yes.

587
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:26.449
Let's see what you decided on.

588
00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:29.364
No.
I mean, I just... It's just stuff.

589
00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.761
Come on. Show me
what you think is sexy.

590
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.451
They're for Jeff's mom.

591
00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.808
She's morbidly obese.
She drives around on a scooter.

592
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.370
I feel really bad for...

593
00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:40.090
Let's be real with one another, okay?

594
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:43.729
And he's dating
Sheila Rondowski,

595
00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.007
I think is her name, on the sly,

596
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:47.844
which is a big no-no,
'cause she's his superior.

597
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:48.967
Sure.

598
00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:50.769
This stuff is so good, Tim.
It's delicious.

599
00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.524
- Didn't I tell you?
- Mmm-m.

600
00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.127
I tell ya... Listen. It is impressive
how people open up to you.

601
00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.248
- They tell you a lot.
- They do.

602
00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.560
It sounds like they complain
a lot, but...

603
00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.928
Oh, gosh! It comes with the territory.
I'm fine with it. But, yes.

604
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.161
Let me ask you this.

605
00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.767
Does anybody ever say
to you in confidence

606
00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.806
how much they hate the company?

607
00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:11.644
Ricky, let's get some more wine!

608
00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.643
Hold a grudge? Anything like that?

609
00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:16.724
Sara Patel, she has
irritable bowel syndro...

610
00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.962
Excuse me. She has
irritable bowel syndrome.

611
00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.526
There's a lot of co-workers,
too, that sit near the bathroom.

612
00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:23.648
Sometimes, we're all irritated
by your bowels, Sara.

613
00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:25.370
Everybody on the fourth floor knows.

614
00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.601
But that's not what I'm talking about.

615
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:28.523
Is there ever a situation
where somebody seems

616
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:30.125
like they came into a lot of money,

617
00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.567
or they, you know,
they bought a new car or new clothes?

618
00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.085
- Looks like they won the lottery?
- Yes.

619
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.400
- Or hit the jackpot?
- Yeah.

620
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.608
- Yeah? Who's that?
- Sanjay. He bought a Grillbot.

621
00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.761
What's that?

622
00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.171
That's the guy I work with.
His name's Sanjay.

623
00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.925
No, I know what Sanjay is.
What's a Grillbot?

624
00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.606
Oh, grillbot is like... It's just a...

625
00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:51.763
It's just a... What it is, is a robot
that cleans your barbecue grill.

626
00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:53.842
You just put it in your grill,
you shut the lid,

627
00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.481
and it just kind of ruminates in there
and gets all the little coal pieces,

628
00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:00.325
the little icky pieces up.
And it's, you know, spick and span!

629
00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.890
It's like a Roomba for your grill.

630
00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:06.322
I'm thinking more of like the...
Like, like... More expensive.

631
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.971
These are $99, Tim. Expensive stuff.

632
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.280
Right.

633
00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:12.522
But you gotta make sure the grill's
off. Sanjay didn't do that.

634
00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:14.489
Are we done talking
about the Grillbot?

635
00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.085
If you're not gonna eat this,
I'm gonna eat this.

636
00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.003
No, no, no, go ahead.
Take what you like.

637
00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.286
The thing is,

638
00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:22.728
is he voided the warranty
on the Grillbot and the grill.

639
00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.121
Jesus, Jeff! Ricky!

640
00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.690
Oh, God! Put it down. Ricky!

641
00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.524
Oh, man! I've never seen that before.

642
00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:30.761
Go find the shot!

643
00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.046
The antivenom. Go get it!

644
00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.246
Hey, little buddy!

645
00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:36.051
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
No, no. Hey.

646
00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.167
He's snacking on my hand.

647
00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:38.730
Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!

648
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.961
All right. Get it out!

649
00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.241
We're all gonna
have to have a relationship.

650
00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:45.969
Hold on. We're gonna get the antivenom
okay, Jeff? Hold on a second.

651
00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.963
You got it? All right.
Hold on, hold on.

652
00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.081
- How does that feel, buddy?
- Huh?

653
00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.400
How does that feel?

654
00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.324
That's good.

655
00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.122
Now this would be incredible on you.

656
00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.645
Perfect, I'll take it.

657
00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:03.203
You're not being fun, Karen.

658
00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:07.808
I want you to forget everything you
heard about functional breast support.

659
00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.731
Why are you so nervous?

660
00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:12.641
Hmm?

661
00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.564
Is it because we're two women
trying on lingerie together?

662
00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.126
Or because I know
you were following me today?

663
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:23.601
I wasn't following. What? No! No!

664
00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:26.286
I was at the mall. I was shopping.
I wonder if they have this in yellow.

665
00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:28.806
- Jeff's favorite color is yellow.
- I'm not stupid, Karen.

666
00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:30.566
You're right to follow me.

667
00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:34.930
To be thinking that this woman
is not who she pretends to be.

668
00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:38.284
Because I'm hiding something.

669
00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.241
You are?

670
00:34:41.640 --> 00:34:42.687
So are you.

671
00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:46.322
We're so alike, you and I.

672
00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:51.247
Two strong, sexually vibrant women.
And yet, here we are.

673
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.086
Forced to bury our true selves
from the Meg Craverstons of the world.

674
00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:56.969
What's Meg got to do with this?

675
00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.280
Oh, come on, Karen.

676
00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.091
I hear the way she talks about me
when she thinks I'm not looking.

677
00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.009
Hating me for the way I look,

678
00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:07.609
as if perfect bone structure and
flawless skin is something I can help!

679
00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:12.289
I may not need to moisturize,
but I still have feelings.

680
00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:15.971
I didn't know about the feelings.

681
00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.531
That's why women like us
need to stick together.

682
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.443
Not follow each other in malls.

683
00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:23.926
Do you Kegel?

684
00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:25.606
- Kegel?
- Mmm-hmm.

685
00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:27.842
You mean the exercises
for the lady parts?

686
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.446
Strength has to start somewhere.

687
00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.522
Not... I don't.

688
00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.608
In fact, I'm doing some right now.

689
00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:42.842
I could crack a walnut down there,
if I needed to.

690
00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:44.926
Have you ever had any need to?

691
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.001
Now you go.

692
00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:50.371
- I couldn't crack anything down there.
- Are we still hiding?

693
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.168
Come on, Karen.
Just... channel your power.

694
00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.731
Okay. I'll do it. I'll try.

695
00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.205
I did it! I felt it!

696
00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.766
How was that?

697
00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:07.481
Work in progress.

698
00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:09.728
Now, you have a choice.

699
00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.005
Which Karen do you wanna be?

700
00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:16.651
Karen, the meek?

701
00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:21.130
Or Karen, the strong?

702
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.483
- Sure you're okay?
- I'm okay. Yeah.

703
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:27.886
You saved my life.

704
00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.725
And that was some good snake.

705
00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:34.044
I'm embarrassed though.

706
00:36:34.800 --> 00:36:36.245
Little drunk.

707
00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:38.402
You had me worried there for a second.

708
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:40.323
Get yourself cleaned up.
I'll get the check.

709
00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.371
I know what you're doing, Tim.

710
00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.044
What am I doing, Jeff?

711
00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.043
I read people for a living.
That's what I do.

712
00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.884
And, you know, you get me drunk
on snake wine

713
00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:54.042
and get me to open up
and tell you secrets.

714
00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:56.921
You...

715
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.603
are trying to make a friend.

716
00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:04.521
I got a lot of friends, Jeff.

717
00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.331
Yeah, but you have a lot
of secrets locked inside of you.

718
00:37:07.920 --> 00:37:10.924
I think that's why you might be one
of the loneliest guys I've ever met.

719
00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:15.811
Now, what do you have
to say about that?

720
00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:19.170
You wanna know something about me?

721
00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.081
Sometimes I hate what I do
for a living.

722
00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.249
But doesn't that feel good?

723
00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.163
To express yourself?

724
00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:41.526
- Is this us bonding now?
- No, this is us talking.

725
00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.409
You want bonding?
I'll show you bonding.

726
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.367
You're gonna look at me.
I'm gonna button you up.

727
00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:49.290
Okay. Okay. That's loud.

728
00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.161
Whoa!

729
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.684
Jesus, you do this for fun?

730
00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.410
I got you, okay?

731
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.644
Isn't this a blast?

732
00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:17.846
Yeah!

733
00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.406
- Hey, Karen! Karen?
- Hey, I'm here!

734
00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.687
Hi, Karen. How are you?
I brought you some flowers.

735
00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.370
Oh, thank you, honey!

736
00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.363
You're not gonna believe
the day that I had.

737
00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.807
Guess who likes being
a man-bird as much as I do?

738
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.041
- Who?
- Tim Jones.

739
00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:54.565
Look at that. Why are you wearing
a robe? Are you sick?

740
00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.449
Oh, nice. Honey,

741
00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:58.688
I'm just thinking.
What am I really doing this summer?

742
00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.765
I mean, I sent the kids away to camp,
I'm redesigning bathrooms.

743
00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.330
Is that what makes me happy?

744
00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.926
Is that what makes me,
Karen Gaffney, complete?

745
00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:10.564
Okay, well, listen,
if you wanna feel complete,

746
00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:12.722
there's some exercises
I do at work with the guys...

747
00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.802
Honey, no. They don't work.

748
00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:17.884
Now, I've lost touch
with the real Karen.

749
00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:21.251
And then these amazing
new neighbors move in

750
00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:23.641
and with me feeling so vulnerable,
it's only natural

751
00:39:23.720 --> 00:39:26.326
that I would get suspicious
and find fault with them.

752
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:31.088
But really, I just feel like
I should be focusing on me.

753
00:39:31.160 --> 00:39:32.446
And on us.

754
00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.090
Sweet baby Jesus,
what's happening?

755
00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:40.811
Natalie said we needed a thing
to keep our spark alive.

756
00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.450
You've been talking to Natalie
about us sexually?

757
00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.966
No, obviously.
I didn't tell her anything, honey.

758
00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:47.486
No, I just mean
she's unusually intuitive.

759
00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:48.686
- For a Greek.
- Right.

760
00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:50.603
And she just thinks
that once you're married

761
00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.842
at a certain point,
you have to make more of an effort.

762
00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.366
This is the Karen that I...
This is the Karen that I love.

763
00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.522
I really do. Take me.

764
00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.364
Take me, darling.

765
00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.441
Okay.

766
00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:03.601
Oh!

767
00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:06.410
Shoot, honey.

768
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.689
It was the conversation piece.

769
00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.647
Don't worry about it.

770
00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.481
Oh...

771
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:17.841
What is that?

772
00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.604
I don't know. It doesn't matter.
Come on.

773
00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:21.011
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

774
00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:24.210
You know what, honey?
We need to go back to our lovemaking.

775
00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:25.566
- Where were we?
- Yeah, okay.

776
00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:28.120
- It's so hot! It's so hot!
- Yeah. Okay, I... Should I grope you?

777
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.281
- Great!
- Yeah.

778
00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:32.727
Let's go back. Oh, Jeff, Jeff!

779
00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:35.690
- It's so hot!
- So, you are sick?

780
00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.967
You know what?
I'll tell you what we should do.

781
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.651
We should put on a soundtrack
for our passion.

782
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.291
You want a little passion music?
This calls for The Judds.

783
00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.486
- We're gonna put on some music.
- Okay.

784
00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.603
I'm going to put the wine glasses
in the dishwasher.

785
00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:49.489
Right. Okay, so you got...
You wanna narrate!

786
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.050
Okay. All right. I got you. So...

787
00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:53.088
And then... This is so much fun!

788
00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.727
The blood leaves Jeff's head

789
00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.121
and slowly makes its way
to his midsection.

790
00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:00.921
I don't know why we're in the closet.

791
00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.161
- It seems very un-erotic to me.
- Honey, listen!

792
00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:04.129
Listen! Because
our neighbors bugged us!

793
00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:06.168
Told you something
was wrong with them.

794
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:08.607
Makes a little more sense
what Tim was doing in your den.

795
00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.806
And do not tell me
that he had to poop.

796
00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.167
He did not have to go number two.

797
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.248
And now I know
what Natalie was doing at the café.

798
00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.566
It was a drop!

799
00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.563
A drop? What are you talking about?

800
00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:20.210
I can't believe she duped me
into this lingerie.

801
00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:22.328
But she was in her underwear
and I was in my underwear and...

802
00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.971
Oh, my God! She was so persuasive.

803
00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:26.769
Wait. You were both in your
underwear at the same time?

804
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:28.644
Get your mind out of the gutter!
It was a charade!

805
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:31.883
Okay, Karen, I just wanna make sure
this isn't another case of paranoia.

806
00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.769
Remember the time you made me sleep in
the car 'cause I ate that hot pepper

807
00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:35.126
and you thought I was possessed?

808
00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:37.441
Your eyes were all red. You were
trying to have sex on a school night.

809
00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:39.887
I know, but it was just the jalapeeno.
That's my point.

810
00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:41.724
God! We gotta call the cops!

811
00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:43.802
Call the cops and tell them what?
Our neighbors bugged the house?

812
00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:45.166
- Yes!
- That sounds crazy!

813
00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:46.924
What happens when
we really need the cops?

814
00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.445
They won't come to our house. Why?

815
00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.761
Because we're on some kind
of crazy list. That's crazy.

816
00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.365
You're right. We need more evidence.

817
00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.443
- And it's a jalapeño.
- Karen. Karen!

818
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.121
Karen!

819
00:42:01.720 --> 00:42:04.041
Kar... Karen, look.

820
00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.804
I know that you miss
Mikey and Patrick,

821
00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.530
but parents weekend
is not for two weeks.

822
00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:08.601
Get down!

823
00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:10.444
Parents weekend
isn't for two weeks.

824
00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.091
Maybe we can do some
breathing exercises to center you.

825
00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:16.721
Jeff, I don't need to do any deep
breathing exercises! I'm centered!

826
00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:18.571
It's quiet over there.

827
00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.406
It's too quiet.

828
00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.844
They're probably watching us,
watching them.

829
00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:27.163
They're not watching us! They're at
a restaurant with Stacey Chung.

830
00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:29.001
How do you know that?

831
00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.560
Because we talked about it
at the indoor skydiving place!

832
00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.165
Why didn't you tell me?

833
00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.890
Karen, stop!

834
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.247
Darling, stop, please!
Think about what you're doing.

835
00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:38.481
You'll go to jail
for something like this.

836
00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.766
Only if I get caught.

837
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.569
See? No fingerprints.

838
00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.881
Now, people move in,
they always change the locks,

839
00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:46.042
but they never change
the garage remote.

840
00:42:46.120 --> 00:42:48.600
I forgot to give it back when Bridget
and Dave went to Myrtle Beach

841
00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.841
and asked me to feed Smokey.

842
00:42:55.560 --> 00:42:58.404
Are you coming?
You're gonna need to cover your hands.

843
00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.289
Cover my hands? With what?

844
00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.486
Use your socks.

845
00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.927
Oh, God! It looks like a show home.

846
00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:10.443
- They painted over Bridget's mural.
- That's a real tragedy.

847
00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.087
Look, there's nothing weird here.
Let's go, let's go!

848
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.845
Karen! There are windows
everywhere. Get down! Get down!

849
00:43:19.840 --> 00:43:21.001
So weird.

850
00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:23.447
Stand up!

851
00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.401
These pots have never seen
a lick of flame.

852
00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.642
Little weird for someone
with a cooking blog, huh?

853
00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.564
Well, it's a new house,
new pots. It makes sense to me.

854
00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:36.644
And an empty spice rack. She wows
the neighbors with her appetizers.

855
00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:37.801
No spices.

856
00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.281
Never judge a woman
by her spice rack, Karen.

857
00:43:40.360 --> 00:43:42.010
Check for stuff about
Sri Lankan orphans.

858
00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.764
I bet that's another web of lies!

859
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:52.246
Sorry, Tim, for breaking
into your house.

860
00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.084
I just wanted to be your friend.

861
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.605
This certainly isn't
a friendly gesture.

862
00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:57.603
You know what, honey? I can hear you.

863
00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.569
And it hurts my feelings
when you're not supportive.

864
00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.324
Karen, this is ridiculous!

865
00:44:02.080 --> 00:44:03.969
It's gotta be here somewhere.

866
00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.762
Karen! Karen, Karen, Karen!

867
00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.569
Look at them. So perfect.

868
00:44:19.840 --> 00:44:20.887
Karen, come on, let's go.

869
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:22.726
Look at this.

870
00:44:22.800 --> 00:44:24.643
Okay. So, they're gamers.
Let's go.

871
00:44:31.520 --> 00:44:33.443
Karen! Don't! What are you doing?

872
00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.041
Stacey Chung.
Isn't she out with the Joneses?

873
00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.121
Yeah.

874
00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:40.087
Ted Wallace.

875
00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.650
He works with you, right?

876
00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:44.769
Yeah. Maybe it's just some
kind of social media thing.

877
00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:46.205
Dhameer Mustafa?

878
00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:47.805
There's Dan.

879
00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:49.281
Sanjay.

880
00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.169
Oh, God! They're targeting MBI.

881
00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.131
There's some kind of missile.

882
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.964
These are all the people
he was asking me about.

883
00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.168
Oh, my God! I told him everything.

884
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.730
- Oh, God.
- We've gotta go.

885
00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:08.801
Switch down the computer, honey.

886
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.450
We gotta get out of here.

887
00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:13.211
I can't get any purchase on the mouse
because I have a sock hand.

888
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.361
- Okay, hold on.
- Switch it off! Put it back.

889
00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:16.005
- Karen...
- Put it back the...

890
00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:18.208
No! You don't understand!
They're spies.

891
00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.726
- Karen, please, okay? Just shh!
- We gotta go right now!

892
00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:21.881
I need to write
these names down.

893
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.291
What are you doing? We gotta go!

894
00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.840
They could be back at any second.

895
00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:26.921
What are you staring at?

896
00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.841
What is that? A pen?

897
00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:29.967
What?

898
00:45:30.920 --> 00:45:32.410
- What?
- You have a...

899
00:45:35.520 --> 00:45:37.488
Oh, God! Oh, my God! Now what?

900
00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:38.891
Oh, shit, I killed her.

901
00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.246
Karen!

902
00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.251
Karen!

903
00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:43.367
Oh, thank God!

904
00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.601
Honey.

905
00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.683
Okay, we gotta go. Karen, wake up!

906
00:45:58.920 --> 00:45:59.967
Oh, God.

907
00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:02.881
Okay. Okay. Damn!

908
00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:09.051
Sorry. Sorry.

909
00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.527
- You're welcome, baby.
- Okay.

910
00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:16.566
- You're so cute!
- Karen, shh!

911
00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:19.563
Okay. Okay.

912
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:23.008
Why are you shushing me?
They haven't any dogs.

913
00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.602
I thought Chili's
was supposed to be fancy.

914
00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.648
Yeah, I don't think you ordered well.

915
00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:37.849
Whee!
Remember when we were in college,

916
00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.367
and your parents, they almost caught
us in the bushes, and we hid!

917
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.044
Yeah.

918
00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.645
Wait, I met you after college.

919
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:48.288
Oh, my God!

920
00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.964
It's almost like our wedding night.

921
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.963
Why did we do that?
What are we doing?

922
00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.087
What do we do?

923
00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.889
Jeff, you're being so serious!

924
00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.004
- I'm Jeff. I'm so serious.
- Karen, Karen, Karen!

925
00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.444
- Why are you being so serious?
- Okay.

926
00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.126
- Stop licking me!
- Yeah.

927
00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.440
Okay, listen. Oh, shit!

928
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.641
Shit.

929
00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:10.210
- I'm getting on top!
- I...

930
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:11.327
I'm getting on top.

931
00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.970
- Karen! Karen! Karen!
- I'm on top!

932
00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:14.929
That makes me feel weird.
Karen, please.

933
00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.843
I'm not into this right now,
sweetheart.

934
00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:18.649
I'm not really into this.

935
00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.681
- Cuddle me.
- No cuddling! Our neighbors are spies!

936
00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:24.161
- Our neighbors are spies.
- I wanna cuddle. Cuddle me.

937
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:26.163
Look at them up there.

938
00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.602
Probably going upstairs to make sex,
and they won't even think about us.

939
00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.168
You broke my heart, Tim Jones.

940
00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.570
You broke my heart.

941
00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:39.442
I'm just saying,
the place is called Chili's.

942
00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.646
- It's a Mexican place.
- I can't believe...

943
00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:42.290
- I don't know why you would...
- ...we're still talking about that.

944
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.725
...order anything remotely Asian.

945
00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:47.327
Okay. I guess we can cross off Stacey.

946
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.970
She's not going to give us anything.

947
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:51.281
Hey, do you know what a Grillbot is?

948
00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:53.321
What?

949
00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:55.289
It's this thing. Jeff was telling me
about it the other day.

950
00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:58.523
It's this little robot
that cleans your barbecue...

951
00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:00.523
I hope this is not going to be
a problem.

952
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.681
What?

953
00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:11.330
First rule of what we do. Don't get
too close to your targets. Remember?

954
00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.561
Actually...

955
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:16.531
the first rule of what we do, is to
not fall in love with your partner.

956
00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:20.570
Right? Wasn't that the first rule?

957
00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.005
Tim Jones.

958
00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:25.722
What am I going to do with you? Hmm?

959
00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.969
I don't know.

960
00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:30.280
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

961
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.328
- I have a few ideas.
- I have some ideas too.

962
00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:33.526
You do?

963
00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:36.524
- Mmm-hmm. Should I start now?
- Yes, you should.

964
00:48:38.640 --> 00:48:41.689
Uh... Okay. Okay.

965
00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:52.802
Well, that might be a problem.

966
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.884
Hey, buddy. Can I use your computer?

967
00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.002
I need to check
my fantasy baseball roster.

968
00:49:05.080 --> 00:49:06.241
Go ahead. Go ahead.

969
00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:07.526
Thanks.

970
00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:20.044
What is happening?

971
00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.646
You okay, Jeff?
You seem kind of distant.

972
00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:24.609
No, I'm fine. I'm just...

973
00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:27.923
sifting through the wreckage
of every value I once held dear.

974
00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:32.085
Good. I was worried
it might be something real.

975
00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:37.566
Hey, Dan.

976
00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:40.410
Dan!

977
00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:51.168
The Joneses aren't
who they say they are.

978
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.081
What are you talking about?

979
00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:56.006
Your phone.

980
00:49:56.560 --> 00:49:58.449
Okay. Okay.

981
00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:03.646
Spies?

982
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:30.846
<i>But it's not like that,
I swear!</i>

983
00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.127
Sometimes she picks up on things.
This time she was right.

984
00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:34.884
You have to take this upstairs, Carl!

985
00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:38.089
This company, my neighborhood,

986
00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:41.801
Western civilization as we know it,
they're all at risk.

987
00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:45.564
And it might be my fault.

988
00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:51.368
All right, Gaffney.
I'll do some digging.

989
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:52.721
Okay. Thank you.

990
00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:54.564
See what I can learn
about these devices.

991
00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:57.769
And if I find out they're real,
and not from some hobby shop,

992
00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:00.571
- well, you wait for my call.
- Okay.

993
00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:29.767
Go for Jeff.

994
00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.320
I gotta say, Gaffney,
you and your wife were right.

995
00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:36.161
<i>You know those devices you gave me?
I was talking to a friend of mine.</i>

996
00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:37.645
Ex-military.

997
00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.803
And well, this line is unsecured,
so I can't go into details,

998
00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.930
but let me just say,
this stuff is the real shit!

999
00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:48.209
God! Okay. Who are the Joneses
working for? Are they Russian?

1000
00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:49.441
Damn it, Gaffney.

1001
00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:52.126
What is it about the word
"unsecured" that you don't get?

1002
00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:53.690
<i>Look, I'm gonna do some more digging,</i>

1003
00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.206
and then you meet with me
before work tomorrow.

1004
00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:57.691
Okay.

1005
00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.723
You know the old MBI building? On 75?

1006
00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.723
<i>7:00 a.m. Just look for the van.</i>

1007
00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.006
Why are we meeting there?

1008
00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.562
Well, so we can strategize
before we take it upstairs!

1009
00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:08.449
<i>My buddy says the last time
he saw tech like that</i>

1010
00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.330
<i>was on a dead man.</i>

1011
00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:11.526
Dead man? Why would you say...

1012
00:52:12.800 --> 00:52:13.926
Jesus!

1013
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.128
<i>"Jesus" is right.</i>

1014
00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.849
<i>Gaffney, this is the big time!
I mean, we are going all the way.</i>

1015
00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.082
- Not now, Carl. Not now.
<i>- Don't try to give me the brush off.</i>

1016
00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:25.850
<i>If you think you're gonna
handle this yourself...</i>

1017
00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:28.082
- Okay, okay.
<i>- ...you're making a big mistake!</i>

1018
00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.691
- Work buddy.
<i>- Gaffney, don't mess this up!</i>

1019
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.762
- Carl! Okay, yeah. Good.
<i>- 7:00 a.m. Bring lattes...</i>

1020
00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.209
You okay there, buddy?
You almost ran me over.

1021
00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.965
Yeah, I was looking for Bernie.
He keeps pooping

1022
00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:43.242
in my yard and I was just...
I mean, his dogs keep

1023
00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:46.369
pooping in my yard. I was distracted.

1024
00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:47.801
How are you?

1025
00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.245
You don't seem like yourself, Jeff.

1026
00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.731
You don't seem like yourself, Tim.

1027
00:52:50.800 --> 00:52:52.086
What's that supposed to mean?

1028
00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.250
I was... You said it to me. I was...
What did you mean when you said it?

1029
00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:57.849
We think we had a break-in last night.

1030
00:52:57.960 --> 00:53:00.361
- What?
- Yeah. I know. Really rocks your

1031
00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:02.124
faith in the notion of trust,
doesn't it?

1032
00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:04.449
Tell me about it. My gosh!

1033
00:53:04.600 --> 00:53:05.647
You'd think in a neighborhood
like this

1034
00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:07.324
you wouldn't have to worry
about something like that.

1035
00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.890
I'm so sorry about that, Tim.

1036
00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.531
Yeah, well, Jeff,
here's the thing about trust.

1037
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.444
Once it's gone, bad things happen.

1038
00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:19.686
I heard that.

1039
00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.081
Okay, well, I should go.

1040
00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.764
Karen and I are supposed to
take a bath.

1041
00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.041
Yeah, a little warning.
Carl can be a bit prickly,

1042
00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.805
but he's a top notch security man
and he happens to like the way

1043
00:53:45.880 --> 00:53:47.882
- your mind thinks, okay?
- Okay.

1044
00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.402
Is that him in the bathrobe
hanging laundry?

1045
00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:55.287
I don't know.
Maybe he's having a yard sale.

1046
00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.249
Gaffney, right on time!

1047
00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:03.085
And you brought the lattes.
Knew I could count on you.

1048
00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:05.811
This is my wife Carl.
I mean, this is my wife, Carl.

1049
00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.041
Nice to meet you.

1050
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:08.167
- Nice to meet you.
- Karen Gaffney.

1051
00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:10.641
Yeah, well, welcome
to my home away from home.

1052
00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.882
Or to be more accurate, my home.

1053
00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:15.884
But not for long.
Here, please. Thank you.

1054
00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:17.121
Sit down here.

1055
00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:18.929
Let me just clear this stuff away.

1056
00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.810
Get this laundry outta here.

1057
00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.961
Uh...

1058
00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:25.806
It's the maid's day off.

1059
00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:28.042
Not at all. It's just that

1060
00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.003
when you told us to meet you
at the van,

1061
00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:31.690
I didn't realize
you'd be living in it.

1062
00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.569
Yeah, well, the truth is...

1063
00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.688
you know, I've been living
in the old Westfalia here

1064
00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:39.202
ever since my wife left me
and took everything I had.

1065
00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.089
- Sorry, Carl.
- That's terrible.

1066
00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.811
And now thanks to you for bringing me
in on this deal, Jeff.

1067
00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.167
I think things are finally
starting to break my way again!

1068
00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:47.480
What do you have for us?

1069
00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.286
Oh, boy, what have I got?
Let me show you here.

1070
00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:53.724
You know, here's something that Jeff
never thought he'd hear. Gaffney...

1071
00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:56.565
are you ready for a level four
security clearance?

1072
00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.240
- Okay.
- Okay. Here we go.

1073
00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:01.606
- Carl.
- Yeah?

1074
00:55:01.680 --> 00:55:03.762
You got like a red dot
on your forehead.

1075
00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:05.610
It's called adult acne.
Thank you very mu...

1076
00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.211
God!

1077
00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.407
I've been hit!

1078
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.768
I've been hit! I've been hit!

1079
00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.731
Oh, my God! Shit.

1080
00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:18.040
- Are you hurt?
- I've been shot!

1081
00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:20.322
God! No, honey, it's just the latte!

1082
00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.129
It burns! It burns!

1083
00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.083
Oh, shit! It's the Joneses!

1084
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.324
Try not to shoot them.

1085
00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.004
Let's run for Carl's house.

1086
00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:32.764
Oh, God!

1087
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.011
Get in the car! Now!

1088
00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.481
Let us get on with
our stupid little lives!

1089
00:55:43.600 --> 00:55:46.683
Get in the car now
and I will explain everything. Mostly.

1090
00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.808
I'm tired of your
silver-tongued lies, Jones!

1091
00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.281
Do you wanna get killed
out here? Get in the car!

1092
00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:53.005
Why? So you could kill us in there?

1093
00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.521
There were no spices
in your spice rack!

1094
00:55:56.320 --> 00:55:58.846
I said get in the car.

1095
00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.811
We're gonna get in the car.

1096
00:56:01.240 --> 00:56:03.766
For Patrick and Mikey. Right, honey?

1097
00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:05.882
Guys, now. It is very dangerous. Now!

1098
00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.361
When I count to three
we're gonna run, okay?

1099
00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.442
One... Two...

1100
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.926
Jeff!

1101
00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.968
- Oh, my God!
- I said three!

1102
00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.203
Jeff, please, would you
just get in the car?

1103
00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:18.281
I was making a head start!

1104
00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:19.566
On your wife?

1105
00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:21.005
You two are acting like children
right now.

1106
00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:23.162
Now, get in the car.
Right now. Get in this car.

1107
00:56:23.240 --> 00:56:25.846
Put your seat belt on,
for Christ's sake.

1108
00:56:26.080 --> 00:56:27.081
- Oh, my God.
- Come on!

1109
00:56:27.240 --> 00:56:28.890
- Go, go, go.
- Let's go, let's go.

1110
00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.730
What is going on here, Tim?

1111
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:33.086
Are you stealing secrets from MBI?

1112
00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.850
We're not stealing secrets from you.

1113
00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.570
- There they are.
- I see them.

1114
00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.130
We're spies.

1115
00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:39.611
His seat belt is jammed!
Pull over.

1116
00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:40.841
Shut up!

1117
00:56:40.920 --> 00:56:42.206
Jeff gets car sick
in the back!

1118
00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:43.850
- Quiet!
- Shut up!

1119
00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:48.881
You broke into our house.

1120
00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.644
What kind of neighbors are you?

1121
00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:53.081
You planted a bug in our house.
What kind of neighbors are you?

1122
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:55.643
You know, they kind of have a point.

1123
00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.526
It's so hot in here.

1124
00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.801
- Put the AC on. Please!
- No.

1125
00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:00.006
Can you turn the
air conditioner on, please?

1126
00:57:00.080 --> 00:57:02.287
- It's not going on!
- It's hot.

1127
00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.043
My seat belt's not on! Wait!

1128
00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:20.884
Okay, it's about to get weird.

1129
00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.689
About to get weird?

1130
00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.931
Quick question. Are you guys
the good guys or bad guys?

1131
00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.561
What do you think?

1132
00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.927
- I think the guys in black...
- Shit!

1133
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.526
...on the motorcycles shooting at us
might be the bad guys.

1134
00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:49.080
Get down, get down, get down!

1135
00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.926
What is that?

1136
00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:03.651
It's camp.

1137
00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:05.006
What?

1138
00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.282
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

1139
00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.168
- The cookies are for both of you.
- Karen!

1140
00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:12.607
Mikey, if you split it,
he gets to choose first.

1141
00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:14.131
- Karen!
- Because that's fair!

1142
00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:18.005
Get down! Get down
Karen, get off the phone!

1143
00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:20.202
Because otherwise you would
make one piece bigger.

1144
00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:22.328
And then you'd pick that one.
Put Mikey on, put...

1145
00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.323
Just split the cookie!
Just split the cookie!

1146
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:27.567
Oh, shit!

1147
00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.371
To the right, Natalie.

1148
00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:53.566
Thanks, Karen.

1149
00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:56.527
Brake!

1150
00:59:00.360 --> 00:59:01.850
Oh, my God!

1151
00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:09.366
Okay. Okay. Okay.

1152
00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:15.325
Please get out of the way.

1153
00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:17.721
Please get out of the way
so I can see.

1154
00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.931
There's something blinking on the back
of the car. Is that bad?

1155
00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.649
Yes, Jeff, that is decidedly bad.

1156
00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.404
You need to go out there
and take that off.

1157
00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.767
- Wha... I need to take it off?
- Yes!

1158
00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:49.410
- Well, can you slow down?
- No!

1159
00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:51.090
- I'm driving. We're being chased.
- Get it off!

1160
00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:52.685
I'm not gonna slow down.
They're trying to kill us!

1161
00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.888
Right. Coming from the guy who
wouldn't turn on the air conditioner.

1162
00:59:56.560 --> 00:59:57.925
Slow down a little bit.

1163
00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:00.082
I'm getting wet! I'm getting wet!

1164
01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.009
Getting wet is better
than getting shot!

1165
01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.161
It's hot!

1166
01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:14.405
Three targets, two shots.
You got this?

1167
01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:15.766
Always.

1168
01:00:16.440 --> 01:00:18.522
How you doing back there, Jeff?
We need you, buddy.

1169
01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.446
Wait.

1170
01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:24.844
- Okay.
- Wait.

1171
01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:27.081
Now.

1172
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:29.768
I got it! I got it! Now what?

1173
01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:31.046
Hold on, Jeff!

1174
01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.001
Throw it! Throw it!

1175
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.721
Oh!

1176
01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.287
Five here? So, what do you think?
I think I'm stuck.

1177
01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.682
Yeah. Well, I think one, two, three,
four, five... It's gotta be six.

1178
01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.966
Here we go, folks.

1179
01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.327
- Scrambled whites with toast.
- Thank you.

1180
01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.528
- Three-egg omelet with potatoes.
- Thank you!

1181
01:01:03.600 --> 01:01:06.251
Eggs, potatoes, and bacon.
And a side of bacon.

1182
01:01:06.320 --> 01:01:08.607
- Yum, yum, yum, yum!
- Thank you very much.

1183
01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.371
Oh, my goodness!

1184
01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:13.242
Mmm. Mmm.

1185
01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.008
What? High speed car chases
make me hungry, honey.

1186
01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:23.325
Okay, Mr. and Mrs. Jones, if that's
who, you know, you really are.

1187
01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.289
I have a couple of questions. And...

1188
01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:28.331
I think this time
we kind of deserve the truth.

1189
01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:29.811
You're entitled to it.

1190
01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:31.928
Okay, question number one.

1191
01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.280
Are you in the CIA?

1192
01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:37.248
Honey, that's a wasted question.
They can't answer that.

1193
01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.968
Question number two then.
Who are you after?

1194
01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:42.046
We can't tell you.

1195
01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.961
Okay. Question number three.
Is it somebody we know?

1196
01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.246
Can't say that, either.

1197
01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.970
You just said we were
entitled to the truth.

1198
01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:49.849
Did say you were entitled to it.
Doesn't mean we can give it to you.

1199
01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.047
You know what, honey?

1200
01:01:51.120 --> 01:01:52.963
It's probably classified.
That's why they can't tell us.

1201
01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:55.845
- Do you want any of this?
- Yeah. I'll have some potatoes.

1202
01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:57.684
I'm glad everybody's just

1203
01:01:57.840 --> 01:02:00.161
enjoying their meal
while we're in the middle

1204
01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:02.368
of a... Like, a thing!

1205
01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.443
You guys are just eating
like there's nothing going on.

1206
01:02:04.520 --> 01:02:06.045
I'm a little troubled by it!

1207
01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:10.962
Honey! That is not okay.

1208
01:02:11.080 --> 01:02:14.243
Fine. I'll keep asking 'til I get
something that's not classified.

1209
01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:15.401
Is that fine with you?

1210
01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.561
Okay.

1211
01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.924
Question 17.

1212
01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.810
After a shootout like that,
who cleans up all the bullets?

1213
01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:28.210
Okay, can you guys
tell us anything at all?

1214
01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.562
I'm not Greek. I'm Israeli.

1215
01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:33.761
Ex-Mossad?

1216
01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.521
Can't tell you.

1217
01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:36.931
Come on. Are you guys even married?

1218
01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:38.651
Can you even tell us that?

1219
01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:41.005
Yes. That actually you can't fake.

1220
01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.806
But that's it?
Everything else was a lie?

1221
01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.848
I mean, 'cause I think when you
told me that you hated your job,

1222
01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:51.401
that seemed real. I mean,
from an HR perspective.

1223
01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:53.164
That seemed real.

1224
01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:59.288
You told him you hate your job?

1225
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:05.640
I may have mentioned
certain misgivings, in confidence.

1226
01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.125
Interesting.

1227
01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.560
Why is this coming out now?

1228
01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:12.048
Because Jeff is actually
a good listener.

1229
01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.964
And I did mention that
to you before, in Marrakesh.

1230
01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.122
At that place that
we always go to. Hazim's.

1231
01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.524
That day, we spent the whole
afternoon there.

1232
01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:22.206
We talked about maybe getting
out of this. We talked about

1233
01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:25.609
I could actually become
a travel writer, for real.

1234
01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:26.886
We could maybe have a child.

1235
01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.564
That was hypothetical.
It wasn't a life plan.

1236
01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.926
I didn't think it...

1237
01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:32.764
Okay, this is what we do.
Automatically, we go to Hebrew

1238
01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:34.524
and then it's gonna be a whole thing.

1239
01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.125
And who puts a bug
in a glass sculpture?

1240
01:03:36.200 --> 01:03:38.771
I happen to like my glass sculptures
and I like to share them with people.

1241
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:40.444
It's a legitimate thing.
It's actually appropriate

1242
01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.568
to give somebody a gift.
What isn't appropriate,

1243
01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:45.849
however, is what you happened
to wear at the yard party.

1244
01:03:45.920 --> 01:03:47.922
Now you want me to dress
like some kind of a sexless

1245
01:03:48.080 --> 01:03:49.411
- elementary school nurse...
- Come on. I'm not talking...

1246
01:03:49.480 --> 01:03:51.050
...just to fit in with
the other mothers, right?

1247
01:03:51.120 --> 01:03:52.281
- No offense, Karen.
- You look great!

1248
01:03:52.360 --> 01:03:54.442
You look amazing.
But you have to fit in.

1249
01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:56.443
I mean, it's called being undercover.

1250
01:03:56.560 --> 01:03:59.609
I mean, you had no problem
wearing a burqa in Kabul.

1251
01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.681
But this is the suburbs!

1252
01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:03.923
It's hard. Don't you get it?
Women here are vicious.

1253
01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:06.003
Can I say? You don't know
the women here.

1254
01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:07.921
There you go.

1255
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.047
We don't know anything.

1256
01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.485
Why did you bug our house?

1257
01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.050
Actually, you know less than nothing.

1258
01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:14.162
But the agency received credible intel

1259
01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:17.210
that someone was using your
work computer to commit treason

1260
01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:18.805
against the United States of America.

1261
01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.081
We were using you
to get to whoever they are.

1262
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:23.241
Why not tell him everything?

1263
01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:24.641
Who cares?

1264
01:04:25.120 --> 01:04:27.566
Ten years, 30 countries,
nobody finds us out,

1265
01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:30.325
and we couldn't even
last a week in suburbia!

1266
01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.845
Can I pay, please?

1267
01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.527
Stupid question.
What do we do now?

1268
01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:50.647
Yeah, what do we do now?

1269
01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.290
Just stick to your routine.

1270
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:54.960
And nobody finds out
about any of this, okay?

1271
01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:56.530
I won't tell anybody.

1272
01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:57.647
Yeah, keep it quiet.

1273
01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:59.449
There's this other thing
I needed to ask.

1274
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.525
I know you guys are undercover and
this whole thing is a setup, but...

1275
01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.647
The other day at the Cobra Club,

1276
01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:07.451
was that about getting me drunk
and having me betray my co-workers

1277
01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:12.845
or was that about two guys, you know,
maybe starting a friendship?

1278
01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.969
It was about getting you drunk
and betraying your co-workers.

1279
01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:18.643
Oh, okay. Yeah.

1280
01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:20.165
But the indoor skydiving...

1281
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.721
that was about being friends.

1282
01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:26.565
Ha! See, I told you we bonded.

1283
01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.246
Okay. Remember,
nobody finds out about this.

1284
01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:31.681
- No. I won't even tell my mom.
- Locking it up. Hey, hey.

1285
01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.526
One other thing. I know I'm not
a licensed therapist, okay?

1286
01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.569
But talk, communicate
with one another, okay?

1287
01:05:40.640 --> 01:05:42.847
Jeff is big on communication.

1288
01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.846
I communicate. That's what I do.

1289
01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.610
- You sure do.
- Talk, talk, talk.

1290
01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.206
No, no, no, no, no.
You're absolutely right, Jeff.

1291
01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.203
Communication is a great thing.

1292
01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.886
- All right, I'll see you.
- Bye!

1293
01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.689
- Thanks!
- I should go.

1294
01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.091
- Okay. Take care.
- See you.

1295
01:05:59.480 --> 01:06:02.131
That's so nice of you
to tell them that, honey. Really.

1296
01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:06.123
I think the Joneses
are going to be just fine.

1297
01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.486
Yeah.

1298
01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:17.042
- After you, my dear.
- Thank you.

1299
01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.886
Timmy!

1300
01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:59.204
Well, it was most likely
just a gas leak. So...

1301
01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:02.122
Well, thank you for your statements.

1302
01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.725
- Thank you very much.
- Good night.

1303
01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:10.170
Okay.

1304
01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:12.686
Whoever killed the Joneses
are gonna come after us next.

1305
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.764
Do you think we did the right thing
by lying to the police?

1306
01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:18.127
We promised the Joneses
that we wouldn't say anything.

1307
01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.804
Do you think that
promises count, honey,

1308
01:07:19.880 --> 01:07:21.530
when the people that we made
them to are dead?

1309
01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.721
Yes!

1310
01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.891
Plus,
I don't wanna be haunted.

1311
01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:30.211
They've taken
the barricades down.

1312
01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.486
Oh, my God!

1313
01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:33.244
All right, listen,
I'm gonna grab the essentials.

1314
01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:34.486
We're gonna need our passports.

1315
01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.641
We're gonna need
our birth certificates.

1316
01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:36.801
And we'll need some duct tape.

1317
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:38.166
Get some peppercorns, too!

1318
01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.009
- Mikey...
- Coffee, teas, Goldfish.

1319
01:07:40.360 --> 01:07:41.725
I'm gonna get these onions here.

1320
01:07:42.600 --> 01:07:44.728
- Don't take the onions, put 'em back.
- No, no, no, no.

1321
01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:46.290
- You don't need onions.
- I need...

1322
01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.488
- Trail mix!
- I can't choose.

1323
01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.164
This is a 2,000-piece puzzle.

1324
01:07:50.760 --> 01:07:53.240
- This is a weapon.
- Yeah! Or we can make chicken parm.

1325
01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.401
- It would be nice to have...
- What! You always buy this.

1326
01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:56.084
You should buy the organic one.
I've been through this with you.

1327
01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.605
I don't wanna talk about that
right now.

1328
01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.489
Jeff, don't take the ginger snaps!

1329
01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:00.971
I know, but we might need...

1330
01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:02.690
- Calm down, Jeff.
- Okay!

1331
01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.681
I'm taking this Red Bull.

1332
01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.921
Where are we going?

1333
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.047
I don't know. Anywhere. Just pack!

1334
01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.565
I've never been on the run before.

1335
01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.086
I mean, should I take a bikini,
in case it's gonna get hot?

1336
01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:16.084
No! A bathing suit? Take socks!
Socks! I need my socks.

1337
01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.162
We gotta get the kids.
We gotta get my mom!

1338
01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:20.248
Don't bring her into this!
We said twice a year.

1339
01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.401
Christmas and Easter!

1340
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:23.687
Oh, God! Okay. Okay.

1341
01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.241
- Okay. You know what?
- Karen.

1342
01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.685
It's probably just a fuse.

1343
01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:34.326
Because a house exploded, it could
just be a problem with the grid.

1344
01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.447
Yeah.

1345
01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.124
Maybe you should check
the fuse box, honey.

1346
01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.884
- Okay, yeah.
- And I'm gonna just...

1347
01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.371
stay here and pack.

1348
01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:45.089
Maybe you should
go with me to the fuse box.

1349
01:08:45.160 --> 01:08:47.288
That way you're not, uh, alone.

1350
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.485
Okay, here we go.

1351
01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.688
Okay, okay, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. There we go.

1352
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.250
There it is. There it is.

1353
01:08:55.280 --> 01:08:56.361
Okay.

1354
01:08:58.480 --> 01:08:59.641
It was just the circuit breaker.

1355
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.609
- It's okay.
- Good Lord!

1356
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:04.411
Don't scream. It's not what you think.

1357
01:09:04.480 --> 01:09:07.290
What, you didn't kidnap our friends
and tie them to chairs?

1358
01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.081
It is what you think. But it's
not for the reasons you think.

1359
01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:15.966
Dan is the one
selling secrets from MBI.

1360
01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:17.401
What?

1361
01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:19.050
- You're right. She's very good.
- Told you.

1362
01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.531
Dan, is that true?

1363
01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:23.369
And how are you two alive?
Your house exploded.

1364
01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.523
Jeff, things aren't
always what they seem.

1365
01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.085
You should know that by now.

1366
01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:47.521
So?

1367
01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.728
How could you not tell me
you were feeling this way?

1368
01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:50.801
Well, look...

1369
01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:53.486
To be honest, you are not exactly
the easiest woman in the world

1370
01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.961
- for a man to admit his fears to.
- What?

1371
01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:59.203
How can you say that to me?
I'm compassionate and sensitive.

1372
01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:00.566
You can say anything to me.

1373
01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.125
Well, calling me a pussy
in Hebrew is not helping things.

1374
01:10:10.600 --> 01:10:11.840
Run.

1375
01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.121
Whoa!

1376
01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.362
You dove headfirst
through a plate glass window?

1377
01:10:23.440 --> 01:10:25.363
It's not as hard as it seems.

1378
01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.363
Who's behind all this?
Who's trying to kill you?

1379
01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:30.922
It's an international arms dealer
who calls himself The Scorpion.

1380
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:33.128
The Agency's been after him for years.

1381
01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.044
And your friends here
were about to sell him these.

1382
01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:41.281
That's what we make at MBI?

1383
01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:44.441
- What are these?
- Microchips.

1384
01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:46.648
In the wrong hands,
the information on those chips

1385
01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:49.650
could be used to undermine the entire
U.S. missile defense system.

1386
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.883
For the last three months, Dan's been
smuggling them out of the building.

1387
01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:54.967
Prison-style.

1388
01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:56.929
Wait. Prison-style? What do you mean?

1389
01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:00.004
I think that means he put 'em in
a balloon and stuck 'em up his butt.

1390
01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:01.366
What?

1391
01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.724
Oh, God!

1392
01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.085
Why did you do this, Dan?

1393
01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:10.484
That's exactly what
we're about to find out, Jeff.

1394
01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.446
Yeah.

1395
01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.051
Tim!

1396
01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.088
Spread your legs, Danny boy.

1397
01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.650
Mrs. Jones has some work to do.

1398
01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:23.245
Natalie...

1399
01:11:23.320 --> 01:11:25.891
Jesus. Jeff.
Jeff, please, do something!

1400
01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.041
Either you talk...

1401
01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.531
Jeff, stop her please!
She's a psychopath!

1402
01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:32.082
Tim, can I just have a word with
you guys for one second, please?

1403
01:11:32.160 --> 01:11:34.049
Please don't hurt me. Please.

1404
01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:35.884
- Okay, okay.
- Get this psycho away from me, Jeff.

1405
01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.121
Relax.

1406
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:39.806
We're excited that
you guys are still alive.

1407
01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.726
But this is our basement. This is not
a Abu Ghraib, you know, scenario here.

1408
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.962
- Our kids play down here.
- I don't like it either.

1409
01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:48.008
But this is
a national security situation.

1410
01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:50.970
Yeah, but you can't torch a man's
scrotum and expect him to speak.

1411
01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.121
You'd be surprised.

1412
01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:56.046
These are human beings.
You gotta connect with them, okay?

1413
01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.282
- Let me talk to 'em for two minutes.
- He's a people person.

1414
01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.281
You have 90 seconds.

1415
01:12:01.720 --> 01:12:02.801
Okey-dokey.

1416
01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.250
Okay, Meg.

1417
01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.529
Dan, I want you to know...

1418
01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.482
like the HR department, this basement
is a place of non-judgment, okay?

1419
01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.123
And even though
you stole from the company

1420
01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.771
and betrayed your country
and cul-de-sac,

1421
01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:33.686
and, you know, placed microchips
in your darkest cavity,

1422
01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:34.886
mistakes happen!

1423
01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.442
Oh, my God! Can we please waterboard
them and get this over with?

1424
01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:40.485
We live in confusing times.

1425
01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:44.087
And I think that the lines between
right and wrong become blurry.

1426
01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:47.004
It's hard to even know what those
words mean, isn't it, Dan?

1427
01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:49.082
What is this? Good cop, good cop?

1428
01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.766
Look, I might not know
what's going on, on the sixth floor,

1429
01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:55.970
but did you know that every time
an employee requests a raise

1430
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:57.485
it comes through the HR department?

1431
01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:59.011
And I've seen your requests.

1432
01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:03.290
And I know that they've been denied,
every time, for the last five years.

1433
01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:07.802
That's a lot of time, Dan. Lot of good
time you gave to the company, huh?

1434
01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:10.645
- Where's your piece of the pie?
- Exactly.

1435
01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.370
You know how hard it is
to raise four children

1436
01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:13.601
on a rocket scientist's salary?

1437
01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:15.523
Oh, God! Shut up, you idiot!

1438
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:17.648
No! You shut up, Lady Macbeth!

1439
01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:18.960
Okay.

1440
01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:20.764
You're the one who pushed me
into this, you know that?

1441
01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:23.730
With all your constant demands
and trendy needs.

1442
01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.723
I did not tell you
to go on Jeff's computer

1443
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.484
and make a deal with an arms dealer!

1444
01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:29.289
Well, you didn't tell me not to.

1445
01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.281
Jeff...

1446
01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.883
I was at the end of my rope.

1447
01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:39.326
The financial pressure was crazy.
Groceries and tutors and...

1448
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.529
I got four kids under 13 in braces.

1449
01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.090
Do you understand? Do you, Jeff?

1450
01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.687
I do. You know I do. I mean...

1451
01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.125
if kids have crooked teeth,

1452
01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.565
we can't have crooked teeth
in this society.

1453
01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.246
This isn't Great Britain, you know?

1454
01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.403
There's all sorts of things
you have to keep up with and...

1455
01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.881
New tires for the minivan,
piano lessons,

1456
01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.803
you know, and, because all that...

1457
01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.084
Carl Pronger is dead!

1458
01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.891
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Hang on! Get a hold of yourself!

1459
01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:11.611
I never wanted anyone
to get hurt, Jeff, I swear.

1460
01:14:11.680 --> 01:14:13.250
We were protecting you.

1461
01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.721
The Scorpion doesn't even
know who you are. Karen!

1462
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.325
Shut up, Meg! Brooklyn Loft is stupid.

1463
01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.447
All right, not helping.

1464
01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:20.601
I'm crying.

1465
01:14:20.680 --> 01:14:21.806
Where did you get an onion?

1466
01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.291
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, you.

1467
01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.727
I got it from upstairs.
From our kitchen.

1468
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.927
Is this your phone?
Is this the Scorpion calling?

1469
01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.411
I'm gonna answer this
and you're gonna talk to him.

1470
01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:37.891
And you're gonna lead us to him.

1471
01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.450
He'll sniff me out in a second.
You know what he's capable of.

1472
01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.761
- Answer the phone now.
- Natalie...

1473
01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.966
No more games.

1474
01:14:43.080 --> 01:14:46.527
Look, I can't. I'm not a spy!
I'm a soccer dad!

1475
01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:48.011
He never misses a game.

1476
01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.889
Oh, my God. All right,
I'm gonna answer it.

1477
01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:51.689
No, we can't.
Our cover was blown, remember?

1478
01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.125
Well, I don't have
a lot of options.

1479
01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:54.486
What do you want me to do?

1480
01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.081
Hello?

1481
01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:02.242
<i>Hello? Mr. Rascal Flatts?</i>

1482
01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:06.409
I needed a cover name.

1483
01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.206
<i>Hello?</i>

1484
01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:09.486
Hi!

1485
01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:12.609
Um... Yes, this is Rascal.

1486
01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.967
<i>Are you and your wife
ready to make the deal?</i>

1487
01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:21.611
Yes, Mrs. Flatts and I
are very excited about it.

1488
01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.923
<i>Tomorrow night.
The Odyssey Hotel. 9:00 p.m.</i>

1489
01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:29.367
<i>Go to the V-Bar.
A table will be reserved for you.</i>

1490
01:15:29.440 --> 01:15:31.886
<i>Bring the requested item and wait.</i>

1491
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:34.804
V-Bar. Okay thank you very much.

1492
01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:37.406
Just out of curiosity,
is there a dress code?

1493
01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:41.722
I'll... I can look that up online.

1494
01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.844
Okay.

1495
01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:46.921
What have I done?

1496
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.288
No, no. You did everything great!
You did everything great.

1497
01:15:50.360 --> 01:15:51.441
- Okay.
- You did!

1498
01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.682
- I did.
- Jeff and Karen, welcome to

1499
01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.489
the sexy and exciting world

1500
01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.166
of international espionage
and covert operations.

1501
01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.082
Buddy, I think it's time
we get you in a proper suit.

1502
01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.162
Nice! Is it an extra medium?

1503
01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:07.924
A killer dress.

1504
01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:09.721
That's all of it?

1505
01:16:09.800 --> 01:16:12.485
This tie has been fitted
with a miniature surveillance mic.

1506
01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.722
It's completely undetectable.

1507
01:16:14.840 --> 01:16:17.127
I don't know if I can walk in these.

1508
01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.009
The heel is equipped
with a tracking device

1509
01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.481
that allows us to monitor
your every move.

1510
01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:24.609
Natalie and I will secure
a position right upstairs on the roof.

1511
01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:26.762
And establish a command center.

1512
01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:29.650
Now, you know at some point,
you're gonna have to put on pants.

1513
01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:31.848
Yeah. I know. I'm just nervous still.

1514
01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:33.160
It's gonna be okay.

1515
01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.651
Simple in and out job.

1516
01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:36.848
Make the exchange, leave the hotel.

1517
01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.367
Got it. In and out.
Just out of curiosity,

1518
01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.171
what happens, you know,
worst-case scenario?

1519
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:45.644
Worst-case scenario?

1520
01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:47.802
We radio for backup,
and we storm the place

1521
01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:50.042
with the full force
of the United States government.

1522
01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:52.011
Okay. Got it.

1523
01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:53.491
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1524
01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:56.530
You look good.
Don't forget those pants.

1525
01:17:22.320 --> 01:17:23.651
Reminds me of our first date.

1526
01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:27.041
And our second.

1527
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.006
What's wrong?

1528
01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.083
We never really did finish
that conversation, did we?

1529
01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:38.686
Well, the house did explode.

1530
01:17:38.760 --> 01:17:40.046
So...

1531
01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:45.131
Look, I just want you to know
I realized something last night

1532
01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.362
when I was about to fry
Dan's testicles.

1533
01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:50.244
I know I'm not the best listener,

1534
01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:51.924
but I can change.

1535
01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.604
What? You don't think I can?

1536
01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.081
No, no, no. I know you can.

1537
01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:02.844
Just don't change too much, okay?

1538
01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:06.246
Okay.

1539
01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.004
♪ <i>My wish for you</i> ♪

1540
01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:20.651
♪ <i>Is that this life becomes...</i> ♪

1541
01:18:20.720 --> 01:18:23.087
Honey, are you ready?
What are you doing?

1542
01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:25.561
I was just listening
to some Rascal Flatts.

1543
01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.483
- Trying to get into character.
- Oh, God!

1544
01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:29.767
Patrick leaves these toys
on the stairs.

1545
01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.889
- Somebody's gonna hurt themselves.
- Karen!

1546
01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.770
What? Do you like it? Is it too much?

1547
01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.002
No! Not at all. It's just enough.

1548
01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:39.081
Thanks, honey.

1549
01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:40.924
Is this the lingerie
you were wearing the other day?

1550
01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:43.082
Yeah, I figured if we're gonna
do this, I should do it right.

1551
01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.128
Yeah.

1552
01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:49.409
- You look so handsome.
- Oh, thank you very much.

1553
01:18:49.480 --> 01:18:50.925
How much time until
we have to be at the hotel?

1554
01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.923
We've got 45 minutes.

1555
01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.405
- Karen. Karen.
- Jeff,

1556
01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.244
your tie's stuck.

1557
01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:10.401
- Karen!
- Ooh! Sorry, honey.

1558
01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:18.681
What?

1559
01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:21.286
I think they're having sex.

1560
01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:25.044
Goddamn it,
we don't have time for this.

1561
01:19:25.120 --> 01:19:27.566
I mean, they're supposed to be
here in 45 minutes.

1562
01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.486
Nope, they are done.

1563
01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:34.961
All right.

1564
01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.802
Oh, wow! Look, honey.
Beautiful design!

1565
01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:07.450
- Hey, Karen.
- Yeah?

1566
01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.525
Thanks so much for the sex.

1567
01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.601
Oh...

1568
01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:17.801
Go.

1569
01:20:18.320 --> 01:20:19.606
Hello!

1570
01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.161
- Hi.
- Hi. We have a reservation for two

1571
01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.607
under the name Rascal Flatts.

1572
01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.806
It's not our real name.

1573
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:29.042
We're having an affair.

1574
01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:30.167
Come with me.

1575
01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:36.330
Hey, Tim. We're in the restaurant
right now. Everything's going okay.

1576
01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.087
Honey, sushi.

1577
01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:41.130
There's sushi as well.
I'm gonna sign off for right now.

1578
01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.126
<i>Ciao.</i>

1579
01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.602
- Oh, that's our table.
- No, this way.

1580
01:20:48.920 --> 01:20:50.001
Really?

1581
01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:55.045
Thank you so much.

1582
01:20:57.800 --> 01:20:59.529
Is this the line to
the little boys' room?

1583
01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:01.489
- I don't need to use it.
- Come.

1584
01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:06.884
I'm confused. I...

1585
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:09.930
It's part of the...
I thought it was just gonna be us.

1586
01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:11.650
You fellas with The Scorpion?

1587
01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:20.010
All right, they're on the move.

1588
01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.365
Moving into position.

1589
01:21:34.600 --> 01:21:35.761
Thank you.

1590
01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.249
There he is. Rascal Flatts.

1591
01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:46.890
You have any trouble
finding the place?

1592
01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:48.166
No. Your henchmen were very...

1593
01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.651
I'm a little
ticklish there.

1594
01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:51.051
Your henchmen were very helpful.

1595
01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:54.408
This must be the wife. Wow! You guys
really dressed up for tonight.

1596
01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.926
Thank you. Yeah.
Well, we don't get out very often.

1597
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.128
When we do, we really
like to make the most of it.

1598
01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:01.441
Awesome. Ivan?

1599
01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:03.050
All clear.

1600
01:22:03.120 --> 01:22:06.124
Sorry about the frisking. You cannot
be too careful in my line of work.

1601
01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.611
Let me make it up to you

1602
01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:10.729
with some very expensive,
very delicious champagne.

1603
01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.810
Wow! Look at that gun.

1604
01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:14.961
And by the way,

1605
01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:18.328
you two have gotta try this dip.
It's amazing.

1606
01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.880
It's a cheat day for me, so I went
a little crazy with room service.

1607
01:22:20.960 --> 01:22:22.246
I hope you don't mind.

1608
01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:24.800
Mrs. Flatts makes a great
seven-layer dip. I'll tell you that.

1609
01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.166
I bet she does.

1610
01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.370
I do. The secret is an extra layer.
An eight-layer dip.

1611
01:22:30.440 --> 01:22:32.522
Sneaky! I love that.

1612
01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.889
Do I know you from somewhere?

1613
01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:40.685
<i>I seriously doubt it.</i>

1614
01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:42.880
<i>He's a people person.</i>

1615
01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:46.169
Come on, Jeff. Stay calm.
Just do what we talked about.

1616
01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:50.208
Well, did the people person
bring this person his computer chips?

1617
01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:53.406
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.
You'll find them right here.

1618
01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:54.891
Careful.

1619
01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.400
Denver, 2010.

1620
01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.329
Were you at the National
Aerospace Convention?

1621
01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:17.801
Because I think we were
in the same focus group.

1622
01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:19.881
Are we still doing this?

1623
01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:22.247
No, we're n... it's done.
It's really done. It's so done.

1624
01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:23.924
Why does he keep
asking those questions?

1625
01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.810
I don't think he can help it.
It's just what he does.

1626
01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:29.406
He connects with people.

1627
01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.562
<i>- Perfect, as promised.</i>
- Shit.

1628
01:23:31.640 --> 01:23:32.971
<i>Ivan?</i>

1629
01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:39.445
Wow. Okay. Here we go. Thank you.

1630
01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.568
- Okay! We got it. Great.
- Yeah. That checks out.

1631
01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.961
Well, pleasure doing business
with both of you.

1632
01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.128
Thank you, Mr. Scorpion and friends.

1633
01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:48.885
Thank you. Yeah.
Okay. Grab that stuff.

1634
01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.843
Hey! You drop your little ball.

1635
01:23:52.920 --> 01:23:54.570
That's fine. We have...
I have plenty of those.

1636
01:23:54.640 --> 01:23:56.529
Keep it. Keep it. It's a...

1637
01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:58.284
- Excuse me.
- Stop!

1638
01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.371
You're the HR guy.

1639
01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:09.920
No, he's not. He's an engineer.
He... Dr. Flatts.

1640
01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.809
- Yeah, I'm in the rocket sciences.
- He went to college!

1641
01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.645
- He's very smart. MIT.
- No.

1642
01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:16.529
No. You were right.

1643
01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:18.250
We have met before.

1644
01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:23.884
See from '02 to '05,
I was a mid-level drone at MBI.

1645
01:24:23.960 --> 01:24:27.203
- And you are Jeff Gaffney.
- No.

1646
01:24:27.280 --> 01:24:28.850
- Human Resources.
- Wrong.

1647
01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.083
Yeah. You helped me
with my "suicidal depression."

1648
01:24:32.160 --> 01:24:34.686
With your little trust exercises
and stress balls!

1649
01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:37.530
This entire thing is a setup!

1650
01:24:37.600 --> 01:24:39.125
Goddamn it, Jeff!

1651
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.367
Decoys have been made.
I repeat, decoys have been made.

1652
01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:43.805
We need to extract. Do you copy?

1653
01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.611
Carlos, take a team out,
lock the hallway down.

1654
01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.081
Yuri, take four guys up
the stairwell to the roof.

1655
01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.686
Radio the helicopter, we are getting
the hell out of here.

1656
01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.650
We need backup to extract
the decoys. Do you copy?

1657
01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:56.848
<i>Negative. Collateral damage.</i>

1658
01:24:56.920 --> 01:24:59.844
<i>We cannot engage in a public arena.
Pull back and abort.</i>

1659
01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.251
<i>Do you copy?</i>

1660
01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:03.721
<i>Jones, do you copy?</i>

1661
01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.887
Boris, get some ice tongs
and a cigarette lighter.

1662
01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.765
<i>Goddamn it, Jones. Do you copy?</i>

1663
01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.247
Copy, copy. Pulling out.
I repeat, pulling out.

1664
01:25:15.320 --> 01:25:17.163
We'll meet you
at the extraction point.

1665
01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.881
You really wanna
just leave them in there?

1666
01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.291
Of course not.

1667
01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:27.329
They're our neighbors.

1668
01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:29.963
Sweetie, everything's fine, okay?

1669
01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.247
That's why I rent the extra henchmen,
for situations like this.

1670
01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:34.049
- Is it Peter? No.
- That's why I paid

1671
01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:35.724
- for the whole floor.
- Honey, what are you doing?

1672
01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.723
- I'm trying to figure out his name.
- Chopper to the jet.

1673
01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:38.961
We'll be in Jakarta by morning,

1674
01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:40.371
- and when we get there, I...
- Bruce.

1675
01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:43.640
You talking to me?

1676
01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:46.521
I remember your name.
Your name is Bruce.

1677
01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:48.481
Bruce Springstine.

1678
01:25:48.560 --> 01:25:51.723
I... No, I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

1679
01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:54.201
Nah, I'm the one that mediated
your parking space dispute.

1680
01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:57.284
Is that what caused you
to go into a life of crime?

1681
01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:59.966
A bruised ego
over a lousy parking space?

1682
01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:02.520
Jesus Christ! What is this?
Amateur night?

1683
01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:03.761
Wait a second.

1684
01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:06.571
Your name is Bruce Springstine?

1685
01:26:06.680 --> 01:26:09.251
Yes, Ivan, it is.
It's Bruce Springstine

1686
01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:11.322
and it's a perfectly good name
like any other name.

1687
01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:14.165
And you wanted us
to call you The Boss?

1688
01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.766
I didn't want you guys
to call me "The Boss."

1689
01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.569
I wanted you to call me, "Boss."

1690
01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:22.087
All right? And that's just
for simplicity's sake. Okay?

1691
01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.366
That's just sad.

1692
01:26:23.440 --> 01:26:26.284
And that parking space thing
was bullshit, all right?

1693
01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:29.284
I'd been there for three years!
They still had me in Lot D!

1694
01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:32.045
That's the other side
of the highway, okay?

1695
01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.360
I had to cross the...

1696
01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:34.805
- The footbridge thing. Yeah!
- The little... The footbridge!

1697
01:26:34.880 --> 01:26:36.325
A footbridge, every day,

1698
01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.481
rain or shine!

1699
01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:38.925
So, thank you.

1700
01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:40.604
- I am really going to enjoy this.
- Okay.

1701
01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:42.091
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- No!

1702
01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:44.121
Good. SEAL team's here.

1703
01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.929
Go, go, go! Get down,
get down, get down!

1704
01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:50.244
Go, boys! Go, go, go!
Shock and awe! Shock and awe!

1705
01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:56.807
Honey, I can't hear anything.

1706
01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.803
They're silent killers.
That's how they got Bin Laden.

1707
01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.962
- Let's just stay down, okay?
- Okay.

1708
01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:02.721
Ahem!

1709
01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:13.560
Where's the backup?
Those guys are with him.

1710
01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.210
There's no backup, Jeff.

1711
01:27:15.280 --> 01:27:17.009
They pulled out
when you blew your cover.

1712
01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:20.004
What do you mean there's no backup?

1713
01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:22.651
You're what they call
"collateral damage."

1714
01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:24.324
That's not good. I saw it on <i>Homeland!</i>

1715
01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.006
What do you me... You didn't say
anything about collateral damage!

1716
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:29.003
I asked you about the worst-case
scenario and you said,

1717
01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:31.082
"Well, the worst-case scenario,
I'll have backup."

1718
01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:34.801
Well, this is worse! This is worse
than the worst-case scenario.

1719
01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:36.211
You lied to our faces.

1720
01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:40.683
I did not lie to you. Now, I may
have left out a few key details...

1721
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:42.046
That's a lie, Timothy!

1722
01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:44.168
That is lying by omission.
That's textbook...

1723
01:27:44.240 --> 01:27:47.687
You know what? My whole job is lying.
Okay? That's why I fucking hate it!

1724
01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.168
- I'm sorry, Jeff.
- You're apologizing to him?

1725
01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:54.447
You can't possibly care
about this loser.

1726
01:27:54.520 --> 01:27:57.410
You know what? I actually
do care about this loser.

1727
01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.927
I mean, you and I live
in a world where everybody lies.

1728
01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.890
And everybody hides everything
and obfuscates.

1729
01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.201
But, not... Not Jeff Gaffney.

1730
01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:10.569
Jeff doesn't live in that world.
He's an honest person.

1731
01:28:10.680 --> 01:28:13.684
He's forthright, he's friendly.
He's a good neighbor.

1732
01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:18.401
Do you have any idea how much
courage that takes? Real courage?

1733
01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:21.204
For my money, he's the bravest guy
in this room.

1734
01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:24.727
- Oh, please. Spare me the morality!
- Hey!

1735
01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:26.882
Just hear me out, all right?

1736
01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.368
Look, the Gaffneys,
they don't belong in our world.

1737
01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.329
We don't. We really don't.

1738
01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:33.801
Okay? They're too good for that.

1739
01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.008
Why don't we let them go
back to their world?

1740
01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:38.129
And then you and I, we,

1741
01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.725
can settle this here?

1742
01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.450
Here in our world.

1743
01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:44.444
You guys can go murder each other
and stuff. Just leave us out of this.

1744
01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.648
You know what? I'm just gonna take
care of everything myself. Bruno,

1745
01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.007
lay the plastic sheeting out. I don't
wanna lose the security deposit.

1746
01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:51.811
- Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
- Can I finish a thought today?

1747
01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:54.486
I'm so sorry, Mr. Scorpion.

1748
01:28:54.560 --> 01:28:56.688
But, Natalie,

1749
01:28:56.760 --> 01:28:58.922
ever since we tried on
underwear together...

1750
01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:00.764
- I'm sorry. You talking to her?
- Mmm-hmm.

1751
01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:01.966
Finish your thought.

1752
01:29:02.640 --> 01:29:04.483
I realized something.

1753
01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:07.371
I've been living a lie, also.

1754
01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.046
Karen!

1755
01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.967
What is happening to my life?

1756
01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:30.363
Oh, my God! How long
have you been living that lie?

1757
01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.441
Honey! What? No!

1758
01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.761
I didn't mean it. I just had to
get the knife to her somehow!

1759
01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:38.164
Okay! I get it now. God! Thank God!
Okay, it's gonna be okay.

1760
01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:52.886
It's raining men!

1761
01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:58.926
You guys okay?

1762
01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:01.810
Grab the chips and follow us.
Come on, let's go.

1763
01:30:10.400 --> 01:30:11.765
- Chopper's ready.
- Yeah, get 'em.

1764
01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:12.966
And get the chips!

1765
01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:16.810
Get back, get back, get back!

1766
01:30:22.000 --> 01:30:24.241
- I'm almost out.
- Me too.

1767
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.320
What are we gonna do?

1768
01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:31.451
- We'll have to jump for it.
- Jump? Jump from where?

1769
01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.806
Down there.

1770
01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.291
There's a pool down below.

1771
01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:36.810
It's our only chance.

1772
01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:38.325
Did you think
any of this through?

1773
01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:39.731
Okay.

1774
01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:43.361
Whoa! Whoa!
Where are you going?

1775
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:49.960
Jeff? Jeff!

1776
01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:52.564
Jeff. Jeff are you okay?

1777
01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.971
- I just farted.
- Buddy!

1778
01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.485
You can't jump through
the window like that.

1779
01:30:55.560 --> 01:30:57.767
That's triple pane glass!
You gotta break it first.

1780
01:30:57.840 --> 01:30:59.524
Appreciate the effort though.

1781
01:30:59.640 --> 01:31:01.130
Scoot back, everybody, all right?
Just scoot back.

1782
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.646
Get out of the way.

1783
01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:09.767
Really?

1784
01:31:09.840 --> 01:31:11.001
Stand back!

1785
01:31:11.080 --> 01:31:12.366
What?

1786
01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:18.401
Where'd you get that?

1787
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:20.005
I picked it up off a dead guy.

1788
01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:21.167
- I thought he didn't need it.
- Run! Out of the window!

1789
01:31:21.240 --> 01:31:22.401
All right. Come on.
We're doing this. Let's go!

1790
01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:24.369
- Now! Now!
- Jump! Jump! Jump!

1791
01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:28.286
Whoa!

1792
01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:33.690
It's okay, everybody. It's okay.

1793
01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:34.926
Where's Jeff?

1794
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:36.001
Guys, where's Jeff?

1795
01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:41.401
Jeff! Jeff, you've gotta...

1796
01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:43.164
- Jeff, you've gotta jump!
- Jeff!

1797
01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:44.480
Give me a second.

1798
01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:46.850
- Jeff, jump! Please!
- Just run and jump!

1799
01:31:48.480 --> 01:31:49.481
Oh...

1800
01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:51.642
This is perfect.

1801
01:31:52.400 --> 01:31:55.006
You've been a pain
in my ass all day, Jeff.

1802
01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:58.084
Okay, li... Bru... Mr. Scorpion,

1803
01:31:58.200 --> 01:32:00.248
we all make choices in life and I...

1804
01:32:00.320 --> 01:32:02.482
I'm not being judgmental,
I promise you,

1805
01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:05.723
but do you really think that violence
is the solution? There's this exer...

1806
01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.330
He's all yours, gravity.

1807
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:22.490
And that's why you don't sting the...

1808
01:32:32.240 --> 01:32:33.685
Always have plan B.

1809
01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.923
I know it seemed a lot higher.

1810
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:58.240
Thank you very much.
That's for you. Keep it all.

1811
01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.890
Maybe you could videotape
that and put it online.

1812
01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.689
Where did you get the gun from?

1813
01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.683
No. I don't think we're
gonna keep any of that online.

1814
01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:04.921
That would get a lot of hits.

1815
01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:06.331
And I lined it up, and smashed.

1816
01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.925
Because there's shooting...

1817
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.331
Probably wanna keep it
a little on the down low.

1818
01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:11.767
Yes. Of course.
Yeah, no, no, of course. Yes. Yes.

1819
01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.921
I'm just saying.

1820
01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:14.604
I'm so proud of you guys.

1821
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.569
- You guys wanna come inside?
- Yeah, come in.

1822
01:33:16.640 --> 01:33:17.721
Where are you guys staying?

1823
01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:20.609
- You could stay with us!
- Stay with us!

1824
01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:22.921
Why wouldn't you stay with us?
We have a pull-out couch.

1825
01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:25.970
You can borrow some of my boxer briefs
if you need anything to lounge in.

1826
01:33:26.040 --> 01:33:27.804
- I've got a Wii.
- We've got a flat screen TV!

1827
01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.450
We have free Wi-Fi.

1828
01:33:29.520 --> 01:33:32.205
- You guys are great! Really.
- It's very nice of you to offer.

1829
01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:33.361
But...

1830
01:33:33.440 --> 01:33:34.680
Our ride is coming.

1831
01:33:34.760 --> 01:33:37.764
Yeah. Yeah.
You got your things you have to do.

1832
01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:39.211
Your missions.

1833
01:33:47.280 --> 01:33:48.486
Is that an Uber?

1834
01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:49.886
Sort of.

1835
01:33:52.040 --> 01:33:53.166
Hug?

1836
01:33:53.240 --> 01:33:55.322
- Just a hug?
- Just a hug.

1837
01:33:56.840 --> 01:33:58.763
Thank you. You're an amazing woman.

1838
01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:00.966
Thank you.

1839
01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:04.923
You made an incredible life
for yourself here, Jeff.

1840
01:34:05.840 --> 01:34:08.320
Just remember to leave the cul-de-sac,
every now and again.

1841
01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:11.321
You'd be surprised
at what you find out there.

1842
01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.687
We'll remember.

1843
01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.324
- Time to go.
- Yes.

1844
01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.449
Where's the driver?

1845
01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:25.885
Right here.

1846
01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:28.449
There's no driver in the car.

1847
01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.249
If they're shooting at us,
I get to drive.

1848
01:34:30.320 --> 01:34:31.924
Now you wanna drive.

1849
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.126
I see how it works.

1850
01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:35.885
You get to drive the good car.

1851
01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:38.691
Bye, you guys!

1852
01:34:47.200 --> 01:34:48.247
Okay.

1853
01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:54.442
You know, it's Parents Day
at the camp tomorrow.

1854
01:35:24.560 --> 01:35:27.484
This is going straight
to Facebook. Keep sucking!

1855
01:35:28.800 --> 01:35:30.529
- That's good.
- What does it taste like?

1856
01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.769
It tastes like Mikey's sock.

1857
01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.729
But I mean that in a good way.
Here, try it.

1858
01:35:34.800 --> 01:35:37.201
Oh, I miss Mikey's little feet
and his socks.

1859
01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.611
Yeah. Here.

1860
01:35:39.960 --> 01:35:41.086
Okay, ready?

1861
01:35:42.240 --> 01:35:44.527
Oh, God! That really hurt.

1862
01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:47.486
What?

1863
01:35:48.880 --> 01:35:50.291
Oh, my God!

1864
01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:52.442
- Guys!
- Natalie! Tim!

1865
01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:54.204
You've gotta be kidding me!

1866
01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:55.841
What?

1867
01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.968
- Can I take this?
- Are you kidding me?

1868
01:35:58.040 --> 01:35:59.610
We are here because of you.

1869
01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:00.806
You told us about this place

1870
01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.245
and that's why we came!

1871
01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:04.124
You are here. In Marrakesh.

1872
01:36:04.200 --> 01:36:05.770
- That's a good memory. Wow.
- Amazing!

1873
01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:06.966
- What?
- That's amazing.

1874
01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:08.690
- My God.
- You have a baby!

1875
01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.967
- Yes, he just fell asleep.
- He just fell asleep.

1876
01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.202
You had a baby? You old dogs!

1877
01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:15.647
Does that mean
you guys left the agency?

1878
01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:17.449
- Well, yeah. It's a very...
- Well...

1879
01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:18.760
- Yeah?
- Long story.

1880
01:36:18.840 --> 01:36:21.081
But we can't really
get into it right now.

1881
01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:24.243
But, it's good to see you!

1882
01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:26.527
Jeff, do me a big favor?
Will you just...

1883
01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:28.250
- scoot a little bit to your right?
- Yeah. Sure thing.

1884
01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:29.560
Thank you!

1885
01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:31.324
I am blown away, you guys.
This is un...

1886
01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.846
Jeff, I don't want you
to turn around right now,

1887
01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.367
but there are four guys in fezzes
behind you on the...

1888
01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.726
Jeff, I just said don't turn around.

1889
01:36:38.800 --> 01:36:40.370
Jeff, I just specifically
asked you not to turn around.

1890
01:36:40.480 --> 01:36:42.164
I know but you said there are four
guys in fezzes behind me.

1891
01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:43.480
We're in Morocco.
There's a lot of fezzes.

1892
01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.005
But it's human nature,
I think, to turn around

1893
01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.684
to something like that.
Don't you think?

1894
01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.205
Honey. We blew their cover again.

1895
01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.322
- No! No.
- What?

1896
01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.970
- We should feed the baby?
- I think we should feed the baby.

1897
01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.725
- If you can just pass me the bottle...
- We blew their cover?

1898
01:36:53.800 --> 01:36:55.131
- ...that would be great.
- Darn it.

1899
01:36:55.200 --> 01:36:57.168
- Can you hold this bag for me?
- Do you mind holding the baby?

1900
01:36:57.240 --> 01:37:00.005
Before you freak out,
it's just a baby.

1901
01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.003
- All right? Don't worry.
- Kids are great! I have pictures.

1902
01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.081
- Karen, how do you get...
- I'll tell you what.

1903
01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.730
Just put it in here and show me.

1904
01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.211
Kind of see what I'm dealing with.

1905
01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:07.805
Okay. I see now.

1906
01:37:08.000 --> 01:37:09.490
Okay? See what that is?

1907
01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:11.403
- It's okay, honey.
- I need you to breathe.

1908
01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.050
- You can do it.
- You've done this before.

1909
01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:16.681
On three, I want you to get down,
and take cover. Okay?

1910
01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:17.841
One...

1911
01:37:17.920 --> 01:37:18.921
Two...

1912
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.048
Jesus, Jeff!
Everybody down, right now.

1913
01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:28.760
- I miss those guys.
- Me too.
