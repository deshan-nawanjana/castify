3
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:29.411
Wake up the Americans.

4
00:01:30.698 --> 00:01:31.765
Hey!

5
00:03:16.404 --> 00:03:18.139
We live in a twilight world.

6
00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:22.120
We live in a twilight world.

7
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:24.155
And there are
no friends at dusk.

8
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:26.981
You've been made. This siege is
a blind for them to vanish you.

9
00:03:32.053 --> 00:03:33.764
But I established contact.

10
00:03:33.854 --> 00:03:35.532
Bring you in or kill you.

11
00:03:35.622 --> 00:03:37.892
I have two minutes. Make up your mind.

12
00:03:42.696 --> 00:03:44.042
Where's the package?

13
00:03:44.132 --> 00:03:45.266
Coat check.

14
00:04:09.723 --> 00:04:10.791
Stay.

15
00:04:21.936 --> 00:04:24.139
Grab his!

16
00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:38.695
No friends
at dusk, huh?

17
00:04:38.785 --> 00:04:39.730
You'll do.

18
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.322
Get him to the rally point.

19
00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:16.201
Swap clothes. The Ukrainians
are expecting a passenger.

20
00:05:16.291 --> 00:05:18.036
I've never seen encapsulation
like this.

21
00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:20.438
We don't know how old it is,
but it's the real deal.

22
00:05:20.528 --> 00:05:21.473
Did you have an out?

23
00:05:21.563 --> 00:05:23.341
Service tunnel to the sewer.

24
00:05:23.431 --> 00:05:26.743
Take this. Take him. Take his exit.
I don't trust ours anymore.

25
00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:28.179
Can you defuse that?

26
00:05:28.269 --> 00:05:29.581
It's centrally synchronized.
Are there more?

27
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:31.149
Covering their tracks.

28
00:05:31.239 --> 00:05:32.716
- Taking out the audience?
- They're just the cheap seats.

29
00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:33.585
That's not our mission.

30
00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:34.943
Mine now.

31
00:06:00.335 --> 00:06:01.336
Walk away.

32
00:06:05.106 --> 00:06:07.308
You don't have to
kill these people.

33
00:06:19.988 --> 00:06:21.032
That wasn't one of us.

34
00:06:21.122 --> 00:06:22.823
I'll take the help.

35
00:06:24.726 --> 00:06:25.927
Go, go, go.

36
00:06:38.673 --> 00:06:40.751
It's not the guy!

37
00:06:56.457 --> 00:06:57.802
A man can be trained

38
00:06:57.892 --> 00:06:59.837
to hold out
for about 18 hours,

39
00:06:59.927 --> 00:07:03.064
so your colleagues
will be clear by 7:00.

40
00:07:09.103 --> 00:07:10.915
He didn't last 18 minutes.

41
00:07:11.005 --> 00:07:12.884
He didn't have anything
to hide.

42
00:07:12.974 --> 00:07:15.410
You were smuggling a nobody.

43
00:07:18.446 --> 00:07:20.181
It's risky.

44
00:07:23.251 --> 00:07:25.697
Or were you counting on this?

45
00:07:25.787 --> 00:07:27.198
Death.

46
00:07:27.288 --> 00:07:29.223
CIA issue.

47
00:07:36.264 --> 00:07:39.534
Spare yourself,
once they clear.

48
00:07:53.847 --> 00:07:55.893
Almost 7:00.

49
00:07:55.983 --> 00:07:57.352
Uh-oh.

50
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.192
It's running fast.

51
00:08:07.929 --> 00:08:10.398
We have to put it back
one hour.

52
00:08:29.851 --> 00:08:31.386
Get it out!

53
00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.889
Welcome to the afterlife.

54
00:08:57.979 --> 00:09:00.258
You've been in a
medically-induced coma

55
00:09:00.348 --> 00:09:04.028
while we got you out of Ukraine
and rebuilt your mouth.

56
00:09:04.118 --> 00:09:08.356
The suicide pills
are fake.

57
00:09:09.257 --> 00:09:10.535
Why?

58
00:09:10.625 --> 00:09:12.236
A test.

59
00:09:12.326 --> 00:09:13.461
A test?

60
00:09:16.731 --> 00:09:18.633
They pulled my teeth out.

61
00:09:20.067 --> 00:09:22.437
Did my team get clear?

62
00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:24.682
No.

63
00:09:24.772 --> 00:09:26.707
Private Russians, we think.

64
00:09:27.708 --> 00:09:29.644
Somebody talked.

65
00:09:30.678 --> 00:09:32.190
Not you.

66
00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.416
You chose to die instead of
giving up your colleagues.

67
00:09:44.258 --> 00:09:48.172
We all believe we'd run
into the burning building.

68
00:09:48.262 --> 00:09:52.543
But until we feel that heat,
we can never know.

69
00:09:52.633 --> 00:09:54.001
You do.

70
00:09:59.874 --> 00:10:01.519
I resign.

71
00:10:01.609 --> 00:10:05.223
You don't work for us.
You're dead.

72
00:10:05.313 --> 00:10:08.192
Your duty transcends
national interests.

73
00:10:08.282 --> 00:10:10.284
This is about survival.

74
00:10:12.587 --> 00:10:13.688
Whose?

75
00:10:16.157 --> 00:10:17.625
Everyone's.

76
00:10:20.127 --> 00:10:23.307
There's a cold war,
cold as ice.

77
00:10:23.397 --> 00:10:27.044
To even know its true nature
is to lose.

78
00:10:27.134 --> 00:10:28.746
This is knowledge divided.

79
00:10:28.836 --> 00:10:32.383
All I have for you is a gesture

80
00:10:32.473 --> 00:10:34.853
in combination with a word.

81
00:10:34.943 --> 00:10:36.244
"Tenet."

82
00:10:37.913 --> 00:10:40.658
Use it carefully.

83
00:10:40.748 --> 00:10:44.028
It'll open the right doors,
but some of the wrong ones, too.

84
00:10:44.118 --> 00:10:46.254
That's all they've told you?

85
00:10:47.255 --> 00:10:49.023
That test you passed?

86
00:10:50.658 --> 00:10:51.759
Not everybody does.

87
00:13:04.725 --> 00:13:09.473
With a high-vis vest and a clipboard,
you can get almost anywhere.

88
00:13:09.563 --> 00:13:11.265
Almost.

89
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.367
An obscure tenet.

90
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.454
No small talk.

91
00:13:23.544 --> 00:13:25.656
Nothing that might reveal
who we are or what we do.

92
00:13:25.746 --> 00:13:28.492
I thought I was here
to find out what we do.

93
00:13:28.582 --> 00:13:31.228
You're not here for "what,"
you're here for "how."

94
00:13:31.318 --> 00:13:34.465
"What" is your department
and not my business.

95
00:13:34.555 --> 00:13:36.767
Well, to do what I do...

96
00:13:36.857 --> 00:13:39.760
I need some idea
of the threat we face.

97
00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:45.776
As I understand it,
we're trying to prevent World War III.

98
00:13:45.866 --> 00:13:47.601
Nuclear holocaust?

99
00:13:48.036 --> 00:13:49.270
No.

100
00:13:50.705 --> 00:13:52.339
Something worse.

101
00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:02.817
Aim it and pull the trigger.

102
00:14:04.886 --> 00:14:05.931
It's empty.

103
00:14:06.021 --> 00:14:07.022
Aim it.

104
00:14:12.928 --> 00:14:14.261
Check the magazine.

105
00:14:18.566 --> 00:14:19.734
How?

106
00:14:25.073 --> 00:14:29.387
One of these bullets is like us,
traveling forwards through time.

107
00:14:29.477 --> 00:14:32.189
The other one's
going backwards.

108
00:14:32.279 --> 00:14:34.648
Can you tell which is which?

109
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:38.362
How about now?

110
00:14:38.452 --> 00:14:41.165
It's inverted.
Its entropy runs backwards.

111
00:14:41.255 --> 00:14:44.102
So, to our eyes,
its movement is reversed.

112
00:14:44.192 --> 00:14:47.571
We think it's a type of inverse
radiation triggered by nuclear fission.

113
00:14:47.661 --> 00:14:48.639
You didn't make it?

114
00:14:48.729 --> 00:14:50.142
No, we don't know how yet.

115
00:14:50.232 --> 00:14:51.542
So, where'd it come from?

116
00:14:51.632 --> 00:14:53.979
Someone's manufacturing them
in the future.

117
00:14:54.069 --> 00:14:56.048
They're streaming back at us.

118
00:14:56.138 --> 00:14:57.471
Try it.

119
00:15:04.478 --> 00:15:06.480
You have to have dropped it.

120
00:15:18.325 --> 00:15:20.337
How can it move
before I touch it?

121
00:15:20.427 --> 00:15:22.773
From your point of view,
you caught it.

122
00:15:22.863 --> 00:15:25.242
But from the bullet's point of
view, you dropped it.

123
00:15:25.332 --> 00:15:26.978
But cause comes before effect.

124
00:15:27.068 --> 00:15:30.247
No, that's just the way
we see time.

125
00:15:30.337 --> 00:15:32.184
Well, what about free will?

126
00:15:32.274 --> 00:15:34.618
That bullet wouldn't have moved
if you hadn't put your hand there.

127
00:15:34.708 --> 00:15:37.812
Either way we run the tape,
you made it happen.

128
00:15:39.047 --> 00:15:40.815
Don't try to understand it.

129
00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:43.417
Feel it.

130
00:15:53.828 --> 00:15:54.930
Instinct.

131
00:15:56.730 --> 00:15:57.832
Got it.

132
00:16:02.503 --> 00:16:04.705
Why does it feel so strange?

133
00:16:05.639 --> 00:16:08.019
You're not shooting the bullet,

134
00:16:08.109 --> 00:16:09.610
you're catching it.

135
00:16:11.146 --> 00:16:12.780
Whoa.

136
00:16:15.116 --> 00:16:17.261
I've seen this type
of ammunition before.

137
00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:18.329
In the field?

138
00:16:18.419 --> 00:16:19.597
I was almost hit.

139
00:16:19.687 --> 00:16:22.000
Then you were
exceedingly lucky.

140
00:16:22.090 --> 00:16:25.137
An inverted bullet passing through
your body would be devastating.

141
00:16:25.227 --> 00:16:26.594
Not pretty.

142
00:16:28.163 --> 00:16:29.740
These look like today's.

143
00:16:29.830 --> 00:16:31.575
They may have been made today
and inverted years from now.

144
00:16:31.665 --> 00:16:33.611
Where did you get them?

145
00:16:33.701 --> 00:16:36.680
Came with the wall. I was assigned it,
like all the material I'm studying here.

146
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:38.449
Do you have an analysis
on the metals?

147
00:16:38.539 --> 00:16:40.384
Sure. Why?

148
00:16:40.474 --> 00:16:42.988
The mixture of alloys can tell me
where they might have been made.

149
00:16:43.078 --> 00:16:44.578
Look...

150
00:16:45.713 --> 00:16:47.581
I'm not seeing Armageddon here.

151
00:16:49.951 --> 00:16:52.596
The bullet may not seem like
much, but it's a simple machine.

152
00:16:52.686 --> 00:16:55.756
Lead bullet, brass casing,
gunpowder.

153
00:16:56.490 --> 00:16:58.069
If they can invert that,

154
00:16:58.159 --> 00:16:59.838
I see no reason they couldn't
invert pretty much anything.

155
00:16:59.928 --> 00:17:03.008
Even a nuclear weapon
can only affect our future.

156
00:17:03.098 --> 00:17:06.935
An inverted weapon might be
able to affect our past as well.

157
00:17:10.372 --> 00:17:15.053
Now that we know what to look for, we're
finding more and more inverted material.

158
00:17:15.143 --> 00:17:17.979
Remnants of complex objects.

159
00:17:21.316 --> 00:17:22.816
What do you think we're seeing?

160
00:17:24.685 --> 00:17:27.188
The detritus of a coming war.

161
00:17:46.141 --> 00:17:48.186
- <i>Yep?</i>
- We live in a twilight world.

162
00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:50.588
<i>No friends at dusk.
I was told you left the building.</i>

163
00:17:50.678 --> 00:17:52.224
Even the dead need allies.

164
00:17:52.314 --> 00:17:53.892
<i>Specifically?</i>

165
00:17:53.982 --> 00:17:57.128
I need an assist in Mumbai.
I need to get to Sanjay Singh.

166
00:17:57.218 --> 00:17:58.729
<i>Singh?</i>

167
00:17:58.819 --> 00:18:00.497
<i>He never leaves his house.
And his house is...</i>

168
00:18:00.587 --> 00:18:01.632
- <i>his house.</i>
- Yes, it is.

169
00:18:01.722 --> 00:18:03.301
I'm looking right at it.

170
00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:05.136
<i>I'll see who's on deck.</i>

171
00:18:05.226 --> 00:18:07.228
<i>Bombay Yacht Club in two hours.</i>

172
00:18:19.506 --> 00:18:20.784
It seems you need
an introduction

173
00:18:20.874 --> 00:18:24.145
to a prominent Mumbai local
on short notice.

174
00:18:25.347 --> 00:18:26.557
I'm Neil.

175
00:18:26.647 --> 00:18:28.682
I need an audience
with Sanjay Singh.

176
00:18:30.818 --> 00:18:32.097
That's not possible.

177
00:18:32.187 --> 00:18:35.100
Ten minutes tops.

178
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.601
Time isn't the problem.

179
00:18:37.691 --> 00:18:39.995
It's getting out alive
that's the problem.

180
00:18:42.696 --> 00:18:46.211
Would you take a child hostage?
A woman?

181
00:18:46.301 --> 00:18:47.578
If I had to.

182
00:18:47.668 --> 00:18:49.580
I'm not looking to make much
noise here.

183
00:18:49.670 --> 00:18:50.648
Yes?

184
00:18:50.738 --> 00:18:53.774
Vodka tonic. And a Diet Coke.

185
00:18:56.077 --> 00:18:57.145
What?

186
00:18:58.013 --> 00:18:59.257
You never drink on the job.

187
00:18:59.347 --> 00:19:00.825
You're well-informed.

188
00:19:00.915 --> 00:19:04.595
Well, pays to be
in our profession.

189
00:19:04.685 --> 00:19:07.022
Well, I prefer soda water.

190
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:10.691
No, you don't.

191
00:19:11.592 --> 00:19:13.537
How's your parachuting?

192
00:19:13.627 --> 00:19:15.373
I broke an ankle
during basic training.

193
00:19:15.463 --> 00:19:18.709
Singh's house isn't tall enough
to parachute off of.

194
00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.111
It's bungee-jumpable.

195
00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:22.446
I don't think "bungee-jumpable"
is a word.

196
00:19:22.536 --> 00:19:25.773
It may not be a word, but it may
be our only way out of that place.

197
00:19:26.874 --> 00:19:28.943
Or into it, for that matter.

198
00:20:08.249 --> 00:20:10.919
I know you're tired.
I'm also very tired.

199
00:21:13.581 --> 00:21:15.427
Stay back.

200
00:21:15.517 --> 00:21:18.595
I was almost taken out by a very
unusual type of ammunition in Ukraine.

201
00:21:18.685 --> 00:21:21.632
I want to know who supplied it.

202
00:21:21.722 --> 00:21:23.468
My name is Sanjay.

203
00:21:23.558 --> 00:21:25.636
And you are?

204
00:21:25.726 --> 00:21:27.595
No chitchat?

205
00:21:27.694 --> 00:21:29.207
There's no one
at the other end.

206
00:21:29.297 --> 00:21:30.899
No one who's gonna
help you, anyway.

207
00:21:32.866 --> 00:21:34.701
Don't let it get cold.

208
00:21:36.571 --> 00:21:38.349
Why should I know
who supplied it?

209
00:21:38.439 --> 00:21:41.618
Combination of metals
is unique to India.

210
00:21:41.708 --> 00:21:42.753
If it's from India,
it's from you.

211
00:21:42.843 --> 00:21:44.621
- Fine assumption.
- Deduction.

212
00:21:44.711 --> 00:21:46.291
Deduction, then.

213
00:21:46.381 --> 00:21:47.892
Look, my friend...

214
00:21:47.982 --> 00:21:50.929
guns are never conducive
to a productive negotiation.

215
00:21:51.019 --> 00:21:53.621
I'm not the man they send
to negotiate.

216
00:21:54.956 --> 00:21:56.801
Or the man they send
to make deals.

217
00:21:56.891 --> 00:22:00.028
But I am the man
people talk to.

218
00:22:01.695 --> 00:22:03.208
I can't.

219
00:22:03.298 --> 00:22:04.409
I can't tell you.

220
00:22:04.499 --> 00:22:06.010
You're an arms dealer, friend.

221
00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:08.712
This may be the easiest trigger
I've ever had to pull.

222
00:22:08.802 --> 00:22:10.614
To say anything
about a client

223
00:22:10.704 --> 00:22:13.684
would violate the tenets
he lives by.

224
00:22:13.774 --> 00:22:16.945
If tenets are important to you,
then you can tell me.

225
00:22:17.645 --> 00:22:18.957
Everything.

226
00:22:19.047 --> 00:22:22.127
Not while you have a gun
to my husband's head.

227
00:22:22.217 --> 00:22:25.762
Sanjay, make a drink
for our guest, please.

228
00:22:25.852 --> 00:22:27.432
<i>Cheers.</i>

229
00:22:27.522 --> 00:22:29.567
- Priya.
- Hmm.

230
00:22:29.657 --> 00:22:31.536
This is your operation?

231
00:22:31.626 --> 00:22:34.939
A masculine front in
a man's world has its uses.

232
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:37.375
The dealer you're looking for
is Andrei Sator.

233
00:22:37.465 --> 00:22:38.610
The Russian oligarch.

234
00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:40.644
- You know him?
- Not personally.

235
00:22:40.734 --> 00:22:42.646
Made his billions in gas.

236
00:22:42.736 --> 00:22:46.417
Moved to London. Said to be on
the outs with Moscow.

237
00:22:46.507 --> 00:22:48.253
Very good.

238
00:22:48.343 --> 00:22:51.289
Except the gas he made his billions
from was actually plutonium.

239
00:22:51.379 --> 00:22:55.193
None of which explains how or why
you sold him inverted munitions.

240
00:22:55.283 --> 00:22:57.795
When I sold him the rounds,
they were perfectly ordinary.

241
00:22:57.885 --> 00:23:00.231
So how did he
get them inverted?

242
00:23:00.321 --> 00:23:03.134
We believe he's functioning
as some sort of a broker.

243
00:23:03.224 --> 00:23:05.426
Between our time
and the future.

244
00:23:06.827 --> 00:23:08.573
He can communicate
with the future?

245
00:23:08.663 --> 00:23:10.108
We all do, don't we?

246
00:23:10.198 --> 00:23:12.010
E-mails, credit cards, texts.

247
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:16.047
Anything that goes into the record
speaks directly to the future.

248
00:23:16.137 --> 00:23:20.084
The question is,
can the future speak back?

249
00:23:20.174 --> 00:23:22.453
And I'm supposed to find out?

250
00:23:22.543 --> 00:23:26.723
To get anywhere near Sator would
take a fresh-faced protagonist.

251
00:23:26.813 --> 00:23:29.460
And you are fresh as a daisy.

252
00:23:29.550 --> 00:23:30.694
Get close.

253
00:23:30.784 --> 00:23:33.031
Find out what he's receiving
and how.

254
00:23:33.121 --> 00:23:35.066
Is it safe to involve
British Intelligence?

255
00:23:35.156 --> 00:23:37.791
I have a contact
who's out of Sator's reach.

256
00:23:43.998 --> 00:23:46.067
You must've had a plan for
getting out.

257
00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:48.835
Not one I love.

258
00:24:11.793 --> 00:24:13.638
May I help you, sir?

259
00:24:13.728 --> 00:24:15.139
I'm Mr. Crosby's lunch.

260
00:24:15.229 --> 00:24:17.909
I presume you mean
Sir Michael Crosby's lunch.

261
00:24:17.999 --> 00:24:19.110
Presume away.

262
00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:20.968
If you'll follow me.

263
00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:27.909
Started without you.
Hope you don't mind.

264
00:24:28.543 --> 00:24:29.911
I'll catch up.

265
00:24:30.712 --> 00:24:31.823
Same for me, please.

266
00:24:31.913 --> 00:24:32.991
I'll send the waiter.

267
00:24:33.081 --> 00:24:35.460
No, just pass on the order.

268
00:24:35.550 --> 00:24:38.363
I gather you have an interest
in a certain Russian national.

269
00:24:38.453 --> 00:24:41.366
Anglo-Russian.
So I have to watch my step.

270
00:24:41.456 --> 00:24:44.202
Indeed. He's tapped into
the intelligence services.

271
00:24:44.292 --> 00:24:47.538
I've warned them
he's feeding them rubbish...

272
00:24:47.628 --> 00:24:48.873
but they don't seem to care.

273
00:24:48.963 --> 00:24:50.575
Tell me about him.

274
00:24:50.665 --> 00:24:54.112
I assume you're familiar with
the Soviet-era secret cities.

275
00:24:54.202 --> 00:24:58.082
Closed cities, not shown on maps.
Built around sensitive industries.

276
00:24:58.172 --> 00:25:01.686
Most of them have been opened
up and renamed as regular towns.

277
00:25:01.776 --> 00:25:03.554
Not the one Sator grew up in.

278
00:25:03.644 --> 00:25:05.156
Stalsk-12.

279
00:25:05.246 --> 00:25:08.026
In the '70s,
it had a population of about 200,000.

280
00:25:08.116 --> 00:25:09.427
Thought to be abandoned.

281
00:25:09.517 --> 00:25:11.195
Abandoned?

282
00:25:11.285 --> 00:25:14.666
Some kind of accident. After which
it was used for underground tests.

283
00:25:14.756 --> 00:25:17.468
Two weeks ago, same day as the
Kiev opera siege,

284
00:25:17.558 --> 00:25:20.838
we spotted a detonation
in northern Siberia,

285
00:25:20.928 --> 00:25:23.241
just where Stalsk-12 was.

286
00:25:23.331 --> 00:25:26.744
Sator emerged from
this blank spot on the map

287
00:25:26.834 --> 00:25:28.646
with ambition...

288
00:25:28.736 --> 00:25:31.883
and enough money to buy his way
into the British establishment.

289
00:25:31.973 --> 00:25:33.418
Through his wife?

290
00:25:33.508 --> 00:25:36.054
Katherine Barton. Oldest niece
of Sir Frederick Barton.

291
00:25:36.144 --> 00:25:38.523
She works at Shipley's.
Met Sator at an auction.

292
00:25:38.613 --> 00:25:39.557
A happy marriage?

293
00:25:39.647 --> 00:25:41.726
Practically estranged.

294
00:25:41.816 --> 00:25:42.894
Well, how do I get to Sator?

295
00:25:42.984 --> 00:25:44.529
Well, through her, of course.

296
00:25:44.619 --> 00:25:47.188
You may have an inflated idea
of my powers of seduction.

297
00:25:47.722 --> 00:25:48.923
Hardly.

298
00:25:49.791 --> 00:25:51.993
We have an ace in the hole.

299
00:25:54.495 --> 00:25:57.075
You're carrying a Goya
in a Harrods bag.

300
00:25:57.165 --> 00:25:59.777
It's a fake by a Spaniard
named Arepo.

301
00:25:59.867 --> 00:26:03.114
One of two we've confiscated
from an embezzler in Bern.

302
00:26:03.204 --> 00:26:04.817
What happened to the other one?

303
00:26:04.907 --> 00:26:07.685
It turned up at Shipley's.
Authenticated by Katherine Barton.

304
00:26:07.775 --> 00:26:09.087
Put on auction.

305
00:26:09.177 --> 00:26:10.823
And who do you think bought it?

306
00:26:10.913 --> 00:26:11.889
Her husband?

307
00:26:11.979 --> 00:26:13.214
Mmm-hmm.

308
00:26:14.415 --> 00:26:16.227
Does she know it's a forgery?

309
00:26:16.317 --> 00:26:17.528
Oh, it's hard to say.

310
00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:21.766
Rumor has it that
she and Arepo were close.

311
00:26:21.856 --> 00:26:23.157
Uh-huh.

312
00:26:24.058 --> 00:26:25.970
Look, no offense,

313
00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.997
but in this world, when someone
is claiming to be a billionaire...

314
00:26:31.265 --> 00:26:33.411
Brooks Brothers won't cut it.

315
00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:35.179
I'm assuming I'm on a budget.

316
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:38.005
Save the world,
then we'll balance the books.

317
00:26:38.706 --> 00:26:40.418
Can I recommend a tailor?

318
00:26:40.508 --> 00:26:41.786
I'll manage.

319
00:26:41.876 --> 00:26:43.988
You British don't have a
monopoly on snobbery, you know.

320
00:26:44.078 --> 00:26:45.323
Well, not a monopoly.

321
00:26:45.413 --> 00:26:47.582
More of a controlling interest.

322
00:26:48.917 --> 00:26:50.595
Could you box that up for me?

323
00:26:50.685 --> 00:26:51.786
Certainly not.

324
00:26:52.987 --> 00:26:55.056
Goodbye, Sir Michael.

325
00:27:27.655 --> 00:27:29.123
How can I help, sir?

326
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:35.440
Sorry, I wasn't notified
of any appointments, Mr...

327
00:27:35.530 --> 00:27:36.531
Goya.

328
00:27:37.732 --> 00:27:39.177
Mr. Goya.

329
00:27:39.267 --> 00:27:41.502
No. I'm told you're
the person to see about Goya.

330
00:27:44.071 --> 00:27:45.506
That's extraordinary.

331
00:27:50.678 --> 00:27:52.179
What's it worth?

332
00:27:53.214 --> 00:27:55.116
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves.

333
00:27:56.384 --> 00:27:59.320
Lots of work to do
before any kind of valuation.

334
00:28:00.555 --> 00:28:04.335
Provenance, microscopic
examination, X-rays.

335
00:28:04.425 --> 00:28:06.694
But what does
your heart tell you?

336
00:28:10.698 --> 00:28:12.633
Sir, where did you say
you acquired this drawing?

337
00:28:13.768 --> 00:28:14.835
Tomas Arepo.

338
00:28:18.205 --> 00:28:21.686
I bought my Goya for cents on a
dollar from an irate Swiss banker.

339
00:28:21.776 --> 00:28:24.655
Traced it back to Arepo,
then realized I scored a bargain

340
00:28:24.745 --> 00:28:27.558
when he told me who paid top dollar
for another one of his pictures.

341
00:28:27.648 --> 00:28:30.027
- Your husband.
- Where's your bargain?

342
00:28:30.117 --> 00:28:31.229
Your drawing's an obvious fake.

343
00:28:31.319 --> 00:28:33.030
My drawing's a very good fake.

344
00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.499
You know that
better than anyone.

345
00:28:34.589 --> 00:28:36.524
The information's the bargain.

346
00:28:37.993 --> 00:28:40.004
The information that I helped
defraud my own husband?

347
00:28:40.094 --> 00:28:43.341
He and I are in related businesses,
but he's a very hard man to meet.

348
00:28:43.431 --> 00:28:44.910
If you and I were
to make an arrangement...

349
00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.277
Arrangement?

350
00:28:46.367 --> 00:28:47.880
You mean blackmail.

351
00:28:47.970 --> 00:28:49.247
Don't be afraid of the word.

352
00:28:49.337 --> 00:28:51.382
My husband isn't.

353
00:28:51.472 --> 00:28:53.251
I'm sorry to tell you
he got there first.

354
00:28:53.341 --> 00:28:55.286
He knows? And he's never done
anything about it?

355
00:28:55.376 --> 00:28:56.487
Why would he?

356
00:28:56.577 --> 00:28:58.155
He paid $9 million for it.

357
00:28:58.245 --> 00:29:00.725
Barely cover the cost of the
holiday he just forced us on.

358
00:29:00.815 --> 00:29:02.383
Where'd you go, Mars?

359
00:29:03.451 --> 00:29:07.164
Vietnam, on our yacht.
His yacht.

360
00:29:07.254 --> 00:29:10.601
You've got the suit.
The shoes, the watch.

361
00:29:10.691 --> 00:29:13.404
Think you're a little
out of your depth.

362
00:29:13.494 --> 00:29:16.674
People who've amassed fortunes,
like your husband's,

363
00:29:16.764 --> 00:29:20.635
generally aren't okay with
being cheated out of any of it.

364
00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:28.509
The drawing is his hold
over me.

365
00:29:32.446 --> 00:29:37.652
He threatened me with police.
Prison. The works.

366
00:29:39.787 --> 00:29:41.532
He controls me.

367
00:29:41.622 --> 00:29:44.268
My contact with my son.
Everything.

368
00:29:44.358 --> 00:29:47.929
Leaving would never have been
easy but now it's impossible.

369
00:29:49.196 --> 00:29:51.365
You can't fight.

370
00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.902
Just beg.

371
00:29:55.904 --> 00:29:58.016
In Vietnam,
I tried to love him again.

372
00:29:58.106 --> 00:30:01.485
Thought if there was love there,
he might give me my son back.

373
00:30:01.575 --> 00:30:05.723
We sat on that bloody boat
watching the sunsets,

374
00:30:05.813 --> 00:30:08.225
<i>imitating some earlier time
in our lives.</i>

375
00:30:08.315 --> 00:30:11.262
He seemed happy,
so I asked him.

376
00:30:11.352 --> 00:30:13.364
<i>And he made me an offer.</i>

377
00:30:13.454 --> 00:30:16.323
He'd let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

378
00:30:19.827 --> 00:30:23.140
I expressed myself.
I took Max ashore.

379
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:25.944
He called us, contrite.

380
00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:27.578
And when we got back,

381
00:30:27.668 --> 00:30:28.981
<i>I glimpsed some other woman
diving off the boat,</i>

382
00:30:29.071 --> 00:30:30.604
and he'd vanished.

383
00:30:33.507 --> 00:30:35.386
I never felt such envy.

384
00:30:35.476 --> 00:30:36.955
You don't seem
the jealous type.

385
00:30:37.045 --> 00:30:38.646
Of her freedom.

386
00:30:41.950 --> 00:30:44.997
You know how I dream
of just diving off that boat?

387
00:30:45.087 --> 00:30:46.520
But you share a son.

388
00:30:47.189 --> 00:30:49.600
That's my life now.

389
00:30:49.690 --> 00:30:51.702
Did you know the drawing
was a fake?

390
00:30:51.792 --> 00:30:52.770
No.

391
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.306
Tomas and I became close,
maybe too close.

392
00:30:55.396 --> 00:30:56.707
I failed.

393
00:30:56.797 --> 00:30:59.243
Andrei can't conceive of
failure, only betrayal.

394
00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:00.912
But I didn't betray my husband.

395
00:31:01.002 --> 00:31:03.581
Retrospect, maybe I missed
my chance.

396
00:31:03.671 --> 00:31:05.449
And he let Arepo walk free.

397
00:31:05.539 --> 00:31:07.551
If you'd actually met Arepo
as you claimed,

398
00:31:07.641 --> 00:31:10.287
you'd understand
he no longer walks anywhere.

399
00:31:10.377 --> 00:31:11.522
We spoke on the phone.

400
00:31:11.612 --> 00:31:13.758
He can't do that either.

401
00:31:13.848 --> 00:31:15.927
- Where's the drawing?
- Why?

402
00:31:16.017 --> 00:31:17.461
Get me an introduction.

403
00:31:17.551 --> 00:31:19.163
I'll take the drawing
out of the equation.

404
00:31:19.253 --> 00:31:22.600
No picture, no prosecution,
no more hold over you.

405
00:31:22.690 --> 00:31:24.903
I might just be
your second chance.

406
00:31:24.993 --> 00:31:26.838
No, I don't need redemption.

407
00:31:26.928 --> 00:31:28.395
At betrayal.

408
00:31:34.268 --> 00:31:35.469
Friends of your husband's?

409
00:31:36.470 --> 00:31:37.849
You knew this was
going to happen?

410
00:31:37.939 --> 00:31:40.152
Don't worry,
they won't kill you.

411
00:31:40.242 --> 00:31:43.487
Andrei dislikes tangling with local
law enforcement on that level.

412
00:31:43.577 --> 00:31:45.924
You must've really not liked
the look of me.

413
00:31:46.014 --> 00:31:47.926
The look of you's fine.

414
00:31:48.016 --> 00:31:51.228
It's best to get to the nasty part
before I care one way or the other.

415
00:31:51.318 --> 00:31:52.864
There's a number
in your left coat pocket.

416
00:31:52.954 --> 00:31:54.388
Don't call from home.

417
00:31:55.756 --> 00:31:57.658
You won't be taking my call.

418
00:31:59.426 --> 00:32:02.130
I might surprise you.

419
00:32:32.027 --> 00:32:34.662
I ordered my hot sauce
an hour ago.

420
00:32:37.364 --> 00:32:38.766
Can we get going?

421
00:32:52.379 --> 00:32:54.126
Please?

422
00:32:54.216 --> 00:32:55.616
He wants you to see.

423
00:33:21.542 --> 00:33:23.912
And he gets what he wants.

424
00:33:30.352 --> 00:33:32.553
Not always, apparently.

425
00:33:38.592 --> 00:33:40.205
<i>Anna says we're going
to Pompeii</i>

426
00:33:40.295 --> 00:33:41.438
and see lava.

427
00:33:41.528 --> 00:33:43.607
We will.
We'll go together.

428
00:33:43.697 --> 00:33:45.599
I'll be there, too!

429
00:34:05.287 --> 00:34:06.854
Told you I'd surprise you.

430
00:34:08.422 --> 00:34:09.500
He's a cute kid.

431
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.791
He's everything.

432
00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:14.705
Where's the drawing?

433
00:34:14.795 --> 00:34:16.908
Oslo. At the airport.

434
00:34:16.998 --> 00:34:18.375
The airport?

435
00:34:18.465 --> 00:34:20.711
Do you know what a Freeport is?

436
00:34:20.801 --> 00:34:23.315
<i>A storage facility
for art that was acquired...</i>

437
00:34:23.405 --> 00:34:25.482
<i>But not yet taxed.</i>

438
00:34:25.572 --> 00:34:27.685
<i>We started a network.</i>

439
00:34:27.775 --> 00:34:31.355
<i>Rotas, this construction company,
built them. I brought in the clients.</i>

440
00:34:31.445 --> 00:34:33.524
<i>The facilities are tax havens.</i>

441
00:34:33.614 --> 00:34:36.061
<i>The clients can view their
investments without importing them,</i>

442
00:34:36.151 --> 00:34:38.395
so they avoid paying tax.

443
00:34:38.485 --> 00:34:40.832
It's sorta like
a transit lounge for art?

444
00:34:40.922 --> 00:34:42.466
<i>Art, antiquities.</i>

445
00:34:42.556 --> 00:34:44.468
- <i>Anything of value, really.</i>
- <i>Anything?</i>

446
00:34:44.558 --> 00:34:46.104
Anything legal.

447
00:34:46.194 --> 00:34:48.340
But it's not unlike
the Swiss banking system.

448
00:34:48.430 --> 00:34:51.142
Opaque.

449
00:34:51.232 --> 00:34:54.846
As I'm sure you are aware,
most Freeports are just warehouses.

450
00:34:54.936 --> 00:34:57.514
But here we ensure that
you can actually enjoy...

451
00:34:57.604 --> 00:35:00.218
Rotas has assets in the Oslo Freeport.
I'm guessing it's there.

452
00:35:00.308 --> 00:35:02.354
And this way to the vaults!

453
00:35:02.444 --> 00:35:04.089
- Guessing?
- Guessing?

454
00:35:04.179 --> 00:35:06.523
We make trips there
four, five times a year.

455
00:35:06.613 --> 00:35:09.060
- To view art?
- And whatever it is he does.

456
00:35:09.150 --> 00:35:11.562
Turns out art's
of no importance to Andrei.

457
00:35:11.652 --> 00:35:13.487
But the Freeports are.

458
00:35:14.822 --> 00:35:16.968
The structure of the vaults
is based on the Pentagon.

459
00:35:17.058 --> 00:35:19.871
Each vault a separate structure
within the others.

460
00:35:19.961 --> 00:35:22.730
Damage to one structure
won't compromise the others.

461
00:35:34.109 --> 00:35:38.645
Some of our clients opt for
biometric access, straight in...

462
00:35:40.048 --> 00:35:41.458
off the tarmac.

463
00:35:41.548 --> 00:35:42.816
From the terminal?

464
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:45.596
From their private planes.

465
00:35:45.686 --> 00:35:47.731
Of course.

466
00:35:47.821 --> 00:35:50.501
Our logistics department
ships to and from

467
00:35:50.591 --> 00:35:51.702
any other Freeport in the world

468
00:35:51.792 --> 00:35:53.805
without customs inspection.

469
00:35:53.895 --> 00:35:55.706
<i>What are you hoping
to find in there?</i>

470
00:35:55.796 --> 00:35:56.875
You really wanna know?

471
00:35:56.965 --> 00:35:58.810
I'm not sure.

472
00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.246
Bring some lead-lined gloves.

473
00:36:01.336 --> 00:36:02.713
Jesus.

474
00:36:02.803 --> 00:36:04.182
It's nuclear.

475
00:36:04.272 --> 00:36:06.117
When you're on the tour,

476
00:36:06.207 --> 00:36:08.742
<i>pay attention
to the fire precautions.</i>

477
00:36:10.045 --> 00:36:11.122
Documents are
vulnerable to...

478
00:36:11.212 --> 00:36:12.723
Fire? Absolutely!

479
00:36:12.813 --> 00:36:14.826
No, I was going to say water
damage from the sprinkler systems.

480
00:36:14.916 --> 00:36:16.995
We don't use sprinklers.

481
00:36:17.085 --> 00:36:19.831
The facility is flooded
with halide gas,

482
00:36:19.921 --> 00:36:22.090
displacing all the air
within seconds.

483
00:36:23.358 --> 00:36:24.402
Can you show me?

484
00:36:24.492 --> 00:36:26.560
If I did, we'd suffocate.

485
00:36:27.728 --> 00:36:28.907
What about the staff?

486
00:36:28.997 --> 00:36:30.607
Halide only fills the vaults,

487
00:36:30.697 --> 00:36:32.509
they just have to get
into either corridor,

488
00:36:32.599 --> 00:36:34.578
and there is
a 10-second warning.

489
00:36:34.668 --> 00:36:36.580
At least you give them
10 seconds.

490
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:41.453
Well, sir, our clients
use us because we have no priorities

491
00:36:41.543 --> 00:36:43.188
above their property.

492
00:36:43.278 --> 00:36:44.122
Blimey.

493
00:36:44.212 --> 00:36:45.457
All doors are fireproof.

494
00:36:45.547 --> 00:36:48.592
Hydraulic closers, simple key
and electronic triggers.

495
00:36:48.682 --> 00:36:50.494
Surprisingly easy
once there's a lockdown.

496
00:36:50.584 --> 00:36:52.030
Why a lockdown?

497
00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:54.799
Power switches to fail-safes,
sealing the outer doors,

498
00:36:54.889 --> 00:36:57.758
but inner doors
revert to factory settings.

499
00:36:58.625 --> 00:36:59.804
And pickable locks.

500
00:36:59.894 --> 00:37:01.239
- Hmm.
- It's child's play, really.

501
00:37:01.329 --> 00:37:02.407
Child's play?

502
00:37:02.497 --> 00:37:03.975
They're inside
airport security.

503
00:37:04.065 --> 00:37:06.610
They have to worry about climate
control, not armed raids.

504
00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.680
So, how do we get enough
firepower through the perimeter

505
00:37:09.770 --> 00:37:11.638
to trigger
the lockdown procedure?

506
00:37:13.074 --> 00:37:14.752
Back wall of the Freeport.

507
00:37:14.842 --> 00:37:16.144
You've got something?

508
00:37:16.878 --> 00:37:19.224
Not gonna like it.

509
00:37:19.314 --> 00:37:21.026
You wanna crash a plane?

510
00:37:21.116 --> 00:37:23.560
Well, not from the air.
Don't be so dramatic.

511
00:37:23.650 --> 00:37:26.131
I want to run a jet
off the taxiway

512
00:37:26.221 --> 00:37:28.856
and breach the rear wall
and start a fire.

513
00:37:30.592 --> 00:37:32.770
Well, how big a plane?

514
00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:36.931
Well, that part
is a little dramatic.

515
00:37:37.565 --> 00:37:39.710
This is Mahir.

516
00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.879
His team'll work the plane.

517
00:37:40.969 --> 00:37:42.313
There can't be passengers.

518
00:37:42.403 --> 00:37:43.882
Norsk Freight.

519
00:37:43.972 --> 00:37:46.217
They use the hangar on
the west side of the Freeport.

520
00:37:46.307 --> 00:37:48.685
You want to crash a transport plane?
What about the crew?

521
00:37:48.775 --> 00:37:50.455
We pop the slides,
chuck 'em off.

522
00:37:50.545 --> 00:37:51.790
On the move?

523
00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:53.680
What's the problem?
They'll be fine.

524
00:37:54.549 --> 00:37:56.127
Well, it seems bold.

525
00:37:56.217 --> 00:37:58.997
Bold I'm fine with. I thought
you were gonna say nuts.

526
00:37:59.087 --> 00:38:00.331
And if you
get caught?

527
00:38:00.421 --> 00:38:01.366
We won't.

528
00:38:01.456 --> 00:38:03.201
And if you do?

529
00:38:03.291 --> 00:38:05.403
Everyone assumes terrorism,
but no one's died,

530
00:38:05.493 --> 00:38:08.672
so swift extradition
then lost in the system.

531
00:38:08.762 --> 00:38:10.375
It'll barely make the news.

532
00:38:10.465 --> 00:38:12.944
Oh, depends on the size
of your explosion.

533
00:38:13.034 --> 00:38:15.447
Well, actually, the gold bars
might get some play.

534
00:38:15.537 --> 00:38:16.915
Gold bars?

535
00:38:17.005 --> 00:38:18.883
Norsk Freight ships Treasury
gold once a month.

536
00:38:18.973 --> 00:38:22.320
Blow the back.
Drop it out on the runway.

537
00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:26.114
No one will be looking at the building.
I guarantee you.

538
00:38:28.782 --> 00:38:31.262
The space in the
center of the pentagon is too big.

539
00:38:31.352 --> 00:38:33.031
There's something there.

540
00:38:33.121 --> 00:38:36.157
Can't figure it out,
it's just not marked.

541
00:38:37.525 --> 00:38:38.735
That's 45 seconds.

542
00:38:38.825 --> 00:38:39.871
Ample.

543
00:38:39.961 --> 00:38:41.329
Won't you be running?

544
00:38:42.997 --> 00:38:44.375
All right, it's your turn.

545
00:38:44.465 --> 00:38:45.766
Start packing.

546
00:39:03.618 --> 00:39:04.851
Gentlemen, if you
would, through the detector, please.

547
00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.168
Sir?

548
00:39:10.258 --> 00:39:11.603
Oh.

549
00:39:11.693 --> 00:39:12.826
And, sir.

550
00:39:21.302 --> 00:39:23.780
I can offer you, perhaps,
a coffee, water?

551
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:25.517
No,
I'll take an espresso.

552
00:39:25.607 --> 00:39:27.385
- Sir?
- No, thank you.

553
00:39:27.475 --> 00:39:29.110
Excellent.

554
00:39:37.919 --> 00:39:39.797
Is everybody
on this plane vegetarian?

555
00:39:39.887 --> 00:39:42.090
Because all I got here
is vegetarian.

556
00:39:43.925 --> 00:39:46.271
So that looks like meat,

557
00:39:46.361 --> 00:39:48.940
but I think that looks vegetarian.
I think they both look vegetarian.

558
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:51.366
I don't really know.
It's confusing, ya know?

559
00:39:52.233 --> 00:39:53.101
Okay.

560
00:40:00.408 --> 00:40:01.842
This way, gentlemen.

561
00:40:17.558 --> 00:40:19.994
Gentlemen,
your assigned compartment.

562
00:40:30.672 --> 00:40:32.907
Carry on. Not the radio.

563
00:40:39.547 --> 00:40:40.915
Let's go.

564
00:40:56.798 --> 00:40:58.566
Uh...

565
00:41:11.245 --> 00:41:12.246
Yoga.

566
00:41:17.118 --> 00:41:19.220
Let's go! Now!

567
00:41:49.684 --> 00:41:50.651
Go, go, go!

568
00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.456
Right. Um...

569
00:42:42.570 --> 00:42:44.305
You said 10 seconds, right?

570
00:44:05.386 --> 00:44:07.221
There's
someone in here with us.

571
00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:24.205
- Need a hand?
- Actually, yes.

572
00:44:52.266 --> 00:44:53.467
Don't touch them!

573
00:44:54.201 --> 00:44:55.636
The hell happened here?

574
00:45:01.142 --> 00:45:03.144
It hasn't happened yet.

575
00:47:22.184 --> 00:47:23.929
Don't kill him!

576
00:47:24.019 --> 00:47:26.620
We need to know
if we've been compromised.

577
00:47:28.756 --> 00:47:30.802
Why are you here?

578
00:47:30.892 --> 00:47:32.971
Who are you?

579
00:47:33.061 --> 00:47:34.963
How'd you know we'd be here?

580
00:47:50.377 --> 00:47:52.279
We need to go.

581
00:47:57.219 --> 00:47:59.630
What happened to the other guy?

582
00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:01.990
Took care of him.

583
00:48:16.504 --> 00:48:18.182
Well,
I've seen too much.

584
00:48:18.272 --> 00:48:20.886
I'm still alive, which must
mean you've decided to trust me.

585
00:48:20.976 --> 00:48:22.586
Or maybe I lost my edge.

586
00:48:22.676 --> 00:48:24.678
Edge is still intact.

587
00:48:26.413 --> 00:48:28.315
There's a cold war.

588
00:48:28.716 --> 00:48:29.895
Nuclear?

589
00:48:29.985 --> 00:48:31.219
Temporal.

590
00:48:32.486 --> 00:48:33.664
Time travel?

591
00:48:33.754 --> 00:48:34.933
No.

592
00:48:35.023 --> 00:48:37.959
Technology that can invert
an object's entropy.

593
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:40.839
You mean reverse chronology.

594
00:48:40.929 --> 00:48:43.175
Like Feynman and Wheeler's notion
that a positron is an electron

595
00:48:43.265 --> 00:48:44.475
moving backwards in time?

596
00:48:44.565 --> 00:48:46.243
Sure, that's exactly
what I meant.

597
00:48:46.333 --> 00:48:47.913
I have a master's in physics.

598
00:48:48.003 --> 00:48:49.313
Well, try and keep up.

599
00:48:49.403 --> 00:48:51.016
The implications of this are...

600
00:48:51.106 --> 00:48:52.117
Beyond secret.

601
00:48:52.207 --> 00:48:53.819
Then why'd you bring me in?

602
00:48:53.909 --> 00:48:56.287
I thought we'd find a drawing
and a couple boxes of bullets.

603
00:48:56.377 --> 00:48:57.923
Not as surprised as I was.

604
00:48:58.013 --> 00:49:01.827
I'm going back to Mumbai
to get some answers.

605
00:49:01.917 --> 00:49:05.452
I'll set you up as a go-between.
But remember, to you...

606
00:49:06.387 --> 00:49:08.766
it's all about plutonium.

607
00:49:08.856 --> 00:49:10.367
And when we're done,
they'll kill you.

608
00:49:10.457 --> 00:49:13.304
Won't you have to
do that anyway?

609
00:49:13.394 --> 00:49:15.140
I'd rather it be my decision.

610
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:16.097
So would I.

611
00:49:16.998 --> 00:49:18.066
I think.

612
00:49:30.111 --> 00:49:30.979
Your work?

613
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:35.326
What did you find
in the vaults?

614
00:49:35.416 --> 00:49:38.196
Two antagonists. One inverted.

615
00:49:38.286 --> 00:49:42.299
We took out the regular one,
but the inverted one got away.

616
00:49:42.389 --> 00:49:43.902
Both emerged
at the same moment?

617
00:49:43.992 --> 00:49:45.469
Yeah.

618
00:49:45.559 --> 00:49:46.861
They were the same person.

619
00:49:48.129 --> 00:49:50.242
Sator's built a turnstile
in that vault.

620
00:49:50.332 --> 00:49:51.575
Turnstile?

621
00:49:51.665 --> 00:49:54.012
A machine for inverting.

622
00:49:54.102 --> 00:49:57.048
You've told me that technology
hasn't been invented yet.

623
00:49:57.138 --> 00:49:58.282
It hasn't.

624
00:49:58.372 --> 00:49:59.650
He's been given it
by the future.

625
00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:01.119
For what?

626
00:50:01.209 --> 00:50:03.744
You have the best chance of
finding out.

627
00:50:05.313 --> 00:50:06.657
- <i>Have you met him?</i>
- <i>I was close.</i>

628
00:50:06.747 --> 00:50:09.094
What if you have
something he needs?

629
00:50:09.184 --> 00:50:10.528
Such as?

630
00:50:10.618 --> 00:50:12.763
Plutonium-241.

631
00:50:12.853 --> 00:50:16.134
Sator tried to lift the only
loose 241 from under a CIA team

632
00:50:16.224 --> 00:50:18.769
at the opera siege in Kiev.

633
00:50:18.859 --> 00:50:20.205
He got the team.

634
00:50:20.295 --> 00:50:21.372
Not the 241.

635
00:50:21.462 --> 00:50:22.406
Who did?

636
00:50:22.496 --> 00:50:24.675
Ukrainian Security Services.

637
00:50:24.765 --> 00:50:27.012
It's moving to Tallinn
in a week.

638
00:50:27.102 --> 00:50:30.148
Helping an arms dealer steal
weapons-grade plutonium

639
00:50:30.238 --> 00:50:32.683
is unacceptable, Priya.

640
00:50:32.773 --> 00:50:34.252
I'm just gonna take him out.

641
00:50:34.342 --> 00:50:36.387
No, no, no.
Sator has to stay alive.

642
00:50:36.477 --> 00:50:39.423
He has to stay alive until
we know his part in things.

643
00:50:39.513 --> 00:50:40.892
Leverage the situation,

644
00:50:40.982 --> 00:50:43.228
without losing control
of the 241.

645
00:50:43.318 --> 00:50:44.863
It's too dangerous.

646
00:50:44.953 --> 00:50:47.098
A terrorist's bomb,
even one that can kill billions,

647
00:50:47.188 --> 00:50:50.135
is nothing compared with what will
happen if we don't stop Sator.

648
00:50:50.225 --> 00:50:51.735
From doing what?

649
00:50:51.825 --> 00:50:55.729
We are being attacked
by the future.

650
00:50:56.898 --> 00:50:59.968
And Sator's helping.
You have to find out how.

651
00:51:15.783 --> 00:51:18.063
I saw the news from Oslo.
Do you have the drawing?

652
00:51:18.153 --> 00:51:20.131
You don't have to worry
about it anymore.

653
00:51:20.221 --> 00:51:22.100
You destroyed it?

654
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:24.269
I didn't think
you'd want it back.

655
00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:25.369
Does he know?

656
00:51:25.459 --> 00:51:27.038
Not yet. So sit tight.

657
00:51:27.128 --> 00:51:28.874
Sit tight?

658
00:51:28.964 --> 00:51:31.009
Every day my son spends with that
monster, he thinks a little less of me.

659
00:51:31.099 --> 00:51:32.177
It won't be long.

660
00:51:32.267 --> 00:51:34.903
In the meantime, introduce me.

661
00:51:35.403 --> 00:51:37.148
As what?

662
00:51:37.238 --> 00:51:39.284
I'm a former first secretary from
the American Embassy in Riyadh.

663
00:51:39.374 --> 00:51:41.119
We met at a party last June.

664
00:51:41.209 --> 00:51:42.786
We were at a party in Riyadh,
but I don't think it was in June.

665
00:51:42.876 --> 00:51:45.190
It was June 29th. 7:00 or 7:30.

666
00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:48.059
Salmon was on the printed menu.
Swapped for sea bass on the night.

667
00:51:48.149 --> 00:51:49.961
Sator left early.
That's when we met.

668
00:51:50.051 --> 00:51:51.629
I came into Shipley's
in London.

669
00:51:51.719 --> 00:51:53.365
You ran into me here

670
00:51:53.455 --> 00:51:54.966
and wanna show me your yacht.

671
00:51:55.056 --> 00:51:57.401
He'll think we're
having an affair.

672
00:51:57.491 --> 00:51:58.535
Then he'll wanna meet me.

673
00:51:58.625 --> 00:51:59.637
Or have you killed.

674
00:51:59.727 --> 00:52:02.173
Let me worry about that.

675
00:52:02.263 --> 00:52:03.864
Did I look worried?

676
00:52:05.433 --> 00:52:06.677
Sleeps 70 with crew.

677
00:52:06.767 --> 00:52:09.413
Two helicopters.
Missile defenses.

678
00:52:09.503 --> 00:52:10.949
Afraid of pirates?

679
00:52:11.039 --> 00:52:13.550
Andrei lives playing
one government off the other.

680
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:15.387
The day they turn,
that's his refuge.

681
00:52:15.477 --> 00:52:16.754
May I join you?

682
00:52:16.844 --> 00:52:19.324
Not sure Volkov's taking
passengers just now.

683
00:52:19.414 --> 00:52:21.149
Then we'll take mine.

684
00:52:55.116 --> 00:52:56.117
Max!

685
00:52:57.684 --> 00:52:59.888
Who's the American?

686
00:53:01.189 --> 00:53:02.533
He's a friend.

687
00:53:02.623 --> 00:53:05.437
The man from Shipley's.

688
00:53:05.527 --> 00:53:07.929
Who you tried to have
beaten up.

689
00:53:08.829 --> 00:53:11.332
I ask again, who is he?

690
00:53:13.902 --> 00:53:16.547
We met in Riyadh last June
at the American Embassy.

691
00:53:16.637 --> 00:53:19.017
Good with fists for a diplomat.

692
00:53:19.107 --> 00:53:21.152
Paranoia's your department,
Andrei.

693
00:53:21.242 --> 00:53:24.588
He seems nice.
I invited him to the dinner.

694
00:53:24.678 --> 00:53:25.857
Max?

695
00:53:25.947 --> 00:53:29.227
He's visiting Pompeii
and Herculaneum.

696
00:53:29.317 --> 00:53:30.829
You just sent him off?

697
00:53:30.919 --> 00:53:33.530
I promised him I'd go with him.

698
00:53:33.620 --> 00:53:35.823
I explained you were busy.

699
00:53:37.292 --> 00:53:39.726
With your friend.

700
00:54:00.647 --> 00:54:02.593
Hey, easy, fella.

701
00:54:02.683 --> 00:54:05.053
Where I'm from,
you buy me dinner first.

702
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:18.066
- Mr. Sator.
- Don't bother.

703
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.970
Just tell me if you've
slept with my wife yet.

704
00:54:22.437 --> 00:54:24.172
Uh... No.

705
00:54:25.173 --> 00:54:26.174
Not yet.

706
00:54:27.475 --> 00:54:29.277
How would you like to die?

707
00:54:30.044 --> 00:54:30.889
Old.

708
00:54:30.979 --> 00:54:33.714
You chose the wrong profession.

709
00:54:35.216 --> 00:54:37.128
There's a walled garden
up the road.

710
00:54:37.218 --> 00:54:39.663
We are going to take you there,
cut your throat.

711
00:54:39.753 --> 00:54:42.934
Not across. In the middle,
like a hole.

712
00:54:43.024 --> 00:54:45.769
Then we take your balls
and we stuff them in the cut,

713
00:54:45.859 --> 00:54:47.428
block the windpipe.

714
00:54:48.096 --> 00:54:49.340
Complex.

715
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:51.742
It's very gratifying
to watch a man you don't like

716
00:54:51.832 --> 00:54:55.914
try to pull his own balls out
of his throat before he chokes.

717
00:54:56.004 --> 00:54:57.614
Is this how you treat
all your guests?

718
00:54:57.704 --> 00:54:59.274
We're finished.

719
00:55:03.311 --> 00:55:04.312
Do you like opera?

720
00:55:11.219 --> 00:55:12.330
Well?

721
00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:13.787
Not here.

722
00:55:17.192 --> 00:55:17.936
You sail?

723
00:55:18.026 --> 00:55:19.537
I've messed around on boats.

724
00:55:19.627 --> 00:55:22.430
Be on the dock at 8:00 ready to
do more than mess around.

725
00:55:23.064 --> 00:55:24.065
8:00 a.m.

726
00:55:38.379 --> 00:55:40.825
<i>Max has missed
too much school this year.</i>

727
00:55:40.915 --> 00:55:42.527
I'm taking him back to England.

728
00:55:42.617 --> 00:55:43.862
The school won't be okay with
him missing so much of the term.

729
00:55:43.952 --> 00:55:46.798
- Yes, they will.
- Can I finish?

730
00:55:46.888 --> 00:55:48.665
You have all the trappings
of a king.

731
00:55:48.755 --> 00:55:51.302
We both know you're a grubby
little man playing power games

732
00:55:51.392 --> 00:55:53.428
with a wife who
doesn't love you anymore.

733
00:55:54.629 --> 00:55:56.164
You seem...

734
00:55:57.265 --> 00:55:59.100
spirited today.

735
00:56:00.635 --> 00:56:03.137
- Do I?
- Yes, you do.

736
00:56:09.143 --> 00:56:11.489
Were you worried
it had been destroyed?

737
00:56:11.579 --> 00:56:15.894
Rest assured, instinct told me
to remove it from the vault.

738
00:56:15.984 --> 00:56:18.519
I've always had instincts
about the future.

739
00:56:20.121 --> 00:56:23.358
That's how I built this life
you no longer value.

740
00:56:38.506 --> 00:56:40.241
Sailing or diving?

741
00:56:57.392 --> 00:56:58.893
Rising!

742
00:57:23.217 --> 00:57:25.830
What do you know about opera?

743
00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:29.000
In 2008, a remote
Russian missile station

744
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.803
was overwhelmed
and held for a week.

745
00:57:31.893 --> 00:57:33.538
When the station was retaken,

746
00:57:33.628 --> 00:57:37.565
241 on one warhead was three
quarters of a kilo lighter.

747
00:57:41.636 --> 00:57:43.481
The missing 241

748
00:57:43.571 --> 00:57:46.750
surfaced at the opera house
siege in Kiev on the 14th.

749
00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.842
Coming about!

750
00:58:06.694 --> 00:58:09.063
What do you propose?

751
00:58:09.831 --> 00:58:10.808
Partnership.

752
00:58:10.898 --> 00:58:12.744
I wouldn't partner with you.

753
00:58:12.834 --> 00:58:17.081
You can take care of yourself.
You have no record.

754
00:58:17.171 --> 00:58:19.284
Someone in the arms trade,
with training,

755
00:58:19.374 --> 00:58:21.085
who knows how to
cover his tracks.

756
00:58:21.175 --> 00:58:22.487
Not that shocking.

757
00:58:22.577 --> 00:58:24.822
For an intelligence agent.

758
00:58:24.912 --> 00:58:26.948
Right!

759
00:58:29.650 --> 00:58:31.085
Burn in hell, Andrei.

760
00:58:38.292 --> 00:58:40.104
You can't jibe
a boat like this!

761
00:58:40.194 --> 00:58:41.596
You can if you have to.

762
00:59:09.290 --> 00:59:11.336
- Kat...
- Why didn't you let him drown?

763
00:59:11.426 --> 00:59:12.904
I need him.

764
00:59:12.994 --> 00:59:14.072
What, to sell guns?

765
00:59:14.162 --> 00:59:15.406
I'm not who you think I am.

766
00:59:15.496 --> 00:59:16.607
Well, that I know.

767
00:59:16.697 --> 00:59:19.210
He showed me the drawing.

768
00:59:19.300 --> 00:59:21.646
I'm sorry.
I had to get close to him.

769
00:59:21.736 --> 00:59:23.816
I don't know what you think
your husband does...

770
00:59:23.906 --> 00:59:26.551
Oh, we both know
he's an arms dealer.

771
00:59:26.641 --> 00:59:28.019
He's so much more.

772
00:59:28.109 --> 00:59:29.921
What, then?

773
00:59:30.011 --> 00:59:33.147
Andrei Sator holds all of our
lives in his hands, not just yours.

774
00:59:41.088 --> 00:59:42.767
Mr. Sator wants to see you.

775
00:59:42.857 --> 00:59:43.724
Okay.

776
00:59:44.492 --> 00:59:46.304
Now.

777
00:59:46.394 --> 00:59:48.596
Uh, he wants to see me
without pants?

778
00:59:54.669 --> 00:59:56.280
- Trust me.
- Save it.

779
00:59:56.370 --> 00:59:58.639
I'm not falling for it twice.

780
01:00:00.842 --> 01:00:02.310
You have a better option?

781
01:00:05.112 --> 01:00:07.058
Whatever it takes
to get what you want.

782
01:00:07.148 --> 01:00:09.750
Not a second's thought
for me or my son.

783
01:00:14.255 --> 01:00:16.557
What do you think
he's gonna do to me now?

784
01:00:28.035 --> 01:00:29.570
Try not to use it.

785
01:00:31.572 --> 01:00:33.441
On anyone.

786
01:00:38.679 --> 01:00:40.081
Enough.

787
01:00:43.484 --> 01:00:46.521
See? Pulse of a man
half my age.

788
01:00:49.724 --> 01:00:51.425
Drink with me.

789
01:00:53.261 --> 01:00:55.673
It seems I now owe you my life.

790
01:00:55.763 --> 01:00:56.809
It's nothing.

791
01:00:56.899 --> 01:00:58.911
My life is not nothing.

792
01:00:59.001 --> 01:01:01.612
And I don't like to be in debt.

793
01:01:01.702 --> 01:01:03.381
Then pay me.

794
01:01:03.471 --> 01:01:05.706
No retribution
against your wife.

795
01:01:09.011 --> 01:01:11.412
You think she released
my harness?

796
01:01:14.782 --> 01:01:17.061
It was my own mistake.

797
01:01:17.151 --> 01:01:19.130
Then help me steal the 241.

798
01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:21.466
I need resources.
It's weapons-grade plutonium.

799
01:01:21.556 --> 01:01:23.601
That means special handling,
containment facilities...

800
01:01:23.691 --> 01:01:25.226
I know what it means.

801
01:01:27.295 --> 01:01:30.498
You lecture me about radiation?

802
01:01:31.299 --> 01:01:33.110
Andrei Sator,

803
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:38.049
digging plutonium from the
rubble of my city as a teenager.

804
01:01:38.139 --> 01:01:39.206
Where?

805
01:01:41.842 --> 01:01:43.778
<i>Stalsk-12.</i>

806
01:01:45.179 --> 01:01:46.380
<i>My home.</i>

807
01:01:49.116 --> 01:01:53.654
One part of a warhead exploded at
ground level, scattering the others.

808
01:01:55.289 --> 01:01:58.092
They needed people
to find the plutonium.

809
01:02:00.028 --> 01:02:01.974
It became my first contract.

810
01:02:02.064 --> 01:02:05.366
<i>Nobody else even bid.
They thought it was a death sentence.</i>

811
01:02:08.202 --> 01:02:09.403
But...

812
01:02:10.906 --> 01:02:13.874
<i>one man's probability
of death...</i>

813
01:02:15.710 --> 01:02:20.147
...is another man's possibility
for a life.

814
01:02:22.583 --> 01:02:25.696
<i>I staked my claim
in the new Russia.</i>

815
01:02:25.786 --> 01:02:30.568
Even now, my company is the only
one to operate in the ruins.

816
01:02:30.658 --> 01:02:33.704
The 241 is being transported
through northern Europe,

817
01:02:33.794 --> 01:02:39.210
on its way to the long-term
nuclear storage depot in Trieste.

818
01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.669
I'm told you have resources
in Tallinn.

819
01:02:46.374 --> 01:02:48.753
Stay with us tonight.

820
01:02:48.843 --> 01:02:50.544
I insist.

821
01:03:17.906 --> 01:03:19.051
What do you want?

822
01:03:19.141 --> 01:03:21.342
We're going to talk
about today.

823
01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:23.154
No, we're not.

824
01:03:23.244 --> 01:03:24.445
No?

825
01:03:26.247 --> 01:03:27.625
We'll see.

826
01:03:27.715 --> 01:03:29.327
Don't think for a second
you can treat me

827
01:03:29.417 --> 01:03:31.485
like you treat
your other women.

828
01:03:33.354 --> 01:03:35.489
And, uh...

829
01:03:36.357 --> 01:03:39.236
how do you imagine...

830
01:03:39.326 --> 01:03:40.738
I treat these other women, huh?

831
01:03:40.828 --> 01:03:43.441
You think I force them
into conversation?

832
01:03:43.531 --> 01:03:45.077
You wanna be quiet, fine.

833
01:03:45.167 --> 01:03:46.867
You can bite down on that.

834
01:03:49.470 --> 01:03:53.507
Even a soul as blank and brittle
as yours needs a response.

835
01:03:54.742 --> 01:03:57.022
Is fear and pain
enough, Andrei?

836
01:03:57.112 --> 01:03:58.322
That's all I have to offer you.

837
01:03:58.412 --> 01:04:00.058
Well, that will
have to do, then.

838
01:04:00.148 --> 01:04:02.894
Why didn't you just let me go?

839
01:04:02.984 --> 01:04:04.986
Because...

840
01:04:06.988 --> 01:04:11.692
if I can't have you...

841
01:04:13.161 --> 01:04:16.774
no one else can.

842
01:04:16.864 --> 01:04:19.710
And if you touch me,
I scream so loud he hears.

843
01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.679
You think I let him interfere?

844
01:04:21.769 --> 01:04:24.615
If he tried,
you'd have to kill him.

845
01:04:24.705 --> 01:04:25.740
End of deal.

846
01:04:27.308 --> 01:04:29.710
So you leave me alone.

847
01:04:31.245 --> 01:04:33.247
Not now!

848
01:06:52.853 --> 01:06:57.125
Ninety-eight.
Not bad for such exertion.

849
01:07:07.768 --> 01:07:09.905
He was at the window.

850
01:07:11.538 --> 01:07:12.908
I was curious.

851
01:07:14.009 --> 01:07:17.155
My property
shouldn't concern you.

852
01:07:17.245 --> 01:07:18.756
Who are you?

853
01:07:18.846 --> 01:07:20.826
How do you come by your
information about the opera?

854
01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:25.297
You wouldn't do business with someone
who wasn't savvy enough to be recruited.

855
01:07:25.387 --> 01:07:28.834
Hell, the CIA provides two thirds
of the market for fissile material.

856
01:07:28.924 --> 01:07:32.469
They're usually buying,
not selling.

857
01:07:32.559 --> 01:07:35.273
But we do live
in a twilight world.

858
01:07:35.363 --> 01:07:36.875
Is that Whitman? Pretty.

859
01:07:36.965 --> 01:07:38.934
Next warning's a bullet
in the brain.

860
01:07:41.336 --> 01:07:43.581
No balls in my throat?

861
01:07:43.671 --> 01:07:46.251
There will be no time
for such things...

862
01:07:46.341 --> 01:07:47.819
in Tallinn.

863
01:07:47.909 --> 01:07:51.857
You make your way there.
I want Volkov on your team.

864
01:07:51.947 --> 01:07:53.148
No.

865
01:07:55.984 --> 01:07:59.630
I spring the material.
You pay me off.

866
01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.432
Your wife does the exchange.

867
01:08:01.522 --> 01:08:02.766
I never involve her
in my business.

868
01:08:02.856 --> 01:08:05.070
Yeah, that's why I trust her.

869
01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:06.872
Put him ashore.

870
01:08:06.962 --> 01:08:08.340
How do I
contact you?

871
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:09.573
You don't.

872
01:08:09.663 --> 01:08:11.166
How do you advance me
the funds?

873
01:08:14.868 --> 01:08:18.073
Handle the plutonium
better than that.

874
01:08:28.016 --> 01:08:29.493
<i>What did you find on the gold?</i>

875
01:08:29.583 --> 01:08:31.395
<i>No franks,
no mold marks. Nothing.</i>

876
01:08:31.485 --> 01:08:33.798
- How?
- Dead drops.

877
01:08:33.888 --> 01:08:36.935
He buries his time capsule,
transmits the location,

878
01:08:37.025 --> 01:08:40.571
then digs it up to collect the
inverted materials they sent.

879
01:08:40.661 --> 01:08:43.574
Seemingly instantaneous.
Where's he bury it?

880
01:08:43.664 --> 01:08:46.677
Some place that won't be
discovered for centuries.

881
01:08:46.767 --> 01:08:48.813
What did the soil samples show?

882
01:08:48.903 --> 01:08:51.216
Northern Europe, Asia.

883
01:08:51.306 --> 01:08:52.750
<i>Radioactive.</i>

884
01:08:52.840 --> 01:08:55.676
Everything salvaged from Oslo's
been shipped here.

885
01:08:56.378 --> 01:08:57.721
Why am I here?

886
01:08:57.811 --> 01:09:01.192
I don't trust anyone else
to assess the pieces.

887
01:09:01.282 --> 01:09:03.929
<i>Via convoy through
downtown, what's the thinking?</i>

888
01:09:04.019 --> 01:09:06.865
Crowded. Unpredictable
traffic patterns.

889
01:09:06.955 --> 01:09:09.267
It's almost impossible
to plan an ambush.

890
01:09:09.357 --> 01:09:11.535
They have a point.

891
01:09:11.625 --> 01:09:13.104
Is the convoy monitored
from the air?

892
01:09:13.194 --> 01:09:16.841
Tracked by GPS. One wrong turn,
in come the cavalry.

893
01:09:16.931 --> 01:09:18.209
<i>We need big guns.</i>

894
01:09:18.299 --> 01:09:20.502
Guns that make the point
without being fired.

895
01:09:20.601 --> 01:09:24.115
We need a fast car that doesn't
look fast. Four heavy vehicles.

896
01:09:24.205 --> 01:09:25.749
All different.

897
01:09:25.839 --> 01:09:28.786
Bus, coach, 18-wheeler.
One of them has to be a fire truck.

898
01:09:28.876 --> 01:09:32.157
Most of all, we have to set this
up with nothing in the record.

899
01:09:32.247 --> 01:09:34.192
Nothing electronic,
nothing paper.

900
01:09:34.282 --> 01:09:38.629
I don't want Sator ambushing us
once we spring the material.

901
01:09:38.719 --> 01:09:41.755
His ignorance is our only
protection.

902
01:10:18.893 --> 01:10:20.295
You see, Kat?

903
01:10:21.262 --> 01:10:23.664
Some of my favorites.

904
01:10:24.899 --> 01:10:29.613
Singed but, uh, salvageable,
wouldn't you say?

905
01:10:29.703 --> 01:10:32.350
- That's not my area of expertise.
- Ah, that's right.

906
01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:36.787
You would never have anything
to do with such things.

907
01:10:36.877 --> 01:10:39.491
But this is where
our worlds collide.

908
01:10:39.581 --> 01:10:41.092
What is this, Andrei?

909
01:10:41.182 --> 01:10:44.385
You know perfectly well
what it is, Kat.

910
01:10:47.222 --> 01:10:49.000
The filthy business

911
01:10:49.090 --> 01:10:52.370
that put those clothes on your
back and our boy in his school,

912
01:10:52.460 --> 01:10:54.996
that you thought you could
negotiate your way around.

913
01:10:56.264 --> 01:10:58.299
The convoy's due downtown in ten.

914
01:11:04.771 --> 01:11:06.051
Time to go.

915
01:11:06.141 --> 01:11:07.651
I'm not going anywhere
with him.

916
01:11:07.741 --> 01:11:08.876
Look at me!

917
01:11:10.411 --> 01:11:12.589
And understand,

918
01:11:12.679 --> 01:11:15.160
you don't negotiate
with a tiger.

919
01:11:15.250 --> 01:11:19.297
You admire a tiger
until he turns on you

920
01:11:19.387 --> 01:11:23.757
and you feel its true
fucking nature!

921
01:11:24.359 --> 01:11:25.759
Don't.

922
01:11:26.594 --> 01:11:28.829
You stay right there.

923
01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.602
Green. Two minutes.

924
01:11:58.226 --> 01:11:59.504
You are not going to kill me.

925
01:11:59.594 --> 01:12:01.439
I already tried.

926
01:12:01.529 --> 01:12:02.874
You pushed me off a boat.

927
01:12:02.964 --> 01:12:04.943
You are not going to shoot me
in cold blood.

928
01:12:05.033 --> 01:12:07.312
My blood's not cold, Andrei.

929
01:12:07.402 --> 01:12:10.871
No, but you're not
angry enough.

930
01:12:12.307 --> 01:12:16.010
Because anger scars over
into despair.

931
01:12:17.878 --> 01:12:20.248
I look in your eyes...

932
01:12:21.649 --> 01:12:23.351
I see despair.

933
01:12:27.155 --> 01:12:30.435
Vengeful bitch! Living off me!

934
01:12:30.525 --> 01:12:32.170
Thinking that you're better!

935
01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:33.328
Enough!

936
01:12:57.751 --> 01:13:00.421
Tell me everything
as it happens.

937
01:13:02.724 --> 01:13:04.791
Seal me this side.

938
01:13:21.875 --> 01:13:24.355
Yellow, 60 seconds.

939
01:13:24.445 --> 01:13:26.080
60. Check.

940
01:13:40.695 --> 01:13:43.441
Blue, 45 seconds.

941
01:13:43.531 --> 01:13:45.233
Blue, 45, check.

942
01:14:01.683 --> 01:14:04.185
Okay, Red.
Coming to you.

943
01:14:13.695 --> 01:14:15.396
Three trucks in place.

944
01:14:19.233 --> 01:14:22.136
Watch everything.
Give me all the details.

945
01:15:07.181 --> 01:15:08.616
All right, everyone set?

946
01:15:14.489 --> 01:15:16.491
And five...

947
01:15:17.392 --> 01:15:18.926
four...

948
01:15:19.694 --> 01:15:20.661
three...

949
01:15:21.763 --> 01:15:22.964
two...

950
01:15:24.899 --> 01:15:26.100
<i>one.</i>

951
01:15:48.656 --> 01:15:49.690
Go, Yellow!

952
01:15:53.461 --> 01:15:54.807
We got a problem!

953
01:15:54.897 --> 01:15:57.698
Backup, we need backup! Shit!

954
01:18:04.091 --> 01:18:06.093
Check the
radio chatter.

955
01:18:22.810 --> 01:18:25.256
I've seen samples of
encapsulation in every weapons class.

956
01:18:25.346 --> 01:18:26.925
This is not one of them.

957
01:18:27.015 --> 01:18:28.683
That's what he's after.

958
01:18:32.286 --> 01:18:33.464
Can't understand this.

959
01:18:33.554 --> 01:18:35.132
You said you spoke Estonian.

960
01:18:35.222 --> 01:18:36.802
It's not Estonian.

961
01:18:36.892 --> 01:18:38.159
It's backwards.

962
01:18:43.297 --> 01:18:44.699
The hell is that?

963
01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:01.415
Go, go, go!

964
01:19:47.828 --> 01:19:49.808
Don't give it to him.

965
01:19:49.898 --> 01:19:51.075
This isn't plutonium.

966
01:19:51.165 --> 01:19:52.533
It's worse than that,
God damn it!

967
01:20:11.153 --> 01:20:12.386
Sorry.

968
01:20:28.335 --> 01:20:29.503
He's getting away.

969
01:20:31.305 --> 01:20:32.450
He left her
in the car!

970
01:20:32.540 --> 01:20:34.976
Go after her, go! Go, go, go!

971
01:20:48.355 --> 01:20:49.724
Pull up alongside!

972
01:21:05.339 --> 01:21:07.808
Come on, come on. Closer!

973
01:21:11.512 --> 01:21:13.314
Keep it steady, keep it steady!

974
01:21:15.217 --> 01:21:16.885
Hurry up!

975
01:21:18.285 --> 01:21:19.620
Please!

976
01:21:55.656 --> 01:21:58.526
All right, sit tight.
I'm calling the cavalry.

977
01:21:59.293 --> 01:22:00.728
What cavalry?

978
01:23:04.825 --> 01:23:07.095
If you are not telling
the truth, she dies.

979
01:23:09.663 --> 01:23:11.109
I don't know what you're
talkin' about.

980
01:23:11.199 --> 01:23:13.534
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

981
01:23:15.603 --> 01:23:17.215
- Who told you that?
- Just tell me now,

982
01:23:17.305 --> 01:23:18.572
is it really in the BMW?

983
01:23:19.975 --> 01:23:20.919
I don't know.

984
01:23:21.009 --> 01:23:22.376
Tell me or
I'll shoot her again!

985
01:23:24.279 --> 01:23:25.322
Leave her alone!

986
01:23:25.412 --> 01:23:26.757
Kill him!

987
01:23:26.847 --> 01:23:28.716
I don't have time
to negotiate.

988
01:23:34.421 --> 01:23:35.533
- Listen to me!
- Three.

989
01:23:35.623 --> 01:23:36.600
I can help you.

990
01:23:36.690 --> 01:23:38.103
- Help me!
- Two.

991
01:23:38.193 --> 01:23:39.204
Please!

992
01:23:39.294 --> 01:23:40.527
- Don't!
- One.

993
01:23:44.698 --> 01:23:46.334
Next one's a bullet
to the head.

994
01:23:48.036 --> 01:23:49.480
- No!
- One.

995
01:23:49.570 --> 01:23:51.249
Two. Three.

996
01:23:51.339 --> 01:23:52.673
Okay! Okay.

997
01:23:53.341 --> 01:23:55.519
The car. The BMW.

998
01:23:55.609 --> 01:23:56.922
I left it in the BMW.

999
01:23:57.012 --> 01:23:58.379
We're going to check this is real.

1000
01:24:00.781 --> 01:24:02.828
It's in the glove box!

1001
01:24:02.918 --> 01:24:04.920
Where did you leave it?

1002
01:24:05.753 --> 01:24:07.698
Car or fire truck, which one?

1003
01:24:07.788 --> 01:24:10.467
Which vehicle did you leave it in?
I need to know before I go out there.

1004
01:24:10.557 --> 01:24:11.659
I already told you.

1005
01:24:12.726 --> 01:24:14.172
I believe you.

1006
01:24:14.262 --> 01:24:16.463
You wanted her here,
I hope you'll be happy...

1007
01:24:28.977 --> 01:24:30.421
Clear!

1008
01:24:30.511 --> 01:24:32.190
Wheeler, go check
the other side.

1009
01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:33.524
You two.

1010
01:24:33.614 --> 01:24:34.860
Where did he go?

1011
01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:35.951
The past.

1012
01:24:58.907 --> 01:25:00.252
It's in
the glove box!

1013
01:25:00.342 --> 01:25:03.278
We're going to check
this is real.

1014
01:25:05.914 --> 01:25:08.392
- Three, two, one.
- Okay, okay...

1015
01:25:08.482 --> 01:25:10.285
Next one's a bullet to the head.

1016
01:25:11.652 --> 01:25:13.899
- No! No!
- One.

1017
01:25:13.989 --> 01:25:15.901
- Listen to me.
- Two.

1018
01:25:15.991 --> 01:25:17.068
Three.

1019
01:25:17.158 --> 01:25:18.736
I can help you.

1020
01:25:18.826 --> 01:25:20.839
I don't have time to negotiate.

1021
01:25:20.929 --> 01:25:22.263
Tell me
or I'll shoot her again.

1022
01:25:23.932 --> 01:25:25.176
- Leave her alone!
- Tell me now,

1023
01:25:25.266 --> 01:25:26.477
is it really in the BMW?

1024
01:25:26.567 --> 01:25:28.013
I don't know.

1025
01:25:28.103 --> 01:25:30.514
You left it in the car,
not the fire truck, right?

1026
01:25:30.604 --> 01:25:32.150
Who told you that?

1027
01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:34.219
If you're not telling
the truth, she dies.

1028
01:25:34.309 --> 01:25:36.510
I don't know
what you're talking about.

1029
01:25:48.622 --> 01:25:50.058
- Medic!
- Check in.

1030
01:25:51.426 --> 01:25:53.104
She's been shot?

1031
01:25:53.194 --> 01:25:55.063
Bring her back,
this side.

1032
01:25:56.498 --> 01:25:58.199
Was she shot with
an inverted round?

1033
01:26:03.604 --> 01:26:05.773
This is Ives. He's one of us.

1034
01:26:07.242 --> 01:26:09.187
"Us"! Who are these guys?

1035
01:26:09.277 --> 01:26:11.389
Priya's. Ours.

1036
01:26:11.479 --> 01:26:13.124
How did Sator know
about the ambush?

1037
01:26:13.214 --> 01:26:14.826
It's posterity.

1038
01:26:14.916 --> 01:26:16.895
An ambush in the middle of the
street can't stay out of the records.

1039
01:26:16.985 --> 01:26:20.198
Bullshit! He knew every move
we made! Every one of 'em.

1040
01:26:20.288 --> 01:26:21.498
Somebody talked. Who was it?

1041
01:26:21.588 --> 01:26:23.567
- Was it you?
- No. No.

1042
01:26:23.657 --> 01:26:25.703
At every stage,
you've known too much.

1043
01:26:25.793 --> 01:26:28.762
I'm going to ask you again.

1044
01:26:29.497 --> 01:26:31.698
Did you talk?

1045
01:26:33.234 --> 01:26:34.712
Nobody talked.

1046
01:26:34.802 --> 01:26:37.238
They're running
a temporal pincer movement.

1047
01:26:37.972 --> 01:26:39.150
A what?

1048
01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:43.421
The pincer movement.
But not in space, in time.

1049
01:26:43.511 --> 01:26:45.522
Half his team moves forward
through the event.

1050
01:26:45.612 --> 01:26:48.827
He monitors them, and then attacks
at the end moving backwards,

1051
01:26:48.917 --> 01:26:50.462
knowing everything.

1052
01:26:50.552 --> 01:26:52.563
Except for where
I stashed the plutonium.

1053
01:26:52.653 --> 01:26:54.232
Which isn't really plutonium,
is it?

1054
01:26:54.322 --> 01:26:55.800
I told you
it was what he was after.

1055
01:26:55.890 --> 01:26:58.592
And you just told him
where it was.

1056
01:26:59.327 --> 01:27:01.572
I lied.

1057
01:27:01.662 --> 01:27:04.442
Jesus.
You lied about it?

1058
01:27:04.532 --> 01:27:08.947
He couldn't verify inside the room.
He'd have shot her anyway.

1059
01:27:09.037 --> 01:27:11.483
Lying is standard
operating procedure.

1060
01:27:11.573 --> 01:27:12.750
It's spread too far.

1061
01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:13.818
Meaning what?

1062
01:27:13.908 --> 01:27:15.153
She's gonna die.

1063
01:27:15.243 --> 01:27:16.921
Standard
operating procedure.

1064
01:27:17.011 --> 01:27:18.823
Can't you help her?
Can we do something?

1065
01:27:18.913 --> 01:27:21.826
Can't we stabilize the inverse
radiation by inverting the patient?

1066
01:27:21.916 --> 01:27:23.028
Takes days.

1067
01:27:23.118 --> 01:27:24.796
Let's go.

1068
01:27:24.886 --> 01:27:27.198
We took control of this machine
minutes ago. Before that, it's Sator's.

1069
01:27:27.288 --> 01:27:29.566
How long is she gonna live
on this side?

1070
01:27:29.656 --> 01:27:31.302
Three hours, tops.

1071
01:27:31.392 --> 01:27:32.837
I'm taking her through.

1072
01:27:32.927 --> 01:27:35.040
I'm not gonna let her die.
I'll take my chances.

1073
01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:37.741
There's no way of
bringing you back.

1074
01:27:37.831 --> 01:27:39.144
We find another machine.

1075
01:27:39.234 --> 01:27:40.767
A week ago? Where?

1076
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:44.115
Oslo.

1077
01:27:44.205 --> 01:27:46.750
That facility's inside
an airport security perimeter.

1078
01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.585
It's impregnable.

1079
01:27:48.675 --> 01:27:50.721
Mmm... It wasn't last week.

1080
01:27:50.811 --> 01:27:52.323
We're going in.

1081
01:27:52.413 --> 01:27:53.680
You might as well help us.

1082
01:27:54.848 --> 01:27:56.027
This is a proving window.

1083
01:27:56.117 --> 01:27:57.462
As you approach the turnstile,

1084
01:27:57.552 --> 01:27:59.364
if you don't see yourself
in the proving window,

1085
01:27:59.454 --> 01:28:00.532
do not enter the machine.

1086
01:28:00.622 --> 01:28:02.000
Why not?

1087
01:28:02.090 --> 01:28:03.401
If you don't see yourself
reverse-exit a machine,

1088
01:28:03.491 --> 01:28:04.536
then you ain't getting out.

1089
01:28:04.626 --> 01:28:07.172
- Is that gonna work?
- Yeah.

1090
01:28:07.262 --> 01:28:08.973
See for yourself.

1091
01:28:09.063 --> 01:28:11.132
There's your answer. Let's go.

1092
01:28:35.756 --> 01:28:37.102
She's stabilizing
slowly.

1093
01:28:37.192 --> 01:28:38.769
I'll clean and close,
but the rest is time.

1094
01:28:38.859 --> 01:28:40.138
How long does she need?

1095
01:28:40.228 --> 01:28:43.774
Four, five days.
A week to be sure.

1096
01:28:43.864 --> 01:28:45.443
Hey, Neil. Find a way
to get us to Oslo.

1097
01:28:45.533 --> 01:28:46.733
I'm going back out there.

1098
01:28:48.670 --> 01:28:50.482
To do what?

1099
01:28:50.572 --> 01:28:52.383
To stop Sator from getting away
with whatever it is I just gave him.

1100
01:28:52.473 --> 01:28:54.751
You didn't. You lied
about where it was.

1101
01:28:54.841 --> 01:28:56.521
Wait.

1102
01:28:56.611 --> 01:28:57.889
You're going out there for her.

1103
01:28:57.979 --> 01:28:59.623
He threatened to kill her
in the past.

1104
01:28:59.713 --> 01:29:01.549
If he does,
what happens to her here?

1105
01:29:02.816 --> 01:29:04.695
That's unknowable.

1106
01:29:04.785 --> 01:29:06.965
If you're there to make a change,
you're not here to observe its effect.

1107
01:29:07.055 --> 01:29:08.533
What do you believe?

1108
01:29:08.623 --> 01:29:10.767
What's happened's happened.

1109
01:29:10.857 --> 01:29:13.538
We need to save her,
here and now.

1110
01:29:13.628 --> 01:29:17.308
If you go back out there, you might
hand him exactly what he's after.

1111
01:29:17.398 --> 01:29:19.643
Don't let them
take her back through there.

1112
01:29:19.733 --> 01:29:20.578
Okay?

1113
01:29:20.668 --> 01:29:22.337
We can't stay here.

1114
01:29:23.271 --> 01:29:24.916
We don't have a lot of time.

1115
01:29:25.006 --> 01:29:28.052
So why don't you find us
a nice, cozy shipping container

1116
01:29:28.142 --> 01:29:30.455
that's just come off a ship
from Oslo?

1117
01:29:30.545 --> 01:29:31.990
This is cowboy shit.

1118
01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.525
You have no idea what you're
getting yourself into

1119
01:29:33.615 --> 01:29:34.926
if you go through that door.

1120
01:29:35.016 --> 01:29:36.760
Well, I'm going,
so any tips would be welcome.

1121
01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:38.630
Wheeler, brief him.

1122
01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.498
You'll need your own air.

1123
01:29:40.588 --> 01:29:43.601
Regular air won't pass through
the membranes of inverted lungs.

1124
01:29:43.691 --> 01:29:45.103
Number one rule:

1125
01:29:45.193 --> 01:29:47.372
don't come into contact
with your forward self.

1126
01:29:47.462 --> 01:29:50.308
It's the whole point of these
barriers and protective suits.

1127
01:29:50.398 --> 01:29:51.576
We don't have time.

1128
01:29:51.666 --> 01:29:54.145
Well, if your particles
come into contact...

1129
01:29:54.235 --> 01:29:55.213
What?

1130
01:29:55.303 --> 01:29:56.314
Annihilation.

1131
01:29:56.404 --> 01:29:57.982
That would be bad, right?

1132
01:29:58.072 --> 01:30:02.053
When you exit the air lock,
take a moment to orient yourself.

1133
01:30:02.143 --> 01:30:04.422
Things will feel strange.

1134
01:30:04.512 --> 01:30:06.524
When you run,
the wind will be at your back.

1135
01:30:06.614 --> 01:30:09.894
You encounter fire,
ice will form on your clothes

1136
01:30:09.984 --> 01:30:11.762
as the transfer of heat
is reversed.

1137
01:30:11.852 --> 01:30:16.601
Gravity will feel normal but appear
reversed for the world around you.

1138
01:30:16.691 --> 01:30:19.470
You may experience distortions
in your vision and hearing.

1139
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:20.838
This is normal.

1140
01:30:20.928 --> 01:30:22.473
- Can I drive a car?
- Cowboy shit.

1141
01:30:22.563 --> 01:30:24.175
I can't vouch
for the handling.

1142
01:30:24.265 --> 01:30:26.644
Friction and wind resistance
are reversed.

1143
01:30:26.734 --> 01:30:28.846
You are inverted.
The world is not.

1144
01:30:28.936 --> 01:30:30.682
Was the transponder
on the case?

1145
01:30:30.772 --> 01:30:32.350
We've tossed that case.

1146
01:30:32.440 --> 01:30:35.053
I'm moving backwards.
It's the ball I have to follow.

1147
01:30:35.143 --> 01:30:37.078
Give me the reader.

1148
01:30:40.948 --> 01:30:42.350
Okay.

1149
01:30:43.184 --> 01:30:44.818
You ready?

1150
01:33:36.324 --> 01:33:39.270
<i>The material's not in the case.</i>

1151
01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.497
<i>Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i>

1152
01:33:43.164 --> 01:33:44.776
<i>He was lying.</i>

1153
01:33:44.866 --> 01:33:46.677
<i>It wasn't in the BMW.</i>

1154
01:33:46.767 --> 01:33:47.768
<i>So, where is it?</i>

1155
01:34:33.982 --> 01:34:35.960
I saw the handoff.

1156
01:34:36.050 --> 01:34:39.063
You made me shoot her
for nothing.

1157
01:34:39.153 --> 01:34:43.234
You did get my pulse above 130,
no one's done that before.

1158
01:34:43.324 --> 01:34:44.960
Not even my wife.

1159
01:35:14.422 --> 01:35:17.291
You left Ives and his
team a hell of a cleanup.

1160
01:35:18.326 --> 01:35:21.138
Heat transfer was reversed.

1161
01:35:21.228 --> 01:35:23.040
You might be
the first case of hypothermia

1162
01:35:23.130 --> 01:35:25.243
from a gasoline explosion
in history.

1163
01:35:25.333 --> 01:35:28.269
At this point,
nothing surprises.

1164
01:35:29.804 --> 01:35:30.949
We're headed back to Oslo?

1165
01:35:31.039 --> 01:35:33.150
In a Rotas shipping container.

1166
01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:35.086
He's got the material, Neil.

1167
01:35:35.176 --> 01:35:37.188
I handed it to him on a plate.

1168
01:35:37.278 --> 01:35:38.789
I warned you...

1169
01:35:38.879 --> 01:35:40.024
What's happened's happened.

1170
01:35:40.114 --> 01:35:42.026
I get it now.

1171
01:35:42.116 --> 01:35:44.819
But it's hard to take things on trust
from people speaking half-truths.

1172
01:35:45.853 --> 01:35:47.098
That's not fair.

1173
01:35:47.188 --> 01:35:49.433
You were a part of this
before we met.

1174
01:35:49.523 --> 01:35:50.802
Were you working for Priya?

1175
01:35:50.892 --> 01:35:51.803
No.

1176
01:35:51.893 --> 01:35:53.604
Who recruited you, Neil?

1177
01:35:53.694 --> 01:35:56.674
It can't possibly do you any
good to know that right now.

1178
01:35:56.764 --> 01:36:01.679
When this is over, if we're still
standing, and you still care,

1179
01:36:01.769 --> 01:36:04.672
then you can hear
my life story, okay?

1180
01:36:06.942 --> 01:36:08.519
I'm sorry I involved you.

1181
01:36:08.609 --> 01:36:10.421
You need to tell me
what's going on.

1182
01:36:10.511 --> 01:36:13.324
Apparently Neil here knows
more about it than I do.

1183
01:36:13.414 --> 01:36:15.059
Good luck, pal.

1184
01:36:15.149 --> 01:36:17.461
By telling Kat anything,
we're compromising her in Priya's eyes.

1185
01:36:17.551 --> 01:36:20.164
In Priya's eyes,
she's already compromised.

1186
01:36:20.254 --> 01:36:22.600
She has the right to know
why she might die.

1187
01:36:22.690 --> 01:36:23.634
Am I gonna die?

1188
01:36:23.724 --> 01:36:25.536
Not if we have something
to say about it.

1189
01:36:25.626 --> 01:36:26.771
And we do.

1190
01:36:26.861 --> 01:36:29.073
Who are you?

1191
01:36:29.163 --> 01:36:33.167
Let's start with the simple stuff.
Every law of physics...

1192
01:36:38.974 --> 01:36:41.019
<i>The material's not in the case.</i>

1193
01:36:41.109 --> 01:36:44.645
<i>Get the other sections of the
algorithm to the hypocenter.</i>

1194
01:36:53.721 --> 01:36:54.755
You injured?

1195
01:37:00.394 --> 01:37:02.596
What's the algorithm, Neil?

1196
01:37:04.365 --> 01:37:07.635
241 is one section of it.
One out of nine.

1197
01:37:08.836 --> 01:37:11.148
It's a formula
rendered into physical form

1198
01:37:11.238 --> 01:37:13.751
so it can't be copied
or communicated.

1199
01:37:13.841 --> 01:37:15.810
It's a black box
with one function.

1200
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:18.623
Which is?

1201
01:37:18.713 --> 01:37:21.759
Inversion. But not objects
or peoples.

1202
01:37:21.849 --> 01:37:22.961
The world around us.

1203
01:37:23.051 --> 01:37:24.462
I don't understand.

1204
01:37:24.552 --> 01:37:27.131
As they invert the entropy
of more and more objects,

1205
01:37:27.221 --> 01:37:30.969
the two directions of time
are becoming more intertwined.

1206
01:37:31.059 --> 01:37:34.639
But because the environment
essentially flows in our direction...

1207
01:37:34.729 --> 01:37:35.673
we dominate.

1208
01:37:35.763 --> 01:37:37.375
They're always
swimming upstream.

1209
01:37:37.465 --> 01:37:38.910
It's what saved your life.

1210
01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.779
Inverted explosion was pushing
against the environment.

1211
01:37:41.869 --> 01:37:43.347
Pissing in the wind.

1212
01:37:43.437 --> 01:37:45.683
And the algorithm can
change the direction of that wind.

1213
01:37:45.773 --> 01:37:48.476
It can invert the entropy
of the world.

1214
01:37:49.144 --> 01:37:50.588
And if that happens?

1215
01:37:50.678 --> 01:37:51.712
Oh...

1216
01:37:52.279 --> 01:37:53.691
End of play.

1217
01:37:53.781 --> 01:37:55.894
"End of play." Can you be
a little more precise?

1218
01:37:55.984 --> 01:37:59.798
Everyone and everything that's ever
lived, destroyed. Instantly.

1219
01:37:59.888 --> 01:38:00.932
Precise enough?

1220
01:38:01.022 --> 01:38:02.723
Including my son.

1221
01:38:05.659 --> 01:38:08.930
The more you sleep,
the faster you'll heal.

1222
01:38:24.779 --> 01:38:26.014
On a truck.

1223
01:38:28.282 --> 01:38:29.717
Shouldn't be long now.

1224
01:38:30.785 --> 01:38:33.031
I've been thinking.

1225
01:38:33.121 --> 01:38:34.966
We're their ancestors.

1226
01:38:35.056 --> 01:38:37.869
If they destroy us,
won't that destroy them?

1227
01:38:37.959 --> 01:38:40.271
This brings us
to the grandfather paradox.

1228
01:38:40.361 --> 01:38:41.695
The what?

1229
01:38:42.429 --> 01:38:43.809
If you went back in time

1230
01:38:43.899 --> 01:38:45.476
and killed
your own grandfather,

1231
01:38:45.566 --> 01:38:47.478
how could you have been born
to commit the act?

1232
01:38:47.568 --> 01:38:48.746
What's the answer?

1233
01:38:48.836 --> 01:38:50.882
There's no answer.
It's a paradox.

1234
01:38:50.972 --> 01:38:52.084
But in the future,

1235
01:38:52.174 --> 01:38:53.751
those in power clearly believe
that you can

1236
01:38:53.841 --> 01:38:55.319
kick grandpa down the stairs,

1237
01:38:55.409 --> 01:38:57.155
gouge his eyes out,

1238
01:38:57.245 --> 01:38:58.422
slit his throat,

1239
01:38:58.512 --> 01:39:00.192
without consequence.

1240
01:39:00.282 --> 01:39:02.027
Could they be right?

1241
01:39:02.117 --> 01:39:03.728
Doesn't matter.

1242
01:39:03.818 --> 01:39:05.463
They believe it.

1243
01:39:05.553 --> 01:39:07.755
So they're willing
to destroy us.

1244
01:39:09.423 --> 01:39:11.136
Can I go back to sleep now?

1245
01:39:11.226 --> 01:39:12.670
No. I thought of
something else.

1246
01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:13.637
Great.

1247
01:39:13.727 --> 01:39:15.673
This reversing
the flow of time.

1248
01:39:15.763 --> 01:39:18.542
Doesn't us being here now
mean it never happens?

1249
01:39:18.632 --> 01:39:20.879
That we stop them?

1250
01:39:20.969 --> 01:39:23.305
Optimistically, I'd say
that's right.

1251
01:39:23.404 --> 01:39:24.950
Pessimistically?

1252
01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:27.451
In a parallel worlds theory,
we can't know the relationship

1253
01:39:27.541 --> 01:39:30.588
between consciousness
and multiple realities.

1254
01:39:30.678 --> 01:39:32.124
Does your head hurt yet?

1255
01:39:32.214 --> 01:39:33.547
Yes.

1256
01:39:37.285 --> 01:39:38.819
Try to sleep.

1257
01:39:53.667 --> 01:39:55.036
Shit.

1258
01:39:56.370 --> 01:39:58.539
They didn't take us inside.

1259
01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:01.442
What do we do?

1260
01:40:04.545 --> 01:40:05.824
We use the breach.

1261
01:40:05.914 --> 01:40:07.983
The chaos right after impact.
Get ready.

1262
01:40:10.952 --> 01:40:12.553
She healed enough?

1263
01:40:13.288 --> 01:40:15.100
I don't know.

1264
01:40:15.190 --> 01:40:16.534
I've never done this before.

1265
01:40:16.624 --> 01:40:19.271
The fire crew's there.

1266
01:40:19.361 --> 01:40:20.771
You take Kat
through the breach,

1267
01:40:20.861 --> 01:40:22.640
I take care of Sator's men
and secure the vault.

1268
01:40:22.730 --> 01:40:24.332
Then you bring her in.

1269
01:40:25.967 --> 01:40:27.012
How's your arm?

1270
01:40:27.102 --> 01:40:28.736
Not good.

1271
01:40:33.174 --> 01:40:35.043
We move as soon as
we hear the engines.

1272
01:40:39.546 --> 01:40:40.691
- Hold on, hold on.
- What?

1273
01:40:40.781 --> 01:40:42.626
You're bleeding.

1274
01:40:42.716 --> 01:40:44.085
All right, let me take
a look at it.

1275
01:40:50.691 --> 01:40:51.893
Ready?

1276
01:41:24.692 --> 01:41:26.227
Wait here. I'm going in.

1277
01:43:23.710 --> 01:43:25.056
Come on!

1278
01:43:25.146 --> 01:43:26.181
Go, go, go!

1279
01:43:56.444 --> 01:43:57.312
Go!

1280
01:45:39.547 --> 01:45:41.392
You knew it was me
coming out of that vault.

1281
01:45:41.482 --> 01:45:42.726
Why didn't you say?

1282
01:45:42.816 --> 01:45:44.362
That's a lot of explaining

1283
01:45:44.452 --> 01:45:45.830
when someone's about to put
a bullet in their own brain.

1284
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.165
But afterwards?

1285
01:45:47.255 --> 01:45:50.502
Thing's the same,
I knew you'd be okay.

1286
01:45:50.592 --> 01:45:52.103
What's happened's happened.

1287
01:45:52.193 --> 01:45:55.430
If I told you and you acted
differently, who knows?

1288
01:45:57.031 --> 01:45:59.577
The policy is to suppress.

1289
01:45:59.667 --> 01:46:01.479
Whose policy?

1290
01:46:01.569 --> 01:46:02.904
Ours, my friend.

1291
01:46:06.241 --> 01:46:09.344
We're the people saving the
world from what might've been.

1292
01:46:19.220 --> 01:46:20.288
Kat?

1293
01:46:21.256 --> 01:46:23.168
I'm here.

1294
01:46:23.258 --> 01:46:24.869
It'll be quite a scar.

1295
01:46:24.959 --> 01:46:26.327
You'll be okay.

1296
01:46:28.696 --> 01:46:29.941
Did it.

1297
01:46:30.031 --> 01:46:31.910
You did what?

1298
01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.901
Andrei has the algorithm.

1299
01:46:34.835 --> 01:46:36.837
You don't know where he is.

1300
01:46:38.772 --> 01:46:40.141
Or when.

1301
01:46:41.242 --> 01:46:43.521
- Get Priya here to Oslo.
- Why?

1302
01:46:43.611 --> 01:46:46.591
If I don't do something, in two
days, she tells me about the 241.

1303
01:46:46.681 --> 01:46:48.259
Nothing can change that.

1304
01:46:48.349 --> 01:46:49.350
We'll see.

1305
01:46:49.984 --> 01:46:51.452
Just get her here.

1306
01:46:53.955 --> 01:46:55.089
Hello, Priya.

1307
01:46:55.990 --> 01:46:57.435
What's going on?

1308
01:46:57.525 --> 01:46:59.037
Where's Neil?

1309
01:46:59.127 --> 01:47:02.640
Nursing Katherine Barton,
who almost died because of you.

1310
01:47:02.730 --> 01:47:03.707
What did I do?

1311
01:47:03.797 --> 01:47:05.310
It's what you're going to do.

1312
01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:07.545
In two days, you're gonna have
me dangle plutonium-241

1313
01:47:07.635 --> 01:47:10.081
in front of the world's
most dangerous arms dealer.

1314
01:47:10.171 --> 01:47:11.883
Now, I wanna know why.

1315
01:47:11.973 --> 01:47:14.085
You let Sator get hold of 241?

1316
01:47:14.175 --> 01:47:16.177
No, I let him get ahold
of the algorithm.

1317
01:47:17.679 --> 01:47:19.991
So, tell me about it, Priya.

1318
01:47:20.081 --> 01:47:22.493
It's... It's unique.

1319
01:47:22.583 --> 01:47:24.429
The scientist who built it
took her own life

1320
01:47:24.519 --> 01:47:26.130
so she couldn't be forced
to make another.

1321
01:47:26.220 --> 01:47:27.398
A scientist in the future?

1322
01:47:27.488 --> 01:47:28.466
Generations from now.

1323
01:47:28.556 --> 01:47:30.301
Why does she have to
kill herself?

1324
01:47:30.391 --> 01:47:33.304
You're familiar
with the Manhattan Project?

1325
01:47:33.394 --> 01:47:35.473
As they approached
the first atomic test,

1326
01:47:35.563 --> 01:47:37.041
Oppenheimer became concerned

1327
01:47:37.131 --> 01:47:39.844
that the detonation
might produce a chain reaction,

1328
01:47:39.934 --> 01:47:41.145
engulfing the world.

1329
01:47:41.235 --> 01:47:42.746
They went ahead anyway
and got lucky.

1330
01:47:42.836 --> 01:47:47.418
Think of our scientist as
her generation's Oppenheimer.

1331
01:47:47.508 --> 01:47:50.021
She devises a method
for inverting the world,

1332
01:47:50.111 --> 01:47:52.824
but becomes convinced
that by destroying us,

1333
01:47:52.914 --> 01:47:54.525
they're destroying themselves.

1334
01:47:54.615 --> 01:47:56.461
The grandfather paradox.

1335
01:47:56.551 --> 01:47:58.429
But, unlike Oppenheimer,

1336
01:47:58.519 --> 01:47:59.631
she rebels,

1337
01:47:59.721 --> 01:48:01.933
splitting the algorithm
into nine sections

1338
01:48:02.023 --> 01:48:04.559
and hiding them the best place
she can think of.

1339
01:48:05.226 --> 01:48:06.271
The past.

1340
01:48:06.361 --> 01:48:07.238
Here, now.

1341
01:48:07.328 --> 01:48:09.741
There are nine nuclear powers.

1342
01:48:09.831 --> 01:48:11.775
Nine bombs.

1343
01:48:11.865 --> 01:48:14.812
Nine sets of the most closely guarded
materials in the history of the world.

1344
01:48:14.902 --> 01:48:16.914
The best hiding place possible.

1345
01:48:17.004 --> 01:48:19.783
Nuclear containment facilities.

1346
01:48:19.873 --> 01:48:21.252
Sator's lifelong mission,

1347
01:48:21.342 --> 01:48:23.955
financed and guided
by the future, has been to

1348
01:48:24.045 --> 01:48:26.457
find and reassemble
the algorithm.

1349
01:48:26.547 --> 01:48:27.759
Why do they choose him?

1350
01:48:27.849 --> 01:48:29.761
Because he was at the right
place at the right time.

1351
01:48:29.851 --> 01:48:31.829
The collapse of
the Soviet Union.

1352
01:48:31.919 --> 01:48:35.233
The most insecure moment in the
history of nuclear weapons.

1353
01:48:35.323 --> 01:48:37.702
How many sections does he have?

1354
01:48:37.792 --> 01:48:39.504
After the 241, all nine.

1355
01:48:39.594 --> 01:48:41.372
Jesus Christ.

1356
01:48:41.462 --> 01:48:44.632
And that's why you're going to
do things differently this time.

1357
01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.978
To change things?

1358
01:48:47.068 --> 01:48:48.313
So Katherine won't get hurt?

1359
01:48:48.403 --> 01:48:50.905
So Sator won't get
the algorithm.

1360
01:48:52.774 --> 01:48:55.119
If that universe can exist...

1361
01:48:55.209 --> 01:48:56.454
we don't live in it.

1362
01:48:56.544 --> 01:48:58.456
Well, let's try.

1363
01:48:58.546 --> 01:49:00.358
You're going to warn me.

1364
01:49:00.448 --> 01:49:02.026
No, I'm not.

1365
01:49:02.116 --> 01:49:03.661
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1366
01:49:03.751 --> 01:49:04.962
Come on.

1367
01:49:05.052 --> 01:49:07.165
If you had known
what the algorithm was,

1368
01:49:07.255 --> 01:49:09.557
would you have let it fall
into Sator's hands?

1369
01:49:10.691 --> 01:49:12.637
You want Sator to get
the last section.

1370
01:49:12.727 --> 01:49:15.373
That is the only way he'll
bring together the other eight.

1371
01:49:15.463 --> 01:49:17.675
I was supposed to steal it...

1372
01:49:17.765 --> 01:49:18.876
then lose it?

1373
01:49:18.966 --> 01:49:20.813
Mission accomplished.

1374
01:49:20.903 --> 01:49:22.437
You used me.

1375
01:49:23.271 --> 01:49:25.416
As you used Katherine.

1376
01:49:25.506 --> 01:49:27.742
Standard operating procedure.

1377
01:49:28.911 --> 01:49:30.311
You've done your part.

1378
01:49:30.878 --> 01:49:32.123
My part?

1379
01:49:32.213 --> 01:49:34.759
I'm the protagonist
of this operation.

1380
01:49:34.849 --> 01:49:35.993
You...

1381
01:49:36.083 --> 01:49:37.862
are a protagonist.

1382
01:49:37.952 --> 01:49:40.923
Did you think you were the only
one capable of saving the world?

1383
01:49:45.760 --> 01:49:46.961
No.

1384
01:49:48.062 --> 01:49:49.640
But I am.

1385
01:49:49.730 --> 01:49:51.008
Because I haven't told you

1386
01:49:51.098 --> 01:49:52.877
where he's assembling the
algorithm or when.

1387
01:49:52.967 --> 01:49:54.078
You're about to.

1388
01:49:54.168 --> 01:49:55.747
No, I'm not.

1389
01:49:55.837 --> 01:49:57.104
So, deal us in.

1390
01:49:58.105 --> 01:49:59.450
"Us"?

1391
01:49:59.540 --> 01:50:01.085
Why would you want to
involve her again?

1392
01:50:01.175 --> 01:50:02.653
Because she can get
close to him.

1393
01:50:02.743 --> 01:50:04.021
Does he still trust her?

1394
01:50:04.111 --> 01:50:05.490
He thinks she's dead.

1395
01:50:05.580 --> 01:50:06.859
But he used to.

1396
01:50:06.949 --> 01:50:09.127
You have started looking at
the world in a new way.

1397
01:50:09.217 --> 01:50:10.561
And now, it's your turn.

1398
01:50:10.651 --> 01:50:12.296
Assuming she
makes it out alive,

1399
01:50:12.386 --> 01:50:14.599
whether or not you feel
she knows too much.

1400
01:50:14.689 --> 01:50:15.767
I can't.

1401
01:50:15.857 --> 01:50:17.168
If you don't have
the authority,

1402
01:50:17.258 --> 01:50:19.604
then talk to whoever's
in charge of loose ends.

1403
01:50:19.694 --> 01:50:21.339
I need your word

1404
01:50:21.429 --> 01:50:24.375
that she and her son
will be safe, Priya.

1405
01:50:24.465 --> 01:50:26.434
What good is someone's word
in our line of business?

1406
01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:33.407
They'll be safe.

1407
01:50:35.309 --> 01:50:37.422
There's a rally point
offshore at Trondheim.

1408
01:50:37.512 --> 01:50:39.123
<i>Get yourselves up there.</i>

1409
01:50:39.213 --> 01:50:41.092
<i>Ives has a team
ready to invert.</i>

1410
01:50:41.182 --> 01:50:42.627
<i>You have
a turnstile?</i>

1411
01:50:42.717 --> 01:50:45.229
The exact technology
that we're trying to suppress.

1412
01:50:45.319 --> 01:50:47.999
Fighting fire with fire's
a treacherous business.

1413
01:50:48.089 --> 01:50:50.168
But there are some people,
in the future,

1414
01:50:50.258 --> 01:50:53.761
who want to continue the
algorithm's journey into the past.

1415
01:50:54.829 --> 01:50:56.340
You see...

1416
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:59.310
<i>Tenet wasn't founded
in the past.</i>

1417
01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:02.603
<i>It will be founded
in the future.</i>

1418
01:51:28.931 --> 01:51:30.843
Can't get over the birds.

1419
01:51:30.933 --> 01:51:32.733
How're you feeling?

1420
01:51:38.006 --> 01:51:39.640
Tell me you're gonna kill him.

1421
01:51:40.441 --> 01:51:41.352
I can't.

1422
01:51:41.442 --> 01:51:42.587
Why not?

1423
01:51:42.677 --> 01:51:44.355
Bet you've probably
killed a lot of people.

1424
01:51:44.445 --> 01:51:46.524
Not with a dead man's switch.

1425
01:51:46.614 --> 01:51:48.861
The fitness tracker he wears.

1426
01:51:48.951 --> 01:51:50.127
He's obsessive
about his health.

1427
01:51:50.217 --> 01:51:51.395
It'll be linked
to a switch,

1428
01:51:51.485 --> 01:51:53.564
probably a simple e-mail burst

1429
01:51:53.654 --> 01:51:55.399
that reveals the location
of the dead drop,

1430
01:51:55.489 --> 01:51:57.401
set to fire if his heart stops.

1431
01:51:57.491 --> 01:51:59.872
His death activates
the algorithm.

1432
01:51:59.962 --> 01:52:01.739
He dies, the world ends.

1433
01:52:01.829 --> 01:52:03.497
No one dares kill him.

1434
01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:07.735
No, you've missed the point.

1435
01:52:10.005 --> 01:52:11.539
He's intending to end his life.

1436
01:52:13.909 --> 01:52:14.775
Why?

1437
01:52:16.611 --> 01:52:18.145
He's dying.

1438
01:52:18.981 --> 01:52:21.215
Inoperable pancreatic cancer.

1439
01:52:22.516 --> 01:52:24.495
And he's taking the world
with him.

1440
01:52:24.585 --> 01:52:26.798
If he can't have her,
no one can.

1441
01:52:26.888 --> 01:52:31.068
He gets to choose the time and
place for the end of the world.

1442
01:52:31.158 --> 01:52:33.694
What moment?
What does he choose?

1443
01:52:35.529 --> 01:52:38.499
You told me about a holiday
where you let him feel loved.

1444
01:52:38.900 --> 01:52:40.111
Vietnam.

1445
01:52:40.201 --> 01:52:42.146
You said he vanished. What day?

1446
01:52:42.236 --> 01:52:44.582
I went ashore with Max and he flew
off, but I don't know what day it was.

1447
01:52:44.672 --> 01:52:46.985
It was the 14th. Ten days ago.

1448
01:52:47.075 --> 01:52:48.352
He was in Ukraine.

1449
01:52:48.442 --> 01:52:50.087
At the Kiev opera siege.

1450
01:52:50.177 --> 01:52:53.624
How do you know about that?

1451
01:52:53.714 --> 01:52:55.928
The point is, he wasn't on his
yacht, so that's his window.

1452
01:52:56.018 --> 01:52:58.596
To go back to that golden
moment and have it be his last.

1453
01:52:58.686 --> 01:53:00.298
Everyone's last.

1454
01:53:00.388 --> 01:53:02.133
We have to lift the algorithm
from the dead drop

1455
01:53:02.223 --> 01:53:03.501
without Sator knowing.

1456
01:53:03.591 --> 01:53:05.804
If he believes it's there,
he kills himself.

1457
01:53:05.894 --> 01:53:07.305
And not the rest of us.

1458
01:53:07.395 --> 01:53:08.506
Where's the dead drop?

1459
01:53:08.596 --> 01:53:10.274
Knowledge divided, my friend.

1460
01:53:10.364 --> 01:53:11.409
You're not gonna tell me?

1461
01:53:11.499 --> 01:53:12.878
Ignorance is our ammunition.

1462
01:53:12.968 --> 01:53:14.880
But I need you back
on that yacht, Kat.

1463
01:53:14.970 --> 01:53:16.781
Why?

1464
01:53:16.871 --> 01:53:19.216
You have to stop him killing
himself until we know the algorithm

1465
01:53:19.306 --> 01:53:21.218
is out of the dead drop.

1466
01:53:21.308 --> 01:53:23.354
But if I'm caught there,
my son sees.

1467
01:53:23.444 --> 01:53:25.156
I don't want those moments
to be full of anguish

1468
01:53:25.246 --> 01:53:27.448
if they're gonna be his last.

1469
01:53:28.116 --> 01:53:29.383
They're not.

1470
01:53:54.308 --> 01:53:55.519
It's time.

1471
01:53:55.609 --> 01:53:56.955
We're working our way
back to the 14th,

1472
01:53:57.045 --> 01:53:58.689
but without knowing
where the dead drop is,

1473
01:53:58.779 --> 01:54:01.348
there's only so much
I can do to prepare.

1474
01:54:02.416 --> 01:54:05.496
You know what a hypocenter is?

1475
01:54:05.586 --> 01:54:07.899
It's ground zero for
an underground nuclear test.

1476
01:54:07.989 --> 01:54:13.071
Sir Michael Crosby told me about a
detonation in Stalsk-12 on the 14th.

1477
01:54:13.161 --> 01:54:15.473
The dead drop is at the bottom
of the hypocenter.

1478
01:54:15.563 --> 01:54:18.542
That explosion
seals up the algorithm.

1479
01:54:18.632 --> 01:54:20.311
Well, then we better
pull it out of that hole

1480
01:54:20.401 --> 01:54:22.603
before the bomb goes off, eh?

1481
01:54:24.739 --> 01:54:26.484
<i>Line it up.</i>

1482
01:54:26.574 --> 01:54:27.775
<i>Move forward.</i>

1483
01:54:29.877 --> 01:54:30.878
<i>Next.</i>

1484
01:54:35.117 --> 01:54:36.317
<i>Line it up.</i>

1485
01:54:37.953 --> 01:54:39.286
Where's Neil?

1486
01:54:42.224 --> 01:54:43.434
He must've
gone through already.

1487
01:54:43.524 --> 01:54:45.269
I didn't get to say goodbye.

1488
01:54:45.359 --> 01:54:46.972
This is goodbye, isn't it?

1489
01:54:47.062 --> 01:54:48.673
I'd like to say...

1490
01:54:48.763 --> 01:54:50.574
that you don't have to
do this, Kat...

1491
01:54:50.664 --> 01:54:53.744
Worst thing Andrei ever did to
me was that offer he made me.

1492
01:54:53.834 --> 01:54:57.038
Let me go if I agreed
never to see my son again.

1493
01:54:58.305 --> 01:55:00.284
I shouted and...

1494
01:55:00.374 --> 01:55:02.453
<i>swore.</i>

1495
01:55:02.543 --> 01:55:04.946
But he'd seen it on my face,
just for an instant.

1496
01:55:08.282 --> 01:55:10.461
I considered it.

1497
01:55:10.551 --> 01:55:12.763
I don't know if I hate him more
for what he's done,

1498
01:55:12.853 --> 01:55:14.923
or because he knows that
about me.

1499
01:55:15.322 --> 01:55:16.524
Oh.

1500
01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:19.704
A chance to help save my child.

1501
01:55:19.794 --> 01:55:21.973
You can't know
what that means to a mother.

1502
01:55:22.063 --> 01:55:23.340
No.

1503
01:55:23.430 --> 01:55:25.276
You've killed people
you've hated before.

1504
01:55:25.366 --> 01:55:26.777
It's not usually personal.

1505
01:55:26.867 --> 01:55:28.847
Well, he's dying anyway.
Maybe it doesn't even count.

1506
01:55:28.937 --> 01:55:30.715
It always counts, Kat.

1507
01:55:30.805 --> 01:55:34.251
You're not there to kill him,
you're the backstop.

1508
01:55:34.341 --> 01:55:37.189
If we don't lift that algorithm
and he kills himself,

1509
01:55:37.279 --> 01:55:38.980
he takes us all with him.

1510
01:55:41.549 --> 01:55:43.818
You just keep up
your end, okay?

1511
01:55:47.755 --> 01:55:49.266
Today's the 14th.

1512
01:55:49.356 --> 01:55:50.936
Offshore of Siberia.

1513
01:55:51.026 --> 01:55:52.336
Time for us to go.

1514
01:55:52.426 --> 01:55:53.704
You keep going back
another day,

1515
01:55:53.794 --> 01:55:55.606
give you some time
to get back into Vietnam.

1516
01:55:55.696 --> 01:55:56.774
And who gets me on the yacht?

1517
01:55:56.864 --> 01:55:58.642
I've got somebody good
lined up.

1518
01:55:58.732 --> 01:56:01.679
When it's over, when you're
raising your boy, carry this.

1519
01:56:01.769 --> 01:56:04.082
There may be a time and place
you feel threatened.

1520
01:56:04.172 --> 01:56:07.384
Hit "talk," state your
location, hang up.

1521
01:56:07.474 --> 01:56:09.420
Who gets the message?

1522
01:56:09.510 --> 01:56:11.412
Posterity.

1523
01:56:50.551 --> 01:56:52.130
Stalsk-12.

1524
01:56:52.220 --> 01:56:55.299
Hidden from the world is a city
where anything can happen.

1525
01:56:55.389 --> 01:56:59.770
And today, ladies and gents,
for ten minutes, it most assuredly does.

1526
01:56:59.860 --> 01:57:03.574
You've been divided into two teams
for a temporal pincer movement.

1527
01:57:03.664 --> 01:57:05.177
We're Red Team, moving forward.

1528
01:57:05.267 --> 01:57:07.678
In order to distinguish
the teams, you'll wear these.

1529
01:57:07.768 --> 01:57:09.214
Our friends over there,

1530
01:57:09.304 --> 01:57:11.582
Blue Team, led by Commander
Wheeler, are inverted.

1531
01:57:11.672 --> 01:57:13.784
Why don't they let us see them?

1532
01:57:13.874 --> 01:57:15.253
Maybe we won't like
what happened.

1533
01:57:15.343 --> 01:57:18.346
One hour from now,
they had this briefing.

1534
01:57:20.115 --> 01:57:23.561
Then, were dropped on the ridge
above the hypocenter,

1535
01:57:23.651 --> 01:57:25.864
as close in time
to the detonation as possible.

1536
01:57:25.954 --> 01:57:29.868
Their objectives were clearance
and clarification.

1537
01:57:29.958 --> 01:57:33.962
Now, this briefing has the
benefit of their experience.

1538
01:57:50.711 --> 01:57:52.623
Both teams have
countdown watches.

1539
01:57:52.713 --> 01:57:55.260
Ours counts down from ten,
from landing

1540
01:57:55.350 --> 01:57:57.162
to zero to the explosion.

1541
01:57:57.252 --> 01:57:58.897
- <i>Blue Team is reversed.</i>
- Everybody, look to your left.

1542
01:57:58.987 --> 01:58:03.024
If you are not at the LZ
at zero, you are not leaving.

1543
01:58:04.092 --> 01:58:05.337
Do you understand?

1544
01:58:05.427 --> 01:58:09.007
We drop in, clear LZs
for Blue Team evacuation.

1545
01:58:09.097 --> 01:58:10.809
We make our way
into the city proper.

1546
01:58:10.899 --> 01:58:13.510
These buildings are abandoned,
but we learned

1547
01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:15.213
there is a turnstile.

1548
01:58:15.303 --> 01:58:17.282
Expect a bitemporal response.

1549
01:58:17.372 --> 01:58:18.749
They'll have inverse ordnance?

1550
01:58:18.839 --> 01:58:21.086
Inverse, conventional,

1551
01:58:21.176 --> 01:58:24.455
forward antagonists, inverted
antagonists, they have it all.

1552
01:58:24.545 --> 01:58:26.024
On the other side of the city,

1553
01:58:26.114 --> 01:58:28.360
the ground rises to the ridge
above the hypocenter.

1554
01:58:28.450 --> 01:58:31.863
A splinter unit will take this
tunnel from the city

1555
01:58:31.953 --> 01:58:33.865
to the floor of the hypocenter.

1556
01:58:33.955 --> 01:58:36.634
Blue Team located
an entrance here.

1557
01:58:36.724 --> 01:58:38.803
The bomb is in this rock,

1558
01:58:38.893 --> 01:58:42.007
high above,
to trigger a collapse,

1559
01:58:42.097 --> 01:58:42.974
sealing the cavern.

1560
01:58:43.064 --> 01:58:44.675
How do we defuse the bomb
up there?

1561
01:58:44.765 --> 01:58:47.212
We don't. The explosion
takes place as planned.

1562
01:58:47.302 --> 01:58:51.216
Now, our job is to fail
to defuse that bomb

1563
01:58:51.306 --> 01:58:55.020
while the splinter unit
achieves its task undetected.

1564
01:58:55.110 --> 01:58:55.887
Which is?

1565
01:58:55.977 --> 01:58:58.156
Need-to-know, and you don't.

1566
01:58:58.246 --> 01:58:59.991
Any other stupid questions?

1567
01:59:00.081 --> 01:59:02.716
Good. Well, let's go.
Let's get ready.

1568
01:59:05.453 --> 01:59:06.831
I wanted to be
on the first wave.

1569
01:59:06.921 --> 01:59:08.300
There is no first wave.

1570
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:11.169
Red Team and Blue Team
operate simultaneously.

1571
01:59:11.259 --> 01:59:12.971
Look,

1572
01:59:13.061 --> 01:59:15.173
don't get on the chopper if you
can't stop thinking in linear terms.

1573
01:59:15.263 --> 01:59:18.575
Now, you wanna be on the team that
lifts the contents of the capsule?

1574
01:59:18.665 --> 01:59:20.678
Absolutely.

1575
01:59:20.768 --> 01:59:22.814
Yeah, that's us.

1576
01:59:22.904 --> 01:59:24.349
We're splinter unit.

1577
01:59:24.439 --> 01:59:26.184
Just us?

1578
01:59:26.274 --> 01:59:29.888
No one who knows the contents of
that capsule can leave the field.

1579
01:59:29.978 --> 01:59:32.746
I thought we'd
manage ourselves.

1580
01:59:42.257 --> 01:59:44.369
It's 40 feet from the
private deck to the water.

1581
01:59:44.459 --> 01:59:46.004
Can you jump it?

1582
01:59:46.094 --> 01:59:47.339
I can dive it.

1583
01:59:47.429 --> 01:59:50.131
Until you see my signal,
you don't let him die.

1584
02:00:25.900 --> 02:00:27.402
Thirty seconds!

1585
02:01:08.476 --> 02:01:09.676
Go! Go! Go!

1586
02:01:21.156 --> 02:01:23.234
We're coming in
on a shockwave.

1587
02:01:23.324 --> 02:01:24.658
Hang on, people.

1588
02:01:33.601 --> 02:01:35.036
On your feet!

1589
02:01:48.616 --> 02:01:50.118
There!

1590
02:02:03.097 --> 02:02:04.775
Ma'am.
We thought you'd gone ashore.

1591
02:02:04.865 --> 02:02:06.478
Well, I snuck back
to surprise Andrei.

1592
02:02:06.568 --> 02:02:07.502
Oh, the boss left.

1593
02:02:08.970 --> 02:02:11.316
Well, have Mr. Sator
find me here.

1594
02:02:11.406 --> 02:02:12.716
And don't tell the others.

1595
02:02:12.806 --> 02:02:14.175
I'll get the mess.

1596
02:03:21.676 --> 02:03:22.753
Mines!

1597
02:03:22.843 --> 02:03:24.012
Mines!

1598
02:03:38.092 --> 02:03:39.427
They told me
you'd gone ashore.

1599
02:03:41.795 --> 02:03:42.941
They told me you'd flown off.

1600
02:03:43.031 --> 02:03:45.176
I came back to see you and Max.

1601
02:03:45.266 --> 02:03:48.446
Max is on shore with Anna.

1602
02:03:48.536 --> 02:03:50.248
We need time, just you and me,
after what happened.

1603
02:03:50.338 --> 02:03:53.318
I was joking.
It was a stupid joke.

1604
02:03:53.408 --> 02:03:55.186
You think I'm
a terrible mother.

1605
02:03:55.276 --> 02:03:58.845
We both know my opinion of you
is higher than yours of me.

1606
02:04:06.387 --> 02:04:09.057
I want things
to be better, Andrei.

1607
02:04:24.572 --> 02:04:25.907
Take cover!

1608
02:04:30.011 --> 02:04:31.889
Get me a goddamn AT4!

1609
02:04:31.979 --> 02:04:33.757
Take him out, now!

1610
02:04:33.847 --> 02:04:35.226
Provide some cover!

1611
02:04:35.316 --> 02:04:37.428
Move, move, move! Let's go!

1612
02:04:37.518 --> 02:04:38.953
Move, move, move!

1613
02:05:49.056 --> 02:05:50.124
Wheeler!

1614
02:05:51.692 --> 02:05:52.737
Get outta there!

1615
02:05:52.827 --> 02:05:54.162
Come on!

1616
02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:00.568
Ives!

1617
02:06:02.770 --> 02:06:04.472
Splinter unit. Here.

1618
02:06:06.107 --> 02:06:08.086
You know, it's going to be
a beautiful sunset.

1619
02:06:08.176 --> 02:06:12.924
I'll get Max brought back.
We should share the moment with him.

1620
02:06:13.014 --> 02:06:15.893
I'll make you a drink.

1621
02:06:15.983 --> 02:06:18.186
Bring my son back to the boat.

1622
02:06:24.392 --> 02:06:25.636
We're runnin' out of time,
let's go!

1623
02:06:25.726 --> 02:06:28.129
If they see us,
it's all for nothing.

1624
02:06:31.766 --> 02:06:32.910
We need a distraction.

1625
02:06:33.000 --> 02:06:34.635
Don't worry about that.

1626
02:06:38.172 --> 02:06:39.707
On my mark!

1627
02:06:42.577 --> 02:06:45.022
RPG, hit the base!

1628
02:06:45.112 --> 02:06:46.314
That building
on my mark!

1629
02:06:48.449 --> 02:06:50.128
Three! Two!

1630
02:06:50.218 --> 02:06:52.220
One! Fire!

1631
02:06:53.120 --> 02:06:54.455
Fire!

1632
02:07:09.237 --> 02:07:10.705
Move! Move!

1633
02:07:26.287 --> 02:07:28.489
We're committed now. Come on.

1634
02:07:34.729 --> 02:07:36.240
What's that?

1635
02:07:36.330 --> 02:07:39.100
I borrowed it
from the CIA.

1636
02:07:40.167 --> 02:07:41.245
What is it?

1637
02:07:41.335 --> 02:07:43.781
The way the world ends.

1638
02:07:43.871 --> 02:07:46.684
Not with a bang, but a whimper.

1639
02:07:46.774 --> 02:07:48.386
I don't understand.

1640
02:07:48.476 --> 02:07:50.611
When I take this,
it's all over.

1641
02:07:51.345 --> 02:07:53.447
Then don't take it yet.

1642
02:07:56.484 --> 02:07:58.185
Why not?

1643
02:07:59.453 --> 02:08:01.867
Because we have
the sunset coming.

1644
02:08:01.957 --> 02:08:04.368
And a little vodka left.

1645
02:08:04.458 --> 02:08:06.471
And Max will be here soon.

1646
02:08:06.561 --> 02:08:10.765
They said they thought it was
you, not Anna, ashore with Max.

1647
02:08:13.434 --> 02:08:17.171
So long as you can tell
the difference.

1648
02:08:19.106 --> 02:08:21.809
A moment's business, my love.

1649
02:08:33.989 --> 02:08:35.266
<i>Mahir, do you copy?</i>

1650
02:08:35.356 --> 02:08:38.636
<i>Not clear. I repeat, not clear!</i>

1651
02:08:38.726 --> 02:08:39.838
Copy that.

1652
02:08:39.928 --> 02:08:43.230
I repeat, not clear!

1653
02:09:09.657 --> 02:09:10.725
Neil!

1654
02:09:11.559 --> 02:09:12.627
Neil!

1655
02:09:25.539 --> 02:09:26.641
Go!

1656
02:09:35.383 --> 02:09:38.319
We don't have anything
big enough to blow this.

1657
02:09:44.358 --> 02:09:46.293
Try him.
See if he's got a grenade.

1658
02:09:50.899 --> 02:09:51.944
Anything?

1659
02:09:52.034 --> 02:09:53.444
Nah, nothing.

1660
02:09:53.534 --> 02:09:55.881
Here, you try having
a look. Can you pick it?

1661
02:09:55.971 --> 02:09:57.181
<i>I hope not.</i>

1662
02:09:57.271 --> 02:09:59.051
<i>I paid a lot for that lock.</i>

1663
02:09:59.141 --> 02:10:02.119
<i>How do you like where my
journey began and yours ends?</i>

1664
02:10:02.209 --> 02:10:03.654
Little radioactive
for my taste.

1665
02:10:03.744 --> 02:10:07.758
My fate was always bound up
with radiation.

1666
02:10:07.848 --> 02:10:10.595
We'd work where
no one else would.

1667
02:10:10.685 --> 02:10:13.297
I made a bargain
with the devil.

1668
02:10:13.387 --> 02:10:15.099
Money for time.

1669
02:10:15.189 --> 02:10:17.069
We sold our futures.

1670
02:10:17.159 --> 02:10:20.304
And now you're about to make the
same mistake for the entire world.

1671
02:10:20.394 --> 02:10:23.674
<i>It wasn't a mistake.
I made the bargain I could.</i>

1672
02:10:23.764 --> 02:10:25.077
<i>What was yours?</i>

1673
02:10:25.167 --> 02:10:27.980
<i>You fight for a cause
you barely understand...</i>

1674
02:10:28.070 --> 02:10:31.716
<i>with people you trust so little,
you've told them nothing.</i>

1675
02:10:31.806 --> 02:10:34.142
<i>When I die,
the world dies with me.</i>

1676
02:10:34.241 --> 02:10:36.120
And your knowledge
dies with you,

1677
02:10:36.210 --> 02:10:39.858
<i>buried in a tomb like an
anonymous Egyptian builder</i>

1678
02:10:39.948 --> 02:10:42.526
<i>sealed in a pyramid
to keep his secret.</i>

1679
02:10:42.616 --> 02:10:45.352
Your faith is blind.
You're a fanatic.

1680
02:11:05.539 --> 02:11:08.319
<i>What's more fanatical
than trying to destroy the world?</i>

1681
02:11:08.409 --> 02:11:11.123
I'm not,
I'm creating a new one.

1682
02:11:11.213 --> 02:11:15.660
Somewhere, sometime, a man in a
crystalline tower throws a switch

1683
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:19.463
and Armageddon
is both triggered and avoided.

1684
02:11:19.553 --> 02:11:23.101
Now time itself
switches direction.

1685
02:11:23.191 --> 02:11:25.302
<i>The same sunshine we basked in</i>

1686
02:11:25.392 --> 02:11:29.507
<i>will warm the faces of our
descendants generations to come.</i>

1687
02:11:29.597 --> 02:11:31.575
How could they wanna kill us?

1688
02:11:31.665 --> 02:11:34.846
Because their oceans rose
and their rivers ran dry.

1689
02:11:34.936 --> 02:11:39.216
<i>Don't you see?
They have no choice but to turn back.</i>

1690
02:11:39.306 --> 02:11:41.475
We're responsible.

1691
02:11:54.722 --> 02:11:57.525
Knowing this,
do you still want me to stop?

1692
02:11:58.759 --> 02:12:00.072
Yes.

1693
02:12:00.162 --> 02:12:02.440
Each generation
looks out for its own survival.

1694
02:12:02.530 --> 02:12:04.442
That's exactly
what they're doing.

1695
02:12:04.532 --> 02:12:06.711
<i>But not you. You're a traitor.</i>

1696
02:12:06.801 --> 02:12:08.312
Bringing death to all,
because you have no life

1697
02:12:08.402 --> 02:12:09.981
of your own left.

1698
02:12:10.071 --> 02:12:11.883
<i>When I'm done, life continues.</i>

1699
02:12:11.973 --> 02:12:13.617
<i>Not your son's.</i>

1700
02:12:13.707 --> 02:12:17.321
My greatest sin was to bring a son
into a world I knew was ending.

1701
02:12:17.411 --> 02:12:19.446
<i>You think God will forgive me?</i>

1702
02:12:25.120 --> 02:12:26.420
Wait!

1703
02:12:27.222 --> 02:12:28.422
Wait!

1704
02:12:29.257 --> 02:12:30.758
God...

1705
02:12:42.003 --> 02:12:43.637
Cover me!

1706
02:12:51.345 --> 02:12:53.414
Go! Go! Go!

1707
02:12:54.882 --> 02:12:57.561
You don't believe
in God, or a future,

1708
02:12:57.651 --> 02:12:59.730
or anything outside
of your own experience.

1709
02:12:59.820 --> 02:13:02.901
<i>The rest is belief.</i>

1710
02:13:02.991 --> 02:13:05.369
And I don't have it.

1711
02:13:05.459 --> 02:13:07.438
Without it, you're not human.

1712
02:13:07.528 --> 02:13:09.064
You're just a madman.

1713
02:13:09.763 --> 02:13:11.810
Or a god.

1714
02:13:11.900 --> 02:13:12.811
<i>Of sorts.</i>

1715
02:13:12.901 --> 02:13:13.935
Like I said.

1716
02:13:17.138 --> 02:13:19.151
Don't. Jesus.

1717
02:13:19.241 --> 02:13:20.674
Our time is up.

1718
02:13:27.215 --> 02:13:29.627
I'll give your love to my wife.

1719
02:13:29.717 --> 02:13:32.164
You're forgetting.
I haven't met her yet.

1720
02:13:32.254 --> 02:13:33.265
<i>That's right.</i>

1721
02:13:33.355 --> 02:13:34.900
After you meet her, she dies.

1722
02:13:34.990 --> 02:13:37.758
<i>I'll just give her
my love instead.</i>

1723
02:13:38.994 --> 02:13:39.895
Don't do...

1724
02:13:41.363 --> 02:13:42.623
Volkov...

1725
02:13:42.700 --> 02:13:44.430
Shoot him in the head.

1726
02:13:56.111 --> 02:13:58.146
Enough business,
my love.

1727
02:14:25.106 --> 02:14:28.009
You have no idea
what I'm talking about, do you?

1728
02:14:29.978 --> 02:14:32.846
But it sounds
terribly important.

1729
02:14:34.748 --> 02:14:36.194
Where are you going?

1730
02:14:36.284 --> 02:14:37.484
Aren't you hot?

1731
02:14:54.269 --> 02:14:55.613
What are you doing now?

1732
02:14:55.703 --> 02:14:57.548
I spilled sunscreen.

1733
02:14:57.638 --> 02:14:59.707
- So what?
- Slippery!

1734
02:15:02.776 --> 02:15:04.511
Just come here.

1735
02:15:07.514 --> 02:15:08.927
Turn over.

1736
02:15:09.017 --> 02:15:10.517
You'll like it.

1737
02:15:44.752 --> 02:15:47.065
I can't do this.

1738
02:15:47.155 --> 02:15:49.433
- I can't let you think you've won.
- Don't spoil this moment, Kat.

1739
02:15:49.523 --> 02:15:52.559
I'm not letting you go to your grave
thinking we're coming with you.

1740
02:15:55.030 --> 02:15:56.573
You're dying alone, Andrei.

1741
02:15:56.663 --> 02:15:57.909
Come on, come on,
come on!

1742
02:15:57.999 --> 02:16:00.678
Tunnel's sealed,
gate's closed.

1743
02:16:00.768 --> 02:16:02.847
Mahir, do you copy?

1744
02:16:02.937 --> 02:16:03.747
Yeah.

1745
02:16:03.837 --> 02:16:05.806
<i>Hold. I repeat, hold!</i>

1746
02:16:11.079 --> 02:16:12.113
Look in my eyes.

1747
02:16:13.547 --> 02:16:15.116
Which do you see?

1748
02:16:16.217 --> 02:16:19.154
Despair or anger?

1749
02:16:20.422 --> 02:16:22.566
I'm not the woman
who could find love for you

1750
02:16:22.656 --> 02:16:24.825
even though you scarred her
on the inside.

1751
02:16:26.261 --> 02:16:30.331
I'm the vengeful bitch
you scarred on the outside.

1752
02:16:33.501 --> 02:16:34.701
No!

1753
02:16:53.654 --> 02:16:55.733
Shit.

1754
02:16:55.823 --> 02:16:57.936
<i>Ives, she's killed him.
Ives, do you copy? She's killed him.</i>

1755
02:16:58.026 --> 02:17:01.096
She jumped the gun.
She killed him.

1756
02:17:19.180 --> 02:17:22.016
Come on, come on!
Do you think they made it?

1757
02:17:26.421 --> 02:17:27.754
Ah, screw it.

1758
02:18:38.126 --> 02:18:40.805
<i>Kat!
You jumped the gun!</i>

1759
02:18:40.895 --> 02:18:42.673
I couldn't do it.

1760
02:18:42.763 --> 02:18:44.843
I couldn't let him die
thinking he'd won.

1761
02:18:44.933 --> 02:18:47.711
I knew you'd find a way.

1762
02:18:47.801 --> 02:18:49.713
Wait, you found a way,
we're okay, right?

1763
02:18:49.803 --> 02:18:51.906
<i>Yeah, found a way. Be safe.</i>

1764
02:19:13.695 --> 02:19:15.306
Thought you were inverted.

1765
02:19:15.396 --> 02:19:17.165
Changed gears halfway.

1766
02:19:18.366 --> 02:19:20.178
Looked like you
needed help here.

1767
02:19:20.268 --> 02:19:22.769
Here?
We needed help down there.

1768
02:19:23.804 --> 02:19:25.917
How'd you get that lock open?

1769
02:19:26.007 --> 02:19:28.276
Wasn't me.
Didn't your team need you?

1770
02:19:29.177 --> 02:19:31.112
I'll get 'em on the next pass.

1771
02:19:31.745 --> 02:19:33.158
All right, Ives?

1772
02:19:33.248 --> 02:19:35.149
Once I've caught my breath.

1773
02:19:49.130 --> 02:19:51.832
No one who's seen this
leaves the field.

1774
02:20:00.541 --> 02:20:02.143
All right.

1775
02:20:05.546 --> 02:20:07.048
We hide it.

1776
02:20:07.749 --> 02:20:09.861
We end our lives.

1777
02:20:09.951 --> 02:20:12.320
That's the only way to be sure.

1778
02:20:13.921 --> 02:20:16.067
As to when...

1779
02:20:16.157 --> 02:20:18.859
maybe that's every man's
decision to make for himself.

1780
02:20:19.761 --> 02:20:21.039
You're not gonna kill us?

1781
02:20:21.129 --> 02:20:23.675
If I ever find you, I will.

1782
02:20:23.765 --> 02:20:25.333
But you won't look too hard?

1783
02:20:26.367 --> 02:20:27.502
Yes, I will.

1784
02:20:31.139 --> 02:20:33.351
You're not going back to London
to check on Kat, are you?

1785
02:20:33.441 --> 02:20:34.152
No.

1786
02:20:34.242 --> 02:20:36.077
It's far too dangerous.

1787
02:20:36.744 --> 02:20:38.413
Even from afar?

1788
02:20:39.614 --> 02:20:41.149
Even from afar.

1789
02:20:43.384 --> 02:20:44.519
Ives!

1790
02:20:45.520 --> 02:20:46.921
Wait.

1791
02:20:52.994 --> 02:20:54.595
Are you really going back in?

1792
02:20:57.098 --> 02:21:00.378
I'm the only one who could've got
that door open in time, right, Ives?

1793
02:21:00.468 --> 02:21:03.237
Well, I don't know any
locksmiths as good as you.

1794
02:21:04.605 --> 02:21:06.384
See?

1795
02:21:06.474 --> 02:21:08.553
It's me in there, again.

1796
02:21:08.643 --> 02:21:11.979
Weaving another past
in the fabric of this mission.

1797
02:21:20.455 --> 02:21:21.522
Neil, wait!

1798
02:21:25.760 --> 02:21:27.771
Just saved the world.

1799
02:21:27.861 --> 02:21:30.141
Can't leave anything to chance.

1800
02:21:30.231 --> 02:21:33.077
But can we change things
if we do it differently?

1801
02:21:33.167 --> 02:21:35.380
"What's happened's happened."

1802
02:21:35.470 --> 02:21:39.117
Which is an expression of faith
in the mechanics of the world.

1803
02:21:39.207 --> 02:21:41.042
It's not an excuse
to do nothing.

1804
02:21:41.509 --> 02:21:42.420
Fate?

1805
02:21:42.510 --> 02:21:44.055
Call it what you want.

1806
02:21:44.145 --> 02:21:45.346
What do you call it?

1807
02:21:46.247 --> 02:21:47.348
Reality.

1808
02:21:49.884 --> 02:21:51.319
Now let me go.

1809
02:21:56.691 --> 02:21:59.570
Hey, you never did tell me
who recruited you, Neil.

1810
02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:01.429
Haven't you guessed by now?

1811
02:22:02.430 --> 02:22:03.908
You did.

1812
02:22:03.998 --> 02:22:06.678
Only not when you thought.

1813
02:22:06.768 --> 02:22:09.080
You have a future in the past.

1814
02:22:09.170 --> 02:22:12.340
Years ago for me.
Years from now for you.

1815
02:22:13.174 --> 02:22:14.909
You've known me for years?

1816
02:22:16.411 --> 02:22:20.258
For me, I think this is the end
of a beautiful friendship.

1817
02:22:20.348 --> 02:22:22.860
But for me,
it's just the beginning.

1818
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:25.129
We get up to some stuff.

1819
02:22:25.219 --> 02:22:28.399
You're gonna love it.
You'll see.

1820
02:22:28.489 --> 02:22:31.092
This whole operation's
a temporal pincer.

1821
02:22:31.559 --> 02:22:32.960
Whose?

1822
02:22:34.328 --> 02:22:35.873
Yours!

1823
02:22:35.963 --> 02:22:37.442
You're only halfway there.

1824
02:22:37.532 --> 02:22:39.567
I'll see you
at the beginning, friend.

1825
02:22:48.009 --> 02:22:51.389
<i>We're the people saving the
world from what might have been.</i>

1826
02:22:51.479 --> 02:22:53.414
<i>World will never know
what could've happened.</i>

1827
02:22:55.283 --> 02:22:58.319
<i>And even if they did,
they wouldn't care.</i>

1828
02:23:02.156 --> 02:23:04.959
<i>'Cause no one cares about
the bomb that didn't go off.</i>

1829
02:23:05.726 --> 02:23:07.562
<i>Only the one that did.</i>

1830
02:23:10.064 --> 02:23:11.399
Do it before the boy comes out.

1831
02:23:13.936 --> 02:23:17.215
That's your idea of mercy?
You gave me your word.

1832
02:23:17.305 --> 02:23:20.853
And I told you then
what it would be worth.

1833
02:23:20.943 --> 02:23:23.044
Here, today.

1834
02:23:24.145 --> 02:23:27.358
How did you know?

1835
02:23:27.448 --> 02:23:30.829
<i>Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...</i>

1836
02:23:30.919 --> 02:23:32.196
Posterity.

1837
02:23:32.286 --> 02:23:35.868
Cannon Place, 3:00.
Probably nothing, I'm...

1838
02:23:35.958 --> 02:23:39.704
I told you you'd have to start
looking differently at the world.

1839
02:23:39.794 --> 02:23:42.841
- I have to tie up the loose ends.
- That was never your job.

1840
02:23:42.931 --> 02:23:44.041
Then whose was it?

1841
02:23:44.131 --> 02:23:46.010
Mine.

1842
02:23:46.100 --> 02:23:49.547
I realized I wasn't working for you.
We've both been working for me.

1843
02:23:49.637 --> 02:23:51.310
I'm the protagonist.

1844
02:23:53.741 --> 02:23:57.078
Then you'd better tie up
those loose ends.

1845
02:23:59.847 --> 02:24:01.382
Mission accomplished.

1846
02:24:03.251 --> 02:24:05.463
<i>It's the bomb that
didn't go off.</i>

1847
02:24:05.553 --> 02:24:08.322
<i>The danger no one knew was real.</i>

1848
02:24:13.361 --> 02:24:16.631
