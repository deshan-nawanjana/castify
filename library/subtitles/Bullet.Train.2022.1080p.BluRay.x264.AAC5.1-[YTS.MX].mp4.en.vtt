00:01:40.684 --> 00:01:43.645
The boomslang was stolen
from the zoo last night.

2
00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.398
It's extremely dangerous.

3
00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.099
Father.

4
00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:24.895
Any news on my grandson?

5
00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:29.775
No change.

6
00:02:31.443 --> 00:02:32.569
He hasn't woken up.

7
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:36.740
A father's job is to protect his family.

8
00:02:38.367 --> 00:02:40.118
When Wataru was on that roof...

9
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.540
when he was pushed...

10
00:02:47.793 --> 00:02:49.211
where was his father?

11
00:02:54.842 --> 00:02:56.176
Wataru is lucky.

12
00:02:56.844 --> 00:03:00.722
You never know what horrible fate

13
00:03:01.557 --> 00:03:03.433
your bad luck has saved you from.

14
00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.151
Thank you for taking the job
on such short notice.

15
00:03:54.234 --> 00:03:58.030
I am ready. You are getting
the new and improved me.

16
00:03:58.113 --> 00:03:59.364
Since I've been working with Barry,

17
00:03:59.448 --> 00:04:04.244
I am experiencing a calm
like never before. Never.

18
00:04:04.328 --> 00:04:06.246
Like, I'm less reactive to situations,

19
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.081
I'm more accepting
of people's shortcomings.

20
00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:11.835
I was a little uncertain about coming
back to work, but it's like Barry says:

21
00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.588
You put peace out in the world,
you get peace back.

22
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:16.590
I think your new therapist
might be forgetting

23
00:04:16.673 --> 00:04:18.592
what you do for a living, little Ladybug.

24
00:04:19.468 --> 00:04:22.304
-Ladybug?
-Your new operational name.

25
00:04:22.387 --> 00:04:24.973
-Ladybug? Really?
-You don't like it?

26
00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:26.391
-Do you like it?
-I like it.

27
00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:27.976
Well, if you like it, all right.

28
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.231
Oh, I see what you're doing.
Ladybugs are supposed to be lucky.

29
00:04:38.237 --> 00:04:40.614
-You don't have bad luck.
-Really?

30
00:04:42.157 --> 00:04:46.578
My bad luck is biblical. I'm not even
trying to kill people and someone dies.

31
00:04:46.662 --> 00:04:47.704
That's an exaggeration.

32
00:04:47.788 --> 00:04:49.623
It is? My last job?

33
00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.875
-The political blackmail photos?
-I voted for you.

34
00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:54.461
Remember the suicidal bellboy
climbed the roof of his hotel,

35
00:04:54.586 --> 00:04:55.921
couldn't take it anymore?

36
00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:02.970
Seems more like his bad luck
than yours.

37
00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:05.681
Hang in there, buddy!

38
00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:07.307
And he didn't die.

39
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:09.643
Okay? You drove him to the hospital.
It's good luck.

40
00:05:09.726 --> 00:05:11.562
-All in how you frame it.
-Sure.

41
00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:14.147
Gotta say I like it here.
I could live here.

42
00:05:14.731 --> 00:05:17.860
I like the atmosphere,
the people are considerate....

43
00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:22.698
Except for that guy.

44
00:05:25.242 --> 00:05:26.285
Why is this job paying so well?

45
00:05:26.368 --> 00:05:28.537
It was supposed to be Carver's,
but he's got some stomach thing.

46
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.706
-Carver?
-And he doesn't do snatch-and-grabs.

47
00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.293
I'm filling in for Carver?
You picked me second to Carver?

48
00:05:34.376 --> 00:05:36.670
You said you wanted simple
for your first job back.

49
00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:37.963
Doesn't get simpler.

50
00:05:38.755 --> 00:05:40.007
-Shit.
-Shit what?

51
00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.384
I think I must have lost the key
when that guy bumped into me.

52
00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.845
-What's the number again?
-523.

53
00:05:52.978 --> 00:05:54.021
Carver.

54
00:05:54.104 --> 00:05:55.564
What an ego.

55
00:05:56.106 --> 00:05:59.109
I mean, talk about
a candidate for self-improvement.

56
00:05:59.234 --> 00:06:01.653
Calling in sick?
I mean, what is that, high school?

57
00:06:02.112 --> 00:06:03.572
I can hear that personal growth.

58
00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:07.326
I know I'm being judgmental.
I need to work on that.

59
00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:09.703
But, Jesus, what a douchebag.

60
00:06:09.786 --> 00:06:12.289
You have the strangest requests.
Firecrackers?

61
00:06:12.372 --> 00:06:13.457
I'm industrious.

62
00:06:15.167 --> 00:06:17.503
Please tell me
you didn't order the sleeping powder.

63
00:06:17.586 --> 00:06:18.420
Nope.

64
00:06:18.504 --> 00:06:20.714
You almost gave that bodyguard
in Anchorage a heart attack.

65
00:06:20.797 --> 00:06:22.341
I've worked on the dosage.

66
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.009
Take the gun.

67
00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:35.270
Ticket please.

68
00:06:38.982 --> 00:06:40.359
Thank you for using our train.

69
00:06:40.442 --> 00:06:41.944
First class is that way.

70
00:06:44.196 --> 00:06:47.032
-I'm gonna assume you didn't take the gun?
-Barry says every conflict

71
00:06:47.157 --> 00:06:49.826
is an opportunity for a peaceful....
What was it?

72
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.704
And your handler says
some conflicts require a gun.

73
00:06:52.788 --> 00:06:53.705
Shit.

74
00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:03.173
Okay, I'm on.

75
00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:04.383
Well, that's a start.

76
00:07:05.175 --> 00:07:07.219
Hey, this is nice.

77
00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.136
Economy?

78
00:07:08.637 --> 00:07:12.057
I'm thinking of starting my own agency.
You know, all simple jobs, all the time.

79
00:07:12.182 --> 00:07:13.642
That's a terrible business plan.

80
00:07:13.725 --> 00:07:17.563
No more sociopaths, no more maniacs.
Just quality people.

81
00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:20.148
Barry says it's time for some change.
I think he's right.

82
00:07:20.232 --> 00:07:22.359
Barry does not know
what you do for a living.

83
00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.945
Okay, here we go.
The bullet train has 16 cars.

84
00:07:25.028 --> 00:07:26.989
Ten economy, six first-class,

85
00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:29.449
and remember,
only one minute stop at every station.

86
00:07:36.415 --> 00:07:38.166
Bloody fuckin' hell. Do you mind?

87
00:07:39.835 --> 00:07:41.879
What is he, fucking blind or something?

88
00:07:44.006 --> 00:07:47.092
Come on. No, you don't
have to nick the biscuits, man.

89
00:07:48.427 --> 00:07:50.679
Oh, no. You all right? Okay, cool.

90
00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:52.222
-Fucking asshole.
-Thank you.

91
00:07:53.557 --> 00:07:54.808
Why'd I do that?

92
00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:57.519
It's like I got a compulsion or something.
I have to take it if I see it.

93
00:07:57.603 --> 00:07:59.563
Need to talk to someone. Serious.

94
00:07:59.646 --> 00:08:02.524
A goldfish biscuit?
I mean, I don't understand it.

95
00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:06.153
Okay, simple snatch-and-grab.
What am I snatching and/or grabbing?

96
00:08:06.236 --> 00:08:09.698
A briefcase. Intel says
there's a train sticker on the handle.

97
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.576
Briefcases have owners.
Owners are not simple.

98
00:08:12.701 --> 00:08:15.329
And the last update says
the owners will be in economy class.

99
00:08:15.412 --> 00:08:18.832
Owners, plural?
Why didn't you tell me to bring that gun?

100
00:08:18.957 --> 00:08:21.293
I did.
You chose spiritual enlightenment.

101
00:08:22.586 --> 00:08:23.795
Chiketto, please.

102
00:08:23.879 --> 00:08:24.755
Ticket.

103
00:08:25.506 --> 00:08:26.423
Hold on.

104
00:08:27.341 --> 00:08:29.134
Ah, no, no. Receipt.

105
00:08:32.304 --> 00:08:34.389
Shit, I think I dropped my ticket, too.

106
00:08:36.141 --> 00:08:38.727
That receipt shows
I bought a ticket, though, right?

107
00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:42.898
One stop.

108
00:08:43.815 --> 00:08:44.733
Yep.

109
00:08:50.113 --> 00:08:51.698
I thought they bowed here.

110
00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:02.626
I PUSHED HIM. FIRST CLASS, SEAT B4

111
00:09:26.984 --> 00:09:29.653
Sorry, kid. I'm looking for...

112
00:09:37.411 --> 00:09:38.495
You found her.

113
00:09:41.665 --> 00:09:43.542
-Oh, Lemon.
-Tangerine.

114
00:09:43.625 --> 00:09:44.751
You're bleeding, mate.

115
00:09:44.835 --> 00:09:47.296
Oh, mate, shit. Oh, shit, man.

116
00:09:47.379 --> 00:09:48.380
Who the fuck did I kill?

117
00:09:48.463 --> 00:09:50.424
-Get a Wet One on it or something.
-It's not mine, mate.

118
00:09:50.507 --> 00:09:52.134
-Oh, it's not yours?
-Yeah. I don't bleed.

119
00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:54.720
In that case, leave your jacket open,
let everyone have a good old look.

120
00:09:54.845 --> 00:09:57.264
-Yeah, I want everyone to see my tie.
-Fuck is wrong with you?

121
00:09:57.347 --> 00:09:59.433
Pull your coat together
so no one else notices, Lemon.

122
00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.727
I think they'll notice
the childish code names first.

123
00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:04.521
But if we're gonna stick with fruit,
why not apple or orange?

124
00:10:05.397 --> 00:10:06.607
So, what's in this case?

125
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:08.066
Are we doing this?

126
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:09.860
You know what's in the case.

127
00:10:09.943 --> 00:10:11.695
Money. It's always money.

128
00:10:11.778 --> 00:10:13.530
Tangerines are sophisticated.

129
00:10:13.655 --> 00:10:15.115
Now he's callin' a fruit sophisticated.

130
00:10:15.199 --> 00:10:16.867
Yeah, it's cross-hybridized
with other fruit.

131
00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:19.536
They're adaptable. Like me.

132
00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:22.623
You said six cars in economy,

133
00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:25.542
say 30 passengers per car,

134
00:10:25.626 --> 00:10:29.505
guessing two bags per,
let's see, times two and you carry--

135
00:10:29.588 --> 00:10:32.216
Yeah, no fuckin' way
I'm gonna find one brie--

136
00:10:33.175 --> 00:10:34.176
-Wait.
-What?

137
00:10:34.259 --> 00:10:35.677
-Train sticker on the handle?
-Yeah.

138
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:37.179
Holy shitbox.

139
00:10:40.641 --> 00:10:42.601
-And why am I Lemon?
-Because you're sour.

140
00:10:42.684 --> 00:10:44.520
-No one likes lemons.
-That's bollocks, mate.

141
00:10:44.603 --> 00:10:45.562
Lemonades, lemon drops.

142
00:10:45.646 --> 00:10:47.231
-You got a sore throat?
-Lemon meringue pie.

143
00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:49.525
When's the last time
you ate lemon meringue pie?

144
00:10:49.608 --> 00:10:52.069
-Lemon drizzle cake.
-I'm sorry, are you talking about lemons?

145
00:10:52.694 --> 00:10:54.696
-I have the case.
-Well, that's great.

146
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:56.114
-Is it?
-Yes.

147
00:10:56.198 --> 00:10:57.991
-What's the catch?
-There is a no catch.

148
00:10:58.075 --> 00:11:00.410
-There's always a catch.
-Get off the train.

149
00:11:02.037 --> 00:11:04.164
Quite like lemons. I just hate code names.

150
00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.460
Oh, well, look at this. Sleeping Beauty.

151
00:11:09.127 --> 00:11:11.713
-Wakey, wakey.
-Eggs and bakey.

152
00:11:13.966 --> 00:11:14.925
Where am I?

153
00:11:21.765 --> 00:11:24.268
You're safe now. Your father sent us.

154
00:11:24.935 --> 00:11:26.270
You idiots work for my father?

155
00:11:26.353 --> 00:11:29.356
Ooh, easy, we could deliver you
back to your pops in a box.

156
00:11:29.439 --> 00:11:32.401
Technically, we're outside contractors.

157
00:11:33.068 --> 00:11:35.195
I'm Tangerine. He's Lemon.

158
00:11:35.779 --> 00:11:37.197
Like the fruit?

159
00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:42.911
-You ever watch Thomas the Tank Engine?
-Here we go.

160
00:11:42.995 --> 00:11:45.956
Hey, you watch something nowadays,
what is it, huh? Nothing.

161
00:11:46.039 --> 00:11:48.041
It's twists, violence, drama, no message.

162
00:11:48.125 --> 00:11:50.294
What's the point? Huh?

163
00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:52.129
What are we supposed to learn?

164
00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:55.424
Everything I learned about people
I learned from Thomas.

165
00:11:55.507 --> 00:11:58.302
-You bring your sticker book, did ya?
-You know I always bring my stickers.

166
00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:02.222
Take Tangerine here.
He's a Gordon. This blue one.

167
00:12:02.306 --> 00:12:04.516
And Gordon is the strongest,
the most important.

168
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:06.518
But he doesn't always listen to others.

169
00:12:07.394 --> 00:12:08.520
What's that, now?

170
00:12:08.604 --> 00:12:10.939
I mean, some people are Edwards.
Wise, kind.

171
00:12:11.023 --> 00:12:13.942
Some are Henrys.
Hard-working, strong.

172
00:12:14.026 --> 00:12:16.320
Some people are Diesels.

173
00:12:16.403 --> 00:12:17.529
Fuck me!

174
00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:20.991
Those are trouble.

175
00:12:21.074 --> 00:12:22.367
You, though....

176
00:12:23.493 --> 00:12:26.788
Yeah, you seem like a Percy.

177
00:12:27.372 --> 00:12:28.248
Young.

178
00:12:28.332 --> 00:12:30.083
Sweet.

179
00:12:30.209 --> 00:12:31.335
Not all there.

180
00:12:33.128 --> 00:12:34.171
You finished, both of you?

181
00:12:36.048 --> 00:12:38.091
-Yeah.
-Right. Your daddy

182
00:12:38.175 --> 00:12:40.719
hired us to get you out of the trouble
you got yourself into, naughty boy.

183
00:12:40.802 --> 00:12:43.430
-Why are you Tangerine, though?
-Oh, it's sophisticated, mate.

184
00:12:43.514 --> 00:12:46.058
Oh, fuckin' hell.
It's not important, is it?

185
00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.560
What is important
are the 17 dead bodies we left

186
00:12:48.644 --> 00:12:50.270
getting you back from the Triad
that kidnapped you

187
00:12:50.354 --> 00:12:52.481
with the plans to ransom you to your
extremely psychotic fucked-up father.

188
00:12:52.564 --> 00:12:53.815
Actually, it's 16.

189
00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:56.109
What's that, now?

190
00:12:56.193 --> 00:12:58.111
-Sixteen kills, mate.
-No, it was 17.

191
00:12:58.195 --> 00:12:59.988
-It's 16.
-Seven.

192
00:13:00.072 --> 00:13:01.365
You're startin' to get on my fucking tits.

193
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:02.950
-Sixteen.
-I'll smash my fucking head

194
00:13:03.033 --> 00:13:04.701
-through a brick wall.
-Maybe that'd help your memory

195
00:13:04.785 --> 00:13:05.994
'cause it was 16.

196
00:13:06.078 --> 00:13:08.080
It was 17, goddamn it.
I wanna fucking strangle you now.

197
00:13:08.163 --> 00:13:09.289
Do you mind if we do this right now?

198
00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.004
One.

199
00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:20.759
Two, three.

200
00:13:27.641 --> 00:13:28.976
Five guys playing poker.

201
00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:44.032
Keep moving!

202
00:13:44.116 --> 00:13:45.534
-Big guy.
-Yeah, big guy.

203
00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.161
Sometime today!

204
00:13:50.205 --> 00:13:51.039
Ten.

205
00:13:55.085 --> 00:13:56.211
Three assholes with swords.

206
00:13:57.337 --> 00:13:58.505
Fucking get it. Fuck!

207
00:14:00.924 --> 00:14:01.842
Why do you always bring swords?

208
00:14:01.967 --> 00:14:03.635
Fucking Triad. You would, wouldn't ya?

209
00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:06.805
You son of a bitch!

210
00:14:09.808 --> 00:14:10.934
I like swords, actually.

211
00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:14.855
Looks like it's time for a Jaffa Cake.

212
00:14:14.938 --> 00:14:16.148
How about a Wagon Wheel?

213
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:17.065
Oh, that works.

214
00:14:17.941 --> 00:14:19.276
Swing!

215
00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:25.699
Fourteen, fifteen.

216
00:14:28.285 --> 00:14:29.870
And the prick on the motorcycle.

217
00:14:37.669 --> 00:14:38.921
-So 16.
-You forgot the poor,

218
00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:41.131
-innocent civilian on the street.
-The fuck you--?

219
00:14:41.215 --> 00:14:44.343
Hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy, you okay? Oh, my--

220
00:14:46.261 --> 00:14:48.347
Shit. That wasn't our fault.

221
00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:49.765
-Wasn't our fault?
-No.

222
00:14:49.848 --> 00:14:51.683
Well, what would
Thomas the Tank Engine say, Lemon?

223
00:14:51.767 --> 00:14:53.185
That's really mean.

224
00:14:53.268 --> 00:14:55.187
He'd say,
"Hey, take responsibility, mate."

225
00:14:55.270 --> 00:14:56.688
He doesn't sound like that.

226
00:14:58.023 --> 00:15:00.275
Gonna put a little distance
between me and the owners.

227
00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.069
-Are you nervous?
-Yeah, I'm nervous.

228
00:15:02.152 --> 00:15:03.904
-You sound nervous.
-Because I am, in fact, nervous.

229
00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:07.074
Hey, listen,
I'm just gonna get off at the next stop.

230
00:15:07.157 --> 00:15:09.785
Oh, let's have a seat, then, huh?

231
00:15:09.868 --> 00:15:11.286
Do you know
what they call your papushka?

232
00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:12.538
Course I fucking do.

233
00:15:12.621 --> 00:15:14.790
The White Death. Not exactly a fruit.

234
00:15:14.873 --> 00:15:16.124
No. There you go.

235
00:15:16.208 --> 00:15:17.793
There's a story--
Stop me if you've heard it.

236
00:15:17.876 --> 00:15:19.503
--where this woman found herself

237
00:15:19.586 --> 00:15:22.339
in the unfortunate position
of owing your father a tidy sum of money.

238
00:15:22.422 --> 00:15:26.051
Now, the issue was it took her
some time to acquire this money.

239
00:15:26.802 --> 00:15:29.304
But she did pay it back
five minutes late, didn't she?

240
00:15:29.388 --> 00:15:31.306
-Yeah, what'd he do?
-Cut her arm off.

241
00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:32.516
-Fuckin' hell!
-Yeah.

242
00:15:32.599 --> 00:15:34.309
He said she owed him a finger
for every minute.

243
00:15:36.186 --> 00:15:38.480
He's not a monster. He didn't
make her sit through it five times.

244
00:15:38.564 --> 00:15:40.107
He just cut once, didn't he?

245
00:15:43.569 --> 00:15:45.612
-This is too easy.
-You're overthinking it.

246
00:15:45.696 --> 00:15:47.406
-You're underthinking it.
-It's not a word.

247
00:15:47.489 --> 00:15:48.365
-Yes, it is.
-Really?

248
00:15:48.448 --> 00:15:49.241
I think it is.

249
00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:50.784
-Did you google it?
-Doesn't matter.

250
00:15:50.868 --> 00:15:51.743
What would Barry say?

251
00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:54.621
Barry would say, "A negative outlook
leads to a negative outcome."

252
00:15:54.705 --> 00:15:56.748
Wow. How much do you pay him again?

253
00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.793
Our job is to keep you safe

254
00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:02.462
and to recover the briefcase
with the ransom money inside.

255
00:16:02.546 --> 00:16:05.507
And I plan on completin' my job
and keeping....

256
00:16:06.425 --> 00:16:08.302
Lemon. Where's the briefcase?

257
00:16:08.385 --> 00:16:09.928
Oh, I stashed it.

258
00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:12.806
The case, Lemon.

259
00:16:12.890 --> 00:16:14.808
Go get me the fucking case.

260
00:16:15.434 --> 00:16:18.312
You're a liability, you know?
To my father.

261
00:16:21.899 --> 00:16:24.234
He doesn't need a reason
to kill people like you.

262
00:16:24.318 --> 00:16:25.861
He needs a reason not to.

263
00:16:27.404 --> 00:16:29.072
Does he have one?

264
00:16:32.492 --> 00:16:33.869
That's fucking confusin'.

265
00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:37.080
-Hello?
-Do you have White Death's son?

266
00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:38.999
You mean this dickhead
with the silly face tattoos?

267
00:16:39.082 --> 00:16:40.626
-He's sat right here.
-And the briefcase?

268
00:16:40.709 --> 00:16:42.628
Yes, of course, I've got the case.

269
00:16:43.462 --> 00:16:45.672
You will both deboard at Kyoto station.

270
00:16:45.756 --> 00:16:48.258
Then your business with him
will be concluded.

271
00:16:59.353 --> 00:17:00.729
It was just here.

272
00:17:01.605 --> 00:17:02.814
Well, it's not anymore.

273
00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:05.859
We need to find
the person who took that case.

274
00:17:07.569 --> 00:17:08.737
Maybe you're right.

275
00:17:09.947 --> 00:17:11.823
Maybe my luck is starting to turn.

276
00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:39.893
You.

277
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:42.145
Yes.

278
00:17:43.313 --> 00:17:44.231
Me.

279
00:17:44.773 --> 00:17:46.942
But you are Yuichi Kimura.

280
00:17:47.025 --> 00:17:50.571
And you came here to kill me.

281
00:17:51.864 --> 00:17:54.074
My parents call me malen'kiy prints.

282
00:17:54.741 --> 00:17:57.786
That means little prince.
Obviously, they wanted a boy.

283
00:18:03.417 --> 00:18:06.670
You're going to want
to hear the whole story.

284
00:18:06.753 --> 00:18:10.215
Or you'll be very, very sorry.

285
00:18:15.095 --> 00:18:15.971
It's the hospital.

286
00:18:16.054 --> 00:18:17.472
Hang on.

287
00:18:17.556 --> 00:18:20.475
Hi. Yes, you can see the boy now.

288
00:18:21.894 --> 00:18:25.272
Good. If you don't hear from me
every ten minutes

289
00:18:25.355 --> 00:18:27.316
or if I don't answer this phone
when you call,

290
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.612
I want you to go in there and kill....

291
00:18:34.823 --> 00:18:37.117
I'm sorry, what's your boy's name again?

292
00:18:37.242 --> 00:18:38.535
Wataru.

293
00:18:38.619 --> 00:18:40.787
Right. Right.

294
00:18:40.871 --> 00:18:42.164
Kill Wataru.

295
00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:46.710
Aren't we glad we waited?

296
00:18:46.793 --> 00:18:48.378
We got his son. That was our job.

297
00:18:48.462 --> 00:18:52.424
Our job was to come back
with his son and his $10 million.

298
00:18:52.508 --> 00:18:54.218
Three words describe
our situation right now.

299
00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:57.429
-Do you know what they are?
-Sure do. Saved...his...son.

300
00:18:58.305 --> 00:18:59.723
Family's more important
than money, right?

301
00:18:59.806 --> 00:19:02.434
Do you honestly not know
who the White Death is?

302
00:19:02.518 --> 00:19:04.895
I know the White Death.
You just told me 5 minutes ago.

303
00:19:04.978 --> 00:19:07.105
Why do I even bother
forwarding you the briefings?

304
00:19:07.981 --> 00:19:09.149
I do not know.

305
00:19:13.987 --> 00:19:17.991
The Japanese underworld
used to be ruled by a man named Minegishi.

306
00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:23.038
Now, Minegishi was one brutal bastard.

307
00:19:23.622 --> 00:19:24.998
But he was old-school, you know?

308
00:19:25.082 --> 00:19:27.125
Tradition and loyalty
was all that mattered to him.

309
00:19:27.876 --> 00:19:29.753
When you were in, you were in.
You were like family.

310
00:19:29.837 --> 00:19:31.797
He treated you
like you were one of his own.

311
00:19:31.880 --> 00:19:35.551
Then out of the blue comes this
6-foot-fucking-6 geezer from Russia.

312
00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:40.514
Whispers that he was exiled from the
Russian mafia or that he was ex-KGB.

313
00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:43.100
No one really knows the truth.

314
00:19:44.476 --> 00:19:47.229
But what is known is this Russian

315
00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.524
worked his way up the ranks.

316
00:19:50.607 --> 00:19:52.484
Bit by bit. Kill by kill.

317
00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:58.740
And very, very fucking quickly became
one of Minegishi's closest advisors.

318
00:19:59.491 --> 00:20:01.076
And those loyal to him said:

319
00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:04.204
"Hold your horses.
This geezer ain't the full ticket.

320
00:20:04.288 --> 00:20:05.956
He ain't to be trusted."

321
00:20:06.915 --> 00:20:08.292
"He's dangerous," they said.

322
00:20:08.834 --> 00:20:10.460
"A modern plague," they said.

323
00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:12.629
"A White Death."

324
00:20:13.672 --> 00:20:15.465
So, sure enough, they were right.

325
00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.510
He made his own alliance.

326
00:20:20.012 --> 00:20:21.180
His own gang.

327
00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.730
And what'd he do?

328
00:20:29.855 --> 00:20:31.356
Stabbed him in the back.

329
00:20:31.857 --> 00:20:34.484
I mean, metaphorically.
He blew his fucking brains out, didn't he?

330
00:20:46.413 --> 00:20:49.750
He wiped the name Minegishi off
the face of the earth in one single night.

331
00:20:50.375 --> 00:20:52.794
And made an empire
worthy of the White Death.

332
00:20:57.549 --> 00:21:00.677
So, let me put this bluntly.

333
00:21:00.761 --> 00:21:02.596
There's this soulless psychotic leader

334
00:21:02.679 --> 00:21:05.474
with the largest criminal organization
on the planet

335
00:21:05.557 --> 00:21:08.769
shoved right inside
our fucking ass cheeks.

336
00:21:11.897 --> 00:21:13.815
That motherfucker's
definitely a Diesel, then, isn't he?

337
00:21:13.899 --> 00:21:16.151
If you mention Thomas the Tank Engine
one more time

338
00:21:16.235 --> 00:21:19.488
-I'm gonna shoot you in the fucking face.
-Okay, if he's such a badass,

339
00:21:19.571 --> 00:21:22.241
how come he hired two random operators
instead of getting his son back himself?

340
00:21:22.324 --> 00:21:24.493
If you actually read the briefings
you'd know that he had a wife.

341
00:21:24.576 --> 00:21:25.661
What, he had a wife?

342
00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:28.497
She was the most important
fucking thing in his life, and she died.

343
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.873
Drunk driving accident or some shit.

344
00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:34.253
And now he's at the compound.
He ain't left since.

345
00:21:34.336 --> 00:21:36.505
An unnamed locomotive
might say there's a lesson to be learned.

346
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:39.132
And he didn't hire
two random operators, Lemon.

347
00:21:39.216 --> 00:21:40.300
No, he asked for the best.

348
00:21:40.384 --> 00:21:42.678
He asked for the two responsible
for the Bolivia job.

349
00:21:48.475 --> 00:21:51.645
He asked for pros who wouldn't fuck up.

350
00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:53.397
Three words, Lemon.

351
00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:54.815
-We are--
-Fucked.

352
00:21:59.444 --> 00:22:00.904
What do you want?

353
00:22:01.446 --> 00:22:03.490
People think
that I'm just some young girl.

354
00:22:06.076 --> 00:22:07.911
Someone's future wife...

355
00:22:08.996 --> 00:22:10.163
or future mother.

356
00:22:12.332 --> 00:22:14.543
But I'm not in someone else's story.

357
00:22:16.753 --> 00:22:18.046
You're all in mine.

358
00:22:19.089 --> 00:22:21.216
The fuck does that have to do with me?

359
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.970
You work for the most feared boss
in the city: The White Death.

360
00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:28.223
Oh, deny it all you want.

361
00:22:28.307 --> 00:22:31.727
But you work for someone who works
for someone else, et cetera, et cetera,

362
00:22:31.852 --> 00:22:34.396
and it all falls under the same person.

363
00:22:35.105 --> 00:22:36.982
You delivered a briefcase two days ago

364
00:22:37.107 --> 00:22:39.610
to one of the White Death's associates,

365
00:22:39.693 --> 00:22:41.236
and I saw my opportunity.

366
00:22:42.112 --> 00:22:44.990
Follow the case and find the White Death.

367
00:22:45.073 --> 00:22:47.284
I don't know
what you think I can do for you.

368
00:22:47.367 --> 00:22:49.995
Oh, that is my favorite part of the story.

369
00:22:50.078 --> 00:22:52.039
You're going to kill him for me.

370
00:22:53.916 --> 00:22:57.419
How the fuck
am I going to kill the White Death?

371
00:22:58.086 --> 00:22:59.213
You'll see.

372
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:02.633
Oh, look at that.

373
00:23:02.716 --> 00:23:04.510
We are right on schedule.

374
00:23:06.678 --> 00:23:08.847
Sit back, relax a little bit.
You look so tense.

375
00:23:22.319 --> 00:23:24.446
We rescued his fucking son.

376
00:23:25.197 --> 00:23:27.991
We find the fucker who took the briefcase,
make things right,

377
00:23:28.075 --> 00:23:29.826
be like it never happened.

378
00:23:37.334 --> 00:23:38.418
You still got that vest on ya?

379
00:23:38.502 --> 00:23:40.921
No, vests give you
a false sense of security.

380
00:23:41.380 --> 00:23:42.548
You might, like, get shot in the neck.

381
00:23:42.631 --> 00:23:44.716
It also stops you
from getting shot in the chest,

382
00:23:44.842 --> 00:23:46.718
but I guess you missed
that episode of Thomas.

383
00:23:47.427 --> 00:23:50.389
I really must've,
because that sounds dark as shit.

384
00:23:51.306 --> 00:23:52.641
Nut up or shut up, bruv.

385
00:24:06.905 --> 00:24:09.449
Well, so, slight change of plans.

386
00:24:18.625 --> 00:24:20.502
First his wife, now his son?

387
00:24:21.253 --> 00:24:22.880
That's a lot of white deaths.

388
00:24:31.597 --> 00:24:35.142
I want you to be strong, son.
Do you understand?

389
00:24:35.976 --> 00:24:37.436
Be strong.

390
00:26:35.554 --> 00:26:36.388
My heart.

391
00:27:13.926 --> 00:27:15.302
No!

392
00:27:23.519 --> 00:27:26.855
Find me the son of a bitch who did this.

393
00:28:25.831 --> 00:28:28.292
You lucky son of a bitch.

394
00:28:28.375 --> 00:28:29.626
You stabbed me?!

395
00:28:31.712 --> 00:28:34.590
-You ruined my life.
-I don't even know you!

396
00:28:39.803 --> 00:28:41.513
I come here for revenge.

397
00:28:42.264 --> 00:28:45.517
The assassin who killed El Saguaro
killed my wife.

398
00:28:46.435 --> 00:28:49.313
But fate made this a two for one special.

399
00:28:58.155 --> 00:29:02.117
Can we just take a time-out here?
Talk this out?

400
00:29:02.201 --> 00:29:03.827
I will never stop coming for you.

401
00:29:03.952 --> 00:29:05.078
What?

402
00:29:05.162 --> 00:29:07.706
Run as far as you like.
I will find you.

403
00:29:07.789 --> 00:29:08.665
Why?

404
00:29:08.749 --> 00:29:12.002
And I will ruin your life
the way you ruined mine!

405
00:29:12.085 --> 00:29:13.670
Dude, I don't even know you!

406
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:38.362
My heart.

407
00:29:46.578 --> 00:29:47.496
What the--?

408
00:29:48.163 --> 00:29:50.207
Wow. Really?

409
00:29:53.836 --> 00:29:56.588
Let this be a lesson
in the toxicity of anger.

410
00:29:59.174 --> 00:30:03.011
Venezuela, Uruguay, Barcelona.

411
00:30:08.183 --> 00:30:09.434
Who are you?

412
00:30:35.127 --> 00:30:39.006
All passengers:
We'll make a brief stop

413
00:30:39.089 --> 00:30:41.216
-at Shin Yokohama.
-All right, mate, try these.

414
00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.677
-They're them Momonga glasses.
-The fuck is a Momonga?

415
00:30:48.265 --> 00:30:50.058
Comes on after Thomas every Thursday.

416
00:30:52.853 --> 00:30:53.854
-Okay.
-It's good.

417
00:30:53.937 --> 00:30:56.857
-Just like that.
-He should look asleep. There, like that.

418
00:31:05.365 --> 00:31:06.742
Wasabi.

419
00:31:08.118 --> 00:31:10.204
We gotta make sure
he doesn't step a foot off this train.

420
00:31:10.287 --> 00:31:12.706
You see the case,
deal with whoever has it.

421
00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:16.126
All right, how do I do that?
Talk to him, or, like, talk to him?

422
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:19.588
Why don't you tell him about the
story about how Gordon met Percy

423
00:31:19.671 --> 00:31:22.299
and how Percy's now bleeding
from his fucking eye sockets!

424
00:31:25.302 --> 00:31:26.178
He means kill him.

425
00:31:26.261 --> 00:31:27.596
All passengers:

426
00:31:28.138 --> 00:31:31.475
-We'll make a brief stop at Shin Yokohama.
-Goddamn it.

427
00:31:41.109 --> 00:31:42.819
Excuse me.

428
00:31:42.903 --> 00:31:45.364
You are fuckin' excused.

429
00:32:07.553 --> 00:32:08.345
Joburg.

430
00:32:19.439 --> 00:32:20.524
I'm sorry, buddy.

431
00:32:22.025 --> 00:32:22.901
Give it!

432
00:32:29.032 --> 00:32:30.576
Shitballs!

433
00:32:30.659 --> 00:32:32.244
That wasn't a minute.

434
00:32:45.799 --> 00:32:47.676
-I missed my stop.
-Why?

435
00:32:47.759 --> 00:32:50.012
-Because God hates me.
-No, she doesn't.

436
00:32:50.095 --> 00:32:51.889
-Do you still have the case?
-Yeah, I stashed it.

437
00:32:51.972 --> 00:32:54.892
-Get off at the next stop.
-It sounds so easy when you say it.

438
00:32:58.312 --> 00:33:00.939
Does the name El Cigarillo
mean anything to you?

439
00:33:02.608 --> 00:33:05.569
-El Saguaro? The cartel boss?
-Yeah, why does that sound so familiar?

440
00:33:05.652 --> 00:33:07.487
He was in the wedding
you infiltrated in Mexico.

441
00:33:08.697 --> 00:33:11.033
-Tequila?
-You were the cocktail server.

442
00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:16.538
The groom.
I knew I recognized that guy.

443
00:33:16.622 --> 00:33:18.749
-I'm really good with faces.
-Wait, what guy?

444
00:33:19.541 --> 00:33:21.210
Sorry. Be right back.

445
00:33:21.293 --> 00:33:23.629
The guy who stabbed me.
I spilled wine on his suit. He's dead now.

446
00:33:23.712 --> 00:33:26.089
-You killed the Wolf?
-It was an accident.

447
00:33:26.173 --> 00:33:29.551
I'm really gonna have to process
my part in the incident on Monday.

448
00:33:29.635 --> 00:33:31.720
Shit! Fuck! No.

449
00:33:31.803 --> 00:33:34.181
Shit. Fuck. What?

450
00:33:34.264 --> 00:33:36.642
Remember those two wackos
from the Bolivia job?

451
00:33:36.725 --> 00:33:39.269
-The Twins?
-Yeah, I'm not so sure they're twins.

452
00:33:39.353 --> 00:33:41.146
Stop it. Everyone knows they're twins.

453
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:43.273
One of them is walking
towards me right now.

454
00:33:44.191 --> 00:33:45.692
I think I saw the other
one on the platform.

455
00:33:45.776 --> 00:33:46.610
Occupied.

456
00:33:46.693 --> 00:33:48.362
Now we know
who the owners of the case are.

457
00:33:48.445 --> 00:33:49.863
This is exactly what I'm talkin' about.

458
00:33:49.947 --> 00:33:51.823
We have to have a hard discussion
about the caliber of people

459
00:33:51.907 --> 00:33:53.825
-we are surrounding ourselves with.
-Why are we whispering?

460
00:34:00.123 --> 00:34:01.750
-Hello.
-The White Death would like to know

461
00:34:01.834 --> 00:34:03.961
-why you stepped off train.
-Wanted some fresh air.

462
00:34:04.503 --> 00:34:06.755
Your orders were to stay on the train.

463
00:34:06.839 --> 00:34:09.925
I didn't realize I was gettin'
a babysitter to come cut my bollocks.

464
00:34:10.008 --> 00:34:13.679
I'm a professional. We're making sure
the case and his son are perfectly safe.

465
00:34:14.513 --> 00:34:16.306
Can I please go do my job now?

466
00:34:16.390 --> 00:34:18.600
Oh, very kind of you.
Thank you very much.

467
00:34:23.939 --> 00:34:26.984
Fuck me! Jesus Christ.

468
00:34:27.067 --> 00:34:30.028
It's very rude, talking on the phone,
on the train in Japan.

469
00:34:30.112 --> 00:34:32.197
This rude enough for ya,
ya fucking prick?

470
00:34:32.281 --> 00:34:35.242
Shove that fuckin' hat
up your fuckin' asshole, you hear me?

471
00:34:38.954 --> 00:34:39.955
Fuck this job.

472
00:34:40.038 --> 00:34:42.124
I knew we should have got an upgrade,
fuck all.

473
00:34:42.207 --> 00:34:43.709
I beg your pardon, sorry.

474
00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:46.628
I wasn't aware
there was a young lady present. Apologize.

475
00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.757
You didn't happen to see someone come by
with a silver briefcase, did ya?

476
00:34:50.841 --> 00:34:52.634
There's a little train sticker
by the handle.

477
00:34:54.553 --> 00:34:55.596
Actually, yeah.

478
00:34:55.679 --> 00:34:58.932
A man with black framed glasses had it.
He went that way.

479
00:35:02.978 --> 00:35:03.812
Thank you, love.

480
00:35:05.856 --> 00:35:07.566
That fucking bastard.

481
00:35:10.611 --> 00:35:11.653
Come on.

482
00:35:16.366 --> 00:35:18.535
"Guy in black glasses. Stop him."

483
00:35:19.828 --> 00:35:22.706
Hi. There's a gun under this table--

484
00:35:23.248 --> 00:35:27.461
This is the quiet car. Gotta use
your small inside voice in here, son.

485
00:35:30.214 --> 00:35:33.550
There's a gun underneath this table
pointed right at you, so I would--

486
00:35:33.634 --> 00:35:35.594
-I can't really hear what you're saying.
-There's a gun--

487
00:35:37.888 --> 00:35:39.806
I'm just fuckin' with you, mate.

488
00:35:41.517 --> 00:35:43.185
It's been a long time
since Johannesburg.

489
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.480
Yeah. Who the fuck are you?

490
00:35:47.022 --> 00:35:49.149
Really. You don't remember me?

491
00:35:51.443 --> 00:35:53.529
You look like every white homeless man
I've ever seen.

492
00:35:54.238 --> 00:35:55.197
Okay.

493
00:35:56.406 --> 00:35:58.659
Well, I have something
I believe you're looking f--

494
00:35:58.742 --> 00:36:01.328
-Really? You don't remember me?
-I remember Johannesburg,

495
00:36:01.411 --> 00:36:03.163
-but I don't remember you.
-You shot me.

496
00:36:05.332 --> 00:36:06.625
-I shoot a lot of people.
-You shot me twice.

497
00:36:06.708 --> 00:36:08.544
Ow!

498
00:36:09.670 --> 00:36:11.505
Well, you also have a shootable face.

499
00:36:12.297 --> 00:36:13.632
I know you're Black Framed Glasses.

500
00:36:13.715 --> 00:36:16.176
The cheeky fucker
who took our briefcase.

501
00:36:17.886 --> 00:36:19.429
Yes. Yes, I am.

502
00:36:21.056 --> 00:36:23.934
You know, I've done a lot
of personal work since Joburg.

503
00:36:24.017 --> 00:36:25.811
I've forgiven, I've moved on.

504
00:36:25.894 --> 00:36:28.730
I've learned that
with any potential conflict

505
00:36:28.814 --> 00:36:31.984
there's an opportunity for growth,
a path to a peaceful outcome.

506
00:36:34.069 --> 00:36:35.153
Interesting.

507
00:36:35.237 --> 00:36:36.196
Who is that?

508
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:38.198
I have no idea.

509
00:36:47.708 --> 00:36:49.543
How did you know that was there?

510
00:36:51.670 --> 00:36:52.671
Didn't I mention?

511
00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:54.673
I've always been lucky.

512
00:36:57.885 --> 00:37:01.597
It was then that I took
a long, hard look into the mirror.

513
00:37:02.139 --> 00:37:03.015
And you know what?

514
00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:05.184
Buddy, I didn't like what I saw.

515
00:37:05.893 --> 00:37:07.436
Nope. Nada.

516
00:37:09.479 --> 00:37:11.815
Until I did. You know?

517
00:37:16.278 --> 00:37:18.071
Between us now sits a wall.

518
00:37:19.865 --> 00:37:21.116
But it's an illusion.

519
00:37:22.784 --> 00:37:25.746
For within every wall, awaits a window--

520
00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.040
Oh, wait, it's a door.

521
00:37:28.123 --> 00:37:31.168
Real quick, every day
is a fucking headache with you, innit?

522
00:37:32.211 --> 00:37:35.088
Right. You and your partner--

523
00:37:35.172 --> 00:37:36.465
I'm Lemon, he's Tangerine.

524
00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:38.425
Okay, Lemon-- Like the fruit?

525
00:37:39.009 --> 00:37:40.093
Blessings.

526
00:37:41.720 --> 00:37:43.430
-What's your plan here?
-Here's the plan.

527
00:37:43.514 --> 00:37:45.849
I give you back your case,
you don't kill me.

528
00:37:45.933 --> 00:37:48.685
You give your case to your employer,
he doesn't kill you.

529
00:37:49.186 --> 00:37:51.813
You're alive, I'm alive,
everyone's happy.

530
00:37:51.897 --> 00:37:52.981
Win-win, don't you think?

531
00:37:53.065 --> 00:37:56.735
How do you know whoever hired you
won't kill you for failing your job?

532
00:37:56.818 --> 00:37:58.487
Lose-lose. No happy.

533
00:37:58.570 --> 00:37:59.988
Man, I just wanna get off this train,

534
00:38:00.072 --> 00:38:02.574
go see a Zen garden
and some shit, you know?

535
00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.703
-I'd like to accept your offer.
-Great.

536
00:38:06.787 --> 00:38:09.039
But then you went and killed someone.
Didn't you?

537
00:38:16.338 --> 00:38:18.382
-How did you know...?
-Wasn't exactly subtle.

538
00:38:18.465 --> 00:38:20.759
It was an accident. Tragic.

539
00:38:20.843 --> 00:38:21.885
Bizarre, even.

540
00:38:21.969 --> 00:38:23.846
Cool story, bro,

541
00:38:23.929 --> 00:38:26.348
but I think you had your own plans
of getting out of here with that case.

542
00:38:26.431 --> 00:38:28.475
-No, no.
-Pinning a body on us.

543
00:38:28.559 --> 00:38:29.476
Hoping the White Death

544
00:38:29.560 --> 00:38:31.937
is so busy cuttin' off our arms
instead of cuttin' off our fingers.

545
00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:35.440
It's like Thomas the Tank Engine
always says: "Simple is better."

546
00:38:35.524 --> 00:38:37.317
-The kids' show?
-Yes, the fucking ki-- Man.

547
00:38:38.068 --> 00:38:39.611
I learned everything
about people from Thomas.

548
00:38:39.695 --> 00:38:40.904
-Everything.
-Really?

549
00:38:40.988 --> 00:38:43.031
It's how I can read people like you
so well.

550
00:38:43.115 --> 00:38:45.617
-And you are a Diesel.
-I am not a Diesel.

551
00:38:45.742 --> 00:38:47.911
-You're the Diesel-est Diesel...
-Not even close.

552
00:38:47.995 --> 00:38:49.705
...I've ever seen in my life, man.

553
00:38:49.788 --> 00:38:51.874
'Cause Diesels bluff. They go too far.

554
00:38:51.999 --> 00:38:53.917
I'm trying to get Diesels
out of my life, you know?

555
00:38:54.001 --> 00:38:57.921
If there was a gun under this table, yeah,
I'd be as dead as that kid over there.

556
00:39:25.449 --> 00:39:26.325
Nope.

557
00:39:31.413 --> 00:39:33.165
You mother--

558
00:39:37.794 --> 00:39:39.963
Have the courage to listen.

559
00:39:57.189 --> 00:39:58.315
Come on, Joburg.

560
00:39:58.941 --> 00:39:59.900
No.

561
00:39:59.983 --> 00:40:01.777
Shot number three.

562
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:18.293
No, no, no. I ain't got the time
or the patience, let alone the interest.

563
00:40:19.086 --> 00:40:20.128
Fucking hell.

564
00:40:21.213 --> 00:40:23.257
Are you following me? Stop!

565
00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:24.299
and $#%*

566
00:40:25.092 --> 00:40:26.426
Asshole!

567
00:40:51.243 --> 00:40:52.411
I'll call the conductor!

568
00:40:52.494 --> 00:40:54.413
Eat a bag of dicks, lady!

569
00:40:54.496 --> 00:40:56.707
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm working on it.

570
00:41:26.111 --> 00:41:28.113
I'm not a Diesel, you're a Diesel.

571
00:41:55.641 --> 00:41:57.935
-There's another body here.
-Of course there is.

572
00:41:58.018 --> 00:42:00.479
Not my fault, and I believe
it's the son of the White Death.

573
00:42:00.562 --> 00:42:01.563
Did the Twins ID you?

574
00:42:01.647 --> 00:42:03.690
Did you hear what I said?
White Death. Death. Death.

575
00:42:05.025 --> 00:42:06.443
Snatch-and-grab, my ass.

576
00:42:06.527 --> 00:42:08.862
There's someone else
doing a job on this train.

577
00:42:08.946 --> 00:42:10.322
The Twins. We know that.

578
00:42:10.405 --> 00:42:11.907
Again, not twins.

579
00:42:11.990 --> 00:42:13.867
Loonies, but not twins.

580
00:42:14.826 --> 00:42:18.622
They're here for the kid,
but somebody killed the kid.

581
00:42:22.668 --> 00:42:24.503
-The guy with the knife.
-The Wolf.

582
00:42:26.421 --> 00:42:28.507
He said he came here for revenge.

583
00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:31.510
He just happened to run into me,
because of course he did.

584
00:42:32.803 --> 00:42:34.137
Now, get this.

585
00:42:34.596 --> 00:42:38.433
The kid was poisoned in the same way
as El Sbarro was at the wedding.

586
00:42:38.517 --> 00:42:40.060
It's El Saguaro.

587
00:42:40.143 --> 00:42:41.562
-The same killer?
-Yeah.

588
00:42:43.981 --> 00:42:45.274
I'm like MacGyver.

589
00:42:48.318 --> 00:42:49.194
Fuck!

590
00:42:55.492 --> 00:42:59.913
All of Japan is in terror
because a poisonous snake was stolen.

591
00:42:59.997 --> 00:43:04.376
Boomslang snakes
have a very strong poison.

592
00:43:04.459 --> 00:43:07.045
When they bite,
it can cause internal bleeding...

593
00:43:07.129 --> 00:43:09.464
and bleeding from holes in the body.

594
00:43:09.590 --> 00:43:10.799
Oh, shit.

595
00:43:10.883 --> 00:43:12.092
What are you doing?

596
00:43:13.844 --> 00:43:15.053
What's wrong?

597
00:43:15.137 --> 00:43:16.263
Fuck this, man.

598
00:43:17.222 --> 00:43:18.348
Fuck Carver.

599
00:43:21.185 --> 00:43:22.352
Shit.

600
00:43:23.729 --> 00:43:25.731
Oh, thank God. For a minute there....

601
00:43:25.814 --> 00:43:27.983
Jesus Christ,
you had a bit of a bosh, pal.

602
00:43:29.484 --> 00:43:32.404
All right. Five stations to Kyoto.

603
00:43:32.946 --> 00:43:34.364
Better get tickety-boo.

604
00:43:38.202 --> 00:43:40.954
Would you describe me
as someone who lives in perpetual anxiety?

605
00:43:41.038 --> 00:43:42.080
No, no.

606
00:43:42.164 --> 00:43:43.165
Ah, fucknuts.

607
00:43:43.248 --> 00:43:44.917
And if it wasn't clear, I meant "yes."

608
00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:48.045
-The conductor, I don't have a ticket.
-Not sure that's your biggest concern.

609
00:43:48.170 --> 00:43:50.214
You don't understand,
this guy's like Criss-fuckin'-Angel.

610
00:43:50.297 --> 00:43:51.757
He pops up everywhere.

611
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:54.843
He slows me down,
Tangerine catches me, I am dead.

612
00:43:55.344 --> 00:43:57.012
Dead. Dead.

613
00:43:59.014 --> 00:43:59.932
Hold on.

614
00:44:04.561 --> 00:44:05.854
Hey, bro.

615
00:44:08.273 --> 00:44:09.358
Wanna make an easy 200 bucks?

616
00:44:14.071 --> 00:44:16.156
Is this like a...sex thing?

617
00:44:20.327 --> 00:44:21.161
Nope.

618
00:44:21.787 --> 00:44:23.372
Oh, okay. I was kidding.

619
00:44:23.455 --> 00:44:25.123
Yeah, what's up?
What do you need, bro?

620
00:45:06.582 --> 00:45:08.125
All right, game's up, big boy.

621
00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:10.210
Where is the case?

622
00:45:10.794 --> 00:45:13.213
Tell me, and I promise
I'll only shoot you enough--

623
00:45:13.297 --> 00:45:16.550
Whoa, whoa, is this the sex stuff?

624
00:45:20.095 --> 00:45:21.138
Twat!

625
00:45:21.972 --> 00:45:24.558
-Shit.
-I do love an accent.

626
00:45:31.648 --> 00:45:32.774
Come on.

627
00:45:40.115 --> 00:45:41.200
Oops.

628
00:45:43.660 --> 00:45:44.995
Picture it.

629
00:45:45.746 --> 00:45:46.997
Picture what?

630
00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.249
Well, the man. Watching your son.

631
00:45:50.459 --> 00:45:51.502
I wonder how he'll do it.

632
00:45:53.253 --> 00:45:56.215
Maybe a pillow to the face.

633
00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:58.467
Or maybe something clever.

634
00:45:59.218 --> 00:46:01.178
Like an air bubble in the IV.

635
00:46:04.556 --> 00:46:06.058
No, no. You hold onto it.

636
00:46:06.642 --> 00:46:08.977
The innocent young girl act
doesn't really get you very far

637
00:46:09.061 --> 00:46:10.646
if you're holding a loaded gun.

638
00:46:16.944 --> 00:46:18.153
Put it on speaker.

639
00:46:20.364 --> 00:46:21.740
-Father.
-Yuichi?

640
00:46:21.823 --> 00:46:24.993
Why did you leave the hospital?

641
00:46:26.787 --> 00:46:28.038
Be honest.

642
00:46:29.039 --> 00:46:30.666
Who's there with you?

643
00:46:32.334 --> 00:46:36.588
I found out who pushed Wataru
off that roof.

644
00:46:37.464 --> 00:46:39.174
Did you go to the authorities?

645
00:46:40.509 --> 00:46:41.927
I wanted to handle it myself.

646
00:46:45.514 --> 00:46:47.015
My son.

647
00:46:47.099 --> 00:46:50.269
You can't control
what fate has in store for us.

648
00:46:50.894 --> 00:46:51.854
Father.

649
00:46:53.063 --> 00:46:54.064
I'm sorry.

650
00:46:57.025 --> 00:46:58.235
We're not finished.

651
00:46:58.318 --> 00:47:01.989
You're going to sit here and you're going
to go through every combination

652
00:47:02.114 --> 00:47:03.657
until you open up that case.

653
00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:06.869
-Kid, that could take f--
-No, no. It won't.

654
00:47:07.619 --> 00:47:09.913
I'd start with the low numbers.
Just a thought.

655
00:47:25.554 --> 00:47:27.181
Fuck me!

656
00:47:29.016 --> 00:47:30.642
-There he is.
-He got by me.

657
00:47:30.726 --> 00:47:32.394
Yeah. Yeah, me, too.

658
00:47:34.313 --> 00:47:35.606
I guess our best option now

659
00:47:35.689 --> 00:47:38.317
is bring the White Death
the man who killed his son.

660
00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.402
-But Glasses didn't do it.
-I could give a rat's ass.

661
00:47:40.485 --> 00:47:42.362
No, I'm telling you, I read him.
He's not the type, mate.

662
00:47:42.446 --> 00:47:44.156
I'll tell you what, do you like your arms?

663
00:47:44.239 --> 00:47:45.365
-You know I like my arms.
-Well, then

664
00:47:45.449 --> 00:47:47.451
someone's got to take the blame,
don't they?

665
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:51.205
-That's you or me?
-You or me?

666
00:47:52.664 --> 00:47:55.125
Shit, that asshole stole my phone.

667
00:47:55.250 --> 00:47:56.293
And my gun, Lucille.

668
00:47:56.376 --> 00:47:58.587
-Oh, come on.
-That's my favorite gun. Son of a bitch.

669
00:47:58.670 --> 00:47:59.671
Fuck about.

670
00:48:00.714 --> 00:48:03.008
-Right, what?
-Step off the train at the next stop

671
00:48:03.091 --> 00:48:05.469
-with the briefcase and the son.
-Hang on a minute, didn't we say Kyoto?

672
00:48:05.552 --> 00:48:06.970
You will still depart at Kyoto.

673
00:48:07.054 --> 00:48:09.681
The White Death wants to make sure
you are being honest about situation.

674
00:48:09.765 --> 00:48:11.517
Well, this is a complete waste of our t--

675
00:48:12.476 --> 00:48:15.812
All right, all right. We just have
to prove we have a case we don't have

676
00:48:15.896 --> 00:48:18.065
and a live son instead of a dead one.

677
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:20.817
What are you thinking?

678
00:48:22.611 --> 00:48:24.446
-The ol' Punch and Judy?
-The ol' Punch and Judy.

679
00:49:07.114 --> 00:49:09.157
You were all told to exit the train.

680
00:49:09.283 --> 00:49:11.994
Yeah? Well, unlike you,
I'm a professional.

681
00:49:12.077 --> 00:49:14.746
I wanted to make sure it weren't
some Yakuza trap, but clearly not.

682
00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.707
It's some fuckin''80s dance-off, innit?

683
00:49:18.166 --> 00:49:20.169
Where is your twin? Tangerine?

684
00:49:20.252 --> 00:49:21.253
I'm Tangerine.

685
00:49:21.962 --> 00:49:23.589
Lemon's keepin' the case safe.

686
00:49:23.672 --> 00:49:24.840
And the White Death's son?

687
00:49:25.632 --> 00:49:27.301
Yeah, he's there.

688
00:49:29.636 --> 00:49:31.680
Wave to your fuckin' fans, princess.

689
00:49:33.098 --> 00:49:35.434
He's a fuckin' happy chappy, isn't he?

690
00:49:35.517 --> 00:49:38.937
But I've gotta pop on the train,
you know, ten seconds left, so ta-ra.

691
00:49:39.688 --> 00:49:42.566
We'll stick to the plan,
depart in Kyoto.

692
00:49:42.691 --> 00:49:46.111
Do us a favor:
Get the fuck off my back, will ya?

693
00:49:55.495 --> 00:49:56.413
Okay.

694
00:49:58.457 --> 00:49:59.374
Okay.

695
00:49:59.458 --> 00:50:00.626
Whoa!

696
00:50:03.962 --> 00:50:04.963
Okay.

697
00:50:06.965 --> 00:50:07.841
Okay.

698
00:50:09.885 --> 00:50:12.554
-That couldn't have gone better.
-Yeah, let's hope they buy it.

699
00:50:12.638 --> 00:50:15.724
We need to find that Glasses twat,
like, right to the fuck now.

700
00:50:17.893 --> 00:50:20.312
I'm gonna go up, you go down,
double back when you're done.

701
00:50:20.395 --> 00:50:22.147
If you see him,
fucking deal with him, yeah?

702
00:50:22.272 --> 00:50:23.524
Yeah.

703
00:50:26.443 --> 00:50:28.070
-Up is...?
-That way. Towards Tokyo.

704
00:50:28.153 --> 00:50:29.947
Departing trains
are always moving down.

705
00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.198
And, look, be careful.

706
00:50:31.949 --> 00:50:33.909
-Something else is going on here.
-Yeah.

707
00:50:33.992 --> 00:50:36.328
Yeah, I still feel like
there's a Diesel lurking about.

708
00:50:36.954 --> 00:50:40.207
I swear to God, what did I say?
What did I say?

709
00:50:40.290 --> 00:50:42.793
-I said I'll fucking--
-Shoot me in the face. Yeah.

710
00:50:42.876 --> 00:50:45.462
Thomas still taught me how
to see people, read them for real.

711
00:50:45.546 --> 00:50:46.755
Yeah.

712
00:50:46.839 --> 00:50:48.757
-And I'm never wrong, am I?
-No.

713
00:50:48.841 --> 00:50:50.884
Glasses, he is not our guy.

714
00:50:52.177 --> 00:50:53.220
Okay.

715
00:50:56.890 --> 00:50:59.685
You shoot first
and come up with the answers later.

716
00:51:04.231 --> 00:51:05.190
I always do.

717
00:51:08.151 --> 00:51:09.236
And, Lemon?

718
00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.904
Yeah, man?

719
00:51:12.406 --> 00:51:13.657
You be careful, too.

720
00:51:17.619 --> 00:51:20.497
I mean, when this train's a-rockin'
don't come a-knockin', right?

721
00:52:08.295 --> 00:52:11.173
Seven more minutes
and I am off this train.

722
00:52:11.256 --> 00:52:12.508
Are you hiding in the bathroom?

723
00:52:12.591 --> 00:52:15.511
Yeah. Have you tried
these smart toilets?

724
00:52:15.594 --> 00:52:18.096
They're a pleasure to the senses.

725
00:52:18.597 --> 00:52:21.892
If I had one in the chamber
I would rock this bad boy right now.

726
00:52:21.975 --> 00:52:24.019
Boundaries. We need boundaries.

727
00:52:31.443 --> 00:52:32.694
Holy shit.

728
00:52:36.657 --> 00:52:38.242
Holy shit.

729
00:52:45.958 --> 00:52:47.209
Whoa there.

730
00:52:48.627 --> 00:52:50.420
Oh, look at that.

731
00:52:50.504 --> 00:52:52.840
I knew my luck would rub off on you.

732
00:52:54.842 --> 00:52:55.884
Fuck.

733
00:53:06.895 --> 00:53:08.397
What the fuck are you doing?

734
00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:12.234
I am doing the same thing
that I did to the gun in your hand.

735
00:53:16.864 --> 00:53:18.866
I'm just making things interesting.

736
00:53:18.949 --> 00:53:20.701
I'm hedging my bets, you could say.

737
00:53:20.784 --> 00:53:21.952
Fuck.

738
00:53:22.035 --> 00:53:24.621
If the gun doesn't kill him,
the case will.

739
00:53:24.746 --> 00:53:27.165
This thing could have
blown up in my hand at any point.

740
00:53:27.958 --> 00:53:31.044
No, no. It's inert unless you fire it.

741
00:53:31.628 --> 00:53:33.630
But don't fire it,
you know what I mean?

742
00:53:34.381 --> 00:53:38.343
Unlike what I put in this briefcase here.
This is very....

743
00:53:40.137 --> 00:53:42.764
Well, this is not inert at all.
This is....

744
00:53:45.976 --> 00:53:50.230
Did you know that there have been
31 attempts on the White Death's life

745
00:53:50.314 --> 00:53:52.232
from within his own organization?

746
00:53:52.900 --> 00:53:56.278
Each one,
he executed with their own weapon.

747
00:53:57.738 --> 00:53:59.239
Do you see what I'm getting at here?

748
00:54:00.949 --> 00:54:02.868
Kimura, I brought you here to fail.

749
00:54:03.952 --> 00:54:05.954
You push my son off a roof...

750
00:54:06.038 --> 00:54:08.081
-Right.
-...bring me to this train...

751
00:54:08.999 --> 00:54:10.709
frame me as an assassin

752
00:54:11.335 --> 00:54:14.338
here to kill the White Death,
and use my gun...

753
00:54:15.339 --> 00:54:17.508
that will blow up in his face?

754
00:54:17.591 --> 00:54:19.051
Very good.

755
00:54:19.635 --> 00:54:21.512
Very, very good.

756
00:54:21.595 --> 00:54:23.430
It's a stupid plan.

757
00:54:24.264 --> 00:54:25.432
It is...

758
00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:28.227
a brilliant plan.

759
00:54:35.692 --> 00:54:37.069
Occupied.

760
00:54:38.445 --> 00:54:41.281
You remember that mob surgeon
that died mid-heart operation?

761
00:54:42.032 --> 00:54:44.910
-Yeah, he had a stroke, right?
-No, that was the official cover.

762
00:54:45.035 --> 00:54:47.704
He was poisoned. The assassin
goes by the name of the Hornet.

763
00:54:49.122 --> 00:54:50.249
Oh, my God!

764
00:54:53.126 --> 00:54:54.795
He used boomslang snake venom.

765
00:54:54.878 --> 00:54:58.131
It congeals the blood,
making you bleed out of every orifice.

766
00:54:58.215 --> 00:55:01.260
If the antidote isn't administered
within 30 seconds, you're dead.

767
00:55:01.885 --> 00:55:04.721
Fun fact:
The same poison that was used on--

768
00:55:04.847 --> 00:55:05.764
El Sagardo.

769
00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:08.517
It's El Saguaro.

770
00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:10.769
What is the Hornet doing on this train?

771
00:55:10.853 --> 00:55:14.439
Well, whatever deal was made, it wasn't
done through the normal channels.

772
00:55:14.523 --> 00:55:16.024
There's something else going on here.

773
00:55:16.567 --> 00:55:18.944
-How long are you going to be?
-It's still occupied, lady.

774
00:55:21.196 --> 00:55:22.406
and $#%*

775
00:55:22.489 --> 00:55:24.449
The Wolf must have
figured out who the Hornet is,

776
00:55:24.533 --> 00:55:28.161
came here for revenge for his wife,
his boss, came here to whack the Hornet.

777
00:55:28.245 --> 00:55:29.872
Oh, my God, did you just say "whack"?

778
00:55:29.955 --> 00:55:32.499
-I did, I'm bringing it back.
-No, it needs to stay where it was.

779
00:55:32.583 --> 00:55:34.042
If I can figure out who the Hornet is,

780
00:55:34.126 --> 00:55:36.920
I can give him to Lemon and Tangerine
so they don't whack me.

781
00:55:37.004 --> 00:55:39.131
-Really?
-You see what I did there?

782
00:55:39.256 --> 00:55:40.799
You're really proud of yourself,
aren't you?

783
00:55:41.633 --> 00:55:44.303
Jeez, they're usually so polite here.

784
00:55:44.386 --> 00:55:46.346
Lady, I'm so--

785
00:55:48.265 --> 00:55:50.350
Oh. That's cool.

786
00:55:53.312 --> 00:55:54.313
Bastard!

787
00:55:57.107 --> 00:56:00.235
Come here, you dirty fucking scum!

788
00:56:24.426 --> 00:56:26.720
Wait, wait, wait.
I know who killed the kid.

789
00:56:26.803 --> 00:56:29.515
I couldn't give a rat's ass.
Where's my fucking case?

790
00:56:42.528 --> 00:56:43.445
Yeah.

791
00:56:53.664 --> 00:56:55.582
Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

792
00:57:04.216 --> 00:57:06.134
Oh, no, thank you. We're okay.

793
00:57:06.218 --> 00:57:09.054
Oh, I would love a bottle of water.

794
00:57:11.974 --> 00:57:15.936
You know what? Do you have
anything sparkling? With bubbles?

795
00:57:20.524 --> 00:57:21.817
That's the one. Thank--

796
00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.570
Yeah.

797
00:57:24.653 --> 00:57:25.529
Oh, yeah.

798
00:57:27.072 --> 00:57:31.243
Bro, I just remembered I gave all my money
to that guy to wear my hat and glasses.

799
00:57:31.326 --> 00:57:32.619
Could you?

800
00:57:39.668 --> 00:57:41.336
How much for the bottle of water, love?

801
00:57:45.215 --> 00:57:47.718
Oh, there. No, you're welcome. Yeah.

802
00:57:48.427 --> 00:57:51.138
A thousand yen. That's ten quid
for that bottle of water, mate.

803
00:57:54.224 --> 00:57:55.058
Ta-ra.

804
00:58:03.317 --> 00:58:06.111
-You sure you don't wanna talk this out?
-Not particularly, no.

805
00:58:06.195 --> 00:58:07.321
Okay.

806
00:58:10.991 --> 00:58:14.119
You fucking bastard!
Fucker! Come here, you little fuck!

807
00:58:25.547 --> 00:58:28.050
I know who killed the kid.

808
00:58:28.175 --> 00:58:30.010
Yeah? Where the fuck is he, then?

809
00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:32.596
He's on this train.

810
00:58:32.679 --> 00:58:34.640
Well, that narrows it down, then,
don't it?

811
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.396
Let go! Get off!

812
00:59:09.925 --> 00:59:10.843
You gonna get that?

813
00:59:11.885 --> 00:59:12.886
No.

814
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:15.597
You probably oughta get that.

815
00:59:20.310 --> 00:59:21.562
It could be important.

816
00:59:24.189 --> 00:59:26.149
Okay, maybe it's important.

817
00:59:26.233 --> 00:59:28.151
Fucking hell. Come here.

818
00:59:29.695 --> 00:59:30.529
Yeah, what do you want?

819
00:59:30.612 --> 00:59:33.156
The White Death says to get off
at next stop holding the briefcase

820
00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:35.033
or he will kill everyone on that train.

821
00:59:35.117 --> 00:59:38.871
Okay, yeah, I can make it, but Lemon,
he's a little tied up right now.

822
00:59:39.413 --> 00:59:43.083
Both of you this time. With the case.
Or everyone dies.

823
00:59:45.502 --> 00:59:47.337
Fuckin' paranoid, this lot.

824
00:59:47.462 --> 00:59:48.922
You don't happen to have the case
on you, do ya?

825
00:59:49.006 --> 00:59:50.090
No.

826
00:59:52.467 --> 00:59:54.845
Yeah, I don't think
I'd reach Lemon in time anyway.

827
00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:56.597
You still got his phone.

828
00:59:57.181 --> 00:59:58.348
Do you have a gun on ya?

829
01:00:01.268 --> 01:00:03.228
-Don't like 'em.
-Well....

830
01:00:04.771 --> 01:00:06.190
Game's up, mate.

831
01:00:06.273 --> 01:00:08.609
For what it's worth,
you seem like a right fucking asshole

832
01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:10.777
and I'm glad
you're gonna fucking die with me.

833
01:00:10.861 --> 01:00:11.904
That's nice.

834
01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:16.450
-Just curious.
-Yeah?

835
01:00:17.242 --> 01:00:19.036
Do they even know
what Lemon looks like?

836
01:00:19.745 --> 01:00:20.871
Wow.

837
01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:24.291
You two do look like twins, huh?

838
01:00:26.293 --> 01:00:28.545
Yeah, okay. We got the case, now what?

839
01:00:28.629 --> 01:00:31.089
You still take the train to Kyoto Station.

840
01:00:32.674 --> 01:00:34.885
Yeah. Okay. We can do that. Wonderful.

841
01:00:34.968 --> 01:00:35.886
Hey.

842
01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:39.264
-Have you opened the case?
-No, of course not.

843
01:00:39.348 --> 01:00:41.475
I never asked for the combination,
you know what I mean?

844
01:00:41.558 --> 01:00:42.726
Keep it safe that way.

845
01:00:44.186 --> 01:00:45.812
So no one gets greedy.

846
01:01:03.247 --> 01:01:06.834
I know, I know.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

847
01:01:06.917 --> 01:01:09.461
-I have this bad luck thing.
-Is that what you call it?

848
01:01:09.545 --> 01:01:10.963
I hit the thing and it went:

849
01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:14.424
-Why did you even bother trying?
-I was trying to sell it.

850
01:01:14.508 --> 01:01:15.926
Well, I don't think
they were in the market

851
01:01:16.051 --> 01:01:18.345
for fucking dildos and pantyhose,
were they?

852
01:01:18.428 --> 01:01:19.972
But they were buying it.

853
01:01:20.973 --> 01:01:21.890
I had 'em.

854
01:01:24.935 --> 01:01:27.813
You proved you're smarter
than everyone. You've won, kid.

855
01:01:28.730 --> 01:01:29.731
Please.

856
01:01:31.525 --> 01:01:32.651
Please, kid.

857
01:01:34.152 --> 01:01:35.153
Call your man.

858
01:01:36.321 --> 01:01:38.240
I'll do what you want.

859
01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:41.493
Just leave my son alone.

860
01:01:43.036 --> 01:01:43.912
Your son.

861
01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:48.959
Do you know how easy it was
to get him to follow me up onto that roof?

862
01:01:51.128 --> 01:01:53.172
Didn't think
it would take you three hours

863
01:01:53.255 --> 01:01:56.925
to even realize your son was missing.

864
01:01:57.426 --> 01:01:59.178
You're a terrible father,

865
01:01:59.261 --> 01:02:01.722
and your son is going to pay

866
01:02:01.805 --> 01:02:03.765
for all the mistakes that you've made.

867
01:02:04.474 --> 01:02:08.061
You don't know anything about life.

868
01:02:09.688 --> 01:02:11.148
How hard it is.

869
01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:13.817
You're just...

870
01:02:14.568 --> 01:02:15.986
some spoiled girl

871
01:02:16.778 --> 01:02:18.197
who breaks their toys

872
01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:21.116
when Mommy says she has to pick up.

873
01:02:21.867 --> 01:02:26.371
Sorry. Pardon me, I don't mean
to interrupt what's going on here.

874
01:02:26.455 --> 01:02:28.165
But you wouldn't happen to have seen

875
01:02:28.248 --> 01:02:31.251
a tiny white prick with a pair of glasses
come through here, have you?

876
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:35.464
No.

877
01:02:35.547 --> 01:02:38.509
What about a silver case with a train
sticker by the handle? You seen that?

878
01:02:38.592 --> 01:02:40.260
It's not ringing any--

879
01:02:40.344 --> 01:02:43.931
Uncle Kimura, have you seen
a silver briefcase with the train--

880
01:02:44.014 --> 01:02:46.266
Did you say
"train sticker by the handle"?

881
01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:48.227
-The handle had a train sticker.
-That's unique.

882
01:02:48.310 --> 01:02:51.063
No, I haven't seen anything like that.
I think I'd remember.

883
01:02:53.106 --> 01:02:54.149
"Uncle Kimura"?

884
01:02:54.816 --> 01:02:57.611
-Yeah.
-Right. Are you okay? That's....

885
01:02:57.694 --> 01:03:00.656
Oh, yeah. Never shave on a bullet train,
you know what they say.

886
01:03:00.739 --> 01:03:04.409
Well, couldn't hurt to ask, you know?
I'm just gonna keep following him.

887
01:03:04.535 --> 01:03:06.119
Pardon me, "Uncle Kimura."

888
01:03:06.203 --> 01:03:07.371
You guys take care.

889
01:03:07.996 --> 01:03:09.289
Just one thing, though.

890
01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:14.336
Most people assume "suitcase,"
you know, 'cause it's a train,

891
01:03:14.419 --> 01:03:15.629
overnight and all.

892
01:03:16.463 --> 01:03:17.381
But you....

893
01:03:18.131 --> 01:03:19.341
You said "briefcase."

894
01:03:20.259 --> 01:03:21.718
I never said "briefcase."

895
01:03:22.678 --> 01:03:23.720
I think...

896
01:03:25.055 --> 01:03:26.640
I found my Diesel.

897
01:03:32.145 --> 01:03:33.897
You know what's waiting for us in Kyoto.

898
01:03:35.899 --> 01:03:38.068
We should just get off this train. Now.

899
01:03:38.694 --> 01:03:41.280
If you think I'm stepping off this train
without Lemon or the case,

900
01:03:41.363 --> 01:03:42.322
you must be mistaken.

901
01:03:42.406 --> 01:03:44.783
Okay. Well, the case is
in the first-class lounge.

902
01:03:44.867 --> 01:03:48.161
It's behind the bar.
It's in a trash can. It's yours.

903
01:03:48.287 --> 01:03:50.038
Me, I'm getting off.

904
01:03:50.122 --> 01:03:52.374
I'm gonna go find a temple
and reevaluate my choices or something.

905
01:03:52.499 --> 01:03:54.835
Ooh, that sounds very lovely,
but here's the deal.

906
01:03:54.918 --> 01:03:56.628
I still need a fall guy.

907
01:03:57.421 --> 01:03:58.547
Shit.

908
01:03:59.965 --> 01:04:01.216
-You need a fall guy.
-Yeah.

909
01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:03.343
No, I understand. I get it.

910
01:04:05.679 --> 01:04:07.639
It's a bit of a conundrum,
'cause I'm thinking,

911
01:04:07.723 --> 01:04:09.308
"Do I hand him back in one piece"

912
01:04:09.391 --> 01:04:12.686
or do I chop you up into little pieces
and stuff you inside a fucking Momomon.

913
01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:14.813
That's what's
going through my head right now.

914
01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:17.691
Or....

915
01:04:17.774 --> 01:04:19.443
Or what? You got a better idea, do ya?

916
01:04:20.194 --> 01:04:22.446
You know, before us now is just a wall,

917
01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:24.781
but it's an illusion, man,
it's a construct.

918
01:04:24.865 --> 01:04:27.492
You know,
'cause within that wall sits a window.

919
01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:29.161
A window of opportunity.

920
01:04:29.786 --> 01:04:30.829
Damn it. It's a door.

921
01:04:32.331 --> 01:04:34.416
Within that wall is a door.

922
01:04:34.499 --> 01:04:36.793
I'm finding it very hard
to follow this story.

923
01:04:36.877 --> 01:04:38.795
My point is, that door is closing.

924
01:04:52.851 --> 01:04:54.061
Now the only question is:

925
01:04:54.144 --> 01:04:56.188
Which one is the Diesel,
which one is the Duck?

926
01:04:56.271 --> 01:04:57.356
"The Duck"?

927
01:04:57.439 --> 01:05:00.025
It's a kid's show.
Thomas the Train Engine.

928
01:05:00.108 --> 01:05:02.736
Close. Thomas the Tank Engine.

929
01:05:02.819 --> 01:05:03.987
Please, mister.

930
01:05:04.530 --> 01:05:06.657
This man, he kidnapped me,

931
01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:09.826
and he said that he's going
to hold me for ransom.

932
01:05:12.246 --> 01:05:14.831
I'm sorry.
I get captivated by white-girl tears.

933
01:05:14.915 --> 01:05:15.707
Bravo.

934
01:05:15.791 --> 01:05:19.253
Common sense tells me that this old,
shaky geezer here is the one in charge,

935
01:05:19.336 --> 01:05:20.879
but I'm really good at reading people

936
01:05:20.963 --> 01:05:23.549
and something tells me
that you are just not fucking right.

937
01:05:26.593 --> 01:05:30.931
So... let's see here.
I mean, I can't shoot you both.

938
01:05:32.599 --> 01:05:33.934
Then I get no answers.

939
01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:38.146
How about this? I'm sure you'll love this.
We're gonna play a little game.

940
01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:40.524
If you wanna play a game,
put both your hands up.

941
01:05:40.607 --> 01:05:42.234
Perfect. I knew you would like this.

942
01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:45.237
You're gonna close your eyes,
and I'm gonna count to three.

943
01:05:45.779 --> 01:05:47.447
Whichever one is in charge,
raise your hand.

944
01:05:47.531 --> 01:05:49.491
Whichever one isn't,
you point at the one who is.

945
01:05:49.575 --> 01:05:51.994
Now if you both raise your hands
or you both point at each other,

946
01:05:52.077 --> 01:05:53.912
I know you're both liars,
and the truth ain't in ya.

947
01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:55.914
And then I'll fucking shoot you both.
Ready?

948
01:05:55.998 --> 01:05:59.042
You said you couldn't kill us both.
You'd get no answers.

949
01:05:59.126 --> 01:06:01.295
-I did say that. Didn't I?
-Yes.

950
01:06:02.504 --> 01:06:05.424
Sometimes you gotta shoot first
and come up with answers later.

951
01:06:06.049 --> 01:06:07.217
One.

952
01:06:08.135 --> 01:06:09.761
Or if I don't answer
this phone when you call...

953
01:06:09.845 --> 01:06:12.514
Two. Three.
...kill Wataru.

954
01:06:40.709 --> 01:06:42.252
Am I dreaming?

955
01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:14.034
Sorry, mate. Not your lucky day.

956
01:07:20.749 --> 01:07:22.334
I have a wire in my bag,

957
01:07:22.417 --> 01:07:26.421
and I think that we could use it
to lock the door from the outside.

958
01:07:28.006 --> 01:07:29.383
It was so scary.

959
01:07:29.466 --> 01:07:33.846
He said that if I didn't do what he said,
or if I yelled or anything,

960
01:07:33.929 --> 01:07:35.973
that he would do
awful, awful things to me.

961
01:07:36.056 --> 01:07:37.766
Then why didn't you use this, then?

962
01:07:41.895 --> 01:07:45.566
Yeah, he kidnapped ya
and gave you his gun to hold, right?

963
01:07:45.649 --> 01:07:46.817
-No, no, no.
-Easy.

964
01:07:47.568 --> 01:07:50.863
Please. I don't know how to use a gun.
I don't know. Please.

965
01:07:50.946 --> 01:07:52.573
Fuck me. You are fucking....

966
01:07:52.656 --> 01:07:55.033
You are really good.
You sure you didn't study?

967
01:07:55.117 --> 01:07:57.119
You're not even afraid
and your lip's quivering.

968
01:07:57.202 --> 01:07:59.830
That's a tear.
That is really authentic, mate.

969
01:07:59.913 --> 01:08:00.831
You're the Diesel.

970
01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:03.041
-I gotta kill ya.
-Please.

971
01:08:03.125 --> 01:08:04.334
I'm just a kid. Please.

972
01:08:04.418 --> 01:08:07.296
How do you do that?!
It's really unbelievable!

973
01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:08.463
Please. Please.

974
01:08:17.222 --> 01:08:18.140
I got....

975
01:08:19.641 --> 01:08:21.560
It's fucking-- You stay right there.

976
01:08:22.269 --> 01:08:24.354
Did you--? What the fuck is happening?

977
01:08:26.273 --> 01:08:27.566
Everyone loves lemons.

978
01:08:37.284 --> 01:08:38.785
Fucking die!

979
01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:53.300
I'm glad you enjoyed the performance.

980
01:08:54.593 --> 01:08:56.178
How did you do that?

981
01:08:57.387 --> 01:08:58.805
I'm not sure.

982
01:08:58.889 --> 01:09:00.599
Just lucky, I guess.

983
01:09:02.601 --> 01:09:05.687
Tell Tangerine.... Tell Tangerine....

984
01:09:07.606 --> 01:09:08.690
Tangerine....

985
01:09:09.650 --> 01:09:10.609
He's Gordon.

986
01:09:11.151 --> 01:09:13.237
Tangerine is Gordon.

987
01:09:20.035 --> 01:09:24.081
Getting off this train.
I'm getting that case, and that's it.

988
01:09:32.214 --> 01:09:33.048
Hello?

989
01:09:33.757 --> 01:09:34.633
Yuichi.

990
01:09:37.511 --> 01:09:40.347
It looks like Yuichi lost his phone
on the bullet train.

991
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:42.182
You can pick it up
at Kyoto Station, though.

992
01:09:42.266 --> 01:09:44.101
-Kyoto?
-There's this Find My Phone app.

993
01:09:46.061 --> 01:09:47.187
Surprisingly accurate.

994
01:09:47.271 --> 01:09:48.313
Bye.

995
01:10:07.249 --> 01:10:09.168
God, he's got a great walk.

996
01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:18.385
Mr. Wolf.

997
01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:21.138
So you came to kill the Hornet.

998
01:10:29.521 --> 01:10:30.772
What happened?

999
01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:35.736
Are you okay?

1000
01:10:39.406 --> 01:10:40.741
Fuck, that thing is hot.

1001
01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:50.834
Momomomo. Momomon. Momon. Momomon.

1002
01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:06.767
The pastry chef.

1003
01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:20.405
You stole my snake, bitch.

1004
01:11:22.324 --> 01:11:25.369
That was your--? We should really
call the authorities 'cause someone--

1005
01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.544
Take that, punk!

1006
01:11:35.629 --> 01:11:39.383
Hey, bitch. One little prick from this,
you know what happens?

1007
01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:42.386
-Yes.
-Your blood congeals, clogging your veins.

1008
01:11:42.469 --> 01:11:45.264
-You bleed out of your fucking eye socket.
-I said yes!

1009
01:11:46.765 --> 01:11:48.475
Weak-ass bitch.

1010
01:11:50.352 --> 01:11:51.937
-Stop!
-I'm taking that case.

1011
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:53.146
Give it!

1012
01:11:53.939 --> 01:11:55.399
I was promised my money.

1013
01:11:56.024 --> 01:11:58.569
-By who?
-Don't know. It was all online.

1014
01:11:58.652 --> 01:12:00.571
They said my money was in the case.

1015
01:12:01.530 --> 01:12:04.491
What? Someone paid you to have
the kid killed with his own ransom?

1016
01:12:04.616 --> 01:12:06.076
Wow. That's dark.

1017
01:12:06.159 --> 01:12:08.078
That is dark as-- Stop!

1018
01:12:12.332 --> 01:12:13.917
The Hornet stings, bitch!

1019
01:12:14.585 --> 01:12:16.461
Lady, you can have the case.

1020
01:12:16.545 --> 01:12:18.881
Oh, but you've seen my face, bitch.

1021
01:12:30.434 --> 01:12:32.811
Thirty seconds
before the venom does its thing.

1022
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:52.706
You bitch.

1023
01:12:52.789 --> 01:12:55.959
Oh, shit, man. Do you have a backup?

1024
01:12:56.043 --> 01:12:58.170
What do you think, bitch?

1025
01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:02.049
Oh, shit, man.

1026
01:13:03.967 --> 01:13:05.427
You don't have another one?

1027
01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:07.346
You gotta be better prepared.

1028
01:13:07.429 --> 01:13:10.224
I'm mansplaining,
I'm mansplaining again. I'm sorry.

1029
01:13:12.142 --> 01:13:14.102
Can I get you something?

1030
01:13:20.192 --> 01:13:22.402
You don't seem like a religious person.

1031
01:13:24.488 --> 01:13:26.823
Water? Would you like some water?

1032
01:13:28.033 --> 01:13:29.117
No?

1033
01:13:29.910 --> 01:13:31.495
You want a blanket?

1034
01:13:31.578 --> 01:13:33.497
You want me to hold your hand?

1035
01:13:44.091 --> 01:13:45.759
Karma is a bitch.

1036
01:16:01.728 --> 01:16:02.646
Talk to me.

1037
01:16:03.730 --> 01:16:05.607
It's my bad luck.
It's bad luck on acid.

1038
01:16:05.691 --> 01:16:07.651
I gotta get off this train.

1039
01:16:07.734 --> 01:16:09.069
Do you have the case?

1040
01:16:10.237 --> 01:16:11.113
Yes.

1041
01:16:11.864 --> 01:16:13.991
Are you lying on the ground
in the fetal position?

1042
01:16:16.034 --> 01:16:17.411
I'm not on the ground.

1043
01:16:17.494 --> 01:16:18.745
You need to get up.

1044
01:16:18.829 --> 01:16:21.790
-How do you always know what I'm doing?
-Because I know you.

1045
01:16:21.874 --> 01:16:23.500
I could journal. I should journal.

1046
01:16:23.584 --> 01:16:27.212
Ladybug. Ladybug. Breathe. Deep breaths.

1047
01:16:27.296 --> 01:16:30.007
We're almost there.
You just need to get up.

1048
01:16:30.883 --> 01:16:31.800
Right.

1049
01:16:51.862 --> 01:16:54.489
You have been lying to me, my friend.

1050
01:16:56.158 --> 01:16:58.452
Well, cat's out of the bag now, innit?

1051
01:16:58.535 --> 01:17:01.788
You were responsible
for keeping my son safe,

1052
01:17:01.872 --> 01:17:03.290
for keeping my money safe.

1053
01:17:03.373 --> 01:17:05.667
I don't know a thing or two
about being a parent.

1054
01:17:05.751 --> 01:17:07.085
But you know what I would do,

1055
01:17:07.586 --> 01:17:10.297
being that it's your son
and your money?

1056
01:17:10.839 --> 01:17:15.010
I'd stop crying about your dead wife,
get off your fucking lazy ass,

1057
01:17:15.093 --> 01:17:16.887
come here and finish the job yourself.

1058
01:17:16.970 --> 01:17:19.056
But as we're having
a bit of a heart-to-heart,

1059
01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:20.599
got a couple things to tell ya.

1060
01:17:20.682 --> 01:17:21.767
Your son's a complete bellend

1061
01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:24.311
and fuckin' deserves
to be bleeding out of his eye sockets.

1062
01:17:24.394 --> 01:17:26.939
And as for your case,
I haven't seen it since Tokyo.

1063
01:17:27.022 --> 01:17:28.524
And I hope someone's fuckin' found it,

1064
01:17:28.607 --> 01:17:31.401
put it all on red
and having a fuckin' wonderful time.

1065
01:17:31.485 --> 01:17:33.529
I will meet you at Kyoto Station.

1066
01:17:33.612 --> 01:17:35.948
Oh, how wonderful. I can't fucking wait.

1067
01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:40.369
I want to look into your eyes
when I kill you and your brother.

1068
01:17:47.084 --> 01:17:47.960
My brother.

1069
01:17:51.839 --> 01:17:54.216
I'm forever blowing bubbles

1070
01:17:54.299 --> 01:17:57.469
Pretty bubbles in the air

1071
01:17:57.553 --> 01:17:59.137
West Ham have taken it!

1072
01:17:59.221 --> 01:18:01.890
West Ham 1, Chelsea nil.

1073
01:18:06.854 --> 01:18:09.439
Morning rush hour's rolling in
quite nicely.

1074
01:18:09.982 --> 01:18:10.816
What's your plan, mate?

1075
01:18:10.899 --> 01:18:13.068
You gonna fuckin' waltz up here
and blow my brains out

1076
01:18:13.151 --> 01:18:15.362
in front of the whole
fuckin' carriage of witnesses?

1077
01:18:15.445 --> 01:18:18.156
There is no one left on that train.

1078
01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:19.700
I know.

1079
01:18:20.325 --> 01:18:24.329
I bought every ticket
until the end of the line.

1080
01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:28.834
Oi.

1081
01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:30.335
You.

1082
01:18:30.919 --> 01:18:31.920
I know you.

1083
01:18:32.713 --> 01:18:34.423
You're that girl, aren't ya?

1084
01:18:34.506 --> 01:18:35.883
Oh, my God.

1085
01:18:35.966 --> 01:18:37.801
Yeah, I never forget a face, me.

1086
01:18:37.885 --> 01:18:40.053
I'm so happy to see you.
Please help me.

1087
01:18:41.346 --> 01:18:43.765
There's this man,
and he was holding me hostage.

1088
01:18:43.849 --> 01:18:47.978
He was wearing glasses,
and he killed my uncle.

1089
01:18:48.061 --> 01:18:50.147
And he also killed
this other man who, I don't know,

1090
01:18:50.272 --> 01:18:54.985
he just kept talking about
Thomas the Trains and--

1091
01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:56.236
Tank Engine.

1092
01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:57.362
Yeah, right. Exactly.

1093
01:18:57.446 --> 01:18:58.780
But he killed both of them,

1094
01:18:58.864 --> 01:19:02.618
and then he said he was going to get away
with some sort of money. I don't know.

1095
01:19:03.243 --> 01:19:06.914
I'm sorry, darling. I beg your pardon.
I don't know who the fuck you are.

1096
01:19:08.540 --> 01:19:12.377
I'm just a girl who was supposed
to get off at Nagoya, and then this man--

1097
01:19:12.461 --> 01:19:13.879
That was fucking ages ago.

1098
01:19:13.962 --> 01:19:17.382
I know, but this man, he just said
that I could be a good backup plan

1099
01:19:17.466 --> 01:19:19.843
and that a pretty girl
makes a good hostage.

1100
01:19:19.927 --> 01:19:23.138
Well, he ain't wrong there.
But, look, keep your fucking knickers on.

1101
01:19:23.222 --> 01:19:25.557
-Please just help me.
-All right. Calm down.

1102
01:19:25.682 --> 01:19:28.101
Get off or do what the fuck you like.
You're free to go.

1103
01:19:28.185 --> 01:19:29.686
-Thank you.
-It's all right. Go on.

1104
01:19:29.770 --> 01:19:31.396
I don't know
what you're doing here anyway.

1105
01:19:36.151 --> 01:19:37.444
Are you okay?

1106
01:19:37.903 --> 01:19:38.779
Diesel.

1107
01:19:39.363 --> 01:19:41.198
The absolutely fucking worst.

1108
01:19:41.865 --> 01:19:43.200
Little shit stirrer.

1109
01:19:46.161 --> 01:19:48.664
See, Lemon...

1110
01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:52.835
God rest his soul,

1111
01:19:54.127 --> 01:19:55.170
was the don.

1112
01:19:56.630 --> 01:19:58.006
And he could read people,

1113
01:19:58.549 --> 01:20:00.175
see them for who they really are.

1114
01:20:00.926 --> 01:20:02.427
He was right.

1115
01:20:03.053 --> 01:20:04.304
There's been a Diesel

1116
01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:09.351
running up and down this train,
causing all sorts of fucking havoc.

1117
01:20:10.185 --> 01:20:13.939
And it was you the whole fucking time,
you dirty little Diesel!

1118
01:20:17.693 --> 01:20:19.194
You made Lemon bleed...

1119
01:20:19.945 --> 01:20:21.864
and Lemon never bleeds.

1120
01:20:22.906 --> 01:20:24.950
Oh, my God! Mister, please help me!

1121
01:20:25.033 --> 01:20:27.494
Please! Please help me! Please!

1122
01:20:27.578 --> 01:20:29.413
What the fuck are you doing,
you bellend!

1123
01:20:47.264 --> 01:20:48.307
What?

1124
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:49.391
Diesel!

1125
01:20:49.474 --> 01:20:50.642
What?

1126
01:20:50.726 --> 01:20:52.728
You fucking bellend!

1127
01:20:57.191 --> 01:20:58.358
You're a Diesel.

1128
01:20:59.985 --> 01:21:01.737
What the fuck?

1129
01:21:04.156 --> 01:21:05.324
What the fuck?

1130
01:21:06.074 --> 01:21:09.494
He said that he was going to kill you
and blame everything on you.

1131
01:21:10.579 --> 01:21:15.083
He also said that there's someone
waiting for us at Kyoto Station.

1132
01:21:15.876 --> 01:21:18.921
Someone scary, who would hurt me.

1133
01:21:19.963 --> 01:21:21.590
No one's gonna hurt you.

1134
01:21:22.132 --> 01:21:23.509
It's okay.

1135
01:21:24.301 --> 01:21:25.719
We're getting off this train.

1136
01:21:34.478 --> 01:21:36.730
We make the next stop, we'll be fine.

1137
01:21:57.042 --> 01:21:58.001
Okay, kid, come o--

1138
01:21:58.085 --> 01:21:59.211
Kid, come on!

1139
01:22:00.003 --> 01:22:01.630
I can't, my backpack is stuck!

1140
01:22:01.713 --> 01:22:02.756
What?

1141
01:22:03.674 --> 01:22:04.800
Leave it, let's go.

1142
01:22:04.883 --> 01:22:06.677
-We gotta go, we gotta go.
-No, I can't!

1143
01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.053
Right now, young lady!

1144
01:22:08.136 --> 01:22:10.097
-No!
-It's our last chance!

1145
01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.390
Please come back!

1146
01:22:11.515 --> 01:22:12.808
Kid, please.

1147
01:22:12.891 --> 01:22:15.769
I'm scared,
I don't want to be alone, please!

1148
01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:22.484
I got it.

1149
01:22:22.568 --> 01:22:25.112
It's not your fault, kid.

1150
01:22:25.779 --> 01:22:27.531
It's my luck, not yours.

1151
01:22:30.075 --> 01:22:32.327
You got your whole life ahead of you.

1152
01:22:32.828 --> 01:22:35.122
Make sure you do something
that brings you peace.

1153
01:22:35.956 --> 01:22:38.625
'Cause everything else
is a pain in the ass.

1154
01:22:39.418 --> 01:22:43.046
And if you run into a guy named Carver,
he's a dick.

1155
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:44.715
You can tell him I said so.

1156
01:22:52.306 --> 01:22:54.099
I took this. I didn't want to leave it.

1157
01:22:55.100 --> 01:22:57.436
The man had it,
and I thought you could probably use it

1158
01:22:57.519 --> 01:23:00.314
to kill whoever's waiting
for us at the end of the line.

1159
01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:03.025
You're not going to let me get hurt.

1160
01:23:03.108 --> 01:23:04.526
Be honest.

1161
01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.279
Be honest.

1162
01:23:07.362 --> 01:23:08.822
Who's there with you?

1163
01:23:14.828 --> 01:23:15.829
Really?

1164
01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.414
Right.

1165
01:23:18.081 --> 01:23:20.626
Okay, fella, you're creepin' me out.

1166
01:23:20.709 --> 01:23:24.838
So, if you don't mind,
could you just find another seat, like,

1167
01:23:24.922 --> 01:23:28.217
way, way, way down there?

1168
01:23:28.300 --> 01:23:32.262
And that way,
I won't have to tell you twice.

1169
01:23:33.013 --> 01:23:33.847
No.

1170
01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:35.849
You won't.

1171
01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.815
Let's just move. Let me grab your bag.

1172
01:23:56.995 --> 01:23:58.247
Was that a snake?

1173
01:23:58.330 --> 01:24:00.082
Would you know where my son is?

1174
01:24:21.061 --> 01:24:22.312
Oh, fuck.

1175
01:24:34.575 --> 01:24:35.701
After everything.

1176
01:24:42.332 --> 01:24:43.959
You are the person

1177
01:24:44.418 --> 01:24:48.046
who pushed my grandson
off the department store roof.

1178
01:24:48.130 --> 01:24:49.256
Why?

1179
01:24:49.339 --> 01:24:50.465
Your son.

1180
01:24:51.341 --> 01:24:54.636
He was going to help me
kill the White Death at Kyoto Station.

1181
01:24:55.762 --> 01:24:58.348
And that was the only way
to get him on this train.

1182
01:25:01.518 --> 01:25:02.936
The White Death.

1183
01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:04.479
That's right.

1184
01:25:04.605 --> 01:25:06.982
But he couldn't even do that.

1185
01:25:08.609 --> 01:25:09.610
So he's dead.

1186
01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.904
Just a few cars back.

1187
01:25:12.613 --> 01:25:14.031
They are both dead.

1188
01:25:21.914 --> 01:25:24.666
My grandson was pushed off a roof.

1189
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:28.795
What makes you think
I would leave him unprotected?

1190
01:25:52.569 --> 01:25:54.780
My grandson is safe.

1191
01:25:55.864 --> 01:25:57.950
And my son is not dead.

1192
01:25:58.659 --> 01:26:00.661
Listen, old man--

1193
01:26:00.744 --> 01:26:03.497
The only thing you know
about an old man, young lady,

1194
01:26:04.248 --> 01:26:06.667
is that he has survived much more,

1195
01:26:06.750 --> 01:26:10.420
and much worse, than you.

1196
01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.348
I'll fucking kill him myself.

1197
01:26:30.816 --> 01:26:32.442
-Are you all right?
-From that?

1198
01:26:34.111 --> 01:26:36.572
You're not gonna believe
this coincidence

1199
01:26:36.655 --> 01:26:41.118
but I already got a dose of antivenom
in me today, so I'm good.

1200
01:26:42.411 --> 01:26:43.704
Probably.

1201
01:26:46.039 --> 01:26:46.999
The girl....

1202
01:26:47.082 --> 01:26:49.793
Her intentions with you
were not honorable.

1203
01:26:49.918 --> 01:26:51.587
Yeah.

1204
01:26:51.670 --> 01:26:55.007
A blind man could see
you are the one in the dark.

1205
01:26:55.132 --> 01:26:58.010
I don't know about a blind man.
She was pretty convincing.

1206
01:26:59.011 --> 01:27:01.638
-What did you do to her?
-I did not need to do anything.

1207
01:27:02.556 --> 01:27:05.100
Fate will do what it wills.

1208
01:27:07.644 --> 01:27:09.855
Why do you laugh at fate?

1209
01:27:11.148 --> 01:27:16.069
Man, fate for me is
just another word for bad luck.

1210
01:27:17.321 --> 01:27:21.783
And that follows me around like....

1211
01:27:24.119 --> 01:27:25.996
I don't know, something witty.

1212
01:27:29.833 --> 01:27:31.668
My handler calls me Ladybug.

1213
01:27:32.377 --> 01:27:33.670
She's witty.

1214
01:27:33.754 --> 01:27:35.088
Ladybug?

1215
01:27:35.172 --> 01:27:36.006
Yeah.

1216
01:27:36.089 --> 01:27:38.592
This is very lucky, indeed.

1217
01:27:40.344 --> 01:27:42.471
No, she's being ironic, she--

1218
01:27:43.347 --> 01:27:44.223
Never mind.

1219
01:27:44.306 --> 01:27:46.350
I'm going to tell you a story now.

1220
01:27:46.433 --> 01:27:48.060
-No, I'm good.
-It's short.

1221
01:27:48.769 --> 01:27:49.686
Really, I'm fine.

1222
01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:51.897
No, it's very quick.

1223
01:27:52.648 --> 01:27:53.565
No, no.

1224
01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:55.901
It's a good story for you, I think.

1225
01:27:56.485 --> 01:27:57.361
I'm cool.

1226
01:27:57.444 --> 01:27:58.487
Here we go.

1227
01:28:00.489 --> 01:28:01.907
A long time ago,

1228
01:28:02.491 --> 01:28:04.409
I made a promise to myself

1229
01:28:06.078 --> 01:28:10.499
that I would provide for my family
no matter what it cost.

1230
01:28:13.752 --> 01:28:19.091
I had risen to a highly coveted position
within the Minegishi crime family.

1231
01:28:19.758 --> 01:28:22.010
A man raised up to take my place.

1232
01:28:22.094 --> 01:28:24.012
A man from the North.

1233
01:28:30.185 --> 01:28:33.605
I asked Minegishi not to trust this man.

1234
01:28:34.565 --> 01:28:38.610
Minegishi told me I had lost my appetite.

1235
01:28:38.694 --> 01:28:39.653
He was not wrong.

1236
01:28:40.737 --> 01:28:42.239
But neither was I.

1237
01:29:05.262 --> 01:29:06.305
I returned home

1238
01:29:06.388 --> 01:29:11.018
and found nothing except ash and blood.

1239
01:29:29.161 --> 01:29:32.247
The White Death
had taken everything from me.

1240
01:29:32.331 --> 01:29:34.082
Almost.

1241
01:29:46.011 --> 01:29:47.471
I went into hiding.

1242
01:29:48.388 --> 01:29:51.433
I searched for a way
to strike at the White Death

1243
01:29:51.517 --> 01:29:54.144
without endangering what I had left.

1244
01:29:54.853 --> 01:29:57.105
But he remained forever out of reach.

1245
01:29:58.857 --> 01:30:00.234
I did not think

1246
01:30:00.317 --> 01:30:03.987
fate would ever give me
a chance to make things right.

1247
01:30:06.073 --> 01:30:09.034
Do you know what they call
a ladybug in Japan?

1248
01:30:12.162 --> 01:30:13.330
Tentoumushi.

1249
01:30:13.872 --> 01:30:18.001
As a boy, I was told
there is a spot on its back

1250
01:30:18.085 --> 01:30:20.587
for each
of the seven sorrows of the world.

1251
01:30:21.588 --> 01:30:24.800
You see, tentoumushi is not lucky.

1252
01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:30.389
It holds all the bad luck
so that others may live in peace.

1253
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:35.727
I don't wanna hold the seven sorrows.

1254
01:30:35.811 --> 01:30:39.773
Everything that's ever happened to you
has led you here.

1255
01:30:41.567 --> 01:30:42.609
Fate.

1256
01:30:43.193 --> 01:30:45.028
Well, that's a shit deal.

1257
01:30:46.947 --> 01:30:48.323
At Kyoto Station,

1258
01:30:49.157 --> 01:30:51.994
the White Death
will arrive on this train.

1259
01:30:53.036 --> 01:30:56.039
I will finally be allowed
to make things right.

1260
01:30:57.708 --> 01:30:59.668
My son is a few cars up.

1261
01:30:59.751 --> 01:31:02.462
If you could escort him off this train....

1262
01:31:03.505 --> 01:31:07.885
Yeah, I don't see the White Death
letting any of us off this train.

1263
01:31:09.636 --> 01:31:11.847
You let me worry
about the White Death.

1264
01:31:14.516 --> 01:31:15.350
Okay.

1265
01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:19.813
Mr. Ladybug?

1266
01:31:22.482 --> 01:31:24.943
-Your briefcase.
-Thank you.

1267
01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:37.915
Father.

1268
01:31:39.750 --> 01:31:40.792
I don't understand.

1269
01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:43.754
It is fate, my son.

1270
01:31:44.421 --> 01:31:45.589
And Wataru?

1271
01:31:45.672 --> 01:31:46.882
He is safe.

1272
01:31:50.302 --> 01:31:51.261
Well...

1273
01:31:51.929 --> 01:31:53.514
he seemed like a decent guy.

1274
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:55.933
He shot me.

1275
01:31:56.558 --> 01:31:57.518
Me, too.

1276
01:31:57.601 --> 01:31:58.435
Twice.

1277
01:31:59.353 --> 01:32:00.979
Still, he had another side to him--

1278
01:32:03.524 --> 01:32:04.608
Wow.

1279
01:32:08.487 --> 01:32:09.613
Oh, man.

1280
01:32:11.031 --> 01:32:12.115
Am I in hell?

1281
01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:16.662
Ah, fuck.

1282
01:32:20.791 --> 01:32:22.125
Fuckin' vest, man.

1283
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:25.963
Oh, you drank the water.

1284
01:32:30.259 --> 01:32:32.094
Where the fuck is my brother?

1285
01:33:03.333 --> 01:33:04.418
Aw, man.

1286
01:33:18.849 --> 01:33:19.725
You....

1287
01:33:24.938 --> 01:33:26.982
You were more
like Thomas anyway, right?

1288
01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:02.643
Fellas.

1289
01:34:02.726 --> 01:34:05.103
We need to come up with a plan.

1290
01:34:05.187 --> 01:34:09.149
You killed my brother.
You killed my brother, you piece of shit!

1291
01:34:09.233 --> 01:34:11.527
Yeah, you fucking shot me!

1292
01:34:11.610 --> 01:34:13.403
I'll shoot you in the fucking throat
next time

1293
01:34:13.487 --> 01:34:15.364
and your fucking partner Keira Knightley!

1294
01:34:15.447 --> 01:34:17.407
-She is not my--
-Hey! Fellas!

1295
01:34:17.491 --> 01:34:20.577
When we are so quick to anger,
we are slow to understand.

1296
01:34:20.661 --> 01:34:22.621
I'm fast to kick your ass, though,
I swear to God.

1297
01:34:24.206 --> 01:34:27.292
Fucking piece of shit! I shoulda
put a bullet through your fucking ass!

1298
01:34:27.376 --> 01:34:29.711
When you point a finger
at someone in blame,

1299
01:34:29.795 --> 01:34:31.839
there are four fingers
pointing back at you.

1300
01:34:32.506 --> 01:34:34.758
Or three. That's weird.

1301
01:34:34.842 --> 01:34:37.177
Fuck it! That's it!
You know what I could do!

1302
01:34:37.261 --> 01:34:39.596
-We before me!
-You before fucking God--

1303
01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:40.722
Gentlemen!

1304
01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:42.808
Get off me!

1305
01:34:43.642 --> 01:34:48.897
A plum does not resent the hungry man,
but the farmer who planted the tree.

1306
01:34:50.983 --> 01:34:53.068
He resents the farmer?

1307
01:34:53.151 --> 01:34:55.988
So how do plums have fuckin' resentments?
So how can it resent?

1308
01:34:56.071 --> 01:34:58.907
Listen. The White Death is the farmer.

1309
01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:03.453
So we're the plums. We're the plums?

1310
01:35:03.537 --> 01:35:05.998
It don't make sense.
Why are you motherfuckers using metaphors?

1311
01:35:06.081 --> 01:35:07.666
Look, he shot my fucking brother!

1312
01:35:07.749 --> 01:35:09.418
You shot my son!

1313
01:35:13.422 --> 01:35:15.048
We prepare together...

1314
01:35:16.008 --> 01:35:17.509
or we die alone.

1315
01:35:19.344 --> 01:35:21.054
That's all I was trying to say.

1316
01:35:24.808 --> 01:35:29.521
The White Death waits for you
with his army of assassins.

1317
01:35:29.605 --> 01:35:32.191
Killers from all countries.

1318
01:35:32.774 --> 01:35:38.113
But he has no idea
my son and I are on this train.

1319
01:35:38.697 --> 01:35:40.157
If fate wills,

1320
01:35:41.033 --> 01:35:42.910
I will get my revenge.

1321
01:35:44.453 --> 01:35:47.998
I'll head to the back
and stop as many as I can.

1322
01:35:48.498 --> 01:35:52.085
I'll go to the driver car
and get us the fuck out of here.

1323
01:35:57.090 --> 01:35:59.760
What are you gonna do, Joburg?

1324
01:36:01.887 --> 01:36:03.222
I'm gonna buy us some time.

1325
01:37:01.405 --> 01:37:02.447
Daughter.

1326
01:37:04.241 --> 01:37:05.409
Father.

1327
01:37:13.584 --> 01:37:16.461
Hey, fellas, I'm looking for a Mr. Death.

1328
01:37:16.587 --> 01:37:18.088
Got his case here.

1329
01:37:18.839 --> 01:37:20.215
Hey, easy.

1330
01:37:28.515 --> 01:37:30.184
Hurt people hurt people.

1331
01:37:37.149 --> 01:37:38.567
I came to see you.

1332
01:37:40.694 --> 01:37:43.113
And to make you finally see me.

1333
01:37:45.073 --> 01:37:46.575
The real me.

1334
01:37:49.411 --> 01:37:53.165
I built myself up
from the nothing you gave me.

1335
01:37:53.248 --> 01:37:56.043
All so I could be
the one in front of you today...

1336
01:37:57.002 --> 01:37:58.629
my finger on the trigger.

1337
01:38:00.881 --> 01:38:02.466
I was the one...

1338
01:38:03.592 --> 01:38:05.469
...who deserved your attention.

1339
01:38:09.723 --> 01:38:10.891
Your love.

1340
01:38:11.892 --> 01:38:15.479
I'm more like you
than that little fuckup ever was.

1341
01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:30.827
Do it.

1342
01:38:33.247 --> 01:38:34.665
I came here to kill you.

1343
01:38:37.084 --> 01:38:38.418
So kill me.

1344
01:38:40.754 --> 01:38:43.549
Kill me like you did
all the others who tried the same.

1345
01:38:55.060 --> 01:38:56.144
Do it.

1346
01:39:02.484 --> 01:39:03.819
Fucking do it!

1347
01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:10.701
Pow.

1348
01:39:17.541 --> 01:39:19.126
I see you, dochka.

1349
01:39:20.377 --> 01:39:22.296
I always have.

1350
01:39:24.673 --> 01:39:28.468
But you have never been part of my plan.

1351
01:39:34.558 --> 01:39:36.018
We found the American!

1352
01:39:39.104 --> 01:39:40.522
What about the others?

1353
01:39:40.606 --> 01:39:41.940
They're all dead.

1354
01:39:42.566 --> 01:39:45.485
Good news is I have your case.

1355
01:39:46.737 --> 01:39:49.114
Ay, good news, good news.

1356
01:39:49.198 --> 01:39:50.908
Check the case.

1357
01:39:50.991 --> 01:39:53.410
Hurry. Move. Let's go.

1358
01:39:55.037 --> 01:39:56.288
Clear the train.

1359
01:39:58.498 --> 01:40:01.960
All right, Thomas.
Time for you to start up--

1360
01:40:02.044 --> 01:40:04.588
Oh, shit. Everything's in Japanese.

1361
01:40:04.671 --> 01:40:06.590
There is no episode in Japanese.
What the f--?

1362
01:40:11.136 --> 01:40:12.387
Get on the ground!

1363
01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:23.190
Man, I got a bad feeling about this.
We have no idea what's in this case.

1364
01:40:23.273 --> 01:40:24.316
What are you talkin' about?

1365
01:40:24.399 --> 01:40:26.818
Why is it always gotta be us
that opens this shit?

1366
01:40:26.902 --> 01:40:28.612
Just open the goddamn case.

1367
01:40:28.695 --> 01:40:30.405
I'd like to keep my fuckin' arms.

1368
01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:33.534
Mr. Death, if I may?

1369
01:40:34.785 --> 01:40:36.662
The shadow buyer

1370
01:40:37.329 --> 01:40:40.999
who bought all our contracts,
got us all on this train.

1371
01:40:41.083 --> 01:40:42.042
Me, the Hornet,

1372
01:40:42.125 --> 01:40:43.585
Tangerine, Lemon....

1373
01:40:45.337 --> 01:40:46.797
That was you, right?

1374
01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:50.092
Yes, very astute.

1375
01:40:50.175 --> 01:40:52.970
I brought you on this train
hoping you'd kill each other.

1376
01:40:53.053 --> 01:40:53.929
Okay.

1377
01:40:56.014 --> 01:40:58.684
If I could.... Why?

1378
01:40:58.767 --> 01:41:01.103
Why you do what you do?

1379
01:41:01.186 --> 01:41:03.897
You know, I've been
asking that very question.

1380
01:41:03.981 --> 01:41:06.358
If it's so safe,
why didn't he just open it?

1381
01:41:06.441 --> 01:41:08.777
What if it's a bomb
and it blows up in our faces?

1382
01:41:08.861 --> 01:41:11.321
You think these stupid masks
are gonna protect us?

1383
01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:18.829
All these years later...

1384
01:41:18.912 --> 01:41:23.292
the burden of your betrayal
still heavy upon your heads.

1385
01:41:25.627 --> 01:41:28.046
Let me relieve you of both.

1386
01:41:29.131 --> 01:41:30.424
My wife...

1387
01:41:31.758 --> 01:41:33.135
was taken from me.

1388
01:41:36.555 --> 01:41:40.893
I heard. I'm so sorry for your loss.
It was a horrible accident.

1389
01:41:42.978 --> 01:41:44.813
-Horrible.
-Oh, no.

1390
01:41:44.897 --> 01:41:48.400
No. Nothing in life is an accident.

1391
01:41:49.026 --> 01:41:51.987
It was an assassination attempt on me.

1392
01:41:52.070 --> 01:41:52.946
But fate....

1393
01:41:54.948 --> 01:41:58.327
Fate put two wet work operatives,

1394
01:41:58.869 --> 01:42:02.372
twins, on a job in Bolivia,

1395
01:42:03.790 --> 01:42:06.793
butchering my entire crew.

1396
01:42:06.877 --> 01:42:09.630
And I had to go deal with it.

1397
01:42:09.713 --> 01:42:12.090
And he didn't hire
two random operators, Lemon.

1398
01:42:12.174 --> 01:42:14.551
No, he asked for the two
responsible for the Bolivia job.

1399
01:42:14.635 --> 01:42:19.765
That is why it was my wife
in the car that night,

1400
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:21.350
not me.

1401
01:42:21.808 --> 01:42:24.895
Fate put my wife in the hospital.

1402
01:42:25.687 --> 01:42:27.523
A piece of her rib

1403
01:42:28.398 --> 01:42:30.442
piercing her heart.

1404
01:42:32.861 --> 01:42:37.991
Only the most skilled cardiovascular
surgeon could save her life.

1405
01:42:40.327 --> 01:42:45.332
But two nights earlier,
this surgeon was poisoned.

1406
01:42:48.043 --> 01:42:48.877
Oh, my God!

1407
01:42:48.961 --> 01:42:51.672
Fate. Fate again.

1408
01:42:52.506 --> 01:42:53.966
They said my money was in the case!

1409
01:42:54.800 --> 01:42:58.428
Don't wanna sound judgmental,
but if you hired the Hornet,

1410
01:42:58.554 --> 01:43:00.722
you had your own kid killed?

1411
01:43:00.806 --> 01:43:02.474
-Oh, yes.
-Okay.

1412
01:43:02.558 --> 01:43:04.852
Oh, yes, I did. The piece of shit.

1413
01:43:05.352 --> 01:43:06.353
Please, please.

1414
01:43:06.436 --> 01:43:07.396
That night...

1415
01:43:08.146 --> 01:43:10.858
-Please pick me up.
-...I told her not to leave.

1416
01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:13.193
To wait for me.

1417
01:43:13.819 --> 01:43:18.782
But she promised it was the last time
we would ever bail him out of trouble.

1418
01:43:18.866 --> 01:43:21.285
I will come. I will always come for you.

1419
01:43:21.994 --> 01:43:25.497
Well, I suppose she was right.

1420
01:43:26.248 --> 01:43:29.751
If I had amputated that weakness

1421
01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:32.421
out of my life years ago,

1422
01:43:32.504 --> 01:43:35.299
she would still be by my side!

1423
01:43:35.883 --> 01:43:39.011
Yeah, it helps to process this.
I have a good therapist.

1424
01:43:39.094 --> 01:43:40.971
I loved my wife very much.

1425
01:43:42.389 --> 01:43:44.224
She taught me a valuable lesson.

1426
01:43:44.933 --> 01:43:47.019
If you do not control your fate...

1427
01:43:48.353 --> 01:43:49.563
it will control you.

1428
01:43:51.273 --> 01:43:53.567
So I took control.

1429
01:43:53.650 --> 01:43:55.444
I brought them all here to die.

1430
01:44:00.324 --> 01:44:03.535
But now there is only one left.

1431
01:44:05.704 --> 01:44:07.581
Mr. Carver.

1432
01:44:09.458 --> 01:44:10.584
Excuse me?

1433
01:44:10.667 --> 01:44:12.628
I'm filling in for Carver?
Calling in sick?

1434
01:44:12.711 --> 01:44:14.004
Fuck Carver.

1435
01:44:14.087 --> 01:44:16.507
The man who murdered my wife.

1436
01:44:22.930 --> 01:44:23.764
Bro.

1437
01:44:23.847 --> 01:44:26.391
-Just open it!
-Fine. Ya happy?

1438
01:44:26.475 --> 01:44:27.309
I'm not Carver!

1439
01:44:44.368 --> 01:44:45.244
He went that way.

1440
01:44:54.545 --> 01:44:56.129
Oh, shit. Okay.

1441
01:44:57.172 --> 01:44:58.882
Oh, shit. Something's happening.

1442
01:45:27.452 --> 01:45:28.829
Excuse me.

1443
01:45:30.205 --> 01:45:31.206
Yep.

1444
01:46:12.372 --> 01:46:13.916
Kimura.

1445
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:15.709
Why are you here?

1446
01:46:16.668 --> 01:46:17.878
Your daughter.

1447
01:46:17.961 --> 01:46:19.838
It would seem she pushed...

1448
01:46:19.922 --> 01:46:22.549
the wrong grandson off a roof.

1449
01:46:26.261 --> 01:46:29.640
Ah, children. You do the best you can
to raise them right.

1450
01:46:31.433 --> 01:46:33.227
Cockroach,
I do not know why you are here,

1451
01:46:33.352 --> 01:46:36.605
but move out of my way
or you will join your wife.

1452
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:40.275
Our paths were destined
to return to each other.

1453
01:46:43.403 --> 01:46:44.279
Okay.

1454
01:46:44.863 --> 01:46:48.075
Wait. Fuckin' slow down, mate. Come on!

1455
01:46:48.158 --> 01:46:50.869
Hey, so far so good.
You can stop the train.

1456
01:46:50.953 --> 01:46:54.248
About that. I took the velocity
of the train and divided it by the mass,

1457
01:46:54.331 --> 01:46:57.167
and I realized that I don't know how
to fuckin' drive a bullet train.

1458
01:46:57.251 --> 01:46:59.002
Dude, all you do is talk about trains.

1459
01:46:59.086 --> 01:47:01.421
Thomas is a metaphor for life,
not how to actually drive--

1460
01:47:01.547 --> 01:47:02.881
Get down!

1461
01:47:29.867 --> 01:47:30.909
Shit.

1462
01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.502
I got this! Stop the train!

1463
01:47:40.586 --> 01:47:41.753
What?!

1464
01:48:33.472 --> 01:48:34.806
English, English, English, English.

1465
01:48:35.516 --> 01:48:37.184
English. Brakes!

1466
01:48:37.267 --> 01:48:39.394
We're good! I got it!

1467
01:48:40.854 --> 01:48:41.730
No!

1468
01:48:44.775 --> 01:48:46.985
-Hold on!
-We're on the wrong track!

1469
01:49:01.834 --> 01:49:03.335
-Oi, Joburg!
-What?

1470
01:49:06.547 --> 01:49:07.923
I'm sorry I shot you!

1471
01:49:08.006 --> 01:49:10.092
Actually it was, like, twice!

1472
01:49:14.179 --> 01:49:15.097
Sorry?

1473
01:49:15.180 --> 01:49:17.140
You shot me twice!

1474
01:49:28.986 --> 01:49:30.279
I'm sorry I shot you twice.

1475
01:49:32.406 --> 01:49:33.365
Thanks, man!

1476
01:49:34.199 --> 01:49:35.534
That shows real growth!

1477
01:49:39.872 --> 01:49:42.332
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck.

1478
01:49:51.717 --> 01:49:53.343
You are not ruled by strength.

1479
01:49:53.427 --> 01:49:54.803
You are ruled by fear!

1480
01:49:55.762 --> 01:49:58.348
Fear of the one thing
deep down you cannot control!

1481
01:50:06.190 --> 01:50:07.608
Fear of fate!

1482
01:50:15.949 --> 01:50:18.952
Hey, and I'm sorry about Tangerine.

1483
01:50:20.245 --> 01:50:21.288
Yeah.

1484
01:50:22.497 --> 01:50:23.457
Yeah.

1485
01:50:24.958 --> 01:50:26.376
But I got another brother now.

1486
01:50:27.002 --> 01:50:27.878
Really?

1487
01:50:30.797 --> 01:50:31.715
Fuck no!

1488
01:50:56.031 --> 01:50:57.741
For old times' sake.

1489
01:51:39.283 --> 01:51:40.367
Fuck it.

1490
01:52:04.433 --> 01:52:06.059
$#%*

1491
01:52:11.023 --> 01:52:12.608
B-20.

1492
01:52:13.984 --> 01:52:14.985
Let's go.

1493
01:52:17.446 --> 01:52:18.989
-Oh, mate.
-Yeah?

1494
01:52:19.531 --> 01:52:20.908
I wanted bubble milk tea.

1495
01:52:20.991 --> 01:52:22.159
How about a Wagon Wheel?

1496
01:52:52.397 --> 01:52:53.607
A father...

1497
01:52:54.274 --> 01:52:55.317
protects his family.

1498
01:54:27.868 --> 01:54:30.913
Oh, fuck.

1499
01:54:34.291 --> 01:54:37.377
About your wife,
I had nothing to do with that.

1500
01:54:38.086 --> 01:54:39.171
It's a mistake.

1501
01:54:39.296 --> 01:54:40.964
I'm not Carver.

1502
01:54:42.382 --> 01:54:44.843
I only do snatch-and-grab jobs.

1503
01:54:45.427 --> 01:54:48.805
The Carver! I want the Carver!
I hired the Carver!

1504
01:54:48.889 --> 01:54:51.308
No, he had a stomach thing, man.

1505
01:54:51.391 --> 01:54:52.976
I'm just filling in.

1506
01:54:57.689 --> 01:54:59.149
You're filling in.

1507
01:54:59.233 --> 01:55:02.194
For what it's worth, Carver is a dick.

1508
01:55:02.277 --> 01:55:04.279
The most cunning assassin...?

1509
01:55:04.780 --> 01:55:06.240
Maybe the laziest.

1510
01:55:15.749 --> 01:55:17.376
Aw, come on.

1511
01:55:18.335 --> 01:55:19.920
Just let it go, bro.

1512
01:55:20.003 --> 01:55:22.798
Do not call me "bro"!

1513
01:55:24.424 --> 01:55:25.509
Okay.

1514
01:55:41.441 --> 01:55:42.609
Dude, did you see that?

1515
01:55:43.527 --> 01:55:44.403
What was that?

1516
01:55:51.118 --> 01:55:52.160
Dude.

1517
01:55:54.079 --> 01:55:55.247
It's done.

1518
01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:12.973
Hey, about this plum. Shouldn't the plum
give up all resentment? Like--

1519
01:56:14.933 --> 01:56:16.476
Oh, my God.

1520
01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.815
It's my luck that delivered
my father's corpse at my feet.

1521
01:56:21.899 --> 01:56:24.401
The narcissism on this chick.

1522
01:56:24.484 --> 01:56:25.527
Untreatable.

1523
01:56:25.652 --> 01:56:27.029
Now I am--

1524
01:56:27.112 --> 01:56:29.114
Okay, wait, wait, wait.

1525
01:56:29.198 --> 01:56:30.115
What?

1526
01:56:30.199 --> 01:56:32.576
What is with this fucked-up family?

1527
01:56:33.493 --> 01:56:35.787
You need some suggested reading,
if I may.

1528
01:56:36.455 --> 01:56:38.332
Surviving Borderline Personality Disorder.

1529
01:56:38.415 --> 01:56:39.374
What?

1530
01:56:39.458 --> 01:56:40.584
I highly recommend it.

1531
01:56:40.667 --> 01:56:43.712
Now I am the White D--

1532
01:56:46.798 --> 01:56:47.758
What was that?

1533
01:56:51.470 --> 01:56:52.888
Was that karma?

1534
01:56:52.971 --> 01:56:55.557
Farewell, tentoumushi.

1535
01:56:58.185 --> 01:56:59.269
Tangerine.

1536
01:57:16.912 --> 01:57:17.996
Maria?

1537
01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:19.164
Take the gun.

1538
01:57:19.248 --> 01:57:20.791
Oh, my God, did you just say "whack"?

1539
01:57:20.916 --> 01:57:23.377
We're almost there.
You just need to get up.

1540
01:57:23.460 --> 01:57:25.170
Did you come to rescue me?

1541
01:57:26.171 --> 01:57:27.548
Did you need rescuing?

1542
01:57:27.631 --> 01:57:29.299
You came to rescue me.

1543
01:57:29.383 --> 01:57:30.884
Please don't make me regret it.

1544
01:57:32.553 --> 01:57:36.807
Okay, don't. Don't. What's happening
to your face? Are you crying?

1545
01:57:36.890 --> 01:57:38.308
It's a lot to process.

1546
01:57:39.059 --> 01:57:42.020
I want you to know, you are the greatest,

1547
01:57:42.104 --> 01:57:44.731
most wonderful handler

1548
01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:47.693
that I could ever have. Ever. Ever.

1549
01:57:48.277 --> 01:57:50.946
Do you think maybe
there was a little head trauma?

1550
01:57:51.029 --> 01:57:52.781
-Maybe.
-Little bit, yeah.

1551
01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:55.284
-A little lightheaded.
-Yeah. Need a banana?

1552
01:57:55.367 --> 01:57:57.536
-Potassium might be good.
-Have one in the car.

1553
01:57:58.120 --> 01:57:58.954
Hey.

1554
01:57:59.037 --> 01:58:01.832
Next time, take the gun.
Don't listen to Barry.

1555
01:58:01.915 --> 01:58:03.750
Okay? Simple.

1556
01:58:06.336 --> 01:58:07.588
Stop it.

1557
01:58:08.589 --> 01:58:09.423
-Stop.
-You know,

1558
01:58:09.506 --> 01:58:12.092
-I think you were right about one thing.
-Usually am. Come on.

1559
01:58:12.634 --> 01:58:14.928
Maybe it is just about how we frame it.

1560
01:58:15.012 --> 01:58:17.014
Like, maybe there's no bad luck
or good luck.

1561
01:58:17.097 --> 01:58:18.849
Maybe we're all just agents of fate.

1562
01:58:19.975 --> 01:58:21.560
-Nice car.
-Yes, it is.

1563
01:58:21.643 --> 01:58:22.811
Try not to bleed on it.

1564
01:58:29.985 --> 01:58:32.487
Holy mol--

1565
01:58:34.907 --> 01:58:35.824
Well....

1566
01:58:37.743 --> 01:58:39.536
How do you know it's a bad thing?

1567
01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:42.748
Really?

1568
01:58:42.831 --> 01:58:44.833
-See what I'm doing?
-I do.

1569
01:58:44.917 --> 01:58:46.919
-Turning that upside down.
-I do.

1570
01:58:48.295 --> 01:58:49.171
This is working.

1571
01:58:50.339 --> 01:58:51.256
Yeah.

1572
01:58:57.554 --> 01:58:58.889
Wasabi peas.

1573
01:58:59.515 --> 01:59:01.892
Fate obviously didn't want me
to have that banana.

1574
01:59:02.017 --> 01:59:04.186
Fate did not want us
to get in that car.

1575
01:59:04.269 --> 01:59:06.730
Well, maybe you've learned something
after all.

1576
01:59:07.731 --> 01:59:09.691
Fate needs me to find a smart toilet.

1577
01:59:09.775 --> 01:59:12.486
-I take that back. Can you hold it?
-I'm ballpointing.

1578
01:59:12.569 --> 01:59:15.280
-Walk faster.
-Okay. Yeah.

1579
01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:42.891
I'm alive! I'm ali--

1580
01:59:43.559 --> 01:59:45.811
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.

1581
01:59:49.898 --> 01:59:51.024
Come on, you fucker.

1582
01:59:51.650 --> 01:59:52.693
Fuck you!

1583
01:59:57.155 --> 01:59:58.824
Stop! Fucking stop!

1584
02:00:01.952 --> 02:00:03.078
Tangerines.

1585
02:00:03.161 --> 02:00:04.413
Fuck Diesels.

1586
02:00:05.038 --> 02:00:07.583
-I am the White D--
-Fuck you, Diesel bitch!

1587
02:00:09.877 --> 02:00:14.173
Final curtain, huh? Final curtain!
Take a fucking bow!
