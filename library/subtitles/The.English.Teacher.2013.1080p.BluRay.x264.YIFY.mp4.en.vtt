00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.846
Uh! Hi.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.084
Linda sinclair
had reached her 45th year,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.328
an unwed high school
English teacher,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.847
with no prospect of marriage.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.686
Hers appeared to be a rather ordinary
life,

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.280
One of discipline...

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.367
I have these.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.006
Frugality...

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.685
Small indignities...

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.040
Whoa! Whoa! Oh.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.405
Modest hopes...

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.962
Oh, I'm all right.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.526
Daddy! Over here!

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.404
And disappointments.
Oh, dear.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.891
She lived alone
in Kingston, Pennsylvania,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.207
not far from
where she was born.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.563
She enjoyed no great luxuries.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.445
Preferring instead
the simple pleasures.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.201
And though her life
may sound cold and dull,

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.082
let me assure you that Ms. Linda
sinclair was neither.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.402
She was a passionate woman.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.885
A romantic.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.082
That was why she was alone,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.931
for she had always been alone.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.324
As a sensitive child,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.762
Linda found her sanctuary
in literature.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.406
The great works stirred
in her an excitement,

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.170
an irrepressible thrill

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.489
that made the mundane world
seem all the more bleak.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.608
- All right, come on. Hustle!
- Hustle!

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.042
She saw no reason to take
part in childish pursuits.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.080
And her little interest in
the banal activities of youth,

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.129
her high-minded sensibility

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.248
guided Linda
to her life's purpose.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.850
I thought you said
she was going to the library.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.521
No. No, she sucks...

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.486
She would devote herself
to igniting the flames...

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.840
Hi, joanna.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.924
Of literary passion
in young minds.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.288
She nurtured their ideals...

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.164
How do communities
approach change

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.805
when promoted
by the individual?

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.888
Valued their opinions.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.365
Melissa.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.642
They adored her.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.967
But her uncompromising spirit,

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.969
so beloved in the classroom

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.287
doomed her
to a spinster's life.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:43.487
Linda?

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.250
Hi.
Hello.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.761
I'm don. It's so nice to meet you.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:47.801
You too.
Sorry.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.002
Oh, it's okay.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.248
Oh, I... well, you
ordered without me...

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.850
Oh, I'm...
I'm sorry.

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.487
No, I wasn't really offended.
I was just making a joke.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.841
For how could she
be a model to her students,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.162
if she settled
forjust any man?

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.520
Now I'm unemployed.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.530
And that's actually...
It's kinda great.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.123
I have a lot of time,
I stopped drinking ice.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.846
I grew a mustache.
And, uh...

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.327
When I was divorced this whole
patch just fell right into place.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.205
And I feel like I'm me now.

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.244
And, uh... I might have some
ice, actually. Could I...

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.364
She longed for
a sensitive, thoughtful man.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:28.370
Do you really need to make
35-40,000 dollars a year

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.369
with no chance
of being fired,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.848
just to teach some kids how to clap
their hands and run around in a circle?

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.203
I mean, physical education, that ought
to be up to the parents, right?

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.322
So what do you
teach again? French?

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.011
Someone mature,
and soft-spoken.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.248
Your system
doesn't work, Linda.

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.931
It's gasping for air.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.565
And you know what...

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.524
Let it die. This is
common sense... hi.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:53.290
Thanks.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.561
Do you mind
getting this one?

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.768
'Cause I'm a little
short on cash.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.882
Thank you, Linda.
I mean...

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.604
In the end, Linda
gave up on men altogether.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.200
Why can't we get back
to, like, the Indian days...

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.606
You know, "you give me
a piece of corn..."

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.245
"All right,
I'll help you..."

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.050
She loved her work,
she earned her keep.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.083
Debate! Debate! Debate!

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.043
That was enough.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.491
What a country...

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.171
And if there was a tragic air

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.726
about our stoic Ms. sinclair,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.080
so be it.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.882
If literature had
taught her anything,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:29.080
it was that the true
romantic is always alone.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.441
And must ever be on guard

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.722
against a dangerous world.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.086
Hey.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.362
Ow! Fuck! Ow!

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.005
Oh! Fuck!

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.726
It's me! Jason Sherwood!
I was in your class in 2006...

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.446
Ah!
Jason Sherwood?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.086
Yeah.
What are you doing here?

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.202
I thought you lived
in New York.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.806
No, I don't anymore...

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.766
Oh. Oh, my gosh...
Lam so sorry. Oh...

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.159
Let me take
you to the hospital.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.446
No. I'm fine...
Jason, I insist.

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.925
We have to take you
to the emergency room...

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.969
No, no, no... Jesus,
please, no, no, no. No.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:06.764
It's fine. I'm fine.
I'm sorry...

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.809
Ah! My Dad,
he works at the hospital

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:10.761
and I'd really rather not see him.
Okay, okay.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:12.410
Then let's get
you home, all right.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.045
God, that burns
like a fuck!

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.605
It burned my face!
I know. I'm so sorry...

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.411
I'm so sorry... come on,
my car is right over here.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.330
Oh, Jesus... who uses
pepper spray in Kingston?

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.682
You know, I have a clean
towel in the trunk,

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.768
I could get that for you.
No that's okay.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.120
This is working fine.

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.805
I am so, so sorry.

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.251
Oh, don't be sorry.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.124
It's my fault, I shouldn't
have startled you like that.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.680
No, no, you were
just being friendly,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.762
I should have
recognized you right away.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.441
Jason Sherwood. What are you doing
back here in Kingston, Pennsylvania?

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.369
I thought you'd be tearing
up Broadway by now!

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.970
Yeah. Not quite.

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.287
Well, you know,
it's only a matter of time.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.210
You were one of the best writers
I've ever had in my class.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.446
Aw, that's nice.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:59.289
So what's going on, really?

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.528
The last I heard you were in the
playwriting program in nyu.

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.727
Is that right?

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.205
Dramatic writing.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.322
Yeah, I got my degree
a couple of years ago.

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.165
And?
Don't keep me in suspense.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.725
And nothing.

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:12.251
That's it.
I'm done with writing.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.243
What?
What do you mean?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.890
I mean, I'm finished.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.083
I wrote my thesis play.
But that took me forever...

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.526
But I don't know,
I really believed in it.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.449
Well, of course you did.
What happened?

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.085
I tried to get it produced.

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.124
And used every resource
I had just to get it read.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:29.004
Right.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.487
Here, you can just keep going straight.
I'm staying with my Dad.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.649
For now. Well, what does
he think of all of this?

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.768
Uh, well. You don't
really know my Dad...

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.769
Oh, I do, a little.
He goes to my gym.

00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:41.360
Oh, that's funny.
Urn...

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.403
Well, he said I should
go to law school.

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.760
Oh, no...
Yeah.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.370
So I'm probably
gonna do that.

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.851
Oh, Jason...

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.564
I can't write.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:51.728
Honestly, it makes me
physically ill.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:55.561
And besides, I have to do something,
and law school's something.

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.365
You can make a left
at the next block.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.365
Right here.

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.840
Home sweet home. Thank you.
Mmm-hmm.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:08.564
I am so sorry.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.648
Oh, it's fine.
Don't worry about it.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.567
Jason, if I can do anything
to help, you know...

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:18.411
I'd love to read
your play at least.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.646
Yeah, sure.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.406
Uh, I could
drop it by school.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.443
All right.
Yeah?

00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.562
Okay. Bye, Ms. sinclair.
Thank you.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.180
Bye.

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.243
Thanks.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.090
It was the best of times.
It was the worst of times.

00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:45.131
It was time
to hand in your quizzes.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.280
So now that I know that you've all
finished a tale of two cities,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.210
let's talk about
Sydney carton's death.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.607
Now why would
he switch places

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:59.451
with a man condemned
to the guillotine?

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:01.847
Why does he
sacrifice himself?

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.970
Fallon.

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.809
I think it's really
cool, you know.

00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.445
'Cause he does it
for lucie.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.331
Even though she married another
guy, he still loves her so much

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.244
that he'll die
to save her husband.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.728
It's...
It's totally unselfish.

00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:19.968
Very nice. Yes?

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:21.923
Ms. sinclair? Have you
ever written anything?

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.963
Like a novel or a
play or something?

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:27.163
No. No, I'm not a writer.

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.806
I'm a reader.
And we need plenty of those.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.287
I think it is
only a true artist

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.080
who can give voice
to the human experience.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.410
Yes, will.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.490
I'm sorry, but if dickens
was such an artist,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.364
couldn't he come up
with an ending

00:09:43.480 --> 00:09:45.847
where this guy doesn't
have to kill himself?

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.883
I think you're
missing the point.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.368
Sydney carton's death is, as
fallon said, a selfless act.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:54.000
The only satisfaction
he receives is knowing

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.884
that he dies
for a noble cause.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.526
Now this is something that people
understood in dickens time.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.723
Today we've lost touch
with classical virtues,

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.287
like honor,
selfless action,

00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:07.880
the purity of a love
that asks for no reward...

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:11.366
Oh! Hi!

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:13.323
Oh, my goodness.
Sorry to interrupt.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.204
- No, no, no. Come on in.
- No, no, no...

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.810
Everyone's gonna be
so excited to meet you.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:18.041
No, no, no.
Please, please. No.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:20.561
Class, I have
a surprise for you.

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:24.082
This is Jason Sherwood.
He's a former student,

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.569
and a graduate of the dramatic
writing program at nyu.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:32.202
And I'm sure many of you remember
reading his wonderful story,

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.560
the hidden court.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:35.364
Oh.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.931
Sorry about that.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.565
Urn, I just came
to drop this off...

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.364
Oh, that's terrific.
Thank you so much.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.051
You're welcome to join us.
Oh, no, I'm okay.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.640
I'm just gonna go.

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.047
You guys should feel very lucky to
have Ms. sinclair as a teacher.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.044
I had many genius
writing teachers at nyu,

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.645
and she's up there
with the best.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.488
Thank you.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:58.100
Bye.
Goodbye.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.686
Okay, I admit it.
I bribed him to say that.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.002
All right, noble sacrifice.

00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:24.048
Dr. Sherwood!
Yeah.

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.083
I saw your son today.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:28.567
Uh, I'm Linda sinclair.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:30.364
I was Jason's English teacher...
Yeah, I know who you are.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.403
Yeah, Jason's back home.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:34.682
He told me all about New York.
It's very sad.

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:37.121
Well...

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.526
You know, I think he just reached a
point where he felt like he had to stop

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.608
and take stock of things.
It's very normal.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.961
But it would be such a shame for
him to give up his writing.

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:44.764
Because he's
so very talented.

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.446
Yeah. But that's a very,
very tough racket, you know.

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.130
Not everyone's
cut out for it.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.811
I'm excited
to read his play.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.285
He showed you his play? Yes.

00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.004
I'm very excited
to read it.

00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.084
I hope you like it.
Well, I'm sure I will.

00:11:58.200 --> 00:11:59.770
Did you like it'?

00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:03.606
I can't exactly say
it was my thing.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.970
Nice to see you, Mrs... Miss.

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:08.605
Miss sinclair.

00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:12.570
Ms. sinclair.

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.841
Right.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.761
I'm
calling from the...

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.009
No, thank you. And please
take me off your list.

00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.929
This will only take a second.
Thank you very much.

00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.962
Ma'am? Ma'am?

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.444
Yo?

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.450
Jason? It's Linda sinclair.
Did I wake you?

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:35.040
What? No.
No, no, no, no. Hi.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.042
Hi.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.567
How are you?
What's up?

00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.967
Well, I read the play.

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:42.804
You did?

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.729
And it's fantastic!

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.888
You like it?

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.729
Ilovediﬂ.

00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.405
It's remarkable!

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.249
I've been crying
for the last half hour.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:53.566
You have?

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.882
Are you kidding?
With that ending?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.800
I mean how can you even think about
law school, you belong in New York.

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.204
That's so nice
of you to say.

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.084
No, no.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.123
I'm not being nice.
I'm being honest.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.800
And I can't bear the thought that
no one's gonna get to see this.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.601
Yeah, me too. I mean, that's
just the way it is though.

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:15.131
You know, uh,
it's fine, you know...

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.203
I'll be a lawyer.

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.085
I just...
I have to let it go.

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.602
But what if there were
a way to get it produced.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.642
Right now.

00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.000
Would you be
interested in that?

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.606
I mean, honestly,
there isn't...

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.166
Because... do you
remember Carl kapinas?

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.090
Mr. ka-penis,
the drama teacher?

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.168
Jason, please,
he's a friend.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.203
Sorry. Kapinas.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.163
Well, he's always
complaining about

00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:46.648
having to direct the same
show year after year

00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:48.967
and I wanna give him
the chrysalis.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:51.481
Yeah, well, I'm...

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:54.843
I'm not sure really how I
feel about that exactly.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.964
Because if he flips for
it, like I know he will...

00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.680
There's a very real chance that he
could mount a production of it.

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.042
- You mean at the high school?
Mmm-hmm.

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.645
God damn it.

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:10.330
With him directing?

00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:12.408
That's right.

00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:14.841
Okay, I know that, you
know, Carl's a character.

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.485
He can come on a little strong, you know...
But say what you will,

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.841
the man understands drama.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.689
Linda,
are you in there?

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.320
Lin... sorry.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:26.563
- Linda'?
- Carl.

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:28.648
Can you wait a minute?

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.604
I can't wait. I've just had the
most transcendent experience!

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:33.210
Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you.
I heard you.

00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.885
Hurry!
Okay.

00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:38.403
Oh, Linda... Linda...

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.204
Oh, you liked it?
Liked it?

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.651
It's my story.

00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.886
The boy wrote it for me.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.002
I know! I felt
exactly the same way!

00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.083
Naturally.
The tale is archetypal,

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.880
and thus universal in it's appeal.
Mmm-hmm.

00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.201
Of course. Oh, but
it's so extraordinary.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.129
I feel I've been
transformed...

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:55.208
Wait... we should use
that for the posters.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:59.245
"The chrysalis will transform
you." Period. "Forever."

00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:00.885
Exclamation point.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.760
Linda, I'll do such
fantastic things with it.

00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.729
I see it all
so clearly up here.

00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.002
Ah, for the design,
I'm picturing a sort of

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:10.010
Neo-edwardian-German
expressionist gestalt.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.610
But colorful and fun.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.245
And I've already cast it.

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.323
Halle Anderson would make
an ideal lead. Oh, yes.

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:18.569
And Sheila Nussbaum
as the Irish stepmother.

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:20.250
Oh! She excels at dialect.

00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:22.169
The timing
couldn't be better.

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:24.647
I've harvested a bountiful and
talented crop of actors this year!

00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:26.728
Do you really
think we can do it?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.002
Oh, we can.
And we must.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.720
Don't you see?

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:33.729
I've become
an artistic zombie,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.121
walking lifelessly through
the same old productions

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.322
year after year
after year.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.602
I'm supposed to direct the
importance of being earnest

00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.808
this semester
for the fifth time.

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.207
Try breathing life into
that antiquated sitcom.

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.924
And how can I,
after reading this play?

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.169
This is O'Neill meets
kafka meets Spielberg

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.805
and then they all
walk into a bar.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.003
It's fresh!
It's new! It's...

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.280
It's not gonna
happen, people.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:58.971
And why is that, Phil?

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.606
Because this is not
a high school play, Carl!

00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.451
What do you know about what is
and isn't a high school play?

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.847
I've done 38 productions.

00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.724
Thirty-eight
over 19 years!

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.251
Ibefieve
I'm the authority here.

00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.203
No one is questioning your authority.
Oh, yeah.

00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.129
All Phil is saying...
Phil would be happy

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.322
if we put on our town
twice a year.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.727
Sue me, I like our town. I think
it's wholesome.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.848
Everybody likes it. I...
Just for me...

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.008
I thought, "oh..."

00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.283
I thought we were doing the importance
of being earnest as the play.

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.448
Trudie, if I have to
spend another two months

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.523
making trays
of cucumber sandwiches,

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.086
I will curl into a fetal
position and die.

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.601
Yeah, this is gonna be another
one of your debacles,

00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.405
like that time you did Oklahoma
with those idiotic masks.

00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.364
It was in the traditional
Japanese Noh style,

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:44.211
for your information.
Oh.

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.926
And Lydia plotke at the times leader
called it "profoundly imaginative."

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.724
Yeah, well, I thought
it profoundly stank.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.320
This from a man who
thinks American buffalo

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.680
is about
an American buffalo.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:54.245
That's what it's called!

00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:56.169
Well, in the words of
David mamet, "fuck you!"

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.930
Hey, ya, pal!

00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:59.530
Now time out!

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.642
Now just dial it down
a notch.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:03.325
I'm sorry.

00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:04.441
Accepted.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.407
Now as for this play,
the chrysalis.

00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.842
You know, I am impressed by
what this alumnus has written,

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.689
but I have to wonder...

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.804
You know, Is it
appropriate for a high school audience?

00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:19.160
Yes.
Right.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:21.442
- What will the parents think?
- Exactly.

00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:23.528
Can we clear it
before the board?

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:25.847
I'm sorry, what's the
actual issue here?

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.885
Hello? Have you read the thing?

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.889
It's got language,
it's got violence...

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.241
Obviously we'd tone
all of that down.

00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.486
That goes without saying.

00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:36.568
No, no...
We can talk about it...

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:39.445
Not to mention the cost, with all
these crazy special effects,

00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:41.369
and, you know,
costumes.

00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.882
Plus that girl who turns
herself into a bug-monster...

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.923
What is that?
This is not Broadway.

00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:48.405
I'm painfully
aware of that.

00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:51.046
We are dealing
with a limited budget.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.764
But this is about
more than money.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:54.723
This is about the kids.

00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.888
Think about of how
thrilled they'll be

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.843
to perform the work of a playwright
who used to be one of them.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.849
You want to sell the board?
You want to sell the parents?

00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.531
Then sell them
on Jason Sherwood,

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.041
a former Kingston high
school student who came back

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.401
to inspire
the next generation.

00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.010
It's a great story,

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.441
and I think I know a little
something about great stories.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:15.205
We'll double
normal ticket sales.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:17.971
You'll see the people of Kingston
are hungry for something new.

00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.764
And if it does come down
to money, I'll tell you this.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.764
If we go one penny over budget,
I'll pay for it myself.

00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.081
Out of my own pocket.

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.771
That's how much
I believe in this play.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.484
Phil,
what do you think?

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.806
All right. Okay.
Hold on now.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.285
We haven't talked
about the ending.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:32.401
What about the ending?

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.524
Oh, it's dark.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.644
"Dark"? Trudie,
it's a teenage girl

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.923
who hangs herself and then her Dad
blows his freakin' brains out!

00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:43.451
You can't do that
on a high school stage!

00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:46.131
But everything
hinges on the ending!

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.044
It's poetry.
Lfslbsenl.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.527
It's a lawsuit
waiting to happen!

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.529
The ending would have to change.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.809
All right.

00:19:57.920 --> 00:19:59.160
We'll cut the ending.
What?

00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.566
What?
We'll cut it.

00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.488
Leave it ambiguous.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:04.889
Yes. Yes, it could
heighten the mystery.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.604
Leave it open
to interpretation.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:07.482
I like it.

00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:10.206
Would Jason
agree to that?

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.970
I'm sure he understands,
as we all do,

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.048
that one must be flexible
in the name of theater.

00:20:15.080 --> 00:20:17.048
I want it in writing.

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:19.891
Oh! God, I'll have to start the auditions
by Friday, assemble my crew...

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.968
Carl. Carl! So much to
do, so little time.

00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:24.481
But when the inspiration is
there, it hardly seems like work.

00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:26.682
Carl! We can't cut the
ending, we just can't.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.484
It's gonna ruin
the play, it'll kill it!

00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.807
Relax.
No! I won't relax.

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.524
I mean... how am I supposed
to explain this to Jason?

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:34.563
Very simply.
Don't.

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:37.081
Because we're not going to cut it.
We're not'?

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.363
No, I just said that to get the
go-ahead from der fuhrer and his wife.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.164
That's how it works
in show business.

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.931
Itdoes? Keep it
moving at all costs.

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.328
Believe me, when the entire audience
is bawling on opening night,

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:51.489
even that sub-cretin Phil
will give it his blessing.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.125
Really?
Really.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:56.004
I give you my word.

00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.565
It's a game, Linda.

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.648
And I know
how to play it.

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.090
Hi. Sorry, I'm late.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.567
Oh, my goodness. You must be freezing!
Oh, I'm fine.

00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:30.648
Let's get you some
coffee to warm up. Okay?

00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:33.246
Oh, no. I don't want coffee.
I have an ulcer.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.522
Oh, some herbal tea, then.
No, no, no. That's fine.

00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:37.762
I don't... I don't
really want anything.

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.609
How long have
you had an ulcer?

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.042
Urn, since, uh... since
New York, actually.

00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.049
Since this play.

00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.242
Urn, speaking
of which...

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.209
Ah, yes! The play!
The play's the thing.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.044
Urn... all right.
Here's the contract.

00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:53.401
Well, it's not really a contract,
it's more like an informal agreement

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.284
that Phil pelaski drew up.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.243
Urn... all it says is that you
grant the high school the right

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:59.249
to mount a production
of your play.

00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:01.920
I just need your signature right
here, and then we're good to go.

00:22:09.360 --> 00:22:11.408
Everything okay?

00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.327
Urn...

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.085
I don't want
to be difficult, um...

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.362
And I know
you're only trying to help,

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:24.724
but this is not exactly a high
school play that I've written...

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.285
Well, I understand that.

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.249
And as much
as I want it produced,

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:31.165
believe me, I do, I would just
rather it be not made at all,

00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:32.481
than be made badly.

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.807
Well, Carl and I feel
exactly the same way.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.968
I...

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:39.401
I just don't
think I can do it.

00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.642
Do you want
your father to win?

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:48.761
What?

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:51.366
I'm not stupid.
I read the play.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.289
I know where
this came from.

00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.209
Your father doesn't
understand you, fine.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:56.970
He doesn't
support you, fine...

00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.447
He'd say he does...
Well, financially, yes.

00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:01.642
Paying for law school.
He'll encourage you,

00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:04.286
but only if you do
what he wants you to do.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.687
Don't give in to him, Jason!
Prove him wrong.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.686
Well, what if
he's not wrong?

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:12.484
You know, you've just lost
confidence, that's all.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.125
Yeah.
That can happen.

00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:16.320
That can happen to any artist.
But if you do this...

00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.560
You're gonna get it back.
I promise you.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:39.167
I feel like I'm signing
my soul away.

00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:41.044
Ja, herr faust!

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:43.208
It's all mine.

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:49.323
Sheila Nussbaum will be
playing the role of Margaret,

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.642
the cruel Irish stepmother.

00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:54.445
Sheila's been working on her
Irish, haven't you, Sheila?

00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.722
I'll meet ya
at the pub on grafton street,

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:58.171
ya bloody eejit!

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.290
Will traynor will play
Dr. Tim sherman,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.890
the cold,
alcoholic father.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.048
Yo.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.607
Fallon Hughes will play our
heroine's deceased mother, ariadne,

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.769
who haunts our tale
as the spectral moth queen.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.526
And last,
but certainly not least,

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.531
Halle Anderson will be
miss Jane sherman,

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:22.887
our sensitive,
misunderstood ingenue.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.240
Hi.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.203
And now, Mr. Sherwood,
may I say on behalf

00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.721
of the entire Kingston
high theater department

00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.569
it is an honor
to have you with us.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:34.207
And I know we have questions,
questions, questions.

00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.805
So, who wants to begin?

00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.521
Halle.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:43.444
Your play really captures what it
feels like to be a teenage girl,

00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:46.564
not knowing who you are, and
wondering if anyone gets you.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:49.570
And I want to be as real
as I can in my performance,

00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.881
so it would really help me to
know where Jane came from.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:55.127
What inspired you?

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.730
You know, well...

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.723
Everything I've written,

00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.407
everything my characters
experience, is authentic.

00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:03.521
Urn...

00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:06.251
Yep! It all happened
to me in my life.

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.806
It's all something I've lived
through at some point.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:11.287
It's a very,
very personal story.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.687
Anyone else have questions?
Yeah.

00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.802
Urn, on page 52,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.844
when Tim is having
that big fight with Jane?

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.483
Do you really think it's
necessary for him to hit her?

00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.524
I mean, isn't the whole point
that he's too repressed

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.449
to show any emotion?

00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.846
It just seems kind of...

00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:37.605
Kind of what?

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.245
Well, I don't know.

00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.607
Trite.
Oh, really, will...

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:43.480
Is that necessary?

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.367
Uh, yeah...
I'm sorry.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.208
- Oh, dear lord.
- Will?

00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:56.481
Will, what is wrong
with you?

00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.523
What'd I do?

00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:00.244
Do you know how lucky you are, to
workshop with the actual playwright?

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.925
Jason is our honored guest.

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:04.327
And if you can't treat him
with the respect he deserves,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.250
then maybe we can find someone
else to star in his play.

00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.930
Is that what you'd like?

00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.520
No. I
didn't think so.

00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:13.290
Did you take
your ritalin today?

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.849
Forget it. I think this
was a very big mistake.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:23.281
I shouldn't have even...
I'm so sorry...

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:25.846
I am not going let some high school
smartass tell me that my work is trite!

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.691
Of course not. You know what,
he's testing boundaries.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.080
I deal with
this stuff every day.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.366
You have to,
it's your job.

00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.720
I don't have to be doing this!
No, you don't.

00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:33.841
You don't have
to do any of this.

00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:35.849
We so appreciate
you being here,

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.849
and the kids are so excited,
and they love your play.

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.724
No, they don't. Yes, they do.
They love it.

00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.922
And they'd be crushed
if you pulled out now.

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:45.328
Not what's-his-name. Mr. trite.
Will? What...

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.442
He's intimidated by you.
Oh, come on.

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:49.005
He's a kid!

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.889
He's just an insecure kid
in Kingston, Pennsylvania.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.525
And you're
a New York playwright.

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.846
Are you really going
to let him get to you?

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.689
I think you're
stronger than that.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.041
And, Jason,
your work is brilliant.

00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:04.210
Thank you. I'm sorry if
I'm overreacting a little bit,

00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.244
I don't really know how to react to criticism.
No, no. Do not.

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:10.045
It's easy to feel discouraged,
but you shouldn't be.

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.889
Not with something
like that.

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:15.523
We're back.
Good.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.007
Uh, let's all rejoin
the circle, shall we?

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.281
I apologize for that.
No, no, no...

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:27.084
It's will, right?

00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:31.484
Yeah. Look, man, I'm
sorry about what I said.

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.410
No, don't be sorry.
I am...

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.885
I'm glad you brought it up.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:40.331
You're right.
Tim is repressed.

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:43.330
He's spent his whole life
bottling up everything he feels.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.010
That's why he hates
Jane so much.

00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:48.044
Because she represents
everything he isn't.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:50.049
She is wide open,

00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:53.926
she actually feels things,
she can't hold back.

00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:55.485
So when he hits her,
it's like all the rage

00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.688
he's been suppressing over the
years finally boils over,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.961
and when it happens,

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.082
if it plays
the way it should,

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:02.040
it will not be trite.

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.920
Does that answer
your question?

00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.090
Urn... yeah.

00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:11.321
Thanks.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.441
Yeah.

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:14.607
Any other comments?

00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:17.923
Wonderful.
Let's move on.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:22.563
As many of you know, I too was
once a budding young actor.

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.648
Shocking, I know.

00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:26.842
The year was 1983.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:29.964
I was living in a fifth
floor walk-up on Avenue c,

00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.889
waiting for my big break.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.844
And then one day I was
called in to audition

00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.885
for that living God
of theater himself,

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.081
Mr. Stephen sondheim.

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:44.842
And though
I wasn't ultimately cast,

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:47.964
I did receive a blessing
from the great man himself,

00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:52.005
who took me aside and said three
little words that changed my life.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.161
"Keep at it."

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.846
Well, I did keep at it,

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:03.045
and that's how I found my way here,
to Kingston, and to all of you.

00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:05.640
And now, as we embark on that...

00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.366
Tough but oh-so-rewarding
road ahead,

00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:11.643
I would like to honor Mr. sondheim
with a humble blessing of my own...

00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:14.320
And if our young documentarian
would care to commence filming...

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.560
Okay, hit it, George.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.043
I” bit by bit,
putting it together

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.004
I piece by piece, the only
way to make a work of art

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:36.009
I every moment
makes a contribution

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.083
I every little detail
plays a part.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:39.690
"I piece by piece... j"

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:42.644
I hate you
worse than your bleedin' da!

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.365
Shut your
mouth, you stupid girl!

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.448
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:53.130
Let me hear it
one more time.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:54.730
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl!

00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.968
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.649
All the trees.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.569
The trees I like.

00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.887
Watch, watch. If a
tree falls in a hallway...

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.561
The entire world.

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.041
Shut your
mouth, you stupid girl!

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.083
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.406
Carl, could I have a word?

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.170
Mmm-hmm.

00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:21.122
Urn...

00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.762
It seems to me... and Carl...
Jason, uh, correct me if I'm wrong

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.571
that Margaret might
be a tad more menacing

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.921
if she were just
a tiniest bit more subdued.

00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.565
Yes. Thank you.

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.683
You mean like Amanda
in the glass menagerie?

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.770
Dominating her children,
but with a deceptive softness.

00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.450
The velvet glove
and the iron grip.

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:44.601
Exactly.

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:47.885
Hmm... interesting.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:51.480
Let's try it.

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.125
Sheila,
I have an idea.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.810
That's a good note.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.481
Shut your mouth,
you stupid girl.

00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.602
I hate you worse
than your bleedin' da!

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:06.721
Jason!

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.726
Oh, shit.

00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:11.928
I don't believe this.

00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.963
I need to talk to you outside.
Let's go.

00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.606
Excuse me, but you can't just
barge in here like this.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.285
We are rehearsing.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.164
Excuse me, I'm gonna
talk to my son. Now!

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.681
Let's go! Uh, no. I don't
think you understand...

00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.131
Ms. sinclair,
it's fine.

00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:26.049
Just go on without me, please.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.808
Go on without me, guys.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:30.967
I'll be right back.

00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:36.965
Is he gonna be okay?

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.764
Perhaps not.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.245
But all great art
comes from pain.

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.689
Remember that.

00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:00.805
Making such a crazy
scene right now!

00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:02.684
What is going on here?

00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:04.723
This is really none
of your business.

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.171
This is my school. And when I
see someone being manhandled,

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:07.839
it is my business.
Now wait a second...

00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.729
No, no.
You wait a second!

00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.842
For two weeks, your son's
worked his fingers to the bone,

00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:13.405
challenging himself in ways that
any parent would be proud of.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.359
And you finally show up,
and what do you do...

00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.124
Do you show
any appreciation?

00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.850
No! You drag him
from rehearsal.

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.291
You accost him!

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.761
Ms. sinclair.
With all due respect,

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.968
you have no idea
what's going on here.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.930
On the contrary. I know
exactly what's going on.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.367
What... what are you talking about?
What is she talking about?

00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.005
I've dealt with men like him
before, the Alpha male.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.248
You may fool most people,
but you don't fool me.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.203
You know what, I'm not gonna
listen to this, okay?

00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:37.243
I don't wanna hear this. I've
got to be at the hospital.

00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:38.202
No, you do need to hear this!
Oh, all right then, go. Go!

00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:40.163
But know this,
you cannot stop this play!

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.045
Jason will have the life
he deserves, as an artist!

00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:45.049
Fine!

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.288
Oh. Oh, Jason...
It's my ulcer.

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.367
It's totally fine.
Here.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.170
All right. Okay.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.930
Let's get back inside,
all right?

00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:53.121
Let's get you inside.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.321
Oh, no.
Thank you.

00:32:56.520 --> 00:32:59.046
Come on in. I think
I have something for you.

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.321
Oh, where is it,
where is it?

00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.728
I forgot my pills at home. Okay.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.242
Oh... oh, I found it.

00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.361
Okay.
Oh.

00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.926
This is still okay.

00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:14.166
Okay.

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.404
It'll be gone
in like 10 minutes.

00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:21.282
Okay.
Here you go.

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:28.722
Oh...

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.924
Thank you.

00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:36.281
I'm just glad
I had that bottle.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.249
No, I mean thank you for
what you did outside.

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.767
For standing up
to him like that.

00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:41.961
Well, you know what?

00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.764
He's a bully,

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.291
and someone needs to tell
him that he's wrong.

00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:47.289
Yeah.

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.971
Well, he's been doing
that ever since my mother...

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.800
Jason“.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.520
I'm so sorry.

00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.520
I am so, so sorry.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.851
It's okay.

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:17.488
He's an asshole.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.364
I know. I know.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.925
I know.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.328
Mmm.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.460
Oops, sorry.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.327
Okay.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.124
I'm going to, uh,
head home now.

00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:19.740
Okay.

00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:23.960
And we'll talk a little later.
Mmm-hmm.

00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:45.040
What had she done?

00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.003
What had she done?

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.490
Of course
these things do happen.

00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.967
The pages of literature
were filled with such affairs.

00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.447
It was only natural that
feelings would arise and...

00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:03.483
Spill over.

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:16.929
Surely no one would judge her
for such a minor indiscretion.

00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.125
Linda, dear.

00:36:33.240 --> 00:36:36.449
I have a somewhat
delicate matter

00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.130
to discuss with you.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.765
What? What is it?

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:41.484
Jason and I were
talking and...

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:47.611
We agree that the backdrop
in the moth queen's lair,

00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:50.451
the Scarlet organza has
more oomph than the voile,

00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:53.689
but it puts us
a tiny bit over budget.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.201
I hate to ask
but you did say...

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.367
How much?

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.444
We shall hang
a plaque in your honor.

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:04.040
Don't worry about it,
Carl, it's fine.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.321
I feel like if I had a
cane, I'd look more regal.

00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.965
Hey, Ms. sinclair.
Hello, will.

00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:13.526
Hey, did you speak to
kapinas about the backdrop?

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:17.167
Yes! Yes,
I spoke with Carl.

00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:19.521
May I have a private
word with you?

00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.086
Yes. Sure.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.248
Shall we?
Please excuse us, will.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.600
Okay.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.041
We can, uh, talk in here. Sure.

00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:39.610
Now, we're both adults.

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.564
And while it is possible
for people of different ages

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:44.569
to have a meaningful
relationship...

00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:46.842
Sure.
I think...

00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:49.850
It is best that
what happened,

00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.962
uh, does not
happen again.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.362
Not that we did anything wrong.
No. Not at all.

00:37:56.480 --> 00:37:58.482
Because of the play...
The, um...

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.365
We must be professional.

00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.209
The play requires
complete commitment

00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:05.482
with no distractions
and no complications.

00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:07.329
Absolutely. 100%.

00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.283
And as a playwright, you
need to keep a clear head

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:10.481
from now on in.

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.082
Right. Because the
play's the thing.

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.406
Yes! The play
is the thing.

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.521
The play's the thing.
Yes!

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:18.091
I'm glad
you're in agreement.

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:20.567
So we're still friends?

00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:22.640
Oh, Jason, of course.
No. Of course we're friends.

00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.290
I was just worried for a second.
No, no, no.

00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.845
You don't need
to be worried.

00:38:25.960 --> 00:38:27.007
You have more important
things to worry about,

00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:30.442
like whether or not will nails
that funeral speech in act two.

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.131
Right. Because he always loses
focus in the middle. He does.

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.727
Yes, he does, so you should
get out there and, um...

00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.649
And work on that, so... yeah.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:41.240
Well, I might
need your help.

00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.249
Well, all right
then, um...

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.361
You will have it.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:46.602
Thank you.
Let's do it!

00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.246
Urn, well, no. Let's, uh,
we'll go out, and... yeah.

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.565
Excuse me.

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:08.960
Hi.

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:11.367
Just so you know...

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:13.608
Just for the record
I did not go to the school

00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.051
because of the play.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.605
I was there because
Jason lied to me.

00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.484
Dr. Sherwood, I'm not interested.
No, no, no.

00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:20.401
Just so you know...
On Tuesdays and Thursdays,

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:23.290
he's supposed to be taking
lsat prep test up in Scranton.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:25.801
He told me that these rehearsals
would in no way interfere with that,

00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.730
and now I find out not only he's been
skipping the classes altogether,

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.126
but he lied to me.
Oh, come on!

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:31.366
You expect me to believe this?
Oh, no.

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.050
Yeah, I do.
Look. Look.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.605
He sent this to me an hour
before I saw you yesterday.

00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.769
"Hi, Dad. On my way
to lsat prep class."

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:39.120
"Be back later tonight."

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:42.643
You see that, right?

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:45.127
Well, if he lied,

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:48.005
it's because he feels
he has no choice.

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.488
How can he trust you?
You are crushing his spirit.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.045
How am I
crushing his spirit?

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.650
Forcing Jason to go
to law school is like...

00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:56.649
Like using a Shakespeare
folio for toilet paper.

00:39:56.760 --> 00:39:59.969
"Forcing him!" I've never
forced Jason to do anything.

00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.242
Going to law school
was entirely his idea.

00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.646
I'm sure you're
begging him not to go.

00:40:03.760 --> 00:40:05.125
This is unbelievable.
Yes, it is.

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.599
You got me all
figured out, right.

00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.125
There's nothing I can say
that won't convince you

00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.480
I'm not a complete asshole?

00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.250
You know what
you could do?

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.646
You could start by
giving Jason the respect

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.001
and the freedom
that he deserves.

00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.645
Maybe I should stop
talking to him altogether?

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:19.007
Would that work for you? That
might be an improvement, yeah.

00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.719
Okay, you obviously
don't have any kids!

00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:23.246
Excuse me! Excuse me!

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.691
I have had
hundreds of kids,

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.245
and I have had
a lot of experience...

00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:28.044
Yeah, yeah, of course.
My mistake.

00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:30.003
Hey, I'm doing the best
that I can with Jason.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.771
Perhaps your best
isn't good enough.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:35.200
Is that what you tell
your students?

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:38.403
Oh, there is no comparison!
Do you know what'?

00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.487
You...

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.601
You are an asshole!

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:41.687
Huh?

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.211
Asshole.

00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.129
I'm a rascal?
I said...

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.845
Hello.

00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:00.247
It's Linda.
Do you have a minute?

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.885
Hey, Linda.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.525
I just ran into
your father and...

00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:04.727
Is that Ms. sinclair?

00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:06.888
Hi, Ms. sinclair!

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.207
Wait, look, urn...

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:12.051
Halle's over.
Urn, we're running lines.

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:13.889
Over? Are...

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.365
Are you still at school?

00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.608
Uh, no, my place.

00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.246
Uh, it just seemed easier.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:21.725
Uh, is everything okay?

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:24.081
Oh. Everything's fine.

00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.844
I'm sorry to interrupt.

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.564
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:28.761
Uh, okay.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.882
Uh, see you tomorrow.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.486
Bye, Ms. sinclair! Bye.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.410
Uh, shall we pick
it up where we left off'?

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:42.450
So with tax and shipping,

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.564
it comes to
$433.52 cents.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.449
That includes
the smoke machine

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.489
and the slightly more
expensive strobe light.

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:53.804
Oh, Carl, is all this
really necessary?

00:41:53.920 --> 00:41:56.161
Well, it is if you want the
magic of the play to work.

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:58.521
But if you're content to see
the chrysalis undermined

00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:00.483
by a cheap strobe
expeﬂence,

00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:02.284
I'll run out and buy two
flashlights and a lazy Susan.

00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.084
Oh, calm down,
I was only asking.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.321
Sorry.

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:12.923
Halle's doing spectacularly
well, don't you think?

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:14.491
Oh. Bless you.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.284
Stop.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:26.683
I can't believe Mr. Adams
gave us that quiz!

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.450
Halle...

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:30.648
May I speak with
you a moment, please?

00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.846
Take a seat.

00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:43.729
Well, first of all,

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:47.686
I want to tell you what a fantastic
job you're doing as Jane.

00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.690
Oh! Thanks. I've been
working my butt off,

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.404
but I love it.

00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:53.726
I know.

00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:55.251
That's why we're going
to have this talk.

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.247
I know how important
this play is to you,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.603
and I wouldn't want
anything to jeopardize that.

00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:01.643
Whoa, wait.
Am I in trouble?

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:04.007
No, no, no, no.
Everything's fine.

00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:04.882
It's just, um...

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:09.371
Well, um...

00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:11.528
It's about Jason.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:13.842
Some of us have noticed,

00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:16.008
uh, that your behavior
with him lately

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:17.849
has been a little
inappropriate.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.959
I haven't done anything.

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.849
I know, but appearances
are important.

00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.610
And people tend
to make assumptions.

00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.687
Well, they shouldn't!

00:43:23.800 --> 00:43:26.007
I know, I know.
But...

00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:26.928
They do.

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:33.406
Now, I understand that you
want to pursue acting

00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:35.045
as a career.
Is that true?

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.691
May I offer
you some advice?

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:41.370
As you go out
on auditions,

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:43.687
you'll be meeting a lot
of men, powerful men,

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.367
who may be interested in you for
reasons other than your talent.

00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:49.528
Now you're a very
attractive young woman,

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:52.081
and you may be tempted
to take advantage of that.

00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:54.202
In the short term,
that may work.

00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:57.688
But in the long term, people
might lose respect for you.

00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:00.883
And they may find
you a little, um, trashy.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.049
I know I sound harsh, but it's
only because I care about you,

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:06.891
and I want you to earn the respect
that you deserve as a woman,

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.765
not because of your body,
but because of your mind.

00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:13.601
And that is why you need
to stay away from Jason.

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:14.600
Am I making any sense?

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.730
It just seems really unfair.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.121
Guys can get away with
anything, but girls can't.

00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:25.730
I know. It is unfair.

00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:28.406
But, unfortunately, that's
the world in which we live.

00:44:28.520 --> 00:44:29.567
I wish it weren't.

00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:32.326
Oh, so do I.

00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:34.920
But I have learned
from experience that wishing

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.361
doesn't always make it so.

00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.844
Changing the world is hard
work, but we can do it.

00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:44.646
We women just have to stick
together, that's all.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.687
I'm so glad we had
this conversation.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:53.929
Go ahead to lunch, go on. And
I'll see you at rehearsal.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:55.530
Yeah.

00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.140
See ya.
Okay.

00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:10.043
And at $800, the fake
fireplace is a real bargain.

00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:14.168
Don't play
with that, fellas.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.042
Sorry.

00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.726
Oh, Linda,
what can I say.

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:23.491
You are like the Peggy guggenheim
of high school theater.

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:24.681
But prettier.

00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.841
Oh!

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.361
Oh! Ah!
I don't believe this.

00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:38.289
Linda. Just relax.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.890
She is a student, Jason.
Linda, Linda just hang on...

00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:41.804
What a scummy,
sleazy thing to do!

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.769
I know.
And you!

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:45.160
I expected better from you.

00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:47.009
I'm sorry.
No. It's too late.

00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:49.407
This is going on
your permanent record.

00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:51.488
Linda, just relax...

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:53.364
No. You, you can forget about
that letter of recommendation.

00:45:53.480 --> 00:45:55.005
What!
You can't do that!

00:45:55.120 --> 00:45:57.009
You've left me no choice.

00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.009
Linda.

00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.645
Linda! Oh my God. My parents
are going to kill me!

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:01.921
No, no, no. It's fine.

00:46:02.040 --> 00:46:03.644
Just sit down. Relax, okay.
No, they are!

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:04.966
I'm going to go take care of it...
Linda!

00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.162
What?

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.760
Hey, Linda.

00:46:09.880 --> 00:46:11.166
Can we talk
about this, please?

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:13.129
No. I don't need to
talk about anything.

00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:14.406
I know what I saw.

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.488
But we didn't do anything!
Oh, how dare you.

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.726
I catch you fooling
around with a student,

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:19.285
you have the audacity
to deny it?

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.640
She started it. I didn't start it.

00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:22.250
That is so
chivalrous of you.

00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.600
You know, you're a
role model to these kids.

00:46:23.720 --> 00:46:25.131
They look up to you!

00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:26.651
To take advantage
like that, that is...

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.046
Unconscionable!

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:29.969
I'm sorry.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.162
You know, I thought you were
serious about this play.

00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:33.611
I thought you were ready to be a
professional, but apparently not.

00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.047
Because this was
an amateur move, Jason.

00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:37.446
Amateur!

00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:38.561
This is bullshit.

00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:39.767
Excuse me?

00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:40.881
You're jealous!

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.204
As if I'd be jealous of some
dirty little make out session

00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:47.526
in the boys
dressing room.

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.404
No, you'd rather have a
quick fuck in the classroom

00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.488
with one of your old students!
Shh. Stop it!

00:46:51.600 --> 00:46:53.011
Is that what you want? You want me to
bend you over your desk right now?

00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.042
You are awful!
God knows you need it...

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.241
You are awful!

00:46:58.680 --> 00:46:59.806
Shit.

00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:01.843
Hit me with
a piece of fucking prop...

00:47:36.840 --> 00:47:38.569
Hello?

00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.205
Ma'am, I know
you like turtles...

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.926
Take me off your goddamn list,
and never call me again!

00:48:24.920 --> 00:48:27.651
Fallon Hughes.
Here.

00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.808
Ed mckee.
Ho.

00:48:32.240 --> 00:48:33.844
Benjamin meyer.

00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.610
Ho!

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:37.688
What is the matter
with you people?

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.490
Settle down.

00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:41.401
Or you're looking at detention!
Is that clear?

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:24.405
And 'cause the theme this
year is "winter dreamz,"

00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:28.161
I thought we could have giant
beds and snowmen in pj's...

00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:31.011
No, no, that is
a horrible idea.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:32.963
I need to talk.
Linda!

00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:35.560
Okay, joni, let's... let's
talk about it tomorrow.

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:37.205
But this is
"winter dreamz."

00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.361
Out.

00:49:41.440 --> 00:49:42.885
Something
terrible has happened...

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:44.968
I'll say.

00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.764
You can't go three feet in this
school without hearing about

00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:48.681
you and Shakespeare doing
it in the classroom!

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.285
Because Halle Anderson is spreading
vicious rumors about me,

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:57.450
and I just caught her defacing my
classroom door with obscenities!

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.688
Why would Halle do that?

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:00.807
Why?

00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:02.763
Because yesterday,
I caught her

00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:04.928
messing around with Jason Sherwood
in the boys dressing room!

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.087
That's why!

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.170
Ow! Ow...
Oh, God. Oh, God...

00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:10.247
You should
have told us.

00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:11.771
I gave her a warning.

00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.481
I just... I thought
that would be enough.

00:50:13.560 --> 00:50:15.449
I didn't expect
all this to happen.

00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:16.641
Tydical.

00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.649
You know, good teacher
let's a student off easy,

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:20.330
she turns around
and stabs her in the back.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:23.125
And him, messing around
with one of our kids,

00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:24.770
I'll knock
his block off!

00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:27.087
Where... where is Halle now?
In rehearsal?

00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:30.210
Yes, but I don't think...

00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:33.164
Do we really have to do this now?
In front of everyone?

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:34.850
I thought you'd just pull
her into your office.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.207
No. We've got to clean this mess
up before it gets any worse.

00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.971
These types of rumors can do real
damage to a teacher's reputation.

00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.890
Even one as sterling as yours.
But I'd really rather not...

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.321
Damn it, Linda. These punks
took advantage of you!

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.090
Now you got to look
them in the eye

00:50:47.200 --> 00:50:49.481
and tell them you're not going
to roll over for their b.S.

00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.004
You!

00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:53.645
And you! Get over
here, right now.

00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.683
You too, Carl.
You should hear this.

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.040
What's the meaning of this, Phil?
We're trying to rehearse.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:58.481
Yep. Well, rehearsal's
gonna wait.

00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.329
It seems
Romeo and Juliet here

00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:03.363
have been fooling around a little
bit after play practice, huh.

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:04.720
What on earth
are you talking about?

00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.080
And to top it all off,

00:51:06.240 --> 00:51:08.322
sweet little Juliet
has been spreading

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:10.599
some pretty nasty lies about
one of our best teachers.

00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.965
They're not lies!

00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:13.724
She's just jealous,
because he's with me now!

00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:14.921
So you admit it?
Oh, Christ.

00:51:15.080 --> 00:51:17.481
Oh, Halle, really?
It's true!

00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:19.443
She did him in her room.
Everyone knows!

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:21.164
Okay, now you listen.

00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.089
You are digging a very big
hole for yourself, right now.

00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:24.964
Where are you going, Halle?
You get back here, miss!

00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.127
Halle...

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:28.322
Hey, what's with
all the shouting?

00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:30.886
Oh. Traynor, what
the hell is that?

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.081
Oh, good lord.

00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:35.162
It's for my big
suicide at the end.

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:37.686
No, sir, it is not!

00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:39.165
Hey, we had an agreement!

00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.931
What? I'm sorry...
What agreement?

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.042
Ah, I can explain.

00:51:44.160 --> 00:51:47.448
Don't play dumb, Romeo. Now, you know
damn well we had to cut that ending!

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:48.402
What?

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:51.482
What? What?

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:52.965
I'm a little confused.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:53.848
Why are you even
rehearsing this ending?

00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:55.371
You trying to pull
one over on me, Carl? Huh?

00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:57.050
You want to get
yourself fired?

00:51:57.160 --> 00:51:59.401
You have it all wrong,
Phil, as usual.

00:51:59.520 --> 00:52:01.727
This is merely
an experiment.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:05.362
Yes. I wanted the actors to experience
the full darkness of Jason's play.

00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.562
But it was never my intention
to perform the ending.

00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.449
After all,
we did agree to cut it.

00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:13.360
Carl, what the hell? You never
said I had to cut the ending!

00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:14.766
You never said that.

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:17.087
But it wasn't
my place to tell you.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:19.320
It was my understanding that
Linda cleared it with you

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:21.727
when you signed the contract.
Carl. No.

00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.365
You knew?
Carl. No.

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:24.891
You knew?
No. No...

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.002
You did read the
contract, didn't you?

00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:29.726
She forced me to sign it,
without actually reading it.

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.410
You never told me I'd
have to cut the ending,

00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.045
because you knew I would
never agree to it!

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.089
No, no, no...
Linda, is this true?

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.440
No...

00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.050
No...
Is it true?

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:38.680
Is that true?

00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.567
Yes, but I can explain...

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:46.160
Because it's complicated...

00:52:46.280 --> 00:52:47.042
As if I'd be jealous of
some dirty little make out session

00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:49.083
in the boys
dressing room.

00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:51.089
No, you'd rather have a
quick fuck in the classroom

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:51.962
- with one of your old students.
- Shh. Stop it!

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.287
Is that what you want? You want
me to bend you over your desk?

00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:55.083
You're awful! You're awful!

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:55.800
Oh, my...
Wow...

00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:59.609
Oops.

00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:00.846
Told you.

00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.769
She's a lying old whore.

00:53:02.880 --> 00:53:05.406
She's, uh... where...
Linda, you're fired. Oh.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.249
You better run.
You hear me!

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.084
You are fired, lady!

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:11.208
Yeah, who's trashy now?

00:53:11.320 --> 00:53:13.448
Hey, Linda! Linda!

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:16.131
Leave me alone!
Don't run away from me.

00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:17.924
How could you lie
to me like that?

00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:19.206
I trusted you.

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:20.810
And you sat there
and you lied to my face!

00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.281
Get away, get away!
Oh! Fuck! No!

00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:25.323
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! No!

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.721
Not again!

00:53:29.680 --> 00:53:33.127
Fuck! I fucking
hate this school.

00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.087
Ma'am, you've been in an accident, okay.
You're in the hospital.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.406
Oh, God...

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.487
No, you're going
to be just fine.

00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:19.687
No, I won't.

00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.246
Yes, you will.
I promise.

00:54:22.360 --> 00:54:24.488
Oh. Hi, Dr. Sherwood.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:26.887
No, no, not him.
Someone else.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:28.889
Get me someone else, please.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.480
Honey, there's no one else unless
you want to wait a few hours.

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.164
I'll wait. I can wait.
Please...

00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:35.367
Urn, I...

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.562
Can you, uh,
excuse us, nurse?

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:38.841
Oh, sure.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:41.361
Um, I think
she's still in shock.

00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:42.720
Yeah.

00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.569
Don't worry, honey,
you're in good hands.

00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.602
This is awkward.

00:54:54.160 --> 00:54:56.288
It says here you
were in a car accident

00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.641
after you rubbed pepper
spray into your eyes?

00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:03.401
Wow...

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:07.723
Okay.

00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:09.569
Have you
any dizziness?

00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.011
No.
No?

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:13.571
Any nausea?
No.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.889
Neck pain?
Yes.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.206
Where?

00:55:20.560 --> 00:55:21.561
Up here?
Mmm-hmm.

00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.120
Does that hurt?

00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:27.922
Yeah...

00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:30.327
How severe, as if on a
scale of one to 10?

00:55:30.440 --> 00:55:33.603
I don't know.
Three? Five?

00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:35.688
What does that
question even mean?

00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.200
I don't know, it's something we
have to ask in the hospital.

00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.530
All right, let's take
a look at this.

00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.371
Okay.

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.927
It's going to sting.

00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:58.531
Well, that's not so bad.

00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.642
I'll have a nurse
clean this up.

00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:02.489
You're actually
a very lucky woman.

00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:04.409
I don't think you're
going to need stitches.

00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:19.086
Okay.

00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:22.762
Here you are, here...

00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:24.803
It's good to get
it out like that.

00:56:24.920 --> 00:56:27.082
Could you please leave'?

00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:31.128
Listen, you've been through
a very physical trauma.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:32.651
It's perfectly
normal to have...

00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.330
No, please.
Please...

00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:37.091
Honestly, emotional outbursts
like this are very common.

00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.248
Stop it. Stop being
so nice to me.

00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:42.330
You hate me.
I know you hate me.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.171
I don't hate you.
Ms. sinclair, listen...

00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:46.884
Hey.

00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:48.841
I know we've had our
differences, I know that.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.366
But you know, I...

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:56.007
Honestly, I appreciate everything
that you have done for Jason.

00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:57.485
Oh, God.

00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.766
And I can tell you right now,
you mean the world to him.

00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.330
What? What am I saying?

00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:13.722
I...

00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:24.325
Had sex with your son.

00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:26.722
What?

00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:29.491
You heard me.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.040
How long...

00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.480
How long has this
been going on?

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.890
Is it a relationship?
No! It was one time...

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.162
When did this happen?

00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.850
Can we be done now?

00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.167
No. No, we can't be done.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.566
We're not done until...

00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.045
What...
What's wrong with you?

00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.765
What, is this
what you do?

00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.484
You go around sleeping
with your old students?

00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:57.886
I don't want
to talk about it.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:57:59.047
You're the one
who brought it up.

00:57:59.160 --> 00:58:01.561
No, don't you have
something important to do?

00:58:01.680 --> 00:58:03.360
Don't you have a life
to save or something?

00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:10.400
I'm going to have someone
take you to orthopedics.

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:19.850
Ma'am, your card
was denied.

00:58:19.960 --> 00:58:21.450
Mmm-hmm.

00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.930
Okay, try this one.

00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.530
Okay.

00:58:28.680 --> 00:58:30.364
Can someone call me a cab?

00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:38.605
Jason, okay, calm down.
Jason, I understand. No.

00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:40.085
Turn around. Take me back.
Take me back inside.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.770
What? What?
Take me back.

00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:45.568
Lady! I'm sorry.
Are you okay?

00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:47.603
Let me call you back. Okay?
I'm fine. I'm fine.

00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:50.326
It's okay. I'm fine.
Mike. Mike.

00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:51.930
I'll take her, it's fine.
I'll wait with her.

00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:53.161
No, no, no.
I'm going to wait inside.

00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:54.691
No, no.
I need to talk to you.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.484
Take the chair
inside, please.

00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:02.443
How's your neck?

00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:04.562
Just say what you need to
say and leave me alone.

00:59:05.920 --> 00:59:08.491
Is it true? Did you lie
to Jason about the play?

00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:11.451
Yes. Yes, I did.

00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:14.922
I don't believe it.

00:59:15.040 --> 00:59:17.281
What kind of
teacher are you?

00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:20.569
I mean, you come at me with
this holier than thou bullshit,

00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:22.887
and this is what you do'?
What's wrong with you?

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.650
Fine, fine. I get it.
I'm horrible,

00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.206
I'm a horrible person.
Now would you leave?

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:28.810
No. Not until you tell me what
you're going to do about this.

00:59:28.920 --> 00:59:32.322
You know, I've been fired.
Isn't that enough?

00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.283
What about the play? Oh,
who cares about the play.

00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.846
I do! I care about the play.
I care about my son.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.526
Yeah! Now you care. Fine. Now
that everything's ruined.

00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:41.847
What?

00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:43.325
This is all your fault. I wouldn't
even be here if it wasn't for you.

00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:44.851
I don't know
where you possibly get that.

00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.360
He never would have
written the play

00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:49.171
if you hadn't been such an
abusive, alcoholic jerk.

00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.170
Who took out all your anger on
your son after your wife died.

00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:53.930
Oh, my God.

00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.883
Is that what
this is about?

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:57.843
You believe all that?
Don't try to deny it.

00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.884
No, no, no. I don't drink, for
your information.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.843
I haven't had a drink
since medical school.

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.769
Jason's Mom isn't dead.

01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.291
We're divorced.

01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.001
She lives up in teaneck.
She's remarried.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:13.727
He... he said it was
based on his life.

01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:16.650
Oh, well, jeez, if Jason said
it then it must be true, right?

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.843
God knows there's never been a
writer that just made stuff up.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.411
All right, there are.
Stop it.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:23.602
You think he turns
into a monster as well?

01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.210
Okay. I get it.
Do you?

01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:28.403
Because for an advanced English
teacher you seem awfully naive to me.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.568
Or is your head so full
of, of these stories

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.371
you don't know the difference
between fact and fiction.

01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.925
Is that why
you slept with him?

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.371
Huh?

01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:37.601
Thought he was lord Byron
or something?

01:00:37.720 --> 01:00:38.881
You know what?
You don't know me.

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:40.650
You don't know
anything about me.

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:43.843
Oh, shoe's on the other foot.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.883
Marilyn Avenue.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.287
Hey, you can't
run away from this.

01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:49.481
Yes, I can.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.123
Hi, it's Linda.
Leave a message.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.969
Linda, it's Carl.

01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:05.411
I know I behaved abominably,

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.727
you have every right
to be mad,

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:10.281
but please call me.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:11.970
It's about the play.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.449
Hi, it's Linda.
Leave a message.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:19.122
Linda, call me,
I beg of you.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.969
I swear I'll never
deceive you again.

01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:22.923
I'll be entirely
honest from now on.

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.486
I'll...

01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.924
I'll even tell you
my deepest, darkest secret.

01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:31.405
Something
I've never told anyone.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.928
My audition for sondheim...

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:37.965
I lied.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:41.283
I... I did have
an audition, but...

01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.961
As soon as I walked in
and saw him sitting there,

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:48.971
looking at me with those dark
genius eyes, I couldn't breathe.

01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:50.809
I thought
I was going to die.

01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:53.605
The last thing I remember
before I blacked out

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.890
was the look of utter
confusion on sondheim's face.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.844
And the sound of
the stage manager saying,

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.962
"I think his
name is ka-penis."

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.520
It was the worst
experience of my life.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.845
So there it is.

01:02:12.920 --> 01:02:15.890
I stand naked before you.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.321
Please come back.
Help me out.

01:02:20.560 --> 01:02:24.531
Linda, I'm
having a nervous breakdown!

01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:26.369
I'm having chest pains.

01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:27.440
And a nervous breakdown!

01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:31.009
Call me!

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.340
Uh!

01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:44.530
There has been
an emergency.

01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.687
Carl is in the hospital.

01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:47.404
What? What happened?

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.885
And, well, he keeled
over during rehearsal.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.002
And the kids called 911.
They're beside themselves.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.849
Oh, my God.
Is he okay?

01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.839
Well, it wasn't a heart
attack, thank goodness.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.524
They think stress.
Stress.

01:02:56.640 --> 01:02:58.563
But there's no way
he can finish the play.

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:01.081
And we are days away
from opening night,

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:03.089
there's a ton
of work to do.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.487
And we've sold
$18,000 in tickets.

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:08.922
We need the money.
Someone needs to step in.

01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:13.122
Yeah, you
should call Jason.

01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.969
Oh...
I did.

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.924
And he refuses to help unless
we restore the original ending.

01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:19.849
Which, no,
we cannot do.

01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:23.649
I think you know where
I'm headed with this.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.649
No. No, no, trudie. No, forget it.
I'm not doing it.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.250
I know,
it's not ideal.

01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.725
Ideal? You fired me!

01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.126
Not officially, not yet.

01:03:30.240 --> 01:03:32.280
And if you agree to help,
I'm willing to let you off

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:35.051
with just a little formal
reprimand and that's it...

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.925
Okay, two weeks suspension.
That's if...

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.679
I can't. I can't.
I can't. I can't do it.

01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.603
You started this.

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:43.563
Are you going
to really sit back

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.251
and let everyone else
pay for your mistakes?

01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:49.921
I need you,
the kids need you to...

01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:53.522
To just step up and be a
goddamned teacher here.

01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:56.166
And if you can't do that, you
have no business in a classroom.

01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.042
I want to
think about it.

01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:06.082
Oh, well...

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:08.726
I expect you
there at 3:00.

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:12.847
Okay. This is the last
chance you're gonna get.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:30.126
Hey, Ms. sinclair, I wanna
bend you over your desk!

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.521
"Mother. Oh, my dear mother.
How could you..."

01:04:36.640 --> 01:04:38.961
No, no. Come on. Come on.
It's got to be louder.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:41.651
You got to get them in the cheap seats.
Come on. Loud.

01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.649
"Mother!
Oh, my dear mother!"

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.360
Come on, support it. "How could you
abandon me to such a cruel..."

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.771
Thank God. All right,
listen up, people.

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.202
Uh, Ms. sinclair is going to
take over from here on out.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:57.931
But listen, I'm going to be
sitting here in the front row,

01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:00.520
and I don't want
any funny business, okay?

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.642
Is that clear?

01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:03.841
Yes, Mr. pelaski.

01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.440
Could somebody please
tell me where we are?

01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:15.931
We're doing the new ending.

01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.649
New ending?

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.280
Yeah, Carl wrote it. They were
working on it when he collapsed.

01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:25.288
Carl wrote it?

01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:27.760
Yeah, as long as nobody kills
themselves, it's good with me.

01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:37.211
Fine. Let's just do this.

01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:40.241
Go ahead.

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:41.360
Do you have
any direction?

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.691
Urn...

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:46.400
You're in pain.

01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.644
You're in deep,
unbearable pain.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.329
"Mother!
Oh, my dear mother!"

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.681
"How could you abandon
me to such a cruel fate!"

01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.047
Okay, Halle. "A father
who couldn't love me!"

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:02.322
"A world where I'd never
That's enough."

01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.522
"Oh, God!
I want to die..."

01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:07.251
No, my darling!
You must live! Live!

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.011
Knock it off,
both of you!

01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:12.327
Take it seriously.
Why?

01:06:12.480 --> 01:06:15.211
It sucks.
This ending sucks.

01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:18.244
My grandparents are coming in
from Tucson to see me suck.

01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.761
This isn't Jason's play anymore.
It's bullshit.

01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:22.961
Hey! Language.

01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.251
Where's Jason?

01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.725
We want Jason back.

01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:29.490
Not you, you bitch.

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:32.171
Okay, that's it. One
week detention, miss Anderson!

01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.764
Yes. I'm coming.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.131
Nope.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:04.771
Jason, please
don't make me stand outside.

01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.360
I'm gonna... I'm not going
to leave here until we talk.

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.610
May I come in?

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:15.846
Yeah.

01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:24.961
May I have
a glass of water?

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.323
I'm here to ask for a favor.
Are you kidding me?

01:07:38.480 --> 01:07:40.050
If you could just
write a new ending.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.969
No. No. No.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:44.162
Write a new ending?
Jason, please...

01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:46.482
For what? To make it happy?
To make it cute and safe?

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.568
That's not my story!

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.125
I understand that, but I'm in
an untenable situation here...

01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.004
Hey. While you're at it,

01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:54.288
slap a feel-good ending
on death of a salesman.

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:55.811
Does he really have to die?

01:07:55.920 --> 01:07:57.285
This isn't helping anyone.

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.481
That's because
nothing's gonna help.

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.201
Everything's fucked,
and it's your fault!

01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:03.651
I want to kill myself.

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:05.165
That's not an answer, Jason.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.680
What makes you think
you have the answers'?

01:08:10.880 --> 01:08:13.326
I mean,
who are you, anyway?

01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:14.726
You're just some
lonely old woman

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:16.480
who gets a power trip
lecturing teenagers.

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:22.201
You really think you affect their
lives by reading them emerson?

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.530
You're a joke.

01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.801
They don't respect you.

01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:30.408
The second they finish high
school, they forget you.

01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:38.366
Yes, um...

01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.324
Well...

01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:44.204
Uh...

01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.370
I was thinking about your ending,
and I realized that there

01:08:48.480 --> 01:08:53.088
may be something that I missed in
previous readings of your play.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.850
And that is...

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:57.201
That the ending sucks.

01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:59.049
What?

01:08:59.160 --> 01:09:03.210
Everyone kills themselves?
That's your resolution?

01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.125
Jason, come on.
What do you think?

01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.565
You said,
you loved the ending.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.409
Or is that another lie?

01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:13.841
Well, you know, I do make
mistakes, as you know.

01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.129
Whatever.
I'm done with this.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.561
You know, sometimes
you can't run away.

01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:21.409
And you can't
go to law school.

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.091
And you can't
kill yourself.

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.602
Because sometimes you have
to stay and suck it up.

01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:29.563
"Fuck you!
Ca" you just try?

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.571
I mean, can you imagine that
there might be another ending?

01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:37.202
A different ending,
where everyone doesn't die.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:42.161
No! Get the fuck
out of my house!

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:14.927
This is horrible.
They're gonna hate it.

01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:16.644
It's gonna suck.

01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:18.205
Halle... I can't, I
can't, I can't do this!

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:19.810
No. Halle, calm down.

01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.285
No, no. I can't... I can't
remember any of my lines.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.402
No, no, no.
You know your lines.

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:25.329
Just say them the way we rehearsed
them last week and you'll be terrific.

01:11:25.440 --> 01:11:27.363
I know. I heard you.

01:11:27.480 --> 01:11:29.130
All right?
Thank you.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.685
Yeah.
All right.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.490
All right.
Five minutes.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:34.523
It's five minutes,
everyone.

01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:36.449
All right, you've
worked really hard.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.005
And you know what to do.

01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:39.724
And you're going
to be great.

01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:42.650
And you should all feel
so proud of yourselves.

01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:44.410
I know, I am...

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.480
- Hello, my children of the night.
- Mr. kapinas!

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:47.681
I'm back.

01:11:47.800 --> 01:11:49.404
Mr. kapinas,
you made it.

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.091
Wild horses couldn't keep me away.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:54.362
Ah, dear, dear Linda.

01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:56.926
I am eternally grateful
for all your help,

01:11:57.040 --> 01:11:59.008
and understanding.

01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:01.561
Aw. It was no problem.
How are you?

01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.921
Much better, thank you.
Fully rested,

01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:07.084
mildly medicated and ready
to resume my duties.

01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.282
Well, I think,
everything's under control.

01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:11.129
We've worked
very hard this week.

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:13.561
Oh, don't worry, I've done
this a thousand times.

01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:15.762
Why don't you relax? Take
a seat, enjoy the show.

01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:17.962
Thespians. It's time.

01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.559
Prayer circle of love
and commitment?

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.324
Prayer circle of love
and commitment.

01:12:23.720 --> 01:12:26.200
My future Tony award winners,

01:12:26.320 --> 01:12:27.441
let's all take
a deep breath.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.649
Let it go.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.364
Focus.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:35.130
And as meryl streep
once said,

01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:38.045
when we were doing
Shakespeare in the park,

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.924
"up!"

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.724
- Mmm...
- Mmm...

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:55.689
Here we are.

01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.683
Next year, we are
definitely doing our town.

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:29.040
Why are you not
at the hospital?

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.281
Are you going in?
I'm too nervous.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:56.568
No, not white. Pink.

01:13:56.680 --> 01:13:59.490
They were pink roses. That must
be a good sign, I'm sure of it!

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.206
No, Jane. She's gone.

01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:03.970
She died this morning.

01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:05.889
I don't understand, you said
she was getting better. You...

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.002
She took a turn.

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.367
No. No.

01:14:10.480 --> 01:14:13.051
I'm sorry.
It happened so suddenly.

01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:14.844
She never woke up again.

01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:16.923
Then, she was gone.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:18.246
But I never
got to say goodbye.

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.362
You told me that, I would
see her one last time.

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:21.561
Why didn't you
come get me?

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.523
It would not have
changed anything.

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.728
I could have been there
to tell her that I love her.

01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:27.888
I could have held her hand so she
wouldn't have felt so alone.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:29.889
Jane, control yourself.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:31.764
I must prepare
for the funeral.

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:33.530
It's time to move on.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.845
I never knew my mother.

01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:41.689
But she was beautiful...

01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.645
She loved bright
and colorful things.

01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:48.206
Here. I'll give you
your favorite colors.

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.527
Green for her wings.

01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:53.371
Green with flecks of gold,
just like her eyes.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.160
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Margaret.

01:15:03.440 --> 01:15:05.841
Did you hear me?
I said step away!

01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:09.161
Damn it, Jane!

01:15:12.720 --> 01:15:13.281
That's not me.

01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:36.645
Mother. I'm ready.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:39.127
Yes, daughter.
Come away with me.

01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:41.561
You'll never belong
in this world.

01:15:41.680 --> 01:15:43.205
Leave it all behind.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.244
All the pain and the fear
and the loneliness.

01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:48.362
We'll be together,
always.

01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:51.685
Jane!
Get away.

01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.564
- Please listen to me.
- Get out!

01:15:53.680 --> 01:15:55.648
You ruined everything.
My entire life.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:58.286
I know, I've made mistakes.
I'm sorry.

01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:01.967
I wish I could go back and change
what happened, but I can't.

01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:04.811
Please, Jane,
I'm asking for another chance.

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.890
It's not too late...
I know you want to run away,

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.968
I know you want to punish me,

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:10.920
maybe I deserve it...

01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:16.006
Hmm. It's better
than I thought...

01:16:16.120 --> 01:16:18.327
You do deserve it!
You're the monster. Not me!

01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.011
I know... I know, I am.
I'm so sorry...

01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.610
What the fuck is this?

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:23.960
Jason.

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:32.850
At least in New York they didn't
give a shit about my play,

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:34.371
they didn't try
to destroy it.

01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:36.119
It's not destroyed.
It's still your play.

01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.800
You've ruined the
whole point of the story.

01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:40.884
Jason, I was wrong. I didn't know
what to do, or how to fix it.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.162
And I'm sorry.

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:46.170
I am truly, truly sorry.

01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:50.880
Please don't let my mistakes stand
in the way of your success.

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:43.485
Thank you.

01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.611
Oh, you were wonderful.

01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:54.771
Whoo!

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:20.725
Author! Author!

01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:25.726
He means you.

01:18:29.920 --> 01:18:31.126
Goon.

01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:36.531
There he is.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:35.889
Ms. sinclair.

01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:39.122
Nice work.

01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.002
Thank you.

01:19:41.320 --> 01:19:43.243
May I apologize
for my behavior?

01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:45.727
Oh, no. Forget about it, it
wasn't my finest moment either.

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.763
No, no, no.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.365
I shouldn't have believed that stuff
from the play. I was ridiculous.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:50.606
I'm very sorry.

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:54.208
Apology accepted.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:55.526
Thank you.

01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.483
It's actually true.

01:19:58.840 --> 01:20:00.922
Sort of.

01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:03.202
About the play.

01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.970
I wasn't a great Dad.

01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:08.444
I was absent.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:10.608
Pushed him to do all the
things I wanted him to do.

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:12.085
I'm sure,
you did your best.

01:20:13.160 --> 01:20:16.050
I dated some crazy women.
None of them Irish.

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:18.003
But, uh...

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.248
Creative license, I guess.
Mmm-hmm.

01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.806
Anyway, we learn from
our mistakes, right?

01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:24.524
Yes, we do.

01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:28.169
Good luck with everything.
Thank you.

01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:39.607
And so, Linda sinclair
resumed her life as a schoolteacher.

01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:42.809
Though she brought a new,
modern approach to her craft.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:45.287
Now that you've
all finished the reading,

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:48.609
let's try a little
creative writing exercise.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.645
I'd like you all to write a new
ending to a tale of two cities.

01:20:52.760 --> 01:20:55.081
Now, it could be
anything you like.

01:20:55.200 --> 01:20:58.283
So let your
imaginations run wild.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:00.289
She often saw Dr. Sherwood,

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:04.450
though propriety dictated that she
maintain a respectable distance

01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:08.884
from the father of the young man with
whom she'd so disgraced herself.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.921
That's a good biography.

01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:17.769
I have a copy if you
want to borrow it.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.890
You're a fan?
Of conan Doyle?

01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:23.729
Of course.
Me too.

01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:25.490
Since I was a kid.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:28.610
And that was the end of it.

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.609
How are you?

01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.085
I'm pretty good, thanks.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:37.246
Hey, would you like to grab
a cup of coffee or something?

01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.481
Naturally...

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:39.522
Urn...

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.163
She refused.

01:21:42.200 --> 01:21:43.929
Okay. Why not.

01:21:44.040 --> 01:21:47.726
And so they spoke
in a strictly impersonal way.

01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:49.171
She did some crazy stuff.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:52.648
She had a yard sale one time
when I was out of town,

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:55.286
and sold my entire collection
of ellery queen first editions.

01:21:55.400 --> 01:21:56.208
Oh, no!
Yes!

01:21:58.440 --> 01:22:01.922
That's when I knew the
marriage was kinda over.

01:22:02.040 --> 01:22:04.281
They did not
discuss the boy.

01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:06.004
Jason's doing really well.
Is he?

01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:08.202
Yeah, yeah, he's actually
written another piece.

01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:10.607
Oh.

01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:12.245
And he's work shopping it in a
children's theater in New Jersey.

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.125
I mean, you may or may not realize
some references to orwell,

01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:16.526
and kafka in the first act...

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:18.369
Oh, that's so wonderful.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:20.081
Can I be honest
with you about something?

01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.764
I knew it.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:23.609
Here it comes.

01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:28.886
The whole time we're strolling
along here, I keep thinking...

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:32.561
You know,
you slept with my son.

01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:34.808
And listen...

01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:37.681
I understand that it was just one
of those things or whatever, but...

01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:41.440
I guess, what I am
trying to say is...

01:22:45.040 --> 01:22:46.724
I still think
you're pretty great.

01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:48.524
What?

01:22:48.680 --> 01:22:50.205
Yeah.

01:22:50.320 --> 01:22:53.881
And if it's not too weird...

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:56.048
For you, or me...

01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.802
Walter mosley's speaking over at wilkes
next week, and I thought maybe...

01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:04.288
Linda sinclair.
What are you doing?

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:07.609
You belong here.
At home. Alone.

01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.404
You don't want
to go out there.

01:23:09.520 --> 01:23:12.410
It's a cruel and
unforgiving world.

01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:13.282
Linda.

01:23:13.400 --> 01:23:15.243
Hi, Linda.
Hi.

01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:16.361
Linda.

01:23:16.480 --> 01:23:17.766
You look great.

01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.331
Thank you.

01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:21.408
Are you ready?

01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:22.965
Yes, I am.

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.082
Linda?
Are you listening to me?
