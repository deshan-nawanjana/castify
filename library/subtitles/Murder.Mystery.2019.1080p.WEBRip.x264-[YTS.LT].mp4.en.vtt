WEBVTT

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:14.563
Terrific!

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.688
So I put my finger here,
and check this...

00:00:38.063 --> 00:00:40.438
the watch tells me I have a heart problem.

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:42.438
Wouldn't a mirror tell you the same thing?

00:00:42.521 --> 00:00:44.563
Yeah, but this has weather, too.

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:45.646
Okay.

00:00:45.855 --> 00:00:48.188
We got an hour until
we're meeting the ladies for dinner.

00:00:48.271 --> 00:00:49.539
- Yeah.
- You wanna catch a beer?

00:00:49.563 --> 00:00:51.438
I can't. I gotta run a few errands.

00:00:51.521 --> 00:00:53.938
What? You don't want a beer? What's wrong?

00:00:54.021 --> 00:00:55.021
I...

00:00:55.313 --> 00:00:58.021
got the results back
from the detective exam.

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.105
You failed again?
This is why I never took that test.

00:01:01.188 --> 00:01:03.313
All the anxiety and disappointment.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.105
At some point, you have to realize
you have hit your ceiling

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:07.355
and just give up.

00:01:07.438 --> 00:01:09.478
You know, you should go around
and speak at schools.

00:01:09.521 --> 00:01:12.313
- That was very inspiring.
- I should. Kids need to hear this shit.

00:01:12.396 --> 00:01:13.396
I don't get it, man.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.313
I know all the answers,
I just freeze under pressure.

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:18.855
You know, I can't take the exam
for, like, three more months,

00:01:18.938 --> 00:01:20.563
so I gotta continue lying to Audrey.

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:22.355
So when we're at dinner tonight, please,

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:23.813
- tell your wi...
- Ah! No.

00:01:23.896 --> 00:01:26.271
Come on, man.
You know I'll lie for you anytime.

00:01:26.355 --> 00:01:28.396
I will cover up dead bodies for you.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.605
But if I ask Holly to lie to your wife,
there's no way we're messing around.

00:01:32.688 --> 00:01:33.771
It's Freaky Friday!

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:36.813
You don't have to lie,
just tell her to ignore when I'm lying.

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:37.896
That's it.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.980
- Okay, fine.
- Thank you.

00:01:40.063 --> 00:01:41.438
You owe me.

00:01:41.521 --> 00:01:42.521
See you tonight.

00:01:45.646 --> 00:01:47.771
I gotta get Claritin. Claritin.

00:01:47.855 --> 00:01:49.563
Oh, my God! Look!

00:01:50.271 --> 00:01:51.855
He took her in a helicopter?

00:01:52.146 --> 00:01:54.230
My husband won't even pay for Uber Black.

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:57.855
Yeah. I don't even...
I can't even remember the last time

00:01:57.938 --> 00:02:01.563
that Nick did anything
even remotely romantic.

00:02:01.813 --> 00:02:04.855
I mean, he used to leave me,
like, cute little mixtapes,

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:07.021
little love notes in the bathroom.

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:08.313
Love notes are dead.

00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:09.756
When my husband wants to have sex,

00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:11.733
he just texts me the eggplant
and doughnut emoji.

00:02:12.021 --> 00:02:13.521
Eggplant and doughnut...

00:02:14.438 --> 00:02:15.938
Oh. He's the eggplant.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.188
More like a fingerling potato.

00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.664
It doesn't take that much.

00:02:19.688 --> 00:02:22.063
There are guys at the intersection
selling flowers.

00:02:22.146 --> 00:02:24.605
You just roll down the window,
grab a bunch, bring 'em home.

00:02:24.688 --> 00:02:27.521
- I mean, they couldn't make it any easier.
- No kidding.

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:29.980
I mean, tomorrow
is our 15th wedding anniversary.

00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:33.688
I'm still waiting on that trip to Europe
he promised me on our wedding day.

00:02:33.771 --> 00:02:35.605
- That's been 15 years?
- Yeah.

00:02:35.688 --> 00:02:37.648
I could have walked to Europe by now.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.271
You know, you just have to tell him.

00:02:39.355 --> 00:02:43.146
I just don't want to have to tell him.
I just want him to know.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.938
- No, they never just know.
- I know.

00:02:45.021 --> 00:02:47.164
- That doesn't happen.
- You have to tell men everything.

00:02:47.188 --> 00:02:49.581
If you want the dishes to not go
in the sink, you have to tell them.

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.525
If you want him to shower
before he comes to bed,

00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:52.855
- you have to ask him.
- Ugh.

00:02:52.938 --> 00:02:55.313
That's why they have those signs
in bathrooms at restaurants

00:02:55.396 --> 00:02:57.396
to tell employees to wash their hands.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.646
Those aren't for women, guys.
Those are for men.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.730
Or maybe you could just text him,
airplane, wine glass,

00:03:02.813 --> 00:03:05.730
Italian flag, eggplant,
doughnut, doughnut, doughnut.

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:26.355
Let's go with the 50.

00:03:31.563 --> 00:03:32.646
Claritin...

00:03:40.563 --> 00:03:41.563
Hi, welcome.

00:03:42.146 --> 00:03:43.146
Thank you.

00:03:43.188 --> 00:03:44.831
Thanks a lot.

00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:47.396
Are you gonna tell 'em
about the stuff in your backpack?

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.650
Mind your own business, man.
I'm paying for this.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.063
I like your sneakers.
They must be expensive.

00:03:52.146 --> 00:03:54.313
Is that why can't afford
the Monster Energy Drink

00:03:54.396 --> 00:03:55.896
or the Flamin' Hot Cheetos?

00:03:57.146 --> 00:03:59.396
- Hang on. Hang on.
- Hey, let go of me, man.

00:04:01.438 --> 00:04:02.771
I can't believe I was right.

00:04:03.438 --> 00:04:05.813
Keep your mouth shut.
I'll mess you up, old man.

00:04:05.896 --> 00:04:07.355
Old man. Oh, my God.

00:04:07.438 --> 00:04:08.521
First of all,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.980
I should throw you in jail
just for calling me "old man,"

00:04:12.063 --> 00:04:14.063
but you bring that stuff back,

00:04:14.146 --> 00:04:17.355
I'll let you go 'cause I'm late
for dinner and I'm hungry as shit.

00:04:17.646 --> 00:04:18.646
Go ahead.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.646
- Tylenol PM? Am I right?
- No.

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.581
It's not good for that.
It depends on what time of year you go.

00:04:26.605 --> 00:04:28.405
That makes sense.
Can I get another?

00:04:28.646 --> 00:04:30.105
We're gonna have another one?

00:04:30.188 --> 00:04:33.813
I'm just saying, we're paying today.
Maybe you can take it easy a little bit.

00:04:33.896 --> 00:04:36.396
Hey, hey. Nick. Nick.
What... What's wrong with you?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.146
Sorry. Should I not order
another drink, Detective?

00:04:39.771 --> 00:04:41.105
No. Holly, order another drink.

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:43.480
Order as much as you want.
I was joking around.

00:04:43.563 --> 00:04:44.831
- That's not funny.
- The reason...

00:04:44.855 --> 00:04:47.605
I'm just in a great mood
because I had a great day today.

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:50.539
- Did we have a great day or what?
- It was a fabulous day. Incredible day.

00:04:50.563 --> 00:04:52.730
Really? Did you get another hot case?

00:04:53.105 --> 00:04:53.938
Of what?

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:55.646
"What."

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.146
That was good. No, listen.

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.813
Going great, kid. I promise you.

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:01.271
It's like, uh, they're trusting me
more and more,

00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:03.563
and I, um, I wish I could tell you
what it was,

00:05:03.646 --> 00:05:04.896
but it's... it's confidential.

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:06.771
- Wait a second.
- What?

00:05:06.855 --> 00:05:07.980
Oh, my God.

00:05:08.063 --> 00:05:09.938
- What is this?
- What is that?

00:05:10.021 --> 00:05:12.771
My baby Jimmy got it for me
for my birthday.

00:05:12.855 --> 00:05:13.688
- Jimmy!
- What?

00:05:13.771 --> 00:05:16.480
- Celebration diamonds.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:05:16.563 --> 00:05:18.188
- It's gorgeous!
- Thank you, Audrey.

00:05:18.271 --> 00:05:19.831
- Very expensive.
- Wow, Jimmy.

00:05:20.271 --> 00:05:23.230
I got you something special.
I promise, you're gonna be very happy.

00:05:23.313 --> 00:05:24.605
- Really?
- I can't wait.

00:05:24.688 --> 00:05:28.021
See, I would've pegged you, Nick,
as an Amazon gift card kinda guy,

00:05:28.105 --> 00:05:29.980
but... I'm no detective.

00:05:31.313 --> 00:05:33.105
Hey! You know what, guys?

00:05:33.188 --> 00:05:36.896
Let's toast to my friends,
Nick and Audrey.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.313
Fifteen wonderful years.

00:05:38.396 --> 00:05:39.396
Absolutely.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:41.688
- Fifteen.
- Here's to true love, guys.

00:05:41.771 --> 00:05:42.605
Fifteen.

00:05:42.688 --> 00:05:43.688
- True love.
- Yeah.

00:05:50.355 --> 00:05:53.980
Dinner was insane, but that's expected.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:56.521
But I'll tell you what,

00:05:56.605 --> 00:05:59.230
I want to record Holly
chewing her ice cubes,

00:05:59.313 --> 00:06:01.771
use it as my alarm in the morning.
That's...

00:06:01.855 --> 00:06:04.271
Guarantee me of wanting to
wake up and leave.

00:06:08.938 --> 00:06:11.146
What's the matter?
You didn't like that joke?

00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.688
I'm flossing.

00:06:14.771 --> 00:06:16.063
I can see that.

00:06:17.021 --> 00:06:18.771
You're doing it extra hard tonight.

00:06:19.813 --> 00:06:22.396
And I'm not sleeping with
the fan on tonight. I hate that sound.

00:06:22.813 --> 00:06:25.313
No fan necessary.
We'll crank the AC, babe.

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:31.230
Uh-oh. What, what, what?

00:06:31.313 --> 00:06:33.233
You're gonna yell at me?
I can see this. Hang on.

00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:35.063
Why don't you do some more angry flossing?

00:06:35.896 --> 00:06:38.230
How come we haven't gone to Europe, Nick?

00:06:39.146 --> 00:06:40.480
You have to explain this to me.

00:06:41.271 --> 00:06:42.355
We never go anywhere.

00:06:42.438 --> 00:06:45.271
We travel.
I took you to the Poconos that time.

00:06:45.355 --> 00:06:46.605
What? The Poco... That was...

00:06:46.688 --> 00:06:48.105
That was for a funeral, Nick.

00:06:48.521 --> 00:06:50.980
How about, uh, when we went to Virginia

00:06:51.063 --> 00:06:53.313
when my uncle was in a hospice
and we got to see him die?

00:06:53.396 --> 00:06:54.980
- We did that.
- Ugh, Nick. Come on.

00:06:55.063 --> 00:06:56.521
I'm talking about the postcard.

00:06:56.605 --> 00:06:59.688
- You don't remember that?
- I remember it. Of course I remember it.

00:07:00.188 --> 00:07:03.271
It's been 15 years, Nick.
I don't know what we're waitin' for.

00:07:06.313 --> 00:07:08.896
Now you've gone and done it, Audrey.

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:10.646
What? What'd I do?

00:07:12.355 --> 00:07:14.355
I told you I had something big
for you at dinner,

00:07:14.438 --> 00:07:16.605
and you couldn't wait till
tomorrow morning?

00:07:17.938 --> 00:07:18.938
No.

00:07:20.146 --> 00:07:22.355
We're finally going to Europe.
Happy anniversary.

00:07:22.938 --> 00:07:25.438
Oh, my God. I have chills.

00:07:25.521 --> 00:07:28.355
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:07:28.438 --> 00:07:30.480
Oh, my God! I'm so...

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:33.480
- I ruined your surprise!
- Shh. You didn't ruin anything.

00:07:33.563 --> 00:07:35.605
You're the greatest. You deserve it.
I love you.

00:07:35.688 --> 00:07:38.230
- I love you!
- It's still a surprise. I swear.

00:07:42.396 --> 00:07:45.271
- We can afford it, right? This is all...
- We can afford it, of course.

00:07:45.355 --> 00:07:46.914
- Okay.
- I'm getting my raise this year.

00:07:46.938 --> 00:07:48.605
- Right.
- We're all set. Come on.

00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:50.396
- Hello. Hi.
- Hello.

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:52.271
So, uh, we are on our honeymoon,

00:07:52.355 --> 00:07:54.896
and I was wondering
if we could possibly get an upgrade

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.355
because I have miles. Maybe...

00:07:57.438 --> 00:08:00.730
I don't even know if it's from
this airline, but do they expire, or...

00:08:00.813 --> 00:08:02.980
Sir, you would have needed
to request that in advance.

00:08:03.063 --> 00:08:04.703
- Yeah.
- Right this way, please.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.313
- Thank you. I'm so sorry.
- We did try advance. I tried calling.

00:08:07.396 --> 00:08:09.271
- And, um, nobody...
- Who'd you call?

00:08:09.355 --> 00:08:10.896
- Crazy busy signals.
- Really?

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:12.980
- It's the busy signals!
- Who did you try to call?

00:08:17.188 --> 00:08:19.355
I don't want to give it away.
It was the butler.

00:08:19.438 --> 00:08:20.813
The butler did it.

00:08:21.605 --> 00:08:23.271
It's never the butler who did it.

00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:26.021
I don't even think there are butlers.

00:08:26.105 --> 00:08:29.271
That's just a word created
for those goofy books you're addicted to.

00:08:29.355 --> 00:08:31.313
Would you just please, please shh?

00:08:31.396 --> 00:08:34.438
Leave my books alone, okay?
Just let me read.

00:08:34.521 --> 00:08:36.563
I just like... Makes me happy.

00:08:36.646 --> 00:08:38.521
Are you okay? You're cranky.
Are you bored?

00:08:38.605 --> 00:08:40.396
- I'm gonna go to sleep.
- Take a nap.

00:08:40.938 --> 00:08:42.578
- Are you okay with that?
- Wait, don't...

00:08:42.646 --> 00:08:45.313
But just, please, don't...
don't lay all the way back.

00:08:45.896 --> 00:08:47.313
- Don't take it back?
- No.

00:08:47.396 --> 00:08:49.146
Why? You don't want
my double chin to show?

00:08:49.230 --> 00:08:51.896
It's not your chins, okay. It's just rude.

00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:52.855
Yes.

00:08:52.938 --> 00:08:54.578
- Okay. 'Cause you splay out.
- All right.

00:08:54.646 --> 00:08:57.771
And then your seat is in, like,
the lap of the guy behind you.

00:08:57.855 --> 00:09:00.771
- So just be considerate of everybody.
- I'll stay up. Thank you.

00:09:01.605 --> 00:09:02.646
Timber.

00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:12.813
Oh, excuse me.

00:09:12.896 --> 00:09:14.313
- Hi.
- Hello. Hi.

00:09:14.396 --> 00:09:16.896
Could I please have some earplugs?

00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:17.980
Yes.

00:09:18.021 --> 00:09:19.230
For nine dollars.

00:09:19.688 --> 00:09:22.105
Nine dollars? For earplugs?

00:09:22.188 --> 00:09:23.188
Yes.

00:09:23.396 --> 00:09:25.188
That's okay. I'll just...

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.980
I'll just use my peanuts.

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:29.730
I'll just...

00:09:54.438 --> 00:09:55.438
Wow.

00:10:11.646 --> 00:10:12.730
Oh...

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:15.230
Mm.

00:10:22.313 --> 00:10:24.146
A fellow insomniac, I see.

00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:25.230
Jesus.

00:10:25.313 --> 00:10:26.563
Yes. I...

00:10:27.146 --> 00:10:28.938
Yep. I know, right?

00:10:29.021 --> 00:10:31.146
I just cannot sleep on these things.

00:10:31.396 --> 00:10:33.021
So what brings you across the pond?

00:10:33.105 --> 00:10:36.063
Actually, it's my... it's my honeymoon.

00:10:36.146 --> 00:10:37.646
Oh. Congratulations.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:39.521
- Thank you.
- Where's your husband?

00:10:40.105 --> 00:10:41.105
Dead.

00:10:41.521 --> 00:10:44.063
Asleep. He's dead... dead asleep.

00:10:44.146 --> 00:10:46.188
We've actually been married for 15 years,

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:49.688
but we just have been very, very,
very, very busy.

00:10:49.938 --> 00:10:53.188
Then a toast to the whirlwind
that is your life.

00:10:54.396 --> 00:10:55.438
Yes.

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:56.688
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Oh, yes!

00:10:56.771 --> 00:10:58.730
The bar is for
first class passengers only.

00:10:58.813 --> 00:11:01.230
Of course. Of course it is.
I'm so sorry, yes.

00:11:01.313 --> 00:11:04.480
I will head back to the lower class cabin

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:06.771
and sit where I should and, uh...

00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:08.313
shovel some coal.

00:11:08.355 --> 00:11:09.480
She's my guest.

00:11:09.563 --> 00:11:12.230
Unfortunately, sir,
she'd need her own first class ticket.

00:11:12.313 --> 00:11:13.646
Charles Cavendish.

00:11:14.813 --> 00:11:16.021
I'm so sorry, sir.

00:11:19.938 --> 00:11:20.938
Whoa!

00:11:21.855 --> 00:11:23.313
Charles Cavendish?

00:11:23.855 --> 00:11:24.771
Is that your real name?

00:11:24.855 --> 00:11:26.355
I'm afraid so.

00:11:26.438 --> 00:11:29.021
I mean, that sounds like
it just fell right out of a...

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.271
mystery novel.

00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:32.813
And which character would I be?

00:11:33.896 --> 00:11:36.230
Name like that,
you'd have to be the bad guy.

00:11:37.896 --> 00:11:38.896
Well...

00:11:39.563 --> 00:11:40.771
here's to the bad guys.

00:11:57.188 --> 00:11:59.438
- Okay, so your fiancée...
- Hm.

00:12:00.146 --> 00:12:01.146
...leaves you...

00:12:02.146 --> 00:12:05.480
...for your elderly uncle...

00:12:05.563 --> 00:12:08.105
Will you two kindly shut up?

00:12:08.188 --> 00:12:09.355
Oh, be quiet.

00:12:09.855 --> 00:12:12.938
Or we shall tell everyone about the ferret
you've smuggled in here.

00:12:14.396 --> 00:12:17.271
The whole thing is tawdry, I know.

00:12:17.355 --> 00:12:19.331
- Tawdry.
- He desired my betrothed,

00:12:19.355 --> 00:12:22.021
and Uncle Malcolm always gets
what he wants.

00:12:22.105 --> 00:12:24.063
Malcolm. Uncle Malcolm.

00:12:24.646 --> 00:12:25.688
- Quince.
- Uncle...

00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.813
Malcolm Quince is your uncle?
That billionaire?

00:12:30.146 --> 00:12:32.146
- That's the one.
- Oh, my gosh.

00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:35.313
He looks just like this...

00:12:36.105 --> 00:12:39.646
if this wrinkled olive had $70 billion.

00:12:40.563 --> 00:12:41.896
Seventy billion dollars.

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:44.563
I'm traveling to Monaco with the newlyweds
on his yacht

00:12:44.646 --> 00:12:46.188
for the Grand Prix this weekend.

00:12:46.521 --> 00:12:48.355
Why? Why would you do that?

00:12:48.438 --> 00:12:50.678
Why would you go on their yacht
after what they just did?

00:12:50.730 --> 00:12:52.646
Because I'm English, Mrs. Spitz.

00:12:53.313 --> 00:12:55.521
- I'm a glutton for social masochism.
- Oh.

00:12:55.605 --> 00:13:00.230
And I plan on getting blind drunk
and ruining the festivities.

00:13:01.521 --> 00:13:03.396
Okay. I support that.

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.563
- I say, Audrey...
- Hm.

00:13:06.605 --> 00:13:09.230
Do you and your husband
have plans this weekend?

00:13:14.063 --> 00:13:16.521
You made a joke. That's...

00:13:18.146 --> 00:13:21.188
Holy shit! This plane has a bar?

00:13:21.271 --> 00:13:23.313
Sir, this is the first class lounge.

00:13:23.396 --> 00:13:25.355
I'm gonna have to ask you
to return to your seat.

00:13:25.438 --> 00:13:26.771
There's bars on planes now?

00:13:26.855 --> 00:13:28.771
Planes have bars now. In first class.

00:13:28.855 --> 00:13:31.855
This is... Man, I wish my mother was
still alive to see this.

00:13:31.938 --> 00:13:33.521
She was an alcoholic, but a nice one.

00:13:33.605 --> 00:13:36.122
Sir, if you don't return to your seat,
I'm gonna have to call...

00:13:36.146 --> 00:13:37.146
The cops.

00:13:37.605 --> 00:13:38.605
So that's my wife

00:13:38.646 --> 00:13:42.188
talking to that handsome guy over there
with the one chin.

00:13:42.521 --> 00:13:46.396
So I'm gonna go break that shit up,
possibly grab myself a beer,

00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.771
maybe you a Xanax.

00:13:49.855 --> 00:13:52.146
...the wine on board is worth a letter.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.146
People don't write letters
anymore, do they?

00:13:55.688 --> 00:13:58.771
- Such a pity.
- It's just, it's all so tactical.

00:13:59.313 --> 00:14:00.688
Yeah, that's true.

00:14:02.146 --> 00:14:03.021
Hey!

00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:03.938
Nick.

00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:06.730
- How are you?
- Hi, honey. You're awake.

00:14:07.188 --> 00:14:08.581
- Was your nappie good?
- Been awake.

00:14:08.605 --> 00:14:10.205
- I was looking for you.
- I know, I'm...

00:14:10.271 --> 00:14:12.646
- Well, I met this lovely gentleman.
- Oh, yeah?

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:15.105
I'd like you to meet Charles Cavendish.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:16.771
- He's a lord. Right?
- How do you do?

00:14:16.855 --> 00:14:18.938
- A lord?
- Well, actually a viscount.

00:14:19.021 --> 00:14:21.438
- Oh.
- Although viscounts are addressed as Lord,

00:14:21.521 --> 00:14:24.063
which probably accounts
for the lovely Audrey's confusion.

00:14:24.146 --> 00:14:26.271
There you go.
She gets confused with me too.

00:14:26.355 --> 00:14:28.896
Sometimes I'm the king.
Sometimes I'm Daddy.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.896
So... can I get a Labatts, brother?

00:14:32.855 --> 00:14:34.146
That'll be 17 euro.

00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:35.480
No, no, no. Please.

00:14:35.563 --> 00:14:36.730
The beer is on me.

00:14:36.813 --> 00:14:39.521
I'm not just taking a beer
from somebody I don't know.

00:14:39.605 --> 00:14:40.605
Oh, my gosh.

00:14:40.688 --> 00:14:44.688
And I do hope you take advantage
of my other offer.

00:14:44.771 --> 00:14:46.771
Hey. I'm not just gonna stand here

00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:49.480
while you offer to pay me
to have sex with my wife.

00:14:49.563 --> 00:14:51.563
But out of curiosity,
how much are we talking?

00:14:51.646 --> 00:14:52.813
- Great.
- I wouldn't do it.

00:14:52.896 --> 00:14:54.521
- Hey, listen to me.
- What?

00:14:54.605 --> 00:14:58.480
He is inviting us to spend the weekend
with him on a yacht with his family.

00:14:58.563 --> 00:14:59.980
Well, we have plans.

00:15:00.438 --> 00:15:01.980
On a bus.

00:15:02.063 --> 00:15:05.646
A bus that is bound
for the idyllic village of San Grigio,

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.980
where we can watch a demonstration
on how they age ham.

00:15:10.063 --> 00:15:12.313
- Let me explain something.
- Tell me what I'm missing.

00:15:12.396 --> 00:15:13.436
- Are you kidding me?
- Go.

00:15:13.896 --> 00:15:16.771
We would be sailing
around European harbors.

00:15:16.855 --> 00:15:19.021
- Yeah.
- Okay? We'd be eating fresh fish.

00:15:19.105 --> 00:15:20.855
- Right.
- And we'd be drinking wine.

00:15:20.938 --> 00:15:22.313
- Hmm.
- We'd be together.

00:15:22.396 --> 00:15:23.271
That's nice.

00:15:23.355 --> 00:15:25.188
- They have a chef.
- They have a chef.

00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:26.980
His name is Maurice. Maurice?

00:15:27.063 --> 00:15:28.646
- Maurice, yes.
- Maurice.

00:15:29.063 --> 00:15:30.896
"Some people call me Maurice."

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:33.730
Remember that one?

00:15:34.480 --> 00:15:36.080
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

00:15:37.021 --> 00:15:38.230
I gotcha.

00:15:38.313 --> 00:15:39.313
So listen...

00:15:39.355 --> 00:15:40.480
What are you doing?

00:15:40.563 --> 00:15:44.188
Why would two adults come into a bathroom
on an airplane?

00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:46.771
Honey, come on.
To have a private conversation.

00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:47.938
Ah, that's funny.

00:15:48.021 --> 00:15:49.980
Listen. I'm just trying to understand

00:15:50.063 --> 00:15:53.813
why you are turning down
the opportunity of a lifetime.

00:15:53.896 --> 00:15:55.521
Because I don't trust that guy.

00:15:55.605 --> 00:15:58.021
- Why?
- 'Cause instincts.

00:15:58.105 --> 00:15:58.938
Your instincts?

00:15:59.021 --> 00:16:01.501
The same ones that told you
you were about to get laid in here?

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:02.855
I'm not getting laid?

00:16:02.938 --> 00:16:06.771
Come on! When is the next time you and I
are gonna be able to get on a yacht?

00:16:06.855 --> 00:16:09.730
I'm just saying, all those times
we're eating ham sandwiches

00:16:09.813 --> 00:16:12.605
and you're always asking,
"How do they age the ham?"

00:16:12.688 --> 00:16:14.914
- Never had that...
- We'll never ask that question again

00:16:14.938 --> 00:16:17.081
- because we'll be in San Grigio.
- That never happened.

00:16:17.105 --> 00:16:20.271
They'll give us the reason
on how they do it so perfectly.

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.230
Okay. You wanna know the truth?

00:16:22.313 --> 00:16:23.688
- You're breaking my heart.
- Why?

00:16:23.771 --> 00:16:25.146
I feel like a schmuck

00:16:25.230 --> 00:16:28.771
because I've been working my ass off
and saving money, and now you know why.

00:16:28.855 --> 00:16:31.438
It was to take us on this trip.
And I know I'm not a duke.

00:16:31.521 --> 00:16:33.355
I understand. He's a viscount, but...

00:16:33.438 --> 00:16:35.771
- I don't even know what that is.
- I know. It's okay.

00:16:36.438 --> 00:16:37.438
I'm sorry.

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:38.355
I love you.

00:16:38.438 --> 00:16:40.855
- I got lost. I got swept up in it.
- I know.

00:16:40.938 --> 00:16:43.258
But it's okay. We're gonna do the bus.
It's gonna be great.

00:16:43.313 --> 00:16:45.033
We'll do the bus.
You're gonna love the bus!

00:16:49.688 --> 00:16:53.605
Hey! Hey, Gonzales.
Where is our welcome glass of champagne?

00:16:53.688 --> 00:16:55.488
- We were promised...
- Summer hit me!

00:16:55.563 --> 00:16:57.523
...a glass of champagne when we arrived...

00:16:57.563 --> 00:17:00.730
Zip it! Both of you! Will you stop that?

00:17:00.813 --> 00:17:02.313
I know you hear me!

00:17:03.646 --> 00:17:04.480
Shut up!

00:17:04.563 --> 00:17:06.203
Let's do the... We'll do the yacht, okay?

00:17:06.271 --> 00:17:07.313
- Thank you.
- All right.

00:17:07.396 --> 00:17:08.730
Cavendish!

00:17:08.813 --> 00:17:11.146
We've changed our minds. We're gonna come.

00:17:11.605 --> 00:17:12.605
Splendid.

00:17:33.188 --> 00:17:34.414
- Hello.
<i>- Bienvenidos.</i>

00:17:34.438 --> 00:17:35.813
Thank you.

00:17:35.896 --> 00:17:37.480
- Thank you.
<i>- De nada.</i>

00:17:37.563 --> 00:17:39.271
- This is amazing.
<i>- Señor.</i>

00:17:39.355 --> 00:17:40.771
I thought it was gonna be bigger.

00:17:40.855 --> 00:17:41.730
- What?
- I did.

00:17:41.813 --> 00:17:43.855
- Bigger than this?
- I really did.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:46.480
I bet that's Cavendish's ex-fiancée

00:17:46.563 --> 00:17:48.313
who left him for his uncle.

00:17:48.396 --> 00:17:52.021
Oh, okay.
I'm starving. Where's that Maurice dude?

00:17:52.105 --> 00:17:54.646
Uh, I don't think
we're supposed to talk to him directly.

00:17:54.730 --> 00:17:56.646
- Let's wait for dinner.
- Which is when?

00:17:56.730 --> 00:17:59.688
I don't... Honey, it's later.
I don't know. It's Europe, okay?

00:17:59.771 --> 00:18:03.021
The bus observes
a standard American dinnertime, so...

00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.688
Oh, baby, this is like a painting.

00:18:05.771 --> 00:18:08.251
- No, it's nice...
- It just doesn't look real.

00:18:08.313 --> 00:18:10.313
- It's...
- Oh, my God!

00:18:10.396 --> 00:18:12.396
Wow. Look. She's so pretty.

00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:14.400
- Very pretty.
- She's that kind of pretty

00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:16.688
that you don't really know
what country she's from.

00:18:16.771 --> 00:18:18.855
I mean, I can't tell. Can you tell?

00:18:18.938 --> 00:18:19.855
Japan.

00:18:19.938 --> 00:18:22.813
Ah, yes, yes. You see? See?
She can hear you.

00:18:22.896 --> 00:18:24.938
She's not a... not on television right now.

00:18:25.021 --> 00:18:27.355
- You're watching a real person.
- Shh.

00:18:27.730 --> 00:18:29.730
Crashing the party with civilians.

00:18:29.813 --> 00:18:30.855
Are you drunk?

00:18:30.938 --> 00:18:32.730
It's only noon, Suzi, darling.

00:18:33.563 --> 00:18:34.605
Of course I'm drunk.

00:18:34.688 --> 00:18:35.938
So, where is your beloved,

00:18:36.021 --> 00:18:37.646
Sir Liver Spots?

00:18:37.730 --> 00:18:38.938
Malcolm is not here yet.

00:18:39.021 --> 00:18:40.813
You know how he likes to make an entrance.

00:18:41.188 --> 00:18:44.438
You'd know more about Malcolm's entrances
than anyone at this point.

00:18:48.063 --> 00:18:50.703
- Great to meet you. You're terrific.
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

00:18:50.730 --> 00:18:53.271
I'm sorry you had to see that.

00:18:53.355 --> 00:18:55.414
- Actually, I started to like you.
- She deserved that.

00:18:55.438 --> 00:18:58.188
- Very good. You came on strong.
- She is not nice. You're hurt.

00:18:58.271 --> 00:18:59.105
Charles.

00:18:59.188 --> 00:19:01.021
So glad you could make it.

00:19:01.605 --> 00:19:03.563
And you brought guests.

00:19:03.646 --> 00:19:05.938
Allow me to introduce my cousin, Tobey.

00:19:06.021 --> 00:19:08.980
Malcolm's only son
and the man Suzi would have left me for,

00:19:09.063 --> 00:19:10.423
had he not been a screaming queen.

00:19:10.855 --> 00:19:13.355
- Okay.
- Thank you for having us aboard, sir.

00:19:13.438 --> 00:19:14.646
Yeah. Hey, really nice.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.063
It's my father's boat.

00:19:16.146 --> 00:19:19.730
Oh, well, her father, uh, let me use
his lawnmower one time,

00:19:19.813 --> 00:19:21.855
- so I know how that goes.
- Yeah.

00:19:23.271 --> 00:19:24.438
How do you know Charles?

00:19:24.521 --> 00:19:27.021
Oh. We go back to six hours ago?

00:19:27.105 --> 00:19:28.646
- Yes.
- We met on an airplane.

00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.355
He was very nice to include us.

00:19:30.438 --> 00:19:32.313
We have a spare cabin for them, I assume.

00:19:33.105 --> 00:19:36.771
Well, seeing as you have so much history,
I'm sure we can find some room.

00:19:36.855 --> 00:19:39.414
Thank you. Thanks for the warm welcome.
Appreciate it. After you.

00:19:39.438 --> 00:19:42.247
- Up here? This keeps going up?
- Really nice of you. So we go this way?

00:19:42.271 --> 00:19:44.688
- Wow.
- There's another deck, hun. Another deck!

00:19:45.105 --> 00:19:47.813
"Sex-crazed oldster Malcolm Quince

00:19:47.896 --> 00:19:52.188
wed 23-year-old ski instructor
Suzi Nakamura this week."

00:19:52.271 --> 00:19:54.688
- Mm-hmm.
- "Why would the Tokyo-born tart

00:19:54.771 --> 00:19:56.938
trade downhills for dentures?

00:19:57.021 --> 00:20:01.396
Perhaps the $70 billion
his son, Tobey, was set to inherit."

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.063
- Wow.
- Oh, my God, baby.

00:20:03.563 --> 00:20:06.438
We are literally right in the middle
of a TMZ story.

00:20:06.521 --> 00:20:10.646
You were right about this yacht.
Their shaving cream smells like coconuts.

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.813
- It's incredible.
- Sorry.

00:20:12.896 --> 00:20:14.605
You're allergic to rich people now?

00:20:14.688 --> 00:20:18.480
No. Stop it! I'm allergic to stuff.
Would you please grab me the Claritin?

00:20:18.563 --> 00:20:19.896
Yes. Here.

00:20:21.271 --> 00:20:24.480
Baby, that's Allegra.
You said you packed Claritin.

00:20:24.563 --> 00:20:25.563
That's the same thing.

00:20:25.605 --> 00:20:27.730
No, honey. Allegra doesn't work for me.

00:20:28.188 --> 00:20:29.188
Oh.

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:33.188
Okay. When we get to Monaco,
I'll get you your Claritin.

00:20:33.271 --> 00:20:35.730
It's not... It's gonna be called
something else over there,

00:20:35.813 --> 00:20:38.521
I'm telling you.
Just remember, we... The blue box.

00:20:38.605 --> 00:20:42.938
You know, "Allegra" in, uh, French
means the same shit as Claritin.

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.105
- Smile.
- Yes.

00:20:46.188 --> 00:20:48.730
You need to stop drinking. You're a drunk.

00:20:48.813 --> 00:20:49.855
Look at him.

00:20:49.938 --> 00:20:53.313
Why is he torturing himself like that?
I mean, she's already married to Malcolm.

00:20:53.688 --> 00:20:55.938
I don't know what else
he's expecting her to say to him.

00:20:56.021 --> 00:20:57.855
She's saying he's a cad...

00:20:58.271 --> 00:21:00.146
...and he's saying she's a tramp,

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:01.396
and they're both right.

00:21:01.688 --> 00:21:03.563
How do I know you? You're...

00:21:03.646 --> 00:21:04.813
You're an actress, right?

00:21:04.896 --> 00:21:06.855
All women are actresses, dear.

00:21:07.271 --> 00:21:09.396
I'm just clever enough to get paid for it.

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.980
Grace Ballard.

00:21:11.438 --> 00:21:12.813
Oh!

00:21:12.896 --> 00:21:14.063
My God!

00:21:14.563 --> 00:21:17.980
That's... This is incr...
I'm a massive fan of yours!

00:21:18.063 --> 00:21:20.063
- Like, number one!
- Oh.

00:21:20.146 --> 00:21:21.896
- This isn't...
- I know. It's incredible.

00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:25.480
I am Nick Spitz. This is my wife, Allison.

00:21:25.563 --> 00:21:27.688
- I can't believe...
- Aud... Audrey. I'm Audrey.

00:21:27.771 --> 00:21:29.271
- I said Audrey!
- No, you didn't.

00:21:29.355 --> 00:21:31.855
Allison is the character
she played in the...

00:21:31.938 --> 00:21:34.230
Remember the one?
We watched it together.

00:21:34.313 --> 00:21:36.497
Where it's a beautiful lady,
it turns out she's a robot?

00:21:36.521 --> 00:21:38.081
- And there's the bra...
- She's the robot!

00:21:38.105 --> 00:21:40.230
- There's guns coming out of your bra.
- Yes!

00:21:40.313 --> 00:21:42.313
<i>Sex Machina.</i> My breakout role.

00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:45.521
So good.
Look at this, right in front of us!

00:21:45.605 --> 00:21:47.688
I feel like I got kicked
in the belly right now!

00:21:47.771 --> 00:21:49.605
- Okay. Hey, hey, hey.
- I lost my wind!

00:21:49.896 --> 00:21:51.896
Let's go put on some sunscreen
'cause it's...

00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.700
You already put the sunscreen
on me earlier.

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:56.063
No, we're gonna... we're gonna
reapply the sunscreen.

00:21:56.146 --> 00:21:57.914
- We're putting more on?
- We're gonna reapply.

00:21:57.938 --> 00:21:59.146
All right. We'll put more on.

00:21:59.230 --> 00:22:01.372
- So nice to meet you.
- I can't believe... This is great!

00:22:01.396 --> 00:22:03.116
- He's so excited.
- We're on the same ship!

00:22:05.605 --> 00:22:08.480
Look at that. It says that her last name
isn't even really Ballard.

00:22:08.563 --> 00:22:09.605
Well, so what?

00:22:10.188 --> 00:22:12.068
How do you just come out
looking that beautiful?

00:22:12.521 --> 00:22:14.730
- Oh, she's had it all done.
- What?

00:22:15.063 --> 00:22:17.355
Lips, nose, chin.

00:22:17.438 --> 00:22:18.438
No!

00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:20.480
People really get their chins done?

00:22:20.563 --> 00:22:21.938
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh!

00:22:22.021 --> 00:22:24.313
That was so directed at me,
it was disgusting.

00:22:24.396 --> 00:22:26.456
You want me to get my chin done.
And I'm not...

00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:29.230
I love you for who you are.
Although it's an option.

00:22:29.313 --> 00:22:31.456
Would you guys excuse me for a moment?

00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:34.063
- I should say hello to the Maharajah.
- Absolutely.

00:22:34.146 --> 00:22:36.247
- Everyone's saying it.
- Do you believe we're on a boat

00:22:36.271 --> 00:22:39.230
where the guy said, "I'm gonna go have
a conversation with the Maharajah?"

00:22:39.313 --> 00:22:41.021
- That was big.
- Is this real?

00:22:41.105 --> 00:22:41.938
Excuse me, ma'am?

00:22:42.021 --> 00:22:44.605
Is there a Maurice here?
'Cause I'm hungry as hell.

00:22:44.688 --> 00:22:45.813
Yes, sir. He's preparing.

00:22:45.896 --> 00:22:47.696
He's preparing. Okay.
Is he ever gonna finish?

00:22:48.021 --> 00:22:49.938
Please tell Maurice
to step on the gas.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:53.230
- Oh, honey, honey, honey.
- Mm-hmm?

00:22:53.313 --> 00:22:56.980
Okay, um, don't look right now,
but there's a really scary man

00:22:57.063 --> 00:22:58.438
- with an eye patch...
- Mm-hmm?

00:22:58.521 --> 00:23:00.438
...who's just staring right at us.

00:23:00.521 --> 00:23:02.480
I said don't look and you can't not do it.

00:23:02.563 --> 00:23:04.283
You say eye patch and scary,
I'm gonna look.

00:23:04.313 --> 00:23:06.073
I'm sorry.
It's physically impossible not to.

00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:07.938
All right. Okay.
He's walking at us.

00:23:08.021 --> 00:23:09.563
- Honey, honey.
- Play it cool.

00:23:09.646 --> 00:23:11.789
- Hey, fellas. What's up? How are ya?
- Hey. Hi.

00:23:11.813 --> 00:23:13.855
- Who let you two on board?
- Excuse me?

00:23:13.938 --> 00:23:15.230
What is happening right now?

00:23:15.313 --> 00:23:17.313
They're my guests, Colonel.

00:23:17.396 --> 00:23:19.771
- This weekend is for family only.
- Really?

00:23:19.855 --> 00:23:21.938
The last time I checked,
you're not family.

00:23:22.313 --> 00:23:24.521
Neither is Soviet Chewbacca over there.

00:23:25.188 --> 00:23:26.188
Nick, Audrey.

00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:27.910
- Yeah, you're not family for sure.
- Okay.

00:23:27.938 --> 00:23:30.646
Jesus. So I see one of them
was packing heat.

00:23:30.730 --> 00:23:33.563
- Was I supposed to bring a gun?
- Oh, I doubt it's even loaded.

00:23:33.646 --> 00:23:37.063
That's Colonel Charles Ulenga
of the Namibian Defense Force.

00:23:37.146 --> 00:23:38.188
Malcolm's best friend.

00:23:38.271 --> 00:23:40.646
He saved his life
from a bombing attempt in '94.

00:23:41.105 --> 00:23:42.730
That's where he lost his eye and his...

00:23:42.813 --> 00:23:44.480
And his dick? Did he lose his dick?

00:23:44.563 --> 00:23:47.355
- Honey, why?
- I thought that maybe it was his dick.

00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:51.688
And that's Sergei Radjenko,
former Spetsnaz, and his bodyguard.

00:23:52.355 --> 00:23:54.146
Crazy eye patch guy needs a bodyguard?

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.938
Whoa! The hand!

00:23:57.021 --> 00:23:59.688
There's a hand.
It's not on his body anymore.

00:24:00.563 --> 00:24:02.563
Oh, look at this.
Now he's smoking his dick!

00:24:02.605 --> 00:24:05.230
- He's smoking his dick!
- No. Oh, God. Would you stop it?

00:24:05.313 --> 00:24:07.605
I'm just having fun. It's a boat.

00:24:08.563 --> 00:24:09.923
Can I ask you a question?

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:12.980
What exactly... is a maharajah?

00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:14.355
Why don't you ask him yourself?

00:24:14.438 --> 00:24:15.271
No.

00:24:15.355 --> 00:24:18.063
Vik, I have some guests
I'd like you to meet.

00:24:18.146 --> 00:24:19.771
Nick and Audrey Spitz,

00:24:20.396 --> 00:24:25.021
I present the exalted Maharajah
Vikram Shivan Govindan of Mumbai.

00:24:25.105 --> 00:24:27.271
- Oh, my gosh. It's so...
- Hey.

00:24:28.938 --> 00:24:30.313
So nice to...

00:24:32.813 --> 00:24:34.213
- Nice...
- We're...

00:24:37.105 --> 00:24:40.771
Yo-ho-ho! That was very hilarious. Ah!

00:24:40.855 --> 00:24:42.563
With all the bowin' and shit.

00:24:42.646 --> 00:24:45.438
You know, when a brown person bows,
white people bow back, innit?

00:24:45.521 --> 00:24:47.396
- Up high. How about...
- I'm sorry.

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:49.105
He's giving you... Respect!

00:24:49.188 --> 00:24:51.646
- That was very good. Very funny.
- That was a joke.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.646
Audrey has a question
she'd like to ask you.

00:24:53.938 --> 00:24:55.355
Let me hear it.

00:24:55.438 --> 00:24:59.938
Oh. We were actually wondering,
what exactly is a maharajah?

00:25:00.021 --> 00:25:02.230
How do you...
Do you have to go to a school for that?

00:25:02.313 --> 00:25:03.896
Yeah, I was born into the game.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:06.063
- Oh, you're born into it.
- Okay, born into it.

00:25:07.146 --> 00:25:08.230
What do you do, Nick?

00:25:08.313 --> 00:25:10.438
- I am...
- Nick's a detective.

00:25:10.521 --> 00:25:12.813
Tight! You ever wet up anyone?

00:25:12.896 --> 00:25:15.105
- What's that?
- Yeah, you know, like drill,

00:25:15.188 --> 00:25:17.896
bust a cap, waste. You're like...

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:20.021
- He's funny. No, never shot anybody.
- No! God!

00:25:20.105 --> 00:25:20.980
Which is a good thing.

00:25:21.063 --> 00:25:24.063
Nick is... Well, it's just that
you're a terrible shot.

00:25:24.146 --> 00:25:25.313
He's a terrible shot.

00:25:25.396 --> 00:25:27.188
He barely got out of the academy

00:25:27.271 --> 00:25:31.146
because he couldn't even meet, like,
his minimum marksmanship skills.

00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:34.146
Audrey is lactose intolerant.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:35.855
- She also burps in her sleep.
- What?

00:25:35.938 --> 00:25:38.855
I just thought 'cause we are discussing
each other's flaws right now,

00:25:38.938 --> 00:25:40.313
you wanted to put it on the table.

00:25:40.396 --> 00:25:43.563
I'm sorry I... Listen, I didn't think
that was a sensitive subject...

00:25:43.646 --> 00:25:46.480
It's not a sensitive subject,
I just don't like you telling

00:25:46.563 --> 00:25:48.980
- everybody we meet.
- I'm sorry I brought it up. Never mind.

00:26:18.313 --> 00:26:20.605
- Whoa.
- Oh, my gosh. Look at this.

00:26:20.688 --> 00:26:22.730
- Look at this crazy.
- Wow. Babe.

00:26:22.813 --> 00:26:25.313
Well, this room is as nice
as the way you look.

00:26:25.396 --> 00:26:28.813
- You look stunning.
- Thank you, honey. That's so sweet.

00:26:30.938 --> 00:26:31.980
What?

00:26:32.063 --> 00:26:33.438
Everybody's in tuxedos.

00:26:33.521 --> 00:26:35.997
- I wish you'd let me pack.
- I shoulda wore socks. You're right.

00:26:36.021 --> 00:26:38.980
- Yo! Juan Carlos!
- Hey!

00:26:39.063 --> 00:26:41.396
- Oh, good luck, man.
- Hey.

00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:44.730
Hi. Hi, there.
What are we wishing you good luck for?

00:26:44.813 --> 00:26:48.271
Well, he is racing
in the Monaco Grand Prix tomorrow.

00:26:48.355 --> 00:26:50.146
Wow. That's big.

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.355
Juan Carlos Rivera,
let me introduce you to...

00:26:55.521 --> 00:26:57.896
Steve and Lady Steve.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.539
- What?
- No.

00:26:59.563 --> 00:27:01.480
- No, no.
- I mean, if you want.

00:27:01.563 --> 00:27:03.855
- Just met us once.
- Yeah, all right. I'm gonna...

00:27:03.938 --> 00:27:04.997
- I'm Audrey.
- ...go again.

00:27:05.021 --> 00:27:06.688
I'm Nick, and then we're the Spitzes.

00:27:06.771 --> 00:27:08.230
Juan Carlos, huh?

00:27:08.313 --> 00:27:09.396
Hey, Juan Carlos.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.771
So you're a race car driver.

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:13.146
Good, yes.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:15.605
Wow. How do you
get into something like that?

00:27:15.938 --> 00:27:17.938
Uh, number one, yes.

00:27:18.396 --> 00:27:19.813
You don't speak English, do you?

00:27:20.896 --> 00:27:23.021
Uh, very fast. Very fast.

00:27:23.105 --> 00:27:24.480
- Huh? Welcome.
- Okay.

00:27:38.646 --> 00:27:39.688
What's that?

00:27:40.438 --> 00:27:42.813
That is the Quince dagger.

00:27:43.938 --> 00:27:46.813
Chinese steel,
jewels from across the Orient.

00:27:47.355 --> 00:27:49.771
A gift to the family from Marco Polo,

00:27:50.105 --> 00:27:51.313
or so the legend says.

00:27:51.396 --> 00:27:52.396
God.

00:27:52.646 --> 00:27:55.146
Nick's grandmother gave us
a toaster from Sears.

00:27:55.230 --> 00:27:57.230
So the legend says.

00:28:08.688 --> 00:28:10.313
Oh, look.

00:28:10.396 --> 00:28:12.396
Here comes Daddy.

00:28:14.188 --> 00:28:15.188
What's that?

00:28:26.688 --> 00:28:27.938
Captain Wong,

00:28:28.396 --> 00:28:30.896
I'd like to address my guests privately.

00:28:31.146 --> 00:28:32.146
Certainly.

00:28:41.355 --> 00:28:42.355
My friends,

00:28:43.063 --> 00:28:45.730
welcome to the <i>Mediterranean Queen.</i>

00:28:45.813 --> 00:28:48.480
I can't tell you
how much it warms my heart

00:28:49.105 --> 00:28:51.313
that you have made this trip here

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.271
to celebrate my nuptials.

00:28:53.355 --> 00:28:55.521
You will find, as you get older,

00:28:56.021 --> 00:28:58.146
that you begin to take stock of life.

00:28:59.688 --> 00:29:01.605
Not just where you've succeeded,

00:29:02.563 --> 00:29:03.855
but where you've failed.

00:29:05.605 --> 00:29:06.605
Who...

00:29:07.188 --> 00:29:08.188
you've failed.

00:29:15.563 --> 00:29:16.563
Suzi,

00:29:17.438 --> 00:29:18.730
my darling bride,

00:29:19.271 --> 00:29:22.313
who has so much of her life ahead of her.

00:29:24.146 --> 00:29:28.105
Grace, who shines so brightly
on the silver screen.

00:29:34.105 --> 00:29:36.355
Juan Carlos, my godson,

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:40.313
who strives to lead my race team
to victory.

00:29:43.188 --> 00:29:44.188
You...

00:29:46.646 --> 00:29:47.646
Who are you?

00:29:49.063 --> 00:29:51.646
- Oh. Hey. We're the Spitzes.
- We're the...

00:29:52.021 --> 00:29:53.021
The who?

00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:55.813
Uh, I'm Audrey, and Nick Spitz.

00:29:56.188 --> 00:29:57.521
- Great.
- We love the boat.

00:29:57.605 --> 00:29:59.730
- A boat? I mean, this is a ship.
- It's beyond.

00:29:59.813 --> 00:30:02.164
- Never seen anything like this.
- Eric Lamonsoff has a boat.

00:30:02.188 --> 00:30:03.788
We go fishing. He's got a Boston Whaler.

00:30:03.813 --> 00:30:04.855
This is gigantic.

00:30:04.938 --> 00:30:06.646
They're my guests, Uncle.

00:30:06.938 --> 00:30:08.605
You brought guests?

00:30:08.688 --> 00:30:11.230
Well, you did take my plus-one.

00:30:11.938 --> 00:30:13.938
I'm so sorry. Would you like us to leave?

00:30:14.021 --> 00:30:16.456
We could... I don't know
how we're getting out of here, though.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.271
We're... We're out to sea.
Is there an Uber for boats?

00:30:19.355 --> 00:30:21.563
- Out... Out of the room, Nick.
- Out of the room?

00:30:21.646 --> 00:30:23.246
We can go out of the room, absolutely...

00:30:23.271 --> 00:30:24.271
No.

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:26.355
That won't be necessary.

00:30:26.688 --> 00:30:28.771
- Okay. So we'll stick around.
- So we stay. Okay.

00:30:29.563 --> 00:30:31.146
My nephew, Charles,

00:30:31.896 --> 00:30:34.313
who always finds a way
to keep me on my toes.

00:30:36.230 --> 00:30:40.146
My friend, the Colonel,
who's kept me safe these many years.

00:30:41.105 --> 00:30:46.313
Vikram, whose family fortunes have
always been intertwined with my own.

00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:52.313
And my Tobias.

00:30:53.271 --> 00:30:55.355
All I ever wanted was a son,

00:30:56.271 --> 00:30:57.563
and here you are.

00:30:58.355 --> 00:30:59.855
My boy.

00:31:03.813 --> 00:31:07.438
I've spoken to all of you
about your position in my will.

00:31:08.105 --> 00:31:12.355
I have thought long and hard
about what each of you is truly worth,

00:31:13.396 --> 00:31:15.521
and I've come to this conclusion.

00:31:16.730 --> 00:31:19.146
You are all leeches.

00:31:19.938 --> 00:31:21.021
Repugnant.

00:31:21.563 --> 00:31:22.605
Blood fat.

00:31:23.063 --> 00:31:27.605
Suckling on the tit of my good work
for so many years.

00:31:29.563 --> 00:31:30.896
You repulse me.

00:31:34.813 --> 00:31:36.896
Can't get this on a bus, baby.

00:31:36.980 --> 00:31:38.438
- This is incredible.
- I know it.

00:31:38.521 --> 00:31:39.681
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:42.480
Which is why I have drafted a new will.

00:31:43.730 --> 00:31:46.355
It states that my entire fortune

00:31:47.021 --> 00:31:48.396
goes to Suzi.

00:31:52.188 --> 00:31:53.938
From this moment forth,

00:31:54.355 --> 00:31:55.813
you are all cut off.

00:31:56.855 --> 00:31:58.146
Abandoned.

00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.355
And perhaps,
after I've done you this kindness,

00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:05.480
you will finally be able to make
something of yourselves...

00:32:06.105 --> 00:32:07.230
on your own.

00:32:15.771 --> 00:32:18.771
Apparently, she's had enough of my caviar.

00:32:19.896 --> 00:32:21.480
- That was funny.
- Shh.

00:32:21.563 --> 00:32:22.646
Darling.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.160
You could've signed this at home.

00:32:28.605 --> 00:32:31.188
Instead, you called us here
to humiliate us?

00:32:31.271 --> 00:32:33.730
Yes, and you came running.

00:32:33.813 --> 00:32:35.021
Father, don't do this.

00:32:35.938 --> 00:32:37.146
Or what?

00:32:39.146 --> 00:32:40.188
Yes.

00:32:40.730 --> 00:32:42.105
That's what I thought.

00:32:56.313 --> 00:32:58.563
Don't shoot me!
Don't shoot me, please!

00:32:58.938 --> 00:33:00.396
Daddy!

00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.105
You shot him!

00:33:15.188 --> 00:33:16.355
No!

00:33:16.438 --> 00:33:17.896
I saw someone stab him.

00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:19.438
- Who?
- I don't know.

00:33:19.521 --> 00:33:20.761
What happened? I heard a scr...

00:33:22.021 --> 00:33:23.063
Malcolm!

00:33:23.146 --> 00:33:24.396
Oh, God!

00:33:25.021 --> 00:33:27.021
Has anybody tried to revive him?

00:33:27.105 --> 00:33:30.105
He's got a knife plunged in his heart.
I don't think he's revivable.

00:33:30.188 --> 00:33:31.188
Should we pull it out?

00:33:31.271 --> 00:33:33.521
No. It's a foot-long knife.
It's just like pulling...

00:33:37.313 --> 00:33:38.480
Oh, God!

00:33:38.563 --> 00:33:41.896
Wow! You should have left the knife in
for the po-po, Colonel, man!

00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:43.497
- I'll put it back.
- Don't put it back.

00:33:47.146 --> 00:33:49.480
Oh! Will you listen to my husband?
He's a detective.

00:33:49.563 --> 00:33:51.563
Yes, yes. What should we do, Mr. Officer?

00:33:51.646 --> 00:33:56.188
Well, for starters, let's stop removing
and reinserting the murder weapon

00:33:56.271 --> 00:33:57.730
into the victim's chest.

00:33:57.813 --> 00:34:00.355
In fact, let's stop
touching the body altogether.

00:34:00.438 --> 00:34:02.063
He was gonna take it all away.

00:34:03.355 --> 00:34:04.563
For you.

00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:06.980
Yo...

00:34:07.646 --> 00:34:08.730
Did he sign it?

00:34:13.396 --> 00:34:14.230
No.

00:34:14.313 --> 00:34:15.230
Yes!

00:34:15.313 --> 00:34:17.688
We should make sure
he doesn't have another copy on him.

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:18.813
Uh... Mm-mm.

00:34:18.896 --> 00:34:21.646
Rifling through the pockets of the corpse
counts as touching, yup.

00:34:21.730 --> 00:34:24.480
Sorry to single you out like that,
Ms. Ballard. You're wonderful.

00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:26.914
- You look extravagant tonight.
- Okay. What's next?

00:34:26.938 --> 00:34:28.896
We have to preserve the crime scene.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.688
Captain Wong, is there any way
you can lock off this place?

00:34:32.021 --> 00:34:32.938
Yes, of course.

00:34:33.021 --> 00:34:35.438
So we should then start
questioning the suspects.

00:34:35.730 --> 00:34:36.896
Suspects?

00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.563
We're not questioning anybody.

00:34:38.646 --> 00:34:41.271
Wong, when you finish locking up here,
you bring me the key.

00:34:41.355 --> 00:34:44.730
Then you radio Interpol, tell 'em
we'll meet 'em at the docks in Monaco.

00:34:44.813 --> 00:34:48.021
In the meantime, I'm gonna check
the shrimp out a little closer.

00:34:48.271 --> 00:34:49.563
For the investigation?

00:34:49.646 --> 00:34:51.813
No, Wong, because I'm hungry as shit.

00:34:51.896 --> 00:34:54.896
The rest of you, I'd lock yourselves
in your chambers or your yacht rooms

00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:56.271
because one of us...

00:34:57.521 --> 00:34:58.605
is a murderer.

00:35:04.146 --> 00:35:05.980
- Audrey.
- Yeah?

00:35:06.063 --> 00:35:07.438
Get the cocktail sauce.

00:35:08.063 --> 00:35:09.063
Yep.

00:35:32.313 --> 00:35:34.938
Wait a second. What on earth is on these?

00:35:35.021 --> 00:35:39.105
I don't know. This Maurice guy must
breastfeed each shrimp individually.

00:35:39.188 --> 00:35:40.730
I mean, they live so well.

00:35:40.813 --> 00:35:42.313
- Oh, God, yeah.
- God.

00:35:43.438 --> 00:35:45.313
All right. Where were we?
Okay, okay, okay.

00:35:45.896 --> 00:35:49.105
You know what? There had to be
two people in on the killing.

00:35:49.188 --> 00:35:51.688
Because how could they know
when the lights were gonna go out?

00:35:51.771 --> 00:35:53.605
- That's smart, that's smart.
- Right?

00:35:53.688 --> 00:35:55.855
I'm tired as hell right now.
I'm gonna go to sleep.

00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:57.350
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

00:35:57.646 --> 00:35:58.730
You're not jet-lagged?

00:36:02.688 --> 00:36:04.521
Nick.

00:36:04.605 --> 00:36:06.563
- Honey, come on, seriously.
- Huh?

00:36:06.646 --> 00:36:07.855
Who do you think did it?

00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:10.396
I don't think. I know.

00:36:11.146 --> 00:36:12.146
Who?

00:36:12.355 --> 00:36:13.605
It was the son.

00:36:14.105 --> 00:36:15.771
- Tobey.
- No.

00:36:15.855 --> 00:36:18.980
No way. Not a chance. It's too obvious.

00:36:19.063 --> 00:36:21.605
The most obvious suspect
is never, never the killer.

00:36:21.688 --> 00:36:25.021
The most obvious suspect
is always the killer.

00:36:25.105 --> 00:36:29.855
When a wife gets killed,
90% of the time it was the husband.

00:36:31.313 --> 00:36:33.105
Why did you just use that as an example?

00:36:34.105 --> 00:36:35.146
And I disagree.

00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:37.480
I think people are more complicated
than that.

00:36:39.521 --> 00:36:42.271
Judging off of what?
Those books that you read?

00:36:42.855 --> 00:36:45.271
People are simple, okay?

00:36:45.355 --> 00:36:46.355
It was Tobey.

00:36:46.396 --> 00:36:49.896
He had the most to gain,
and he also had the most to lose.

00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:52.646
Which is exactly why he's not the killer.

00:36:54.271 --> 00:36:56.271
Did you ever fool around on a boat?

00:36:56.813 --> 00:36:58.373
Do you know how much fun that could be?

00:36:58.438 --> 00:37:00.521
I just lay here
and the boat does all the work.

00:37:00.605 --> 00:37:02.956
- That's so convenient for you.
- You know I have a bad back.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:04.480
So convenient for you.

00:37:05.855 --> 00:37:07.396
What about the lights?

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.563
Yeah, leave 'em on. I don't care.
Either way. Lady's choice.

00:37:10.646 --> 00:37:13.230
Shh! No. Who turned out those lights?

00:37:15.938 --> 00:37:17.646
What?! Oh!

00:37:28.396 --> 00:37:30.521
Don't look at me like that. I can feel it.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.956
- I'm sorry. Excuse me.
- Will you take the Allegra?

00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.146
It's the same stuff.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:06.105
- I don't want to talk about it.
- Oh, God.

00:38:09.396 --> 00:38:11.563
Enter the brilliant
yet tortured detective,

00:38:11.855 --> 00:38:12.855
right on cue.

00:38:13.605 --> 00:38:14.730
<i>Mesdames, messieurs.</i>

00:38:16.771 --> 00:38:19.480
My name is Inspector Laurent Delacroix.

00:38:21.313 --> 00:38:25.355
I will now summon you one by one
to the grand lounge for questioning.

00:38:31.521 --> 00:38:34.063
Why is that smoke ring so good?
How did he do that?

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.521
Oh, you broke it. You broke it.

00:38:50.188 --> 00:38:51.771
Tell me about Malcolm Quince.

00:38:52.271 --> 00:38:54.646
He was the most wonderful...

00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:55.855
Swine.

00:38:55.938 --> 00:38:57.980
He was the love of my life.

00:38:58.063 --> 00:39:00.188
He was a complicated man.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:03.313
Describe to me what happened.

00:39:03.896 --> 00:39:08.688
Yo, Mr. French Policeman, man.
It was mad. Lights went out.

00:39:08.771 --> 00:39:11.230
I thought I saw something move,
and I shot.

00:39:14.063 --> 00:39:14.980
Yes.

00:39:15.063 --> 00:39:15.896
Finish line.

00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.063
The old man got what was coming to him.

00:39:18.146 --> 00:39:19.896
One-eight-seven, motherfu...

00:39:22.146 --> 00:39:23.938
Did anyone touch the body?

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:26.813
No.

00:39:26.896 --> 00:39:30.605
And did you notice anything else
out of the ordinary?

00:39:31.480 --> 00:39:33.980
- The Americans.
- Yes, number one. Yes.

00:39:37.938 --> 00:39:39.646
Aren't you gonna, um...

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:41.188
Aren't you gonna separate us?

00:39:43.188 --> 00:39:44.188
<i>Pardon?</i>

00:39:44.521 --> 00:39:46.230
- For the interrogation.
- Okay.

00:39:46.313 --> 00:39:47.938
Question us separately, see if our...

00:39:48.021 --> 00:39:49.855
- What are you doing?
- ...answers match.

00:39:49.938 --> 00:39:52.730
What? I'm just saying,
our answers will match

00:39:52.813 --> 00:39:54.653
- because we're innocent.
- Yeah, that's right.

00:39:56.146 --> 00:39:57.063
There we go.

00:39:57.146 --> 00:39:59.688
God, you are really good at that.

00:39:59.938 --> 00:40:03.313
We found this in Tobey Quince's suite.

00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.188
A typewritten suicide note

00:40:06.271 --> 00:40:09.021
in which he confesses
to the murder of his father.

00:40:09.605 --> 00:40:10.438
Typewritten?

00:40:10.521 --> 00:40:12.688
- Mm-mm.
- That's not very common.

00:40:13.146 --> 00:40:14.896
- Very suspicious.
- Yes.

00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:18.313
Yeah, obviously someone is trying
to frame Tobey for his father's murder.

00:40:19.313 --> 00:40:21.771
- This is amazing.
- Look how excited she is.

00:40:21.855 --> 00:40:23.655
So where's your head at
with this whole thing?

00:40:23.730 --> 00:40:25.313
I mean, who are your chief suspects?

00:40:26.688 --> 00:40:27.521
You.

00:40:27.605 --> 00:40:29.605
- Woo, yes.
- Right, of course,

00:40:29.688 --> 00:40:33.063
- 'cause everybody is a suspect.
- Especially her.

00:40:33.146 --> 00:40:36.605
This is a group of friends and family
who have known each other for years.

00:40:36.688 --> 00:40:39.688
You two show up, and ten hours later,
two of them are dead.

00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:41.438
Coincidence?

00:40:41.813 --> 00:40:43.396
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:44.813
- Coincidence.
- Wait. Excuse me.

00:40:44.896 --> 00:40:46.396
Are you saying that your theory

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.688
is that the two of us conned our way
onto a stranger's boat at the last minute

00:40:50.771 --> 00:40:54.771
to commit premeditated murder
that benefits us in no way?

00:40:54.855 --> 00:40:55.855
That's your theory?

00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:57.771
Perhaps someone paid you to do it.

00:40:57.855 --> 00:40:59.438
- No.
- Paid us to do it?

00:40:59.521 --> 00:41:02.313
Oh, my gosh. I would love to see that.
Show me that money.

00:41:02.396 --> 00:41:04.355
Do you want to see
our bank statements?

00:41:04.730 --> 00:41:06.688
We're broke.

00:41:06.771 --> 00:41:08.730
Desperate for money. I see.

00:41:08.813 --> 00:41:10.771
Now you gave him a motive.

00:41:10.855 --> 00:41:13.081
- No, no, no. I know. Just don't...
- We did this because...

00:41:13.105 --> 00:41:15.081
- ...take my words out of context.
- We got nothing.

00:41:15.105 --> 00:41:16.581
- That's all we got, is nothing.
- No.

00:41:16.605 --> 00:41:19.896
Listen, I am talking to you,
detective to detective.

00:41:20.438 --> 00:41:21.438
We didn't do this.

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.938
- You can see in my eyes. You can tell.
- Mm-mm.

00:41:24.438 --> 00:41:27.688
Perhaps I will have
that word with you independently.

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:29.646
I di... Hey!

00:41:30.980 --> 00:41:31.896
I can get up.

00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.313
Hey, okay.

00:41:33.396 --> 00:41:34.813
I'll be out in a minute.

00:41:35.313 --> 00:41:36.396
I love you.

00:41:36.480 --> 00:41:39.063
I'm sorry. She's just excited
because it's...

00:41:39.146 --> 00:41:41.563
She reads books, and this is fun for her.

00:41:43.896 --> 00:41:46.521
You wish me to believe you're innocent.

00:41:46.605 --> 00:41:49.021
Unfortunately, I do not believe liars.

00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:50.605
But I'm telling you the truth.

00:41:50.688 --> 00:41:53.146
And how long
have you been lying to your wife?

00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:54.230
Excuse me?

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:57.980
You did not think that we would
investigate your background,

00:41:58.438 --> 00:42:01.896
Sergeant Nicholas Spitz, NYPD?

00:42:02.355 --> 00:42:05.730
Failed his detective's exam three times.

00:42:05.813 --> 00:42:07.938
You are, how you do say,

00:42:08.021 --> 00:42:09.271
cop on the beat,

00:42:09.355 --> 00:42:11.438
not detective as you so claim.

00:42:12.188 --> 00:42:13.188
So I...

00:42:14.188 --> 00:42:15.771
tell people I'm a detective.

00:42:15.855 --> 00:42:17.063
There's...

00:42:17.146 --> 00:42:18.355
That's not a crime.

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:21.563
Impersonating a detective <i>is </i>a crime.

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:23.380
I didn't think it was a crime here.

00:42:23.438 --> 00:42:25.198
I thought maybe you guys
had different rules.

00:42:25.646 --> 00:42:27.355
That doesn't make us murderers.

00:42:27.438 --> 00:42:31.021
A broke, failed man, lying to his wife?
I think it does.

00:42:31.313 --> 00:42:33.813
You don't have any evidence.
You can't hold us.

00:42:33.896 --> 00:42:36.230
No, but I can hold these.

00:42:37.438 --> 00:42:40.938
I believe Mr. Cavendish has provided
accommodations for you

00:42:41.021 --> 00:42:44.105
at the Hotel de Savoie,
so you won't be on the street.

00:42:44.771 --> 00:42:47.730
But mark my words, Officer Spitz,

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:52.021
I will not rest until I prove
that you committed these murders.

00:42:52.646 --> 00:42:53.646
And I...

00:42:54.438 --> 00:42:57.813
will rest, because I'm tired as shit,
at that hotel you just said.

00:42:57.896 --> 00:42:59.396
It sounds like a good one.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.063
But after I'm well-rested
and I eat breakfast...

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:04.771
hopefully the guy cooks
as good as Maurice...

00:43:05.605 --> 00:43:08.146
I will not rest until I prove to you

00:43:08.230 --> 00:43:10.521
we have nothing to do with these murders.

00:43:15.355 --> 00:43:16.188
Juan Carlos!

00:43:16.271 --> 00:43:17.480
Juan Carlos!

00:43:21.021 --> 00:43:23.381
Charles said
that everyone's gonna be at this race,

00:43:23.438 --> 00:43:25.271
so whoever did this is gonna be there.

00:43:25.355 --> 00:43:26.646
We have to figure out who it is.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.855
I know we've gotta figure it out.
This isn't one of your books, sweetheart.

00:43:29.938 --> 00:43:32.396
I mean, it's like one of your books,
but this is real.

00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:34.605
Like, two people are dead, for real.

00:43:34.688 --> 00:43:36.664
- I know.
- There's a real killer on the real loose.

00:43:36.688 --> 00:43:37.855
Hey, babe. Relax.

00:43:37.938 --> 00:43:39.521
What's... What's wrong with you?

00:43:39.605 --> 00:43:42.271
For real? Come on. Will you just focus...

00:43:42.355 --> 00:43:43.414
- Fine.
- ...on this with me?

00:43:43.438 --> 00:43:45.021
Um, yes. Uh...

00:43:45.105 --> 00:43:48.021
Okay. So there are three basic
motives for every murder.

00:43:48.105 --> 00:43:50.021
Yes. The first one is money.

00:43:50.105 --> 00:43:50.980
Right.

00:43:51.063 --> 00:43:53.021
Everyone was in Quince's will,
except Suzi.

00:43:53.105 --> 00:43:55.063
- Okay.
- All right. The second one is love.

00:43:55.146 --> 00:43:57.506
We know nobody loved that guy
'cause he was kind of a prick.

00:43:57.563 --> 00:43:58.646
Suzi might have loved him.

00:43:58.730 --> 00:44:01.039
- That's what you would think...
- Okay, what's the third one?

00:44:01.063 --> 00:44:02.230
- Revenge.
- Right.

00:44:02.313 --> 00:44:03.993
That's the one
we should be thinking about.

00:44:04.021 --> 00:44:06.456
I'm telling you, if we figure out
who hates this guy the most,

00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.355
that's our killer.

00:44:07.438 --> 00:44:08.771
Okay. Okay.

00:44:18.438 --> 00:44:21.146
So, this beard... It's incredible.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:24.021
Do you oil that or condition?

00:44:24.105 --> 00:44:25.605
You won't get anything out of him.

00:44:25.688 --> 00:44:27.021
Oh, my gosh.

00:44:27.105 --> 00:44:30.146
Most of his life, he's been serving men
like me and Malcolm,

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.355
despite being an heir to millions.

00:44:32.438 --> 00:44:33.646
He's rich, too?

00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:36.063
He's supposed to be,
but he's one of 16 children,

00:44:36.146 --> 00:44:38.063
and he's half French.

00:44:38.146 --> 00:44:40.605
Are you familiar
with French inheritance law?

00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:41.980
Broad strokes.

00:44:42.021 --> 00:44:44.480
That Colonel guy,
he's getting on my nerves.

00:44:44.563 --> 00:44:46.146
- Yeah.
- Shit. Walking around

00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:47.872
- saying you killed both those guys.
- Huh?

00:44:47.896 --> 00:44:49.105
- Yeah.
- What?

00:44:49.188 --> 00:44:50.605
And I'm like, come on.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:54.313
- My man wouldn't do...
- Yo. Look, yo. I didn't do nothing, son.

00:44:54.396 --> 00:44:56.563
- It doesn't matter what the will says.
- Uh-huh.

00:44:56.646 --> 00:44:59.521
The fortune must be divided equally
among the offspring.

00:44:59.605 --> 00:45:01.438
Why do the French have such a law?

00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:05.730
Well, they do it to keep all Frenchmen
from doing what Malcolm was trying to do,

00:45:05.813 --> 00:45:08.271
and leaving everything
to their mistresses.

00:45:08.355 --> 00:45:09.396
Oh.

00:45:10.313 --> 00:45:11.730
- My theory is...
- Yeah?

00:45:12.105 --> 00:45:13.438
...Juan Carlos done it, man.

00:45:13.521 --> 00:45:15.188
What? Why would he do that?

00:45:15.271 --> 00:45:17.938
Well, Juan Carlos's dad
used to race for Malcolm.

00:45:18.021 --> 00:45:22.063
Malcolm tried to get slick on some
safety angle, and shit got overlooked.

00:45:22.146 --> 00:45:23.396
- Yeah?
- Okay.

00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:28.271
Juan Carlos's dad lost both his legs, G.

00:45:28.355 --> 00:45:30.313
Yeah, straight up.

00:45:30.396 --> 00:45:31.480
- Oh.
- Gone.

00:45:31.563 --> 00:45:32.771
So it's payback time.

00:45:32.855 --> 00:45:34.438
A hundred percent of a doubt.

00:45:35.105 --> 00:45:36.105
Wh-What?

00:45:36.271 --> 00:45:38.355
- Juan Carlos is your man.
- Oh, yeah.

00:45:38.438 --> 00:45:39.605
You guarantee that?

00:45:39.688 --> 00:45:40.688
Guarantee.

00:45:40.771 --> 00:45:42.105
Respect.

00:45:43.021 --> 00:45:44.771
Or maybe Sergei could have done it.

00:45:46.396 --> 00:45:48.563
- Yeah.
- Okay. So you're not guaranteeing it.

00:45:48.646 --> 00:45:49.938
No, not a hundred percent. No.

00:45:54.271 --> 00:45:56.438
Oh! Bless you.

00:45:57.105 --> 00:45:58.563
Would you like some Allegra?

00:45:59.063 --> 00:46:01.396
- I doubt that would be useful.
- I know.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.688
It doesn't work.
I tried to tell that to Nick.

00:46:06.396 --> 00:46:07.730
Do you need something?

00:46:08.313 --> 00:46:10.271
Uh, no. Mm-mm.

00:46:11.105 --> 00:46:14.230
The guy that throws me off the most...
Cavendish...

00:46:14.313 --> 00:46:18.271
to me, he seems like
he's compensating for something,

00:46:18.355 --> 00:46:20.396
with the <i>Great Gatsby</i> look and the jawline

00:46:20.480 --> 00:46:22.730
and the "hey, I'm so gorgeous."
Am I right?

00:46:22.813 --> 00:46:23.688
Mm-hmm.

00:46:23.771 --> 00:46:26.230
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with Charles Cavendish.

00:46:26.313 --> 00:46:27.980
- Isn't that the...
- Except...

00:46:28.563 --> 00:46:30.480
he probably murdered his uncle.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:33.230
Well, that's one thing wrong.

00:46:34.855 --> 00:46:36.730
<i>...comes to the checkered flag!</i>

00:46:36.813 --> 00:46:38.188
<i>It's Juan Carlos!</i>

00:46:39.271 --> 00:46:42.188
<i>Winner of this year's
Monte Carlo Grand Prix!</i>

00:46:42.271 --> 00:46:44.271
<i>I find that Suzi Nakamura very suspicious.</i>

00:46:44.313 --> 00:46:46.355
<i>She's the only one
who didn't have a motive.</i>

00:46:46.438 --> 00:46:49.414
- It was Cavendish and you know it.
- You just... No, you just don't like him.

00:46:49.438 --> 00:46:52.355
I don't like him. I don't.
I hate his guts, but that's not it.

00:46:52.438 --> 00:46:55.188
- Did you just steal all of those?
- He's the sole blood heir.

00:46:55.271 --> 00:46:58.146
He stands to make
the biggest claim for the fortune.

00:46:58.230 --> 00:46:59.230
I want one of these.

00:46:59.271 --> 00:47:01.730
- Malcolm stole his fiancée.
- Okay.

00:47:01.813 --> 00:47:03.521
That's all three motives.

00:47:03.605 --> 00:47:05.396
Money, love, revenge.

00:47:05.480 --> 00:47:07.188
We went past it.
I don't know where we are.

00:47:07.271 --> 00:47:09.231
We're over here.
Will you please try one of these?

00:47:09.271 --> 00:47:11.146
No! Oh, my God. You know what?

00:47:11.646 --> 00:47:14.438
I think you just think it's Cavendish
'cause you're jealous of him.

00:47:14.521 --> 00:47:16.271
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

00:47:16.355 --> 00:47:18.271
- I'm jealous of him.
- You are.

00:47:18.355 --> 00:47:19.896
What? Why? What am I jealous of?

00:47:19.980 --> 00:47:22.938
What is there to be jealous...
He's rich. He's charming.

00:47:23.521 --> 00:47:24.980
He smells great.

00:47:25.063 --> 00:47:26.646
What do you mean? What's he smell like?

00:47:26.730 --> 00:47:29.230
He smells like
he just came out of the dryer.

00:47:32.771 --> 00:47:34.396
What the... What the...

00:47:38.438 --> 00:47:39.605
No, no, no.

00:47:39.688 --> 00:47:41.188
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

00:47:41.271 --> 00:47:42.951
We should test that
for fingerprints first.

00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:45.271
Okay. Do you have
the fingerprint testing kit?

00:47:45.646 --> 00:47:47.271
- What?
- 'Cause I didn't pack mine.

00:47:47.355 --> 00:47:48.396
Is it in your bag?

00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:49.646
Stop it! Come on.

00:47:50.563 --> 00:47:51.563
Hurry.

00:47:52.063 --> 00:47:53.646
Oh, this is so crazy.

00:47:55.396 --> 00:47:57.146
Oh, God. Seriously?

00:47:59.271 --> 00:48:00.521
Oh, got it.

00:48:00.605 --> 00:48:02.438
Will you please
just go see a chiropractor?

00:48:02.521 --> 00:48:03.563
It's gonna be fine.

00:48:04.813 --> 00:48:07.646
"Come to suite 802."

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:09.063
<i>♪ Dum, dum, dum ♪</i>

00:48:09.146 --> 00:48:11.646
- We have to go to 802.
- We're not going to 802. Stop!

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:12.813
- Why?
- It's a trap.

00:48:12.896 --> 00:48:15.336
Why wouldn't whoever just knocked
just come in and talk to us?

00:48:15.605 --> 00:48:17.165
Maybe he's being watched by the killer.

00:48:17.230 --> 00:48:19.355
What if we're being watched by the killer?

00:48:20.021 --> 00:48:21.230
What if he was in here?

00:48:21.938 --> 00:48:24.063
Maybe he stole my Peanut M&Ms.

00:48:24.146 --> 00:48:26.105
I stole your Peanut M&Ms.

00:48:26.521 --> 00:48:27.521
You stole my Peanut M&Ms?

00:48:27.605 --> 00:48:29.872
- I wanted to see if they tasted the same!
- You got to stop eating.

00:48:29.896 --> 00:48:31.188
You're gonna gain it all back.

00:48:31.271 --> 00:48:33.063
I'm going to 802. Are you coming with me?

00:48:33.146 --> 00:48:34.813
Okay, wait. Let me just...

00:48:34.896 --> 00:48:36.896
- What?
- ...figure something out.

00:48:37.646 --> 00:48:38.730
God damn.

00:48:43.355 --> 00:48:45.688
- What are you doing?
- It's a weapon.

00:48:45.771 --> 00:48:46.646
That's a lamp.

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.063
Not when I crack someone
over the head with it.

00:48:49.146 --> 00:48:50.826
Will you stop questioning everything I do.

00:48:50.855 --> 00:48:52.455
Well, everything you do is questionable.

00:49:02.105 --> 00:49:03.313
That's 808.

00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:16.980
Hello?

00:49:18.813 --> 00:49:19.813
Note sender?

00:49:22.313 --> 00:49:24.563
You told us to come to 802. Are you there?

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.480
Are you dead?

00:49:28.271 --> 00:49:29.688
He might be in the bathroom.

00:49:34.438 --> 00:49:36.438
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

00:49:36.521 --> 00:49:37.841
Sit on the bed.

00:49:37.896 --> 00:49:39.605
You speak... I thought you didn't speak.

00:49:39.688 --> 00:49:41.188
Shut up. Sit on the bed.

00:49:41.271 --> 00:49:42.581
- I'm sitting!
- Shut up. Sit down.

00:49:42.605 --> 00:49:45.271
We're gonna sit in front of the bed.
All good.

00:49:46.021 --> 00:49:48.105
I cannot keep his secrets anymore.

00:49:48.688 --> 00:49:50.438
You mean the Colonel's, right?

00:49:50.521 --> 00:49:53.938
The Colonel's secrets?
I know, it's so hard to keep secrets.

00:49:54.021 --> 00:49:56.230
It really is.
You know, I have a friend named Gwen,

00:49:56.313 --> 00:49:58.233
and she has a box
that she keeps under her bed...

00:49:58.271 --> 00:50:00.146
Look, don't give me that hairdresser shit.

00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:01.855
Just shut up. Listen.

00:50:03.105 --> 00:50:05.438
Copenhagen, 1994.

00:50:07.271 --> 00:50:09.105
We were leaving a state dinner.

00:50:11.063 --> 00:50:12.938
I did not see the bomber,

00:50:14.021 --> 00:50:15.480
but the Colonel did.

00:50:15.771 --> 00:50:16.605
Whoa.

00:50:16.688 --> 00:50:19.563
He threw his body across Mr. Quince.

00:50:20.688 --> 00:50:21.896
He was hero.

00:50:22.605 --> 00:50:25.438
For nine months,
the Colonel lay in a coma.

00:50:26.563 --> 00:50:27.980
And when he awoke,

00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:33.230
he find his eye
is not the only thing he lost.

00:50:33.313 --> 00:50:35.563
They blew off his dick.
I knew it. I knew it.

00:50:35.646 --> 00:50:38.039
- His hand. His hand, honey.
- The dick. He's saying the dick.

00:50:38.063 --> 00:50:39.583
- No, no, no.
- He doesn't have a hand!

00:50:39.646 --> 00:50:41.438
- I'm no talk about dick!
- All right.

00:50:43.063 --> 00:50:44.646
I talk about her.

00:50:44.730 --> 00:50:45.938
- Me?
- Her?

00:50:46.021 --> 00:50:47.021
No, no, no.

00:50:50.563 --> 00:50:51.938
Madeleine...

00:50:52.396 --> 00:50:53.896
LeBoutillier.

00:50:55.938 --> 00:50:58.730
The most beautiful woman I have ever seen.

00:50:59.646 --> 00:51:03.480
She was the Colonel's fiancée
when the bomb exploded.

00:51:04.980 --> 00:51:06.438
And when he awoke...

00:51:08.146 --> 00:51:10.230
she was Mr. Quince's wife.

00:51:10.688 --> 00:51:12.021
What the hell is with this guy?

00:51:12.105 --> 00:51:14.831
- What, honestly, is his problem?
- Can he get his own woman maybe once?

00:51:14.855 --> 00:51:16.188
And then she died.

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:17.646
No!

00:51:18.021 --> 00:51:19.188
In childbirth.

00:51:19.271 --> 00:51:20.146
- No!
- Damn.

00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:22.230
The child died, too. A boy.

00:51:22.688 --> 00:51:25.021
A boy who would have inherited it all.

00:51:25.938 --> 00:51:29.438
After that, the Colonel never mentioned
Madeleine again,

00:51:31.271 --> 00:51:33.230
except for one night.

00:51:33.313 --> 00:51:35.271
On the anniversary of her death,

00:51:35.646 --> 00:51:38.438
he came to me, he was drinking. He say...

00:51:40.355 --> 00:51:41.355
"Sergei."

00:51:41.688 --> 00:51:42.980
He's doing impressions now.

00:51:43.396 --> 00:51:46.855
"If you were to kill this Mr. Quince,

00:51:46.938 --> 00:51:48.396
how would you do it?"

00:51:49.313 --> 00:51:50.480
And I say,

00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.688
"Find isolated place,

00:51:54.313 --> 00:51:56.188
create confusion,

00:51:56.271 --> 00:51:59.105
make sure there are others with motive."

00:52:00.063 --> 00:52:02.938
I told him how to kill the man!

00:52:03.355 --> 00:52:05.938
- Holy shit! This is incredible!
- Thank you.

00:52:06.021 --> 00:52:09.188
Okay. So the Colonel killed Malcolm
and Tobey over lost love.

00:52:09.271 --> 00:52:10.622
- Got it. Perfect.
- This is insane.

00:52:10.646 --> 00:52:12.605
Will you just say
all of that one more time,

00:52:12.688 --> 00:52:14.146
but can you say it from the top?

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:16.372
- I've gotta do a voice memo.
- She screws this up a lot.

00:52:16.396 --> 00:52:18.688
- Just ask Siri.
- Swipe it up.

00:52:18.771 --> 00:52:19.956
- Swipe it up.
- I did swipe up.

00:52:19.980 --> 00:52:20.813
Say, "Siri,

00:52:20.896 --> 00:52:23.039
I would like to make voice memo."

00:52:26.271 --> 00:52:28.355
Get into wardrobe. You are in danger.

00:52:28.438 --> 00:52:30.956
- Get in the wardrobe, you said?
- You are in danger. Right now.

00:52:30.980 --> 00:52:33.188
- Quickly.
- Jesus. I don't know... Ow!

00:52:33.813 --> 00:52:36.688
And whatever you hear,
do not come out till I say so.

00:52:36.771 --> 00:52:37.813
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

00:52:40.396 --> 00:52:41.980
You. What do you want?

00:52:43.271 --> 00:52:45.646
No, they're not here. You should go.

00:52:49.146 --> 00:52:50.646
Where's the lamp?

00:52:51.105 --> 00:52:53.730
- I left it outside.
- Why isn't it in here?

00:52:53.813 --> 00:52:56.438
- Now you like the lamp? You're ridiculous.
- Well, we needed...

00:52:56.521 --> 00:52:59.021
- Let me open the door.
- Wait, wait, wait!

00:52:59.105 --> 00:53:00.730
Sh.

00:53:03.938 --> 00:53:05.063
Oh, thank God.

00:53:05.563 --> 00:53:06.563
Killer...

00:53:07.021 --> 00:53:07.896
is...

00:53:07.980 --> 00:53:09.230
What?

00:53:10.980 --> 00:53:12.438
Oh, God, no! No, no, no!

00:53:12.521 --> 00:53:14.313
Oh, my God!

00:53:14.396 --> 00:53:15.855
Is he dead? Is he dead?

00:53:16.771 --> 00:53:17.771
He's dead!

00:53:18.313 --> 00:53:19.646
Do we call housekeeping?

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:21.271
Oh! Honey!

00:53:21.355 --> 00:53:23.063
Oh, my God!

00:53:23.896 --> 00:53:25.021
Lock the door!

00:53:25.105 --> 00:53:26.521
Oh, God!

00:53:26.605 --> 00:53:28.105
Oh, my God.

00:53:29.771 --> 00:53:30.855
Go! Out of the window!

00:53:30.938 --> 00:53:33.646
What are you doing?

00:53:34.688 --> 00:53:36.230
Okay, there's a ledge.

00:53:36.313 --> 00:53:38.146
That's not a ledge, that's an edge!

00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:40.063
- Here we go.
- Oh, my God.

00:53:40.146 --> 00:53:43.188
I gotcha, a hundred percent.
A hundred percent. Slow.

00:53:43.271 --> 00:53:45.646
- Oh, right there.
- No! Oh, God.

00:53:45.730 --> 00:53:46.938
Come on.

00:53:47.021 --> 00:53:48.563
- Don't even look down.
- Oh!

00:53:48.646 --> 00:53:49.886
- Don't look down.
- Oh, my God!

00:53:49.938 --> 00:53:52.021
- Told you not to look down.
- It's so far.

00:53:52.105 --> 00:53:53.265
Oh, my God.

00:54:01.896 --> 00:54:04.271
He flosses angrier than you!

00:54:10.438 --> 00:54:12.063
We got an empty room. Jackpot.

00:54:12.146 --> 00:54:14.106
- Okay, we're gonna get up on this letter.
- Okay.

00:54:14.188 --> 00:54:16.021
Ready? Go.

00:54:17.938 --> 00:54:18.980
God!

00:54:19.063 --> 00:54:20.188
Oh, my God!

00:54:22.063 --> 00:54:23.997
- You okay? Come on.
- That was the scariest thing.

00:54:24.021 --> 00:54:26.855
- We gotta go. All right. I love you.
- Oh, my God.

00:54:26.938 --> 00:54:29.289
- I love you. I'm so scared.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go.

00:54:32.105 --> 00:54:34.355
Uh... What's in here? Uh...

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.230
No, you're not going back out there.

00:54:38.396 --> 00:54:40.271
- Oh, yes! Finally!
- Come here.

00:54:40.938 --> 00:54:42.313
- Kiss me, Vik.
- Oh!

00:54:42.396 --> 00:54:44.105
Oh, kiss me. Kiss me here.

00:54:44.188 --> 00:54:45.271
- Where?
- Here.

00:54:45.355 --> 00:54:47.730
- God, I love it. Quick, get me to the bed.
- Jesus Christ.

00:54:47.813 --> 00:54:48.980
- Get up.
- Yes!

00:54:49.063 --> 00:54:52.021
I'm gonna drink you up
like a milkshake without a straw!

00:54:52.105 --> 00:54:53.646
Yeah. Wow!

00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:55.289
- That's right.
- Vanilla milkshake!

00:54:55.313 --> 00:54:57.188
Vanilla, chocolate, whatever!

00:54:57.271 --> 00:54:58.146
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:54:58.230 --> 00:54:59.438
- Here we go!
- Wow!

00:54:59.521 --> 00:55:02.438
Yeah! I hope the hotel's
got insurance for these springs

00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:03.980
'cause I'm gonna bust this bed up.

00:55:04.063 --> 00:55:05.063
Oh, my God!

00:55:05.105 --> 00:55:07.289
- You're much stronger than you look, Vik!
- That's right!

00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:10.980
- You ready for this?
- I don't know if I am!

00:55:11.063 --> 00:55:12.980
Oh, Grace!

00:55:13.355 --> 00:55:16.563
- Grace! Oh, Grace!
- Huh? Why do you keep saying Grace?

00:55:16.646 --> 00:55:18.747
Darling, it's the only thing
that gets me in the mood.

00:55:18.771 --> 00:55:22.396
Grace!
You look so good for your age!

00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:25.938
- <i>So </i>good for your age! Oh, God!
- Your skin is beautiful!

00:55:26.021 --> 00:55:29.146
- You have no wrinkles...
- No wrinkles any...

00:55:29.230 --> 00:55:30.105
Anywhere!

00:55:30.188 --> 00:55:32.980
Oh, my God! Grace, you're so...

00:55:33.063 --> 00:55:34.146
Oh, God!

00:55:36.938 --> 00:55:38.258
- Uh-oh.
- Vik.

00:55:38.313 --> 00:55:39.355
Mm-hmm?

00:55:39.438 --> 00:55:40.521
What happened?

00:55:41.605 --> 00:55:44.188
Maybe we should,
like, conversate a little bit.

00:55:44.271 --> 00:55:45.911
Get to know each other. Know what I mean?

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:49.271
Like, eye to eye, really connect.
Tell me about your favorite band.

00:55:50.396 --> 00:55:53.855
I'm going to the casino.
Maybe I'll get lucky there.

00:55:53.938 --> 00:55:56.813
Look, look, look!
Please don't tell anybody about this

00:55:56.896 --> 00:55:59.063
'cause I've got some mad sex cred
in these parts, yeah.

00:55:59.146 --> 00:56:00.271
My people know me.

00:56:00.355 --> 00:56:01.646
I'll buy you a hat!

00:56:03.313 --> 00:56:05.438
I can't believe this just happened.

00:56:05.521 --> 00:56:06.896
Okay, okay.

00:56:08.396 --> 00:56:09.938
All right. We gotta calm down.

00:56:10.021 --> 00:56:12.146
- This has been a really weird day, huh?
- Yeah.

00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:14.021
Okay. Let's just get out of this place.

00:56:14.105 --> 00:56:17.646
Absolutely.
Someplace with beer though, please.

00:56:17.730 --> 00:56:19.146
"I'll go buy you a hat."

00:56:22.063 --> 00:56:24.938
Sergei was trying to tell us
the Colonel did it,

00:56:25.021 --> 00:56:28.063
but then he gets shot.
There's no way the Colonel shot him

00:56:28.146 --> 00:56:29.866
'cause the Colonel was having
a floss party.

00:56:29.896 --> 00:56:32.216
Did you see how crazy he was going
with the teeth flossing?

00:56:32.271 --> 00:56:34.605
- I did.
- What did he have in there? A buffet?

00:56:38.813 --> 00:56:40.521
- Um...
- Oh, my gosh.

00:56:45.563 --> 00:56:47.313
- What's he saying?
- I don't know.

00:56:47.396 --> 00:56:49.521
Well, you took French in high school,
didn't you?

00:56:49.605 --> 00:56:52.730
I don't remember high school!
What did you take in high school?

00:56:52.813 --> 00:56:54.938
- Latin.
- Oh, great. Who takes freakin' Latin?

00:56:55.021 --> 00:56:56.781
- People who have a hot Latin teacher.
- Shh!

00:56:59.146 --> 00:57:01.313
Okay, so something, something...

00:57:01.396 --> 00:57:03.646
Something cake. Something's frosted.

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:05.050
Okay. You're fired. You're fired.

00:57:05.105 --> 00:57:06.688
- Okay, I told you...
- Excuse me, sir.

00:57:06.771 --> 00:57:09.605
Could you translate that for us, please?
<i>S'il vous plaît?</i>

00:57:10.021 --> 00:57:12.063
Uh, the TV says that, uh...

00:57:12.730 --> 00:57:14.980
you are the most wanted... for...

00:57:16.063 --> 00:57:17.063
for <i>meurtre.</i>

00:57:17.146 --> 00:57:18.855
- No, no, no.
- Okay, no, no. We...

00:57:18.938 --> 00:57:20.855
This is a complete misunderstanding, okay?

00:57:20.938 --> 00:57:22.355
We were just around...

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:24.563
- We saw...
- ...a lot of people that happened to die,

00:57:24.646 --> 00:57:25.771
but we didn't <i>murt.</i>

00:57:25.855 --> 00:57:28.646
You are to be arrested at first sight.

00:57:28.730 --> 00:57:30.230
- Us?
- So, here's what we do.

00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:32.855
What are you talking about?
What are you doing?

00:57:32.938 --> 00:57:34.855
They can't track our SIM card now.

00:57:34.938 --> 00:57:36.855
Yeah, then pull the SIM card out.

00:57:36.938 --> 00:57:39.355
You don't just submerge our phones
into a bucket of beer.

00:57:39.438 --> 00:57:43.063
Now... Now he's saying
that madame is hairdresser,

00:57:43.146 --> 00:57:45.313
you are, uh... police officer?

00:57:45.771 --> 00:57:47.271
No, he's... he's a detective.

00:57:47.563 --> 00:57:48.688
Ah. No, he's not.

00:57:48.771 --> 00:57:50.206
- Yes, he is.
- Yes, I am! Yes, I am!

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:52.688
No, no, no.
He says that you have, uh, confessed

00:57:52.771 --> 00:57:54.563
to lying about that you are detective.

00:57:54.855 --> 00:57:56.646
What? No. Now he's making stuff up.

00:57:56.730 --> 00:57:59.480
TV says you have failed
your detective exam many, many times.

00:57:59.563 --> 00:58:01.980
All right! Enough <i>translato.</i> That's not...

00:58:02.063 --> 00:58:04.271
You're just improvising, pal,
and it's getting weird.

00:58:04.355 --> 00:58:05.675
What... What is he talking about?

00:58:05.730 --> 00:58:07.690
<i>I will repeat this message
in English.</i>

00:58:08.146 --> 00:58:09.313
<i>Nick Spitz...</i>

00:58:09.730 --> 00:58:11.021
<i>is many things,</i>

00:58:11.105 --> 00:58:12.396
<i>but not a detective.</i>

00:58:14.813 --> 00:58:15.938
Well, I heard that.

00:58:16.021 --> 00:58:18.063
<i>I will repeat this message
in Spanish.</i>

00:58:18.146 --> 00:58:19.271
Did you lie to me?

00:58:20.313 --> 00:58:21.855
I didn't... I didn't lie.

00:58:21.938 --> 00:58:23.898
- The guy... The guy was...
- Oh, God. No, no, no.

00:58:24.688 --> 00:58:26.396
Whoa. Hey.

00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:28.396
- No.
- Hun, hun, hun.

00:58:28.646 --> 00:58:31.230
This whole thing's just...
just very complicated.

00:58:31.313 --> 00:58:34.271
Complicated, yeah.
I thought people were simple.

00:58:34.355 --> 00:58:36.396
Audrey, please.

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.230
What? Did you lie
about getting that raise, too?

00:58:41.271 --> 00:58:43.480
How are we affording this trip?

00:58:44.563 --> 00:58:47.730
You made me feel like
I had to take you on this honeymoon.

00:58:47.813 --> 00:58:51.105
You told me
you already booked this honeymoon.

00:58:51.521 --> 00:58:53.730
You gave this to me.
This was my anniversary gift.

00:58:53.813 --> 00:58:55.438
- Okay.
- You lied about that, too?

00:58:55.521 --> 00:58:56.980
We'll get into all that, okay?

00:58:57.063 --> 00:59:00.563
But right now, I gotta figure out
how we're gonna get out of this situation.

00:59:00.646 --> 00:59:03.480
You have to figure this out?
What do you think I've been doing?

00:59:03.563 --> 00:59:05.355
This is what I do for a living,
sweetheart!

00:59:05.438 --> 00:59:07.146
You're a goddamn hairdresser!

00:59:09.521 --> 00:59:10.605
- I'm sorry.
- Whoa.

00:59:13.271 --> 00:59:15.438
- Where you going?
- I need a minute.

00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:17.521
We don't have a minute!

00:59:17.605 --> 00:59:19.771
Just leave me alone. Don't you follow me.

00:59:40.105 --> 00:59:42.305
You need to get out
of Monte Carlo right away.

00:59:42.896 --> 00:59:45.136
I got you into this,
I'll help get you out. Come with me.

00:59:45.730 --> 00:59:47.650
- Now! We have to go.
- Right.

00:59:49.896 --> 00:59:52.056
- Lake Como, back roads.
- Yes, sir.

00:59:55.688 --> 00:59:57.848
- Where's Nick?
- I don't know. I don't care.

01:00:26.313 --> 01:00:27.938
<i>Jimmy boy, it's Nick.</i>

01:00:28.021 --> 01:00:29.605
Where are you?

01:00:29.688 --> 01:00:31.480
You guys are all over the news.

01:00:31.563 --> 01:00:32.980
They say you killed three people.

01:00:33.063 --> 01:00:34.271
Do you think that's possible?

01:00:35.021 --> 01:00:36.646
With your aim? Hell, no.

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:39.730
Exactly. Now I'm gonna text you
two international numbers.

01:00:39.813 --> 01:00:42.253
Can you link them together
so I can follow one from the other?

01:00:42.605 --> 01:00:44.396
Are you trying to get my ass fired?

01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.396
But hell, yeah.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:47.313
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:00:47.396 --> 01:00:50.146
There's one more thing
I want you to check into for me.

01:00:54.646 --> 01:00:55.980
What are we doing?

01:00:56.063 --> 01:00:58.605
I just have to dash in
for a quick appointment with my lawyer.

01:00:59.021 --> 01:01:01.247
We're going to read Malcolm's will
at the villa later on,

01:01:01.271 --> 01:01:03.105
and I'm going to get what's mine.

01:01:03.188 --> 01:01:06.355
Charles, that just sounded
very suspicious.

01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:08.271
What about this week doesn't?

01:01:15.646 --> 01:01:16.688
Oh, God.

01:01:21.396 --> 01:01:22.855
Oh, my God. Claritin.

01:01:26.230 --> 01:01:27.855
This is Japanese Claritin.

01:02:16.938 --> 01:02:17.938
Hello?

01:02:20.188 --> 01:02:21.188
Charles?

01:02:27.438 --> 01:02:28.271
Audrey!

01:02:29.271 --> 01:02:30.355
- Ow!
- God!

01:02:30.438 --> 01:02:31.456
- Ow!
- What the...

01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.480
What the...

01:02:33.063 --> 01:02:34.688
What are you doing here?

01:02:34.771 --> 01:02:37.438
I followed Suzi here.

01:02:37.521 --> 01:02:38.938
- Suzi's here?
- Yes.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:42.771
Okay, Cavendish came here to find Suzi.
I'm telling you, Cavendish is in on this.

01:02:42.855 --> 01:02:43.980
I know. I knew that!

01:02:44.063 --> 01:02:46.980
Okay. I just found
a box of Japanese Claritin

01:02:47.063 --> 01:02:49.396
in the back of Cavendish's limo.

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.560
So what? They were planning this
the whole damn time?

01:02:51.605 --> 01:02:53.438
The whole time. This was their plan.

01:02:53.521 --> 01:02:55.521
- So they kill Malcolm, they kill Tobey...
- Yeah.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.688
...before Malcolm has time
to sign the new will.

01:02:57.771 --> 01:02:59.896
- Right.
- That way, Cavendish inherits everything.

01:03:00.188 --> 01:03:01.480
And he splits it with Suzi.

01:03:01.563 --> 01:03:04.063
And if they killed him after,
then Suzi would have inherited.

01:03:04.146 --> 01:03:06.289
- They still would have split that.
- It was a win-win.

01:03:06.313 --> 01:03:07.313
Oh, look at that.

01:03:07.855 --> 01:03:09.271
Who figured that whole thing out?

01:03:09.730 --> 01:03:11.646
The hairdresser. Mm-mm. The hairdresser.

01:03:16.521 --> 01:03:17.771
I got you!

01:03:17.855 --> 01:03:18.855
Jesus! Oh, my God.

01:03:19.146 --> 01:03:20.646
It's just like <i>Death at the Library!</i>

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:22.605
What happens in <i>Death at the Library?</i>

01:03:23.105 --> 01:03:25.480
They died. That's why it's called
<i>Death at the Library.</i>

01:03:29.813 --> 01:03:31.480
Nick, what are you doing?

01:03:31.980 --> 01:03:34.060
We are going to push this over
on the count of three,

01:03:34.105 --> 01:03:35.945
- and then we're gonna run.
- We're gonna what?

01:03:36.105 --> 01:03:37.938
- Don't you trust me?
- No!

01:03:38.605 --> 01:03:40.230
Ready? One!

01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:42.980
Two!

01:03:43.688 --> 01:03:44.938
Three!

01:03:56.605 --> 01:03:57.855
Oh, look! There!

01:04:03.938 --> 01:04:06.438
Oh! Sorry! Oh, my gosh. I am so sorry.

01:04:06.521 --> 01:04:07.521
Come on.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:12.340
- Is that...
- Is that Juan Carlos?

01:04:12.438 --> 01:04:14.355
- Juan Carlos!
- Hey!

01:04:14.646 --> 01:04:15.521
Hello!

01:04:15.605 --> 01:04:16.771
- Juan Carlos!
- How am I?

01:04:16.855 --> 01:04:18.914
- No, no. Suzi! Suzi!
- Suzi! Suzi! Which way is Suzi?

01:04:18.938 --> 01:04:21.313
- Married to Malcolm.
- You two married! Good!

01:04:21.396 --> 01:04:22.396
- No!
- No!

01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:26.313
<i>Suzi vidisti?
Putamus esse illa interfectorem.</i>

01:04:26.771 --> 01:04:28.605
- Yes!
- Latin, baby!

01:04:28.688 --> 01:04:30.456
- Still the international language!
- I got it!

01:04:32.605 --> 01:04:33.646
Shit.

01:04:35.396 --> 01:04:36.605
- Oh!
- Yeah!

01:04:42.313 --> 01:04:43.313
Where'd she go?

01:04:43.938 --> 01:04:44.980
She was right there.

01:04:45.563 --> 01:04:48.105
You should have never come to Lake Como.

01:04:48.396 --> 01:04:50.480
- Wait a minute.
- We know about you and Cavendish.

01:04:50.563 --> 01:04:53.063
- You know nothing.
- We know you're still in love,

01:04:53.146 --> 01:04:55.230
and we know that love is tough
without money.

01:04:55.313 --> 01:04:56.313
Isn't it, Suzi?

01:04:56.438 --> 01:04:58.730
I'll take your word for it.
You're the one whose shoes

01:04:58.813 --> 01:05:00.453
still got a sticker from Marshalls on it.

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.560
- They have name brands now!
- How dare you?

01:05:02.605 --> 01:05:04.247
- They have name brands now!
- How dare you?

01:05:04.271 --> 01:05:06.063
- What?
- These are from Target.

01:05:06.146 --> 01:05:08.480
- How could you not tell me?
- I don't look at your...

01:05:08.563 --> 01:05:10.021
Shut up!

01:05:10.105 --> 01:05:12.605
- Oh!
- Suzi, don't. Please, don't do this.

01:05:12.688 --> 01:05:15.248
No matter what you do,
you're not gonna be safe. I'm telling you.

01:05:15.313 --> 01:05:17.605
One murderer always double-crosses
the other murderer.

01:05:17.688 --> 01:05:20.230
- She reads the books.
- It's just a cliché of the genre!

01:05:20.313 --> 01:05:21.646
I'm telling you!

01:05:24.230 --> 01:05:25.813
Hey! Halloween!

01:05:27.521 --> 01:05:29.021
No, no, no! Oh, my God!

01:05:29.105 --> 01:05:30.105
Go, go, go!

01:05:30.355 --> 01:05:32.480
Cavendish, you move,
I'll blow your head off!

01:05:35.646 --> 01:05:36.813
Shoot <i>at </i>him!

01:05:40.855 --> 01:05:42.813
Oh, babe, you're the worst shot!

01:05:43.063 --> 01:05:45.438
Those were warning shots, honey!

01:05:45.521 --> 01:05:47.646
- Oh, yes! I go fast!
- Go!

01:05:48.730 --> 01:05:51.230
Ambulance! <i>Emergencia!</i>

01:05:54.271 --> 01:05:55.271
Oh!

01:06:00.563 --> 01:06:02.730
Okay, Suzi.
You've gotta tell me who did this.

01:06:02.813 --> 01:06:04.271
Slow down. Don't use your words.

01:06:04.355 --> 01:06:06.480
Let's charade it, okay.
Just tell me with your hand.

01:06:06.938 --> 01:06:08.813
Uh, claw. Bear claw.

01:06:08.896 --> 01:06:10.230
No. Grizzly bear claw.

01:06:10.313 --> 01:06:12.021
Oh! Chewy. Chewy.

01:06:12.105 --> 01:06:13.813
So it's Sergei? No, Sergei's dead.

01:06:14.313 --> 01:06:15.396
Hey!

01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.396
Have you got tires on your feet? Good God!

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:22.188
Spooning. Eating. Uh...

01:06:22.271 --> 01:06:24.188
Ice cream. No, no. Gelato. Gelato?

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:27.230
Oh, God. It's amazing how pretty
you are when you're... I'm sorry.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.313
Hey.

01:06:28.396 --> 01:06:29.855
Hey! Come on!

01:06:32.271 --> 01:06:33.605
Oh, shoot!

01:06:45.813 --> 01:06:46.730
Hey!

01:06:50.188 --> 01:06:51.855
Ba-ba-ba-ba!

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:54.355
Crazy... crazy... Crazy mad love!

01:06:54.605 --> 01:06:56.813
It's crazy 'cause you're madly in love
with Cavendish.

01:06:57.355 --> 01:06:59.355
It's Cavendish, no?
<i>Sleeping With the Ene...</i>

01:06:59.438 --> 01:07:00.480
Sleeping.

01:07:00.563 --> 01:07:01.688
You're not sleeping.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.563
- She's dead now?
- I don't know why this keeps happening!

01:07:04.646 --> 01:07:06.438
<i>Let's go!
We gotta get out of here.</i>

01:07:06.521 --> 01:07:08.361
- <i>Oh, my God. Come on.
- Where?</i>

01:07:09.188 --> 01:07:11.521
Close the airports! Search house to house!

01:07:11.605 --> 01:07:14.438
As God as my witness,
I will find Nick and Audrey Spitz.

01:07:15.188 --> 01:07:16.355
- Inspector?
- Yes?

01:07:16.438 --> 01:07:18.771
I have Nick and Audrey Spitz
on the phone for you.

01:07:18.855 --> 01:07:20.646
- Huh?
- Nick and Audrey Spitz.

01:07:22.896 --> 01:07:23.896
Where are you?

01:07:24.063 --> 01:07:26.688
We are on our way
to Quince's villa right now.

01:07:27.396 --> 01:07:29.563
Oh, okay.

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:32.396
I'm sorry, I wasn't prepared
for you to actually answer that.

01:07:32.813 --> 01:07:34.230
We are being framed right now.

01:07:34.313 --> 01:07:37.271
You meet us at the villa,
we will reveal the killer.

01:07:38.230 --> 01:07:39.230
That kinda rhymed.

01:07:40.188 --> 01:07:41.355
Which is cool, I think.

01:07:52.230 --> 01:07:54.021
- Look at this place.
- Let's go.

01:07:54.105 --> 01:07:55.980
- Oh, my God.
- This is big.

01:07:56.063 --> 01:07:59.813
This is a big house.
This is what they call rich people shit.

01:07:59.896 --> 01:08:01.938
<i>Lord Cavendish is expecting us.</i>

01:08:02.271 --> 01:08:04.021
Second floor, eighth door on the left.

01:08:04.105 --> 01:08:05.985
Yes, that's right.
That's what he told us, yeah.

01:08:06.021 --> 01:08:09.105
Okay, so take a five-spotter.

01:08:09.188 --> 01:08:11.938
Your five euros is how much American-wise?

01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:13.355
Six American dollars.

01:08:13.438 --> 01:08:15.646
Oh, that's, uh... that's more than I...

01:08:15.730 --> 01:08:18.450
- Can I get a half a euro back...
- Oh, God. Please, Nick. Thank you.

01:08:18.521 --> 01:08:20.521
I didn't know they were ahead of us
with the money.

01:08:21.271 --> 01:08:23.396
- Second floor...
- I got no bullets left,

01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.146
so we'll bluff 'em
until Interpol gets here.

01:08:26.230 --> 01:08:27.910
Honey, you just gotta be careful.

01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:30.896
This guy has killed four people,
that we know of.

01:08:31.188 --> 01:08:33.271
Good news is, we know who did it.

01:08:33.355 --> 01:08:35.021
- Okay.
- Hard part is over with.

01:08:35.105 --> 01:08:35.980
Okay.

01:08:36.063 --> 01:08:37.063
And...

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.605
What's up, Dish?

01:08:38.980 --> 01:08:41.355
Stay still!
I'll shoot you right in the six-pack!

01:08:41.438 --> 01:08:43.105
- You hear me, bitch?
- Calm down, babe.

01:08:43.396 --> 01:08:46.188
Make a move! I dare you!

01:08:46.271 --> 01:08:47.188
I dare...

01:08:47.271 --> 01:08:48.271
Oh, my God!

01:08:48.438 --> 01:08:49.855
- He's dead.
- He's dead.

01:08:50.188 --> 01:08:51.521
- Okay, he's dead.
- Oh, my God.

01:08:51.605 --> 01:08:54.105
- What the hell?
- Oh, God. Case reopened, babe.

01:08:54.188 --> 01:08:55.855
They must have poisoned his drink!

01:08:55.938 --> 01:08:58.021
- Nick!
- And look at his face. It's...

01:08:58.105 --> 01:09:01.480
I mean, besides the foaming mouth,
he still kinda looks good.

01:09:01.563 --> 01:09:02.646
What is with this man?

01:09:04.021 --> 01:09:06.622
We told the police. We called the police.
We told 'em to come here.

01:09:06.646 --> 01:09:08.021
- Yes.
- We've got to stop them.

01:09:08.396 --> 01:09:11.813
It's not like canceling a pizza, honey.
You tell 'em to show up, they show up.

01:09:11.896 --> 01:09:13.813
If he's not the killer, who is the killer?

01:09:13.896 --> 01:09:17.146
And if we don't know who the killer is
before they get here, we're screwed!

01:09:17.230 --> 01:09:18.313
Do you understand this?

01:09:18.396 --> 01:09:20.230
He's gotta be here in this house.

01:09:20.313 --> 01:09:23.813
This is gorgeous wallpaper.
Is that fabric? Is this embossed?

01:09:23.896 --> 01:09:27.230
Sweetheart, you're losing it!
You're making me nuts right now!

01:09:27.313 --> 01:09:28.521
No, I know. Hold on. Okay.

01:09:28.605 --> 01:09:30.230
All right, it's good.

01:09:30.313 --> 01:09:31.473
You all right? You breathing?

01:09:31.521 --> 01:09:33.480
- I have to breathe through this.
- Look at me.

01:09:34.271 --> 01:09:36.313
- We gotta turn ourselves in.
- Wait, what?

01:09:36.396 --> 01:09:38.855
They're all gonna show up.
If we run, they're gonna shoot us.

01:09:38.938 --> 01:09:40.813
What do you mean?
We're gonna just go to jail?

01:09:40.896 --> 01:09:42.771
It's better than getting shot, ain't it?

01:09:43.521 --> 01:09:45.521
I don't feel... I don't feel good.

01:09:45.605 --> 01:09:46.938
- Babe.
- Oh, God.

01:09:47.021 --> 01:09:48.313
It's an Italian prison.

01:09:48.396 --> 01:09:50.105
You know the food's gonna be incredible.

01:09:50.188 --> 01:09:52.646
We'll have meatballs
and pesto sauce and all that.

01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:54.563
It's not co-ed, honey. All right?

01:09:54.646 --> 01:09:56.605
We're... We're not gonna be
in jail together.

01:09:56.688 --> 01:09:57.688
I know.

01:09:58.021 --> 01:09:59.230
Why did you lie to me?

01:10:02.563 --> 01:10:03.563
'Cause I was...

01:10:04.063 --> 01:10:06.105
I was, uh... I was embarrassed.

01:10:06.396 --> 01:10:07.438
With me?

01:10:08.146 --> 01:10:09.605
Why? I...

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:12.980
I could've helped you figure that out.
That's why we're together.

01:10:13.063 --> 01:10:14.063
I know.

01:10:14.188 --> 01:10:16.730
Remember when I couldn't pay
my rent at the salon,

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:21.063
and then you were like, "Oh, okay."
You got that boot off my landlord's car.

01:10:21.355 --> 01:10:23.480
- That got me another week.
- Yeah, I remember.

01:10:23.563 --> 01:10:25.603
Remember when your cholesterol
was through the roof?

01:10:25.855 --> 01:10:28.563
And then I made you eat egg whites?
You hate egg whites.

01:10:28.646 --> 01:10:30.438
And I made you do it,
and I did it with you.

01:10:30.521 --> 01:10:33.105
You helped me not miss yolks anymore.

01:10:33.188 --> 01:10:35.331
That's right. That's what we do.
We do things together.

01:10:35.355 --> 01:10:38.730
So can we please
just figure this out, too?

01:10:38.813 --> 01:10:40.605
We just don't know who did it.

01:10:40.688 --> 01:10:42.896
But Nick, we know who didn't do it.

01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:44.271
- All right?
- Right.

01:10:44.355 --> 01:10:48.396
So let's just go downstairs
and act like we figured it out.

01:10:48.896 --> 01:10:51.813
If we're gonna do that, we gotta...
we just gotta look confident.

01:10:51.896 --> 01:10:54.730
All right. If we're gonna look confident,
we've gotta dress it.

01:10:54.813 --> 01:10:56.646
I already know what I wanna wear.

01:10:57.021 --> 01:10:58.021
What?

01:11:11.730 --> 01:11:12.980
What's up, fools?

01:11:13.063 --> 01:11:15.355
Okay, we solved the case. Boom.

01:11:15.438 --> 01:11:18.563
Yo, yo! Where'd you get the clothes?
It's a little much.

01:11:19.063 --> 01:11:19.938
Um...

01:11:20.021 --> 01:11:23.146
I found this beautiful dress
in a random closet.

01:11:23.230 --> 01:11:25.605
- You're looking gorgeous, by the way.
- Thanks, baby.

01:11:25.688 --> 01:11:28.313
- And he got this stunning tux...
- Mm-hmm.

01:11:28.688 --> 01:11:29.688
...off a...

01:11:30.230 --> 01:11:31.605
Oh, why candy-coat it?

01:11:31.688 --> 01:11:32.813
- A corpse.
- Yeah.

01:11:32.896 --> 01:11:34.188
There's another corpse?

01:11:34.271 --> 01:11:35.646
Jeez! Sorry, yes.

01:11:35.730 --> 01:11:37.396
Upstairs, eighth door on the left.

01:11:38.396 --> 01:11:40.855
To whom does this dead corpse belong?

01:11:40.938 --> 01:11:42.271
Oh, yeah. You guys don't know.

01:11:42.355 --> 01:11:43.622
- Bad news, guys.
- It's terrible.

01:11:43.646 --> 01:11:44.563
Cavendish is dead.

01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:48.563
You stole the tux off Charlie's dead body?

01:11:48.646 --> 01:11:51.164
And it fits perfectly.
Little tight in the crotch, to be honest.

01:11:51.188 --> 01:11:53.247
Just kidding. No, he's got me beat.
He's got me beat.

01:11:53.271 --> 01:11:54.938
Wait. Where's Suzi?

01:11:55.313 --> 01:11:56.688
- She's dead.
- Dead.

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:57.771
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

01:11:57.855 --> 01:12:00.563
Y'all are like the miniature
Manson Family!

01:12:00.646 --> 01:12:02.122
- No, no, no.
- Nick and Audrey Spitz,

01:12:02.146 --> 01:12:03.813
- you are under arrest.
- Listen.

01:12:03.896 --> 01:12:05.521
<i>Ferme la bouche.</i> Is that what it is?

01:12:05.605 --> 01:12:08.271
- Just give us a second. We got this.
- We got this. Let's go.

01:12:08.355 --> 01:12:09.355
Thank you.

01:12:10.521 --> 01:12:14.230
All right. Ladies and gentlemen,
let's review the facts.

01:12:14.313 --> 01:12:15.188
Malcolm Quince,

01:12:15.271 --> 01:12:17.146
he was the first to get murdered.

01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:18.855
We all assumed it was Tobey.

01:12:18.938 --> 01:12:21.146
- No, we all assumed you did it.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:21.230 --> 01:12:23.855
- Okay.
- Yeah, but Tobey hated his father,

01:12:23.938 --> 01:12:26.896
and he stood to inherit
billions of dollars.

01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:29.521
- Until he caught some lead to the dome.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12:29.605 --> 01:12:31.730
- Can you feel me, Raja?
- Pew-pew-pew!

01:12:32.021 --> 01:12:33.146
- There it is.
- And then,

01:12:33.230 --> 01:12:36.355
before Sergei was shot,
he told us that the Colonel did it.

01:12:36.438 --> 01:12:37.438
He told you what?

01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:40.771
But we know you didn't do it, Colonel,
because we saw you flossing your teeth

01:12:40.855 --> 01:12:42.813
when we were shimmying
by your window that night.

01:12:43.105 --> 01:12:45.855
You two were spying on me in my bathroom?

01:12:45.938 --> 01:12:49.605
Trust me, I did... We saw a lot of shit
that night that I did not want to see.

01:12:49.688 --> 01:12:53.271
I mean, apologize ahead of time.
We had to see you guys having sex.

01:12:53.563 --> 01:12:54.646
You, um...

01:12:54.730 --> 01:12:56.480
You... saw that?

01:12:56.563 --> 01:12:58.230
Maharajah, some advice for you.

01:12:58.313 --> 01:13:00.313
Maybe grab the bottom and squeeze.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.896
Huh. Word.

01:13:03.438 --> 01:13:04.271
Anyway...

01:13:04.355 --> 01:13:05.563
French fries. Yes.

01:13:05.646 --> 01:13:08.063
Actually, Juan Carlos,
you had nothing to do with this.

01:13:08.146 --> 01:13:09.866
You couldn't have had anything
to do with it

01:13:09.938 --> 01:13:12.605
because you were with us
when Suzi got killed.

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:14.408
- So it wasn't you.
- Mm-mm.

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:15.855
- It wasn't you.
- Mm-mm.

01:13:15.938 --> 01:13:17.688
- It wasn't you.
- No.

01:13:17.771 --> 01:13:18.896
It wasn't you.

01:13:19.271 --> 01:13:20.813
Holy shit! Maybe we did do it.

01:13:20.896 --> 01:13:22.355
- What?
- Did you?

01:13:22.438 --> 01:13:24.398
- Because listen...
- What did you just say to me?

01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:26.730
- I'm just messing around.
- There it is.

01:13:26.813 --> 01:13:28.813
- And he's clapping.
- Going to jail. Thanks, babe.

01:13:28.855 --> 01:13:31.813
I'm glad we finally
are all on the same page.

01:13:32.105 --> 01:13:35.688
Now, since the first murder occurred
in French territorial waters,

01:13:35.771 --> 01:13:39.188
I will be taking you to Paris
to be arraigned and tried.

01:13:39.271 --> 01:13:41.414
At least we're going to Paris.
You always wanted to go.

01:13:41.438 --> 01:13:44.271
Honey, if you keep making jokes
at a time like this,

01:13:44.355 --> 01:13:45.855
it's not gonna make this go away.

01:13:45.938 --> 01:13:49.188
Lucky for you, since 1977,

01:13:49.271 --> 01:13:51.980
there has been no death penalty
under French law.

01:13:52.355 --> 01:13:53.771
French law.

01:13:53.855 --> 01:13:54.771
French law.

01:13:54.855 --> 01:13:56.355
The French law. Yeah.

01:13:56.438 --> 01:13:59.021
Surely, Inspector, you of all people

01:13:59.105 --> 01:14:01.896
are familiar
with the French inheritance law.

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:04.230
Are you implying I have bastard children?

01:14:04.855 --> 01:14:05.771
Well, I wasn't.

01:14:05.855 --> 01:14:06.938
Because I do.

01:14:07.021 --> 01:14:08.855
I was surprised you knew about them.

01:14:09.146 --> 01:14:10.771
I love those little bastards.

01:14:11.105 --> 01:14:15.230
Okay. Anyway, um,
the French law states that a man's estate

01:14:15.313 --> 01:14:18.230
must be divided equally
amongst his children.

01:14:18.521 --> 01:14:20.855
So it wouldn't matter what the will said.

01:14:20.938 --> 01:14:22.563
Straight up, Maharajah.

01:14:22.646 --> 01:14:26.730
The kids were gonna get the money,
whether the old man married Suzi or not.

01:14:26.813 --> 01:14:29.771
Mm-hmm.
But both of Malcolm's children are dead.

01:14:30.063 --> 01:14:31.605
- Both?
- Yes. Tobey,

01:14:31.688 --> 01:14:34.813
and the son he had
with Madeleine LeBoutillier..

01:14:34.896 --> 01:14:36.813
That boy died at childbirth.

01:14:37.105 --> 01:14:38.105
Did he, Colonel?

01:14:38.521 --> 01:14:40.521
I spoke to my partner in New York City.

01:14:40.605 --> 01:14:44.063
I said, get the death certificates
for Madeleine and the son.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:45.980
He could only find one for Madeleine.

01:14:46.063 --> 01:14:48.539
But then I started thinking,
maybe there's no death certificate

01:14:48.563 --> 01:14:50.146
because there was no death.

01:14:50.230 --> 01:14:54.896
Nonsense. Malcolm desperately wanted a boy
to sire the next generation of Quinces.

01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.605
He would never abandon a son.

01:14:56.688 --> 01:14:57.688
But...

01:14:58.521 --> 01:14:59.563
what if it was a daughter?

01:14:59.646 --> 01:15:00.872
- Yes!
- What if it was a daughter?

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.271
The love of his life dies,

01:15:02.355 --> 01:15:04.938
dies giving birth
to his unwanted daughter.

01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:07.605
- Yes!
- It almost makes sense.

01:15:07.688 --> 01:15:09.896
- It does! It kinda does!
- It makes total sense.

01:15:09.980 --> 01:15:11.563
He gave her away.

01:15:11.646 --> 01:15:12.771
Then where is she now?

01:15:12.855 --> 01:15:15.521
Well, she could be anywhere.
She could have got married.

01:15:15.605 --> 01:15:18.396
She could've joined a gang,
changed her name. Who knows? Carry on.

01:15:18.688 --> 01:15:20.230
- Changed her name.
- Ah!

01:15:20.313 --> 01:15:22.855
- You changed your name.
- Yes.

01:15:22.938 --> 01:15:24.646
Your real last name isn't Ballard.

01:15:24.938 --> 01:15:25.938
So?

01:15:26.146 --> 01:15:28.146
Lots of artists change their names.

01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:30.146
Lady Gaga's real name isn't Lady Gaga.

01:15:30.230 --> 01:15:32.438
Yes, Lady Gaga. "Paparazzi," yes, good.

01:15:32.521 --> 01:15:35.896
But every Grace Ballard superfan knows

01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:38.105
your first movie was <i>Summer Wetdown.</i>

01:15:38.188 --> 01:15:41.438
You had three lines,
and you went by your birth name,

01:15:41.521 --> 01:15:43.021
Grace Butler.

01:15:43.396 --> 01:15:46.355
Which, <i>en français,</i>
roughly translates to LeBoutillier.

01:15:46.438 --> 01:15:48.938
Madeleine LeBoutillier, your mother.

01:15:49.021 --> 01:15:49.938
This is a joke.

01:15:50.021 --> 01:15:52.355
I wasn't even in the room
when Malcolm Quince was murdered.

01:15:52.438 --> 01:15:55.521
Fine! Then Tobey killed him,
but he did it with a little help.

01:15:55.605 --> 01:15:57.730
<i>The lights. You turned out the lights.</i>

01:15:58.438 --> 01:16:01.813
<i>You convinced Tobey to kill Malcolm
so you could split the money with him.</i>

01:16:03.938 --> 01:16:06.938
<i>And then you killed Tobey
so that you could just keep all of it.</i>

01:16:07.021 --> 01:16:09.855
Then me and this girl
started asking too many questions.

01:16:09.938 --> 01:16:11.271
So you had to get rid of us.

01:16:14.938 --> 01:16:17.688
<i>Luckily, not for him,
but Sergei gets in the way.</i>

01:16:18.813 --> 01:16:20.563
<i>Then you seduce the Maharajah</i>

01:16:20.646 --> 01:16:23.438
<i>so that you would make us think
you were with him all night.</i>

01:16:23.521 --> 01:16:26.855
Yo, you were just twizzlin'
on my wizzle for an alibi.

01:16:26.938 --> 01:16:28.021
Girl, that's cold.

01:16:28.105 --> 01:16:30.230
You tried to kill us in the library.

01:16:30.813 --> 01:16:33.563
<i>You tried to kill us in the market,
but you got Suzi instead.</i>

01:16:35.105 --> 01:16:36.563
- And the weapon...
- Hm!

01:16:36.646 --> 01:16:38.813
- I recognize the weapon now.
- The dart?

01:16:38.896 --> 01:16:41.664
It was a movie. I watched it one night.
You were out with your friends.

01:16:41.688 --> 01:16:43.396
You came back drunk and, uh...

01:16:43.480 --> 01:16:44.646
What the hell was it?

01:16:45.230 --> 01:16:46.355
<i>Princess Blow Dart.</i>

01:16:46.438 --> 01:16:47.438
Oh, God.

01:16:47.480 --> 01:16:48.855
That is not the name of a movie.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:49.980
It is! It is!

01:16:50.063 --> 01:16:51.730
Yo, look at my screensaver.

01:16:52.021 --> 01:16:53.771
- That's her!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:16:53.855 --> 01:16:55.938
So then you killed Charles

01:16:56.021 --> 01:16:59.855
<i>because you knew he would never rest
until he found out who Suzi's killer was.</i>

01:17:00.438 --> 01:17:02.771
<i>'Cause he loved Suzi, not you!</i>

01:17:02.855 --> 01:17:04.146
<i>The three motives:</i>

01:17:04.230 --> 01:17:05.771
money, love, revenge.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.105
You were the mastermind

01:17:07.188 --> 01:17:09.396
behind Malcolm Quince's murders,
weren't you?

01:17:09.480 --> 01:17:12.521
- And you were the one who framed us.
- You killed them all, didn't you?

01:17:12.605 --> 01:17:13.646
Didn't you?

01:17:14.313 --> 01:17:15.938
My father was a monster.

01:17:18.105 --> 01:17:19.105
So you admit it?

01:17:19.521 --> 01:17:20.521
Yes.

01:17:21.105 --> 01:17:24.105
I am the daughter of Malcolm Quince
and Madeleine LeBoutillier,

01:17:24.730 --> 01:17:27.771
and sole heir to the Quince fortune.

01:17:28.021 --> 01:17:30.480
Uh, and... what about the murders?

01:17:31.855 --> 01:17:33.396
Oh, I didn't do those.

01:17:33.855 --> 01:17:36.688
But it couldn't have happened
to a nicer group of people.

01:17:38.021 --> 01:17:39.021
So...

01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:40.813
what other proof do you have?

01:17:40.896 --> 01:17:42.521
- Of what?
- Proof of what?

01:17:42.605 --> 01:17:44.146
That she killed everybody?

01:17:44.605 --> 01:17:45.438
Yes.

01:17:45.521 --> 01:17:47.230
Aren't you gonna do anything at all?

01:17:47.688 --> 01:17:49.771
I mean, is there a French holiday
we're unaware of?

01:17:49.855 --> 01:17:51.105
What the hell do you do?

01:17:51.313 --> 01:17:52.313
Look...

01:17:52.855 --> 01:17:55.146
I don't know
how you do things in Brooklyn,

01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:57.813
but here we need evidence
to make an arrest.

01:17:57.896 --> 01:17:59.605
This is not
how this is supposed to happen.

01:17:59.688 --> 01:18:03.355
The detective is supposed to explain
the murders, which we just did,

01:18:03.438 --> 01:18:08.230
and then the killer is supposed to crack
and freak out under pressure and admit it!

01:18:08.771 --> 01:18:09.938
If there's nothing else,

01:18:10.021 --> 01:18:12.230
I'd like to start spending my money now.

01:18:17.146 --> 01:18:19.521
The hat. The hat! Uh, take off your hat.

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:21.980
What?

01:18:22.521 --> 01:18:24.355
I said take off your hat.

01:18:26.105 --> 01:18:27.105
No.

01:18:27.396 --> 01:18:30.271
The Maharajah bought me this hat,
and I quite like it.

01:18:30.355 --> 01:18:32.771
Nick hit the killer in the head
with a plate.

01:18:33.521 --> 01:18:35.396
And it left a mark, didn't it?

01:18:36.021 --> 01:18:36.896
Also,

01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:41.563
why on earth would you put a hat
on a freshly styled head of hair?

01:18:41.646 --> 01:18:44.146
How would you know
my hair's been freshly styled?

01:18:44.230 --> 01:18:46.605
'Cause she's a goddamn hairdresser.

01:18:47.646 --> 01:18:49.396
Please remove your hat, Ms. Butler.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:51.605
I'll do nothing of the kind.

01:18:55.730 --> 01:18:58.646
The butler did it. Grace Butler did it!
Grace But... Right?

01:18:58.730 --> 01:19:01.146
- I said it on the plane.
- You had to do it!

01:19:01.230 --> 01:19:02.480
- Stay back!
- Jesus!

01:19:02.855 --> 01:19:03.855
Everybody!

01:19:06.605 --> 01:19:08.480
- Oh, my God!
- Son of a bitch.

01:19:09.230 --> 01:19:10.313
- Wait! No, no.
- Whoa!

01:19:10.396 --> 01:19:11.563
Nobody move!

01:19:11.646 --> 01:19:13.105
Nobody move, or I'll shoot her.

01:19:13.188 --> 01:19:14.771
Guns down. <i>Baissez vos armes.</i>

01:19:22.938 --> 01:19:24.098
Get an ambulance.

01:19:24.563 --> 01:19:26.730
Yo, I thought you said
he was a terrible shot.

01:19:26.813 --> 01:19:28.980
Not when it comes to saving my woman.

01:19:29.063 --> 01:19:31.771
I was aiming for her foot, by the way.

01:19:32.355 --> 01:19:33.980
All right. It's all right.

01:19:37.938 --> 01:19:40.646
Thank you for stepping in
and trying to stop her, Juan Carlos.

01:19:40.730 --> 01:19:41.896
That was so brave.

01:19:42.230 --> 01:19:43.271
<i>De nada, señora.</i>

01:19:46.313 --> 01:19:49.271
I love that. I love that he's brave
and I'm, what, nothing?

01:19:49.355 --> 01:19:52.105
- Are you kidding? I said you were brave.
<i>- </i>You didn't say it.

01:19:52.188 --> 01:19:54.730
I said so many times.
"Nick, you were so brave."

01:19:54.813 --> 01:19:57.355
<i>De nada, señora. </i>Halloween.

01:19:58.355 --> 01:19:59.438
Yo, I got a question.

01:20:00.105 --> 01:20:01.855
In the hotel in Monte Carlo,

01:20:01.938 --> 01:20:03.855
you said that you saw
me and Grace together.

01:20:04.146 --> 01:20:05.480
- We heard you.
- We heard you.

01:20:05.563 --> 01:20:07.438
We didn't like what we heard,
but I'll tell...

01:20:07.521 --> 01:20:09.730
- I'm sorry.
- I hope those are new pants, by the way.

01:20:09.813 --> 01:20:11.563
Yeah, but...

01:20:12.396 --> 01:20:13.438
But the truth is,

01:20:13.521 --> 01:20:15.771
Grace and I were together in the bar

01:20:15.855 --> 01:20:17.855
an hour before we got to our room,

01:20:17.938 --> 01:20:20.396
so how could she have killed Sergei

01:20:20.938 --> 01:20:22.063
if she was with me?

01:20:24.688 --> 01:20:25.563
Nick.

01:20:25.646 --> 01:20:26.646
Audrey.

01:20:27.105 --> 01:20:29.563
How did Juan Carlos understand
my English just now?

01:20:47.771 --> 01:20:48.896
Stop!

01:20:55.771 --> 01:20:57.105
No! No!

01:20:57.855 --> 01:20:59.313
Don't come any closer!

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:01.230
Aah! He speaks English!

01:21:01.313 --> 01:21:03.146
I've spoken English my whole life,
you idiots,

01:21:03.230 --> 01:21:04.813
and a dozen other languages.

01:21:05.105 --> 01:21:06.938
And by the way, your Latin sucks.

01:21:07.021 --> 01:21:08.396
