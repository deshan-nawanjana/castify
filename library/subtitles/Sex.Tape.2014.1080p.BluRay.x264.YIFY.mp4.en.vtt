00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.529
We're gonna be late. WOMAN:
Wake up, sleepyhead!

WOMAN 2: Annie!
Shit.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.330
Hey, guys.
I, uh, totally overslept.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.281
Um, okay. Well, you can meet us.
ANNIE: Okay. That sounds...

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.361

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.286
(GRUNTS)

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.644
I saw your butt.
Just standin' there.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:53.881
Did you?

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.883
I never seen
your butt before.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.530
I had no choice.

ANNIE: <i>We accidentally
left the door open.</i>

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.643

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.722
<i>where you accidentally

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.890
I love fucking you.

I fucking love you.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.411
ANNIE: For Jay and I,

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.720
<i>the next few months
were a blur</i>

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.249

(ANNIE AND JAY GRUNTING)

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.287
Okay. I got it.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.925
(GRUNTS) on, God!

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.885
I'll probably be pretty
hungry after this.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.320
It's been a while
since I've eaten.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.805
I can make you
a sandwich.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.644
We could probably make a burrito
out of shit we have here.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.721
Okay-

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.810
(SQUEALING)
Oh, no!

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.008
Holy Mary,

ANNIE: <i>And let's face it.
(SIGHS)</i>

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.800
<i>The erections.</i>

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.882
<i>Oh, God. Do you remember
the erections?</i>

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.962
<i>Erections everywhere.</i>

<i>If the Wind blew.</i>

<i>If he woke up.</i>

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.201
Good morning.

Annie?

<i>Everywhere we went,
everything we did,</i>

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.761
<i>was another opportunity
to have sex.</i>

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.208
Do you think we should be
doing this right here?

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.800
Baby, honestly,
I don't think anyone

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.291
can tell what's happening.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.964
ANNIE: <i>It's not that
it was just sex.</i>

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.610
<i>But we knew that
there was always</i>

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.489

the corner.</i>

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.322
Jay and I
have some big news.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.520
We're in love. We're pregnant
and we're getting married.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.571
Come again?
Honey, wait. What?

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.367
(STAMMERS)
Are you sure?

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.601
Yeah. I took the test
three times.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.680
No, honey. No, I mean,

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.370
are you sure that now
is the right time?

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.168
You're both very,
very young

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.129
and who knows what
the future holds?

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.130
(CLEARS THROAT)
Uh, Greg?

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.046
Oh. Jay.

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.845
Yeah. Where are you
from again?

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.290
Mr. and Mrs. Grovner, uh,

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.044
I know that we just met.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.761
But when I first met Annie,

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.285
I knew that she was the one.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.761
And so I think,
once you get to know me,

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:34.841
you're gonna feel

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.203
a lot better about this
moment than you do right now

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.610
because I really love
your daughter.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.727
(MOUTHING) I love you.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.324
Oh, boy.
(CHUCKLES)

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.330
Well, goodbye, sex.
(CHUCKLES)

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.726
Dad!
Walt.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.609
What?
What?

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.640
They're not right,
are they?

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.563
No, of course not.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.085
I don't think.

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.401
We're not too young?

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.323
JAY: Oh, we're young.
You know?

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.562
But we definitely
know each other.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.726
Greg, right?

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.405
Yes, I'm Greg.

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.600
Look, here's what I think.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.721
They're right.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.167
We don't know
what the future holds.

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.089
But I also think that whatever
the world throws at us,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.923
let's deal with it, right?

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.041
Yeah.
You know?

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.804
But what about
the sex part?

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.008
Are you still gonna
wanna have sex with me

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.128
even when I am big
and fat and pregnant,

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.009
and then later when
I'm somebody's mother?

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.206
Yeah!

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.645
Yeah.
Really?

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.846
Babe, my dick
can see the future.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.206
That's why we call it
Nostracockus.

(LAUGHS)

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.369
What about you? Are you gonna
wanna have sex with me?

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.960
Yes, I'm gonna wanna
have sex with you.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.001
Yeah?
Yes!

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.040
Do you know why I'm gonna
wanna have sex with you?

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.761
My butt?
Because of your butt, babe.

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.446
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:53.762
ANNIE: <i>We promised ourselves
nothing would change.</i>

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.285
<i>That we wouldn't let it.</i>

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.204
<i>And even though
it was awkward sometimes,</i>

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.770
<i>we made it work.</i>

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:59.966
If you could just turn
a little bit more

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.161
Yep.
To the right.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.730
I think we're good.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.567
That's... I'm maxed out.
My stomach's in the way.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.846
You know what?
I'm gonna grab boob.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.046
Yeah, just be careful.
They're really sensitive.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.281
And not in a good way.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.407
Got it. Very gently
grabbin' boob.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480
Okay, gently.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.046
And here comes the penis.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.327

And often, successful.</i>

You're doing great!

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.486
Yeah.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.320
Wow!

That is one
incredibly versatile hole.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.850
You're tellin' me.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.651

everything was completely different.</i>

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:47.921

made it difficult,</i>

almost impossible.</i>

I need a little help here.

I may be late for my thing

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.680

Can we switch places?

Uh, one minute.
This is really important.

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.120
What are you workin' on?

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.770
It's my video

impressive, man.

Where'd you learn how to do that?
It's really easy, Dad.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.040
Hey, save it as something

other than "Video 1"
for me, will ya?

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.529
It's fine. It's Video 1.

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.284
Hey, Clive. I asked you
to do something, right?

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:10.640
Don't condescend to me.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.800

Am I gonna sell the blog for money?
Like, real money?

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.561
Is that possible?

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.040
It would be amazing.
For everything.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.809
CLIVE: Dad,
I can't be late again!

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:52.882
Yes! I'll be right there, guys!
CLIVE: Let's go!

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.803
Yes, Clive! I heard...

00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.451
Is it just me or is the big
one becoming kind of a dick?

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.171
Don't say that.
Seriously, babe.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.368
No, I'm just sayin'
he's acting like a dick.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.566
Don't say that.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.564
Hey, we should have
sex sometime soon.

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.569
Oh, I would love that.
Yeah, me, too.

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800
Maybe Thursday.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.842
Fantastic. 'Cause it feels
like it's been a long time.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:12.126
It has, right?
JAY: Yeah.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.961
The last time was when we got those
towels from Bed Bath & Beyond.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.809
Oh, that's right. That was a while ago.
Yeah, the linen sale.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.480
Look, we can't talk
about this right now,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.726
because we both
have someplace to be.

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.200
Not the right time.
Gotta get goin'.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.890
It's just been so hard to find
the moment with the kids.

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.769
At the end of the day, we're
just both so exhausted.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.240
You know? Oh, just
tell me about it.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:27.770
Maybe one of these nights,
we'll have sex

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:29.365
<i>instead of watching
Project Runway.</i>

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.005
We'll TiVo <i>Project Runway.</i>

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.605
That's probably why
they invented TiVo.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.011
So people could have sex.

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.120
NELL: Daddy?
I still don't get it.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:40.931
Why do we keep having
all of these days?

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.321
And then,
going to bed at night?

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.085
And then, having
all of these days?

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.322
And then, going to bed
at night?

00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:51.844
Well, uh, that's
sort of what life is.

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.969
When will it end?

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:56.281
It won't.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.606
Well, it'll end
when we die.

00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.806
Don't do that, buddy.
Okay?

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.368
Won't I get bored
of doing this stuff

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.920
again and again and again?

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.121
No.

00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.690
But you and Mommy
are bored.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.202
Well, that's what
happens with marriage.

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.281
Who are you?

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.601
(CHUCKLES)

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:17.291
Dad, (STUTTERS)
Nell's doing it again.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:20.728
Hey. Nell, get your finger
out of your butt.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.203
Is anyone gonna
clean her finger?

00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.290
Hey! Stop! No!

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:27.600
Nell!
CLIVE: No. stop.

00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:28.847
Do you mind if I join you?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.921
I don't mind!

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.729
CLIVE: No! Stop. Stop!
(LAUGHTER)

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.567
As you know, Piper Brothers
is the world's number one

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.404
toy and child
product brand

00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.970
in the zero-to-four
age range

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.644
for over 50 years.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.961
We're looking to bring Piper
Brothers into the future.

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.769
And a big part of
that is developing

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.604
the Piper Brothers
online community

00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:48.081
in a way that's befitting
of the Piper Brothers name.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:49.571
But also in a way that says,

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:51.520
"This is not your grandfather's
Piper Brothers."

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:54.082
But in order for us
to do that, we need content.

00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:56.242
Hey, everybody! Annie!

00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.646
Hi.
Hank Rosenbaum.

00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:59.762
Such a pleasure.
Thank you so much.

00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:01.683
I've heard so much
about you.

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.171
Please, sit down.
Thank you.

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:05.004
Can I get you anything?
Coffee? Finger sandwich?

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.804
Sliced pineapple?

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.282
No, no. I'm fine with just water.
Thanks.

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.491
Oh, well, I just wanna stick
my head in and say hi

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.562
and to tell you that I'm a
big fan of what you do.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.688
Thanks. That's really
nice to hear.

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.091
We think you have
brand potential.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.565
The model
Piper Brothers mother.

00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.840
HANK: We really
believe in you.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.365
And I always say
that belief

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.680
is the only metric
that matters.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.205
We didn't bring you here to wow
you with incredible numbers

00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.044
because numbers
are really just

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:31.600
an algorithm for
passion and values.

00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:33.648
It's like I was
telling my wife, Schlomit,

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.247
I think I found the voice
of Piper Brothers' values.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.408
(CHUCKLES) Yeesh!

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:41.881
Thanks!

00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:43.166
Are you sure
we can't get you

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.890
a finger sandwich
or a slice of pineapple?

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:48.800
I'm okay.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.804
There are certain content
guidelines we'd like to discuss.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.804
Oh, how do you mean?
Little things.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.484
"Do you remember
the first time

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:57.085
"your husband
saw you naked?"

00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.207
Right, um...

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.005
"The erections? Do you
remember the erections?"

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.571
(CHUCKLES)
No, I remember that part.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.801
"Erections everywhere."

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.570
That's an unusual
post for me.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.563
It's a great post.
I enjoyed it.

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:09.608
But what we're looking
for from you

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:12.803
is your authentic,
wholesome voice.

00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.211
It's the kind of content
that Piper Brothers

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.486
mothers are so hungry for.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.722
Look, I love
being a mother.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.524
And I love writing
about it.

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.368
Well, we will make you
a meaningful proposal.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:23.771
And we're very excited.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.326
Should we have
some pineapple?

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:27.641
(LAUGHING)

00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:30.687
We can have someone
get you some pineapple.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:33.207
MAN: <i>Band's coming to the
Los Angeles area tomorrow.</i>

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.965
<i>Meantime, here's the new single.
It's called Spank Me.</i>

00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.128
I swear to you, man.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.964
I think I am in love
with this girl.

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.605
Max, that's big news.
Yeah.

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:43.091
It's, like, we...

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.889
I don't know.
We just connect.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.530
Like, we have these
really long, like,

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:49.444
super intense
conversations. You know?

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:52.683
About religion,
and snowboarding.

00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.247
And then, like,
out of nowhere,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:57.721
she'll just text me
her boobs.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.360
She just texted you a picture
of her boobs out of the blue?

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.324
Oh, buddy. Good for you.
(CHUCKLES)

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.608
Enjoy this time.
Thank you, dude.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.846
That's amazing.
Yeah.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.763
I once sent Annie
a picture of my dick.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.411
She was at a PTA meeting.
It was horrible.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Did you go full dick?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.166
Yeah. I...

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.361
Oh.

00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.000
For a man, I feel like
it's dick or...

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.485
That's kind of
your only option.

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.641
Yeah, I avoid my dick.

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.449
I usually just do, like,

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.885
you know, the sexier
parts of me.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.843
Um, like, part bag,
part leg.

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:26.967
You know?

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:28.849
I'll go undercarriage.
So...

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.166
I'll have my friend,
Doug, come over

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:31.571
and we'll just
knock it out real fast.

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.484
Your friend comes over and
takes a picture of your balls?

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:36.085
Yeah. Yeah.
You know Doug, right?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.690
Your neighbor?
Yeah.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.489
He's actually a really
good photographer.

00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:40.607
He works from home.

00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.681
And, so...
ROSIE: Hey, guys.

00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:43.250
Hey, Rosie.
Hello, Rosie.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.407
New iPads are here.

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:46.767
Ah, thank you. I have
been waiting for these.

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.921
How many of those
things do you have?

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.001
Two at a time.

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.003
One for new music.
One for back catalogue.

00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.731
I have this complicated syncing
system, but it works out.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.002
Well, what do you do with the old ones?
I just give 'em as gifts.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.081
(PHONE BUZZES)

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.048
Hey, babe. How'd it go?
They wanna buy it!

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.566
That's amazing! What did they say?
Did they make an offer?

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.687
They're going to.

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:07.001
They said it would be "meaningful."
Whatever that means.

00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.208
I think that means
a lot of money.

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.725
<i>Right?</i>
(SQUEALS) <i>I</i> know!

00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.086
Well, we have to celebrate.

00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.840
Slow down. They haven't
made the offer yet.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.048
They're going to. And
that's reason to celebrate.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.849
I can get Sam to cover me tonight.
What do you wanna do?

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.042
I don't know. Should we take
the kids somewhere fun?

00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.800
Like pizza and roller
skating or something?

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:24.811
Totally! I can't wait.

00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.450
I'll see you
in a couple hours.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.762

No, it's great.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.127
They're sleepin' over.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.201
Yes!

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:42.604
'Cause I was thinking that...
Whoa.

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:47.209
Maybe we could celebrate,
just the two of us.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.681
I get it.

00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.484
That's a great idea.

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.961
This is, like, the best
idea you've ever had.

00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:54.724
(CHUCKLES)
You look amazing.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.803
Do you own these underwear?
Mm-hmm.

00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:58.450
'Cause I've never
seen those before.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.560
Come on.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.002
This is so exciting.
I'm so excited right now.

And now you're
on the bed.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.722
This is great.
I love where this is headed.

00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:13.849
Your narrating,
it's so hot.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.570
She said, encouragingly.

00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.730
Get over here and take these
roller skates off of me.

00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.161
I love it when you talk that
way about your roller skates.

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:25.881
Double knot.

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.920
Okay-

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.240
Here, maybe...

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.645
No, no, no, I got it.
Okay.

00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:49.442
ANNIE: (GIGGLING) Ooh.

00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:51.848
Okay, that should do it.

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.528

Uh-huh.

Fuck! Ow.
Ow!

00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.971

real quick, didn't it?

Mm-hmm?
Mm-hmm.

00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.088
Mm-hmm.
Should we continue?

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.400
Yes.
Mm.

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.041

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.724
Babe. That was like...
Toothy.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.848
Okay, just relax.
Do I not seem relaxed?

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.445
No, I mean both of us.
What I'm talking about.

00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:33.721
Oh. We'll both relax.
We'll just relax.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.926
If we both relaxed,
it'd be good.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.331
Just...

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.330
Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.408
What is happening with us right now?
I don't know.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.891
I just got
in my head a little bit.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.729
It was just weird for a second.
I'm sorry. Okay, it's fine.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.325
Here's what we're gonna do.

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:00.765
All right.
Here we go.

00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:02.490
Let's do this thing.
It's on.

00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:03.841

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:07.841
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:09.921
Oh.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.843
What?
We have hit boob.

00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:14.162
(ANNIE LAUGHS) We've got
a man on second base.

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:16.523
It's a baseball term but it
also means touching your boob.

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.762
I know what it means.
Why don't we go to third.

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.521
Whoa.

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.207

Hmm?

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:30.681
What?

00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:32.690
Too much in my own head.

00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:33.880
I think I've been
dreaming

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.086
about this moment
for so long Mm-hmm.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.362
When we could, like,
drop everything Yeah.

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.006
And just properly schtup.
Right, right.

00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.162
Instead of when
you're like, half conscious

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.685
and can't resist,
you know?

00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.125
You think I wanna resist?

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:47.123
Of course I know
that you wanna have sex.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.283
Sometimes I just wonder if you
wanna have sex that much.

00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:53.045
I do. I do wanna
have sex that much.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.884
But sometimes
I just feel like

00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:56.962
you know, you're tired
or you're stressed out.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.041
And maybe...
Me?

00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.121
I don't know,
I wonder sometimes

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.810
if you're still, you know,
attracted to me.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:03.167
Are you kidding?
You're a fuckin' sexpot.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.486
You think I'm a sexpot?

00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:05.721
Instant boner.

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.165
That's what I always
say about you.

00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:10.166

of humor.

Let's go fuck on
the kitchen floor.

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.600
There he is.

somewhere else?

Oh, my God, thank God
you said something.

00:19:53.080 --> 00:19:54.570
My knees hurt, like, really bad.
Oh, God.

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:55.721
They really hurt.

00:19:55.840 --> 00:19:57.365
I know. My tailbone
is killing me

00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.726
and I can see
my to-do list.

Yeah, all week. I've had
allergies all week.

00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.806
It's 'cause of the pressure change.
Oh, is that what it is?

Mmm.

00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:52.688

Totally work.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:53.881
This was like my move.

00:20:53.960 --> 00:20:55.530

What is happening?
It's okay.

00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:05.765
Is it possible that
we have somehow

00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.966
forgotten how to have sex?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.207
Do not say that. Because we
used to be great at this.

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.611
Yeah, we were. We were.

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.330
I was like Shaquille O'Neal
in the sack.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.526
I had that kind of game.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.648
What? Shaquille O'Neal's
a weird comparison.

00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.843
I'm just trying to say that I was
a dominant player. Yeah, I know.

00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.962
I would've gone with Derek Fisher for you.
Derek Fisher?

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:23.969
What? He's a great player. Okay.

00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:25.889
I feel like we're tryin' to
say the same thing. Okay.

00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:28.042
You were like LeBron James.
Oh, thanks, honey.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.408
We were like Derek Fisher
and LeBron James having sex.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.846
I'm saying we were
world-class.

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:35.684
And now,
what is happening?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:36.881
(SIGHS)

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.050

Yeah, but we're not dead!

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:46.288
I still think about
sex all the time.

00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:48.880
I know.
I use your computer.

00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:51.083
Oh, the porn.
Yeah.

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.562
You and I used to watch
porn together all the time.

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:55.404
I still watch porn
every once in a while.

00:21:55.520 --> 00:21:56.806
You do?
Yeah.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.480
But the quality of writing
has really gone downhill.

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.246
I like it best when it feels
like they're really in love.

00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.448
Yeah, I feel like we're getting
different things out of porn.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.520
Maybe.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:07.961
I just watch it for the
naked women having sex.

00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:09.121
And the porn guys

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.645
don't get in the way
or anything?

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.685
Don't even see 'em.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.728
They're completely
invisible to me.

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.090
Should we watch
some porn?

00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:18.766
Eh.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.484
Just feels
kind of depressing.

00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.607
Yeah.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:25.684
Do we have any
of that tequila left?

That's a good idea. That's a
really good idea. JAY: Right.

Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.647
We are gonna drink some tequila.
Whoo!

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.767

pull ourselves

sad little moment

that we're having
and after that...

We're gonna be Derek Fisher
and LeBron fucking James.

what we're gonna do.

Oh, yeah.

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.407
We don't even have to watch
it if we don't want to.

00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.130
Or we could.
Either way.

00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.045
Okay, honey,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:03.406
what's our storyline?

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.527
Story?
Yeah.

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:05.766
I'm not sure the story's
that important. Yeah.

Oh, come on.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.365

Well, I would like
to hear that idea.

Because you're clearly
in the zone.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.087
This is it.

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.889

Why, yes, l am, Annie.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:14.210

Wow. Wow. Okay.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.125
Look at that bush.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.201
Well, look at his bush.

00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.566
I'm talking about his bush.

00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.244
Is that still his bush?

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.009
I can't tell where her
bush ends and his begins.

00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:38.242

Can we start with something
other than missionary?

00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:51.648
Absolutely. We can loop
back around to missionary.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.524
Right. It's not goin' anywhere.

00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:56.001

what's happening?

That's my leg.
Yeah, okay.

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.209

Okay.

have seen us a month ago.

thinking of having more?

When did that happen?

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.726
Since when did kids graduate
from fourth and fifth grade?

had fun, right?

So what you're saying

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.042
is that instead of erasing the video
like you said that you would,

00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.770
you actually ended up
sending it

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:00.842

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.601
You did?

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.162
I'm supposed to be the model
Piper Brothers mother!

00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.004
Maybe he hasn't
seen it yet.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.527
As a matter of fact, Annie, I'm willing
to bet that none of these people

00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:32.728
have even noticed that the
video is on there yet.

00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:33.920
Except for this text, but...

00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:37.446
What text?

00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:39.449
I received a text.

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.561
From who?

00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.721
It's unclear.

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.320
(SIGHS)

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:50.047
I'm not sure how to hurt
you right now, Jay.

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.201
I know.

00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.680
But let's take a deep breath.
Shit!

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.041
Come sit down next to me.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.804
Come sit down. Come here.

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:56.961
Let's look at

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:59.327
what's actually happened.
Okay.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.720
We made a video

00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.360
of ourselves having sex

00:33:03.520 --> 00:33:04.806
for about three hours,

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.331
and it was amazing, right?

00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:07.811
Yeah, no, it was great.
Okay.

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:10.491
And then you asked me
to erase it and I forgot.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.848
You forgot?
I forgot.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.490
And now our video

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:17.723
has been synced
to several devices.

00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.051
All of which, though, are basically
in the possession of friends.

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.844
Oh, God.
And acquaintances.

00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:24.081
And the mailman.

00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:25.767
Oh, God!

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.285
Who sent you
that text, Jay?

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.481
I don't know.
I don't know, Annie.

00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.846
Did you call the number?

00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.890
That is actually
a really good idea.

00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:34.769
Oh, my God.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.049
<i>OPERATOR: Your call
has been forwarded...</i>

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.765
Voice mail!
Okay, oh.

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.763
Hi, this is Jay Hargrove.

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:46.486
Could you give me
a call back

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.528
at your earliest
convenience, please?

00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:51.366
I believe you have
the number. Bye.

00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:54.847
That's it?

00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:56.410
What the hell else was I
supposed to say to the guy?

00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.209
"Who the fuck is this?"

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.521
I wouldn't call back if someone
left that on my machine.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.644
Okay, we have to get
these iPads back right now.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:05.121
(PHONE RINGS)

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.761
Hello?

00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.569
Hi, Mom!
Hi, honey.

00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:10.722
<i>Is there any chance
that you might be able</i>

00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:13.565
to come and, um, watch the kids
for us, uh, like, right away?

00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:14.721
Right now?

00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.484
We really need you to,
like, right away

00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:17.971
<i>if you could come over.</i>

00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:19.530
Why, I suppose.

00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:21.688
Thanks, Mom. That's so great.
Thanks. (MOUTHING) Annie.

00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.841
Hold on a second. What?

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.524
It might be worth
asking your mom,

00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:26.805
um, to bring her iPad.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.484
Are you kidding me?

00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:31.004
And could you
bring your iPad, too?

00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.129
My iPad?
Yeah.

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:34.611
Okay.
<i>Great,</i> okay.

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:36.484
What are you not gonna forget?
The iPad.

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:38.961
So say goodbye, hang up
and then come right away.

00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:40.401
Okay. All right.

00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.608
Can you hang up?
Okay, honey.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:44.606
Okay, hang up now, Mom.

00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.091
Okay, say goodbye.

00:34:46.160 --> 00:34:47.241
Okay, hang up.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:49.322
Bye.
Okay, bye!

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.081
Who else
has these things?

00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.161
Let's think about it.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:54.840
Robby, the mailman...

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.762
Every time you say
"mailman," Jay,

00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.241
I'm just gonna hit you.

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.446
You see, it was Christmas...

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.567
I don't give a shit.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:05.486
Mailman, Robby, Hank,
my mother, and who else?

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:08.687
(GASPS) Oh, my God!

00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:09.761
Clive?

00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:11.683
ANNIE: May I see that for
a second, honey? Why?

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.762
Just for a second.
I was using that!

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.961
What the hell?

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.121
I can't take any chances.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.645
Okay, kid!
Come on, Jay!

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:21.126
Grandma's here for
some mysterious reason!

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.804
Oh, my gosh!
Is that the iPad

00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.530
I gave you?
I love that iPad.

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.563
Can I borrow it?
Why is Grandma here?

00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:28.961
Yay! Grandma!

00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:30.485
Okay. Grandma's gonna
watch you guys

00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:31.925
while Mommy
and Daddy go out.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:33.411
You guys can order
Chinese food.

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:35.130
CLIVE: I hate Chinese food.
Okay. Then order a pizza.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.770
Once again,
enjoy this iPad.

00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:38.330
I had to make sure it
was working. Enjoy that.

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.846
Let's go! Thank you.
What about my iPad?

00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.046
Thank you.

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.448
Man. The construction on these
things is just unbelievable.

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.124
Jay! Come on,
Jay, let's go!

00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:53.565
Let's go to Robby and Tess' house first!
Let's go!

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.085
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Sorry! Got it!

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.164
ANNIE: So I'm just
trying to understand

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.004
why it is that you
don't erase these things

00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.809
before you give
them to people.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.041
I have amazing playlists

00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.610
and people want them.
That's the gift.

00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.200
The gift is the playlist,
not the iPad.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.687
When I update my music library,
it syncs to their iPads.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.491
I use an app called Frankensync
to sync the playlists.

00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:16.403
I upgraded
to this new app,

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:18.005
Bride of Frankensync,

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.289
and now, apparently,
it syncs all of my shit

00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:24.166
to everywhere 'cause it's
a very powerful app!

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.449
How do you forget to
erase your sex tape?

00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:29.204
It kept slipping my mind

00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:31.362
and then, the next thing
I knew, it went up!

00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:33.010
It went up to the cloud!

00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.525
And you can't get it
down from the cloud?

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:35.761
Nobody understands
the cloud!

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.731
It's a fucking mystery!

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.201
Look, all that's happened
here is there's been a very

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.884
minor syncing mishap.

00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.200
This is not minor!

00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.726
And I wish that you would
just admit that you fucked up

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:49.451
instead of trying to convince
me that this isn't a big deal

00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.164
'cause it is a big deal.

00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:52.571
You know what, Annie?

00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:54.005
I'm on there, too.

00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.082
Oh, who gives a shit?
Nobody cares about you.

00:36:56.160 --> 00:36:57.889
Nobody wants to watch
you having sex.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.201
You said it yourself.
Nobody cares about the guy!

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:03.000
It's the woman that has to live with
it forever. (CELL PHONE CHIMES)

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.201
Who is it?
"Guess who?" Smiley face.

00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.486
Who the fuck is this?
Fuck!

00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:11.371
It's gotta be Tess.
It's gotta be Tess.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:12.891
You think?
Yeah!

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.288
With the whole "XOXO smiley face" thing?
Yeah. It's Tess.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.084
Right, is that really
a Tess thing,

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.164
or is that more of like a,
uh, very, very common thing?

00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.890
No, it's a Tess thing.

00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.849
She must just be
joking around.

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.049
Except her number is in my
phone so it would say, "Tess."

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.487
Well, maybe
she got a new phone.

00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:31.931
She probably saw
what it was

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.923
and stopped watching it
immediately

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.162
because she has so much
respect for our privacy.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:37.845
This makes perfect sense.

00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.770
Right. Okay.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.763
Okay, great. It's Tess.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.285
I'd buy it.
Yeah.

00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.442
She picks up the iPad, sees
there's a sex tape on there,

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.330
pushes play, it's us,
immediately stopped it,

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.129
'cause she respects us.
Yes.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.964
Then she went out and got a new
phone and a new phone number.

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.081
Yeah.

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.525
So do you think that means
Robby has seen it, too?

00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:56.762
Well, if he's seen it, you're gonna
have to get a new best friend.

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:59.047
We're just gonna cut Robby
and Tess out of our lives?

00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.647
Yeah, that's right. And if the
mailman has seen it, we're movin'.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.206
(GASPS) Wait.
What if it's not Tess?

00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:13.964
Okay, look. We're just
gonna feel this out,

00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:15.201
and if it doesn't
seem like it's her,

00:38:15.240 --> 00:38:17.163
we just don't say anything at all.
Okay? Of course.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:19.561
No, no. They do not need
to know about this. Okay?

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.125
Babe, it's gonna be
pretty easy

00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.168
to tell if they've
seen it or not.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.001

Hey!

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:33.246
Hey.
Hey!

00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.721
What's going on?

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:37.446
What's going on
with you?

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.731
Nothing. Nothing.
Just hanging out.

00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:43.005
It's our anniversary,
actually,

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.242
so Marta took Howard
to a movie

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:46.526
and we're just, uh,

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.410
hanging out,
watching some...

Hey! What are you
guys doing here?

00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:54.085
Hey-
Hey.

00:38:54.240 --> 00:38:56.811
We're so sorry to
drop by like this

00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.325
on your anniversary
and all.

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.091
Yeah, why didn't you guys mention
it was your anniversary?

00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:04.489
Uh, cause it's our 12th anniversary?
Yeah.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.121
Like, who cares, right?
So... (CHUCKLING)

00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.401
You guys wanna come in?

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:15.881
Or not.

00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:18.686
What were you guys
watching?

00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.690
(SIGHS)
Um... (CHUCKLES)

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:27.361
This is really embarrassing.
Yeah.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.124
Just tell us what
you guys were watching.

00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:31.160
Yeah. It's not a big deal.
What were you watching?

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.805
Okay, all right,
all right.

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.644
We're watching the first
season of Breaking Bad.

00:39:36.720 --> 00:39:38.370
TESS: It's really
embarrassing

00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.561
how far behind we are.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:41.051
ANNIE: That's a great show.
Yeah.

00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.531
You guys really
are far behind.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:43.801
That's all right.
Don't tell us what happens!

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.007
Hey, while we're here,

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:46.764
remember that iPad
I gave you?

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.047
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:50.131
I need that back.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:51.886
Oh, uh...

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.044
Okay. Oh, was that why you...

00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.400
Is that why you
came here

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:57.482
to our house,
to get your iPad back?

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.400
Well...
Um...

00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:04.084
I have some stuff on it
that I need.

00:40:04.160 --> 00:40:05.844
What? Dirty pictures
or something?

00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:08.244
(CHUCKLES) You guys
make a sex tape?

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.485
Did you guys watch it?

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.125
I was kidding.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.323
(QUIETLY)
What the fuck?

00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.367
And then Jay received
this text that said,

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:24.848
"Loved your video. Thanks
for sharing. XOXO."

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.888
And you thought
that was from me?

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.200
Well, it sounded like you.

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:30.920
I don't think if I'd seen your sex
tape, I would have done "XOXO."

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:33.004
I was hoping
it was you...

00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.491
Because if it wasn't me,
then who is it?

00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:35.846
No, I get it. I get it.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.844
Um... Could we back up
for just a second?

00:40:40.240 --> 00:40:41.890
So you taped yourself
having sex for three hours?

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.161
Yes.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.645
Why did you do that?

00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:47.565
Never mind.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:50.127
Who has sex for three hours?
We did.

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:53.044
That's the length of the movie Lincoln.
You did the full Lincoln.

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:55.571
Well, guys, I'm sorry,
you know,

00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.523
but I'm not the one
who sent that text.

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:00.327
God, this isn't happening. Oh...

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.641

to buy your blog?

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:12.843
And who's very concerned
about my image.

00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.921

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.525

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.361
I would have killed you.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:21.329
Oh, I mean, if you had thought
about it for a second,

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.846
you'd know to just
password-protect your shit.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.007
I would have killed
you in your sleep.

00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.366
Or just fucking delete it.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.247
Oh, my God, do you think
she knows where he lives?

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.368
Yeah, I think she's been to his house.
She's his florist!

00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:36.441
Hold on.
What's the plan here?

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.806
We're just gonna show up
at this guy's house?

00:41:37.880 --> 00:41:39.689
Yeah! And we're coming with you!

00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.250
Oh, my God. It'll be a fun night!
We have a sitter!

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.010
I'll call Rochelle.
Yeah!

00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.402
Hey, my sister thought the every
position thing was a great idea!

What is up?

I thought she'd be thrilled.

00:41:54.520 --> 00:41:55.521

00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:57.284

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:00.721

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.523

Yeah.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.526
You came over here
to get it.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.364
I need the iPad, please.

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:08.720
What if I can't
get it right now?

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:10.000
Just give me the iPad.

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.208
What if I just erase the
video myself? Dude.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:14.480
Okay. You're gonna have to
give me all that music again.

00:42:14.560 --> 00:42:16.927
Dude!
Oh, fine! Jeez!

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:23.124
Did you just pull
this out of your pants?

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:25.881
Yeah.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:27.371

00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:29.687
you said you couldn't
remember where it was.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:31.486
I forgot.

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.160
Fair enough.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.604
It's an easy mistake to make.
Okay.

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.291

gonna do?

00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.885
ROBBY: Yeah.
What's the plan, gang?

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.883
Should we pretend
we have a flat,

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.764
and none of us
had our cell phones?

00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:51.286
We knock. You're like, "Hank!
What a surprise!"

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.328
TESS: Yes. And then l
jump in and I say,

00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:55.289
"Hi. I'm your
florist's sister, Tess."

00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:56.850
Feel like this is just

00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.888

to spend your anniversary.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.406
For a 12th anniversary, I think it's
pretty solid. ANNIE: You know what?

It's our mess.

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.210
We can go clean it up.
Right, babe?

00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.169

to be part of the plan.

00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.571

in and out up there.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.286
We're gonna knock
on the door.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:13.289
Yes, it'll be a little
awkward at first.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:15.164
But I really think
it'll be fine.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:19.890
Okay, so this is what
we're gonna do.

00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.406
I'll distract him, you say you
have to go to the bathroom,

00:43:22.480 --> 00:43:25.165
and then you search the house for the iPad.
Good? Okay, let's go.

hold on one second?

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.601
Get up here.
That house is huge.

00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.364
We'll tell him
you have diarrhea.

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:32.165
First of all,
that's embarrassing.

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.641
And second of all, who tells
someone that they have diarrhea?

00:43:34.720 --> 00:43:35.960
Food poisoning.

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.327
Okay. How about I distract him
and you have the food poisoning?

00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.447
Uh, no. l am not gonna
have food poisoning.

00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.965
You're gonna have
food poisoning.

The person who
forgets to erase

00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.131
the sex tape
has food poisoning.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.565

in the neighborhood.

I didn't forget!

to keep the tape.

And I was gonna
keep it forever!

00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:30.449

what was one of the
greatest nights of my life.

00:58:32.800 --> 00:58:34.643

to keep it.

Yeah, you wanted it.

But I specifically didn't
want you to keep it

00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.850
because I didn't want it
to get out and guess what?

00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.968
It did! It did immediately.

00:58:47.040 --> 00:58:48.724

is not for you
to do more cocaine.

01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:40.450
Yeah, you do.
And look at you.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.090
Runnin' around
trying to collect up

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.481
all your iPads
before time runs out.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.403
Why didn't you
just remote wipe them?

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.406
You can do that?

01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:52.761
Fuck!

01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.321
Fuck me!

01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.810
I almost murdered a dog.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.681
Yeah.

01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:01.689
But I already uploaded
your sorry-ass video

01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:02.966
to a site called YouPorn.

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.765
Should be up by
tomorrow morning.

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.888
And sadly, the only one that
can take the video down

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.610
is the original poster
and that's me.

01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:10.649
Okay, this is a...

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.569
I got it.
This is a joke, right?

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.841
You're joking.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.329

Hmm.

01:04:20.680 --> 01:04:22.011
You want an Xbox?

01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:24.282
You can get me an Xbox?
Do you want an Xbox?

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:26.284
Like, the new Xbox?
Yeah.

What do I look
like to you, Jay?

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.211
A fucking idiot? No!

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.891
I want $25,000 in cash.

01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:34.645
$25,000?

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:38.765
Howard. First of all, I don't
have $25,000 just sittin' around.

01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:41.241
And besides, what are you
gonna do with $25,000?

01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:42.685
I'm gonna buy a horse.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.763
Yeah, I'm gonna buy
a motherfucking horse

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.285
to keep my bitches happy-

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.122
I think it's time for me to have
a little talk with your parents.

01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.321
Try. Go ahead.

01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:52.760
I'll lie.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.444
They're gonna
believe me. Not you.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.961
Oh...

01:04:56.040 --> 01:04:57.724
And don't you dare
tell Annie about this.

01:04:58.400 --> 01:04:59.731
I'm gonna tell Annie.

01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.401
Okay-

01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:03.323
But before you do,
just think about

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:04.925
these three words
for me, all right?

01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:06.684

You're fucked!

Good talk, pal.
Seriously.

Let's go home
and keep calling

that number until
someone answers.

01:05:25.800 --> 01:05:27.689

who's sending these texts.

Uh-oh. Wanna do
the thing?

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.405
Wanna do the four-flavor
thing?

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:34.482
Yeah, let's do that thing. Yeah.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.926
Robby, there's no easy way
for me to say this,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.321
but your kid is trying
to blackmail me

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:42.845
for $25,000!

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.567

yourself right now?

01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:48.724
I mean, look. You've had
a stressful day, right?

He's not your problem.</i>

01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:53.289
When you wake up,
you'll realize that.

Would you just go
check his computer, huh?

01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.327

I'm not gonna look
at his computer.

<i>Because there's nothing
on there.</i>

01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:03.404

and I trust him.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:04.880

talking about this now.

Hi. You can't keep
doing that to me.

What are you doing, Jay?

You can do that?
Yes, you can.

We did it.

(SIGHS)
So, yeah.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.480
In a way it would've been nice to
have that information earlier.

01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:43.006
In another, more
important way,

01:07:43.480 --> 01:07:46.529
it's great news
that we have

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:48.807
remote wiped
the mailman's iPad.

this little freak show

is gonna be so

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.490

what we did with the salami!

Babe, can I say
something that's gonna

01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.124
sound kinda crazy,
but just go with me?

01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:21.844
All right? I've been
watching a bunch of

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:23.001
these videos online,

01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:25.242
and you cannot
really tell

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:27.561
who these people are.
Mostly.

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:28.880
And I'm sure
that they all have

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:31.128
somebody that they don't
want seeing their videos,

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.440
but they make them anyway.

01:08:32.520 --> 01:08:34.204
Like this one video I saw,

01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.771
"Corn-fed Cowgirl
Gets Milked."

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.723
There is no way that she
wanted her boss seeing that

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.640
because what happened there
seemed very personal.

01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.406
Your point is?
My point is,

01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.802
if our video went up there,
God forbid,

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.087
does anybody even know
that it's us?

01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:50.969
And if they did,

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.802
does it really matter
that much?

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.050
I mean, it might.

01:08:57.400 --> 01:08:59.482

Rosenbaum might not care.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.966
he might.

Is it made by
Piper Brothers?

01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:21.446
Look, my point is,

01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:25.650
maybe everybody has an 11-inch
dildo in their nightstand.

01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:29.122
That's a beautiful metaphor, honey.
Thank you.

01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:30.805
I thought of it just then.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.202

so much

other people think.

I'll watch it.

And at least,
then, we'll know

anything.

hides bigger problems.
