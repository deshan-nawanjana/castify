WEBVTT

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.800
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.900
No, no, son. Over here.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.300
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.800
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.200
and be like your daddy someday,
you gotta learn how to fight.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.900
Da-da.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.600
Now, Alakay, let me
show you something, OK?

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.000
You see this mark?

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.600
You and me are the same.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.100
When you're bigger,
you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.000
Now let me see you fight. Ready?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.700
No, Alakay. No dancing!

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.700
You just amuse yourself, don't you?

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.500
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one. I'm...

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.800
Now, come on, let's try it again.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.800
No, Alakay.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.300
Stop that right now. Doggone it!

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.900
It's so disappointing when they
don't grow up the way you want.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.300
Makunga. You're not
challenging me again, are you?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.800
Look on the bright side. After I defeat
you and become alpha lion,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.000
you'll have more time
to spend with your pathetic son.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.400
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.000
Why do you want
to become the alpha lion?

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.400
I'm better looking, I have better hair,
I'm deceivingly smart...

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.800
...and I want everyone else
to do what I say.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.100
We fight on three. One...

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.300
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.000
Two, three!

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.900
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.000
Don't you forget it.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.100
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:51.600
Alakay?

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.500
That's it. Here, kitty, kitty.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.400
This one's a beauty.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.700
He'll be worth a few bucks.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.000
Itjust gets easier and easier.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.300
Daddy!

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.300
Alakay! Alakay!

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.700
Alakay!

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.300
Da-da!

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.800
No! No! No!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Alakay!

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.800
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you! Hold on!

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.200
Da-da!

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900
Alakay!

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.400
Daddy!

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.300
I've been around the world
in the pouring rain

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.800
Feeling out of place
and feeling strange

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.800
Take me to a place
where they know my name

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.200
'Cause I ain't met nobody
that looks the same

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.400
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.100
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.300
I'm a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.400
He's a fish out of water
Lion out of the jungle

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.900
I need my peoples, my peoples
Take me to my peoples

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.700
Play thatjungle fever
Show 'em some love

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.800
Show love

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.300
Just gotta have someone
Gotta have someone

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.000
To relate to, to relate to

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.800
I'm feeling right at home

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.100
Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.600
Feeling right at home
I'm feeling right at home

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.100
See I been traveling
Been traveling forever...

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.500
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.700
He's kind of a showoff.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.100
You think he's cute?

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.500
Roar!!

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.200
The King of New York City...

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.300
...Alex the Lion!

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.600
I still think he's kind of a showoff.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.700
The guy's an animal.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.800
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.800
Come on, where would we go on vacation?

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.400
I don't know about you,
but I want to go to Connecticut!

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.700
On the loose, several animals, including
the world famous Alex the Lion,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.900
escaped from
the Central Park Zoo tonight.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.200
The escapees were cornered
in Grand Central Station.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.400
He was a very bad kitty.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.400
Animal rights activists,
who convinced zoo officials

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.700
to have the animals sent to Africa,

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.100
were stunned to learn
that the freighter carrying the animals

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.800
was reported missing today.

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.000
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers
have gathered at the zoo

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.600
to mourn the loss
of their beloved zoo animals.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:46.700
The question on everyone's mind,
where are they now?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.300
I like to move it, move it

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.200
He likes to move it, move it

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.200
She likes to move it, move it

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.000
- We like to
- Move it!

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.500
Come on! Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.300
- We like to
- Move it!

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.800
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.300
Glad we could introduce
you to the toilet.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:51.400
If you ever come look us up in
Manhattan, feel free to call first.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.100
Seriously though, call. OK?

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.200
Settle down, everybody. Be quiet!

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.300
You can't leave without this!

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.700
Surprise, freaks!

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.500
Shake it! Shake it.

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.400
Look, I'm a lady! I'm a lady, everyone!

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.800
I'm a lady! Not really!
It's me, King Julien!

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.000
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:27.100
Hey, freaks! You will be very glad
to hear that I am coming with you.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.800
Oh, no, thank you.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.200
Yes, thank you. It's my plane!

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:38.200
Until I return with the spoils
from the new country...

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:41.300
...Stevie will be in charge!

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:48.200
I don't think they like that idea.

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.500
What are you saying, Stevie?

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.400
No.

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.000
Could we...? No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.900
Naughty little thing! Stevie says...

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Let them eat cake!

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
King Julien, wait for me!

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.300
I'm all packed! I have
a whole itinerary planned!

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.400
Oh, no! It's Mort! He's so annoying!

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600
Don't let him on. Stop that thing!

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.700
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.700
Everybody in! Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:27.200
- Struts.
- Check.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400
- Flaps.
- Check.

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.100
- Engine. Coffee maker.
- Check.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.200
You guys!

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.700
Copsie-daisy!

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.700
That has to be the second biggest
slingshot I've ever seen.

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:44.200
But it'll have to do. Attention.

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:45.900
This is your captain speaking.

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:49.100
In the event of an emergency,
place the vest over your head

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.100
then kiss your... good-bye.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.300
New York City, here we come!

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.100
Pray to your personal God
this hunk ofjunk flies.

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.300
Personal God, hunk...? What?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.700
We are go, sir.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.900
Open the door! I'm outside!

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:05.900
If cabin pressure is lost,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:09.700
place the mask over your face
to hide your terrified expression.

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.900
Miss, aren't these supposed
to be attached to my seat?

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:16.400
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!

00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:19.100
Launch!

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.300
- Launch!
- Launch!

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.600
Gremlin!

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.500
Hey, Mort.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:09.700
Hi!

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:14.900
That was weird.

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.200
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:20.300
You got Madagascar on the brain.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.900
I know I'm gonna miss it.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.400
It was incredible. I think it'll seem
more fun the further we are from it.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.100
Like when you bit me on the butt?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.600
I'm gonna take that thing you're
holding onto and use it onstage.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.400
It's all part of my little actor's salad
bar of emotional tidbits.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.300
Are the butts next to the croutons?

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:42.600
You don't need to be sarcastic.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.100
When we get back, I might sign up
for the breeding program.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.200
Breeding program?

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.500
We reach a point when we
want to meet somebody.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.000
Settle down, have a relationship.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.200
I can see that.

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:58.500
What? Like dating?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.100
Yeah, dating.

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:02.700
Other... other guys?

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.000
What do you mean, other guys?

00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.900
Darn it!

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.000
What is holding up
that beverage service?!

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.200
I'm gonna go check.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.700
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.700
It's so funny!

00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:27.800
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!

00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:29.100
To laugh!

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.900
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.800
It's nothing personal. We're just better
than you. Maurice, I'm open! Hit me!

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.200
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.000
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.800
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.

00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.000
We were checking on our drink order.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.200
Sorry. Been a little backed up.

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.900
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.500
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.700
What happened to
the separation of the classes?

00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.600
I'm sure this democracy thing
is just a fad.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.100
We'll go out for pineapple,
my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.700
Skipper, look.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.500
Analysis.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:18.700
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate
something unusual, like a malfunction.

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.000
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.000
That too, sir.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:23.400
Right! Rico?

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.700
Manual!

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.500
Problemo solved.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.000
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.700
We've lost engine one...

00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.500
...and engine two is no longer on fire.

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:38.300
Buckle up, boys.

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:40.900
Don't look, doll. This might get hairy.

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.500
Attention! This is your captain.

00:13:43.700 --> 00:13:47.200
I have good and bad news. The good
news is, we're landing immediately.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.500
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:56.400
When it comes to air travel,
we know you have no choice.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.500
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.300
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.000
I can fly!

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.900
This could be it, Marty! I want you to
know you are a one-in-a-million friend!

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.100
Thanks, buddy! You're the best ever!

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:30.700
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.600
I broke your iPod!

00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.300
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.700
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.600
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.400
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!

00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:44.500
I love you, Gloria! I always have!

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:56.700
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book. Or the beach.

00:15:07.900 --> 00:15:10.400
Goodness, doll,
you're shaking like a leaf.

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:12.400
Rico, you've had your fun.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.700
Pull up.

00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:17.300
Gear down.

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.500
Gently. You just want
to kiss the ground.

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.400
Just a peck, a smooch,
like you'd kiss your sister.

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.500
I said, kiss it!

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.700
Now just a little brake. Just a touch.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.400
I believe that's checkmate.

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.100
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up! Deploy!

00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.100
Oh, we're here.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.000
What in the world?

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.800
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:17.300
I'm OK. I'm alive.

00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:21.400
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:23.500
Kowalski, casualty report.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.500
Two passengers unaccounted for.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.500
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.200
Who says a penguin can't fly?

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:36.200
Hey, happy slappers! Is there some
reason to celebrate? Look at the plane!

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.900
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.800
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:45.900
We should be up and running
in, say, six to nine months.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.900
- Sixty-nine months?!
- No, six to nine months.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.700
Kowalski, I say we use
this setback to our advantage.

00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.000
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:57.800
How do you estimate that?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.400
Pretty boy! Why don't
you and your friends dig a latrine.

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.700
Hold on. Who made you king
of the plane wreck?

00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:09.100
Excuse me? Fine. You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.600
Who gives you the authority
to put me in charge?

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.700
OK, then I'll remain in charge.

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.600
Yeah, you will remain in charge.

00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.400
You and your hippie friends
stay out of our hair.

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.300
Correcto-mundo. Because I decided to.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.200
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.600
Higher mammals! Stay with us.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.700
We could use your front cortexes
and opposable thumbs.

00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:34.700
Phil! I should wash
your hands out with soap.

00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:38.500
How in the hell-o
will they fix this plane?!

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.600
You know, grit and spit and spit.

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.500
A lot of spit and grit and
stick-to-it-iveness.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.800
That don't sound too promising.

00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:49.400
You're right. We're stuck here.

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:53.500
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.900
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:59.300
Behold! The lion!

00:17:59.400 --> 00:18:02.000
- People!
- There is much to see. Moving on.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.400
Wait, wait, wait! People!

00:18:06.400 --> 00:18:08.300
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.100
- People! Stop!
- Help us!

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.800
If you stop, I'll autograph those!

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:17.400
I know you!

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.500
You.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.600
It's the bad kitty.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.600
How do you like some of that?!

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:51.800
Come in, Tokyo!

00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:00.000
Right in the batteries.

00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.900
You think an old lady
can't take care of herself?

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.300
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:08.700
Thank you, dear.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:10.300
Moving on!

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.800
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?!

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.100
Out of my mind?

00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.000
Who's out of my mind now?

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.400
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.

00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:27.800
Out of my mind. We're going home.

00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.500
Message E-4.

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:44.400
The service user has roamed
outside the coverage area.

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.000
Please try again later.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.000
Am I trippin'?

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.500
All those zebras... like me.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.200
- Where are we?
- San Diego.

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.900
This time I'm 40 percent sure.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.500
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:06.800
Africa?

00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:08.400
It's got to be.

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:11.200
Our ancestral crib.

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:13.700
It's in our blood. I can feel it!

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:16.400
No, it's more than that. It's like...

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:19.600
...d�j� vu, like I've been here before.

00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.400
It's like Roots!

00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:23.100
No, it's like...

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.600
...d�j� vu, like I've been here before.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.900
How!

00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.100
How!

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:38.600
Me Alex!

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:42.100
Me and me friends fly,

00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:45.400
fly in great metal bird.

00:20:46.900 --> 00:20:49.100
Then plummet!

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:51.400
Smash ground!

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:53.900
Go boom!

00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.300
Then here we emerge.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.600
We offer only happiness

00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:03.400
and good greetings.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.800
Is he dancing about a plane crash?

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.300
Yeah. We just... yeah.

00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.300
I thought... Sorry.

00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:13.500
You came from off the reserve?

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:16.600
Way off. From the Central Park Zoo,
actually.

00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:26.000
Don't strain yourself.

00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.400
What's going on here?

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:31.200
They say they're from off the reserve.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.700
That's impossible. Only people
come from off the reserve.

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.900
You look familiar. Do I know you?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.500
How could you survive the hunters?

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.900
We didn't see any hunters.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.800
- What are you looking at?
- Me? Nothing.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:47.100
This watering hole doesn't need
any more mouths to feed.

00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:49.700
So skedaddle back
to where you came from.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:52.100
Is there a manager we could talk to?

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:55.200
I see. You're here to challenge me!

00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.000
What? No! No.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.900
That's what it looks like to me!

00:21:59.200 --> 00:22:00.500
Zuba! Wait.

00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:02.500
I'm trying to take care of business...

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:05.200
Yeah, yeah, Zuba. Hold on.

00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.200
Alakay?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.300
Is that you?

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.900
No, it's Alex. lx. Like New York Knicks.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:15.300
Zuba, look!

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.300
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.700
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.

00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:22.400
A mark.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.000
All right, this is a little weird.

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.200
Honey, he's come home.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.200
What?

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:33.200
You've come home.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.600
Son.

00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:49.900
Dad.

00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:55.000
Mom and Dad? Mom and Dad!

00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.400
Mom and Dad! It's my mom and dad!

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:01.000
I got a mom and dad!

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:02.600
My baby's alive!

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.200
Dad!

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:06.100
My son!

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:09.400
My son is home!

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:14.400
Alakay! Alakay has come home!

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:22.900
Alakay! Yeah! The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!

00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:25.400
I thought you hated Zuba.

00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:30.200
No, I do. I do. I do.
I hate him. Oh, I do.

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.800
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:36.400
I'm going to use him
to get rid of Zuba once and for all!

00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.300
Giddy-up, feathered horse!

00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:41.200
Make way!
Move out of the way! Stand aside!

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.900
New York!

00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.200
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?

00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.500
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.900
This calls for a celebration!

00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:54.800
Maurice, I think they like me.

00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:57.400
You've got to love
a non-hostile takeover!

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:00.800
Chukka-chukka what?

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:11.400
Excuse me. I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.

00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.900
Hey, Marty!

00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:20.400
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?

00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:23.100
Yeah. Running is crack-a-lackin'.

00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:25.900
That's right! Crack-a-lackin'.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
You guys speak
my crack-a-lackin' language.

00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.500
What? You don't have doctors here?

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.100
Not anymore.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.600
Well, what if you catch a cold?

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.800
We go over to the dying holes
and we die.

00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.600
You guys really need a doctor.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.800
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?

00:24:46.900 --> 00:24:49.400
Me? A doctor?

00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:57.700
It's raining men. Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.800
Why don't you have a man? You got worms?

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.400
Oh, I got rid of those. Listen, girls.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.500
Manhattan is short on two things,
parking and hippos.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.700
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:13.800
is a doggone king!
The King of New York!

00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.600
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.

00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.300
All right. This one
always knocks 'em dead.

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.200
Roar!

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.400
Look out. The King is mad.
The King is mad!

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:32.300
Let's welcome him back
into the pride with open arms!

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.800
Welcome to the herd, Marty!

00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.300
Me? I've always wanted
to be part of a herd!

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.700
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.800
How do I look?

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:53.100
Technically, a traditional witch doctor
has a bone through his nose.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.700
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.

00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:58.500
Voil�! He's a witch doctor!

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:01.100
My mother will be so happy.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.100
Look out! I think Moto Moto likes you.

00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:12.900
Here he comes.

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:17.500
I like 'em big

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.900
I like 'em chunky

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:24.100
I like 'em big
I like 'em plumpy

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:27.900
I like 'em round
With somethin' somethin'

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:31.200
They like my sound
They think I'm funky

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.600
Goodness, girl... you huge.

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.900
Who's your friend? Or is that your butt?

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:39.400
You as quick as you are hefty.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.000
So you're Moto Moto?

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.300
The name's so nice, you say it twice.

00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:46.200
I kind of like it, fatso.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.500
I'll see you around, girl. It won't
be hard, because you so... plumpy.

00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:58.900
Cops!

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.200
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba,

00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.700
but some of the lions were wondering
when you plan to banish your son.

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.200
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:13.900
They're griping that Alakay
never went through

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.100
the rite of passage,
blah, blah, blah,

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.600
so technically speaking, he can't be
a member of the pride. It's nonsense.

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:24.000
I forgot about the rite of passage.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.300
What is it? What's this rite of passage?

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.900
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:32.700
Young lions earn their manes
by demonstrating their skills.

00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.500
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah. Strutting their stuff.

00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.700
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.

00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:43.600
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff. Earn my mane.

00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.400
I want to be Alaki.

00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.800
- Alakay.
- Alakay! Even better.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.500
We will hold the rite
of passage in the morning!

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:53.300
That's wonderful! Good luck, Alakay.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.600
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."

00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:57.900
That's my boy!

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:07.100
I'm a private dancer

00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.600
A dancer for money

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.500
Any old music will do

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.200
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.300
It's amazing.

00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:28.500
Guys...

00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.200
...this is where we belong.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.300
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.

00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.400
Oh, I like that one.

00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.200
It works on many levels.

00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:41.100
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.700
- That, too.
- Absolutely.

00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:44.600
Stations.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.600
Stage one. Go!

00:29:00.700 --> 00:29:03.200
Oh, no! What have I done?

00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:04.800
Come on, take the bait.

00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.500
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.

00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:09.100
Is it dead?

00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.300
Stage two! Go, go, go!

00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.500
I will give him the kiss of life.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:25.200
Rico!

00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:30.200
Rico!

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.800
Reverse!

00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:34.900
Gas!

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.200
Music!

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.600
No! Stop! Stop!

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.600
Stop!

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.100
Come back!

00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.900
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?!

00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.200
Is she dead?

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000
No!

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.100
You hoodlums!

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:11.900
Good heavens! Are you OK?

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.200
Lady, I found your pocketbook.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:19.000
My handbag. Such a good boy.

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:21.300
Nana can't survive without it.

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.500
You are one tough cookie.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.600
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.

00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:30.400
OK, nobody panic! The best thing
we can do is stay together.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:34.100
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...

00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.300
Where are you going?

00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:40.700
I'm not staying here to be attacked
by more animals! I'm too old to die.

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:45.600
I'm going with her. Old lady, wait up!

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.400
Please! We need to stay...

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.300
...together.

00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:53.400
Fine! We'll go that way!

00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:56.100
Does anyone want a hard candy?

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.300
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.800
And right here... OK, are you ready?

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.000
This is where you always slept.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:12.800
Oh, man!

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.100
- Was this mine?
- Look at you. Look at him.

00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:23.600
Oh, this thing. Look, look!

00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.500
- I remember this!
- He remembers.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.500
A little harder than...

00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:32.500
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.

00:31:33.300 --> 00:31:34.500
Is that...?

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.100
Is that my...?

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:39.500
Is that me?

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.200
You had the cutest little paws.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.800
Little, little bitty ol' paws.

00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:47.800
You did that the day we lost you.

00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:51.800
Wow. I was so young.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:53.900
What happened to me?

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:58.400
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...

00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.400
It was not your fault.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.700
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.400
Far off the reserve.

00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.700
Finally, I had to assume the hunters...

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:12.200
...well...

00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:15.800
We thought they'd killed you.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:20.500
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.300
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.700
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.000
You used to call this "foofie."

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:32.600
"Foofie"?

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.800
Foofie.

00:32:34.900 --> 00:32:36.400
He doesn't want that.

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:38.100
This is my foofie!

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.100
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.

00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:47.400
I mean, no, thank you,
thank you. It's perfect.

00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:51.100
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.600
You'll need all your strength.

00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:56.100
I will bring the house down for you.

00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.200
I hope so. Otherwise,
your father will have to banish you.

00:33:00.800 --> 00:33:02.200
Jeez, Mom, really?

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.500
I know you'll do us proud. You know why?

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.400
You were born with it.

00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:12.400
Good night, Alakay.

00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:15.400
My boy. My own boy.

00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:19.800
My son's a king.

00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.800
My son's a king.

00:33:32.900 --> 00:33:34.500
Good night, Mom.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:37.500
Good night, Alakay.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:45.600
Foofie.

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:48.500
Look at foofie! My foofie!

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.700
Foofie, foofie, foofie. My foofie!

00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:58.300
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.

00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:00.600
I think we're lost.

00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.500
Nana, do you know where you're going?

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:08.200
No, but I'm going with a skip
in my step and a smile on my face.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.600
Sure, right, OK. Yeah, all right.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.800
- It's people.
- How did you get here?

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:18.600
- Can you help us? We're lost.
- We're lost too.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:23.300
It was awful. A flash of black and white
and they were gone. They took the jeep!

00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:26.100
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:27.600
How will we all survive?

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:31.600
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?!

00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.600
You can let nature
get the best of you,

00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.100
or you can get the best of nature.

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:45.400
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.700
Yeah.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:50.300
We survive the concrete jungle!

00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:53.800
When we need food, we hunt
for a decent hot dog stand.

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:55.500
- Am I right?
- She's right.

00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:59.000
When we need shelter,
we build skyscrapers.

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:03.600
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.800
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.300
If we can make it there,

00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.900
we can make it anywhere!

00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:29.200
I'm coming, King Julien!

00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.100
Bad fishy! Bad fishy!

00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:42.100
No, shark, no! Sit!

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.300
Why am I laughing?

00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:54.200
We have all the parts we need,
but we're slightly behind schedule.

00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:56.600
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.900
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.700
Private! What happened to our thumbs?

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:04.900
Haven't seen them since yesterday.

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:06.800
Darn you, Darwin!

00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:11.800
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private! You're coming with me.

00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.800
Rico! You're coming with me!

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:19.400
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!

00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:23.100
We've recruited
a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.

00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:31.500
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.600
Oh, I doubt that.

00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:42.300
Enough lollygagging. Let's get to work.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:46.400
There'll be three groups. Group Alpha
will do sheet metal fabrication.

00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:50.700
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.200
Any questions?

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:55.000
Good! Let's get to work.

00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:05.200
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.

00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:09.000
All right, but you're so darn ugly.

00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:19.600
Remember, little cub scouts, a great
dance performance comes from the heart.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:23.000
Straight from the heart,
you'll never go wrong.

00:37:24.900 --> 00:37:26.000
Sure, mister.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.100
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by,
I thought I'd wish you luck.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.600
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.

00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:37.500
In my opinion, the key to this
is choosing the right competitor.

00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:40.800
You mean, this is like
a dance battle sort of thing?

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.900
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.

00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.400
Great. I love that. Freestyle.

00:37:45.700 --> 00:37:49.500
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.

00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.500
Well, I wish I could help,

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.400
but that's strictly against our ancient
tradition and all we hold sacred.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.200
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.300
Teetsi. OK. Sounds interesting.

00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:05.900
Makunga, right? Thank you.

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.600
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.

00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:10.200
Shake it out.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.700
A five, six, seven, eight.

00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:15.400
Let's go, let's do this.

00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:36.300
Let us begin
the rite of passage ceremony.

00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:39.700
- Come on, baby! Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:40.900
On it, Mom!

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.800
Who will be the first participant?

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:45.400
Me! Oh! Me, me, me!
Me! Me! Me! Me, me! Please, me?

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:48.100
How about you? The tall, handsome one.

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.100
Yeah. Choose your opponent.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.400
Let me see.

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.100
I guess I'll pick...

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200
...Teetsi?

00:39:02.200 --> 00:39:04.700
Teetsi? Why did he pick Teetsi?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.300
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!

00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:11.000
Somebody, wake him up!

00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.400
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?

00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:32.000
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff. Bring it.

00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:34.200
- Let's dance!
- OK.

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.100
But let me warn you
that I am a prot�g� of...

00:39:37.300 --> 00:39:40.000
...Fosse and Robbins!

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.800
Not "dance" dance! Fight!

00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:46.000
Dance fight! You got it.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.600
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?

00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.000
I know that boy is not dancing.

00:39:57.700 --> 00:39:59.800
This is even better than I thought.

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.200
Alakay, turn around!

00:40:04.300 --> 00:40:08.500
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle,
ball change, hip swish, turn around.

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.900
Oh, no.

00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:23.300
Alakay! Are you hurt?

00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:25.300
Yeah, I am.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:27.300
Did I... did I win?

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:28.700
No, son.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.900
How could this happen?

00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:35.000
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.

00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.100
I am a king. I'm the King of New York.

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:43.600
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.

00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.800
Perform?

00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:49.200
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!

00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.500
Who would have ever imagined
that today Zuba would have to banish...

00:40:55.100 --> 00:40:56.700
...his own son?

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.900
Zuba, no.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.800
Zuba, yes.

00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:05.000
Sadly, the alpha lion
must cast out all failures.

00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:20.100
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.

00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:22.800
Dad, what are you doing?

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:26.000
Dad, no! You can't do this.

00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:30.700
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?

00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:33.000
Anyone?

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:35.200
Someone? No one?

00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.600
You, sir!

00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:39.300
I guess not.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.300
Well, I... this is all very awkward,

00:41:42.700 --> 00:41:46.200
but I suppose I could carry
this tremendous burden.

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.200
Teetsi! Get the hat.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.700
As your new leader,
I hereby banish Alakay!

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:58.000
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.000
...and leave the watering hole

00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:03.900
for a thousand years, or life!

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.900
Whichever comes last.

00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:12.700
Shoo, shoo! Get out of here!

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:17.200
You should have told us
you weren't a real king, son!

00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.900
You never told me
I'd have to fight anybody!

00:42:19.900 --> 00:42:21.200
What did you expect?!

00:42:21.300 --> 00:42:25.800
I don't know! Maybe a little fatherly
advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:28.700
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!

00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:30.700
No, I guess not. You dance!

00:42:30.800 --> 00:42:34.800
And other stuff! Your pal, Makunga,
set me up back there!

00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:37.700
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.500
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!

00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.900
A real lion.

00:42:43.900 --> 00:42:45.200
Thanks.

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:50.100
Thanks a lot.

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.300
Saw.

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:03.900
Suture.

00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:07.100
Swab.

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:08.700
You're in my light, Stephen.

00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:11.600
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.

00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:16.400
That's very observant, Stephen. As you
can see, I'm covered in brown spots.

00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.100
OK! That bone will be good
as new in a few weeks.

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.500
So I don't have
to pick out a dying hole?

00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:25.000
No, you got
your whole life ahead of you.

00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.600
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.

00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:31.300
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg! Sweet kid.

00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:34.400
This spot looks
like Witch Doctor's Disease.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.800
Witch Doctor's Disease? That's the most
ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.

00:43:40.600 --> 00:43:43.000
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.

00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:45.700
This won't hurt a bit.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.200
Joe, our last witch doctor,
had a spotjust like that.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.500
- And?
- Monday, Joe. Wednesday, no Joe.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.500
Wednesday, no Joe?

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:59.100
I can breathe! Thanks, doc!

00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.200
So this Witch Doctor's Disease
is a real thing?

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:07.100
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.300
But I've never heard of it.

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.600
I mean... I don't have any penicillin.

00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.100
I'll need a CAT scan
just to get started!

00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:18.500
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.

00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.200
Ta-da!!

00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.100
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.700
Hollah!

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:39.000
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.000
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:43.800
Well, you can try all you want to,

00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:45.900
but it takes years of practice.

00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:48.000
You'll never get a tight stream

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.500
until you build up your lip muscles
to the point where you can

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.700
purse your lips like this.
You got it?

00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.700
Ta-da!

00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.800
How did you...? You guys got it
right out of the box!

00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.700
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.

00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.000
It's in our blood!

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.000
I always thought I was a bit unique.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.200
We are unique!

00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.300
We are like a force of nature!

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:29.200
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!

00:45:29.300 --> 00:45:31.500
Exactly the same!

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.900
Exactly the same.

00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:39.900
Looks impressive,
Kowalski, but will it fly?

00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:43.700
Yes. If we fold it here, here and here.

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:46.900
Nice.

00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:03.400
Oh, man. My dad thinks
I'm a total loser.

00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.400
I've ruined my parents' lives.

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:07.600
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.

00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:12.300
It is lackin' in the crackin',
my friend. I've gotta fix this.

00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:13.800
So...

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:18.300
...there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.400
Hey, guys.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:22.400
Is this place great or what?!

00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:24.400
I'd go with "or what."

00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:28.100
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but...

00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:31.100
...I got a date with Moto Moto.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.500
Who's Moto Moto?

00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:37.100
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!

00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.800
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.800
It means, "Hot Hot."

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.100
"Hot Hot"?

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:46.000
When did you start parlez-ing African?

00:46:46.300 --> 00:46:47.200
It's in my blood.

00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:51.100
Don't worry, you can flirt around
with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.

00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:54.100
Melman, why am I the parade
and you're the rain?

00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.300
Why are you driving
your parade under my rain?

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:59.100
Maybe I'll parade
in another part of town!

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.500
Whoa, guys.

00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.200
Main Street's mine!

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:04.500
Well, you can have it!

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.700
And you can take your hotee-tot float
and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:10.900
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.500
Melman, just tell her.

00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:16.500
What? What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.100
I guess I'll go, then.

00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.600
Don't bother.

00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:23.300
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman! Gloria!

00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:27.700
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.

00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:29.500
- Marty?
- Marty?

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.800
Marty?

00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.400
What the heck is going on?

00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:38.600
You're not...? Oh! He was... I thought
he... You're not him. He's... Oh.

00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:41.500
You thought that guy...

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.800
...was me?

00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:45.600
No. I mean, yes, you... Guys, come on.

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:47.900
You thought I was him?

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:50.200
You guys kind of do look a little...

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.900
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.900
You laugh alike. Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on. Marty.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.300
So you're saying there's
nothing unique about me.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.600
I'm just like any other zebra.

00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.200
No. Of course you're different!

00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.900
How?

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.700
OK, I can't tell you apart.

00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:15.900
Maybe you could wear
a bell or something.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.600
- A bell?!
- OK, not a bell. Bell's a bad idea.

00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:21.600
How about a T-shirt that says,
"I'm with stupid"?

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.300
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid! Him, stupid!

00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:27.900
You know, while you've been doing
the prancing pony with your new posse,

00:48:28.200 --> 00:48:31.400
I've been having
the worst day of my life.

00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:35.100
It's always about you, isn't it?

00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.700
My problems are just
a little bit bigger than yours.

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.600
I couldn't tell you apart. So what?!

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:44.900
Yeah, fine. Run away, Marty! Run away!

00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:48.300
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!

00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.800
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.300
Your one-of-a-million friend
hopes you enjoy

00:48:57.400 --> 00:49:00.200
your bigger-than-anyone-else's
problems alone!

00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:03.900
Good, leave! I don't need you
to help me solve my problems!

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.100
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!

00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.200
Which one's Marty? Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!

00:49:10.300 --> 00:49:13.000
Nice hat, you showoff!

00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:19.800
Marty...

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.300
...don't go.

00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.000
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.300
Giddy-up, giddy-up!

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:28.600
Look, Maurice!

00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.200
The perfect spot for my summer palace!

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.300
Please fill in all these holes
and relocate the riff-raff.

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:39.700
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Tell me about it. I'm in my prime here.

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.600
I'm terminal, you know?

00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:50.100
I probably only have
another two days left to live.

00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:52.500
That's a bummer, man.

00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.500
If I, King Julien... that's my name...

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.000
...only had two days left to live,

00:49:58.300 --> 00:49:59.800
I would do all the things

00:49:59.800 --> 00:50:02.300
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?

00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:05.400
I'd love to become
a professional whistler.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:09.800
I'm pretty amazing at it now,
but I want to get even better,

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.800
make my living out of it.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:25.500
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.500
and impose my own ideology,
even if they didn't want it!

00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.500
Easy for you to say. You're a king.

00:50:31.700 --> 00:50:35.700
Yes. And you are
only just a sad little head.

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:39.800
There must be something
you want to do before you die!

00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:43.800
- There is this one thing.
- What? Tell me.

00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:46.900
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.600
I never told Gloria
how I feel about her.

00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.500
What is it? Please tell me!

00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.300
I never had the guts
to tell Gloria how I feel about her.

00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.000
How I've always felt about her.

00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.900
Fine. Don't tell me!

00:51:00.100 --> 00:51:04.200
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.

00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:08.600
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.

00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:10.800
Yeah. Yeah.

00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:12.900
You're right.

00:51:12.900 --> 00:51:16.200
You've got to march
right up to this woman.

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:19.600
Look her right in the eye. Lean forward.

00:51:19.900 --> 00:51:22.400
Just a little, or almost all the way.

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.700
Then you let her lean forward
a little until you're...

00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:30.200
...just lips' distance
away from each other.

00:51:30.300 --> 00:51:33.900
Then you tell her how much you hate her.

00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.500
Actually, it's more like love her.

00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:41.400
Oh, you sly dog! Woof, woof!

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:45.100
You're a real player. Now listen to me.

00:51:45.400 --> 00:51:48.000
You got to rise up. You hearing me?

00:51:48.300 --> 00:51:49.700
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!

00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.800
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!

00:51:53.400 --> 00:51:56.400
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!

00:51:56.600 --> 00:51:58.500
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!

00:51:58.700 --> 00:52:01.500
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!

00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:03.400
Do you feel it?

00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:06.100
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!

00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:11.400
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:14.600
Yeah! I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.200
I love that happy little head.

00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:19.500
She love

00:52:19.700 --> 00:52:21.400
Moto Moto

00:52:22.100 --> 00:52:23.600
She love

00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.200
Moto Moto

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.800
She loves me
She loves my eyes

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.800
She loves me
She loves my thighs

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.000
She loves my roundness

00:52:35.300 --> 00:52:39.200
She love that I'm chunky
She love that I'm plumpy

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:43.300
She love my heftiness
She love my zestiness

00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:47.500
She love me restlessly
She love me forever

00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.500
She love me...

00:52:49.700 --> 00:52:51.300
...'cause she love me

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:52.800
Moto Moto...

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:56.500
...before things get too serious, well,

00:52:56.900 --> 00:53:00.800
I was wondering,
if I were to, for example, stay here...

00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:02.500
...l'd like to ask you...

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:07.200
Let your candied lips be
the messengers to my... ear canal.

00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.600
I have so many questions.

00:53:09.900 --> 00:53:13.300
I promise the answer will always be yes.

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:16.000
Unless no is required.

00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:20.400
So what is it about me
that you find so interesting?

00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:24.000
You're the most plumpenest girl
I've ever met.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
OK. Other than that.

00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:27.700
Let's see.

00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:30.800
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.

00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:33.100
Right.

00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:37.400
My gosh, girl, you huge.

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.700
You said that.

00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.900
Yeah, that's right.

00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:43.600
We don't have to talk no more.

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:45.000
Gloria!

00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:47.300
Gloria.

00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.700
Melman.

00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:54.600
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.

00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:59.700
Moto Moto. Yeah, nice to meet you.

00:54:00.100 --> 00:54:03.700
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.

00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.300
Apology accepted.

00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:10.100
Oh. Yeah, right, that.
That's why I... Good.

00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:13.600
OK. Well, that's it, then.

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:16.800
Good. We're kind of busy here, man.

00:54:17.100 --> 00:54:19.600
No. No, that's not it.

00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:24.100
Listen, Mototo, you better treat
this lady like a queen.

00:54:24.600 --> 00:54:27.900
Because you, my friend,
you found yourself the perfect woman.

00:54:28.200 --> 00:54:30.700
If I was ever so lucky
to find the perfect woman,

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.500
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers. OK?

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.600
Her favorites are orchids.
White. And breakfast in bed.

00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:41.000
Six loaves of wheat toast,
butter on both sides.

00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:42.700
No crust, the way she likes it.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.300
I'd be her shoulder to cry on
and her best friend.

00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:50.100
I'd spend every day thinking
of how to make her laugh.

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:53.800
She has the most amazing laugh.

00:54:57.100 --> 00:55:00.100
That's what I would do if I were you.

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.800
But I'm not, so you do it.

00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.800
OK.

00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.200
What?

00:55:08.800 --> 00:55:11.700
That was beautiful.

00:55:12.300 --> 00:55:15.200
Anyways, where were we?

00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.000
I'm "huge"?

00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:20.500
Surprised to see me, Makunga?

00:55:20.500 --> 00:55:23.800
Well, I'm here to set things straight,
like a real lion!

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:28.200
Is this real enough for you? How
about this? This is for setting me up!

00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:32.200
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!

00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:34.800
And making me look like a fool!

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:54.500
Had enough? Sure, fly away!

00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:56.200
Coward.

00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:09.700
The water. It's gone.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:11.900
It's never gone dry before.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.800
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?

00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:18.200
Out of my way! What is going on here?!

00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:21.100
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!

00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:23.500
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.

00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.100
Makunga, what do we do?

00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:26.600
Quiet!

00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:32.100
Listen up! I'm afraid there is only
one solution to this horrible crisis:

00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:34.800
We'll all have to fight for it.

00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:37.400
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.

00:56:38.900 --> 00:56:40.400
That's not fair. You'd win!

00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:41.900
Exactly, Shirley.

00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:43.100
I'm Bob...

00:56:43.600 --> 00:56:47.000
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now,

00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:50.200
thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:54.000
Please, Makunga, this is
the only water on the reserve.

00:56:54.100 --> 00:56:58.100
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look
for water off the reserve.

00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.700
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!

00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.200
Hunters would shoot us!

00:57:02.300 --> 00:57:04.200
No one leaves the reserve and survives!

00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:06.100
I left the reserve!

00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:08.300
And survived.

00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.500
I can do something about this.

00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:15.900
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we
get in New York. I'll travel upriver...

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.100
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?

00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:19.300
You?

00:57:20.300 --> 00:57:23.400
Yeah. I'll unclog the pipe
and bring back your water.

00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:28.600
Great! I'd help you pack, but by the
looks of that hat, I see you're all set!

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:34.300
Fine. Go ahead, laugh. Laugh
your mane off. I'll prove you wrong.

00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:37.500
Maybe you should try
a little rain dance.

00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.700
Zuba would know what to do.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.800
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.100
Zuba should be in charge, not you.

00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:55.400
All right, fine!

00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.100
As an added measure,
I will consult with Zuba!

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:07.000
Marty?

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.800
Hey! Marty!

00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:24.200
Marty?

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.600
Marty.

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:30.300
Where'd you get the fruity hat?

00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.900
Excuse me! Excuse me!

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.200
Hi. Is Marty in there?

00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.000
Anyone seen Marty?

00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.200
Which one of us is Marty?

00:58:43.700 --> 00:58:46.400
All right. Well, if you see him,

00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.900
tell him his friend Alex
came to say goodbye.

00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:51.700
Goodbye? Don't go. Where are you going?

00:58:51.800 --> 00:58:55.100
- Can we come?
- No. I have to do this alone.

00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.400
You can't leave the reserve!

00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.100
What are you doing?

00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.600
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!

00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:15.100
Could you leave the hat?

00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:16.800
Marty! I know you're in there.

00:59:17.900 --> 00:59:20.900
Before I go, I got something
I want to say.

00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:24.200
You've been a great friend.

00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.700
You've helped me so often
to see the bright side of my problems

00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:29.700
that I never think of you having any.

00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:33.600
I wasn't there for you
when you needed me.

00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:35.900
Just like back at the zoo.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:41.100
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.

00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:43.600
I just want you to know that I...

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.400
You're one in a million.

00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.800
This is touching.

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.300
It is touching.

00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:54.100
So could you turn around
so I can tell you to your face?

00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.800
That's right. Gotcha!

00:59:57.100 --> 00:59:59.700
I see you in there! Yeah, you.

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.700
You, right there.

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:06.000
Twelfth row, two hundred
and third from the left.

01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.500
That's you, Marty.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.600
I know it's you.

01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:13.500
Know what makes you special?

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:18.300
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:20.200
You're a dreamer, Marty.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:24.100
Always have been.
You have great taste in music

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:26.800
and horrible taste in friends.

01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:30.300
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.100
OK, I'm in.

01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:36.500
Marty, you can't come with me.

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.300
You don't have a choice.

01:00:43.200 --> 01:00:45.800
- People are out there!
- You're crazy! Come back!

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.800
The people will get you!

01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:50.200
Don't lose the hat!

01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:52.400
Bye, hat!

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:57.100
Any water?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.800
No, just more diamonds and gold.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:07.500
Don't give up hope.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:10.500
Listen up! I will help you!

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:13.700
There's only one way
to get your precious water.

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:17.000
I, your beloved King Julien

01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:22.200
must simply make a small sacrifice
to my good friends, the water gods,

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.400
in the volcano!

01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:30.000
What does that do?

01:01:30.300 --> 01:01:32.900
What does that do? Excellent question.

01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:36.300
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:40.400
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.900
"Thank you for the sacrifice."

01:01:42.900 --> 01:01:45.800
"Here, have another."
"No, I've had enough."

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:48.300
"I'll be insulted
unless you have another."

01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:50.800
"I don't want another sacrifice!"

01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.900
"Look at you! You're skinny!"
"No! I've had enough!"

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.500
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.

01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.400
They give me some water,
and then I give it to you.

01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:04.700
What?

01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.300
Does it work?

01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:09.100
No! I mean, yes.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.100
Well, Maurice?

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:13.700
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.

01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.600
We'll do it!

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.900
Excellent!

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.500
Now all I need is someone
who would like to go into the volcano

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:25.500
and get eaten by gods.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:28.800
Any hands! Hands, anybody!

01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:32.400
I need someone, perhaps
who has never found love,

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.700
who could look death straight
in the eyeball. A real, genuine hero.

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:39.800
- I'll do it.
- Melman?

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:52.900
Hurry up! Before we all
come to our senses!

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Melman, what is wrong with you?

01:02:56.300 --> 01:03:01.000
I'm dying anyway. If there's a chance
it'll get you water, it's worth it.

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:03.100
Are you nuts?

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.800
I want you to know, back at the zoo,

01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:09.200
it was never the doctors
or prescriptions that kept me going.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.600
It was always you.

01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:14.100
Seeing you every day.

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:16.300
That's what kept me going.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Melman! Wait!

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.700
Melman! Melman! Melman!

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.000
You going to mope like this all day?

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:35.300
Don't "hmph" me.

01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.300
Listen, Zuba. A miracle happened.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:44.200
Our son came back to us. How come
that is not good enough for you?

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:46.400
What are you saying, woman?

01:03:47.300 --> 01:03:51.500
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.

01:04:00.900 --> 01:04:02.200
Zuba!

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:04.800
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:06.800
What do you want?

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.000
It's awful.

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:10.400
The watering hole is dried up.

01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.400
Dried up? That's impossible!

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:15.400
There's nothing left!

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:19.200
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.500
Your son, Alakay, he said he
could fix it. He's gone upriver.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.200
- Off the reserve?!
- No!

01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:28.000
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.300
He was determined
to prove himself to you.

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:34.500
You stay here, in case he comes back!

01:04:37.100 --> 01:04:38.700
Hurry, Zuba!

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.700
I'm so parched.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:52.400
Is this place starting to freak you out?

01:04:52.500 --> 01:04:57.000
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.

01:04:57.100 --> 01:04:58.800
Why are we doing this?

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:02.400
Maybe my dad will think I'm...

01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:05.300
I want to show him I'm a real lion.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.500
As opposed to a chocolate lion.

01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:14.000
I know this may sound hard to believe,
but apparently, lions don't dance.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.300
What?!

01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:18.000
As far as my dad is concerned.

01:05:18.100 --> 01:05:20.700
As far as people are concerned,
you're a hit.

01:05:20.900 --> 01:05:24.100
In New York. This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.200
Marty, this is it!

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.800
This is the clog! Come on.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.900
Well, there's the water.

01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:43.600
Stay down. Look at that.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:46.300
Knit one, purl two.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.500
It's her.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.200
- Is this right?
- Very good.

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:51.200
Nana, slow down.

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.100
You're a little tangled, aren't you?

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.500
No, don't pull. I'll do it.

01:05:57.400 --> 01:05:58.900
We need dynamite. Got any?

01:05:59.100 --> 01:06:03.100
Oh, snap! I just used
my last stick this morning!

01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:07.100
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.800
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!

01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.600
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.300
No, no! Squiggly squid!

01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:16.700
Etch A Sketch!

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
That's too complex! Octopus, octopus!

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:25.500
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.600
Go get help! Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go! Go! Squiggly squid!

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.800
Etch A Sketch! Etch A Sketch!

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.100
Save us
We love you

01:06:37.200 --> 01:06:38.500
OK.

01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:41.500
OK, OK, OK.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.200
- Save us
- Melman

01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:52.000
- We love you
- Melman

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.100
Save us

01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.600
OK, here we go. OK, OK.

01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.700
- Melman
- We love you

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.300
- Melman
- Save us

01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.100
Here we go! Here we go!

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.100
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?

01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:07.900
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!

01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:11.600
So did I. Then I realized
I'm covered in brown spots.

01:07:11.900 --> 01:07:14.700
So Melman's not dying!

01:07:15.200 --> 01:07:17.900
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.200
Melman!

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:20.800
Move!

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.800
Don't do this! Julien,
stop this! This is crazy!

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:29.800
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe
into a volcano to make water is crazy!

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:30.800
Yes!

01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:37.400
- Please, Melman! Stop!
- Gloria?

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.500
- You can't do this!
- Why not?

01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.100
Because...

01:08:00.300 --> 01:08:02.000
You can't do this, Melman.

01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:03.900
First, that hurts.

01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:07.300
Second, I've only got
18 hours to live, anyway.

01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:09.900
Melman, I gotta know...

01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:13.600
...did you mean those things
you said about me?

01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.000
Of course I did.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:18.400
- That's crazy.
- It is?

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:25.100
It's crazy to think I had to go
halfway around the world...

01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:28.400
...to find out the perfect guy for me

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:30.400
lived right next door.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:33.800
Then it's you and me, neighbor.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.700
You and me for the next 18 hours.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.100
I'll take whatever you got.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.700
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.600
- What's going on here?
- Marty!

01:08:49.900 --> 01:08:53.600
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!

01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:56.100
- What about the plane?
- Perfect! Come on!

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:02.700
The plane won't be fixed
until the suits meet our demands.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.500
Now, maternity leave.

01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:08.000
Maternity leave? You're all males.

01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:10.600
We need that plane for a rescue mission.

01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:13.600
There's nothing I can do
until we bust up this union.

01:09:13.700 --> 01:09:17.100
I'll bust up all of you
if you don't get this plane going.

01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:21.500
Can't you see these commies have
my hands tied? No maternity leave.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want
these blowing around on the savanna.

01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.800
All right. You get your maternity leave.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:43.600
Finally.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.500
Where we headed?
What's going on? Where are we going?

01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:55.200
Oh, no! Please! Don't put me there! No!

01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:57.200
This is wrong.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:00.900
You see? You are survivors.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:04.700
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:06.700
You can't eat a lion.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.700
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.100
No, no, no. Don't listen to her.

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:14.100
She's out of her mind, people!

01:10:16.200 --> 01:10:17.900
I'm from New York City!

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:20.700
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!

01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:29.300
Dad!

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:34.400
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!

01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.300
Stay behind me.

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.500
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.100
Stay back!

01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:45.400
You'd let your dinner get away?

01:10:51.800 --> 01:10:55.100
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.400
What the heck?

01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.800
Hey, I know those moves.

01:11:08.200 --> 01:11:09.300
Alex?

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.000
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!

01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:16.800
It is Alex!

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:19.500
Only one lion can move like that!

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.200
He's beautiful.

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:27.400
I can't believe it.

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:36.300
How does he do that?

01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:50.400
What are you doing?

01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.400
I'm dancing with my son! I think.

01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:55.200
Don't think, Dad. Feel!

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:57.900
Butterfly!

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:02.400
I'm feeling it! I'm feeling it!

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:16.200
Roar!

01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.200
That was beautiful. Now let's eat!

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:30.800
Dad, look out!

01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:34.100
What the...

01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:35.900
Alex! Get in!

01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:39.700
She's got a gun! Get out while we can!

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.600
- What?
- She's got a gun!

01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:44.100
Get out while we can! Pass it on!

01:12:47.700 --> 01:12:52.200
He said let's have some fun
and take out the dam. Basset hound.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:55.600
Skipper! Alex wants to take out the dam.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.200
All right! But it's his funeral.

01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:02.100
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.900
Bring it on! Bring it on!

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:13.600
Come back! That's my dinner!

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.500
Kowalski, full throttle.

01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:19.100
Music!

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.700
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.

01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:26.800
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about! Bring her in low!

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:31.100
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!

01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:35.500
Hold on tight, baby! Here we go!

01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:39.300
Tell them no! Pull up! They'll kill us!

01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:42.500
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!

01:13:45.700 --> 01:13:50.000
They say no pull up. Kill us.
There's no other way. Basset hound.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.500
Are you sure?

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:56.300
Men, there is no sacrifice greater
than someone else's.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.000
No! Medic!

01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:03.800
Ramming speed!

01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:09.700
Bring it on!

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:13.800
Bad kitties.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:24.500
I don't know
why the sacrifice didn't work.

01:14:24.800 --> 01:14:27.200
The science seemed so solid.

01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:32.300
I'd jump right in that volcano
if I wasn't so good at whistling.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000
It's you! I found you!

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.300
Mort?

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.700
Bad fishy!

01:14:59.700 --> 01:15:01.600
I wonder if the gods like seafood.

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.500
Let's find out.

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.400
Look, Maurice.

01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:10.500
- That was quick.
- I did it!

01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:13.400
I did it! I did it!

01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:15.700
OK, you did it!

01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.700
Oh, yes!!

01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.800
Look!

01:15:45.400 --> 01:15:47.300
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.800
You did it!

01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.300
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.600
Zuba! Alakay!

01:16:01.200 --> 01:16:02.200
You're back!

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.000
I'm so glad you're safe!

01:16:06.900 --> 01:16:08.600
Out of my way.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.600
Well, well, well.

01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.100
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly,
you quit the pride.

01:16:17.500 --> 01:16:19.300
And you were kicked out.

01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:23.300
So don't think that this
changes anything.

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:28.400
You're right. In fact, we humbly present
you with this token of appreciation.

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:30.900
A man bag. Very popular where I'm from.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.300
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.600
Does the strap adjust? This will go
very nicely for me when I go out hiking.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:40.800
But you're still banished.

01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.800
We figured you'd say that.

01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.100
My handbag!

01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:49.400
You bad kitty!

01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:54.800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.400
You deserve this, son.

01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.700
Welcome to the pride.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.200
Thanks, Dad. But this belongs to you.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:21.000
No, son. To us!

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:30.400
My son! The King of New York!

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000
That's my baby!

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:44.400
Love transcends all differences.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.400
We are gathered here today
to celebrate such a love.

01:17:50.200 --> 01:17:53.500
Do you take each other,
for better or for worse?

01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:58.300
For better, please.

01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:02.200
What a beautiful, weird couple!

01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.400
That's not going to last.

01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:07.500
Can I kiss the bride?

01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:09.400
No! Music!

01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:11.200
- Struts.
- Check.

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.600
- Flaps!
- Check.

01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:14.600
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.

01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.700
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!

01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:20.000
See you later!

01:18:20.100 --> 01:18:23.000
We'll be back after the honeymoon
in Monte Carlo,

01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:24.900
or whenever the gold runs out.

01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:26.300
Come back soon!

01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:31.500
Mom, let them take their time. New York
isn't going anywhere, right, guys?

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.600
You're right about that!

01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.600
As long as I'm with her...

01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:39.500
...and you two, I don't care
where we are.

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:42.300
She has the most amazing laugh.

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.400
Love has no boundaries!

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.700
Looks like you're stuck
with us for a while.

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:56.200
Dad? What's wrong?

01:18:56.300 --> 01:18:58.900
I just thought we
could hang out a bit and...

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.500
- You got me!
- I got you, son!

01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.200
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:11.800
I got you, son!

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.700
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

01:19:14.800 --> 01:19:17.200
- Marty? Who's Marty?
- Come on.

01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:20.600
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.

01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:22.800
Ain't no Marty here.

01:19:22.900 --> 01:19:27.300
Marty! I can look into your eyes,
and I know it's you.

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:30.700
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

01:19:30.700 --> 01:19:34.000
But now that I found a home
feels like I'm in heaven

01:19:34.100 --> 01:19:37.300
See, I've been traveling
Been traveling forever

01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.300
But now that I'm home

01:19:39.300 --> 01:19:43.000
Hey! Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!

01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:46.700
Shake 'em! Shake 'em! Shake 'em!
