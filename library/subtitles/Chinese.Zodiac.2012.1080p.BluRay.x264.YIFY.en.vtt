01:03.480 --> 01:05.983
Hey, you cannot pass!

01:08.318 --> 01:10.412
Hi. I want to pee-pee.

01:10.487 --> 01:11.909
She's gorgeous!

01:11.989 --> 01:13.081
Please.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.037
Come. This way. Here.

01:15.117 --> 01:16.118
Thank you.

01:18.829 --> 01:20.581
What's going on?

01:20.664 --> 01:21.665
I don't get this.

01:21.748 --> 01:22.749
<i>Attention! Attention!</i>

01:22.833 --> 01:24.676
What's happening?

02:00.287 --> 02:02.790
There's a breach. Be alert!

02:02.873 --> 02:03.874
What is it?

02:04.499 --> 02:05.466
We're being attacked! Hurry!

02:05.542 --> 02:06.543
Get ready!

02:06.627 --> 02:07.628
What's going on?

02:17.638 --> 02:18.639
Stop him!

02:18.722 --> 02:20.770
- Stop him!
- Stop, or we will shoot!

02:20.849 --> 02:22.021
Get him!

02:25.687 --> 02:27.815
Get him!

02:27.898 --> 02:28.899
This way!

02:34.363 --> 02:35.910
He's under the truck! Get him!

02:37.032 --> 02:38.204
He's here!

02:43.163 --> 02:44.289
He's here!

02:55.550 --> 02:56.517
Get him!

02:56.593 --> 02:57.594
Shoot!

03:01.932 --> 03:03.024
Hurry!

03:03.850 --> 03:05.602
<i>There's a breach!
Don't let him get away!</i>

03:05.686 --> 03:06.687
Where are the keys?

03:49.271 --> 03:51.490
I can't see him. He's faster than a car!

03:59.406 --> 04:01.875
I can see our cars, but nothing else.

04:03.493 --> 04:06.497
Where is he? You haven't caught him?
What are you busy with'?

04:06.663 --> 04:07.915
What is this?

04:08.540 --> 04:09.632
Kill him!

04:20.385 --> 04:21.602
What's that?

04:36.985 --> 04:38.453
He's there!

05:15.899 --> 05:17.401
Oh, my poor backside!

05:45.136 --> 05:46.558
Shoot!

06:09.953 --> 06:11.580
JC, Okay?

06:13.415 --> 06:14.416
Go!

06:15.542 --> 06:16.668
<i>Take</i> her <i>up!</i>

06:19.504 --> 06:20.630
Hello?

06:20.922 --> 06:22.674
Hey, JC, it's Jonathan.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.010
<i>Did you find the Roses?</i>

06:25.093 --> 06:26.515
I'm on holiday!

06:26.720 --> 06:28.518
I have a new assignment. You interested?

06:28.597 --> 06:29.769
What's the pay?

06:29.890 --> 06:32.734
Twelve bronze heads from
the Old Summer Palace. You know them?

06:32.809 --> 06:34.061
Chinese zodiac?

06:46.406 --> 06:47.828
Going twice.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.247
Sold!

06:53.246 --> 06:54.714
Congratulations, Mr Morgan.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.087
MP is now the proud owner
of the world's four rarest stamps.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.794
You're wrong. Not four.

07:01.129 --> 07:04.554
Now there is only one in the world.

07:07.677 --> 07:09.645
Hey, check it out!
MP is all over the news today.

07:09.721 --> 07:11.018
The boss. He's back.

07:11.097 --> 07:13.600
It's the only one of its kind left.

07:13.683 --> 07:16.732
Its value goes triple overnight.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.779
- Father's idea.
- Genius!

07:18.855 --> 07:21.404
You want a priceless antique?
I'll make it for you.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.484
Next!

07:22.567 --> 07:25.286
The fifth bronze head did exceptionally well.
It was a surprise to us.

07:25.570 --> 07:29.120
Recent buyers, this auction season,
were all businessmen,

07:29.199 --> 07:31.122
who just love their country.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.546
That's because they'll do anything
for their own relics, won't they?

07:34.996 --> 07:37.624
Their patriotism equals our profit.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.792
Genius!

07:38.875 --> 07:40.377
These bronzes,

07:40.460 --> 07:42.883
each one higher than the last.

07:43.713 --> 07:48.310
<i>Yes, sir. In 2000, the Ox head
sold for more than 7 million.</i>

07:48.385 --> 07:49.637
Next item...

07:49.719 --> 07:53.064
<i>Same year,
the Monkey head goes for over 8 million.</i>

07:54.140 --> 07:56.563
<i>Tiger, over 15 million...</i>

07:56.768 --> 07:58.736
<i>And 6 for the Pig.</i>

07:58.937 --> 08:01.235
How am I getting my hands
on those bad boys?

08:01.481 --> 08:02.653
What about JC?

08:02.899 --> 08:04.993
He hasn't even found the <i>Roses</i> painting yet.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.321
<i>Roses?</i> Don't <i>worry</i> about <i>the Roses.</i>

08:07.988 --> 08:11.959
You tell JC
if he can get me all the remaining heads,

08:12.033 --> 08:13.910
there's a massive bonus in it for him.

08:13.994 --> 08:17.749
As long as the money is right,
JC will get you anything.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.836
Well, then, you tell him it's €1 million each.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.842
And if he gets us the dragon <i>as</i> well,
I'll add another zero.

08:24.921 --> 08:25.922
Genius!

08:28.133 --> 08:30.886
Professor Guan?
Martin's from National Geographic.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.221
This is Professor Guan.

08:32.470 --> 08:33.972
- Hi, Professor.
- How do you do?

08:34.055 --> 08:36.729
<i>National Geographic</i> is <i>very well-respected.</i>

08:37.809 --> 08:40.278
Our work needs
plenty of support from friends.

08:41.104 --> 08:45.405
Especially from credible and respected
media sources such as yours.

08:45.483 --> 08:48.077
I'm writing about
the 12 bronze heads right now.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.030
You are the expert.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.615
We want to learn from you.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.541
The Pyramids of Egypt,

08:53.616 --> 08:55.084
the Parthenon in Greece,

08:55.952 --> 08:57.750
and Cambodia's Angkor Wat,

08:57.829 --> 08:59.957
are just like China's Old Summer Palace.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.752
<i>The building of the Old Summer Palace
began in 1709.</i>

09:03.835 --> 09:06.258
<i>It took over 150 years.</i>

09:06.421 --> 09:08.765
<i>They say its magnificence stunned the world.</i>

09:09.132 --> 09:11.760
<i>Envoys called it "The Garden of Gardens".</i>

09:12.635 --> 09:15.309
<i>Haiyan Hall was its largest Western mansion.</i>

09:15.722 --> 09:18.145
<i>This is where
the 12 Chinese zodiac statues stood,</i>

09:18.808 --> 09:21.061
<i>each majestically spouting water at noon.</i>

09:21.728 --> 09:23.571
<i>In July, 1860,</i>

09:23.646 --> 09:25.944
<i>foreign armies breached Fort Dagu,</i>

09:26.024 --> 09:28.322
<i>and shattered the Empire's feeble defences.</i>

09:29.027 --> 09:30.370
<i>On October 6th,</i>

09:30.445 --> 09:33.415
<i>the invaders stormed
the Old Summer Palace.</i>

09:33.490 --> 09:37.836
<i>Many imperial treasures,
including the 12 bronze zodiac statues,</i>

09:37.911 --> 09:40.255
<i>were ruthlessly pillaged, or burned.</i>

09:40.830 --> 09:43.003
<i>The fire lasted three nights and days.</i>

09:43.625 --> 09:48.256
<i>This 150 year old architectural masterpiece
was razed to the ground.</i>

09:48.338 --> 09:49.931
Everybody!

09:50.006 --> 09:52.350
One, two, three!

09:56.638 --> 09:58.766
These students come from all over.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.896
They've been working here for years.

10:01.601 --> 10:04.195
Repatriating relics to their own countries.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.322
We need everyone to work hard.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.909
It takes centuries to create a miracle.

10:10.360 --> 10:13.830
<i>But a bomb or fire
can destroy it in an instant.</i>

10:14.072 --> 10:15.824
After much detailed research,

10:16.908 --> 10:20.082
we came up with almost
exact replicas of the statues.

10:21.204 --> 10:24.253
And you are the first reporter to see them.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.756
- No pictures!
- Oh.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.382
Sorry.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.798
Five have been auctioned. And the rest?

10:31.881 --> 10:34.304
There are many rumours
of their whereabouts.

10:35.218 --> 10:39.689
One of my students in Paris
is an expert on ancient antiquities.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.318
She recently examined
two of the auctioned heads.

10:43.893 --> 10:44.894
Which two?

10:45.436 --> 10:48.155
Rabbit head and the Rat head.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.276
How can I contact her?

10:52.443 --> 10:53.990
I'll contact her for you now.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.117
Thanks.

10:57.115 --> 10:58.992
- Can I touch?
- Of course.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.076
Thank you.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.383
Oh. Don't worry about doing that.

11:07.834 --> 11:09.836
But I should.

11:18.970 --> 11:19.971
It's here!

11:59.969 --> 12:02.563
The Rat head is finished. Is it very valuable?

12:02.639 --> 12:04.391
Depends on what you think is valuable.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.977
<i>For '£19, you can have them both.</i>

12:07.310 --> 12:08.937
This is your document.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.021
Welcome to Paris!

12:10.271 --> 12:11.488
Thank you.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.127
We are here for peace.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.336
Peace! Peace in your heart!

12:33.419 --> 12:34.420
Peace!

12:34.504 --> 12:35.926
Everybody! Okay?

12:36.005 --> 12:37.803
We will voice our concerns peacefully.

12:38.174 --> 12:39.892
Guan's student lives here?

12:39.968 --> 12:41.220
GPS says so.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.347
Wait here.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.146
Ooh! Paris!

12:49.185 --> 12:50.653
Are you Shangguan Ma-ding?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.230
Ah! Yes.

12:52.313 --> 12:53.781
But my research says

12:53.856 --> 12:56.109
that Shangguan Ma-ding
passed away several years ago.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.911
Ah, my cousin. I'm Martin Shangguan.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.204
Oh, really?

13:01.030 --> 13:02.282
Follow me.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.205
Everyone. Everyone.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.209
<i>This is Martin,
he's here from National Geographic.</i>

13:08.371 --> 13:11.921
He's here to do a feature
on the bronze heads that we examined.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.303
We need all the help we can get
from mainstream media,

13:15.378 --> 13:16.550
<i>like National Geographic.</i>

13:16.879 --> 13:18.222
I'll do my best.

13:18.840 --> 13:21.093
A common goal
among us young people who work here

13:21.217 --> 13:23.390
is to retrieve lost relics
from various countries.

13:24.053 --> 13:26.476
Of course, that includes the 12 bronze heads.

13:26.723 --> 13:27.940
Oh.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.901
So these must be the two bronze heads
that are here in France?

13:30.977 --> 13:33.230
Yes. They belong to Count Marceau now.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.487
I authenticated them,
and Professor Guan verified the data.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.533
They are authentic.

13:37.608 --> 13:39.281
Wow, he lives in that chéteau?

13:39.360 --> 13:40.782
Sorry.

13:40.862 --> 13:41.829
Job habit.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.952
Guys, guys! Here.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.287
What's going on?

13:45.700 --> 13:46.667
What's wrong, guys?

13:46.743 --> 13:49.337
- I was walking with Wu Qing...
- We were keeping surveillance on the cargo.

13:49.412 --> 13:50.379
No batteries. Stupid!

13:50.455 --> 13:51.923
Yeah, it's suspected
of being stolen antiques.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.171
Suddenly, out of nowhere,
all these guys started beating us up!

13:54.250 --> 13:57.174
That was too risky!
I've told you we only protest in peace.

13:57.253 --> 13:59.676
- And you, you should have stopped him.
- No, listen...

13:59.756 --> 14:01.099
No, no, no, guys. Listen to me.

14:01.174 --> 14:04.895
I'd like to remind all of you
about the principles of our organisation.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.264
<i>Producer of
the National Geographic channel.</i>

14:08.431 --> 14:09.432
- Reporter?
- Yes.

14:09.515 --> 14:10.516
- Chinese?
- Yes.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.193
You must help us expose MP's crime.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.269
Make them look bad!

14:13.770 --> 14:16.364
- I took photos. Take a look, here.
- Sit down!

14:16.439 --> 14:17.611
Be careful.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.947
I'm sorry this happened on your first visit.

14:20.026 --> 14:22.120
Anyway, we got
nothing else for you. Goodbye.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.035
- Uh, can I have a word?
- Of course.

14:26.366 --> 14:27.959
Come. Come over here.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.374
What's the matter?

14:30.453 --> 14:34.879
These people, and big companies,
you and your students must be...

14:34.957 --> 14:37.255
Very good. Nothing. Bye-bye.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.461
What was that about?

14:38.920 --> 14:40.263
- He'll crack the code.
- Okay.

14:40.338 --> 14:41.965
By then, I may be here.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.474
You will be my escape.

14:44.133 --> 14:47.478
The ground is flat,
and there's only one lower area.

14:47.553 --> 14:48.975
So pick me up there.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.444
Follow me.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.427
Monsieur Pierre, during
our phone conversation,

15:23.506 --> 15:26.225
<i>you said you wanted more information
about our bronze heads.</i>

15:26.342 --> 15:28.060
<i>We've brought you this portfolio.</i>

15:28.136 --> 15:30.434
I'm sure you'll find everything inside of it.

15:30.513 --> 15:33.266
I'm begging you to pick up the phone,
I'm begging you.

15:34.517 --> 15:37.771
- Are you certain about their authenticity?
- Yes, of course.

15:38.104 --> 15:40.402
Indeed, there are many replicas
on the market now.

15:40.481 --> 15:42.779
And even experienced collectors
have been fooled.

15:43.234 --> 15:45.657
But if you have any doubts,
you're free to get them tested.

15:45.736 --> 15:46.953
Okay, let me keep this book.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.157
<i>- And I will contact you soon.</i>
- Call <i>me</i> back.

15:51.534 --> 15:55.164
Count Marceau has used his hands
to flip through the album.

15:56.122 --> 15:58.591
I believe he's going to
the secret room right now.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.923
<i>Their surveillance systems
are installed outside.</i>

16:01.002 --> 16:02.720
<i>Maybe they're afraid of damaging the relics.</i>

16:03.129 --> 16:04.381
<i>Our research was correct.</i>

16:04.755 --> 16:06.632
<i>The owner is obsessed with tidiness.</i>

16:06.716 --> 16:08.389
<i>He's mysophobic just like you.</i>

16:08.718 --> 16:10.061
<i>So now, we wait.</i>

16:10.136 --> 16:11.183
Let's wait.

16:16.058 --> 16:17.810
Mmm. They're all seeing their boss off.

16:18.060 --> 16:19.061
I see.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.940
Tell me when you're ready!

16:25.067 --> 16:26.068
We're ready!

16:32.742 --> 16:33.834
Five seconds.

17:15.910 --> 17:16.911
I see them.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.376
Hurry up.
Looks like they're coming back to you.

17:29.215 --> 17:30.762
Found it. The bookshelf.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.915
Hmm. Same old trick.

18:00.663 --> 18:01.630
Oh, no.

18:01.706 --> 18:02.958
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?

18:03.040 --> 18:05.714
Three sets of 46-letter combinations.

18:06.168 --> 18:08.216
Even with eight computers,
it'll take two days.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.285
Weird!

18:31.360 --> 18:33.158
What has the boss been up to?

18:35.197 --> 18:36.369
Hmm?

18:40.411 --> 18:44.041
<i>JC". Why would a person so tidy
misplace his books?</i>

18:47.543 --> 18:48.544
"14 "

18:51.213 --> 18:53.557
<i>should be put</i>

18:54.383 --> 18:55.555
<i>over there.</i>

18:57.428 --> 18:58.554
<i>Three...</i>

19:00.681 --> 19:04.151
<i>Ah! That's how he remembers the password.</i>

19:14.612 --> 19:16.410
I know how to open it.

19:25.581 --> 19:31.588
<i>A, 4, HI, V, 1966,</i>

19:31.962 --> 19:35.592
<i>A, 1982, XI...</i>

19:39.512 --> 19:40.934
Voilà! Genius me!

19:52.441 --> 19:53.533
You found them yet?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.321
No rush.

20:06.997 --> 20:08.123
Rat head.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.510
Rabbit head.

20:12.712 --> 20:13.964
They look like our replicas?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.515
To me, they look the same.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.935
Is there anything else worth taking?

20:27.184 --> 20:28.276
All junk!

20:31.439 --> 20:32.736
You know what I see?

20:32.815 --> 20:33.816
- What?
- What?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.535
Pharaoh's sceptre, Czarina's staff.

20:36.610 --> 20:37.736
Golden Eagle Box,

20:37.987 --> 20:39.284
Star of Arabia!

20:39.572 --> 20:41.370
Those are all lost national relics!

20:41.657 --> 20:44.001
And now, they belong to us.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.333
Yeah!

21:03.429 --> 21:04.646
Guess what else I found?

21:05.014 --> 21:06.106
- What?
- What?

21:07.808 --> 21:09.856
A painting we dreamt of stealing.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.272
<i>Did</i> you <i>say the Roses?</i>

21:12.646 --> 21:13.647
You got it!

21:23.616 --> 21:26.415
Been looking for you, and here you are.

21:27.161 --> 21:28.663
<i>Lucky son of a gun.</i>

21:28.788 --> 21:32.088
Just look at this photo.

21:33.709 --> 21:34.835
Who are you?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.716
Who are you?

21:36.879 --> 21:38.677
What are you doing?

21:38.756 --> 21:39.848
Guards!

21:39.965 --> 21:41.467
Hey! Stop!

21:43.052 --> 21:44.099
Hey, guys!

21:44.887 --> 21:46.389
He's upstairs! Go get him!

21:46.514 --> 21:47.686
They saw me!

21:50.893 --> 21:52.065
What's going on?

21:55.481 --> 21:57.154
Inside chased by dogs!

21:57.233 --> 21:58.530
Need directions!

22:05.699 --> 22:06.871
There he is!

22:22.758 --> 22:25.181
Look! He's on the roof!

22:25.261 --> 22:26.387
Go get him!

22:26.470 --> 22:27.687
Go that way.

22:48.117 --> 22:49.915
Bet you can't do that!

22:49.994 --> 22:51.462
More dogs!

23:06.594 --> 23:09.723
Outside the castle. Southeast. Which way?

23:14.059 --> 23:15.652
There's a maze ahead of you. Don't go in!

23:17.938 --> 23:19.656
I think I'm already in it.

23:19.773 --> 23:20.865
Can you fly out?

23:20.941 --> 23:21.988
No room for a take-off.

23:22.318 --> 23:23.365
I got to try, anyway-

23:27.990 --> 23:30.709
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,
that's the way I got to go!

23:32.536 --> 23:34.163
Come on, there's no time for rhymes.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.838
Just find me an exit!

23:38.167 --> 23:40.010
<i>We can't see you
until you're airborne!</i>

24:02.566 --> 24:03.909
Why are they stopping?

24:06.320 --> 24:07.947
Are they short-sighted?

24:20.709 --> 24:21.881
Look, he's airborne!

24:26.507 --> 24:27.633
He's down again.

24:27.716 --> 24:28.888
It's too short!

24:35.724 --> 24:36.896
Dead end!

24:50.906 --> 24:52.908
- What are you doing?
- I'm acting like a dog!

25:13.012 --> 25:14.013
Bite me?

25:15.264 --> 25:16.265
Lie down!

25:16.932 --> 25:18.024
Good!

25:18.517 --> 25:19.609
Be good.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.270
Stay put!

25:21.645 --> 25:22.692
Good dog.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.072
Go!

25:25.816 --> 25:27.944
You spoke English to a French dog?

25:28.819 --> 25:30.742
Surprised he could understand.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.549
Thanks I'll call you later.

25:49.631 --> 25:50.598
Okay-

25:50.674 --> 25:52.176
Guards.

25:52.259 --> 25:53.260
Go check it out right now!

25:59.641 --> 26:01.143
Finally, lam out!

26:01.393 --> 26:03.236
Simon will handle the rest. You call him.

26:03.312 --> 26:05.690
He doesn't like talking to me.
You better call him.

26:18.035 --> 26:19.082
Martin?

26:24.333 --> 26:25.459
Martin!

26:26.710 --> 26:27.757
What are you doing?

26:27.836 --> 26:28.883
Don't know you!

26:29.171 --> 26:30.514
Was that you in the chéteau just now?

26:31.131 --> 26:32.804
Coco, it wasn't me.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.348
Someone else? Impossible!

26:35.803 --> 26:37.805
- It was you!
- Hey, hey! Watch out!

26:43.560 --> 26:46.404
- It was you!
- Hey, let go! Don't grab me! Let go!

26:47.147 --> 26:48.319
How could you steal?

26:48.398 --> 26:49.775
What you're talking about?

26:49.858 --> 26:51.485
We've been had! They knew each other!

26:51.568 --> 26:52.569
Shit!

26:52.653 --> 26:53.700
GO, go:

26:53.779 --> 26:55.998
Let go of me! Keep your eyes on the road!

26:56.073 --> 26:58.041
- Are you still denying it?
- Fine, fine, it was me!

26:58.242 --> 26:59.289
Why did you do that?

26:59.368 --> 27:01.211
It's hard to explain right now.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.211
Watch out!

27:16.176 --> 27:18.019
- Are you okay?
- Meet you at the boat!

27:25.811 --> 27:28.735
<i>Simon. Your 6 o'clock,
9 o'clock above!</i>

27:51.879 --> 27:53.005
Perfect!

27:55.090 --> 27:56.262
- Where is the other?
- Coco's got it.

28:02.222 --> 28:04.224
You're no reporter. Who are you really?

28:05.100 --> 28:06.693
I have two identities.

28:06.894 --> 28:09.568
I am president of a non-profit.

28:09.646 --> 28:13.196
International Foundation
of Relics, Medals and Paintings.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.243
What's that? I've never heard of that before.

28:15.319 --> 28:17.367
You know every organisation in the world?

28:17.487 --> 28:18.864
What about the head?

28:19.114 --> 28:21.583
- Give it back to the Chinese government.
- Okay!

28:25.120 --> 28:26.963
Be careful, guys. Let's go!

28:27.039 --> 28:29.383
It's here! Let's go!

28:29.458 --> 28:31.210
Go, go! Let's go!

28:36.840 --> 28:37.887
Hello.

28:45.140 --> 28:47.017
Oh, no. Not this.

28:47.309 --> 28:48.777
Hello, is this the police?

29:02.741 --> 29:04.414
This is the one I authenticated.

29:11.083 --> 29:13.256
- What's going on?
- Stay here!

29:15.545 --> 29:16.888
My power cable!

29:29.518 --> 29:31.316
Police! Don't move!

29:32.354 --> 29:33.776
Police! Police! Don't move!

29:38.402 --> 29:40.404
I swear that they are accomplices!

29:40.487 --> 29:41.613
It's not true!

29:41.863 --> 29:43.581
The Marceau family's reputation
is impeccable...

29:43.657 --> 29:45.751
Had an impeccable reputation.

29:45.909 --> 29:49.959
We've watched these tapes,
and we saw nothing.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.461
There are customs documents,

29:52.541 --> 29:55.511
and a witness
who saw nothing at the chéteau.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.638
She was estranged
after her uncle rejected a loan request.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.843
No, I was three when I last visited him.
Do you really think I'd remember?

30:01.925 --> 30:03.393
- I swear to God that...
- Shut up!

30:05.178 --> 30:07.977
We will keep the statue for two weeks.

30:08.056 --> 30:10.684
If no one claims it, you can have it back.

30:11.101 --> 30:14.776
If they bother you again, let us know.

30:14.855 --> 30:16.573
- Now, you're free to go.
- Thank you.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.366
- But that's not true!
- Shut up!

30:18.442 --> 30:19.534
I swear they stole the heads!

30:19.609 --> 30:21.862
You've other things to worry about!

30:22.029 --> 30:23.372
Hey, how did it go?

30:23.447 --> 30:24.915
Yeah, it went well.

30:25.615 --> 30:28.084
- Hello!
- And now that we have... Oh.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.372
I still want to thank
this honest and beautiful citizen of France.

30:31.455 --> 30:33.628
You're welcome. All I did was tell the truth.

30:33.874 --> 30:34.921
My name is Catherine.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.386
You seem very interested
in those bronze heads.

30:38.462 --> 30:40.931
I have something at my house
you might be interested in.

30:41.340 --> 30:42.341
Well, think about it.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.183
Drive on, Bruno.

30:44.259 --> 30:45.932
- Chéteau Sichel.
- Bye!

30:46.178 --> 30:48.021
I've always wanted to see it!

30:49.056 --> 30:50.729
Welcome! I'm sorry.

30:50.807 --> 30:52.855
There are some routine
security measures here.

30:52.934 --> 30:55.153
The bank has taken possession
of everything.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.818
Nothing of value is permitted to be taken out.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.946
It's okay. Beautiful castle.

31:00.025 --> 31:01.402
Please, follow me.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.117
Let's go.

31:09.618 --> 31:13.213
Because our family went bankrupt
in a financial crisis.

31:13.288 --> 31:16.007
Well, still nice to be able to live here.

31:16.083 --> 31:17.175
Thank you.

31:18.627 --> 31:20.629
Your ancestors may have been

31:20.712 --> 31:23.340
the last people to see
these beautiful creatures.

31:23.924 --> 31:25.642
Yes, I know what you mean.

31:26.176 --> 31:29.646
Things are only treasured by people
after they have disappeared.

31:30.305 --> 31:32.182
Yeah, you are right!

31:36.144 --> 31:37.191
Rooster?

31:37.646 --> 31:39.489
It's the reason I invited you here.

31:39.648 --> 31:40.649
Is that real?

31:41.149 --> 31:42.867
It's been here since I was born.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.071
This is stolen property, right?

31:46.488 --> 31:47.535
What did she say?

31:48.323 --> 31:50.542
Uh, she said, "Beautiful staircase."

31:50.951 --> 31:52.248
Oh, thank you.

31:53.412 --> 31:54.459
Let's go.

31:56.456 --> 31:58.754
This is my great-great grandfather.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.176
Her grandfather.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.171
Years ago, he came back from overseas.

32:03.588 --> 32:07.968
Later, his son, my grandma's father,
put together an expedition

32:08.051 --> 32:10.600
<i>and went to sea 'm search of the ship,
Indestructible.</i>

32:10.720 --> 32:14.065
But he never returned.
He just disappeared mysteriously.

32:14.141 --> 32:16.690
I've heard you have the animals' heads.

32:17.394 --> 32:21.024
Maybe you would have clues
about my great grandfather?

32:23.733 --> 32:25.110
This is stolen property, right?

32:25.193 --> 32:27.321
The value of what they've stolen
is over a billion dollars!

32:27.571 --> 32:30.791
If you'd installed an infrared security system,
things would have been much better.

32:30.866 --> 32:31.913
So it's my fault, then?

32:31.992 --> 32:33.460
No, no, no...

32:33.535 --> 32:34.536
I'll make you a promise.

32:34.619 --> 32:37.873
If you don't recover that painting,
I will have you killed!

32:44.671 --> 32:47.641
Oh, it's a rocking horse I had
when I was a child.

32:48.842 --> 32:53.848
Oh. And my great-great grandfather had these
painted after his return from overseas.

32:54.389 --> 32:58.235
It's the view he saw
after his ship was damaged.

32:58.685 --> 33:01.438
Why don't you have a look around?
I'll go get some tea.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.522
Thank you.

33:06.193 --> 33:07.240
Go, go, go!

33:07.736 --> 33:09.659
Okay. How can we steal it?

33:09.738 --> 33:12.662
It's best if we stay two days, steal it and go.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.168
Can't. We'll need a replica.

33:15.577 --> 33:16.669
But we need data.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.167
Professor Guan has that.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.293
Ask Coco.

33:20.832 --> 33:24.132
Don't use the word "steal" with her,
or she won't help us.

33:24.211 --> 33:25.929
What do you want to do?

33:26.755 --> 33:27.927
Look, guys!

33:28.882 --> 33:31.101
It's Castiglione's Emperor Qianlong's
<i>Autumn Hunt!</i>

33:31.176 --> 33:32.803
Is it valuable?
All antiquities are valuable.

33:32.886 --> 33:34.559
So my grandpa's chamber
pot is priceless?

33:34.638 --> 33:36.140
So this painting does exist.

33:36.223 --> 33:37.770
Wasn't it destroyed already?

33:38.850 --> 33:43.321
In 1860,
my great-great grandfather sailed to China

33:43.396 --> 33:46.775
on the ship called Indestructible,
and won a great victory.

33:47.317 --> 33:49.411
This was one of the spoils of war
he brought back.

33:50.612 --> 33:51.613
What are you doing?

33:51.696 --> 33:53.539
I'm taking it back to China!

33:53.782 --> 33:56.626
This is my home.
You can't just take anything you want!

33:56.868 --> 33:58.290
Just like over 100 years ago.

33:59.287 --> 34:02.131
It's not like your ancestor
asked anyone before taking this painting.

34:02.791 --> 34:03.792
Coco.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.919
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa!

34:07.796 --> 34:08.797
Coco.

34:09.464 --> 34:11.387
These things happened so long ago.

34:11.591 --> 34:14.435
Back then, if a woman wore too little clothes,

34:14.553 --> 34:16.726
someone might throw a stone at you.

34:16.805 --> 34:18.307
No, her.

34:19.641 --> 34:20.688
Sorry.

34:20.934 --> 34:22.231
Sorry for what?

34:22.310 --> 34:23.607
Don't be a bleeding heart.

34:23.687 --> 34:25.405
She should be the one apologising.

34:25.647 --> 34:26.648
What did she say?

34:27.399 --> 34:28.651
Did she say something?

34:29.401 --> 34:30.869
I don't need you to translate.

34:31.695 --> 34:32.912
Did you all forget?

34:33.655 --> 34:39.082
They came to our country a century ago,
burnt, raped, murdered and pillaged.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.629
It's you who should apologise.

34:41.705 --> 34:46.552
Over a century ago, your ancestors came
to our country to rape, pillage and murder.

34:46.835 --> 34:50.965
Even 100 years later,
these memories still hurt the Chinese.

34:54.301 --> 34:55.518
It's true.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.769
I studied history. Whatever the excuses...

35:00.307 --> 35:01.559
I studied history.

35:01.725 --> 35:03.523
Whatever the excuses used,

35:04.019 --> 35:06.488
these things did indeed happen.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.782
Sorry.

35:10.692 --> 35:13.320
But at the end of the day,
all of these now belong to the bank.

35:13.403 --> 35:14.495
This is worthless to me.

35:14.571 --> 35:15.572
I would give it to you.

35:16.698 --> 35:18.575
Yeah, Coco, let's have some tea first.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.752
I'm going outside, I need some air.

35:20.827 --> 35:21.874
Coco...

35:23.705 --> 35:25.332
- What is it?
- Look at this.

35:30.420 --> 35:31.421
Sorry, sorry. I forgot something.

35:31.504 --> 35:32.596
- Catherine!
- Yes?

35:32.672 --> 35:35.095
- Your one great grandfather's ship?
- Yes?

35:35.175 --> 35:36.973
Did it sink, or was it grounded?

35:37.469 --> 35:38.516
Who knows?

35:39.137 --> 35:42.232
You know what?
We're getting very interested

35:42.557 --> 35:44.855
about finding your
one great grandfather back.

35:45.477 --> 35:47.070
If we stay another couple of days,

35:47.270 --> 35:50.444
get an investigation, more information,
we might be able to help.

35:50.523 --> 35:51.866
Thank you! Thank you so much!
It's wonderful.

35:51.941 --> 35:53.158
We have plenty of rooms here.

35:53.234 --> 35:55.737
<i>You can stay as long as you</i> wish.
<i>I'm going</i> to <i>make the preparations.</i>

35:55.820 --> 35:57.413
But not alive.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.656
It's okay.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.076
Coco.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.250
Thank you. I'll call you later.

36:04.412 --> 36:05.413
Thanks again.

36:05.497 --> 36:06.544
Thank you.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.921
Let's stay longer and steal the Rooster head.
Come on.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.047
No stealing.

36:10.126 --> 36:12.003
We're guests here. We mustn't do that.

36:12.087 --> 36:13.384
Who <i>says</i> we can't?

36:14.172 --> 36:15.970
They stole it from us first.

36:16.049 --> 36:18.893
If we take it, we're retrieving it, not stealing.

36:19.302 --> 36:20.303
A good point!

36:20.387 --> 36:23.516
We need to make a replica, see?
But we don't have the data.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.519
Professor Guan has it! I'll ask him.

36:27.602 --> 36:28.774
- Good!
- Quick!

36:47.455 --> 36:48.798
- Here!
- Data?

36:55.296 --> 36:56.468
Hello.

36:57.799 --> 36:58.800
Thank you.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.054
I have to go pee-pee.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.140
- This way, Madame.
- Thank you!

37:21.239 --> 37:22.707
Hi!

37:23.867 --> 37:25.585
- Have some cake!
- Have a balloon!

37:25.660 --> 37:26.786
Bye!

37:33.835 --> 37:34.882
Genius!

38:04.699 --> 38:07.623
What are these fools doing here,
huh? Lunch picnic?

38:08.787 --> 38:10.915
They're now our lunch.

38:27.388 --> 38:31.734
Mom and dad, can we go on vacation?

38:35.939 --> 38:36.940
Look!

38:37.690 --> 38:39.567
This is what we picked up from before.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.044
What do you think?

39:03.591 --> 39:05.013
Eh! Ho!

39:06.135 --> 39:07.728
No wonder it's not on the map.

39:08.596 --> 39:09.768
Bingo!

39:10.098 --> 39:11.941
He was here when he drew this painting.

39:12.016 --> 39:13.643
You guys are amazing!

39:13.726 --> 39:15.069
No, technology is.

39:15.144 --> 39:16.737
So then what should we do next?

39:16.813 --> 39:17.985
We'll camp down there.

39:19.190 --> 39:21.158
I won't talk to your voice-mail.

39:21.860 --> 39:24.659
Martin, the news said
those three heads were auctioned.

39:24.737 --> 39:26.580
Huh? Impossible!

39:26.656 --> 39:28.158
What do you mean? I'll show you.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.617
No signal.

39:29.993 --> 39:31.085
They must be fakes!

39:31.160 --> 39:33.504
We're keeping the real ones safe. All right?

39:33.955 --> 39:36.253
So you're saying that fakes
could fetch a fortune?

39:36.708 --> 39:37.709
What about the real ones?

39:37.792 --> 39:38.918
They're priceless!

39:39.294 --> 39:41.137
- But now...
- Now, let me advise you.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.429
Don't change with the lights on.

39:42.505 --> 39:44.132
- Why not?
- See that?

39:44.215 --> 39:46.343
- So I...
- We don't look.

39:47.552 --> 39:48.644
Honest!

39:49.512 --> 39:50.764
Seriously, we didn't see anything.

39:50.847 --> 39:52.815
Don't turn on the satellite receiver.

39:54.559 --> 39:55.606
Here.

39:55.977 --> 39:57.194
What's with you two?

39:57.270 --> 39:58.317
Still a standoff.

39:58.521 --> 40:01.115
If it weren't for my little girl,
I'd left him long ago.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.575
Hey, what about you?

40:02.650 --> 40:03.697
Not answering.

40:03.776 --> 40:06.746
Her birthday was three days ago.
We still can celebrate.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.073
Why is she so mad?

40:08.615 --> 40:10.162
You know how hard I'd been trying?

40:10.617 --> 40:13.086
And you? You sure you won't reconsider?

40:13.161 --> 40:16.506
With her temper? It's intolerable.
It's whoever leaves first.

40:17.790 --> 40:21.169
I don't get who came up with
Valentine's Day and all those holidays.

40:21.294 --> 40:23.046
Does it matter
whose idea they were?

40:23.171 --> 40:25.173
What's most important is that
you were there when she needs you.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.554
If I'm home every day, who'll earn money?

40:27.634 --> 40:29.261
You men just don't understand women!

40:31.220 --> 40:32.267
There!

40:34.098 --> 40:35.145
It's Coco.

40:35.850 --> 40:37.318
- I told them to stay put.
- JC!

40:37.393 --> 40:38.485
Catherine!

40:38.978 --> 40:41.982
- Coming! We're coming!
- Help us!

40:42.065 --> 40:43.112
Hold on!

40:43.191 --> 40:44.613
- Don't move!
- Help us!

40:44.692 --> 40:45.739
I told you to stay put!

40:47.695 --> 40:48.787
Hold on!

40:54.118 --> 40:55.370
JC!

41:05.964 --> 41:07.056
JC?

41:07.215 --> 41:08.262
<i>We got trouble!</i>

41:09.008 --> 41:09.975
What happened? What's wrong?

41:10.051 --> 41:11.143
They fell down a hole!

41:12.261 --> 41:14.309
Didn't I tell you to stay put!

41:15.098 --> 41:16.145
It's her fault!

41:16.224 --> 41:18.727
Say something I understand in English!

41:19.060 --> 41:20.186
Purple

41:21.270 --> 41:22.567
panties!

41:32.740 --> 41:35.584
Purple is my favourite colour!

41:36.244 --> 41:38.167
You came dressed for a picnic.

41:38.246 --> 41:40.920
Girls, we haven't landed yet!

41:41.082 --> 41:42.083
JC?

41:42.458 --> 41:43.505
Where's your hand?

41:45.003 --> 41:47.005
Under your purple.

41:47.088 --> 41:48.556
- Let go!
- You sure?

41:48.631 --> 41:49.632
Yeah, I'm sure!

41:49.924 --> 41:50.971
Okay-

42:11.779 --> 42:13.622
Madam, you're on the ground.

42:13.698 --> 42:14.824
JC!

42:14.907 --> 42:15.999
We're okay!

42:16.617 --> 42:17.960
But Coco's missing!

42:18.870 --> 42:20.417
JC's fine. Coco's missing.

42:22.165 --> 42:23.212
Send the coordinates.

42:26.919 --> 42:28.637
- This way.
- Yeah.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.812
Coco!

42:42.018 --> 42:43.235
Coco!

42:44.187 --> 42:45.734
I'm over here.

42:45.813 --> 42:46.860
I found Coco!

42:47.482 --> 42:49.450
Tell Captain to get the medicine box.

42:49.525 --> 42:50.697
Okay, got it!

42:52.153 --> 42:53.154
You all right?

42:53.404 --> 42:55.247
- My foot!
- Which foot?

42:57.450 --> 42:58.497
Don't move!

43:03.372 --> 43:04.965
- What? What's wrong?
- Nothing, nothing.

43:05.041 --> 43:06.133
Your foot!

43:06.292 --> 43:07.384
Shh!

43:07.835 --> 43:09.007
Uh, nothing, nothing.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.179
Snake!

43:18.012 --> 43:19.980
- Where?
- Okay.

43:20.056 --> 43:21.228
My foot.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.230
It just dislocated.

43:27.188 --> 43:28.280
Simon.

43:28.815 --> 43:29.862
Look at these trees!

43:31.067 --> 43:32.239
Cut down by loggers.

43:36.364 --> 43:38.366
I see cannons and cannonballs!

43:38.783 --> 43:41.411
This ship looks like it's from that era!

43:42.453 --> 43:45.127
Did we just stumble
upon the Indestructible?

43:45.581 --> 43:46.798
I think so.

43:48.459 --> 43:49.756
What have you got there?

43:50.211 --> 43:51.758
Check out this chain.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.215
What's it doing here?

43:55.550 --> 43:57.223
it goes all the way into that tree!

43:59.887 --> 44:01.685
<i>The Indestructible!</i>

44:01.764 --> 44:02.811
You've found it!

44:02.890 --> 44:04.437
No, we fell on it.

44:05.852 --> 44:06.899
No way!

44:06.978 --> 44:08.275
No, it's for real!

44:12.692 --> 44:15.866
Ah, it's okay. It's just a tarantula.

44:22.743 --> 44:23.790
- JC!
"Huh?

44:24.745 --> 44:26.042
I found my great grandfather!

44:26.706 --> 44:27.798
What?

44:27.957 --> 44:29.834
You can tell from the bones?

44:29.917 --> 44:32.591
No, no. This ring.
It's my family's crest. I found it here.

44:34.714 --> 44:36.091
There are two! Which one?

44:36.257 --> 44:37.304
Instinct!

44:37.550 --> 44:38.597
- Quick.
- This one!

44:39.760 --> 44:41.353
- Good!
- Are you sure?

44:41.429 --> 44:43.022
Sure. That's what you said.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.974
I'll stuff your great grandfather
in my backpack.

44:45.057 --> 44:46.559
His arm.
Oops. Sorry!

45:08.873 --> 45:10.716
JC!

45:11.417 --> 45:12.634
We found it!

45:16.464 --> 45:19.183
Who could've imagined?
And in a place like this!

45:19.300 --> 45:20.426
How did you find it?

45:20.801 --> 45:21.768
Amazing!

45:21.844 --> 45:24.518
We stumbled on it. And broke her foot.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.725
Bonnie, I have the medical kit!

45:28.059 --> 45:31.563
Go around! There's a known path!
Just follow the marks we left!

45:31.938 --> 45:33.485
Okay, on my Way!

45:33.731 --> 45:36.109
<i>- This is the Indestructible?
- Yeah.</i>

45:36.484 --> 45:37.656
How did it end up here?

45:38.361 --> 45:40.409
- Typhoon?
- Are typhoons that powerful?

45:40.529 --> 45:41.951
- Tsunami?
- Possibly.

45:42.156 --> 45:45.251
On our way here,
we come across graves and a few skeletons.

45:46.285 --> 45:48.913
The ones outside must belong
to the ship's crew.

45:49.497 --> 45:52.467
But judging from the decomposition
of those inside,

45:52.833 --> 45:54.380
they're different from the others.

45:54.835 --> 45:56.382
Some of them were stabbed as well.

45:57.213 --> 45:59.307
They must have fought before they died.

45:59.715 --> 46:02.434
Probably men who came
with her great grandfather.

46:02.510 --> 46:04.103
They didn't die from natural causes.

46:04.887 --> 46:07.265
I think they killed each other.

46:08.266 --> 46:09.438
They killed each other?

46:09.517 --> 46:13.488
So his son came back to look
for the spoils of war his father left behind?

46:14.021 --> 46:15.147
Is that right?

46:15.898 --> 46:17.241
- Correct?
- Right.

46:17.441 --> 46:18.488
We need to take a leak!

46:18.567 --> 46:19.739
- Right.
- Right.

46:20.569 --> 46:21.570
Where are you going?

46:21.654 --> 46:23.247
Bathroom!
All of you?

46:23.322 --> 46:24.448
- Yeah !
- Pee-pee.

46:26.117 --> 46:28.620
Hey, it goes downhill.

46:29.287 --> 46:33.042
And the path is lined with logs.
No wonder they cut so many trees.

46:33.374 --> 46:35.752
Hey! Don't do that! Hey, there's more.

46:35.835 --> 46:37.633
Hey, look up there!

46:38.087 --> 46:39.464
That's a huge anchor!

46:39.630 --> 46:41.724
Weird. Why's it hung up there?

46:43.301 --> 46:45.349
It's a clever lever device.

46:48.055 --> 46:51.059
As the anchor descends,
the chain rod will ascend,

46:51.142 --> 46:54.237
and it sends the trunk downhill
via the pulley.

46:55.313 --> 46:58.112
No wonder I couldn't find
a single pulley on the ship.

46:58.190 --> 47:02.411
This is how we benefit
from our ancestors' wisdom!

47:02.862 --> 47:03.988
You don't seem excited.

47:04.905 --> 47:08.000
I'm thinking about
how to take this trunk back with us.

47:09.243 --> 47:10.916
If it's really filled with...

47:10.995 --> 47:12.087
It's not an "if".

47:15.541 --> 47:17.839
Money! Money! Money!

47:17.918 --> 47:19.716
JC, the medical kit.

47:20.338 --> 47:21.555
And your friend is here.

47:21.630 --> 47:23.428
Hey. JC!

47:23.507 --> 47:26.101
I'm very happy to see you again.

47:26.594 --> 47:29.939
My friend, it's a big surprise.

47:34.852 --> 47:36.274
Pierre?

47:36.354 --> 47:37.571
Catherine.

47:37.772 --> 47:39.615
Address me as "miss".
You're ridiculous!

47:39.690 --> 47:40.691
Shut up!

47:40.775 --> 47:42.573
You're not in our castle an more.
<i>Y</i>

47:42.651 --> 47:43.652
Okay-

47:43.778 --> 47:45.951
I knew you were working together.

47:46.030 --> 47:48.954
Give me the painting
and all the things you stole.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.456
You think I would bring
everything to this island?

47:51.786 --> 47:53.003
Ready!

47:53.079 --> 47:54.205
Pierre!

47:58.125 --> 47:59.126
You Okay?

47:59.502 --> 48:01.880
Idiots!
I told you not to load the guns!

48:01.962 --> 48:02.963
Don't move!

48:03.047 --> 48:04.674
Or I'll blow your heads off!

48:04.757 --> 48:06.225
We've been watching you.

48:06.300 --> 48:07.426
- They pirates?
- Yup!

48:07.510 --> 48:08.511
Must be.

48:08.594 --> 48:12.474
If you don't do what I say, I'll kill you all!

48:15.101 --> 48:17.274
If we work together, we can beat them.

48:20.731 --> 48:23.359
We've been here for a long time.

48:24.151 --> 48:27.451
Only now do we know this place.

48:27.905 --> 48:30.033
Welcome to our island, friends!

48:30.116 --> 48:33.666
We're reasonable men.
All we want is your money.

48:35.037 --> 48:37.210
Squat! Hurry up! Understand?

48:37.540 --> 48:40.669
Don't do anything stupid,
and no one gets hurt!

48:43.421 --> 48:46.140
The ransom is $500,000 each.

48:46.215 --> 48:48.718
Do what you need to do.

48:48.801 --> 48:50.223
Bravo!

48:50.302 --> 48:52.100
Or we can feed you to the sharks!

48:52.179 --> 48:53.601
Bravo!

48:53.681 --> 48:56.480
I don't mind
keeping the women, though.

48:56.559 --> 48:58.482
Bravo!

48:58.686 --> 48:59.812
Let me tell you something.

49:00.187 --> 49:01.939
We are not with them.

49:02.022 --> 49:05.071
And my boss would be very happy
to get you any money you want.

49:05.151 --> 49:06.277
He's very rich.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.704
Those guys want to fight you,
but I said, "No"!

49:11.157 --> 49:12.204
Take them away! Go!

49:12.491 --> 49:13.868
Thank you!

49:14.368 --> 49:16.291
So, fellas, what are you doing on my island?

49:16.704 --> 49:18.456
We do not understand English.

49:18.539 --> 49:19.586
It's my hat!

49:20.541 --> 49:21.542
Hey!

49:22.042 --> 49:23.794
Tell me, what are you doing here?

49:23.878 --> 49:24.879
Don't understand.

49:24.962 --> 49:26.714
- Mandarin?
- Mmm.

49:28.632 --> 49:31.101
Boss asked what you were doing here.

49:33.721 --> 49:35.064
Barbecue.

49:35.556 --> 49:36.808
What did you say?

49:37.308 --> 49:38.776
This is a metal detector.

49:40.019 --> 49:41.487
Barbecue? With this?

49:41.562 --> 49:42.984
What are you doing with this?

49:43.355 --> 49:44.732
Mini microwave.

49:46.692 --> 49:48.569
Do you think I'm stupid?

49:48.819 --> 49:50.821
This is a metal detector.

49:51.030 --> 49:52.156
What are you looking for?

49:52.907 --> 49:55.080
Okay. You don't want to tell me?

49:55.618 --> 49:57.370
I'll find out.

49:57.453 --> 49:58.500
Take the girls.

49:58.579 --> 49:59.671
Hands off!

50:01.415 --> 50:02.462
Lie down!

50:21.227 --> 50:22.194
What the...

50:22.269 --> 50:23.316
I didn't pull the trigger!

50:23.604 --> 50:24.605
One o'clock!

50:30.110 --> 50:31.282
Boss! Are you okay?

50:33.155 --> 50:34.247
Don't move!

50:45.668 --> 50:47.921
I forgot to tell you. No bullets.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.385
- Don't let him get a gun!
- Right!

51:10.859 --> 51:11.860
Captain!

51:11.944 --> 51:13.070
Hurry!
This way!

51:14.488 --> 51:15.535
Twelve o'clock!

51:27.251 --> 51:28.878
- What should we do now, boss?
- Let's get out of here!

51:30.921 --> 51:33.845
Mother of Mercy, I'm scared!

51:48.564 --> 51:49.690
Snake head?

52:14.673 --> 52:15.799
Heads up!

52:24.808 --> 52:25.855
My foot!

52:26.977 --> 52:28.445
Ow! My foot!

52:30.481 --> 52:32.279
That's my great grandfather! No!

52:32.691 --> 52:34.284
No, no, no!

52:34.943 --> 52:38.664
No! My great grandfather! No, no, no!

52:49.750 --> 52:50.717
Sorry!

52:50.793 --> 52:51.794
It's okay.

52:51.877 --> 52:53.925
My great grandfather! Thank you.

52:54.046 --> 52:55.673
Girls, let's go!

52:55.881 --> 52:57.599
My foot! My shoe!

53:00.761 --> 53:02.104
- Come on!
- Okay.

53:08.352 --> 53:09.820
Hurry! Go!

53:10.521 --> 53:12.364
- Don't worry.
- What are you doing?

53:12.439 --> 53:13.611
-it's okay. It's safe.
- What are you doing?

53:14.775 --> 53:15.992
- Jump. Here.
- Come on!

53:16.068 --> 53:18.742
It's safe.
Here, don't be frightened.

53:19.780 --> 53:20.872
My foot...

53:20.948 --> 53:22.200
I got you. Go!

53:22.282 --> 53:23.283
- You first.
- Okay.

53:23.367 --> 53:24.664
- Gol
-Wait! My shoe'

53:24.743 --> 53:25.790
It's okay.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.206
Here.

53:29.707 --> 53:30.833
Come on!

53:31.208 --> 53:33.461
- It hurts!
- JC! Get the head!

53:34.586 --> 53:35.929
Catch the head!

53:36.380 --> 53:37.757
- Take them and go!
- What about you?

53:37.840 --> 53:39.217
- Meet you at the trunk!
- Right!

53:40.509 --> 53:41.977
There's something in my shoe.

53:46.640 --> 53:47.687
Take it!

53:55.649 --> 53:56.741
Catch!

53:57.818 --> 53:58.910
Any more?

53:59.653 --> 54:00.654
Don't move!

54:00.904 --> 54:02.497
This gun has bullets.

54:04.241 --> 54:05.288
Quick!

54:08.036 --> 54:09.037
Help me!

54:09.121 --> 54:10.873
- Oh, come on!
- Count to three!

54:13.500 --> 54:14.467
- One, two...
- Hey!

54:20.257 --> 54:21.258
No! No!

54:21.341 --> 54:23.309
- Just one?
- I have only one life!

54:44.072 --> 54:45.073
Are they all dead?

54:45.157 --> 54:46.204
Run!

54:53.207 --> 54:55.005
Don't move! Hands up!

54:57.377 --> 54:59.379
I'm done being reasonable!

55:00.547 --> 55:02.549
Barbecue this, smart guy!

55:32.913 --> 55:34.540
- Don't move! Don't move!
- Don't move! Don't move!

55:48.929 --> 55:50.021
- You okay?
- What do you care?

55:51.807 --> 55:53.559
'Go, 90, go!
- This Way!

55:55.435 --> 55:58.655
- Got her. Let's go!
- Go, go, go! Are you all right?

55:58.730 --> 56:00.073
Take this!

56:01.358 --> 56:02.610
JC. This?

56:03.569 --> 56:04.741
Oh!

56:05.821 --> 56:07.073
Come on!

56:08.866 --> 56:10.243
Catch this!

56:13.620 --> 56:14.621
We are so lucky!

56:17.749 --> 56:20.298
My foot! It really hurts!

56:20.544 --> 56:21.921
A bone!

56:26.133 --> 56:27.134
Coco! You okay?

56:27.759 --> 56:29.181
- Gold!
- How'd you know there's gold?

56:29.720 --> 56:31.472
- It fell out.
- You know that there's gold in the trunk?

56:31.805 --> 56:33.182
I didn't say it was from the trunk.

56:33.265 --> 56:34.391
- Let me see.
-It's from my shoe.

56:34.474 --> 56:36.977
- Is there gold inside the trunk?
- No, no.

56:39.146 --> 56:40.648
- Pack it up!
- It's changed!

56:40.731 --> 56:42.483
- The Snake head?
- JC!

56:45.777 --> 56:47.324
The Dragon head must be back in there!

56:47.487 --> 56:48.488
- You go!
- You go!

56:48.822 --> 56:51.496
- Never mind!
- How do we get out of here?

56:52.326 --> 56:53.373
- One way!
-One way!

56:56.204 --> 56:57.330
Wait!

56:57.706 --> 57:00.050
- Watch my hand.
- I got it, no problem!

57:00.125 --> 57:01.593
"Got it", my ass. My turn!

57:03.003 --> 57:04.255
Watch my hand.

57:04.630 --> 57:06.007
Captain, Captain! Go southeast!

57:07.841 --> 57:09.593
The road ends here!

57:10.761 --> 57:12.013
This way!

57:14.848 --> 57:15.895
Get ready!

57:15.974 --> 57:17.271
- One, two, three!
- One, two, three!

57:25.359 --> 57:26.360
It's stuck!

57:27.945 --> 57:30.573
What's going on?
No time to explain!

57:39.206 --> 57:40.708
You've got nowhere to go!

57:40.791 --> 57:42.714
Come. Don't shoot! Come on!

57:43.961 --> 57:45.963
- Scarf! Scarf! Quick!
- Right.

57:46.046 --> 57:47.093
Hurry!

57:47.881 --> 57:49.724
- Put it on them.
- Here.

57:49.800 --> 57:50.801
Put it on!

57:50.884 --> 57:51.851
- Simon!
- Yeah?

57:51.927 --> 57:53.554
- Here.
- Put it on!

57:55.263 --> 57:56.890
Have some honey!

57:58.850 --> 58:00.227
<i>I</i> told you!

58:07.734 --> 58:09.031
Fire in the hole!

58:09.945 --> 58:11.822
- Can you do it?
- You do it!

58:11.905 --> 58:13.748
- You do it!
- What? No!

58:25.168 --> 58:26.920
The bees are coming!

58:27.504 --> 58:29.598
Smoke bombs! Hurry!

58:43.687 --> 58:45.564
It's moving. Go!

59:11.131 --> 59:12.883
Stop! You stupid!

59:12.966 --> 59:15.185
It doesn't matter! Let them go!

59:18.722 --> 59:21.646
We still have five.

59:26.396 --> 59:27.818
The bees are not so friendly.

59:27.898 --> 59:29.650
- One of you guys I'll kill.
- No! No! No!

59:29.816 --> 59:31.659
- Call your boss!
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

59:54.132 --> 59:56.760
- Everybody okay?
"Okay!

59:56.843 --> 59:58.015
Money!

01:00:18.031 --> 01:00:20.033
- Everybody okay?
"Okay!

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.585
Anybody hurt?

01:00:21.827 --> 01:00:24.626
- Yeah, okay!
- You lost your great grandfather.

01:00:24.704 --> 01:00:26.832
It's okay. It's okay. He loved the sea.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.553
- Hey! Here!
- Here!

01:00:43.557 --> 01:00:45.184
Hey. guys! Here!

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:51.441
Inside this trunk,
there are 2,900 pieces of gold.

01:00:51.523 --> 01:00:54.026
Multiply that by the density of the gold,
and that means that...

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:56.328
There are 8 tons?
So much!

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:57.404
A ton each.

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.450
- What's the result'?
- Eight tons! Maybe more!

01:01:00.532 --> 01:01:02.751
Let's celebrate! Let's go outside!

01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.379
One word for this journey, romantic!

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:07.004
Thrilling!

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.423
Rewarding!

01:01:08.540 --> 01:01:09.587
Intriguing!

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:11.964
Satisfying!

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:43.576
<i>Leave your message after the tone.</i>

01:01:43.658 --> 01:01:46.002
I know you're next to the phone.

01:01:46.411 --> 01:01:49.631
Stop sulking
and pick up the phone and yell at me.

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:51.958
Fine then!

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.919
Can't you two
ever have a proper conversation?

01:01:54.002 --> 01:01:58.223
We start off nice and calm every time,
but we always end up having a fight.

01:01:58.298 --> 01:01:59.845
- Morning!
- Morning!

01:01:59.925 --> 01:02:01.893
- Thank you for last night!
- Sure. So, do you guys...

01:02:01.968 --> 01:02:03.766
- Hey, your medicine.
- Thank you.

01:02:04.054 --> 01:02:06.022
Do you guys have something
you want to tell me?

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:08.650
- Like what?
- Good morning, everybody!

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.276
What are you trying to say?

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:13.905
You always meant to look for that gold.
You even brought metal detectors.

01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:17.367
Gold or bronze, we need metal detectors.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:18.819
Still lying!

01:02:20.028 --> 01:02:22.281
You wanted to find this gold, didn't you?

01:02:25.033 --> 01:02:26.376
How could you go through my stuff?

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:28.078
Stop being a jerk.

01:02:28.161 --> 01:02:30.380
After he threw up,
I helped you back to your room and saw it.

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:31.961
Hey, check it out! Dolphins.

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:34.467
Ah! Whales, too!

01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.303
Crocodiles!

01:02:36.378 --> 01:02:38.005
- There's no crocodiles in the sea.
- There are?

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.257
They can swim over.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:42.224
You work well together.

01:02:43.718 --> 01:02:46.141
Since you know, fire away.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.894
You're not even Shangguan Martin,
Martin Shangguan.

01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:50.267
Yeah.

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:52.606
You weren't looking
for Catherine's great grandfather.

01:02:52.686 --> 01:02:54.063
You came for the gold and the bronze heads!

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.027
You could say that.

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:59.367
Whenever you recover a bronze head,
you end up auctioning it.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:02.328
- True.
- What do you plan to do with these two?

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:04.872
They will be picked up at the port.

01:03:05.448 --> 01:03:07.792
I thought you were doing this
for the Chinese people.

01:03:07.867 --> 01:03:08.914
But you're just a mercenary!

01:03:09.536 --> 01:03:13.166
There are antiques everywhere.
Why can't we profit a little from them?

01:03:13.248 --> 01:03:14.249
You feel no shame?

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.967
What about national dignity?

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:18.886
These battered heads
have nothing to do with dignity.

01:03:19.254 --> 01:03:21.222
They represent centuries
of our cultural heritage!

01:03:21.756 --> 01:03:24.475
Centuries are nothing!
China is thousands of years old.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:27.103
What we could achieve then,
we can do better now.

01:03:27.178 --> 01:03:30.352
- What's going on?
- Boy-girl problem. Come on.

01:03:30.974 --> 01:03:34.444
I'll get someone to make you a dozen,
from every dynasty.

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:35.520
Scoundrel!

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:37.360
What, me?

01:03:37.731 --> 01:03:40.735
From your first day with Professor Guan
and then meeting me, you've been using us!

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:44.405
Young lady,
don't pretend you're holier than me.

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:45.864
We didn't ask you to come.

01:03:45.947 --> 01:03:48.575
If a fish doesn't open its mouth,
it can't take a bite.

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.705
It's, "Take the bait"!

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.211
Being a cheat is nothing to be proud of.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.167
Your victims trusted you.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:03:59.093
Come on!
We did this long before we met you.

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.594
Doesn't matter what you do.

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.672
But if you wrong your family
and your countrymen,

01:04:02.756 --> 01:04:05.009
your children and grandchildren
will live in shame!

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:06.343
Stop the boat!

01:04:08.803 --> 01:04:10.271
What's wrong?

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:11.765
The gold!

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:23.201
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stay in the boat.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.386
What happened?

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:43.634
It was fine just now.

01:04:44.339 --> 01:04:47.309
The gold was heavy, and it had
been soaking for too long. it sunk.

01:04:47.384 --> 01:04:49.136
Didn't you calculate?

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:52.063
You're the one who didn't do it right!
You only tied the rope to one end!

01:04:52.138 --> 01:04:53.811
- No, it's not. It's all your fault!
- Me?

01:04:53.973 --> 01:04:56.021
- Shut up! Hey!
- You're the one who messed it up!

01:04:56.101 --> 01:04:58.195
It's no one's fault. Talk on the boat!

01:04:58.770 --> 01:05:00.147
We can return and salvage it.

01:05:00.647 --> 01:05:02.445
- Yeah.
-"Right", my <i>ass!</i>

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:05.118
It all belongs
to the pirates around here, now.

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:07.662
Consider it a fee. We're sharing it.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:11.332
The seas here have pirates
from seven nations. How do we share it?

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:12.826
Enough! Knock it off!

01:05:13.243 --> 01:05:15.496
If it's any consolation to you,
I still have one.

01:05:16.371 --> 01:05:18.044
Whoever needs money, can have it.

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:25.510
You are luckier than her great grandfather.
At least you won't go home empty-handed.

01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.006
True.

01:05:27.424 --> 01:05:30.052
Someone did try to take the gold back
to their country once,

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:32.354
but no matter what,
it will never leave the Earth.

01:05:32.887 --> 01:05:34.514
Pirates from seven nations now guard it.

01:05:35.014 --> 01:05:36.436
More safe put in the bank.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:38.192
We'll leave it all here undisturbed.

01:05:49.279 --> 01:05:50.781
Mark the coordinates. Hurry!

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:01.875
Professor Guan.

01:06:01.958 --> 01:06:05.303
Professor Guan, your help is needed
on the theft of the bronze heads.

01:06:05.378 --> 01:06:08.006
Carry on, and follow my instructions.

01:06:10.383 --> 01:06:13.478
<i>REPORTER". Today, the sale of a bronze
Ram's head and a bronze Snake's head</i>

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.897
<i>has set a new record
at an art auction in London.</i>

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.941
<i>The last one, the Dragon,
is expected to sell for even more.</i>

01:06:19.684 --> 01:06:22.563
<i>The sale of the bronze heads
has provoked much controversy.</i>

01:06:23.021 --> 01:06:27.777
<i>Calls for repatriation of relics
are intensifying.</i>

01:06:27.901 --> 01:06:30.654
<i>We don't want our patriotic
sentiment to be hijacked.</i>

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:34.032
<i>Thanks to these young people
who try hard in expressing their views.</i>

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:35.784
Yes!

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:38.503
<i>The golden mask of a pharaoh's concubine</i>

01:06:38.578 --> 01:06:42.173
<i>and the sacred smiling Buddha
were passed in an auction today,</i>

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:45.593
<i>affected by the increasing
international uproar.</i>

01:06:49.255 --> 01:06:50.256
Police.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:52.384
Do you know these people?

01:06:56.888 --> 01:06:59.641
<i>In breaking news,
MP Corporation has announced</i>

01:06:59.724 --> 01:07:02.694
<i>it has won the right
to auction off the bronze Dragon head.</i>

01:07:02.769 --> 01:07:05.272
<i>The piece will go to market
as soon as possible.</i>

01:07:05.563 --> 01:07:09.363
From now on, forever and ever,
I will never bother you again.

01:07:09.734 --> 01:07:11.281
We found it! We found it!

01:07:11.778 --> 01:07:13.280
You found what?

01:07:15.657 --> 01:07:19.252
The Dragon head.
MP will put it up for auction next week.

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:24.007
Yeah, and they've had it all along.
That bonus, we could've never gotten it.

01:07:24.541 --> 01:07:28.136
- So we've been conned.
- Yeah, we behaved like amateurs.

01:07:28.503 --> 01:07:30.176
And Jonathan lied to us.

01:07:30.255 --> 01:07:32.974
He's been working with MP.
I think they beat up those students, too.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:39.560
...profit has just released
its new sales catalogue, causing concern...

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:43.518
ENOUGH OF THE SELLING
OF NATIONAL TREASURES

01:07:44.352 --> 01:07:48.778
In time for the Chinese Year of the Dragon,
I present the bronze Dragon head.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:51.360
Starting price, €6O million.

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.907
National Heritage not for sale!

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.786
Cultural relics from many countries
were pillaged and ended up abroad.

01:07:56.864 --> 01:07:59.083
They include
the renowned bronze Dragon head,

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:01.581
one of the 12 zodiac bronze heads.

01:08:01.703 --> 01:08:04.172
Ladies and gentlemen, are there any bids?

01:08:05.331 --> 01:08:06.298
€10.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:11.796
<i>Pass!</i>

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.013
REPORTERS:
Any comment on the unsold Dragon head?

01:08:16.217 --> 01:08:17.434
Will the Dragon head be re-auctioned again?

01:08:17.510 --> 01:08:20.514
Do you think not selling this piece
will affect the reputation of MP Corporation?

01:08:26.978 --> 01:08:28.070
Get different angles!

01:08:28.396 --> 01:08:30.694
Michelle, send this to Coco, quick!

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.406
Hey, take a few more with this.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:42.832
What interview? I do not give interviews.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.712
<i>- Hello?
- Boss,</i>

01:08:45.371 --> 01:08:46.543
we caught three students. What now?

01:08:46.831 --> 01:08:49.129
- They took photos.
- Just lock them up for now.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:52.845
- There's really no other solution?
- Why let it drag on?

01:08:53.963 --> 01:08:56.591
- Thought about it all morning.
- Thanks!

01:08:56.758 --> 01:09:00.388
- Joni, Tommy, Jeffrey, Shirley...
- Would you please give this letter to her?

01:09:01.262 --> 01:09:04.106
Take it easy with women. Be cool, like me.

01:09:05.350 --> 01:09:07.523
Hello! Ah? Ah?

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.605
Yes, yes! I know, I know it's you.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:14.488
- Finally returning his calls!
- No, no, no, not busy.

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:17.116
Those two idiots were leaving. Yeah.

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:21.325
Whatever you want. You pick.

01:09:25.078 --> 01:09:27.080
Chinese, Italian, French.

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:29.590
Yeah. Whatever you want.

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:31.713
Right.

01:09:31.918 --> 01:09:33.044
Okay-

01:09:33.711 --> 01:09:34.928
I agree.

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:36.923
Good choice!

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:38.178
So true.

01:09:38.257 --> 01:09:41.682
Great. Yeah, I'll wait for you.
Till the end of time.

01:09:41.761 --> 01:09:43.183
Yes. Yes. Bye-bye!

01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:49.773
Yes! Yes!

01:09:51.437 --> 01:09:53.940
I got her wrapped around my finger.

01:09:55.108 --> 01:09:58.954
Like they say,
"As a man sows, so shall he reap".

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:02.074
-"God helps those who help themselves".
- Coco's here.

01:10:02.156 --> 01:10:04.705
- Who?
- Coco, outside. Wants you.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:07.871
What does she want?

01:10:11.416 --> 01:10:12.463
For me?

01:10:19.465 --> 01:10:20.887
Are those students okay?

01:10:21.801 --> 01:10:22.802
Three more are missing now.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.349
What?

01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:28.274
<i>COCO". My brother, Lily and Michelle.</i>

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:30.522
Before my father passed away,

01:10:32.478 --> 01:10:34.731
he asked me to always look after him.

01:10:36.357 --> 01:10:38.325
He's my only family now.

01:10:39.902 --> 01:10:41.825
He is our family's future.

01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:47.536
We're all passionate about each making
our own contributions to our countries.

01:10:47.618 --> 01:10:52.089
But now, two of us are lying in hospital beds,
and three of us are missing.

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.751
And we don't even know
if they are alive or dead.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:55.835
I beg you.

01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:57.962
Did you call the police?

01:10:59.464 --> 01:11:00.966
I've tried everything.

01:11:01.048 --> 01:11:03.642
There's nothing else to do.
You're my last resort.

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:07.055
Of course if I can help you, I will.

01:11:07.513 --> 01:11:09.231
But these people...

01:11:09.766 --> 01:11:11.985
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

01:11:15.730 --> 01:11:18.483
And because Professor Guan
gave me the data,

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:20.989
he's been detained by the police.

01:11:30.995 --> 01:11:32.713
Why are you crying?

01:11:55.061 --> 01:12:02.070
Mom and Dad, do you really have to do this?

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:08.541
Coco said her brother disappeared

01:12:08.616 --> 01:12:11.165
while spying on the MP
after the Dragon head auction.

01:12:11.244 --> 01:12:12.712
MP must have something to do with this.

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.373
There are trees, nothing else.
Where's the proof'?

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:17.458
Find it! Aren't you a compassionate person?

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:19.590
I feel more for you. Is this what you want?

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:23.389
- We can't even tolerate each other.
- What, tolerate each other?

01:12:23.464 --> 01:12:25.432
Do you stink?
Does he embarrass you in public?

01:12:25.508 --> 01:12:27.226
Don't just give up until you've really tried.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:31.022
Stop patronising me and go and save them,
or it will be too late!

01:12:31.097 --> 01:12:33.816
Promising to help them is easy. But how?

01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:36.610
You're the one who said
you mustn't give up until you've tried!

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:38.654
- Hey, JC!
- Hey! Jonathan!

01:12:38.771 --> 01:12:39.772
<i>What's up?</i>

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.530
You won't believe it.
I just found the <i>Roses</i> painting.

01:12:42.608 --> 01:12:44.531
<i>Great, I'll come right over!</i>

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:45.987
See, that's the way!

01:12:46.195 --> 01:12:47.367
Speak!

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:49.574
I didn't lie about MP's address.
Why would I lie about it?

01:12:49.657 --> 01:12:50.909
I believe you.

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:55.418
But you knew that MP had the Dragon head.
And we'll never get the bonus, would we?

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:58.424
How would I know'?
We're old partners. Why would I lie to you?

01:12:58.499 --> 01:13:02.129
- You never lied to me?
- No way! Why would I lie to you?

01:13:03.004 --> 01:13:04.051
What are you doing?

01:13:04.130 --> 01:13:07.885
This is the world's most powerful acid.
I made it just for you.

01:13:07.967 --> 01:13:10.311
And don't move!
Have you lied to me?

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:14.140
Yes. I lied to you from day one.
From day one!

01:13:18.644 --> 01:13:21.363
I told the truth, so why'd you do that?

01:13:23.816 --> 01:13:26.160
Fruity salts.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:27.577
Genius!

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:31.749
Did you find Simon and David?
Probably on a date.

01:13:33.618 --> 01:13:37.919
You came all the way out here to see me,
or is this visit just to cut out the middleman?

01:13:37.997 --> 01:13:41.752
They are blood-suckers.
Jonathan lied about the Dragon head.

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:46.469
Can't really blame him.
We've had the Dragon head for ages.

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.094
Even I forgot about it.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.141
Never mind.

01:13:49.216 --> 01:13:52.516
In our business, we all cheat each other.
I'm used to it.

01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:55.306
Where's the <i>Roses?</i>

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:07.030
We wouldn't have brought it here
if it was a fake.

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.361
I still have to examine it.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:11.038
- But it can't leave our sight.
- Fine.

01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:17.162
Just go ahead.

01:14:17.912 --> 01:14:18.959
Check this out for me.

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:22.967
I can't clone one so quickly.

01:14:25.211 --> 01:14:27.054
Verify this, please.

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:28.472
Wait here.

01:14:29.131 --> 01:14:30.474
Can we look around, too?

01:14:30.967 --> 01:14:31.968
Be my guest.

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:34.600
Who'd have thought they could hide
a huge lab under a vineyard?

01:14:34.679 --> 01:14:36.681
Actually, it's a hub for counterfeiting.

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:39.608
They make billions every year.
They control everything.

01:14:40.393 --> 01:14:42.316
Hey! What are those guys doing there?

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:46.741
They're sandblasting a porcelain vase,
which will then be chemically treated.

01:14:46.816 --> 01:14:50.286
After that,
it will end up looking like an old antique.

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:53.660
Chinese Xuan paper is layered
and can be separated.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:56.993
This is an original.
Peel it apart, get two originals.

01:14:57.076 --> 01:14:59.329
- Can't you make five or six?
- They'd be too thin.

01:14:59.412 --> 01:15:02.165
- What about that?
- That one's silk, no layers.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:05.297
So they slice it up into eight parts for sale.

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.382
I'm impressed they thought of it.

01:15:08.754 --> 01:15:12.008
See? The pieces of old relics
can be perfectly restored.

01:15:12.091 --> 01:15:13.889
They just combine the parts with replicas.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:16.433
So it's partly real, partly fake?

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:21.313
After exposure to X-ray, a brand new vase
can gain 1,000 years of history.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.983
They're very resourceful.
How much on the market is real?

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:26.735
90% are fakes now.

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:28.691
I pity those rich people.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:30.276
Hey. This way.

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:33.700
Wow. What is this?

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:37.033
This is a special furnace
to emulate carbon emissions.

01:15:37.116 --> 01:15:39.539
Designed to fool antique experts.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:41.750
But is not perfect yet.

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:45.584
So the fuel and the catalyst
still have to be added by hand.

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:49.011
I can't believe they'd try this.

01:15:49.712 --> 01:15:51.635
Well, it looks very crude. Is it dangerous?

01:15:52.923 --> 01:15:55.472
Anything involving deception
is dangerous.

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:58.145
Hey! Nice to see you, JC!

01:16:03.768 --> 01:16:05.270
Did you lose your tongue?

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:08.697
- I don't want to see you.
- Come on, man.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:11.492
- Who's this guy?
- This is JC.

01:16:11.984 --> 01:16:13.657
A big name in the business.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:15.742
Reputations can be deceiving.

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.282
Competitor?

01:16:18.365 --> 01:16:21.164
We are not the same.
We will never do what he does.

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:22.790
Hey, don't be so cocksure, all right?

01:16:23.204 --> 01:16:25.423
Whatever you do, I can do better.

01:16:29.835 --> 01:16:34.011
Vulture, you stole a Buddha
from a Southeast Asian temple.

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:36.934
That's right. And those people still think

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:39.603
that it was the work
of a neighbouring country.

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:43.266
It sparked a border war,
killing thousands of people.

01:16:43.474 --> 01:16:44.851
People die.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:46.143
That's their business.

01:16:47.228 --> 01:16:49.196
You're the scumbag of our business.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:53.450
You know, the last person who called me that
is no longer breathing.

01:16:53.651 --> 01:16:54.743
Oh, yeah?

01:16:56.695 --> 01:17:01.371
S-C-U-M-B-A-G.

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:03.752
Scumbag.

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:07.252
I can kick your ass
without leaving this couch.

01:17:12.044 --> 01:17:13.261
Show me.

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:34.362
You lose!

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:36.235
Still touching.

01:18:46.138 --> 01:18:47.139
Hey!

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:55.148
Touching.

01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:58.533
Stop!

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.781
You can all go now. Have a good vacation.

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:03.864
Good night!

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:11.497
What are you guys doing?

01:19:12.206 --> 01:19:13.708
Just checking the furniture.

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.344
Cheap imitation.

01:19:17.461 --> 01:19:20.886
Hey, boys, take it outside. Not here. Okay?

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:23.509
-It's real.
- The <i>Roses!</i>

01:19:24.385 --> 01:19:25.432
Eleven o'clock.

01:19:25.511 --> 01:19:28.185
Leave them here when you're done.
We'll clear them later, okay?

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.522
You'll be paid tomorrow. As usual.

01:19:33.185 --> 01:19:35.028
Your price is very high.
I think we should wait for Dad.

01:19:35.688 --> 01:19:37.736
I can give you a discount.

01:19:38.148 --> 01:19:39.195
But I want three people.

01:19:39.650 --> 01:19:40.742
What?

01:19:41.694 --> 01:19:44.038
The students you have up there.

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:48.125
I don't quite understand.

01:19:49.076 --> 01:19:50.123
Let me show you.

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.465
That confirms I'm right.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.219
Fine, then. Prove it if you can.

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:01.971
Hey.

01:20:05.259 --> 01:20:06.681
I will then.

01:20:07.720 --> 01:20:09.142
Stop him!

01:20:10.723 --> 01:20:12.771
I said stop!

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:13.851
Don't move!

01:20:16.979 --> 01:20:18.697
Don't let him get away!

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:20.573
Stop!

01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:24.862
Stop him!

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:46.217
There he is, let's go!

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.307
Go down! He's getting away!

01:21:12.659 --> 01:21:15.162
Open the door! Hurry!

01:21:40.437 --> 01:21:42.656
JC, so, now, what have you proved?

01:21:54.535 --> 01:21:55.536
Ooh!

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:02.293
Stop him! Don't let him run away!

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:19.519
I've been looking for a punching bag all day.

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:21.194
You hit the jackpot.

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:30.496
- Vulture, do something.
- No, no, no. It's girl-on-girl time.

01:22:30.571 --> 01:22:31.697
Oh, yeah!

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:33.369
Show me what you got!

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:16.743
He's over there! Get him!

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:20.079
Is he still going?

01:23:34.218 --> 01:23:35.219
Hmm!

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:51.735
Vulture, take him out!

01:23:52.778 --> 01:23:54.280
Five against one, man.

01:23:54.363 --> 01:23:57.207
Only cowards with no guts fight like that.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:59.330
Now, that is a fair game.

01:25:54.441 --> 01:25:55.693
So ugly!

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:04.493
What are you waiting for? Get him, go!

01:26:11.667 --> 01:26:12.668
It's gonna blow!

01:26:14.044 --> 01:26:15.216
"Run!
- Go!

01:26:15.295 --> 01:26:16.672
Get out of there, it's gonna blow!

01:26:17.506 --> 01:26:18.507
Run! Quick!

01:26:52.499 --> 01:26:54.627
Wu, you okay?

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:57.379
Martin?

01:27:04.469 --> 01:27:05.686
Michael!

01:27:06.972 --> 01:27:08.019
Dad!

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:15.238
- Bonnie!
- Here. I'm fine.

01:27:18.150 --> 01:27:19.197
Lawrence.

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:22.529
JC, finally we meet.

01:27:24.156 --> 01:27:25.328
Daddy!

01:27:25.824 --> 01:27:27.622
- JC did it!
- Shut up!

01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:29.161
You idiot.

01:27:29.244 --> 01:27:30.587
I'm going to kill you!

01:27:30.954 --> 01:27:32.752
What did I teach you?

01:27:32.831 --> 01:27:35.209
We don't kidnap people!
We make fake things!

01:27:35.292 --> 01:27:38.546
Boss, I think we need to leave
as soon as possible.

01:27:39.963 --> 01:27:42.011
- Is that real?
- It is real.

01:27:42.424 --> 01:27:45.268
- You got it tested?
- Yes, I've tested it.

01:27:49.014 --> 01:27:50.015
JCS.

01:27:51.141 --> 01:27:52.859
I wish we could've met
under different circumstances.

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:55.028
I wish you'd make real things.

01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.488
Well, you certainly took care of that.

01:27:57.564 --> 01:28:00.033
And for your trouble,
I'm going to keep this free of charge.

01:28:00.567 --> 01:28:05.164
Now, I certainly hope you'll escort
these nice young people home safely,

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:07.206
and then you and I
can resume our relationship.

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:08.329
Is that a deal?

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:13.588
Oh!

01:28:13.663 --> 01:28:17.668
Sorry about the Dragon.
I guess it just disappeared. No extra zero.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:19.378
Enjoy your Roses.

01:28:21.338 --> 01:28:24.763
- Dad, you're letting him off too easy.
-lnterpol's onto this place.

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:26.969
We have to destroy it anyway.
He just saved us the trouble.

01:28:27.511 --> 01:28:29.639
- I have a job for you.
- Yes, sir.

01:28:29.721 --> 01:28:34.443
The antique market has tanked because
of these whiny hippies and all their protests.

01:28:34.518 --> 01:28:37.738
I want to teach the world a lesson,
starting with the Dragon head.

01:28:37.813 --> 01:28:41.033
- How?
- Time for the Dragon to fly.

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.577
Vulture!

01:28:46.029 --> 01:28:47.201
What a pity-

01:28:49.366 --> 01:28:53.166
<i>Auction houses have come under pressure
after protests broke out around the world</i>

01:28:53.245 --> 01:28:55.168
<i>calling for the return of national treasures.</i>

01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:58.629
<i>Let's begin our private auction
for the precious Dragon Head.</i>

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:02.588
All right. Thank you so much!

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:04.218
Hey! Good news, good news!

01:29:04.422 --> 01:29:07.050
Chinese businesses worldwide
donated 50 million.

01:29:07.133 --> 01:29:08.134
Well, it's useless.

01:29:08.218 --> 01:29:11.518
The Chinese government won't accept
any relics that are acquired at an auction.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:13.815
Well, tell them we'll buy it first
and keep it in trust for them.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.813
We can't.
Whoever buys it becomes the enemy.

01:29:16.101 --> 01:29:19.901
<i>The second and last time it will
be up for auction, with no starting price.</i>

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:22.653
<i>Do I have any opening bids?</i>

01:29:23.066 --> 01:29:25.615
<i>With the international press
waiting for answers,</i>

01:29:25.694 --> 01:29:29.198
<i>MP Corporation has threatened
to dump the Dragon head into a volcano</i>

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:32.000
<i>if no bids are received before noon today.</i>

01:29:32.075 --> 01:29:36.251
You can see the volcano behind me.
The Dragon head might be consumed by it.

01:29:36.496 --> 01:29:39.670
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
our mid-day deadline is fast approaching,</i>

01:29:39.958 --> 01:29:42.302
<i>and I have yet to receive an opening bid.</i>

01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:43.632
<i>If the auction is aborted,</i>

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:47.091
<i>MP will dump the bronze Dragon head
into the active volcano in front of us.</i>

01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:49.763
Will the Dragon Head
be Thrown into the Volcano?

01:29:50.051 --> 01:29:53.055
<i>At this stage,
I haven't received any opening bids.</i>

01:29:53.722 --> 01:29:55.099
<i>Fair warning.</i>

01:29:56.641 --> 01:29:57.984
<i>Fair warning.</i>

01:29:58.393 --> 01:29:59.815
<i>Last chance.</i>

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:03.111
<i>This item is unsold!</i>

01:30:06.860 --> 01:30:09.659
Boss! The Dragon head's
been taken off the auction block.

01:30:12.073 --> 01:30:13.325
Dump it!

01:30:16.161 --> 01:30:18.459
All right, guys! Let's do this!

01:30:26.379 --> 01:30:28.882
It's really happened.
They've started the mission.

01:30:29.507 --> 01:30:30.929
<i>Looking at the three skydivers,</i>

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:33.307
<i>we can clearly see
one of them is holding the Dragon head.</i>

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:35.514
They're dumping it!
They're dumping it! Look!

01:30:37.724 --> 01:30:38.725
<i>NEWS ANCHOR". For the whole process,</i>

01:30:38.808 --> 01:30:43.735
<i>the MP Corporation has named this mission
"Let the Dragon Fly".</i>

01:30:54.574 --> 01:30:56.827
What is this? A fourth diver has appeared.

01:30:57.619 --> 01:30:59.747
Over there! Look over there!

01:32:56.029 --> 01:32:57.030
Wake up!

01:32:58.656 --> 01:33:00.374
Wake up! Wake up!

01:33:07.791 --> 01:33:10.385
Hey! Save her!

01:33:10.585 --> 01:33:11.928
Thank you!

01:33:26.559 --> 01:33:29.312
He dropped the Dragon's head.
It's falling towards the volcano!

01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:05.899
All that's left to do is open their parachutes!
Oh, no, they're still freefalling!

01:34:16.067 --> 01:34:18.365
You are a condor without wings.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:24.208
Don't even think you can beat me.

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:29.248
No! You're crazy!

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:34.261
Young skydiver is falling.
He does not have parachute.

01:34:34.335 --> 01:34:36.884
What will he do with Dragon head?

01:36:31.869 --> 01:36:33.246
It's yours!

01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:38.047
You're really something else, brother.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.919
<i>In our special report,
MP Corporation chief,</i>

01:37:13.995 --> 01:37:16.999
<i>Lawrence Morgan, and his son, Michael,
were arrested</i>

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:20.631
<i>after a priceless stolen painting, the Roses'
was found on MP property.</i>

01:37:20.710 --> 01:37:21.677
Yes!

01:37:21.753 --> 01:37:23.300
<i>And here's a special story.</i>

01:37:23.379 --> 01:37:26.428
<i>Today, four foreign consuls
each received unmarked packages</i>

01:37:26.507 --> 01:37:28.851
<i>containing long lost national treasures.</i>

01:37:28.926 --> 01:37:31.554
<i>They include
an Egyptian pharaoh's golden sceptre</i>

01:37:31.637 --> 01:37:33.935
<i>and Czarina Catherine of Russia's staff.</i>

01:37:34.015 --> 01:37:37.394
<i>And an lncan jewellery box
decorated with a golden eagle.</i>

01:37:37.643 --> 01:37:39.270
<i>And don't forget the Star of Arabia.</i>

01:37:39.937 --> 01:37:42.861
<i>Now nobody knows
who this mystery sender is.</i>

01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:44.401
<i>Quite amazing, isn't it?</i>

01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:47.199
<i>In similar news, Japan has just announced</i>

01:37:47.278 --> 01:37:50.908

01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:53.083
Yeah!

01:37:53.159 --> 01:37:55.082
Hey! My name is Anna.

01:37:55.161 --> 01:37:57.630

Association of Cultural Preservation,

01:37:57.705 --> 01:37:59.799
I give you this <i>as</i> a token of our appreciation.

01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:01.835
Thank you very much.

01:38:01.918 --> 01:38:04.387
No need.
He's sold more than he's given back.

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:07.302
Look, Professor Guan's been freed.

01:38:07.799 --> 01:38:11.303
- Mr Liao, your wife has just given birth!
-I'm coming!

01:38:11.761 --> 01:38:13.559
- I got to go!
- Just go. Go. See you.

01:38:13.638 --> 01:38:14.935
- I'll go see.
- JC.

01:38:16.015 --> 01:38:17.062
You're the man!

01:38:18.059 --> 01:38:20.653
<i>You asked me out,
and you're still not here!</i>

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:22.822
This voicemail's really loud. Listen. See ya.

01:38:22.897 --> 01:38:26.322
<i>I've eaten every cuisine and I had dessert!
Don't call me any more!</i>

01:38:26.609 --> 01:38:28.828
- Coco! Coco!
- Goodbye!

01:38:29.112 --> 01:38:30.409
- Catherine!
- Catherine.

01:38:30.488 --> 01:38:32.991
- I have something for you.
- See you.

01:38:33.366 --> 01:38:34.663
<i>Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt?</i>

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.790
I learned from you. I stole it!

01:38:36.869 --> 01:38:38.667
Bankers won't know
how to appreciate it anyway.

01:38:38.746 --> 01:38:39.747
You...

01:38:39.831 --> 01:38:42.835
Since we parted, I've been learning Chinese.

01:38:45.128 --> 01:38:46.721
- A present from my sister.
- Thank you.

01:38:50.007 --> 01:38:51.224
"Purple!
"Purple!

01:38:52.218 --> 01:38:53.265
HOW is JC?

01:38:53.344 --> 01:38:54.345
He's awake. You can go and see him.

01:38:54.429 --> 01:38:55.772
I'll go to see him now.

01:38:55.847 --> 01:38:56.973
Okay-

01:38:57.598 --> 01:38:59.191
<i>Emperor Qianlong's Autumn Hunt!
Let's see it!</i>

01:39:01.853 --> 01:39:03.150
Go and try to settle it.

01:39:05.189 --> 01:39:06.190
Mama!

01:39:11.446 --> 01:39:13.665
Only the efforts
of two half-decent people

01:39:13.739 --> 01:39:16.242
can give her a decent environment
to grow up in.

01:39:16.325 --> 01:39:17.497
<i>30"'!</i>

01:39:20.204 --> 01:39:23.253
If you're willing, we can start this over.

01:39:28.546 --> 01:39:31.516
Hey! It's a girl! Come and see! Come and see!

01:39:32.258 --> 01:39:34.306
Congratulations! What's her name?

01:39:34.385 --> 01:39:36.638
- Pax. It's Latin for "peace".
- Pax?

01:39:36.721 --> 01:39:38.394
JC gave me four names, and I...

01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:40.983
- Sister?
- Sister?

01:39:43.060 --> 01:39:45.188
- Who's she?
- She's the woman from the voice-mail.

01:39:45.271 --> 01:39:47.569
- Let's see.
- I'll be right back.

01:39:52.236 --> 01:39:54.364
Come here. Come here. Here.

01:39:54.739 --> 01:39:55.740
Who is she?

01:39:56.115 --> 01:39:58.163
He's going to be fine.
In fact, he is healing quickly.

01:39:58.242 --> 01:40:00.836
Well, you should be able to check him out of
here within a week or two.

01:40:00.912 --> 01:40:02.038
Thank you.

01:40:06.334 --> 01:40:08.757
- I was just thinking...
-it's okay.

01:40:09.212 --> 01:40:13.012
That was an old message.
Now that I know what you've been up to...

01:40:13.090 --> 01:40:14.262
Get up!

01:40:20.973 --> 01:40:22.190
Action!

01:40:51.963 --> 01:40:52.964
I burned my hand.

01:40:55.758 --> 01:40:57.886
Get the dogs!
Control them!

01:41:01.806 --> 01:41:03.808
Trainer! Trainer!

01:41:35.673 --> 01:41:39.303
Jackie! Don't stand too close
to the edge! It's dangerous!

01:41:43.180 --> 01:41:45.854
I just saw the volcano explode next to me.

01:41:47.226 --> 01:41:49.775
Don't worry. Volcanoes are scared of me.

01:42:19.300 --> 01:42:20.643
You really slapped me!

01:42:30.519 --> 01:42:32.146
NG, stupid!

01:43:01.634 --> 01:43:02.635
Was it okay?

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.354
We were not the same.
We are...

01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:07.272
"We are not the same.

01:43:07.473 --> 01:43:09.817
"We will never do what he does."

01:43:10.309 --> 01:43:11.526
Stay clear.

01:43:11.602 --> 01:43:12.945
Chubby, let's have some smoke!

01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:14.981
Three, two...

01:43:25.116 --> 01:43:26.789
Even machines understand me.

01:43:29.453 --> 01:43:31.126
Everybody, hold!

01:45:42.503 --> 01:45:47.179
<i>Every time I do a dangerous
action scene, I get really, really scared.</i>

01:45:47.258 --> 01:45:48.976
<i>A lot goes through my mind,</i>

01:45:49.051 --> 01:45:54.023
<i>like, "Maybe this is my last scene",
or "Maybe this is my last shot in my life."</i>

01:48:07.147 --> 01:48:11.573
<i>One day, I can proudly tell
my grandchildren that this was me,</i>

01:48:11.652 --> 01:48:13.120
<i>this was Jackie Chan.</i>

01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:15.455
<i>I am so proud of myself.</i>

01:48:16.031 --> 01:48:17.624
<i>I want to take this time</i>

01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:22.251
<i>to thank my fans from all of the world,
for your continuous support,</i>

01:48:23.038 --> 01:48:24.836
<i>positive or negative,</i>

01:48:25.332 --> 01:48:29.337
<i>I've learnt a lot from your feedback.
It makes me who I am today.</i>

01:48:29.712 --> 01:48:33.842
<i>I would love to keep making movies
that the whole world will enjoy.</i>

01:48:35.801 --> 01:48:37.428
<i>I am Jackie Chan.</i>

01:48:38.095 --> 01:48:39.438
<i>Thank you.</i>
