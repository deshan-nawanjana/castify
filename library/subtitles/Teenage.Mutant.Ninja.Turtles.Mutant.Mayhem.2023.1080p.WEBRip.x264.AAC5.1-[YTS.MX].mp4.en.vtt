WEBVTT

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.674
- Listen up.
- Sir.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:42.844
We're going after
Dr. Baxter Stockman.

00:00:42.977 --> 00:00:45.512
He was TCRI's
lead genetic scientist,

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:46.914
but he went rogue,

00:00:47.048 --> 00:00:49.083
stole billions of dollars'
worth of research

00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:52.820
and created an actual mutant.

00:00:52.954 --> 00:00:56.290
He's holed up
in a makeshift lab
of an abandoned building.

00:00:56.423 --> 00:00:57.591
Each of you has been issued

00:00:57.724 --> 00:00:59.793
a high-powered
antimutant neutralizer.

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:02.930
Whatever Stockman's made,
this can unmake it.

00:01:03.064 --> 00:01:06.133
Cynthia Utrom herself
will be quarterbacking from HQ.

00:01:06.267 --> 00:01:07.734
Anything to add, Cynthia?

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.405
<i>This mission</i>
<i>is of the utmost importance.</i>

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.476
<i>Failure will be frowned upon.</i>

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.446
<i>Bring me Stockman's mutant</i>

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.482
<i>and whatever he used</i>
<i>to make it.</i>

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:24.252
You heard her, boys.
Lock and load.

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:26.486
Yes, sir!

00:01:56.117 --> 00:01:59.820
I've done it, little one.
I've perfected the ooze.

00:01:59.954 --> 00:02:02.589
Are you excited for Daddy?

00:02:02.722 --> 00:02:05.625
My friends at TCRI...

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.195
...want to use you as a weapon.

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.331
I couldn't allow that.

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:12.099
But we're safe now.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:15.468
Soon I'll make you
brothers and sisters.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.272
A real family for both of us.

00:02:19.106 --> 00:02:22.009
I never had a family,
little one.

00:02:22.143 --> 00:02:23.443
Nobody liked me.

00:02:23.576 --> 00:02:24.946
I always felt
a greater connection

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.815
to the animals
I experimented on
than people.

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.284
With you and your siblings...

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:32.820
...I'm creating a family.

00:02:32.954 --> 00:02:35.755
I think we can finally be happy.

00:02:39.327 --> 00:02:40.828
Move, move!

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:42.830
- Go, go!
- Spread out!

00:02:44.398 --> 00:02:45.900
Move, move, move!

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.070
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Get visuals.

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:50.737
Where is the specimen?

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.812
It's not here.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.715
Wait, wait, be careful.
Stay quiet.

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.118
Huh? Over there!

00:03:15.396 --> 00:03:17.164
Cease-fire!
We need them alive!

00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:22.103
Don't move.

00:03:37.952 --> 00:03:39.420
No! No, don't shoot!

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:41.956
The chemicals are
highly volatile! No!

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:47.194
Let's go in.
Uh-huh.

00:03:57.104 --> 00:03:58.873
Cynthia, I'm sorry.

00:03:59.606 --> 00:04:00.841
<i>We lost everything.</i>

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:04.045
Bring me anything you can find.

00:04:04.178 --> 00:04:07.714
<i>We will replicate</i>
<i>his research,</i>

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:11.252
<i>no matter how long it takes.</i>

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.722
<i>Baxter Stockman's creations</i>
<i>must live on!</i>

00:04:15.856 --> 00:04:20.560
<i>And with it,</i>
<i>a new form of life itself.</i>

00:05:21.956 --> 00:05:23.124
Master Splinter
has given us

00:05:23.257 --> 00:05:25.625
a very important mission
for tonight.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:27.061
The target
is across the street.

00:05:27.194 --> 00:05:29.096
We must use stealth
and cunning

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.731
to infiltrate the human world
and retrieve...

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:34.034
...Go-GURT.

00:05:34.168 --> 00:05:35.970
Go-GURT...
Okay, Batman.

00:05:36.103 --> 00:05:38.372
I'm just trying
to hype you guys up.
Give me that list.

00:05:38.506 --> 00:05:41.108
What else are we getting?
Four quarts of nonfat milk...
Nice.

00:05:41.242 --> 00:05:43.110
...ice cream,
fruits and veggies...

00:05:43.244 --> 00:05:46.514
...and a party-size bag
of Cool Ranch Doritos.
I like cheese puffs.

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:49.316
He was very specific about the party size.
He underlined it twice.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.051
Donnie,
you're on toiletries.
Got it.

00:05:51.185 --> 00:05:53.020
Raph, you're stocking
up the pantry.

00:05:53.154 --> 00:05:54.687
Mikey,
you're on junk food.
Yessirski.

00:05:54.822 --> 00:05:58.959
And remember-- don't let
any human see you.
Because why?

00:05:59.093 --> 00:06:01.562
"Humans are
the demon scum of the earth.

00:06:01.694 --> 00:06:03.497
Avoid them, don't say hi.

00:06:03.631 --> 00:06:06.133
They lust to murder that
which is different from them.

00:06:06.267 --> 00:06:08.068
To interact with them
is to die."

00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:10.171
And hey, I know that's
objectively prejudiced,

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:12.039
but that's what
Dad taught us.

00:06:12.173 --> 00:06:14.608
Uh, I think humans
seem kind of cool,
to be honest. Beyoncé...

00:06:14.741 --> 00:06:17.744
We wouldn't have K-pop
without humans.
Drake. The GOAT of all time.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.712
I would love to have brunch
with Tom Brady.

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:23.017
Guy Fieri seems like a fun hang.
And I've always wanted
to go to Flavortown.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.053
Look, we all think
humans are cool,
but we got a job to do.

00:06:26.187 --> 00:06:27.521
Let's go!

00:06:27.655 --> 00:06:29.523
"Let's go, I'm Leo."
"I'm the leader."

00:06:29.657 --> 00:06:31.225
You sound like
you have bronchitis.

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:31.218
<i>Terror strikes the heart</i>
<i>of Manhattan yet again today</i>

00:07:31.352 --> 00:07:33.821
<i>with another brazen</i>
<i>and deadly heist.</i>

00:07:33.954 --> 00:07:35.522
<i>An industrial-grade</i>
<i>power converter</i>

00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:36.724
<i>was stolen mid-transport.</i>

00:07:36.857 --> 00:07:38.259
<i>Police fear it's connected</i>

00:07:38.392 --> 00:07:40.527
<i>with a recent string</i>
<i>of other deadly thefts.</i>

00:07:40.661 --> 00:07:41.996
<i>New Yorkers live in fear.</i>

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:43.998
<i>Parents citywide</i>
<i>are calling for a curfew</i>

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:45.466
<i>until the criminal is caught.</i>

00:07:45.599 --> 00:07:48.335
<i>But the only lead is</i>
<i>a mysterious mastermind</i>

00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:52.006
<i>known on the streets</i>
<i>as Superfly.</i>

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:53.607
Not bad.

00:07:53.741 --> 00:07:54.942
Heading home
on a good note.

00:07:55.075 --> 00:07:56.577
Get these groceries back--
Whoa, what?

00:07:56.710 --> 00:07:59.280
We've been out for an hour.
Come on, let's stay out.

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:01.548
Come on. We said we weren't
gonna do this anymore.

00:08:01.682 --> 00:08:04.118
Last week was
Madison Square Garden
to watch the Knicks.

00:08:04.251 --> 00:08:06.086
The week before that
was the Adele concert.

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:08.289
She hit them notes
like crazy!
It was transcending!

00:08:08.422 --> 00:08:10.491
Splinter's gonna catch on.
We're gonna get grounded.

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:13.427
He's a shut-in.
He doesn't know how long
it takes to do things.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.964
For all he knows,
it takes us three hours
to get to the bodega.

00:08:17.097 --> 00:08:18.999
We told him we wouldn't
mess around anymore.

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:21.135
There's an outdoor movie night
in Brooklyn.

00:08:21.268 --> 00:08:23.871
Yeah. I hope it's a funny one.
I hope it's violent.

00:08:24.004 --> 00:08:25.773
You need to chill out, Raph.

00:08:25.906 --> 00:08:27.641
Stop moping, Leo. Let's go!

00:08:27.775 --> 00:08:30.110
Fine. Wait up!

00:08:34.014 --> 00:08:36.350
- Oh, snap.
- That vest is a choice.

00:08:36.483 --> 00:08:38.085
I wish I had hair like that.

00:08:38.218 --> 00:08:39.953
I wish
I had hair, period.

00:08:40.087 --> 00:08:42.923
We did go bald at a young age.
Is this high school,
like, in real life?

00:08:43.057 --> 00:08:45.993
Yeah, you go to high school,
you can just hijack a parade
whenever you want.

00:08:46.126 --> 00:08:50.431
Yeah. Can you imagine that?
Yeah, I'm totally
not jealous at all.

00:08:56.236 --> 00:08:59.973
Do it! Do it!

00:09:00.107 --> 00:09:02.309
Eh. Maybe one day
everyone will love us

00:09:02.443 --> 00:09:04.078
like everyone loves
Ferris Bueller.

00:09:04.211 --> 00:09:07.448
Yeah. Yeah, you know,
maybe one day.

00:09:09.083 --> 00:09:11.051
Let's get home, guys.

00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:32.406
Guys, let's go.

00:09:47.154 --> 00:09:50.391
I love being young
and free to go places!

00:10:05.539 --> 00:10:07.842
- Everybody be quiet.
- You be quiet.

00:10:07.975 --> 00:10:11.412
I'm literally whispering.
I cannot be more quiet.

00:10:11.545 --> 00:10:13.781
- I'll make white noises.
- Mikey, stop.

00:10:13.914 --> 00:10:15.516
Shh.
Dude, that makes it louder.

00:10:16.617 --> 00:10:17.886
Boys, where have you been?

00:10:18.018 --> 00:10:20.254
I've been freaking out!
We're sorry, Dad. Listen...

00:10:20.387 --> 00:10:22.189
It was this one thing--

00:10:22.322 --> 00:10:24.958
It was this cat, and you know
I'm scared of cats, so...

00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:27.027
- Yeah, the cat.
- Wait a second.

00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:29.864
You said you would go shopping,
then come right back.

00:10:29.997 --> 00:10:31.565
- Where were you?
- Uh...

00:10:31.698 --> 00:10:33.734
The cat was--
We're sorry, Splinter.

00:10:33.868 --> 00:10:37.204
The guys wanted to see a movie.
I tried to talk 'em out of it.
Leo!

00:10:37.337 --> 00:10:41.308
What? You watch a movie
with the humans? Ugh!

00:10:41.442 --> 00:10:42.811
- You ratted us out.
- Hey.

00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.378
Don't use that word that way.

00:10:44.511 --> 00:10:46.815
I mean, it's 2023.
Sorry, Dad.

00:10:46.947 --> 00:10:48.315
It wasn't that big a deal!

00:10:48.449 --> 00:10:50.784
We just watched a movie
and came back! We're fine!

00:10:50.919 --> 00:10:52.486
Hmm.

00:10:52.619 --> 00:10:54.221
You forgot, huh?

00:10:54.354 --> 00:10:58.292
You don't remember why human
are disgusting monsters?

00:10:58.425 --> 00:10:59.626
Why they're dangerous?

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.830
Why they're gonna milk us
for our blood?

00:11:01.962 --> 00:11:04.531
We don't even have nipples!

00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:07.836
I'm gonna
tell the story again.
I get a year older every time.

00:11:07.968 --> 00:11:10.537
Just for that,
I tell you the long version.

00:11:10.671 --> 00:11:13.106
No, no, no!

00:11:14.475 --> 00:11:17.611
<i>It all started 15 years ago.</i>

00:11:17.744 --> 00:11:20.849
<i>I was young rat in my 20s.</i>

00:11:20.981 --> 00:11:25.152
<i>Look at me! I was so cute.</i>
<i>I was on top of the world.</i>

00:11:25.285 --> 00:11:29.490
<i>No, I was the bottom of</i>
<i>the world. It was terrible!</i>

00:11:29.623 --> 00:11:32.493
<i>Nobody liked me.</i>
<i>I had no friends.</i>

00:11:32.626 --> 00:11:36.196
<i>Raccoons didn't like me.</i>
<i>Dogs don't like me.</i>

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.933
<i>You know who hate me the most?</i>
<i>Humans!</i>

00:11:40.534 --> 00:11:42.736
<i>I had one friend.</i>
<i>He was a cockroach.</i>

00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:45.974
<i>We got along very well.</i>
<i>His name was Kevin.</i>

00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:49.243
<i>And then I ate him.</i>

00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:53.180
<i>One day,</i>

00:11:54.715 --> 00:11:56.283
<i>everything changed.</i>

00:12:13.968 --> 00:12:16.603
<i>You was the first things I met</i>

00:12:16.737 --> 00:12:19.640
<i>that didn't want to kill me</i>
<i>or eat me.</i>

00:12:21.208 --> 00:12:23.377
<i>I couldn't</i>
<i>just leave you there.</i>

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.679
<i>You was covered in this wooze</i>

00:12:25.813 --> 00:12:28.115
<i>that someone dump</i>
<i>in the sewers.</i>

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:31.184
<i>Whatever this wooze was,</i>

00:12:31.318 --> 00:12:33.420
<i>it transformed us.</i>

00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:44.966
<i>Because I was older,</i>
<i>I became older rat man.</i>

00:12:46.333 --> 00:12:47.534
<i>You guys was babies,</i>

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.337
<i>so you stayed</i>
<i>baby turtle creatures.</i>

00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:53.007
<i>If you think about that,</i>
<i>it couldn't make more sense.</i>

00:12:55.242 --> 00:12:58.278
<i>It was weird,</i>
<i>but we became a family.</i>

00:13:11.758 --> 00:13:13.861
Whoa!
Oh!

00:13:50.797 --> 00:13:53.400
<i>You were obsessed</i>
<i>with the human world.</i>

00:13:53.533 --> 00:13:55.702
<i>So I decide to give a shot.</i>

00:14:07.247 --> 00:14:09.549
Wow!

00:14:15.923 --> 00:14:17.825
Wow!

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.165
Oh, I am so sorry.
Excuse me.

00:14:25.298 --> 00:14:26.466
Uh...

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.935
<i>It didn't go well.</i>

00:14:28.069 --> 00:14:29.369
Oh, my God, it's a rat man!

00:14:29.503 --> 00:14:30.504
Rat man?

00:14:30.637 --> 00:14:32.205
Everybody, look! It's a rat man!

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.909
It's not a rat man, it's just
a bad Mickey Mouse costume.

00:14:35.043 --> 00:14:36.710
It's real! I touched it!

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:39.981
You rat!

00:14:40.114 --> 00:14:41.615
Kill the rat man!

00:14:42.150 --> 00:14:44.251
Boys!

00:14:44.685 --> 00:14:45.719
Mikey!

00:15:01.836 --> 00:15:04.005
Look, there he is!
That's not a cat. It's a rat!

00:15:04.138 --> 00:15:07.708
<i>That day I promised</i>
<i>to never let you get hurt,</i>

00:15:07.842 --> 00:15:08.775
<i>ever again.</i>

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.410
<i>I needed to find a way</i>

00:15:10.544 --> 00:15:13.480
<i>to unlock ancient secrets</i>
<i>of ninjutsu.</i>

00:15:13.613 --> 00:15:17.151
<i>How to turn a body</i>
<i>into a weapon of death.</i>

00:15:17.284 --> 00:15:18.285
<i>And I found it.</i>

00:15:52.686 --> 00:15:55.422
♪ <i>I'm a ninja</i> ♪

00:15:56.790 --> 00:15:58.926
We thought we needed
the human world,

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:00.895
but we only needed each other.

00:16:01.028 --> 00:16:03.563
That's why I'm so strict,
you know?

00:16:03.697 --> 00:16:06.234
You boys are all I got.

00:16:06.366 --> 00:16:08.635
And you're all I'll ever have.

00:16:08.769 --> 00:16:10.604
You don't know that.
I do!

00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:13.941
You know other mutants my age?
It's a really small pool.

00:16:14.075 --> 00:16:16.376
There's no app to meet
other mutant ladies.

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.311
Trust me.
I check every day.

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:19.613
Yeah.
That's true.

00:16:19.746 --> 00:16:22.083
Look, I really don't
want to do this.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.819
No leave the sewer
for one month.

00:16:24.952 --> 00:16:26.787
- Seriously?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:29.289
I made up my mind.
That's it. I'm done.

00:16:29.422 --> 00:16:30.757
This sucks!

00:16:31.758 --> 00:16:34.461
Hey, Raph, come on.
Shut up, Leo.

00:16:36.831 --> 00:16:38.199
Mikey.

00:16:38.331 --> 00:16:40.634
Was it worth it,
Mr. Leader?

00:16:53.513 --> 00:16:54.982
Hey, guys?

00:16:55.116 --> 00:16:57.484
If we weren't monsters
that were shunned by society

00:16:57.617 --> 00:17:00.353
and could actually do
what we wanted,

00:17:00.487 --> 00:17:02.089
what would you guys do?

00:17:02.223 --> 00:17:05.092
I mean, if I'm being honest,
I'd just be normal. You know?

00:17:05.226 --> 00:17:07.261
Yeah, like go to high school.

00:17:07.394 --> 00:17:09.130
Maybe get a girlfriend,
go to prom.

00:17:09.263 --> 00:17:12.166
With your rizz, not likely.
I just gotta get out
of this sewer, man.

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:15.136
I like you guys and all,
but I simply cannot
live a happy life

00:17:15.269 --> 00:17:18.072
knowing that your faces
are the last things
I'm gonna see before I die.

00:17:18.206 --> 00:17:21.508
Well, uh, guess what, guys?
It's never gonna happen, so,

00:17:21.641 --> 00:17:23.610
let's stop talking about it,
all right?

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:37.724
All right, focus up.

00:17:37.859 --> 00:17:39.793
The truck containing
the radioactive storage unit

00:17:39.927 --> 00:17:41.128
is one minute out.

00:17:42.429 --> 00:17:43.865
Copy that.

00:17:44.832 --> 00:17:46.366
Let's not
mess this up, guys.

00:17:46.499 --> 00:17:48.169
Superfly doesn't
take kindly to errors.

00:17:48.302 --> 00:17:50.670
Any idea what he's building
with all this weird equipment?

00:17:50.805 --> 00:17:54.008
Who cares? As long as
the check clears, am I right?

00:17:57.711 --> 00:17:59.146
Target's approaching.

00:18:09.689 --> 00:18:11.325
Sixty seconds
till police response.

00:18:21.202 --> 00:18:23.570
Thirty seconds. We got to move.

00:18:25.672 --> 00:18:28.475
Huh?

00:18:28.608 --> 00:18:30.443
Let's not get carried away.

00:18:30.577 --> 00:18:32.914
Hey, hey, hey, everybody,
just keep your cool!

00:18:36.250 --> 00:18:37.751
Cops!

00:18:44.724 --> 00:18:46.060
Guys, there's no way
out of this.

00:18:46.193 --> 00:18:48.561
What are we gonna do?
Superfly's gonna kill us!

00:18:48.695 --> 00:18:51.698
In pursuit of suspects.
Moving south on Broadway.

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:55.136
Whoa, whoa. What?

00:19:09.317 --> 00:19:10.351
Huh?

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:13.620
Oh, man, what is this place?

00:19:17.291 --> 00:19:20.361
Dear God, is that...
That's-- He's--

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:22.129
You really are...

00:19:22.629 --> 00:19:24.198
Superfly.

00:19:49.957 --> 00:19:53.160
It happened again.
One of our trucks got hit.

00:19:53.294 --> 00:19:55.930
They stole a radioactive
storage unit this time.

00:19:57.497 --> 00:19:58.966
<i>Flying ice cream?</i>

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:01.501
<i>Another robbery today</i>
<i>in midtown Manhattan.</i>

00:20:01.634 --> 00:20:04.038
<i>New Yorkers were stunned.</i>

00:20:08.708 --> 00:20:12.446
Put tracking devices
on all shipments.

00:20:12.579 --> 00:20:16.783
It's time we met
this Superfly.

00:20:18.518 --> 00:20:20.287
Yeah, lob it up.
Lob it up.

00:20:20.421 --> 00:20:22.323
Stay still. Stay still.

00:20:22.456 --> 00:20:24.125
Now, now, now!

00:20:26.127 --> 00:20:27.995
That is sick, dude!
That is awesome!

00:20:28.129 --> 00:20:30.831
Come on, guys,
we just got ungrounded,
all right? Let's go home.

00:20:30.965 --> 00:20:33.134
Leo, can I ask you a question?
What, Raph?

00:20:33.267 --> 00:20:35.936
Is it weird to have your head
so far up Dad's butt?

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.570
Does it smell weird
up there?

00:20:37.704 --> 00:20:39.773
I bet it smells like
cheese and Doritos.

00:20:39.907 --> 00:20:41.876
Ha-ha-ha, guys. Very funny!

00:20:42.009 --> 00:20:43.244
Sorry, we can't hear you.

00:20:43.377 --> 00:20:45.413
Your voice is too muffled
through the cheese.

00:20:45.545 --> 00:20:47.248
Try that
Batman voice again.

00:20:47.381 --> 00:20:49.083
Yo, check this out
in slo-mo.

00:20:50.351 --> 00:20:52.719
That's the coolest thing
I've ever seen.
Whoa! Yeah!

00:20:52.853 --> 00:20:54.554
That's cool.
Hey, let's try that again

00:20:54.687 --> 00:20:56.891
but with ninja stars.

00:20:57.024 --> 00:21:00.127
Okay, eye of the tiger, Raph.
Focus up, come on.

00:21:00.261 --> 00:21:03.531
You're good.
Guys, uh, do I have to be
the one to hold this?

00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:05.299
Yes. Who else
is gonna do it, Mikey?

00:21:05.433 --> 00:21:08.601
Don't worry about it, Mikey.
You're fine. Chill.

00:21:08.735 --> 00:21:10.071
He's gonna die.

00:21:10.204 --> 00:21:13.074
Why did we pick a fruit
shaped exactly like my head?

00:21:13.207 --> 00:21:15.675
Your head looks like Stewie
had a baby with "Hey, Arnold."

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.745
Stop talking! You're
ruining my concentration.

00:21:18.879 --> 00:21:20.214
All right, Raph.

00:21:20.347 --> 00:21:21.816
Three, two...

00:21:25.585 --> 00:21:27.221
Did you hear that?
What was that?

00:21:40.468 --> 00:21:41.969
Hey! You on the roof!

00:21:42.103 --> 00:21:44.805
You just hit me in the head
with a ninja star.

00:21:44.939 --> 00:21:46.907
What's her deal?
She's yelling at us a lot.

00:21:47.041 --> 00:21:49.310
I think she's mad that
we hit her with the ninja star.

00:21:49.443 --> 00:21:52.745
Maybe we should go down
and talk to her.
You know, check in on her?

00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.049
"Can we go down there?"
What's your pickup line?

00:21:55.182 --> 00:21:58.618
No, don't sidebar. Huh?
This is one of the most--

00:21:58.751 --> 00:22:00.221
I think that guy's
helping her.

00:22:00.354 --> 00:22:02.490
Uh, I think
he's stealing her scooter.

00:22:02.622 --> 00:22:06.460
Hey, lady, behind you!
We just need to
skip the conversation.

00:22:06.594 --> 00:22:09.130
No, your scooter!
You owe me money!

00:22:10.231 --> 00:22:12.799
- Hey! What are you doing?
- He's getting away.

00:22:14.835 --> 00:22:16.804
We tried to warn her.
Nothing more we can do.

00:22:16.937 --> 00:22:18.339
You guys want
to grab pizza?

00:22:18.472 --> 00:22:20.707
No. She got her scooter stolen,
and it's our fault.

00:22:20.841 --> 00:22:25.045
We have to fix this.
Yeah, that sucks, but
do we have to fix this?

00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:27.948
Technically, she was
just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

00:22:28.082 --> 00:22:30.351
It's not really our fault.
I gotta get the scooter back

00:22:30.484 --> 00:22:32.719
to this beautiful
and charming human woman!

00:22:32.853 --> 00:22:34.388
Alpha formation, go!

00:22:34.522 --> 00:22:37.024
Whoa. I think
all of his hormones
just kicked in at once.

00:22:37.158 --> 00:22:38.192
Follow him!

00:22:40.895 --> 00:22:43.931
Hey!
Who was that?

00:22:48.002 --> 00:22:49.236
All right, guys.
Guard the exits.

00:22:49.370 --> 00:22:51.438
We're gonna need
the most foolproof plan.

00:22:51.572 --> 00:22:54.575
Every single ninja technique.
I need you to use stealth
to block the doors and--

00:22:54.707 --> 00:22:56.277
Did you say go loud?
Whoo-hoo!

00:22:56.410 --> 00:22:57.912
Raph! Raph!
Oh, oh.

00:22:58.045 --> 00:22:59.679
- Whoo-hoo!
- Raph! Raph!

00:22:59.813 --> 00:23:01.048
Whoo.

00:23:01.182 --> 00:23:03.651
That's a lot of guys.

00:23:03.783 --> 00:23:05.386
They look really mean.

00:23:06.187 --> 00:23:08.155
What the heck are those things?

00:23:08.289 --> 00:23:10.424
I think it's those guys
that work in Times Square.

00:23:10.558 --> 00:23:13.160
You know, the mascots?
Yeah, the GEICO geckos.

00:23:13.294 --> 00:23:15.095
They look more like
little Shreks to me.

00:23:15.229 --> 00:23:17.730
This is fine.
We've prepared our
whole lives for this.

00:23:17.865 --> 00:23:19.400
We've never been
in a fight before.

00:23:19.533 --> 00:23:22.036
I don't know if you noticed,
all I've got is a big stick.

00:23:22.169 --> 00:23:23.736
How did I end up
with a big stick?

00:23:23.871 --> 00:23:25.172
Maybe we diffuse this
sitch with laughter.

00:23:25.306 --> 00:23:26.773
You're not funny enough
for that.

00:23:26.907 --> 00:23:28.542
Enough talk! I dream
about fighting every night.

00:23:28.676 --> 00:23:31.711
You've got
a rage problem, Raph.
It's not a problem!

00:23:31.845 --> 00:23:32.846
Whoo!

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:34.348
Rogue sai!

00:23:36.850 --> 00:23:38.718
Oh, my God!

00:23:38.852 --> 00:23:40.154
Oh, my--
I'm gonna be sick.

00:23:40.287 --> 00:23:42.423
It's still in my leg!
Mikey, watch out!

00:23:44.458 --> 00:23:46.994
Okay, we're not off
to a great start, guys.

00:23:50.364 --> 00:23:53.701
Maybe they'll see the humanity
in our tragic backstory.

00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:55.402
Murder the Shreks!

00:23:55.536 --> 00:23:57.438
They don't see it.
They don't see it.

00:23:57.571 --> 00:23:59.640
Think fast, Leo!
What are you doing?

00:23:59.772 --> 00:24:01.942
Huh?
Whoo!

00:24:02.775 --> 00:24:04.144
All right, Raph, you go left,

00:24:04.278 --> 00:24:05.212
I go--

00:24:06.247 --> 00:24:08.482
What the heck?
I said go left!

00:24:08.616 --> 00:24:10.150
I got him!

00:24:11.685 --> 00:24:13.053
Mikey, watch out!

00:24:16.590 --> 00:24:18.492
Too slow! Psych!

00:24:30.004 --> 00:24:31.672
Dang, that's loud.

00:24:33.941 --> 00:24:36.310
Back off! I've got
a big stick!

00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.149
Shrek, you want to die?

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:45.019
What the--

00:24:45.819 --> 00:24:47.221
Sorry, sorry.
You'll pay for that!

00:24:50.758 --> 00:24:53.193
Ow! Quit throwing stuff
at me!

00:24:54.895 --> 00:24:56.297
What do we do?

00:24:56.430 --> 00:24:59.133
Save the beautiful
human woman's scooter!

00:25:01.502 --> 00:25:02.469
Uh-oh.

00:25:03.504 --> 00:25:05.172
Eat that, no crumbs!

00:25:12.012 --> 00:25:13.480
Okay, chill out!

00:25:16.784 --> 00:25:18.886
Mikey, watch out!

00:25:23.791 --> 00:25:25.959
He's Tokyo drifting
around us.

00:25:34.835 --> 00:25:36.036
I'm awesome.

00:25:36.170 --> 00:25:38.172
- Aw, nice!
- Yeah, Raph!

00:25:41.642 --> 00:25:43.477
Guys, look around!

00:25:47.981 --> 00:25:50.984
We did it!
We did that!
I totally helped.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.121
Hide, hide, hide.

00:25:55.723 --> 00:26:00.160
Hello,
I'm an unarmed noncombatant
here for her scooter.

00:26:00.294 --> 00:26:01.295
Whoa.

00:26:01.995 --> 00:26:03.464
Y'all got your butts
whupped.

00:26:07.968 --> 00:26:11.505
This is really not
how I thought this night
was gonna go.

00:26:12.740 --> 00:26:14.541
Wait.
Where'd you guys go?

00:26:14.675 --> 00:26:15.976
Hey.

00:26:17.644 --> 00:26:19.546
Hey, I see you in there.

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:20.849
I think she can see us.

00:26:20.981 --> 00:26:22.516
She can't.
She totally can!

00:26:22.649 --> 00:26:24.485
I won't make a big deal
about the ninja star.

00:26:24.618 --> 00:26:27.354
You got my scooter back so I
feel like that's square. Um...

00:26:27.488 --> 00:26:29.923
Donnie, you go out first.
You're the most inviting
and friendly.

00:26:30.057 --> 00:26:32.226
I get that you have to huddle,

00:26:32.359 --> 00:26:35.028
but the longer you lurk
in the shadows,

00:26:35.162 --> 00:26:36.930
like, the more sus it gets
every second.

00:26:37.064 --> 00:26:39.800
She said we're sus!
That's not good.
You know? Yeah.

00:26:39.933 --> 00:26:43.737
And now it's, like,
doubly sus to be whispering
about how sus...

00:26:45.172 --> 00:26:46.473
Hey.
Wassup?

00:26:46.607 --> 00:26:47.741
Hey.

00:26:47.876 --> 00:26:50.944
Oh, you're crime-fighters
with turtle costumes.

00:26:51.078 --> 00:26:55.182
Yeah, I'm gonna be honest.
I don't think all
the good animals are taken.

00:26:55.315 --> 00:26:58.185
Sharks. Uh, there's
wolves up for grabs.

00:26:58.318 --> 00:27:00.421
Wow, the costumes
are really crazy.

00:27:00.554 --> 00:27:02.824
These eyes are wet
like real eyeballs.

00:27:02.956 --> 00:27:04.425
How do you get this
on and off?

00:27:04.558 --> 00:27:07.928
That's your skin!
She touched--
That's my skin.

00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:10.497
What are you?
What could you be?

00:27:11.965 --> 00:27:14.268
Can we explain this
over some pizza?

00:27:17.304 --> 00:27:18.972
How you guys feel
about pepperoni?

00:27:19.106 --> 00:27:21.408
She's down for pizza?
I didn't think it
would get this far.

00:27:22.609 --> 00:27:25.245
So, there's this rat...
Long ago,
in New York City...

00:27:25.379 --> 00:27:28.182
...my brothers and I...
...we were
a bunch of turtles...

00:27:30.984 --> 00:27:34.988
This is-- I don't know
where we came from.
...our dad again--

00:27:35.122 --> 00:27:37.758
Stop. Stop. Stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop!

00:27:37.892 --> 00:27:41.128
Okay, you were
real baby turtles

00:27:41.261 --> 00:27:44.665
who made contact
with mystery ooze,

00:27:44.798 --> 00:27:48.302
and therefore started to age

00:27:48.435 --> 00:27:53.674
from mutant baby turtles
to mutant-turtle-men-guys?

00:27:53.808 --> 00:27:55.409
Uh, turtle boys, actually.

00:27:55.542 --> 00:27:58.345
I would say teens.
I would say cool teens.
Yeah, we're cool.

00:27:58.479 --> 00:28:02.182
Teenagers! Amazing. Insane.
All right, well, tell me more.

00:28:02.316 --> 00:28:05.118
Obviously, I want to know
everything about you.

00:28:05.252 --> 00:28:08.589
Like, is there more of you?

00:28:08.722 --> 00:28:09.924
Nope, just us.

00:28:10.057 --> 00:28:12.025
"They are alone
in the world."

00:28:12.159 --> 00:28:14.695
And nobody's ever
asked you about this

00:28:14.829 --> 00:28:16.296
or talked to you about this?

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:18.065
I know, right?
No, not really.

00:28:18.198 --> 00:28:20.334
Sometimes we pretend to be on
<i>Wendy Williams,</i>  but that's it.

00:28:20.467 --> 00:28:21.903
Why you writing
all this down?

00:28:22.035 --> 00:28:24.839
Oh. I'm a journalist.
Well, I want to be a journalist.

00:28:24.973 --> 00:28:26.373
I write for my school paper.

00:28:26.507 --> 00:28:27.441
Really?

00:28:27.574 --> 00:28:29.376
I assumed you'd want
to be on camera,

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.045
'cause you have
a very camera-ready look.

00:28:32.179 --> 00:28:35.115
Nope. No.
Never on camera.
Okay.

00:28:35.249 --> 00:28:38.987
I'm down here researching
this story on Superfly
and his string of super crimes.

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:43.190
The police have been talking
about implementing this curfew
if they don't find him soon.

00:28:43.323 --> 00:28:45.292
It spooked the parents,
and they canceled prom.

00:28:45.425 --> 00:28:47.261
I'm trying to help
bring him to justice

00:28:47.394 --> 00:28:49.596
so everyone can chill out
or whatever.

00:28:49.730 --> 00:28:53.001
But this!
Turtle mutant karate teens.

00:28:53.133 --> 00:28:55.335
I mean,
this is a pretty good story.

00:28:55.469 --> 00:28:57.471
Look, I don't know
if we should.

00:28:57.604 --> 00:29:01.475
Why not? This is gold!
This is so good!

00:29:01.608 --> 00:29:03.544
We were taught that humans
would try to destroy us

00:29:03.677 --> 00:29:05.345
if they ever found out
we ever existed.

00:29:05.479 --> 00:29:07.815
You know, kill us,
or put us in a lab and milk us.

00:29:07.949 --> 00:29:10.852
I wouldn't milk you.
You don't even have nipples.

00:29:10.985 --> 00:29:12.954
Look, human woman,
I got a question.

00:29:13.086 --> 00:29:15.322
So just be straight with me.

00:29:15.455 --> 00:29:18.125
Do you think there are
more people like you?

00:29:18.258 --> 00:29:20.929
You know, people
who will accept us?

00:29:24.698 --> 00:29:26.300
No. No, absolutely not.

00:29:26.433 --> 00:29:28.669
Um, genuinely, no.
There's no way.

00:29:28.803 --> 00:29:31.271
I knew it!
It's confirmed.
We're doomed.

00:29:31.405 --> 00:29:32.406
Wait, wait, wait.

00:29:32.539 --> 00:29:34.474
If I'm being honest...

00:29:34.608 --> 00:29:38.745
I mean, the reason I'm not
scared of you is, you know,
you guys helped me out.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.080
And if you hadn't,

00:29:40.213 --> 00:29:43.017
and I had just, like,
stumbled across you,

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:44.751
yeah, I'd be very scared.

00:29:44.886 --> 00:29:48.056
I'd be really, um,
freaked out and disgusted.

00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:50.591
Sorry, my mom is texting.

00:29:50.724 --> 00:29:53.027
Dad is texting us!
He's freaking out a bit.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.362
Well, at least
all parents are the same.

00:29:55.495 --> 00:29:57.631
A hundred percent.
Yeah, for sure.

00:29:57.764 --> 00:30:00.500
Our dad is definitely not
a giant rat.

00:30:01.234 --> 00:30:03.337
That makes me feel
like he's a rat.

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.672
Well, I'll AirDrop you
my contact,

00:30:05.807 --> 00:30:07.274
and if you ever feel like

00:30:07.407 --> 00:30:09.944
you want to come out
into the world or whatever,

00:30:10.078 --> 00:30:11.445
just let me know.

00:30:11.578 --> 00:30:14.114
I would love to write
a story about it, seriously.

00:30:14.247 --> 00:30:15.883
Good night.

00:30:17.284 --> 00:30:18.352
She seemed cool.

00:30:18.485 --> 00:30:19.786
Here he goes again.
Every girl, man.

00:30:19.921 --> 00:30:21.889
That's your type?
Give me that contact.

00:30:22.023 --> 00:30:25.258
Give me that contact! Please.
Give me the phone!

00:30:26.793 --> 00:30:28.462
It was sick!

00:30:28.595 --> 00:30:31.298
I mean, you guys saw it.
I was, like, wow!

00:30:31.431 --> 00:30:33.166
I want more, guys.

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.903
I got the taste of life,
and I don't want to
wash it out of my mouth.

00:30:36.037 --> 00:30:38.739
I want it to linger
on my tongue,
swish around my throat and--

00:30:38.873 --> 00:30:41.042
You're really driving
this metaphor into the ground.

00:30:41.174 --> 00:30:43.811
But he's right.
I mean, it was too good
to give up on.

00:30:43.945 --> 00:30:46.213
You guys heard April
and the words that came out

00:30:46.346 --> 00:30:48.682
of her incredibly formed
and beautiful mouth.

00:30:48.816 --> 00:30:52.319
The only reason she liked us
was because we saved her.
She saw us as heroes.

00:30:52.452 --> 00:30:56.090
- So, what if everyone saw us as heroes?
-  What do you mean?

00:30:56.223 --> 00:30:58.191
I mean, look!

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.930
We use our ninja skills
to take out Superfly.

00:31:03.064 --> 00:31:04.498
<i>We'll drag him up to City Hall,</i>

00:31:04.631 --> 00:31:07.234
<i>dump him on the steps</i>
<i>for the cops and say,</i>

00:31:07.367 --> 00:31:09.269
<i>"We're the heroes</i>
<i>who stopped Superfly!</i>

00:31:09.403 --> 00:31:12.106
<i>Yeah, we look</i>
<i>a little different,</i>
<i>but we're on your side."</i>

00:31:12.239 --> 00:31:13.573
<i>Everyone will be like,</i>

00:31:13.707 --> 00:31:15.509
<i>"Hey, those 'toitles'</i>
<i>are all right.</i>

00:31:15.642 --> 00:31:17.111
<i>I'm a cabbie from the Bronx."</i>

00:31:17.244 --> 00:31:19.413
<i>Then everyone in the city</i>
<i>will think we're cool.</i>

00:31:19.546 --> 00:31:21.348
<i>They'll accept us.</i>

00:31:21.481 --> 00:31:23.283
<i>"Sign my baby!"</i>

00:31:23.417 --> 00:31:26.054
<i>And then,</i>
<i>once the overall fanfare</i>
<i>has settled down,</i>

00:31:26.186 --> 00:31:28.956
<i>we'll enroll in high school,</i>
<i>where we'll be normal--</i>

00:31:29.090 --> 00:31:32.559
<i>if not slightly more popular</i>
<i>than average-- students.</i>

00:31:32.693 --> 00:31:34.461
Okay,
I'm following this.

00:31:34.594 --> 00:31:36.296
It's like Hulk
in  <i>Avengers: Endgame.</i>

00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:38.465
Sure, he's a giant,
terrifying green monster,

00:31:38.598 --> 00:31:40.300
but everyone knows
he saved them,

00:31:40.434 --> 00:31:42.569
so they're taking selfies
with him in a diner.

00:31:42.703 --> 00:31:44.839
You know Mark Ruffalo
mostly improvised that scene?

00:31:44.972 --> 00:31:48.076
I know.
He's good on his feet.
Nobody cares about that, okay?

00:31:48.208 --> 00:31:49.643
This is a great plan.

00:31:49.776 --> 00:31:51.511
If this works,
I won't have to hang
with you losers

00:31:51.645 --> 00:31:53.014
for the rest of my life.

00:31:53.147 --> 00:31:54.448
Yeah.
Yeah! That's very true.

00:31:54.581 --> 00:31:56.383
Uh, what about Dad,
though?

00:31:56.516 --> 00:31:59.653
I mean, he doesn't really
need to know about it.

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:01.354
Right?

00:32:02.622 --> 00:32:05.093
Look, if we're gonna do this,
we'll have to get April's help.

00:32:05.225 --> 00:32:08.029
Sounds like she's been doing
tons of research on Superfly.

00:32:08.162 --> 00:32:09.429
She probably has
some good leads.

00:32:09.563 --> 00:32:13.567
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.769
So you're in?
Yeah, I'm in.

00:32:17.038 --> 00:32:20.340
Let's go!
We did it, Mikey!

00:32:22.176 --> 00:32:23.777
Hello? Turtle-- Fellas.

00:32:23.911 --> 00:32:26.147
Uh, hey.
Is that you guys for real?

00:32:26.279 --> 00:32:27.547
<i>Hi...</i>

00:32:27.681 --> 00:32:29.616
...- April. Yes, it's...
- ...Leo!

00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:31.685
You know, we were talking...
<i>Yeah?</i>

00:32:31.819 --> 00:32:33.587
...and we have a proposal.
<i>Okay.</i>

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.455
You help us find Superfly,

00:32:35.589 --> 00:32:37.758
we bring him to justice,
you document it all,

00:32:37.892 --> 00:32:41.361
and when we got him,
you release the story,
your prom is uncanceled,

00:32:41.495 --> 00:32:43.363
and we get accepted
by the world as heroes.

00:32:43.497 --> 00:32:45.265
<i>Wow. Yes. Uh, yeah.</i>

00:32:45.398 --> 00:32:47.467
Okay.
Sure. I mean...

00:32:47.601 --> 00:32:48.702
...if I'm being honest,

00:32:48.836 --> 00:32:51.038
I totally stopped
thinking about this.

00:32:51.172 --> 00:32:53.273
I had a lot of things to do.

00:32:53.406 --> 00:32:55.575
By the way,
do you guys have ears?

00:32:55.709 --> 00:32:58.880
Just say yes,
just say yes.
I think so?

00:32:59.013 --> 00:33:01.015
They think they have ears.

00:33:01.149 --> 00:33:02.516
Okay, perfect. Yes.

00:33:02.649 --> 00:33:05.086
<i>Um, how about we meet tonight,</i>
<i>8:00 p.m., Eastman High.</i>

00:33:05.219 --> 00:33:08.722
<i>Everyone will be gone,</i>
<i>and I've got all my research</i>
<i>in the school darkroom.</i>

00:33:08.856 --> 00:33:11.826
Cool. Cool.
So, uh, it's a date.

00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:13.293
Wait, what?

00:33:13.426 --> 00:33:16.030
No, no, just hang up.
Just hang up.

00:33:16.164 --> 00:33:17.832
You know what?

00:33:17.965 --> 00:33:20.868
It's like bad service
or something.
I'll see you tonight!

00:33:21.768 --> 00:33:23.503
Who's got no rizz now?

00:33:24.604 --> 00:33:26.073
Sorry, Dad.
Have to leave now.

00:33:26.207 --> 00:33:29.676
Heading out!
Love you so much. Love you.
Goodbye. Kisses!

00:33:30.343 --> 00:33:32.113
What are they up to?

00:33:50.131 --> 00:33:51.265
Whoo-hoo!

00:33:51.398 --> 00:33:52.834
- Hey!
- Hey.

00:33:52.967 --> 00:33:56.270
You actually made it.
That seemed very dangerous.

00:33:56.403 --> 00:33:58.139
Oh, that?
Ha! Not at all.

00:33:58.272 --> 00:33:59.807
I mean, we eat danger
for breakfast.

00:33:59.941 --> 00:34:02.409
Actually, I eat pizza
with bits of waffles on it.

00:34:02.542 --> 00:34:03.677
It's better than it sounds.

00:34:03.811 --> 00:34:06.180
It actually sounds
delicious, honestly.

00:34:06.314 --> 00:34:08.682
Okay, well,
uh, come on in.

00:34:08.816 --> 00:34:11.819
Really? We can
just go in there?

00:34:11.953 --> 00:34:13.553
Yeah, of course.

00:34:13.687 --> 00:34:16.790
Welcome to Eastman High.

00:34:17.757 --> 00:34:19.426
Wow.

00:34:23.797 --> 00:34:25.166
It's very strange.

00:34:25.299 --> 00:34:27.801
I feel you guys
actually want to
go to high school.

00:34:27.935 --> 00:34:30.537
Yeah, we do.
We very much do.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.439
Why? Don't you
love high school?

00:34:33.007 --> 00:34:34.008
Oh, yeah, I mean,

00:34:34.141 --> 00:34:36.409
as a very popular
and well-liked person,

00:34:36.543 --> 00:34:38.145
I love high school,
yeah.

00:34:38.279 --> 00:34:39.579
But don't worry about me.

00:34:39.713 --> 00:34:42.350
Is this living up
to your dreams?

00:34:42.482 --> 00:34:43.583
No.

00:34:43.717 --> 00:34:45.552
It's even better!
<i>Attack on Titan?</i>

00:34:45.685 --> 00:34:47.687
Whoever's locker this is
likes anime.

00:34:47.822 --> 00:34:49.023
I don't even
know this person,

00:34:49.156 --> 00:34:50.925
and they get me more
than anyone ever has!

00:34:51.058 --> 00:34:55.528
Guys, look!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Improv team tryouts!

00:34:55.662 --> 00:34:57.664
I've got to sign up.
This is amazing!

00:34:57.797 --> 00:34:59.633
Mikey, what are you--
We don't even go here.
Yet.

00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:01.168
The tryouts aren't
for two weeks.

00:35:01.302 --> 00:35:02.402
We could be enrolled by then.

00:35:02.535 --> 00:35:04.604
They need a last name.

00:35:04.738 --> 00:35:06.374
Wait, what's our last name?

00:35:06.506 --> 00:35:08.342
I've never thought
about that, actually.

00:35:08.475 --> 00:35:10.945
Do we not have last names?
Who are we?

00:35:11.078 --> 00:35:13.347
It's okay.
I'll just break it up.

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.782
Michael Angelo.

00:35:15.917 --> 00:35:18.152
Hey, I'm Michael Angelo.

00:35:18.286 --> 00:35:19.220
Perfecto.

00:35:19.353 --> 00:35:21.022
That makes you Leo Nardo!

00:35:21.155 --> 00:35:23.456
Nardo!

00:35:23.590 --> 00:35:24.825
Hey, Nardo.
Nardo.

00:35:24.959 --> 00:35:27.361
It could be Leon Ardo.
That's a cool name.

00:35:27.494 --> 00:35:28.728
Guys, lay off Nardo.

00:35:28.863 --> 00:35:30.697
He's sensitive.

00:35:30.831 --> 00:35:32.867
She called him Nardo too.
Nardo!

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.001
Nardo!

00:35:34.135 --> 00:35:36.304
Hey, well, at least
I'm not "Puke Girl."

00:35:36.436 --> 00:35:38.005
That is a bad nickname!

00:35:38.139 --> 00:35:39.874
We don't know
if that says "Puke Girl."

00:35:40.007 --> 00:35:42.709
It could be "Poke Girl."
Maybe this girl just likes tuna.

00:35:42.843 --> 00:35:44.744
Oh, my God.
Are you Puke Girl?

00:35:44.879 --> 00:35:47.415
She's Puke Girl!
That does not say "poke."

00:35:47.547 --> 00:35:50.017
All right! Stop.
Listen.

00:35:50.151 --> 00:35:52.019
I told you,
ever since I was young,

00:35:52.153 --> 00:35:53.821
I wanted to be a journalist,
and so,

00:35:53.955 --> 00:35:56.489
I thought I could read
the morning announcements,

00:35:56.623 --> 00:35:58.359
and, you know, well,

00:35:58.491 --> 00:36:00.394
it didn't go so well.

00:36:05.632 --> 00:36:08.135
<i>I don't know. Maybe the cameras</i>
<i>and the attention got to me,</i>

00:36:08.269 --> 00:36:11.238
<i>and the anxiety made me feel</i>
<i>like I was gonna explode,</i>

00:36:11.372 --> 00:36:13.274
<i>and so, well...</i>

00:36:13.407 --> 00:36:14.275
You didn't.

00:36:14.408 --> 00:36:15.343
I did.

00:36:21.949 --> 00:36:23.951
Oh, God.

00:36:29.991 --> 00:36:31.392
I went viral.

00:36:31.524 --> 00:36:32.492
<i>I was remixed.</i>

00:36:35.062 --> 00:36:36.464
<i>Memed.</i>

00:36:36.596 --> 00:36:38.866
<i>The sound even</i>
<i>trended on TikTok.</i>

00:36:41.202 --> 00:36:43.536
I thought if I use the paper
to find Superfly

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:44.972
and get prom uncanceled,

00:36:45.106 --> 00:36:47.174
I can remain firmly
off camera,

00:36:47.308 --> 00:36:50.878
but also maybe be known for
something cool instead of--

00:36:51.012 --> 00:36:52.512
What? Being Puke Girl? Hmm?

00:36:52.645 --> 00:36:54.581
You don't want that anymore?
No?

00:36:54.714 --> 00:36:55.983
Great. Laugh. Whatever.

00:36:56.117 --> 00:36:57.617
But maybe you're not
the only ones

00:36:57.751 --> 00:37:00.388
who want to be heroes
so people like them, okay?

00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:01.822
Can we go?

00:37:10.597 --> 00:37:12.333
All right, here's what I got.

00:37:14.534 --> 00:37:17.171
Yes, yes,
it's incredibly impressive.
Okay, listen.

00:37:17.304 --> 00:37:19.306
Superfly seems to be
building something.

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:22.742
I mean, we're talking
Gru/Megamind-type stuff.

00:37:22.877 --> 00:37:26.047
He's knocking off insanely
highly technical shipments.

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.015
State of the art.
Incredibly expensive.

00:37:28.149 --> 00:37:30.017
And he pays off thugs
to do his dirty work

00:37:30.151 --> 00:37:32.585
so he can stay
completely under the radar.

00:37:32.719 --> 00:37:34.422
Nobody's ever seen his face.
Why?

00:37:34.554 --> 00:37:37.158
Because he kills
everyone who does.

00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:39.493
Whoa!
Cool.

00:37:39.626 --> 00:37:40.794
No, not cool.

00:37:40.928 --> 00:37:43.364
So how are we
gonna find him?

00:37:43.497 --> 00:37:45.698
You know the ice cream truck
heist last week, right?

00:37:45.833 --> 00:37:47.501
They stole
a radioactive storage unit.

00:37:47.634 --> 00:37:51.638
And look.
I found this at the chop shop
where they took my scooter.

00:37:51.771 --> 00:37:53.974
They must be doing business
with Superfly.

00:37:54.108 --> 00:37:56.243
That chop shop is run by
these guys and their crew.

00:37:56.377 --> 00:38:00.580
Short Sharon, Bald Bronson,
Toupee Tom and Normal Nate.

00:38:00.713 --> 00:38:03.350
They are the ones who
can lead us to Superfly.

00:38:03.484 --> 00:38:04.584
That's a lot of leads.

00:38:04.717 --> 00:38:05.986
And a lot of
terrible nicknames.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:09.356
Still better than Nardo.
We agreed on Leon Ardo.

00:38:09.490 --> 00:38:11.826
Let's start chasing them down.

00:39:41.015 --> 00:39:42.616
Normal Nate deals with that!

00:39:42.749 --> 00:39:44.451
I'm just a legitimate
mattress salesman.

00:39:44.585 --> 00:39:46.053
You want Short Sharon.

00:39:49.023 --> 00:39:51.025
Hey, I don't talk,
but if I did talk,

00:39:51.158 --> 00:39:52.993
I'd tell you
it was Bad Bernie
you were looking for.

00:39:53.127 --> 00:39:55.462
But you didn't hear it from me.
Where's Bad Bernie?

00:39:55.596 --> 00:39:57.498
Okay, I'll talk.

00:39:57.631 --> 00:39:58.832
Yeah, all right.

00:39:58.966 --> 00:40:01.602
My guys stole
this radioactive storage unit,

00:40:01.734 --> 00:40:03.504
but Superfly, he kills them.

00:40:03.637 --> 00:40:07.208
Then he calls me and says
I gotta get him another thing--

00:40:07.341 --> 00:40:08.509
an "assimilator."

00:40:08.642 --> 00:40:11.245
And if I don't do it,
he's gonna kill me too.

00:40:11.879 --> 00:40:13.480
<i>So last night we got one.</i>

00:40:15.482 --> 00:40:17.518
<i>The deal with Superfly</i>
<i>is tonight,</i>

00:40:17.651 --> 00:40:18.886
<i>under the bridge.</i>

00:40:19.453 --> 00:40:20.654
<i>We give him his unit,</i>

00:40:20.787 --> 00:40:22.990
<i>and he leaves us alone.</i>

00:40:23.457 --> 00:40:25.459
Good. You did good.

00:40:26.793 --> 00:40:28.329
Dude! He talked!

00:40:28.462 --> 00:40:30.864
That was so exhilarating!

00:40:30.998 --> 00:40:34.068
The adrenaline pumping
in my veins is crazy!

00:40:34.201 --> 00:40:37.137
Superfly is making a deal
with Bad Bernie's guys tonight,

00:40:37.271 --> 00:40:39.073
in an hour,
under the Brooklyn Bridge.

00:40:39.206 --> 00:40:41.809
We show up in Bernie's van
with the goods, and boom!

00:40:41.942 --> 00:40:43.644
Superfly is caught in our web.

00:40:43.776 --> 00:40:45.913
Did you get that, April?
Did you film that?

00:40:46.046 --> 00:40:48.382
Sorry, am I supposed to film
all the stuff you do?

00:40:48.515 --> 00:40:49.984
'Cause a lot of it's dumb.
Yes.

00:40:50.117 --> 00:40:51.252
I'll do the talking.

00:40:51.385 --> 00:40:52.720
Hey, I'm a gangster.

00:40:52.853 --> 00:40:54.021
I got my puffer and my Tims.

00:40:54.154 --> 00:40:55.956
I need my bacon,
egg and cheese too.

00:40:56.090 --> 00:40:57.391
You got the goods,
Superfly?

00:40:57.524 --> 00:40:59.326
Bacon, egg and cheese.

00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.730
Let me get that
bacon, egg and cheese.

00:41:02.863 --> 00:41:05.466
And let me get
that Arizona Iced Tea.

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:08.469
With a bev? With a bev?
Yerd!

00:41:08.602 --> 00:41:11.272
We outside. We outside.

00:41:11.405 --> 00:41:14.642
Outside. You heard.
Yerd! Yerd! Yerd!

00:41:14.774 --> 00:41:18.112
Bronx. Bronx. Yerd!

00:41:18.245 --> 00:41:21.348
Yeah, I don't think this
is gonna help people like you.

00:41:21.482 --> 00:41:22.916
Just being honest.

00:41:25.386 --> 00:41:28.322
Let me get a bacon,
egg and cheese.
Bronx. Bronx.

00:41:30.991 --> 00:41:32.960
Uh-oh, text from Dad.

00:41:35.029 --> 00:41:36.897
What do you think is wrong?

00:41:37.031 --> 00:41:39.033
I bet that cat is back.
He freaks out every time.

00:41:39.166 --> 00:41:40.768
He probably just can't
get the Roku working.

00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:42.836
Hopefully it's quick
and we can just meet up
with Superfly.

00:41:42.970 --> 00:41:44.571
All right, April,
we live just up there,

00:41:44.705 --> 00:41:47.741
but our dad,
he doesn't really
like humans.

00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:49.043
Rude.

00:41:49.176 --> 00:41:51.245
I mean, to be fair,
I don't love rats.

00:41:51.378 --> 00:41:52.980
And that's totally fair.
Understandable.

00:41:53.113 --> 00:41:56.183
But just wait here, okay?
We'll be back in a few.

00:41:57.284 --> 00:41:59.920
And there's a cockroach
surfing on a turd.

00:42:00.054 --> 00:42:01.588
Awesome. Good.

00:42:01.722 --> 00:42:03.390
Love that
I'm looking at that.

00:42:08.295 --> 00:42:09.430
Surprise!

00:42:11.231 --> 00:42:14.535
Dad, you really can't keep
scaring us like that.

00:42:14.668 --> 00:42:15.936
Welcome home!

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:18.272
Why are there balloons?
Dad, what are you doing?

00:42:18.405 --> 00:42:21.875
Look, I am not stupid.
I know something's up.

00:42:22.009 --> 00:42:24.278
You do?
I do. You're done
with the sewers.

00:42:24.411 --> 00:42:26.280
You want to be
in the human world.

00:42:26.413 --> 00:42:29.216
I went through your stuff
and I found your human clothes.

00:42:29.350 --> 00:42:31.151
What the heck is that?

00:42:31.285 --> 00:42:34.088
Those aren't ours.
How did that even
get in our stuff?

00:42:34.221 --> 00:42:35.556
Boys, it's okay.

00:42:35.689 --> 00:42:38.492
I think I maybe found a way
to make you happy.

00:42:38.625 --> 00:42:41.562
I brought the human world
to you. Look!

00:42:42.496 --> 00:42:44.898
Human friends.
"Hello, I'm a human."

00:42:45.032 --> 00:42:46.200
Say hi to Chris.

00:42:46.333 --> 00:42:48.435
"I'm Chris Pine.
Look at my eyebrows.

00:42:48.569 --> 00:42:50.904
I'm the best Chris."
Amazing, right?

00:42:51.038 --> 00:42:52.106
That is what we love.

00:42:52.239 --> 00:42:54.341
And watch. I'm a waiter.

00:42:54.475 --> 00:42:56.643
The full
human restaurant experience.

00:42:56.777 --> 00:42:58.512
Sit down.
Let me take your order.

00:42:58.645 --> 00:43:01.448
It could be anything.
But it has to be pizza.

00:43:02.282 --> 00:43:04.017
Uh, pizza, right.

00:43:04.151 --> 00:43:05.953
Uh, look, Dad,
we appreciate it,

00:43:06.086 --> 00:43:07.521
but we still got
more errands to run.

00:43:07.654 --> 00:43:10.190
What's going on?
What are you doing up there?

00:43:10.324 --> 00:43:12.693
Don't lie. Tell me.
Are you in trouble?

00:43:12.827 --> 00:43:14.194
Is something wrong?

00:43:14.328 --> 00:43:15.996
Is someone trying to milk you?

00:43:16.130 --> 00:43:17.431
No, ew.
It's never milking!

00:43:17.564 --> 00:43:19.666
Why do you always jump
straight to milking?

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:22.336
Do you need help?
Anything you need, I'm here.

00:43:22.469 --> 00:43:25.005
No!
No. No, no, no.
Dad, look.

00:43:25.139 --> 00:43:26.607
We're just running errands--

00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:29.443
shopping, getting the stuff
we need to live down here.

00:43:29.576 --> 00:43:31.545
Really? That's it?

00:43:31.678 --> 00:43:35.015
Yeah,
that is literally it.
Mm-hmm. Nothing else.

00:43:35.149 --> 00:43:37.886
All right, well, hey.
Thanks for the surprise party.

00:43:38.018 --> 00:43:39.987
Yup. Appreciate it, Dad.
We will be leaving.

00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:41.455
Goodbye.

00:43:53.667 --> 00:43:55.369
Wow, you're actually
a good driver, Donnie.

00:43:55.502 --> 00:43:57.438
Huh. Countless hours
on  <i>Forza Horizon</i>

00:43:57.571 --> 00:43:59.206
- finally paid off.
<i>- Hey, guys.</i>

00:43:59.339 --> 00:44:01.708
Oh, hello?
April, you-- Uh, you there?
<i>Yeah, I got you.</i>

00:44:01.843 --> 00:44:05.712
Now, just know,
this footage is going to be
the definitive imagery

00:44:05.847 --> 00:44:07.514
of your entire existences,

00:44:07.648 --> 00:44:10.617
so, um, like,
don't make it lame or anything.

00:44:10.751 --> 00:44:12.286
We're not the ones
who puke on camera.

00:44:12.419 --> 00:44:14.121
We'd have to try
really hard to do that.

00:44:14.254 --> 00:44:16.523
Hey, shut up, shut up.
Look, here he comes.

00:44:25.766 --> 00:44:28.068
Look at those cars!
Bro,
he's got cool Tims.

00:44:28.202 --> 00:44:30.872
- He's got some swagger.
- This guy is super fly.

00:44:31.004 --> 00:44:33.507
I mean,
look at those rims, bro!

00:44:36.009 --> 00:44:38.178
All right,
there's two cars
and a motorcycle.

00:44:38.312 --> 00:44:39.546
That's like ten dudes, tops.

00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:41.648
Oh, man.
They're gonna be so scared

00:44:41.782 --> 00:44:45.319
when they see
they're about to roll up on
a bunch of mutants!

00:45:03.637 --> 00:45:06.073
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna win a Daytime Emmy.

What do we do, Leo?

00:45:07.674 --> 00:45:09.643
You're the leader.
You should know.

00:45:09.776 --> 00:45:13.347

You don't even know what Alpha formation is!

00:45:24.993 --> 00:45:27.094
What is that?

00:45:34.768 --> 00:45:38.038
Yo, come on, y'all.
Let's get the goods.

00:45:39.606 --> 00:45:40.808
Yo!

00:45:40.942 --> 00:45:42.209
What?

00:45:42.342 --> 00:45:44.177
What the-- Y'all some
little tortoises, huh?

00:45:44.311 --> 00:45:46.613
Damn! Look at you.

00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:48.282
Y'all adorable, man.

00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:51.019
Bad Bernie got some turtles
on the payroll.

00:45:51.151 --> 00:45:52.686
No. We don't work
for Bernie.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.022
We're here to find you.

00:45:54.154 --> 00:45:55.857
I can't believe
there are other mutants!

00:45:55.990 --> 00:45:57.157
Like us!

00:45:57.291 --> 00:45:59.861
This is wild!
I mean, this is crazy-like.

00:45:59.994 --> 00:46:00.929
Let me guess.

00:46:01.061 --> 00:46:02.529
Fifteen years ago, right,

00:46:02.663 --> 00:46:04.765
some sludge
was dumped in a sewer,

00:46:04.899 --> 00:46:06.000
and y'all came from that.

00:46:06.133 --> 00:46:07.601
We prefer the term "ooze,"
but yeah.

00:46:07.734 --> 00:46:09.503
It's like more--
It's just nicer sounding.

00:46:09.636 --> 00:46:11.338
It rolls off
the tongue better.

00:46:11.471 --> 00:46:13.073
Ooze, ooze...

00:46:13.206 --> 00:46:15.609
It's nice, right?
It's ooze.

00:46:15.742 --> 00:46:17.077
Damn! Ooze.

00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:19.346
I like that.
I like "ooze."

00:46:19.479 --> 00:46:23.216
So, look, that same ooze
made me, okay?

00:46:23.350 --> 00:46:24.919
My dad, Baxter Stockman,

00:46:25.053 --> 00:46:28.155
he's the one
who dumped the ooze
down the drain, baby.

00:46:28.288 --> 00:46:30.223
So technically, we cousins.

00:46:30.357 --> 00:46:32.894
We're related.
We're cousins!
What up, cuz?

00:46:33.027 --> 00:46:35.362
Cuzzo, what's up?
That's awesome!
Cuzzo!

00:46:35.495 --> 00:46:37.031
I've always wanted a cousin.

00:46:37.164 --> 00:46:38.765
Well, look at you now.
You got a bunch.

00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:41.635

Figure out what the hell's
going on with this dude.

00:48:54.668 --> 00:48:57.337
So, um, maybe you
could finish explaining

00:48:57.471 --> 00:48:59.173
like exactly
where you came from

00:48:59.306 --> 00:49:00.875
and what you want and stuff?

00:49:01.008 --> 00:49:03.077
What do I want? Oh, easy.

00:49:03.211 --> 00:49:04.544
Acceptance.

00:49:04.678 --> 00:49:07.148
No way, man!
We want that too.
Yeah, like us.

00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:09.349
Let me go back to the start.

00:49:10.283 --> 00:49:12.920
<i>My earliest memory in the world</i>

00:49:13.054 --> 00:49:17.791
<i>is my dad telling me</i>
<i>that he never was accepted.</i>

00:49:17.925 --> 00:49:21.929
<i>He just wanted a family, man.</i>
<i>That's why he created us.</i>

00:49:22.063 --> 00:49:25.166
<i>But then, that's when</i>
<i>the people he worked for</i>

00:49:25.298 --> 00:49:26.234
<i>sent the ops through.</i>

00:49:26.366 --> 00:49:27.935
<i>They took it from him.</i>

00:49:30.171 --> 00:49:33.440
<i>I rescued my little</i>
<i>baby brother and sister.</i>

00:49:33.573 --> 00:49:35.910
<i>And since I was the oldest,</i>
<i>I had to raise them.</i>

00:49:36.043 --> 00:49:39.579
<i>He did a great job.</i>
<i>We're very well-adjusted.</i>

00:49:40.614 --> 00:49:43.350
<i>Anyway,</i>
<i>we thought, these humans,</i>

00:49:43.483 --> 00:49:44.886
<i>yeah, they murdered our dad,</i>

00:49:45.019 --> 00:49:48.688
<i>but maybe they just</i>
<i>ain't all bad, you know?</i>

00:49:50.323 --> 00:49:51.993
<i>We went out. We hit the town.</i>

00:49:52.126 --> 00:49:53.961
<i>And it didn't go well.</i>

00:49:57.865 --> 00:49:59.566
<i>Especially this one dude.</i>

00:49:59.699 --> 00:50:02.402
<i>He wouldn't stop chasing us.</i>
<i>He wanted to kill us!</i>

00:50:02.536 --> 00:50:04.172
Oh, my God.
That's what happened to us.

00:50:04.304 --> 00:50:06.908
That's why our dad
made us live in the sewer
our whole lives.

00:50:07.041 --> 00:50:09.743
Not me. That sounds
like a punk choice.

00:50:09.877 --> 00:50:12.746
You know what I did?
I beat that fool down!

00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:15.615
I touched that chin,
mollywhopped him.

00:50:15.749 --> 00:50:18.186
Whop, whop to
a inch of his life. Bop!

00:50:18.318 --> 00:50:20.121
And then I knew what to do.

00:50:20.254 --> 00:50:23.456
I decided
to kill all the humans

00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:25.592
and let the mutants
rule the Earth.

00:50:25.725 --> 00:50:27.228
That-- That's a take.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:31.665
I inherited my dad's mind
for science and I thought,

00:50:31.798 --> 00:50:35.802
"What if I built a machine
to enact my plan?"

00:50:35.937 --> 00:50:38.973
I've been stealing
all the parts that I need,

00:50:39.106 --> 00:50:41.275
and now I'm ready.

00:50:41.408 --> 00:50:43.945
I'm gonna use
a little of my blood

00:50:44.078 --> 00:50:47.747
to create
a weaponized version
of the ooze.

00:50:47.882 --> 00:50:51.085
Then we gonna launch it
into the atmosphere

00:50:51.219 --> 00:50:54.621
and watch it vaporize.

00:50:54.754 --> 00:50:55.890
Here's the kicker:

00:50:56.023 --> 00:50:57.390
Every animal on Earth

00:50:57.524 --> 00:50:59.293
will be transformed
into a mutant.

00:50:59.426 --> 00:51:03.763
Every fly, flea, tick,
snake, fish and whale.

00:51:03.898 --> 00:51:04.899
Everything!

00:51:05.032 --> 00:51:08.002
And we become
the dominant species on Earth.

00:51:08.135 --> 00:51:12.106
That's bad.
That's very bad... for me.

00:51:13.473 --> 00:51:16.010
What happens to humans
in this plan of yours?

00:51:16.143 --> 00:51:17.577
Nothing good.

00:51:17.711 --> 00:51:19.814
We wish
there was another way
to feel safe and happy,

00:51:19.947 --> 00:51:22.482
but peoples,
they got to go!

00:51:22.616 --> 00:51:25.385
A bunch of them
gonna be eaten, enslaved,

00:51:25.518 --> 00:51:26.988
turned into fuel of some sort.

00:51:27.121 --> 00:51:29.190
Maybe they'll become
a form of entertainment...

00:51:29.323 --> 00:51:30.490
...you know what I mean?

00:51:30.624 --> 00:51:32.260
You know how they used
to have dog shows

00:51:32.392 --> 00:51:33.793
and they had horse races?

00:51:33.928 --> 00:51:37.932
Maybe we'll have redhead shows,
fat booty boy races.

00:51:38.065 --> 00:51:39.867
Baby tossing.
Something like that.

00:51:40.001 --> 00:51:41.369
I'll think of something stupid.

00:51:41.501 --> 00:51:43.403
Wow, that's--
that's even worse.

00:51:43.536 --> 00:51:44.671
They should be pets.

00:51:44.805 --> 00:51:47.041
Honestly,
I'm open to all ideas.

00:51:47.174 --> 00:51:48.508
You know what I mean?

00:51:48.642 --> 00:51:51.012
Any crazy thing y'all think of,
I want to do it.

00:51:51.145 --> 00:51:52.346
You know what I mean?

00:51:52.479 --> 00:51:54.148
Just pitch it
as soon as possible,

00:51:54.282 --> 00:51:57.351
'cause now that I got this,
I can complete my device,

00:51:57.484 --> 00:52:02.089
and acceptance will be ours.

00:52:02.223 --> 00:52:03.991
Yeah!
Yes! Great!

00:52:04.125 --> 00:52:06.994
So wassup?
You wanna roll with us?

00:52:07.128 --> 00:52:10.965

the machine tonight.

00:52:11.098 --> 00:52:12.465

00:52:12.599 --> 00:52:15.036

I don't know,
I'm just getting silly here,

00:52:32.786 --> 00:52:34.055

00:52:36.756 --> 00:52:39.360
Just hypothetically
speaking, obviously.

00:52:39.492 --> 00:52:40.828
Well, that would mean

00:52:41.594 --> 00:52:43.763

we don't--

00:52:53.941 --> 00:52:55.508

00:53:00.181 --> 00:53:02.149
No, don't "cuz" me
right now, man.
We were kidding.

00:53:02.283 --> 00:53:04.551
Drop that.
This ain't got nothing to do with that.

00:53:04.684 --> 00:53:07.855
We're just joking around,
because we are, in fact,
very into your plan.

00:53:07.989 --> 00:53:10.790
It's, like, great!
I love the killing-people part.

00:53:10.925 --> 00:53:12.259
Yeah, I'll cut around that.

00:53:12.393 --> 00:53:13.626
Guys, I got an idea.

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.762
So, uh, S-Fly, my man,

00:53:15.896 --> 00:53:18.232
we'll drive the van
with the storage unit,

00:53:18.366 --> 00:53:19.599
and, uh, you lead the way.

00:53:19.733 --> 00:53:21.135
Nice. Smooth.

00:53:21.268 --> 00:53:23.603
Cool. But I drive fast,

00:53:23.737 --> 00:53:25.306
and I don't want y'all
to get lost,

00:53:25.439 --> 00:53:27.607
so Mondo, Wingnut, Rock!

00:53:28.608 --> 00:53:30.044
Ride with the tortoises.

00:53:30.177 --> 00:53:31.278
I drive!

00:53:31.412 --> 00:53:34.248
You're--
You're good to drive?

00:53:34.382 --> 00:53:35.316
No.

00:53:47.694 --> 00:53:50.031
- Spice Girls! Put 'em on!
- You don't like Phish?

00:53:50.164 --> 00:53:52.066
What's Phish? Spice Girls!

00:53:52.199 --> 00:53:55.503
Why are you looking at me?
You think of something.

00:53:55.635 --> 00:53:58.638
Hey, dudes,
fun cruising with you,

00:53:58.772 --> 00:54:00.508
but where are we going
exactly?

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:03.643
Oh. See that building
over there? That's not it.

00:54:03.777 --> 00:54:07.415
No, we're going to this
super cool shipping graveyard
over on Staten Island.

00:54:07.547 --> 00:54:08.715
It's the best borough, bro.

00:54:08.849 --> 00:54:11.185
I love Staten Island!

00:54:11.318 --> 00:54:13.787
Okay, it's go time.
Attack these fools.

00:54:13.921 --> 00:54:15.923
Not sure that's
as easy as it sounds.

00:54:16.057 --> 00:54:17.925
This dude is literally
a rhinoceros, man.

00:54:18.059 --> 00:54:19.927
How about something
we can all sing along to?

00:54:20.061 --> 00:54:22.796
If we jam the brakes,
they'll fly out of the car.

00:54:22.930 --> 00:54:24.697
There's no windshield.
It's impossible.

00:54:24.832 --> 00:54:27.835
We'd need a long and narrow
device small enough
to get under the seat

00:54:27.968 --> 00:54:29.403
but strong enough
to press the pedal.

00:54:29.537 --> 00:54:30.938
You mean a stick?

00:54:31.072 --> 00:54:32.739
I got it. 4 Non B's.

00:54:41.348 --> 00:54:43.250
How good is this?

00:54:43.384 --> 00:54:44.651
Time of my life.

00:54:44.784 --> 00:54:46.120
God, they're good.

00:54:56.796 --> 00:55:00.167
What's going on?

00:55:00.301 --> 00:55:03.070
Sorry.

00:55:07.374 --> 00:55:08.843
What the--

00:55:10.411 --> 00:55:12.313
Y'all better hurry.

00:55:12.446 --> 00:55:14.281
You hurt Rock, I hurt you.

00:55:32.799 --> 00:55:34.969
Don't worry, guys.
I got this.

00:55:36.437 --> 00:55:39.907
I don't got this.
I don't got this!

00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:41.942
You're dead, tortoises!

00:55:47.414 --> 00:55:49.049
Oh, yeah!

00:55:51.085 --> 00:55:53.420
You can't stop me!
It's a monster truck, dummies!

00:55:53.554 --> 00:55:54.522
Get them, Mondo!

00:55:54.654 --> 00:55:55.856
Donnie!

00:55:55.990 --> 00:55:57.391
Watch where you're driving!

00:55:57.525 --> 00:56:00.793
Yo, dudes, you launched me
out of the front of that van.

00:56:00.928 --> 00:56:02.029
That is not cool!

00:56:02.163 --> 00:56:03.796
I'm so sorry. We had to.

00:56:03.931 --> 00:56:06.367
You know what?
I don't accept that apology!

00:56:06.500 --> 00:56:07.800
Yeah, I'm not sorry at all,

00:56:07.935 --> 00:56:09.637
I'm not gonna lie.

00:56:09.769 --> 00:56:10.703
Boom!

00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:19.746
I'm back, you green punks.

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:21.582
Stop it,
you bloody hooligans

00:56:21.714 --> 00:56:23.284
or I'll bite
your bloody heads off!

00:56:33.494 --> 00:56:34.794
Superfly's almost here,

00:56:34.929 --> 00:56:37.398
and he's not going to be
as nice about this.

00:56:37.531 --> 00:56:38.599
You're not being nice!

00:56:38.731 --> 00:56:40.234
He'll be less nice.

00:56:44.138 --> 00:56:45.206
Oh!

00:56:47.641 --> 00:56:50.244
It's now or never, dudes.
Give us the device.

00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:55.816
♪  <i>6 'N the mornin'</i>
<i>Police at my door</i>  ♪

00:56:55.950 --> 00:56:57.851
Come on!

00:57:03.524 --> 00:57:04.825
My chucks!
Guys?

00:57:07.261 --> 00:57:09.729
No! He used my stick
against me!

00:57:09.863 --> 00:57:11.432
Now he's mollywhopping me!

00:57:15.269 --> 00:57:16.937
Man, I almost thought
y'all was cool.

00:57:17.071 --> 00:57:18.806
See you in hell, turtles!

00:57:18.939 --> 00:57:20.174
Quick, grab it!

00:57:24.078 --> 00:57:25.512
I'm getting ripped in two!

00:57:26.614 --> 00:57:28.949
Goochie goochie goo.

00:57:40.194 --> 00:57:40.861
Oh, no!

00:57:59.813 --> 00:58:00.814
Go, go, go!

00:58:00.948 --> 00:58:03.183
Surround them!
Make a perimeter.

00:58:08.522 --> 00:58:10.991
April! Help!

00:58:13.594 --> 00:58:15.963
Say good night, freak.

00:58:23.070 --> 00:58:25.472
What? What's happening?

00:58:27.541 --> 00:58:29.576
Hey, let us out! Come on!

00:58:29.710 --> 00:58:31.945
Why, hello, turtles.

00:58:32.079 --> 00:58:34.381
I've been looking for you

00:58:34.515 --> 00:58:37.551
for a long, long time.

00:58:37.685 --> 00:58:39.620
Look, lady, I don't know
what you want from us

00:58:39.753 --> 00:58:42.823
or why you talk so scary,
but we shouldn't be in here.

00:58:42.956 --> 00:58:44.625
There's a fly monster!

00:58:45.826 --> 00:58:47.861
I will do the talking.

00:58:48.629 --> 00:58:51.598
I am Cynthia Utrom,

00:58:51.732 --> 00:58:54.501
and you are my property.

00:58:54.635 --> 00:58:56.170
What?

00:58:56.303 --> 00:58:57.371
Hey!

00:58:57.504 --> 00:58:58.572
Stop!

00:58:58.706 --> 00:59:00.274
Enough.

00:59:00.407 --> 00:59:04.745
I will use you
to create a stable mutagen.

00:59:04.878 --> 00:59:07.181
And with that, I will create

00:59:07.314 --> 00:59:10.417
an army of super soldiers.

00:59:10.551 --> 00:59:13.754
Dolphin men to plant bombs
on submarines.

00:59:13.887 --> 00:59:17.191
Eagle men to fight enemy jets.

00:59:17.324 --> 00:59:21.862
Snake men to slither
behind enemy lines.

00:59:21.995 --> 00:59:24.031
The glory of it all

00:59:24.164 --> 00:59:27.234
nearly brings me to tears.

00:59:27.368 --> 00:59:29.870
What does this
have to do with us?
What do you want from us?

00:59:30.003 --> 00:59:33.874
What I want is your blood.

00:59:34.007 --> 00:59:36.777
And there's only one way
to get it.

00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:38.078
Oh, no!

00:59:38.212 --> 00:59:39.980
I can't believe it.
She's gonna...

00:59:40.114 --> 00:59:42.483
Hook them up
to the milking machine!

00:59:43.784 --> 00:59:45.586
She's gonna milk us!

01:00:04.505 --> 01:00:06.841
Ray Fillet,
man, shut your mouth!

01:00:06.974 --> 01:00:10.544
If I want to be sad,
I'll go listen to
some damn John Legend.

01:00:10.677 --> 01:00:11.945
Sorry, sir.
Sorry, bro.

01:00:12.079 --> 01:00:14.581
Remember,
this is a happy day,

01:00:14.715 --> 01:00:20.053
because we're gonna
kill every human on
this big, ol' ugly Earth!

01:00:20.187 --> 01:00:22.156
So smile, Mondo!

01:00:41.975 --> 01:00:44.278
Boys! You come home?
You forgive me?

01:00:44.411 --> 01:00:45.712
My surprise party worked?

01:00:47.882 --> 01:00:49.650
Get back! I'll bite you!

01:00:49.783 --> 01:00:54.421
Hey, Mr. Rat Man. I'm April.

01:00:54.555 --> 01:00:55.956
I come in peace.

01:00:56.089 --> 01:00:57.892
I'm friends with your sons.

01:00:58.058 --> 01:01:00.494
And right now,
they're in trouble.

01:01:11.538 --> 01:01:12.539
No, no, no!

01:01:12.673 --> 01:01:13.974
Stop it!

01:01:17.544 --> 01:01:19.279
That looks bad.
Does it hurt?

01:01:19.413 --> 01:01:21.415
Of course it hurts!
She's milking me!

01:01:21.548 --> 01:01:24.384
Try to think of something
pleasant to take your mind
off the pain.

01:01:24.518 --> 01:01:26.520
Yeah,
think of pizza, Mikey!

01:01:26.653 --> 01:01:29.723
No, pizza's made of cheese,
and cheese is made of milk,

01:01:29.858 --> 01:01:31.024
and I'm being milked!

01:01:31.158 --> 01:01:33.060
It's infiltrated
my every thought!

01:01:34.963 --> 01:01:37.431
I'm so sorry, Mikey.

01:01:37.998 --> 01:01:39.032
Continue milking them

01:01:39.166 --> 01:01:41.068
until we have
the required amount.

01:01:50.945 --> 01:01:54.214
This is it, guys.
We're gonna die getting milked
to death in a lab.

01:01:54.348 --> 01:01:56.918
I can't believe April
just left us.

01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:58.485
Maybe she was just using us.

01:01:58.619 --> 01:02:01.455
Well, she ended up
getting a great story:

01:02:01.588 --> 01:02:04.324
"Turtle Boys Give Supervillain
Last Part of His Evil Machine."

01:02:04.458 --> 01:02:06.026
That's actually
a pretty good title.

01:02:06.159 --> 01:02:07.962
Yeah, very clickbait-y.
I'd definitely
give that a read.

01:02:08.095 --> 01:02:10.464
Oh, I have so many regrets.

01:02:10.597 --> 01:02:13.066
I wish I could've tried
frozen yogurt.

01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.736
You could have!
I know.
And I blew it!

01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:17.504
I wish I could see BTS IRL.

01:02:17.638 --> 01:02:19.339
We could...
I guess we could sing.

01:02:19.473 --> 01:02:21.475
We could do some
of the songs for you.
Yeah, I'm down.

01:02:21.608 --> 01:02:23.510
Really?
That would be great.

01:02:25.212 --> 01:02:26.146
Come on, guys.

01:02:31.385 --> 01:02:33.053
You guys don't even
know the words.

01:02:34.488 --> 01:02:36.089
What is happening?
Got a breach.

01:02:36.223 --> 01:02:37.825
Why did the milking stop?

01:02:37.959 --> 01:02:41.295
Moving Miss Utrom
to a secure location.
Someone's here.

01:02:47.267 --> 01:02:49.069
Huh?
Huh?

01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:53.774
- Boys!
- Dad!

01:02:53.908 --> 01:02:55.642
Stay back, everyone! Stay back!

01:02:55.776 --> 01:02:58.478
I just here for my boys,
who lied to me.

01:02:58.612 --> 01:03:00.647
They are in
so much trouble right now.

01:03:00.781 --> 01:03:02.316
Is that so, Ratatouille?

01:03:02.449 --> 01:03:05.053
Grab another machine
and hook him up like the others.

01:03:05.185 --> 01:03:07.421
Don't call me Ratatouille.

01:03:24.671 --> 01:03:25.772
Go, go, go!

01:03:27.774 --> 01:03:29.209
Kick his butt, Dad!

01:03:29.343 --> 01:03:30.945
Where you gonna
run to, rat?

01:03:42.656 --> 01:03:44.625
Take him down!

01:03:49.696 --> 01:03:50.865
Tase him!

01:04:04.411 --> 01:04:06.179
He's too fast!

01:04:19.693 --> 01:04:20.862
Bravo!
Dad!

01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.782
<i>I'm a ninja!</i>

01:04:45.252 --> 01:04:46.319
Dad!

01:04:46.453 --> 01:04:48.455
- Boys, are you okay?
- Yes!

01:04:48.588 --> 01:04:50.524
We're more than okay.
Yeah, we're good.

01:04:50.657 --> 01:04:52.160
How did you find us?

01:04:53.727 --> 01:04:55.696
I'd be a pretty big
piece of crap

01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:58.432
if I didn't at least try to get
your dad to come help you.

01:04:58.565 --> 01:05:00.434
April!
Oh, my God, you came back?

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:02.502
I did not see that coming.

01:05:02.636 --> 01:05:05.439
This human told me
you lied to me.

01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:07.741
What happened?
What have you been doing?

01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:09.776
Aw, nothing.

01:05:09.911 --> 01:05:12.080
Wait a minute.
What is this machine?

01:05:12.212 --> 01:05:14.148
Nothing. It's nothing.
This machine?

01:05:14.281 --> 01:05:16.316
Does that say
"milking machine"?

01:05:16.450 --> 01:05:17.885
No, no, no.

01:05:18.019 --> 01:05:19.586
It's the opposite of that.

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.122
It's a milking machine.

01:05:21.254 --> 01:05:22.522
See? I told you! They milk you!

01:05:22.656 --> 01:05:24.257
Now I actually might puke.

01:05:24.391 --> 01:05:27.161
Boys, you left the sewer
and got milked.

01:05:27.294 --> 01:05:30.198
You helped some evil fly man
create a machine

01:05:30.330 --> 01:05:32.133
that is gonna destroy
the world

01:05:32.265 --> 01:05:34.801
and kill
the only good human, April!

01:05:34.936 --> 01:05:37.337
So, we're going
to clean up your mess,

01:05:37.471 --> 01:05:40.875
then go home
and stay there forever, okay?

01:05:41.008 --> 01:05:42.409
What about April's story?

01:05:42.542 --> 01:05:44.078
Forget the story!

01:05:44.212 --> 01:05:46.546
April, go home.
It's over, okay?

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:52.385
There's only one way
for you to be safe and happy,

01:05:52.519 --> 01:05:54.155
and that's listen to me.

01:05:54.287 --> 01:05:55.589
Let's go.

01:06:00.027 --> 01:06:02.362
Sorry we couldn't help you
get prom uncanceled.

01:06:02.496 --> 01:06:04.232
Nah, it's all right.

01:06:04.364 --> 01:06:06.433
Seeing you guys
make so many mistakes

01:06:06.566 --> 01:06:08.535
just to get people to like you
made me realize

01:06:08.668 --> 01:06:12.672
I was definitely doing this
for the wrong reason.

01:06:23.184 --> 01:06:24.886
Oh, perfect.

01:06:26.854 --> 01:06:29.623
Backup arriving now.
Sealing off the entrance.

01:06:42.904 --> 01:06:45.273
Maybe they decided
to just give up

01:06:45.405 --> 01:06:46.874

01:06:47.008 --> 01:06:48.810
Nah, fam, nah.

01:06:48.943 --> 01:06:50.845
We just one step ahead
of y'all.

01:06:51.645 --> 01:06:53.114
Scram!
Betrayers!

01:06:53.247 --> 01:06:55.782
You're the ones
that instigated this!

01:06:56.516 --> 01:06:57.819
What's up, bros?

01:06:57.952 --> 01:06:59.519

- Back up!

these stinking humans

01:07:06.994 --> 01:07:08.461
that you love so much?

01:07:08.595 --> 01:07:11.032
Humans are
complicated creatures.

01:07:11.165 --> 01:07:12.834
They're good, like April,

01:07:12.967 --> 01:07:15.036

who milked us.

01:07:15.169 --> 01:07:16.237

01:07:16.369 --> 01:07:18.371
As much
as I don't like them--

01:07:18.505 --> 01:07:20.607
and trust me,
I do not like them--

01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:23.710
if we kill them, we are
no better than they are.

01:07:23.845 --> 01:07:25.813
I refuse to accept
that you all are cool

You're not killers.
I mean, come on, look at you.

01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:38.192
But it's the only way
we'll be accepted.

01:07:38.326 --> 01:07:40.560
No!
We accept you.

01:07:40.694 --> 01:07:42.429
You could come live with us.
We accept you.

01:07:42.562 --> 01:07:44.065
Yes, plenty of room.

01:07:44.198 --> 01:07:46.399

to murder everyone on Earth.

01:07:46.533 --> 01:07:48.035

No. We don't want to do this.

Even though
I don't like humans,

01:14:04.678 --> 01:14:06.614
I want them to like you,

01:14:06.746 --> 01:14:09.116

01:14:09.250 --> 01:14:11.151

01:14:11.285 --> 01:14:12.686

We are gonna show it

01:14:15.823 --> 01:14:18.292
And the world will love you
and accept you!

01:14:18.425 --> 01:14:22.363
And the world will chant,
"Turtles, Turtles, Turtles!"

01:14:22.496 --> 01:14:23.697

I'm fully roused.

01:14:28.302 --> 01:14:30.237
But a little bit
of a buzzkill here:

01:14:30.371 --> 01:14:32.506

<i>Yeah, obviously.</i>

It's a lot
to catch up on, okay?

01:14:45.019 --> 01:14:46.854
But first,
do you maybe know any ways

01:14:46.987 --> 01:14:48.589
we might be able
to stop that thing?

01:14:50.057 --> 01:14:53.827
Well, I actually might
have something.

01:14:53.961 --> 01:14:56.664

01:14:56.796 --> 01:14:57.631

We're dangling, baby!

01:15:20.254 --> 01:15:22.656
Yep, this is
not triumphant at all.

01:15:23.957 --> 01:15:25.259

01:16:13.006 --> 01:16:13.941

01:16:15.776 --> 01:16:17.277

no!

Somebody's mad about that.

01:17:29.818 --> 01:17:31.251
I think we lost him.

01:17:39.894 --> 01:17:42.029
Ouch.

01:17:44.298 --> 01:17:47.000
Hit that from the back.

01:17:49.736 --> 01:17:51.238
You good, guys?

01:17:52.439 --> 01:17:54.775
<i>Monstrous mutants</i> <i>are rampaging...
</i> Oh, no.

01:17:54.909 --> 01:17:56.076
<i>...through downtown New York.</i>

01:17:56.210 --> 01:17:57.444
<i>The only question is</i>

01:17:57.578 --> 01:17:59.379
<i>do we capture them</i>
<i>for experimentation</i>

01:17:59.513 --> 01:18:01.248
<i>or kill them on sight?</i>
<i>Taking calls...</i>

01:18:01.381 --> 01:18:02.917
<i>If you're just joining us,</i>

01:18:03.050 --> 01:18:04.384
<i>mutants are attacking the city.</i>

01:18:04.518 --> 01:18:06.653
<i>A rash</i>
<i>of monsters in New York</i>

01:18:06.787 --> 01:18:07.788
<i>is taking over Times Square.</i>

01:18:07.922 --> 01:18:09.156
<i>We don't know what they are,</i>

01:18:09.289 --> 01:18:10.859
<i>but there will be</i>
<i>a military response.</i>

01:18:10.991 --> 01:18:13.727
<i>...threatening to take</i>
<i>a bite out of the Big Apple.</i>

01:18:13.862 --> 01:18:17.130
<i>Reports indicate widespread</i>
<i>destruction and chaos.</i>

01:18:17.264 --> 01:18:19.433
<i>One thing I know:</i>
<i>I hate mutants!</i>

01:18:19.566 --> 01:18:21.034
<i>Sightings of the turtles</i>

01:18:21.168 --> 01:18:22.703
<i>and the mess</i>
<i>they leave in their path</i>

01:18:22.837 --> 01:18:24.004
<i>have been greatly disturbing.</i>

01:18:24.137 --> 01:18:25.706
It's them!

01:18:28.475 --> 01:18:31.512
I don't think
this is gonna go down
how we wanted it to.

01:18:31.645 --> 01:18:33.580
They... hate us.

01:18:33.714 --> 01:18:37.317
They think we're villains.
No. Worse.

01:18:38.452 --> 01:18:40.187
They think we're monsters.

01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.723
We're never gonna be normal.

01:18:42.857 --> 01:18:44.258
Look, guys,

01:18:44.725 --> 01:18:45.960
April was right.

01:18:46.093 --> 01:18:48.195
We were doing this
for the wrong reasons.

01:18:48.328 --> 01:18:49.998
I know we only wanted
to be heroes

01:18:50.130 --> 01:18:51.665
to be accepted.

01:18:51.798 --> 01:18:54.936
But even though it looks like
we'll never be accepted,

01:18:55.068 --> 01:18:57.070
I still think
we should try to be heroes.

01:18:57.204 --> 01:18:58.272
But how?

01:18:58.405 --> 01:18:59.773
Every plan we've had
has failed.

01:18:59.908 --> 01:19:02.576
Plan? You're complaining
we don't have a plan?

01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:05.947
Mikey, what do you do
better than anyone,
even Mark Ruffalo?

01:19:06.079 --> 01:19:07.314
Improvise.

01:19:07.447 --> 01:19:08.615
It's impossible.

01:19:08.749 --> 01:19:10.584
Says the guy
who has read more comics

01:19:10.717 --> 01:19:13.320
where people are
fighting giant monsters
than anyone on Earth!

01:19:13.453 --> 01:19:15.722
I have, but--
You must be able
to think of a way

01:19:15.857 --> 01:19:17.324
to stop something like that.

01:19:19.961 --> 01:19:22.195
Of course!  <i>Attack on Titan!</i>

01:19:22.329 --> 01:19:25.299
Giant monsters attack,
and they have one weakness--

01:19:25.432 --> 01:19:26.667
on the backs of their necks.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:30.370
Yes, and the blowhole
is exactly that.

01:19:31.138 --> 01:19:32.539
That's it.

01:19:32.673 --> 01:19:34.809
If we can get this thing
into that thing's blowhole,

01:19:34.943 --> 01:19:36.376
it'll go into its bloodstream.

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:37.711
I bet it'll demutanize it.

01:19:37.845 --> 01:19:40.514
There you go!
Demutanize the big monster!

01:19:40.647 --> 01:19:42.082
And, Raph,

01:19:42.215 --> 01:19:43.650
it's time to go loud.
Loud?

01:19:43.784 --> 01:19:45.954
Real loud.
As loud as you've ever gone.

01:19:46.086 --> 01:19:47.788
Use that rage of yours
to help us.

01:19:47.922 --> 01:19:49.323
Okay, I will!

01:19:52.459 --> 01:19:55.529
We got to get you
into therapy.

01:19:58.265 --> 01:19:59.934
You know, just then,

01:20:00.068 --> 01:20:01.735

in your life,

01:20:01.869 --> 01:20:03.136
you didn't sound lame.

01:20:03.270 --> 01:20:05.073
You actually sounded
like a leader.
I do?

01:20:05.205 --> 01:20:06.941
Oh, I do! I sound
like such a leader!

01:20:07.075 --> 01:20:09.209
Holy crap,
that's so dope!
And you ruined it.

01:20:09.343 --> 01:20:11.178
Let's do this!

01:20:18.285 --> 01:20:20.822
Dear Lord, this helmet
was a good investment.

01:20:25.192 --> 01:20:27.095
Not on my watch.

01:20:28.395 --> 01:20:30.697
Okay, not great.
Not great at all.

01:20:30.832 --> 01:20:31.798
Very bad.

01:20:31.933 --> 01:20:33.034
If you're just joining us,

01:20:33.166 --> 01:20:34.301
an army of mutants

01:20:34.434 --> 01:20:36.670
that appears to be led
by four turtle men

01:20:36.803 --> 01:20:39.807
is attacking the city
with a giant whale monster.

01:20:41.208 --> 01:20:43.777
Keep rolling!
I got the real story!

01:20:43.911 --> 01:20:46.413
April O'Neil here, and--

and confirmed information.

01:20:59.426 --> 01:21:01.194
A fly monster is
attacking the city,

01:21:01.328 --> 01:21:02.596
but the turtle teens,

01:21:02.729 --> 01:21:05.133
along with the rat, warthog,
stingray, crocodile,

01:21:05.265 --> 01:21:07.135
bat, frog, lizard
and cockroach lady

01:21:07.267 --> 01:21:09.904
are in fact fighting
against the monster

01:21:10.038 --> 01:21:11.973
in an attempt to save New York.

01:21:12.106 --> 01:21:13.340
The giant monster is bad,

01:21:13.473 --> 01:21:15.676
but the mutants you see here
are in fact good!

01:21:18.278 --> 01:21:20.414
Sorry. I really thought
I got past that.

01:21:20.547 --> 01:21:21.949
That's a thing from my past.

01:21:22.083 --> 01:21:23.784
Anyway, as I was saying...

01:21:26.120 --> 01:21:28.856
Whoa!

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:46.974
Whoa, Dad, you speak
the same language as Scumbug?

01:21:47.108 --> 01:21:49.242
We actually have
a lot in common.

01:21:49.376 --> 01:21:51.045
I'm really attracted to her.

01:21:51.179 --> 01:21:52.279
Oh, that's gross.

01:21:52.412 --> 01:21:53.915
Donnie, you should
not be driving.

01:21:54.048 --> 01:21:57.617
Sorry, Dad.
But since you are,
go there!

01:22:09.997 --> 01:22:12.299

01:22:12.432 --> 01:22:14.501

01:22:49.003 --> 01:22:51.772
That's it!
You are done. It's over.

01:22:51.906 --> 01:22:53.673

gonna stop me.

01:22:53.808 --> 01:22:59.147

are never gonna like you

This sucks!
I know I said your faces
were the last things

01:23:07.255 --> 01:23:09.257

we're actually about to die,

Yes. Yeah.

No, no.

I'm proud of you boys.

01:28:38.452 --> 01:28:39.420
I love you.

01:28:39.553 --> 01:28:40.454
We love you.

01:28:40.588 --> 01:28:41.856
Love you too.

01:28:41.989 --> 01:28:43.858
And I love you too,
sweetie.

01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:46.060
Dad, really!
That's gross!

01:28:47.428 --> 01:28:50.730
Now go show them humans
how cool you are.

01:29:22.963 --> 01:29:25.732
Do I what? No, no.
That's tortoises.

01:29:26.367 --> 01:29:27.468
Guys!
Hey, April!

01:29:27.601 --> 01:29:29.170
Hey.
I'm so happy you made it.

01:29:29.303 --> 01:29:32.039
Let me show you around.
Oh, okay.

01:29:32.173 --> 01:29:33.240
Yo, wait up.

01:31:56.784 --> 01:31:58.018
Hey, hello!

01:31:58.152 --> 01:32:01.822
It's Donnie,
and I have found my people.

01:32:06.093 --> 01:32:07.695
Fold him in half!

01:32:07.828 --> 01:32:08.929
G'day, mate.

01:32:09.063 --> 01:32:10.998
Welcome to
my Australian shoe store.

01:32:11.131 --> 01:32:13.067
Uh, do you have any Nikes?

01:32:13.200 --> 01:32:16.503
No, but I do have
the Australian version.

01:32:16.637 --> 01:32:17.571
Crikeys!

01:32:17.705 --> 01:32:19.006
April O'Neil here,

01:32:19.139 --> 01:32:21.742
working on the next big story
for "April Tonight."

01:32:21.875 --> 01:32:24.044
Leo, how many times--
Landscape!

01:32:24.178 --> 01:32:26.180
Oh, yep, sorry. My bad.

01:32:26.313 --> 01:32:27.514
Who is TCRI,

01:32:27.648 --> 01:32:30.217
the shady
black-ops organization
behind the mutants?

01:32:30.351 --> 01:32:33.587
Their offices abandoned
after the mutant attack!

01:32:33.721 --> 01:32:35.122
Gone without a trace.

01:32:35.255 --> 01:32:37.558
But we will find them.

01:32:37.691 --> 01:32:40.494
Yeah, that's real.
Yeah, we will.

01:32:41.929 --> 01:32:45.265
Uh, hey, April,
now that prom is back on,

01:32:45.399 --> 01:32:49.570
do you-- I mean, do you
maybe want to, well...

01:32:49.703 --> 01:32:50.971
I'd love to, Leo.

01:32:51.105 --> 01:32:52.906
You looked like
you were gonna puke there.

01:32:54.108 --> 01:32:55.676
I almost did.

01:32:55.810 --> 01:32:57.846
So the way I do it is,
I go...

01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:03.517
This is as friends,
right?
What?

01:33:16.497 --> 01:33:17.664
Well...

01:33:17.798 --> 01:33:20.300
...it appears as though
finding these creatures

01:33:20.434 --> 01:33:22.770
will be easier than I thought.

01:33:22.903 --> 01:33:25.606
Capturing them,
on the other hand,

01:33:25.739 --> 01:33:27.708
might prove difficult.

01:33:27.842 --> 01:33:29.743
There is one option.

01:33:29.878 --> 01:33:31.912
Yes. I know.

01:33:32.045 --> 01:33:34.515
Bring me...

01:33:36.583 --> 01:33:38.218
the Shredder.
