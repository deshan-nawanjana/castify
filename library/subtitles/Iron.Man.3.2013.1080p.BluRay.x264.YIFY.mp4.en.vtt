You know, look...
I got a real job. What do you want?

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.600
I'm working.
I've got something going on, here.

00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.807
What, harassing interns?

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.166
<i>Let me tell you something.
Do you know what happened</i>

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.241
<i>when I told people
I was Iron Man's bodyguard?</i>

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:02.288
<i>- They would laugh in my face.</i>
(TONY CHUCKLES)

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.761
<i>I had to leave
while I still had a shred of dignity.</i>

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.684
<i>Now I got a real job.
I'm watching Pepper.</i>

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.569
What's going on? Fill me in.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.846
<i>- For real?</i>
- Yeah.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.525
<i>All right.
So, she's meeting up with this scientist.</i>

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.250
<i>- Rich guy. Handsome.</i>
- Right.

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.727
<i>I couldn't make his face, at first. Right?
You know I'm good with faces.</i>

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.801
- Oh, yeah, you're the best.
<i>- Yeah.</i>

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.245
<i>Well, so I run his credentials.
I make him.</i>

00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.841
<i>Aldrich Killian.
We actually met the guy back in...</i>

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.201
<i>Where were we in '99?</i>

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:23.566
<i>- The science conference?</i>
- Um...

00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.209
- Switzerland.
- Right, right, exactly.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.765
Killian. No...
I don't remember that guy.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.365
Of course you don't remember.
He's not a blond with a big rack.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.090
<i>At first, it was fine.
They were tanking business.</i>

00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:34.323
But now it's, like, getting weird.
He's showing her his big brain.

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:36.164
- His what?
<i>- Big brain.</i>

00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.801
<i>And she likes it.
Here, let me show you.</i>

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.890
Hold on. See?

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.761
<i>Look at what? You, watching them?</i>

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.564
<i>Flip the screen,
and then we can get started.</i>

00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.491
I'm not a tech genius like you.
Just trust me. Get down here.

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.290
Flip the screen.
Then I can see what they're doing.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:49.606
I can't!
I don't know how to flip the screen!

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.446
<i>Don't talk to me like that any more.
You're not my boss.</i>

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.120
<i>All right?
I don't work for you.</i>

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.649
<i>And I don't trust this guy.
He's got another guy with him.</i>

00:16:56.720 --> 00:16:57.767
<i>He's shifty.</i>

00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:58.841
- Relax.
<i>- Seriously?</i>

00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.445
I'm just asking you
to secure the perimeter.

00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:01.846
Tell them to go out
for a drink or something.

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.605
You know what? You should take more
of an interest in what's going on here.

00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.450
This woman's the best thing
that ever happened to you

00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.965
and you're just ignoring her.

00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:08.121
- A giant brain?
- Yeah.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.531
There's a giant brain.
There's a shifty character.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:12.281
I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna
run his plates and I'm gonna...

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.880
You know,
if it gets rough, so be it.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.607
I miss you, Happy.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.802
Yeah, I miss you, too.
But the way it used to be.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.121
<i>Now you're off with the super-friends.</i>

00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:20.406
<i>I don't know
what's going on with you any more.</i>

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:21.561
<i>- The world's getting weird.</i>
- Hey!

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.641
(STAMMERING)
I hate to cut you off.

00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.721
- Do you have your Taser on you?
<i>- Why?</i>

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.007
I think there's a gal in H.R.
who's trying to steal some printer ink.

00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.162
You should probably go over there
and zap her.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.566
<i>Yeah, nice.</i>

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:34.489
Imagine if you could hack into
the hard drive of any living organism

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.608
and recode its DNA.

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:38.689
- That would be incredible.
- Hmm.

00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.481
Unfortunately, to my ears,
it also sounds highly weaponisable.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.247
As in, enhanced soldiers,
private armies, and Tony is...

00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:48.004
Tony, Tony.

00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.807
You know, I invited Tony to join AIM
13 years ago.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:54.927
He turned me down.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.447
But something tells me
now there's a new genius on the throne

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.808
who doesn't have to
answer to Tony any more

00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.848
and who has slightly less of an ego.

00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:08.931
It's gonna be a no, Aldrich.

00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.404
As much as I'd like to help you.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:17.002
Well, I can't say that
I'm not disappointed.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.805
But then,
as my father used to say,

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:21.645
"Failure is the fog
through which we glimpse triumph."

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:23.205
- That's very deep.
- Hmm.

00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:24.691
And I have no idea
what it means.

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:27.042
No, me neither.
He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

You're wearing this in the house now?

00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:30.650
What is that, like, Mark 15?

TONY: Uh, yeah.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.529
Something like that.
You know, everybody needs a hobby.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:36.807
Oh, and you have to wear your hobby
in the living room?

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.609

Well, hey, did you see
your Christmas present?

00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.486
Yes, I did. I...

00:19:45.560 --> 00:19:48.086
I don't know how I could've
missed that Christmas present.

00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:50.208
Is it gonna fit through the door?

it's a good question.

They're gonna blow out that wall.

Ooh, shoulders, a little knotty.
Naughty girl.

I don't want to harp on this,
but did you like the custom rabbit?

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.161
Did I like it?

00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.011

- Wow.

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.890
I appreciate the thought very much.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.562

- The facial slit?
- Uh-huh.

Well, why don't I
run down to the garage

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:28.086
and see if I can't find a crowbar
to jimmy that thing open?

00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:29.810

I seem to do quite well for a stretch,</i>

01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:40.883

I say the wrong cranberry.</i>

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.246

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.482

Where is it?

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:53.446

01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:06.248
Um, it does say Miami, Florida.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:09.290
Okay, first things first, I need
the armour. Where are we at with it?

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.766
