00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:36.927
You think you've had
Ah a bad day at work?

00:00:36.928 --> 00:00:38.828
I think I got you beaten.

00:00:46.018 --> 00:00:49.529
Nope. That's my partner.

00:00:57.878 --> 00:00:59.930
Suck it!

00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:00.931
There I am.

00:01:00.932 --> 00:01:04.232
Three or four days ago, I
didn't know this world existed.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:11.233
Three or four days ago, I wasn't
in the Rest In Peace Department.

00:02:10.048 --> 00:02:11.348
I heard you coming by the way.

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:15.049
Look at this French girl gets
the job from Boston's finest.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.050
Hey, you got the drop on me huh?

00:02:16.051 --> 00:02:19.051
I feel like a genius right now. I
couldn't have planned this better.

00:02:19.052 --> 00:02:22.425
Well, genius there is an
orange tree in the backyard.

00:02:22.426 --> 00:02:24.426
I like it there.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Yeah, there is an orange tree
in the backyard. How weird.

00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:36.462
I don't know how it get here.
Me neither.

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:38.678
You know it's a similar
prosperity, don't you?

00:02:38.679 --> 00:02:39.679
No. I've never heard that.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.680
It is. Ask anyone for it.

00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:44.681
No. You're crazy. This tree is never
gonna make it through the winter.

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.682
Well, we aren't gonna make
it through the winter.

00:02:47.683 --> 00:02:49.683
In this freezing little house.

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:52.684
I love our freezing
little house.

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:58.770
But don't you want more?

00:02:58.771 --> 00:03:01.831
I always worried about money. Don't
you want to real a house, a car?

00:03:02.971 --> 00:03:04.402
I don't worry about
money, You do.

00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:06.833
I have everything I
need right here.

00:03:08.115 --> 00:03:11.115
My husband with me.

00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:14.221
Well, you will always have that.

00:03:21.573 --> 00:03:24.573
I got to go to work.

00:03:24.574 --> 00:03:27.574
I'll tell you when you can go to work.
Oh, really?

00:03:36.604 --> 00:03:39.604
Watch that ankle.
Love you, baby!

00:03:41.332 --> 00:03:44.332
Bye. Love you!

00:04:00.067 --> 00:04:02.067
I got my picture in the
trophy case I see.

00:04:02.068 --> 00:04:04.068
Look at that! Already
immortalized.

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.069
Oh, right place, right time.
What can I say?

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.070
Hey, Bobby. Hey.

00:04:10.071 --> 00:04:12.387
Garth, Jesus, get a
rope or something.

00:04:12.388 --> 00:04:15.388
You're asking too
much of that towel.

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.389
Morning, partner.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.390
Good morning.

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:22.391
Hey guys, love to have you
at the Union, maybe, Monday.

00:04:22.392 --> 00:04:25.391
Oh sweet Jesus, Murphy. Come on! Oh no!
I will shoot that thing.

00:04:25.392 --> 00:04:29.393
That's pretty devastating. It's gonna
be awhile before I get that image out.

00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:32.394
Hey, what did you do with yours?

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:37.069
I burried it. Really?

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.070
I thought you'll be joking about that.
You know it's not the worst idea.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.071
It's gold and you buried it.
Right?

00:04:42.072 --> 00:04:47.072
Listen, Bobby. I'm out.

00:04:47.073 --> 00:04:50.073
You're out?

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.709
Nothing has to change for you.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.710
You do whatever you want. But I'm putting
mine in the evidence. It's done.

00:04:57.711 --> 00:05:01.711
Nicky. I said I will move it first.
I'll take care of everything.

00:05:02.712 --> 00:05:03.712
It's not what I'm
talking about Bobby.

00:05:03.713 --> 00:05:05.713
I'm talking about the way she
looked at me this morning.

00:05:05.714 --> 00:05:07.714
I knew.

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:10.715
We went in there to make a drug bust.
Which we did.

00:05:10.716 --> 00:05:12.729
We didn't expect this gold
to fall through our laps.

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:13.716
We weren't looking for it.

00:05:13.717 --> 00:05:15.717
But then it happened.

00:05:15.718 --> 00:05:20.718
The way I see it. You do it for Julia.
For your future together. It's simple.

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:24.719
No. She's happy. I'm not
going to risk that.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.720
I'm sorry buddy.

00:05:29.814 --> 00:05:33.814
Oh, you're right.

00:05:33.815 --> 00:05:35.815
I hate it when you're right.

00:05:35.816 --> 00:05:38.816
We got to turn the
whole thing in.

00:05:38.817 --> 00:05:41.817
There goes the speedboat.

00:05:41.818 --> 00:05:45.818
Look, you don't have to worry. I'm
not biting my fingers at you.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:47.819
You do whaever you want to do.

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.820
No. It's bothering me too.

00:05:50.821 --> 00:05:52.219
So, let's grow old
and poor together.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.821
Listen up! We got Garza.
We got an address.

00:05:53.822 --> 00:05:57.098
Wait, you got Garza? You
got an actual eyes on him?

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.323
An informant gave up this
whole meth operation.

00:05:58.324 --> 00:06:00.339
He's there we got him.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.824
Okay, We're in
business, partner.

00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:04.825
Get another picture
in the trophy case.

00:06:11.272 --> 00:06:13.272
Do you know how long we've been
waiting for Garza to slip up?

00:06:13.273 --> 00:06:17.273
The guy is a Meth dealer, a cop killer.
He's got 30 guys with them.

00:06:17.274 --> 00:06:18.274
It's not gonna go easy.

00:06:18.275 --> 00:06:23.275
Now, standby for inspiring motivating
words from Detective Bobby Hayes.

00:06:23.276 --> 00:06:24.276
How about we don't
get shot today.

00:06:24.277 --> 00:06:27.277
That's great advice here.
You're good cop.

00:06:27.278 --> 00:06:29.278
Detective Hayes advice us we
should avoid getting shot.

00:06:29.279 --> 00:06:32.279
And also everybody should put
their charm braclets on now.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.280
Hey, that's my grandmother's St.
Christopher Medal, jackass.

00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:37.281
It's adorable.

00:06:37.282 --> 00:06:39.282
I wear for protection.

00:06:39.283 --> 00:06:41.283
As for protection, well
this stop bullets.

00:06:41.284 --> 00:06:44.284
And yours is stops you
from getting dates.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:05.620
Let's go!

00:07:05.621 --> 00:07:07.621
Move it! Move in! Let's go!

00:07:11.503 --> 00:07:13.503
Move in!

00:07:18.613 --> 00:07:20.613
Stay on my lead. Let's
put them on their heals.

00:07:20.614 --> 00:07:23.614
Hey, Be safe will ya?

00:07:36.738 --> 00:07:38.738
Knock. Knock.

00:07:42.087 --> 00:07:45.087
Police Officer!

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.280
I see Garza.

00:08:33.457 --> 00:08:35.457
He's on the catwalk.

00:08:48.576 --> 00:08:51.576
Damn it! Garza out
the South window.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Jesus! Wow that was close.

00:08:56.001 --> 00:08:59.001
The hell you're doing?
You almost got me.

00:08:59.002 --> 00:09:02.002
Bud, I can't let you
turn that gold in.

00:09:02.003 --> 00:09:05.003
What?

00:11:31.547 --> 00:11:34.547
Tuff day.

00:11:34.548 --> 00:11:37.548
It's a little old to be in
a tounge tied at first.

00:11:37.549 --> 00:11:39.549
I want you to know that
I'm here to help you.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:42.550
I've sat in that chair.

00:11:42.551 --> 00:11:45.551
So take your time.

00:11:45.552 --> 00:11:47.552
Ease in to it.

00:11:47.553 --> 00:11:49.553
Ease in to what?

00:11:50.913 --> 00:11:53.913
Come on genius. I know
you can get there.

00:11:59.267 --> 00:12:01.267
This is a joke.

00:12:01.268 --> 00:12:04.268
Halarious. Hahaha.

00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:06.269
I'm dead?

00:12:06.270 --> 00:12:08.270
Let's be honest.
Being a dirty cop.

00:12:08.271 --> 00:12:11.271
Is one of the highest shot
in the face percentage jobs.

00:12:11.272 --> 00:12:15.272
That's not who I am. Really?
Pretty boy?

00:12:15.273 --> 00:12:18.273
How'd it feel as you were
headed towards judgment?

00:12:18.274 --> 00:12:21.274
Comfortable? Feel like
you're bound for glory?

00:12:21.275 --> 00:12:25.275
Or you're a little worried
that you're going down.

00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:27.276
I thought so.

00:12:27.277 --> 00:12:30.277
You're lucky Nick.

00:12:30.278 --> 00:12:32.278
You have skills that we want.

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:34.279
So, we're giving you a choice.

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.280
You can take your
chances with judgment.

00:12:37.281 --> 00:12:42.281
Or you can join the R.I.P.D.

00:12:43.428 --> 00:12:46.428
The R.I.P.D?

00:12:46.429 --> 00:12:48.429
Rest In Peace Department.

00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:51.430
I get it. It's cute.

00:12:51.431 --> 00:12:58.431
Simply put, we find dead people that
have manage to escape judgment.

00:12:58.432 --> 00:13:03.432
We ship them off back down
to where they belong.

00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:05.433
Tour is 100 years.

00:13:05.434 --> 00:13:07.434
You say yes we send you
back down to Boston.

00:13:07.435 --> 00:13:10.435
Your home turf. I'll do it.

00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:12.436
That's not gonna work.

00:13:12.437 --> 00:13:15.437
What's not going to work?
I said I'm in.

00:13:15.438 --> 00:13:17.438
I know what you're thinking.
You're in a rush.

00:13:17.439 --> 00:13:19.439
You want your life back.
You want Julia.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.440
No. You asked me to help you.

00:13:21.441 --> 00:13:22.441
And I'm here to help.

00:13:22.442 --> 00:13:25.442
You really don't think
I can read you?

00:13:29.033 --> 00:13:32.033
I know everything there
is to know about you.

00:13:32.034 --> 00:13:35.034
Don't ponder on this
opportunity, Nick.

00:13:35.035 --> 00:13:36.035
I know for a fact.

00:13:36.036 --> 00:13:39.036
You can use a good recommendation
on Judgement Day, okay?

00:13:39.037 --> 00:13:43.037
I think you're smelling
what I'm selling.

00:13:44.377 --> 00:13:47.377
Any more questions?

00:13:47.378 --> 00:13:51.378
What's with this Steely Dan?

00:13:51.379 --> 00:13:55.379
No idea. It's always playing.

00:13:55.380 --> 00:13:58.380
Seems to relax people.

00:14:01.510 --> 00:14:04.510
Let's do this. Yes Lax.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:07.511
This will tickle abit.

00:14:12.435 --> 00:14:15.435
What the fuck?

00:14:28.923 --> 00:14:31.923
Why don't you jump in
and get over here?

00:14:52.274 --> 00:14:55.274
Settle down!

00:14:55.275 --> 00:14:58.275
This is holding we
call them Dead'O.

00:14:58.276 --> 00:15:02.276
Until they popped they
look like regular people.

00:15:02.277 --> 00:15:05.277
So, no one except us knows
they're monsters inside.

00:15:05.278 --> 00:15:07.278
Hey!

00:15:07.279 --> 00:15:09.279
You see if you slipped through the cracks,
and stand right there if you die,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.280
Your souls rots.

00:15:11.281 --> 00:15:13.281
They rot. The world rots.

00:15:13.282 --> 00:15:16.282
Global warming, Black plaque,
Bad cell receptions. Get it?

00:15:16.283 --> 00:15:19.283
Without the R.I.P.D, the world would
have been overrun by these dead people.

00:15:19.284 --> 00:15:21.284
Sometime in 1954.

00:15:21.285 --> 00:15:24.285
I'll stay. No option.

00:15:24.286 --> 00:15:26.783
150,000 people die everyday.
This place is,

00:15:26.784 --> 00:15:29.286
wasn't design to handle
that kind of volume.

00:15:29.287 --> 00:15:33.287
Welcome to the big league.

00:15:33.288 --> 00:15:36.288
R.I.P.D. Boston.

00:15:44.265 --> 00:15:48.265
Before you are the greatest law
officers, who ever lived and died.

00:15:48.266 --> 00:15:51.266
With the 3rd biggest
precinct in the force.

00:15:51.267 --> 00:15:54.267
What's the first? Bocca.

00:15:54.268 --> 00:15:57.268
R.I.P.D. Scottsdale a
lot of volume too.

00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:58.769
Trust me, Chase here is
making a big come back.

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:00.269
I'm telling you!

00:16:00.270 --> 00:16:03.270
Chicks dig it.

00:16:03.271 --> 00:16:06.271
It's a lot to take in
on your first day dead.

00:16:06.272 --> 00:16:09.272
But don't worry, your partner
will explain it all to you.

00:16:13.043 --> 00:16:17.043
No! Go get your hands off me!

00:16:17.044 --> 00:16:24.044
I said get your hands off me!

00:16:24.045 --> 00:16:26.045
Almost had him.

00:16:35.012 --> 00:16:38.012
Come on! Roy! Oh you come on!

00:16:38.013 --> 00:16:40.013
'Cause I'm the only one
willing to leave the love.

00:16:40.014 --> 00:16:44.014
Oh Jesus. Oh you Jesus!

00:16:44.015 --> 00:16:49.015
Roy! What? He was
going for the door.

00:16:49.016 --> 00:16:53.016
I wont plant a gun on him, If
it makes you feel any better.

00:16:53.017 --> 00:16:56.017
Would you like to take this
up to the Eternal Affairs?

00:16:56.018 --> 00:17:00.018
We both know what this is
about, don't we, honeypon?

00:17:00.019 --> 00:17:02.019
Not the time, Roy.

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:05.020
Why not have it out now?
I'm comfortable.

00:17:06.783 --> 00:17:09.783
Roy, meet your new partner.

00:17:09.784 --> 00:17:11.784
Nick Walker.

00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:16.669
We've been over this before.
I'm a one man operation.

00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:19.670
Had a choice Roy?

00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:34.049
Nope. You got to earn that.

00:17:34.050 --> 00:17:41.050
Come on, Rookie. Grab your.

00:17:51.947 --> 00:17:54.947
Hop on in, don't be shy.

00:18:06.297 --> 00:18:09.297
Ever think about hiding
this place a little better?

00:18:09.298 --> 00:18:12.298
When was the last time
you got a VCR repaired?

00:18:12.299 --> 00:18:15.299
Point taken.

00:18:22.984 --> 00:18:26.984
That's right, you're back. Don't
wet your pants over it. Come on!

00:18:26.985 --> 00:18:28.985
We'll gonna be late.

00:18:28.986 --> 00:18:31.986
PROCTOR to start job
for some closure.

00:18:35.126 --> 00:18:38.126
Come in!

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.160
Disappointing turn out, huh?

00:19:02.161 --> 00:19:05.161
Expected more?

00:19:09.457 --> 00:19:11.457
We got a lot to talk about.

00:19:11.458 --> 00:19:16.458
But for now, im just gonna to step back
and let you soak it in for a minute.

00:19:20.925 --> 00:19:23.925
This moment is not about me.
This is about you.

00:19:23.926 --> 00:19:26.926
Letting go.

00:19:26.927 --> 00:19:29.927
Thank you for letting
me soaked it in.

00:19:43.271 --> 00:19:46.271
I'll wait for you. Alright.

00:19:46.272 --> 00:19:49.272
You know what my funeral was?

00:19:49.273 --> 00:19:53.273
Of some a bunch of coyote's,
picked my carcas clean,

00:19:53.274 --> 00:19:56.274
and dragged my bones
off into a cave.

00:19:57.764 --> 00:20:00.764
Freaking cave of.

00:20:04.378 --> 00:20:07.378
Here it comes.

00:20:07.379 --> 00:20:09.379
Becareful now!

00:20:17.136 --> 00:20:22.136
Hey! Come on! Watch it!

00:20:22.137 --> 00:20:25.137
Julia! Julia!

00:20:25.138 --> 00:20:30.138
I'm here and I don't
know how but I'm here.

00:20:30.139 --> 00:20:33.139
I'm sorry but I don't know you.

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.140
Can we just talk or
we'd just go somewhere?

00:20:36.141 --> 00:20:39.141
Julia! Hey Julia!

00:20:39.142 --> 00:20:44.142
What's your problem? Huh?

00:20:44.143 --> 00:20:47.143
Piece of shit! Piece of shit!

00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:51.932
Back on the meth's place.

00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:06.860
That went well.

00:21:07.861 --> 00:21:09.861
I knew something
is asked for you.

00:21:09.862 --> 00:21:12.862
What just happened? How
could she not know it's me?

00:21:12.863 --> 00:21:17.863
To them, you don't look like
you, you don't sound like you.

00:21:17.864 --> 00:21:20.864
If you try to tell them who you
are comes out all garbled out.

00:21:20.865 --> 00:21:23.865
The Universe and it's ultimate wisdom,
would not let you revealed yourself.

00:21:23.866 --> 00:21:25.866
It's smarter than us.

00:21:25.867 --> 00:21:27.867
That's sick.

00:21:27.868 --> 00:21:30.868
Consider it The Universe
Witness Protection program.

00:21:30.869 --> 00:21:32.869
So what do I look like?

00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:35.870
Here. These are your ID's.

00:21:38.004 --> 00:21:42.004
Some federals, lot of utilities.
Whatever get us access.

00:21:42.005 --> 00:21:45.005
Really? An old Chinese guy?

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:49.734
What about you?

00:21:53.609 --> 00:21:55.609
Like I see you win Roy.

00:22:28.859 --> 00:22:32.859
Let me bring you up to speed
with what's on my plate.

00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.860
When you ride with me,
You ride with the best.

00:22:35.861 --> 00:22:39.861
Pace as lightning,
Expectation high.

00:22:39.862 --> 00:22:43.862
Things are gonna come at you fast. They
gonna come hard. They gonna come wet.

00:22:43.863 --> 00:22:49.863
Wet? Learn to drive Bimbo!

00:22:49.864 --> 00:22:52.864
You've done this before?
Driving?

00:22:52.865 --> 00:22:56.865
Ah! You're gonna get your feet
wet, with the standard pickup.

00:22:56.866 --> 00:23:01.866
Found the suspect, Test 'em.
See if these a Dead'O.

00:23:04.734 --> 00:23:08.734
And then... Look at the
ankles on that girl.

00:23:08.735 --> 00:23:11.735
That's what you're into. Ankles?
That's what does it for you?

00:23:11.736 --> 00:23:14.736
In my days women dress
up in certainty.

00:23:14.737 --> 00:23:17.737
That makes you real ass creepy.

00:23:17.738 --> 00:23:20.738
When exactly was your day?

00:23:20.739 --> 00:23:22.739
1800 buddy.

00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.740
I'm what we used
to call a lawman.

00:23:25.741 --> 00:23:28.741
Marshall Roycephus Pulsifer.

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:30.742
Roycephus?

00:23:30.743 --> 00:23:32.743
It's considered a very
sexy name at that time.

00:23:32.744 --> 00:23:34.744
Sounds like an S.T.D. [Sexual
Transmitted Disease]

00:23:37.726 --> 00:23:41.726
Would you care to drive?

00:23:41.727 --> 00:23:47.727
I didn't get a peek at your wife's ankle.
Not one more word about her.

00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:51.728
Listen Rook, You better work
on getting a little distance.

00:23:51.729 --> 00:23:54.729
Because you too are over.

00:23:54.730 --> 00:23:56.730
You just worry about
yourself partner.

00:23:56.731 --> 00:23:58.476
Woah, you ain't my partner Rook.

00:23:58.477 --> 00:24:01.731
You're just the ass on that
other seat till I say contrary.

00:24:01.732 --> 00:24:05.732
I had a partner. Greatest
man I'd ever knew.

00:24:05.733 --> 00:24:08.733
Not up until he shot
me in the back.

00:24:08.734 --> 00:24:10.734
This is what partners
will get to.

00:24:10.735 --> 00:24:13.735
Tell me about it. How do
you think I got here?

00:24:13.736 --> 00:24:15.736
You got shot with
a modern bullet.

00:24:15.737 --> 00:24:17.737
I would have liked a modern bullet.
Sanitary glazed.

00:24:17.738 --> 00:24:22.738
That's exactly how it felt as
passed through my face. Sanitary.

00:24:22.739 --> 00:24:25.739
The term partner
died when I did.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.740
You got it Roycephus.

00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:28.741
Roycephus!

00:24:28.742 --> 00:24:29.742
Cephus.

00:24:29.743 --> 00:24:30.743
Just call me Roy.

00:24:30.744 --> 00:24:31.744
I was going to do that.

00:24:31.745 --> 00:24:32.745
Roycephus.

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:39.230
Listen up! This
is tactical Rook.

00:24:39.231 --> 00:24:42.231
Tactical? A bag
of Indian food.

00:24:42.232 --> 00:24:46.232
Yup. Got a tip on a possible
Dead'O in this building.

00:24:46.233 --> 00:24:48.233
Now listen and learn.

00:24:48.234 --> 00:24:49.234
Dead'O.

00:24:49.235 --> 00:24:52.235
Full of awful bad dead Mojo.

00:24:52.236 --> 00:24:55.236
Effect everything with
their soul stacked.

00:24:55.237 --> 00:24:58.237
Effect everything for the worse.

00:24:58.238 --> 00:24:59.238
People and things.

00:25:01.692 --> 00:25:06.692
There you go. Broken shits
is a dead give away.

00:25:18.312 --> 00:25:21.312
Soul killers.

00:25:21.313 --> 00:25:24.313
Hit a Dead'O in the
head with one of this.

00:25:24.314 --> 00:25:27.314
And it's got to be the head. First
half on the face most rectified.

00:25:27.315 --> 00:25:29.315
You're raised from the cosmos.

00:25:29.316 --> 00:25:34.316
All the life ones would hurt us, see be
extra careful where you point that thing.

00:25:34.317 --> 00:25:36.317
You saw my gun ain't on safety.

00:25:36.318 --> 00:25:39.318
It. Ankle piece is strappin'.

00:25:39.319 --> 00:25:42.319
Like world gun don't
do deadly squats here.

00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.320
You keep your eyes off my ankles.
Thank you.

00:25:53.637 --> 00:25:55.637
This out.

00:26:01.175 --> 00:26:05.175
Even more promising.

00:26:24.819 --> 00:26:27.819
It's always the quiet one.

00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:30.820
You ready? You pumped?

00:26:30.821 --> 00:26:33.821
Need you out here. Get your snowman on.
Get frosty.

00:26:33.822 --> 00:26:35.822
Alert. I'd say hot.

00:26:35.823 --> 00:26:38.823
Is this you try to
sound like a cop?

00:26:38.824 --> 00:26:40.824
This throws up a lot
of red flags for me.

00:26:40.825 --> 00:26:43.825
Got to learn the lingo umbrido.

00:26:43.826 --> 00:26:45.826
I'm frosty.

00:26:45.827 --> 00:26:47.827
Don't worry about it.

00:26:47.828 --> 00:26:50.828
Senior Officer gets
to knock Rook.

00:26:50.829 --> 00:26:53.829
I've got 15 years in the force
knock off the Rookie bullshit.

00:26:53.830 --> 00:26:58.830
Oh, you've done this before. You know
what's waiting for you behind the door.

00:26:58.831 --> 00:27:02.831
You can take your 15 years and you
can throw it down the toilet.

00:27:02.832 --> 00:27:05.832
Because this, ain't that.

00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:08.833
I'll knock you do the cards.

00:27:22.105 --> 00:27:26.105
Stanley Nawicky, We're with
the Department Of Health.

00:27:26.106 --> 00:27:29.106
Is there a problem?

00:27:29.107 --> 00:27:34.107
Oh, nothing Narwicky. We suspect
that you might be dead.

00:27:34.108 --> 00:27:39.108
Is this really necassary? No offense
but, you sounds kindda crazy.

00:27:39.109 --> 00:27:42.109
Point taken. It's just a routine test.
By your hair.

00:27:42.110 --> 00:27:44.110
I am not dead.

00:27:44.111 --> 00:27:47.111
I meant that's laugh but
check my pulse go ahead.

00:27:47.112 --> 00:27:50.112
Rook, first question.

00:27:50.113 --> 00:27:58.113
It's late on ash Wednesday an
Asian teenager in slumdog Acura.

00:27:58.114 --> 00:28:01.114
Offers you a plate
of Chicken Vindaloo.

00:28:01.115 --> 00:28:03.115
Do you accept?

00:28:03.116 --> 00:28:06.116
How am I supposed
to answer that?

00:28:06.117 --> 00:28:09.117
Oh you tell me.

00:28:11.677 --> 00:28:14.677
Okay, the answer is no.

00:28:14.678 --> 00:28:16.678
What's the problem?

00:28:16.679 --> 00:28:18.679
Is it the teenager? Yes?

00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.680
Is it the Japanese
performance to dance?

00:28:21.681 --> 00:28:24.681
Perhaps means the Indian food.

00:28:24.682 --> 00:28:28.682
Maybe he hates Indian.

00:28:28.683 --> 00:28:32.684
No. That's a... Card.

00:28:32.685 --> 00:28:36.185
The teenager is Armenian.
The day is Rosh Hashanah.

00:28:36.186 --> 00:28:39.685
The dish is SAAG PANEER.

00:28:39.686 --> 00:28:42.686
I don't want it.

00:28:42.687 --> 00:28:44.687
Why not?

00:28:44.688 --> 00:28:47.688
Is it spicy? Too mushy?

00:28:49.043 --> 00:28:52.043
You. You can't eat
during an interview.

00:28:52.044 --> 00:28:54.044
I... I don't want anyone.

00:28:54.045 --> 00:28:56.045
You don't what?

00:28:57.046 --> 00:28:58.046
Card!

00:28:58.047 --> 00:29:01.244
The car is a lime green Scion.
The season is the solstice.

00:29:01.245 --> 00:29:03.047
The dish is CHICKEN
TIKKA MASALA.

00:29:03.048 --> 00:29:06.048
No! Yes. Yes it is!

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:07.569
It's Chicken Tikka!
It's Chicken Tikka!

00:29:11.982 --> 00:29:14.982
Oh yeah! That's a Dead'O.

00:29:14.983 --> 00:29:17.983
Big O' mouth coming in.

00:29:17.984 --> 00:29:19.984
Snitch in life.

00:29:19.985 --> 00:29:22.985
Seen him like that.
Metaphorical.

00:29:22.986 --> 00:29:25.986
For some reasons Indian foods
seems to do the trick.

00:29:25.987 --> 00:29:28.987
Maybe it's the Kuma.

00:29:28.988 --> 00:29:30.988
You can bag this one.
My treat.

00:29:30.989 --> 00:29:32.989
No! Im not going
anywhere near that.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:35.990
Where is that 15
years now frosty?

00:29:35.991 --> 00:29:40.991
Gotta get comfortable with the
visual in the smell profile.

00:29:40.992 --> 00:29:45.992
Alright, spread them.
Come on. Let's go.

00:29:45.993 --> 00:29:48.993
Hurry up. Let's get
this over with.

00:29:48.994 --> 00:29:50.994
That won't be a problem
when all is over.

00:29:51.995 --> 00:29:52.995
Spread pal.

00:29:54.996 --> 00:29:57.996
Put all your hands
behind your back.

00:29:59.570 --> 00:30:01.570
Stupid space cuffs.

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:10.359
Hey!

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.360
No!

00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:19.460
You want it?

00:30:19.461 --> 00:30:22.461
You got it!

00:30:22.462 --> 00:30:28.462
Here! Grab him! Get
the rest of him!

00:30:39.256 --> 00:30:41.256
Oh shit!

00:30:53.748 --> 00:30:55.748
Where he's at? Pun head!

00:31:01.372 --> 00:31:03.372
Relax your body!

00:31:03.373 --> 00:31:04.373
What?

00:31:05.374 --> 00:31:07.374
Relax money!

00:31:16.846 --> 00:31:19.846
Give me a reason.

00:31:19.847 --> 00:31:22.847
Time to find for me a good one.
Had to make me give him a chance.

00:31:26.205 --> 00:31:30.205
Might have notice we're pretty durable.
It still hurts!

00:31:30.206 --> 00:31:33.206
That's what works the bottom.

00:31:35.907 --> 00:31:36.907
Bottom?

00:31:44.347 --> 00:31:47.347
Okay. That's mostly
understable.

00:32:00.242 --> 00:32:03.242
You'd really gonna
run it through that?

00:32:17.820 --> 00:32:19.820
Brief after action report.

00:32:19.821 --> 00:32:22.821
Now, we blow within the room.

00:32:22.822 --> 00:32:27.822
But you did respond well to my
steering during the airbone portion.

00:32:27.823 --> 00:32:31.823
Your internal organs provided
me a very soft landing.

00:32:31.824 --> 00:32:36.824
You have a very
impressive crumples up.

00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:39.825
With the exception of letting yourself
get attached directly to the.

00:32:40.826 --> 00:32:43.826
Stop talking. You were solid.

00:32:43.827 --> 00:32:46.827
C plus. Stop talking.

00:32:46.828 --> 00:32:47.828
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop talking!

00:32:47.829 --> 00:32:48.829
You're the one who's talking.

00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:50.830
You ran your mouth
at my funeral.

00:32:50.831 --> 00:32:52.831
You ran your mouth when you
pushed me out of the building.

00:32:52.832 --> 00:32:57.832
You run your mouth non-stop
since the minute we met.

00:32:57.833 --> 00:33:00.833
No! No! No! Shut up.

00:33:00.834 --> 00:33:02.834
Shut up and let me deal.

00:33:02.835 --> 00:33:05.835
Oh! You deal! You deal
with the up Chuck.

00:33:05.836 --> 00:33:09.836
Come to think of it. With
all this tantruming.

00:33:09.837 --> 00:33:12.837
I'm begining to think that im a little
too generous from a plus from that C.

00:33:12.838 --> 00:33:15.838
I'm just to lower your grade.

00:33:15.839 --> 00:33:18.839
Relax body.

00:33:23.719 --> 00:33:26.719
My hat!

00:33:27.454 --> 00:33:29.454
My hat!

00:33:29.455 --> 00:33:32.455
My hat!

00:33:36.651 --> 00:33:39.651
You brave. F.

00:33:39.652 --> 00:33:42.652
Bus I can forgive. My hat.

00:33:42.653 --> 00:33:45.653
Can't even talk about that now.

00:33:45.654 --> 00:33:47.654
Go! Go! Go! Tiny as a package.
Let's go.

00:33:47.655 --> 00:33:50.655
The hell is this?
A fire drill?

00:33:50.656 --> 00:33:51.710
Never seen anything this busy.

00:33:51.711 --> 00:33:53.656
Seems like every Dead'O
to Boston last week.

00:33:53.657 --> 00:33:55.657
What did I say? Get
back out there.

00:33:56.658 --> 00:33:58.658
No breaks for everyone till
the surge is under control.

00:33:58.659 --> 00:34:00.659
If I didn't need you
back on the streets...

00:34:00.660 --> 00:34:03.660
What? You have my ass?
Dont be a clich'e.

00:34:03.661 --> 00:34:05.661
You let them get at the window.
Aren't you better than them?

00:34:05.662 --> 00:34:08.662
You're the one who put me with
the training wheels here.

00:34:08.663 --> 00:34:10.663
Be gone. Make
yourself being boss.

00:34:10.664 --> 00:34:13.664
Still large on the boss part.
Don't you?

00:34:13.665 --> 00:34:15.665
That's the game That's
what you wanted.

00:34:15.666 --> 00:34:17.666
I don't play the game.

00:34:17.667 --> 00:34:20.667
And my ass is mine
and mine alone!

00:34:20.668 --> 00:34:22.668
Ignorant!

00:34:22.669 --> 00:34:24.669
Come on! Glad anyway.

00:34:29.450 --> 00:34:32.450
Roy! Narwicky was trying awfully
hard to protect this gold.

00:34:32.451 --> 00:34:34.451
Don't you think we should try
to figure out what it is?

00:34:34.452 --> 00:34:36.452
Trust me it's nothing.

00:34:36.453 --> 00:34:39.453
The man in that these things. Is just
fundraising at 'em from various religions.

00:34:39.454 --> 00:34:42.454
Just crap!

00:34:42.455 --> 00:34:45.455
What about the one percent?

00:34:45.456 --> 00:34:46.456
That's why we locked
'em up in here.

00:34:46.457 --> 00:34:49.457
Bag it. Tag it and burried deep.

00:34:49.458 --> 00:34:51.458
Is that all of it? That's it.

00:34:51.459 --> 00:34:53.459
Sign here please.

00:35:18.553 --> 00:35:20.553
Roy! Listen. What?

00:35:20.554 --> 00:35:22.979
Narwicky cared an awful
lot about that gold.

00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:23.554
Yeah.

00:35:23.555 --> 00:35:26.555
He was trying to hide it from us.
Why?

00:35:26.556 --> 00:35:29.556
So now you're gung-ho huh?

00:35:29.557 --> 00:35:31.557
I'm... I'm thinking
we should follow up.

00:35:31.558 --> 00:35:34.558
Let me guess,
Genius has a plan.

00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:36.559
Genius wants to get off
the street and work this.

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:38.560
I think you could help me with that.
You know why?

00:35:38.561 --> 00:35:41.561
Because every great cop
that I've ever known.

00:35:41.562 --> 00:35:43.562
Has their own informant.

00:35:43.563 --> 00:35:46.563
Big Roy! I meant Big Roy
ain't gotta have one.

00:35:51.484 --> 00:35:53.584
You want an informant?

00:35:53.585 --> 00:35:55.585
Big Roy got the best informant.

00:36:02.207 --> 00:36:04.207
Red socks. Number 34. Damn!

00:36:04.711 --> 00:36:07.711
Eliot! You're pain
in the ass Dead'O.

00:36:07.712 --> 00:36:10.712
All he cares about is the socks.

00:36:10.713 --> 00:36:13.713
So, I'll let him stick around
in exchange for information.

00:36:15.693 --> 00:36:17.693
Here!

00:36:18.756 --> 00:36:21.756
You're in mourning.
Got a hole to fill.

00:36:25.219 --> 00:36:27.219
You know, I can't
taste anything.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:29.220
Of course not! You're dead.

00:36:29.221 --> 00:36:31.221
R.I.P.D. don't eat
we don't sleep.

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:34.222
We're here to kick Dead'O ass.
That's about it.

00:36:34.223 --> 00:36:37.223
Then why would you eat this?
I enjoyed the mouth feel.

00:36:43.989 --> 00:36:45.989
How's it going Eliot?

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.990
We're up. But the
hitline crap.

00:36:48.991 --> 00:36:50.991
We'll blow it.

00:36:50.992 --> 00:36:52.992
Knock yourself out.

00:36:52.993 --> 00:36:54.993
Hello Eliot.

00:36:54.994 --> 00:36:57.994
One of your buddies, well
gets erased for this. Why?

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:03.210
Rook...

00:37:05.869 --> 00:37:07.869
That belongs to the evidence.

00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:09.870
I thought you were some
kind of rebel Roy?

00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:11.871
I fought for the more.

00:37:11.872 --> 00:37:15.872
Would you mind terribly. If I
got back to my investigations?

00:37:15.873 --> 00:37:17.873
Go continue your investigations.

00:37:22.861 --> 00:37:24.861
Tell me what this is Eliot.

00:37:24.862 --> 00:37:26.862
That looks like a
big hunk of gold.

00:37:26.863 --> 00:37:28.863
Hahaha. It's not gonna
cut it try again.

00:37:30.137 --> 00:37:33.137
Hey! Hey! Get your
hands off me.

00:37:33.138 --> 00:37:35.138
You behave yourself now Eliot.

00:37:35.139 --> 00:37:38.139
'Cause of me you're sitting there all
cozy in that land in the pun box.

00:37:38.140 --> 00:37:42.140
Not opening a desert trying to get
your fingers back from the coyote.

00:37:42.141 --> 00:37:47.141
You cops are all the same. Always
obssesed in about how you bid it.

00:37:47.142 --> 00:37:50.142
How was your funeral newbie?
Did you cry?

00:37:50.143 --> 00:37:54.143
Well they gave your wife that
nice folded up flag. Haha.

00:37:56.573 --> 00:37:59.573
Hey! That's fun right?

00:37:59.574 --> 00:38:01.574
I think we both know there is
no red socks on either sides.

00:38:01.575 --> 00:38:03.575
So why don't you co-operate?

00:38:03.576 --> 00:38:06.576
I apologize for
my poor attitude.

00:38:06.577 --> 00:38:09.577
May I take a closer look Sir?

00:38:09.578 --> 00:38:12.578
You may.

00:38:18.051 --> 00:38:21.051
Yeah well look, I'm sorry to
disappoint but this is crap.

00:38:21.052 --> 00:38:24.052
Look, Dead'O they're
sentimental.

00:38:24.053 --> 00:38:27.053
Lots of them believe in
this talismatic junk.

00:38:27.054 --> 00:38:31.054
For something else there
be some chatter out there.

00:38:31.055 --> 00:38:33.055
I would know.

00:38:33.056 --> 00:38:35.056
Alright. We're done here.

00:38:35.057 --> 00:38:37.057
These hats are crap.

00:38:37.058 --> 00:38:40.058
Keep your heads
up and inform me.

00:38:40.059 --> 00:38:43.059
Yes Sir.

00:38:51.972 --> 00:38:53.972
You gave him the gold?

00:38:53.973 --> 00:38:55.973
He seems squirm. We got him.

00:38:55.974 --> 00:38:57.974
Got him? What do you
meant we got him?

00:38:57.975 --> 00:38:58.975
What we get?

00:38:58.976 --> 00:39:00.976
Tell you what he got.
He got the gold.

00:39:00.977 --> 00:39:02.977
Which you gave him.

00:39:02.978 --> 00:39:04.978
What the hell is the
matter with you?

00:39:04.979 --> 00:39:06.979
I'm pissed about my hat.

00:39:11.226 --> 00:39:13.226
There, looky looky.

00:39:15.543 --> 00:39:17.543
I'm gonna teach you
modern law enforcement.

00:39:17.544 --> 00:39:19.544
This is called giving
the dog a bone.

00:39:19.545 --> 00:39:21.545
Bones?

00:39:31.912 --> 00:39:33.912
What he's doing?

00:39:35.606 --> 00:39:39.606
Okay. That's weird. 'Cause that
looks exactly like your ex-partner.

00:39:39.607 --> 00:39:41.607
The one who shot you dead.

00:39:47.474 --> 00:39:50.474
Okay. I'm interested.
Caller me interested.

00:39:54.902 --> 00:39:56.902
He might be chasing you huh?

00:40:00.409 --> 00:40:03.409
First the guy smoking like a knuck worse.
Now we got guys just handing him gold.

00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:05.410
Let me think. Just
let me think.

00:40:05.411 --> 00:40:09.411
What's there to think about? The man
just screwing you from left to right.

00:40:09.412 --> 00:40:12.412
Your own partner.

00:40:25.853 --> 00:40:27.853
And the trifecta.

00:40:27.854 --> 00:40:30.854
Sleeping with your wife.

00:40:30.855 --> 00:40:33.855
'Cause this is your
house isn't it?

00:40:33.856 --> 00:40:36.856
Total humiliation.

00:40:36.857 --> 00:40:38.857
Just don't pass down
in the supermarket.

00:40:41.370 --> 00:40:44.370
He's not sleeping with Julia.

00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.750
Wanna bet?

00:40:47.751 --> 00:40:50.751
Yeah let's... Winner shoots the loser
in the face as many time as he wants.

00:40:50.752 --> 00:40:53.752
Not a hundred percent
confident winning the read.

00:40:56.978 --> 00:40:58.978
Something always from Mike's.

00:40:58.979 --> 00:41:02.979
Seeing how Nick's used to make
us stop and getting for it.

00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.980
Thank you. Thank you Bobby.

00:41:09.699 --> 00:41:12.699
Hey Julia. Nick seems
alright to you?

00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:17.700
Isn't he concerned
about anything?

00:41:17.701 --> 00:41:22.701
No. Okay. Okay.

00:41:23.895 --> 00:41:27.895
Why? I'm sorry I got
to do this now.

00:41:27.896 --> 00:41:30.896
Nick said he burried something.

00:41:33.319 --> 00:41:36.319
If he's not sleeping with her, It's
kindda funny he's here isn't it?

00:41:37.529 --> 00:41:41.529
Unless you got is half a pack scrubbing
for porn of your laptop for you.

00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:43.530
I get that.

00:41:43.531 --> 00:41:46.531
Classic actually.

00:41:51.232 --> 00:41:53.232
He gave this to me.
He knew I wanted it.

00:41:53.233 --> 00:41:57.233
What are you saying? That he just did
this to hide something under it?

00:41:57.234 --> 00:42:00.234
I don't know. But I
got to take a look.

00:42:13.362 --> 00:42:16.362
I was hoping I was wrong.

00:42:23.168 --> 00:42:26.168
Just he stole this?
Oh God I feel sick.

00:42:26.169 --> 00:42:29.169
You crook son of a bitch.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:32.170
When were you going to
tell me about this?

00:42:32.171 --> 00:42:34.171
Put the gun down. Shut up.

00:42:34.172 --> 00:42:35.672
Just get it away from me.
I don't want to see it.

00:42:35.673 --> 00:42:39.673
Don't worry. Don't worry about a thing.
He was my best friend.

00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:43.824
I don't even knew who he was.

00:42:50.752 --> 00:42:52.752
Get off from me or
I break your legs.

00:42:52.753 --> 00:42:54.753
Explanation now.

00:42:54.754 --> 00:42:58.755
We spli... We took something.

00:42:58.756 --> 00:43:00.256
From a bunch of shit
rats who would have

00:43:00.257 --> 00:43:01.756
turned into guns or drugs
or who knows what.

00:43:01.757 --> 00:43:03.757
It was a victim of crime.
End of story.

00:43:03.758 --> 00:43:05.758
Why would the Dead'O want it?

00:43:05.759 --> 00:43:08.759
You think and I know
about this Dead'O shit?

00:43:08.760 --> 00:43:11.760
It was just money that me, I was
trying to make our lives better.

00:43:11.761 --> 00:43:14.761
Alright you did a good
job of that didn't ya?

00:43:14.762 --> 00:43:17.762
Why don't you go and
try thing again.

00:43:17.763 --> 00:43:19.763
Explain it to her,
that went well.

00:43:22.093 --> 00:43:24.093
Try it again. If
it makes you...

00:43:25.666 --> 00:43:27.666
Gold's getting away.

00:44:07.781 --> 00:44:09.781
Come on. Tighten it up.

00:44:09.782 --> 00:44:11.782
My wife sees me as
a piece of shit.

00:44:11.783 --> 00:44:14.783
Actually she sees you
as an old Chinese guy.

00:44:14.784 --> 00:44:17.784
By the way granpa Chin
pretty solid look.

00:44:17.785 --> 00:44:20.785
Help you stay stakeouts.

00:44:23.109 --> 00:44:26.109
The only thing I ever cared about
is what she thought of me.

00:44:26.110 --> 00:44:27.110
Is all that matters.

00:44:27.111 --> 00:44:29.111
The only thing which
she thinks...

00:44:29.112 --> 00:44:32.112
That's who I am. I blew that.

00:44:32.113 --> 00:44:34.113
Destroyed it.

00:44:34.114 --> 00:44:35.114
Boo hoo.

00:44:35.115 --> 00:44:37.115
You heard me, Boody hoo.

00:44:43.037 --> 00:44:46.037
You might be the worst
person I've ever met.

00:44:46.038 --> 00:44:49.038
Sadly, you do not get to tell
her how you did it all for her.

00:44:49.039 --> 00:44:54.039
And where exactly do you think you tragedy
ranks on the scales cosmic of injustice?

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.040
Pakistan earthquake level?

00:44:57.041 --> 00:44:59.041
Killing tiers level? To
me it was pretty big.

00:44:59.042 --> 00:45:02.042
You're playing you're the only
who was cut down in his prime?

00:45:02.043 --> 00:45:07.043
You think I felt unresolved as my
as my face was being devowed by a.

00:45:07.044 --> 00:45:08.044
Oh Christ.

00:45:08.045 --> 00:45:11.045
You just gonna have to learn to
sit on your regret and pain.

00:45:11.046 --> 00:45:14.046
And turned the things
to adult persistence.

00:45:14.047 --> 00:45:17.047
The way I do it. The
way im handles it.

00:45:25.677 --> 00:45:30.677
I do music videos my phone
numbers is on the back.

00:45:30.678 --> 00:45:32.678
Excuse me,

00:45:32.679 --> 00:45:37.679
Im not a piece of meat put on this
earth for your gratification.

00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:38.680
I'm a woman.

00:45:38.681 --> 00:45:41.681
Respect me or I'll castrate you
like a three year old stair.

00:45:46.888 --> 00:45:48.888
Look sharp. We got something.

00:46:02.905 --> 00:46:04.905
Oh yeah. That's a Dead'O.

00:46:04.906 --> 00:46:06.906
That has got to be his friends.

00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.260
You stay on the gold.
I got it.

00:46:26.261 --> 00:46:28.261
Hold up. That is on point.
No thanks.

00:46:28.262 --> 00:46:29.262
Let's see you in action.

00:46:29.263 --> 00:46:32.263
You questioning my methods?
You ever have a method?

00:46:42.439 --> 00:46:44.439
Excuse me Sir, but word.

00:46:46.634 --> 00:46:48.634
Freezer.

00:46:51.351 --> 00:46:53.351
Allow me.

00:46:53.352 --> 00:46:55.352
My bad.

00:47:00.317 --> 00:47:02.317
Let me guess, R.I.P.D. Huh?

00:47:05.881 --> 00:47:07.881
Great looks man.

00:47:07.882 --> 00:47:09.882
You and your spadex
expresso and...

00:47:09.883 --> 00:47:11.883
Easy with the razor.

00:47:11.884 --> 00:47:15.884
You with your magnificent breast.
Watch it.

00:47:17.630 --> 00:47:20.630
Hey sideburns, tell
us about the gold.

00:47:22.194 --> 00:47:25.194
Look, we're friends here.

00:47:25.195 --> 00:47:28.195
Help each other out.

00:47:28.196 --> 00:47:31.196
You don't wanna get pop. I
don't want to popped here.

00:47:31.197 --> 00:47:32.197
Oh you don't?

00:47:32.198 --> 00:47:34.198
No. As soon as you
give us that case.

00:47:34.199 --> 00:47:37.199
You got to start talking and
you keep to be roaming around.

00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.200
With your bitch and
ginger sideburns.

00:47:43.822 --> 00:47:48.823
You know what... I'm
sick of hiding.

00:47:57.798 --> 00:48:00.798
Thank you. Thank
you very much.

00:48:08.434 --> 00:48:10.434
Hell yeah.

00:48:10.435 --> 00:48:12.435
Let's do this.

00:48:34.201 --> 00:48:36.201
Suck it!

00:48:42.346 --> 00:48:44.346
Straight butt!

00:48:44.347 --> 00:48:46.347
Come on!

00:48:47.224 --> 00:48:50.224
Lower your pants. Have
some butt roping to do.

00:49:15.005 --> 00:49:17.005
Okay.

00:49:17.006 --> 00:49:19.006
Are you okay?
Somebody call 911.

00:49:19.007 --> 00:49:22.007
I'm okay. Nothing to see.
Got to go.

00:49:37.904 --> 00:49:40.904
Idiot! Aim for the head!

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:52.619
Hell yeah. You son of a bitch.

00:50:00.692 --> 00:50:02.692
Aw, my ass.

00:50:02.693 --> 00:50:04.693
What is that?

00:50:54.883 --> 00:50:56.883
Relax body.

00:51:43.201 --> 00:51:45.201
Rook!

00:51:46.708 --> 00:51:49.708
Over here! If not
too much trouble.

00:51:58.792 --> 00:52:00.792
Thank you very much.

00:52:02.507 --> 00:52:04.507
I've never seen one
like that before.

00:52:04.508 --> 00:52:07.954
Never. Never before
has this happen.

00:52:07.955 --> 00:52:10.955
Congratulations guys on
your unprecedented cock-up.

00:52:11.911 --> 00:52:13.911
You let an exposed Dead'O
loose on the street.

00:52:13.912 --> 00:52:15.912
In the middle of the day.

00:52:15.913 --> 00:52:17.422
You're supposed to contain.
That is your most

00:52:17.423 --> 00:52:18.913
basic job you failed
spectacularly to contain.

00:52:18.914 --> 00:52:21.914
All right pretty
five was different.

00:52:21.915 --> 00:52:24.915
We have evidence. As on
of their bunch of...

00:52:24.916 --> 00:52:26.200
Don't get creative. You
do as you're told.

00:52:26.201 --> 00:52:28.201
When you don't this happens.

00:52:28.202 --> 00:52:32.649
Terrifying whatever rampage through the
streets of Boston today was not human.

00:52:33.226 --> 00:52:36.226
Now look where we are. You
get to deal with them.

00:52:36.227 --> 00:52:38.607
Who in this endless streams
of freaks is them?

00:52:38.608 --> 00:52:41.314
Eternal Affairs.
Hammers dropping.

00:53:03.678 --> 00:53:05.678
Well?

00:53:05.796 --> 00:53:07.166
They're pissed.

00:53:07.167 --> 00:53:11.220
Justify apparently stumbled
across something important.

00:53:11.553 --> 00:53:13.553
Don't act too surprised
onr it boss.

00:53:14.479 --> 00:53:18.355
The gold that Officers Pulsifer
and Walker brought in are part of

00:53:18.356 --> 00:53:22.090
an incredibly dangerous artifact
known as the Staff of Jericho.

00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:28.180
Oh, crap!

00:53:31.133 --> 00:53:34.133
Maybe feather in for the new guy?
A little bit?

00:53:34.134 --> 00:53:38.081
Remember the tunnel we pull
you out of when you died?

00:53:38.082 --> 00:53:40.815
That's the only way to
get to the afterlife.

00:53:40.816 --> 00:53:42.038
One way street.

00:53:42.039 --> 00:53:45.525
This artifact if build,
reverses the tunnel.

00:53:45.526 --> 00:53:46.935
The dead reign down
on this earth,

00:53:46.936 --> 00:53:49.333
That's it for the living world.

00:53:49.334 --> 00:53:53.047
Massive destruction we broke
into pieces 3000 years ago.

00:53:53.048 --> 00:53:54.048
Now it's back.

00:53:54.049 --> 00:53:56.725
Till we got the rest of the
gold, we're on red alert.

00:53:56.726 --> 00:53:59.720
Also apparently you need
the blood of enemy.

00:53:59.721 --> 00:54:01.097
There are more diagrams.

00:54:01.098 --> 00:54:02.098
Why?

00:54:02.099 --> 00:54:05.156
Why? Why would someone
make something like that?

00:54:05.157 --> 00:54:10.576
Come on! Here I am willing
the streets into order...

00:54:10.577 --> 00:54:14.020
Making headway... Year
after dominant year.

00:54:14.021 --> 00:54:16.398
And now everything
I've done is being

00:54:16.399 --> 00:54:19.220
threatened because of
some ancient for kids

00:54:19.221 --> 00:54:21.567
by some asshole 5000 years ago?

00:54:21.568 --> 00:54:25.214
Why even try? How am
I supposed to do it?

00:54:27.573 --> 00:54:30.019
Look Jesus, You're
proud of yourself.

00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:32.737
I got an important too.

00:54:38.154 --> 00:54:40.154
What?

00:54:40.155 --> 00:54:42.155
Well... What is it?

00:54:45.580 --> 00:54:47.580
Actually...

00:54:47.581 --> 00:54:51.724
It looks like, you two don't need to
concern yourself with the red alert.

00:54:51.725 --> 00:54:53.865
It brings me no pleasure.

00:54:53.866 --> 00:54:57.644
To inform you because of
your recent epic failure,

00:54:57.645 --> 00:54:59.365
You both been suspended
you're off the case.

00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:03.585
Hold on a second.
We are the case.

00:55:03.586 --> 00:55:05.505
We're the ones who
brought it in.

00:55:05.506 --> 00:55:07.758
I'm feeling that was involved
there would be a formal

00:55:07.759 --> 00:55:10.224
hearing tomorrow after which
you're most likely to be erased.

00:55:10.617 --> 00:55:12.617
Erased?

00:55:14.205 --> 00:55:19.546
In this moment of clashes. They're going to
suspend and then erase their best Officer?

00:55:19.547 --> 00:55:22.115
And this other guy.

00:55:22.116 --> 00:55:23.694
Better Officers are taking over.

00:55:23.695 --> 00:55:25.587
No such thing name one.

00:55:25.588 --> 00:55:30.261
Jacobson, Dubo, Watterson,
Carson, Jackson.

00:55:30.262 --> 00:55:30.928
Pretty good.

00:55:30.929 --> 00:55:33.405
That guy who works at the taco card.
Shall I go on?

00:55:33.406 --> 00:55:35.845
Okay Okay! So tomorrow
is my last day...

00:55:35.846 --> 00:55:38.024
Most likely.

00:55:38.025 --> 00:55:39.762
I'm sorry.

00:55:40.587 --> 00:55:45.336
Well, it's a shame. Miss Proctor
it's been a delight. Roy, Thank you

00:55:45.337 --> 00:55:48.032
very much for your mentorship
I'm sure it meant a lot to you.

00:55:48.033 --> 00:55:50.624
I got somewhere more
important to be.

00:56:26.093 --> 00:56:27.347
Who are you?

00:56:32.614 --> 00:56:34.874
Why are you following me huh?

00:56:37.305 --> 00:56:39.201
Stay away from me.

00:56:47.720 --> 00:56:50.102
I haven't left you.

00:56:55.387 --> 00:56:57.650
It's me.

00:57:02.108 --> 00:57:05.482
No...

00:57:13.593 --> 00:57:14.790
Rook...

00:57:17.091 --> 00:57:19.924
Congratulations, you
finally did it.

00:57:19.925 --> 00:57:21.854
You get what you wanted.

00:57:21.855 --> 00:57:25.211
I might get erased tomorrow what
do you think im going to do?

00:57:25.212 --> 00:57:28.028
You're freaking her out
if you haven't noticed.

00:57:28.029 --> 00:57:32.668
I'm not the time motion level.

00:57:32.669 --> 00:57:35.749
And yes in my day I bought
my love by the hour.

00:57:35.750 --> 00:57:38.927
But I do know, what you're
doing is not helping.

00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:42.890
Causing her pain.

00:57:42.891 --> 00:57:46.035
Why do you think we're here?

00:57:46.036 --> 00:57:48.281
What we do what we do.

00:57:48.282 --> 00:57:51.593
It's so that Julia can have
the a world to live in.

00:57:51.594 --> 00:57:53.727
And yeah and that
maybe that's you.

00:57:53.728 --> 00:57:59.210
She need to survive this. Meet someone new.
Maybe have a family.

00:57:59.211 --> 00:58:04.167
Because you are not coming back.
Ever!

00:58:04.168 --> 00:58:08.112
The job is all you have now. But
we don't have the job anymore.

00:58:09.325 --> 00:58:13.821
Nick, your crap.
You're like me.

00:58:13.822 --> 00:58:16.094
Like you? Yes and
you're like my piece.

00:58:16.095 --> 00:58:18.558
I'll come.

00:58:18.559 --> 00:58:21.867
Hey fucking me for a long
time won't achive this state.

00:58:21.868 --> 00:58:24.397
You can get there too
but for your weakness.

00:58:24.398 --> 00:58:29.182
I've had it. I can't listen to one more
self righteous chesnut out of your mouth.

00:58:29.183 --> 00:58:32.388
I don't want to live in
your weird past with you.

00:58:32.389 --> 00:58:38.779
Speak which, those coyote's making
ball crap out of your face.

00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.421
In that story the
coyote's are the heroes.

00:58:42.422 --> 00:58:47.873
Hey you may think.

00:58:47.874 --> 00:58:52.000
It wasn't. It was smelly.
It was violent.

00:58:52.001 --> 00:58:56.420
It was written with no count
engines I've had a lot of anger.

00:58:56.421 --> 00:58:58.561
To get past. Okay?

00:58:58.562 --> 00:59:04.740
And you, you need to bring a lot of
shit out to have been suppressing.

00:59:04.741 --> 00:59:06.918
For very long time.

00:59:12.852 --> 00:59:20.852
One of the Coyote make love to my skull. Do
you know what that practice coming to call?

00:59:21.168 --> 00:59:22.790
I do.

00:59:22.791 --> 00:59:28.492
And I certainly hope
you got both eyes Roy.

00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.656
Song is called better man.
Yeah I got that.

01:00:01.768 --> 01:00:04.632
Maybe I took things
a little too far.

01:00:04.633 --> 01:00:07.861
Maybe.

01:00:07.862 --> 01:00:12.942
I'm sorry.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:17.285
You ought take too much Nick.

01:00:17.286 --> 01:00:22.504
Spent with. Maybe
your last moments.

01:00:22.505 --> 01:00:29.879
You're right about the job Roy.

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:34.387
We got to get back out there.
In.

01:00:34.388 --> 01:00:37.084
They want me back they
gonna have to beg.

01:00:37.085 --> 01:00:39.282
I'm not going to take
this lying down you?

01:00:42.199 --> 01:00:45.113
You wanna help me stop the
you know an apocalypse.

01:00:45.114 --> 01:00:50.638
You put a bad Roy. Hell yeah
Kind of beg me into a corner.

01:00:50.639 --> 01:00:54.515
I know his that gold. There
is no way he's just a bagman.

01:00:54.516 --> 01:00:56.455
Let me ask you something.

01:00:56.456 --> 01:00:59.208
Did he like Indian food?

01:00:59.209 --> 01:01:00.538
He's not a fan.

01:01:00.539 --> 01:01:03.976
But something is bugging me.
I rode this guy for 5 years.

01:01:03.977 --> 01:01:06.740
I never noticed anykind of.

01:01:06.741 --> 01:01:07.950
Soul stank.

01:01:07.951 --> 01:01:12.755
Artifact that could masked it.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:15.424
Like a spiritual deodorant.

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:18.059
Or something he carries
with him all the time.

01:01:18.060 --> 01:01:21.680
Like grandma sacress for metal?

01:01:21.681 --> 01:01:23.134
That.

01:01:23.135 --> 01:01:29.188
Let's go pop this
son of a bitch.

01:01:49.424 --> 01:01:50.912
You know what to do?

01:01:50.913 --> 01:01:53.832
Oh yeah. Waiting a
long time for this.

01:01:53.833 --> 01:01:55.434
You wait a long time?

01:01:55.435 --> 01:01:59.441
You know how many years Dead'O have
been trying to pull this off? 3000.

01:01:59.442 --> 01:02:02.887
Not one of those could get
all that gold together.

01:02:02.888 --> 01:02:04.937
Until me.

01:02:04.938 --> 01:02:08.859
R.I.P.D is not going
to know what him 'em.

01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:14.086
Now go find yourself some trouble.
My pleasure.

01:02:26.197 --> 01:02:27.024
Hey Julia.

01:02:27.025 --> 01:02:31.283
Hey, I need to talk to you about
something really strange happened to me.

01:02:31.284 --> 01:02:33.058
What's going on?

01:02:33.059 --> 01:02:37.021
I was at the track last night. Do you
remember the guy at the funeral?

01:02:37.022 --> 01:02:40.077
The little Chinese guy.
The one who is yelling.

01:02:40.078 --> 01:02:41.763
Alright slow down. Slow down.
Take a deep breath.

01:02:41.764 --> 01:02:46.329
I don't know somehow, I feel like
it's Nick who's trying to talk to me.

01:07:43.001 --> 01:07:45.063

01:07:47.082 --> 01:07:49.293

You just put something just like this.

01:08:20.094 --> 01:08:22.398
Got to need to fill
up another form.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:27.258
Better to do.

01:08:31.812 --> 01:08:34.963
That's one decent thing
about being a Dead'O right?

01:08:34.964 --> 01:08:38.878
He can't hear certain
frequency so well.

01:08:38.879 --> 01:08:39.879
Nope.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:45.128
Roy!

01:08:54.019 --> 01:08:56.019
What the fuck?

01:09:03.462 --> 01:09:05.757
Come on Nicky, you thought I
just let you bring me here.

01:09:05.758 --> 01:09:07.389
If I don't want to
be here all along?

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:09.141
Isn't this thing sweet?

01:09:09.142 --> 01:09:11.389
Freezes you guys up.
Does nothing to us.

01:09:11.390 --> 01:09:13.769
They got one of this
artifact for everything.

01:09:17.436 --> 01:09:19.962
Go! Go! Go! Go! Come on!

01:09:19.963 --> 01:09:22.788
Split the gold. Take everything.

01:09:25.401 --> 01:09:28.680
It's all there. Uhuh.

01:09:28.681 --> 01:09:30.546
Come on!

01:09:33.730 --> 01:09:35.730
Let's go.

01:10:03.544 --> 01:10:05.544
No! The gold!

01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.912
You're boss.

01:10:10.913 --> 01:10:14.381
I got it all. I'm on it.

01:10:14.382 --> 01:10:19.555
Daddy's got gold.
Let's build it boys.

01:11:23.957 --> 01:11:27.232
Just like Main Street Dark City.

01:11:27.233 --> 01:11:32.691
Induce, they picked the wrong
venue to make a stand.

01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:38.223
I've been at this shit.

01:11:43.886 --> 01:11:45.352
Hot.

01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:58.517
Fixed it! Yeah!

01:12:13.843 --> 01:12:17.311
Let's learn you a few things
about old west fighting.

01:12:17.312 --> 01:12:24.388
First, Only a novice have to church.
First place I'm gonna look.

01:12:24.389 --> 01:12:26.804
Second place. Hotel
window everytime!

01:12:30.059 --> 01:12:32.775
I guess it's only one
novice in their crew.

01:12:35.292 --> 01:12:38.515
Sometimes the window
guy is on the roof.

01:12:56.989 --> 01:12:58.501
I haven't seen that before.

01:12:59.031 --> 01:13:02.405
Must be the massive destruction
Proctor was talking about.

01:13:02.406 --> 01:13:04.833
Buckle up!

01:13:06.861 --> 01:13:10.146
Hey Julia. Hayes sent
us to give you a lift.

01:13:10.147 --> 01:13:12.706
Guys, I can still drive.

01:13:12.707 --> 01:13:16.651
It's pretty airy out there.
He's just worried about you.

01:13:27.469 --> 01:13:28.485
Closing up.

01:13:28.827 --> 01:13:33.912
Alright bag it up. Nobody gets through
to the Commonwealth building.

01:13:33.913 --> 01:13:35.347
Nobody.

01:13:54.984 --> 01:13:57.309
Look's like the big one is right
over the Commonwealth building.

01:13:57.310 --> 01:14:00.242
That's where we're heading.
Yeah good read.

01:14:00.243 --> 01:14:05.205
You agreeing with me that's weird.
Yeah feels great!

01:14:05.206 --> 01:14:07.722
Kindda tingling.

01:14:16.508 --> 01:14:18.027
Dead'O on wheels.

01:14:18.028 --> 01:14:19.436
Oh that's disappointing.

01:14:19.437 --> 01:14:21.519
I was hoping to get a
little break here.

01:14:42.895 --> 01:14:45.213
Make it go away Nick.

01:14:59.909 --> 01:15:01.218
I got it.

01:15:06.829 --> 01:15:09.071
Holy shit!

01:15:32.281 --> 01:15:35.515
That scare the shit out of me.

01:15:35.516 --> 01:15:39.044
Get the gold up top. I gotta
wait for the final piece.

01:15:52.717 --> 01:15:53.790
Hey, you're okay?

01:15:53.791 --> 01:15:55.096
What the hell is going on?

01:15:55.097 --> 01:15:56.849
Nothing is going on. I'm
glad you're here with me.

01:15:56.850 --> 01:15:58.527
We need to get inside.

01:15:58.528 --> 01:16:02.061
Listen there's something I got to tell you.
It's something I've been hiding.

01:16:02.062 --> 01:16:05.068
Bobby I think you can wait.
Wait.

01:16:05.069 --> 01:16:07.708
But I think you just
try keep an open mind.

01:16:07.709 --> 01:16:09.785
Do not judge right well okay?

01:16:26.753 --> 01:16:30.602
Skycam 4 is on the scene
with continuing coverage.

01:16:30.603 --> 01:16:33.071
We're looking down on a
Commonwealth Building. What just

01:16:33.072 --> 01:16:35.361
warming with I really don't
know the way to say this.

01:16:35.362 --> 01:16:39.201
Monsters, I urge everyone to stay
inside until this situation...

01:16:39.202 --> 01:16:40.202
Oh Shit!

01:16:44.552 --> 01:16:46.313
Thank you.

01:16:48.374 --> 01:16:51.028
It's like they
build a barricade.

01:16:56.157 --> 01:16:57.889
And there's fat Elvis.

01:16:57.890 --> 01:17:00.168
Give him the jeeping.

01:17:18.362 --> 01:17:19.654
Not bad.

01:17:24.267 --> 01:17:25.474
Can't check me.

01:17:25.475 --> 01:17:28.497
Still hurts dicks.

01:17:31.862 --> 01:17:33.905
Relax body.

01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:45.818
Hope they have an elavator.

01:17:50.738 --> 01:17:52.194
Ah! Shit!

01:17:58.543 --> 01:18:01.608
Reverse the tunnel. The
dead come pouring back.

01:18:01.609 --> 01:18:03.877
We stay here forever.

01:18:03.878 --> 01:18:07.000
Kindda behind fine moments.

01:18:07.001 --> 01:18:12.053
All we got to do. Is
fire up this bad boy.

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:24.941
Yeah! Okay.

01:18:24.942 --> 01:18:29.047
This is where it gets a
little uncomfortable.

01:18:29.048 --> 01:18:31.875
There's no great way to say
this so, I just say it.

01:18:31.876 --> 01:18:34.923
This ancient things,
they off with element of

01:18:34.924 --> 01:18:37.919
I must say human sacrifice
but human sacrifice.

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.200
I'll jump before you
could even touch me.

01:18:40.201 --> 01:18:43.072
Julia, come on! Come on be cool.

01:18:43.073 --> 01:18:47.478
This is an honor, im trusting
you with the heavy shit.

01:18:55.921 --> 01:18:57.259
Julia!

01:18:57.260 --> 01:18:59.307
Uhuh! Just in time!

01:18:59.308 --> 01:19:01.207
Bobby don't!

01:19:05.568 --> 01:19:06.853
No!

01:19:53.181 --> 01:19:56.515
Shit! Nice shot!

01:19:58.445 --> 01:20:01.113
I'm gonna get Julia. You
take care of the Staff.

01:20:01.114 --> 01:20:03.959
That gold is better
coming down.

01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:08.766
You frosty? I'll
say hot partner.

01:20:54.148 --> 01:20:55.452
What now Nick?

01:21:03.833 --> 01:21:06.379
You know it didn't have to be Julia.
But I just

01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:08.665
couldn't resist it
bringing a small circle.

01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:10.818
Come on we're screwed right?

01:21:24.079 --> 01:21:25.551
Get over here.

01:21:28.736 --> 01:21:30.430
How's it coming Roy?

01:21:30.431 --> 01:21:31.982
It's harder than it looks.

01:21:43.662 --> 01:21:46.602
Killing you never
gets old Nicky.

01:21:46.603 --> 01:21:48.953
Anytime now.

01:21:52.545 --> 01:21:54.495
Come on Roy!

01:21:54.496 --> 01:21:57.176
Do some cowboy stuff.

01:22:16.162 --> 01:22:19.127
Please! Roy!

01:22:26.063 --> 01:22:27.736
There he is.

01:22:32.974 --> 01:22:34.048
No.

01:22:51.184 --> 01:22:59.117
Well partner. I
have a new partner.

01:23:53.718 --> 01:23:55.585
I missed you.

01:23:55.586 --> 01:23:59.866
I missed you so much.

01:23:59.867 --> 01:24:07.367
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:24:07.368 --> 01:24:10.081
It's okay been
with me know that.

01:24:10.082 --> 01:24:13.798
That's all I wanted.

01:24:13.799 --> 01:24:16.045
But not like this.

01:24:16.046 --> 01:24:22.004
Julia, you got to
live your life.

01:24:22.058 --> 01:24:25.979
Without me.

01:24:25.980 --> 01:24:29.222
I hope you say goodbye.

01:24:29.223 --> 01:24:33.555
Can't stay here.

01:24:33.556 --> 01:24:37.473
It's okay.

01:24:39.748 --> 01:24:45.443
Go! I will always love you.

01:24:45.444 --> 01:24:46.444
Good bye.

01:25:08.764 --> 01:25:10.787
She's gonna be okay.

01:25:10.788 --> 01:25:12.126
Thank you.

01:25:12.127 --> 01:25:13.581
You owe me for that.

01:25:18.877 --> 01:25:21.320
Let's settle up. Sure.

01:25:21.321 --> 01:25:24.419
I would like to be allowed
to design my own medal.

01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.265
Not so fast.

01:25:25.266 --> 01:25:28.824
The Eternals wanna have you had your
disciplinary hearing without you.

01:25:28.825 --> 01:25:30.860
While we were saving the world?

01:25:30.861 --> 01:25:34.109
Nick, as a new recruit you've
been let off with a warning.

01:25:34.110 --> 01:25:35.213
Reasonably.

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:37.597
Roy, your punishment.
Punishment?

01:25:37.598 --> 01:25:41.162
Yes. 53 more years have
been added to your terms.

01:25:41.163 --> 01:25:43.221
53 years? That's...
That's a lot.

01:25:43.222 --> 01:25:45.759
This is honky tonk bullshit.

01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:48.688
You just like having me around.
Don't you?

01:25:58.378 --> 01:25:59.480
My hat.

01:26:02.413 --> 01:26:04.720
You found it?

01:26:08.228 --> 01:26:11.620
I guess, I could have
brought you flowers but...

01:26:19.513 --> 01:26:21.510
I like violence.

01:26:30.887 --> 01:26:32.483
She Billy goated me.

01:26:32.484 --> 01:26:36.072
Something we used to do.

01:26:37.856 --> 01:26:41.540
Ah! She covered up damn ankle
with the damn white boots.

01:26:43.602 --> 01:26:45.221
53 more years huh?

01:26:45.222 --> 01:26:48.781
Well, I still got
somethings to work on.

01:26:48.782 --> 01:26:51.557
Hell this is the third
time I've been extended.

01:26:51.558 --> 01:26:54.959
Oh . Got you something.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.779
What's this?

01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:59.819
I know you weren't happy
with grandpa Chin.

01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:03.191
Called a few strings.
Got you some new ID.

01:27:03.192 --> 01:27:09.267
Thank you. Thank you Roy.
I need that.

01:27:09.268 --> 01:27:10.947
This is great.

01:27:10.948 --> 01:27:13.648
Oh you got to be shitting me.

01:27:13.649 --> 01:27:17.172
Ah! Did what I could
inventory is what it is.

01:27:17.173 --> 01:27:19.834
You thought this was
an improvement?
