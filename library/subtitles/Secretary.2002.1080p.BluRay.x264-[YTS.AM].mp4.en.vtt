taken a walk by myself before.

I probably never had taken a walk alone.

the permission to do this,

It was a check for $680.

I felt like I was doing the right thing.

And I didn't tell anybody about any of it.

I pretended to go to work as usual,

01:28:39.481 --> 01:28:42.483
and watched his office
from across the street.

He hired a new girl
and changed the locks on the doors.

for me to do about it.

to grab and pinch my nipples

to pee on his patio,

01:29:25.444 --> 01:29:27.403

01:29:27.487 --> 01:29:29.071
I thought you were a masochist.

01:29:29.197 --> 01:29:32.241
Then there was the one
who liked being tied to a gas stove

01:29:32.409 --> 01:29:36.328
while the burners were on full blast,
and I had to throw tomatoes at him.

01:29:54.097 --> 01:29:57.600

because I didn't know what else to do.

than you in those days.

01:42:50.498 --> 01:42:53.208
I told him where the second one came from.

01:42:53.376 --> 01:42:55.252
I remembered them all.

01:42:56.337 --> 01:42:58.713
And for the first time in my life,

01:42:59.507 --> 01:43:01.800
I felt beautiful.

01:43:02.969 --> 01:43:05.011
Finally part of the earth.

01:43:06.347 --> 01:43:10.851
I touched the soil, and he loved me back.

01:43:32.456 --> 01:43:34.749
Where did you go to high school?

01:43:37.795 --> 01:43:39.838
What was your mother like?

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:43.758
What was her name?

01:43:47.972 --> 01:43:52.893
What did it say under
your senior yearbook picture?

01:43:57.565 --> 01:43:59.524
Who was your first love?

01:44:03.529 --> 01:44:08.283
When did your heart first get broken?

01:44:14.832 --> 01:44:16.750
Where were you born?

01:44:25.593 --> 01:44:27.218
Des Moines, Iowa.

01:44:47.907 --> 01:44:52.869
LEE: AII our activities melted
into an everyday sort of life

01:44:53.329 --> 01:44:56.539
until we looked like
any other couple you'd see.

01:44:57.333 --> 01:45:01.795
Turn that over, yes. Just pull it tight.

01:45:03.172 --> 01:45:06.257
Now, these pillows like to be stacked.

01:45:08.594 --> 01:45:10.345
Largest to smallest.

01:45:12.390 --> 01:45:14.224
We had a June wedding,

01:45:14.308 --> 01:45:17.018
by ourselves at the justice of the peace.

01:45:18.479 --> 01:45:21.064
Then, we honeymooned in the mountains.

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:25.610
We only had the weekend
because Edward had to get back to work.
