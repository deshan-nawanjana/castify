00:00:54.083 --> 00:00:55.821
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

2
00:00:55.822 --> 00:00:57.922
<i>there was a girl called Ella.</i>

3
00:01:00.392 --> 00:01:03.027
<i>And she saw the world not always as it was,</i>

4
00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.898
<i>but as perhaps it could be,
with just a little bit of magic.</i>

5
00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:12.904
Ah, my darling!

6
00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:15.907
<i>To her mother and father, she was a princess.</i>

7
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:19.777
<i>True, she had no title, nor crown, nor castle,</i>

8
00:01:19.779 --> 00:01:23.247
<i>but she was the ruler of her own little kingdom,</i>

9
00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:27.118
<i>whose borders were the house and
meadow on the forest's edge</i>

10
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.954
<i>where her people had lived for generations.</i>

11
00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:32.678
<i>With Mr. Goose...</i>

12
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.596
<i>and all their animal family.</i>

13
00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:41.432
Hello, there.
What do you think you're doing?

14
00:01:41.434 --> 00:01:43.468
Let the little ones have their share.

15
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.704
We don't want you getting an upset stomach.

16
00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.306
Oh, Gus-Gus,

17
00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:50.641
you're a house mouse, not a garden mouse.

18
00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.410
Isn't he, Jacqueline?

19
00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:55.079
And you mustn't eat Mr. Goose's food.

20
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:56.545
Isn't that right, Mummy?

21
00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:58.917
Do you still believe that they understand you?

22
00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.038
Don't they, Mother?
Oh, yes.

23
00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:04.755
I believe that animals listen and speak to us

24
00:02:04.757 --> 00:02:07.237
if we only have the ear for it.

25
00:02:08.261 --> 00:02:09.894
That's how we learn to look after them.

26
00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:11.629
Who looks after us?

27
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.931
Fairy godmothers, of course.

28
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:15.666
And do you believe in them?

29
00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:17.135
I believe in everything.

30
00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.470
Then I believe in everything, too.

31
00:02:22.342 --> 00:02:23.808
<i>Her father was a merchant</i>

32
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.510
<i>who went abroad</i>

33
00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:29.147
<i>and brought tribute back from
all of Ella's subject lands.</i>

34
00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:30.429
Ella!

35
00:02:31.316 --> 00:02:34.318
Where are my girls, my beautiful girls?

36
00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:37.755
Where are my darlings?

37
00:02:39.324 --> 00:02:41.792
<i>Ella missed him terribly when he was away.</i>

38
00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.262
<i>But she knew he would always return.</i>

39
00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.364
- There she is!
- Papa, welcome home!

40
00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.299
How are you?

41
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.500
You've grown!

42
00:02:49.502 --> 00:02:51.335
Haven't you, now?

43
00:02:53.005 --> 00:02:54.505
There you go, sir.
What was that?

44
00:02:55.307 --> 00:02:56.874
Oh, this?

45
00:02:56.876 --> 00:02:59.043
I found it hanging on a tree.

46
00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:02.780
I think there may be something inside.

47
00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.454
Oh, it's so pretty.

48
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.258
In French, that is <i> un papillon.</i>

49
00:03:22.734 --> 00:03:24.402
Ouch. Ouch.

50
00:03:25.404 --> 00:03:27.271
You're standing on my feet.

51
00:03:28.006 --> 00:03:29.040
Shall we?

52
00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:34.158
Look, Mummy!
I'm dancing!

53
00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:37.995
Whee!

54
00:03:46.825 --> 00:03:48.559
Little <i> papillon.</i>

55
00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:54.198
<i>All was just as it should be.</i>

56
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.602
<i>They knew themselves to be the most
happy of families to live as they did</i>

57
00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.503
<i>and to love each other so.</i>

58
00:04:23.295 --> 00:04:26.631
<i>But sorrow can come to any kingdom,</i>

59
00:04:26.633 --> 00:04:28.466
<i>no matter how happy.</i>

60
00:04:35.907 --> 00:04:38.042
<i>And so it came to Ella's home.</i>

61
00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:43.080
I'm so sorry.

62
00:04:43.082 --> 00:04:45.483
Thank you, Doctor.

63
00:04:45.485 --> 00:04:47.325
This must have been very difficult for you.

64
00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:52.323
Come.

65
00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:53.405
Ella.

66
00:05:08.907 --> 00:05:10.641
Ella, my darling.

67
00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:14.512
I want to tell you a secret.

68
00:05:14.514 --> 00:05:17.281
A great secret that will see you through

69
00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:18.916
all the trials that life can offer.

70
00:05:20.585 --> 00:05:22.545
You must always remember this.

71
00:05:24.256 --> 00:05:26.924
Have courage and be kind.

72
00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:31.629
You have more kindness in your little finger

73
00:05:31.631 --> 00:05:34.665
than most people possess in their whole body.

74
00:05:34.667 --> 00:05:38.936
And it has power, more than you know.

75
00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.773
- And magic.
- Magic?

76
00:05:45.877 --> 00:05:49.013
Have courage and be kind, my darling.

77
00:05:50.849 --> 00:05:51.949
Will you promise me?

78
00:05:52.351 --> 00:05:53.471
I promise.

79
00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:55.219
Good.

80
00:05:55.954 --> 00:05:57.054
Good.

81
00:05:57.056 --> 00:05:59.423
And...

82
00:06:01.727 --> 00:06:04.261
I must go very soon, my love.

83
00:06:06.031 --> 00:06:07.631
Please forgive me.

84
00:06:08.734 --> 00:06:11.094
Of course I forgive you.

85
00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:19.443
I love you.

86
00:06:21.913 --> 00:06:24.248
I love you, my darling.

87
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.383
I love you.

88
00:06:42.601 --> 00:06:46.771
<i>Time passed, and pain turned to memory.</i>

89
00:06:59.751 --> 00:07:03.554
<i>In her heart, Ella stayed the same.</i>

90
00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:06.857
<i>For she remembered her promise to her mother.</i>

91
00:07:06.859 --> 00:07:09.360
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

92
00:07:14.566 --> 00:07:17.301
<i>Father, however, was much changed.</i>

93
00:07:17.303 --> 00:07:19.343
<i>But he hoped for better times.</i>

94
00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:23.808
"And thence home,

95
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.711
"and my wife and I singing, to our great content,

96
00:07:27.713 --> 00:07:30.314
"and if ever there were a man happier in his fortunes,

97
00:07:30.316 --> 00:07:32.149
"I know him not."

98
00:07:33.285 --> 00:07:36.086
Thus ends Mr. Pepys for today.

99
00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:38.589
I do love a happy ending, don't you?

100
00:07:38.591 --> 00:07:41.031
They're quite my favorite sort.

101
00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:43.060
As well they should be.

102
00:07:43.662 --> 00:07:45.496
Ella...

103
00:07:45.498 --> 00:07:50.134
I have come to the conclusion
that it's time, perhaps...

104
00:07:51.236 --> 00:07:53.070
to begin a new chapter.

105
00:07:53.638 --> 00:07:55.606
Indeed, Father?

106
00:07:55.608 --> 00:07:57.842
You'll recall that some time ago, in my travels,

107
00:07:57.844 --> 00:07:59.910
I made the acquaintance of Sir Francis Tremaine.

108
00:07:59.912 --> 00:08:01.512
Yes.

109
00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:04.014
The Master of the Mercer's Guild, is he not?

110
00:08:04.016 --> 00:08:05.850
Was.

111
00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.251
The poor man has died, alas.

112
00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:09.587
His widow,

113
00:08:11.356 --> 00:08:13.357
an honorable woman,

114
00:08:13.359 --> 00:08:15.693
finds herself alone,

115
00:08:15.695 --> 00:08:18.135
though still in the prime of her life.

116
00:08:20.832 --> 00:08:22.600
You're worried about telling me.

117
00:08:23.301 --> 00:08:25.102
But you mustn't be.

118
00:08:26.271 --> 00:08:28.606
Not if it will lead to your happiness.

119
00:08:28.608 --> 00:08:29.707
Yes.

120
00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:31.775
Happiness.

121
00:08:33.512 --> 00:08:38.349
Do you think I may be allowed one last chance,

122
00:08:38.351 --> 00:08:40.591
even though I thought such
things were done with for good?

123
00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:43.721
Of course I do, Father.

124
00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:50.461
She'll merely be your stepmother.

125
00:08:50.463 --> 00:08:53.297
And you'll have two lovely
sisters to keep you company.

126
00:09:02.474 --> 00:09:04.608
Have courage, be kind.

127
00:09:14.319 --> 00:09:17.588
Welcome, ladies. Welcome!

128
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:19.089
She's skinny as a broomstick!

129
00:09:19.091 --> 00:09:20.624
And that stringy hair!

130
00:09:21.159 --> 00:09:22.760
You're very nice.

131
00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.595
Welcome.
I'm so happy to meet you.

132
00:09:24.597 --> 00:09:26.697
You have such pretty hair.

133
00:09:26.699 --> 00:09:28.399
Thank you.
You should have it styled.

134
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.434
Oh.
I'm sure you're right.

135
00:09:30.436 --> 00:09:31.869
Would you like a tour of the house?
What did she say?

136
00:09:31.871 --> 00:09:33.938
She wants to show us around her farmhouse.

137
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:36.380
She's proud of it, I think.
Do they keep animals inside?

138
00:09:40.545 --> 00:09:43.414
How charming.
How perfectly charming.

139
00:09:44.616 --> 00:09:45.683
Lucifer.

140
00:09:47.452 --> 00:09:49.086
<i>Her stepmother-to-be</i>

141
00:09:49.088 --> 00:09:52.289
<i>was a woman of keen feeling and refined taste.</i>

142
00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:55.893
<i>And she, too, had known grief.</i>

143
00:09:55.895 --> 00:09:58.262
<i>But she wore it wonderfully well.</i>

144
00:10:27.959 --> 00:10:31.428
You did not say your daughter was so beautiful.

145
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.663
Oh, she takes after her...

146
00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:35.733
Her mother.

147
00:10:37.669 --> 00:10:39.570
Just so.

148
00:10:39.572 --> 00:10:41.605
- What does Mummy mean?
- What's so charming about it?

149
00:10:41.607 --> 00:10:42.840
She's lying.
That's just good manners.

150
00:10:42.842 --> 00:10:44.174
Shut up.

151
00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.243
How long has your family lived here?

152
00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:48.012
Over 200 years.

153
00:10:48.014 --> 00:10:49.913
And in all that time, they never thought to decorate?

154
00:10:49.915 --> 00:10:52.683
Anastasia, hush.

155
00:10:53.685 --> 00:10:55.925
They'll think you are in earnest.

156
00:10:57.756 --> 00:10:59.156
<i>Ella's stepmother,</i>

157
00:10:59.158 --> 00:11:01.291
<i>high-spirited lady that she was,</i>

158
00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:04.795
<i>set out to restore life and laughter to the house.</i>

159
00:11:07.532 --> 00:11:09.533
Oh, you are awful, Baron.

160
00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.438
Ah, fortune favors me again.

161
00:11:22.213 --> 00:11:25.382
Well, look who's having a party of their own.

162
00:11:25.384 --> 00:11:29.553
Jacqueline, Teddy, Matilda, greedy Gus-Gus.

163
00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.455
Uh-oh.

164
00:11:33.224 --> 00:11:36.360
Just what...

165
00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:39.797
Yes, what do you think you're up to, Lucifer?

166
00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:43.359
Jacqueline is my guest, and the
eating of guests is not allowed.

167
00:11:45.070 --> 00:11:47.971
Go on, now.
You've plenty of cat food to keep you happy.

168
00:11:49.374 --> 00:11:51.574
We ladies must help one another.

169
00:11:56.181 --> 00:11:58.382
You're missing the party.

170
00:11:58.384 --> 00:12:00.944
Oh, I imagine it's much like all the other ones.

171
00:12:02.253 --> 00:12:03.921
And I'm leaving first thing, El.

172
00:12:03.923 --> 00:12:05.756
No. But you're...

173
00:12:05.758 --> 00:12:07.825
You're hardly back from the last trip.

174
00:12:09.428 --> 00:12:10.761
Do you have to go?

175
00:12:10.763 --> 00:12:12.930
It's just a few months, my darling.

176
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.102
What would you like me to bring you home from abroad?

177
00:12:18.104 --> 00:12:19.503
You know, your sisters...

178
00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.905
uh, stepsisters, have asked for

179
00:12:21.907 --> 00:12:24.341
parasols and lace.

180
00:12:25.276 --> 00:12:26.516
What will you have?

181
00:12:28.446 --> 00:12:32.015
Bring me the first branch your
shoulder brushes on your journey.

182
00:12:33.118 --> 00:12:35.753
That's a curious request.

183
00:12:35.755 --> 00:12:37.421
Well, you'll have to take it with you

184
00:12:37.423 --> 00:12:39.289
on your way...

185
00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:42.526
and think of me when you look at it.

186
00:12:42.528 --> 00:12:45.796
And when you bring it back,
it means that you'll be with it.

187
00:12:47.565 --> 00:12:49.533
And that's what I really want.

188
00:12:50.702 --> 00:12:53.070
For you to come back.

189
00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:54.072
No matter what.

190
00:12:58.043 --> 00:12:59.109
I will.

191
00:13:02.147 --> 00:13:05.783
Ella, while I'm away,

192
00:13:05.785 --> 00:13:08.051
I want you to be good to your stepmother

193
00:13:08.053 --> 00:13:10.213
and stepsisters, even though they may be...

194
00:13:10.488 --> 00:13:12.823
trying at times.

195
00:13:14.626 --> 00:13:16.660
I promise.
Thank you.

196
00:13:16.662 --> 00:13:18.896
I always leave a part of me behind, Ella.

197
00:13:20.298 --> 00:13:23.000
Remember that.

198
00:13:23.002 --> 00:13:27.070
And your mother's here, too, though you see her not.

199
00:13:28.506 --> 00:13:30.826
She's the very heart of this place.

200
00:13:31.676 --> 00:13:33.677
And that's why we must cherish this house,

201
00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:35.145
always, for her.

202
00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.017
I miss her.

203
00:13:41.786 --> 00:13:42.986
Do you?

204
00:13:44.956 --> 00:13:46.156
Very much.

205
00:14:01.039 --> 00:14:03.207
- Remember the lace!
- I simply must have it!

206
00:14:03.209 --> 00:14:04.641
And my parasol!

207
00:14:04.643 --> 00:14:06.844
For my complexion!

208
00:14:06.846 --> 00:14:09.346
That means skin, if you don't know!

209
00:14:12.317 --> 00:14:14.384
Bye!

210
00:14:14.386 --> 00:14:16.119
Bye, Ella!

211
00:14:16.121 --> 00:14:17.221
I love you!

212
00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:18.956
I love you, too!

213
00:14:22.193 --> 00:14:23.694
Bye!

214
00:14:45.483 --> 00:14:46.884
Ella, dear.

215
00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:58.355
Now, now.
Mustn't blub.

216
00:15:00.198 --> 00:15:01.398
Yes, Stepmother.

217
00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:03.800
Oh, you needn't call me that.

218
00:15:04.702 --> 00:15:06.770
"Madam" will do.

219
00:15:06.772 --> 00:15:08.405
There isn't room for me and all of your clothes!

220
00:15:08.407 --> 00:15:10.741
Well, then make yourself smaller!

221
00:15:10.743 --> 00:15:12.242
Anastasia and Drisella

222
00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:13.677
have always shared a room.

223
00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:15.846
Such dear, affectionate girls.

224
00:15:18.117 --> 00:15:19.783
Or...
Or better yet, disappear entirely!

225
00:15:19.785 --> 00:15:21.251
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

226
00:15:21.253 --> 00:15:23.921
Sometimes I could scratch your eyes out!

227
00:15:23.923 --> 00:15:27.323
I think they're finding
the sleeping quarters rather confining.

228
00:15:28.294 --> 00:15:31.962
Oh, well, my bedroom's the biggest
besides yours and Father's.

229
00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.864
Perhaps they'd like to share it.

230
00:15:34.465 --> 00:15:36.700
What a wonderful idea.

231
00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:38.702
What a good girl you are.

232
00:15:39.871 --> 00:15:41.071
I can stay in the...

233
00:15:41.073 --> 00:15:42.205
The attic.

234
00:15:42.974 --> 00:15:44.134
Quite so.

235
00:15:46.644 --> 00:15:47.878
The attic?

236
00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.780
Yes.

237
00:15:49.782 --> 00:15:53.917
Oh, only temporarily, while I have
all the other rooms redecorated.

238
00:15:53.919 --> 00:15:55.752
The attic's so nice and airy

239
00:15:55.754 --> 00:15:59.423
and you'll be away from all of our fuss and bother.

240
00:15:59.425 --> 00:16:04.561
You'd be even more cozy if you kept all
this bric-a-brac up there with you.

241
00:16:05.396 --> 00:16:07.030
Keep you amused.

242
00:16:43.368 --> 00:16:44.601
Well...

243
00:16:46.537 --> 00:16:48.739
no one shall disturb me here.

244
00:17:07.358 --> 00:17:08.792
Oh, hello, Gus-Gus.

245
00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:11.475
Oh...

246
00:17:14.332 --> 00:17:15.499
Oh.

247
00:17:17.002 --> 00:17:19.503
Go on, Gus-Gus, you can do it.

248
00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.087
So this is where you take refuge.

249
00:17:25.343 --> 00:17:26.743
Me too, it would seem.

250
00:17:28.212 --> 00:17:29.332
Right.

251
00:17:30.581 --> 00:17:31.581
Who's going to help me?

252
00:17:31.583 --> 00:17:32.749
Simpleton.

253
00:17:32.751 --> 00:17:34.351
That is the last straw.

254
00:17:34.353 --> 00:17:36.833
Our little sister, up there, talking to the woodworm.

255
00:17:38.523 --> 00:17:40.057
How very pleasant.

256
00:17:41.059 --> 00:17:42.339
No cats...

257
00:17:44.328 --> 00:17:46.163
and no stepsisters.

258
00:17:47.932 --> 00:17:49.266
We have a halfwit for a sister.

259
00:17:49.268 --> 00:17:50.500
I've got two.

260
00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:52.402
I heard that.

261
00:17:52.404 --> 00:17:54.764
Who is she talking to?
She's mad.

262
00:18:02.581 --> 00:18:03.947
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Miss Ella.

263
00:18:03.949 --> 00:18:05.449
Good morning, Tom!

264
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:13.957
Hello. Don't mind if I...

265
00:18:13.959 --> 00:18:16.159
What a lovely Chantecler.
Well done.

266
00:18:16.527 --> 00:18:17.527
Thanks.

267
00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:19.776
'Morning.
'Morning.

268
00:18:23.401 --> 00:18:24.568
Thank you, Miss Ella.

269
00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.702
You're welcome.

270
00:18:30.141 --> 00:18:32.709
Ella!

271
00:18:32.711 --> 00:18:35.445
Wake up, girls!
It's lunch time!

272
00:18:35.447 --> 00:18:36.947
<i>Mornings did not agree</i>

273
00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.381
<i>with Ella's stepsisters.</i>

274
00:18:43.654 --> 00:18:45.222
<i>And they lacked accomplishment</i>

275
00:18:45.224 --> 00:18:47.491
<i>in such domestic arts as keeping house.</i>

276
00:18:48.927 --> 00:18:51.287
<i>In fact, they lacked accomplishment in any art.</i>

277
00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:23.527
Oh.

278
00:20:02.133 --> 00:20:03.266
Do shut up.

279
00:20:05.903 --> 00:20:07.504
<i>Ella's great comfort</i>

280
00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:10.874
<i>were the letters that Father
would send from his travels.</i>

281
00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:13.310
<i>The weeks away lengthened to months,</i>

282
00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:16.413
<i>but every day would bring his
thoughts from some distant part.</i>

283
00:20:16.415 --> 00:20:18.248
Miss Ella, it's the mail coach!

284
00:20:18.250 --> 00:20:20.417
<i>Until late one afternoon...</i>

285
00:20:21.586 --> 00:20:23.153
Farmer John?

286
00:20:24.689 --> 00:20:26.056
Miss Ella.

287
00:20:26.058 --> 00:20:27.891
It's your father, miss.

288
00:20:29.026 --> 00:20:30.927
He took ill on the road.

289
00:20:33.164 --> 00:20:34.965
He's passed on, miss.

290
00:20:36.567 --> 00:20:37.901
He's gone.

291
00:20:40.071 --> 00:20:43.006
To the end, he spoke only of you, miss.

292
00:20:43.574 --> 00:20:44.574
And your mother.

293
00:20:46.577 --> 00:20:48.345
I was to give you this.

294
00:20:49.914 --> 00:20:51.915
But what about my lace?

295
00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:54.517
My parasol?

296
00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:56.953
Can't you see?
None of that matters.

297
00:20:58.856 --> 00:21:00.190
We're ruined.

298
00:21:02.126 --> 00:21:03.760
How will we live?

299
00:21:10.868 --> 00:21:12.202
Thank you.

300
00:21:15.273 --> 00:21:17.507
It must have been very difficult for you.

301
00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:08.358
<i>How indeed to live.</i>

302
00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:10.627
<i>Economies had to be taken.</i>

303
00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:13.530
<i>Ella's stepmother dismissed the household.</i>

304
00:22:30.848 --> 00:22:33.016
<i>Her stepmother and stepsisters</i>

305
00:22:33.018 --> 00:22:34.551
<i>ever misused her.</i>

306
00:22:36.053 --> 00:22:38.093
<i>And by and by they considered Ella</i>

307
00:22:38.723 --> 00:22:41.358
<i>less a sister than a servant.</i>

308
00:22:43.894 --> 00:22:46.429
<i>And so Ella was left to do all the work.</i>

309
00:22:49.066 --> 00:22:53.570
<i>This was a good thing, for it
distracted her from her grief.</i>

310
00:22:53.572 --> 00:22:55.572
<i>At least that was what her stepmother said.</i>

311
00:22:58.309 --> 00:23:01.678
<i>And she and her two daughters were more than happy</i>

312
00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.148
<i>to provide Ella with lots and lots of distraction.</i>

313
00:23:13.224 --> 00:23:17.894
<i>In their defense, they did share
with her the very food they ate,</i>

314
00:23:17.896 --> 00:23:20.497
<i>or rather, the scraps from their table.</i>

315
00:23:22.099 --> 00:23:23.700
<i>She had little in the way of friends.</i>

316
00:23:23.702 --> 00:23:26.102
<i>Well, her friends were very little.</i>

317
00:23:27.204 --> 00:23:29.706
There you are.

318
00:23:29.708 --> 00:23:31.548
Have dinner with me, won't you?

319
00:23:34.845 --> 00:23:37.847
<i>But those friends she had,
she treated with an open heart</i>

320
00:23:37.849 --> 00:23:39.349
<i>and an open hand.</i>

321
00:23:43.954 --> 00:23:45.188
Your table.

322
00:24:04.708 --> 00:24:07.644
<i>Sometimes, by the end of the day,</i>

323
00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:11.114
<i>the drafty attic was too cold to spend the night in,</i>

324
00:24:11.116 --> 00:24:13.983
<i>so she lay by the dying embers of the hearth</i>

325
00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:15.485
<i>to keep warm.</i>

326
00:24:33.237 --> 00:24:35.839
I thought breakfast was ready.

327
00:24:35.841 --> 00:24:37.240
It is, madam.

328
00:24:37.242 --> 00:24:39.676
I'm only mending the fire.

329
00:24:39.678 --> 00:24:43.246
In future, can we not be called
until the work is done?

330
00:24:43.248 --> 00:24:44.547
As you wish.

331
00:24:46.083 --> 00:24:48.243
Ella, what's that on your face?

332
00:24:50.020 --> 00:24:51.221
Madam?

333
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:54.824
It's ash from the fireplace.

334
00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:58.027
Do clean yourself up.

335
00:24:58.029 --> 00:24:59.696
You'll get cinders in our tea.

336
00:24:59.698 --> 00:25:03.199
I've got a new name for her!
Cinderwench.

337
00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:04.501
I couldn't bear to look so dirty.

338
00:25:04.503 --> 00:25:06.269
Oh, Dirty Ella.

339
00:25:06.271 --> 00:25:08.538
Cinder-ella!

340
00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:10.106
That's what we'll call you.

341
00:25:10.108 --> 00:25:11.140
Oh, girls,

342
00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:12.475
you're too clever.

343
00:25:14.879 --> 00:25:16.346
Who's this for?

344
00:25:18.349 --> 00:25:20.350
Is there someone we've forgotten?

345
00:25:21.118 --> 00:25:22.619
It's my place.

346
00:25:22.621 --> 00:25:25.321
It seems too much to expect you to prepare breakfast,

347
00:25:25.323 --> 00:25:28.157
serve it and still sit with us.

348
00:25:28.159 --> 00:25:31.027
Wouldn't you prefer to eat
when all the work is done, Ella?

349
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:33.129
Or should I say, "Cinderella"?

350
00:25:33.998 --> 00:25:34.998
Hmm?

351
00:26:19.610 --> 00:26:22.011
<i>Cinderella.</i>

352
00:26:22.013 --> 00:26:24.781
<i>Names have power, like magic spells.</i>

353
00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:28.384
<i>And of a sudden, it seemed to her</i>

354
00:26:28.386 --> 00:26:30.353
<i>that her stepmother and stepsisters</i>

355
00:26:30.355 --> 00:26:32.288
<i>had indeed transformed her</i>

356
00:26:32.290 --> 00:26:34.457
<i>into merely a creature of ash</i>

357
00:26:34.459 --> 00:26:35.658
<i>and toil.</i>

358
00:26:58.316 --> 00:27:00.316
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

359
00:27:14.498 --> 00:27:15.798
Run!

360
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.400
Quickly, my friend, or they'll catch you!

361
00:27:17.501 --> 00:27:19.369
Go!

362
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:22.839
Whoa! Easy!

363
00:27:25.610 --> 00:27:29.112
<i>Perhaps it was just as well that
Ella's stepsisters were cruel.</i>

364
00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:31.481
<i>For had she not run to the forest,</i>

365
00:27:31.483 --> 00:27:33.683
<i>she might never have met the prince.</i>

366
00:27:35.486 --> 00:27:38.421
- Easy! Easy!
- Whoa! Whoa!

367
00:27:38.423 --> 00:27:40.123
Easy, boy!

368
00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:41.324
Come on, boy, slow down!

369
00:27:43.127 --> 00:27:44.460
Miss!

370
00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:45.962
Miss! Are you all right?

371
00:27:45.964 --> 00:27:47.797
Hold on!

372
00:27:47.799 --> 00:27:49.332
I'm all right, thank you!

373
00:27:49.334 --> 00:27:50.433
That's fine.
Whoa!

374
00:27:50.435 --> 00:27:52.602
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

375
00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:53.770
Whoa.
Whoa.

376
00:27:57.708 --> 00:27:59.542
Are you all right?
I'm all right,

377
00:27:59.544 --> 00:28:01.624
but you've nearly frightened the life out of him.

378
00:28:02.046 --> 00:28:03.146
Who?

379
00:28:03.148 --> 00:28:04.781
The stag.

380
00:28:04.783 --> 00:28:06.049
What's he ever done to you

381
00:28:06.051 --> 00:28:07.950
that you should chase him about?

382
00:28:07.952 --> 00:28:11.621
I must confess I've never met him before.

383
00:28:11.623 --> 00:28:13.389
He is a friend of yours?

384
00:28:13.391 --> 00:28:15.058
An acquaintance.

385
00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:16.459
We met just now.

386
00:28:18.162 --> 00:28:19.195
I looked into his eyes,

387
00:28:19.197 --> 00:28:21.798
and he looked into mine,

388
00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:24.367
and I just felt he had a great
deal left to do with his life.

389
00:28:24.369 --> 00:28:25.668
That's all.

390
00:28:25.670 --> 00:28:27.804
Miss, what do they call you?

391
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:32.008
Never mind what they call me.

392
00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:34.577
You shouldn't be this deep in the forest alone.

393
00:28:34.579 --> 00:28:36.913
I'm not alone.
I'm with you, Mister...

394
00:28:37.881 --> 00:28:39.749
What do they call you?

395
00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:41.918
You don't know who I am?

396
00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:43.120
That is...

397
00:28:43.987 --> 00:28:45.321
They call me Kit.

398
00:28:45.323 --> 00:28:46.589
Well, my father does

399
00:28:46.591 --> 00:28:47.890
when he's in a good mood.

400
00:28:49.593 --> 00:28:50.593
And...

401
00:28:51.995 --> 00:28:53.062
where do you live, Mr. Kit?

402
00:28:53.064 --> 00:28:54.430
At the palace.

403
00:28:54.432 --> 00:28:56.933
My father's teaching me his trade.

404
00:28:56.935 --> 00:28:57.967
You're an apprentice?

405
00:28:58.435 --> 00:28:59.736
Of a sort.

406
00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:01.938
That's very fine.

407
00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.773
Do they treat you well?

408
00:29:03.775 --> 00:29:05.842
Better than I deserve, most likely.

409
00:29:06.443 --> 00:29:07.510
And you?

410
00:29:09.513 --> 00:29:11.647
They treat me as well as they're able.

411
00:29:12.916 --> 00:29:14.036
I'm sorry.

412
00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:16.686
It's not your doing.

413
00:29:18.055 --> 00:29:19.856
Nor yours either, I'll bet.

414
00:29:22.059 --> 00:29:23.793
It's not so very bad.

415
00:29:23.795 --> 00:29:25.928
Others have it worse, I'm sure.

416
00:29:26.396 --> 00:29:27.530
We must...

417
00:29:28.732 --> 00:29:31.968
simply have courage and be kind, mustn't we?

418
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:35.138
Yes.

419
00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.706
You're right.

420
00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:40.443
That's exactly how I feel.

421
00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:47.083
Please don't let them hurt him.

422
00:29:47.085 --> 00:29:50.553
But we're hunting, you see.
It's what's done.

423
00:29:50.555 --> 00:29:53.435
Just because it's what's done doesn't
mean it's what should be done.

424
00:29:53.824 --> 00:29:55.024
Right again.

425
00:29:56.393 --> 00:29:57.560
Then,

426
00:29:58.662 --> 00:30:00.696
you'll leave him alone, won't you?

427
00:30:03.467 --> 00:30:04.700
I will.

428
00:30:06.603 --> 00:30:09.005
Thank you very much, Mr. Kit.

429
00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.340
Ah.

430
00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:12.842
There you are, Your High...

431
00:30:12.844 --> 00:30:14.744
It's Kit! Kit!

432
00:30:14.746 --> 00:30:16.946
Kit! I'm Kit.
I'm on my way.

433
00:30:17.815 --> 00:30:20.082
Well, we'd better get a move on,

434
00:30:20.084 --> 00:30:21.584
Mr. Kit.

435
00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:23.653
As I said.

436
00:30:24.188 --> 00:30:25.454
On my way.

437
00:30:40.637 --> 00:30:43.077
I hope to see you again, miss.

438
00:30:44.374 --> 00:30:45.708
And I, you.

439
00:31:26.216 --> 00:31:28.818
You sound as if you're the first
fellow ever to meet a pretty girl.

440
00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.720
She wasn't a "pretty girl."

441
00:31:30.722 --> 00:31:32.355
Well, she was a pretty girl,

442
00:31:32.357 --> 00:31:33.756
but there was so much more to her.

443
00:31:33.758 --> 00:31:36.025
How much more?
You've only met her once.

444
00:31:36.027 --> 00:31:37.760
How could you know anything about her?

445
00:31:37.762 --> 00:31:39.896
You told me you knew right away when you met Mother.

446
00:31:39.898 --> 00:31:41.664
That's different.
Your mother was a princess.

447
00:31:41.666 --> 00:31:42.865
You would have loved her anyway.

448
00:31:42.867 --> 00:31:43.933
I would never have seen her,

449
00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:46.235
because it wouldn't have been appropriate.

450
00:31:46.237 --> 00:31:49.605
And my father would have told me what I'm telling you

451
00:31:49.607 --> 00:31:50.740
and I would have listened.

452
00:31:50.742 --> 00:31:51.874
No, you wouldn't.
Yes, I would.

453
00:31:51.876 --> 00:31:52.909
No, you wouldn't.
I would.

454
00:31:52.911 --> 00:31:54.751
You wouldn't.
You're right.

455
00:32:00.083 --> 00:32:01.584
Well, how is he?

456
00:32:03.287 --> 00:32:04.654
Your Majesty...

457
00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.425
Never mind.

458
00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:12.907
If it takes that long to work out
a way to say it, I already know.

459
00:32:15.766 --> 00:32:16.866
Father...

460
00:32:19.069 --> 00:32:20.770
Way of all flesh, boy.

461
00:32:22.906 --> 00:32:24.140
Come.

462
00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.302
We shall be late.

463
00:32:28.313 --> 00:32:30.713
And punctuality is the...

464
00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:32.782
...politeness of princes.

465
00:32:32.784 --> 00:32:34.750
His Majesty, the King!

466
00:32:34.752 --> 00:32:36.819
I'm sure your father spoke to you
of your behavior in the forest.

467
00:32:36.821 --> 00:32:38.554
Is it any business of yours, Grand Duke?

468
00:32:38.556 --> 00:32:41.490
Your business is my business, Your Royal Highness.

469
00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:43.559
It will not do to let the stag go free.

470
00:32:43.561 --> 00:32:46.429
Just because it's what's done doesn't
mean it's what should be done.

471
00:32:46.431 --> 00:32:47.964
Or something like that.

472
00:32:47.966 --> 00:32:49.799
Master Phineus, master of the paintbrush,

473
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.500
patiently awaits.

474
00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:53.235
Make him look marriageable, Master Phineus.

475
00:32:53.237 --> 00:32:55.438
We must attract a suitable bride,

476
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:58.174
even if he won't listen to a word I say.

477
00:32:58.176 --> 00:33:00.476
I shall endeavor to please, Your Majesty.

478
00:33:00.478 --> 00:33:02.645
But I can't work miracles.

479
00:33:02.647 --> 00:33:04.680
A splendid canvas, Master Phineus.

480
00:33:04.682 --> 00:33:05.948
Thank you.

481
00:33:05.950 --> 00:33:07.683
As if he knows anything about art.

482
00:33:07.685 --> 00:33:08.851
So, these portraits

483
00:33:08.853 --> 00:33:10.653
will really be sent abroad?

484
00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:14.256
To induce the high and mighty to
attend this ball you insist upon.

485
00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:16.325
Which is a tradition.
Which is beloved.

486
00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:18.861
At which you will choose a bride.

487
00:33:18.863 --> 00:33:20.429
Ah, fascinating.

488
00:33:20.431 --> 00:33:24.700
If I must marry, could I not wed,
say, a good, honest country girl?

489
00:33:24.702 --> 00:33:28.337
How many divisions will this
"good, honest country girl" provide us?

490
00:33:28.339 --> 00:33:30.673
How will she make the kingdom stronger?

491
00:33:30.675 --> 00:33:34.377
We are a small kingdom amongst
great states, Your Royal Highness.

492
00:33:34.379 --> 00:33:35.619
And it's a dangerous world.

493
00:33:37.481 --> 00:33:38.981
Listen, boy.

494
00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:41.317
Taking you up, Master Phineus.
Good.

495
00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:44.220
I want to see you and the kingdom safe.

496
00:33:45.555 --> 00:33:47.123
All right, Father,

497
00:33:48.392 --> 00:33:49.792
on one condition.

498
00:33:51.561 --> 00:33:55.297
Let the invitations go to everyone,
not just the nobility.

499
00:33:55.299 --> 00:33:57.500
The wars have brought sorrow on us all.

500
00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:58.801
What do you think?

501
00:33:58.803 --> 00:34:00.636
Would that please the people?

502
00:34:00.638 --> 00:34:03.005
It's beyond my wit, Your Majesty.

503
00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:05.741
But I wouldn't mind a bit of a jolly.

504
00:34:07.411 --> 00:34:09.771
I think we might have made a bargain.

505
00:34:10.347 --> 00:34:12.648
A ball for the people,

506
00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.683
and a princess for the prince.

507
00:34:14.685 --> 00:34:17.253
Sounds like a step in the right
direction, if you ask...

508
00:34:17.255 --> 00:34:19.555
We didn't ask you.

509
00:34:19.557 --> 00:34:22.158
I'm so sorry.
Naughty paint, naughty brush.

510
00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:23.320
Down, please, Samson.

511
00:34:23.927 --> 00:34:25.928
Haven't even got a cushion.

512
00:34:25.930 --> 00:34:27.530
Right, down, down.
Not that... Oi!

513
00:34:27.532 --> 00:34:29.398
I'm on the ground.

514
00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.436
I am literally on the ground.
Sorry.

515
00:34:33.438 --> 00:34:35.571
Actually this is a very good angle for you.

516
00:34:35.573 --> 00:34:37.693
Great nostrils.
Could I have a longer brush?

517
00:34:51.122 --> 00:34:53.456
You don't look well, miss.

518
00:34:53.458 --> 00:34:54.690
Not at all.

519
00:34:55.959 --> 00:34:58.094
Why do you stay there, when they treat you so?

520
00:34:59.463 --> 00:35:02.198
Because I made my mother and father a promise

521
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.567
to cherish the place we were so happy.

522
00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:06.268
They loved our house...

523
00:35:07.971 --> 00:35:10.806
and now that they're gone, I love it for them.

524
00:35:10.808 --> 00:35:12.308
It's my home.

525
00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:16.112
Hear ye! Hear ye!

526
00:35:16.114 --> 00:35:17.646
Quiet!

527
00:35:17.648 --> 00:35:19.148
"Know,

528
00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:22.151
"on this day, two weeks hence,

529
00:35:22.153 --> 00:35:24.820
"there shall be held, at the palace,

530
00:35:24.822 --> 00:35:27.123
"a Royal Ball.

531
00:35:27.125 --> 00:35:30.659
"At said ball,

532
00:35:30.661 --> 00:35:33.996
"in accordance with ancient custom,

533
00:35:33.998 --> 00:35:37.466
"the prince shall choose a bride.

534
00:35:38.468 --> 00:35:39.835
"Furthermore,

535
00:35:39.837 --> 00:35:42.304
"at the behest of the prince,

536
00:35:42.306 --> 00:35:46.575
"it is hereby declared that
every maiden in the kingdom,

537
00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:49.078
"be she noble or commoner...

538
00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:52.848
"is invited to attend.

539
00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:59.388
"Such is the command of our most noble king."

540
00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:03.359
Excuse me, madam.

541
00:36:03.361 --> 00:36:05.661
<i>Ella was enormously excited</i>

542
00:36:05.663 --> 00:36:07.396
<i>to see Kit, the apprentice.</i>

543
00:36:08.865 --> 00:36:11.200
<i>And her stepsisters were mildly intrigued</i>

544
00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:13.162
<i>by the notion of meeting the prince.</i>

545
00:36:14.639 --> 00:36:17.106
I shall trick him into loving me.
See if I don't!

546
00:36:17.108 --> 00:36:19.708
This is the most hugest news!

547
00:36:19.710 --> 00:36:21.277
Calm yourselves.

548
00:36:21.945 --> 00:36:23.612
Now listen to me.

549
00:36:23.614 --> 00:36:26.148
One of you must win the heart of the prince.

550
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.350
Do that, and we can unwind
the debt in which we were ensnared

551
00:36:28.352 --> 00:36:30.052
when we came to this backwater!

552
00:36:30.054 --> 00:36:32.121
I, a princess?

553
00:36:32.123 --> 00:36:33.222
Or rather, I,

554
00:36:33.224 --> 00:36:35.124
a princess?

555
00:36:36.526 --> 00:36:37.860
Having delivered your news,

556
00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.995
why are you still here?

557
00:36:39.997 --> 00:36:41.964
You must return to town right away

558
00:36:41.966 --> 00:36:44.526
and tell that seamstress to run
us up three fine ball gowns.

559
00:36:45.302 --> 00:36:46.302
Three?

560
00:36:47.637 --> 00:36:49.597
That's very thoughtful of you.

561
00:36:49.739 --> 00:36:51.307
What do you mean?

562
00:36:51.309 --> 00:36:52.808
To think of me.

563
00:36:52.810 --> 00:36:54.476
Think of you?

564
00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:56.745
Mummy, she believes the other dress is for her.

565
00:36:56.747 --> 00:36:58.080
Poor, slow, little Cinders.

566
00:36:58.082 --> 00:37:00.049
How embarrassing.

567
00:37:00.051 --> 00:37:01.917
You're too ambitious for your own good.

568
00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:04.253
Oh, no.
I only want to see my friend.

569
00:37:05.088 --> 00:37:06.822
Let me be very clear.

570
00:37:07.591 --> 00:37:09.858
One gown for Anastasia,

571
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:11.427
one for Drisella,

572
00:37:11.429 --> 00:37:13.596
and one for me!

573
00:37:15.499 --> 00:37:18.059
She doesn't know what that means.

574
00:37:24.108 --> 00:37:25.574
Good.
Right.

575
00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:26.609
That's settled then.

576
00:37:26.611 --> 00:37:28.344
Now go!

577
00:37:28.346 --> 00:37:30.946
Every girl in the kingdom will be chasing the prince.

578
00:37:30.948 --> 00:37:34.250
You must get there first before the
seamstress is drowning in work!

579
00:37:34.252 --> 00:37:35.784
Tell me what she said, Drisella.

580
00:37:35.786 --> 00:37:37.353
I speak French, not Italian!

581
00:37:55.739 --> 00:37:57.306
Wake up, Your Royal Highness.
You're in a daze.

582
00:37:57.308 --> 00:37:58.607
I'm sorry.

583
00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:00.209
You've been off since the hunt.

584
00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:02.978
It's that wonderful girl.
I can't stop thinking about her.

585
00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.546
But there are plenty of girls.

586
00:38:04.548 --> 00:38:07.316
But her spirit, her goodness...

587
00:38:07.318 --> 00:38:08.484
You don't suppose she has a sister, do you?

588
00:38:08.486 --> 00:38:10.085
I don't know.

589
00:38:10.087 --> 00:38:11.820
I don't know anything about her.

590
00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:16.158
Perhaps your mystery girl may come to the ball.

591
00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:17.993
That is why you threw the doors open, is it not?

592
00:38:17.995 --> 00:38:19.295
Captain.

593
00:38:19.297 --> 00:38:20.462
It was for the benefit of the people.

594
00:38:20.464 --> 00:38:21.597
Of course.

595
00:38:21.599 --> 00:38:22.831
How shallow of me.

596
00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:24.500
And if she comes, then what?

597
00:38:24.502 --> 00:38:26.602
Then you will tell her you're a prince.

598
00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:28.804
And a prince may take whichever bride he wishes.

599
00:38:28.806 --> 00:38:29.806
Ha!
Ha?

600
00:38:29.807 --> 00:38:31.173
Yes, "ha."

601
00:38:31.175 --> 00:38:32.574
You know my father and the Grand Duke

602
00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.743
will only have me marry a princess.

603
00:38:34.745 --> 00:38:37.946
Well, if this girl from the
forest is as charming as you say,

604
00:38:37.948 --> 00:38:40.308
they may change their minds.

605
00:38:43.186 --> 00:38:45.087
<i>The day of the ball arrived</i>

606
00:38:45.089 --> 00:38:47.022
<i>and the entire kingdom</i>

607
00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:49.858
<i>held its breath in anticipation.</i>

608
00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:51.460
<i>You want me to be your queen?</i>

609
00:38:51.462 --> 00:38:53.962
Who? Me?

610
00:38:53.964 --> 00:38:55.164
Tighter.

611
00:38:56.334 --> 00:38:57.334
Tighter!

612
00:38:58.268 --> 00:38:59.308
Tighter.

613
00:39:00.136 --> 00:39:01.537
That's it!

614
00:39:01.539 --> 00:39:02.971
A vision, sister.

615
00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.707
Likewise.

616
00:39:04.709 --> 00:39:06.642
We must compete for the prince's hand.

617
00:39:06.644 --> 00:39:09.211
But let it not mean we harbor
dark thoughts against each other.

618
00:39:09.213 --> 00:39:11.780
Of course not, dear sister.

619
00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:15.284
I wouldn't dream of poisoning you
before we leave for the ball.

620
00:39:15.286 --> 00:39:18.153
Oh, nor I of pushing you from a
moving carriage on the way there.

621
00:39:18.155 --> 00:39:22.224
Or I of dashing your brains out
on the palace steps as we arrive.

622
00:39:22.226 --> 00:39:24.226
We are sisters, after all.

623
00:39:24.228 --> 00:39:27.062
And blood is so much thicker than water.

624
00:39:27.064 --> 00:39:29.064
We shall let the prince decide.

625
00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:30.699
What will he be like, I wonder?

626
00:39:32.403 --> 00:39:34.470
What does it matter what he's like?

627
00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:37.740
He's rich beyond reason.

628
00:39:37.742 --> 00:39:40.676
Wouldn't you like to know a bit
about him before you marry him?

629
00:39:40.678 --> 00:39:43.245
Certainly not.
It might change my mind.

630
00:39:43.247 --> 00:39:45.914
I bet you have never ever spoken to a man.

631
00:39:45.916 --> 00:39:47.583
Have you, moon-face?

632
00:39:48.084 --> 00:39:50.219
I have, once.

633
00:39:50.221 --> 00:39:51.920
To a gentleman.

634
00:39:51.922 --> 00:39:53.922
Some menial, no doubt.

635
00:39:53.924 --> 00:39:55.424
Some 'prentice.

636
00:39:55.426 --> 00:39:57.059
He was an apprentice, yes.

637
00:39:57.061 --> 00:39:59.328
All men are fools, that's what Mama says.

638
00:39:59.330 --> 00:40:01.163
The sooner you learn that, the better.

639
00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.899
The first dance, milady?

640
00:40:03.901 --> 00:40:06.034
Prince Charming, you're so naughty!

641
00:40:13.176 --> 00:40:14.843
I want to try it.
No, I'm wearing it.

642
00:40:14.845 --> 00:40:15.911
No! No!

643
00:40:19.717 --> 00:40:21.283
<i>Not for the first time,</i>

644
00:40:21.285 --> 00:40:25.020
<i>Ella actually felt pity for these two schemers,</i>

645
00:40:25.022 --> 00:40:29.091
<i>who could be every bit as ugly
within as they were fair without.</i>

646
00:40:29.793 --> 00:40:30.926
My prince!

647
00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:34.196
But I will be his queen!

648
00:40:37.267 --> 00:40:38.700
<i>If her stepmother would not have</i>

649
00:40:38.702 --> 00:40:40.436
<i>a fourth dress made,</i>

650
00:40:40.438 --> 00:40:43.305
<i>it seemed to Ella that there was no reason why</i>

651
00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.541
<i>she would not try to run it up herself.</i>

652
00:40:47.977 --> 00:40:50.813
<i>And besides, she did have a little help.</i>

653
00:41:09.599 --> 00:41:12.668
My dear girls.

654
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:16.271
To see you like this...

655
00:41:16.273 --> 00:41:20.442
it makes me believe one of you
might just snare the prince.

656
00:41:20.444 --> 00:41:25.013
And to think I have two horses in the race!

657
00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:28.851
I daresay no one in the kingdom
will outshine my daughters.

658
00:41:32.355 --> 00:41:33.789
Cinderella?

659
00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:36.158
It cost you nothing.

660
00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.360
It was my mother's old dress, you see.

661
00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:39.795
And I took it up myself.

662
00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:40.996
Ooh-la.

663
00:41:40.998 --> 00:41:42.531
Cinderella at the ball!

664
00:41:42.533 --> 00:41:44.700
No one wants a servant for a bride.

665
00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:46.268
After all I've done...

666
00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:47.669
I don't want to ruin anything.

667
00:41:47.671 --> 00:41:49.438
I don't even want to meet the prince.

668
00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:52.441
Oh, and you won't, because there's
no question of your going.

669
00:41:52.443 --> 00:41:55.711
But, all of the maidens of the land are invited,

670
00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:57.212
by order of the king.

671
00:41:57.214 --> 00:42:00.449
It is the king I am thinking of.

672
00:42:00.451 --> 00:42:02.851
It would be an insult to the royal personage

673
00:42:02.853 --> 00:42:05.654
to take you to the palace dressed in these old rags.

674
00:42:05.656 --> 00:42:06.788
Rags?

675
00:42:07.724 --> 00:42:08.891
This was my mother's.

676
00:42:10.059 --> 00:42:13.896
Oh, I'm...
sorry to have to tell you...

677
00:42:13.898 --> 00:42:16.632
but your mother's taste was questionable.

678
00:42:16.634 --> 00:42:20.402
This thing is so old-fashioned

679
00:42:20.404 --> 00:42:22.738
it's practically falling to pieces.

680
00:42:24.074 --> 00:42:25.407
The shoulder's frayed.

681
00:42:25.409 --> 00:42:28.210
- It's falling to bits.
- And this!

682
00:42:28.212 --> 00:42:30.012
It's a ridiculous, old-fashioned joke!

683
00:42:32.982 --> 00:42:34.816
How could you?

684
00:42:34.818 --> 00:42:36.685
How could I otherwise?

685
00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:40.556
I will not have anyone associate
my daughters with you.

686
00:42:40.558 --> 00:42:41.857
It would ruin their prospects

687
00:42:41.859 --> 00:42:44.726
to be seen arriving with a ragged servant girl.

688
00:42:44.728 --> 00:42:47.729
Because that is what you are.

689
00:42:47.731 --> 00:42:49.932
And that is what you will always be.

690
00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:52.167
Now mark my words!

691
00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.770
You shall not go to the ball!

692
00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:56.471
Go on, get going!

693
00:43:25.969 --> 00:43:27.536
I'm sorry, Mother.

694
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:31.720
I'm sorry.

695
00:43:33.376 --> 00:43:35.811
I said I'd have courage, but I don't.

696
00:43:35.813 --> 00:43:37.279
Not anymore.

697
00:43:38.881 --> 00:43:40.382
I don't believe anymore.

698
00:43:59.168 --> 00:44:00.268
Excuse me.

699
00:44:01.839 --> 00:44:03.972
Can you help me, miss?

700
00:44:03.974 --> 00:44:07.576
Just a little crust of bread,
or better, a cup of milk?

701
00:44:08.111 --> 00:44:09.344
Yes.

702
00:44:10.146 --> 00:44:11.847
Yes, yes, yes.

703
00:44:11.849 --> 00:44:14.249
I think I can find something for you.

704
00:44:22.191 --> 00:44:23.358
Why are you crying?

705
00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:24.760
Oh, it's nothing.

706
00:44:28.865 --> 00:44:30.465
Nothing?

707
00:44:30.467 --> 00:44:31.700
Nothing.

708
00:44:31.702 --> 00:44:33.935
What is a bowl of milk?
Nothing.

709
00:44:35.538 --> 00:44:37.618
But kindness makes it everything.

710
00:44:49.053 --> 00:44:52.454
Now, I don't mean to hurry you, but
you really haven't got long, Ella.

711
00:44:53.056 --> 00:44:54.623
How do you know me?

712
00:44:55.725 --> 00:44:56.792
Who are you?

713
00:44:56.794 --> 00:44:58.527
Who am I?

714
00:44:58.529 --> 00:45:00.489
I should think you'd have worked that one out.

715
00:45:02.331 --> 00:45:04.166
I'm your hairy dogfather.

716
00:45:04.168 --> 00:45:05.767
I mean, fairy godmother!

717
00:45:07.403 --> 00:45:08.637
You can't be.

718
00:45:09.205 --> 00:45:10.505
Why not?

719
00:45:10.507 --> 00:45:13.241
They don't exist.

720
00:45:13.243 --> 00:45:15.577
They're just made up for children.

721
00:45:15.579 --> 00:45:17.913
Didn't your own mother believe in them?

722
00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:19.555
Don't say no, because I heard her.

723
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:21.316
You heard her?

724
00:45:21.318 --> 00:45:23.151
Oh, fiddle-faddle, fiddle-faddle.

725
00:45:23.153 --> 00:45:25.113
Right!
First things first.

726
00:45:26.255 --> 00:45:28.423
Let me slip into something more comfortable.

727
00:45:43.372 --> 00:45:44.906
Mmm.

728
00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:47.063
That's better.

729
00:45:48.444 --> 00:45:50.679
Now, where was I?

730
00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:51.947
How did you...

731
00:45:51.949 --> 00:45:54.216
Oh, yes. Let's see.

732
00:45:54.218 --> 00:45:57.686
What we need is something
that sort of says, "coach."

733
00:45:58.755 --> 00:45:59.755
Um...

734
00:46:00.389 --> 00:46:01.423
Oh, that trough?

735
00:46:02.125 --> 00:46:03.425
Doesn't really say "coach."

736
00:46:04.627 --> 00:46:07.129
No, no, I'm liking fruit and veg.

737
00:46:07.131 --> 00:46:08.430
Do you grow watermelons?

738
00:46:08.432 --> 00:46:09.598
No.

739
00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:10.799
Cantaloupe?

740
00:46:10.801 --> 00:46:11.967
I don't even know what that is.

741
00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:13.135
Artichoke?

742
00:46:13.137 --> 00:46:14.469
Kumquat?

743
00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:15.671
Beef tomato?

744
00:46:16.305 --> 00:46:18.373
We do have pumpkins.

745
00:46:18.375 --> 00:46:19.441
Ah.

746
00:46:21.544 --> 00:46:22.577
Pumpkins?

747
00:46:22.579 --> 00:46:24.079
This will be a first for me.

748
00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:25.081
Always interesting.

749
00:46:26.482 --> 00:46:27.883
I don't usually work with squashes.

750
00:46:27.885 --> 00:46:29.005
Too mushy.

751
00:46:32.054 --> 00:46:33.321
Let me see.
Oh, that'll do.

752
00:46:33.323 --> 00:46:34.843
Yes.
Knife?

753
00:46:36.092 --> 00:46:39.494
There you are.
Thank you, darling.

754
00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:41.563
Hello, my strangely orange vegetable friend.

755
00:46:41.565 --> 00:46:42.805
A quick snip for you.

756
00:46:43.399 --> 00:46:44.633
Ah, lovely!

757
00:46:44.635 --> 00:46:46.168
Ooh, heavy pumpkin!

758
00:46:46.170 --> 00:46:47.469
Look out, mices!

759
00:46:50.773 --> 00:46:51.673
Oh, well. Never mind.

760
00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:52.941
Let's do it here.

761
00:46:52.943 --> 00:46:54.342
Do what here?

762
00:46:54.344 --> 00:46:55.944
Turn the pumpkin into a carriage.

763
00:46:58.181 --> 00:46:59.314
You're making me nervous, actually.

764
00:46:59.316 --> 00:47:01.676
Shall I shut my eyes?
It might be better.

765
00:47:03.653 --> 00:47:06.173
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Let's just go for it.

766
00:47:07.957 --> 00:47:09.658
Ah.

767
00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.293
Well, something's definitely happening.

768
00:47:11.295 --> 00:47:13.461
You see, the trick is...

769
00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:16.423
Actually, I've forgotten what the trick is.
Hmm.

770
00:47:17.867 --> 00:47:19.634
I just thought, if it...

771
00:47:19.636 --> 00:47:21.203
If it does get much bigger...

772
00:47:21.205 --> 00:47:22.205
Yes?

773
00:47:23.272 --> 00:47:24.552
Hang on.

774
00:47:28.712 --> 00:47:30.312
Is that what you meant to do?

775
00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:32.180
Do you think that's what I meant to do?

776
00:47:32.182 --> 00:47:34.616
Run! Run, darling!

777
00:47:40.623 --> 00:47:41.623
Take cover!

778
00:48:01.344 --> 00:48:03.945
There!
One carriage.

779
00:48:04.747 --> 00:48:07.549
You really are my fairy godmother.

780
00:48:07.551 --> 00:48:09.384
Of course.

781
00:48:09.386 --> 00:48:11.546
I don't go about transforming
pumpkins for just anybody.

782
00:48:12.088 --> 00:48:14.189
Now, where are those mice?

783
00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:16.024
Mice?
Yes.

784
00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.425
Mice, mice, mice.

785
00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:18.560
There they are.

786
00:48:18.562 --> 00:48:20.262
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

787
00:48:31.774 --> 00:48:33.675
Four white chargers.

788
00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:35.710
Gus-Gus, how fine you look!

789
00:48:35.712 --> 00:48:37.545
But how did you...

790
00:48:37.547 --> 00:48:39.247
Now, where are we?

791
00:48:39.249 --> 00:48:42.517
Got carriage, horses...
Uh, footmen!

792
00:48:43.286 --> 00:48:44.406
Footmen?

793
00:48:45.788 --> 00:48:47.289
Hello, lovely Mr. Lizard.

794
00:48:47.291 --> 00:48:48.690
Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

795
00:48:52.361 --> 00:48:54.095
Hello!

796
00:48:59.235 --> 00:49:00.602
You called?

797
00:49:03.539 --> 00:49:05.040
Now, I need that coachman.

798
00:49:05.042 --> 00:49:06.474
Coachman?

799
00:49:06.476 --> 00:49:08.757
Did I say "coachman"?
I meant "goose."

800
00:49:15.451 --> 00:49:17.611
I can't drive.
I'm a goose.

801
00:49:19.221 --> 00:49:21.323
Now, shoo!

802
00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.725
Everyone into place, no time to be lost!

803
00:49:24.293 --> 00:49:25.727
Come on!

804
00:49:28.264 --> 00:49:29.464
Fairy Godmother!

805
00:49:30.066 --> 00:49:31.066
Yes, what?

806
00:49:32.001 --> 00:49:33.668
My dress.

807
00:49:33.670 --> 00:49:35.603
I can't go in this dress.

808
00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:37.172
Can you mend it?
Mend it?

809
00:49:37.174 --> 00:49:38.673
No, no.
I'll turn it into something new.

810
00:49:38.675 --> 00:49:40.742
Oh, no, please don't.

811
00:49:40.744 --> 00:49:42.577
This was my mother's.

812
00:49:44.113 --> 00:49:46.473
And I'd like to wear it when I go to the palace.

813
00:49:48.150 --> 00:49:50.685
It's almost like taking her with me.

814
00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:51.920
I understand.

815
00:49:54.323 --> 00:49:57.359
But she wouldn't mind if I gee it up a bit?

816
00:49:57.361 --> 00:49:58.994
Wouldn't mind a nice blue?

817
00:49:58.996 --> 00:50:00.095
No.

818
00:50:42.071 --> 00:50:43.471
There.

819
00:50:43.473 --> 00:50:45.573
It's beautiful.

820
00:50:45.575 --> 00:50:46.941
She'd love it.

821
00:50:48.411 --> 00:50:50.412
Now, come on.
Off you go. Quick!

822
00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:51.713
You'll be late!

823
00:50:53.682 --> 00:50:56.217
I'm very new at this!

824
00:50:56.219 --> 00:50:57.252
Oh, boy.

825
00:50:58.921 --> 00:51:00.922
Stop that blooming coach!

826
00:51:00.924 --> 00:51:01.990
Whoa!

827
00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:08.830
Thank you.

828
00:51:09.565 --> 00:51:10.565
Just a moment!

829
00:51:12.569 --> 00:51:14.769
Are those the best you have?

830
00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:16.504
It's all right.
No one will see them.

831
00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:18.606
No, they'll ruin the whole look.
Quick, quick.

832
00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:20.708
Take them off.
Really quite hideous.

833
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:22.777
Let's have something new for a change.

834
00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:23.859
I'm rather good at shoes.

835
00:51:34.223 --> 00:51:35.423
But...

836
00:51:36.459 --> 00:51:38.593
They're made of glass?

837
00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:40.428
Yes.

838
00:51:40.430 --> 00:51:42.797
And you'll find they're really comfortable.

839
00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:44.299
Ella, you really must go now.

840
00:51:45.468 --> 00:51:46.468
Oh, Fairy Godmother?

841
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.969
What is it?

842
00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.304
My stepmother and the girls?

843
00:51:49.306 --> 00:51:50.805
Don't worry.

844
00:51:50.807 --> 00:51:53.141
I'll make sure they don't recognize you.

845
00:51:54.376 --> 00:51:55.944
Now, off you go.

846
00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.946
For you shall go to the ball.

847
00:52:01.150 --> 00:52:03.718
- Ah, in you get.
- Oh, so lovely.

848
00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.886
Oh, do stop wittering on.

849
00:52:09.325 --> 00:52:10.725
Ella!

850
00:52:10.727 --> 00:52:12.160
I almost forgot.

851
00:52:12.162 --> 00:52:15.497
Remember, the magic will only last so long.

852
00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:17.966
With the last echo of the last bell,

853
00:52:17.968 --> 00:52:19.734
at the last stroke of midnight,

854
00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:22.003
the spell will be broken

855
00:52:22.005 --> 00:52:24.286
and all will return to what it was before.

856
00:52:24.673 --> 00:52:25.840
Midnight?

857
00:52:25.842 --> 00:52:27.442
Midnight.

858
00:52:27.444 --> 00:52:29.204
That's more than enough time.

859
00:52:30.179 --> 00:52:31.679
Off you go then.
Thank you.

860
00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:32.814
Thank you.

861
00:52:33.782 --> 00:52:35.917
Goosey, go!

862
00:52:38.687 --> 00:52:39.754
Goodbye!

863
00:53:34.677 --> 00:53:36.878
Chandeliers, aloft!

864
00:53:50.359 --> 00:53:52.560
Princess Mei Mei of Fujian.

865
00:53:55.598 --> 00:53:58.566
Princess Shahrzad of the Seljuqs.

866
00:53:59.869 --> 00:54:00.869
Your Highness!

867
00:54:02.271 --> 00:54:05.006
Princess Chelina of Zaragosa!

868
00:54:05.874 --> 00:54:09.177
Princess Imani of Shona!

869
00:54:12.748 --> 00:54:16.184
Princess Hiina of the Chrysanthemum Throne!

870
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:23.191
Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

871
00:54:26.629 --> 00:54:29.931
The Lady Tremaine and her daughters.

872
00:54:29.933 --> 00:54:30.965
I'm Drisella.

873
00:54:30.967 --> 00:54:32.400
And I'm Anastasia.

874
00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:33.534
People will want to know.
I'm the clever one.

875
00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.370
I'm very beautiful.

876
00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:38.906
The very clever Miss Drisella,

877
00:54:38.908 --> 00:54:41.876
and the very beautiful Anastasia.

878
00:54:42.478 --> 00:54:44.178
Do come on!

879
00:54:49.752 --> 00:54:51.219
The Lord Veneering.

880
00:54:52.655 --> 00:54:54.322
Who are you looking for?

881
00:54:55.824 --> 00:54:57.025
No one.

882
00:54:58.294 --> 00:55:01.062
It's that girl in the forest, isn't it?

883
00:55:01.064 --> 00:55:03.665
That's why you were so generous with the invitations.

884
00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:05.400
Father, it was for the people.

885
00:55:05.402 --> 00:55:07.962
I know you love the people, Kit.

886
00:55:09.004 --> 00:55:12.573
But I also know that your head's been turned.

887
00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:16.344
But you've only met her once, in the forest.

888
00:55:16.346 --> 00:55:18.913
And you would have me marry
someone I met once, tonight.

889
00:55:18.915 --> 00:55:20.682
A princess.

890
00:55:20.684 --> 00:55:23.017
It's a princess or nothing.

891
00:55:29.191 --> 00:55:30.711
- Hold the doors!
- One more coming in.

892
00:55:42.371 --> 00:55:44.706
May I present Her Royal Highness,

893
00:55:44.708 --> 00:55:47.442
the Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

894
00:55:52.648 --> 00:55:55.316
You are as handsome as your picture.

895
00:55:55.318 --> 00:55:59.454
And your little kingdom is enchanting.

896
00:55:59.456 --> 00:56:03.024
I hope the princess will not find
our "little kingdom" too confining.

897
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:10.031
Miss Ella.

898
00:56:10.632 --> 00:56:12.066
Thank you.

899
00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:26.600
I'm frightened, Mr. Lizard.

900
00:56:28.917 --> 00:56:32.420
I'm only a girl, not a princess.

901
00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:35.156
And I'm only a lizard, not a footman.

902
00:56:36.725 --> 00:56:38.226
Enjoy it while it lasts.

903
00:57:02.718 --> 00:57:06.254
Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness,

904
00:57:06.256 --> 00:57:09.090
My Lords, ladies and gentlemen,

905
00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:13.795
distinguished visitors and people of our land,

906
00:57:13.797 --> 00:57:18.366
the prince shall now choose his
partner for the first dance.

907
00:57:18.368 --> 00:57:21.903
Let our ball commence!

908
00:57:53.135 --> 00:57:56.270
Excuse me.

909
00:57:56.272 --> 00:57:58.406
A thousand apologies, Your Royal Highness.

910
00:57:58.408 --> 00:58:00.888
I don't know what happened.

911
00:59:04.873 --> 00:59:06.274
Mr. Kit.

912
00:59:08.810 --> 00:59:10.244
It's you,

913
00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:12.660
isn't it?

914
00:59:13.081 --> 00:59:14.882
Just so.

915
00:59:17.019 --> 00:59:18.653
Your Highness...

916
00:59:21.056 --> 00:59:22.323
If I may...

917
00:59:22.325 --> 00:59:23.624
that is...

918
00:59:26.395 --> 00:59:29.597
it would give me the greatest pleasure,

919
00:59:29.599 --> 00:59:32.767
if you would do me the honor of
letting me lead you through this...

920
00:59:32.769 --> 00:59:33.969
the first...

921
00:59:37.739 --> 00:59:38.940
Dance?

922
00:59:39.608 --> 00:59:40.942
Yes, dance.

923
00:59:40.944 --> 00:59:42.777
That's it.

924
01:00:05.367 --> 01:00:07.468
They're all looking at you.

925
01:00:07.470 --> 01:00:11.439
Believe me, they're all looking at you.

926
01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:22.677
Who is she?

927
01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:23.919
I have no idea.

928
01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:28.909
Who's that, Mama?

929
01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:31.378
I'm not exactly sure, but this does not bode well.

930
01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:32.780
That's a lovely dress she's got on.

931
01:02:32.782 --> 01:02:34.782
And how pretty she is.
Concentrate!

932
01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:37.284
You must turn the prince's head, you fools!
Now, get out there!

933
01:02:37.286 --> 01:02:38.953
But no one's asked us to dance.

934
01:02:38.955 --> 01:02:40.121
- Gentlemen.
- Oh!

935
01:02:40.123 --> 01:02:41.422
May I present my daughters,

936
01:02:41.424 --> 01:02:43.424
- Anastasia, Drisella.
<i>- Mademoiselle.</i>

937
01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:45.392
Off you go!

938
01:02:57.906 --> 01:02:59.373
Smile.

939
01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:08.415
Come with me.

940
01:03:08.417 --> 01:03:10.117
- Over there.
- Smile.

941
01:03:15.323 --> 01:03:16.891
So, you're the prince!

942
01:03:18.627 --> 01:03:21.595
Not "the prince," exactly.

943
01:03:21.597 --> 01:03:22.730
There are plenty of princes in the world.

944
01:03:22.732 --> 01:03:23.932
I'm only a prince.

945
01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.168
But your name's not really Kit.

946
01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:29.336
Certainly it is, and my father still calls me that,

947
01:03:29.338 --> 01:03:31.772
when he's especially un-peeved at me.

948
01:03:31.774 --> 01:03:34.408
But you're no apprentice.

949
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:35.843
I am.
An apprentice monarch.

950
01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.125
Still learning my trade.

951
01:03:38.313 --> 01:03:39.847
Oh, gosh!

952
01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:41.849
Look, please forgive me.

953
01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.784
I thought you might treat me differently if you knew.

954
01:03:43.786 --> 01:03:46.253
I mistook you for a good, honest country girl,

955
01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:49.456
and now I see you didn't want
to overawe a plain soldier.

956
01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.125
Little chance of that.

957
01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:52.593
No more surprises?

958
01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.163
No more surprises.

959
01:03:58.333 --> 01:04:00.301
Is that you?

960
01:04:00.303 --> 01:04:01.869
I hate myself in paintings.
Don't you?

961
01:04:03.105 --> 01:04:04.872
No one's ever painted my portrait.

962
01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:07.208
No?
Well, they should.

963
01:04:10.679 --> 01:04:11.979
Who is she?

964
01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:13.180
She gave no name, Your Grace.

965
01:04:13.182 --> 01:04:14.481
You didn't ask?

966
01:04:14.483 --> 01:04:18.719
On account of introducing Princess
Blodwyn of Llanfairpwllgwyngyll...

967
01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:20.801
Shut up, will you?
"Shut up." Absolutely.

968
01:04:24.893 --> 01:04:26.760
I don't believe this!

969
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:30.231
No! Not her!

970
01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:37.037
Won't they miss you at the ball?

971
01:04:38.306 --> 01:04:40.241
Maybe.

972
01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:42.083
But let's not go back just yet.

973
01:04:45.647 --> 01:04:46.981
What's wrong?

974
01:04:49.017 --> 01:04:53.420
When I go back, they will try to pair
me off with a lady of their choosing.

975
01:04:53.422 --> 01:04:55.756
I'm expected to marry for advantage.

976
01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:57.725
Oh.
Well, whose advantage?

977
01:04:57.727 --> 01:04:59.493
That is a good question.

978
01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:04.765
Well, surely you have a right to your own heart.

979
01:05:04.767 --> 01:05:07.201
And I must weigh that against the king's wishes.

980
01:05:07.203 --> 01:05:10.838
He's a wise ruler and a loving father.

981
01:05:11.706 --> 01:05:14.541
Well, perhaps he'll change his mind.

982
01:05:19.614 --> 01:05:21.782
I fear he hasn't much time to do so.

983
01:05:23.451 --> 01:05:25.019
Poor Kit.

984
01:05:27.455 --> 01:05:30.057
People are saying she's a princess.

985
01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:32.459
Our prince seems quite taken with her.

986
01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:34.728
She went straight for him.

987
01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.964
You have to appreciate her efficiency.

988
01:05:36.966 --> 01:05:40.534
But surely, if she is a princess, this may be good.

989
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:46.106
I've already promised him in marriage,
to the Princess Chelina.

990
01:05:47.108 --> 01:05:48.388
But...

991
01:05:49.544 --> 01:05:50.778
Oh.

992
01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.646
Forgive me, Your Grace.

993
01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:55.816
I did not mean to intrude.

994
01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.852
No, it's you who have to forgive me, madam.

995
01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:01.689
Your secret is safe with me.

996
01:06:14.903 --> 01:06:17.303
I've never shown this place to anyone.

997
01:06:23.111 --> 01:06:24.812
A secret garden.

998
01:06:28.350 --> 01:06:29.750
I love it!

999
01:06:37.359 --> 01:06:38.359
Please.

1000
01:06:39.194 --> 01:06:40.661
No, I shouldn't.

1001
01:06:40.663 --> 01:06:41.996
You should.

1002
01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:43.263
I shouldn't.
You should.

1003
01:06:43.265 --> 01:06:44.365
I shouldn't.
You should.

1004
01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:45.599
I will.

1005
01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:56.510
May I?

1006
01:06:56.512 --> 01:06:57.745
Please.

1007
01:07:13.061 --> 01:07:14.294
Oh!

1008
01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.640
It's made of glass.

1009
01:07:27.409 --> 01:07:28.809
And why not?

1010
01:07:29.377 --> 01:07:30.577
Allow me.

1011
01:07:30.579 --> 01:07:32.279
Thank you.

1012
01:07:43.925 --> 01:07:44.925
There.

1013
01:07:45.527 --> 01:07:46.660
There.

1014
01:07:51.666 --> 01:07:54.735
Won't you tell me who you really are?

1015
01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:58.072
If I do, I think everything might be different.

1016
01:07:58.074 --> 01:08:01.154
I don't understand.
Can you at least tell me your name?

1017
01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:03.243
My name is...

1018
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:10.517
I have to leave.

1019
01:08:10.519 --> 01:08:12.753
It's hard to explain.

1020
01:08:12.755 --> 01:08:15.756
Lizards and pumpkins, and things.

1021
01:08:18.626 --> 01:08:19.860
Wait!

1022
01:08:21.863 --> 01:08:23.564
Where are you going?

1023
01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.899
You've been awfully nice.

1024
01:08:25.901 --> 01:08:27.701
Thank you for a wonderful evening.
I've loved it.

1025
01:08:27.703 --> 01:08:28.943
Every second!

1026
01:08:37.979 --> 01:08:40.447
"Lizards and pumpkins."

1027
01:09:00.168 --> 01:09:01.635
Excuse me.

1028
01:09:01.637 --> 01:09:03.403
Sorry! Terribly sorry.

1029
01:09:03.938 --> 01:09:05.038
My goodness!

1030
01:09:07.642 --> 01:09:09.143
My prince!

1031
01:09:10.678 --> 01:09:11.979
You've got the wrong one!

1032
01:09:11.981 --> 01:09:13.347
You've got the wrong one!

1033
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:15.616
He needs her name!

1034
01:09:15.618 --> 01:09:16.850
I know he needs her name.

1035
01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:18.585
Her name, you ninny.
Get her name!

1036
01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:20.187
Ooh, that really hurt!

1037
01:09:21.022 --> 01:09:22.422
Oh, Your Majesty.

1038
01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:23.624
Young lady.

1039
01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:24.858
I am so sorry.

1040
01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:26.426
Oh, think nothing of it, my dear.

1041
01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:31.031
I wanted to say, Your Majesty,

1042
01:09:31.033 --> 01:09:33.467
your son Kit is the most lovely person I ever met.

1043
01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:35.869
So good and brave.

1044
01:09:35.871 --> 01:09:37.938
I hope you know how much he loves you.

1045
01:09:38.940 --> 01:09:40.374
Excuse me!

1046
01:09:53.154 --> 01:09:54.254
Mmm.

1047
01:09:59.727 --> 01:10:01.128
Wait!

1048
01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:08.001
Wait!

1049
01:10:08.003 --> 01:10:09.570
Where are you going?

1050
01:10:09.572 --> 01:10:10.572
Hurry, hurry!

1051
01:10:10.638 --> 01:10:11.805
Eh? Ah!

1052
01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.575
Come back!

1053
01:10:16.878 --> 01:10:17.878
Hurry!

1054
01:10:21.482 --> 01:10:22.722
Hurry, please, Mr. Goose!

1055
01:10:24.419 --> 01:10:25.552
Wait!

1056
01:10:29.490 --> 01:10:31.325
Watch out!

1057
01:10:37.198 --> 01:10:38.532
Captain, my horse.

1058
01:10:38.534 --> 01:10:40.033
No!

1059
01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:42.736
This may be some intrigue to lure you from the palace.

1060
01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:45.058
Your father needs you here.

1061
01:10:45.607 --> 01:10:47.107
Captain!

1062
01:10:47.109 --> 01:10:48.709
I was having a fine old time.

1063
01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.844
You had to go and choose that one, didn't you?

1064
01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:54.248
Yes, I did.

1065
01:11:20.475 --> 01:11:21.808
Hurry, Mr. Goose!

1066
01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:23.043
Come on!

1067
01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.047
Hee-ya!

1068
01:11:27.049 --> 01:11:28.482
Be careful, Mr. Goose!

1069
01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:29.650
Oh!

1070
01:11:32.987 --> 01:11:34.054
Oh, my goodness!

1071
01:11:43.665 --> 01:11:45.666
You there!
Stop in the name of the king!

1072
01:11:47.502 --> 01:11:48.902
Such bad timing.

1073
01:11:53.174 --> 01:11:54.241
Halt there!

1074
01:11:54.243 --> 01:11:55.243
I know what to do!

1075
01:11:55.677 --> 01:11:56.743
Yes!

1076
01:11:56.745 --> 01:11:57.978
Oh, yes!

1077
01:11:59.347 --> 01:12:00.347
Get this thing open!

1078
01:12:05.586 --> 01:12:06.753
Oh, dear!

1079
01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:07.755
Ah!

1080
01:12:17.532 --> 01:12:18.532
No, no, no.

1081
01:13:32.573 --> 01:13:33.853
Oh, I'm sorry.

1082
01:13:35.109 --> 01:13:37.549
You'll find it's very comfortable.

1083
01:13:45.052 --> 01:13:46.119
Oh...

1084
01:14:03.137 --> 01:14:04.704
Do shut up!

1085
01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:08.708
Cinderella!

1086
01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:11.278
Cinderella!
We'll have to wake her up.

1087
01:14:12.413 --> 01:14:13.947
Cinderella!

1088
01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:15.982
Wake up, lazy bones!

1089
01:14:15.984 --> 01:14:17.984
Tea and a plate of biscuits.

1090
01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:19.486
Welcome back!

1091
01:14:19.488 --> 01:14:21.788
- You look cheerful!
- And wet!

1092
01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:23.924
Oh, uh, I took a walk in the rain to cheer myself up.

1093
01:14:23.926 --> 01:14:24.991
Typical.

1094
01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.760
Tea.

1095
01:14:26.762 --> 01:14:28.829
We did not communicate through mere words.

1096
01:14:28.831 --> 01:14:30.330
Our souls met.

1097
01:14:30.332 --> 01:14:33.099
Precisely.
My soul and the prince's soul.

1098
01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:34.468
Your soul was over by the banquet tables.

1099
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:36.136
You didn't see him dance with me.

1100
01:14:36.138 --> 01:14:37.337
Dance with you?

1101
01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:39.840
He didn't even speak to you.

1102
01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.175
It was not our fault, Mother.
It was that girl.

1103
01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:43.844
The mystery princess.

1104
01:14:43.846 --> 01:14:45.312
Mystery princess?

1105
01:14:45.947 --> 01:14:47.948
My, what a charming notion.

1106
01:14:47.950 --> 01:14:49.683
Oh, she was no princess.

1107
01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.918
She was a preening interloper who
made a spectacle of herself.

1108
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.086
Oh?

1109
01:14:54.355 --> 01:14:56.356
A vulgar, young hussy marched into the ball,

1110
01:14:56.358 --> 01:14:58.925
unaccompanied, if you will,

1111
01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:01.461
and to the horror of everyone,
threw herself at the prince.

1112
01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:03.430
And he actually danced with the ugly thing.

1113
01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:04.698
- Yes?
- Yes.

1114
01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:09.202
He was too polite to send her packing
in front of everyone, you see.

1115
01:15:09.204 --> 01:15:12.939
But not wanting to expose us to the
presumptuous wench any further,

1116
01:15:12.941 --> 01:15:14.474
- he took her apart.
- And told her off.

1117
01:15:14.476 --> 01:15:16.209
But she refused to leave

1118
01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:19.679
and the palace guards chased her from the party!

1119
01:15:19.681 --> 01:15:21.882
I pity the prince.
Such bad taste.

1120
01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:23.450
They belong with each other.

1121
01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:25.051
Well, it's no matter, girls.

1122
01:15:25.053 --> 01:15:27.687
The ball was a mere diversion.

1123
01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:29.609
The prince is not free to marry for love.

1124
01:15:30.358 --> 01:15:33.293
He's promised to the Princess Chelina of Zaragosa.

1125
01:15:34.228 --> 01:15:36.296
The Grand Duke told me himself.

1126
01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.131
It's so very unfair.

1127
01:15:38.566 --> 01:15:40.667
Yes.

1128
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.769
The way of the world.

1129
01:15:46.841 --> 01:15:48.708
Oh, hello again.

1130
01:16:00.922 --> 01:16:02.455
Thank you for your help.

1131
01:16:03.257 --> 01:16:04.925
It really was like a dream.

1132
01:16:05.693 --> 01:16:07.494
Better than a dream.

1133
01:16:24.178 --> 01:16:25.879
<i>Ella couldn't wait to write down</i>

1134
01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:28.114
<i>all that had happened,</i>

1135
01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:31.851
<i>so that she might remember every single bit of it</i>

1136
01:16:31.853 --> 01:16:34.454
<i>just as if she were telling her mother and father</i>

1137
01:16:34.456 --> 01:16:38.325
<i>about the palace ball and her time with the prince.</i>

1138
01:16:42.964 --> 01:16:45.498
<i>Above all, the prince.</i>

1139
01:17:09.123 --> 01:17:10.557
Oh, you've come.

1140
01:17:11.325 --> 01:17:12.392
Good.

1141
01:17:14.295 --> 01:17:15.695
Oh, Father.

1142
01:17:16.764 --> 01:17:17.964
Don't go.

1143
01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.567
I must.

1144
01:17:21.802 --> 01:17:23.670
You needn't be alone.

1145
01:17:24.472 --> 01:17:26.806
Take a bride.

1146
01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.742
The Princess Chelina.

1147
01:17:29.677 --> 01:17:32.545
What if I commanded you to do so?

1148
01:17:34.515 --> 01:17:37.550
I love and respect you, but I will not.

1149
01:17:40.254 --> 01:17:44.290
I believe that we need not look outside of our borders

1150
01:17:44.292 --> 01:17:46.326
for strength or guidance.

1151
01:17:47.161 --> 01:17:50.296
What we need is right before us.

1152
01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:55.335
And we need only have courage and be kind to see it.

1153
01:17:58.706 --> 01:17:59.906
Just so.

1154
01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:04.911
You've become your own man.

1155
01:18:05.379 --> 01:18:06.613
Good.

1156
01:18:09.316 --> 01:18:12.452
And perhaps, in the little time left to me,

1157
01:18:12.454 --> 01:18:14.888
I can become the father you deserve.

1158
01:18:18.893 --> 01:18:21.594
You must not marry for advantage.

1159
01:18:24.398 --> 01:18:26.466
You must marry for love.

1160
01:18:30.738 --> 01:18:32.539
Find that girl.

1161
01:18:33.140 --> 01:18:35.075
Find her.

1162
01:18:35.077 --> 01:18:37.544
The one they're all talking about.

1163
01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:38.978
The forgetful one

1164
01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:41.420
who loses her shoes.
...loses her shoes.

1165
01:18:47.254 --> 01:18:49.489
Oh, be cheerful, boy.

1166
01:18:52.159 --> 01:18:54.094
Thank you, Father.

1167
01:18:54.829 --> 01:18:56.663
Thank you, Kit.

1168
01:19:01.602 --> 01:19:03.503
I love you, son.

1169
01:19:05.272 --> 01:19:06.940
I love you, Father.

1170
01:19:40.808 --> 01:19:43.443
<i>Once the time for mourning had passed,</i>

1171
01:19:43.445 --> 01:19:45.979
<i>a proclamation was sent out.</i>

1172
01:19:45.981 --> 01:19:49.649
Hear ye! Hear ye!

1173
01:19:49.651 --> 01:19:52.485
Hear ye!

1174
01:19:57.491 --> 01:19:59.993
Know that our new king

1175
01:19:59.995 --> 01:20:03.396
hereby declares his love for...

1176
01:20:05.733 --> 01:20:08.401
the mysterious princess...

1177
01:20:09.003 --> 01:20:10.503
as wore...

1178
01:20:10.505 --> 01:20:14.174
glass slippers to the ball.

1179
01:20:14.176 --> 01:20:19.345
And requests that she present herself at the palace,

1180
01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:23.149
whereupon, if she be willing,

1181
01:20:24.151 --> 01:20:29.155
he will forthwith marry her...

1182
01:20:30.192 --> 01:20:33.693
...with all due ceremony.

1183
01:21:10.364 --> 01:21:11.798
Are you looking for this?

1184
01:21:13.234 --> 01:21:16.002
There must be quite a story to go with it.

1185
01:21:16.004 --> 01:21:17.204
Won't you tell me?

1186
01:21:17.738 --> 01:21:18.805
No?

1187
01:21:19.573 --> 01:21:21.307
All right then.

1188
01:21:21.309 --> 01:21:23.543
I shall tell you a story.

1189
01:21:24.645 --> 01:21:26.679
Once upon a time,

1190
01:21:26.681 --> 01:21:29.582
there was a beautiful young girl

1191
01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:32.085
who married for love.

1192
01:21:32.087 --> 01:21:35.154
And she had two loving daughters.

1193
01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:37.223
All was well...

1194
01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:40.994
but, one day, her husband,

1195
01:21:40.996 --> 01:21:43.563
the light of her life, died.

1196
01:21:44.331 --> 01:21:46.165
The next time,

1197
01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:49.335
she married for the sake of her daughters.

1198
01:21:49.337 --> 01:21:53.506
But that man, too, was taken from her.

1199
01:21:53.508 --> 01:21:58.278
And she was doomed to look every
day upon his beloved child.

1200
01:22:00.781 --> 01:22:02.282
She had hoped to marry off

1201
01:22:02.284 --> 01:22:07.086
one of her beautiful, stupid daughters to the prince.

1202
01:22:07.088 --> 01:22:10.590
But his head was turned by a girl with glass slippers.

1203
01:22:11.258 --> 01:22:12.959
And so...

1204
01:22:12.961 --> 01:22:16.696
I lived unhappily ever after.

1205
01:22:18.966 --> 01:22:21.668
My story would appear to be ended.

1206
01:22:22.403 --> 01:22:25.038
Now, tell me yours.

1207
01:22:25.873 --> 01:22:27.140
Did you steal it?

1208
01:22:28.275 --> 01:22:29.275
No.

1209
01:22:29.977 --> 01:22:31.277
It was given to me.

1210
01:22:31.279 --> 01:22:32.478
Given to you?

1211
01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.647
Given to you.
Nothing is ever given.

1212
01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:36.482
For everything, we must pay and pay.

1213
01:22:36.484 --> 01:22:37.817
That's not true.

1214
01:22:38.986 --> 01:22:42.221
Kindness is free.
Love is free.

1215
01:22:42.223 --> 01:22:44.958
Love is not free.

1216
01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.761
Now, here is how you will pay me,

1217
01:22:48.763 --> 01:22:52.565
if you are to have what you desire.

1218
01:22:52.567 --> 01:22:56.936
No one will believe you, a dirty
servant girl without a family,

1219
01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:59.505
if you lay claim to the prince's heart.

1220
01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:01.975
But with a respectable gentlewoman to put you forward,

1221
01:23:01.977 --> 01:23:03.309
you will not be ignored.

1222
01:23:04.278 --> 01:23:05.578
When you are married,

1223
01:23:05.580 --> 01:23:09.449
you will make me the head of the royal household.

1224
01:23:09.451 --> 01:23:12.518
Anastasia and Drisella we will
pair off with wealthy lords.

1225
01:23:12.520 --> 01:23:15.321
And I shall manage that boy.

1226
01:23:15.956 --> 01:23:17.757
But he's not a boy.

1227
01:23:18.659 --> 01:23:20.626
And who are you?

1228
01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:22.829
How would you rule a kingdom?

1229
01:23:22.831 --> 01:23:25.031
Best to leave it to me.

1230
01:23:25.033 --> 01:23:27.200
That way we all get what we want.

1231
01:23:28.535 --> 01:23:29.669
No.

1232
01:23:33.674 --> 01:23:35.008
No?

1233
01:23:36.210 --> 01:23:38.277
I was not able to protect my father from you,

1234
01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:40.346
but I will protect the prince and the kingdom...

1235
01:23:41.548 --> 01:23:43.483
no matter what becomes of me.

1236
01:23:43.485 --> 01:23:46.686
Well, that is a mistake.

1237
01:23:47.955 --> 01:23:49.288
No!

1238
01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.356
Why?

1239
01:23:52.026 --> 01:23:54.227
Why are you so cruel?

1240
01:23:55.362 --> 01:23:57.063
I don't understand it.

1241
01:23:57.065 --> 01:23:59.365
I've tried to be kind to you.

1242
01:23:59.367 --> 01:24:00.700
You? Kind to me?

1243
01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:02.301
Yes.

1244
01:24:02.303 --> 01:24:04.570
And though no one deserves to be treated

1245
01:24:04.572 --> 01:24:06.105
as you have treated me.

1246
01:24:06.974 --> 01:24:08.307
Why do you do it?

1247
01:24:10.077 --> 01:24:11.244
Why?

1248
01:24:11.246 --> 01:24:13.312
Why?

1249
01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:18.217
Because you are young, and innocent, and good.

1250
01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:19.719
And I...

1251
01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:25.691
No!

1252
01:24:25.693 --> 01:24:26.826
No!

1253
01:24:32.366 --> 01:24:34.367
May I ask where you got this?

1254
01:24:34.369 --> 01:24:36.669
From a ragged servant girl in my household.

1255
01:24:38.105 --> 01:24:40.840
The mystery princess is a commoner.

1256
01:24:42.409 --> 01:24:46.012
You could imagine when I discovered
her subterfuge how horrified I was.

1257
01:24:47.114 --> 01:24:48.781
You told no one else?

1258
01:24:48.783 --> 01:24:52.118
Not even my own daughters.

1259
01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.254
No one need ever know the truth.

1260
01:24:55.256 --> 01:24:59.525
You've spared the kingdom
a great deal of embarrassment.

1261
01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:02.628
And I should like to keep it that way.

1262
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:04.097
Are you threatening me?

1263
01:25:04.631 --> 01:25:05.865
Yes.

1264
01:25:12.973 --> 01:25:14.273
So what do you want?

1265
01:25:15.309 --> 01:25:18.444
I should like to be a countess.

1266
01:25:18.446 --> 01:25:21.981
And I require advantageous
marriages for my two daughters.

1267
01:25:23.383 --> 01:25:24.383
Done.

1268
01:25:27.321 --> 01:25:28.488
And the girl?

1269
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:29.789
Oh.

1270
01:25:29.791 --> 01:25:31.911
Do with her what you will.

1271
01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.240
She's nothing to me.

1272
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:38.664
Where?
Abandoned on the side of the road.

1273
01:25:38.666 --> 01:25:39.899
And have you found her?
The girl?

1274
01:25:39.901 --> 01:25:41.901
No, she's disappeared.

1275
01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:44.170
There must be some reason she vanished.

1276
01:25:44.172 --> 01:25:45.838
Perhaps she has been prevented from speaking.

1277
01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:47.006
Do not lose heart, Kit.

1278
01:25:47.008 --> 01:25:50.309
On the contrary, lose heart and gain wisdom.

1279
01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:53.446
The people need to know that the kingdom is secure.

1280
01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:57.116
That the king has a queen,
and the land may have an heir.

1281
01:25:57.118 --> 01:25:58.851
They want to face the future with certainty!

1282
01:25:58.853 --> 01:26:00.820
Agreed!
Then let us be certain.

1283
01:26:00.822 --> 01:26:02.688
I am king.

1284
01:26:02.690 --> 01:26:05.358
I say we shall seek out the mystery princess,

1285
01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:07.093
even if she does not want to be found.

1286
01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.928
I have to see her again.

1287
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:11.364
But if she's not found...

1288
01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:14.934
then for the good of the kingdom, you
must marry the Princess Chelina.

1289
01:26:16.036 --> 01:26:17.316
For the good of the kingdom.

1290
01:26:29.550 --> 01:26:31.350
Very well, agreed.

1291
01:26:31.352 --> 01:26:32.518
But Your Highness...

1292
01:26:38.292 --> 01:26:40.193
But you will spare no effort.

1293
01:26:40.195 --> 01:26:41.894
Your Majesty, of course.

1294
01:26:41.896 --> 01:26:43.136
You have my word.

1295
01:27:03.517 --> 01:27:04.517
Next.

1296
01:27:10.190 --> 01:27:12.910
<i>The slipper traveled the length
and breadth of the kingdom,</i>

1297
01:27:14.394 --> 01:27:16.329
<i>visiting every maiden both high and low,</i>

1298
01:27:16.331 --> 01:27:18.397
<i>and every sort in between.</i>

1299
01:27:18.865 --> 01:27:20.333
Oh, Lord!

1300
01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:21.500
You first, madam.

1301
01:27:21.502 --> 01:27:24.203
Well, I'll give it a go.

1302
01:27:24.205 --> 01:27:26.486
Right. I say.
Where do you want me?

1303
01:27:26.773 --> 01:27:28.040
Oh!

1304
01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:30.376
Up! Up I go.

1305
01:27:30.378 --> 01:27:32.178
Oh, careful, my foot's a bit swollen.

1306
01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:33.180
I've been...

1307
01:27:35.849 --> 01:27:38.584
It's the yeast.

1308
01:27:38.586 --> 01:27:41.087
<i>The Grand Duke was true to his word.</i>

1309
01:27:41.089 --> 01:27:44.590
<i>He spared no effort to demonstrate to the prince</i>

1310
01:27:44.592 --> 01:27:47.627
<i>that the mystery princess was not to be found.</i>

1311
01:27:47.629 --> 01:27:48.928
It fits!

1312
01:27:48.930 --> 01:27:50.963
It doesn't fit you.
It does fit!

1313
01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:52.198
- It doesn't fit.
- It's mine!

1314
01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.433
I am the mystery princess!
Give back the shoe.

1315
01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:55.635
Take the shoe away from her!

1316
01:27:55.637 --> 01:27:56.802
Don't take the shoe away from me, please, please!

1317
01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:57.964
Please, it's my shoe!

1318
01:27:59.106 --> 01:28:00.339
Make way for the slipper!

1319
01:28:09.883 --> 01:28:11.050
Can I try the other foot?

1320
01:28:11.052 --> 01:28:12.332
I don't think so.

1321
01:28:13.387 --> 01:28:16.122
<i>But whatever they tried,</i>

1322
01:28:16.124 --> 01:28:19.558
<i>the magical slipper refused to fit
even the most eligible of maidens.</i>

1323
01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:22.061
We found the mystery princess for ya!

1324
01:28:32.472 --> 01:28:34.040
What's wrong, Captain?

1325
01:28:35.108 --> 01:28:37.343
We haven't found the girl.

1326
01:28:37.345 --> 01:28:39.178
I'm disappointed for our king.

1327
01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.447
Oh, come on, now!
Don't lose heart.

1328
01:28:41.449 --> 01:28:43.783
There's one more house.

1329
01:28:43.785 --> 01:28:46.145
We must leave no stone unturned.

1330
01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:49.121
Horses!
Horses!

1331
01:28:49.123 --> 01:28:51.957
Mother, it's our chance!

1332
01:28:55.429 --> 01:28:57.196
Let them in!

1333
01:29:09.843 --> 01:29:13.212
Gentlemen!
What a wonderful surprise.

1334
01:29:13.214 --> 01:29:15.047
A moment of your time, good lady.

1335
01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.849
Of course, Your Grace.

1336
01:29:16.851 --> 01:29:18.684
Please. This way.

1337
01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:23.055
<i>Ella did not know who was downstairs.</i>

1338
01:29:23.057 --> 01:29:25.491
<i>Nor did she care.</i>

1339
01:29:25.493 --> 01:29:27.226
<i>For surely no one had come to see her.</i>

1340
01:29:27.228 --> 01:29:28.394
Jacqueline, stop it!

1341
01:29:35.802 --> 01:29:37.737
It shrunk.

1342
01:29:37.739 --> 01:29:39.138
Try again.

1343
01:29:48.014 --> 01:29:49.315
Oh, enough!

1344
01:29:53.087 --> 01:29:54.487
<i>Though Ella was sad,</i>

1345
01:29:54.489 --> 01:29:55.921
<i>her spirit was not broken.</i>

1346
01:29:55.923 --> 01:29:58.057
<i>She knew that the ball,</i>

1347
01:29:58.059 --> 01:29:59.925
<i>and her time with the prince,</i>

1348
01:29:59.927 --> 01:30:02.361
<i>would become beautiful, distant memories,</i>

1349
01:30:02.363 --> 01:30:04.764
<i>like those of her father and mother,</i>

1350
01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:06.632
<i>and her golden childhood.</i>

1351
01:30:14.107 --> 01:30:18.344
It fits me!

1352
01:30:19.446 --> 01:30:21.380
Bad luck, miss.

1353
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:35.861
<i>Very well.</i>

1354
01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:37.897
Our task is done, Captain.

1355
01:30:37.899 --> 01:30:41.333
But fate may yet be kind to us, girls.

1356
01:30:43.738 --> 01:30:45.304
Indeed, madam!

1357
01:31:14.134 --> 01:31:15.574
Do you hear that, Your Grace?

1358
01:31:16.837 --> 01:31:17.970
Let's be off, Captain.

1359
01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:19.071
Just a moment.

1360
01:31:22.676 --> 01:31:24.109
Madam,

1361
01:31:24.111 --> 01:31:26.745
there is no other maiden in your house?

1362
01:31:29.082 --> 01:31:30.416
None.

1363
01:31:31.852 --> 01:31:33.586
Then has your cat learned to sing?

1364
01:31:41.194 --> 01:31:44.196
There's been enough play-acting today, Captain.
Let's be off.

1365
01:31:44.198 --> 01:31:46.499
But she's lying, Your Grace.

1366
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.834
Nonsense! I trust the lady.
We're leaving.

1367
01:31:48.836 --> 01:31:49.836
Grand Duke!

1368
01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:57.977
Your Majesty.

1369
01:31:57.979 --> 01:32:00.713
What sweet singing.
Makes me want to tarry just a little.

1370
01:32:01.715 --> 01:32:03.649
Your Majesty, I did not know...

1371
01:32:03.651 --> 01:32:05.718
Captain, would you be so kind as to investigate?

1372
01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:08.888
It would be my pleasure, Your Majesty.

1373
01:32:17.197 --> 01:32:19.698
There! You see?

1374
01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.867
I told you it was no one of any importance.

1375
01:32:21.869 --> 01:32:23.369
We'll see about that.

1376
01:32:25.305 --> 01:32:26.405
Miss.

1377
01:32:29.543 --> 01:32:33.212
You are requested and required to
present yourself to your king.

1378
01:32:33.214 --> 01:32:35.414
I forbid you to do this!

1379
01:32:35.416 --> 01:32:37.383
And I forbid you to forbid her!

1380
01:32:38.518 --> 01:32:40.198
Who are you to stop an officer of the king?

1381
01:32:40.754 --> 01:32:42.154
Are you an empress?

1382
01:32:42.856 --> 01:32:43.856
A saint?

1383
01:32:44.257 --> 01:32:45.624
A deity?

1384
01:32:46.259 --> 01:32:47.660
I am her mother.

1385
01:32:53.400 --> 01:32:55.234
You have never been...

1386
01:32:56.603 --> 01:32:59.405
and you never will be my mother.

1387
01:33:03.777 --> 01:33:05.277
Come now, miss.

1388
01:33:10.383 --> 01:33:13.185
Just remember who you are, you wretch!

1389
01:33:28.101 --> 01:33:29.535
<i>Would who she was,</i>

1390
01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:32.471
<i>who she really was, be enough?</i>

1391
01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:35.541
<i>There was no magic to help her this time.</i>

1392
01:33:35.543 --> 01:33:39.044
<i>This is perhaps the greatest
risk that any of us will take.</i>

1393
01:33:39.046 --> 01:33:42.348
<i>To be seen as we truly are.</i>

1394
01:33:43.783 --> 01:33:47.386
<i>Have courage, and be kind.</i>

1395
01:34:27.794 --> 01:34:29.028
Who are you?

1396
01:34:31.097 --> 01:34:32.765
I am Cinderella.

1397
01:34:35.969 --> 01:34:37.403
Your Majesty...

1398
01:34:39.839 --> 01:34:41.440
I'm no princess.

1399
01:34:43.109 --> 01:34:44.743
I have no carriage,

1400
01:34:45.979 --> 01:34:47.446
no parents,

1401
01:34:48.381 --> 01:34:50.015
and no dowry.

1402
01:34:51.785 --> 01:34:54.386
I do not even know if that beautiful slipper will fit.

1403
01:34:54.388 --> 01:34:55.788
But...

1404
01:34:57.991 --> 01:34:59.391
if it does...

1405
01:35:01.294 --> 01:35:03.562
will you take me as I am?

1406
01:35:05.398 --> 01:35:07.900
An honest country girl who loves you.

1407
01:35:07.902 --> 01:35:09.702
Of course I will.

1408
01:35:11.237 --> 01:35:14.506
But only if you will take me as I am.

1409
01:35:14.508 --> 01:35:16.988
An apprentice still learning his trade.

1410
01:35:18.578 --> 01:35:19.578
Please.

1411
01:36:05.358 --> 01:36:06.625
Cinderella!

1412
01:36:06.627 --> 01:36:07.693
Ella!

1413
01:36:08.862 --> 01:36:12.297
My dear sister!
I'm sorry.

1414
01:36:12.299 --> 01:36:13.932
So very sorry.

1415
01:36:30.416 --> 01:36:31.717
Shall we?

1416
01:37:12.625 --> 01:37:13.926
I forgive you.

1417
01:37:23.703 --> 01:37:25.003
<i>Forgiven or not,</i>

1418
01:37:25.005 --> 01:37:28.040
<i>Cinderella's stepmother and her daughters</i>

1419
01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:30.175
<i>would soon leave with the Grand Duke,</i>

1420
01:37:30.177 --> 01:37:32.878
<i>and never set foot in the kingdom again.</i>

1421
01:37:41.821 --> 01:37:43.722
They would have loved each other.

1422
01:37:43.724 --> 01:37:46.191
We must have a portrait of you painted.

1423
01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:48.827
Oh, no. I do hate myself in paintings.

1424
01:37:48.829 --> 01:37:51.230
Be kind.

1425
01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:53.031
And have courage.

1426
01:37:53.033 --> 01:37:54.600
And all will be well.

1427
01:38:02.242 --> 01:38:03.742
Are you ready?

1428
01:38:03.744 --> 01:38:06.078
For anything, so long as it's with you.

1429
01:38:17.357 --> 01:38:18.757
My queen.

1430
01:38:19.259 --> 01:38:20.559
My Kit.

1431
01:38:33.039 --> 01:38:36.775
<i>And so Kit and Ella were married,</i>

1432
01:38:36.777 --> 01:38:39.611
<i>and I can tell you, as her fairy godmother,</i>

1433
01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:41.246
<i>that they were counted to be</i>

1434
01:38:41.248 --> 01:38:46.451
<i>the fairest and kindest rulers the kingdom had known.</i>

1435
01:38:46.453 --> 01:38:50.589
<i>And Ella continued to see the world not as it is,</i>

1436
01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:52.958
<i>but as it could be,</i>

1437
01:38:52.960 --> 01:38:55.961
<i>if only you believe in courage...</i>

1438
01:38:55.963 --> 01:38:59.131
<i>and kindness and occasionally...</i>

1439
01:38:59.133 --> 01:39:02.968
<i>just a little bit of magic.</i>

1440
01:44:17.883 --> 01:44:20.952
<i>- Well done, Ella.
- My turn?</i>

1441
01:45:13.272 --> 01:45:14.406
<i>Hmm, where did everyone go?</i>
