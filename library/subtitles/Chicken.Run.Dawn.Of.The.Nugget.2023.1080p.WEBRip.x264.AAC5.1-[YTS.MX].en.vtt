00:00:18.168 --> 00:00:20.084
<i>Hey. How you doin' in there?</i>

2
00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:23.418
<i>You sitting comfortably?
All settled in? Okay, good.</i>

3
00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:25.126
<i>Now, listen.</i>

4
00:00:25.959 --> 00:00:28.043
<i>I'm gonna tell you a story.</i>

5
00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:32.209
<i>It's all about the time
we escaped from a chicken farm.</i>

6
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:35.251
<i>There was this farmer, see?</i>

7
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:38.959
- <i>And she absolutely hated chickens.</i>

8
00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:40.793
<i>Kept them locked up
like prisoners.</i>

9
00:00:40.793 --> 00:00:44.584
<i>I guess you could say
she had a real</i> axe <i>to grind.</i>

10
00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:47.668
<i>Got herself a machine
that turned chickens into pies.</i>

11
00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:50.168
We mustn't panic!

12
00:00:53.376 --> 00:00:56.376
<i>But what she didn't plan on
was going toe to toe</i>

13
00:00:56.376 --> 00:00:59.376
<i>with a certain freedom-fighting chick.</i>

14
00:00:59.376 --> 00:01:03.751
<i>She was fierce, fearless,
and wanted one thing and one thing only.</i>

15
00:01:03.751 --> 00:01:05.084
- Freedom.

16
00:01:06.209 --> 00:01:07.834
<i>She pulled us all together</i>...

17
00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:12.043
<i>...and gave us the wings
to fly right outta that hen-hole.</i>

18
00:01:12.043 --> 00:01:15.001
<i>- She got every chicken out of there.</i>

19
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:17.918
<i>And got rid of that wicked farmer
to boot.</i>

20
00:01:17.918 --> 00:01:19.043
Huh?

21
00:01:19.043 --> 00:01:20.959
- Bye-bye.

22
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:26.126
And you know
who that freedom-fighting chicken was?

23
00:01:27.334 --> 00:01:29.376
- Your very own mom.

24
00:01:29.376 --> 00:01:34.959
Rocky, don't you think bedtime stories
might be a bit premature?

25
00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:39.418
Well... I mean, you're never too young
to learn where you came from.

26
00:01:42.584 --> 00:01:45.084
But those days are over, thank goodness.

27
00:01:46.126 --> 00:01:47.959
We've got our happy ending.

28
00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:49.793
We're living in it.

29
00:01:52.834 --> 00:01:54.293
Your way, Mac.

30
00:01:54.293 --> 00:01:56.126
More fruit coming, Bunty.

31
00:01:56.126 --> 00:02:00.876
Oh! Oh, thanks, Mac,
'cause I'm working up a thirst here.

32
00:02:00.876 --> 00:02:04.584
-  Good work, Bunty. Keep it up.

33
00:02:04.584 --> 00:02:05.834
You know what?

34
00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:09.334
I think it's time
to put the past behind us.

35
00:02:09.334 --> 00:02:12.751
-  Turned out nice again.
- Ooh, yeah. Lovely.

36
00:02:13.251 --> 00:02:14.418
Past?

37
00:02:14.418 --> 00:02:15.959
What past?

38
00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:19.834
<i>That</i> past, behind us.

39
00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.043
But these,
these are our glory days.

40
00:02:24.043 --> 00:02:25.793
That's who we are.

41
00:02:25.793 --> 00:02:27.501
It's who we <i>were</i>.

42
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:31.168
We went through all that
so our baby doesn't have to.

43
00:02:32.584 --> 00:02:36.001
Y'know, you are right.

44
00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.543
From now on,
our only mission is to keep our baby safe.

45
00:02:42.043 --> 00:02:44.959
Don't you worry.
Ol' Rocky here is on the case.

46
00:02:46.043 --> 00:02:48.876
-  What do I do? What do I do?

47
00:02:48.876 --> 00:02:50.418
-  Whoo-hoo!
- It's hopping!

48
00:02:50.418 --> 00:02:51.668
- Just grab it!

49
00:02:51.668 --> 00:02:53.043
-  Whee!

50
00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.668
- Oh no!

51
00:02:56.668 --> 00:02:57.959
- Whoops!

52
00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.043
Egg's up!

53
00:02:59.043 --> 00:03:00.918
Good grief. A live shell.

54
00:03:00.918 --> 00:03:03.001
- Clear the area!

55
00:03:03.001 --> 00:03:05.376
-  Whoo-hoo!
-  Oh! Get it!

56
00:03:05.376 --> 00:03:06.918
-  Watch out!
-  Huh?

57
00:03:06.918 --> 00:03:08.543
{\an8}-  No!

58
00:03:12.376 --> 00:03:17.084
{\an8}

59
00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:25.459
Would you look at that.

60
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.209
We've got ourselves a family.

61
00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.168
Huh?

62
00:03:30.168 --> 00:03:32.626
Oh, look at her, Rocky.

63
00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:36.334
-  She's perfect.

64
00:03:36.918 --> 00:03:38.834
Welcome to the world.

65
00:03:41.668 --> 00:03:43.251
-  Molly.
-  Mm.

66
00:03:43.251 --> 00:03:46.043
Ah, what a bonny wee hen.

67
00:03:46.043 --> 00:03:49.793
Oh, she's got
her father's spindly little legs.

68
00:03:49.793 --> 00:03:51.543
We need to build them up, what, what.

69
00:03:52.126 --> 00:03:56.668
When I was in the RAF,
we did 50 squats before breakfast.

70
00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:58.959
-  Ah. Oh.

71
00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.126
That's gone.

72
00:04:00.126 --> 00:04:02.668
- I made her a bicycle.
- Really?

73
00:04:02.668 --> 00:04:04.084
Mm-hmm.

74
00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:06.418
Oh. You knitted one.

75
00:04:06.418 --> 00:04:09.126
What a lovely... thought.

76
00:04:09.876 --> 00:04:11.459
Thank you, Babs.

77
00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:17.251
Y'know, I'd say our little island paradise
just got a little more

78
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.959
"paradisier."

79
00:04:20.543 --> 00:04:24.959

Hi, Mum.

132
00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:12.709
- Oh. Hello, darling.
- Hi, Dad!

133
00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:14.959
Uncle Nick! Uncle Fetcher!

134
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:18.084
She just called me "uncle."

135
00:07:18.084 --> 00:07:20.334
Steady, mate. Steady.

136
00:07:20.334 --> 00:07:23.001
But I've never had
a family of me own.

137
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:24.126
Me neither.

138
00:07:26.876 --> 00:07:31.334
Mum, I was thinking. Can we go over there?

139
00:07:31.334 --> 00:07:32.293
Where, love?

140
00:07:32.293 --> 00:07:34.251
The other side of the water.

141
00:07:43.668 --> 00:07:46.876
Oh, we've spoken about this, Molly.

142
00:07:46.876 --> 00:07:49.459
- There's nothing over there for us.

143
00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:51.501
What about stuff Uncle Nick
and Fetch bring?

144
00:07:52.084 --> 00:07:53.918
Isn't that for us?

145
00:07:53.918 --> 00:07:55.626
Hey. What's up, Ginge?

146
00:07:55.626 --> 00:07:57.543
Rocky.

147
00:07:57.543 --> 00:08:01.418
Molly's asking about <i>going off the island</i>.

148
00:08:01.418 --> 00:08:02.418
Oh, right.

149
00:08:02.918 --> 00:08:04.459
<i>Oh</i>, right.

150
00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:06.334
Hey, Molly.

151
00:08:06.334 --> 00:08:09.084
Do you wanna see
the world's coolest invention?

152
00:08:09.876 --> 00:08:11.209
Hmm.

153
00:08:12.918 --> 00:08:13.834
Okay.

154
00:08:19.293 --> 00:08:21.709
- What is it, Dad?

155
00:08:22.918 --> 00:08:25.543
Only the answer to all of life's problems.

156
00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:27.918
Popcorn.

157
00:08:28.793 --> 00:08:30.168
Mm!

158
00:08:30.168 --> 00:08:34.293
- Is that the best thing ever or what?

159
00:08:34.293 --> 00:08:37.959
- Mm! It <i>is</i> good.
-  "Good"?

160
00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:40.043
This is <i>great</i>!

161
00:08:42.418 --> 00:08:46.501
Life, my girl,
doesn't get better than this.

162
00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:06.043
-  Mum, what is it?
- It's nothing to worry about, Molly.

163
00:09:07.209 --> 00:09:08.459
Nothing at all.

164
00:09:22.084 --> 00:09:26.043
Well, it was only a matter of time
before the humans showed up.

165
00:09:28.834 --> 00:09:32.834
It looks like they're taking them
to some kind of chicken farm.

166
00:09:35.043 --> 00:09:37.084
- Uh-oh.

167
00:09:37.084 --> 00:09:40.209
I haven't seen that look in a long while.

168
00:09:41.001 --> 00:09:44.834
You can't right
all the world's wrongs, duck.

169
00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.459
Meeting tonight. Spread the word.

170
00:09:47.959 --> 00:09:50.209
Here we go again.

171
00:09:55.459 --> 00:09:58.168
-  What's going on, Mum?

172
00:09:58.168 --> 00:10:02.001
Why can't I go up my tree anymore?
What's this meeting about?

173
00:10:02.001 --> 00:10:04.168
It's nothing, Molly.

174
00:10:04.168 --> 00:10:06.459
It's, um, just...

175
00:10:06.459 --> 00:10:09.918
There's some quite big wasps
up there this year.

176
00:10:09.918 --> 00:10:11.709
Really?

177
00:10:11.709 --> 00:10:16.126
Besides, I need someone to stay here
and look after your dad.

178
00:10:21.334 --> 00:10:23.418
Don't worry. I'm good.

179
00:10:23.418 --> 00:10:25.459
Okay.

180
00:10:26.084 --> 00:10:28.751
Maybe while you're out,
he can tell me a story.

181
00:10:28.751 --> 00:10:29.918
Good idea.

182
00:10:30.876 --> 00:10:33.126
Good night, my big, brave girl.

183
00:10:36.834 --> 00:10:39.459
-  Good night, Ginge. Good luck.

184
00:10:40.918 --> 00:10:43.376
Okay, Mollypod. What do you wanna do?

185
00:10:43.376 --> 00:10:49.084
Well, I thought
you could tell me about... this.

186
00:10:49.584 --> 00:10:51.876
Oh!

187
00:10:51.876 --> 00:10:56.334
Uh, uh, uh, that... that is... not me.

188
00:11:02.626 --> 00:11:07.668
{\an8}Okay. Yes, it's me.
But it was a long time ago.

189
00:11:08.668 --> 00:11:09.918
And?

190
00:11:10.418 --> 00:11:11.418
And,

191
00:11:12.543 --> 00:11:13.793
actually,

192
00:11:14.709 --> 00:11:17.334
it's a... it's a pretty good story.

193
00:11:19.209 --> 00:11:21.126
It's not just eggs
they want from us.

194
00:11:21.126 --> 00:11:23.126
Ginger has that look about her.

195
00:11:23.126 --> 00:11:26.459
I reckon she'll have us charging
right into the fray.

196
00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:29.043
I don't want to charge into any frays.

197
00:11:29.043 --> 00:11:30.543
I... I'm fray-phobic.

198
00:11:30.543 --> 00:11:34.459
- All right, everyone! Please, quiet!
-  Wait. She's starting.

199
00:11:34.459 --> 00:11:36.293
-  Quiet!
-  Shut your beak.

200
00:11:36.293 --> 00:11:39.793
- Now, we all know about the new road.

201
00:11:42.084 --> 00:11:47.126
And the trucks taking chickens
to what looks like some kind of farm.

202
00:11:47.126 --> 00:11:49.376
A farm?

203
00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:51.959
No, it's all right, Beryl. Listen. Listen.

204
00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:55.251
We know from experience
what that can mean.

205
00:11:56.168 --> 00:11:58.834
It's something we just can't ignore.

206
00:12:00.001 --> 00:12:02.918
We really only have one choice.

207
00:12:02.918 --> 00:12:05.043
I don't want to hear it.

208
00:12:05.043 --> 00:12:06.751
We've got to do something.

209
00:12:09.584 --> 00:12:11.168
We have to hide.

210
00:12:11.168 --> 00:12:12.834
-  Ah?
-  Huh?

211
00:12:14.918 --> 00:12:15.876
Hide?

212
00:12:15.876 --> 00:12:17.751
Yes. Hide!

213
00:12:17.751 --> 00:12:20.626
- You mean, pretend we're not here?

214
00:12:21.293 --> 00:12:22.209
Exactly.

215
00:12:31.626 --> 00:12:34.876
Operation Lie Low. Jolly good.

216
00:12:34.876 --> 00:12:38.293
Ooh! I like lilos.
Especially the stripy ones.

217
00:12:38.293 --> 00:12:39.543
She's right, you know.

218
00:12:39.543 --> 00:12:42.001
- It's really not our problem.
-  Oh, you!

219
00:12:42.001 --> 00:12:43.751
Are you all right, hen?

220
00:12:44.459 --> 00:12:47.126
It's not like you to shy away from danger.

221
00:12:47.626 --> 00:12:51.043
I know, but I have Molly
to think about now.

222
00:12:51.043 --> 00:12:52.126
And I...

223
00:12:52.126 --> 00:12:54.418
<i>We</i> can't risk our freedom

224
00:12:54.418 --> 00:12:57.626
by venturing into a world
that finds chickens so...

225
00:12:59.376 --> 00:13:00.501
delicious.

226
00:13:08.918 --> 00:13:10.001
Lift!

227
00:13:19.543 --> 00:13:21.043
Right.

228
00:13:21.043 --> 00:13:25.376
All we have to do now is keep quiet
and not draw attention to ourselves.

229
00:13:25.376 --> 00:13:29.293
-  Cock-a-doodle-doo!

230
00:13:33.793 --> 00:13:35.126
Rocky!

231
00:13:35.126 --> 00:13:41.376
Um, given our new situation,
maybe you shouldn't crow anymore.

232
00:13:44.043 --> 00:13:45.834
Don't crow?

233
00:13:45.834 --> 00:13:48.459
What?
But that's, like, my thing.

234
00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:51.001
Maybe you could do a different thing.

235
00:13:51.001 --> 00:13:52.084
A quieter one?

236
00:13:52.084 --> 00:13:53.918
Wow! Look at this!

237
00:13:53.918 --> 00:13:55.751
Molly! Get away from that.

238
00:13:55.751 --> 00:13:59.376
- Ginge, can we talk about the whole...
-  She's right, you know.

239
00:14:00.668 --> 00:14:04.709
- Careless squawks cost lives.

240
00:14:04.709 --> 00:14:06.501
We have to lie low.

241
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:09.793
I'm running a camouflage lesson at noon.

242
00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:12.751
<i>If</i> you can find me.

243
00:14:14.626 --> 00:14:15.834
-  Ooh.

244
00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:19.626
What's it for, Mum?

245
00:14:23.626 --> 00:14:26.209
Oh! What is that?

246
00:14:28.876 --> 00:14:31.543
It's got a chicken sitting
in a bucket on it.

247
00:14:31.543 --> 00:14:33.376
It's doing this.

248
00:14:33.376 --> 00:14:35.418
Oh, that's so funny.

249
00:14:35.418 --> 00:14:37.834
Uh, let's go home.

250
00:14:42.501 --> 00:14:45.043
Where are they going?
Can we go with them?

251
00:14:45.043 --> 00:14:47.376
- It looks like a lot of fun.
- I'm sorry, Molly.

252
00:14:47.376 --> 00:14:49.834
- You're not ready to go off the island.
- But I...

253
00:14:49.834 --> 00:14:52.501
Uh, Rocky? Little help?

254
00:14:52.501 --> 00:14:54.959
Maybe I could crow on weekends. Y'know?

255
00:14:54.959 --> 00:14:56.418
Why am I not ready?

256
00:14:56.418 --> 00:14:57.793
I'm a big, brave girl.

257
00:14:57.793 --> 00:15:00.043
- You always say so.
- I know.

258
00:15:00.043 --> 00:15:01.751
But you're still a child.

259
00:15:01.751 --> 00:15:03.209
Says who?

260
00:15:03.209 --> 00:15:05.418
Says me and your dad.

261
00:15:05.418 --> 00:15:06.584
Right, Rocky?

262
00:15:06.584 --> 00:15:10.001
Yeah, that's right. That's right. Yes.
Listen to your mom, kiddo.

263
00:15:10.001 --> 00:15:14.001
Oh! Oh. How about just half a crow?
Like a "cock-a" or "doodle-doo"?

264
00:15:14.001 --> 00:15:15.543
Something that's a little shorter.

265
00:15:15.543 --> 00:15:20.876
Well, I'm going over to see those trucks
because I am a Lone Free Ranger.

266
00:15:20.876 --> 00:15:22.209
Like Dad was.

267
00:15:23.209 --> 00:15:24.626
I've seen his poster.

268
00:15:24.626 --> 00:15:25.751
Ah.

269
00:15:25.751 --> 00:15:28.459
He used to live over there,
and you did too.

270
00:15:31.293 --> 00:15:34.334
Did I say that? I don't... I don't remember.

271
00:15:34.334 --> 00:15:35.418
That's it.

272
00:15:35.418 --> 00:15:37.918
Molly, you are not leaving this island.

273
00:15:37.918 --> 00:15:40.876
You can't make me stay here.
You're not the boss of me.

274
00:15:40.876 --> 00:15:43.126
Actually, I am.

275
00:15:43.876 --> 00:15:48.501
Look, Molly, you've got
everything you want right here.

276
00:15:48.501 --> 00:15:50.626
Except for one thing.

277
00:15:50.626 --> 00:15:52.001
And what's that?

278
00:15:53.876 --> 00:15:55.126
Freedom.

279
00:16:02.126 --> 00:16:06.501
- You know, she <i>is</i> a lot like you.

280
00:16:06.501 --> 00:16:09.751
Mm.

281
00:16:33.834 --> 00:16:36.668
Your daughter
is going to be delicious!

282
00:16:36.668 --> 00:16:39.543
-  Not the face! Not the face!

283
00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:45.668
- Huh?
-  Molly?

284
00:16:47.709 --> 00:16:50.334
-  Molly?

285
00:16:50.334 --> 00:16:51.959
-  Come out, Molly!
-  Molly!

286
00:16:51.959 --> 00:16:53.293
-  Molly?
-  Molly?

287
00:16:53.293 --> 00:16:54.668
-  Molly!
-  Molly!

288
00:16:54.668 --> 00:16:56.376
-  Molly?
- Molly!

289
00:16:56.376 --> 00:16:58.043
-  Come out, Molly.

290
00:17:06.418 --> 00:17:07.251
No!

291
00:17:07.251 --> 00:17:10.543
- She's left the island.

292
00:17:16.043 --> 00:17:17.584
This isn't so bad.

293
00:17:18.209 --> 00:17:19.709
Don't know what Mum was worried about.

294
00:17:19.709 --> 00:17:23.251
I'm big and I'm brave.

295
00:17:23.251 --> 00:17:24.751
Yeah, course I am.

296
00:17:25.251 --> 00:17:27.709
I'm big...

297
00:17:28.793 --> 00:17:29.876
- And...

298
00:17:29.876 --> 00:17:31.501
...not very brave.

299
00:17:46.376 --> 00:17:47.376
Huh?

300
00:17:50.501 --> 00:17:51.376
Hmm?

301
00:17:57.751 --> 00:18:00.793
What were you doin'?
Have you got a death wish?

302
00:18:00.793 --> 00:18:02.126
No.

303
00:18:04.584 --> 00:18:06.876
Wait, what's a death wish?

304
00:18:09.251 --> 00:18:12.418
Isn't it a bit late
for you to be out, baby girl?

305
00:18:12.418 --> 00:18:14.418
I'm not a baby girl.

306
00:18:14.918 --> 00:18:16.793
I'm a... I'm a big, brave girl.

307
00:18:17.293 --> 00:18:20.376
And isn't it a bit late
for you to be out too?

308
00:18:22.793 --> 00:18:25.251
Okay, I like it.

309
00:18:25.751 --> 00:18:27.209
Give as good as you get, eh?

310
00:18:27.709 --> 00:18:29.834
Well, I'm Frizzle.

311
00:18:30.876 --> 00:18:32.126
And you are?

312
00:18:33.459 --> 00:18:34.334
Molly.

313
00:18:34.834 --> 00:18:36.793
Although,
it's kind of a goofy name.

314
00:18:36.793 --> 00:18:38.459
So I'm thinking of changing it to...

315
00:18:38.459 --> 00:18:39.501
Zip it, kidda.

316
00:18:39.501 --> 00:18:42.668
- It's stoppin'. Now's our chance.

317
00:18:44.251 --> 00:18:46.834
- Are you comin' or not?
- Coming where?

318
00:18:46.834 --> 00:18:48.959
To the happy chicken truck.

319
00:18:48.959 --> 00:18:50.834
You've seen them too?

320
00:18:50.834 --> 00:18:52.376
Right.

321
00:18:53.543 --> 00:18:55.668
Wherever that truck's goin',

322
00:18:55.668 --> 00:18:59.001
it's gonna be cooler
than a penguin's toenails.

323
00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:02.126
Uh, what's a toenail?

324
00:19:02.751 --> 00:19:04.084
What's a penguin?

325
00:19:04.084 --> 00:19:08.084
Oh! You have got so much to learn.
Come on.

326
00:19:10.001 --> 00:19:11.918
Wait for me!

327
00:19:12.709 --> 00:19:15.959
I mean, so she found my poster,
and I told her a story.

328
00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:18.334
I don't think that's such a big deal.

329
00:19:18.334 --> 00:19:21.584
Oh no. It was perfectly sensible
to encourage our daughter

330
00:19:21.584 --> 00:19:23.418
to be a Lone Free Ranger.

331
00:19:23.418 --> 00:19:26.084
You know, if you had it your way,
she'd still be in her shell.

332
00:19:26.084 --> 00:19:29.084
Well, better in her shell
than out on the open road.

333
00:19:29.084 --> 00:19:32.709
So, do you live on an island too?

334
00:19:32.709 --> 00:19:35.876
Nah. I was stuck on a boring old farm.

335
00:19:35.876 --> 00:19:39.251
Then the trucks came,
and they said I was too small to go.

336
00:19:39.251 --> 00:19:40.793
But that's not gonna stop me.

337
00:19:40.793 --> 00:19:42.668
You get to sit in a bucket.

338
00:19:43.168 --> 00:19:45.376
What chicken doesn't want
their own bucket?

339
00:19:45.376 --> 00:19:47.293
I want a bucket.

340
00:19:47.293 --> 00:19:48.751
The thing about us, Mol,

341
00:19:48.751 --> 00:19:52.501
is that we wanna go
where we wanna go whenever we want.

342
00:19:52.501 --> 00:19:55.918
Yeah. With nobody telling us
what we can and can't do.

343
00:19:57.043 --> 00:19:59.668
Me and you, kidda. All the way.

344
00:20:04.334 --> 00:20:05.959
Holy moly.

345
00:20:08.376 --> 00:20:12.126
Hear that? It's like a party in there.

346
00:20:16.876 --> 00:20:18.918
Oh!

347
00:20:19.668 --> 00:20:21.709
What is that?

348
00:20:22.209 --> 00:20:24.418
You've never seen a human before?

349
00:20:26.126 --> 00:20:28.084
We had them back at the farm.

350
00:20:28.084 --> 00:20:30.126
They're kinda stupid.

351
00:20:30.126 --> 00:20:33.751
They fed us and tidied up after us.
They're basically like waitin' staff.

352
00:20:33.751 --> 00:20:35.001
Oi!

353
00:20:35.001 --> 00:20:36.293
- Oi, you!
- Huh?

354
00:20:36.793 --> 00:20:38.668
How did you two get out here?

355
00:20:38.668 --> 00:20:40.793
- What do you say, Molly?
-  Uh...

356
00:20:40.793 --> 00:20:43.584
Do you want to come
on the adventure of a lifetime or not?

357
00:20:44.376 --> 00:20:46.043
Uh...

358
00:20:47.168 --> 00:20:48.418
- Oh no!
-  Oh no!

359
00:20:48.418 --> 00:20:49.918
- Molly!

360
00:20:55.001 --> 00:20:55.918
{\an8}Ginger!

361
00:21:00.876 --> 00:21:01.834
- Huh?

362
00:21:09.376 --> 00:21:11.668
- Molly!

363
00:21:14.668 --> 00:21:15.959
I know what you're thinking.

364
00:21:15.959 --> 00:21:17.626
Where are the buckets?

365
00:21:18.126 --> 00:21:20.293
I bet they give 'em to us
when we get there.

366
00:21:20.293 --> 00:21:22.501
- Are we nearly there yet?
- Molly!

367
00:21:25.334 --> 00:21:27.251
Huh?

368
00:21:28.584 --> 00:21:29.959
Hello.

369
00:21:41.918 --> 00:21:43.959
There go the goujons!

370
00:21:43.959 --> 00:21:46.709
- Hang on, Fowler!
- What do you think I'm doing?

371
00:21:53.418 --> 00:21:55.168
Molly!

372
00:22:06.751 --> 00:22:09.126
- Well, hey. That doesn't look so bad.

373
00:22:13.793 --> 00:22:17.376
- Oh, that looks so bad.

374
00:22:34.584 --> 00:22:36.168
Right. Stop here.

375
00:22:37.918 --> 00:22:39.626
- Let's have a look.

376
00:22:40.709 --> 00:22:42.709
- Okay, all clear.
- On your way.

377
00:23:14.793 --> 00:23:16.209
We mustn't panic.

378
00:23:16.209 --> 00:23:18.126
- No. No panicking.
- I don't like it.

379
00:23:18.126 --> 00:23:21.668
It's a perfect time to panic.
The enemy has the upper hand.

380
00:23:21.668 --> 00:23:23.251
We must keep our heads!

381
00:23:23.251 --> 00:23:26.001
- Where should we keep them?
-  I'm trying to think here.

382
00:23:26.001 --> 00:23:28.626
- No panicking. No. I said no panicking!

383
00:23:28.626 --> 00:23:31.626
- Ginger, what do <i>you</i> say?
-  What did I say?

384
00:23:34.209 --> 00:23:38.876
I say, last time,
we broke out of a chicken farm.

385
00:23:39.376 --> 00:23:42.751
Well, this time, we're breaking <i>in</i>.

386
00:23:52.126 --> 00:23:54.626
Ooh!

387
00:23:56.376 --> 00:23:58.876
-  It smells funny.
-  This is not what I expected.

388
00:23:58.876 --> 00:24:03.251
- This is, uh... cool, isn't it?

389
00:24:05.043 --> 00:24:07.709
That's it, my lovelies.

390
00:24:07.709 --> 00:24:10.293
Come on down.

391
00:24:14.084 --> 00:24:15.626
- Ah.

392
00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:22.251
- I don't fancy that.

393
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:23.709
- Come on.
- Huh?

394
00:24:24.918 --> 00:24:26.001
Over here.

395
00:24:29.209 --> 00:24:31.001
- Ooh!
-  Huh?

396
00:24:47.251 --> 00:24:48.209
Huh?

397
00:24:49.751 --> 00:24:51.793
-  Wow.

398
00:24:57.959 --> 00:25:02.334
Did I promise you
the adventure of a lifetime or what?

399
00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:05.334
- Come on. Let's play.

400
00:25:06.334 --> 00:25:08.084
Whoo-hoo!

401
00:25:08.084 --> 00:25:09.834
-  Yeah!

402
00:25:09.834 --> 00:25:11.834
Let's go in the pool.

403
00:25:15.334 --> 00:25:17.751
Listen, everyone. We can do this.

404
00:25:17.751 --> 00:25:20.501
- We just need a really clever plan.
- Ooh. Ooh.

405
00:25:20.501 --> 00:25:22.334
Okay. I've got this. I've got this.

406
00:25:23.334 --> 00:25:28.376
I'm gonna go in there,
and I'm gonna bust Molly out.

407
00:25:28.876 --> 00:25:31.834
And just how the bloomin' heck
are you going to do that?

408
00:25:32.543 --> 00:25:37.543
Well, by, uh... uh, y'know, going in there

409
00:25:37.543 --> 00:25:40.043
and then... busting her out.

410
00:25:41.084 --> 00:25:43.001
That's not a plan.

411
00:25:43.001 --> 00:25:45.126
That's just saying
what you wish would happen.

412
00:25:45.126 --> 00:25:46.959
Aye, and 12 herrings and a bagpipe

413
00:25:46.959 --> 00:25:50.209
are just a pile of mince
if you havnae kent the rules.

414
00:25:50.209 --> 00:25:52.834
You know,
that sounded a little negative to me.

415
00:25:52.834 --> 00:25:55.293
Mac's right. We need more details.

416
00:25:55.793 --> 00:25:58.668
We only get one shot at this,
so we need to make sure

417
00:25:58.668 --> 00:26:02.334
that every move we make
is carefully thought through.

418
00:26:02.334 --> 00:26:04.043
We can't just rush in and...

419
00:26:04.043 --> 00:26:07.084
- Uh, Rocky?

420
00:26:09.376 --> 00:26:10.626
What are you doing?

421
00:26:11.126 --> 00:26:13.959
Sometimes you just gotta take a leap, Ginger.

422
00:26:14.834 --> 00:26:16.418
- You ready, Fowler?
- Ready.

423
00:26:16.918 --> 00:26:18.043
- Fire.
- Rocky.

424
00:26:25.251 --> 00:26:26.668
Cock-a-doodle...

425
00:26:26.668 --> 00:26:28.709
Huh?

426
00:26:37.209 --> 00:26:39.293
- Huh?

427
00:26:59.126 --> 00:27:01.459
-  Whoa!

428
00:27:10.376 --> 00:27:11.584
Huh?

429
00:27:30.876 --> 00:27:32.626
- Huh?

430
00:27:39.709 --> 00:27:41.876
Ooh, that went well.

431
00:27:42.918 --> 00:27:45.376
Well, one good thing.

432
00:27:45.876 --> 00:27:47.834
At least now we've got the details.

433
00:27:47.834 --> 00:27:51.459
Right.
We're gonna need some backup.

434
00:27:53.293 --> 00:27:57.459
No way. That place is impenetrable.

435
00:27:57.459 --> 00:27:59.168
Yeah, and you can't get in neither.

436
00:28:01.293 --> 00:28:02.793
It's an impossible mission.

437
00:28:02.793 --> 00:28:05.959
Uh, shouldn't it be the other way around?

438
00:28:05.959 --> 00:28:08.793
Don't be a 'nana, Fetch.

439
00:28:09.293 --> 00:28:11.126
I know it looks
like a million-to-one shot,

440
00:28:11.126 --> 00:28:14.501
but we know the layout,
and Mac thinks there's a way in.

441
00:28:14.501 --> 00:28:16.959
This is Fun Land Farm.

442
00:28:16.959 --> 00:28:18.209
Oh!

443
00:28:18.209 --> 00:28:20.876
It's much smaller than I expected.

444
00:28:20.876 --> 00:28:23.043
Uh, thanks, Babs.

445
00:28:23.543 --> 00:28:27.293
There's a wee side door in a blind spot.

446
00:28:27.876 --> 00:28:29.876
With a cheeky wee trick to open it.

447
00:28:32.418 --> 00:28:35.418
So, only the small matter
of this electric fence.

448
00:28:35.418 --> 00:28:36.543
All these guards.

449
00:28:36.543 --> 00:28:38.793
The camera-driven gun-toting moles.

450
00:28:38.793 --> 00:28:41.959
And the laser-guided exploding ducks.

451
00:28:41.959 --> 00:28:45.626
Please. You've got to help us.
Rocky's in there.

452
00:28:45.626 --> 00:28:47.168
Ah, shame. I quite liked him.

453
00:28:47.168 --> 00:28:48.876
And so is Molly.

454
00:28:49.584 --> 00:28:51.584
Molly? Our little niece?

455
00:28:51.584 --> 00:28:52.876
Steady, mate.

456
00:28:52.876 --> 00:28:55.959
- Stay strong.

457
00:29:00.459 --> 00:29:03.543
- So you're in?
-  Just tell us what you need.

458
00:29:03.543 --> 00:29:07.501
- Anything for our little Molly!

459
00:29:09.043 --> 00:29:10.709
We can do this, everyone.

460
00:29:10.709 --> 00:29:15.126
Bunty, with your strength, my love,
we can move mountains.

461
00:29:15.126 --> 00:29:16.709
Mac, you're the brains.

462
00:29:17.709 --> 00:29:21.251
Babs, you're our... wool specialist.

463
00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:22.334
Ah.

464
00:29:22.334 --> 00:29:23.334
Nick and Fetch,

465
00:29:23.334 --> 00:29:26.543
you're the sneakiest little toerags
this side of the Dales.

466
00:29:26.543 --> 00:29:27.834
Oh.

467
00:29:27.834 --> 00:29:29.959
- You're too kind.
-  Flatterer.

468
00:29:29.959 --> 00:29:33.501
And, Fowler, with your wisdom
and vigilance...

469
00:29:33.501 --> 00:29:35.584
- Fowler?

470
00:29:38.501 --> 00:29:43.168
Ooh. [splutters] And then the second wave
of bombers approach the target,

471
00:29:43.168 --> 00:29:45.126
and that's where I come in.

472
00:29:46.168 --> 00:29:50.418
Actually, Fowler,
we need to find something special for you.

473
00:29:50.418 --> 00:29:52.834
- Ah, right.

474
00:29:53.334 --> 00:29:55.543
How about... getaway man?

475
00:29:55.543 --> 00:29:58.043
Getaway man, eh?

476
00:29:58.043 --> 00:30:01.293
Hmm. [clicks tongue] Sounds important.

477
00:30:01.793 --> 00:30:02.959
I like it.

478
00:30:02.959 --> 00:30:06.376
Right. Let's gather what we need
and hurry.

479
00:30:06.876 --> 00:30:09.501
Who knows what horrors
Molly is dealing with in there.

480
00:30:14.501 --> 00:30:16.251
Whoo-hoo!

481
00:30:16.251 --> 00:30:18.959
-  Wow!
- This place is fun!

482
00:30:20.376 --> 00:30:23.376
- It's the most amazin' place ever.

483
00:30:23.376 --> 00:30:25.376
And my mum said that's where <i>we</i> live.

484
00:30:25.376 --> 00:30:26.584
Yeah, right.

485
00:30:26.584 --> 00:30:29.418
Are the streets paved
with marshmallows where you live?

486
00:30:30.001 --> 00:30:31.834
Can ya bounce on them?

487
00:30:31.834 --> 00:30:35.168
- No! They're paved with dirt.

488
00:30:35.168 --> 00:30:38.418
- Can you lie around doin' nothin' all day?

489
00:30:38.418 --> 00:30:40.293
Actually, my dad can.

490
00:30:40.293 --> 00:30:43.626
Well, everyone can do that here.

491
00:30:43.626 --> 00:30:45.251
Wow.

492
00:30:46.001 --> 00:30:49.251
I've heard of this,
but I never knew it actually existed.

493
00:30:49.251 --> 00:30:51.209
Cool. What is it?

494
00:30:51.209 --> 00:30:53.834
All-you-can-eat buffet.

495
00:30:56.043 --> 00:30:58.459
-  Hey!

496
00:30:59.793 --> 00:31:02.334
Cooler than a penguin's toenails.

497
00:31:02.334 --> 00:31:04.168
- Right?

498
00:31:04.168 --> 00:31:05.459
Mm!

499
00:31:06.626 --> 00:31:07.959
- Whee!

500
00:31:10.418 --> 00:31:13.334
It's just, back home, I had jobs to do.

501
00:31:14.501 --> 00:31:18.001
I helped Mac with the harvester,
helped Bunty pick carrots,

502
00:31:18.584 --> 00:31:20.459
made yarn with Babs.

503
00:31:20.459 --> 00:31:22.543
But here, it's just play.

504
00:31:25.293 --> 00:31:27.209
And then more play.

505
00:31:29.168 --> 00:31:30.876
I wonder if they're missing me.

506
00:31:31.376 --> 00:31:34.334
It's great, innit?
We're free to do whatever we want.

507
00:31:35.043 --> 00:31:38.501
Whoo-hoo!

508
00:31:38.501 --> 00:31:41.084
Whoo!

509
00:31:41.084 --> 00:31:42.251
Come on!

510
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:45.084
Whee!

511
00:31:45.084 --> 00:31:46.584
Yay!

512
00:31:51.251 --> 00:31:53.043
Sorry.

513
00:31:53.043 --> 00:31:53.959
Hmm?

514
00:31:54.834 --> 00:31:56.959
-  Whee!

515
00:31:59.959 --> 00:32:01.584
-  Ooh!
-  Ah!

516
00:32:04.834 --> 00:32:06.834
-  Huh?

517
00:32:06.834 --> 00:32:08.043
-  Whee!

518
00:32:08.043 --> 00:32:09.209
Hmm?

519
00:32:13.334 --> 00:32:14.626
Ah.

520
00:32:23.918 --> 00:32:26.209
-  Oh! Uh-oh!

521
00:32:26.209 --> 00:32:28.168
Uh... Um...

522
00:32:28.168 --> 00:32:30.043
Uh... Frizzle!

523
00:32:31.293 --> 00:32:34.376
There's actually something strange
about this place.

524
00:32:34.376 --> 00:32:35.418
I'll say.

525
00:32:39.168 --> 00:32:41.668
Ever seen anything like this before?

526
00:32:52.918 --> 00:32:55.751
Oh no, what's this?

527
00:32:55.751 --> 00:32:59.334
You aren't supposed to be back there, number...

528
00:32:59.334 --> 00:33:02.876
Hmm.
You don't have a number?

529
00:33:05.959 --> 00:33:08.626
We don't want chickens
making any trouble here.

530
00:33:10.209 --> 00:33:13.584
- Especially not today.

531
00:33:44.626 --> 00:33:48.043
Okay, everyone. It's go time.

532
00:33:48.834 --> 00:33:52.084
It's all right. I went before we left.

533
00:34:14.834 --> 00:34:15.751
Hmm.

534
00:34:20.084 --> 00:34:21.168
Mm!

535
00:34:30.751 --> 00:34:32.293
What the... Huh?

536
00:34:36.126 --> 00:34:37.126
Huh?

537
00:34:48.501 --> 00:34:50.584
- Huh?

538
00:34:52.793 --> 00:34:53.918
Oh!

539
00:35:13.251 --> 00:35:14.084
Huh?

540
00:35:16.126 --> 00:35:18.001
No, you mug.

541
00:35:18.001 --> 00:35:19.501
It's upside down.

542
00:35:19.501 --> 00:35:21.293
Oh right.

543
00:35:26.126 --> 00:35:27.418
Mm.

544
00:35:40.126 --> 00:35:41.918
Go! Go! Go!

545
00:35:52.126 --> 00:35:53.376
- Yup?

546
00:36:08.918 --> 00:36:10.668
-  All clear.

547
00:36:34.168 --> 00:36:36.376
-  Ah.

548
00:36:43.584 --> 00:36:44.501
Let's go.

549
00:37:03.459 --> 00:37:04.793
-  Oh!

550
00:37:10.043 --> 00:37:13.459
Perfect landin'.
Right on the button.

551
00:37:13.459 --> 00:37:14.959
Right on the button?

552
00:37:14.959 --> 00:37:16.626
Mm. Okay.

553
00:37:21.084 --> 00:37:22.626
Let me out!

554
00:37:26.168 --> 00:37:27.168
The camera!

555
00:37:27.168 --> 00:37:29.084
I've got it.

556
00:37:32.043 --> 00:37:33.459
- Huh?

557
00:37:33.959 --> 00:37:35.209
Hmm?

558
00:38:17.334 --> 00:38:18.251
Mm.

559
00:38:19.084 --> 00:38:20.834
-  Huh?

560
00:38:34.334 --> 00:38:35.501
Huh?

561
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:38.251
-  Hmm?
-  Hmm.

562
00:38:41.251 --> 00:38:43.501
"Getaway man," she said.

563
00:38:45.459 --> 00:38:49.418
More like taxi driver
for a couple of rats.

564
00:38:50.334 --> 00:38:52.668
There. Textbook landing.

565
00:38:52.668 --> 00:38:53.793
Ah, oh.

566
00:38:54.459 --> 00:38:56.168
At ease, soldier.

567
00:38:57.043 --> 00:39:00.168
I reckon they think
I'm too old for this caper.

568
00:39:00.168 --> 00:39:03.626
Some rambling old rooster
who's easily distracted.

569
00:39:03.626 --> 00:39:09.834
Hm. Oh, actually,
there's quite an amusing story about that.

570
00:39:09.834 --> 00:39:12.959
One time, I <i>was</i> out rambling...

571
00:39:12.959 --> 00:39:15.084
Well, on maneuvers, and...

572
00:39:22.959 --> 00:39:24.084
All right.

573
00:39:24.584 --> 00:39:25.834
I'm inside.

574
00:39:25.834 --> 00:39:27.918
- Huh?

575
00:39:31.293 --> 00:39:33.043
Get off of me.

576
00:39:33.043 --> 00:39:34.709
Oh. Uh, ooh.

577
00:39:34.709 --> 00:39:40.668
Nick, uh, I don't wanna worry you,
but I think your bum just spoke.

578
00:39:40.668 --> 00:39:42.501
-  Huh?

579
00:39:43.334 --> 00:39:45.251
Guys? What are you doin' here?

580
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:47.626
Rocky!

581
00:39:47.626 --> 00:39:50.168
We're with Ginger.
Uh, we've come to rescue ya.

582
00:39:50.168 --> 00:39:52.126
Rescue <i>me</i>?

583
00:39:52.126 --> 00:39:54.418
No, no. I'm <i>doing</i> the rescuing.

584
00:39:54.418 --> 00:39:56.626
I'm not <i>being</i> rescued.

585
00:39:56.626 --> 00:39:58.751
I am rescuing Molly.

586
00:40:01.418 --> 00:40:02.626
How's that going, then?

587
00:40:03.293 --> 00:40:05.209
- Well...

588
00:40:05.209 --> 00:40:10.126
Look, don't take this the wrong way,
but you guys are just gonna hold me back.

589
00:40:10.626 --> 00:40:12.168
I tend to work alone.

590
00:40:12.168 --> 00:40:13.209
Oh, yeah?

591
00:40:13.793 --> 00:40:16.376
Yeah, the Lone Free Ranger.

592
00:40:16.376 --> 00:40:18.418
Right? And I am close.

593
00:40:18.418 --> 00:40:20.043
I can <i>feel</i> it.

594
00:40:20.043 --> 00:40:22.001
I'm gettin' warm, boys.

595
00:40:23.126 --> 00:40:24.918
<i>Really</i> warm, actually.

596
00:40:24.918 --> 00:40:28.001
-  Can anyone smell roast chicken?

597
00:40:35.709 --> 00:40:38.043
I said you'd hold me back!

598
00:40:43.626 --> 00:40:44.959
Whoa!

599
00:40:49.668 --> 00:40:51.126
-  Huh?

600
00:40:56.501 --> 00:40:57.709
Oh dear.

601
00:40:57.709 --> 00:41:00.126
We actually planned that.

602
00:41:00.126 --> 00:41:02.251
- Did we?

603
00:41:04.918 --> 00:41:07.293
Okay. I've gotta go find Molly.

604
00:41:07.293 --> 00:41:09.459
Molly?

605
00:41:09.459 --> 00:41:12.418
Hold it back, son. Hold it back.

606
00:41:15.251 --> 00:41:16.584
Ah.

607
00:41:17.543 --> 00:41:18.834
Look at them.

608
00:41:19.334 --> 00:41:22.751
- It's like they're all a bit... brainless.
-  Ah.

609
00:41:22.751 --> 00:41:26.709
Erm. I don't think I like it here.

610
00:41:26.709 --> 00:41:31.126
Yeah. It's not as much fun
as it looked on the poster, is it?

611
00:41:31.126 --> 00:41:33.084
Hey, Frizzle.

612
00:41:33.084 --> 00:41:36.293
Maybe we should try and find out
what's going on in this place.

613
00:41:36.876 --> 00:41:40.918
Now, <i>that</i> sounds like
a real adventure.

614
00:41:40.918 --> 00:41:41.876
Come on.

615
00:41:41.876 --> 00:41:43.876
Let's investigate.

616
00:42:07.918 --> 00:42:09.459
Ah!

617
00:42:10.584 --> 00:42:13.376
Come on, now,
you naughty little thing.

618
00:42:13.376 --> 00:42:17.334
I'm just your big chicken friend
who only wants you to be happy.

619
00:42:21.584 --> 00:42:23.543
Frizzle!

620
00:42:31.209 --> 00:42:32.709
What was that?

621
00:42:37.459 --> 00:42:39.126
Hello.

622
00:42:41.168 --> 00:42:42.251
Who are you?

623
00:42:42.834 --> 00:42:43.959
What?

624
00:42:43.959 --> 00:42:46.209
It's me. Molly.

625
00:42:47.459 --> 00:42:50.126
Happy to meet you.

626
00:42:50.126 --> 00:42:53.668
- Frizzle, what's this?

627
00:42:55.168 --> 00:42:56.251
Huh?

628
00:42:58.584 --> 00:43:00.084
Come on, Frizzle.

629
00:43:00.084 --> 00:43:01.918
We've got to go.

630
00:43:05.501 --> 00:43:09.084
But I've never been so happy.

631
00:43:09.084 --> 00:43:11.376
- Whee!

632
00:43:25.376 --> 00:43:26.293
No.

633
00:43:27.459 --> 00:43:28.709
I'm big...

634
00:43:32.168 --> 00:43:33.626
...and I'm brave.

635
00:43:34.126 --> 00:43:36.084
-  Frizzle.

636
00:43:36.084 --> 00:43:39.043
Listen. I'm going to find out
what's going on here.

637
00:43:39.043 --> 00:43:40.709
Then I will be back.

638
00:43:40.709 --> 00:43:42.334
I promise.

639
00:43:46.459 --> 00:43:47.459
Huh?

640
00:43:59.376 --> 00:44:00.501
Huh?

641
00:44:02.459 --> 00:44:04.376
Whoa.

642
00:44:17.543 --> 00:44:21.043
<i>Dr. Fry, your guest has arrived.</i>

643
00:44:21.626 --> 00:44:24.584
Sir Eat-a-Lot.

644
00:44:25.584 --> 00:44:26.584
Right.

645
00:44:26.584 --> 00:44:28.876
It's showtime.

646
00:44:37.334 --> 00:44:40.709
Ah, Sir Eat-a-Lot! Welcome.

647
00:44:40.709 --> 00:44:43.459
What an honor
to have a knight of the realm with us.

648
00:44:43.459 --> 00:44:46.293
Actually, Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant.

649
00:44:46.293 --> 00:44:48.459
My name is... Oh.

650
00:44:57.543 --> 00:44:58.501
Oh.

651
00:45:01.084 --> 00:45:03.209
Here at Fun Land Farms,

652
00:45:03.209 --> 00:45:08.251
we do everything we can
to make our chickens feel right at home.

653
00:45:10.418 --> 00:45:14.043
Well, I must say, I've never seen
a farm like this before, Dr. Fry.

654
00:45:14.543 --> 00:45:16.668
Is all this security really necessary?

655
00:45:16.668 --> 00:45:17.793
Oh yes.

656
00:45:17.793 --> 00:45:18.709
Molly.

657
00:45:18.709 --> 00:45:22.126
You see, behind these doors are secrets

658
00:45:22.126 --> 00:45:25.626
that will change
the world of poultry technology forever.

659
00:45:25.626 --> 00:45:26.751
Come on.

660
00:45:30.834 --> 00:45:32.418
No!

661
00:45:37.126 --> 00:45:39.209
Oi, what are you lot doing?

662
00:45:44.959 --> 00:45:47.501
-  Attack!

663
00:45:47.501 --> 00:45:49.668
This place is a maze.

664
00:45:50.168 --> 00:45:52.043
How am I ever gonna find Molly in here?

665
00:45:53.501 --> 00:45:55.251
- There she is.
-  Huh?

666
00:45:57.001 --> 00:45:58.168
Molly?

667
00:46:00.251 --> 00:46:02.418
Molly! Molly!

668
00:46:06.459 --> 00:46:09.501
And, um,
how's the restaurant business?

669
00:46:09.501 --> 00:46:11.209
Actually, a little slow.

670
00:46:12.584 --> 00:46:15.501
Oh well,
I think we can help you with that.

671
00:46:15.501 --> 00:46:17.584
Molly!

672
00:46:18.626 --> 00:46:20.251
No! No!

673
00:46:22.084 --> 00:46:24.459
Molly! Molly! Molly!

674
00:46:32.418 --> 00:46:34.209
Ah. Ginger?

675
00:46:38.959 --> 00:46:41.376
Right. I'm gone.

676
00:46:41.376 --> 00:46:43.168
Well, can't we just take the lift?

677
00:46:45.709 --> 00:46:48.584
All I can say, Dr. Fry,
is this had better be...

678
00:46:50.043 --> 00:46:51.418
good.

679
00:46:52.959 --> 00:46:57.584
My, uh, partner
will be joining us shortly.

680
00:46:58.126 --> 00:47:04.209
In the meantime, we've prepared
a little presentation.

681
00:47:04.209 --> 00:47:06.251
Please, be seated.

682
00:47:31.834 --> 00:47:34.459
<i>This is an ordinary chicken.</i>

683
00:47:34.459 --> 00:47:36.918
<i>Plain, dull, and easily frightened.</i>

684
00:47:38.376 --> 00:47:40.501
<i>Like any simpleminded creature,</i>

685
00:47:40.501 --> 00:47:43.001
<i>its natural instincts,
when faced with processing,</i>

686
00:47:43.001 --> 00:47:45.084
<i>is fear and panic.</i>

687
00:47:48.834 --> 00:47:51.584
<i>When this occurs,
the muscles tense,</i>

688
00:47:51.584 --> 00:47:55.168
<i>which cause the connective tissues
to form knots.</i>

689
00:47:56.334 --> 00:47:57.543
<i>The result?</i>

690
00:47:57.543 --> 00:48:01.626
<i>Meat that is tough, dry, and flavorless.</i>

691
00:48:03.126 --> 00:48:06.084
<i>Mummy, this meat is tough,
dry, and flavorless.</i>

692
00:48:06.084 --> 00:48:08.293
<i>- I hate you, Mummy.
- Oh!</i>

693
00:48:09.918 --> 00:48:10.751
Molly.

694
00:48:10.751 --> 00:48:13.251
<i>Fear not,
underappreciated mother.</i>

695
00:48:13.251 --> 00:48:16.251
<i>For what if science could change all that?</i>

696
00:48:16.251 --> 00:48:20.251
<i>For what if science could alter
a chicken's response to fear?</i>

697
00:48:22.793 --> 00:48:26.793
<i>What if it could make
a chicken happy to be processed?</i>

698
00:48:28.918 --> 00:48:31.751
<i>Then you'd say,
"Well done, science."</i>

699
00:48:34.334 --> 00:48:36.293
<i>Because a happy chicken</i>

700
00:48:36.876 --> 00:48:38.501
<i>is a tasty chicken.</i>

701
00:48:46.293 --> 00:48:49.418
<i>This is the most delicious chicken
in the whole wide world.</i>

702
00:48:49.418 --> 00:48:50.793
<i>I love you, Mummy.</i>

703
00:48:50.793 --> 00:48:52.459
<i>Thank you, science.</i>

704
00:48:55.543 --> 00:48:56.709
Molly.

705
00:48:58.334 --> 00:49:01.043
That's a clever little cartoon, Dr. Fry.

706
00:49:01.043 --> 00:49:02.751
But will you be able to do it?

707
00:49:02.751 --> 00:49:04.834
We already have.

708
00:49:04.834 --> 00:49:07.376
-  That voice.

709
00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:30.251
Allow me to introduce my wife.

710
00:49:31.751 --> 00:49:35.251
Melisha Tweedy.

711
00:49:37.834 --> 00:49:41.209
Welcome to the future.

712
00:49:45.168 --> 00:49:46.293
It's her.

713
00:49:48.834 --> 00:49:52.584
Darling, this is Sir Eat-a-Lot.

714
00:49:52.584 --> 00:49:54.376
The name is Reginald Smith.

715
00:49:54.376 --> 00:49:58.251
Sir Eat-a-Lot
is just the name of the restaurant chain.

716
00:50:00.334 --> 00:50:02.084
Hello, Reginald.

717
00:50:02.584 --> 00:50:06.709
I see you've met
my current husband, Dr. Fry.

718
00:50:07.543 --> 00:50:11.709
Was I attracted to his large inheritance
and vast acres of land?

719
00:50:12.209 --> 00:50:15.918
No, it was his mind.

720
00:50:15.918 --> 00:50:20.709
You probably can't tell
by looking at him, but he's a genius.

721
00:50:20.709 --> 00:50:22.418
You flatter me, darling.

722
00:50:22.418 --> 00:50:26.751
With degrees from Oxford
and Cambridge in clinical neurology,

723
00:50:26.751 --> 00:50:30.584
behavioral psychology,
genetic engineering...

724
00:50:30.584 --> 00:50:32.793
And drama!

725
00:50:37.126 --> 00:50:39.501
Now you've had the appetizer,

726
00:50:40.001 --> 00:50:42.376
time for the main course.

727
00:50:42.876 --> 00:50:43.709
Come.

728
00:50:48.834 --> 00:50:51.334
Molly, no. Get back.

729
00:50:51.834 --> 00:50:54.043
Let me go!

730
00:50:54.543 --> 00:50:56.751
Right. Try and find Molly.

731
00:50:56.751 --> 00:51:00.001
- Oh, look.

732
00:51:00.001 --> 00:51:02.793
Rocky and the rats are on telly.

733
00:51:02.793 --> 00:51:05.251
Looks like a real cliffhanger.

734
00:51:05.834 --> 00:51:07.001
- Where is she?

735
00:51:11.793 --> 00:51:12.793
Oh.

736
00:51:17.876 --> 00:51:19.251
Oh, look.

737
00:51:20.209 --> 00:51:22.709
They like the new egg cup ride.

738
00:51:27.751 --> 00:51:28.584
Frizzle.

739
00:51:29.834 --> 00:51:31.418
Mum?

740
00:51:31.418 --> 00:51:33.043
Oh, Mollypod.

741
00:51:33.043 --> 00:51:34.334
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

742
00:51:34.334 --> 00:51:36.043
Promise never to run away again.

743
00:51:36.043 --> 00:51:38.501
- Did they hurt you?
- I'm fine, but I think they eat...

744
00:51:38.501 --> 00:51:40.793
-  Come on. Get on with it.
- Shh.

745
00:51:40.793 --> 00:51:42.668
Right you are, pumpkin.

746
00:51:44.876 --> 00:51:46.751
Behold.

747
00:51:46.751 --> 00:51:50.251
The remote control.

748
00:51:50.793 --> 00:51:55.043
- And the other remote controls.

749
00:51:55.043 --> 00:51:56.668
Why three?

750
00:51:59.793 --> 00:52:01.876
- Nobody knows.

751
00:52:02.543 --> 00:52:04.876
Let's go with...

752
00:52:06.543 --> 00:52:07.584
that one.

753
00:52:07.584 --> 00:52:09.459
-  Huh?

754
00:52:09.459 --> 00:52:11.418
- Why am I playing golf?
- Where am I?

755
00:52:11.418 --> 00:52:14.584
- What am I doing?
- Molly? Where are you, Molly?

756
00:52:14.584 --> 00:52:16.376
What's going on?

757
00:52:16.376 --> 00:52:19.126
No, no, no.
Wrong one, my angel.

758
00:52:19.126 --> 00:52:21.334
- That's the off button.

759
00:52:21.334 --> 00:52:23.459
-  Ah!

760
00:52:25.501 --> 00:52:27.668
Allow me.

761
00:52:34.084 --> 00:52:37.251
-  It's me.

762
00:52:37.251 --> 00:52:39.584
Whoa!

763
00:52:39.584 --> 00:52:41.876
Ah!

764
00:52:43.668 --> 00:52:46.084
- Ooh!

765
00:52:46.668 --> 00:52:49.251
She's won the prize.

766
00:52:49.251 --> 00:52:51.459
Oh wow.

767
00:52:51.459 --> 00:52:54.209
What a lucky ducky!

768
00:53:01.043 --> 00:53:03.084
Ooh!

769
00:53:04.418 --> 00:53:06.376
No. Stop.

770
00:53:06.376 --> 00:53:08.751
-  Run, chicken! Run!

771
00:53:08.751 --> 00:53:10.376
Bye!

772
00:53:13.876 --> 00:53:16.876
Have a nice time!

773
00:53:22.959 --> 00:53:25.209
Look at me, and do not look away.

774
00:53:32.501 --> 00:53:33.793
Behold,

775
00:53:34.501 --> 00:53:37.584
the dawn of the nugget.

776
00:53:44.001 --> 00:53:45.876
Mm!

777
00:53:46.376 --> 00:53:48.668
I love you, Mummy.

778
00:53:49.334 --> 00:53:52.043
Um... Um, I... I... I mean, it's delicious.

779
00:53:52.626 --> 00:53:53.709
Picture it.

780
00:53:53.709 --> 00:53:56.626
- On every street, in every town.

781
00:53:56.626 --> 00:53:58.293
People on the go.

782
00:53:58.293 --> 00:54:01.168
Modern people in a modern world.

783
00:54:01.168 --> 00:54:04.084
They want their food,
and they want it fast.

784
00:54:04.084 --> 00:54:08.334
And we will give it to them
by the bucketful.

785
00:54:11.793 --> 00:54:13.668
Fast food.

786
00:54:13.668 --> 00:54:15.751
I like it. This could be big.

787
00:54:16.251 --> 00:54:18.959
No. It will be <i>huge</i>.

788
00:54:18.959 --> 00:54:22.709
And Melisha Tweedy will have her revenge.

789
00:54:27.001 --> 00:54:28.168
Revenge?

790
00:54:29.459 --> 00:54:32.168
Revenue. That's what I meant.

791
00:54:32.668 --> 00:54:36.876
I'll send a truck to collect
the first batch at dawn tomorrow.

792
00:54:37.376 --> 00:54:41.043
With my nuggets
and your chain of restaurants,

793
00:54:41.043 --> 00:54:45.084
this is going to be
a beautiful partnership.

794
00:54:45.084 --> 00:54:46.209
Ah.

795
00:54:48.876 --> 00:54:52.168
Uh, shall I see you to your car,
Your Sirness?

796
00:54:52.918 --> 00:54:53.876
Come on.

797
00:54:53.876 --> 00:54:55.168
Let's get out of here.

798
00:54:55.168 --> 00:54:57.584
No, wait. We can't go without Frizzle.

799
00:54:57.584 --> 00:55:00.168
Frizzle? Who's Frizzle?

800
00:55:00.168 --> 00:55:02.668
She's my friend. I can't just leave her.

801
00:55:02.668 --> 00:55:03.918
I promised I'd come back.

802
00:55:03.918 --> 00:55:06.209
Please, Molly. You don't understand.

803
00:55:06.209 --> 00:55:08.626
But you saw what happens. She'll die.

804
00:55:08.626 --> 00:55:11.751
And if we don't leave here now,
then we will die too.

805
00:55:11.751 --> 00:55:13.834
I don't care. I'm not leaving her here.

806
00:55:13.834 --> 00:55:15.043
You are just a child,

807
00:55:15.043 --> 00:55:17.209
and you have no idea
who you're dealing with.

808
00:55:18.918 --> 00:55:21.376
- Uh...

809
00:55:22.709 --> 00:55:23.626
- Bye-bye.

810
00:55:25.209 --> 00:55:26.418
You!

811
00:55:31.043 --> 00:55:32.709
- Huh?

812
00:55:34.501 --> 00:55:35.668
Come back here!

813
00:55:48.126 --> 00:55:51.959
Well now, the little escape artist.

814
00:55:52.543 --> 00:55:54.543
-  You won't ruin this.

815
00:55:54.543 --> 00:55:56.293
- Not again.

816
00:55:56.293 --> 00:55:58.501
- Come back immediately, Doctor.

817
00:55:58.501 --> 00:56:00.376
And bring a collar.

818
00:56:00.376 --> 00:56:03.376
- We've an unexpected guest.

819
00:56:07.459 --> 00:56:09.584
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

820
00:56:11.459 --> 00:56:12.543
Stop.

821
00:56:13.043 --> 00:56:15.168
You're pushin' us too hard, cuz.

822
00:56:15.168 --> 00:56:16.793
I ain't been this knackered

823
00:56:16.793 --> 00:56:20.168
since I took that hamster wheel
for a test-drive.

824
00:56:20.168 --> 00:56:22.459
-  Here she is.
- Shh. Listen.

825
00:56:22.459 --> 00:56:25.418
The miserable,
malcontented chicken

826
00:56:25.418 --> 00:56:27.626
that escaped Tweedy's Farm

827
00:56:27.626 --> 00:56:30.376
and ruined my life.

828
00:56:31.459 --> 00:56:34.293
What is this bloomin' place?

829
00:56:34.293 --> 00:56:36.876
- Molly, where are you?

830
00:56:47.126 --> 00:56:50.584
-  Ooh! He's laddered me knitting.

831
00:56:51.834 --> 00:56:52.876
Run!

832
00:56:56.293 --> 00:56:59.334
I gave you
all a hen could want.

833
00:56:59.334 --> 00:57:00.751
A warm hut,

834
00:57:00.751 --> 00:57:03.251
all the feed you could eat.

835
00:57:03.251 --> 00:57:06.959
- But you still weren't happy.

836
00:57:06.959 --> 00:57:09.959
- Well, I'm gonna make ya happy now.

837
00:57:17.168 --> 00:57:18.918
Mum.

838
00:57:20.084 --> 00:57:21.418
I've gotta get in there.

839
00:57:21.418 --> 00:57:23.584
Ah, I've got an idea.

840
00:57:23.584 --> 00:57:27.168
- You're the Lone Free Ranger, right?
- Yeah.

841
00:57:27.168 --> 00:57:29.751
You used to get shot
out of a cannon, right?

842
00:57:29.751 --> 00:57:31.626
That is all... Why?

843
00:57:31.626 --> 00:57:33.709
Huh? Ah?

844
00:57:35.543 --> 00:57:38.251
It's not working. Turn up the power.

845
00:57:38.251 --> 00:57:40.126
The equipment's in good order, my love.

846
00:57:40.126 --> 00:57:43.876
I've just never seen a chicken
so strong-willed.

847
00:57:44.918 --> 00:57:46.626
You don't know
the half of it.

848
00:57:46.626 --> 00:57:49.876
- Turn it up to full power.

849
00:57:49.876 --> 00:57:51.126
Full power?

850
00:57:51.126 --> 00:57:53.459
But we've never tested it
at that.

851
00:57:53.459 --> 00:57:56.501
- Must I do everything myself?

852
00:57:56.501 --> 00:58:00.459
Husbands and chickens,
the bane of my life.

853
00:58:18.334 --> 00:58:19.584
Huh?

854
00:58:22.876 --> 00:58:24.793
- Sure you can make this work?

855
00:58:24.793 --> 00:58:28.709
Oh yeah. There is nothing
Fetch don't know about electrics.

856
00:58:29.834 --> 00:58:32.668
He could chew through wiring
before he could walk.

857
00:58:33.168 --> 00:58:35.543
- Ready.
- Great work, boys.

858
00:58:35.543 --> 00:58:37.084
I'm ready to fly.

859
00:58:37.084 --> 00:58:38.709
Goodbye, cuz.

860
00:58:38.709 --> 00:58:40.834
Or should I say, "au revoir."

861
00:58:41.334 --> 00:58:43.876
It's more likely goodbye, to be honest.

862
00:58:48.584 --> 00:58:49.876
Hmm?

863
00:59:01.084 --> 00:59:02.501
Let's go.

864
00:59:06.293 --> 00:59:07.293
Come on, Mum.

865
00:59:07.293 --> 00:59:09.668
- Mum? Who's Mum?

866
00:59:09.668 --> 00:59:13.126
You are. And we have to get out of here.

867
00:59:13.126 --> 00:59:16.251
Why? I love it here.

868
00:59:16.251 --> 00:59:19.001
I'm so happy.

869
00:59:19.001 --> 00:59:20.876
No.

870
00:59:20.876 --> 00:59:23.251
Huh?

871
00:59:25.168 --> 00:59:27.418
Dad?

872
00:59:28.209 --> 00:59:29.043
Molly.

873
00:59:35.001 --> 00:59:35.959
Hmm.

874
00:59:37.668 --> 00:59:38.959
Right.

875
00:59:41.584 --> 00:59:43.834
Whoo!

876
00:59:45.834 --> 00:59:46.959
Huh?

877
00:59:51.293 --> 00:59:54.084
He's got some moves.

878
00:59:58.876 --> 01:00:01.251
Mum, wait.

879
01:00:02.126 --> 01:00:02.959
Ha!

880
01:00:02.959 --> 01:00:04.918
<i>♪ We can't fly, we are chickens! ♪</i>

881
01:00:04.918 --> 01:00:07.209
- Ow!

882
01:00:10.834 --> 01:00:11.668
Get him.

883
01:00:11.668 --> 01:00:13.251
<i>- </i>  Come here, you.
-  Oi!

884
01:00:17.084 --> 01:00:18.834
Hey! Get him.

885
01:00:20.668 --> 01:00:22.459
-  Ow!

886
01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:33.334
- Find those chickens!

887
01:00:35.376 --> 01:00:38.418
<i>♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y! ♪</i>

888

891
01:00:47.001 --> 01:00:49.751
- Come on!
- Shush, Mum. We have to be quiet.

892
01:00:49.751 --> 01:00:52.501
- But I want to sing!
- Shh!

893
01:00:52.501 --> 01:00:55.334
-  Just follow me.
- Oh, goody.

894
01:00:55.334 --> 01:00:57.168
- Are we going on holiday?

895
01:00:57.168 --> 01:01:00.834
No, we have to find Frizzle
and Dad and get out of here.

896
01:01:00.834 --> 01:01:03.334
But why?

897
01:01:04.043 --> 01:01:06.376
- Because I say so.

898
01:01:06.376 --> 01:01:09.418
Well, you're not the boss of me.

899
01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:12.626
- I can see my feet.

900
01:01:12.626 --> 01:01:13.793
Where'd they go?

901
01:01:13.793 --> 01:01:15.334
- Come on, Mum.
-  Come on!

902
01:01:15.334 --> 01:01:17.418
-  This way!
-  Cooee!

903
01:01:17.418 --> 01:01:18.418
Huh?

904
01:01:20.876 --> 01:01:21.751
Wait up!

905
01:01:21.751 --> 01:01:24.751
- Come on. Let's get a shimmy on.

906
01:01:30.334 --> 01:01:33.209
Ginger. Oh, thank heavens you escaped.

907
01:01:33.876 --> 01:01:36.501
I can't believe we're back up
against that horrible woman.

908
01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:39.793
What? Mrs. Tweedy's the best.

909
01:01:39.793 --> 01:01:41.418
- I love her.
-  Bunty.

910
01:01:41.418 --> 01:01:43.543
- Mac. It's this collar.
-  She's the loveliest.

911
01:01:43.543 --> 01:01:45.668
- It's making Mum act weird.
-  The bestest.

912
01:01:45.668 --> 01:01:47.834
-  Molly!

913
01:01:49.751 --> 01:01:52.084
-  Ooh!
- Cooee!

914
01:01:52.084 --> 01:01:53.709
-  Huh?

915
01:02:03.584 --> 01:02:06.043
- Ha. Got him.
- Uncle Nick?

916
01:02:06.043 --> 01:02:07.501
Uncle Fetch.

917
01:02:07.501 --> 01:02:09.334
How did you find us?

918
01:02:09.334 --> 01:02:12.209
- We just fell down the air vent.
- Love, Molly.

919
01:02:12.209 --> 01:02:13.418
Love showed us the way.

920
01:02:13.418 --> 01:02:15.209
-  Going up.

921
01:02:15.209 --> 01:02:17.918
-  Cooee!
-  Ginger!

922
01:02:17.918 --> 01:02:20.209
-  Mum!

923
01:02:23.459 --> 01:02:26.168
<i>- ♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪</i>

924
01:02:26.168 --> 01:02:27.543
<i>♪ I know I am ♪</i>

925
01:02:27.543 --> 01:02:29.501
<i>- ♪ I'm sure I am ♪</i>
- It won't budge.

926
01:02:29.501 --> 01:02:31.834
<i>- ♪ I'm H-A-P-P-Y ♪</i>
- Ooh. Babs, what's in your bag?

927
01:02:31.834 --> 01:02:33.918
Uh, not much, I'm afraid.

928
01:02:35.626 --> 01:02:36.668
Magic.

929
01:02:36.668 --> 01:02:37.918
The very dab.

930
01:02:39.459 --> 01:02:41.793
That tickles.

931
01:02:50.334 --> 01:02:51.459
Oh.

932
01:02:52.168 --> 01:02:55.793
It's like being
inside a giant biscuit tin.

933
01:02:56.376 --> 01:02:57.918
But without any biscuits.

934
01:02:57.918 --> 01:02:59.501
I've lost my specs.

935
01:02:59.501 --> 01:03:01.709
I cannae see a sausage.

936
01:03:02.376 --> 01:03:04.334
- Mum?

937
01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:06.001
Mum!

938
01:03:13.293 --> 01:03:14.334
Molly?

939
01:03:14.334 --> 01:03:16.418
You're okay.

940
01:03:17.209 --> 01:03:18.501
Oh, Molly.

941
01:03:20.168 --> 01:03:22.918
What happened? Where are we?

942
01:03:23.793 --> 01:03:26.334
Don't know, but there's no way out.

943
01:03:27.751 --> 01:03:29.584
There's never no way out.

944
01:03:30.959 --> 01:03:31.918
Where's Rocky?

945
01:03:31.918 --> 01:03:33.751
I saw him back in that big room.

946
01:03:33.751 --> 01:03:35.584
He saved us.

947
01:03:36.209 --> 01:03:37.459
He did?

948
01:03:45.168 --> 01:03:46.834
Huh?

949
01:03:47.668 --> 01:03:48.793
Oh!

950
01:03:48.793 --> 01:03:51.751
- Come on. We can do it this time.

951
01:03:51.751 --> 01:03:54.709
I can't hold this much longer.

952
01:03:54.709 --> 01:03:56.543
Fetcher, quickly!

953
01:03:56.543 --> 01:03:59.084
Find a ledge or a crack to grab hold of!

954
01:03:59.084 --> 01:04:00.126
Righto.

955
01:04:00.709 --> 01:04:02.543
Ooh! Not that crack.

956
01:04:03.918 --> 01:04:05.918
- Oh!

957
01:04:08.709 --> 01:04:11.793
Face the facts, duck.

958
01:04:12.293 --> 01:04:14.334
We need a miracle to get out of here.

959
01:04:14.334 --> 01:04:16.876
-  Hey! Anyone down there?

960
01:04:16.876 --> 01:04:18.084
-  Dad!
-  Rocky!

961
01:04:18.084 --> 01:04:22.084
Do not tell him he's our miracle.
There'll be no living with him.

962
01:04:22.084 --> 01:04:24.209
Rocky is on the case.

963
01:04:24.209 --> 01:04:26.543
No! Don't jump!

964
01:04:26.543 --> 01:04:28.459
- What? What's that?

965
01:04:28.459 --> 01:04:31.251
I can't hear you! Wait. I'm comin' down!

966
01:04:31.251 --> 01:04:32.501
Don't jump!

967
01:04:38.418 --> 01:04:40.751
- Oh! Family hug!

968
01:04:40.751 --> 01:04:42.668
Oh, I missed you guys.

969
01:04:42.668 --> 01:04:46.584
Okay. Well, let's blow this henhouse
and head home.

970
01:04:52.459 --> 01:04:53.418
Ah.

971
01:04:54.751 --> 01:04:56.334
That's the way out, isn't it?

972
01:04:59.543 --> 01:05:01.168
I am so sorry.

973
01:05:10.084 --> 01:05:12.626
Molly, what's wrong?

974
01:05:12.626 --> 01:05:14.376
This is all my fault.

975
01:05:14.876 --> 01:05:18.709
I should have listened to you
and done what I was told.

976
01:05:18.709 --> 01:05:21.001
Now everything is a mess.

977
01:05:24.876 --> 01:05:29.251
Hey, where's my big, brave girl?

978
01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:31.834
That girl's stupid.

979
01:05:32.751 --> 01:05:34.043
You were right.

980
01:05:34.043 --> 01:05:38.751
If we ever get home, I'll just stay there
and never leave. Ever.

981
01:05:39.251 --> 01:05:40.959
Hey, no. Molly.

982
01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:42.834
This is my fault.

983
01:05:43.334 --> 01:05:49.001
I should not have told you all
of that ridiculous Lone Free Ranger stuff.

984
01:05:50.501 --> 01:05:52.959
No, this is on me.

985
01:05:54.126 --> 01:05:55.959
I used to hate being fenced in.

986
01:05:56.668 --> 01:05:59.126
So why did I expect you
to be any different?

987
01:06:00.376 --> 01:06:02.918
I guess I was afraid
you were so much like me.

988
01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.376
What's wrong with being like you?

989
01:06:12.001 --> 01:06:13.043
Nothing.

990
01:06:13.043 --> 01:06:15.876
- Because your mom is the best.

991
01:06:16.376 --> 01:06:19.126
And she always has a plan.

992
01:06:20.793 --> 01:06:22.084
Not this time.

993
01:06:23.793 --> 01:06:25.626
He's here.

994
01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:29.751
- Are we ready to fry, Fry?

995
01:06:29.751 --> 01:06:31.418
Five minutes, pumpkin.

996
01:06:31.418 --> 01:06:33.584
- Make it four.
-  Oh.

997
01:06:33.584 --> 01:06:35.293
Where is she?

998
01:06:35.293 --> 01:06:36.626
- Hmm?

999
01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:41.126
Them runaway chickens, uh,
have got themselves stuck in a corn silo.

1000
01:06:41.751 --> 01:06:43.751
In the silo, you say?

1001
01:06:44.251 --> 01:06:47.209
Excellent. I'll go and greet our guest.

1002
01:06:47.209 --> 01:06:49.459
Production starts in three minutes.

1003
01:06:49.459 --> 01:06:50.918
Three?

1004
01:06:50.918 --> 01:06:55.084
Looks like you've just run out of cluck,
little chickens.

1005
01:07:03.001 --> 01:07:04.251
Huh?

1006
01:07:04.251 --> 01:07:05.168
Huh?

1007
01:07:05.834 --> 01:07:06.793
Huh?

1008
01:07:11.251 --> 01:07:13.709
I think there's a grinder
at the bottom of this thing.

1009
01:07:13.709 --> 01:07:16.668
On the plus side, though,
we will all probably drown

1010
01:07:16.668 --> 01:07:18.709
before we're ground into tiny, wee pieces.

1011
01:07:18.709 --> 01:07:20.543
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

1012
01:07:20.543 --> 01:07:22.376
Popcorn.

1013
01:07:22.376 --> 01:07:25.251
Popcorn, everyone. Look.
Look, popcorn.

1014
01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:28.293
Rocky, I don't think this is the time to...

1015
01:07:30.668 --> 01:07:32.001
Ah.

1016
01:07:33.793 --> 01:07:36.626
The answer to all life's problems.

1017
01:07:36.626 --> 01:07:37.751
Of course.

1018
01:07:37.751 --> 01:07:39.959
Mac, we need heat.

1019
01:07:39.959 --> 01:07:41.668
- Lots of it.
-  Oh.

1020
01:07:42.418 --> 01:07:43.876
Will this work?

1021
01:07:43.876 --> 01:07:45.751
Perfect.

1022
01:07:46.584 --> 01:07:48.584
Now, does anyone have a match?

1023
01:07:48.584 --> 01:07:51.043
Yeah, you and a raving lunatic.

1024
01:07:51.043 --> 01:07:53.334
- You'll blow us all to bits.

1025
01:07:56.584 --> 01:07:59.501
Besides, we've used the last one.

1026
01:08:00.918 --> 01:08:02.418
Oh no.

1027
01:08:11.168 --> 01:08:13.418
That's my girl.

1028
01:08:15.959 --> 01:08:20.084
Um, can I once again raise
my health and safety concerns?

1029
01:08:20.668 --> 01:08:21.501
What is it?

1030
01:08:23.501 --> 01:08:25.668
-  Huh?

1031
01:08:29.001 --> 01:08:30.043
All right.

1032
01:08:33.126 --> 01:08:34.084
Oh!

1033
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:38.584
Mm. That tastes nice.

1034
01:08:38.584 --> 01:08:40.001
Is there any more?

1035
01:08:50.876 --> 01:08:52.168
But guess what?

1036
01:08:52.168 --> 01:08:55.959
Just as Whizzbang Charlie
thought we were back in Blighty,

1037
01:08:55.959 --> 01:08:58.334
enemy fire at six o'clock.

1038
01:08:58.334 --> 01:09:01.834
- Ye gods. It's raining popcorn?

1039
01:09:01.834 --> 01:09:03.834
Good old British weather.

1040
01:09:03.834 --> 01:09:05.001
Unpredictable.

1041
01:09:05.001 --> 01:09:06.501
You never know what's coming.

1042
01:09:09.126 --> 01:09:11.043
Outrageous.

1043
01:09:19.334 --> 01:09:20.793
-  Hmm?

1044
01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:24.168
- Get in there!
- We made it.

1045
01:09:24.168 --> 01:09:25.918
- Look.
-  Whoo-hoo!

1046
01:09:25.918 --> 01:09:29.793
Fowler's only gone
and set up our escape route.

1047
01:09:30.334 --> 01:09:34.418
- Well done, you old sausage.

1048
01:09:34.418 --> 01:09:36.834
Firm handshake will do, thank you.

1049
01:09:36.834 --> 01:09:41.751
Mission accomplished.
Now let's fly this crazy coop, huh?

1050
01:09:42.251 --> 01:09:43.251
Oh yes.

1051
01:09:45.459 --> 01:09:46.709
Oh, look, Nick.

1052
01:09:47.626 --> 01:09:49.376
Have we got snacks for the way home?

1053
01:10:03.584 --> 01:10:05.293
All right. On you go.

1054
01:10:09.501 --> 01:10:10.876
Mm.

1055
01:10:13.293 --> 01:10:15.293
Ginger, are you coming?

1056
01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:18.418
No, I'm not.

1057
01:10:20.209 --> 01:10:21.334
I'm going back.

1058
01:10:25.209 --> 01:10:26.376
For Frizzle?

1059
01:10:28.043 --> 01:10:31.293
For Frizzle and all the chickens.

1060
01:10:33.793 --> 01:10:35.834
- Yes!

1061
01:10:38.918 --> 01:10:44.418
Just because where we live is cut off
from the world doesn't mean we are too.

1062
01:10:47.876 --> 01:10:49.876
No chicken is an island.

1063
01:10:52.209 --> 01:10:53.334
Hmm.

1064
01:10:53.334 --> 01:10:55.209
We are with you, Ginger.

1065
01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:57.168
Aye, me too.

1066
01:10:57.168 --> 01:10:58.626
Me four.

1067
01:10:58.626 --> 01:10:59.751
The rats are in.

1068
01:11:01.084 --> 01:11:02.876
Right. What's the plan, Mum?

1069
01:11:03.751 --> 01:11:08.584
Oh, well, I didn't think you...

1070
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:10.626
Rocky.

1071
01:11:11.126 --> 01:11:15.793
Hey, Molly, um,
are you sure you're ready for this?

1072
01:11:15.793 --> 01:11:18.168
- I was hatched ready, Dad.

1073
01:11:20.043 --> 01:11:21.709
She is a lot like me.

1074
01:11:32.418 --> 01:11:33.709
- Dr. Fry!

1075
01:11:33.709 --> 01:11:35.793
What was that noise up on the roof?

1076
01:11:35.793 --> 01:11:38.084
- Sounded like an explosion.

1077
01:11:38.084 --> 01:11:41.959
{\an8} Looks like one of the silos
has blown its top.

1078
01:11:41.959 --> 01:11:43.501
{\an8}- Oh.

1079
01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:45.501
Maybe you shouldn't have put
those chickens

1080
01:11:45.501 --> 01:11:47.543
through the grinder, my love.

1081
01:11:47.543 --> 01:11:49.251
Don't be ridiculous.

1082
01:11:49.251 --> 01:11:51.959
Melisha,
all ready for the big day?

1083
01:11:54.501 --> 01:11:56.376
Oh yes, Reginald.

1084
01:11:56.376 --> 01:11:58.251
Everything is tickety-boo.

1085
01:11:58.251 --> 01:12:01.084
Jolly good.
My truck is ready to go.

1086
01:12:01.084 --> 01:12:02.918
We've got to move fast.

1087
01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.209
While Tweedy is busy
with her guest outside,

1088
01:12:05.209 --> 01:12:07.293
<i>we sneak back in.</i>

1089
01:12:07.293 --> 01:12:10.959
<i>Molly, you take Bunty, Babs and Mac
to where all the chickens are.</i>

1090
01:12:10.959 --> 01:12:12.126
Come on.

1091
01:12:12.626 --> 01:12:14.418
- This way.
-  Ah.

1092
01:12:14.418 --> 01:12:16.168
<i>Stay out of sight</i>

1093
01:12:16.168 --> 01:12:19.709
<i>and get ready to stop
the chickens going up that staircase.</i>

1094
01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:22.876
<i>Rocky, we've got
to get hold of that button</i>.

1095
01:12:22.876 --> 01:12:25.251
-  <i>And disable those collars.</i>

1096
01:12:26.293 --> 01:12:28.168
<i>As soon as the collars are off,</i>

1097
01:12:28.168 --> 01:12:31.126
<i>Molly's team leads the chickens
out of there.</i>

1098
01:12:31.793 --> 01:12:34.251
<i>- We bust our way out.</i>

1099
01:12:34.834 --> 01:12:36.251
<i>Steal the truck,</i>

1100
01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:38.001
then we're home free.

1101
01:12:38.501 --> 01:12:40.251
Well, what are we waiting for?

1102
01:12:40.251 --> 01:12:43.418
- All right. Let's do this.
- We're doing it today, are we?

1103
01:12:44.168 --> 01:12:46.334
So where was I? Ah, yes.

1104
01:12:46.334 --> 01:12:48.709
Whizzbang Charlie had lost
his undercarriage,

1105
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:51.501
and the old crate was catching fire...

1106
01:12:53.501 --> 01:12:57.626
Actually, Melisha,
I have a little something for our big day.

1107
01:12:58.418 --> 01:13:02.543
Why, Reginald,
this is all very sudden.

1108
01:13:03.043 --> 01:13:05.001
- Uh...

1109
01:13:05.001 --> 01:13:06.084
Ketchup?

1110
01:13:06.084 --> 01:13:07.626
Oh. No, no.

1111
01:13:07.626 --> 01:13:09.709
Something completely new.

1112
01:13:10.209 --> 01:13:12.876
I call it "the dip."

1113
01:13:17.001 --> 01:13:19.709
It's... sweet.

1114
01:13:19.709 --> 01:13:22.168
And sour.

1115
01:13:22.168 --> 01:13:25.084
Aren't we all, Reginald?

1116
01:13:25.084 --> 01:13:26.751
-  <i>Dr. Fry?</i>

1117
01:13:29.501 --> 01:13:31.084
Yes, my beloved?

1118
01:13:31.084 --> 01:13:33.751
Say those words I am longing to hear.

1119
01:13:33.751 --> 01:13:36.043
<i>Get on with it, you idiot.</i>

1120
01:13:37.126 --> 01:13:38.834
Ooh.

1121
01:13:49.876 --> 01:13:53.626
It's the funky chicken
and the ginger one too.

1122
01:13:53.626 --> 01:13:57.376
Oh no, my wife
will not be happy with this.

1123
01:13:57.876 --> 01:14:03.293
Come on here now,
you naughty little chickens!

1124
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:14.709
Oh dear.

1125
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:18.501
See you on the flip side, egghead.
You get it?

1126
01:14:18.501 --> 01:14:21.626
<i>Dr. Fry? What's going on up there?</i>

1127
01:14:21.626 --> 01:14:22.751
Quick. Come on.

1128
01:14:23.334 --> 01:14:26.084
-  <i>Dr. Fry! Dr. Fry!</i>

1129
01:14:26.084 --> 01:14:27.876
-  Hello?
<i>- Dr. Fry!</i>

1130
01:14:27.876 --> 01:14:29.918
-  Anybody there?
<i>- Dr. Fry!</i>

1131
01:14:29.918 --> 01:14:31.918
- Dr. Fry!

1132
01:14:31.918 --> 01:14:33.376
Where are my nuggets?

1133
01:14:33.376 --> 01:14:37.959
Honestly, that man is about
as much use as a headless...

1134
01:14:41.834 --> 01:14:43.334
Chicken!

1135
01:14:48.334 --> 01:14:49.251
Ha ha!

1136
01:14:49.251 --> 01:14:50.251
Huh?

1137
01:14:55.043 --> 01:14:55.918
Huh?

1138
01:14:59.543 --> 01:15:02.418
Let's make some nuggets.

1139
01:15:02.418 --> 01:15:03.668
Oh no.

1140
01:15:05.584 --> 01:15:08.543
-  Huh?

1141
01:15:12.668 --> 01:15:14.584
Ah!

1142
01:15:14.584 --> 01:15:16.751
No. This is not good, Mac.

1143
01:15:21.959 --> 01:15:25.584
- Oh, Frizzle. Where are you?
-  Ooh!

1144
01:15:25.584 --> 01:15:28.626
My turn. Bye-bye.

1145
01:15:29.126 --> 01:15:30.584
Frizzle!

1146
01:15:31.376 --> 01:15:34.293
- Lovely sunshine.

1147
01:15:34.293 --> 01:15:36.501
- No, wait.
- Hold on to her.

1148
01:15:38.126 --> 01:15:40.501
<i>♪ We're goin' where the sea is blue ♪</i>

1149
01:15:40.501 --> 01:15:41.543
Mac, hurry.

1150
01:15:41.543 --> 01:15:45.418
-  Ooh!
<i>- ♪ We've seen it in the movies... ♪</i>

1151
01:15:48.876 --> 01:15:50.709
I got it. I got it.

1152
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:53.376
-  I don't got it!

1153
01:15:54.043 --> 01:15:54.876
Rocky.

1154
01:16:03.793 --> 01:16:04.668
Huh?

1155
01:16:04.668 --> 01:16:07.376
<i>- ♪ For me and you ♪</i>

1156
01:16:08.751 --> 01:16:10.751
Go, Ginger!

1157
01:16:17.126 --> 01:16:21.334
<i>♪ We're all goin' on a summer holiday ♪</i>

1158
01:16:21.334 --> 01:16:23.584
<i>- ♪ No more workin' for a week or two... ♪</i>

1159
01:16:23.584 --> 01:16:26.834
Come on, everybody.
We're goin' on holiday.

1160
01:16:26.834 --> 01:16:28.293
No, Babs.

1161
01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:31.001
They're going to turn everyone
into nuggets.

1162
01:16:32.376 --> 01:16:34.793
<i>♪ For a week or two ♪</i>

1163
01:16:35.459 --> 01:16:38.501
<i>♪ We're going

1164
01:16:38.501 --> 01:16:40.501

<i>♪ Where the sea is blue ♪</i>

1166
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:44.418
<i>♪ We've seen it in the movies ♪</i>

1167
01:16:44.418 --> 01:16:45.793
Please, Mac. Hurry.

1168
01:16:45.793 --> 01:16:46.918
Nearly done.

1169
01:16:46.918 --> 01:16:50.584
- Just one more bit of jiggerypokery, and...

1170
01:16:52.376 --> 01:16:55.959
What happened? What's goin' on?

1171
01:16:55.959 --> 01:16:58.126
Frizzle, this isn't the best place ever.

1172
01:16:58.126 --> 01:16:59.293
You only get your own bucket

1173
01:16:59.293 --> 01:17:01.459
when they've chopped you up
and cooked you.

1174
01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:07.293
And you came back for me?

1175
01:17:07.293 --> 01:17:08.876
Of course.

1176
01:17:09.376 --> 01:17:12.293
It's me and you, kidda. All the way.

1177
01:17:12.293 --> 01:17:15.876
-  Time to go!

1178
01:17:18.793 --> 01:17:22.001
Try to push them back!

1179
01:17:23.584 --> 01:17:25.668
-  There's too many!
-  Ooh!

1180
01:17:25.668 --> 01:17:28.376
Is this one of the activities?

1181
01:17:36.668 --> 01:17:38.501
-  Ah!

1182
01:17:38.501 --> 01:17:41.751
-  Ooh!

1183
01:17:45.543 --> 01:17:47.918
-  Huh?

1184
01:17:47.918 --> 01:17:49.959
Whee!

1185
01:17:49.959 --> 01:17:52.709
-  Whee!
-  Whee!

1186
01:17:59.334 --> 01:18:00.584
Mum!

1187
01:18:07.793 --> 01:18:09.168
Ginger!

1188
01:18:11.001 --> 01:18:12.626
Whoo!

1189
01:18:16.959 --> 01:18:20.293
Look. There's all the buckets!

1190
01:18:21.918 --> 01:18:23.918
-  The button!

1191
01:18:25.918 --> 01:18:27.001
That's it.

1192
01:18:27.001 --> 01:18:29.459
Frizzle, get on Bunty's shoulders.

1193
01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:30.459
What?

1194
01:18:31.209 --> 01:18:32.418
Trust me.

1195
01:18:32.418 --> 01:18:35.084
-  Up ya get.

1196
01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:43.876
- Good goin', Molly.

1197
01:18:43.876 --> 01:18:45.126
Good job, Molly!

1198
01:18:53.501 --> 01:18:54.376
Huh?

1199
01:18:57.793 --> 01:18:58.626
Ah.

1200
01:19:04.918 --> 01:19:06.001
-  Molly?

1201
01:19:06.751 --> 01:19:08.584
I got this, Dad. Help Mum.

1202
01:19:12.501 --> 01:19:13.543
Uh...

1203
01:19:21.751 --> 01:19:22.668
Molly, watch out.

1204
01:19:23.293 --> 01:19:24.418
Huh?

1205
01:19:24.418 --> 01:19:25.668
Ha!

1206
01:19:29.709 --> 01:19:32.293
What have we here?

1207
01:19:32.293 --> 01:19:35.834
- A little you.
-  Mum, catch.

1208
01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:41.001
- They're going over, Mum!

1209
01:19:46.668 --> 01:19:48.709
Ginger, we can't hold them!

1210
01:19:52.043 --> 01:19:53.334
Uh...

1211
01:19:53.334 --> 01:19:55.626
-  Uh-uh-uh!

1212
01:19:55.626 --> 01:19:59.168
{\an8}- You can't wait, Mum. Do it now!

1213
01:20:09.584 --> 01:20:10.918
Sometimes...

1214
01:20:13.043 --> 01:20:14.709
you've just got to take a leap.

1215
01:20:20.084 --> 01:20:21.168
No!

1216
01:20:21.168 --> 01:20:24.876
-  Cock-a-doodle-doo!
-  Huh?

1217
01:20:29.459 --> 01:20:31.209
- Huh?
- Ah!

1218
01:20:37.209 --> 01:20:39.376
No! No! No!

1219
01:20:45.501 --> 01:20:48.334
-  Oh!

1220
01:20:48.334 --> 01:20:49.459
Ginger!

1221
01:20:55.584 --> 01:20:57.084
- Ah.

1222
01:20:57.084 --> 01:20:59.459
I got ya. I got ya.

1223
01:20:59.459 --> 01:21:01.459
-  Well, now.

1224
01:21:02.501 --> 01:21:07.126
I suppose you three
might make a bucketful.

1225
01:21:12.543 --> 01:21:13.709
Hmm?

1226
01:21:14.293 --> 01:21:15.668
Bye-bye.

1227
01:21:15.668 --> 01:21:16.876
Again.

1228
01:21:16.876 --> 01:21:18.418
- Huh?

1229
01:21:40.209 --> 01:21:41.209
Come on.

1230
01:21:41.834 --> 01:21:44.501
- Ugh. What's taking so long?

1231
01:21:44.501 --> 01:21:46.751
So much for fast food.

1232
01:21:46.751 --> 01:21:48.584
- Hmm.

1233
01:21:49.876 --> 01:21:51.251
- Ah.

1234
01:21:51.251 --> 01:21:53.334
That's funny. Sounds like a...

1235
01:21:53.334 --> 01:21:55.418
-  ...stampede!

1236
01:21:55.418 --> 01:21:57.626
- Get your skates on.
- Move your tail feathers.

1237
01:21:57.626 --> 01:21:59.209
-  Come on.
-  Come on!

1238
01:22:01.751 --> 01:22:04.001
You sure you know how this works?

1239
01:22:04.001 --> 01:22:05.251
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1240
01:22:05.251 --> 01:22:07.834
Go, stop, and a spare one?

1241
01:22:07.834 --> 01:22:09.584
Come on! We have to go!

1242
01:22:09.584 --> 01:22:11.001
Full speed ahead!

1243
01:22:13.501 --> 01:22:14.626
Wrong way!

1244
01:22:14.626 --> 01:22:16.001
What gear are you in?

1245
01:22:16.001 --> 01:22:18.001
Oh, I call this "smart casual."

1246
01:22:25.293 --> 01:22:28.001
-  Ah, you there!

1247
01:22:28.001 --> 01:22:32.209
- What kind of crazy henhouse is this?

1248
01:22:32.209 --> 01:22:33.751
- Oh.

1249
01:22:33.751 --> 01:22:35.501
Melisha?

1250
01:22:36.001 --> 01:22:38.293
Why are you dressed like a nugget?

1251
01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:46.209
There's the exit!

1252
01:22:51.584 --> 01:22:54.043
- Get her off!

1253
01:22:56.751 --> 01:22:59.126
- Hmm?

1254
01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:10.751
I think they're gonna need
a bigger bucket.

1255
01:23:16.584 --> 01:23:23.126
-  Chocks away!
- Huh?

1256
01:23:23.126 --> 01:23:25.084
-  Ha ha!

1257
01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:45.501
T.I. Fowler, Getaway Division.

1258
01:23:45.501 --> 01:23:47.251
Reporting for duty.

1259
01:23:47.251 --> 01:23:49.751
{\an8}Where would we be without you, Fowler?

1260
01:23:51.376 --> 01:23:53.543
Darling! Darling!

1261
01:23:54.834 --> 01:23:57.209
- Blech.
-  Darling!

1262
01:23:57.209 --> 01:23:59.959
The processor is dangerously overheating.

1263
01:23:59.959 --> 01:24:01.543
Oh.

1264
01:24:01.543 --> 01:24:04.334
-  Huh?

1265
01:24:07.876 --> 01:24:08.876
Uh...

1266
01:24:08.876 --> 01:24:11.501
Pumpkin, watch out for the, uh...

1267
01:24:20.751 --> 01:24:22.584
-  Oh blast!
-  What?

1268
01:24:22.584 --> 01:24:24.959
I think I left my umbrella
in there.

1269
01:24:51.293 --> 01:24:56.918
Oh! The best thing about going on holiday
is getting back home, isn't it?

1270
01:24:56.918 --> 01:25:00.584
Yes, it is. Isn't it, Babs?

1271
01:25:00.584 --> 01:25:02.459
- Ooh!

1272
01:25:02.459 --> 01:25:03.709
-  Oh!
- All fixed.

1273
01:25:03.709 --> 01:25:05.418
- Just had a screw loose.

1274
01:25:10.959 --> 01:25:14.668
Good to have a bucket or two handy
in case you're feeling peckish.

1275
01:25:14.668 --> 01:25:16.501
Plenty for everyone.

1276
01:25:17.376 --> 01:25:19.668
This makes you happy
and brainless, apparently.

1277
01:25:19.668 --> 01:25:21.834
Oh yeah, I feel it.

1278
01:25:21.834 --> 01:25:24.751
It's amazin'.

1279
01:25:24.751 --> 01:25:27.293
Mate, I haven't turned it on yet.

1280
01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:34.501
Well, it looks like we've finally got
our happy ending.

1281
01:25:34.501 --> 01:25:37.876
Ah, let's just call this
our happy beginning.

1282
01:25:44.209 --> 01:25:46.918
Sergeant Molly,
reporting from reconnaissance.

1283
01:25:46.918 --> 01:25:48.918
Chicken farm, beyond the north field.

1284
01:25:48.918 --> 01:25:51.084
Thirty birds to a cage.

1285
01:25:51.084 --> 01:25:52.751
Poor little kiddas.

1286
01:25:56.084 --> 01:25:57.293
Right, everyone.

1287
01:26:02.084 --> 01:26:04.084
I don't like this one bit.

1288
01:26:04.084 --> 01:26:06.126
It's go time.

1289
01:26:07.001 --> 01:26:08.543
I've just got one question.

1290
01:26:09.043 --> 01:26:10.751
Is crowing back on the agenda?

1291
01:26:10.751 --> 01:26:12.334
Oh, definitely.

1292
01:26:12.834 --> 01:26:13.918
Ready, everyone?

01:26:14.418 --> 01:26:16.584
