WEBVTT

2
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.279
They told me you are the man.

3
00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.599
They said that this guy
can move anything.

4
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.759
They said that?

5
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.919
Yeah.

6
00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.426
I am the man.

7
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.104
USA passport.

8
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.639
The most valuable piece of paper

9
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.399
in the world and we
make it our own.

10
00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.065
That shit's artisanal.

11
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.422
I'll be the judge of that.

12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.741
Not bad.

13
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.625
What about Omar?
The friendly ghost?

14
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.879
He ain't gonna cut your
head off for this?

15
00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.319
I know he owns the city.

16
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.039
Omar signed off personally.

17
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.306
I don't know who you think you're
bullshitting, but it ain't me.

18
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.545
Calling me a liar?

19
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.063
With guns on your face?

20
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.989
You crazy you don't trust me.

21
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.389
Let me explain something to you.

22
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.759
There's not a lot in
this world that I love,

23
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.031
but the shit that I love,
I don't trust with nobody.

24
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.985
I'll buy 50 now

25
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.519
and 500 after Omar
looks me in my eye

26
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.119
and lets me know he's not going
to kill me over this deal.

27
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.502
Is that something you can arrange?

28
00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.989
Or is it more bullshit?

29
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.919
You're crazy, bro.

30
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.029
Yeah, I am crazy,

31
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.150
but in a good way.

32
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.986
Shit!

33
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.942
Everybody down! Atlanta PD!

34
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.439
There!

35
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.151
Shit!

36
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.186
Freeze!

37
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.119
Freeze! I said freeze!

38
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.319
Atlanta PD!

39
00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.190
Get down!

40
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.428
See you, bitches!

41
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.505
Freeze!

42
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.309
Atlanta PD! Get me another car!

43
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.031
A Prius? Get this
bullshit out of here!

44
00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.421
Damn!

45
00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.959
Valet. Get out.

46
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.944
Get out! Yeah!

47
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.386
Asshole!

48
00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.380
Move, trick!

49
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.901
Get out the way!

50
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.270
Here we go.

51
00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.226
Hey!

52
00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.389
Whoo!

53
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.266
Oh, shit!

54
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.790
How you like me now?

55
00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.546
Stop! Stop!

56
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.701
Oh, shit!

57
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.581
Yeah, baby!

58
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.351
I got you.

59
00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:50.061
Yeah!

60
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.546
I tried to be nice.

61
00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.747
You thought I was crazy?
No, baby, I'm nuts.

62
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.868
<i>Does anybody have a
twenty on Black Hammer?</i>

63
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.439
All right, let's get these bitches!

64
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.079
The target's on the second
floor. Let's switch it up.

65
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.959
Assface, me and you,
we'll go around back.

66
00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.399
<i>Copy that. Watch
your friendly fire.</i>

67
00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.239
Hey! Guys, remember,
if they throw a grenade,

68
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.199
you got five seconds to pick
it up and throw it back.

69
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.239
Frag out.

70
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.239
This is not a game,
gentlemen, this is real.

71
00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.279
- Be on your toes at all times.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

72
00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.706
How's my king this morning?

73
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.759
Good. I'm fine, babe.

74
00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.279
Wasting his royal talents
in the kingdom, I see.

75
00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.759
<i>Bogies at nine. Bogies at nine.</i>

76
00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.599
I don't know if you're being
sarcastic, but I'm not.

77
00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.106
Right now I'm on a black bag op.

78
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.479
Kick move!

79
00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.479
- Can we talk?
- Babe, in a second.

80
00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.319
<i>- Did you call me "babe"?</i>
- I didn't call you "babe."

81
00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.065
Shut up, Assface.
I'm talking to my lady.

82
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.759
Do what you're supposed to do.
Get eyes on that sniper.

83
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.119
Does anybody have
eyes on the sniper?

84
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.479
Ben, let's go.

85
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.919
This is not the time.

86
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.599
Stop. Ang, don't start.

87
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.159
Oh, I'm sorry, guys, the
real world needs Ben. Bye.

88
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.639
Stop playing.
Give me the joystick.

89
00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.119
Give me it back. Look at
what you're doing right now.

90
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.159
Stop. Seriously. Move
me out of the thing.

91
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.747
Put me in a bunker.
You going to get me...

92
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.759
Wow. Stop! Hey. Oh!

93
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.061
Not again, Ben.

94
00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.239
No! No!

95
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.841
<i>- That really hurts.</i>
- Oh! Oh!

96
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.119
<i>Hi, Angela.</i>

97
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.999
Even soldiers have to
get to work on time.

98
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.599
You're pro-Taliban. You are.

99
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.901
Stop.

100
00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.759
I'm sorry, guys. I had a black
bird in the living room.

101
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:24.079
I didn't hear it chirp.

102
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.959
It's not fair. Here's the thing,

103
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.519
you have to understand
how easy it is for me

104
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.119
to get caught up into that world.

105
00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.479
I feel like I had been fighting in
Pakistan for the last eight hours.

106
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.119
Okay, first of all,
"Black Hammer"?

107
00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.279
Speaking.

108
00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:36.479
What is that about?

109
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.623
That's about when I pull my penis
out and it hits the ground.

110
00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.399
Kaboom. Boom!

111
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.479
What are you laughing for?

112
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.479
You do know that you're going
to be Mrs. Black Hammer.

113
00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.079
The words every
girl wants to hear.

114
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.199
It better be.

115
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.479
Mmm. And when exactly is
this Black Hammer wedding?

116
00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:52.919
- Soon. Very, very soon.
- Mmm-hmm.

117
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.199
Things are getting close to where

118
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.439
I want them to be.
I'm figuring it out.

119
00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.159
- Can you make me one? Mmm.
- Sure.

120
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:00.079
So, is this about
you becoming a cop?

121
00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.279
Yes, it is.

122
00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.279
I got it all figured out.
Here's what's going to happen.

123
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.559
I'm going to get into
the police academy.

124
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.479
After that I'm going
to be on patrol.

125
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.359
After that I'm going
to be a detective.

126
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.119
After being a detective, I'm
going to be a lieutenant.

127
00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.999
That's how it happens.
Boom, boom, boom, boom.

128
00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.839
You know that I love you with
or without the academy, right?

129
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.639
I understand that,
but this is different.

130
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.359
I got such a good feeling, babe.
I did everything right.

131
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:24.221
Did you tell my brother
that you signed up?

132
00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.519
I'm going to be honest,
and don't get mad at me,

133
00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:27.867
but I'm going to say
what I want to say.

134
00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.479
Here's how I feel when it
comes to your brother.

135
00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.919
First of all, I've reached out,

136
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.359
but I know that your brother is
ignoring me because of that incident.

137
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:36.879
The barbeque incident was a first-degree
burn, not a third-degree burn.

138
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.670
I've gotten past it, okay.

139
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.599
He doesn't have to know.
I don't see why it's important.

140
00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.719
Seriously, Ben, if I'm ever
going to be Mrs. Hammer...

141
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.399
Black Hammer. Black Hammer.

142
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:47.225
Hammer. Got it.

143
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:49.719
I need him to be on board.

144
00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.199
You two are the most
important men in my life.

145
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.239
What you just said
has been received.

146
00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.879
I will check in.

147
00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:57.079
Give me a kiss.

148
00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:58.919
Done. You know what we're
doing tonight, right?

149
00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:00.719
- Mmm... Yes.
- What?

150
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.879
- Dinner. Yeah.
- Dinner at Dominick's.

151
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.519
A romantic dinner followed by
some sweet, sweet lovemaking,

152
00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.821
dirty style.

153
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.079
That's right. Dirty style.

154
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:12.239
Dirty style? What is that move?

155
00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.519
It's the move that Rihanna
does in that video.

156
00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:15.799
I don't think that's it.

157
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.239
This is it. It's very sexy.

158
00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.399
- Is it?
- Yes.

159
00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.039
I actually saw it in
a Kama Sutra book.

160
00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.759
They call it the "Lathered Lotus."

161
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.879
After I'm done doing that, I'm
going to give you the Kawasaki.

162
00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:25.799
I don't understand what that is.

163
00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:26.959
That's starting that bike up.

164
00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:28.719
After that, what do
you think comes last?

165
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.919
- Ah, let me guess.
- What?

166
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:31.639
Black Hammer.

167
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:33.439
That's right. Kaboom. Boom!

168
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.399
<i>Uh, dude, turn your mic off.
This is awkward.</i>

169
00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.279
<i>Is that why you call
yourself Black Hammer?</i>

170
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.742
<i>I thought it had something to
do with Thor from Avengers.</i>

171
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.399
No. Ben.

172
00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.439
Why didn't you turn the game off?

173
00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:43.559
You didn't turn the game off.

174
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:44.599
Congratulations.

175
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.559
They know we have a nasty household.
Is that what you want?

176
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.066
- Because of you.
- Whatever.

177
00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:50.959
<i>A car chase? Come on.</i>

178
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.479
<i>I authorized this operation
with very clear guidelines.</i>

179
00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.239
Instead, you shoot up a mall full of
civilians like it's a damn video game.

180
00:08:57.240 --> 00:09:00.146
And for what? Fake passports?

181
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.079
Thinking those would
lead us to Omar.

182
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.239
Of course you were.

183
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.679
Do you know how many man
hours we spent on this case?

184
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.199
And in two and a half
years you've had

185
00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.945
no breaks, so enough of this shit.

186
00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.999
Your obsession aside,
there's no criminal,

187
00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.999
nobody you get to use as an excuse

188
00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.999
for ignoring the
rules of engagement.

189
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.839
- Lieutenant, this was a special...
- Nobody!

190
00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.359
And especially not
for some lowlife

191
00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.959
nobody's ever even seen before!

192
00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:21.319
We know what he looked
like when he was nine.

193
00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.439
Shut up, Miggs.

194
00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.319
Look, these Serbs are dealing
more than just passports.

195
00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:30.999
The fact that they're still alive lets
me know they got something Omar wants.

196
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.999
Which was going to
lead us right to him.

197
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.639
Well, this Marko guy's already
lawyered up and he's refusing to talk

198
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:37.519
except to claim entrapment.

199
00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.439
Entrapment? How about
attempted murder?

200
00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.519
Asshole tried to kill me.

201
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.959
Oh, you little pussy.

202
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.519
Someday somebody's going
to shoot you in the face

203
00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:44.999
and that vest isn't
gonna do you any good.

204
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.999
The lawyer's already
claiming self-defense.

205
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.199
Says you guys fired
the first shots.

206
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:51.959
Self-defense? With all
due respect, that's bullshit.

207
00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.679
I'm shortening your leash, James.

208
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.460
We all want Omar, but these
guys are a waste of time.

209
00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.790
That's all. Get out, all of you.

210
00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:02.679
Hey, James, how about
next time that you don't

211
00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.519
tell me that this is about Omar,

212
00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:05.839
you tell me, huh?

213
00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:08.359
I don't want you to start
worrying, Santiago.

214
00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.319
Worry? What are you, my mother?
Come on, James.

215
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.039
You go into a back
room, out of contact,

216
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:13.679
you come out with three armed
guys and a motorcycle.

217
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.159
You don't want me to worry?

218
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.639
That is need-to-know information.

219
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:19.199
We're going in there with no
backup, I want to be scared, man.

220
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.199
I want to be so terrified, I'm letting
out little involuntary shits. Okay?

221
00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.879
Who put this together?

222
00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:27.679
Me. All right? Follow my lead.

223
00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.347
I'm the brains, you the brawns.

224
00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.999
The "bronze"?

225
00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.541
Yeah, it's the plural of brawn.

226
00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.146
I know.

227
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.239
<i>Since when do you need the
brother's permission?</i>

228
00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.239
He is her only living
relative, I get that.

229
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.119
Her dad was a cop.
He got killed on the job.

230
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.199
Oh, that's terrible.

231
00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.501
I'm not taking anything
away from that.

232
00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.119
But why do I have to
suck up to the brother

233
00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.865
just because she wants
us to get along?

234
00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:53.959
It would be easier, but he's still
upset because I set him on fire.

235
00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.119
- What?
- Here's the thing.

236
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.079
Doggone propane knob. What I did...

237
00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:58.870
Hold on. Hold on.

238
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:03.399
What did I tell you?
Get down! Get down, boy!

239
00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:07.039
Hey! Hey! You're white!
You're white!

240
00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.341
You don't fight.

241
00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:09.799
What's wrong with you?

242
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.226
Come on, bro, let's roll.

243
00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.749
Hey, Ramon!

244
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.000
You're not going to do
this today. Watch out.

245
00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.066
Kick move.

246
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:23.385
Hey, Ramon! Hey, hey, hey!

247
00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.559
- Ramon!
- Man, it's the rent-a-cop.

248
00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.319
I know you hear me.

249
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.439
What are you doing
with these guys?

250
00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.599
Catch you later, Ramon.

251
00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:31.159
Don't you got an
English test today?

252
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.479
You think they're going to let you

253
00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.719
play basketball if
you fail that test?

254
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.119
I already speak English.

255
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.230
Okay. Well, go ahead.
You got it figured out.

256
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.959
Hey. Before you go, let's
play this out. Okay?

257
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.799
You go with them, you get drunk.

258
00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.999
Now that you're drunk,
you can't play basketball.

259
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.347
How long before you drop out?

260
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.479
I give it a week.

261
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.279
So now you're a 17-year-old wino.

262
00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.839
When you're a wino, you
do what winos do best.

263
00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.359
You're going to jail. Once, twice.

264
00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.279
Third time you get a hard judge.
Judge gives you two choices.

265
00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.640
You got jail, you got the army.
Which one you going to take?

266
00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.639
Army ain't so bad.

267
00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:06.159
You're right, it's not.

268
00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.940
Except you forgot about
one thing. War!

269
00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.479
So now you're in Afghanistan.

270
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.359
You know what they got in
Afghanistan? Landmines!

271
00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.359
Boom! You got no legs.

272
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:17.639
So now what happens?
You're right back here.

273
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.999
You're in the streets, but let's
remember, you got no diploma,

274
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.359
you got no feet, you got no job.

275
00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.639
That means you're back
at the liquor store

276
00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.719
getting drunk all damn day.

277
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:31.279
Now that you're drunk all day, you try
to steal because you don't have a job,

278
00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:33.839
but your stealing ain't going
too good because you can't run.

279
00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.199
You know why you can't run?
Because you got no feet!

280
00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:38.959
Now you're stuck living
in a refrigerator box.

281
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.959
Here's the bad thing.
You're lonely,

282
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.959
you're in a gutter,
and you're legless.

283
00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.559
Is that what you want, huh?

284
00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:46.359
Come on, let's go!

285
00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.079
I think I'm going to
go back inside now.

286
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.839
- You going to walk.
- Run.

287
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.359
- Okay. All right.
- Sprint.

288
00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.079
Because if you didn't have
legs, you got to crawl.

289
00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.508
All right, man, go ahead.

290
00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.559
You're something else.

291
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.704
About the dumbest damn
kid in this school.

292
00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:09.319
I can't do it. I ain't gonna
be everybody's mentor.

293
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.065
I don't get paid for that.

294
00:13:12.680 --> 00:13:15.187
I've been waiting all
day to look at this.

295
00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.021
I got in!

296
00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:28.079
I'm in the academy!

297
00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.879
Freeze. Get down.

298
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.423
Freeze, you best put it down
because I'm about to make change.

299
00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.542
I have to call James!

300
00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.599
Jesus Christ!

301
00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.959
Are you blowing up there, James?

302
00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.239
I have to ditch this phone.

303
00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:48.239
You can't stop Santiago's mom, man.
You can only hope to contain.

304
00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.959
Hey, I know you're trying to insult
me, but it's just too true, bro.

305
00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.119
No, it's that little clown
that's dating my sister.

306
00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.599
About a chromosome away
from being a midget.

307
00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:59.079
I should have put a stop
to that a long time ago.

308
00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.239
So why didn't you, bro?

309
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.479
I tried.

310
00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.399
She loves his little ass. I don't
know what she sees in him.

311
00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.079
Maybe he's just a super lover.

312
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:10.599
He's short but maybe when he takes
his pants off it's just like...

313
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.199
"What is that?"

314
00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.945
Just right for her. She loves it.

315
00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.905
- What?
- That's disgusting.

316
00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.959
Look, man, does she know
you think this guy is a jerk?

317
00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.159
Have you told her that?

318
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.110
I have to come at a
different angle because

319
00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.919
she's not gonna want
me in her business.

320
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.639
I have to ditch this dude.

321
00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:36.439
Look, man, maybe this
guy is all right.

322
00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:38.469
Maybe he just wants
into the family.

323
00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.148
I know exactly what he wants.

324
00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:44.319
I love you.

325
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.667
Baby, congratulations.

326
00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.984
You know what I want to do to you?

327
00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.624
- What do you want to do?
- Let's go upstairs.

328
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.319
- No. No.
- Yeah, yeah.

329
00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.159
No, because if we go up there you
know what's going to happen.

330
00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:57.719
- You'll want to brush your teeth.
- Mmm-hmm.

331
00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:59.359
After that you're going
to wash your face.

332
00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:01.639
Then you got to put cream
and stuff on your face.

333
00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.599
Let's be spontaneous.
Let's do it right here.

334
00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:05.199
- I want to be wild like a savage.
- Okay.

335
00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.679
Give you that Kawasaki.

336
00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:08.999
I'm about to give it
to you right now.

337
00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.279
- You know what I want?
- What you want?

338
00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:11.679
I want that kaboom.

339
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:14.199
Girl, you're trying
to crawl down...

340
00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.319
The Black Hammer.

341
00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:16.679
- You want the hammer?
- I want the hammer.

342
00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.199
Then go get the hammer.

343
00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.359
Okay. Enough of that nastiness.

344
00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:20.479
Oh, my God!

345
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.623
Babe, call 911! Now!

346
00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.959
Get out of my house,
you son of a bitch!

347
00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.719
I can't believe this shit.

348
00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.879
Angela, what if I was
a real intruder?

349
00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:34.199
Instead of my brother
creeping around my house?

350
00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.501
Wasn't nobody creeping.

351
00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:38.199
You were sitting in the dark
with a coke and a hot dog.

352
00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.039
If you'd lock the door
or close the window

353
00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.679
or bar that patio like I told you.

354
00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.879
This is exactly why I didn't let
you install the alarm system.

355
00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.199
It's about who's going to
protect you. This weenie?

356
00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.359
One, he is not a weenie!

357
00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:51.199
He can be weenie-ish,

358
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:54.199
weenie-like, but I love
him, so it doesn't matter.

359
00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.159
I picture you with somebody
with a little more prestige.

360
00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.919
Somebody who plays for the Falcons

361
00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.119
or the Braves, or even the Hawks.

362
00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.399
Braves. Yeah.

363
00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:03.031
Not with the mascot.

364
00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.559
James, listen to me,

365
00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.079
you do not screw this up for me.

366
00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.679
Hey, guys.

367
00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:10.719
I can hear what you're saying.
So if you want to stop.

368
00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.879
Damn, it's Sir Scream-a-Lot.

369
00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.999
James...

370
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.039
I was responding to a
hostile situation, James.

371
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.239
I have no shame in that.

372
00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:19.519
You call for backup when
there's a hostile situation.

373
00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.919
That wasn't calling for backup.

374
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:22.679
That was a high-pitched scream,

375
00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.359
and you pushed my
sister in the way.

376
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.719
I pushed your sister
out of harm's way.

377
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.439
You shined the light at us.

378
00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.439
It's different strokes
for different folks.

379
00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:32.759
Put the ice pack in his
mouth. No, on his head.

380
00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.039
Don't put the ice pack
on my head, babe.

381
00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:36.399
I'm sensitive to extreme measures
of cold and you know that.

382
00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:37.599
Put it on your head,

383
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.239
because you just got
knocked out by yourself.

384
00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.746
James, you know what? You...

385
00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.021
Um...

386
00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.541
Guys, maybe we should...

387
00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.026
What?

388
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:55.959
Is he still staring?
Make him stop.

389
00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.479
Look. We were in the middle of
something, so you have to go.

390
00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.839
Y'all wasn't in the
middle of nothing.

391
00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:01.426
We were, James.

392
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.439
- Let's go. Get out.
- I got my sandwich over here.

393
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.959
Listen. Listen, I'm going.
Bar that patio door.

394
00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:09.945
I will. Thank you.
Promise. Love you.

395
00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.424
Hey, James, wait up.

396
00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.023
Hey, can you wait up, please?

397
00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.581
Hey.

398
00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.879
Look, man...

399
00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:22.799
I know that you don't
really like me,

400
00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.799
but I feel like you don't like
me because you don't know me.

401
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.580
Nope, you're wrong. I don't
like you because I do know you.

402
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.109
Well, I bet you'll like this.

403
00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:33.359
I got accepted into the
police academy today.

404
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.879
I'm going to be a cop. I've been
trying to call you all day.

405
00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.479
I'm finally going to have a career
that I can be proud of, man,

406
00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:41.465
and Angela can be
proud of, and you.

407
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.039
Who knows, maybe we can
be partners or something.

408
00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:47.861
Okay.

409
00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.159
Now that I got things
straight, I feel like

410
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:52.359
I can finally make your
sister an honest woman.

411
00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.310
There's just one thing
standing in the way.

412
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:58.426
I was wondering if I could get your
blessing to ask Angela to marry me.

413
00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:07.460
James?

414
00:18:09.840 --> 00:18:11.141
Did you hear what I said?

415
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.079
I have to go.

416
00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.359
Yeah, okay.

417
00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.319
I figured that you
probably just got to

418
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.319
let everything sink in,
which is fine.

419
00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.703
Maybe we could take a ride
later and talk about all this?

420
00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:28.519
Oh, shit.

421
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.119
So, just because you
joined the academy,

422
00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:33.582
that suddenly makes
you ready to propose?

423
00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:37.199
Yes. I mean, no!

424
00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.639
I've been ready.

425
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:41.519
Look, I figured that if
I made it through the academy

426
00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:42.999
that you would be
forced to accept me.

427
00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:44.199
Is that right?

428
00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.399
I just want to show
you the real me.

429
00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:47.599
I don't want to be known as
the guy who set you on fire.

430
00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:49.279
In my defense, that was a mistake.

431
00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.959
I tried to put you out.
I got water, but you panicked.

432
00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.359
I don't even want
to dig into that.

433
00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.199
That's getting off subject.
I want to talk to you...

434
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.389
Show and prove.

435
00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.959
Show and what? What are you...

436
00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.239
You want to marry my sister?

437
00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.110
Show me you're worthy of her.

438
00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:06.821
And prove to me you
got what it takes.

439
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.639
How do you want me to
do that? I don't get it.

440
00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.079
Tomorrow, I'm going to
take you on a ride-along.

441
00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:16.781
You can show me what kind
of man you're made of.

442
00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:18.599
And prove to me

443
00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:22.427
that you deserve somebody
as special as Angela.

444
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:24.629
- Hell, yeah.
- Mmm-hmm.

445
00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.950
Thank you, man.

446
00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.504
I cannot wait to show you that I'm
twice the man that you think I am.

447
00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:35.639
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

448
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.908
All right. I'll see you then.

449
00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.745
It's time to let go.

450
00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.439
Hey, this is going to be great.

451
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.742
You will not regret this.

452
00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.786
Mmm...

453
00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:01.519
Morning.

454
00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:04.391
James!

455
00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.999
Didn't I tell you to
bar that patio door?

456
00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.719
What are you doing, man?
It's 6:00 in the morning.

457
00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.119
Good cops wake up
before the crooks.

458
00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.910
Get your ass up. Let's go.

459
00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:18.380
Okay.

460
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.710
James, that's not cool!

461
00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.266
All right.

462
00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:26.111
I'm ready, man.

463
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.781
Boom.

464
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.759
You forgetting something?

465
00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:32.079
Uh-uh. Forgetting what?

466
00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.999
This could be the last time Angela
sees your little ass alive.

467
00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.745
Don't you want to say goodbye?

468
00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.999
No.

469
00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.506
You can get shot today.

470
00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.719
You know that, right?

471
00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:46.863
Dead. You.

472
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.791
Ang?

473
00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.181
Hey, babe?

474
00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:57.439
Listen, James just
told me I could die.

475
00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.199
No, you're not going to die.

476
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.599
If I do die, I want you
to know that I love you.

477
00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.719
Yes, baby, I know.

478
00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.199
If this was a latte,
it would be a love latte.

479
00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.639
And you make me think of rainbows,
because we both love colors.

480
00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.879
Aw.

481
00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:14.599
And I love the way your hands open
up and close, like monkey paws.

482
00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:16.759
Remember when we ate
that peanut butter?

483
00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:19.039
You was like, "Put it on your
nose," and I was like, "No."

484
00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.799
That's the day I fell
in love with you.

485
00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:21.999
Give me a kiss.

486
00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.519
- I want five of 'em in a row.
- Five?

487
00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.026
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

488
00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.239
Deal. Done.

489
00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.746
Go, go, go.

490
00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.879
Hey. I hope I don't die, because
I still got a lot more to say,

491
00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.467
and I know we got to go, so...

492
00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.740
All right, let's go. Kick move.

493
00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:40.279
You didn't tell me you
had a car like this!

494
00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:42.867
What's under the hood?
A 5.7 liter Hemi?

495
00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:45.479
Look at these tires! Those
are 22-inch Z Pirellis.

496
00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:46.759
That's a racing tire!

497
00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.588
Are you driving it with the traction
control or the posi... Okay. Okay.

498
00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.439
I need a minute with you.
Where's your team?

499
00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.119
I got them sitting on a location.

500
00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:38.159
Who's this?

501
00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.479
Benjamin Barber. Prospective.

502
00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.719
Prospective what?

503
00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.479
I'm a pre-cadet at the academy.

504
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.919
I didn't realize
that was a category.

505
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.639
No, I got him from that
Boys & Girls Club.

506
00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.999
I'm starting to do some
mentoring and shit.

507
00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.039
I'm just surprised you let
anybody in the car with you.

508
00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.999
I'm starting to take your advice.

509
00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.919
Letting people into my life.

510
00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:58.429
I may actually become the new
smiley face of the department.

511
00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.024
- Have a seat.
- Cool.

512
00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.719
Not there. Right there.

513
00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.799
Where you want me to sit at?

514
00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:08.999
You didn't say anything first.
You're not doing no mentoring.

515
00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.359
The other perp from the underground

516
00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.759
is in the hospital.
He just came to.

517
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:12.879
Anybody question him?

518
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:14.839
Because I'm pretty sure he
knows what's going down.

519
00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.759
Kind of hard for the guy to
talk with his jaw wired shut.

520
00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:20.159
He'll live. Hey, Lieutenant...

521
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.039
I think you're wrong about
this Serbian connection.

522
00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.359
You mean about leading to Omar?

523
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:25.185
The guy that no one's
ever seen before?

524
00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.581
Lay off, James.

525
00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:28.639
Lieutenant, you're going
to see me a lot...

526
00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.279
You got a piece of
lint on your jacket.

527
00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.582
I'm sorry. That was... I'm sorry.

528
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.639
What's up his ass?

529
00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.239
Here you go.

530
00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.919
- What's this?
- It's a waiver.

531
00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:40.159
Sign it.

532
00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:42.079
You don't just sign stuff.
What does it say?

533
00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:44.479
That states if you get
your face burnt off,

534
00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.839
or you take rebar
through your chest,

535
00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.279
or accidentally get poked
by a hep C needle,

536
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.799
or so stressed out that
you want to eat a bullet,

537
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.149
that states that you won't
bitch out and sue the city.

538
00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:58.079
City don't need that. City broke.

539
00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.279
Is this necessary?

540
00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.839
- Are you going out with him?
- Yes.

541
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.505
Oh, it's necessary.

542
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.319
Stay there.

543
00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:06.239
<i>Unit 220-C, start out on
Piedmont and Peachtree.</i>

544
00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:08.719
<i>Unit 260 is out on a signal twelve.</i>

545
00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:10.199
Hey, Gina.

546
00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:13.319
Give me all the 126s you
got today. Everything.

547
00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.679
The crazier, the better.
Send it straight to me.

548
00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.399
You want 126s?

549
00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.988
Yep. The more annoying,
the better. Do it.

550
00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:27.759
Hey, what are you doing
with my glasses?

551
00:24:27.760 --> 00:24:28.999
I wanted to see what
it looked like.

552
00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.950
- Put this on.
- What is this?

553
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.919
James!

554
00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.559
You did not tell me I was
getting a jacket in the car.

555
00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.146
Oh!

556
00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:41.479
Whoa, whoa. What's
with the tightness?

557
00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:43.039
It's a Dri-FIT compression shirt.

558
00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:45.479
Keeps my body dry.
It wicks the moisture.

559
00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:46.679
Put that jacket on,
don't take it off.

560
00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.919
Okay.

561
00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.839
I'm not. I'm not going
to sweat in it either.

562
00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:51.599
This is going to keep
my body dry. Wicks it.

563
00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.759
- Let's go.
- Wait. Let me put my gloves on.

564
00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:55.679
- Let's go.
- I knew I was going to need gloves.

565
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.719
You don't need those. Let's go.

566
00:24:57.720 --> 00:24:58.759
Okay.

567
00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.391
Wait. I got a jacket.

568
00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.627
James! Guess what just happened.

569
00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.341
<i>This is it.</i>

570
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:12.879
The real deal.

571
00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.342
The hard, gritty streets.

572
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:20.199
I am so ready for this.
I'm serious, man. Bring it on.

573
00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:22.079
- Be quiet.
- I'm sorry?

574
00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.905
You talk too much.

575
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.039
Shut up.

576
00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:27.639
Today is your Training Day.

577
00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:29.119
Let me tell you something
about that movie.

578
00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:30.959
That's motivation right there.

579
00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.519
I'm about to show you what
these streets is all about.

580
00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.839
What it takes to
be a cop out here.

581
00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.159
Right.

582
00:25:36.160 --> 00:25:37.799
But you have to follow my lead.

583
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:39.599
I need you to do everything I say

584
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.319
when I say, how I say,
and as fast as I say.

585
00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.199
I don't want no lip,
no back-talk, no "Why?"

586
00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.741
I just need you to jump
to it. You hear me?

587
00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.039
Do you want me to
say something, or...

588
00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:51.919
There's rules out here,
you know what I mean?

589
00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:53.479
Don't touch no perps

590
00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.959
unless you bringing them in.

591
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:57.679
There's no reason to
escalate any situation.

592
00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.039
You stay cool, and if
you're outnumbered,

593
00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.639
you always call for backup.

594
00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.351
Always.

595
00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.119
Not some ways.

596
00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.759
All ways. Locked in.

597
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.599
You got one day, and one day
only, to show me what you got.

598
00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.039
If you impress me,

599
00:26:12.040 --> 00:26:16.550
I have a few good words to say to the
guy over at the academy about you.

600
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.343
Hey, James...

601
00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.988
James, don't play with
me like that, man.

602
00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:23.799
Hey, give me one.

603
00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.909
You're not a fiver?

604
00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:28.024
All right. Dude, yes.

605
00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.985
All right.

606
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.799
So what are we working
on today? Omar?

607
00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:34.279
How do you know about Omar?

608
00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.469
I overheard you guys talking
about it at the station.

609
00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:38.879
What's this Omar guy look like?

610
00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:40.359
Does he have a scar
and everything?

611
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.799
Nobody knows what he looks like.
Not even his own crew.

612
00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.910
That's his power. He killed
anybody who ever seen him.

613
00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.359
<i>Unit 19, 126 in progress,
Delacey and Leeward.</i>

614
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.479
<i>Pub owner complaining about
bikes parked illegally.</i>

615
00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.544
Unit 19, copy.

616
00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:58.790
This is it?

617
00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:00.221
This is it.

618
00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.066
Oh!

619
00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.279
It's about to happen.

620
00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.439
Let me push the siren.

621
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.559
No siren.

622
00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:07.759
- This is the siren.
- It's not a siren.

623
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.983
What is that? What?

624
00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.639
That was the trunk.

625
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.559
That's pretty stupid for us to go
chase bad guys with our trunk open.

626
00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:16.640
It makes it look like we
don't know what we're doing.

627
00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.479
Okay, here's the deal.

628
00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.159
The owner of that pub
keeps complaining about

629
00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:33.021
people parking in his handicapped
spaces, and loitering.

630
00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.359
No, we don't play that.

631
00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.159
So here's what I need you to do.

632
00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.919
Go over there and simply
get them to move.

633
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.399
Okay. Uh...

634
00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:42.599
Anything I need to know, though?

635
00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.879
Like, are they into human
trafficking, dealing?

636
00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:46.159
What's these guys' resume?

637
00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:48.999
They're loitering. That's it.

638
00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.639
No. Loitering today.
It's Gotham City tomorrow.

639
00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:54.944
Scum like this need to be taken
down here and now, you know?

640
00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.864
Okay, Mr. Here-and-Now.

641
00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.199
Go make an example.

642
00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.279
All right.

643
00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.359
How do you want to do this?

644
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:01.759
You go around the front,
I go around the back?

645
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.479
Little good cop, bad cop action?

646
00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.199
- Just you.
- I don't understand...

647
00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.319
This is your chance to show me
what you're made of, all right?

648
00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.719
You got to represent now.

649
00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.639
This is not the high school quad.

650
00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:13.119
Yes.

651
00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:14.479
Don't go over there
talking to those lions

652
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.987
meowing like a pussycat.

653
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.959
What did that just mean?

654
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.279
You'll figure it out.

655
00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:22.999
I don't think you can.
That was definitely weird.

656
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.268
It's like the same thing.

657
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.879
Okay, I'm just going to go.
I'm going to go.

658
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.951
Command and respect.

659
00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.390
Good morning, gentlemen.

660
00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.264
Some nice bikes you got here.

661
00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:45.345
Harleys. I'm a Harley man myself.

662
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.946
You mind if I take a
look at this one?

663
00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:50.186
That's nice.

664
00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:51.826
Uh-oh.

665
00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.544
Houston, we have a problem.

666
00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.679
I can't help but notice that you don't
have an authorized handicap sticker

667
00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.664
on your DMV-issued license plate.

668
00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.319
Now, with that in mind,

669
00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:05.519
sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask
you guys to get on your bikes

670
00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.060
and leave this sector.

671
00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.701
What is not being understood?

672
00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.799
You done did it now.

673
00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.068
You guys think you're tough
because you're in a little gang?

674
00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.303
You want to know what
tough looks like, hmm?

675
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.065
I'm the definition of tough.

676
00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.586
My mother was a stripper.

677
00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:26.305
Her dance name was Asphalt.

678
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.183
Anybody else here been raised by a
woman who clapped her ass for money?

679
00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.839
Dollars. You haven't?

680
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.279
Which means that you wouldn't
last a day in my world.

681
00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:37.559
Let me tell you what's
going to happen.

682
00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.079
I'm going to tell you what's going to
happen quick, fast and in a hurry.

683
00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.350
You, you're gonna get some
Purell and some baby wipes,

684
00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:45.146
you're going to
clean this shit up.

685
00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.999
Do I make myself clear, mister?

686
00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.461
Huh?

687
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.039
That's not a "mister,"
that's my wife.

688
00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:53.639
I don't know what the
hell you've been

689
00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.159
looking at, but I'm
looking at a damn man.

690
00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.461
I'm looking at a...

691
00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:59.679
That might be a woman.
There's a chance of that...

692
00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:00.839
I don't care what it is!

693
00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:04.319
I'm not going to argue with you
over the sex of this thing.

694
00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:07.239
You guys are going to jail,
because I'm sick of doing this.

695
00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:10.679
What's that? Who
turned on their bike?

696
00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:14.063
Is that your bike?
Because I hear...

697
00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.519
Who called them? Did you call them?

698
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.470
One of y'all paged them?

699
00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.541
Okay.

700
00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.479
We all good for later?

701
00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:26.999
<i>Yeah, it's all set.</i>

702
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.199
James!

703
00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.119
- What about that other thing?
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

704
00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:32.519
A kid named Runflat might
have some intel on the Serbs.

705
00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.839
- <i>Runflat?</i>
- Yeah.

706
00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.359
That piece of shit.

707
00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:37.679
I'm putting cases

708
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.630
on all you bitches.

709
00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.679
You think you're going
to do this shit to me?

710
00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:44.711
You'll be playing
basketball in Pelican Bay!

711
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.439
SHU program!

712
00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.639
I'll go check it out.

713
00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:49.101
Right. Catch you later, baby.

714
00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:52.789
King Kong ain't got shit on me!

715
00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:54.705
- Really?
- Oh, shit!

716
00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.599
I'm a lion. Get your hands off me.
Get your hands off me.

717
00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.679
I said I'm a lion!

718
00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.159
You like that back, huh?

719
00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.999
Hey, hey, hey. Y'all
don't want to do that.

720
00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.239
Get off of me.

721
00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:12.399
Jesus, thank you. Come on.

722
00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.839
You didn't follow one rule.

723
00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:14.999
I did follow rules.

724
00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.984
I told you don't touch nobody.

725
00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.799
<i>It looked bad at the end,</i>

726
00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:21.959
but you have to admit that for a
second I had it under control.

727
00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.119
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

728
00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.959
- No, you didn't!
- James, that's...

729
00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.959
You were so happy to see me

730
00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.159
you damn near jumped in my lap.

731
00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:30.039
Can you stop? It's Angela. Please.

732
00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.359
I know who that is.

733
00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.264
Hey, bouncy butt.

734
00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.399
So, how's it going?

735
00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.759
- Great.
- Horrible.

736
00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.061
- Great.
- Horrible!

737
00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.620
Greatable.

738
00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.839
Yeah, babe, let me
tell you something.

739
00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.559
I'm cleaning up these
streets so good,

740
00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:46.199
you'll be able to eat off of them.

741
00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.359
Stop lying.

742
00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.079
Babe, let me let you go, because
there's a lot of stuff around here

743
00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:53.879
and you're breaking up.
I love you, though. Okay? Bye.

744
00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.959
Did you call my
sister "bouncy butt"?

745
00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.261
You don't want to know.

746
00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.359
All right, stay in the car.

747
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.799
Wait, what? I ain't staying in
no car. I'm going with you.

748
00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:06.039
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

749
00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.839
- No, you ain't.
- I want to help.

750
00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.471
I'm not staying in this car, man.

751
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.399
Cool. All right. I'll let you help.

752
00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:13.519
Thank you.

753
00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.359
I'm looking for a kid

754
00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.359
by the name of Runflat
I need to talk to.

755
00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:19.599
Runflat. Like a tire?

756
00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.079
- Long story.
- Okay.

757
00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.519
See that youngster over
there playing basketball?

758
00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.799
Black shirt, striped pants?

759
00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.079
Right there?

760
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:27.839
Yeah. That's his little brother.

761
00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.239
All I need you to do
is go over there,

762
00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.959
find out where Runflat is.

763
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.279
That's all I gotta do?

764
00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.479
Think you can handle it?

765
00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.639
Yes. And after this we're
taking off the training wheels.

766
00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.988
I'm sick of this putt-putt shit.

767
00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:49.548
All right, over.

768
00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.385
I need y'all to get out of here.

769
00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.221
Let's move.

770
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.789
Am I speaking French? Go!

771
00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.199
Uh-uh. You stay.
What's up, little man?

772
00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.719
"What's up, little man."

773
00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.079
What are you talking about?
I'm not the little man. You are.

774
00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.479
Hey, don't start this if you
don't want to finish it.

775
00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:06.959
Start what? What, you
about 3'10", 3'11"?

776
00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.719
Yeah, but you know what
I'm gonna do. Grow.

777
00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:11.591
What you gonna do?
Stretch? You hope!

778
00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:14.279
Understand something,
boy. I'm a man.

779
00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.581
Whatever you say.

780
00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.839
I'm an officer of the law.

781
00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.119
She need to stop flirting, too.

782
00:33:18.120 --> 00:33:19.626
Ronald. Talk to you.

783
00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.461
Ball up.

784
00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.279
What happened, man?

785
00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:27.879
- Where are you going, Ronald?
- Come on, man.

786
00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.799
Ronald, why are you
walking away, Ronald?

787
00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:31.359
Hey, that's my car!

788
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.999
Get your ass back. I'm using it.

789
00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.039
Take your time. You got it.

790
00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:36.519
- It's okay.
- Come on.

791
00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:37.999
Why you walking off
from me, Ronald?

792
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.559
Don't call me that around here.
Call me Runflat, okay?

793
00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.759
Don't call me by my
government name.

794
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.999
What you know about
that Serbian crew?

795
00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.479
Screw them, man.

796
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:47.999
Coming over here
thinking they own shit.

797
00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.159
How they tied into Omar?

798
00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.359
Who?

799
00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.039
Nigga, don't play with me.

800
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:53.830
You still got them pins in your...

801
00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.759
Come on. God!

802
00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.999
Mamasay, mamasa, mamakusa! Oh!

803
00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.711
Man, you're not a cop.

804
00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:01.759
I've been empowered by a cop

805
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.839
to come over here and ask you about
the whereabouts of your brother.

806
00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:05.999
Now give it up.

807
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.079
You think I'm gonna give up my
brother again? He just got out.

808
00:34:09.080 --> 00:34:10.359
You're gonna give him up.

809
00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:11.559
You came to the wrong place.

810
00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.350
I ain't telling you nothing.

811
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:15.039
What you just did
was spit on my lip.

812
00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:16.279
Yeah, I did.

813
00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.239
That just got you a
little time in prison.

814
00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.959
You're gonna tell me
what I need to know,

815
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.759
or it's gonna get real
ugly for you, Ronald.

816
00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.919
I'm going to lock you up.

817
00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:24.079
This is bullshit.

818
00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:26.399
Bullshit is my middle name.

819
00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:29.959
I got a real shaky
relationship with the truth.

820
00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:31.239
What the hell you shaking for?

821
00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:32.999
Did you take a swing at me?

822
00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.199
You reached for my...

823
00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:35.319
Going for my gun?

824
00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.799
Now I got to defend myself.

825
00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:39.467
No! Hold on, man.
I'll tell you what's up. Damn!

826
00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:42.119
All right. All I know is this.

827
00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:45.999
Serbs ran on Omar's
territory. He got mad, okay?

828
00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:49.039
They trying to push something.
They got a shipment coming in.

829
00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.239
That's all I know.

830
00:34:50.240 --> 00:34:51.799
I'm about to make
a citizen's arrest.

831
00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.559
I'll make a citizen's arrest, too.

832
00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.879
For what?

833
00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.399
Impersonating an officer.

834
00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:57.959
What?

835
00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.705
You said you were a cop.
That's illegal.

836
00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.519
That is it, boy. This is what
I'm going to do time for.

837
00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.279
You better give up your brother.
Give me your brother!

838
00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:05.359
Stranger danger!

839
00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:06.439
What?

840
00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.079
Stranger danger! Stranger danger!

841
00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.679
Man, let me fix you up.

842
00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.359
I don't want to touch you there.
You want to see my what?

843
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.919
- I don't want to see yours.
- He's playing.

844
00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.159
My mama says that's private.

845
00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:17.399
That's my nephew.

846
00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.079
He's trying to touch
all the little boys.

847
00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.159
Get him!

848
00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:21.719
Who got next? Who playing?

849
00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.879
Let's see your badge!

850
00:35:22.880 --> 00:35:24.227
You got next? What's up?

851
00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.119
I'll be leaving here
in a few minutes.

852
00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:29.159
Once this little midget
gets back in the car.

853
00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.679
Start the car!

854
00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.199
Run, shorty, run!

855
00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:35.629
Open the door!
It's me! Open the door!

856
00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.906
Go cry home to your mama.

857
00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.984
- What took you so long?
- We should go.

858
00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:42.239
Do the thing. Make the tires skirt!

859
00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:48.799
How did that work out
for you back there?

860
00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:50.181
Uh...

861
00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.719
I think it would have worked out
a lot better if I had a gun.

862
00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.999
So, you need a gun to
interrogate children?

863
00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.359
It's about having confidence.

864
00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.839
Me having a gun just gives me a
certain level of confidence.

865
00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:01.519
Knowing that it's below my belt.
That's all I'm saying, man.

866
00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:03.439
Have you ever even
held a gun before?

867
00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:07.159
The PX-48R controller is
extremely realistic. Okay?

868
00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:09.719
What are you laughing at?

869
00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:10.879
Are you talking
about a video game?

870
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.959
Yes.

871
00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:14.679
Don't mention those stupid
video games to me, okay?

872
00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.439
Don't say stupid. Don't
call my games stupid.

873
00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:17.479
It is stupid.

874
00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.239
In my world, do you know what
you would be considered?

875
00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.799
- A newbie.
- A newbie?

876
00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.599
A newbie. You have any idea
what level player I am?

877
00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:25.679
No.

878
00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.759
You have no idea.

879
00:36:26.760 --> 00:36:29.904
My gamer tag is spoken in
hushed terms of awe and envy.

880
00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.599
When I log on, people go crazy.

881
00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.479
"Oh, my God! Black Hammer's in!
Black Hammer."

882
00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.559
Shit's not real.

883
00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:37.439
You would be lost in my world.

884
00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.469
Black Hammer would not help you.

885
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:43.706
Let me show you my world,
all right? The real deal.

886
00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:49.160
Why don't we just go to
the department range?

887
00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:52.959
Because that's for cops only.
Which you are not.

888
00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.759
Yet. Which I'm not yet.

889
00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:56.439
- Hey, James.
- Hey, Val, how you doing?

890
00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:57.839
Good. How's it going?

891
00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.639
Pretty fair for a square.

892
00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.829
Got to train a new booty today.

893
00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:03.319
I'm new booty?

894
00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:05.439
- I'm Val.
- How you doing? I'm Ben. New booty.

895
00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.359
- Good to see you, Ben.
- You, too.

896
00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.199
- They got everything you need here.
- Right. Right.

897
00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:10.839
- But this the real deal.
- Mmm-hmm.

898
00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.039
It's not a Xbox. No
video game controllers.

899
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.439
- Just real deal.
- Right.

900
00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:18.439
Here's the handguns.
Val can hook you up.

901
00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:21.141
Beretta, Glock, whatever.

902
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.119
I wish Assface was here.

903
00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.519
Because he's more of a suppression
fire disciple, you know?

904
00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:27.479
I'm glad Assface is not here.

905
00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.919
Why would you say that? He should
be here. This is his world, too.

906
00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.039
Uh...

907
00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:32.399
I could choose whatever I want?

908
00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:33.759
Knock yourself out.

909
00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:37.143
All right. You said it.
No take-back-sies.

910
00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:40.719
What do I want? What do I want...

911
00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.759
Hurry up. You act like you're
looking for doughnuts.

912
00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.839
- Why are you so impatient?
- I got shit to do.

913
00:37:44.840 --> 00:37:46.239
- Give me a second.
- Let's go!

914
00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.871
Fine, fine.

915
00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.110
I want to get...

916
00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:54.959
I don't want that one.
I want this one.

917
00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.199
- I want to go with this one.
- Pick it.

918
00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.839
Smith and Wesson 500.
Let me get that.

919
00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.039
- All right.
- It's a good choice, ain't it?

920
00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:00.319
500 Smith and Wesson.

921
00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.701
You like that choice.

922
00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.799
- You like it.
- Here you go.

923
00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:05.039
Oh, ho, ho!

924
00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.839
Bang, bang... Shit!

925
00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:08.919
- Problem?
- Did you feel that? No, no problem...

926
00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:09.999
Got it?

927
00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.399
Can I do that thing?
Like how they do that...

928
00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.599
You know what?

929
00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.039
Can you do it?

930
00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.199
Let's just go with the Glock.

931
00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.319
All right.

932
00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.039
That's a good choice, boy.

933
00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.119
Don't touch me.

934
00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:21.839
That's a tap. I didn't touch you.
There's a difference.

935
00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.999
This is touching.
I didn't touch you.

936
00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.079
There we go.

937
00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:26.799
- Hey, what's this? Shit!
- Oh!

938
00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:28.599
It's all right, I got it.

939
00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.759
- You got it?
- Got it.

940
00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.799
- You want me to help you set it up?
- No, Ben I got it.

941
00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:33.943
Should we get a book?

942
00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.679
Let's see what you got.

943
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:43.799
Do we need goggles or earplugs
or anything like that?

944
00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.199
No, usually the bad guys don't give
us time to put on that kind of stuff.

945
00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.519
Okay, right. That's
actually a good point.

946
00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.759
It makes a lot of sense, and
it's better to keep it real.

947
00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:53.559
I would rather this be real.
You know what I mean?

948
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:56.181
- Keep it real.
- Yeah. Okay.

949
00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.826
Here we go.

950
00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:01.705
Freeze! How do you say freeze?

951
00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:04.151
- Freeze.
- Freeze.

952
00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:06.359
- Freeze.
- Freeze.

953
00:39:06.360 --> 00:39:09.439
Okay. You know what it is? You
don't move your top lip that much.

954
00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:11.759
I move my top lip so it
doesn't come out stern.

955
00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:13.959
- You get what I'm saying?
- Freeze.

956
00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.119
Freeze.

957
00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.919
- Just shoot.
- Shoot.

958
00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:18.119
- Shoot.
- Shoot.

959
00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:20.919
You pronounce everything.
I got you. You ready? Here we go.

960
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:23.039
Freeze! Atlanta PD!

961
00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:25.359
Get on the ground!
Hands behind your head!

962
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:26.599
Fingers laced!

963
00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:28.799
You better lace them! Lace them!

964
00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:30.239
- Shoot the gun.
- Okay. All right.

965
00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.065
Ready? Here we go.

966
00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:41.261
Damn it!

967
00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.559
I pinched it. I pinched
the inside of my hand.

968
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:47.719
I don't think the sight on
the gun is quite calibrated.

969
00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:49.624
The way I was shooting,
it looks a little...

970
00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.307
Yeah, it's off by a
centimeter or two.

971
00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:01.079
You right-handed or left-handed?

972
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.399
You were doing both.
You're ambidextrous.

973
00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.159
That's why I like shotguns. I'm
more of a shotgun specialist,

974
00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.079
because I need both of my
hands, because my upper body...

975
00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.119
Let me use your 12-gauge, man.

976
00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.787
Be careful, it's got a
magnum loaded in it.

977
00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.188
Oh, yeah.

978
00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.879
Now we're talking. The street
sweeper. Just like Fallujah.

979
00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.319
Just like Fallujah.

980
00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:24.065
My nigga.

981
00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.439
Denzel, <i>Training Day.</i>

982
00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:27.919
You might want to step
back a little bit.

983
00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:30.799
This thing got a little
kick to it. Okay?

984
00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.105
Freeze! You better stop before
I put a hole in your back!

985
00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.599
Oh, you think it's a game?

986
00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.439
Oh, it's on now!

987
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:40.071
Oh, shit!

988
00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.710
Got a little bit of kick to it.

989
00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.668
My stomach in my ass.

990
00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.183
Oh, yeah, you're ready
for the streets.

991
00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:51.827
This gun should be banned.

992
00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.959
I really appreciate everything.

993
00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.785
No problem, man.

994
00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:01.820
Well! How did it go?

995
00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:04.960
It was good. It was real good.

996
00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.039
I'm just a little rusty,
that's all, Val.

997
00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:10.079
A little more used to a
higher-grade military weapon

998
00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.759
like an RPG or a flame thrower.

999
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:14.959
Yeah, we don't really
get the exotic stuff.

1000
00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:17.799
Though we did have a couple of
Zastavas in here the other day.

1001
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.959
Let's go.

1002
00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.159
Wait a minute, you
had some Zastavas?

1003
00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:22.279
- Mmm-hmm.
- M92 or the M93?

1004
00:41:22.280 --> 00:41:23.719
I had the M92.

1005
00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.079
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

1006
00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:26.599
I was going to ask you
about the Black Arrow.

1007
00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.280
That's what I thought
you was going to say.

1008
00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.519
We're talking about the
Serbian submachine guns.

1009
00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:32.479
The M92 is a good gun,
but that Black Arrow,

1010
00:41:32.480 --> 00:41:34.439
let me tell you something,
take your back off.

1011
00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:36.559
- Serbian?
- Serbian, yes.

1012
00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.159
How the hell you know
they were Serbian?

1013
00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.439
Uh, because I'm the Black Hammer.
Platinum level. I told you that.

1014
00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.584
X-Y-C-Y. You press at the same
time and it gives you a...

1015
00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.679
Who had these guns?

1016
00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:49.279
Two guys. One white, one black.

1017
00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.439
Serbian?

1018
00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:52.599
Um, I don't know.

1019
00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.390
One had an accent.

1020
00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.671
Let's go.

1021
00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:58.839
Serbians?

1022
00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:00.759
- One had an accent?
- Yeah.

1023
00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:03.559
If you could do it,
what would it be?

1024
00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.639
What if you had the...

1025
00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.559
- Let's go.
- I'm trying to figure this...

1026
00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:09.589
Let's go.

1027
00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.959
What was that about?

1028
00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:14.359
Wait for me in the car.

1029
00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:16.279
- I just got a clue, didn't I?
- In the car.

1030
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.151
I just figured something out.
I'm gonna get in the car.

1031
00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.589
Can you at least turn the car on?

1032
00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.239
Radio or nothing.

1033
00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:24.359
What's up, boss?

1034
00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.839
<i>Listen, them Serbians,</i>

1035
00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.359
they got something big going down.

1036
00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:28.959
I think they're selling
something to Omar.

1037
00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.159
<i>I believe it's
military-grade weapons.</i>

1038
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.879
Damn, if Omar gets that kind
of firepower, holy shit!

1039
00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:35.039
<i>It'll never happen.</i>

1040
00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.959
Matter of fact, I want you to
find your boy at the Airport PD,

1041
00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.839
tell him to keep his
eyes open for anything

1042
00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:41.799
strange coming out
of Eastern Europe.

1043
00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.359
Did you listen to Brooks?
He doesn't

1044
00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:44.879
want us anywhere near
this Omar thing.

1045
00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.439
We just have to fall back, please.

1046
00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.479
Santiago, you sound like a rookie.

1047
00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:51.159
<i>Let me do the thinking
for both of us, okay?</i>

1048
00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.359
You hook that other thing up?

1049
00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:53.599
<i>Yeah, it's all set.</i>

1050
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:55.359
You're going to be hearing
from dispatch any minute now.

1051
00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.662
<i>Good. I need to get
rid of this clown.</i>

1052
00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:03.239
Sorry.

1053
00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.879
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

1054
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:08.319
My fault. I didn't know.
I didn't expect that to happen.

1055
00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:09.839
Hey, I got a clue, didn't I?

1056
00:43:09.840 --> 00:43:10.919
No.

1057
00:43:10.920 --> 00:43:12.079
Yeah, I did. I got instincts.

1058
00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:13.719
You say what you want.
You know I do.

1059
00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:16.719
You think just because you
play a little punk video game,

1060
00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:18.719
that you're ready to be a cop
out here in these streets?

1061
00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:19.879
Yes, I do.

1062
00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.679
You're ready to go toe-to-toe with
the biggest kingpin in Atlanta?

1063
00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:24.719
Yes.

1064
00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:28.119
You understand this guy has
killed cops, innocent people,

1065
00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.559
even his own crew.

1066
00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.511
And still he's got everybody
thinking he's a ghost.

1067
00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:35.199
What's your little ass gonna
do when we run up on Omar?

1068
00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:37.319
What a cop is supposed to do.

1069
00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:39.399
Why am I telling you
what I would do?

1070
00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:41.159
How about we back up?

1071
00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:43.719
How about you tell me "thank
you." That could go a long way.

1072
00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:45.079
"Thank you, Ben."

1073
00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:47.439
"You helped me with a clue.
Good instincts."

1074
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:48.559
<i>Unit 19, 126 in progress...</i>

1075
00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:49.639
Shut up. Shut up.

1076
00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:51.239
<i>Corner of State and Bellevue.</i>

1077
00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.429
Let me say "Copy." Let me say it.

1078
00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.308
Please. Come on. Let me say "Copy."

1079
00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.359
Some cop stuff.

1080
00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:00.439
Copy.

1081
00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.629
<i>19, repeat that, please.</i>

1082
00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:03.919
Copy.

1083
00:44:03.920 --> 00:44:05.159
<i>19, come again?</i>

1084
00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.759
Hold up. Wait a minute. Copy...

1085
00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:08.869
- Give me that.
- Stop it, she can't hear me!

1086
00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.119
Give me a second, dude.
Get off, man!

1087
00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.359
Get off of it!

1088
00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.039
That's my wrist. Now
that's unnecessary.

1089
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.479
Copy that.

1090
00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.759
<i>Copy that.</i>

1091
00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:22.079
Copy that for real this time.
The first one wasn't real.

1092
00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:23.239
<i>19, please repeat.</i>

1093
00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:24.359
You don't communicate,

1094
00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:26.279
because if you tell me say
"that," I will say "that."

1095
00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.039
Man, shut up.

1096
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:29.910
You bent my wrist.

1097
00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:35.111
No! She took everything!

1098
00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:37.879
She took my boat!

1099
00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:39.959
He's down there and he
won't stop throwing stuff.

1100
00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:41.279
Poor bastard's at it again.

1101
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.359
She took my car!

1102
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:43.599
This dude, again.

1103
00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:45.199
I just want my life back.

1104
00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.399
Cody Tillman, AKA Crazy Cody.

1105
00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.639
- You know him?
- No.

1106
00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:51.102
Take that!

1107
00:44:51.240 --> 00:44:52.951
Hey, hey!

1108
00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:55.639
You better sit your ass down.

1109
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.279
You stay right there,
I'm going in.

1110
00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.399
No, let me go in.

1111
00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.639
- You done. This one's mine.
- No.

1112
00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:01.639
- You stay there.
- No. I want to talk to you.

1113
00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:02.759
- No.
- Here I come.

1114
00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:04.719
- Stay! Stay!
- No! No!

1115
00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.226
I'm coming in hot.

1116
00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:09.263
Grab me, James, grab me!

1117
00:45:09.800 --> 00:45:10.999
Okay. Okay.

1118
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.679
- What you doing over here?
- I want to talk to you.

1119
00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.519
- I want to go.
- You can't handle Crazy Cody.

1120
00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:16.799
Can I please have some
of Crazy Cody? Please!

1121
00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.799
I'm breaking every
rule possible for you.

1122
00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.959
- Please.
- Okay.

1123
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.759
You get this right or I'm
taking your ass home.

1124
00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.799
- That's a deal.
- Go in there. This is a layup.

1125
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:26.590
- Show and goddamn prove.
- Hey!

1126
00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.719
Oh!

1127
00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.479
I didn't see that coming, James.

1128
00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:31.639
Stop it!

1129
00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:34.279
You're here throwing all
this produce and shit. Stop!

1130
00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:36.039
Listen to me, what you going to do

1131
00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:38.879
is get on the ground and put
your hands behind your head.

1132
00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.479
I ain't doing shit.

1133
00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:42.199
Handle this! Don't embarrass me.

1134
00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.559
- What am I doing?
- Do your job!

1135
00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.639
I'm not trying to do my job?

1136
00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.839
Do your job! Go!

1137
00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.471
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1138
00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.839
Don't you take...
Keep your clothes on!

1139
00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:52.199
They took everything else.
Might as well take my clothes.

1140
00:45:52.200 --> 00:45:53.399
Hey! Uh-uh. Uh-uh!

1141
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.599
Get this situation under control.
Make him respect you.

1142
00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:58.439
- You better not pull it out.
- It's getting pulled out.

1143
00:45:58.440 --> 00:45:59.679
He's going to pull it out!

1144
00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:00.919
Control the situation!

1145
00:46:00.920 --> 00:46:02.159
What am I supposed to do?

1146
00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:04.119
- Arrest that man.
- You want me to arrest that?

1147
00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.479
He got his penis out!

1148
00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:06.959
He is packing, though.

1149
00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.399
I got nothing.

1150
00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.639
What are you doing? Stop. Stop!

1151
00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.279
Ben, what are you waiting on?

1152
00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:14.079
He has some freak honey shit!

1153
00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:16.079
- What do you want me to do?
- Quit playing.

1154
00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:17.599
That's it. You're going to jail.

1155
00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.639
- Honey Boo Boo!
- Stop it. You're going to jail.

1156
00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:21.439
Come on. Do your job.

1157
00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:22.719
Ow!

1158
00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:24.119
That's police brutality!

1159
00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.959
Let the dude go.
His heart is broken.

1160
00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:27.199
Hold on. Hold on.

1161
00:46:27.200 --> 00:46:28.911
Ain't nobody hurting him.

1162
00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:31.666
Finish this, man.

1163
00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:37.119
Quit playing. What are you doing?

1164
00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:39.399
Eat this chip! Eat it, bitch!

1165
00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:43.599
You failing.

1166
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:44.839
I'm gonna make you my bitch.

1167
00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:46.599
You ain't gonna make me no bitch!

1168
00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:47.799
Come on, Ben.

1169
00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.959
You ain't going nowhere.

1170
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.307
No! Get off me!

1171
00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.861
Ugh.

1172
00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:56.141
Yo, stop!

1173
00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:59.159
Get off. Get off of me!

1174
00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.039
- Oh, shit.
- Stop, man!

1175
00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:02.785
I can't breathe!

1176
00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:06.079
James, he's choking me.
It's not funny no more.

1177
00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.427
Drop the bottle!

1178
00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.319
Please don't do this.

1179
00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:11.110
Now you calm down!

1180
00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:15.065
Ben. you okay?

1181
00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.661
Stupid.

1182
00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.185
You Okay?

1183
00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:28.439
Book him on drunk and disorderly,
resisting and assault.

1184
00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.071
I'll meet you up there.

1185
00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:38.359
I thought it'd be different.

1186
00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.185
I thought I'd be better.

1187
00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:54.479
I'm gonna go in here and
fill out this paperwork,

1188
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.067
then I'll be back
to take you home.

1189
00:47:58.320 --> 00:48:00.861
Don't worry about it,
man, you'll be all right.

1190
00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:17.759
Hey, babe.

1191
00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.399
<i>Hey, babe, how's it going?</i>

1192
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:21.239
Fine. It's going fine.

1193
00:48:21.240 --> 00:48:23.429
Okay.

1194
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:27.959
So, it's the weekend and
I was going to make plans.

1195
00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:30.359
<i>I was thinking maybe we can go
to that new restaurant or...</i>

1196
00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.159
Babe, I don't want to do nothing.

1197
00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:34.039
I just want to stay in the
house and play my game.

1198
00:48:34.040 --> 00:48:35.279
<i>I don't feel like being bothered.</i>

1199
00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:36.627
What's wrong?

1200
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.319
<i>Come on, babe, talk.</i>

1201
00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.999
You want to know what's wrong?
Everything is wrong.

1202
00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.279
<i>I don't know if I can do this.</i>

1203
00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:43.519
What happened?

1204
00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:45.759
<i>It's not what happened,
it's what didn't happen.</i>

1205
00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:48.839
I met the damn devil today
in the form of a child.

1206
00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:50.119
Little boy was disrespectful.

1207
00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.639
He didn't respect me as a
man, he had a foul mouth.

1208
00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:54.639
We could start off
there, or if you want,

1209
00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:56.919
we could talk about
the fact that I got

1210
00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.279
confronted by a
man-lady biker thing.

1211
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.879
I didn't know what it was. All
I know is she had a beard and breasts,

1212
00:49:01.880 --> 00:49:04.599
<i>but the fact I thought it was a
man and spoke on it, I'm wrong.</i>

1213
00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:06.159
"You got the beard, not me!"

1214
00:49:06.160 --> 00:49:08.639
And to top it off, I go
to the farmers' market,

1215
00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:11.799
I get into a dispute with
a guy named Crazy Cody,

1216
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.559
<i>he started pouring
honey on his body,</i>

1217
00:49:13.560 --> 00:49:15.119
I'm wrestling a man with honey!

1218
00:49:15.120 --> 00:49:18.799
No, wait a minute, Ben.
Did you say Crazy Cody?

1219
00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.599
Yeah. What does that
have to do with anything?

1220
00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:24.461
Baby, James plays poker with
a guy named Crazy Cody.

1221
00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:25.759
What? What?

1222
00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.904
He's a blonde-haired white guy.
He's known him a long time.

1223
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:30.941
Hey.

1224
00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.759
Question, babe, you
ever heard of a 126?

1225
00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.239
Yeah. It's a cop code for an
annoying situation nobody wants.

1226
00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.861
They do it to rookies. It's a joke.

1227
00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:41.079
<i>Why?</i>

1228
00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:42.679
Nothing. Babe, let me let you go.

1229
00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.599
I have to go. I'll call you
later, okay? I love you.

1230
00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:47.199
I love you, too.

1231
00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:49.946
I got your damn 126.

1232
00:50:02.840 --> 00:50:04.159
So, I'm standing there, right?

1233
00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.599
The guy's coming at me, he's like,
"I'm nervous, I'm nervous."

1234
00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:08.959
He's like, "Put your hands up."

1235
00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:11.422
And the closer he gets,
the shorter he gets.

1236
00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.599
And he's coming at me, then it
was like a Cabbage Patch doll.

1237
00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:16.559
I've never seen anything like it.
Then he gets on me,

1238
00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:18.279
tries to put the
cuffs on me, barn.

1239
00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.199
I got honey on me, I'm
yelling, "Oh, Honey Boo Boo!"

1240
00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.479
So, can we stop with these 126s
or is this guy coming back?

1241
00:50:24.480 --> 00:50:27.399
Oh, no. He's done. You hear me?

1242
00:50:27.400 --> 00:50:29.439
Done. Anybody got a fork?

1243
00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.359
I'm serious, you know.
Matter of fact,

1244
00:50:32.360 --> 00:50:35.839
I don't even think he going
to join the academy. Yeah.

1245
00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.585
All in all, I got to say,

1246
00:50:38.360 --> 00:50:40.389
today was a good day.

1247
00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:48.319
All right, let's get you
home. Tucked in.

1248
00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.599
<i>Unit 19, 126 in progress.</i>

1249
00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.759
<i>Suspicious person,
55 North Peachtree.</i>

1250
00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:56.399
Hey, baby, cancel that 126.

1251
00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.799
As a matter of fact, I'm going
to be offline for about a hour.

1252
00:50:58.800 --> 00:51:00.519
No, you know what? On
second thought, copy that.

1253
00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.119
Unit 19 en route to 551 Peachtree.

1254
00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:04.679
- Copy that.
- <i>Copy that.</i>

1255
00:51:04.680 --> 00:51:05.839
The hell you doing?

1256
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.119
I told you I want to be
a cop. I want to be a cop.

1257
00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:10.039
And that 126 might be serious.

1258
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.439
I feel like I got my second wind.

1259
00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.639
Like I'm Action Jackson
or somebody right now.

1260
00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:14.799
Let's go.

1261
00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:16.679
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We discussed this.

1262
00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:18.479
- You not cut out for this work.
- That's not true.

1263
00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.559
I'm taking you home.

1264
00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:22.079
I'm not going home like this.
It's not going to happen.

1265
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.919
Now, if this doesn't go well,
I will be out of your hair, James.

1266
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:26.879
All this cop talk
will be finished.

1267
00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:28.341
Matter of fact, I'll go one up.

1268
00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:30.039
If this doesn't work,

1269
00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:34.140
I will call Angela right
now and tell her myself.

1270
00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:38.867
Your funeral.

1271
00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.705
Indeed it is.

1272
00:51:49.400 --> 00:51:50.639
What's the problem this time?

1273
00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:53.199
I don't like these guys.
Something's wrong.

1274
00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.839
You're gonna have
to get a bouncer.

1275
00:51:54.840 --> 00:51:57.799
The department is getting
tired of doing this for free.

1276
00:51:57.800 --> 00:51:59.399
I'm serious this time.

1277
00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:02.079
The one by the bar.
Other dude, blue jacket.

1278
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.839
They've been casing
this place all week.

1279
00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.380
I think you're right this time.

1280
00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.079
I need you to go to
the car, call in 211,

1281
00:52:09.080 --> 00:52:10.711
tell them we need a backup.

1282
00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.425
Okay. Will do.

1283
00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.501
Ben!

1284
00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:17.799
What are you doing?

1285
00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.590
I want to go talk to him.

1286
00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.359
Gonna do it now.

1287
00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:22.879
Everybody on the floor!

1288
00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.799
Get on the ground.
On the ground! Now!

1289
00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:29.785
Atlanta Vice! Everybody be cool.

1290
00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.106
No, no, no. Don't nobody be cool.

1291
00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:36.759
We're about to heat this up.

1292
00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:37.959
- Ben!
- Yes?

1293
00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:39.199
Back to the car. Call for backup.

1294
00:52:39.200 --> 00:52:40.439
No!

1295
00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:42.479
Look, the situation's
already in progress.

1296
00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.879
- I got this.
- Ben!

1297
00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:45.159
- Get down!
- Yeah.

1298
00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:47.959
Get up, baby, stop.
It's not real, it's fake.

1299
00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.799
Man, you got to be kidding me!

1300
00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.262
You gonna pull out a gun
when you looking at this?

1301
00:52:52.760 --> 00:52:53.959
Get down, baby.
I didn't know it was

1302
00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:55.119
this much of a height difference.

1303
00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.239
Thank you. I'm gonna tip you.

1304
00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:57.999
Get 100 ones.
I got you in a second.

1305
00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.279
You better chill, man.

1306
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:00.519
Put the gun down.

1307
00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.119
- We got hostages.
- Oh, no!

1308
00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:05.310
James, they got hostages.

1309
00:53:05.920 --> 00:53:08.119
You ain't gonna shoot me.

1310
00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.399
I'm gonna do it!

1311
00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.479
You do it, you next.

1312
00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:11.559
- Ben!
- Yes?

1313
00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:12.679
Stand down!

1314
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:14.061
I ain't gonna stand down.

1315
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:16.264
I never stand down...

1316
00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.223
from a 126.

1317
00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.999
This ain't no joke, man.
This is the real deal.

1318
00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.719
You right, James, this ain't no
joke. This is dead serious.

1319
00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:29.199
We serious up in here.

1320
00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:31.559
Shut up! You're about
to get us killed, cop.

1321
00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.719
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold on, cowboy.

1322
00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:35.239
Oh, God!

1323
00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.919
I got a way for you to
get out of here. Okay?

1324
00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.439
Put the gun down.

1325
00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:42.879
I'll forget you had hostages, and
y'all won't get that much time.

1326
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:44.119
No! Overruled. No.

1327
00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.439
Overruled?

1328
00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:47.639
Overruled! I don't like it.
I don't want to do that.

1329
00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.799
Why...

1330
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:51.359
Why would I do that, man?

1331
00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.439
Why do that when we can handle
this right here, right now.

1332
00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.199
One winner, one loser.
Let's get to shooting!

1333
00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.999
- Ben!
- Let's shoot! Let's start shooting!

1334
00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.679
Man, you crazy!

1335
00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:00.959
Yeah, I am crazy.

1336
00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.799
Only thing that can kill crazy is a
bullet. You got that bullet, huh?

1337
00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:05.439
Can you kill crazy? Kill crazy!

1338
00:54:05.440 --> 00:54:06.559
Ben, get out of there!

1339
00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.039
Come on, Tim, what's the move?

1340
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:09.359
Yeah, what's the move, Tim?

1341
00:54:09.360 --> 00:54:12.759
He got to ask you because you
can't make no decisions.

1342
00:54:12.760 --> 00:54:15.559
The black man is following
the white man once again.

1343
00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:17.159
Make a decision by yourself.

1344
00:54:17.160 --> 00:54:18.439
Tim, I'm back over here to you.

1345
00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.439
What you going to do?
It's a chessboard.

1346
00:54:20.440 --> 00:54:22.399
I'm a rook. I'm about
to take your bishop,

1347
00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:23.719
but I can't because
I got your queen.

1348
00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:25.119
Where I go? Where am I?

1349
00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:26.799
I'm gonna stop so you can see me.

1350
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:28.919
You see me, huh?
You see me? Shoot!

1351
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.719
- Ben!
- I'm going to do this fool!

1352
00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:33.068
Do me! Do me!

1353
00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:38.559
He tried to do me!

1354
00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.907
Freeze!

1355
00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.426
Bitch, you better
get down and shoot!

1356
00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:46.719
James, this is real!
This shit is real!

1357
00:54:46.720 --> 00:54:48.079
Don't you move, boy.

1358
00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:49.959
Oh, Jesus! This is real!

1359
00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:53.159
Take it easy, man.
I didn't even do anything.

1360
00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:55.542
Hey, don't say anything.

1361
00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.199
Keep me away from this psycho.

1362
00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.990
Ow! Come on, man.

1363
00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.359
Where do I start?

1364
00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:03.439
Could say "good job."

1365
00:55:03.440 --> 00:55:05.359
You think because you're better
than the average riff-raff

1366
00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.919
that gives you the right
to do things your own way?

1367
00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.399
To tote that little civilian bastard
into an active crime scene?

1368
00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:14.679
L-T, I did not know it was going
down like this, all right.

1369
00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:17.559
This owner right here
is always crying wolf.

1370
00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:20.101
We come by to check it
out, it's going down.

1371
00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:23.504
Perp gets shot, no other
fatalities. What's the big deal?

1372
00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:24.799
You want a medal for that?

1373
00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.919
Now I hear you took
him to a gun range?

1374
00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.109
And something about
military weapons and Omar?

1375
00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:31.359
That dry, snitching-ass Santiago.

1376
00:55:31.360 --> 00:55:34.550
It's not Santiago! I got ears
out here just like you do.

1377
00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:36.511
I told you to leave it alone.

1378
00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.311
But you're out here on your own.

1379
00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.719
I don't know half the
shit you're working.

1380
00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.919
And all you say is "trust me"?

1381
00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.267
You should.

1382
00:55:43.840 --> 00:55:45.759
Haven't I earned that?

1383
00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.585
Let me be clear.

1384
00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.679
I can only cover your ass so much.

1385
00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.141
So clean your shit up.

1386
00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:52.991
Or I'll clean it up for you.

1387
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:00.239
You, get in the car, you done.

1388
00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:01.666
Why?

1389
00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:03.719
We got more important 126s?

1390
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:05.039
You almost got me killed!

1391
00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.719
Almost don't count.

1392
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.039
So, you done. Let's go.

1393
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.341
No, I'm not done.

1394
00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:11.399
I want to talk some more, I got
something else I want to say.

1395
00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:13.399
I may not be a cop right now,

1396
00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:15.959
but I will be.
You hear me? I will be.

1397
00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:19.119
And there is nothing that
you can do about that.

1398
00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.159
- I tried to help you.
- Hey! Hey, man!

1399
00:56:21.160 --> 00:56:24.639
You came to me and said, give me
a day to show me what you got.

1400
00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.021
I gave you a day.

1401
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:27.479
It's not good enough.

1402
00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.599
So the answer to
your question is no!

1403
00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:32.679
I do not give you my blessing.

1404
00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:34.519
I don't need your blessing.

1405
00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:38.719
This isn't Afghanistan. I'm not
about to buy her with a goat.

1406
00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.399
That girl loves me, man.

1407
00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:43.719
That girl loves all of this.

1408
00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:46.319
Breathe it in, because
it's in your face.

1409
00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.985
I'm taking care of her, not you.

1410
00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.239
- You?
- Me.

1411
00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:51.747
You can't even take
care of yourself.

1412
00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.759
You wouldn't last
one day out here.

1413
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.799
You think I'm gonna become a
cop and get myself killed?

1414
00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:56.879
Leave her by herself?

1415
00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.999
This conversation is over.

1416
00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.119
Get in the car.

1417
00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.639
This is your problem, man.

1418
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.479
It's why you don't
have no damn partner.

1419
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.839
You walk around here by yourself

1420
00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.279
because you don't trust nobody.

1421
00:57:05.280 --> 00:57:07.559
Eventually you're gonna have
to trust somebody, James.

1422
00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:09.199
I'd never trust you.

1423
00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:11.229
I'd never trust you with my life.

1424
00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.239
And my family's life?

1425
00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.666
Can you comprehend that?

1426
00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:16.359
You don't even know
why you don't like me.

1427
00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:18.599
Tell me why! You don't know why.

1428
00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.199
Because you don't know me, James.

1429
00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:21.439
I know who you are.

1430
00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.439
You that clown
that's always trying

1431
00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.519
to talk yourself out
of every situation.

1432
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.185
No matter how deep you in it.

1433
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.902
That's a bad character
trait for a cop.

1434
00:57:30.160 --> 00:57:32.319
So get your ass in the
car so we can go.

1435
00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:33.759
- I ain't getting in no car.
- You getting in the car.

1436
00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.471
I'm not getting in no car.

1437
00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.061
Walk.

1438
00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.319
You think I've never
walked before? I'll walk.

1439
00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:40.599
You think I'm gonna beg you?

1440
00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.559
Don't beg me. I'll walk.

1441
00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.279
Let me jump in because
I don't know where I'm at.

1442
00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.786
Back seat.

1443
00:57:49.880 --> 00:57:52.148
- I'm not getting in no back seat.
- Back seat.

1444
00:57:52.560 --> 00:57:53.941
No.

1445
00:57:58.520 --> 00:57:59.867
James?

1446
00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.867
Hey, James?

1447
00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:04.187
James?

1448
00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:07.799
James?

1449
00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:09.479
Can you at least let me ride
in the front seat, please?

1450
00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:10.941
Shut up.

1451
00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.919
Before I tase you in the mouth.

1452
00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:14.719
That's illegal.
That's very illegal.

1453
00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:18.919
What?

1454
00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:20.079
Did you hear about Runflat?

1455
00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.919
Turned himself in to
County this morning.

1456
00:58:21.920 --> 00:58:24.399
<i>Confessed to vandalism.
Weird. Weird.</i>

1457
00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.519
That ain't weird. He just scared.

1458
00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:29.519
Trying to get off
the streets. It's Omar.

1459
00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.479
<i>If he's onto Runflat, then
he's definitely onto us.</i>

1460
00:58:32.480 --> 00:58:34.079
We might want to pull our skirts

1461
00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:35.759
over our faces and
just back off, huh?

1462
00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.879
It will never happen, all right?

1463
00:58:37.880 --> 00:58:38.959
So just keep your eyes open.

1464
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.119
<i>All right, copy that.</i>

1465
00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:41.639
That's a damn shame.

1466
00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.319
Boy just got out of jail and
now he got to go back already.

1467
00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:46.759
See, that's where you don't
know what you're talking about.

1468
00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.279
Runflat ain't been on the
inside for about two years now.

1469
00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:52.469
That's not what his brother said.

1470
00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:56.759
- Ow, man!
- What did he say?

1471
00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:58.279
I'm not telling you
nothing after that.

1472
00:58:58.280 --> 00:58:59.866
What did he say?

1473
00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:04.679
He said, "You think I'm gonna give
him up when he just got back?"

1474
00:59:04.680 --> 00:59:05.959
That's exactly what he said?

1475
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.308
I got perfect conversation
recall. It's a gift.

1476
00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:10.239
I just got another clue.

1477
00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:11.759
This is a two-clue
kind of day for me,

1478
00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.039
and being that that's the case,

1479
00:59:13.040 --> 00:59:14.319
I need to be in the
front seat right now.

1480
00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.439
- No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.

1481
00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:18.799
The kid's got another brother
that drove for Omar, all right?

1482
00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:21.319
He escaped custody, left town.

1483
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:25.639
Now, no way he'd risk coming
back unless he had to be.

1484
00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:26.999
So, what's our move?

1485
00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.799
My move is to find the brother.

1486
00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:31.719
Oh, come on. Come on, James,
after all I just did?

1487
00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.799
What'd you do?

1488
00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:33.999
I'm giving you clues
left and right!

1489
00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.039
- No.
- I can help!

1490
00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:37.839
I'll keep my distance. I'm serious.

1491
00:59:37.840 --> 00:59:39.479
Veto. You're done.

1492
00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.159
Fine. Take me home.
I don't need this.

1493
00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:42.639
- I'm going home.
- I'll take you home.

1494
00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.879
I'm going to go home
and use the phone,

1495
00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:45.359
call Lieutenant
Brooks and tell him

1496
00:59:45.360 --> 00:59:46.879
you out here freelancing
this Omar case.

1497
00:59:46.880 --> 00:59:48.519
See what he thinks about that.

1498
00:59:48.520 --> 00:59:50.319
- You better not.
- Oh, I am.

1499
00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.479
You'd call the
lieutenant and tell...

1500
00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:53.464
You damn right I'll
call the lieutenant.

1501
00:59:54.520 --> 00:59:56.159
You little snitch bitch.

1502
00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.701
Call me whatever you want.
Snitch Bitch Ben.

1503
01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:20.239
Hey, man, you know where
I can get these things?

1504
01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:23.479
Oh, hell no! I got the right
to refuse service...

1505
01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:25.703
You better be lucky it wasn't me.

1506
01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.183
James, you broke the glass!

1507
01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.199
Oh, shit!

1508
01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:32.719
What's up? Come here.
Get your ass over here, boy.

1509
01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:34.039
Get your hands off me, pig!

1510
01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.359
What you doing? Hey!

1511
01:00:35.360 --> 01:00:39.079
How stupid are you to hide out in the
same place we found you before, Jay?

1512
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:41.399
Plain sight. Classic tactic, man.

1513
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.279
You better tell me where that
Serbian buy is going down, boy,

1514
01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:46.199
or I'm gonna give you
a classic tactic.

1515
01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.719
I ain't telling you nothing!

1516
01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:50.039
Why'd you even come
back, Jay, huh?

1517
01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.079
This is becoming
a family tradition.

1518
01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:56.079
Tell me where that buy is, or you
going to jail with a bullet wound.

1519
01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.079
You think he playing with you?
You think he got time for games?

1520
01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:00.559
This man is crazy. If he pull the
gun out, that means he serious.

1521
01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.639
Tell him where the
buy is going down.

1522
01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.066
Where's it going down at?

1523
01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.559
Bullshit.

1524
01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:06.039
Bullshit?

1525
01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:07.919
Oh, no, this is real shit.

1526
01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.839
You better tell me where
that buy going down!

1527
01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.159
Tell us where the buy is. You hear
me? Tell us where the buy is!

1528
01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:14.679
Forget both of y'all!

1529
01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:15.999
Really? That's how you feel?

1530
01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.439
- You want to feel this?
- That's right!

1531
01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:19.902
You want to see crazy?
I'll show you crazy!

1532
01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.839
Tell me where the buy is!
Tell me where...

1533
01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:24.679
Oh, shit.

1534
01:01:24.680 --> 01:01:26.439
He shot me!

1535
01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:28.119
I'm sorry.

1536
01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.679
Yeah, he shot your ass.

1537
01:01:29.680 --> 01:01:31.359
You damn right I shot your ass.

1538
01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.199
- He going to shoot you again.
- No. No.

1539
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.959
Because he crazy.
I can't handle this one.

1540
01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.119
I'm crazy.

1541
01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.759
I can't handle this one.
It's out of my hands.

1542
01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.999
You want to see crazy?

1543
01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.559
I'll show you crazy!
You think it's a game?

1544
01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:42.679
Tell us where the buy is!

1545
01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:43.999
You better tell me
where the buy is!

1546
01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.631
- Okay.
- Okay.

1547
01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:49.639
It's at the old factory. The
abandoned one off of Huber.

1548
01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:51.439
- Okay.
- Old abandoned factory.

1549
01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.469
- What time?
- 9:00.

1550
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:56.279
If you lying, Jay, I'm gonna
shoot you in the other shoulder.

1551
01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.639
Just keep him away from me!

1552
01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.119
Boy, you want it hot?

1553
01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:01.479
You want to get some
hot slugs up in you?

1554
01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:02.799
Slugfest, homie.

1555
01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:04.943
Chitty-chitty-bang-bang!

1556
01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:08.639
Hey, man, it's going down now.

1557
01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.959
Over at that old factory on Huber.

1558
01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.319
<i>Shit.</i>

1559
01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.519
Okay, I'm on my way.

1560
01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.439
I'm calling in for some
heavy backup, all right?

1561
01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.639
All right.

1562
01:02:15.640 --> 01:02:16.941
Where'd you get that gun?

1563
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.639
I kept it from the club.

1564
01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.879
You know the guy you
shot in the ass?

1565
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:22.944
- Come on, man!
- Now!

1566
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.790
- Here!
- Hey, mother...

1567
01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:29.479
I thought the safety was on. I got
him to talk though, didn't I?

1568
01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:32.319
Yeah, you got a very interesting
interrogation voice.

1569
01:02:32.320 --> 01:02:33.839
Nice and screechy.

1570
01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.359
Okay. It's all this intensity.

1571
01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.185
That's what it is.

1572
01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.479
Wait for me here.

1573
01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:57.999
Are you serious?

1574
01:02:58.000 --> 01:02:59.319
Of course I'm serious.

1575
01:02:59.320 --> 01:03:01.519
If I had time to drop you
off, I would, but I don't.

1576
01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:04.239
It's my clue that got us here.
I've been helping you all day!

1577
01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:05.639
- Oh, you have?
- Yes.

1578
01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:08.239
Is that why you just shot
somebody? On accident?

1579
01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:09.319
That's not fair.

1580
01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:12.359
And before that, you asked a
suspect to actually execute you.

1581
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.919
That's because I thought it was
another 126. You know that.

1582
01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.919
This is not another 126, Ben.

1583
01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.719
This is the real deal.

1584
01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:20.839
So the time for jokes is over.

1585
01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.399
So the kind of help you got, it's
not the kind of help I need.

1586
01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:24.879
I'm just trying to go...

1587
01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:26.591
Do I have to cuff
you to the wheel?

1588
01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:31.708
You ain't gotta do that.

1589
01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.901
Where's your ride-along?

1590
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.599
He flamed out. I had
to take him back.

1591
01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.719
Where's backup?

1592
01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.879
Probably running late.

1593
01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:46.519
Listen, I got a look inside.

1594
01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.709
They're all in there, it's
going down right now.

1595
01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.119
We not waiting.

1596
01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:52.919
Just FYI, when I get in there I'm
gonna start shooting people.

1597
01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:54.239
I haven't shot anybody all day.

1598
01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.065
We know, Santiago. Let's hit it.

1599
01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:19.759
Okay. Here's what
we should do. I...

1600
01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.559
Man, what the... Oh!

1601
01:04:21.560 --> 01:04:22.959
Oh, hell no.

1602
01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.159
That's right. Stay still.

1603
01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.719
Yeah, surprise.

1604
01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.279
I don't want to hear that.

1605
01:04:32.240 --> 01:04:35.519
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-
M-N-O-P... I can't do it.

1606
01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.799
I can't believe you two punks been
protecting Omar this whole time.

1607
01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.119
Pays well.

1608
01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.599
No benefits, but we get
those from the day job.

1609
01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.799
I should have known.

1610
01:04:48.800 --> 01:04:50.079
Greedy bastards.

1611
01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:51.959
James, we're not
giving anything away.

1612
01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.759
We're selling it because
we're businessmen.

1613
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.639
And we're enterprising it so that
Omar won't have to hide no more.

1614
01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.519
And all you had to do was
just let it go for one day.

1615
01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:00.799
If you had let it go for one day,

1616
01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:02.306
you wouldn't be here right now.

1617
01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.279
Now things are not gonna
end well for you.

1618
01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.519
Yeah, don't be too sure.

1619
01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.982
You didn't want to play
ball, so here we are.

1620
01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.119
It's not easy on us
either, believe me.

1621
01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:26.462
Oh, my God! Shit!

1622
01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:28.959
Thank you.

1623
01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:32.679
Omar appreciates the
delivery of his weapons.

1624
01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:33.839
What is this?

1625
01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:36.879
That's just a loose end that we're
gonna take care of very soon.

1626
01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:38.670
Added bonus for Omar.

1627
01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.039
- So, can we do business now?
- Yeah.

1628
01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:42.279
Can I see the merchandise?

1629
01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.741
Victor.

1630
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.559
- Didn't have to be like this, James.
- Nice.

1631
01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:49.239
You could've had a
little taste of that.

1632
01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:52.199
I for one, though, I feel hurt,
because we never hung out.

1633
01:05:52.200 --> 01:05:55.185
We never watched sports or
shared some chicks together.

1634
01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:57.463
It must be tough being
an island though, huh?

1635
01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.191
Nobody to have your back.

1636
01:05:59.240 --> 01:06:01.999
You know what? You should
see a therapist about this,

1637
01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:04.302
because you don't want to
spend the rest of your life...

1638
01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:06.559
Oh, I'm sorry.

1639
01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:09.039
I forgot. You're about to die.

1640
01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:11.879
I want that one for myself.

1641
01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:24.545
Who the hell are you?

1642
01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:26.660
Who am I?

1643
01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:29.389
Who am I?

1644
01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.279
Oh, shit.

1645
01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:34.199
Yeah, that makes me laugh.

1646
01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.119
Especially considering the
fact that this is my deal.

1647
01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:38.239
That these are my men.

1648
01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:39.621
Wait a minute.

1649
01:06:39.920 --> 01:06:41.221
You're Omar?

1650
01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.279
That's right.

1651
01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:45.706
Omar is here.

1652
01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.559
I know what you're thinking.

1653
01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:49.639
Nobody's ever expecting
to see Omar,

1654
01:06:49.640 --> 01:06:52.119
but he's here. And why is that?

1655
01:06:52.120 --> 01:06:55.879
Nobody can tell me why
because it's a surprise.

1656
01:06:55.880 --> 01:06:58.239
This is a surprise inspection.

1657
01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.799
So I suggest you all put
a smile on your face,

1658
01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:05.150
because today is the day that
I finally decided to let you see mine.

1659
01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:09.106
Welcome to me.

1660
01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:12.319
Where's Jay?

1661
01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.145
Oh, Jay?

1662
01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:17.550
I left Jay ass at the pawn
shop because he wasn't prompt.

1663
01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:21.959
Everybody knows that
I like my shit prompt.

1664
01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:23.421
It's more professional that way.

1665
01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.221
Ain't that right, my Serbs?

1666
01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:28.759
I've been keeping tabs on all
of you for some time now.

1667
01:07:28.760 --> 01:07:29.799
You.

1668
01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.319
Oh...

1669
01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:34.385
Let me take the time
out to give you this.

1670
01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.519
Yeah.

1671
01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:41.079
You have been crushing all
week, you hear me? Yeah.

1672
01:07:41.080 --> 01:07:42.999
I need more men like you.

1673
01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.506
You're a good man, you know that?

1674
01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:47.221
I want you to keep
keeping on, young butt.

1675
01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:50.159
Matter of fact, do me a
favor and give Omar a gun.

1676
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.507
A gun?

1677
01:07:51.600 --> 01:07:53.119
Did I stutter, hmm?

1678
01:07:53.120 --> 01:07:54.639
You're gonna embarrass
me in front of

1679
01:07:54.640 --> 01:07:56.199
my crew after I just
gave you a compliment?

1680
01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.582
I said, give Omar a gun.

1681
01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:10.825
Hold up. Now hold up.
I thought Omar was 6'4".

1682
01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.867
How tall is Omar now?

1683
01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.501
Anybody else want to weigh in
on how tall he thinks Omar is?

1684
01:08:25.800 --> 01:08:28.319
No? Does anybody else
want to test me?

1685
01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.519
We weren't expecting to see you.

1686
01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:33.559
But it's better that we deal
with this business personally.

1687
01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.023
Of course it is. I'm sorry
you had to see that shit.

1688
01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:40.359
Hey, and I want to apologize for
this because that's not me, okay?

1689
01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.839
I don't want y'all thinking it
is, and this is stupid, too.

1690
01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:44.380
So I'm sorry for that.

1691
01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:48.039
Now, I gotta take the time

1692
01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:52.079
to give a special shout-out
to Miggs and Santiago.

1693
01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:53.541
Hell, yeah.

1694
01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.039
Yeah!

1695
01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:57.439
I'm clapping, ain't I?

1696
01:08:57.440 --> 01:08:58.980
Am I mapping?

1697
01:09:00.560 --> 01:09:02.679
Yeah!

1698
01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:04.550
My double agents.

1699
01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:07.586
You guys brought me the
best prize of them all.

1700
01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.599
James Payton.

1701
01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:10.879
What you think you doing...

1702
01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:12.386
Shut your ass up, man!

1703
01:09:14.520 --> 01:09:17.903
You don't have the right to talk.

1704
01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.461
I'm gonna kill you.

1705
01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.399
See, James, for those
who don't know,

1706
01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:27.519
James has been chasing my ass day
and night for some time now.

1707
01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:30.559
But he can never catch me.
You know why?

1708
01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.599
Because he's one of those people

1709
01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:34.599
who thinks he always knows best.

1710
01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:36.919
Doesn't think that people are
good enough for certain people,

1711
01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:39.382
without even really knowing
those other people.

1712
01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.221
You with me?

1713
01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:45.879
Guess what today is, big man?
Today is the day that you die.

1714
01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.159
Mmm-hmm.

1715
01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:49.622
I'm going to have to put
some tarps down and shit.

1716
01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.879
Now I might finish
you off with my gun,

1717
01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:53.119
I might.

1718
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.881
But I'm going to start you off with
the cold steel of my katana blade.

1719
01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:59.079
I'm talking death
by a thousand cuts.

1720
01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:00.541
Oh, I'd like to see that.

1721
01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:03.905
Give us a little taste of that.

1722
01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.906
Yeah, I'd be entertained by that.

1723
01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:07.079
A little preview. Come on.

1724
01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:08.381
Hell yeah.

1725
01:10:15.080 --> 01:10:16.381
Okay.

1726
01:10:16.520 --> 01:10:18.399
You ready? Here it come.

1727
01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:19.519
Don't you.

1728
01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.159
- I gotta cut you.
- Don't you cut me.

1729
01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:23.667
What you think I gotta do?
I gotta do it!

1730
01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.746
Yeah!

1731
01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.959
That's what you get, po-po!

1732
01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:45.799
Maybe stab him a little
more, cut him more.

1733
01:10:45.800 --> 01:10:48.839
Shut your ass up.
I ain't no show pony.

1734
01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.824
This shit is over.

1735
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.507
Now what I'm going to do is
I'm gonna cut you loose.

1736
01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.983
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

1737
01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:58.159
I'm going to let you
all handle this shit,

1738
01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:01.145
while I take this piece of shit
somewhere. Get your ass up.

1739
01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:03.679
Let's go. Walk!

1740
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:05.399
Good, because this was
getting ridiculous.

1741
01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:07.304
Thank you.

1742
01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:11.199
The hell are you looking at?

1743
01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:12.945
Nothing, Omar.

1744
01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.039
You can call me Omar now?

1745
01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:17.719
Can we just keep it moving?

1746
01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:21.502
I will not run a crew
without respect.

1747
01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:23.621
What?

1748
01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.981
I won't do it.

1749
01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:28.199
Get in here.

1750
01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.439
Let me tell you something.

1751
01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:31.759
Let me tell everybody in
here something right now.

1752
01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:34.506
It's about respect in this game!

1753
01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.719
I will not tolerate a crew
that does not respect me.

1754
01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:40.479
Respect is best served cold!

1755
01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:41.781
It's revenge!

1756
01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:45.866
Who said that?

1757
01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.546
Was that you?

1758
01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.986
Hmm?

1759
01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.509
Revenge is a dish

1760
01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.679
best served cold.

1761
01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:03.709
Oh!

1762
01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:08.864
Who in the hell are you?

1763
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.265
I'm Omar.

1764
01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.639
Who the hell are you?

1765
01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.385
What are you doing
in my warehouse?

1766
01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:17.439
What the hell's going on
here? Kill them both.

1767
01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.265
Fellas, please.

1768
01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:23.146
We don't want to
make Omar nervous.

1769
01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:38.599
Let me explain something to you.
Omar is very comfortable.

1770
01:12:38.600 --> 01:12:40.279
You know why?

1771
01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:43.026
Because Omar doesn't have a
bunch of guns pointed at him,

1772
01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:44.587
new guy.

1773
01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:47.399
I really don't mind that
you're pretending to be me,

1774
01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.479
whoever you are,

1775
01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:51.919
but what I do mind is
that any of these idiots

1776
01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:53.959
actually believe this clown!

1777
01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.740
Ask this guy right here
who he thinks Omar is.

1778
01:12:56.960 --> 01:12:59.119
I don't know, it just hurts.

1779
01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:00.279
You shot Roberto?

1780
01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.479
You damn right I shot him.

1781
01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.906
I'm impressed.

1782
01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.986
Problem is, if Omar
shoots Roberto...

1783
01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:11.319
Oh, shit!

1784
01:13:11.320 --> 01:13:12.959
Omar shoots Roberto.

1785
01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.599
I like you, little man.
You got balls.

1786
01:13:15.600 --> 01:13:18.107
So, you Omar!

1787
01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.066
Wait right there.

1788
01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.741
Damn, man!

1789
01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.911
You ain't what I pictured.

1790
01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:25.879
You ain't nothing
but a black dude.

1791
01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:27.479
Probably from Decatur.

1792
01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:32.799
That's what you get for thinking, James.
That really ain't your thing.

1793
01:13:32.800 --> 01:13:34.799
See, if you was thinking,

1794
01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:36.839
you'd get the big picture.
You'd see where you are.

1795
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:39.108
Look around you, James.
You see where you are?

1796
01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.199
You're in the middle of one
of the biggest arms deals

1797
01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.151
to ever go down in this town.
You could be in on it.

1798
01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:46.510
But you playing cops and robbers.

1799
01:13:46.680 --> 01:13:49.999
You think you been looking for
me, but I've been watching you.

1800
01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.559
I've been following you.

1801
01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.999
I've spent a lot of time, lot
of money thinking about you.

1802
01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.199
I spent so much money in fact,

1803
01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:57.479
your boys are now working for me.

1804
01:13:57.480 --> 01:13:59.145
Everything all right with
your packages, fellas?

1805
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:01.159
- Yes, sir.
- Come to the other side, man.

1806
01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:02.399
Let go of this self-respect shit.

1807
01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.239
Last I heard, it ain't buying
you a house in Florida.

1808
01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:07.079
See, everybody wants to be
on the winning side, James.

1809
01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.519
That's what I want for you.

1810
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.519
You out front, me in the shadows.

1811
01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.629
We could run this town.

1812
01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.199
Yeah, that's right,
I see you're curious.

1813
01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.559
I'm gonna make you this offer
one time, one last time.

1814
01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:20.350
What do you say?

1815
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.759
I'm Omar!

1816
01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:28.479
Shut up! Would you please stop!

1817
01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.959
Nobody believes you.

1818
01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:31.500
Get over there.

1819
01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:34.704
I'm gonna get with you later.

1820
01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.039
Come on now.

1821
01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:39.466
What's it gonna be?

1822
01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:42.279
Get your goddamn hands off me.

1823
01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:47.469
Well, I tried to put the
man in the penthouse.

1824
01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.159
He wants to spend his
life in the poorhouse.

1825
01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.269
Guess we'll have to reinstate
the death penalty.

1826
01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:55.159
You know what, Omar?
It really don't matter.

1827
01:14:55.160 --> 01:14:56.759
You could smoke me right here,

1828
01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.919
because we all gonna
die up in here anyway.

1829
01:14:58.920 --> 01:15:00.745
- Oh, are we?
- What are you talking about?

1830
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.391
You know what I'm talking about.

1831
01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.919
Your boy Marko told me everything.

1832
01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.319
It's a big setup.

1833
01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:07.919
Them boxes right there,

1834
01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.759
ain't nothing in
there but replicas.

1835
01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:10.839
Not true.

1836
01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:12.599
You ain't gonna like
how this movie end.

1837
01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:15.380
You just walked into
your own assassination.

1838
01:15:15.440 --> 01:15:18.823
We'll open the boxes and
find out, won't we?

1839
01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.110
- Which way do I go?
- Right here.

1840
01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:39.479
Yo, this is crazy, man!
This shit is crazy!

1841
01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.350
- Calm down!
- I can't calm down!

1842
01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.261
Holy shit! Oh, shit!

1843
01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:53.039
James, I see a gun!

1844
01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.341
Get it!

1845
01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:00.785
Shit! I got it! I got it!

1846
01:16:01.400 --> 01:16:04.799
Selective fire. Visual confirm
target. Short bursts.

1847
01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:06.399
Just shoot! Come on, here we go.

1848
01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.464
One, two, three, go!

1849
01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:13.639
Shit!

1850
01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:16.319
I thought it was the extended mags!
It's not the extended mags!

1851
01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.463
What you talking about?

1852
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:20.159
Shit, I'm out.

1853
01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.719
What the hell are you doing?

1854
01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:24.319
In a game, you can pick
up ammo off the ground!

1855
01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:26.239
This ain't no damn video game!

1856
01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:28.622
Hold on! I got one!

1857
01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.390
- Oh, God!
- Let's go!

1858
01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:38.185
Same thing on the count of three.

1859
01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.981
Watch out!

1860
01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:41.746
I just saved your life!

1861
01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:44.359
- Shit!
- I just saved your life!

1862
01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:45.479
Shit.

1863
01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.240
Save my life and get me
the hell out of here!

1864
01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:52.479
Yo, we can't go that way.

1865
01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:53.719
Why?

1866
01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:55.679
Because they got
AK-47s down there.

1867
01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:58.239
Two shotguns. They're
probably Benellis.

1868
01:16:58.240 --> 01:17:00.279
From the sound of it,
it might be AR-15 as well.

1869
01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:01.359
You can hear all that?

1870
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.439
It's from the game.

1871
01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:05.039
I got a perfect recall.
I'm a Platinum level player.

1872
01:17:05.040 --> 01:17:07.639
Here you go! Huh?
See how you like that!

1873
01:17:07.640 --> 01:17:09.544
- Call me the perfect storm.
- Grenade!

1874
01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:11.879
Hey, what you doing?

1875
01:17:11.880 --> 01:17:13.839
You got five seconds to pick
it up and throw it back.

1876
01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:15.187
Oh!

1877
01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:24.919
Stop throwing the
goddamn grenades!

1878
01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:27.188
I already pulled the pin.

1879
01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:29.021
Another one!

1880
01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:35.239
James, the money.

1881
01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.780
Ben! Get your ass back here!

1882
01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.985
It's gonna blow!
Let's get out of here!

1883
01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.786
Oh!

1884
01:17:51.240 --> 01:17:52.839
- You all right?
- I'm good.

1885
01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:54.141
Okay.

1886
01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.427
That's it?

1887
01:17:59.440 --> 01:18:02.061
That's not so bad. I thought it
was going to be bigger than that.

1888
01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.759
Damn!

1889
01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.266
My Car!

1890
01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:25.239
It's probably still
drivable though,

1891
01:18:25.240 --> 01:18:26.746
because it happened in the back.

1892
01:18:31.880 --> 01:18:33.466
You can't drive it now.

1893
01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.639
Yeah, it's definitely not
drivable. At first it was,

1894
01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:38.307
but after this, there's
no way you can drive it.

1895
01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:41.319
We have to get out
of here. Come on.

1896
01:18:41.320 --> 01:18:43.119
You wanna get a cab, or what?

1897
01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:44.785
- Let's go.
- Okay. All right.

1898
01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.559
So, what was Omar going to do
with all those guns anyway?

1899
01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:50.359
Probably start an army
and take over the city.

1900
01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:52.159
He's got half the
cops on his side.

1901
01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:53.461
So, we stopped him?

1902
01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:55.079
For now.

1903
01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.519
- Hey.
- What?

1904
01:18:56.520 --> 01:18:58.159
Slow down, man.

1905
01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.959
You see I got the money, right?

1906
01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:01.039
Yeah, that was good.

1907
01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.388
Hold this. My sock is wet.

1908
01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:06.039
Must have stepped in
a puddle or something.

1909
01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:07.751
Hate it when that happen.

1910
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:09.541
What is that?

1911
01:19:11.960 --> 01:19:13.639
Damn. You shot.

1912
01:19:13.640 --> 01:19:15.959
I think I would be able
to feel if I got shot.

1913
01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:18.959
You got so much adrenaline going
through you, you don't feel it.

1914
01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.386
But I'm serious.

1915
01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.919
- Wow.
- What?

1916
01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.301
It went straight through.

1917
01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.999
Oh, my God!

1918
01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.919
There's a hole in my leg!

1919
01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:29.079
I got shot!

1920
01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.279
Yeah I was pretty clear on that.

1921
01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.959
Oh, shit! It hurts now!

1922
01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:35.399
All right. Sit yourself
down. Sit down.

1923
01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.439
I ain't gonna sit down!
I just got shot!

1924
01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:39.105
I can't feel my toes!

1925
01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:40.679
I can't feel my toes!

1926
01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:42.266
Shh! Give me your belt.

1927
01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:44.439
You gonna whip me
because I got shot?

1928
01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:46.479
- Tourniquet!
- Okay.

1929
01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.719
You have to get a cold piece
of meat like a steak.

1930
01:19:49.720 --> 01:19:51.279
You have to put a
steak on it, man.

1931
01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.820
- Listen!
- I'm listening.

1932
01:19:53.160 --> 01:19:54.959
- I got shot!
- You're gonna be okay.

1933
01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:57.759
You lost a little blood. Just
have to get you to a hospital.

1934
01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.039
- Anybody down here?
- Calm down!

1935
01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.119
All right, calm. I'm calm.

1936
01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.159
Yeah.

1937
01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.399
Hey, Lieutenant, we
got a problem here.

1938
01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:11.199
I'm aware. Make this easy
on us, James. Come on in.

1939
01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:12.399
<i>Wait, what are you talking about?</i>

1940
01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:15.759
Listen, Santiago and
Miggs, they dirty.

1941
01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:18.427
Funny, they're saying
the same thing about you.

1942
01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:21.159
<i>They got Marko and his
buddy backing them up.</i>

1943
01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:22.239
What?

1944
01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:23.319
Hey! Tell him I got shot.

1945
01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:24.719
- Shut up.
- Okay.

1946
01:20:24.720 --> 01:20:27.399
Lieutenant, you gotta believe me,
it didn't go down like that.

1947
01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:29.319
<i>You know I'm on your side.
Come in, James.</i>

1948
01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:31.588
Just don't make it any worse.
Where are you?

1949
01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:34.119
My foot, I think the
tourniquet too tight.

1950
01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:35.279
We already at worse.

1951
01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:36.661
Is the ambulance coming?

1952
01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.431
- Is it coming?
- No.

1953
01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:40.719
And we can't call one either.

1954
01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:42.319
They'll be all over the scanners.

1955
01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.951
What does that mean?

1956
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.465
It means I'm on my own.

1957
01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:48.519
You're not on your own.

1958
01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:49.901
You got me, man.

1959
01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:53.959
Let's get you to a hospital.

1960
01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.308
Okay. Oh, shit.

1961
01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.583
Stop the car. Stop!

1962
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:07.439
Sorry to inform you, sir, but
I have to confiscate your vehicle.

1963
01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:08.999
That's not even a real badge.

1964
01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.399
I'm a police officer,
I need you to get out.

1965
01:21:11.400 --> 01:21:14.146
How you gonna carjack
me without a gun?

1966
01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.510
You right. Get your ass out.

1967
01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:20.199
Watch the sweater, man!
Watch the sweater, man!

1968
01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:21.706
<i>Hold on to your weed!</i>

1969
01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:24.599
<i>Firefighters are still
battling a nasty blaze</i>

1970
01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:28.799
<i>here at an abandoned warehouse in the
Old Fourth Ward district of Atlanta.</i>

1971
01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:30.431
Who cares?

1972
01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:44.519
Let's start two bags of O neg.

1973
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.359
Let me know when the
next OR's available.

1974
01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:48.439
- James, take my hand.
- Ain't happening.

1975
01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:49.787
James, please.

1976
01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:51.879
Here, call Angela.

1977
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.959
Tell her I love her.
Tell her I love her so much.

1978
01:21:53.960 --> 01:21:55.079
She sent you a text.

1979
01:21:55.080 --> 01:21:56.984
- What she say? Read it to me.
- It says...

1980
01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:00.999
"Come home soon."

1981
01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.301
"Come home soon"?

1982
01:22:02.680 --> 01:22:03.879
Oh, my God!

1983
01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:05.261
It's okay. Keep going.

1984
01:22:05.440 --> 01:22:08.346
James, what if
I never see her again?

1985
01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:09.919
Where's the doctor at?

1986
01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.079
I'm right here.

1987
01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:12.719
- Doc, am I dying?
- You're not dying.

1988
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:13.879
No, seriously.

1989
01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:15.559
- What's going on, James?
- What's going on?

1990
01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:18.519
It's complicated. I know you
supposed to call this in,

1991
01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:19.919
but I need you to hold off on that.

1992
01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.759
Doc, I'm losing breath,
I think I need some CCs.

1993
01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:24.479
I want you to buy me some time,

1994
01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:27.239
so we can make sure that
the one that did this

1995
01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:29.110
don't come back and
finish the job.

1996
01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.344
- You feel me?
- Okay.

1997
01:22:31.360 --> 01:22:33.599
Your buddy lost some blood, so I'll
give him something for the pain.

1998
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:35.399
We'll get him in the
next OR that opens up.

1999
01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:37.270
I appreciate it, Doc.

2000
01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:39.519
Nurse, start him on some
morphine, dress that wound,

2001
01:22:39.520 --> 01:22:41.159
and let me know when
the next OR opens up.

2002
01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:43.906
James, should we give him
some of the money we took?

2003
01:22:47.040 --> 01:22:48.399
I don't know what
he's talking about.

2004
01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.919
You know what I'm talking
about. The money.

2005
01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.919
- We good here, Doc.
- WWJD?

2006
01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.870
Shut the fuck up!

2007
01:22:54.920 --> 01:22:56.319
<i>Lathered Lotus, what's your twenty?</i>

2008
01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.559
I found the entrance to the prison
door, I'm taking heavy fire.

2009
01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.439
Assface23, take out
that machine gunner.

2010
01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:01.519
<i>Negative. Too hot.</i>

2011
01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:03.239
If you actually want to win,
you have to listen to me.

2012
01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.039
- <i>All right.</i>
- This is not a game.

2013
01:23:05.040 --> 01:23:06.559
<i>It is actually.</i>

2014
01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:09.679
Shit! Someone lay down suppressing
fire. I have to answer my door.

2015
01:23:09.680 --> 01:23:11.186
<i>You are go for door.</i>

2016
01:23:12.920 --> 01:23:14.159
Who is it?

2017
01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:16.359
Angela, it's Santiago and Miggs.

2018
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:18.039
Can you do me a favor,
can you open up?

2019
01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:19.865
I need to talk to
you for a second.

2020
01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.999
What happened? Is everything okay?

2021
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:23.199
- How are you doing?
- Good.

2022
01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:24.319
Can we come in for a second?

2023
01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.519
Sure. Sure.

2024
01:23:25.520 --> 01:23:27.319
We're just looking for James
and your boyfriend.

2025
01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:28.679
They're not here by
any chance, are they?

2026
01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:31.039
No, I haven't heard from
James or Ben in a while.

2027
01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.839
Is everything okay?

2028
01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:35.586
For you, no.

2029
01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:38.439
Wait, did you guys just hear that?

2030
01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:40.759
Yeah, what the hell was that?
What should we do?

2031
01:23:40.760 --> 01:23:42.639
We should finish
the game, assholes.

2032
01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:44.359
No. Listen closely.

2033
01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.424
<i>Miggs and Santiago, get out!</i>

2034
01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:48.545
You can't hear that?

2035
01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.221
Yeah, something's wrong.

2036
01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.546
Can I ask you a question?

2037
01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:03.187
How many rainbows are
you made out of?

2038
01:24:03.240 --> 01:24:08.479
Because right now, I can see
one, two, three trainbows.

2039
01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:12.342
I just said "trainbows."

2040
01:24:13.280 --> 01:24:15.264
- You know what, Ben?
- Hmm?

2041
01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.359
I read you all wrong.

2042
01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:20.584
What are you talking
about, you "read" me?

2043
01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.639
Me and Angela had it rough.

2044
01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.750
Moving from foster
home to foster home.

2045
01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:30.021
It was right after
our parents died.

2046
01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:32.719
It was hard, man.

2047
01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:34.943
I didn't trust nobody with Angela.

2048
01:24:34.960 --> 01:24:37.149
Can't nobody protect her like me.

2049
01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:39.782
It was how I used to think.

2050
01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.959
It's hard to change, you know.

2051
01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:45.421
Mmm.

2052
01:24:45.960 --> 01:24:48.639
It's okay. It's fine.

2053
01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.021
Nah.

2054
01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.543
I need to trust her a
little more, you know.

2055
01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:55.790
She a big girl.

2056
01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.744
She know how to
pick the right guy.

2057
01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:01.581
Wow.

2058
01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:04.439
Oh!

2059
01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:06.319
That is it right there.

2060
01:25:06.320 --> 01:25:09.624
That's why I made it my ring
tone, because I like it.

2061
01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.199
How do you answer this thing?
You have to slide it.

2062
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:13.639
Those things are crazy.

2063
01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:15.119
It's your buddy, Assface.

2064
01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:17.879
Assface? You have to answer that.

2065
01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.239
I can't wait for you to meet
Assface. You gonna love him.

2066
01:25:20.240 --> 01:25:21.359
Hello?

2067
01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.479
I need to speak to
the Black Hammer.

2068
01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.119
No, he can't talk right now.
He's a little incapacitated.

2069
01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.639
Ain't nobody constipated.

2070
01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:29.021
What's this pertaining to?

2071
01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.679
I think there's
trouble at his house.

2072
01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:31.999
- What?
- <i>I heard shouting.</i>

2073
01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.199
When?

2074
01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:34.319
<i>Just now, from Angela.</i>

2075
01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:35.719
How many voices did you hear?

2076
01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:36.999
<i>Two. Miggs and Santiago.</i>

2077
01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:38.199
Are you sure those were the names?

2078
01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.399
<i>Yes.</i>

2079
01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.701
Thank you, Assface.

2080
01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:43.639
Oh, my God, what happened?

2081
01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:45.519
You look like a monster right now.

2082
01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.319
Miggs and Santiago, they got
Angela at your house.

2083
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.919
What? Oh, no!

2084
01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.439
Sit back down. You on
meds. You can't move.

2085
01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.279
No, listen to me. This is
what we gonna do. Listen.

2086
01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:59.679
You gonna help me up.
And you and me, and him.

2087
01:25:59.680 --> 01:26:01.759
We have to take him with us.

2088
01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:04.599
The three of us, we gonna go
over there and kick some ass.

2089
01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:07.239
I can't have nothing happen
to you. Angela would kill me.

2090
01:26:07.240 --> 01:26:10.279
After all we been through today,
you still don't trust me?

2091
01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:12.628
Man, you still under...

2092
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:14.039
Have you seen these guys?

2093
01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.387
No. Nothing.

2094
01:26:16.920 --> 01:26:18.585
Are you sure?

2095
01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.870
- Come on, we have to get there.
- Come on.

2096
01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.919
We have to get... Oh, shit!

2097
01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.222
Oh, you should have
helped me, James.

2098
01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.519
Are my lips chapped?

2099
01:26:35.600 --> 01:26:36.639
Yeah.

2100
01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.759
<i>James, my man.</i>

2101
01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:40.039
I'm here with your boys
Santiago and Miggs.

2102
01:26:40.040 --> 01:26:41.626
Got somebody who wants
to holler at you.

2103
01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:44.519
There are three of them and
they're armed. Don't touch me!

2104
01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:46.319
I'm gonna tell you
something, if you touch her,

2105
01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:48.959
I'm peeling your wig back,
you understand me?

2106
01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:51.279
Ooh! Ooh! Threats. Threats.

2107
01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.639
<i>I know how you look now.</i>

2108
01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.119
I done seen your face.

2109
01:26:54.120 --> 01:26:56.279
<i>Keep talking, baby sister
ain't gonna make it.</i>

2110
01:26:56.280 --> 01:26:57.319
<i>What's it gonna be, James?</i>

2111
01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.479
What do you want?

2112
01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:01.943
What do I want? I want my money.

2113
01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.959
- Yeah, I got it.
- <i>Yeah, come on, man,</i>

2114
01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:06.039
you gotta hurry up before
we get started without you.

2115
01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:08.263
We be there in 30 minutes.

2116
01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.879
But we right around the corner.

2117
01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:11.479
Exactly, but they don't know that.

2118
01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:14.999
Right. They just unlocked
the Platinum level player.

2119
01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.639
Ain't gonna be no cheat codes.

2120
01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:18.919
I need you to stay focused.
Follow the plan.

2121
01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:20.799
- I'm focused.
- Timing gotta be on point.

2122
01:27:20.800 --> 01:27:22.039
Okay.

2123
01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.319
I'll need you to come in fast.

2124
01:27:23.320 --> 01:27:25.384
We gonna get their ass. Mmm!

2125
01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.159
Don't touch me.

2126
01:27:36.160 --> 01:27:38.827
I could make you so happy.

2127
01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.267
Hey. Go check that out.

2128
01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:21.879
- Damn it, I missed him.
- Ben?

2129
01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:23.705
- You again?
- Where you at?

2130
01:28:25.480 --> 01:28:27.719
I'm high as a kite.
I can't feel none of this.

2131
01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.399
- Get off of him.
- James!

2132
01:28:29.400 --> 01:28:30.701
Omar, freeze!

2133
01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:37.559
- James!
- You better have my money.

2134
01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.861
Get off of me.

2135
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.439
Stop!

2136
01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:45.549
Come here! Come here!

2137
01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.341
Ben!

2138
01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.501
No!

2139
01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:58.221
I'll be with you in a sec, babe.
It didn't even hurt.

2140
01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:01.999
Black Hammer!

2141
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.223
Bring my sister into this?

2142
01:29:05.680 --> 01:29:08.631
After everything I did for you!
Get up! Get your ass up.

2143
01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:12.229
You are gonna respect me.

2144
01:29:13.680 --> 01:29:15.869
Okay, listen. I'm not trying to...

2145
01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.119
Bitch!

2146
01:29:21.040 --> 01:29:22.159
Ben!

2147
01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:24.030
You want some more?

2148
01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.679
I'm sorry, I just
made a huge mistake.

2149
01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:27.141
It's too late for that.

2150
01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:28.821
No!

2151
01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:35.344
Get off me. Get your hands...

2152
01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.229
Ahh!

2153
01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:47.159
How does it feel to be on
the other side now, huh?

2154
01:29:47.160 --> 01:29:49.079
You always think you're
better than everybody,

2155
01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:51.919
getting all your citations.
Looking down at all of us?

2156
01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:53.949
How does it feel now, huh?

2157
01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.479
Do it.

2158
01:29:56.480 --> 01:29:57.719
Get away from my brother!

2159
01:29:57.720 --> 01:29:59.909
- Son of a...
- Great, baby!

2160
01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:02.424
Ang, behind you.

2161
01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.821
James!

2162
01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:21.270
James!

2163
01:30:23.280 --> 01:30:25.079
Girl, you better bring your little

2164
01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:26.919
narrow ass on before
you make me mad!

2165
01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.399
- James!
- Come on with me.

2166
01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.679
No!

2167
01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.919
Get off of me!

2168
01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:33.063
- Omar!
- James!

2169
01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.639
Let her go, man!

2170
01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:37.399
Damn, James, you
disappoint me, man.

2171
01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.999
Make you a nice offer. Nice offer!

2172
01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:42.039
You got to turn me down.

2173
01:30:42.040 --> 01:30:43.679
You know I don't like
to be disappointed.

2174
01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.599
That's all right, you
stopped this deal,

2175
01:30:45.600 --> 01:30:47.799
but there's always
another deal to be made.

2176
01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.319
I'm accepting your offer now.

2177
01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:50.479
Now?

2178
01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:55.919
No. Now, you gonna do
what I tell you to do.

2179
01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:57.719
You gonna put your
gun down, you gonna

2180
01:30:57.720 --> 01:30:59.359
watch me drive off
with your sister.

2181
01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:00.839
That's what's happening now.

2182
01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:02.199
You know I can't do that.

2183
01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:03.279
How about now?

2184
01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:04.706
Huh?

2185
01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:06.479
What's it gonna be, James?

2186
01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.639
Shoot him, James!

2187
01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:10.879
You shut your little ass up.
Just keep your narrow ass still.

2188
01:31:10.880 --> 01:31:13.999
Girl, you don't hold still
you gonna make me...

2189
01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.239
- What? What?
- No.

2190
01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.359
Come on, James.

2191
01:31:16.360 --> 01:31:17.599
Huh?

2192
01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:18.879
Trust me.

2193
01:31:18.880 --> 01:31:20.599
Clock's ticking!

2194
01:31:20.600 --> 01:31:21.947
What's it gonna be?

2195
01:31:24.360 --> 01:31:26.399
All right. Whoa.

2196
01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:28.039
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

2197
01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:30.319
Oh, now you want to
get some act right.

2198
01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.919
I'm putting it down.

2199
01:31:31.920 --> 01:31:33.585
Oh, now you're putting
it down, okay!

2200
01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:41.781
Bye, James.

2201
01:31:44.880 --> 01:31:46.306
Kick move.

2202
01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.261
How do you like that end?

2203
01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.661
Damn.

2204
01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:03.039
Game over, bitch.

2205
01:32:03.040 --> 01:32:05.159
- Oh...
- He getting up.

2206
01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:06.519
James...

2207
01:32:06.520 --> 01:32:08.239
James, you got him, right?

2208
01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:09.479
Let's move.

2209
01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:12.479
I didn't even realize I got shot
till we left the warehouse.

2210
01:32:12.480 --> 01:32:13.559
But I didn't panic, though.

2211
01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.021
Here comes the lieutenant.

2212
01:32:15.880 --> 01:32:17.119
So, now what are you going to do?

2213
01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.199
What you mean?

2214
01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:21.743
Well, after three years and all that
overtime, you finally got your man.

2215
01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.471
I didn't get my man.

2216
01:32:23.720 --> 01:32:25.146
We got our man.

2217
01:32:27.600 --> 01:32:28.879
I never liked those two.

2218
01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.306
Hmm.

2219
01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:32.781
What?

2220
01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.501
No, I'm not going
to say it. I'm not.

2221
01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:37.743
No. I'll see you at the office.

2222
01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:41.319
Did you see that?

2223
01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:42.439
Actually, I didn't.

2224
01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.959
You didn't see the look
that he just gave me?

2225
01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.910
- No.
- That was a look of respect, James.

2226
01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.839
I didn't even tell
you when they was

2227
01:32:47.840 --> 01:32:49.559
shooting at the warehouse
what I was doing.

2228
01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:52.386
Everybody's all over the place,
but I'm locked in on Omar...

2229
01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.466
Omar.

2230
01:32:55.920 --> 01:32:57.221
For the record,

2231
01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:00.467
I would've never taken your offer.

2232
01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:03.399
See, you always missing
the big picture, James.

2233
01:33:03.400 --> 01:33:05.199
Yeah, but I ain't
gonna miss your ass.

2234
01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.759
Oh.

2235
01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.949
Get his ass out of here.

2236
01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:28.628
Ben held his own, huh?

2237
01:33:30.240 --> 01:33:32.383
Did he impress you enough?

2238
01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.879
We didn't get ourselves killed.

2239
01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.342
So I guess he did all right.

2240
01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:41.823
That was your approval.

2241
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.999
You just gave me your blessing.
Did you hear that, Ang?

2242
01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.959
James, you just gave me
your blessing just now.

2243
01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:50.959
James, don't you walk...
Come here, James.

2244
01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:53.279
Baby, you gotta help me because
this morphine done worn off.

2245
01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:54.959
This shit hurts. James!

2246
01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.786
I can't chase you because of my
leg, but I wanna give you a hug.

2247
01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:09.380
Look at this, ladies.
He has amazing taste.

2248
01:34:09.560 --> 01:34:10.941
Great taste, right?

2249
01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:13.639
No. Hey...

2250
01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:14.879
Just hold on.

2251
01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.479
I need you at least 15 feet away
from this grill at all times.

2252
01:34:17.480 --> 01:34:18.999
James, please don't start.

2253
01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.639
I can't even believe you over here,
man, after what you did to me.

2254
01:34:21.640 --> 01:34:23.319
What I did to you
was not my fault.

2255
01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:25.119
- You set me on fire!
- You know what?

2256
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.079
On my phone I can go to a website,

2257
01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:30.159
and this website will give me
instructions on how to use this machine.

2258
01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:31.479
You're not using my grill.
Back off.

2259
01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:32.879
Give me your Wi-Fi password.

2260
01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:34.386
- No.
- Let me get your wee-fee.

2261
01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:36.146
Give me the wee-fee!

2262
01:34:37.200 --> 01:34:39.104
Suspect-shot-23.

2263
01:34:39.480 --> 01:34:41.959
There's so many other passwords
that you could have chose.

2264
01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:43.910
Airplane. Bike.

2265
01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:45.719
It's too much, man.

2266
01:34:45.720 --> 01:34:47.839
I'm in, watch out. Let me do it.

2267
01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.559
- Move. No.
- James.

2268
01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:52.039
Come on. Stop it.
This is unnecessary.

2269
01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:53.199
This is stupid.

2270
01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.919
- No, get back.
- Will you trust me!

2271
01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.239
I'm a man that's weeks away from
graduating from the police academy.

2272
01:34:58.240 --> 01:34:59.905
Dude, this is symbolic.

2273
01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:03.439
- All right.
- Thank you.

2274
01:35:03.440 --> 01:35:04.599
But you gotta turn the gas on...

2275
01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:06.519
I turned the gas on
five minutes ago!

2276
01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:14.382
I'm all right, Angela!

2277
01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:16.399
I'm okay.

2278
01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:18.839
Hey, James, you should give
your neighbors a call,

2279
01:35:18.840 --> 01:35:21.199
because I think I killed their
dog when I came in hot.

2280
01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:23.399
I might have second-degree
burns, people.

2281
01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:25.079
Let's just say
third-degree to be safe

2282
01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:27.621
because my chest is
blistering up as we speak.
