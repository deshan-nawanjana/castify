WEBVTT

00:00:36.662 --> 00:00:39.664
Through the years,
I have been known by many names.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.376
Diablo Gato.

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:45.962
The Furry Lover.

00:00:46.547 --> 00:00:48.381
Chupacabra.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:51.050
Friskie Two-Times.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.386
And the Ginger Hit Man.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.766
But to most... I am Puss In Boots!

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:01.561
Outlaw.

00:01:34.928 --> 00:01:38.264
I will never forget you... Margherita.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.767
I mean, Rosa.

00:01:42.477 --> 00:01:44.979
Sorry. I think maybe I should go.

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.646
You cannot run forever,

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:28.981
Puss In Boots!

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.325
What can I say? I was a bad kitty.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.334
Just a fugitive from the law...
forever running.

00:02:48.502 --> 00:02:52.088
Searching for a way to clear my name.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.009
And I would get that chance...

00:02:57.969 --> 00:03:01.013
...on this one fateful night.

00:03:49.062 --> 00:03:51.230
Here, kitty, kitty!

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:54.900
Raoul.

00:03:55.736 --> 00:03:57.737
Look what the cat dragged in.

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.906
Oh, wait... That is the cat!

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:07.246
One leche, please.

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:15.087
What are you doing here, señor?
Did you lose your ball of yarn?

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.302
So funny.

00:04:21.762 --> 00:04:23.596
One leche coming up.

00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:39.779
I am not looking for trouble.

00:04:45.452 --> 00:04:48.788
I am but a humble gato
in search of his next meal.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.416
Perhaps you gentlemen
can help me find a simple score?

00:04:52.876 --> 00:04:57.463
The only thing you'll find tonight
is trouble... Puss In Boots.

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:12.311
Well, perhaps if one of us were to
tell the law that you are in town,

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:14.814
we could split the reward.

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:26.617
You made the cat angry.

00:05:26.785 --> 00:05:29.829
You do not want to make the cat angry!

00:05:32.332 --> 00:05:35.084
The Church of St. Michael
has just put up a golden statue

00:05:35.252 --> 00:05:36.669
of the Virgin of Guadalupe.

00:05:36.837 --> 00:05:38.671
I do not steal from churches.

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.757
The boys' orphanage has been donated
silver candlesticks,

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.551
they would look very lovely
in your home.

00:05:43.718 --> 00:05:45.553
I do not steal from orphans.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.680
What about Jack and Jill?

00:05:47.848 --> 00:05:50.850
- Shh! Are you crazy?
- The what?

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:57.439
The murderous outlaws Jack and Jill

00:05:57.607 --> 00:06:00.609
have gotten their hands on...
magic beans.

00:06:00.777 --> 00:06:03.237
Do not joke with me about magic beans!

00:06:03.405 --> 00:06:07.908
I searched half my life for them.
They do not exist.

00:06:08.076 --> 00:06:11.245
No, cat. We have seen them.

00:06:11.413 --> 00:06:15.583
These... are the beans of legend.

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:21.505
Grows a vine to the Land of Giants,

00:06:21.673 --> 00:06:24.425
and the Golden Goose.

00:06:24.593 --> 00:06:26.176
The Golden Goose...

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.263
A heist like this
could set you up for life.

00:06:29.431 --> 00:06:31.265
All nine of them.

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:33.559
Show him the golden eggs.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:35.102
No!

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.063
Please, you have shown enough.

00:06:38.231 --> 00:06:43.110
Only a cat with a death wish would
steal the beans from Jack and Jill.

00:06:44.821 --> 00:06:49.783
The only wish I have
is to repay an old debt.

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:51.952
And this is my chance.

00:06:53.079 --> 00:06:54.455
Now...

00:06:55.582 --> 00:06:57.625
...where do I find this Jack and Jill?

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:35.621
I'm sorry... we have no rooms.

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:43.212
Well, I think one just opened up.

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:50.678
We'd like a complimentary
continental breakfast.

00:07:50.845 --> 00:07:54.223
And don't even think about skimpin'
on them baby muffins.

00:08:02.023 --> 00:08:04.858
We don't have any baby muffins.

00:08:10.031 --> 00:08:11.323
You know, Jill...

00:08:12.033 --> 00:08:13.617
...I been thinking.

00:08:13.868 --> 00:08:15.035
Get it out.

00:08:15.203 --> 00:08:19.206
I... Once we're done
with this magic bean business

00:08:19.374 --> 00:08:22.543
and got ourselves
all them beautiful golden eggs...

00:08:22.877 --> 00:08:24.044
Go on.

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:27.965
...that we cut down on some
of the hijacking and murdering.

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:30.718
I mean, it's fun and all, but...

00:08:33.054 --> 00:08:35.097
...I want a baby.

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.563
A baby what, Jack?

00:08:42.814 --> 00:08:47.276
A baby us, Jill. We'll raise it wild,
like a squirrel or something.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.030
Holy frijoles!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.032
They do exist.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.951
Ever since you fell down that hill
and broke your crown,

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.619
you have been talking crazy.

00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.627
It couldn't hurt to have
an extra shooter during ambushes.

00:09:05.795 --> 00:09:09.006
Maybe I cut too deep...
cut that brain out of your head.

00:09:10.341 --> 00:09:12.926
Hey! What gives?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.222
If it's to be a girl,
she'll have your strong...

00:09:17.390 --> 00:09:19.433
No! No! No!

00:09:19.601 --> 00:09:22.644
You, you, you! You stop where you are!

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:26.565
I don't know, Jack. How do I ride and
shoot with a baby slung on my back?

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:30.110
They got them backpacks now.
The way I see it, Jill...

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.113
Those beans are mine!

00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:36.658
...we fall off this flat earth one time.
What better proof of our love...

00:09:36.826 --> 00:09:37.826
Me?

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.705
You snap me?

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.459
You snap me?!

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.307
You looking for something?

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:07.314
No.

00:10:07.482 --> 00:10:09.608
No hablo inglés.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:16.532
You are going to pay for this!

00:10:48.857 --> 00:10:51.316
No!

00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.949
Chupacabra!

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:00.951
Chupacabra! Chupacabra!

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:03.537
- Chupacabra!
- You are a crazy woman!

00:11:58.009 --> 00:12:00.594
Those magic beans were my score!

00:12:00.762 --> 00:12:03.847
You just cost me a chance
at getting the golden eggs, mi amigo.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:06.099
Put up your dukes.

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.396
Very well.

00:12:52.563 --> 00:12:54.356
If it is to be a dance fight,

00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.901
then I will Tuesday-Night-Dance-Fight
you to the death!

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:22.175
How dare you do the Litter Box at me!

00:13:23.511 --> 00:13:25.137
Hello!

00:13:48.202 --> 00:13:49.911
Can you feel me?

00:14:51.599 --> 00:14:53.934
Fear me... if you dare.

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.135
You hit me in the head with a guitar?!

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:30.220
You are a woman?

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.186
Amateur.

00:15:39.147 --> 00:15:40.564
Wow!

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.942
Señorita, wait!

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:50.991
Let me buy you some leche!
I am a lover, not a fighter.

00:15:54.662 --> 00:15:56.246
Hello?

00:15:56.414 --> 00:15:59.291
You are hiding from me?

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:02.043
I like to play the games, too.

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:07.257
I sense in you a kindred spirit, a...

00:16:10.303 --> 00:16:13.263
I smell something familiar.

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:18.185
Something... dangerous.

00:16:19.395 --> 00:16:20.729
Something...

00:16:21.147 --> 00:16:22.814
...breakfasty.

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.234
It's been a long time, brother.

00:16:30.364 --> 00:16:31.948
Maldito huevo.

00:16:35.578 --> 00:16:39.247
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

00:16:40.082 --> 00:16:42.417
How dare you show your face to me.

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:47.088
I know you're angry.
You have every right.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:50.759
But it is good to see you, Puss.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.344
Are those new boots?

00:16:52.512 --> 00:16:57.098
No! They are the same boots I wore
when you betrayed me.

00:16:57.934 --> 00:16:59.684
Betrayed you?

00:16:59.852 --> 00:17:03.313
You left me cracked in pieces
on a bridge, surrounded by soldiers!

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:04.731
They wrote a song about it!

00:17:04.899 --> 00:17:08.068
And how did we get on that bridge
in the first place?!

00:17:08.236 --> 00:17:11.112
Because we were brothers, and brothers
are supposed to look after each other...

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.447
Humpty!

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:16.701
Remember why we're here.

00:17:17.870 --> 00:17:19.371
I should have known.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:22.457
I had the magic beans in my grasp,

00:17:22.625 --> 00:17:27.295
and you sent this very attractive
devil woman to interfere.

00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:29.297
You are a curse on my life!

00:17:29.632 --> 00:17:31.049
Wait. Hear me out. OK?

00:17:31.217 --> 00:17:33.760
Yes, yes,
I sent Kitty to bring you here.

00:17:33.928 --> 00:17:36.096
But she is no ordinary thief.

00:17:37.807 --> 00:17:39.558
She's Kitty Softpaws.

00:17:39.725 --> 00:17:41.893
The softest touch in Spain.

00:17:42.061 --> 00:17:45.021
That's a lot of heel for a guy,
don't you think?

00:17:49.485 --> 00:17:51.987
Look, with Kitty's skill,
your sword and my brain,

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:53.738
we've got a fighting chance here.

00:17:53.906 --> 00:17:56.825
Puss, come on, you of all people
know that nobody's ever ripped off

00:17:56.993 --> 00:17:59.536
the giant's castle
and lived to tell the tale.

00:17:59.704 --> 00:18:01.955
You want to survive? You need a plan.

00:18:03.124 --> 00:18:07.502
And I've studied this job my whole life.
You know that.

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.796
Let's be honest.

00:18:09.964 --> 00:18:12.465
Without me, you don't even know
where to plant the beans, Puss.

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:15.885
But Jack and Jill do.
They're on their way.

00:18:17.305 --> 00:18:22.309
We go up the beanstalk outlaws,
and we come down legends.

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:26.313
So what do you say?

00:18:26.981 --> 00:18:28.315
Partners?

00:18:31.319 --> 00:18:33.987
No. Never again.

00:18:35.823 --> 00:18:39.492
I'm sorry, OK?
How long are you gonna hold a grudge?

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:43.830
It's been seven years!
That's like 35 cat years.

00:18:44.165 --> 00:18:47.500
You need me! And I need you.

00:18:49.253 --> 00:18:53.632
Puss! You got any idea what they do
to eggs in San Ricardo prison?

00:18:57.678 --> 00:19:00.013
I'll tell you this, my friend.

00:19:01.182 --> 00:19:03.016
It ain't over easy.

00:19:07.021 --> 00:19:10.690
Adiós... Humpty Dumpty.

00:19:16.989 --> 00:19:18.865
Oh, this is bad. This is bad.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:23.370
Don't worry, I'll take care of it.
I know how to speak meow.

00:19:23.704 --> 00:19:26.247
...sad story with your twisted lies

00:19:26.415 --> 00:19:29.292
in your greasy shell
that smells like old ham!

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.670
I should crack you open for...

00:19:42.556 --> 00:19:44.557
Look what I found.

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:48.561
Someone forgot his money.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:54.734
Oh, you are dangerous.

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.654
Humpty says you like danger.

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:04.494
Just think of all the trouble
we can get into.

00:20:07.248 --> 00:20:09.749
The two of us together.

00:20:09.917 --> 00:20:13.920
We can steal a lot of golden eggs.

00:20:20.094 --> 00:20:22.429
And... you owe me.

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:24.931
I owe you?

00:20:25.599 --> 00:20:28.101
You hit me in the head with a guitar.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:30.270
I regret the guitar.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:32.939
OK, I forgive you.

00:20:33.107 --> 00:20:35.442
So... you're in?

00:20:37.278 --> 00:20:41.781
There is one teeny, tiny,
itty-bitty problem.

00:20:41.949 --> 00:20:43.616
And what is that?

00:20:43.951 --> 00:20:46.786
You work for the egg!

00:20:47.496 --> 00:20:52.125
Come on, Puss. What happened between
you and Humpty that was so bad?

00:20:54.462 --> 00:20:57.130
I am afraid with me and Humpty...

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:00.425
...the scars are too deep.

00:21:04.972 --> 00:21:07.932
It all started a long time ago.

00:21:08.100 --> 00:21:10.894
Oh, no. You really don't have to tell me
your whole life story, please.

00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:12.896
You may want to sit.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:18.151
It is at times quite... painful.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:20.153
OK, here we go.

00:21:21.155 --> 00:21:24.657
It was a year
in which the rain had not fallen.

00:21:25.659 --> 00:21:29.162
The wind was big
and the basket was small.

00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:31.581
For days, I bounced along...

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:35.502
...a hungry little kitten
with no milk, no mama,

00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:37.504
and no litter box.

00:21:37.671 --> 00:21:42.175
Until I came to rest at a home
for lost children.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:52.685
Her name was Imelda.

00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:57.315
And, like a mother, she took me
into her heart and raised me as her own.

00:22:00.194 --> 00:22:03.738
Silencio.

00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:06.115
She was an angel of kindness.

00:22:06.283 --> 00:22:08.201
¡Silencio!

00:22:09.119 --> 00:22:10.453
Most of the time.

00:22:10.621 --> 00:22:14.207
I'd like to introduce
a new boy joining us.

00:22:14.375 --> 00:22:18.044
It's OK, pequeño.
You show with the face.

00:22:21.966 --> 00:22:23.299
Go on.

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:32.141
And that was the moment I met...

00:22:32.476 --> 00:22:34.269
Humpty Alexander Dumpty.

00:22:35.479 --> 00:22:38.857
Hey, Whiskers! You're sitting
in Little Boy Blue's chair.

00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.484
Oh, come on. Is this necessary?

00:22:41.652 --> 00:22:43.653
Why don't you pick on
somebody your own size?

00:22:43.821 --> 00:22:45.613
Who asked you, Breakfast?

00:22:45.781 --> 00:22:47.282
Remember what Imelda says, Boy Blue:

00:22:47.449 --> 00:22:50.535
If you're going to blow your top,
you blow your horn instead, right?

00:22:50.703 --> 00:22:51.953
Let's spin him.

00:22:52.121 --> 00:22:54.372
Please don't spin me. Do not spin me!

00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.958
Not again! No! I'm going to yolk!

00:22:57.126 --> 00:23:00.795
Even though he took my beans,
the egg stood up for me,

00:23:00.963 --> 00:23:02.755
and I decided then...

00:23:02.923 --> 00:23:05.341
...that I would always have his back.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:13.766
Wow!

00:23:14.018 --> 00:23:16.269
That was very impressive. Thanks!

00:23:17.271 --> 00:23:18.855
Hey, egg boy!

00:23:20.858 --> 00:23:25.862
There was something about this
strange little egg that intrigued me.

00:23:42.922 --> 00:23:46.257
Oh... it's you.
I've been collecting for months now.

00:23:46.425 --> 00:23:48.885
You never know when you're gonna
get lucky. You know what I mean?

00:23:50.554 --> 00:23:53.306
Magic beans... is what they are.

00:23:54.892 --> 00:23:55.934
Hello?

00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:58.895
You gonna tell all the other kids
that I believe in magic now?

00:23:59.063 --> 00:24:00.855
Is that what you're gonna do?

00:24:02.441 --> 00:24:04.484
No? What's your name?

00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.654
You don't say much, do you?

00:24:07.821 --> 00:24:10.239
I think I'll call you Sparky.

00:24:11.325 --> 00:24:12.575
Whiskers?

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:13.993
Zoltar!

00:24:15.996 --> 00:24:17.413
How about Puss?

00:24:18.874 --> 00:24:22.627
Humpty's mind
was full of imagination and invention.

00:24:22.795 --> 00:24:24.420
What is that, 50 feet down there?

00:24:24.588 --> 00:24:27.131
Here we go. Give me a...

00:24:27.299 --> 00:24:29.008
Puss!

00:24:30.552 --> 00:24:33.721
Look at me, Puss! I'm flying!

00:24:36.225 --> 00:24:40.353
He spoke of legends and adventures
beyond my wildest dreams.

00:24:40.521 --> 00:24:43.898
When I find those magic beans,
they'll grow a vine

00:24:44.066 --> 00:24:46.150
straight up into the clouds,

00:24:46.318 --> 00:24:50.655
where a terrible and a fearsome giant
hoards his greatest treasure...

00:24:51.198 --> 00:24:53.324
...the Golden Goose.

00:24:53.492 --> 00:24:55.785
Oh, the Golden Goose. Just one.

00:24:55.953 --> 00:25:00.581
Just one of her golden eggs...
could set me for life.

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:03.251
It's my destiny, Puss.

00:25:03.419 --> 00:25:08.423
I can't really explain it,
but I just feel like I belong up there.

00:25:13.262 --> 00:25:15.596
Oh, boy. This is awkward.

00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:18.766
This is kind of a solo dream here.

00:25:19.601 --> 00:25:22.770
I don't need any dead weight,
you know, holding me down.

00:25:24.523 --> 00:25:25.898
What are you doing?

00:25:26.692 --> 00:25:31.571
Oh, man, that's good. The eye thing that
you're doing, that is really splendid.

00:25:31.739 --> 00:25:35.616
OK, let me just think for a second.
All right... OK.

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.202
This is crazy, but...

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:41.539
...I am considering a partnership.

00:25:43.208 --> 00:25:45.043
I just need to know one thing.

00:25:45.961 --> 00:25:47.420
Can you commit?

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.797
Sí... I can commit.

00:25:49.965 --> 00:25:53.384
Oh, you can talk!
Could you help me up?

00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:56.971
OK...

00:25:58.724 --> 00:26:00.141
First rule of Bean Club...

00:26:01.643 --> 00:26:04.479
...you do not talk about Bean Club.

00:26:05.064 --> 00:26:06.731
Second rule of Bean Club...

00:26:07.232 --> 00:26:10.943
...is you don't talk about Bean Club.
You ready?

00:26:11.111 --> 00:26:12.195
Ready.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:15.698
From this day forth,
it shall be known...

00:26:15.866 --> 00:26:19.035
Never alone, always together...

00:26:19.203 --> 00:26:20.536
Humpty and Puss...

00:26:20.788 --> 00:26:22.330
Brothers forever.

00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.791
And from that moment on,

00:26:24.958 --> 00:26:29.128
we were united on a great adventure
to find the magic beans.

00:26:29.296 --> 00:26:30.379
Help me up.

00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:32.048
Egg me.

00:26:32.341 --> 00:26:34.300
Humpty was the brains...

00:26:34.468 --> 00:26:36.928
- Good gracious!
- I never saw him!

00:26:37.137 --> 00:26:39.639
- That really hurt!
- ...and I was the skill.

00:26:40.557 --> 00:26:42.141
I'm cracked!

00:26:43.894 --> 00:26:49.065
We got red beans, green beans, coffee
beans, lima beans... but no magic beans.

00:26:50.484 --> 00:26:52.151
Would you care for a jelly bean?

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:53.486
Thank you.

00:26:54.071 --> 00:26:56.489
Finding them meant everything to us.

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.659
I almost forgot
the most important thing.

00:27:00.244 --> 00:27:01.911
That's me and you, Puss.

00:27:03.413 --> 00:27:04.914
Me and you.

00:27:05.082 --> 00:27:07.583
But we never did find them.

00:27:07.751 --> 00:27:11.003
And, as years passed,
the quest for magic beans

00:27:11.171 --> 00:27:15.424
seemed more and more
like the dreams of a child.

00:27:16.844 --> 00:27:20.513
As teenagers,
Humpty and I looked for trouble...

00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.849
...and often found it.

00:27:23.016 --> 00:27:27.186
Third time this month, Imelda.
Next time is jail time.

00:27:27.354 --> 00:27:29.564
They're just kids.

00:27:29.731 --> 00:27:32.358
They are thieves.

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.198
You are better than this.

00:27:39.366 --> 00:27:42.535
I believe in you with all my heart.

00:27:42.703 --> 00:27:45.454
Please do not let me down.

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:50.793
I hate this place.
I cannot wait for us to get out of here.

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:54.589
Throw a rock.
It'll make you feel better.

00:27:57.467 --> 00:27:58.634
Oh, boy. We should go.

00:28:01.138 --> 00:28:03.723
On instinct, I reacted.

00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:21.199
He saved the Comandante's mother!

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.665
You saved my mother.

00:28:29.833 --> 00:28:33.419
Señor Puss... he is a hero!

00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:41.093
Today we see that courage and bravery
come in all sizes!

00:28:41.428 --> 00:28:45.806
Little did I know that one moment
would change my whole life.

00:28:45.974 --> 00:28:48.559
These are for you, my boy.

00:28:49.228 --> 00:28:53.606
Wear them as a symbol of honor...
and justice.

00:28:53.774 --> 00:28:57.526
I will make you proud, Mama.

00:28:57.694 --> 00:29:02.740
You already have, my Puss In Boots.

00:29:05.035 --> 00:29:08.287
How strange it was
to give a cat boots...

00:29:08.455 --> 00:29:11.624
...but, whoa... I looked good!

00:29:11.792 --> 00:29:14.627
And as the light of my path
grew brighter...

00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:19.131
...Humpty's road grew ever darker.

00:29:25.555 --> 00:29:27.306
Gracias, Comandante.

00:29:27.474 --> 00:29:29.892
Be careful of the company you keep.

00:29:32.062 --> 00:29:35.064
I know! I know, I never should've
tried something without you.

00:29:35.232 --> 00:29:38.734
You're not stealing lollipops anymore,
Humpty. This is getting serious.

00:29:38.902 --> 00:29:41.279
You're right!
We have to be smarter about this.

00:29:41.446 --> 00:29:43.656
Here, look. We need to think bigger.

00:29:43.824 --> 00:29:46.575
I've been casing the silversmith
and it's perfect.

00:29:46.743 --> 00:29:49.203
You and me, in and out,
50 seconds tops.

00:29:49.371 --> 00:29:51.998
Will you put that away!
This is our home.

00:29:52.165 --> 00:29:54.792
These people have done nothing to us.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.421
Our home? OK, yeah, I get it now.

00:29:58.588 --> 00:30:02.008
You get some fancy boots
and now you're too good for me?

00:30:02.175 --> 00:30:03.551
That is not true.

00:30:03.719 --> 00:30:05.803
We weren't born here.
We're orphans!

00:30:05.971 --> 00:30:07.763
All we got is each other,
you understand?

00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:09.557
We are better than this.

00:30:10.976 --> 00:30:12.476
But we're partners.

00:30:12.644 --> 00:30:14.687
We are brothers.

00:30:15.689 --> 00:30:18.149
But I am not stealing anymore.

00:30:20.694 --> 00:30:23.446
But Humpty would not give up so easily.

00:30:24.031 --> 00:30:25.281
I'm in trouble, Puss!

00:30:25.449 --> 00:30:27.658
It's Boy Blue and his gang.
I owe them some money.

00:30:27.826 --> 00:30:30.036
They're coming for me.
Just get me over this wall.

00:30:30.329 --> 00:30:33.664
I gotta go. Help me up the wall.
Get me up the wall. Hurry! Hurry!

00:30:45.677 --> 00:30:47.970
OK, I've got everything. We did it.
Come on, let's go!

00:30:48.138 --> 00:30:49.638
How could you do this to me?!

00:30:49.806 --> 00:30:52.266
I did you a favor!
We can finally get out of here!

00:30:52.434 --> 00:30:55.144
This is the money of the people!
This is all they have!

00:30:59.733 --> 00:31:01.650
You disgrace those boots!

00:31:01.818 --> 00:31:03.694
Comandante, please, I can explain!

00:31:03.862 --> 00:31:05.071
Arrest them!

00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:11.369
Hurry up! Get to the bridge!

00:31:11.536 --> 00:31:15.706
- You tricked me!
- I had to! You left me no choice!

00:31:23.632 --> 00:31:24.757
Mama...

00:31:24.925 --> 00:31:26.759
Pequeño.

00:31:27.677 --> 00:31:28.677
Watch out!

00:31:45.028 --> 00:31:46.445
Oh, no.

00:31:46.613 --> 00:31:48.614
Puss. I can't get up.

00:31:48.782 --> 00:31:50.991
Puss! Help me. I can't get up!

00:31:51.159 --> 00:31:52.493
Freeze!

00:31:53.286 --> 00:31:55.079
Puss, save me!

00:31:55.789 --> 00:31:57.206
Save yourself.

00:31:58.417 --> 00:31:59.583
We got you.

00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:18.185
I lost everything
I cared about that day.

00:32:19.187 --> 00:32:21.021
My brother.

00:32:21.189 --> 00:32:22.690
My honor.

00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:24.191
My home.

00:32:25.861 --> 00:32:30.448
All I thought about was the
disappointment in my mama's eyes.

00:32:31.867 --> 00:32:34.368
And I have been running ever since.

00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:40.875
The egg betrayed me.

00:32:41.543 --> 00:32:44.712
His lies cost me everything.

00:32:47.466 --> 00:32:49.717
- Hey!
- I'm awake!

00:32:49.885 --> 00:32:52.011
You think I don't want to fix the past?

00:32:55.515 --> 00:32:57.099
I can't get down.

00:33:06.109 --> 00:33:10.029
Listen. A day... A day doesn't go by

00:33:10.197 --> 00:33:12.323
when I don't think about what I lost.

00:33:14.534 --> 00:33:17.036
I lost my best friend.

00:33:17.204 --> 00:33:19.455
My only friend.

00:33:19.623 --> 00:33:22.583
And I get it now. I got greedy
and desperate and I let you down.

00:33:22.751 --> 00:33:24.793
I let myself down.

00:33:24.961 --> 00:33:27.463
All I'm asking for, Puss,
is a second chance.

00:33:27.631 --> 00:33:31.842
Give me that second chance
and I'll help you pay back San Ricardo.

00:33:32.886 --> 00:33:34.762
Please, Puss.

00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.723
Let me show you
what our friendship meant to me.

00:33:42.562 --> 00:33:45.272
- I will do it.
- That's great.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:50.653
I will do this for my mother
and for San Ricardo... not for you.

00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.323
We are not partners
and we are not friends.

00:33:55.158 --> 00:33:59.995
OK. I promise this time,
I will not let you down.

00:34:01.164 --> 00:34:02.331
Yes!

00:34:03.583 --> 00:34:05.834
I think we got our Bean Club back.

00:34:26.147 --> 00:34:27.565
Humpty's plan better work.

00:34:27.732 --> 00:34:32.736
Listen, you just need to worry about
your part. Don't screw it up.

00:34:32.904 --> 00:34:35.239
- What?
- Again with the mask?

00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:38.993
I don't need style advice
from Mr. Dusty Boots.

00:34:46.543 --> 00:34:48.335
Come on, Puss. Now!

00:34:52.632 --> 00:34:55.217
Our biological clocks
are tickin', darlin'.

00:34:55.385 --> 00:34:58.053
- You gotta look at the big picture.
- What's your problem?

00:34:59.222 --> 00:35:01.473
Listen.
I put a lot of work into my body.

00:35:01.641 --> 00:35:04.602
I look good, and I am not
just gonna throw that away.

00:35:07.689 --> 00:35:09.648
- Hey, hey, hey.
- What?

00:35:09.816 --> 00:35:11.275
- We're gonna start small.
- Look.

00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:13.402
Let's just pretend you have a baby.

00:35:15.071 --> 00:35:16.405
Excellent.

00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:23.162
I don't have time to be at home
with no diapers and baby socks.

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:25.998
You don't have to, Jill.
I'll be the stay-at-home dad.

00:35:26.166 --> 00:35:28.584
We got ten hungry piggies,
there in the back.

00:35:28.752 --> 00:35:31.503
You can practice on them.
Just pull over, feed them.

00:35:31.671 --> 00:35:33.589
- That little Hamhock's my favorite.
- You've got to hurry up.

00:35:33.757 --> 00:35:35.341
He's a cute little bugger.

00:35:35.508 --> 00:35:37.551
Why are you not using your claws?

00:35:37.719 --> 00:35:39.637
Would you please just shut up!
I'm on it!

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.306
- Just use your claws!
- Be quiet.

00:35:42.474 --> 00:35:45.476
- Your claws!
- I don't have any claws, all right?!

00:35:46.227 --> 00:35:47.811
Was that Hamhock?

00:35:53.276 --> 00:35:56.320
There, there.
Sleepy, sleepy, big, fat piggy.

00:35:58.573 --> 00:36:01.075
Remember when we had to pretend
we had that monkey one time...?

00:36:01.242 --> 00:36:02.660
You babysit.

00:36:03.495 --> 00:36:05.913
- Soft paws.
- When did we have a monkey?

00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:09.625
Well?

00:36:09.793 --> 00:36:11.669
...what happened last time...
You sat on it, Jack.

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:13.921
Hello, beans of legend.

00:36:14.923 --> 00:36:15.923
Let's go.

00:36:24.974 --> 00:36:28.519
Well, well, well.
Look what we have here, Jill.

00:36:28.687 --> 00:36:31.313
You messed with our baby.

00:36:32.816 --> 00:36:35.651
And you took my beans.

00:36:37.237 --> 00:36:38.487
Sausage bomb!

00:36:44.577 --> 00:36:48.163
You're gonna pay for this!
Soul-sucking cats!

00:36:49.374 --> 00:36:50.541
Signal the egg!

00:36:52.252 --> 00:36:53.585
Yes!

00:36:57.966 --> 00:36:59.591
- OK.
- Ready.

00:36:59.759 --> 00:37:01.760
- Set.
- Go!

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.361
Oh, my God!

00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:40.299
All right, cat. Give me them beans.

00:37:41.676 --> 00:37:44.428
Is it true
a cat always lands on its feet?

00:37:44.596 --> 00:37:47.389
No! That is just a rumor spread by dogs!

00:37:48.057 --> 00:37:49.767
Well, let's find out.

00:37:57.233 --> 00:37:59.568
See? I told you I wouldn't let you down!

00:37:59.736 --> 00:38:01.487
You think this is over?

00:38:08.244 --> 00:38:09.495
Hey, that was close!

00:38:19.798 --> 00:38:20.881
Now!

00:38:23.885 --> 00:38:27.346
We just got to make it to that bridge!
Hang on!

00:38:28.765 --> 00:38:31.266
- Humpty! There is no bridge!
- Trust me.

00:38:37.816 --> 00:38:39.274
Humpty!

00:38:44.030 --> 00:38:46.615
We're going to die!

00:38:58.837 --> 00:39:00.462
I hate cats.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.256
This is war!

00:39:10.974 --> 00:39:12.641
Giant's castle...

00:39:13.309 --> 00:39:14.810
...here we come.

00:39:17.939 --> 00:39:19.815
I must hand it to the egg.

00:39:19.983 --> 00:39:22.776
This was a team effort.
Humpty still has his claws...

00:39:22.944 --> 00:39:27.948
I mean, flaws. That was what I meant,
not claws. He's not a cat.

00:39:28.449 --> 00:39:31.326
- Not to say there's anything wrong...
- I don't want to talk about it.

00:39:31.494 --> 00:39:32.995
Got it.

00:39:34.122 --> 00:39:35.873
OK, we should be close!

00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:39.251
Keep your eyes out
for any strange cloud activity!

00:39:40.461 --> 00:39:43.171
I am called Kitty Softpaws
because I'll steal you blind

00:39:43.339 --> 00:39:45.549
and you'll never know I was there.

00:39:51.806 --> 00:39:52.890
Kitty?

00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:56.184
You are not as good as they say.

00:39:58.062 --> 00:40:00.188
You're better.

00:40:03.318 --> 00:40:05.819
I will respect your privacy.

00:40:09.991 --> 00:40:12.492
OK. I'll tell you.

00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:15.412
I was just a stray...

00:40:15.914 --> 00:40:18.582
...but I had beautiful claws.

00:40:19.959 --> 00:40:23.629
One day,
a really nice couple took me in.

00:40:23.796 --> 00:40:26.131
Gave me milk every morning.

00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:27.633
Loved me.

00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:34.473
Maybe I scratched their curtains
or played too rough with the hamster.

00:40:34.641 --> 00:40:36.975
I don't know why they did it.

00:40:37.685 --> 00:40:39.686
But they took my claws.

00:40:41.356 --> 00:40:43.523
Cat people are crazy.

00:40:45.568 --> 00:40:47.319
Stop the coach! I think this is it!

00:41:07.799 --> 00:41:09.633
Can you believe this, Puss?

00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:12.552
After all these years!

00:41:14.055 --> 00:41:17.224
Here. I want you to plant them.

00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:26.233
That... is a strange cloud.

00:41:28.569 --> 00:41:31.738
OK! This is it! It's happening, hurry!

00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:36.243
This way!

00:41:36.411 --> 00:41:38.036
Good, good.
Come on, come on, come on.

00:41:38.454 --> 00:41:40.664
Twenty-three divided by cloud depth.

00:41:40.832 --> 00:41:42.541
Hole! Right here.

00:41:45.545 --> 00:41:47.421
Now place the beans.

00:41:49.173 --> 00:41:51.216
Place the beans carefully, please.

00:41:51.384 --> 00:41:54.177
Not on top of each other.
The magic is very delicate.

00:41:54.679 --> 00:41:58.515
OK, good. Very good.
Now just stand back.

00:42:41.976 --> 00:42:43.226
What's happening here?

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:45.312
Maybe the magic rubbed off
in your pocket?

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.648
- That's impossible.
- OK, OK. Let's not panic.

00:42:48.816 --> 00:42:50.901
You know, I read somewhere
that plants have feelings.

00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:54.738
So, come on...
say something nice to it.

00:42:54.906 --> 00:42:55.906
OK.

00:42:56.908 --> 00:42:58.575
Let me just think for a second.

00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:00.494
Hi, little plant.

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:23.160
Guys?

00:44:23.870 --> 00:44:25.704
Humpty!

00:44:25.872 --> 00:44:28.874
- I do not see him. Do you see him?
- I don't see him anywhere.

00:44:29.041 --> 00:44:31.334
You sound weird.

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:34.337
It's the thin air!

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:39.176
Come on in! It feels great!

00:44:45.641 --> 00:44:48.476
The cloud, it tickles my nose.

00:44:48.686 --> 00:44:52.063
That's because they effervesce!
Who knew?

00:44:58.196 --> 00:44:59.362
Come on.

00:45:17.173 --> 00:45:18.340
Gotcha!

00:45:22.511 --> 00:45:23.678
Meow.

00:45:24.764 --> 00:45:27.933
Hey, Puss.
What do you think? Do I shave?

00:45:28.935 --> 00:45:30.435
Let me show you something.

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:40.028
Somewhere down there,
there are two little kids,

00:45:40.196 --> 00:45:42.322
I don't know, maybe orphans,

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:45.408
and they're laying on a hill,
staring at the clouds,

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:47.494
dreaming about the future.

00:45:48.329 --> 00:45:50.163
That was me and you, Puss.

00:45:50.831 --> 00:45:52.832
Me and you.

00:45:54.752 --> 00:45:55.961
Boys!

00:45:56.128 --> 00:45:59.839
You might want to take a look at this.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.345
The giant's castle.

00:46:08.516 --> 00:46:10.558
OK, time to suit up.

00:46:10.726 --> 00:46:11.768
Humpty!

00:46:11.936 --> 00:46:14.437
I'll fit right in with the golden eggs.

00:46:18.192 --> 00:46:19.776
Brilliant or what, huh?

00:46:19.944 --> 00:46:23.530
Humpty, you're not wearing underwear!

00:46:23.698 --> 00:46:27.450
What? Are you embarrassed? I'm not.

00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:32.539
Puss, remember when everyone
was laughing at Bean Club?

00:46:32.707 --> 00:46:35.583
And who is laughing now? We are!

00:46:46.387 --> 00:46:48.221
Wow!

00:47:00.693 --> 00:47:03.653
That is our target.

00:47:03.821 --> 00:47:05.864
Hey, you don't sound
like an elf anymore.

00:47:06.032 --> 00:47:07.741
It's because the air pressure
in here is normal.

00:47:07.908 --> 00:47:08.950
Let's go.

00:47:12.997 --> 00:47:16.624
So here is the plan: You two get
the golden eggs, I will fight the giant.

00:47:16.792 --> 00:47:19.544
There's no giant to fight.
The giant's been dead for years.

00:47:19.712 --> 00:47:21.963
- What?!
- You didn't do the reading, did you?

00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:25.467
Jack and the Beanstalk, chapter 14,
"Giant Takes a Big Dirt Nap."

00:47:26.052 --> 00:47:27.218
Ankle burn.

00:47:30.514 --> 00:47:33.350
- What was that?
- They call it the Great Terror.

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:35.935
It's the monster that guards
the Golden Goose.

00:47:36.103 --> 00:47:38.688
Legend has it that if you look at it,
you'll turn to stone.

00:47:38.856 --> 00:47:42.317
But nobody really knows because
nobody's walked away from it alive.

00:47:42.485 --> 00:47:44.402
Follow me and keep quiet.

00:47:54.497 --> 00:47:55.747
Shh! Humpty!

00:47:55.915 --> 00:47:58.875
I can't help it.
Everything's rubbing and pinching!

00:47:59.043 --> 00:48:00.668
I need powder!

00:48:16.936 --> 00:48:19.104
How are we gonna get across?

00:48:19.271 --> 00:48:20.355
Champagne.

00:48:24.026 --> 00:48:25.318
Cheers!

00:48:37.164 --> 00:48:39.582
Do not worry. I will protect you.

00:48:41.752 --> 00:48:45.088
What are you gonna do?
Hit it in the head with a guitar?

00:48:45.256 --> 00:48:48.425
Please. Stop bringing up the guitar.

00:49:06.819 --> 00:49:08.236
Catch me!

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:11.614
Hurry!

00:49:12.992 --> 00:49:14.117
Hide!

00:49:15.536 --> 00:49:16.995
Don't look at it!

00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:25.462
- Humpty! Be quiet!
- I'm hyperventilating!

00:49:26.547 --> 00:49:29.382
I said I couldn't breathe and then
you zipped the thing over my mouth!

00:49:30.217 --> 00:49:32.552
You gotta get it together. Come on!

00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:33.887
OK.

00:49:48.944 --> 00:49:52.822
Look at this. It's egg paradise.

00:49:54.116 --> 00:49:57.118
It's so beautiful,
I feel like I belong here.

00:50:02.958 --> 00:50:04.375
Golden eggs.

00:50:06.462 --> 00:50:08.213
Grab as many as you can.

00:50:09.632 --> 00:50:12.884
I thought they were going to be
like chicken size.

00:50:13.052 --> 00:50:17.305
Can you imagine laying
one of these? Ouch!

00:50:17.473 --> 00:50:18.890
Puss!

00:50:21.810 --> 00:50:23.436
How are we supposed to
get these out of here?

00:50:23.604 --> 00:50:24.896
I don't know.

00:50:26.774 --> 00:50:29.234
Oh, my!

00:50:33.155 --> 00:50:35.240
The Golden Goose.

00:50:36.408 --> 00:50:39.577
Just look at her. Isn't she beautiful?

00:50:51.173 --> 00:50:52.674
My sweet darling.

00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:56.344
I think she likes you.

00:50:59.348 --> 00:51:00.723
Let's just take her.

00:51:00.891 --> 00:51:02.600
Wait a minute.
This is the goose of legend.

00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:04.519
We don't know what happens
if we take her.

00:51:05.563 --> 00:51:08.982
I know what happens
if we don't take her, we got nothing.

00:51:09.149 --> 00:51:13.403
Guys, guys. It's a gold pooper.
We're taking it!

00:51:22.997 --> 00:51:24.122
Almost there!

00:51:27.042 --> 00:51:35.216
Hang on!

00:51:56.238 --> 00:51:57.697
It's coming!

00:51:57.865 --> 00:51:59.324
Run!

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:16.341
Kitty!

00:52:18.594 --> 00:52:20.219
What are you doing?

00:52:42.868 --> 00:52:44.285
Hang on!

00:52:48.707 --> 00:52:50.041
Come here, you.

00:52:53.879 --> 00:52:54.962
Got you!

00:52:56.423 --> 00:52:57.882
She's mine now!

00:53:07.726 --> 00:53:09.060
Hello!

00:53:14.942 --> 00:53:17.819
Oh, no! Fly, little gosling, fly!

00:53:22.282 --> 00:53:25.159
No! It's not supposed to be this way!

00:53:27.162 --> 00:53:28.830
- Puss?
- No.

00:53:37.631 --> 00:53:39.132
I'm sorry.

00:53:54.481 --> 00:53:56.482
Thanks, Ginger.

00:54:03.198 --> 00:54:05.116
We should maybe cut that down.

00:54:09.371 --> 00:54:13.332
Look at that. You finally
got that family you wanted, Jack.

00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:16.377
Did you hear that?
I think he just called me Daddy.

00:54:17.463 --> 00:54:20.882
- He looks just like you, Jack.
- Thank you.

00:54:31.310 --> 00:54:33.144
Well, what is it?

00:54:43.906 --> 00:54:46.741
I do believe that's our cue.

00:54:51.455 --> 00:54:53.706
To paying back San Ricardo!

00:54:53.874 --> 00:54:55.458
To being rich!

00:54:55.626 --> 00:54:56.751
¡Olé!

00:55:11.391 --> 00:55:12.517
You.

00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:13.976
Me?

00:55:14.144 --> 00:55:15.686
Yeah, yeah, baby!

00:55:18.315 --> 00:55:20.149
One, two, cha-cha-cha!

00:55:20.317 --> 00:55:22.318
Three, four, cha-cha-cha!

00:55:22.486 --> 00:55:24.278
One, two... What?!

00:55:25.823 --> 00:55:29.826
There is one word for you,
Kitty Softpaws: Me-wow!

00:55:29.993 --> 00:55:34.914
I know you have quite a reputation
with the ladies, Mr. Friskie Two-Times.

00:55:35.082 --> 00:55:38.251
I've also been known as the...
Furry Lover!

00:55:40.254 --> 00:55:42.421
But that was before I met you.

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:47.593
You don't know me, Puss. I'm not who
you think I am. I'm all about the score.

00:55:47.845 --> 00:55:52.849
Come on. Look me in the eyes and
tell me all you care about is the gold.

00:55:53.851 --> 00:55:55.101
Puss...

00:55:55.269 --> 00:55:56.352
Kitty...

00:55:57.479 --> 00:55:58.521
Oh, my God!

00:56:00.899 --> 00:56:01.899
New partners!

00:56:02.651 --> 00:56:06.571
Do not fall for his animal magnetism.
You stay focused.

00:56:08.115 --> 00:56:09.240
What?!

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.626
So... I have been thinking,
Miss Softpaws,

00:56:20.794 --> 00:56:24.422
that when we go our separate ways,
we can go our separate ways...

00:56:24.756 --> 00:56:26.257
...together.

00:56:28.302 --> 00:56:30.511
Puss, you have to go, now.

00:56:30.679 --> 00:56:34.348
You do not have to push me away
anymore. You can trust me.

00:56:34.516 --> 00:56:39.812
Give it up for the legends of San
Ricardo, Humpty and Puss! We did it!

00:56:41.648 --> 00:56:45.318
- I'm calling it a night, guys.
- Kitty! Stay up with us.

00:56:45.485 --> 00:56:49.322
No, I feel a... hairball coming on.

00:56:49.948 --> 00:56:52.325
OK, yeah. Have fun with that!

00:56:52.993 --> 00:56:55.036
We should give her some privacy.

00:56:57.581 --> 00:57:00.082
I never thought we would get to here.

00:57:01.168 --> 00:57:03.169
After all we went through...

00:57:03.921 --> 00:57:06.005
...to pull this off, together.

00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:10.676
It is good to have my brother back.

00:57:11.261 --> 00:57:14.221
Yep. Sure is.

00:57:15.057 --> 00:57:17.058
Well, we have a big day tomorrow.

00:57:18.226 --> 00:57:20.061
Pretty exciting stuff.

00:57:20.228 --> 00:57:21.896
We should get some rest.

00:57:23.231 --> 00:57:25.399
Good night, Humpty.

00:57:31.990 --> 00:57:33.074
Canasta!

00:58:05.190 --> 00:58:07.149
I am still alive!

00:58:12.447 --> 00:58:14.448
Jack and Jill.

00:58:15.826 --> 00:58:17.118
Kitty?

00:58:17.285 --> 00:58:18.452
Humpty?

00:58:20.956 --> 00:58:22.957
I will find you.

00:58:27.379 --> 00:58:28.963
Get out of here!

00:59:23.101 --> 00:59:24.435
Be gone!

00:59:26.021 --> 00:59:29.482
What do you want? Gold? I have gold!

00:59:29.649 --> 00:59:32.485
Jack, egg's trying to bribe us.

00:59:32.652 --> 00:59:33.986
With our own gold.

00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:36.405
Come on now,
all we want is a little breakfast.

00:59:36.573 --> 00:59:39.408
- No, no, please!
- How do you like your eggs, pumpkin?

00:59:39.576 --> 00:59:41.243
Humpty, no!

00:59:47.417 --> 00:59:49.085
Hello, Puss.

00:59:49.252 --> 00:59:51.087
Surprise!

00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:55.132
What is going on?

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:59.220
It's a surprise party,
and the surprise is on you.

00:59:59.387 --> 01:00:01.972
Looks like the cat's out of the bag.

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:03.682
You were in cahoots?!

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:06.143
Oh, yeah! They all work for me.

01:00:09.356 --> 01:00:13.526
I spent a lot of time in prison
preparing for this.

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:16.403
- You set me up.
- Oh, yeah, I set you up. Of course.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:20.908
You think this was all about getting
the gold and clearing your name?

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:25.412
This little adventure
was about one thing.

01:00:26.414 --> 01:00:27.915
Revenge.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:33.838
You never knew it, Puss...
but I was always there.

01:00:55.277 --> 01:00:59.029
You wanted to repay an old debt, Puss?
Well, so did I.

01:00:59.197 --> 01:01:00.573
Why would you do this?

01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:02.158
You left me on that bridge!

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.451
You abandoned me
when I needed you the most.

01:01:04.619 --> 01:01:07.163
- What happened to "brothers forever"?!
- I trusted you!

01:01:07.330 --> 01:01:09.373
Well, now you're finally gonna know
what it feels like,

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:12.334
you know, to trust someone
and have them stab you in the back.

01:01:12.502 --> 01:01:14.295
Guards!

01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:19.258
Puss In Boots, you're under arrest
for the robbery of the San Ricardo Bank!

01:01:19.426 --> 01:01:21.427
Consider this the final meeting
of Bean Club.

01:01:21.595 --> 01:01:23.470
I should scramble you with onions!

01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:27.224
You should never have come back.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:31.353
¡Pequeño! Wait.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.647
Do not fight them, please.

01:01:33.815 --> 01:01:36.609
Mama! Listen to me. I can explain.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:41.155
No. Puss, no more running.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:45.492
Please stop breaking my heart
and face what you have done.

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:50.164
I'm sorry, Mama.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:52.666
I let you down.

01:01:55.921 --> 01:01:57.922
Paws where we can see them!

01:01:59.090 --> 01:02:01.091
Turn around... slow.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:04.762
Slower!

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:14.521
Step into the carrier... quiet-like.

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:26.283
Attention! Attention, everyone! If you
could just come in a little closer.

01:02:26.451 --> 01:02:32.039
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you... the Golden Goose of legend!

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:39.588
Kitty. Not you, too?

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:46.929
Gold for everyone!

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.101
We got some fresh,
hot gold here, people!

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:55.604
Step right up! Get it hot!

01:02:56.815 --> 01:02:58.941
¡Huevos! ¡Huevos! ¡Huevos!

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.367
One hat.

01:03:08.535 --> 01:03:10.703
One belt.

01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:13.038
And two boots...

01:03:13.206 --> 01:03:16.041
...once a symbol of honor.

01:03:17.711 --> 01:03:20.337
One bottle of catnip?

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.132
It is for my glaucoma.

01:03:26.678 --> 01:03:30.222
This is where you belong, outlaw.

01:03:30.390 --> 01:03:34.727
And this is where you will stay...
forever.

01:03:52.579 --> 01:03:55.247
No, no. Don't stop on my account.

01:04:07.344 --> 01:04:11.722
Well, it looks like the egg
got what he wanted.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:13.724
You're talking about Humpty?

01:04:13.892 --> 01:04:19.188
Don't say his name! I used to
share this cell with that smelly thing.

01:04:19.356 --> 01:04:22.316
Happiest day of my life
was when he left.

01:04:22.484 --> 01:04:25.194
Till I realized he stole my magic beans.

01:04:25.362 --> 01:04:28.489
Wait, wait, wait!
You had the beans? Who are you?

01:04:30.367 --> 01:04:32.076
Hey! What's your name?

01:04:32.243 --> 01:04:34.078
Andy Beanstalk!

01:04:34.245 --> 01:04:36.080
My friends call me Jack.

01:04:36.247 --> 01:04:39.583
I traded the family cow for them beans.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:41.668
Course'n, it wasn't my family's cow.

01:04:41.836 --> 01:04:44.755
It was some other family's family cow.
That's why I got eight to ten.

01:04:44.923 --> 01:04:48.926
Always know which cow is yours.

01:04:50.220 --> 01:04:52.054
Crazy man. Wake up!

01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:54.223
What else do you know?

01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:58.102
We're all goners,
thanks to that little stinky!

01:04:58.269 --> 01:05:03.524
I told him not to take the goose,
but all he wanted was his revenge!

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:06.026
Don't take the goose. Why?

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:13.409
The Great Terror!
That's the Golden Goose's mama.

01:05:13.576 --> 01:05:14.868
Oh, no.

01:05:15.036 --> 01:05:17.704
And she will be out for blood

01:05:17.872 --> 01:05:21.417
when she comes back for her baby.

01:05:22.335 --> 01:05:26.213
Guard! San Ricardo is in terrible
danger! You must listen to me!

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.714
Quiet, you!

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:53.073
Shut up.

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:12.759
Open the door.

01:06:20.018 --> 01:06:22.019
Drop the weapon.

01:06:23.188 --> 01:06:25.147
Very good.

01:06:25.315 --> 01:06:27.483
Step aside.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:29.651
No.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.612
Diablo Gato!

01:06:32.530 --> 01:06:33.780
Nice try.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:48.504
I hope you can forgive me.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:51.465
Apology accepted!

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.551
I don't really have time for you.

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.803
I have to save the town
from the Great Terror!

01:06:56.971 --> 01:06:58.805
Wait, Puss!

01:06:58.973 --> 01:07:00.891
Don't you see? I'm here because...

01:07:01.893 --> 01:07:04.645
I am here
because you made me realize

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:07.898
that there is something
I care about more than gold.

01:07:08.816 --> 01:07:10.609
Something?

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:13.654
OK. Someone.

01:07:13.821 --> 01:07:16.698
He's about two feet tall,
wears high heels.

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:18.325
Handsome?

01:07:18.493 --> 01:07:20.452
He's very handsome.

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:21.870
A real beefcake?

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:23.997
- A stallion?
- Yes.

01:07:24.165 --> 01:07:26.041
- Tiger?
- Oh, brother.

01:07:27.001 --> 01:07:29.628
But this does not make us even.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:30.796
Freeze!

01:07:30.964 --> 01:07:32.422
Yes, it does.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.258
No, no, no, it doesn't.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:39.596
I saved you!

01:07:40.682 --> 01:07:42.182
You owed me one.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:44.768
You didn't tell me about Humpty.

01:07:46.938 --> 01:07:48.522
So now you owe me two.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:55.779
- You're a lot of work.
- I know. But I am worth it!

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:02.828
You are not getting away, Puss In Boots!

01:08:03.496 --> 01:08:04.997
Wrong boots.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:07.082
Kitty!

01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:08.917
Now we're even!

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:19.928
This is your San Ricardo weather report.

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:22.681
Chances of a giant goose
destroying the town...

01:08:23.266 --> 01:08:24.933
...one hundred percent.

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.649
Never alone, always together...

01:08:32.817 --> 01:08:34.151
Humpty and Puss...

01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:36.069
Brothers forever.

01:08:38.573 --> 01:08:43.952
Come on, sweetie. Let's get
out of here before Mama shows up.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:46.913
I should make you
into an egg salad sandwich!

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:49.541
That is disgusting!

01:08:49.709 --> 01:08:51.209
Give me the goose, Humpty.

01:08:51.377 --> 01:08:53.295
No can do, I'm afraid.

01:08:53.463 --> 01:08:55.464
See, the mama's on her way,
and when she gets here,

01:08:55.632 --> 01:08:59.968
it's bye-bye San Ricardo
and everything you ever cared about!

01:09:00.136 --> 01:09:03.972
Revenge on me is one thing,
but why Imelda? Why the orphanage?

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.682
This is our home.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.225
You mean your home.

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.980
I never belonged here.

01:09:12.148 --> 01:09:13.482
We had a plan to get out of here,

01:09:13.650 --> 01:09:17.819
but then you became a hero
and you picked this place over me.

01:09:19.155 --> 01:09:20.989
You left me with nothing.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.664
Humpty... I'm sorry I hurt you.

01:09:30.667 --> 01:09:35.087
But do not take it out on these people.
You are better than this!

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:38.632
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, come on!

01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:40.509
I know the real Humpty.

01:09:40.677 --> 01:09:44.805
The way you saw the world!
The inventor! The dreamer!

01:09:44.972 --> 01:09:47.265
What happened to that guy?

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:55.107
I... I think it's too late.

01:09:55.274 --> 01:09:57.776
It is never too late
to do the right thing.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.028
Together we can save San Ricardo!

01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:09.413
I can forgive you, Humpty...
if you help me now.

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.707
Really?

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:14.251
After everything I put you through?

01:10:14.419 --> 01:10:17.212
Prove to me there is still
a good egg in you.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:20.966
I'll try.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:14.019
Goggles, check.

01:11:14.187 --> 01:11:16.730
Get the baby over the bridge.
I'll get the mother to follow.

01:11:16.898 --> 01:11:18.398
OK. Give me a...

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:19.900
Puss!

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:45.217
Mama Goose!

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:50.555
Wait!

01:11:51.724 --> 01:11:54.184
Just follow me
and I will lead you to your baby.

01:11:59.065 --> 01:12:01.858
No! Not that way!

01:12:03.694 --> 01:12:05.320
Pequeño, help!

01:12:05.488 --> 01:12:06.947
Hang on!

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:18.166
That's my boy!

01:12:23.005 --> 01:12:25.465
Come with me, Mama Goose.
I know where your baby is.

01:12:25.633 --> 01:12:27.926
Here. Look!

01:12:39.397 --> 01:12:41.231
Humpty, pick up the pace!

01:12:41.399 --> 01:12:43.859
I'm trying, Puss! I'm trying!

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:52.450
Sorry, egghead,
we want more than just eggs.

01:12:52.618 --> 01:12:54.411
So how about you give us that goose!

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:55.495
Humpty!

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:58.331
Get her off!

01:13:00.084 --> 01:13:03.670
- Nice moves.
- What would you do without me?

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:09.551
Freeze!

01:13:12.722 --> 01:13:14.431
Comandante!

01:13:14.599 --> 01:13:16.057
I can explain?

01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:21.771
Gato, you are going back to jail
if it's the last thing I do!

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:23.231
Humpty, hurry!

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:26.693
We're almost there. We're almost there!

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:53.553
- Puss, help!
- Humpty, hang on!

01:13:53.721 --> 01:13:55.847
Puss!

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.233
Here we are again, right, Puss?

01:14:09.820 --> 01:14:13.281
I will not leave you behind
this time, Humpty.

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:23.625
I'm sorry, Puss.

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.460
I've made a mess out of everything.

01:14:26.629 --> 01:14:29.005
I'm a rotten egg.

01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.758
I'm not a person.

01:14:31.926 --> 01:14:35.095
I'm not a bird. I'm not even a food.

01:14:36.722 --> 01:14:38.556
I don't know what I am.

01:14:38.724 --> 01:14:42.185
You are what you have always been.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:44.437
My brother.

01:14:46.732 --> 01:14:48.525
Brothers forever.

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:05.333
- You can't save us both.
- Yes, I can! Just hang on!

01:15:06.877 --> 01:15:11.965
Puss, you have to save the baby,
or the mama will destroy San Ricardo.

01:15:14.135 --> 01:15:15.719
It's the right thing to do.

01:15:18.597 --> 01:15:21.850
I will not let you go, Humpty.

01:15:22.935 --> 01:15:24.352
I know you won't.

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.355
So I won't make you choose.

01:15:28.733 --> 01:15:29.482
Humpty!

01:15:51.422 --> 01:15:53.298
I'm very sorry.

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:55.050
She's OK.

01:16:02.475 --> 01:16:04.768
Humpty?

01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:26.623
I always knew that you were good inside.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.138
Goodbye, Humpty.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:56.069
- Yeah, I think it's wonderful...
- And I got a goose egg.

01:16:56.737 --> 01:16:58.238
It's him. Puss In Boots.

01:16:58.405 --> 01:17:00.406
He saved us from the giant goose!

01:17:00.574 --> 01:17:02.367
His sword is like lightning!

01:17:02.535 --> 01:17:04.410
They say he has ten lives.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:08.373
His boots are made
of the finest Corinthian leather.

01:17:08.541 --> 01:17:10.834
He only drinks whole milk.

01:17:14.338 --> 01:17:15.630
Good leche.

01:17:15.798 --> 01:17:19.342
He's no outlaw. He saved us!

01:17:20.636 --> 01:17:21.678
Meow?

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:26.015
A gift for you, Mama.

01:17:28.727 --> 01:17:32.689
I have to go.
The soldiers are coming for me.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:37.026
I am so proud of you, my son.

01:17:39.947 --> 01:17:44.117
Today, you faced the past
with bravery and honor.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.370
You earned those boots.

01:17:47.538 --> 01:17:52.542
And the people know that
you are San Ricardo's greatest hero.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:55.545
I did it for you, Mama.

01:17:56.589 --> 01:17:59.340
You will always be in my heart.

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.718
And you in mine.

01:18:04.388 --> 01:18:06.347
¡Gato!

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:09.142
- There he is!
- I see him!

01:18:50.893 --> 01:18:54.604
I will see you again, Kitty Softpaws!

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:56.773
Sooner than you think.

01:19:04.823 --> 01:19:07.575
She is a bad kitty.

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:16.417
This is the story of a cat
who became a hero.

01:19:16.585 --> 01:19:21.089
An outlaw dedicated to justice.
And a lover of beautiful women.

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:24.884
A great... great lover.

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:27.679
Really. It is crazy.

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:30.890
I am Puss In Boots!

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:35.603
And my name would become... legend!

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:09.304
Meow.
