You know
the lake's gonna eat it.

00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:40.500
It took you half an hour
to find the right flat rock,

00:10:40.583 --> 00:10:42.000
but you gotta throw it.

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:44.375
Otherwise,
you're not gonna know if it's gonna skip.

00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:48.208

00:21:07.208 --> 00:21:09.708
Alright, I'm… I'm on it. Anything else?

00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:11.958
-No, you're so sweet.
-Okay.

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:18.250
[sighs]

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.458
[muttering quietly] Stupid.

00:21:23.666 --> 00:21:24.666
-[thud]
-Oh.

00:21:26.916 --> 00:21:27.916
Cool.

00:21:34.833 --> 00:21:36.916
Whoa. What is all this?

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:43.041
Alright, remember, Lydia,
you said you would not touch anything, so…

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.500
you should not.

00:21:50.833 --> 00:21:51.958
What do you do?

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:55.083
Oh! [laughs]

00:21:55.166 --> 00:21:57.541
Whoo! [hums]

00:21:58.166 --> 00:22:00.208
Ooh, it's like old-school Atari.

00:22:00.291 --> 00:22:03.583
-Let's see what she's got. Oh.
-[device powering up]

00:22:04.875 --> 00:22:07.458
It's a light switch. Pft. Big deal.

00:22:10.458 --> 00:22:13.166
Alright, I'm gonna sit,
not touch anything else,

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:15.541
and wait for my beer. [grunts]

00:22:15.625 --> 00:22:16.833
[device beeps]

00:22:17.583 --> 00:22:19.125
[Lydia straining]

00:22:20.041 --> 00:22:22.000
No! Ow! Ow!

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.250
Whoa! This is
the world's stupidest massage chair!

00:22:29.333 --> 00:22:31.208
It's not a massage chair, you idiot.

00:22:31.291 --> 00:22:34.000
There has been
a breach in the injection room.

00:22:34.083 --> 00:22:36.583
[moaning]

00:22:36.666 --> 00:22:40.208
-Get me out of here!
-Dear god, Lydia. What have you done?

00:22:40.291 --> 00:22:42.666
Emily, I didn't touch anything!

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.833
[spluttering] Okay, I touched a couple--
I touched one thing. I'm so sorry…

00:22:47.541 --> 00:22:49.291
[snoring]

00:22:51.541 --> 00:22:54.458
[Emily, echoing]
Twenty years of research down the drain.

00:22:54.541 --> 00:22:56.625
How could you leave her alone in the lab?

00:22:56.708 --> 00:23:00.833
[Jessie] She said you wanted me to get her
another beer. I'm sorry, Miss Stanton.

00:23:00.916 --> 00:23:03.708
Lydia, do you have any idea
what you've done?

00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:07.833
I've worked for this my entire life
and you've ruined everything.

00:23:07.916 --> 00:23:11.041
Oh, I don't know
what was in those needles,

00:23:11.125 --> 00:23:13.458
but I'm totally happy
to give it back to you.

00:23:13.541 --> 00:23:15.875
I can, like, pee in a cup or something--

00:23:15.958 --> 00:23:17.250
You don't understand.

00:23:18.041 --> 00:23:21.916
Tonight, I was going to begin treatments
I've been working on my whole life.

00:23:22.791 --> 00:23:25.500
I developed a genetic sequencing platform

00:23:25.583 --> 00:23:29.875
that can alter a human's biochemistry
in unimaginable ways.

00:23:30.541 --> 00:23:33.083
I finally finished
the work my parents started.

00:23:33.958 --> 00:23:36.958
I was going to find
a way to stop the Miscreants.

00:23:37.041 --> 00:23:41.083
I was going to become a super… person.

00:23:41.791 --> 00:23:42.708
Whoa.

00:23:43.666 --> 00:23:45.166
That is awesome, Em.

00:23:45.708 --> 00:23:47.500
I always knew you could do it.

00:23:47.583 --> 00:23:48.708
What's your power?

00:23:48.791 --> 00:23:51.416
They were supposed to be
super strength and invisibility,

00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:53.666
but you took
her treatment for strength.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:55.958
I'm really, really sorry.

00:23:56.041 --> 00:23:57.583
I didn't… I didn't mean to…

00:23:57.666 --> 00:24:00.875
Maybe you can just,
like, cook up another batch.

00:24:00.958 --> 00:24:03.500
It took five years to create that formula,

00:24:03.583 --> 00:24:04.666
and more importantly,

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:08.125
your body's undergoing
a molecular change from the injections.

00:24:08.208 --> 00:24:11.958
Your cardiovascular system
has been increased by 1,000%.

00:24:12.041 --> 00:24:16.250
It's how those intense boils on your face
have already healed themselves.

00:24:16.750 --> 00:24:19.000
Lydia, the process has started.

00:24:20.916 --> 00:24:24.583
Well, that's not… very soothing to hear.

00:24:24.666 --> 00:24:27.833
I mean, I feel weird and sweaty, and…

00:24:28.458 --> 00:24:32.666
my heart's poundin' like a jackhammer
inside my chest because of this serum.

00:24:32.750 --> 00:24:35.875
-What does that mean?
-If you stop taking the treatments,

00:24:35.958 --> 00:24:39.041
your veins will shred
like a log in a wood chipper.

00:24:39.625 --> 00:24:41.833
Jessie, could you report to security?

00:24:41.916 --> 00:24:43.083
Of course.

00:24:43.166 --> 00:24:46.208
Emily, the only logical thing
to do is stay the course.

00:24:46.291 --> 00:24:50.708
We'll continue with the super strength
treatments with the village idiot here

00:24:50.791 --> 00:24:53.291
and you begin the treatments
for invisibility.

00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:54.666
"Village idiot?"

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:59.583
Hello, Chicago is a city, not a village,
and the best city in the world.

00:24:59.666 --> 00:25:01.916
-The Bears, the Cubs--
-Not the time, Lydia.

00:25:02.833 --> 00:25:05.791
-There is no other way, is there?
-No, Emily. You know that.

00:25:06.375 --> 00:25:10.583
-Em, let's show you to your room.
-Wait a minute, I'm not staying here.

00:25:10.666 --> 00:25:14.541
I've got stuff to do. I got work
on Monday. I've got good Bulls tickets.

00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:16.208
If you stop the treatments,

00:25:16.291 --> 00:25:20.333
it's entirely possible that your body
will violently explode over the weekend.

00:25:22.333 --> 00:25:24.250
I can take a peek at a room, you know.

00:25:26.708 --> 00:25:27.708
[sighs]

00:25:32.916 --> 00:25:33.750
[Lydia] Whoa.

00:25:34.791 --> 00:25:37.500
This looks like the jail cell
on Battlestar Galactica.

00:25:37.583 --> 00:25:40.375
-Alright, come on, come on, come on.
-Alright.

00:25:40.458 --> 00:25:41.291
[door closes]

00:25:41.875 --> 00:25:45.916
The room is furnished in a non-distracting
manner to help with your recovery.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.541
Somebody tell me who Urkel is.

00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.083
-What's an Urkel?
-Not "what's," "who's" an Urkel.

00:25:51.166 --> 00:25:53.916
It's Urkel's… Urkel.
Tell her who Urkel is.

00:25:54.791 --> 00:25:56.166
How do you not-- Oh my god.

00:25:56.250 --> 00:26:00.916
You got glasses and suspenders,
you know, and you seem super smart.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.416
-Let me search.
-You know who Urkel is.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.000
-How do you spell that?
-You spell it Ur-kel.

00:26:06.083 --> 00:26:07.166
-Ur…
-Are you kidding?

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:08.791
[imitating Urkel] "Did I do that?"

00:26:09.541 --> 00:26:12.333
Right? Does that ring a-- "Did I do that?"

00:26:12.416 --> 00:26:15.291
"Did I do that?" You know that.

00:26:15.916 --> 00:26:18.041
"Did I… did I do that?"

00:26:18.125 --> 00:26:20.750
Mom, is she having
a reaction to the injection?

00:26:20.833 --> 00:26:22.708
No, she's always like this.

00:26:23.666 --> 00:26:24.625
Did you say "Mom"?

00:26:25.958 --> 00:26:27.583
"Mom"? You have a ki-- You…

00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:30.458
You have a kid and I didn't even know it?

00:26:30.541 --> 00:26:33.208
-You have a secret kid for 20 years?
-I'm only 15.

00:26:33.291 --> 00:26:36.333
Well, I don't know that
'cause she never told me!

00:26:36.416 --> 00:26:38.833
We don't have time for any of this.

00:26:38.916 --> 00:26:41.208
What is Jodie Foster's problem?

00:26:41.291 --> 00:26:43.291
Allie helped me set up this whole lab.

00:26:43.375 --> 00:26:45.625
She's former CIA. She runs things for me.

00:26:46.541 --> 00:26:48.333
Wh-- What? It's a compliment.

00:26:48.416 --> 00:26:51.666
I'm saying Jodie Foster, like,
"It puts the lotion in the basket,"

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:53.666
not "Tay in the wind" Jodie Foster.

00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:55.791
-Tay in the what?
-Tay in the wind. Ta--

00:26:55.875 --> 00:27:00.000
"Tay in the wind! Tay in the wind!" Nell?

00:27:00.083 --> 00:27:02.625
-Who's Nell?
-"Who's Nell?" Who's Nell?

00:27:03.583 --> 00:27:05.083
Jodie Foster, 1994.

00:27:05.166 --> 00:27:09.958
Jodie Foster knows it's Jodie Foster!
How do you not know "Tay in the wind"?

00:27:10.541 --> 00:27:16.958
We have clean women's clothing for you.
Everything you could possibly need,

00:27:17.041 --> 00:27:21.166
and we will burn what you are wearing
at the first opportunity.

00:27:21.250 --> 00:27:23.166
-Nobody's touchin' this.
-Yes, we are.

00:27:23.666 --> 00:27:27.291
This is an authentic 1994
Slayer concert T-shirt,

00:27:27.375 --> 00:27:29.500
bought in stadium,

00:27:29.583 --> 00:27:32.416
and if anybody touches any of this,

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.291
I'm sorry, I know you're young,
I'll murder all of you.

00:27:35.375 --> 00:27:39.250
Okay. Well, before we get there,
this device is for you.

00:27:39.833 --> 00:27:41.000
If you need anything,

00:27:41.083 --> 00:27:43.791
-someone will be on call.
-Why aren't you in school?

00:27:43.875 --> 00:27:45.958
First, it's the middle of the night,

00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:49.375
and second of all,
I graduated from Stanford last year.

00:27:49.458 --> 00:27:52.083
Wow, she's a chip off the old nerd block.

00:27:52.166 --> 00:27:54.416
She's not a nerd. She's smart.

00:27:54.958 --> 00:27:56.083
[both] There's a difference.

00:27:56.166 --> 00:27:58.833
And she helps us out a lot around here.

00:27:58.916 --> 00:28:00.416
She's great with tech.

00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.625
-Can I see your wrist for a second?
-Okay.

00:28:03.708 --> 00:28:06.833
This is so we can monitor
your vitals as you recover and train.

00:28:06.916 --> 00:28:08.750
-Heart rate, blood pressure…
-[beep]

00:28:08.833 --> 00:28:11.375
I've had something similar,
but on my ankle--

00:28:11.458 --> 00:28:14.125
Lydia, she's 15.
Let's monitor our stories.

00:28:14.208 --> 00:28:15.041
Got it.

00:28:15.125 --> 00:28:16.625
-You play Fortnite?
-Yes--

00:28:16.708 --> 00:28:18.208
-No.
-[Lydia] What's your handle?

00:28:18.791 --> 00:28:19.833
T-Wagon-14.

00:28:19.916 --> 00:28:23.208
Mine's L-Train-631-Harper-Avenue-
Apartment-7B.

00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:25.166
Wait, is that your address?

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.541
Oh my god, don't put your address online.

00:28:27.625 --> 00:28:30.083
I'm not putting my address online.

00:28:30.166 --> 00:28:34.541
I'm at 7A.
7B is my asshole neighbor, Steve.

00:28:34.625 --> 00:28:37.083
If somebody's gonna get whacked, it's him.

00:28:37.666 --> 00:28:41.333
We should play.
But I gotta warn you. I play dirty!

00:28:41.416 --> 00:28:42.416
[laughing]

00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:44.833
I am unbelievably bored.

00:28:44.916 --> 00:28:48.208
See you in the morning.
We start at 5:00 a.m.

00:28:48.291 --> 00:28:50.333
5:00 a.m.? Bullshit.

00:28:50.416 --> 00:28:52.791
Uh, I don't start at 5:00 a.m.

00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.500
[device beeps]
It's 5:00 a.m. Time to get up.

00:28:56.583 --> 00:28:58.583
[dramatic music plays]

00:29:00.375 --> 00:29:03.083
[Emily] Okay, let's get started.

00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:05.000
After a series of treatments,

00:29:05.083 --> 00:29:08.500
I'm estimating that we can increase
your ATP by 10,000%.

00:29:08.583 --> 00:29:12.083
Everything about you
will become stronger, including your skin,

00:29:12.166 --> 00:29:15.916
your vascular and skeletal systems,
making it more difficult to hurt you.

00:29:16.583 --> 00:29:21.416
And I'm estimating
that you'll be able to lift 20,000 pounds.

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:23.166
Roughly the weight of a city bus.

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:26.291
Oh my god, I'm gonna
throw the shit out of a city bus.

00:29:26.375 --> 00:29:27.375
Language.

00:29:27.458 --> 00:29:30.625
I'm gonna throw the pee crap
out of a city bus.

00:29:30.708 --> 00:29:33.541
That isn't better
and you're not gonna be throwing a bus.

00:29:33.625 --> 00:29:37.041
-That would be very bad.
-[Lydia silently mouthing]

00:29:37.125 --> 00:29:38.125
[Emily] Okay.

00:29:38.208 --> 00:29:41.333
First, I need you
to lift this mallet and hit the block.

00:29:41.916 --> 00:29:44.500
We'll monitor your vitals
and results to get our baseline.

00:29:44.583 --> 00:29:48.083
-Why does it look like a carnival thing?
-Because I'm fun.

00:29:48.166 --> 00:29:49.000
Okay.

00:29:49.083 --> 00:29:49.916
Yeah.

00:29:53.916 --> 00:29:55.083
Here goes nothin'.

00:29:56.458 --> 00:29:58.500
[Lydia grunts]

00:29:58.583 --> 00:30:02.083
I think I sprained my groin.
Do chicks have groins?

00:30:02.166 --> 00:30:03.833
-Yes.
-[Lydia] That's what I did.

00:30:03.916 --> 00:30:05.291
[groaning]

00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:09.583
I might have just peed
just a little bit in my suit too.

00:30:09.666 --> 00:30:12.166
According to this,
your bladder did release urine.

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.875
[exhales] Great first day, everybody.
I'll catch you tomorrow.

00:30:15.958 --> 00:30:18.625
I-- No, no, no.
We are just getting started.

00:30:18.708 --> 00:30:21.833
Now that we have a baseline,
it's time to start your treatment.

00:30:21.916 --> 00:30:23.916
It's not gonna like yesterday, is it?

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:25.708
[Emily] Not at all.

00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:28.083
Each treatment is completely unique.

00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:29.291
And it's safe, right?

00:30:29.375 --> 00:30:31.458
Oh my god, are they safe?

00:30:31.541 --> 00:30:33.333
It's a miracle you're still alive.

00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:36.916
There can be
possible complications with any treatment.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.750
Giving you super strength
has inevitable risks.

00:30:39.833 --> 00:30:41.958
-Like what?
-Oh…

00:30:42.041 --> 00:30:47.708
Like death, amnesia,
paralysis, stroke, brain death,

00:30:47.791 --> 00:30:50.750
living inside your mind,
unable to speak or convey thoughts,

00:30:50.833 --> 00:30:54.458
which would be the most unspeakable pain,
which we simply abbreviate as--

00:30:54.541 --> 00:30:56.166
[all] "The unspeakable."

00:30:56.250 --> 00:30:57.875
-And did I say death?
-Yes.

00:30:58.458 --> 00:31:01.791
You know, I'm scrambling
to find the silver lining here.

00:31:01.875 --> 00:31:04.625
What is it?
At least I don't have diarrhea.

00:31:04.708 --> 00:31:06.458
Severe diarrhea is a given.

00:31:06.541 --> 00:31:09.875
-That one right there is 100% a certainty.
-Oh my god.

00:31:09.958 --> 00:31:13.500
Look, I'll do everything
in my power to keep you safe.

00:31:14.416 --> 00:31:17.833
I'm doing this for my parents,
for this city.

00:31:18.833 --> 00:31:20.833
[emotional music swells]

00:31:23.458 --> 00:31:26.458
Let's get swole
and kick some Miscreant butt.

00:31:26.541 --> 00:31:28.125
[groaning in pain]

00:31:29.583 --> 00:31:30.416
Son of a…

00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:36.833
You said it wasn't gonna be
anything like it was yesterday.

00:31:36.916 --> 00:31:39.166
I meant metabolically speaking.

00:31:39.250 --> 00:31:42.833
Actually, the delivery method
is exactly the same.

00:31:42.916 --> 00:31:44.791
[wailing]

00:31:44.875 --> 00:31:47.333
I'm burning! My face is on fire!

00:31:47.416 --> 00:31:49.416
That should be over in two seconds.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.958
[continues wailing]

00:31:52.041 --> 00:31:53.083
Oh, yeah.

00:31:53.791 --> 00:31:56.833
Oh, that was--
I mean, you said it, but it's actually…

00:31:56.916 --> 00:31:58.583
It's even cool to the touch.

00:31:58.666 --> 00:32:02.458
How about you go pick up that mallet
and hit that thing again?

00:32:02.541 --> 00:32:07.958
I don't wanna, because I just got
a bazillion needles injected in my face.

00:32:08.041 --> 00:32:11.333
Give it a try, Lydia.
Your results should be instantaneous.

00:32:12.791 --> 00:32:16.875
Fine, alright. Hold on to your ta-tas,
'cause this thing's getting crushed.

00:32:17.458 --> 00:32:18.291
What are ta-tas?

00:32:18.375 --> 00:32:19.625
-Never mind.
-Okay.

00:32:21.125 --> 00:32:22.791
-[grunts]
-[thud]

00:32:24.208 --> 00:32:26.291
Well, that's a stone-cold bummer.

00:32:26.375 --> 00:32:29.000
That's really good
for only your second treatment.

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:32.666
What do you mean?
How many treatments are there?

00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:34.500
-Thirty-three.
-Oh my god.

00:32:34.583 --> 00:32:36.583
[dramatic music plays]

00:32:40.416 --> 00:32:42.708
[device] It's 5:00 a.m. Time to get up.

00:32:47.291 --> 00:32:49.500
Ah! Ah!

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.416
-[device beeps]
-[screaming in pain]

00:32:55.833 --> 00:32:56.958
Get outta here.

00:32:58.125 --> 00:32:59.333
Why my boobs?

00:32:59.416 --> 00:33:00.916
For this course of treatment,

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.041
it's important to inject
through the breast tissue

00:33:04.125 --> 00:33:05.666
into the pectoral muscle.

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:10.375
-When are we gonna start your treatments?
-Right now, actually.

00:33:11.125 --> 00:33:12.458
Here you go, Miss Stanton.

00:33:13.875 --> 00:33:16.125
-Thank you, Jessie.
-Wait, it's a pill?

00:33:16.708 --> 00:33:19.833
Your whole treatment is…
one stinking pill?

00:33:19.916 --> 00:33:22.833
It's a very large pill,
and I had to go off dairy for this.

00:33:26.708 --> 00:33:29.083
[device] It's 5:00 a.m. Time to get up.

00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:32.708
Ahh!

00:33:32.791 --> 00:33:35.666
Alright, hold on to your ta-tas, Bill.

00:33:40.041 --> 00:33:41.416
Totally meant to do that.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:42.583
Yeah, I'm good.

00:33:42.666 --> 00:33:46.125
It appears that Laser's reign
of destruction will never end,

00:33:46.208 --> 00:33:47.666
keeping our city on edge.

00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:51.833
The Chicago White Sox and Cubs
have suspended weekend baseball games

00:33:51.916 --> 00:33:55.208
due to the increase
in her recent lethal activities.

00:33:55.291 --> 00:33:59.083
Meanwhile, mayoral candidate
William "The King" Stevens'

00:33:59.166 --> 00:34:01.083
polling numbers have increased…

00:34:01.166 --> 00:34:03.541
-There you are, Miss Stanton.
-Thank you.

00:34:04.166 --> 00:34:06.000
[Lydia turns off TV] Ugh.

00:34:07.125 --> 00:34:08.500
I hear you're not eating.

00:34:09.083 --> 00:34:11.458
Nothing tastes right.
I'm not… I'm not hungry.

00:34:11.541 --> 00:34:13.666
That's expected.
But you still need to eat.

00:34:13.750 --> 00:34:15.958
Due to your body's changing chemistry,

00:34:16.041 --> 00:34:18.750
this may be
the only thing you can stomach.

00:34:18.833 --> 00:34:20.166
Ew!

00:34:20.250 --> 00:34:22.750
Why raw chicken? That's so gross.

00:34:22.833 --> 00:34:25.541
Your body needs pure uncooked amino acids

00:34:25.625 --> 00:34:28.875
and your skeleton
needs phosphorus for density.

00:34:37.416 --> 00:34:39.625
You can really taste the phosphorus.

00:34:39.708 --> 00:34:41.666
It's really good.

00:34:42.583 --> 00:34:43.958
God, I'm a monster.

00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:45.708
No, you're not.

00:34:45.791 --> 00:34:47.125
That's juicy.

00:34:47.208 --> 00:34:49.875
I have some work to do.

00:34:49.958 --> 00:34:51.416
I'm gonna be sick.

00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.708
-Don't judge me, it's so good.
-Oh my god.

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:55.875
My body needs it.

00:34:55.958 --> 00:34:58.250
I'm not an animal!

00:34:59.250 --> 00:35:03.208
[Emily] Alright.
This shot put is around 170 pounds.

00:35:03.291 --> 00:35:05.125
The average weight of an adult male.

00:35:05.208 --> 00:35:08.458
Oh, not the kind of beef I date.
I like 'em thick.

00:35:08.958 --> 00:35:11.625
-Here you go.
-I'm just kidding.

00:35:11.708 --> 00:35:12.958
Here we go.

00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:14.541
[Lydia chuckles]

00:35:15.625 --> 00:35:16.666
[crash]

00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:17.833
-Oh.
-Ugh.

00:35:18.833 --> 00:35:21.625
Do you own that part of the building too?

00:35:21.708 --> 00:35:23.875
The sign with my name on it? Yeah.

00:35:25.541 --> 00:35:28.916
Could have been Bill Stanton's building.
It's a common name.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.125
Hey, wait up.

00:35:30.208 --> 00:35:33.625
Ooh, I am unloading all over this guy.

00:35:33.708 --> 00:35:35.875
God, he's unloading on me. Wait.

00:35:35.958 --> 00:35:37.500
He's building all around me.

00:35:37.583 --> 00:35:40.583
-You are not good at this game.
-Can I ask you something?

00:35:40.666 --> 00:35:44.458
If you're never in school,
then how do you meet dudes, or chicks,

00:35:44.541 --> 00:35:48.333
or, you know,
non-specific gender.

00:35:48.416 --> 00:35:51.208
-Everybody's great. Whatever you're into.
-I like boys.

00:35:51.291 --> 00:35:54.416
Me, too. You dating anybody interesting?

00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.458
By interesting, I mean, hot.

00:35:57.541 --> 00:36:00.958
Okay. No, but thanks
for asking me about it.

00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:02.208
My mom doesn't…

00:36:02.791 --> 00:36:06.000
I don't know. We just
don't talk about that kind of stuff.

00:36:06.083 --> 00:36:09.583
Go easy on your mom. She's great.
She's got a lot of responsibility.

00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:12.416
-[grunts]
-Why are you still awake?

00:36:13.416 --> 00:36:15.875
[Emily]
It's one o'clock in the morning, Lydia.

00:36:15.958 --> 00:36:20.083
Tracy, you can't be goofing off like this.
We have a job to do.

00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:21.250
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:22.833
Go easy on her. It's my fault.

00:36:22.916 --> 00:36:23.833
Good night, Lydia.

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:26.166
Good night.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:31.208
She's always got her panties in a wad.
"It's one o'clock in the morning, Lydia."

00:36:31.291 --> 00:36:32.958
-You didn't sign off.
-[splutters]

00:36:34.291 --> 00:36:36.166
-You didn't sign off.
-[tablet chimes]

00:36:39.333 --> 00:36:41.000
Looks like it's just us…

00:36:42.375 --> 00:36:45.291
my little raw friend.

00:36:45.375 --> 00:36:46.250
[slurps]

00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:49.750
-Oh my god, we can still see you.
-Ew!

00:36:49.833 --> 00:36:51.291
No, you can't.

00:36:51.375 --> 00:36:53.416
For the love of god, hit the off button.

00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:56.375
I'm sorry. This bird is just so good.

00:36:56.458 --> 00:36:57.708
It's so good.

00:36:57.791 --> 00:37:00.166
Oh my god,
I've created a raw chicken monster.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:03.000
[kisses] Mwah! It's delicious.

00:37:03.666 --> 00:37:06.208
My compliments to whoever didn't cook it.

00:37:06.791 --> 00:37:07.791
Can't unsee that.

00:37:10.458 --> 00:37:11.458
[bell rings]

00:37:15.916 --> 00:37:18.291
Oh man. Tony, I'm sorry. That's on me.

00:37:18.375 --> 00:37:20.250
Alright, let's take a water break.

00:37:20.833 --> 00:37:22.291
-You want--
-Hey!

00:37:22.375 --> 00:37:23.333
Got it, got it.

00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:26.750
You get some water, Tony.

00:37:27.833 --> 00:37:28.833
[exhales]

00:37:30.208 --> 00:37:32.375
-We've been going at it.
-Yeah.

00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:34.708
Miss Stanton,
it's time for another treatment.

00:37:35.625 --> 00:37:37.750
-Thank you.
-If you can call it that.

00:37:40.375 --> 00:37:44.250
Please tell me that at least gives you
indigestion or heartburn or something.

00:37:44.333 --> 00:37:45.583
[coughing]

00:37:46.416 --> 00:37:47.958
[coughing]

00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:50.458
-Are you faking?
-Yeah.

00:37:50.541 --> 00:37:52.791
[Lydia chuckling]

00:37:52.875 --> 00:37:54.416
You are the worst.

00:37:57.583 --> 00:38:01.125
I have been wondering, if it's
none of my beeswax you can just tell me,

00:38:01.208 --> 00:38:03.000
but… where's Tracy's dad?

00:38:05.125 --> 00:38:08.875
Well, I was dating
a fellow researcher at Yale.

00:38:09.583 --> 00:38:13.208
And I suppose the romance
involved in the deep dive

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:17.541
into Boveri-Sutton chromosome
theory was too much for us to take.

00:38:17.625 --> 00:38:18.958
Oh, sexy science talk.

00:38:19.041 --> 00:38:20.625
[both laughing]

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:23.125
Well…

00:38:23.833 --> 00:38:27.875
when he found out about the baby,
he didn't want any part of it.

00:38:30.791 --> 00:38:32.125
Well, his loss.

00:38:34.166 --> 00:38:35.666
Tracy is an awesome kid.

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:38.250
Thanks. She is.

00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:40.958
Cooldown's over, guys.
Let's get back to it.

00:38:42.291 --> 00:38:45.125
"Get back"? We've been doing it
for two and a half hours.

00:38:45.208 --> 00:38:46.291
Thought we were done.

00:38:48.041 --> 00:38:49.208
Let's make a run.

00:38:49.291 --> 00:38:50.583
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:38:51.083 --> 00:38:54.125
-[bass-heavy rock]
-Oh my god, Miscreants! Look out!

00:38:54.208 --> 00:38:56.500
-Go, go, go.
-[Emily] I told you I was fun.

00:38:57.958 --> 00:39:00.625
Alright. You do
whatever you gotta do, Tony.

00:39:00.708 --> 00:39:02.375
Seems like overkill to me.

00:39:03.791 --> 00:39:05.500
Could be. Let's do this.

00:39:06.458 --> 00:39:08.250
-[loud thud]
-[Tony yelps]

00:39:09.333 --> 00:39:13.416
Oh man. Tony. I'm sorry, man. I'm just…

00:39:14.166 --> 00:39:17.500
I'm still trying to get the hang
of this strength thing. You okay?

00:39:17.583 --> 00:39:18.666
I'm good.

00:39:18.750 --> 00:39:19.750
Man.

00:39:19.833 --> 00:39:23.875
Well, I guess the injections
are working 'cause I keep hurtin' Tony.

00:39:23.958 --> 00:39:24.958
Pill time, Mom.

00:39:25.041 --> 00:39:26.541
Oh, thank you, honey.

00:39:27.208 --> 00:39:29.250
I keep seeing you taking these pills,

00:39:29.333 --> 00:39:32.291
but are we ever going to see
some action, or should I say,

00:39:32.375 --> 00:39:34.625
"Are we ever
going to not see some action?"

00:39:34.708 --> 00:39:36.833
-You didn't tell her?
-Tell me what?

00:39:36.916 --> 00:39:38.875
That was my last pill.

00:39:39.375 --> 00:39:43.500
Are you kidding? I've had, like,
thirty-five billion injections in my face

00:39:43.583 --> 00:39:45.958
and you've just been taking
a handful of pills.

00:39:46.041 --> 00:39:48.458
Do you feel any different?
Are they working?

00:39:48.541 --> 00:39:49.750
Well, let's see.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.375
[whoosh]

00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:55.250
[Lydia] Whoa!

00:39:55.333 --> 00:39:58.166
Oh, Em, say something,
you're freaking me out.

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.916
You gotta say something, Emily. I can't…

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.833
Alright. Where are you?
We're gonna put a bell on you.

00:40:03.916 --> 00:40:05.166
Just make a noise.

as I expand operations here.

whatever it is that you do, too.

and smack ya together like castanets, huh?

Uh, Grandma,

00:59:14.333 --> 00:59:16.458
have you, um, given any more thought

00:59:16.541 --> 00:59:18.750
to letting me get you a place
in a safer neighborhood?

00:59:19.458 --> 00:59:20.833
Why would I?

00:59:20.916 --> 00:59:25.083
This has been my home for a long time,
and it'll do me until the end.

00:59:25.166 --> 00:59:26.875
Please don't talk like that.

00:59:26.958 --> 00:59:29.708
I dig it, Grandma.  Morality, right?

00:59:29.791 --> 00:59:31.291
It's mortality.

00:59:31.375 --> 00:59:32.208
It's what?

00:59:32.291 --> 00:59:34.000
-Mortality.
-That's what I said.

00:59:34.083 --> 00:59:35.041
You said morality.

00:59:35.125 --> 00:59:37.208
-I'm-- What are you saying?
-Mortality.

Why not? We should probably tell somebody.
She probably knows.

01:00:01.875 --> 01:00:02.916
-Lydia--
-We're--

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.375
Oh, this is amazing.

01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:07.333
Oh, please let it be true.

01:00:07.416 --> 01:00:10.416
-I have been praying for this day.
-Praying for what?

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.375
-Really?
-[Grandma] For this moment.

01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:15.541
For you two
to tell me that you're a couple.

01:00:15.625 --> 01:00:18.083
I always knew
you were right for each other.

01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:20.750
-[Lydia chuckling]
-[Grandma cooing]

01:00:20.833 --> 01:00:22.791
[Lydia] Yeah, um…

01:00:22.875 --> 01:00:24.083
Wow, that's…

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:28.625
I have been saving it
for this very moment.

01:00:29.791 --> 01:00:32.125
[Grandma laughing happily]

01:00:32.208 --> 01:00:35.791
-I've got Michelle Obama arms.
-You really do. Your arms look amazing.

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:36.750
Which one am I?

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:39.083
Okay, you know…

01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:42.625
Uh, wow, that's a…
that's a lot to unpack.

01:00:43.458 --> 01:00:45.458
[Lydia] You know,
I think we both prefer…

01:00:46.875 --> 01:00:48.500
you know, dudes.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:52.875
-You don't have to look so disappointed.
-I can't help it.

01:00:52.958 --> 01:00:54.500
You could at least try.

01:00:54.583 --> 01:00:57.666
What? Now? You gotta woo me.

01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:59.125
I thought that was it.

01:00:59.208 --> 01:01:01.458
But if the secret is you're Thunder Force,

01:01:01.541 --> 01:01:04.583
you must think I don't watch the news.
You're a meme now.

01:01:04.666 --> 01:01:05.500
Well…

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:09.416
uh, Grandma that's kind of why we're here.

01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:12.000
You could be in danger.

01:01:12.083 --> 01:01:13.791
At least move into our building.

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:17.958
-Even if it's just temporarily.
-I'm not going anywhere.

01:01:18.916 --> 01:01:21.916
Those people out there killed my daughter,

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.875
took your parents from you,
ruined this city.

01:01:27.125 --> 01:01:30.416
Now I want you two strong women

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:31.916
to go out there,

01:01:32.583 --> 01:01:35.708
kick butt like the superheroes you are,

01:01:35.791 --> 01:01:38.125
and you don't stop until the job is done.

01:01:38.708 --> 01:01:40.708
-Okay.
-And only on that day

01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:44.958
when the city is free from Miscreants,

01:01:46.125 --> 01:01:47.541
can you two have a wedding.

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:50.291
-[Grandma laughing happily]
-Boom!

01:01:50.375 --> 01:01:53.791
-Come on, eat. It's getting cold.
-[overlapping chatter, laughter]

01:01:53.875 --> 01:01:55.500
[crowd cheering, clapping]

01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:57.833
Hello, Chicago,
thank you for being here.

01:01:57.916 --> 01:02:00.000
I won't take up too much of your time.

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:01.750
I just want you to know…

01:02:01.833 --> 01:02:04.250
-No sign of Laser.
-[Tracy] Keep your eyes open.

01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:06.583
Whoo.

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:09.875
This suit is getting ripe.
I gotta wash it.

01:02:09.958 --> 01:02:12.166
-You can't wash it.
-Are you kidding?

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:14.000
How am I supposed to keep it fresh?

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.875
-I need to work on that.
-Yeah, you do.

01:02:17.958 --> 01:02:18.875
Quickly.

01:02:18.958 --> 01:02:22.625
…for the rights and safety
of every last one of you.

01:02:22.708 --> 01:02:25.500
[cheering]

01:02:25.583 --> 01:02:28.583
[all chanting] Rachel!

01:02:28.666 --> 01:02:32.833
Let's give it up for our new super-team
who's out protecting our city every night.

01:02:32.916 --> 01:02:33.958
Thunder Force!

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:35.458
[cheering, applause]

01:02:39.583 --> 01:02:41.333
How's it going, Chicago?

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:48.041
Exciting news, Thunder Force is available
for selfies for the low price of $100.

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:51.000
"What? That seems so cheap."
"It sure does."

01:02:52.125 --> 01:02:56.666
Um, we do not take selfies,
and if we did, they'd be free.

01:02:58.208 --> 01:02:59.666
And they are free.

01:02:59.750 --> 01:03:03.000
They're free with a $100 donation.

01:03:03.625 --> 01:03:07.333
-[crowd chanting] Thunder Force!
-[Lydia] Stop!

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.916
Stop, stop, you guys, stop!

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.166
We can't take it.
Now how do we roll, Chicago?

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.416
-[crowd] Like thunder!
-How do we roll?

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.041
Like thunder!

01:03:17.125 --> 01:03:20.916
-[Lydia] How do we roll? How do we roll?
-[crowd chanting] Like thunder!

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:24.791
[reporter] One thing
we've been covering, early exit polling.

01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:27.666
We are watching
the minute-by-minute examples

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:30.458
that are coming into us
here at the station.

01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:32.916
Leading up to the breaking news,
we will have…

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.208
Maybe we should just turn that off.

01:03:35.291 --> 01:03:36.291
[Kenny] I think so.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.833
Hey, chief, you got concealer on?
Is that what that is?

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:43.208
Well, yeah. I moisturized it
and tried to touch it up a bit.

01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:44.666
-Is it helping?
-Not really.

01:03:44.750 --> 01:03:47.416
Go make a snack.
He doesn't need to look at this.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.000
-I'm not hungry.
-Preferably something with aloe.

01:03:50.083 --> 01:03:52.250
-Okay.
-Find an aloe plant and chew on that.

01:03:52.333 --> 01:03:53.333
-[clears throat]
-Hi!

01:03:53.875 --> 01:03:54.708
[The Crab] Ah!

01:03:55.541 --> 01:03:56.500
Never not funny.

01:03:56.583 --> 01:03:57.916
[chuckles]

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.166
So, how am I doing?

01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:00.791
With the, uh…

01:04:00.875 --> 01:04:03.875
I don't know. I'm not watching.
You shouldn't watch either.

01:04:03.958 --> 01:04:06.541
Maybe just go
make a pot of that and enjoy.

01:04:06.625 --> 01:04:09.458
[reporter 2]
…protecting our city, Thunder Force!

01:04:09.541 --> 01:04:10.583
[cheering]

01:04:10.666 --> 01:04:13.375
Thunder Force's
recent endorsement of Rachel Gonzales

01:04:13.458 --> 01:04:15.333
gave her a bump at the polls.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:17.125
-Andrew.
-Yeah.

01:04:17.208 --> 01:04:19.583
-Does this side look the same as this?
-No.

01:04:19.666 --> 01:04:22.250
Can you tell which?
One side has a small scab.

01:04:22.333 --> 01:04:24.833
-No, a large scab.
-Shit.

01:04:24.916 --> 01:04:28.541
[reporter 2] We have breaking news.
We are ready to call the election.

01:04:29.250 --> 01:04:32.583
Rachel Gonzales will be
the next mayor of Chicago.

01:04:32.666 --> 01:04:35.541
-And this is a major--
-The King doesn't lose!

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:42.875
-[reporter 1] …The King's full reaction.
-God damn it, sir.

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.750
That was Kenny.
Good member of the team.

01:04:45.833 --> 01:04:47.083
He shouldn't have been there.

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.625
Your eyes are doing the weird thing.
Can we get you drops?

01:04:50.708 --> 01:04:52.833
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

01:04:54.208 --> 01:04:56.208
That Thunder Force, they're everywhere.

01:04:57.458 --> 01:04:59.833
Someone needs to kill 'em.
They have to be dead.

01:05:02.166 --> 01:05:04.041
Will you stop doing that, please?

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:06.416
I'm not some little kid
throwing a tantrum!

01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:11.041
I'm very frustrated.

01:05:12.041 --> 01:05:14.125
And even though I killed that guy before,

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:16.208
it was kind of an accident, so…

01:05:17.041 --> 01:05:18.083
kill that guy.

01:05:26.750 --> 01:05:27.958
How do you feel now?

01:05:28.875 --> 01:05:31.833
Yeah, better. But not great. But better.

01:05:31.916 --> 01:05:34.916
You know, boss, I, uh…
I validate your feelings.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Your feelings are your feelings,
but tactically speaking

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:41.333
I don't think it's smart
to be killing off our best crew members.

01:05:41.416 --> 01:05:43.541
-Was that Walter she just zapped?
-Yeah.

01:05:43.625 --> 01:05:46.833
-Walter was even better than Kenny.
-Crap, I didn't know--

01:05:46.916 --> 01:05:48.041
-I liked Walter.
-Yeah.

01:05:48.833 --> 01:05:49.791
What's his name?

01:05:49.875 --> 01:05:52.833
The one left standing?
That's Andy. Andy, can you say hi?

01:05:52.916 --> 01:05:55.708
-It's actually Andrew, but Andy's fine.
-Just the hi.

01:05:55.791 --> 01:05:56.708
Hi.

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:00.833
I don't like that guy.

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:05.666
Next time, kill And--
What do you prefer? Andrew? Andy?

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:08.791
Either one. At work it's more
professional to go by Andrew.

01:06:08.875 --> 01:06:10.000
My mom calls me Andy.

01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:13.291
Andy-Pandy, but seems
too familiar as I say it out loud.

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:15.750
Lacrosse had three Andrews.
They called me Drew.

01:06:15.833 --> 01:06:17.708
My coach called me
by my middle name, Andy.

01:06:17.791 --> 01:06:18.625
Alright.

01:06:18.708 --> 01:06:21.208
My mom's new boyfriend
loves Andrew Lloyd Webber.

01:06:21.291 --> 01:06:23.458
-So, he just calls me Paul.
-Enough.

01:06:24.541 --> 01:06:25.708
Next time kill Andrew.

01:06:26.375 --> 01:06:28.166
Got it. What's our next move?

01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:30.333
Well, as I like to say,

01:06:31.125 --> 01:06:33.166
when life gives you lemons, make…

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.750
[both] …lemon-flavored napalm.

01:06:34.833 --> 01:06:36.166
It's the greatest saying.

01:06:36.250 --> 01:06:37.916
-Call a news conference.
-Will do.

01:06:39.833 --> 01:06:42.791
-Clean that up, Andy-rew.
-Yeah.

01:06:42.875 --> 01:06:44.500
-Yeah.
-Whatever.

01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:47.000
[The King] I believe in democracy.

01:06:48.208 --> 01:06:52.250
I lost to the better candidate tonight
and as a gesture of goodwill,

01:06:52.333 --> 01:06:56.291
I'm gonna host a celebration
for mayor-elect Gonzales

01:06:56.375 --> 01:06:58.166
and the great city of Chicago.

01:06:58.916 --> 01:07:01.708
Because this city
deserves what's coming to it.

01:07:02.458 --> 01:07:03.500
A party!

01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:06.583
Thank you.

01:07:06.666 --> 01:07:08.500
[reporters murmuring]

01:07:09.916 --> 01:07:11.458
[Frank] Pancakes on the house.

01:07:11.541 --> 01:07:14.208
Look.
Business has picked up thanks to you two.

01:07:14.958 --> 01:07:16.750
So, thank you, Lydia, Emily.

01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:18.166
Welcome.

01:07:18.250 --> 01:07:20.083
-Those suits are great.
-Right?

01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.166
Wish I had one.

01:07:21.250 --> 01:07:23.041
-Alright. Enjoy.
-Thanks.

01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:26.250
Yeah. How about a toast
to the good guys winning the election?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:29.125
Let's not celebrate too fast.

01:07:29.208 --> 01:07:32.166
The King's not throwing a party
out of the goodness of his heart.

01:07:32.250 --> 01:07:33.083
Yeah.

01:07:34.250 --> 01:07:36.916
Excuse me. I'm gonna wash my hands up.

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.083
Not washing her hands.
She's going to the can.

01:07:41.166 --> 01:07:43.750
God knows what she's doing.
I don't wanna know.

01:07:43.833 --> 01:07:47.291
Sometimes I can't picture
certain people doing certain things.

01:07:47.375 --> 01:07:49.291
Know what I mean? Like Obama vacuuming

01:07:49.375 --> 01:07:51.375
or Eleanor Roosevelt flossing--

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:52.875
[explosion]

01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:58.458
-[high-pitched ringing]
-[muffled groaning]

01:07:58.541 --> 01:08:00.708
[muffled clamoring]

01:08:06.083 --> 01:08:07.750
-Em, are you okay?
-What happened?

01:08:08.375 --> 01:08:09.375
Are you okay?

01:08:09.458 --> 01:08:10.958
[sinister music plays]

01:08:23.791 --> 01:08:24.625
Are you okay?

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.333
Frank, stay down.

01:08:28.916 --> 01:08:29.916
Stay down.

01:08:32.208 --> 01:08:34.791
I thought The King wanted
to talk things through.

01:08:35.708 --> 01:08:37.583
I've been let off the leash.

01:08:37.666 --> 01:08:39.541
You need to work on your phrasing,

01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:42.541
because in that scenario,
you just made yourself the dog.

01:08:43.875 --> 01:08:47.000
I'm surprised you ding-dongs
lived through the first blast.

01:08:47.083 --> 01:08:50.791
-You're stronger than I thought.
-Maybe you're weaker than you thought.

01:08:53.250 --> 01:08:54.291
I'm…

01:08:56.208 --> 01:08:57.083
not…

01:08:59.083 --> 01:09:01.208
weak!

01:09:02.166 --> 01:09:03.666
Did she call us ding-dongs?

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.708
Get a shovel.
I'm gonna bury that bitch.

01:09:06.791 --> 01:09:08.833
[grunting]

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:11.541
-No! We just fixed that door!
-Frank, be qui--

01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:13.500
[Frank moaning]

01:09:15.291 --> 01:09:17.750
[Frank] Please, no…

01:09:29.166 --> 01:09:31.583
