00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:11.604
<i>Since the beginning of time,</i>

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:15.441
<i>since the first little girl</i>
<i>ever existed,</i>

00:01:15.474 --> 00:01:18.812
<i>there have been dolls.</i>

00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:24.951
<i>But the dolls were always</i>
<i>and forever baby dolls.</i>

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.754
<i>The girls who played with them</i>

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:31.892
<i>could only ever play</i>
<i>at being mothers.</i>

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:36.629
<i>Which can be fun,</i>
<i>at least for a while, anyway.</i>

00:01:37.898 --> 00:01:39.398
<i>Ask your mother.</i>

00:01:41.902 --> 00:01:43.937
<i>This continued until...</i>

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:54.673
<i>Yes,</i>
<i>Barbie changed everything.</i>

00:02:54.707 --> 00:02:57.643
<i>Then, she changed it all again.</i>

00:02:57.676 --> 00:02:59.778
<i>All of these women are Barbie,</i>

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:03.183
<i>and Barbie is</i>
<i>all of these women.</i>

00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:06.618
<i>She might have started out as</i>
<i>just a lady in a bathing suit,</i>

00:03:06.652 --> 00:03:09.588
<i>but she became so much more.</i>

00:03:09.621 --> 00:03:12.192
<i>She has her own money,</i>
<i>her own house,</i>

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:16.029
<i>her own car, her own career.</i>

00:03:16.062 --> 00:03:20.967
<i>Because Barbie can be anything,</i>
<i>women can be anything.</i>

00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:23.269
<i>And this has</i>
<i>been reflected back</i>

00:03:23.303 --> 00:03:27.307
<i>onto the little girls of today</i>
<i>in the Real World.</i>

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.275
<i>Girls can grow into women,</i>

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.977
<i>who can achieve everything</i>

00:03:31.011 --> 00:03:33.279
<i>and anything</i>
<i>they set their mind to.</i>

00:03:33.313 --> 00:03:35.681
<i>Thanks to Barbie,</i>

00:03:35.714 --> 00:03:41.687
<i>all problems of feminism</i>
<i>and equal rights</i>
<i>have been solved.</i>

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.656
<i>At least</i>
<i>that's what the Barbies think.</i>

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.626

I work very hard,

00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.025

-You're the voice

-I know.

00:07:10.863 --> 00:07:12.865
In our assessment,
money is not speech,

00:07:12.899 --> 00:07:15.835
and corporations have no free
speech rights to begin with.

00:07:15.868 --> 00:07:18.238
So any claim on their part
to be exercising a right

00:07:18.271 --> 00:07:22.008
is just their attempt
to turn our democracy
into a plutocracy.

00:07:23.443 --> 00:07:25.345
This makes me emotional,
and I'm expressing it.

00:07:25.378 --> 00:07:28.481

-You guys are so strong.
-Use your legs. There he is.

-You okay?
-Yep. Totally.

00:09:37.477 --> 00:09:40.246
Looks like this beach
was a little too much beach
for you, Ken.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:41.581
If I wasn't severely injured,

00:09:41.614 --> 00:09:43.649
I would beach you off
right now, Ken.

00:09:43.683 --> 00:09:45.118
I'll beach off with you
any day, Ken.

00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:46.886

00:09:47.687 --> 00:09:49.288

But you don't even know
how to beach yourself off.

00:09:57.663 --> 00:09:59.265
How you gonna beach
both of us off?

00:09:59.298 --> 00:10:01.234
- Uh, Kens?
- It doesn't make sense.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:02.668
-Why are you getting emotional?
-So you can beach yourself off!

00:10:02.702 --> 00:10:05.104
Come on, Kens. Nobody's gonna
beach anyone off.

00:10:05.138 --> 00:10:06.472
Okay?

00:10:06.506 --> 00:10:07.573

00:10:28.661 --> 00:10:29.996

You'll be fine.

00:10:31.764 --> 00:10:34.233

-Thank you, Barbie.
-Yeah.

00:10:39.205 --> 00:10:41.240
-You know
surfer is not even my job.
-I know.

00:10:41.274 --> 00:10:44.410
And it is not lifeguard,
which is
a common misconception.

00:10:44.444 --> 00:10:46.612
-Very common.
-Because actually my job...

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:50.283
-...it's just beach.
-Right.

00:10:50.316 --> 00:10:52.185
And what a good job
you do at beach.

00:10:53.619 --> 00:10:55.188
Actually, in the time
that it took for me

00:10:55.221 --> 00:10:56.689

you healed.

00:10:56.722 --> 00:10:58.424
-Fantastic.
-Nice.

00:10:58.458 --> 00:10:59.559
-Hey, Barbie.
-Yeah?

00:10:59.592 --> 00:11:01.661
Can I come to your house
tonight?

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:03.329
- Sure. I don't have
anything big planned.
- Yes.

00:11:03.362 --> 00:11:05.031
Just a giant blowout party
with all the Barbies

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.532
and planned choreography
and a bespoke song.

00:11:06.566 --> 00:11:08.100
You should stop by.

00:11:08.134 --> 00:11:09.502

00:14:40.947 --> 00:14:42.348
Because
we're girlfriend/boyfriend.

Ken's just
a really good friend.

00:14:52.993 --> 00:14:54.961
And this is my Dreamhouse.
It's Barbie's Dreamhouse.

00:14:54.995 --> 00:14:56.729
It's not Ken's Dreamhouse.
Right?

00:14:56.762 --> 00:14:58.865
Right as always.

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:00.733

have context for this,

but my feet...
my heels are on the ground.

that might be related.

00:18:29.042 --> 00:18:30.877
Bad breath this morning,
a cold shower,

00:18:30.911 --> 00:18:32.478
burnt waffle,
and falling off my roof.

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:33.779

00:18:38.251 --> 00:18:40.887

you've never malfunctioned.

00:18:48.228 --> 00:18:51.497
I heard that she used to be
the most beautiful Barbie
of all,

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:54.733

00:19:37.077 --> 00:19:38.044
<i>Woof.</i>

00:19:38.078 --> 00:19:38.979
Oh.

00:19:39.012 --> 00:19:40.814
<i>Bark.</i>

00:19:42.048 --> 00:19:43.016
<i>Woof.</i>

00:19:44.184 --> 00:19:45.617
<i>Bark.</i>

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:46.719
Hey.

00:19:48.188 --> 00:19:49.889
What's cookin',
good-lookin'?

00:19:49.923 --> 00:19:51.690
-Hi.
-Welcome.

00:19:51.724 --> 00:19:53.126
Welcome to my Weirdhouse.

00:19:57.330 --> 00:19:59.598
-Hi, how are ya?
-Nice to meet you.

00:19:59.631 --> 00:20:01.868
Sorry about the dog crap.
What can I do ya for?

00:20:01.901 --> 00:20:05.171
I just had to come see you
about my feet.

00:20:05.205 --> 00:20:06.638
They're, um...

00:20:12.946 --> 00:20:14.948
-Flat.
-Yeah.

00:20:14.981 --> 00:20:16.816
Never seen that before.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.284
-Really?
-Whoa.

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:21.221
Okay. Well, can you,
you know, fix them?

00:20:21.254 --> 00:20:22.688
You're Stereotypical Barbie,
right?

00:20:22.721 --> 00:20:24.924
Mmm-hmm.

00:20:24.958 --> 00:20:29.129
That Ken of yours,
he is one nice-looking
little protein pot.

00:20:29.162 --> 00:20:31.331
I guess.

00:20:31.364 --> 00:20:34.100
I'd like to see what kind
of nude blob he's packing
under those jeans.

00:20:34.134 --> 00:20:36.970
-Anyway, what preceded this?
-Oh, nothing.

00:20:37.003 --> 00:20:40.840
A really fun game
of volleyball.

00:20:40.874 --> 00:20:43.742
-That's it?
-Thoughts of death.

00:20:43.776 --> 00:20:44.743
What is it?

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:49.182
Maybe some thoughts
of death?

00:20:49.215 --> 00:20:51.051
Thoughts of death!

00:20:51.084 --> 00:20:53.153
-Is that a problem?
-Oh.

00:20:53.186 --> 00:20:54.988
-What?
-I've heard of this.

00:20:55.021 --> 00:20:57.924
Of course, I didn't think
it was possible, but it's real.

00:20:59.826 --> 00:21:02.162
Oh, you've done it.
You've opened a portal.

00:21:02.195 --> 00:21:04.197
I didn't open a portal.

00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:07.934
Someone did.
And now, there is a rip
in the continuum

00:21:07.967 --> 00:21:10.870
that is the membrane between
Barbie Land and the Real World,

00:21:10.904 --> 00:21:13.106
and if you wanna be
Stereotypical Barbie
perfect again,

00:21:13.139 --> 00:21:15.075
then, baby girl,
you gotta go fix it.

00:21:15.108 --> 00:21:19.045
Or you're gonna keep
going funny.
Look at your upper thigh.

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:21.114
- What is that?
- That's cellulite.

00:21:21.147 --> 00:21:23.183
-That's gonna
spread everywhere.
-What?

00:21:23.216 --> 00:21:26.119
And then you're gonna
start getting sad
and mushy and complicated.

00:21:26.152 --> 00:21:27.653
No!

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:28.888
What do I have to do?

00:21:28.922 --> 00:21:30.789
You have to go

00:21:30.824 --> 00:21:32.392
-to the Real World.
-Okay.

00:21:32.425 --> 00:21:34.660
And you have to find the girl
who's playing with you.

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:35.929
Playing with me?

00:21:35.962 --> 00:21:37.696
We're all being played with,
babe.

00:21:37.729 --> 00:21:39.765
But usually there's some kind
of separation. Thanks.

00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:43.136
There's the girl and the doll.
And never the twain
shall cross.

00:21:43.169 --> 00:21:45.071
-The twain is crossing?
-Yes.

00:21:45.105 --> 00:21:47.207
And the girl who's playing
with you, she must be sad,

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:49.175
and her thoughts and feelings
and humanness

00:21:49.209 --> 00:21:51.344
are interfering
with your dollness.

00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:53.179
Why would she be sad?

00:21:53.213 --> 00:21:56.015
We fixed everything so that
all women in the Real World

00:21:56.049 --> 00:21:57.383
can be happy and powerful.

00:21:57.417 --> 00:21:59.152
I don't know,
but if you ask me,

00:21:59.185 --> 00:22:01.087
-you had something
to do with this, too.
-Me?

00:22:01.121 --> 00:22:02.889
-Takes two to rip a portal.
-I can't have.

00:22:02.922 --> 00:22:04.190
I've only ever wanted

00:22:04.224 --> 00:22:06.126
for everything
to stay exactly as it is.

00:22:06.159 --> 00:22:07.861
Well, be that as it may,

00:22:07.894 --> 00:22:10.997
the two of you are becoming
inextricably intertwined.

00:22:11.030 --> 00:22:13.032
And you gotta help her
to help yourself.

00:22:19.172 --> 00:22:20.440
So, should-- Whoo!

00:22:20.473 --> 00:22:22.075
So, what'll it be then?

00:22:22.108 --> 00:22:23.675
You can go
back to your regular life

00:22:23.709 --> 00:22:25.245
and forget any of this
ever happened,

00:22:25.278 --> 00:22:28.181
or you can know the truth
about the universe.

00:22:29.182 --> 00:22:32.452
The choice is now yours.

00:22:32.485 --> 00:22:34.287
The first one. The high heel.

00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.290
No. We'll do a re-do.

00:22:37.323 --> 00:22:38.424
You're supposed to
want to know.

00:22:38.458 --> 00:22:39.893
I don't.

00:22:39.926 --> 00:22:41.327
Mmm. Babe, listen.

00:22:41.361 --> 00:22:43.196
You have to want to know, okay?
Do it again.

00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:45.465
I'm not Adventure Barbie.
I'm Stereotypical Barbie.

00:22:45.498 --> 00:22:47.000
I'm like the Barbie
you think of

00:22:47.033 --> 00:22:48.734
when someone says,
"Think of a Barbie."

00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:51.104
That's me.

00:22:51.137 --> 00:22:54.107
I'm bummed. You're a bummer.
That's a bummer.

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.176
Okay, I'm ready to forget now.

00:22:56.209 --> 00:22:58.710
No! You're doing this one!

00:22:58.744 --> 00:23:01.414
I just gave you a choice
so you could feel
some sense of control.

00:23:01.447 --> 00:23:03.416
-So there is no option one?
-No!

00:23:03.449 --> 00:23:06.785
You have to fix the rip
yourself.

00:23:06.819 --> 00:23:08.488
Don't blame me, blame Mattel.
They make the rules.

00:23:08.521 --> 00:23:10.756
Oh, I don't want to.

00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:12.225
Fine, get cellulite.
I don't care.

00:23:12.258 --> 00:23:14.460
No! No, no, no.
No. Okay. Yeah.

00:23:17.763 --> 00:23:20.266
Send me through the portal.

00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:21.868
Okay.
There's actually no portal.

00:23:21.901 --> 00:23:23.269
-Oh.
-It's a figure of speech.

00:23:23.303 --> 00:23:26.005
It's actually a sports car
to a speedboat,

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:28.774
to a rocket ship,
to a tandem bike,

00:23:28.808 --> 00:23:31.311
to a camper van, fun,
to a snowmobile, brr,

00:23:31.344 --> 00:23:32.879
which will take you
most of the way

00:23:32.912 --> 00:23:34.380
to the state of Los Angeles,

00:23:34.414 --> 00:23:36.382
where you will don neon
and Rollerblades,

00:23:36.416 --> 00:23:38.952
and enter
the country of California.

00:23:38.985 --> 00:23:41.187
Weird, I know. Best if you
don't think about it too much.

00:23:41.221 --> 00:23:43.923
And then when I get there,
how do I find this girl?

00:23:44.857 --> 00:23:46.826
You will know.

00:23:46.859 --> 00:23:49.095
Okay. And how do I get back?

00:23:49.128 --> 00:23:50.997
The same way you came,
but in reverse.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.900
Like I should move forward but
do the order backward or go--

00:23:53.933 --> 00:23:55.902
-Don't overthink it.
-Oh. Okay.

00:23:55.935 --> 00:24:00.139
For you see, if you do not
find her and fix things,

00:24:00.173 --> 00:24:02.075
what's ugly will become uglier,

00:24:02.108 --> 00:24:04.010
and what's weird
will become weirder.

00:24:04.043 --> 00:24:05.912
And then you'll look like me.

00:24:05.945 --> 00:24:07.113
Ahh! Oh.

00:24:08.181 --> 00:24:10.016
Sorry.

00:24:10.049 --> 00:24:12.218
I understand.
I set myself up for that.

00:24:12.252 --> 00:24:14.487
-Anyway, I believe in you.
-Thank you.

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:17.357
Go. Be careful. I love you.

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.459
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:24:19.492 --> 00:24:21.793
Bon voyage to reality,

00:24:21.828 --> 00:24:24.464
and good luck
restoring the membrane

00:24:24.497 --> 00:24:27.300
that separates
our world from theirs

00:24:27.333 --> 00:24:29.402
so you don't get cellulite!

00:24:31.571 --> 00:24:34.073
-I guess she's going
without you.
-You're so lost, Ken.

00:24:34.107 --> 00:24:36.509
She literally asked me.

00:24:36.542 --> 00:24:38.878
And I was like,
"I prefer to stay here."

00:24:38.911 --> 00:24:40.146
Why? Are you scared?

00:24:40.179 --> 00:24:42.181
- No.
- I bet you're scared.

00:24:42.215 --> 00:24:45.018
And I bet she doesn't
even want you to go.

00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:46.552
Well, you bet
both those things incorrectly,

00:24:46.586 --> 00:24:48.421
and I bet
in the opposite direction.

00:24:48.454 --> 00:24:49.922
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:51.057
Which way is that?

00:24:51.958 --> 00:24:54.093
You don't even know.

00:24:54.127 --> 00:24:56.229
I just don't want to leave.
I'm trying to find reasons
not to leave.

00:24:56.262 --> 00:24:57.397
Please stay.

00:24:57.430 --> 00:24:59.198
I'm gonna miss you guys
so much.

00:24:59.232 --> 00:25:01.301
I just wish someone could come
with me, but you can't.

00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:02.535
I should do this alone.

00:25:02.568 --> 00:25:04.103
-What bird am I thinking of?
-Parrot.

00:25:04.137 --> 00:25:05.571
Dolphin. I mean, no, a bird.

00:25:06.539 --> 00:25:07.473
Pelican.

00:25:07.507 --> 00:25:09.142
-Ohh.
-Man.

00:25:09.175 --> 00:25:11.177
We'll miss you, Barbie.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:12.412
I'll be back in no time,
with perfect feet,

00:25:12.445 --> 00:25:14.514
and we'll forget
that this ever happened.

00:25:14.547 --> 00:25:16.382
And you'll get to see
all the good work
we've done to fix the world.

00:25:16.416 --> 00:25:18.217
You'll be such a hero to them.

00:25:18.251 --> 00:25:20.119
All those grateful,
powerful women

00:25:20.153 --> 00:25:22.388
who owe their wonderful lives
to Barbie.

00:25:22.422 --> 00:25:24.490
I'll bet every woman
will say thank you

00:25:24.524 --> 00:25:26.259
and give you a really big hug.

00:25:26.292 --> 00:25:29.996
Yes, you're right. Here I go.

00:25:30.029 --> 00:25:31.397
-Bye.
-Yay!

00:25:31.431 --> 00:25:33.866
-Bye, Barbie.
-Bye.

00:25:35.268 --> 00:25:37.537
Bye, Barbie.
Good luck in reality.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.206

00:26:18.077 --> 00:26:20.279
-No. Please get out.
-I can't.

00:26:20.313 --> 00:26:22.014
I made a double bet with Ken,

00:26:22.048 --> 00:26:24.917
and you can't make me
look uncool in front of Ken.

00:26:24.951 --> 00:26:26.252
Ken's not cool!

00:26:26.285 --> 00:26:27.453
He is to me.

00:26:27.487 --> 00:26:29.188
You're just gonna slow me down.

00:26:29.222 --> 00:26:31.290
Barbie, what if there's beach?

00:26:31.324 --> 00:26:33.359
You'll need someone
who's a professional in that.

00:26:35.595 --> 00:26:37.964
Did you bring
your Rollerblades?

00:26:37.997 --> 00:26:39.665
I literally go nowhere
without them.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:43.436
-Please?
-Okay.

00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:45.004
Wow.

00:26:45.037 --> 00:26:46.606
Let's do this.

00:26:46.639 --> 00:26:48.074
-Can I sit in the front?
-No.

00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:51.677

Yes!

00:27:39.692 --> 00:27:42.061
Wow.
This is the Real World.

00:27:42.094 --> 00:27:44.397
Barbie, I told you
there'd be beach.

00:27:44.430 --> 00:27:45.298
Yeah.

00:27:52.138 --> 00:27:53.172
Hmm.

00:27:53.206 --> 00:27:55.441
Oh, yeah!

00:27:57.243 --> 00:27:58.611
What's going on?

00:27:58.644 --> 00:28:00.613
Give us a smile, blondie.

00:28:02.215 --> 00:28:03.649
Why are these men
looking at me?

00:28:03.683 --> 00:28:05.384
Yeah, they're also
staring at me.

00:28:05.418 --> 00:28:06.719
Ooh, love that!

00:28:06.752 --> 00:28:08.321
Wow!

00:28:08.354 --> 00:28:11.257
I feel kind of
ill at ease.
Like...

00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:12.758
I don't know the word for it,
but I'm...

00:28:12.792 --> 00:28:14.527
Nice leotard.

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:17.597
...conscious, but it's myself
that I'm conscious of.

00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:19.198
I'm not getting
any of that.

00:28:19.232 --> 00:28:21.400
I feel what could only
be described as admired.

00:28:21.434 --> 00:28:23.436
- Damn, girl!
- But not ogled.

00:28:23.469 --> 00:28:24.670
You're hot.

00:28:24.704 --> 00:28:26.239
And there's no undertone
of violence.

00:28:26.272 --> 00:28:29.208
Mine very much has
an undertone of violence.

00:28:29.242 --> 00:28:30.776
Oh, look, a construction site.

00:28:30.811 --> 00:28:32.712
We need
that good feminine energy.

00:28:32.745 --> 00:28:35.147
-Yeah.
-Ladies! Yoo-hoo.

00:28:35.181 --> 00:28:37.149
-Oh.
-You got fries with that shake?

00:28:37.183 --> 00:28:39.118
If I said you had a hot body,
would you hold it against me?

00:28:39.151 --> 00:28:40.419
Have I died
and gone to heaven?

00:28:40.453 --> 00:28:42.288
Is that a mirror
in your pocket?

00:28:42.321 --> 00:28:44.423
-Baby, you are an angel.
-I can see myself
in your shorts.

00:28:44.457 --> 00:28:46.192
I don't know exactly
what you meant
with all of those little quips,

00:28:46.225 --> 00:28:48.160
but I'm picking up
on some sort of entendre,

00:28:48.194 --> 00:28:49.729
which appears to be double,

00:28:49.762 --> 00:28:51.397
and I would just like
to inform you,

00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:54.667
I do not have a vagina.

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.769
And he does not have a penis.

00:28:56.803 --> 00:28:58.604
We don't have genitals.

00:28:58.638 --> 00:29:00.072
-That's okay.
-Yeah.

00:29:00.106 --> 00:29:01.808
-Yeah, whatever. Yeah.
-It's cool.

00:29:01.842 --> 00:29:04.343
I have all the genitals.

00:29:04.377 --> 00:29:06.679
Geez, you would think
a construction site
at lunch time

00:29:06.712 --> 00:29:09.081
would be the perfect place
for a little woman power,

00:29:09.115 --> 00:29:13.152
but this one was so... male.

00:29:13.185 --> 00:29:17.256
Everything is almost like...
reversed here.

00:29:19.692 --> 00:29:20.626
Oh, look!

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:21.794
The Supreme Court.

00:29:21.828 --> 00:29:23.596
- They're so smart.
- Yeah.

00:29:23.629 --> 00:29:26.332
- Yeah, bruh!
- Do it, bro!

00:29:30.837 --> 00:29:32.806
I love me a leotard.

00:29:32.839 --> 00:29:34.507
I love the elbow pads.

00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.576
I think we should get
some different clothes.

00:29:38.744 --> 00:29:40.346
We look great.

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:41.848
-I love fringe.
-I love denim.

00:29:41.882 --> 00:29:43.249
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:29:43.783 --> 00:29:45.217
Hey, man.

00:29:45.251 --> 00:29:47.386
You guys gotta pay
for that stuff.

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:51.691
She looks even better
in more clothes.

00:29:51.724 --> 00:29:53.392
Because you can imagine more.

00:29:53.426 --> 00:29:55.896
You know what? Keep 'em.

00:29:55.929 --> 00:29:58.431
Weird Barbie said I would know
how to find this girl,

00:29:58.464 --> 00:30:00.366
but I have no idea.

00:30:00.399 --> 00:30:01.434
Hmm.

00:30:01.467 --> 00:30:03.402
What would a smart Barbie do?

00:30:03.436 --> 00:30:05.671
I just need to clear my mind
so I can think.

00:30:05.705 --> 00:30:07.740
Who is playing with me?

00:30:07.773 --> 00:30:09.742
I hate it when people think.
I get so bored.

00:30:09.775 --> 00:30:12.178
Faster I figure it out,
the faster we get to go home.

00:30:12.211 --> 00:30:14.413
-What am I supposed to do?
-Ken!

00:30:14.447 --> 00:30:15.916
-Go for a walk or something.
-By myself?

00:30:15.949 --> 00:30:17.550
-Yes.
-Really? Where?

00:30:17.583 --> 00:30:18.784
Anywhere.

00:30:18.819 --> 00:30:20.586
-Can I go that way?
-Yes. Okay.

00:30:26.459 --> 00:30:27.861
-Don't go far.
-Okay!

00:30:32.632 --> 00:30:33.699
Excuse me, sir.

00:30:34.734 --> 00:30:36.369
Thanks, man.

00:30:46.679 --> 00:30:48.547
What's up, man?

00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:50.249
-We've got to man up
on this one.
-Great workout, man.

00:30:50.282 --> 00:30:51.584
Men, men, men.

00:30:51.617 --> 00:30:54.186
-You're the man!
-No, <i>you're</i> the man!

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.554
Men, men, men!

00:31:05.564 --> 00:31:08.434
Based on the ROI,
we are exceeding expectations.

00:31:08.467 --> 00:31:10.503
-Good stuff.
So I'm not worried about it.
-Excuse me--

00:31:10.536 --> 00:31:12.605
Not now, Margaret.
Let's shake on this.

00:31:12.638 --> 00:31:14.440
-We are gonna make
a lot of money.
-We are officially important.

00:31:37.030 --> 00:31:38.297
Yes!

00:32:46.365 --> 00:32:47.433
That felt...

00:32:48.634 --> 00:32:50.837
...achy, but good.

00:32:59.779 --> 00:33:01.714
- I'm actually trying
to make this work.

00:33:01.747 --> 00:33:03.083
How?
By calling me a lunatic?

00:33:03.116 --> 00:33:04.818
That's not
how you make things work.

00:33:04.851 --> 00:33:05.986
I don't know what this is all--

00:33:45.758 --> 00:33:46.993
You're so beautiful.

00:33:48.794 --> 00:33:49.896
I know it.

00:33:57.103 --> 00:33:59.505
Barbie! Barbie!

00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:00.606
Yes!

00:34:00.639 --> 00:34:01.540
I've got it!

00:34:01.574 --> 00:34:02.675
Oh, what do you got?

00:34:02.708 --> 00:34:03.977
-You go first.
-No, no, you go.

00:34:04.010 --> 00:34:05.778
-We'll go at the same time.
-Okay.

00:34:05.812 --> 00:34:07.646
-She's at school.
-Men rule the world!

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.515
-What was that?
-The kid's at the school?

00:34:09.548 --> 00:34:10.549
But what did you say?

00:34:10.583 --> 00:34:11.918
-Nothing.
-Okay.

00:34:11.952 --> 00:34:13.920
-Well, let's go to the school.
-Okay!

00:34:13.954 --> 00:34:15.454
Now, come on.

00:34:33.006 --> 00:34:35.008
-Hello.
-This is Dan of the FBI.

00:34:35.041 --> 00:34:36.742
Oh. This is Aaron at Mattel.

00:34:36.775 --> 00:34:38.410
I don't give a flying squirrel
who you are, Aaron.

00:34:38.444 --> 00:34:40.146
-What are you, like an intern?
-No, I'm--

00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:41.848
Two of your dolls
have gotten loose.

00:34:41.882 --> 00:34:43.149
Impossible.

00:34:43.183 --> 00:34:44.818
-How do you know?
-Don't sass me, Aaron.

00:34:44.851 --> 00:34:46.785
Couple of blondes,
answering to Barbie and Ken.

00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.487
Rollerblading in Santa Monica.

00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.522
<i>We're gonna need Mattel's help</i>
<i>landing the eagle.</i>

00:34:50.556 --> 00:34:51.925
<i>Don't crap the bed, Aaron!</i>

00:34:51.958 --> 00:34:52.926
I won't.

00:34:55.628 --> 00:34:57.630
This is bad.
This is really bad.

00:34:57.663 --> 00:34:59.598
- What?
This happened before.

00:34:59.632 --> 00:35:01.134
What? When?

00:35:01.167 --> 00:35:03.169
I heard about ten years ago,
a woman named Skipper

00:35:03.203 --> 00:35:05.071
turned up at some family's home
in Key West.

00:35:05.105 --> 00:35:07.007
Asked to babysit the kids.

00:35:07.040 --> 00:35:08.674
She then tried to take
their toddler surfing.

00:35:08.707 --> 00:35:10.509
-Geez.
-I know.

00:35:10.542 --> 00:35:11.443
They were able to straighten
it out, keep it under wraps,

00:35:11.477 --> 00:35:14.513
but this is serious.

00:35:14.546 --> 00:35:16.615
-I'm going all the way up.
-No one goes all the way up.

00:35:16.649 --> 00:35:18.651
-I have to.
-You may never come back.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:21.121
I know.

00:35:31.097 --> 00:35:34.667
♪ Closer I am to fine

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:37.070
Oh.

00:35:37.103 --> 00:35:38.939
-Hey.
-Oh, hi, Aaron.

00:35:38.972 --> 00:35:40.539
-New drawings?
-Yeah.

00:35:40.572 --> 00:35:43.209
I just started drawing
these weird designs.

00:35:43.243 --> 00:35:44.777
These are different.

00:35:44.811 --> 00:35:47.613
It's Irrepressible
Thoughts of Death Barbie.

00:35:47.646 --> 00:35:49.715
Full Body Cellulite Barbie.

00:35:49.748 --> 00:35:51.818
Crippling Shame Barbie.

00:35:51.851 --> 00:35:54.753
Okay. Listen, I have to
speak to the top brass.

00:35:54.787 --> 00:35:55.889
-No.
-I must.

00:35:55.922 --> 00:35:58.024
-No.
-I'm going to.

00:35:58.058 --> 00:36:00.659
Aaron, they're
in a big corporate idea sesh.
No one is to be admitted.

00:36:00.693 --> 00:36:02.695
-Aaron! Aaron! Aaron, stop!
-...always be empowering girls.

00:36:02.728 --> 00:36:04.197
Always!

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:05.966
But what do we really sell?
I'll tell you what.

00:36:05.999 --> 00:36:07.599
- We sell dreams.
Aaron.

00:36:07.633 --> 00:36:08.902
And imagination!

00:36:10.103 --> 00:36:11.938
And sparkle!

00:36:11.972 --> 00:36:14.007
I get excited. I'm passionate.

00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:16.775
And when you think of sparkle,
what do you think of
after that?

00:36:16.810 --> 00:36:18.011
Female agency.

00:36:19.079 --> 00:36:21.081
Excuse me.

00:36:21.114 --> 00:36:23.515
-Who are you?
-Aaron Dinkins, sir.

00:36:23.549 --> 00:36:25.584
We're in the middle of a major
sit-down here, Aaron Dinkins.

00:36:25.617 --> 00:36:27.187
I think you're gonna want
to hear this, sir.

00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:30.023
Can you just e-mail it?
And you can send it to me EOD.

00:36:30.056 --> 00:36:31.157
End of day.

00:36:31.191 --> 00:36:33.093
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

00:36:33.126 --> 00:36:36.595
May I put it
in a whisper, sir?

00:36:36.628 --> 00:36:37.730
Fine. Whisper me.

00:37:00.887 --> 00:37:02.055
No. No!

00:37:02.088 --> 00:37:04.224
Ahh! Ahh! No.

00:37:04.257 --> 00:37:05.724
- Get the chair!
- Take the cart.

00:37:05.758 --> 00:37:06.725
They're okay.

00:37:08.161 --> 00:37:09.863
-You all right?
-He's okay.

00:37:09.896 --> 00:37:11.131
-Okay.
-He's okay.

00:37:14.334 --> 00:37:16.336
It's a repeat
of Skipper in Key West.

00:37:16.369 --> 00:37:20.106
And with all due respect,
that was Skipper, sir.

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:22.842
This is... Barbie.

00:37:25.078 --> 00:37:26.913
If this got out

00:37:26.946 --> 00:37:29.149
that our dolls were coming
to Los Angeles from Barbie Land

00:37:29.182 --> 00:37:31.583
as life-size versions
of themselves...

00:37:32.819 --> 00:37:34.620
roaming the earth...

00:37:35.855 --> 00:37:37.924
this would be very bad.

00:37:37.957 --> 00:37:40.160
Barbie in the Real World?

00:37:41.327 --> 00:37:42.929
That's impossible.

00:37:42.962 --> 00:37:45.165
We've got a definite situation
on our hands.

00:37:45.198 --> 00:37:47.067
Catastrophic!

00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:50.370
-I can't stress that enough!
-What?

00:37:50.403 --> 00:37:52.305
-What's your name again?
-Aaron Dinkins, sir.

00:37:52.338 --> 00:37:53.807
-Aaron Dickinson?
-Dinkins.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.108
Yes! Aaron.

00:37:55.141 --> 00:37:56.708
Is Barbie Land
like an alternate reality

00:37:56.742 --> 00:37:59.212
or is it like a place
where your imagination--

00:37:59.245 --> 00:38:00.313
Yes!

00:38:00.346 --> 00:38:01.948
Okay.

00:38:01.981 --> 00:38:05.018
Think of it as a town
in Sweden, Aaron Dinkins.

00:38:05.051 --> 00:38:06.319
Sweden.

00:38:06.352 --> 00:38:07.887
Right.

00:38:09.688 --> 00:38:10.990
How much do you weigh?

00:38:11.024 --> 00:38:13.059
It doesn't matter.

00:38:13.093 --> 00:38:14.660
Sounds like a job for the box.

00:38:14.693 --> 00:38:19.365
No one rests until this doll
is back in a box.

00:38:21.101 --> 00:38:22.135
Look, Davy Crockett
Junior High School,

00:38:22.168 --> 00:38:23.336
just like I saw in my vision.

00:38:23.369 --> 00:38:24.938
A man on a horse.

00:38:24.971 --> 00:38:26.738
I've started to get all these
weirdo feelings.

00:38:26.772 --> 00:38:29.675
Like, I have fear
with no specific object.

00:38:29.708 --> 00:38:31.643
-What is that?
-It's anxiety.

00:38:31.677 --> 00:38:33.947
I have it too.
They're just awful at this age.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:35.681
I feel amazing.

00:38:35.714 --> 00:38:37.884
That's because kids don't
take it out on the dads.

00:38:37.917 --> 00:38:40.120
She's gotta
be here somewhere.

00:38:40.153 --> 00:38:41.387
I need to find her soon.

00:38:41.421 --> 00:38:43.289
I'm just gonna pop
into the library

00:38:43.323 --> 00:38:44.991
and see if I can find
any books on trucks.

00:38:45.024 --> 00:38:46.359
Okay, just don't
get in trouble.

00:38:46.392 --> 00:38:48.962
I won't!

00:38:48.995 --> 00:38:51.730
<i>- ♪ Johnny, my baby, did it</i>
<i>always have to end this way? ♪</i>

00:38:51.763 --> 00:38:54.067
<i>♪ 'Cause one day ♪</i>

00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:57.237
<i>- ♪ One day, my baby</i>
<i>just went away ♪</i>

00:39:00.073 --> 00:39:01.908
<i>♪ My angel ♪</i>

00:39:01.941 --> 00:39:03.276
What are you doing?

00:39:03.309 --> 00:39:06.112
Oh, uh,
what's that girl's name?

00:39:06.146 --> 00:39:07.447
That's Sasha.

00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.747
Hey, Sasha!

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.682
-Don't talk to her.
-Oh.

00:39:10.716 --> 00:39:12.819
Sasha can talk to you,
but you can
never talk to Sasha.

00:39:12.852 --> 00:39:14.988
-She'll crush you.
-Don't worry.

00:39:15.021 --> 00:39:17.190
Everyone really likes me
and thinks I'm cool and pretty.

00:39:18.091 --> 00:39:19.159
Huh.

00:39:19.192 --> 00:39:20.193
Thank you.

00:39:23.363 --> 00:39:26.933
Hey, ladies. Sasha, what's up?

00:39:29.435 --> 00:39:30.702
Who are you?

00:39:33.406 --> 00:39:36.910
I'm only your favorite woman
of all time.

00:39:36.943 --> 00:39:38.777
Barbie!

00:39:40.013 --> 00:39:42.482
You really think you're Barbie?

00:39:42.515 --> 00:39:44.184
-Yeah.
-She's crazy.

00:39:44.217 --> 00:39:46.052
Do you think she escaped
from like an insane asylum?

00:39:46.085 --> 00:39:47.921
So you're like "Barbie" Barbie?
Like a professional bimbo?

00:39:47.954 --> 00:39:49.389
No. Barbie's not a bimbo.

00:39:49.422 --> 00:39:51.757
Barbie is a doctor and a lawyer
and a senator

00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:53.359
and a Nobel Prize winner.

00:39:53.393 --> 00:39:55.094
You're a Nobel Prize winner?

00:39:55.128 --> 00:39:58.831
Oh. No, not me,
but Barbie is.

00:39:58.865 --> 00:40:00.766
Yeah.

00:40:00.799 --> 00:40:03.903
Aren't you guys gonna thank me
and give me a big hug?

00:40:05.505 --> 00:40:07.773
For being your favorite toy?

00:40:07.807 --> 00:40:10.776
We haven't played with Barbie
since we were
like five years old.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:12.744
Yeah, I hated dolls with hair.

00:40:12.778 --> 00:40:14.780
I mean, I'd play with Barbie,
but it was, like,
the last resort.

00:40:14.814 --> 00:40:16.049
I loved Barbie.

00:40:16.082 --> 00:40:18.051
Oh.

00:40:18.084 --> 00:40:20.353
Anyways, even then,
it was horrible for us.

00:40:20.386 --> 00:40:21.454
It was horrible?

00:40:23.022 --> 00:40:24.290
Why?

00:40:24.324 --> 00:40:25.525
-Come on, Sasha.
-Give it to her.

00:40:25.558 --> 00:40:27.126
Destroy Barbie.

00:40:28.194 --> 00:40:31.898
Okay, Barbie, let's do this.

00:40:31.931 --> 00:40:35.134
You've been making women
feel bad about themselves
since you were invented.

00:40:35.168 --> 00:40:37.003
I think you have that
the wrong way around.

00:40:37.036 --> 00:40:39.439
You represent everything wrong
with our culture.

00:40:39.472 --> 00:40:42.976
Sexualized capitalism,
unrealistic physical ideals...

00:40:43.009 --> 00:40:46.212
No, no, no. You're describing
something stereotypical.

00:40:46.246 --> 00:40:49.215
Barbie is so much more
than that.

00:40:49.249 --> 00:40:51.451
Look at yourself.

00:40:51.484 --> 00:40:54.420
Well, I am technically
Stereotypical Barbie.

00:40:54.454 --> 00:40:57.056
You set the feminist movement
back 50 years.

00:40:57.090 --> 00:40:59.125
You destroy
girls' innate sense of worth

00:40:59.158 --> 00:41:00.827
and you are killing the planet

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:02.862
with your glorification
of rampant consumerism.

00:41:02.895 --> 00:41:07.066
No, I'm supposed to help you
and make you happy
and powerful.

00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.935
Oh, I am powerful.

00:41:08.968 --> 00:41:11.070
And until you showed up here
and declared yourself Barbie,

00:41:11.104 --> 00:41:13.406
I hadn't thought about you
in years, you fascist!

00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.412
Oh. Um...

00:41:20.313 --> 00:41:21.914
Okay.

00:41:21.948 --> 00:41:24.317
It's happening again.
I have to--

00:41:24.350 --> 00:41:26.185
Will you excuse me?

00:41:26.219 --> 00:41:28.454
It was really nice
talking to you.

00:41:35.628 --> 00:41:37.163
They never listen.

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:52.879
Excuse me, sir,
do you have the time?

00:41:53.613 --> 00:41:55.114
You respect me.

00:41:55.148 --> 00:41:57.150
Sorry, no,
do you know what time it is?

00:41:57.984 --> 00:41:59.419
No, I do not.

00:42:01.054 --> 00:42:02.322
Okay.

00:42:02.355 --> 00:42:03.923
Why didn't Barbie tell me
about patriarchy,

00:42:03.956 --> 00:42:05.291
which, to my understanding,

00:42:05.325 --> 00:42:07.927
is where men and horses
run everything?

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.362
Sure.

00:42:09.395 --> 00:42:11.197
I shall seek my fortune there.

00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:14.233
All right. So...

00:42:14.267 --> 00:42:16.969
I'll take a high-level,
high-paying job
with influence, please.

00:42:17.003 --> 00:42:18.271
Okay, you'll need
at least an MBA.

00:42:18.304 --> 00:42:19.906
And a lot of our people
have PhDs.

00:42:19.939 --> 00:42:21.374
Isn't being a man enough?

00:42:21.407 --> 00:42:23.142
Actually, right now,
it's kind of the opposite.

00:42:23.176 --> 00:42:26.079
You guys are clearly not doing
patriarchy very well.

00:42:26.112 --> 00:42:29.148
No!
No. We're, uh...

00:42:29.182 --> 00:42:32.552
We're doing it well, yeah.
We just... hide it better now.

00:42:32.585 --> 00:42:34.487
Oh.

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.057
No, I won't let you do
just one appendectomy.

00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:39.459
-But I'm a man.
-But not a doctor.

00:42:39.492 --> 00:42:41.194
-Please?
-No.

00:42:41.227 --> 00:42:42.628
-Can I talk to a doctor?
-You are talking to a doctor.

00:42:42.662 --> 00:42:44.197
-Can you get me a coffee?
-No.

00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:45.264
-And I need a clicky pen.
-No.

00:42:45.298 --> 00:42:46.366
-And a white coat.
-No.

00:42:46.399 --> 00:42:48.034
-And a sharp thing.
-No.

00:42:48.067 --> 00:42:49.335
-There he is. Doctor!
-Somebody get security.

00:42:49.369 --> 00:42:51.537
I'd like to apply
for your job of beach.

00:42:51.571 --> 00:42:53.206
So, you want to be a lifeguard?

00:42:53.239 --> 00:42:55.675
Oh. I'm not trained
to go over there.

00:42:55.708 --> 00:42:58.010
I'm trained to stand
confidently right here.

00:42:58.044 --> 00:42:59.645
There's nobody in danger here.

00:42:59.679 --> 00:43:02.081
And even if there were,
I'm not trained to save them.

00:43:02.115 --> 00:43:03.383
Then I can't hire you.

00:43:03.416 --> 00:43:05.318
I can't even beach here!

00:43:09.555 --> 00:43:12.024
She thinks I'm a fascist?

00:43:12.058 --> 00:43:16.162
I don't control the railways
or the flow of commerce.

00:43:18.564 --> 00:43:19.966
-There you are.
-Oh, no.

00:43:19.999 --> 00:43:21.667
That went terrible.

00:43:21.701 --> 00:43:25.204
I need to find somewhere where
I can start patriarchy fresh.

00:43:29.008 --> 00:43:30.076
Miss Barbie?

00:43:30.109 --> 00:43:31.444
It's just Barbie.

00:43:31.477 --> 00:43:33.212
We're gonna need you
to come with us.

00:43:33.246 --> 00:43:35.214
Oh.

00:43:35.248 --> 00:43:37.016
-Who are you?
-We're Mattel.

00:43:37.049 --> 00:43:38.718
-Mattel?
-Mattel.

00:43:38.751 --> 00:43:40.520
Oh, thank goodness!

00:43:40.553 --> 00:43:42.555
I've gotta talk
to somebody in charge.

00:43:42.588 --> 00:43:44.157
Everything is backwards here.

00:43:44.190 --> 00:43:46.025
Men look at me
like I'm an object.

00:43:46.058 --> 00:43:47.627
Girls hate me.

00:43:47.660 --> 00:43:49.962
Everyone thinks I'm crazy,
and I keep getting arrested.

00:43:49.996 --> 00:43:51.230
Need you to step this way,
ma'am.

00:43:51.264 --> 00:43:52.999
I also just learned to cry.

00:43:53.032 --> 00:43:55.101
First, I got one tear
and then I got a whole bunch.

00:43:55.134 --> 00:43:56.702
What do I do?
Do I follow Barbie

00:43:56.736 --> 00:43:59.472
into that scary unmarked
black truck car?

00:43:59.505 --> 00:44:02.375
A truck car
I'd like to have, actually.

00:44:02.408 --> 00:44:05.378
You're right, she's fine.
It's Mattel.

00:44:05.411 --> 00:44:07.547
- Yeah.
- I know.

00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:09.449
I'll go back to Barbie Land,
and I'll tell the Kens
what I've learned.

00:44:09.482 --> 00:44:10.683
Oh, it's going to be beautiful!

00:44:11.717 --> 00:44:13.286
Okay.

00:44:13.319 --> 00:44:14.520
-Back to Barbie Land.
-Let's go that way.

00:44:16.055 --> 00:44:17.990
-Hi, Bunny Boo-Boo.
-Don't call me that.

00:44:18.024 --> 00:44:20.593
Sorry. I'm off early
because of a crisis at work,

00:44:20.626 --> 00:44:23.396
but I thought we could
go get some soft serve.

00:44:23.429 --> 00:44:26.032
Thank God
they arrested that nutjob.

00:44:26.065 --> 00:44:27.233
Um, um...

00:44:27.266 --> 00:44:29.435
that reality-challenged woman.

00:44:29.469 --> 00:44:30.636
She thinks she's Barbie.

00:44:30.670 --> 00:44:32.371
Wait, what did you say?

00:44:32.405 --> 00:44:35.208
She thinks she's Barbie.
She's, like, fully convinced.

00:44:36.609 --> 00:44:38.511
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

00:44:38.544 --> 00:44:40.213
Mom. Mom!

00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:43.149
Mom, get back in the car!

00:44:45.051 --> 00:44:46.352
Are you kidding me?

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.121
Mom!

00:44:51.257 --> 00:44:54.760
Mattel! Of course it was
you guys that brought me here.

00:44:54.794 --> 00:44:58.064
Because it definitely wasn't
that Sasha girl.

00:44:58.097 --> 00:45:00.333
Thanks for the ride.
This has been so much fun.

00:45:00.366 --> 00:45:03.503
Wow, the mothership!

00:45:08.174 --> 00:45:10.610
-Barbie!
-We're so happy to see you.

00:45:10.643 --> 00:45:12.778
- Hi!
-  -Would you like some mineral water?

00:45:12.813 --> 00:45:14.247
Yes, thank you.

00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:15.515
Oh, thanks.

00:45:18.217 --> 00:45:20.219
I'm not used to that
having anything in it.

00:45:24.156 --> 00:45:26.292
Thank you.

00:45:26.325 --> 00:45:28.361
So, we've been very anxious
to get some quality
face-time with you.

00:45:28.394 --> 00:45:29.830
Of course.
So what can I do

00:45:29.863 --> 00:45:32.231
to repair the rift
in the space-time continuum,

00:45:32.265 --> 00:45:34.133
get my feet back,
and that one cellulite gone,

00:45:34.166 --> 00:45:36.669
and just generally not
turn into Weird Barbie?

00:45:36.702 --> 00:45:40.106
We have been discussing
that very topic.

00:45:40.139 --> 00:45:42.608
If you're agreeable to it,
we would love it

00:45:42.642 --> 00:45:46.279
if you could just get
into that giant box.

00:45:49.315 --> 00:45:51.250
Get into the box and you'll go
back to Barbie Land.

00:45:51.284 --> 00:45:53.653
And everything will be
as it was.

00:45:53.686 --> 00:45:56.255
You know what? We should
probably get Ken first.

00:45:56.289 --> 00:45:57.423
Ken?

00:45:57.456 --> 00:45:58.491
Ken.

00:45:58.524 --> 00:45:59.860
You know, Ken. Barbie and Ken.

00:45:59.893 --> 00:46:01.427
Oh!

00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:03.696
-Yes, Ken. Yeah.
-Ken. The guy. Yeah.

00:46:05.631 --> 00:46:08.802
Back to Barbie Land!

00:46:08.835 --> 00:46:11.370
- I'm gonna be sick.
- I'm gonna be sick.

00:46:11.404 --> 00:46:14.173
Ken isn't something
we're worried about.

00:46:15.241 --> 00:46:16.642
Ever.

00:46:16.676 --> 00:46:18.744
Okay, I'll just, um...
I'll get in the box then.

00:46:18.778 --> 00:46:20.112
All right! Yes!

00:46:21.447 --> 00:46:23.749
Oh. But since I came
all this way,

00:46:23.783 --> 00:46:25.751
could I just meet
the woman in charge,

00:46:25.785 --> 00:46:27.753
your CEO?

00:46:27.787 --> 00:46:29.388
Oh, that would be me.

00:46:29.422 --> 00:46:30.690
-Oh. Your CFO.
-Me.

00:46:30.723 --> 00:46:32.224
-Your COO.
-Here.

00:46:32.258 --> 00:46:33.392
President
of the Barbie division.

00:46:33.426 --> 00:46:34.660
-Present.
-I'm a man with no power.

00:46:34.694 --> 00:46:36.796
Does that make me a woman?

00:46:36.830 --> 00:46:39.265
Are any women in charge?

00:46:39.298 --> 00:46:42.735
Listen, I know exactly
where you're going with this,

00:46:42.768 --> 00:46:45.438
and I have to say
I really resent it.

00:46:45.471 --> 00:46:48.307
We are a company
literally made of women.

00:46:48.341 --> 00:46:50.743
We had a woman CEO in the '90s.

00:46:50.776 --> 00:46:52.678
And there was another one...

00:46:53.746 --> 00:46:56.415
at some other time.

00:46:58.217 --> 00:47:00.653
So that's--
that's two right there.

00:47:00.686 --> 00:47:04.825
Women are the freaking
foundation of this very long

00:47:04.858 --> 00:47:06.592
phallic building.

00:47:06.626 --> 00:47:09.462
We have
gender-neutral bathrooms
up the wazoo.

00:47:09.495 --> 00:47:12.398
Every single one of these men
love women.

00:47:12.431 --> 00:47:14.300
I'm the son of a mother.

00:47:14.333 --> 00:47:16.636
I'm the mother of a son.

00:47:16.669 --> 00:47:20.406
I'm... I'm the nephew
of a woman aunt.

00:47:20.439 --> 00:47:22.208
Some of my best friends
are Jewish.

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:25.444
What I'm trying to say is...

00:47:26.479 --> 00:47:28.347
Get in the box, you Jezebel!

00:47:29.448 --> 00:47:30.917
What? I can't say Jezebel now?

00:47:30.951 --> 00:47:33.719
I haven't been
in a box in ages.

00:47:33.753 --> 00:47:35.287
See? It's easy.

00:47:36.722 --> 00:47:38.257
Oh, okay.

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.792
Huh.

00:47:39.826 --> 00:47:42.461
Oh, my gosh.
I remember this smell.

00:47:42.495 --> 00:47:44.597
I'm having a real
Proustian flashback.

00:47:44.630 --> 00:47:48.401
Remember Proust Barbie?
That did not sell very well.

00:47:54.740 --> 00:47:56.308
Oh! Ha-ha!

00:47:56.342 --> 00:47:58.544
You know what?
Um, before I get in the box,

00:47:58.577 --> 00:47:59.813
could I just run
to the restroom

00:47:59.846 --> 00:48:01.580
and make sure
my hair is perfect?

00:48:01.614 --> 00:48:03.950
-Fine. Can you
be speedy about it?
-Mmm-hmm.

00:48:05.618 --> 00:48:06.953
-Down this way?
-It's just down the hallway.

00:48:06.987 --> 00:48:08.654
- Thank you.
- On the right.

00:48:13.726 --> 00:48:14.961
I guess she really
had to go to the bathroom.

I always find
I think best at kitchen tables.

Uh, yes, please.

00:50:29.795 --> 00:50:33.465
No. You look different.

00:50:33.499 --> 00:50:37.070
Oh. It's not
how I normally look.
I usually look perfect.

00:50:38.171 --> 00:50:40.106
Oh, I don't know.

00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.441
I think you're just right.

00:50:49.983 --> 00:50:52.052
Real World isn't
what I thought it was.

It never is.

00:50:54.787 --> 00:50:56.622

00:50:58.424 --> 00:51:01.427
Who are you?

00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.529

Who saw her last?

00:51:03.562 --> 00:51:05.664
Uh, if you go
through that closet,

00:51:05.698 --> 00:51:07.733
you'll find a stairwell
down to the lobby.

00:51:07.766 --> 00:51:09.702

00:52:06.259 --> 00:52:07.660
Oh, we didn't need it!

00:52:07.693 --> 00:52:09.561
Barbie!

00:52:09.595 --> 00:52:11.898
Let's form a plan here.

00:52:11.932 --> 00:52:15.201
I would normally have shotgun.
I'll go in the first one.

00:52:15.235 --> 00:52:16.502
<i>Hang on.</i>

00:52:18.704 --> 00:52:19.940
Ahh!

00:52:19.973 --> 00:52:21.207
God, I hope
nobody from school saw us

00:52:21.241 --> 00:52:23.475
put a life-size Barbie
in our car.

00:52:23.509 --> 00:52:24.743
- How did this even happen?
-  -I don't know.

00:52:24.777 --> 00:52:26.578
How are you here?
You're like an idea.

00:52:26.612 --> 00:52:27.914
A great idea.

00:52:27.948 --> 00:52:30.516
So, I've been
a little lonely lately.

00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:32.551
And I found those Barbies
we used to play with--

00:52:32.584 --> 00:52:34.220
-I thought we gave those away.
-Well, I started playing
with them.

00:52:34.254 --> 00:52:36.722
And making drawings
like we used to do.
Remember?

00:52:36.755 --> 00:52:38.091
Because I thought
it would be joyful.

00:52:38.124 --> 00:52:39.625
-Was it?
-No, it wasn't.

00:52:39.658 --> 00:52:41.027
I got sad and weird,

00:52:41.061 --> 00:52:42.963
and then the drawings
got sad and weird,

00:52:42.996 --> 00:52:45.497
and maybe
because I couldn't be like you,

00:52:45.531 --> 00:52:46.900
I ended up making you like me.

00:52:48.734 --> 00:52:50.270
Did any of these drawings
by chance

00:52:50.303 --> 00:52:53.039
have thoughts
of death and cellulite?

00:52:53.073 --> 00:52:56.009
Yes! Irrepressible
Thoughts of Death Barbie.

00:52:56.042 --> 00:52:58.544
-Oh, my God!
-And Cellulite!

00:53:01.915 --> 00:53:04.650
-I came for you!
-You came for me!

00:53:04.683 --> 00:53:06.552
Those were <i>your</i> memories.

00:53:32.578 --> 00:53:36.149
Hello? Hello? Hello?

00:53:36.182 --> 00:53:39.019
Hello? Are you two,
like, shining?

00:53:39.052 --> 00:53:40.820
No! No, it's nothing like that.

00:53:40.854 --> 00:53:43.823
-Are you shining
with a real Barbie?
-No!

00:53:43.857 --> 00:53:45.724
I mean, maybe.
Like a little, yes.

00:53:45.758 --> 00:53:47.327
I don't even know
where to start

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.262
with this
wishing-a-Barbie-to-life crap.

00:53:49.295 --> 00:53:51.563
Oh, Sasha, listen.

00:53:51.597 --> 00:53:53.867
I'm just a boring mom
with a boring job
and a daughter who hates me.

00:53:53.900 --> 00:53:56.069
Can you blame me for wanting
to have a little fun?

00:53:57.370 --> 00:53:58.805
I gotta lose
these chuckleheads.

00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:01.607
Ahh!

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:02.641
Mom!

00:54:04.878 --> 00:54:06.645
I think I owe you ladies
an apology.

00:54:06.678 --> 00:54:09.215
I thought that Barbie
had made the Real World better,

00:54:09.249 --> 00:54:12.052
but the Real World is forever
and irrevocably messed up!

00:54:12.085 --> 00:54:15.055
Well, the Real World
is not perfect,
but you inspired me.

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:19.625
I love women.
I want to help women.

00:54:19.658 --> 00:54:21.094
Oh, come off it,
everybody hates women.

00:54:21.127 --> 00:54:22.628
Women hate women,
and men hate women.

00:54:22.661 --> 00:54:23.863
It's the one thing
we can all agree on.

00:54:23.897 --> 00:54:25.331
-Is that true?
-It's complicated.

00:54:25.365 --> 00:54:27.033
-Hate is a strong word.
-Wake up, Mom!

00:54:28.767 --> 00:54:30.736
- I am wide awake,
Sasha!

00:54:34.307 --> 00:54:37.043
Mom, where did you learn
to drive like this?

00:54:37.077 --> 00:54:39.611
-There was this guy.
-Was it Dad?

00:54:39.645 --> 00:54:41.613
Yeah, yeah, it was...
It was Dad.

00:55:00.900 --> 00:55:02.969
Okay, duck.

00:55:03.002 --> 00:55:04.370
You look so pretty.
- Don't look at me.

00:55:04.404 --> 00:55:05.604
Okay, sorry.

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:12.778
I can't hold them off forever.
Where can we go?

00:55:12.812 --> 00:55:16.282
Wait, I have an idea.
Can you get us to Venice Beach?

00:55:16.316 --> 00:55:17.851
Sure can.

00:55:17.884 --> 00:55:20.420
Ah! I love Rollerblades.
Where are we going?

00:55:20.453 --> 00:55:22.288
- Barbie Land.
- What? Mom!

00:55:22.322 --> 00:55:24.157
Are you really gonna let Barbie

00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:26.792
take you
and your tween daughter
to an imaginary land?

00:55:26.826 --> 00:55:29.028
Yes, and you wanna know why?
Because I never
get to do anything.

00:55:29.062 --> 00:55:31.297
I didn't even go on that cruise
I won at your school raffle

00:55:31.331 --> 00:55:33.333
because I didn't have
enough vacation days
and your dad's allergic to sun.

00:55:33.366 --> 00:55:35.734
-Oh.
-What about Dad?
We can't just leave him!

00:55:35.767 --> 00:55:37.203
He'll be fine.

00:55:37.237 --> 00:55:38.438
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

00:55:38.471 --> 00:55:39.806
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

00:55:39.839 --> 00:55:41.007
<i>Bolígrafos.</i>

00:55:43.076 --> 00:55:44.077
Yeah, yeah. He'll be fine.

00:55:44.110 --> 00:55:45.378
Ready for fun?

00:55:45.411 --> 00:55:46.778
-Yes!
-Great!

00:55:46.813 --> 00:55:49.149
Here we go!

00:55:49.182 --> 00:55:50.917
Come on and feel the magic.

00:55:50.950 --> 00:55:53.019
Where are we?

00:55:53.052 --> 00:55:54.354
How did we get
into these clothes?

00:55:54.387 --> 00:55:55.922
How did we get
into this vehicle?

00:55:55.955 --> 00:55:57.689
When I was a kid,
I lost these boots

00:55:57.723 --> 00:55:59.725
and my mom wouldn't let me
buy a whole new Barbie

00:55:59.758 --> 00:56:01.060
just to replace the boots.

00:56:01.094 --> 00:56:02.862
-They look so good on you.
-Why, thank you.

00:56:02.896 --> 00:56:04.964
-Hey, you!
-She was always
my favorite Barbie.

00:56:04.998 --> 00:56:06.299
You're my favorite human.

00:56:06.332 --> 00:56:09.068
Don't tell him,
but I never got a Ken.

00:56:09.102 --> 00:56:11.104
That's because Ken
is totally superfluous.

00:56:11.137 --> 00:56:13.173
I didn't say that.

00:56:13.206 --> 00:56:16.176
Women hold
all major positions of power,
control all the money.

00:56:16.209 --> 00:56:17.977
Basically, everything
that men do in your world,

00:56:18.011 --> 00:56:19.179
women do in ours.

00:56:19.212 --> 00:56:20.480
I mean,
that sounds kind of cool.

00:56:20.513 --> 00:56:23.116

and it's fun and work
and friendship and female 24/7.

00:56:36.362 --> 00:56:38.364

00:56:38.398 --> 00:56:40.066
No, that's crazy.

Actually, yeah,

00:56:44.137 --> 00:56:45.338
there was a blonde,
a brunette and a tween.

00:56:45.371 --> 00:56:46.372
They Rollerbladed
in that direction.

00:56:46.406 --> 00:56:48.141
Oh, no.

00:56:48.174 --> 00:56:50.310
First step
is always Rollerblading.

00:56:50.343 --> 00:56:51.411
Excuse me, sir?

00:56:51.444 --> 00:56:53.779
They've gone to Barbie Land.

00:56:53.813 --> 00:56:55.481
-Oh, no.
-And she's brought humans
there with her.

00:56:55.515 --> 00:56:57.483
This could mean extremely
weird things for our world.

00:56:57.517 --> 00:56:59.085
Like what?

00:56:59.118 --> 00:57:00.786
Nothing any of our collective
imaginations

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:01.955
could ever dream up.

00:57:01.988 --> 00:57:05.325
A podcast
hosted by two wise trees.

00:57:05.358 --> 00:57:08.861
Or a choir
of 2,000 young fathers.

00:57:08.895 --> 00:57:11.531
Not even close.
We've got to
get to Barbie Land.

00:57:11.564 --> 00:57:16.002
Go! Find some blades now!
Just pick a direction and run!

00:57:16.035 --> 00:57:19.839
I can practically feel
my heels lifting already. Yes!

00:57:19.872 --> 00:57:22.542
This is what I was supposed
to do. Bring you back here.

00:57:22.575 --> 00:57:24.776
-It feels right.
-It does.

00:57:24.811 --> 00:57:26.446
Okay, this is...

00:57:26.479 --> 00:57:28.915
Oh. That's strange.

00:57:32.318 --> 00:57:35.822
♪ <i>'Cause that's the man I am♪</i>

00:57:35.855 --> 00:57:37.991
♪ <i>Baby, treat me right♪</i>

00:57:38.024 --> 00:57:41.394
Incoming brewski beer.

00:57:41.427 --> 00:57:43.429
So, that's our president,
with the beer.

00:57:43.463 --> 00:57:46.366
And the cheering squad
is the Supreme Court.

00:57:46.399 --> 00:57:49.469
This is so much better
than being president.

00:57:49.502 --> 00:57:51.904
Something's weird today.

00:57:51.938 --> 00:57:53.339
Hi, Barbie!

00:57:54.274 --> 00:57:56.276
Oh, okay. Hi, Ken.

00:57:56.309 --> 00:58:00.913
-Have a brewski beer.
My big guy is thirsty.
-Ah.

00:58:01.981 --> 00:58:04.017
Anyway, uh...

00:58:04.050 --> 00:58:05.585
Wait until you see
my Dreamhouse.

00:58:05.618 --> 00:58:08.187
Everything I've bought and own
will totally inspire you.

00:58:08.221 --> 00:58:09.788
And we can
change clothes again!

00:58:12.925 --> 00:58:14.494
- That's the Capitol.
- Ah!

00:58:14.527 --> 00:58:16.229
-It's pink?
-Pink!

00:58:16.262 --> 00:58:17.463
And that's the--

♪ <i>You think</i>
<i>That women rule the world♪</i>

00:58:21.634 --> 00:58:24.537
These are the Dreamhouses.
This is where I live.

00:58:24.570 --> 00:58:26.606
You can see
through the houses.

00:58:26.639 --> 00:58:28.941
So does each Barbie, like,
have their own house?

00:58:28.975 --> 00:58:30.576
-Mmm-hmm.
-That's cool.

00:58:30.610 --> 00:58:32.178
Where do the Kens stay?

00:58:33.079 --> 00:58:34.847
I don't know.

00:58:34.881 --> 00:58:37.350
At first I thought
the Real World was run by men.

00:58:37.383 --> 00:58:38.885
And then there was a minute

00:58:38.918 --> 00:58:41.487
where I thought
it was run by horses.

00:58:41.521 --> 00:58:44.524
But then I realized that horses
are just men extenders.

00:58:44.557 --> 00:58:47.060
- Oh!
- Hmm?

00:58:47.093 --> 00:58:49.028
Oh. I had that treehouse.

00:58:49.062 --> 00:58:51.130
I saved up my allowance
to buy it.

00:58:51.164 --> 00:58:55.635
I've never seen a car like that before.
What happened here?

00:58:55.668 --> 00:58:58.404
Everything,
basically everything exists

00:58:58.438 --> 00:59:01.274
to expand and elevate
the presence of men.

00:59:01.307 --> 00:59:03.209
-That's amazing.
-That's beautiful.

00:59:03.242 --> 00:59:04.510
- I know.
- Barbie's here.

00:59:04.544 --> 00:59:05.645
Uh-oh.

00:59:05.678 --> 00:59:08.915
Ken?

00:59:08.948 --> 00:59:10.917
What have you done?

00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:13.453
What are you wearing?

00:59:13.486 --> 00:59:16.422
Don't question it.
Just roll with it, tiny baby.

00:59:16.456 --> 00:59:18.391
- Tiny baby.
- Don't call me baby.

00:59:18.424 --> 00:59:20.393
What about mini-baby?
Like this mini-fridge.

00:59:21.361 --> 00:59:23.129
No, Ken.

00:59:23.162 --> 00:59:26.432
This is my Dreamhouse.
It is my Dreamhouse! It's mine!

00:59:26.466 --> 00:59:28.501
No, this is no longer
Barbie's Dreamhouse.

00:59:28.534 --> 00:59:34.173
This shall henceforth be known
as Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa House.

00:59:34.207 --> 00:59:36.175
You don't have to say dojo
and house.

00:59:36.209 --> 00:59:37.543
And casa...

00:59:37.577 --> 00:59:39.579
But you do
because it feels good. Try it.

00:59:39.612 --> 00:59:41.981
- Mojo Dojo Casa--
- No, girls. Don't say it.

00:59:42.014 --> 00:59:44.050
Mojo Dojo Casa House.

00:59:45.985 --> 00:59:47.353
Give it to me straight.
How weird is it?

00:59:47.387 --> 00:59:50.356
Whoa, boss,
these Mojo Dojo Casa Houses

00:59:50.390 --> 00:59:52.592
are literally flying
off the shelves.

00:59:52.625 --> 00:59:56.963
The kids are clamoring
for them.
Ken is on T-shirts, mugs.

00:59:56.996 --> 00:59:59.098
- It's the number one tattoo.
- Oh, no.

00:59:59.132 --> 01:00:02.068
Warner Bros. have started
auditions for the Ken movie,

01:00:02.101 --> 01:00:06.005
which is already
a blockbuster hit.

01:00:06.038 --> 01:00:07.673
It's happening. That thing
we could never imagine.

01:00:07.707 --> 01:00:09.275
If we don't get
my words lady...

01:00:09.308 --> 01:00:11.244
-Executive Assistant.
-My Executive Words Lady

01:00:11.277 --> 01:00:12.545
and someone
who's probably her daughter

01:00:12.578 --> 01:00:14.080
back here and close the portal,

01:00:14.113 --> 01:00:15.515
our worlds could be altered
forever.

01:00:15.548 --> 01:00:17.417
Well, what does it matter
if it's Barbie or Ken?

01:00:17.450 --> 01:00:18.718
The money is pouring in.

01:00:18.751 --> 01:00:21.120
Shame on you,
Executive Number Two.

01:00:21.154 --> 01:00:23.222
You think I spent
my entire life in boardrooms

01:00:23.256 --> 01:00:24.357
because of a bottom line?

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:25.958
No! I got into this business

01:00:25.992 --> 01:00:28.194
because of little girls
and their dreams.

01:00:28.227 --> 01:00:30.430
In the least creepy way
possible.

01:00:30.463 --> 01:00:33.433
Now, blade faster.
Time is running out.

01:00:33.466 --> 01:00:36.102
Look, I'm just having
some brewski beers

01:00:36.135 --> 01:00:38.371
at my Mojo Dojo Casa House.

01:00:38.404 --> 01:00:40.072
Ken!

01:00:40.106 --> 01:00:41.607
You can stay if you want,

01:00:41.641 --> 01:00:43.376
as my bride wife,

01:00:43.409 --> 01:00:46.078
or my long-term-low-
commitment-distance girlfriend.

01:00:46.112 --> 01:00:47.547
-What do you say?
-Ugh.

01:00:48.414 --> 01:00:49.649
Brewski beer me?

01:00:49.682 --> 01:00:52.518
I will not brewski beer you.

01:00:52.552 --> 01:00:55.154
Ha-ha-ha. That's fine.

01:00:55.188 --> 01:00:57.023
You know, now that
you Barbies aren't around
to run everything,

01:00:57.056 --> 01:00:58.458
we can do our hair
however we like.

01:00:58.491 --> 01:00:59.759
I have hats.

01:00:59.792 --> 01:01:03.229
Where are my hungry boys?
Who wants snacks?

01:01:03.262 --> 01:01:05.231
Barbie,
I am so happy to see you.

01:01:05.264 --> 01:01:06.432
Can you believe
what is happening?

01:01:06.466 --> 01:01:08.134
I know. Isn't it great?

01:01:08.167 --> 01:01:10.603
Anyone need a brewski beer?

01:01:10.636 --> 01:01:13.339
What are you doing?
You're a doctor.

01:01:13.372 --> 01:01:15.241
I like being
a helpful decoration.

01:01:15.274 --> 01:01:18.144
And Allan likes to help me give
all the Kens foot massages.

01:01:18.177 --> 01:01:19.378
No, I don't, I don't like that.

01:01:19.412 --> 01:01:21.347
We love it.

01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:22.615
-Ugh, so gross.
-I'm so blotto-faced
day-drunk right now.

01:01:23.649 --> 01:01:25.585
Ditto same-same that.

01:01:25.618 --> 01:01:27.186
I like not having to make
any decisions.

01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:29.522
It's like a spa day
for my brain. Forever.

01:01:29.555 --> 01:01:31.390
What is wrong with them?

01:01:31.424 --> 01:01:32.758
We just explained to them
the immaculate,

01:01:32.792 --> 01:01:34.427
impeccable seamless
garment of logic

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.062
that is patriarchy,
and they crumbled.

01:01:36.095 --> 01:01:38.264
Oh, my God.
This is like in the 1500s

01:01:38.297 --> 01:01:40.099
with the indigenous people
and smallpox.

01:01:40.132 --> 01:01:41.534
They had no defenses
against it.

01:01:41.567 --> 01:01:44.737
Yeah. Buckle up, babe.

01:01:44.770 --> 01:01:48.207
Because Barbie Land
is now Ken Land.

01:01:48.241 --> 01:01:50.710
And it's gonna be just like
Century City in Los Angeles,

01:01:50.743 --> 01:01:54.113
because they had it all
figured out in Century City.

01:01:54.146 --> 01:01:56.449
The minute you get
out of your car, you're like,

01:01:56.482 --> 01:01:59.151
"I can't believe
how great this place is!"

01:01:59.185 --> 01:02:01.554
No, no, no. They don't have it
figured out in Century City

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:03.656
because we failed them.

01:02:03.689 --> 01:02:06.058
No! You failed me!

01:02:11.832 --> 01:02:14.400
Out there, I was somebody.

01:02:16.335 --> 01:02:18.170
And when I walked
down the street...

01:02:20.306 --> 01:02:23.109
people respected me
just for who I am.

01:02:25.879 --> 01:02:30.082
One lady, she even
asked me for the time.

01:02:30.116 --> 01:02:30.851
No way!

01:02:30.884 --> 01:02:32.451
Way.

01:02:35.221 --> 01:02:36.656
And if it weren't
for these technicalities

01:02:36.689 --> 01:02:39.225
like MBAs, medical degrees,

01:02:39.258 --> 01:02:44.297
and I don't know,
swim lessons, I could
have ruled that world.

01:02:44.330 --> 01:02:45.798
But I don't need
any of those things here.

01:02:51.838 --> 01:02:55.408
Here, I'm just a dude.
And you know what?

01:02:59.712 --> 01:03:00.746
That's enough.

01:03:00.780 --> 01:03:02.181
TV remote.

01:03:06.552 --> 01:03:07.753
Which one is it?

01:03:07.787 --> 01:03:09.622
Oh, it's that one right there.

01:03:11.724 --> 01:03:13.259

01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:45.826
This is Barbie Land.

01:03:45.859 --> 01:03:47.861
The Barbies worked hard
and they dreamed hard

01:03:47.894 --> 01:03:50.763
to make it
everything that it is. You--

01:03:50.796 --> 01:03:54.233
You can't just
undo it in a day.

01:03:54.266 --> 01:03:56.469
Literally and figuratively,
watch me.

01:03:57.536 --> 01:04:01.707
Now, if you'll excuse me...

01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:05.846
this is my Mojo Dojo
Casa House, it's not

01:04:05.879 --> 01:04:08.849
Barbie's Mojo Dojo
Casa House.

01:04:10.483 --> 01:04:11.484
Right?

01:04:15.822 --> 01:04:17.256
How's that feel?

01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:22.863
It is not fun, is it?

01:04:24.831 --> 01:04:27.333
It's boys' night!

01:04:42.615 --> 01:04:44.383
Every night is boys' night.

01:04:48.654 --> 01:04:51.557
Go, Ken! Go, Ken! Go, Ken!

01:04:56.997 --> 01:05:01.001
Barbie! Take your
lady fashions with you.

01:05:01.034 --> 01:05:04.537
Take your Celebrate Disco
Bell Bottoms...

01:05:04.570 --> 01:05:06.272
Oh!

01:05:06.305 --> 01:05:08.708
...and your Ice Capades
Pretty Practice Suit

01:05:08.741 --> 01:05:10.443
and Dazzling Show Skirt.

01:05:10.476 --> 01:05:12.344
These are archival.

01:05:12.378 --> 01:05:14.948
Your Pajama Jam
in Amsterdam sets.

01:05:14.981 --> 01:05:16.482
No!

01:05:16.515 --> 01:05:18.718
And your Pretty Paisley
Palazzo Pants!

01:05:20.053 --> 01:05:22.989
-Not the Palazzos!
-And get out!

01:05:25.959 --> 01:05:27.727
Maybe this could fit me.

01:05:30.897 --> 01:05:32.498
Honey.

01:05:32.531 --> 01:05:34.600
Why did you wish me
to your messed-up world

01:05:34.633 --> 01:05:38.671
using your complicated
human thoughts and feelings?

01:05:38.704 --> 01:05:41.741
-What?
-Barbie Land
was perfect before.

01:05:42.843 --> 01:05:45.611
I was perfect before.

01:05:45.644 --> 01:05:49.315
I'm so sorry.
I wasn't trying to do anything.

01:05:49.348 --> 01:05:50.516
Don't apologize.

01:05:51.383 --> 01:05:52.853
Don't blame my mom.

01:05:52.886 --> 01:05:54.653
Aw, Sasha,
that's sweet.

01:05:54.687 --> 01:05:57.723
Maybe you wished us.
Maybe it's your fault, Barbie.

01:05:57.757 --> 01:05:58.992
No,
I didn't wish anything.

01:05:59.025 --> 01:06:02.361
I've never wanted
anything to change.

01:06:02.394 --> 01:06:07.600
Oh, honey, that's life.
It's all change.

01:06:08.601 --> 01:06:09.936
That's...

01:06:09.970 --> 01:06:11.670
That's terrifying.

01:06:15.976 --> 01:06:16.910
I don't want that.

01:06:18.444 --> 01:06:21.014
Not my life. No, thank you.

01:06:21.047 --> 01:06:24.483
Just, no, I don't want this.

01:06:30.924 --> 01:06:33.526
I'm just gonna sit here
and wait and hope

01:06:33.559 --> 01:06:36.362
that one of the more
leadership-oriented Barbies

01:06:36.395 --> 01:06:38.364
just snaps out of it

01:06:38.397 --> 01:06:40.366
and does something
about this whole mess.

01:06:40.399 --> 01:06:42.903
I really understand
this feeling.

01:06:42.936 --> 01:06:46.006
It's basically, like, being
a human person all the time--

01:06:46.039 --> 01:06:48.340
Please just leave me here.
Just leave me.

01:06:48.374 --> 01:06:52.112
Go back to your messed-up world
and just leave me to mine.

01:06:52.145 --> 01:06:54.513
- So, you're just gonna give up?
- Yes.

01:06:59.385 --> 01:07:00.786
Okay.

01:07:00.821 --> 01:07:02.454
You know,
I almost feel bad for you,

01:07:02.488 --> 01:07:04.925
but you are exactly
what I thought you were.

01:07:06.059 --> 01:07:07.093
Um...

01:07:08.128 --> 01:07:10.096
Let's go, honey. Let's just...

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:11.530
Okay, how do we--
how do you expect--

01:07:11.564 --> 01:07:12.933
Do everything we did
in reverse.

01:07:15.168 --> 01:07:18.839
Unbelievable. Come on, Mom.
She doesn't deserve you.

01:07:23.910 --> 01:07:26.779
This is the lowest
I've ever been.

01:07:26.813 --> 01:07:29.582
Emotionally and physically.

01:07:31.151 --> 01:07:32.152
<i>Okay, kids,</i>

01:07:32.185 --> 01:07:33.686

01:07:37.123 --> 01:07:39.491

<i>Anxiety, panic attacks,</i>

01:08:00.013 --> 01:08:03.049
Barbie.
Barbie, wake up.

01:08:03.083 --> 01:08:04.084
- Hey.
<i>- Weird.</i>

01:08:05.551 --> 01:08:07.053
I'm like you now.

01:08:07.087 --> 01:08:09.055
Ugly and unwanted.

01:08:09.923 --> 01:08:10.957
Thanks.

01:08:12.158 --> 01:08:13.626
Let's get her in the back.
Come on.

01:08:13.659 --> 01:08:14.660
One, two...

01:08:15.996 --> 01:08:16.997
- Isn't this great?
- Yes.

01:08:17.030 --> 01:08:18.697
Wait until you see the boat.

01:08:18.731 --> 01:08:19.966
The boat.

01:08:21.567 --> 01:08:23.136
Beautiful
countryside.

-Who are you?
-I'm Allan.

01:09:05.011 --> 01:09:06.846
Oh, you are Allan.
That's great.

01:09:06.880 --> 01:09:08.747
Don't tell the Kens.
I'm trying to escape.

01:09:08.781 --> 01:09:10.582
I cannot sit
on one more leather couch.

01:09:10.616 --> 01:09:12.252
It's gonna break my spirit.

01:09:12.285 --> 01:09:14.220
As soon as they figure out
how to build that wall sideways

01:09:14.254 --> 01:09:15.855
and not just up,

01:09:15.889 --> 01:09:18.158
no one is gonna be able
to get in or out.

01:09:18.191 --> 01:09:20.026
So if we want to leave,
we better make a run for it.

01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.695
No, Allan. You can't go.
Having a Barbie
in the Real World

01:09:22.728 --> 01:09:24.496
is what caused all these
problems in the first place.

01:09:24.530 --> 01:09:26.598
Not one person would care
if Allan was in the Real World.

01:09:26.632 --> 01:09:30.136
In fact, it's happened before.
All of *NSYNC, Allan.

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:32.038
Yes, even him, so come on!

01:09:32.072 --> 01:09:33.073
Hey, you there.

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:35.674
What do we do?

01:09:35.708 --> 01:09:36.642
Just get in the car
and keep it singing.

01:09:36.675 --> 01:09:37.776
-Hey, man.
-What?

01:09:37.811 --> 01:09:39.511
Be ready for anything.

01:09:39.545 --> 01:09:40.746
Who are you?

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:42.949
I'm Allan. I'm, uh,
I'm Ken's buddy.

01:09:42.983 --> 01:09:44.650
Yeah, all of his clothes
fit me.

01:09:46.820 --> 01:09:48.822
Get in the car!

01:09:52.624 --> 01:09:53.960
You want a piece?

01:09:53.994 --> 01:09:55.195
Wait, you don't have
a driver's license.

01:09:55.228 --> 01:09:56.262
This car doesn't have
an engine.

01:09:56.296 --> 01:09:57.163
Fine.

01:10:01.567 --> 01:10:02.936
What are you doing?
We gotta go.

01:10:02.969 --> 01:10:05.571
We have to go back.
Barbie Land needs saving.

01:10:05.604 --> 01:10:07.073
Barbie needs saving.

01:10:07.107 --> 01:10:08.942
What? You hate Barbie!

01:10:08.975 --> 01:10:10.944
But you don't. You've always
believed in what she could be.

01:10:10.977 --> 01:10:14.247
Yeah, well, I was wrong.
Barbie gave up. The Kens won.

01:10:15.181 --> 01:10:16.715
You have to try.

01:10:16.749 --> 01:10:18.251
Even if--
Even if you can't
make it perfect,

01:10:18.284 --> 01:10:20.719
-you can make it better.
-I can't make anything better.

01:10:20.753 --> 01:10:22.155
I'm the one
who ruined Barbie Land

01:10:22.188 --> 01:10:23.589
with my stupid drawings
in the first place.

01:10:23.622 --> 01:10:25.191
They're not stupid!
They're amazing!

01:10:27.827 --> 01:10:29.561
You like my drawings?

01:10:29.595 --> 01:10:32.798
They're weird
and dark and crazy.

01:10:32.832 --> 01:10:34.733
Everything
you pretend not to be.

01:10:36.702 --> 01:10:40.073
I am, I am. I'm weird
and I'm dark and I'm crazy.

01:10:42.775 --> 01:10:45.078
Easy. Easy.

01:10:47.313 --> 01:10:49.916
Okay. You want some more Allan?

01:10:52.152 --> 01:10:53.585
We have to get out of here
right now.

01:10:53.619 --> 01:10:56.122
Shut up, Allan!
We're going back.

01:10:56.156 --> 01:10:57.957
Let's go get my doll.

01:11:01.828 --> 01:11:03.930
I'll never get out of here.

01:11:03.963 --> 01:11:05.298
Where do
we find Barbie?

01:11:05.331 --> 01:11:06.632
There's only
one place she'd be.

01:11:08.935 --> 01:11:10.070
You're a writer.

01:11:10.103 --> 01:11:11.971
This is your Nobel Prize.

01:11:12.005 --> 01:11:13.206
-Remember winning it?
-Huh.

01:11:13.239 --> 01:11:14.841
It's useless
trying to deprogram her.

01:11:14.874 --> 01:11:16.376
I already did
everything I could.

01:11:16.409 --> 01:11:19.379
Oh, my God.
I don't even know
how I got here.

01:11:19.412 --> 01:11:21.047
I don't deserve this.

01:11:21.081 --> 01:11:23.817
Um, I'd like to thank Ken.

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:26.685
Thank you, Ken.

01:11:26.718 --> 01:11:28.654
I love you, Ken.

01:11:28.687 --> 01:11:30.123
The fork in my soup is this,
Barb.

01:11:30.156 --> 01:11:33.093
Why didn't the brainwashing
work on you?

01:11:33.126 --> 01:11:36.196
My exposure
to the Real World must
have made me immune.

01:11:36.229 --> 01:11:38.998
Either you're brainwashed,
or you're weird and ugly.

01:11:39.032 --> 01:11:40.200
There is no in between.

01:11:40.233 --> 01:11:41.667
Sing it, sister.

01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:43.203
Well, get ready, kids.

01:11:43.236 --> 01:11:45.071
Because in 48 hours,
Barbie Land becomes Ken Land.

01:11:45.105 --> 01:11:46.672
Come on, gang.

01:11:46.705 --> 01:11:47.941
We'll find Barbie
at the top of these stairs.

01:11:47.974 --> 01:11:49.741
The Kens. They've found us.

01:11:53.379 --> 01:11:54.948
- Ken!
- No! Get back.

01:11:54.981 --> 01:11:56.116
Ken. Oh. Oh!

01:11:59.385 --> 01:12:01.387
- Hello?
- Hmm?

01:12:01.421 --> 01:12:03.689
- Humans. We're fine.
- Ah.

01:12:03.722 --> 01:12:05.757
- And Allan.
- Hmm.

01:12:05.791 --> 01:12:08.394
Come into my Weirdhouse.
Hi! I'm Weird Barbie.

01:12:08.428 --> 01:12:10.196
I'm in the splits,
I have a funky haircut,

01:12:10.230 --> 01:12:11.663
and I smell like basement.

01:12:11.697 --> 01:12:14.167
Oh, my God.
I had a Weird Barbie.

01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:17.303
-Yeah, you did.
-You make them weird
by playing too hard.

01:12:17.337 --> 01:12:19.105
That's cool.

01:12:19.139 --> 01:12:21.040
That's Sugar Daddy Ken.
And Earring Magic Ken.

01:12:21.074 --> 01:12:22.674
Mattel discontinued them.

01:12:22.708 --> 01:12:23.877
-Sugar Daddy?
-No, no, no.

01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:25.145
I'm not a sugar daddy.

01:12:25.178 --> 01:12:27.779
This is Sugar,
and I'm her daddy.

01:12:27.814 --> 01:12:30.083
And I have an earring.
A magic earring.

01:12:30.116 --> 01:12:31.951
These were actual Kens.

01:12:31.985 --> 01:12:34.420
More
discontinued Barbies.

01:12:34.454 --> 01:12:37.056
Growing Up Skipper? May I?

01:12:37.090 --> 01:12:38.224
- Okay.
- Watch this.

01:12:39.725 --> 01:12:42.028
-Her boobs grow.
-Why would they do that?

01:12:42.061 --> 01:12:43.997
And Barbie Video Girl.

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:47.133
I have a TV in my back.
You know whose dream that is?

01:12:47.167 --> 01:12:49.402
Nobody. Nobody's dream.

01:12:49.435 --> 01:12:51.337
And that's Barbie Barbie,
of course.

01:12:51.371 --> 01:12:53.705
She's not dead. She's just
having an existential crisis.

01:12:53.739 --> 01:12:55.141
Okay, come on.

01:12:56.476 --> 01:12:57.676
Hey.

01:12:58.478 --> 01:12:59.379
What's wrong?

01:13:03.483 --> 01:13:07.220
I'm not
pretty anymore.

01:13:08.988 --> 01:13:10.823
What? You're so pretty.

01:13:10.857 --> 01:13:14.360
I'm not
Stereotypical Barbie pretty.

01:13:14.394 --> 01:13:16.062
<i>Note to the filmmakers.</i>

01:13:16.095 --> 01:13:17.263
<i>Margot Robbie is</i>
<i>the wrong person to cast</i>

01:13:17.297 --> 01:13:18.364
<i>if you want to make this point.</i>

01:13:18.398 --> 01:13:20.867
But you're beautiful.

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:22.435
It's not just that. I'm not...

01:13:24.337 --> 01:13:26.105
smart enough to be interesting.

01:13:26.139 --> 01:13:28.308
You're so smart.

01:13:28.341 --> 01:13:30.343
- I can't do brain surgery,
I've never flown a plane.

01:13:31.945 --> 01:13:33.179
I'm not the president.

01:13:34.948 --> 01:13:36.983
No one on the Supreme Court
is me.

01:13:39.052 --> 01:13:43.755
I'm not good enough
for anything.

01:13:50.230 --> 01:13:53.166
It is literally impossible
to be a woman.

01:13:54.968 --> 01:13:58.404
You are so beautiful
and so smart,

01:13:58.438 --> 01:14:02.041
and it kills me that you don't
think you're good enough.

01:14:02.075 --> 01:14:07.213
Like we have to always
be extraordinary.

01:14:07.247 --> 01:14:11.251
But somehow,
we're always doing it wrong.

01:14:14.254 --> 01:14:15.989
You have to be thin
but not too thin,

01:14:16.022 --> 01:14:18.157
and you can never say
you want to be thin.

01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:20.293
You have to say
you want to be healthy,

01:14:20.326 --> 01:14:23.997
but also you have to be thin.

01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:26.899
You have to have money,
but you can't ask for money

01:14:26.933 --> 01:14:28.434
because that's crass.

01:14:31.104 --> 01:14:33.039
You have to be a boss
but you can't be mean.

01:14:33.072 --> 01:14:35.875
You have to lead,
but you can't squash
other people's ideas.

01:14:35.908 --> 01:14:37.377
You're supposed to love
being a mother,

01:14:37.410 --> 01:14:39.579
but don't talk about your kids
all the damn time.

01:14:39.612 --> 01:14:41.347
You have to be
a career woman

01:14:41.381 --> 01:14:44.817
but also always
be looking out
for other people.

01:14:44.851 --> 01:14:47.954
You have to answer for men's
bad behavior, which is insane,

01:14:47.987 --> 01:14:50.923
but if you point that out,
you're accused of complaining.

01:14:50.957 --> 01:14:53.393
You're supposed to stay pretty
for men but not so pretty

01:14:53.426 --> 01:14:54.894
that you tempt them too much

01:14:54.927 --> 01:14:56.429
or that you threaten
other women

01:14:56.462 --> 01:14:58.197
because you're supposed to be
a part of the sisterhood

01:14:58.231 --> 01:14:59.999
but always stand out.

01:15:00.033 --> 01:15:02.535
And always be grateful.

01:15:02.568 --> 01:15:04.437
But never forget
that the system is rigged,

01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:06.072
so find a way
to acknowledge that

01:15:06.105 --> 01:15:08.141
but also always be grateful.

01:15:08.174 --> 01:15:10.143
You have to never get old,

01:15:10.176 --> 01:15:13.079
never be rude,
never show off,

01:15:13.112 --> 01:15:15.315
never be selfish,
never fall down,

01:15:15.348 --> 01:15:17.317
never fail, never show fear,

01:15:17.350 --> 01:15:19.218
never get out of line.

01:15:19.252 --> 01:15:21.921
It's too hard,
it's too contradictory,

01:15:21.954 --> 01:15:24.957
and nobody gives you a medal
or says thank you.

01:15:24.991 --> 01:15:26.392
And it turns out, in fact,

01:15:26.426 --> 01:15:27.593
that not only
are you doing everything wrong

01:15:27.627 --> 01:15:30.196
but also
everything is your fault.

01:15:35.268 --> 01:15:38.938
I'm just so tired
of watching myself

01:15:38.971 --> 01:15:42.875
and every single other woman

01:15:42.909 --> 01:15:47.213
tie herself into knots
so that people will like us.

01:15:50.583 --> 01:15:52.452
And if all of that

01:15:53.453 --> 01:15:56.255
is also true for a doll

01:15:57.523 --> 01:16:01.527
just representing a woman...

01:16:04.163 --> 01:16:06.632
then I don't even know.

01:16:13.005 --> 01:16:13.906
Wait.

01:16:15.241 --> 01:16:17.443
I did write a book.

01:16:17.477 --> 01:16:19.545
It's like I've been in a dream,

01:16:19.579 --> 01:16:22.582
where I was somehow
really invested

01:16:22.615 --> 01:16:25.418
in the Zack Snyder cut
of <i>Justice League.</i>

01:16:27.286 --> 01:16:30.223
But what you said
broke me out of it.

01:16:31.157 --> 01:16:32.091
Really?

01:16:32.125 --> 01:16:33.226
Yeah.

01:16:33.259 --> 01:16:35.194
You're back. She's back.

01:16:35.228 --> 01:16:37.463
By giving voice
to the cognitive
dissonance required

01:16:37.497 --> 01:16:39.165
to be a woman
under the patriarchy,

01:16:39.198 --> 01:16:41.267
-you robbed it of its power.
-Yes.

01:16:42.969 --> 01:16:44.270
Wow, I just said all of that.

01:16:44.303 --> 01:16:46.939
Hell, yes, White Savior Barbie!

01:16:46.973 --> 01:16:50.209
No, it was your mom.
Your mom did the saving.

01:16:50.243 --> 01:16:52.278
We have to stop the Kens.

01:16:52.311 --> 01:16:54.547
And you need to say
all of those things
to the other Barbies.

01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:56.048
-That's the key.
-Got it.

01:16:56.082 --> 01:16:57.316
But how are we gonna
get the Barbies

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:58.985
away from their Kens?

01:16:59.018 --> 01:17:00.420
We have experience
with a world like this one.

01:17:00.453 --> 01:17:02.021
Do you have a map
of Barbie Land?

01:17:02.054 --> 01:17:04.056
What do you think?

01:17:06.759 --> 01:17:08.428
- Wow.
- Thanks.
I built it.

01:17:08.461 --> 01:17:09.662
Okay, here's the deal.

01:17:09.695 --> 01:17:11.364
It's not just about
how they see us,

01:17:11.397 --> 01:17:13.166
it's about
how they see themselves.

01:17:13.199 --> 01:17:16.135
Ken Land contains the seeds
of its own destruction.

01:17:16.169 --> 01:17:19.105
First we have to get
the Barbies
away from their Kens.

01:17:19.138 --> 01:17:22.341
We could use a decoy Barbie
who pretends to be brainwashed.

01:17:22.375 --> 01:17:23.609
-That should be you.
-Cool.

01:17:30.616 --> 01:17:33.219
<i>Distract them</i>
<i>by appearing</i>
<i>helpless and confused.</i>

01:17:33.252 --> 01:17:35.488
<i>Kens cannot resist</i>
<i>a damsel in distress.</i>

01:17:35.521 --> 01:17:38.090
<i>You have</i>
<i>to make them believe</i>
<i>that you're complacent.</i>

01:17:38.124 --> 01:17:40.026
<i>That they have the power.</i>

01:17:40.059 --> 01:17:42.495
<i>And when their guard is down,</i>
<i>you take the power back.</i>

01:17:45.498 --> 01:17:47.567
The influence that Porsche 356

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:49.702
has had on the motoring world
as a whole,

01:17:49.735 --> 01:17:51.103
it can't be overstated.

01:17:51.137 --> 01:17:53.339
Oh! Photoshop is so hard!

01:17:53.372 --> 01:17:55.608
I just don't understand
how to use the Select tool.

01:17:55.641 --> 01:17:57.510
Honey, you can only use
the Select tool

01:17:57.543 --> 01:17:59.111
if the layer is highlighted.

01:17:59.145 --> 01:18:00.179
Let me show you.

01:18:00.213 --> 01:18:01.581
My tiny head is just swimming

01:18:01.614 --> 01:18:03.549
with technical jargon
like color bands...

01:18:03.583 --> 01:18:06.385
-Oh! Hi.
-...and magnetic lassos
and bit maps.

01:18:06.419 --> 01:18:08.554
Do you think that you and your
strong arms can explain...

01:18:08.588 --> 01:18:10.623
- Oh! What's happening?
- Allan, go around!

01:18:10.656 --> 01:18:11.591
Ahh!

01:18:13.059 --> 01:18:14.427
-Oh, but what about Ken?
-No, no, no!

01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.230
- No, but I love him!
- Come on, Allan!

01:18:17.263 --> 01:18:19.632
Hey!
What's gonna happen to Ken?

01:18:19.665 --> 01:18:21.167
Just listen.

01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:22.502
You have to be their mommies

01:18:22.535 --> 01:18:24.203
but not remind them
of their mommy.

01:18:24.237 --> 01:18:26.339
Any power you have
must be masked under a giggle.

01:18:29.108 --> 01:18:30.109
What happened?

01:18:30.142 --> 01:18:31.577
One minute I was president,

01:18:31.611 --> 01:18:34.447
and the next I was cutting
a Ken steak for him.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:36.516
Welcome back, Madam President.

01:18:36.549 --> 01:18:40.086
Then we'll recruit the now
unbrainwashed Barbies
to our cause.

01:18:40.119 --> 01:18:42.288
<i>They can be</i>
<i>the new decoys.</i>

01:18:42.321 --> 01:18:44.257
<i>You can tell him</i>
<i>that you've never seen</i>
The Godfather.

01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:46.792
<i>And that you'd love them</i>
<i>to explain it to you.</i>

01:18:46.827 --> 01:18:49.529
Ooh, are you guys
watching <i>The Godfather?</i>

01:18:49.562 --> 01:18:50.763
<i>The Godfather.</i>

01:18:50.796 --> 01:18:52.465
I've never seen it.

01:18:52.498 --> 01:18:54.300
Oh, my God.
You've never seen
<i>The Godfather?</i>

01:18:54.333 --> 01:18:56.502
This movie is a rich blend
of Coppola's aesthetic genius

01:18:56.536 --> 01:18:58.170
and a triumph for Robert Evans

01:18:58.204 --> 01:18:59.672
and the architecture
of the '70s studio system.

01:18:59.705 --> 01:19:01.140
Can you
start the movie over

01:19:01.173 --> 01:19:02.542
and just talk
through the whole thing?

01:19:02.575 --> 01:19:04.443
You have to find a way
to reject men's advances

01:19:04.477 --> 01:19:06.145
without damaging their egos.

01:19:06.178 --> 01:19:07.547
Because if you say yes to them,
you're a tramp,

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.515
but if you say no to them,
you're a prude.

01:19:11.250 --> 01:19:12.652
I don't wanna touch a foot.

01:19:12.685 --> 01:19:14.086
No, you don't.

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.355
Another one,
be confused about money.

01:19:16.389 --> 01:19:18.791
I just have all my money
in a savings account.

01:19:18.825 --> 01:19:20.493
That's totally wrong.
You need treasury bonds,

01:19:20.526 --> 01:19:21.727
corporate bonds, CDs.

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:23.563
No one has CDs anymore.

01:19:23.596 --> 01:19:26.365
Oh, sweetheart, you are so cute
when you're confused.

01:19:26.399 --> 01:19:28.200
But no, not music.

01:19:28.234 --> 01:19:30.603
CD stands for
Certificate of Deposit.

01:19:30.636 --> 01:19:33.239
Stephen Malkmus
really harnessed
the acerbic talk-singing

01:19:33.272 --> 01:19:34.774
of Lou Reed
with post-punk influences

01:19:34.808 --> 01:19:36.776
such as Wire and The Fall.

01:19:36.810 --> 01:19:38.711
What am I wearing?
I would never choose this.

01:19:38.744 --> 01:19:41.314
Because you're a physicist.
Do you want some pants?

01:19:41.347 --> 01:19:42.381
Yeah.

01:19:44.150 --> 01:19:45.651
Welcome back, Barbie.

01:19:45.685 --> 01:19:48.654
Gee, I am so awkward
and don't feel pretty at all,

01:19:48.688 --> 01:19:50.590
and will anyone ever like me?

01:19:50.623 --> 01:19:52.558
<i>Or distract them</i>
<i>with the old standby.</i>

01:19:52.592 --> 01:19:54.727
<i>Wearing glasses so they can</i>
<i>discover that you're pretty.</i>

01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:56.596
-May I?
-Sure. Go ahead.

01:20:00.867 --> 01:20:04.704
There. Now we can see
your beautiful face.

01:20:04.737 --> 01:20:06.873
And then there's pretending
to be terrible

01:20:06.907 --> 01:20:08.474
at every sport ever.

01:20:08.507 --> 01:20:10.509
Here, let me show you.

01:20:10.543 --> 01:20:12.345
Here, let me show you.

01:20:12.378 --> 01:20:14.580
-Here, let me show you.
-Here, let me show you.

01:20:14.614 --> 01:20:16.817
Here, let us show you.

01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:19.251
We'll do this
until every single Barbie

01:20:19.285 --> 01:20:21.855
is deprogrammed and ready
to take back Barbie Land.

01:20:21.888 --> 01:20:22.923
-Yes!
-Yes!

01:20:22.956 --> 01:20:24.357
Yeah!

01:20:28.661 --> 01:20:33.232
Hey! Tomorrow the Kens vote
to change the Constitution,

01:20:33.265 --> 01:20:34.634
so we have to get there first.

01:20:34.667 --> 01:20:36.268
The final stage of our plan,

01:20:36.302 --> 01:20:38.537
to turn the Kens
against each other.

01:20:38.571 --> 01:20:40.807
Now that they think
they have power over you,

01:20:40.841 --> 01:20:43.209
you make them question whether
they have enough power

01:20:43.242 --> 01:20:44.610
over each other.

01:20:44.644 --> 01:20:46.847
What if this doesn't work?

01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:48.247
What if he doesn't...

01:20:49.749 --> 01:20:51.283
like me anymore?

01:20:52.585 --> 01:20:55.521
-He likes you.
-He was really upset.

01:20:56.722 --> 01:20:58.591
Because he likes you.

01:20:58.624 --> 01:21:00.359
And because he knows deep down

01:21:00.393 --> 01:21:02.495
that you don't like him
the same way.

01:21:02.528 --> 01:21:04.296
It still doesn't mean
I want to hurt him.

01:21:05.631 --> 01:21:07.500
He took your house.

01:21:07.533 --> 01:21:08.802
He brainwashed your friends.

01:21:08.835 --> 01:21:10.770
He wants to control
the government.

01:21:10.804 --> 01:21:12.304
True.

01:21:12.338 --> 01:21:14.507
- Girl.
- Yeah.

01:21:14.540 --> 01:21:16.342
-Wow.
-Yeah.

01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:18.678
It's like I'm a woman already.

01:21:18.711 --> 01:21:20.346
Welcome.

01:21:20.379 --> 01:21:21.781
Is this what it's like?

01:21:21.815 --> 01:21:23.749
It's time.

01:21:23.783 --> 01:21:24.951
I'm ready.

01:21:25.986 --> 01:21:27.186
Thank you.

01:21:27.854 --> 01:21:28.788
Here I go.

01:21:35.628 --> 01:21:37.797
Hi.

01:21:40.766 --> 01:21:42.903
Ahh!

01:21:46.807 --> 01:21:49.408
Oh, hey.
You've caught me reading.

01:21:49.442 --> 01:21:51.444
Oh.

01:21:51.477 --> 01:21:52.778
-I've been thinking.
-Mm-hmm.

01:21:52.813 --> 01:21:54.780
- Ken Land.
- Kendom.

01:21:54.815 --> 01:21:56.415
-Kendom.
-Kendom Land.

01:21:56.449 --> 01:21:57.750
-Land of the--
-Land of the free and the men.

01:21:57.783 --> 01:21:59.518
Right. Well, this place is...

01:21:59.552 --> 01:22:00.821
Kendom Land.

01:22:00.854 --> 01:22:02.421
...really great.

01:22:02.455 --> 01:22:04.790
And the Kens really
are just better at ruling

01:22:04.825 --> 01:22:06.759
than the Barbies ever were.

01:22:06.792 --> 01:22:09.395
Well, we just took
patriarchy and you know,
made a patriarchy.

01:22:09.428 --> 01:22:11.597
-Yeah, well, I was thinking...
-Yes?

01:22:11.630 --> 01:22:15.501
I'm ready to be
your long-term-distance

01:22:15.534 --> 01:22:17.603
low-commitment
casual girlfriend,

01:22:17.636 --> 01:22:18.972
if you'll still have me.

01:22:20.874 --> 01:22:22.341
Would you just hold on
for one second?

01:22:22.374 --> 01:22:23.409
Oh, okay.

01:22:28.781 --> 01:22:29.850
Sublime!

01:22:34.087 --> 01:22:35.889
I don't know. I'm gonna
have to think about that.

01:22:35.922 --> 01:22:36.789
Oh.

01:22:38.657 --> 01:22:39.525
Please?

01:22:42.461 --> 01:22:43.796
Okay.

01:22:43.830 --> 01:22:45.765
Come on in.
I'll play the guitar at you.

01:22:45.798 --> 01:22:47.433
Oh, yay!

01:22:58.544 --> 01:23:02.782
<i>♪ Said I don't know if I've</i>
<i>Ever been good enough ♪</i>

01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:04.717

That's a beautiful song
that you're playing.

01:24:39.913 --> 01:24:41.480
Did you write it?

01:24:41.513 --> 01:24:43.449
Yes. You want to sit here
and watch me do it,

01:24:43.482 --> 01:24:44.985
while I stare uncomfortably
into your eyes

01:24:45.018 --> 01:24:46.920

<i>While they're</i>

01:25:13.213 --> 01:25:15.748
Does the title of
long-term-distance casual

01:25:15.781 --> 01:25:17.984
low-commitment girlfriend
mean nothing?

01:25:18.018 --> 01:25:19.451
What do we do?

01:25:19.485 --> 01:25:21.922
We beach every individual
one of them off.

01:25:21.955 --> 01:25:22.856
No.

01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:26.458
We go to war.

01:25:26.492 --> 01:25:28.161
-Against the Barbies?
-No, against the Kens.

01:25:28.194 --> 01:25:29.728
-But we are the Kens.
-The other Kens.

01:25:29.762 --> 01:25:31.097
We should probably
call them something else

01:25:31.131 --> 01:25:32.598
so it doesn't get confusing.

01:25:32.631 --> 01:25:33.833
No, because we'll know
what we mean.

01:25:33.867 --> 01:25:35.101
But when we're
on the battlefield

01:25:35.135 --> 01:25:36.903
and you say
"Ken at four o'clock,"

01:25:36.937 --> 01:25:38.238
how will I know if you mean
us Kens or the other Kens?

01:25:38.271 --> 01:25:40.006
Because, my dudes,
we attack at ten o'clock

01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.242
and take advantage
of the morning waves.

01:25:42.275 --> 01:25:44.911
But not so early 'cause we're
gonna want to sleep in.

01:25:44.945 --> 01:25:46.478
Right.

01:25:46.512 --> 01:25:47.713
But what will we fight with?
We have no guns.

01:25:47.746 --> 01:25:49.883
Tennis rackets and volleyballs.

01:25:49.916 --> 01:25:51.550
And slap fights.

01:25:51.583 --> 01:25:52.618
And beach offs.

01:25:52.651 --> 01:25:54.553

All those in favor of letting

01:31:17.543 --> 01:31:19.178
say "Aye."

01:31:19.212 --> 01:31:20.413

01:31:34.227 --> 01:31:36.329

01:31:55.014 --> 01:31:56.582
Is it just my imagination,

01:31:56.616 --> 01:32:01.621
or did these Mojo Dojo
Casa Houses just get dreamier?

01:32:01.654 --> 01:32:04.324
That's because they're
Dreamhouses, mother....

01:32:04.357 --> 01:32:05.992
That's right.

01:32:06.025 --> 01:32:07.994
We've reinstated
the Barbie Land Constitution

01:32:08.027 --> 01:32:09.529
to what it should be.

01:32:09.562 --> 01:32:12.365
And restored all the Barbies'
brains and autonomy.

01:32:12.398 --> 01:32:13.333
Yes!

01:32:16.169 --> 01:32:18.905
And we seriously disinfected
those houses.

01:32:18.938 --> 01:32:19.939
What do we do?

01:32:21.908 --> 01:32:23.076

01:32:25.111 --> 01:32:27.213
-Who are we attacking, sir?
-No...

01:32:29.382 --> 01:32:30.416
No...

01:32:34.053 --> 01:32:35.888
Don't look at me!

01:32:36.656 --> 01:32:38.491
Is he crying?

01:32:38.524 --> 01:32:40.259
Just give us a minute.

01:32:45.465 --> 01:32:47.200
Ken.

01:32:49.635 --> 01:32:51.037
Are you okay?

01:32:51.070 --> 01:32:52.572
Yeah. Totally.

01:32:52.605 --> 01:32:54.407
It's okay
if you're crying.

01:32:54.440 --> 01:32:56.943
You know, I cried too.
It's actually kind of amazing.

01:32:56.976 --> 01:32:59.345
I'm a liberated man.
I know crying is not weak.

01:32:59.379 --> 01:33:01.481
Okay.

01:33:03.015 --> 01:33:04.050
You wanna sit up for a minute?

01:33:09.489 --> 01:33:11.457
This, uh...

01:33:11.491 --> 01:33:13.326
It was hard running stuff.

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:16.396
I didn't love it.

01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:18.564
I get it.

01:33:23.202 --> 01:33:25.204
And those mini-fridges
are so small.

01:33:25.238 --> 01:33:27.173
- Mm-hmm.
-You could only fit a six pack in them.

01:33:27.206 --> 01:33:30.476
And the freezers
are basically useless.

01:33:32.345 --> 01:33:34.080
To be honest, when I found out

01:33:34.113 --> 01:33:35.548
that patriarchy wasn't
about horses,

01:33:35.581 --> 01:33:37.216
I lost interest anyway.

01:33:38.384 --> 01:33:39.619
That's okay.

01:33:44.757 --> 01:33:47.493
I always thought this
would be our house.

01:33:50.363 --> 01:33:51.497
Oh.

01:33:54.233 --> 01:33:58.037
Ken.

01:33:58.070 --> 01:34:00.573
-I think I owe you an apology.
-Huh?

01:34:00.606 --> 01:34:02.575
I'm really sorry
I took you for granted.

01:34:02.608 --> 01:34:05.111
Oh.

01:34:05.144 --> 01:34:07.447
Not every night
had to be girls' night.

01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:13.052
Thank you
for saying that.

01:34:13.085 --> 01:34:15.354
Thank you.

01:34:17.323 --> 01:34:20.760
Oh. I didn't mean
to suggest, uh...

01:34:20.793 --> 01:34:23.362
I just don't know who I am
without you.

01:34:24.697 --> 01:34:26.332
You're Ken.

01:34:27.333 --> 01:34:30.403
But it's "Barbie and Ken."

01:34:31.671 --> 01:34:34.607
There is no just "Ken."

01:34:35.708 --> 01:34:37.643
That's why I was created.

01:34:37.677 --> 01:34:39.345
I only exist

01:34:41.214 --> 01:34:43.149
within the warmth of your gaze.

01:34:44.383 --> 01:34:46.686
Without it,

01:34:46.719 --> 01:34:50.523
I'm just another blond guy
who can't do flips.

01:35:00.733 --> 01:35:05.037
Maybe it's time
to discover who Ken is.

01:35:05.071 --> 01:35:07.373
- Okay. I think I get it now.
- Okay.

01:35:07.406 --> 01:35:10.776
No, no, no!
This isn't the answer.

01:35:13.346 --> 01:35:14.614
I feel so stupid.

01:35:14.647 --> 01:35:16.182
- No.
- No.

01:35:16.215 --> 01:35:18.551
- I look so stupid.
- Yeah.

01:35:18.584 --> 01:35:21.120
I look so stupid!

01:35:21.153 --> 01:35:24.390
- No!
- So cool. You look so cool.

01:35:24.423 --> 01:35:26.792
Okay. Ken,
you have to figure out

01:35:26.827 --> 01:35:28.628
who you are without me.

01:35:29.495 --> 01:35:31.397
Why?

01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:33.266
You're not your girlfriend.

01:35:33.299 --> 01:35:36.168
You're not your house,
you're not your mink.

01:35:36.202 --> 01:35:38.137
- Beach?
- Nope.

01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:40.172
You're not even beach.

01:35:40.206 --> 01:35:44.277
Maybe all the things
that you thought made you you

01:35:44.310 --> 01:35:48.281
aren't... really you.

01:35:53.119 --> 01:35:55.454
Maybe it's Barbie and...

01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:59.191
it's Ken.

01:36:02.395 --> 01:36:05.498
Ken is...

01:36:07.333 --> 01:36:08.234
me?

01:36:08.267 --> 01:36:09.435
Yes.

01:36:09.468 --> 01:36:12.271
Ken is me!

01:36:13.506 --> 01:36:15.241
And I'm Barbie.

01:36:17.743 --> 01:36:19.211
Ken...

01:36:20.814 --> 01:36:21.815
is me!

01:36:21.848 --> 01:36:23.115
Ken is me!

01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:24.483
-Ken is me!
-Ken is me!

01:36:25.785 --> 01:36:26.820
I don't even care
about being Ken anymore.

01:36:26.853 --> 01:36:28.154
I just miss my friend Barbie!

01:36:28.187 --> 01:36:29.722
-That's cool!
-Barbie!

01:36:29.755 --> 01:36:31.457
I'm right here.

01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:32.491
Ken!

01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:39.465
I want you to have it.

01:36:39.498 --> 01:36:41.601
Aw. That's nice.

01:36:49.175 --> 01:36:51.812
We were only fighting
because we didn't know
who we were.

01:36:54.246 --> 01:36:58.784
Ken is me!

01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.195
Ken is right.

01:37:09.228 --> 01:37:11.697
It's just so hard
to be a leader.

01:37:11.731 --> 01:37:13.599
-You know?
-That's my boss.

01:37:13.633 --> 01:37:15.836
It's... Oh.

01:37:15.869 --> 01:37:17.838
Midge, gosh.

01:37:17.871 --> 01:37:19.639
I thought we discontinued her.

01:37:21.774 --> 01:37:24.443
Look,
do you know how many times

01:37:24.477 --> 01:37:27.780
I've wanted to stand up
in a board meeting
and just say,

01:37:27.814 --> 01:37:29.850
"Can we just
tickle each other?"

01:37:29.883 --> 01:37:31.584
-Really?
-Let's have a company retreat

01:37:31.617 --> 01:37:33.352
and just tickle each other.

01:37:33.386 --> 01:37:35.488
- Someone get me.
Someone get me.

01:37:36.957 --> 01:37:38.825
I love being tickled.

01:37:38.859 --> 01:37:41.895
No, no, no. Don't hug me.
Don't hug me.

01:37:44.697 --> 01:37:46.732
But thanks to the Barbies,

01:37:46.766 --> 01:37:50.269
I, too, can now relieve
myself of this heavy
existential burden

01:37:50.302 --> 01:37:54.306
while holding on to
the very real title of CEO.

01:37:54.340 --> 01:37:56.810
And we can restore
everything in Barbie Land

01:37:56.843 --> 01:37:58.577
to exactly the way it was.

01:37:58.611 --> 01:38:02.281
-Mister Mattel, I just--
-Please. Call me Mother.

01:38:02.314 --> 01:38:03.649
No, thank you.

01:38:03.683 --> 01:38:05.451
I don't think
that things should go back

01:38:05.484 --> 01:38:06.953
to the way that they were.

01:38:06.987 --> 01:38:10.556
No Barbie or Ken should be
living in the shadows.

01:38:10.589 --> 01:38:11.892
Or Allan.

01:38:12.859 --> 01:38:14.260
-Hey.
-Me?

01:38:14.293 --> 01:38:15.962
-Yeah.
-Oh. Hello.

01:38:15.996 --> 01:38:17.396
I just want to say,

01:38:17.430 --> 01:38:18.698
I'm sorry
we called you Weird Barbie

01:38:18.731 --> 01:38:20.366
behind your back
and also to your face.

01:38:20.399 --> 01:38:22.635
That's okay. I'm owning it.

01:38:22.668 --> 01:38:24.537
Would you like a job
in my cabinet?

01:38:24.570 --> 01:38:26.639
May I please have sanitation?

01:38:27.707 --> 01:38:29.308
It's yours.

01:38:29.341 --> 01:38:30.877
- Yeah, thank you.
- All right.

01:38:30.911 --> 01:38:32.611
-Madam President.
-Oh.

01:38:32.645 --> 01:38:35.581
Please, may the Kens have
one Supreme Court Justice?

01:38:35.614 --> 01:38:39.685
Oh, I can't do that.
But maybe a lower circuit
court judgeship.

01:38:39.719 --> 01:38:41.654
We accept.
As long as we can wear robes.

01:38:41.687 --> 01:38:43.890
<i>Well, the Kens</i>
<i>have to start somewhere.</i>

01:38:43.924 --> 01:38:45.859
<i>And one day,</i>
<i>the Kens will have</i>

01:38:45.892 --> 01:38:48.360
<i>as much power and influence</i>
<i>in Barbie Land</i>

01:38:48.394 --> 01:38:51.297
<i>as women have</i>
<i>in the Real World.</i>

01:38:51.330 --> 01:38:52.465
No, I don't want to.

01:38:52.498 --> 01:38:53.766
-Just go!
-I can't.

01:38:53.799 --> 01:38:56.769
-Grow up and go.
-I have an idea.

01:38:56.803 --> 01:38:58.571
Tell me your secret dream,
child.

01:38:58.604 --> 01:39:01.908
Okay,
what about Ordinary Barbie?

01:39:01.942 --> 01:39:04.945
She's not extraordinary.
She's not president
of anything,

01:39:04.978 --> 01:39:06.345
or maybe she is.

01:39:06.378 --> 01:39:08.314
Maybe she's a mom.
Maybe she's not.

01:39:08.347 --> 01:39:11.617
Because it's okay
to just want to be a mom,

01:39:11.650 --> 01:39:13.920
or to wanna be president
or a mom who is president.

01:39:13.954 --> 01:39:15.721
Or not a mom
who's also not president.

01:39:15.755 --> 01:39:17.858
She just has a flattering top,

01:39:17.891 --> 01:39:19.391
and she wants
to get through the day

01:39:19.425 --> 01:39:21.962
feeling kinda good
about herself.

01:39:24.363 --> 01:39:26.599
That's a terrible idea.

01:39:26.632 --> 01:39:28.001
Yeah,
that's going to make money.

01:39:28.034 --> 01:39:31.737
Oh. Ordinary Barbie.
I love it. Fantastic.

01:39:31.771 --> 01:39:32.906
Okay, great.

01:39:32.939 --> 01:39:34.507
-Great.
-Cool.

01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:35.741
-Yes.
-We good?

01:39:35.775 --> 01:39:36.943
I think we're good, right?

01:39:36.977 --> 01:39:38.879
All right, let's begin the work

01:39:38.912 --> 01:39:41.747
to close the portal
between our two worlds.

01:39:41.781 --> 01:39:43.783
Hey, what about Barbie?

01:39:43.817 --> 01:39:45.018
What do you mean?

01:39:45.051 --> 01:39:46.619
Yeah,
what about Barbie?

01:39:46.652 --> 01:39:50.723
What's her ending?
What does she get?

01:39:50.756 --> 01:39:53.559
Well, that's easy.
She's in love with Ken.

01:39:53.592 --> 01:39:56.029
- Aw.
- That is not her ending.

01:39:58.364 --> 01:40:00.399
- I'm not in love with Ken.
- Oh.

01:40:00.432 --> 01:40:01.467
What do you want?

01:40:03.469 --> 01:40:04.838
I don't know. I'm...

01:40:06.973 --> 01:40:09.742
I'm not really sure
where I belong anymore.

01:40:14.647 --> 01:40:16.515
I don't think I have an ending.

01:40:16.549 --> 01:40:18.584
That was
always the point.

01:40:18.617 --> 01:40:21.787
I created you
so you wouldn't have an ending.

01:40:23.489 --> 01:40:24.623
It's you.

01:40:26.993 --> 01:40:28.829
You're Ruth from Mattel.

01:40:28.862 --> 01:40:31.630
Baby, I am Mattel.

01:40:31.664 --> 01:40:34.600
Until the IRS got to me,
but that's another movie.

01:40:34.633 --> 01:40:35.869
So, you're...

01:40:35.902 --> 01:40:38.939
Ruth Handler.
Inventor of Barbie.

01:40:38.972 --> 01:40:40.106
What?

01:40:40.140 --> 01:40:41.674
That's so cool.

01:40:41.707 --> 01:40:43.877
Her ghost keeps an office
on the 17th floor.

01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:44.878
- What?
- What?

01:40:44.911 --> 01:40:46.679
You guys,

01:40:46.712 --> 01:40:49.582
you think the lady who invented
Barbie looks like Barbie?

01:40:49.615 --> 01:40:51.750
I'm a five-foot-nothing grandma

01:40:51.784 --> 01:40:53.452
with a double mastectomy...

01:40:53.485 --> 01:40:55.621
...and tax evasion issues.

01:40:55.654 --> 01:40:58.091
Nobody looks like Barbie,

01:40:58.124 --> 01:41:01.660
except, of course, Barbie.
Take a bow, honey.

01:41:03.729 --> 01:41:06.498
I don't really feel
like Barbie anymore.

01:41:10.603 --> 01:41:12.438
Come, walk with me.

01:41:32.558 --> 01:41:33.592
Thank you.

01:41:35.594 --> 01:41:36.762
Thank you, Barbie.

01:41:38.865 --> 01:41:39.765
Thank you.

01:41:49.775 --> 01:41:51.777
I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do now.

01:41:51.811 --> 01:41:54.480
I've always been
Stereotypical Barbie,

01:41:54.513 --> 01:41:57.817
and I don't think I'm really
good at anything else.

01:41:57.851 --> 01:42:00.020
You saved Barbie Land
from patriarchy.

01:42:00.053 --> 01:42:02.822
That was very much
a group effort.

01:42:02.856 --> 01:42:05.791
And you helped that mother
and daughter connect.

01:42:05.825 --> 01:42:07.459
They really helped each other.

01:42:08.828 --> 01:42:11.164
Maybe
you're Self-Effacing Barbie?

01:42:13.099 --> 01:42:14.968
Maybe I'm not Barbie anymore.

01:42:24.244 --> 01:42:28.081
You understand that humans
only have one ending.

01:42:28.114 --> 01:42:32.518
Ideas live forever,
humans not so much.

01:42:32.551 --> 01:42:33.887
You know that, right?

01:42:33.920 --> 01:42:35.487
I do.

01:42:35.521 --> 01:42:38.024
Being a human
can be pretty uncomfortable.

01:42:39.525 --> 01:42:40.994
I know.

01:42:41.027 --> 01:42:45.098
Humans make things up
like patriarchy and Barbie

01:42:45.131 --> 01:42:47.901
just to deal
with how uncomfortable it is.

01:42:48.767 --> 01:42:50.569
I understand that.

01:42:50.602 --> 01:42:51.905
And then you die.

01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:54.975
Yeah.

01:42:57.043 --> 01:42:58.078
Yeah.

01:43:04.851 --> 01:43:08.989
I want to be
a part of the people

01:43:09.022 --> 01:43:10.824
that make meaning.

01:43:12.258 --> 01:43:14.194
Not the thing that's made.

01:43:16.896 --> 01:43:19.833
I want to do the imagining.
I don't wanna be the idea.

01:43:19.866 --> 01:43:22.002
Does that make sense?

01:43:22.035 --> 01:43:24.204
I always knew that Barbie
would surprise me,

01:43:24.237 --> 01:43:27.240
but I never expected this.

01:43:27.273 --> 01:43:31.811
Do you give me permission
to become human?

01:43:31.845 --> 01:43:33.880
You don't need my permission.

01:43:33.913 --> 01:43:37.683
But you're the creator.
You... Don't you control me?

01:43:37.716 --> 01:43:39.152
I can't control you

01:43:39.185 --> 01:43:42.654
any more than I can control
my own daughter.

01:43:42.688 --> 01:43:45.025
I named you after her,
Barbara.

01:43:45.058 --> 01:43:48.962
And I always hoped for you
like I hoped for her.

01:43:50.030 --> 01:43:51.865
We mothers stand still

01:43:51.898 --> 01:43:55.869
so our daughters can look back
to see how far they've come.

01:44:01.207 --> 01:44:04.610
So, being human's not
something I need to...

01:44:04.643 --> 01:44:08.747
ask for or even want?
I can just...

01:44:10.682 --> 01:44:12.919
It's something
that I just discover I am?

01:44:15.021 --> 01:44:17.689
I can't in good conscience
let you take this leap

01:44:17.723 --> 01:44:19.758
without you knowing
what it means.

01:44:23.662 --> 01:44:24.864
Take my hands.

01:44:31.838 --> 01:44:33.239
Now close your eyes.

01:44:43.883 --> 01:44:45.218
Now feel.

01:44:48.855 --> 01:44:51.690

01:46:02.929 --> 01:46:03.930
Yes.

01:46:17.177 --> 01:46:18.845
<i>So,</i>
<i>Barbie left behind</i>

01:46:18.878 --> 01:46:21.881
<i>the pastels and plastics</i>
<i>of Barbie Land</i>

01:46:21.915 --> 01:46:24.417
<i>for the pastels and plastics</i>
<i>of Los Angeles.</i>

01:46:24.450 --> 01:46:27.287
Okay. Thanks for the lift.

01:46:27.320 --> 01:46:29.088
You got this.

01:46:29.122 --> 01:46:30.456
I'm really proud of you.

01:46:30.490 --> 01:46:34.127
<i>Estoy muy orguoso de ti.</i>

01:46:34.160 --> 01:46:35.862
<i>Orgulloso.</i>

01:46:35.895 --> 01:46:39.065
<i>Orgulloso... Orgulloso de ti.</i>

01:46:39.098 --> 01:46:41.100
There you go. Close enough.

01:46:41.134 --> 01:46:43.203
You guys are the best.
Thank you. Thank you.
