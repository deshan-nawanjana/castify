1
00:02:12.843 --> 00:02:13.633
Hmm?

2
00:02:13.635 --> 00:02:16.837
Hey, I've never seen you before.

3
00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.085
Are you from here?

4
00:02:19.087 --> 00:02:20.458
Are you alone?

5
00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.460
Come here, with us.

6
00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.656
You must be hungry.

7
00:02:31.658 --> 00:02:32.658
Here.

8
00:02:35.362 --> 00:02:37.441
My name's Pil.

9
00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:39.732
The Scratcher and Fluffy.

10
00:02:39.734 --> 00:02:41.730
If you want, you can
be part of our gang.

11
00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:45.184
But first of all, what
are we going to call you?

12
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.346
Wait, I know.

13
00:02:49.348 --> 00:02:50.761
Gobbly.

14
00:02:50.763 --> 00:02:54.382
Come on, I'll explain how
things work around here.

15
00:02:54.384 --> 00:02:58.004
This is our city,
called Foggyborough.

16
00:03:10.036 --> 00:03:12.989
The motto of the city
is, to build the kingdom,

17
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:16.194
one must find where
nobility resides.

18
00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.027
You get it?

19
00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.609
Yeah, me neither.

20
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:20.315
The old king came up with it...

21
00:03:20.317 --> 00:03:21.939
Theobald.

22
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:22.854
See that guy there?

23
00:03:22.856 --> 00:03:24.227
That's Tristain.

24
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:26.601
He's the one who governs right
now, but he's not the king.

25
00:03:26.603 --> 00:03:28.016
He's just the regent.

26
00:03:28.018 --> 00:03:30.846
That's the guy who's going
to be our next king...

27
00:03:30.848 --> 00:03:31.387
Roland.

28
00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:32.219
Prince Roland.

29
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:33.177
Prince Roland.

30
00:03:33.179 --> 00:03:34.176
Prince Roland.

31
00:03:34.178 --> 00:03:35.134
Prince Roland.

32
00:03:35.136 --> 00:03:36.091
Prince Roland.

33
00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:37.049
Prince Roland.

34
00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.006
Prince Roland.

35
00:03:38.008 --> 00:03:39.005
Prince Roland.

36
00:03:39.007 --> 00:03:39.837
Prince Roland.

37
00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:40.421
Prince Roland.

38
00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:41.169
Prince Roland.

39
00:03:41.171 --> 00:03:42.293
Prince Roland.

40
00:03:42.295 --> 00:03:43.167
Prince Roland.

41
00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:44.169
Prince Roland.

42
00:03:51.453 --> 00:03:53.365
To be honest, Gobbly,
we don't really

43
00:03:53.367 --> 00:03:55.280
care who governs around here.

44
00:03:55.282 --> 00:03:56.571
We're orphans.

45
00:03:56.573 --> 00:03:58.486
We live on the street,
and the nobles sure

46
00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.942
aren't going to take care of us.

47
00:04:02.526 --> 00:04:04.563
So we've got to
fend for ourselves.

48
00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:06.269
OK, hold on tight, Gobbly.

49
00:04:06.271 --> 00:04:08.850
Woo-hoooooo!

50
00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.785
Woo-hoo!

51
00:04:31.787 --> 00:04:32.787
Yeah!

52
00:04:41.986 --> 00:04:45.022
You OK, Gobbly?

53
00:04:45.024 --> 00:04:48.104
When we want something
to eat, we go see Crobar.

54
00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:54.846
This time, that pesky
sprite won't escape me.

55
00:04:57.012 --> 00:05:00.131
And Crobar thinks I'm
some kind of sprite.

56
00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:02.005
He thinks I've got magic powers.

57
00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:04.003
Now watch this.

58
00:05:04.005 --> 00:05:08.040
That sprite won't be able
to resist this mince tart.

59
00:05:08.042 --> 00:05:09.042
Oh, cockerel.

60
00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:12.828
You see that?

61
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.785
I'm not dreaming.

62
00:05:13.787 --> 00:05:15.533
I know it's that pesky sprite.

63
00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:18.697
Now, where's he hiding?

64
00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:19.405
A-ha!

65
00:05:19.407 --> 00:05:20.487
There you are, cockerel.

66
00:05:22.528 --> 00:05:25.190
I didn't see that one.

67
00:05:25.192 --> 00:05:26.398
Now, just you wait.

68
00:05:38.263 --> 00:05:39.427
Pesky little sprite.

69
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.290
I'll catch you, cockerel.

70
00:05:51.292 --> 00:05:52.289
Make way.

71
00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:54.077
Make way for Lord Tristain.

72
00:05:59.284 --> 00:06:01.654
What on earth are
you doing, Crobar?

73
00:06:01.656 --> 00:06:03.568
It's that sprite, Lord Tristain.

74
00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.900
I'm trying to catch that
pesky little sprite.

75
00:06:05.902 --> 00:06:07.274
A sprite?

76
00:06:07.276 --> 00:06:10.187
Yes, Lord Tristain, a sprite
that loves to eat mince tarts.

77
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:11.894
And if I manage
to catch him, then

78
00:06:11.896 --> 00:06:17.347
maybe I can become a knight,
and that would be a great...

79
00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:18.595
Achievement?

80
00:06:18.597 --> 00:06:20.551
Crobar, the only
thing you're achieving

81
00:06:20.553 --> 00:06:25.256
is proving you're
a good-for-nothing.

82
00:06:25.258 --> 00:06:26.837
Crobar, a knight.

83
00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:27.839
What a laugh.

84
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.909
Poor Crobar.

85
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:39.032
He's not even close
to becoming a knight.

86
00:06:39.034 --> 00:06:42.571
Anyway, thanks to him we
have mince tarts every day.

87
00:06:42.573 --> 00:06:44.652
Come on, pass me the ball.

88
00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:45.194
Come on.

89
00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:46.276
Here, catch.

90
00:06:46.278 --> 00:06:48.815
Hey.

91
00:06:48.817 --> 00:06:49.731
Hey, over here.

92
00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:50.231
Throw it.

93
00:06:50.233 --> 00:06:50.855
Go on.

94
00:06:50.857 --> 00:06:51.520
Pass it.

95
00:06:51.522 --> 00:06:52.853
OK, throw it to me.

96
00:06:52.855 --> 00:06:54.227
Here.

97
00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:55.932
No, you kicked it too hard.

98
00:06:55.934 --> 00:06:57.099
I kicked it too hard?

99
00:06:57.101 --> 00:06:58.347
I can do what I want.

100
00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:08.337
Come inside right now, children.

101
00:07:08.339 --> 00:07:09.295
That's the sprite.

102
00:07:09.297 --> 00:07:10.297
Don't go near him.

103
00:07:14.125 --> 00:07:15.125
But...

104
00:07:34.688 --> 00:07:35.061
Yay!

105
00:07:35.063 --> 00:07:35.685
Yay!

106
00:07:35.687 --> 00:07:36.687
Yay!

107
00:07:52.835 --> 00:07:55.581
Prince Roland, I've
ruled over this kingdom

108
00:07:55.583 --> 00:07:58.578
since your father died,
and I've done very well.

109
00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.449
Since I've been regent, I've
had the commoners at my feet.

110
00:08:02.451 --> 00:08:04.906
They give me all their
wealth, without complaint,

111
00:08:04.908 --> 00:08:06.196
because they fear me.

112
00:08:06.198 --> 00:08:09.734
I levy more and more taxes,
and they don't oppose me.

113
00:08:09.736 --> 00:08:12.606
And you... you think that
because it's your birthday

114
00:08:12.608 --> 00:08:14.811
I'll just hand you the throne.

115
00:08:14.813 --> 00:08:16.186
Never.

116
00:08:16.188 --> 00:08:18.184
Do you know what I'm going to
give you for your birthday?

117
00:08:18.186 --> 00:08:19.599
This!

118
00:08:19.601 --> 00:08:20.016
Ha!

119
00:08:20.018 --> 00:08:21.181
Ha ha!

120
00:08:21.183 --> 00:08:22.513
Happy birthday.

121
00:08:22.515 --> 00:08:24.302
Here, take that.

122
00:08:24.304 --> 00:08:26.051
Who's the smart one now?

123
00:08:26.053 --> 00:08:26.884
Here, take that.

124
00:08:26.886 --> 00:08:30.213
Uh, Lord Tristain?

125
00:08:30.215 --> 00:08:32.710
I was passing by
and heard noise.

126
00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.459
You OK?

127
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:35.707
Yes, yes.

128
00:08:35.709 --> 00:08:39.745
I just had a little
craving for chicken.

129
00:08:39.747 --> 00:08:40.578
Huh?

130
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:41.410
OK.

131
00:08:41.412 --> 00:08:43.617
Well, good night, Lord Tristain.

132
00:08:43.619 --> 00:08:44.866
Good night, Prince Roland.

133
00:08:47.074 --> 00:08:48.862
It'll be your last.

134
00:09:00.185 --> 00:09:04.179
Hear... Hear ye, hear ye.

135
00:09:04.181 --> 00:09:06.053
Oh, come on.

136
00:09:06.055 --> 00:09:08.842
Enough with the tooting already.

137
00:09:08.844 --> 00:09:10.007
Good.

138
00:09:10.009 --> 00:09:13.170
Hear ye, hear ye, you
citizens of Foggyborough.

139
00:09:13.172 --> 00:09:17.291
Today is the 20th birthday
of our dear Prince Roland.

140
00:09:17.293 --> 00:09:19.831
He's henceforth of age
to take the throne.

141
00:09:19.833 --> 00:09:23.535
Rejoice, and bring food
for the great coronation

142
00:09:23.537 --> 00:09:28.363
banquet for all the
nobles of the realm.

143
00:09:28.365 --> 00:09:29.362
Come forward.

144
00:09:29.364 --> 00:09:30.652
Come no, come on.

145
00:09:30.654 --> 00:09:32.526
Provisions for the
banquet go over there.

146
00:09:32.528 --> 00:09:36.730
Cold meats go in the back,
and vegetables on the side.

147
00:09:36.732 --> 00:09:38.187
Ah, cheese.

148
00:09:38.189 --> 00:09:40.893
Put that in the shade, please.

149
00:09:40.895 --> 00:09:41.641
Hello, good sir.

150
00:09:41.643 --> 00:09:43.515
And what did you bring?

151
00:09:43.517 --> 00:09:46.055
Lovely mince tarts
for the banquet.

152
00:09:46.057 --> 00:09:46.970
Mmm.

153
00:09:46.972 --> 00:09:47.803
Can I see?

154
00:09:47.805 --> 00:09:50.133
No, no, they're for the Prince.

155
00:09:50.135 --> 00:09:53.172
All right, over there.

156
00:10:03.955 --> 00:10:04.661
Go on.

157
00:10:04.663 --> 00:10:05.575
Eat as much as you want.

158
00:10:05.577 --> 00:10:06.952
But keep it down, OK?

159
00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:18.438
Gentlemen, damsels, make way for
the minstrels and troubadours,

160
00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:21.310
who will feel this
castle with music and fun

161
00:10:21.312 --> 00:10:23.517
on this wondrous occasion.

162
00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:26.889
Joy and gaiety
will feel the air.

163
00:10:26.891 --> 00:10:30.135
Forget about your worries,
and enjoy a happy troupe.

164
00:10:34.924 --> 00:10:35.924
Wow.

165
00:10:40.003 --> 00:10:41.332
Come on, Jiggler.

166
00:10:41.334 --> 00:10:44.162
Hurry up.

167
00:10:44.164 --> 00:10:45.370
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

168
00:10:45.372 --> 00:10:46.536
I'm coming, I'm coming.

169
00:10:52.198 --> 00:10:53.405
I'm coming, coming.

170
00:11:01.356 --> 00:11:02.686
Whaaaa...

171
00:11:02.688 --> 00:11:03.688
Jiggler.

172
00:11:07.725 --> 00:11:10.511
Look, Jiggler, you've got
to put a bit of effort, OK?

173
00:11:10.513 --> 00:11:12.218
It's the Prince's
coronation, so we need

174
00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.675
you to give it all you've got.

175
00:11:13.677 --> 00:11:15.173
And try to be funny for once.

176
00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:19.627
Ah, in that case, I think this
is a job for Mr. Destardo.

177
00:11:19.629 --> 00:11:21.000
Hello.

178
00:11:21.002 --> 00:11:23.373
No, no, no, not that puppet.

179
00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:24.622
Oh, come on.

180
00:11:24.624 --> 00:11:26.370
Please, Lugan, just
one or two jokes.

181
00:11:26.372 --> 00:11:28.243
I'm sure they're going
to love Mr. Destardo.

182
00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:30.449
No, they will not
love Mr. Destardo.

183
00:11:30.451 --> 00:11:32.031
Every time you take
out that puppet,

184
00:11:32.033 --> 00:11:33.613
you make fun of the nobles.

185
00:11:33.615 --> 00:11:36.485
No, no, this time it has
nothing to do with them.

186
00:11:36.487 --> 00:11:38.733
It's just a little riddle.

187
00:11:38.735 --> 00:11:43.520
What's the difference between
a rainbow and a noble at work?

188
00:11:43.522 --> 00:11:45.895
You might at least see
a rainbow sometimes.

189
00:11:49.349 --> 00:11:50.596
He's funny, huh?

190
00:11:50.598 --> 00:11:52.219
Jiggler, if you
disrespect Lord Tristain,

191
00:11:52.221 --> 00:11:53.926
he'll lock us up
under the tower.

192
00:11:53.928 --> 00:11:54.509
Understand?

193
00:11:54.511 --> 00:11:56.215
Yes, Lugan.

194
00:11:56.217 --> 00:11:57.339
Come on, let's go.

195
00:11:57.341 --> 00:11:59.212
And put away that puppet.

196
00:11:59.214 --> 00:12:01.419
You heard him, Mr. Destardo.

197
00:12:01.421 --> 00:12:04.998
I'm so sorry, but you
can't go on tonight.

198
00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.579
Lugan, you're censoring me.

199
00:12:07.581 --> 00:12:10.201
I'm not afraid to tell
the truth to the nobles.

200
00:12:10.203 --> 00:12:12.199
You... you just bow to them.

201
00:12:12.201 --> 00:12:13.198
You're a coward, Lugan.

202
00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.281
A coward and a jerk.

203
00:12:14.283 --> 00:12:15.196
Jerk, Lugan.

204
00:12:15.198 --> 00:12:16.237
Jerk, Lugan.

205
00:12:16.239 --> 00:12:17.736
You're a jerk. J...

206
00:12:17.738 --> 00:12:22.189
J... J... jingle bells, jingle
bells, jingle all the way.

207
00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:25.353
Jingle bells, jingle..

208
00:12:25.355 --> 00:12:27.768
No more puppets.

209
00:12:31.848 --> 00:12:33.262
Hello.

210
00:12:33.264 --> 00:12:34.761
Hello.

211
00:12:34.763 --> 00:12:37.840
Do you know how happy
I am to hear you laugh?

212
00:12:37.842 --> 00:12:39.880
You're the first person
to think I'm funny.

213
00:12:39.882 --> 00:12:41.462
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

214
00:12:41.464 --> 00:12:43.168
Hold your horses
there, freckles.

215
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.833
You're not the one
she finds funny.

216
00:12:44.835 --> 00:12:45.750
I am.

217
00:12:45.752 --> 00:12:47.498
You fool, you.

218
00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:50.328
I love what you do with
that little sock puppet.

219
00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:51.327
Excuse me?

220
00:12:51.329 --> 00:12:52.618
What did you call me?

221
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.449
You're the old sock.

222
00:12:54.451 --> 00:12:56.322
This is Mr. Destardo.

223
00:12:56.324 --> 00:12:57.321
My name's Jiggler.

224
00:12:57.323 --> 00:12:58.195
My name's Pil.

225
00:12:58.197 --> 00:12:59.611
Make way.

226
00:12:59.613 --> 00:13:01.941
Make way for Duchess Alienor.

227
00:13:13.515 --> 00:13:15.303
Aunt Alienor, hello.

228
00:13:15.305 --> 00:13:18.175
Oh, Roland, my puddins.

229
00:13:18.177 --> 00:13:19.757
Who is this Duchess Alienor?

230
00:13:19.759 --> 00:13:21.589
She's Prince Roland's aunt.

231
00:13:21.591 --> 00:13:23.712
Oh, you're going to be king.

232
00:13:23.714 --> 00:13:26.667
My brother Theobald
would be so proud of you.

233
00:13:26.669 --> 00:13:29.996
What a great day
for the kingdom.

234
00:13:29.998 --> 00:13:30.787
Come closer, dear.

235
00:13:30.789 --> 00:13:31.662
Come.

236
00:13:31.664 --> 00:13:33.244
There's something you must know.

237
00:13:33.246 --> 00:13:35.949
A short time before
he died, your father

238
00:13:35.951 --> 00:13:38.946
hid a treasure, a treasure
he bequeathed to you.

239
00:13:38.948 --> 00:13:40.278
A treasure?

240
00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.859
A treasure?

241
00:13:41.861 --> 00:13:46.064
He said, in order to find it,
you absolutely have to go...

242
00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:47.354
Did you hear that, Jiggler?

243
00:13:47.356 --> 00:13:49.519
There's a treasure
hidden in Foggyborough.

244
00:13:49.521 --> 00:13:52.641
Oh, it would be great
if I could find it.

245
00:13:52.643 --> 00:13:53.972
Nobility resides.

246
00:13:53.974 --> 00:13:57.136
Do you understand?

247
00:13:57.138 --> 00:13:57.968
No.

248
00:13:57.970 --> 00:13:58.926
Yeah, me neither.

249
00:13:58.928 --> 00:14:00.008
But do think about it.

250
00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:02.506
And whatever you do,
don't tell Tristain.

251
00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.712
If he knew, he might...

252
00:14:03.714 --> 00:14:06.044
Ah, Prince Roland
and Duchess Alienor.

253
00:14:06.046 --> 00:14:09.207
Oh, Tristain, guess
you're unemployed now.

254
00:14:09.209 --> 00:14:10.498
Yes, yes.

255
00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.829
What's with all the trunks?

256
00:14:11.831 --> 00:14:13.203
Are you moving?

257
00:14:13.205 --> 00:14:15.618
Oh, I just brought a selection
of clothes for the ceremony.

258
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:20.238
I want to look presentable
for my nephew's coronation.

259
00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.487
Anyways, I'll leave you be.

260
00:14:21.489 --> 00:14:23.318
I'll go pick out my outfit.

261
00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:24.359
See you.

262
00:14:24.361 --> 00:14:26.440
Your aunt is charming as ever.

263
00:14:26.442 --> 00:14:28.022
Prince, if you
would come with me.

264
00:14:28.024 --> 00:14:32.018
I'd like to speak with
you before the coronation.

265
00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:37.013
I hope that sprite doesn't
come and bother us today.

266
00:14:37.015 --> 00:14:39.760
Say, aren't those the mince
tarts the old man brought?

267
00:14:39.762 --> 00:14:43.507
I better check to see if they're
not too salty because sometimes

268
00:14:43.509 --> 00:14:46.295
they put too much salt.

269
00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:51.249
Mince tarts that bite
and move by themselves?

270
00:14:51.251 --> 00:14:52.251
Cockerel!

271
00:14:58.701 --> 00:14:59.698
Alert!

272
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.239
Alert!

273
00:15:01.241 --> 00:15:03.113
There's an intruder
in the courtyard!

274
00:15:03.115 --> 00:15:05.900
An intruder!

275
00:15:05.902 --> 00:15:07.024
Pesky sprite.

276
00:15:23.177 --> 00:15:25.340
We have to go up to the dungeon?

277
00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:28.253
Yes, what I have to say
is very confidential.

278
00:15:28.255 --> 00:15:32.999
Are dungeons usually
this high up?

279
00:15:54.603 --> 00:15:56.225
No, Gobbly, that's poison.

280
00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:09.046
Hey, isn't that Lord
Tristain, with a sorceress?

281
00:16:09.048 --> 00:16:10.048
Huh?

282
00:16:14.126 --> 00:16:15.165
Oh, no.

283
00:16:15.167 --> 00:16:16.704
Gobbly, don't touch anything.

284
00:16:16.706 --> 00:16:18.619
You want us to get
caught or what?

285
00:16:18.621 --> 00:16:19.621
Huh?

286
00:16:21.077 --> 00:16:22.491
What are these weird potions?

287
00:16:25.572 --> 00:16:27.153
I think you did something here.

288
00:16:38.894 --> 00:16:41.889
Going up stairs and
having armor is tiring.

289
00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:44.760
Yes, well, whose idea was it
to walk around in armor all day

290
00:16:44.762 --> 00:16:45.885
long?

291
00:16:45.887 --> 00:16:48.007
OK, Tristain, what do
you want to talk about?

292
00:16:48.009 --> 00:16:49.172
The throne.

293
00:16:49.174 --> 00:16:50.838
I've been governing
for 15 years,

294
00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.918
waiting for you to come of
age and succeed your father.

295
00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.208
That day has come.

296
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.787
If you don't feel ready, if
you'd rather take more time,

297
00:16:58.789 --> 00:17:01.493
if you'd rather wait
another year or two,

298
00:17:01.495 --> 00:17:03.325
I would understand.

299
00:17:03.327 --> 00:17:05.489
I'd understand completely.

300
00:17:05.491 --> 00:17:07.154
No, Gobbly.

301
00:17:07.156 --> 00:17:08.652
So what do you think?

302
00:17:08.654 --> 00:17:09.819
Would you like that?

303
00:17:09.821 --> 00:17:11.359
I stay a bit longer
on the throne?

304
00:17:11.361 --> 00:17:12.732
Oh, no, no, don't
worry about that.

305
00:17:12.734 --> 00:17:16.020
It's time for me to face
my responsibilities.

306
00:17:16.022 --> 00:17:16.978
I'll manage.

307
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.516
Yeah, I'll be fine.

308
00:17:19.518 --> 00:17:21.931
I know it doesn't
always seem like it,

309
00:17:21.933 --> 00:17:24.848
but I'm not as big
an idiot as I look.

310
00:17:30.217 --> 00:17:31.255
That's enough.

311
00:17:31.257 --> 00:17:32.503
Quite enough.

312
00:17:32.505 --> 00:17:34.336
If you really want
to take the throne,

313
00:17:34.338 --> 00:17:36.416
there's only one thing to do.

314
00:17:36.418 --> 00:17:39.496
We'll have a little
toast to celebrate, OK?

315
00:17:39.498 --> 00:17:41.037
A small toast.

316
00:17:41.039 --> 00:17:42.744
Shh, doggy, don't make a sound.

317
00:17:42.746 --> 00:17:46.240
I'll give you a taste of
one of my special drinks,

318
00:17:46.242 --> 00:17:48.322
and you can tell
me what you think.

319
00:17:48.324 --> 00:17:51.027
A toast to my coron...

320
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:52.776
Your coronation.

321
00:17:52.778 --> 00:17:53.941
To Foggyborough.

322
00:17:53.943 --> 00:17:55.025
Yes, there we go.

323
00:17:59.645 --> 00:18:03.431
Ah, my dear Roland, I've
got a story to tell you.

324
00:18:03.433 --> 00:18:06.594
I think it'll interest you.

325
00:18:06.596 --> 00:18:09.925
It's the story of a young
boy, a young boy who

326
00:18:09.927 --> 00:18:12.505
looked up to his king.

327
00:18:12.507 --> 00:18:14.046
Long live the King.

328
00:18:14.048 --> 00:18:16.334
Long live King Theobald.

329
00:18:16.336 --> 00:18:18.083
Long live the King.

330
00:18:18.085 --> 00:18:20.872
He dreamt of being
cheered by the crowd, just

331
00:18:20.874 --> 00:18:25.076
like him, to wear the
crowd, to sit on the throne.

332
00:18:27.743 --> 00:18:32.527
But his destiny was to learn
magic, like his godmother.

333
00:18:34.985 --> 00:18:37.855
The young boy didn't
want this as his destiny,

334
00:18:37.857 --> 00:18:40.435
so he altered it.

335
00:18:44.601 --> 00:18:48.097
He developed a potent poison
to get rid of the King.

336
00:18:50.844 --> 00:18:56.836
But there had to be a culprit,
so he accused his godmother.

337
00:18:56.838 --> 00:18:58.752
It was her.

338
00:18:58.754 --> 00:19:02.830
She fled and took refuge in the
scariest place in the kingdom,

339
00:19:02.832 --> 00:19:04.870
the Cursed Forest.

340
00:19:04.872 --> 00:19:07.659
Today, the only thing
standing between the boy

341
00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:11.488
and being crowned
king is the Prince.

342
00:19:24.103 --> 00:19:25.432
Hey, hey.

343
00:19:25.434 --> 00:19:28.638
Oh dear Roland, did it
go down the wrong way?

344
00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.844
Trouble digesting
the poison perhaps?

345
00:19:30.846 --> 00:19:31.968
Oh, what a pity.

346
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.339
The Prince struck down
by a mysterious illness

347
00:19:35.341 --> 00:19:38.003
on the day of his coronation.

348
00:19:38.005 --> 00:19:41.500
And I will remain in power.

349
00:19:41.502 --> 00:19:42.957
Wh... Nugget?

350
00:19:42.959 --> 00:19:44.246
Where are you, Nugget?

351
00:19:50.618 --> 00:19:53.196
Oh, well, I'd better
get going now.

352
00:19:53.198 --> 00:19:54.695
You're not going anywhere.

353
00:19:54.697 --> 00:19:57.233
I'm afraid you're in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

354
00:19:57.235 --> 00:19:58.941
Sorry, but I can't
leave any witnesses.

355
00:20:07.435 --> 00:20:09.056
Is he not dead yet?

356
00:20:15.093 --> 00:20:17.464
Did I mix up the ingredients?

357
00:20:17.466 --> 00:20:18.671
It doesn't matter.

358
00:20:18.673 --> 00:20:21.334
First, the urgent
and then the Prince.

359
00:20:21.336 --> 00:20:23.999
Pesky sprite, I know I
saw you come up here.

360
00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:30.867
I got to get in shape.

361
00:20:30.869 --> 00:20:31.869
What?

362
00:20:34.865 --> 00:20:35.865
Prince Roland?

363
00:20:43.024 --> 00:20:44.024
Prince?

364
00:20:47.894 --> 00:20:48.849
Oh, cockerel.

365
00:20:48.851 --> 00:20:50.056
You OK, Prince?

366
00:20:53.929 --> 00:20:56.050
Oh, the sprite.

367
00:20:56.052 --> 00:20:57.508
Crobar?

368
00:20:57.510 --> 00:20:59.921
Yes, it's the sprite, and
he's bewitched the Prince.

369
00:20:59.923 --> 00:21:01.420
Catch him, Crobar.

370
00:21:01.422 --> 00:21:02.378
Catch him.

371
00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.460
Come back here.

372
00:21:06.250 --> 00:21:08.121
Come here, you
pesky little sprite.

373
00:21:08.123 --> 00:21:11.494
I'll teach you to turn
our prince into a chicken.

374
00:21:11.496 --> 00:21:12.496
More stairs.

375
00:21:16.032 --> 00:21:17.278
No, wait, come back, Prince.

376
00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:18.280
It was a joke.

377
00:21:21.027 --> 00:21:23.359
That didn't go as well
as I'd hoped it would.

378
00:21:44.421 --> 00:21:45.335
Ow, ow, ow.

379
00:21:45.337 --> 00:21:46.500
Got a stitch in my side.

380
00:21:50.039 --> 00:21:50.704
Excuse me.

381
00:21:50.706 --> 00:21:51.287
Working.

382
00:21:51.289 --> 00:21:52.035
Coming through.

383
00:21:52.037 --> 00:21:53.076
Coming through.

384
00:21:53.078 --> 00:21:54.494
Like a stampede of Clydesdales.

385
00:21:58.531 --> 00:22:00.819
Looks like you've got a
big problem, Prince Roland.

386
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:04.690
And I think I'm the only
person who can help you.

387
00:22:04.692 --> 00:22:06.854
Luckily, I'm willing
to help you out.

388
00:22:06.856 --> 00:22:10.519
But in exchange I want the
treasure your father left.

389
00:22:13.058 --> 00:22:15.305
It's up to you.

390
00:22:15.307 --> 00:22:16.636
Good luck.

391
00:22:16.638 --> 00:22:18.218
Tore through here and
sent everything flying.

392
00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:19.426
It's quite insane.

393
00:22:19.428 --> 00:22:22.505
What is it?

394
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:30.747
Oh, get away, you beastly thing.

395
00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:34.992
So thought about my proposition?

396
00:22:34.994 --> 00:22:36.284
Tristain, thank goodness.

397
00:22:36.286 --> 00:22:37.989
The guard just
tore through here,

398
00:22:37.991 --> 00:22:39.406
sending my outfits flying.

399
00:22:39.408 --> 00:22:41.819
You do realize what a
scandal this could cause?

400
00:22:41.821 --> 00:22:43.651
You have to do
something, Tristain.

401
00:22:43.653 --> 00:22:46.357
That guard, the one who
manhandled my outfit.

402
00:22:46.359 --> 00:22:48.062
It's a deal.

403
00:22:48.064 --> 00:22:51.893
And then there was this beast
that was very ugly, hideous.

404
00:22:51.895 --> 00:22:52.850
A beast you say?

405
00:22:52.852 --> 00:22:54.015
Where did it go?

406
00:22:54.017 --> 00:22:56.679
It went that way.

407
00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:57.845
When Theobald was king...

408
00:22:57.847 --> 00:22:58.802
Yes, yes.

409
00:22:58.804 --> 00:23:00.084
This would never
have happened.

410
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:19.865
Tell me, milady, have
you seen a sprite go by?

411
00:23:19.867 --> 00:23:21.029
A sprite?

412
00:23:21.031 --> 00:23:21.821
No.

413
00:23:21.823 --> 00:23:22.653
And a chi-cat?

414
00:23:22.655 --> 00:23:23.237
A what?

415
00:23:23.239 --> 00:23:24.485
Yeah, you know.

416
00:23:24.487 --> 00:23:26.275
It's half cat, half chicken.

417
00:23:26.277 --> 00:23:27.358
So a chi-cat.

418
00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:28.357
Oh.

419
00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:29.521
Yes.

420
00:23:29.523 --> 00:23:30.687
And I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

421
00:23:30.689 --> 00:23:32.768
but the chi-cat
is Prince Roland.

422
00:23:32.770 --> 00:23:36.431
Oh, no, poor Prince Roland.

423
00:23:36.433 --> 00:23:39.262
And your furry friends,
have they seen the chi-cat?

424
00:23:39.264 --> 00:23:40.385
No, no, no.

425
00:23:40.387 --> 00:23:42.633
My friends haven't
seen it, Crobar.

426
00:23:42.635 --> 00:23:45.505
Wait, how do you know my name?

427
00:23:45.507 --> 00:23:49.710
Well, it's... it's... it's
because everyone knows Crobar.

428
00:23:49.712 --> 00:23:53.789
Everyone knows that you're the
bravest guard in Foggyborough.

429
00:23:53.791 --> 00:23:54.330
No!

430
00:23:54.332 --> 00:23:55.704
Yes.

431
00:23:55.706 --> 00:23:57.410
Among the nobles, everyone
says that you'll soon

432
00:23:57.412 --> 00:24:00.990
become a knight.

433
00:24:00.992 --> 00:24:01.992
Oh, the Prince!

434
00:24:04.988 --> 00:24:05.652
My treasure.

435
00:24:05.654 --> 00:24:07.775
Let the banquet begin.

436
00:24:35.374 --> 00:24:37.204
How am I going to find
him in all of this?

437
00:24:37.206 --> 00:24:38.619
I'll help you, Crobar.

438
00:24:38.621 --> 00:24:39.244
Really?

439
00:24:39.246 --> 00:24:40.160
You would do that?

440
00:24:40.162 --> 00:24:40.909
Of course.

441
00:24:40.911 --> 00:24:42.033
I am a princess.

442
00:24:42.035 --> 00:24:43.531
It's my job to help princes.

443
00:24:43.533 --> 00:24:44.862
Cockerel, is that true?

444
00:24:44.864 --> 00:24:46.195
You're a princess?

445
00:24:46.197 --> 00:24:48.484
Yes, yes, I sure am a princess.

446
00:24:48.486 --> 00:24:49.691
OK, look.

447
00:24:49.693 --> 00:24:51.173
You go that way, and
I'll go this way.

448
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:57.350
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
please give a round of applause

449
00:24:57.352 --> 00:25:01.679
for the irresistible,
the hilarious Jiggler.

450
00:25:03.346 --> 00:25:06.715
Please try to be funny.

451
00:25:06.717 --> 00:25:07.174
Hey.

452
00:25:07.176 --> 00:25:08.007
Hello.

453
00:25:08.009 --> 00:25:09.380
Do you want to laugh?

454
00:25:09.382 --> 00:25:10.587
I've got what you need.

455
00:25:10.589 --> 00:25:13.336
I have one joke with
two punch lines.

456
00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:18.664
Punches get it?

457
00:25:22.494 --> 00:25:23.993
Whoa, this is one tough crowd.

458
00:25:26.490 --> 00:25:28.153
More funny.

459
00:25:28.155 --> 00:25:29.193
More.

460
00:25:29.195 --> 00:25:32.982
So what is square and yellow?

461
00:25:32.984 --> 00:25:34.396
The sun.

462
00:25:34.398 --> 00:25:35.270
Yeah, I lied.

463
00:25:35.272 --> 00:25:37.477
The sun isn't square.

464
00:25:37.479 --> 00:25:40.182
Remind me again why I keep
this kid in the troupe.

465
00:25:40.184 --> 00:25:41.514
Because he's your nephew, Lugan.

466
00:25:41.516 --> 00:25:42.847
Oh, yeah, that's it.

467
00:25:42.849 --> 00:25:44.803
Anyway, at least he's
not using the puppet.

468
00:25:44.805 --> 00:25:47.800
Who would like to
pull my finger?

469
00:25:47.802 --> 00:25:48.802
You, madam?

470
00:25:52.131 --> 00:25:53.087
Give me that.

471
00:25:53.089 --> 00:25:54.168
Hey, hey, hey hey.

472
00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:56.042
Let go of that, madam.

473
00:25:56.044 --> 00:25:57.582
That's not him either.

474
00:25:57.584 --> 00:26:01.244
What is brown, soft,
and smells like poo?

475
00:26:03.161 --> 00:26:04.161
It's poo.

476
00:26:20.102 --> 00:26:21.059
Any luck, Crobar?

477
00:26:21.061 --> 00:26:22.098
I haven't found him.

478
00:26:25.889 --> 00:26:26.844
He can't be far.

479
00:26:26.846 --> 00:26:27.846
Keep looking.

480
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.582
How about this one?

481
00:26:37.584 --> 00:26:40.040
What do you call a knight
who's sure of himself?

482
00:26:40.042 --> 00:26:41.620
Sir-tainly.

483
00:26:41.622 --> 00:26:42.120
Get it?

484
00:26:42.122 --> 00:26:43.411
Certainly?

485
00:26:43.413 --> 00:26:44.326
Sir-tainly.

486
00:26:44.328 --> 00:26:46.158
So bad.

487
00:26:50.989 --> 00:26:53.192
Jiggler.

488
00:26:53.194 --> 00:26:54.775
Oh, hey there, Pil.

489
00:26:54.777 --> 00:26:56.148
Can you help me?

490
00:26:56.150 --> 00:27:00.519
Can you take out Mr. Destardo
to liven up the atmosphere?

491
00:27:00.521 --> 00:27:03.099
OK, friends, it's time
for me to introduce

492
00:27:03.101 --> 00:27:06.346
my partner, Mr. Destardo.

493
00:27:06.348 --> 00:27:08.969
Oh, no, please not the puppet.

494
00:27:08.971 --> 00:27:09.971
Hello!

495
00:27:12.300 --> 00:27:16.128
Play some music loud, very loud.

496
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.166
Did you hear about the
nobel who paid his taxes?

497
00:27:19.168 --> 00:27:20.000
No?

498
00:27:20.002 --> 00:27:21.002
Yeah, me neither.

499
00:27:24.038 --> 00:27:24.828
Don't like that?

500
00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:25.369
No?

501
00:27:25.371 --> 00:27:26.326
OK, moving on.

502
00:27:26.328 --> 00:27:27.950
How about a riddle then?

503
00:27:27.952 --> 00:27:28.952
Faster.

504
00:27:31.031 --> 00:27:34.193
How do you recognize a thief
who steals from the kingdom?

505
00:27:34.195 --> 00:27:36.358
He wears a crown on his head.

506
00:27:39.232 --> 00:27:40.187
Louder.

507
00:27:40.189 --> 00:27:41.189
Faster, louder.

508
00:27:44.102 --> 00:27:45.057
Let me through.

509
00:27:45.059 --> 00:27:46.139
Out of my way.

510
00:27:46.141 --> 00:27:47.680
Let me through.

511
00:27:47.682 --> 00:27:50.512
What's the difference between
a cushion and Lord Tristain?

512
00:27:54.342 --> 00:27:57.837
At least the cushion
belongs on the throne.

513
00:28:02.167 --> 00:28:03.372
Prince Roland.

514
00:28:03.374 --> 00:28:04.995
The chi-cat.

515
00:28:04.997 --> 00:28:05.997
My treasure.

516
00:28:09.868 --> 00:28:10.824
Move aside.

517
00:28:10.826 --> 00:28:12.363
I need to get by.

518
00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.068
Here kitty chi-cat.

519
00:28:19.358 --> 00:28:20.358
Move aside.

520
00:28:23.021 --> 00:28:24.476
Don't be scared.

521
00:28:24.478 --> 00:28:26.349
Come here, little prince.

522
00:28:26.351 --> 00:28:28.347
Don't be scared.

523
00:28:42.544 --> 00:28:44.165
Did you like that?

524
00:29:41.610 --> 00:29:43.439
They're very good, Nugget.

525
00:29:43.441 --> 00:29:45.187
A little too good.

526
00:29:45.189 --> 00:29:47.851
We're going to need some
help to eliminate the Prince.

527
00:29:50.767 --> 00:29:52.347
It's quiet, huh?

528
00:29:52.349 --> 00:29:55.427
What did you say?

529
00:29:55.429 --> 00:29:57.008
She said, it's quiet.

530
00:30:05.086 --> 00:30:06.458
Ha!

531
00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:10.495
We sure spoiled the
nobles' dinner, didn't we?

532
00:30:10.497 --> 00:30:11.661
Come on, Prince.

533
00:30:11.663 --> 00:30:13.159
Let me take you
back to the castle,

534
00:30:13.161 --> 00:30:14.616
and we'll go see Tristain.

535
00:30:14.618 --> 00:30:17.072
He'll know how to help you.

536
00:30:17.074 --> 00:30:19.070
Hey, what's gotten into him?

537
00:30:19.072 --> 00:30:20.859
I'll take care of him, Crobar.

538
00:30:20.861 --> 00:30:21.817
I'm a princess.

539
00:30:21.819 --> 00:30:23.773
I'm supposed to take
care of princes.

540
00:30:23.775 --> 00:30:26.978
You can go back to
chasing your sprite now.

541
00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.893
OK, goodbye.

542
00:30:28.895 --> 00:30:29.685
Oh, well.

543
00:30:29.687 --> 00:30:31.848
All right.

544
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:32.432
You see?

545
00:30:32.434 --> 00:30:33.431
I kept my word.

546
00:30:33.433 --> 00:30:34.596
I got you out of the castle.

547
00:30:34.598 --> 00:30:36.011
Now we have to make
you human again.

548
00:30:36.013 --> 00:30:38.051
We'll go see that sorceress
in the Cursed Forest.

549
00:30:38.053 --> 00:30:39.840
She must really hate Tristain.

550
00:30:39.842 --> 00:30:40.674
She'll help you.

551
00:30:40.676 --> 00:30:44.545
After that, I'll
get my treasure.

552
00:30:44.547 --> 00:30:46.501
Princess, where are you going?

553
00:30:46.503 --> 00:30:49.705
You're not going to
leave without us?

554
00:30:49.707 --> 00:30:50.664
Yes.

555
00:30:50.666 --> 00:30:52.620
But after everything
that's happened,

556
00:30:52.622 --> 00:30:56.865
Mr. Destardo and I are, well,
unemployed and looking for work

557
00:30:56.867 --> 00:30:57.657
right now.

558
00:30:57.659 --> 00:31:00.195
Could you maybe hire us?

559
00:31:00.197 --> 00:31:01.236
No.

560
00:31:01.238 --> 00:31:03.691
Are you sure, Princess?

561
00:31:03.693 --> 00:31:06.688
If you don't hire
us, Princess, I

562
00:31:06.690 --> 00:31:09.685
might have to have a word or
two with our friend Crobar

563
00:31:09.687 --> 00:31:12.308
about that pesky little
Foggyborough sprite

564
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.266
he's looking for.

565
00:31:13.268 --> 00:31:14.473
Oh, come on, Jiggler.

566
00:31:14.475 --> 00:31:15.679
You wouldn't turn
me in, would you?

567
00:31:15.681 --> 00:31:17.927
I wouldn't, but he would.

568
00:31:17.929 --> 00:31:19.051
Would you stop it.

569
00:31:19.053 --> 00:31:20.009
He's your puppet.

570
00:31:20.011 --> 00:31:21.591
Oh, no, he's my human.

571
00:31:21.593 --> 00:31:23.713
It's not the same.

572
00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.505
Fine.

573
00:31:24.507 --> 00:31:25.919
You can come with me.

574
00:31:25.921 --> 00:31:27.043
Where are we going?

575
00:31:27.045 --> 00:31:29.084
To find the sorceress
in the Cursed Forest.

576
00:31:29.086 --> 00:31:30.207
Woo-hoo!

577
00:31:30.209 --> 00:31:31.489
We're going to
the Cursed Forest.

578
00:31:33.623 --> 00:31:35.410
Where is that anyway?

579
00:31:35.412 --> 00:31:37.492
Well, I don't really know.

580
00:31:37.494 --> 00:31:40.405
It's due west, about
a day's journey.

581
00:31:40.407 --> 00:31:43.361
But you really
shouldn't go there.

582
00:31:43.363 --> 00:31:44.859
Why not?

583
00:31:44.861 --> 00:31:48.522
Because the Cursed Forest is
a forest that's been cursed.

584
00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:53.101
Yeah, we figured
something like that.

585
00:31:53.103 --> 00:31:54.558
You know the way?

586
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.180
Yes, I used to gather mushrooms
there when I was young.

587
00:31:57.182 --> 00:31:59.261
Back then, it
wasn't that cursed.

588
00:31:59.263 --> 00:32:02.009
But now it's much more cursed.

589
00:32:02.011 --> 00:32:03.216
Come on, Crobar.

590
00:32:03.218 --> 00:32:05.505
Are you really
afraid of a forest?

591
00:32:05.507 --> 00:32:07.752
Not just any forest, Princess.

592
00:32:07.754 --> 00:32:10.417
A cursed one.

593
00:32:10.419 --> 00:32:13.122
You want to become a
knight, right, Crobar?

594
00:32:13.124 --> 00:32:14.163
Yes.

595
00:32:14.165 --> 00:32:16.702
What if I helped you with that?

596
00:32:16.704 --> 00:32:17.909
Seriously?

597
00:32:17.911 --> 00:32:18.492
For sure.

598
00:32:18.494 --> 00:32:19.782
I'm a princess.

599
00:32:19.784 --> 00:32:20.573
It's my job.

600
00:32:20.575 --> 00:32:22.322
I can make anyone a knight.

601
00:32:22.324 --> 00:32:24.320
I just need to do that
thing with the sword

602
00:32:24.322 --> 00:32:25.360
on the shoulders.

603
00:32:25.362 --> 00:32:26.650
What's it called again?

604
00:32:26.652 --> 00:32:28.940
It's called dubbing.

605
00:32:28.942 --> 00:32:30.314
Oh, right, that's it.

606
00:32:30.316 --> 00:32:31.812
Take us to the Cursed
Forest, Crobar.

607
00:32:31.814 --> 00:32:33.601
Help us turn the Prince
back into a human.

608
00:32:33.603 --> 00:32:37.348
And, boom, I'll
dub you a knight.

609
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:39.346
That would be an
honor, Princess.

610
00:32:39.348 --> 00:32:40.262
That's great.

611
00:32:40.264 --> 00:32:41.264
Put it there.

612
00:32:46.674 --> 00:32:48.545
Onward to the Cursed Forest.

613
00:32:48.547 --> 00:32:51.833
My humor is at your
service, Princess.

614
00:32:51.835 --> 00:32:53.831
And my weapon will
protect you, Princess.

615
00:32:56.331 --> 00:32:57.912
Cockerel.

616
00:33:04.531 --> 00:33:06.610
Just think, that's
actually Prince Roland.

617
00:33:06.612 --> 00:33:09.859
Yeah, well, that's what you
get when nobles intermarry.

618
00:33:12.814 --> 00:33:14.395
Now, Jiggler, a little respect.

619
00:33:14.397 --> 00:33:16.850
Please remember the
princess is a noble as well.

620
00:33:16.852 --> 00:33:17.350
It wasn't me.

621
00:33:17.352 --> 00:33:18.352
It's him.

622
00:33:24.345 --> 00:33:25.716
Make way.

623
00:33:25.718 --> 00:33:28.422
Make way for Princess Pil.

624
00:33:28.424 --> 00:33:30.337
Step aside, good people.

625
00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:31.793
Make way.

626
00:33:31.795 --> 00:33:33.834
Crobar, do you have to do that?

627
00:33:33.836 --> 00:33:35.249
Yes, Princess.

628
00:33:35.251 --> 00:33:39.245
I have to make sure that you are
given the respect you are due.

629
00:33:39.247 --> 00:33:42.699
The respect that I'm due?

630
00:33:42.701 --> 00:33:43.490
Princess.

631
00:33:43.492 --> 00:33:45.155
Your respect, Your Highness.

632
00:33:45.157 --> 00:33:46.821
Greetings, Princess.

633
00:33:46.823 --> 00:33:48.361
Hello.

634
00:33:48.363 --> 00:33:49.360
Yoo-hoo.

635
00:33:49.362 --> 00:33:50.441
Wow.

636
00:33:50.443 --> 00:33:53.356
Wow, the Princess is beautiful.

637
00:33:53.358 --> 00:33:54.562
Your Highness.

638
00:33:54.564 --> 00:33:58.017
It's not that bad
being a princess.

639
00:33:58.019 --> 00:34:01.680
Looks like somebody's
getting a big head.

640
00:34:01.682 --> 00:34:04.635
Jiggler, your sock needs
to show some respect.

641
00:34:04.637 --> 00:34:06.301
Hey, did she call
me a sock again?

642
00:34:06.303 --> 00:34:07.342
Enough, Mr. Destardo.

643
00:34:07.344 --> 00:34:09.381
Now bow to the princess.

644
00:34:09.383 --> 00:34:11.920
No, I don't bow down to anybody.

645
00:34:11.922 --> 00:34:12.586
That's enough.

646
00:34:12.588 --> 00:34:13.460
Back in the pocket.

647
00:34:13.462 --> 00:34:14.376
No, not the pocket.

648
00:34:14.378 --> 00:34:15.958
Please not the pocket.

649
00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:16.957
It's dark in here.

650
00:34:16.959 --> 00:34:19.871
Let me out!

651
00:34:34.399 --> 00:34:35.855
Dash those worries.

652
00:34:35.857 --> 00:34:36.937
Sing out loud.

653
00:34:36.939 --> 00:34:37.894
The cat is a chicken.

654
00:34:37.896 --> 00:34:39.101
The chicken a cat.

655
00:34:39.103 --> 00:34:40.849
Together we're strong,
and nothing will stop us.

656
00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:42.017
Cockerel, beware.

657
00:34:44.847 --> 00:34:45.679
Your Highness.

658
00:34:45.681 --> 00:34:46.343
Princess.

659
00:34:46.345 --> 00:34:47.345
Prince...

660
00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:53.299
Huh?

661
00:35:12.195 --> 00:35:13.358
Dash those worries.

662
00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.482
Sing out loud.

663
00:35:14.484 --> 00:35:15.439
The cat is a chicken.

664
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:16.773
The chicken a cat.

665
00:35:16.775 --> 00:35:18.229
Together we're strong,
and nothing can stop us.

666
00:35:18.231 --> 00:35:20.227
Cockerel, beware.

667
00:35:43.123 --> 00:35:43.995
Sing it.

668
00:35:43.997 --> 00:35:44.745
Sing it.

669
00:35:44.747 --> 00:35:45.451
Sing a melody.

670
00:35:45.453 --> 00:35:46.408
The catch is a chicken.

671
00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.658
The chicken a cat.

672
00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:49.405
Raise your head, and
keep moving forward.

673
00:35:49.407 --> 00:35:51.403
Nothing can stop us now.

674
00:36:15.007 --> 00:36:16.007
Prince Roland!

675
00:36:24.331 --> 00:36:27.409
Crobar, I'm hungry.

676
00:36:27.411 --> 00:36:29.365
Yes, Princess, I'll
be right there.

677
00:36:32.281 --> 00:36:34.402
Oh, it's too hot, Crobar.

678
00:36:34.404 --> 00:36:35.529
Oh, yes, sorry.

679
00:36:42.979 --> 00:36:44.350
Now it's too cold.

680
00:36:44.352 --> 00:36:46.141
A thousand pardons, Princess.

681
00:36:46.143 --> 00:36:47.389
I'll get you another bowl.

682
00:36:47.391 --> 00:36:50.178
Fetch them for my
weasels as well, Crobar.

683
00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:52.342
Yes, yes.

684
00:36:52.344 --> 00:36:54.091
There you are.

685
00:36:54.093 --> 00:36:55.341
Enjoy your meal, Princess.

686
00:36:59.879 --> 00:37:03.331
Poor dear, sleeping outside
when you're a princess.

687
00:37:03.333 --> 00:37:04.542
So sad.

688
00:37:20.026 --> 00:37:23.396
You have promised to make
me a knight, Princess.

689
00:37:23.398 --> 00:37:25.184
That has been my dream.

690
00:37:25.186 --> 00:37:28.349
I wanted to thank you somehow,
so I made this modest gift

691
00:37:28.351 --> 00:37:29.351
for you.

692
00:37:44.043 --> 00:37:45.831
Hey, watch it, Princess.

693
00:37:45.833 --> 00:37:48.663
You're becoming as
snobby as a real noble.

694
00:38:02.983 --> 00:38:03.983
Crobar?

695
00:38:06.438 --> 00:38:08.017
That's very pretty.

696
00:38:08.019 --> 00:38:10.056
Thank you.

697
00:38:10.058 --> 00:38:11.557
Glad to be of service, Princess.

698
00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:20.985
Pardon?

699
00:39:25.359 --> 00:39:28.561
I don't understand
what you're saying.

700
00:39:28.563 --> 00:39:30.893
What are you doing here?

701
00:39:30.895 --> 00:39:31.932
Ahh.

702
00:39:31.934 --> 00:39:34.390
I need to make some
people disappear,

703
00:39:34.392 --> 00:39:36.014
and I'll pay you for it.

704
00:39:41.966 --> 00:39:44.420
Ah, yes.

705
00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:47.501
Eliminating people
for a little money.

706
00:39:47.503 --> 00:39:49.914
We can do that for
sure, but it's a shame.

707
00:39:49.916 --> 00:39:50.456
Really?

708
00:39:50.458 --> 00:39:51.788
Why's that?

709
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:56.159
Because right now we've
got a subscription plan!

710
00:39:56.161 --> 00:39:57.741
Subscription plan?

711
00:39:57.743 --> 00:40:01.154
Yes, we offer quality
service, professionalism.

712
00:40:01.156 --> 00:40:02.652
We adapt to each client.

713
00:40:02.654 --> 00:40:05.359
Satisfaction guaranteed.

714
00:40:05.361 --> 00:40:08.521
For example, with our
special ambassador plus,

715
00:40:08.523 --> 00:40:10.644
you can have unlimited
assassinations

716
00:40:10.646 --> 00:40:15.015
on whoever you please,
with a bonus of torture.

717
00:40:15.017 --> 00:40:16.846
We

718
00:40:16.848 --> 00:40:18.720
We plunder.

719
00:40:18.722 --> 00:40:19.719
We burn.

720
00:40:19.721 --> 00:40:21.884
And we hurt little kitty cats.

721
00:40:25.007 --> 00:40:27.627
Oh, no, we stopped doing that.

722
00:40:27.629 --> 00:40:28.501
Sorry.

723
00:40:28.503 --> 00:40:29.709
All right, then.

724
00:40:29.711 --> 00:40:31.373
I guess I'll take
the ambassador plus.

725
00:40:31.375 --> 00:40:32.456
Yeah!

726
00:40:32.458 --> 00:40:34.995
Ambassador plus,
ambassador plus.

727
00:40:34.997 --> 00:40:36.244
Congratulations.

728
00:40:36.246 --> 00:40:38.658
However, the ambassador
plus subscription,

729
00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:42.155
as you can imagine,
costs a little extra.

730
00:40:42.157 --> 00:40:43.655
Money is not a problem.

731
00:40:46.901 --> 00:40:49.273
Now, the four individuals
that must disappear.

732
00:40:49.275 --> 00:40:50.688
Four?

733
00:40:50.690 --> 00:40:53.186
I'm afraid four is too many
for the ambassador plus.

734
00:40:53.188 --> 00:40:56.099
You're going to need to sign
up for the premium plan.

735
00:40:56.101 --> 00:40:57.972
Yeah, premium plan.

736
00:40:57.974 --> 00:40:59.762
Premium plan.

737
00:40:59.764 --> 00:41:00.469
Oh, all right.

738
00:41:00.471 --> 00:41:02.509
I'll take the pre...

739
00:41:02.511 --> 00:41:05.506
Are you trying to play
me for a fool here?

740
00:41:05.508 --> 00:41:07.005
Yes, I guess I am.

741
00:41:07.007 --> 00:41:08.461
Well, at least I tried.

742
00:41:08.463 --> 00:41:11.001
So who are the four individuals
you want to disappear?

743
00:41:11.003 --> 00:41:15.996
These guards... will you
let me finish my sentence?

744
00:41:15.998 --> 00:41:17.994
What I was going to
say was, these guards

745
00:41:17.996 --> 00:41:19.824
will show you the
way they're headed.

746
00:41:19.826 --> 00:41:22.075
But now they won't be
able to do anything.

747
00:41:25.239 --> 00:41:27.692
Come on, follow me.

748
00:41:27.694 --> 00:41:29.940
I'm really tired of this lot.

749
00:41:43.345 --> 00:41:46.008
Be careful because from
here on in it's cursed.

750
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:48.671
And over there is
really, really cursed.

751
00:41:48.673 --> 00:41:50.919
This isn't too bad, but
it's cursed just the same.

752
00:41:50.921 --> 00:41:52.334
So be careful.

753
00:41:52.336 --> 00:41:53.167
Yoo-hoo.

754
00:41:53.169 --> 00:41:54.915
Sorceress, yoo-hoo.

755
00:41:54.917 --> 00:41:56.663
Where are you?

756
00:41:56.665 --> 00:41:59.202
For 15 years, she's been
living here all alone?

757
00:41:59.204 --> 00:42:00.326
Maybe she's gone a little...

758
00:42:00.328 --> 00:42:01.492
A little what?

759
00:42:01.494 --> 00:42:03.490
A little nutso.

760
00:42:03.492 --> 00:42:06.653
And this coming from a
guy who talks to a sock.

761
00:42:06.655 --> 00:42:09.650
Look, we'll have a better chance
of finding her if we split up.

762
00:42:09.652 --> 00:42:11.772
Everybody choose a path to take.

763
00:42:11.774 --> 00:42:12.774
Good luck.

764
00:42:15.022 --> 00:42:19.224
OK, splitting up in
the Cursed Forest.

765
00:42:19.226 --> 00:42:21.180
Good idea.

766
00:42:21.182 --> 00:42:22.512
All right, be brave.

767
00:42:22.514 --> 00:42:24.635
You won't let some
Cursed Forest scare us.

768
00:42:24.637 --> 00:42:25.637
No sir.

769
00:42:29.008 --> 00:42:30.796
It's just a forest
that's a bit cursed.

770
00:42:36.334 --> 00:42:39.329
Madam sorceress, yoo-hoo.

771
00:42:39.331 --> 00:42:41.659
Hey, Jiggler.

772
00:42:41.661 --> 00:42:43.366
You want to quit
jiggling so much?

773
00:42:43.368 --> 00:42:45.323
I think I might have
heard something.

774
00:42:59.477 --> 00:43:02.015
Oh, cockerel.

775
00:43:03.932 --> 00:43:04.932
Hmm?

776
00:43:14.087 --> 00:43:15.087
Huh?

777
00:43:17.834 --> 00:43:19.164
Crobar.

778
00:43:19.166 --> 00:43:20.329
Jiggler.

779
00:43:20.331 --> 00:43:21.495
Over here.

780
00:43:21.497 --> 00:43:22.827
Did you find something?

781
00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:28.321
Yes, look over here.

782
00:43:28.323 --> 00:43:29.945
The sorceress left
her footprints.

783
00:43:29.947 --> 00:43:34.190
But they stop right here,
as if she flew away.

784
00:43:39.521 --> 00:43:41.433
Did you hear that?

785
00:43:41.435 --> 00:43:44.389
Yes, that sounds close.

786
00:43:44.391 --> 00:43:49.425
At this very moment, she
could be right behind us.

787
00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:52.131
Let's all turn around
at the same time.

788
00:43:52.133 --> 00:43:53.088
Yeah, all right.

789
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:53.880
We'll turn on 3.

790
00:43:53.882 --> 00:43:54.837
Ready?

791
00:43:54.839 --> 00:43:56.835
1.

792
00:43:56.837 --> 00:43:58.001
2.

793
00:43:58.003 --> 00:44:00.831
2 and 1/2.

794
00:44:00.833 --> 00:44:03.328
3.

795
00:44:03.330 --> 00:44:04.536
I guess she's not here.

796
00:44:09.449 --> 00:44:11.527
You don't belong in here.

797
00:44:11.529 --> 00:44:13.151
Get out right now.

798
00:44:13.153 --> 00:44:16.817
But we need your help to save
the prince of Foggyborough.

799
00:44:20.896 --> 00:44:23.350
I don't care about
Foggyborough, and I

800
00:44:23.352 --> 00:44:25.181
don't care about the Prince.

801
00:44:25.183 --> 00:44:28.303
Now get out of here.

802
00:44:32.384 --> 00:44:34.005
Wait, what are you
doing, Princess?

803
00:45:09.681 --> 00:45:10.681
Huh?

804
00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:17.462
It's the story of a young boy.

805
00:45:17.464 --> 00:45:21.333
He developed a potent poison
to get rid of the King,

806
00:45:21.335 --> 00:45:23.914
so he accused his godmother.

807
00:45:23.916 --> 00:45:25.121
It was her!

808
00:45:35.655 --> 00:45:38.525
You're a stubborn one.

809
00:45:38.527 --> 00:45:40.897
I know you weren't the
one who poisoned Theobald.

810
00:45:40.899 --> 00:45:43.311
I know that you
are a good person.

811
00:45:43.313 --> 00:45:45.933
You will help us save
the Prince, right?

812
00:45:45.935 --> 00:45:46.849
I've changed.

813
00:45:46.851 --> 00:45:48.681
You don't know what
it's like to be

814
00:45:48.683 --> 00:45:52.843
hunted, to live alone like an
animal to avoid being captured.

815
00:45:52.845 --> 00:45:56.839
Yes, I know exactly
what it's like.

816
00:45:56.841 --> 00:45:59.504
But if you help me
save the Prince,

817
00:45:59.506 --> 00:46:01.752
that will all change for me.

818
00:46:15.781 --> 00:46:16.487
It's fine.

819
00:46:16.489 --> 00:46:17.111
She's going to help us.

820
00:46:17.113 --> 00:46:18.113
Yeah?

821
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:25.269
We must act fast, or the Prince
will stay like this forever.

822
00:46:27.977 --> 00:46:31.264
To prepare the antidote,
I'll need one very

823
00:46:31.266 --> 00:46:33.262
special ingredient.

824
00:46:33.264 --> 00:46:35.134
And what would that be?

825
00:46:35.136 --> 00:46:38.048
The dung from a unicorn.

826
00:46:38.050 --> 00:46:39.796
Do unicorns really poo?

827
00:46:39.798 --> 00:46:40.713
Yes.

828
00:46:40.715 --> 00:46:42.835
And there's only
one place on Earth

829
00:46:42.837 --> 00:46:45.374
you can find the
dung of a unicorn,

830
00:46:45.376 --> 00:46:48.746
in the Glen of the Beast.

831
00:46:48.748 --> 00:46:49.869
A beast?

832
00:46:49.871 --> 00:46:51.327
Like a werewolf?

833
00:46:51.329 --> 00:46:53.408
No.

834
00:46:53.410 --> 00:46:58.028
This beast is much
worse than a werewolf.

835
00:46:58.030 --> 00:47:02.441
You will take the mountain
path until you reach the Glen.

836
00:47:02.443 --> 00:47:04.647
When you get there,
don't linger.

837
00:47:04.649 --> 00:47:07.269
Pick up the poo, and
get out of there.

838
00:47:07.271 --> 00:47:11.889
Whatever you do, stay
out of the shade.

839
00:47:11.891 --> 00:47:12.721
Hold on.

840
00:47:12.723 --> 00:47:14.719
Is this going to be dangerous?

841
00:47:14.721 --> 00:47:17.301
You came into the Cursed
Forest, looking for a sorceress

842
00:47:17.303 --> 00:47:20.339
to break the spell that turned
the Prince into a chi-cat.

843
00:47:20.341 --> 00:47:22.172
Yes, it's going to be dangerous.

844
00:47:22.174 --> 00:47:23.794
What did you expect?

845
00:47:23.796 --> 00:47:25.917
Well, if it's dangerous, we'd
better leave the Prince here,

846
00:47:25.919 --> 00:47:26.749
right?

847
00:47:26.751 --> 00:47:29.746
Yes, he'll be safe here with me.

848
00:47:29.748 --> 00:47:30.454
Oh, yeah?

849
00:47:30.456 --> 00:47:31.786
See that, Jiggler?

850
00:47:31.788 --> 00:47:35.865
Turns out the sorceress
isn't nutso after all.

851
00:47:35.867 --> 00:47:37.447
Yum, yum.

852
00:47:37.449 --> 00:47:38.532
Yum, yum, yum.

853
00:47:44.858 --> 00:47:46.313
Come on, Nugget.

854
00:47:46.315 --> 00:47:47.437
Find them.

855
00:48:07.835 --> 00:48:08.957
There you go.

856
00:48:08.959 --> 00:48:10.830
At least with this,
you won't catch a cold.

857
00:48:10.832 --> 00:48:11.832
Thanks, Crobar.

858
00:48:15.869 --> 00:48:17.282
That's funny.

859
00:48:17.284 --> 00:48:20.778
With that hood on, she reminds
me of the Foggyborough sprite.

860
00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.611
Oh, yeah, you're right, Crobar.

861
00:48:22.613 --> 00:48:23.859
Go on, catch her.

862
00:48:23.861 --> 00:48:24.858
Catch her.

863
00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.315
No, no, no, no,
it's a joke, Crobar.

864
00:48:26.317 --> 00:48:27.189
He's joking.

865
00:48:27.191 --> 00:48:28.105
Yeah, I know.

866
00:48:28.107 --> 00:48:30.519
I get it.

867
00:49:12.104 --> 00:49:13.143
This is it.

868
00:49:13.145 --> 00:49:14.808
We're in the Beast's territory.

869
00:49:27.797 --> 00:49:29.085
The Beast!

870
00:49:29.087 --> 00:49:30.667
It's got me!

871
00:49:30.669 --> 00:49:31.333
Run!

872
00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:32.499
Run!

873
00:49:32.501 --> 00:49:34.080
Hey, Shee Shee, that's enough.

874
00:49:34.082 --> 00:49:35.329
Stop bothering these people.

875
00:49:35.331 --> 00:49:36.328
Come here.

876
00:49:36.330 --> 00:49:37.826
Oh, don't be afraid.

877
00:49:37.828 --> 00:49:42.156
She's gentle, but sometimes
she gets a little hungry.

878
00:49:42.158 --> 00:49:43.862
Oh, no, not my mince tart.

879
00:49:43.864 --> 00:49:45.486
That was my last one.

880
00:49:45.488 --> 00:49:49.149
Well, Shee Shee sure does
love those mince tarts.

881
00:49:49.151 --> 00:49:51.105
So what brings you
up around here?

882
00:49:51.107 --> 00:49:53.477
We're looking for a unicorn.

883
00:49:53.479 --> 00:49:54.851
You're too funny, you.

884
00:49:54.853 --> 00:49:57.057
There's no such
thing as unicorns.

885
00:49:57.059 --> 00:49:58.181
Hey, look, Crobar.

886
00:49:58.183 --> 00:50:01.220
Over there.

887
00:50:01.222 --> 00:50:02.510
We found it.

888
00:50:02.512 --> 00:50:07.006
Only thing is it's in the shade.

889
00:50:07.008 --> 00:50:08.670
I'll go, Princess.

890
00:50:08.672 --> 00:50:10.960
You sure?

891
00:50:10.962 --> 00:50:14.290
Yes, it's my duty.

892
00:50:14.292 --> 00:50:15.375
Be careful, Crobar.

893
00:50:23.616 --> 00:50:25.154
Unicorn.

894
00:50:25.156 --> 00:50:27.069
I come here every
day with my sheep.

895
00:50:27.071 --> 00:50:30.191
If there was a unicorn around,
I'm sure we'd have seen it.

896
00:50:30.193 --> 00:50:31.193
Right, Shee Shee?

897
00:50:40.183 --> 00:50:41.847
It's clouding over, cockerel.

898
00:50:44.846 --> 00:50:47.382
We don't have seasons
anymore, I'm telling you.

899
00:50:52.338 --> 00:50:53.085
What is it?

900
00:50:53.087 --> 00:50:53.917
What's wrong?

901
00:50:53.919 --> 00:50:54.875
What's the matter?

902
00:50:54.877 --> 00:50:56.832
Why are you looking
at me like that?

903
00:51:07.198 --> 00:51:08.902
Pil, behind you!

904
00:51:15.855 --> 00:51:16.936
Hey, there we go.

905
00:51:16.938 --> 00:51:18.934
Didn't turn out to be
that hard after all.

906
00:51:25.845 --> 00:51:26.845
Hurry!

907
00:51:31.215 --> 00:51:32.461
Come on, run, Jiggler!

908
00:51:32.463 --> 00:51:35.209
Run for your life!

909
00:51:35.211 --> 00:51:36.374
You can do this.

910
00:51:36.376 --> 00:51:37.456
Yes, yes, that's it.

911
00:51:37.458 --> 00:51:39.996
You're really going fast now.

912
00:51:39.998 --> 00:51:42.244
Are you flying?

913
00:51:42.246 --> 00:51:44.824
Oh, never mind, Jiggler.

914
00:51:48.782 --> 00:51:49.782
Jiggler!

915
00:51:59.104 --> 00:52:01.183
Princess, go find shelter.

916
00:52:01.185 --> 00:52:02.890
I'll take care of the Beast.

917
00:52:07.138 --> 00:52:08.509
I'll get you out
of there, Jiggler.

918
00:52:08.511 --> 00:52:10.091
Thanks, Crobar.

919
00:52:23.705 --> 00:52:27.032
Hey, you're hitting
Jiggler, you big oaf.

920
00:52:27.034 --> 00:52:28.864
Cockerel.

921
00:52:28.866 --> 00:52:30.320
That's all right.

922
00:52:35.484 --> 00:52:38.063
Oh cockerel, I dropped my poo.

923
00:52:38.065 --> 00:52:40.852
I think I did too.

924
00:52:47.514 --> 00:52:51.175
Crobar, you have proven that
you deserve to be a knight.

925
00:52:53.424 --> 00:52:56.503
Keep the unicorn busy
while we grab the bag.

926
00:52:56.505 --> 00:52:57.876
Yeah, but how?

927
00:52:57.878 --> 00:52:58.878
Here, catch.

928
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:09.074
At your service, Princess.

929
00:53:13.987 --> 00:53:14.943
Come on, Shee Shee.

930
00:53:14.945 --> 00:53:16.316
Catch that mince tart.

931
00:53:16.318 --> 00:53:17.318
Get it.

932
00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:50.990
Yes.

933
00:53:50.992 --> 00:53:51.906
It's OK, Crobar.

934
00:53:51.908 --> 00:53:52.908
We got the bag.

935
00:54:09.181 --> 00:54:11.136
Come on, Crobar.

936
00:54:27.997 --> 00:54:29.159
Hang on tight.

937
00:54:42.273 --> 00:54:43.521
Come back.

938
00:54:43.523 --> 00:54:45.060
I told you there's
nothing to be scared of.

939
00:54:45.062 --> 00:54:48.724
If there's a unicorn here, I
would have seen it for sure.

940
00:54:48.726 --> 00:54:49.598
Oh, darn it.

941
00:54:49.600 --> 00:54:51.056
I split my pants again.

942
00:55:15.115 --> 00:55:15.822
I don't believe it.

943
00:55:15.824 --> 00:55:17.070
We did it.

944
00:55:17.072 --> 00:55:18.735
We're going to save the
Prince and complete our quest.

945
00:55:18.737 --> 00:55:21.191
And I'm going to
become a knight.

946
00:55:21.193 --> 00:55:23.022
Sir Crobar the Knight.

947
00:55:23.024 --> 00:55:24.896
Sir Crobar the Knight.

948
00:55:24.898 --> 00:55:27.227
Don't you think you
should tell him the truth?

949
00:55:27.229 --> 00:55:30.098
Sir Crobar the Knight.

950
00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:31.390
Well, you coming?

951
00:55:31.392 --> 00:55:33.554
Sir Crobar the Knight.

952
00:55:33.556 --> 00:55:34.930
Yeah, we're coming, Crobar.

953
00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:02.066
Yeah, that's dead.

954
00:56:07.605 --> 00:56:10.808
Flower of hellboar,
slime of a slug,

955
00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:14.347
venom from a viper, and
dung from a unicorn.

956
00:56:18.427 --> 00:56:20.007
Sir Crobar the Knight.

957
00:56:20.009 --> 00:56:22.005
Sir Crobar the Knight.

958
00:56:31.498 --> 00:56:32.411
There we are.

959
00:56:32.413 --> 00:56:34.119
The antidote is ready.

960
00:56:34.121 --> 00:56:35.159
Drink this.

961
00:56:55.183 --> 00:56:55.887
Hey.

962
00:56:55.889 --> 00:56:57.428
It worked.

963
00:56:57.430 --> 00:56:59.967
Yeah, but he's buck naked.

964
00:56:59.969 --> 00:57:01.008
He needs undies.

965
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:02.340
Undies!

966
00:57:02.342 --> 00:57:04.172
Undies, undies,
undies, undies, undies.

967
00:57:04.174 --> 00:57:05.046
Here.

968
00:57:05.048 --> 00:57:05.836
It's all I could find.

969
00:57:05.838 --> 00:57:06.838
Thanks.

970
00:57:09.002 --> 00:57:10.166
There we go.

971
00:57:10.168 --> 00:57:13.038
Looks good, huh?

972
00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:14.120
Mission accomplished.

973
00:57:14.122 --> 00:57:15.826
We saved the Prince.

974
00:57:20.615 --> 00:57:23.360
I swear to honor and serve
you till I die and fight

975
00:57:23.362 --> 00:57:25.400
for the cause of justice.

976
00:57:25.402 --> 00:57:27.855
I am ready to become
your loyal knight.

977
00:57:47.837 --> 00:57:51.000
You can't become
a knight, Crobar.

978
00:57:51.002 --> 00:57:53.123
Because I'm not a real princess.

979
00:57:53.125 --> 00:57:58.824
I stole this dress when you were
chasing me through the castle.

980
00:57:58.826 --> 00:58:00.448
Huh?

981
00:58:00.450 --> 00:58:02.988
Wait, so you're the sprite?

982
00:58:02.990 --> 00:58:04.154
Is that it?

983
00:58:04.156 --> 00:58:07.525
Yeah, I am.

984
00:58:07.527 --> 00:58:09.314
You lied to me.

985
00:58:09.316 --> 00:58:11.396
You manipulated me.

986
00:58:11.398 --> 00:58:14.725
Why would you do all that?

987
00:58:14.727 --> 00:58:18.472
To get to the treasure
that Theobald stashed away.

988
00:58:18.474 --> 00:58:20.428
And I thought you
were so honorable.

989
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:22.510
In fact, you only want the gold.

990
00:58:22.512 --> 00:58:23.967
That's the only
thing you care about.

991
00:58:23.969 --> 00:58:27.006
It's time the nobles learn
to share their wealth.

992
00:58:27.008 --> 00:58:28.254
I didn't do it for pleasure.

993
00:58:28.256 --> 00:58:30.086
I did it to survive.

994
00:58:30.088 --> 00:58:33.041
You think it's easy, being an
orphan, living on the street.

995
00:58:33.043 --> 00:58:34.206
Doesn't matter.

996
00:58:34.208 --> 00:58:36.122
That's no excuse
for being dishonest.

997
00:58:36.124 --> 00:58:37.495
I really trusted you.

998
00:58:37.497 --> 00:58:41.199
I thought you respected me.

999
00:58:41.201 --> 00:58:42.406
I'm an idiot.

1000
00:58:42.408 --> 00:58:43.322
An idiot.

1001
00:58:43.324 --> 00:58:44.114
An idiot.

1002
00:58:44.116 --> 00:58:45.694
I'm an idiot.

1003
00:58:45.696 --> 00:58:46.319
Crobar.

1004
00:58:46.321 --> 00:58:47.321
No, wait.

1005
00:58:49.610 --> 00:58:51.481
Go talk to him, Pil.

1006
00:58:51.483 --> 00:58:54.062
It's never too late to
ask for forgiveness.

1007
00:58:58.018 --> 00:58:59.018
Crobar.

1008
00:59:11.629 --> 00:59:14.916
Tristain, it's been a long time.

1009
00:59:14.918 --> 00:59:17.996
My dear godmother,
I wish you no harm.

1010
00:59:17.998 --> 00:59:19.328
I just came to get the Prince.

1011
00:59:19.330 --> 00:59:20.993
You're too late, Tristain.

1012
00:59:20.995 --> 00:59:23.824
I will not let you hurt him.

1013
00:59:23.826 --> 00:59:26.946
I don't think you fully
understand the situation.

1014
00:59:38.352 --> 00:59:40.016
We're going to burn everything.

1015
00:59:40.018 --> 00:59:41.306
Yes, burn everything.

1016
00:59:41.308 --> 00:59:42.305
Aim.

1017
00:59:42.307 --> 00:59:43.307
Fire.

1018
00:59:49.758 --> 00:59:52.545
And you, Crobar.

1019
00:59:52.547 --> 00:59:55.375
I knew you were a
good-for-nothing but not

1020
00:59:55.377 --> 00:59:57.041
a traitor.

1021
00:59:57.043 --> 00:59:58.043
No, Crobar!

1022
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:10.902
Pil!

1023
01:00:20.852 --> 01:00:22.848
Pil!

1024
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.172
Tristain!

1025
01:00:44.661 --> 01:00:45.408
No, no.

1026
01:00:45.410 --> 01:00:46.241
Leave me alone.

1027
01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:47.240
Pil!

1028
01:00:47.242 --> 01:00:49.196
Pil!

1029
01:01:06.389 --> 01:01:08.427
Lord Tristain has returned.

1030
01:01:19.335 --> 01:01:21.831
Oh, cockerel, I'm leaving.

1031
01:01:21.833 --> 01:01:23.162
What's happened?

1032
01:01:28.117 --> 01:01:33.110
People of Foggyborough, I have
some very sad news to announce.

1033
01:01:33.112 --> 01:01:36.274
The horrible sorceress,
who, as you all remember,

1034
01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:39.021
poisoned our good
King Theobald, is back

1035
01:01:39.023 --> 01:01:43.850
and kidnapped our prince,
with her foul accomplices.

1036
01:01:43.852 --> 01:01:46.556
She dragged Prince Roland
into the Cursed Forest

1037
01:01:46.558 --> 01:01:48.969
and then threw
him into an abyss.

1038
01:01:48.971 --> 01:01:50.967
Oh, my poor darling.

1039
01:01:50.969 --> 01:01:53.715
And now he's dead.

1040
01:01:53.717 --> 01:01:54.963
Dead.

1041
01:01:54.965 --> 01:01:57.170
Dead, dead, dead.

1042
01:01:59.753 --> 01:02:01.416
Duchess.

1043
01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:03.414
These criminals
shall be executed.

1044
01:02:03.416 --> 01:02:05.828
After that, we'll proceed
with my coronation.

1045
01:02:05.830 --> 01:02:07.243
Oh, yes.

1046
01:02:07.245 --> 01:02:08.659
Since the Prince can no longer
take his place on the throne,

1047
01:02:08.661 --> 01:02:10.823
I gladly volunteer
to be your new king.

1048
01:02:10.825 --> 01:02:12.821
It's what Roland
would have wanted.

1049
01:02:44.999 --> 01:02:47.328
Crobar.

1050
01:02:47.330 --> 01:02:48.330
Jiggler.

1051
01:02:59.984 --> 01:03:01.731
Roland?

1052
01:03:01.733 --> 01:03:07.058
Pil, I don't want to impose, but
could you please help me again.

1053
01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:08.060
Hold on.

1054
01:03:41.443 --> 01:03:43.439
We've got to get to
Foggyborough before Tristain

1055
01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:44.441
hurts our friends.

1056
01:03:49.518 --> 01:03:51.139
You kept your promise, Pil.

1057
01:03:51.141 --> 01:03:52.680
You saved my life.

1058
01:03:52.682 --> 01:03:54.678
You've earned my
father's treasure.

1059
01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:57.300
Look, I don't care about
your father's treasure.

1060
01:03:57.302 --> 01:03:58.257
Really?

1061
01:03:58.259 --> 01:03:59.506
OK.

1062
01:03:59.508 --> 01:04:01.046
Well, that works out
well because truth

1063
01:04:01.048 --> 01:04:04.126
is, I don't know where it is.

1064
01:04:04.128 --> 01:04:06.249
But I thought your
aunt told you?

1065
01:04:06.251 --> 01:04:07.456
Not really.

1066
01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:09.204
She just said, in
order to find it,

1067
01:04:09.206 --> 01:04:11.202
my father had left
a riddle to solve.

1068
01:04:11.204 --> 01:04:13.824
To build... what was it?

1069
01:04:13.826 --> 01:04:16.821
"To build a kingdom, one must
find where nobility sits."

1070
01:04:16.823 --> 01:04:17.987
Oh, you know it?

1071
01:04:17.989 --> 01:04:19.569
It's the town's motto, Roland.

1072
01:04:19.571 --> 01:04:22.316
Everyone knows it.

1073
01:04:22.318 --> 01:04:24.439
I knew it sounded familiar.

1074
01:04:24.441 --> 01:04:25.480
OK, hold on, Roland.

1075
01:04:25.482 --> 01:04:27.020
This might get bumpy.

1076
01:04:27.022 --> 01:04:29.351
Woo-hoo!

1077
01:04:29.353 --> 01:04:30.350
Watch out.

1078
01:04:30.352 --> 01:04:32.348
Out of the way.

1079
01:04:32.350 --> 01:04:35.345
Excuse us.

1080
01:04:35.347 --> 01:04:38.093
Look, the Prince in his undies.

1081
01:04:38.095 --> 01:04:39.424
What did you say?

1082
01:04:39.426 --> 01:04:42.879
She said, it's the
Prince in his underwear.

1083
01:04:47.834 --> 01:04:48.582
Keep going, Pil.

1084
01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.996
I'll meet you there.

1085
01:05:01.196 --> 01:05:04.690
All right, let's get started.

1086
01:05:04.692 --> 01:05:05.692
Stop!

1087
01:05:09.313 --> 01:05:10.268
That's Pil.

1088
01:05:10.270 --> 01:05:11.267
She's alive.

1089
01:05:11.269 --> 01:05:12.225
Woo-hoo!

1090
01:05:12.227 --> 01:05:14.181
She's alive.

1091
01:05:14.183 --> 01:05:15.097
Huh?

1092
01:05:15.099 --> 01:05:16.304
I thought she was dead.

1093
01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:34.040
Jiggler!

1094
01:05:41.156 --> 01:05:42.610
Tristain is a liar.

1095
01:05:42.612 --> 01:05:46.524
He's the one who tried
to kill Prince Roland.

1096
01:05:46.526 --> 01:05:47.730
What do you mean tried?

1097
01:05:47.732 --> 01:05:50.520
I killed... that's
not what I meant.

1098
01:05:50.522 --> 01:05:53.434
And he's also the one who
poisoned King Theobald.

1099
01:05:53.436 --> 01:05:54.890
That's horrible.

1100
01:05:54.892 --> 01:05:56.514
What nonsense.

1101
01:05:56.516 --> 01:05:59.428
Seriously, who's going
to believe this urchin?

1102
01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.675
They'll believe me.

1103
01:06:01.677 --> 01:06:05.879
Oh, cockerel, it's Prince
Roland in his undies.

1104
01:06:05.881 --> 01:06:07.004
So he's not dead either?

1105
01:06:07.006 --> 01:06:09.002
When I kill people and
they don't stay dead,

1106
01:06:09.004 --> 01:06:10.417
it gets on my nerves.

1107
01:06:10.419 --> 01:06:13.330
Listen, there's been a
terrible misunderstanding.

1108
01:06:13.332 --> 01:06:15.995
Let me explain what
really happened.

1109
01:06:15.997 --> 01:06:17.076
Oh, look behind you.

1110
01:06:17.078 --> 01:06:17.784
It's horrible.

1111
01:06:17.786 --> 01:06:18.242
What?

1112
01:06:18.244 --> 01:06:18.992
Where?

1113
01:06:18.994 --> 01:06:19.698
What is it?

1114
01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:20.700
What?

1115
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:25.445
You lied to be king here!

1116
01:06:28.942 --> 01:06:30.897
Don't let him get away.

1117
01:06:30.899 --> 01:06:36.515
Crobar, I'm really
sorry I lied to you.

1118
01:06:36.517 --> 01:06:38.347
It's all right, Princess.

1119
01:06:38.349 --> 01:06:41.676
It's all right.

1120
01:06:41.678 --> 01:06:45.506
You don't have to call
me Princess anymore.

1121
01:06:45.508 --> 01:06:48.837
Whatever you want, Princess.

1122
01:06:48.839 --> 01:06:51.708
Hey, what about me?

1123
01:06:51.710 --> 01:06:52.710
Group hug.

1124
01:07:01.243 --> 01:07:03.822
Catapults, ready.

1125
01:07:13.064 --> 01:07:14.645
And fire!

1126
01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:26.382
We can't stay here.

1127
01:07:26.384 --> 01:07:28.172
We have to leave the city.

1128
01:07:28.174 --> 01:07:29.838
And let Tristain win?

1129
01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:30.919
No way on Earth.

1130
01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:32.959
I'll teach him not to
go after my friends.

1131
01:07:32.961 --> 01:07:35.290
And I must prevent him
from using his magic

1132
01:07:35.292 --> 01:07:36.621
on Foggyborough.

1133
01:07:36.623 --> 01:07:39.369
Mr. Destardo and I will
sabotage the catapults.

1134
01:07:39.371 --> 01:07:40.617
Excuse me?

1135
01:07:40.619 --> 01:07:42.741
All right, I'll go
get reinforcements.

1136
01:07:42.743 --> 01:07:44.239
I'll open the
portcullis, Prince,

1137
01:07:44.241 --> 01:07:46.279
so you can get
inside the castle.

1138
01:07:46.281 --> 01:07:47.111
Perfect.

1139
01:07:47.113 --> 01:07:49.026
Now let's do this.

1140
01:08:02.057 --> 01:08:05.177
This is a rotten plan.

1141
01:08:05.179 --> 01:08:06.466
Let's go, let's go.

1142
01:08:06.468 --> 01:08:08.589
All right, go guard
the portcullis.

1143
01:08:08.591 --> 01:08:10.672
George, you got the
ramparts, and try

1144
01:08:10.674 --> 01:08:12.211
not to fall off this time.

1145
01:08:39.977 --> 01:08:40.977
Tristain.

1146
01:08:43.182 --> 01:08:44.428
Godmother.

1147
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:47.135
You must stop this madness.

1148
01:08:47.137 --> 01:08:50.007
Why have you become so cruel?

1149
01:08:50.009 --> 01:08:51.463
I am not cruel.

1150
01:08:51.465 --> 01:08:54.418
I'm powerful, and I
intend to stay that way.

1151
01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.001
Drink this, Nugget.

1152
01:09:13.152 --> 01:09:13.858
Hi there.

1153
01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:14.860
Hi.

1154
01:09:29.969 --> 01:09:30.966
A fire!

1155
01:09:30.968 --> 01:09:31.923
I'm on fire!

1156
01:09:31.925 --> 01:09:32.925
Fire!

1157
01:09:38.251 --> 01:09:42.204
People of Foggyborough, forward!

1158
01:09:42.206 --> 01:09:43.828
Attack!

1159
01:09:55.693 --> 01:09:56.731
Take that.

1160
01:09:56.733 --> 01:09:57.523
That's it.

1161
01:09:57.525 --> 01:09:59.146
Hit them hard.

1162
01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.933
Throw them back.

1163
01:10:03.935 --> 01:10:05.140
Come on, do something.

1164
01:10:05.142 --> 01:10:06.721
Move.

1165
01:10:06.723 --> 01:10:09.177
Hey, George, that's a mace in
your hand, not a mutton chop.

1166
01:10:09.179 --> 01:10:11.841
And you, Alrick, are you afraid
of scratching your shield

1167
01:10:11.843 --> 01:10:12.674
or what?

1168
01:10:12.676 --> 01:10:14.506
Don't make me come down there.

1169
01:10:14.508 --> 01:10:16.046
What was that?

1170
01:10:16.048 --> 01:10:17.794
What are you doing?

1171
01:10:17.796 --> 01:10:18.709
Me?

1172
01:10:18.711 --> 01:10:19.667
Nothing.

1173
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:24.496
I was... well, I'd
better be going.

1174
01:10:26.912 --> 01:10:28.283
Wait right there, you.

1175
01:10:32.989 --> 01:10:36.983
I've never seen this
guy before in my life.

1176
01:10:36.985 --> 01:10:38.148
We're goners.

1177
01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:39.188
Run, Jiggler!

1178
01:10:39.190 --> 01:10:40.022
Run!

1179
01:10:40.024 --> 01:10:41.355
Run for your life!

1180
01:10:45.309 --> 01:10:46.681
This is bad, Mr. Destardo.

1181
01:10:46.683 --> 01:10:48.472
No, no, we'll be safe in here.

1182
01:10:48.474 --> 01:10:50.844
Don't worry.

1183
01:10:50.846 --> 01:10:52.217
Maybe not.

1184
01:10:56.508 --> 01:11:01.166
Nugget, get rid of her.

1185
01:11:45.791 --> 01:11:49.369
Hey, what say we
just talk this over?

1186
01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:51.119
Fire, fire, fire!

1187
01:11:57.816 --> 01:11:58.816
Water!

1188
01:11:58.872 --> 01:12:00.346
I need water!

1189
01:12:08.891 --> 01:12:11.345
Jiggler, be honest with me.

1190
01:12:11.347 --> 01:12:13.676
Do I have flaming
undies on my head?

1191
01:12:13.678 --> 01:12:15.674
Yes, Mr. Destardo.

1192
01:12:15.676 --> 01:12:17.589
Get them off of me!

1193
01:12:25.291 --> 01:12:26.330
That's bad.

1194
01:12:33.325 --> 01:12:35.488
Hey, Jiggler, I can't blow.

1195
01:12:35.490 --> 01:12:36.987
Hold the door, Mr. Destardo.

1196
01:12:36.989 --> 01:12:38.610
I'll take care of it.

1197
01:12:57.135 --> 01:13:00.296
Oh, cockerel, that
was not water.

1198
01:13:00.298 --> 01:13:02.627
What do we do now?

1199
01:13:02.629 --> 01:13:04.043
We yell.

1200
01:13:04.045 --> 01:13:05.045
Oh, good idea.

1201
01:13:22.443 --> 01:13:24.813
Pil.

1202
01:13:24.815 --> 01:13:26.811
You have to make him drink this.

1203
01:13:34.763 --> 01:13:35.763
No!

1204
01:13:43.922 --> 01:13:46.833
Pil needs you now.

1205
01:13:53.245 --> 01:13:54.245
Oh, no, Pil.

1206
01:13:58.323 --> 01:14:00.652
I need powder for the cannon.

1207
01:14:00.654 --> 01:14:01.985
Let me in.

1208
01:14:01.987 --> 01:14:03.983
Let me get out.

1209
01:14:03.985 --> 01:14:05.231
Jiggler, where are you?

1210
01:14:05.233 --> 01:14:06.938
I need powder for the cannon.

1211
01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.811
I can't help you, Crobar.

1212
01:14:08.813 --> 01:14:10.642
I'm stuck in here.

1213
01:14:10.644 --> 01:14:14.514
Jiggler, if I hold the
door, you can go help him.

1214
01:14:14.516 --> 01:14:15.346
Go on.

1215
01:14:15.348 --> 01:14:17.261
But, Mr. Destardo, then you'll...

1216
01:14:17.263 --> 01:14:19.674
Yes, I won't get out of here.

1217
01:14:19.676 --> 01:14:26.667
Mr. Destardo, what am I
going to do without you?

1218
01:14:26.669 --> 01:14:30.373
You've got what it takes to
be a great jester, Jiggler.

1219
01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:33.037
Me, I'm nothing but a sock.

1220
01:14:33.039 --> 01:14:36.533
Maybe, but you're
also my best friend.

1221
01:14:36.535 --> 01:14:40.154
You've got other friends now,
and they need you, Jiggler.

1222
01:14:40.156 --> 01:14:43.069
I'll always be with
you in your heart.

1223
01:14:43.071 --> 01:14:46.107
Now tie me to this
door, and finish this!

1224
01:14:48.398 --> 01:14:49.895
See, little girl,
that's what you

1225
01:14:49.897 --> 01:14:51.393
get for acting like a princess.

1226
01:14:51.395 --> 01:14:53.808
No one can stop me.

1227
01:15:16.995 --> 01:15:18.700
Hurry up, Jiggler.

1228
01:15:26.902 --> 01:15:28.690
Goodbye, Mr. Destardo.

1229
01:15:38.348 --> 01:15:40.344
Things are getting
hot in there, fool.

1230
01:15:43.218 --> 01:15:44.674
Oh, mommy.

1231
01:15:53.499 --> 01:15:54.664
I got you.

1232
01:15:54.666 --> 01:15:55.495
I got you.

1233
01:15:55.497 --> 01:15:56.037
I got you.

1234
01:15:56.039 --> 01:15:56.703
I got you.

1235
01:15:56.705 --> 01:15:58.285
I got you.

1236
01:15:58.287 --> 01:16:00.283
I got you.

1237
01:16:00.285 --> 01:16:01.948
Thanks, Jiggler.

1238
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:04.112
No problem.

1239
01:16:11.981 --> 01:16:14.310
I've had enough of this.

1240
01:16:21.347 --> 01:16:23.343
Guys, get out of here now!

1241
01:16:43.367 --> 01:16:45.738
Prince Roland, raise
the drawbridge.

1242
01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:47.069
All right, Crobar.

1243
01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:06.050
Come on, we can make it.

1244
01:17:06.052 --> 01:17:06.842
We can make it.

1245
01:17:06.844 --> 01:17:07.632
We can make it.

1246
01:17:07.634 --> 01:17:08.673
We can make it.

1247
01:17:08.675 --> 01:17:09.675
We made it!

1248
01:17:12.254 --> 01:17:13.585
Let her go, Nugget.

1249
01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:18.788
No!

1250
01:17:35.648 --> 01:17:36.687
Well done.

1251
01:17:36.689 --> 01:17:39.225
Crobar, this potion
will slay that dragon.

1252
01:17:39.227 --> 01:17:40.932
I'll take care of it.

1253
01:17:40.934 --> 01:17:43.970
Come here, you filthy beast.

1254
01:17:47.678 --> 01:17:48.678
Oh, no.

1255
01:17:50.633 --> 01:17:52.961
Poor Crobar, did
you actually think

1256
01:17:52.963 --> 01:17:54.876
that you could slay a dragon?

1257
01:17:54.878 --> 01:17:56.750
You think you're knight worthy?

1258
01:17:56.752 --> 01:17:59.913
Come on, open your eyes.

1259
01:17:59.915 --> 01:18:01.827
You're a good-for-nothing.

1260
01:18:04.327 --> 01:18:05.782
I'm sorry, Princess.

1261
01:18:05.784 --> 01:18:07.988
I can't protect you.

1262
01:18:07.990 --> 01:18:09.070
He's right.

1263
01:18:09.072 --> 01:18:11.068
I'm a good-for-nothing.

1264
01:18:15.316 --> 01:18:20.101
My loyal Crobar, you have
served and protected me,

1265
01:18:20.103 --> 01:18:22.557
with honor and courage.

1266
01:18:22.559 --> 01:18:26.678
Would you do me the
honor of being my knight?

1267
01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:28.842
Yes, Princess.

1268
01:18:28.844 --> 01:18:32.796
Do you swear you'll fight to
uphold justice and fairness?

1269
01:18:32.798 --> 01:18:34.295
I swear I will, Princess.

1270
01:18:34.297 --> 01:18:37.042
Then I hereby dub you my knight.

1271
01:18:37.044 --> 01:18:41.663
You are Sir Crobar
of Foggyborough.

1272
01:18:41.665 --> 01:18:44.327
I always knew you
were noble, Princess.

1273
01:18:44.329 --> 01:18:46.824
Noble in your heart.

1274
01:18:46.826 --> 01:18:47.823
Of course.

1275
01:18:47.825 --> 01:18:50.903
That's the answer to the riddle.

1276
01:18:50.905 --> 01:18:52.277
Tristain, hold on.

1277
01:18:52.279 --> 01:18:54.774
I have something that
might interest you.

1278
01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:58.355
"To build a kingdom, one must
know where nobility resides."

1279
01:18:58.357 --> 01:19:01.976
Nobility is in your heart.

1280
01:19:06.349 --> 01:19:07.178
What is that?

1281
01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.052
A treasure?

1282
01:19:09.054 --> 01:19:11.841
Yes, the Theobald treasure.

1283
01:19:11.843 --> 01:19:14.005
You want it, don't you?

1284
01:19:14.007 --> 01:19:16.794
Oh, yes.

1285
01:19:16.796 --> 01:19:18.043
Then come and get it.

1286
01:19:21.791 --> 01:19:22.791
My treasure.

1287
01:19:26.329 --> 01:19:27.576
Gobbly, the chew toy.

1288
01:19:37.650 --> 01:19:38.814
Just paper?

1289
01:19:38.816 --> 01:19:41.270
What kind of treasure is that?

1290
01:19:41.272 --> 01:19:43.601
I'll get you for
this, you little brat.

1291
01:19:49.514 --> 01:19:51.343
You don't stand a chance.

1292
01:19:51.345 --> 01:19:54.881
Nugget, do you want
a yummy chew toy?

1293
01:20:40.088 --> 01:20:46.662
Princess, meeting you is the
greatest adventure of my life.

1294
01:20:46.664 --> 01:20:47.996
Crobar!

1295
01:21:08.517 --> 01:21:11.474
Prince Roland, you saved me.

1296
01:21:14.678 --> 01:21:15.176
Undies!

1297
01:21:15.178 --> 01:21:16.674
Undies!

1298
01:21:16.676 --> 01:21:17.341
Undies!

1299
01:21:17.343 --> 01:21:18.839
I need some undies!

1300
01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:19.922
Come on, Nugget.

1301
01:21:19.924 --> 01:21:21.462
Nugget, quickly.

1302
01:21:21.464 --> 01:21:22.961
Get out of here now.

1303
01:21:25.667 --> 01:21:28.163
And don't you ever set
foot in Foggyborough

1304
01:21:28.165 --> 01:21:29.120
again, you scoundrels.

1305
01:21:29.122 --> 01:21:31.243
Yeah, don't come back!

1306
01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:37.611
Pil.

1307
01:21:37.613 --> 01:21:38.985
Crobar.

1308
01:21:38.987 --> 01:21:39.987
Where are you, Pil?

1309
01:21:47.645 --> 01:21:50.473
Pil.

1310
01:21:50.475 --> 01:21:51.475
Pil.

1311
01:21:56.137 --> 01:21:57.137
Crobar?

1312
01:22:00.008 --> 01:22:01.008
Crobar.

1313
01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:05.461
Crobar.

1314
01:22:10.123 --> 01:22:11.123
Crobar.

1315
01:22:15.076 --> 01:22:18.071
Crobar, don't leave me.

1316
01:22:18.073 --> 01:22:20.568
I need you here.

1317
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:22.608
Can you hear me?

1318
01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:24.981
Wake up, Crobar.

1319
01:22:24.983 --> 01:22:26.979
That's an order, you hear me?

1320
01:22:26.981 --> 01:22:32.016
You're my loyal knight
now, and you must obey me.

1321
01:22:32.018 --> 01:22:33.599
Don't leave me, Crobar.

1322
01:22:37.928 --> 01:22:40.049
At your service, Princess.

1323
01:22:40.051 --> 01:22:41.051
Crobar.

1324
01:23:11.229 --> 01:23:12.226
Thank you.

1325
01:23:12.228 --> 01:23:13.725
Thank you, my friends.

1326
01:23:13.727 --> 01:23:15.972
Thanks for everything you
did for me and Foggyborough.

1327
01:23:23.675 --> 01:23:24.672
Of course.

1328
01:23:24.674 --> 01:23:27.044
This is it, the
Theobald treasure.

1329
01:24:10.502 --> 01:24:12.748
Hey.

1330
01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:13.830
I don't know you.

1331
01:24:13.832 --> 01:24:15.204
You're not from here.

1332
01:24:15.206 --> 01:24:16.827
Are you all alone?

1333
01:24:16.829 --> 01:24:18.825
If you want, you can
join our little gang.

1334
01:24:21.783 --> 01:24:23.237
This is Foggyborough.

1335
01:24:34.604 --> 01:24:38.514
Would you like to
meet my friends?

1336
01:24:38.516 --> 01:24:39.888
Woo-hoo!

1337
01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:45.673
Hello, madam sorceress.

1338
01:24:45.675 --> 01:24:48.546
So how are the
magic classes going?

1339
01:24:48.548 --> 01:24:49.378
Great.

1340
01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:53.000
My new pupils are fast learners.

1341
01:24:53.002 --> 01:24:54.002
Oh, wow.

1342
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:59.035
Ah, Pil, have you seen how
well the construction's going?

1343
01:24:59.037 --> 01:25:02.240
Look at that, my
father's treasure.

1344
01:25:02.242 --> 01:25:04.696
Yeah, well, actually
the treasure is mine,

1345
01:25:04.698 --> 01:25:08.317
but I decided to share
it with everybody.

1346
01:25:08.319 --> 01:25:10.732
The first orphanage
in Foggyborough,

1347
01:25:10.734 --> 01:25:14.686
and over there a library
open to every citizen

1348
01:25:14.688 --> 01:25:19.431
to enjoy, and there a hospital
to take care of sick people

1349
01:25:19.433 --> 01:25:20.180
in town.

1350
01:25:20.182 --> 01:25:21.387
That's right.

1351
01:25:21.389 --> 01:25:23.177
The treasure was a
plan, instructions

1352
01:25:23.179 --> 01:25:26.799
for a new village King Theobald
wanted to build for his people.

1353
01:25:26.801 --> 01:25:27.965
Hey, ho.

1354
01:25:27.967 --> 01:25:30.504
Time to eat, cockerel.

1355
01:25:30.506 --> 01:25:32.419
Crobar.

1356
01:25:32.421 --> 01:25:33.875
My little princess.

1357
01:25:33.877 --> 01:25:38.162
Come on, mince tarts
for everyone, cockerel.

1358
01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.740
Hey, hey, I've got a joke.

1359
01:25:43.742 --> 01:25:46.612
What's the difference between
King Roland and a brick wall?

1360
01:25:46.614 --> 01:25:48.735
Hold on, let's play
some music, huh?

1361
01:25:48.737 --> 01:25:50.317
And loud.

1362
01:25:50.319 --> 01:25:52.815
A brick wall isn't as thick.

1363
01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:00.307
He said, thick as a brick wall.

1364
01:26:00.309 --> 01:26:01.309
I don't get it.

1365
01:26:12.088 --> 01:26:13.669
Dash those worries.

1366
01:26:13.671 --> 01:26:14.502
Sing out loud.

1367
01:26:14.504 --> 01:26:15.667
The cat is a chicken.

1368
01:26:15.669 --> 01:26:16.791
The chicken a cat.

1369
01:26:16.793 --> 01:26:18.373
Together we're strong,
and nothing can stop us.

1370
01:26:18.375 --> 01:26:20.162
Cockerel, beware.

1371
01:26:35.524 --> 01:26:36.896
Dash those worries.

1372
01:26:36.898 --> 01:26:37.853
Sing out loud.

1373
01:26:37.855 --> 01:26:38.810
The cat is a chicken.

1374
01:26:38.812 --> 01:26:40.142
The chicken a cat.

1375
01:26:40.144 --> 01:26:41.807
Together we're strong,
and nothing can stop us.

1376
01:26:41.809 --> 01:26:43.141
Cockerel, beware.

1377
01:26:51.467 --> 01:26:51.922
Sing it.

1378
01:26:51.924 --> 01:26:52.671
Sing it.

1379
01:26:52.673 --> 01:26:53.380
Sing a melody.

1380
01:26:53.382 --> 01:26:54.211
The cat is a chicken.

1381
01:26:54.213 --> 01:26:55.502
The chicken a cat.

1382
01:26:55.504 --> 01:26:57.166
Raise your head, and
keep moving forward.

1383
01:26:57.168 --> 01:27:00.163
Nothing can stop us now.

1384
01:27:31.759 --> 01:27:34.046
Ladies.

1385
01:27:34.048 --> 01:27:36.170
I liked him better
in his undies.

1386
01:27:36.172 --> 01:27:37.585
Me too.

1387
01:28:22.874 --> 01:28:25.662
Oh, the brick wall.

1388
01:28:25.664 --> 01:28:28.534
It isn't as thick.

1389
01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:29.824
I get it.
