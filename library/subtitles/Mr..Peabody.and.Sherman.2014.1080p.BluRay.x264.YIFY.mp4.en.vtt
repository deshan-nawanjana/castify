00:00:57.891 --> 00:01:00.226
Our story begins high
over New York City...

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.978
in the luxurious
penthouse apartment...

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:05.758
of perhaps the most unlikely
genius the world has ever known.

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:09.318
Oh. Sorry. You caught
me doing my yoga.

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:12.556
You were expecting
downward dog, perhaps?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.160
My name is Mr. Peabody. And since we're
going to be spending some time together...

00:01:18.161 --> 00:01:20.371
I'd like to tell you a
little bit about myself.

00:01:20.372 --> 00:01:23.950
You see, ever since I was a pup...
it was clear that I was different.

00:01:25.586 --> 00:01:27.128
I tried to fit in...

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:28.254
No, thank you.

00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:30.282
But never could.

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:33.050
As I grew, I saw more and
more of my littermates...

00:01:33.051 --> 00:01:36.125
being chosen by their new families.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.754
But for some reason, I never was.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.758
Come on, boy! Fetch the stick!

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:46.063
But why? Won't you
just throw it again?

00:01:46.064 --> 00:01:48.524
It's an exercise in futility.

00:01:48.525 --> 00:01:51.193
I don't want this one,
Mommy. He's sarcastic.

00:01:51.194 --> 00:01:53.362
Wait, wait! Come back!
Throw the stick.

00:01:53.363 --> 00:01:56.240
I'll stay, I'll heel,
I'll even shake hands.

00:01:56.241 --> 00:01:57.950
Bark, bark?

00:01:57.951 --> 00:02:01.287
So, without a family of my own...

00:02:01.288 --> 00:02:04.040
I dedicated myself to
the pursuit of knowledge...

00:02:04.041 --> 00:02:06.459
culture, and athletics.

00:02:08.211 --> 00:02:10.254
I received my degree at Harvard.

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.173
Vale-dog-torian, of course.

00:02:12.174 --> 00:02:13.299
Yay!

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.385
And then, I devoted myself
to helping mankind.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:19.221
I pioneered new techniques
in alternative energy.

00:02:21.224 --> 00:02:22.600
Yay!

00:02:22.601 --> 00:02:25.470
Resolved geopolitical
conflicts around the globe.

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:29.565
And in my spare time...

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:32.234
I invented the fist bump,
planking, tearaway pants...

00:02:32.235 --> 00:02:33.402
Auto-Tune...

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:34.695
the backside ollie...

00:02:34.696 --> 00:02:35.863
and Zumba.

00:02:35.864 --> 00:02:37.811
Now go

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.396
Stop

00:02:39.493 --> 00:02:40.940
Drop

00:02:41.411 --> 00:02:42.937
Pause

00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:46.999
But what I'm most proud of
is my son, Sherman.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.168
Hi, Mr. Peabody.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.005
Oh! Have you told
them about the WABAC?

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:55.257
I was just getting to that.

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:58.761
When I adopted Sherman, I vowed
to be the best father I could be.

00:02:58.762 --> 00:03:01.138
To prepare him for all
the wonders of the world,

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:02.932
present and past.

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:07.679
And so, Sherman inspired the
greatest invention of my life...

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:10.677
a time machine.

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:20.366
Of course, time travel
can be a bit unpredictable.

00:03:20.367 --> 00:03:23.202
There are bound to be
a few mishaps along the way.

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:24.704
Let's just say,
the Leaning Tower of Pisa

00:03:24.705 --> 00:03:26.706
wasn't always leaning.

00:03:26.707 --> 00:03:27.957
But there's nothing like learning

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:29.166
the lessons of history firsthand.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.292
Right, Sherman?

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:32.336
Where are we going
today, Mr. Peabody?

00:03:32.337 --> 00:03:33.963
Not "where," Sherman.

00:03:33.964 --> 00:03:36.207
"When."

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:51.981
Whoa! This is the biggest
house I've ever seen!

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:55.025
It's the Palace of Versailles,
home of Marie Antoinette.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:57.653
You know, she was mostly
famous for one thing.

00:03:57.654 --> 00:03:59.029
Cake!

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.491
I love cake so much.

00:04:06.413 --> 00:04:09.373
Marie Antoinette sure
likes cake, Mr. Peabody.

00:04:09.374 --> 00:04:10.666
- Oh!
- Indeed she does.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:12.668
Marie was a woman with a
prodigious appetite...

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.837
for all things
covered with frosting.

00:04:14.838 --> 00:04:18.174
But her expensive tastes made her
the target of much criticism.

00:04:18.175 --> 00:04:20.009
- Why?
- Because, Sherman...

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.677
during Marie's reign,
the common people

00:04:21.678 --> 00:04:23.580
of France were exceedingly poor.

00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:25.347
You've got any bread?

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:28.592
No! I'm exceedingly poor.

00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:30.352
Now, can we have some cake?

00:04:30.353 --> 00:04:31.520
Mais, oui.

00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:34.190
Oh, yeah, sorry.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:35.858
"May we" have some cake?

00:04:35.859 --> 00:04:37.431
Mais, oui!

00:04:37.527 --> 00:04:39.195
Maybe she can't hear me
through the hair.

00:04:39.196 --> 00:04:41.489
Sherman, what the queen means is...

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.894
Ah! Let them eat cake!

00:04:47.537 --> 00:04:50.873
When the queen heard the poor of
Paris could not even buy bread...

00:04:50.874 --> 00:04:53.292
she said, "Let them eat cake."

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.251
No!

00:04:54.252 --> 00:04:55.586
I heard it myself.

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:56.921
- It's a scandal!
- It's an outrage!

00:04:56.922 --> 00:04:58.130
Down with the queen!

00:04:58.131 --> 00:04:59.532
Down with the monarchy!

00:04:59.549 --> 00:05:00.758
Wait!

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.786
What kind of cake?

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.478
Smashing party, Your Majesty.

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.147
But now, I'm afraid
Sherman and I must be...

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:17.566
Sherman? Sherman?

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:19.685
Sherman!

00:05:21.238 --> 00:05:23.311
Sherman?

00:05:25.116 --> 00:05:28.144
Sherman! Here, Sherman.

00:05:28.286 --> 00:05:29.745
Hey, Mr. Peabody.

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:31.622
What are you doing in here?

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:32.998
Trying these other cakes.

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:37.745
There's one in here with whipped
cream and strawberries that's...

00:05:37.838 --> 00:05:39.129
pretty fantastic!

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.422
Sherman...

00:05:40.423 --> 00:05:42.424
don't you remember
why I told you to stay

00:05:42.425 --> 00:05:44.426
close to me during
the French Revolution?

00:05:44.427 --> 00:05:46.303
Because after
the French Revolution...

00:05:46.304 --> 00:05:48.097
- it was gonna rain?
- Close.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.599
I said, "After the
French Revolution comes...

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:52.810
the Reign of Terror!"

00:05:58.275 --> 00:06:01.193
Round up the aristocrats.

00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:18.711
The queen and her
aristocratic cronies...

00:06:18.712 --> 00:06:21.630
must pay the price
for their gluttony.

00:06:21.631 --> 00:06:24.717
We will slaughter them
like the dogs they are.

00:06:24.718 --> 00:06:27.041
Starting with this one!

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:28.538
Mr. Peabody!

00:06:28.972 --> 00:06:30.472
What should I do?

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:33.475
Nothing, Sherman.
Just stay right there.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.810
But, Mr. Peabody!

00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:36.812
Everything is going
to be fine, Sherman.

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.887
Just stay right there.

00:06:45.864 --> 00:06:48.107
Off with his head!

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:53.192
Mr. Peabody!

00:06:58.335 --> 00:07:00.002
A cantaloupe?

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:01.921
The lowest of the fruits.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:05.747
Who dares to insult me
with this melon?

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.294
Get that dog!

00:07:12.515 --> 00:07:15.017
Mr. Peabody, how did you escape?

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:16.226
It's simple, Sherman.

00:07:16.227 --> 00:07:18.103
I noticed the distance
between the sewer lids...

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.521
reasoned that there must be one

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:20.898
directly under
the guillotine platform...

00:07:20.899 --> 00:07:22.524
noted the loose board
under the basket...

00:07:22.525 --> 00:07:23.692
computed the angle at
which the setting sun

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:24.944
would bounce off your glasses...

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:26.904
momentarily blinding
the executioner...

00:07:26.905 --> 00:07:28.906
and chose that moment to swipe
the executioner's melon...

00:07:28.907 --> 00:07:32.076
giving me the added weight to tip
the boards, facilitating my exit.

00:07:32.077 --> 00:07:33.410
That's amazing!

00:07:33.411 --> 00:07:34.578
It's not amazing.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:37.039
It was just a matter
of keeping my head.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.192
"Keeping your head."

00:07:39.376 --> 00:07:40.626
I don't get it.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:43.045
There he is! After them!

00:07:43.046 --> 00:07:45.119
Come, Sherman, quick!

00:07:48.385 --> 00:07:50.761
Oh, this water tastes terrible.

00:07:50.762 --> 00:07:52.721
Interestingly, that's not water.

00:07:56.017 --> 00:07:58.010
Ha-ha!

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.553
I've got you now.

00:08:01.606 --> 00:08:03.983
Indeed you have,
Monsieur Robespierre.

00:08:03.984 --> 00:08:06.860
And what a master
of the chase you are.

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.070
Oh, you noticed?

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:09.196
Of course.

00:08:09.197 --> 00:08:10.739
Doubling back on me like that.

00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:11.991
That was genius.

00:08:11.992 --> 00:08:13.158
Thank you.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:15.244
I just hope you don't take
my little confederate, here.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:16.912
I depend on him so completely.

00:08:16.913 --> 00:08:18.163
Get over here, you.

00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.915
Drats! You're devilishly clever.

00:08:19.916 --> 00:08:22.459
I know. And much quicker
than you as well.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.128
But are you quick enough for this?

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:25.754
Ha-ha! See? Quick!

00:08:25.755 --> 00:08:27.840
Quick, yes, but not too smart.

00:08:27.841 --> 00:08:30.539
Oh! Another cantaloupe!

00:08:30.593 --> 00:08:31.994
Your sword!

00:08:32.095 --> 00:08:34.054
All right, Sherman,
looks like it's time

00:08:34.055 --> 00:08:35.973
for a little pop quiz
in the art of fencing.

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:37.266
Go!

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:39.810
Attack! Parry! Thrust! Repeat!

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:41.520
- No.
- Remise!

00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.896
Good boy!

00:08:53.241 --> 00:08:55.034
Oh!

00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:58.495
Huh?

00:08:58.496 --> 00:08:59.955
Ha-ha! You missed!

00:08:59.956 --> 00:09:01.123
I never miss.

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:07.613
Hop on!

00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:09.214
Whoa!

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.467
Whoa! Whoa!

00:09:11.468 --> 00:09:14.747
Yeah! Whoa!

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.057
Yeah!

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:19.558
Do you smell that, Sherman?

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:21.060
It wasn't me, Mr. Peabody.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:22.144
I know it wasn't you.

00:09:22.145 --> 00:09:23.979
It's the methane gas
in the sewer system.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.149
And given the fact that it ignites
at 306 degrees Fahrenheit...

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:28.317
we're about to use it...

00:09:28.318 --> 00:09:30.061
to blast out of here!

00:09:30.403 --> 00:09:32.396
Hang on!

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.562
Whoo!

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:45.071
Wow!

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.914
- Nice landing, eh, Sherman?
- Oof!

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.222
So, what did you
learn today, Sherman?

00:09:58.223 --> 00:10:00.557
That French Revolution was crazy.

00:10:00.558 --> 00:10:01.725
How so?

00:10:01.726 --> 00:10:04.103
All those guys getting
their heads chopped off...

00:10:04.104 --> 00:10:06.855
and nobody standing up
and saying it wasn't right.

00:10:06.856 --> 00:10:09.525
And think, Marie Antoinette could
have avoided the whole revolution...

00:10:09.526 --> 00:10:11.151
if she'd simply issued an edict

00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:12.861
to distribute
bread amongst the poor.

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:14.696
But then, she couldn't
have had her dessert.

00:10:14.697 --> 00:10:16.198
Why not, Mr. Peabody?

00:10:16.199 --> 00:10:18.200
Because, Sherman, you can't have

00:10:18.201 --> 00:10:20.661
your cake and edict, too.

00:10:22.372 --> 00:10:23.539
I don't get it.

00:10:33.883 --> 00:10:36.093
Where are we gonna go
tomorrow, Mr. Peabody?

00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:39.263
Ancient Rome? The Wild West? 1492?

00:10:39.264 --> 00:10:42.891
No, Sherman, tomorrow we won't
be going to any of those places.

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:44.101
Oh. Why not?

00:10:44.102 --> 00:10:45.394
Because tomorrow's adventure...

00:10:45.395 --> 00:10:48.397
is one that you're going to
be taking all on your own.

00:10:48.398 --> 00:10:49.940
What do you mean, Mr. Peabody?

00:10:49.941 --> 00:10:51.108
Don't you remember?

00:10:51.109 --> 00:10:52.484
It's your first day of school.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:55.013
- Oh. Can I drive?
- Of course not.

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.084
Remember, Sherman,
"I" before "e," except after "c."

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:10.919
I know, Mr. Peabody!

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.005
And don't forget about
the commutative principle.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.673
Two plus three
equals three plus two.

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.508
I know, Mr. Peabody!

00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:17.676
And if you have to
go to the bathroom...

00:11:17.677 --> 00:11:20.137
just raise your hand proudly
and say, "I have to go."

00:11:20.138 --> 00:11:21.972
I will, Mr. Peabody.

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.850
And remember, the No. 2 pencil
is standard for most uses...

00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.269
but there are times when
a No. 1 comes in handy.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:28.854
I left a little pencil chart
in your backpack...

00:11:28.855 --> 00:11:31.607
which you can consult if it
ever becomes a judgment call.

00:11:31.608 --> 00:11:35.057
I think I'll be okay!

00:11:37.447 --> 00:11:38.530
Okay, bye, Mr. Peabody.

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.656
Wait.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:40.991
- See you after school.
- Sherman!

00:11:40.992 --> 00:11:44.119
I gotta go. I gotta
sign up for the clubs.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.996
No one is more in
favor of participation

00:11:45.997 --> 00:11:47.956
in fraternal organizations than I.

00:11:47.957 --> 00:11:51.577
But before you go,
I want you to have this.

00:11:51.628 --> 00:11:53.337
Thanks. What is it?

00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:55.411
A dog whistle.

00:11:59.802 --> 00:12:02.471
It doesn't work, Mr. Peabody.

00:12:02.472 --> 00:12:05.849
It works fine, Sherman.

00:12:05.850 --> 00:12:08.753
It's just a frequency
only dogs can hear.

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:10.145
Oh, cool.

00:12:10.146 --> 00:12:12.856
Let that little keepsake
be a reminder to you...

00:12:12.857 --> 00:12:15.150
that no matter what
challenges you face,

00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:17.402
no matter how far
away I might seem...

00:12:17.403 --> 00:12:20.056
Bye, Mr. Peabody!

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.478
I'm with you.

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:34.661
George Washington.

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:37.673
Who can tell me who he is?

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.633
Oh, me! I can! I can!

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:41.885
Uh... Sherman.

00:12:41.886 --> 00:12:44.846
The first president of the
United States of America.

00:12:44.847 --> 00:12:46.181
Good job.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:49.226
And when President Washington
was a little boy...

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:52.229
what kind of tree did he cut down?

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.522
Ooh! Ooh, me! Me! Me!

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:55.565
- Penny?
- A cherry tree.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:56.775
Apocryphal.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:58.026
What kind of tree is that?

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.445
It's not a tree. It's a word.
"Apocryphal."

00:13:00.446 --> 00:13:02.281
It means that story is not true.

00:13:02.282 --> 00:13:04.032
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:13:04.033 --> 00:13:06.118
George Washington never
cut down a cherry tree...

00:13:06.119 --> 00:13:07.869
and he never said he couldn't lie.

00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:10.872
People made those stories up to
teach kids a lesson about lying...

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:11.915
but they're not true.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:13.250
He did cross the Delaware River,

00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:16.211
Christmas night, 1776, though.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:18.630
My dad took me there this summer.
We crossed it, too.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:21.033
I fell in.

00:13:21.801 --> 00:13:26.331
Looks like someone really knows
their history, huh, Penny?

00:13:32.395 --> 00:13:33.895
It's really great meeting you guys.

00:13:33.896 --> 00:13:35.981
Maybe you can come over
to my house sometime.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:38.942
I could bring my new model.
It's a hydrogen atom.

00:13:38.943 --> 00:13:40.736
You've only got one, huh?

00:13:40.737 --> 00:13:42.612
Guess we'll have to split it.

00:13:43.781 --> 00:13:45.182
Good one!

00:13:46.826 --> 00:13:48.648
Check it, guys.

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.664
What do you got there, Sherman?

00:13:52.665 --> 00:13:54.124
Kibbles or bits?

00:13:54.125 --> 00:13:56.418
Actually, I've got baby carrots,

00:13:56.419 --> 00:13:58.992
organic apple juice,
and a tuna sandwich.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:02.341
It's super-high in omega-3s.

00:14:02.342 --> 00:14:05.093
So, you eat human food, huh?

00:14:05.094 --> 00:14:06.762
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

00:14:06.763 --> 00:14:08.013
Because you're a dog.

00:14:08.014 --> 00:14:09.264
No, I'm not.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:12.601
Sure you are. Your dad is a
dog, so you're a dog, too.

00:14:12.602 --> 00:14:15.103
I think you're confused. It's
an adoptive relationship.

00:14:15.104 --> 00:14:16.772
- Zip it, Carl.
- Okay.

00:14:16.773 --> 00:14:19.346
Here, I'll show you. Fetch!

00:14:21.444 --> 00:14:23.612
Go on, doggy. Go get your lunch.

00:14:23.613 --> 00:14:24.696
Go on.

00:14:24.697 --> 00:14:25.781
Go get it.

00:14:27.367 --> 00:14:29.618
Ugh. The humiliation.

00:14:29.619 --> 00:14:32.454
Sherman, go get your food.

00:14:32.455 --> 00:14:34.414
Make like a good little doggy.

00:14:34.415 --> 00:14:36.283
Ruff-ruff!

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:43.840
- What's this?
- It's mine!

00:14:43.841 --> 00:14:45.425
Give it back!

00:14:45.426 --> 00:14:47.874
What is it? A whistle?

00:14:48.638 --> 00:14:50.889
Ugh! Stupid thing
doesn't even work.

00:14:50.890 --> 00:14:52.557
It's a dog whistle, Penny.

00:14:52.558 --> 00:14:55.143
It operates at a frequency
that only dogs can hear.

00:14:55.144 --> 00:14:56.895
- Back up, Carl.
- Okay.

00:14:56.896 --> 00:14:59.356
Penny, that whistle
is my private property.

00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.483
- Give it back!
- Jump, doggy, jump.

00:15:01.484 --> 00:15:02.818
I am not a dog.

00:15:02.819 --> 00:15:03.985
Come on, Sherman!

00:15:03.986 --> 00:15:06.822
Just admit it.
You're a dog. Say it.

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:08.031
Let me go!

00:15:08.032 --> 00:15:10.659
Not until you beg like a dog.

00:15:10.660 --> 00:15:12.577
Come on, Sherman. Beg!

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:15.330
Fight, fight, fight!

00:15:16.833 --> 00:15:20.836
Mr. Peabody, thank you for coming
in on such short notice...

00:15:20.837 --> 00:15:23.171
to discuss
the problem with Sherman.

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.173
Oh, it's not a problem
at all, Principal Purdy.

00:15:25.174 --> 00:15:26.508
I fully expected this.

00:15:26.509 --> 00:15:27.676
- You did?
- Yes.

00:15:27.677 --> 00:15:30.137
And, as with all things
Sherman-related, I prepared for it.

00:15:30.138 --> 00:15:31.596
Here's a curriculum
that takes Sherman's

00:15:31.597 --> 00:15:33.140
advanced preparation
into account...

00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:34.891
but won't require you to have
him skip one or more grades.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:35.976
Mr. Peabody...

00:15:35.977 --> 00:15:38.520
Here are some pre-algebra worksheets,
an advanced reading list...

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:40.397
and a link to a website I created

00:15:40.398 --> 00:15:42.315
so he can start
studying Mandarin Chinese.

00:15:42.316 --> 00:15:44.025
It is, after all,
the language of the future.

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:45.110
Mr. Peabody!

00:15:45.111 --> 00:15:47.279
I'm not saying he shouldn't study
French, too, Principal Purdy.

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.530
I'm saying have him do both.

00:15:48.531 --> 00:15:49.698
Mr. Peabody!

00:15:49.699 --> 00:15:51.491
What? Not enough? Swahili?

00:15:53.369 --> 00:15:55.521
Sherman got into a fight today.

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.447
Oh, dear.

00:15:57.874 --> 00:15:59.374
Pictures were taken...

00:15:59.375 --> 00:16:01.948
for insurance purposes.

00:16:08.885 --> 00:16:11.037
He bit her.

00:16:11.512 --> 00:16:16.057
I must say, it doesn't look
good for you, Mr. Peabody.

00:16:16.058 --> 00:16:19.311
After all, you are a dog.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:21.313
Who, may I ask, are you?

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:24.983
I am Ms. Grunion from the Bureau
of Child Safety and Protection.

00:16:24.984 --> 00:16:29.139
We're required by law to contact
them whenever there's an...

00:16:29.739 --> 00:16:31.140
incident.

00:16:31.407 --> 00:16:34.075
Sherman has never done
anything like this before.

00:16:34.076 --> 00:16:35.744
I'm sure he must have had a reason.

00:16:35.745 --> 00:16:37.704
Well, the girl was being
a bit of a bully...

00:16:37.705 --> 00:16:39.080
Quiet, Purdy!

00:16:39.081 --> 00:16:41.500
It's normal for children to tease.

00:16:41.501 --> 00:16:44.169
It's not normal for them to bite.

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:47.005
Clearly, it's because of
how he's being raised.

00:16:47.006 --> 00:16:49.799
In my opinion, a dog can never be

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.677
a suitable parent to a little boy.

00:16:52.678 --> 00:16:54.095
I must point out, Ms. Grunion...

00:16:54.096 --> 00:16:55.931
that I won
the right to adopt Sherman

00:16:55.932 --> 00:16:57.265
in a court of law.

00:16:57.266 --> 00:17:00.419
And the court can
take it away from you.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:04.773
I'll be coming to your home tomorrow
evening to conduct an investigation.

00:17:04.774 --> 00:17:08.568
If I discover that you are,
in anyway, an unfit parent...

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:12.690
I will see to it Sherman is
removed from your custody.

00:17:17.578 --> 00:17:19.480
Permanently.

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:23.322
I hope I've made myself clear.

00:17:26.546 --> 00:17:28.118
Crystal.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:32.592
I'm sorry I bit her, Mr. Peabody.

00:17:32.593 --> 00:17:34.135
I won't do it again.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:35.762
You're darn tooting
you won't do it again.

00:17:35.763 --> 00:17:38.807
This kind of wanton violence
is totally unacceptable.

00:17:38.808 --> 00:17:42.462
And rather uncharacteristic, given
how you feel about Mr. Gandhi.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:45.013
What on earth provoked it?

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:51.350
She called me a dog.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.858
Well, all right then.

00:18:02.582 --> 00:18:04.655
Thank you for telling me.

00:18:05.334 --> 00:18:07.577
Try and get some sleep.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:14.209
I love you, Mr. Peabody.

00:18:15.177 --> 00:18:18.547
I have a deep regard
for you as well, Sherman.

00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.987
Close your eyes

00:18:48.628 --> 00:18:50.905
Have no fear

00:18:52.423 --> 00:18:56.301
The master's gone He's on the run

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:59.046
And your daddy's here

00:19:01.349 --> 00:19:05.549
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

00:19:22.370 --> 00:19:24.647
Say a little prayer

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:30.877
Every day, in every way

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:34.077
It's getting better and better

00:19:35.841 --> 00:19:41.463
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

00:19:44.975 --> 00:19:50.176
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

00:19:53.526 --> 00:19:56.270
A hard road to hoe

00:19:56.487 --> 00:20:00.312
Yes, it's a long way to go

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:03.485
But in the meantime

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:12.695
Take my hand

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:20.711
Life is what happens to you while
you're busy making other plans

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:28.886
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:37.394
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

00:20:39.447 --> 00:20:40.739
Mr. Peabody...

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:42.949
you are a Nobel
Prize-winning scientist.

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:44.659
An advisor to heads of state.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.578
A captain of industry.

00:20:46.579 --> 00:20:49.247
Why would you want to adopt a boy?

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:50.915
Because, Your Honor...

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:56.671
when I found Sherman, it reminded
me of how I started out in life.

00:20:56.672 --> 00:21:00.675
And now, I want to give him
the one thing I always wanted.

00:21:00.676 --> 00:21:02.093
A home.

00:21:02.094 --> 00:21:04.846
And you're sure you're capable
of meeting all the challenges...

00:21:04.847 --> 00:21:06.848
of raising a human boy?

00:21:06.849 --> 00:21:10.423
With all due respect,
how hard could it be?

00:21:12.021 --> 00:21:13.354
Very well, then.

00:21:13.355 --> 00:21:15.523
If a boy can adopt a dog...

00:21:15.524 --> 00:21:19.599
I see no reason
why a dog cannot adopt a boy.

00:21:23.365 --> 00:21:25.033
Da-da!

00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:26.659
No, Sherman, not "Da-da."

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.037
You shall call me "Mr. Peabody."

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:31.790
Or, in less formal moments,
simply "Peabody."

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.709
That's right.

00:21:34.710 --> 00:21:36.612
"Mr. Pea-baba."

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:41.993
Beautiful, beautiful,
beautiful, beautiful boy

00:22:18.754 --> 00:22:19.963
What's cooking, Mr. Peabody?

00:22:19.964 --> 00:22:21.256
Oh, nothing much.

00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:24.592
Just a little Dungeness crab with
a passion-fruit basil concassé.

00:22:24.593 --> 00:22:26.719
Some truffled quails
in a juniper-berry reduction.

00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:28.721
And Baked Alaska.

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:31.432
Wow! Is today some
kind of special occasion?

00:22:31.433 --> 00:22:32.517
You could say.

00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:33.935
It's not my birthday.

00:22:33.936 --> 00:22:35.395
No, it isn't.

00:22:35.396 --> 00:22:36.604
It's not your birthday.

00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:37.939
Right again.

00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:40.108
It's not Father's Day. Is it?

00:22:40.109 --> 00:22:42.853
Nope. It's not Father's Day.

00:22:43.070 --> 00:22:45.071
Ls the president
coming to dinner again?

00:22:45.072 --> 00:22:47.240
- No.
- Oh.

00:22:47.241 --> 00:22:48.741
So, who's coming to dinner?

00:22:48.742 --> 00:22:51.286
Let's just say, if the
evening is a success...

00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:54.361
we can put this whole
"biting" business behind us.

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:03.882
The Petersons! Welcome.

00:23:03.883 --> 00:23:05.133
So, he's literally a dog.

00:23:05.134 --> 00:23:06.384
Paul!

00:23:06.385 --> 00:23:07.552
No, that's all right.

00:23:07.553 --> 00:23:10.346
Although, I prefer "literate dog."

00:23:10.347 --> 00:23:11.639
That's funny.

00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:13.057
Isn't that funny, Paul?

00:23:14.268 --> 00:23:16.591
He's not a big laugher.

00:23:16.729 --> 00:23:19.105
We're so delighted you could
make it on such short notice.

00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:20.883
Aren't we, Sherman?

00:23:21.150 --> 00:23:23.318
Aren't we, Sherman?

00:23:23.319 --> 00:23:26.821
Yeah, we're interested in what's
going on, that's for sure.

00:23:26.822 --> 00:23:28.823
Say hello to Penny, Sherman.

00:23:28.824 --> 00:23:30.575
Hi, Penny.

00:23:30.576 --> 00:23:32.118
Hello, Sherman.

00:23:32.119 --> 00:23:33.828
Now, why don't you go show Penny

00:23:33.829 --> 00:23:35.580
your mineral collection, Sherman?

00:23:35.581 --> 00:23:37.206
I'm sure she'll find
those new geodes

00:23:37.207 --> 00:23:39.234
of yours fascinating.

00:23:39.585 --> 00:23:41.328
Come on.

00:23:43.339 --> 00:23:46.174
I am so glad you
accepted my invitation.

00:23:46.175 --> 00:23:49.677
Now, the kids can resolve their
differences before Ms. Grunion arrives.

00:23:49.678 --> 00:23:52.096
You're barking up the wrong
tree, mister. In fact...

00:23:52.097 --> 00:23:54.515
if it weren't for Patty, I would
have pressed charges already.

00:23:54.516 --> 00:23:55.975
And I have to tell you, Peabody...

00:23:55.976 --> 00:23:57.560
where my daughter is concerned,

00:23:57.561 --> 00:23:59.187
nothing is more important than...

00:23:59.188 --> 00:24:02.057
Hello. Sure, I'll take a survey.

00:24:10.658 --> 00:24:12.367
Everything going swimmingly?

00:24:12.368 --> 00:24:13.868
Ugh.

00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:16.454
Why didn't you tell me
she was coming over here?

00:24:16.455 --> 00:24:18.706
Because I didn't want you to worry.

00:24:18.707 --> 00:24:21.042
Okay, because I didn't want to
listen to your bellyaching.

00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:23.670
Thank you for your honesty.

00:24:23.671 --> 00:24:24.712
You're welcome.

00:24:24.713 --> 00:24:27.548
I don't know what you think we're
supposed to do in here anyway.

00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:29.133
She hates me.

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.344
Share your interests.
Tell a witty anecdote.

00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:32.553
Mr. Peabody...

00:24:32.554 --> 00:24:34.138
I hate her.

00:24:34.139 --> 00:24:36.182
Sherman,
every great relationship...

00:24:36.183 --> 00:24:37.684
starts from a place of conflict,

00:24:37.685 --> 00:24:39.462
and evolves into something richer.

00:24:40.813 --> 00:24:42.556
Bonne chance.

00:24:43.357 --> 00:24:45.054
Make it work.

00:24:45.317 --> 00:24:47.310
But don't tell her about the WABAC.

00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:54.151
Don't even think about it.

00:24:54.243 --> 00:24:56.145
Ah.

00:25:07.923 --> 00:25:10.091
Peabody, that was amazing!

00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:12.093
Paul, wasn't that amazing?

00:25:12.094 --> 00:25:13.469
I'm more into rock-'n'-roll.

00:25:19.393 --> 00:25:20.852
I meant flamenco.

00:25:27.735 --> 00:25:29.136
Bagpipes?

00:25:29.737 --> 00:25:31.434
Uh, didgeridoo.

00:25:34.616 --> 00:25:35.908
Sitar.

00:25:35.909 --> 00:25:37.243
Steel drums.

00:25:37.244 --> 00:25:38.453
Trombone.

00:25:38.454 --> 00:25:39.912
Xylophone.

00:25:39.913 --> 00:25:41.080
DJembe?

00:25:41.081 --> 00:25:42.290
Calliope.

00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:43.916
Oboe. Piccolo.

00:25:43.917 --> 00:25:45.543
Tuba. Dobro.

00:25:45.544 --> 00:25:46.878
Slide whistle. Yodeling.

00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:48.087
Hurdy-gurdy. Ocarina.

00:25:48.088 --> 00:25:49.464
Harmonium. Musical saw.

00:25:49.465 --> 00:25:51.466
You know what?
This has been great...

00:25:51.467 --> 00:25:53.718
but a complete waste of time.

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:56.471
Now, let's get Penny and go home!

00:25:56.472 --> 00:25:57.638
Are you all right, Paul?

00:25:57.639 --> 00:26:00.433
I'm... fine.

00:26:00.434 --> 00:26:02.060
This happens whenever he's tense.

00:26:02.061 --> 00:26:03.144
Paul, if I might...

00:26:03.145 --> 00:26:04.437
Stay away from me, Peabody!

00:26:04.438 --> 00:26:06.981
Just get back! I need traction.

00:26:06.982 --> 00:26:10.151
You can trust me, Paul.
I'm a licensed chiropractor.

00:26:10.152 --> 00:26:11.652
Ow! Huh.

00:26:19.495 --> 00:26:22.148
Ooh...

00:26:22.748 --> 00:26:24.650
Ah...

00:26:24.666 --> 00:26:26.167
Peabody...

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:27.543
I feel great.

00:26:27.544 --> 00:26:30.505
I... I really feel great!

00:26:30.506 --> 00:26:33.159
Peabody, you're a miracle worker.

00:26:34.009 --> 00:26:36.135
Ha-ha! Look at me!

00:26:36.136 --> 00:26:38.083
I'm dancing!

00:26:39.848 --> 00:26:41.015
You know, Penny...

00:26:41.016 --> 00:26:43.643
Sigmund Freud says
if you don't like a person...

00:26:43.644 --> 00:26:47.480
it's because they remind you of something
you don't like about yourself.

00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:49.440
What do you know
about Sigmund Freud?

00:26:49.441 --> 00:26:50.691
More than you think.

00:26:50.692 --> 00:26:53.319
Sure. Just like you
know all that stuff...

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.031
about George Washington not really
cutting down the cherry tree.

00:26:57.032 --> 00:26:58.366
Ugh. What a crock.

00:26:58.367 --> 00:26:59.534
But it's true!

00:26:59.535 --> 00:27:01.327
- How do you know?
- I just know!

00:27:01.328 --> 00:27:02.870
- Did you read it in a book?
- No!

00:27:02.871 --> 00:27:04.163
- See it in a movie?
- No!

00:27:04.164 --> 00:27:05.289
Did your brainiac dad tell you?

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:06.457
No!

00:27:06.458 --> 00:27:07.667
So, how do you know, Sherman?

00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:09.043
How do you know?

00:27:09.044 --> 00:27:10.294
He told me.

00:27:10.295 --> 00:27:11.420
Who told you?

00:27:11.421 --> 00:27:13.368
George Washington.

00:27:14.716 --> 00:27:16.538
George Washington?

00:27:17.553 --> 00:27:19.205
Yeah.

00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:20.793
Ugh! Liar.

00:27:23.892 --> 00:27:26.135
But don't tell her about the WABAC.

00:27:26.895 --> 00:27:28.646
He calls it the "WABAC."

00:27:28.647 --> 00:27:30.565
So, where have you gone in it?

00:27:30.566 --> 00:27:33.192
Not "where," Penny, "when."

00:27:33.193 --> 00:27:35.862
Okay, smart guy, when?

00:27:35.863 --> 00:27:40.700
Oh, 1965,1776, 1620...

00:27:40.701 --> 00:27:44.579
1492, 1215, 4.

00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:46.706
- Can it go back to an hour ago?
- Why?

00:27:46.707 --> 00:27:49.208
Because I could take it home,
pretend to be sick...

00:27:49.209 --> 00:27:51.169
and not come to
this lame dinner party.

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:54.380
Ha-ha. Mr. Peabody says you
should never use the WABAC...

00:27:54.381 --> 00:27:56.591
to travel to
a time when you existed.

00:27:56.592 --> 00:27:57.717
How come?

00:27:57.718 --> 00:27:58.759
There would be two of you.

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:00.761
Oh, yeah.

00:28:00.762 --> 00:28:02.914
I guess the world's
not ready for that.

00:28:06.268 --> 00:28:08.090
Wow.

00:28:08.604 --> 00:28:11.898
Um, well, now that we've seen
it, maybe we should go back.

00:28:11.899 --> 00:28:15.109
Are you kidding?
Where should we go first?

00:28:15.110 --> 00:28:18.946
Mr. Peabody says I'm not allowed
to drive it till I'm older.

00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:21.365
Do you do everything
Mr. Peabody says?

00:28:21.366 --> 00:28:22.617
Yeah.

00:28:22.618 --> 00:28:24.577
You know what that
makes you, Sherman.

00:28:24.578 --> 00:28:26.579
An obedient son?

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.788
Nope.

00:28:27.789 --> 00:28:29.486
A dog.

00:28:42.304 --> 00:28:44.547
- Ooh!
- Nice control.

00:28:44.973 --> 00:28:47.000
- Look at him go!
- Take it, Patty!

00:28:47.768 --> 00:28:49.268
- Heads up, Paul!
- Whoa!

00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:51.646
Here you go. Zing!

00:28:55.817 --> 00:28:57.969
Oh, yeah.

00:28:58.403 --> 00:29:00.154
- Oh!
- Hey, look at that.

00:29:00.155 --> 00:29:02.148
This is fun!

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.030
This is a little homespun
concoction I like to call...

00:29:08.997 --> 00:29:10.665
"Einstein on the Beach."

00:29:10.666 --> 00:29:12.318
Yummy.

00:29:14.419 --> 00:29:15.670
To the kids.

00:29:15.671 --> 00:29:17.869
To the kids!

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:20.091
Mr. Peabody.

00:29:20.092 --> 00:29:21.425
Sherman?

00:29:21.426 --> 00:29:22.677
Can I talk to you a second?

00:29:22.678 --> 00:29:23.928
Of course.

00:29:23.929 --> 00:29:25.706
Excuse me.

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:31.602
I've really hit it off
with Penny's parents.

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:34.814
I think we can file this night
under "Unqualified Success."

00:29:34.815 --> 00:29:37.692
Uh, I would hold off
filing it just yet.

00:29:37.693 --> 00:29:40.194
What do you mean? Where's Penny?

00:29:40.195 --> 00:29:42.280
Uh... Ancient Egypt.

00:29:42.281 --> 00:29:44.657
You used the WABAC?

00:29:45.867 --> 00:29:48.286
What's happening, big guy?
We're running low.

00:29:50.998 --> 00:29:53.165
I'll be right there, Paul.

00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:54.417
How could you do such a thing?

00:29:54.418 --> 00:29:55.626
She called me a liar...

00:29:55.627 --> 00:29:56.836
for saying George Washington

00:29:56.837 --> 00:29:58.796
never cut down a cherry tree.

00:29:58.797 --> 00:30:01.215
So, you took her
to see George Washington?

00:30:01.216 --> 00:30:03.384
Yeah. She was into it.

00:30:03.385 --> 00:30:05.052
Hey, Pea-buddy.

00:30:05.053 --> 00:30:06.178
Hey.

00:30:06.179 --> 00:30:07.221
Where's Penny?

00:30:07.222 --> 00:30:08.848
- Playing hide-and-seek.
- Pooping.

00:30:08.849 --> 00:30:11.092
- Pooping.
- Playing hide and seek.

00:30:12.352 --> 00:30:14.550
- Well, which is it?
- Uh...

00:30:14.896 --> 00:30:16.355
Hey, what's going on here?

00:30:16.356 --> 00:30:18.190
Yeah. What's going on here?

00:30:18.191 --> 00:30:19.650
- What have you done with Penny?
- Penny?

00:30:19.651 --> 00:30:21.319
Penny? Penny!

00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.487
- Oh, my gosh!
- Where's our daughter?

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:26.157
It's hard to say, Paul.

00:30:26.158 --> 00:30:31.245
She could be here, or here,
or here, or here...

00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:32.863
or here.

00:30:34.374 --> 00:30:35.833
That will hold them.

00:30:35.834 --> 00:30:37.251
I learned that trick from a swami

00:30:37.252 --> 00:30:38.669
at the Begawan Giri in Ubud, Bali.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:40.413
Let's go!

00:30:54.061 --> 00:30:57.104
Ancient Egypt.
Land of the Pharaohs.

00:30:57.105 --> 00:31:00.107
A beacon of progress
on the horizon of humanity...

00:31:00.108 --> 00:31:03.944
but a cruel and barbarous
civilization just the same.

00:31:03.945 --> 00:31:07.349
I just hope Penny isn't
suffering too badly.

00:31:18.794 --> 00:31:20.378
I got it.

00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:21.754
What are you doing here?

00:31:21.755 --> 00:31:24.032
We have come to take you home.

00:31:24.299 --> 00:31:26.592
Ugh! What's the Egyptian word
for "tattletale"?

00:31:27.886 --> 00:31:30.763
But that's beside the point. Get
your clothes on, we're going home.

00:31:30.764 --> 00:31:32.973
Who died and made you Pharaoh?

00:31:32.974 --> 00:31:35.297
Now, bring on the mani-pedi.

00:31:35.435 --> 00:31:38.270
See, Mr. Peabody? Impossible!

00:31:38.271 --> 00:31:40.147
Indeed, but watch what happens...

00:31:40.148 --> 00:31:43.802
when an immovable object
meets an irresistible force.

00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.985
Penny...

00:31:44.986 --> 00:31:47.279
come here, right now. Penny, come!

00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:49.156
I'm not Penny anymore.

00:31:49.157 --> 00:31:53.828
Now, I'm Princess Hatsheput,
precious flower of the Nile.

00:31:53.829 --> 00:31:55.037
"Precious," perhaps,
but if you think

00:31:55.038 --> 00:31:56.330
"we're going to leave you here...

00:31:56.331 --> 00:31:58.666
you are most
definitely in "de-Nile."

00:32:00.252 --> 00:32:01.502
I don't get it.

00:32:01.503 --> 00:32:02.670
Now, come along.

00:32:02.671 --> 00:32:04.368
Unhand her!

00:32:05.132 --> 00:32:07.800
What's the matter, my sweet
little desert blossom?

00:32:07.801 --> 00:32:10.177
Are these barbarians bothering you?

00:32:10.178 --> 00:32:12.930
As a matter of fact, they are.

00:32:12.931 --> 00:32:14.515
Bow, barbarians.

00:32:14.516 --> 00:32:16.684
As you wish, Your Highness.

00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:18.686
Who's that, Mr. Peabody?

00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:21.272
That, Sherman, is
the living image ofAmun...

00:32:21.273 --> 00:32:24.525
son of Akhenaten, lord of the 18th
Dynasty of the New Kingdom...

00:32:24.526 --> 00:32:25.818
King Tutankhamun.

00:32:25.819 --> 00:32:27.695
Otherwise known as "King Tut."

00:32:27.696 --> 00:32:28.863
My boyfriend.

00:32:28.864 --> 00:32:31.699
- King Tut is your boyfriend?
- Mmm-hmm.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:34.201
Would you like me to have them
skinned, covered with honey...

00:32:34.202 --> 00:32:36.900
and laid in a pit of fire ants?

00:32:37.205 --> 00:32:38.789
You would do that for me?

00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:42.042
Anything, my desert flower.
Consider it a wedding gift.

00:32:42.043 --> 00:32:44.587
What? You can't marry this guy!

00:32:44.588 --> 00:32:45.713
Why not?

00:32:45.714 --> 00:32:48.674
Well, for one, his name
rhymes with "butt."

00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:51.802
I don't care. I'm gonna have a
big, fat, Egyptian wedding.

00:32:51.803 --> 00:32:54.221
Spoiler alert, King Tut dies young.

00:32:54.222 --> 00:32:56.223
Are you sure you've
thought this through?

00:32:56.224 --> 00:32:58.726
Oh, trust me, I've thought it through.
I'm getting everything.

00:32:58.727 --> 00:33:00.853
The royal astronomers
have decreed...

00:33:00.854 --> 00:33:03.856
the wedding must take
place tomorrow at dawn.

00:33:03.857 --> 00:33:04.982
Who is he?

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:06.358
- He is Ay.
- He is you?

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:09.570
I am Ay. The Grand Vizier.

00:33:09.571 --> 00:33:11.655
- Yeah, that's his name.
- Oh.

00:33:11.656 --> 00:33:14.867
Oh, Grand Vizier, would you mind
telling the precious princess, here...

00:33:14.868 --> 00:33:17.578
precisely what it means
to marry the young Pharaoh.

00:33:17.579 --> 00:33:18.746
Gladly.

00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:22.082
It means she will be bound
to him in eternity...

00:33:22.083 --> 00:33:23.834
through the sacred ceremonies

00:33:23.835 --> 00:33:27.087
of disembowelment
and mummification...

00:33:27.088 --> 00:33:29.423
as described in the holy texts.

00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:30.925
Um, hold up a second.

00:33:30.926 --> 00:33:32.760
Can you walk me
through that, somebody?

00:33:32.761 --> 00:33:36.013
What he means, Penny, is that
when I die they'll kill you, too.

00:33:36.014 --> 00:33:38.849
And then they'll rip out your organs,
stuff them in canopic jars...

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:40.559
and then mummify whatever is left.

00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:41.769
Okay, I'm seeing this now.

00:33:41.770 --> 00:33:44.688
Thank you. I'm going to go with them.

00:33:44.689 --> 00:33:47.900
There's no turning back now.

00:33:47.901 --> 00:33:49.068
To the palace!

00:33:49.069 --> 00:33:51.312
Let the wedding preparations begin!

00:33:51.404 --> 00:33:53.697
Mr. Peabody! Sherman!

00:33:53.698 --> 00:33:54.865
Do something!

00:33:54.866 --> 00:33:56.033
Don't worry, Penny!

00:33:56.034 --> 00:33:57.606
We'll save you!

00:34:01.706 --> 00:34:03.699
Hey, wait! You can't just...

00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:06.574
leave us here.

00:34:06.628 --> 00:34:07.962
Mr. Peabody?

00:34:07.963 --> 00:34:09.171
Yes, Sherman?

00:34:09.172 --> 00:34:10.464
Can I hold your hand?

00:34:10.465 --> 00:34:12.341
Of course you can.

00:34:12.342 --> 00:34:14.969
Boy, your hand
is cold, Mr. Peabody.

00:34:14.970 --> 00:34:16.872
- Sherman?
- Yeah?

00:34:17.973 --> 00:34:19.374
That's not my hand.

00:34:25.355 --> 00:34:27.147
That's disarming.

00:34:27.148 --> 00:34:30.150
Now, to find a way out of here.

00:34:30.151 --> 00:34:31.318
Yuck!

00:34:31.319 --> 00:34:32.820
Look around, Sherman.

00:34:32.821 --> 00:34:35.155
These tombs are lined
with hieroglyphics...

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:37.408
designed to assist
the pharaohs' souls

00:34:37.409 --> 00:34:39.702
in their journey to the afterlife.

00:34:39.703 --> 00:34:43.232
And they may assist us as well.

00:34:44.833 --> 00:34:46.500
Oh, this depicts the god Anubis

00:34:46.501 --> 00:34:48.752
sailing the boat of Ra
to the underworld.

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:52.381
It appears the boats of Ra
are the key to our escape.

00:34:52.382 --> 00:34:54.675
We must find them in time
to stop the wedding.

00:34:54.676 --> 00:34:57.386
Well, if you ask me, we should
let her marry that guy.

00:34:57.387 --> 00:34:58.721
They deserve each other.

00:34:58.722 --> 00:35:00.055
What's that, Sherman?

00:35:00.056 --> 00:35:01.682
Tut? Give me a break.

00:35:01.683 --> 00:35:05.060
Bald, wears a skirt, and makeup.

00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:07.771
If I didn't know any better, Sherman,
I would say you were jealous.

00:35:07.772 --> 00:35:09.732
Jealous? Of what?

00:35:09.733 --> 00:35:11.692
Tut's affection
for Penny, of course.

00:35:11.693 --> 00:35:13.360
You think I like Penny?

00:35:13.361 --> 00:35:14.737
Mmm-hmm.

00:35:14.738 --> 00:35:16.030
Give me a break!

00:35:16.031 --> 00:35:20.868
It's not like I want to hold
her hand, or go to the park...

00:35:20.869 --> 00:35:24.113
or watch her while
she's brushing her hair.

00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:28.417
Or anything.

00:35:28.418 --> 00:35:29.944
Hmm.

00:35:30.837 --> 00:35:32.705
A-ha!

00:35:34.924 --> 00:35:36.871
Quickly, Sherman.

00:35:39.763 --> 00:35:42.306
Ah, ah, ah! Careful, Sherman.

00:35:42.307 --> 00:35:44.016
It's a booby trap.

00:35:44.017 --> 00:35:46.352
What's so funny?

00:35:46.353 --> 00:35:48.130
You said "booby."

00:35:49.814 --> 00:35:52.717
One wrong step and we're done for.

00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:55.319
"The boat...

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:58.223
"of Ra sails straight...

00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.406
"to day.

00:35:59.407 --> 00:36:03.118
"Take the wrong boat...

00:36:03.119 --> 00:36:04.578
man will pay."

00:36:04.579 --> 00:36:06.121
All right, Sherman,
now it's your turn.

00:36:06.122 --> 00:36:08.749
Do the puzzle exactly as I did.

00:36:08.750 --> 00:36:09.875
Huh?

00:36:09.876 --> 00:36:11.903
Think it through,
one step at a time.

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:17.966
The boat of Ra sails straight...

00:36:17.967 --> 00:36:19.368
play.

00:36:19.928 --> 00:36:21.178
Uh, I mean, "pay."

00:36:21.179 --> 00:36:22.671
Oh, my.

00:36:25.767 --> 00:36:27.384
Uh-Oh.

00:36:29.646 --> 00:36:31.093
Run!

00:36:36.152 --> 00:36:37.861
The boats of Ra!

00:36:37.862 --> 00:36:39.947
One boat is the way out,
the other will send us...

00:36:39.948 --> 00:36:41.699
plunging into darkness
and certain death.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:43.200
What?

00:36:43.201 --> 00:36:44.368
Sherman, get in the boat.

00:36:44.369 --> 00:36:47.454
As soon as I move these blocks together,
it's going to move very fast.

00:36:47.455 --> 00:36:48.664
Which boat, Mr. Peabody?

00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:49.873
What?

00:36:49.874 --> 00:36:52.626
Which boat is the "not-certain-
death-plunge" boat?

00:36:52.627 --> 00:36:54.199
That one!

00:37:07.475 --> 00:37:08.726
We did it, Sherman!

00:37:08.727 --> 00:37:09.893
Sherman?

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.729
Mr. Peabody!

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:13.188
What are you doing over there?

00:37:13.189 --> 00:37:15.808
I thought you pointed to this one!

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.062
Ahhh!

00:37:40.842 --> 00:37:43.051
Sherman? Sherman?

00:37:43.052 --> 00:37:44.920
Are you all right?

00:37:45.221 --> 00:37:47.248
I'm good.

00:37:59.778 --> 00:38:01.695
The sun god, Ra...

00:38:01.696 --> 00:38:06.366
commands us to begin
the sacred ceremony!

00:38:16.419 --> 00:38:20.214
Bring forth the blade
for the blood oath.

00:38:24.219 --> 00:38:29.375
Where blade meets flesh
in this sacred rite...

00:38:31.601 --> 00:38:33.060
we pay tribute...

00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:35.634
to the sun god, Ra!

00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:37.356
Wait!

00:38:38.942 --> 00:38:40.067
Anubis!

00:38:40.068 --> 00:38:41.401
The god of death!

00:38:41.402 --> 00:38:43.737
The wedding must not continue.

00:38:43.738 --> 00:38:45.781
Why, Anubis, why?

00:38:45.782 --> 00:38:48.617
Plagues. Plagues!

00:38:48.618 --> 00:38:50.953
If this marriage pact is sealed...

00:38:50.954 --> 00:38:54.957
I will shower down upon the
land uncountable plagues.

00:38:54.958 --> 00:38:56.625
Oy, again with the plagues!

00:38:56.626 --> 00:38:58.794
Why did I ever move to Egypt?

00:38:58.795 --> 00:39:02.089
But, Anubis, the sun
god, Ra, has decreed...

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:05.133
that this girl is to be
the boy-king's wife.

00:39:05.134 --> 00:39:06.760
That's so funny.

00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:10.138
I was talking to the sun god,
Ra, just the other day...

00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:12.850
and he told me he changed his mind.

00:39:12.851 --> 00:39:13.934
Really?

00:39:13.935 --> 00:39:18.021
Old "Flip-Flop Ra," we call
him here in the underworld.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:21.596
But it's too late. We've
already paid for the catering.

00:39:22.819 --> 00:39:26.280
Too bad! You're going
to lose your deposit.

00:39:28.658 --> 00:39:32.286
More smoke, Sherman. This
canine subterfuge is working.

00:39:32.287 --> 00:39:33.620
Deliver the girl...

00:39:33.621 --> 00:39:36.665
to the gates of the city,
and leave her there...

00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:39.960
where the gods
will retrieve her forthwith.

00:39:39.961 --> 00:39:44.131
Only in this manner may the plagues
upon this land be avoided.

00:39:44.132 --> 00:39:46.534
The girl must go!

00:39:47.594 --> 00:39:48.719
Ow!

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:50.637
Anubis has spoken!

00:39:50.638 --> 00:39:52.973
Take this girl to the gates!

00:39:52.974 --> 00:39:54.308
Ow.

00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.190
Anubis, you sound unwell.

00:40:02.191 --> 00:40:04.860
Well, I have been feeling
a little under the weather...

00:40:04.861 --> 00:40:07.889
but I'm feeling much better now.

00:40:08.197 --> 00:40:09.814
Thank you.

00:40:11.409 --> 00:40:13.482
Phew! Huh?

00:40:20.668 --> 00:40:22.544
Penny, Sherman, quickly.

00:40:22.545 --> 00:40:23.712
Come on, Penny.

00:40:23.713 --> 00:40:25.285
Sherman!

00:40:26.674 --> 00:40:28.467
Ah!

00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:32.220
Runaway bride!

00:40:32.221 --> 00:40:34.168
Stop them, you fools!

00:40:36.809 --> 00:40:38.210
Ah!

00:40:53.743 --> 00:40:56.271
Penny, Sherman, climb aboard.

00:40:57.038 --> 00:40:58.906
Whoo-hoo!

00:41:06.214 --> 00:41:08.616
They're getting away!

00:41:08.883 --> 00:41:10.284
Ah!

00:41:19.018 --> 00:41:21.091
Whoa!

00:41:23.898 --> 00:41:26.016
I got it.

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.611
Whoo-hoo! We made it.

00:41:29.612 --> 00:41:31.613
- Where do we go next, Mr. Peabody?
- Home.

00:41:31.614 --> 00:41:33.407
We've got to get back
to the dinner party...

00:41:33.408 --> 00:41:35.450
before Penny's parents
realize she's missing.

00:41:35.451 --> 00:41:37.953
We don't have to
mention the whole...

00:41:37.954 --> 00:41:39.913
uh, King Tut wedding thing, right?

00:41:39.914 --> 00:41:41.248
Certainly not.

00:41:41.249 --> 00:41:43.083
Anyway, as far as I'm concerned,

00:41:43.084 --> 00:41:44.960
they get married too
young in Ancient Egypt.

00:41:44.961 --> 00:41:48.240
Or, perhaps,
I'm just some old "Giza."

00:41:49.716 --> 00:41:51.008
Huh?

00:41:52.093 --> 00:41:53.540
Warning.

00:41:53.636 --> 00:41:55.929
WABAC power supply insufficient.

00:41:55.930 --> 00:41:58.515
Charge now. Warning.

00:41:58.516 --> 00:42:00.267
Uh, what's the matter, Mr. Peabody?

00:42:00.268 --> 00:42:03.145
All this zipping about the cosmos
has drained our power supply.

00:42:03.146 --> 00:42:05.564
We're going to have to
make an unscheduled stop.

00:42:05.565 --> 00:42:06.773
As luck would have it...

00:42:06.774 --> 00:42:09.268
we have just enough power to
make it to the Renaissance.

00:42:21.956 --> 00:42:25.625
I can't even tell my left
brain from my right anymore!

00:42:25.626 --> 00:42:27.794
How many times I got to
tell you, Mona Lisa?

00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:28.837
Mona Lisa?

00:42:28.838 --> 00:42:31.131
I can't paint the picture...

00:42:31.132 --> 00:42:33.216
until you smile!

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:36.970
Leonardo, tell me one thing
I have to smile about.

00:42:36.971 --> 00:42:38.889
The sunshine, the pasta.

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.893
All the things that make Italy such
a popular tourist destination!

00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:45.854
But I have not seen any
of them, Leonardo!

00:42:45.855 --> 00:42:49.555
Because I'm sitting here
all day on my abbondanza!

00:42:49.984 --> 00:42:52.819
I don't think that means
"chair" in Italian.

00:42:52.820 --> 00:42:56.156
Ah, Peabody, my old friend.

00:42:56.157 --> 00:42:58.742
What a welcome interruption!

00:42:58.743 --> 00:43:02.496
Believe you me, this
woman is making me nuts.

00:43:02.497 --> 00:43:04.247
So, how you been?

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:06.208
Good to see you. What do you want?

00:43:06.209 --> 00:43:08.126
We're in a desperate
hurry to get home,

00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:10.045
but the WABAC needs a jump start...

00:43:10.046 --> 00:43:12.464
and we thought, who better than

00:43:12.465 --> 00:43:14.841
Leonardo da Vinci to
help us on our way?

00:43:14.842 --> 00:43:17.385
Peabody, I would love to help you,

00:43:17.386 --> 00:43:19.930
but you come at a very bad time.

00:43:19.931 --> 00:43:23.183
I don't know what I'm going
to do with this crazy woman.

00:43:24.560 --> 00:43:25.727
You see what I mean?

00:43:25.728 --> 00:43:26.937
What seems to be the problem?

00:43:26.938 --> 00:43:28.438
"What is the problem?"

00:43:28.439 --> 00:43:31.191
I am halfway done with the
painting, she won't even smile.

00:43:31.192 --> 00:43:34.471
Fine. I smile.

00:43:36.531 --> 00:43:39.032
No! That's a fake smile!

00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:40.534
Everybody knows that!

00:43:40.535 --> 00:43:42.953
Why don't you make it a real smile?

00:43:42.954 --> 00:43:44.579
Why don't you say something funny?

00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:46.206
I paint the paintings.

00:43:46.207 --> 00:43:48.208
I make the machines.

00:43:48.209 --> 00:43:51.128
I don't tell the jokes!

00:43:51.129 --> 00:43:53.880
Perhaps, I can be
of assistance. You see...

00:43:53.881 --> 00:43:56.091
humor is not immune
to the laws of science.

00:43:56.092 --> 00:43:58.009
Using algorithms,
we can extrapolate

00:43:58.010 --> 00:43:59.928
what is universally
considered "funny"...

00:43:59.929 --> 00:44:02.180
thus producing a formula that is

00:44:02.181 --> 00:44:04.629
scientifically
certain to cause laughter.

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:07.636
Case in point, the pratfall.

00:44:13.067 --> 00:44:15.686
Is everyone amused?

00:44:17.238 --> 00:44:18.572
Hmm.

00:44:18.573 --> 00:44:20.323
The data was so clear. Ooh!

00:44:20.324 --> 00:44:21.783
Don't worry, Mr. Peabody.

00:44:21.784 --> 00:44:23.201
- I got it!
- Sherman... Ahh!

00:44:23.202 --> 00:44:25.775
Oh!

00:44:38.759 --> 00:44:40.260
Hold that smile!

00:44:40.261 --> 00:44:42.663
Hold it right there!
No move! No move!

00:44:50.313 --> 00:44:53.190
Well, Leo, if my
calculations are correct...

00:44:53.191 --> 00:44:55.984
this machine of ours should generate
enough centrifugal force...

00:44:55.985 --> 00:44:57.360
to send us home.

00:44:57.361 --> 00:44:59.946
I got one last piece
I gotta pound in place.

00:44:59.947 --> 00:45:03.283
Sherman, why don't you fetch
the hammer for Mr. Da Vinci?

00:45:03.284 --> 00:45:05.527
Okay, Mr. Peabody.

00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:10.999
Mr. Peabody!

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.292
Well done, Sherman.

00:45:12.293 --> 00:45:13.460
But, Mr. Peabody!

00:45:13.461 --> 00:45:15.204
Very helpful.

00:45:29.310 --> 00:45:30.882
Sherman!

00:45:30.978 --> 00:45:32.880
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

00:45:33.189 --> 00:45:34.806
The hammer.

00:45:34.899 --> 00:45:36.191
Da Vinci.

00:45:36.192 --> 00:45:39.015
Oh. Okay, Mr. Peabody.

00:45:39.987 --> 00:45:42.060
Oh!

00:45:42.490 --> 00:45:44.074
- Here you go, Mr. Da Vinci.
- Ahh!

00:45:44.075 --> 00:45:45.325
Do you need any help?

00:45:45.326 --> 00:45:47.327
No, no. That's quite all right.

00:45:47.328 --> 00:45:49.230
Thank you.

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:50.981
Psst! Sherman.

00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:53.738
- Huh?
- Let's go. Let's go explore.

00:45:54.001 --> 00:45:56.169
Uh, well, I'm supposed to be having

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:58.380
father-son time with Mr. Peabody.

00:45:58.381 --> 00:46:00.215
Wouldn't you rather
have fun with me?

00:46:00.216 --> 00:46:01.591
Uh...

00:46:01.592 --> 00:46:02.717
Okay.

00:46:02.718 --> 00:46:03.927
Sherman...

00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:05.178
where are you going?

00:46:05.179 --> 00:46:06.429
Exploring.

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:07.722
But we need your help.

00:46:07.723 --> 00:46:10.392
No, we don't!
I mean, we can manage.

00:46:10.393 --> 00:46:11.919
Somehow.

00:46:12.103 --> 00:46:13.561
He's a boy, Peabody.

00:46:13.562 --> 00:46:16.356
Let him have his fun. Let him go.

00:46:16.357 --> 00:46:18.430
Thanks, Mr. Peabody!

00:46:21.612 --> 00:46:23.905
He's growing up, Peabody.

00:46:23.906 --> 00:46:27.200
Like a baby bird leaving the nest.

00:46:27.201 --> 00:46:29.945
Isn't it wonderful?

00:46:36.544 --> 00:46:39.117
It's like a museum.

00:46:39.547 --> 00:46:42.450
It's like a toy store.

00:46:46.887 --> 00:46:48.960
Wow.

00:46:52.393 --> 00:46:53.727
Check this out.

00:46:53.728 --> 00:46:56.396
It's the world's
biggest model airplane.

00:46:56.397 --> 00:46:59.232
It's not a model, Penny.
It's a prototype.

00:46:59.233 --> 00:47:02.360
And we should probably
just leave that alone.

00:47:02.361 --> 00:47:03.403
Okay.

00:47:03.404 --> 00:47:05.655
But wouldn't it be cool
if we could fly it?

00:47:05.656 --> 00:47:07.824
I don't think
Mr. Peabody would like that.

00:47:07.825 --> 00:47:10.076
Well, Mr. Peabody isn't here.

00:47:10.077 --> 00:47:11.786
Just tell me how it works.

00:47:11.787 --> 00:47:13.246
Please?

00:47:13.247 --> 00:47:14.581
For learning.

00:47:14.582 --> 00:47:16.700
Oh. Okay.

00:47:17.084 --> 00:47:20.420
The thrust comes from this kind
of crossbow doohickey here.

00:47:20.421 --> 00:47:24.591
Then it shoots along the track
until the wind catches the wings.

00:47:24.592 --> 00:47:26.509
- But how does it go?
- Huh?

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:28.094
How do you take off?

00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:30.589
Oh, you just pull down that lever.

00:47:31.432 --> 00:47:32.849
This one?

00:47:32.850 --> 00:47:34.059
Oh, boy.

00:47:34.060 --> 00:47:36.007
Ah!

00:47:38.022 --> 00:47:41.471
Wow! Whoo-hoo!

00:47:42.651 --> 00:47:44.444
This is crazy!

00:47:44.445 --> 00:47:46.863
No, it's not Sherman. It's fun!

00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:48.323
We're gonna die!

00:47:48.324 --> 00:47:51.242
Oh, stop being such a party
pooper and enjoy it!

00:47:56.457 --> 00:47:57.791
Ah...

00:47:57.792 --> 00:48:00.794
Nothing is as beautiful
as an elegant equation...

00:48:00.795 --> 00:48:03.630
translated into
perfect engineering.

00:48:03.631 --> 00:48:05.799
Why can't children be so simple?

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:08.968
Because children
are not machines, Peabody.

00:48:08.969 --> 00:48:12.347
Believe me, I tried to build one.

00:48:12.348 --> 00:48:14.876
Oh! It was creepy.

00:48:16.894 --> 00:48:18.686
Here, Sherman! You fly it!

00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:20.146
But I don't want to fly!

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:22.148
Sure you do. It'll be fun!

00:48:22.149 --> 00:48:24.901
No, seriously, Penny,
I don't want to!

00:48:24.902 --> 00:48:26.820
I'm letting go. One...

00:48:26.821 --> 00:48:27.987
Don't let go!

00:48:27.988 --> 00:48:29.072
Two...

00:48:29.073 --> 00:48:30.824
- No!
- Three!

00:48:33.828 --> 00:48:35.400
Penny, fly the plane!

00:48:35.496 --> 00:48:36.746
No, Sherman!

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:37.997
You're going to have to save us!

00:48:37.998 --> 00:48:39.445
But I can't do it!

00:48:39.583 --> 00:48:42.585
I'm serious, Penny.
I don't know how to fly!

00:48:42.586 --> 00:48:44.504
You can do it! I know you can!

00:48:44.505 --> 00:48:45.713
Come on, Sherman.

00:48:45.714 --> 00:48:47.115
Fly!

00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:55.140
Ah!

00:48:59.854 --> 00:49:01.847
Phew!

00:49:12.867 --> 00:49:15.034
See? You got this, Sherman.

00:49:15.035 --> 00:49:18.154
You're right. I have got this.

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:20.607
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

00:49:26.380 --> 00:49:27.964
Da Vinci's at it again!

00:49:27.965 --> 00:49:29.716
You ever see that child he made?

00:49:29.717 --> 00:49:31.217
So creepy.

00:49:31.218 --> 00:49:33.165
Papa. Mama.

00:49:33.971 --> 00:49:35.839
Papa. Mama.

00:50:02.416 --> 00:50:04.000
All done up here, Leonardo.

00:50:04.001 --> 00:50:06.336
And I am all done down here.

00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.254
It is beautiful, isn't it?

00:50:08.255 --> 00:50:12.592
Every piece in its place doing
precisely what it's supposed to do.

00:50:12.593 --> 00:50:14.177
Look, Peabody!

00:50:14.178 --> 00:50:16.262
It's my flying mach...

00:50:16.263 --> 00:50:17.847
MY flying machine?

00:50:17.848 --> 00:50:18.932
Sherman.

00:50:18.933 --> 00:50:20.099
Sherman?

00:50:20.100 --> 00:50:22.519
Sherman, what are
you doing up there?

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:24.103
I'm flying!

00:50:24.104 --> 00:50:26.814
But, Sherman,
you don't know how to fly!

00:50:26.815 --> 00:50:27.941
I don't?

00:50:27.942 --> 00:50:29.108
No!

00:50:35.449 --> 00:50:36.616
Turn!

00:50:36.617 --> 00:50:37.700
Turn, Sherman!

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:40.229
Lean!

00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:45.533
Oh, no!

00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.967
Sherman?

00:50:53.968 --> 00:50:56.344
Sherman! Are you okay?

00:50:56.345 --> 00:50:59.419
That was pretty fantastic!

00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:02.759
Oh! I can't believe it!

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.937
My flying machine! It's work!

00:51:05.938 --> 00:51:10.316
Sherman! You are the
first flying man!

00:51:10.317 --> 00:51:12.360
Oh, you should be
very proud, Peabody.

00:51:12.361 --> 00:51:14.195
Very. Very proud!

00:51:14.196 --> 00:51:16.724
"Proud" doesn't
begin to describe it.

00:51:18.158 --> 00:51:21.061
Leonardo, will you please
fire up the mechanism?

00:51:39.346 --> 00:51:43.099
Papa. Mama.

00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:45.298
Mona!

00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.604
Papa. Mama.

00:51:47.605 --> 00:51:49.006
The kid!

00:52:15.132 --> 00:52:17.884
I'm sorry I broke
the plane, Mr. Peabody.

00:52:17.885 --> 00:52:20.595
Well, you should be.
You could have been killed.

00:52:20.596 --> 00:52:22.096
What are you talking about?

00:52:22.097 --> 00:52:24.932
Sherman flew a plane.
He was amazing!

00:52:24.933 --> 00:52:28.519
Sherman destroyed a priceless
historical artifact.

00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:30.855
Whatever. You should be happy.

00:52:30.856 --> 00:52:33.566
It turns out Sherman is not a
complete and total loser, after all.

00:52:33.567 --> 00:52:34.859
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:37.934
It turns out I'm not a complete
and total loser, after all.

00:52:39.281 --> 00:52:40.406
Ms. Peterson...

00:52:40.407 --> 00:52:43.076
stop turning my son
into a hooligan.

00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:44.535
It's not my fault he's a hooligan.

00:52:44.536 --> 00:52:47.205
Yeah, it's not her
fault I'm a hooligan.

00:52:47.206 --> 00:52:48.748
Well, it's certainly not my fault!

00:52:48.749 --> 00:52:50.291
I've spent the last seven years

00:52:50.292 --> 00:52:51.876
teaching Sherman good judgment.

00:52:51.877 --> 00:52:53.002
If you're such a great parent...

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:55.997
why is Ms. Grunion trying to
take Sherman away from you?

00:52:58.634 --> 00:53:00.301
Is that true?

00:53:00.302 --> 00:53:02.553
Is someone gonna
take me away from you?

00:53:02.554 --> 00:53:05.056
No, Sherman,
I'll never let that happen.

00:53:05.057 --> 00:53:06.808
You just need to trust me.

00:53:06.809 --> 00:53:09.553
Oh, dear, a black hole!

00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:16.401
What's happening?

00:53:16.402 --> 00:53:17.819
If I can't pull us out of here...

00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:21.190
we're going to be smashed to
smithereens on the event horizon.

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:28.988
There's not enough power to
resist the gravitational pull!

00:53:28.997 --> 00:53:31.749
I've got to divert everything
to the reverse thrusters.

00:53:31.750 --> 00:53:32.917
Why didn't you tell me?

00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:34.001
Tell you what?

00:53:34.002 --> 00:53:35.628
Why didn't you tell me Ms. Grunion

00:53:35.629 --> 00:53:37.380
was trying to take
me away from you?

00:53:37.381 --> 00:53:39.298
It's not your job to
worry about these things.

00:53:39.299 --> 00:53:41.008
You just didn't
think I could handle it.

00:53:41.009 --> 00:53:43.261
We'll discuss it later.
Now, sit down.

00:53:43.262 --> 00:53:45.304
I don't want to discuss it later!

00:53:45.305 --> 00:53:46.806
Sherman, sit!

00:53:46.807 --> 00:53:48.891
You can't talk to me like that.

00:53:48.892 --> 00:53:50.309
I'm not a dog.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:51.686
What did you say?

00:53:51.687 --> 00:53:54.510
I said, I'm not a dog!

00:53:54.565 --> 00:53:56.941
You're right, Sherman, you're not.

00:53:56.942 --> 00:53:59.640
You're just a very bad boy!

00:53:59.653 --> 00:54:01.779
T-minus 10...

00:54:01.780 --> 00:54:03.823
Nine, eight...

00:54:03.824 --> 00:54:04.991
Seven...

00:54:04.992 --> 00:54:06.033
Six...

00:54:06.034 --> 00:54:07.326
Five...

00:54:07.327 --> 00:54:09.525
Four, three...

00:54:09.955 --> 00:54:10.830
Two...

00:54:10.831 --> 00:54:12.153
One.

00:54:26.388 --> 00:54:27.880
Sherman?

00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:29.340
Penny?

00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:31.501
Sherman, are you okay?

00:54:34.438 --> 00:54:36.306
Sherman?

00:54:43.322 --> 00:54:45.156
He's gone.

00:54:45.157 --> 00:54:47.434
Where are we, anyway?

00:54:48.368 --> 00:54:50.111
Oh, no.

00:54:50.454 --> 00:54:53.573
We're on the brink of one of history's
most ferocious conflicts...

00:55:08.931 --> 00:55:10.674
Delivery.

00:55:17.981 --> 00:55:20.525
How are we doing, heroes of Greece?

00:55:20.526 --> 00:55:21.943
Feeling good?

00:55:21.944 --> 00:55:23.861
Feeling strong?

00:55:24.947 --> 00:55:26.697
Okay, let's get warmed up!

00:55:26.698 --> 00:55:28.533
We don't want to pull
something out there.

00:55:28.534 --> 00:55:30.535
Remember what happened to Achilles.

00:55:30.536 --> 00:55:32.904
That whole thing with his heel.

00:55:34.414 --> 00:55:36.791
Looking good, Diomedes.

00:55:36.792 --> 00:55:38.793
Menelaus, my man!

00:55:38.794 --> 00:55:40.169
My man.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:42.588
Are you ready to get on
the field, Shermanus?

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:44.924
Sure thing, Mr. Agamemnon.

00:55:46.176 --> 00:55:47.260
That's cute.

00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:50.838
Shh.

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:55.753
Odysseus, what news do you bring?

00:55:55.894 --> 00:55:57.812
Someone left this for us.

00:55:57.813 --> 00:55:59.230
A present. Nice.

00:55:59.231 --> 00:56:01.884
It looks just like our horse.

00:56:02.693 --> 00:56:04.766
Should I bring it inside?

00:56:05.737 --> 00:56:07.480
It would be rude not to.

00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:14.695
I did not see that coming!

00:56:14.788 --> 00:56:18.332
Ugh! Jeez Louise,
what is that smell?

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:20.293
Oh!

00:56:20.294 --> 00:56:22.461
Ooh. That is the smell of victory.

00:56:22.462 --> 00:56:24.922
Yeah! Victory!

00:56:24.923 --> 00:56:27.842
Greetings, men of
Athens, Sparta and Thebes.

00:56:27.843 --> 00:56:29.260
Peabody, here.

00:56:29.261 --> 00:56:31.012
I've come for Sherman.

00:56:31.013 --> 00:56:33.014
- Do you know this guy?
- I thought I did...

00:56:33.015 --> 00:56:34.640
but now I'm not so sure.

00:56:34.641 --> 00:56:36.934
Then he must be a spy. Kill him!

00:56:36.935 --> 00:56:39.258
No! No!

00:56:39.521 --> 00:56:41.981
He's my dad.

00:56:41.982 --> 00:56:43.399
- Your dad?
- Huh?

00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:45.848
It's an adoptive relationship.

00:56:46.194 --> 00:56:47.737
Aw!

00:56:47.738 --> 00:56:50.865
Thank you for taking such good
care of my son, Agamemnon...

00:56:50.866 --> 00:56:53.409
but it's time for him to come home.

00:56:53.410 --> 00:56:56.245
Sorry, Mr. Peabody,
I've joined the Greek army.

00:56:56.246 --> 00:56:57.705
Shermanus is one of us now.

00:56:57.706 --> 00:56:58.998
- He's a brother.
- I'm his brother.

00:56:58.999 --> 00:57:00.082
He's my son.

00:57:00.083 --> 00:57:01.500
- He took an oath.
- I took an oath.

00:57:01.501 --> 00:57:02.618
He's seven!

00:57:02.794 --> 00:57:04.629
And a half!

00:57:04.630 --> 00:57:08.174
All sons must prove
themselves to their fathers.

00:57:08.175 --> 00:57:09.133
Today...

00:57:09.134 --> 00:57:13.596
Shermanus will prove himself
on the field of battle.

00:57:13.597 --> 00:57:14.597
But he's only a child.

00:57:14.598 --> 00:57:17.808
Your dad may not think you're ready
to become a man, Shermanus...

00:57:17.809 --> 00:57:19.018
but we do.

00:57:19.019 --> 00:57:20.061
Yeah!

00:57:20.062 --> 00:57:21.187
Yeah, Mr. Peabody.

00:57:21.188 --> 00:57:23.147
Now, I'll show you
what I can handle.

00:57:23.148 --> 00:57:25.650
FYI, a lot of heroes
have father issues.

00:57:25.651 --> 00:57:27.234
My old man is a minotaur.

00:57:27.235 --> 00:57:30.529
Half man, half bull, all judgment.

00:57:30.530 --> 00:57:32.823
Ajax, here, strongest
guy in the world...

00:57:32.824 --> 00:57:36.535
but his father never accepted
that his real dream was to sing.

00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:38.454
I wanted to be in the Greek chorus.

00:57:38.455 --> 00:57:40.665
Uh, yeah, and don't even get
me started about Oedipus.

00:57:40.666 --> 00:57:42.625
Let's just say that you do not want

00:57:42.626 --> 00:57:44.627
to be at his house
over the holidays.

00:57:44.628 --> 00:57:46.245
It's awkward.

00:57:46.421 --> 00:57:48.297
Sherman, I'm concerned you
haven't thought this through.

00:57:48.298 --> 00:57:51.842
This is war. Do you realize
what's about to happen?

00:57:51.843 --> 00:57:53.469
I'll tell you what's gonna happen.

00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:55.846
We're gonna destroy their houses!

00:57:55.847 --> 00:57:57.348
Pull down their temples!

00:57:57.349 --> 00:58:00.726
And make the streets
of the city run red...

00:58:00.727 --> 00:58:02.728
with Trojan blood!

00:58:02.729 --> 00:58:04.221
Yeah!

00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:08.852
Blood! Blood! Blood!

00:58:17.577 --> 00:58:19.453
Zeus on three! One!

00:58:19.454 --> 00:58:22.289
Sherman, I absolutely forbid you
to fight in the Trojan War.

00:58:22.290 --> 00:58:25.251
It's not fair! All my friends
are fighting in the Trojan War.

00:58:25.252 --> 00:58:27.003
- Two!
- Sherman, it's dangerous.

00:58:27.004 --> 00:58:28.212
I'm wearing a helmet.

00:58:28.213 --> 00:58:29.714
- Three!
- You're not going!

00:58:29.715 --> 00:58:30.881
Oh, yes, I am.

00:58:30.882 --> 00:58:33.000
Zeus!

00:58:33.301 --> 00:58:35.428
Zeus! Zeus!

00:58:37.848 --> 00:58:41.502
Eat my bronze, you Trojan dogs!

00:58:43.145 --> 00:58:45.673
Eat my bronze, you Trojan dog!

00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:49.183
Ahh!

00:58:58.577 --> 00:59:00.570
Well, that's cutting it close.

00:59:02.372 --> 00:59:05.150
This is why I ask you
to obey me, Sherman.

00:59:06.251 --> 00:59:10.406
Because I'm your father, and
it's my job to keep you safe.

00:59:11.298 --> 00:59:14.668
But are you sure Ms. Grunion
won't take me away?

00:59:16.011 --> 00:59:18.288
Not as long as I'm around.

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:31.400
Mr. Peabody!

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:33.303
Help me!

00:59:33.737 --> 00:59:35.138
Penny!

00:59:42.287 --> 00:59:44.246
Smell my victory!

00:59:44.247 --> 00:59:45.873
Smell it!

00:59:45.874 --> 00:59:48.652
Hey! That's my ride!

00:59:55.175 --> 00:59:56.175
Mr. Peabody...

00:59:56.176 --> 00:59:57.828
hurry!

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:01.714
I'll take that.

01:00:49.354 --> 01:00:51.188
You did it, Sherman!

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.439
Mr. Peabody helped.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.108
Now, let's get to
the WABAC, go home,

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.860
un-hypnotize Penny's parents...

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:57.236
finish that dinner party,
eat my Baked Alaska...

01:00:57.237 --> 01:00:58.612
charm the pants off Ms. Grunion...

01:00:58.613 --> 01:01:01.115
and make sure none of this ever
happens in the first place.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:03.075
Sounds good.

01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:04.410
I'm in.

01:01:04.411 --> 01:01:05.983
Ah!

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.277
Sherman!

01:01:09.541 --> 01:01:11.659
- Penny!
- Sherman, no!

01:01:21.678 --> 01:01:23.500
Whoa!

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:31.967
Mr. Peabody...

01:01:32.397 --> 01:01:34.674
Mr. Peabody?

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.385
Mr. Peabody!

01:01:38.737 --> 01:01:41.060
Mr. Peabody!

01:01:42.365 --> 01:01:44.062
Dad!

01:01:54.085 --> 01:01:58.456
Oh, Mr. Peabody! What should
I do? What should I do?

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:04.162
There's nothing
you can do, Sherman.

01:02:06.848 --> 01:02:09.250
I just want to go home.

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:12.587
Home.

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.215
That's it.

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.358
I got an idea.

01:02:17.359 --> 01:02:19.306
Come on!

01:02:20.654 --> 01:02:21.946
Where are we gonna go?

01:02:21.947 --> 01:02:23.280
We're going home.

01:02:23.281 --> 01:02:25.366
There's only one person
who can help us...

01:02:25.367 --> 01:02:27.076
and that's Mr. Peabody.

01:02:27.077 --> 01:02:29.828
What are you talking about?
How is that even possible?

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.247
We've got a time machine, Penny!

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.165
I can set it so that we'll get home

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.376
when Mr. Peabody is still there.

01:02:35.377 --> 01:02:36.752
But I thought you're not supposed

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.128
to go back to a time
when you existed.

01:02:38.129 --> 01:02:40.031
What choice do we have?

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:44.927
Error. You are attempting to
travel to an era in which you exist.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.921
This could alter
the fabric of space-time.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:51.433
Error. Error.

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.336
Hang on!

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.679
This is fun!

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:08.856
This is a little homespun
concoction I like to call...

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.203
"Einstein on the Beach."

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.947
Yummy.

01:03:14.833 --> 01:03:16.125
To the kids.

01:03:16.126 --> 01:03:18.324
To the kids!

01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:20.504
Mr. Peabody.

01:03:20.505 --> 01:03:22.089
Sherman? Penny?

01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:23.590
Can we talk to you a second?

01:03:23.591 --> 01:03:24.550
Of course.

01:03:24.551 --> 01:03:26.248
Excuse me.

01:03:28.513 --> 01:03:30.597
I've really hit it off
with your parents.

01:03:30.598 --> 01:03:33.934
I think we can file this night
under "Unqualified Success."

01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:36.520
I'd hold off filing it just yet.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:37.479
What do you mean?

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:39.982
Why are you two dressed
like ancient Greeks?

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:41.650
- You used the WABAC!
- I did.

01:03:41.651 --> 01:03:43.444
I know, it's terrible!

01:03:43.445 --> 01:03:44.486
But why?

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.697
Penny and I got into an argument
about George Washington.

01:03:46.698 --> 01:03:48.115
So, I made him show me the WABAC.

01:03:48.116 --> 01:03:49.408
And I lost her in ancient Egypt.

01:03:49.409 --> 01:03:50.784
And I got engaged to King Tut.

01:03:50.785 --> 01:03:52.619
- So, I came back and got you.
- Then we ran out of gas.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.413
- In Florence.
- Went into a black hole.

01:03:54.414 --> 01:03:56.165
And then you died in ancient Troy.

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.584
Died? I have a hard
time believing that.

01:03:58.585 --> 01:03:59.585
It's true!

01:03:59.586 --> 01:04:02.212
But now you're here, and
everything's gonna be okay.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.381
I told you never to come back
to a time when you existed...

01:04:04.382 --> 01:04:05.924
because there would be two of you!

01:04:05.925 --> 01:04:08.635
Yeah, but the other one
of me is in ancient Egypt.

01:04:11.139 --> 01:04:13.390
Ahh!

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:14.558
Who are you?

01:04:14.559 --> 01:04:16.393
He's you, but
from another timeline.

01:04:16.394 --> 01:04:19.646
But I thought you said never to come
back to a time when you existed.

01:04:19.647 --> 01:04:21.720
- Exactly!
- I know.

01:04:22.067 --> 01:04:25.736
But what was I supposed to do?
Mr. Peabody died in ancient Troy.

01:04:25.737 --> 01:04:26.653
Died?

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:28.364
I have a hard time believing that.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:29.490
Thank you.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:31.075
What are we going to do?

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:33.410
Well, for starters, both
Shermans can't stay here.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:34.912
Why? We could get bunk beds.

01:04:34.913 --> 01:04:36.121
I was thinking the same thing.

01:04:36.122 --> 01:04:37.831
That's so weird.
It's like we're twins!

01:04:37.832 --> 01:04:39.233
I was thinking that, too!

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.417
Ow!

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:43.462
You see? We can't have two
Shermans in the same timeline.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:47.049
It puts too much strain
on the space-time continuum.

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.967
What to do? The Petersons

01:04:48.968 --> 01:04:50.511
can't know any of this.

01:04:50.512 --> 01:04:52.334
Hey, Pea-buddy.

01:04:52.639 --> 01:04:53.764
Hey.

01:04:53.765 --> 01:04:54.932
How's it going?

01:04:54.933 --> 01:04:57.927
Patty and I are
working up an appetite.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:05:00.270
Mmm. The smells coming from
your kitchen are yummy!

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:02.799
Especially that Baked Alaska.

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:04.525
So, what's going on here?

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.269
Yeah, what's with the getups?

01:05:06.319 --> 01:05:07.903
Toga party!

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:09.738
Toga party?

01:05:09.739 --> 01:05:13.283
Yes, it is a toga party!

01:05:13.284 --> 01:05:14.701
Well, what about dinner?

01:05:14.702 --> 01:05:15.828
I'm starving.

01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:17.162
Why don't we head into
the dining room...

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.248
and tuck into those quails
you've been yakking about?

01:05:19.249 --> 01:05:20.332
- No!
- Why not?

01:05:20.333 --> 01:05:24.461
Because it's so fun right here!

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:27.490
Whoo-hoo!

01:05:34.222 --> 01:05:35.222
Ms. Grunion!

01:05:35.223 --> 01:05:37.099
How delightful.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.934
We were having such a good time...

01:05:38.935 --> 01:05:40.352
- I almost forgot you were coming.
- Oh!

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:42.146
Well, why don't you join the party?

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:45.899
I'm not here for a party. I'm
here for the investigation.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:49.319
Good. Why don't you start
investigating over here?

01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.448
Or here, or here, or here...

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.442
Stop waving your hands around!

01:05:56.995 --> 01:05:57.953
Sherman?

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.872
Wait! Is that...?

01:05:59.873 --> 01:06:01.582
Sherman!

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:04.877
Dos Shermanos? What's
going on here, Peabody?

01:06:04.878 --> 01:06:07.337
Oh...

01:06:07.338 --> 01:06:08.589
Um...

01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:09.923
Nobody move!

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:13.469
Sherman, I've got to get you out
of here before you touch yourself.

01:06:15.263 --> 01:06:17.473
Mr. Peabody! You didn't die!

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.099
Of course I didn't die.

01:06:19.100 --> 01:06:20.392
Thank you.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.436
Hey. How did you get back?

01:06:22.437 --> 01:06:24.229
Well, after a few
failed experiments...

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:26.607
I hit upon a combination of
bones, stone and yak fat...

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:28.775
and constructed
a rudimentary WABAC.

01:06:28.776 --> 01:06:29.902
You know what they say...

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:33.280
"if at first you don't
succeed, Troy, Troy again."

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:36.116
This is no time for puns!
Even good ones.

01:06:36.117 --> 01:06:37.826
Penny, Sherman, quickly!

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:39.786
You're not going anywhere.

01:06:39.787 --> 01:06:42.206
I've seen quite enough
to remove the boy...

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:44.791
both boys, from this home.

01:06:44.792 --> 01:06:47.836
No, don't, Ms. Grunion, please!

01:06:47.837 --> 01:06:51.366
This is all my fault. I started it.

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:54.084
I'm so sorry, Sherman.

01:06:54.802 --> 01:06:57.721
You have nothing
to apologize for, Penny.

01:06:57.722 --> 01:06:59.515
A dog should never
have been allowed

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:01.350
to adopt a boy in the first place.

01:07:01.351 --> 01:07:02.643
Now, come along.

01:07:02.644 --> 01:07:04.512
Ms. Grunion, be careful!

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:06.480
Ah! Oh!

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:07.723
What's happening?

01:07:12.403 --> 01:07:14.655
Mr. Peabody, help!

01:07:14.656 --> 01:07:16.228
- Sherman!
- Sherman!

01:07:19.953 --> 01:07:21.855
Oh!

01:07:29.546 --> 01:07:31.869
Hey! Where did the other two go?

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:36.427
Our cosmic doubles combined in
order to reconcile a paradox...

01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:39.421
in the space-time continuum.

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:41.332
Okay, that makes sense.

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:43.517
I don't know what
just happened here...

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:46.395
but I know it was wrong!

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:48.514
- This boy is coming with me!
- Mr. Peabody!

01:07:48.523 --> 01:07:49.940
- No, Ms. Grunion!
- Ow! Let me go!

01:07:49.941 --> 01:07:51.058
Get back here!

01:07:51.359 --> 01:07:53.761
Ow! Ow! You're hurting me!

01:07:56.364 --> 01:07:58.186
Oh! Oh!

01:08:01.411 --> 01:08:03.905
He bit me!

01:08:04.872 --> 01:08:07.149
He bit me!

01:08:08.334 --> 01:08:10.043
Yes, hello, police.

01:08:10.044 --> 01:08:12.129
I'd like to report an assault.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.297
A bite.

01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:15.549
Mr. Peabody, what are we gonna do?

01:08:15.550 --> 01:08:17.134
Get here as soon as possible.

01:08:17.135 --> 01:08:18.331
Run!

01:08:19.095 --> 01:08:21.122
He's kidnapping the children! Oh!

01:08:23.891 --> 01:08:25.684
I can't believe you
bit her, Mr. Peabody!

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:27.603
I know, Sherman, it was wrong.

01:08:27.604 --> 01:08:28.478
"Wrong"?

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.552
It was awesome!

01:08:30.815 --> 01:08:34.139
And now, to return to our proper
timeline and erase this mess.

01:08:37.655 --> 01:08:41.559
There he is! He's got my daughter
in that giant space apple!

01:08:48.374 --> 01:08:50.617
My face is numb.

01:08:52.378 --> 01:08:53.920
- Whoo-hoo!
- Yes!

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:56.703
What's wrong?

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:02.622
Time travel failed.

01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:03.876
Oh, dear.

01:09:03.890 --> 01:09:06.183
What is it, Mr. Peabody?

01:09:06.184 --> 01:09:07.309
Our cosmic doubles colliding...

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:09.337
ripped a hole
in the space-time continuum.

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:11.563
That's why we didn't
get to the past.

01:09:14.609 --> 01:09:16.777
Hey, Peabody!

01:09:16.778 --> 01:09:19.146
Looks like the past
is coming to us.

01:09:20.657 --> 01:09:23.230
Oof! I will get you, dog!

01:09:23.284 --> 01:09:25.077
And your little boy, too!

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:28.747
Penny!

01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:30.149
My bride!

01:09:33.586 --> 01:09:34.908
What?

01:09:37.090 --> 01:09:39.959
Oh, dear.

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:49.961
Follow that orb!

01:10:02.907 --> 01:10:04.684
Incoming!

01:10:07.912 --> 01:10:09.955
What sort of creature are you?

01:10:09.956 --> 01:10:13.200
The name is Grunion!

01:10:15.253 --> 01:10:17.121
I'm in love!

01:10:19.757 --> 01:10:22.080
I just need to find a wormhole.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.976
Hey, Einstein, it's a red light.

01:10:30.977 --> 01:10:33.254
Hey, I'm walking, here!

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:35.564
Cake!

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:37.512
Mmm!

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.976
There they go. Don't lose them.

01:10:48.161 --> 01:10:50.370
I'm trying to find
another wormhole...

01:10:50.371 --> 01:10:51.413
but they all lead
back to the present!

01:10:51.414 --> 01:10:53.066
Time travel failed.

01:10:53.708 --> 01:10:55.234
Time travel failed.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:01.882
Whoo!

01:11:01.883 --> 01:11:04.134
There he is. After them!

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:07.209
Penny, my queen,
I know you're in there.

01:11:07.805 --> 01:11:10.253
We're coming, Shermanus!

01:11:13.895 --> 01:11:15.020
Time travel failed.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:16.062
Mr. Peabody!

01:11:16.063 --> 01:11:17.589
Look out!

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.097
Whoa!

01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:28.074
Shermanus, hold on.

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:30.202
We shall release you from this egg.

01:11:33.206 --> 01:11:36.082
Drop the saber and step away
from the futuristic orb.

01:11:36.083 --> 01:11:38.335
I take orders from no man!

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:48.459
Don't tase me, bro.

01:11:48.805 --> 01:11:51.003
Come out, Peabody, with
your paws in the air.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.143
Mr. Peabody, you're under arrest...

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:57.437
for kidnapping, reckless
endangerment...

01:11:57.438 --> 01:12:00.899
And a multiplicity of
major traffic violations.

01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.942
You don't understand.

01:12:01.943 --> 01:12:04.402
There's a rip
in the space-time continuum!

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:06.530
If you arrest me,
I won't be able to fix...

01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:08.698
Blah, blah, blah. For too long...

01:12:08.699 --> 01:12:11.743
you've bamboozled the world
with your fancy jargon...

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:13.078
and that little red tie of yours...

01:12:13.079 --> 01:12:14.579
and look what's come of it.

01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:15.664
Take him away!

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:16.706
Wait.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:18.875
Mr. Peabody!

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:20.277
Sherman!

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:23.964
What's gonna happen to Mr. Peabody?

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:27.092
Don't you know what
happens to dogs that bite?

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:28.760
Let me go.

01:12:28.761 --> 01:12:30.178
You don't know what you're doing.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:32.305
Please, before it's too late.

01:12:32.306 --> 01:12:34.174
Wait!

01:12:34.308 --> 01:12:35.934
Give him another chance.

01:12:35.935 --> 01:12:39.980
He's through with chances. Now,
he has to pay for his mistakes.

01:12:39.981 --> 01:12:41.815
But I'm the one who
made all the mistakes.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:44.734
I'm the one who used the
WABAC without permission.

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:48.014
The only mistake
Mr. Peabody ever made...

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:50.353
was me.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:52.935
Sherman.

01:12:53.077 --> 01:12:55.453
You're absolutely right, Sherman.

01:12:55.454 --> 01:12:59.984
What kind of a father could
this dog ever be to a boy?

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:04.337
Maybe you're right, Ms. Grunion.

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:06.715
But there's one thing
you haven't considered.

01:13:06.716 --> 01:13:08.208
What's that?

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.745
I'm a dog, too!

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:16.141
If being a dog means
you're like Mr. Peabody...

01:13:16.142 --> 01:13:18.101
who never turns his back on you...

01:13:18.102 --> 01:13:21.146
and who's always there to
pick you up when you fall...

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:25.442
and loves you no matter how
many times you mess up...

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.903
if that's what it
means to be a dog...

01:13:27.904 --> 01:13:31.524
then, yeah, I'm a dog, too!

01:13:33.034 --> 01:13:35.311
I'm a dog, too.

01:13:35.661 --> 01:13:38.079
I'm a dog, too.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.041
I'm a dog, too!

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.667
I'm a dog as well!

01:13:42.668 --> 01:13:44.085
A poodle dog!

01:13:44.086 --> 01:13:46.171
I am a dog, too.

01:13:46.172 --> 01:13:47.839
Ditto on that dog thing!

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.746
I'm a dog, too.

01:13:53.012 --> 01:13:54.179
I am a dog as well.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:55.430
I'm a dog, too.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.957
I'm a dog, too.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.927
I'm a dog, too.

01:14:14.659 --> 01:14:17.187
I'm Spartacus!

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:21.331
All right, fine, you're all dogs,
but you can't change the law.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:23.609
I know someone who can.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:27.287
George Washington.

01:14:28.172 --> 01:14:31.633
We hold these truths
to be self-evident...

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:37.597
that all men, and some
dogs, are created equal.

01:14:37.598 --> 01:14:42.519
I hereby award Mr. Peabody
a presidential pardon.

01:14:42.520 --> 01:14:43.770
Me, too.

01:14:43.771 --> 01:14:45.271
I've done worse.

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:55.479
Huh?

01:14:59.453 --> 01:15:01.196
Uh, Mr. Peabody, look!

01:15:06.419 --> 01:15:08.241
Ahh!

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:10.914
Ooh!

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:15.427
It's getting closer!

01:15:15.428 --> 01:15:17.095
What are we going to do?

01:15:17.096 --> 01:15:19.431
This is the greatest collection
of geniuses ever assembled!

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:22.711
Surely we can come up with another
way of getting to the past.

01:15:22.768 --> 01:15:24.269
I can build a catapult.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.895
We go very fast.

01:15:25.896 --> 01:15:29.149
But, remember, as you approach
the speed of light...

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.443
gravity will get too strong.

01:15:31.444 --> 01:15:34.946
Oh, indeed. "For every action, there
is an equal and opposite reaction."

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:38.783
How about we just punch
that big hole in the face?

01:15:47.626 --> 01:15:49.419
I have an idea.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:52.547
Hey, everybody, I have an idea!

01:15:52.548 --> 01:15:54.074
Yes, what is it, Sherman?

01:15:54.884 --> 01:15:57.161
Why not go to the future?

01:15:57.178 --> 01:15:58.428
The future?

01:15:58.429 --> 01:16:03.209
I've never been there before, so
it's probably not as messed up.

01:16:03.893 --> 01:16:05.226
Sherman, that's it!

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:07.145
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

01:16:07.146 --> 01:16:08.521
Not usually.

01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:11.220
It's exactly what
you all just said...

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:13.635
except the total opposite!

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:17.530
If we set the WABAC for the
future, and go very, very fast...

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.908
we'll create our own
gravitational field...

01:16:19.909 --> 01:16:21.868
that's equal and opposite...

01:16:21.869 --> 01:16:25.569
to the rip in
the space-time continuum!

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.249
Oh, my...

01:16:28.250 --> 01:16:29.793
I don't get it.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:33.789
We're gonna fly up there and
punch that big hole in the face!

01:16:33.798 --> 01:16:34.994
Yes!

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:39.874
Sherman, you're a genius.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.180
But, Peabody...

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:45.058
how far into the future must you go?

01:16:45.059 --> 01:16:46.976
Just a few seconds ought to do it,

01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:48.895
and then we'll
slingshot right back.

01:16:48.896 --> 01:16:50.939
Are you sure this is going to work?

01:16:50.940 --> 01:16:52.808
Don't worry, Penny.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:55.060
Just remember, I'm a...

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:57.847
genius!

01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.822
Sherman...

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.824
I need to reprogram the WABAC.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:02.075
All right, Mr. Peabody.

01:17:02.076 --> 01:17:04.524
That means you have to drive.

01:17:33.232 --> 01:17:35.066
In order to make the leap
into the future...

01:17:35.067 --> 01:17:37.026
the WABAC will
have to go very fast.

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:39.225
Faster than it's ever gone before!

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:42.312
Are you ready, Sherman?

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.730
I'm ready.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:50.065
Come on, Sherman, you can do it.

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:02.260
Now, Mr. Peabody?

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:04.413
Sherman, we need more speed.

01:18:07.308 --> 01:18:08.641
Now?

01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:10.518
Just a little more!

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:14.397
Not yet, Sherman.

01:18:14.398 --> 01:18:15.674
Not yet.

01:18:16.483 --> 01:18:17.679
Now!

01:18:52.978 --> 01:18:54.755
Whoa! Whoa!

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:56.481
Farewell!

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:05.823
Ooh!

01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:08.243
You haven't seen the
last of me, Peabody.

01:19:08.244 --> 01:19:11.621
You'll make a mistake
eventually, and when you do...

01:19:11.622 --> 01:19:13.957
I'll be there!

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:15.667
- The Grunion is mine!
- Ooh!

01:19:36.313 --> 01:19:39.842
Come on, Sherman. Come on!

01:20:01.922 --> 01:20:04.450
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

01:20:29.116 --> 01:20:31.075
If you want to watch television
before I get home...

01:20:31.076 --> 01:20:33.244
simply press "input" three times...

01:20:33.245 --> 01:20:34.620
and then use the remote
control as usual.

01:20:34.621 --> 01:20:35.788
Yes, Sherman.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.291
And if you're worried about making
friends at the PTA meeting...

01:20:38.292 --> 01:20:40.043
consider bringing
snacks for everyone.

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:41.878
Bagels are always appreciated.

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:43.622
Yes, Sherman.

01:20:44.423 --> 01:20:46.090
And remember, Mr. Peabody...

01:20:46.091 --> 01:20:49.415
I have robotics club
after school today.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.721
Sherman, wait.

01:20:51.722 --> 01:20:53.874
Yes, Mr. Peabody?

01:20:55.100 --> 01:20:56.922
I...

01:20:57.895 --> 01:21:00.548
I love you, Sherman.

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:07.517
I have a deep regard for
you as well, Mr. Peabody.

01:21:18.665 --> 01:21:20.041
Hey, Mr. Peabody!

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:21.292
Hey, Sherman!

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:22.910
Wait up!

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:27.006
No doubt about it.

01:21:27.007 --> 01:21:29.910
Every dog should have a boy.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:52.941
Oh!

01:21:55.494 --> 01:21:57.912
Ooh!

01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.065
Ah!

01:22:02.084 --> 01:22:03.952
A-ha!

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:21.060
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:22:21.061 --> 01:22:23.680
You may kiss the Grunion.

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:27.225
Come here, soldier.

01:22:41.540 --> 01:22:44.739
There's always time for living

01:22:45.210 --> 01:22:48.113
Can we just do it again?

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:55.129
One more time like it
once was way back when

01:22:56.305 --> 01:22:59.379
You gave me something to believe in

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:03.003
We were the best of friends

01:23:03.896 --> 01:23:09.928
Well, I remember the
good times way back when

01:23:16.366 --> 01:23:21.397
Memories will fade if you
wanted me to let you go

01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:28.085
I've got you on your way I feel
it for you, don't you know

01:23:28.086 --> 01:23:31.114
We're superheroes and villains

01:23:31.673 --> 01:23:34.417
When we used to pretend

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:41.591
We'd go wherever our minds
would take us way back when

01:23:45.979 --> 01:23:50.509
Memories will fade if you
wanted me to let you go

01:23:53.278 --> 01:23:57.854
I've got you on your way I feel
it for you, don't you know

01:24:00.410 --> 01:24:05.281
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

01:24:08.126 --> 01:24:12.872
I know we'll be okay This
luck we have, it cannot go

01:24:13.465 --> 01:24:15.993
'Cause you're on your own

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:19.879
You're not alone

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:26.838
I know I'll see you again Again

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:31.133
And if all these things

01:24:31.525 --> 01:24:34.849
Come to an end

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:40.396
We'll always have a way back when

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:51.490
Memories will fade if you
wanted me to let you go

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:59.085
I've got you on your way I feel
it for you, don't you know

01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:05.960
It's a promise that I made
Never be afraid

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:14.309
I know we'll be okay, this
luck we have, it cannot go
