getting her period in the desert.

to still do those book clubs, buddy.

you don't wanna do.

-Not me. Not anymore.
-What... What do you mean?

Haley and I are splitting.

00:10:41.099 --> 00:10:43.225
What?

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:46.020
-But you guys are happy.
-No, Phil, we're not.

why are we here, then, in your house,

00:10:55.697 --> 00:10:58.657
-having book club?
-I haven't told the kids.

00:10:59.576 --> 00:11:01.368
Can't tell the kids.

So, what happened? I mean...

00:11:10.962 --> 00:11:13.172
I thought everything was fine. Really.

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:15.966
The next thing I know,
Haley starts getting more and more distant,

00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.677
and eventually she tells me,
and I'm quoting here,

00:11:18.762 --> 00:11:22.431
"I'm... I'm strangling
in the noose of sameness."

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:24.892
So, at first, I was pissed. I really was.

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:27.019

I know what she's talking about, okay.

in these roles together,

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:30.314

No matter how hard he tries,
he can't play a doctor.

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.579
Oh, yeah. No. It'd be like,

00:11:45.663 --> 00:11:47.581
"Why is Long Duk Dong
dressed up like a doctor?"

00:11:47.665 --> 00:11:50.209

you and Phil actually danced together?

00:19:42.723 --> 00:19:45.725
Okay, well, I'm gonna have to ask you
to wait at the bar,

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:48.895
and if anything opens up,
we'll come get you, okay?

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.314
-Thank you.
-Mank you!

00:19:51.399 --> 00:19:52.858
Okay. We'll be standing over there.

00:19:52.942 --> 00:19:54.317
Okay. I've already forgotten about you.

00:19:54.402 --> 00:19:55.694
-All right.
-(PHONE RINGING)

00:19:55.778 --> 00:19:57.529
This is Claw, you're welcome.

00:19:57.613 --> 00:20:00.824
PHIL: You know what?
I have a feeling we're gonna get a table.

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:03.660
I think tonight we're going to get lucky.

00:20:04.078 --> 00:20:05.912
Wow. Must be nice.

00:20:05.997 --> 00:20:08.123
I didn't... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

00:20:08.207 --> 00:20:09.583
Thank you. You're very kind.

00:20:09.667 --> 00:20:11.084
-You want a drink?
-Yes, please.

00:20:11.168 --> 00:20:13.920
Something with an edible garnish.
I'm so hungry.

00:20:14.005 --> 00:20:18.425
Hello? Hi! Two chardonnays, please.
Could I have some...

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:22.387
-Sort of distracted.
-Maybe we should go someplace else.

00:20:22.471 --> 00:20:26.057
-No, no. Just give it some time.
-Tripplehorn, party of two?

00:20:28.227 --> 00:20:31.438
I just... I want tonight to be different,
you know?

00:20:31.522 --> 00:20:34.608
I know. And so do I.
But it's just not in the cards, right?

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.611
-Tripplehorn, party of two?
-So let's just head back.

00:20:37.695 --> 00:20:39.112
No, no. We're good.

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:44.743
-Look around. This place isn't us.
-Tripplehorn, party of two? Tripplehorn?

00:20:44.827 --> 00:20:48.163
What do you say? Teaneck Tavern?
Cozy booth for two?

00:20:48.247 --> 00:20:51.166
-It's fine. Really.
-No.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:52.709
No, it's not.

00:20:54.629 --> 00:20:56.713
Tripplehorn, party of two?

00:20:58.507 --> 00:21:00.717
Us. Us!

00:21:02.803 --> 00:21:04.971
We are the Tripplehorns.

00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:07.265
Great. This way.

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:13.688
-What are you doing, Phil?
-Trust me. It's fine.

00:21:13.773 --> 00:21:15.941
Honey, I don't think
we should be doing this.

00:21:16.025 --> 00:21:17.609
And here we are.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:22.072
-May I take your coat?
-Yes. Thank you.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.659
-Enjoy your meal.
-Thank you.

00:21:26.494 --> 00:21:28.286
-Look at this table.
-Honey, I...

00:21:28.371 --> 00:21:30.080
No, no! Hon, no. Look.

00:21:30.164 --> 00:21:32.290
The Tripplehorns are a no-show.
Who are we hurting?

00:21:32.375 --> 00:21:34.292
I say we sit back, relax,

00:21:34.377 --> 00:21:37.462
and enjoy a spread
of their finest fruits of the sea.

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:41.383
Or I will just suck on a napkin.
Holy mama, look at these prices.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:44.886
If we're gonna pay this much for crab,
it better sing and dance

00:21:44.971 --> 00:21:47.639
and introduce us to the Little Mermaid.

00:21:48.766 --> 00:21:51.893
Hey. Here's to a great night.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.023
Oh, no, wait, isn't it bad luck
to toast with an empty glass?

00:21:57.108 --> 00:21:58.900
I don't think that's a thing.

00:22:02.488 --> 00:22:07.033
CLAIRE: Mmm. I would trade Charlotte
for a lifetime supply of risotto.

00:22:07.118 --> 00:22:08.910
PHIL: (LAUGHING)
What does that even mean?

00:22:08.995 --> 00:22:10.245
CLAIRE: I just thought it'd be cool.

00:22:10.329 --> 00:22:13.665
-Not Ollie, but Charlotte, yes.
-I understand. No, I understand.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:15.917
Mmm.

00:22:19.797 --> 00:22:22.090
Oh. Hey, what's the story?

00:22:23.092 --> 00:22:26.886
Yes. Okay. He is a successful financier,

00:22:26.971 --> 00:22:31.349
and she is getting drunk enough
to get through what's gonna happen later.

00:22:31.434 --> 00:22:35.186
'Cause he likes to do weird stuff.
He's gonna call her by his mom's name.

00:22:35.271 --> 00:22:36.563
(LAUGHING)

00:22:41.569 --> 00:22:44.279
Okay, yeah. Back here. What's the story?

00:22:44.697 --> 00:22:49.909
He is a record producer.
And she is an act that he wants to sign.

00:22:53.497 --> 00:22:55.331
Oh, no, that's Will.i.am.

00:22:55.416 --> 00:22:56.916
Better yet. That's Will.i.am,

00:22:57.001 --> 00:22:58.460
-and she is a backup singer.
-No.

00:22:58.544 --> 00:23:02.756
No, but that's actually Will.i.am.
That's Will.i.am. From Fergie.

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:04.424
Oh, my God!

00:23:05.634 --> 00:23:08.928
If I knew anything about Will.i.am,
I'd be really psyched right now.

00:23:09.013 --> 00:23:11.014
Oh! You know what? Okay.
Give me your phone.

00:23:11.098 --> 00:23:13.475
-What? Why?
-I'm taking a picture.

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:14.893
-What?
-I'm... Give me your phone.

00:23:14.977 --> 00:23:15.977
-You're walking over there.
-No.

00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:17.353
-I'm gonna be that guy.
-No.

00:23:17.438 --> 00:23:18.855
-Yeah. Go ahead. Go over.
-This is dumb.

00:23:18.939 --> 00:23:20.315
-And you're gonna make a fool of yourself.
-Okay.

00:23:20.399 --> 00:23:21.608
Do it. Do it.

00:23:22.026 --> 00:23:24.569
This is gonna embarrass you so much.

00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.285
(MOUTHING) Did you get it?

00:23:32.369 --> 00:23:34.037
(WHISPERING) Did you get it?
Did you get it?

00:23:34.497 --> 00:23:38.124
-(LAUGHING) Oh, no! Oh, wow!
-Did you get it? What?

00:23:39.710 --> 00:23:40.919
-You...
-Good.

00:23:41.003 --> 00:23:42.170
(GIGGLING GIRLISHLY)

00:23:43.672 --> 00:23:47.675
You are a freak.
I can't believe you'd actually do it.

00:23:47.843 --> 00:23:49.636
Excuse me, Mr. and Mrs. Tripplehorn?

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:52.680
-Oh. Yes?
-Oh, well.

00:23:52.765 --> 00:23:55.809
Hello. Yes, we are the Tripplehorn. Horns.

00:23:55.893 --> 00:23:58.603
-Oh, boy.
-Who, might I ask, are you,

00:23:58.687 --> 00:24:00.522
to be asking us who we are?

00:24:01.398 --> 00:24:04.484
We just wanted to have
a few words with you, if that's okay.

00:24:04.985 --> 00:24:08.363
-And what is this about?
-I think you know.

00:24:08.572 --> 00:24:10.615
Why don't we save everyone
a lot of embarrassment,

00:24:10.699 --> 00:24:12.867
have this conversation in private?

00:24:12.952 --> 00:24:15.245
Okay. But can I have
the rest of my risotto wrapped?

00:24:15.329 --> 00:24:19.082
Because these truffles are amazing
and super expensive.

00:24:19.959 --> 00:24:22.210
Get up. Now.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.045
Honey?

00:24:24.255 --> 00:24:26.464
Get up. Now.

00:24:26.549 --> 00:24:27.924
(BOTH LAUGHING)

00:24:28.259 --> 00:24:31.177
Okay. All right. (CLEARS THROAT)

00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:35.265
-Okay.
-Okay.

00:24:35.349 --> 00:24:36.850
-Yeah, I think you need to move. Now.
-Just...

00:24:36.934 --> 00:24:38.143
-Okay.
-We'll follow you.

00:24:38.227 --> 00:24:39.644
-That's an expensive bottle.
-Yeah, I know.

00:24:39.728 --> 00:24:41.563
-I'll get your glasses.
-Hello.

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.900
We are leaving by choice.
Leaving by choice right now.

00:24:47.987 --> 00:24:49.404
PHIL: Watch your step.

00:24:50.531 --> 00:24:51.573
(CLAIRE SIGHING)

00:24:51.657 --> 00:24:53.199
CLAIRE: Come on, guys,
what's the big deal?

00:24:53.284 --> 00:24:54.492
We didn't hurt anyone, right?

00:24:54.577 --> 00:24:58.580
If I were you, I wouldn't say another word,
you thieving bitch.

00:24:58.747 --> 00:25:00.331
-Excuse me, I don't like that.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:25:00.416 --> 00:25:02.333
Let's just dial it down a little bit, guys...

00:25:02.418 --> 00:25:04.002
-Hey! What are you doing?
-CLAIRE: Hey!

00:25:04.086 --> 00:25:05.628
-Get away! Get off! What are you doing?
-Hey!

00:25:05.754 --> 00:25:07.422
-Get... Hey, my wallet!
-CLAIRE: Oh, my God.

00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:10.008
-I'm starting to get... Stop it!
-Give me my phone! Get away from me!

00:25:10.092 --> 00:25:11.843
Okay, I am getting seriously pissed off.

00:25:11.927 --> 00:25:15.305
This is going way beyond
a negative review in Zagat.

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:17.599
(EXCLAIMS)

00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:20.810
Now I'm gonna have to pick that risotto
up off the ground to eat it.

00:25:20.895 --> 00:25:22.979
I wanna talk to your boss right now!

00:25:23.063 --> 00:25:26.232
I think we both know
that's not gonna happen, Mr. Tripplehorn,

00:25:26.317 --> 00:25:27.942
or should I say,

00:25:28.694 --> 00:25:30.195
Phil Foster.

00:25:30.279 --> 00:25:31.738
Next time you make a dinner reservation,

00:25:31.822 --> 00:25:34.699
don't use the same alias
as your ransom notes, you dick.

00:25:34.783 --> 00:25:36.117
Ransom note?

00:25:36.202 --> 00:25:39.037
CLAIRE: Listen, we are just a regular,
boring couple from New Jersey.

00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:42.957
-Let's just get this done.
-Get what done? What do you want?

00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:44.375
You know what we want.

00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.127
-We don't actually. We really don't.
-No, we don't.

00:25:46.212 --> 00:25:48.546
You know what we want.

00:25:50.466 --> 00:25:51.966
We want the flash drive!

00:25:52.051 --> 00:25:55.136
All right, all right, all right! Okay, I'm sorry.

00:25:55.221 --> 00:25:59.349
Did you really think you could steal
from Joe Miletto and get away with it?

00:26:00.517 --> 00:26:02.644
Okay, someone somewhere
is making a huge mistake.

00:26:02.728 --> 00:26:04.896
-Yeah, guys. Seriously, this is...
-This is a mistake.

00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.232
This is just a big, big,
goofy misunderstanding.

00:26:07.316 --> 00:26:09.609
-Yeah.
-We are Phil and Claire Foster.

00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:12.111
We don't know anything
about a ransom note.

00:26:12.196 --> 00:26:14.405
-We don't have a flash drive, I assure you.
-No.

00:26:14.490 --> 00:26:15.573
You were sitting at the table.

00:26:15.658 --> 00:26:17.784
The girl at the front said
you were the Tripplehorns.

00:26:17.868 --> 00:26:20.411
-No, no, no, no.
-Okay, let me... Okay. Let me explain.

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:23.414
My husband, very sweetly, but delusionally,

00:26:23.499 --> 00:26:26.167
thought that we could
make it here early enough to get a table.

00:26:26.252 --> 00:26:27.752
And we didn't. We were late,

00:26:27.836 --> 00:26:30.838
because he won't listen
to the lady in the car,

00:26:30.923 --> 00:26:33.800
-so they were very rude to us.
-They were so rude! That one guy...

00:26:33.884 --> 00:26:36.386
And when we heard them
calling the reservation for Tripplehorns,

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.263
-he was, like, "Us! Us!"
-"Us! Us!" That's...

00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:40.223
CLAIRE: And so we took it.
PHIL: Just going for it.

00:26:40.307 --> 00:26:41.474
And then we had a great time.

00:26:41.558 --> 00:26:42.767
I'm not gonna lie to you.
We had a great time.

00:26:42.851 --> 00:26:45.478
-So much fun.
-The food, unbelievable.

00:26:45.562 --> 00:26:46.938
-So good.
-So good.

00:26:47.022 --> 00:26:49.107
-But then you came over...
-We had this rice thing...

00:26:49.191 --> 00:26:51.693
Look, shut up! I don't wanna hear that.

00:26:52.528 --> 00:26:55.196
So you just took
somebody else's reservation?

00:26:55.281 --> 00:26:56.614
-For the record, I was against it.
-I...

00:26:56.699 --> 00:26:58.408
But my husband gets
these plans in his head,

00:26:58.492 --> 00:27:01.202
-and it becomes, like, a thing.
-I'm an idiot sometimes.

00:27:01.287 --> 00:27:02.912
Shut up. Shut up.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.583
-I believe you're the Fosters.
-Thank you.

00:27:07.668 --> 00:27:10.086
I also believe
you go by the alias "Tripplehorn"

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.796
-and that you stole my boss's property.
-No. No.

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:14.173
And now you're just
too scared shitless to admit it.

00:27:14.258 --> 00:27:17.385
So I will give you three seconds
to give us back the flash drive!

00:27:17.469 --> 00:27:19.137
What... Okay. The three seconds game?

00:27:19.221 --> 00:27:21.389
Sorry, sir. But, you know,
I play this every day with my kids.

00:27:21.473 --> 00:27:23.516
-She invented that thing.
-That's not scary.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.560
I will blow a hole in your face.

00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:27.145
-This is a different version.
-One...

00:27:27.229 --> 00:27:29.063
Okay, big mistake. This is all just a big...

00:27:29.148 --> 00:27:30.982
...two...

00:27:31.066 --> 00:27:34.068
Hey! God! No!
He turned it sideways. Kill shot!

00:27:34.153 --> 00:27:36.321
-Kitchen! Kitchen people!
-That's a kill shot! God!

00:27:36.405 --> 00:27:37.697
-...three!
-PHIL: No, no, no, no, no!

00:27:37.781 --> 00:27:40.116
All right! All right! All right!
I've got it! I've got it! I've got it!

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.452
-He's gonna kill us both! What?
-I've got the flash drive.

00:27:42.911 --> 00:27:45.079
-Thought so.
-Where is it?

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:49.542
It's in the park.

00:27:49.626 --> 00:27:53.087
-The park?
-Could you be more specific?

00:27:54.882 --> 00:27:56.758
The Central Park.

00:27:58.427 --> 00:28:00.678
Okay, this is what's gonna happen.

00:28:00.763 --> 00:28:04.474
We're all gonna take
a little field trip to the Central Park,

00:28:04.558 --> 00:28:07.852
and you're gonna show us
exactly where it is. Okay?

00:28:10.022 --> 00:28:11.105
Okay.

CLAIRE: Oh, God. Oh, my God, Phil.

00:28:17.988 --> 00:28:20.615
We're going to a second location.

00:28:22.409 --> 00:28:26.496
Oh, we're getting in a car.
That's always bad.

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.509
(DOOR LOCK CLICKING)

00:28:41.804 --> 00:28:44.389
Yeah, 'cause we left the door unlocked.

00:28:58.821 --> 00:29:00.321
They're locked.

00:29:01.573 --> 00:29:03.533
You locked that one, too.

00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:05.660
Good call. I would've done that.

00:29:29.017 --> 00:29:31.519
(WHISPERING) Why did you bring us
to the most deserted place in New York?

00:29:31.603 --> 00:29:33.271
I don't know, Claire. The gun was sideways.

00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:34.689
We gotta get someplace populated.

00:29:34.773 --> 00:29:37.108
Well, maybe there'll be people there.
Some closeted gay men, or...

00:29:37.192 --> 00:29:39.902
-No, no. No. Night boating.
-Night boating?

00:29:39.987 --> 00:29:42.280
Night boating. It's very popular here.
I read an article about it.

00:29:42.364 --> 00:29:43.948
We'll be fine.

00:29:45.701 --> 00:29:47.577
We need to go to the boathouse.

00:29:47.661 --> 00:29:48.953
Get out.

00:30:05.846 --> 00:30:07.638
CLAIRE: There's nobody here.

00:30:07.723 --> 00:30:10.558
(WHISPERING) Okay. You know,

00:30:12.186 --> 00:30:15.396
the night boating thing
might have been in Seattle.

00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.150
I think I may have led us off track
a little bit here.

00:30:19.735 --> 00:30:21.402

00:30:23.655 --> 00:30:27.825

CLAIRE: (WHISPERING) We have to get
near people immediately.

00:30:41.006 --> 00:30:42.924
You tell them that you have a condition
and we need medicine,

00:30:43.008 --> 00:30:44.217
and you've left the medicine in the car

00:30:44.301 --> 00:30:46.135
and it's medicine
that can only be administered by a doctor.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.429
-Good, good, good. Why?
-It's for your penis.

00:30:48.514 --> 00:30:51.390
It's intravenous penis medicine,
and you're very shy, so we have to get

00:30:51.475 --> 00:30:53.267
-to the nearest hospital.
-What's wrong with my penis?

Phil has kind of a serious medical issue...

00:31:19.503 --> 00:31:22.046
-Claire, just give him the flash drive.
-What? We have to...

00:31:22.130 --> 00:31:23.839
Claire, just show them
where the flash drive is.

00:31:23.924 --> 00:31:25.049
It's not gonna work.

-Claire...

Have to give them the flash drive, Claire.

00:31:28.637 --> 00:31:30.137
But your penis!

00:31:31.765 --> 00:31:33.057
It is a two-step procedure...

00:31:33.141 --> 00:31:34.892
-Claire...
-...that needs to be done by a nurse...

00:31:34.977 --> 00:31:36.394
-PHIL: Just... It's not...
-...a registered nurse,

00:31:36.478 --> 00:31:38.104

-My penis is fine.

Yeah, be a good girl. Listen to me.

00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:25.529
-That is gonna be a problem for me.
-What?

00:39:25.613 --> 00:39:27.364
I actually have a party to get to.

00:39:27.449 --> 00:39:30.743
No. Why would you be going to a party?
You're babysitting.

00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:34.246
Yeah, I mean, you guys are the Fosters.
You're always home by 9:30.

00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:36.582
Yeah, well, tonight, it just so happens

00:39:36.666 --> 00:39:38.917
that we're gonna be staying out
a little bit later.

00:39:39.002 --> 00:39:41.378
Nice. But I already promised my friends.

00:39:41.463 --> 00:39:43.714
-Could you talk to her?
-Okay. Okay.

00:39:43.798 --> 00:39:45.799
-Katy? Hi, it's Phil.
-Hi.

00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:47.384
Where's that frigging guy
when you need him?

00:39:47.469 --> 00:39:49.970
Katy, I don't have time to talk right now.
I'll pay you double to stay.

00:39:50.055 --> 00:39:52.389
That's really nice of you,
but I don't think that's gonna close it.

00:39:52.474 --> 00:39:53.557
Are you kidding me?

00:39:53.641 --> 00:39:55.225
-What? What is she saying?
-She's saying...

00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.811
What is that little bitch saying?
Herjeans are too tight!

00:39:57.896 --> 00:40:01.482
You see, the thing is, my dad's been saying
I should jack your rate for a while now.

00:40:01.691 --> 00:40:03.734
So, I could miss the party,

00:40:03.818 --> 00:40:06.779
but, I think, rate-wise,
we're talking somewhere north of 30.

00:40:06.863 --> 00:40:08.238
I see them.

00:40:08.323 --> 00:40:10.574
-Pay it!
-Okay, fine. Fine. Katy, that's fine.

00:40:10.658 --> 00:40:12.618
Just get the kids out of the house
right now.

00:40:12.702 --> 00:40:14.453
Don't go out the front door.
Go out the back door.

00:40:14.537 --> 00:40:15.662
Take them over to your house.

00:40:15.747 --> 00:40:17.498
Okay, now I'm sensing
some kind of element of danger here.

00:40:17.582 --> 00:40:18.624
No. No.

00:40:18.708 --> 00:40:20.334
'Cause that's gonna run you
an extra five per.

00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:22.252
Fine! Fine! Just get the kids out right now!

00:40:22.337 --> 00:40:24.463
Tell them we love them
and everything is gonna be okay!

00:40:24.547 --> 00:40:26.048
Everything's okay! Tell them we love them.

00:40:26.132 --> 00:40:27.424
-Bye.
-Okay.

00:40:27.509 --> 00:40:29.176
Sucker. Kids!

00:40:29.469 --> 00:40:30.677
-Now what?
-They're safe. They're safe.

00:40:30.762 --> 00:40:33.472
We need to find someplace
with a lot of people. A lot of people.

00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:44.274
Hi, hi. Excuse me.

00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:46.443
Don't worry, we're not going to hurt you.

00:40:46.528 --> 00:40:49.279
Our names are Claire and Phil Foster.

00:40:49.364 --> 00:40:53.408
We are from New Jersey,
and through a series of strange events,

00:40:53.493 --> 00:40:55.536
we have been confused with someone else.

00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:58.789
And now, some unruly criminals,
who are also policemen...

00:40:58.873 --> 00:41:00.541
-Right.
-...are hunting us as prey.

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:04.086
Again, we're not the bad guys, they are.
We're not going to hurt you.

00:41:04.170 --> 00:41:05.546
Honey, stop saying that,
'cause it makes it sound

00:41:05.630 --> 00:41:07.589
-like we are gonna hurt them.
-No, no. They get it.

00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:10.926
We need a place to hole up and hide,
and we don't have any money

00:41:11.010 --> 00:41:13.428
because these criminals, these dirty cops...

00:41:13.513 --> 00:41:15.848
Hey, hey.
Do I look like I was born yesterday?

00:41:15.932 --> 00:41:17.891
Okay, this is the oldest scam in the book.

00:41:17.976 --> 00:41:19.143
Beat it, junkies.

00:41:19.227 --> 00:41:20.769
-MAN: They make me sick.
-So dirty.

00:41:21.396 --> 00:41:22.563
Let's go.

00:41:22.856 --> 00:41:24.523
We are on our own.

00:41:26.901 --> 00:41:29.194
This whole night was a mistake.

00:41:29.279 --> 00:41:31.822
We never should've come in to this city.
This was a crazy idea.

00:41:31.906 --> 00:41:34.992
It wasn't a crazy idea.
It was just dinner in Manhattan.

00:41:35.076 --> 00:41:37.828
One night, one date where we're just not
talking about the kids the entire time

00:41:37.912 --> 00:41:40.414
-or what we have to do next week.
-And look where it got us.

00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:42.040
We should call 91 1 .

00:41:42.125 --> 00:41:44.042
Honey, this is Joe Miletto
we're talking about.

00:41:44.127 --> 00:41:46.461
-So?
-So? Those cops that tried to kill us?

00:41:46.546 --> 00:41:47.963
They're in his pocket.

00:41:48.047 --> 00:41:50.883
This guy owns cops!
We can't trust any cops.

00:41:50.967 --> 00:41:53.802
What are we gonna do? We can't go home,
we can't go to the police...

00:41:53.928 --> 00:41:58.515
Okay, okay, okay.
Miletto, he wants the Tripplehorns, why?

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.100
Because they have the flash drive.

00:42:00.185 --> 00:42:03.437
All right,
what if they gave him the flash drive back?

00:42:03.521 --> 00:42:04.897
Why would they do that?

00:42:04.981 --> 00:42:07.524
Because we're gonna find them,
and we're gonna make them do it.

00:42:07.609 --> 00:42:09.943
Once Miletto has the flash drive,
this thing ends.

00:42:10.028 --> 00:42:11.695
Okay. I like that. I am completely with you.

00:42:11.779 --> 00:42:14.948
I just have to ask you one question,
and do not judge me.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.950
What is a flash drive?

00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:19.244
-Seriously?
-Phil, I can't...

00:42:19.329 --> 00:42:22.831
Okay, it's a little storage disk
that you stick in the side of a laptop.

00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:25.042
Oh, it's a computer sticky thing? That's...

00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:27.377
In my office we call it
a computer sticky thing.

00:42:27.462 --> 00:42:30.422
Okay. Okay. We need to get
the computer sticky thing to save our lives.

00:42:30.715 --> 00:42:33.634
How? We don't know anything
about the Tripplehorns.

00:42:33.927 --> 00:42:35.427
That's not entirely true.

00:42:35.511 --> 00:42:37.471
We know where
they were going to have dinner tonight.

00:42:38.973 --> 00:42:40.474
-Okay.
-Come on. Come on.

00:42:46.898 --> 00:42:48.690
Hi, we were... Hello? Up here.

00:42:48.775 --> 00:42:51.902
We were in here earlier,
having dinner with our friend Sam-I-Am.

00:42:51.986 --> 00:42:54.238
-You mean Will.i.am?
-Okay.

00:42:54.322 --> 00:42:56.114
Is that what you call him?
That's weird. I don't like that.

00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:57.824
-Yeah, it is weird.
-No, listen, anyway,

00:42:57.909 --> 00:43:00.744
we were here, and Will.i.am thinks
he left his phone at the table,

00:43:00.828 --> 00:43:02.162
so we need to check at the table.

00:43:02.247 --> 00:43:04.373
I'd like to check the table for the phone,
if you don't mind.

00:43:04.457 --> 00:43:06.833
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Look at me. Can you... Oh, God.

00:43:06.918 --> 00:43:08.919
-We need to check the table for the phone.
-What's your problem?

00:43:09.003 --> 00:43:10.921
-Hello? Hello? Anything?
-Oh, my God.

-Here we go.
-How are you not getting this?

00:43:12.173 --> 00:43:14.424
-He needs to check the table for the phone.
-Fine. This way.

How do we use it to find their address?

00:43:57.885 --> 00:44:00.387
I think I know someone who can help.

00:44:01.514 --> 00:44:03.015
Wait, how do you know this guy, again?

00:44:03.099 --> 00:44:05.976
I showed him a bunch of houses upstate.
I mean, it was a few years ago,

00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:08.895
but I remember
he was some kind of security expert.

00:44:09.397 --> 00:44:11.148
Anyway, he ended up
buying a place down here

00:44:11.232 --> 00:44:12.899
from an agent in this office.

00:44:12.984 --> 00:44:15.110
I forgot the address,
but maybe we can find it in the files.

-No, I don't. Can I have your coat?

-Yeah. You cold?
-Yeah.

Man, you guys are lucky to be alive.

00:48:49.218 --> 00:48:51.386
You're right, Claire.
I would stay away from the cops.

00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:53.430
Which is why we were hoping
that you would help us.

00:48:53.514 --> 00:48:56.057
Well, it's the least I can do.
I mean, you were so patient with me.

00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:58.393
All those long drives
up and down the turnpike.

00:48:58.519 --> 00:49:01.605
Anyway, you were awesome.
Claire, don't leave me hanging.

00:49:01.689 --> 00:49:03.607
That's what I'm talking about.

00:49:03.691 --> 00:49:05.984
I mean, I really did appreciate
all the time you gave me.

00:49:06.068 --> 00:49:09.613
Yeah, sounds like
you guys had a lot of time together, alone,

00:49:09.697 --> 00:49:12.490
together, without me even knowing
about it.

00:49:12.575 --> 00:49:15.535
Tons. I mean,
she went way above and beyond the call.

00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.703
It was my pleasure.

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.872
And this is definitely
the right place for you.

00:49:18.956 --> 00:49:21.207
I bet the ladies love it, too, right?

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:22.792
I... I do all right.

00:49:23.169 --> 00:49:25.962
(SIGHING) I bet you do all kinds of right.

00:49:29.592 --> 00:49:32.260
Tell you what we should do.
We don't have a lot of time,

00:49:32.345 --> 00:49:36.598
so why don't you shirt it up,
and then we will get what we need,

00:49:36.682 --> 00:49:38.391
and then we'll be out of your hair.

00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:41.144
Basically, we have a phone number
that we need to get an address from,

00:49:41.228 --> 00:49:44.814
and I remember that you used to run
your own detective agency or something?

00:49:44.899 --> 00:49:47.233
Yeah, well, sort of.
I mean, I do private security,

00:49:47.318 --> 00:49:49.194
industrial intel,
dealing with rogue governments,

00:49:49.278 --> 00:49:51.363
black ops, that sort of thing. It's a grind.

00:49:51.530 --> 00:49:52.864
PHIL: Uh...

00:49:52.948 --> 00:49:54.824
There is your shirt.

00:49:55.117 --> 00:49:57.077
No wonder you couldn't find it. It's on her.

00:49:57.828 --> 00:50:00.497
Phil, Claire, this is Natanya. She's Israeli.

00:50:00.581 --> 00:50:03.083
-She doesn't speak much English.
-Hello.

00:50:03.167 --> 00:50:05.835
You two make sex with us?

00:50:06.087 --> 00:50:09.673
No, thank you.

00:50:09.757 --> 00:50:11.091
(LAUGHING) No. No.

00:50:15.137 --> 00:50:17.931
(IN HEBREW) Go back to bed, hotness.
I'll be there soon.

00:50:18.099 --> 00:50:19.599
(LAUGHING) Okay.

00:50:19.767 --> 00:50:21.059
(CONTINUES LAUGHING)

00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:26.147
(IN HEBREW) I'm glad that we are not
going to have sex with them.

00:50:26.232 --> 00:50:29.859
They look old and weak.

00:50:35.658 --> 00:50:37.325
-CLAIRE: Bye.
-See you.

00:50:37.451 --> 00:50:39.911
I met her in Tel Aviv
doing some consulting for the Mossad.

00:50:39.995 --> 00:50:42.831
-She is a sweet girl.
-She seems really sweet.

00:50:43.124 --> 00:50:45.875
That was very nice of her
to ask us to have sex.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:48.712
So! You wanna give me that number?

00:50:52.633 --> 00:50:55.510
Looks like we haven't seen
the last of Mr. and Mrs. Foster.

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.221
Somebody tripped an alarm
at a realty office.

00:50:58.305 --> 00:51:00.181
Security cam got these.

00:51:01.767 --> 00:51:03.268
The computer file they're looking at

00:51:03.352 --> 00:51:06.771
shows an address of one Holbrooke Grant.
West Village.

00:51:06.856 --> 00:51:08.648
What in the world are they doing?

00:51:08.733 --> 00:51:10.191
What have we got?

00:51:11.902 --> 00:51:13.445
Minor B and E.

00:51:14.071 --> 00:51:16.573
When was the last time one of those
interested you hot shots?

00:51:16.657 --> 00:51:19.284
Wow. Just trying to be friendly, Arroyo.

00:51:19.785 --> 00:51:21.578
Well, thank you, Officer Friendly.

00:51:22.788 --> 00:51:24.164
Quitting time?

00:51:25.082 --> 00:51:27.083
Yes, sir. See you guys tomorrow.

00:51:27.585 --> 00:51:29.043
Good night.

00:51:29.462 --> 00:51:31.921

-All right, man.

00:51:34.008 --> 00:51:35.133
We checking this out?

00:51:35.217 --> 00:51:38.553
Yeah, definitely.
Let's start at the realty office,

00:51:38.637 --> 00:51:40.180
see what else
they might have been looking at,

00:51:40.806 --> 00:51:43.016
-go from there.
-Okay.

00:51:45.311 --> 00:51:46.728
ARMSTRONG: We got them.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.610
Wow! Where'd you get all this stuff?

00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:55.820
-RadioShack.
-Seriously?

00:51:55.905 --> 00:51:59.699
(LAUGHING) No, Phil, not seriously.
What's wrong with him?

00:51:59.784 --> 00:52:00.950
(LAUGHING)

00:52:01.035 --> 00:52:02.952
Oh, okay.

00:52:03.704 --> 00:52:05.371
Let me see that number.

00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:07.874
Soft hands.

00:52:08.876 --> 00:52:10.960
Type in the number here, and vo ilà.

00:52:11.045 --> 00:52:12.879
It's a cell phone registered
to Thomas Felton.

00:52:12.963 --> 00:52:14.798
Tripplehorn is probably an alias.

00:52:14.882 --> 00:52:17.008
Or, maybe he's
a big Jeanne Tripplehorn fan.

00:52:17.092 --> 00:52:19.636
Shush. Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm.

00:52:19.929 --> 00:52:21.679
There's no address.

00:52:21.764 --> 00:52:24.474
Well, it's a cell phone, Claire.
We don't need a listed address.

00:52:24.767 --> 00:52:26.226
Use the number to locate the signal.

00:52:26.310 --> 00:52:31.898
(LAUGHS) That is too cool.
You are good with your instruments.

00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:34.734
(BEEPING)

00:52:45.579 --> 00:52:49.874
There we go. Mr. Felton's phone
is currently residing at 1 35 Avenue D.

00:52:50.084 --> 00:52:52.085
Great. Who likes shirts?

00:52:55.339 --> 00:52:58.424
-CLAIRE: Thanks again, really.
-Hey, no. It's the least I can do.

00:53:01.345 --> 00:53:04.848
I bought a new car a couple of months ago.
Maybe the Audi dealer needs a favor now.

00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:07.642
Mr. Grant, this is the NYPD.

00:53:07.726 --> 00:53:09.644
We need to ask you a few questions, please.

00:53:09.728 --> 00:53:13.022
Oh, my God! That's them!
Those are the cops that tried to kill us!

00:53:14.567 --> 00:53:18.444
(RASPING) Hey. Hey, yo, yo.
I'll be down in a minute.

00:53:19.071 --> 00:53:21.072
I'm having sex. I'm getting busy.

00:53:21.156 --> 00:53:23.575
Is that supposed to be me?
Or is that, like, Fat Albert or somebody?

00:53:23.659 --> 00:53:25.118
-I mean, what was that?
-I don't know what that was.

00:53:25.202 --> 00:53:27.078
-Is there another way out of here?
-Please.

00:53:27.162 --> 00:53:29.998
Down through my garage, okay?
There's a service elevator by the office.

00:53:30.082 --> 00:53:32.667
-I'll keep them busy. Just go.
-ARMSTRONG: Open the door, Mr. Grant.

00:53:33.961 --> 00:53:35.253
Hello?

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.385
-CLAIRE: Can we get out this way?
-Yeah, I think so. Whoa, whoa!

00:53:42.469 --> 00:53:45.138
Okay, they're still there.
We're not gonna be able to get past them.

00:53:45.222 --> 00:53:46.764
Think. Think. Think.

00:53:49.059 --> 00:53:51.269
-What're you doing? No, wait.
-There we go.

00:53:51.353 --> 00:53:53.396
You can't do that, Phil.
This is Holbrooke's car.

00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.273
We have to get out of here fast.
You have a better idea?

-Screw Holbrooke! What was that?

Who were you, upstairs?
Who was that person?

Giggly, flirty, charming person.
Who was that?

-What are you talking about?
-What am I talking about?

00:54:31.018 --> 00:54:34.896
When you took one look at him,
you lit up like a sparkly sparkle.

00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:36.439
-No, okay, that is not true.
-It is true.

00:54:36.523 --> 00:54:40.777
And I get it, because I lit up, too.
He is super hot! And why...

00:54:40.861 --> 00:54:45.031
Why do you need muscles
on your shoulders like that?

00:54:45.824 --> 00:54:47.325
And I am just the husband.

00:54:47.409 --> 00:54:48.826

how to load the dishwasher.

-I am the guy

who needs to work out more.

-Oh, my God. You're right.

-I keep forgetting to light up for you.
-Well, that's...

00:55:00.089 --> 00:55:03.299
Why do I keep forgetting to do that?
Oh, wait! I remember!

00:55:03.384 --> 00:55:06.844
It's because every day, I get up,
make breakfast, go to work,

00:55:06.929 --> 00:55:08.972
come home, clean the house,
pick up the kids,

00:55:09.056 --> 00:55:10.848
take them to soccer,
bring them back from soccer,

00:55:10.933 --> 00:55:12.809
cook dinner, clean up that dinner,

00:55:12.893 --> 00:55:14.978
give them a bath
and get them into their pajamas,

00:55:15.062 --> 00:55:16.521
which is a fight every night.

00:55:16.605 --> 00:55:20.066
It's a big surprise to everybody every night
that they have to wear pajamas.

And then, after I have washed everybody
else's food and boogers off of me,

00:55:25.197 --> 00:55:29.534
I use whatever energy I have left
to physically put myself into our bed

00:55:29.618 --> 00:55:32.036
instead of lighting up for you, so...

00:55:32.121 --> 00:55:34.122

We have to... Yes.

00:55:35.624 --> 00:55:37.917
We have to pull over.
I know you work hard, honey.

00:55:38.002 --> 00:55:40.878
But you know what would
make all the hard work 1 0 times easier?

00:55:41.088 --> 00:55:42.171
Me.

00:55:42.798 --> 00:55:45.216
If you would just trust me enough
to handle things once in a while,

00:55:45.300 --> 00:55:48.928

You have to do it all yourself, your way.

You got me screwing up before I even get
a chance to come through for you.

00:55:52.224 --> 00:55:55.059
And, yeah, you know what?
Maybe, occasionally,

00:55:55.144 --> 00:55:58.730
I might buy the toy made of Chinese lead,

00:55:58.814 --> 00:56:00.523
or I might make a sandwich for Ollie

00:56:00.607 --> 00:56:03.693

breaches the jelly perimeter,

00:56:04.945 --> 00:56:06.946

No.

leaving me for another man?

No, never. No.

00:56:44.485 --> 00:56:49.197
Never. No, God, if anything,
I fantasize sometimes about being alone.

-What does that mean?
-(SIGHS) I don't know.

00:56:52.951 --> 00:56:56.329
Just, there are times
when I've just thought about,

00:56:56.413 --> 00:56:58.414
on my worst day, just, you know,

00:56:58.499 --> 00:57:00.249
leaving our house
and just going someplace.

00:57:00.334 --> 00:57:05.880
Like checking into a hotel
and just being in a quiet room by myself.

00:57:05.964 --> 00:57:08.925
Just sitting in a quiet air-conditioned room,

00:57:09.009 --> 00:57:13.221
sitting down, eating my lunch
with no one touching me,

00:57:13.555 --> 00:57:16.641
drinking a Diet Sprite, by myself.

00:57:17.601 --> 00:57:19.227
That sounds awful.

00:57:19.311 --> 00:57:21.062
Look, I just wanna have one day

00:57:21.146 --> 00:57:24.440
that doesn't depend on
how everybody else's day goes.

00:57:24.525 --> 00:57:27.110
It's not like I have
some gross sex fantasy or something.

00:57:27.194 --> 00:57:30.071
That I would understand.
That makes sense to me.

00:57:30.155 --> 00:57:31.864

-He doesn't...

00:57:46.588 --> 00:57:50.091
-Wait, are you serious about Cyndi Lauper?
-Yeah, she's hot.

-Really? Like, present-day or...
-Present day.

00:57:54.054 --> 00:57:56.472
Well, it's an interesting choice.

00:57:59.226 --> 00:58:03.729
Brad said to me
that he and Haley were fine,

00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:08.067
and that they were
just really excellent roommates.

00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:12.363
That's not what we are, is it?

00:58:12.781 --> 00:58:14.031
No.

that is the filthiest thing I've ever heard.

Thing is, this ledger

01:15:41.746 --> 01:15:46.750

and information about one client,

The Tripplehorns may have stolen
the flash drive from Miletto,

but they were blackmailing the DA.

01:15:55.843 --> 01:15:58.220

Doesn't even matter now, though,

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:03.058
because the computer sticky thing
is at the bottom of the East River,

01:16:03.142 --> 01:16:06.311
which is where we'll be
if those cops catch up with us.

01:16:06.562 --> 01:16:09.147

I'm not so good with complicated plots,

01:16:11.859 --> 01:16:13.276
Honey, if I'm gonna get whacked off,

01:16:13.361 --> 01:16:16.404

I think we are.

01:16:23.079 --> 01:16:26.414
No, we might get bumped off.
We might get whacked.

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:29.834
Okay. Let me... Okay,
let me break it down for you, all righty?

01:16:29.919 --> 01:16:33.213
That guy over there.
Let's just say that guy is Crenshaw.

01:16:33.297 --> 01:16:35.423
He's a DA. He's a good guy.

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:39.052
He should be busting
people like Joe Miletto.

01:16:39.136 --> 01:16:42.347
He's a gangster. He's a bad guy.
He's very bad.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.849
But Crenshaw can't bust Miletto,

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:49.271
because Crenshaw goes to Miletto's clubs
to get hookers.

01:16:49.855 --> 01:16:53.733
Oh, boy, I hope she's really a hooker.
That would be amazing.

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:57.445
Now, Miletto makes
a flash drive implicating Crenshaw.

01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:59.489
Which Taste and Whippit steal

01:16:59.573 --> 01:17:01.366
from The Peppermint Hippo,
where she works.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:05.120
Right, they steal it
so they can blackmail the DA.

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:08.081
So, those two cops don't work for Miletto.
They work for Crenshaw.

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:09.165
Right.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:12.294
And that's why Taste was acting so weird
when you mentioned Miletto's name.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:15.130
-Right.
-Oh, my God, Phil, I totally got this.

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.799
-It has something to do with Crenshaw?
-It has...

01:17:17.883 --> 01:17:19.968
Yes, honey, it has
everything to do with Crenshaw.

01:17:20.052 --> 01:17:21.553
That's the key.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:23.722
We have to find a way to get to Crenshaw.

01:17:23.806 --> 01:17:27.934
Well, the Tripplehorns got to him
at The Peppermint Hippo.

01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:30.812
And we're the Tripplehorns.

01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:32.564
Hells yes, we are.

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.653
We're gonna need some help.

01:17:38.738 --> 01:17:40.405

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:42.240

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:50.373
Is that my tracksuit?

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:53.418
Yes, it was in the trunk of your Audi,

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.712
which is now parked
over by the East River,

01:17:55.796 --> 01:17:59.341
and is probably
in need of significant repair,

01:17:59.425 --> 01:18:01.676

I'll be able to pay you back

01:18:01.761 --> 01:18:04.429
over the next several decades.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:08.767

that I stole from your hallway,

-No...
-No, no, no. No. Here's the thing.

01:18:38.964 --> 01:18:41.716
I just wanted
to take my wife to dinner tonight.

01:18:41.801 --> 01:18:45.053
I was just hoping
that we would have one night

01:18:45.137 --> 01:18:49.641
where we could, you know, feel like new.

01:18:50.476 --> 01:18:53.478
And now, all I want to do is get us home.

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:57.190
And I've got a plan.
I've got a way to do that.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:00.568
I'm not very good with plans generally,
but I've got one.

01:19:00.653 --> 01:19:02.779
And I need help.

01:19:02.863 --> 01:19:05.490
And even though your pecs
make me wanna kill myself,

01:19:05.574 --> 01:19:09.411
and your girlfriend is so hot it's like
looking through a shimmering jet engine,

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:14.165
I know, and I believe,
that there is a real person

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.961
that understands exactly
what I'm going through right now.

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:22.173
So, please, Holbrooke,
will you let us come in?

01:19:24.135 --> 01:19:27.095
Will you let us explain to you
what we want?

01:19:28.472 --> 01:19:32.559
And will you, for the love of God,

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:34.936
put on a fucking shirt?

01:19:41.861 --> 01:19:43.987
-Come on in.
-(SOFTLY) Thank you.

01:20:02.381 --> 01:20:04.841
-PHIL: Here it is. Remember the plan?
-Barely.

01:20:14.518 --> 01:20:18.146
Let us in. This is a new girl.
She's working tonight.

01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:20.899
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'm the new girl.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:23.109
-Really?
-(FIRMLY) Yeah.

01:20:23.194 --> 01:20:25.987
-And who are you?
-I am her pimp daddy.

01:20:26.071 --> 01:20:27.822
(SCOFFS) You're her pimp?

01:20:29.033 --> 01:20:30.116
That right.

01:20:30.201 --> 01:20:33.286
-Really?
-Yeah, dummy, he's my pimp.

01:20:33.370 --> 01:20:34.871
So can I go inside and start my shift,

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:39.250
or do I have to call Joey Miletto
and tell him that his bellboy made me late?

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:47.675
(WHISPERING) I don't really have gum.

01:20:48.928 --> 01:20:51.679
-The locker rooms are on the left.
-Come on, pimp.

01:20:56.769 --> 01:20:57.977
(ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING)

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:06.653
-(WHISPERING) Wait right here.
-Where are you going?

01:21:19.291 --> 01:21:21.376
Hey, do you have anything in a size eight?

01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.087
What? Gross. No.

01:21:28.342 --> 01:21:29.509
(SIGHS)

01:21:31.679 --> 01:21:33.930
Oh, no. That's for a monkey.

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:40.228
Okay.

01:21:46.068 --> 01:21:48.611
Hey, I'm a man on the bottom.
You into that?

01:21:48.696 --> 01:21:50.738
I'm sorry. I... Oh, my God!

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:52.907
I know. I know. Shut up. It's...

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:54.492
You look awesome!

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:58.204
Why is it so bright out here?
It's supposed to be dark and seedy.

01:21:58.289 --> 01:22:01.457
Give a 40-year-old stripper/mom a break.

01:22:02.585 --> 01:22:04.210
Look at your boobs!

01:22:04.295 --> 01:22:06.796
I had to put it on backwards and spin it.

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:08.256
I think I lost a nipple.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.675
No, you look great!

01:22:10.759 --> 01:22:13.261
-For reals?
-Yeah, for reals.

01:22:13.345 --> 01:22:16.347
It's the only one long enough
to cover my C-section scar.

01:22:16.432 --> 01:22:19.601
-I cannot stop looking at your boobs.
-Come on.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.269
-Okay, let's go.
-Okay.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:22.854
I want you to buy that.

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:35.366

(MOUTHING)

01:23:00.559 --> 01:23:03.478
-Honey, I don't think I can do this.
-Yes, you can. Yes, you can.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:07.148
Honey, listen to me.
You are a beautiful, strong woman.

01:23:07.232 --> 01:23:09.067
You are the mother of my children.

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:11.319
Now, I want you to go in there

01:23:11.403 --> 01:23:14.447
and pop that coochie.

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.157
-Pop the coochie.
-Just pop it out.

01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:17.784
-So we can go home.
-Let's go pop it.

01:23:17.868 --> 01:23:19.786
-Come on.
-For the kids.

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:23.790
Uh-uh.

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:25.792
I'm here for Crenshaw.

01:23:26.669 --> 01:23:28.836
Look up, please.

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:37.095
Okay, head on in.

01:23:37.805 --> 01:23:39.013
-I'll be waiting right here.
-Okay.

01:23:39.098 --> 01:23:40.723
No. The both of you.

01:23:41.934 --> 01:23:43.893
He likes you, too.

01:23:44.853 --> 01:23:47.605
Well, well, well.
Somebody caught the pervert's eye.

01:23:47.690 --> 01:23:49.857
-No, no, no, no. I can't do this.
-Yeah, you can,

01:23:49.942 --> 01:23:52.360
because you are
a beautiful and amazing man,

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:53.903
and the father of my children,

01:23:53.987 --> 01:23:56.614
and you are gonna get in there
and work that pole like a runaway.

01:23:56.699 --> 01:23:59.242
I don't... Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:24:02.454 --> 01:24:03.913
(MUSIC PLAYING)

01:24:07.376 --> 01:24:10.461
There he is, over there in the sunglasses.

01:24:12.715 --> 01:24:14.966
(GASPS) He has his broom with him.

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:17.927
Oh, that's gross. Why does he need that?

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:20.012
Probably a lot of messes he makes in here.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:23.266
Needs a mop to clean up
all the splooge in this place.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:26.436
-Phil! Ew!
-I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry.

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:30.356
-Can I help you?
-Yeah, we're here to see Crenshaw.

01:24:30.566 --> 01:24:33.651
No one gets close to Crenshaw
unless he picks you.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:37.405
-Picks us, yes. Picks us for what?
-CRENSHAW: Carlton, move aside.

01:24:37.489 --> 01:24:38.990
(CHUCKLING) Move aside.

01:24:40.576 --> 01:24:44.996
I like your look, honey.
Very Wild West saloon chick.

01:24:45.497 --> 01:24:47.290
Minus the syphilis.

01:24:47.458 --> 01:24:48.624

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:51.961
You got a mouth on you.
I like that. I like that.

01:24:52.045 --> 01:24:54.672
And you brought your androgynous friend.

01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:57.592
Oh! Oh! Oh! Is it a man or a woman?

01:24:57.676 --> 01:24:59.552
(LAUGHING) I don't know! I don't know!

01:25:00.471 --> 01:25:02.180
It's very sexy.

01:25:02.264 --> 01:25:04.640
I am going to keep you guessing.

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:05.850
Whoo!

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:09.228
Why don't you two show me what you got?

01:25:09.313 --> 01:25:11.272
(SOFTLY) I think he wants us
to have sex in front of him.

01:25:11.356 --> 01:25:12.815
-Mmm-mmm.
-If we have to do it,

01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:14.567
-we'll do the fast version.
-Oh, God.

01:25:14.651 --> 01:25:18.696
Come on, if you're gonna
spend time with me, you have to earn it.

01:25:18.781 --> 01:25:20.239
So get on up there.

Ladies, please, please.
Move to the side. Thank you.

01:25:24.203 --> 01:25:25.953

Hey... Okay.

01:25:27.414 --> 01:25:31.000
We're not into dancing so much.
We would ratherjust talk to you

01:25:31.084 --> 01:25:34.086
-while remaining relatively still.
-Yeah. Just wanna, like, talk to you.

01:25:34.171 --> 01:25:37.215
I don't come here to talk.
You either leave or you start dancing.

01:25:37.299 --> 01:25:40.259

that's worth that kind of money.

01:28:32.349 --> 01:28:35.267

I got to go back in the subway
for a refresher.

CRENSHAW: Okay.

01:29:12.431 --> 01:29:15.641
Let's make this simple, okay?
You give me the flash drive,

01:29:15.726 --> 01:29:18.686
or Collins is going to break
both your wife's arms.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:21.897
I put the flash drive someplace
no one is ever going to find it.

01:29:21.982 --> 01:29:23.566
But if our associate, Mr. Holbrooke Grant,

01:29:23.650 --> 01:29:26.944
doesn't hear from us
every hour on the hour until we're safe,

01:29:27.029 --> 01:29:30.281
then he will release
the contents of that drive.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:34.452
He's the ex-military guy
we questioned tonight.

01:29:34.536 --> 01:29:36.620

we're trying to do a rooftop thing.

-Could you just give us a minute?
-Frank?

01:29:43.754 --> 01:29:47.423
No! I can't give you a minute.
This is my rooftop, toots!

Okay.

01:29:49.342 --> 01:29:50.926
It's okay, Claire. We were expecting him.

01:29:51.011 --> 01:29:55.056
-What? Oh, my God! I am so lost.
-They were just about to leave, Joe.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:57.183
You know, they got a guy on the outside
that has the flash drive.

01:29:57.267 --> 01:29:58.976
Yeah, the flash drive. There's no play here.

01:29:59.061 --> 01:30:00.269
You've seen the flash drive?

01:30:00.353 --> 01:30:04.231
Oh, don't worry, though.
