Hello, my name is Sean Anders.
Screenwriter and director of <i>Sex Drive. </i>

2
00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:14.246
Hi, John. I didn't see you there.

3
00:00:14.322 --> 00:00:19.157
-This is John Morris.
-Screenwriter and producer of <i>Sex Drive. </i>

00:00:19.227 --> 00:00:22.060
-Welcome to the unrated...
-Uncircumcised...

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:27.958
How many times has this happened to you?

8
00:00:28.036 --> 00:00:32.370
You purchase an unrated DVD to view
with your friends. Only with your friends...

9
00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.570
Only to find that you got the same
old movie with a few extra curse words,

10
00:00:36.644 --> 00:00:38.942
and maybe an additional tit or two.

11
00:00:39.014 --> 00:00:41.073
-What a jip.
-And how...

12
00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.480
Not this time.

13
00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.714
That's right, John.
On this unrated DVD we promise you,

14
00:00:46.788 --> 00:00:48.119
the viewer,

15
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.149
a genuinely wacky, zany
and unrated viewing experience.

16
00:00:53.228 --> 00:00:56.129
-We promise...
-Plus, we promise more tits.

17
00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:58.461
Bare tits like these.

18
00:01:00.201 --> 00:01:02.032
These tits are good.

19
00:01:03.038 --> 00:01:06.007
Plus, more cock, like this.

20
00:01:07.142 --> 00:01:09.042
That's good cock, John.

21
00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:13.777
That's right, John, and that's not all,
we promise lots of additional scenes,

22
00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:18.182
takes and other bullshit
that will make the movie way too long.

23
00:01:18.253 --> 00:01:21.017
And this means a lower standard
of filmmaking for you,

24
00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:22.078
-the viewer.
-The viewer.

25
00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:26.851
So, if you've never seen <i>Sex Drive</i> before,
please, for real,

26
00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:29.396
do not watch this version first.

27
00:01:29.464 --> 00:01:33.195
Watch the real theatrical version
and then come back and watch this one.

28
00:01:33.268 --> 00:01:34.360
Why?

29
00:01:34.436 --> 00:01:38.998
Yes, because this version
of the movie is going to suck.

30
00:01:46.114 --> 00:01:50.073
Sorry, but I couldn't help but notice you.
I have this exact same tribal tattoo.

31

175
00:12:31.959 --> 00:12:35.417
Well, you look nice.

176
00:12:36.163 --> 00:12:38.324
You know, sweetie,
there's still time to have your boobs done

177
00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.559
before my wedding.

178
00:12:39.633 --> 00:12:42.101
Darren and I already discussed them,
and he said he'd pay for it.

179
00:12:42.169 --> 00:12:45.332
I mean, he's a dentist,
so it's totally not a big deal.

180

Excuse me, do you have a pair of scissors?

181
00:12:48.876 --> 00:12:50.935
Oh! Sure, sweetie. Do you have a stringie?

182
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:54.503
Oh, no. I was just hoping
you could slit my wrists for me quickly.

183

Hello. This is a coupon
for six free donuts. Donuts?

Oh, my God! You look so hot in that.

187
00:13:19.707 --> 00:13:22.642
Hey, sweetheart, listen.
Please don't take this the wrong way,

188
00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:24.644
but your whole trying too hard thing,

189
00:13:24.712 --> 00:13:27.374
it's just coming across as needy,
you know?

190
00:13:27.448 --> 00:13:29.780
And I think you're better than that,
Kimberly.

191
00:13:29.850 --> 00:13:34.753
-But all I was saying was that...
-Shh! Let's see it in a large. Okay?

192

I'm out buying him clothes right now.

I'm losing you. I'm going into a tunnel.

195
00:13:47.067 --> 00:13:50.798
Well, it's official, Lance,
your mom's still bat-shit crazy.

196
00:13:50.871 --> 00:13:53.169
What? You're telling me
she doesn't shit-talk me?

197
00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.141
No, actually, she doesn't. She doesn't, ever.

198
00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:59.043
All right. Let me give you some advice,
Lance, all right?

199

Don't ever get married.
Just an endless parade of horseshit.

always wear a rubber. Christ.

when you talk to us?

you gonna bring her to my party tonight?

216

-Yeah, I asked her. She said no.
-Good. Dude, she's totally wrong for you.

217

the fucking costume again, right?

-Dude, if you told her to fuck off,

220

she'd be two knuckles deep right now
daydreaming about your big black cock.

221

I'm teaching you to walk sometimes.

Yeah, kind of. Being kind of a dick.
I'd say... No, not really.

236

I've sort of been practicing

849

No, no, no. Leesh, that's a bad idea.

-Come on.

The Internet?

858
00:55:13.285 --> 00:55:17.847
Yeah, it's like a series of computers
that are connected through...

859
00:55:17.922 --> 00:55:19.253

860
00:55:20.892 --> 00:55:24.487

Yeah, that ska band from Delaware.

865
00:55:34.372 --> 00:55:38.570
No, it means "run wild. " It's an Amish
tradition where when we turn 16,

866
00:55:38.643 --> 00:55:41.203
we can go live like you heathens
for a while.

867

You go nuts, party for months or years
till your folks start hassling you,

868

what's with the buggy?

-I know.

and I was like, "you want this?"

So she's like, "Yeah, I want it, I want it. "

904

And I was like,
yeah, this gets hotter by the second.

"What're you crying about?" She's like,
"... wanted to be a doctor. "

"Yeah, you're a fucking Ph. D. of cock. "

02:02:00.454 --> 02:02:02.445
<i>Let's see, what else?</i>

1808
02:02:03.090 --> 02:02:05.615
<i>Oh, Andy and Randy finally got a girlfriend. </i>

1809
02:02:08.529 --> 02:02:11.930
<i>And on New Year's Eve,
Felicia and I finally visited Grandma. </i>

1810
02:02:11.999 --> 02:02:13.057
Again?

1811
02:02:14.335 --> 02:02:15.768
Damn, yes.

1812
02:02:18.439 --> 02:02:20.464
-Felicia, you want to do this?
-Yes.

1813
02:02:27.047 --> 02:02:28.446
(LAUGHING)

1814
02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:31.113
Oh, that was awesome!

1815
02:03:11.358 --> 02:03:15.294
-Hey, boys. You get some rest?
-Thanks, man. Thanks for fixing the bus.

1816
02:03:15.362 --> 02:03:17.125
-A pleasure.
-Yeah, thanks for fixing our bus.

1817
02:03:17.197 --> 02:03:19.597
-Appreciate it.
-Thanks for playing that show for us, too.

1818
02:03:19.667 --> 02:03:23.000
-Yeah, no worries.
-It was a nice five-song set.

1819
02:03:23.070 --> 02:03:25.470
Yeah, what do you guys typically...

1820
02:03:25.539 --> 02:03:27.973
I assume you get compensated
very well for that.

1821
02:03:28.042 --> 02:03:30.943
-Must be a good living.
-Yeah, we do. I mean...

1822
02:03:31.011 --> 02:03:33.912
Yeah, you know, I...
Gosh, if I was really to calculate

1823
02:03:33.981 --> 02:03:37.109
what you'd lose if this bus
couldn't have gotten back on the road,

1824
02:03:37.184 --> 02:03:38.378
if you couldn't have gotten to your shows,

1825
02:03:38.452 --> 02:03:43.321
I imagine all those weeping teenage girls
outside, "I need to dance. "

1826
02:03:43.390 --> 02:03:46.359
Could we send you some pictures?
We don't really have cash or anything.

1827
02:03:46.427 --> 02:03:49.396
-Some autographed photos?
-Or we could give you CDs.

1828
02:03:49.463 --> 02:03:51.693
Yeah, we've got a lot of use
for that around here.

1829
02:03:51.765 --> 02:03:53.858
There is a lot of work
that needs to be done around here.

1830
02:03:53.934 --> 02:03:58.200
-You guys are some strapping young lads.
-I don't know if we're really built for that.

1831
02:03:59.640 --> 02:04:02.165
-Yeah.
-I can hear you.

1832
02:04:02.242 --> 02:04:04.642
I'm just saying,
you guys put in a 20-minute show,

1833
02:04:04.712 --> 02:04:06.339
-we spent all night on the bus...
-Yeah.

1834
02:04:06.413 --> 02:04:07.607
I mean, that was a lot of work.

1835
02:04:07.681 --> 02:04:09.876
We could maybe try
to write a check later on,

1836
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:12.418
or like I said,
we could send you guys some CDs.

1837
02:04:12.486 --> 02:04:14.716
City folk are always trying to solve things
with money.

1838
02:04:14.788 --> 02:04:16.813
It's the spirit of the community
around here.

1839
02:04:16.890 --> 02:04:19.415
Lord, please bless this Fall Out Boy.

1840
02:04:19.493 --> 02:04:22.257
Keep him safe on the road.

1841
02:04:22.329 --> 02:04:25.423
Help him to aspire
to the heights of Jon Bon Jovi.

1842
02:04:25.499 --> 02:04:26.727
-Help him to...
-Thanks.

1843
02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:28.700
-Okay, thanks, man.
-Thanks, man. We gotta roll.

1844
02:04:28.769 --> 02:04:30.703
-Amen.
-We gotta roll, man. Thank you very much.

1845
02:04:30.771 --> 02:04:32.329
All right, boys.
It was a pleasure meeting you.

1846
02:04:32.406 --> 02:04:35.375
I loved your penis on the Internet,
by the way.

1847
02:04:35.442 --> 02:04:37.501
-Fucking asshole!
-You're a dick!

Hi. I'm Amanda Crew, professional actor.

You know in all the teen unrated DVDs,

1903
02:09:08.849 --> 02:09:12.410
you never really get to see
the star's naughty parts.

1904
02:09:12.886 --> 02:09:16.322
Well, that is gonna change today.

1905
02:09:16.390 --> 02:09:18.290
That's right. Take a seat,

1906
02:09:18.358 --> 02:09:21.191
maybe close the door
so mom doesn't come in.

1907
02:09:21.261 --> 02:09:24.162
Get all ready. Looks good.
